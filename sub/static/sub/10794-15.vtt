WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:05.039
RUSH: I may be on
 the verge of discovering

00:05.073 --> 00:07.508
the true nature of
 Destiny's mission.

00:09.277 --> 00:12.080
ELI: You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time!

00:12.113 --> 00:13.747
Why wouldn't you
 tell anyone?

00:13.781 --> 00:17.318
The Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.221
YOUNG: I killed Riley.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.756
You are a good commander.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.393
YOUNG: There is no mission
 other than getting
 these people home.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.261
RUSH: It was never about
 going home,

00:27.295 --> 00:28.696
it's about getting us
 to where we're going.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.732
That is the mission.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.102
RUSH: Ginn was strangled
 by Simeon.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.105
YOUNG: And we
 received confirmation that
 Dr. Perry died on Earth.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.372
BRODY: I think
 we have a connection.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.774
You're aboard the Destiny.
I'm Colonel Young.
Who are you?

00:40.808 --> 00:42.843
I'm Ginn.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.945
If Ginn is in Chloe's body,
 whose body is Chloe
 connected to?

00:44.978 --> 00:46.680
Chloe?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.782
No, Amanda Perry.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.119
RUSH: I do have another idea.
 The neural interface chair.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.953
We can isolate
 each consciousness

00:52.986 --> 00:54.655
and upload them
 into Destiny's
 memory bank.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.125
It worked.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.459
Thank you.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.261
GINN: I know
 it's only temporary.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.929
ELI: But for now,
 it's the best we can do.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.068
Mr. Ambassador,

01:08.102 --> 01:11.805
when we first spoke of
 using your planet's core
 as the power source

01:11.839 --> 01:16.710
to dial the nine
chevron address, it was
a scientific mystery.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.712
Now it has become
 a necessity.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.880
It was always
 your intention
 to send people.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.215
Not these people.

01:21.249 --> 01:22.983
Not so unprepared.

01:23.016 --> 01:26.287
If we could open
a supply line of equipment
and relief personnel...

01:26.320 --> 01:27.721
Mr. Woolsey...

01:27.755 --> 01:29.089
The planets with
the required properties

01:29.123 --> 01:31.959
to do this
are exceedingly rare.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.795
What's more,
 99% of the work
 is already done.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.498
Your facility draws
power from the core,
the Stargate is in place...

01:37.531 --> 01:39.099
Twice this has
 been attempted,

01:39.133 --> 01:40.834
and twice the planets
 were destroyed

01:40.868 --> 01:42.736
by a catastrophic
 chain reaction.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.473
The overload at Icarus
 was a direct result of
 the enemy bombardment.

01:45.506 --> 01:46.407
In the second case...
 We acknowledge

01:46.440 --> 01:49.343
there were
mitigating factors
in both cases.

01:49.377 --> 01:53.314
Nevertheless, our scientists
 believe Dr. Rush's solution
 is inherently dangerous.

01:53.347 --> 01:56.784
Which is why we asked you
 to come here, sir.
 We have a new solution.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.530
Ambassador Ovirda,
 Dr. Rodney McKay.

02:09.562 --> 02:13.434
Ambassador, gentlemen.
This will just take
a second to boot up.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.735
There isn't anywhere
 I can plug in, is there?

02:15.569 --> 02:16.470
Ah, it'll be fine.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.479
PERRY: Knight to
queen's bishop five.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.293
Move it yourself.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.361
(BOTH LAUGH)

02:40.394 --> 02:41.929
Very funny.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.199
You're not concentrating.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.400
(SIGHS) Well,
 I couldn't beat you

02:46.434 --> 02:47.835
when you were
a flesh and blood person.

02:47.868 --> 02:48.936
What chance do I have now?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.205
I'm a person, Nick.

02:51.239 --> 02:54.174
Of course you are.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.410
I mean...
 What I meant to say,
 what I should have said,

02:57.911 --> 03:00.047
is that you're
more than that.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.915
I'm still me.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.417
What are you doing
 right now?

03:03.451 --> 03:04.885
I'm here with you.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.919
And?

03:07.888 --> 03:12.059
And analyzing the structure
you found in the database,

03:12.092 --> 03:13.494
and accessing
 the ship's sensors

03:13.527 --> 03:14.928
so I can study
 the nearest...

03:14.962 --> 03:16.264
Wow.

03:19.933 --> 03:23.103
Okay. You have a point.

03:23.136 --> 03:27.174
So much more than
 a flesh and blood person.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.042
Then why
 is that the only thing
 I dream about?

03:31.412 --> 03:35.883
I have the same dream,
 and you're in it.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.094
There is a way.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.044
Okay, good to go.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.247
Sorry. Now,
I'm sure we're all familiar
with the old adage,

04:07.281 --> 04:08.215
"It's all in the algorithm,"
 so...

04:08.248 --> 04:10.418
Doctor.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.985
I'm going to stop you there.
 All I said was "so."

04:12.019 --> 04:13.321
I'm not a scientist.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.955
No, that's not a problem.
 I dumbed it down.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.156
There's no point
 in wasting our time.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.891
No, I can talk
 very, very fast.

04:17.925 --> 04:18.926
Let me ask you this.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.494
If our roles were reversed,

04:20.528 --> 04:23.331
would you be so blithe
 as to put Earth's
 population at risk?

04:23.364 --> 04:24.598
There's no risk.
 That's the point.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.400
Hopefully once
 our own scientists

04:26.434 --> 04:27.901
have had a chance
 to go over your work,

04:27.935 --> 04:28.969
they'll reach
 the same conclusion.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.571
There's no time for that.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.573
Colonel...
The Lucian Alliance
wants Destiny.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.908
They know that your facility
 can get them there

04:34.942 --> 04:37.678
and you know damn well
that they will not take
no for an answer.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.113
There's an excellent
 argument to dismantle
 the facility altogether.

04:40.147 --> 04:43.016
Don't think that
 that will stop them.
 They will move in faster.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.352
They will do anything
to get to the Destiny,

04:44.385 --> 04:47.187
and won't give a damn
if they blow up your planet
in the process.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.989
Then don't let them.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.124
If we were allowed
 to show you

04:51.158 --> 04:53.427
that Dr. McKay's
 dialing solution is safe.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.129
That is the price
 of your protection
 from the Lucian Alliance?

04:56.163 --> 04:58.265
As a life-long
 practitioner of diplomacy,

04:58.298 --> 05:02.536
you must understand
 that sovereign states act
 in their own interest.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.072
The defense of
 a supply line, for example.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.174
For example.

05:09.510 --> 05:13.313
If and when our scientists
 reach the same conclusion
 as Dr. McKay...

05:13.347 --> 05:15.649
No, no, no, it could
 take months for them to
 understand the science.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.551
Then that is how long
 you will have to wait.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.387
The Alliance
 won't be as patient.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.056
I have no choice
 but to hope that
 you're wrong.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.527
Good day, gentlemen.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.672
The Lucian Alliance
 got to them.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.040
He just proved that to me.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.613
We have to move.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.450
He didn't even
 look at my work.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.419
Because he wouldn't
have understood it
in the first place.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.721
You saw my presentation.
 A cat could understand it.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.556
And he knows
 their government
 will only listen

05:55.589 --> 05:57.491
to the assurances
 of their own experts.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.427
We would do the same.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.161
They've already made a deal
with the Lucian Alliance.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.596
I seriously doubt that.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.697
I can prove it.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.266
David, how'd it go?

06:06.299 --> 06:07.735
Pretty much
 like I expected.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.604
YOUNG: Dr. McKay,
 your reputation
 precedes you.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.105
Some of it even good.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.340
And you are?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.208
TELFORD: Sorry,
 communication stones.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.610
This is
 actually Colonel Young,
 commander of the Destiny.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.246
You know Woolsey.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.281
You said something
 about proof?

06:21.314 --> 06:23.717
Not exactly,
but close enough.

06:23.751 --> 06:27.020
We've parked a dozen
 or so listening satellites
 around Langara.

06:27.054 --> 06:27.988
The communications
 are encrypted

06:28.021 --> 06:30.357
in a Lucian Alliance cipher
we haven't broken,

06:30.390 --> 06:31.659
but there's enough
 back and forth to suggest

06:31.692 --> 06:34.227
that some sort of negotiation
 has been going on
 for some time.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.596
Does the IOA know this?

06:35.629 --> 06:37.465
General O'Neill
 briefed the chairman

06:37.498 --> 06:39.467
and the president
 this morning in an
 emergency meeting.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.369
We are in an undeclared war
 with the Alliance.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.438
Now, if the Langarans
 have already sided with them,
 they can launch

06:44.472 --> 06:47.107
another attack on Destiny
 at almost any point.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.309
Without the benefit
of my solution.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.811
Which would make
 dialing the ninth chevron

06:50.844 --> 06:53.113
a hell of
 a lot more dangerous
 for the Langarans.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.449
So we're protecting
 them from themselves,
 is that it?

06:55.483 --> 06:57.585
If that's how you
 want to put it, sure.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.386
The General's authorized
 a mission to Langara.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.655
What sort of mission?

07:01.689 --> 07:03.423
We're calling it
 a "proof of concept,"
 but before we get into that,

07:03.457 --> 07:04.592
we'll need McKay
 to run through
 his presentation.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.026
Oh, okay.
 Not here.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.141
Who's this?

07:21.174 --> 07:22.676
That's a good question.
Where's Rush?

07:22.710 --> 07:24.612
He sent Mr. Brody
 in his place.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.313
He said you wouldn't care.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.681
Well, I don't.
 Doesn't mean he can do
 whatever he wants.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.816
McKAY: (STUTTERS)
 What's wrong?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.083
Rush was supposed
 to switch with you

07:30.117 --> 07:31.652
and go over
 your data on Earth.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.520
I thought I was
 here to talk to Rush.
 No, no, no,

07:32.553 --> 07:34.187
you're here to talk to Eli.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.823
You convince him,
 you've convinced me.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.525
Lieutenant,
would you mind?
 Yes, sir.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.192
I'll take care of it.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.595
Rush, this is Young.
 Where are you?

07:41.629 --> 07:43.130
I'm up here.
 Right, of course.

07:43.163 --> 07:46.166
We met at Stargate Command.
It's Vanessa, right?

07:46.199 --> 07:46.800
Yeah.
 Hmm.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.702
After you.

07:48.736 --> 07:49.837
No, ladies first.

07:53.406 --> 07:54.407
I'll go.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.712
Hey.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.314
He ran into me,
 literally, a while ago
 in a hurry somewhere.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.616
He didn't say anything?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.384
He said to tell you
 he was taking the day off.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.353
What does that mean?
 That's what I said.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.455
We just found him.
 His vitals are stable.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.524
There's some kind
 of program running that
 I've never seen before.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.359
Don't ask 'cause
 I don't got a clue.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.861
Haven't you heard?
 He's taking the day off.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.897
Looks more like
 he's taking a nap!
 I'm reading delta waves.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.299
Stage four sleep.
 Very deep.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.568
So now I say,
 "Wake the bastard up,"

08:20.601 --> 08:21.569
and you tell me
 it's dangerous.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.171
Well, it is.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.205
All right, well,
 let's find out what
 the hell he's doing,

08:25.238 --> 08:26.273
and report back to me.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.910
(KISSES)

08:29.943 --> 08:34.914
You are in an immersive
 simulation program.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.417
It's already in
 the Destiny's database.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.152
In fact, some of you have
 already experienced it.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.253
Colonel Young's
 no-win scenario.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.288
Hmm.

08:44.758 --> 08:51.699
It was already so capable
 of hyper-realistic
 sensory input,

08:51.732 --> 08:55.368
all I had to do was
 find a way that we could
 experience it together.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.172
And that's where
the chair comes in.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.442
In a way, you're outside
 of your physical body
 right now.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.880
This would've been
 no fun at all if it was
 only in your head.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.816
This way we can feel
 each other's touch.

09:13.420 --> 09:17.891
You must have had to put in
 some kind of conditions

09:17.925 --> 09:20.427
in order for the scenario
 to play out.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.863
That was the easy part.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.364
The parameters
 are so simple

09:24.397 --> 09:26.466
that you should be able
 to come and go as you wish.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.737
So it's just
 the two of us, then,
 in our own little world.

09:29.770 --> 09:33.707
We have the whole
 matrix of the ship
 to ourselves.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.976
I think we could even
 take a shuttle somewhere

09:36.009 --> 09:37.611
if we really wanted to.

09:37.645 --> 09:40.848
Oh, really?
 Well, maybe we'll
 try that sometime.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.685
Not now.
 Definitely not now.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.261
Greer, are you nuts?
 (GREER GRUNTING)

09:54.294 --> 09:56.463
You just donated
 a damn kidney.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.298
I just needed
 some exercise.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.802
There you are!
Sorry, Colonel,
he snuck out.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.804
Listen to me, Ronald,
 you're no good to me dead.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.505
I need you to get back
 to the infirmary.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.807
(PANTING)

10:06.840 --> 10:07.841
Yes, sir.
 Okay.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.342
Yes, sir.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.413
No, no, no.
 See, this is where you
 are completely wrong.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.848
It is impossible
 to make that deduction

10:14.882 --> 10:16.449
because it falls outside
of the boundary conditions.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.685
This changes
 the boundary conditions!

10:17.718 --> 10:19.252
It doesn't work that way!

10:19.286 --> 10:21.321
If you make the change,
 yes, it does!

10:21.354 --> 10:23.356
Read the writing
on the wall, man.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.625
Listen, kid,
 one semester at MIT
 does not make you...

10:25.659 --> 10:27.695
Gentlemen! I take it
 there are problems
 with this?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.797
What?

10:29.830 --> 10:31.364
He thinks we're talking
 about your nine chevron
 dialing solution.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.633
No, no, no, no, no,
we've moved on.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.869
Very, very bright,
this kid.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.504
I mean, in many ways
 he reminds me of me
 at that age.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.306
Of course, I was carrying
 around a lot less...

10:39.339 --> 10:40.607
Hair?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.609
YOUNG: So, it'll work?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.678
Yeah, yeah.
 I wish I'd thought of it.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.980
Thank you.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.315
Great. Just to be clear,
 without blowing up
 the planet?

10:48.348 --> 10:49.616
I'd say the odds
 of that are...

10:49.649 --> 10:51.518
Statistically zero.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.321
YOUNG: Good.

10:54.354 --> 10:54.822
Now, Rush's
 original calculations
 were sound,

10:54.855 --> 10:56.056
don't get me wrong.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.558
It's just that
he was using a trinary
instead of a quad base,

10:58.591 --> 10:59.893
which threw off...
 I don't really care,

10:59.927 --> 11:02.529
just as long as Eli says
 we're good to go.

11:02.562 --> 11:03.731
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.498
Let's go.
 I just got here!

11:05.532 --> 11:06.666
Well, you can
 come back anytime.

11:06.700 --> 11:10.403
In fact, we pull this off,
 you can come back in person.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.571
This is not over, mister.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.040
(SCOFFS) Bring it!

11:16.944 --> 11:18.478
TELFORD: Brody bought
 McKay's solution.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.313
Of course he did.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.549
Look, he didn't eat
 any citrus when he was
 in my body, did he?

11:22.582 --> 11:24.684
'Cause I am not
 feeling well.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.353
I assume this means
 you're going ahead
 with your mission.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.420
I don't see that
 there's a choice.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.723
Of course there is!

11:29.757 --> 11:32.492
Clearly the Alliance
 is putting something
 substantial on the table.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.693
If we go to them
 with some sort

11:33.727 --> 11:35.763
of a peace offering
 of our own...

11:35.796 --> 11:38.431
General O'Neill believes
 the Alliance will move
 in a matter of days,

11:38.465 --> 11:41.601
whether they're
 invited or not by the
 Langaran Government.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.670
He also believes
 the Langarans would prefer
 siding with us

11:43.703 --> 11:45.605
if given the choice.
 I agree wholeheartedly.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.875
YOUNG: Well, the goal
 of our mission

11:47.908 --> 11:50.043
is to make that choice
 easier by proving that
 Dr. McKay's solution is safe.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.078
Oh, it's safe!

11:51.111 --> 11:52.946
TELFORD: Our secondary goal
would be to determine

11:52.980 --> 11:54.447
whether or not
they've already made a deal

11:54.481 --> 11:55.916
with the other side.
 And if we find that out?

11:55.949 --> 11:58.585
Well, then we will
 act accordingly.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.953
The Lucian Alliance
is not going to be

11:59.987 --> 12:01.822
allowed to attack
 Destin again.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.359
I think I can speak
for both of us when I say

12:06.393 --> 12:09.729
that if your intention
 is to take their facility
 by force,

12:09.763 --> 12:11.564
we'll have no part of it.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.433
YOUNG: No, of course not,
 Mr. Woolsey.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.403
We're going to give
them a peace offering.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.543
T.J., any change?

12:23.576 --> 12:26.746
I don't think he's asleep.
 He's in something closer
 to a coma.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.581
What's wrong with this guy?
 YOUNG: You know what, T.J.?

12:28.615 --> 12:30.784
This timing sucks,
but Scott and I,
we've got to do this thing.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.419
You're in charge.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.054
Keep a defense team
in the Gate Room
at all times.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.056
Yes, sir.
 I also need you
 to check in on Greer.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.390
I ran into him in
 the corridor this morning.
 What?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.458
Yeah, he didn't look good.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.492
No, he shouldn't
 be walking around.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.627
Right.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.964
Aside from
 "taking the day off,"

12:43.997 --> 12:46.566
did Rush say anything
 that might give us a clue
 as to why he did this?

12:46.599 --> 12:47.835
Not to me.
 YOUNG: Maybe he
 couldn't bring

12:47.868 --> 12:49.837
himself to see how McKay
 improved on his work.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.772
Look, I'm not saying
 he doesn't have an ego
 the size of a bus,

12:52.806 --> 12:55.742
but Rush would kill
to bring people and
supplies from Earth.

12:55.775 --> 13:00.480
So, what was so important?

13:00.513 --> 13:04.517
I'm sure he planned
 to tell me at our
 next heart-to-heart.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.919
Just do me a favor,
 get him on his feet

13:05.953 --> 13:07.654
so I can knock him
 on his ass when I'm back.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.528
Sorry, I didn't mean
 to wake you.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.764
(WEAKLY) Does it have
 to be so hot in here?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.132
It's not.
 You have a fever,

13:19.166 --> 13:21.101
which means you're fighting
 another infection.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.071
Good to know.
 I'll fight harder.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.674
I wish it worked that way.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.910
It does.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.079
Here.

13:36.984 --> 13:44.491
(EXHALES) See,
 I feel better already.
 How's Volker?

13:44.524 --> 13:47.694
Great, for a guy
 who's sporting someone
 else's kidney.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.497
I really didn't expect you
 to be the one who got sick.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.731
Better me than him.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.868
Why's that?

13:54.902 --> 13:56.203
'Cause I'm strong.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.741
Yeah, you are.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.944
But no more
 walking around, okay?
 You need to sleep.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.513
That's an order.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.016
Yes, ma'am.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.758
I got nothing. You?

14:18.791 --> 14:22.729
There's hardly any
 brain activity at all,
 it's like he's not even...

14:25.798 --> 14:28.268
Go back in the logs
as far as you can.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.970
His present physical state
 has nothing to do with this.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.606
BRODY: Holy crap.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.676
Yeah. That is one hell
 of an upload.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.745
Over 900 terabytes
 were transferred into
 Destiny's memory.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.082
Eli, what am I looking at?

14:42.115 --> 14:45.818
The complete and unabridged
 consciousness of
 one Nicholas Rush.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.489
RUSH: Feels strange
 with no one else around.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.860
(LAUGHS) Thanks a lot.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.965
You know what I mean.
 It must be different
 for you, too.

14:57.998 --> 15:02.735
Yeah, it's hard to explain.

15:02.769 --> 15:05.272
I mean, there are hours
 when I feel oblivious
 to the fact

15:05.305 --> 15:07.040
that there are even
 other people aboard.
 Yeah?

15:07.074 --> 15:09.876
Like when I'm looking
 outside of the ship,

15:09.909 --> 15:12.079
taking in the galaxy
 around us,

15:12.112 --> 15:13.981
and then at
 other times I can pore

15:14.014 --> 15:15.648
through data
 in fractions of a second

15:15.682 --> 15:17.250
that would take me hours
 to read if I was...

15:18.818 --> 15:20.187
If you were a...

15:21.854 --> 15:23.156
What, a person, you mean?

15:23.190 --> 15:25.825
I much prefer
 being here with you.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.660
I mean, physically here.

15:29.096 --> 15:33.700
Existing as consciousness
 is lonely.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.038
Now, you needn't be
 lonely ever again.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.875
You have no idea
 how happy it makes me
 to hear you say that.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.749
In fact,

15:49.782 --> 15:54.887
if there was a way
for me to interact with
 Destiny real systems,

15:56.123 --> 15:58.358
we could spend even
more time together.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.027
But we can't.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.195
The system is isolated.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.197
It wouldn't be much
of a simulation

16:04.231 --> 16:07.100
if it had real-world
 repercussions, would it?

16:07.134 --> 16:10.170
We'd best let
 Eli and Ginn know
 for their sake.

16:10.203 --> 16:13.006
For now is it okay
 if we keep it our secret?

16:13.040 --> 16:14.641
Yeah, of course.

16:16.909 --> 16:17.910
I really need to go now.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.382
Do you have to?

16:22.415 --> 16:25.018
Well, for one,
 I've been away
 long enough

16:25.052 --> 16:26.886
for Colonel Young
 to start getting hysterical.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.155
(LAUGHS)

16:28.188 --> 16:30.257
And another is,
I have to work.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.328
So, is there
 a door somewhere,

16:35.362 --> 16:36.829
or do I just click
my heels together?

16:39.232 --> 16:41.000
It's even easier
 than that.

16:47.874 --> 16:51.178
All you need to do is sit,
 close your eyes,

16:51.211 --> 16:53.080
and when you open them,
 you'll be back.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.347
Yeah!

16:54.381 --> 16:55.982
And the shouting
 and the pointing

16:56.015 --> 16:58.851
and the demanding
of answers shall begin.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.287
I cannot wait.

17:03.056 --> 17:07.359
But you'll be
 back soon, won't you?

17:07.394 --> 17:10.963
Well, you can
 always come visit me
 in the real world.

17:17.137 --> 17:20.073
I know it's not
 the same thing, but...

17:20.107 --> 17:21.941
Hey, at least
 you know I love you

17:21.973 --> 17:23.210
for your mind
 as well as your body.

17:29.048 --> 17:29.982
Yes.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.253
Go, sit.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.291
I'll come say
 good night to you later.

17:38.325 --> 17:39.892
I'll see you then.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.838

18:47.227 --> 18:48.828
You are not expected.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.364
I am here at the request
 of my government,

18:51.398 --> 18:56.203
bearing gifts for both
the ambassador and your
chief administrator.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.338
Should I call him
 for you, sir?

18:58.371 --> 19:01.874
Not yet.
 What sort of gifts?

19:02.509 --> 19:04.944
Symbols of our friendship.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.847
Artifacts carved by
the Ancients themselves

19:07.880 --> 19:09.782
over a million years ago.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.219
I would prefer
 it if you didn't.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.053
You don't think I would
 allow you to give
 something like this

19:14.086 --> 19:15.188
to Administrator Halpurn

19:15.222 --> 19:16.823
without looking it
 over first.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.358

19:18.391 --> 19:19.826

19:23.230 --> 19:24.231
(GASPS)

19:26.399 --> 19:28.901
Well, Captain?
 Is it acceptable?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.337
Looks fine to me.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.372
Then may I present it
 to the administrator?

19:32.405 --> 19:33.840
Absolutely.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.375
Excellent. I know the way.

19:44.116 --> 19:45.117
Ahhh!

19:46.118 --> 19:47.153
What is this?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.421
You're on board the Destiny.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.156
I promise you,
 you won't be harmed,

19:50.189 --> 19:52.959
and you will be returned
 to your own body shortly.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.338
Woolsey! What are
 you doing here?

20:05.372 --> 20:06.406
He's brought a gift, sir.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.174
For you and the ambassador.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.076
I've already inspected it,
 I'm sure it's harmless.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.077
Captain, what you
 should have done is

20:11.110 --> 20:14.080
instruct Mr. Woolsey
to return home immediately.

20:14.113 --> 20:17.884
At least read the inscription
 on the bottom of the stone.
 Please.

 tell you, sir.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.061

 take too long.

Well, let's go welcome
 them to our facility.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.553
It should have worked.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.323
Well, there's no point
 in panicking just yet.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.325
Maybe you should
 try it again.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.627
I have tried.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.998
Maybe I can shut
 the simulation down
 another way.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.133
No, no, Amanda,
that's a really
good thought,

21:07.166 --> 21:09.068
but you can't do that
 from in here.

21:09.101 --> 21:13.005

 You told me so yourself.

 nothing you're doing
 at the moment

 how I could have
 been so stupid.

Well, now, that's one thing
 you're not.

 just a glitch.

21:40.199 --> 21:42.001
I'll be fine. You go.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.112
Ginn! Ginn!

21:53.145 --> 21:55.482
BRODY: Eli!
 She's in the ship's memory.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.950
It's not like
she can hear you any better
or worse out there.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.352
Then why isn't
 she answering me?

21:59.386 --> 22:01.120
Why are you so sure
 she can help us?

22:01.153 --> 22:03.390
ELI: I think I know
 what Rush is doing.

22:03.423 --> 22:06.393
Because Ginn and I
 had the same idea,
 and I think they talk.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.294
What?
 In their Ascension research,

22:08.327 --> 22:10.196
the Ancients experimented

22:10.229 --> 22:11.731
with the transfer
 of human consciousness
 all the time.

22:11.764 --> 22:12.632
I mean, it's how
the stones work, right?

22:12.665 --> 22:13.733
We have no clue.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.702
CHLOE: Why would he do that?

22:18.571 --> 22:20.607
Okay, so this is a little...
 (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

22:23.610 --> 22:27.313
Night before last,
 Ginn was visiting me
 in my quarters.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.717
We were talking,
 and I said something like,

22:30.750 --> 22:32.752
"Wouldn't it be great
 if we could do
 more than talk?"

22:32.785 --> 22:34.253
You mean actual
 physical contact.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.455
Yeah.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.491
Oh, you mean...

22:38.525 --> 22:40.427
Yes, yes,
 that's what I meant.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.095
Honestly, I was
 just thinking out loud,

22:43.129 --> 22:45.331
but the suggestion
 did not go over well.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.066
BRODY: Well, Eli,
 she just died

22:47.099 --> 22:49.268
and had her
 consciousness uploaded
 to the ship's memory,

22:49.301 --> 22:50.503
and you're just thinking
 about getting your...

22:50.537 --> 22:53.606
What? No! No, no, no, no.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.641
That part she was all for.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.710
Then why?

23:00.813 --> 23:02.281
Because she said
 it would be dangerous.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.717
Why?

23:04.751 --> 23:07.454
You don't think uploading
 a human consciousness
 and back again

23:07.487 --> 23:09.422
is a little dangerous?

23:14.561 --> 23:19.599
When I tried to talk
her into it anyway,
she got mad, or depressed,

23:19.632 --> 23:23.002
or some combination
 of the two, and I haven't
 seen her since.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.774
I'm sure the discoveries
 we make will be

23:27.807 --> 23:29.609
of great benefit
 to both of our worlds.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.411
Well, the ambassador and I
 couldn't agree more.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.481
ADMINISTRATOR:
 We're happy to help
 in any way we can.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.549
Our people will be
dialing in momentarily.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.784
ADMINISTRATOR: Of course.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.588
We have agreed

23:41.621 --> 23:47.326
to attempt dialing
the Stargate's nine chevron
address immediately.

23:47.359 --> 23:51.063
This will be done
 to prove the viability

23:51.097 --> 23:54.100
and the safety
 of such a connection

23:54.133 --> 23:57.470
so that we will be able
 to provide ongoing support
 to their people

23:58.437 --> 24:00.673
on the other side.

24:00.707 --> 24:05.044
Now, I am confident that
 there is no danger. Captain?

24:07.514 --> 24:10.249
A team from Earth
 will be arriving shortly.

24:10.282 --> 24:14.086
We will give them
 our complete support
 and cooperation.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.855
Stow your weapons.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.124
These people are allies.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.593
Dismissed!

24:20.627 --> 24:21.494
Captain, what's going on?

24:24.697 --> 24:27.366
Well, I overheard them.
 They've offered to share
 in everything.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.769
Information, technology...

24:29.802 --> 24:31.704
The administrator said
 drawing that much power
 could overload the core,

24:31.738 --> 24:32.872
rip open
the planet's crust.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.373
Yeah, he's good.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.642
What?

24:36.576 --> 24:38.344
He was bargaining.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.685
PERRY: I'm sorry
 I was gone so long.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.487
I've been having quite
 the existential time
 of it, actually.

24:48.521 --> 24:49.856
Trying to perceive
 the difference

24:49.889 --> 24:52.391
between this place
and the real world,

24:52.424 --> 24:54.861
and if there is one,
 well, I haven't found it.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.532
So you'll still
 come back, then?

24:59.566 --> 25:01.167
Well, I have
 to go away first
 in order to come back.

25:02.401 --> 25:03.770
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem anymore.

25:04.436 --> 25:05.738
Never a doubt.

25:07.373 --> 25:08.775
What was the problem?

25:10.209 --> 25:13.345
Actually,
 (SIGHS) it was Ginn.

25:13.379 --> 25:16.583
Ginn? What has she got
 to do with this, then?

25:16.616 --> 25:19.719
I don't think
 she approves of this.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.488
None of her
 bloody business.
 I know.

25:22.521 --> 25:26.225
But somehow her disapproval
 manifested itself
 in keeping you here.

25:28.928 --> 25:33.265
Colonel Telford,
gentlemen, welcome.

25:33.299 --> 25:34.500
McKay.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.768
Dr. Rodney McKay.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.140
Right.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.244
With your permission,
 Administrator,
 we'll get started.

25:45.277 --> 25:48.447
The facility is
 at your disposal.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.617
McKay, put us to work.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.685
Right, you and your team
 check to make sure
 the power relays

25:52.719 --> 25:55.187
are still
connected to the Stargate
while I hook up

25:55.221 --> 25:57.389
their woefully
antiquated excuse
for a mainframe.

26:02.461 --> 26:04.731
I want somebody
 on every entrance
 of this building.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.298
It's a big building, sir.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.735
Well, use their own people
 if you have to.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.808
RUSH: Should we have
 another go, then?

26:29.656 --> 26:30.790
Bye.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.591
We'll see.

26:48.507 --> 26:49.776
He's back, he's back!

26:49.809 --> 26:51.577
There's no need to shout.
 They can see me.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.345
What the hell
 were you thinking?

26:53.379 --> 26:55.281
I thinking I'm rather hungry.
 How long have I been away?

26:55.314 --> 26:56.716
Almost 12 hours.

26:57.549 --> 26:58.985
That seems about right.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.586
If you're going to do
 something like this,

27:00.619 --> 27:01.654
you should tell someone.

27:01.688 --> 27:02.588
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.023
ELI: Young is pretty pissed!

27:04.056 --> 27:04.957
Yeah, well,
 he can shout at me later.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.326
ELI: How could you be
 so blase about this?

27:07.359 --> 27:08.828
You could have
 died in there.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.863
You can shout at me
 on the way to the mess
 if you like.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.337
I don't believe it.

27:18.370 --> 27:19.706
Amanda said
 it was some kind of

27:19.739 --> 27:21.974
subconscious act
of disapproval.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.810
Ginn would never
 hurt anyone.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.812
It doesn't matter anyway.
 I'm back.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.414
What was it like?

27:36.055 --> 27:38.858
(SOFTLY) Entirely personal.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.398
We're not going to be
 able to keep up this
 charade forever.

27:46.432 --> 27:47.834
How long
 is this gonna take?

27:47.867 --> 27:50.002
I gave you my best guess
 in the briefing.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.371
YOUNG: You also
 said you'd reassess
 once we got here.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.472
Well, the facility
 is already drawing power
 from the naquadria core,

27:53.505 --> 27:55.474
which speeds
things up considerably.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.643
On the other hand,
 this is more or less
 1940s technology,

27:57.676 --> 27:59.879
which can slow things down.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.981
Then again, there's the
 "They don't build things
 like they used to" factor.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.916
One hour or two, McKay.
Which is it?

28:03.950 --> 28:08.054
If we end this conversation
 right now, I can still
 manage the former.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.756
Sheppard's right.

28:09.789 --> 28:10.790
About what?

28:17.429 --> 28:18.731
Perhaps now
 would be a good time

28:18.765 --> 28:20.933
to undertake our
 secondary objective.

28:20.967 --> 28:23.803
YOUNG: By all means.
I'll show you to my office.

29:03.009 --> 29:06.078
How can you possibly
control the power flow
from so small a device?

29:06.112 --> 29:07.980
Because,
 technically speaking,
 as far as you're concerned,

29:08.014 --> 29:09.949
I'm from the future.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.650
Dr. McKay
 appreciates your help.

29:15.687 --> 29:16.789
What is it with genius
 and social skills?

29:16.823 --> 29:18.891
Hmm?

29:18.925 --> 29:21.460
Never mind.
 We're good to go as far as
 the Stargate is concerned.

29:21.493 --> 29:24.897
Good, good.
 Just loading the program,
 so 10 minutes, tops.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.432
I'll just come
 right out and ask.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.467
Once we've proven
 we can do this,

29:28.500 --> 29:31.570
would you be interested
 in joining Destiny's crew?

29:31.603 --> 29:33.072
Well, I never actually...

29:33.105 --> 29:34.673
I know that you
 can pretty much write
 your own ticket

29:34.706 --> 29:36.575
as far as assignments
 are concerned,

29:36.608 --> 29:38.610
but there isn't
 a more exciting mission
 out there.

29:38.644 --> 29:41.013
Well, there is
 the niggling issue of not
 being able to get home.

29:41.047 --> 29:44.150
Not yet, but we get
 the right people aboard,

29:44.183 --> 29:45.818
return Destiny
 to its former glory...

29:45.852 --> 29:46.685
If that's even possible.

29:46.718 --> 29:47.786
That why I need you.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.858
I thought Colonel Young
was in command.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.963
Let me rephrase.
 That's why we need you.

30:05.637 --> 30:06.638
(WHOOSHING)

30:07.974 --> 30:09.942
Mandy!

30:09.976 --> 30:10.910
I just wanted to make sure
 you got back all right.

30:12.078 --> 30:14.546
Home again.
I'm glad.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.515
I was worried.
 I know you were.

30:16.548 --> 30:19.651
The last thing
I would ever want is...

30:21.687 --> 30:22.754
(WHOOSHING)

30:26.592 --> 30:28.194
What the hell was that?

30:28.227 --> 30:29.761
GINN: An emergency shutdown
of the FTL drive.

30:31.730 --> 30:32.999
Ginn!

30:33.032 --> 30:33.732
I don't think there
will be any damage,

30:33.765 --> 30:34.833
but I needed
 the distraction.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.170
Dr. Rush is in danger.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.705
I know, we've been trying
 to get him out,

30:39.738 --> 30:41.040
and I've been
 looking for you.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.177
It was a mistake.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.079
She didn't
 do it intentionally,

30:47.113 --> 30:48.814
but there's no way
 out of the simulation.

30:48.847 --> 30:49.848
Who are we talking about?

30:50.249 --> 30:52.218
Dr. Perry.

30:52.251 --> 30:55.187
I tried to reach
 out to you sooner,
 but she keeps stopping me,

30:55.221 --> 30:57.523
or suppressing me.

30:57.556 --> 30:58.991
It's hard to explain.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.493
It's taking
 all of my concentration
 just to be here.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.761
Why would she do that?

31:02.794 --> 31:04.663
She's trying to buy time
 to solve the problem

31:04.696 --> 31:08.234
in her initial programming
 of the simulation,
 but she can't.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.036
The only way to end this
 is from the outside.

31:12.704 --> 31:13.739
You have to do it, Eli.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.676
How?

31:17.709 --> 31:18.644
You have to...

31:19.311 --> 31:22.982
Ginn! Ginn...

31:31.223 --> 31:32.791
Hey, what happened?

31:32.824 --> 31:34.293
I sensed
 a potential overload

31:34.326 --> 31:36.762
in one of the FTL
 drive modules.

31:36.795 --> 31:38.897
I was able
to stop it with an
emergency shutdown.

31:38.931 --> 31:39.932
Very good.

31:41.767 --> 31:44.971
So, should I leave you
 to your work

31:45.004 --> 31:46.939
or can we sit
 and talk a while?

31:46.973 --> 31:49.175
Well, I should work, really.

31:51.810 --> 31:53.512
I'll see you soon.
 Sure.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.528
(WOOLSEY CLEARS THROAT)

32:12.031 --> 32:13.832
We have a problem.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.234
You couldn't find proof?

32:15.267 --> 32:16.935
Oh, I found proof,
 all right.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.070
That for the past
 several months,

32:18.104 --> 32:20.306
the Langarans have
steadfastly refused

32:20.339 --> 32:22.674
to have anything to do
 with the Lucian Alliance.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.676
It doesn't take
 that long to say "no."

32:24.710 --> 32:27.679
In each exchange
 they've been offered more,
 much more,

32:27.713 --> 32:30.282
and each time they refused,
apparently out of concern

32:30.316 --> 32:33.785
for jeopardizing
their alliance with us.
I told you...

32:33.819 --> 32:35.287
Woolsey, we had
 damn good reason
 to suspect...

32:35.321 --> 32:37.689
Yes, because of our
spy satellites.

32:39.858 --> 32:41.693
This changes nothing.

 were still in the neural

33:53.699 --> 33:56.068
Why are you doing this?

33:56.102 --> 33:58.404
Because I haven't
 left the simulation yet,
 have I?

33:58.437 --> 34:00.106
It's time for me to
 find a way out myself.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.407
This isn't the way...

34:01.440 --> 34:03.909
Look, all simulations
 require parameters,

34:03.942 --> 34:05.377
conditions beyond which
the programmed scenario

34:05.411 --> 34:07.113
can no longer continue.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.848
If this doesn't stop it,
 I don't know what will.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.016
No, Nick,
 this is really happening.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.152
You're going to kill
 everyone on this ship.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.788
I don't think so.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.225
(LOUD RUMBLING)

34:45.117 --> 34:48.387
David, we need to reconsider
 what we're doing.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.121
"Better to beg forgiveness
 than ask for permission."

34:50.156 --> 34:51.089
That's what my dad
 used to always say.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.791
That only made sense
 when we could achieve

34:52.824 --> 34:54.493
the dial-out
 before we got caught.

34:54.525 --> 34:55.327
We still can.

34:56.995 --> 34:59.131
McKay, what are
you waiting for?

34:59.165 --> 35:02.434
The program is running.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.802
(POWERING UP)

35:07.038 --> 35:09.908
Listen to me, Everett,
 I need to get back there,
 and you need supplies.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.077
Sir, there's a sizable force
 gathering outside
 the building.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.044
Chevron one is encoded.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.317
YOUNG: If I could have
 your attention, please!

35:18.350 --> 35:19.785
For safety reasons,

35:19.818 --> 35:22.188
I need all
Langaran personnel

35:22.221 --> 35:24.790
to leave
 this room immediately.
 Thank you.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.358
WOOLSEY: There's no time.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.160
We should stop now
 and dial Earth.

35:28.194 --> 35:29.961
No! We can't quit now,
 not when we're this close.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.498
This will be
 a diplomatic disaster.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.466
I give a damn
 about those people
 on that ship,

35:34.500 --> 35:36.302
I make no apologies
 for that.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.504
If we stop now,
 we give up any chance
 of helping them!

35:38.537 --> 35:41.006
And if we don't stop,
 people will get hurt, David.

35:41.039 --> 35:43.209
We've got two
 trained SG units,
 plus you and me.

35:43.242 --> 35:44.343
All we need to do
 is hold them off

35:44.376 --> 35:45.211
until we can
 make a connection.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.949
Chevron two encoded!

35:50.982 --> 35:52.951
Then what?
TELFORD: We stand down.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.486
We explain what happened,
 the whole thing,

35:54.520 --> 35:56.488
but at least we will
 have proven to them
 that it works.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.357
Chevron three encoded!

35:58.390 --> 35:59.825
(CLANGING)

35:59.858 --> 36:00.859
Sir?

36:03.028 --> 36:04.129
Do not fire!

36:04.162 --> 36:08.867
I repeat, do not fire
 unless fired upon!

36:08.900 --> 36:11.069
Everett, I do not
 want to hurt anyone
 any more than you do,

36:11.102 --> 36:12.170
but we've only got
 one shot at this.

36:12.204 --> 36:13.239
You want to
get back that bad?

36:13.272 --> 36:14.906
TELFORD: Not just
 for my sake.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.408
This place can be
 Destiny lifeline.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.810
McKAY: Chevron four encoded.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.312
We know what
 you're attempting to do,

36:20.346 --> 36:22.013
and it will not
 be tolerated!

36:22.047 --> 36:23.382
Ambassador,
 the Earth's delegation

36:23.415 --> 36:26.184
has convinced me that
 there is no danger.

36:26.218 --> 36:28.254
OVIRDA: I don't know
 who you are,

36:28.287 --> 36:30.356
but Administrator Halpurn
 would never agree to this.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.058
Chevron five encoded!

36:33.091 --> 36:34.526
Our forces have
 been instructed
 to open fire

36:34.560 --> 36:37.529
if the dialing process
reaches the eighth chevron.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.898
We just want to prove
 to you that it can be done,
 that's all!

36:39.931 --> 36:41.132
The choice is yours.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.074
YOUNG: Power levels?

36:49.107 --> 36:50.409
McKAY: Well within
 my predictions.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.010
So it would have worked?
 Absolutely.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.612
Chevron six is locked,
 by the way,

36:53.645 --> 36:55.180
and I would not
 be standing there.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.416
They won't shoot.

36:57.449 --> 37:00.852
Colonel, look, I may just
 be the brilliant scientist

37:00.886 --> 37:02.954
relegated to
 shouting out the obvious
 in terms of chevrons here,

37:02.988 --> 37:05.056
but while I'm stating
 the obvious,

37:05.090 --> 37:07.893
this mission is
 already a failure.

37:07.926 --> 37:08.927
It's only going
 to get worse.

37:15.667 --> 37:16.835
Thank you.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.408
Shut it down.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.145
(STARGATE POWERING DOWN)

37:36.988 --> 37:38.223
ELI: There's no way
 to shut down the simulation.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.491
CHLOE: Why not?
 Because Perry's the one

37:39.525 --> 37:40.959
who programmed
 the parameters.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.061
Unconsciously or not,
 she's keeping him there.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.496
So what are we doing?
 Ginn told me

37:44.530 --> 37:47.333
the only way to do
 it's from the outside.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.001
Dr. Perry pulled her away
 from me before she got
 the words out,

37:50.035 --> 37:52.638
but I'm pretty sure I know
 what she was gonna say.

38:00.312 --> 38:01.347
Why did you do that, Nick?

38:03.214 --> 38:04.383
To prove that
 it wasn't real.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.487
Why did you lie to me?

38:08.520 --> 38:09.988
I thought it was
 some kind of glitch.

38:10.021 --> 38:13.024
I thought it was something
 that I could repair.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.627
They could just
 keep your body alive
 while I found a way.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.195
You wouldn't have to worry.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.098
So what do we do?

38:20.131 --> 38:24.703
It's out of my hands now.
 Ginn finally got through
 to Eli.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.338
It was never
 her fault, was it?

38:28.239 --> 38:29.040
No.

38:30.576 --> 38:32.478
It was an innocent mistake

38:32.511 --> 38:34.613
in programming
 the parameters
 of the simulation.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.048
It was so simple that
nothing could go wrong.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.684
What were the parameters?

38:38.717 --> 38:40.018
I don't blame you.

38:40.051 --> 38:40.686
For what?

38:43.422 --> 38:46.958
Amanda, what were they?

38:46.992 --> 38:48.360
That we love each other.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.030
That's all.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.234
That was the only thing
that needed to happen,

38:56.267 --> 38:59.638
and then you could
 have come and gone
 as you wished.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.373
I love you, Nick.

39:02.574 --> 39:03.575
But you don't...
 No!

39:03.609 --> 39:07.012
No, no, of course I do.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.414
That can't be the problem.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.248
It's not something
 you can will to be true.

39:10.281 --> 39:11.282
But it is true.

39:13.519 --> 39:14.520
I love you.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.656
This wasn't fair
to you to begin with.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.358
I've felt this way about you
 for most of my life.

39:20.392 --> 39:24.029
No, no. Amanda,
 please listen to me,
 here, now.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.765
I mean, not the verdict
 of some bloody program.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.333
You don't have much time.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.601
Eli has

39:29.635 --> 39:31.069
already started
deleting the memory

39:31.102 --> 39:32.203
where our consciousness
is stored.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.073
You and Ginn?

39:35.106 --> 39:36.107
It's the
 strangest feeling...

39:36.141 --> 39:37.676
Well, stop him!
 I can't.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.611
No, try! Protect yourself!

39:39.645 --> 39:44.416
I know you blame yourself
 for my death,
 but don't. Okay?

39:47.118 --> 39:48.353
Because if that
 hadn't happened,

39:48.386 --> 39:49.755
then I never
 would have felt this.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.494
I do love you.
 I swear it.

39:59.264 --> 40:00.466
Goodbye.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.608
(SOBBING)

40:17.248 --> 40:18.316
Is that you?

40:18.349 --> 40:19.250
(EXHALES)

40:20.652 --> 40:22.287
Yeah, it's us.
YOUNG: Yeah.

40:23.489 --> 40:24.790
How'd the mission go?

40:24.823 --> 40:26.825
They've agreed
 to release our people

40:26.858 --> 40:30.061
in exchange for
 the defense of their planet
 from the Lucian Alliance,

40:30.095 --> 40:32.631
also the removal
 of the Stargate from their
 power facility.

40:32.664 --> 40:36.568
So, mission not accomplished.

40:36.602 --> 40:37.669
Speaking of letting
 prisoners free...
 JAMES: Oh.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.339
They seemed decent enough.

40:41.372 --> 40:43.675
I didn't think there'd
be harm in showing them
the ship and crew

40:43.709 --> 40:45.677
that they were
trying to help.

40:45.711 --> 40:47.813
I hope that was all right.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.080
Lieutenant,
in the grand scheme
of things,

40:49.114 --> 40:53.184
I think that was
the best decision any of us
has made all day.

40:55.521 --> 40:56.822
(GASPS)

41:00.726 --> 41:04.796
What happened?
How did I get here?

41:04.830 --> 41:06.464
You've actually been back
 for a couple of days.

41:06.498 --> 41:09.568
It just took you that long
 to come out of the coma.

41:12.571 --> 41:15.541
Eli, what the hell
 did you do?

41:15.574 --> 41:18.677
What the hell did I do?

41:18.710 --> 41:23.214
I transferred the memory
 where they were stored
 into quarantine.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.684
They're cut off
 from the rest of
 the ship now, and us.

41:27.352 --> 41:28.887
They?
There was no other way.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.823
That's what Ginn said,
 so that's what I did.

41:34.392 --> 41:35.426
To save you.

41:39.865 --> 41:41.533
No, Eli!

41:41.567 --> 41:42.768
Forget it.

41:45.771 --> 41:47.438
You need to rest.

41:49.775 --> 41:51.843
In fact, you're lucky
 to be alive.

41:53.779 --> 41:55.547
GREER: Listen to her, Doc.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.684
She knows what
 she's talking about.
