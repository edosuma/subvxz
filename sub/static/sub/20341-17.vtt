01:09.208 --> 01:10.583
And it's about
to get even better.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.000

01:13.208 --> 01:15.958
Pumpkin patch,
here we come.

01:15.958 --> 01:17.166
Pumpkin patch?

01:17.166 --> 01:18.583
What?

01:18.583 --> 01:20.583
If you guys think
this is fun,

01:20.583 --> 01:23.333
wait until you see

01:23.333 --> 01:24.750
Oh, that's right.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.583

a way out,

03:04.416 --> 03:06.583
then we'll just have
to make one.

03:06.583 --> 03:08.125
Come on, Rolly.

03:08.125 --> 03:09.125
(grunts)

03:10.291 --> 03:12.375
I think I need some Rolly power.

(laughs)
What is it?

03:25.583 --> 03:28.125
I love it! (laughs)

03:28.125 --> 03:30.125
Pretty spooky, isn't he?

03:30.125 --> 03:31.583
I'm pretty proud of him.

03:31.583 --> 03:35.000
I added a few spooky touches
to Farmer Dell's scarecrow here.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.375
I'm Charlie.

03:36.375 --> 03:39.250
I'm officially the unofficial
pumpkin patch crow.

03:39.250 --> 03:42.166
Hi! I'm Rolly, and this is
my brother Bingo.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.291
Tell me, if you had
to rate this scarecrow

03:44.291 --> 03:46.750
on a scale of
totally-Halloween-spooky

03:46.750 --> 03:49.958
to not-spooky-at-all,
how would it do?

03:49.958 --> 03:52.375
Hmm. Well,
not-spooky-at-all.

03:52.375 --> 03:54.458
I'd call it
totally-Halloween-silly.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.875
(laughing)

03:56.875 --> 03:59.708
I was really going for
totally-Halloween-spooky.

03:59.708 --> 04:02.500
But we love silly things.
Right, Rolly?

04:02.500 --> 04:05.250
More than you'll ever know.

04:05.250 --> 04:07.000
Why do you want
a scary scarecrow anyway?

04:07.000 --> 04:10.458
As the official-unofficial
pumpkin patch crow,

04:10.458 --> 04:14.125
it's my Halloween duty
to up the spook factor.

04:14.125 --> 04:17.333
Well, you certainly upped
the silly factor.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.250
You should call them
silly-crows.

04:19.250 --> 04:22.458
Bob:
Bingo! Rolly!
Time to go home!

04:22.458 --> 04:25.166
We'd better go.
See you later, Charlie.

04:26.125 --> 04:28.625
Good luck tryin' to up
your spook factor, Charlie.

04:28.625 --> 04:29.875
(giggling)

04:29.875 --> 04:32.000
-So silly.
-Thanks for the feedback.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.625
How to make you spooky... hmm.

04:36.125 --> 04:37.333
(barking)

04:37.333 --> 04:38.958
Whoa! Careful there, fellas!

04:38.958 --> 04:41.750
Let me set these pumpkins down.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.875
Oh, I can't wait
to carve these.

04:43.875 --> 04:46.375
(gasps) But first,
I have to go pick up treats

04:46.375 --> 04:48.958
for all the trick-or-treaters
we'll be getting tomorrow.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.000
You missed a great time
at the pumpkin patch, Hissy.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
We raced all around
the pumpkins and a corn maze,

04:57.000 --> 04:58.583
and we saw scarecrows.

04:58.583 --> 05:01.583
Except that I think the hay
from the hayride made me itchy.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.208
Oh, yeah.

05:04.208 --> 05:06.250
That feels much better.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.875
My collar is missing.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.333
Where'd it go?

05:10.333 --> 05:12.375
You had your collar with you
at the pumpkin patch.

05:12.375 --> 05:13.875
Do you see it anywhere?

05:13.875 --> 05:15.291
Um...

05:15.291 --> 05:17.166
(gasps)
I think I see it!

05:18.958 --> 05:21.250
Nope. It's just my tail.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.625
Looks nothin' like a collar.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.125
Silly Rolly.

05:24.125 --> 05:27.250
Bob made that collar for me
and I lost it.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.000
You love that collar, I know.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.708
-(whimpers)
-Hey! Maybe since
you were racing

05:31.708 --> 05:34.333
all around the pumpkin patch,
you lost it there.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.208
(gasps)
Good idea, Hissy.

05:36.208 --> 05:38.875
-Idea?
-Bingo, you know
what this means?

05:38.875 --> 05:41.083
It means, I'm calling
the mission today.

05:41.083 --> 05:43.458
We're going to find your lost
collar at the pumpkin patch.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.583

(laughs) Yeah.

06:31.583 --> 06:34.000
But it's a little darker here
than I thought it would be.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.208
I got this!

06:35.208 --> 06:37.125
-Oh, good thinking.
-It is, isn't it?

06:37.125 --> 06:39.000
Let's search the area.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.291
Starting where we went
this afternoon. Come on.

06:42.958 --> 06:46.125
This place is pretty dark
and spooky.

06:46.125 --> 06:47.500
(shudders, shrieks)

06:50.625 --> 06:52.166
It's okay, Hissy.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.750
Yeah, they're just
silly scarecrows.

06:54.750 --> 06:58.583
Right. Scarecrows.
Of course. I knew that.

06:58.583 --> 07:01.083
Let's keep looking
for your collar.

07:01.083 --> 07:04.250
-Well, it's not around here.
-Where did we go next?

07:04.250 --> 07:06.125
I think it was...

07:06.125 --> 07:07.583
(gasps) Oh!
This way!

07:09.958 --> 07:13.000
Who knew a pumpkin patch
would have so many spooky--

07:13.000 --> 07:14.166
Eek!

07:14.166 --> 07:15.166
What are those?

07:16.875 --> 07:18.875
Those are just
jack-o'-lanterns.

07:18.875 --> 07:22.583
Yeah. Farmer Dell gave
them really silly faces. See?

07:27.000 --> 07:30.708
Yep. Those are
just a barrel of laughs.

07:30.708 --> 07:33.125
Mmm, no collar
here, either.

07:33.125 --> 07:35.083
Come on. We went
to the corn maze next.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.208
Bingo: Oh, yeah. This is
super hard to get out of.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.708
We got lost
the first time.

07:40.708 --> 07:42.125
Lost, you said?

07:42.125 --> 07:44.250
(gulps) You know what?

07:44.250 --> 07:46.000
How about you go
look in there,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.750
and I go look
somewhere less maze-y

07:48.750 --> 07:51.583
and more, heh...
well-lit?

07:51.583 --> 07:53.875
Great idea, Hissy.

07:56.583 --> 07:59.416
Where did that crazy collar go?

07:59.416 --> 08:02.125
Aah! Giant, giant pumpkin!

08:02.125 --> 08:04.125
(shrieks)

08:04.125 --> 08:06.750
Well, at least I don't have
to look at it anymore.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.583
-(rumbling)
-Of course.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.250
(screams)

08:11.333 --> 08:13.166
(Charlie caws)

08:13.166 --> 08:16.000
Well, that's certainly
something you don't see
every day.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.875
(cawing)

08:20.750 --> 08:22.208
No collar, but hey!

08:22.208 --> 08:24.083
We found our way out
of the maze this time.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.833
High paw!

08:25.833 --> 08:28.875
We looked everywhere
and we still didn't find
my collar.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.000
Don't worry, Bingo.

08:31.166 --> 08:33.416
We'll find it.
It's a Rolly guarantee.

08:33.416 --> 08:36.250
(chuckles)
Thanks, Rolly.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.875
Wait! Rolly?

08:37.875 --> 08:40.291
We didn't find our way
out of the maze earlier.

08:40.291 --> 08:42.000
We Rolly-powered
our way out.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Oh, yeah! That was fun.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.291
Maybe my collar fell off
when we pushed through
the maze wall!

08:47.291 --> 08:48.250
Let's go check it out.

08:52.625 --> 08:56.291
I'm pretty sure we made our way
out of the maze somewhere
around here.

08:56.291 --> 08:58.000
Charlie (caws):
Hey there, fellas!

08:58.000 --> 08:59.500
Hey, Charlie!

08:59.500 --> 09:02.083
I'm gettin' to see all kinds
of fun things tonight.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.958
Puppies running around the farm,

09:03.958 --> 09:06.250
and scared cats running
from rolling pumpkins.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.250
Scared cats?
Uh-oh.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.500
Come on, Rolly.
My collar can wait.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.208
Hissy needs us.

09:12.208 --> 09:14.208
(screaming)

09:18.875 --> 09:21.166
Whew! That was a close call.

09:21.166 --> 09:24.125
Bingo? Rolly?
Are you guys in here?

09:25.125 --> 09:26.875
Hissy! We're here to help you--

09:26.875 --> 09:28.708
(shrieks) A giant pumpkin!

09:28.708 --> 09:30.875
Don't worry, brothers!
I'm comin'!

09:30.875 --> 09:32.000
(grunts)

09:32.000 --> 09:33.208
I'm comin'!

09:35.125 --> 09:36.208
(panting)

09:36.208 --> 09:38.000
I had a dream
like this once!

09:38.000 --> 09:39.375
(panting)

09:39.375 --> 09:41.375
Did the dream end
with us getting squashed?

09:46.833 --> 09:47.875
We're trapped!

09:47.875 --> 09:49.166
Take my paw!

09:51.166 --> 09:52.625
(grunting)

09:52.625 --> 09:54.458
Whoa!

09:54.458 --> 09:55.833
(grunts)

09:55.833 --> 09:57.750
Wow. Thanks, Hissy.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.750
You're my little brothers!

09:59.750 --> 10:02.250
I'll do whatever it
takes to help you.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.416
(gasps)

10:03.416 --> 10:05.250
(stutters) Scary!

10:07.208 --> 10:09.291
Get back, you spooky monster!

10:09.291 --> 10:10.375
Wait a minute!

10:10.375 --> 10:12.875
Hissy, that's not
a spooky monster.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.625
That's one
of the silly
scarecrows.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.875
Then, what's causing
that spooky light
under his face?

10:19.708 --> 10:21.083
My collar!

10:21.083 --> 10:23.625
Now we just have
to get it down!

10:23.625 --> 10:25.000
Leave it to me, pups!

10:25.000 --> 10:26.708
(grunting)

10:29.500 --> 10:31.416
-(Charlie caws)
-Hey!

10:31.416 --> 10:33.125
This is mine.

10:33.125 --> 10:35.625
I need it to make the scarecrow
spooky for Halloween.

10:35.625 --> 10:38.500
It's actually
my little brother's collar.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.125
Yeah! Bingo lost it
earlier today.

10:41.125 --> 10:43.083
I'd really like
to have it back, please.

10:43.083 --> 10:46.083
That explains why I suddenly
found a really cool collar

10:46.083 --> 10:48.291
on the ground by the maze
after you left.

10:48.291 --> 10:51.125
Sorry. I didn't realize
it was yours.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.291
Thanks, Charlie.

10:54.291 --> 10:57.291
I'm sorry you couldn't use it
to up your spook factor.

10:57.291 --> 10:59.708
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm going to do now.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.750
(giggling)

11:06.000 --> 11:08.458
You're right!
This scarecrow is silly.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.625
So silly,
that I kind of love it.

11:12.583 --> 11:14.750
He's spooky silly!

11:14.750 --> 11:17.083
(laughing)

11:17.083 --> 11:18.875
Uh...
He is pretty silly.

11:18.875 --> 11:21.291
You're really good
at making silly things, Charlie.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.500
I am, aren't I?

11:22.500 --> 11:26.833
Well, then,
as the official-unofficial crow
of this pumpkin patch,

11:26.833 --> 11:31.000
I've decided it's now
my duty to up the silly factor.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.875
(giggling)
And now he's got
a silly mustache.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.875
(laughing)

11:39.750 --> 11:42.416
Ooh, I can't wait!
Can you see anything?

11:42.416 --> 11:44.875
No! The suspense is
too much!

11:44.875 --> 11:47.000
Be patient, guys.
He'll be finished soon.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.458
Just gotta
get this light
in there and...

11:50.458 --> 11:52.000
Voila!

11:52.000 --> 11:54.416
We are ready
for Halloween!

11:54.416 --> 11:56.958
-That's us!
-We look great!

11:56.958 --> 11:58.583
-(barking)
-Come on, guys!

11:58.583 --> 12:01.125
I'm gonna put
them outside
for people to see.

12:01.125 --> 12:03.458
Thanks for helpin' me
get my collar back, guys.

12:03.458 --> 12:06.166
You're our brother.
We've got your back.

12:06.166 --> 12:08.166
And I've almost got
my tail!

12:08.166 --> 12:09.458
Whoa-uh!

12:09.458 --> 12:12.000
(laughing)

12:12.000 --> 12:14.166
(laughing continuing)

12:17.291 --> 12:20.083
(Bingo/Rolly speak)

12:20.083 --> 12:21.750
Great gears!

12:21.750 --> 12:23.416
This wind is strong!

12:23.416 --> 12:25.208
Oh! Wow!

12:26.375 --> 12:27.458
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

12:27.458 --> 12:29.708
Whoa!
Hi, Bob!

12:31.125 --> 12:33.083
Uh, where are you, Bingo?

12:33.083 --> 12:35.208
Happy Halloween!

12:35.208 --> 12:37.583
(laughs)
You spooked me, Bingo!

12:37.583 --> 12:40.875
-That costume is good!
-Thanks! So is yours!

12:40.875 --> 12:42.333
I'm a pup-kin.
Get it?

12:42.333 --> 12:44.500
It's a puppy
and a pumpkin combined.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.000
And watch this!

12:46.000 --> 12:47.583
(giggles)

12:48.708 --> 12:50.083
(grunts)

12:50.083 --> 12:51.125
Are you stuck?

12:51.125 --> 12:52.291
Yes, yes, I am.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.250
(grunting)

12:56.125 --> 12:58.166
I don't think
it's supposed
to be like this.

12:58.166 --> 13:00.583
Whatever we do, Rufus,

13:00.583 --> 13:04.875
we have to stay away
from the far end
of the park tonight.

13:06.291 --> 13:08.333
Huh?

13:08.333 --> 13:10.708
Hey, Cupcake and Rufus,
why do you have to stay away

13:10.708 --> 13:12.000
from the far end
of the park tonight?

13:12.000 --> 13:16.083
You little puppies are just
gonna be spooked if I tell you.

13:16.083 --> 13:18.083
-No, we won't.
-Well, we might.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.208
If you really wanna know,

13:20.208 --> 13:24.166
every Halloween,
there's a spooky-wooky ghost

13:24.166 --> 13:26.208
called the Haunted Howler

13:26.208 --> 13:29.708
that haunts
the far end of the park.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.125
Spooky and wooky?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.708
Ooh!

13:35.458 --> 13:38.000
And the Haunted Howler wants

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
everybody to stay away,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.083
so he howls,
like this...

13:43.083 --> 13:45.458
(howls)

13:47.000 --> 13:48.208
Aw, that's really cute!

13:48.208 --> 13:51.750
It's not supposed to be cute!

13:51.750 --> 13:55.208
It's supposed to sound
more like a... (inhales)

13:55.208 --> 13:57.458
-(howling)
-(giggling)

13:57.458 --> 13:59.083
But spookier!

13:59.083 --> 14:02.500
Even if it is cute,
I still don't want to meet
a howly ghost.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.291
(mumbling)
Me neither!

14:04.291 --> 14:06.833
Come on, Rufus.
Let's go!

14:06.833 --> 14:10.125
Don't worry, Rolly.
Cupcake just made that story up.

14:10.125 --> 14:12.625
Aw, we're never
gonna find it!

14:12.625 --> 14:14.500
Halloween is ruined!

14:14.500 --> 14:18.291
Uh-oh. Sounds like there's
some trouble next door.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.291
Let's see if they need any help.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.708
Hey! Everything okay over here?

14:26.708 --> 14:30.083
No, Mr. Bob!
We have a costume
emergency!

14:30.083 --> 14:32.875
Chloe made her own
Halloween costume
this year.

14:32.875 --> 14:36.250
And when we hung it outside
to dry, the wind blew it away!

14:36.250 --> 14:40.500
Without my costume,
I don't feel like
trick-or-treating tonight.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.708
-No trick-or-treating?
-That's the best part
of Halloween.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.166
You can share my costume, Chloe.

14:46.166 --> 14:48.208
You can be half-robot.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.125
Be-boop-bop!

14:50.125 --> 14:53.166
(giggles)
Thanks, Stephan.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.375
But I really just wanna
wear the costume I made.

14:55.375 --> 14:58.708
It glowed in the dark
and was all flowy and wiggly.

14:58.708 --> 15:00.708
It does sound like
a cool costume.

15:00.708 --> 15:03.833
Oh, I'm sorry
you lost it, Chloe.

15:03.833 --> 15:06.291
If I see it floating around,
I'll let you know.

15:06.291 --> 15:08.583
-Thanks. Bye, Bob!
-Bye!

15:09.750 --> 15:11.416
(yawns)

15:11.416 --> 15:15.000
All righty, guys!
Woo! I'm gonna take
a little nap

15:15.000 --> 15:17.416
before the trick-or-treaters
start coming.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.375
Everything okay, guys?

15:19.375 --> 15:23.000
We feel bad for Chloe.
She lost her glowy
and flowy costume.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.625
And now she doesn't
wanna go trick-or-treating

15:24.625 --> 15:27.125
anymore, so her
Halloween is ruined.

15:27.125 --> 15:30.750
No trick-or-treating?
That's sad.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.458
Unless we go find
Chloe's costume!

15:33.458 --> 15:35.250
Oh, that's a mission!
That's a mission!

15:35.250 --> 15:36.583
It sure is!

15:36.583 --> 15:38.166
A Halloween mission!

15:38.166 --> 15:40.500
-Come on, Rolly!
-Uh, bye, Hissy!

I don't know!
She never said what
her Halloween costume was!

But we do know her costume
is flowy and glows
in the dark!

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
It's glowy but not flowy.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.458
That's a jack-o'-lantern.

18:20.458 --> 18:22.750
Plus, it's too small
to be her costume.

18:22.750 --> 18:26.291
So, it's not Chloe's costume,
but it kinda looks like mine.

18:26.291 --> 18:28.833
Look!
I'm a Rolly-o'-lantern!

18:28.833 --> 18:31.291
(laughs)
Rolly! Look!

18:31.291 --> 18:32.875
That might be the costume!

18:32.875 --> 18:34.250
It's super flowy!

18:34.250 --> 18:35.583
But not glowy.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.583

-Yep.
-Like that?

18:48.166 --> 18:49.333
Just like that!

18:49.333 --> 18:50.625
After it!

18:50.625 --> 18:52.250
(both panting)

18:55.208 --> 18:57.083
Bingo:
That's gotta be
Chloe's costume.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.583
Then let's get it down!

18:59.583 --> 19:01.291
You know what this calls for!

19:01.291 --> 19:04.958
Say grappling hooks!
Please say grappling hooks!

19:04.958 --> 19:07.166
-Grappling hooks!
-Yes! Called it!

19:11.875 --> 19:13.458
Hooks grappled.

Both:
Whoa!

19:16.208 --> 19:17.083
(giggling)

19:17.083 --> 19:19.458
Let's get this costume down
and bring it to Chloe!

19:26.250 --> 19:27.833
Smooth landing!

19:27.833 --> 19:31.250
There is nothing
that can get his costume
away from us now!

19:31.250 --> 19:32.333
Except that!

19:32.333 --> 19:36.250
It's okay.
We just gotta catch it
before it blows into...

19:36.250 --> 19:38.375
-(gasps)
-The far end of the park!

19:40.166 --> 19:42.166
Huh?

19:44.083 --> 19:45.291
Huh?

19:45.291 --> 19:46.458
Boo!

19:49.625 --> 19:52.208
(howling)

19:52.208 --> 19:54.416
We've gotta follow
that costume!

19:54.416 --> 19:57.583
What about the Haunted Howler
ghost in Cupcake's story?

19:57.583 --> 20:00.000
You know, the far end
of the park?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.291
(Rufus howling)

20:02.291 --> 20:06.375
-Is that a howl-y ghost?
-There's no such thing
as ghosts.

20:06.375 --> 20:09.333
Besides, it's our mission
to get Chloe her costume back!

20:09.333 --> 20:11.166
And that's what
we're gonna do!

20:11.166 --> 20:13.458
-Right, Rolly?
-Yeah, I guess.

20:13.458 --> 20:15.208
That's one option.

20:15.208 --> 20:18.833
Or we could... Yeah,
this is the thing we're doing.

20:18.833 --> 20:20.166
Here we go!

20:27.208 --> 20:29.458
That's the far end
of the park over there.

20:29.458 --> 20:31.208

20:37.500 --> 20:39.083
Both:
Aaah!

20:39.083 --> 20:40.166
-Hey!
-Both:
Aaah!

20:40.166 --> 20:41.458
Sorry to startle you.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.250
I'm just looking for Rufus.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.416
Seen him anywhere? Hmm?

20:44.416 --> 20:46.458
No, but we did hear
the Haunted Howler ghost

20:46.458 --> 20:47.708
from your story.

20:47.708 --> 20:49.250
Over there!

20:49.250 --> 20:51.500
The far end of the park!

20:51.500 --> 20:56.166
Oh, that was just a story
I made up to spook you
for Halloween.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.083
Glad it worked.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.208
Let me know
if you see Rufus.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.750
Rufus, where are you?

21:02.750 --> 21:04.416
That's where the costume went!

21:04.416 --> 21:05.625
So that's where
we have to go!

21:05.625 --> 21:07.083
But what about the ghost?

21:07.083 --> 21:08.625
The Haunted Howler?

21:08.625 --> 21:10.750
Cupcake says
she made the story up.

21:10.750 --> 21:14.250
Besides, together,
there's nothin' to be afraid of.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.875
Ghost!
The Haunted Howler!

21:16.875 --> 21:18.125
Aaaaaah!

21:18.125 --> 21:20.875
The story I made up
to scare you is true!

21:20.875 --> 21:23.208
(Rufus howling)

21:28.166 --> 21:29.958
(Rufus howling)

21:29.958 --> 21:31.083
Wait a second!

21:31.083 --> 21:33.000
That ghost looks a lot
like Chloe's costume!

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
It does kinda.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.250
-(howling)
-I ain't afraid
of no ghost costume!

21:40.708 --> 21:42.250
You're not a ghost!

21:42.250 --> 21:44.250
-You're a Rufus?
-Mm-hm!

21:44.250 --> 21:46.458
(panting)

21:47.875 --> 21:50.125
Hey, you were
really brave, Rolly.

21:50.125 --> 21:52.375
Yeah.
I was still kinda scared.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.166
But you did it anyway.

21:54.166 --> 21:56.166
That's the bravest kinda
brave there is.

21:56.166 --> 21:57.125
Mm-hm.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.625
Children:
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!

21:58.625 --> 22:00.708
Trick or treat!

22:00.708 --> 22:02.875
Oh, no!
Trick-or-treating
is starting!

22:02.875 --> 22:05.291
We'd better get this costume
back to Chloe fast!

22:05.291 --> 22:07.500
But it's hard to fun fast
when you're a pumpkin!

22:07.500 --> 22:09.125
We'll never get there in time!

22:10.125 --> 22:12.458
Don't worry.
I have an idea.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.833
Bingo:
Hold onto the costume!

22:15.833 --> 22:18.208
Rolly:
I'm trying!
It's too windy!

22:19.875 --> 22:21.583
Both:
No!

22:22.750 --> 22:24.375
We were so close!

22:24.375 --> 22:26.708
We'd better tell Chloe
the bad news.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.208
(mumbled) Look!

22:32.875 --> 22:34.500
(gasps) My costume!

22:34.500 --> 22:35.708
It came back!

22:36.708 --> 22:38.708
We did it!
High paw!

22:38.708 --> 22:41.458
We couldn't have done it
without you too, Rufus.

22:41.458 --> 22:43.333
(mumbled)
High paw!

22:46.291 --> 22:47.625
(doorbell rings)

22:49.875 --> 22:51.291
Chloe/Stephan:
Trick or treat!

22:51.291 --> 22:54.833
Ooh!
A spooky ghost
and a cool robot!

22:54.833 --> 22:56.750
And guess what, Mr. Bob?

22:56.750 --> 23:00.125
I'm me!
I found my costume!

23:00.125 --> 23:03.625
You did?
Oh, I'm so glad!

23:03.625 --> 23:05.458
Have a happy Halloween!

23:05.458 --> 23:08.708
I am!
This is the happiest
Halloween ever!

23:08.708 --> 23:10.000
Thank you, Mr. Bob!

23:10.000 --> 23:11.875
-Bye, Bob!
-Thanks!

23:11.875 --> 23:13.083
I think so, too!

23:13.083 --> 23:15.208
-(toy squeaks)
-Whoa!

23:17.458 --> 23:21.000
-You stuck?
-(both laugh)

23:21.000 --> 23:22.250
You know it!

23:22.250 --> 23:23.708
Happy Halloween, brother!

23:23.708 --> 23:25.750
Happy Halloween, Bingo!

23:25.750 --> 23:28.583
(both laughing)

23:32.708 --> 23:34.166
(theme music playing)

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Both:
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:41.291 --> 23:42.333
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:43.458 --> 23:46.125
(record scratching)

23:52.500 --> 23:53.500
Bark!

23:57.166 --> 23:58.375
Bark! Bark! Bark!
