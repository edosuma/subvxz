WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:05.406
Hi, Mommy.

00:05.439 --> 00:06.807
Today, my friend Zack

00:06.840 --> 00:08.909
tried to drink
a large apple juice.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.844
It didn't end well.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.213
He peed himself.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.215
How close were you?
Do we need to burn your shoes?

00:14.248 --> 00:15.316
(scoffs)

00:15.349 --> 00:17.085
Good.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.152
Look what I got you.

00:18.186 --> 00:21.889
My very own
Costco membership card!

00:21.922 --> 00:23.424
Now when we go together
on Sundays,

00:23.457 --> 00:25.859
you can enter six to eight
paces ahead of me.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.262
Plus, when offers say
"limit one per customer,"

00:28.296 --> 00:30.498
guess who
is two customers now.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.031
Hey, there's
my friend Zack.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.534
You and me.
The answer was you and me.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.104
Evan, they gave me a bag
for my underwear!

00:36.137 --> 00:37.638
Bye.

00:41.142 --> 00:44.345
What does
that mean -- WWJD?

00:44.378 --> 00:47.415
It stands for
"What Would Jesus Do?"

00:47.448 --> 00:51.185
Or maybe it stands for
"What Would Jessica Do?"

00:51.219 --> 00:52.453
(laughs)

00:52.486 --> 00:53.687
She would put that
in a safe place,

00:53.721 --> 00:55.856
because a replacement card
costs $16.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.591
(whistles)

00:58.726 --> 01:01.229
**

01:01.262 --> 01:02.396
* Fresh off the boat

01:02.430 --> 01:04.098
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:04.132 --> 01:06.234
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:06.267 --> 01:07.468
* Fresh off the boat

01:07.501 --> 01:09.937
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:09.970 --> 01:11.405
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:11.439 --> 01:14.007
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:16.277 --> 01:19.713
Oh, and we need
more dish soap.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.081
Let's get a barrel.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.716
When it's empty,
I saw it in half --

01:22.750 --> 01:24.218
two flower pots.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.286
Ooh!

01:25.319 --> 01:26.487
What a list.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.456
What a beautiful
Costco shopping list.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.791
Oh, could you add
Frosted Flakes?

01:30.824 --> 01:33.327
That would be
grrrrreat!

01:34.262 --> 01:36.330
It's what the tiger
on the box says.

01:36.364 --> 01:39.800
How does a tiger know
more English than Grandma?

01:39.833 --> 01:42.236
Well, I think Honey and I
are gonna head out.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.004
Saturday nights are
when we remind ourselves

01:44.037 --> 01:46.073
that we're
not just roommates.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.074
(both laugh)

01:47.107 --> 01:49.343
Okay, they didn't need
to know that, sweetie.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.779
Oh, Louis,
how much do I owe you?

01:51.812 --> 01:52.946
Oh, please,
put away your wallet.

01:52.980 --> 01:53.847
It's on me.

01:53.881 --> 01:54.782
You sure?

01:54.815 --> 01:56.450
Yes, Louis,
you sure?

01:56.484 --> 01:58.619
Absolutely.
It's the friends discount.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.522
Oh, thanks, Lou.
You know what?

02:01.555 --> 02:03.324
Why don't you stop by
my dental office

02:03.357 --> 02:05.693
for a cleaning
anytime,

02:05.726 --> 02:07.295
at the "friends price."

02:07.328 --> 02:08.862
I do have a little time
on Sunday

02:08.895 --> 02:10.764
while Jessica and Evan
are at Costco --

02:10.798 --> 02:12.833
like five
to eight hours.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.368
Done.
I'll see you then.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.670
I think it's lovely
you spend Saturday nights

02:16.704 --> 02:18.172
focused
on your marriage.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.640
When I have a wife,

02:19.673 --> 02:21.709
I'm gonna touch butts
with her every day.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.445
LOUIS: We, uh...

02:24.478 --> 02:26.647
We've been putting off
"the talk."

02:26.680 --> 02:28.048
(chuckles)

02:28.081 --> 02:29.350
Ah.
(chuckles)

02:32.353 --> 02:33.887
EVAN: Hey, Monica.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.122
Hey, Sam.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.690
Hey, Jason.

02:36.724 --> 02:37.991
(sighs)

02:38.025 --> 02:39.693
(indistinct talking)

02:39.727 --> 02:41.362
I feel so calm here,

02:41.395 --> 02:44.665
just knowing
all the bulk deals are waiting.

02:47.235 --> 02:50.971
An entire case
of mushroom soup for $4.99?

02:51.004 --> 02:53.874
Damn it, Costco,
you've done it again.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.180
Ooh, can we get this?

03:00.214 --> 03:02.182
(high-pitched voice)
* It's not unusual

03:02.216 --> 03:04.885
* To be loved by anyone

03:04.918 --> 03:06.754
That's silly. What would you
even use that for?

03:06.787 --> 03:08.756
It's 80% off.
We'll get two.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.928
Hey, Jessica! Evan!

03:14.962 --> 03:16.264
Don't wander far.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.165
I'm debuting
a spicy-ranch spread.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.534
Hi, Marie.
How's your cat, Sadie, doing?

03:20.568 --> 03:22.570
19 years old and still
bringing me mouse heads,

03:22.603 --> 03:23.604
bless her heart.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.443
I like the cool,
fiesta flavor.
I don't like this,

03:29.477 --> 03:31.745
but it's free,
so I will continue to chew.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.946
Mm, mm.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.948
(rapping) * Me and my homies,
we tighter than a glove *

03:34.982 --> 03:37.785
* We chop a lot of game is
how we do at the playaz club *

03:37.818 --> 03:39.086
* Jump in the pool
or kick it in the tub *

03:39.119 --> 03:42.456
* 'Cause we kick much ass
at the playaz club *

03:42.490 --> 03:44.692
* Somethin' to roll to,
somethin' to stroll to *

03:44.725 --> 03:46.527
* If you's a playa in the game,
this will hold you *

03:46.560 --> 03:49.563
* Mo' money, mo' money
for the bank roll *

03:49.597 --> 03:51.965
* Stick to the script,
don't slip in the nine-fo *

03:51.999 --> 03:54.234
* You can't resist it,
but don't get it twisted *

03:54.268 --> 03:56.637
* V.I.P., that means
the number's not listed *

03:56.670 --> 03:59.973
* Membership is based on clout
and how you carry yourself *

04:00.007 --> 04:01.442
* Now, homey,
what you all about? *

04:01.475 --> 04:02.376
* I stack paper
and kick it -- *

04:02.410 --> 04:03.477
(crunch)

04:05.913 --> 04:07.648
* Miss Goody-Two-Shoe,
I see you later *

04:07.681 --> 04:10.918
* I ain't got time, you ain't
nothin' but a playa hater *

04:10.951 --> 04:13.421
* Me and my homies,
we tighter than a glove *

04:13.454 --> 04:15.589
* We chop a lot of game is how
we do it at the playaz club *

04:15.623 --> 04:17.057
Another great Sunday.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.259
And not too rough
on the old pocketbook.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.628
Oh, by the way,

04:20.661 --> 04:23.230
my friend Zack wants
to hang out next Sunday.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.932
Great, next Sunday's
our toilet paper run.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.500
We could use
the extra set of hands

04:26.534 --> 04:28.469
to help carry
the 144-pack.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.604
Ooh, birthday cake.
Whose birthday is it?

04:30.638 --> 04:31.905
Look at the price,
Carmine.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.776
At 5 cents a cubic-inch,
it's all our birthdays.

04:35.809 --> 04:36.644
(laughs)

04:39.780 --> 04:42.282
Oh, you did great.

04:42.316 --> 04:46.086
No cavities.
Very little plaque.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.321
(muffled talking)

04:49.690 --> 04:50.791
(chuckles)

04:50.824 --> 04:51.659
That's true.

04:51.692 --> 04:52.760
Tooth plaque is bad,

04:52.793 --> 04:54.662
and the plaque you hang
on the wall is good.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.696
I never thought of that.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.297
You're all done,
buddy.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.366
Mm.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.337
Gah! What happened?!

05:03.371 --> 05:04.972
I threw a whitener
into the fluoride treatment.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.306
The "friends price."

05:06.340 --> 05:07.675
You're welcome, pal.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.610
Huh, it's very bright.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.379
It's just, uh...

05:11.412 --> 05:13.280
very bright.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.848
You'll get used to it.

05:14.882 --> 05:18.285
Your teeth haven't been
this clean since you were born.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.120
They're birth white.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.689
Trust me.
Everyone's gonna love it.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.556
Aah!

05:23.724 --> 05:25.526
What happened
to your teeth?

05:25.559 --> 05:27.795
Marvin snuck
tooth whitener in.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.163
I should've bought
those sunglasses.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.198
I didn't ask for this.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.866
Now I know how people
who wake up in bathtubs

05:32.900 --> 05:36.537
without their kidneys feel --
violated.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.071
Clean but violated.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.339
Did you get it?

05:39.373 --> 05:41.509
Yes, I got your
tiger sugar flakes.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.411
They're in the variety pack.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.879
Oh, Dad?
Yes?

05:45.913 --> 05:46.880
Oh, sorry.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.148
That's my default way
of speaking.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.918
I meant, "Ohh, Dad."

05:52.285 --> 05:54.422
Yes!

05:57.190 --> 05:58.225
Oh.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.764
It's not so bad.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.399
Give it a week.
I'm sure it'll fade.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.836
Aah!

06:08.869 --> 06:10.370
It's like living
with a lighthouse.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.272
(sighs) I feel like
it's gaining strength.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.242
Mom, could you pick up
some more Frosted Flakes today?

06:15.275 --> 06:16.276
Well, you still have
the variety pack left.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.310
I'm not going to
buy new cereal

06:17.344 --> 06:19.880
when there's still
perfectly good cereal left.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.416
But the rooster on the box
looks so serious.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.454
Finish these,
then I'll buy more.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.756
Evan, come on,
I want to get there early

06:28.789 --> 06:30.390
for the gas station
fistfights!

06:30.424 --> 06:31.825
You know I love that.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.696
Why are you
so dressed up?

06:35.729 --> 06:38.031
Is a guest author
coming today?

06:38.065 --> 06:40.300
Is Dean Koontz
coming back?

06:40.333 --> 06:42.570
Sorry, Mommy.
I can't go to Costco today.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.472
Zack and his mom
are picking me up.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.440
What do you mean?
Where are you going?

06:46.474 --> 06:47.541
To church.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.976
**

06:53.013 --> 06:54.147
Church?

06:54.181 --> 06:56.116
What do you mean "church"?

06:56.149 --> 06:58.552
Zack's always talking about it,
and it sounds fun.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.988
Remember, I told you
he wanted to hang out?

07:01.021 --> 07:02.422
(horn honks)
That's them.

07:02.456 --> 07:03.891
Don't sit
in the beanbag chairs

07:03.924 --> 07:06.326
without someone
to pull you out.

07:10.998 --> 07:11.999
Church?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.567
Yeah,
that was surprising.
But why?

07:13.601 --> 07:15.936
He knows we're mostly
lapsed Buddhists

07:15.969 --> 07:17.771
who believe in some
Chinese superstition

07:17.805 --> 07:19.840
but also like Christmas
but in a festive,

07:19.873 --> 07:21.575
not-religious way.

07:21.609 --> 07:24.478
He's probably just exploring.
I went through a similar phase.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.846
I was raised Buddhist

07:25.879 --> 07:27.447
but wanted to see
what else was out there.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.683
I almost converted
to Mormonism.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.451
So, we give up coffee,

07:31.485 --> 07:33.487
and in exchange,
we get a second wife?

07:37.190 --> 07:38.391
Hmm.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.332
Ultimately, I just
love caffeine too much.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.334
Church.

07:47.367 --> 07:48.536
Why would he want
to go there

07:48.569 --> 07:50.137
instead of to Costco
with me?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.272
Jessica, don't worry.
It's just one Sunday.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.373
You're right.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.275
You're right.
It's just one Sunday.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.177
He's probably
gonna be bored.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.880
It's fine.
I'll just go to Costco alone.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.148
It's no big deal.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.550
If you want,
I can go with you.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.285
Oh, uh, it's --

08:05.318 --> 08:09.489
it's just that
I know people there, and...

08:09.523 --> 08:11.058
You get it?

08:13.994 --> 08:17.130
Each one has a higher fiber
content than the last.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.298
Zero sugars?!

08:18.331 --> 08:20.634
How does this even qualify
as a cereal?

08:20.668 --> 08:22.135
(sighs)

08:22.169 --> 08:23.370
What if we put it
in our pockets

08:23.403 --> 08:24.638
and slip it down
our pant legs,

08:24.672 --> 08:26.039
like in
"Shawshank Redemption"?

08:26.073 --> 08:27.007
Mom will find it.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.142
She always sniffs out
wasted food.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.911
Remember when I didn't eat
my pizza crusts?

08:36.082 --> 08:38.385
She can get
real creative.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.419
That's what we need
to do --

08:40.453 --> 08:41.655
get creative.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.323
Rice Krispie Treats!

08:43.356 --> 08:45.693
If marshmallow and butter
can make these taste good,

08:45.726 --> 08:47.394
they'll make
all of these taste good.

08:47.427 --> 08:50.664
So, like
a Bad Cereal Treat?

08:50.698 --> 08:53.500
Like a
Bad-Ass Cereal Treat.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.402
Step aside.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.104
I'm gonna get my chef on.
* Yeah

08:57.137 --> 08:59.339
I present to you...

08:59.372 --> 09:01.074
the B.A.C.T. --

09:01.108 --> 09:02.876
the Bad-Ass Cereal Treat.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.979
(crunching)

09:10.150 --> 09:12.119
Is yours getting
any smaller?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.553
No.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.622
We should just
keep chewing.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.561
(Louis chuckling)

09:21.595 --> 09:23.230
Nope. It's just me.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.232
She's just making fun
of my teeth again.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.100
Each time more hurtfully
than the last.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.435
(laughs)

09:32.572 --> 09:34.307
**

09:34.341 --> 09:37.745
* Every time I think of you

09:37.778 --> 09:41.649
* I always catch my breath

09:41.682 --> 09:45.753
* And there's a heart
that's breaking *

09:45.786 --> 09:49.890
* Down this long-distance line
tonight *

09:49.923 --> 09:52.760
* I ain't missing you at all

09:52.793 --> 09:54.762
* Missing you

09:54.795 --> 09:57.765
* Since you've been gone

09:57.798 --> 09:59.232
* Missing you
* You're away

09:59.266 --> 10:00.801
* But I ain't missing you

10:00.834 --> 10:02.836
* Missing you

10:02.870 --> 10:04.938
Help! Someone!

10:04.972 --> 10:07.174
* No matter what...
Assist! Ugh!

10:07.207 --> 10:08.341
* ...all my friends say

10:08.375 --> 10:11.111
* I ain't missing you at all

10:12.813 --> 10:16.349
* I ain't missing you

10:16.383 --> 10:18.085
Ritz me, Marie.
I've had a day.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.486
Where's Evan?

10:19.519 --> 10:21.621
Oh, no. You didn't lose him,
did you?

10:21.655 --> 10:23.791
No. I didn't lose Evan.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.093
Although I might have.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.961
I just might have.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.463
What? Sorry.
I got distracted.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.366
Bailey's wearing
a tight smock again.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.804
**

10:40.974 --> 10:42.542
Hello, Evan!

10:42.575 --> 10:43.844
(door closes)

10:43.877 --> 10:45.979
I forgot you were out.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.849
That's right.
You had, uh, church.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.517
How was it? Boring?

10:50.550 --> 10:51.985
How boring was it?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.320
It wasn't boring
at all.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.188
Everyone knows everyone.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.790
There's crackers
and grape juice.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.292
They talk about values,
and they tell stories.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.728
Like, once,
there was this flood,

11:00.761 --> 11:03.496
so this man Noah
decided to build a boat

11:03.530 --> 11:04.664
for all the animals.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.867
He built a boat
by himself?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.202
Yeah, and he was
600 years old!

11:09.236 --> 11:10.203
What?

11:10.237 --> 11:13.073
And then he got
two of every animal on Earth

11:13.106 --> 11:14.908
and sailed around
for 40 days.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.309
Even snakes?

11:16.343 --> 11:18.011
Yeah,
he saved every animal.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.379
You're telling me a man

11:19.412 --> 11:21.081
had the chance
to let all the snakes drown,

11:21.114 --> 11:23.083
and instead,
he put two of them on a boat?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.417
No, that's not real.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.919
Next Sunday,
you should come with me.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.387
You can hear about it
yourself.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.322
Wait. You're going back
next Sunday?

11:29.356 --> 11:32.092
But Costco just got
the big bags of rice in stock.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.861
We could put one
on the bathroom scale

11:33.894 --> 11:35.896
and see if you weigh
more than it yet.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.164
That does sound fun,

11:37.197 --> 11:39.232
but I think I'd rather
go to church.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.468
Next week,
there's a guitarist coming.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.571
**

11:46.206 --> 11:49.442
Mmm.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.710
Oh, Louis, my friend,
come over here

11:50.744 --> 11:52.045
and meet the old boys
from dental school.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.247
(muffled) Hello.
Nice to meet you.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.783
Oh, buddy.
These burgers are so good.

11:55.816 --> 11:56.950
Great.
Juicy.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.685
Perfect temp.
Eh.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.453
Ah, don't mind Ted.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.721
You know
how every ad says

12:01.755 --> 12:03.957
four out of five dentists
recommend a product?

12:03.991 --> 12:05.358
He's that fifth guy.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.060
He can just
never get on board.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.029
What can I say?
I'm hard to please.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.263
(laughter)

12:10.297 --> 12:12.199
I gave Louis the cleaning
of his life last week

12:12.232 --> 12:13.366
at the "friends price."

12:13.400 --> 12:16.136
Go ahead.
Reveal that ivory curtain.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.306
Um...actually,
I need to work the floor, so...

12:19.339 --> 12:20.540
Come on, now.
Don't be shy.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.809
You look
like a million bucks.

12:21.842 --> 12:22.709
No, I'm good.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.577
Come on.
Smile. Smile.

12:24.611 --> 12:25.578
I don't want to smile.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.214
Smile!
No!

12:27.247 --> 12:28.481
I never wanted this!

12:28.515 --> 12:32.452
You can't just change the color
of a man's teeth without asking.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.788
Hey, I did you a favor,
as a friend.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.057
I liked my old teeth hue.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.459
I gave you 250 bucks
of free work,

12:39.492 --> 12:41.261
and I made you
easier on the eyes.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.163
I took you from a seven
to an eight --

12:43.196 --> 12:44.264
an eight and a half.

12:44.297 --> 12:48.201
I was never a seven!

12:51.204 --> 12:52.205
(thudding)

12:54.207 --> 12:55.575
It's getting harder.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.944
And I think,
somehow, bigger.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.245
It's Saturday night.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.779
If we don't finish
by tomorrow morning,

12:59.813 --> 13:01.314
we won't get
our Frosted Flakes.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.283
Like Tupac --
R.I.P. -- said,

13:03.316 --> 13:04.617
"No matter
how hard it gets,

13:04.651 --> 13:06.753
stick your chest out,
keep your head up,

13:06.786 --> 13:08.355
and handle it."

13:08.388 --> 13:10.090
Are they getting any closer
to catching his killer?

13:10.123 --> 13:11.324
No. They have no leads.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.393
Cops are
chasing their own tails!

13:17.197 --> 13:19.632
Don't look at me
while I do this.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.612
(swishing)

13:32.645 --> 13:33.646
(spits)

13:36.716 --> 13:38.718
Do you know what Evan is doing
alone in his room?

13:38.751 --> 13:40.553
Already? He's only 9.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.521
He's praying.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.857
Oh, yes, that's, uh...
what I thought, too.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.125
What is he saying?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.894
What conversation does he need
to be having with God

13:46.927 --> 13:48.395
that he can't have
with his own mother?

13:48.428 --> 13:49.629
If you're so curious,

13:49.662 --> 13:51.298
maybe you should
go to church with him.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.900
You know my family
wasn't religious.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.534
I just didn't
grow up that way.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.736
It all just seems
so strange.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.705
The only thing I know
about Christianity

13:58.738 --> 14:01.708
is the sad story
of Mary's son leaving her.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.644
There's more to it
than that.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.147
I do believe there's
something bigger out there.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.882
And there are upsides
to organized religion.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.750
I biked around for a summer
with the Mormons,

14:10.783 --> 14:11.919
and you should've seen
my calves.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.053
I mean, like pow, pow!

14:13.086 --> 14:14.321
He's just a boy.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.924
He doesn't need
pow-pow calves.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.525
But he does need
to find his own way,

14:18.558 --> 14:20.560
and you have to let him
see where this leads.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.029
What if I can't?

14:22.062 --> 14:23.396
You have to.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.232
**

14:33.873 --> 14:35.642
(deep voice)
Evan.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.012
God?

14:39.046 --> 14:41.548
Yes, Evan.
It's me -- God.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.917
I have a special message
for you.

14:43.951 --> 14:44.952
Don't go
to church anymore.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.954
What?!

14:46.987 --> 14:50.590
There's too many people already.
It's just too much.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.326
Go to Costco
with Mommy instead.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.728
(gasps)
Mommy!

14:55.762 --> 14:58.966
I was just getting
some applesauce.

14:58.999 --> 14:59.899
Jessica!

14:59.933 --> 15:02.302
I'm disappointed
in your betrayal.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.736
But I forgive you.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.605
That's what Jesus
would do.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.409
And, please,
wipe off the microphone

15:09.442 --> 15:10.710
when you're finished
with it.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.079
It's for both of us.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.780
**

15:18.651 --> 15:19.786
**

15:19.819 --> 15:21.154
(crunching)

15:21.188 --> 15:23.090
I'm going to church,
brothers.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.425
By the way,
if you hear the voice of God,

15:25.458 --> 15:26.493
it's just Mom.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.665
Evan, take this loaf
with you!

15:32.699 --> 15:33.833
Maybe the homeless
will want it!

15:33.866 --> 15:36.169
(sighs)
(door closes)

15:36.203 --> 15:38.438
I'm washing down bites
like pills.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.008
You faked being God?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.443
I mean, I know I say
I'm a god on the dance floor,

15:43.476 --> 15:45.478
but never in front
of the children.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.014
I didn't know
what else to do!

15:47.047 --> 15:48.248
I thought if I could
just get him back to Costco --

15:48.281 --> 15:49.983
EDDIE: Aah!

15:52.619 --> 15:54.654
I fink I chipped my toof.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.156
(gasps)

15:56.189 --> 15:57.991
**

16:02.662 --> 16:04.831
I'm sorry.
I just can't recommend it.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.933
(sighs)
Oh, come on, Ted.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.035
(Louis clears throat)

16:09.502 --> 16:10.837
MARVIN: Louis.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.672
Well, do you
have an appointment?

16:12.705 --> 16:16.009
Uh...look, I know things
were awkward the other night.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.211
Eddie! Kiddo,
what happened?

16:18.245 --> 16:19.512
B.A.C.T.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.814
Oh, is that an acronym
for a Rice Krispie-style treat

16:21.848 --> 16:23.016
you tried to make
out of the duds

16:23.050 --> 16:24.351
of a variety pack?

16:25.318 --> 16:27.354
I'm a dentist.
I've seen everything.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.657
Come on. Hop up in the chair,
and let's bib you up.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.625
I'll take a gold cap like
Big Daddy Kane, if you got it.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.127
(chuckles)
No. Just a normal cap.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.030
I'm sorry
I blew up at the restaurant.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.331
No, I'm sorry.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.499
It was presumptuous
of me to assume

16:39.532 --> 16:42.069
that you wanted to look
so damn fantastic.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.036
(chuckles)

16:43.070 --> 16:44.171
You were never a seven.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.638
You were always a nine.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.506
(chuckles)

16:46.539 --> 16:48.108
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.910
(sighs)
Oh.

16:50.943 --> 16:51.744
Um...

16:51.778 --> 16:53.012
Just so we're clear,

16:53.046 --> 16:55.415
I'm going to pay full price
for Eddie's dental work.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.684
I think it's better that way,
for our friendship.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.718
Agreed.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.553
And I'll pay full price
at your restaurant.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.322
Well, I'm glad
we worked this out.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.390
Yeah.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.391
Oh.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.159
Oh.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.394
(both chuckle)

17:07.426 --> 17:08.661
Oh, and don't worry.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.029
That whitening agent
that I use

17:10.063 --> 17:11.330
only lasts
four to six weeks.
(sighs)

17:11.364 --> 17:13.500
Which is why
I cannot recommend it.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.567
We get it, Ted!

17:14.601 --> 17:16.035
Okay?

17:16.069 --> 17:19.038
We get it!

17:19.071 --> 17:20.440
**

17:20.473 --> 17:22.942
Hey, Jessica.
Special today --

17:22.974 --> 17:24.511
Ritz-os.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.945
Who needs tortilla chips
to make nachos?

17:28.881 --> 17:31.751
Oh, no.
I can make it less spicy.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.886
Can I talk to you
about something?

17:33.920 --> 17:34.921
Oh, sure.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.590
Uh, but I just need
to make some more samples,

17:37.624 --> 17:39.359
so how about I get the crackers,
you get the salsa.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.493
We'll chat in the aisle.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.629
**

17:48.435 --> 17:49.636
So, how can I help?

17:49.669 --> 17:51.104
You were right.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.905
I have lost Evan...

17:53.906 --> 17:54.941
...to church.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.643
We used to spend
every Sunday together,

17:56.676 --> 18:00.613
and now he goes there
instead of here with me.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.382
Oh, I see.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.317
And why does this
upset you so?

18:04.351 --> 18:06.753
(sighing)
I don't know.

18:06.786 --> 18:10.657
I'm afraid I'm losing my baby
to something I don't understand.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.493
Well, you know,
the first rule of sampling is,

18:13.526 --> 18:15.762
always ask the customer
what it is

18:15.795 --> 18:17.564
they like
about the sample.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.899
Shouldn't the first rule
be hygiene?

18:19.932 --> 18:22.835
Have you asked Evan
what he likes about church?

18:22.869 --> 18:26.806
Yes, he says it's fun,
everybody knows everybody,

18:26.839 --> 18:29.642
they talk about values,
and they have good snacks.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.179
Sounds like a place
we both know and love.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.646
What place?

18:33.680 --> 18:35.348
Look around you.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.618
(organ plays)

18:38.651 --> 18:40.853
The community.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.622
The values.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.425
The sense of calm I get
just walking in the door.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.495
Church is Evan's Costco!

18:51.298 --> 18:52.432
Excuse me, sir.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.301
Are you Greg?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.135
(organ stops)
Your wife sent me.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.171
You're supposed to be getting
chicken nuggets and milk.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.875
(sighs)

19:02.909 --> 19:04.877
(bells tolling)

19:06.713 --> 19:08.348
(indistinct conversations)

19:08.381 --> 19:09.782
Mommy!

19:09.816 --> 19:11.551
(sighs)
This is your bulk deals,

19:11.584 --> 19:13.953
and if that's what you want,
you can have it.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.956
I mean, I wish that bulk deals
were your bulk deals,

19:16.989 --> 19:18.024
but whatever.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.359
You're young.
You have time.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.293
Eternity.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.661
Sure.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.696
For now, the only thing
that matters to me

19:23.730 --> 19:25.865
is that we get
to spend Sundays together.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.634
So, you'll come
to church with me?

19:27.667 --> 19:30.203
I will come
to outside church with you,

19:30.237 --> 19:31.471
and then you can go in.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.306
I'm good out here.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.375
But I'll wait for you.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.744
And then you can tell me
all about it.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.313
Today, we learned
about this man Jonah

19:40.347 --> 19:42.815
who lived in the belly
of a whale for three whole days.

19:42.849 --> 19:43.983
Impossible.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.718
What was that?
Nothing. Go on.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.254
Oh, and get this.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.489
They have something called
Sunday School here.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.359
It's school on Sundays!

19:52.392 --> 19:54.193
No kidding?!

19:54.227 --> 19:55.895
Ah!

20:01.067 --> 20:03.570
Evan (sighs) you ready for me
to drive you to church?

20:03.603 --> 20:05.171
I thought I'd come
to Costco today.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.775
They just got in the off-model
Kenneth Cole kids' blazers.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.610
Is that okay?

20:10.643 --> 20:13.713
Oh, y-yeah.
Of course it is.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.716
Great, and I can go
to church next Sunday.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.218
(softly) We'll see.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.087
Eddie, I'll pick you up
some porridge

20:21.120 --> 20:22.555
since you could
only eat soft food.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.123
Does that mean
I don't have to finish this?

20:24.156 --> 20:25.258
Of course you don't.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.794
And I don't expect Emery
to have to finish it by himself.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.698
I'll boil it
and make a stock.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.732
(both sigh)

20:32.765 --> 20:35.201
(thuds)

20:35.234 --> 20:36.703
Okay.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.071
Let's go get you
that blazer.

20:39.105 --> 20:42.309
My right arm is
slightly longer than my left.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.777
It's like God made my body
for factory mistakes.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.146
Or maybe I've just always
held your right hand

20:47.179 --> 20:49.782
with just enough tension
to stretch it.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.952
God's got nothing
on Mommy.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.821
**

20:58.758 --> 20:59.826
**

21:01.761 --> 21:02.795
Okay. You're up.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.266
I weigh more than the rice.
I'm growing!

21:08.501 --> 21:10.503
You think you're ready
for the keg of mayonnaise yet?

21:10.537 --> 21:13.506
Someday, but not today.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.976
Okay, now let's try it
with this carpet steamer.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.978
If I weigh less,
we get Pop-Tarts.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.814
If I weigh more,
we never speak of it again.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.783

21:25.017 --> 21:27.286
