00:02.370 --> 00:03.737
-The Lyons are
hitting back on Empire.
-(shouts)

00:03.771 --> 00:06.174
-May we rise.
-Like we always do.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.211
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.244 --> 00:13.081
Star, 9-1-1, and The Resident.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.215
That's a win-win.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.153
-Previously on Empire...
-I'm Damon Cross.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.821
I'm a game changer.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.123
Your boy sold the Derrick Adams.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.725
-Get me that damn painting.
-TIANA: Walking around with

00:24.758 --> 00:27.895
that gun on your hip is not
gonna bring back what we lost.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.264
You're a tech guy,
so why Empire?

00:30.298 --> 00:32.900
I'm going to erase him
from the face of the earth.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.868
How's that for talent, Dad?

00:34.902 --> 00:36.904
He doesn't love you, Maya.
That's not love.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.539
Cookie, you have your own family
to fix.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.873
I got a loft in SoHo.

00:39.907 --> 00:42.376
You promised that
you would never tell or sell.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.512
CANDACE: You called the police
on my son.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.214
I never want to see you again.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.760
Lucious, I just got a call
that he's in surgery.

00:59.793 --> 01:03.597
What happened?
Is that blood?

01:03.631 --> 01:05.266
Lucious, what did you do?

01:07.801 --> 01:10.271
What did you do?

01:10.304 --> 01:12.306
*

01:17.245 --> 01:18.579
COOKIE (sighs):
Come on, Candace.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.114
Stop being like this.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.882
We need to talk this through.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.152
Can you call me back, please?

01:24.185 --> 01:26.287
You need to stop being
like this.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.322
You know how your sister is,
baby.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.324
It's been two weeks, Lucious.

01:30.358 --> 01:33.294
I need to know how she's doing,
how's Franklin doing.

01:33.327 --> 01:36.897
(groans) She's gonna talk
when she's good and ready, baby.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.799
Maybe I shouldn't have
called the cops.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.334
Come on, now.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.136
Baby, you have

01:42.170 --> 01:45.639
been through this...
a dozen times.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.741
Stop beating yourself up
over this.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.910
You did the right thing.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.513
Besides, not like
she's the only one

01:52.546 --> 01:54.415
that's been through the fire,
you know?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.284
We done been...
Oh, man.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.352
We forgot Jamal.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.654
-This morning.
-Aah. What time is it? (sighs)

02:02.790 --> 02:04.792
* You feel like a vacation

02:04.825 --> 02:07.261
* You feel
like a vacation *

02:07.295 --> 02:09.463
-* 'Cause loving you is easy
-(sighs)

02:09.497 --> 02:11.765
* Like a summer day

02:11.799 --> 02:14.502
* Fun without the games

02:14.535 --> 02:17.104
* You're good for me,
oh, baby *

02:17.137 --> 02:18.539
* Loving you is easy

02:18.572 --> 02:21.175
* We do it every night

02:21.209 --> 02:24.178
* It's like paradise

02:24.212 --> 02:27.681
* Just you and I, oh, baby.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.217
Thank you.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.354
Jamal, the new song is fire.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.189
Thank you, man.
I saw you jamming.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.225
-Y'all know y'all saw that.
-No, I-I was in it. Um,

02:37.258 --> 02:38.826
it seems like
you're in a really good place.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.628
Oh, definitely.
Amazing place. Um...

02:40.661 --> 02:42.463
-Yeah. No. The Lyons are back.
-Mm.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.565
-You know? And, uh,
with my family...
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.034
...my mom and dad starting
the new Lyon Family Management,

02:47.067 --> 02:48.702
and we're about
to do this crazy showcase.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.205
-Oh, you'll be performing?
-Of cour... of course, man.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.706
-Come on. Me and...
-Okay. All right, okay.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.376
...my brother, Hakeem, you know,
we'll be releasing new music.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.711
And then, also, on top of that,
the brand-new artists...

02:57.745 --> 03:00.514
-Mm.
-...who are just amazing,
at Lyon Family Management.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.483
So, yes, LFM is ready

03:02.516 --> 03:05.152
for a second time around
to crush the music industry.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.054
-All right, we cannot wait.
-(Cookie sighs)

03:07.087 --> 03:09.423
KEVIN: By the way, you seem like
you're really happy. What's up?

03:09.457 --> 03:10.724
-I'm so happy.
I'm so happy, man.
-What's up?

03:10.758 --> 03:12.426
I'm so happy.
I'm happy to be home.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.061
I'm happy to, you know...

03:14.094 --> 03:16.730
I'm in love,
I'm, uh, I'm-I'm engaged.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.699
I'm very happy.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.702
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
-Congratulations.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.371
You heard it here first.
Jamal Lyon engaged.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.105
Who's the lucky guy?

03:25.138 --> 03:26.574
Uh, his name is Kai Givens.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.342
-Kai. I know Kai.
-You do.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.345
-Kai Givens is
a great TV journalist. Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.415
-Please give him
my best regards.
-Absolutely. Uh, babe?

03:34.448 --> 03:36.116
Uh... (chuckles)
Best regards.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.018
He's right there. Hey, babe.

03:38.051 --> 03:42.089
Oh, Kai. Trevor, let's get
this shot. Hey, Kai. Kai.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.057
How long have you
and Jamal been an item?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.526
How did you meet?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.027
Don't that make you feel better?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.596
(laughing):
Uh, yes!

03:48.629 --> 03:50.598
Jamal's got the public
all primed for the showcase.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.099
I'm going to work.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.601
Oh, will you do me a favor
and get me

03:53.634 --> 03:55.636
something out of the top drawer?
I left it in there.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.071
-What...?
-I got you something.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.441
Um, Lucious,
we are still busted.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.043
Open the box.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.578
What is this?

04:04.612 --> 04:06.380
(Lucious sighs)

04:06.414 --> 04:08.716
(chuckling):
What is this?

04:08.749 --> 04:11.251
This is your favorite
jewelry store,

04:11.285 --> 04:13.621
and it's a picture
of all the things you want,

04:13.654 --> 04:15.723
and I'm-a buy everything
in that window

04:15.756 --> 04:17.958
-because you're my everything.
-(chuckling)

04:17.991 --> 04:20.628
And I'm all in, baby.

04:20.661 --> 04:24.264
-You're so sweet. (chuckling)
-Mmm.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.300
I'm telling you, if you peek,
I'm gonna come back

04:26.334 --> 04:28.469
-in your next life...
-Don't you run me into a wall.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.638
-No. Turn, turn, turn!
-No! Stop!

04:30.671 --> 04:32.139
(both laughing)

04:32.172 --> 04:33.641
-Five more steps.
-Ooh, my earring fell.

04:33.674 --> 04:37.110
One, two, three, four, five.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.646
-Here.
-Okay, can I open my eyes?

04:38.679 --> 04:40.648
-Okay! Yeah, wait.
On three. One, two...
-Three!

04:40.681 --> 04:42.683
-Three.
-(Cookie gasps loudly)

04:42.716 --> 04:45.486
-God, is that a Derrick Adams?
-(chuckling)

04:47.154 --> 04:50.591
Oh, Lucious, it's amazing!

04:50.624 --> 04:52.626
But we can't afford this.

04:52.660 --> 04:57.030
This portrait is my bet on us.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.367
It's you and me forever, kid.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.268
Forever.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.472
(chuckling)
You are so sweet.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.609
-You just let that stuff go,
okay?
-Mmm.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.644
-Okay.
-You did the right thing.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.315
*

05:17.385 --> 05:20.187
Thanks for gathering
on short notice, everyone.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.956
I wanted you to hear this from
me before it hits the press.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.225
Effective immediately,

05:25.258 --> 05:27.495
Empire is pulling
Lucious Lyon's music

05:27.528 --> 05:29.062
from all streaming platforms,

05:29.096 --> 05:30.664
store shelves
and ancillary markets.

05:30.698 --> 05:34.167
That includes film,
television and commercials.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.503
I'm sorry. I thought

05:35.536 --> 05:37.538
that you and Lucious
had kissed and made up.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.340
You of all people should know
that this is just business.

05:40.374 --> 05:43.310
Just business?! I'm sorry.
What is the goal here?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.514
Years ago, Disney Animation
proved, very convincingly,

05:46.547 --> 05:49.049
that temporary scarcity leads
to increased demand

05:49.082 --> 05:51.218
and inevitably,
to windfall profits.

05:51.251 --> 05:55.222
True, but they warned their fans
first before they vaulted,

05:55.255 --> 05:56.890
so people ran out
and bought a bunch of product.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.225
I did.

05:58.258 --> 06:01.228
You have kids, right, Lavar?

06:01.261 --> 06:03.063
A little boy and a girl,
eight and ten.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.231
I bet they love Disney,
don't they?

06:04.264 --> 06:06.099
(chuckling):
Absolute fanatics.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.101
As a matter of fact, I'm taking
'em over spring break.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.369
-Oh, that's fantastic.
-Oh.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.904
I bet
that's a rather expensive trip

06:10.938 --> 06:12.272
when you're on unemployment.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.944
-You're fired.
-I'm sorry, what? What did I do?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.879
You spoke when you should have
been listening.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.615
Meeting adjourned.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.095
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh *

06:35.128 --> 06:38.432
* Stop it, no, you can't
stop it, you know I'm poppin' *

06:38.466 --> 06:41.869
-* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh *
-Yeah.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.872
* Option, no other option,
I got to pop this *

06:44.905 --> 06:46.239
* All this time
I thought falling was breaking *

06:46.273 --> 06:48.108
* But I was mistaken

06:48.141 --> 06:51.311
* I did that out of the ashes,
a star in the making *

06:51.344 --> 06:54.548
* I'm thriving steady, surviving
while y'all just getting by *

06:54.582 --> 06:57.284
* No need to fake it to make it,
'cause the money never lie *

06:57.317 --> 07:00.554
* Never lie, all these blessings
let me testify *

07:00.588 --> 07:03.891
* All these doors that open,
I prefer them to suicide *

07:03.924 --> 07:05.559
* It's a celebration,
come and join the conversation *

07:05.593 --> 07:08.796
* Yeah, you know the reputation,
so, baby *

07:08.829 --> 07:10.998
* Don't ever play yourself

07:11.031 --> 07:14.167
* I, I, I put it on the line

07:14.201 --> 07:16.937
* Every dollar,
every dime, why not *

07:16.970 --> 07:20.140
* I, I, I made it
through the fire... *

07:20.173 --> 07:23.443
-Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up.
-* Came out on the other s...

07:23.477 --> 07:25.813
-I'm still not feeling it, man.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.481
What aren't you feeling,
Carlito?

07:27.515 --> 07:29.149
How you got these two pulling
anchor on this joint.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.818
My songs are blowing up
on SoundCloud right now.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.152
It is what it is, bro.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.487
(scoffs)

07:33.521 --> 07:35.523
Why am I even doing
this stupid showcase?

07:35.556 --> 07:37.357
My talent speaks for itself.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.859
And we're paying for this,
anyways, right?

07:38.892 --> 07:41.428
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Is that true?

07:41.461 --> 07:42.763
We're paying for this
out of our pocket?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.131
Yo, read your damn contract.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.466
It's under what's called
"an advance."

07:46.500 --> 07:50.437
Aah! I don't believe this
nonsense I'm hearing right now!

07:50.470 --> 07:52.940
Y'all are like
the Misfit Toys up in here.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.808
We won you in the poker game.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.945
And we rescued
old Fred Sanford and Son

07:57.978 --> 08:00.013
right here
from the damn junkyard!

08:00.047 --> 08:02.049
LUCIOUS: Uh, baby, baby, look.
Look, y'all.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.383
Why don't we all
take five minutes

08:03.416 --> 08:05.218
and get on the same page,
all right?

08:05.252 --> 08:06.286
Oh, no, we ain't going nowhere.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.855
Ain't nobody going nowhere!

08:07.888 --> 08:10.824
And, yes, this would be
considered an advance.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.159
But me and Lucious are paying

08:12.192 --> 08:13.794
for this out of our pockets,
okay?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.395
What you need
to be concerned with

08:15.428 --> 08:18.398
is making this song
and the showcase hot!

08:18.431 --> 08:20.834
Then you'll get
your little stacks, okay?

08:20.868 --> 08:25.372
And you best believe I'm taking
my cut, 'cause I did this.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.208
-Yeah, thanks.
-Are we clear?!

08:28.241 --> 08:30.410
Get your ass back on that mic
and sing, come on.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.179
Now-now we good, now?

08:32.212 --> 08:33.814
Yeah, we good.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.315
Okay, big daddy,
take it from the top!

08:35.348 --> 08:37.350
COOKIE: And leave them damn egos
outside.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.352
We don't have room
for them in here, okay?

08:39.386 --> 08:41.188
DEVON: Look, man,
let's-let's just do this.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.090
-Let's just get this over with.
-COOKIE: Yeah.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.326
One, two.
One, two, three.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.229
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh *

08:49.262 --> 08:52.199
* Stop it, no, you can't
stop it, you know I'm poppin' *

08:52.232 --> 08:55.736
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh *

08:55.769 --> 08:59.172
* Option, no other option,
I got to pop this *

08:59.206 --> 09:01.008
* All this time I thought
falling was breaking... *

09:01.041 --> 09:02.743
Where are we with the venue,
Thirsty?

09:02.776 --> 09:04.778
Oh, it's Gucci, baby. The owner
got a little side-piece,

09:04.812 --> 09:08.181
didn't want wifey to know,
so I got it on cost. (laughs)

09:08.215 --> 09:09.783
My man.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.352
Excuse me.
Miss Williams is here.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.855
Oh, Lord. Becky, what?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.024
Kingsley done sent you
on a spy mission, huh? 007?

09:17.057 --> 09:19.226
-(chuckling)
-No.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.061
Um, no one knows about this yet,

09:21.094 --> 09:22.963
and I didn't want you
to be blindsided,

09:22.996 --> 09:25.132
but Kingsley is vaulting
your entire catalog.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.368
-He's what?
-What does that mean?
-(Cookie sighs)

09:28.401 --> 09:30.437
Um, every single Lucious Lyon
song ever written

09:30.470 --> 09:32.740
and recorded is now on lockdown.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.709
That's gonna slow your residuals
down to a trickle, Pop.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.210
(sighs) Yeah, I'm sorry.
I would've called,

09:37.244 --> 09:39.412
but you blocked me,
so, I'm gonna go.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.281
Thanks, Becky.
Appreciate it.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.617
-Mm-hmm.
-Just blew in
with the bad news, huh?

09:43.651 --> 09:45.118
Those residuals

09:45.152 --> 09:47.054
was the only thing
holding everything together.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.156
I know. I-I know.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.124
That's his ass.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.826
-No, Lucious.
-No, that's his ass!

09:52.860 --> 09:55.128
-Hey, hey.
-Lucious, listen.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.932
Kingsley knows that LFM is about
to do something major,

09:58.966 --> 10:01.134
so he's trying
to throw you off your game.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.036
Don't let him do it.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.410
Hakeem.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.747
Hakeem, I know
you hear me talking to you.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.149
This beef with Blake
is getting out of control.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.652
Babe, you've seen me end it
on Instagram already.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.755
I'm getting death threats,
and that's bad enough.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.124
But today, they k...

10:24.157 --> 10:27.995
They're threatening the kids,
and that's off-limits.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.097
Blake fans are crazy.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.767
Ain't nobody gonna touch you or
the kids, I guarantee you that.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.803
Just talk to Blake.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.671
Please.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.139
I'm scared for the kids.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.309
Okay.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.644
Clean this place up.
It's a damn mess.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.019
Grandma, look. It's Daddy
and Tata singing on TV.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.121
Okay, let me see, baby.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.823
Let me see.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.729
Ooh, it sure is.
Look at that.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.297
-I'm so proud of...
-Ms. Cookie, you have a guest.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.800
Uh, you know what, sweetheart?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.802
Why don't you go

11:08.836 --> 11:11.071
with Ms. Juanita and finish
working on this masterpiece

11:11.104 --> 11:13.807
so Grandma can put it
on her refrigerator, okay?

11:13.841 --> 11:15.242
I'm so proud of you.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.810
Come on here,
Little Miss Picasso.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.679
-Give Granny a big hug. Hmm?
-(kisses)

11:19.713 --> 11:21.581
-Bye, sweetie.
-Come go with me,

11:21.614 --> 11:23.884
so that you can finish coloring.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.692
(Cookie humming a tune)

11:33.727 --> 11:35.562
Evan and I broke up.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.932
(chuckles): You were right.
I mean, he is a complete dick.

11:38.966 --> 11:42.235
Cookie, I was wondering
if I could stay here.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.738
Oh, don't your
momma and daddy got a roof

11:44.772 --> 11:46.573
and four walls
you could stay under?

11:46.606 --> 11:48.041
We're not exactly
getting along right now.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.177
Yeah, probably 'cause
of your nasty-ass attitude.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.945
(chuckles):
I don't blame them.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.781
I didn't mean those things
that I said to you.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.548
I was just, like, upset.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.784
Please...

11:56.817 --> 11:59.652
you're, like, my only hope.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.691
You need to call your parents
and let them know where you are.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.961
And this is temporary, so wipe
that smirk off your face.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.097
Come next month,
you won't be in my kitchen

12:10.130 --> 12:11.965
begging for snacks
with your little ashy ass.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.835
I would like you to know
I am thoroughly moisturized.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.206
Come on, Cookie,
you can't actually...

12:19.239 --> 12:21.274
Uh-uh-uh-uh!
If you're living under my roof,

12:21.308 --> 12:24.244
you're gonna have to get a job,
you understand?

12:24.277 --> 12:25.645
Okay. Yes, ma'am.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.785
Here. For your hungry ass.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.720
Thank you, Cookie.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.088
COOKIE:
Mm-hmm.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.799
Hey.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.734
You come to my house,

12:47.767 --> 12:49.769
you sit with my family,

12:49.803 --> 12:51.471
at my table...

12:51.504 --> 12:54.474
Was that to try and lull me
to sleep or something?

12:54.507 --> 12:56.009
No, no, no. I...

12:56.043 --> 12:59.779
I really had quite a day
with the Lucious Lyon clan.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.581
I-I did.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.485
Still brings a smile to my face
when I think about it, actually.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.487
If you're angry
about the vaulting,

13:07.520 --> 13:09.857
you know as well as I do,
Lucious, it's just business.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.491
It was bad business.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.927
I mean, why do it
at the beginning of your quarter

13:13.961 --> 13:16.496
when you know that your revenue
is gonna take a hit?

13:16.529 --> 13:18.832
Come on, dude,
that's just long-term strategy.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.434
LUCIOUS:
No, that's not strategy.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.470
Strategy is negotiating with me.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.538
You know, lock up some

13:25.572 --> 13:29.042
of my music, like Prince did
back in the day with YouTube,

13:29.076 --> 13:31.778
and therefore
we both make out on top.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.814
That's assuming that I want
your little venture to succeed.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.116
Why wouldn't you?

13:36.149 --> 13:38.151
I mean, LFM is not a label.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.887
It's not in competition here.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.956
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Lucious.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.959
I'm gonna start a new management
division here at Empire.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.862
Then I would say that
you're acting like somebody

13:48.896 --> 13:52.132
that don't care about
their life much longer.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.466
Is that a threat?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.502
Why do you keep firing people

13:55.535 --> 13:57.470
at your staff meetings?

13:57.504 --> 14:00.407
What are you afraid of?

14:01.741 --> 14:03.376
I wonder what Steve Jobs
would think

14:03.410 --> 14:05.578
about your bitch-ass moves.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.717
You want to know the real reason

14:10.750 --> 14:12.920
that I vaulted your music,
Lucious?

14:12.953 --> 14:16.389
It's because I'm going to wipe
you from the consciousness

14:16.423 --> 14:19.059
of an entire generation.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.395
I'm gonna make you extinct.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.032
That sounds personal, Jeff.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.733
That doesn't sound
like strategy.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.846
So, Kingsley
finally showed his ass.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.015
-This is personal.
-Mm-hmm.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.384
-Hey, are you listening?
-Okay.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.354
I'll see you and Quincy
tonight. All right. Bye.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.057
Putting your girl
in front of business, huh?

14:50.090 --> 14:52.359
-Well, this is important,
too, Pop.
-Well, she can't be

14:52.392 --> 14:53.860
that important--
we ain't met her yet.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.029
-This one real?
-(chuckles) Stop.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.898
We have to find out
what's Kingsley gonna do

14:58.932 --> 15:01.568
about the lost revenue
from my music.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.371
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe he's replacing it somehow.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.640
I don't understand. I know
how much money your music made

15:07.674 --> 15:09.977
for Empire, Pop--
it's gonna cost them millions.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.979
Okay? There has to be
a supplemental revenue stream

15:12.012 --> 15:13.981
to replace what they've lost.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.783
Yeah, well, we need to find out
where that money's coming from.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.651
This sucker's up to something,

15:18.685 --> 15:21.054
and I don't want
to be blindsided again.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.623
-We got you, Pop.
-Oh.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.960
And look, your mama's... she got
a lot on her plate right now,

15:26.994 --> 15:29.296
so let's kind of
keep this quiet.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.430
Hey, mum's the word.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.464
Welcome back.

15:31.498 --> 15:32.966
What is it, Casual Friday?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.501
Wear a suit.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.469
THIRSTY:
It'll get done, boss man,

15:36.503 --> 15:38.305
it'll get done.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.572
LUCIOUS:
Okay.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.907
(door closes)

15:40.940 --> 15:42.775
Lucious.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.917
Don't lie to me.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.453
Did you go see Kingsley?

15:53.486 --> 15:57.624
Let's just say I went
on a fact-finding mission.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.693
Baby, that music's our legacy.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.795
That music is our past, Lucious.

16:02.829 --> 16:06.666
We are working on our future,
and I can't do it alone.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.468
I'm right here with you, baby.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.771
Look, I'm just trying
to make sure that LFM...

16:11.804 --> 16:15.942
grows up and gets
big and strong, so that nobody

16:15.975 --> 16:18.478
can ever hold power
over us again.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.946
That's all.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.949
We're in this forever,
you and me.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.984
Together.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.793
Can you believe that?
That's the third case

16:33.826 --> 16:35.728
that we've lost to him!

16:35.762 --> 16:37.964
I'm telling you,
Eddie has paid that judge off.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.666
(sighs heavily)

16:41.534 --> 16:43.970
Maybe we just take the "L,"

16:44.003 --> 16:46.706
-and start something else new.
-I don't know about you,

16:46.739 --> 16:48.541
but I'm-I'm not quitting.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.243
Maybe if you...

16:51.578 --> 16:52.679
(Lucious sighs)

16:52.712 --> 16:54.814
Go ahead and say it, Lucious.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.384
You blame me for losing Empire.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.919
-Say it.
-No, don't try and put
no words in my mouth.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.556
Where are you going?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.325
Oh, I'm getting
the hell out of here

17:05.358 --> 17:07.360
before I say something
that can't get unsaid.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.399
(playing
"In a Sentimental Mood")

17:25.445 --> 17:27.447
*

17:29.216 --> 17:31.384
I know what you're thinking.

17:31.418 --> 17:35.222
Really? That's your pickup line?
(chuckles)

17:35.255 --> 17:36.923
You're thinking...

17:36.956 --> 17:40.593
dude on the drums can't keep
time to save his life, but...

17:40.627 --> 17:43.396
homie on the sax
might have potential.

17:44.931 --> 17:48.468
Tell you what, if I'm right,
you buy me a drink.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.376
Another whiskey, neat,

17:56.409 --> 17:58.278
and whatever
this gentleman's having.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.412
Ah...

17:59.446 --> 18:00.647
Two.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.282
(both chuckle)

18:02.315 --> 18:04.451
I saw you watching the band.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.619
You looked very... intent.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.555
And so are you.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.258
I'm married.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.461
Well... I hope he knows
how lucky he is.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.264
-WAITER: Sir?
-Yeah, he thanks God every day.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.299
(chuckles quietly)

18:19.332 --> 18:22.535
*

18:25.172 --> 18:26.839
(sighs)
Whoa.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.675
You can't take no for an answer?

18:28.708 --> 18:32.145
(chuckles): I got a deal
that's supposed to be a lay-up

18:32.179 --> 18:33.346
that's suddenly cratering.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.814
-I got to get uptown.
-(chuckles)

18:34.847 --> 18:36.283
-Whoa.
-Damn.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.785
-What is that?
-It seems like we stopped.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.820
-Stopped?
-Oh, no...

18:40.853 --> 18:42.789
(pressing button repeatedly)

18:42.822 --> 18:44.257
No. What is this?

18:44.291 --> 18:46.326
(grunts)

18:46.359 --> 18:48.261
-(takes deep breath)
-Uh, are you okay?

18:48.295 --> 18:50.297
Truthfully, I get a little...

18:50.330 --> 18:51.598
claustrophobic, but I'm...

18:51.631 --> 18:53.500
-Are you all right?
-Nah, I'm cool.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.602
I spent a lot of time
in confined spaces...

18:55.635 --> 18:57.270
But, uh, let me help you.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.206
-(taking deep breaths)
-Okay? Just,

18:59.239 --> 19:00.673
uh, take a deep breath.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.442
Yeah, take your jacket off.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.512
(laughs)
That'll give you some air.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.848
Yeah, just deep breath,
deep breath, yeah, and out.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.151
What's this?

19:13.386 --> 19:15.488
(panting):
That's something special

19:15.522 --> 19:17.790
for the most important person
in my life.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.393
-Can I see it?
-Yeah.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.128
That's beautiful.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.797
-She's lucky.
-Yeah, this is for my daughter.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.667
She's... she's five years
cancer-free this week.

19:27.700 --> 19:31.204
-It's her birthstone, and, uh...
-Mm-hmm.

19:31.238 --> 19:34.574
...this is in memory of...
my wife, you know,

19:34.607 --> 19:37.577
to let her know her mother
will always be with her.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.413
-(elevator buzzes, whirrs)
-Oh.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.649
-Here you go.
-Ah, thank you.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.084
-For distracting me.
-(laughs)

19:45.117 --> 19:48.054
No, thank you
for distracting me.

19:48.087 --> 19:49.389
(takes deep breath)

19:49.422 --> 19:52.091
Got into an argument
with my husband earlier.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.426
DAMON:
Mm.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.062
He could be a frustrating
son of a bitch.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.196
Oh, really? Is he?

19:57.230 --> 20:00.533
But he's also
the love of my life. Hmm.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.771
-(elevator clacks, beeps)
-Whoa.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.740
-Ah-ha! We made it!
-(laughs) Yes!

20:07.774 --> 20:09.542
-Good luck uptown.
-Thank you.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.544
Um, excuse me, you...

20:11.578 --> 20:14.180
you could at least tell me
what your name is.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.282
Cookie.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.250
Cookie Lyon.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.262
(piano playing gentle melody)

20:29.296 --> 20:31.298
*

20:41.240 --> 20:42.742
(stops playing)

20:45.778 --> 20:47.314
You okay, babe?

20:47.347 --> 20:50.049
Suddenly you're
paying attention to my feelings?

20:50.082 --> 20:51.418
Whoa.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.354
Where'd that come from?

20:55.988 --> 20:58.591
I spent ten years making sure
that I was thought of

20:58.625 --> 21:00.259
as a serious journalist.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.962
Then you put our business
on national television...

21:02.995 --> 21:06.633
(sighs) ...and everything
turns upside down in a morning.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.469
I see.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.638
I'm sorry. I...

21:13.172 --> 21:14.974
I mean, Kai, what do you,
what do you want from me?

21:15.007 --> 21:17.209
I'm... I'm in love.
I'm excited.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.415
Kind of how
you're supposed to be.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.351
(exhales)
I am excited.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.418
Okay, but...?

21:25.452 --> 21:27.354
I lost two sources today.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.255
And my assignment editor
was joking that

21:29.288 --> 21:31.524
since I'm marrying a pop star,

21:31.558 --> 21:33.326
I should move
to the entertainment desk.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.328
Okay, screw him.
You up in here talking

21:35.362 --> 21:36.929
about "pop star"
like it's a damn drug dealer

21:36.963 --> 21:38.598
-or something.
-You know I didn't mean it
like that.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.166
J-Jamal.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.603
I love you.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.105
I-I just didn't think
that I'd go

21:46.138 --> 21:48.975
from telling the story
to being the story.

21:51.043 --> 21:54.013
*

21:54.046 --> 21:56.048
(yawns)

21:57.249 --> 22:00.987
(Cookie sniffs, mumbles)

22:01.020 --> 22:03.189
-Baby, it's freezing in here.
-I know.

22:03.222 --> 22:04.657
I'm trying to stay awake,
Lucious, okay?

22:04.691 --> 22:06.292
I'm trying
to work something out.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.629
-Are you all right?
-No, I am not.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.164
I-I'm trying,
but it's not working, okay?

22:12.198 --> 22:13.633
(laughs):
This...

22:13.666 --> 22:16.068
this showcase
is way over budget.

22:17.069 --> 22:20.306
Oh, I'm one step ahead of you
on that.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.209
Look, honey. Here.

22:23.242 --> 22:25.077
What's that?

22:25.111 --> 22:27.880
If we're gonna do this thing,
we can't half-ass it.

22:27.914 --> 22:31.183
I want to mortgage the house
to cover the overages.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.188
You sure you want to do this,
Lucious?

22:39.091 --> 22:43.095
If we don't bet on ourselves,
who else will?

22:47.266 --> 22:50.603
(sighs)

22:50.637 --> 22:52.639
*

22:56.108 --> 22:57.243
No.

22:57.276 --> 22:59.579
Okay, you need to move the drums

22:59.612 --> 23:01.013
from the outro to the hook.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.549
That's got a, uh...

23:02.582 --> 23:04.383
Actually, can you give me
the room?

23:04.417 --> 23:05.585
-All right.
-Thank you.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.426
(quietly):
Girl, what was that?

23:13.460 --> 23:15.261
Kingsley is completely out
of control.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.929
Lavar did not deserve that.

23:16.963 --> 23:21.133
(quietly): That was a message
to the room, okay?

23:21.167 --> 23:23.603
One slip, and any one of us
could be Lavar.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.204
But none of this makes sense.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.873
The vaulting doesn't make
any sense.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.307
You need to call your boy.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.308
-You need to call Kelly Patel.
-Shh.

23:29.341 --> 23:30.309
Get your boy on the phone.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.878
And say what?

23:31.911 --> 23:34.046
That his handpicked CEO
is a little quirky?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.548
Girl, those are tech dudes.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.149
Quirky is their default setting,
please.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.918
And I don't care nothing
about no quirky, okay?

23:38.951 --> 23:41.320
What I know is I did not
turn my back on Lucious

23:41.353 --> 23:43.089
-and Cookie just to watch
everything I built--
-Hey. Hey.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.457
-I built this bitch--
-Hey, hey, hey.

23:44.491 --> 23:45.892
to go down in the drain, no.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.561
Promise me
that you will sit tight.

23:48.595 --> 23:53.299
Oh, so now we're not making
moves all of a sudden.

23:53.332 --> 23:54.967
Are we not making moves now?

23:55.001 --> 23:56.936
Do you know something
I don't know?

23:56.969 --> 23:57.970
-You holding out on me?
-Psst.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.172
When the time is right,

24:00.206 --> 24:02.008
I will handle Kingsley.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.812
"I'll handle Kingsley," huh?

24:05.845 --> 24:08.815
Hey.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.149
Uh-uh, I'm watching you.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.450
(scoffs)

24:21.360 --> 24:22.862
Oh, hell no.

24:22.895 --> 24:26.766
Candace. Look...
we need to talk, okay?

24:26.799 --> 24:27.967
Nothing to discuss.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.202
Uh, yeah, it is.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.771
Is-Is Franklin okay?

24:31.804 --> 24:33.205
Is he home yet?

24:33.239 --> 24:36.108
There's no telling when
or if he's coming home.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.810
He's in an institution.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.312
I am so sorry, Candace. Okay?

24:40.346 --> 24:42.782
This is not how I wanted it
to turn out.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.450
Everything was happening
so fast.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.786
I was te... I was terrified.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.220
It was just one of his episodes.

24:48.254 --> 24:49.488
Th-They, they blow over.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.457
Candace, please stop.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.526
He was not himself;
he could've killed you.

24:57.163 --> 25:00.399
Have you ever called the police
on Andre?

25:00.432 --> 25:03.803
(exhales) No,
because it's different.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.705
H-He's never done that.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.340
You're right, it's different.
(scoffs)

25:08.374 --> 25:10.843
What was I thinking, what?

25:10.877 --> 25:15.982
Comparing my sweet boy to that
murderous, crazy convict?

25:16.015 --> 25:18.150
(exhales) Okay, Candace,
you're my sister,

25:18.184 --> 25:21.888
and I see you're hurting,
so let me help you.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.222
Well, do you know what I see?

25:23.255 --> 25:27.259
I see Franklin
strapped to a hospital bed.

25:27.293 --> 25:31.931
My handsome, brilliant son
pumped so full of medication

25:31.964 --> 25:35.735
that he's just drooling
all over the sheets.

25:35.768 --> 25:38.237
He doesn't even recognize me.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.239
My own son.

25:40.272 --> 25:42.041
Candace, I'm so sorry.

25:42.074 --> 25:45.344
Now you know what
that phone call did.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.179
What you did.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.015
(sighs)

25:49.048 --> 25:50.883
So you'll understand...

25:50.917 --> 25:52.384
I can't be...

26:12.304 --> 26:15.174
(song plays indistinctly
through headphones)

26:18.110 --> 26:19.879
(scoffs)

26:19.912 --> 26:21.147
Hello.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.982
Hi.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.416
What's this?

26:24.450 --> 26:26.986
Errands, because that's
what assistants do.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.054
I don't have a car.
(chuckling)

26:28.087 --> 26:30.122
Yeah, but the bus runs
until 2:00 a.m.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.391
And with some luck,
you'll make it back by then.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.627
I told you, no handouts,
no free rides.

26:34.661 --> 26:36.395
Hey, baby, don't give me
no side-eye.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.631
You want to be homeless? Huh?

26:38.665 --> 26:40.633
(Carol laughing)

26:40.667 --> 26:42.001
Up in here,
eating all my damn food.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.771
-Damn.
-Greedy ass.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.006
So, um, I heard you saw Candace.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.976
She's not ready to talk.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.644
I don't think she ever will.

26:51.678 --> 26:52.979
Just give her a minute, Cook.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.914
What you got?

26:54.947 --> 26:56.649
-I need to stay busy.
-All right.

26:56.683 --> 26:59.952
The designer
just dropped this off.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.822
Look at you, you are going
all out on this showcase, Cook.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.290
Mm-hmm, you gotta spend money
to make it, baby.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.792
(chuckling) Yeah, well,
this ice sculpture

27:05.825 --> 27:07.326
is bigger than my apartment.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.995
How are you paying for all this?

27:09.028 --> 27:12.298
Lucious mortgaged the house.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.600
And you're feeling guilty
about that, too?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.669
Yes, I'm feeling guilty.
I mean...

27:16.703 --> 27:19.138
Shouldn't I just tell Lucious
about the condo?

27:19.171 --> 27:21.874
I-I could sell it in a weekend.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.342
Cookie, if you really wanted
to sell it,

27:23.375 --> 27:26.612
you had plenty of chances,
and we both know

27:26.645 --> 27:28.715
you're holding onto that place
for a reason.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.950
Look, I know I've gone all in
with Lucious before, but...

27:30.983 --> 27:32.218
Hmm? And where'd that get you?

27:32.251 --> 27:33.720
Flat broke.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.654
Bars for a view.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.156
This time is different, Carol.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.158
Okay? Lucious and I,

27:39.191 --> 27:42.995
we're building LFM together.
Okay?

27:43.029 --> 27:45.798
We-We're making decisions
together; it's just different,

27:45.832 --> 27:48.968
and I haven't felt this way
about him in a long time.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.369
All right, Cookie.

27:50.402 --> 27:53.672
-Maybe it's different this time.
-It is.

27:53.706 --> 27:57.209
But you have gone too far down
this road to tell him right now,

27:57.243 --> 27:59.045
so why don't you just stay
focused on the showcase?

27:59.078 --> 28:02.148
When that money starts rolling
in, then you can tell him.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.750
But I gotta tell you,
if it was me,

28:03.783 --> 28:05.885
knowing the dirt
that brother did?

28:05.918 --> 28:09.588
I wouldn't say a word,
and I'd sleep like a baby.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.760
*

28:21.367 --> 28:23.102
Yo!

28:25.037 --> 28:27.907
Oh, so you got
a little posse now, huh?

28:27.940 --> 28:29.341
Tell them to vamoose.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.011
It's okay. Give us a minute.

28:32.044 --> 28:36.582
So your fans been threatening
my family, my girl, my kids.

28:36.615 --> 28:39.018
(sighs) I never told anyone
to do anything wack like that.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.853
HAKEEM:
I didn't say you did.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.688
But I wouldn't want to have
to make you stop it.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.956
Come on, 'Keem.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.759
You know I love your kids
like family.

28:46.793 --> 28:49.128
Bella's even wondering
where's her Uncle Blake at.

28:50.797 --> 28:52.131
What should I tell her?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.734
-Hmm?
-(Blake exhales)

28:55.768 --> 28:57.636
You want a drink?

28:57.669 --> 28:59.638
Why not?

29:05.577 --> 29:08.047
BLAKE: This all got crazy
over a misunderstanding.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.548
Let's start over.

29:09.581 --> 29:13.552
-I accept your apology.
-What?

29:13.585 --> 29:15.721
I'm willing to squash this,
but I'm not apologizing.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.223
Who dropped
the first diss track?

29:17.256 --> 29:18.757
Who tried to take my girl
and my song?

29:18.791 --> 29:20.459
She didn't seem like your girl
when I was cooking dinner

29:20.492 --> 29:21.660
for her and your kids.

29:21.693 --> 29:22.829
What you just say?

29:24.864 --> 29:27.599
Do you think I'm scared of you,
'Keem?

29:27.633 --> 29:29.501
'Cause I'm not.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.604
(scoffs)

29:37.009 --> 29:39.611
You scared now?

29:39.645 --> 29:42.181
Put 'em down. I got this.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.852
You better fix this.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.053
We good.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.530
You better fix this.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.800
Get the car.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.802
BIG DUDE:
Let's go.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.457
What you got?

30:25.491 --> 30:27.693
JANICE:
Tracy Ann Stanhope.

30:27.726 --> 30:29.962
But she liked the sound of her
mother's maiden name better.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.964
You're looking at
Tracy Kingsley.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.799
GISELLE:
Kingsley's mother.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.734
Teenage white girl from
the Main Line suburbs,

30:35.767 --> 30:38.804
takes the train into Philly
on the weekends to feel free.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.873
And eventually,
to start copping the drugs

30:40.907 --> 30:42.708
-that rounded out the picture.
-Okay.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.877
-And her dealer?
-Mm-hmm.

30:44.911 --> 30:47.079
A young man trying to make it
in the music game,

30:47.113 --> 30:50.883
but still slinging
to make ends meet.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.920
Lucious Lyon. (scoffs)

30:55.021 --> 30:57.856
Do the math.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.725
(Giselle gasps)

30:59.758 --> 31:02.561
Wow. So, he wasn't only
her drug dealer, was he?

31:02.594 --> 31:03.930
Mm-mm.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.032
Okay. Is she still alive?

31:06.065 --> 31:07.666
(scoffs)
Spends most her time sedated,

31:07.699 --> 31:09.068
but Kingsley visits, often.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.603
Visits? I thought I told you
to not follow him.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.072
I didn't have to.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.740
I put a tracker on his car.

31:20.812 --> 31:23.449
-Wow.
-(car door closes)

31:29.121 --> 31:31.890
Kingsley has complete control
over Empire's finances.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.725
ANDRE: We need to look at
Empire's real balance sheet.

31:33.759 --> 31:35.061
Yeah, how do we get inside?

31:35.094 --> 31:36.395
Everything is in
Kingsley's computer.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.397
Then we need to steal
his computer.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.532
No, I bet he's using
military grade encryption.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.734
Ah, then we need someone
on the inside.

31:43.802 --> 31:45.371
What about Giselle?

31:45.404 --> 31:46.438
Do you trust her?

31:46.472 --> 31:47.906
Do we have a choice?

31:49.441 --> 31:52.444
There may be one other option.

31:56.015 --> 31:59.651
* How do you expect for me
to act like that? *

31:59.685 --> 32:02.721
* When you're doing
the same things too *

32:02.754 --> 32:03.922
(sighs)

32:03.956 --> 32:06.492
* How do you want me...

32:06.525 --> 32:08.394
-(Becky sighs)
-THIRSTY: Ms. Williams.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.928
Why am I here, Thirsty?

32:09.962 --> 32:11.930
Sit down.

32:11.964 --> 32:15.067
-Come on. Scooch. (chuckling)
-(sighs)

32:15.101 --> 32:17.003
-You look good.
-Thank you.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.404
I stopped eating carbs.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.307
I see. (chuckling)

32:21.340 --> 32:24.310
Why am I here?

32:24.343 --> 32:26.812
We need your help, Becky.
It's Kingsley.

32:26.845 --> 32:30.516
(scoffs) You know "we" means
Lucious and Cookie, right?

32:30.549 --> 32:32.818
A distinction
without a difference.

32:32.851 --> 32:34.086
No, no, no.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.988
There are five of them, okay?

32:36.022 --> 32:37.756
And there will always be.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.858
Lucious and Cookie love
the word "family,"

32:39.891 --> 32:43.362
but you gotta know that doesn't
apply to you and me.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.331
And I've worked way too hard
at Empire

32:45.364 --> 32:47.766
to jeopardize it
for your little family.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.935
So, no.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.937
Look, look, I respect that.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.273
But you riddle me this.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.941
So, you're Head A&R at Empire,
right?

32:55.974 --> 32:57.343
Everything that you wanted

32:57.376 --> 32:58.710
and worked for
your entire career.

32:58.744 --> 33:01.480
But once Kingsley vaults
their music,

33:01.513 --> 33:03.715
you run straight to Cookie
and Lucious and tell them.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.384
Why?

33:05.417 --> 33:06.785
Because...

33:06.818 --> 33:08.787
Eh...

33:08.820 --> 33:10.456
Yeah... that's not an answer.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.990
That wasn't even
a complete sentence.

33:13.892 --> 33:16.362
(sighs)
What do you want me to do?

33:17.396 --> 33:20.332
This... this is what we want.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.303
We need you to get
into Kingsley's office,

33:24.336 --> 33:25.471
slip that into his computer,

33:25.504 --> 33:27.473
then you're out of there,
lickety-split.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.974
(whispering):
Are you serious?

33:29.007 --> 33:31.210
Do you know what
you're asking me to do?

33:31.243 --> 33:33.212
I'm sor... Yes, I know
what I'm asking you to do.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.546
All right? That'll log
Kingsley's password

33:34.580 --> 33:37.716
and transmit it straight
to the mansion, so that Andre

33:37.749 --> 33:40.586
can get into
Empire's financials.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.521
Look, this is our shot,
Grasshopper.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.290
It's time to choose a side.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.599
*

34:09.548 --> 34:11.617
(door opens in distance)

34:13.585 --> 34:15.287
(mumbles)

34:16.455 --> 34:19.191
You looking for something?

34:19.225 --> 34:20.792
-(stamps foot)
-Mm-hmm.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.928
My year-end bonus.

34:22.961 --> 34:25.264
It just-- poof--

34:25.297 --> 34:27.733
-disappeared.
-You're mad about the vaulting.

34:30.936 --> 34:33.439
Just so you know...

34:33.472 --> 34:35.274
it's about more than just money.

34:35.307 --> 34:39.545
It's about all the years
I went undervalued here.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.813
I actually had credits
on those albums, Jeff.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.716
I know exactly
what it feels like not to get

34:44.750 --> 34:46.285
the recognition you deserve.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.720
I appreciate you
not going over to LFM.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.222
I know Lucious made
some overtures.

34:50.256 --> 34:51.657
Yeah. More than once.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.459
Which is exactly why I'm here

34:53.492 --> 34:55.461
fighting for what's mine.

34:55.494 --> 34:58.330
There you go.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.803
-Damn it!
-Whoops.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.472
I think you dropped something.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.574
(giggling):
Yeah, I... I know.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.242
I'm just so clumsy.

35:10.276 --> 35:13.312
You know, Becky, Empire
is expanding exponentially,

35:13.345 --> 35:15.647
and you're a big part of that.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.317
I admit that some of my methods
are unorthodox, but you did

35:18.350 --> 35:19.618
the smart thing
by riding with me.

35:19.651 --> 35:23.622
And your loyalty
will not go unrewarded.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.558
That's why I'm doubling
your salary.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.761
What?

35:29.795 --> 35:32.498
That's really generous of you.

35:32.531 --> 35:33.632
It's well deserved.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.267
Couple of extra zeroes
every week

35:35.301 --> 35:37.102
should make the Lyons
a distant memory, right?

35:37.135 --> 35:38.770
(scoffs)
Who?

35:38.804 --> 35:40.439
(both laugh)

35:40.472 --> 35:43.775
Well, you and I are allies,
so as long as you

35:43.809 --> 35:46.612
have my back,
I'm always gonna have yours.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.113
Deal.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.682
I'm gonna get out of your hair.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.624
See you in the morning.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.858
All right.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.796
LUCIOUS:
That's what you got to do that.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.866
THIRSTY: I'm telling you,
Becky's gonna make it happen.

36:07.899 --> 36:10.135
Pop.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.870
I think I found something.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.772
Finally.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.244
-What do we got?
-There's some hidden files here.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.045
K-Kingsley's been busy.

36:20.078 --> 36:22.214
-Yeah, but what is it?
-You're not gonna believe this,

36:22.248 --> 36:24.583
Pop, but, um, Empire has
a new revenue source:

36:24.616 --> 36:27.052
the United States government.

36:27.085 --> 36:29.355
-THIRSTY: What?
-He's been working
with the Feds?

36:29.388 --> 36:31.223
-Wh-Where does it say that?
-He's selling

36:31.257 --> 36:33.058
Empire's customer data--
it's right here.

36:33.091 --> 36:34.326
That son of a bitch!

36:34.360 --> 36:35.761
So we go... we go public.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.729
Tell everybody what
this giga-bitch is up to.

36:37.763 --> 36:40.198
Can't do that. It can't look
like it's coming from us,

36:40.232 --> 36:42.401
'cause it's gonna look like
this is about personal gain.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.836
You're right, Pop.
In order for this to work,

36:44.870 --> 36:47.539
the story has to come
from a legit news source.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.575
*

36:54.145 --> 36:55.281
What?

36:55.314 --> 36:56.748
You got something?

36:56.782 --> 36:59.385
Basically,
Kingsley has changed the terms

36:59.418 --> 37:03.389
of the service agreement
for XStream users.

37:03.422 --> 37:06.458
He's abusing that information.

37:06.492 --> 37:09.194
So Empire is... is data-mining?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.597
No, it's more insidious
than that.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.600
He's selling it to...
to law enforcement.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.035
-Wait, what?
-LUCIOUS: Empire users,

37:17.068 --> 37:19.271
most of which are minorities,

37:19.305 --> 37:21.707
are being tracked in real time.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.376
Wait. Where'd you get this?

37:24.410 --> 37:25.477
I can't say that.

37:25.511 --> 37:27.746
But the XStream app
turns every phone

37:27.779 --> 37:30.649
-into a listening device.
-If this gets out to the public,

37:30.682 --> 37:32.384
you could benefit personally.

37:32.418 --> 37:33.619
I know that.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.454
That's not why I'm doing this.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.289
That was my company.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.057
Those people trusted me.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.759
They trusted my family.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.461
Dad, I-I completely
understand that.

37:42.494 --> 37:45.431
Um, I just think that Kai...

37:45.464 --> 37:47.633
he doesn't need to get involved
with this whole messiness.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.301
No, no, Jamal.

37:49.335 --> 37:51.470
I'm in.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.639
Baby, you don't have to prove
that you're some heavyweight

37:53.672 --> 37:55.173
just 'cause you're with me.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.408
It's not about that.

37:56.442 --> 37:58.009
Besides, your father is right.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.145
This is a massive breach
of public trust.

38:00.178 --> 38:02.314
I mean, look, it's right here
inside the documents, Mal.

38:02.348 --> 38:07.285
I mean, you can see
the money transfers, everything.

38:07.319 --> 38:08.987
I'm gonna warn you,
I'm gonna follow

38:09.020 --> 38:10.522
this story wherever it leads.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.223
I wouldn't expect anything less.

38:14.159 --> 38:15.527
Let's get to work.

38:18.697 --> 38:21.467
-Good evening.
-Hi.
-Mr. Kingsley.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.141
What up?

38:32.243 --> 38:34.212
Oh, please, come in.

38:35.381 --> 38:37.616
You know what's so funny?

38:37.649 --> 38:39.985
Your birth certificate
doesn't list a father.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.354
Hmm. But wouldn't you know it?

38:42.388 --> 38:45.156
Your mother lived in Philly

38:45.190 --> 38:47.058
and hung out with Lucious Lyon

38:47.092 --> 38:49.127
right around the time
you were born.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.329
-Look, Giselle...
-Oh, don't worry, I'm not here

38:51.363 --> 38:53.499
to talk about all
your past daddy issues, Jeff.

38:53.532 --> 38:57.636
But I am here to talk
about your present...

38:57.669 --> 38:59.371
and my future.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.340
Oh, she can't hear us.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.881
I saw the plans
on the kitchen table.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.583
Do you think it's too much?

39:11.617 --> 39:14.553
No, I think you are handling
this event like a boss.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.055
-Hmm.
-Oh, the line of credit

39:17.088 --> 39:18.557
came through for the mortgage,

39:18.590 --> 39:21.259
so we're gonna be able
to put on the showcase

39:21.292 --> 39:24.262
like Lyon Family Management
is supposed to.

39:24.295 --> 39:26.398
-(doorbell rings)
-I know...

39:26.432 --> 39:29.568
two years since we lost Empire,

39:29.601 --> 39:32.270
but we're so close
to getting everything back.

39:32.303 --> 39:34.272
I mean, just you and me

39:34.305 --> 39:36.041
-working together.
-I know.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.676
Ms. Cookie, Mr. Lucious,

39:37.709 --> 39:39.077
Ms. Candace is here.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.212
Oh. Hey, Candace.

39:41.246 --> 39:44.416
Um... how's Franklin?

39:44.450 --> 39:46.284
-A little better today.
-Good.

39:46.317 --> 39:47.419
Why don't you stay for...

39:47.453 --> 39:49.387
-dinner?
-No, thank you.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.289
I only have a minute, Lucious.

39:51.322 --> 39:54.025
I'm glad you came, Candace.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.027
Don't get ahead
of yourself, Cookie.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.430
You turned my family
upside down.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.299
I've come to return the favor.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.307
"256 Mercer."

40:09.340 --> 40:10.876
-(Cookie gasps softly)
-LUCIOUS: What's this?

40:10.909 --> 40:12.911
CANDACE:
Cookie's little secret.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.548
Wait a minute, your name...

40:16.582 --> 40:18.249
is on the deed of trust.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.953
You own this place?

40:21.987 --> 40:23.889
Look, Candace,
I know you're upset,

40:23.922 --> 40:25.390
but this, this ain't right.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.258
$4 million in equity

40:27.292 --> 40:28.960
and one foot out the door.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.497
There's your ride-or-die,
Lucious.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.409
You let me go out there and...

40:44.442 --> 40:46.444
risk everything...

40:46.478 --> 40:49.447
and you had this the whole time?

40:49.481 --> 40:51.950
*

40:54.352 --> 40:56.522
All you had to do
was go over there

40:56.555 --> 40:58.356
and squash this beef with Blake.

40:58.389 --> 41:00.959
But you just
couldn't do that, could you?

41:00.992 --> 41:04.830
Why would you let that man in
my house when I wasn't around?

41:04.863 --> 41:06.598
Hakeem,
Blake was a friend, okay?

41:06.632 --> 41:09.267
I had two kids-- two!--

41:09.300 --> 41:12.037
-while you were who-knows-where.
-Okay.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.439
Tee, you let him
touch up on you like that?

41:14.472 --> 41:16.441
This is sad.
Now you're just trippin'.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.777
Nah, what's sad is that
you needed somebody to be there

41:18.810 --> 41:20.178
for your little stupid ass, huh?

41:20.211 --> 41:21.813
You a bird, Tee.

41:21.847 --> 41:24.449
-Juanita! Get Bella ready!
-I don't know where

41:24.482 --> 41:26.818
-you're going with my son.
-Get out of my way.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.987
Don't stand over my son
like that. Move.

41:29.020 --> 41:32.123
Besides, Bella's not even yours.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.826
You don't act like
she's yours, either.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.797
And you know I love that little
girl like she's my own. Stupid.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.232
Blake was right about your ass.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.801
You don't love me.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.203
-Wha...
-We sat here with no AC,

41:45.236 --> 41:48.907
sweating our asses to death,
almost down to our last dollar,

41:48.940 --> 41:52.410
and you could have bailed us out
at any moment?

41:52.443 --> 41:55.714
Whatever happened
to not keeping secrets?

41:55.747 --> 41:57.048
That is not true.

41:57.082 --> 41:59.150
I do love you.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.187
But don't sit here and try
to rewrite history, Lucious.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.355
You've done some things, okay?

42:04.389 --> 42:07.092
Things other women
would never forgive.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.394
-Then why did you marry me?
-Because I do love you.

42:09.427 --> 42:11.029
I always have,

42:11.062 --> 42:13.031
-even when I wanted
to hate your ass!
-That's a lie!

42:13.064 --> 42:15.834
If you did, you would've
told me about this!

42:15.867 --> 42:17.235
I was scared!

42:17.268 --> 42:18.904
Can't you understand?

42:18.937 --> 42:20.405
This is about trust.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.073
Trust?

42:22.107 --> 42:26.177
This is all I need to know
about trust.

42:26.211 --> 42:27.445
Okay.

42:27.478 --> 42:31.382
You want to know
why I kept that condo?

42:31.416 --> 42:34.252
It's not because
I couldn't trust you.

42:34.285 --> 42:36.187
It's because I couldn't trust

42:36.221 --> 42:38.724
that I would
protect myself from you.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.793
Protect?
(grunts)

42:41.827 --> 42:43.795
Protect yourself from me? Okay.

42:43.829 --> 42:45.363
Where are you going?

42:45.396 --> 42:47.933
All of this--
LFM, the showcase,

42:47.966 --> 42:49.935
everything we did
for the last two years!

42:49.968 --> 42:52.037
Wait, Lucious!
What are you doing!?

42:52.070 --> 42:53.404
It's for nothing!

42:53.438 --> 42:55.373
This painting is a fake!

42:55.406 --> 42:59.410
-What?!
-I sold the real one,
'cause we needed the money!

42:59.444 --> 43:02.313
-Stop it, Lucious! Stop it!
-Everything we did was a lie!

43:02.347 --> 43:04.149
All of our relationship
has been a lie!

43:04.182 --> 43:06.284
TIANA: Put your hands on me
again and see what happens.

43:06.317 --> 43:07.719
-You ain't goin' nowhere
with my kid!
-Juanita! Juanita!

43:07.753 --> 43:08.920
-Give me my son back!
-Shut up.

43:08.954 --> 43:10.388
Hey, give me my son back!

43:10.421 --> 43:12.057
-What is going on?
-Hey, Ma, mind your business.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.424
-Hey, boy, this is my house!
-(Lucious shouting)

43:13.458 --> 43:16.394
Hey, Tata, Tata, Tata,
look what I found.

43:16.427 --> 43:17.763
Oh, my God.

43:19.197 --> 43:20.932
Bella, come here.

43:20.966 --> 43:23.001
-LUCIOUS: Bella...
-(gasps)

43:24.269 --> 43:26.304
-Bella, baby...
-LUCIOUS: Baby,
put the gun down.

43:26.337 --> 43:28.373
TIANA: Put it down. (gasps)
-LUCIOUS: Baby...

43:37.683 --> 43:40.686

44:09.414 --> 44:11.549
Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

44:11.582 --> 44:13.885
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:16.021 --> 44:17.222
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:19.557 --> 44:21.893
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:21.927 --> 44:25.496
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

44:25.530 --> 44:29.067
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:29.100 --> 44:30.135
MAN: Touchdown!

44:30.168 --> 44:33.705
* Reach out *

44:33.739 --> 44:37.342
* Make this right here
right now *

44:37.375 --> 44:40.278
* Stand up *

44:41.179 --> 44:42.914
* Here right now *

44:42.948 --> 44:44.916
That sounds like fun.
