01:11.822 --> 01:12.947
Wait, don't look.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.324
I hate this shit.
- Keep them closed!

01:16.493 --> 01:18.703
Drama, hit me again and I'm gonna
beat the shit out of you.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.246
- Turtle did it.
- Bullshit.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.165
I can smell your Lagerfeld-doused fingers.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.834
- Make a right, right here.
- Where we going?

01:25.002 --> 01:27.628
Hold on, take a step now, step.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.338
Okay, here we come.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.923
Steady.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.468
Almost there.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.511
Ready and...

01:35.596 --> 01:36.846
Open!

01:37.181 --> 01:38.765
Holy shit!

01:39.600 --> 01:42.143
You bought another $100,000 car,
you sick maniac?

01:42.227 --> 01:43.770
No, it's not for me, it's for you.

01:45.647 --> 01:46.606
It's for me?

01:46.690 --> 01:49.442
Big day for E. Brand new Maserati,

01:49.526 --> 01:50.860
and you're gonna pop your cherry tonight.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.030
For your big date with Kristen,
you're gonna need a nice car.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.867
When finally fucking your own girlfriend,
one should travel in style.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.829
God, this is so sweet.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.247
You're gonna love it.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.167
I had an Italian sports car in '94.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.668
They're a delight.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.963
- You had a Fiat, Drama.
- Italian, none the less.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.674
- I can't take this, Vince.
- I'll take it.

02:13.759 --> 02:18.012
E, you've made $6,000 since
you've been my manager.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.264
You're getting killed. I feel bad.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.141
Do you think this is the right time
to be doing this?

02:22.226 --> 02:24.393
We don't even know when
the next pay day is coming.

02:24.937 --> 02:27.063
You always got to ruin everything?

02:27.272 --> 02:29.524
All right, fine, they gave it to me.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.818
- Who gave it to you?
- Beverly Hills Maserati.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.069
I hooked it up.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.780
All they want is for Vince
to be seen riding around town.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.574
Please don't make me beg
you to take a free Maserati.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.661
They gave you this car so you
could be seen driving around in it.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.663
That's why I'm gonna roll down
the window and stick my head out

02:43.747 --> 02:45.623
and you're gonna drive us to the Laker game.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.922
Oh, look at that! That's not a foul?

02:53.006 --> 02:54.966
Whatever they are paying you, I'll double it.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.801
Ed, talk to your boy, he's gone crazy.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.970
When was the last time you made a good call?
11 years ago?

02:59.054 --> 03:00.221
Unbelievable!

03:00.305 --> 03:01.931
You gotta focus up.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.850
I don't know what you're doing,
but you're killing me.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.606
Lamar Odom's got great calves, huh?

03:13.151 --> 03:14.569
What? He doesn't?

03:16.321 --> 03:18.155
Yeah, Lamar!

03:18.615 --> 03:20.283
Way to go, baby, way to go!

03:20.659 --> 03:22.034
Big night tonight, huh, E?

03:22.119 --> 03:25.037
You're like a high school girl, Ari,
the way you gossip.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.206
- You nervous?
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.833
I'm saying I'd be nervous.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.835
Three months your girl's
been glorifying how you perform.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.212
And what if you don't live up to the memory?

03:35.799 --> 03:37.300
What? We're not talking?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.386
Please. Who's not talking?
I'm watching the game.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.139
- Besides, didn't you fire me?
- I fired you?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.390
You're gonna let him interpret?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.142
- He doesn't even speak the language.
- Oh, gosh.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.312
- What did he say again?
- "Do Aquaman or find a new agent. "

03:49.646 --> 03:50.855
That's what I recall.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.440
Fuck yeah!

03:53.317 --> 03:55.651
Get up. Come on, I paid for the seats. Get up.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.862
- Unbelievable.
- Down in front!

03:57.946 --> 03:59.614
I paid two grand for these seats.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.991
I'll get out there and launch a three if I want!

04:03.327 --> 04:04.493
All right, look.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.330
I'm making some moves for you. I am.
We've got some bites.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.999
- Don't throw away the idea of "Aquaman. "
- Ari!

04:10.375 --> 04:11.542
The script is coming in tomorrow.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.920
I don't want to end up doing the same role
for the rest of my life.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.838
He doesn't want to get typecast!

04:16.089 --> 04:18.214
Look it. There's "The Joker. "
There's "Batman. "

04:18.300 --> 04:20.927
There's "Spider-Man. "
They're all typecast as rich guys.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.346
Listen, for me, just read the script.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.806
If it's not great,
you'll never hear about it again.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.308
- I promise.
- I'll read the script.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.478
But if I don't like it and you mention it again,
I'm gonna fire you.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.772
You want me to interpret that for you, Ari?

04:35.859 --> 04:38.527
Wow, that sucks.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.530
I can't believe that.

04:42.783 --> 04:46.744
No, no, I understand. I just...
I really wanted to see you.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.955
No, I understand.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.665
You need anything?

04:51.959 --> 04:53.209
- Vince!
- Yo!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.543
- What's up, Lamar?
- What's up, baby?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.253
- Great game.
- Thanks, man. Good seeing you.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.714
- When you gonna do a new movie?
- Soon, man, soon.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.551
Hey, Lamar.
What do you do for your legs, man?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.720
- What?
- How do you get them looking so good?

05:04.805 --> 05:07.306
- Vince, your brother's a freak.
- True.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.392
- Later, man.
- See you, bro.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.394
Johnny, what's up with you and the legs?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.104
He thinks his are too thin.

05:13.730 --> 05:17.483
I'm reading for Point Dume tomorrow.
I'm a little stressed.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.902
I'd be more concerned about your face.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.239
The Chase men all have great legs.
Don't forget it.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.949
No, you're lucky.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.951
You got your mom's calves. I got Dad's.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.245
Vinnie Chase, Jaime Pressly.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.247
Hey. How are you?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.373
Good. How are you?

05:32.457 --> 05:35.001
I'm mad at you.
We were supposed to work together.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.337
You passed on Torque. Remember, baby?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.090
Hey, there's always Torque II.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.135
So what are you up to these days?

05:44.219 --> 05:45.428
Glad you asked.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.097
I am doing a pet project.

05:48.432 --> 05:50.975
I'm gonna have a party at my house
at the beach tonight.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.685
If you guys want to come by,
I can tell you about it.

05:52.769 --> 05:53.978
Of course.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.188
- You're kind of invited, too.
- Thank you.

05:56.273 --> 06:00.568
I would love to show up,
but it's anal sex night at the Gold house.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.195
Thank you for the invite.
I'm gonna go punish my wife.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.280
- That's nice.
- Good luck, everybody.

06:04.364 --> 06:09.201
- Oh, E! Jaime Pressly's beach party, kid!
- Yeah!

06:09.327 --> 06:11.620
- I forgot. You can't come.
- Shut up, Turtle.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.414
- This could be off the hook.
- What's the matter?

06:13.498 --> 06:14.832
Kristen's got food poisoning.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.961
- No. You're coming to this party.
- Nah, drop me off at home.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.213
It's on the complete opposite side of town!

06:21.298 --> 06:24.091
Don't be such a fucking pussy!

06:24.176 --> 06:26.052
You know how much gas a Maserati burns?

06:26.136 --> 06:27.386
Come on.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.139
Oh, he goes to the hoop.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.749
This is a great party!

06:56.833 --> 07:00.836
But we decided if you're gonna be miserable,
we're gonna be miserable too.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.964
Just for the record, I voted against you, E,
but I went with the majority.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.468
I'm not miserable.
I'm pissed, I got stuck with a $400 hotel room.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.429
Peninsula has a 24-hour cancellation policy.

07:10.514 --> 07:14.183
You should at least go jerk off on the bed.
You gotta pay for it.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.227
Let me get this straight.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.855
She convinces you to get
these extravagant accommodations

07:19.940 --> 07:21.857
and then she bails?

07:22.234 --> 07:24.860
She didn't bail. She got sick.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.446
Before the date. Unlike your girls,
who get sick when they arrive.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.201
Right, right.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.537
You don't believe her?

07:35.205 --> 07:37.123
I didn't buy the period.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.707
Yeah, I didn't either.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.379
You, too?

07:44.506 --> 07:46.215
Don't beat around the bush anymore.

07:46.550 --> 07:49.760
The three of us can't stand her.
Okay? We never could.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.762
Really?

07:52.097 --> 07:53.514
I don't like the way she treats you.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.057
Face facts, E.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.726
She didn't come to New York.
One day she got her period.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.979
Next day she got food poisoning.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.648
She's fucking somebody else.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.404
Easy, Turtle. That's my girlfriend.

08:13.743 --> 08:14.743
Christ.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.120
Look at the tree trunks on that guy.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.082
Catch you guys later.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.340
Hey!

08:29.926 --> 08:33.511
So, I don't get it. It's a "spec-telethon"?

08:33.597 --> 08:36.182
Yeah, you know,
like Jerry Lewis does for M.S.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.725
But for dogs?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.268
Yeah, you like dogs, don't you?

08:39.352 --> 08:42.479
Well, of course.
I just didn't know they had M.S.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.399
Well, they do, and we can help them.

08:46.401 --> 08:49.195
Imagine if we hosted it together.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.946
How hot would that be?

08:51.823 --> 08:54.783
- Quite. Yeah.
- So, will you do it?

08:55.118 --> 08:56.452
Sure, of course.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.537
I just have to talk to my people.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.541
Dogs need people to talk for them.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.710
Sorry to interrupt you guys.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.378
Oh, there's my people now.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.422
I'm gonna grab a cab.
Thank you very much. See you.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.882
- Wait. No!
- Yeah.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.342
E, come on, hang out.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.302
I don't want to. I'm tired, I want to go home.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.430
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- Okay. Yo, everybody!

09:16.514 --> 09:17.723
- Stop, stop!
- Listen up!

09:17.807 --> 09:20.517
My friend here E is trying to bounce!

09:20.602 --> 09:22.895
Could you convince him to stay, maybe?

09:24.481 --> 09:26.106
Leanna, Leanna!

09:26.483 --> 09:28.817
- Have you met my boy, E?
- No. Hi.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.488
- Nice to meet you.
- Leanna is a Perfect 10 model.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.282
You know what that means, "Au naturel. "

09:35.408 --> 09:36.533
Can you believe that, with those tits?

09:36.660 --> 09:38.786
Oh my God, E's "au naturel" too.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.663
He wants to leave. Can you believe that?

09:40.789 --> 09:42.539
- Why?
- I'm just tired.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.832
Want to go home and go to sleep.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.001
That's too bad.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.504
So, what is it you do, E?

09:49.798 --> 09:51.590
Well, I work with Vince a little bit.

09:51.675 --> 09:54.051
- Very cool.
- He works with me. He's my manager.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.887
He runs my life. I'd be nowhere without him.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.347
Even cooler.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.641
Come on, I'll take care of you,

10:00.809 --> 10:02.851
make sure nothing bad happens.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.774
- Thanks.
- Nice work.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.611
I work with Vince a lot.
I take care of whatever he needs.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.405
Like a gopher?

10:14.531 --> 10:17.866
No, sweetheart. It's more like a manager.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.786
Why, you looking for representation?

10:30.797 --> 10:31.880
What's up?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.052
You keep staring. What's up?

10:38.722 --> 10:40.723
Oh, I was just...

10:42.767 --> 10:44.101
Can I ask you a question?

10:44.185 --> 10:45.352
Yeah, what?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.732
Are those real? Or are they implants?

10:51.192 --> 10:52.443
What?

10:52.694 --> 10:54.486
Your calves, bro.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.030
What, are you joking?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.616
Okay, keep it to yourself.

10:59.743 --> 11:03.287
But if you're telling me they're real,
I ain't buying it.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.249
Hers neither.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.336
All I'm saying is that
from a girl's point of view,

11:10.420 --> 11:11.545
if she wanted to see you,

11:11.629 --> 11:14.256
she would've asked you
to bring her some soup.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.846
So, what kind of dog is your dog?

11:21.056 --> 11:23.015
He's a Rottweiler. He's beautiful.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.727
Oh, yeah, that's not gonna work.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.354
You know what?

11:28.605 --> 11:34.443
Maybe we can get you like a Chihuahua,
and we'll pretend like that's your dog. Perfect!

11:35.320 --> 11:36.862
Good thing she ain't driving home.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.405
Let's go swimming.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.449
Are you kidding? It's fucking freezing.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.409
- I'll keep you warm.
- Really?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.119
- Absolutely.
- Promise?

11:44.329 --> 11:46.038
- Live a little, come on!
- Okay.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.874
- Let's go swimming!
Are you out of your mind?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.668
Come on, Vince's manager!

11:52.504 --> 11:54.129
Oh, it's on, baby!

11:57.300 --> 11:58.467
Come on.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.266
Come on, E.

12:06.351 --> 12:10.854
Even if she still is your girlfriend,
it's not cheating if you're not in love.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.654
Just don't fall in love with me, okay?

12:23.410 --> 12:24.451
You coming?

12:25.120 --> 12:28.330
No, have fun, bro.
I don't want anyone to see my legs.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.345
Hello.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.097
Hey! Are you up?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.226
Yeah, barely.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.728
I feel so much better. I want to see you.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.190
Now?

12:55.733 --> 12:59.027
- It's 7:30 in the morning.
- Check out is not till noon.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.779
I called. Meet me over there.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.866
No! I'm not allowed to go to the Peninsula.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.369
I had a fight with them last night
and I'm gonna dispute the charges.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.456
- Oh, well, meet me here then.
- You know what, I can't.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.957
I got a crazy morning.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.751
God, I thought you were dying to see me.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.920
Well, I am.

13:17.672 --> 13:21.383
My last class is at 3:00.
Pick me up outside the James building.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.220
Hello?

13:25.388 --> 13:26.472
Yeah.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.056
Are you okay?

13:28.766 --> 13:32.102
Yeah, I'm okay. See you at 3:00.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.520
Okay.

13:33.605 --> 13:37.357
I'm sorry about last night. I miss you.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.860
Miss you, too.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.906
- Girlfriend?
- Yep.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.533
Who's Rob? Your boyfriend?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.452
How did you guess?

13:49.704 --> 13:50.704
I gotta go.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.956
Oh, please.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.629
I've never been with a guy that
didn't want to fuck me again in the morning.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.346
- Deny till you die.
- That's all I'm saying.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.307
"I don't know what you're talking about.
It never happened. "

14:10.433 --> 14:11.642
E, look at me.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.394
"Kristen, I've never cheated on you in my life. "

14:14.729 --> 14:16.647
- That was good, right, Vince?
- Yeah, excellent.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.273
- Very believable.
- E?

14:18.608 --> 14:20.275
I'd work on your audition, Drama.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.028
It's not gonna be about the acting,
bro, trust me.

14:27.158 --> 14:30.118
Sir, could you please
take your hands off the mirror?

14:32.038 --> 14:33.247
What do you think?

14:33.331 --> 14:36.416
Nothing says "I cheated" more
than an expensive piece ofjewelry.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.168
I'm gonna tell her, so what's the difference?

14:38.253 --> 14:39.545
No!

14:39.629 --> 14:41.046
Let's hope she forgives me.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.422
Don't you listen to a word we say?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.883
I agree with these guys.
You're making a mistake.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.052
All this coming from a guy
who's never had a relationship

14:47.136 --> 14:48.470
that's lasted longer than a week.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.305
What, and that's an insult?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.725
You tell someone you cheated
if you want to break up with them.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.228
Otherwise, it's a selfish way
to get rid of your guilt.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.646
- Well said.
- Thank you.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.648
You tell her, she'll never trust you again.

14:59.774 --> 15:02.734
If you want to stay with Kristen,
you keep your mouth shut,

15:02.819 --> 15:04.194
- and you don't do it again.
- Exactly.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.237
None of this would have happened

15:05.321 --> 15:07.573
if you guys didn't put it
in my head she was cheating.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.116
Don't blame us 'cause you're weak!

15:09.200 --> 15:10.909
I'll take the blame for last night,

15:10.994 --> 15:13.412
but you banging her again this morning.
That's on you.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.831
Who said I did?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.543
- What?
- She was really hot.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.462
- So?
- She was the hottest girl you ever been with.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.506
- Ever.
- Kristen's not hot?

15:24.674 --> 15:29.386
Kristen's cute in that "I want to marry you
so I can divorce you some day" way.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.222
But that girl last night, she could start wars.

15:32.515 --> 15:35.225
She was Vince hot.
You ain't never had Vince hot.

15:35.310 --> 15:38.312
Vince and I used to compete for girls
in high school. He didn't always win.

15:38.605 --> 15:42.024
I let him have Gina DeBernardo
when he got cut from the baseball team.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.610
Take away your fame,
we're still competing and you know it.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.571
Either way, no girls in high school
were that hot.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.032
So just tell us.
Did you fuck her this morning or not?

15:55.371 --> 15:57.539
- How much is this one?
- It's $1,400.

15:58.875 --> 15:59.958
Okay, I'll take it.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.210
- He fucked her.
- Definitely.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.137
- Hey, Ari.
- Where are you guys? I gotta see you now.

16:12.221 --> 16:15.265
I got gold in my hands, baby. Fucking gold.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.725
We're on our way to Burke Williams.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.729
Say the words "Chiang Kai-Shek. "

16:20.813 --> 16:22.397
You will get a happy ending. I'm not kidding.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.066
I'll be right there.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.692
- He's meeting us.
- Why?

16:25.777 --> 16:26.985
I have no idea.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.321
Turtle, roll with me. Come on.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.740
As usual, I get fucked out of the steam.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.917
So you're done with that girl?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.877
Of course, I'm done with her.
It was a one-night mistake.

16:43.961 --> 16:47.422
- You're not gonna call her again?
- I'm not gonna call her.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.549
Interesting.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.927
I think I'm gonna call her.

16:54.514 --> 16:59.101
"I'm like the tide, baby.
I come and go as I please. "

17:00.395 --> 17:04.356
Okay, that was great, Johnny. Really great.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.273
We just need to see the legs now.

17:19.454 --> 17:20.955
You're not fucking calling her.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.582
What are you being so territorial about?

17:22.666 --> 17:24.542
- She has a boyfriend.
- That's sweet.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.211
You should buy him expensive jewelry.

17:26.295 --> 17:30.549
"Fade in. Arthur Curry, a. k.a. Aquaman,
the heir to the throne of Poseidon,

17:30.633 --> 17:33.760
"is being placed gently
on a barrier reef by his father. "

17:33.845 --> 17:35.303
- You're kidding me?
- I'm not kidding.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.724
I'm gonna read this entire script.
You know why? It's that good.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.475
Andrew Kevin Walker wrote it.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.478
- The guy who wrote Seven?
- Yeah.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.064
Anyone who puts Gwyneth's head
in a box is okay by me.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.567
Still bitter, huh? After all these years?

17:48.651 --> 17:50.277
You know what? I fired her.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.404
"As Arthur's father stares into his son's eyes,

17:52.655 --> 17:55.615
- "he pours the Serum X... "
- Ari, we'll read it.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.367
- You're gonna read it tonight?
I'll read it.

17:57.452 --> 17:58.827
- You promise?
- I promise.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.036
You're not lying to me?

18:00.121 --> 18:01.663
I said I'll read it, I'll read it.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.457
Because it would be a very big lie.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.835
And one lie begets another,
and it's a slippery slope.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.422
- You fucking told him?
- I didn't tell him.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.048
- Jaime told me.
- Jaime told him.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.925
You commit to do the dog telethon?

18:14.927 --> 18:17.095
I wouldn't exactly call it a commitment.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.221
Will you watch your boy?

18:18.306 --> 18:21.099
It does not help his career
to do 24 hours on the "Animal Planet. "

18:21.184 --> 18:23.727
And by the way, E, I happen to know Leanna.

18:23.853 --> 18:27.814
My God, she is way too hot for you, man.
What'd you roofy her up?

18:27.982 --> 18:29.816
I didn't know you had it in you.

18:29.901 --> 18:32.110
Honestly, I don't. I'm sick over it.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.405
He bought Kristen jewelry
and he's confessing tonight.

18:35.490 --> 18:39.075
No confessions. Did you read the papers,
you idiot? Did you hear about this guy?

18:39.160 --> 18:41.536
He confessed to a murder
in 1973 with no clues.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.872
They're gonna give him 25 years.
Shut your mouth.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.626
Do not say a word, or you will end up
being gang-banged by a bunch of cholos.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.211
Just relax. It's Hollywood, baby.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.797
- Everyone strays sometimes.
- Does your wife?

18:52.882 --> 18:54.216
That's the mother of my kids.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.675
Don't be an asshole.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.154
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey.

19:20.743 --> 19:21.993
Wanna get a cup of coffee?

19:22.078 --> 19:25.455
No. I want to go straight to my apartment.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.011
Three months is a long time to be away, huh?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.763
It's not that long.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.265
Really?

19:43.349 --> 19:46.268
'Cause I was starting to feel
like this was never gonna happen.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.603
Why wouldn't this happen?

19:49.146 --> 19:51.731
Well, you know, the period.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.776
And you not coming to see me in New York.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.278
I don't know.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.489
I felt like everything was working against us.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.450
The guys were convinced
you were blowing me off.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.328
You're 28 years old.

20:05.454 --> 20:09.708
Do you have to listen to everything
that Peter Pan and the Lost Boys have to say?

20:09.792 --> 20:12.544
No, but they can be persuasive.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.462
And then you got food poisoning.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.966
What? You don't think I had food poisoning?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.676
No, I believe you, I'm just saying,

20:19.760 --> 20:22.429
my friends thought it was a little,
you know, weird.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.723
Well, what are you saying?

20:24.974 --> 20:26.600
Are you accusing me of something?

20:26.976 --> 20:28.226
No.

20:28.603 --> 20:32.480
Okay, just stop guilting me.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.149
God...

20:34.233 --> 20:37.861
I thought that I could go through with this
and let the past be the past.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.238
But I can't.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.742
I was with someone when you were away.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.244
Oh, fuck. God, I knew it.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.872
That's why you were
being weird this morning?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.917
But, come on.
You were in New York for three months.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.752
- You weren't with anyone?
- No.

20:53.836 --> 20:57.130
You were in Manhattan
and the Hamptons with Vince.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.008
You're gonna tell me girls weren't
throwing themselves all over you.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.801
I thought we had an agreement.

21:01.886 --> 21:02.886
No, we didn't.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.472
That's what you wanted
but I said I wasn't sure.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.933
Really? I must've missed that
in between all the calls

21:08.017 --> 21:09.601
of you telling me how much you missed me.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.728
I can't believe this. I'm so stupid.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.188
No, you're not.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.398
I'm stupid. You're a great guy.

21:15.483 --> 21:16.816
Who's the other great guy?

21:18.444 --> 21:20.236
Just somebody I met in class.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.283
Were you with him last night?

21:25.368 --> 21:26.826
Or did you really have food poisoning?

21:27.995 --> 21:29.371
- Oh, God.
- Eric, please.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.290
I'm sorry. I don't want it to end like this.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.631
I didn't come here to accuse you of anything.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.466
I came over here to confess.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.052
I would have rather of been with you,
but last night I got drunk

21:44.136 --> 21:46.221
and fucked a Perfect 10 model.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.889
And...

21:48.140 --> 21:49.891
I fucked her again this morning.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.810
See you later.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.650
- All right, so you confessed?
- Yeah.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.902
That's not confessing,
that's rubbing it in her face!

22:00.987 --> 22:02.070
Good for you!

22:02.613 --> 22:03.905
You should have held out,

22:03.990 --> 22:06.324
made her stew in her own guilt
until it broke her.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.036
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.163
I really am. It's just that...

22:12.498 --> 22:15.125
Last night, she was the hottest girl
I've ever been with.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.460
I didn't get to enjoy it, because I felt guilty.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.088
What about this morning?

22:20.172 --> 22:21.756
Did you enjoy yourself this morning?

22:24.885 --> 22:26.845
Well, I told Kristen I did.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.763
- I fucking knew it, baby!
- Pay up.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.932
Pay up, bro. Cash only.

22:31.642 --> 22:32.809
But, I didn't.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.519
What did I tell you?

22:34.603 --> 22:37.647
Do I know my boy or do I know my boy?
"Hundy spot. "

22:39.025 --> 22:40.775
I'm wearing sweats, bro.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.193
My wallet is in the car.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.154
Forget it.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.658
Why don't you call Leanna tonight?
Take her out. You're a free man now.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.160
No, man, forget that girl.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.037
Only reason she was with me
was 'cause I'm your manager.

22:52.121 --> 22:55.331
So? You know how much pussy
I got in this town I didn't deserve?

22:55.458 --> 22:56.583
All of it.

22:56.751 --> 22:58.418
Look, E...

22:58.794 --> 23:02.088
Sometimes your position in life allows you
to get things you never could've had.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.840
That doesn't mean it's not right.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.717
And it doesn't mean it's gonna last.

23:05.801 --> 23:09.387
So now that this whole Kristen thing
is finally finished,

23:09.472 --> 23:11.473
it's about time you started
to enjoy yourself a little.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.850
Or at least fake it, so we can.

23:14.268 --> 23:17.604
You know, we could all be
working for the phone company.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.481
All of us.

23:20.191 --> 23:21.649
What the fuck does that mean?

23:21.942 --> 23:24.527
Think about it, E. Think about it.

23:24.653 --> 23:29.074
Hey, guys, why don't we go to Vegas tonight
and have a wild, decadent time.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.284
Forget that you got dumped.
Forget that I don't have a job.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.703
Forget that he's got Shawn Bradley's legs.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.121
I'm trying to enjoy myself.

23:35.206 --> 23:36.831
- You wanna go?
- I want to go.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.291
Just gotta make a quick cash stop.

23:39.794 --> 23:40.960
- Vegas, baby.
- Let's do it!

23:42.588 --> 23:44.130
So, what's wrong?

23:44.215 --> 23:47.884
- She didn't like it?
- Actually, I decided I didn't like her.

23:51.138 --> 23:54.265
So, are you an actor, too? Like Vince?

23:54.850 --> 23:56.226
- No.
- No.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.521
Actually...

24:00.231 --> 24:01.439
Yeah, I'm Vince's manager.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.039
- Phone number!
- Yeah!

24:20.084 --> 24:22.627
- Nice move!
- Get out, I'm driving.

24:25.548 --> 24:26.798
You're the man.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.509
Vegas, baby!

24:29.927 --> 24:30.969
Vegas.
