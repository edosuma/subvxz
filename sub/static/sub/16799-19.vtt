WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:05.696
Previously on Elementary...
I heard the refrigerator door
open, and then all of a sudden,

00:05.730 --> 00:07.698
three gunshots,
and I saw

00:07.740 --> 00:11.301
Jameel on the kitchen floor,
blood everthere.

00:11.340 --> 00:14.070
I know you killed Jameel Clark.
WATSON: He's worked for months

00:14.110 --> 00:16.078
to embed himself in SBK.
An endeavor I cared more about

00:16.110 --> 00:17.600
before I knew he was
a cold-blooded killer.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.174
SBK is a ruthless drug gang.

00:21.420 --> 00:24.082
You want to know who killed
Jameel? SBK killed Jameel.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.088
You're looking for someone
who killed one person.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.418
SBK kills dozens
of people a year.

00:28.460 --> 00:29.620
I'm-a take SBK down,

00:29.660 --> 00:31.787
and anybody who get in my way...
(grunts)

00:31.830 --> 00:33.354
...gonna get hurt.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.096
WOMAN: Sherlock,
I thought you were

00:41.140 --> 00:42.835
coming right back to...

00:42.870 --> 00:44.508
Oh, my God.

00:44.540 --> 00:47.100
Look at you.

00:47.140 --> 00:50.143
I didn't do any of that, did I?

00:50.180 --> 00:51.772
No, no, no.

00:51.810 --> 00:54.415
You didn't leave a scratch.

00:54.450 --> 00:57.442
Well, the night
is still young.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.481
I'll be right there.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.563
WATSON :
Hey.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.498
If I went downstairs
to get a coffee, would I be...

01:18.540 --> 01:20.132
No, my guest
left hours ago.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.670
Oh. Good.

01:21.710 --> 01:23.678
Do I detect just
a hint of judgment?

01:23.710 --> 01:24.802
No, no judgment.

01:24.850 --> 01:27.114
A little concern, maybe.

01:27.150 --> 01:29.243
Well, despite what you may
have heard, no one was injured.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.383
I am fighting off something
of a head cold, though.

01:31.420 --> 01:34.116
That's not what I meant.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.855
There have been a lot

01:35.890 --> 01:38.779
of guests this week,
and I can't help but think

01:38.830 --> 01:41.253
that there might be
more effective ways

01:41.300 --> 01:44.121
to work through everything
that went down with Shinwell.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.762
Since everything
went down with Shinwell,

01:45.800 --> 01:47.267
you've cleaned
your office twice,

01:47.300 --> 01:48.597
you've taken
three remedial cases,

01:48.640 --> 01:50.301
and then you cleaned
your office again.

01:50.340 --> 01:53.730
So is that the picture of mental
health I should aspire to?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.407
Well, the captain
hasn't had anything

01:55.440 --> 01:56.907
you've deemed interesting
this week,

01:56.950 --> 01:58.577
so I know myself.

01:58.610 --> 01:59.645
I like to keep busy.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.409
So working is working for me.

02:01.450 --> 02:02.883
We misjudged a murderer;

02:02.920 --> 02:04.615
we let him into
our closest confidence.

02:04.650 --> 02:06.811
And then I betrayed our
colleagues by destroying

02:06.860 --> 02:08.816
evidence that would_ have
returned hIm to prison.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.885
And he repaid our many
kindnesses by ambushing

02:10.930 --> 02:12.329
and severely beating me.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.225
You've made peace
with all of that?

02:14.260 --> 02:16.797
No, I've just come to accept
that we don't have any options.

02:16.830 --> 02:18.821
There's no way to prove
that Shinwell is a killer,

02:18.870 --> 02:21.862
so unless you want to go to SBK
and out him as an informant...

02:21.900 --> 02:24.209
No, I'd still rather
he wipe out a street gang

02:24.240 --> 02:25.867
than the other way around.

02:25.910 --> 02:27.832
Okay, so we move on.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.871
I'm gonna go down
to the precinct,

02:29.910 --> 02:31.400
see ifI can lend a hand with
whatever they're working on.

02:31.450 --> 02:32.815
You want to come?
No.

02:32.850 --> 02:35.341
Perfunctory investigation
will do me no good, Watson.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.938
To clean out the cobwebs,

02:36.990 --> 02:39.208
I need something
truly stimulating.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.557
(grunting)

02:52.900 --> 02:56.768
First up,
Mr. Gary Kalajian.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.599
Marco, did you pull
a shift this weekend?

03:02.650 --> 03:06.313
We were closed. Why?

03:07.880 --> 03:11.247
When I closed on Friday,
this cremator was clean.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.287
Oh, my God.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.529
Call the police.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.805
Now.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.637
What should I tell them?

03:32.680 --> 03:35.979
Tell them somebody
got burned alive here.

03:39.850 --> 03:42.387
*

04:04.740 --> 04:06.605
It's a good thing femurs
are as thick as they are.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.437
The biggest bones didn't
burn down completely.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.947
It's the only way
I could tell that there were

04:09.980 --> 04:13.746
_ two victims stuffed
Into the crematory furnace.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.919
Looks like both were male.
Good eye.

04:15.950 --> 04:17.542
You can tell by the width
of the intertrochanteric crest.

04:17.590 --> 04:20.889
Whoever they were,
one of them left a handprint

04:20.920 --> 04:22.626
just inside
the incinerator door.

04:22.660 --> 04:23.957
HAWES:
It's over eight inches long.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.457
He was probably tall.

04:25.490 --> 04:27.958
And alive when he went
into the incinerator.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.592
Here. Have a nightmare.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.427
BELL: The blood was smeared
and then cooked, so...

04:31.470 --> 04:33.392
No fingerprints.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.431
I'm guessing you would have
invited us to the scene

04:35.470 --> 04:36.368
if there was
something to see.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.504
_ Rear exit_door was
pried open With a crowbar.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.508
The break-in happened
sometime over the weekend.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.440
The crematorium workers
all have aIIbIS,

04:43.480 --> 04:45.368
and we couldn't find anybody
who works in the area

04:45.410 --> 04:46.570
who saw anything suspicious.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.349
WATSON:
No security cameras?

04:48.380 --> 04:50.416
BELL: The owner says
they create privacy issues.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.486
We got nothing.

04:52.520 --> 04:53.817
HAWES:
Only if you don't count

04:53.860 --> 04:56.749
two piles of dust,
teeth and bone fragments.

04:56.790 --> 04:57.882
And whatever these are.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.818
HAWES: Those were found
at the back of the incinerator,

04:59.860 --> 05:01.828
near where the taller
John Doe's feet were.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.919
I'm pretty sure they were
an orthopedic brace

05:03.970 --> 05:05.062
that melted down.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.568
Uh, something
like this.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.531
We should check with
Missmg Persons,

05:10.570 --> 05:13.368
see if anyone's been
reported who wears one.

05:13.410 --> 05:16.402
We should also start calling
dentists in Dongan Hills.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.576
If I'm right about this,

05:17.610 --> 05:19.942
we need to locate
the dental records

05:19.980 --> 05:21.743
of one Frederick Kirby,

05:21.780 --> 05:25.079
and see if we get a match
for that gold tooth.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.849
Are you saying
you know one of these guys?

05:26.890 --> 05:28.482
After a fashion.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.078
Mr. Kirby was likely

05:30.130 --> 05:32.928
the worst private investigator
in New York City.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.434
(door bells jingle)

05:39.470 --> 05:40.892
BELL:
Well, it's official.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.465
Captain just got the call.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.705
The gold incisor
and a couple of the molars

05:45.740 --> 05:47.105
and the smaller pile of ash

05:47.140 --> 05:48.539
match Fred Kirby's
dental records.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.741
Which means it took you
all of ten minutes

05:50.780 --> 05:53.112
to identify a John Doe
who'd been burnt to powder.

05:53.150 --> 05:55.710
That's got to be a record.
No, it was nothing.

05:55.750 --> 05:56.944
How many men do you know
proudly wear

05:56.990 --> 05:58.719
a high school class ring?

05:58.750 --> 06:00.615
Uh, you never told us
how you knew him.

06:00.660 --> 06:03.823
He came by the brownstone once,
accused me of poaching.

06:03.860 --> 06:06.590
You stole one of his clients?

06:06.630 --> 06:08.791
No, I was cornered by
a dissatisfied customer of his.

06:08.830 --> 06:10.718
I took one look
at Mr. Kirby's files,

06:10.770 --> 06:12.169
solved the case
on the spot.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.589
I've never seen such
shoddy detective work.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.834
(phone chimes)

06:15.870 --> 06:17.531
This place is
a temple of incompetence.

06:17.570 --> 06:19.037
According to
the captain,

06:19.070 --> 06:21.800
this guy's one employee
is missing, too.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.172
The name's Lamont Wallace,
but he goes by "Pinlq."

06:24.210 --> 06:26.542
Started driving for Fred
a couple years ago

06:26.580 --> 06:28.673
when Fred's eyes
started to go.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.985
A legally blind private eye.
No comment.

06:32.020 --> 06:33.556
No one's been
able to get

06:33.590 --> 06:35.808
either of them on the phone
for two days.

06:35.860 --> 06:37.521
Well, Lamont's a big guy.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.028
Could have been his handprint
in the incinerator.

06:40.060 --> 06:41.857
Yeah, maybe he and Fred
took on a dangerous case

06:41.900 --> 06:42.889
that got them both killed.

06:44.730 --> 06:46.732
You got something?

06:46.770 --> 06:50.558
There_'s_almost a dozen
restraining orders here.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.002
These are all filed
within days of each other.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.518
Yeah, none of the complainants
have the same last name,

07:00.550 --> 07:02.586
but it's got to be a
coordinated effort, right?

07:02.620 --> 07:04.542
BELL:
You'd think.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.514
Question is: what's the
link between these people?

07:07.560 --> 07:09.152
Tragedy.

07:10.990 --> 07:13.550
HOLMES: I assume you're familiar
with the shooting spree

07:13.600 --> 07:16.125
that occurred at
the Bennett Courthouse in 1987?

07:16.160 --> 07:18.094
Guy shoots a bunch
of brand-new citizens

07:18.130 --> 07:19.961
after a swearing-in ceremony.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.968
His wife was their
CIVICS teacher, rIght?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.639
Four people dead,
six more wounded,

07:24.670 --> 07:26.831
and the shooter ended up
taking his own life.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.542
It was a tragedy, not a mystery.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.946
So what's it got to do
with a detective and his buddy

07:31.980 --> 07:33.971
getting burnt alive
30 years later?

07:34.020 --> 07:35.510
In Fred Kirby's office,

07:35.550 --> 07:37.518
we found multiple
restraining orders against him.

07:37.550 --> 07:40.212
All of them were filed by
family members of the victims

07:40.260 --> 07:41.613
of the courthouse shooting.

07:41.660 --> 07:43.525
It appears that Mr. Kirby
reached out

07:43.560 --> 07:46.529
to anyone tangentially
associated with the shooting.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.699
To what end, we don't know.

07:48.730 --> 07:50.527
You talk to any
of these people yet?

07:50.570 --> 07:53.664
No. Watson's on her way
to speak to Virginia Spivey.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.533
She was married to the hero
bailiff who charged the gunman.

07:56.570 --> 07:59.038
Took a bullet that
day, but survived.

07:59.070 --> 08:01.573
Unfortunately, he died
of lymphoma last year.

08:01.610 --> 08:04.738
Virginia Spivey was
the first one to file.

08:04.780 --> 08:07.146
You think papering him
with Orders of Protection

08:07.180 --> 08:08.738
was her idea?
That's the hope.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.816
If she was in touch
with all of these people,

08:10.850 --> 08:13.614
perhaps she'll be able to tell
us if any of them would have

08:13.660 --> 08:16.754
been likely to have cremated
Fred Kirby and his helper.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.155
In the meantime, Marcus and I

08:18.190 --> 08:19.794
are going to visit
the Bennett Courthouse.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.094
Why? The shooting happened
decades ago.

08:22.130 --> 08:23.722
What do you think
you're gonna find?

08:23.770 --> 08:26.591
This was in
Fred's office.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.099
Court employee badge.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.539
It's a sloppy forgery.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.104
I'm going to
chalk up the alias

08:34.140 --> 08:36.108
to his overheated sense
of whimsy.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.607
But I would
like to know

08:37.650 --> 08:38.844
why he deemed it necessary

08:38.880 --> 08:41.144
to go undercover
at the courthouse.

08:43.150 --> 08:44.947
Mr. Holmes.

08:44.990 --> 08:47.185
Louis Garmendia.

08:47.220 --> 08:51.725
I wish it wasn't such a sad
occasron that we got together.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.251
But it is an honor
to finally meet you.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.962
You know me?
Of_ course. I'm
Lours Garmendia.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.128
President of the New York
Order of Private Investigators.

09:00.170 --> 09:03.298
Oh, the silver star
people-- NYOOPI.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.864
Yeah, that's us.

09:04.910 --> 09:07.777
So, are you responsible
for their, uh,

09:07.810 --> 09:09.744
rise in prominence?

09:09.780 --> 09:11.668
Well, I don't know if I can
really take credit for that.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.018
I just took over.

09:13.050 --> 09:15.109
But that is how I knew Fred.

09:15.150 --> 09:16.788
And, obviously,
we're all broken up

09:16.820 --> 09:18.344
over what happened to him.

09:18.390 --> 09:19.857
Mm.
Amway,

09:19.890 --> 09:21.949
as president,
I just wanted to come down

09:21.990 --> 09:24.754
and let you know you've got
the association's full support.

09:24.790 --> 09:27.224
Anything you
or the department needs,

09:27.260 --> 09:28.750
you say the word.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.199
All right, well, I'll be sure
to pass that along.

09:30.230 --> 09:33.893
Mai_n reason I came down
IS to say thank you.

09:33.940 --> 09:37.205
Means a lot to have one of our
own working this thing for Fred.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.128
Sorry, one of your own?

09:39.170 --> 09:40.603
NYOOPI members.

09:40.640 --> 09:41.902
You and your partner.

09:41.940 --> 09:44.738
Feels right
keeping it in the family.

09:44.780 --> 09:48.876
Remind me, how long have
we been in the family?

09:48.920 --> 09:51.218
WATSON:
So, Houston, you were a pitcher?

09:51.250 --> 09:52.649
JOSH:
He still is.

09:52.690 --> 09:55.113
Lowest ERA in
Division II.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.684
You know
St. Cassius College?

09:56.730 --> 09:58.288
You should come see
us play sometime.

09:58.330 --> 10:01.094
Did you not hear her tell my mom
she's with the police?

10:01.130 --> 10:03.394
JOSH: What, police
don't like baseball?

10:03.430 --> 10:06.092
All right, guys,
that's the rest. (chuckles)

10:06.130 --> 10:07.688
Everything's okay, right?

10:07.740 --> 10:10.800
Everything's fine.
I'm just here to talk.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.000
You two drive safe.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.803
Thanks, Mrs. Spivey.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.274
Very nice meeting you.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.111
Sorry about that.
(chuckles)

10:20.150 --> 10:22.641
But you said you wanted to talk
about the courthouse shooting,

10:22.690 --> 10:24.419
and it seemed like
I should get the boys

10:24.450 --> 10:26.850
on their way first.
Of course.

10:26.890 --> 10:28.687
I was just wondering about
some of the contact

10:28.720 --> 10:31.120
you might have had recently with
the other victims' families.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.991
I've had a lot, actually.

10:33.030 --> 10:34.292
More than usual.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.821
The 30th anniversary
was last month,

10:36.870 --> 10:39.327
and, uh, well, you can probably
tell I like remembrances.

10:39.370 --> 10:40.837
We raised a
little money

10:40.870 --> 10:43.703
and did a memorial exhibit
at the courthouse.

10:43.740 --> 10:44.968
Something to make sure

10:45.010 --> 10:46.739
the people who died
aren't forgotten.

10:47.740 --> 10:48.809
Well, here.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.381
Looks like you did
some great work.

10:57.420 --> 10:59.786
I wanted to do it years ago,
but Gordon, my husband,

10:59.820 --> 11:01.048
he wouldn't have it.

11:01.090 --> 11:03.354
He passed away
last year,

11:03.390 --> 11:06.382
so now he can't object
to being remembered as a hero.

11:06.430 --> 11:07.795
Which he was.

11:07.830 --> 11:09.422
If he hadn't charged
the shooter,

11:09.460 --> 11:11.121
well, let's just say

11:11.170 --> 11:13.468
that would've been_
a much bigger memorial.

11:13.500 --> 11:17.106
Am I correct that you
and some of the other families

11:17.140 --> 11:20.303
filed restraining orders
against a man named Fred Kirby?

11:20.340 --> 11:22.877
Yeah.
He was bothering all of us.

11:22.910 --> 11:24.741
Said he was trying
to put together

11:26.880 --> 11:28.313
His story kept changing.

11:28.350 --> 11:31.478
It was weird, so I got a lawyer
to shut him down.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.852
And I told the others
to do the same.

11:33.890 --> 11:35.084
Is that why you're here?

11:35.120 --> 11:37.088
Has he done
something illegal?

11:37.130 --> 11:39.223
He died this past weekend.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.820
Uh, more specifically,
he was murdered.

11:41.860 --> 11:42.895
Oh, my God.

11:42.930 --> 11:44.795
You think one of us...?

11:44.830 --> 11:46.889
I'm just curious. Is it possible
that any of the people

11:46.940 --> 11:48.498
he was harassing might've been
angry enough to...

11:48.540 --> 11:50.428
Uh, no. No, not a chance.

11:50.470 --> 11:52.267
He wasn't harassing anyone,

11:52.310 --> 11:55.871
he just wanted stuff
that belonged to the victims.

11:55.910 --> 11:57.400
We think he was a collector,

11:57.450 --> 11:58.405
or maybe a dealer.

11:58.450 --> 11:59.940
A dealer?

11:59.980 --> 12:01.868
You ever heard the term
"murderabilia"?

12:01.920 --> 12:03.888
People buy and sell

12:03.920 --> 12:05.911
I guess you'd
call them artifacts

12:05.950 --> 12:09.488
that connect back _
to famous murders or tragedies.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.420
It's pretty sick.

12:11.460 --> 12:14.258
We just thought Fred
was trying to make a buck.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.222
He should've been ashamed
of himself.

12:16.260 --> 12:17.864
But trust me.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.892
None of us
would've killed the guy.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.908
(door closes, lock clicks)

12:22.940 --> 12:24.362
Hey. I'm home.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.002
What do you think?

12:32.050 --> 12:34.348
I think there's a bus bench

12:34.380 --> 12:37.019
with my picture on it
in the library.

12:37.050 --> 12:38.984
I used
Fred Kirby's guy.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.954
It was a rush job,
so it wasn't cheap,

12:40.990 --> 12:42.457
but he threw in
the bench for free.

12:42.490 --> 12:45.425
So are you gonna tell me
what this is about, or...?

12:45.460 --> 12:46.950
NYOOPI.

12:48.130 --> 12:50.894
N-Y-O-O-P-I,

12:50.930 --> 12:54.388
the absurd acronym for an even
more absurd organization--

12:54.440 --> 12:56.829
one which _counts us both
as members in good standing.

12:56.870 --> 12:58.235
Oh, yeah.

12:58.270 --> 12:59.806
The detective thing.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.899
Yeah, "the detective thing."

13:01.940 --> 13:04.079
I don't get it.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.146
Are you angry
because I signed us up?

13:06.180 --> 13:07.977
So you don't deny it.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.011
Yeah, it was years ago.
You'd gone back to London.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.847
When you came back, I added you.

13:11.890 --> 13:13.312
It's free advertising.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.055
They put us on
the "Find a Detective" page

13:15.090 --> 13:16.216
on their Web site.

13:16.260 --> 13:17.352
That is precisely the problem:

13:17.390 --> 13:19.028
I do not care
for the association.

13:19.060 --> 13:19.685
Why?

13:19.730 --> 13:21.857
Because the group is a sham.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.891
They've completely usurped
the New York State

13:23.930 --> 13:25.488
Division of Licensing Services

13:25.530 --> 13:28.533
and destroyed all semblance
of standards in our profession.

13:28.570 --> 13:30.208
What are you talking about?

13:30.240 --> 13:32.458
Once upon a time,
every aspiring P.I.

13:32.510 --> 13:35.070
had to take an exam
administered by the state.

13:35.110 --> 13:37.249
It wasn't terribly difficult,
but it was something.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.046
It was a barrier to entry
to keep the riffraff out.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.149
Now Internet searches
have become

13:42.180 --> 13:44.512
the primary arbiter of
legitimacy in every profession.

13:44.550 --> 13:46.859
So this... this star

13:46.890 --> 13:49.358
is all you need
to be a detective in New York.

13:49.390 --> 13:54.020
For $278 in annual fees,
anyone can advertise using this,

13:54.060 --> 13:56.358
and gain access to NYOOPI's
all-important Web site.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.028
So here, have your pick.

13:59.070 --> 14:02.392
Disgraced FBI agents,
idiots off the street, me.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.466
We are all equal
in the eyes of this group.

14:07.510 --> 14:08.977
You're being a snob.

14:09.010 --> 14:10.978
Someone has to be.

14:11.010 --> 14:12.307
Did you get my
text earlier,

14:12.350 --> 14:13.977
about why Fred Kirby
might have been harassing

14:14.020 --> 14:15.942
Virginia Spivey and the others?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.016
I did.
Well, I spent the
afternoon online,

14:18.050 --> 14:20.314
looking at
murderabilia auctions.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.625
I didn't see anything there on
the Bennett Courthouse shooting.

14:23.660 --> 14:26.322
So I also looked at
Kirby's financials.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.248
It didn't look like he ever sold
that kind of stuff,

14:28.300 --> 14:30.962
so it makes me wonder why he was
so interested in what happened.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.422
It's a good question.

14:32.470 --> 14:34.529
I might be able
to shed some light.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.201
In 1987,

14:38.240 --> 14:40.504
when new citizens were sworn in
at the Bennett Courthouse,

14:40.540 --> 14:42.371
it was customary to give them
pocket-sized copies

14:42.410 --> 14:45.049
of the Constitution.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.174
These were on display
at Ms. Spivey's memorial.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.188
I borrowed them,
along with

14:50.220 --> 14:53.018
this photograph of the victims
taken shortly before

14:53.060 --> 14:54.118
the shooting started.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.618
Now, this is photograph
was taken when the memorial

14:57.660 --> 14:59.218
first opened last month.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.296
Notice the blood color
and patterns

15:01.330 --> 15:03.093
on these Constitutions.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.592
These are different.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.108
Mm. The blood that you're
looking at is fake.

15:10.140 --> 15:13.439
These are reproductions.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.574
They are also laden with
Fred Kirby's fingerprints.

15:16.610 --> 15:18.271
So he swapped these
Constitutions out

15:18.310 --> 15:20.619
for the real ones; he got
his murderabilia after all.

15:20.650 --> 15:23.084
Yes, but perhaps
not to sell.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.985
What do you mean?

15:25.020 --> 15:27.113
I mean, it's possible
Fred Kirby did what he did

15:27.160 --> 15:28.559
because he believed
the US. government

15:28.590 --> 15:31.081
once caused a nuclear reactor
to melt down.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.586
Just as it's possible

15:32.630 --> 15:35.121
that testing his theory
resulted in his murder.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.457
What are you talking about?

15:36.500 --> 15:40.095
I'm talking, Watson,
about Chernobyl.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.506
HOLMES:
On April 26, 1986,

15:52.550 --> 15:55.576
a test of the Chernobyl power
plant's safety system went awry,

15:55.620 --> 15:58.646
causing one of its
nuclear reactors to explode.

15:58.690 --> 16:01.158
I remember. Everyone remembers.

16:01.190 --> 16:03.158
The blast
and the radiation exposure

16:03.190 --> 16:04.350
killed dozens that day.

16:04.390 --> 16:07.029
Eventually, thousands more
died of cancer.

16:07.060 --> 16:10.063
Human error was cited
as the preCIpitating cause.

16:10.100 --> 16:13.160
The official report
did not name any names.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.088
But according to one theory
on the Internet,

16:15.140 --> 16:18.701
the fault lies with four men:
Igor Krasnaia, Roman Hubenko,

16:18.740 --> 16:21.038
Dmitry Perov
and Sergei Minkovski.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.479
Their bodies
were never recovered,

16:22.510 --> 16:25.047
and photographs of the men
do not exist.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.104
Okay.

16:26.150 --> 16:27.174
Conspiracy theorists

16:27.220 --> 16:29.438
have long believed
that these men were saboteurs,

16:29.480 --> 16:32.119
working at the behest
of the American government.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.710
In return for their crimes,
they were granted new lives

16:34.760 --> 16:37.388
in the United States.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.125
Those were the four men
that were killed

16:39.160 --> 16:40.149
in the Bennett Courthouse
shoobng?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.053
That's what people think?

16:41.100 --> 16:42.419
I did not say "people."

16:42.460 --> 16:44.098
I said "conspiracy theorists."

16:44.130 --> 16:45.722
Proud members
of the tinfoil hat brigade.

16:45.770 --> 16:49.160
Now, this was the shooter;
his name is Ronald Jones.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.067
His victims had just taken
the oath of citizenship.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.270
They were Chris Corwin,

16:53.310 --> 16:57.098
Nick Welden, Pete Goswin
and Leo Stavo.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.539
But some people believe
that these were aliases

16:59.580 --> 17:01.571
given to them
by the American government

17:01.620 --> 17:04.282
before a rogue agent
wiped them out.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.810
You don't really
believe that, right?

17:05.850 --> 17:08.182
No. But it doesn't matter
what I believe.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.654
The question is:
did Fred Kirby believe it?

17:10.690 --> 17:12.555
History is full
of imbeciles

17:12.590 --> 17:14.455
whose outlandish theories
have got them killed,

17:14.500 --> 17:17.128
so perhaps he shared his with
one of the victims' loved ones,

17:17.170 --> 17:18.319
and they took it poorly.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.723
Well, talking
to loved ones

17:19.770 --> 17:21.237
is one thing.

17:21.270 --> 17:22.794
Fred Kirby was trying
to get his hands

17:22.840 --> 17:24.831
on the victims'
personal effects.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.406
He stole mini-Constitutions
with their blood on it.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.374
Why?

17:28.410 --> 17:31.174
If these men really were
nuclear saboteurs,

17:31.210 --> 17:33.371
then their DNA
would've been damaged.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.513
Traces of caesium-137

17:35.550 --> 17:38.280
would mark their remains
for hundreds of years.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.754
The question of where
a low-rent private eye would go

17:40.790 --> 17:44.248
to test for such a thing
is another matter entirely.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.281
No, it isn't.

17:46.330 --> 17:49.299
I think I might know
where he would go.

17:51.230 --> 17:54.097
Yeah, I knew Fred. He's in my
bowling league. We're friends.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.165
He's dead, huh?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.768
Fred specialized
in cheating spouses,

17:58.810 --> 18:00.835
the kind who leave stains
in cheap motel rooms.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.233
I imagine, occasionally,

18:02.280 --> 18:04.748
he needed you to run
a DNA sample for him.

18:04.780 --> 18:07.146
WATSON: When I went through
Fred's financials yesterday,

18:07.180 --> 18:09.319
I noticed he wrote quite a few
checks to you over the years.

18:09.350 --> 18:10.612
Just you.

18:10.650 --> 18:12.584
Never to East Rutherford
Laboratories.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.178
You were giving him a discount

18:14.220 --> 18:15.414
and pocketing
the payments yourself.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.325
No, that's not true.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.453
We also went through Fred's
phone records yesterday.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.526
He talked to you
six times last week.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.120
Can we assume it was
about the blood samples

18:29.800 --> 18:32.530
(opening drawers)

18:32.570 --> 18:34.800
Hey, what are you doing?

18:34.840 --> 18:37.172
Mr. Drexel, we didn't
bring the police with us

18:37.210 --> 18:38.802
because we don't care about

18:38.850 --> 18:40.511
your minor league embezzlement.
We don't.

18:40.550 --> 18:43.189
It was a courtesy to you,
but it also works in our favor,

18:43.220 --> 18:45.211
'cause it means we can conduct
an illegal search

18:45.250 --> 18:47.354
for the materials
that Fred gave you.

18:47.390 --> 18:48.550
Yeah, I'll start
over here.

18:48.590 --> 18:50.251
No,dont.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.429
I'll give you
everything I've got, okay?

18:55.300 --> 18:56.528
The samples,

18:56.560 --> 18:58.562
the results, all of it.

19:02.270 --> 19:04.261
He wasn't checking
for radioactivity,

19:04.310 --> 19:06.301
he was running
paternity tests.

19:06.340 --> 19:08.808
Radioactivity? Why the hell
would I be looking for that?

19:08.840 --> 19:10.740
Fred didn't think that the men
who bled on these documents

19:10.780 --> 19:11.747
were at Chernobyl?

19:11.780 --> 19:13.577
No. God, no.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.349
He gave me that blood sample
and the four Constitutions.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.348
He asked me to
look for a match.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.880
Who's C. Gibson?

19:18.920 --> 19:19.944
I don't have any idea.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.582
I just know the guy
was looking for his father.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.429
But the blood on those
things wasn't viable.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.428
All the_ results came back
inconclu5ive.

19:25.460 --> 19:28.293
If you want to harass someone,
you should go find him.

19:28.330 --> 19:29.649
Why's that?

19:29.700 --> 19:31.793
Fred was nervous about
breaking the news to him.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.434
Said the guy had a real temper.

19:33.470 --> 19:35.290
I don't know.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.365
Maybe he's the one
who killed Fred.

19:40.710 --> 19:43.577
WATSON: This would be a lot
easier if Fred's Kirby's system

19:43.610 --> 19:46.249
wasn't put stuff in files
ordonT.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.612
Well, credit the man
for consistency.

19:48.650 --> 19:51.539
He was lazy and inept
in all facets of his business.

19:51.590 --> 19:52.841
Still, C. Gibson's
full name's got to be

19:52.890 --> 19:53.857
in here somewhere here, right?

19:53.890 --> 19:55.517
Yes, finally.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.788
You found it?

19:56.820 --> 19:59.527
Better. I found years
of annual reports

19:59.560 --> 20:02.449
of Fred Kirby's time
on the board of NYOOPI.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.990
Why would you want that?

20:04.030 --> 20:05.998
Because I hope to find evidence
of embezzlement or fraud.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.294
Let's see how many people
pay for that preposterous

20:08.340 --> 20:11.662
silver star when it becomes
a mark of corruption.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.234
NYOOPI helps people
find detectives.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.373
Why do you have
a problem with that?

20:15.410 --> 20:17.344
Because I want people
to be able to find detectives

20:17.380 --> 20:19.348
who've earned the right
to be called detectives.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.449
Well, if it were up to you,
there'd only be

20:20.480 --> 20:21.879
four or five people like that
in the whole world.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.444
Your point?

20:23.490 --> 20:26.709
If NYOOPI offends you so much,
why don't you just quit?

20:26.750 --> 20:28.957
Because then I won't be able
to pull it apart,

20:28.990 --> 20:30.651
piece by piece, from the inside.

20:30.690 --> 20:32.521
Has it ever occurred to you

20:32.560 --> 20:34.528
that all this righteous
indignation has less to do

20:34.560 --> 20:36.528
with a bunch of private eyes
supporting each other,

20:36.560 --> 20:38.369
and more to do with Shinwell?

20:38.400 --> 20:40.368
What happened
upset you.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.992
And despite a string of
meaningless sexual conquests,

20:42.040 --> 20:44.406
you're still upset,
so now you're gonna take it out

20:44.440 --> 20:46.658
on a bunch of
less talented detectives.

20:46.710 --> 20:48.371
My motives are irrelevant.

20:48.410 --> 20:51.049
NYOOPI is the lowest form
of fake credentialism

20:51.080 --> 20:52.638
and it ought not to exist.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.341
And by the time I'm finished,
it won't.

20:54.380 --> 20:55.847
Where are you going?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.440
The "C" in C. Gibson
stood for Carter.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.355
I found his name and address
ten minutes ago.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.017
I just lingered
to look for these.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.496
BELL:
Here's your tea.

21:07.530 --> 21:10.499
Two lumps. Now you got
to tell me what's up.

21:10.530 --> 21:14.534
Thanks. So, our victims, Fred
Kirby and the missing driver,

21:14.570 --> 21:16.629
were working for a man
named Carter Gibson.

21:16.670 --> 21:19.332
Now, I could not find
a link between that name

21:19.370 --> 21:20.974
and the Bennet_t Courthouse
shoobng,

21:21.010 --> 21:23.478
_ but that's because
Gibson's name is made-up. See?

21:23.510 --> 21:25.569
Carter Gibson was

21:25.610 --> 21:28.408
Carter Dunwitty until
he changed his name in 2007.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.509
Rita Dunwitty was
one of the survivors

21:30.550 --> 21:32.313
of the shooting in '87.

21:32.350 --> 21:35.410
More than that, she was married
to the shooter, Ronald Jones.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.485
BELL:
Right.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.781
So, he was Carter's father.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.354
As far as
the world knew, yes,

21:40.400 --> 21:43.028
but Carter was convinced
that Ronald Jones, the shooter,

21:43.060 --> 21:44.596
was not his father.

21:44.630 --> 21:47.337
So, he hired Fred Kirby
to run paternity tests

21:47.370 --> 21:49.338
for the four men
who were killed in '87,

21:49.370 --> 21:50.928
but none of them panned out.

21:50.970 --> 21:54.098
Sounds like
wishful thinking, right?

21:54.140 --> 21:56.574
I mean, this is a guy
who changes his name

21:56.610 --> 21:58.373
to climb out of
his family tree.

21:58.410 --> 22:00.469
Can you blame him?

22:00.520 --> 22:02.112
BELL:
Looks like Carter

22:02.150 --> 22:03.447
has some problems of his own.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.639
Disorderly conduct

22:04.690 --> 22:06.681
and resisting,
misdemeanor assault.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.051
It's a nickel-and-dime sheet,

22:08.090 --> 22:09.614
but he obviously has
a violent streak.

22:09.660 --> 22:12.720
Well, if Carter Gibson
is Ronald Jones's son,

22:12.760 --> 22:15.399
he may just be a chip
off the crazy old block.

22:15.430 --> 22:18.467
I wonder how Carter took
the news when Fred Kirby

22:18.500 --> 22:20.127
couldn't identify the dad
he was hoping for.

22:20.170 --> 22:22.638
Well, you're not the first
person to wonder that.

22:22.670 --> 22:24.729
Sherlock and the captain
took a couple of uniforms

22:24.770 --> 22:26.328
over to his house.
(phone dings)

22:28.440 --> 22:31.079
Actually, they say they need us
over there right away.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.718
(siren whoops)

22:34.750 --> 22:36.741
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

22:46.590 --> 22:48.592
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

22:51.570 --> 22:53.538
Quite a mess.

22:53.570 --> 22:54.832
We knocked. No one answered.

22:54.870 --> 22:56.599
Building manager let us in.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.564
Got a pile of mail,
trash is ripe--

22:59.610 --> 23:02.932
doesn't look like Carter
Gibson's been home in days.

23:02.980 --> 23:06.438
Let me guess, we're thinking
he got into some kind of scrap

23:06.480 --> 23:08.869
with Fred Kirby
and Pinky Wallace right here.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.012
Carter won,

23:10.050 --> 23:11.711
he cremated them,
went on the run.

23:11.750 --> 23:14.548
I just put his photo out
to everyone in the ﬁeld.

23:14.590 --> 23:16.888
HOLMES:
Captain, if you would.

23:19.130 --> 23:22.554
We need to revise our theory
of the crime that occurred

23:22.600 --> 23:23.862
in the next room.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.868
I don't think

23:25.900 --> 23:28.095
Carter Gibson was
the perpetrator, after all.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.698
What am I missing?

23:29.740 --> 23:31.435
Metal rods were mixed in

23:31.470 --> 23:33.165
with the cremains
in the incmerator.

23:33.210 --> 23:34.438
HOLMES: They're identical
to the ones

23:34.480 --> 23:36.175
in this orthopedic brace.

23:36.210 --> 23:37.871
Gibson had a gammy foot.

23:37.910 --> 23:40.003
You can see in that
photograph over there.

23:40.050 --> 23:41.472
Now, one could argue
that he threw

23:41.520 --> 23:42.873
_ one of his _braces
into the incmerator

23:42.920 --> 23:44.842
to trick us, to make us think
that he was dead,

23:44.890 --> 23:46.881
but if he did that,
why wouldn't he throw in

23:46.920 --> 23:48.649
that watch, as well?

23:48.690 --> 23:50.555
_It_'s inscribed with his
original name on the back.

23:50.590 --> 23:52.057
And if he's a man on the run,

23:52.090 --> 23:55.127
why didn't he take
his medication with him?

23:55.160 --> 23:57.924
So, the second vic
was Pinlq Wallace.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.858
We thought it was him
because he was tall.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.539
But this is size 14, and
according to Carter's sheet,

24:02.570 --> 24:04.060
he's six-three.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.499
You think half the
blood out there is his?

24:06.540 --> 24:09.077
Just as I think that's his
handprint in the incinerator.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.144
I think he was the one
who was burned alive.

24:22.060 --> 24:23.982
You guys find something?

24:24.030 --> 24:26.521
Killer left some
partial footprints.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.152
They stop right here,
so you got to figure

24:28.200 --> 24:30.054
this is where he loaded
Fred Kirby

24:30.100 --> 24:31.920
and Carter Gibson's bodies
into a vehicle.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.119
WATSON:
Pinky Wallace,

24:33.170 --> 24:34.592
Fred Kirby's driver, disappeared

24:34.640 --> 24:36.164
around the same time
that Fred did.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.701
So, he might be our guy, right?

24:37.740 --> 24:39.037
Well, you'd think so,
only he isn't.

24:39.070 --> 24:40.537
Finest Message
on him checked out

24:40.580 --> 24:42.070
while you were talking
to the neighbor.

24:42.110 --> 24:43.202
Is he dead, too?

24:43.240 --> 24:44.707
BELL:
No, but he came close.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.207
He's been in the ICU at
St. Bede's for a week.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.571
Checked himself in
with a 104—degree fever.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.042
He was delirious.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.513
Told the nurses his name
was Lando Calri55ian.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.187
That's why we
couldn't find him.

24:55.220 --> 24:57.552
He's got a long recovery from
meningitis ahead of him,

24:57.590 --> 24:58.727
but no prison time.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.228
GREGSON:
How'd it go on your end?

25:01.260 --> 25:03.728
Not great. The night that
Fred Kirby disappeared,

25:03.770 --> 25:05.726
nobody saw anything.

25:05.770 --> 25:09.797
So, a few people heard
a loud bang around midnight.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.262
So, whatever happened here,

25:11.310 --> 25:13.232
maybe they finished it
with a gun.

25:13.270 --> 25:15.830
Anybody find any
slugs or casings?

25:15.880 --> 25:17.609
No, and they won't.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.642
I can't explain your bang,
but this was no shooting.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.113
As you can see

25:22.150 --> 25:25.313
from the blood splatter
on the walls and the ceiling,

25:25.350 --> 25:28.057
it's not the misty spray that
you'd associate with a gunshot.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.682
The droplets are round.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.857
They vary in size.

25:30.890 --> 25:32.221
The killer used a blunt object.

25:32.260 --> 25:34.125
Uh, I think I might even
know which one.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.991
As you can see here,

25:37.030 --> 25:40.966
Carter Gibson has
twice been honored

25:41.000 --> 25:43.798
by the New York
Charcot-Marie-Tooth Coalition.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.660
Recipients of

25:45.710 --> 25:47.837
the Connecting
My Talents Award receive

25:47.880 --> 25:49.836
a commemorative marble orb.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.041
What's a tooth coalition?

25:52.080 --> 25:55.049
Tooth is a surname,
as are Charcot and Marie.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.638
They're the doctors
who first described

25:56.680 --> 25:58.045
the neurological disorder

25:58.090 --> 26:00.911
which is now
more commonly known as CMT.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.179
CMT attacks
the peripheral nervous system,

26:04.230 --> 26:05.959
arms, legs, hands and feet.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.720
It's degenerative and the
symptoms get worse over time.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.593
Now, if Carter Gibson had it,
it would explain

26:11.630 --> 26:12.961
the orthopedic braces

26:13.000 --> 26:15.230
and probably the medications
he was taking.

26:15.270 --> 26:18.137
So, Carter raised money
and awareness for his disease

26:18.170 --> 26:20.809
and the coalition
gave him one of those.

26:20.840 --> 26:21.829
They gave him two.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.131
These photographs tell us

26:23.180 --> 26:27.105
that he received the award
in 2013 and 2015.

26:27.150 --> 26:30.119
The older one is missing.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.084
And you think it's because
the killer took it with him

26:32.120 --> 26:34.111
after he used it to
bash two skulls in?

26:34.160 --> 26:37.084
He grabbed it there
and started swinging?

26:37.120 --> 26:39.384
The blood evidence
would indicate that.

26:39.430 --> 26:42.729
An arcing motion
like this...

26:43.830 --> 26:44.797
(exhales sharply)

26:44.830 --> 26:47.731
...would result in
blood splatter like that.

26:47.770 --> 26:51.228
So, now we know how the mess
was made, but who made it?

26:53.070 --> 26:55.174
GREGSON:
How's it going?

26:55.210 --> 26:58.099
Slowly, but we think
we figured out the real reason

26:58.150 --> 27:00.812
that Carter Gibson was looking
for his biological father.

27:00.850 --> 27:03.683
I just got off the phone
with Leonard Jones,

27:03.720 --> 27:05.142
Ronald Jones's father.

27:05.190 --> 27:06.009
I was calling
to notify him

27:06.050 --> 27:07.415
that we think his
grandson, Carter,

27:07.450 --> 27:08.849
was the victim
of a homicide.

27:08.890 --> 27:10.721
He didn't take
it too hard.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.887
Apparently, they'd been
estranged most of Carter's life.

27:12.930 --> 27:14.898
WATSON: That changed
earlier this year.

27:14.930 --> 27:16.352
Carter's CMT was getting worse.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.369
The disease is inherited
and the symptoms tend to follow

27:19.400 --> 27:20.958
a similar course
Within families.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.059
Now, no one on
his mother's side had it,

27:23.100 --> 27:24.806
so Carter reached out
to his paternal grandfather

27:24.840 --> 27:26.808
to find out
what he could expect.

27:26.840 --> 27:30.003
Thing is, there was no CMT on
that side of the family, either.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.349
How is that possible?
BELL:
30 years ago,

27:32.380 --> 27:34.940
no one really knew why Ronald
Jones shot up the courthouse

27:34.980 --> 27:36.242
where his wife worked,

27:36.280 --> 27:38.714
but Grandpa Leonard
always had a sneaking suspicion.

27:38.750 --> 27:42.049
Ronald had figured out
he wasn't Carter's real dad.

27:42.090 --> 27:44.081
That would explain some things,
like why the four people

27:44.130 --> 27:46.155
he killed and the six
he wounded were all men.

27:46.190 --> 27:48.249
He thought one of them
was sleeping with his wife.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.949
BELL:
It's an old secret,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.719
but maybe someone figured
it was still worth killing over.

27:52.770 --> 27:54.328
WATSON: We were just
about to call the relatives

27:54.370 --> 27:55.735
of the people who filed
restraining orders

27:55.770 --> 27:57.067
against Fred Kirby,

27:57.100 --> 27:58.806
see if any of them
had CMT.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.262
Just tread lightly.

28:00.310 --> 28:03.006
If one of them did this,
we don't want to tip them.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.008
(knocking on door)

28:06.050 --> 28:07.472
Mr. Garmendia.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.444
Sorry to stop by
unannounced like this,

28:09.480 --> 28:11.345
but your address
is in our files.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.187
If you're looking for an update
on the investigation

28:13.220 --> 28:15.188
of Fred Kirby's murder,
I'm afraid I can't help you.

28:15.220 --> 28:16.380
There have been
some developments,

28:16.420 --> 28:18.081
but they need
to remain confidential.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.381
I don't want an update.

28:19.430 --> 28:23.127
I'm here to talk to you,
detective to detective.

28:27.430 --> 28:32.003
I know you broke into
NYOOPI's computer today.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.372
Someone used
Fred Kirby's old log-in

28:34.410 --> 28:37.470
from an LP. address
inside the NYPD,

28:37.510 --> 28:38.875
and then they downloaded

28:38.910 --> 28:42.277
a bunch of our
tax records.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.209
I could tell you didn't
like us when we met.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.957
Got the feeling
we embarrass you.

28:47.990 --> 28:50.515
You want to tell me
what you're up to?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.255
It's quite simple, really.

28:52.290 --> 28:54.190
I'm going to dismantle
your organization.

28:54.230 --> 28:56.357
NYOOPI is a blight

28:56.400 --> 28:57.799
on the profession which I love.

28:57.830 --> 28:59.195
It enables con men and imbeciles

28:59.230 --> 29:01.130
to pass themselves off
as detectives.

29:01.170 --> 29:02.762
Your group deserves
to be exposed

29:02.800 --> 29:04.529
as the rubber stamp that it is.

29:04.570 --> 29:07.835
Would it surprise you to know

29:07.880 --> 29:10.132
that I agree with you
about NYOOPI?

29:10.180 --> 29:12.148
Hmm?

29:12.180 --> 29:16.344
I was an investigator
for the ATF for over 15 years

29:16.380 --> 29:17.938
before I went private.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.412
I get steamed when I see

29:19.450 --> 29:21.509
the kind of folks
that are advertising

29:21.560 --> 29:24.188
with our silver star.

29:24.230 --> 29:27.381
That's why I got involved,
only I don't want to destroy it.

29:27.430 --> 29:29.227
I want to turn it around.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.399
We're offering
training seminars now.

29:31.430 --> 29:33.796
We just launched a message board

29:33.840 --> 29:36.138
where people can
crowdsource their cases.

29:37.870 --> 29:39.337
I want NYOOPI
to help its members

29:39.370 --> 29:41.406
be better at what they do.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.169
Your members want to be better?

29:43.210 --> 29:44.507
A lot of them mean well.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.903
That's not what I asked.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.247
How many of them
are attending your classes?

29:47.280 --> 29:48.542
How many are on
the message board?

29:48.580 --> 29:50.980
All I'm asking for
is a little more time.

29:51.020 --> 29:52.339
NYOOPI's had decades.

29:52.390 --> 29:53.982
Not with me they haven't.

29:54.020 --> 29:57.387
Look, Mr. Holmes,
this-this thing we do,

29:57.420 --> 29:59.251
this job, it's important.

29:59.290 --> 30:02.191
Now, you say you don't like
a lot of our membership.

30:02.230 --> 30:05.199
I get that, but at least
they're in one place now.

30:05.230 --> 30:07.369
NYOOPI goes away, and
they scatter in the wind.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.459
And I won't know if I
could've made them better.

30:09.500 --> 30:13.869
I won't know if I could've
kept a few from getting killed.

30:13.910 --> 30:16.401
Now, it's too late
for Fred Kirby,

30:16.440 --> 30:19.079
but it's not too late
for the rest.

30:19.110 --> 30:23.342
All I can promise you is that
your organization will be spared

30:23.380 --> 30:27.248
my full energies until I have
solved Fred Kirby's murder.

30:27.290 --> 30:29.110
(sighs) Well, I know
how good you are,

30:29.160 --> 30:32.027
so I guess that doesn't
give me much time.

30:32.060 --> 30:34.893
Thanks for
hearing me out.

30:47.640 --> 30:48.971
(thud in distance)

30:49.010 --> 30:51.399
Sherlock?

30:51.450 --> 30:53.270
HOLMES:
In your bedroom.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.880
Hello.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.888
Okay, whatever this is,

31:03.930 --> 31:05.989
does it really need
to be happening in my bedroom?

31:06.030 --> 31:08.999
This is helping me determine
how much force was used

31:09.030 --> 31:11.590
to beat Carter Gibson
and Fred Kirby to death.

31:11.630 --> 31:13.427
I didn't think you'd mind.

31:13.470 --> 31:15.631
Okay, so, you've already
made one miscalculation.

31:15.670 --> 31:18.036
So, how is the rest
of your math going?

31:18.070 --> 31:20.538
Take this.

31:20.570 --> 31:23.130
Yeah.

31:23.180 --> 31:26.547
That spatter pattern
I've painted in black there,

31:26.580 --> 31:30.414
how far is it from Mr. Coconut?

31:33.490 --> 31:36.914
17 feet, seven inches.

31:36.960 --> 31:40.521
That is precisely the distance
that blood and viscera traveled

31:40.560 --> 31:42.653
from the bookcase
to the far wall

31:42.700 --> 31:45.624
at the murder scene
in Carter Gibson's apartment.

31:45.670 --> 31:48.537
Okay, so why did you think
to check that?

31:48.570 --> 31:50.458
Because it is one of the most
distant blood spatters

31:50.500 --> 31:52.229
I've ever encountered.

31:52.270 --> 31:54.409
So distant, in fact,
that efforts to recreate it

31:54.440 --> 31:57.375
with my own arms
have fallen decidedly short.

31:57.410 --> 31:59.503
Maybe you need a stronger arm.

31:59.550 --> 32:01.609
Between an adolescence
spent at the cricket ground

32:01.650 --> 32:03.515
and two decades training
in the combat arts,

32:03.550 --> 32:05.643
my arm strength
is a little above average.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.518
Now, this tropical drupe
is filled with

32:09.560 --> 32:11.482
a synthetic blood
of my own design.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.998
And I'm gonna murder it...
(clears throat)

32:14.030 --> 32:15.725
with a candlepin bowling ball,

32:15.760 --> 32:17.352
which is almost
identical in Size

32:17.400 --> 32:19.664
and weight to the marble award
that was used.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.674
(grunting)

32:41.160 --> 32:42.513
Not even close.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.586
My best effort,
when my arms were still fresh,

32:45.630 --> 32:49.396
created a blood spatter
which reached 14.3 feet.

32:49.430 --> 32:51.660
Okay, so...

32:51.700 --> 32:55.238
_ our killer is a contestant
in the world's strongest man?

32:55.270 --> 32:56.760
Not quite. (sniffles)

32:56.800 --> 33:00.167
This experiment has shown
that creating that pattern

33:00.210 --> 33:01.529
requires power

33:01.580 --> 33:03.571
and form.

33:03.610 --> 33:05.771
The force and motion required
to create the spatter pattern

33:05.810 --> 33:08.415
at Carter Gibson's apartment
are commensurate with

33:08.450 --> 33:10.611
throwing a 98 mile-an-hour
fastball.

33:10.650 --> 33:13.210
That's major league heat.

33:13.250 --> 33:15.616
Yeah, which is precisely
why our killer

33:15.660 --> 33:18.720
is on the verge of making
major league millions.

33:18.760 --> 33:21.194
You told me about him
the other day.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.195
HOUSTON: You thinkI look
like this Carter guy?

33:26.230 --> 33:28.334
WATSON:
A little.

33:28.370 --> 33:30.531
You both have
your father's ears.

33:30.570 --> 33:33.368
Your dad had an affair
with Rita Dunwitty.

33:33.410 --> 33:34.775
Carter's mom.

33:34.810 --> 33:36.368
He was your
half-brother.

33:36.410 --> 33:38.139
Now, you can deny it
if you want,

33:38.180 --> 33:40.740
but we're gonna order
a DNA test to confirm.

33:43.380 --> 33:45.814
I don't believe anything
you're saying.

33:45.850 --> 33:48.387
But, if it's true, so what?

33:48.420 --> 33:50.251
It's why you
killed him.

33:50.290 --> 33:51.382
Along with the
detective he hired

33:51.430 --> 33:53.125
to find his
real father.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.593
WATSON: Carter grew up
thinking that his father

33:54.630 --> 33:56.518
was a mass shooter.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.699
It followed him around
like a dark cloud.

33:58.730 --> 34:00.459
We think that Fred Kirby
uncovered evidence

34:00.500 --> 34:01.728
of the affair.

34:01.770 --> 34:03.397
Now, if we're right,

34:03.440 --> 34:05.169
and Carter could prove
that his real father

34:05.210 --> 34:07.428
was actually the hero
who stopped the shooting,

34:07.470 --> 34:08.505
he probably couldn't wait
to tell the world.

34:08.540 --> 34:11.145
That was gonna be a real problem
for you, wasn't it?

34:11.180 --> 34:13.842
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.848
We're talking about CMT.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.313
What?

34:17.350 --> 34:19.215
Charcot_-Marie-Tooth
disease.

34:19.250 --> 34:21.286
It's a genetic
neuromuscular disorder.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.856
Carter had it.

34:22.890 --> 34:24.551
And given that it's
passed down paternally,

34:24.590 --> 34:26.353
we're guessing that you do, too.

34:26.390 --> 34:28.620
You knew that if anyone
discovered you had it,

34:28.660 --> 34:30.855
your plans of making millions
as a major league pitcher

34:30.900 --> 34:32.322
would be wiped out.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.793
WATSON: Uh, we can't
imagine a team offering

34:34.840 --> 34:37.195
a big contract to someone
who could wake up one morning

34:37.240 --> 34:40.232
and suddenly lose all feeling
in his throwing arm.

34:40.270 --> 34:42.807
If a well-known CMT
advocate like Carter

34:42.840 --> 34:44.774
shared the news about
finding his real family,

34:44.810 --> 34:47.745
say if he put it out
on social media,

34:47.780 --> 34:49.816
it would've been a matter
of time before someone

34:49.850 --> 34:50.771
put two and two together.

34:50.820 --> 34:52.811
Now, you needed
the whole thing to go away

34:52.850 --> 34:54.715
so you could still cash in.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.818
You guys are crazy.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.816
Forget CMT, look at my ERA.

34:57.860 --> 35:00.249
I'm pitching great; I-I don't
have a muscle disorder.

35:00.290 --> 35:01.757
All right, then,
let's talk about something

35:01.800 --> 35:03.358
you definitely don't have:

35:03.400 --> 35:05.391
an alibi for the night
of the murders.

35:05.430 --> 35:07.660
That's because you were
at Carter's apartment.

35:07.700 --> 35:10.464
He and Fred were telling you
things you didn't want to hear,

35:10.500 --> 35:13.139
so you took Carter's award
down from the shelf,

35:13.170 --> 35:14.899
and you killed them with it.

35:14.940 --> 35:17.272
Only a matter of time
until we find it.

35:17.310 --> 35:20.802
Got to think it'll have your
fingerprints on it when we do.

35:23.820 --> 35:24.809
I need you two.

35:24.850 --> 35:26.545
Now.

35:34.530 --> 35:35.758
What's going on?

35:35.800 --> 35:37.495
He was about to
give it up.

35:37.530 --> 35:39.919
Well, that would've been
a real problem for the DA.

35:39.970 --> 35:41.437
How so?

35:41.470 --> 35:43.461
That's Paul Fontino.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.707
He's Houston's pitching coach.

35:45.740 --> 35:47.731
He just confessed
to both murders.

36:00.290 --> 36:02.451
Sorry about the wait,
Mr. Fontino.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.788
We just had to confirm
there really were bloodstains

36:04.830 --> 36:06.479
in the trunk of your car.

36:06.530 --> 36:09.727
Don't know why you'd think
I'd lie about such a thing.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.263
Maybe because
we can't quite figure out

36:12.300 --> 36:14.234
why you would do such a thing.

36:14.270 --> 36:16.898
You've had two parking
tickets in the last 20 years.

36:16.940 --> 36:18.339
But this past weekend,

36:18.370 --> 36:19.632
you just snap?
(snaps fingers)

36:19.670 --> 36:21.479
Murder two people?

36:21.510 --> 36:25.742
I've been working with
Houston Spivey for six years.

36:25.780 --> 36:29.773
Found him when he was a skinny
little high school sophomore.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.811
He's a good kid.

36:31.850 --> 36:33.647
He's got a hell
of a future.

36:33.690 --> 36:35.749
I didn't want to see it wasted.

36:35.790 --> 36:37.712
What does that mean?
Last week,

36:37.760 --> 36:41.389
he tells me this Carter guy
and his crazy P.I.,

36:41.430 --> 36:43.250
they're after him
for a blood test.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.598
Well, he told us he'd
never seen Carter Gibson

36:45.630 --> 36:46.995
before in his life.

36:47.030 --> 36:49.396
You ever been
21 years old before?

36:49.440 --> 36:50.668
Kid's scared.

36:51.870 --> 36:53.804
I mean, if you think
Houston asked me to do this,

36:53.840 --> 36:55.239
you got the wrong idea.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.929
He wanted to pay them.

36:56.980 --> 36:59.608
He asked me for the money.
What money?

36:59.650 --> 37:02.619
They were extorting him; they
wanted $50,000 to keep quiet.

37:02.650 --> 37:04.686
And they thought Houston,
a college student,

37:04.720 --> 37:06.608
would have 50 grand
lying around?

37:06.650 --> 37:08.686
I'm sure they figured that
a future first rounder

37:08.720 --> 37:10.915
would be able to
get his hands on some money

37:10.960 --> 37:12.382
if he really wanted it.

37:12.430 --> 37:13.954
He probably could've.

37:13.990 --> 37:15.890
But I didn't think
it was right.

37:15.930 --> 37:17.898
I told Houston I'd handle it.

37:17.930 --> 37:20.319
So you set up a meeting?

37:20.370 --> 37:21.769
At Carter's apartment.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.268
I thought I'd rant
and rave a little

37:24.310 --> 37:26.835
and get them to back off.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.406
But they weren't budging.

37:28.440 --> 37:29.600
I saw red,

37:29.640 --> 37:31.540
grabbed this...

37:31.580 --> 37:36.517
marble statue thing
off from the shelf...

37:36.550 --> 37:38.313
that was that.

37:40.090 --> 37:41.557
HOLMES:
Well, he's lying obviously.

37:41.590 --> 37:43.387
I mean, it's a tale
as old as time.

37:43.420 --> 37:45.456
Or at least as old
as profe55ional sports.

37:45.490 --> 37:47.287
The sins of the entitled athlete

37:47.330 --> 37:49.548
being swept under the rug
by his enablers.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.420
I'm sure
Mr. Fontino's family

37:51.470 --> 37:54.394
will be enjoying
the blood money he's earning

37:54.440 --> 37:57.398
as soon as Houston Spivey's name
is called in the draft.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.465
Well, the lab says the blood
in Fontino's trunk

37:59.510 --> 38:00.704
was a match for the victims.

38:00.740 --> 38:02.537
And he knew about
the murder weapon.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.344
He knew about it, couldn't
produce it though, could he?

38:05.380 --> 38:07.575
He said he threw it off
the Staten Island Ferry.

38:07.610 --> 38:09.544
Yeah, another lie, no doubt.

38:09.580 --> 38:12.515
Look, I'll concede that he was
an accessory after the fact.

38:12.550 --> 38:13.710
I don't think
there's any coincidence

38:13.750 --> 38:14.956
that the bodies
were disposed of

38:14.990 --> 38:16.685
at his cousin's crematorium,

38:16.720 --> 38:19.723
but I refuse to believe
he's our killer.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.318
Then should've come
with me to the precinct

38:21.360 --> 38:23.328
instead of trying to dig up
more dirt on NYOOPI.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.396
Yes, I should have.

38:25.430 --> 38:26.795
Found what I need, though.

38:26.830 --> 38:28.866
What do you mean?
I mean,

38:28.900 --> 38:32.836
this time tomorrow,
NYOOPI will be no more.

38:32.870 --> 38:36.601
For what it's worth,
Fontino was a college pitcher.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.744
Yes, he was.
That was 45 years ago.

38:38.780 --> 38:40.805
Now he's a retiree
with a herniated disc

38:40.850 --> 38:42.545
and arthritis in both hands.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.582
I mean, he'd have trouble
lifting the murder weapon

38:44.620 --> 38:46.588
above his head, let alone
swinging it hard enough

38:46.620 --> 38:47.848
to send blood flying

38:47.890 --> 38:49.448
across the room.
(loud bang)

38:52.730 --> 38:54.357
That was the sound.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.822
What?

38:55.860 --> 38:57.418
A bang.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.996
Carter's neighbors said
they heard a noise that night,

38:59.030 --> 39:01.533
a bang.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.362
Thanks for coming
in, Mr. Spivey.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.401
I don't understand
why I'm here again.

39:08.440 --> 39:09.634
When I gave my statement
about Coach Fontino,

39:09.680 --> 39:11.545
my lavwer said that would be it.

39:11.580 --> 39:12.945
WATSON: He's right,
you don't have to say

39:12.980 --> 39:14.470
anything today.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.839
I'm just curious,
um, do you know

39:15.880 --> 39:17.973
what the worst pitch
you ever threw was?

39:18.020 --> 39:21.683
Uh, gave up a two-run double
in the playoffs last year.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.153
Hung a curve.

39:23.190 --> 39:24.452
Actually,

39:24.490 --> 39:26.526
it was when you
flung the murder weapon

39:26.560 --> 39:29.449
from the scene of the
double homicide you committed.

39:32.430 --> 39:34.398
(bang)
BELL: Two of
Carter Gibson's neighbors

39:34.440 --> 39:37.694
heard a bang like that the night
he and Fred Kirby were killed.

39:37.740 --> 39:39.537
They thought it was
a car backfiring.

39:39.570 --> 39:40.798
We wondered if maybe

39:40.840 --> 39:42.876
it was a gunshot.

39:42.910 --> 39:45.140
Turns out, it was the sound
of a perfect strike.

39:45.180 --> 39:46.477
GREGSON:
You left tracks

39:46.510 --> 39:48.512
at the scene.

39:48.550 --> 39:50.814
Bloody footprints
from Carter's door

39:50.850 --> 39:52.943
to your coach's car.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.810
Stood to reason
you took the murder weapon

39:54.860 --> 39:57.511
along with the bodies.

39:57.560 --> 39:58.788
Only you didn't.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.855
You threw it 245 feet

40:00.890 --> 40:02.448
into that Dumpster.

40:02.500 --> 40:03.899
WATSON :
It's pretty impressive.

40:03.930 --> 40:06.819
But like I said, it was
the worst pitch of your life.

40:06.870 --> 40:09.589
The blood of both victims
and your fingerprints

40:09.640 --> 40:10.493
are all over it.

40:10.540 --> 40:11.905
What happened?

40:11.940 --> 40:13.669
Did you think
you heard someone coming?

40:13.710 --> 40:16.099
You panicked, threw it
as far as you could?

40:20.650 --> 40:24.017
I'd like my lavwer now, please.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.752
Sherlock?

40:29.790 --> 40:31.018
(groans)

40:31.060 --> 40:32.687
Is that why
you called me down here,

40:32.730 --> 40:36.052
to troll me again for
enrolling us in NYOOPI?

40:36.100 --> 40:38.466
Gonna mark you down a point
for poor observational skills.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.489
Look more closely.

40:41.070 --> 40:43.061
WATSON:
"ESOOPI"?

40:46.140 --> 40:47.607
He has agreed to shutter
the organization,

40:47.640 --> 40:49.631
as I predicted
he would.

40:49.680 --> 40:53.104
But, like a phoenix
rising from the dung heap,

40:53.150 --> 40:56.119
a new trade organization has
been born to take its place:

40:56.150 --> 40:58.072
ESOOPI.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.247
The Empire State Order
of Private Investigators.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.087
All members of
the former NYOOPI

41:02.120 --> 41:03.883
will be allowed
to stay on.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.785
And Mr. Garmendia will be
retaining his position

41:05.830 --> 41:07.058
as president.

41:07.090 --> 41:08.853
Is that what you meant
when you said

41:08.900 --> 41:10.026
NYOOPI would be no more?

41:10.060 --> 41:11.823
So what's the point?

41:11.870 --> 41:13.519
Now there's a group
that's gonna be handing out

41:13.570 --> 41:15.094
gold stars
instead of silver ones?

41:15.140 --> 41:18.132
No. Nothing will be handed out.

41:18.170 --> 41:20.968
Gold stars and a listing on the
group's all-important Web site

41:21.010 --> 41:22.500
will be earned

41:22.540 --> 41:25.270
by members who complete a
course of my own design.

41:25.310 --> 41:28.177
It's compulsory, not optional.

41:28.210 --> 41:30.144
You really think
1,200 dues-paying members

41:30.180 --> 41:32.080
are gonna sit still
for that?

41:32.120 --> 41:34.179
I don't believe they're
gonna have a choice.

41:34.220 --> 41:35.687
I spent all of yesterday

41:35.720 --> 41:37.517
poring over the bylaws
that they agreed to

41:37.560 --> 41:39.926
when they joined;
NYOOPI is more than allowed

41:39.960 --> 41:42.224
to change its name
and its standards.

41:42.260 --> 41:43.898
And any members
that don't appreciate

41:43.930 --> 41:45.568
that kind of attention to detail

41:45.600 --> 41:47.124
will learn to.

41:47.170 --> 41:49.092
Or they'll forfeit
their membership.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.664
Is that...?

41:50.700 --> 41:52.304
The test, yes.

41:52.340 --> 41:55.002
I thought you would be honored
to be the first ESOOPI member

41:55.040 --> 41:56.029
to attempt it.

41:58.610 --> 42:00.999
"List three suitable methods
for determining the age

42:01.050 --> 42:02.574
of a fecal deposit on a..."

42:02.620 --> 42:04.110
This is the first question?

42:04.150 --> 42:06.243
Two hours, Watson.
(knocks on desk)

42:06.290 --> 42:07.746
Make me proud.

42:07.790 --> 42:11.055
*

42:11.090 --> 42:14.799
* Lurch around the room

42:14.830 --> 42:16.991
* You know you got the right.
