02:04.174 --> 02:06.176
How are you feeling,
from your accident?

02:06.676 --> 02:08.178
Fine.

02:08.678 --> 02:10.180
Thank you.

02:17.187 --> 02:19.189
Honestly?

02:19.189 --> 02:21.691
If you told me five
years ago i would
be sitting here today...

02:29.699 --> 02:32.202
anthony's attacks,
how do they make you feel?

02:34.204 --> 02:37.707
Well, concerned
of course.

02:37.707 --> 02:40.210
And helpless...

02:41.711 --> 02:44.714
a little
frustrated maybe.

02:45.215 --> 02:47.217
With your inability
to help him?

02:47.217 --> 02:49.719
To tell the truth,
i was referring to your
inability to help him.

02:51.221 --> 02:53.223
She has helped me.

02:53.723 --> 02:54.724
What are you
talking about?

02:55.225 --> 02:56.726
You've been coming here
for three years, tony.

02:56.726 --> 02:58.728
You still pass out
on a regular basis.

03:01.231 --> 03:03.733
I understand
your frustration.

03:03.733 --> 03:05.735
Did anthony share with you
any of our insights

03:06.236 --> 03:08.238
about his last
panic attack?

03:08.738 --> 03:10.240
I told you,
remember?

03:10.240 --> 03:11.741
The cappicola,

03:12.242 --> 03:14.244
and my mother
when i was little kid.

03:14.244 --> 03:15.745
Right, yes.

03:15.745 --> 03:18.248
Do you think tha
t there's anything

03:18.248 --> 03:20.750
in the prese
nt family dynamic

03:20.750 --> 03:23.253
that could serve
as a trigger?

03:23.253 --> 03:25.755
Something in you
r dialoguing perhaps?

03:25.755 --> 03:27.257
'Scuse me?

03:27.257 --> 03:28.758
I don't really
know you that well.

03:28.758 --> 03:32.262
We're trying to ge
t to root causes.

03:32.262 --> 03:34.264
Like maybe you
do things, you know,

03:34.264 --> 03:35.765
that have some
effect on me?

03:36.266 --> 03:37.767
Oh, really.

03:37.767 --> 03:39.269
What?

03:39.269 --> 03:41.271
People affect
each other in life.

03:41.271 --> 03:43.273
Oh, i get it,
is this how it works?

03:43.273 --> 03:45.275
You can't get any
answers out of him

03:45.275 --> 03:47.277
so you start looking
for someone else
to point the finger at?

03:47.777 --> 03:49.279
She's not
saying anything!

03:49.279 --> 03:51.281
Why are you gettin'
so defensive?

03:51.281 --> 03:52.782
You know what, tony?

03:52.782 --> 03:55.285
Maybe you should explore
your own behavior.

03:55.285 --> 03:58.288
Maybe you pass out because
you're guilty over something.

03:58.788 --> 04:01.791
Maybe the fact that
you stick your dick
into anything with a pulse.

04:01.791 --> 04:04.294
You ever thought of exploring
that as a root cause?

04:04.294 --> 04:05.795
Very nice,
that's very nice.

04:06.296 --> 04:07.797
Mm- hmm.

04:07.797 --> 04:09.799
I told you months ago
i broke it off with
that russian person.

04:09.799 --> 04:11.801
Right?

04:14.804 --> 04:15.805
It's incredible.

04:16.305 --> 04:17.807
It's like people who
smoke their whole lives

04:17.807 --> 04:20.310
and then they sue
the cigarette companies
when they get cancer.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.812
You know, you
agreed to come here.

04:22.812 --> 04:25.315
Forget it,
this is fuckin' ridiculous.

04:26.816 --> 04:28.318
Right,
just sit there

04:28.318 --> 04:31.821
silence, anger.

04:31.821 --> 04:34.824
Then you pass out
and you blame the rest
of the fucking world.

04:35.325 --> 04:36.826
Yeah,
i love you, too.

04:42.832 --> 04:44.834
You're both
very angry.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.836
You must've been in the top
of your fucking class.

04:56.346 --> 04:58.348
Ah, jesus christ.

05:01.351 --> 05:02.852
What?

05:05.355 --> 05:06.856
Great.

05:06.856 --> 05:09.359
And i'm the one that doesn't
fuckin' communicate?

05:09.359 --> 05:11.861
You want to know
what's wrong?

05:11.861 --> 05:15.865
After 19 years of marriage,
i find it very sad

05:15.865 --> 05:18.868
that we have to pay someone
to teach us how to interact.

05:18.868 --> 05:20.870
You were
all in favor.

05:22.872 --> 05:25.375
Slow down, stop driving
like a maniac.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.377
Maybe we'l
l fucking die.

05:27.377 --> 05:29.379
You think this is
easy for me?

05:29.379 --> 05:30.880
It's like being
the new kid at school,

05:30.880 --> 05:32.882
everybody jumps down
your throat every time
you open your mouth.

05:33.383 --> 05:34.384
Who's picking
on you?

05:34.384 --> 05:36.386
She took your side
with everything you said.

05:36.386 --> 05:37.887
Will you, please?

05:37.887 --> 05:40.390
I'm sure you'll have
a good laugh about it
the next time you're alone.

05:40.390 --> 05:41.891
Yeah.

05:43.893 --> 05:45.895
Oh, motherfuckin' fuck!

05:46.396 --> 05:47.397
God!

05:47.897 --> 05:49.399
Jesus christ.

06:03.413 --> 06:05.415
Are you happy now,
what did i tell you?

06:05.415 --> 06:07.917
It's a fuckin'
speed trap.

06:11.421 --> 06:13.923
How you doing?

06:13.923 --> 06:16.926
I got new shoes,
soles are a little heavy.

06:16.926 --> 06:18.928
License, registratio
n, and insurance card please.

06:23.933 --> 06:26.936
You're with
the township, right?

06:26.936 --> 06:29.939
I think i had dinner
with your boss last week.

06:29.939 --> 06:31.441
Tony soprano.

06:31.441 --> 06:33.943
Would you please remove
the license from the wallet?

06:44.454 --> 06:46.456
Do you know wh
y i stopped you, sir?

06:46.956 --> 06:48.458
Yeah, i do.

06:48.458 --> 06:49.459
I'll tell you what,

06:49.959 --> 06:51.461
why don't you and your
wife have dinner on me

06:51.461 --> 06:53.463
and you can
tell her about it.

06:53.963 --> 06:55.465
Are you offering m
e a bribe, sir?

06:55.465 --> 06:57.467
Of course not.

06:57.467 --> 06:59.469
You gotta
relax a little.

06:59.469 --> 07:01.971
Would you shut the
engine please, sir?

07:03.973 --> 07:05.975
Just out of
curiosity,

07:05.975 --> 07:08.978
what happens if
i don't feel like
shutting the engine?

07:08.978 --> 07:11.481
Dispatch 5- 8- 2
, request back- up.

07:11.481 --> 07:13.483
You gotta be
fuckin' kidding me.

07:13.483 --> 07:14.984
Tony.

07:14.984 --> 07:16.986
5- 8- 2, what's your 20?

07:23.493 --> 07:25.495
Dispatch,
cancel back- up.

07:25.495 --> 07:26.996
This the high point
of your career?

07:27.497 --> 07:28.498
Wait in the car.

07:37.507 --> 07:40.009
Our tax dollars
hard at fuckin' work.

07:40.009 --> 07:41.511
It makes you sick.

07:41.511 --> 07:43.513
You'd think they'd be out
arresting dope dealers.

07:46.015 --> 07:47.517
You believ
e this shit?

07:47.517 --> 07:50.019
This fuckin' smoke's
actually writing me up.

07:50.019 --> 07:52.021
Stay in
the car, tony.

07:52.021 --> 07:55.024
Affirmative action
cocksucker.

08:05.535 --> 08:06.536
What'd freddie
want again?

08:07.036 --> 08:08.538
I don't know,
peppers and eggs.

08:08.538 --> 08:10.540
C'mon, help me
carry that shit.

08:10.540 --> 08:11.541
Nah, i saw
a meter maid.

08:12.041 --> 08:13.543
Bullshit.

08:14.043 --> 08:16.546
Get me a manhattan special
if they got it, instead of
the coke, alright?

08:16.546 --> 08:18.548
How the fuck
should i know?

08:19.048 --> 08:20.550
Bullshit, every time
i hear your machine,

08:21.050 --> 08:22.051
there's some new
motherfucker on it!

08:22.552 --> 08:24.554
Fuck you, you shouldn't be
listening to my machine,
you loser!

08:25.054 --> 08:26.055
Shut your mouth!

08:26.055 --> 08:28.057
You know what?
Fuck you.

08:28.057 --> 08:30.059
Don't call me
anymore!

08:31.561 --> 08:34.063
Get back in the
goddamn car!

08:34.563 --> 08:36.566
You think you can give
me a ride up to the point?

08:36.566 --> 08:38.568
What the fuck
are you lookin' at?

08:39.068 --> 08:40.570
Uh, we're on a
job in teaneck.

08:40.570 --> 08:42.071
C'mon,
it's two minutes.

08:42.071 --> 08:44.073
Fuckin' twat,

08:44.073 --> 08:45.575
Eat sh

08:45.575 --> 08:48.578
C'mon, can't you just

08:48.578 --> 08:50.079
Look, why don't yo

08:50.079 --> 08:51.581
C'mon, can't you
just take me?

08:51.581 --> 08:54.584
I can't, there's
a car service...

08:54.584 --> 08:56.085
sal!

08:56.586 --> 08:58.087
Fat piece of shit!

08:58.588 --> 08:59.589
He didn't

08:59.589 --> 09:01.090
C'mon, you wanna
fuck her?

09:01.591 --> 09:03.593
Sal, what are you doin'?
Stop, he didn't do anything!

09:03.593 --> 09:06.095
Sal, what are
you doing?
Stop!

09:06.095 --> 09:08.097
Get back

09:08.097 --> 09:09.599
Get in the car!

09:10.099 --> 09:12.101
Get in the
fucking car now!

09:21.611 --> 09:23.112
Bryan, bryan!

09:29.619 --> 09:31.120
Hey.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.623
How are ya?

09:33.623 --> 09:35.124
Thanks for
comin', tony.

09:35.124 --> 09:37.126
How you doing?

09:39.629 --> 09:40.630
Hey.

09:43.132 --> 09:45.635
I brought hi
m some whitman's.

09:48.137 --> 09:49.639
How's he doing?

09:49.639 --> 09:53.142
I talked to him before,
i think he squeezed
my hand, but...

09:53.643 --> 09:55.645
he's gonna be
a vegetable, tony.

09:55.645 --> 09:57.647
A fucking retard.

09:57.647 --> 09:59.649
No, he's gonna
be fine.

09:59.649 --> 10:01.150
Look at
the bright side...

10:01.150 --> 10:04.153
he wasn't that smart
to begin with.

10:04.153 --> 10:06.656
C'mon, it's
a tense situation.

10:06.656 --> 10:08.157
A little fucking
levity, huh?

10:10.159 --> 10:12.161
What are
you doin' here?

10:12.161 --> 10:14.664
I can't
visit my cousin?

10:14.664 --> 10:19.168
I want this cocksucker t
o bleed from his ass, skipper.

10:19.168 --> 10:21.671
You got it.

10:21.671 --> 10:23.673
Just say the word,
my fuckin' pleasure.

10:23.673 --> 10:25.675
Why don't you go
grab us some coffee?

10:25.675 --> 10:27.677
C'mon, are you
kiddin'?

10:29.679 --> 10:31.180
Better yet,

10:31.180 --> 10:33.683
go to the ear, nos
e, and throat department,

10:33.683 --> 10:36.185
get your
hearing checked.

10:44.193 --> 10:46.195
Alright, obviously
you told the cops

10:46.195 --> 10:47.697
you don't kn
ow who did this?

10:47.697 --> 10:49.198
I'm upset,

10:49.198 --> 10:52.201
but please, i know
how to keep my mouth shut.

10:52.702 --> 10:54.704
Unless, of course, there's
a salami sandwich around.

10:55.204 --> 10:56.706
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

10:56.706 --> 10:58.207
We're trying to have
a meeting here.

10:58.708 --> 11:01.210
Two minutes he's in charge,
he's fucking lee iacocca.

11:04.213 --> 11:05.715
C'mon.

11:06.215 --> 11:07.717
Not here,
c'mon.

11:12.722 --> 11:15.224
There's no beef
between your broth
er and mustang sally?

11:15.725 --> 11:17.727
Didn't owe him any money,
nothing like that?

11:17.727 --> 11:19.729
No, nothing.

11:19.729 --> 11:21.230
This kid's
a whack job.

11:21.230 --> 11:22.732
Meadowlands,
last year,
remember?

11:23.232 --> 11:26.235
Threw a hot dog vendor
off the second mezzanine?

11:26.235 --> 11:28.237
Too many fuckin' onions
or some shit.

11:30.740 --> 11:35.244
Geeg', you'll get him
under control?

11:35.244 --> 11:38.247
With extreme
fuckin' prejudice.

11:39.749 --> 11:41.250
We gotta go.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.752
Alright.

11:42.752 --> 11:44.253
Ton'.

11:44.253 --> 11:45.755
Hey...

11:46.255 --> 11:47.757
he's gonna be fine.

11:47.757 --> 11:50.259
Thanks, tony.

12:16.285 --> 12:18.788
"And if i go and
prepare a place for you,

12:18.788 --> 12:22.792
"i will come back again
and take you to myself,

12:23.292 --> 12:27.296
so that where i am,
you may also be."

12:28.798 --> 12:31.300
This is
the word of the lord.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.302
Thanks be to god.

12:36.305 --> 12:39.809
There are many rooms
in my father's house...

12:39.809 --> 12:42.812
most certainly
one for febby.

12:42.812 --> 12:45.815
Febby lived
a full life,

12:45.815 --> 12:48.317
a life of service
to others.

12:48.317 --> 12:50.820
His 78 years saw him

12:50.820 --> 12:53.823
serve his family
as a devoted father,

12:54.323 --> 12:58.327
his country as
a supply sergeant
in the pacific theater,

12:58.327 --> 13:03.833
and most importantly, our
lord, as a devout catholic.

13:03.833 --> 13:07.336
When i last visited febby
in the hospital,

13:07.336 --> 13:11.340
he had just finished
his last round
of chemotherapy.

13:11.340 --> 13:13.843
Though frail
and extremely thin,

13:13.843 --> 13:16.345
his fighting spirit
was still intact.

13:16.345 --> 13:18.848
His body was
wracked with pain...

13:23.352 --> 13:25.354
you know
greg d'aiuto?

13:25.354 --> 13:27.356
His grandfather
died of cancer.

13:27.356 --> 13:29.358
They froze his head
till they find a cure.

13:29.859 --> 13:32.361
Mary...
carmela.

13:34.363 --> 13:36.365
Hugh, hugh!

13:39.368 --> 13:40.369
Oh.

13:40.870 --> 13:42.872
For the poor box.

13:42.872 --> 13:44.373
Thank you.

13:44.373 --> 13:45.875
I'm goin' to
check out the hearse.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.877
Don't
get lost, a. J.

13:54.884 --> 13:58.888
Well, i'll
see ya at the...

14:01.891 --> 14:03.392
see ya,
father.

14:06.395 --> 14:08.898
C'mere, you,
let me look at you.

14:08.898 --> 14:11.400
Hey, c'mere!

14:12.401 --> 14:14.904
Why didn't you tell me
your old man was coming?

14:14.904 --> 14:16.405
He wanted
to surprise you.

14:16.405 --> 14:18.407
You mean
old prick.

14:18.407 --> 14:20.409
I thought you were in miami
playing shuffleboard.

14:20.409 --> 14:22.411
It's too hot there.

14:22.411 --> 14:25.414
I come up to see
the grandkids, you know?

14:25.414 --> 14:26.916
And my
doctor's here.

14:26.916 --> 14:29.418
Yeah, bobby said
you weren't feeling too good.

14:29.418 --> 14:30.920
How you doin'?

14:30.920 --> 14:32.922
I'm gonna brin
g the car around.

14:32.922 --> 14:34.924
I'm sorry abou
t your uncle.

14:35.424 --> 14:38.427
Actually febby
was carmela's uncle.

14:38.427 --> 14:39.929
Buon anima,

14:39.929 --> 14:41.430
he should
rest in peace.

14:41.430 --> 14:43.933
94 pounds when he died
, carm's mom was saying.

14:44.433 --> 14:46.435
He was always thin,
what do you expect?

14:48.437 --> 14:50.940
As long as
i got you here...

14:50.940 --> 14:54.443
your godson,
mustang sally intile,

14:54.443 --> 14:56.946
he did a lee trevino
off a guy's head.

14:56.946 --> 14:59.949
That little prick is
my godson in name only.

14:59.949 --> 15:02.451
I only stood up as a
favor to his father.

15:02.451 --> 15:04.954
I'm just saying
'cause...

15:04.954 --> 15:07.957
this isn't
the first time.

15:07.957 --> 15:10.960
You do whatever
you gotta do.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.463
Just so you
heard it from me.

15:14.463 --> 15:15.965
Thank you.

15:16.465 --> 15:18.968
And i want you to know
that i appreciate
you looking out for bobby.

15:18.968 --> 15:21.470
Bobby, what,
are you kidding me?

15:21.470 --> 15:23.472
He's been a huge help
with my uncle.

15:23.973 --> 15:25.474
That one don't
need any help.

15:25.975 --> 15:28.978
Out of jail
on a fuckin' medical?

15:29.979 --> 15:32.481
He makes me laugh,
your uncle.

15:34.483 --> 15:37.486
That's right,
we're talking about you,
you cagey fuck.

15:37.486 --> 15:38.487
Huh?

15:38.487 --> 15:40.489
You got'e
m all fooled.

15:40.489 --> 15:41.490
Yeah,
that's right.

15:43.492 --> 15:44.994
There's bobby.

15:44.994 --> 15:46.996
I'm sorry
for your loss.

15:46.996 --> 15:48.998
See you later.

15:54.503 --> 15:56.005
Hey, hey, hey.

15:56.005 --> 15:58.007
What the fuck,
he's really sick?

15:58.007 --> 15:59.508
That cough.

15:59.508 --> 16:00.509
What do you want?

16:01.010 --> 16:03.012
He smoked those camels
since he's in short pants.

16:03.012 --> 16:04.513
Lung cancer?

16:04.513 --> 16:06.015
Oh, fuck.

16:06.515 --> 16:08.017
Another toothpick.

16:08.517 --> 16:11.020
What the hell kind of way
is that to talk about
a sick person?

16:16.025 --> 16:17.526
Goodnight now.

16:18.027 --> 16:19.528
Goodnight.

16:19.528 --> 16:21.030
Thank you.

16:28.037 --> 16:30.539
42 years...
my god.

16:32.041 --> 16:35.044
When it's righ
t it's right.

16:35.044 --> 16:38.547
We said we'd save the barolo
for a big night?

16:38.547 --> 16:42.551
Check out
these numbers.

16:42.551 --> 16:44.053
Heh?

16:44.053 --> 16:46.055
Oh, my god,
i knew we were busy--

16:46.055 --> 16:47.556
not bad, eh?

16:52.561 --> 16:56.065
I think i'm gonna pass
on the wine tonight.

16:58.067 --> 17:01.570
A night like this you're
gonna make me drink alone?

17:01.570 --> 17:04.573
What is it,
you okay?

17:07.076 --> 17:09.078
Actually...

17:09.578 --> 17:11.579
you know i love it here
and you're a great boss,

17:12.080 --> 17:15.584
but christopher doesn't
want me working anymore.

17:15.584 --> 17:18.587
Please
don't be mad.

17:18.587 --> 17:20.589
No, i'm not
mad at all.

17:20.589 --> 17:22.590
I'm happy for you.

17:22.590 --> 17:24.593
You know, with
his change in situation.

17:24.593 --> 17:26.095
You know
how he is.

17:26.095 --> 17:28.597
You think i wanna
be stuck in this prison?

17:28.597 --> 17:31.100
I really wanted
to give you notice,

17:31.100 --> 17:34.603
i was supposed to
tell you two weeks ago.

17:34.603 --> 17:38.107
But is it alright
if tonight's my last night?

17:38.107 --> 17:42.111
Yeah, i guess i'll get
charmaine to cover.

17:42.111 --> 17:44.613
Thank you!

17:44.613 --> 17:46.615
I was so nervous
about telling you.

17:49.118 --> 17:51.620
Christopher's picking me up,
so i'm gonna go fix my makeup.

17:52.121 --> 17:53.122
Okay.

17:53.122 --> 17:55.124
Of course.

18:13.642 --> 18:15.644
You're not
gonna jump me?

18:16.145 --> 18:17.646
What?

18:17.646 --> 18:20.149
I'm open here,
i'll have to king you.

18:22.151 --> 18:24.153
Fuck it,
i don't wanna play.

18:25.654 --> 18:27.656
I don't really
wanna either.

18:30.659 --> 18:33.162
What's with you
? all day, gloomy gus.

18:33.662 --> 18:35.664
Sorry, it's just...

18:35.664 --> 18:38.167
it's my father.

18:38.167 --> 18:41.670
He's a tough man, he'l
l beat the fuckin' thing.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.672
It's not the cancer,
it's tony.

18:43.672 --> 18:45.674
Tony?
Well, what about him?

18:45.674 --> 18:48.177
Stop speaking
in anagrams.

18:48.177 --> 18:51.180
He okayed my dad to do
the hit on mustang sally.

18:51.180 --> 18:53.182
The prick put that
spatafore kid in a coma.

18:53.682 --> 18:54.683
Fuck sally.

18:54.683 --> 18:57.186
I'm worried about my father,
he can't do this.

18:57.186 --> 18:59.188
He's been retired
for seven years.

18:59.188 --> 19:00.689
What's this we're in,
the navy?

19:00.689 --> 19:02.691
It's not that.

19:02.691 --> 19:05.694
This was
a proud man, junior.

19:05.694 --> 19:08.697
He's over
the other night,

19:09.198 --> 19:12.701
i had to help him off
the toilet he's so weak.

19:14.203 --> 19:16.205
Will you shut the fuck up
with the toilets?

19:16.205 --> 19:18.207
All this
goddamn morbidity?

19:23.712 --> 19:26.715
I'm sorry,
you're right.

19:26.715 --> 19:29.218
Fuck.

19:29.218 --> 19:31.220
At this point
in a man's life

19:31.220 --> 19:33.722
to have him
do something like this.

19:33.722 --> 19:36.725
You know i never ask
you for anything.

19:36.725 --> 19:39.228
You could tell tony
i'll do it myself if he wants.

19:39.728 --> 19:42.231
Fuck what he wants,
i'm still the boss
of this family.

19:42.731 --> 19:44.233
You're right.

19:44.233 --> 19:46.735
I'm sorry.

19:46.735 --> 19:48.737
Stop your crying
, i'll tell him.

19:48.737 --> 19:51.240
Making me fucking
depressed now.

19:53.242 --> 19:54.743
Old man bacala's
okay with this,

19:54.743 --> 19:56.745
what do you
give a shit anyway?

19:56.745 --> 19:59.748
What is it with you
and these power trips?

19:59.748 --> 20:01.250
What the fuck are you
talking about?

20:02.751 --> 20:04.253
Pardon me...

20:04.253 --> 20:05.754
may i?

20:06.255 --> 20:07.256
Yeah.

20:10.759 --> 20:13.262
Your girl got
any coffee out there?

20:13.262 --> 20:15.764
I think we can
rustle some up.

20:15.764 --> 20:19.768
Tax code,
another client,
irs troubles.

20:19.768 --> 20:21.770
Sorry, mel.

20:21.770 --> 20:24.773
To find a place they're
not allowed to bug...

20:24.773 --> 20:28.277
dr. Schreck's office
has a full waiting room.

20:28.277 --> 20:30.779
I sit
too much anyway.

20:36.285 --> 20:38.787
It has to be
the old man, huh?

20:38.787 --> 20:40.289
There's no other way?

20:40.289 --> 20:42.791
There's a million other ways,
but this one'll work.

20:42.791 --> 20:44.793
It was gigi's idea,

20:44.793 --> 20:46.295
i'm not cutting
his fuckin' balls off.

20:48.797 --> 20:51.300
Mustang sally's m. I. A.

20:51.300 --> 20:54.303
Two days ago he reaches out
to old man bacala for help.

20:54.303 --> 20:56.305
Old man bacala's
his godfather.

20:56.305 --> 20:59.808
He can get close
without arousin' suspicion.

21:00.309 --> 21:02.311
It still
doesn't sit right.

21:02.311 --> 21:03.812
He's done it
a thousand times.

21:03.812 --> 21:05.314
He's a sick old man!

21:05.314 --> 21:07.316
Good, it'll give him
something to live for.

21:15.324 --> 21:17.326
So i told him,

21:17.826 --> 21:18.827
i'd take those
duncan shiek records

21:18.827 --> 21:20.829
and shove'e
m up his ass.

21:22.331 --> 21:25.834
Wait a minute,
who let this one in here?

21:25.834 --> 21:27.336
Oh, wolfgang fuckface.

21:29.838 --> 21:31.840
Hey, artie.

21:36.345 --> 21:39.848
The man wh
o stole her away.

21:42.351 --> 21:44.353
Adriana,
she gave her notice.

21:56.865 --> 21:58.367
Help yourself.

22:01.870 --> 22:04.373
You better be good
to that girl...

22:04.373 --> 22:06.875
you cocksucker.

22:06.875 --> 22:09.378
No wonder
the food sucks.

22:09.378 --> 22:11.880
You're supposed to cook
with the wine, artie.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.382
Three years...

22:13.382 --> 22:16.385
best hoste
ss i ever had,

22:16.885 --> 22:19.388
this piece of shit
steals her away.

22:19.388 --> 22:20.889
Artie, c'mon.

22:20.889 --> 22:23.392
Ah, c'mon, he know
s i'm breaking his balls.

22:23.392 --> 22:24.893
Alright.

22:28.897 --> 22:31.900
Seriously though,
i'm you?

22:32.401 --> 22:34.403
I'd hire
a food taster.

22:34.403 --> 22:36.905
You don't want to fuck
with a chef, my friend.

22:36.905 --> 22:38.407
What?

22:38.907 --> 22:40.409
You think you're
the only one who knows
how to swing a meat cleaver?

22:40.909 --> 22:41.910
Fuck you.

22:41.910 --> 22:43.412
Artie...

22:44.413 --> 22:45.914
i'm kidding, huh?

22:47.916 --> 22:50.419
Wanna try cooking
with one fuckin' eye?

22:50.419 --> 22:51.920
That's enough!

22:51.920 --> 22:53.922
Go wait outside!

22:55.424 --> 22:56.925
Now!

23:10.439 --> 23:11.940
What the fuck?

23:11.940 --> 23:14.443
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

23:14.443 --> 23:16.445
She's his
fuckin' fiancee!

23:16.445 --> 23:17.946
I loved her.

23:17.946 --> 23:20.449
I fuckin'
love her now.

23:28.457 --> 23:30.459
Artie...

23:30.459 --> 23:32.461
do me a favor.

23:32.461 --> 23:35.464
Don't ever fuckin'
say that again
to anybody ever.

23:35.464 --> 23:37.966
What am i,
a joke?

23:38.967 --> 23:42.471
Yeah, a stupid
fuckin' bald one.

23:42.471 --> 23:44.973
Not to mention
married.

23:46.975 --> 23:48.477
Can i tell
you something?

23:50.479 --> 23:51.980
She's a cunt.

23:52.481 --> 23:54.483
My fuckin' wife.

23:54.483 --> 23:58.487
A girl like ad
e, that's a woman.

23:58.487 --> 24:00.989
If i still
had my hair...

24:00.989 --> 24:01.990
artie,
she's a young girl.

24:01.990 --> 24:03.992
You could have hair like
fuckin' casey kasem,

24:03.992 --> 24:05.994
it won't
make a difference.

24:05.994 --> 24:07.496
Yeah.

24:16.505 --> 24:18.507
Look,
go in the back,

24:18.507 --> 24:20.509
get some coffee,

24:20.509 --> 24:23.512
go home,
go the fuck to sleep.

24:24.012 --> 24:25.514
I should
go apologize.

24:25.514 --> 24:28.517
Not right now.

24:28.517 --> 24:30.018
Let me
talk to chris.

24:30.018 --> 24:32.020
You go home.

24:35.524 --> 24:37.025
Call me tomorrow.

24:37.526 --> 24:41.029
I got a business opportunity
over in newark.

24:46.535 --> 24:48.537
Jesus fuckin' christ.

25:03.051 --> 25:05.053
Mr. Spears for you
on three.

25:05.053 --> 25:07.055
Seth,
i gotta take this.

25:07.055 --> 25:09.057
Alright.

25:10.559 --> 25:12.561
Hey.

25:12.561 --> 25:14.563
So, what's the story with
this fuckin' speedin' ticket?

25:14.563 --> 25:16.064
What?
I'm on it,
i told you.

25:16.064 --> 25:17.566
I just got some fuckin'
letter in the mail.

25:17.566 --> 25:19.067
Throw it out,
forget it.

25:19.568 --> 25:21.069
What the fuck, i gotta call
my guy down at the dmv

25:21.570 --> 25:22.571
to get
this squashed?

25:23.071 --> 25:24.573
I told you, it's
a deplorable situation

25:24.573 --> 25:27.075
and i'll take
care of it.

25:27.075 --> 25:30.078
Hey, good news about the
riverfront esplanade thing.

25:30.078 --> 25:31.079
We still on for thursday?

25:31.580 --> 25:34.082
Just straighten
the fuckin' ticket out, okay?

25:40.589 --> 25:42.090
Where's your father?

25:42.090 --> 25:44.092
He called,
he stopped by the bakery,

25:44.092 --> 25:46.595
wanted to pick up
a shortcake.

25:46.595 --> 25:49.097
He never comes
empty handed.

25:54.102 --> 25:56.104
Talk to tony?

25:56.104 --> 25:58.607
No, i decided
against it.

25:58.607 --> 26:01.109
I didn't
even call him.

26:01.109 --> 26:03.612
You choose this life,
it comes with
responsibilities, bobby.

26:03.612 --> 26:06.114
Nobody knows that
better than your old man.

26:06.114 --> 26:07.616
I was asking
for me.

26:07.616 --> 26:09.618
Teddy roosevelt gave
an entire speech once

26:09.618 --> 26:11.620
with a bullet
lodged in his chest.

26:11.620 --> 26:14.122
Some things are
a matter of duty.

26:35.143 --> 26:36.645
Sonofabitch.

26:43.652 --> 26:44.653
Are you alright?

26:44.653 --> 26:46.154
I'm fine...

26:46.154 --> 26:47.155
fucking steps.

26:47.656 --> 26:48.657
Here,
sit down.

26:48.657 --> 26:50.659
Jesus.

26:57.165 --> 26:59.167
Fuck,
is that blood?

26:59.668 --> 27:01.670
Jesus christ,
call a fuckin' doctor.

27:02.170 --> 27:04.172
No, no, no.

27:04.172 --> 27:06.174
It's the nodules
in his lungs,

27:06.174 --> 27:07.676
it happens whe
n he's out of breath.

27:10.679 --> 27:14.182
Blessed saint dennis,
is this what it comes to?

27:14.182 --> 27:17.185
Get him some water
for chrissake!

27:17.185 --> 27:19.688
These doctors,
what are they doing for him?

27:19.688 --> 27:22.190
I don't know,
whatever theydo.

27:22.691 --> 27:23.692
Water.

27:23.692 --> 27:25.193
I want you
to call john kennedy,

27:25.193 --> 27:26.695
he's the head of oncology
at saint barnabas.

27:26.695 --> 27:29.698
Junior, i'm happy
with my guy.

27:30.198 --> 27:31.199
What the fuck
is he doing?

27:31.199 --> 27:32.701
Are you
taking the chemo?

27:33.201 --> 27:34.703
Is he giving you
oxygen therapy?

27:34.703 --> 27:39.207
The cure's worse than
the fuckin' illness.

27:41.710 --> 27:43.712
Cocksucker!
This is an outrage!

27:43.712 --> 27:46.715
He can't have you clip
someone in this condition!

27:48.216 --> 27:50.719
Junior,
i wanna do it.

27:50.719 --> 27:52.721
Eight years
sitting on my ass.

27:52.721 --> 27:55.724
It'll feel good
feelin' useful for a change.

27:55.724 --> 27:57.726
This sally's
a tough kid, bobby,

27:57.726 --> 27:59.227
what if things
don't go your way?

27:59.227 --> 28:01.730
If they don't,
they don't.

28:01.730 --> 28:04.733
What the fuck?
I'm dead anyway.

28:14.242 --> 28:16.745
Paul newman starte
d with the salad dressing,

28:16.745 --> 28:18.246
now they're over
a hundred million a year.

28:18.246 --> 28:20.749
And you know
how people love my sauce.

28:20.749 --> 28:23.251
Arthur,
you run a restaurant.

28:23.251 --> 28:27.255
What do you know
about mass production?

28:27.255 --> 28:30.258
I have an associate's
in business, for god's sake.

28:30.759 --> 28:33.762
How are we gonna gro
w if we don't take risks?

28:33.762 --> 28:37.265
Going into business
with a gangster isn't a risk.

28:37.265 --> 28:40.268
That is
a guaranteed disaster.

28:40.268 --> 28:41.269
It's legitimate.

28:41.269 --> 28:44.773
It's part of
the revitalization.

28:44.773 --> 28:46.775
The city of newark
is giving tax breaks

28:46.775 --> 28:48.777
for re- openi
ng old factories.

28:48.777 --> 28:50.278
I'm trying to
work here, artie.

28:50.278 --> 28:51.780
Fuck the vegetables.

28:51.780 --> 28:53.782
We have a chance to
have our own company,

28:53.782 --> 28:55.283
our own line
of products.

28:55.283 --> 28:57.285
Then why is it
called "satriale's"?

28:57.285 --> 28:59.287
The pork store
has a customer base,

28:59.287 --> 29:01.289
name recognition.

29:01.289 --> 29:03.291
Vesuvio doesn't?

29:03.291 --> 29:07.295
Your grandfather
opened up in the 30s,

29:07.295 --> 29:08.797
arthur.

29:08.797 --> 29:10.298
Tony talked to thi
s marketing- research guy.

29:10.298 --> 29:12.801
Product branding
s beginning with
the letter "v"

29:12.801 --> 29:14.803
make people think
of vagina.

29:14.803 --> 29:16.304
It's a turn- off.

29:16.304 --> 29:19.307
What did you
just say?

29:19.307 --> 29:20.809
Vaseline,
etcetera.

29:21.309 --> 29:22.811
The whol
e thing is...

29:22.811 --> 29:24.813
can't you see
the opportunities here?

29:24.813 --> 29:26.815
Yes, to be a front
for a mobster.

29:27.315 --> 29:28.817
Jesus christ,
already!

29:28.817 --> 29:30.819
Oh, when are you
gonna learn, huh?

29:30.819 --> 29:33.321
Be happy in
thine own self.

29:39.327 --> 29:41.329
The dvd's
incredible.

29:41.830 --> 29:43.331
Flat screen,
right?

29:43.331 --> 29:44.833
Fuckin' surround sound.

29:44.833 --> 29:47.335
"In this world
or the next,

29:47.836 --> 29:50.338
i shall have
my revenge."

29:50.839 --> 29:51.840
Here we go.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.341
No, i'm
telling you,

29:53.341 --> 29:55.343
it's like the chariots
are goin' through

29:55.844 --> 29:56.845
the fuckin' house.

29:56.845 --> 29:58.346
Skateboards,
don't i know.

29:58.346 --> 30:00.849
Sweetheart,
more water, please.

30:00.849 --> 30:02.350
So, what's
this i hear,

30:02.851 --> 30:04.352
you got old man bacala
makin' a comeback?

30:07.856 --> 30:10.358
He didn't hear i
t from me, 'ton.

30:10.358 --> 30:12.360
Hey, i'm not tryin'
to butt in.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.362
Junior reached out,
asked me to talk to you.

30:14.863 --> 30:16.865
My old man worked
for him a lotta years,

30:16.865 --> 30:18.366
he's just looking
out for him.

30:18.366 --> 30:20.368
It does seem
a little extreme,

30:20.368 --> 30:22.871
but, hey,
my man, gigootz,

30:22.871 --> 30:24.372
he knows what
he's doing, huh?

30:24.372 --> 30:26.374
Glad i have your
fuckin' approval.

30:26.374 --> 30:28.376
Whatever
you say, cappy.

30:30.378 --> 30:31.880
Alright,
here it is,
okay?

30:32.380 --> 30:34.883
For you, junior and
anybody the fuck else.

30:34.883 --> 30:37.886
Gigi's captain
of that crew.

30:37.886 --> 30:40.388
He gave the order,
i okayed it.

30:40.889 --> 30:42.390
End of fuckin' story.

30:43.892 --> 30:45.894
Tony, please,
no offense.

30:45.894 --> 30:47.896
Obviously,
it's your call.

30:47.896 --> 30:49.397
Yeah, obviously.

31:00.909 --> 31:02.911
What?

31:02.911 --> 31:04.412
Nothin'.

31:04.412 --> 31:06.915
It's just,
you know,

31:06.915 --> 31:09.417
sending
an old man,

31:09.417 --> 31:12.420
what's he gonna do?
Gum the guy to death?

31:12.420 --> 31:13.922
Anybody ask
for your input?

31:14.422 --> 31:16.424
No, no, i'm
just saying...

31:16.424 --> 31:18.927
you should
let me doit.

31:20.929 --> 31:23.431
I'll take this guy
apart at the joints,

31:23.431 --> 31:25.433
with him conscious.

31:58.967 --> 32:00.468
We got all kinds...

32:10.478 --> 32:12.480
ho, it's shaft.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.482
What are you,
here on a stakeout?

32:14.482 --> 32:17.485
May i help you
with something?

32:17.485 --> 32:19.988
Yeah, i need
a piece of this,
about this long.

32:19.988 --> 32:21.489
Unless you wanna come
over to my house,

32:21.489 --> 32:22.991
check on my birdbath.

32:22.991 --> 32:24.993
Make sure it's
up to code first.

32:24.993 --> 32:26.995
I'll check
the computer.

32:38.506 --> 32:40.508
Hey, get your
ticket book.

32:40.508 --> 32:43.011
Doesn't that constitute
indecent exposure?

32:43.011 --> 32:46.014
Actually, i no lon
ger need my ticket book.

32:46.014 --> 32:48.016
Your friend,
the assemblyman,

32:48.016 --> 32:51.019
saw to it
i was transferred
to the property room.

32:51.019 --> 32:53.521
So, you're no longer
the scourge of cedar grove?

32:53.521 --> 32:56.024
Nor am i eligible
for overtime.

32:56.024 --> 32:58.526
Leon, take your
break at two.

33:04.032 --> 33:07.535
Well, not that it matters,
just so you know,

33:07.535 --> 33:09.537
i didn't tell him to do
any of that shit.

33:13.041 --> 33:16.044
That was v
ery kind of you.

33:16.044 --> 33:18.046
We're out of stock.

33:25.553 --> 33:27.555
Tony!

33:27.555 --> 33:29.057
Tony, the phone!

33:29.057 --> 33:31.059
Alright, jesus!

33:31.559 --> 33:32.560
He'll be
right with you.

33:35.063 --> 33:36.064
Who is it?

33:36.564 --> 33:37.565
I don't know.

33:37.565 --> 33:39.067
I'm goin

33:39.067 --> 33:40.568
When are you

33:40.568 --> 33:42.570
When i'm done.

33:46.074 --> 33:47.075
Hello.

33:47.075 --> 33:48.076
It's ron.

33:48.076 --> 33:50.078
Oh, yeah, yeah,

33:52.080 --> 33:54.082

33:54.082 --> 33:55.583

the traffic cop?

33:55.583 --> 33:57.085
It's done,
it's alrea
dy taken care of.

33:57.085 --> 33:59.587
I know, i know,
it's just...

34:00.588 --> 34:02.090
i don't know.

34:02.590 --> 34:04.092
You got him busted
off the street?

34:04.092 --> 34:06.094
Fuck him, isn't that
what you wanted?

34:06.094 --> 34:10.098
Yeah, but, it's
kinda harsh, no?

34:10.098 --> 34:12.600
Tony, i spoke to
his unit commander.

34:13.101 --> 34:15.603
Nobody likes the guy,
he's a goddamn
rabble- rouser.

34:15.603 --> 34:18.106
Yeah, maybe, but...

34:18.106 --> 34:19.607
i don't know.

34:19.607 --> 34:21.109
Believe me,
it goes beyond you.

34:21.109 --> 34:23.610
The guy's depresse
d, he's all wound up.

34:23.610 --> 34:24.612
They think
he might have

34:24.612 --> 34:26.114
some serious
mental problems.

34:50.638 --> 34:52.139
Cocksucker.

34:59.147 --> 35:01.149
You're
a liar!

35:09.657 --> 35:10.658
The old man?

35:10.658 --> 35:12.160
I don't know,
what's he look like?

35:12.160 --> 35:14.162
Like an ol
d fuckin' man.

35:14.162 --> 35:16.164
He's all
coughing
and shit.

35:24.172 --> 35:25.673
Uncle bobby,
thank god!

35:26.174 --> 35:27.175
Thanks
for coming.

35:28.176 --> 35:30.678
More fuckin' stairs!

35:39.687 --> 35:41.189
You should do
yourself a favor,

35:41.189 --> 35:42.690
quit while
you're young.

35:42.690 --> 35:44.692
Gotta die for from
somethin', papi.

35:44.692 --> 35:46.694
Hey, fuck- asshole,
take the shit outta here.

35:47.195 --> 35:49.197
Alrigh
t, i'm sorry.

35:49.197 --> 35:51.199
Let me talk
to my uncle.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.701
Over here.

35:57.205 --> 35:58.706
Who's this
little spic?

35:59.207 --> 36:01.709
A guy i know,
he fucks the lady
whose house is it.

36:01.709 --> 36:03.211
I'm sorry.

36:05.213 --> 36:09.717
You know, you put that
kid in a fuckin' coma, sal.

36:09.717 --> 36:13.221
And for what, talkin'
to some puttan?

36:13.221 --> 36:16.724
I know i was wrong,
i'm sorry...

36:19.727 --> 36:22.230
he wasn't
some citizen,

36:22.230 --> 36:25.233
kid has friends.

36:25.233 --> 36:27.235
I'm sorry,
uncle bobby,

36:27.235 --> 36:29.737

tony soprano wants me to do.

36:29.737 --> 36:35.243
Take it easy,
i got you a pass.

36:35.243 --> 36:37.245
Thank you.

36:37.745 --> 36:39.747
Thank you

36:43.251 --> 36:47.255
It's good you called,
that's all i'm gonna say.

36:47.255 --> 36:50.258
Tell tony it'll never
happen again, i swear.

36:50.258 --> 36:51.259
Or if it does,

36:51.259 --> 36:53.261
i'll at least yell "fore"
next time, huh?

36:55.263 --> 36:56.764
I'm sorry.

36:56.764 --> 36:58.266
I shouldn't
make jokes.

37:00.768 --> 37:02.770
Get me a glass
of water.

37:02.770 --> 37:03.771
Yeah.

37:09.277 --> 37:10.778
You want ice?

37:10.778 --> 37:12.780
No.

37:12.780 --> 37:14.782
Let the wa
ter run, though,

37:14.782 --> 37:16.784
make s
ure it's cold.

37:16.784 --> 37:17.785
Are you alright?

37:18.286 --> 37:20.288
I'm fine.

37:29.797 --> 37:32.300
So, this guy's
still in a coma?

37:33.801 --> 37:35.303
What do you think,

37:35.303 --> 37:37.805
should i visit him o
r is that too fucked up?

37:37.805 --> 37:40.808
Yeah, i think
you should go see him.

37:43.311 --> 37:44.812
Eh, i don't know.

37:44.812 --> 37:46.314
Maybe i should
send him something.

37:46.814 --> 37:48.316
Some flowers
or some shit.

37:48.816 --> 37:50.318
Oh, what
the fuck?

38:36.364 --> 38:38.866
Eh, you fuckin'
grease ball, you!

38:38.866 --> 38:41.369
C'mon, c'mon, an
y more smart remarks?

38:41.869 --> 38:44.372
No, mr. Bacala,
please, please!

38:44.372 --> 38:45.873
No more!

38:56.384 --> 38:57.385
Mmmm....

40:12.460 --> 40:14.962
all the fuckin' luck.

40:15.463 --> 40:18.466
I told him
he shouldn't do it.

40:18.966 --> 40:19.967
Had to go all
the way

40:19.967 --> 40:22.970
to staten island
to identify him.

40:22.970 --> 40:26.474
He's a cold- hearted prick,
that nephew of mine.

40:26.474 --> 40:28.976
Cocksuckers didn't
even clean him up.

40:29.477 --> 40:32.480
He still had bits
of glass in his hair

40:32.480 --> 40:34.982
from the windshield.

40:34.982 --> 40:36.984
What was
he, 71?

40:36.984 --> 40:40.488
I don't know, 68.

40:40.488 --> 40:42.990
So, what did
they say?

40:42.990 --> 40:44.992
What was the cause
of death?

40:44.992 --> 40:46.994
Who, what do
you mean?

40:46.994 --> 40:48.996
The morgue,
the cause of death.

40:48.996 --> 40:51.499
Was it the cancer
or the accident?

40:51.499 --> 40:53.501
How advanced was
the metastasis anyway?

40:53.501 --> 40:55.503
All due respect,
junior...

40:56.003 --> 40:58.005
what do you care
about the details?

40:58.005 --> 41:00.007
All this
technical shit.

41:02.009 --> 41:03.511
You're right.

41:05.012 --> 41:07.014
The man's passed on,

41:07.014 --> 41:09.517
we should let him
rest in peace.

41:13.020 --> 41:15.022
He was a good man,
your father.

41:15.022 --> 41:17.525
A good friend.

41:18.025 --> 41:20.027
Motherfucker!

41:20.027 --> 41:23.531
Godammit,
dirty bastards!

41:28.035 --> 41:30.037
Jesus fucking christ!

41:53.060 --> 41:55.062
A customer
says goodnight,

41:55.062 --> 41:56.063
you barely
look up?

41:56.063 --> 41:59.066
I said it low.

42:03.070 --> 42:05.573
"Miss personality"
over here.

42:05.573 --> 42:07.575
What's with
the glasses?

42:09.577 --> 42:11.078
I left
my contacts home.

42:11.078 --> 42:12.079
You know,

42:12.580 --> 42:13.581
i don't know w
hat your problem is,

42:14.081 --> 42:16.083
but you've had a hair
across your ass all week.

42:21.589 --> 42:23.090
Lower your voice.

42:23.090 --> 42:24.592
What, are you
still pissed

42:24.592 --> 42:27.094
'cause i told you
you couldn't go into
business with tony?

42:27.094 --> 42:30.097
You don't tell me
fucking anything,
charmaine.

42:30.097 --> 42:31.098
For your information,

42:31.599 --> 42:32.600
i am going int
o business with tony.

42:33.100 --> 42:36.103
If you do
this, artie,

42:36.103 --> 42:38.606
if you choose
tony over me...

42:38.606 --> 42:40.608
what, what are you
gonna do, divorce me?

42:47.114 --> 42:49.617
Is that what
you want, artie?

42:49.617 --> 42:50.618
What?
What'd i say?

42:51.118 --> 42:54.622
This marriage
is over, arthur.

42:55.623 --> 42:57.124
I'm serious, artie.

42:57.625 --> 42:58.626
Good, it's about
fucking time.

42:58.626 --> 43:00.628
And you're not getting
the kids either.

43:03.631 --> 43:05.633
Son of a bitch!

43:13.641 --> 43:14.642
Hey...

43:14.642 --> 43:16.644
look who's here.

43:16.644 --> 43:18.646
He volunteered
to mow your lawn.

43:19.146 --> 43:20.147
No, i didn't.

43:20.147 --> 43:22.149
Hi, anthony.

43:22.149 --> 43:24.151
That time
of year again.

43:24.151 --> 43:25.653
I brought you the last
of my sweet corn.

43:31.659 --> 43:33.661
Well, what's
the matter,
you alright?

43:36.163 --> 43:38.165
Anthony, be
a good boy, huh?

43:38.165 --> 43:39.667
Wait outside,

43:39.667 --> 43:41.669
i need to talk
to your father.

43:49.176 --> 43:50.177
I'm telling you
right now,

43:50.678 --> 43:51.679
if this is about
old man bacala,

43:52.179 --> 43:53.681
i don't wann
a fuckin' hear it.

43:56.183 --> 43:58.185
I have cancer.

44:05.693 --> 44:07.194
You have what?

44:07.194 --> 44:10.197
Cancer...
the big casino.

44:10.197 --> 44:13.701
Jesus christ, when
'd you find this out?

44:15.703 --> 44:17.705
Blood in my stool.

44:18.205 --> 44:20.207
I had my first test
the day before

44:20.207 --> 44:22.209
your mother's funeral.

44:22.209 --> 44:24.211
That's why you been
actin' so fuckin' weird?

44:26.213 --> 44:29.216
Is it, what is it,
where is it?

44:29.216 --> 44:31.218
Is it in your
colon, or...

44:31.218 --> 44:33.220
my stomach.

44:37.725 --> 44:40.728
Jesus christ,
uncle jun'.

44:47.735 --> 44:49.737
Did they say
how bad?

44:49.737 --> 44:52.239
They won't know
'til they open me up.

44:52.239 --> 44:55.242
I go in
in two weeks.

44:55.242 --> 44:57.745
This has to stay
between us, anthony.

44:57.745 --> 44:59.747
Yeah, of course.

45:05.252 --> 45:07.254
Look, we'll
get you help,

45:07.254 --> 45:10.257
we'll get you
the best there is.

45:10.257 --> 45:11.759
First jackie
with cancer,

45:11.759 --> 45:13.260
then febby.

45:13.260 --> 45:15.763
Old man bacala had
it, but, now...

45:15.763 --> 45:18.265
you'll get me help?

45:18.265 --> 45:20.267
These things
come in threes.

45:30.277 --> 45:31.779
Is that why you didn't
want the old man

45:31.779 --> 45:34.281
to make the hit?

45:34.281 --> 45:36.784
What'd you think,
if he died of cancer,

45:36.784 --> 45:38.786
he was gonna
take your place?

45:39.286 --> 45:40.788
I asked you not
to make him do it.

45:40.788 --> 45:44.291
Ah, jesus christ,
un- fuckin'- believable.

45:44.792 --> 45:46.293
I'm serious, anthony,
what i said.

45:46.794 --> 45:49.296
Promise me that you'll
dummy up about this.

45:49.296 --> 45:52.800
Yeah, alright.

45:53.300 --> 45:54.802
You're sick, people
look at you different,

45:54.802 --> 45:56.303
they treat you like
a fuckin' non- entity.

45:56.804 --> 45:58.305
I'm not kidding.

45:58.305 --> 46:00.307
You can't talk about
this with anybody.

46:00.307 --> 46:03.310
Yeah, yeah,
of course.

46:03.310 --> 46:05.312
Of course.

46:09.817 --> 46:11.318
Hello?

46:11.318 --> 46:12.820
Uncle jun's
got cancer.

46:20.828 --> 46:23.330
A lotta death...

46:23.330 --> 46:25.332
...ma...

46:27.835 --> 46:30.838
seems like yesterday
, pop and emphysema.

46:31.338 --> 46:33.841
Uncle jun',
another toothpick.

46:34.341 --> 46:36.844
Hey, jan,
a little respect.

46:36.844 --> 46:40.347
I'm sorry, it's just
what ma used to say.

46:40.848 --> 46:43.350
Yeah, that's right.

46:43.350 --> 46:46.854
She said it about
her own brother,
remember?

46:46.854 --> 46:48.856
Another toothpick...

46:49.356 --> 46:51.859
jesus...

46:51.859 --> 46:54.862
what was he,
like 36 years old,
uncle mickey.

46:55.362 --> 46:57.364
Liver cancer.

46:59.867 --> 47:02.369
Jesus, these
old timers,

47:04.872 --> 47:07.875
i guess the more
hard- ass their attitude,

47:07.875 --> 47:11.378
the more they coul
d suppress their feelings.

47:11.378 --> 47:13.881
I think it's the
illusion of control.

47:13.881 --> 47:14.882
Control?

47:15.382 --> 47:18.886
You say the most horrible
shit you can think of

47:18.886 --> 47:20.888
in the face
of tragedy,

47:20.888 --> 47:24.892
it's like saying
to god,"see?

47:24.892 --> 47:26.894
"You don't fool
me, asshole.

47:26.894 --> 47:28.395
I know what
you're planning."

47:28.896 --> 47:31.398
Yeah, like they're try
ing to ward off some evil...

47:31.398 --> 47:33.400
or some shit.

47:33.901 --> 47:36.403
Remember how ma,
she hated compliments?

47:36.403 --> 47:38.405
Giving'em
or taking'em.

47:38.906 --> 47:42.910
'Cause then, maybe,
at any minute, boom.

47:48.916 --> 47:51.418
I've really been
coming to know christ.

47:54.922 --> 47:58.425
Ma, febby, uncle jun',

47:58.926 --> 48:00.928
always comes
in threes, huh?

48:00.928 --> 48:03.430
And, then, there's
the holy trinity.

48:03.430 --> 48:06.433
You think that's
a coincidence?

48:20.447 --> 48:22.950
What happened to
sal bonpensiero, ton'?

48:26.453 --> 48:28.956
Witness protection.

48:31.458 --> 48:32.960
Would you like
to pray with me?

49:14.001 --> 49:15.502
Two weeks ago?

49:15.502 --> 49:17.004
Why didn't you
say anything?

49:17.004 --> 49:18.005
Did you report it
at least?

49:18.505 --> 49:19.506
To who,
the rent- a- cops?

49:20.007 --> 49:21.008
Campus
security's
a joke.

49:21.008 --> 49:22.509
Well, don't you think
they should know

49:22.509 --> 49:23.510
they have a thief
preying on the school?

49:24.011 --> 49:25.012
Who?

49:25.012 --> 49:26.513
What are you
talking about?

49:26.513 --> 49:28.015
Nothing.

49:28.015 --> 49:31.018
Her bike was stolen from
outside the library
two weeks ago.

49:31.018 --> 49:33.020
The ten speed?

49:33.020 --> 49:34.521
Did yo
u lock it up?

49:34.521 --> 49:36.523
They used
bolt cutters.

49:36.523 --> 49:38.025
Some black guy
from the neighborhood.

49:38.025 --> 49:40.027
One of the other
kids saw him.

49:44.531 --> 49:46.033
What?

49:46.033 --> 49:48.035
Did i say
anything?

49:56.543 --> 49:59.046
A black guy.

49:59.046 --> 50:00.047
Imagine that.

50:00.547 --> 50:01.548
Tony...

50:01.548 --> 50:05.552
it's just, you kno
w, i can't believe it.

50:05.552 --> 50:07.054
I am not listening
to this shit.

50:07.554 --> 50:08.555
Why don't yo
u admit it?

50:08.555 --> 50:10.057
You're thinkin' exactl
y what i'm thinkin'.

50:10.057 --> 50:11.058
Tony, what
did i say?

50:11.058 --> 50:12.559
What, is it my fault

50:12.559 --> 50:14.561
you're twice as likely
to be robbed by a black?

50:15.062 --> 50:16.563
That is so
fucking racist!

50:16.563 --> 50:17.564
It happens
to be a fact.

50:17.564 --> 50:19.066
From who, david duke?

50:19.066 --> 50:21.068
Why are they talking about
this in the basement?

50:21.068 --> 50:23.070
Try the fbi,
i saw it on tv.

50:23.570 --> 50:25.072
Oh, so now you're
quoting the fbi.

50:25.572 --> 50:26.573
I don't think they're
in the basement.

50:27.074 --> 50:28.075
But, the lamp.

50:28.075 --> 50:30.077
That's right, it's
on battery back up.

50:30.077 --> 50:31.078
Why?

50:31.078 --> 50:32.579
For your
information,

50:32.579 --> 50:34.081
crime is an
economic issue,
not a racial one.

50:34.581 --> 50:36.083
White or
african- american,

50:36.083 --> 50:37.584
you're mor
e likely to steal

50:37.584 --> 50:39.086
if you're in a
lower income bracket,

50:39.086 --> 50:40.587
which most
african- americans are.

50:40.587 --> 50:42.089
Good, then you'll
feel better

50:42.089 --> 50:43.590
when the next one
takes your car stereo.

50:44.091 --> 50:45.092
You are such
a hypocrite!

50:45.592 --> 50:47.094
This is what
i been trying to
tell you all along.

50:47.094 --> 50:48.595
You stay with
your own people!

50:50.597 --> 50:51.598
Wait a second,

50:51.598 --> 50:52.599
where are you
going where that lamp?

50:52.599 --> 50:53.600
I'm taking it.

50:54.101 --> 50:55.602
The halogen nana gave me
gives me a headache.

50:55.602 --> 50:57.604
Hey, don't chang
e the goddamn subject,

50:57.604 --> 50:58.605
both of you!

50:58.605 --> 51:00.107
I'm out of here.

51:00.107 --> 51:02.109
Be sure to call me
when you need some money!

51:07.614 --> 51:09.116
Good, now you
got something

51:09.116 --> 51:11.118
you can rat me o
ut about in therapy!

51:17.624 --> 51:19.626
'Madonn,
this place!

51:20.127 --> 51:21.628
You only
retire once.

51:31.638 --> 51:33.140
Is that
an earring?

51:33.640 --> 51:34.141
Huh?

51:34.641 --> 51:36.143
Your ear, i never
noticed before.

51:36.143 --> 51:37.644
This?

51:37.644 --> 51:40.147
I've had thi
s for years.

51:40.147 --> 51:42.149
I don't wear it
all the time.

51:44.151 --> 51:47.154
Chris tell ya we had
a little run- in?

51:47.154 --> 51:49.656
He's just jealous.

51:49.656 --> 51:51.158
Of what?
We're friends.

51:51.158 --> 51:53.160
You know
how he is.

51:55.162 --> 51:57.664
I'm glad he didn't
make you cancel tonight.

51:57.664 --> 52:00.667
He don't know about tonight,
he thinks i'm with cindy.

52:05.672 --> 52:08.175
I'm gonna miss you, ade.

52:08.175 --> 52:11.178
Oh, i'm gonna
miss you too, artie.

52:11.178 --> 52:14.181
Charmaine,
the busboys.

52:15.682 --> 52:17.684
Charmaine...

52:19.186 --> 52:20.687
what's wrong?

52:20.687 --> 52:22.689
Charmaine and me
, we're gonna...

52:22.689 --> 52:25.192
try it apart
for a little while.

52:25.692 --> 52:27.194
Oh, my god, artie,
are you okay?

52:27.694 --> 52:28.195
The kids?

52:28.695 --> 52:30.197
It's f
or the best.

52:30.197 --> 52:32.199
Hey, did i tell you?

52:32.199 --> 52:33.700
I'm gonna go int
o business with tony.

52:33.700 --> 52:37.704
What, like
a restaurant?

52:37.704 --> 52:39.206
Satriale foods.

52:42.209 --> 52:45.212
Probably gonna cha
nge the name to vesuvio.

52:46.713 --> 52:50.217
Sauce, taral,
ravioli.

52:50.217 --> 52:52.219
That's great,
congratulations.

52:55.222 --> 52:56.723
You change your mi
nd about the marriage,

52:57.224 --> 52:58.725
there's always
room on my staff

52:58.725 --> 53:01.728
for a bright,
sexy, vice president.

53:07.734 --> 53:11.238
It's a big step,
marriage.

53:13.240 --> 53:14.741
You sure
you're ready?

53:14.741 --> 53:16.743
Yeah, i'm sure.

53:30.257 --> 53:32.259
You know where
the ladies room is?

53:32.759 --> 53:33.760
Yeah, i think it's,

53:34.261 --> 53:35.762
i think it's
behind the bar.

53:35.762 --> 53:36.763
Okay...

53:36.763 --> 53:38.765
no, no.

53:44.271 --> 53:46.273
The plate is hot.

53:53.280 --> 53:55.782
Restaurants,
stores,

53:55.782 --> 53:58.785
slips for
luxury yachts...

53:58.785 --> 54:01.288
we'll go with my plumbing
and electrical unions.

54:01.788 --> 54:04.791
The steel,
the brick work,
it's all yours.

54:04.791 --> 54:08.795
We need to hav
e a conversation
about local 187.

54:08.795 --> 54:10.297
You gotta come by
the office,

54:10.297 --> 54:11.798
see the scale model.

54:11.798 --> 54:13.300
The guy even made
little people

54:13.300 --> 54:14.801
walking on
the street!

54:14.801 --> 54:15.802
Fuckin' newark!

54:16.303 --> 54:18.305
They got little hooker
s giving little blow jobs.

54:21.308 --> 54:23.310
I gotta go
take a leak.

54:29.816 --> 54:33.320
So, i got a call from
eddie voehl, at the pba.

54:33.320 --> 54:34.821
Your friend,
the cop?

54:34.821 --> 54:37.324
He's bitching about
losing his overtime.

54:37.324 --> 54:39.326
He's got some
black officers' squad

54:39.326 --> 54:40.827
looking into
his case.

54:41.328 --> 54:43.330
Oh, yeah?

54:45.832 --> 54:48.335
If you want,
i can get it squashed,

54:48.335 --> 54:50.337
get him reassigned.

54:52.839 --> 54:55.842
You know what?
Fuck him.

54:56.343 --> 54:59.346
Cocksucker got
what he deserved.

55:10.357 --> 55:11.358
Yes?

55:14.861 --> 55:17.864
The tony soprano wiretap
has been neutralized.

55:20.867 --> 55:22.369
What do you mean?

55:41.888 --> 55:43.390
Hello?

55:43.890 --> 55:45.392
In here.

55:48.895 --> 55:52.399
What are you doing
, you're not ready?

55:52.399 --> 55:56.403
I'm not going.

55:56.403 --> 55:59.906
They gave yo
u permission.

55:59.906 --> 56:03.410
I can't,
i'm not up to it.

56:03.410 --> 56:06.413
It's my father's
funeral, junior.

56:06.413 --> 56:07.914
You hear me,
i don't feel up to snuff.

56:08.415 --> 56:10.917
You look okay
to me.

56:12.919 --> 56:14.421
Junior!

56:14.921 --> 56:16.923
What's the matter,

56:16.923 --> 56:18.925

the arrangement i sent?

56:18.925 --> 56:21.428
My whole family's
in the car.

56:21.428 --> 56:22.929
I gotta tell you,
junior,

56:22.929 --> 56:24.931
i take this as
a personal insult.

56:25.432 --> 56:26.433
What do you think,
i don't give a shit?

56:26.433 --> 56:27.934
What am i supposed
to think?

56:28.435 --> 56:31.438
You selfish fuck,

I have cancer.

56:37.444 --> 56:38.945
Cancer?

56:41.448 --> 56:43.950
Oh, my god.

56:43.950 --> 56:46.453
Real wisenheimer,

56:51.958 --> 56:53.960
Two weeks, i go in
for the surgery,

56:53.960 --> 56:56.463
and they'll probably start me
on the chemo after that.

56:57.964 --> 57:00.467
Junior,
i'm sorry.

57:00.467 --> 57:03.470
I don't know
what to say.

57:03.470 --> 57:04.471
Yeah, yeah,
alright.

57:04.471 --> 57:06.973
I'll say a prayer
for your old man.

boat a long time age.
