WEBVTT

01:31.291 --> 01:32.159
Hey Mom?

01:32.192 --> 01:33.327
Yeah?

01:33.360 --> 01:35.195
What sound did
the drum kit make

01:35.228 --> 01:36.664
as it fell down the metal?

01:38.231 --> 01:40.167
I have no idea.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.169
Ba-dum-tschh.

01:45.405 --> 01:46.608
You're funny.

01:46.641 --> 01:48.141
Thank you.

01:48.175 --> 01:49.376
We'll have to tell that one
to your dad.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.111
He'll like that.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.447
<i>They always win.</i>

01:53.480 --> 01:56.183
<i>They don't always win.</i>

01:56.216 --> 01:57.317
<i>Are you nervous.</i>

01:57.351 --> 02:00.622
Maybe I just thought
this year would be different.

02:00.655 --> 02:02.422
Honey.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.258
<i>Sometimes we need to do things
that scare us, you know,</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:07.294
<i>in order for us to grow.</i>

02:07.327 --> 02:08.529
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:08.830 --> 02:11.633
Anyway, those are
new skates too, so...

02:13.367 --> 02:15.369
<i>I've gotta keep
doing it.</i>

02:16.236 --> 02:18.271
That's the spirit, kid.

03:54.936 --> 03:56.303
<i>...five push-ups!</i>

04:59.499 --> 05:00.400
<i>Is she up?</i>

05:00.433 --> 05:01.002
<i>She'd better be.</i>

05:01.035 --> 05:02.103
<i>This is not a vacation.</i>

05:02.136 --> 05:03.838
She's trying, Philip.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.540
She got kicked out of school.

05:05.573 --> 05:08.576
It's not like she robbed
a bank or anything.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.112
<i>Morning Dad.</i>

05:11.145 --> 05:12.479
Morning Grace.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.714
<i>Morning, Lucy.</i>

05:15.516 --> 05:16.717
I'm running late.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.684
Follow me for one of my
favourite features of the home

05:49.717 --> 05:52.385
is this smoke marble island.

05:52.419 --> 05:53.921
I mean, do you believe it?

05:53.955 --> 05:56.423
After everything I've done
for her?

05:56.456 --> 05:58.593
Have you told her
how you feel?

05:58.626 --> 05:59.760
You think I could...

05:59.794 --> 06:02.697
just say how
I really feel?

06:02.997 --> 06:06.499
And we have two spare bedrooms
just off of the family room.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.935
I'm sorry you feel so...

06:07.969 --> 06:08.970
Empty?

06:10.805 --> 06:13.908
There's no other word
to describe it.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.643
Empty.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.813
- <i>Take care.</i>
- <i>Bye.</i>

06:38.799 --> 06:42.770
Letting someone go
is hard to do.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.673
So it wasn't easy.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.942
Six months doesn't
feel like a long time

06:47.975 --> 06:49.710
to be with someone,
you know.

06:49.744 --> 06:50.811
Well, it's long enough
to know

06:50.845 --> 06:53.748
that Eric was not a healthy
relationship for you.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.983
Yeah.

06:56.017 --> 07:01.589
Every word that I said to him,
the stronger I felt.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.224
Okay, good.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.660
And why do you think that is?

07:05.693 --> 07:07.061
Because of you.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.930
I think you're giving me
too much credit.

07:08.963 --> 07:11.766
I don't think I am,
Doctor Clark.

07:15.036 --> 07:15.970
Okay.

07:16.003 --> 07:19.006
There are things I'm probably
going to miss.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.608
Okay.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.475
<i>Tell me about that.</i>

07:23.978 --> 07:26.847
<i>How smart he is.</i>

07:26.881 --> 07:29.850
<i>Charming and intuitive.</i>

07:32.853 --> 07:34.989
But the things I won't miss,

07:35.790 --> 07:37.558
Oh, my god...

07:39.060 --> 07:42.930
<i>His rigidity, his inflexibility.</i>

07:42.964 --> 07:46.667
His constant need to just know
exactly what I was doing

07:46.701 --> 07:49.971
and to be in control
of my life.

07:50.004 --> 07:50.838
Okay, I'm sorry.

07:50.871 --> 07:51.939
It's my fault, okay?

07:51.973 --> 07:54.575
Like even being here,
seeing you,

07:54.608 --> 07:57.845
this thing that I treasure
and this...

07:57.878 --> 08:00.648
this thing that he knew
saved my life?

08:02.316 --> 08:04.552
He hates psychiatry.

08:04.585 --> 08:09.623
He said they're all charlatans
and frauds.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.825
Really?

08:10.858 --> 08:12.093
Yeah.

08:12.426 --> 08:15.563
Look, I think you should be
really proud.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.966
I mean, it's one thing
to face a hard truth

08:19.000 --> 08:21.736
and it's another
to act on it.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.537
Yeah.

08:31.345 --> 08:36.584
I was thinking about
this summer.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.120
What if we went to
British Columbia, huh?

08:39.153 --> 08:43.057
Rent that place on the lake
that we all used to love?

08:45.159 --> 08:46.927
Maybe.

08:47.128 --> 08:50.965
Yeah, a family vacation
like we used to do.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.676
Um, sorry, I'm...

09:02.710 --> 09:05.713
just have got a lot
to catch up on.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.681
Okay.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.232
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>

09:25.266 --> 09:28.102
We're joined today by the Dean
of this prestigious school,

09:28.135 --> 09:30.171
Dr. Vanessa Fanning.

09:30.204 --> 09:30.871
There she is.

09:30.905 --> 09:32.073
Give her a round of applause.

09:33.174 --> 09:34.775
Go on, Doctor Clark.

09:34.809 --> 09:35.976
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:36.010 --> 09:37.912
Um, there is a clinical case
study that I'd like to share

09:37.945 --> 09:38.879
with you all today.

09:38.913 --> 09:42.983
The patient's name,
we will call her Mary.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.987
<i>She's a 22 year-old female.</i>

09:47.021 --> 09:48.856
<i>She's one of two siblings.</i>

09:48.889 --> 09:50.958
She came from a wealthy
west coast family.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.960
<i>She and her older brother
were raised on an estate</i>

09:52.993 --> 09:54.829
<i>their paternal
grandfather built.</i>

09:54.862 --> 09:57.832
Her father struggled
with bipolar disorder,

09:57.865 --> 10:00.000
her mother struggled
with depression.

10:00.034 --> 10:04.872
<i>And when Mary was 11 years old,
her mother took her own life.</i>

10:05.272 --> 10:06.907
Beginning in her freshman year
at college,

10:06.941 --> 10:09.844
the patient made the first
of several suicide attempts.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.882
<i>When Mary began treatment
with me,</i>

10:14.915 --> 10:18.419
<i>she was on three separate
psychotropic medications.</i>

10:18.452 --> 10:22.056
<i>After spending 14 months in a
private psychiatric facility,</i>

10:22.089 --> 10:24.725
<i>it was clear that we needed
a different approach,</i>

10:24.758 --> 10:26.727
<i>and that standard therapy
was not going</i>

10:26.760 --> 10:30.164
<i>to help this young woman
get her life back on track.</i>

10:31.699 --> 10:34.235
So...

10:34.268 --> 10:37.438
I did something that
I have never done.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.641
I stepped back from my usual
methodology as her doctor.

10:41.275 --> 10:43.043
<i>And I sat in that room
with her</i>

10:43.077 --> 10:46.280
as just another troubled
human being.

10:46.313 --> 10:50.184
<i>Someone who was flawed
and frightened.</i>

10:50.217 --> 10:52.753
Someone who was regretful,

10:52.786 --> 10:56.056
<i>someone who had experienced
trauma myself.</i>

10:56.090 --> 10:58.159
<i>I told Mary my whole life story.</i>

10:58.192 --> 11:00.761
I told her things that I had
never told anyone else.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.964
I told her things that
I had never told my wife.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.704
I did this because I wanted
Mary to understand

11:10.738 --> 11:14.041
that she wasn't alone, that her
despair wasn't foreign to me.

11:14.074 --> 11:19.079
<i>I wanted to take the cap of
shame off of her experience.</i>

11:20.314 --> 11:23.784
In four months, her
symptoms disappeared.

11:23.817 --> 11:28.189
In six months, she was off
all of her medication.

11:28.222 --> 11:31.091
And after 14 months,
she's been doing so well

11:31.125 --> 11:34.028
that she's started to write
a book about her illness,

11:34.061 --> 11:36.964
and she's taking charge
of her relationships.

11:40.100 --> 11:44.238
At long last, Mary's life
is back on track.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.511
That was a great lecture
you know.

11:49.544 --> 11:51.345
Vanessa, I know
what you're thinking.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.948
Look Philip, it's... it's great
that you've had this

11:53.981 --> 11:55.517
breakthrough with your patient.

11:55.550 --> 11:58.953
It's obviously affected you
in a positive way as well.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.921
That is not what
you're thinking.

12:00.955 --> 12:02.790
Come on.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.992
Ethically, this is a grey area.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.261
Sharing such personal
information with a patient.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.395
Okay.

12:08.429 --> 12:11.232
I'm just concerned about
your well-being as well as hers,

12:11.265 --> 12:14.235
given everything your family's
been through.

12:14.268 --> 12:16.804
We're fine. We're fine.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.305
I do want to say I'd feel
more comfortable

12:18.339 --> 12:21.275
if your patient would still
continue with her meds,

12:21.308 --> 12:23.043
for the benefit of both
of you.

12:24.078 --> 12:25.879
You're so old school.

12:25.913 --> 12:26.947
Philip.

12:26.981 --> 12:28.882
You're gonna have
to trust me.

12:30.351 --> 12:31.252
All right.

12:31.285 --> 12:32.353
- Okay.
- I will.

12:32.386 --> 12:33.854
How are Lucy and Grace
doing now?

12:33.887 --> 12:34.888
- They're okay.
- Good.

12:34.922 --> 12:35.756
They're doing well.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.225
I look forward to seeing
Grace tonight...

12:38.259 --> 12:39.093
if we're still on.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.261
Tonight, yeah.

12:40.294 --> 12:40.894
If we're still on.

12:40.928 --> 12:44.164
Okay. I'll see you later.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.243
Hey Daphne.

12:56.277 --> 12:57.211
<i>Doctor Clark?</i>

12:57.244 --> 12:59.581
Yeah, what's up?

13:01.181 --> 13:03.851
She's dead.

13:03.884 --> 13:04.952
Joan.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.186
<i>My best friend, she...</i>

13:06.220 --> 13:07.221
<i>Oh, no. Daphne...</i>

13:07.254 --> 13:08.322
She's dead.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.124
Oh, my god.

13:11.892 --> 13:12.926
What happened?

13:12.960 --> 13:15.829
<i>She was jogging
in Forest Park.</i>

13:15.863 --> 13:17.331
<i>In Portland.</i>

13:17.364 --> 13:19.300
It was a hit and run.

13:19.333 --> 13:22.036
<i>Somebody hit her
with a car.</i>

13:22.069 --> 13:22.936
Okay.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.038
Okay, listen to me.

13:24.071 --> 13:24.606
<i>She was killed.</i>

13:24.639 --> 13:25.540
Daphne, listen to me.

13:25.573 --> 13:28.175
<i>Look. I know what
you're afraid of.</i>

13:28.208 --> 13:30.044
I'm not like that anymore.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.278
<i>I just needed someone
to talk to.</i>

13:31.312 --> 13:34.315
Okay, because I can be there
in one hour if you need me to.

13:34.348 --> 13:35.182
<i>I know.</i>

13:35.215 --> 13:36.618
Look, I'm coming in tomorrow,
okay?

13:36.651 --> 13:37.418
I'll see you then.

13:37.451 --> 13:38.520
<i>Okay.</i>

13:38.553 --> 13:40.220
But it's very important that you
do come in tomorrow.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.955
You can't skip, okay?

13:41.989 --> 13:43.190
And we're not going to call.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.059
I need you to come in
to the office tomorrow,

13:45.092 --> 13:46.994
<i>and we'll take all the time
that you need.</i>

13:47.027 --> 13:48.228
Thank you.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.865
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.338
...straight down the middle.

14:31.372 --> 14:32.139
Total meatball.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.907
Any other day,
Jordie crushes it.

14:33.941 --> 14:34.408
Oh, my god.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.342
He whiffs.

14:35.376 --> 14:39.146
Great big wide swing and pfft,
game over.

14:39.880 --> 14:40.347
That's good for him,
I think.

14:40.381 --> 14:41.148
Oh, the poor baby.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.149
Well, at least I was
smart enough

14:42.182 --> 14:44.385
to keep my mouth shut in
the car on the way home.

14:44.418 --> 14:46.019
And I credit you for that,
I do, hon.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.054
Because some fathers
never stop

14:47.087 --> 14:48.389
to put pressure
on their kids.

14:48.422 --> 14:49.923
I was the worst
second baseman

14:49.957 --> 14:50.891
in the history of the world.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.160
Philip used to practice
his therapeutic skills

14:53.193 --> 14:55.396
on the way home from hockey.

14:55.429 --> 14:58.999
How did you feel about the game,
Evan?

15:03.303 --> 15:04.338
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:07.509 --> 15:10.077
What's she doing home?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.546
Um...

15:11.579 --> 15:13.480
Lucy was expelled.

15:13.515 --> 15:14.348
What for?

15:15.249 --> 15:17.418
Oh, just some cocaine.

15:17.451 --> 15:20.053
Ah, classic teenage,
you know.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.222
Please, can we not talk
about that right now?

15:22.256 --> 15:25.192
You're right, let's never
get into it.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.298
Dad?

15:33.066 --> 15:34.935
It's the police.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.937
What?

15:41.241 --> 15:43.243
How can I help you?

15:44.011 --> 15:46.146
<i>She must have jumped
from up there.</i>

15:46.180 --> 15:48.449
<i>We're still looking
for a suicide note.</i>

15:51.351 --> 15:54.589
<i>UPS guy on his last run of
the day comes up the drive</i>

15:54.622 --> 15:56.223
<i>and there she is.</i>

15:58.325 --> 15:59.761
<i>Look man, I'm sorry
to drag you here,</i>

15:59.794 --> 16:02.296
<i>but her phone had you listed
as the doctor to call</i>

16:02.329 --> 16:04.231
<i>in case of emergency.</i>

16:06.099 --> 16:07.502
I understand.

16:09.571 --> 16:11.205
<i>No signs
of foul play,</i>

16:11.238 --> 16:14.141
<i>no suspicious activity
reported by the neighbours.</i>

16:14.174 --> 16:17.010
<i>No evidence to suggest
it was anything else, really.</i>

16:17.044 --> 16:18.111
<i>Hey!</i>

16:18.513 --> 16:20.414
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

16:20.447 --> 16:22.015
<i>Hey, sir!</i>

16:22.584 --> 16:23.785
Why are you here?

16:23.818 --> 16:25.252
<i>Who are you?</i>

16:25.419 --> 16:28.088
I'm James Flagg, all right?

16:28.121 --> 16:30.057
What's going on,
where's my sister?

16:30.090 --> 16:31.225
<i>There's been
an accident?</i>

16:31.258 --> 16:32.627
What? What?

16:32.660 --> 16:35.295
Can I, can I, can I...

16:35.329 --> 16:37.030
It's my sister...

16:37.064 --> 16:38.065
Let us handle this.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.099
<i>I just want to go and see her.
Is she okay?</i>

16:39.132 --> 16:40.100
<i>Is she okay?!</i>

16:40.133 --> 16:41.335
We'll take care of it!

16:43.203 --> 16:44.271
Calm down! Fuck!

16:44.304 --> 16:45.640
<i>Try to calm down.</i>

16:45.673 --> 16:48.008
- Daphne! Daph!
- Take a breath.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.545
<i>Take a breath.</i>

16:50.578 --> 16:51.345
Fucking let me go!

16:51.378 --> 16:52.145
Medic!

16:52.179 --> 16:53.146
Daphne!

16:53.180 --> 16:57.552
<i>She's my sister!
She's my sister, please!</i>

17:04.491 --> 17:06.260
Hi, I'm...
I'm Philip Clark.

17:06.293 --> 17:09.162
I was your sister's
psychiatrist.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.498
And I... I know what you must
be going through,

17:11.533 --> 17:14.201
and I'm very sorry.

17:14.234 --> 17:17.170
I think there's
a curse on this family.

17:17.539 --> 17:23.076
Nobody to rage at,
nobody to blame but us.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.546
But me.

17:27.649 --> 17:31.218
I'm the only one left now.

17:31.251 --> 17:35.355
I knew she loved Joan,
and when she called,

17:35.389 --> 17:37.424
I could hear the pain
in her voice.

17:37.457 --> 17:41.529
But... she was calm.

17:41.563 --> 17:44.298
So I... I didn't, I didn't feel
the need to rush up here

17:44.331 --> 17:45.432
that instant, you know?

17:45.465 --> 17:47.301
I, I, I, I, I...

17:51.238 --> 17:54.576
You know what I did, I let
her slip through my fingers.

17:54.609 --> 17:55.375
I just...

17:55.409 --> 17:57.512
No, no. James.
She called me too.

17:57.545 --> 18:01.214
I don't think there's anything
that could've been done.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.250
That just isn't how it works.

18:05.152 --> 18:08.155
You and me, eh?
Two strangers.

18:11.325 --> 18:13.226
In this together.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.136
Of course I'll cover
your classes, Philip.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.540
It's... it's the least
I can do.

18:25.573 --> 18:27.474
Thanks.

18:27.508 --> 18:30.645
I feel like I've lost
my balance.

18:30.678 --> 18:36.149
I'll just take a little time
and I'll get it back.

18:36.183 --> 18:39.252
Philip, I'm... I'm here for you
to support you,

18:39.286 --> 18:41.656
not to judge you,
you know that.

18:41.689 --> 18:43.156
Yes.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.058
You need to take a moment

18:44.092 --> 18:47.160
to deal with what's happened
this time.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.162
Please don't rush yourself.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.464
Okay.

18:50.865 --> 18:53.233
You know, losing a patient
is tough.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.369
It's a bereavement, Philip.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.378
Philip?

19:06.279 --> 19:07.447
Philip?

19:48.022 --> 19:49.222
Hi.

19:49.824 --> 19:51.391
Hi.

19:51.425 --> 19:55.697
Is um, is...
is Doctor Clark home?

19:55.730 --> 19:57.397
Uh... yeah.

19:57.699 --> 19:59.734
I have something for him.

19:59.767 --> 20:02.269
Oh, uh, Dad?

20:02.737 --> 20:04.237
Thank you.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.273
He's just making a call.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.509
- <i>Um.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

20:08.543 --> 20:10.578
Sorry, how... how can I
help you?

20:10.611 --> 20:13.548
We were just getting ready
to sit down and eat.

20:13.581 --> 20:15.616
Oh, I'm sorry.
Bad timing.

20:16.617 --> 20:20.822
My name is James Flagg.

20:20.855 --> 20:25.258
I'm the... I'm the brother
of his patient, who uh...

20:25.292 --> 20:27.394
I'm so sorry.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.328
It's all right.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.329
I'm going to go grab him.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.631
Thank you very much.

20:30.665 --> 20:34.367
<i>Philip? Philip?</i>

20:37.672 --> 20:38.506
Hi.

20:38.539 --> 20:39.707
Hey.

20:39.741 --> 20:42.877
I'm sorry, I looked up your
address and I drove on over.

20:42.910 --> 20:46.313
I wanted to return this,
which is yours.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.049
Or at least,
your name's inside.

20:48.082 --> 20:49.851
Been packing up the house,
you know.

20:49.884 --> 20:51.519
Sifting through boxes.

20:51.552 --> 20:53.521
I figured you'd lent it to her,
you might want it back.

20:53.554 --> 20:54.421
I did.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.723
Thank you.

20:55.757 --> 20:57.491
Sorry you had to drive it
all the way over here.

20:57.525 --> 20:58.325
No problem.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.294
It's good to get out
of the house.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.363
Anyway, I'll get back to it.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.331
Okay.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.567
James?

21:08.669 --> 21:11.338
How are you doing?

21:11.371 --> 21:12.372
Well, you know...

21:13.674 --> 21:16.476
Not great.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.446
Sorry.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.447
It's all right.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.816
Philip.

21:21.849 --> 21:25.520
I'm just wondering if James
had... had dinner yet.

21:25.553 --> 21:26.721
I don't know.

21:26.754 --> 21:28.623
Would you like to join us?

21:28.656 --> 21:30.758
He was just dropping off a book.

21:30.792 --> 21:31.592
Yeah.

21:31.626 --> 21:32.794
We've got Thai
and I ordered extra,

21:32.827 --> 21:34.829
so we'd love to have you.

21:36.831 --> 21:39.332
If you want to stay for dinner,
you're welcome to.

21:39.366 --> 21:39.767
Are you sure?

21:39.801 --> 21:41.334
Yes, please.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.369
Okay.

21:43.771 --> 21:45.773
Thank you.

21:45.807 --> 21:47.575
No trouble at all.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.346
I can only guess what
a difficult time

21:53.380 --> 21:55.783
this must be for you.

21:58.853 --> 22:00.655
How long have you been
living abroad?

22:01.722 --> 22:04.592
It's... it's a bit of a blur.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.694
I moved over to England
as a child,

22:06.727 --> 22:08.863
went to boarding school
and then,

22:08.896 --> 22:10.430
yeah, sort of stayed on.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.534
So abroad is more home to me
now than home,

22:13.568 --> 22:14.401
if you know what I mean?

22:14.434 --> 22:16.737
Mm-hmm.

22:16.771 --> 22:19.841
And you've been working
on a novel?

22:19.874 --> 22:21.676
Yes. Yep.

22:21.709 --> 22:23.376
My second stab.

22:23.410 --> 22:27.447
My first attempt was horrendous,
so...

22:27.480 --> 22:30.852
uh, yeah, I mean, a total,
I mean, a real mess.

22:30.885 --> 22:32.419
But luckily for me,
no one read it.

22:32.452 --> 22:32.920
So...

22:34.121 --> 22:39.794
Anyway, the reason I'm back here
in the States is, was...

22:39.827 --> 22:43.931
Other than seeing my sister,
is because an agent

22:43.965 --> 22:46.000
took a liking to a couple
of the chapters of the...

22:46.033 --> 22:48.603
you know, the thing
I'm working on now, and...

22:48.636 --> 22:49.737
I'm going to go meet him.

22:49.770 --> 22:50.571
Great.

22:50.605 --> 22:51.438
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:51.471 --> 22:54.441
I was four pages
into my masterpiece

22:54.474 --> 22:59.914
when I went and got that
real estate license, so...

22:59.947 --> 23:02.850
Four pages is better than
nothing, you know, so.

23:02.884 --> 23:05.186
Everyone has to start
somewhere.

23:05.219 --> 23:06.821
What about you, Lucy?

23:06.854 --> 23:09.924
Any idea what you want
to do or be, or?

23:09.957 --> 23:12.960
Yeah well, I have a lot
of thoughts.

23:12.994 --> 23:15.462
Nothing concrete though.

23:15.495 --> 23:16.429
That's okay.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.430
I get that.

23:19.233 --> 23:21.502
She's still so young, so...

23:23.971 --> 23:25.973
Um, coffee anyone?

23:26.007 --> 23:27.775
- That's a good idea.
- Mmmhmm.

23:27.808 --> 23:28.776
I'd love one.

23:28.809 --> 23:29.677
Great.

23:29.710 --> 23:30.945
Thank you.

23:34.615 --> 23:36.550
You're a lucky man.

23:37.919 --> 23:42.823
Family's all there is,
and you have a great one.

23:42.857 --> 23:45.059
Thank you.
Thank you.

23:45.092 --> 23:47.828
I'm sure they can drive you
up the wall sometimes,

23:47.862 --> 23:50.665
but take it from someone
who knows a wonderful thing

23:50.698 --> 23:52.533
when he sees it.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.875
Goodnight.

24:01.075 --> 24:02.610
<i>Bye.</i>

24:39.613 --> 24:40.681
Hello, Vanessa?

24:40.715 --> 24:41.582
<i>Hi Philip.</i>

24:41.615 --> 24:42.950
<i>Sorry if I'm interrupting.</i>

24:42.984 --> 24:44.785
Could you possibly swing by
and see me

24:44.819 --> 24:46.087
for a few minutes
this afternoon?

24:46.120 --> 24:47.121
<i>Okay sure.</i>

24:47.154 --> 24:50.124
I've got a few errands to run.
Would 3:00 work?

24:50.157 --> 24:52.126
Mm-hmm, perfect.

24:52.159 --> 24:53.027
<i>Okay.</i>

24:54.028 --> 24:54.962
See you then.

24:54.996 --> 24:57.497
Okay, bye.

25:15.016 --> 25:15.916
Uncle Phil!

25:15.950 --> 25:17.051
Hey Lilly.

25:17.084 --> 25:19.320
So great to see you.

25:19.353 --> 25:20.554
What are you doing home?

25:20.588 --> 25:21.956
Week before midterms.

25:21.989 --> 25:23.591
Figured I'd come home
to raid their fridge

25:23.624 --> 25:24.759
and get all my washing done.

25:24.792 --> 25:27.328
Oh, yeah, that's why
I'm here too.

25:27.361 --> 25:29.697
So what parent are you after,
Mom or Dad?

25:29.730 --> 25:31.032
Dad.

25:31.065 --> 25:34.935
Hey, um, they told me
about Lucy.

25:34.969 --> 25:36.070
Oh.

25:36.103 --> 25:38.572
I'm really, really sorry.

25:38.606 --> 25:41.642
Can you please tell her
she can always call me?

25:41.675 --> 25:42.843
She's like my little sister.

25:42.877 --> 25:43.878
That's very nice.

25:43.911 --> 25:45.146
So Dad is in his office.

25:45.179 --> 25:45.946
Okay.

25:45.980 --> 25:47.248
See you soon.

25:47.281 --> 25:49.150
<i>Listen Al, it's a first
edition 'Catcher in the Rye'.</i>

25:49.183 --> 25:51.118
<i>I've already got two offers.</i>

25:51.152 --> 25:53.654
I told you, look,
anything above 40,

25:53.687 --> 25:55.056
you're in with a shot.

25:55.089 --> 25:56.891
No, I'll let you know.

25:56.924 --> 25:58.125
Okay, good.

25:58.159 --> 25:59.760
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey.

25:59.794 --> 26:00.561
Sorry to barge in.

26:00.594 --> 26:01.896
No, not at all.
What do you need?

26:01.929 --> 26:02.897
I've got a favour to ask.

26:02.930 --> 26:03.864
Okay.

26:03.898 --> 26:04.432
I'm looking for a novel
called "Shadowcast."

26:04.465 --> 26:05.933
It's three years old.

26:05.966 --> 26:08.102
Couldn't find any copies
online myself.

26:08.135 --> 26:08.803
Author's name?

26:08.836 --> 26:12.807
Uh, James Flagg,
with two g.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.575
GG.

26:16.077 --> 26:16.977
Okay, here it is.

26:17.011 --> 26:18.946
Historical fiction,
privately published

26:18.979 --> 26:20.915
with a super small printing
in the UK.

26:20.948 --> 26:22.383
Shouldn't be a problem to find.

26:22.416 --> 26:23.851
When do you need it?

26:23.884 --> 26:26.187
As soon as you can get it?

26:26.220 --> 26:28.155
A week, two at the most.

26:28.189 --> 26:29.857
Okay.

26:30.724 --> 26:32.026
How are you?

26:32.726 --> 26:34.795
Really good.

26:34.829 --> 26:35.930
Really well.

26:35.963 --> 26:37.731
No, things are good.

26:51.178 --> 26:52.646
<i>Coke head.</i>

26:54.048 --> 26:55.816
<i>She's such a druggie.</i>

27:14.235 --> 27:15.136
Oh.

27:16.937 --> 27:17.838
Hi.

27:18.038 --> 27:19.073
Hi.

27:19.106 --> 27:21.942
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

27:21.976 --> 27:23.978
It's okay.

27:24.011 --> 27:26.881
I, I saw you from the pier.

27:26.914 --> 27:28.916
My family docks
their boat there.

27:33.254 --> 27:36.023
- You mind if I...
- No.

27:36.056 --> 27:37.791
Thank you.

27:43.063 --> 27:45.065
Thank you very much.

27:50.070 --> 27:51.805
Are you in a hurry?

27:55.109 --> 27:56.010
'K.

27:57.211 --> 27:58.979
Come with me.

28:03.918 --> 28:05.786
And two coffees for you.

28:05.819 --> 28:07.721
Thank you very much.

28:16.197 --> 28:17.698
It's good.

28:20.034 --> 28:21.035
What?

28:23.003 --> 28:24.838
What is it?

28:24.872 --> 28:25.839
It's nothing.

28:25.873 --> 28:29.243
I, I was just surprised
to see you walking home

28:29.276 --> 28:31.045
from school today.

28:32.947 --> 28:34.882
Why would that be surprising?

28:34.915 --> 28:36.518
I like walking.

28:36.551 --> 28:39.019
On your own, I mean.

28:39.053 --> 28:43.057
I mean, I was surprised seeing
you walk home alone.

28:43.090 --> 28:46.860
I just assumed a girl
like you would...

28:46.894 --> 28:49.029
have lots of friends.

28:50.998 --> 28:52.833
I guess.

28:54.401 --> 28:56.870
But you don't, do you?

28:57.972 --> 28:59.873
Why is that?

29:00.474 --> 29:03.344
Today was my first day
at that place.

29:03.377 --> 29:04.378
Oh.

29:04.411 --> 29:07.214
I got thrown out of boarding
school last week.

29:07.248 --> 29:08.349
Really?

29:08.382 --> 29:09.250
Why?

29:09.283 --> 29:11.385
What... what did you do?

29:13.087 --> 29:15.789
I did a line of coke
in the science lab.

29:15.823 --> 29:16.957
Wow.

29:16.991 --> 29:18.993
Yeah, that'll do it.

29:20.194 --> 29:21.128
Nice.

29:22.863 --> 29:25.032
Well I hope that blow
was worth it.

29:27.101 --> 29:28.235
Whatever.

29:30.104 --> 29:31.305
Whatever.

29:35.309 --> 29:39.146
"Daphne Flagg's blood
is on this man's hands.

29:39.179 --> 29:41.849
"His self-serving meddling
in his patient's lives

29:41.882 --> 29:44.918
"through his experimental
methods has led to her death.

29:44.952 --> 29:46.887
"And if you don't take action
against him at once

29:46.920 --> 29:52.226
"without delay, you too will
have blood on your hands."

29:52.259 --> 29:53.093
Have you ever received
a complaint

29:53.127 --> 29:55.162
or letter like this
about me before?

29:55.195 --> 29:55.996
No, of course not.

29:56.030 --> 29:58.065
Okay, then why would you
dignify it?

29:58.098 --> 30:01.235
I'm not dignifying it, Philip.
But I can't ignore it, either.

30:01.268 --> 30:02.303
Oh.

30:02.336 --> 30:04.338
I have an obligation as the head
of the department,

30:04.371 --> 30:07.308
and as your friend I have to be
very careful about what I say

30:07.341 --> 30:09.109
and don't say.

30:10.210 --> 30:11.111
Okay.

30:11.145 --> 30:14.148
Let's work through
this methodically, okay?

30:16.350 --> 30:18.018
Did you attempt to use
your sessions with her

30:18.052 --> 30:19.286
to sort out
your own issues?

30:19.320 --> 30:20.954
That's ridiculous.

30:20.988 --> 30:22.323
I referenced my own experiences

30:22.356 --> 30:24.291
to help her process
some of her loss.

30:24.325 --> 30:25.392
How so?

30:25.426 --> 30:27.995
That was the only way I could
get her to trust me.

30:28.028 --> 30:29.863
Early on there was some

30:29.897 --> 30:31.198
predictable suggestive
language and affect.

30:31.231 --> 30:32.634
How did you respond?

30:33.233 --> 30:35.269
I didn't, I ignored it.

30:35.469 --> 30:39.106
Was there any indication
of suicidality more recently?

30:39.139 --> 30:40.207
No.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.975
I don't know.

30:42.009 --> 30:45.012
Did you abruptly and cruelly
create the despair

30:45.045 --> 30:47.848
that led to her suicide?

30:49.416 --> 30:51.251
What do you think?

30:51.285 --> 30:53.087
Doesn't matter what I think.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.421
Are you kidding me?

30:56.123 --> 30:57.458
Give me a break.

31:01.995 --> 31:02.996
What?

31:05.099 --> 31:09.269
Nothing, I was just thinking
what if...

31:12.005 --> 31:13.006
Yeah?

31:16.343 --> 31:22.449
I was just wondering,
what if we were friends?

31:26.019 --> 31:27.054
Um...

31:27.087 --> 31:30.891
No secrets, no hiding.

31:36.029 --> 31:37.431
Friends.

31:49.042 --> 31:51.011
Good first day?

31:51.044 --> 31:53.213
Mm-hmm.

31:56.417 --> 31:57.484
And you?

31:57.519 --> 32:00.154
How was your day?

32:00.187 --> 32:03.023
Good.

32:03.056 --> 32:05.325
You know, the usual.

32:07.361 --> 32:09.997
Hey Philip, we're waiting
for you.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.055
You okay?

32:35.088 --> 32:37.191
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:39.359 --> 32:41.328
James, you know,
from last night.

32:41.361 --> 32:44.398
He came by an open house
this morning.

32:44.431 --> 32:47.201
I think he's going to list
his sister's house with us.

32:47.234 --> 32:48.235
Really?

32:50.170 --> 32:51.773
What, is something wrong
with that?

32:51.806 --> 32:53.073
I mean, this is my job.

32:53.106 --> 32:54.308
This is what I do
every single day.

32:54.341 --> 32:56.043
Clients come from everywhere,
Philip.

32:56.076 --> 32:57.244
Yes, I know.

32:57.277 --> 32:59.079
It's not like there's anything
inappropriate about that.

32:59.112 --> 33:00.515
I get it. I understand.
I understand that.

33:00.548 --> 33:01.415
Do you?

33:01.448 --> 33:03.618
Because you seem a little
uncomfortable.

33:03.651 --> 33:07.087
Oh, well then...

33:07.120 --> 33:09.022
I'll just have
to get over it.

33:09.056 --> 33:10.257
Yeah.

34:21.295 --> 34:22.396
Hello?

34:37.512 --> 34:40.247
So I guess what I'm saying is,
the top side of the price range

34:40.280 --> 34:44.418
that I had mentioned seems to
be only going higher and higher.

34:44.451 --> 34:46.353
That's good though, right?
That's...

34:46.386 --> 34:49.389
Yes. It's a very good thing.

34:52.660 --> 34:56.363
I appreciate all you've done,
and I apologize

34:56.396 --> 35:01.201
if I haven't shown as much
gratitude as I should.

35:01.234 --> 35:04.906
Please James, you're still
in the midst of going through

35:04.939 --> 35:07.742
a very difficult process
right now.

35:07.775 --> 35:12.479
I'm sure no one knows that
more than you.

35:14.515 --> 35:16.116
I don't...

35:17.051 --> 35:21.254
Yeah, I haven't talked about it
with anyone for a long time.

35:21.288 --> 35:22.389
You don't have to now.

35:22.422 --> 35:25.560
Please know that's not
what I was...

35:25.593 --> 35:28.630
My husband and I have
a very different way

35:28.663 --> 35:31.198
of dealing with things.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.603
We don't talk about it.

35:37.270 --> 35:38.405
<i>Can you tell me
another one?</i>

35:38.438 --> 35:40.575
Yes, absolutely.

35:40.608 --> 35:43.443
What's a flower's favourite
body part?

35:43.477 --> 35:45.513
I have no idea.

35:45.546 --> 35:47.381
The mouth, because
it has two lips.

35:49.784 --> 35:51.451
<i>You're funny.</i>

35:51.485 --> 35:53.655
<i>You'll have to tell that one
to your dad.</i>

35:53.888 --> 35:56.223
We weren't even in a rush.

35:56.256 --> 35:57.659
You have a good sense
of humour.

35:57.692 --> 35:58.593
Thanks.

35:58.626 --> 36:00.327
I get it from you.

36:01.461 --> 36:02.964
<i>That's right you do.</i>

36:02.997 --> 36:06.400
<i>We were on our
to hockey practise.</i>

36:06.433 --> 36:07.802
I was driving.

36:07.835 --> 36:09.737
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah.

36:09.771 --> 36:12.339
<i>Down Windsor Road.</i>

36:14.742 --> 36:16.410
My baby.

36:16.443 --> 36:19.346
<i>Sometimes we need to do things
that scare us,</i>

36:19.379 --> 36:21.214
<i>in order for us to grow.</i>

36:21.248 --> 36:22.416
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:22.449 --> 36:24.552
<i>Those are new skates too, so...</i>

36:24.585 --> 36:26.420
<i>I've gotta keep going.</i>

36:26.453 --> 36:28.523
<i>That's the spirit, kid.</i>

36:47.842 --> 36:50.310
It's all right.
I'm here.

36:52.312 --> 36:54.414
I'm here.

37:09.864 --> 37:11.032
<i>Hello?</i>

37:11.065 --> 37:12.600
Mrs. Ledyard,
this is Philip.

37:12.633 --> 37:13.500
How are you?

37:13.534 --> 37:14.669
<i>Fine.</i>

37:14.702 --> 37:17.572
It's 20 past 3:00 and I'm
wondering where Freddie is.

37:17.605 --> 37:19.339
<i>Freddie is not coming,
Dr. Clark.</i>

37:19.372 --> 37:21.441
Okay, is everything
all right?

37:21.475 --> 37:22.442
<i>No, it's not.</i>

37:22.476 --> 37:24.411
<i>I'm finding a new therapist
for my son.</i>

37:24.444 --> 37:25.880
May I ask why?

37:25.913 --> 37:28.883
<i>You know why, please
don't call me again.</i>

37:28.916 --> 37:31.251
Hello?

38:17.698 --> 38:18.766
Hi.

38:24.672 --> 38:26.306
I won't be long.

38:26.607 --> 38:27.340
Hang on.

38:27.374 --> 38:28.576
Hey.

38:29.409 --> 38:30.077
Where you going?

38:30.111 --> 38:30.945
Oh, I'm going to the library.

38:30.978 --> 38:32.613
It's a study group
for history class.

38:32.647 --> 38:33.380
Okay.

38:33.413 --> 38:34.282
How are you going
to get there

38:34.314 --> 38:35.950
and then how are you going
to get back?

38:35.983 --> 38:37.417
Um, this senior named Eva?

38:37.450 --> 38:38.052
She's really smart.

38:38.085 --> 38:39.754
She's just got into Yale.

38:39.787 --> 38:40.621
Bye.

38:40.655 --> 38:42.657
No, woah.
Hang on.

38:44.725 --> 38:46.727
Why are you looking at me
that way?

38:49.462 --> 38:51.364
How do you think
I'm looking at you?

38:51.398 --> 38:52.800
Like you don't trust me
or something.

38:52.834 --> 38:53.701
I'm your Dad.

38:53.734 --> 38:54.669
It's my responsibility

38:54.702 --> 38:55.937
to make sure that you're
with a safe driver.

38:55.970 --> 38:56.871
Okay, fine. Fine.

38:56.904 --> 38:58.840
Why don't you come out
and meet her then?

38:58.873 --> 39:00.842
Come out and embarrass me in
front of a car full of people.

39:00.875 --> 39:02.610
What do I care?

39:20.928 --> 39:22.495
Hey.

39:35.843 --> 39:36.711
What are we doing?

39:36.744 --> 39:38.713
Just trust me.

39:41.215 --> 39:43.918
Okay, okay.

40:18.653 --> 40:22.390
Come on, you had to feel it
the night you came over.

40:22.757 --> 40:23.925
What?

40:23.958 --> 40:25.860
The tension.

40:25.893 --> 40:28.829
It's like my family's signature.

40:28.863 --> 40:30.731
Tension's our middle name.

40:30.765 --> 40:36.871
Why though, why, why
is there tension there?

40:36.904 --> 40:39.674
No hiding, right?

40:39.707 --> 40:41.008
Right.

40:43.911 --> 40:46.914
I had a half-brother.

40:46.948 --> 40:51.686
He died in a car crash
three years ago.

40:51.719 --> 40:53.254
My dad and my stepmother,

40:53.287 --> 40:58.491
they loved being with each
other and now it's...

40:58.526 --> 41:00.528
Now, let me guess.

41:00.561 --> 41:05.099
Now they both pulled away,
each into a private corner.

41:05.132 --> 41:08.035
Their separate world.

41:08.069 --> 41:10.871
No place for you,
am I right?

41:12.139 --> 41:13.074
Especially your dad,

41:13.107 --> 41:18.112
at a time when you had never
needed him more.

41:18.145 --> 41:24.719
So a girl who never caused
a bit of trouble

41:24.752 --> 41:27.888
suddenly began to find
it everywhere.

41:27.922 --> 41:31.025
Drops old friends,
ditches school,

41:31.058 --> 41:33.928
probably even tries
a bit of shoplifting.

41:36.998 --> 41:38.666
Yeah?

41:42.036 --> 41:43.838
Who told you that?

41:44.772 --> 41:46.507
You did.

41:49.043 --> 41:51.679
It's written all over you.

42:15.803 --> 42:16.771
Hello?

42:16.804 --> 42:18.572
<i>Hi Philip, uh, listen.</i>

42:18.606 --> 42:21.909
I... I received a new letter.

42:21.942 --> 42:23.044
Jesus Christ.

42:23.077 --> 42:24.645
Whoever it is,
they are threatening

42:24.678 --> 42:26.347
<i>to go to the State Board.</i>

42:26.380 --> 42:27.982
What the hell is going
on here?

42:28.015 --> 42:29.650
<i>I had three no shows today.</i>

42:29.683 --> 42:30.785
<i>No calls, nothing.</i>

42:30.818 --> 42:33.654
That doesn't happen in a month,
let alone an afternoon.

42:33.687 --> 42:36.357
<i>Is there a fight you're having
with someone?</i>

42:36.390 --> 42:38.926
<i>Some professional jealousy?</i>

42:38.959 --> 42:41.729
<i>A student, someone
with a grudge?</i>

42:42.830 --> 42:43.898
<i>Philip?</i>

42:43.931 --> 42:45.933
<i>You still there?</i>

42:45.966 --> 42:48.669
Yeah no, I can't think
of anybody.

42:49.370 --> 42:50.938
<i>It's put me and the department</i>

42:50.971 --> 42:54.742
<i>in a very difficult position,
Philip.</i>

42:54.775 --> 42:58.112
I don't know how much longer
I can contain this.

42:59.713 --> 43:01.682
I understand.

43:01.715 --> 43:02.650
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

43:02.683 --> 43:03.684
Ok.

43:45.025 --> 43:46.026
<i>James.</i>

43:46.060 --> 43:46.927
Grace.

43:46.961 --> 43:48.729
This is a surprise.

43:48.762 --> 43:49.997
Sorry, I was just driving past.

43:50.030 --> 43:53.000
I saw your sign.

43:53.033 --> 43:58.172
So, Daphne's house,
I need to find an agent.

43:58.205 --> 44:01.175
<i>I can help you with that.</i>

44:03.811 --> 44:06.814
Let me write down
my number.

44:08.249 --> 44:12.019
And anything you need,
house or otherwise.

44:16.190 --> 44:16.891
How much longer you going
to live like this, Grace?

44:31.138 --> 44:32.773
How much longer you going
to live like this, Grace?

44:32.806 --> 44:34.074
<i>Hey.</i>

44:36.310 --> 44:38.746
Lucy's back.

44:38.779 --> 44:40.080
Good.

44:40.114 --> 44:43.117
I was starting to get worried.

44:43.150 --> 44:45.953
How are you doing?

44:45.986 --> 44:51.192
It's been a while since you
asked me a question like that.

44:51.225 --> 44:55.029
Well I'm asking,
how are you doing?

44:56.764 --> 44:57.932
I'm good.

45:00.834 --> 45:02.703
Work? Work's all right?

45:03.904 --> 45:06.340
How's James? Any offers
on the house yet?

45:06.373 --> 45:09.176
What is it with you?

45:09.210 --> 45:10.512
What do you mean?

45:10.545 --> 45:13.247
What is it with you
and that man?

45:15.983 --> 45:17.117
He came around once

45:17.151 --> 45:19.753
and I made the huge mistake
of mentioning that to you,

45:19.787 --> 45:22.957
and now that's all you fucking
want to talk about.

45:22.990 --> 45:23.757
Not so.

45:23.791 --> 45:27.127
And no, I haven't
seen him again.

46:18.212 --> 46:19.880
Hello?

46:19.913 --> 46:21.282
James?

46:21.315 --> 46:24.051
<i>Yeah, yeah,
come in.</i>

46:31.091 --> 46:32.960
Hi Doc.

46:32.993 --> 46:35.929
Just sorting through so.

46:35.963 --> 46:37.331
You okay?

46:37.364 --> 46:43.837
Listen, I'd like you to find
a new real estate agent.

46:43.871 --> 46:44.938
Uh...

46:44.972 --> 46:46.173
Why?

46:46.206 --> 46:48.409
Well, Daphne was my patient
and there need to be boundaries.

46:48.442 --> 46:49.644
It gets too complicated.

46:49.678 --> 46:52.614
I just thought because Grace
was in the business, um, I...

46:52.647 --> 46:54.415
James.

46:54.448 --> 46:57.284
I'm asking you to find
a new realtor.

47:01.088 --> 47:05.025
I don't think I'm going
to be selling now, anyway.

47:05.059 --> 47:06.160
Not yet.

47:06.193 --> 47:08.862
I've been meaning to call Grace,
um...

47:08.896 --> 47:09.930
All right.

47:09.963 --> 47:12.132
Well then, there's no issue.

47:12.166 --> 47:13.233
Okay.

47:14.435 --> 47:15.502
Um, listen.

47:15.537 --> 47:20.908
Whilst you're here,
could I ask you for a favour?

47:20.941 --> 47:21.776
What?

47:21.810 --> 47:24.478
Could you give me a hand
with the couch?

47:24.512 --> 47:26.413
I'm sorry, I've,
I've got to go.

47:26.447 --> 47:28.315
It's a bit awkward
to carry on my own.

47:28.349 --> 47:30.284
I just want to...

47:30.652 --> 47:33.387
it would be a big help.

47:35.055 --> 47:36.156
Thanks.

47:38.359 --> 47:40.227
Thank you.

47:40.260 --> 47:44.865
Okay, I'll walk it round
one second.

47:47.267 --> 47:48.936
Just put it down there.

47:51.004 --> 47:53.207
Do you know what, actually?

47:53.240 --> 47:55.909
Can I try at the back
of the rug?

47:59.413 --> 48:00.481
Thank you.

48:04.118 --> 48:06.420
Uh, listen. I just
have to say...

48:08.556 --> 48:11.892
The deepest hurt
I've ever felt.

48:13.293 --> 48:15.462
That was something Daphne
used to say.

48:15.496 --> 48:20.234
The deepest hurt
I've ever felt

48:20.267 --> 48:27.408
was when I tried to do good
and was shamed for it.

48:27.441 --> 48:30.277
I'm not your enemy,
Doctor Clark.

48:34.549 --> 48:36.450
I never said you were.

48:36.483 --> 48:38.485
You didn't have to.

48:47.595 --> 48:51.098
The brother, then?

48:51.131 --> 48:53.967
He's the only person I can think
of who would want to hurt me.

48:54.001 --> 48:55.202
Because he blames you
for her death.

48:55.235 --> 48:56.203
Yes.

48:56.236 --> 48:58.305
However irrationally,
but when you consider

48:58.338 --> 49:00.307
the history of psychosis
in his family,

49:00.340 --> 49:02.309
is it that hard to believe?

49:02.342 --> 49:04.211
Just why?

49:04.244 --> 49:07.047
Why would he bring up Daphne
to you like this?

49:07.080 --> 49:09.016
The deepest hurt.

49:09.049 --> 49:09.818
It's meaningless.

49:09.851 --> 49:11.318
He said that to your face,
right?

49:11.351 --> 49:12.186
Yes.

49:12.219 --> 49:14.254
If this man is clinically
psychotic,

49:14.288 --> 49:16.290
he wouldn't mess around
with misdirection.

49:16.323 --> 49:18.091
He'd go straight
for the jugular,

49:18.125 --> 49:19.326
hit his target
close to home.

49:19.359 --> 49:22.396
In his kitchen, where he lives
and breathes.

49:22.429 --> 49:25.232
Well, I'm not so sure
that he isn't.

49:35.242 --> 49:37.144
Sorry I'm late.

49:37.177 --> 49:39.413
Oh, my stepmom.

49:39.446 --> 49:41.482
How is she?

49:41.516 --> 49:43.585
She's on some weird trip,

49:43.618 --> 49:46.019
and my dad needs to see
a shrink himself.

49:47.254 --> 49:49.156
Trust me, you don't know her.

49:49.189 --> 49:51.458
I mean, you only met her
once, so.

49:53.060 --> 49:56.497
This is very strange behaviour
from her.

49:59.534 --> 50:01.301
Anyway, um...

50:01.335 --> 50:03.437
So where to tonight?

50:48.148 --> 50:48.683
Do you want a beer?

50:48.716 --> 50:49.249
Yeah.

50:49.283 --> 50:53.287
All right. Don't move.

50:57.525 --> 50:58.492
How are you?

50:58.526 --> 51:00.227
Good to see you.

51:00.260 --> 51:01.428
Do you know Vanessa?

51:25.620 --> 51:28.388
James! James!

51:29.356 --> 51:31.224
Come here.

51:31.726 --> 51:34.227
They're friends,
friends of my family.

51:34.261 --> 51:35.128
What?

51:35.162 --> 51:37.665
Friends of my family,
we should leave.

51:38.666 --> 51:40.568
Okay.

51:45.405 --> 51:46.708
<i>Look at him.</i>

51:46.741 --> 51:48.743
<i>He looks so sad.</i>

51:48.776 --> 51:50.511
<i>He doesn't look sad.</i>

51:50.545 --> 51:52.412
It's the weirdest
little bunny.

51:52.446 --> 51:53.313
No, it's not.

51:54.481 --> 51:56.350
It needed saving.

51:56.383 --> 51:58.251
So, you know,
you're welcome.

52:01.321 --> 52:03.925
Thank you, though.

52:03.958 --> 52:06.259
For everything.

52:07.528 --> 52:09.162
All right.

52:13.668 --> 52:19.172
So, um, when you're done
with your sister's house,

52:19.206 --> 52:21.743
then what?

52:21.776 --> 52:23.711
I don't know.

52:26.446 --> 52:28.248
You'll be leaving, right?

52:30.283 --> 52:31.619
Yeah.

52:35.590 --> 52:38.158
Take me with you.

52:45.298 --> 52:46.299
Really?

52:48.703 --> 52:50.437
Yeah.

53:37.752 --> 53:40.755
Honey, about this summer.

53:40.788 --> 53:45.560
If you still want to go
to British Columbia,

53:45.593 --> 53:47.562
that sounds nice.

53:53.534 --> 54:03.310
We could also think about Europe
or South America.

54:03.343 --> 54:05.312
Remember Europe?

54:09.517 --> 54:13.521
Is that how you think
this works?

54:13.554 --> 54:18.760
That after all this time
it's your decision to make?

54:23.831 --> 54:26.534
It's not up to you.

54:52.425 --> 54:53.426
Hey Vanessa, it's me.

54:53.460 --> 54:56.396
I'm going to have to reschedule
our lunch today.

54:56.429 --> 54:57.632
I hope that's okay.

54:57.665 --> 54:59.600
Sorry, bye.

55:51.752 --> 55:53.554
Hello there.

55:55.890 --> 55:58.960
<i>Thank you so much for meeting me
at such late notice...</i>

55:59.827 --> 56:02.563
<i>Okay, so this is it.</i>

56:02.597 --> 56:04.599
And it's got a pool
in the back, so...

57:10.698 --> 57:13.601
Look, I just came to tell you

57:13.634 --> 57:18.906
that what happened
the other day was...

57:18.940 --> 57:22.076
Yeah.

57:22.109 --> 57:25.746
You understand?

57:25.780 --> 57:27.515
Yeah.

57:27.548 --> 57:28.849
I can't.

59:38.979 --> 59:40.014
I am...

59:41.916 --> 59:43.717
I need to go.

1:00:16.083 --> 1:00:17.918
<i>Washington Board of Psychiatry.</i>

1:00:17.952 --> 1:00:19.687
Hello?

1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:20.855
<i>I'd like to make
a formal complaint</i>

1:00:20.888 --> 1:00:22.990
<i>against one of
your psychiatrists.</i>

1:00:23.023 --> 1:00:25.159
<i>Okay, would you mind
holding please.</i>

1:00:25.192 --> 1:00:27.061
<i>Yes, I'll hold.</i>

1:00:27.928 --> 1:00:31.265
<i>It's extremely difficult
for all of us within the department,</i>

1:00:31.298 --> 1:00:34.768
and you can't tell us who's
making these accusations?

1:00:34.802 --> 1:00:36.270
<i>I'm sorry, Doctor Fanning.</i>

1:00:36.303 --> 1:00:38.772
<i>But the Board's decision
is unanimous.</i>

1:00:38.806 --> 1:00:40.908
I'll speak to Philip
personally.

1:00:40.941 --> 1:00:42.276
<i>We're very sorry.</i>

1:00:42.309 --> 1:00:44.078
Thank you.

1:01:44.673 --> 1:01:46.340
<i>Philip, new semester Monday,</i>

1:01:46.373 --> 1:01:49.143
and I know you'd had plans
to resume your class load.

1:01:49.176 --> 1:01:54.048
But that's not possible now.

1:01:54.081 --> 1:01:56.884
The administration board
wants you to step aside

1:01:56.917 --> 1:02:02.957
until this issue with your
patient is fully investigated.

1:02:02.990 --> 1:02:05.326
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1:02:07.094 --> 1:02:09.830
I've received a summons
from Olympia.

1:02:09.863 --> 1:02:11.232
This is threatening
to revoke your license

1:02:11.265 --> 1:02:14.902
pending an appearance
before the State Board.

1:02:14.935 --> 1:02:17.104
Do you think that James
is behind this?

1:02:18.172 --> 1:02:20.007
I don't care.

1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:21.775
I don't know,
I don't care.

1:02:21.809 --> 1:02:22.977
You need to do something.

1:02:23.010 --> 1:02:24.778
Find some proof, Philip.

1:02:24.812 --> 1:02:27.081
You have to defend yourself.

1:02:50.237 --> 1:02:52.072
Jump in.

1:03:49.496 --> 1:03:51.231
<i>Where to?</i>

1:03:52.232 --> 1:03:53.233
Fiji?

1:03:55.002 --> 1:03:56.070
Rio?

1:03:56.103 --> 1:03:57.338
Rome?

1:03:57.371 --> 1:03:59.139
Anywhere but here.

1:04:10.451 --> 1:04:12.152
You cold?

1:04:12.186 --> 1:04:14.021
A little.

1:04:21.362 --> 1:04:22.930
A gentleman?

1:04:24.098 --> 1:04:24.965
Beer?

1:04:24.998 --> 1:04:26.967
Yeah.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:28.435
Give me one sec.

1:04:58.031 --> 1:04:58.999
<i>Lucy?</i>

1:04:59.366 --> 1:05:01.068
Lucy!

1:05:03.303 --> 1:05:04.271
Shit!

1:05:04.304 --> 1:05:05.406
Lucy!

1:05:06.173 --> 1:05:07.341
Lucy!

1:05:10.310 --> 1:05:11.278
Lucy!

1:05:11.311 --> 1:05:13.548
Hey, hey!

1:05:13.581 --> 1:05:14.314
Lucy!

1:05:14.348 --> 1:05:15.315
Get away from me!

1:05:15.349 --> 1:05:16.950
What's gotten into you?

1:05:16.984 --> 1:05:18.485
What are you,
spying for them?

1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:20.087
You fucking informant?

1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:21.422
What are you talking about?

1:05:21.455 --> 1:05:22.289
You lied to me!

1:05:22.322 --> 1:05:23.390
You're crazy.

1:05:23.424 --> 1:05:24.324
No, I'm not crazy!

1:05:24.358 --> 1:05:26.160
You told me you didn't know
my stepmother!

1:05:26.193 --> 1:05:27.060
I don't know your stepmother!

1:05:27.094 --> 1:05:29.930
Then why the fuck
is she calling you?

1:05:33.601 --> 1:05:37.438
I'll tell you, alright?

1:05:37.471 --> 1:05:40.474
We bumped into each other
in town.

1:05:40.508 --> 1:05:43.578
We said hello.

1:05:43.611 --> 1:05:49.116
I asked her if she knew a good
appraiser for my sister's house.

1:05:49.149 --> 1:05:50.083
All right? She said she did.

1:05:50.117 --> 1:05:52.085
She said she'd call me later
with his number.

1:05:52.119 --> 1:05:53.420
And I mean, that's exactly
what she did.

1:05:53.454 --> 1:05:56.023
That's all she did,
that's it.

1:05:59.561 --> 1:06:01.094
Take it.

1:06:01.629 --> 1:06:03.330
Listen to the message.

1:06:06.033 --> 1:06:07.968
Honestly, if you don't
believe me.

1:06:10.572 --> 1:06:12.105
Go on.

1:06:12.139 --> 1:06:13.541
Take it.

1:06:15.643 --> 1:06:18.145
I said take it.

1:06:45.405 --> 1:06:50.043
Go home, pack your bags.
I'll pick you up later.

1:06:50.077 --> 1:06:52.312
We're leaving tonight.

1:08:15.495 --> 1:08:17.364
Thank you.

1:08:17.832 --> 1:08:23.538
I um, I've got something
that I wanted to say to you.

1:08:29.376 --> 1:08:35.182
For many years, I very carefully
worked through the stages,

1:08:35.215 --> 1:08:37.719
processing...

1:08:39.654 --> 1:08:42.155
Evan's death and...

1:08:44.191 --> 1:08:46.594
I thought I'd done a pretty
good job of it.

1:08:46.628 --> 1:08:49.329
But I hadn't.

1:08:49.363 --> 1:08:54.368
What I had done was develop
a coping mechanism.

1:08:54.401 --> 1:08:58.238
And...

1:08:58.271 --> 1:09:05.947
that was to, um,
to blame you.

1:09:05.980 --> 1:09:10.250
For no reason other than,
I think I just wanted

1:09:10.283 --> 1:09:17.391
everybody else to be as empty
and broken inside as I was.

1:09:17.424 --> 1:09:21.529
You sure didn't deserve it,
because you gave him life,

1:09:21.562 --> 1:09:24.398
and you loved him,
and you took care of him.

1:09:24.431 --> 1:09:27.267
And he loved you more
than anybody else.

1:09:27.300 --> 1:09:29.269
And it certainly
wasn't your fault.

1:09:35.242 --> 1:09:38.680
There's nothing I could do
but pray that you forgive me.

1:09:38.713 --> 1:09:42.315
Philip
something happened today.

1:09:45.318 --> 1:09:46.319
It's okay.

1:09:46.353 --> 1:09:47.822
No, it's not.

1:09:47.855 --> 1:09:50.758
I have to tell you.

1:09:50.792 --> 1:09:52.292
You don't have
to tell me.

1:09:52.325 --> 1:09:54.428
No. Listen to me. Philip.

1:09:54.461 --> 1:09:55.228
Please.

1:09:55.262 --> 1:09:57.665
I don't want you to have
to say it.

1:09:57.699 --> 1:09:58.566
It's okay.

1:09:58.599 --> 1:09:59.600
It's not your fault.

1:09:59.634 --> 1:10:03.403
I put you in that car,
I drove you to his house.

1:10:03.437 --> 1:10:04.337
I put you in his arms.

1:10:04.371 --> 1:10:08.275
I left you all alone
for all those years,

1:10:08.308 --> 1:10:12.312
and it's my responsibility
and it's my fault.

1:10:27.662 --> 1:10:29.496
Philip, I'm sorry.

1:11:18.813 --> 1:11:21.716
<i>Hi, this is James Flagg.
Please leave a message.</i>

1:11:21.749 --> 1:11:23.851
Um, hey James.

1:11:23.885 --> 1:11:26.087
Uh, I'm ready when you are.

1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:30.591
Uh... Yeah, so just, I'll see
you when you get here.

1:11:48.810 --> 1:11:51.712
<i>Hi, this is James Flagg.
Please leave a message.</i>

1:11:52.580 --> 1:11:55.683
<i>Hi, this is James Flagg.
Please leave a message.</i>

1:11:55.716 --> 1:11:56.784
<i>Hi, this is James Flagg.</i>

1:11:57.118 --> 1:11:58.719
<i>Hi, this is James Flagg.</i>

1:11:58.753 --> 1:11:59.620
<i>...message.</i>

1:11:59.654 --> 1:12:02.422
<i>Hi, this is James Flagg.</i>

1:12:02.455 --> 1:12:04.592
<i>...message.</i>

1:12:04.625 --> 1:12:06.861
<i>...message.</i>

1:12:06.894 --> 1:12:08.395
<i>Hi, this is James Flagg.</i>

1:12:08.428 --> 1:12:10.598
<i>...message.</i>

1:12:59.046 --> 1:12:59.947
Hi.

1:12:59.981 --> 1:13:01.549
Hey.

1:13:11.692 --> 1:13:12.793
Want some coffee?

1:13:12.827 --> 1:13:14.729
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1:13:28.075 --> 1:13:34.815
You know, I call and I call, and
you just don't answer anymore.

1:13:39.553 --> 1:13:41.522
Why are you doing this to me?

1:14:30.604 --> 1:14:31.973
Shit.

1:14:32.006 --> 1:14:34.075
You gotta be kidding me.

1:14:55.896 --> 1:14:57.098
Trouble?

1:15:02.770 --> 1:15:04.705
Yeah.

1:15:04.739 --> 1:15:06.707
I could take a look.

1:15:06.741 --> 1:15:08.642
Oh, no it's...

1:15:08.676 --> 1:15:09.777
It's okay.

1:15:09.810 --> 1:15:11.812
Look, I... I understand if you
want me to keep walking,

1:15:11.846 --> 1:15:12.813
it's fine.

1:15:12.847 --> 1:15:14.615
Honest.

1:15:19.020 --> 1:15:21.022
Have a look.

1:15:21.055 --> 1:15:22.590
Okay.

1:15:31.632 --> 1:15:32.800
- One sec.
- Sure.

1:15:45.379 --> 1:15:46.147
Hi, Triple A?

1:15:46.180 --> 1:15:50.551
Yeah. I'm just
on the corner of...

1:15:58.893 --> 1:16:00.828
They're saying 45 minutes
to an hour.

1:16:00.861 --> 1:16:02.596
Thank you so much.

1:16:02.630 --> 1:16:04.965
Can I... can I take you
somewhere in the meantime, or?

1:16:04.999 --> 1:16:07.034
- No, I'm...
- No?

1:16:07.068 --> 1:16:07.802
I'm good.

1:16:07.835 --> 1:16:09.036
Okay.

1:16:11.705 --> 1:16:15.810
I was just, uh, hoping to get to
the pharmacy before it closes.

1:16:15.843 --> 1:16:19.880
You know, pick up a prescription
for Lucy, but...

1:16:19.914 --> 1:16:21.015
Let's... let's go.

1:16:21.048 --> 1:16:23.884
I'm just literally parked there.

1:16:25.753 --> 1:16:26.687
Oh.

1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:28.155
I'll have you there and back
in two seconds.

1:16:28.189 --> 1:16:29.223
Your car will be fine.

1:16:31.192 --> 1:16:35.963
Um, I don't...
I don't bite.

1:16:35.996 --> 1:16:37.731
Uh...

1:16:37.765 --> 1:16:38.199
<i>It's up to you.</i>

1:16:38.232 --> 1:16:39.133
Okay.

1:16:40.034 --> 1:16:40.768
Okay.

1:16:40.801 --> 1:16:41.268
Yeah?

1:16:41.302 --> 1:16:41.836
<i>Just real quick.</i>

1:16:41.869 --> 1:16:42.269
Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:16:42.303 --> 1:16:44.138
Okay. Hold on.

1:16:50.144 --> 1:16:51.045
Thank you.

1:16:51.078 --> 1:16:53.614
It's okay, honestly.

1:17:04.158 --> 1:17:06.694
I'm sorry, it's broken.

1:17:08.295 --> 1:17:11.632
Um... Oh.

1:17:12.766 --> 1:17:14.802
We're not going very far, so...

1:17:20.241 --> 1:17:22.743
Oh, you turn here.
Make a right.

1:17:22.776 --> 1:17:27.047
This um, we were supposed
to turn back there.

1:17:43.797 --> 1:17:46.133
Do you want me
to answer it?

1:17:58.846 --> 1:17:59.880
Hey.

1:17:59.914 --> 1:18:01.282
<i>Hey. It's me.</i>

1:18:01.315 --> 1:18:02.917
I'm wondering if you wanted
to grab a bite

1:18:02.950 --> 1:18:04.251
and see a movie tonight.

1:18:04.285 --> 1:18:05.486
Mm-hmm.

1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:08.923
<i>Grace, you okay?</i>

1:18:08.956 --> 1:18:10.691
Grace?

1:18:14.962 --> 1:18:16.897
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

1:18:22.537 --> 1:18:23.837
Oh god.

1:18:23.971 --> 1:18:25.272
Grace, where are you?

1:18:27.542 --> 1:18:30.077
Stop the car, please.

1:18:30.110 --> 1:18:31.912
I said stop the car!

1:18:31.946 --> 1:18:32.947
I don't...

1:18:32.980 --> 1:18:34.148
<i>Grace?</i>

1:18:35.816 --> 1:18:38.118
I said stop the car,
I want to get out!

1:18:47.127 --> 1:18:48.062
Grace!

1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:09.083
Grace, stay
where you are.

1:19:12.886 --> 1:19:14.989
<i>Grace, can you hear me?</i>

1:19:15.022 --> 1:19:17.024
<i>Grace!</i>

1:19:18.025 --> 1:19:20.995
<i>Grace! Grace!</i>

1:19:21.028 --> 1:19:22.997
Say something.

1:19:23.030 --> 1:19:24.898
Hey, Doc.

1:19:28.402 --> 1:19:32.773
The deepest hurt
you've ever felt.

1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:34.908
Windsor Road.

1:20:25.392 --> 1:20:28.295
Wakey-wakey, here we are.

1:20:31.298 --> 1:20:33.067
Windsor Road.

1:21:23.117 --> 1:21:24.017
No!

1:21:26.420 --> 1:21:27.287
No!

1:21:27.722 --> 1:21:32.059
No! No!

1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:48.008
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Please, please!

1:21:48.041 --> 1:21:49.042
Hey!

1:21:50.110 --> 1:21:53.247
What the hell are you doing,
get off!

1:21:54.348 --> 1:21:56.016
Get off him!

1:22:28.783 --> 1:22:30.150
Hello, Vanessa?

1:22:30.184 --> 1:22:31.185
<i>I spoke to Grace.</i>

1:22:31.218 --> 1:22:33.153
<i>She told me what happened.</i>

1:22:33.187 --> 1:22:34.421
<i>My god, Philip.</i>

1:22:34.455 --> 1:22:37.324
<i>I know. It's okay.
It's over with now.</i>

1:22:37.357 --> 1:22:40.227
<i>You have to call the police.
There must be witnesses.</i>

1:22:40.260 --> 1:22:42.296
Grace's account
of what happened.

1:22:42.329 --> 1:22:43.430
<i>I've already called them.</i>

1:22:43.464 --> 1:22:47.501
<i>They say that she got
into his car voluntarily.</i>

1:22:47.535 --> 1:22:50.003
<i>All they can charge him
with is reckless endangerment.</i>

1:22:50.037 --> 1:22:52.507
<i>I don't think they're going
to mount a man hunt for that.</i>

1:22:53.106 --> 1:22:55.510
<i>Have you warned Lucy
about him?</i>

1:22:55.543 --> 1:22:57.044
<i>We'll talk to her
tomorrow morning.</i>

1:22:57.077 --> 1:22:59.781
<i>She's been locked
in her room all day.</i>

1:22:59.814 --> 1:23:02.517
<i>Surely the police have grounds
to arrest him,</i>

1:23:02.550 --> 1:23:05.219
<i>or at least get a restraining
order.</i>

1:23:05.252 --> 1:23:07.054
<i>They can't find him, Vanessa.</i>

1:23:07.087 --> 1:23:10.491
<i>They've checked Daphne's house,
he's gone.</i>

1:23:10.525 --> 1:23:12.326
<i>He's gone.</i>

1:23:29.677 --> 1:23:31.411
Lucy?

1:23:39.286 --> 1:23:41.054
<i>You okay?</i>

1:23:41.088 --> 1:23:43.123
I'll be fine. Okay.

1:23:43.156 --> 1:23:47.194
Look. I need to talk to you
about something.

1:23:47.227 --> 1:23:51.833
Do you remember that man that
came to dinner, James Flagg?

1:23:51.866 --> 1:23:58.171
He's a very sick
and dangerous man.

1:23:58.205 --> 1:23:59.206
So if you see...

1:23:59.239 --> 1:24:01.441
Why would I see him,
Grace?

1:24:01.475 --> 1:24:02.844
I mean, it's two
different worlds.

1:24:02.877 --> 1:24:04.444
I don't know why our paths
would cross.

1:24:04.478 --> 1:24:06.146
I don't even know why
you're asking me this.

1:24:06.179 --> 1:24:06.948
It's just...

1:24:06.981 --> 1:24:09.149
What's going on with you,
Lucy?

1:24:10.217 --> 1:24:12.554
Is everything okay with you?

1:24:13.621 --> 1:24:15.055
Yeah.

1:24:16.456 --> 1:24:18.425
Lucy, you know I'm here
for you.

1:24:18.458 --> 1:24:21.563
You can talk to me about
anything, you know that.

1:24:21.596 --> 1:24:23.463
I don't want to talk
right now.

1:24:23.497 --> 1:24:24.097
Hey.

1:24:24.131 --> 1:24:27.200
I, no... Please, just go.

1:24:56.263 --> 1:24:57.230
<i>Hey, Lucy?</i>

1:24:58.700 --> 1:24:59.232
What the...

1:24:59.266 --> 1:25:00.400
What is wrong with you?

1:25:00.434 --> 1:25:01.335
Your door is locked.

1:25:01.368 --> 1:25:02.336
Yeah?

1:25:02.369 --> 1:25:03.303
Well, you're not supposed
to lock your door

1:25:03.337 --> 1:25:05.205
if you're not going to answer
me, all right?

1:25:05.238 --> 1:25:06.206
I can lock my door.

1:25:06.239 --> 1:25:07.374
Well I don't know if you're
okay in there...

1:25:07.407 --> 1:25:07.942
I'm okay!

1:25:07.976 --> 1:25:09.209
You don't say anything.

1:25:09.242 --> 1:25:10.143
I don't know if you're okay.

1:25:10.177 --> 1:25:11.378
I am fine.

1:25:11.411 --> 1:25:13.146
There's a lot going on. I wanted
to talk to you for a minute.

1:25:13.180 --> 1:25:14.916
James Flagg is extremely
dangerous, and...

1:25:14.949 --> 1:25:17.250
No, I'm not in the mood
to be analyzed by you!

1:25:17.284 --> 1:25:19.419
I'm not a fucking
patient, okay?

1:25:19.453 --> 1:25:21.355
Hey, hey, hey! I want to come in
and talk to you.

1:25:21.388 --> 1:25:22.356
Well, I don't want
to talk to you!

1:25:22.389 --> 1:25:23.390
Well I...

1:25:29.530 --> 1:25:31.164
I hear myself talking to her

1:25:31.198 --> 1:25:34.602
and I just can't stand the sound
of my own voice.

1:25:36.738 --> 1:25:41.576
I just can't help but feel
like I let her down.

1:25:43.210 --> 1:25:45.312
She will come back to you.

1:25:54.622 --> 1:25:56.356
It's not enough
to love somebody.

1:25:56.390 --> 1:26:00.528
You have to let them feel
that you love them.

1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:13.975
Hello?

1:26:14.008 --> 1:26:14.909
<i>Philip.</i>

1:26:14.942 --> 1:26:17.645
It's Michael Toff
over at Heritage Point.

1:26:17.679 --> 1:26:20.515
<i>I need to talk to you about uh,
James Flagg?</i>

1:26:20.548 --> 1:26:21.415
Okay.

1:26:21.448 --> 1:26:23.685
<i>He turned up here
at the hospital.</i>

1:26:23.718 --> 1:26:25.352
He's admitted himself?

1:26:25.385 --> 1:26:26.286
<i>Last night.</i>

1:26:26.319 --> 1:26:29.256
He said voices in his head
had returned,

1:26:29.289 --> 1:26:31.693
that he'd done a crazy thing
with his car?

1:26:31.726 --> 1:26:34.796
<i>He kept mumbling
about the park in Portland.</i>

1:26:34.829 --> 1:26:38.700
Oh, and uh, he's become
very agitated

1:26:38.733 --> 1:26:40.735
at the thought that
you won't see him.

1:26:40.768 --> 1:26:41.703
Okay.

1:26:41.736 --> 1:26:42.704
<i>But here's the deal.</i>

1:26:42.737 --> 1:26:44.639
The only person he says
he'll talk to is you.

1:26:44.672 --> 1:26:45.439
Oh.

1:26:45.472 --> 1:26:46.007
No, no.

1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:46.941
No.

1:26:46.974 --> 1:26:48.142
He won't authorize
release of his records,

1:26:48.176 --> 1:26:52.412
won't let us draw blood, get
any sort of medical profile.

1:26:52.446 --> 1:26:53.715
Consider this a
professional appeal

1:26:53.748 --> 1:26:56.349
from one clinician
to another.

1:27:00.454 --> 1:27:02.590
Jesus Christ.

1:27:02.623 --> 1:27:04.525
He wants to talk to me.

1:27:15.636 --> 1:27:17.705
This might be a mistake.

1:27:17.739 --> 1:27:19.674
This is all on your terms.

1:27:19.707 --> 1:27:21.274
The moment you're finished
with him,

1:27:21.308 --> 1:27:23.310
the interview's concluded.

1:27:25.479 --> 1:27:26.781
Thank you.

1:27:45.465 --> 1:27:47.367
Good afternoon,
Doctor Clark.

1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:50.905
James, tell me why I'm here.

1:27:50.938 --> 1:27:53.373
I need to say I'm sorry.

1:27:53.406 --> 1:27:54.709
I need to confess.

1:27:54.742 --> 1:27:56.309
I'm not a priest.

1:27:56.343 --> 1:27:58.345
Just listen to me.

1:27:58.378 --> 1:27:59.379
Okay?

1:27:59.412 --> 1:28:02.550
Just... just listen,
that's all you have to do.

1:28:05.119 --> 1:28:06.319
Okay.

1:28:09.624 --> 1:28:12.693
Did you ever meet him?

1:28:12.727 --> 1:28:14.394
The boyfriend.

1:28:14.427 --> 1:28:15.663
Daphne and her boyfriend.

1:28:15.696 --> 1:28:19.534
I think his name was Eric.

1:28:19.567 --> 1:28:20.902
Yeah.

1:28:20.935 --> 1:28:22.837
Tell me why I'm here.

1:28:27.141 --> 1:28:29.677
I have no novel I'm writing.

1:28:29.710 --> 1:28:31.378
Not now.

1:28:31.411 --> 1:28:32.647
Um...

1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:37.518
The secrets that I used,
they were yours.

1:28:37.552 --> 1:28:39.352
They were all yours.

1:28:42.523 --> 1:28:44.525
<i>Secrets I got from Daphne.</i>

1:28:45.860 --> 1:28:47.460
<i>From Daphne.</i>

1:28:48.996 --> 1:28:53.433
<i>From the book she was
starting about herself,</i>

1:28:53.466 --> 1:28:54.735
<i>and about you.</i>

1:28:56.704 --> 1:28:58.739
Everything you ever
told her,

1:28:58.773 --> 1:29:03.544
every little thing
about your life.

1:29:03.578 --> 1:29:06.948
She wrote it all down.

1:29:06.981 --> 1:29:10.785
And I read it.

1:29:10.818 --> 1:29:12.854
<i>About your wife.</i>

1:29:12.887 --> 1:29:15.590
<i>Your daughter.</i>

1:29:15.623 --> 1:29:17.925
<i>Every little thing.</i>

1:29:17.959 --> 1:29:20.695
<i>Every intimate detail.</i>

1:29:21.562 --> 1:29:23.598
Jesus Christ.

1:29:23.631 --> 1:29:25.766
And then I knocked
on your door.

1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:27.869
Why did you knock
on my door?

1:29:27.902 --> 1:29:29.003
I told you why.

1:29:29.036 --> 1:29:30.538
You haven't told me anything.

1:29:30.571 --> 1:29:32.472
There's, there's a curse.

1:29:32.506 --> 1:29:34.575
There's a curse on us,
all of us.

1:29:34.609 --> 1:29:36.944
On Daphne, on my mom,
on my dad.

1:29:36.978 --> 1:29:37.945
I don't care.

1:29:37.979 --> 1:29:39.580
What do you want from me?

1:29:39.614 --> 1:29:40.548
I'm sorry, all right?

1:29:40.581 --> 1:29:42.016
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1:29:42.049 --> 1:29:43.718
You're very sick.

1:29:43.751 --> 1:29:44.886
Philip.

1:29:44.919 --> 1:29:46.020
I'm so sorry.

1:29:46.053 --> 1:29:47.188
This absurd.

1:29:47.221 --> 1:29:48.556
We're done.
This is done.

1:29:48.589 --> 1:29:49.991
Okay. That's it.

1:29:50.457 --> 1:29:52.927
No, no, no, no, there's more.
There's more.

1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:54.729
There's no more.

1:29:55.096 --> 1:29:56.764
All the patients that stopped
coming, okay?

1:29:56.797 --> 1:29:59.499
All the letters I wrote
to your boss,

1:29:59.533 --> 1:30:03.571
to the State Board,
please forgive me, please.

1:30:03.604 --> 1:30:05.539
Please, I'm not finished.

1:30:05.573 --> 1:30:07.775
There's one more thing,
there's one amazing thing.

1:30:07.808 --> 1:30:09.543
Get him back
to his room now.

1:30:12.546 --> 1:30:14.548
Grace, I still smell her.

1:30:16.550 --> 1:30:17.685
Grace.

1:30:19.486 --> 1:30:20.487
I still smell her.

1:30:44.578 --> 1:30:45.913
Hello?

1:30:46.247 --> 1:30:48.582
<i>I think I'm feeling better.</i>

1:30:51.619 --> 1:30:55.856
Except for all these sounds
I keep hearing.

1:30:55.890 --> 1:30:57.658
Listen to me.

1:30:57.692 --> 1:30:59.560
Listen, you son of a bitch.

1:30:59.593 --> 1:31:02.596
<i>Don't you call here again.
This is over.</i>

1:31:02.630 --> 1:31:04.932
Click, click, click, click.

1:31:04.966 --> 1:31:06.834
Jesus Christ.

1:31:06.867 --> 1:31:09.770
Just tell me what the click,
click, click, click is.

1:31:09.804 --> 1:31:11.706
Please.

1:31:33.961 --> 1:31:35.830
I just wanted to share
some information with you

1:31:35.863 --> 1:31:39.867
that was relayed to me
by Doctor Toth.

1:31:39.900 --> 1:31:40.768
All right.

1:31:40.801 --> 1:31:42.603
Since James threatened you
last night,

1:31:42.636 --> 1:31:45.006
they have confiscated
his phone and isolated him.

1:31:45.039 --> 1:31:47.641
But he continues
to bring up Portland,

1:31:47.675 --> 1:31:50.611
some vision in his head
of the city at dawn.

1:31:50.644 --> 1:31:52.046
He said you'd understand.

1:31:52.079 --> 1:31:55.983
I told you that means
absolutely nothing to me.

1:31:56.017 --> 1:31:59.754
And Vanessa, please tell Doctor
Toth that our family's been

1:31:59.787 --> 1:32:04.058
through a lot and we'd like
our privacy now.

1:32:04.091 --> 1:32:06.027
I understand.

1:32:07.995 --> 1:32:10.998
I'm so sorry, Philip.

1:32:12.800 --> 1:32:15.069
It's all right.
It's all right.

1:32:15.102 --> 1:32:17.571
You've been wonderful,
thank you.

1:32:27.181 --> 1:32:28.716
So the food is in the oven.

1:32:28.749 --> 1:32:30.885
All you have to do
is heat it up, okay?

1:32:30.918 --> 1:32:32.920
Are you sure you don't want
to come with us?

1:32:32.953 --> 1:32:35.022
I'll be fine, Grace.

1:32:59.814 --> 1:33:02.083
Cell is clean, open up,
please.

1:33:06.987 --> 1:33:09.924
It's a beautiful place
with a view of the ocean.

1:33:09.957 --> 1:33:11.192
Oh, it sounds lovely.

1:33:11.225 --> 1:33:12.960
In Deep Cove.

1:33:12.993 --> 1:33:16.230
I can smell your...
your famous soda.

1:33:16.263 --> 1:33:18.099
Hence the mint.
Do you mind?

1:33:18.132 --> 1:33:19.066
Of course not.

1:33:19.100 --> 1:33:20.835
So I've spoken to the Board.

1:33:20.868 --> 1:33:21.836
Yes.

1:33:21.869 --> 1:33:25.806
We can put this
behind us now.

1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:28.976
You deserve to have
your life back, Philip.

1:33:33.948 --> 1:33:34.982
Before I forget...

1:33:35.015 --> 1:33:36.750
Thank you so much.

1:33:37.084 --> 1:33:38.953
As promised.

1:33:39.286 --> 1:33:40.221
That's the right one, eh?

1:33:40.254 --> 1:33:41.622
Yeah.

1:33:42.189 --> 1:33:43.124
There it is.

1:33:43.157 --> 1:33:43.991
What is it?

1:33:44.024 --> 1:33:44.925
The book.

1:33:44.959 --> 1:33:46.827
'Shadow Cast'.

1:33:47.094 --> 1:33:49.697
That red wine, mmm.

1:33:49.730 --> 1:33:50.731
Honestly.

1:33:52.032 --> 1:33:54.135
Please control yourself.

1:33:54.168 --> 1:33:56.670
Do you know what Stuart went
through to get a hold of this?

1:33:56.704 --> 1:33:57.771
Mmmhmm.

1:33:57.805 --> 1:33:59.807
It's amazing you found it.

1:34:05.179 --> 1:34:06.914
Oh, no.

1:34:06.947 --> 1:34:08.716
This isn't, uh...

1:34:10.851 --> 1:34:11.752
Philip?

1:34:12.253 --> 1:34:14.188
<i>What is it?</i>

1:34:29.236 --> 1:34:31.972
Oh, come on, answer
for Christ's sake.

1:34:32.006 --> 1:34:34.175
Toth, listen.
It's Philip Clark.

1:34:34.208 --> 1:34:37.044
James Flagg is very dangerous
and you need to lock him down.

1:34:37.077 --> 1:34:39.880
When he was saying Portland,
he was taunting us.

1:34:39.914 --> 1:34:42.917
I just got a call from London
that they have a James Flagg

1:34:42.950 --> 1:34:44.785
who's already
been admitted for...

1:34:44.818 --> 1:34:45.920
Toth, listen to me.

1:34:45.953 --> 1:34:46.954
He is not her brother.

1:34:46.987 --> 1:34:48.222
He is her boyfriend.

1:34:48.389 --> 1:34:51.158
<i>His name isn't James Flagg.
He's Eric Dalton.</i>

1:34:53.027 --> 1:34:54.828
Do you understand?
It's her boyfriend.

1:34:54.862 --> 1:34:56.797
I'm sorry, I just...
I don't...

1:34:56.830 --> 1:34:57.666
Listen to me.

1:34:57.698 --> 1:34:59.233
He's not British,
he's not a writer.

1:34:59.266 --> 1:35:01.068
<i>He's psychotic.</i>

1:35:01.101 --> 1:35:01.735
<i>He's her boyfriend.</i>

1:35:01.769 --> 1:35:04.138
<i>He's violent and abusive.</i>

1:35:04.539 --> 1:35:07.808
And in Portland he may have
killed my patient's friend.

1:35:07.841 --> 1:35:09.210
She's dead. Joan.

1:35:09.243 --> 1:35:10.811
<i>He did it to make her
so distraught</i>

1:35:10.844 --> 1:35:11.812
that she would take him back.

1:35:11.845 --> 1:35:13.714
But she didn't take him back.

1:35:14.114 --> 1:35:17.218
He made it look like a suicide,
but it wasn't a suicide.

1:35:17.251 --> 1:35:18.285
Why would he do something
like...

1:35:18.319 --> 1:35:21.088
<i>Because he's clinically insane.</i>

1:35:21.121 --> 1:35:22.856
It wasn't a suicide.

1:35:22.890 --> 1:35:24.058
He killed her.

1:35:24.091 --> 1:35:25.226
<i>Toth, listen to me!</i>

1:35:25.259 --> 1:35:27.061
Lock him down!

1:35:27.094 --> 1:35:27.861
God.

1:35:27.895 --> 1:35:28.896
Lock him down!

1:35:29.830 --> 1:35:31.065
Oh, Jesus.

1:35:35.202 --> 1:35:36.170
What?

1:35:36.203 --> 1:35:37.338
<i>He's... he's gone.</i>

1:35:37.371 --> 1:35:39.240
What do you mean,
he's gone?

1:35:54.054 --> 1:35:55.289
He thinks that I made
Daphne leave him,

1:35:55.322 --> 1:35:57.958
and he wants
to punish me.

1:35:57.992 --> 1:35:59.994
So he came after you.

1:36:04.031 --> 1:36:05.933
I walked away from him, Philip.

1:36:05.966 --> 1:36:06.568
I left him.

1:36:06.601 --> 1:36:07.434
He had me in his grasp.

1:36:07.468 --> 1:36:10.170
If he wanted to kill me,
he could have.

1:36:14.308 --> 1:36:15.209
- Lucy.
- Lucy.

1:36:25.986 --> 1:36:28.022
Come on, Lucy.
Straight to voicemail.

1:36:28.055 --> 1:36:30.291
Lucy, listen to me.

1:36:30.324 --> 1:36:32.326
Do not go outside.
Stay in the house.

1:36:32.359 --> 1:36:33.360
Lock every single door.

1:36:33.394 --> 1:36:35.262
We are on our way home.

1:36:39.333 --> 1:36:40.901
<i>911, what's
your emergency?</i>

1:36:40.934 --> 1:36:42.604
<i>My daughter is in danger.</i>

1:36:42.637 --> 1:36:43.404
- Hello?
- Ma'am, can you hear me?

1:36:43.437 --> 1:36:44.338
Shit.

1:36:45.272 --> 1:36:46.040
Call them back.

1:36:46.073 --> 1:36:47.041
I am.

1:36:56.950 --> 1:36:58.085
James.

1:36:59.353 --> 1:37:00.988
She's not picking up.

1:37:02.423 --> 1:37:03.190
Philip!

1:37:04.992 --> 1:37:06.393
Ugh, fuck.

1:37:12.099 --> 1:37:14.935
<i>Lucy, listen to me,
call me as soon as you get this!</i>

1:37:15.537 --> 1:37:20.240
<i>Do not go outside.
Lock every single door, Lucy.</i>

1:37:22.976 --> 1:37:24.378
- James.
- Hey.

1:37:25.379 --> 1:37:27.081
I knew you'd come.

1:37:29.249 --> 1:37:31.251
Better late than never.

1:37:38.992 --> 1:37:40.961
I need you to go get
your stuff, okay?

1:37:40.994 --> 1:37:42.096
We're going.

1:37:42.129 --> 1:37:44.198
- I'll be two seconds, I swear.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1:38:24.338 --> 1:38:25.406
Come on, we gotta go.

1:38:25.439 --> 1:38:28.208
Woah.

1:38:28.242 --> 1:38:29.910
We will.

1:38:30.512 --> 1:38:32.112
What?

1:38:32.312 --> 1:38:34.448
I have something I want
to show you.

1:38:35.282 --> 1:38:36.984
What?

1:38:37.017 --> 1:38:38.952
You heard me.

1:38:39.353 --> 1:38:41.922
James, why are you talking
like that?

1:38:42.322 --> 1:38:44.526
There's no hiding, right?

1:38:44.559 --> 1:38:46.427
- James, James.
- Shhhh, shhhh.

1:38:46.460 --> 1:38:48.095
I don't want to go now.

1:38:48.128 --> 1:38:49.263
I'm...

1:38:49.296 --> 1:38:50.532
All right.

1:38:50.565 --> 1:38:52.166
Just come with me.

1:38:52.199 --> 1:38:53.200
No, no...

1:38:53.233 --> 1:38:54.034
Just come with me.

1:38:54.067 --> 1:38:55.169
Please stop.

1:38:55.202 --> 1:38:57.137
Stop fighting, Lucy.

1:38:57.171 --> 1:38:57.672
Stop, stop!

1:38:57.705 --> 1:38:59.973
Lucy... PLAY NICE!

1:39:01.241 --> 1:39:02.176
Fuck!

1:39:05.078 --> 1:39:06.046
Go!

1:39:37.512 --> 1:39:39.146
<i>Oh my god,
that's his car!</i>

1:39:51.091 --> 1:39:52.025
Lucy!

1:39:52.292 --> 1:39:54.194
All you had to do was listen!

1:39:59.333 --> 1:40:00.434
Lucy!

1:40:00.802 --> 1:40:02.035
Dad!!!

1:40:03.538 --> 1:40:04.505
Fuck!

1:40:04.539 --> 1:40:05.607
Bitch!

1:40:11.278 --> 1:40:13.515
Here he is!
Here he is!

1:40:18.151 --> 1:40:19.119
Come on, Doc!

1:40:19.152 --> 1:40:20.287
Come on!

1:40:31.398 --> 1:40:32.600
Fight back, man!

1:40:39.707 --> 1:40:41.208
Hey, Grace.

1:40:49.584 --> 1:40:51.451
Come on, Doc!

1:40:53.621 --> 1:40:56.591
You can know
how it feels, Doc!

1:40:59.259 --> 1:41:03.031
You're going to know the pain!
You're going to know the pain!!

1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:08.402
Dad!

1:41:18.345 --> 1:41:20.414
Look what you made me do, Doc.

1:41:22.382 --> 1:41:24.151
Look what you made me do.

1:41:27.254 --> 1:41:29.323
This is for Daphne.
