EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #059
"Everybody Hates Run-DMC"
CLOSED CAPTIONED

00:02.503 --> 00:02.970
("You Be Illin'" by Run-DMC
playing)

00:07.808 --> 00:11.112
CHRIS ROCK:
For as long as I can remember,
music was a part of my life.

00:11.145 --> 00:15.416
And in 1986, the biggest act
in the world was Run-DMC.

00:15.449 --> 00:19.653
* One day when I was chillin'
in Kentucky Fried Chicken *

00:19.687 --> 00:23.457
* Just minding my business,
eatin' food and finger lickin' *

00:23.491 --> 00:26.660
* This dude walked in looking
strange and kind of funny *

00:26.694 --> 00:28.329
What you listening
to, young blood?

00:28.362 --> 00:29.763
Young blood...

00:29.797 --> 00:31.099
what you listening to?

00:31.132 --> 00:32.200
Run-DMC.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.834
What kind of name
is "Run"?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.436
Ain't that a verb,
everybody?

00:36.604 --> 00:37.705
Going to that concert?

00:37.738 --> 00:40.108
I wish.
It's sold out.

00:40.141 --> 00:43.111
I've got a guy that's gonna give
me two tickets tomorrow.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.545
They're yours for $200.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.714
I don't have $200.
I'll take 'em.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.449
Okay, I'll have them
tomorrow at 6:00.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.118
And I'm gonna need cash.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.120
Now I don't take
check, credit,

00:52.153 --> 00:53.787
pesos, rubles,

00:53.821 --> 00:56.224
wampums, ducats
or wherewithal.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.158
No problem.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.860
As long as you can also
loan me $200.

00:59.893 --> 01:00.861
Hey, everybody.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.496
Hey, what's going on?
Hey.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.266
Manny, you mind if I
leave these here?
What is it?

01:05.299 --> 01:08.702
Applications for
my BFD Scholarship.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.138
BFD?

01:10.171 --> 01:11.739
Black Funeral Directors.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.507
What I was thinking
wasn't even close.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.476
:
You, too, right?

01:15.509 --> 01:16.744
So if you know of any young men

01:16.777 --> 01:20.448
who would like to learn about
the wonderful world of death,

01:20.481 --> 01:24.385
this scholarship
is worth $250.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.187
Sounds like ticket money to me.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.155
I'm interested.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.422
Interested in free money.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.790
Oh, I didn't know
you were interested

01:29.823 --> 01:31.325
in the bereaved and deceased.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.294
I'm not.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.895
This is a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.265
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.768
All you have to do
is sign right here

01:40.801 --> 01:42.536
and you're the new
BFD scholar.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.637
Good.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.239
Now when do I
get the money?

01:45.273 --> 01:47.208
Oh, as soon as you're
done with the program.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.810
Will I be done with the program
by tomorrow at 6:00?

01:49.843 --> 01:51.279
Oh, it's gonna take
longer than that

01:51.312 --> 01:53.181
to learn all you need to know
about death.

01:53.214 --> 01:56.317
No, it's not, because right now
I'm having a heart attack.

01:59.587 --> 02:03.657

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

02:04.725 --> 02:07.195
* Aw, make it funky now

02:29.917 --> 02:30.984
While I waited
for my scholarship money,

02:31.018 --> 02:33.921
I was researching other ways
to get some cash.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.189
Give you an advance on your pay?

02:35.223 --> 02:38.259
Yeah, and I'll pay you back soon
as I get my scholarship money.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.528
That sounds like
a good plan.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.563
But what happens
if you get killed?

02:42.596 --> 02:43.897
I haven't thought
about that.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.299
Ain't that nothing.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.600
You learning about death

02:46.634 --> 02:49.203
and ain't even
thought about dying.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.572
Death can happen
at any moment, son.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.641
It can happen
when you're happy,

02:53.674 --> 02:56.344
when you're sad, or when
you owe somebody money.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.246
Translation: no.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.316
While I was hurting for cash,
my mother was in pain.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.385
So the chart says you
got pain in your shoulder.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.286
How did you do this?

03:05.319 --> 03:07.721
I was reaching for something

03:07.755 --> 03:09.357
and I must've overextended.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.824
That's one way of putting it.

03:10.858 --> 03:14.295
Boy, didn't I tell you
about throwing that ball?!

03:14.328 --> 03:16.230
Mama, I didn't mean
to break it, I'm sorry.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.232
Oh, your behind
gonna be sorry.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.234
Ow! Ow!

03:20.268 --> 03:23.404
Went too far back on
the wind

03:23.437 --> 03:24.171
Yeah!

03:24.204 --> 03:26.340
You know that boy
broke a $60 lamp

03:26.374 --> 03:29.343
when I told him do not
throw a ball in the house.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.312
Next time, just stretch first.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.813
Stretch?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.948
Nothing helps you give better
ass whuppings than yoga.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.285
It's part of the
proper technique.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.988
There are various techniques
that you can use to avoid injury

03:41.021 --> 03:42.189
while delivering
an ass whupping.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.925
There's the Two-Cheek Cross,
the Roundhouse Booty Buster,

03:44.958 --> 03:47.628
or my personal favorite:
the Kunta Kinte Will Breaker.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.331
In the wrong hands, a beating
can be called child abuse.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.032
But in the right hands,
it could be the difference

03:52.065 --> 03:54.535
between raising
a Bill Gates or a Bobby Brown.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.373
Read this.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.575
If you rest your arm
in a sling for a week,

04:01.609 --> 04:02.743
you'll be fine.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.378
A week?
I can't rest for a week.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.480
I got to cook and clean.
You're hurt.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.349
Make those kids do it.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.285
Strap me up.
Mm-hmm.

04:11.319 --> 04:14.622
My mother had a sling,
while my father had ch-ching.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.357
What's this?

04:16.390 --> 04:17.891
I've got a fun project
for you.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.928
My father was famous
for his fun projects.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.835
JULIUS:
Isn't this fun?

04:27.868 --> 04:30.471
What is this
stuff anyway?
Asbestos.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.640
We're gonna save a lot of money
on heat this year.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.975
I need you to roll
these quarters.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.377
40 in each roll.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.380
You think you can
handle that, baby?

04:39.413 --> 04:40.481
Okay, Daddy.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.550
That's my girl.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.386
I had a hundred dollars saved,
and I had to get the rest

04:45.419 --> 04:49.089
or my chance to see Run-DMC
was gonna be G-O-N-E.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.824
So, Dad, can I borrow
a hundred dollars

04:50.858 --> 04:52.560
until my scholarship money
arrives?

04:52.593 --> 04:53.727
That depends.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.363
Can I borrow it back
two seconds later?

04:55.396 --> 04:56.597
For what?

04:56.630 --> 04:57.798
Books.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.433
Mr. Omar gave you a scholarship.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.901
What, he can't give you
the books?

05:00.934 --> 05:02.370
I get $250.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.371
Wow.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.506
They got any more
scholarships around here?

05:05.539 --> 05:06.374
I don't know.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.941
The Future Crackheads
of America

05:07.975 --> 05:09.109
had a scholarship,

05:09.142 --> 05:11.345
but they used that up
on Flavor Flav.

05:11.379 --> 05:14.047
Well, I guess it's
for a good cause.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.949
Turn around so
I can get the money.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.820
Okay.

05:19.853 --> 05:23.424
I never did find out where my
father kept his secret stash.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.525
Here you go.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.395
Thanks, Dad.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.629
Thank you.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.799
My father held onto cash
so tight,

05:31.832 --> 05:34.001
George Washington
couldn't breathe.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.004
39...

05:37.037 --> 05:39.373
40.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.477
According to math,
the roll was perfect.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.912
But according to Tanya,

05:44.945 --> 05:48.549
39 quarters looked
a lot neater than 40.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.650
That's better.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.521
Bam!

05:53.554 --> 05:55.423
We're going to
the Run-DMC concert.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.124
Dude, this is
incredible.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.560
I promise I'll pay you back,
ten dollars a week.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.462
This is the best thing
anyone's ever done for me

06:01.495 --> 06:03.397
since my mom took me back
from the foster home.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.998
Well, we couldn't miss the
greatest concert of the year.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.133
Where'd you get the money?

06:06.166 --> 06:07.735
Oh, my dad
loaned it to me

06:07.768 --> 06:09.503
and I'm gonna pay him back
with my scholarship money.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.571
What scholarship?

06:10.604 --> 06:11.505
BFD.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.573
Never heard of
that one before.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.442
But I'm guessing
acronyms today--

06:14.475 --> 06:15.776
Black Funeral Directors.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.545
Yeah, you have
a scholarship?

06:17.578 --> 06:18.378
Yeah, I've got four:

06:18.412 --> 06:20.548
Future Physicists,
Future Pharmacists,

06:20.581 --> 06:22.149
Future Futurists,
and Sons of Izzo.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.116
Who's Izzo?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.085
It's an Italian thing,
you wouldn't understand.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.487
Oh.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.088
So you want to be
a funeral director?

06:28.121 --> 06:29.990
No, I just want
to see Run-DMC.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.925
Duh!

06:31.959 --> 06:33.661
My mother was
about to win an Emmy

06:33.694 --> 06:35.729
for best exaggerated injury.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.197
Yeah, get the pillow.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.499
Ooh.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.967
Oh...

06:40.000 --> 06:41.769
Now I wish I wasn't hurt,

06:41.802 --> 06:43.504
but I am.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.939
So I'm gonna need you two to
pick up the slack around here,

06:45.973 --> 06:47.508
okay?
What do we have to do?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.677
:
Not a lot.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.245
All of this?!

06:52.279 --> 06:55.082
Now you can appreciate all
the hard work I do around here.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.149
Ow! Ow!

06:56.183 --> 06:58.151
Drew, go get
my turtles.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.488
Tanya, put my feet up.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.456
You know my ankles swell.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.557
Pass me the remote.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.194
Move out the way.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.630
You're blocking the TV.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.866
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.535
Come on here, girl.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.869
You can do it, sister.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.472
Come on, joker...!
Come on, joker!

07:18.506 --> 07:20.007
Yes!

07:20.040 --> 07:22.910
You should've seen her
when she watched Card Sharks.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.613
Now that I was going
to the show,

07:25.646 --> 07:28.516
I couldn't wait for Mr. Omar
to show me the money.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.417
Hey, Mr. Omar,

07:30.450 --> 07:32.520
I was just wondering
what I needed to do

07:32.553 --> 07:33.453
to finish up
my scholarship work.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.189
Oh, I appreciate your
enthusiasm, Chris.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.726
As you know, death doesn't
wait, so come on in.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.661
I'm just finishing up
my preparation

07:40.694 --> 07:41.762
for the death Jubilee.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.830
Sweep that up.

07:42.863 --> 07:43.997
Death Jubilee?

07:44.031 --> 07:46.033
Oh, it's only the biggest
event of the year.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.568
It's like the auto show.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.036
If you drive a hearse.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.871
Now, look, I need you
to collate these,

07:50.904 --> 07:52.773
fold these,
take both of them,

07:52.806 --> 07:54.241
slide them into here, okay?

07:54.274 --> 07:55.976
I need you to iron that shirt,
take the suit

07:56.009 --> 07:57.678
to the cleaners,
shine my shoes,

07:57.711 --> 07:59.112
get me a paper
on the corner...

07:59.146 --> 08:01.615
I got a lotta more stuff for you
to do later.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.951
Oh, the Death Jubilee
is all day tomorrow,

08:03.984 --> 08:05.085
so get your rest.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.754
You mean get
your rest in peace.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.121
Now when you think I'll be done?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.823
Oh, you should be done
by Tuesday.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.959
Tuesday? But I have somewhere
to go on Monday.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.727
Go on Tuesday.
I can't.

08:13.761 --> 08:14.662
Tragic.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.896
Not as tragic

08:15.929 --> 08:17.631
as missing Run-DMC.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.904
At the Death Jubilee,

08:23.937 --> 08:26.874
I was beginning to realize
that the BFD

08:26.907 --> 08:27.808
was a bunch of BS.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.679
Hey, Omar,
the scholarship idea? Genius.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.582
Hey, I could never afford to
come to this convention before

08:34.615 --> 08:35.683
'cause it cost so much for help.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.117
But you call it a scholarship

08:37.150 --> 08:39.219
and you get help
for less than half the price.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.622
Hey, did you guys
see the women

08:41.655 --> 08:42.455
over in the
bereavement hall?

08:42.489 --> 08:44.992
If you thought
last year was good,

08:45.025 --> 08:46.259
this year is ridiculous.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.227
Oh, you think
that's ridiculous?

08:47.260 --> 08:49.763
Did you see the girl
standing by the hearse?

08:49.797 --> 08:50.964
Now she's bad for business.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.633
Who's gonna die with her
standing around.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.603
Oh, my God.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.337
You know Mrs. Eisenberg?
She called me.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.840
Mrs. Eisenberg,
Mrs. Eisenberg?
Yeah.

08:59.873 --> 09:00.908
You're kidding.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.242
I'm not kidding you.
We went out.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.343
She's a firecracker.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.978
Almost gave me a heart attack.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.714
I told you not to mess with her.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.749
Well, her husband was
on bed rest for a year.

09:08.782 --> 09:09.750
What can you expect?

09:09.783 --> 09:10.684
I didn't expect that.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.921
Hey, tragic.

09:17.157 --> 09:17.958
I'm done.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.627
What do you want me
to do with this?

09:19.660 --> 09:22.930
Oh.
Right... here.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.201
You know, you might have
a future in this after all.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.838
Back at home, my mother found
that taking it easy

09:30.871 --> 09:33.140
was gonna be harder
than she thought.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.611
Hey, Mom, how do you fold this?

09:37.645 --> 09:39.647
With your hands, dummy.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.020
Hey, Mom,

09:47.054 --> 09:49.823
can you clean burnt
spaghetti sauce with bleach?

09:49.857 --> 09:51.625
If you want to die.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.062
DREW:
Hey, Mom!

09:56.429 --> 09:58.031
TANYA:
Mom...!

09:58.065 --> 09:59.099
Ma..!

09:59.132 --> 10:00.768
Mom!

10:00.801 --> 10:03.671
While my mother's legs
were getting stronger,

10:03.704 --> 10:06.606
Mr. Omar's little black book
was getting fatter.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.984
Oh, thank you so much

10:17.017 --> 10:18.652
for stopping by.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.655
Now you be sure
and call me now, okay?

10:21.689 --> 10:23.023
All right?

10:28.729 --> 10:29.496
Hey.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.364
Oh, did you pass out
the pamphlets?

10:31.398 --> 10:32.666
Yeah...

10:32.700 --> 10:33.667
Only to the pretty ones?

10:33.701 --> 10:34.868
Yeah.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.170
So, you're supposed to be
telling me about your business?

10:37.204 --> 10:38.238
What you want to know?

10:38.271 --> 10:41.709
Well, what made you want
to work with dead people?

10:41.742 --> 10:43.276
You see, there's something
you need to know

10:43.310 --> 10:44.277
about the funeral business.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.046
It's not about servicing
the dead.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.683
It's about comforting
the living.

10:49.717 --> 10:50.951
And some
of the living need

10:50.984 --> 10:52.252
a little more comforting
than others.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.121
Go out to the truck,
get us some pamphlets.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.689
I'll be right back.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.126
Toast?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.728
Toast for dinner?

11:00.761 --> 11:02.095
Tonya can't cook

11:02.129 --> 11:03.797
and it's the best
that I could do

11:03.831 --> 11:04.932
in the condition
that I'm in.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.234
She's using most of her energy
faking being hurt.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.869
Ow!

11:08.902 --> 11:10.403
Thank you.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.707
Chris, why don't you
pass the toast around?

11:13.741 --> 11:14.607
See? I got

11:14.641 --> 11:17.978
wheat toast
and white toast and raisin

11:18.011 --> 11:19.880
and crust and crustless.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.114
No pumpernickel?

11:21.148 --> 11:24.818
Mommy also has grape jelly,
strawberry jelly, hot sauce...

11:24.852 --> 11:25.853
Hot sauce?

11:25.886 --> 11:26.787
Hot sauce?
...cinnamon,

11:26.820 --> 11:29.322
...honey and syrup
to dip your crust in.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.491
Hot sauce?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.761
Um, did you finish up
those quarters like I asked?

11:33.794 --> 11:34.962
Yep, ten rolls.

11:34.995 --> 11:35.929
Good girl.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.898
Hey, Chris, can you pass me
the hot sauce?

11:37.931 --> 11:39.733
Hot sauce?

11:39.767 --> 11:41.434
So Chris, how was your day?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.470
Did you learn anything
about the funeral business?

11:43.503 --> 11:45.238
I learned it was heavy.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.306
Yeah, I bet it is.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.474
You enjoying those books?

11:47.507 --> 11:49.309
Yeah, they're great.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.912
Pass me the big piece
of toast.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.383
Honey, how much longer
you gonna be in that sling?

11:56.416 --> 11:57.885
Until we run out of bread.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.119
I don't know,
Julius.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.354
As soon as I'm healed
and fully recovered,

12:01.388 --> 12:02.389
I'll let you know.

12:03.991 --> 12:04.958
Ow!

12:04.992 --> 12:07.494
While my mother was milking
her injury,

12:07.527 --> 12:08.561
I was being trained.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.531
First, I must say
you're really doing
a great job.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.233
Well, what do I have
to do today?

12:13.266 --> 12:15.502
Ah, just polish
a few coffins.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.304
A few?

12:17.337 --> 12:18.839
How long is this gonna take?

12:18.872 --> 12:19.873
I don't know.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.875
Well, you think I'll be done
by tomorrow night?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.777
Because I have somewhere to go
and it's really important.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.913
Chris, there's nothing
more important

12:25.946 --> 12:27.915
than fulfilling
your responsibilities.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.483
That's what this scholarship
is all about: service.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.985
So do your best.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.821
If you get it done,

12:33.854 --> 12:35.522
tomorrow you can do
whatever you want.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.791
Okay, well, how clean
do they have to be?

12:37.825 --> 12:41.028
Well, I need you
to make these

12:41.061 --> 12:44.965
look like this,
all right?

12:44.998 --> 12:46.533
So do your best.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.801
I'll see you later.

12:47.835 --> 12:48.936
Lock up
after you leave.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.537
You are the best.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.812
By the time I finished
cleaning those coffins,

12:58.846 --> 13:01.414
I almost needed one,
but it was worth it

13:01.448 --> 13:04.084
because come tomorrow, I was
gonna have the time of my life.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.518
What time do you
want to meet

13:05.552 --> 13:07.154
and go to the Garden?
You know what?

13:07.187 --> 13:09.422
You go without me
and I'll meet you down there.
What?

13:09.456 --> 13:11.859
I have to go by
the funeral parlor after school

13:11.892 --> 13:13.827
to make sure there's nothing
Mr. Omar wants me to do.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.262
I don't want
to have him think

13:15.295 --> 13:17.464
there's any reason for him
not to give me my money.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.465
I don't know
why you took

13:18.498 --> 13:19.299
that scholarship
anyway.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.369
Did you have $200
for concert tickets?

13:22.402 --> 13:23.470
No. Here.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.471
Don't be illing, man.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.839
I'll see you at 7:30.

13:25.873 --> 13:26.840
All right.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.341
For my father,

13:28.375 --> 13:30.243
coin-cashing day was better
than Christmas morning.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.312
$97.50.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.580
No, that can't be right.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.282
I know I had
a hundred dollars here.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.884
Did you count it?
No.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.318
Well, I did.
It was $97.50.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.920
Well, maybe you made a mistake.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.188
No, maybe you made
a mistake.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.222
You think you're
the first person

13:42.255 --> 13:43.590
try to skim a few quarters
past us?

13:43.623 --> 13:45.926
Actually, he was
the first person to try it,

13:45.959 --> 13:47.460
but that was a long time ago.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.133
Back at Mr. Omar's,
it was almost quitting time

13:53.166 --> 13:56.069
and I was three minutes away
from Run-DMC.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.971
Hey, Greg. Yeah.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.639
So we're still good, right?

13:59.672 --> 14:00.874
Oh, okay.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.910
No, all I have to do
is lock up.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.312
I'm out of here
in, like, two minutes.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.915
So I'll meet you at the Garden?

14:07.948 --> 14:09.983
All right, cool.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.054
I had finished all my dealings
with death

14:14.087 --> 14:16.223
and now it was time to get ill.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.562
Excuse me.
Can you help me?

14:22.595 --> 14:26.066
I can... but I don't want to.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.539
Sorry.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.673
I was just locking up,

14:33.706 --> 14:35.909
but I'm sure Mr. Omar could talk
to you in the morning.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.410
Oh, it'll only
take a minute.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.946
You see,
my husband passed

14:38.979 --> 14:41.248
and Mr. Omar wanted me
to bring a tie

14:41.281 --> 14:42.382
to go with the outfit,

14:42.415 --> 14:44.985
and I just can't decide.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.086
What do you think?

14:46.119 --> 14:47.087
Blue or green?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.688
Green.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.358
Oh, yeah, green.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.359
Leonard liked green.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.994
Okay.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.196
Well, I'm gonna give this
to Mr. Omar in the morning,

14:56.229 --> 14:57.197
but we can leave.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.198
Yeah.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.267
Maybe blue would be better.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.602
He was an executive,
you know.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.471
Okay.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.006
Blue it is.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.211
No, you're right. Green.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.545
Now tell me,

15:12.579 --> 15:14.047
do you think
I should get socks

15:14.081 --> 15:16.083
to match the tie?

15:16.116 --> 15:18.051
This will only take a minute...

15:18.085 --> 15:19.252
in old people time.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.324
That's perfect.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.427
You remind me
of him, you know?

15:27.460 --> 15:32.065
He used to have that same look
you have right now.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.167
Frustration?

15:34.201 --> 15:36.003
You keep looking
at the clock.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.071
Is there someplace
you supposed to be?

15:38.105 --> 15:39.672
Yeah, I'm supposed
to be meeting a friend.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.575
Oh, that's nice.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.177
I don't mean to hold you up.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.512
Then let me go.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.081
Leonard had friends now.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.050
Yes, there was Earl,

15:50.083 --> 15:53.186
Louis, Zeke, Sonny.

15:53.220 --> 15:56.089
Sonny, Sonny had one eye

15:56.123 --> 15:58.525
and he got
into a fight

15:58.558 --> 16:00.293
with Chester Jenkins.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.196
He love watching sitcom,

16:03.230 --> 16:05.232
especially Sanford & Son.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.634
He loved
Sanford & Son.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.103
:
I'm coming, Elizabeth!

16:12.605 --> 16:15.008
This man could cook.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.044
You talk about fried chicken?

16:17.077 --> 16:20.113
His chicken was so good,

16:20.147 --> 16:22.249
chickens be at the table
talking.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.483
"Whoa, this some good chicken.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.584
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa."

16:24.617 --> 16:26.619
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

16:26.653 --> 16:30.157
Bend it down.
Bend it down. Come on.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.660
Ooh, you good.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.363
You good, but you're
not as good as Leonard.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.530
Ow! Stop!

16:37.564 --> 16:39.099
I was missing Run-DMC,

16:39.132 --> 16:41.134
but my father was really
missing his quarters.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.036
Shouldn't you be
at work, baby?

16:43.070 --> 16:45.272
Rachelle, I think

16:45.305 --> 16:46.673
Tonya may have stolen
from me.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.041
What?!

16:48.075 --> 16:49.609
I went to the bank

16:49.642 --> 16:52.579
and the quarters I had her
roll up for me came up short.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.447
Oh, no, my daughter
is not gonna grow up

16:54.481 --> 16:55.615
to be a thief.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.284
We're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.685
I still got one
good arm left.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.686
No, no, no.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.254
Ow! Ow, ow.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.355
I'll talk to her.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.191
You just get some rest.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.158
Okay.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.626
Thank you, baby.

17:06.659 --> 17:10.363
My father hated to think
that Tonya had stolen again,

17:10.397 --> 17:13.266
but he also hated
being short $2.50.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.834
Tonya,

17:14.867 --> 17:17.170
did you roll those quarters
like I told you to?

17:17.204 --> 17:18.138
Yeah. Why?

17:18.171 --> 17:19.606
When I went to the bank,

17:19.639 --> 17:22.142
every one of those rolls
was a quarter short.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.776
What happened to the rest
of my money?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.146
Well, I took one quarter
out of each roll.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.748
You didn't think anybody
wouldn't notice that?

17:33.186 --> 17:35.255
What did you do
with the money, Tonya?

17:35.288 --> 17:36.756
Well, I was trying to save

17:36.789 --> 17:39.192
to make you
another roll.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.093
Save for another roll?

17:40.127 --> 17:41.494
Yeah.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.630
You didn't think I was
stealing from you, did you?

17:43.663 --> 17:45.765
No, of course not.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.267
Well, that's what
it sounds like to me.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.102
No, no, that's not
what it sounds like.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.437
I'm just saying...
Huh?!

17:50.470 --> 17:54.207
Look, your mother,
she needs some help.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.643
Look, here, take that
and buy some candy
or something, okay?

17:56.676 --> 17:57.744
No, Daddy,
you keep it.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.547
Coming, baby!
Coming!

18:03.650 --> 18:05.785
Oh, I'm gonna miss him!

18:05.818 --> 18:09.522
But you know what?
He had a good life.

18:09.556 --> 18:13.193
Yeah, sounds like
you two got along.

18:13.226 --> 18:16.129
Oh, no, he was
a pain in the ass.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.139
But he was my pain
in the ass.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.242
Yeah.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.479
Young man,
can I tell you something?

18:32.512 --> 18:34.747
What's that?

18:37.417 --> 18:40.553
This is the best
I've felt in days.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.788
Thank you.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.423
You're welcome.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.657
Come on.

18:44.691 --> 18:48.195
I know there's someplace
you got to be.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.769
There was someplace
I wanted to be,

18:56.803 --> 18:59.772
but I was right where
I needed to be.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.180
Hey, what happened?
Where were you?

19:07.214 --> 19:08.648
I can't believe you missed it.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.817
Got tied up at the funeral home.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.286
I told you that scholarship
thing was a bad idea.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.322
It's all right.
I'll catch 'em next time.

19:15.355 --> 19:18.358
Next time?
There won't be a next time.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.459
It was incredible.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.895
It was Aerosmith and Run-DMC
singing "Walk This Way."

19:22.929 --> 19:23.930
I couldn't believe it, man.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.567
When I saw someone in distress,
I gave comfort.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.536
Greg had a different approach.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.305
But my mother pretending
to have a pain in her arm

19:32.339 --> 19:35.408
was becoming a real
pain in the neck.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.319
TONYA/DREW:
Ma!

19:46.353 --> 19:49.289
Uh! Okay, okay, I'm fine!

19:49.322 --> 19:52.459
I'm up, okay?!
Are you happy now?!

19:52.492 --> 19:54.594
I mean, what does a woman
have to do

19:54.627 --> 19:57.897
to get some rest around here,
get shot?!

19:57.930 --> 20:01.268
I thought the BFD scholarship
was gonna be easy money,

20:01.301 --> 20:02.602
but I was dead wrong.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.604
At least I was finally
about to get paid.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.638
Here you go.

20:05.672 --> 20:09.576
A voucher for $250
worth of books.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.577
Books?

20:10.610 --> 20:11.611
Books?

20:11.644 --> 20:12.745
Books?

20:12.779 --> 20:14.581
Well, you didn't think
you were getting cash, did you?

20:14.614 --> 20:16.983
Good night.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.318
Tragic.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.586
You owe me a hundred dollars.

20:19.619 --> 20:24.824
* Everybody hates Chris.
