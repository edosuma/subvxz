WEBVTT

00:01.166 --> 00:03.125
(ominous music)
- You said it was one uphill.

00:03.208 --> 00:05.583
- Oh God shut up!
- And a bunch of downhill

00:05.667 --> 00:08.166
- This is like the third uphill.

00:09.208 --> 00:14.458
Like, I thought it would
be kind of, mostly down.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.082
- Why would you think that?
- I don't know.

00:16.166 --> 00:17.959
- It's a mountain.
- Yeah.

00:18.041 --> 00:18.917
I didn't think it was that big.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.375
I'm sweatin' my balls off, here.

00:20.458 --> 00:21.792
Are we gettin' close
to this place or what?

00:21.875 --> 00:24.083
- We're closer than we were.

00:24.166 --> 00:24.792
Hand me the map.

00:24.875 --> 00:27.333
- Now if you ask me,

00:28.625 --> 00:30.417
you've got us on a
wild goose chase.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.625
- Oh, well lucky no
one's asking you.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.542
Now, if my calculations
are accurate,

00:42.583 --> 00:44.250
and I know for a fact they are,

00:46.542 --> 00:47.875
pot of gold should be right
between them hills, there.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.667
(ominous music)

00:52.583 --> 00:53.792
Come on, Buddy.

00:55.375 --> 00:56.417
Move your ass.

00:58.375 --> 01:01.375
Come on, let's go.
- Alright, alright.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.834
Them hills are so far away, Dug.

01:05.917 --> 01:08.625
You know somethin, Dug?

01:08.709 --> 01:12.500
I'm startin' to have some
reservations about all this.

01:12.583 --> 01:15.500
Stealin' is stealin', no
matter how you slice it.

01:15.583 --> 01:17.959
- Look around you, Buddy.

01:18.041 --> 01:20.458
All this here is
designated National Forest.

01:20.542 --> 01:24.667
Therefore as American citizens,
whatever grows out here

01:24.750 --> 01:27.041
is just as much ours
as anybody else's.

01:27.125 --> 01:29.166
It says so in the Constitution.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.959
Besides, we're
stealin' from criminals

01:32.041 --> 01:34.875
so it don't count the same.

01:34.959 --> 01:36.000
- Yeah, if they're
the criminals though,

01:36.083 --> 01:36.834
what's that make us?

01:36.917 --> 01:38.333
- Opportunists.

01:38.417 --> 01:39.166
- No, I don't like that.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.750
I mean we're
stealin' from stuff,

01:40.834 --> 01:42.125
we're begging for trouble

01:42.208 --> 01:43.166
if we're gonna be stealin'--
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.125
Shut up your yappin' ass up!

01:44.208 --> 01:46.000
- What? What's wrong?

01:46.083 --> 01:48.834
- You tellin' me you don't
see that behind that tree?

01:48.917 --> 01:50.583
- See what?
- There.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.709
It was somethin' strange.

01:56.625 --> 01:57.834
- What like a critter?

01:57.917 --> 01:59.667
- No, bigger than that.

01:59.750 --> 02:03.667
It was like the forest
come alive for a second.

02:05.333 --> 02:05.375
Nothing.

02:07.834 --> 02:09.083
- Hey man...

02:09.166 --> 02:10.542
Hey, you dehydrated, man.

02:10.625 --> 02:13.041
Here I got something for
you to wet your whistle.

02:13.125 --> 02:14.041
Some water here.

02:14.125 --> 02:14.959
This is what I'm talkin' about,

02:15.041 --> 02:16.542
this is bad news bein' out here.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.125
If them stories are true...

02:18.208 --> 02:19.000
Hold up, hold up.

02:19.083 --> 02:21.500
Wait, wait, wait, wait for me.

02:22.875 --> 02:23.792
(ominous music)
- I'm not the one that ate

02:23.875 --> 02:24.875
the last granola bar, asshole.

02:24.959 --> 02:27.500
- [Buddy] I got hungry, man.

02:27.583 --> 02:28.417
Shouldn't leave them in my bag.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.709
Why'd you put them in my bag

02:29.792 --> 02:31.083
if you knew I was
gonna eat them?

02:31.166 --> 02:33.542
You know hungry I get.
- Can't carry that much weight

02:33.625 --> 02:35.125
- Hey man, look it's not too
late to just double back.

02:35.208 --> 02:38.417
Like, we can go home,
have a couple beers,

02:38.500 --> 02:40.959
rub one out, not
together, separately.

02:41.041 --> 02:42.458
What do you say,
man, you listening?

02:42.542 --> 02:44.375
Are you even listening to me?

02:44.458 --> 02:48.166
- I ain't listening to
a word you are saying.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.125
- Oh, oh!

02:51.583 --> 02:53.417
- Do you see what
I'm talkin' about?

02:53.500 --> 02:55.500
That's what I'm talkin' about!

02:55.583 --> 02:55.625
Holy shit!

02:57.083 --> 02:58.709
Caught them right
at harvest, too.

02:58.792 --> 03:01.959
(laughing)

03:12.208 --> 03:12.917
What the hell are
you waitin for?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.792
A written invitation?

03:14.875 --> 03:16.041
Pack that shit up.

03:16.125 --> 03:17.917
I wanna go look at
the rest of this.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.834
- Yes, sir.
- Oh yeah!

03:25.291 --> 03:27.208
Buddy it goes back and oh shit.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.959
Yeah, oh you're a
pretty one ain't ya?

03:30.041 --> 03:32.125
- I'm gon call you Mary.

03:32.208 --> 03:33.959
I'm gon call you Jane.

03:34.041 --> 03:37.542
- (coughing) Oh, goddamn.

03:39.709 --> 03:42.083
Oh, yeah!

03:42.166 --> 03:44.333
Don't mind me, I'm just
sampling the merchandise.

03:44.417 --> 03:47.041
(ominous music)

03:47.125 --> 03:48.375
- Dude, there's
somebody behind you.

03:48.458 --> 03:49.709
- Where?

03:49.792 --> 03:50.834
- Well, there was.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.208
But he's not there now.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.875
But he was, I saw somebody.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.125
At least I thought I did.

03:55.208 --> 03:57.166
- What the hell is
the matter with you?

03:57.250 --> 03:58.083
Are you trying to give
me a heart attack?

03:58.166 --> 03:59.000
- I'm sorry, Dug.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.208
I didn't mean to scare you.

04:00.291 --> 04:01.250
- Jackass.

04:08.625 --> 04:11.834
(suspenseful music)

04:11.917 --> 04:12.834
- Alright, I'm finished.

04:12.917 --> 04:15.792
Let's get the hell
out of here before...

04:15.875 --> 04:17.791
Hey man, where'd you go?

04:17.875 --> 04:19.709
Hey, come on man,
this ain't funny.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.416
Dug?

04:22.917 --> 04:23.875
Dug, come on man, how much
of that weed did you smoke?

04:23.959 --> 04:27.417
(ominous music)

04:30.000 --> 04:30.917
Oh no, no!

04:31.000 --> 04:34.125
(suspenseful music)

05:34.583 --> 05:37.208
(upbeat music)

05:42.750 --> 05:46.291
(women in car chattering)

05:55.333 --> 05:56.291
- Alrighty kids, look alive.

05:56.375 --> 05:57.250
We're walkin' the
rest of the way.

05:57.333 --> 05:58.458
- [Michelle] This isn't it?

05:58.542 --> 06:00.917
- [Aubrey] No, it's
further inland.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.417
- You mean there's no
roads to get there?

06:02.500 --> 06:05.583
- Where we're goin'
we don't need roads.

06:05.667 --> 06:06.417
- Back to the future!

06:06.500 --> 06:07.041
- Ah, yeah you got it!

06:07.125 --> 06:09.125
I knew you'd get it.

06:09.208 --> 06:10.625
- Yeah, what'd you
think was gonna happen?

06:10.709 --> 06:11.375
- I don't know, I thought
we'd pull up to the

06:11.458 --> 06:14.250
campsite and be done with it.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.125
I didn't realize you guys
were gonna be so hardcore.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.291
- So, how far are
we talkin' here

06:17.375 --> 06:20.125
because all this gear
doesn't exactly look light.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.417
- [Jess] Well we can take
turns carrying the heavy stuff.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.792
- Okay, that's great
but how far is it?

06:24.875 --> 06:28.250
- It's like, what
would you guesstimate?

06:29.375 --> 06:31.291
- I don't know, maybe
three, four miles at most.

06:31.375 --> 06:34.291
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

06:34.375 --> 06:35.041
- Do you two even
know where we're goin?

06:35.125 --> 06:36.250
- Oh, ye of little faith.

06:36.333 --> 06:37.458
- Remember I've been on your
little excursions before.

06:37.542 --> 06:39.417
- And I have never
gotten us lost.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.959
- I can bring up
specific examples.

06:41.041 --> 06:43.291
- Yeah, bite me.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.083
Morning, sunshine.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.000
- Are we there yet?

06:48.083 --> 06:49.333
- [Aubrey] No such luck.

06:49.417 --> 06:50.166
- Bummer.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.625
- Yeah, so would you mind?

06:52.709 --> 06:54.000
Are you serious?

06:58.417 --> 06:59.583
- I'm ready.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.542
- Damn, you really do smoke
a lot of weed, you know that?

07:02.625 --> 07:04.417
- More than some,
less than others.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.333
Perspective's an
interesting concept.

07:06.417 --> 07:07.625
- Yeah, I don't know about that.

07:07.709 --> 07:09.834
But I've known some
burn outs in my day

07:09.917 --> 07:11.166
and I'm pretty sure you can
smoke them all under the table.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.250
- Well, keep in mind,
I don't normally

07:12.333 --> 07:13.709
blaze up this much.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.375
It just so happens
to be a holiday.

07:15.458 --> 07:16.709
- A holiday?

07:16.792 --> 07:18.333
You Jewish or something?

07:18.417 --> 07:20.083
(laughing)

07:20.166 --> 07:23.417
- I'm pretty sure she's
talking about 420.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.625
- That's right. (laughing)

07:25.709 --> 07:26.917
- Thanks for the help, guys.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.792
- Sorry.
- Sorry, Aubrey.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.208
- [Aubrey] So, check it out,

07:30.291 --> 07:32.166
I really want to get there
before we lose anymore daylight.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.333
- [Rachel] Let's go, I've
been waitin' on your asses.

07:33.417 --> 07:34.667
- [Donna] Let's do this.

07:34.750 --> 07:36.375
- Does everybody have
everything they need?

07:36.458 --> 07:40.542
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.834
Alright, let's blow
this Popsicle stand.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.917
- [Donna] Woo,
Popsicles sound good!

07:45.000 --> 07:47.583
(upbeat music)

07:58.375 --> 08:01.291
(women chattering)

08:07.500 --> 08:10.542
- Ah, what we will do for booze.

08:10.625 --> 08:11.917
- I know, right.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.834
You sure this is the right way?

08:15.917 --> 08:18.542
- Yes, you keep asking me that.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.583
I know it's gorgeous, isn't it?

08:23.667 --> 08:25.750
- I can't wait to
get in bed, though.

08:25.834 --> 08:26.834
- We're almost there.

08:26.917 --> 08:30.792
(ominous breathing)
(laughing)

08:33.000 --> 08:35.417
- I am telling you
about this place.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.166
Super creepy.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.958
It's like a spooktacular
horror movie.

08:39.041 --> 08:42.082
Oh, you know the one where the
campers take the wrong turn

08:42.166 --> 08:43.375
and then they get hacked up by--

08:43.457 --> 08:46.583
- Can we talk about
something else, please?

08:46.667 --> 08:49.041
It's bad enough we're thousands
of miles from civilization,

08:49.125 --> 08:51.375
I don't need you putting
anymore ideas in my head.

08:51.458 --> 08:54.667
- Don't trip, we're not
that far off the grid.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.458
- Famous last words.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.625
So, what's you're deal?

09:00.709 --> 09:03.458
You rent out half of
Jess's duplex or something?

09:03.542 --> 09:08.125
- Yeah, I met her after
college, after I graduated.

09:08.208 --> 09:11.250
I was couch surfing and
you could kind of say

09:11.333 --> 09:11.792
she adopted me.

09:15.083 --> 09:17.208
So, who are you here with?

09:18.208 --> 09:20.792
- I'm here with Rachel.
- Ah.

09:20.875 --> 09:23.000
- Well, I mean she invited me.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.792
We work together and
she somehow convinced

09:24.875 --> 09:26.834
me to tag along.

09:26.917 --> 09:28.208
She can be very persuasive.

09:28.291 --> 09:29.875
- I bet she can be.

09:32.792 --> 09:35.125
- So that's your latest
conquest I take it?

09:35.208 --> 09:36.083
- Hmm, Oh.

09:37.041 --> 09:40.625
I'd say the jury's
still out but yeah,

09:40.709 --> 09:42.125
I'd say it's lookin' up.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.375
- You are such a
player, you know that?

09:44.458 --> 09:46.166
- Okay, I'm not a
player, I'm a romantic.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.875
- A romantic?
- Yeah.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.166
- Oh is that what they call it?

09:50.250 --> 09:53.792
- Ugh, damn, when you
were little and your
legs were shorter

09:53.875 --> 09:54.709
did it take you a whole
week to get here or what?

09:54.792 --> 09:56.959
- So when you were
younger and your sarcasm

09:57.041 --> 09:58.083
was a little more in check,

09:58.166 --> 10:00.083
were you more
pleasant to be around?

10:00.166 --> 10:02.208
- You know, you're lucky
that Jess here is your girl.

10:02.291 --> 10:03.625
I mean, with all that
trash you're talkin'

10:03.709 --> 10:04.500
I wouldn't want to embarrass you

10:04.583 --> 10:05.875
and have to lay the smack down.

10:05.959 --> 10:07.542
- Shut up.
- Oh, boy.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.208
- Hey, I thought you said
we couldn't drive out here.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.625
- I did, we still can't.

10:11.709 --> 10:13.291
- Well, what makes
them so special?

10:13.375 --> 10:16.000
(ominous music)

10:16.083 --> 10:18.709
- Shit, shit, shit,
it's the fuzz!

10:18.792 --> 10:21.583
- No, actually it's
just the forest ranger.

10:21.667 --> 10:24.625
- Oh my God
- Okay, he's stopping.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.792
- What are you girls
doing out here?

10:26.875 --> 10:28.000
Are you lost?

10:28.083 --> 10:30.250
- No, we're just on our
way up to Higgins Creek.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.250
- Right.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.625
- Yeah, we're gonna camp
there for the weekend.

10:33.709 --> 10:35.333
- All five of you are out
here by your lonesome, huh?

10:35.417 --> 10:37.458
- Is that a problem?

10:37.542 --> 10:40.166
- No, just feel a
whole lot better if you

10:40.250 --> 10:41.375
weren't out here by yourself.

10:41.458 --> 10:42.875
- I'm sorry, what was
your name officer?

10:42.959 --> 10:44.667
- Officer. (laughs)

10:44.750 --> 10:47.125
What do you take me
for, being a pig?

10:47.208 --> 10:48.917
- No, I'm sorry, sir, it's
just you have the bad--

10:49.000 --> 10:50.583
- Sir; that's even
worse, call me Rick.

10:50.667 --> 10:54.667
Ranger Rick.
- Hi, ranger Rick.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.208
(snorting)

10:57.291 --> 10:57.959
- Is something funny?

10:58.041 --> 11:01.125
- No (clears throat) sir, Mr.--

11:01.208 --> 11:01.834
(laughing under breath)

11:01.917 --> 11:04.125
Mr. Rick.
- Ranger Rick.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.375
- Yeah, I'll take
your word for it.

11:05.458 --> 11:06.875
(snickering)

11:06.959 --> 11:09.834
- So, you ladies out here
to give me some trouble?

11:09.917 --> 11:11.291
- Oh, no, we're just,

11:11.375 --> 11:14.083
we're just camping for
my best friends birthday.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.625
- Oh, thanks for that.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.542
- Oh, it's your birthday, huh?

11:16.625 --> 11:18.083
- That's what they tell me.

11:18.166 --> 11:19.709
- Well, I guess I can't
stop you from going ahead

11:19.792 --> 11:20.375
and doing what you want to do.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.709
- Yeah, that's right.

11:22.792 --> 11:24.333
- But, I would be
remiss if I didn't

11:24.417 --> 11:26.125
give you some
sound advice before

11:26.208 --> 11:28.834
you skip on your merry way.

11:28.917 --> 11:33.000
(ranger sighs)
(ominous music)

11:33.083 --> 11:38.125
Would you happen to have a beer
down there in the ice chest?

11:47.208 --> 11:49.291
Ah, thank you.

11:52.041 --> 11:53.375
(can top pops)
Whoa.

11:53.458 --> 11:55.583
(chuckles) Cheers.

11:55.667 --> 11:59.250
Oh, nothing like a cold
one, I swear to God.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.834
Oh, God that's the ticket.

12:03.917 --> 12:07.333
(burps) Pardon me.

12:07.417 --> 12:08.458
Alright now, where were we?

12:08.542 --> 12:09.041
Oh yeah, listen.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.542
I want you to stay on
the trails, alright?

12:12.625 --> 12:15.333
Use the designated
camping spots,

12:15.417 --> 12:17.333
read all the signs
that are posted

12:17.417 --> 12:21.834
and most importantly, you
stay out of them damn hills.

12:22.834 --> 12:23.875
Or else.
- Or else what?

12:23.959 --> 12:27.417
- We have an issue up here
with guerrilla growers.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.125
- Nice!

12:29.208 --> 12:30.458
- Guerrilla growers?
- Mm-hmm.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.333
- What are those?
- Pot farmers.

12:32.417 --> 12:34.875
- This whole area is
perfect conditions

12:34.959 --> 12:37.083
for growing that
shit, apparently.

12:37.166 --> 12:42.166
A lot of nooks and crevices
they hide the stuff in.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.083
D.A. boys do everything they can

12:43.166 --> 12:47.291
but it's a real
exercise in futility.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.834
Take down one farm, another
one just pops right up.

12:49.917 --> 12:50.917
It's like clock work.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.458
- Come on, man.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.500
What are a bunch of old
hippie farts gonna do to us?

12:54.583 --> 12:56.834
- Now, that's where
you're mistaken.

12:56.917 --> 12:59.208
These aren't some stoned out,

12:59.291 --> 13:01.834
pass-me-the-doobie,
hippie types.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.792
These are cold blooded
gangsters running a business

13:04.875 --> 13:05.834
and the crops are the investment

13:05.917 --> 13:10.333
and they'll protect that
investment at all costs

13:10.417 --> 13:13.208
up to and even
including violence.

13:14.166 --> 13:15.041
- Are you serious?

13:15.125 --> 13:16.875
- Like a heart attack.

13:16.959 --> 13:21.083
We had some campers missing
a couple of days ago.

13:21.166 --> 13:22.792
We searched and
couldn't find anything,

13:22.875 --> 13:25.917
maybe they fell off a cliff,
maybe mauled by a bear.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.875
But my suspicion is: they got
their snouts into something

13:29.959 --> 13:32.208
they shouldn't have and now
they're buried in a shallow

13:32.291 --> 13:35.959
grave right up there in
those hills, rotting away.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.291
It would really break my heart

13:38.375 --> 13:40.792
if anything happened
to you girls.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.709
Alright, so please
just stay on the trail,

13:42.792 --> 13:45.750
read all the signs
that are posted,

13:45.834 --> 13:49.208
and for God sake, stay
out of those hills.

13:49.542 --> 13:50.083
Okay?

13:51.834 --> 13:53.709
You understand right?

13:57.500 --> 13:58.667
You understand?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.166
- [Women] Yes, sir.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.750
- Alright, Higgins Creek, right?

14:02.834 --> 14:05.750
Alright down here
a couple of licks,

14:05.834 --> 14:07.875
go to the fork in the,

14:07.959 --> 14:09.333
listen, do you have a map?

14:09.417 --> 14:10.917
- Oh, no.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
- No, well that instills a
great deal of confidence in me.

14:15.083 --> 14:15.875
- Well we've been going
there since we were kids

14:15.959 --> 14:18.041
so we know--
- Yeah, just the same,

14:18.125 --> 14:21.625
I'd feel a whole lot
better if you'd take this.

14:21.709 --> 14:22.959
Am I right?

14:23.041 --> 14:26.000
Here, this is my
birthday present for you.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.959
- Thanks.
- Okay.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.750
Alright ladies, be on your
way before I change my mind.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.083
- Yeah, don't mention it.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.792
(truck engine revving)

14:46.458 --> 14:49.291
(peaceful music)

15:10.083 --> 15:12.125
(women chattering)

15:28.417 --> 15:30.959
- How long is it gonna
take to get to this place?

15:31.041 --> 15:32.667
- (sighs) I know, I feel like
we've been walking forever.

15:32.750 --> 15:35.125
- This is some bullshit!

15:35.208 --> 15:36.625
- Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch,

15:36.709 --> 15:38.583
you guys, I'm getting really
tired of all the complaining.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.792
I've told you,
we'll be there soon.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.250
- Yeah, well that's the problem.

15:42.333 --> 15:46.333
You keep saying that but soon
never seems to get there.

15:46.417 --> 15:47.583
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.709
- It's not about feeling
a damn way, it's a fact.

15:49.792 --> 15:52.625
- Look, what do you
want me to do about it?

15:52.709 --> 15:53.792
- Jess, do you know if
this is the right way

15:53.875 --> 15:56.000
or you're just going along
with what Aubrey's saying?

15:56.083 --> 15:57.125
And be honest.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.208
- Well (sighs),

16:01.291 --> 16:03.542
I mean, it does seem
to be taking a while.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.041
But, I do recognize all of this.

16:05.125 --> 16:09.208
- Yeah but do you remember it
taking this long to get there?

16:09.291 --> 16:11.750
We should've been
there by now, right?

16:11.834 --> 16:12.667
- It kinda feels that way.
- I fucking knew it.

16:12.750 --> 16:14.959
Where's the damn map?

16:15.041 --> 16:16.792
- Look, for your information,
I remember just fine

16:16.875 --> 16:20.166
and we're going the right way.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.667
Give her the map.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.583
- I may have sweated
on it a little.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.917
- Ugh, what did he
do with this thing?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.083
- You probably
don't want to know.

16:29.166 --> 16:31.625
- I can't make heads
or tails of this.

16:31.709 --> 16:32.583
- Here.

16:35.291 --> 16:39.166
So we started here and
we want to go here.

16:39.250 --> 16:40.083
- Okay, I got it.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.083
So where's that put us now?

16:42.166 --> 16:43.208
- That's a good question.

16:43.291 --> 16:44.750
- You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.041
(ominous music)
(loud banging)

16:46.125 --> 16:47.417
(women gasping)

16:47.500 --> 16:48.125
- What the hell was that?
(leaves crunching)

16:48.208 --> 16:49.792
- Where is that coming from?

16:49.875 --> 16:50.500
- [Donna] It's
probably just a animal.

16:50.583 --> 16:51.208
- Think it's in front of us.

16:51.291 --> 16:53.041
- [Michelle] Should we run?

16:53.125 --> 16:55.625
- No, no, we don't
want to do that.

16:55.709 --> 16:56.875
- What if it's a bear?

16:56.959 --> 16:58.083
- Or a Saskwatch?

16:58.166 --> 16:59.458
- This isn't funny!
- Who's laughing?

16:59.542 --> 17:00.542
- I say we make a run for it.

17:00.625 --> 17:01.417
- No, what if we do and
Big Foot or whatever

17:01.500 --> 17:02.667
freaks out and
starts charging us?

17:02.750 --> 17:04.834
- I thought that saskwatches
were supposed to avoid people?

17:04.916 --> 17:06.333
- I don't know what they do.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.583
But do you really want to
roll the dice and find out?

17:08.666 --> 17:13.709
(suspenseful music)
- Everyone stand behind me.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.583
- I don't hear anything anymore.

17:19.666 --> 17:21.125
- I don't either.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.250
Do you think it went away?

17:22.333 --> 17:23.458
- I think so.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.458
(suspenseful music)
(women screaming)

17:25.541 --> 17:26.500
- Help!

17:26.583 --> 17:27.625
Help me! Help me!

17:27.709 --> 17:29.625
- Hey, buddy,
what's your problem?

17:29.709 --> 17:31.125
- How'd you know my name?

17:31.208 --> 17:32.250
- What?

17:32.333 --> 17:33.458
- Stay away from me.

17:33.542 --> 17:34.000
- You're the one that's
trippin' out on us, man.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.000
- Stay away from me!

17:36.083 --> 17:37.959
Stay away!
- Okay, that was fun.

17:38.041 --> 17:39.208
Can we go now?

17:39.291 --> 17:40.792
- Yeah, good idea.

17:49.000 --> 17:49.500
- [Donna] Come on.

17:49.583 --> 17:51.625
Jess.

17:51.709 --> 17:52.208
- Jess, come on.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.834
- It's okay, it's
alright, I got this.

17:55.917 --> 17:56.750
- Screw that, look at him!

17:56.834 --> 17:59.041
He's clearly looney toons.

17:59.125 --> 18:02.458
(buddy whimpering)
- Hey, buddy.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.625
Buddy, is that your name?

18:04.709 --> 18:05.917
- That's what people call me.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.917
- They call you Buddy?

18:08.917 --> 18:10.291
Well that's kind of funny.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.500
Why do people call you that?

18:14.583 --> 18:16.000
- Because I'm everybody's buddy.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.583
Wanna know something?
- Hmm?

18:18.667 --> 18:19.667
- Dug was my buddy.

18:19.750 --> 18:20.625
- Oh.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.667
- He's dead now.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.083
He was my bestest buddy
in the whole world

18:26.166 --> 18:26.917
and now he's dead!

18:27.000 --> 18:30.625
And now Dug is
dead! (whimpering)

18:30.709 --> 18:32.458
- Hey, hey.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.166
I'm really sorry to hear that.

18:36.917 --> 18:40.250
Can you tell me what happened?

18:41.250 --> 18:43.166
- It happened out there.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.291
In the forest.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.875
Dug saw him first.

18:47.959 --> 18:51.834
It was a monster or a
demon and he was hunting us

18:53.041 --> 18:55.417
and we were the
prey and it got Dug.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.375
It got Dug and now
it's coming for me.

18:57.458 --> 18:58.917
It's coming for me!

18:59.000 --> 18:59.709
- Stay with me, here.

18:59.792 --> 19:01.375
Stay with me, okay?

19:02.959 --> 19:06.333
Buddy, why would someone
want to kill you?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.333
- The weed.

19:13.208 --> 19:16.041
- Did he just say the weed?

19:16.125 --> 19:17.875
(gasping)
- Whoa.

19:17.959 --> 19:19.291
- Holy crapballs!

19:20.875 --> 19:23.250
- Take it.
- Yeah, Jess, Jess,

19:23.333 --> 19:24.500
oblige the guy.
- No, no, no.

19:24.583 --> 19:25.083
You heard what Ranger Rick said.

19:25.166 --> 19:27.250
What if he stole that?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.750
- That's his problem, that's
got nothing to do with us.

19:29.834 --> 19:34.166
You know like, like, like
finders keepers and shit!

19:35.166 --> 19:35.792
- Take it, take it,
take it, please take it!

19:35.875 --> 19:38.083
Please, please!

19:38.959 --> 19:41.291
Now it's your weed.

19:42.166 --> 19:43.625
And that means you're next.

19:43.709 --> 19:46.000
You're all next.

19:47.875 --> 19:48.417
You're all next!

19:50.333 --> 19:52.333
- What a weirdo.
- Whoa.

19:52.417 --> 19:55.583
- Fuck yeah, that
weirdo hooked it up!

19:57.333 --> 20:00.959
(sighs excitedly) That is a
thing of beauty right there.

20:01.041 --> 20:04.333
There's gotta be at
least like a (laughing)

20:04.417 --> 20:08.709
there's a butt load
of weed in this bag!

20:08.792 --> 20:10.917
- Wow, yep, that's
a lot of weed.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.250
(mumbling excitedly)

20:16.917 --> 20:18.166
- Guys, guys!

20:19.375 --> 20:20.834
We need to go find Ranger
Rick and tell him about this.

20:20.917 --> 20:22.125
- What?
- Come on, Jess.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.083
Are you really that gullible?

20:24.166 --> 20:25.583
- Hey, you heard the guy.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.291
There could be a dead or
a dying person out there.

20:27.375 --> 20:28.625
- Okay, I heard him
but he wasn't exactly

20:28.709 --> 20:30.792
firing off on all
cylinders, now was he?

20:30.875 --> 20:33.875
- Yeah, that dude was fucked
up on some gnarly mushrooms

20:33.959 --> 20:36.125
or something.
- Yeah, exactly.

20:36.208 --> 20:37.750
So whatever his deal was or is,

20:37.834 --> 20:39.458
I say let it not
ruin our weekend.

20:39.542 --> 20:43.875
That is if you can ever
figure out where we're going.

20:43.959 --> 20:46.333
- Like I said, we're here.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.000
And if we just take
the fork up the hill,

20:48.083 --> 20:51.250
we'll be right there.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.291
- Uh-huh.

20:52.375 --> 20:53.625
(laughing)

20:53.709 --> 20:54.625
- So you guys wanna
go or you wanna

20:54.709 --> 20:55.750
stand around here all day?

20:55.834 --> 20:59.291
- It's your show, Ace.
- Thank you.

20:59.375 --> 21:00.709
- Congratulations.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.250
(ominous music)

21:04.333 --> 21:07.667
- Hey, Jess, you comin?
- Yeah.

21:15.083 --> 21:18.959
(suspenseful music)

21:53.792 --> 21:56.709
(crying)

22:05.542 --> 22:08.500
(crying and yelling)

22:14.125 --> 22:15.208
(woman laughing)
- Does anyone know

22:15.291 --> 22:16.166
any good Dead Baby Jokes?

22:16.250 --> 22:17.625
- Oh my God!
(laughing)

22:17.709 --> 22:21.083
- [Donna] Have any of you guys
ever had sex while camping?

22:21.166 --> 22:22.709
- Not yet.
- No.

22:22.792 --> 22:25.959
- Well, trust me, it's intense.

22:26.041 --> 22:28.250
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.
(laughing)

22:28.333 --> 22:30.166
- Okay, what about this one?

22:30.250 --> 22:32.333
What do you get when the
mafia crosses the road?

22:32.417 --> 22:33.458
- What?

22:33.542 --> 22:36.166
- Forget about it, huh?

22:36.250 --> 22:37.125
- Ha, ha!

22:38.333 --> 22:38.959
- Okay, what do you get
whenever you cross a-

22:39.041 --> 22:40.750
- Okay, I vote no more, please

22:40.834 --> 22:41.750
- Yeah, no more.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.625
- But this one's really good.

22:43.709 --> 22:45.583
(gunshot blasting)

22:45.667 --> 22:47.667
Whoa, is that what
I think it is?

22:47.750 --> 22:49.250
(gunshot blasting)

22:49.333 --> 22:50.709
- Where the hell
have you taken me?

22:50.792 --> 22:51.417
- Hey, stop shooting!

22:51.500 --> 22:53.166
There are people over here!

22:53.250 --> 22:55.417
- Hey, did y'all see that?

22:55.500 --> 22:58.667
That's a quick little
bastard, isn't he?

22:58.750 --> 23:00.625
Man, did y'all see where
that jack rabbit went?

23:00.709 --> 23:04.291
- No and don't you know it's
illegal to hunt out here?

23:04.375 --> 23:05.166
- Don't you worry, honey.

23:05.250 --> 23:06.291
This here is just some buckshot.

23:06.375 --> 23:07.458
- Well in that case.

23:07.542 --> 23:09.166
- Yeah, you could've
killed someone!

23:09.250 --> 23:12.625
- Oh my gosh, I'm
terribly sorry ladies.

23:12.709 --> 23:14.875
Any you broads get hit?
- Luckily, no.

23:14.959 --> 23:17.458
- Okay, then, I guess we
got nothing left to discuss.

23:17.542 --> 23:18.625
- Yeah we do.

23:18.709 --> 23:20.208
Bet it makes you feel
like a real tough guy,

23:20.291 --> 23:21.583
killing and torturing
little animals, huh?

23:21.667 --> 23:24.458
- Can we not do this?
- Why, fuck that guy!

23:24.542 --> 23:25.875
- You got something
you wanna say to me?

23:25.959 --> 23:26.834
- Yeah, plenty.

23:26.917 --> 23:28.875
And if you weren't
lugging around that piece

23:28.959 --> 23:30.792
of male compensation I would
tell you how I really feel.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.125
- What are you, one of
them big city libtards,

23:32.208 --> 23:34.583
who don't believe in freedom?

23:34.667 --> 23:35.959
- Oh no, on the contrary, I
believe you can do whatever the

23:36.041 --> 23:38.000
hell you want as long as you
don't behave like an asshole.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.000
- Let me tell you something,
as long as I got my rights,

23:41.083 --> 23:43.875
I'm going to exercise them,
whether you like it or not.

23:43.959 --> 23:45.166
- Yeah, what about
our right not to die?

23:45.250 --> 23:47.750
- Well that all depends.

23:47.834 --> 23:49.500
You armed?
- Obviously, no.

23:49.583 --> 23:52.291
- Well if you had
any sense, you would.

23:52.375 --> 23:54.333
Trust me, get your ass a gun.

23:54.417 --> 23:56.875
Legally or illegally,
it don't matter.

23:56.959 --> 23:59.500
Because the government,
nor the police,

23:59.583 --> 24:02.625
nor your daddy, nor no
one is gon protect you.

24:05.500 --> 24:09.333
- You need to like get high
and chillax are something.

24:09.417 --> 24:09.625
Here, here...

24:14.625 --> 24:16.667
My gift to you.
- What are you,

24:16.750 --> 24:19.792
the weed fairy?
- Yeah, why not?

24:19.875 --> 24:21.041
You must give to
receive, as they say.

24:21.125 --> 24:21.959
- What you got here?

24:22.041 --> 24:24.333
A little reefer?

24:25.041 --> 24:27.333
- Just take it, it's yours.

24:27.417 --> 24:28.792
Just do us a favor,

24:28.875 --> 24:32.542
just stop hunting and
shooting and stuff, alright?

24:32.625 --> 24:36.542
It's 420, you shouldn't go out
of your way to kill things.

24:36.625 --> 24:39.000
You got something
to smoke that with?

24:39.083 --> 24:40.375
- Yeah, got me a lighter.

24:40.458 --> 24:41.542
- Alright.

24:41.625 --> 24:43.625
Oh, hell yeah, you're
all set right there.

24:43.709 --> 24:45.125
You can just like
roll that shit up

24:45.208 --> 24:47.875
and smoke that blunt like a G.

24:47.959 --> 24:48.458
- Like a what now?

24:48.542 --> 24:51.125
- Nevermind, you just...

24:52.166 --> 24:54.333
Take a cigar and you're
gonna split it right down

24:54.417 --> 24:56.291
the middle, hollow
out the tobacco,

24:56.375 --> 24:57.709
when you're left with
all the paper stuff,

24:57.792 --> 25:00.792
just roll it on up like a
joint, you're good to go.

25:00.875 --> 25:04.083
- Hmm, alright, much obliged.

25:04.166 --> 25:05.375
- Just remember our deal.

25:05.458 --> 25:07.792
Puff, puff don't bang, bang.

25:12.750 --> 25:15.166
And that's how you
resolve conflict.

25:15.250 --> 25:17.417
- Yeah it's great.

25:17.500 --> 25:18.417
Now we got some nut
job carrying a gun,

25:18.500 --> 25:20.250
high out of his mind
wandering around here.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.750
You totally made us safe.

25:22.834 --> 25:24.083
- Aw, weed doesn't
work that way.

25:24.166 --> 25:26.750
He's gonna smoke it
and not wanna do shit.

25:26.834 --> 25:29.875
(lighthearted music)

25:38.166 --> 25:42.125
(lighthearted music)

25:50.166 --> 25:53.166
(women chattering)

25:57.500 --> 25:58.583
- Yes, I do.

26:02.208 --> 26:02.750
Ugh, oh my gosh.

26:09.709 --> 26:10.792
- Yes, please.

26:12.208 --> 26:15.333
(laughing)

26:17.041 --> 26:18.834
Oh, this feels so good.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.875
It's so quiet out here.

26:27.959 --> 26:28.834
It's kinda nice, actually.

26:28.917 --> 26:30.792
- I think that's the
first positive thing

26:30.875 --> 26:31.500
you've said since we got here.

26:31.583 --> 26:34.000
- Oh, come on.
(laughing)

26:34.083 --> 26:35.542
I haven't been
complaining that much.

26:35.625 --> 26:37.583
And you have to admit,
that hike was ridiculous.

26:37.667 --> 26:39.417
- Sure, I was just
scared you were gonna

26:39.500 --> 26:41.000
have regrets about coming.

26:41.083 --> 26:42.709
- Not yet.

26:44.417 --> 26:47.834
No, I'm actually really
glad you dragged me along.

26:47.917 --> 26:50.000
- See, I knew you'd come around.

26:50.083 --> 26:53.333
Now imagine once we bust out
the sleeping bags and we just

26:53.417 --> 26:56.041
lay here all night with
the stars above our head.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.041
- Are you high?

26:57.125 --> 26:58.041
I'm not sleepin' outside.

26:58.125 --> 27:00.792
That's what we brought
the tent for, right?

27:00.875 --> 27:02.667
- You have no
sense of adventure.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.667
(fly buzzing)

27:04.750 --> 27:08.166
Ugh, this bug needs
to get away from me.

27:09.125 --> 27:11.000
- Alright ladies,
I'd love to sit here

27:11.083 --> 27:12.667
and recharge my batteries
with the rest of you guys

27:12.750 --> 27:14.959
but we have to set up
camp and I'm sure as hell

27:15.041 --> 27:16.291
not gonna do it by myself.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.875
- You're such a slave driver.
- I know.

27:18.959 --> 27:20.375
It's just as soon as we
get this off our shoulders,

27:20.458 --> 27:22.041
the sooner we can party.

27:22.125 --> 27:23.333
- Amen to that!

27:23.959 --> 27:25.792
But can we eat first?

27:25.875 --> 27:26.709
Seriously, I'm starving.

27:26.792 --> 27:29.083
I'm so hungry I
could eat a horse.

27:29.166 --> 27:31.041
- How bout some lips and
assholes instead, huh?

27:31.125 --> 27:31.375
- That's disgusting.

27:31.458 --> 27:33.125
- Yummy.

27:33.208 --> 27:34.500
- So, you guys set the tent up

27:34.583 --> 27:35.750
and I'll grill these puppies up.

27:35.834 --> 27:37.125
What do you say?

27:37.208 --> 27:39.333
- It works for me.
- Cool.

27:40.166 --> 27:43.208
- Does anyone want a beer?
- Yes!

27:48.125 --> 27:50.750
(upbeat music)

27:53.250 --> 27:55.875
- So, I think this
thing goes up.

27:57.083 --> 27:58.041
- Oh yeah, it looks
like they're supposed

27:58.125 --> 28:00.583
to get into each other.
- Okay.

28:00.667 --> 28:02.625
- Oh, yeah here it is.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.291
- One step done.

28:06.041 --> 28:06.917
- Okay, I got it.
- Oh, you do?

28:07.000 --> 28:10.333
- Yes, okay, so snap
all these things on

28:10.417 --> 28:11.792
and then go to the bottom.

28:15.709 --> 28:18.041
- Hey, you did it, good job.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.792
- Yay you figured it out!

How's the dogs?

28:54.291 --> 28:56.625
- I think it's gonna be
another minute or two.

28:56.709 --> 28:58.291
What I actually meant
is how is that goin?

28:58.375 --> 28:59.500
- We practically
grew up together.

28:59.583 --> 29:00.959
- So?

29:01.041 --> 29:04.083
- So, I don't wanna
screw that up.

29:04.166 --> 29:07.458
Plus, I never really
told her anything.

29:10.625 --> 29:11.458
So I just wanna make sure
she has a good birthday.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.500
Period, end of story.

29:14.583 --> 29:16.000
- Well if you ask me, I
think you should make like

29:16.083 --> 29:17.625
Young MC and bust a move.

29:17.709 --> 29:21.291
- I'll keep that
in mind, thanks.

29:21.375 --> 29:21.917
- Oh shit, can you
grab me that plate?

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
It's burning on the side.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.834
- I can't wait to blaze you up.

29:26.917 --> 29:27.500
- I'm surprised you
haven't done it already.

29:27.583 --> 29:29.792
- Oh, it's coming.

29:29.875 --> 29:31.542
I'm just waiting
for the right time.

29:31.625 --> 29:33.917
- What's the right time?
- 4:20, of course.

29:34.000 --> 29:34.959
- Oh, right, of course.

29:35.041 --> 29:36.583
- I just think it's a
crying shame that you

29:36.667 --> 29:39.625
are not going to partake.

29:39.709 --> 29:40.458
- Hey, I don't mind pot.

29:40.542 --> 29:43.959
It's just never been my jam.

29:44.041 --> 29:47.667
You know, I've tried it and
got really really paranoid.

29:47.750 --> 29:51.500
Then I just spaced
out and passed out.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.875
Just not fun for me.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.458
But I don't care
if you guys do it.

29:55.542 --> 29:56.583
Go ahead.

29:56.667 --> 29:57.542
Smoke, be happy.

29:57.625 --> 29:58.583
- Yeah but that's the thing.

29:58.667 --> 30:01.000
Your birthday is on 4-20.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.000
You do realize that right?
- No.

30:03.083 --> 30:03.834
(laughing)

30:03.917 --> 30:05.917
- So what do you do instead?

30:06.000 --> 30:06.709
You reject it?

30:06.792 --> 30:07.792
- Reject what?

30:07.875 --> 30:08.917
- Your destiny.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.625
- If the opportunity
presented itself, maybe.

30:11.709 --> 30:15.625
But, even then I don't
know what I'd do or say.

30:16.792 --> 30:17.709
- Okay, you know this
might sound crazy,

30:17.792 --> 30:19.375
but you should just
tell her how you feel.

30:19.458 --> 30:21.041
- Just tell her.
- No, the fuckin' Easter Bunny

30:21.125 --> 30:21.625
Yes, tell Jess.

30:21.709 --> 30:23.750
Don't be ridiculous.

30:23.834 --> 30:25.375
- Do I look like I
need love advice?

30:25.458 --> 30:27.125
- (laughs) Frankly, yes.

30:27.208 --> 30:28.375
I mean from my vantage point,

30:28.458 --> 30:29.583
you look like a
scared little girl

30:29.667 --> 30:30.542
that's willing to
wait on the sidelines

30:30.625 --> 30:32.375
and watch the parade
of life pass her by.

30:32.458 --> 30:33.333
- That's a little harsh.

30:33.417 --> 30:34.583
- Well the truth
can be that way.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.166
- All I'm saying is,
with all the bad shit

30:36.250 --> 30:38.750
that's happened on 4-20,
we need a person like you

30:38.834 --> 30:41.792
smoking out to keep
things balanced.

30:41.875 --> 30:42.583
- Wait, I'm lost.

30:42.667 --> 30:44.458
Why is 4-20 a bad day?

30:44.542 --> 30:45.458
- Lot's of reasons.

30:45.542 --> 30:46.750
I mean, you do know
what historical figure

30:46.834 --> 30:48.458
was born on this
very day, right?

30:48.542 --> 30:49.834
I assume you know.

30:49.917 --> 30:52.250
- Oh, no I never
heard that before.

30:52.333 --> 30:54.750
- Well then don't say anything.

30:54.834 --> 30:56.542
Would you care to
venture a guess?

30:56.625 --> 30:58.834
- Hmm, Bob Marley?

30:58.917 --> 31:00.083
- No, that's an urban legend.

31:00.166 --> 31:02.000
No, it wasn't Jim
Morrison either.

31:02.083 --> 31:06.000
- Try to think of someone
a little more genocidey.

31:06.083 --> 31:06.959
- I don't know, I give up.

31:07.041 --> 31:07.917
- Adolf Hitler?
- Wow!

31:08.000 --> 31:10.417
You share a birthday
with Hitler, really?

31:10.500 --> 31:12.083
- Mm-hm, sucks right?

31:13.667 --> 31:14.750
- There's a bunch of
other jacked up shit

31:14.834 --> 31:15.959
that's happened on 420.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.917
Which is why it's
our collective duty

31:19.000 --> 31:20.834
to blaze up on this day.

31:20.917 --> 31:23.625
- What in God's name
are you talkin' about?

31:23.709 --> 31:25.625
- I don't know if she'd
go for someone like me.

31:25.709 --> 31:26.792
- Look, it's gonna
come down to this,

31:26.875 --> 31:29.667
you're gonna have to ask
yourself one simple question.

31:29.750 --> 31:31.125
How badly do you want it?

31:31.208 --> 31:32.291
- What do you mean?

31:32.375 --> 31:34.125
- I mean, how bad do
you want to be with her?

31:34.208 --> 31:36.125
- There's nothing more that
I want in this whole world.

31:36.208 --> 31:38.125
- Okay well then you have it.

31:38.208 --> 31:41.125
Because anyone can get
anything and I mean anything,

31:41.208 --> 31:42.625
provided they want
it badly enough.

31:42.709 --> 31:45.333
- What if I tell her how I feel

31:45.417 --> 31:48.250
and she looks at me like
I'm some kind of freak?

31:48.333 --> 31:50.166
- Look, if she shoots you down

31:50.250 --> 31:52.458
and is too stupid to realize
what a good person you are

31:52.542 --> 31:55.291
then she isn't
worth it, trust me.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.667
- That's nice.
- It's true.

32:00.750 --> 32:04.208
- Okay, no offense, but
I think you may have

32:04.291 --> 32:06.333
officially smoked
yourself retarded.

32:06.417 --> 32:08.125
(laughing)

32:08.208 --> 32:13.500
- (chuckling sarcastically)
The lists don't lie, okay?

32:13.583 --> 32:16.500
April 20, 1961, the
Bay of Pigs fiasco.

32:16.583 --> 32:18.667
Huge foreign policy blunder.

32:18.750 --> 32:22.000
April 20, 1993, the Waco Siege.

32:22.083 --> 32:24.166
Lots of people killed
and burned alive.

32:24.250 --> 32:27.458
April 20, 1995,
Oklahoma City Bombing.

32:28.625 --> 32:30.834
Worse attack on US soil
since Pearl Harbor.

32:30.917 --> 32:33.792
April 20, 1999 was the
Columbine High School massacre.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.750
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

32:35.834 --> 32:37.875
are you trying to depress
me on my birthday?

32:37.959 --> 32:39.166
- Fine, I will stop there.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.542
But if you dig deeper you're
gonna find a lot more shit,

32:41.625 --> 32:44.125
I can promise you.

32:44.208 --> 32:45.667
That shit's mind
blowing isn't it?

32:45.750 --> 32:47.375
- Sure but what does that
have to do with people

32:47.458 --> 32:48.417
getting high on 4-20?

32:48.500 --> 32:52.291
- To ward off all the bad
vibes and evil spirits.

32:52.375 --> 32:53.500
I mean, think about it.

32:53.583 --> 32:55.667
With all those dark
forces bouncing around.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.750
It almost becomes
imperative that people just

32:58.834 --> 33:00.250
chill the fuck out on 4-20.

33:01.792 --> 33:03.750
That makes sense right?

33:03.834 --> 33:06.542
- Yeah.
(laughing)

33:06.625 --> 33:08.041
- Go ahead, laugh it up.

33:08.125 --> 33:09.250
But by me being loaded,
it's like I am personally

33:09.333 --> 33:14.917
shielding you from all the
potential harm that's out there.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.291
- Oh, thank you.

33:18.291 --> 33:19.667
You're our hero.

33:19.750 --> 33:20.959
- Damn right.

33:24.000 --> 33:24.667
- Hey, come on.
- Come on.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.583
- I'm just jokin'!

33:26.667 --> 33:28.583
- (laughs) Is she serious?

33:28.667 --> 33:31.875
- God, she's hardcore
about this shit.

33:32.792 --> 33:36.250
- I know, I'm so hungry.

33:36.333 --> 33:36.709
- I'm hungry.

33:36.792 --> 33:39.417
- Wanna grab it?

33:39.500 --> 33:41.208
- Behold a feast.

33:41.291 --> 33:42.125
(cheering)

33:42.208 --> 33:43.166
- Whoa, she is hungry.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.208
(women chattering)

33:49.625 --> 33:51.625
- Nice.

33:51.709 --> 33:53.709
- Since Ranger Dickhead
drank half our beer,

33:53.792 --> 33:55.083
I thought we'd class
it up with some--

33:55.166 --> 33:57.917
(women cheering)

33:58.000 --> 33:59.750
- Yeah, hotdogs and champagne.

33:59.834 --> 34:05.792
(cork pops)
(women cheering)

34:08.875 --> 34:09.958
- For you.

34:10.041 --> 34:12.000
Okay, a toast to Jess.

34:14.291 --> 34:16.083
I think that we all can
agree that the world

34:16.166 --> 34:19.500
would be a much
more colorful place

34:19.583 --> 34:21.875
if there were more
people like you in it.

34:21.958 --> 34:23.417
- Don't make me cry.

34:23.500 --> 34:26.833
- But I believe that God
must've really broken the mold

34:26.917 --> 34:31.125
when he made you because
you are one-of-a-kind.

34:31.208 --> 34:34.458
So, I say, screw the
rest of the world.

34:34.542 --> 34:37.542
I think we will keep
you for ourselves.

34:37.625 --> 34:38.458
Happy Birthday, Jess.

34:38.542 --> 34:39.708
- [Group] Happy Birthday!

34:39.792 --> 34:41.041
- Love you.

34:41.125 --> 34:46.041
♪ How long til you see we're
not giving into your madness ♪

34:47.041 --> 34:48.333
- This is good.

34:48.417 --> 34:48.917
- It is good, I
could use some more.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.833
- Yep, it hits the spot.

34:50.917 --> 34:53.208
- Oo, me too.
- Yes, please.

34:55.750 --> 34:56.958
- I'm gonna get one
of these dogs now.

34:57.041 --> 34:58.417
(laughing)

35:02.041 --> 35:05.458
Don't act like you didn't know.

35:06.417 --> 35:08.625
(laughing)

35:15.250 --> 35:19.417
(whistling)
(ominous music)

35:53.959 --> 35:57.125
(suspenseful music)

36:11.333 --> 36:14.208
(leaves rustling)

36:26.333 --> 36:31.291
(limb cracking)
(suspenseful music)

36:58.834 --> 37:00.792
- Jesus.

37:00.875 --> 37:02.208
Good Lord.

37:02.291 --> 37:03.750
Yep, mm-hmm, yep.

37:10.083 --> 37:10.959
Damn.

37:13.041 --> 37:14.750
That young lady
(suspenseful music)

37:14.834 --> 37:17.333
knew what she was talking about.

37:30.792 --> 37:33.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:34.375 --> 37:36.917
Can't we just talk about this?

37:38.750 --> 37:39.625
Go for it.

37:46.875 --> 37:48.667
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doin?

37:48.750 --> 37:51.291
(screaming)

37:59.375 --> 38:01.291
- I don't know why I
pictured it somewhere else.

38:01.375 --> 38:02.166
(burping)

38:02.250 --> 38:04.000
- Woo, man that
really hit the spot.

38:04.083 --> 38:07.583
- Yeah, compliments to the chef.

38:09.208 --> 38:10.333
- Thanks guys, I
really appreciate it

38:10.417 --> 38:12.208
but it's kind of hard
to screw up hotdogs.

38:12.291 --> 38:13.667
I mean, you'd
almost have to try.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.959
- Don't sell your,
short change yourself.

38:17.041 --> 38:18.542
(laughing)

38:18.625 --> 38:19.542
Seriously, it was really good.

38:19.625 --> 38:23.417
- Well, the culinary arts
are my life's passion.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.250
- Really?

38:24.333 --> 38:26.250
(laughing)
I had no idea.

38:26.333 --> 38:27.959
- No.
- I'm kidding!

38:29.625 --> 38:31.792
Seriously, you'd be lucky
not to die of food poisoning.

38:31.875 --> 38:32.959
- Thank you.

38:34.125 --> 38:36.792
- So Aubrey told me you
went back to school.

38:36.875 --> 38:38.875
- Mm-hm.

38:38.959 --> 38:40.041
Taking some PhD classes.

38:40.125 --> 38:41.458
- Doing anything for job?

38:41.542 --> 38:44.959
- Mm-hmm I teach self-defense,
couple nights a week.

38:45.041 --> 38:46.875
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

38:46.959 --> 38:48.834
- Like karate and
kung fu and shit?

38:48.917 --> 38:51.875
- Those are different
things but whatever.

38:51.959 --> 38:53.000
- Well are you any good?

38:53.083 --> 38:54.083
- What teaching?

38:54.166 --> 38:55.500
- No, fighting.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.750
- No.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.458
No, I just do it for exercise.

38:58.542 --> 39:01.208
- Oh no, no, no, no, no
she's just being modest.

39:01.291 --> 39:03.166
Jess can throw down.

39:03.250 --> 39:03.959
For real.
- No.

39:04.041 --> 39:04.500
- Yeah right.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.917
- No, I'm serious.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.083
Come on, show her what you got.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.208
- Stop, no.

39:09.917 --> 39:11.250
- I want to see.

39:11.333 --> 39:12.458
I mean, seriously I
don't think you could

39:12.542 --> 39:14.458
actually do something if someone
tried to really hurt you.

39:14.542 --> 39:17.333
- Oh, someone's
talkin' mad shit, yo.

39:17.417 --> 39:18.125
- I mean, come on.

39:18.208 --> 39:19.583
Come on, cupcake.

39:19.667 --> 39:20.709
Come on.

39:20.792 --> 39:24.333
- [Group] Show us, show
us, show us, show us.

39:25.125 --> 39:29.542
(laughing)
(cheering)

39:33.750 --> 39:37.375
- It doesn't work like that
I can't just attack you.

39:37.458 --> 39:38.500
- Well, that's lame what's
the point in knowing

39:38.583 --> 39:40.583
Ninjitsu and shit if you
can't show off a little?

39:40.667 --> 39:41.458
- Look, how bout this?

39:41.542 --> 39:42.792
Rachel you try to restrain her

39:42.875 --> 39:44.458
then you'll see
what she's made of.

39:44.542 --> 39:46.125
- Fine, have it your way.

39:46.208 --> 39:50.291
(thudding)
(laughing)

39:50.375 --> 39:51.500
How'd you do that?

39:51.583 --> 39:52.875
- Just used your,
like a balance,

39:52.959 --> 39:54.542
your momentum against you.

39:54.625 --> 39:55.792
It's pretty easy actually.

39:55.875 --> 39:57.917
- Remind me not to piss you off.

39:58.000 --> 39:58.375
- Let me help.

39:58.458 --> 39:58.750
Are you okay?

39:58.834 --> 39:59.709
- Yeah.

40:01.875 --> 40:04.500
(melancholy country music)

40:08.917 --> 40:10.375
- Goddammit.

40:10.458 --> 40:12.583
(mumbling)

40:23.375 --> 40:26.667
(ominous music)

40:26.750 --> 40:27.792
What the fuck?

40:40.166 --> 40:43.291
(suspenseful music)

40:58.083 --> 41:01.250
(truck engine revving)

41:07.000 --> 41:10.375
- I am officially
switching to water.

41:10.458 --> 41:14.208
(women groaning and booing)

41:15.125 --> 41:18.834
Eh I'm a lightweight,
I'll admit it.

41:18.917 --> 41:20.166
- Oh shit, what time is it?

41:20.250 --> 41:21.208
- Uh, 4:18.

41:21.792 --> 41:23.375
(squealing excitedly)

41:23.458 --> 41:25.542
- Uh-oh, you almost missed it.

41:25.625 --> 41:27.250
- Almost but not quite

41:27.333 --> 41:30.583
and I brought just the thing.
- Oh no what is that?

41:30.667 --> 41:31.875
- You did not bring that.

41:31.959 --> 41:33.417
You carried that
all the way here?

41:33.500 --> 41:35.333
- You should know me by now.

41:35.417 --> 41:39.291
I don't fuck around when
it comes to the ganja.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.792
Time?
- Uh, 4:19.

41:46.166 --> 41:48.250
- Alright, alright, alright.

41:48.333 --> 41:49.542
I'm assuming you're
all in on the session?

41:49.625 --> 41:52.208
- Yeah!
- No, you can count me out.

41:52.291 --> 41:56.083
- That's because you suck but
we already knew that so...

41:56.166 --> 41:57.250
The rest of you
are smoking though,

41:57.333 --> 41:58.792
I don't care what you say.

41:58.875 --> 41:58.917
Coolio.

42:00.333 --> 42:01.125
Who wants greens?

42:01.208 --> 42:02.417
- That's all you.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.083
- I'm gonna take a
hit and pass it around

42:04.166 --> 42:05.583
and we just keep passing.

42:05.667 --> 42:07.542
Everyone has to get a hit in
before the 60 seconds are up,

42:07.625 --> 42:08.208
got it?
- Yeah.

42:08.291 --> 42:09.625
- You're so funny.

42:09.709 --> 42:12.417
I don't know how you
actually managed to survive

42:12.500 --> 42:14.375
as an adult on a
day-to-day basis.

42:14.458 --> 42:17.083
- Hey this is serious business.

42:17.166 --> 42:18.333
- [Jess] Apparently.

42:18.417 --> 42:19.125
- Do we all get it?

42:19.208 --> 42:19.917
Do we understand?

42:20.000 --> 42:20.917
- Yes ma'am.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.083
- Time and count it out.

42:22.166 --> 42:24.375
- Okay 4:19 and 47 seconds.

42:26.208 --> 42:27.792
50 seconds.

42:27.875 --> 42:31.667
10, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two , one.

42:36.208 --> 42:37.792
4:20, go!

42:37.875 --> 42:40.458
(upbeat music)

42:46.208 --> 42:49.208
(women chattering)

42:53.458 --> 42:58.750
(laughing)
(coughing)

43:17.083 --> 43:19.542
(cheering)

43:21.250 --> 43:23.041
(coughing)

43:23.125 --> 43:24.000
- Good job, guys.

43:24.083 --> 43:25.250
Mama's so proud of you.

43:25.333 --> 43:26.750
Not you, but you.

43:28.583 --> 43:31.709
- This stuff's really stone-y.

43:31.792 --> 43:32.959
- Yeah, it's nice and
fresh, that's why.

43:33.041 --> 43:35.875
- So, what do you guys wanna
do for the rest of the day?

43:35.959 --> 43:38.792
- Mm, I don't know,
where's that creek

43:38.875 --> 43:40.500
we've been hearing
so much about?

43:40.583 --> 43:42.208
- Oh, you just walk
straight that way

43:42.291 --> 43:43.458
and you will fall right in.

43:43.542 --> 43:45.667
(laughing)

43:45.750 --> 43:47.458
- We should go skinny dipping.

43:47.542 --> 43:48.542
- Oh, I'm so down.

43:48.625 --> 43:50.041
- Ha, shocking.

43:50.125 --> 43:50.917
You know I'm half joking.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.375
- And I'm half serious.

43:52.458 --> 43:54.250
- I know, that's why I don't
want you to get your hopes up.

43:54.333 --> 43:55.625
- Oh, the thought
never crossed my mind.

43:55.709 --> 43:57.041
- Yeah right.

43:57.125 --> 44:00.000
- But I do have a bottle of
champagne with your name on it.

44:00.083 --> 44:01.208
- Oh my.

44:01.291 --> 44:02.542
- So, what do you say, you down?

44:02.625 --> 44:06.875
- Well, when you
put it like that.

44:06.959 --> 44:09.041
- Don't wait up on us kids.

44:09.125 --> 44:10.583
- Bye.
- Have fun.

44:12.792 --> 44:13.667
- So,

44:15.125 --> 44:16.625
birthday girl.
- Yes?

44:16.709 --> 44:17.458
- What do you wanna do?

44:17.542 --> 44:19.709
- I'm cool with whatever.

44:19.792 --> 44:21.542
- No, it's your day.

44:22.625 --> 44:24.041
What do you want
to get out of it?

44:24.125 --> 44:25.375
- I don't know, I'd kinda like
to go to that lookout point,

44:25.458 --> 44:26.542
you know the one
we used to go to

44:26.625 --> 44:29.667
and watch the sunset?
- Eagles Cliff?

44:29.750 --> 44:33.291
- Yeah, you remember the name.
- Of course I do.

44:33.375 --> 44:35.083
- Yeah, I was thinkin
it was that way.

44:35.166 --> 44:36.375
- The trees look
a little different

44:36.458 --> 44:39.917
because of the fire but
I'm sure we'll find it.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.583
- Alright, let's do it.

44:41.667 --> 44:43.083
- Alright.

44:43.166 --> 44:44.458
- Are you comin?

44:44.542 --> 44:46.959
- Oh no, I'm just gonna stay
here and guard the site.

44:47.041 --> 44:47.083
- Sure.

44:49.750 --> 44:50.750
Are you ready?

44:50.834 --> 44:52.333
- As I'll ever be.

44:54.166 --> 44:58.792
- Hey, what's the
big idea? (laughing)

44:58.875 --> 45:00.750
- I'm saving you from yourself.

45:00.834 --> 45:02.250
I think you've got
enough weed right there

45:02.333 --> 45:03.250
to hold you off for a while.

45:03.333 --> 45:03.792
- Oh, okay mom.

45:08.041 --> 45:12.041
Just the two of us kid. (sighs)

45:15.500 --> 45:19.291
(bong bubbles)

45:19.375 --> 45:21.792
(coughing)

45:22.542 --> 45:26.625
(laughing) I'm so high.

45:26.709 --> 45:28.834
(suspenseful music)

45:45.000 --> 45:47.709
(ominous music)

46:02.500 --> 46:04.250
- Oh Jesus.

46:23.834 --> 46:27.250
(peaceful music)
- Yeah, I like that song.

46:27.333 --> 46:30.500
(laughing)

46:32.208 --> 46:35.834
We're just gonna have our own
little dance party, Gerard.

46:35.917 --> 46:37.500
We don't need them.

46:39.709 --> 46:40.959
There's just more for us.

46:48.959 --> 46:51.166
Oh, just a little bit more.

46:54.417 --> 46:59.375
(ominous music)
(lighter striking)

47:04.917 --> 47:07.625
(bong bubbling)

47:09.291 --> 47:11.000
(ominous music)

47:21.500 --> 47:26.458
(suspenseful music)
(muffled screaming)

47:41.792 --> 47:44.583
- We're camping, remember?

47:44.667 --> 47:45.333
The wilderness.

47:45.417 --> 47:46.667
- So are there like bears too?

47:46.750 --> 47:47.417
Should we be--

47:47.500 --> 47:49.083
- Should be fine around here.

47:49.166 --> 47:51.917
I don't think they really
come near the creek.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
- I don't know, that's
what people say before

47:54.083 --> 47:55.667
they get attacked by a bear.

47:55.750 --> 47:59.083
- You're gonna love
it, just trust me okay?

47:59.166 --> 48:00.667
You're not gonna regret it.

48:00.750 --> 48:02.458
- It is a pretty creek,
I'll give you that.

48:02.542 --> 48:03.375
- You'll give me that.

48:03.458 --> 48:04.667
Oh, lucky me.

48:05.375 --> 48:07.125
Fancy.
- How fancy you are.

48:07.208 --> 48:07.875
- You know I know
how to treat you.

48:07.959 --> 48:10.291
- Don't point that at me please.

48:10.375 --> 48:12.417
- (laughs) I'm not
gonna point it at you.

48:12.500 --> 48:14.458
You are so scared.
- I'm not scared.

48:14.542 --> 48:16.458
I'm realistic.

48:16.542 --> 48:17.709
- You're realistic?
- Yeah.

48:17.792 --> 48:18.834
(cork pops)
(cheering)

48:18.917 --> 48:19.375
Don't get it on the blanket.

48:19.458 --> 48:22.125
(laughing)

48:22.208 --> 48:24.041
Oh my God, save some
for the rest of us.

48:24.125 --> 48:24.875
Thank you.

48:24.959 --> 48:26.166
- Relax, there's so much.

48:29.709 --> 48:31.959
Not too shabby, huh?

48:32.041 --> 48:33.125
- It's alrght.

48:33.208 --> 48:35.250
- Oh correction,
it's the best, okay?

48:35.333 --> 48:36.959
The best in the world.

48:37.041 --> 48:38.083
(laughing)

48:38.166 --> 48:39.417
- It's good.

48:39.500 --> 48:40.959
- It's better than
good, it's the best.

48:41.041 --> 48:42.166
I mean, look around you.

48:45.959 --> 48:46.625
- Alright, it's great.

48:46.709 --> 48:49.417
It' amazing, it's orgasmic.

48:49.500 --> 48:50.166
What do you want from me?

48:50.250 --> 48:53.583
- I want you to feel spoiled.

48:53.667 --> 48:55.709
I want you to know that
despite my reputation,

48:55.792 --> 48:58.458
I take care of
those I care about.

48:58.542 --> 49:01.625
Granted that's not many
but you're in the club.

49:01.709 --> 49:03.291
- Well I'm honored.

49:04.250 --> 49:06.625
What do you think
people say about you?

49:06.709 --> 49:08.125
- Oh, I know what they see.

49:08.208 --> 49:09.667
Heartless, cold, driven,
The B and C word,

49:09.750 --> 49:12.875
and everything in between.

49:13.875 --> 49:16.667
But that visage is
just a means to an end.

49:16.750 --> 49:18.417
- For what, world domination?

49:18.500 --> 49:19.417
(laughing)

49:19.500 --> 49:21.166
- God willing.

49:21.250 --> 49:22.875
I mean, I aim to leave a mark
on this shitty little planet.

49:22.959 --> 49:24.750
I mean, if no one remembers you,

49:24.834 --> 49:27.208
did you ever actually exist?

49:27.291 --> 49:29.750
- You may have a point there.

49:35.125 --> 49:36.208
- What's that?

49:36.291 --> 49:37.041
- Oh, nothing.

49:37.125 --> 49:37.875
Just a little party favor.

49:37.959 --> 49:38.834
- Oh, wow.

49:39.667 --> 49:40.792
Look at you.

49:41.709 --> 49:43.208
Well, anyways, I say
fuck being humble.

49:43.291 --> 49:44.041
I mean, it's better
than being a loser.

49:44.125 --> 49:48.375
That's my philosophy.
(snorting)

49:48.458 --> 49:50.458
- So what, by being
humble makes you a loser?

49:50.542 --> 49:51.959
- Hey, don't get me wrong.

49:52.041 --> 49:54.083
Losers are some of the
nicest most humble people

49:54.166 --> 49:55.041
I've ever met.

49:55.125 --> 49:56.208
Yeah it does.

49:56.291 --> 49:58.458
(laughing)

49:58.542 --> 50:00.333
(lighthearted music)
- I'm good.

50:00.417 --> 50:02.542
- Come on, I can keep
a secret if you can.

50:02.625 --> 50:03.875
- Okay, fine.

50:05.375 --> 50:08.625
- Atta girl.
(laughing)

50:10.208 --> 50:12.208
- This is like the
only thing that still

50:12.291 --> 50:14.000
looks as big from
when we were little.

50:14.083 --> 50:15.417
- Yeah, right.

50:15.500 --> 50:15.750
- Do you wanna sit there?

50:15.834 --> 50:17.250
- Yeah.

50:20.166 --> 50:23.125
How much longer til
sunset do you think?

50:23.208 --> 50:24.917
- Oh, we've still got a while.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
- Bummer.

50:26.083 --> 50:27.291
- Or, I mean, we
don't have that long.

50:27.375 --> 50:30.041
- Yeah I think the others
will be worried about us.

50:30.125 --> 50:33.291
- Oh, they can fend
for themselves.

50:33.375 --> 50:35.083
Hey, remember what you told me?

50:35.166 --> 50:36.250
- Hmm? (sighs)

50:36.333 --> 50:38.834
- Just take it all in, relax.

50:40.041 --> 50:40.750
Take it as it comes.

50:40.834 --> 50:43.375
- Sounds like a plan.

50:48.208 --> 50:50.458
- Do you remember when your
dad first brought us up here?

50:50.542 --> 50:53.333
Do you remember,
we were so tired

50:53.417 --> 50:58.458
that he had to carry us on
the way back. (laughing)

50:59.542 --> 51:02.041
- Oh man, I forgot about that.

51:04.083 --> 51:07.667
You know, I've been thinking
about him a lot lately.

51:07.750 --> 51:08.166
- Your old man?

51:10.667 --> 51:12.333
Are you guys getting along?

51:12.417 --> 51:14.458
- (scoffs) Who knows?

51:14.542 --> 51:15.750
I mean, I've been
out of the house

51:15.834 --> 51:16.750
for how long now and
do you know how many

51:16.834 --> 51:19.750
times that he's called me?

51:19.834 --> 51:21.417
Three, three times.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.291
I mean, I put in all the effort

51:24.375 --> 51:25.542
and he can't even be bothered to

51:25.625 --> 51:28.166
return a damn phone call.

51:28.250 --> 51:29.250
It's bullshit.

51:29.333 --> 51:33.125
- You know, Jess, if my
opinion means anything--

51:33.208 --> 51:34.917
- Of course it does.

51:39.417 --> 51:40.083
- My old man was an asshole.

51:40.166 --> 51:43.208
Sometimes I really hated him.

51:43.917 --> 51:46.333
Sometimes I still think I do.

51:48.959 --> 51:51.500
But at the end of the day,

51:51.583 --> 51:54.125
I couldn't find it in my heart

51:57.417 --> 52:00.458
to forgive him and
now it's too late.

52:03.583 --> 52:05.208
I just don't want that for you.

52:13.125 --> 52:14.875
- Are you okay?

52:14.959 --> 52:16.166
- Yeah, just,

52:17.041 --> 52:20.542
I'm worried I'll never be happy.

52:24.291 --> 52:26.333
- Yeah, I suppose
there are people

52:26.417 --> 52:28.250
who never rise above
their circumstance

52:28.333 --> 52:31.500
and they will always
be unhappy, sure.

52:31.583 --> 52:33.709
The world is full
of people who do.

52:33.792 --> 52:36.542
- Really?
- Yes.

52:36.625 --> 52:39.041
- Like who?
- Like right here.

52:39.125 --> 52:41.709
Me and you, two
prime candidates.

52:41.792 --> 52:43.917
- I missed you, Jess.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.041
- Oh, I missed you too.

52:49.166 --> 52:52.959
- Oh God, I'm
slobbering all over you.

52:53.041 --> 52:54.375
- Better out than in.

52:54.458 --> 52:55.458
That's what they say.

52:55.542 --> 52:57.375
You just keep lettin' it out

52:57.458 --> 53:00.041
and eventually you get over it.

53:04.917 --> 53:07.917
(ominous music)

53:08.000 --> 53:09.500
Was that for real?

53:12.000 --> 53:13.750
- I just, I thought,

53:14.834 --> 53:16.417
I thought that we--

53:16.500 --> 53:18.083
- Oh shit.
- Oh God.

53:23.250 --> 53:24.333
You didn't know?

53:24.417 --> 53:27.333
- Well, I mean, I had
my suspicions, yeah.

53:27.417 --> 53:30.375
But, we never talked about it.

53:30.458 --> 53:32.500
I mean, it's cool.

53:32.583 --> 53:34.083
It's cool, I just,

53:35.041 --> 53:37.333
a little heads up
would've been nice.

53:39.625 --> 53:39.667
You know?

53:42.208 --> 53:44.250
Hey, I'm not mad, okay?

53:46.041 --> 53:48.792
You just surprised
me, that's all.

53:51.041 --> 53:52.834
- Do you want to hear me say it?

53:52.917 --> 53:54.166
- Aubrey.

53:54.250 --> 53:56.125
No, come on.
- No, I want you to know.

53:56.208 --> 53:59.291
I have felt this
way about you since,

53:59.375 --> 54:04.375
since before I even
knew that I liked women.

54:04.458 --> 54:06.959
And I decided that no
matter how you took it

54:07.041 --> 54:09.500
I just, I needed to tell you.

54:12.041 --> 54:14.583
You know, even if you
ended up hating me.

54:19.291 --> 54:21.500
In all of my darkest times,

54:22.667 --> 54:24.583
when I was depressed
and suicidal,

54:27.083 --> 54:31.834
it was always you that brought
me through it, you know.

54:31.917 --> 54:33.417
It was always you.

54:41.458 --> 54:42.583
- I don't know what to say.

54:42.667 --> 54:46.291
- Do you feel the same
way about me at all?

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
- Not really.

54:54.500 --> 54:58.750
I mean, you're a
beautiful, beautiful person

54:58.834 --> 55:00.000
inside and out.

55:00.458 --> 55:01.709
But I just,

55:03.250 --> 55:05.500
I've thought about it, you know?

55:05.583 --> 55:10.041
Liking women, but I
just am not into women.

55:12.959 --> 55:13.834
I'm sorry.

55:17.458 --> 55:18.500
But, you know,

55:21.458 --> 55:23.542
if there ever were a woman
I could fall in love with

55:23.625 --> 55:25.000
it would definitely be--

55:25.083 --> 55:29.375
- God, you don't have to try
to make me feel better, okay?

55:30.875 --> 55:32.375
Hey, I understand.

55:45.834 --> 55:48.583
- You ready to head back?

55:48.667 --> 55:50.500
- Fuck, you're weirded out now.

55:50.583 --> 55:53.750
- No, no, no, I'm
not weirded out, no.

55:54.709 --> 55:56.125
No, I just, I think
they're gonna start

55:56.208 --> 55:59.125
to get worried about us.

56:03.917 --> 56:05.542
Come on.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.333
Come on, let's go
back to the campsite

56:10.417 --> 56:13.417
and sit around the campfire
and eat a whole bunch

56:13.500 --> 56:17.417
of s'mores and get completely,
completely shit faced.

56:17.500 --> 56:18.041
(upbeat music)

56:18.125 --> 56:19.959
What do you say, huh?

56:20.041 --> 56:22.291
(laughing)

56:22.375 --> 56:23.625
Yeah?
- Yeah.

56:23.709 --> 56:25.166
- Alright.
- Sounds good.

56:25.250 --> 56:26.500
- Let's go get fucked up.

56:29.041 --> 56:32.333
(lighthearted music)

56:50.041 --> 56:52.750
(ominous music)

57:06.417 --> 57:07.834
- So let me get this straight,

57:07.917 --> 57:09.709
you think it's perfectly
fine for a person

57:09.792 --> 57:11.333
to have no moral
boundaries in their life?

57:11.417 --> 57:12.917
- Oh no, you can
have all the morals

57:13.000 --> 57:13.667
and boundaries you want
but at the end of the day,

57:13.750 --> 57:14.667
it's not gonna mean diddly squat

57:14.750 --> 57:16.834
because you probably
won't be as successful

57:16.917 --> 57:18.333
as you would otherwise.

57:18.417 --> 57:19.333
And that's the cold,
hard, honest truth.

57:19.417 --> 57:23.709
- Yeah, I guess
you have a point.

57:23.792 --> 57:24.792
You know, I always said
it was strange that

57:24.875 --> 57:28.250
things we're supposed
to admire about people,

57:28.333 --> 57:30.291
kindness, generosity, honesty,

57:30.375 --> 57:32.417
those traits, more
often than not,

57:32.500 --> 57:34.333
are the cause of ones downfall

57:34.417 --> 57:35.500
and then the things
that we're supposed

57:35.583 --> 57:37.542
to despise in humanity,

57:37.625 --> 57:40.583
ego, greed, lack of
empathy, self-interest,

57:40.667 --> 57:43.000
those traits, more
often than not,

57:43.083 --> 57:46.000
are attributed to those
who are successful.

57:46.083 --> 57:47.250
And then the rest are failures.

57:47.333 --> 57:49.041
- Wait, I didn't say
people are failures.

57:49.125 --> 57:50.208
I said they were losers.

57:50.291 --> 57:52.125
- What's the difference?

57:52.208 --> 57:52.917
- Well, at the end of the day,

57:53.000 --> 57:54.333
everybody's just
living their life

57:54.417 --> 57:55.542
and you can't knock
them for that.

57:55.625 --> 57:56.834
But it's more likely
that the losers

57:56.917 --> 58:00.625
of this world, which
granted is most of us,

58:00.709 --> 58:02.125
aren't gonna make that
much of an impression.

58:02.208 --> 58:03.041
- So what?

58:03.125 --> 58:04.250
What if you don't
care about all that?

58:04.333 --> 58:05.000
- Trust me, everybody cares.

58:05.083 --> 58:07.542
Everybody wants to be remebered.

58:07.625 --> 58:09.041
But the fact is most of us won't

58:09.125 --> 58:13.333
and that's just a harsh
and tough thing to accept.

58:15.458 --> 58:17.959
Point is, that's all she wrote.

58:18.041 --> 58:19.583
So how you feelin' over there?

58:22.125 --> 58:23.000
- Tipsy.

58:24.542 --> 58:24.792
- Yeah, same.

58:27.500 --> 58:29.333
- I'm having a good time though.

58:29.417 --> 58:30.250
- Me too.

58:31.667 --> 58:33.709
It's crazy, it's like we're
on the same wavelength

58:33.792 --> 58:35.834
or something like we're
connected on a deeper level.

58:35.917 --> 58:36.375
- Uh-huh and now you're
making fun of me.

58:36.458 --> 58:38.458
- No, I'm serious.

58:38.542 --> 58:41.917
Why do you think we
have something going on?

58:42.000 --> 58:43.375
- You think so?

58:43.458 --> 58:45.166
- I mean, you can't deny we
have a certain connection.

58:45.250 --> 58:47.500
- So you like, like me huh?

58:47.583 --> 58:49.000
- Okay, well I'm not dead.

58:49.083 --> 58:51.250
You're smoking, that
goes without saying.

58:51.333 --> 58:56.000
But, more importantly you
got something going on.

58:56.083 --> 58:59.083
You know, between those
beautiful ears of yours,

58:59.166 --> 59:00.667
aside from a pretty face.

59:00.750 --> 59:02.417
- You think I'm smart?

59:02.500 --> 59:06.250
- That's the least of
your worries, trust me.

59:08.041 --> 59:10.125
In fact, I've never,

59:10.208 --> 59:13.792
quite met anyone like
you in my entire life.

59:13.875 --> 59:15.125
- That's not funny.

59:15.208 --> 59:17.208
- Hey, I'm serious.

59:17.291 --> 59:19.625
Scouts honor, and cross
my heart, hope to die.

59:19.709 --> 59:24.959
I really think you...
(upbeat music)

59:32.750 --> 59:33.625
You're so pretty.

59:33.709 --> 59:35.834
(laughing)

59:47.792 --> 59:50.500
(ominous music)

59:53.834 --> 59:56.166
- Hey, do you mind if we
slow this down a little bit?

59:56.250 --> 59:58.583
(mumbling)

59:58.667 --> 59:59.542
Yeah.

01:00:03.917 --> 01:00:05.000
Someone's there!

01:00:05.083 --> 01:00:05.625
- Jesus, what now?
- Over there!

01:00:05.709 --> 01:00:07.500
- What the stoner chick?

01:00:07.583 --> 01:00:09.500
I mean, who cares?
- No, it's some guy!

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:10.875
- Is this your way
of chickening out?

01:00:10.959 --> 01:00:12.792
Ow, what the hell?

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:13.667
- Come on, let's
get out of here.

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.208
- Okay.

01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:17.417
I just don't see anything.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.166
- I'm not making this up.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.667
- I'm not saying
you're making it up.

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:23.083
But what kind of perv would
just happen to be here--

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:24.208
- How the hell should I know?

01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:26.208
It could be that hunter
guy or the ranger.

01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:28.375
We told him where
we were, remember?

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.333
- Okay, sure, I'll
go check it out.

01:00:30.417 --> 01:00:30.875
- What, no.

01:00:30.959 --> 01:00:31.750
Come on, fuck that.

01:00:31.834 --> 01:00:33.959
Let's just go back
to camp, please?

01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:35.709
- First I want to
check what's going on.

01:00:35.792 --> 01:00:36.709
- What do you think
you're gonna do

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:37.917
if you actually find somebody?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:38.917
- What do you
think I'm gonna do?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.333
I'm gonna drop kick his ass.

01:00:40.417 --> 01:00:43.875
- I don't think you're
being very realistic.

01:00:43.959 --> 01:00:45.750
- Sit tight, I'll be back, okay?

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.959
(ominous music)

01:01:00.792 --> 01:01:02.250
(leaves rustling)

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:05.458
(suspenseful music)

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.166
(screaming)

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:14.375
- Sorry.
- Well done.

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:15.542
- Did you see anyone?

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:16.750
- No, not a soul.

01:01:16.834 --> 01:01:18.834
Why are your clothes on?

01:01:18.917 --> 01:01:21.083
- I was feeling uncomfortable.

01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:24.417
- Look I checked everywhere,
it's just you and me.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:27.625
- Sorry, I thought
I saw someone.

01:01:27.709 --> 01:01:28.417
- It's okay.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.083
So, you wanna head back?

01:01:31.166 --> 01:01:34.000
Oh, I thought you wanted
to go back to camp.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.625
(upbeat music)
- I did but,

01:01:38.709 --> 01:01:39.417
I don't know seeing you
run around the woods

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.542
for my honor, all protective,

01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:43.375
it kinda turned me on.

01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:45.792
- Oh, is that a fact?

01:01:45.875 --> 01:01:46.750
- It is.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:51.834
- Oh, now you're
pulling the clothes off.

01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:56.083
I see where you're at.

01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:57.375
Cheeky, cheeky.

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:02.458
I guess I was right to
bring you to the creek.

01:02:02.959 --> 01:02:05.917
(ominous music)

01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:10.250
(glass breaking)

01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:12.083
Did you hear that?

01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:13.000
- You're not funny.

01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:13.917
- Actually, I'm hilarious.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.583
Seriously, you didn't hear that?

01:02:15.667 --> 01:02:16.542
- No.

01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:18.417
I don't know what it is,

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.625
you make me feel safe.

01:02:19.709 --> 01:02:21.291
- Oh, that's my
special man-power.

01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:22.875
- Oh, is that what
they're calling it?

01:02:22.959 --> 01:02:27.917
(suspenseful music)
(screaming)

01:02:45.583 --> 01:02:47.875
(screaming)

01:02:48.917 --> 01:02:51.458
- Did you hear that?
(ominous music)

01:02:51.542 --> 01:02:52.417
- Yeah.

01:02:52.917 --> 01:02:54.041
Someone screaming.

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:58.542
(screaming)

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.125
(suspenseful music)

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:24.875
That was really weird, huh?

01:03:24.959 --> 01:03:25.792
Did you hear it again?

01:03:25.875 --> 01:03:27.208
- No, that was,

01:03:27.291 --> 01:03:29.500
where the hell is everyone?

01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:32.041
- Maybe everyone
went to the creek?

01:03:32.125 --> 01:03:34.959
(suspenseful music)

01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:38.875
- This better not be
some kind of sick joke.

01:03:41.625 --> 01:03:43.500
- What did she pass
out or something?

01:03:43.583 --> 01:03:45.375
Hey Donna, what are you,

01:03:45.458 --> 01:03:46.500
oh, my God!

01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:48.125
Oh my God!

01:03:49.709 --> 01:03:52.250
What happened to her?

01:03:53.709 --> 01:03:54.291
- We need to go find the others.

01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:56.208
- Rachel!

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:57.542
Rachel, where are you?

01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.041
- Shh.

01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:00.125
Don't do that.

01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:03.333
(screaming)

01:04:03.417 --> 01:04:04.250
Is that your blood?

01:04:04.333 --> 01:04:05.417
What happened?

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.458
- We have to go I think
he's right behind me.

01:04:07.542 --> 01:04:08.417
- Who is?

01:04:08.875 --> 01:04:10.250
Where is Rachel?

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:11.208
Where is Rachel?

01:04:11.291 --> 01:04:12.166
- Don't you
understand, she's dead!

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:14.583
He killed her and
he's gonna kill us too

01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:16.834
if we don't get the fuck
outta here right now!

01:04:16.917 --> 01:04:17.625
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:17.709 --> 01:04:18.583
No, listen.

01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:20.500
We can't just go
running without a plan.

01:04:20.583 --> 01:04:23.083
The car is four miles from here.

01:04:23.166 --> 01:04:24.041
- Well to hell with you both.

01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:25.333
I'm not gonna die out here.

01:04:25.417 --> 01:04:26.875
- Come on, Michelle!

01:04:26.959 --> 01:04:27.291
Michelle!

01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:29.000
Michelle!

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:36.375
Shit!

01:04:36.375 --> 01:04:37.125
Okay, we gotta go get her.

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:38.083
Do you have the keys?

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.959
Do you have the keys?

01:04:42.041 --> 01:04:43.166
- Yes, yes.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:43.750
But we need to go
find Rachel first.

01:04:43.834 --> 01:04:44.458
- Okay, no, no, no.

01:04:44.542 --> 01:04:47.625
Listen to me, okay?

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:48.125
Rachel is dead.

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:50.709
- You don't know that.

01:04:50.792 --> 01:04:52.125
You don't know that.

01:04:52.208 --> 01:04:53.709
She could be out there
right now needing our help.

01:04:53.792 --> 01:04:54.333
- We can not do anything to
help her right now, okay.

01:04:54.417 --> 01:04:55.542
We gotta go.

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:57.542
Alright, do you have the keys?

01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:58.250
- I don't think I can do this.

01:04:58.333 --> 01:04:59.583
I don't think I can do this.

01:04:59.667 --> 01:05:01.959
- Oh, yes you can.

01:05:02.041 --> 01:05:03.458
Yes you can, okay?

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:05.875
You got this.
- Okay.

01:05:05.959 --> 01:05:06.625
Okay.

01:05:06.709 --> 01:05:10.792
(crying) Oh my God.

01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:13.542
(ominous music)

01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:47.834
- Michelle, wait!

01:05:48.667 --> 01:05:50.625
- Which way is
that stupid trail?

01:05:50.709 --> 01:05:51.834
- Just wait, we'll show you.

01:05:51.917 --> 01:05:53.208
(suspenseful music)

01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:55.583
(screaming)

01:06:07.458 --> 01:06:08.291
You bastard!

01:06:11.417 --> 01:06:12.709
(thudding)

01:06:12.792 --> 01:06:14.083
Michelle!

01:06:14.166 --> 01:06:15.041
Michelle!

01:06:15.834 --> 01:06:16.750
Michelle!

01:06:16.834 --> 01:06:17.709
Michelle!

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.041
- We need to go.

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:24.583
(suspenseful music)

01:06:24.667 --> 01:06:26.500
Please, we need to go.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:26.959
We need to go now.

01:06:27.041 --> 01:06:28.709
We need to go!

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:32.291
(ominous music)

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:45.041
(heavy breathing)

01:06:55.709 --> 01:06:57.458
Run, we're almost to the trail!

01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:59.792
(screaming)

01:06:59.875 --> 01:07:00.709
- God.

01:07:01.959 --> 01:07:04.667
- A maniac thing, out
there trying to kill us.

01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:06.458
- Is that right?

01:07:06.542 --> 01:07:07.917
- He's killed all
of our friends.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.417
- Wait, wait, wait where?

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:09.959
Where?

01:07:10.041 --> 01:07:11.583
- He's back there.

01:07:11.667 --> 01:07:12.625
We've been running from him.

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:13.458
- Guess what?

01:07:13.542 --> 01:07:15.166
I ain't.

01:07:16.458 --> 01:07:17.792
- You don't understand.

01:07:17.875 --> 01:07:19.291
That sick bastard
is out of his mind

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:20.667
and he is gonna kill you.

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:22.625
- Yeah, well I doubt that.

01:07:22.709 --> 01:07:24.917
- No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.333
- I don't think it's
a really good idea

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:27.291
that you been messing
around with the crops.

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:29.291
Didn't I give you a
warning about that?

01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:31.000
- We didn't go messing
around with any crops.

01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:32.959
- Oh you didn't huh?
- No!

01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:34.792
- Now, let's see what's
behind the backpack then, huh?

01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:37.125
Tell me what this is, huh?

01:07:37.208 --> 01:07:38.166
What is that?

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:40.458
- No that's a mistake.

01:07:40.542 --> 01:07:42.333
- A mistake huh?
- We didn't take that.

01:07:42.417 --> 01:07:45.834
- You think this just
grew on your back?

01:07:46.709 --> 01:07:48.375
You know one thing
I really detest

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:53.083
are phonies, liars, and people
with questionable integrity.

01:07:53.166 --> 01:07:54.917
Come on, follow me.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.917
I'm gonna put an end to
this, once and for all.

01:08:02.458 --> 01:08:04.542
- Something's wrong.

01:08:04.625 --> 01:08:07.834
- You know, I hear
you whispering.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.667
You know, I think, I'm
feeling that you're conspiring

01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:12.625
to conspire.

01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:17.250
You know, that really
hurts my feelings.

01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:19.332
Where's the trust?

01:08:19.417 --> 01:08:23.542
You know, I'm a really
very sensitive guy.

01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:26.166
- I will catch up with you.

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:27.917
- Aubrey, no!
- Go!

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.291
- Hey, fuck you, pig!
(suspenseful music)

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:33.291
(ranger laughing)

01:08:36.207 --> 01:08:39.207
(arrow whizzing)
(screaming)

01:08:39.291 --> 01:08:40.166
- No!

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:45.332
(arrow whizzing)

01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:31.125
(heavy breathing)

01:09:34.166 --> 01:09:35.750
(crying)

01:09:35.834 --> 01:09:37.582
(screaming)

01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:39.000
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:09:39.082 --> 01:09:40.207
Hold your horses.

01:09:40.291 --> 01:09:42.291
Alright, I'm glad
you're enthusiastic.

01:09:42.375 --> 01:09:44.625
Just tie her up and drag
her over to the other one.

01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:46.792
Come on.

01:09:46.875 --> 01:09:47.500
Watch her, keep
your hands on her.

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:50.542
Wait, wait, wait come here.

01:09:50.625 --> 01:09:51.917
(screaming)

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Look what you made me do.

01:09:56.208 --> 01:09:59.458
Listen, no more sass
little birthday girl.

01:09:59.542 --> 01:10:02.125
You start actin' real nice.

01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:05.417
Got it?
(Jess spitting)

01:10:05.834 --> 01:10:08.667
(laughing)

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:12.000
Oh, we've got a
real live one here.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:13.792
(slapping)
(screaming)

01:10:13.875 --> 01:10:15.291
Now, you keep an eye on her.

01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:16.667
Alright?

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:20.208
Tie her up, drag her over
to the other one, now!

01:10:24.917 --> 01:10:26.333
Oo, ouchy, ouchy.

01:10:29.667 --> 01:10:32.709
Ouch that looks like
it really hurts.

01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:36.375
Here, let me see
if I can help you.

01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:40.625
(screaming)

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:43.375
Oh, man that's messy.

01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:51.417
Bring her over here.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:52.250
Take her over there.

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:58.250
(screaming)
(suspenseful music)

01:11:06.834 --> 01:11:09.000
- Why are you doing this to us?

01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:10.834
- Protecting our investments.

01:11:10.917 --> 01:11:13.041
It's nothing personal.

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:15.291
- Please we won't tell
anyone about this, okay?

01:11:15.375 --> 01:11:18.041
Just let us go, we
won't say anything

01:11:18.125 --> 01:11:20.000
to anyone, we promise.

01:11:20.083 --> 01:11:21.250
- I appreciate that
but I think we've

01:11:21.333 --> 01:11:23.875
reached the point of
no return, you know?

01:11:23.959 --> 01:11:26.125
- I mean, look at my boy.

01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:28.750
He's all giddy and he's excited,

01:11:28.834 --> 01:11:30.834
he can barely contain himself.

01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:34.458
You wouldn't want to break
his little heart would you?

01:11:34.542 --> 01:11:36.041
- You don't have to do this.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:37.208
- (chuckling) But we do.

01:11:37.291 --> 01:11:40.375
We can't take any chances.

01:11:41.291 --> 01:11:43.917
Especially around harvest time.

01:11:45.166 --> 01:11:46.041
My son, he got
out of the service

01:11:46.125 --> 01:11:49.458
and his brains were scrambled.

01:11:51.792 --> 01:11:55.542
Wasn't his fault,
they did it to him.

01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:58.458
They made him a remorseless
killing machine.

01:12:00.208 --> 01:12:02.125
Then when it was over,

01:12:02.625 --> 01:12:03.625
they spit him out.

01:12:06.959 --> 01:12:09.041
Can you believe that shit?

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:11.542
A real American hero.

01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:13.125
Christ sake.

01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:17.041
And those meds, the VA
doctors prescribed to him,

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:21.208
left him a drooling retard
and he was no good for no one.

01:12:21.291 --> 01:12:23.834
Miserable fucking cock suckers.

01:12:23.917 --> 01:12:26.750
So we looked into other options,

01:12:26.834 --> 01:12:28.875
weed seemed to help.

01:12:28.959 --> 01:12:30.250
That's how it all began.

01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:33.166
At first we planted just a
few seeds for our personal use

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:37.542
and then he really showed
a knack for being a farmer.

01:12:41.041 --> 01:12:43.875
Yeah, a real green
thumb, this guy.

01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:47.125
It was only a short
time before we realized

01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:49.583
we were making a
pretty good penny.

01:12:49.667 --> 01:12:54.041
I only wish that we could've
done it a lot sooner.

01:12:54.125 --> 01:12:56.792
But, it is what it is.

01:13:09.542 --> 01:13:11.667
(suspenseful music)

01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:17.250
(crying)

01:13:17.333 --> 01:13:20.458
- No, no, no, no!
- Jess, I love you.

01:13:20.542 --> 01:13:24.000
- I love you!
(screaming)

01:13:37.291 --> 01:13:39.834
- That's some sight, ain't it?

01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:43.500
Gruesome, blood thirsty shit.

01:13:45.166 --> 01:13:47.542
You know, I think he
got the taste of that

01:13:47.625 --> 01:13:51.250
by fucking around with
them camel jockeys.

01:13:52.417 --> 01:13:54.959
A bunch of fucking
savages, all of them.

01:13:55.041 --> 01:13:56.709
But, this is the best part.

01:13:56.792 --> 01:13:59.542
Look, you don't
want to miss this.

01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:02.583
There, see that?

01:14:04.834 --> 01:14:06.000
Do you know why they do that?

01:14:06.083 --> 01:14:09.208
Do you know why they
hold it up so high?

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.917
Because the brain is still alive

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.709
up to eight seconds
after they've cut it off.

01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:20.667
Blood just keeps flowing.

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:25.291
That's a hell of a long
time, don't you think?

01:14:25.375 --> 01:14:29.000
You can see a lot in
those eight seconds.

01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:31.583
Thoughts, feelings,
sensations, emotions.

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:38.291
You know, I often wonder
what it must be like

01:14:38.375 --> 01:14:39.750
to die like that.

01:14:42.208 --> 01:14:46.834
I was hoping that maybe
someday, somebody could tell me.

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:49.709
Maybe it could be you.

01:14:52.083 --> 01:14:53.500
What do you think?

01:14:53.583 --> 01:14:57.917
- Why don't you
ask yourself that?

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.750
Because you're
gonna die before me.

01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:04.125
- The undying
optimist, I like that.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:05.959
That's really nice.

01:15:06.041 --> 01:15:06.959
I like that thing.

01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:08.750
Let me tell you something.

01:15:08.834 --> 01:15:10.542
Happy trails, kiddo.

01:15:11.458 --> 01:15:14.750
Die you bitch.
(suspenseful music)

01:15:19.375 --> 01:15:21.583
(screaming)

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:23.834
(thudding)

01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:42.792
That fucking bitch!

01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:48.750
Alright, come on.

01:15:51.542 --> 01:15:52.333
Get up.

01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:53.959
Come on, get up.

01:15:54.041 --> 01:15:55.291
Get up and get after her, go on!

01:15:55.375 --> 01:15:58.291
Go on, you dumb moron!

01:15:58.375 --> 01:15:59.375
Get her!

01:15:59.458 --> 01:16:02.500
(suspenseful music)

01:16:13.542 --> 01:16:16.458
(heavy breathing)

01:16:37.667 --> 01:16:39.125
(suspenseful music)
- Help me, help me.

01:16:39.208 --> 01:16:40.834
- Shut up!

01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:44.709
- That son of a bitch
(mumbles) my goddamn eyes.

01:16:44.792 --> 01:16:47.166
- (whispering) You had a gun.
- Yeah.

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:49.250
- Okay, where is it?
- It's at the camp.

01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:51.041
- Okay, where is that?

01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:52.750
- I'm blind, can't you see?

01:16:52.834 --> 01:16:55.166
- Which direction is the camp?

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:55.959
- It's that way.

01:16:56.041 --> 01:16:58.417
- Okay, it's that way.
- Yeah.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.417
- Okay, okay, okay, are
you sure about that?

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.166
- Yeah, I guess.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:03.125
- Okay, you got this.

01:17:03.208 --> 01:17:04.709
Come on, let's go.

01:17:04.792 --> 01:17:09.750
(suspenseful music)
(screaming)

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.875
(screaming)
(heavy breathing)

01:17:14.959 --> 01:17:17.542
- Are you still out there boy?

01:17:17.625 --> 01:17:19.291
(suspenseful music)

01:17:19.375 --> 01:17:21.458
Where are you?

01:17:23.166 --> 01:17:24.041
Oh, God.

01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:29.208
Hey, come on.

01:17:29.291 --> 01:17:30.250
Who the fuck is this guy?

01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:32.208
Hey, come on.

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:34.208
Who the fuck is this,

01:17:34.291 --> 01:17:35.125
Oh, God.

01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:39.709
Don't do this to me.

01:17:39.792 --> 01:17:40.875
Alright, okay?

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:43.333
Come on.

01:17:43.417 --> 01:17:44.917
Please, I can't
do it without you.

01:17:49.458 --> 01:17:51.208
You sit this one out, alright?

01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:53.125
Sit it out.

01:17:56.333 --> 01:17:59.458
(suspenseful music)

01:18:12.417 --> 01:18:15.417
(upbeat music)

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.375
Well.

01:18:18.583 --> 01:18:19.959
Looks like we're at
the end of the line.

01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:22.083
- Yeah, so it would seem.

01:18:23.458 --> 01:18:27.041
- You know, being
the birthday girl,

01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:30.083
I think I'm gonna let
you make the decision.

01:18:30.166 --> 01:18:32.458
We have two options.

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:36.041
One, you can man up, turn
around, and end it quickly

01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:42.458
or you could be the little
chicken shit with a push

01:18:42.542 --> 01:18:47.250
and I would be very happy
to lend a hand for that.

01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:49.083
So, what's it gonna be?

01:18:51.875 --> 01:18:54.834
- Why are we even
foolin' ourselves huh?

01:18:54.917 --> 01:18:57.125
We both know that
you wanna do it.

01:18:57.208 --> 01:19:00.625
It's the only way that sick
perverts like you can get off

01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:01.917
because you can't get
that little pecker up

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.291
so you gotta kill things
instead, am I right?

01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:07.875
I don't smoke.

01:19:07.959 --> 01:19:10.583
- Well, that's a pity (coughing)
this is really good shit.

01:19:10.667 --> 01:19:12.041
But, you know, you got me.

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:16.417
You really did, 100%.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.041
Not about the pecker,

01:19:20.583 --> 01:19:22.792
but about killing people.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.125
Abso-fuckin-lutely.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.917
(laughing)
(moaning in fear)

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.041
Now, can you feel this?

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:34.083
I'm trembling with desire

01:19:36.083 --> 01:19:39.333
and I simply can not
wait til it's over.

01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:42.917
Are you ready to die?
- No.

01:19:46.792 --> 01:19:48.125
