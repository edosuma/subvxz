WEBVTT

03:19.000 --> 03:21.160
(COUGHS) They're here.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.440
Sergeant Harken.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.760
And...? Linus Cummins, Evening Examiner.

04:16.960 --> 04:19.640
And this is? Headman. He runs the camp.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.880
I see your passion for justice has you here a day earlier than agreed.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.480
Imagine that's why they call it a fuckin' raid, innit?

04:38.120 --> 04:40.800
In the name of Commissioner William H. Wright,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.280
I declare this premises

04:43.480 --> 04:46.200
under the putrid influence of Chink's tobacco.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.720
What is he saying?

04:53.480 --> 04:54.440
He pleads guilty.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.720
A stain on the pure spirit of the working man...

04:56.920 --> 04:59.200
..rendering of them indolent...

04:59.400 --> 05:01.240
Fuck it! Go on, then, lads.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.280
Hold on.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.320
May I?

05:18.800 --> 05:20.200
Give it to him!

05:21.520 --> 05:22.760
Aah! (THUMP)

05:25.760 --> 05:27.880
Check over there in the corner.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.320
What is it?

05:34.640 --> 05:36.800
Tell me when he wakes up.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.760
Well, holy shit! Would you look at this?

06:08.480 --> 06:11.080
I'd have thought you'd be helping prepare like everyone else.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.520
English. And I was about to say the same.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.640
It's to remind people of home.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.240
Yes. For a moment I thought we were in Guangdong.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.920
When did you start wasting your time with that stuff?

06:32.120 --> 06:35.440
The smoking or the gambling or the having friends?

06:35.640 --> 06:38.320
If you were the older brother you'd say the same!

06:46.600 --> 06:47.920
I'm having fun.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.960
There is something we should discuss, though.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.920
A problem.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.960
What now?

07:11.320 --> 07:13.120
How many like this?

07:13.600 --> 07:17.320
Four tents this morning. Another sixteen men gone.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.960
Well, the seam is drying out.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.360
We've been pushed out of the good claims.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.960
The men can't make a profit. What do we have coming?

07:25.160 --> 07:28.400
Eighteen plus one due this afternoon from Xinning, but after that...

07:28.600 --> 07:31.440
"Eighteen plus one"? What's that? That was the message.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.200
I don't know. Maybe it's a dwarf.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.600
They won't. ..and see we've been skimming the take.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.360
Hing Dai Wui or the British.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.920
They take from both sides. I'm just trying to make a living.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.560
I doubt Hing Dai Wui will see it that way.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.080
Good they don't know, then.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.920
Either way, we can't afford to lose more men.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.320
If the new Chinese tax starts...

07:58.520 --> 08:00.480
That's a rumour.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.480
If the British want more money, they take...

08:02.680 --> 08:05.160
They don't want money. They want us gone.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.560
Of course I'm bluffing. You should call.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.240
My apologies for interrupting your game, but I need...

08:42.440 --> 08:43.720
Shing!

08:44.080 --> 08:45.440
Now...

08:45.640 --> 08:49.080
Don Quixote here just folded like a little girl.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.480
But Baldy... is still weighing it up.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.000
What do you think?

09:03.040 --> 09:04.720
What are the A's?

09:05.080 --> 09:06.960
Good or bad?

09:20.000 --> 09:24.160
Probably a bit dramaturgic with the gun, but... when you need to make a point...

09:24.360 --> 09:27.560
The Chinese tax. You're adding another.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.360
I was coming to see you.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.520
There's no way we can pay more than we already are.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.880
I'm sorry that the diggers see the Chinese as a problem.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.560
Taking land, wasting water... We don't waste it.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.680
Working on a Sunday, spreading disease,

09:42.880 --> 09:44.680
general lack of Christian moral fibre.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.120
Not my argument, by the way.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.080
I've been doing my job. I need something in return.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.760
You get paid.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.800
And about your job...

09:53.560 --> 09:56.280
what's this Brotherhood I've been hearing about?

09:56.480 --> 09:58.400
'Hing Dai Wu', is it?

09:58.760 --> 10:00.160
Well, some are called that.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.000
Most are just people from the same village helping one another.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.760
But it's not easy being alone.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.080
The secret societies they have in California,

10:07.280 --> 10:09.800
importing opium illegally, gambling...

10:10.000 --> 10:11.400
We cannot have them here.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.120
People turn to them if they do not feel safe.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.480
How are they not safe?

10:15.680 --> 10:18.400
Three mining accidents just last week. One death.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.000
Ropes were cut in the night. Do you have proof?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.480
Word of my people. Oh, well, in that case...

10:24.680 --> 10:26.320
You're the Chinese Protector.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.400
The Commissioner wants law and order.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.960
Not another Buckland.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.040
That means police, troopers. That means money.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.400
That means tax.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.360
Whites attack us and we pay?

10:37.040 --> 10:38.760
I do not write the policy.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.440
The Commissioner, then. Can you get me a meeting?

10:44.800 --> 10:46.080
Doubtful.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.720
What about this party of yours?

10:54.960 --> 10:56.320
The Mid-Autumn Festival?

10:56.520 --> 10:58.400
Whites and Chinese together.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.760
That's the idea, right?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.840
I was hoping it would help to build relations, yes.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.680
You're saying you could get him to come?

11:04.880 --> 11:06.840
Well, I won't stop you trying.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.160
Truth is,

11:12.760 --> 11:14.560
you've got one job.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.320
Chinese keep to their camp, the whites will keep to theirs.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.400
No fuss, no problems.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.840
Pay your taxes. If you can't do that, I'll find someone who can.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.280
Apples!

11:35.680 --> 11:37.000
What is it?

11:37.200 --> 11:38.640
He's awake.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.280
You didn't think it might be a good idea to let me know?

12:55.480 --> 12:59.200
We were just talking. Do you know where he is or not?

13:10.960 --> 13:13.560
Time to pay the surveyor a visit.

13:17.360 --> 13:21.200
Deliver this to the Commissioner's house. Use a nice envelope.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.440
Now?

13:22.640 --> 13:24.440
What do I do with him?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.640
Why the hell should I care?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.840
Aaaah!

15:02.480 --> 15:03.720
Shit.

15:08.160 --> 15:12.160
Albert would be disappointed to see his press in this state.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.400
How is it?

15:14.600 --> 15:17.360
Need to find a part for this busted crank.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.840
Still not sure how it could have broke like that.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.440
How long?

15:22.640 --> 15:24.320
This afternoon. Good.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.520
I want to be ready for a print run tomorrow.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.080
I've made some rearrangements. Casting slugs in that drawer.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.000
Type cases are over there.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.400
I have to say I don't understand why you've made these changes...

15:33.600 --> 15:35.240
I'll be back in an hour.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.880
Mrs Roberts. Mr Chen.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.000
I am busy. You've thought about what we discussed?

16:45.920 --> 16:48.320
I need my job. I have a better one.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.880
The one that exists is better.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.680
Six shillings a day.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.720
The paper's ready to go. All I need is a translator.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.760
I have to go.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.600
Belle!

17:18.520 --> 17:19.560
Clara...

17:19.760 --> 17:22.320
Oh, I'm sorry it's been so long. I should have visited.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.520
Since the wake, I think. Four weeks.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.440
Well, you must come to the house this moment.

17:27.640 --> 17:28.920
I'm a little busy.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.800
It's only good companionship can salve a broken heart.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.320
Besides, you know, all this heat, it's terrible for the skin.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.080
And Miss Julia is in Melbourne attending the theatre,

17:40.280 --> 17:42.080
whatever that means.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.960
Elizabeth has taken to lying in. Pregnant again, no doubt.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.440
Like a sow! Piglets at teat day and night.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.760
William! Have you been smoking in there again?

17:56.720 --> 17:58.440
I am within my rights

17:58.640 --> 18:00.480
and will not apologise.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.760
So I lack for decent company. Let's say that.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.200
You have one invitation, at least.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.080
Something about a festival.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.360
It was served by some scruffy celestial this morning.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.560
Leung Wei Shing?

18:16.080 --> 18:18.800
Shing? Is that how you pronounce it?

18:19.240 --> 18:21.480
You're quite the internationalist.

18:22.080 --> 18:26.040
Mr Shing has been asking to meet me for months.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.960
The new tax, no doubt.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.520
Like a horde of human locusts.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.640
A third of the town already.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.760
Ten thousand's my understanding.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.240
I never agreed with your husband's political posturings.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.480
But he was right about the Chinaman. Never should have let them in.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.240
Like leaving the door open to flies.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.600
Have you found a buyer for the press?

18:48.960 --> 18:52.000
Not as yet. You know how I hate to pry.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.040
Word is Albert left some debt.

18:57.920 --> 19:01.160
He rarely let domestic considerations get in the way of his passion.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.600
Yes, well, for the truly great man,

19:03.800 --> 19:06.920
petty materialism is beneath concern.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.960
It's thought and action for a cause that stirs the blood.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.880
Fortunately, women more naturally

19:14.080 --> 19:16.960
enjoy petty pragmatisms the male spirit finds...

19:17.160 --> 19:18.920
dreary.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.120
If you ever need money, you know you can come to us.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.040
Within reason, of course.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.760
I'm quite sure I'll cope.

19:25.960 --> 19:29.960
My third cousin's sister-in-law found herself similarly situated.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.640
In the end had to make a living lying on her back.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.240
Until she was... consumed by the syphilis.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.640
William!

19:36.920 --> 19:41.120
Tuberculosis, and quite unconnected to the whoring, I'm sure.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.720
Do you want this?

20:22.640 --> 20:24.160
I hope you don't mind English.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.320
Ah Gok here is Hakka.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.200
Doesn't speak Cantonese, so...

20:30.200 --> 20:31.800
Oh, you have tea!

20:34.200 --> 20:36.040
You know, water heats up...

20:36.360 --> 20:38.160
it's like drinking spit.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.720
So how far did we walk?

20:43.640 --> 20:44.720
Miles.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.360
Miles.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.920
I'm the headman.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.000
Oh... oh. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

21:07.200 --> 21:09.000
I didn't, um...

21:09.200 --> 21:10.560
It's just...

21:11.320 --> 21:13.000
I was under the impression

21:13.200 --> 21:16.560
Hing Dai Wui wanted me to report back directly, so...

21:17.480 --> 21:20.280
Hing Dai Wui sent us to check up on you.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.680
Oh. (LAUGHS)

21:25.400 --> 21:28.200
In that case... come, come.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.440
The gold, of course, is in the quartz

21:33.640 --> 21:37.280
but the wind, water, it wears it down, creates deposits.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.720
So, I started in towards the prevailing wind

21:40.920 --> 21:44.160
since it strips out the cover... just a speck or two.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.160
A lot of people would have given up, but then I thought

21:47.360 --> 21:49.440
"The river is dry now

21:49.640 --> 21:52.240
"but once there must have been a flood."

22:20.960 --> 22:22.600
(BOTH LAUGH)

22:22.800 --> 22:25.200
I was about to head back tomorrow to report it.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.400
It's Mister Yong, isn't it? Yes, Yong.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.040
Yong...

22:34.960 --> 22:36.960
How long you been out here for now?

22:37.160 --> 22:40.320
Oh, nine weeks, off and on. Nine weeks... Yong!

22:40.520 --> 22:42.360
Nine weeks! (LAUGHS)

22:42.560 --> 22:45.400
You know, the moment I saw you, I thought to myself...

22:49.680 --> 22:52.480
Nine weeks. Imagine that. Hard.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.960
You know, even a mule starts to wonder what he is or...

23:01.160 --> 23:02.840
what he could be.

23:03.040 --> 23:06.200
Regrets. Opportunities missed.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.840
Eh?

23:32.560 --> 23:35.200
(ALL LAUGH)

23:46.640 --> 23:47.600
No, no!

23:47.800 --> 23:49.480
No, I will not.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.880
I will see it reported to Cheung Sifu,

23:52.080 --> 23:54.560
and when I do, I will be sure to tell him about

23:54.760 --> 23:57.400
your wholly inappropriate suggestion.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.800
Although...

24:07.160 --> 24:09.240
now that I think about it some more,

24:09.440 --> 24:11.240
we can do it your way, yeah.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.440
Should.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.800
The opportunity way that you...

24:20.880 --> 24:21.840
Ah!

24:24.920 --> 24:27.280
Are you all right? Got a problem with my tongue.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.920
Started this morning.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.680
Could be an ulcer.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.240
Yeah.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.240
(GASPS FOR AIR)

24:43.240 --> 24:46.560
(GASPS)

25:07.880 --> 25:10.080
There's a few Hakka I know who could manage it.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.600
Good diggers, but the leader will want a cut.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.280
You trust him? To be greedy.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.920
Talk to him.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.920
Oh, and I'll check in on the "18 plus one from Xinning"

25:22.120 --> 25:23.680
while we're at it.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.320
Damn it, what is this "plus one"?

25:26.520 --> 25:28.080
And don't say a dwarf.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.520
I was heading to the lumber site.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.080
It wasn't till I got further up when I saw...

25:48.640 --> 25:50.200
Saw what?

25:53.400 --> 25:54.720
About what?

25:54.920 --> 25:56.760
He's down there.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.640
What's wrong?

26:34.640 --> 26:36.640
It's a white woman.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.960
MAN: Take the fruits of your own labour

27:39.160 --> 27:42.440
for your women, your children and yourselves.

27:43.680 --> 27:46.400
Take what is rightfully yours

27:47.120 --> 27:49.200
for the call of freedom.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.280
The fruits of your own labour!

27:52.080 --> 27:53.960
To live in your own land!

27:54.600 --> 27:59.160
Our fellows in Sydney and Melbourne have already won their dignity

27:59.360 --> 28:01.760
and we can wait no longer!

28:11.400 --> 28:14.320
Got something for your arm, like we talked on the other day.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.960
Appreciate it.

28:17.680 --> 28:21.120
Man wants freedom. Man wants dignity.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.080
Separate and equal station,

28:23.280 --> 28:26.920
to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.680
The Crown will not give what we do not have the will to take.

28:30.880 --> 28:34.080
The spirit of Bakery Hill lives on!

28:35.880 --> 28:36.920
Hey!

28:37.800 --> 28:38.800
Hey!

28:42.960 --> 28:44.960
I know you, don't I?

28:45.160 --> 28:46.840
Bendigo, right?

28:49.360 --> 28:50.800
Don't think so.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.320
My mistake, then.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.040
She's too close to our trail.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.720
We need her clothes.

29:12.480 --> 29:16.360
What do you think will happen if the 'gwailou' find a murdered white woman in Chinese clothes?

29:19.040 --> 29:20.960
They'll light up the camp,

29:21.160 --> 29:23.760
burn or string up the first of us they find.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.240
Let's go.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.160
(LEAVES RUSTLE)

30:51.760 --> 30:53.280
It was her.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.600
It's a kangaroo.

30:55.800 --> 30:57.880
Should have shot it for the meat.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.760
Nothing's different.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.000
Just go about things in the normal way.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.920
What if it was?

31:09.720 --> 31:10.920
What?

31:11.280 --> 31:13.640
One of us, that did that to her?

31:14.280 --> 31:16.440
BELLE: Excuse me. Mister Leung.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.160
Leung Wei Shing?

31:18.880 --> 31:21.880
You are Leung Wei Shing? I'm sorry, and you are?

31:22.080 --> 31:24.560
Mrs Albert Roberts. I own the Ballarat Times.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.280
You work for a newspaper.

31:26.800 --> 31:27.920
Own it.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.320
And you're interrupting my afternoon because...

31:30.520 --> 31:32.160
I have a business proposition.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.520
I've yet felt the need to pay for female company,

31:34.760 --> 31:37.840
though I suggest you're a shade on the older side to demand too steep a value.

31:38.040 --> 31:42.400
Good. Because I own a paper. As I've said. Twice.

31:42.600 --> 31:43.800
And my connection?

31:44.040 --> 31:47.280
I intend starting a Chinese print edition to serve the Chinese population.

31:47.480 --> 31:50.000
I'm looking for advertisers. That's your pitch?

31:50.240 --> 31:53.240
I don't need a pitch, just men with the half sense to do what is obvious.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.520
And what exactly would I be advertising?

31:55.720 --> 31:58.920
Your next festival. A letter opposing the Chinese tax.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.360
I'm taking care of that already.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.160
With little success, I'm afraid.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.920
Where did you get that?

32:11.120 --> 32:13.040
Rescued from the rubbish.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.920
My proposal is straightforward.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.480
I'll bring the Commissioner to your festival this evening.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.360
You advertise in my publication.

32:20.560 --> 32:22.760
Even pound a week for say...

32:22.960 --> 32:24.560
six months.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.680
Then we'll review.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.200
Some people would call that blackmail.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.000
Some people have sawdust in place of brains.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.760
Are you always like this? I don't take the meaning.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.960
Perhaps I just haven't met enough white women.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.600
There's a wide variation, I can assure.

32:42.800 --> 32:46.840
Get the Commissioner to the festival and we'll make it a year.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.040
She's pretty.

32:59.320 --> 33:02.280
Too busy having my pockets picked to notice.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.440
Carry on like that, you'll earn a whole pack of nuts.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.480
Cheap ones, maybe.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.040
Right there, son?

33:26.240 --> 33:29.640
I can take this. It's, uh... the rule.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.680
Site free more than a day.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.560
It's the rule.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.800
Earle, Burke. I'm Patrick.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.160
Daniel Price.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.760
So... what the heck is that for?

33:43.320 --> 33:45.320
I thought perhaps during lunch breaks.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.320
Get a game going.

33:48.920 --> 33:53.320
When's the last time you had some female-type interaction there, son?

33:53.840 --> 33:57.120
Maybe we can gab about something other than women for one minute of the day?

33:57.320 --> 33:59.200
Easy for you. You have one.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.840
Finest-looking lady this side of Melbourne.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.600
What she sees with this shitknuckle is a mystery for the ages.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.760
Where is she anyhow?

34:13.120 --> 34:14.960
I'm going into town.

34:38.520 --> 34:39.920
MAN: Name.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.960
Patrick Thomas.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.640
Buy yourself a nice meal with all this.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.520
Oh, looky here.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.320
Twice in a day we meet.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.520
If I were a religious man,

35:42.800 --> 35:44.520
I would say that was...

35:45.080 --> 35:46.520
What's the word?

35:46.720 --> 35:47.680
Providence.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.280
Providence.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.120
Aye. I like that.

35:52.520 --> 35:56.320
I always think, if you learn a new word every day,

35:57.160 --> 35:59.240
the only way is up.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.560
Patrick fuckin' Thomas is it now?

36:03.880 --> 36:05.240
Funny.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.480
I could swear you're a dead ringer

36:08.200 --> 36:10.760
for a certain Dylan Walsh.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.120
Aye.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.320
Fuckin' thought so.

36:17.720 --> 36:20.160
Do admire your optimism, though,

36:20.560 --> 36:22.440
thinking you can hide.

36:23.960 --> 36:26.080
There's a rule for traitors.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.440
You and your fuckin' wife.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.480
Don't talk about her.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.600
You ain't.

37:41.720 --> 37:42.840
Here.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.880
Who told you to do this?

38:00.720 --> 38:02.320
Doctor.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.480
You're lucky it ain't green.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.440
Burn like this, can't let it dry out.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.160
How'd it happen?

38:11.320 --> 38:12.720
Heat.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.800
I appreciate the attention.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.440
I do it for money, not gratitude.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.200
Emu fat, twice a day.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.640
Say when you want more.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.200
(BIRDS TWITTER)

39:34.400 --> 39:36.040
Why would I want it back?

39:36.920 --> 39:39.880
Oh, I just assumed. But of course, it's no problem.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.880
Just since I talked to Harriet Morgan.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.560
Harriet? You know she started smoking cigarettes.

39:44.760 --> 39:48.680
Like some bohemian. Next she'll be wearing tails and a monocle.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.040
No man wants a woman who acts like another man.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.360
The whole concept is repulsive.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.280
Well, so nice to see you again.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.800
Well, what about her?

40:02.160 --> 40:03.440
Harriet?

40:03.640 --> 40:07.040
Oh. Just her sister's husband's father was in Paris last year

40:07.240 --> 40:09.640
and he said China's all the vogue right now.

40:09.840 --> 40:13.440
Really? Hm. Clothes, food... art.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.840
So she's going to the festival. With George.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.560
George Reynolds?

40:19.360 --> 40:22.160
It's such a pity William doesn't want to go.

40:22.360 --> 40:25.160
But I guess there's not a lot you can do about it.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.560
Eighteen plus one is here.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.120
Eighteen...

41:13.880 --> 41:15.360
... plus one.

43:21.320 --> 43:24.920
I have some secondary duties, of course.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.800
You are comfortable with English?

43:29.240 --> 43:31.760
Of course. Good.

43:31.960 --> 43:36.560
I will be meeting our new surveyor, Yong Gwan, to discuss his findings.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.720
Well, I'm sure we can dig him up.

43:45.960 --> 43:49.320
And I'll require access to your record of the gold take.

43:50.440 --> 43:53.520
Well, Hing Dai Wui already has all our records.

43:55.440 --> 43:58.720
Though, obviously, I am proud...

43:58.920 --> 44:01.560
to have the chance to show our achievements.

44:20.520 --> 44:22.360
Find out where she was last.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.920
Something about California. You've spent time there.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.640
And anything else you can.

Hau Ngai.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.280
The land was being burned by ten suns.

47:30.480 --> 47:32.040
He shot down nine

47:32.240 --> 47:35.640
and was given an elixir of immortality as a reward.

47:35.920 --> 47:38.000
So he's still about, then?

47:38.440 --> 47:40.040
Fortunately, no.

47:40.240 --> 47:43.120
Since the power turned him into a tyrant,

47:43.320 --> 47:45.440
he tried to murder his wife.

47:45.640 --> 47:49.320
She fled, and became the Spirit of the Moon.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.200
Commissioner!

47:54.960 --> 47:57.000
Surprised to see you here.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.480
You can thank my beautiful wife.

48:00.200 --> 48:02.520
Have you met Wei Shing, my best headman?

48:02.720 --> 48:06.320
Despite putting on a party with very little liquor. (CHUCKLES)

48:08.960 --> 48:11.880
You'll find he has an interesting view about the new tax.

48:13.160 --> 48:14.360
I'm sure.

48:16.200 --> 48:18.360
We shouldn't be here.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.920
I'm sorry? The Chinese.

48:21.920 --> 48:24.560
We take your land, your jobs.

48:24.760 --> 48:27.680
Look the same, sound the same, more every day.

48:29.080 --> 48:30.760
So you do what you can.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.760
The tax, for example.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.800
I would do the same myself. There is a natural order.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.640
There is.

48:40.840 --> 48:45.320
So, the question is not about who has power, but how to keep it.

48:45.680 --> 48:46.880
Indeed.

48:47.080 --> 48:49.320
There is a thousand Chinese in this camp

48:49.520 --> 48:52.280
and they all do one thing: they work.

48:52.960 --> 48:56.560
And yes, they will pay more tax and I will collect it.

48:56.960 --> 48:59.320
But it will not be long before I am blamed

48:59.520 --> 49:01.640
and then you will have a new headman here

49:01.840 --> 49:03.960
and new headmen all over the diggings.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.720
But they will not be like me. They will be... trouble.

49:09.920 --> 49:12.120
Will they? Yes.

49:12.320 --> 49:14.360
Well, you have soldiers and police

49:14.560 --> 49:16.680
but they cost money.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.800
See, I may not be as wise

49:20.000 --> 49:21.640
or strong...

49:21.840 --> 49:23.600
but I am yours.

49:24.440 --> 49:28.080
I make things easy. Why mess with that?

49:33.760 --> 49:35.520
I'll bring it up with the Governor.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.640
Darling. Oh... yes.

49:44.840 --> 49:46.840
I admit I'm impressed.

49:48.200 --> 49:50.040
For a white woman.

50:32.680 --> 50:33.760
What?

50:34.200 --> 50:36.440
One of our people just came back from California.

50:36.640 --> 50:38.000
She was there.

50:38.560 --> 50:40.600
Three camps all went the same.

50:40.800 --> 50:42.920
Cheung wants a headman gone, Lei makes it happen.

50:43.120 --> 50:46.200
From what I understand, she's not afraid to take things to extremes.

50:47.440 --> 50:49.160
She's here for you.

51:22.880 --> 51:25.400
Is everything okay? You shouldn't miss the sky lanterns.

51:25.640 --> 51:28.480
It's quite the sight for the first time. I'm sorry. Something's happened.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.120
There's something wrong?

51:30.320 --> 51:32.320
There's been a woman murdered.

51:42.080 --> 51:44.320
Where was she? Who found her?

51:44.520 --> 51:46.600
Sheep farmer's dog sniffed her out.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.720
She's cut right open.

51:49.600 --> 51:51.320
Where's she from?

51:51.760 --> 51:55.200
We need her name. Does anyone know her?

51:55.400 --> 51:57.120
