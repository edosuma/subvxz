WEBVTT

00:08.151 --> 00:10.786
I thought I meant
something to you Eddie!

00:10.851 --> 00:13.765
But if you give up now you're not
just giving up on yourself...

00:15.008 --> 00:16.705
you're giving up on us!

00:17.761 --> 00:19.921
You think I don't know that.

00:21.699 --> 00:24.361
You think this isn't
tearing me apart inside.

00:24.978 --> 00:26.574
Arr....

00:27.818 --> 00:32.154
Then hang on Eddie! Hang on to the
life that we could have together!

00:32.468 --> 00:34.990
But the water is so cold Joannie...

00:35.229 --> 00:37.682
I can't feel my legs.

00:41.197 --> 00:45.546
I'm sorry. I just... I just need a
second to get back into character.

00:45.889 --> 00:48.968
You know, so I can give back
everything you're giving me.

00:49.865 --> 00:51.853
I did sense you were holding back.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.838
That's why you're the best
casting director in town!

00:55.761 --> 00:56.855
He's killing me.

00:57.978 --> 00:59.098
Just calm down honey.

00:59.438 --> 01:00.475
Calm down?

01:00.934 --> 01:05.253
How am I supposed to convince Rob Reiner
one of the top directors in Hollywood that
I'm right for the part

01:05.467 --> 01:08.973
if I'm auditioning with a cross
between Shia LaBoring and Tom Snooze.

01:09.447 --> 01:13.271
Or, Leonardo Decarmitoz and
Snorlando Bloom! Hahaha!

01:15.854 --> 01:17.485
I laughed at yours!

01:19.381 --> 01:20.886
I got an idea, darling.

01:21.169 --> 01:25.303
Excuse me, Howard. Would it be alright
if I read the lines with Hannah one time?

01:25.358 --> 01:27.370
You know, it might just
make her more comfortable.

01:27.868 --> 01:30.764
But can you deliver the lines
with the same passion I do?

01:31.485 --> 01:32.939
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

01:34.315 --> 01:36.501
OK then. Action.

01:38.846 --> 01:42.438
Then hang on Eddie. Hang on to the
life that we could have together.

01:43.654 --> 01:46.029
But the water is so cold Joannie.

01:46.386 --> 01:47.992
I can't feel my legs.

01:48.194 --> 01:49.049
Shivers.

01:51.013 --> 01:53.272
Ar, I'm sorry, who's Shivers?

01:53.864 --> 01:55.598
Is that my cutsie name for you,
or something,

01:55.625 --> 02:00.647
cause it feels like such a weird time that
I'd be saying it knowing that my leg would
be...

02:02.330 --> 02:02.866
Hey daddy!

02:04.283 --> 02:05.197
You're supposed to be shiver there.

02:05.198 --> 02:07.296
Oh, OK. Give me one
more try please.

02:08.140 --> 02:10.696
And... action

02:11.412 --> 02:15.378
Then hang on Eddie! Hang on to
the life we could have together.

02:16.243 --> 02:19.060
Oh. But the water
is so cold Joannie.

02:19.205 --> 02:21.072
I can't feel my legs.

02:21.428 --> 02:23.340
Shiver!

02:25.039 --> 02:27.067
Lola! Maybe you
should read with me.

02:28.838 --> 02:30.291
It was the shivers, wasn't it?

02:30.587 --> 02:32.441
This stupid red light
made me nervous!

02:35.517 --> 02:36.880
Are you sure you want me to...

02:36.881 --> 02:40.337
Lola, just read the line and for the love
of pig give me something to work with!

02:41.560 --> 02:45.447
OK, Let's make some magic.

02:47.143 --> 02:50.554
Then hang on Eddie. Hang on to the
life that we could have together.

02:51.112 --> 02:59.557
But the water! It's sooo...
. cold! J-j-j-joannie!

02:59.698 --> 03:04.349
I can't feel my legs!

03:11.398 --> 03:13.559
What about you and me from the top,
one more time, what do you say?

03:15.685 --> 03:16.613
#Hannah Montana 3-07#

03:16.869 --> 03:17.925

03:33.732 --> 03:37.823
#it's really you but

03:38.544 --> 03:41.644
#who would've thought
that a girl like me...#

03:41.696 --> 03:46.872
#would double as a superstar~~~~~~#

03:47.968 --> 03:51.548
#you get the best of both worlds#

03:52.048 --> 03:55.689
#chill it out take it slow

03:55.691 --> 03:59.722
#you get the best of both worlds#

04:00.200 --> 04:05.194
#mix it all together and you'll know
that it's the best of both worlds#

04:09.687 --> 04:13.229
- Come on, come on, come on, come, on!
- Mile, you just auditioned an hour ago!

04:13.652 --> 04:15.811
Yeah, but it's Rob Reiner!

04:16.072 --> 04:18.103
Princess Bride,
When Harry met Sally

04:18.398 --> 04:20.209
and now his directing
the next raiders!

04:20.587 --> 04:21.598
Can't you just see it?

04:21.970 --> 04:24.951
Hannah Montana is
'Indiana Joannie'!

04:26.064 --> 04:28.834
Hey, I am hooting for you too darling,
but you gotta relax.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.528
He probably hasn't even
seen your audition tape yet.

04:31.529 --> 04:33.199
Yeah, you're right.

04:33.738 --> 04:35.501
I probably won't hear till Monday.

04:35.630 --> 04:37.260
And besides - I'm Hannah Montana.

04:37.844 --> 04:41.619
Life is good. I've got an amazing career.
If I get it, then I get it.

04:42.162 --> 04:44.021
And If I don't then...

04:44.071 --> 04:45.291
Out of my way old man!

04:48.159 --> 04:48.757
Hello?

04:50.233 --> 04:52.089
Listen, I really need
to keep this line open,

04:52.119 --> 04:54.531
I promise I'll save the
dolphins tomorrow. Buh-bye.

04:55.603 --> 04:57.853
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

04:58.323 --> 05:03.550

05:20.779 --> 05:23.707
Hahaha! Even in my sleep
I'm smarter than you.

05:31.101 --> 05:31.934
Miley?

05:33.242 --> 05:36.621
Two bars... one bar,
one bar! Oh no, one bar!

05:36.787 --> 05:38.888
Will you put that away!
We're here for Oliver.

05:39.314 --> 05:41.332
Sure, it's just an audition
to play at the school dance,

05:41.363 --> 05:43.696
but this means as much to him
as the movie does to you.

05:44.066 --> 05:46.704
Yeah, you're right, I'm totally
here for him... Four bars! Yes!!

05:47.917 --> 05:50.377
What? Can't support him
from behind this trash can?

05:52.035 --> 05:55.015
One bar!! Nooo!

05:55.657 --> 05:56.619
Hi Oliver!

05:57.021 --> 06:01.087
What's up guys? You know thank you so much
for being here. I can't believe how nervous
I am.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.854
Oh don't worry you gonna do great!

06:02.856 --> 06:05.646
Yeah! And you know what,
here's a... here's an idea.

06:07.255 --> 06:12.396
Let's make sure the sound travels well, so
you know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go
stand in the hall, you know - Maybe just by
that trash can, right underneath it...

06:13.292 --> 06:15.787
- Oken. Are you ready?
- Yes sir.

06:15.961 --> 06:18.335
- Go get them!
- You're gonna do great!

06:19.676 --> 06:23.109
Two bars! One bar! Oh mud crunkies!

06:23.678 --> 06:25.510
#I need a kick drum#

06:27.357 --> 06:28.821
#a guitar now#

06:30.416 --> 06:32.148
#and a bass line#

06:33.691 --> 06:34.992
#and I'm gonna show you how#

06:35.490 --> 06:38.369
#how to rock how to
dance how to get down#

06:38.451 --> 06:41.410
#and all I need is a
piano in my track now#

06:41.451 --> 06:44.606
#throw your hands throw your
hands throw your hands up#

06:44.868 --> 06:47.261
#whoa...#

06:47.339 --> 06:51.197
#Cause you can't, cause you can't,
cause you can't, cause you can't stop!#

06:51.198 --> 06:54.088
#whoa...#

06:55.237 --> 06:57.476
- Wow, he is really good!
- Yeah. Great.

07:00.016 --> 07:03.273
#cause we're here and we're
now and we all together

07:03.320 --> 07:06.828
so let's make this last forever#

07:08.364 --> 07:10.518
Hey, Mr. Meadows is liking it too!

07:11.834 --> 07:12.399
Miley?

07:15.460 --> 07:16.477
Miley?

07:19.278 --> 07:22.975
#throw your hands throw your
hands throw your hands up#

07:23.317 --> 07:25.849
#whoa...#

07:25.850 --> 07:29.627
#Cause you can't, cause you can't,
cause you can't, cause you can't stop!#

07:29.715 --> 07:32.378
#whoa...#

07:32.672 --> 07:35.968
#oh can you hear me!
do you feel it!#

07:36.017 --> 07:38.364
#if you with me go 1 2 3 4#

07:38.477 --> 07:41.877
#cause we're here and we're
now and we all together

07:41.948 --> 07:45.546
so let's make this last forever#

07:48.403 --> 07:52.026
Yow, Jackson. Where is that dummy?

07:54.082 --> 07:57.630
I prefer the term,
"Wooden American"

07:59.077 --> 08:00.898
And I prefer the term,
"you're fired".

08:02.823 --> 08:04.260
What you doing with
that thing anyway?

08:04.528 --> 08:08.316
Earning three hundred bucks. I'm the
entertainment at Douggie Sorbone's birthday
party.

08:09.106 --> 08:14.535
You're the entertainment? I'm the
entertainment! Without me you're just a
hand!

08:14.644 --> 08:17.531
Oh! yeah, could
just a hand do this?

08:20.035 --> 08:25.089
She'll be coming round the mountain when
she comes! She'll be coming round the
mountain when she comes.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.366
They're paying you three
hundred dollars for this?

08:27.888 --> 08:32.611
Wow, Douggie Sorbone's gonna learn about
disappointment at a very early age.

08:33.140 --> 08:34.191
I wasn't finished yet.

08:34.583 --> 08:41.433
- Franklin, say 'argh'.
- argh

08:42.082 --> 08:44.534
Hehehehe!

08:47.700 --> 08:52.905
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

08:48.821 --> 08:52.905
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

08:51.018 --> 08:52.905
Come on, come on, come on!

08:54.345 --> 08:59.258
Are we going to spend the entire weekend
waiting to see if you got the part or - you
got the gig?

09:00.607 --> 09:03.528
Wake up! Move! Do something!

09:07.782 --> 09:09.801
- There!
- Happy?

09:10.171 --> 09:14.273
It is times like these I thank
my lucky stars I have no talent.

09:14.854 --> 09:17.109
I didn't get the part.
That's why Howard hasn't called me.

09:17.451 --> 09:18.440
He doesn't have the guts.

09:19.679 --> 09:22.575
Or - he's having problems with his
guts and he's in the bathroom.

09:23.384 --> 09:25.173
Poor Howard. Call!

09:26.008 --> 09:29.040
You know, I sing great. Mr.
Meadows is just jealous.

09:29.415 --> 09:30.681
He's jealous that he
doesn't have my talent

09:30.694 --> 09:33.621
I mean you know what they say,
"those he can't sing, teach".

09:34.185 --> 09:36.599
Hey, maybe I should be a teacher.

09:38.174 --> 09:40.398
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

09:40.453 --> 09:41.696
Answer the phone!

09:44.581 --> 09:46.784
Hey! I'd be a good teacher.

09:46.860 --> 09:51.335
Supportive, fun. But no talking back!
That is unacceptable. Unacceptable I say!

09:52.256 --> 09:55.292
Yeah, I totally understand.
Thanks for the call.

09:56.224 --> 09:59.938
- Ohh..
- I got a callback! I'm meeting Rob Reiner!

10:03.956 --> 10:07.752
Yes sir. I completely understand.
Thanks for the call.

10:14.617 --> 10:15.268
Why aren't you jumping?

10:15.301 --> 10:16.068
Why aren't you yaying?

10:16.106 --> 10:17.568
Why aren't you jumping and yaying?

10:18.530 --> 10:19.455
I didn't get it.

10:20.261 --> 10:21.719
I'm sorry Oliver.

10:23.175 --> 10:25.531
It's OK, there'll be other dances.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.870
I know, it's just, I wanted this so
bad and I really thought I had it.

10:29.617 --> 10:30.697
I know how you feel.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.767
No you don't Miley.

10:34.122 --> 10:37.593
I mean, seriously, when was the last time
Hannah Montana wanted something that she
didn't get?

10:37.693 --> 10:41.358
Oh well there's that one time
that .. oh no I got that.

10:41.515 --> 10:45.817
Oh, oh, I remember this one time... no,
I broke the house record there.

10:46.171 --> 10:49.695
Oh, I was so devastated when...
that turned out great.

10:52.137 --> 10:53.716
You're not really helping.

10:54.732 --> 10:56.303
Yeah Miley, I mean, lets face it.

10:56.561 --> 10:58.205
You get everything you go after

10:59.892 --> 11:02.660
Hold on... when,
when did this become about me?

11:02.961 --> 11:04.621
I don't know, I mean,it's just...

11:04.622 --> 11:07.292
you know sometimes being around all
your success kinda makes me feel...

11:07.405 --> 11:09.830
- Like a failure?
- I was going to say bad.

11:12.345 --> 11:15.348
I'm sorry Oliver,
I would never do that on purpose.

11:15.479 --> 11:17.178
I know, I'm not saying
it's your fault.

11:17.373 --> 11:18.905
I'm just saying...

11:19.482 --> 11:22.688
Miley, it used to be a lot easier hanging
out with you when I didn't know your secret.

11:22.689 --> 11:24.944
Did I mention I want
to be a teacher?

11:26.551 --> 11:30.059
Oliver, you're acting like you don't even
want to be my friend anymore, thats crazy.

11:30.515 --> 11:33.901
I dunno. I gotta go.

11:36.681 --> 11:37.819
Do you believe him?

11:38.369 --> 11:40.345
He's acting like I get
everything I want.

11:42.308 --> 11:47.685
Yeh Doggies! Mile! Your album just went
double platinum! Yay, yay, yay, yay!

11:52.077 --> 11:53.887
Come on Oliver, pick up!

11:54.685 --> 11:55.434
Oliver!

11:55.685 --> 11:58.579
Mile! That's the tenth
time you've called him.

11:58.859 --> 12:01.049
Just give the boy some space,
he'll come around.

12:01.205 --> 12:02.040
Really?

12:02.645 --> 12:04.204
Well, we can only hope. I mean,

12:04.264 --> 12:07.055
the truth is, there are
no guarantees in life.

12:07.318 --> 12:11.582
Some friends come in your life for a
reason... others only for a season.

12:13.064 --> 12:16.496
Hey, that's good! I think I got
the beginnings of your next hit!

12:17.979 --> 12:20.871
Daddy, I don't need another hit,
I need Oliver.

12:22.221 --> 12:24.505
But if you just want to tinker around
a little bit, I won't stop you!

12:26.826 --> 12:27.785
Daddy, it's him!

12:27.872 --> 12:31.998
That's great, that's great. If he says
anything heartfelt or painful, let me know.

12:32.465 --> 12:34.402
And if it rhymes, all the better!

12:36.241 --> 12:39.757
- Oliver! Hey, I'm so glad that you called.
- It's me, hold on.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.572
Oliver, stop this and talk to her!

12:42.725 --> 12:45.228
Hi, I can't talk right now.

12:45.271 --> 12:46.876
There, I talked to her.

12:48.860 --> 12:52.088
What's it going to take to make you
feel better? Miley not getting the part?

12:52.094 --> 12:54.122
Yeah Lily, like that
would ever happen.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.694
Oliver, I swear if you
don't talk to her --

12:58.419 --> 12:59.871
This is going down your shirt.

12:59.872 --> 13:02.382
Well then I guess it's going down my
shirt because I'm not talking to her.

13:04.161 --> 13:06.251
Oh oh oh ahh!

13:10.348 --> 13:11.631
Are you sure you want to do this?

13:12.003 --> 13:15.364
No. But Oliver's so miserable
what choice do I have?

13:16.527 --> 13:19.936
Now get ready for the best
acting performance of my life.

13:20.603 --> 13:23.639
Lola. The door...

13:29.110 --> 13:31.733
Rob! Darling!

13:31.822 --> 13:33.858
Hannah, I've been looking
forward to meeting you.

13:34.167 --> 13:37.685
Why isn't he standing?
I entered, didn't I?

13:38.378 --> 13:39.577
Is she serious?

13:40.983 --> 13:44.459
Please! Just do it!
She has my mother.

13:45.755 --> 13:48.698
You want me stand, I'll stand.
Nice to meet you.

13:50.241 --> 13:51.426
Sanitize me!

13:52.747 --> 13:55.962
Good, another well
adjusted hollywood actress.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.920
Can we, can we, sit?

13:57.974 --> 13:58.482
Pillow me!

14:00.187 --> 14:01.177
Pillow ma'am!

14:04.480 --> 14:06.237
Maybe we should just read.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.947
Oh that would be great. First I
just have a few notes on the script.

14:10.338 --> 14:11.386
Note number one --

14:14.645 --> 14:15.528
You didn't like it?

14:16.766 --> 14:18.783
"Fade In"?

14:18.885 --> 14:21.498
How many times has
that been done before?

14:21.907 --> 14:23.268
I thought it was pretty good.

14:23.688 --> 14:27.733
Haha! Well. That would
explain your shirt.

14:28.512 --> 14:32.932
Haha ha...laugh Please Laugh.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.046
I'm not gonna laugh!

14:35.397 --> 14:38.191
She trashes my script,
she insults my shirt,

14:38.230 --> 14:40.973
and... and what is
with that stuffed dog!

14:41.156 --> 14:45.753
Oh!Stuffed! Captain
Cuddles is a real dog!

14:46.069 --> 14:47.458
Real I tell you!

14:48.178 --> 14:51.208
Listen, Hannah- No,
you listen, meathead!

14:52.898 --> 14:54.569
- You insult Fluffy ...
- Captain Cuddles!

14:54.654 --> 14:56.203
AKA Captain Cuddles...

14:56.404 --> 14:57.725
You insult me!

14:57.732 --> 15:00.553
Now apologize. He's waiting.

15:01.499 --> 15:03.891
I've never talked to a
stuffed animal in my life!

15:03.989 --> 15:06.275
Except my Aunt Esther
at Thanksgiving dinner.

15:06.863 --> 15:09.619
Talk about a rodent
of unusual size!

15:10.790 --> 15:13.786
You don't want to work with me?
That is your loss sir.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.227
Lola, the door!

15:21.150 --> 15:22.259
Come on, Sparky!

15:22.331 --> 15:24.245
AKA Fluffy, AKA Captain Cuddles.

15:24.316 --> 15:26.093
Zip it! I have your mother.

15:27.711 --> 15:28.947
You got the part!

15:29.894 --> 15:32.249
Hot shot Hollywood honcho say what!

15:32.896 --> 15:34.938
You really had me going
there for a while.

15:35.024 --> 15:38.136
But that commitment you made
to that whole diva thing...

15:38.137 --> 15:40.097
that is exactly what
I'm looking for!

15:40.320 --> 15:43.082
Welcome aboard... Indiana Joannie!

15:43.117 --> 15:46.632
No, no, no, no.
See I... really am wacky.

15:46.633 --> 15:50.208
One minute I'm perfectly fine and... and
the next, I'm pouring iced water down your
shirt.

15:50.371 --> 15:52.236
Oh come on, like you would do that.

15:52.499 --> 15:54.492
Lola.

15:55.203 --> 15:57.102
Oh oh ah

16:06.141 --> 16:09.407
Hey Franklin. What did one
wall say to the other?

16:10.338 --> 16:14.105
Meet you at the corner!

16:14.605 --> 16:17.346
Hello! Doing homework here.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.511
Hello! Rehearsing here.

16:20.511 --> 16:23.213
Hey Franklin, tell the
kids how you make time fly.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.793
If x + seven = 6 x y...

16:25.905 --> 16:30.289
You throw the clock out
the window! hahaha!

16:30.398 --> 16:33.278
Hey Franklin, do you want to
know how to make a dummy fly?

16:41.221 --> 16:42.042
Woops!

16:43.468 --> 16:47.137
Yeah! Well your little 'woops'
just cost me three hundred bucks.

16:47.370 --> 16:48.206
Cough it up.

16:48.355 --> 16:52.030
Oh, about that. My accounts are
kinda frozen at the moment.

16:52.450 --> 16:53.138
Why?

16:55.093 --> 16:56.480
I didn't eat my vegetables.

16:57.832 --> 17:00.046
- What?
- I didn't eat my vegetables, OK!

17:01.758 --> 17:04.164
I'll make it up to you,
don't worry.

17:04.496 --> 17:07.608
Yeah. You will.
And I know exactly how.

17:10.462 --> 17:14.762
And now, the amazing Jackson Stewart
and his little friend Franklin!

17:18.228 --> 17:21.748
Hey kids! I heard it's somebody's
birthday. Where's Douggie?

17:22.395 --> 17:27.445
- Alright! Say, Happy Birthday Franklin!
- Happy Birthday Franklin!

17:30.253 --> 17:33.709
Oh Franklin, you big silly.
Which reminds me.

17:33.881 --> 17:36.319
You ever wonder why
elephants are so wrinkled?

17:36.602 --> 17:39.318
No. Why are elephants so wrinkled?

17:39.471 --> 17:42.127
You ever tried to iron one! Whoa!

17:44.781 --> 17:46.057
You're dying here.

17:46.547 --> 17:49.198
Ha! Everybody's a critic.

17:50.460 --> 17:54.147
And, speaking of critics,
what did one wall say to the other?

17:54.272 --> 17:56.973
Meet you at the corner!

17:57.557 --> 18:00.092
And he calls me the dummy!

18:01.956 --> 18:05.451
OK Franklin... um.
How do you make time fly?

18:06.031 --> 18:08.747
Not by listening to you. You stink!

18:10.798 --> 18:11.822
What are you doing?

18:12.071 --> 18:15.564
Getting laughs. Which is more
than you're doing, loser!

18:19.489 --> 18:23.012
Stop it! You.... you little rascal.

18:23.833 --> 18:25.014
Doing the water bit.

18:25.210 --> 18:25.732
No.

18:25.977 --> 18:27.592
We're doing the water bit!

18:28.731 --> 18:32.980
Hey kids Franklin is going to sing happy
birthday while I drink some water.

18:34.937 --> 18:36.557
Or I can just do this.

18:42.383 --> 18:44.533
Oh you are so going
to get it later.

18:44.534 --> 18:45.839
And you're going to get it now!

18:55.818 --> 18:57.921
- What a hit, Keep going!
- My pleasure!

19:11.114 --> 19:13.896
I can't believe I'm going
to meet Taylor Swift!

19:14.430 --> 19:15.650
When can I take off the blind fold?

19:15.917 --> 19:18.847
Um not till we're inside. You know she
doesn't want anybody to know where she
lives.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.895
This is Miley's house!

19:26.001 --> 19:30.470
Miley! I've never seen you so down.
What's wrong.

19:32.533 --> 19:36.142
I... I just can't talk about it.

19:37.059 --> 19:37.621
I'm outta here

19:37.907 --> 19:42.055
Wait. Something terrible must've
happened. Let's go find out.

19:42.742 --> 19:44.804
Miley. Talk to us please!

19:45.712 --> 19:48.027
- I didn't get the part.
- Ohhh!

19:49.648 --> 19:52.194
- Which would mean that I falied ...
- Ohhh!

19:54.763 --> 19:57.151
Looks like somebody needs
a big hug right now.

20:03.377 --> 20:04.999
OK You know what! Look

20:05.601 --> 20:07.285
Miley I'm sorry you
didn't get the part.

20:07.755 --> 20:11.525
I mean let's face it. You'll get the
next one. And the next one after that.

20:12.061 --> 20:14.008
And I'm not sure I can
be around that anymore.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.841
What!

20:17.004 --> 20:20.560
I poured ice water down
Rob Reiner's shirt for you

20:20.593 --> 20:23.460
and you don't know if you can
"be around that" anymore?

20:23.784 --> 20:24.837
You what?

20:24.985 --> 20:26.836
She the audition Oliver.

20:26.853 --> 20:27.837
You what!

20:27.960 --> 20:30.058
I gave up Indiana Joannie
so you would stay my friend.

20:30.175 --> 20:31.011
You what!

20:31.065 --> 20:34.292
But if you say 'you what' again.
Ice water's going down your pants.

20:37.601 --> 20:39.008
Well thanks a lot!

20:39.085 --> 20:41.024
OK I'm lost.
What's the problem now?

20:41.370 --> 20:42.975
Miley I'll tell you
what the problem is.

20:43.688 --> 20:47.124
I mean how am I supposed to walk away from
someone who would do something like that
for me?

20:48.743 --> 20:49.722
I guess you're not?

20:53.850 --> 20:55.388
Ohhh!

20:56.291 --> 21:01.329
So you promise you won't get upset the next
time that I get something and you don't?

21:01.383 --> 21:02.322
Sure I will.

21:02.776 --> 21:07.837
And it'll be hard... but you know not as
nearly as hard as loosing a friend like you.

21:08.197 --> 21:10.079
Double ohh.

21:11.636 --> 21:13.617
You gave up the part
of a lifetime for me?

21:13.763 --> 21:14.367
I know.

21:15.054 --> 21:17.094
Miley this could've
made you a movie star.

21:17.467 --> 21:18.298
I know.

21:18.388 --> 21:20.740
And you know what I just heard
that cast Chace Crawford as Eddie.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.166
I... huh?

21:22.237 --> 21:24.706
Nothing! Friends. Hug?

21:26.186 --> 21:28.025
- Get Rob Reiner on the phone now!
- Already on it.

21:34.121 --> 21:38.914
Rico... Rico!

21:42.002 --> 21:44.977
Why did you do this to me?

21:46.235 --> 21:47.989
Very funny Jackson.

21:47.877 --> 21:50.232
Jackson's not here.

21:51.623 --> 21:53.821
Yeah right. Jackson...

21:56.256 --> 21:57.215
Oh boy!

22:02.253 --> 22:03.367
Who's the dummy now?

22:03.528 --> 22:04.361
Rico! What are you doing?

22:06.253 --> 22:07.535
He attacked me!

22:09.129 --> 22:13.381
Wow. Somebody's got
a guilty conscious.

22:15.476 --> 22:15.969
Later dude.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.671
Round two?

22:25.459 --> 22:27.258
You're going down Chucky!
