WEBVTT

00:08.048 --> 00:13.169
Though washing one's hands 20 to 30
times a day IS obsessive-compulsive,

00:13.555 --> 00:18.549
please bear in mind
that your husband is a coroner.

00:21.438 --> 00:25.397
Thank you for your call.
Roz, whom do we have next?

00:25.734 --> 00:29.329
Ethan is having a problem at school.

00:29.654 --> 00:33.203
- Hello, Ethan. I'm listening.
- 'Hi, Dr Crane.'

00:33.533 --> 00:37.890
- How old are you?
- 'I'm 13.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.202
'I'm having problems
with the other kids.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.607
They're always beating me up.'

00:42.876 --> 00:45.265
Why do you think that's so?

00:45.545 --> 00:47.820
'Because I'm smart. I have a 160 IQ.

00:48.089 --> 00:50.922
'I'm in the astronomy club
and I hate sports.'

00:51.217 --> 00:56.211
Well, the other children are just
acting out of jealousy and immaturity.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.953
I know it doesn't help much now

00:59.225 --> 01:03.696
but the day will come
when you will have the last laugh.

01:04.813 --> 01:07.123
'That's it?'

01:08.693 --> 01:10.649
Yes.

01:10.904 --> 01:15.773
'l find that advice patronising,
simplistic and uninspired.

01:16.159 --> 01:21.187
'The real surprise here is they pay you
to dole out this balloon juice.'

01:23.083 --> 01:26.120
- Ethan, where are you calling from?
- 'Home.'

01:26.419 --> 01:29.297
If any of Ethan's
classmates are listening...

01:30.924 --> 01:33.996
...you know where he is,
and he can't stay there forever.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.145
Thank you for your call.

01:40.433 --> 01:45.632
That's about it for today. This is
Frasier Crane KACL talk radio, 780AM.

01:49.025 --> 01:53.303
- That was a pretty good show, eh?
- Sure, whatever you say.

01:53.655 --> 01:58.251
- Got another one of your hot dates?
- If you must know, yes.

01:58.618 --> 02:02.930
- Pick you up outside in five minutes?
- Great. Thanks, Noel.

02:08.211 --> 02:12.966
Noel? Noel Shemsky from Sales?
That's who your date is with?

02:13.341 --> 02:15.696
We're just having a drink.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.119
Noel, the Mole?

02:18.388 --> 02:22.939
I know he's not great-looking,
I know he drives a '73 Dodge Polaris,

02:23.309 --> 02:28.019
but he's always struck me
as a really interesting guy.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.037
The world's full of superficial guys.

02:31.317 --> 02:35.993
He's got a good heart,
he's smart, he's substantial,

02:36.364 --> 02:40.960
and considering my track record lately,
I'd expect your support.

02:41.327 --> 02:46.196
Does Noel still have that autographed
picture of Captain Kirk in his cubicle?

02:47.417 --> 02:49.851
Why do I tell you anything?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.642
Knock, knock!
Can I be of any assistance?

02:56.926 --> 03:00.202
Oh, no thank you.
I have everything under control.

03:00.513 --> 03:04.426
Mind if I linger? I've always been
sort of a kitchen person.

03:05.477 --> 03:08.150
Suit yourself. I like the company.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.396
So how is Dad's therapy going?

03:11.691 --> 03:15.843
We can see more mobility in his hip
and his flexibility is improving,

03:16.196 --> 03:19.711
but it's a chore
to get him to do his exercises.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.662
But if I bribe him with sweets...

03:23.995 --> 03:26.873
Oh, my goodness!

03:27.165 --> 03:29.520
Oh, Dr Crane!

03:32.712 --> 03:35.351
Dr Crane, can you get up?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.987
No, I'll stay here for a few minutes.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.409
Niles, what are you doing?

03:40.679 --> 03:44.797
- He conked his head on the hood.
- You are shameless!

03:45.141 --> 03:49.532
I have a sore head and a crackerjack
lawyer, so don't crowd me.

03:50.689 --> 03:55.001
- Here, put this on it.
- You've been wonderful in this crisis.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.909
Oh, come on, Camille.
I need to talk to you.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.436
I'm having a young lady over on Friday.

04:02.742 --> 04:06.178
- Could you take Dad out?
- I wish you'd said Saturday.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.374
You have plans Friday?
- No, I have plans Saturday.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.418
Please.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.820
Oh, all right. So, does this mean
you're hoping to get lucky?

04:16.172 --> 04:20.404
Please, nobody refers to having sex
as "getting lucky" any more.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.354
I do.

04:24.305 --> 04:27.183
- Hello, boys.
- (Both) Hi, Dad.

04:27.475 --> 04:32.595
Would you like to join
Maris and me Friday night?

04:32.981 --> 04:36.894
We're dying to try
the new rib joint on Bellevue Way.

04:37.235 --> 04:41.547
If the onion rings aren't as big
as your head, you get them for free.

04:42.991 --> 04:48.349
Thanks, but I thought I'd just spend
a quiet evening at home.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.545
Oh, well...
Why don't you come to our house?

04:51.833 --> 04:55.951
We'll make dinner and we'll even rent
an Angie Dickinson film.

04:56.296 --> 05:00.653
What's going on? Frasier wants me
out of here because he's got a date?

05:01.009 --> 05:04.843
I'm sorry,
he sees things that others don't.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.695
I should have asked you myself.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.728
I'll clear out, but remember,

05:12.020 --> 05:14.580
one hand washes the other
around here.

05:14.856 --> 05:19.566
- What does that mean?
- You can clear out for me Thursday.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.617
I got a date with Elaine in 1412.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.818
How long has this been going on?

05:26.117 --> 05:30.747
She's had me over for coffee.
I'd like to have her over for dinner.

05:31.873 --> 05:35.183
Niles, wipe that stupid smirk
off your face.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.838
- What do you say?
- Terrific.

05:39.130 --> 05:43.760
If there's a lull in the conversation
we've got board games, playing cards.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.171
Does she play Canasta?

05:46.429 --> 05:50.502
And PBS has a documentary on
the swing bands of the '30s and '40s.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.846
Thanks, boys.

05:54.104 --> 05:58.143
We'll have creamed corn,
rub liniment into each other's joints...

05:58.483 --> 06:01.600
and fall asleep drooling on the couch.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.188
(Frasier) Morning, Daphne.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.488
Morning. I want to thank you again
for the show last night.

06:10.829 --> 06:15.027
I've never been
to experimental theatre before.

06:15.375 --> 06:21.086
What did it mean when the naked man
came in carrying the suitcase?

06:23.216 --> 06:27.095
Well, I think it meant
that he packed too much.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.547
I'm sure your father
was glad to have us out.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.842
What is that heavenly aroma?

06:35.145 --> 06:38.581
Traditional English breakfast.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.573
We have eggs
and bangers, or sausages,

06:42.902 --> 06:46.417
and a batch
of Grammy Moon's famous sticky buns.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.651
Oh, my, that's it!

06:48.908 --> 06:52.537
Grammy used to add
a pint of rum to the recipe

06:52.871 --> 06:56.181
and nobody liked these
more than Grammy.

06:56.499 --> 07:01.129
I'd go to her house and find her
out in the garden in a wedding dress

07:01.504 --> 07:04.337
face down in the birdbath.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.748
- Morning!
- Morning, Dad.

07:07.010 --> 07:10.161
So...how was your date last night?

07:10.472 --> 07:14.829
It feels strange, a son asking his father
how his date was last night...

07:16.603 --> 07:19.356
...when he could ask the date herself.

07:20.648 --> 07:24.766
Elaine, this is Daphne,
my son Frasier. This is Elaine Morris.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.608
- Yes, hello.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.908
I know Dad's wanted
to have you for a long time.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.443
I mean for dinner.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.065
Well, I certainly enjoyed it.
But I should be going.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.577
No, you should at least
stay for breakfast.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.477
I could stay for coffee.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.400
(Frasier) Splendid, splendid.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.026
What did you two kids do last night?

07:57.310 --> 08:01.223
Did you play some games?
I mean, board games.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.237
Not that you were bored...or excited.
Well...

08:04.526 --> 08:08.155
Not that I'd know anything or should,
but... Warm buns, Elaine.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.446
No, not yours. I mean, ours, to eat.

08:11.741 --> 08:15.336
Here, I'll have one. Mmm... Warm.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.139
- Let's go sit at the table.
- OK.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.666
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I don't know!

08:24.963 --> 08:30.640
Frasier, I love your show. My friends
and I listen to it almost every day.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.087
That's always lovely to hear.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.485
(Awkward silence)

08:40.895 --> 08:45.491
- Elaine's a buyer at Bon MarchÃ©.
- I do a great deal of shopping there.

08:45.859 --> 08:50.694
I bought the comforter on Dad's bed.
I suppose you noticed that. Well...

08:52.574 --> 08:58.206
I don't know if you had the lights on or...
I don't know how you like it.

08:58.621 --> 09:03.092
I mean, well, how you... light it.
Well, how you like to light it.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.180
Oh, banger, Dad?

09:10.800 --> 09:14.554
I really should be going.
I've got to get ready for work.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.881
It was nice meeting you, Daphne,
and, uh, Frasier.

09:19.225 --> 09:23.013
- Thanks for a lovely evening, Martin.
- I'll call you later.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.949
You couldn't have served bacon?

09:26.232 --> 09:28.666
Me? The way you were carrying on

09:28.943 --> 09:32.333
we can be thankful
I didn't make toad in the hole.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.032
You handled that smoothly, Dr Crane.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.558
I'm sorry, Dad.
It just caught me off guard.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.369
Oh, that's OK,
I should have warned you, but...

09:45.710 --> 09:49.623
But I really didn't think
it was going to happen.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.321
Pretty glad it did.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.280
- So you like Elaine?
- I like Elaine.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.009
- So, Dad...?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.227
You're back on the beat!

10:10.527 --> 10:12.483
All right!

10:12.737 --> 10:15.615
- Lock up your daughters!
- Yeah, OK.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.898
- Oh, come on, you old...
- Frasier, don't push it!

10:22.414 --> 10:26.885
We have Marianne on line 4,
she's concerned about her daughter.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.050
Hello, Marianne. I'm listening.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.294
'Kids, you can't live with them,

10:32.549 --> 10:35.666
'you can't shove them
back in the womb.'

10:37.220 --> 10:41.099
Well, as we try to forget
the image that summons up...

10:42.517 --> 10:44.712
...how can I help you?

10:44.978 --> 10:49.449
'My 22-year-old arrived home
for a visit with her boyfriend.

10:49.816 --> 10:53.491
'l insisted they sleep
in separate bedrooms.

10:53.820 --> 10:58.052
'She got furious. She's been upset with
me all week. Am I out of line here?'

10:58.408 --> 11:03.118
- In your house you make up the rules.
- 'Thank you.'

11:03.496 --> 11:07.125
But isn't there
something else here?

11:07.459 --> 11:12.055
Perhaps you find it hard
to think of your daughter as an adult.

11:12.422 --> 11:16.734
We all freeze people in roles
with which we are most comfortable,

11:17.093 --> 11:20.529
especially when it comes
to that old bugaboo, sex.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.361
Take me as an example.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.360
My 63-year-old father

11:26.644 --> 11:29.158
moved in with me
and this morning, over coffee,

11:29.439 --> 11:33.910
I discovered he had spent the night
with a delightful creature named Elaine.

11:34.277 --> 11:40.989
It completely unnerved me
as I had never thought of my father

11:41.451 --> 11:43.760
as a man with normal sexual urges.

11:44.037 --> 11:49.111
To me, he was always just "Dad".
Well, that's absurd.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.299
He is a witty, virile, charming man,

11:52.587 --> 11:56.216
possessed with the hereditary
Crane good looks.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.904
What I'm driving at is that sexuality

11:59.177 --> 12:03.250
is a healthy part
of adulthood at any age.

12:03.598 --> 12:06.271
It's time we embraced that, right?

12:06.559 --> 12:10.393
'Sorry, I've got to go. I'm hearing noises
from the guest room.'

12:10.730 --> 12:14.689
As Marianne rushes to the guest room
with a bucket of ice water,

12:15.026 --> 12:18.302
we will pause for these messages.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.387
- That was a good show.
- Thank you.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.535
- Hi, Dr Crane. Hi, Roz.
- Hi, Noel.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.982
- I had a great time last night.
- Me, too.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.726
I made you this spice rack.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.587
I specially treated the back
for easy wall adhesion.

12:42.846 --> 12:45.679
That was very thoughtful of you, Noel.

12:45.974 --> 12:49.728
Well, um... I got to run.
I'll call you later.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.291
Live long and prosper.

12:55.483 --> 12:59.874
Oh, look, there's a place for cumin.
Most people overlook that.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.188
Just kill me.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.124
Why would he say it on the radio?

13:08.413 --> 13:11.450
When you get angry,
your ears turn red.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.177
See, there they go.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.521
Good evening everyone.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.392
I'll be going to me room right now.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.760
Hello, Eddie.

13:31.478 --> 13:35.994
- I seem to have cleared the room.
- I want to talk to you, mister.

13:36.358 --> 13:39.077
And take me out behind the woodshed?

13:39.361 --> 13:43.274
Why were you talking about
my personal life on your programme?

13:43.615 --> 13:47.574
- You mean about you and Elaine?
- Damn right! I was so embarrassed!

13:47.911 --> 13:49.902
It was flattering.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.599
Yeah, telling Seattle about me
shacking up with a neighbour.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.477
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.

13:56.753 --> 14:00.382
Knock it off.
Elaine won't even talk to me any more.

14:00.715 --> 14:04.390
What for?
Simply because of a harmless remark?

14:04.719 --> 14:08.507
People of our generation
think that sex is a private thing.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.237
That's a healthy way of looking at it.

14:11.518 --> 14:15.193
Sex is something between you
and the person you're doing it to!

14:20.193 --> 14:23.549
Don't you think
she's overreacting a little?

14:23.863 --> 14:30.211
She spends the night. Next,
it's being broadcast all over Seattle.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.176
I mean,
her friends heard it and called her.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.766
She won't go out
or answer the phone.

14:37.085 --> 14:40.157
- I'm sorry.
- Your sympathy touches me (!)

14:40.463 --> 14:43.136
I caused the problem,
so I'll take care of it.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.383
I'll be in my room holding my breath.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.900
I said I'd take care of it.

14:59.441 --> 15:02.194
(Man drones on) 'l hate my voice.

15:02.485 --> 15:07.764
'l know no one likes the sound
of their own voice, especially on tape,

15:08.158 --> 15:12.231
'it doesn't sound as good
as in their own head.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.298
'But I hate my voice in my head, too.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.938
'You can't get away
from your own voice.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.528
'l tried not listening to myself
when I talk,

15:22.839 --> 15:27.435
'but then I say things
that don't make a lot of sense.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.521
'l hate my voice so much,

15:30.805 --> 15:36.482
'l had to call a neighbour in to do the
message on my answering machine.

15:36.895 --> 15:41.605
'l don't like his voice much either
but it's better than mine.

15:41.983 --> 15:45.293
'Not that I get a lot of calls, anyway.
Go figure.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.410
'Any advice, Dr Crane?'

15:49.616 --> 15:54.644
Just go on with what you're doing
and everything should turn out all right.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.102
Thank you for your call.

15:59.709 --> 16:04.624
Oh, I'd like to end today's show
on something of a personal note.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.236
I'm talking to one person
in my audience.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.182
Elaine.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.986
You wouldn't answer my phone calls,
so I hope you're listening.

16:16.226 --> 16:20.105
I want to apologise
for what I said on the radio.

16:20.438 --> 16:24.147
I took something private
and made it public.

16:24.484 --> 16:28.272
I will never do that again,
well, except for this time.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.081
Then I promise I'll never do it again.

16:31.366 --> 16:36.645
The saddest thing is, Elaine,
Dad is paying for my mistake.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.080
(# "Moon River" plays)

16:49.884 --> 16:51.840
Elaine,

16:53.555 --> 16:57.673
Martin cares for you
and he misses you very much.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.398
More than anything,
he'd like to be back together with you.

17:03.732 --> 17:08.362
And if you feel the same,
I hope you'll find it in your heart

17:08.737 --> 17:12.695
to come to my place tonight
at 8:00 for dinner...

17:13.032 --> 17:17.071
a very romantic dinner.
Thanks, Elaine.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.743
This is KACL-780AM, talk radio,

17:23.084 --> 17:28.681
and I'm Frasier Crane...
The lo-ove doctor.

17:33.887 --> 17:37.004
(Frasier) # Moon river... #

17:37.307 --> 17:41.459
The champagne is chilled,
a platter of hors d'Åuvres...

17:41.811 --> 17:45.690
- The roast looks beautiful.
- I hope this works.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.902
I've been sending Elaine
psychic messages.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.721
You can transmit?
I thought you were just a receiver.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.262
I'm giving it a try.

17:56.534 --> 18:01.403
You know: "Elaine in 1410,
come to dinner, come to dinner."

18:01.790 --> 18:04.907
That's very charming,
but Elaine is in 1412.

18:05.210 --> 18:08.566
I'd better set an extra place
at the table, then.

18:08.880 --> 18:14.557
- It's 8:00 and I'm still a pumpkin.
- It is two minutes to 8:00. Relax.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.722
She probably didn't hear your show.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.450
- Does this tie go with the jacket?
- You look smashing.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.123
Who am I kidding? She won't show up.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.307
(Doorbell)

18:26.564 --> 18:29.158
Let's skip the first course,
which is crow,

18:29.442 --> 18:31.398
and start with the hors d'Åuvres.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.689
Just answer the door.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.100
Is this the Crane residence?

18:39.369 --> 18:43.328
- Yes, it is.
- We've been here for 15 minutes.

18:43.665 --> 18:47.374
- Did Elaine show up or not?
- Who are you?

18:47.711 --> 18:52.910
We heard your show, so romantic!
We all have our fingers crossed.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.733
- That's kind.
- I'm Marjorie from 11,

18:56.011 --> 19:00.163
this is Norman,
these other people I don't know.

19:00.515 --> 19:02.471
Nice to see you all.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.479
Tony,
shouldn't you be watching the door?

19:05.770 --> 19:10.321
We're all locked in.
I must find out how this ends, Doc.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.650
- What's going on out here?
- Oh, is this Martin?

19:13.945 --> 19:16.015
(Crowd) Oh!

19:16.281 --> 19:18.237
People,
don't you have lives of your own?

19:18.491 --> 19:21.449
Please, scoot! It's a private situation.

19:21.745 --> 19:24.134
(Elevator bell)

19:25.332 --> 19:28.244
- That's her!
- Oh, my God!

19:28.543 --> 19:31.455
- Please, come out.
- No!

19:31.755 --> 19:37.227
Dad, you come in here. OK, back off!
Just give us some time! Please!

19:37.635 --> 19:41.071
I should never have come up.
Nothing's changed.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.187
- Let me explain.
- You've done enough.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.865
- Frasier, over there.
- Dad...

19:47.145 --> 19:49.864
- Turn around.
- Well, I...

19:50.148 --> 19:52.218
Ah!

19:54.277 --> 19:58.429
I'm sorry about what happened.
You've got every right to be mad.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.338
What we had was pretty good.

20:02.619 --> 20:06.737
And thanks to radio boy here,
most of Seattle agrees with me.

20:07.082 --> 20:10.791
I'd hate us to lose it
because of one stupid thing.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.081
Come on, Elaine.

20:14.339 --> 20:18.048
I had a great time on our date.
Don't you feel the same way?

20:19.177 --> 20:23.295
You may not remember
but I have warm toes.

20:27.394 --> 20:32.422
It's your choice, but I sure wish
you'd come and have dinner with me.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.046

Who said you could turn around?

20:54.337 --> 20:56.453
Look, it's coming back up!

20:57.424 --> 20:59.858
(Crowd) Oh!

21:01.469 --> 21:06.782
All right, you've had your fun.
Show is over. Go back to your homes.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.139
Please folks.
Honour what the man says.

21:09.394 --> 21:12.113
Thank you so much for your concern.

21:12.397 --> 21:16.185
Let's expedite this departure,
if you would. Thank you so much.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.278
Goodbye.

21:18.528 --> 21:23.477
- We should give them their privacy.
- Yes, I suppose you're right.

21:23.867 --> 21:27.416
It's ironic: my 63-year-old father

21:27.746 --> 21:30.180
is about to embark
on a night of romance,

21:30.457 --> 21:36.805
while the two of us, a man and woman,
both attractive and eligible,

21:37.255 --> 21:41.089
in the prime of our lives,
with nothing to do on a Saturday night.

21:42.344 --> 21:46.383
The answer to our problems
might be right under our noses.

21:47.891 --> 21:50.166
Yes, Daphne, I think it is.

21:50.435 --> 21:54.872
All right, you go claim the washing
machines. I'll go get the laundry.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.194
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling

22:07.452 --> 22:10.250
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:10.538 --> 22:12.017
# Mercy!

22:12.248 --> 22:14.557
# And maybe I seem a bit confused

22:14.834 --> 22:17.109
# Yeah, maybe, but I got you pegged!

22:19.381 --> 22:21.178
# But I don't know what to do with those

22:21.424 --> 22:24.257
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:26.346 --> 22:28.940
# They're calling again

22:29.224 --> 22:33.183
# Scrambled eggs all over my face
What is a boy to do? #

22:35.897 --> 22:37.216
Thank you!
