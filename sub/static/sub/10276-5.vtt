The Duchess Matilda's manor.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.836
Thank you. Wow. I've never been
to Aunt Tilly's before.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.572
Oh, and look at
that gargoyle.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.641
And that one.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.309
And that one.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.711
They're so ugly,
they're cute.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.884
Aunt Tilly, I'm here.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.353
Aunt Tilly?

01:28.355 --> 01:30.689
I heard you
the first time.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.858
Sofia!

01:32.860 --> 01:35.794
My, you're growing
like a seed in sunshine.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.596
It's good to see you,
Aunt Tilly.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.864
Likewise, my dear.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.666
Thank you for coming
to help me set up

01:40.668 --> 01:42.868
for my garden party.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.671
I was just about
to feed my fish.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.706
Open their door for me,
won't you, dear?

01:47.708 --> 01:49.808
Why do you keep fish
in a birdcage?

01:49.810 --> 01:51.810
Oh! Aunt Tilly!

01:51.812 --> 01:54.680
That's okay,
that's okay.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.949
It's good to let them
get out and flap their fins.

01:56.951 --> 01:59.751
All right, come on.
Here we go, back you go.

01:59.753 --> 02:00.953
You, too. Come on.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.689
Oh!

02:03.691 --> 02:06.758
Oh! Fish food
on the floor.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.827
That won't do at all.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.698
- Who are you?
- I am Spruce.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.766
I make sure the manor
is in tip-top shape

02:14.768 --> 02:16.735
at all times.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.637
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Spruce.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.640
The pleasure is mine
entirely.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.712
Shall we get things ready
for the party now, my dear?

02:26.714 --> 02:28.714
Sure, Aunt Tilly.
What do we need to do?

02:28.716 --> 02:30.849
It's all right here.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.918
"Tie balloons
to the mailbox."

02:32.920 --> 02:34.720
I already
blew them up for you.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.955
"Pick fresh vases
for the flowers"?

02:36.957 --> 02:39.858
The flowers get tired
of the same old vases.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.860
You can get new ones
in the vase closet.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.795
"Take the rug
for a walk"?

02:43.797 --> 02:45.931
Yep. All you do is...

02:48.869 --> 02:49.868
Not yet, dear.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.871
( whimpers )

02:52.873 --> 02:54.806
And tidy up the house,

02:54.808 --> 02:56.408
especially
the music room.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.743
Where is the music room?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.678
Right this way.

03:09.756 --> 03:10.989
What's this?

03:10.991 --> 03:12.758
I'm a magical
music box.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.726
Oh. You talk.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.762
And pirouette.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.731
And a few other things
that I can't remember
right now.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.733
She's a little forgetful.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.002
- I am?
- But her hearing's
still good.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.839
And she plays
all these magical music rolls.

03:27.841 --> 03:28.907
What makes them magical?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.909
I'll show you.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.779
Each of them plays
a song that makes
something magical happen.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.914
We just put one in
the music box,

03:35.916 --> 03:38.050
and let the fun begin.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.725

And if that doesn't
tickle your toes,

03:51.732 --> 03:54.866
- each roll does
something different.
- Hmm.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.070
Okay, dear, I'm
going out to get
the snickerdoodle sandwiches

setting up together.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.049
We are, just not in
the same place.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.951
Spruce will be here

left in charge before,

06:16.877 --> 06:18.643
Thanks, Aunt Tilly.

06:18.645 --> 06:21.213
Well, Mr. Spruce,
we better get the house
set up for the party.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.949
I don't wanna let
Aunt Tilly down.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.051
Ready when you are.
( giggles )

06:31.157 --> 06:32.257
There.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.095
Oh! That's a lot
of balloons.

06:37.097 --> 06:40.165
Mr. Spruce, look.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.134
It's a secret tunnel.

06:42.136 --> 06:45.103
It can use a thorough
cleaning from the looks of it.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.973
- Let's see where it goes.
- I'll clean the way.

06:50.209 --> 06:53.979
Thought you could hide from
the dust master, did you?

06:59.185 --> 07:02.154
Oh, there's
no way out.

07:02.156 --> 07:04.122
Don't be so sure.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.927
A trapdoor!

07:09.695 --> 07:11.696
And a secret
passageway.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.231
After you, Princess.

07:18.938 --> 07:22.174
Huh. I wonder why Aunt Tilly
has a secret passageway.

07:22.176 --> 07:25.043
Your Aunt Tilly
has lots of strange things.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.012
Most of them messy.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.114
Let's tidy up
the music room next.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.249
Then we'll pick the vases
and take the rug for a walk.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.218
Ooh, delightful.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.289
I'm going to put another
roll in the music box

07:37.291 --> 07:39.057
while we clean.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.092
Splendid idea, Princess.

07:41.094 --> 07:44.062
What kind of magic does
this green roll make,
Miss Ballerina?

07:44.064 --> 07:47.299
Oh, that one's
very special, Princess.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.234
It... it...

07:49.236 --> 07:52.003
Oh, twirl my tutu,
I can't remember.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.506
( giggles ) It's okay.
Let's find out.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.178
( playing sweet melody )

08:23.302 --> 08:25.237
Oh, yeah!

08:25.239 --> 08:28.039
Feels good to stretch
the old wings.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.342
( whooping )

08:34.046 --> 08:37.048
We're free!

08:37.050 --> 08:39.150
Watch where you're
flappin', Gunk.

08:39.152 --> 08:42.020
Sorry, Muck.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.355
( yells )

08:43.357 --> 08:45.323
Almost forgot how to fly.

08:45.325 --> 08:48.360
We're flesh and slime
again.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.363
Hey, fellas,
it's been too long.

08:53.099 --> 08:55.066
Calm down, will ya?

08:55.068 --> 08:57.769
It's just a very exciting
time for us.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.337
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

08:59.339 --> 09:02.040
but I'm tired of standing
on the house.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.210
I say it's time
we move inside the house.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.145
BOTH: Yeah!

09:07.147 --> 09:09.080
Let's start packing...

09:09.082 --> 09:11.216
Uh, wait, we don't
have any stuff, do we?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.084
Listen up, Gunk.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.187
First, we gotta make sure
we get that magical
music box

09:16.189 --> 09:19.124
before they play a song
that turns us back to stone.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.325
Good point.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.294
First we get
the music box,

09:22.296 --> 09:24.296
then we take the house!

09:24.298 --> 09:27.299
And then the fun
really starts.

09:27.301 --> 09:30.168
Let's fly, boyos!

09:31.337 --> 09:33.371
Single file, guys.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.140
Single file.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.342
After you, Muck.

09:37.344 --> 09:41.279
That's weird. The song ended,
but nothing happened.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.181
( scratching sounds )

09:43.183 --> 09:45.250
Wait. Do you hear that?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.285
( scratching continues )

09:47.287 --> 09:49.154
What's that sound?

09:49.156 --> 09:51.856
All right, boys, let's find
a way into this joint.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.224
What is that?

09:53.226 --> 09:55.226
A gargoyle!

09:55.228 --> 09:57.429
Oh, yes, now
I remember.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.365
The green roll turns
the stone gargoyles

10:00.367 --> 10:02.867
into real gargoyles.

10:02.869 --> 10:06.271
Green roll,
green gargoyles.

10:06.273 --> 10:10.175
No, no, no, no!

10:10.177 --> 10:12.177
We can't let them
in, Sofia.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.412
They'll slime up
the whole house.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.214
Oh, no.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.449
SPRUCE: Lock the windows,
quick.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.118
Go away.

10:22.321 --> 10:25.156
Nice try, troublemaker.

10:27.226 --> 10:30.195
- Cut it out, girlie.
- You cut it out.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.430
- I told you to cut it out.
- ( both struggling )

10:34.266 --> 10:36.301
So that's how
it's gonna be.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.402
This-a-way, boys.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.404
They're trying to find
another way in.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.239
Lock the door.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.341
MUCK: Let's go around
the front.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.477
GUNK : The front door's
wide open.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.146
We're in!
No, we're not.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.148
That should
keep them out.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.283
The chimney.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.220
( goofy laughter )

10:55.222 --> 10:57.288
What's that noise?

11:01.228 --> 11:06.231
( gasps )
And I just swept
the chimney.

11:06.233 --> 11:09.234
I'm stuck.

11:10.503 --> 11:14.239
All right, gents,
find me that music box.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.241
Wait, why again?

11:16.243 --> 11:18.309
So no one can turn us
back to stone,

11:18.311 --> 11:20.245
like I just told ya.

11:20.247 --> 11:23.214
The music box can
turn them back to stone?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.449
We better not
let them get it.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.484
Okay, you distract them
while I figure out

11:26.486 --> 11:28.420
how to turn them back.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.321
Roger that.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.924
Listen up,
you slimy brutes.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.326
As hobgoblin
of this manor,

11:35.328 --> 11:38.329
I insist you leave
at once.

11:38.331 --> 11:42.534
How about we insist
you leave at once?

11:42.536 --> 11:46.471
Prepare to receive
the cleaning of your lives.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.473
Get him, boys.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.543
En garde, you troublesome
troublemakers.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.411
First I'll tickle you.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.547
( laughing )

11:55.549 --> 11:58.483
Then I'll dust you.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.353
SPRUCE: Hurry up, Sofia.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.989
Miss Ballerina, can you
turn the gargoyles
back to stone?

12:04.991 --> 12:07.292
Yes. Yes, I can.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.960
There's a music roll
that will turn
the gargoyles

12:08.962 --> 12:10.462
back to stone.

12:10.464 --> 12:12.530
Which one?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.399
It's the...

12:14.401 --> 12:16.401
Oh, plié,
I can't remember.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.437
Is it the silver one?

12:19.439 --> 12:20.572
- No.
- The gold one?

12:20.574 --> 12:22.407
I don't think so.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.276
All right, fellas,
give him the slime.

12:27.379 --> 12:30.448
Not me, him.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.516
Is it the red one?

12:31.518 --> 12:33.551
- No.
- The blue one?

12:33.553 --> 12:36.554
Oh, pink point shoes.
I just can't remember.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.990
There's so many, I don't
know which one to pick.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.326
Got it.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.527
- BALLERINA: Sofia!
- SOFIA: No!

12:42.529 --> 12:44.295
Mr. Spruce!

12:45.464 --> 12:47.298
Check it out, fellas.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.535
- All right, Muck!
- SPRUCE: Unhand that.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.504
Give that music box back,
Mr. Gargoyle.

12:52.506 --> 12:54.339
It's Aunt Tilly's.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.541
( laughs )
Not anymore, it ain't.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.443
And neither is the house.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.312
Show 'em out,
will you, Gunk?

13:01.314 --> 13:05.316
You got it.
Right this way.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.386
- SOFIA: Mr. Spruce,
I can't stop.
- Me either.

13:08.388 --> 13:12.657
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Princess.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.596
It's locked.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.566
They locked it.
Can you open the door?

13:21.568 --> 13:25.503
I am the door knocker,
not the door opener.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.472
Oh!

13:27.474 --> 13:30.575
- The windows
are all locked.
- Thanks to us.

13:30.577 --> 13:34.512
Hey. Hey!
Get your slimy feet
off the sofa, you.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.381
Let me in!

13:36.383 --> 13:38.349
I'm in charge here.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.318
Aunt Tilly trusted me
to take care of the house.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.389
Well, it looks like
she trusted the wrong princess.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.457
Make yourselves
at home, boys.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.593
Ah, pretty music box.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.095
Ooh, let's play
another song!

13:51.097 --> 13:55.400
One of those songs will turn us
back to stone, remember?

13:55.402 --> 13:56.534
Let's play one anyway.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.337
I can't trust
either of you guys.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.507
The only way we'll be safe
is if we break the music box.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.375
Break the music box?!

14:04.377 --> 14:05.510
Break the music box?

14:05.512 --> 14:08.479
Yeah! Break the music box!

14:08.481 --> 14:11.082
Uh... how we gonna
do that, Muck?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.483
I have no idea.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.118
Start thinkin', boys.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.520
Aw, do we have to?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.423
Help! Sofia, help!

14:18.425 --> 14:22.427
Mr. Spruce,
Aunt Tilly's going
to be so upset with me.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.628
I messed up everything.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.496
Oh, Princess Sofia,

14:25.498 --> 14:27.599
your Aunt Tilly would not
have left you in charge

14:27.601 --> 14:31.402
if she thought you
couldn't handle a few
little problems.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.137
A few little problems?

14:33.139 --> 14:36.107
Those are more like big,
giant, slimy problems.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.575
Oh, true.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.510
But what did the duchess
say you should do

14:39.512 --> 14:41.512
when problems arise?

14:41.514 --> 14:44.582
Did she say to fret
and fuss and throw in
the dish towel?

14:44.584 --> 14:48.453
No. She said to fix them,
but how?

14:48.455 --> 14:51.456
You're the one
in charge, Princess.
You tell me.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.458
Okay, fellas, pull.

14:55.527 --> 14:57.595
Oh, that's great.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.497
I need a good stretch.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.402
All right, boys.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.170
Start thinkin' of
another plan.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.705
Aw, we gotta think again?

15:07.707 --> 15:09.440
Okay, okay.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.509
- I can fix this.
- I'm all ears.

15:11.511 --> 15:15.413
First, we need to find
a way back inside the house.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.415
Then, if we're
really quiet,

15:17.417 --> 15:20.184
you can sneak up
and grab the music box.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.487
I am a master of stealth.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.455
While I figure out
which music roll

15:24.457 --> 15:25.690
will turn them
back to stone.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.558
'Tis a good plan,
Princess.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.427
But how will we
get in the house

15:29.429 --> 15:30.762
when everything's locked?

15:30.764 --> 15:32.563
Um... ( gasps )

15:32.565 --> 15:34.465
The tunnel. I never
closed it up.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.200
Come on.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.636
Now I see why Aunt Tilly
has a secret passageway.

15:38.638 --> 15:42.640
It is time to clean house.

15:45.744 --> 15:48.446
I know how
to smash that music box.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.614
Give me a screwdriver.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.683
Come on, Mr. Spruce.
Let's go.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.451
MUCK: Not by that end.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.719
Careful they don't
see us.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.455
Right.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.723
There we go.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.195
This'll fling the box
right into the wall,

16:04.197 --> 16:06.531
and ka-blooey!

16:06.533 --> 16:07.732
( Ballerina screaming )

16:07.734 --> 16:09.667
We've got to save her.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.803
ALL: Ready, aim...

16:11.805 --> 16:14.772
Fire! Hey!

16:14.774 --> 16:16.708
Sorry, Muck.

16:18.211 --> 16:23.514
We've had just about
enough of you, hobgoblin.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.784
I assure you,
the feeling is quite mutual.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.220
Lookin' for this?

16:29.222 --> 16:30.822
Now give us
that music box.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.725
Hey. Go get 'em, fish.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.761
Let's go, let's go!

16:36.763 --> 16:38.596
Get 'em off me!

16:38.598 --> 16:40.832
- Do something.
- You do something!

16:43.535 --> 16:45.703
Which one is it?

16:45.705 --> 16:48.773
This one feels like
it's made of stone.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.708
Green roll,
green gargoyles.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.644
Stone roll,
stone gargoyles.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.613
If the green roll
made them come to life,

16:55.615 --> 16:57.849
maybe the stone roll
turns them back to stone.

17:00.786 --> 17:03.721
Mr. Spruce, I found
the right roll.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.556
No!

17:11.563 --> 17:13.798
Ha! I've got
the music box,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.733
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.635
Okay, rug, it's time
for your walk.

17:19.738 --> 17:22.840
Time for a new song.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.878
Wait. No, let's
talk about this.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.279
No, no, no!

17:28.281 --> 17:30.615
( music begins playing )

17:38.690 --> 17:41.626
Well played, Princess.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.661
Oh, thank you,
Princess Sofia.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.731
You saved my tutu.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.768
You certainly showed
those gargoyle's
who's in charge.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.670
I guess I did.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.606
Oh, but this place
is such a mess.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.575
I can't let Aunt Tilly
see her house like this.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.844
It would be
my distinct honor

17:59.846 --> 18:02.780
to clean up everything,
my dear Princess.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.849
Okay, I'll get the fish
back in their cage,

18:04.851 --> 18:07.685
and finish getting ready
for the garden party.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.620
Back you go.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.855
FISH: Yes, Princess Sofia.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.590
And thanks for
lending a fin.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.758
Anytime, Sofia.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.362
Wow, you work
really fast, Mr. Spruce.

18:18.364 --> 18:21.332
Now what's next?

18:21.334 --> 18:23.601
( panting and barking )

18:26.638 --> 18:29.807
Wow, everything's
spotless.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.909
Ugh, except these guys.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.878
We need to get
the gargoyles back outside

18:33.880 --> 18:35.847
before Aunt Tilly
gets home.

18:35.849 --> 18:38.883
Yes, they don't match
the decor at all.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.823
They're just too heavy.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.358
What do we do?

18:47.360 --> 18:49.694
- ( door opens )
- Toodle-oo. I'm home.

18:52.364 --> 18:53.898
Are those gargoyles?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.900
Aunt Tilly, um...

18:55.902 --> 18:57.835
I can explain.

18:59.838 --> 19:02.907
( laughs ) She chose the green
roll, didn't she?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.876
The most challenging
roll of all.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.744
And she stopped them.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.713
She was splendid.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.948
Um, what are you two
talking about?

19:10.950 --> 19:12.850
Congratulations, Sofia.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.752
You passed the test.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.420
I'm so proud of you.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.723
- As am I.
- Test? What test?

19:18.725 --> 19:21.859
Why, the test that
your Auntie Tilly just gave you.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.428
Each music roll created
a magical problem

19:24.430 --> 19:25.963
for you to solve.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.699
And turning the gargoyles
back to stone

19:28.701 --> 19:30.001
was the hardest.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.870
- It was all a big test.
- A test of what?

19:32.872 --> 19:34.972
I needed to know
if you could be in charge,

19:34.974 --> 19:37.875
and solve any problem
that came your way.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.443
Why?

19:39.445 --> 19:43.915
when it comes time
to face your destiny,
my dear.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.449
My destiny?

19:45.451 --> 19:47.418
What you're meant
to do with your life.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.887
Your future.
One must be prepared.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.956
But... what is my destiny?

19:51.958 --> 19:55.826
Oh, only you
know the answer to
that question, my dear.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.763
But this will help you
find your way.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.865
What is this?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.034
Your reward for
passing the test.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.970
A history of
Enchancia castle.

20:05.972 --> 20:09.774
Yes. You live in
a very old castle, Sofia,

20:09.776 --> 20:12.710
and that book tells you
about all its secrets.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.779
Although there's one
that's not in the book.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.047
When I was a little girl,

20:16.049 --> 20:18.916
I had your exact
same bedroom.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.985
- You did?
- Oh, yes.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.854
I used to read in
that window seat for hours.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.958
Anyhow, there are many
more interesting tidbits
in that book,

20:26.960 --> 20:29.060
and you must read it
cover to cover,

20:29.062 --> 20:31.796
because knowledge
is the key to everything.

20:33.465 --> 20:34.865
Thank you, Aunt Tilly.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.968
Now, how about we
celebrate your success

20:36.970 --> 20:39.036
with a little garden party?

20:39.038 --> 20:41.739
I hope you don't mind
if the garden gnomes
join us.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.875
Sure, but what should we do
about the gargoyles?

20:44.877 --> 20:46.110
Oh, leave that to me, dear.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.048
Wait! Aunt Tilly, don't.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.962
We're back, boyos.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.864
Now, now, fellas,

21:06.866 --> 21:08.966
we'll have none of
your hijinks this time.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.968
Yeah, anything
you say, Miss Tilly.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.038
- Not a single
hijink.
- Good boys.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.540
All right, I want
you all back outside
where you belong

21:16.542 --> 21:20.077
then you can join us
in the garden for
a little party

21:20.079 --> 21:21.912
before we turn you
back to stone.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.115
- A party?
- We'll behave.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.017
We'll be anything
you want.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.853
Right this way,
ladies and gargoyles.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.988
( gargoyles laughing )

21:32.991 --> 21:35.126
Garden party in back.

21:37.062 --> 21:39.130
Um, Aunt Tilly?

21:40.565 --> 21:43.000
Are there any more
surprises I should know about?

21:43.002 --> 21:45.069
Oh, let's hope so.

21:47.005 --> 21:48.939
Hmm.
