in certain underground chatrooms.

...unless I agreed to act as a reference
when the FBI came calling.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.961

- How do I find him?

33:58.119 --> 34:00.087

- Come on, Eldon.

his employee records on our server.

Sam Lewis' digital fingerprint...

Late last night, the same code
that hacked the FBI server...

...was used to break the firewall
on an SMTP server in Maryland.

34:37.284 --> 34:40.879

of a man named Bob Gibbs.

to destroy his Sam Lewis identity...

...he knows that we're on to him,
he should be laying low.

35:02.350 --> 35:05.274
Maybe he didn't have a choice.
Maybe it was a necessity.

35:05.437 --> 35:08.156
A cover-up. He's got some kind of
connection to these people...
