03:32.588 --> 03:34.213
- Julian.
- Hey.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.567
- You came all the way out here?
- Yeah.

03:35.591 --> 03:36.860
I had to leave somebody off
up on the beach.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.152
- Thought I'd drop by.
- It's been weeks.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.802
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:40.762 --> 03:41.762
Hello, girls.

03:41.972 --> 03:45.141
You mean you didn't fly down to Rio
for the weekend?

03:46.351 --> 03:49.437
- Don't mind them. They're just jealous.
- I don't mind.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.648
I've been trying to reach you all day.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.610
Yeah, I got the message. Number?

03:56.028 --> 03:58.404
Tonight. It's a woman
from Charlottesville.

03:59.323 --> 04:02.783
She's flying in to close a negotiation
on her husband's estate.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.995
- First time?
- Yeah.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.706
She's meeting with the lawyers
in the morning.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.499
They want a chauffeur.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.170
Is she into drugs?

04:14.838 --> 04:16.589
No, no drugs.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.426
$1,000, right?

04:22.012 --> 04:23.846
$600 for me.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.681
Julie, don't start this up again.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.808
Look, you want 50-50? You go get Mike.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.603
Or one of those high school dropouts
you like so much.

04:31.355 --> 04:35.024
There's no percentage in it
if I don't get 50-50.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.652
You already cut me out of the repeaters.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.279
It's only fair. Only fair.

04:40.405 --> 04:44.283
It ain't fair, Julie,
but I don't have any choice.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.720
You got a choice.
You got a lot of choice.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.745
You can keep dealing
those retarded faggots

04:47.829 --> 04:50.289
- who don't know class from...
- Look who's talking.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.004
All right. 50-50.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.844
Who'd you drop off up the beach?

05:03.929 --> 05:05.972
Wouldn't you like to know.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.599
Julie, why do you do this to me?

05:08.684 --> 05:11.686
Look, you know anybody else
who gets in the LA Country Club?

05:12.312 --> 05:16.857
And that's not the Hillcrest,
or the Riverside, or the Riviera.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.921
I gotta run now, so why don't you
leave the info on the service?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.863
You don't want to take some sun?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.253
I'm sure the girls
would like some company.

05:27.494 --> 05:31.664
No, thanks. No way. See you later.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.708
How's the Swedish coming?

05:34.918 --> 05:36.460
Okay.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.255
Do you want me to help you?

06:21.131 --> 06:24.300
Listen to the recording
and repeat what you hear.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.803
Listen and then repeat.

06:28.013 --> 06:36.013
I am not interested in that.

06:46.823 --> 06:54.823
How much farther have we to go?

07:03.298 --> 07:05.841
Is this your first visit?

07:06.551 --> 07:07.927
Okay.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.687
Yeah?

07:19.147 --> 07:21.065
Okay, let him through.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.234
Hey, Leon, what's up?

07:23.360 --> 07:24.610
Hey, Julie, baby, listen,

07:24.694 --> 07:27.404
I hate to bug you like this,
but you gotta help me out.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.573
I had this Palm Springs gig
set up for Joey

07:29.658 --> 07:32.618
and the bitch split.
Least he ain't nowhere around.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.370
No, I can't do it.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.957
Getting a haircut now.
I got something on later this afternoon.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.084
Baby, baby, this is a two-hour gig.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.461
- Plus the drive.
- Plus the drive.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.463
Five C's. Straight in-and-out job.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.715
Nothing fancy. Come on.
Do me a favor.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.761
I don't know. Maybe. If I get some time.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.138
I'll give you 50 bucks.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.391
You go fuck yourself.
You think I'm in this for charity?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.269
Hey! Hey, hey, wait a minute, here.
Who's doing who a favor?

07:58.353 --> 08:00.229
Who called who up, begging for a sub?

08:00.313 --> 08:03.691
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I appreciate it.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.026
Anything for a friend.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.747
Excuse me.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.585
Mind if I take my cap off, ma'am?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.879
No, of course not.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.925
Thank you.

08:41.730 --> 08:45.566
I think I know this hotel
better than I do my own apartment.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.111
All the important people
come and stay here.

08:50.322 --> 08:53.073
You know, I used to be a pool boy here.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.161
Anything I can do to help you?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.705
Look, I'll open up
the champagne for you.

08:59.789 --> 09:03.125
- You don't have to open up the...
- Julian. My name is Julian.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.462
You don't have to open the champagne.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.590
I will give you a tip, don't worry.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.301
Oh, Jesus.

09:12.928 --> 09:17.640
Look, I'm sorry, Mrs Dobrun.
That's not what I meant at all. I was...

09:21.311 --> 09:23.270
I'm sorry.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.775
This your first time in LA?

09:30.612 --> 09:34.240
- Maybe you can be a help to me.
- Yeah?

09:34.699 --> 09:37.409
Well, I haven't been here
for several years

09:37.535 --> 09:41.163
and I was wondering if there are
any new really good restaurants.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.667
You know,
where the famous people go?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.169
Yeah, well,

09:47.504 --> 09:50.965
it's probably safer to recommend
the more established restaurants.

09:53.218 --> 09:57.554
There's Ma Maison and La Scala,

09:58.515 --> 10:00.599
and Scandia.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.272
And of the newer ones,
I hear that Le Dome is quite nice.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.107
Very popular.

10:10.819 --> 10:14.530
My, you are making me
thirsty just standing there.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.034
Now you can open the champagne.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.329
Pour me a drink,

10:23.123 --> 10:25.457
and set the bottle down.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.222
Yeah, she liked the pool boy bit.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.609
I'm going to see her again
tomorrow afternoon.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.479
Yeah.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.732
Okay, Anne. Yes. Love you, too.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.287
Paging Mrs Anderson.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.182
- Mrs Anderson, front desk, please.
- Hey, pretty lady.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.333
- Hi.
- Got my other jacket?

11:07.417 --> 11:10.586
- Sure. Here you go, Julian.
- Thanks.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.068
- Good evening, Mr Kay.
- Vince. How are you doing?

11:16.092 --> 11:17.885
Fine. Nice to see you.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.431
Then he has the nerve
to hit on my sister...

11:32.067 --> 11:34.151
- It's not the greatest job in the world.
- Yeah.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.236
- You get to meet people...
- Thank you.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.841
Yeah, I'll have a Scotch on the rocks.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.573
No, he's not.

11:39.908 --> 11:43.118
I told you. He's looking right at us.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.086
What'll it be?

11:52.170 --> 11:53.962
No, that's okay, Jim.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.994
Je m'appelle Julian Kay.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.081
Excusez-moi, Michelle Jost.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.131
Mr Kay would like another drink.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.052
Manhattan. Dry Manhattan on the rocks.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.345
Yes, sir.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.431
- You speak English.
- You speak English.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.933
- You fooled me.
- And you, me.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.602
How long have you been over here
in Los Angeles?

12:50.687 --> 12:52.771
I live here.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.107
You live here? I don't understand.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.191
You wouldn't.

12:56.860 --> 13:00.529
I'm just trying to refresh
my college French.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.908
I usually practise with a friend,
but she's not here yet.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.131
Where are you from?

13:20.550 --> 13:24.928
I was born in Torino,
but I studied at Nantes.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.598
You hardly have any accent at all.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.808
Yeah, I've been traveling too much.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.394
I envy you.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.063
I love to travel.

13:35.773 --> 13:40.235
I used to travel a lot, but my husband's
involved in local politics.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.697
So now I just practise French.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.951
He thinks it's chic
to have a bilingual wife.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.997
I think he's right.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.874
Where are you going?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.044
I made a mistake.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.509
My husband's in New York.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.930
What about your friend?

14:10.225 --> 14:12.976
I'm not waiting for anyone.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.772
You still don't understand.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.565
Understand what?

14:21.486 --> 14:23.737
Who I am.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.616
Who are you?

14:28.785 --> 14:32.663
You don't even understand who you are,
why you're sitting here.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.666
Why are you here?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.545
I've got to go.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.797
All right. Just one thing.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.675
Why did you come on to me?

14:45.343 --> 14:47.844
Like I said, I made a mistake.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.139
I heard you speaking French.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.268
Often in these big hotels,

14:54.352 --> 14:56.395
you run into women
from foreign countries

14:56.479 --> 15:00.816
who may need a translator or a guide.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.279
And they hire you?

15:05.863 --> 15:07.573
Yes.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.497
How many languages do you speak?

15:17.333 --> 15:19.042
Five or six.

15:21.713 --> 15:26.550
Plus the international language.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.179
That's right.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.188
Well, now,

15:40.356 --> 15:44.067
you're something really special,
aren't you?

15:47.196 --> 15:49.531
You're one to talk.

15:49.657 --> 15:54.036
I saw you sitting here. You wanted me
to come over. I came over.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.039
I know what I see.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.877
How much would you have charged me?

16:02.253 --> 16:04.296
As what? Translator or guide?

16:04.464 --> 16:05.714
No.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.591
Just one fuck.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.638
Now, you've made a mistake.
I don't do that.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.973
You don't?

16:15.892 --> 16:20.062
I know what I see, too, Monsieur Kay.

16:22.106 --> 16:26.276
It's been a pleasure talking to you,
Madame Jost.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.154
Don't spoil it. Bonne chance.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.772
Look, mister,
someone's made a mistake here.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.023
I don't do fags.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.608
I didn't mean that.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.401
And I don't do couples, either.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.112
No, no, no. You don't understand.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.616
It's just my wife Judy. Not me.

18:38.159 --> 18:41.411
- Just her.
- Okay.

18:42.163 --> 18:45.207
- But I can watch.
- Of course.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.543
Would you like a drink?

18:53.382 --> 18:55.217
Not yet.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.971
I think I'd like my money now.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.849
Sure. Sure.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.229
- I like to talk afterwards, too.
- Sure.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.641
Hello, Judy.

19:45.601 --> 19:49.312
You're a very sexy lady,
a very good-looking woman.

19:50.898 --> 19:54.609
Very pretty woman.
You're gonna like me.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.696
I can tell.

19:58.823 --> 20:02.450
Because I like you. I like you.

20:04.245 --> 20:07.289
So just relax and close your eyes.

20:08.749 --> 20:12.043
Just relax and let your mind run free.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.090
Don't worry about anything.

20:17.174 --> 20:20.635
I can take care of you.
I know what you want.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.476
That's right. Close your eyes.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.188
Forget about him.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.348
This has nothing to do with him.
This is just you and me.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.903
No, no, no, from behind.

20:38.487 --> 20:41.156
It has to be from behind.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.914
Okay, baby,
just flip over on your stomach.

20:49.624 --> 20:53.501
Just relax. Don't worry.
Leave everything to me,

20:54.086 --> 20:57.547
'cause I'm gonna take care of you.
I'm gonna take care of you.

20:58.466 --> 21:02.260
I'm gonna get you wet.
I'm gonna get you very wet.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.554
I know how to do this.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.390
Now slap her.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.023
Slap that cunt.

21:26.661 --> 21:27.744
Hey, Leon.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.205
- How you doing, Julie?
- All right.

21:34.835 --> 21:38.046
I want to thank you
for helping me out, Julie.

21:39.215 --> 21:43.593
Finally found Joey holed up
with one of his boyfriends,

21:43.678 --> 21:47.597
just banging away, you know how it is.
Dumb bastard.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.140
Hello, Julian.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.227
- Hi. I'll just have a Perrier.
- Okay.

21:52.395 --> 21:53.728
Okay.

21:55.022 --> 21:58.692
You made quite a hit in Palm Springs.
They want you back.

21:59.777 --> 22:03.071
I'm serious.
They want you to come back this week.

22:05.574 --> 22:09.494
I wouldn't take much, you know. It's...
They're regulars for me.

22:09.578 --> 22:13.123
You lied to me, Leon.
It was a rough trick.

22:15.084 --> 22:19.170
I forgot. You got scruples now?

22:20.589 --> 22:23.883
I don't like playing
the same numbers too often.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.302
They get possessive.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.055
I can't be possessed.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.766
That include Miss Anne?

22:32.727 --> 22:34.352
Anne who?

22:34.895 --> 22:38.440
Boy, I don't know why you fool around
with that dumb bitch.

22:38.774 --> 22:39.941
I'll tell you why, Leon.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.862
She's got a job coming up for me
in a week.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.114
Eight grand.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.283
Can you get me that?

22:48.951 --> 22:51.453
All right. All right.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.371
Thanks, hon.

22:55.624 --> 23:00.003
Just trying to warn you, that's all.
I mean, that bitch will sell you out.

23:00.629 --> 23:04.632
But you really care about me, don't you?
Don't you, Leon?

23:04.800 --> 23:06.718
You care.

23:07.887 --> 23:11.056
You know,
you walk an awful thin line, Julie.

23:11.348 --> 23:14.726
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.
I mean, you're getting awful cocky.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.394
All the rest of the boys are happy

23:16.604 --> 23:19.689
with a car, house in the hills,
but not you.

23:20.649 --> 23:24.986
You got all your rich pussy lined up,
once-a-month tricks,

23:25.112 --> 23:29.407
a dip in the pool, a little tennis,
and orgasm.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.410
I'm just trying to warn you as a friend.

23:32.828 --> 23:36.998
If those bitches ever turn on you,
you're through.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.461
You're sure about that?

23:41.545 --> 23:43.797
They'll cut you out.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.554
Yeah?

25:58.390 --> 26:00.475
Says she's a friend?

26:00.684 --> 26:02.685
Where does she know me from?

26:04.939 --> 26:07.106
Yeah, send her up.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.294
I'm Michelle.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.013
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't hard.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.058
Are you surprised?

26:51.694 --> 26:53.653
What do you want?

26:56.156 --> 27:01.953
I would have thought that you'd live
in a place with thick red carpet,

27:02.621 --> 27:04.182
big circular bed
and mirrors on the ceiling.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.540
Bordello.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.752
This is my apartment.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.713
Women don't come here.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.095
- You're going out?
- Yeah.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.849
Business?

27:24.059 --> 27:25.601
Maybe.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.563
Isn't it a little late?

27:29.231 --> 27:31.190
Isn't it a little late for you?

27:31.859 --> 27:35.236
My husband's still in New York.
I'm alone.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.381
I thought it would be easier.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.509
What did you say?

27:59.887 --> 28:02.096
I said, "I thought it would be easier."

28:02.264 --> 28:04.015
What would be?

28:05.517 --> 28:09.103
To be with you, to procure you.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.231
I told you, you're mistaken.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.380
Why are you doing this to me?

28:35.464 --> 28:37.090
What am I doing?

28:37.174 --> 28:39.133
Embarrassing me.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.596
I'm not embarrassing you.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.477
I can't keep up

28:52.022 --> 28:55.316
this front much longer.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.154
I came here.

29:00.364 --> 29:03.116
I found out who you were,
where you live.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.952
I came here in the middle of the night.

29:08.831 --> 29:11.249
I want to know what

29:11.667 --> 29:15.002
it would be like to fuck you.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.674
I brought money.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.346
What more can I do? I...

29:26.223 --> 29:27.849
I...

29:30.519 --> 29:32.270
I like...

29:35.482 --> 29:37.859
I don't want to know.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.267
Don't say that.

30:12.895 --> 30:15.480
You got me aroused
just thinking about it.

30:18.066 --> 30:21.777
I'm lying here with a hard-on,
it's not even 10:00 yet.

30:24.031 --> 30:27.575
Don't tease me.
Come on, baby, you're just teasing me.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.245
I'll have to hang up
and jerk off right now.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.663
I am.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.084
Yes, I'm touching myself.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.129
You like that, don't you?

30:43.342 --> 30:46.010
Come on, baby. Don't say that.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.180
We're lying here getting aroused,

30:49.264 --> 30:52.225
talking about having more pleasure
than you've had in years,

30:52.935 --> 30:57.396
you got to bring up
some stupid little $1,200 stereo?

30:59.775 --> 31:02.860
How much does your husband make?
What's he worth? What's he worth?

31:02.945 --> 31:04.820
A couple of million?

31:06.573 --> 31:10.243
Of course I could do without it.
I can listen to the radio.

31:10.661 --> 31:12.620
The speaker's cracked.

31:15.249 --> 31:17.792
Lisa. Lisa, listen to yourself.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.711
Just listen to yourself.
Do you hear what you're saying?

31:21.171 --> 31:23.381
Can you hold on a second?
Someone's at the door.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.425
Good morning.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.052
What do you want for breakfast?

31:28.136 --> 31:32.640
Coffee, orange juice, croissant, eggs?

31:34.393 --> 31:35.685
Julian Kay.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.979
Yeah, I want two coffees,
orange juice, croissant...

31:38.063 --> 31:39.230
No eggs.

31:39.314 --> 31:43.359
One scrambled egg
and a side of cottage cheese.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.611
Lisa, this is really embarrassing.

31:45.696 --> 31:47.238
I'm sitting here with a hard-on,

31:47.322 --> 31:49.574
and there's people all over
and I can't talk to you now.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.369
All right, I'll see you about 5:00.
Bye-bye, love.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.085
So, what do you think?

32:01.670 --> 32:03.504
About what?

32:05.048 --> 32:07.842
Did you make the right decision
to come here last night?

32:10.012 --> 32:12.138
Was it what you expected?

32:13.140 --> 32:16.475
No. It was like really making love.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.438
I'm not used...

32:21.773 --> 32:23.941
That's not what I expected.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.529
Do you remember
what you said last night?

32:31.158 --> 32:33.034
Yes.

32:36.747 --> 32:39.373
Now, if I bid on it, I
have to buy it, right?

32:39.583 --> 32:40.625
Right.

32:40.709 --> 32:43.961
Well, now, the one I want is
right over here. There it is!

32:44.046 --> 32:45.046
What does it say?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.756
I saw one just like that in Madam Wu's.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.133
"Jacobean. Late 17th century."

32:49.217 --> 32:52.386
It's estimated at $4,800 to $5,200.

32:53.889 --> 32:56.098
This has been worked on.
There's glue in it.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.433
Yeah.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.310
I don't know.

32:59.394 --> 33:03.689
My guess,
it's gonna go for $5,000, 55 maybe.

33:05.359 --> 33:08.069
It's a great piece,
but it's not a great bargain.

33:08.862 --> 33:11.989
Now, 48, that's a good bargain.
What do you think?

33:14.451 --> 33:18.537
It's perfect for the guest room,
but I don't know.

33:18.622 --> 33:21.749
You know, I saw a George III chest
around here somewhere

33:21.833 --> 33:24.627
going for, like, 22, 23.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.716
It's a lot of money,
but it's a good investment.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.339
Beautiful lines on it.

33:28.715 --> 33:33.052
Probably the best bargain is that
tacky garniture set over there,

33:33.136 --> 33:34.845
if the Japs don't bid it up. What is it?

33:34.930 --> 33:37.682
- Do you see who I see?
- Who is it?

33:37.766 --> 33:39.725
It's Randolph Sloan's widow.

33:40.268 --> 33:42.895
- She's a stockholder in Jim's company.
- Is she still alive?

33:42.979 --> 33:45.356
She's gonna make a beeline
straight for us.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.358
There goes the garniture set.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.819
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

33:51.029 --> 33:56.575
Come, Lisa, we must face the enemy
before they face us.

33:57.619 --> 33:59.161
Lucille!

34:00.038 --> 34:02.915
How lovely to see you.
Are you buying or selling?

34:03.125 --> 34:05.084
- Just looking.
- How nice.

34:05.919 --> 34:08.795
There is an exquisite
garniture set over there.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.507
Lucille, this is Willem Shoenvelt.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.509
He's helping me redecorate
the guest house.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.678
Great hospitality, madam.

34:16.679 --> 34:20.474
The dress! Look, the dress.
Beautiful dress.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.810
Goes well with the face.
They're both beige.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.311
Willem.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.355
Madam!

34:28.190 --> 34:30.985
- What is going on here?
- I don't know. So sorry.

34:31.485 --> 34:32.485
Willem.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.989
Lisa, we must go, auf Wiedersehen.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.876
- Did you see her face?
- I can't believe you did that!

35:38.845 --> 35:41.388
I wish your husband would come back.

35:42.224 --> 35:44.266
- He has.
- Good.

35:51.107 --> 35:53.651
I can't stop thinking about you.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.446
Do you mind?

36:02.911 --> 36:05.579
What have you been doing?

36:06.665 --> 36:09.083
- When?
- This morning.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.253
Driving around.

36:13.380 --> 36:17.091
I drove to Anaheim,
then I drove to Long Beach.

36:17.259 --> 36:19.760
I pumped my own gas in Long Beach.

36:20.762 --> 36:23.013
Then I drove here.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.976
You know, Michelle,

36:27.269 --> 36:29.562
I'm really not part of your problems.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.482
And I'm certainly not the solution
to your problems.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.278
I brought money.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.783
Don't...

36:44.160 --> 36:46.120
I don't want your money.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.123
I'll buy you something, then.

36:49.791 --> 36:51.792
I'll buy you that stereo.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.003
I got a stereo.

36:55.005 --> 36:56.672
What, then?

37:03.763 --> 37:04.805
Come on.

37:07.309 --> 37:09.602
- What?
- We're going to my room.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.398
Bulgari. You want it?

38:38.483 --> 38:39.566
No.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.736
Good, 'cause you're not gonna get it.

38:43.613 --> 38:46.365
Tell me everything about you.
Right now.

38:46.449 --> 38:49.576
God. Why?

38:50.495 --> 38:52.746
I don't know. It seems important.

38:53.957 --> 38:56.333
We just made love, didn't we?

38:56.418 --> 38:58.168
Yes.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.255
Then you know everything
there is to know.

39:01.589 --> 39:04.258
That's silly. Where are you from?

39:04.759 --> 39:07.636
No. I'm not from anywhere.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.265
I'm from this bed.

39:13.685 --> 39:14.977
Anything worth knowing about me

39:15.061 --> 39:17.771
you can learn from letting me
make love to you.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.941
That's not true.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.987
Why do you sleep with older women?

39:27.490 --> 39:29.533
I prefer older women.

39:29.993 --> 39:31.452
Why?

39:32.787 --> 39:36.540
What's the use of bringing
some high schooler to climax?

39:36.916 --> 39:41.545
Some silly teenager gets wet in the
movies and goes home to masturbate.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.132
No challenge.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.260
It has no meaning.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.515
The other night,

39:54.142 --> 39:56.602
that night I met you at the hotel,

39:57.687 --> 39:59.813
I was with a woman.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.649
Somebody's mother.

40:03.693 --> 40:06.487
Her husband didn't care
about her any more.

40:07.822 --> 40:10.908
This woman hadn't had an orgasm
in maybe 10 years.

40:13.119 --> 40:15.621
It took me three hours to get her off.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.374
For a while there, I didn't think
I was gonna be able to do it.

40:20.835 --> 40:26.298
When it was over, I felt like I'd
done something, something worthwhile.

40:29.719 --> 40:34.515
Who else would've taken the time
or cared enough to do it right?

40:38.645 --> 40:39.978
My God.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.249
These are not the handcuffs
your wife was wearing

40:42.273 --> 40:44.691
when she was killed, Mr Rheiman.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.361
Those we found in the study.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.696
They were in a filing cabinet.

40:50.865 --> 40:54.368
Along with some dildos,
some paddles and some...

40:54.452 --> 40:55.638
You know what I'm talking about.

40:55.662 --> 41:01.333
Listen, your private sex life
is of no concern to me or to the LAPD.

41:03.211 --> 41:06.421
However, the manner
in which your wife was assaulted

41:06.506 --> 41:11.969
suggests the killer was, may have
been, a guest in your home once.

41:12.053 --> 41:16.515
I'll try to keep what you tell me
in the strictest confidence.

41:17.016 --> 41:21.145
However, I'm gonna have to have
detailed information

41:21.938 --> 41:24.565
about you and your wife's sex practices.

41:25.775 --> 41:30.988
The names of the parties, if any,
that were involved. All right?

41:42.792 --> 41:46.420
Sorry. Here you go. And this, too.

41:46.588 --> 41:48.630
So I get the Salvation Army.
Thanks a lot.

41:48.715 --> 41:50.090
Yep.

41:50.592 --> 41:52.426
Mrs Stewart.

41:53.761 --> 41:57.931
Hi, excuse me.
Does Mr Julian Kay live here?

41:58.933 --> 42:01.935
I'm Detective Sunday.

42:02.687 --> 42:04.563
I'm with the Homicide Bureau,

42:04.647 --> 42:05.875
and I'd just like to ask him
a few questions.

42:05.899 --> 42:07.274
What do you want?

42:08.651 --> 42:10.194
You're Mr Kay?

42:10.945 --> 42:13.530
Hello, I'm Detective Sunday.
How are you?

42:15.033 --> 42:16.783
Come on.

42:16.910 --> 42:19.620
Look, I'm walking into Westwood.
Do you wanna talk there?

42:19.746 --> 42:22.664
- Sure.
- I'll pick that stuff up later, Jill.

42:29.505 --> 42:32.299
I'm investigating the Rheiman murder
from the Los Angeles area.

42:32.967 --> 42:34.968
You heard about the case?

42:35.887 --> 42:37.698
Yeah, that's the one
that was in the paper, right?

42:37.722 --> 42:38.889
Yeah.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.226
- Palm Springs.
- Right again.

42:42.727 --> 42:44.603
Yeah, I think I read
something about that.

42:44.687 --> 42:45.687
Yeah, I bet you did.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.481
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

42:47.607 --> 42:49.650
Listen, we'll sit in the back.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.240
And what were you doing
Tuesday night?

42:58.076 --> 42:59.826
Tuesday.

43:00.662 --> 43:02.913
- Or people.
- Tuesday night, I was...

43:04.832 --> 43:09.127
I was with a friend at a pre-auction
viewing at Sotheby Parke Bernet.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.171
She'll verify that?

43:12.882 --> 43:15.550
We're talking about a woman
of substance here.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.845
- I think she enjoys her privacy.
- I don't want this any more.

43:19.180 --> 43:22.891
If that's what this is to you, okay?
I don't want it! I don't want it!

43:24.727 --> 43:25.978
Come over here.

43:27.063 --> 43:31.024
You can't mix May and December.
It just...

43:31.526 --> 43:32.776
Yep.

43:33.027 --> 43:35.362
You like cigars?

43:35.738 --> 43:37.489
I'm sorry.

43:37.573 --> 43:38.824
Am I a suspect?

43:38.908 --> 43:41.011
No, no, no, no. But we're gonna
have to check out your alibi

43:41.035 --> 43:42.715
just to be on the safe side,
for your sake.

43:42.787 --> 43:46.581
All right, now, this work that you
were doing for the Rheimans,

43:47.375 --> 43:50.627
was this as a translator or a chauffeur?

43:52.255 --> 43:54.381
Neither. This was...

43:55.133 --> 43:57.592
This was more of a personal matter.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.761
You're friends?

44:00.179 --> 44:02.097
Not exactly.

44:03.391 --> 44:04.891
Not exactly. All right, then.

44:04.976 --> 44:07.894
Then what exactly is it

44:07.979 --> 44:10.814
that you were doing with the Rheimans,
or for the Rheimans?

44:11.816 --> 44:13.358
Nothing special.

44:14.235 --> 44:16.153
Chit-chat. I don't know.

44:17.697 --> 44:20.073
I have a hard time
remembering about these things.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.451
You know, I meet a lot of people.

44:22.744 --> 44:25.620
Yes, yes.
No, I understand your problem.

44:25.747 --> 44:27.975
Let's see now, you got there,
you sat around, you had a few drinks.

44:27.999 --> 44:30.125
Next thing you know, you're back in LA.
Is that right?

44:30.752 --> 44:32.396
More or less.
You want another cup of coffee?

44:32.420 --> 44:34.629
That's bullshit, Julian.
I'm gonna take you in.

44:34.714 --> 44:36.089
It'll be good for your memory.

44:36.299 --> 44:40.927
You seem like a young man
who needs a little self-improvement.

44:45.099 --> 44:46.933
Look, Mr Sunday...

44:47.268 --> 44:49.227
Detective Sunday.

44:50.772 --> 44:52.898
Look, Detective.

44:53.608 --> 44:57.861
I want to cooperate with the police
in any way I can, but these...

44:59.489 --> 45:01.698
These are very delicate matters.

45:02.909 --> 45:07.454
Things that may not fall
under the exact letter of the law.

45:09.624 --> 45:11.833
Publicity's the last thing I want.

45:13.086 --> 45:14.795
I'm not gonna book you, Julian.

45:14.879 --> 45:17.089
And I'm not gonna take away
your chauffeur's license.

45:17.799 --> 45:21.176
I'm not gonna bring you up on
drug charges. I could do all of that.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.930
Just tell me about the Rheimans.

45:26.933 --> 45:30.143
Please welcome Charles Stratton.

45:41.406 --> 45:43.573
Mac, thank you.

45:43.658 --> 45:47.119
I hope you're having
as good a time as the rest of us,

45:47.537 --> 45:51.289
trying to figure out what this stuff is
on our plates.

45:52.667 --> 45:53.875
But most of all...

45:53.960 --> 45:55.437
Who's that man up there
who's second from...

45:55.461 --> 45:59.673
I'm happy to have the opportunity
to speak to you in an informal way

45:59.757 --> 46:03.009
about the problems
facing southern California.

46:03.177 --> 46:06.555
More than any other
community in the country...

46:06.931 --> 46:09.516
Do you follow California politics, Julian?

46:10.309 --> 46:12.602
- Not very much.
- We not only use oil and gas...

46:12.687 --> 46:14.062
You're smart. They're all whores.

46:14.147 --> 46:15.833
More extravagantly
than any other community,

46:15.857 --> 46:19.276
but we also have the technological
means and know-how

46:19.360 --> 46:24.114
to help free America
from the grip of fossil fuels.

46:24.365 --> 46:27.451
In times of austerity like these,

46:27.577 --> 46:31.246
it is the privileged
who should lead the way,

46:31.456 --> 46:34.207
who should set an example
for the rest of the country.

46:34.333 --> 46:37.461
- I believe...
- This guy is a real comer.

46:37.545 --> 46:39.129
That example.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.805
So, I said, "What happens
when Mike Curb leaves town?"

46:54.854 --> 46:56.021
I'm telling you...

46:56.105 --> 46:57.791
Nice of you to come.
You know my wife, Michelle?

46:57.815 --> 46:59.608
She's pretty, isn't she?

46:59.734 --> 47:01.151
Yes, very.

47:01.235 --> 47:02.235
Jim, good to see you.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.464
Thank you for coming.
You know Michelle.

47:03.488 --> 47:04.821
Glad to meet you.

47:04.906 --> 47:09.242
Mrs Laudner, how nice of you to come.
It's always a pleasure to see you.

47:09.744 --> 47:12.329
It's bullshit, but I like it.
Can we talk later?

47:12.413 --> 47:14.664
Certainly. Mrs Laudner,
my wife Michelle.

47:14.749 --> 47:16.029
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

47:16.083 --> 47:17.204
It's a pleasure to meet you.

47:17.210 --> 47:19.313
- And this is Julian Kay.
- It's an honor to meet you, sir.

47:19.337 --> 47:20.921
I enjoyed the speech.

47:22.882 --> 47:25.008
Mrs Stratton.

47:27.678 --> 47:29.471
You're a fortunate man, Senator.

47:31.766 --> 47:33.350
Well, you know what he is, don't you?

47:33.434 --> 47:37.729
That boy is gonna go far.
Got a nice wife, too.

47:37.939 --> 47:39.564
Tell me about them, Frances.

47:39.649 --> 47:41.066
Well, I told you he's a comer.

47:41.150 --> 47:44.611
No, I want to hear
about them as a couple.

47:44.946 --> 47:48.198
- How is their marriage?
- Julian, you are incorrigible.

47:48.282 --> 47:50.450
No, come on. I mean it.
I wanna hear about it.

47:50.576 --> 47:52.536
I hear she's very unhappy.

49:22.209 --> 49:23.710
How you doing?

49:54.158 --> 49:55.825
Really pretty picture...

49:57.995 --> 50:00.997
- Julian!
- Well, hello.

50:01.082 --> 50:03.166
What a surprise.

50:03.542 --> 50:05.335
You do a lot of shopping here, maybe.

50:05.419 --> 50:08.046
No. I'm just browsing.

50:08.214 --> 50:10.298
Just browsing.

50:11.467 --> 50:13.968
Well, I gotta go now.
Lot of appointments.

50:14.095 --> 50:17.931
It's been very nice talking to you,
Mrs Stratton.

50:18.432 --> 50:19.974
Wait.

50:23.562 --> 50:25.563
I have to talk to you.

50:29.485 --> 50:31.820
Yeah. Me, too.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.240
Want to have a drink?

50:37.034 --> 50:39.577
It's kind of early for a drink.

50:39.662 --> 50:42.080
Maybe we could get to that
in about an hour.

50:42.331 --> 50:43.873
What do you think?

50:43.958 --> 50:46.042
I think you're awful.

50:46.127 --> 50:49.170
I think you're right. Come on.

50:53.884 --> 50:56.302
I've seen your husband on television.

50:57.304 --> 50:59.347
He's very impressive.

51:00.141 --> 51:02.142
What's that supposed to mean?

51:05.730 --> 51:08.481
Nothing. I'm sorry.

51:10.484 --> 51:13.486
I would never do anything
to hurt him politically.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.865
I could never leave him.

51:19.326 --> 51:21.661
Don't let him blackmail you.

51:21.787 --> 51:24.998
He has this big political thing about

51:25.875 --> 51:29.002
having a family.

51:30.004 --> 51:32.589
He keeps wanting me to be pregnant.

51:33.674 --> 51:34.758
What are we talking about?

51:34.842 --> 51:37.552
Are we talking about
what he wants or what you want?

51:38.804 --> 51:40.847
I can't tell any more.

51:45.311 --> 51:47.103
What can I do?

51:50.524 --> 51:52.066
I don't know.

51:53.694 --> 51:55.028
Be yourself.

51:56.864 --> 51:58.406
Leave him?

51:59.909 --> 52:02.202
His career will survive.

52:03.287 --> 52:05.205
People forget.

52:08.209 --> 52:11.044
These things have to be done quietly.

52:15.549 --> 52:20.386
Don't let him fool you with his talk
about duty and self-sacrifice.

52:22.223 --> 52:25.809
He's getting exactly what he wants.
You've got to do the same.

52:26.894 --> 52:29.521
Take your pleasure when you can.

52:32.233 --> 52:35.527
How about you? Where do you come in?

52:36.570 --> 52:39.072
How do you get pleasure?

53:07.726 --> 53:10.895
What a surprise. Mr Kay.

53:11.522 --> 53:13.481
Detective Sunday.

53:13.566 --> 53:16.568
You are full of surprises.
Come on in. Sit down.

53:16.652 --> 53:18.194
Take a shine. You need it.

53:18.279 --> 53:21.197
Thank you, Julian.
Well, you're quite dressed up today.

53:21.282 --> 53:23.449
Well, I'm going to the country club.

53:23.826 --> 53:27.120
To the country club.
We checked on your alibi.

53:27.496 --> 53:32.041
Mrs Williams said that you had
been with her Tuesday night.

53:33.961 --> 53:38.506
But you dropped her off at 7:00.

53:38.674 --> 53:40.675
The Rheiman murder was at 10:00.

53:40.759 --> 53:42.093
Shit.

53:43.888 --> 53:46.014
But I described the house.
The bedroom.

53:46.098 --> 53:48.558
Yeah, she said you had been
helping her redecorate,

53:48.642 --> 53:50.843
that you had been to Parke Bernet,
picking out a bureau.

53:50.895 --> 53:53.062
- Right. Right.
- I can understand why she'd say that.

53:53.147 --> 53:54.856
She has a reputation to protect.

53:56.317 --> 53:58.151
How do you do it, Julian?

53:58.235 --> 54:03.907
This afternoon with Mrs Jarvie
and tonight at the country club.

54:04.074 --> 54:07.535
How do you seduce
all these women?

54:07.953 --> 54:11.456
I don't like you poking around
in my private life, Sunday,

54:12.333 --> 54:14.375
bugging my friends.

54:16.712 --> 54:20.214
I'll tell you what. You lay off my clients,

54:20.299 --> 54:22.967
I'll give you a few pointers
picking up women, okay?

54:23.302 --> 54:25.011
How's that?

54:27.514 --> 54:30.266
First, obviously, you dress for shit.

54:30.351 --> 54:32.185
Anybody can fix that, no problem.

54:32.269 --> 54:33.770
- It's your face.
- Face?

54:33.854 --> 54:35.396
Face. Bad face.

54:35.481 --> 54:37.000
And your body.
What's wrong with your body?

54:37.024 --> 54:39.609
You have back problems?
You look like a monkey sitting there.

54:39.693 --> 54:42.403
- Come on.
- Hey, back. Shoulders back. Back.

54:42.529 --> 54:45.990
And your jaw, work the jaw.
Exercise. You don't want it slack.

54:46.075 --> 54:49.369
- Up tight, tight. Yes.
- Tight. Tight.

54:50.663 --> 54:52.956
Would you be willing
to come in for a line-up?

54:57.294 --> 54:58.711
Sure. Why not?

54:58.796 --> 55:00.713
Doesn't it ever bother you, Julian?

55:01.173 --> 55:03.299
- What?
- What you do.

55:06.095 --> 55:09.472
Giving pleasure to women?
I'm supposed to feel guilty about that?

55:09.807 --> 55:11.307
But it's not legal.

55:11.392 --> 55:13.351
Legal is not always right.

55:14.186 --> 55:16.562
Men make laws.
Sometimes they're wrong.

55:17.606 --> 55:19.857
They're stupid,

55:21.402 --> 55:23.236
or jealous.

55:24.196 --> 55:25.738
And you know better?

55:26.573 --> 55:28.574
Some people are above the law.

55:29.952 --> 55:31.828
Well, how do these people
know who they are?

55:31.912 --> 55:33.329
They know.

55:35.416 --> 55:37.417
They ask themselves.

55:39.003 --> 55:41.587
Eugene, thanks.
I'll take care of you in a minute.

55:41.714 --> 55:43.381
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

55:44.591 --> 55:46.592
- May I?
- Please.

55:47.261 --> 55:49.762
Yeah, the other one
could use some work.

55:51.932 --> 55:54.934
Why didn't you tell me
you handcuffed Mrs Rheiman?

55:57.438 --> 55:59.188
I didn't.

55:59.273 --> 56:01.315
Yeah, you said that.

56:01.525 --> 56:04.569
That's why I went back and had it
checked it twice with the coroner.

56:05.112 --> 56:07.905
Apparently, she must have
put up quite a struggle.

56:07.990 --> 56:11.492
There were cuts on her wrists
from being handcuffed.

56:11.702 --> 56:14.203
But underneath the cuts
there were bruises

56:14.288 --> 56:15.872
from where she was handcuffed earlier.

56:15.956 --> 56:19.375
Now the coroner estimates
about 48 hours earlier,

56:19.626 --> 56:21.627
which would be the night
you were there.

56:25.466 --> 56:27.467
Jesus Christ.

56:29.636 --> 56:32.180
Now, she was beaten
with a heavy metal object,

56:32.306 --> 56:35.641
raped and violated with an object,

56:35.726 --> 56:37.477
presumably the murder weapon.

56:56.246 --> 56:57.997
Yeah.

56:59.708 --> 57:02.001
Yeah, I handcuffed her.

57:04.755 --> 57:07.090
But you gotta understand
about these people,

57:07.174 --> 57:09.008
like the Rheimans.

57:13.722 --> 57:15.681
It's like a game to them.

57:17.601 --> 57:19.102
I'll explain.

57:24.817 --> 57:26.317
Julian.

57:26.401 --> 57:29.362
Yeah? What is it?

57:29.780 --> 57:32.156
They were here two hours, the police.

57:32.241 --> 57:33.366
They were here two hours.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.535
I couldn't stop them.
They had a search warrant.

57:36.203 --> 57:37.870
It's all right, Jill. It's okay.

57:37.996 --> 57:39.664
What's going on?

58:10.571 --> 58:12.238
Jill, it's Julian.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.032
No, it's okay. It's okay.

58:15.117 --> 58:16.909
Send the maid up now.

58:36.346 --> 58:38.347
Hi. How you doing, Timmy?

58:39.266 --> 58:42.143
Julian! You're becoming
a regular visitor.

58:42.227 --> 58:43.936
What's happening?

58:45.439 --> 58:47.565
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

58:47.649 --> 58:50.109
I don't like to have anybody
in the house when Tim visits.

58:50.485 --> 58:53.154
Courts might not let me see him at all.

58:54.615 --> 58:56.991
Let's go down to the beach, then.

59:20.140 --> 59:21.474
Watch out.

59:23.518 --> 59:24.852
Thank you.

59:29.191 --> 59:31.067
I think I'm in a frame.

59:31.151 --> 59:33.653
- Who's putting you in?
- I don't know.

59:34.154 --> 59:35.988
All I see is a frame.

59:36.740 --> 59:39.659
It's that Rheiman murder.
Out in Palm Springs.

59:39.743 --> 59:41.619
You tricked with them?

59:42.037 --> 59:44.372
Once. Just once. Favour to Leon.

59:44.957 --> 59:48.501
- Two-timing bastard.
- So I'm a nice guy. I can't help it.

59:48.919 --> 59:50.419
You check around for me?

59:50.504 --> 59:53.214
Why don't you ask
your new friend Leon?

59:53.674 --> 59:55.174
I may just do that!

59:56.510 --> 59:59.845
You trick for other people,
you cheat me out of money,

59:59.930 --> 01:00:03.224
and then when you need a favor,
you come back to me.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.271
If I help you, you'll have to help me.

01:00:10.399 --> 01:00:11.524
How?

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:15.403
You'll have to come back to me,
work strictly for me.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:19.532
Wait a minute, now.
No, it's got nothing to do with that.

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:21.284
- Like shit it doesn't.
- No.

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.702
I made you, Julie.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.787
I taught you everything you know,

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:29.083
how to dress, how to behave,
how to treat women, how to make love.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.793
And then one day
you come to me and say,

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:33.337
"I'm too good for you," and cut me out.

01:00:33.422 --> 01:00:35.298
It ain't right, Julie.

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:39.343
Things are different now.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:40.886
I'm more than what I used to be.

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:45.975
I'm getting older, Anne.
I gotta keep moving forward.

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:49.270
- Just move.
- Please, Julie, save me the speeches.

01:00:51.732 --> 01:00:53.858
How's your Swedish coming?

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.818
I'll be ready.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:58.237
She's flying in from Stockholm
on Thursday.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:02.074
She apparently has certain
sexual idiosyncrasies.

01:01:04.036 --> 01:01:06.537
Are you going to come back with me?

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.625
You did it, didn't you?

01:01:13.754 --> 01:01:14.837
What?

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.423
The Rheiman killing.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:25.514
Don't worry, Julie.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.224
It doesn't matter.

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:39.236
Thank you.
It's been a wonderful evening.

01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:47.787
- Can I see you again tomorrow?
- How about this one?

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:51.207
There was a sexy girl
from Borgan Place...

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.629
Do you live alone?

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:01.759
It's such a sweet face.

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.144
No, not yet.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.813
Why not?

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:17.066
- Let's just kiss some more, okay?
- What's wrong?

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:22.321
Nothing's wrong.
I just don't want to make love.

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:30.579
I love to be with you.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:35.000
I love it when you kiss me
and when you touch me,

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:39.004
but when you make love, you go to work.

01:02:42.551 --> 01:02:44.695
Look, if it's your period, it's okay.
I don't mind. I love it.

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:48.180
Don't give me that crap.
You know what I'm talking about.

01:02:48.557 --> 01:02:50.808
I can't give you any pleasure,

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:53.519
and you can't fool me any more.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.271
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:58.065
Yes, I do. And so do you.

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:12.204
Yeah, I know.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:17.585
You're talking about me
giving up what I am,

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:19.128
what I do.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:21.714
Is that so shocking?

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:31.515
I care about you. I really do.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:40.191
That's still not enough.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.156
It's all I'm good at.

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:49.909
That's not true.

01:03:51.912 --> 01:03:54.455
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:57.708
I can't quit anyhow.
If I quit, I'm out on a limb.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:02.421
Well, then we'd be even.
I'm already out on one.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:10.638
People I know take care of each other.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.101
I need their protection.

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:23.359
I'm being framed by somebody.

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:25.110
I don't know who.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:30.449
There was a murder, Palm Springs,
a couple weeks ago.

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:33.953
Police think I did it.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.956
It was a woman.

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:39.250
A woman I met once.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:43.546
I wasn't there,
but my alibi completely denies it.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.631
Why would anyone
want to do that to you?

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:49.176
I can't figure that out. I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.428
When was the murder?

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:53.264
A week ago Tuesday.

01:04:56.268 --> 01:04:58.602
Weren't we together that night?

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:01.313
Baby, I wish we were.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:18.664
All right, boys, stand full-face, please.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.082
This is bullshit. These cops...

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.793
Number three, take off your glasses.

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:28.674
Number two, straighten up.

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.635
Turn to your right.

01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:36.807
No, number three, to your right.

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:38.350
Jerk.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.561
How much you getting paid?

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:44.315
What are you talking about?
I'm just a con.

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:45.733
So am I.

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.860
I'm getting 15.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:51.363
- You are?
- Yeah, 15 bucks.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.365
Now left, please.

01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:58.037
Left.

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:01.915
Thank you.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.213
- The wino's getting 20.
- You're kidding.

01:06:09.758 --> 01:06:11.842
You ain't getting paid,
you're getting screwed.

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:14.970
Shit! What the fuck is going on here?
Is my lawyer here yet?

01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:16.365
- I want to speak to my lawyer...
- Four!

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.742
When he gets here!
Make sure they call me.

01:06:17.766 --> 01:06:20.392
Four. You'll see your lawyer.
Get back in line.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:23.062
Now, just make sure I speak to him.

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:25.606
Number one, turn to your right again.

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:26.732
I know my rights.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.962
- This isn't Russia.
- Okay, number one, turn to your left.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:32.488
We have a constitution here.
I know my rights.

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:34.300
- Wait till my lawyer gets here.
- All right, thank you.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.866
You all can leave now.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.702
How about this fucking jerk here, three?
Is he getting paid?

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:41.330
Hey, you!
Are you getting paid, too?

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:43.415
What the fuck is going on?

01:06:46.086 --> 01:06:48.045
Well, what do you think?

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.383
- Not bad.
- I'm gonna steal your thunder.

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:54.718
He's teaching me how to dress.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:58.263
This is Lieutenant Curtis
from Palm Springs.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:06:59.556
He's...

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:02.685
He's in charge of this case.

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:04.937
Wait a minute. I thought you were.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:07.815
No, not me. I'm in charge
of pimps, prostitutes and hustlers.

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:11.318
They keep me pretty low on the pole.
Good joke?

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:18.617
You've been identified, Julian.

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:22.162
- Julian.
- By whom?

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.873
Who could possibly identify me?

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.501
You parked your Mercedes
about 50 feet from the Rheiman house

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:30.254
between 9:30 and 10:00
on the night of the 22nd.

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:33.882
Then you proceeded up the street,
entered the house.

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:37.845
- Someone saw you, Julian.
- I request formal charges...

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:40.347
I don't understand. I don't know
who would say this about me.

01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:42.808
- Now, he's been apprised of his rights!
- I was not there.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.769
Then she identified subject number one.

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:50.941
Then she wasn't sure
which one of you it was.

01:07:56.156 --> 01:07:58.866
- You got the license number?
- She didn't see it.

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:00.617
- Shit!
- Right.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:02.828
Here.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.435
We looked around your house
the other day. We had a warrant.

01:08:07.459 --> 01:08:09.835
- We know.
- You recognize these?

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:11.545
No.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.380
- They were under your mattress.
- So what?

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:18.010
They had Mrs Rheiman's fingerprints
all over it. That's so what.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:21.180
- Did you find the jewels?
- What jewels?

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:24.683
I read the paper, too.
Jewels stolen from Rheiman's house.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:27.770
Whoever planted that money
probably planted the jewels, too.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:29.688
There were no jewels.

01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:33.024
Didn't you ever wonder
this whole thing may be a frame?

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.859
It occurred to us.

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.529
It occurred to you.

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:40.573
- Did you check out Rheiman himself?
- He has an alibi.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.243
Big deal, he's got an alibi. What about...

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:44.620
You're grasping at straws.

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:46.640
What about Leon James, the black guy
sent me out to Rheiman's?

01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:50.292
He spoke very highly of you.
He said you were a high-class act.

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.211
And what do you think?

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:02.220
I think you're guilty as sin.

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:04.598
I think you went to the Rheimans',

01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:07.810
I think you did a trick,
played some rough games.

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:11.354
You got drugged or stupid or both.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:15.692
I think you beat her, you killed her,
stole the money and the jewels.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:21.156
Then there's no use to talk any more
until you press charges.

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:25.327
Even though we think Julian's guilty,
we're not gonna arrest him.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.287
If you are being framed,

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:30.832
you're gonna be a lot more use to us
floating around.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.921
Can we go now?

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:50.102
Just one more thing, Julian.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.774
Don't tell cons they get paid for line-ups.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:59.027
Some cops don't have
a sense of humor. You know that.

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:01.089
- Hi.
- Yes?

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:04.051
I'm here to see Mrs Williams.
My name is Julian Kay.

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:06.511
That's all right, Wilma.
I'll take care of it.

01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:08.513
- Hi.
- Hello, Julian.

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:13.060
- Why are you here?
- Can I talk to you?

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:15.020
What do you want to talk about?

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.691
Were the police here?

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.610
There was a detective here.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:24.363
I was very surprised you used my name.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.825
I'm very, very sorry about that, Lisa,

01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:32.371
but this is very important to me.

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:34.790
I told him the truth.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:39.586
Lisa, you didn't tell him the truth.
I was with you until after midnight.

01:11:39.671 --> 01:11:41.463
That's not the truth.

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:43.507
Julian, I can't...

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.385
You weren't here.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.261
What is it, dear?

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:50.180
This is Julian Kay,

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:53.141
the one who is helping
with the decorating.

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:57.312
He's the boy who told the police
he was with me the night of that murder.

01:11:57.397 --> 01:11:59.272
So, you're Mr Kay.

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:03.360
It's bad enough you made a fool
of my wife at Parke Bernet,

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:05.654
but then you start spreading these lies?

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:07.990
- Leave us alone.
- I wasn't lying.

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:10.158
I don't know what you did.
I don't want to know.

01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:12.596
Whatever it is, you're not going
to get out of it by dragging...

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.414
Truth. I just came here for the truth.
That's all.

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:19.710
- I know you're lying.
- How do you know I'm lying?

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:24.840
Because I was here with my wife
the entire evening.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.509
Thank you, Mr Kay.

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:35.512
You're really not very good at this,
you know?

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:37.788
- What?
- Following people, pal!

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:39.539
In fact, you're lousy.

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:41.208
Who are you?
What are you talking about?

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:42.501
Who's paying you?

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:45.128
You're not a cop, are you? You can't be.
Leon. It's Leon, right?

01:13:45.213 --> 01:13:47.881
- I'm calling the police.
- You want to call? Go ahead, good, call.

01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:51.259
You want a dime? I'll give you a dime.
What have we got here?

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:54.096
- Give me that!
- Floyd... Floyd Wicker. Nice name.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.473
Born 7-23-52.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:58.558
Hawthorne Avenue, LA.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:00.811
Driver's license, American Express,

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.772
Master Charge, picture of girlfriend...

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:07.150
So-so, eyes too close together, Floyd.

01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:09.277
What else have we got here?

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.822
We got California State
Congressional Library pass,

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:14.908
California State
identification, California...

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:18.620
State senate pass.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.997
Senator Charles Stratton.

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:24.876
- Who the fuck are you?
- You can read, can't you?

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:30.382
Here.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:32.717
You work for Senator Stratton?

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:35.846
Yes.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:41.726
- Why are you following me, Floyd?
- I was told to.

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:44.229
- By who? The Senator?
- Who else?

01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:47.459
If the Senator wanted to know
about my private life,

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.776
why didn't he ask me himself?

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:54.865
You don't know. You don't know.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:58.577
Well, I'll tell you what, Floyd,
I'm gonna make this easy for you.

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:00.704
I'm gonna make it real easy,
so you don't forget.

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:02.747
This is my telephone number.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:07.419
Now you tell the Senator,
if he wants to talk to me,

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:11.173
he can just give me a call, all right?

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:14.593
Now you fuck off and leave me alone!

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.792
I received your message, Mr Kay.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.881
- Thought I'd come see you in person.
- Good evening, Senator.

01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:54.610
Yes, I'll have a vodka and tonic,
Charles, please.

01:15:54.634 --> 01:15:55.884
Yes, sir.

01:15:58.012 --> 01:15:59.888
This is heart-warming.

01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:04.017
It's nice to see you haven't lost touch
with your constituency.

01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:07.145
I'm not talking as a senator now.
I'm talking as a husband.

01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:10.315
That's too bad. I'm not a wife.

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:13.652
Very funny.

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:16.154
What do you want?

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:18.365
Want?

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:22.285
I know who you are.
I can't stop my wife from being a fool.

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:26.289
But I can stop her
from being blackmailed.

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:32.671
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:35.006
You don't?

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.445
The police think you're involved
in a murder in Palm Springs

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:40.011
a week ago.

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:42.472
Three days later,
you saw my wife at a fundraiser

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:44.266
and seduced her.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.394
You think you can blackmail me
into helping you?

01:16:49.689 --> 01:16:51.523
You're crazy, mister.

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:53.191
Am I?

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:10.000
Last night, my wife asked me
about the Rheiman murder.

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:14.129
It didn't make any sense
until I heard about you.

01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:17.549
You talked to Michelle about this?

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.531
You're not gonna blackmail me!
You can spread...

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:24.681
You don't know
anything about this, Mister.

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:27.309
But I do know a whore when I see one.

01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:29.561
How much?

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:34.357
Not to see your wife again?

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:41.072
Five thousand.

01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:47.454
You'll have the cash in the morning.

01:17:52.293 --> 01:17:55.170
I'm seeing Michelle
because I want to see her

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.590
and because she wants to see me.

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:03.595
I don't want a dime from you,
or anyone like you.

01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:18.443
Let me be even simpler.

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:22.238
You live off the good graces
of a small number of people.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:26.034
Like Mrs Andrews,
who was just at the door a minute ago.

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:29.245
And the good graces of places
such as this.

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:32.248
You're just a hanger-on.

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:35.710
Unless you want to find a new crowd
to hang on to,

01:18:35.795 --> 01:18:37.796
don't see my wife again.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:43.236
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- Not bad. How about you?

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:46.531
I'm looking for Leon James.
Is he around?

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:49.325
Yeah. He's probably at the Probe.

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:51.953
Okay. Thanks. Take care.

01:20:23.194 --> 01:20:24.569
Hi, Julian.

01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:19.624
Hey, Jason.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:21.674
Julian, I haven't seen you
in a long time here.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.271
What brings you to this
neck of the woods?

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:25.065
I'm looking for Leon.
Have you seen him around?

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:26.297
Leon? Yeah, he was here.

01:21:26.423 --> 01:21:29.425
He was showing off his new little boy.
A cute little blond kid.

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:32.220
I think he's over there someplace.

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:34.055
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:55.535
Hey, Julie! I thought that was you.

01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:56.619
Homecoming?

01:21:56.704 --> 01:21:58.454
I've been looking for you. I wanna talk.

01:21:58.539 --> 01:22:00.081
Let's go out back where it's quiet.

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:01.165
Okay.

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.334
What're you doing here?

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:08.131
You coming from a funeral?

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:11.926
I hear you're showing off
a new boy here, Leon.

01:22:12.011 --> 01:22:15.597
Got to make sure none of these fruits
snatch him from me, too.

01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:23.104
You heard anything
about the Rheiman killing?

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:24.981
That's all I've been hearing about.

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:27.859
Cops on my ass like white on rice.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.111
They're giving me
the third degree, Leon.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:32.322
Everybody else, too, Julie.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:37.910
I may need your help.
I don't have an alibi.

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:41.372
You're the one that sent me.

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:44.751
You need one?

01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:46.961
Yeah.

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.006
I'll see what I can do.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.516
Who do you think killed her?

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:05.563
Well, if I was the police, I'd be more
interested in Rheiman himself.

01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:07.440
He's a freak, you know?

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:12.445
Yeah, he's a freak. But he's got an alibi.

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:14.030
An alibi?

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:19.327
Hey, Julie.
I got something working tonight.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:20.495
Little thing, you know.

01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:23.539
I thought I'd cut you in on it.
If you're interested, let me know.

01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:25.083
Straight?

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:27.043
At this time of night? Are you serious?

01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:31.839
Leon, I'm sick of doing your shit.

01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:33.526
I mean, I'm sick of it! No more fag stuff.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.511
No more kink. Nothing. Finito. Got it?

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:38.763
I heard about your problems.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:41.140
What problems?

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.394
Your clientele, Julie. Your rich pussy.

01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:48.523
They won't touch you. Say it's too hot.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.358
They're looking for new boys.

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.610
Fuck them! Fuck them!

01:23:53.112 --> 01:23:55.113
Hey, Julie, listen.

01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:59.325
You ask me
to help you out of a tight spot.

01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:01.035
I'm glad to do it.

01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:04.997
But I ask you to do my trick,
you tell me no.

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:08.292
Well, how do you expect me
to help you?

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:15.508
You give me the alibi,
and then we'll talk about tricks.

01:24:37.156 --> 01:24:38.281
I have to talk to you.

01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:41.659
Hey, baby! Oh, God!
I'm glad to see you!

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:47.665
You okay? You better be.
You look so worn out.

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:49.751
I didn't get much sleep.

01:24:50.377 --> 01:24:52.920
- You wanna go for a walk?
- Yeah.

01:24:53.297 --> 01:24:55.339
Okay, let me get my shoes.

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:01.554
What's wrong?

01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:04.348
Are you gonna tell me about it?

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:10.021
Hey!

01:25:11.648 --> 01:25:13.441
Hey! You.

01:25:18.864 --> 01:25:20.615
Come on. Tell me.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:25.286
When I said I didn't want
to make love to you the other day,

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:27.038
I didn't mean it.

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:30.374
I want to fuck you.
I always want to fuck you.

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:43.304
Is that what you came to tell me?

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:44.639
No.

01:25:45.599 --> 01:25:48.810
Charles asked me
to leave for two months.

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:51.229
Till the primaries are over.

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:52.980
I'm going to Rome.

01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:59.111
Two months.

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:04.992
I'll be back! Wait for me.

01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:11.374
I don't know if I can.

01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:14.604
- The police searched my apartment...
- Maybe Charles could help.

01:26:14.628 --> 01:26:16.754
Don't... That's not what I'm saying!

01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:27.932
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.319
All my life I've been
looking for something.

01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:42.780
I don't even know what it is.

01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:45.825
- Let me do it...
- Maybe you're what I'm looking for.

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:53.291
I gave Charles my word.

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:56.043
I've got to go.

01:26:57.421 --> 01:26:59.130
It'll be all right.

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:03.551
Yeah.

01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:05.803
I have to leave.

01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:41.662
Shit!

01:33:11.836 --> 01:33:14.463
I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:17.633
- Tell me.
- I don't know. Honest. I'd tell you.

01:33:18.468 --> 01:33:20.928
The police have been here all morning.
His room's a mess.

01:33:21.012 --> 01:33:23.681
There's another cop waiting in his room.

01:33:23.765 --> 01:33:26.809
- Does he call in?
- I'm not supposed to tell.

01:33:27.143 --> 01:33:30.771
Okay, next time he calls in,
tell him that I've got to talk to him.

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:31.939
Tell him it's important.

01:33:32.023 --> 01:33:33.743
Ask him if there's someplace
I can meet him.

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:47.871
Do you know a blond kid

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:49.373
that hangs around
with Leon James?

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:52.042
Nah. Couldn't tell you.

01:33:53.837 --> 01:33:55.713
Eat shit, asshole.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:09.977
Anne, I'm sorry.

01:34:11.438 --> 01:34:13.355
I've got to talk to you.

01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:16.483
I can't now. I'm looking for somebody.

01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:21.030
Perino's? Look, I don't have time! I...

01:34:21.865 --> 01:34:23.175
Yeah, all right. All right. Perino's.

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:24.742
Yes. 8:30.

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:40.924
Jill? It's Julian.

01:34:43.094 --> 01:34:46.055
Yeah, I know, I know.
Got some messages for me?

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.310
Michelle?

01:34:55.774 --> 01:34:58.067
Tell her to meet me at Perino's.

01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:04.531
Son of a bitch, it's Rheiman.

01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:41.235
Mr Julian! You can't come in like this.

01:35:41.444 --> 01:35:42.861
I was working. I forgot my tie.

01:35:42.946 --> 01:35:46.240
- I'll have to give you a jacket.
- No, it's okay.

01:35:52.747 --> 01:35:54.915
Julie. You look like shit. What's wrong?

01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:57.042
Everything. Straight bourbon.

01:35:57.627 --> 01:35:58.836
What're you doing to yourself?

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:02.423
The way you look now,
you couldn't get a maid to fuck you!

01:36:02.507 --> 01:36:04.508
Anne, I need your help.

01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:06.510
The cops are after me.

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:07.947
They're framing me
for the Rheiman murder.

01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:09.471
Where have you been?

01:36:09.556 --> 01:36:12.349
- I was looking for somebody.
- Last night?

01:36:13.017 --> 01:36:14.935
- What do you mean?
- Mrs Vakklar.

01:36:15.019 --> 01:36:17.187
She came in last night
on a flight from Stockholm.

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:18.332
And she only speaks Swedish.

01:36:18.356 --> 01:36:20.543
Nobody could understand her
and there was no one there to meet her.

01:36:20.567 --> 01:36:21.648
- Anne...
- She was furious!

01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:23.504
The auto people are furious.
Now I've got hell to pay!

01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:24.797
Now what happened?
Didn't you prepare?

01:36:24.821 --> 01:36:26.613
Didn't you hear me?

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:29.366
I said the cops are after me!
For murder!

01:36:29.826 --> 01:36:31.702
So, you stand me up?

01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:34.705
Jesus Christ.

01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:38.250
What do you want?

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.632
Are you gonna help me?

01:36:47.302 --> 01:36:50.429
I've checked around, Julie.
You are in trouble!

01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:53.348
That's why I need your help.

01:36:53.433 --> 01:36:55.392
You never did anything for me.

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:58.353
I never did anything for you...

01:36:58.438 --> 01:37:01.148
What are you talking about?
I'm your number one boy!

01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:03.233
And you fight me every turn.

01:37:03.359 --> 01:37:07.571
You ask a favor, and then stand up
a gig I worked for six months to set up!

01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:09.406
I explained that already. I told you.

01:37:09.491 --> 01:37:11.033
I'm through with you, Julie.

01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:14.036
You'll have to fend for yourself.

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.914
I don't care
what happens to you any more.

01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:31.720
Excuse me. I'll be back in a second.

01:37:45.568 --> 01:37:48.028
Julian. Thank God you got my message.

01:37:48.112 --> 01:37:49.738
I've been looking for you all day.

01:37:49.822 --> 01:37:52.366
It's all right, baby. It's okay.

01:37:53.159 --> 01:37:56.328
No. No, it's not all right.
Charles talked to the D.A.

01:37:56.412 --> 01:37:59.540
They've found the murder weapon.
They're gonna arrest you.

01:37:59.874 --> 01:38:01.416
That can't be.

01:38:02.794 --> 01:38:04.628
What're you gonna do?

01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:07.756
I don't know.

01:38:12.428 --> 01:38:14.429
What can I do to help you?

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:17.891
- There's nothing you can do.
- There's gotta be something.

01:38:17.976 --> 01:38:20.811
Don't you understand?
I am in big trouble!

01:38:21.479 --> 01:38:23.814
- Just stay away from me!
- No!

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:26.316
It's gonna be a scandal.
You know what a scandal is?

01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:28.151
You know what that's like?

01:38:28.695 --> 01:38:31.446
Just stay away from me.
I'll ruin your life.

01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:33.949
Your husband's. It's all over.

01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:35.951
Not if you're innocent.

01:38:37.662 --> 01:38:39.306
If I'm innocent?
How do you know I'm innocent?

01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:42.291
- But you are...
- Look at me, right in the face!

01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:46.211
Can you tell me, without hesitation,
you know I'm innocent?

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:47.462
Yes.

01:38:54.345 --> 01:38:57.306
- You see... Forget me.
- Is someone in there?

01:38:57.432 --> 01:38:59.391
I never loved you.

01:41:15.695 --> 01:41:18.113
- Julie.
- Let me in. It's important.

01:41:22.869 --> 01:41:25.036
Julie, you look terrible.

01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:27.706
Hey, listen, you wanna clean up?
Get a shave?

01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:30.584
I'm sorry to bug you
this time of the morning.

01:41:30.668 --> 01:41:32.544
I've been looking for you.

01:41:34.672 --> 01:41:36.214
I'm listening.

01:41:38.176 --> 01:41:41.845
You got my alibi ready?
I'm gonna need it today.

01:41:42.555 --> 01:41:45.098
It's not ready yet, Julie. Tomorrow.

01:41:45.183 --> 01:41:47.017
I'm still piecing it together.

01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:50.437
It's not easy, you know.

01:41:50.521 --> 01:41:52.241
I'm just trying, you know, to get it right.

01:41:52.315 --> 01:41:55.066
- Why are you trying to frame me?
- What're you talking about?

01:41:55.151 --> 01:41:57.819
Judy Rheiman's murder.
You're behind it.

01:41:58.279 --> 01:42:00.447
You, Rheiman,

01:42:02.074 --> 01:42:05.327
your cute little blond boyfriend
in the bedroom there.

01:42:05.411 --> 01:42:07.329
The one who planted the jewels
in my car!

01:42:07.413 --> 01:42:09.539
I don't know what you're talking about!

01:42:09.624 --> 01:42:10.976
You don't know what I'm talking about.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.210
What the fuck is that, then?

01:42:14.253 --> 01:42:16.421
He's the one
that actually killed her, isn't he?

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:22.177
Leon, what happened?
You sent him out there.

01:42:22.261 --> 01:42:25.388
You sent him out there, he got into
a scene with Rheiman and his wife.

01:42:25.473 --> 01:42:28.141
He got rough, and he killed her.

01:42:28.226 --> 01:42:30.352
You shut your fucking face!

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:33.563
I never saw that shit before in my life!

01:42:33.689 --> 01:42:36.358
Look, I wanna know one thing from you.

01:42:36.442 --> 01:42:39.611
How much is it gonna cost me
to get you off my back?

01:42:39.737 --> 01:42:43.073
You ain't talking money,
you're talking murder.

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:45.367
- How much?
- I feel sorry for you, Julie.

01:42:45.451 --> 01:42:46.827
How much?

01:42:48.412 --> 01:42:51.706
It don't make no difference
how much, Julie.

01:42:51.791 --> 01:42:55.669
The other side will always pay more.

01:43:13.771 --> 01:43:16.022
You got it on real tight?

01:43:20.945 --> 01:43:23.780
Real proud of yourself,
aren't you, Leon?

01:43:24.448 --> 01:43:28.368
The police found the murder weapon
a block from your apartment.

01:43:29.245 --> 01:43:33.748
And that bitch in Palm Springs
is gonna change her mind anytime now

01:43:33.833 --> 01:43:36.251
and identify you.

01:43:37.461 --> 01:43:40.422
Police want you real bad, Julie.

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:42.799
Now they got you.

01:44:00.651 --> 01:44:04.321
Look, I'm worth maybe 20, 30 grand.
It's yours.

01:44:09.911 --> 01:44:12.203
I'll break in new boys for you.

01:44:15.708 --> 01:44:17.626
I'll work just for you!

01:44:18.169 --> 01:44:20.170
Just for you, Leon!

01:44:20.463 --> 01:44:22.339
40-60 split.

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.549
That's fair. 40-60.

01:44:26.135 --> 01:44:27.469
40...

01:44:29.138 --> 01:44:30.722
30-70.

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:34.851
I'll do fag tricks for you.

01:44:34.936 --> 01:44:38.188
I'll do kink.
I'll do anything you want me to do!

01:44:40.399 --> 01:44:43.693
Leave me alone and get out, Julie.

01:44:50.368 --> 01:44:51.660
Why me?

01:44:54.038 --> 01:44:55.747
Why did you pick me?

01:44:58.042 --> 01:45:01.336
Because you were frameable, Julie.

01:45:04.006 --> 01:45:06.716
You stepped on too many toes.

01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:09.844
Nobody cared about you.

01:45:10.805 --> 01:45:13.598
I never liked you much myself.

01:45:15.893 --> 01:45:17.727
Now get out.

01:45:23.985 --> 01:45:25.652
Who's down there?

01:45:28.072 --> 01:45:30.865
Your new boyfriend? You motherfucker!

01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:32.075
You...

01:45:34.578 --> 01:45:37.497
Oh, my God! Help!

01:45:37.581 --> 01:45:40.500
Listen, don't let me fall!
Please, Julie, help me!

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:43.753
- Don't let me fall!
- Don't fall. Leon, I need you!

01:45:44.839 --> 01:45:46.047
Give me your hand.

01:45:46.132 --> 01:45:49.134
- Try. At least try.
- I can't. I'm trying.

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.678
Help me! Help me, please!

01:45:51.762 --> 01:45:54.848
God! Don't fall!

01:47:10.007 --> 01:47:11.966
Julian, would you
answer a few questions?

01:47:14.136 --> 01:47:16.054
How many times
have you been to Palm Springs?

01:47:17.389 --> 01:47:19.849
How long were you
seeing Mrs Rheiman?

01:47:22.853 --> 01:47:24.604
Any Hollywood notables...

01:47:24.688 --> 01:47:26.231
How much money
have you made, Julian?

01:47:26.315 --> 01:47:27.774
Go ahead and give me
an exclusive?

01:47:27.858 --> 01:47:29.018
Who're you trying to protect?

01:47:29.026 --> 01:47:32.195
- How much did you get for a trick?
- Please. Please. Come on, Julian.

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:33.919
Is it true you're getting a plea bargain?

01:47:37.868 --> 01:47:40.120
Why would you make a statement?

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.984
I wish I had arrested you earlier.

01:48:11.068 --> 01:48:13.027
It would have been easier for everybody.

01:48:13.112 --> 01:48:15.655
You'd better put an end
to this pre-trial publicity.

01:48:16.574 --> 01:48:19.242
We'll be moving him
to Palm Springs soon.

01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:23.997
Do you have anything to say, Julian?

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:36.551
Julian?

01:48:41.432 --> 01:48:42.515
No.

01:49:17.176 --> 01:49:18.676
Hello, Julian.

01:49:20.679 --> 01:49:22.597
Going away on your trip?

01:49:22.681 --> 01:49:24.474
No, I decided not to.

01:49:27.728 --> 01:49:30.647
- Does your husband know you're here?
- No.

01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:34.651
Why did you come?

01:49:37.613 --> 01:49:40.657
I didn't think
I was ever going to see you again.

01:49:45.329 --> 01:49:47.330
Don't come back, Michelle.

01:49:55.631 --> 01:49:58.174
Are you satisfied with your lawyer?

01:49:59.677 --> 01:50:01.344
It doesn't matter.

01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:04.555
Don't go.

01:50:28.747 --> 01:50:32.125
Michelle Stratton is paying
for my services, Julian.

01:50:32.918 --> 01:50:36.087
I think you know
this is a matter of some secrecy.

01:50:40.759 --> 01:50:42.677
Tell her not to bother.

01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:45.346
Julian, you'll have to help us more.

01:50:48.809 --> 01:50:51.102
You tell Michelle to forget me.

01:50:53.689 --> 01:50:58.776
I'm more worried about your defense,
Julian, than about her private life.

01:51:00.154 --> 01:51:04.240
We'll have to go into all the details
of the night of the murder.

01:51:04.575 --> 01:51:07.785
A maid saw you trying to save Leon,

01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:10.413
so the police are only pressing
the Rheiman case.

01:51:10.956 --> 01:51:14.334
The papers and TV
are trying you already, Julian.

01:51:15.127 --> 01:51:17.879
The police aren't
investigating any more.

01:51:18.255 --> 01:51:19.672
We need some help,

01:51:19.757 --> 01:51:23.301
some facts to get
the investigation going again.

01:51:24.428 --> 01:51:27.347
Then we can find out
about Leon, Rheiman.

01:51:27.431 --> 01:51:28.556
Maybe the blond boy.

01:51:30.559 --> 01:51:32.393
How about it, Julian?

01:51:47.951 --> 01:51:51.496
- Lieutenant Curtis?
- Yes, Mrs Stratton. This is an honor.

01:51:52.164 --> 01:51:53.790
May I sit?

01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:58.086
I was told you wanted to see me.
What can I do for you?

01:51:58.170 --> 01:52:02.465
I want to talk to you about
the Julian Kay/Rheiman murder case.

01:52:03.384 --> 01:52:04.467
Yes.

01:52:04.968 --> 01:52:07.345
I'm paying for Mr Kay's legal defense.

01:52:08.972 --> 01:52:10.473
I know.

01:52:11.475 --> 01:52:14.644
I'm paying for Mr Kay's defense
because I know he's not guilty.

01:52:14.812 --> 01:52:17.230
And I don't want to see
an obstruction of justice.

01:52:17.314 --> 01:52:19.649
How do you know he's not guilty?

01:52:20.401 --> 01:52:23.528
Because he was not in Palm Springs
the night of the murder.

01:52:23.612 --> 01:52:25.321
- No?
- No.

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:27.865
He was with me.

01:52:43.549 --> 01:52:45.508
I told them, Julian.

01:52:46.635 --> 01:52:47.969
I heard.

01:52:50.973 --> 01:52:53.641
You didn't have to do that, Michelle.

01:52:54.435 --> 01:52:56.185
You could have forgotten me.

01:52:56.770 --> 01:52:58.521
I'd rather die.

01:53:03.068 --> 01:53:04.861
What will you do now?

01:53:06.029 --> 01:53:07.655
I don't know.

01:53:08.031 --> 01:53:09.574
I can't go home.

01:53:10.951 --> 01:53:13.161
The newsmen are waiting
outside for me.

01:53:13.245 --> 01:53:15.037
There's dozens of them.

01:53:20.544 --> 01:53:22.211
Why did you do it?

01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:26.382
I had no choice.

01:53:27.384 --> 01:53:29.010
I love you.

01:53:38.395 --> 01:53:40.229
Oh, my God, Michelle.

01:53:42.274 --> 01:53:45.067
It's taken me so long to come to you.
