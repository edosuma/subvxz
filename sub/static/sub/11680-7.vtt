00:00.600 --> 00:02.190
My name is Michael Westen.

00:02.200 --> 00:04.700
I used to be a spy until...

00:04.730 --> 00:07.850
We got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.880 --> 00:12.680
When you're burned, you've got nothing... 
no cash, no credit, no job history.

00:12.720 --> 00:15.010
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:15.050 --> 00:17.040
Where am I?
Miami.

00:17.180 --> 00:20.080
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.090 --> 00:23.380
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you.

00:23.410 --> 00:24.830
A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...

00:24.840 --> 00:26.030
Should we shoot them?

00:26.040 --> 00:28.600
An old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...

00:28.610 --> 00:31.300
You know spies... a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.310 --> 00:32.060
Family, too...

00:32.070 --> 00:33.240
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:33.250 --> 00:34.500
If you're desperate.

00:34.510 --> 00:36.060
Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.070 --> 00:40.830
Bottom line... as long as you're
burned, you're not going anywhere.

00:54.340 --> 00:56.700
Spies aren't much into nightclubs.

00:56.710 --> 00:59.960
In a career where hearing loss
is a serious operational concern

00:59.970 --> 01:02.830
and crowds of strangers have
to be constantly monitored, 

01:02.840 --> 01:05.680
they just don't seem like much fun.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.730
I'm just saying you live above
the club. Aren't you curious?

01:08.740 --> 01:10.000
You can hear the music through the floor.

01:10.010 --> 01:12.420
Sam's got beer in the fridge. Knock yourself out.

01:12.430 --> 01:13.900
We're just back there.

01:13.940 --> 01:17.460
You know, it's not the same when no one's watching.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.390
Uh, the line to the club's out there.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.020
I'm here for you.

01:25.030 --> 01:25.830
Excuse me?

01:25.840 --> 01:28.060
Excuse me.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.000
This is for you.

01:30.010 --> 01:32.370
It's rejuvenating body lotion.

01:32.380 --> 01:34.400
A gift from a friend.

01:34.410 --> 01:36.510
I can apply itif you'd like.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.200
That won't be necessary.

01:40.890 --> 01:44.230
Who's this friend giving you rejuvenating body lotion?

01:44.240 --> 01:45.230
He's not a friend.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.560
He's a recruiter.

01:46.570 --> 01:48.330
Oh, Strickler.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.020
I can apply it if you want.

01:52.430 --> 01:57.110
Training a covert operative takes
years and costs a lot of money.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.890
In theory, it's all for the taxpayers who pay the bills.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.990
In practice, it's worth a lot on the open market.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.580
And when something's that valuable,
there's always someone trying to sell it.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.720
Oh, you didn't like the lotion.

02:14.030 --> 02:16.000
It's organic. Best money can buy.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.200
You know, I'm all set with lotion right now.

02:18.210 --> 02:20.730
Like I told you before, I'm not interested in your money.

02:20.740 --> 02:21.920
This isn't about money.

02:21.930 --> 02:23.320
Did you even look at the lotion?

02:23.330 --> 02:26.750
It's 40% aloe vera. They say it's great for burns.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.620
Want a mimosa?

02:29.490 --> 02:32.860
So, uh, it's all about the burn notice with you, isn't it?

02:32.870 --> 02:35.320
Well, I might be able to help out with that.

02:35.330 --> 02:37.560
How's that? With moisturizer?

02:38.410 --> 02:44.550
Remember that NSA logistics guy who got caught up
in the Panamanian banking scandal a couple years back?

02:45.310 --> 02:46.960
Rings a bell.

02:46.980 --> 02:49.020
Should have ended his career.

02:49.050 --> 02:54.300
But he had a second chance because of a conversation
he had with the right person on a ski lift in Aspen.

02:54.310 --> 02:55.710
I know, 'cause I was there.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.270
If we were working together, I'd be there for you, too.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.860
As your mercenary?

02:59.870 --> 03:01.260
No, I'm not interested.

03:01.270 --> 03:03.100
As a friend.

03:03.110 --> 03:05.660
Friends do each other favors.

03:05.710 --> 03:08.930
Listen, Michael, we all know what's
at the top of your Christmas list.

03:08.940 --> 03:13.550
Work with me, I can deliver that list to Santa himself.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.290
Spies hate drop-in visits.

03:20.300 --> 03:24.100
Any questionable contact has
to be reported to superiors.

03:24.110 --> 03:28.530
A process that involves hours of
paperwork and uncomfortable questions.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.080
If you're a questionable contact,
that gives you some leverage.

03:33.090 --> 03:38.410
If you know where a spy operates, even a guy
running a lowly import/export cover business...

03:38.420 --> 03:39.740
Diego!

03:39.750 --> 03:41.800
You can make someone's life miserable.

03:41.810 --> 03:42.680
What are you doing here?

03:42.690 --> 03:47.420
What? I can't just drop by and say
hi to my favorite "point of contact"?

03:50.170 --> 03:51.640
I thought it was clear last time we spoke, 

03:51.650 --> 03:55.430
if anyone from the intelligence community
has anything to share, I'll call you.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.890
I know, I know, I know. I need a favor.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.280
I'm already doing you a favor by not calling the police.

03:59.290 --> 04:00.390
Another favor, then.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.680
There's a name I need you to
check out... Tom Strickler.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.810
He offered to help out with this whole burn notice thing.

04:05.820 --> 04:08.280
I need you to find out if he's
a guy who can make things happen.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.260
Maybe you should Google him...

04:10.270 --> 04:12.830
or go find someone who cares.

04:13.990 --> 04:15.420
See? Now you have to care.

04:15.430 --> 04:20.790
I let the local Homeland Security office know that
I was dropping by and leaving that document there.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.900
I'll check in later.

04:28.850 --> 04:30.720
You don't even know this Strickler.

04:30.730 --> 04:32.290
What makes you think he has this kind of clout?

04:32.300 --> 04:33.820
Well, that's what I need to figure out.

04:33.830 --> 04:35.370
Can we talk about something else?

04:35.380 --> 04:37.420
No. I'm cooking at my place.

04:37.430 --> 04:41.030
I get to choose the topic of conversation.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.110
You seriously think he's gonna wave
his magic spy wand and get you back in?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.680
It's a little more complicated than that, Fi.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.190
Well, in my experience, if something seems too good
to be true, it's best to shoot it, just in case.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.800
One way or another, I need to check him out.

04:50.810 --> 04:53.380
If he's half as connected as he claimed, I need to know.

04:53.390 --> 04:54.930
You're not actually considering his offer?

04:54.940 --> 04:56.530
Michael, the guy is sleazy... 
Fi.

04:56.540 --> 04:58.560
Don't change the subject. I want to know... 

04:58.570 --> 05:01.250
Were you expecting a guest?

05:03.950 --> 05:08.970
If you want to stay alive, you have to be
able to recognize the signs of a break-in.

05:10.940 --> 05:18.900
The most skilled operative in the world won't last long
if he walks into an ambush carrying a box of cereal.

05:21.460 --> 05:26.280
When a target is cornered, the best strategy
is to flush them into a choke point, 

05:26.290 --> 05:29.720
where they have two options... surrender, or be shot.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.170
Drop it!

05:31.180 --> 05:36.400
Of course, if your target turns out to be
13 years old carrying a dismantled pistol, 

05:36.410 --> 05:39.860
it changes the tactical response somewhat.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.060
Hey, all right.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.500
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

06:07.510 --> 06:10.280
Look, man, I'm sorry! I was
just gonna borrow it, I swear!

06:10.300 --> 06:12.610
Yeah, you "borrow"a cup of sugar.
You don't borrow a gun.

06:12.620 --> 06:13.800
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to call your parents.

06:13.810 --> 06:15.370
You don't understand, man! I have to... 

06:15.420 --> 06:16.840
You have to what?

06:16.850 --> 06:18.830
Look, just... just let me go, man.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.940
I will when you answer me.

06:21.950 --> 06:24.870
I... I have to kill my stepdad.

06:41.320 --> 06:45.080
You're gonna have to tell us your mom's name
at some point, unless you plan on living here.

06:45.090 --> 06:46.050
I don't recommend it.

06:46.060 --> 06:50.200
I can only cook a few things, and
the air-conditioning's iffy.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.430
Tell you what, why don't we start with what's going on?

06:53.440 --> 06:56.120
Look, you wouldn't understand.

06:56.130 --> 06:58.280
You want to shoot your stepdad.

06:58.290 --> 07:01.070
I'm guessing he did more than make you go to bed early.

07:01.080 --> 07:05.970
He's trying to take me and my brother
away from my mother, and nobody's helping.

07:05.980 --> 07:07.260
You know, she's done everything she could.

07:07.270 --> 07:10.940
I saw her taking gun oil and
cleaning stuff out of her car.

07:10.950 --> 07:11.980
I figured she had a gun.

07:11.990 --> 07:15.420
You thought you'd take care of the problem yourself?

07:15.430 --> 07:20.330
Even if you could reassemble a colt m1911
and fire it, what happens after you shoot him?

07:20.340 --> 07:23.120
Did you have a plan to dispose
of the body? You're not thinking.

07:23.130 --> 07:24.330
Fi.

07:24.340 --> 07:25.390
I'll make you a deal.

07:25.400 --> 07:29.520
You tell us who your mom is, and
we'll see if we can help you.

07:30.870 --> 07:32.880
All right?

07:46.360 --> 07:49.330
So, Mikey, we're doing domestic disputes now?

07:49.340 --> 07:50.170
Is that a good idea?

07:50.190 --> 07:53.470
I mean, isn't this more of
like a counselor-type thing?

07:53.510 --> 07:55.120
It sounds a little more serious.

07:55.130 --> 07:57.200
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to
be checking out this Strickler guy?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.600
You got bigger fish to fry.

07:58.610 --> 08:00.320
I told the kid I would help.

08:00.330 --> 08:01.730
You want to sit this one out, you can.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.990
No, no, no. I get it.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.710
Little kid, abusive dad.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.070
Kind of hits home.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.260
So I'll give you that one.

08:09.270 --> 08:14.490
But when the time comes to rescue a bunch of rich
women trapped in a brewery, you better step up.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.790
So she's in there with Fiona?

08:15.840 --> 08:20.300
Yeah, the idea was that she'd feel
more comfortable talking to a woman.

08:20.310 --> 08:23.030
I'm not sure if Fi counts, Mike.

08:25.350 --> 08:28.620
I appreciate the offer, but there's nothing you can do.

08:28.630 --> 08:30.520
The custody hearing's in a week.

08:30.530 --> 08:35.710
Erik's taking the son we had together, Danny,
and Joey, too, to punish me for leaving.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.220
Why do you think he'll get custody?

08:37.230 --> 08:39.070
'Cause Erik's connected.

08:39.080 --> 08:39.890
What does he do?

08:39.900 --> 08:42.110
He's a businessman.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.960
He's into politics, too... boards, commissions,
mostly around the port of Miami.

08:46.970 --> 08:49.010
That all there is to it?

08:50.070 --> 08:53.570
Well, his brother Quinn's a gangster.

08:53.580 --> 08:55.480
Smuggling mostly.

08:55.490 --> 08:58.720
The only reason Erik married me and had Danny was

08:58.730 --> 09:02.510
because Quinn wanted him to look more respectable.

09:02.520 --> 09:05.760
And then a few months after we
were married, he turned violent.

09:05.810 --> 09:07.630
Didn't you call the police?

09:07.640 --> 09:09.480
Yeah, a few times.

09:09.490 --> 09:15.870
So he... he got smarter about how he did
things, and he... stopped leaving marks.

09:15.890 --> 09:22.050
But when he started on the kids, I left, and I
have spent every dime I have fighting for custody.

09:22.060 --> 09:26.810
And... I guess Joey tried to help.

09:28.210 --> 09:31.570
I'm sorry. I... I think that... 
I think I'm wasting your time.

09:31.580 --> 09:33.660
Where can we find him?

09:34.340 --> 09:36.970
Seriously, what can you do that the police can't?

09:36.980 --> 09:39.650
You'd be surprised.

09:51.220 --> 09:53.360
So, Mikey, I asked around.

09:53.370 --> 09:55.760
Stuffed shirt over there is Erik Luna.

09:55.770 --> 09:58.450
He's on every local political board with an extra chair.

09:58.460 --> 09:59.620
He's a big deal down at the docks.

09:59.630 --> 10:01.790
I guess he even owns part of this golf club.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.560
He's a sorry excuse for a man,
but he's got a lot of friends.

10:08.980 --> 10:12.910
How about that? How about that? Nice shot, right?
That was good.

10:12.940 --> 10:16.280
The guy that worries me, though...
he's at the bar, gray suit.

10:16.290 --> 10:17.560
That's his brother, Quinn.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.940
He built this little empire.
He does all the heavy lifting.

10:19.950 --> 10:23.140
But none of it means anything without
Erik's pretty face and clean record, 

10:23.180 --> 10:25.440
so he's a little protective.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.710
The guy behind the guy.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.440
You got it.

10:32.580 --> 10:34.060
Mike, I don't know. This is a tough one.

10:34.070 --> 10:37.620
Between Erik's connections and Quinn's
muscle, these guys are damn near untouchable.

10:37.630 --> 10:40.960
We'll have to drive his happy little family apart.

10:40.970 --> 10:41.690
You up for it?

10:41.700 --> 10:42.470
Absolutely.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.360
He's smacking his wife and kids around.

10:44.370 --> 10:48.260
I'll plant a five iron in his freaking skull if it'll help.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.980
It's really okay staying with you?

10:52.020 --> 10:53.340
It's just so sudden.

10:53.350 --> 10:55.310
It's more than okay.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.610
Honest, I heard the situation, and I insisted.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.000
And don't you feel bad, all right?

10:59.010 --> 11:00.890
You're doing what's necessary for your family.

11:00.930 --> 11:02.170
Trust me, honey. I've been there.

11:02.180 --> 11:03.820
It just seems so crazy.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.710
Do you really think they can do anything?

11:07.230 --> 11:10.380
For two little boys who are being
knocked around by their father, 

11:10.390 --> 11:13.020
Michael would take on the chinese army, honey.

11:13.050 --> 11:14.210
April.

11:17.780 --> 11:19.880
Michael and Sam checked out Erik and his brother.

11:19.890 --> 11:24.300
Did he and Quinn have any issues... something
they disagreed about? Something he hid?

11:24.320 --> 11:25.850
Anything we can use to drive them apart?

11:25.860 --> 11:28.800
Well, there were things, but...

11:28.810 --> 11:31.630
April, if we're gonna solve your
problem, you need to work with us.

11:31.640 --> 11:35.420
Okay, Erik has a side business, and
when I found out, he was furious.

11:35.430 --> 11:37.440
He said he'd kill me if I told his brother.

11:37.450 --> 11:38.390
Good. We can use this.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.070
There aren't any records!

11:40.080 --> 11:41.370
If you go to the police, he's just gonna... 

11:41.380 --> 11:42.540
It's not for the police.

11:42.550 --> 11:45.650
We need to give Erik a good reason to
skip town and miss the custody hearing.

11:45.660 --> 11:47.970
But we need to keep Quinn on the sidelines.

11:47.980 --> 11:50.660
Erik will never know. Just tell me about the business.

11:51.790 --> 11:55.330
Well, I got to say, Erik Luna's got a nice little scam going.

11:55.340 --> 12:00.720
The best that I can tell, he takes stuff that gets
seized at the docks, sells it, and pockets the profits.

12:00.730 --> 12:02.230
Luxury cars, mostly.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.990
Pulls them from holding before they get
processed so there's no paper trail.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.560
And, of course, every transaction is anonymous.

12:07.570 --> 12:10.580
So if I showed up as an unsatisfied customer... 

12:10.590 --> 12:11.740
Well, he'd never know the difference.

12:11.750 --> 12:12.540
Hey, Joey.

12:12.550 --> 12:15.060
Uh, can I talk to you?

12:15.070 --> 12:15.930
Sure.

12:15.940 --> 12:20.090
Uh, Mike, I'm gonna go put
together a name and a game for you.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.470
So, what are you doing?

12:24.480 --> 12:29.000
I'm turning a cellphone into a listening
device so I can keep tabs on your stepdad.

12:29.010 --> 12:31.010
How do you learn to do this stuff?

12:31.020 --> 12:34.860
A sort of... special school.

12:34.870 --> 12:36.700
Hard to explain.

12:37.810 --> 12:39.870
You want to give me a hand?

12:40.940 --> 12:44.230
You see that... see that wire?

12:44.240 --> 12:49.270
I want you to take these and hold it right there.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.040
All righty.

12:52.070 --> 12:55.680
I... I think my mom is starting to get her hopes up.

12:55.690 --> 12:58.440
Don't worry. We're not gonna let her down.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.760
So you really think you can make this guy run?

13:01.770 --> 13:03.660
I know I can.

13:04.190 --> 13:06.730
It's gonna be my pleasure.

13:13.280 --> 13:17.720
When you're undercover, you
often fight your emotions.

13:20.150 --> 13:23.280
If the operation demands that
you be a target's best friend, 

13:23.290 --> 13:26.170
you do it, no matter what you're feeling.

13:28.190 --> 13:29.380
Excuse me, sir.

13:29.390 --> 13:35.120
But there are times emotions can help sell a cover I.D.

13:35.130 --> 13:38.070
If hitting a guy reinforces your cover...

13:38.080 --> 13:38.600
Can I help you?

13:38.610 --> 13:40.410
You give it all you got.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.590
Erik Luna, you are a hard man to find. You know that?

13:43.600 --> 13:44.380
Who the hell are you?!

13:44.390 --> 13:48.150
I bought a car from you... a
car which nearly got me killed.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.680
Is everything okay, Mr. Luna?

13:49.690 --> 13:50.940
Yes. I'm fine.

13:50.950 --> 13:52.720
You want to try knocking next time?

13:52.730 --> 13:55.110
J... just close the door.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.560
What are you talking about? Who are you?

13:56.570 --> 13:59.740
The name's Peter. I bought
a lot us from you a while back.

13:59.750 --> 14:05.180
One day, it disappears, replaced by a note
which informed me that I'm a dead man.

14:05.190 --> 14:07.680
I go home. My house is torched.

14:07.690 --> 14:10.470
Next day, I'm nearly killed in a drive-by.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.620
All of which made me curious to know
where the hell did you get that car from!

14:14.630 --> 14:16.000
That was an anonymous sale.

14:16.010 --> 14:17.270
You're not even supposed to be here.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.120
Let's just say I was motivated to find you.

14:20.130 --> 14:21.620
That was a mistake.

14:21.630 --> 14:23.480
You need to leave.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.380
I'm trying to stay a step ahead of a death squad.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.700
I need my money back.

14:30.710 --> 14:33.470
Even if I wanted to give you that money, you
think I carry that kind of cash around?

14:33.500 --> 14:38.310
Didn't anyone ever tell you the customer is always right?!

14:43.950 --> 14:45.200
You've got one day.

14:45.210 --> 14:51.370
You'd better watch out, because if they're
after me, you can be damn sure they're after you.

14:57.150 --> 14:59.270
I got a call from Erik this morning.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.270
He was yelling.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.180
It's natural for him to be upset.

15:02.220 --> 15:04.540
He has a problem. For once, he can't run to his big brother.

15:04.550 --> 15:07.350
Do you really think he's gonna leave
town before the custody hearing?

15:07.360 --> 15:10.400
Oh, he will, 'cause if he doesn't, I'm
gonna take a claw hammer to his... 

15:10.410 --> 15:13.140
Um, yes. I think he'll leave.

15:13.150 --> 15:17.330
It's just that on the phone, he... 
he sounded more angry than scared.

15:17.340 --> 15:19.510
Well, that's about to change.

15:22.570 --> 15:27.240
99% of controlling someone's behavior
is controlling their environment.

15:27.250 --> 15:34.190
All the conversations in the world won't have the same
impact as turning off the right light at the right time.

15:35.400 --> 15:40.740
If you want to kill a streetlight without the mess and
inconvenience of breaking into the pole with a cutting torch, 

15:40.750 --> 15:43.990
you need to access the circuit breaker.

15:44.830 --> 15:48.420
Connect lines from the breakers
to an exposed cellphone wire, 

15:48.430 --> 15:52.530
and with a quick call, you can short the circuits.

15:54.050 --> 15:57.960
A similar trick can be used
to temporarily disable a car.

15:57.970 --> 16:04.610
It doesn't take much to trip a few electronic safety
mechanisms and make a vehicle impossible to start.

16:04.620 --> 16:07.760
If you want to make sure you're the only one making calls, 

16:07.820 --> 16:12.980
a $100 cellphone jammer will block
all signals in a one-block radius.

16:13.010 --> 16:17.210
You have no idea how painful it was to be
under that car and not wire it to explode.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.950
If Erik's car blows up a week before his custody
hearing, they'll be a lot of eyes on April.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.340
We need him running, not bleeding.

16:22.350 --> 16:25.290
Well, technically, you can run and bleed.

16:25.700 --> 16:29.940
Hey, gang. We got firearms, and we got snacks.

16:35.550 --> 16:39.550
When you want to create fear, it's best to keep it simple.

16:39.560 --> 16:43.210
The same things people are afraid of as kids...

16:43.370 --> 16:46.540
scare them when they're adults.

16:48.900 --> 16:52.050
Fear of the dark, for example.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.109
Fear of being alone.

17:11.440 --> 17:15.260
And above all, fear of the unknown.

17:40.610 --> 17:42.870
I'll go collect the toys.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.450
Yeah. This is Pete.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.610
It's Erik Luna.

17:46.670 --> 17:47.710
We need to talk.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.800
Damn right we do.

17:59.290 --> 18:04.150
No, no, no, no, no. That bitch can get the kids one
weekend a month a... and one holiday a year.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.100
That's it! I don't c... 

18:07.160 --> 18:09.010
You're the lawyer. Just figure it out.

18:09.060 --> 18:11.300
If she doesn't sign, she'll never see those brats.

18:11.340 --> 18:15.960
I got enough stuff to deal with. Just do
the paperwork and force it down her throat.

18:16.350 --> 18:17.390
Do you have my money?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.310
No. I, uh... 

18:18.320 --> 18:19.930
What did I say? Was I unclear?

18:19.940 --> 18:22.090
Hey, whoever tried to kill you came after me, too.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.880
Didn't I tell you? Now, stop playing games.

18:23.890 --> 18:25.840
I need my money to get out of town.

18:25.850 --> 18:30.560
Look, Pete, I can't give you the
money, but I am gonna help you.

18:30.570 --> 18:31.580
We're gonna help each other.

18:31.590 --> 18:32.860
We're gonna find out who did this.

18:32.870 --> 18:35.280
Are you crazy? Find him how?

18:35.290 --> 18:38.130
We take what you know, we put it with
what I know, and we track him down!

18:38.140 --> 18:39.800
There is no "we."

18:39.810 --> 18:43.150
You want to stay, you want
to die, fine. I'm out of here.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.920
Wait, wait, no! You can't go anywhere.

18:44.930 --> 18:46.720
Look, I had no problem till you showed up.

18:46.730 --> 18:51.890
I showed up because you sold me a
car that belonged to a psychopath!

18:51.900 --> 18:53.280
That's my point, okay?

18:53.290 --> 18:54.920
We are in this together.

18:54.930 --> 18:56.240
We'll fix this together!

18:56.250 --> 18:59.060
We will fix this when we disappear.

18:59.070 --> 19:00.770
We're not running.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.830
No, I... I got stuff to answer to here. I got a life here.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.170
You'll get your money when we figure out the problem.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.970
Hey, Mikey, how'd it go?

19:11.980 --> 19:14.090
He's scared, but not ready to run yet.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.650
He wants to team up, see who's after him.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.940
Well, I guess we're gonna have
to make him regret that decision.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.250
Yeah. We'll let him stew for the night.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.990
I want to see what Diego's doing with the name "Tom Strickler."

19:23.000 --> 19:26.970
Oh, yeah, listen. By the way, I got ahold of
my buddy who works for the phone company.

19:26.980 --> 19:31.100
He's gonna pull his cherry picker in front
of the hangar and take a 2-hour lunch.

19:31.110 --> 19:32.880
That's all I need.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.770
And that's all I need.

19:42.980 --> 19:49.090
With today's powerful encryption, it's usually a
waste of time trying to decipher coded communication.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.930
Tap the data stream of even a low-level spy, 

19:51.940 --> 19:55.700
and you're just going to get incomprehensible garbage.

19:57.460 --> 20:01.870
Just because it's garbage doesn't
mean it's worthless, though.

20:07.190 --> 20:14.080
A network analyzer can tell you how much information
someone's accessing and how encoded it is.

20:14.090 --> 20:18.440
If someone starts using heavy-duty crypto
and changing their security protocol, 

20:18.450 --> 20:20.580
you know you've touched a nerve.

20:20.590 --> 20:24.890
And sometimes, that's enough to
tell you what you need to know.

20:28.930 --> 20:30.710
Yeah. Pete? It's Erik.

20:30.720 --> 20:33.030
They're here. They're outside my office.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.700
What are you talking about? Who's there?

20:34.710 --> 20:38.470
I saw some blue car drive by the club like three times.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.090
I think it's the people that took a shot at me.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.660
Blue car? What kind?

20:42.670 --> 20:45.140
I don't know. Like a... like a
Plymouth or Chevy or something.

20:45.150 --> 20:46.660
You stay inside. You stay there.

20:46.670 --> 20:48.950
You don't move until I get there.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.740
Michael, I was just gonna call you.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.430
Erik attacked April at work.

20:55.440 --> 20:56.620
Mom, where's Joey?

20:56.630 --> 20:59.550
Joey? Uh, he went out back.
He's very upset, Michael.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.490
Look out into the garage. Did he take your car?

21:01.500 --> 21:03.800
I need to know right now.

21:04.820 --> 21:06.710
It's gone.

21:07.230 --> 21:09.320
What, you think Joey took the car?

21:09.330 --> 21:11.540
Let's hope that's all he took.

21:37.990 --> 21:40.030
Put it down. Put it down.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.850
Stop right there and back up. Back up!

21:42.860 --> 21:43.830
This is a mistake.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.510
The mistake was letting you help, okay?

21:45.520 --> 21:47.300
You only made it worse.

21:47.770 --> 21:50.450
Erik went after your mother because he's scared.

21:50.460 --> 21:53.110
What we're doing is working. You just
need to give it a little more time.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.710
Look, we don't have time.

21:56.090 --> 21:57.040
Joey...

21:57.090 --> 22:02.390
before my dad died, he made me promise that I would
protect my mother, and I'm not gonna let him down.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.520
This is not what he meant.

22:03.530 --> 22:04.740
You didn't know my father!

22:04.750 --> 22:06.530
No, but I know that shotgun.

22:06.540 --> 22:08.500
You know it's just loaded with bird shot?

22:08.510 --> 22:10.300
It's got a range of about 14 feet.

22:10.310 --> 22:13.770
The only damage you're gonna do to
Erik from here... make his ears hurt.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.330
And you see that plug right there?

22:15.340 --> 22:18.670
That means it can only get off two shots at a time.

22:18.720 --> 22:19.650
Let go!

22:19.710 --> 22:22.860
You see your mom hurt, and you want to help. I get it.

22:22.870 --> 22:26.950
Joey, but not like this.

22:26.960 --> 22:27.930
Listen to me.

22:27.940 --> 22:32.550
Right now, Erik Luna is sitting in
that parking lot, about to wet himself.

22:32.560 --> 22:36.360
Do you want to help me put him over the edge?

22:36.370 --> 22:39.470
Get back in my mom's car and drive
out of here as fast as you can.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.400
Burn some rubber. Make some noise.

22:41.410 --> 22:43.720
And then I want you to meet me over on 5th street.

22:43.730 --> 22:44.590
Can you do that?

22:44.600 --> 22:45.880
Yeah.

22:45.890 --> 22:47.880
Hey, don't get caught, all right?

22:47.890 --> 22:50.060
I don't want to have to explain
why I let a 13-year-old drive a car.

22:50.070 --> 22:51.410
Now go.

23:10.270 --> 23:12.480
Did you see it?! It just came... 

23:13.070 --> 23:14.260
God!

23:14.270 --> 23:16.820
You idiot, running around here with that hand cannon.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.660
You scared him off. That was our one chance.

23:18.670 --> 23:20.060
I can't take this anymore.

23:20.070 --> 23:20.920
It's too much.

23:20.930 --> 23:21.790
I'm with you.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.570
Let's get out of town until it blows over.

23:23.580 --> 23:24.190
That's not an option.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.260
That is the only option!

23:25.270 --> 23:27.040
No! I'll get us some help.

23:27.050 --> 23:28.600
What, you're gonna go to your brother?

23:28.610 --> 23:31.650
No. What are you, crazy? I'm not
asking him. He is not getting involved.

23:31.690 --> 23:32.820
I'll... I'll ask around.

23:32.860 --> 23:37.200
What, are you gonna ask some knucklehead
off the street to fix this? No.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.220
If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right.

23:40.230 --> 23:42.050
I know some people.

23:43.110 --> 23:45.020
Oh, man! That's Quinn's car.

23:45.070 --> 23:47.070
Uh, I got to go.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.300
I don't care the cost.

23:48.330 --> 23:50.240
Make the call.

24:11.750 --> 24:12.810
You okay?

24:12.820 --> 24:14.150
Yeah. I'm fine.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.010
Look, I'm sorry. I... I just got... 

24:16.020 --> 24:18.050
We'll talk about it later.

24:19.010 --> 24:20.100
Wait. Who are you calling?

24:20.110 --> 24:22.010
Remember that bug that you helped me make?

24:22.020 --> 24:23.500
Well, now we're gonna do some listening.

24:23.510 --> 24:25.030
Quinn, l... let me just explain.

24:25.040 --> 24:29.850
Councilman Ryan's wife saw you run
through the parking lot with a gun!

24:29.860 --> 24:34.250
This guy is itching for any excuse to back out
of our deal, and you do something so stupid... 

24:34.260 --> 24:35.720
Let me just tell you what really happened.

24:35.730 --> 24:37.540
I was taking the gun to my car.

24:37.550 --> 24:38.990
It slipped, okay?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.540
I... I picked it up.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.320
Are you using again?

24:43.360 --> 24:46.850
What? No. God, no!

24:47.800 --> 24:49.040
We had a good thing going here.

24:49.050 --> 24:50.680
Yeah.

24:51.340 --> 24:56.190
I don't mind doing the dirty work while
you golf with your fancy little friends, 

24:56.200 --> 24:58.210
as long as you keep your nose clean.

24:58.220 --> 24:59.960
You fall apart, Erik, and I swear to God... 

24:59.970 --> 25:04.220
No, Quinn, just... I swear I'm fine.

25:05.450 --> 25:07.370
Really?

25:07.980 --> 25:10.310
You better be.

25:10.350 --> 25:12.380
'Cause if you're not...

25:15.170 --> 25:17.980
Get yourself cleaned up.

25:18.060 --> 25:20.060
Get the door.

25:20.930 --> 25:25.290
And, Erik, no more episodes.

25:30.710 --> 25:32.990
That's awesome! He's totally freaking out.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.640
I told you it was gonna work.

25:34.650 --> 25:39.300
But you got to promise me from now on you
will stay at my mom's until we're done.

25:39.310 --> 25:42.040
I... I promise.

25:48.250 --> 25:51.080
When you push someone to the point of desperation, 

25:51.090 --> 25:56.890
there's always a chance they'll go looking
for help, which could be a problem...

25:56.900 --> 26:00.360
unless you're the one providing the help.

26:11.540 --> 26:13.260
Mr. Carson.

26:13.270 --> 26:15.060
And you are, uh, Mr. Luna?

26:15.070 --> 26:17.080
Yeah. Who are you?

26:17.090 --> 26:18.910
Peace of mind, Mr. Luna.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.020
That's what you're looking for, isn't it?

26:20.060 --> 26:21.770
We need this done as quick as possible.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.190
So you think you can find this guy?

26:23.200 --> 26:23.930
I'm sure we can.

26:23.970 --> 26:27.100
Mr. Carson filled us in on everything,
including yesterday's incident.

26:27.110 --> 26:28.240
Nothing we can't handle.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.290
So, uh, how much are we talking?

26:30.300 --> 26:32.060
$40, 000 to start, $40, 000 to finish.

26:32.070 --> 26:33.490
But th... that's crazy.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.590
$50, 000 total. Th... that's as high as I go.

26:37.420 --> 26:39.570
Sweet dreams, gentlemen.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.860
Wait, wait! Fine.

26:56.970 --> 26:58.950
I want to be there when you take him out.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.180
I want to see his face.

27:00.190 --> 27:01.630
Naturally.

27:01.640 --> 27:04.150
We'll be in touch when we find him.

27:14.430 --> 27:15.720
You're negotiating?!

27:15.730 --> 27:17.400
What, do you think you're buying a used car?!

27:17.410 --> 27:18.910
They walked away, what were you gonna do?

27:18.920 --> 27:23.440
This doesn't work, we got two options... run or die.

27:30.340 --> 27:32.920
Oh, man, I thought that guy was gonna blow the deal there.

27:32.930 --> 27:35.120
I was walking back to the car as slow as I could.

27:35.130 --> 27:35.910
It worked.

27:35.920 --> 27:39.510
I made it clear if the expert assassins
fail that he'd better head for the Hills.

27:39.520 --> 27:40.720
And fail we will.

27:40.730 --> 27:42.980
And I got a perfect spot for it down in Hallendale.

27:42.990 --> 27:47.130
Buddy of mine was a navy chaplain, and
he started a homeless outreach program.

27:47.140 --> 27:49.720
But he's in Guatemala now, so
we got the place free and clear.

27:49.780 --> 27:50.660
Then let's finish this.

27:50.670 --> 27:54.450
The sooner April and her boys don't
have to worry about Luna, the better.

27:58.930 --> 28:02.460
If you want the appearance of a
gunshot without actually dying, 

28:02.470 --> 28:06.370
you need to create a high-powered burst of blood.

28:09.560 --> 28:15.270
A bottle cap packed with a bit of
plastic explosive does the trick nicely.

28:24.330 --> 28:28.120
Rig a few remote charges to
create the sound of a firearm, 

28:28.130 --> 28:30.490
and you've got everything you need.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.860
Looks like we're good to go.

28:38.010 --> 28:39.170
Yes, Mr. Luna.

28:39.180 --> 28:42.640
I believe we've found the person
that's been trying to kill you.

28:50.940 --> 28:51.510
Morning.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.950
So, where is he?

28:52.960 --> 28:53.980
He's in there.

28:53.990 --> 28:55.940
We scouted last night.

28:55.950 --> 28:58.520
Looks like we got your shooter, plus two support guys.

28:58.530 --> 28:59.860
H... how'd you find him so fast?

28:59.870 --> 29:03.350
The car you sold to Mr. Carson could only
have come from two factories in Italy.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.000
That led us to the name of the original buyer.

29:05.010 --> 29:08.260
Some guy named Chuck Finley, if
that means anything to you.

29:08.270 --> 29:11.600
The blue car you saw... stolen from
this neighborhood a few days back.

29:11.610 --> 29:15.860
And that place was rented a week
ago in cash by Mr. Chuck Finley.

29:15.870 --> 29:17.590
I told you these guys were good.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.400
So we will hit them around the back, through the alley.

29:20.410 --> 29:21.830
Easy-peasy.

29:26.400 --> 29:30.320
Getting a target to do what you
want requires a delicate touch.

29:30.330 --> 29:34.330
Sometimes you're a bully, and
sometimes you're a friend.

29:34.420 --> 29:36.540
You two wait here.

29:38.170 --> 29:40.480
You come in after to confirm the kill.

29:40.490 --> 29:43.230
We'll all be at the beach before noon.

29:44.270 --> 29:46.350
Don't look so nervous, boys.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.790
They're sitting ducks in there.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.940
It'll be over in seconds.

29:52.210 --> 29:56.490
You have to know when to give
the target help and comfort...

29:57.590 --> 30:00.210
and when to take it away.

30:05.330 --> 30:06.770
Get back.

30:09.310 --> 30:10.520
Where are they?

30:10.530 --> 30:12.470
Where are they?!

30:23.760 --> 30:25.570
Run!

30:58.780 --> 30:59.980
Nice fall, Shakespeare.

30:59.990 --> 31:03.070
Oh, you should talk. You look like
you got shot by a bow and arrow.

31:03.080 --> 31:03.960
You don't know what you're talking about!

31:03.970 --> 31:05.340
A 9-mil at this range?

31:05.370 --> 31:10.620
Guys, guys, guys, the point is, I'm pretty sure Erik is
planning on missing his next custody hearing.

31:10.630 --> 31:13.180
Let's clean up and get out of here.

31:18.930 --> 31:22.420
When you work as a spy, follow-through is crucial.

31:22.430 --> 31:25.040
Even the best-executed plan can fall apart.

31:25.050 --> 31:25.870
God damn it! Zip!

31:25.880 --> 31:29.520
You don't score if you spike the
ball before you're in the end zone.

31:29.560 --> 31:30.630
Quinn.
What are you doing?

31:30.680 --> 31:32.740
I have to go. Somebody's trying to
kill me. I have to get out of town.

31:32.780 --> 31:34.300
What? Who?

31:34.310 --> 31:36.930
I don't know. I don't know. I've never
seen him! I can't stop him! I... I... 

31:36.970 --> 31:39.470
What are you talking about?!
You're not leaving town!

31:39.480 --> 31:40.440
You don't understand.

31:40.450 --> 31:42.070
I understand you're acting like a lunatic.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.640
What makes you think that
somebody's trying to kill you?

31:43.650 --> 31:45.370
I don't think! I know!

31:45.380 --> 31:48.300
Hey, hey, our business depends on you.

31:48.310 --> 31:49.840
You don't get to leave town.

31:49.850 --> 31:52.020
But I saw three people killed this morning!
Three people? Where?

31:52.030 --> 31:53.800
Down i... in Hallendale.

31:53.810 --> 31:55.120
Listen to me!

31:55.130 --> 31:56.400
Now, you pull it together.

31:56.410 --> 32:01.170
I'm gonna get my guys down here, and we're gonna
find out what the hell you are talking about.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.610
All right?!

32:02.620 --> 32:04.220
Okay.

32:06.550 --> 32:07.260
What's up, Sam?

32:07.270 --> 32:09.910
We got a problem. Quinn got to Erik before he could run.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.650
They're headed back to Hallendale.

32:11.660 --> 32:12.870
Not good.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.470
I know. We got to do something now.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.750
Hang on, Fi.

32:27.700 --> 32:28.970
How much time do we have?

32:28.980 --> 32:30.600
Well, with drive time, about a half an hour.

32:30.610 --> 32:32.210
Why? What are you thinking? You got an idea?

32:32.220 --> 32:33.930
Remember Moscow,  '99?

32:33.940 --> 32:36.220
Colonel Prokov... the one with the drinking problem?

32:36.230 --> 32:38.150
Wait. You want to pull that here?

32:38.160 --> 32:40.760
Mike, that took, like, weeks of
prep, to do that in a half an hour... 

32:40.800 --> 32:42.580
Not much choice, Sam.

32:42.590 --> 32:45.820
When a plan goes wrong, you have two basic options.

32:45.830 --> 32:49.010
The first is to accept failure and abort the mission.

32:49.020 --> 32:54.160
That works best when you have the resources
and time to remove personnel from the field.

32:54.170 --> 32:58.380
When you don't have resources and
time, you're left with option two.

32:58.480 --> 33:03.200
Get back in there and salvage
the situation any way you can.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.890
I'm all for a gunfight, Michael, but this could be suicide.

33:05.900 --> 33:06.960
She's right, mike.

33:06.990 --> 33:10.530
If it doesn't work, you're gonna be here
alone with Quinn's guys and all their guns.

33:10.540 --> 33:12.710
Guess it'll have to work, then.

33:18.380 --> 33:24.780
There's a long tradition in spycraft of
making enemy assets appear unreliable.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.380
Make a loyal operative look like a traitor, 

33:27.390 --> 33:31.880
for example, and if you're lucky, your
enemies take him out for you.

33:34.740 --> 33:39.890
Better than making an enemy look
disloyal is making him look insane.

33:44.180 --> 33:50.220
It takes some doing, but when you pull it
off, it's more devastating than a bullet.

33:54.780 --> 33:58.980
Sir how much for that apron and hat?

33:59.020 --> 34:02.760
And the cross, too.

34:09.159 --> 34:11.440
They were right there.

34:13.370 --> 34:14.480
There's nothing here, Quinn.

34:14.489 --> 34:17.810
No blood, no shells, nothing.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.320
You're sure this is the spot?

34:23.330 --> 34:24.830
They must have moved the bodies.

34:24.840 --> 34:26.080
Oh, moved the bodies and cleaned up the blood?

34:26.090 --> 34:28.460
It's like... it's like before the drive-by.
Drive-by?

34:28.469 --> 34:31.320
Yeah, at the club. They... they
turned off all... all the lights, 

34:31.360 --> 34:33.380
and then my phone wouldn't
work, the car doesn't start.

34:33.409 --> 34:34.889
Then everything goes right back on!

34:34.929 --> 34:37.380
I... I wanted to tell you, Quinn, but I couldn't.

34:37.389 --> 34:39.460
You got to believe me!

34:39.469 --> 34:41.270
Well, you're making it real hard, Erik.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.130
They're here! They're here!

34:42.139 --> 34:44.480
They're... they're right up the block.

34:47.659 --> 34:49.280
Show me.

34:51.159 --> 34:53.929
They're... right there

34:55.190 --> 34:56.659
Yeah, we, uh... we shouldn't.

34:56.670 --> 34:58.600
W... what if they're in there?

34:58.610 --> 35:03.160
If they're in there, we'll be fine.

35:07.620 --> 35:09.590
May I help you?

35:10.370 --> 35:11.670
You?

35:11.680 --> 35:13.940
I... I saw... I saw you die.

35:13.950 --> 35:14.850
Oh, no.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.670
Erik, has it gotten worse?

35:16.680 --> 35:18.990
Wait. You know my brother?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.060
You must be Quinn. He's talked about you.

35:21.070 --> 35:23.670
I'm Father Peter. Our Lady of Grace charities.

35:23.680 --> 35:28.150
N... no! Quinn, t... that's not... that's Pete! He's one of them!

35:28.160 --> 35:29.540
I saw him killed!

35:29.550 --> 35:30.950
I do outreach for the homeless.

35:30.960 --> 35:34.400
I saw Erik on the street one night in a... in a daze.

35:34.410 --> 35:35.260
I tried to help him.

35:35.270 --> 35:36.390
No! He's lying! Quinn... 

35:36.400 --> 35:38.550
I said shut your mouth!

35:38.560 --> 35:40.100
Don't be too hard on him.

35:40.110 --> 35:41.980
Has he been talking about the killers?

35:41.990 --> 35:43.930
You... you said there were killers.

35:43.940 --> 35:51.130
He sees assassins everywhere, and now he claims to
be hiring killers of his own to go after the other killers.

35:51.160 --> 35:52.380
I've tried to help him.

35:52.410 --> 35:53.300
You're a liar!

35:53.310 --> 35:54.100
Get off!

35:54.130 --> 35:56.410
It's all right, Erik. Your mind is sick.

35:56.450 --> 35:57.270
I know your pain.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.420
You're gonna get me killed!

35:58.430 --> 36:00.300
Enough! Get off! Get him out!

36:00.310 --> 36:01.300
You're gonna get me killed.

36:01.310 --> 36:03.750
Outside. Outside!

36:06.110 --> 36:07.730
It's not Erik's fault.

36:07.740 --> 36:09.240
He needs help and care.

36:09.250 --> 36:12.140
H... he's lying to you, Quinn! Come on!
Enough!

36:12.200 --> 36:13.180
You got to believe me!

36:13.220 --> 36:14.830
I'm not!

36:16.030 --> 36:17.620
It's him!

36:17.630 --> 36:19.220
He's one of the killers, too!

36:19.230 --> 36:21.080
Yeah, they're in this together!

36:21.090 --> 36:22.310
He sells pineapple, Erik.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.200
She's one of them, too!

36:23.250 --> 36:24.860
Look! She's one of them!

36:24.870 --> 36:26.630
Please, come on! Just tell them!

36:26.640 --> 36:28.510
Please. Tell them, please.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.940
Get up.
No!

36:29.980 --> 36:31.460
Get him in the car now! Now!

36:31.470 --> 36:33.380
I don't want to go in the car, no.

36:35.770 --> 36:38.070
I am so sorry.

36:38.080 --> 36:41.500
He's lucky to have you for a brother.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.560
He... he just winked!
Inside!

36:51.590 --> 36:53.590
You're not a priest!

37:02.320 --> 37:03.430
It's official.

37:03.440 --> 37:08.710
With Erik locked up in a mental facility, the
judge had to give me full custody.

37:08.720 --> 37:12.670
We're gonna stay with my cousin for a
few months until we can get back on track.

37:12.680 --> 37:13.790
Well, this might help.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.740
It was Erik's.

37:14.750 --> 37:17.170
$40, 000.

37:17.510 --> 37:20.980
I... I don't know how to thank you.

37:22.100 --> 37:24.740
You saved our lives.

37:31.180 --> 37:32.850
You gonna be all right?

37:32.860 --> 37:34.660
I... I don't know. I guess.

37:34.670 --> 37:38.450
Think my mom thinks I'm some sort of delinquent.

37:38.980 --> 37:41.450
I knew a kid once who had it rough growing up.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.340
Almost as bad as you.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.590
And what happened to him?

37:47.600 --> 37:53.480
He got a job doing a lot of the same stuff
that got him into trouble when he was a kid.

37:53.490 --> 37:57.330
He, uh... he turned out all right.

37:57.340 --> 38:00.050
So you're saying I should eat a lot of yogurt?

38:00.060 --> 38:01.970
Can't hurt.

38:16.150 --> 38:19.980
Well, it sounds like losing Erik put
a big dent in Quinn Luna's business.

38:19.990 --> 38:22.020
The cops are looking into him.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.360
Better than he deserves.

38:25.810 --> 38:27.940
Mike, you've been quiet all day.

38:27.950 --> 38:31.120
Want a beer? Mike, beer?

38:31.140 --> 38:33.950
Come on. It's low-calorie, if that makes a difference.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.470
What? I'm watching my weight.

38:35.500 --> 38:38.600
I should go. I need to follow
upon that Strickler business.

38:38.610 --> 38:39.720
You want some company?

38:39.730 --> 38:41.820
No. It's just this in-and-out thing.

38:41.830 --> 38:43.730
I'll be fine.

38:46.390 --> 38:47.170
Have fun.

38:47.180 --> 38:49.940
Looks like you won't be needing this.

38:57.830 --> 38:59.150
Put it down.

38:59.180 --> 39:04.000
You know, Michael, spying on a government employee
with top-secret clearance is a serious crime.

39:04.010 --> 39:06.570
If asking nicely worked, I wouldn't have to.

39:06.580 --> 39:09.910
So, find out anything about Strickler?

39:09.920 --> 39:10.780
Care to share?

39:10.790 --> 39:12.060
Thanks to you dropping that name, 

39:12.070 --> 39:18.500
I spent the last four days dealing with reporting
procedures for six different U.S. Intelligence outfits, 

39:18.510 --> 39:20.390
including one I didn't know existed.

39:20.400 --> 39:24.050
That's in between the calls, e-mails, meetings.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.420
Find out anything good?

39:25.470 --> 39:31.180
One more question, and you go from being the
burned spy I hate to the anonymous burglar I shot.

39:31.190 --> 39:34.160
I've got a career to think about here.

39:38.690 --> 39:42.520
I just needed to know how connected Strickler is.

39:42.530 --> 39:45.790
I'm pretty sure you just answered my question.

39:54.830 --> 39:56.500
You know your champagnes, Michael?

39:56.510 --> 39:57.980
Bollinger blanc de noirs.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.360
It's my "new friend" champagne.

39:59.370 --> 40:01.920
Don't pop the cork just yet.

40:03.100 --> 40:06.510
Okay, well, we both know you checked my references, 

40:06.520 --> 40:09.400
and we both know that I have the access you need.

40:09.410 --> 40:13.390
Really, the only question is whether we can
figure out a mutually beneficial relationship.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.040
I help you, you help me.

40:15.050 --> 40:17.580
So what do you say we make
this a take-it-or-leave-it moment?

40:17.590 --> 40:19.480
I'm not sure what I'd be taking.

40:19.490 --> 40:20.910
A job, for starters.

40:20.920 --> 40:21.790
You're perfect for it.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.060
Say yes, and I start the ball rolling today, 

40:24.070 --> 40:26.560
and you're on your way back to
being a respectable citizen again.

40:26.570 --> 40:29.640
Say no, you'll never hear from me again.

40:29.650 --> 40:31.510
What's the job?

40:31.520 --> 40:35.150
I can't give you the details just yet, but
it won't offend your sensibilities.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.420
Trust me.

40:37.670 --> 40:40.180
So, in or out?

40:40.890 --> 40:45.460
As a spy, you often have to do things you
don't like for people you don't trust.

40:45.470 --> 40:49.100
You don't always get to choose who you do business with.

40:49.110 --> 40:54.420
When the devil himself is
offering the thing you want most, 

40:54.430 --> 40:56.780
sometimes you dance with the devil.

40:56.830 --> 40:58.990
I'm in.
