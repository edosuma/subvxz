01:16.360 --> 01:18.078
Hey, Mom.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.791
Oh, Kelly, something horrible
has happened.

01:25.040 --> 01:28.032
Okay, don't worry, Mom.
I'm gonna call 911.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.516
Oh, my God, I forgot the number.
Oh, God!

01:32.720 --> 01:34.358
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.192
Oh, Kelly, it's okay.

01:36.440 --> 01:39.716
It's just that none
of my shows are on. Look.

01:39.960 --> 01:43.669
<i>I turn to Oprah,
and I get Monster Truckin'.</i>

01:43.920 --> 01:48.311
<i>I turn to Phil,
and it's midget wrestling.</i>

01:48.560 --> 01:53.475
<i>And look, I turn to Richard Bey
and it's a wet T-shirt contest.</i>

01:54.520 --> 01:58.718
<i>Oh, wait a second.
That is Richard Bey.</i>

01:59.520 --> 02:01.397
Who could have done this to me?

02:16.560 --> 02:18.118
Hi, Peg.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.471
<i>How was Oprah?</i>

02:22.720 --> 02:24.950
<i>Oprah wasn't on today, Al.</i>

02:27.600 --> 02:30.512
And she won't be on tomorrow
either, Peg.

02:30.760 --> 02:35.834
Why? Because I had
the cable company take her off. See?

02:36.800 --> 02:39.314
The "Guy Package"?

02:40.120 --> 02:42.429
With femme block.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.070
See, it's a new service
they offer men...

02:47.320 --> 02:50.073
...and some female tennis players...

02:51.480 --> 02:53.869
...who are tired of watching
girlie crap.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.997
See, Peg, it's my week off...

02:56.240 --> 02:58.629
...and I want to spend it
watching quality TV.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.317
<i>You mean like monster movies,
jiggly shows and The Three Stooges?</i>

03:03.560 --> 03:05.516
Certainly.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.310
<i>And now, the exciting conclusion...</i>

03:09.520 --> 03:14.594
<i>...of the Centerfold Weed-Whacker
Murders, on The Guy Channel.</i>

03:15.520 --> 03:18.114
That's it. I'm going over to Marcie's.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.635
Tell her I said:

03:23.640 --> 03:26.108
God, Daddy, you can really be
insensitive sometimes.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.392
I know. Keep it down, pumpkin.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.995
This is where the camp
counselor sprains her knee...

03:32.240 --> 03:33.832
...running away
from the lizard king.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.640
She doesn't have any bandages
so she has to cut strips...

03:36.840 --> 03:39.832
...from her already too short skirt.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.991
Now, this is the part
I gotta ask you to leave, pumpkin.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.956
- Guy package, Dad?
- With femme block, son.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.591
Kelly, guess what?

04:02.840 --> 04:05.798
I've been chosen to be in a research
study about human behavior.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.914
So where do you fit in?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.953
Well, unlike you,
in the front seat of a car.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.828
That's another story.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.149
The point is, they're paying me
300 bucks...

04:17.360 --> 04:20.750
...which should earn me first-class
passage on the old Amber airlines.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.555
Yeah, like she's really knocking
down the door...

04:23.760 --> 04:27.833
...to see you again after your little
movie-theater-popcorn trick.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.716
Hi, Bud.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.950
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi, Amber, what's up?

04:35.200 --> 04:36.679
<i>Your mom needs her TV Guide.</i>

04:36.920 --> 04:39.673
She says it's in the room
of broken promises.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.480
That would be in her bedroom. Okay.

04:45.320 --> 04:48.118
Amber, my sweet.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.673
It has come to my attention...

04:50.880 --> 04:53.952
...that I may have been
a bit forward with you in the past.

04:54.320 --> 04:58.199
You mean like when you grabbed
my shirt and went:

05:00.320 --> 05:01.548
Yeah.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.270
And I was thinking that maybe
I could make it up to you this weekend.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.476
Your pants or mine?

05:08.840 --> 05:12.116
You're amazing. Where do you learn
this kind of behavior?

05:12.360 --> 05:15.318
No, you can't hide under
the tree stump.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.480
He can burrow.

05:18.680 --> 05:22.559
Don't you see? He's half mole!

05:25.760 --> 05:28.672
Well, anyway.
For your information...

05:28.880 --> 05:31.553
...a woman is more than a loose
assortment of body parts...

05:31.760 --> 05:33.512
...put here for your entertainment.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.159
We have minds too.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.114
Hey, guys. This is so funny.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.470
What a great idea. Look.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.998
<i>Beverly Hills, 90,210.</i>

05:47.040 --> 05:48.632
Boy, they must be really dumb.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.912
That far in the future
they're still in high school.

05:53.640 --> 05:57.952
Look, Amber. I do respect your mind.

05:58.200 --> 06:01.954
I'd just respect it even more if it would
bounce gently when you walk.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.032
Smooth.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.840
Kelly, what am I missing?

06:09.080 --> 06:12.152
Well, why don't we make this quicker
and talk about what you've got.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.154
- Okay. Well, then, what have I got?
- Nothing. See how quick that was?

06:18.120 --> 06:20.554
Oh, God.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.714
Save me, Al.

06:26.960 --> 06:31.192
I walk in the door after a hard day
of billiards and what do I see?

06:31.440 --> 06:34.557
<i>Peggy and Marcie sitting on the couch
watching, on Oprah...</i>

06:34.760 --> 06:36.671
..."Women Who Support Men."

06:36.920 --> 06:40.230
Where do they find these losers?

06:40.640 --> 06:43.916
- You got anything to eat?
- Check the traps.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.714
Hey, Al, you know,
I've always been meaning to ask you...

06:48.960 --> 06:50.279
...what does this switch do?

06:50.520 --> 06:52.909
I don't know.
Get over here and sit down.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.077
- That's your problem, you know that?
- What?

06:56.280 --> 06:58.032
You don't know how to relax.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.432
What the hell does that switch do?

07:12.160 --> 07:14.037
Jefferson?

07:15.600 --> 07:19.309
See what happens
when you pull this blue wire.

07:25.800 --> 07:31.193
Two-point-six billion men on the planet
and we didn't marry any of them.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.350
Come on, Al. Call an electrician.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.079
I will not.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.880
Just because someone
calls himself an electrician...

07:39.120 --> 07:43.193
...doesn't mean he knows any more
about electricity than the average guy.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.596
Just as I thought.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.230
Mr. Bundy, I'm Sandy.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.869
Welcome to our study
on human sexuality.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.355
We're going to be exploring
your deepest desires...

08:17.600 --> 08:20.034
...in our cybersex experiment.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.671
We are?

08:25.920 --> 08:27.638
Well, if that's okay.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.673
Because some people are shy and--

08:40.320 --> 08:42.356
Aren't we an eager beaver.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.234
Now, I have something
for you to put on.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.198
Well, no need.
I'm already wearing one.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.314
I think we're a tad confused, Bud.

08:56.560 --> 09:02.715
You see, you will be wearing this
as you enter a world of virtual reality...

09:02.920 --> 09:04.990
...and based on your answers
to our survey...

09:05.240 --> 09:08.152
...we will create
your ideal sexual experience.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.072
I see. I see.

09:11.320 --> 09:15.757
So technically speaking,
who will I be boinking?

09:16.720 --> 09:18.995
Your image of the perfect mate.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.715
That shouldn't be a problem.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.395
But who's gonna hold the magazine?

09:31.920 --> 09:35.151
Okay, one more wire
and we'll be all hooked up.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.075
We're hooked up.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.153
This is Dr. Kessler.
He created this experiment.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.550
Dr. Kessler, this is Bud Bundy.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.349
Look, Dr. Kessler,
I don't mean to doubt...

09:51.600 --> 09:55.070
...your little pleasure pouch here.
But, see, you're dealing with a guy...

09:55.280 --> 09:59.159
...who's had the real thing more times
than there are stars in the sky.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.354
Well, there are more than four stars
in the sky, Mr. Bundy.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.990
Once you get away from the city
and you can...

10:07.200 --> 10:10.272
We'll monitor his vital signs
from the next room.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.790
I have a feeling
it could get ugly in here.

10:14.720 --> 10:15.994
Doc, the point is...

10:16.200 --> 10:18.031
...nothing can duplicate
the real thing.

10:18.240 --> 10:21.516
I mean, there's not a machine in
the world that can actually re-create--

10:25.360 --> 10:29.558
<i>Excuse me, while I kiss the sky.</i>

10:33.040 --> 10:35.713
<i>Oh, big surprise. I'm alone.</i>

10:35.960 --> 10:38.633
<i>My perfect mate is myself.</i>

10:39.440 --> 10:42.830
<i>Last time I tell the truth
on a sex survey.</i>

10:46.320 --> 10:48.470
<i>- Amber?
- Surprised to see me...</i>

10:48.680 --> 10:51.831
- ...in your fantasy, Bud?
- No.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.190
No, not at all.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.718
I mean, it is my fantasy.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.033
So now what do we do?

11:01.280 --> 11:03.111
We have sex.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.438
We do?

11:07.640 --> 11:10.074
You mean just like that?

11:10.320 --> 11:12.117
None of that pretending
to respect you...

11:12.320 --> 11:15.232
...or any of that other junk women
devote entire magazines to?

11:15.680 --> 11:17.193
Nope.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.113
Do with me what you will.

11:29.920 --> 11:33.117
Oh, I recognize this. It's foreplay.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.591
Either that or he has a spastic colon.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.318
Oh, baby, what you do.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.313
Yeah, it's his colon.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.919
Let's get a second opinion.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.157
Hey, Bruno.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.518
What does this look like to you?

11:51.360 --> 11:54.477
Looks like I'm gonna need
a bigger mop.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.874
- Jefferson?
- Yeah?

12:04.120 --> 12:05.758
See what happens when I do this:

12:11.240 --> 12:14.471
Good. So we got power upstairs.

12:34.520 --> 12:38.877
You know, I bet we could teach them
to smoke cigars and ride tricycles.

12:39.640 --> 12:43.030
Al, are you ready to call
an electrician?

12:43.920 --> 12:47.037
I will not. I'm gonna find out
what this darn switch does...

12:47.280 --> 12:50.033
...if it kills me and Jefferson.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.838
Our secret weapon.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.799
Now we'll get to the bottom
of this, Peg.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.750
Let's do it.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.631
Bob Rooney? He's a butcher.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.191
Hence the genius of it.

13:13.400 --> 13:17.916
<i>You see, he owns the entire Time Life
series on household wiring.</i>

13:18.760 --> 13:20.751
Actually, Al,
I don't have those anymore.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.552
My wife made me send them back.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.068
Not before you read them
in the john, right?

13:26.880 --> 13:28.916
Do you know me, or what?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.108
Okay.

13:35.360 --> 13:40.275
- Tell us where the circuit box is.
- Outside.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.633
Thank God for Bob Rooney.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.034
We could have been inside for days.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.316
Guys, please call an electrician.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.755
We will not!

14:04.000 --> 14:05.319
I don't know.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.313
Maybe I was too hard on Bud
the other day.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.796
I mean, he is sort of cute,
don't you think?

14:11.400 --> 14:16.155
Well, yeah, in a crypt-keeper
kind of a way.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.194
Look, Amber,
I know that he really likes you.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.709
Well, maybe I should
give him a break.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.274
Oh, hi, Bud.

14:26.520 --> 14:30.957
I've been thinking about your
invitation, and I'm free Friday.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.156
Oh, good. Good.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.119
You can spend it
hanging with Mr. Cooper.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.193
As for me, I'm kind of busy.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.559
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.395
- In your dreams.
- Yeah, you betcha.

14:57.400 --> 15:02.349
Al, there is not an eyebrow
left among you.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.915
- Please call someone.
- I will not.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.994
All we have to do, Peg, is find out
where the last few of these wires go...

15:11.240 --> 15:13.708
...and I can start my vacation anew.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.313
And what about Bob Rooney?

15:16.520 --> 15:18.397
You know, he's been
missing for two days.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.999
Bob Rooney's not missing.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.112
- Right, Bob Rooney?
- Right, Al.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.113
He's in the wall.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.875
- He is stuck in our house, Al.
- Like he's the only one.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.396
Hey, good news, Al.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.511
Griff thinks he's traced
the problem. Here.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.075
Hang onto this dead wire
while we go to the basement.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.793
Alrighty.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.033
<i>Odd.</i>

15:51.280 --> 15:55.432
<i>I see my entire life
flashing before my eyes.</i>

15:56.200 --> 15:59.875
<i>And that only happens right before--</i>

16:10.040 --> 16:13.555
Hey, Daddy, we need to talk.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.311
What's that smell?

16:17.560 --> 16:19.915
Some hair. Some skin.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.039
- What's up?
- It's Bud, Dad.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.798
He hasn't showered in four days.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.629
He disappears at night and he has no
interest in the opposite sex anymore.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.235
And the problem is?

16:32.480 --> 16:34.835
Daddy, he's like that
and he's not even married.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.359
Pumpkin...

16:36.560 --> 16:41.031
...if there was something up with Bud
don't you think I would know it?

16:42.800 --> 16:45.598
Son, are you okay?

16:45.840 --> 16:47.671
Oh, yeah.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.392
See? Father always knows best.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.309
Now, excuse me. There's two guys
in the basement I've gotta kill.

16:55.960 --> 16:59.077
Hey, Bud. What's in the box?

16:59.320 --> 17:02.676
Just some old things
I don't need anymore.

17:04.520 --> 17:08.194
Your porno magazines
and your rubber dolls.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.351
Okay, Bud, I don't understand.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.238
First you blow off Amber.

17:12.480 --> 17:16.791
The only woman who's ever touched you
without saying, "Excuse me, sonny."

17:17.160 --> 17:18.798
And now this?

17:19.040 --> 17:22.999
Look, Kelly. I don't need Amber, okay.
I have her.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.674
Dr. Kessler introduced me
to cybersex...

17:25.880 --> 17:28.519
...and I can create Amber
any time I want.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.751
But she's not the real Amber.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.318
She's better.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.996
She does what I want,
whenever I want it.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.913
This is the breakthrough
that men have been waiting for...

17:40.120 --> 17:42.156
...since the beginning of time.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.909
You know what? It looks like
you and your cross-legged...

17:46.160 --> 17:48.390
..."let's talk," gift-expecting...

17:48.600 --> 17:51.876
...ordering-the-most-expensive-thing-
on-the-menu, "what about me?"...

17:52.120 --> 17:55.510
...bimbo sapiens
are about to be made obsolete.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.359
Amber, yes.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.759
Excuse me.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.673
Aren't you the world-famous
Dr. Keebler?

18:12.920 --> 18:14.558
Kessler.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.670
And you are?

18:17.920 --> 18:21.799
Dr. Von Bundy.
I specialize in nuclear dentistry.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.512
I've never heard of that department.

18:24.720 --> 18:29.396
Well, it's a top-secret program
between the CIA and Crest...

18:29.640 --> 18:32.712
...but, anyway, enough about me.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.393
Tell me about your work.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.353
Well, I first began
my sexual-behavior studies...

18:37.600 --> 18:39.670
...10 years ago
on the lower primates.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.717
That's these disks here.

18:41.960 --> 18:46.078
With my more recent experiments
I've moved up the evolutionary ladder.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.157
Somewhat.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.988
I see. Fascinating.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.834
So scientifically speaking:

18:58.000 --> 19:02.710
Yes, well, my goal is to prove that the
human male's psycho-sexual needs...

19:02.960 --> 19:04.916
...can be fully satisfied
with my machine.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.754
Thereby eliminating
the embarrassment of rejection.

19:08.120 --> 19:11.237
Do you really think
that you can make this obsolete?

19:17.560 --> 19:20.472
Would you care to discuss this
over a moonlit stroll?

19:20.720 --> 19:22.790
But I have a patient...

19:24.800 --> 19:28.679
...who is now on autopilot.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.159
Yes.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.910
That's the spot.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.673
You know what I like.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.917
You bet I do.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.510
Hey, what happened?

19:49.680 --> 19:52.319
Enjoy, big boy.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.837
God! Oh, God!

20:04.680 --> 20:07.319
Good going, Al.
You have wrecked the house...

20:07.560 --> 20:10.870
...Jefferson and Griff now look like
fried green tomatoes...

20:11.120 --> 20:13.634
...and you still don't know
where that switch goes.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.189
Have you anything at all
to say for yourself?

20:29.320 --> 20:31.550
Al...

20:31.800 --> 20:33.153
...bake me.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.637
- Good night, kids.
- Good night.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.830
<i>- Good night, Bob Rooney.
- Night, Al.</i>

20:46.240 --> 20:49.232
You shake it.
Yeah, you shake it, baby.

20:49.520 --> 20:52.910
That's the Bud I remember.
Good job, Kelly.

20:53.160 --> 20:56.197
Yeah, well, I can't take all the credit.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.198
Yeah, yeah, you.
Yeah, you're the one. Yeah.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.711
That's it.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.637
You shake that booty, baby.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.190
You know what I like.

21:25.960 --> 21:29.669
Al, you better not be fooling
with that switch again.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.309
I'm not, pookie.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.799
What the hell does this thing do?

21:43.600 --> 21:47.388
<i>Man, I gotta find out
where the switch to this light is.</i>
