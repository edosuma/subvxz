00:02.323 --> 00:04.876
You'd rather be blind than deaf?

00:04.943 --> 00:06.932
Bro, what I got to see for?

00:06.999 --> 00:08.666
I done seen it all. Easy call.

00:08.733 --> 00:10.700
You're the only person
I've asked this to

00:10.766 --> 00:12.033
who's chosen blind.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.933
What type of hypothetical
is this, bro,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.133
if everybody had
the same damn answer?

00:16.200 --> 00:17.800
That's a good point, but,
like, being blind would suck.

00:17.866 --> 00:18.833
You can't even see anything.

00:18.900 --> 00:19.866
At least with deaf, you...

00:19.933 --> 00:21.233
It's a similar life, I guess.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.400
Hey. Hey!

00:23.466 --> 00:25.733
Honey, it's, uh, eh...

00:25.800 --> 00:27.666
W‐Wiz Khalifa! Yeah. Honey!

00:27.733 --> 00:28.933
We dem boyz.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.066
‐Wiz!
‐Wiz Khalifa, man, what's up?

00:30.133 --> 00:31.766
‐There he is. That's him.
‐(scoffs)

00:31.833 --> 00:34.666
‐What a tangled web we weave.
‐MAN: There he goes.

00:39.033 --> 00:41.100
‐(French accent): Mademoiselle?
‐Hmm?

00:41.166 --> 00:43.400
‐Thank you.
‐A metal straw
for your ice coffee.

00:43.466 --> 00:45.266
‐You didn't have to do that.
‐(regular voice): I did.

00:45.333 --> 00:46.800
You put the other straw
on the ground.

00:46.866 --> 00:48.000
It was on the ground
for, like, two seconds.

00:48.066 --> 00:49.800
I could have wiped it off.

00:49.866 --> 00:51.766
DAVE:
Oh, look what the cat drug in.

00:51.833 --> 00:53.133
ALLY:
Mm.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.633
Somebody suck me!

00:54.700 --> 00:56.333
‐(Ally laughs)
‐Okay.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.766
Well...
(sighs)

00:58.833 --> 01:00.166
No, I mean, I did.
It's all in the deck.

01:00.233 --> 01:02.600
No, I‐I did exactly what you
asked me... I did all that.

01:02.666 --> 01:04.200
Please let me redo it.
It's my mistake.

01:04.266 --> 01:07.366
Yeah, but I don't‐‐ I don't
understand why that's necessary,

01:07.433 --> 01:09.266
for me to...

01:09.333 --> 01:10.833
Yeah, I'll shave my neck.

01:10.900 --> 01:13.200
Okay, all right.
See you tomorrow.

01:13.266 --> 01:14.733
Somebody suck me.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.566
What a half‐assed
"somebody suck me," man.

01:16.633 --> 01:18.866
You're gonna have bad luck,
dishonoring The Mask like that.

01:18.933 --> 01:20.900
I just feel like this job
is a dead end, man.

01:20.966 --> 01:23.033
It's like, I have the best book
at the company, you know?

01:23.100 --> 01:25.566
They know that, I know that.
I'm just, like, their Pac‐Man.

01:25.633 --> 01:30.100
I'm just eating shit, just
like... (imitating Pac‐Man)

01:30.166 --> 01:32.266
Pac‐Man doesn't eat shit.
He eats whatever

01:32.333 --> 01:34.733
the coinage is
that he levels up with.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.300
‐You should come out
with us tonight, okay?
‐You should.

01:37.366 --> 01:39.433
‐Hmm.
‐Emma got us into this,
like, very cool

01:39.500 --> 01:40.766
Hollywood party.

01:40.833 --> 01:43.133
And tech people
are sponsoring it, I guess.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.366
‐Oh, are‐‐ tech people
are gonna be there?
‐Mm‐hmm.

01:45.433 --> 01:47.366
Well, then, no. Yeah, there's
no chance I would go to that.

01:47.433 --> 01:49.400
‐That's so stupid.
‐There's gonna be
celebrities there.

01:49.466 --> 01:53.266
Like real, a‐above Dave‐level
celebrities. Uh...

01:53.333 --> 01:56.166
‐Hmm.
‐I also, I heard,
I heard that the women

01:56.233 --> 01:59.233
are supposed to put their hands
against the wall like this

01:59.300 --> 02:01.700
and then just look back
at all the men.

02:01.766 --> 02:02.900
A little toe?

02:02.966 --> 02:03.933
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐A little backdoor toe?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.700
‐Yeah, exactly.
‐(Dave laughs)

02:05.766 --> 02:07.333
‐Don't you want to come
to the party?
‐And they're gonna...

02:07.400 --> 02:09.166
Some girls are gonna put
their head down here

02:09.233 --> 02:10.800
‐and talk to you upside down.
‐Like this?

02:10.866 --> 02:12.066
‐Is that so?
‐Yeah.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.400
ALLY:
Please come to the party.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.566
‐Okay, I'm coming.
‐(whoops)

02:14.633 --> 02:16.233
All right, I'll come.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.100
Can't believe you're gonna try
to talk to girls in the shirt

02:18.166 --> 02:19.966
that makes you look
like you're bad at poker.

02:20.033 --> 02:22.566
I love these overalls. If you
scoop more coal into the engine,

02:22.633 --> 02:23.933
will we get there faster, or...?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.166
‐You're so funny.
‐Okay.

02:25.233 --> 02:26.766
DAVE:
I normally hate art, but...

02:26.833 --> 02:29.233
Damn. Emma, this shit is crazy.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.466
This the type of shit
your bitch like right here.

02:31.533 --> 02:32.966
You did all of this?

02:33.033 --> 02:35.400
This cliché bullshit? Hell no.

02:35.466 --> 02:37.766
‐I did the graphics
for the signs.
‐Oh, okay.

02:37.833 --> 02:40.700
It's pretty nice.
You got talent, though.

02:40.766 --> 02:42.733
I got Microsoft Word.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.766
Lights.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.866
I like this.

02:48.933 --> 02:51.633
(chuckles)
Hey, thank you.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.300
What do you think?

02:56.500 --> 02:57.700
DAVE:
Oh. I don't want to talk

02:57.766 --> 02:59.566
about my opinion
in front of the artist.

02:59.633 --> 03:00.900
That's weird.

03:00.966 --> 03:02.900
Oh, no, I mean,
that's totally fine.

03:02.966 --> 03:04.533
Art is meant to spawn
a conversation.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.300
All right. If you really want
to talk about it, I guess,

03:07.366 --> 03:10.266
one question I have is:
how is this art?

03:10.333 --> 03:14.100
Okay, well, um,
what do you think it is?

03:14.166 --> 03:19.666
I think you took a bushel of
flowers and you just plopped it

03:19.733 --> 03:22.000
in a toaster
that you bought somewhere.

03:22.066 --> 03:23.866
‐That's what I'm interpreting.
‐Okay, wait.

03:23.933 --> 03:26.400
I see what's going on here.
You don't like Koons.

03:26.466 --> 03:29.766
Oh, my God. This is not racial
in any way, my man.

03:29.833 --> 03:33.366
No, no. He means,
like, the artist.

03:33.433 --> 03:34.700
Jeff Koons.

03:34.766 --> 03:36.266
You are Koo‐‐
Your name is Koons?

03:36.333 --> 03:37.433
‐No.
‐No, I'm...

03:37.500 --> 03:39.866
(chuckles)
No, I'm‐I'm Marcus.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.933
‐BARTENDER: Here you go.
‐MEGAN: Thank you.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.366
Hey.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.233
I just had an amazing idea.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.700
Okay.

03:47.766 --> 03:50.200
What if we made popcorn
out of baby corn?

03:50.266 --> 03:52.666
Oh, my God.
That would be so cute.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.000
‐Right?
‐Yeah.

03:54.066 --> 03:56.566
I've been thinking about it
for m‐‐ y‐‐ a little bit.

03:56.633 --> 03:57.600
We should do it.

03:57.666 --> 03:59.300
What's all this "we" talk?

03:59.366 --> 04:01.033
You trying to get in on my idea?

04:01.100 --> 04:02.666
‐(laughs): No, I...
‐You are.

04:02.733 --> 04:05.033
‐I mean, you should do it.
‐Thank you.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.500
I appreciate your support.
Don't steal my idea.

04:07.566 --> 04:08.666
(laughs):
Don't.

04:08.733 --> 04:10.833
'Cause I'll, I'll sue you.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.366
‐What?
‐I‐I'm kidding. I wouldn't...

04:12.433 --> 04:13.933
‐(chuckles)
‐I don't even know
how to do that.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.066
But I would, I would fucking
take you to court, for sure,

04:16.133 --> 04:17.633
if you took my idea,
like dead serious.

04:17.700 --> 04:18.900
That's not cool to do that.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.866
‐Uh, okay.
‐I'm joking around. But I did.

04:20.933 --> 04:23.366
I did. I‐‐ My cousin,
I fucked him up bad in court.

04:23.433 --> 04:26.733
I've had s‐‐ IP stolen from me
before and I don't like it.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.533
‐(laughs) I'm kidding.
‐Okay.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.766
‐Let me get you
another free drink.
‐I'm good.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.166
‐Le‐‐ Just one more.
Let me get you one more.
‐No, you know what, I'm good.

04:33.233 --> 04:36.366
‐Uh, best of luck, really.
‐Well..

04:36.433 --> 04:39.133
I was just kidding around.

04:40.233 --> 04:43.266
Bro, is that...?
Do you know who that is?

04:43.333 --> 04:45.900
‐GATA: Who, Trippie Redd?
‐Yeah, bro.

04:45.966 --> 04:48.200
I want to produce for him
so fucking bad, dawg.

04:48.266 --> 04:51.133
Well, why don't you just walk
your ass up to him and tell him?

04:51.200 --> 04:54.200
I'm smacked as fuck right now,
and I don't want to be

04:54.266 --> 04:56.733
that weird guy who walks up
to him at an art gallery like,

04:56.800 --> 04:58.766
"Yo, what's up, T?
Let me fucking..."

04:58.833 --> 05:01.766
‐You want me to introduce you?
‐Uh, do‐‐ you don't even

05:01.833 --> 05:03.666
‐know him, though.
‐Man, watch this shit.

05:03.733 --> 05:05.500
But you don't even know him.

05:05.566 --> 05:08.233
GATA:
My boy Trippie.
What's good, my nigga?

05:09.600 --> 05:12.066
‐The fuck is you?
‐It's Gata.

05:12.133 --> 05:15.000
Come on, man, you gonna act
like you don't know me, bro?

05:15.066 --> 05:16.866
We was just at Soho House, man.

05:16.933 --> 05:18.900
Oh, don't give me that.

05:18.966 --> 05:20.666
My mom and your mom is cool.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.100
You don't remember,
from the barbecue, brah?

05:22.166 --> 05:23.700
My mom is
Catherine Branton, bro.

05:23.766 --> 05:26.266
Nah, I don't know who that is.

05:26.333 --> 05:29.433
‐(sighs)
‐Hey.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.266
I'm sorry. Uh, I'm a huge fan
of your shit, bro.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.100
I listen to your shit
all the time.

05:34.166 --> 05:36.166
By chance, do you have, like, an
engineer or anything right now?

05:36.233 --> 05:37.733
You know what
I'm saying, like...

05:38.566 --> 05:40.600
‐Nah.
‐Okay.

05:40.666 --> 05:43.166
I don't ever, like, do this,
but like, bro, I'm that guy

05:43.233 --> 05:44.700
when it comes
to engineering, like...

05:44.766 --> 05:46.166
I'm‐a say it, yeah,
I'm the fucking one.

05:46.233 --> 05:48.066
‐GATA: The truth.
‐And I think that I can take

05:48.133 --> 05:50.700
your music to whatever
the next level is,

05:50.766 --> 05:52.366
you know, quality‐wise.

05:52.433 --> 05:55.000
Not anything else, though, like,
you got your own fucking swag

05:55.066 --> 05:57.933
going down, big dawg,
and it's fucking hard, so...

05:58.000 --> 06:00.466
Bet. Let me get your info.

06:00.533 --> 06:01.633
Really?

06:01.700 --> 06:04.066
‐Yeah.
‐Okay.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.333
(laughs softly)

06:15.433 --> 06:17.833
‐What's up?
‐Sup?

06:17.900 --> 06:19.100
You guys throw a great party.

06:19.166 --> 06:21.600
Oh, no, I'm not‐‐ I'm not, uh,
I'm not with these guys.

06:21.666 --> 06:23.866
I‐I'm, uh, I'm in finance.

06:23.933 --> 06:26.566
‐Uh, nocturnal stock trader.
‐Really?

06:26.633 --> 06:27.966
‐Yeah.
‐What kind of stuff?

06:28.033 --> 06:30.500
I've been pushing my clients
to diversify.

06:30.566 --> 06:32.366
Are‐are you in finance?

06:32.433 --> 06:33.766
Yeah‐‐ well, music manager.

06:33.833 --> 06:35.433
‐Oh, rock and roll. Very cool.
‐Mm‐hmm.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.138
‐Mm‐hmm, yeah.
‐You‐‐ So you don't just
handle the contracts,

06:38.205 --> 06:40.074
‐you also do
their investment portfolio?
‐Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

06:40.141 --> 06:42.041
‐You do. Wow.
‐Absolutely. Yeah.

06:42.108 --> 06:44.308
That's interesting.

06:46.977 --> 06:48.599
Okay, so the master
is the recording, right,

06:48.665 --> 06:51.080
‐and the publishing
is the songwriting?
‐Exactly.

06:51.146 --> 06:52.780
Right, so the artist
has two streams of income.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.746
You can't have one without the
other, you have to have both.

06:54.813 --> 06:56.213
No, no, y‐you're not
getting what I'm saying.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.713
No, I am getting
what you're saying.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.080
You're not hearing
what I'm saying.

06:59.146 --> 07:00.780
Of course they're gonna give
on the royalty

07:00.846 --> 07:02.213
if they're getting 10x
on the publishing.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.146
It's called pub.

07:04.213 --> 07:05.746
Is it?

07:05.813 --> 07:08.946
YOUNG THUG:
Yo, man, I'm telling y'all about

07:09.013 --> 07:10.280
this Mafia game.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.780
Tom Hanks put me down on it.

07:11.846 --> 07:14.470
And plus, he's, like,
the best finesser in the world.

07:14.537 --> 07:17.037
I mean, I can't believe
I honestly met him.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.304
‐Oh, my God. That's Young Thug.
‐Really?

07:19.370 --> 07:21.137
That's Young Thug
right there, yes.

07:21.204 --> 07:22.870
Mafia sucks.

07:22.937 --> 07:24.537
Young Thug, you got to stop
surrounding yourself

07:24.604 --> 07:27.137
with, like,
yes‐men and theater dorks.

07:27.204 --> 07:30.104
Wait, what? That's Forrest Gump.

07:30.170 --> 07:32.870
That's Gunna as well. Should
we go over‐‐ Yeah? Oh, my God.

07:32.937 --> 07:35.070
‐EMMA: Like I said.
‐GUNNA: What are you talking
about?

07:35.137 --> 07:37.504
That's‐that's Woody
from Toy Story.

07:37.570 --> 07:39.970
Hey, guys, you mind if we join?

07:40.037 --> 07:42.337
GUNNA:
Sure.

07:45.104 --> 07:46.570
Thank you.

07:46.637 --> 07:48.637
(coughing)

07:57.237 --> 07:59.470
Dude, are you sick?

08:00.437 --> 08:03.870
No. Just, like, weed cough.

08:03.937 --> 08:07.037
‐So m...
‐(coughing)

08:07.104 --> 08:09.270
So much phlegm.

08:09.337 --> 08:12.737
Unbelievable amount of phlegm
in that cough.

08:12.804 --> 08:15.504
You know, hey, bro, you was
sick, like, two days ago.

08:15.570 --> 08:18.337
Yeah, I was sick, um,
at, um, earlier this week,

08:18.404 --> 08:20.604
but I'm not contagious anymore.

08:20.670 --> 08:22.704
How do you know if you're
not contagious anymore?

08:22.770 --> 08:25.170
Like, how could you possibly
deduce that?

08:25.237 --> 08:26.870
Who‐who knows when
they are contagious?

08:26.937 --> 08:29.404
Uh, are you a doctor?

08:29.470 --> 08:31.870
I'm not a doctor. I'm just
implying that neither...

08:31.937 --> 08:33.837
By the way, such a big fan.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.770
I am just a rapper as well,
and I have

08:35.837 --> 08:37.870
so much stuff to do this week,
and I‐‐ Y‐You would know.

08:37.937 --> 08:40.270
You can't record with a
stuffed nose or a sore throat.

08:40.337 --> 08:42.157
I just, you know... I‐‐

08:42.224 --> 08:46.824
It's a dream to be here, but
I have to exit if you're sick.

08:46.891 --> 08:48.691
I'm such a big fan
of both of you,

08:48.757 --> 08:50.024
and if you are sick,
you shouldn't be...

08:50.091 --> 08:51.191
‐Fuck out of here.
‐Okay.

08:51.257 --> 08:52.857
I'm just saying,
let yourself heal.

08:52.924 --> 08:56.124
‐Don't smoke if you're sick.
‐Okay, bye, Young Thug.

08:58.891 --> 09:02.124
‐Yo, this nigga rap?
‐Kinda.

09:02.191 --> 09:03.557
‐He can't be a rapper.
‐(scoffs)

09:03.624 --> 09:04.891
Dressed like that?

09:04.957 --> 09:07.724
‐(laughs)
‐No fucking rap... (coughs)

09:07.791 --> 09:09.757
(coughing)

09:09.824 --> 09:12.091
(hacking)

09:12.157 --> 09:13.857
Fuck.

09:13.924 --> 09:16.191
Fucking Young Thug.

09:16.257 --> 09:17.757
(hacking)

09:17.824 --> 09:19.457
MIKE:
David.

09:19.524 --> 09:21.191
What?

09:21.257 --> 09:22.824
What are you doing here?
Are you just standing here

09:22.891 --> 09:24.657
‐by yourself, doing nothing?
‐Uh, yeah.

09:24.724 --> 09:27.424
I can be alone with my thoughts.
I'm not a mental weakling.

09:27.491 --> 09:31.157
I want to run something
by you, though, um...

09:31.224 --> 09:34.024
‐You want to get situated?
‐No.

09:34.857 --> 09:37.057
Okay, uh, here it goes.

09:37.124 --> 09:39.724
I want to be your manager.

09:42.824 --> 09:45.724
‐Really?
‐Yeah, really.

09:47.624 --> 09:50.191
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

09:50.257 --> 09:54.724
Okay, well, I disagree.
Uh, I wholeheartedly disagree.

09:54.791 --> 09:56.791
Wh‐Why do you think
it's not a good idea?

09:56.857 --> 09:58.291
‐Why?
‐Yeah.

09:58.357 --> 10:00.191
Uh, how about
'cause you know nothing

10:00.257 --> 10:02.724
about the entire music industry.
How's that for an idea?

10:02.791 --> 10:04.324
Do you really think
it's that complicated?

10:04.391 --> 10:06.157
Last night
I talked to a music manager.

10:06.224 --> 10:08.124
H‐He told me
exactly what he does,

10:08.191 --> 10:11.524
which took all of 15 entire
minutes. Not that hard, okay?

10:11.591 --> 10:13.791
You know I went to school for
business. I'm a business major.

10:13.857 --> 10:15.457
I'm not concerned about
the workflow as much

10:15.524 --> 10:17.924
as I'm concerned about, like,
the cultural difference here.

10:17.991 --> 10:19.324
Oh, I am culturally hip.

10:19.391 --> 10:21.557
I'd like‐‐ I want to fuck girls
who wear Pumas.

10:21.624 --> 10:23.457
I get it. I'm‐I'm a cool guy.

10:23.524 --> 10:25.124
Also, last night I chopped it up

10:25.191 --> 10:28.957
with the most famous rapper I've
ever met, uh‐uh, Todd Dillerson.

10:29.024 --> 10:31.657
‐Todd Dillerson?
‐Yeah, Todd Dillerson.

10:31.724 --> 10:33.224
Ty Dolla Sign?

10:33.291 --> 10:36.191
Ty Dolla Si‐‐ that's it,
Ty Dolla Sign. Yeah, him.

10:36.257 --> 10:37.924
I thought it was
more formal to say Todd...

10:37.991 --> 10:39.591
‐His name's not Todd Dillerson.
‐Right. I get it.

10:39.657 --> 10:41.591
‐Are you joking?
‐Okay. Whatever.

10:41.657 --> 10:43.357
You're getting lost in the
details. That‐That‐That's...

10:43.424 --> 10:45.357
Aren't you the guy who runs
a rinky‐dink operation that lets

10:45.424 --> 10:48.157
rappers take tens of thousands
of dollars from him on a whim?

10:48.224 --> 10:51.357
You don't even own
LilDicky.com.

10:51.424 --> 10:54.091
It's not like I didn't attempt
to buy LilDicky.com.

10:54.157 --> 10:56.891
It was taken on GoDaddy,
so I had to get LilDicky2.com.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.891
‐It is what it is.
‐Right. Well, LilDicky2, I...

10:58.957 --> 11:00.924
reached out to the guy
that owns LilDicky,

11:00.991 --> 11:02.224
and I bought it from him.

11:02.291 --> 11:04.424
‐You have LilDicky.com?
‐Yes. We,

11:04.491 --> 11:06.191
we have LilDicky.com.

11:07.391 --> 11:08.557
Okay.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.857
This is a lot to absorb
right now.

11:10.924 --> 11:12.957
(sighs)
Look, Dave...

11:13.024 --> 11:15.109
I need a challenge, okay?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.409
I‐I need something new
in my life.

11:16.475 --> 11:17.709
I'm not happy right now, at all.

11:17.775 --> 11:19.842
And you need
someone who's smart‐‐ me‐‐

11:19.909 --> 11:23.209
and who gives a shit about you
that you trust.

11:23.275 --> 11:25.142
Do you believe in me
as a rapper?

11:25.209 --> 11:28.875
As much as it pains me
to say it, I do, I really do.

11:28.942 --> 11:30.642
Why?

11:30.709 --> 11:32.475
Because you've got it.
I don't know what that is.

11:32.542 --> 11:33.975
I always thought
that was bullshit.

11:34.042 --> 11:36.175
‐Hmm.
‐But without me
or somebody like me,

11:36.242 --> 11:39.542
I‐I don't think you'll ever
reach your full potential.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.109
If I go through with this...

11:43.175 --> 11:45.309
‐Mm‐hmm?
‐...it's a trial run, okay?

11:45.375 --> 11:48.075
I don't want you quitting
your job right now.

11:48.142 --> 11:49.975
‐I don't want...
‐(laughs): My j...

11:50.042 --> 11:51.775
I'm not gonna quit my job.

11:51.842 --> 11:53.975
No. You‐‐
This is my side hustle.

11:54.042 --> 11:55.375
You're gonna be my priority,

11:55.442 --> 11:56.675
‐but I need to make money.
‐Yeah, you're getting

11:56.742 --> 11:58.842
20% of, like, the next Kanye‐‐
are you kidding?

11:58.909 --> 12:00.309
It's the biggest opportunity
you'll ever get

12:00.375 --> 12:02.509
‐in your entire life.
‐Wow, yeah,
I guess if I do the math

12:02.575 --> 12:05.409
right here in front of you, 20%
of what you're making right now,

12:05.475 --> 12:08.442
then if that, if I carry‐‐
and then my cut is...

12:08.509 --> 12:11.675
Oh, is my cut zero? You
don't make any fucking money.

12:11.742 --> 12:13.542
All right, look.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.709
I'm struggling
seeing a downside here,

12:15.775 --> 12:18.075
because if it doesn't work out,
I just fire you.

12:18.142 --> 12:19.642
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐No skin off my clit.

12:19.709 --> 12:22.109
And honestly,
the ability to fire you

12:22.175 --> 12:23.942
is almost reason enough
to hire you.

12:24.009 --> 12:26.709
Like, what a joy that would be
to just let you know that you've

12:26.775 --> 12:29.409
been terminated.
So let's see how it goes.

12:29.475 --> 12:31.409
‐Are‐are you being serious?
‐I'm willing to give you

12:31.475 --> 12:32.742
the title "interim manager."

12:32.809 --> 12:34.509
Wonderful. Okay,
I'll get started right away.

12:34.575 --> 12:36.275
So‐so, do you have a business
account or something, or...?

12:36.342 --> 12:37.709
I'm gonna put you on an e‐email

12:37.775 --> 12:39.209
‐with the guy who does it.
‐All right, perfect.

12:39.275 --> 12:41.709
MIKE (over phone): Could you
send me the last three years

12:41.775 --> 12:43.909
‐of his tax returns, please?
‐Okay. I'll send you

12:43.975 --> 12:45.142
the last five, okay?

12:45.209 --> 12:47.109
Hey, you get zip files?

12:47.175 --> 12:49.109
Yeah. Yes, I do.

12:49.175 --> 12:51.009
But you don't ha‐have
to do that, Don.

12:51.075 --> 12:54.409
No, no, that's okay.
Already, I'm selecting...

12:54.475 --> 12:55.675
and dragging...

12:55.742 --> 12:56.742
and zipping.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.375
I'll let you know
when it's zipped, okay?

12:58.442 --> 13:00.375
Okay, Don.
Looking forward to it.

13:00.442 --> 13:02.475
Hey, I‐I got to tell you, Mike,
Carol and I,

13:02.542 --> 13:05.275
we're just so happy that
you've taken Dave's finances

13:05.342 --> 13:06.675
under your wing.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.175
Trust me, I have a front‐row
seat to his spending.

13:08.242 --> 13:10.609
It's unbelievable. We have
three Roombas at the house,

13:10.675 --> 13:12.442
‐and we don't even have carpet.
‐Look at...

13:12.509 --> 13:16.175
look at this‐‐ $42
on a delivery dinner for one.

13:16.242 --> 13:18.675
And‐and why did we get him
the Camry

13:18.742 --> 13:21.009
if he's just going to Uber
everywhere?

13:21.075 --> 13:23.442
Well, at least he does
FaceTime us when he's Uber'ing.

13:23.509 --> 13:25.775
‐Yeah, but the data, the data.
‐That's true.

13:25.842 --> 13:27.075
Hey, hey, Mike, uh,

13:27.142 --> 13:29.409
‐you got a Sam's Club nearby?
‐Okay. Um...

13:29.475 --> 13:31.309
You should get Dave
a Sam's Club membership.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.209
He can just use ours.

13:33.275 --> 13:35.175
‐Um...
‐No, that‐that would be illegal.

13:35.242 --> 13:36.809
We use Karen Smiley's
Hulu account.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.742
‐Is that illegal?
‐You can't compare.

13:38.809 --> 13:41.875
‐We're taking a little bit
of a stream once or...
‐Guys?

13:41.942 --> 13:44.309
‐once or twice... wi‐with fraud.
‐Guys? I got to go.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.509
‐I got to jump.
‐And you think
it's gonna hurt somebody?

13:46.575 --> 13:48.209
‐I think it's...
‐Sam?

13:48.275 --> 13:50.642
‐I don't want to get
in trouble. I...
‐All right, bye‐bye.

13:50.709 --> 13:54.309
Michael! He hung up.
Because you came.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.209
‐What?!
‐Shit.

14:00.575 --> 14:02.309
(laughing):
Mike?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.909
‐Yeah.
‐Wait‐wait‐wait.

14:03.975 --> 14:05.909
‐Mike?
‐Yes.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.375
(laughing)

14:07.442 --> 14:09.309
(mock loud laughter)

14:09.375 --> 14:11.542
Yeah, man, I have ambition.
I make moves.

14:11.609 --> 14:13.809
"Hi. I'm Lil Dicky,
and this is my large leprechaun.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.975
"He manages me. If you have
any business inquiries,

14:16.042 --> 14:17.742
talk to him."
(laughing)

14:17.809 --> 14:19.642
Shit, man,
I think it's tight, man.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.342
Mike is family, bro.
We got to keep it

14:21.409 --> 14:23.042
in the fam, keep the grass cut.

14:23.109 --> 14:25.609
I‐I agree with... What does
that mean, the "grass cut"?

14:25.675 --> 14:27.642
‐Ah.
‐Keep the grass cut, fool,
so the snakes'll show.

14:27.709 --> 14:30.442
Bro, you got to be able to see
what's going on out here.

14:30.509 --> 14:32.309
Snakes. Oh, he's not a snake,
you're saying.

14:32.375 --> 14:33.809
Yeah, he's...
I can trust him. Exactly.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.609
That is a big factor.
Look, I understand

14:35.675 --> 14:37.442
that it's a weird choice,
but he was

14:37.509 --> 14:39.075
the smartest guy
in my entire college.

14:39.142 --> 14:41.442
I used to be in class with him,
and he would get in arguments

14:41.509 --> 14:42.609
with professors
and win the arguments

14:42.675 --> 14:44.009
in front of the whole class

14:44.075 --> 14:45.209
and humiliate the profe...

14:45.275 --> 14:47.075
‐It was like Finding Forrester.
‐ELZ: But...

14:47.142 --> 14:50.042
mixing business with pleasure's
a terrible fucking idea.

14:50.109 --> 14:52.209
‐We do it all the time.
‐I find nothing pleasurable

14:52.275 --> 14:55.642
about working with you‐‐ I think
you need to understand that

14:55.709 --> 14:57.542
‐before we do anything else.
‐I'm okay.

14:57.609 --> 14:58.975
Let me ask you this, though‐‐
does he understand

14:59.042 --> 15:01.509
that he works for you, like,
as an employee and, you know?

15:01.575 --> 15:05.309
‐I... Yeah, I think so.
‐Somebody suck me!

15:05.375 --> 15:06.475
(laughter)

15:06.542 --> 15:08.375
‐DAVE: Hi.
‐That's me as your mucus

15:08.442 --> 15:09.642
to the neti pot.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.809
‐Mm‐hmm, right.
‐(laughs) Also,

15:11.875 --> 15:14.975
I was 90% sure that
this was the right room,

15:15.042 --> 15:16.675
but, like, what if it wasn't?

15:16.742 --> 15:18.442
‐DAVE: Yeah. Bold entrance.
‐Can you imagine?

15:18.509 --> 15:20.209
See? Neti pot? Mike's job.

15:20.275 --> 15:21.575
DAVE:
Thanks, pie.

15:21.642 --> 15:24.042
‐You're welcome.
‐Where's the distilled water?

15:24.109 --> 15:25.775
I forgot it.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.209
I'm sorry.
But you could just use, like...

15:28.275 --> 15:29.575
Tap water?

15:29.642 --> 15:31.442
‐Yeah.
‐How? It needs distilled water.

15:31.509 --> 15:33.809
It goes up my nose,
it's next door to my brain.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.409
You said this was gonna be
a Mike job now?

15:36.475 --> 15:38.075
‐Mike task.
‐Yeah, that checks out.

15:38.142 --> 15:40.042
Maybe we should loop him in.

15:40.109 --> 15:41.342
He would have brought the water.

15:41.409 --> 15:42.542
‐(Elz laughs)
‐Wow.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.109
I'm sorry,
I appreciate you, pie.

15:44.175 --> 15:47.075
Yeah, uh, you can neti
somewhere else, because I have

15:47.142 --> 15:49.675
Trippie Redd coming, and
obviously he's a scary person.

15:49.742 --> 15:51.309
‐He's coming soon?
‐Now.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.309
Okay, I'll go neti. BRB.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.142
‐Hey.
‐What's up, rock star!

15:55.209 --> 15:56.809
‐God!
‐Ooh, my little baby.

15:56.875 --> 15:59.275
Well, shit, Elz,
now that he gone,

15:59.342 --> 16:00.509
what's up with some studio time,
let your boy

16:00.575 --> 16:02.842
‐spit some bars?
‐Gata, you rap, too?

16:02.909 --> 16:03.942
Come on, Ally.

16:04.009 --> 16:05.242
‐He does rap.
‐Mm.

Right now he does not.

16:06.742 --> 16:07.642
You owe me, bro.

16:07.709 --> 16:09.575
‐I owe you? For what?
‐I put you

16:09.642 --> 16:11.009

at the art show, bro.

16:11.075 --> 16:12.709
You wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for me.

16:12.775 --> 16:15.109
How? 'Cause you walked up to him
and tried to convince him that

16:15.175 --> 16:17.442
‐your mothers were friends?
‐I can't get nothing in?

16:17.509 --> 16:19.342
I need some studio time.

16:19.409 --> 16:21.409

16:22.209 --> 16:23.242

16:28.842 --> 16:31.875

16:31.942 --> 16:33.409
It is a tragic...

16:33.475 --> 16:35.809
Yo, Sixers‐Suns, ESPN.
You want to watch?

16:35.875 --> 16:37.842
Oh, brother, I am knee‐deep
on this penguin doc.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.009
You should sit
and check this out. It's so sad.

16:40.075 --> 16:41.975
Their home is depleting
at such a rapid rate.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.142

‐Mm‐hmm.

16:46.609 --> 16:48.042
You're gonna play
the client card

16:48.109 --> 16:51.275
for the Sixers‐Phoenix Suns
regular season game?

16:51.342 --> 16:53.075
That's part
of my creative process.

16:53.142 --> 16:55.575
I love watching the Sixers
beat the shit out of the Suns.

16:55.642 --> 16:57.309
Gets me going,
so gonna need to...

16:57.375 --> 17:00.775
You know, usually, part of the
creative process is creating,

17:00.842 --> 17:03.342
so give a manager something
to manage.

‐Brilliant.

17:11.409 --> 17:12.842

‐Do you have...?

17:21.942 --> 17:23.775

‐Yeah. Work should be

17:23.842 --> 17:25.742
the top priority.
I think you were right.

17:25.809 --> 17:27.742
Well, it should, but I am...
Oh, man.

17:27.809 --> 17:29.642
I'm‐I'm clocked out right now,
so...

17:29.709 --> 17:31.275
Really? But the industry's 24/7.

17:31.342 --> 17:32.942
I'm surprised
you'd ever be clocked out.

17:33.009 --> 17:35.709
I could also just fire you.

you have something to lay down?

17:52.375 --> 17:54.342
Don't you have some bars, baby?
I...

17:54.409 --> 17:55.909
Unless everything
was just a big show

17:55.975 --> 17:57.275

17:59.009 --> 18:00.375
Don't say another word.

18:00.442 --> 18:02.242
I'm recording audio.

we had a productive day?

19:21.707 --> 19:23.373
DAVE:
Unfortunately not.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.707
I, uh...
I can't get much recording done.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.907
My nose is stuffed as a piñata.

19:27.973 --> 19:29.540
(sucks in through teeth)
I understand how that's hard

19:29.607 --> 19:31.173
to get over
that humongous obstacle,

19:31.240 --> 19:33.440
but, you know, we got to get
some kind of schedule going.

19:33.507 --> 19:37.473

19:41.507 --> 19:43.607
It's an annoying trait
that you have.

19:43.673 --> 19:45.307
We just need to have some kind
of rhythm here.

19:45.373 --> 19:48.007
You know what I mean? Like,
in the morning, what if, uh,

19:48.073 --> 19:51.007
that's when you start messing
with beats, and then by lunch,

19:51.073 --> 19:53.607
we got some lyrics laid down,
some verses?

19:53.673 --> 19:56.773
And then, by dinnertime,
we got a hook or two.

19:56.840 --> 20:00.407
Then, end of day,
we got... we got a song.

20:00.473 --> 20:02.007
That's a full song, right?

20:02.073 --> 20:05.407
Oh, wait. The order is
fucked up? What...?

20:05.473 --> 20:06.873
Okay, fine. Do the...

20:06.940 --> 20:08.540
Maybe the hook come
before the...

20:08.607 --> 20:09.940
The hook'll be...
What‐what...?

20:10.007 --> 20:11.440
However that you arrange it
doesn't fucking matter.

20:11.507 --> 20:13.707
But we got to have some kind of,
like, system.

20:13.773 --> 20:15.007
Do you know what I'm saying?

20:15.073 --> 20:17.440
Did you just, like,
Wikipedia "music"?

20:17.507 --> 20:19.073
Beats, hooks, ver...
That's like...

20:19.140 --> 20:20.907
‐You sound...
‐Yesterday you spent three hours

20:20.973 --> 20:22.440
responding
to Instagram comments.

20:22.507 --> 20:24.207
That's called fan engagement,
bucko.

20:24.273 --> 20:27.273
And you're welcome for taking
all the time out to do that.

20:27.340 --> 20:28.573
‐That's good for our brand.
‐Okay.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.473
Valid. You also spent
one of those hours

20:30.540 --> 20:32.607
only responding to one guy
that said you suck.

20:32.673 --> 20:34.607
I'm totally okay
if a guy doesn't like me,

20:34.673 --> 20:36.773
but to say that I'm derivative
is just contradictory.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.540
Like, he‐‐
his argument made no sense.

20:38.607 --> 20:40.173
‐I'm not derivative. That's...
‐No, you're not.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.607
You are very original.
You're the only artist I know

20:41.673 --> 20:42.807
that doesn't put out anything.

20:42.873 --> 20:45.173
You got to have
some kind of, like,

20:45.240 --> 20:46.673
structure, you know?
It's got to be like a job.

20:46.740 --> 20:49.073
I don't know what to tell you.
My process is very slow.

20:49.140 --> 20:51.773
Gata always says "You can't
rush greatness." I agree.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.040
Gata's also the same guy
that asked me yesterday

20:54.107 --> 20:56.373
if a rhinoceros is real.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.673
‐What do you mean?
‐Like a real thing.

20:58.740 --> 21:01.573
It... (sighs)
Because they're extinct?

21:01.640 --> 21:03.007
No.

21:03.073 --> 21:05.307
I'm still waiting
on a valid suggestion here.

21:05.373 --> 21:08.573
‐Like, do you have
any non‐cockamamie ideas?
‐Oh, okay, okay.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.807
I think if the music thing
is not working right now‐‐

21:10.873 --> 21:12.740
no vibes are kicking,
I get that‐‐

21:12.807 --> 21:15.773
then maybe we should go viral.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.607
Go viral?

21:17.673 --> 21:19.573
You‐you... you put out a video

21:19.640 --> 21:22.240
that you know is clickbait.
You know, lures people.

21:22.307 --> 21:23.673
We'll put a titty
in the thumbnail.

21:23.740 --> 21:26.207
The‐the cowboy kid did it
at Walmart.

21:26.273 --> 21:27.740
He was just singing in Walmart.

21:27.807 --> 21:29.740
Some... you know, like,
some country bumpkin was like,

21:29.807 --> 21:31.273
(Southern accent): "Look at him
singing in the aisle."

21:31.340 --> 21:32.473
And they put that dude on Ellen.

21:33.873 --> 21:36.140

so...

21:36.207 --> 21:37.773
it's gonna happen.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.907

how dumb the Internet is.

What‐what are you doing anyway?

21:44.040 --> 21:45.640
