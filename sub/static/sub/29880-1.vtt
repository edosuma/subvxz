01:23.166 --> 01:24.250
This is Yardley.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.754
Which is supposed to be
a very good liberal art school.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.351
Definitely tonguey
enough for my mother.

01:30.497 --> 01:32.409
With its beautiful rural campus.

01:32.559 --> 01:36.897
Which is total bullshit, because
you get ticks, walking in the grass.

01:38.282 --> 01:41.368
Yardley is more structured
than the first college I went to.

01:42.035 --> 01:46.790
I lasted a few months at one of those
serious Ivy League sudo intellectual joints,

01:46.957 --> 01:50.752
which my mother thought would
give me an "appropriate" education.

01:51.253 --> 01:54.548
She says I have a high IQ, and
I'm not living up to my potential.

01:54.715 --> 01:58.324
Even though last weekend I
made 20 grand playing poker.

01:58.467 --> 01:59.726
But I'll get to that.

02:00.490 --> 02:03.117
Yardley is where I met
Ashleigh, from a school paper.

02:03.782 --> 02:05.867
That's my girlfriend - Ashleigh Enright.

02:06.034 --> 02:08.329
My dad knew one of her
father's banks in Arizona.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.426
And naturally, with
those family credentials,

02:10.426 --> 02:13.407
my mother wants us to
get married, sight unseen.

02:13.844 --> 02:15.554
It's the one area I
agree on with my mother.

02:15.721 --> 02:18.100
Because even though we've
only been going out for a few months.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.154
I'm hopelessly in 
love with Ashleigh.

02:20.552 --> 02:23.304
I got an interview
with Roland Pollard.

02:23.365 --> 02:26.452
Oh my Gosh, that is amazing.
How did you land that?

02:27.286 --> 02:29.371
He has a new movie
coming out this fall.

02:29.538 --> 02:31.774
And the assignment originally
went to Priscilla McCain,

02:31.774 --> 02:34.548
but she's totally got
mono, so I'm doing it.

02:34.673 --> 02:37.035
Mono's like a two
credit chores at the school.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.507
Listen Ash, I think
this is great for you.

02:39.634 --> 02:40.484
When is it?

02:40.639 --> 02:43.058
It's the 28th of this month.
A Saturday.

02:44.017 --> 02:45.018
And it's on campus?

02:46.478 --> 02:49.731
- It's in Manhattan.
- It's in Manhattan, are you serious?

02:49.898 --> 02:53.485
This is fantastic, we were always talking
about going into Manhattan for a special weekend.

02:55.190 --> 02:57.192
Look, I'm going to make a
reservation at the Carlyle.

02:57.267 --> 02:58.950
It's the place I'm
always telling you about,

02:58.950 --> 03:02.869
with the piano player at the bar,
he sings his old Broadway tunes.

03:03.249 --> 03:05.463
I'll take you up for lunch and
dinner, how does that sound?

03:05.606 --> 03:06.804
We go see around city.

03:06.804 --> 03:08.202
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

03:08.457 --> 03:10.251
I mean, it will cost a fortune.

03:10.584 --> 03:13.754
Relax, I'm loaded, I scored
20 big ones last Sunday.

03:14.672 --> 03:17.216
- Not another crap game?
- No, stud poker this time.

03:17.143 --> 03:21.095
Sitting there with 3 tens, and some
guy with aces up keeps raising me.

03:22.471 --> 03:24.765
How did you get all the money
to play in such a big poker game?

03:24.932 --> 03:26.517
My horse came in this weekend.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.885
I'm telling you this is
why I have to go to Vegas.

03:28.885 --> 03:31.117
I'm a gambler and I don't
know how else to put it.

03:31.612 --> 03:34.177
I've always wanted you to
have to show me around Manhattan.

03:34.177 --> 03:35.856
This is going to be
absolutely fantastic.

03:36.146 --> 03:38.158
I'm going to, maybe, get in
touch with my dad's ticket brocker.

03:38.158 --> 03:40.434
He'll get us tickets to
Hamilton, how does that sound?

03:40.602 --> 03:43.396
Actually, I don't want all my
parents know I'm in town that weekend.

03:44.078 --> 03:45.083
Why not?

03:45.083 --> 03:47.252
My mother is having 
her big annual fall gala,

03:47.252 --> 03:49.116
and she's apoplectic 
I'm not coming.

03:49.803 --> 03:53.182
I told her I have a major paper due,
otherwise I have to put an appearence.

03:53.349 --> 03:55.140
It's like death.
It's like having ...

03:55.556 --> 03:57.494
Drinks with a hundred
bullshit people,

03:57.494 --> 04:00.247
not one of which has ever
been turned down by a co-op.

04:01.540 --> 04:02.855
I can't believe it.

04:03.296 --> 04:06.358
An interview with the
director of "Winter Memories".

04:06.502 --> 04:09.201
Didn't we see "Winter Memories"
together on our first date?

04:09.201 --> 04:09.944
I think so.

04:09.944 --> 04:11.154
I'm just so excited.

04:12.155 --> 04:15.367
You have to help me come up with
the list of profound questions to ask him.

04:15.867 --> 04:17.288
I don't want to come
off like a twit.

04:17.288 --> 04:18.685
You are not going
to come off like a twit.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.094
Actually, now that
I'm thinking about it.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.289
We can't stay at the Carlyle,
it's too close to my parents house.

04:22.289 --> 04:24.127
But I want you to have a park view.
You know what?

04:24.127 --> 04:25.260
We going to stay at the Pierre.

04:25.401 --> 04:28.667
That way you can have a park view,
it's a safe distance from my parents house.

04:28.654 --> 04:31.400
Then after dinner we're going
to go to the Carlyle, we go to bar,

04:31.538 --> 04:32.709
and spend some time there.

04:32.709 --> 04:36.921
It's very old New York. I really love it.
The murals are by Ludwig Bemelmans.

04:39.882 --> 04:41.801
I've only been to Manhattan
twice, you know.

04:42.385 --> 04:45.012
Once when I was 2, and
then once when I was 12.

04:46.478 --> 04:49.148
All I remember is we
got incredible bargains.

04:49.315 --> 04:51.004
My parents could not
believe that you could buy

04:51.004 --> 04:54.167
a Birkin bag and a Rolex
on the blanket off the street.

04:54.452 --> 04:55.828
For only 200 dollars.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:07.048 --> 05:09.842
Are there any other questions
you can think of that I can ask him?

05:13.096 --> 05:15.223
Find out who influenced
him more on love.

05:15.131 --> 05:18.267
Denis de Rougemont
or Ortega y Gasset.

05:19.435 --> 05:21.187
How do you always
know all that stuff?

05:22.271 --> 05:24.482
I read, I just don't read
what they give us at school.

05:25.358 --> 05:28.694
Do I really care who wins between
Beowulf & Grendel, no I don't.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.197
Maybe if I had a
little money on it.

05:32.490 --> 05:34.242
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

05:36.119 --> 05:38.617
No college reporters
won a Pulitzer, right?

05:38.932 --> 05:39.918
I do not think so.

05:39.318 --> 05:41.806
You are going to be fine, don't
put so much pressure on yourself.

05:41.806 --> 05:42.867
I think it's going to be great.

05:42.867 --> 05:45.211
Listen, I want to see the 
Weegee photos at MoMA,

05:45.211 --> 05:46.744
and I booked us a 
dinner at Daniel's.

05:47.194 --> 05:49.548
It's kind of a nice place, we can
dress up for it. It would be really nice.

05:49.548 --> 05:51.844
And I splurged on
the suite at the Pierre.

05:51.844 --> 05:54.639
What the hell, right? It's poker
winnings, it's not even real money.

06:07.902 --> 06:10.154
Gatsby, it's beautiful!

06:10.321 --> 06:12.114
I wanted to do something special.

06:13.866 --> 06:15.081
The flowers.

06:15.218 --> 06:17.863
- That's not me, I don't know what that is.
- Champagne.

06:20.037 --> 06:21.467
Look at that view.

06:21.467 --> 06:24.121
I wanted it to be high enough
so you could see Central Park.

06:25.562 --> 06:28.734
Central Park.
Exciting.

06:29.016 --> 06:31.769
Thank you so much, sir.
I really appreciate that.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.127
Thank you.

06:34.410 --> 06:36.325
Later maybe we could 
take a carriage ride?

06:36.325 --> 06:36.963
Yeah.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.096
If it doesn't rain.

06:38.096 --> 06:40.805
We could ride in the rain, it's very moody.
It's very romantic.

06:41.452 --> 06:42.578
 I prefer it.

06:43.328 --> 06:44.423
What time is it?

06:44.574 --> 06:46.129
Yeah we should go, 
this is hotel at downtown.

06:46.129 --> 06:47.466
It might be a 
little bit of a traffic.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.380
- It is far?
- It's in Soho.

06:49.874 --> 06:52.627
You are going to like Soho.
It's filled with creative people.

06:53.295 --> 06:56.590
Then it got commercially expensive, so all
the creative people moved to Tribeka.

06:57.048 --> 06:59.259
And that got expensive,
so they all moved to Brooklyn.

07:00.176 --> 07:02.012
Next move is back in
with their parents.

07:13.690 --> 07:15.161
He's only giving me an hour.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.268
It's good, we have a
01:30 lunch reservation.

07:18.239 --> 07:19.866
What are you going
to do while I'm upstairs?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.220
I do not know.

07:21.361 --> 07:23.663
Just roam around Soho, 
maybe visit my brother.

07:23.839 --> 07:25.924
I can't say how nice it is that
you're back in the city.

07:26.300 --> 07:29.633
If it weren't for you I don't know if I
would ever find my way back to Yardley.

07:29.633 --> 07:32.970
- What would you do?
- Find some brilliant way to ruin my life.

07:34.911 --> 07:37.831
Hi, I'm here for
Mr. Roland Pollard.

07:40.041 --> 07:42.565
Roland, this is Ashleigh
Enright from Yardley.

07:42.565 --> 07:43.921
- How do you do?
- Ashleigh, this is Roland.

07:44.681 --> 07:47.517
The screening is all set up.
We are running on a really tight schedule.

07:48.101 --> 07:52.355
First of all, I'd just like to say that
what an honor this is for me.

07:52.689 --> 07:56.651
I just want to say you're by far the most
interesting american director.

07:56.943 --> 07:57.861
Thank you.

07:59.321 --> 08:00.595
I write in the arts for a paper

08:00.595 --> 08:03.596
and I always put you right 
in the class with Renoir and De Sica.

08:04.929 --> 08:07.396
I'm surprised to hear that 
someone your age is

08:07.396 --> 08:09.157
familiar with 
Renoir and De Sica.

08:10.481 --> 08:14.284
Film is my total thing.
I've seen all the american classics.

08:14.284 --> 08:17.127
Particularly the europeans.
Kurosawa is my favourite.

08:19.163 --> 08:22.375
Technically, he is not european,
technically, he's, obviously, japanese.

08:22.542 --> 08:25.420
But you really 
speak to my soul.

08:27.672 --> 08:29.173
What college are you from?

08:29.519 --> 08:31.407
Yardley. It's small.

08:32.231 --> 08:34.359
I know it well, my first
wife went there.

08:34.859 --> 08:36.402
- Really?
- Yes.

08:37.779 --> 08:42.817
Brilliant woman, long blonde hair
and a state of the art overbite.

08:42.817 --> 08:45.007
Very sexy.
A philosophy major.

08:45.794 --> 08:47.803
To tell you the truth I
didn't deserve her, and

08:47.803 --> 08:50.411
I didn't end up with
her either, so ...

08:50.757 --> 08:53.449
Well, that's a...

08:54.829 --> 08:57.473
Neither, either, nor yawn.

08:57.473 --> 08:58.747
I imagine.

08:59.607 --> 09:04.111
I guess, it's probably
more yawn that either.

09:04.938 --> 09:06.194
Are you from New York?

09:07.107 --> 09:08.504
Tucson, Arizona.

09:09.699 --> 09:11.113
What does your family do?

09:11.549 --> 09:12.753
I was afraid you'd ask.

09:12.891 --> 09:14.108
My father owns banks.

09:14.414 --> 09:15.504
Is that bad?

09:16.712 --> 09:18.046
I know what you are thinking.

09:19.214 --> 09:23.093
"Republicans, the one percent".
But we are not.

09:24.428 --> 09:28.557
We're just, totally Episcopalians,
who happen to just be rich.

09:29.558 --> 09:30.976
That's how my Ashley was.

09:32.185 --> 09:33.616
Who's your Ashley?

09:34.201 --> 09:35.201
My first wife.

09:36.194 --> 09:39.489
The one with a long blonde hair
and a state of the art overbite.

09:40.865 --> 09:42.283
Her name was Ashley?

09:43.201 --> 09:44.869
A-S-H-L-E-Y.

09:47.706 --> 09:51.000
Mine is A-S-H-L-E-I-G-H.

09:51.668 --> 09:53.461
You use a Forbes 500 spelling.

09:56.381 --> 10:00.677
Since this is your first meaningful
assignment, would you like a scoop?

10:02.679 --> 10:03.555
Of?

10:06.599 --> 10:09.227
Inside information.
You've heard what the term is.

10:10.311 --> 10:11.312
Oh, a scoop!

10:12.605 --> 10:17.777
I'd rather share this with you, than
some slick gossip-hungry newspaper.

10:18.445 --> 10:19.571
Oh my God.

10:21.406 --> 10:26.077
You keep going, I'm liable to have my
famous psychological hiccup fits.

10:26.578 --> 10:28.037
When I'm nervous I stammer.

10:28.830 --> 10:29.831
Is this the scoop?

10:30.957 --> 10:32.500
No, that's not the scoop.

10:33.918 --> 10:36.296
The worst, of course, is
when I'm sexually conflicted.

10:37.338 --> 10:38.923
Then I'll hiccup indefinitely.

10:43.386 --> 10:44.612
The scoop is -

10:45.689 --> 10:47.614
I am not happy 
with this film.

10:48.625 --> 10:49.543
You're not?

10:50.110 --> 10:52.654
I am thinking of quitting, actually.

10:53.947 --> 10:54.865
That's the scoop.

10:58.327 --> 11:01.872
If I could speak
frankly, Mr. Pollard.

11:05.626 --> 11:07.540
You've never had mass appeal.

11:08.577 --> 11:10.070
You're too original.

11:10.682 --> 11:14.435
And you've never once made
one single commercial concession.

11:16.794 --> 11:18.420
You are a free creative spirit.

11:19.922 --> 11:25.594
Like Van Gogh, or
Rothko, or Virginia Woolf.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.849
Of course, they
all committed suicide.

11:31.809 --> 11:33.811
It's a very sweet
thing to say, actually.

11:34.937 --> 11:36.777
You should read me on you.

11:37.846 --> 11:39.921
I wrote that your 
best work is yet to come.

11:40.273 --> 11:45.194
It's only in, Yardley Argus,
but we have a good circulation.

11:45.374 --> 11:47.376
You think that my best
work is yet to come?

11:48.294 --> 11:49.170
I do.

11:49.921 --> 11:52.298
And I haven't seen your
new film, but I'm willing to bet...

11:52.465 --> 11:53.341
Would you like to?

11:55.051 --> 11:56.344
I'd love to.

11:57.094 --> 12:01.015
I know how secretive you are.
Which I, totally, respect.

12:02.016 --> 12:03.282
What are you doing now?

12:03.767 --> 12:04.371
Now?

12:04.371 --> 12:08.125
Yes now. I'm screening it
for Ted Davidoff, who did the script.

12:08.633 --> 12:12.929
I know who he is, he writes
all your movies, he's a genious.

12:13.096 --> 12:15.431
The screening has
some last minute changes.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.033
Face saving changes.

12:17.784 --> 12:18.868
How long does it run?

12:20.203 --> 12:22.330
I guess I could shift
my lunch plans.

12:24.081 --> 12:27.668
One thing about New York City -
you are here or you are nowhere.

12:27.835 --> 12:33.132
You cannot achieve this level of anxiety,
hostility and paranoia anywhere else.

12:33.299 --> 12:34.717
It's really exhilarating.

12:36.469 --> 12:39.952
Anyhow, I decided to treat 
myself to a cigarette holder,

12:39.952 --> 12:41.283
which makes me look dapper

12:41.283 --> 12:44.209
and serves the double duty 
of delaying the inevitable onset

12:44.209 --> 12:45.905
of cancer or emphysema.

12:46.359 --> 12:47.569
I smoke too much.

12:49.110 --> 12:51.914
So then who do I meet, 
but one of the most obnoxious

12:51.914 --> 12:54.289
and revolting characters 
from my high school.

12:54.911 --> 12:57.115
Welles?
Hey.

12:57.279 --> 12:58.224
Troller.

12:58.541 --> 13:00.446
I heard that you 
flanked out of freshman year.

13:01.060 --> 13:03.222
No, I didn't flunk out, 
I transferred up to Yardley,

13:03.222 --> 13:05.426
because the first place 
I tried was too unstructured.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.099
They word around is flunked.

13:08.261 --> 13:08.924
No.

13:09.512 --> 13:11.681
Where the hell is Yardley,
Afghanistan?

13:12.307 --> 13:13.422
Upstate.

13:13.722 --> 13:15.159
- Have you heard about Finletter?
- No.

13:15.436 --> 13:18.105
He got thrown out of Princeton
for passing bed checks.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.608
- No, I didn't hear about that.
- The big deal.

13:20.942 --> 13:23.778
Because of his father he's
got like the all-time golden parachute.

13:24.236 --> 13:27.239
He could commit mass murder and he'd
still have a cushy job waiting for him.

13:27.406 --> 13:30.910
- It's a weird way to put it.
- And Millstein is marrying Carol Durand.

13:31.243 --> 13:35.164
Which, I'll never understand,
because she resembles Yasser Arafat.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.583
Not to mention she's an Ice Queen.

13:38.167 --> 13:40.127
You can't believe everything.

13:40.461 --> 13:41.640
What are you doing in town?

13:41.916 --> 13:44.779
It's my girlfriend, I'm just showing 
her around for the weekend.

13:45.332 --> 13:47.376
- Who is your girlfriend?
- You wouldn't know her.

13:47.751 --> 13:49.211
But she's got a 
name, hasn't she?

13:50.879 --> 13:51.838
Ashleigh.

13:53.048 --> 13:55.951
Like Ashley Wilkes
in "Gone with the Wind"?

13:56.090 --> 13:57.106
That whimp.

13:58.286 --> 13:59.371
What about Josh Loomis?

13:59.538 --> 14:02.457
I just saw Josh.
He's shooting a movie at Minetta.

14:02.916 --> 14:05.002
- A movie?
- It's his student film.

14:05.919 --> 14:08.922
NYU project, it looked
completely stupid to me.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.714
You should stop by.

14:10.995 --> 14:13.348
He's with Evans 
and the younger Tyrell.

14:14.566 --> 14:17.778
You've always liked Josh.
That turned into a classic whimp.

14:19.821 --> 14:22.032
Did you say Amy's younger sister is there?
Is Amy there?

14:22.199 --> 14:26.078
Amy is at Vassar.
Big deal. I'm impressed.

14:27.329 --> 14:30.540
Flat-chested.
Like two dimes on a hanging board.

14:30.999 --> 14:34.586
- Amy was beautiful.
- Yeah, if you like Grace Kelly.

14:36.254 --> 14:37.297
What are you in town for?

14:37.631 --> 14:41.259
My girlfriend, she has an interview
with Roland Pollard for the school paper.

14:41.635 --> 14:42.636
Who's that?

14:43.095 --> 14:47.182
It's a director. He did
"Winter Memories", "Moonlight".

14:47.516 --> 14:49.851
Oh yeah! 
I can't stand his flicks.

14:50.894 --> 14:55.440
All that whimpy emotional probing,
and never a single decent toilet joke.

14:57.192 --> 14:59.929
You should go and watch them shoot.
You could be in it.

15:00.201 --> 15:01.907
They're looking for volunteers.

15:02.621 --> 15:05.999
With that cigarette holder you
could be the perfect milk toast nerd.

15:07.417 --> 15:08.960
I'm running a little bit late.

15:11.421 --> 15:14.508
I wouldn't trust my girl with
a big time Hollywood director.

15:15.467 --> 15:16.635
Good to know.

15:17.344 --> 15:19.763
- You didn't ask me what I am doing.
- What are you doing?

15:20.555 --> 15:21.878
I'm only pre-med.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.461
We have paw at 
the boarding of Grenada.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.363
I can't make lunch.

15:27.790 --> 15:28.889
What? Why not?

15:29.373 --> 15:31.459
- I have to see his film.
- You do?

15:32.334 --> 15:34.281
It's an unbelievable opportunity.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.909
And then we're going to 
discuss it after and everything.

15:36.909 --> 15:39.036
How did this develop?
I though you just had an hour with him.

15:39.203 --> 15:41.430
So did I, but then he 
started opening up to me.

15:41.430 --> 15:42.422
He did?

15:42.708 --> 15:45.079
He is going through 
this real artistic crisis.

15:45.514 --> 15:47.148
There's a real story here.

15:47.438 --> 15:48.898
We have a lunch reservation.

15:50.532 --> 15:53.254
You wouldn't want me to
say no to the screening?

15:53.694 --> 15:56.781
I am here for work.
We'll have plenty of time.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.211
When? The film's going
to take a couple of hours.

15:59.836 --> 16:00.795
I mean.

16:01.463 --> 16:04.258
It's 1 now, the movie 
will probably be over around 3

16:04.379 --> 16:06.070
and then I'll have all afternoon.

16:06.363 --> 16:07.948
How did you get friendly so fast?

16:09.866 --> 16:12.536
He's going through this
whole self-sabotage trip.

16:14.534 --> 16:15.709
It's a scoop.

16:16.357 --> 16:17.426
Is that him?

16:18.221 --> 16:19.221
Yes.

16:23.430 --> 16:25.015
He's a little older
looking than I thought.

16:26.725 --> 16:28.663
It's a good look though, 
don't you think?

16:28.927 --> 16:30.085
He is a sufferer.

16:30.399 --> 16:32.067
So what, what's so great 
about suffering?

16:33.026 --> 16:36.738
You should hear him talk
about the arts, he's so passionate.

16:37.573 --> 16:39.992
I can see how all of his leading
ladies fall in love with him.

16:40.784 --> 16:41.785
Do you want me 
to meet him?

16:42.953 --> 16:44.830
- I wouldn't want you to spook him.
- It's okay.

16:44.980 --> 16:48.150
No, he's a very private person.
And distraught.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.070
I'll see you later and
I'll meet you back at Carlyle at 3.

16:52.237 --> 16:54.197
It's the Pierre.
The Carlyle is tonight.

16:57.909 --> 17:01.621
What the hell is it about older guys
that seem so appealing to women.

17:02.372 --> 17:06.835
All they are is decrepit.
What is sexy about short-term memory loss?

17:07.752 --> 17:09.233
I never want to get old.

17:09.397 --> 17:12.230
Of course, with my smoking 
habit, I'll be spitting blood at 40.

17:13.910 --> 17:16.877
If she's going to get 
some big inside news story,

17:17.045 --> 17:19.214
she has to put in 
time with this guy.

17:19.778 --> 17:21.320
Meanwhile, it's going to rain soon.

17:23.406 --> 17:24.261
Gatsby!

17:24.916 --> 17:26.008
Josh.

17:27.019 --> 17:27.926
How are you man?

17:27.926 --> 17:29.549
- It's nice to see you.
- It's good to see you.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.091
I just ran into Alman Troller.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.939
He told me you were 
shooting a short film down here,

17:32.939 --> 17:34.318
I thought I'd stop 
by and say hi.

17:34.350 --> 17:36.903
It's just my mid-term project, 
it's nothing big actually.

17:37.042 --> 17:38.132
How's Yardley, 
is that where you are?

17:38.132 --> 17:39.926
It's okay, I'm not really 
liking it too much,

17:39.926 --> 17:41.718
I'd rather be going 
to school in the city, but...

17:41.846 --> 17:43.790
You know my mother. 
If it's not the perfect image,

17:43.790 --> 17:47.088
she bites down that cyanide capsule 
she keeps for special emergencies.

17:47.228 --> 17:48.429
I didn't know that.

17:48.587 --> 17:49.764
The only thing I remember 
about them is

17:49.764 --> 17:52.006
 that they had that 
fundraiser for Jeb Bush, right?

17:52.006 --> 17:53.423
- Right.
- Right.

17:55.249 --> 17:56.788
So listen, how are you? 
How's life?

17:57.373 --> 17:59.291
What's going on here? 
What are you doing here?

17:59.291 --> 18:02.336
You know, just out here trying
to create modern film-noir classic.

18:02.445 --> 18:03.638
Okay, alright.

18:03.638 --> 18:05.112
- Do you want to be in it?
- No.

18:05.434 --> 18:06.711
- Come on, man.
- No.

18:07.361 --> 18:10.102
We're just light on extras, we
have all those people who never showed.

18:10.102 --> 18:11.510
You wouldn't have
to talk or anything.

18:11.510 --> 18:12.937
Seriously, you just 
get in the car,

18:12.937 --> 18:15.010
and then on action you 
let the girl out, that's it.

18:15.041 --> 18:17.502
- Okay, I don't have to talk?
- None. Zero words.

18:18.668 --> 18:20.251
- I can handle that.
- Okay, there you go.

18:20.251 --> 18:21.590
You remember Chan, don't you?

18:22.467 --> 18:24.010
- Chan Tyrell.
- Hi.

18:24.761 --> 18:27.347
- You're Amy's little sister, right?
- Good to see you.

18:29.182 --> 18:30.892
- Should we do this?
- Yeah, go in there.

18:31.768 --> 18:33.728
I like that coat, actually,
no, keep that on.

18:33.895 --> 18:36.856
Listen, I hear your older
sister's at Vassar now, right?

18:37.565 --> 18:39.265
Yeah, political science major.

18:39.356 --> 18:40.179
Can you believe it?

18:40.179 --> 18:42.948
I mean Amy never heard 
the news that Lincoln was shot.

18:43.301 --> 18:45.097
Chan Tyrell.
This is insane.

18:45.208 --> 18:48.962
You were a little girl, and now
you are, actually, a young woman.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.715
You are not going to
start singing Gigi, are you?

18:52.055 --> 18:54.128
- I'm not going to start singing...
- So here's the story.

18:54.128 --> 18:56.608
She is totally mad with
loss and she can't let go off you.

18:57.576 --> 18:59.911
She kisses you and then
she bursts away.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.220
Chan Tyrell.

19:02.338 --> 19:05.049
Incidentally, I apologise in
advance for ruining your scene.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.944
- I'm not an actor.
- I'm not an actress either.

19:07.944 --> 19:09.448
I'm just helping out a friend.

19:09.740 --> 19:10.574
And we kiss?

19:11.116 --> 19:13.243
Yeah, that's why I never
wanted to be an actress.

19:13.410 --> 19:17.706
You have to fake passion
with all kinds of weirdos.

19:18.707 --> 19:20.459
- Thank you.
- Nevermind.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.837
Just kiss me so I can
really feel it in my toes.

19:24.087 --> 19:26.965
I used to kiss your older sister, did
she ever say anything about that or no?

19:27.216 --> 19:30.636
I don't know, I don't recall.
I think maybe she said you were a 4.

19:31.470 --> 19:34.181
- A 4? She said I was a 4?
- I don't know, maybe a 6.

19:34.348 --> 19:39.186
Maybe a 6, I can't recall.
Just this kiss, I want it to be hot.

19:39.978 --> 19:42.189
If we are going to do it,
let's do it right.

19:42.814 --> 19:44.483
- Good work ethic.
- Thank you.

19:46.777 --> 19:47.611
Action.

19:56.119 --> 19:57.037
Cut.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.831
Are you going to
keep your mouth closed?

20:00.874 --> 20:03.181
I have a girlfriend, Chan.
I don't think I can do this.

20:03.791 --> 20:05.347
I'm sorry, I think I froze.

20:05.808 --> 20:07.935
You have a girlfriend?
Who's your girlfriend?

20:08.144 --> 20:09.986
Her name is Ashleigh, 
she's from Yardley.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.790
She's from Tuscon originally.

20:11.790 --> 20:14.514
Tuscon? You are dating 
a girl from Arizona?

20:14.674 --> 20:15.828
Do I have your permission?

20:15.970 --> 20:17.711
What do you guys 
talk about, cactuses?

20:18.020 --> 20:19.104
Rattlesnakes.

20:20.379 --> 20:23.272
Arizona? That would be 
great for your asthma.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.221
I don't have asthma.

20:26.295 --> 20:29.006
When we were kissing, I
thought I heard you wheezing.

20:29.233 --> 20:31.925
I always remembered
you as a very snotty kid.

20:33.376 --> 20:34.251
Ready?

20:35.002 --> 20:36.545
What are you up to now?

20:36.796 --> 20:39.924
- I am studying design at a fashion Institute.
- That's unique.

20:40.216 --> 20:41.133
Rolling.

20:42.301 --> 20:43.928
Scene 19, take 2.

20:45.054 --> 20:46.013
Action.

20:51.018 --> 20:53.104
Cut.
That's better.

20:53.354 --> 20:55.835
Josh, he's way too uptight 
to open up his mouth.

20:55.974 --> 20:57.268
Are you still 
seeing that shrink?

20:57.268 --> 20:59.158
Give me a break, alright?
I was just taking a walk.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.956
He asked me to help out, alright? 
I've never acted before.

21:02.654 --> 21:05.282
- Scene 19, take 3.
- Action.

21:10.248 --> 21:11.874
Josh, it's starting to rain.

21:16.879 --> 21:18.840
And cut. Great.

21:20.091 --> 21:23.136
See, I knew you could do it.
And I won't tell your girlfriend.

21:23.928 --> 21:25.517
Josh, you like it, you 
want a different version?

21:25.517 --> 21:27.121
- I can...
- No, we go with that version.

21:27.121 --> 21:28.576
That's the version, 
we're sticking with that.

21:28.576 --> 21:30.136
Alright, well, have 
fun in Arizona.

21:30.280 --> 21:33.451
And whatever you do, don't 
get lost in a desert and die of thirst.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.127
I'll be sure to 
bring a canteen.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.005
Don't fall in the Grand Canyon
too, it's really deep.

21:47.471 --> 21:49.840
She's always been the 
pain in the ass, kid sister.

21:49.964 --> 21:51.087
How could she not be?

21:51.087 --> 21:53.923
Amy was gorgeous, and so
sexually advanced.

21:54.257 --> 21:57.176
Word on Amy was she performed
an oral sex at the bar mitzvah.

21:57.635 --> 21:59.784
Maybe they should make that 
a part of every jewish holiday.

21:59.784 --> 22:01.288
Certainly beats fasting.

22:01.438 --> 22:05.025
It's also a great way to celebrate the
Jewish New Year, what a great Hanukah gift.

22:07.777 --> 22:09.500
I wonder what's 
been bothering Hunter.

22:09.646 --> 22:12.385
Something was definitely 
on his mind when I called him.

22:18.548 --> 22:20.383
- Gatsby!
- Surprise.

22:20.550 --> 22:23.678
- I told you I might drop in.
- That's crazy!

22:23.845 --> 22:25.305
Listen, if you have something
to do I can come back...

22:25.472 --> 22:28.141
- No, I have nothing to do.
- Good to see you.

22:28.516 --> 22:29.669
How are you?

22:30.531 --> 22:33.242
- I'm good, you?
- Good.

22:33.409 --> 22:35.270
Are you coming 
for Mom's party?

22:35.270 --> 22:37.347
No, you can't tell 
her I'm here, okay?

22:38.122 --> 22:39.717
It's okay, Hunter, 
you can pull it off.

22:39.717 --> 22:41.335
You are engaged and 
not in the house now,

22:41.335 --> 22:43.115
she's not going to 
take your phone away.

22:43.787 --> 22:46.423
- If Mom finds out she'll die.
- No, she won't, she'll live.

22:46.423 --> 22:47.648
And she's not going to find out.

22:47.947 --> 22:48.990
Well, count me in.

22:49.156 --> 22:52.349
It's Ashleigh, my girlfriend, she has
to do an interview with Roland Pollard,

22:52.349 --> 22:54.079
the film director 
for the school paper.

22:54.523 --> 22:55.252
It's a big coup.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.593
Ashleigh? 
Someone the mom's high on?

22:57.722 --> 23:00.182
- She's never even met her.
- Hunter, your parents want to ...

23:01.183 --> 23:04.729
- Gatsby, It's so good to see you!
- It's good to see you, how are you?

23:05.229 --> 23:06.772
I'm good, what are 
you doing in town?

23:06.772 --> 23:09.340
His girlfriend is 
interviewing Roland ...

23:09.623 --> 23:11.102
Pollard, the film director, but,

23:11.102 --> 23:14.172
do me a favor don't tell my mom
I'm here, it's going to be a big party ...

23:14.172 --> 23:16.364
He hates parties, Mr. Anti-social.

23:17.046 --> 23:19.841
You always hated 
Mom's literary salons.

23:19.886 --> 23:23.306
It's rich housewifes who have
the leisure to pursue esoteric culture.

23:23.473 --> 23:25.391
The out of work,
discussing the out of print.

23:25.558 --> 23:28.895
She just wanted to make sure
that we are exposed to great literature.

23:29.061 --> 23:31.534
What about Jimmy Cannon then?
Or what Tom Adair?

23:31.534 --> 23:33.695
It's not all giant insects
and model maids.

23:33.783 --> 23:36.473
You are not going to 
duck out of our wedding, huh?

23:36.473 --> 23:38.118
How can he? 
He's the best man.

23:38.557 --> 23:39.969
He cries at weddings.

23:40.109 --> 23:44.052
He's not as tough as he makes out.
He cries at weddings and funerals.

23:44.352 --> 23:45.228
Same reason.

23:46.235 --> 23:49.280
I'm going to go take a shower.
But there's coffee.

23:49.463 --> 23:51.840
- I'm so glad you're here.
- It's nice being here.

23:54.051 --> 23:55.374
I've always liked her.

23:55.513 --> 23:56.431
Gatsby.

23:57.882 --> 23:59.349
- What's the matter?
- Gatsby.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.868
I don't want to go
through with this wedding.

24:02.868 --> 24:03.805
What?

24:03.956 --> 24:04.971
I can't do it.

24:05.524 --> 24:07.712
I can't, and I can't 
pull out now.

24:07.712 --> 24:10.548
It would kill her, it's two hundred
guests invited, they booked ...

24:11.394 --> 24:13.549
the Century Club, they 
booked an orchestra!

24:13.549 --> 24:14.699
God, save me!

24:15.392 --> 24:17.727
Okay, alright.
What happened?

24:18.386 --> 24:19.469
You'll think I'm so stupid.

24:19.469 --> 24:21.508
I'm not going to think you're stupid,
just tell me what happened?

24:21.508 --> 24:22.949
I can't, it's too stupid.

24:23.084 --> 24:25.836
You're making me anxious, I want to hear
this fascinating piece of stupidity.

24:26.003 --> 24:27.546
She's ... bright.

24:28.547 --> 24:31.000
Gatsby, she's nice, she's kind.

24:31.145 --> 24:31.852
So?

24:32.457 --> 24:34.214
I can't stand the way she laughs.

24:35.179 --> 24:35.585
What?

24:35.585 --> 24:37.065
Yeah, I can't take her laugh.

24:37.682 --> 24:38.933
- Her laugh?
- Yes.

24:39.243 --> 24:40.661
Yeah, her laugh.

24:40.827 --> 24:43.330
Hunter, that's probably the most
idiotic thing I've heard in my life.

24:43.497 --> 24:44.998
I told you'd think it's stupid.

24:45.487 --> 24:46.706
What's wrong with her laugh?

24:46.706 --> 24:48.438
Listen to it, it's 
a total turn-off.

24:49.270 --> 24:50.271
How much do you love her?

24:50.438 --> 24:53.117
I do, I love her, I love 
her, it's just her laugh.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.582
If you love her 
then get over it.

24:54.582 --> 24:56.532
I can't. I've tried.
I've tried.

24:57.556 --> 25:00.297
Last night, we were talking 
in bed and she laughed

25:00.421 --> 25:02.486
and I couldn't 
make love to her.

25:03.030 --> 25:05.324
- What?
- I couldn't, I was impotent.

25:05.449 --> 25:06.366
From her laugh?

25:07.034 --> 25:08.994
- It's happened before.
- Hunter, you have to see a shrink.

25:09.828 --> 25:11.138
- I'm serious.
- I don't need a shrink.

25:11.138 --> 25:13.514
I know what the problem
is - she has a fatal laugh.

25:14.847 --> 25:19.893
A cross between Dad's sister Betty
and Lennie in "Of Mice and Men".

25:22.020 --> 25:23.814
I've never heard of a
problem like that before.

25:23.981 --> 25:24.952
You are young, Gatsby.

25:24.952 --> 25:27.549
The world is full of 
tragic little dealbreakers.

25:27.549 --> 25:29.450
Haven't you been 
seeing Lily for over a year?

25:29.590 --> 25:30.765
Why is this coming up now?

25:31.465 --> 25:32.549
Have you talked 
to her about it?

25:34.134 --> 25:36.121
I brought it up, tactfully, but

25:36.425 --> 25:38.738
I don't think she realises 
how serious it's gotten.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.074
I love her, but I can't 
marry her, Gatsby.

25:42.658 --> 25:44.211
I won't be able to 
have sex with her.

25:44.211 --> 25:45.598
No, you mean you 
don't want to marry her

25:45.598 --> 25:47.737
so you're focusing 
on this laugh insanity?

25:47.876 --> 25:51.388
Spare me the fruits of your Upper East
Side talking, listen to her laugh.

25:51.388 --> 25:53.548
When she comes down, 
we'll get her to laugh.

25:53.713 --> 25:55.128
You'll see what I mean.

26:02.024 --> 26:02.941
I can't.

26:03.567 --> 26:05.227
- I can't do this, I'm sorry.
- Rollie.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.244
I know, I'm sorry, Ted.

26:07.244 --> 26:08.741
- Rollie, come on.
- It's actually, it's physcially...

26:08.741 --> 26:10.129
- Don't do this.
- making me sick.

26:10.155 --> 26:11.103
Don't do this.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.641
- It's humiliating.
- It's a process, Rollie.

26:12.923 --> 26:14.781
- Your changes are shit.
- Rollie, sit down.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.632
- Everything that I did is shit.
- Not shit, different, different.

26:16.716 --> 26:17.267
Mr. Pollard.

26:17.364 --> 26:19.823
- It's not different.
- Not all the changes work, but some are good.

26:19.823 --> 26:21.480
Thank you for coming, Ashleigh,
I need to get a little air.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.480
- It's a process.
- I need some space.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.625
- Come and sit down.
- I need to get out.

26:23.649 --> 26:24.182
Don't do this.

26:24.182 --> 26:26.935
- I need to think about.
- Don't! No booze.

26:27.477 --> 26:28.687
- Please, no booze.
- What?

26:28.885 --> 26:29.885
Come on.

26:31.701 --> 26:35.802
You just watched 2 hours of
an existential steaming shit pile

26:35.802 --> 26:37.393
and that's all that
you can say to me?

26:37.393 --> 26:39.981
- It's a process, we do this every time.
- Ted, Ted.

26:39.981 --> 26:42.518
Rollie, come on, back.
Don't drink.

26:42.750 --> 26:43.277
Oh, God.

26:43.277 --> 26:46.071
- Shouldn't we go afer him?
- That's the sure sign he is going to drink.

26:46.475 --> 26:47.993
You go, you can go.

26:48.142 --> 26:49.519
I have to watch it all

26:49.808 --> 26:51.900
to be able to talk 
to him intelligently about it.

26:53.462 --> 26:55.005
I love the movie so far.

26:56.340 --> 26:57.883
- You do?
- I do.

27:00.844 --> 27:01.762
Let's go back.

27:03.515 --> 27:06.247
There's a high-stakes card
game later at a Fremont Hotel.

27:06.247 --> 27:08.643
I can't make it, but I know
you love that kind of thing.

27:08.643 --> 27:11.450
You want me to call Joe Cohen,
and say you'll take my chair?

27:11.450 --> 27:14.996
I would love a high-stakes card game,
I'm loaded right now, but

27:15.108 --> 27:17.113
Ashleigh and I, we
have plans for tonight.

27:17.113 --> 27:18.378
I'm dying to meet Ashleigh.

27:18.378 --> 27:20.654
I know, I don't know 
where she is right now.

27:21.216 --> 27:24.114
- I was supposed to show her city today.
- You better take an umbrella.

27:24.402 --> 27:25.695
Watch, I'll make her laugh.

27:26.613 --> 27:30.116
I was just telling Gatsby...
Larry Nash told me a great joke.

27:30.283 --> 27:33.173
Two cannibals are eating
a comedian and one says:

27:33.280 --> 27:34.973
 "Hey, do you taste 
something funny?"

27:35.404 --> 27:37.363
That is so ufunny.

27:37.447 --> 27:41.277
Okay, that's my que, Hunter,
lovely to see you as always.

27:41.277 --> 27:42.611
Lily, thank you 
for the coffee.

27:42.868 --> 27:43.991
- I heard one more.
- Sure.

27:44.010 --> 27:46.530
A homeless man stopped a Jewish
mother on the street and said:

27:46.530 --> 27:50.325
"Lady, I haven't eaten in 3 days.
And she said: "Force yourself".

28:11.354 --> 28:12.790
Hello, Ashleigh, what's going on?

28:12.790 --> 28:14.953
You said you were going 
to call me 30 minutes ago.

28:15.251 --> 28:19.046
I know, but the film got delayed.
I'm up at this screening room place.

28:19.994 --> 28:23.005
It's fine, just meet me at the
Museum of Modern Art on 53rd Street.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.806
We'll grab a bite to eat there and
then we are going to go see the Weegee's.

28:25.806 --> 28:28.517
- I can't. I can't.
- What do yo mean, why not?

28:28.597 --> 28:30.432
Because I'm onto a 
real story here.

28:30.932 --> 28:34.936
This is a 70 million dollar movie
and Rollie is very unhappy with it.

28:35.937 --> 28:37.147
You call him Rollie?

28:37.731 --> 28:39.310
Yeah, and Ted and I, 
we have to find him.

28:39.310 --> 28:40.688
We have to find 
him and talk with him.

28:40.688 --> 28:44.066
Before he adds one of his crazy fits,
and then re-edits the whole thing and ruins it.

28:44.683 --> 28:45.600
Who is Ted?

28:46.309 --> 28:49.562
Gatsby, I can't talk right now.
But I'll call you as soon as I'm through.

28:50.605 --> 28:53.441
And if I'm running late, I'll
just meet you back at the Plaza.

28:54.401 --> 28:56.299
It's not the Plaz...
It's the Carlyle!

28:56.589 --> 28:58.989
It's a bar and the
piano for tonight.

29:00.203 --> 29:04.291
He's not at the hotel and he didn't show
up for the press interview, so

29:04.406 --> 29:07.719
he's wallowing in self-loathing
somehere, drinking Courvoisier,

29:07.719 --> 29:09.987
thinking of new ways
to screw up our work.

29:10.176 --> 29:12.224
I thought the film was 
full of wonderful things.

29:12.372 --> 29:14.033
Me too. Tell him, you ...
Tell him, tell Roland.

29:14.033 --> 29:16.300
Because hearing that from
me won't mean anything.

29:16.300 --> 29:19.582
I'm always at this end of the
argument, but you are fresh,

29:19.582 --> 29:21.546
honest, new generation woman.

29:21.681 --> 29:23.989
Especially a pretty one, maybe ...
You may...

29:24.113 --> 29:25.941
Come on, let's find him.
Are you okay?

29:25.941 --> 29:27.438
- Yeah.
- Come on.

29:28.833 --> 29:33.129
He doesn't like her laugh?
No, Ashleigh's laugh is perfect.

29:33.797 --> 29:37.676
Let's go, Ashleigh, we're blowing
the day and it's so moody out.

29:38.009 --> 29:39.171
We could be on a ferry,

29:39.419 --> 29:42.814
or the top of the Empire 
State Building, black and white.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.783
- Yeah, he was here.
- He was here?

29:45.950 --> 29:48.683
He seemed very distraught.
He knocked back a couple of brandies.

29:48.683 --> 29:50.824
Mumbled something about
heading out to the studio.

29:52.123 --> 29:55.418
Okay. Let's take my car
and head out to Queens.

29:55.738 --> 29:57.852
- Queens?
- Yeah, it's a big film studio.

29:57.852 --> 29:59.071
Do you still want to come?

29:59.378 --> 30:00.608
Definitely.

30:00.608 --> 30:02.753
When Rollie gets
drunk and morose,

30:02.753 --> 30:04.474
he likes to wander 
around the sound stages

30:04.474 --> 30:06.209
 and pretend he's 
Norma Desmond.

30:06.353 --> 30:07.777
- Thanks.
- Sure.

30:17.350 --> 30:20.703
Can I ask you a few questions?
Since I am on assignment.

30:20.703 --> 30:22.152
Sure.

30:22.308 --> 30:24.517
What's your favorite 
film of Rollie's?

30:25.389 --> 30:27.767
"Winter Memories", 
the one in Venice.

30:28.392 --> 30:29.518
When did you first see it?

30:30.728 --> 30:34.690
It's with Gatsby, actually, it
was on our very first date.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.503
Dialogue made 
me want to kiss him.

30:38.254 --> 30:41.466
That line about love and death,
being two sides of the same coin.

30:42.842 --> 30:43.843
Did you understand it?

30:46.512 --> 30:47.430
No.

30:48.056 --> 30:51.684
I got confused, and felt insecure.

30:52.393 --> 30:55.021
Like I wanted to, just,
be held and kissed.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.325
Have you ever been to Venice?

30:58.492 --> 31:00.277
No, but Gatsby has.

31:01.746 --> 31:03.289
- Oh my God!
- What?

31:03.873 --> 31:06.375
I knew it!
I knew it!

31:06.751 --> 31:08.856
- Are you okay?
- Oh God!

31:08.856 --> 31:10.272
You turned all white.

31:10.465 --> 31:11.883
I knew it!
She was lying!

31:12.175 --> 31:13.551
- Who?
- Connie, my wife!

31:13.718 --> 31:16.262
- She's seeing Lipszyc!
- Who's Lipszyc?

31:16.429 --> 31:19.515
She said she was going shopping
with her sister, in Connecticut.

31:19.682 --> 31:22.143
But she's walking into
Lipszyc's building!

31:22.518 --> 31:23.944
Is Lipszyc a spy?

31:24.253 --> 31:24.867
What?

31:25.008 --> 31:28.095
No, Larry Lipszyc.
My friend, my best friend.

31:28.368 --> 31:30.249
My best friend. I can't believe it.
She must...

31:30.563 --> 31:32.106
They're having an affair.

31:32.279 --> 31:36.533
Oh God, are you okay?
You are clutching your heart.

31:36.918 --> 31:38.625
Okay, here's what we do.

31:38.625 --> 31:42.758
We sit here, we wait until she
comes out, and then I'll confront her.

31:44.170 --> 31:47.408
I hope there's not a gun in here
in glove compartment, like in your movies.

31:48.385 --> 31:49.678
You better go.
You go.

31:49.845 --> 31:52.765
No, I can't leave you alone.
You are all white and shaky.

31:53.807 --> 31:57.019
Breathe. Deeply breathe.

31:57.644 --> 32:00.021
Deeply. Dr. Ross said breathe.

32:00.814 --> 32:03.567
Deeply. Breathe deeply.

32:07.612 --> 32:09.072
No, not you.
Me.

32:10.175 --> 32:11.474
Oh God.

32:12.282 --> 32:13.438
Taxi!

32:14.852 --> 32:15.858
Taxi!

32:23.992 --> 32:25.730
Oh my God, Chan.
What are you doing here?

32:25.730 --> 32:26.833
What the hell, 
you were shooting ...

32:26.833 --> 32:28.458
- Hey, you take it, I'm getting out of this one.
- No, no, no, get in, Gatsby.

32:28.458 --> 32:29.823
- Are you sure?
- I'll drop you.

32:29.823 --> 32:33.228
-  Hey, where are you going?
- You remember, the same 5th Avenue joint.

32:33.930 --> 32:36.307
I remember your appartment
well for my days with Amy.

32:36.474 --> 32:40.228
I remember you calling for her,
my parents kept warning her about you.

32:40.394 --> 32:41.854
Warning? Why the hell
would they be warning her?

32:42.275 --> 32:44.779
Because on the first date 
you took her walking in the rain

32:44.901 --> 32:46.584
and she got bronchial pneumonia.

32:46.728 --> 32:48.205
For Christ's sake, I'm never
going to get over this.

32:48.205 --> 32:49.983
You can't get it
from being wet!

32:49.983 --> 32:51.944
Don't yell at me.
I thought it was romantic.

32:52.021 --> 32:52.986
That's because it is romantic.

32:52.986 --> 32:55.708
- It's a romatic gesture.
- That's what I'm saying.

32:55.708 --> 32:57.627
You should tell that to Ashleigh.
She thinks I'm nuts.

32:58.153 --> 33:00.655
Who's Ashleigh?
That rodeo queen you're dating?

33:01.156 --> 33:04.325
She's not a cowgirl, she comes from one of
the biggest banking families in Tuscon.

33:04.576 --> 33:06.755
She was a dead butone, actually.
She came out.

33:06.755 --> 33:08.253
She came out?
Is she gay?

33:08.455 --> 33:11.149
No, she's not gay, she's 
charming and beautiful.

33:11.149 --> 33:12.436
And we were 
supposed to have this...

33:12.591 --> 33:15.069
Goddamn weekend in the city
together, and suddenly she's...

33:15.500 --> 33:18.196
Parked down with all these 
interviews for the school paper.

33:18.196 --> 33:20.448
She's ambitious, you should
find that admirable.

33:21.738 --> 33:26.243
One, it was supposed to be one little ...
One tiny little, lousy, hour intervew.

33:26.410 --> 33:29.788
Instead, you know.
Lost the whole, goddamn, weekend.

33:30.664 --> 33:31.865
Would you just relax?

33:31.865 --> 33:34.643
- I don't really know why?
- I'm having a hard time relaxing, Chan.

33:34.643 --> 33:37.163
Because this was going
to be a special weekend.

33:37.172 --> 33:38.943
Instead I'm out here in a ...

33:38.943 --> 33:41.738
Wandering streets, like Hagar
in a goddamn desert or something.

33:41.847 --> 33:45.055
Don't tell me, tell her.
Tell her to get her priorities straight.

33:45.055 --> 33:48.266
You want to drink some wine, walk in
the rain and give her bronchitis.

33:50.251 --> 33:53.026
Okay, look she's, apparently,
onto a very big story.

33:53.026 --> 33:54.929
She takes her job
very seriously, alright?

33:54.929 --> 33:56.097
Fine, then get over it.

33:58.167 --> 33:59.668
I'm in the process of
getting over it.

33:59.985 --> 34:02.130
Unless you are worried
somebody's hitting on her.

34:02.130 --> 34:03.892
- What the hell does that mean?
- I don't know.

34:03.892 --> 34:06.491
Is she interviewing attractive men?

34:07.318 --> 34:09.382
I've never really thought about it.
I don't know.

34:10.054 --> 34:12.003
Some might say they are interesting.

34:12.630 --> 34:15.493
Then maybe you better
step in and assert yourself.

34:15.668 --> 34:18.197
- Do you think I have to be more demanding?
- I would.

34:19.587 --> 34:22.215
These are like movie big
shots she's hanging out with.

34:22.547 --> 34:24.926
- Suits?
- Yes, a director and a screenwriter.

34:25.342 --> 34:28.137
Artists, they are usually passionate.

34:28.679 --> 34:30.139
Oh, Jesus Christ!

34:31.556 --> 34:33.708
Okay, you're right,
I have to call her now.

34:34.413 --> 34:35.719
The sooner the better.

34:35.719 --> 34:37.512
- You think there's that much of a rush?
- I don't know.

34:38.304 --> 34:39.639
Oh, Christ, alright.

34:40.514 --> 34:41.732
It's your idea.

34:43.188 --> 34:44.543
What do you think I should say?

34:45.112 --> 34:47.114
- There's nothing you can say.
- What do you mean?

34:47.127 --> 34:48.962
Without sounding possessive.

34:49.379 --> 34:51.272
Christ, Chan, you just 
encouraged me to call her.

34:51.373 --> 34:52.357
Now I'm asking for your help

34:52.357 --> 34:54.148
and you are telling me
there's nothing I can say?

34:54.324 --> 34:56.126
You are so wishy washy.

34:56.317 --> 34:59.913
Now that I see your M-O I
know exatly why Amy 86ed you.

34:59.913 --> 35:00.957
No.

35:00.957 --> 35:03.412
Amy didn't dump me,
I got sick of seeing her.

35:03.412 --> 35:06.383
Yeah, because everytime you'd call,
and I'd say it was you on the phone,

35:06.383 --> 35:08.898
she'd wave her arms and
say "I'm not in, I'm not in".

35:09.925 --> 35:11.051
Hey, Gatsby?

35:11.659 --> 35:13.744
Hey, Ashleigh.
Listen.

35:14.655 --> 35:17.661
Look, I know you are very busy, and
that's why we came to New York, right?

35:18.223 --> 35:20.934
And no one has more respect
for honest ambitions than I do.

35:21.468 --> 35:24.221
Do I have to listen to this
without an airsick bag?

35:24.511 --> 35:28.224
I can't talk to you right now.
I'm kind of involved in the situation.

35:28.891 --> 35:30.726
We have a number of
things planned for today.

35:31.352 --> 35:33.113
I'm very busy right now.

35:33.371 --> 35:35.613
But, I really, I can't explain 
it over the phone.

35:35.912 --> 35:37.914
Ashleigh, we were talking
about one movie interview.

35:38.081 --> 35:40.231
What could possible be so
secretive about that?

35:40.504 --> 35:41.699
What's so CIA?

35:41.699 --> 35:45.590
Unless there's some
funny business going on?

35:46.546 --> 35:48.631
I'll talk to you later.
Bye, Gatsby.

35:51.216 --> 35:53.306
Oh, these, goddamn, 
cellphones are ...

35:53.582 --> 35:56.062
I don't know, to me it sounds
dubious to the max.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.532
It sounds dubious to you
because you have sinister mind.

35:59.468 --> 36:02.847
- You must really love her.
- I do, she's a breath of fresh air.

36:03.848 --> 36:07.101
She's charming and delightful.
She's pretty.

36:07.726 --> 36:10.187
She's sexy and somehow
at the same she's witty.

36:11.689 --> 36:13.524
She sings very nicely.
She plays the flute.

36:13.717 --> 36:15.368
I don't know how to 
break this to you.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.664
But I'm sick of 
hearing about her, okay?

36:20.240 --> 36:21.283
Was that your boyfriend?

36:22.576 --> 36:23.911
Gatsby.
Yeah.

36:25.079 --> 36:27.122
- Are you still dizzy?
- No, I'm okay.

36:29.333 --> 36:31.043
What's Gatsby do?

36:31.919 --> 36:33.545
He goes to Yardley too.

36:34.296 --> 36:36.924
Which he refers to as 
"Forced law on University."

36:37.841 --> 36:39.176
Is he a journalist too?

36:40.052 --> 36:42.179
He's not really 
focused professionally.

36:42.805 --> 36:46.600
I think that in his wildest dreams
he'd like to be Sky Masterson.

36:46.934 --> 36:50.020
- A Broadway bookie?
- He's a little eccentric.

36:50.687 --> 36:52.398
In what way?
Eccentric?

36:54.650 --> 36:58.737
I think it has to do with the fact that
he and his mom never really hit it off.

36:59.822 --> 37:03.992
She was always forcing him to
read everything, and learn piano...

37:04.907 --> 37:06.471
He is really smart.

37:06.471 --> 37:07.948
He was one of those 
students who...

37:07.948 --> 37:11.353
He doesn't have to study for a
test and then he just aces it.

37:11.353 --> 37:12.271
Sounds like me.

37:13.730 --> 37:14.898
To tell you the truth.

37:16.051 --> 37:20.828
Don't tell anybody, but I think
he has a touch of Asperger's.

37:25.339 --> 37:26.482
- You know what Chan?
- Yeah?

37:26.591 --> 37:28.146
I'm going to get out of here too.

37:31.429 --> 37:32.972
- What are you doing now?
- Why?

37:33.431 --> 37:35.429
Why, because I have a
little bit of time to kill.

37:35.684 --> 37:37.198
And I thought about 
going to Modern Museum.

37:37.198 --> 37:38.404
Look at the WeeGee exhibit.

37:38.404 --> 37:41.907
Oh, I see. You have nothing better to
do so you want me to keep you company?

37:41.958 --> 37:44.008
You know what? Forget it.
I dated your older sister.

37:44.008 --> 37:46.157
You've always had a little
bit of an attitude, okay?

37:46.157 --> 37:47.320
I'm not looking for any trouble.

37:47.320 --> 37:50.017
I have to check out some paintings
at the Mat's Profession Class.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.768
If you want to
keep me company.

37:51.768 --> 37:53.805
I don't know why 
you couldn't have just...

37:53.805 --> 37:55.107
Fine, it's going to be fun.

37:55.107 --> 37:56.331
We can get on
each other's nervs.

37:56.331 --> 37:58.375
Alright, let me change, I'm soaked.
Are you hungry?

37:58.542 --> 38:01.420
I'd give you an Arizona lunch,
but we are all out of beef jerky.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.495
Brings back a lot of memories.

38:09.912 --> 38:12.243
My folks are in East
Hampton for the weekend.

38:12.243 --> 38:13.207
How come you didn't go?

38:13.207 --> 38:14.635
I've got a date tonight.

38:14.944 --> 38:15.824
You?

38:15.824 --> 38:18.285
Don't be startled,
it turnes out I'm desirable.

38:18.452 --> 38:20.537
Who's the unfortunate victim?

38:20.704 --> 38:24.458
You wouldn't know him,
he's a girlfriend's dermatologist.

38:25.125 --> 38:26.001
It's romantic.

38:26.752 --> 38:30.296
Don't forget to show him those three
irregular black moles on your back.

38:30.515 --> 38:31.645
I'm sure they're nothing.

38:31.645 --> 38:34.279
I really hope I won't regret
not going to the Hamilton's.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.500
The beach is so pretty
in the rain too.

38:36.913 --> 38:39.791
- Would you have to be with your parents.
- So what? I love my parents.

38:40.040 --> 38:43.001
You know them, they are fun.
Don't you have fun with your parents?

38:43.259 --> 38:45.467
No, fun is not the 
word I would use.

38:45.593 --> 38:46.746
Alright, I'll be right back.

38:46.746 --> 38:50.083
- Hey, listen, can I play your piano?
- Yeah, go ahead, it's a family heirloom.

I love a "cocktail lounge" piano.

41:09.838 --> 41:12.132
Outside it drizzles, grey.

41:12.758 --> 41:15.813
New York City, enveloped
in the light mist.

41:16.481 --> 41:19.150
Two lovers have a date
to meet at 6 o'clock.

41:19.525 --> 41:23.071
At Grand Central Station, under
the clock, like in the movie.

41:23.312 --> 41:26.649
I love that movie,
but I see it outside.

41:28.359 --> 41:31.218
At the East River?
With the tugboats around the water?

41:31.218 --> 41:34.326
- I love tugboats.
- Almost, you're in the Rainbow Park.

41:36.010 --> 41:38.554
I know! I know!
Under the clock.

41:40.404 --> 41:41.321
Which clock?

41:41.613 --> 41:45.325
The Delacorte clock, where all the
animals go around in Central Park.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.514
I love it, it's very old movie.

41:48.098 --> 41:51.059
My Mom and I used to watch
old movies together all the time.

41:51.309 --> 41:55.731
She would study the decor.
They are so fabulously escapist.

41:56.773 --> 42:00.700
In my version he's
waiting, the music plays.

42:01.005 --> 42:03.072
And she never comes.

42:03.189 --> 42:06.150
Or she's waiting and he
chooses the other woman.

42:07.099 --> 42:08.615
Can't they just kiss in the rain?

42:08.615 --> 42:11.376
That sounds pretty good
to me, even if it is commercial.

42:12.380 --> 42:13.781
- Picture yourself.
- Okay.

42:13.922 --> 42:15.055
It's four minutes to six.

42:15.380 --> 42:18.800
You're pacing up and down,
rain drops have just started to fall.

42:19.634 --> 42:22.136
You're at your Delacorte clock
in Central Park.

42:22.762 --> 42:25.261
Expecting your ...

42:26.137 --> 42:27.370
Dermatologist.

42:27.487 --> 42:30.712
But he just diagnosed a
carcinoma in his own limp.

42:30.712 --> 42:32.714
It's metastasizing as you wait.

42:33.387 --> 42:37.391
Would you give me a break?
In my version, everything's fine.

42:37.558 --> 42:40.936
He meets me, holds me,
kisses me.

42:41.353 --> 42:43.689
It's lovely.
Nobody needs a biopsy.

42:47.443 --> 42:48.319
Connie!

42:48.821 --> 42:50.009
- Connie!
- Ted.

42:50.009 --> 42:53.095
Is this how you are shopping 
with Judy in Connecticut?

42:53.222 --> 42:54.223
What are you doing here?

42:54.390 --> 42:57.059
I happen to see you out
the window, from the car.

42:57.477 --> 42:58.516
By sheer chance.

42:58.912 --> 43:01.539
- Really? That's awkward, isn't it?
- Awkward, awkward?

43:02.121 --> 43:04.288
You've been sleeping with
him for months, haven't you?

43:04.288 --> 43:05.921
- We were going to tell you.
- When?

43:06.639 --> 43:08.686
- When we moved to London?
- No.

43:08.686 --> 43:10.865
Your dream?
That we had moved to London?

43:10.865 --> 43:13.321
It just happened, Ted.
We both fought it.

43:13.321 --> 43:17.259
I'm sure you fought it, in every hotel
room, on every matress, in a backseat.

43:17.383 --> 43:18.883
This isn't about sex.

43:18.883 --> 43:21.519
It's always about sex.
Everything is about sex.

43:21.865 --> 43:23.132
The economies are about sex.

43:23.132 --> 43:25.372
I can't have this
outburst with you on the street.

43:25.372 --> 43:28.754
You, with my best friend.
It's such a cliché, I can't believe it.

43:28.754 --> 43:30.773
Don't get down on 
Larry, he adores you.

43:30.905 --> 43:32.247
He identifies with you.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.195
I know, he uses my 
aftershave, and my wife.

43:35.624 --> 43:36.476
Who is she?

43:36.476 --> 43:38.719
- Ted, is everything okay?
- What does that have to do with anything?

43:38.719 --> 43:41.695
- Who is she?
- No, everything is fine, stay there Ashleigh.

43:41.828 --> 43:42.834
Keep dry.

43:43.965 --> 43:46.638
- I'm with the Yardley Argus.
- The what?

43:47.134 --> 43:50.313
- The Yardley Argus.
- She's a reporter, doing a piece on Rollie.

43:50.351 --> 43:52.952
On Rollie? Then what is she doing
with you, following me?

43:52.952 --> 43:54.532
- Don't try and turn this around.
- I'm not turning...

43:54.532 --> 43:57.516
Don't try and turn this around.
You've been caught. You're caught.

43:57.686 --> 44:02.433
You, who make a fool of yourself
over every young, ambitious starlet model.

44:02.433 --> 44:04.596
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

44:04.596 --> 44:07.341
You've been having an
affair with Larry Lipszyc.

44:07.341 --> 44:10.247
And you are spying on me with who?
Your 15-year-old concubine?

44:10.247 --> 44:10.838
She's a journalist.

44:10.838 --> 44:12.087
- I'm 21.
- She's 21.

44:12.087 --> 44:13.624
She's 21?
- She's a journalist.

44:13.624 --> 44:15.834
- I have a proof of age, actually.
- No, you don't need this.

44:15.882 --> 44:17.122
This always happens in bars.

44:17.159 --> 44:19.335
- You've been caight.
- You know what, as long as you are a reporter.

44:19.335 --> 44:21.989
I would like to make a
press release about my husband.

44:22.373 --> 44:24.577
- Really?
- Can I write this down?

44:24.577 --> 44:25.935
- Sure, go ahead.
- Ashleigh, please.

44:25.935 --> 44:30.302
Ask him how many times
he has been unfaithful to me?

44:30.305 --> 44:32.035
She's demented.
You're demented.

44:32.035 --> 44:36.287
- His secretary, the actresses, the poetess.
- Wrong, wrong.

44:36.426 --> 44:37.860
- The poetess?
- The poetess?

44:37.860 --> 44:39.614
Were all these women for
a pleasure or for some project?

44:39.848 --> 44:42.026
Stop filling her head with lies.
Ashleigh, come here.

44:42.345 --> 44:47.685
Take this address to the studio, okay?
Find Rollie, come on.

44:48.223 --> 44:50.769
- Find Rollie.
- I don't know my way around New York.

44:50.769 --> 44:52.509
It's okay, tell the cab driver...

44:52.509 --> 44:55.249
- Find Rollie. Stop.
- Ask him if he ever slep with Samantha Leroy.

44:55.581 --> 44:59.715
- The Argus is not a tabloid.
- There are no papers that are not tabloid.

44:59.715 --> 45:02.913
Encourage him about the movie,
so he doesn't mangle it and ruin it, okay?

45:02.913 --> 45:04.440
Please, don't print any of this.

45:04.591 --> 45:07.351
- Don't worry, we always protect there from naughty.
- I'm sure.

45:07.996 --> 45:08.872
Connie!

45:10.457 --> 45:11.457
Connie!

45:17.198 --> 45:19.831
The first time I kissed your
sister was in this museum.

45:19.998 --> 45:21.049
I know, she told me.

45:21.049 --> 45:23.513
She said that you were 
looking at a Hieronymus Bosch

45:23.513 --> 45:24.762
and it made you feel romantic.

45:24.762 --> 45:25.878
So that you kissed her.

45:25.899 --> 45:28.145
As of she knew your
shrink wasn't helping you.

45:28.317 --> 45:30.279
Don't tell she got 
the kiss of the 4.

45:30.646 --> 45:33.675
If she'd quoted you a figure 
higher I'd have her audited.

45:39.092 --> 45:42.185
There's something charming
about that elegance.

45:43.394 --> 45:46.814
My mother would've liked Sargent
to have painted her in just that pose.

45:48.107 --> 45:50.526
The dressed so beautifully
in Paris back then.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.655
I could see moving to Paris.

45:54.011 --> 45:57.222
I never really asked you.
What are you future plans, Gatsby?

45:58.640 --> 45:59.921
I don't know, I'm floundering.

46:00.332 --> 46:01.469
What does that mean?

46:01.597 --> 46:02.906
I don't know 
who I want to be.

46:03.563 --> 46:05.662
I just know what I don't 
want to be, is that terrible?

46:05.984 --> 46:07.694
So you have no game plan?

46:08.157 --> 46:10.756
I know I don't 
want to be a test pilot,

46:10.756 --> 46:13.542
or clergyman 
or proctologist, so...

46:14.266 --> 46:15.673
Ruled those out.

46:16.475 --> 46:17.977
I get it, you don't fit in.

46:18.603 --> 46:21.177
That's why I always had a crush
on you when you dated Amy.

46:21.177 --> 46:23.346
- You had a crush on me?
- I did, isn't it weird?

46:23.763 --> 46:27.464
I don't know, maybe it's because
you took her to do oddball things.

46:27.613 --> 46:29.616
You took her to one 
of those divey piano bars,

46:29.616 --> 46:31.078
where no one 
else ever took her.

46:31.642 --> 46:33.455
I did take her to her 
first crap game.

46:33.455 --> 46:36.437
I know and I loved that.
I loved hearing every detail.

46:36.791 --> 46:38.658
I was hoping she would
get serious with you,

46:38.658 --> 46:41.478
because you were not like
all the other idiots she dated.

46:41.968 --> 46:44.195
I thought you 
were a special idiot.

46:44.551 --> 46:46.232
I'm glad I impressed you, Chan.

46:47.575 --> 46:50.407
I remember Amy came home and 
she told me that you took her to

46:50.407 --> 46:53.509
Ballbay scene at Central Park 
and made love to her.

46:54.499 --> 46:57.002
- She told you about that?
- Every moist detail.

46:57.169 --> 46:58.521
Now I embarrassed.

46:58.658 --> 47:00.639
Don't be, that night
she gave you a 6.

47:00.639 --> 47:02.522
She gave me a 6?
Amy.

47:03.236 --> 47:04.591
With a asterix.

47:04.591 --> 47:06.296
She said you 
were a little tense.

47:06.539 --> 47:09.423
Yeah, Central Park can be a
little dangerous at 2 AM.

47:09.423 --> 47:11.371
- But very romantic.
- Okay.

47:11.371 --> 47:13.009
And then it started to rain.

47:13.416 --> 47:14.751
That was the best part.

47:15.293 --> 47:19.005
Her hair got wet, her clothes
started to cling to her body.

47:19.503 --> 47:22.325
- She started sneezing.
- I don't really remember that part.

47:23.924 --> 47:25.334
Now that I think of it, Chan.

47:26.330 --> 47:29.047
You always were around,
giving me the fish eye.

47:29.948 --> 47:31.575
You are just realising this now?

47:35.838 --> 47:36.911
That's all you have to say?

47:36.911 --> 47:39.685
You didn't think I was
cute or attractive, anything?

47:41.042 --> 47:42.043
You seemed fine.

47:42.626 --> 47:45.158
You mean I had no
physical deformities.

47:45.304 --> 47:48.120
I didn't have acromegaly
or a hunchback.

47:48.288 --> 47:49.898
You know what, Chan, I wasn't
really paying attention,

47:49.898 --> 47:52.131
because I was a little tense
in front of your parents.

47:53.081 --> 47:56.451
Amy would make her entrance,
like a, goddamn, Miss America.

47:57.436 --> 47:59.316
I'm sure Ashleigh is 
a beauty queen type.

47:59.316 --> 48:03.108
She is, she was an actual first-place
winner at her high school in Tuscon.

48:03.421 --> 48:04.606
4H, right?

48:05.206 --> 48:06.616
Yes, how did you guess?

48:07.259 --> 48:08.927
Ink it in.
Let's get out of here.

48:11.369 --> 48:15.095
These crazy egyptians, they
put all their money on an afterlife.

48:15.558 --> 48:18.431
Listen, Gatsby, let me tell you,
you only look once.

48:18.577 --> 48:20.853
But once is enough if
you find the right person.

48:22.287 --> 48:24.568
You think she's giving me
a runaround today?

48:25.041 --> 48:26.572
I'm struggling to
keep my spirits up.

48:26.970 --> 48:28.930
You really are hooked
on her, aren't you?

48:31.279 --> 48:32.238
Oh my God!

48:32.530 --> 48:35.283
That's my aunt and uncle!
They're here for my mother's party.

48:35.806 --> 48:36.290
What party?

48:36.290 --> 48:38.021
They remembered the date - 
my mother's party tonight,

48:38.021 --> 48:39.208
They going to 
tell her I'm here.

48:39.208 --> 48:40.762
- Okay.
- I can't discuss this, I have to hide.

48:40.883 --> 48:43.879
Why don't you duck into the
mummy case, I'll get some white tape.

48:44.582 --> 48:49.593
<font color="#00ffff">Subtitles by sub.Trader
subscene.com</font>

48:57.277 --> 48:57.986
Hello?

48:58.275 --> 49:02.268
Gatsby, I finally got alone.
Where are you?

49:02.869 --> 49:05.455
Let me put is this way.
Have you heard of King Tut?

49:06.340 --> 49:09.061
You are where?
What are you doing?

49:17.804 --> 49:19.926
Hello?
Gatsby, hello?

49:23.580 --> 49:26.041
Gatsby, what a surprise!

49:26.208 --> 49:28.002
I was about to 
call your mother.

49:35.551 --> 49:36.865
Hi, can I help you?

49:37.379 --> 49:38.991
I'm looking for Roland Pollard.

49:39.106 --> 49:41.073
Roland Pollard?
Right, he was here earlier.

49:41.559 --> 49:43.131
I'm not sure
if he's still back there.

49:43.895 --> 49:45.563
Mom, it was all planned, okay?

49:45.563 --> 49:47.568
Ashleigh and I wanted 
to surprise you tonight.

49:47.568 --> 49:50.262
I happen to run into uncle
Tyler and aunt Grace, okay?

49:50.262 --> 49:52.016
But don't worry, we are 
going to be there for dinner,

49:52.016 --> 49:53.669
 it's going to be a 
great time, I just...

49:53.669 --> 49:56.714
I thought it would be a
fun surprise.

49:56.964 --> 49:59.300
Oh, we spoiled your surprise.

50:00.361 --> 50:01.487
Mr. Pollard?

50:04.282 --> 50:05.158
Rollie?

50:06.492 --> 50:07.243
Hello.

50:07.544 --> 50:08.739
Can I help you?

50:09.650 --> 50:11.360
Have you seen Mr. Pollard?

50:11.835 --> 50:14.711
Rollie's gone.
He left an hour ago.

50:16.120 --> 50:17.329
Did he seem okay?

50:19.290 --> 50:22.501
To be honest, he seemed
a little drunk to me.

50:23.878 --> 50:24.837
Are you two friends?

50:27.548 --> 50:30.134
Oh my God!
You're Francisco Vega.

50:31.249 --> 50:32.292
Is that good or bad?

50:33.745 --> 50:37.299
If my roommate was here,
she'd hemorrhage.

50:39.126 --> 50:42.129
She thinks you are the greatest thing to
come along since the morning-after pill.

50:43.036 --> 50:43.911
Me too.

50:45.538 --> 50:47.540
I can't believe I'm talking
to Francisco Vega.

50:48.710 --> 50:52.600
Look at me, I'm a journalist
and I'm reduced to total adolescence.

50:55.008 --> 50:57.385
- You're Francisco Vega!
- I know that.

50:58.252 --> 51:00.212
I guess the key question
here is - who are you?

51:01.050 --> 51:04.431
Who am I? Is that what
you're asking who I am?

51:05.973 --> 51:08.809
- My identity?
- Yeah, is it coming to you?

51:11.606 --> 51:13.733
I can't believe I'm blanking on it.

51:14.150 --> 51:15.133
Check your driver's license.

51:16.229 --> 51:18.769
Right.
Yeah, right.

51:20.628 --> 51:21.370
Okay.

51:22.809 --> 51:25.047
I'm Ashleigh Enright.

51:25.299 --> 51:26.592
I knew it would be on there.

51:30.095 --> 51:32.266
I work for the Yardley Argus.
I write for them.

51:32.430 --> 51:35.487
And I'm here in New York, because
I'm interviewing Mr. Pollard.

51:35.881 --> 51:38.592
Wow, you look exatly the
same but better.

51:39.841 --> 51:41.237
Let me tell you something.

51:41.537 --> 51:44.749
You look more beautiful than 
any journalist I've ever met.

51:45.712 --> 51:47.673
You can make a very
sexy anchorwoman.

51:47.839 --> 51:50.053
How can you say that when
you're in the papers every week

51:50.053 --> 51:51.974
with those die-models
and actresses?

51:52.054 --> 51:52.877
- Get in, get in.
- Where are we going?

51:52.877 --> 51:53.952
Not now guys, not now.

51:53.952 --> 51:56.417
Come on, give us a break!
Come on! No!

51:57.660 --> 51:58.909
Should I be in here?

51:59.363 --> 52:00.598
Make yourself at home.

52:02.310 --> 52:04.145
- Would you like to sit down?
- No, no, no.

52:04.312 --> 52:05.855
- Would you like a drink?
- No thanks.

52:06.022 --> 52:07.399
Would you like to
have dinner with me?

52:08.463 --> 52:10.052
Would I like to
have what with you?

52:11.372 --> 52:14.177
I have no plans, but to
get an early bite and then.

52:14.690 --> 52:16.756
You and I can go
to a party together.

52:16.925 --> 52:18.802
Party?
Dinner?

52:22.540 --> 52:24.333
What about Tiffany Griffin?
I though...

52:24.333 --> 52:25.687
- I don't want to talk about her.
- You two were twosome.

52:25.806 --> 52:27.444
No, we just broke up.

52:28.242 --> 52:30.196
I'm going to change 
into my street clothes.

52:30.348 --> 52:32.087
While you think about it, okay?

52:37.356 --> 52:38.274
Oh, Gosh.

52:39.761 --> 52:43.306
Great, now I have to take Ashleigh
to my Mom's, goddamn, party.

52:43.707 --> 52:45.000
Why is that so bad?

52:45.250 --> 52:47.554
Why is that so bad, Chan?
Because I wanted to spend the night

52:47.554 --> 52:52.097
with Ashleigh alone in New York,
not with forego of wasp plutocrats.

52:52.483 --> 52:55.214
A forego of wasp plutocrats?

52:55.357 --> 52:58.152
Sounds like something on
the menu out of a fusion restaurant.

52:58.944 --> 53:02.541
I'm not interested in the euro, or
how many Basquiats somebody owns,

53:02.541 --> 53:04.744
or whether they prefer a
falcon to a gulfstream.

53:05.467 --> 53:07.377
These things have no
meaning to me.

53:07.871 --> 53:10.327
I noticed you haven't
renounced your family's money.

53:11.041 --> 53:12.069
What does that mean?

53:12.810 --> 53:14.980
That means you could move out.

53:15.282 --> 53:17.583
Get a job, put 
yourself through college.

53:17.865 --> 53:18.910
Oh yeah, as of what?

53:20.246 --> 53:22.060
Piano player in the dive.

53:22.427 --> 53:26.181
Or, maybe a poker player?
Dice hustler?

53:27.032 --> 53:29.493
You're bad, Chan.
You are going straight to hell.

53:30.286 --> 53:33.414
There is something romantic
about gamblers.

53:33.872 --> 53:36.834
And old songs.
Meeting under the clock.

53:37.626 --> 53:39.712
Yeah, maybe in movies,
but this is real life.

53:40.587 --> 53:43.048
Real life is fine for people
who can't do any better.

53:46.175 --> 53:49.785
It's been fun killing time with you.
Have fun with blue neves tonight.

53:50.218 --> 53:51.928
- Who?
- Your skin doctor.

53:53.388 --> 53:56.641
At least he knows enough not to
wind up in the egyptian tomb.

54:03.940 --> 54:06.276
- Vega!
- Francisco!

54:06.609 --> 54:08.945
- Thanks for being here.
- It is always like this?

54:10.738 --> 54:11.656
This is nothing.

54:13.491 --> 54:16.411
I'm just signing one.
Thank you, thank you for being here.

54:17.745 --> 54:19.330
Sorry, we have to go.
Sorry.

54:22.917 --> 54:24.711
- Francisco, who is the young lady?
- I'm no one.

54:24.878 --> 54:27.164
- What do you do?
- I'm no one really.

54:27.475 --> 54:31.395
I was Miss Amiability in Scottsdale.
Not really a big deal.

54:31.751 --> 54:32.711
Where did you guys meet?

54:33.462 --> 54:34.379
Let's go, come on.

54:36.602 --> 54:37.858
No story here.

54:38.099 --> 54:40.385
Okay, thank you.
Thank you for being here.

54:40.788 --> 54:42.473
Ciao, ciao, ciao.

54:42.849 --> 54:46.065
That's it, that's it.
Alright, thank you for coming, thank you.

54:47.177 --> 54:49.429
There is so much the public
wants to know about you.

54:50.417 --> 54:54.045
Is it true that you were born on the
Orient Express right outside of Budapest.

54:54.987 --> 54:57.138
Are your 2 sisters as
beautiful as you are?

54:58.106 --> 55:00.067
Please be honest, 
but be modest.

55:02.527 --> 55:03.737
They are, yeah.

55:06.406 --> 55:07.657
They are actually even pretier.

55:08.492 --> 55:09.637
Taylor especially.

55:09.637 --> 55:12.261
She looks a little bit like
your girlfriend Tiffany Griffin.

55:12.656 --> 55:14.283
- Could be worse.
- Yeah.

55:17.619 --> 55:21.707
Are you seriously considering
making remake of "White Heat"?

55:21.873 --> 55:23.917
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Me?

55:25.252 --> 55:28.422
Yeah. Sorry I shouldn't
have asked that.

55:29.047 --> 55:31.842
Sorry, I've been drinking.

55:33.176 --> 55:38.015
The candle lights are coloring
your face in quite an amazing way.

55:40.689 --> 55:44.359
I'm sorry, you have a very
affective smile, you know?

55:45.860 --> 55:49.530
I couldn't help but ask
if you have a boyfriend or not.

55:50.990 --> 55:54.160
Do I have a boyfriend.
Is that what you're asking?

55:58.289 --> 56:01.042
Yes and, technically, no.

56:02.356 --> 56:04.915
There's this boy at Yardley.

56:07.158 --> 56:09.783
But he's just a boy.
He's a mere youth.

56:11.069 --> 56:12.910
We dated a few times.

56:14.145 --> 56:15.806
You must be crazy about him.

56:16.548 --> 56:18.591
Is he the captain
of the football team?

56:19.797 --> 56:22.633
Football?
Gatsby? No.

56:23.151 --> 56:25.367
No, he doesn't play football.

56:26.421 --> 56:28.389
He likes to figure
out the point spread.

56:28.943 --> 56:30.531
So the mathematician.

56:32.113 --> 56:33.657
Not exactly.

56:34.575 --> 56:35.743
Gatsby is a...

56:37.286 --> 56:38.662
Gatsby is very dear.

56:40.451 --> 56:42.221
Very amusing.

56:42.653 --> 56:45.291
He's unusual.
Quaint.

56:47.366 --> 56:50.805
That's the world I would
use to describe Gatsby - quaint.

56:52.618 --> 56:53.662
He's exotic.

56:54.311 --> 57:00.834
Searching, shall we say, for his
romantic dream from a vanished age.

57:04.073 --> 57:06.909
- What is this wine?
- It's Chateau Meyney.

57:09.394 --> 57:11.438
I shouldn't imbibe so copiously.

57:13.023 --> 57:16.276
Alcohol plays havoc on
my cerebral neurons.

57:17.679 --> 57:18.513
And how?

57:20.209 --> 57:21.630
I lose my sensor.

57:22.630 --> 57:26.017
I become loose, uninhibited.

57:27.041 --> 57:31.280
passionate, aggressive, wicked.

57:31.855 --> 57:32.832
Absurd.

57:38.486 --> 57:39.403
Hello.

57:40.488 --> 57:41.739
Is this where the poker game is?

57:42.156 --> 57:44.075
- Who are you?
- My name is Gatsby Welles.

57:44.286 --> 57:46.747
- Who?
- He's okay, that's Hunter's brother.

57:48.499 --> 57:50.581
I'm just going to take
Hunter's chair if that's alright.

57:50.581 --> 57:53.042
Yeah, Hunter called and
said you might sit in.

57:54.835 --> 57:56.624
You sure you want
to play this game?

57:56.624 --> 57:58.317
He's alright.
Hunter says he's a shark.

57:59.326 --> 58:01.244
- Better watch out for him.
- Like a guppy.

58:02.663 --> 58:05.916
If you guys are worried,
I have a little something.

58:06.083 --> 58:08.418
- This kid is loaded.
- Have a seat then, my friend.

58:22.647 --> 58:24.023
I will call that.

58:28.892 --> 58:31.582
This is crazy.
Maybe something's happened to her?

58:31.758 --> 58:33.288
Maybe she's in 
some kind of trouble.

58:33.999 --> 58:35.250
Raise, two thousand.

58:36.915 --> 58:38.955
Maybe the story 
led her into danger.

58:39.112 --> 58:41.392
Maybe she was 
kidnapped or murdered.

58:41.981 --> 58:43.274
Should I call the police?

58:44.233 --> 58:46.902
Of course, it would be so
embarrassing if she turn up alive.

58:47.958 --> 58:51.670
Hey kid, do you going to call or not?
That's two thousand dollars.

58:59.674 --> 59:00.550
I raise you.

59:03.928 --> 59:06.055
I reraise you.
All-in.

59:48.534 --> 59:51.669
With temperature's in the 60s, 
rain is predicted this evening.

59:51.669 --> 59:53.446
It will be heavy at times.

59:53.601 --> 59:55.741
And more of it tomorrow, 
mostly cloudy

59:55.741 --> 59:57.940
with the chance of showers 
in the late afternoon.

59:58.073 --> 01:00:01.260
On a brighter note: 
Francisco Vega is in town

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.612
with his new 
main-squeeze on his own.

01:00:03.765 --> 01:00:05.998
All our spies could
find out is that she's

01:00:06.184 --> 01:00:09.017
Ashleigh Enright, a beauty queen,
from Tuscon, Arizona.

01:00:09.017 --> 01:00:11.929
They were spotted later having
drinks over candle light, and

01:00:11.929 --> 01:00:14.145
apparently exchaging 
sweet nothings.

01:00:14.443 --> 01:00:18.405
I was Miss Amiability in Scottsdale.
Not really a big deal.

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:20.835
- How did you guys meet?
- Who's the girl?

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:24.750
Good luck, Francisco,
we are all rooting for you.

01:00:24.931 --> 01:00:27.183
That gorgeous couple,
as if they need out help.

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:32.603
Jesus, I need a drink.

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.899
I need a drink.
I need a cigarette.

01:00:38.776 --> 01:00:40.945
What I really need
is a Berlin ballad.

01:00:54.292 --> 01:00:55.251
May I get you another?

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.378
Yeah, why don't you
make it a double.

01:00:57.378 --> 01:00:58.337
You want a double?

01:00:59.109 --> 01:01:01.385
It's okay, I won't be operating
any form of machinery.

01:01:09.807 --> 01:01:10.668
Hello.

01:01:12.777 --> 01:01:15.571
Mom, you have to give me a chance.
I said I was going to be there tonight.

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:19.594
Ashleigh's fine.

01:01:22.396 --> 01:01:24.894
Yes, I'll wear a tie and I'll
be there on time, okay?

01:01:24.894 --> 01:01:26.776
I can't really talk right now.

01:01:36.085 --> 01:01:39.338
Francisco Vega.
A bullshit actor.

01:01:39.881 --> 01:01:42.008
This guy is incapable 
of a real moment.

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:47.500
All those manured gestures and all
that phony self-promoting liberal politics.

01:01:47.883 --> 01:01:51.471
When he offered to set himself
on fire to protest climate change,

01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:52.692
they should've let him.

01:01:53.631 --> 01:01:55.174
If that's Ashleigh's taste.

01:01:56.343 --> 01:01:58.345
The world is full of
beautiful women.

01:01:59.929 --> 01:02:01.492
Sorry, are you talking to me?

01:02:01.627 --> 01:02:03.649
I'm sorry, I was actually
talking to myself.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.541
I know the feeling.

01:02:08.047 --> 01:02:10.041
Have you seen a movie
"Out of the Past"?

01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:13.127
- Excuse me?
- Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum.

01:02:14.587 --> 01:02:16.653
She was bad news.

01:02:17.062 --> 01:02:18.542
It's the luck of the draw.

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.207
- Are you alone?
- I am.

01:02:21.508 --> 01:02:23.122
Unless you want
some company.

01:02:24.957 --> 01:02:25.874
Sure.

01:02:29.626 --> 01:02:30.720
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:02:30.891 --> 01:02:33.589
- I'm Terry Ford.
- My name is Gatsby Welles.

01:02:33.745 --> 01:02:35.455
What's the matter, Gatsby?
You seem gloom.

01:02:37.081 --> 01:02:38.958
My girlfriend dumped
me for a movie star.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.683
You know what they say:
you can't fight charisma.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.831
I didn't want to
drink in my room alone.

01:02:49.322 --> 01:02:50.588
Are you staying here?

01:02:50.835 --> 01:02:54.881
No, I've been coming here since they
used to only serve me ginger ales by law.

01:02:55.164 --> 01:02:56.633
I love the piano players.

01:02:57.728 --> 01:02:59.939
And now I'm old enough
to order gin and vermouth.

01:03:01.104 --> 01:03:02.189
Time flies.

01:03:02.892 --> 01:03:05.497
Yeah, unfortunately, 
it flies, coach.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.518
What's that supposed to mean?

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.204
It's not always a
comfortable trip.

01:03:12.948 --> 01:03:13.866
Tell me about it.

01:03:16.044 --> 01:03:17.336
What are you doing
here all alone?

01:03:18.807 --> 01:03:19.706
Working.

01:03:20.572 --> 01:03:21.629
What do you do?

01:03:22.067 --> 01:03:23.444
I make dreams come true.

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:28.282
- How do you do that?
- Use your imaginion.

01:03:34.079 --> 01:03:35.998
Do we go someplace where
we could be more alone?

01:03:38.712 --> 01:03:40.057
Sure.

01:03:40.718 --> 01:03:41.653
Why not.

01:03:41.962 --> 01:03:42.868
Okay.

01:03:43.345 --> 01:03:44.596
I get five hundred, sweetie.

01:03:46.264 --> 01:03:47.140
Five hundred?

01:03:48.641 --> 01:03:49.559
Right.

01:03:49.767 --> 01:03:52.573
I know what's you are thinking.
Five hunderd seems pretty steep.

01:03:53.777 --> 01:03:54.861
But it's New York.

01:03:56.443 --> 01:03:57.944
How would you like
to make five thousand?

01:03:59.131 --> 01:04:00.007
Five thousand?

01:04:01.953 --> 01:04:03.170
To do what?

01:04:03.403 --> 01:04:05.536
Just to be my date for a
few hours at the party.

01:04:06.345 --> 01:04:09.567
Clothes stay on, no fondling,
no exhange of fluids.

01:04:10.198 --> 01:04:11.888
Just a little role playing.

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.461
What kind of party?

01:04:14.253 --> 01:04:18.633
Just my Mom's big fall,
bullshit blowout.

01:04:19.492 --> 01:04:22.369
I won 15 G's in the poker game
and I need a date with me.

01:04:22.909 --> 01:04:26.371
Classy item, who answers the
name of Ashleigh Enright.

01:04:27.978 --> 01:04:29.652
- I hope I'm dressed okay.
- Absolutely.

01:04:29.652 --> 01:04:30.642
It's a little fancy.

01:04:31.179 --> 01:04:32.514
- You look perfrect.
- Okay.

01:04:34.049 --> 01:04:36.179
These things can be a
little boring, alright?

01:04:36.814 --> 01:04:38.214
Thank you for coming.

01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:39.787
- Hey, Vega.
- How are you?

01:04:39.787 --> 01:04:42.654
- Very good.
- Good to see you.

01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:44.432
This guy is the best cook.

01:04:44.432 --> 01:04:46.378
You have to make 
on of those paella again.

01:04:46.378 --> 01:04:47.672
- Hi, doll.
- Hey.

01:04:48.691 --> 01:04:49.158
How are you?

01:04:49.158 --> 01:04:51.224
I wondered if I could steal
you away for 2 minutes

01:04:51.224 --> 01:04:53.793
to talk about your fall schedule
and project with your name on it.

01:04:53.793 --> 01:04:54.664
- Right now?
- Yes now.

01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:56.878
Okay, okay, do you mind?
Just 2 minutes.

01:04:56.878 --> 01:04:57.946
- Are you going to be okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:57.946 --> 01:04:59.099
Yeah? Sure?

01:04:59.471 --> 01:05:00.254
I'll be fast.

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.520
Thank you.

01:05:08.357 --> 01:05:10.253
- You're Gabriela Summers.
- Yes.

01:05:10.253 --> 01:05:12.081
I have so many
questions for you.

01:05:13.001 --> 01:05:14.586
- For my article.
- Okay.

01:05:16.036 --> 01:05:18.498
It's not that much farther.
It's just up the corner here.

01:05:18.793 --> 01:05:20.010
Great, I love to walk.

01:05:20.151 --> 01:05:22.039
It's actually the 
same house I grew up in.

01:05:23.273 --> 01:05:25.384
I bet you went to one
of those fancy school?

01:05:25.384 --> 01:05:26.661
Yeah, I did.

01:05:27.515 --> 01:05:31.143
Is true that all the kids there
have charge accounts at Bergdorf and Prada

01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:33.724
and spend lots of money
and do lots of drugs?

01:05:33.769 --> 01:05:35.766
I wouldn't know, I didn't hang
out with the most of the kids.

01:05:35.766 --> 01:05:38.264
I just liked to watch old
movies and play my violin.

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:39.802
It's kind of weird.

01:05:41.358 --> 01:05:42.542
You were a bookworm?

01:05:42.967 --> 01:05:44.405
Not really.
My mother is just...

01:05:45.196 --> 01:05:48.523
Culture vulture, according to
her I must visit this museum.

01:05:48.523 --> 01:05:51.862
Or I must attend this piano
recital, or see this opera.

01:05:52.146 --> 01:05:56.184
I must read my Henry James, even if Henry
James puts me to sleep, you know?

01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:58.046
I like Charlie Parker.

01:05:58.538 --> 01:05:59.855
Who's that?

01:06:00.751 --> 01:06:02.536
Forget it, that's alright.

01:06:02.536 --> 01:06:03.941
You really are in a bad mood.

01:06:04.978 --> 01:06:06.238
There you are.

01:06:06.385 --> 01:06:07.373
Excuse me for the interruption.

01:06:07.373 --> 01:06:09.250
- You're here.
- Yes, I am.

01:06:09.896 --> 01:06:11.272
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:06:11.982 --> 01:06:14.151
I had to get my
thoughts in line.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.561
You vanished off the planet.
Mr. tortured artist.

01:06:17.865 --> 01:06:19.636
Can I speak to you
alone for a minute?

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.116
Yeah.

01:06:21.927 --> 01:06:23.957
I have actually been
dying to talk to you.

01:06:24.369 --> 01:06:26.812
Your movie was so much better
than you let me to believe.

01:06:26.812 --> 01:06:27.688
Yes?

01:06:28.063 --> 01:06:32.067
And the climax was so moving.
It was very vintage Roland Pollard.

01:06:33.277 --> 01:06:34.194
Sit.

01:06:37.019 --> 01:06:39.730
I was afraid I wasn't
going to see you again.

01:06:41.858 --> 01:06:44.819
Forgive me.
I'm a little drunk.

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:47.613
We were very
worried about you.

01:06:48.406 --> 01:06:52.994
I spent the day, thinking,
reflecting about my work, my life.

01:06:55.788 --> 01:06:58.207
I want for us to get to
know each other, Ashleigh.

01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:00.585
You do?

01:07:01.294 --> 01:07:03.921
Would you consider coming
with to the South of France?

01:07:04.714 --> 01:07:06.007
The where of what?

01:07:07.047 --> 01:07:12.303
Your voice is the only voice, that's
adding me clarity for me in ages.

01:07:12.469 --> 01:07:16.473
The only voice that enouraged
me, what I actually believed in.

01:07:18.225 --> 01:07:19.226
Like a muse.

01:07:21.187 --> 01:07:23.200
I think you had too
much to drink today.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.866
I know I have.

01:07:26.066 --> 01:07:26.942
Come with me.

01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:30.384
You can wake up every
morning, smelling orange trees.

01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:34.435
I'll talk to you about
my new movie

01:07:34.735 --> 01:07:37.468
and I can learn from your
own spoiled honesty.

01:07:39.843 --> 01:07:42.512
You can smell the orange trees.

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:47.936
I think you are confusing me
with this like total, other Ashley.

01:07:48.478 --> 01:07:49.854
L-E-Y spelling.

01:07:51.988 --> 01:07:53.531
I thought that was you!

01:07:54.324 --> 01:07:55.241
Ashleigh.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.312
- You are here.
- I'm here.

01:07:58.312 --> 01:08:00.444
Everybody's here.
Roland's here.

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.670
I came with him.
I was trying...

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:04.509
I was trying to figure
out a way to cantact you.

01:08:05.429 --> 01:08:08.392
- I apologise for today.
- It's okay.

01:08:08.392 --> 01:08:10.575
You were very very
understanding, thank you.

01:08:10.755 --> 01:08:12.716
- I felt really bad for you.
- No, no, no, I'm fine.

01:08:13.628 --> 01:08:16.926
I'm fine, I'm about as well
as it could be expected.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:17.884
Yeah.

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.438
For a guy, that just
discovered that

01:08:22.944 --> 01:08:25.453
- his wife is with his best friend.
- Yeah.

01:08:25.856 --> 01:08:27.745
- You're at the party!
- I am at the party.

01:08:27.745 --> 01:08:29.640
I got home, I got 
to my appartment

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.953
and I was wondering 
why Connie's infidelity

01:08:32.473 --> 01:08:34.386
didn't wound me as
deeply as it should.

01:08:35.938 --> 01:08:38.997
I kept thinking about, I remembered
what you said about my movies.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:41.859
And I thought, my God, 
why is Ashleigh's

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.944
approbation is so meanigful to me?

01:08:44.542 --> 01:08:47.154
Really, it was.
And it strucked me, it stricked me.

01:08:47.154 --> 01:08:48.759
You and I were 
thrown together.

01:08:49.356 --> 01:08:54.536
We were trying to find a wandering
rogue Roland Pollard.

01:08:54.536 --> 01:08:57.569
We had an adventure together.
And in the movie version.

01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:01.107
In my movie version, the guy
who looks up and he realises

01:09:01.546 --> 01:09:04.009
 he's fallen in 
love with the girl.

01:09:05.692 --> 01:09:08.773
- I've played that role so many times.
- Writers like this does not come along...

01:09:08.773 --> 01:09:09.691
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:09:12.151 --> 01:09:14.464
I'm going to call Sam if you
don't answer me by Friday.

01:09:14.464 --> 01:09:15.987
Yes, alright, ciao.

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:18.843
- I'm sorry, it took me so long.
- It's so funny.

01:09:18.962 --> 01:09:21.889
My father would always say when
drinking you should never mix

01:09:22.196 --> 01:09:23.693
grain and grape together.

01:09:24.073 --> 01:09:26.053
But I think they
go really good.

01:09:28.508 --> 01:09:29.939
I think we should split.

01:09:30.853 --> 01:09:31.917
We should split?

01:09:36.283 --> 01:09:40.153
Gatsby, if you always intended to
come you should've told us.

01:09:40.645 --> 01:09:42.939
You know I am
not fond of surprises.

01:09:43.398 --> 01:09:47.193
Mother, Dad, this is
my girlfriend Ashleigh Enright.

01:09:47.514 --> 01:09:48.432
Hi, how are you?

01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:51.234
- How lovely to meet you, Ashleigh.
- You too.

01:09:51.299 --> 01:09:53.180
- One's a pleasure.
- Hi, how are you?

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.694
- I'm well, thanks.
- Nice to meet you.

01:09:54.694 --> 01:09:58.240
- I've done business with your father.
- Yes, he speaks very highly of you.

01:09:58.990 --> 01:10:01.493
Actually, I've never
met him, it's his bank.

01:10:01.826 --> 01:10:03.787
Yes, he's got so many banks.

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:07.108
How are things at Yardley?

01:10:07.419 --> 01:10:11.256
It's very quiet, we get a lot of snow
in the winter, that sort of thing.

01:10:11.633 --> 01:10:13.828
Very rural, but I chose 
it because they have

01:10:13.951 --> 01:10:16.338
a great Kurdish 
studies program, yes.

01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:18.196
Have you thought
more about the career?

01:10:18.196 --> 01:10:21.616
Your father was bemoaning the fact
that you are still undecided.

01:10:22.243 --> 01:10:23.753
I have, Leonard.

01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:25.922
I want to go into nuclear physics

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:28.558
and maybe open a little 
store and sell dark matter.

01:10:29.104 --> 01:10:30.353
He's kidding you. No.

01:10:30.772 --> 01:10:34.118
He likes to sit at the piano
and sing, and play blackjack.

01:10:34.859 --> 01:10:38.812
And when you were a boy, your mother
wanted you to be a concert pianist.

01:10:39.543 --> 01:10:41.307
She always had 
big plans for me.

01:10:41.307 --> 01:10:43.202
How about you, Ashleigh?
What are your plans?

01:10:43.202 --> 01:10:46.205
- She wants to be a journalist, actually.
- TV or print?

01:10:46.321 --> 01:10:48.725
- Political stuff, she'll report from all of the...
- TV, I'd like to do the weather.

01:10:48.959 --> 01:10:49.954
Troubled spots.

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:51.357
On the weather.

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:57.312
Right.

01:11:00.007 --> 01:11:04.025
You've been staring at Ashleigh all
night long, is there something wrong?

01:11:04.531 --> 01:11:06.708
There is something
about that girl.

01:11:06.857 --> 01:11:08.297
She's quite pretty.

01:11:08.641 --> 01:11:11.039
And sophisticated for 
a young girl.

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:22.825
Come on in.

01:11:25.756 --> 01:11:27.007
- Look at this place.
- Nice, isn't it?

01:11:28.111 --> 01:11:31.740
What was that all about with
Ted Davidoff and Rollie Pollard?

01:11:32.854 --> 01:11:33.951
We were just talking.

01:11:34.218 --> 01:11:35.571
Yeah? Alright.

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:37.936
Don't worry.

01:11:38.849 --> 01:11:41.252
I'm sure they are very interested
in that story you are writing.

01:11:42.051 --> 01:11:43.802
Today has been 
quite a story.

01:11:45.879 --> 01:11:48.672
And that's just the beginning.
Please, sit down.

01:11:49.512 --> 01:11:50.546
Relax.

01:11:52.816 --> 01:11:54.109
This is really amazing.

01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:56.382
She's very charming.

01:11:56.853 --> 01:11:59.126
And hot, you didn't
say Ashleigh was hot.

01:11:59.276 --> 01:12:01.612
- I told you she was sexy.
- Is she older than you?

01:12:02.632 --> 01:12:03.550
She looks older.

01:12:04.914 --> 01:12:06.791
That's what you want,
a little experience.

01:12:08.561 --> 01:12:10.064
You have to grow up
and have a profession.

01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:12.738
You think a girl like that
wants to live hand to mouth.

01:12:13.464 --> 01:12:14.924
Funny you should
put it that way.

01:12:16.751 --> 01:12:18.920
Keep your hand on
the wheel, Ashleigh.

01:12:20.932 --> 01:12:23.120
He obviously wants
to go to bed with you.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.740
How do you feel about this?

01:12:29.055 --> 01:12:30.098
You have a boyfriend.

01:12:31.766 --> 01:12:32.683
Yes, but...

01:12:34.526 --> 01:12:36.110
This is Francisco Vega.

01:12:37.904 --> 01:12:40.113
Apart from him, being so sexy.

01:12:41.799 --> 01:12:43.486
He's an international icon.

01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:47.119
Mahatma Gandhi.

01:12:48.147 --> 01:12:49.273
How can you say no?

01:12:50.816 --> 01:12:52.818
This is the story you can
tell your grandchildren.

01:12:54.487 --> 01:12:55.696
May I show you upstairs?

01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:58.263
Sure.

01:12:58.592 --> 01:13:00.593
If you liked it here, you're
going to love it over there.

01:13:00.593 --> 01:13:01.781
Okay.

01:13:02.793 --> 01:13:04.031
I got us some whiskey.

01:13:06.788 --> 01:13:07.873
Is this where you sleep?

01:13:08.444 --> 01:13:09.599
Yeah,

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.266
when I sleep.

01:13:12.459 --> 01:13:15.871
You can see the whole apartment
from here, it's quite special.

01:13:15.871 --> 01:13:17.471
- Nice.
- Yeah, I know.

01:13:18.087 --> 01:13:19.005
I know.

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:30.523
Let me help you.

01:13:34.407 --> 01:13:35.575
Look at you.

01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:39.663
Who the hell is that?
Give me a sec.

01:13:40.901 --> 01:13:43.362
- Yes?
- It's Tiffany! I'm home!

01:13:44.609 --> 01:13:46.531
I thought you two
weren't together anymore.

01:13:46.531 --> 01:13:47.924
No, we...
Oh no!

01:13:48.747 --> 01:13:49.563
Wait a second.

01:13:50.315 --> 01:13:51.472
It's going to be fine.

01:13:52.206 --> 01:13:53.810
You said that you weren't
together anymore.

01:13:53.889 --> 01:13:54.859
Yeah, I know...

01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:56.761
You know what,
you have to hide there.

01:13:56.908 --> 01:13:58.135
Go behind that door.

01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:00.587
Go, she can't see you.
Go.

01:14:11.905 --> 01:14:14.491
- Surprise! Hi!
- What are you doing here?

01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:15.614
We wrapped 2 days early.

01:14:15.614 --> 01:14:17.944
I'm so glad you are home 
it's starting to pour.

01:14:18.531 --> 01:14:19.740
I just got off the plane.

01:14:21.465 --> 01:14:23.355
I bet you weren't
expecting me.

01:14:23.811 --> 01:14:25.099
I'm loving this.

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.403
Fransciso, why are you...
What are you doing running around?

01:14:30.781 --> 01:14:32.425
Getting ready for you.

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:39.509
Welcome back.

01:14:41.265 --> 01:14:44.268
I just got off the plane.
We wrapped 2 days early.

01:14:45.171 --> 01:14:48.591
I came right from airport.
I knew If I'm being surprise I'll arouse you.

01:14:52.194 --> 01:14:54.405
Baby. I've missed you.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:55.874
Yeah, me too.

01:14:55.874 --> 01:14:57.207
I've missed you too.

01:15:03.707 --> 01:15:04.582
What was that?

01:15:07.127 --> 01:15:09.862
- I didn't hear anything.
- I'm sure I heard something.

01:15:16.582 --> 01:15:17.594
- Baby.
- One sec.

01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:27.627
Come back, that was nothing.

01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:34.666
Excuse me, which
way the Waldorfl is?

01:16:37.079 --> 01:16:38.691
What's on your mind, mother?

01:16:43.193 --> 01:16:44.738
I want to have
a word with you.

01:16:44.915 --> 01:16:45.618
No, no.

01:16:45.618 --> 01:16:47.584
Please don't do this
to me tonight, mom.

01:16:47.718 --> 01:16:50.848
I'm not really in the mood for one of
your tete-a-tete's where I come out

01:16:50.848 --> 01:16:53.827
on the short end as always.
I really couldn't take it tonight.

01:16:53.945 --> 01:16:55.499
Okay?
Where is Ashleigh?

01:16:55.499 --> 01:16:58.479
- I asked her to leave.
- What? Why?

01:16:58.626 --> 01:17:00.670
Don't give me that
Ashleigh bullshit.

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:03.014
I smelled hooker the second
she walked through the door.

01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:04.797
Mother, do you
hear yourself?

01:17:05.424 --> 01:17:07.249
Damn right I hear myself.

01:17:07.728 --> 01:17:09.183
I'm shoked.

01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:13.003
Okay, I apologise.

01:17:14.303 --> 01:17:17.033
I met her in the bar at Carlyle
and I gave her five thousand bucks

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:19.984
to pretend she was Ashleigh,
who has dumped me.

01:17:19.984 --> 01:17:21.525
Five thousand?!

01:17:21.749 --> 01:17:25.127
It was worth that much for you
to make a fool of your father and me?

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.328
I was in a bad mood, it was
my idea of a joke.

01:17:28.328 --> 01:17:29.910
So it was a bad joke, okay?

01:17:30.075 --> 01:17:33.996
I won a lot in a card game, so...
It was an act of rebellion.

01:17:34.206 --> 01:17:37.251
- It was an act of hostility.
- Hostility and rebellion.

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.613
Rebellion against what?

01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:42.946
Private schools, a nice
home, summers in Europe?

01:17:43.113 --> 01:17:45.530
Against a life of pretentious
appropriateness:

01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:48.013
appropriate friends,
appropriate schools,

01:17:48.013 --> 01:17:51.515
appropriate women, that you
may or may not approve of.

01:17:52.142 --> 01:17:55.061
You resent me
because I set a high bar.

01:17:55.801 --> 01:17:57.830
Mother, I don't resent you
because you set a high bar.

01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.473
I just want you to see me.

01:17:59.619 --> 01:18:02.652
I'm never going to be like Hunter.
I'm not going to roll off the assembly line

01:18:02.652 --> 01:18:03.919
and make you proud.

01:18:04.151 --> 01:18:07.047
You lied to me when you said that
you were too busy to come to my party.

01:18:07.129 --> 01:18:10.399
That you were too busy at
work, snowed under at Yardley.

01:18:10.883 --> 01:18:14.213
I did lie to you, because I didn't
want to come to your party, alright?

01:18:14.213 --> 01:18:18.223
I wanted to spend the day with Ashleigh
in the city and have a great time.

01:18:18.223 --> 01:18:19.234
Where is Ashleigh?

01:18:19.265 --> 01:18:21.383
I told you she dumped me.
We became separated.

01:18:21.454 --> 01:18:23.135
This city has its own agenda.

01:18:23.313 --> 01:18:25.706
And your rage with 
me is so great

01:18:25.706 --> 01:18:28.426
that you express it by 
bringing home a whore?

01:18:28.426 --> 01:18:29.732
An escort, Mother.

01:18:30.123 --> 01:18:32.024
Let's not split pubic hairs.

01:18:32.345 --> 01:18:35.681
Anything to shake up that
collection of appropriate snobs.

01:18:36.265 --> 01:18:40.895
So you bring her to my gala as
your girlfriend to make a fool of me?

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.165
I'm sorry.

01:18:43.215 --> 01:18:44.130
I don't know why 
I'm like this.

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:47.125
I don't know where I get this perverse 
streak in my system from.

01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:48.189
I don't know.

01:18:49.254 --> 01:18:50.984
You get it from me.

01:18:51.657 --> 01:18:54.982
I get it from you,
the queen of good taste?

01:18:59.492 --> 01:19:00.368
Alright.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.994
You're a big enough boy to hear
the whole inappropriate story.

01:19:08.957 --> 01:19:10.208
I met your father,

01:19:13.086 --> 01:19:15.171
in the exact same 
line of work.

01:19:17.215 --> 01:19:18.508
An escort service.

01:19:20.467 --> 01:19:23.178
Or more to the point: hooking.

01:19:24.846 --> 01:19:28.892
As that working girl you
tried to slip pass us as Ashleigh Enright.

01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:31.840
What?

01:19:33.206 --> 01:19:34.540
Lower your eyebrows.

01:19:38.461 --> 01:19:40.582
I knocked on your 
father's hotel room door

01:19:40.582 --> 01:19:42.651
because that's how 
I made my living.

01:19:44.126 --> 01:19:45.503
Fresh from Gary, Indiana.

01:19:47.688 --> 01:19:53.735
Providing the lonely male of the
species with a little casual recreation.

01:19:55.181 --> 01:19:56.099
For a fee.

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:01.422
Except in you father's
case we fell in love.

01:20:03.696 --> 01:20:05.555
And not only do we marry.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:09.721
Winston used my hardened
nest egg to start the company

01:20:10.179 --> 01:20:13.766
that has enabled us to
live a pretty privileged life.

01:20:15.022 --> 01:20:17.858
You following?
Or am I going too fast?

01:20:20.319 --> 01:20:22.112
And I put myself
through school,

01:20:22.279 --> 01:20:26.408
so my brilliant young son
can laugh at my pretentious.

01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:36.215
What I'm saying is that, if I have
been to over too far in my pursuit

01:20:36.215 --> 01:20:40.541
of the finer things and
of cultivating an image.

01:20:41.923 --> 01:20:44.259
If I have caused
you some discomfort.

01:20:46.255 --> 01:20:49.569
It's only an overzealous 
ex-professional hustler

01:20:49.569 --> 01:20:52.273
from the mid west, 
trying to erradicate

01:20:53.568 --> 01:20:59.083
unsavory remnants of many hotel
rooms I still wake up screaming over.

01:21:00.278 --> 01:21:03.466
And if you can't understand
where you get your

01:21:03.466 --> 01:21:06.433
mysterious urge to consort
with a demi-monde.

01:21:08.656 --> 01:21:09.949
You have my genes.

01:21:13.781 --> 01:21:17.576
And I'm sorry to lay this X-rated tale
on my sweet college boy,

01:21:17.677 --> 01:21:20.814
but something tells
me that the time is right.

01:21:48.384 --> 01:21:51.178
Just put on the chairs and
then we done, alright?

01:21:52.763 --> 01:21:54.724
- Hey, Gatsby.
- Hey, Johnny.

01:22:43.104 --> 01:22:44.647
I saw you on television.

01:22:49.011 --> 01:22:50.047
Nothing happened.

01:22:51.445 --> 01:22:53.990
I'm really exhausted.
I've been walking forever.

01:22:54.532 --> 01:22:55.964
And then I got 
lost on the train.

01:22:55.964 --> 01:22:58.442
Ashleigh, you were
with a famous movie star.

01:22:59.061 --> 01:23:00.492
But nothing happened.

01:23:00.943 --> 01:23:02.163
I'd love to believe you.

01:23:04.915 --> 01:23:07.877
Just too many drinks,
too much weed.

01:23:09.025 --> 01:23:11.739
I'm just a little
too tired to explain.

01:23:12.474 --> 01:23:16.019
Tomorrow, I promise, but really
Gatsby, nothing happened.

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.435
Take off your rain coat, I'm going to
get you some black coffee.

01:23:22.739 --> 01:23:24.783
I can't, I have no 
clothes underneath.

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:31.965
So with Roland Pollard
it was like a spiritual thing.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:35.259
I was his muse, some 
inspiration because he's...

01:23:35.731 --> 01:23:38.150
Really going through a 
rough creative period.

01:23:38.818 --> 01:23:42.738
And also, my name is totally 
the same as his first wife's.

01:23:42.908 --> 01:23:46.119
Who also went to Yardley.
Who he's never really gotten over.

01:23:46.411 --> 01:23:47.990
And then Ted Davidoff.

01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:52.584
He was just absolutely traumatized 
by this affair his wife was having

01:23:52.584 --> 01:23:53.843
with his best friend.

01:23:53.912 --> 01:23:55.222
And there I was, you know.

01:23:55.355 --> 01:24:00.658
Just a person there to talk to, 
to hold his hand, during the crisis.

01:24:01.294 --> 01:24:02.629
What about Francisco Vega?

01:24:03.525 --> 01:24:05.777
Like James Dean, 
minus the acting chops?

01:24:05.937 --> 01:24:09.538
Francisco Vega was just after my body.
But I was onto him.

01:24:09.832 --> 01:24:12.230
And I have a terrific 
material for a hot story.

01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:13.447
I dated a hunk.

01:24:14.303 --> 01:24:15.513
What about you?

01:24:16.435 --> 01:24:18.645
How was going to 
your Mom's fahrey?

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:21.732
It was pretty nice, actually.

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:25.523
We got in a sort of a 
crazy conversation.

01:24:26.945 --> 01:24:29.943
For the first time in my life 
she surprised me in a good way.

01:24:31.214 --> 01:24:32.506
Now I feel closer to her.

01:24:34.028 --> 01:24:37.031
Must have been a big talk.
What did you discuss?

01:24:38.671 --> 01:24:40.048
The oldest profession.

01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:42.744
Journalism?

01:24:44.408 --> 01:24:45.826
That's the second oldest.

01:24:47.051 --> 01:24:49.887
Let's put it in this way, she's a 
lot more than I gave her credit for.

01:24:51.006 --> 01:24:52.132
I sold her short.

01:24:53.192 --> 01:24:55.778
What a shame we never 
got to take that carriage ride.

01:24:55.945 --> 01:24:57.260
We can still do it.

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:59.302
We have plenty of 
time, we can get it in.

01:24:59.839 --> 01:25:01.397
Said the John to my mom.

01:25:02.022 --> 01:25:03.985
- What?
- Nothing.

01:25:04.202 --> 01:25:06.204
We should probably leave 
our luggage downstairs.

01:25:06.627 --> 01:25:09.088
As you know I'd hate to 
miss our bus back to Yardley.

01:25:21.642 --> 01:25:23.227
New York on a misty day.

01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:27.564
I can't tell why it means something 
to me, but it means everything.

01:25:29.595 --> 01:25:32.139
It's only one carriage ride 
and the weather's gloomy.

01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:38.719
I couldn't really sleep last night.
Did you hear all those fire engines?

01:25:38.719 --> 01:25:39.682
I did.

01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:42.198
The roaring traffic's boom.

01:25:42.851 --> 01:25:44.871
Silence in my lonely room.

01:25:45.268 --> 01:25:48.397
I know that! That's from 
Shakespeare, right?

01:25:55.404 --> 01:25:56.696
Sir, would you stop 
for a second?

01:25:57.427 --> 01:26:00.222
- Why are we stoping?
- Ashleigh, you go back to Yardley.

01:26:00.632 --> 01:26:02.606
- I'm going to stay in New York.
- What?

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.909
I need a carbon 
monoxide to survive.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.913
- What are you talking about?
- We are two different creatures, right?

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:11.958
You like the sound of crickets 
and I like the rattle of the taxies.

01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:14.277
You blosom in 
the sun and me...

01:26:14.441 --> 01:26:16.281
I come into my 
own under grey skies.

01:26:16.843 --> 01:26:19.929
You were a big hit here, you 
are a crackerjack reporter.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.922
You were loved spiritually, emotionally and 
physically by 3 gifted men, right?

01:26:24.122 --> 01:26:25.402
- Yeah.
- You don't want to be with me.

01:26:25.402 --> 01:26:26.898
You deserve better than I am.

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:29.483
Are you dropping 
out of Yardley?

01:26:30.736 --> 01:26:32.219
If I won't sound 
to pretentious:

01:26:32.219 --> 01:26:33.931
I want to review
my other options.

01:26:33.931 --> 01:26:36.309
Excuse me, sir, do you think 
it's possible to take her to Pierre hotel?

01:26:36.792 --> 01:26:38.842
- Gatsby, I do not understand.
- You take this. Just take this.

01:26:39.177 --> 01:26:40.972
Get your luggage 
and return to Yardley.

01:26:41.994 --> 01:26:43.915
So you're not 
coming back to Yardley?

01:26:44.865 --> 01:26:47.119
I don't know Ash, I have to 
figure some stuff out of my life.

01:26:47.119 --> 01:26:49.997
Have a great trip and you tell 
everybody at Yardley I said goodbye.

01:26:50.164 --> 01:26:52.041
So you're not 
coming back to Yardley?

01:26:53.427 --> 01:26:54.735
Gatsby.

01:26:54.979 --> 01:26:56.609
Wait, sir, I'm...

01:26:57.784 --> 01:26:59.880
Gatsby, I don't understand.

01:27:09.263 --> 01:27:12.516
Could you hurry?
I think it's starting to rain.

01:28:49.427 --> 01:28:51.134
How did I know you'd be here.

01:28:51.134 --> 01:28:53.547
You didn't think I was going 
to blow this moment, did you?

01:28:53.547 --> 01:28:55.234
What about the skin doctor?

01:28:55.595 --> 01:29:00.090
Very handsome, very rich 
and very clever, but I'm here.

01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:03.164
For a kiss that was a 
maximum of an eight?

01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:06.858
It's fall.
By spring I'll have you up to 10.
