WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.160
Put that in his drink,
he'll lose this stupid wager,

00:04.160 --> 00:05.600
and all will be well with the world.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.680
I took a bribe to slow him down.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.280
The man said it would send him
to sleep for a day or two.

00:10.280 --> 00:13.080
You'd better hope it doesn't
put him to sleep forever.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.840
Please. Help him.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.520
You really don't remember anything?

00:16.520 --> 00:18.520
No, just some dreams.
Did I say anything?

00:18.520 --> 00:22.960
Estella,
my darling Estella, you came back.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.440
No. Nothing.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.840
I think they were meant
to travel the world together,

00:26.840 --> 00:29.480
but she ended their relationship
and went off on her own.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.920
We're here
because a woman broke his heart.

00:31.920 --> 00:35.600
To have lived the rest of his life
without the woman he loves -

00:35.600 --> 00:38.920
knowing she's out there, and
knowing he'll never see her again.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.920
I'm sick of being the famous
Mr Fortescue's daughter.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.720
I'm going to be a proper writer.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.520
CLOCK CHIMES

00:52.520 --> 00:53.560
OFFICE CHATTER

01:05.200 --> 01:06.720
Still on Calcutta time.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.480
Not bad for 750 rupees.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.040
All right, I will get us some money,
book a hotel for the night

01:14.040 --> 01:16.880
and purchase our onward
tickets to Yokohama.

01:19.080 --> 01:23.240
Look at him,
like a seal returning to the sea.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.920
I've rather missed filling out
forms.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.120
I think I saw that money
order, Mr Fogg.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.600
I'll just go
and check with my manager.Splendid.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.920
Mr Fogg's money order.

01:40.280 --> 01:46.080
Order. Structure. Civility. I think
we're all going to like Hong Kong.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.720
But, first, I'm going to
powder my nose.

01:55.520 --> 02:00.680
I was mistaken, Mr Fogg, no circular
note has come in for you.

02:01.720 --> 02:06.120
Really? I sent a telegram
from Calcutta to my bank in London.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.880
BACKGROUND: Much obliged.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.840
They assured me they would
communicate with you directly.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.680
Perhaps you would like to contact
your bank.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.640
What the hell are you doing here?

02:15.640 --> 02:18.840
You told me the seeds would slow him
down - they nearly killed him!

02:18.840 --> 02:20.960
Take your debt.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.760
As I say, I can find no
record of any such communication.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.160
Have you heard the expression,

02:28.160 --> 02:30.480
"If you want something doing,
do it yourself"?

02:33.120 --> 02:35.760
The man's name is Fogg,
career criminal,

02:35.760 --> 02:39.360
masquerading as a gentleman -
fraud, embezzlement, theft.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.600
Whatever you do,
don't give him any money.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.040
Without money,
he can't leave Hong Kong.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.120
When the warrant arrives,
I will arrest him

02:47.120 --> 02:50.120
and I'll make sure your name is
mentioned in the highest of places.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.120
The highest of places.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.080
Well, this is somewhat irregular,

02:56.080 --> 02:58.680
but I would do my duty, of course,
Inspector.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.520
Lovely day, Monsieur.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.920
I have hotel rooms to pay for,
onward tickets to buy.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.600
You'll just have to advance me
some money on account.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.920
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.800
As soon as I hear from London,
the money will be available to you.

03:29.680 --> 03:33.320
Tiny fly in the ointment - no money
until they've heard from my bank.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.600
Until then, we'll have to rely on my
wits to find us food and lodgings.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.600
I'm not a fussy woman,
as you both know,

03:40.600 --> 03:43.800
but can we please find a hotel with
a bath the size of Shropshire?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.280
Shropshire?

03:46.680 --> 03:50.520
Erm, do you want to break it to her,
Passepartout, or shall I?

03:50.520 --> 03:51.760
Break what to me?

04:42.160 --> 04:45.480
Hong Kong. The commercial heart
of the Orient

04:45.480 --> 04:47.400
and I don't have two pennies to rub
together.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.240
I know a place,
it won't cost anything.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.640
You've been here before?
Did you know this, Mr Fogg?

04:54.680 --> 04:57.240
Passepartout is
a man of endless mystery.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.840
That's one word for it.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.160
Mr Fogg?Yes.

05:01.120 --> 05:06.520
Mr Phileas Fogg?Hello.
I am your biggest admirer.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.400
Oh. Oh, and yours, Miss Fix.

05:09.400 --> 05:14.320
Mr Fogg was already
the talk of the colony, but then...

05:18.560 --> 05:21.840
Forgive me,
I am Lady Clemency Rowbotham,

05:21.840 --> 05:24.360
my husband is
the Governor of Hong Kong.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.640
Charmed, Lady Clemency.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.320
Have you ever met an actual
Governor before?

05:29.600 --> 05:32.080
I don't believe I have.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.080
Then come and meet mine!

05:34.080 --> 05:35.400
Henry!

05:37.920 --> 05:40.600
I want you to meet some
new friends of mine.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.720
Must I?

05:41.720 --> 05:44.040
I have a meeting in ten
minutes about the Jockey Club.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.320
Please, darling, for me.

05:48.200 --> 05:53.960
This is the great Phileas Fogg,
explorer and English lionheart.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.320
Miss Abigail Fix, his chronicler.
And his manservant...

06:01.760 --> 06:03.280
..Passport.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.400
He's the chap you've been
going on about? Uh-huh.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.520
On behalf of Her Majesty's
administration,

06:09.520 --> 06:12.360
a wholehearted welcome
to our humble colony.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.720
Are you shopping or playing bridge?

06:17.720 --> 06:21.160
Neither. I shall be arranging
the garden party, of course.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.760
What garden party?

06:23.760 --> 06:25.880
The one you are throwing
for the intrepid Mr Fogg

06:25.880 --> 06:27.680
and his friends.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.880
Just imagine how delighted they'll
be in Whitehall

06:29.880 --> 06:34.080
when they hear that you've
entertained England's latest hero.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.240
Yes, yes, of course, Mr Fogg!

06:37.240 --> 06:39.800
You shall indeed
be my guest of honour.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.760
Well, how splendid!

06:44.760 --> 06:46.320
Well done.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.200
LOUD CLAMOUR

07:06.040 --> 07:07.840
Where exactly are you taking us?

07:07.840 --> 07:10.040
I have an old friend
who runs a hotel here.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.600
Why didn't you say you've
been in Hong Kong before?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.320
It was in another life.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.720
But what were you doing here?

07:15.720 --> 07:17.680
I was on a ship that
put in for repairs.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.280
You were a sailor? When I arrived.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.840
And when you left?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.960
I was...no longer a sailor.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.400
You really can be an extremely
infuriating man.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.640
Are we there yet? Soon!

07:41.480 --> 07:43.480
We have somewhere to stay.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.320
This is it?

07:51.320 --> 07:54.480
This is it, Monsieur.
Choosers cannot also be mendicants.

07:54.480 --> 07:59.160
Beggars. Um...I think
two bedrooms were mentioned?

08:04.920 --> 08:06.360
Lovely.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.400
Indeed it is. Cosy. Authentic.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.400
Thank you very much, thank you.
Well done, Passepartout.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.840
Erm, erm...

08:15.840 --> 08:18.800
I think I'll go back to the bank
and hound that clerk

08:18.800 --> 08:20.360
until he hands over the money.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.400
My money, so...

08:22.400 --> 08:24.040
Very good.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.040
A bientot.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.760
Where are you going?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.360
To see an old friend.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.680
You stay here, Miss Fix,
you'll be quite safe.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.400
What are you doing following me?

09:18.400 --> 09:20.800
Interesting things happen
when I follow you.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.440
You really can be
an infuriating woman.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.600
Don't want me
to meet this "friend" of yours?

09:25.600 --> 09:27.480
No, I don't.
Geisha, is she?

09:27.480 --> 09:29.280
Not unless I'm walking to Japan.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.280
Oh. My. Giddy. Aunt.
What is it?

09:31.280 --> 09:33.360
My article!

09:33.360 --> 09:36.640
My father printed it.
Printed it and syndicated it!

09:36.640 --> 09:39.360
Why are you so excited?
He always prints your articles.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.360
Not like this.

09:42.360 --> 09:45.960
He's never printed anything
like this before in his life.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.920
"I hope not only that he meets his
own ambition,

09:48.920 --> 09:52.120
"but that he finds solace in our
extraordinary adventure."

09:57.400 --> 09:59.800
What do you think?
Be completely honest.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.120
Unless you hate it, of course,
in which case please lie profusely.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.560
I think it's engaging.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.400
Thought-provoking.
Very well-written.

10:09.400 --> 10:13.000
It makes me see Fogg in a different
way, a more complex way.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.600
I can hear your voice in it.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.160
Thank you, Passepartout.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.960
I would advise you to destroy
every copy in Hong Kong.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.240
What do you mean?

10:21.240 --> 10:23.840
He is the most private man
I have ever known.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.040
To have his innermost secrets
read by friends and strangers...

10:28.720 --> 10:33.320
"This venture may prove to be a
voyage to heal a broken heart.

10:33.320 --> 10:37.440
"His yearning is less for escapades,
than for escape."

10:37.440 --> 10:40.360
I haven't written anything that
isn't the truth.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.720
Exactly.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.480
He's going to hate me, isn't he?

11:13.520 --> 11:16.080
Depositors - that's me -
give the bank - that's you -

11:16.080 --> 11:17.720
their money to look after

11:17.720 --> 11:19.760
and to lend to other
people at a rate of interest.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.160
A percentage of that interest comes
back to the depositor,

11:22.160 --> 11:23.640
everybody is very happy.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.280
Please, Mr Fogg, your circular note
has not yet arrived.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.840
Now, if you'd move aside...

11:27.840 --> 11:31.080
But sometimes the said
depositor - again, me - wants to

11:31.080 --> 11:34.800
take some of their money out.
Their money. Are you following me?

11:34.800 --> 11:37.880
That time is now. I...

11:37.880 --> 11:42.560
As my colleague has informed you,
Mr Fogg, no circular note, no funds.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.320
No exceptions.

11:45.560 --> 11:50.320
Well, I shall just have to ask
my friend the Governor for a loan,

11:50.320 --> 11:53.160
at the party he is throwing for me
this very day.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.080
And when he asks me why I couldn't
just get my own money,

11:56.080 --> 11:57.600
from my own bank...

11:57.600 --> 11:59.560
..I shall tell him.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.720
As soon as we have money,

12:06.720 --> 12:09.160
we can get him out of Hong Kong
before he reads it.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.400
Working on it, Miss Fix.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.120
I'm going back here to see my old
friend for a private conversation.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.160
A private conversation that
you do not need to hear,

12:20.160 --> 12:23.440
you do not make notes on, you do not
publish in a national newspaper.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.960
Is that clear?
As clear as day.

12:28.560 --> 12:32.720
Ironically, the best in Hong Kong.
Do not move.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.800
The article will be widely read
and people will applaud him.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.880
For the first time in his life,
he will be truly lauded.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.800
He will thank me.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.720
LOUD BANGING

13:26.920 --> 13:29.440
DOOR SHUTS AND LOCKS

13:42.760 --> 13:45.120
I also hear you've been busy.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.640
Travelling with the famous
adventurer, Phileas Fogg.

13:47.640 --> 13:52.040
I am. However, we find ourselves
delayed by a lack of funds.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.000
You've come to me for money?

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
A loan only -
to pay for passage to Yokohama.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.200
It would be repaid in a matter
of days.

14:04.080 --> 14:07.360
Your master dines with the Governor
today, I understand.

14:09.400 --> 14:14.800
His wife, Lady Clemency, is in
possession of a magnificent jewel.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.640
The White Dragon.

14:16.640 --> 14:20.440
Carved out of rare white jade
in the Shang Dynasty,

14:20.440 --> 14:23.920
when the British were still
living in huts.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.880
They stole it from my ancestors'
grave.

14:26.880 --> 14:30.040
It was wrapped around their fingers,
and still they took it.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.880
Why are you telling me this?

14:34.160 --> 14:35.520
Because you, my friend...

14:37.200 --> 14:39.480
..are going to steal it back for me.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.800
You know me as a thief,
Jiang Liei...

14:57.800 --> 15:01.240
Not a thief, Passepartout!
A great thief.

15:02.240 --> 15:05.080
That way of life is behind me now.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.200
If you want to steal the jewel,
steal it yourself.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.280
Do you think I haven't tried?

15:09.280 --> 15:13.160
Strangely, Chinese entrepreneurs are
not invited to Government House.

15:13.160 --> 15:14.840
I've tried without an invite,

15:14.840 --> 15:17.640
but the place is as secure
as the Tower of London.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.600
I need money but I will not steal.
Not any more.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.440
Then you are of no use to me.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.400
And a man that is of no use to me...

15:30.680 --> 15:32.280
RAISED VOICES OUTSIDE

15:32.280 --> 15:34.440
DOOR BANGS

15:34.440 --> 15:36.840
How can one of the oldest
civilisations on Earth not

15:36.840 --> 15:38.240
have invented the fork yet?

15:39.800 --> 15:42.120
Oh, hello.
You must be Passepartout's friend.

15:42.120 --> 15:45.320
And you must be Miss Abigail Fix,
the celebrated journalist.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.120
Yes, the one who was told to wait
outside.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.840
You're far too kind.
We must go.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.600
Of course! You must not
let the Governor wait.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.960
It was so nice to meet an old
friend of Passepartout's.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.560
The pleasure was all mine, Miss Fix.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.920
Will I see you again before you
leave, old friend?

16:01.920 --> 16:04.120
No, I don't think you will.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.040
Hong Kong can be a dangerous place
for unwary travellers.

16:08.160 --> 16:12.080
Look after yourself, Passepartout.
And look after Miss Fix.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.240
So, according to Abigail, Fogg has
kept a candle burning for that

16:31.240 --> 16:33.360
ridiculous woman for over 20 years!

16:36.160 --> 16:40.440
Why would you even print this?
There are no facts or figures.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.760
It's just...rot.

16:41.760 --> 16:45.320
I actually think it might be
a new sort of writing - thoughtful,

16:45.320 --> 16:48.640
questioning, and
unapologetically subjective.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.600
It's a new kind of rot.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.120
I think your daughter's written
a very fine article, Fortescue.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.640
Romantic.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.680
What you know about romance,
Fellentin, could be

16:57.680 --> 16:59.240
written on a grain of sand.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.360
Thank you, Fellentin,
that means a lot.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.680
"Underneath that reserve and routine
is a kind, perhaps brilliant

17:08.680 --> 17:11.800
"man who many years ago was
disappointed by the love of a young

17:11.800 --> 17:15.720
"woman, the mysterious Estella, and
has yet remained faithful to it."

17:15.720 --> 17:18.440
You do realise that Fogg is going to
blow his brains out

17:18.440 --> 17:21.000
with embarrassment when he reads
this, don't you?

17:26.720 --> 17:27.960
I hope this is going to work,

17:27.960 --> 17:31.440
Passepartout, I have to
look at my absolute best.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.200
One thing you should know
about the English upper classes -

17:34.200 --> 17:36.000
if you look like a man who needs
money,

17:36.000 --> 17:37.840
they'll never give you a penny.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.600
Look like a man who doesn't,
and they'll throw the stuff at you.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.080
It is ingenious.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.960
Yes?

17:45.960 --> 17:47.800
How are you doing in there,
Miss Fix?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.600
We can't keep the Governor waiting.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.840
It's too much, isn't it?

17:52.840 --> 17:55.760
Absolutely not! No.
Tell her, Passepartout.

17:56.960 --> 18:00.120
Like a diamond in front
of some pigs.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.360
Pearls before swine, Passepartout.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.920
Right. I shall get dressed
and then we can go to my party.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.560
Get ourselves a loan.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.440
Look at the security -
it's like Buckingham Palace.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.360
Stop there, please.
Now, once we're in,

18:19.360 --> 18:21.440
let me do the talking.
Oui, monsieur.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.760
Your articles certainly get us into
the best places, Miss Fix.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.120
Still, let's make this as quick as
we can.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.840
Let's just stay for one drink, OK?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.560
QUIET CONVERSATIONS

18:58.560 --> 19:01.000
Ladies and gentlemen, they're here.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.440
APPLAUSE

19:03.440 --> 19:06.160
Thank you, thank you so much.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.320
Mr Fogg, Miss Fix.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.480
Passport.

19:11.720 --> 19:15.840
Miss Fix, may I say
how spectacular you look?

19:15.840 --> 19:18.800
That must be one of the saris
from the Indian village.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.000
It is, yes.
How do you know about...?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.120
On behalf of Her Majesty's
administration,

19:23.120 --> 19:26.120
a wholehearted welcome
to our humble colony.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.280
For God's sake, Henry,
you've done that bit.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.560
He has the memory of a senile
turbot, I do apologise.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.920
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr Fogg.
We can't wait to hear your stories.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.480
Thank you.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.680
This is Peter Donaldson,
of the Hong Kong police.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.640
And Lord Crossley, Chief Magistrate.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.720
Thank you, Sir Henry, this really is
terribly kind of you.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.560
I'm afraid you'll have to start with
the men, Mr Fogg,

19:51.560 --> 19:54.720
which means you'll have to listen
to my husband talk about horses,

19:54.720 --> 19:57.120
public houses and cheese.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.520
Please, call me Phileas.

19:59.520 --> 20:03.000
But we ladies will get our piece
of flesh later, don't you fear.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.560
She's read the article! I'm doomed.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.880
A votre sante.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.160
I wouldn't knowingly hurt that
man for the world.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.400
We get the money

20:34.400 --> 20:37.400
and we get Fogg out of here before
he reads your article.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.200
Thank you, Passepartout.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.160
And then India?

20:44.160 --> 20:45.640
Indeed, yes.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.640
Ghastly place, so I'm told.
Oh, no.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.320
But the bank in Calcutta did
spectacularly fail to do what

20:51.320 --> 20:53.160
they said they were going to do.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.840
And talking of banks...

20:54.840 --> 20:57.680
Good God, Anderson, have you joined
the Temperance Society?

20:57.680 --> 20:59.560
Come back with the jug, man.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.520
What I thought was remarkable
about this piece, Miss Fix,

21:02.520 --> 21:06.760
was not so much that Mr Fogg had
undertaken this

21:06.760 --> 21:08.720
journey for unrequited love...

21:08.720 --> 21:12.200
Although we did very much
like that bit.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.720
What I found astonishing,
and just so moving,

21:15.720 --> 21:19.800
was that he entrusted you
to tell his story to the world.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.960
PHILEAS: ..Japan, which I'm very
much looking forward to,

21:23.960 --> 21:25.680
the United States of America

21:25.680 --> 21:29.520
and then, hopefully, back to London
in time for Christmas.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.400
London at Christmas.
I hope you do it, Fogg.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.680
Imagine the faces of the French
and Germans

21:34.680 --> 21:37.840
when they hear another Briton
got there first!

21:37.840 --> 21:40.320
Where are you
staying in Hong Kong, Fogg?

21:42.120 --> 21:43.360
Passepartout...!

21:45.680 --> 21:47.880
You were
a waiter at the Reform Club!

21:47.880 --> 21:50.920
Me, monsieur? Are you sure?

21:50.920 --> 21:53.080
More of a White's man, myself.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.440
Father always said the Reform
were a bunch of radicals.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.040
Radicals?

21:57.040 --> 21:59.720
We'll talk about this later,
Passepartout.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.280
I asked where you're staying,
Fogg.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.000
Ah, therein lies a story.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.280
I went to the bank this morning

22:05.280 --> 22:08.080
and there had been some
sort of mix-up with London.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.240
Words I could have
carved on my gravestone.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.400
So I find myself -
through no fault of my own -

22:12.400 --> 22:14.080
somewhat fiscally embarrassed.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.600
Now, my man found us

22:15.600 --> 22:18.040
some extremely modest
accommodation in a place called...

22:18.040 --> 22:19.440
..um...what's it called?

22:19.440 --> 22:21.520
Tai Ping Shan, monsieur.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.120
Tai Ping Shan? Good God, man!

22:24.120 --> 22:26.520
That's like spending
a night in Bethnal Green.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.760
I'll loan you the money, Fogg,
that's all there is to it.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.320
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.040
You have no choice in the matter.

22:32.040 --> 22:35.720
Anderson, Anderson! Go to the house
and fetch a money order.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.200
I will help him.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.440
Shall we go and
rescue your Mr Fogg?

22:41.440 --> 22:44.320
I think he's more than happy
talking to your husband.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.080
I don't think anyone has ever said
that sentence before.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.280
Oh, too cruel, Clemency!

22:51.000 --> 22:55.800
My husband is a good man. A loyal
and kind man, in his own ways.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.800
But he hasn't got a romantic
bone in his body.

23:01.120 --> 23:04.400
Now, the Dove down by the Thames
in Hammersmith does an excellent

23:04.400 --> 23:07.120
ale, a very passable
bit of Blue Vinny

23:07.120 --> 23:11.920
and has a barmaid called Gwen,
who has dimples!

23:13.200 --> 23:15.520
Your money order, sir.What?

23:15.520 --> 23:16.800
One money order. One pen.

23:18.120 --> 23:23.200
I don't think they can serve
Empire and Eros at the same time.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.480
Let's go and talk to Mr Fogg.
Shall we?

23:26.480 --> 23:28.520
How much do you want, Fogg?

23:28.520 --> 23:30.160
This is very kind of you, Sir Henry.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.920
The chap who wrote Rule Britannia
used to drink in The Dove,

23:32.920 --> 23:34.880
not a lot of people know that.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.520
No, well, a night in a half-decent
hotel,

23:37.520 --> 23:39.600
three onward tickets to
Japan, I suppose...

23:39.600 --> 23:41.480
# The nations,
not so blessed as thee

23:41.480 --> 23:44.880
# Must in their turn to tyrants
fall... #

23:44.880 --> 23:49.080
HE MUTTERS LYRICS

23:53.480 --> 23:55.320
I trust the pen has ink, monsieur?

23:55.320 --> 23:56.840
Yes, yes!

23:59.160 --> 24:02.840
Mr Fogg?Yes?
The ladies require your presence.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.640
Yes, of course.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.000
It's absolutely superb,
Lady Clemency.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.240
When they were digging
the foundations for this house,

24:19.240 --> 24:21.440
they found it in a grave.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.960
It's
the White Dragon of Hong Kong.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.400
So, who are you backing this season,
old chap?

24:27.400 --> 24:29.360
Wouldn't you like to know, Crossley.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.520
Tell me about that young colt you've
just bought.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.720
Well, I was hoping we might break it
in this spring,

24:33.720 --> 24:36.560
but then the trainer tells me the
beast is a warm blighter.

24:37.720 --> 24:40.720
When they opened up the grave,
they found the skeletons of a man

24:40.720 --> 24:42.320
and a woman.

24:42.320 --> 24:45.800
Even after all these centuries,
they were still holding hands.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.520
How extraordinary.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.160
Would you mind, Mr Fogg?

24:50.160 --> 24:52.120
Yes, of course.

24:54.520 --> 24:59.000
That puts even your fidelity
into perspective, Phileas.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.880
Let me show you the pergola.

25:11.200 --> 25:14.440
If you could just sign this,
Sir Henry, we will be on our way

25:14.440 --> 25:16.960
and out of your hair.

25:16.960 --> 25:19.080
God! You listen to this.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.880
Every woman here would love to be me
at this moment,

25:23.880 --> 25:27.560
on the arm of a man who knows
the power of love.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.520
"At first I believed Mr Fogg to be
a new kind of Victorian adventurer,

25:32.520 --> 25:35.760
"grasping at achievement. The truth,
however, is that what drives

25:35.760 --> 25:38.280
"Mr Fogg is less ambition than
heartbreak."

25:39.920 --> 25:43.040
But every woman here knows
she doesn't stand a chance,

25:43.040 --> 25:46.840
that your heart is elsewhere
and it always will be.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.360
Heartbreak?

25:48.360 --> 25:49.640
Let me see that, Donaldson.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.600
Indeed? Where would that be?

25:55.760 --> 25:58.440
With Estella, of course.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.120
DRAMATIC SCORE

26:02.360 --> 26:04.760
She's told him - I'm lost.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.120
If you could just sign this, sir.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.760
Would you go away?!

26:14.160 --> 26:16.360
How do you know about that...lady?

26:16.360 --> 26:19.320
I read Miss Fix's article,
like everyone else here.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.120
I suppose we really should think
of making a move - big day tomorrow.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.480
What article?

26:28.960 --> 26:30.360
You really don't know?

26:30.360 --> 26:31.960
Would you care to hear it, Fogg?

26:33.160 --> 26:35.440
I was going to tell you.

26:35.440 --> 26:38.360
It's just words on a page, monsieur,
nothing more.

26:38.360 --> 26:41.720
"Underneath that reserve and routine
is a kind, perhaps brilliant

26:41.720 --> 26:44.800
"man who many years ago was
disappointed by the love of a

26:44.800 --> 26:47.960
"young woman, the mysterious
Estella...

26:49.000 --> 26:51.600
"..and has yet remained
faithful to it."

26:53.360 --> 26:55.320
May I?

26:55.320 --> 26:57.800
She stitched you up like a kipper,
Fogg.

27:17.840 --> 27:18.960
Indeed she has.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.440
Miss Fix is quite right,

27:21.440 --> 27:23.960
we have a lot to do before we sail
for Yokohama in the morning.

27:23.960 --> 27:26.200
Thank you for your hospitality.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.640
Where is Passepartout?
He was just here. Passepartout?

27:28.640 --> 27:30.160
Does he know about this too?
Mm-hm.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.440
Then he can walk home.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.560
We have offended you.
I'm mortified!

27:34.560 --> 27:37.960
Cheerio, Fogg. Haven't enjoyed
one of these so much in ages.

27:37.960 --> 27:43.600
Oh, shut up, Henry! Phileas,
please, don't go like this!

27:43.600 --> 27:45.280
Goodbye, Lady Clemency.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.640
Please, let me explain.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.120
I have been humiliated by masters of
their trade, Miss Fix,

28:00.120 --> 28:02.680
yours are the dizzy,
dizzy heights of betrayal.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.040
But every word is true!

28:04.040 --> 28:05.640
Every word is private!

28:05.640 --> 28:07.080
You took my innermost feelings,

28:07.080 --> 28:08.960
feelings you tricked
and stole from me...

28:08.960 --> 28:10.720
I didn't steal!
..and you offer them

28:10.720 --> 28:14.120
up to the world without having
the decency to even tell me first.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.080
I was waiting for the right moment.

28:16.080 --> 28:19.880
Oh, is Government House in Hong Kong
right enough for you?

28:19.880 --> 28:21.960
After what we'd been
through in Yemen and India,

28:21.960 --> 28:23.920
I thought you were my friend.
I AM your friend!

28:23.920 --> 28:25.360
You do know your father and Bellamy

28:25.360 --> 28:27.760
and the rest will be having a jolly
good laugh about this?

28:27.760 --> 28:29.200
I am sure they will do no
such thing.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.040
Well, then you know even less about
the world than I thought you did.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.720
Lady Clemency read it and she...

28:33.720 --> 28:35.720
Don't speak to me,
don't even look at me.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.840

34:15.440 --> 34:18.640
A fraudster and, by all accounts,
a thief to boot.

34:18.640 --> 34:21.640
Just the thought of such a man being
a guest in your house, Sir Henry.

34:21.640 --> 34:24.120
I know I gave the detective my word
but...

34:24.120 --> 34:25.680
Where is this detective?

34:25.680 --> 34:29.200
Lying low and waiting for his arrest
warrant, no doubt.

34:29.200 --> 34:34.280
Well, Fogg got no money out of me,
though he tried hard enough.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.680
Henry! Henry!

34:36.680 --> 34:38.480
What on Earth's the matter?

34:41.600 --> 34:44.160
The White Dragon. It's gone!

34:53.200 --> 34:55.120
How many times do I have to say it?

34:55.120 --> 34:57.480
I should have consulted
you before I sent the article...

34:57.480 --> 34:59.880
Stow our bags on the Carnatic,
Passepartout. I'll go to the

34:59.880 --> 35:01.720
bank and get the money
and buy the tickets.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.480
..but it's not MY fault
if the truth hurts.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.760
With a bit of luck, they'll only
have two berths left.

35:05.760 --> 35:08.320
If you sign me a chit,
monsieur, I can go to the bank

35:08.320 --> 35:10.080
and get your money.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.720
Oh, yes, but can you be trusted,
Passepartout?

35:12.720 --> 35:15.720
When I interviewed you in London,
I distinctly remember asking

35:15.720 --> 35:18.560
if we'd met before.
It was a just little lie, monsieur.

35:18.560 --> 35:21.480
Yes, well, the trouble with little
lies is that they rapidly become

35:21.480 --> 35:22.720
bigger lies...

35:23.960 --> 35:27.120
Donaldson? What on Earth is
the meaning of this?

35:27.120 --> 35:30.000
This is a warrant for your arrest.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.200
My arrest?

35:32.200 --> 35:33.400
How dare you!

35:33.400 --> 35:35.760
I will speak to the Governor
about this! It's an outrage!

35:35.760 --> 35:37.560
And I will write about it
in the Telegraph!

35:37.560 --> 35:40.240
I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.800
Where is it?

35:41.800 --> 35:43.240
Where is what?

35:43.240 --> 35:44.880
The White Dragon.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.600
I have no idea!
Sir...

35:51.880 --> 35:55.320
Yesterday, you said you had no
money.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.840
I didn't! I don't!

35:57.840 --> 36:00.560
You've sold the White Dragon
already?

36:02.200 --> 36:05.360
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.800
For God's sake, Rowbotham!
I haven't stolen anything!

36:16.800 --> 36:19.360
You will rue the day you
made my wife cry, sir.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.720
I am not a thief!

36:20.720 --> 36:23.120
You are making the most terrible
mistake!Do you hear me?

36:23.120 --> 36:25.440
I don't care about losing the wager
but I AM NOT A THIEF!

36:25.440 --> 36:27.320
We'll get you out, Mr Fogg!
I promise!

36:28.840 --> 36:30.520
Passepartout...

36:32.560 --> 36:35.400
What is going on? Tell me!

36:35.400 --> 36:37.400
I want to see Jiang Liei, now!

36:37.400 --> 36:39.680
What has this got to do with...?
JIANG LIEI!

36:46.680 --> 36:49.880
You will tell me what is going on,
and you will tell me now.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.640
Hmm...

37:29.880 --> 37:33.360
One more time, Fogg -
who did you sell it to?

37:33.360 --> 37:36.200
I have told you.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.040
The last time I saw
the White Dragon,

37:38.040 --> 37:39.920
it was around Lady Clemency's neck.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.640
If you think I won't flog you,
you are very much mistaken.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.480
Flog me?
Flog.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.680
I am entitled to a trial.
I am an Englishman.

37:52.680 --> 37:54.320
This is not England.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.880
This is Hong Kong.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.840
You stole the White Dragon?

38:07.840 --> 38:09.480
Keep your voice down.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.160
You stole it and let Mr Fogg take
the blame? It's not what it seems.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.120
You heard what they said!
He's going to prison!

38:14.120 --> 38:15.600
Argh!

38:15.600 --> 38:17.560
Why would you do such
a shameful thing?

38:17.560 --> 38:20.360
Because we needed money to buy
the tickets to get to Japan.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.520
And because I am a great thief.
I don't believe you.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.120
Jiang Liei said he would give me
money

38:24.120 --> 38:27.120
if I stole the pendant for him.
I thought we would be on the ship

38:27.120 --> 38:30.520
and away from here before anybody
even noticed it had gone missing.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.400
They're not going to send him
to prison.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.440
Oh, thank God!

38:39.640 --> 38:42.000
They are going to flog him at noon.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.600
12 strokes at 12 noon.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.240
I'll go to the bank,
his money might be here by now.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.720
It won't be there and, if it was,
they wouldn't give it to you.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.240
Then I'll wire my father.
There isn't time.

39:27.240 --> 39:30.520
Then what do you suggest?
You got us into this mess!

39:30.520 --> 39:33.280
I'll tell Sir Henry I stole
the White Dragon,

39:33.280 --> 39:34.760
it had nothing to do with Fogg.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.240
And then what?

39:36.240 --> 39:38.600
They'll arrest you
and make an example of you.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.000
And it won't be a few lashes.

39:46.640 --> 39:49.040
DOOR OPENS

39:59.280 --> 40:03.400
Mr Fogg hates me at the moment, and
for all I know may hate me forever.

40:03.400 --> 40:07.400
But he is as far from being
a thief as any man I have ever met.

40:08.880 --> 40:12.840
To have him flogged for something
he didn't do would be barbaric.

40:14.320 --> 40:18.360
He is a hero, whatever you may
think, and he does not deserve

40:18.360 --> 40:21.760
to be beaten for something
he did not do and would never do.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.160
Have you finished?

40:25.680 --> 40:27.440
Good.
Now, get out.

40:27.440 --> 40:28.640
Go on, Miss Fix.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.960
Clemency. There's no need to upset
yourself further...

40:33.960 --> 40:36.720
Many years ago, Phileas Fogg
made a mistake.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.600
He followed duty and expectation,
when he should have followed love.

40:41.600 --> 40:45.320
But he had the courage to realise
the folly of that mistake,

40:45.320 --> 40:47.760
to undertake this
extraordinary journey,

40:47.760 --> 40:51.680
to prove to himself that dreams can
sometimes defeat expectations.

40:52.840 --> 40:56.200
He still stole the White Dragon,
and that's the end of it.

40:56.200 --> 40:59.360
He didn't steal it. I did.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.080
Passepartout...

41:01.080 --> 41:04.520
I wasn't prepared to
let his dream end here.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.720
I stole it and sold it.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.840
Sold it to the family it once
belonged to.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.000
I'm sorry, madame.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.600
Then you will rot in prison.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.920
No, I beg you!
He made a mistake, but only...

41:15.920 --> 41:19.680
I gave the White Dragon to my wife
as a token of my deep love

41:19.680 --> 41:21.720
and respect for her.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.480
And you come into my house...

41:32.000 --> 41:33.520
Henry...

41:37.760 --> 41:41.080
I know you follow me
around the world without complaint.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.880
I know it's a life of restraint
and duty.

41:46.000 --> 41:51.320
I never had much in the way of words
to give you, Clemmie...

41:51.320 --> 41:53.160
..but I had the White Dragon.

41:55.720 --> 41:58.520
Let Phileas Fogg go, Henry.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.280
But your dragon...

42:01.680 --> 42:04.560
I never wanted to hurt your
feelings,

42:04.560 --> 42:07.320
but I've never really felt
comfortable wearing it.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.160
It wasn't my love story.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.040
And besides...

42:17.960 --> 42:19.440
..I have my own.

flogging, Donaldson.

44:03.280 --> 44:06.400
Try to keep the crease,
there's a good chap.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.680
You think this is funny, Fogg?

44:09.760 --> 44:11.440
Not in the slightest.

44:11.440 --> 44:14.120
There is nothing funny about being
flogged for something you know

you didn't do.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.160

Thank you.
I'm going to my cabin.

46:25.840 --> 46:27.240
I'll unpack for you, monsieur.

46:27.240 --> 46:28.680
No, thank you.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.000
A refreshing drink?

46:30.000 --> 46:32.160
I won't need either of you
until further notice.

46:32.160 --> 46:33.680
I want to be on my own.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.240
I should have said I was sorry.

46:41.400 --> 46:43.040
I should have told him the truth.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.560
Not so secret now, Estella.

47:05.040 --> 47:07.000
May I join you?

47:12.680 --> 47:15.600
Have you ever heard the expression,
"If you want something doing,

47:15.600 --> 47:17.200
"do it yourself"?

47:17.200 --> 47:18.960
I'm familiar with it, of course.

47:20.120 --> 47:22.560
Why do you ask?

47:22.560 --> 47:25.480
I think we should go for a little
walk, Mr Fogg.

47:26.880 --> 47:29.480
I don't want to go for a walk,
I'm rather busy.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.640
Besides, we're in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean.

47:33.640 --> 47:38.480

is why we're going for a walk.
