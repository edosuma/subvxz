00:51.736 --> 00:55.823
I don't understand why we have to drive
seven hours to see a psychiatrist.

00:57.742 --> 01:01.243
Because... we want the
best care possible for you.

01:01.245 --> 01:03.537
<i>When Jules was
eleven years old,</i>

01:03.539 --> 01:05.583
<i>her mother took her on a road trip.</i>

01:28.439 --> 01:31.525
- Wasn't Dali, like, a sexual predator?
- Was he?

01:32.735 --> 01:34.276
I hadn't heard that before.

01:34.278 --> 01:36.362
Would you like me to take it down?

01:36.364 --> 01:38.822
No. It's a cool painting.

01:38.824 --> 01:40.616
It is a cool painting.

01:40.618 --> 01:42.368
<i>He was actually
really sweet, though.</i>

01:42.370 --> 01:44.662
<i>They talked for over an hour,</i>

01:44.664 --> 01:48.042
<i>and only later did Jules realize
that she hadn't lied once.</i>

01:54.966 --> 01:58.761
<i>After the session, they wanted
to give her a tour of the Unit.</i>

02:03.724 --> 02:06.684
- Well, what's the Unit?
- Think of it like a second home,

02:06.686 --> 02:09.603
where children can learn how
to feel better about themselves.

02:09.604 --> 02:11.313
Okay.

02:11.315 --> 02:12.900
Let me give you a tour.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.153
So, this is our common area,

02:18.155 --> 02:20.364
where we have group sessions,

02:20.366 --> 02:22.783
watch movies, play games,

02:22.785 --> 02:24.868
have art class.

02:24.870 --> 02:28.747
Um, on Tuesdays we have
canine therapy.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.544
Uh, Thursdays we have music therapy.

02:37.967 --> 02:41.053
- Dr. Kay!
- Allan!

02:41.971 --> 02:44.181
Suck my dick, you fucking cunt!

02:46.058 --> 02:47.935
Allan!

02:52.064 --> 02:54.565
Usually there's two to a room,

02:54.567 --> 02:57.069
depending on how many patients
are with us.

03:02.908 --> 03:04.908
So the kids live here?

03:04.910 --> 03:07.828
For short periods of time.

03:07.830 --> 03:10.207
And this is the quiet room.

03:11.792 --> 03:15.210
I'm gonna fucking
rape you, Dr. Kay!

03:15.212 --> 03:18.881
You just bought yourself another
30 minutes in the quiet room, Jesse.

03:18.883 --> 03:20.674
<i>It was around
then when Jules thought</i>

03:20.676 --> 03:23.052
<i>she had just about
had enough of the tour.</i>

03:23.054 --> 03:24.430
I think I wanna go home.

03:27.767 --> 03:31.562
<i>And that's when Jules realized,
this wasn't a tour at all.</i>

03:32.772 --> 03:34.730
<i>It was an elaborate plan
to admit her</i>

03:34.732 --> 03:37.775
<i>to a fucking psychiatric hospital.</i>

03:37.777 --> 03:40.569
Mom! Mom!

03:40.571 --> 03:43.113
No, no, no, no, no!

03:43.115 --> 03:48.118
No! No! No!

03:48.120 --> 03:50.037
<i>During the ensuing
struggle, Jules accidentally</i>

03:50.039 --> 03:51.914
<i>scratched an RA across the face,</i>

03:51.916 --> 03:54.460
<i>which she felt really guilty about.</i>

03:56.837 --> 03:59.840
<i>But quickly, that guilt
turned into anger...</i>

04:01.801 --> 04:04.553
<i>and that anger, into defeat.</i>

04:06.597 --> 04:08.973
Hi. I'm Jules.

04:08.975 --> 04:11.850
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.144
Good. Good.

04:14.146 --> 04:17.690
Why don't you tell the group a little
about yourself and why you're here.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.315
I don't know.

04:19.317 --> 04:23.696
Maybe because I was, like,
sad for a really long time.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.364
What do you mean by a long time?

04:25.366 --> 04:28.575
Maybe since I was
seven or eight or something.

04:28.577 --> 04:31.745
And I've been to see,
like, a bunch of doctors.

04:31.747 --> 04:33.580
I've been on, like,
a bunch of medications,

04:33.582 --> 04:35.958
but nothing's really helped, so...

04:35.960 --> 04:38.377
Maybe these mitts will do the trick.

04:38.379 --> 04:41.716
And, Jules, do you self-injure?

04:43.634 --> 04:46.387
<i>The truth was,
Jules hated herself.</i>

04:48.222 --> 04:50.349
<i>She hated
how her brain worked...</i>

04:51.684 --> 04:54.560
<i>the way it would
get stuck on a thought,</i>

04:54.562 --> 04:56.230
<i>like choking.</i>

05:01.527 --> 05:03.944
All right. Keep present.

05:03.946 --> 05:06.488
<i>And it would just play
on an infinite loop,</i>

05:06.490 --> 05:08.616
<i>until she couldn't think</i>

05:08.618 --> 05:10.618
<i>or breathe or stand to be alive.</i>

05:10.620 --> 05:13.579
This is hard, Jules.
You're going to get through it, okay?

05:13.581 --> 05:15.414
<i>She didn't just
hate her brain, though.</i>

05:15.416 --> 05:18.667
<i>She hated her body, not every part,</i>

05:18.669 --> 05:21.295
<i>just her shoulders, and her arms,</i>

05:21.297 --> 05:23.172
<i>and her hands.</i>

05:23.174 --> 05:26.300
<i>Also her chest,
her stomach, her thighs.</i>

05:26.302 --> 05:27.968
<i>Her knees were the worst.</i>

05:27.970 --> 05:31.515
<i>Plus her ankles, and her big,
fucking, stupid feet.</i>

05:34.143 --> 05:37.144
<i>She hated her life,
not because it was bad,</i>

05:37.146 --> 05:40.147
<i>but because when you hate
your brain and your body,</i>

05:40.149 --> 05:42.608
<i>it's hard to enjoy the rest.</i>

05:42.610 --> 05:46.528
<i>So, Jules developed
a few coping mechanisms.</i>

05:46.530 --> 05:49.492
<i>None of them healthy, and a few
scary enough to land her in...</i>

05:54.288 --> 05:57.873
So, how are you liking the Unit?

05:57.875 --> 05:59.293
It's okay.

06:00.252 --> 06:03.047
- Are you making any friends?
- Not really.

06:04.215 --> 06:06.423
Well, that'll change.

06:06.425 --> 06:08.469
Wait. Can you leave
me the rest?

06:11.347 --> 06:12.848
Sure.

06:40.876 --> 06:43.963
- This guy did some damage.
- Allan?

06:45.298 --> 06:47.631
I did something really stupid.

06:47.633 --> 06:50.050
Is everything okay?

06:50.052 --> 06:51.887
I'm so sorry.

06:52.722 --> 06:54.682
Please don't be mad at me.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.486
<i>Eventually Jules got
better and came home.</i>

07:13.534 --> 07:15.911
<i>But her mom got
worse and went away.</i>

07:19.373 --> 07:22.916
<i>And her dad quit his
job to be closer to home,</i>

07:22.918 --> 07:26.170
<i>which she liked,
'cause she loved her dad.</i>

07:26.172 --> 07:29.340
<i>By 13, she started to transition.</i>

07:29.342 --> 07:33.719
<i>And by 16, Jules had gotten
a little slutty.</i>

07:33.721 --> 07:36.013
<i>And every guy was the same:</i>

07:36.015 --> 07:38.807
<i>cis, white, married,</i>

07:38.809 --> 07:41.852
<i>engaged, in long-term relationships,</i>

07:41.854 --> 07:43.604
<i>and always, always...</i>

07:43.606 --> 07:46.943
I mean,
I'm a hundred percent straight.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.863
Um, cool.

07:53.115 --> 07:54.951
So do you like top?

07:56.243 --> 07:59.119
- No.
- Cool.

07:59.121 --> 08:01.540
'Cause that's, like, not my thing.

08:13.886 --> 08:17.014
<i>Some were sweet.
Some were weird.</i>

08:17.848 --> 08:19.642
<i>And a few were aggressive.</i>

08:20.810 --> 08:22.353
Spit.

08:24.897 --> 08:27.608
<i>And whenever anything
got too uncomfortable...</i>

08:29.485 --> 08:32.361
<i>...Jules would just imagine
that she wasn't really herself,</i>

08:32.363 --> 08:35.239
<i>and this wasn't really her life.</i>

08:35.241 --> 08:39.326
<i>She was just a character
in a book or a movie or a show.</i>

08:39.328 --> 08:43.539
<i>That none of it was real, and
if it was, how did it matter?</i>

08:43.541 --> 08:46.168
<i>It's not like her body ever really
belonged to her in the first place.</i>

08:50.923 --> 08:53.551
<i>But fuck it.
She'd save it for the memoirs.</i>

08:56.387 --> 08:59.555
<i>'Cause that was the night
she met her new best friend.</i>

08:59.557 --> 09:02.391
<i>And although she had never
really been in a relationship</i>

09:02.393 --> 09:04.893
<i>or even in, like, love,</i>

09:04.895 --> 09:08.439
<i>she imagined spending
the rest of her life with her.</i>

09:08.441 --> 09:11.567
<i>How they'd live together in
some shitty New York apartment,</i>

09:11.569 --> 09:15.446
<i>and maybe date other people, but
always sleep in the same bed.</i>

09:15.448 --> 09:19.116
<i>She even said it to her once,
which was probably a mistake,</i>

09:19.118 --> 09:21.662
<i>for, like, a lot of reasons.</i>

09:23.789 --> 09:26.206
<i>Plus, that was before
she fell for Tyler,</i>

09:26.208 --> 09:29.920
<i>like, hard, like, really hard.</i>

09:35.092 --> 09:37.468
What are you smiling about?

09:37.470 --> 09:40.181
I don't know.
Just... life.

10:03.371 --> 10:05.623
<i>There's nothing I'm
really passionate about.</i>

10:06.832 --> 10:11.251
You know, like, I'm not dying
to say or do anything, really.

10:11.253 --> 10:13.462
And every time
I admit that to people,

10:13.464 --> 10:16.090
they're like, "Oh, my gosh,
that's so sad." But...

10:16.092 --> 10:18.968
I think that's the case
for most people.

10:18.970 --> 10:23.013
You know? Like, when I look
at my mom or...

10:23.015 --> 10:24.974
like, the kids at my school...

10:24.976 --> 10:28.813
like, their profiles or their
posts and their Tumblr rants...

10:29.730 --> 10:35.109
you realize they're all just
fucked up, too... and lost.

10:35.111 --> 10:38.612
They just have
a reason to mask it...

10:38.614 --> 10:41.323
whether it be, like,
their, their families

10:41.325 --> 10:45.121
or their boyfriends
or their hashtag activism.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.832
And they're just reaching
for something

10:49.834 --> 10:52.084
- to make it all seem meaningful.
- Rue...

10:52.086 --> 10:54.003
But sometimes
I just sit and think...

10:54.005 --> 10:55.879
- Rue. Rue.
- ...like, what's the point?

10:55.881 --> 10:58.299
Rue, I don't give a shit.

10:58.301 --> 11:00.720
- Why'd you call me?
- Honestly...

11:02.430 --> 11:05.141
I didn't really have
anybody else to call.

11:08.561 --> 11:11.022
Well, what happened
to make you call?

11:13.190 --> 11:14.692
Um...

11:20.364 --> 11:21.782
you know...

11:25.995 --> 11:27.536
just like...

11:27.538 --> 11:30.875
Open the fucking door!
Fuck!

11:33.044 --> 11:35.002
...just the usual bullshit.

11:35.004 --> 11:38.758
Rue, you know that drug addicts
don't reach out for help

11:39.634 --> 11:41.552
unless there's no options.

11:42.553 --> 11:44.138
So what happened?

11:49.185 --> 11:50.561
Um...

11:51.646 --> 11:53.604
I was with my best friend.

11:53.606 --> 11:55.940
Okay, well, she's...
I mean, she's a new friend,

11:55.942 --> 11:57.985
but we hang out every day.

11:58.611 --> 12:00.071
And, um...

12:01.906 --> 12:05.074
It's stupid.
It's stupid.

12:05.076 --> 12:06.953
- What?
- I just...

12:09.288 --> 12:13.417
I misread...
the whole situation.

12:15.211 --> 12:18.045
And now it's gonna be
really, really, really...

12:18.047 --> 12:20.381
really fucking awkward.

12:20.383 --> 12:23.467
And I guess that

12:23.469 --> 12:26.595
hanging out with her was...

12:26.597 --> 12:30.559
was the best thing that's
happened to me in a while, so...

12:32.853 --> 12:36.065
Does the way in which you feel
about her remind you of anything?

12:38.025 --> 12:42.611
- What do you mean?
- You know, like... the obsession,

12:42.613 --> 12:45.741
the feelings, the withdrawal.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.328
What, like drugs?

12:50.538 --> 12:52.579
Bingo.

12:52.581 --> 12:55.209
Okay, but this is a good thing.

12:56.127 --> 13:00.339
Didn't drugs feel real good
the first time you tried 'em?

13:11.517 --> 13:12.893
Shit.

13:26.157 --> 13:29.033
Yeah. It's gon' be
a good night, tonight, man.

13:29.035 --> 13:30.494
Let's get this money.

13:41.547 --> 13:43.255
What's good, bro?

13:43.257 --> 13:45.049
Fuck.

13:45.051 --> 13:46.675
- You wanna go on the Gravitron?
- Uh, no.

13:46.677 --> 13:48.218
- The Ferris wheel?
- Nope.

13:48.220 --> 13:50.179
- Why?
- Because I don't wanna die.

13:50.181 --> 13:53.891
Where are you? I'm standing
by the fucking Ferris wheel.

13:53.893 --> 13:56.310
I don't see you.

13:56.312 --> 14:02.441
Why do you always do this to me?

14:02.443 --> 14:05.402
- Whoa! Whoa! Aah!
- We're gonna die, die!

14:05.404 --> 14:08.697
Oh, my God.

14:08.699 --> 14:11.617
Stop! Stop!

14:11.619 --> 14:14.203
Stop! You're rocking
the fucking thing.

14:14.205 --> 14:16.499
- You're rocking...
- Oh, my God.

14:18.751 --> 14:21.585
Yo, are you at this Ferris
wheel or that Ferris wheel?

14:21.587 --> 14:23.754
Well, how the fuck am I supposed
to know which one you're at?

14:23.756 --> 14:25.464
You don't fucking tell me...

14:25.466 --> 14:27.174
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm on my way. I...

14:27.176 --> 14:29.679
How am I supposed to know that
there's two Ferris wheels?

14:32.640 --> 14:35.182
- Yo, why are dressed like a hooker?
- What?

14:35.184 --> 14:37.685
Jesus Christ, Maddy.
I'm here with my parents.

14:37.687 --> 14:40.062
- So what? It's the carnival.
- No. It's the chili cook-off.

14:40.064 --> 14:41.605
It's very important. I can't have you

14:41.607 --> 14:43.148
hanging out at the booth
dressed like that.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.775
Yeah, well maybe it'll sell better.

14:44.777 --> 14:47.194
Yo, this isn't a fucking joke, okay?

14:47.196 --> 14:48.821
Why are you being like this?

14:48.823 --> 14:51.615
Listen, my parents
already don't like you.

14:51.617 --> 14:52.994
What?

14:53.869 --> 14:56.245
Go home, get changed,

14:56.247 --> 14:59.125
and come back looking like a person.
Fuck.

15:06.424 --> 15:08.382
- Well, did you break up again?
- No.

15:08.384 --> 15:10.342
- Looks like you broke up again.
- No, we didn't.

15:10.344 --> 15:13.014
If you ask me, she's a distraction.

15:15.558 --> 15:17.683
Hurry up, guy, go!

15:17.685 --> 15:20.438
- Oh!
- Ew!

15:25.818 --> 15:27.320
Hold on.

15:28.487 --> 15:30.448
Oh, my God.
Jules!

15:31.616 --> 15:32.992
Come!

15:36.037 --> 15:38.623
Hands and feet inside the ride
unless you want to die.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.920
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:46.922 --> 15:49.050
I'm really fucking scared.

15:51.719 --> 15:53.220
Oh, no!

16:32.385 --> 16:34.218
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.389
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

16:38.849 --> 16:42.559
Um, I think she's in love with her.

16:42.561 --> 16:44.436
Really?

16:44.438 --> 16:48.023
Yeah, like... Rue is in
love with Jules, I think.

16:48.025 --> 16:51.195
- Are you mad at me?
- No. No, no.

16:52.863 --> 16:54.947
Are you mad at me?

16:54.949 --> 16:57.032
- No.
- Okay.

16:57.034 --> 16:59.201
Don't you think?

16:59.203 --> 17:01.370
I hadn't really thought about it.

17:01.372 --> 17:04.330
Oh. I don't know.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.126
Can we just pretend like
what I did wasn't super-weird?

17:07.127 --> 17:10.337
- It wasn't weird. It...
- It was weird, but...

17:10.339 --> 17:12.383
we don't have to talk about it.

17:13.968 --> 17:15.925
Talk about what?

17:15.928 --> 17:18.637
- Nothing.
- Right.

17:18.638 --> 17:22.558
Okay, um... Anyway, I'm gonna
go catch some friends.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.060
- All right.
- Okay.

17:35.156 --> 17:37.156
- Uh-oh. Mr. Jacobs.
- Oh!

17:37.158 --> 17:38.949
- Stingray McKay.
- I see you...

17:38.951 --> 17:40.743
- I see what you got going on over here.
- All right, chili.

17:40.745 --> 17:42.286
Let me get some.

17:42.288 --> 17:44.496
- Yo, what's up, brother?
- How you doin', man?

17:44.498 --> 17:46.000
Yo.

17:47.376 --> 17:50.336
What are you... Are you guys,
like, in a relationship?

17:50.338 --> 17:52.921
- Nah, we're just chillin'.
- Are you just chillin'?

17:52.923 --> 17:55.507
Yeah, we're chillin'.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.843
Okay. Okay.

17:57.845 --> 18:00.220
Why haven't I seen you on the field?

18:00.222 --> 18:04.391
Uh.... Just freshmen got to earn
their due, that's all.

18:04.393 --> 18:07.647
You take that attitude, you'll spend
the rest of your life on the bench.

18:09.315 --> 18:12.358
It's really not that big of a deal, Mr.
Jacobs. It's just the first season.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.984
No, it is a big deal.

18:13.986 --> 18:16.487
You got one of the best
slide-steps I've ever seen.

18:16.489 --> 18:18.238
You've got promise.
You've got talent.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.990
You're not pushing yourself
hard enough.

18:19.992 --> 18:22.326
Dad, I think McKay's
gonna be just fine.

18:22.328 --> 18:25.414
I'm just trying to help him
keep a girl like her.

18:27.416 --> 18:30.084
Why? It's not like
we're in a relationship.

18:30.086 --> 18:32.797
- Plus, I don't even care about football.
- Whoa.

18:34.131 --> 18:37.675
It's not just football.
It's life.

18:37.677 --> 18:40.469
It's about maintaining your focus.

18:40.471 --> 18:43.973
It's about putting your all
into everything you do.

18:43.975 --> 18:46.600
Why do you think I have
the business I have?

18:46.602 --> 18:48.769
Why do think I have
the family I have?

18:48.771 --> 18:50.896
The success that I have?

18:50.898 --> 18:53.107
Why do think this chili

18:53.109 --> 18:56.568
has been voted best chili in the
county five years in a row?

18:56.570 --> 18:58.197
'Cause you refuse to lose.

19:02.076 --> 19:04.662
It's about who you want
to become in the world.

19:05.538 --> 19:07.540
I'm just lookin' out for you.

19:10.209 --> 19:12.293
- Bye.
- Cassie.

19:12.295 --> 19:15.214
- What the fuck is her problem?
- Come on, bro.

19:20.970 --> 19:23.222
Yo, Cass. Cass.

19:24.056 --> 19:25.597
Cass, stop.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.683
Why would you say that?

19:27.685 --> 19:29.602
That we're just chillin'?

19:29.604 --> 19:31.645
It's not that big of a deal,
Cass. It's a figure of speech.

19:31.647 --> 19:33.564
- It is a big deal.
- It's really not.

19:33.566 --> 19:35.566
You literally just told me
that you loved me.

19:35.568 --> 19:37.359
What does that have
to do with anything?

19:37.361 --> 19:40.404
You just told Nate that we're not
even in a fucking relationship.

19:40.406 --> 19:43.115
That's because I know the guy.
He's just gonna talk shit.

19:43.117 --> 19:46.035
- Like what?
- Like about you.

19:46.037 --> 19:47.870
Or whatever, Cassie.

19:47.872 --> 19:49.957
What do you mean, whatever?

19:50.750 --> 19:52.710
Like whatever the fuck you've done.

19:54.587 --> 19:56.505
What have I done, McKay?

19:57.757 --> 20:00.049
Look, I don't want to talk
about this right now, Cass.

20:00.051 --> 20:01.634
We're in the middle
of a fucking carnival.

20:01.636 --> 20:03.471
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:08.643 --> 20:11.771
It's not like it's that big
of a fucking secret, Cassie.

20:16.108 --> 20:18.025
You know what?
It's cool.

20:18.027 --> 20:21.614
We should just call it a night.
I gotta get back, anyway.

20:35.419 --> 20:38.629
- So, what you was lookin' for?
- Molly.

20:38.631 --> 20:41.300
Oh. She over there workin'
at the pretzel stand.

20:42.051 --> 20:43.469
Thank you.

20:51.811 --> 20:53.312
Hey.

20:54.021 --> 20:56.188
- Hey.
- You're not having fun?

20:56.190 --> 20:58.234
- No.
- Yeah, me, neither.

20:59.277 --> 21:01.028
You wanna do Molly?

21:02.405 --> 21:05.948
Welcome to Pretzelmania.
Can I take your order?

21:05.950 --> 21:08.075
How many pretzels do you want?

21:08.077 --> 21:10.869
- We don't eat carbs.
- Two, please.

21:10.871 --> 21:12.748
That'll be forty.

21:17.628 --> 21:19.755
So, you think Nate's
cheating on you?

21:20.798 --> 21:23.759
I don't know. He's just been
acting super-weird lately.

21:28.514 --> 21:30.599
Have you gone through his phone?

21:32.101 --> 21:34.727
I've never not gone through
someone's phone.

21:34.729 --> 21:36.897
Bitch, you're my soul mate.

21:39.734 --> 21:41.527
Thank you.

21:43.696 --> 21:45.654
Yo, what's going
on with you and McKay?

21:45.656 --> 21:47.239
I thought you two were in love.

21:47.241 --> 21:49.617
Nate asked McKay
if were were in a relationship,

21:49.619 --> 21:51.744
and McKay said that
we were just chillin'.

21:51.746 --> 21:53.537
- What?
- Yeah.

21:53.539 --> 21:56.665
Honestly, fuck them both.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.334
Right?

21:58.336 --> 22:00.461
Okay, so if I
tell you something,

22:00.463 --> 22:02.921
you swear on your fucking life
you won't say a word?

22:02.923 --> 22:04.467
Yeah. What?

22:05.968 --> 22:07.762
I went through Nate's phone.

22:08.804 --> 22:10.598
And it was weird.

22:21.859 --> 22:23.525
- Oh, my fucking God.
- What?

22:23.527 --> 22:25.069
- That's him.
- Who?

22:25.071 --> 22:26.779
The guy.

22:26.781 --> 22:29.823
- What guy?
- The one from the motel.

22:29.825 --> 22:31.408
Okay, what guy are
we looking at, exactly?

22:31.410 --> 22:34.119
Okay, the one in the apron,
serving the chili.

22:34.121 --> 22:35.704
- I swear to God.
- No fucking way.

22:35.706 --> 22:37.247
Jules, do you know who that is?

22:37.249 --> 22:39.750
- Yeah, the guy from the motel.
- That's Cal Jacobs.

22:39.752 --> 22:41.752
- Who's that?
- Nate Jacobs's dad.

22:41.754 --> 22:44.755
- That's Nate's dad?
- Yes, that's Nate's dad.

22:44.757 --> 22:46.924
- No fucking way!
- Yes, fucking way.

22:46.926 --> 22:48.884
- You're full of shit.
- No way.

22:48.886 --> 22:50.262
You're full of shit.

22:51.055 --> 22:52.888
Do you... Do you know who he is?

22:52.890 --> 22:55.099
He fucking owns half this town.
He built it.

22:55.101 --> 22:57.059
All the apartment buildings
past Kemper, they're his.

22:57.061 --> 22:58.686
- Rue, I swear to God.
- There's no way.

22:58.688 --> 23:00.312
- That's the guy I fucked.
- There's no way.

23:00.314 --> 23:01.897
Bullshit.

23:01.899 --> 23:04.149
I'm being a hundred percent serious.

23:04.151 --> 23:07.361
- You... You don't believe me?
- No, actually.

23:07.363 --> 23:09.657
- I don't.
- Okay. Watch.

23:19.166 --> 23:22.420
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hmm?

23:24.839 --> 23:27.381
Hi. Can I help you?

23:27.383 --> 23:29.802
Uh, can I please have
a small cup of chili?

23:31.053 --> 23:32.430
Yeah, sure.

23:50.781 --> 23:52.325
Oh.

23:53.034 --> 23:54.575
Shoot.

23:54.577 --> 23:56.203
Sorry.

24:00.916 --> 24:04.043
Uh, it... it's okay.
It was my fault.

24:04.045 --> 24:05.671
I'll get you another cup.

24:07.340 --> 24:10.549
Hi. It's two dollars. All the
proceeds go to the football team.

24:10.551 --> 24:13.010
Uh... cool.

24:13.012 --> 24:14.388
Thank you.

24:24.148 --> 24:25.524
Thanks.

24:29.987 --> 24:32.446
Yo, Nate, who was that?

24:32.448 --> 24:35.449
Her name's Jules.
She's new here.

24:35.451 --> 24:37.036
She goes to East Highland?

24:38.454 --> 24:40.537
Yeah. She's a junior.

24:40.539 --> 24:42.206
Damn. That's jailbait.

24:42.208 --> 24:44.377
That's too bad.

24:47.922 --> 24:50.255
- ...nuts!
- Why the fuck did you let me do that?

24:50.257 --> 24:52.216
I didn't let you do that!
You just fucking...

24:52.218 --> 24:55.427
You just did it. You went over
there and you did it.

24:55.429 --> 24:57.346
Did you see that
his hands were fucking shaking?

24:57.348 --> 24:59.556
- Yes, and then he dropped...
- And then he fucking dropped the chili!

24:59.558 --> 25:01.392
- Oh, my God.
- He dropped the fucking chili.

25:01.394 --> 25:03.852
Oh, he dropped the fucking chili.
And then he...

25:03.854 --> 25:05.396
And then you looked at me.

25:05.398 --> 25:07.648
Yeah, because
I was screaming inside.

25:07.650 --> 25:10.234
Yeah, well, that made him
fucking look at me.

25:10.236 --> 25:12.069
- He looked at me in the fucking eyes.
- I'm sorry.

25:12.071 --> 25:14.280
I feel so bad. That was
literally the meanest thing

25:14.282 --> 25:16.198
- I've ever done.
- Oh, shit, hold on. It's my mom.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.868
Hey, Mom.

25:19.537 --> 25:21.453
Yeah. Yeah, no.

25:21.455 --> 25:24.959
Well, because she's been in the
Gravitron for like 20 straight minutes.

25:26.294 --> 25:29.338
Yes, yes. I promise.
We will be home by ten.

25:30.214 --> 25:32.091
Okay, I love you, too.

25:33.259 --> 25:35.553
Apparently, Gia's
not answering her phone.

25:36.762 --> 25:38.889
- Uh...
- It's just going straight to voicemail.

25:45.354 --> 25:46.939
It burns.

25:49.442 --> 25:52.109
It's so weird
to think that, like,

25:52.111 --> 25:54.528
no matter what happens,

25:54.530 --> 25:58.826
the universe is just out here
giving, like, zero fucks.

26:00.202 --> 26:01.579
Wow.

26:04.165 --> 26:07.333
- You look super cute.
- Thanks. You, too. I love that shirt.

26:07.335 --> 26:10.210
Thank you. Even though I
have the same body as Bruno Mars.

26:10.212 --> 26:12.046
- Shut up, you look hot.
- No, I don't.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.631
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't,

26:13.633 --> 26:15.549
'cause
these right here, they're cutlets.

26:15.551 --> 26:18.510
No, they're not. Trust me,
these guys are super chill, okay?

26:18.512 --> 26:20.137
Do not worry.

26:20.139 --> 26:22.181
- Your mom's, like, all organic, right?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

26:22.183 --> 26:25.476
- There's your issue.
- What do you mean?

26:25.478 --> 26:28.354
Uh, organic food doesn't
have any good hormones.

26:28.356 --> 26:31.357
You gotta get her to buy, like,
the regular stuff, okay?

26:31.359 --> 26:33.067
What's the regular stuff?

26:33.069 --> 26:35.861
- Trust me. Oh, and milk, and milk.
- No! I hate milk!

26:35.863 --> 26:38.155
At least three glasses a day.
Three glasses.

26:38.157 --> 26:40.532
That's how I went
from a small A to a full B.

26:40.534 --> 26:42.076
Mm-hmm.

26:42.078 --> 26:44.078
- Fine, I'll try it.
- I'm telling you.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.413
- You gotta do it.
- How old are the boys again?

26:46.415 --> 26:47.792
They're, like, our age.
Yeah.

26:48.584 --> 26:50.292
That's a lot.

26:50.294 --> 26:52.294
- I know.
- They are so good.

26:52.296 --> 26:53.837
- Right?
- I could drink these, like,

26:53.839 --> 26:55.464
- every day of my life.
- Yes.

26:55.466 --> 26:58.550
Uh, how 'bout you grab
another slushie,

26:58.552 --> 27:02.805
I go get more tickets, and then get
super drunk and ride the Ferris wheel?

27:02.807 --> 27:04.473
Deal.

27:04.475 --> 27:06.141
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

27:06.143 --> 27:07.520
All right.

27:10.231 --> 27:12.191
- Thank you.
- No problem.

27:31.794 --> 27:33.419
Just tell your sister
I really need her

27:33.421 --> 27:35.713
- to cover my shift on Wednesday.
- Okay.

27:35.715 --> 27:38.299
For real. She's not
answering any of my texts.

27:38.301 --> 27:40.467
I promise you I will say something.

27:40.469 --> 27:43.095
I'm supposed to meet my
boyfriend's family for the first time.

27:43.097 --> 27:44.680
It's really important.

27:44.682 --> 27:46.432
Yeah, I got you.

27:46.434 --> 27:48.436
Thank you.
You're the best.

28:00.364 --> 28:03.574
- Honestly, fuck that whole family.
- For real.

28:03.576 --> 28:06.285
'Cause right now I'm looking at
a thousand versions of myself,

28:06.287 --> 28:09.663
and not only do I look good,
I fucking feel good.

28:09.665 --> 28:11.665
- It's a bitch.
- So, if they've got something to say,

28:11.667 --> 28:13.709
they should just say it
to my face, right?

28:13.711 --> 28:15.753
Or you could just say it
to their fucking face.

28:15.755 --> 28:18.922
- Right?
- That's what I would do.

28:18.924 --> 28:22.593
- I feel like this is a turning point.
- Totally.

28:22.595 --> 28:25.971
We should just pick the hottest,

28:25.973 --> 28:30.059
most confident,
bad bitch version of ourselves,

28:30.061 --> 28:33.145
and be that for the rest
of the school year.

28:33.147 --> 28:35.648
Yo.

28:35.650 --> 28:38.442
And this year's winner
of the chili cook-off is...

28:38.444 --> 28:40.446
Cal Jacobs!

28:41.781 --> 28:44.408
Make it six years and running!

29:01.926 --> 29:03.467
Yeah, I'm not supposed
to be here right now,

29:03.469 --> 29:05.135
because I'm dressed like a hooker,

29:05.137 --> 29:06.971
and none of you like me,

29:06.973 --> 29:08.764
but I just wanted to say
congratulations.

29:08.766 --> 29:10.349
Maddy, get out of...

29:10.351 --> 29:12.726
Ooh!

29:12.728 --> 29:14.520
What in God's name is your problem?

29:14.522 --> 29:16.565
You, cunt.

29:25.283 --> 29:27.994
- Hey.
- 'Sup, Cass?

29:29.745 --> 29:32.204
You wanna ride the carousel?

29:32.206 --> 29:34.123
Cool.

29:34.125 --> 29:37.001
Shit.
She's not answering.

29:37.003 --> 29:40.129
- It's just going straight to voicemail.
- I mean, she can't be too far.

29:40.131 --> 29:42.506
Well, I have to get her home
in like, 30 minutes.

29:42.508 --> 29:45.301
- Gia!
- Gia!

29:45.303 --> 29:46.929
Excuse me. Sorry.

29:48.431 --> 29:49.807
Gia!

29:52.560 --> 29:54.312
- Gia!
- Gia!

29:57.690 --> 30:00.149
Fuck. Okay. Uh...

30:00.151 --> 30:01.900
It'd be faster if we split up.

30:01.902 --> 30:04.488
- Yeah. Okay. Text me. Thank you.
- Okay.

30:05.990 --> 30:07.698
I'm not
gonna let you fucking embarrass me

30:07.700 --> 30:09.660
like that again,
I swear to fucking God.

30:10.786 --> 30:12.870
Shut the fuck up!
I'm fucking done with you!

30:12.872 --> 30:14.496
- I'm so fucking done with you.
- So what else is new?

30:14.498 --> 30:16.081
- I'm not fucking joking.
- Yeah, fucking right.

30:16.083 --> 30:18.334
Calling my mom a cunt.
What the fuck is actually wrong

30:18.336 --> 30:20.379
- with your fucking brain?
- I think you're overreacting.

30:24.091 --> 30:26.675
You're fucking dead to me.

30:26.677 --> 30:28.137
Fuck you.

30:30.389 --> 30:32.975
- I do have one question, though.
- Yo, what?

30:36.854 --> 30:40.856
Man, I'm telling you, that
girl has some real, fucking issues.

30:40.858 --> 30:42.902
I have to use the bathroom.

30:44.278 --> 30:46.072
Gia!

30:48.491 --> 30:49.909
Gia!

30:51.410 --> 30:52.787
Gia!

31:27.029 --> 31:28.698
Got an extra cigarette?

32:01.272 --> 32:03.399
Damn, you're so fucking hot.

32:05.610 --> 32:08.070
I could ride the carousel for hours!

32:11.574 --> 32:13.991
- Emma. Yo.
- Yo, Rue. What up?

32:13.993 --> 32:17.536
- Have you seen Gia?
- Yeah, like, over there.

32:17.538 --> 32:20.623
- Over where? Where is she?
- You know. Like, the Gravitron.

32:20.625 --> 32:23.542
- Is she in the Gravitron?
- No, she's like, by it.

32:23.544 --> 32:25.880
I... I really have to pee.

32:35.514 --> 32:37.058
Gia!

32:46.567 --> 32:48.108
Gia!

32:48.110 --> 32:49.652
Gia!

32:49.654 --> 32:52.154
Aren't you Luke Kasten?

32:52.156 --> 32:53.697
Yeah.

32:53.699 --> 32:55.991
You used to go
to East Highland, right?

32:55.993 --> 32:58.829
Yeah, like, fuckin' forever ago.

33:00.331 --> 33:03.624
I used to hear stories about you,
like, all the time in middle school.

33:03.626 --> 33:05.628
Oh, yeah?
What kind of stories?

33:08.506 --> 33:10.255
That you had a...

33:10.257 --> 33:12.927
have a really big dick and
fucked every girl in your grade.

33:15.346 --> 33:17.056
Basically.

33:17.848 --> 33:19.558
That's cool.

33:21.894 --> 33:23.688
How old are you?

33:26.941 --> 33:28.359
Sixteen.

33:59.056 --> 34:02.057
I'm just saying, as your girlfriend,
those pictures are a little suspicious.

34:02.059 --> 34:03.601
It's not what it looks like.

34:03.603 --> 34:05.311
Yeah? Well, then, explain
to me why you have

34:05.313 --> 34:07.896
someone else's dick in your phone.

34:07.898 --> 34:09.857
It's really fucking complicated.

34:09.859 --> 34:12.484
How many reasons could there be?

34:12.485 --> 34:14.527
I can't explain it to you right now.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.655
Yeah, what does that mean?

34:16.657 --> 34:19.534
Look, I'm going through
a lot of shit right now.

34:21.661 --> 34:23.954
I need... I just...
I need you to promise me

34:23.956 --> 34:25.664
that you're not gonna tell a soul.

34:25.666 --> 34:27.666
I am not gonna
tell anyone, I promise.

34:27.668 --> 34:30.335
- Like, on your life.
- Yeah, on my life.

34:30.338 --> 34:33.382
I'm sorry I got so angry
at you before.

34:34.884 --> 34:36.594
I am sorry.

34:41.139 --> 34:42.641
I'm sorry.

34:46.771 --> 34:48.356
I love you.

34:49.565 --> 34:50.983
Maddy, I love you.

34:53.485 --> 34:55.235
I got a lot of sh...

34:55.237 --> 34:57.823
a lot of shit going on right
now and I'm really confused.

34:58.574 --> 35:00.451
I don't know what to do.

36:21.991 --> 36:24.869
Ho, ho, ho. Nasty!

36:52.355 --> 36:53.856
Gia!

36:56.067 --> 36:58.567
What the hell?
I've been calling you.

36:58.569 --> 37:00.196
Rue.

37:02.615 --> 37:05.534
- Are you stoned right now?
- Nah. Um-mm.

37:08.996 --> 37:10.996
- We're just chillin'.
- Yeah, that's my sister.

37:10.998 --> 37:12.581
- Yo, Roy.
- What's up?

37:12.583 --> 37:14.416
This is Rue's little sis.

37:14.418 --> 37:17.920
Oh, yeah. I knew that by the
way she was hittin' the weed.

37:17.922 --> 37:19.546
That's me.

37:19.548 --> 37:21.298
All right, Gia, get up.
Let's go.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.969
What do you mean, let's go?
You see we're having a funky good time.

37:24.971 --> 37:27.554
- That's great.
- I'm having the best time.

37:27.556 --> 37:30.015
- We need to go, now.
- We having the best time.

37:30.017 --> 37:31.684
Gia, get the fuck up and let's go.

37:31.686 --> 37:33.227
- I'm not playing with you.
- Wow.

37:33.229 --> 37:35.437
What'd you do?
Decide to just clean up,

37:35.439 --> 37:37.731
- and, like, oh, I wanna become a mom?
- Right?

37:37.733 --> 37:41.568
- Gia, get the fuck up. Let's go. Now.
- Mom. What's your problem, Mom?

37:41.570 --> 37:44.907
Hey, if she's a mom,
you know she a MILF.

37:46.951 --> 37:48.492
Get up.

37:48.494 --> 37:50.997
Yo, for real. When'd you
become such a bitch?

37:55.334 --> 37:57.126
Excuse me?

37:57.128 --> 37:59.463
Was it after you fuckin' OD'd?

38:01.966 --> 38:05.592
Yeah. It's good.
I know it's only weed,

38:05.594 --> 38:07.763
but you might get addicted.

38:10.016 --> 38:11.557
Get up.

38:11.559 --> 38:14.145
Just hope you don't
get addicted again.

38:15.896 --> 38:17.813
All I'm saying is, if I were you,

38:17.815 --> 38:20.151
I wouldn't be taking
advice from her.

38:21.819 --> 38:24.155
Yo. Text me.

38:25.197 --> 38:27.489
Don't do that
shit again, all right?

38:27.491 --> 38:29.535
You fucking scared me.

38:41.756 --> 38:43.215
Hey.

38:47.136 --> 38:50.596
Look, I know you have the power
to ruin my life right now.

38:50.598 --> 38:53.057
I'm begging you,

38:53.059 --> 38:55.559
pleading with you,

38:55.561 --> 38:57.063
please don't.

38:58.773 --> 39:01.607
I know you already told your friend.
I saw her look at me.

39:01.609 --> 39:04.193
She won't tell anyone.

39:04.195 --> 39:07.029
- I promise.
- 'Cause if this ever came out,

39:07.031 --> 39:09.992
I'd lose everything.
I'd lose everything.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.997
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

39:20.336 --> 39:25.216
I have no intention of, like,
hurting you or anything.

39:28.719 --> 39:30.680
I'm sorry about earlier.

39:31.931 --> 39:33.766
That was kind of dumb.

39:36.352 --> 39:37.812
That's okay.

39:39.981 --> 39:41.399
I just wanted to...

39:42.316 --> 39:43.901
It won't be a thing.

39:44.860 --> 39:47.405
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

39:49.115 --> 39:50.700
Thank you so much.

40:26.235 --> 40:28.235
Where were you?

40:28.237 --> 40:30.988
- What's wrong?
- I just think the Molly's, like,

40:30.990 --> 40:33.743
way too strong or something.

40:42.752 --> 40:46.045
So... did you come?

40:46.047 --> 40:47.465
No.

40:57.850 --> 41:00.267
Uh, do you think Mom's gonna be

41:00.269 --> 41:02.436
sitting in the living room
when we get there?

41:02.438 --> 41:04.607
- No, she won't.
- Okay.

41:06.108 --> 41:08.110
Because, if, um...

41:09.070 --> 41:11.946
If I walked in there,
I wouldn't know what to say.

41:11.948 --> 41:15.407
- I wouldn't say hi.
- No, she's... She's gonna be in her bed.

41:15.409 --> 41:18.202
Trust me. Look, I need you,
when we get home,

41:18.204 --> 41:20.913
to just go straight to your room
and hide under the covers. Okay?

41:20.915 --> 41:23.165
Just let me deal with her.

41:23.167 --> 41:25.834
Wh-what are you gonna tell her?

41:25.836 --> 41:28.005
I don't know yet.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.635
What are you laughing at?

41:34.261 --> 41:35.846
You good?

41:37.723 --> 41:39.558
Come here.

41:46.899 --> 41:50.818
She's still a little sick from
riding the Gravitron so many times.

41:50.820 --> 41:53.864
- Should I check on her?
- Oh, no. It's good. I got it.

41:55.700 --> 41:58.536
Thank you for looking out
for her tonight.

42:00.162 --> 42:02.204
- Of course.
- Love you.

42:02.206 --> 42:05.710
- Love you, too. Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

43:22.119 --> 43:23.955
Hey. Shut the door.

45:04.722 --> 45:06.098
Hey.

45:08.184 --> 45:09.560
Tyler?

45:27.787 --> 45:29.370
No. No!

45:29.372 --> 45:31.497
No, I'm not trying
to hurt you. I'm not.

45:31.499 --> 45:33.707
I'm not here to hurt you.

45:33.709 --> 45:36.460
I know that you have
these ideas about me,

45:36.462 --> 45:38.673
based on the first time that
we met, and I understand that.

45:40.091 --> 45:42.176
But I'm not the person
that you met that night.

45:43.135 --> 45:44.512
Can you let go of me?

46:02.113 --> 46:04.282
You know, over the past few weeks...

46:06.117 --> 46:07.660
I've spent...

46:08.911 --> 46:11.747
every moment of every day
getting to know you.

46:14.292 --> 46:15.876
At night...

46:16.669 --> 46:18.296
I fall asleep to you.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.882
And in the morning...

46:22.717 --> 46:24.093
I wake up to you.

46:27.054 --> 46:31.475
I kind of feel closer to you than I
do to anyone in the whole world.

46:36.022 --> 46:37.982
I don't trust you, Nate.

46:42.737 --> 46:44.655
I don't trust you, either.

47:13.434 --> 47:16.226
- Open your mouth.
- Nate...

47:16.228 --> 47:17.647
Wider.

47:21.150 --> 47:23.319
Nate. Nate, stop.

47:25.613 --> 47:28.115
God, are you broken inside.

47:29.575 --> 47:31.994
And that's precisely why
I don't trust you.

47:35.957 --> 47:39.126
Because you're so broken
you don't even trust yourself.

47:41.337 --> 47:43.381
And that's scary.

47:44.465 --> 47:48.175
Not just for you, but for me.

47:48.177 --> 47:50.596
And for my entire family.

47:53.307 --> 47:56.517
I wouldn't answer that.
You're gonna wanna hear this.

47:56.519 --> 47:59.895
Over the last three weeks,

47:59.897 --> 48:04.149
you have knowingly produced and
distributed child pornography.

48:04.151 --> 48:07.569
Including obscene images that
were taken on school property.

48:07.571 --> 48:10.489
I've compiled all these photos,

48:10.491 --> 48:14.662
along with an IP address, and an
account that's linked to your name.

48:16.914 --> 48:20.459
I don't know if you're familiar with
child pornography laws in this state.

48:22.169 --> 48:25.589
But they apply to minors
just as they apply to adults.

48:26.924 --> 48:29.008
I sent them to you.

48:29.010 --> 48:31.302
No. You sent them

48:31.304 --> 48:34.223
to an account of a person
that doesn't fucking exist.

48:35.391 --> 48:39.228
And I mean, anyone can anonymously
report child pornography, right?

48:41.772 --> 48:44.523
- Then I'd tell them everything.
- Okay.

48:44.525 --> 48:47.901
You could do that, but, um...

48:47.903 --> 48:50.406
here's what would definitely happen.

48:52.658 --> 48:55.161
You'd end up on
a sex offenders list.

48:56.871 --> 48:58.873
It means no more college.

49:00.207 --> 49:03.628
It's gonna be very fucking
difficult to find a job.

49:06.922 --> 49:09.131
And everywhere you go,

49:09.133 --> 49:11.800
for the rest of your life,

49:11.802 --> 49:14.303
you'll be harassed, and spat at,

49:14.305 --> 49:16.265
and treated like a fucking animal.

49:17.975 --> 49:21.812
You deserve better than that.
'Cause I know you.

49:23.856 --> 49:26.233
You're kind.

49:27.193 --> 49:30.110
You're smart.
You're generous.

49:30.112 --> 49:32.237
You got a big heart.

49:32.239 --> 49:36.577
You deserve whatever the fuck it
is in this world that you want.

49:38.663 --> 49:40.412
So keep your head down.

49:40.414 --> 49:42.375
Keep your mouth shut.

49:44.335 --> 49:47.169
Don't try to ruin my life,

49:47.171 --> 49:49.590
and I won't have to ruin yours.

49:52.718 --> 49:54.845
You know what I think?

49:56.681 --> 50:00.101
I think you're a fucking faggot,
just like your daddy.

50:12.530 --> 50:14.282
You have a nice night.

51:02.830 --> 51:05.080
- Hey.
- Hey.

51:05.082 --> 51:07.710
Do you think
I could, uh, sleep over?

51:08.586 --> 51:10.963
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Come on.

51:49.627 --> 51:51.253
Is everything okay?

51:58.386 --> 52:00.260
Um...

52:00.262 --> 52:02.014
Here.

52:04.058 --> 52:06.850
So how'd the date go with Tyler?

52:06.852 --> 52:08.562
Um...

52:18.114 --> 52:20.658
He didn't look like his picture.

52:39.093 --> 52:40.928
Come here.

53:03.284 --> 53:05.202
Are you sure you're okay?

54:11.102 --> 54:12.520
What?

54:15.856 --> 54:20.856
