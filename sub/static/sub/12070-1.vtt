Oh, my God.

What is it?

03:29.944 --> 03:32.878
It's like angel-hair pasta in here, brother.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.384
Um...

03:39.386 --> 03:40.852
here. Try it now.

03:51.464 --> 03:54.466
[engine grinding]

03:54.468 --> 03:55.567
Anything?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.035
Nothing.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.282
Okay.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.717
Oh, this is terrible.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.785
All right.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.356
So...

04:17.358 --> 04:19.925
Um...

04:19.927 --> 04:22.127
[both laughing]

04:23.329 --> 04:25.664
Why do we even bother to pop the hood?

04:25.666 --> 04:27.132
I thought I heard something.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.001
Yeah, well, unless there's a flashing neon sign

04:29.003 --> 04:30.402
that says, "Here's your problem,"

04:30.404 --> 04:31.803
what the hell do we know?

04:31.805 --> 04:33.272
[sizzles] Fuck, that's hot.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.473
Careful.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.177
What you got?

04:39.179 --> 04:41.713
I got no service. What about you?

04:41.715 --> 04:44.483
I hardly get service in the city,

04:44.485 --> 04:45.917
let alone the desert.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.887
Yeah, I got nothing, man.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.623
Where the hell are we, anyway?

04:51.625 --> 04:52.658
Uh...

04:52.660 --> 04:54.426
let me see.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.363
Okay.

05:01.634 --> 05:05.637
We, um... We passed this dot...

05:05.639 --> 05:07.339
about an hour ago.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.907
I think we're in here someplace.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.409
That's like 60 miles back.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.844
Wow. It's like a hundred miles to the next dot.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.547
What the hell are you doing driving
us through the middle of nowhere?

05:15.549 --> 05:17.616
We're taking the scenic route, remember?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.418
Yeah, by scenic, I was thinking...

05:19.420 --> 05:22.120
I don't know, more trees, mountains, people,

05:22.122 --> 05:23.922
dots a lot closer together.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.892
By scenic, I meant rarely seen.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.360
[inhales deeply]

05:28.362 --> 05:30.562
I'm gonna get you a dictionary when we get back.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.730
Okay.

05:31.732 --> 05:35.300
Holy shit, it's hot out here, man.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.602
It's gotta be, like, 115 degrees.

05:39.572 --> 05:40.572
I know.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.573
Not even noon!

05:41.575 --> 05:42.808
No wonder the truck died.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.543
Something probably melted.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.180
Have we even seen any cars?

05:48.182 --> 05:49.114
Ow. No,

05:49.116 --> 05:50.882
but, uh, it's a road, right?

05:50.884 --> 05:52.884
I mean, someone'll be along soon.

05:53.753 --> 05:55.654
Well, we got about 20 jelly beans

05:55.656 --> 05:57.022
and 6 ounces of melted ice.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.623
That should last us 10 minutes.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.624
Oh, good.

06:00.893 --> 06:01.960
It's pretty.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.362
Yeah. It's beautiful.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.363
Ohh!

06:04.365 --> 06:05.797
[laughs]

06:05.799 --> 06:07.332
Ohh!

06:07.334 --> 06:08.333
[gags]

06:08.335 --> 06:09.368
[spits]

06:09.370 --> 06:10.769
What flavor is this?

06:10.771 --> 06:11.770
Bacon and margarita.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.838
Oh, my God!

06:12.840 --> 06:14.873
I saved those two just for you.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.208
[laughs]

06:16.210 --> 06:19.478
Tastes like that cake you made with the onions.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.879
Remember that shit?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.648
Yeah, I remember.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.450
I think that brings your total

06:25.452 --> 06:28.186
of veiled references to things I did with Karen

06:28.188 --> 06:31.189
up to three, so feel free to stop, please.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.925
You never think about her, man? Ever?

06:33.927 --> 06:36.428
I probably think about her

06:36.430 --> 06:38.497
about as much as she thinks about me.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.932
[winces] Well, she thinks about you a lot, dude.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.001
I ran into her last week, and, uh,

06:43.003 --> 06:44.803
you were all she can talk about.

06:44.805 --> 06:48.106
She said she was floored to
hear you had a wife and kid.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.775
Yeah, well, it floors me sometimes, too.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.042
[grunts]

06:51.044 --> 06:52.778
You all right?

06:52.780 --> 06:53.812
Yeah.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.180
Don't overexert yourself.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.249
I can't believe you got us out of roaming.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.350
Huh?

06:58.352 --> 07:00.318
Never been out of roaming. That even possible?

07:00.320 --> 07:02.254
Where are you going? What are you doing?

07:02.256 --> 07:04.956
I'm gonna go up here and see if I can get a signal.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.591
No! Let's sit, and let's wait

07:06.593 --> 07:07.793
a few minutes, man.

07:07.795 --> 07:08.794
Well, why?

07:08.796 --> 07:10.228
[sighs] I don't know.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.564
We'll hang, and we'll wait for a car.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.665
No, you sit and wait.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.033
I'm gonna go up and check.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.471
Ah, shit.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.247
You remember last time we drove cross-country

07:29.249 --> 07:32.217
and we went, like, 200 miles out of the way

07:32.219 --> 07:34.786
because we were so into
whatever we were talking about?

07:34.788 --> 07:38.123
Yeah, and now neither one of
us can remember what it was.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.691
Might have been when, uh...

07:39.693 --> 07:43.562
Might have been when you
claimed that art can reach a point

07:43.564 --> 07:46.164
where its quality became fact rather than opinion.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.733
That sounds like a couple hours of my life

07:48.735 --> 07:49.901
I'd like to have back.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.103
Or it might have been better defense,

07:52.105 --> 07:53.839
'85 Bears or Steel Curtain?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.407
Ah, that's hardly debatable.

07:55.409 --> 07:57.042
- Bears.
- Yeah.

07:57.044 --> 08:00.045
Well, there hasn't been much of that this time.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.146
What? Pointless conversation?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.614
Any conversation.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.717
How are things in high finance?

08:05.719 --> 08:07.519
Ah, put it this way...

08:07.521 --> 08:10.722
there's this motivational poster in my office

08:10.724 --> 08:13.024
with, like, this eagle

08:13.026 --> 08:14.626
soaring out of the sky and shit.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.694
Yeah.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.462
I'll spend some days just staring at it,

08:17.464 --> 08:19.064
trying to decide whether or not

08:19.066 --> 08:20.832
I'm more suicidal or homicidal that day.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.967
Nice!

08:21.969 --> 08:23.535
So quit.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.471
Quit? And do what?

08:26.473 --> 08:30.308
You ever do that thing when
you were in second grade,

08:30.310 --> 08:32.010
where you, like, drew a picture

08:32.011 --> 08:35.746
of... of what you wanted to be
when you were adult, you know?

08:35.749 --> 08:41.419
Like, I heard that that's the truest
reflection of what you really want.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.422
Like, if you're doing what you drew back then,

08:44.424 --> 08:46.091
then you're probably really happy.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.792
Yeah? And what'd you draw?

08:47.794 --> 08:48.994
Me?

08:48.996 --> 08:51.062
I think I drew a fat, unemployed writer,

08:51.064 --> 08:52.097
so I'm killing it.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.165
[both laugh]

08:54.167 --> 08:56.368
[wind blowing]

09:03.442 --> 09:05.110
Come on.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.413
Nothing.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.219
[crutches clattering]

09:16.556 --> 09:18.557
[wind blowing]

09:21.360 --> 09:24.095
So Joanne didn't like your music, huh?

09:24.097 --> 09:26.731
We just have different tastes.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.668
More likely, she has taste.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.003
Well, I liked it.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.004
Karen liked it.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.272
Would you stop that?

09:34.274 --> 09:35.373
What, man? I mean...

09:35.375 --> 09:36.575
Joanne didn't like your music,

09:36.577 --> 09:38.443
and she made you get rid of your guitars.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.312
I'm just trying to get up to speed here.

09:40.314 --> 09:41.846
No, she didn't make me do anything.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.014
It became clear that I wasn't

09:43.016 --> 09:44.516
gonna have a lot of chances to play,

09:44.518 --> 09:46.051
so I got rid of the stuff.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.819
You know, she's not a music critic.

09:47.821 --> 09:48.920
She's a receptionist.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.855
She's my wife, Carter, my wife.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.023
I'm just saying.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.592
I know exactly what you're saying,

09:53.594 --> 09:55.226
and I'm telling you to stop.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.429
[both panting]

10:00.600 --> 10:03.001
Davey said he saw you guys at the store,

10:03.003 --> 10:05.870
but you just kind of walked right on by.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.439
Yeah? Well, tell him I say hello.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.940
Why don't you tell him?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.376
You live less than, like,
10 miles away from the guy.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.577
Yeah, we're pretty busy.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.480
Well, he thinks that your wife hates him.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.715
- No.
- No?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.917
She's just not much on gatherings, that's all.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.318
What about your parents' house?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.220
There's never less than a hundred people there.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.022
Ah, we don't visit very often.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.156
[laughs] Okay.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.626
Uh, so no Davey, no family.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.461
Sounds like the list of people she does like

10:29.463 --> 10:31.429
is kind of short. I hope you're on it, buddy.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.764
Seriously, would you knock it off?

10:32.766 --> 10:33.765
[laughs]

10:33.767 --> 10:35.200
You don't even know her.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.735
You're right, man. I don't know her.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.204
Every time I come to visit you guys,
you're too busy.

10:39.206 --> 10:42.107
I'm surprised she let you get
away to do this thing with me.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.642
Here we go! Here we go!

10:43.644 --> 10:46.211
Oh, thank God. Come on. Here we go.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.679
Whoa. Wait a minute.

10:47.681 --> 10:48.947
Oh, shit. Wait. Wait.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.215
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

10:50.217 --> 10:51.816
God damn it!

10:51.818 --> 10:53.785
Agh! Ow!

10:53.787 --> 10:56.054
[groans] God damn it!

10:56.056 --> 10:57.155
Dude, are you okay?

10:57.157 --> 10:58.156
[both grunt]

10:58.158 --> 10:59.157
Hold up!

10:59.159 --> 11:01.026
CARTER: Hold on!

11:01.028 --> 11:03.161
Shit! Hold on!

11:03.996 --> 11:05.563
CARTER: Wait. Wait!

11:05.565 --> 11:07.632
Hey! Wait!

11:07.634 --> 11:08.633
Hey!

11:08.635 --> 11:09.968
Hold on!

11:09.970 --> 11:10.969
Hey!

11:10.971 --> 11:12.170
Yo.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.740
[grunting] Whoa. Whoa.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.045
Hey. Car trouble?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.212
Yeah. We, uh...

11:21.214 --> 11:23.314
We broke down a few minutes ago.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.316
Well, I... I'm not much good on cars.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.785
I'll give you a lift into town.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.486
That would be great. Thank you so much.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.088
Just let me grab my bag.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.656
Hey! Look, a ride. Wait! Wait!

11:31.658 --> 11:32.590
Sorry.

11:32.592 --> 11:33.758
Hold on. We don't need it.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.627
What do you mean we don't need it?

11:35.629 --> 11:36.428
Sorry, sir.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.629
Nothing to worry about, son.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.064
I... I'm harmless. No, it's not...

11:39.066 --> 11:41.733
[laughs] No. I, uh...

11:41.735 --> 11:42.834
No, it's all right.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.936
It's not that. It's just that the...

11:46.105 --> 11:47.806
The truck, it's not broken.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.041
What do you mean it's not broken?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.242
It's... I took a wire out.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.377
It's not a big deal.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.712
What are you talk... Um...

11:54.747 --> 11:55.847
One second.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.182
What are you talking about?

11:57.184 --> 11:59.384
I thought that we were gonna
have some good conversations

11:59.386 --> 12:00.752
like the last time, you know?

12:00.754 --> 12:03.221
But instead I got cellphones and freeways

12:03.223 --> 12:04.723
and motels and fucking sports radio.

12:04.725 --> 12:08.126
And, uh, I mean, I tried to get off the beaten path.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.594
You just decided to go to sleep,

12:09.596 --> 12:12.330
so I thought this would give
us a chance to catch up.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.331
Thank you, sir.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.799
Are you out of your f...

12:14.801 --> 12:16.501
You sure everything's all right? Yes. Oh, yeah.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.771
I... I am definitely sure.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.005
Okay.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.540
Ta-da. All right, thank you.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.309
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

12:24.311 --> 12:25.310
Put it in.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.544
It's no big deal, man.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.880
Put it in! I want to see it start.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.116
It's just a wire.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.350
Sorry about this.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.385
Just give us a second.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.656
It's just a wire, man.

12:38.658 --> 12:39.891
- Look.
- Okay.

12:41.627 --> 12:43.294
Here.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.001
[whistling a tune]

12:56.342 --> 13:00.044
[engine starts]

13:04.016 --> 13:05.216
Happy?

13:05.218 --> 13:06.217
You boys good?

13:06.219 --> 13:07.218
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.053
Thank you. Thank you so much.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.156
I appreciate it. Have a good day.

13:11.158 --> 13:14.626
Sorry. Thank you for stopping.

13:19.732 --> 13:20.732
Are you insane?!

13:21.767 --> 13:22.600
Huh?

13:22.602 --> 13:23.968
You stage a breakdown

13:23.970 --> 13:25.136
in the middle of the desert

13:25.138 --> 13:26.838
so that we can talk?

13:26.840 --> 13:29.207
Yeah, and we've had our longest
conversation in the whole trip.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.775
I guess that's a coincidence.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.811
I could have broken my neck
falling down that goddamn hill.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.946
I told you not go up there. We could have had

13:34.948 --> 13:36.614
a perfectly good talk sitting right here... Talk?!

13:36.616 --> 13:38.983
but you had to go up and
climb a fricking mountain.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.451
That was not a talk.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.487
That was you stopping us a
hundred miles from nowhere

13:42.489 --> 13:44.355
so that you could spend a
few uninterrupted minutes

13:44.357 --> 13:46.958
bashing my wife and job!

13:49.562 --> 13:51.429
[turns off engine]

13:53.666 --> 13:55.633
What kind of a ring was it?

13:55.635 --> 13:56.734
What?

13:56.736 --> 13:59.204
The engagement ring. What kind was it?

13:59.206 --> 14:01.039
What do you mean, what kind?

14:01.041 --> 14:02.240
Was it a diamond?

14:02.242 --> 14:03.508
Why does that matter?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.742
Why won't you answer?

14:04.744 --> 14:07.145
Fine. I got her a diamond. So what?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.646
"So what?"
So you just forgot

14:08.648 --> 14:10.148
all about the gumball doctrine?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.282
The gumball doc...

14:11.284 --> 14:13.585
Oh, my God. You gotta be kidding me.

14:13.587 --> 14:16.521
Has nothing happened to you in the last 10 years?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.755
So you do remember?

14:17.757 --> 14:19.524
Yeah, I remember it as something cooked up

14:19.526 --> 14:22.727
by a couple of losers who had
nothing better to do on a Friday night.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.229
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. I didn't cook it up.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.898
You did. You're the one. You're the one that said

14:26.900 --> 14:28.867
that you would never buy an engagement ring

14:28.869 --> 14:30.668
that didn't come from a gumball machine.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.238
You're the one that said the
poorest people on the planet

14:33.240 --> 14:34.772
are hacking off each others' limbs

14:34.774 --> 14:37.175
to give you something to
spend two months' salary on.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.344
Look, just because you took
some conversation we had

14:39.346 --> 14:42.080
over beer and macaroni and
decided to make it your religion

14:42.082 --> 14:44.649
doesn't mean the rest of the world gives a shit.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.818
Okay, fine. So you gave up on diamonds.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.820
Okay. Who gives a shit, man?

14:48.822 --> 14:52.824
You give up on your music,
your friends and your family,

14:52.826 --> 14:54.759
and for what, the rebound girl?

14:54.761 --> 14:56.294
- Come on.
- The rebound girl?

14:56.296 --> 14:57.295
- Yes.
- Really?

14:57.297 --> 14:59.297
Yes, the rebound girl.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.331
I was there.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.833
I saw you and Karen together.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.601
You were insane for the girl.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.570
And... and when she left, you know...

15:05.572 --> 15:08.373
[scoffs] You were messed up.
Okay? People get that.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.576
But four months later,
and you're engaged to the secretary?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.144
Listen, take a step back,

15:13.146 --> 15:14.746
and see that for what it is.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.714
I fell in love. You panicked.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.016
Why do you insist on listening

15:18.018 --> 15:19.717
to the words you're putting into my mouth

15:19.719 --> 15:21.920
rather than the ones I'm actually saying?

15:21.922 --> 15:23.388
You got a goddamn dog.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.822
- So what?
- You're allergic!

15:24.824 --> 15:26.324
Take a pill.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.458
What's the dog's name?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.060
Sun... Fuck you.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.061
No.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.162
No, "Fuck You"...

15:31.164 --> 15:32.630
No, "Fuck You," I would believe.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.532
"Fuck You" is exactly the kind of name

15:34.534 --> 15:35.867
that you would name a dog.

15:35.869 --> 15:39.804
No, but your dog's name is Sunshine.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.005
[laughs]

15:41.007 --> 15:42.173
Fucking Sunshine.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.676
Are you gonna look at me with a straight face

15:44.678 --> 15:46.878
and tell me that your opinion
was actually considered

15:46.880 --> 15:49.147
in the decision that resulted in an animal

15:49.149 --> 15:51.816
you're allergic to being named after a Care Bear?

15:51.818 --> 15:54.052
Oh, my God, you're right.
I didn't get to name the dog.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.119
My life is a sham.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.188
No, no, let me just get this straight, okay?

15:57.190 --> 15:58.323
J... Just for me.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.391
So the love of your life leaves.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.961
Okay? And, um, less than a year later,

16:02.963 --> 16:05.063
you're married to a secretary

16:05.065 --> 16:08.299
who loves dogs and hates your fucking music.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.102
I think it's reasonable at that
point to have some doubts, right?

16:11.104 --> 16:14.639
I think it's reasonable to
email your good friend Carter.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.640
You remember that?

16:15.642 --> 16:16.941
"Hey, what the fuck, man?

16:16.943 --> 16:19.911
What am I getting into? Did I make a mistake?"

16:19.913 --> 16:22.914
And before I can hit reply,
you buy a fucking house!

16:22.916 --> 16:25.183
That's great! I understand.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.451
Right. Okay, fine. You're...

16:26.453 --> 16:27.719
Focus on...

16:27.721 --> 16:29.253
You want to focus on fucking square footage,

16:29.255 --> 16:31.489
rather than the fact that you
have nothing in common.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.657
That's okay. You...

16:32.659 --> 16:34.392
It's marriage counseling by HGTV.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.661
I get it, man. I get it.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.297
And now, you know,
after all this home improvement,

16:39.299 --> 16:40.498
you realize, you know,

16:40.500 --> 16:42.467
you haven't improved a goddamn thing.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.302
And now you got no distractions.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.970
"What am I gonna do?"

16:45.972 --> 16:47.305
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.508
It's the next chapter in the off-the-shelf life plan

16:50.510 --> 16:51.976
you got from Home Depot!

16:51.978 --> 16:54.045
Right. Procreate!

16:54.047 --> 16:56.514
That's the job that's never finished.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.815
"Keep my face down.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.684
Keep my nose to the grindstone."

16:59.686 --> 17:01.052
Just focused on the kid,

17:01.054 --> 17:03.688
and maybe you can go the rest of your life

17:03.690 --> 17:06.391
ignoring the fact that you fucked up, man.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.291
You made a colossal mistake,

17:08.294 --> 17:09.394
and you married, literally,

17:09.396 --> 17:11.029
the first chick to come along.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.164
- What... Hey, hey. Come on. Come on.
- Fucking...

17:13.165 --> 17:15.532
I'm not saying anything you don't know already.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.669
Just swallow your pride,
and you'll see how true it is.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.271
You ever talk about my family like that again,

17:20.272 --> 17:22.607
I will kick the shit out of you. You hear me?

17:22.608 --> 17:23.808
Okay. All right.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.810
Listen, I'm sure that Cole is great.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.881
I'm sure he's the best thing to ever happen to you,

17:29.883 --> 17:33.084
but he's not a substitute for loving your wife.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.486
Joanne was right.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.955
You're nothing but a piece of shit.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.360
Okay.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.428
- That's okay.
- Get in!

17:43.430 --> 17:44.862
I'll get in when I'm...

17:44.864 --> 17:46.731
I'll get in when I'm good and fucking ready.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.199
That's when I'll get in.

17:51.036 --> 17:53.671
So it's you and Joanne against the whole world.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.006
That's all right. That's okay.

17:55.008 --> 17:56.407
You know, you're so scared

17:56.409 --> 17:58.042
to admit that you made a mistake,

17:58.044 --> 18:00.745
that you just keep on making it
over and over and over again.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.246
But that's fine. That's fine.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.450
You want to keep on believing your own bullshit,

18:05.452 --> 18:06.717
we'll get you home,

18:06.719 --> 18:09.454
get you back to your perfect little life

18:09.456 --> 18:10.922
and your "motivational posters,"

18:10.924 --> 18:13.024
and you can tune back out and...

18:13.026 --> 18:15.159
and try to forget all about the fact

18:15.161 --> 18:17.295
that your life is a complete shit hole.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.098
Then maybe, maybe you can call me in 20 years

18:20.100 --> 18:21.866
when you've fucking lost your hair

18:21.868 --> 18:24.235
and you've come to your senses.

18:24.237 --> 18:27.371
I don't think we'll be talking much anymore.

18:27.373 --> 18:28.673
Whatever.

18:29.475 --> 18:32.376
[engine grinding]

18:33.779 --> 18:36.481
[engine clunks]

18:36.483 --> 18:38.483
Stupid motherfucker.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.318
It probably just came loose, man.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.319
Are you insane!

18:41.321 --> 18:42.320
Calm down!

18:42.322 --> 18:43.354
Why are you... calm down?

18:43.356 --> 18:44.789
You want me to calm down?!

18:44.791 --> 18:46.724
You go fucking around with the electrical system

18:46.726 --> 18:48.259
in a 30-year-old piece-of-shit truck

18:48.261 --> 18:51.028
in the middle of the desert
with no food and no water,

18:51.030 --> 18:52.597
and I'm supposed to calm down!

18:52.599 --> 18:54.632
I didn't fuck around with it. I disabled it, briefly.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.001
You should be thankful that
I'm willing to go to these...

18:57.003 --> 18:58.002
Thankful! I should be thankful?!

18:58.004 --> 18:59.370
lengths to try to help you.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.771
Who the fuck are you

19:00.773 --> 19:03.841
to be giving me some sort
of life intervention, huh?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.143
You're unemployed!

19:05.145 --> 19:05.943
You're homeless!

19:05.945 --> 19:07.645
Yes, and you hate your job,

19:07.647 --> 19:10.915
and you have a house that's
apparently too small for a guitar!

19:10.917 --> 19:13.351
This is so typical. This is so typical.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.353
You're constantly doing something for you

19:15.355 --> 19:17.655
and then saying that it's for everybody else.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.990
[engine grinding] You don't like my wife,

19:18.992 --> 19:20.525
we don't get to hang out anymore,

19:20.527 --> 19:21.859
so you want me to get divorced,

19:21.861 --> 19:22.960
right, for my own good...

19:22.962 --> 19:24.328
Yeah. because I can do better,

19:24.330 --> 19:25.663
but it's all bullshit.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.532
You want me to find somebody you like better.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.000
It's for your own good.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.134
Fuck. Fuck. Shit.
[sighs]

19:30.136 --> 19:32.003
I got a good job. I make good money.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.005
I have a house, a family, and it kills you,

19:34.007 --> 19:36.007
because you're a 30-year-old
failure who lives in his car.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.775
- Right.
- So you turn your anger on everybody else

19:37.777 --> 19:40.678
and try to make us feel like our
achievements aren't worth a shit

19:40.680 --> 19:41.946
because we didn't draw a picture

19:41.948 --> 19:44.015
of ourselves doing them in the second grade.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.683
You actually think that if I quit,

19:45.685 --> 19:47.018
took up music and actually made it,

19:47.020 --> 19:48.386
that you'd be happy for me?

19:48.388 --> 19:49.720
- Mm.
- Fuck that. You would be

19:49.722 --> 19:51.856
just as blind with jealousy then as you are now.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.057
You'd probably... I don't know...

19:53.059 --> 19:54.825
run me over with your car-slash-house...

19:54.827 --> 19:56.093
- Probably.
- And then tell me

19:56.095 --> 19:58.262
that it was for my own good, right?

19:58.264 --> 19:59.263
Yeah.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.798
This is not about me.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.333
You don't give a shit about me.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.601
This is all about you

20:03.603 --> 20:05.503
and how everybody else can
accommodate your failure.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.105
Hey, I'm not a failure, okay?

20:08.107 --> 20:10.608
I could have everything you have and more,

20:10.610 --> 20:14.212
but I decided long ago that it would
be better to follow my dream

20:14.214 --> 20:17.315
rather than try to buy enough
shit from fucking Pottery Barn

20:17.317 --> 20:19.850
to be comfortable with the idea of being

20:19.852 --> 20:23.821
a meaningless, lever-pulling, button-pushing cog!

20:23.823 --> 20:25.823
I was a day away from...

20:25.825 --> 20:27.291
- From law school.
- No, no.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.526
We all know the story.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.027
Fuck!

20:30.029 --> 20:32.730
You took a test. You blew it away.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.198
You had your choice of schools,

20:34.200 --> 20:36.801
but walked away for the sake of art, right? Right?

20:36.803 --> 20:38.936
I followed my dream instead of a paycheck.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.838
Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. Enh! Wrong.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.707
You're a scared and insecure little freak

20:42.709 --> 20:44.308
who couldn't get anywhere with writing

20:44.310 --> 20:46.944
and so desperately needed
somebody to approve of you,

20:46.946 --> 20:48.913
to say that you were still intelligent,

20:48.915 --> 20:49.947
- still capable...
- Come on.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.482
that you took a fricking test.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.950
You know what you should do?

20:52.952 --> 20:54.685
You should tattoo that test score on your forehead.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.588
That way, when somebody says,
"Wait a second. You live in your car?"

20:57.590 --> 20:58.889
You can say, "Yeah, but look.

20:58.891 --> 21:02.426
I chose to be a loser, so its okay."
[scoffs]

21:02.428 --> 21:03.928
[spits]

21:03.930 --> 21:05.963
You think you've got the rest of us pegged, right?

21:05.965 --> 21:07.498
You got the rest of us pegged,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.867
and it's your job to make sure we all face reality?

21:09.869 --> 21:11.535
The reality is your writing sucks.

21:11.537 --> 21:13.904
You're not gonna be famous.
You're not gonna sell a book.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.306
You are wasting your time.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.174
You're the one that needs to face facts, pal.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.876
But every time those facts get too close,

21:18.878 --> 21:20.878
you just hop in your car, and you run off.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.046
Well, here are the facts.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.614
A 30-year-old loser living in his car

21:23.616 --> 21:25.983
is about the last person that
I'm gonna be looking to

21:25.985 --> 21:27.485
for advice on how to fix my life.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.854
So unless you want to put out a book of don'ts

21:29.856 --> 21:31.422
based on all the ways you screwed up,

21:31.424 --> 21:33.424
which is the only thing
you're ever likely to publish,

21:33.426 --> 21:35.359
you should probably just shut the fuck up.

21:39.331 --> 21:40.464
Are you done?

21:42.768 --> 21:44.969
[engine grinding]

21:45.804 --> 21:48.039
[clunk]

21:49.107 --> 21:51.475
Fuck!

21:53.745 --> 21:56.447
[yells]

21:56.449 --> 21:57.882
[groans]

22:02.654 --> 22:04.422
Shit. Shit.

22:20.205 --> 22:21.605
[coughs]

22:23.842 --> 22:25.443
Shit. Sh...

22:30.382 --> 22:32.383
[steam hissing]

22:38.590 --> 22:41.158
[wind blowing]

22:41.160 --> 22:42.460
Someone'll come along.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.130
You make me sick.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.502
[music playing]

24:05.844 --> 24:08.045
[wind blowing]

24:12.784 --> 24:14.985
[breathing heavily]

24:38.076 --> 24:40.344
[grunting]

24:54.993 --> 24:56.527
[grunts]

24:56.529 --> 24:58.529
[panting]

25:02.434 --> 25:04.335
Hot enough for ya?

25:09.808 --> 25:12.476
They say the nights kill
more people than the days.

25:15.547 --> 25:16.680
CARTER: Okay.

25:19.618 --> 25:20.551
I'm so thirsty.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.486
My tongue feels like a two-by-four.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.788
Here.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.066
Eh...

25:48.980 --> 25:50.781
Man, finish it.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.555
How long can you go without water?

25:57.557 --> 25:59.056
Two days?

25:59.058 --> 26:00.457
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

26:00.459 --> 26:01.926
I'm going for help in the morning.

26:01.928 --> 26:05.095
Oh, 60 miles is a pretty long walk.

26:05.097 --> 26:08.265
That's only if I don't see a car.

26:08.267 --> 26:11.068
I think I saw some cones on the way in, man.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.503
I don't know.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.008
Hey, I know it...

26:18.010 --> 26:22.079
I know it doesn't really change anything, but, uh...

26:22.081 --> 26:23.547
I'm sorry.

26:26.217 --> 26:29.119
It was definitely not your brightest idea.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.622
I mean I'm sorry about what I said.

26:32.691 --> 26:34.758
Are you sure you don't want to apologize

26:34.760 --> 26:36.293
for getting us stuck?

26:36.295 --> 26:39.129
I'm not freezing to death
because you insulted my wife.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.733
I'm sorry about the whole goddamn thing.

26:46.905 --> 26:49.006
You really think my writing sucks?

26:49.008 --> 26:50.841
It's... It's not bad.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.309
It's just...

26:53.645 --> 26:57.214
all... all your characters get, like, cancer and die.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.716
Don't all get cancer and die.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.217
In that one thing, I'm pretty sure

27:00.219 --> 27:01.385
about 75 % of the people die...

27:01.387 --> 27:04.021
That was about an oncologist.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.522
Yeah, and that other one with the woman

27:05.524 --> 27:07.524
who was high and her baby
crawled out the window.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.493
I mean, it was good writing, but...

27:09.495 --> 27:11.328
kind made me want to kill myself.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.198
Look, that shit really happens, all right?

27:14.200 --> 27:19.136
It's just hard to get the message
out if nobody reads the book.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.872
The idea that "I might not have it,"

27:21.874 --> 27:24.508
it's... it's not news.

27:24.510 --> 27:27.144
[sighs] It's just that...

27:27.146 --> 27:29.847
you go your whole life with everyone

27:29.849 --> 27:33.617
yelling at you to follow your
dream and then to never give up.

27:33.619 --> 27:36.453
But to be honest,
if everyone followed their dreams,

27:36.455 --> 27:39.189
we'd just be a planet of pro athletes and...

27:39.191 --> 27:40.524
and astronauts.

27:40.526 --> 27:41.625
[laughs]

27:41.627 --> 27:43.994
You know, there's gotta be someone there

27:43.996 --> 27:46.196
to clean the toilets, am I right?

27:46.198 --> 27:47.831
It's like you said, you know.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.701
Sometimes it's better to go
after something you care about

27:50.703 --> 27:53.470
than to be handed something
that you don't, right?

27:53.472 --> 27:54.405
Really?

27:54.407 --> 27:56.140
What if my lifelong dream

27:56.142 --> 27:58.142
was to be point guard for the Lakers?

27:58.144 --> 28:00.411
Would you tell me to keep chasing that?

28:00.413 --> 28:01.679
No.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.247
Exactly.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.448
Because "Never give up"

28:04.450 --> 28:06.450
looks a hell of a lot better

28:06.452 --> 28:08.786
on a coffee mug than it does in real life.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.821
Because failing...

28:12.524 --> 28:16.360
daily failing, it's... it's just...

28:16.362 --> 28:19.129
it's a lonely...

28:19.131 --> 28:21.031
miserable business.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.599
[wind howling]

28:22.601 --> 28:26.804
Look man, if I thought you should quit,
I would say so.

28:29.007 --> 28:33.143
But sometimes, you know,
inside all that other stuff,

28:33.145 --> 28:34.545
sometimes...

28:34.547 --> 28:37.247
you'll say something in just a few words

28:37.249 --> 28:39.416
that I realize I've been thinking for years.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.585
And that's not just you reading my mind.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.487
That's you reading a part of it

28:43.489 --> 28:45.923
that I never would have known how to express.

28:45.925 --> 28:49.226
Now, that's not just some
fat kid with no jump shot.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.227
That's...

28:50.229 --> 28:52.463
There's something there.

28:52.465 --> 28:55.766
Some of the things you put out there, man...

28:56.968 --> 29:00.471
I think a lot more of them stick than you realize.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.614
I cheated on Joanne.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.184
Are you kidding me?

29:14.186 --> 29:15.786
No.

29:15.788 --> 29:18.255
Six months ago at this conference.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.891
Just...

29:20.893 --> 29:22.593
just sort of happened.

29:24.028 --> 29:26.396
We're freezing our asses off
in the middle of the desert.

29:26.398 --> 29:27.931
You think you're gonna get away with,

29:27.933 --> 29:28.932
"It just sort of happened?"

29:30.101 --> 29:31.835
It was just...

29:31.837 --> 29:33.403
It was this woman...

29:33.405 --> 29:35.239
Girl, really, 21, 22,

29:35.241 --> 29:36.840
somebody's intern.

29:36.842 --> 29:37.841
[wind continues blowing]

29:37.843 --> 29:40.077
Long brown hair, these long, skinny legs,

29:40.079 --> 29:42.713
and she had this huge smile.

29:42.715 --> 29:44.882
And she walks up to me,
and she introduces herself,

29:44.884 --> 29:48.051
asks what firm I'm with, blah, blah, blah.
And I said, like,

29:48.053 --> 29:51.555
"Listen, if... if you're looking for a job,
I'm the wrong guy,"

29:51.557 --> 29:54.992
and she goes,
"No, I just think you look interesting."

29:54.994 --> 29:57.294
And she says, "Would you like to have dinner?"

29:57.296 --> 30:00.864
And I realize that I've had my hands
in my pockets this whole time,

30:00.866 --> 30:03.267
so she has no idea that I'm even married.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.501
Mm-hmm.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.003
And suddenly I get this feeling, you know,

30:06.005 --> 30:08.338
like I told you I get with books and movies,

30:08.340 --> 30:10.274
like I... I finally had a chance to escape,

30:10.276 --> 30:12.109
to be somebody else for a while.

30:12.111 --> 30:14.545
So I go back up to my room,

30:14.547 --> 30:17.481
and suddenly I feel this wave of guilt,

30:17.483 --> 30:19.383
like the spell breaks,

30:19.385 --> 30:21.185
and I start thinking this is crazy.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.619
Then all of a sudden,

30:22.621 --> 30:25.389
my phone rings, and it's Joanne.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.791
And I answer, and I say,

30:27.793 --> 30:30.694
"I'm so glad you called," because I was.

30:30.696 --> 30:33.530
"I miss you, and I wish you were here right now."

30:33.532 --> 30:35.933
And she says,
"Well, I wish I were there right now, too,

30:35.935 --> 30:37.267
because the disposal's broken again."

30:37.269 --> 30:38.535
"Do you want me to call a repairman,

30:38.537 --> 30:39.937
or do you want to try and fix it?"

30:39.939 --> 30:41.972
"Oh, and did you ever talk to our neighbor

30:41.974 --> 30:44.141
about whether or not they stole our recycling bin?"

30:44.143 --> 30:46.710
"Because it's getting a little awkward walking with..."

30:46.712 --> 30:49.046
And she goes on like this for, like, five minutes.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.247
[laughs]

30:50.249 --> 30:51.882
[sighs]

30:51.884 --> 30:55.652
So when I hung up,

30:55.654 --> 30:57.721
I practically ran to the elevator.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.957
And Annie... her name was Annie...

30:59.959 --> 31:01.625
we have this whole dinner,

31:01.627 --> 31:04.094
and you know what we talked about?

31:04.096 --> 31:05.195
College football.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.130
- College football.
- Mm.

31:07.132 --> 31:08.932
No car insurance, no day care,

31:08.934 --> 31:11.935
no gossip about other parents I don't even know.

31:11.937 --> 31:14.638
Just simple, effortless conversation. I've never...

31:16.741 --> 31:20.310
The first one that I've had in a long time.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.346
Scale of 1 to 10?

31:22.348 --> 31:23.380
10.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.915
Plus the fact that she was 21,

31:24.917 --> 31:26.283
makes her, like, an eleventy-zillion.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.051
Hello.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.386
Don't get me wrong.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.356
Joanne is very attractive.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.958
And this is gonna sound shallow, but...

31:38.096 --> 31:40.697
pregnancy is bad for a body.

31:41.766 --> 31:43.767
You know, sometimes I'll catch myself

31:43.769 --> 31:47.170
staring at her thighs or belly,

31:47.172 --> 31:48.605
and I'll be like...

31:48.607 --> 31:51.808
whatever happened to the
woman I married, you know?

31:53.144 --> 31:56.213
You do realize you're the
one who made her like that.

31:56.215 --> 31:59.816
I know.
That's why I feel like an asshole even saying this.

31:59.818 --> 32:02.219
I feel like an asshole even thinking it.

32:02.221 --> 32:03.654
And don't get me wrong.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.689
Cole is the best thing that's ever happened to me.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.224
It's just he's the worst thing

32:07.226 --> 32:08.926
that ever happened to our sex life.

32:08.928 --> 32:12.062
I used to look at Joanne and just want to jump her,

32:12.064 --> 32:15.332
but now I look at her, and sometimes...

32:15.334 --> 32:17.901
And this is embarrassing, but sometimes

32:17.903 --> 32:20.470
I have trouble...

32:20.472 --> 32:23.440
getting ready for her.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.677
And Annie?

32:26.679 --> 32:28.845
[scoffs] I could be ready just thinking about her.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.681
I was ready when she asked my name.

32:30.683 --> 32:33.450
I guess when you get married,

32:33.452 --> 32:36.119
you're supposed to say that the relationship

32:36.121 --> 32:39.823
goes beyond tight thighs and a skinny waist

32:39.825 --> 32:41.258
and that, when all that goes,

32:41.260 --> 32:42.693
the rest of it will sustain you.

32:42.695 --> 32:44.328
Well, it just isn't phrased that way.

32:44.330 --> 32:47.164
But if... if it was, would you still have married her?

32:47.166 --> 32:48.732
Yeah, of course, but...

32:48.734 --> 32:51.735
you just don't realize
how much you'll miss things,

32:51.737 --> 32:53.570
you know, little things, like kissing.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.472
Y... You don't kiss Joanne anymore?

32:55.474 --> 32:56.907
Yeah, we kiss all the time,

32:56.909 --> 32:58.875
but it's habit. It's like a handshake.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.510
You don't even think about it.

33:00.512 --> 33:01.712
But when Annie kissed me...

33:01.714 --> 33:03.213
[head pounds] Fuck.

33:03.215 --> 33:07.217
It was like the hairs on the
back of my neck stood up.

33:07.219 --> 33:10.287
It's hard to say, but there's more
in that first kiss with someone new

33:10.289 --> 33:12.723
than there is in the whole
shebang after four years.

33:12.725 --> 33:14.024
That's how everything was.

33:14.026 --> 33:15.959
It was just exciting, you know, touching her,

33:15.961 --> 33:17.828
taking her clothes off for the first time.

33:17.830 --> 33:21.765
And then the... the rest of the weekend at...
at the conference,

33:21.767 --> 33:24.001
I'd be sitting in some stupid speech,

33:24.003 --> 33:27.371
and all I could think about was those tiny,
little legs

33:27.373 --> 33:28.739
and those little black panties,

33:28.741 --> 33:31.942
and I just... I felt like I was going fucking crazy.

33:31.944 --> 33:32.809
[sighs]

33:32.811 --> 33:34.911
So then, at lunch, I found her...

33:36.748 --> 33:39.383
and we blew off the rest of the conference,

33:39.385 --> 33:41.351
just blew it off.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.186
Did it four times on Sunday...

33:44.789 --> 33:46.923
once an hour before we went to the airport.

33:46.925 --> 33:48.658
Now, you have to understand,

33:48.660 --> 33:51.461
if Joanne and I do it four times a month,

33:51.463 --> 33:53.096
it's a fucking miracle.

33:53.098 --> 33:56.666
But it's like I knew that it
was gonna disappear forever,

33:56.668 --> 33:59.803
and I just... I couldn't get enough.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.805
And did it disappear forever?

34:01.807 --> 34:05.008
Yeah, we email sometimes, but...

34:05.010 --> 34:06.676
nothing serious.

34:06.678 --> 34:09.413
But every time I see her name in my in-box,

34:09.415 --> 34:11.281
it's like my heart doubles up, man.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.916
Are you gonna see her again?

34:12.918 --> 34:15.418
Why? That would just ruin it, you know?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.822
Everything I felt for Annie,
I used to feel for Joanne.

34:18.824 --> 34:23.159
So, what, I just run off with this
gorgeous little football fan. Then what?

34:23.161 --> 34:26.797
Next thing you know,
talking to Annie is like talking to Joanne,

34:26.799 --> 34:29.266
kissing Annie is like kissing Joanne. It's...

34:30.668 --> 34:33.235
That's just what marriage does.

34:36.774 --> 34:40.143
You asked if I ever mention the music to Joanne.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.143
Well, I have.

34:41.146 --> 34:42.579
Hmm.
I do.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.147
It's like clockwork.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.784
Every couple of months, I'll wake up,

34:47.786 --> 34:50.754
freaked out that my life is meaningless.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.123
She'll try on some clothes, have a breakdown,

34:53.125 --> 34:56.025
swear she's gonna lose 20 pounds,
swears off food.

34:56.027 --> 35:00.163
I swear that I'm gonna turn in
my tie for a guitar strap.

35:00.165 --> 35:02.432
We both say, "Good for you, honey. I'm with you,"

35:02.434 --> 35:06.670
not believing a single fucking
word the other person's saying.

35:06.672 --> 35:09.940
That's the problem with marriage. You...

35:09.942 --> 35:12.309
You can't do it without learning to lie

35:12.311 --> 35:15.245
to the one person you're supposed to trust.

35:16.481 --> 35:18.014
Can I ask you something?

35:18.016 --> 35:19.149
What?

35:19.151 --> 35:22.886
And I don't... I don't mean to upset you.

35:22.888 --> 35:23.987
Um...

35:23.989 --> 35:26.923
if it's so bad, why don't you get out?

35:28.326 --> 35:29.659
Let me see your keys.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.962
I told you, I tried a million times.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.063
Just... Just let me see 'em.

35:33.065 --> 35:34.364
It's not gonna work, brother.

35:36.367 --> 35:37.934
That's it?

35:37.936 --> 35:39.970
Two keys?

35:39.972 --> 35:41.138
Yeah, why?

35:42.773 --> 35:44.908
[keys clatter]

35:45.743 --> 35:46.910
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.645
It's like you mugged a locksmith.

35:48.647 --> 35:49.980
Yeah, I know. It's, uh...

35:49.982 --> 35:52.282
Okay, there's my... my house keys.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.817
I got my gym locker.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.285
I've got my toolshed.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.487
I've got my boat keys.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.456
I don't know what the hell that one's for...

35:59.458 --> 36:00.790
- Jesus.
- or that one.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.659
I mean, it's like...
You know when people say

36:02.661 --> 36:03.827
they're gonna put down roots?

36:03.829 --> 36:05.729
Well, that's what it looks like.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.068
Shit.

36:14.705 --> 36:17.007
You know what I always wanted?

36:17.009 --> 36:18.275
What?

36:18.277 --> 36:20.377
Mohawk, fucking Mohawk,

36:20.379 --> 36:24.915
just like that dude from... from "Taxi Driver."

36:24.917 --> 36:26.483
Travis Bickle? The nutcase?

36:26.485 --> 36:27.484
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

36:27.486 --> 36:28.985
But I could never do it.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.086
Why not?

36:30.088 --> 36:33.023
Well, because my parents would have killed me.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.858
Then when I got to college, I was working.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.160
Then I was working as soon as I got out of college.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.496
Then of course I got married and had a kid, so...

36:39.498 --> 36:41.064
So?

36:41.066 --> 36:43.900
So you don't see many responsible parents

36:43.902 --> 36:47.737
or functioning members of society with Mohawks.

36:48.573 --> 36:50.207
So?

36:50.209 --> 36:52.075
So forget about doing

36:52.077 --> 36:53.810
something crazy and life-altering

36:53.812 --> 36:56.279
like quitting my job or leaving my wife.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.682
I can't even get a haircut anymore

36:58.684 --> 37:00.083
without thinking about the keys,

37:00.085 --> 37:02.385
and the keys, they don't like Mohawks.

37:02.387 --> 37:06.056
Well, how long do you have
to listen to the keys exactly?

37:06.058 --> 37:08.792
U-Until you retire? Until Cole goes to college?

37:08.794 --> 37:11.294
Oh, I'll probably be bald by then.

37:11.296 --> 37:13.330
Exactly.

37:13.332 --> 37:17.834
You know,
I used to have something on my key chain,

37:17.836 --> 37:20.170
but it kept falling off.

37:21.772 --> 37:24.608
Do you know what this is?

37:24.610 --> 37:26.743
This is a multi-tool.

37:27.945 --> 37:31.281
And do you know what one of the tools is?

37:32.316 --> 37:34.417
Shing.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.452
Mohawk?

37:35.454 --> 37:37.721
Dude, put away the multi-tool.

37:37.723 --> 37:38.722
It's not happening.

37:38.724 --> 37:39.956
Why not?

37:39.958 --> 37:42.192
Because I just told you two pounds of why.

37:42.194 --> 37:43.293
So what, man? Nobody's here.

37:43.295 --> 37:44.494
We're freezing our asses off

37:44.496 --> 37:45.595
in the middle of the desert.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.830
There's not a soul to stop you.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.265
- Whoa.
- Mohawk!

37:48.267 --> 37:50.533
It's not something that I think Cole needs to see,

37:50.535 --> 37:51.968
is his old man with a Mohawk.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.703
So what? You'll... man, you'll...

37:53.705 --> 37:56.473
you'll prove to him that... that
it's good to be your own man.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.174
What about Joanne?

37:58.176 --> 38:00.744
Joanne's probably as bored
with you as you are of her.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.446
You're probably one Mohawk
away from fucking like rabbits.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.447
Okay, well...

38:04.449 --> 38:06.249
Mohawk! Mo...

38:06.251 --> 38:08.718
Come on. Just say fuck it, man.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.553
Fuck it. Fuck the keys.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.022
Do it for you.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.625
Oh, God, you don't...

38:15.627 --> 38:17.360
You're pulling on it.

38:17.362 --> 38:18.828
Just re... Just relax.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.196
Don't be a pussy.

38:20.198 --> 38:21.197
[sighs]

38:21.199 --> 38:22.198
There we go.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.701
Whee.
[laughs]

38:24.703 --> 38:26.169
That's looking good, man.

38:42.753 --> 38:44.654
Here we go.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.756
- [yelling]
- [yells]

38:46.758 --> 38:48.692
Ow!

38:48.694 --> 38:50.694
Yeah, that's gonna leave a mark.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.195
Are you fucking kidding me?

38:56.834 --> 38:57.834
Is it straight?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.336
It's fairly straight.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.538
Yeah? Does it look like Travis Bickle?

39:01.540 --> 39:02.806
Heh. You look pretty crazy.

39:02.808 --> 39:04.341
[laughs]

39:05.876 --> 39:07.277
What do you think? Oh, no.

39:07.279 --> 39:08.478
Do you love it?

39:08.480 --> 39:11.081
[both laugh]

39:11.083 --> 39:11.881
Yes.

39:11.883 --> 39:12.916
Oh, my God.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.217
I'll give you 100 bucks

39:14.219 --> 39:16.586
if you let me come to work with you on Monday.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.987
You don't have $100.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.756
I know! I'll sell something.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.391
You gonna sell a book?

39:21.393 --> 39:22.192
Something of value,

39:22.194 --> 39:25.228
like my kidney, maybe. God.

39:25.230 --> 39:27.764
Oh, my God.
This look is never gonna make it to work.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.200
Oh, come on, man.
This is new Mitch coming through.

39:30.202 --> 39:32.769
Oh, my... I can't believe how
many times you cut me.

39:32.771 --> 39:33.970
The lacerations will fade,

39:33.972 --> 39:36.106
but the memories will last us a lifetime.

39:36.108 --> 39:39.309
Oh, we can't say nothing
happened on this trip, huh?

39:39.311 --> 39:41.611
[sighs] God.

39:41.613 --> 39:42.879
Yeah.

39:48.619 --> 39:49.018
What?

39:52.656 --> 39:55.291
Have you ever been this thirsty?

39:56.627 --> 39:58.161
No.

40:04.635 --> 40:07.570
[sipping]

40:07.572 --> 40:09.672
Really?

40:09.674 --> 40:11.708
It tastes like water.

40:11.710 --> 40:12.709
Gimme.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.177
Yeah, tastes like water.

40:18.449 --> 40:19.249
[spits]

40:19.251 --> 40:20.750
It's blue and soapy.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.051
Yeah, well, it's washer fluid.

40:22.053 --> 40:23.553
What do you expect?

40:23.555 --> 40:25.021
[gags]

40:25.023 --> 40:27.257
That's horrible.

40:28.659 --> 40:30.126
I don't...

40:32.229 --> 40:34.497
I don't want any more.

40:36.901 --> 40:38.968
All right.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.137
I don't like it. Well...

40:41.139 --> 40:43.740
I... I'm gonna save mine for tomorrow,

40:43.742 --> 40:46.943
in case I have to go for a walk.

40:48.879 --> 40:51.948
Yeah, well, we should pro...

40:51.950 --> 40:54.684
We should probably get some sleep...

40:54.686 --> 40:57.220
- Yeah.
- in case you do, huh?

40:57.222 --> 40:59.322
Yeah.

40:59.324 --> 41:01.124
[snoring]

41:01.126 --> 41:03.326
[wind blowing]

41:11.735 --> 41:13.736
[vomits]

41:13.738 --> 41:15.738
[coughing, gagging]

41:23.881 --> 41:26.249
[vomits]

41:27.318 --> 41:29.319
[snoring]

41:54.478 --> 41:55.478
Holy shit.

41:55.480 --> 41:56.479
[horn honks]

41:56.481 --> 41:58.948
Hold on. Hello.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.583
Hello? Hi. Oh, God.

42:00.585 --> 42:02.752
Thank you. Wait.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.087
Hi. Hi.

42:04.089 --> 42:05.488
Hold on. Hi. Hi.

42:05.490 --> 42:07.724
How... How are you? It's so good to see you.

42:07.726 --> 42:09.158
We had... Ow.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.160
Okay, don't go anywhere.

42:11.162 --> 42:14.264
Um, we had a...

42:14.266 --> 42:16.699
problem last night.

42:16.701 --> 42:19.302
It's so good to see you. I'm sorry. Um,

42:19.304 --> 42:22.972
oh, my God.
We had a bit of an issue with the engine.

42:22.974 --> 42:25.041
- [vomits]
- I guess I tampered with it,

42:25.043 --> 42:26.643
or... I didn't really dismantle it.

42:26.645 --> 42:29.946
It's fine. It's all good, but, uh,

42:29.948 --> 42:31.581
God, we were here all night,

42:31.583 --> 42:33.483
all day and all night last night.

42:33.485 --> 42:35.585
Maybe you have food or water or something?

42:35.587 --> 42:37.186
Just... Just anything? A ride, you know?

42:37.188 --> 42:39.622
We... We'll...

42:39.624 --> 42:40.590
Wait! No!

42:40.592 --> 42:43.526
Where are you going? Wait! Wait! Wait!

42:49.500 --> 42:50.833
Oh, God.

42:50.835 --> 42:55.505
What the fuck are you doing?!

42:57.541 --> 43:00.577
I... I thought she was gonna take us with her.

43:00.579 --> 43:01.911
She was!

43:01.913 --> 43:04.681
Until you scared the shit out of her!

43:04.683 --> 43:07.884
You couldn't wait one minute
to get into the car, man?

43:07.886 --> 43:09.118
Come on!

43:09.120 --> 43:10.219
I don't... I don't know.

43:10.221 --> 43:12.288
I thought she... I thought that...

43:12.290 --> 43:16.893
You look like a goddamn
fucking horror movie extra!

43:16.895 --> 43:18.261
[sobs]

43:18.263 --> 43:20.730
Let's remember why I look like this.

43:20.732 --> 43:22.565
This... This was your idea!

43:22.567 --> 43:25.935
What am I afraid of?
What can it hurt? Well, there you go.

43:25.937 --> 43:29.639
That is exactly why you can't
have a Mohawk in the real world.

43:29.641 --> 43:33.343
I gave you a haircut, not a lobotomy.

43:35.012 --> 43:36.479
I don't feel well.

43:36.481 --> 43:37.513
Ahh.

43:37.515 --> 43:39.549
Maybe it has something to do with the fact

43:39.551 --> 43:42.418
that I spent a day in the oven
and the night in the freezer

43:42.420 --> 43:44.320
with nothing but fucking
washer fluid in my system!

43:44.322 --> 43:46.356
I told you not to drink that shit, man.

43:46.358 --> 43:47.390
Oh! It tasted like soap!

43:47.392 --> 43:49.058
Okay, so this is all my fault.

43:49.060 --> 43:51.527
I got us stuck in the desert.

43:51.529 --> 43:55.498
Well, you certainly got us
stuck for another 20 hours.

43:57.234 --> 43:58.968
Hey, do me a favor.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.537
If you see any more cars coming,

44:01.539 --> 44:05.341
try not to be such a fucking moron!

44:05.343 --> 44:06.843
This is exactly what happens

44:06.845 --> 44:09.779
when you let a homeless person cut your hair!

44:09.781 --> 44:13.216
[mocking laugh]

44:13.218 --> 44:15.385
[coughs]

44:15.387 --> 44:17.553
Don't worry. I'm gonna call Joanne for you.

44:17.555 --> 44:20.289
I'll tell her you're just fine, you'll be home soon,

44:20.291 --> 44:22.458
but you won't be able to get it up looking at

44:22.460 --> 44:23.726
- her fat fucking thighs...
- Hey!

44:23.728 --> 44:25.962
unless you think about your girlfriend Annie.

44:25.964 --> 44:27.697
Hey, you better keep your mouth shut!

44:27.699 --> 44:29.632
[coughs] Then maybe she'll give you

44:29.634 --> 44:32.235
that divorce you're so scared to ask for.

44:32.237 --> 44:37.407
Then you can give those keys you
love so much to Cole's new dad!

44:37.409 --> 44:38.408
Hey!

44:39.777 --> 44:41.678
You fucker.

44:44.648 --> 44:45.815
Aah!

44:45.817 --> 44:50.219
Oh, shit.

44:57.094 --> 44:58.261
Hey.

44:58.263 --> 44:59.862
You son of a bitch.

45:00.998 --> 45:02.198
Hey.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.233
- Come here.
- Hey!

45:04.235 --> 45:05.868
- Come here!
- Hey! Hey!

45:05.870 --> 45:07.236
[both grunting]

45:13.043 --> 45:14.243
You son of a...

45:15.813 --> 45:17.613
[groans, gasps]

45:17.615 --> 45:18.614
You...

45:19.817 --> 45:22.585
You just broke my nose!

45:22.587 --> 45:23.586
Fucking...

45:25.055 --> 45:26.456
Yaah!

45:27.257 --> 45:28.725
Damn it.

45:28.727 --> 45:30.760
Hyah!

45:30.762 --> 45:32.995
[yelling]

45:42.539 --> 45:44.440
Come on!

45:45.442 --> 45:48.077
Aah! Oh, my eye! Time-out!

45:48.079 --> 45:49.679
- Are you all right?
- [wailing]

45:49.681 --> 45:52.081
[yelling]

45:52.083 --> 45:54.417
- Damn it!
- [yelling]

45:59.323 --> 46:00.523
[yelling stops]

46:05.462 --> 46:07.263
[Mitch groaning]

46:10.067 --> 46:12.268
I think you broke my nose.

46:15.372 --> 46:17.874
Now I'm going to have two casts

46:17.876 --> 46:19.809
and a fucking Mohawk.

46:25.916 --> 46:27.884
[spits]

46:27.886 --> 46:30.620
Hey, quit fucking around, and get up.

46:33.290 --> 46:34.791
Come on. Get up!

46:36.660 --> 46:37.894
Carter.

46:40.063 --> 46:41.631
Carter?

46:47.704 --> 46:49.572
Hey.

46:49.574 --> 46:51.641
Hey.

46:51.643 --> 46:54.110
Get up!

46:54.112 --> 46:56.078
Get up!

46:56.080 --> 46:57.079
C...

46:57.081 --> 46:58.214
Hey.

46:58.216 --> 47:00.917
Hey! Come on.

47:00.919 --> 47:02.885
Come on.

47:02.887 --> 47:04.353
Carter.

47:06.256 --> 47:07.824
Oh, shit.

47:10.627 --> 47:11.928
Oh, man.

47:11.930 --> 47:13.663
I'm so sorry.

47:13.665 --> 47:16.999
Carter, come on, buddy. Wake up.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.601
Wake up.

47:18.603 --> 47:19.936
Wake up.

47:24.308 --> 47:26.909
Oh, my God.

47:26.911 --> 47:28.211
Oh, my God.

47:28.213 --> 47:30.179
Oh, my God.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.814
Oh, my God.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.085
Oh, my God.

47:40.224 --> 47:41.490
Carter, come on, buddy.

47:41.492 --> 47:43.326
Get up. Get up.

47:43.328 --> 47:44.927
Get up!

47:44.929 --> 47:46.529
Get up!

47:47.364 --> 47:49.832
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

47:52.035 --> 47:53.903
[sobbing] Oh, my God.

47:56.340 --> 47:58.774
H... Hey...

48:03.080 --> 48:04.714
Ah, fuck.

48:07.150 --> 48:08.751
What the...

48:33.143 --> 48:35.278
It's gonna be okay, buddy.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.746
It's gonna be okay.

48:37.648 --> 48:39.615
You know, I was thinking about it,

48:39.617 --> 48:40.983
and it's really funny.

48:42.686 --> 48:45.021
We should have thought about it sooner.

48:45.023 --> 48:45.888
[laughs]

48:45.890 --> 48:47.556
We scared that old lady, man.

48:47.558 --> 48:50.126
We scared her.
[laughing]

48:51.528 --> 48:53.062
I mean, look at me, right?

48:53.064 --> 48:55.665
I'd be scared of me. I'm... I look fucking crazy.

48:55.667 --> 48:57.700
But that's okay. That's good. That's very good,

48:57.702 --> 48:59.435
because she probably went straight to town

48:59.437 --> 49:00.703
and told somebody about it, right?

49:00.705 --> 49:02.405
She probably went to the first house

49:02.407 --> 49:04.307
or store or whatever

49:04.309 --> 49:06.842
and was like,
"Ohh, you gotta help me."

49:06.844 --> 49:09.078
"Some crazy guy with a crazy haircut

49:09.080 --> 49:10.713
tried to get in my car."

49:10.715 --> 49:13.082
But I wasn't trying to get in her car.

49:13.084 --> 49:15.217
I was just... I was just feeling it, you know.

49:15.219 --> 49:18.921
I was just trying to make sure it
wasn't one of those, what, mirages,

49:18.923 --> 49:21.090
like in the cartoons, you know?

49:24.728 --> 49:26.929
But that's okay. That's good.

49:26.931 --> 49:29.332
That's very good, because
she probably told somebody,

49:29.334 --> 49:32.535
and they're gonna come out here and check it out.

49:32.537 --> 49:34.136
They're probably sending somebody right now.

49:34.138 --> 49:35.438
They're probably...

49:35.440 --> 49:37.173
They're probably sending the police.

49:40.944 --> 49:43.412
The police are probably coming right now.

49:43.414 --> 49:46.082
[wind blowing]

49:46.084 --> 49:47.149
Carter.

49:49.052 --> 49:50.386
Carter, hey,

49:50.388 --> 49:52.388
I think the police are coming.

49:52.390 --> 49:55.324
Carter, I need you to wake up, buddy.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.326
I need you to wake up!

49:57.328 --> 49:58.728
Carter!

49:58.730 --> 50:00.696
The police are coming.

50:00.698 --> 50:02.631
The police are coming!

50:04.434 --> 50:07.370
I need you to help me make them
understand how this happened.

50:07.372 --> 50:09.271
Carter, come on!

50:09.273 --> 50:11.073
Come on!

50:11.075 --> 50:12.074
Hello!

50:12.076 --> 50:14.176
Do you hear me?

50:15.512 --> 50:17.780
'Cause if you don't help me explain,

50:17.782 --> 50:19.515
they're not gonna understand, Carter.

50:19.517 --> 50:20.850
Come on!

50:20.852 --> 50:22.885
Come on!

50:26.289 --> 50:27.556
You remember my keys?

50:27.558 --> 50:28.724
Do you remember my keys?

50:28.726 --> 50:30.726
I got a lot of things to worry about.

50:30.728 --> 50:33.062
Come on, buddy. Wake up.

50:33.064 --> 50:34.964
Wake up!

50:35.999 --> 50:38.000
[sobbing]

50:46.009 --> 50:48.077
Fucking... I am sorry.

50:53.250 --> 50:55.851
[grunting]

52:13.997 --> 52:16.031
[groans]

52:16.033 --> 52:17.500
Carter?

52:17.502 --> 52:19.435
- [coughs]
- Carter?

52:19.437 --> 52:20.503
Carter.

52:20.505 --> 52:21.804
Holy shit!

52:21.806 --> 52:23.172
Holy shit! You're alive!

52:23.174 --> 52:24.473
You're alive!

52:24.475 --> 52:26.442
Carter! Oh. Okay.

52:26.444 --> 52:27.510
J... Just wait here.

52:27.512 --> 52:28.878
Just... You're okay.

52:28.880 --> 52:30.713
You're okay. You're okay. You're okay.

52:30.715 --> 52:32.715
Everything's gonna be okay. All right?

52:32.717 --> 52:34.383
What's happening?

52:34.385 --> 52:35.451
What's happening?

52:35.453 --> 52:37.186
You scared the shit out of me!

52:37.188 --> 52:38.621
That's what's happening.
[laughs]

52:38.623 --> 52:39.622
Ow, my head.

52:39.624 --> 52:40.823
Ohh. Oh, my God. Quit it.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.358
I can't believe it.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.793
I have the worst headache
I've ever had in my life.

52:44.795 --> 52:45.828
Okay. All right, well, just...

52:45.830 --> 52:47.163
Just stay right there, okay?

52:47.165 --> 52:48.864
We'll get you taken care of.

52:49.799 --> 52:52.668
Oh shit. Oh, fuck.

52:52.670 --> 52:54.670
Um...

52:54.672 --> 52:56.205
is this all mine?

52:56.207 --> 52:58.240
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.

52:58.242 --> 52:59.408
Ohh.

53:01.444 --> 53:02.945
Jesus.

53:02.947 --> 53:04.380
What the fuck happened to you, man?

53:04.382 --> 53:06.282
You.

53:06.284 --> 53:08.017
Wow.

53:08.019 --> 53:09.418
[chuckles]

53:09.420 --> 53:10.886
[coughs]

53:10.888 --> 53:12.521
Okay, just... Keep breathing.

53:12.523 --> 53:13.789
- Breathe in.
- [deep breathing]

53:13.791 --> 53:15.758
Breathe in. Breathe in.

53:15.760 --> 53:17.459
- Okay.
- There you go.

53:17.461 --> 53:19.261
All right. Good job. Good job.

53:19.263 --> 53:21.797
I hope I don't look as bad as you do.

53:21.799 --> 53:23.632
Let's just say we're tied.

53:23.634 --> 53:25.367
Let's just...

53:27.437 --> 53:29.705
Um...

53:29.707 --> 53:32.308
what the fuck happened to my hand?

53:32.310 --> 53:33.409
Oh.

53:33.411 --> 53:35.211
Uh, it...

53:35.213 --> 53:36.912
looks broken.

53:36.914 --> 53:38.647
Yeah. It looks really broken.

53:38.649 --> 53:39.648
Yeah.

53:39.650 --> 53:40.916
[groans]

53:40.918 --> 53:42.251
Look, I'm just...

53:43.653 --> 53:45.120
Look, it d... It doesn't matter, okay?

53:45.122 --> 53:46.956
I'm just happy that you're alive and okay.

53:46.958 --> 53:49.525
W... What the fuck happened here?

53:49.527 --> 53:51.660
W... We were arguing.

53:51.662 --> 53:52.795
You don't remember?

53:52.797 --> 53:53.929
[groans] No.

53:53.931 --> 53:55.831
It really hurts to think, actually.

53:55.833 --> 53:58.100
Well, then don't. Just... Just sit here. Rest.

53:58.102 --> 54:00.102
It doesn't matter anyway. It's over.

54:00.104 --> 54:01.003
[gasping]

54:01.005 --> 54:03.138
Oh, my God. It's almost dark.

54:03.140 --> 54:03.939
Yeah.

54:03.941 --> 54:06.242
And nobody's come?

54:06.244 --> 54:09.144
No. I hoped that lady was
going to send somebody,

54:09.146 --> 54:09.945
but she, uh...

54:09.947 --> 54:12.181
[groans, laughs]

54:12.183 --> 54:14.783
Just take it easy. I... I'll keep lookout.

54:14.785 --> 54:17.486
Oh, watch out.

54:17.488 --> 54:18.654
Oh, God.

54:18.656 --> 54:19.755
Maybe I just need to...

54:19.757 --> 54:21.156
No, no. You stay. Just stay...

54:21.158 --> 54:24.026
I just need to sit up for a second.

54:27.897 --> 54:29.765
What the hell is that?

54:31.501 --> 54:32.501
Uh...

54:32.503 --> 54:33.502
Well, it...

54:33.504 --> 54:34.870
What the fuck is that?!

54:34.872 --> 54:36.705
You don't understand. I thought you were...

54:36.707 --> 54:38.474
What the fuck is that?! Listen. Listen.

54:38.476 --> 54:39.508
Stay back! Listen.

54:39.510 --> 54:40.743
Get away from me!

54:40.745 --> 54:42.911
Come on, Carter. I thought you were dead.

54:42.913 --> 54:44.280
I thought you were...

54:44.282 --> 54:45.114
Stay back!

54:45.116 --> 54:47.116
I... I didn't feel a pulse.

54:47.118 --> 54:48.984
I checked your... and there was no pulse.

54:48.986 --> 54:50.552
I didn't know what to do.

54:52.122 --> 54:54.490
So you were just gonna
fucking bury me in a hole?!

54:54.492 --> 54:56.025
No, no. It's not like that. Listen.

54:56.027 --> 54:57.426
Are you fucking crazy?!

54:57.428 --> 54:59.828
We were fighting, and you pulled the knife on me!

54:59.830 --> 55:00.963
You broke my fucking nose!

55:00.965 --> 55:02.398
You get the fuck back!

55:02.400 --> 55:03.499
You bit my fucking cast!

55:03.501 --> 55:06.635
What was I supposed to do? Come on. Just...

55:06.637 --> 55:08.504
You tried to fucking kill me!

55:08.506 --> 55:11.240
I wasn't trying to kill you, buddy. Just...

01:15:15.111 --> 01:15:16.310
This is it.

01:15:16.312 --> 01:15:17.311
All right.

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:28.022
[soundtrack music playing]

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:15.169
[music continues playing]

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:11.792
All right, buddy, let's go.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:13.527
[grunts]

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:16.631
There you go.

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:17.698
You ready?

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:21.869
Are you sure you're okay with this?

01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:23.871
Are you kidding me, man? It's the least I can do.

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:27.408
Besides, it'll give me a chance
to knock out a big chunk.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:28.209
Yeah.

01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:30.378
I'm proud of you, man.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.647
Well, it's just flowing from me now.

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:33.547
[laughs]

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:35.249
How long is it gonna take you guys

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:36.250
to circumnavigate the world?

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:37.785
Uh, you know,

01:17:37.787 --> 01:17:40.021
we're gonna stay with the
parents for a couple days,

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:42.690
and I'm still not entirely sure
we're gonna get through that,

01:17:42.692 --> 01:17:44.725
but if we do, the tickets are open-ended,

01:17:44.727 --> 01:17:47.628
so we'll just pick a continent
and stay until we get bored

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:49.597
or, you know, run out of money.

01:17:50.732 --> 01:17:52.800
You know, she's... she's not...

01:17:52.802 --> 01:17:54.535
what I thought, you know?

01:17:54.537 --> 01:17:56.303
I mean...

01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:57.605
I never really knew.

01:17:57.607 --> 01:18:00.474
Yeah, well, she said the same thing about you.

01:18:00.476 --> 01:18:02.843
Yeah.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:04.578
All right, come here, you.

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:07.048
- All right, man.
- See you.

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:08.082
- Be good.
- All right.

01:18:08.084 --> 01:18:09.917
- Be safe.
- All right.

01:18:09.919 --> 01:18:11.719
All right.

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:26.233
[gasping]

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:01.736
[line rings]

01:19:01.738 --> 01:19:03.370
[ring]

01:19:03.372 --> 01:19:04.705
CARTER: Hello.

01:19:04.707 --> 01:19:06.107
Hey.

01:19:06.109 --> 01:19:07.641
I wake you?

01:19:07.643 --> 01:19:10.144
No, I just... I'm finishing some stuff up.

01:19:10.146 --> 01:19:11.812
What's going on?

01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:14.448
Eh, you know,

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:16.917
I just wanted someone to talk to.

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:18.986
I'm feeling...

01:19:18.988 --> 01:19:20.488
weird.

01:19:20.490 --> 01:19:23.824
Has it occurred to you that
maybe you need some sleep?

01:19:23.826 --> 01:19:25.426
[sighs] I guess...

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.862
I thought that I was past the point

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:31.031
where I really believed that people could change,
you know?

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:34.368
At least, the point where I thought that I could.

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.804
Sounds like a pleasant surprise, no?

01:19:36.806 --> 01:19:38.305
Yeah. Absolutely,

01:19:38.307 --> 01:19:41.041
but I'm just not sure I believe it.

01:19:41.043 --> 01:19:42.443
Believe what?

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:44.478
That I'm really doing this.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.581
Well, what exactly is the alternative?

01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:49.550
Well, this is gonna sound a little crazy.

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:52.286
Imagine that.
You called me in the middle of the night

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:53.988
with something that sounds a little crazy?

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:55.890
Part of me believes that...

01:19:57.526 --> 01:20:00.361
we never made it out of that desert...

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:04.832
that we're just lying there, overcome...

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:09.703
and this is just all part of our imagination.

01:20:09.705 --> 01:20:12.706
I told you this was gonna sound crazy, but...

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:15.609
And you didn't sell it short.

01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:18.879
A... Are you telling me that
you're not at all suspicious

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:21.482
that things have gone so smoothly?

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:23.117
Suspicious? No.

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:25.419
I'm stunned, I'm impressed,

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:27.388
but I'm not suspicious.

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:29.423
Well, maybe you should be.

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:30.825
I mean, think about it.

01:20:30.827 --> 01:20:33.527
Things may be just a little too good to be true,

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:34.728
you know what I mean?

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:36.964
Believe me, if I was making this up,

01:20:36.966 --> 01:20:39.700
there'd be a lot more lottery
winning and supermodeling.

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:42.436
Well, at least convince me that it's probable,

01:20:42.438 --> 01:20:43.804
you know, that life really

01:20:43.806 --> 01:20:46.440
can turn on a dime, that you really can...

01:20:46.442 --> 01:20:47.741
I don't know... reinvent yourself.

01:20:47.743 --> 01:20:49.410
Which is harder to believe,

01:20:49.412 --> 01:20:52.680
that things are finally going the
way you always wanted them to

01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:54.715
or that the only way it could be this good

01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:56.283
is if it's all in your head?

01:20:56.285 --> 01:20:57.451
I don't know.

01:20:57.453 --> 01:20:59.119
You don't have an opinion on that?

01:20:59.121 --> 01:21:00.688
Well, I don't know about you,

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:02.289
but this better be reality for me,

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:04.158
because if we're still out in the middle

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.426
of the desert somewhere,

01:21:05.428 --> 01:21:07.494
I just finished an imaginary book.

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:11.298
Wow, that's... That's really, really fast.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:13.767
So tell me how it ends.

01:21:13.769 --> 01:21:16.070
Well, that's the funny thi...

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:18.239
[static clicks]

01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:19.974

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:22.509
Carter?

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:28.616
Piece of shit.
