00:32.269 --> 00:35.928
I had made
Nonnatus House my home.

00:35.940 --> 00:38.779
When I needed peace and comfort,

00:38.780 --> 00:42.099
when I needed to grieve
and to be restored,

00:42.100 --> 00:44.539
I did not go far.

00:44.540 --> 00:48.819
It was as though its roof
still sheltered me,

00:48.820 --> 00:52.579
as though I was still safe
within its walls.

00:52.580 --> 00:55.659
Sister Julienne,
has the post gone yet?

00:55.660 --> 00:57.379
No. You're in luck.

00:57.380 --> 00:59.219
Oh, good.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.739
I don't wear this any more.
I thought it could go to

01:01.740 --> 01:03.779
the Girls' Brigade donation
for the home.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.019
Oh, thank you!

01:05.019 --> 01:07.379
Is there anything you want
to send to Nurse Lee?

01:07.380 --> 01:08.499
Just this letter.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.139
I sat up all night trying to think
of something cheerful to say

01:11.140 --> 01:12.779
that didn't sound too callous.

01:12.780 --> 01:14.540
It's a frightfully fine line.

01:17.740 --> 01:20.579
You may take these
to the Post Office

01:20.580 --> 01:22.419
but come straight back.

01:22.420 --> 01:24.299
We've a great deal to do
this morning.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.540
Of course, Sister.

01:42.580 --> 01:45.099
People retreat from the world

01:45.100 --> 01:46.859
for different reasons.

01:46.860 --> 01:51.579
But if I had come to the
Mother House of the order to forget,

01:51.580 --> 01:54.180
I was not forgotten.

01:57.020 --> 01:59.459
And that I was remembered

01:59.460 --> 02:01.900
made my pain endurable.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.299
Lovely!

02:17.300 --> 02:19.659
I knew that nice little
Girls' Brigade leader

02:19.660 --> 02:21.099
wouldn't let us down.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.739
The Postman nearly did.

02:23.740 --> 02:25.219
Late again.

02:25.220 --> 02:28.459
I ought to send you out
to the gate to meet him.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.699
There's nothing like one of
your reproachful stares

02:30.700 --> 02:32.699
to make a person toe the line.

02:32.700 --> 02:36.380
He's scared I'll hit him
with my stick.

02:38.940 --> 02:40.180
Right, Jacob...

02:41.380 --> 02:44.540
..are you ready for a spot of
crowd control after lunch?

02:46.460 --> 02:47.939
What is this?

02:47.940 --> 02:50.900
It's called Quiche Lorraine,
according to Mrs B.

02:52.660 --> 02:53.739
Pass me the beetroot.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.619
With Sister Julienne's permission,
I'll make myself a sandwich.

02:56.620 --> 02:57.979
Of course.

02:57.980 --> 02:59.699
What I want to know is

02:59.700 --> 03:02.579
does Nurse Lee say
when she's coming back?

03:02.580 --> 03:04.459
No, she doesn't.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.219
She just closes by saying,

03:06.220 --> 03:09.339
"I hope Sister Monica Joan
enjoyed the cake as much as I did!

03:09.340 --> 03:10.859
"Love, Jenny."

03:10.860 --> 03:12.379
And three kisses.

03:12.380 --> 03:15.219
So glad she chose
to go to the Mother House.

03:15.220 --> 03:17.899
It seems like the perfect place
for her to recuperate.

03:17.900 --> 03:21.459
Much as we all feel
deep compassion for Nurse Lee,

03:21.460 --> 03:24.500
her absence is felt
across every department.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.459
I think she's fainted!

03:31.460 --> 03:33.060
Sister? Sister?

03:37.260 --> 03:39.019
Steak and kidney pie.

03:39.020 --> 03:40.499
Your steak and kidney pie?

03:40.500 --> 03:43.059
Timothy helped a bit this time.

03:43.060 --> 03:45.299
I think I might have
a rival on my hands!

03:45.300 --> 03:47.179
I only rolled some of the pastry.

03:47.180 --> 03:48.859
Well, it looks delicious.

03:48.860 --> 03:50.379
You keep him at it.

03:50.380 --> 03:51.979
It's the summer holiday!

03:51.980 --> 03:54.099
I don't want to be inside
doing cookery.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.779
I want to play out!

03:55.780 --> 03:57.739
You can't play out, Timothy.

03:57.740 --> 04:00.139
You can't keep up
with the other boys just now.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.979
They'll slow down for me.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.900
I don't want you getting hurt.

04:06.860 --> 04:09.019
I thought we'd get
the bus into town one day

04:09.020 --> 04:10.779
and go to the Science Museum.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.820
Oh, I can't wait!

04:18.180 --> 04:19.579
Behave yourself, Tim.

04:20.779 --> 04:23.659
I don't get the chance
to do anything else.

04:23.660 --> 04:26.220
Polio damaged my legs, not my brain.

04:28.460 --> 04:32.059
Patrick, you're needed
at Nonnatus House.

04:32.060 --> 04:34.660
It's Sister Julienne.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.299
Stay there.

04:40.300 --> 04:43.740
We can hunt down an ice cream van
later, when I'm on my rounds.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.859
Very well, everyone!

05:07.860 --> 05:09.899
All the party clothes

05:09.900 --> 05:13.179
are laid out on the trestle tables.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.819
and you are all to choose one outfit

05:15.820 --> 05:18.379
to wear for the Founder's Day dance.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.899
Do you all understand?

05:19.900 --> 05:22.899
Yes, Miss Molyneux.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.020
In you go!

05:35.460 --> 05:38.179
It's mine, Mavis! It's mine! Let go!

05:38.180 --> 05:39.939
It won't even fit you!

05:39.940 --> 05:43.419
Mavis, give it back to Sally. Why?

05:43.420 --> 05:45.660
Because she's older than you.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.539
Now, Sally,

05:49.540 --> 05:52.900
find something pretty for Mavis.

05:56.860 --> 05:58.619
That's nice, I like that one.

05:58.620 --> 06:01.419
We'll arrange some bloods
to be on the safe side.

06:01.420 --> 06:03.619
But I can't find
anything wrong with you

06:03.620 --> 06:04.899
a proper rest won't cure.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.859
I wouldn't say no to a day in bed

06:06.860 --> 06:08.219
and that's not like me.

06:08.220 --> 06:09.419
No, it isn't.

06:09.420 --> 06:10.819
But I'm not talking a day.

06:10.820 --> 06:13.979
I'm talking a week at least
and preferably two.

06:13.980 --> 06:16.459
I am prescribing you a fortnight
at the Mother House,

06:16.460 --> 06:17.779
starting tomorrow.

06:17.780 --> 06:19.939
It's out of the question.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.499
We're a midwife short

06:21.500 --> 06:24.219
and I've Sister Evangelina's jubilee
to organise.

06:24.220 --> 06:25.619
Jubilee?

06:25.620 --> 06:28.179
It's the anniversary
of her religious vows

06:28.180 --> 06:30.459
and I need to arrange a service
and a party...

06:30.460 --> 06:32.259
Some of that's already under way!

06:32.260 --> 06:34.859
I've been writing letters
to try to track down her family

06:34.860 --> 06:36.259
and invite them. There!

06:36.260 --> 06:38.419
Sister Winifred
can organise the jubilee

06:38.420 --> 06:40.259
and someone else can run the office.

06:40.260 --> 06:42.140
No-one else is capable. I...

06:45.580 --> 06:46.620
Catch it!

06:54.420 --> 06:57.499
Throw it to me!

06:57.500 --> 06:59.980
Colin Cowdrey eat your heart out.
Eh, Doc?

07:01.420 --> 07:02.900
Absolutely.

07:04.180 --> 07:05.740
Good shot, Tim!

07:09.620 --> 07:13.299
I can't believe you left him there!
What if he falls over?

07:13.300 --> 07:16.059
Or wears himself out
and is too tired to walk home?

07:16.060 --> 07:18.539
Shelagh, leave him
to his own devices.

07:18.540 --> 07:21.099
We both left him to his own devices,
if you remember,

07:21.100 --> 07:23.059
the day he was taken ill!

07:23.060 --> 07:25.659
I don't deserve that
and neither do you.

07:25.660 --> 07:27.179
I'm sorry.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.699
I'm sorry! We're both sorry.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.100
And he's an 11-year-old boy.

07:33.140 --> 07:36.140
Polio or no polio,
he needs to spread his wings.

07:37.740 --> 07:40.300
I don't know what
I'm going to do with myself.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.899
I do.

07:44.900 --> 07:47.019
We still have to find
another midwife

07:47.020 --> 07:49.019
as soon as is humanly possible.

07:49.020 --> 07:51.419
The current casebook
makes for terrifying reading.

07:51.420 --> 07:54.059
I took the liberty
of speaking to Nurse Noakes

07:54.060 --> 07:57.339
and she's already agreed
to do some extra shifts.

07:57.340 --> 07:58.380
May I?

08:01.300 --> 08:05.019
I should really let you see it from
this side of the desk, shouldn't I?

08:05.020 --> 08:08.499
If I'm to take over the
administration whilst you are away,

08:08.500 --> 08:09.820
that would be best.

08:21.740 --> 08:24.859
Did Dr Turner tell you
that the gait assessment clinic

08:24.860 --> 08:27.099
is going to be moved
to the Community Centre?

08:27.100 --> 08:30.379
Sister Julienne, I think
we're making each other nervous.

08:30.380 --> 08:33.860
That wasn't the object
of this exercise. No.

08:38.419 --> 08:40.659
You can't go out in a sopping wet
uniform, Camilla!

08:40.659 --> 08:42.938
I'm ironing it dry!
Look, dry as a bone.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.499
People will think you've had
the accident, not Freddie.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.059
They're expecting me at
Nonnatus House at half past, Peter!

08:48.060 --> 08:50.740
And I was expecting to be
in my bed at quarter to!

08:52.660 --> 08:57.179
I'm the most inconsiderate beast in
the whole sorry history of creation.

08:57.180 --> 08:59.099
No, you're not.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.939
You received a call to arms,

09:00.940 --> 09:03.940
I understand.

09:17.860 --> 09:21.099
And may you enjoy every happiness
in your new home, Reverend.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.339
Thanks for your help, Fred.

09:22.340 --> 09:24.379
Don't go fretting
about your khazi,

09:24.380 --> 09:28.100
I'll be round tonight
to take me plunger to the U-bend.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.379
Never mind
helping the curate to move in!

09:34.380 --> 09:37.019
Sister Julienne's
got a train to catch! All right.

09:37.020 --> 09:38.300
Morning!

09:40.300 --> 09:43.460
He'd be more efficient
helping you to Mars!

09:48.340 --> 09:51.339
I think a jubilee
sounds tremendously jolly.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.179
Will we be having parlour games?

09:53.180 --> 09:55.499
Well, I did think I might try
and find a roulette wheel

09:55.500 --> 09:57.379
and set up a little casino
in the parlour!

09:57.380 --> 09:59.699
I've always fancied myself
as a croupier.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.059
The plan is for Holy Communion
followed by a tea party.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.139
It's custom to invite
the sister's family,

10:05.140 --> 10:07.219
and any friends
she has outside the order.

10:07.220 --> 10:09.699
I think she had quite
a few brothers and sisters,

10:09.700 --> 10:11.179
I've heard her mention it.

10:11.180 --> 10:13.339
I have written to
her last known address

10:13.340 --> 10:15.019
before she entered as a postulant

10:15.020 --> 10:16.859
but there's been no response.

10:16.860 --> 10:19.299
Have you tried writing
to the curate of that parish?

10:19.300 --> 10:22.659
Curates are always such founts
of vital information.

10:22.660 --> 10:25.499
Right, ladies, stand and deliver.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.579
Lisbon Buildings beckons, as usual.

10:28.580 --> 10:30.380
Who's going to answer the call?

10:34.060 --> 10:37.179
Faggots and peas,
I can't say I'm not relieved.

10:37.180 --> 10:40.659
So, Mrs Turner,
have you had a busy morning?

10:40.660 --> 10:42.099
Yes, I have!

10:42.100 --> 10:43.859
I've engaged a new midwife,

10:43.860 --> 10:46.699
who will be joining us from
The London the day after tomorrow.

10:46.700 --> 10:49.179
She'll be staying on
after Nurse Lee returns.

10:49.180 --> 10:51.020
That's wonderful news!

10:53.140 --> 10:55.059
Oh, I'm frightfully sorry

10:55.060 --> 10:57.379
but I don't think I can eat
a morsel of lunch

10:57.380 --> 11:00.859
until we've found out which
one of us has walked in dog dirt.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.139
How do you know it isn't you?

11:02.140 --> 11:04.419
It was you last time,
with your winklepicker shoes.

11:04.420 --> 11:06.500
The mat in the parlour
still hasn't recovered.

11:08.860 --> 11:09.979
Innocent.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.860
Sister Winifred, Nurse Miller?

11:13.100 --> 11:14.539
Mrs Turner?

11:14.540 --> 11:18.699
And it was not I.
My olfactory powers are exceptional.

11:18.700 --> 11:22.699
I should have been immediately aware
of the offence

11:22.700 --> 11:24.260
and seen it remedied.

11:29.980 --> 11:34.060
For two pins, I'd have every mutt
in Poplar put down!

11:44.980 --> 11:47.539
Stand back, there's all kinds
spraying everywhere!

11:47.540 --> 11:50.339
Leave them to dry
and come back and eat your lunch.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.099
In my stockinged feet?
I don't think so.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.779
Is this your only pair of shoes?

11:55.780 --> 11:58.259
Dog dirt's the least
of your worries.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.699
The upper's completely
come away from the sole!

12:00.700 --> 12:04.140
You may recollect that some of us
have taken a vow of poverty.

12:06.780 --> 12:10.140
I've had these ten years -
get another couple out of them.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.339
I'm sending them to the menders.

12:13.340 --> 12:15.579
I'm sure you'll find something
to tide you over

12:15.580 --> 12:17.460
in the second-hand clothes box.

13:28.460 --> 13:31.139
Want to join in the dancing, Sheryl?

13:31.140 --> 13:33.499
I can manage by myself.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.099
Shy?

13:35.100 --> 13:37.019
She's one of my quiet ones.

13:37.020 --> 13:38.740
I wouldn't mind a few of those.

13:40.980 --> 13:43.899
Can you put on a slow one next,
Jacob,

13:43.900 --> 13:45.539
just to calm everybody down?

13:51.140 --> 13:52.180
That's the one.

14:00.180 --> 14:01.620
Ooh, I like this one.

14:38.300 --> 14:41.060
I feel sorry for them... all of them.

14:43.220 --> 14:45.339
Do you know something, Sheryl?

14:45.340 --> 14:46.779
I don't.

14:56.740 --> 14:58.819
Where you going?

14:58.820 --> 15:01.579
Where have you been? I've got to
pick up a list of my house calls.

15:01.580 --> 15:04.219
I was at weekly briefing.
What's the matter with Freddie?

15:04.220 --> 15:07.179
Eggs and soldiers
turned into a full-scale war.

15:07.180 --> 15:10.139
Mrs Torpy's gone to sit with him
until you come home!

15:10.140 --> 15:14.099
Oh, Mrs Torpy! There's a box
of Bickiepegs on the sideboard!

15:14.100 --> 15:15.179
Sorry.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.499
We agreed you'd work part-time,
Camilla.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.459
The trouble is, Peter,
I'm a midwife

15:20.460 --> 15:23.100
and babies aren't exactly
a part-time business.

15:25.660 --> 15:26.860
No, they aren't.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.260
Mrs Torpy?

15:46.900 --> 15:47.940
I say!

15:49.380 --> 15:51.060
I believe I'm expected?

15:56.140 --> 15:59.139
Any objection to me barging in?

15:59.140 --> 16:00.739
None...

16:00.740 --> 16:04.419
for we are besieged by duty
and obligation.

16:04.420 --> 16:07.739
All who enter here must serve,
as I do.

16:07.740 --> 16:10.859
"Golden lads and girls all must,

16:10.860 --> 16:15.019
"as chimney-sweepers, come to dust!"

16:15.020 --> 16:17.299
You need a spot of polish
on that cloth,

16:17.300 --> 16:18.980
preferably beeswax based.

16:23.540 --> 16:26.219
If I don't get a cup of coffee
within 60 seconds,

16:26.220 --> 16:27.939
I might commit murder.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.659
The only way
you're going to get that

16:29.660 --> 16:31.099
is if I pour it down your throat

16:31.100 --> 16:33.179
through a funnel,
while you're working.

16:33.180 --> 16:36.379
I want that autoclave turned round,
pronto.

16:36.380 --> 16:39.179
Unless you can levitate, I suggest
you all march in on tiptoes!

16:39.180 --> 16:40.579
I've done the whole thing twice,

16:40.580 --> 16:42.739
cos I thought I caught
a little whiff of dog mess.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.099
Are you the new girl?

16:44.100 --> 16:47.339
I'm Patience Mount
but people call me Patsy.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.459
Move your mop and bucket.

16:48.460 --> 16:51.059
Nurse Miller and Nurse Franklin
need to get to the autoclave.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.459
Oh, it's all been turned around.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.979
Two batches of instruments
all bagged up and ready to go.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.539
And I replenished the
dressing cupboard from the store.

16:57.540 --> 16:59.259
Really? Goodness.

16:59.260 --> 17:02.219
I think I might just have fallen
a little bit in love with you.

17:02.220 --> 17:05.378
Red hats are only correct
out of doors.

17:05.380 --> 17:08.459
I wanted to make sure it stayed on
during vigorous activity.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.420
There's nothing more unsettling
than an unkempt nurse.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.099
I think it's time
to put the kettle on.

17:23.099 --> 17:26.179
It's all very well,
cycling for 15 miles a day

17:26.180 --> 17:29.139
but that doesn't necessarily
do a huge amount for the waistline.

17:29.140 --> 17:32.059
And I'm thinking about going over
to an elastic panty girdle,

17:32.060 --> 17:33.619
so I need to get trim.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.099
Have you ever thought of fencing?
I fenced at school

17:36.100 --> 17:39.299
and I was the only girl
ever to beat Mother Gertrude.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.139
Did you go to a convent, Patsy?

17:41.140 --> 17:45.019
Yes, and I vowed I'd never go within
100 yards of another nun again.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.459
They were Catholics, though.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.859
I thought these
might be more humane.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.739
I've never met a Catholic nun

17:50.740 --> 17:53.219
but these are wonderful.

17:53.220 --> 17:56.419
They've been so kind to Jenny
since her boyfriend died.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.419
It's all horribly sad.

17:58.420 --> 18:01.059
I met her last year
when she was seconded to The London.

18:01.060 --> 18:03.659
It was actually her
who put midwifery in my mind.

18:03.660 --> 18:06.179
Male Surgical
was eroding my will to live.

18:06.180 --> 18:07.860
Or at least my will to nurse!

18:19.660 --> 18:21.539
More Scotch, anyone?

18:21.540 --> 18:24.580
Can I have quite a lot
of Canada Dry this time?

18:26.620 --> 18:29.019
I can't believe
you've brought your own whisky.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.259
Well, my father always says,

18:30.260 --> 18:31.859
"One should never start
a new venture

18:31.860 --> 18:33.819
"without a bottle
of something sociable."

18:33.820 --> 18:35.140
A man after my own heart.

18:37.660 --> 18:39.780
Cynthia, grab a hoop!

18:47.900 --> 18:49.300
Cynthia!

19:29.300 --> 19:33.459
I've come to see Sally, Jacob,
but she wasn't waiting on the steps!

19:33.460 --> 19:35.060
Miss Molyneux!

19:36.780 --> 19:39.099
Oh, yes, Mrs Harper!

19:39.100 --> 19:41.259
Sally's a bit
under the weather today.

19:41.260 --> 19:44.219
Peverell Ward -
left and up the back staircase.

19:44.220 --> 19:46.499
Never used to be allowed
to go up the stairs.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.940
Times change, Mrs Harper.
We're relaxing some of the rules.

19:54.220 --> 19:55.659
It's no good giving in to it.

19:55.660 --> 19:58.779
You just want to get up
and get your circulation moving.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.419
I'm not well, mum.

20:00.420 --> 20:02.179
Oh, Sally.

20:02.180 --> 20:06.019
You're going to have to show me
were it hurts. Come on.

20:06.020 --> 20:07.060
Oh, no.

20:09.220 --> 20:10.699
What's the matter?

20:10.700 --> 20:12.339
I don't know

20:12.340 --> 20:14.259
but I know it's not your monthlies.

20:14.260 --> 20:16.020
I don't have them any more.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.659
No!

20:19.660 --> 20:22.019
No, no!

20:22.020 --> 20:24.499
Mrs Harper, whatever is amiss?!

20:24.500 --> 20:26.859
I'm getting her on the first
and fastest bus out of here.

20:26.860 --> 20:29.499
I'm taking her home.
This IS my home!

20:29.500 --> 20:31.739
Come into my office
and sit down, both of you.

20:31.740 --> 20:34.259
We generally find Sally's
quite amenable to reason.

20:34.260 --> 20:36.459
What else has she been amenable to?

20:36.460 --> 20:38.100
That's what I'd like to know!

20:57.540 --> 21:00.459
Oh, Lord! Is that lemon meringue pie?

21:00.460 --> 21:03.179
Oh, sorry, old thing.
It's spoken for.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.300
It's been promised
as a raffle prize.

21:06.860 --> 21:10.019
Can we turn our minds
to the jubilee buffet?

21:10.020 --> 21:14.019
We're going to have vol-au-vents,
and cheese and pineapple sticks...

21:14.020 --> 21:15.779
Are you sure, Trixie?

21:15.780 --> 21:18.259
Sister Evangelina's
got quite a conservative palate.

21:18.260 --> 21:21.419
..and butterfly cakes
and a sherry trifle.

21:21.420 --> 21:24.699
Ooh, and I've found a recipe
for the most marvellous centrepiece.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.059
Do look.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.339
It's called a Banana Coronet.

21:28.340 --> 21:29.979
It looks a bit like Stonehenge,

21:29.980 --> 21:31.260
only made of penises.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.299
Sorry!

21:34.300 --> 21:37.459
Three years on Male Surgical
have rather made their mark.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.459
Clearly.

21:39.460 --> 21:42.859
So, any joy from the curate
of that parish?

21:42.860 --> 21:45.819
There's news
but it isn't very joyful.

21:45.820 --> 21:48.899
He wrote today, saying that
Sister Evangelina's eldest brother

21:48.900 --> 21:51.379
was killed on active service
in the war.

21:51.380 --> 21:54.499
The only ray of hope
seems to be Vincent, the youngest.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.219
He joined the Merchant Navy

21:56.220 --> 21:59.379
and the curate sent our letter
on to the Seaman's Mission.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.100
I'll go.

22:07.260 --> 22:10.619
May I help you? The name's Harper,
I'd like my daughter examined.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.019
I reckon she's in the family way.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.619
Surely not?

22:14.620 --> 22:16.299
It's Sally, isn't it?

22:16.300 --> 22:18.780
Don't you live at St Gideon's?
Not any more.

22:20.180 --> 22:21.300
Come in.

22:24.700 --> 22:27.179
Perhaps it's an abdominal tumour?

22:27.180 --> 22:28.779
Or trapped wind?

22:28.780 --> 22:31.539
I mean, is it even possible?

22:31.540 --> 22:33.940
I've never heard of it happening...
ever.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.299
Your hands are cold.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.339
Sorry, old thing,

22:40.340 --> 22:41.860
I should have warmed them.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.340
I think she's six and a half months.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.339
People said she'd be
better off in St Gideon's.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.419
I never wanted to send her away
but they said,

23:07.420 --> 23:10.539
"You can't be watching her
all the hours God sends!

23:10.540 --> 23:14.300
"She'll grow up, she'll develop
and the streets aren't safe."

23:15.380 --> 23:17.259
She smiles at people, Nurse.

23:17.260 --> 23:19.459
She thinks everyone's her friend.

23:19.460 --> 23:20.899
I can imagine.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.299
She seems so enormously trusting.

23:23.300 --> 23:26.779
Well, when she was 11,
she started wandering off.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.779
I never knew where she'd been,
or who with.

23:29.780 --> 23:31.339
So I did what people do...

23:31.340 --> 23:34.179
..I put her where she'd be safe.

23:34.180 --> 23:37.619
Doctor's prescribed Sally
some antibiotics.

23:37.620 --> 23:40.059
She'll soon be feeling
more comfortable.

23:40.060 --> 23:42.619
I don't know what disturbs me most,

23:42.620 --> 23:46.299
the pregnancy of an unmarried
30-year-old with mongolism

23:46.300 --> 23:50.539
or the untreated urine infection
that's left her in agonising pain.

23:50.540 --> 23:52.459
I think you'll find
the term mongolism

23:52.460 --> 23:54.379
is falling out of favour, Doctor.

23:54.380 --> 23:58.019
We prefer to say
Down's Syndrome, nowadays.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.739
In which case, I stand corrected.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.619
But it makes no material difference
to her plight

24:03.620 --> 24:05.299
or your negligence.

24:05.300 --> 24:08.259
She's been molested while
under your care and supervision.

24:08.260 --> 24:11.740
And I want every male resident,
nurse and orderly questioned.

24:13.260 --> 24:17.539
Has Sally made any disclosure
of how it all came about?

24:17.540 --> 24:18.699
No.

24:18.700 --> 24:21.899
But I think it's in everybody's
best interests to find out.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.900
Don't you?

24:26.860 --> 24:30.299
Whoever he is, he'll go down for it
if we catch him.

24:30.300 --> 24:31.739
According to the '56 Act,

24:31.740 --> 24:34.859
it's an offence to have intercourse
with a mental defective.

24:34.860 --> 24:36.899
Peter, that sounds so unfeeling!

24:36.900 --> 24:39.100
The man who did it
is the unfeeling one.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.619
You eat your pie and mash.

24:43.620 --> 24:45.259
There's a choc ice for your pudding

24:45.260 --> 24:47.659
and it's not every day
I make a grand romantic gesture.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.099
No.

24:49.100 --> 24:51.099
Although you rather
let the side down

24:51.100 --> 24:53.700
by not hiring a waiter
who can play the violin!

24:59.700 --> 25:02.219
I've got a day off tomorrow.

25:02.220 --> 25:03.939
I thought we could snuggle up
on the sofa

25:03.940 --> 25:05.699
and listen to Take It From Here.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.459
Oh, Peter, once we've cleared
this away,

25:07.460 --> 25:08.979
I'll be rigging up the twin-tub!

25:08.980 --> 25:11.780
You and Freddie haven't
a clean vest between you!

25:19.540 --> 25:20.580
Help!

25:22.020 --> 25:24.019
Stay where you are, Sister!

25:24.020 --> 25:25.579
Help! Help!

25:25.580 --> 25:28.540
Custer's Cavalry is on its way.

25:32.020 --> 25:33.979
There has been an intruder!

25:33.980 --> 25:35.059
What do you mean?

25:35.060 --> 25:39.899
The glass in the back door is
broken, our ramparts are breached,

25:39.900 --> 25:43.500
and the felon fled
with the lemon meringue pie!

25:45.140 --> 25:47.219
You're like a moth to a flame
with meringue,

25:47.220 --> 25:49.859
you needn't think we've forgotten
the queen of puddings!

25:49.860 --> 25:51.299
Ladies, please!

25:51.300 --> 25:53.819
I'm sure there is no need
to stage a burglary

25:53.820 --> 25:56.459
just because food has...
gone missing.

25:56.460 --> 25:59.899
She forgets.
I have eschewed all citrus

25:59.900 --> 26:02.539
since the dentist
stopped my teeth with mercury!

26:02.540 --> 26:06.779
The alchemical reaction
is too grievous to bear! Well, it...

26:06.780 --> 26:07.939
Sisters!

26:07.940 --> 26:10.619
I will make sure
Fred repairs the door,

26:10.620 --> 26:12.819
and ask Mrs B to make another pie.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.939
I don't know what she's going
to make it in,

26:14.940 --> 26:18.180
because whoever it was has waltzed
off with the dish into the bargain!

26:19.380 --> 26:22.059
Excuse me, ladies.
Who sent for you?

26:22.060 --> 26:24.819
It wasn't the Crown Jewels,
it was a lemon meringue.

26:24.820 --> 26:27.499
Lemon meringue? Never mind.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.299
I've actually called
about the Sally Harper case.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.219
Her parents telephoned the station.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.900
Is a midwife free to come with me
on a house call?

26:37.180 --> 26:38.220
Sally...

26:39.380 --> 26:41.219
..it's very important
that you understand

26:41.220 --> 26:43.939
that you aren't
in any sort of trouble.

26:43.940 --> 26:45.939
You're a policeman.

26:45.940 --> 26:48.019
Policeman don't punish people.

26:48.020 --> 26:50.979
They help them, too, like nurses do.

26:50.980 --> 26:53.260
You can trust
Constable Noakes, Sally.

26:54.380 --> 26:58.179
He wants me to tell him things.

26:58.180 --> 27:00.499
Did somebody ask you not to, Sally?

27:00.500 --> 27:02.979
What do we have to do
to get the bastard brought to book?

27:02.980 --> 27:04.899
Language, Bert -
in front of the nurse.

27:04.900 --> 27:06.859
What do we have to do?

27:06.860 --> 27:10.859
If the girl was normal,
and somebody knocked her up,

27:10.860 --> 27:13.819
I could go after
whoever it was with a hatchet.

27:13.820 --> 27:18.459
I could make him marry her,
I could make everything all right,

27:18.460 --> 27:20.739
but how can she ever be married?
She isn't normal!

27:20.740 --> 27:23.020
I am normal at St Gideon's!

27:24.140 --> 27:25.699
Come along, Sally.

27:25.700 --> 27:27.139
That's enough for now.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.299
We'll go to your bedroom,

27:28.300 --> 27:31.180
and you can tell me
if your tummy's feeling better.

27:33.780 --> 27:34.899
Is that it, then?

27:34.900 --> 27:38.259
Mr Harper, if Sally won't give us
any information, we can't prosecute.

27:38.260 --> 27:41.579
It'd be me you'd end up prosecuting
if you ever found him

27:41.580 --> 27:44.220
cos I'd throttle him to death
with my own bare hands!

27:53.620 --> 27:56.100
You mustn't let all
the shouting upset you.

27:57.100 --> 28:00.659
Fathers get very cross
when their daughters are hurt,

28:00.660 --> 28:02.899
or, at least, the nice ones do.

28:02.900 --> 28:04.580
Nobody hurt me.

28:05.740 --> 28:08.699
Sally, you're going to have a baby.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.139
You're not a silly girl,

28:10.140 --> 28:12.900
and I do believe
you understand what that means.

28:14.620 --> 28:20.179
I think you also understand
that the baby came about

28:20.180 --> 28:22.900
because something happened
with a man...

28:24.820 --> 28:29.060
..perhaps a man
who wanted to get very close to you.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.660
Yes.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.700
I know it's not an easy thing
to talk about.

28:40.620 --> 28:42.940
It was my boyfriend...

28:45.300 --> 28:46.700
..and it didn't hurt.

29:07.660 --> 29:09.179
Hello. Oh, lovely.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.900
Thank you very much. I'll just
take this round to the kitchen.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.259
Well, what about you?

29:18.260 --> 29:20.060
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

29:22.180 --> 29:24.740
Sally Harper to see Dr Turner.

29:27.300 --> 29:30.420
Come along, Sally.
You can bring your mother with you.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.419
See that?

29:36.420 --> 29:37.700
She's pregnant?

29:39.060 --> 29:42.779
We'll need to monitor your daughter
very closely, Mrs Harper.

29:42.780 --> 29:46.219
Pregnancy is very, very unusual
for girls like Sally,

29:46.220 --> 29:48.459
and we can't be sure things
will go smoothly.

29:48.460 --> 29:50.379
It's already a disaster.

29:50.380 --> 29:52.699
If she shows any signs
of going into labour,

29:52.700 --> 29:55.219
we will admit her
to the maternity home first,

29:55.220 --> 29:57.419
and then think about transfer
to hospital.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.619
Not hospital!

29:59.620 --> 30:01.619
I want to go back to St Gideon's!

30:01.620 --> 30:03.179
I won't have her upset.

30:03.180 --> 30:05.980
I won't have her any more scared
than she has to be.

30:09.420 --> 30:10.499
The difficulty is

30:10.500 --> 30:13.259
there are hardly any cases
in the literature.

30:13.260 --> 30:15.219
It seems an early birth is likely,

30:15.220 --> 30:18.300
but I'm scrabbling around,
trying to find any statistics.

30:19.500 --> 30:23.299
Well, perhaps we should just
put statistics to one side.

30:23.300 --> 30:26.579
Whoever is responsible, she got
pregnant without any trouble,

30:26.580 --> 30:29.339
and may well go to term,
and give birth quite naturally.

30:29.340 --> 30:32.779
I hope she does, because it gives us
time to prepare her,

30:32.780 --> 30:36.099
otherwise, she's going to give birth
without fully understanding

30:36.100 --> 30:39.099
what will happen.
She'll be traumatised.

30:39.100 --> 30:41.859
Which of you
does she trust the most?

30:41.860 --> 30:45.859
Me, I think... hope. And Chummy.

30:45.860 --> 30:48.179
Let's take each week as it comes.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.619
I don't want to
hand her over to The London,

30:50.620 --> 30:53.539
and have her made even more
of an object of curiosity.

30:53.540 --> 30:54.980
We'll look after her.

30:58.900 --> 31:02.499
Look, Sister, the mystery is over,

31:02.500 --> 31:04.699
found it behind the lean-to.

31:04.700 --> 31:06.179
It must have been a tramp!

31:06.180 --> 31:09.179
The poor thing's practically
eaten the pattern off the dish.

31:09.180 --> 31:11.219
I can remember when
your average down-and-out

31:11.220 --> 31:13.099
was glad of a slice
of bread and dripping.

31:13.100 --> 31:16.139
We'll have to save them
some titbits from your party.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.260
What party?!

31:21.220 --> 31:23.979
This would never have happened
with Sister Julienne in charge.

31:23.980 --> 31:27.579
Sister Julienne IS in charge.
I'm merely carrying out her orders.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.899
Well, I didn't give permission
for a party,

31:29.900 --> 31:32.859
and I didn't give permission
for anyone to write to my relations!

31:32.860 --> 31:36.660
I didn't think anyone needed
permission. It was done with love.

31:38.660 --> 31:41.299
It's a tradition
in the religious life.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.859
I think you forfeited
your right to lecture me

31:43.860 --> 31:47.059
or anyone else
on the religious life.

31:47.060 --> 31:50.140
There is to be no party.
Do you hear me?

31:55.740 --> 31:57.340
Thank you. Goodbye.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.579
Right, Nurse Mount,

32:00.580 --> 32:03.299
was that someone's waters breaking,
first couple of twinges,

32:03.300 --> 32:06.059
or an incoherent father
who's forgotten his own address?

32:06.060 --> 32:07.739
It was the cobbler, actually.

32:07.740 --> 32:09.859
He says your shoes
need completely resoling,

32:09.860 --> 32:11.259
and it's going to cost 18 and 6.

32:11.260 --> 32:14.140
Oh, no, it's not, because I'm
perfectly happy in my plimsolls.

32:16.220 --> 32:17.499
Nonnatus House?

32:17.500 --> 32:19.659
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking!

32:19.660 --> 32:22.140
Slow down, sir,
and I'll take your details.

32:31.380 --> 32:33.979
I've made several attempts
to contact the Harpers,

32:33.980 --> 32:36.059
but there's been no response.

32:36.060 --> 32:37.979
They're upset
that Sally keeps saying

32:37.980 --> 32:39.579
she wants to come back here,

32:39.580 --> 32:42.779
especially because she insists
that the baby was fathered by

32:42.780 --> 32:44.340
her "boyfriend".

32:46.220 --> 32:48.179
She's refused to say anything.

32:48.180 --> 32:49.659
Even to the police?

32:49.660 --> 32:51.659
Especially to the police.

32:51.660 --> 32:56.539
But, Miss Molyneux, we always
offer our patients confidentiality,

32:56.540 --> 32:59.059
and we've decided
that the best thing for Sally

32:59.060 --> 33:01.579
is to treat her
like any other pregnant woman.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.380
Sally isn't like
any other pregnant woman!

33:25.260 --> 33:27.659
Jacob...

33:27.660 --> 33:31.299
..could you weave some of your magic
for me and conjure up a cup of tea?

33:31.300 --> 33:32.780
On its way.

33:44.460 --> 33:45.540
Fares.

33:46.580 --> 33:51.939
I want to go to Dulacke Street,
Poplar, please.

33:51.940 --> 33:53.259
Sorry, mate?

33:53.260 --> 33:55.740
Dulacke Street, Poplar.

33:57.260 --> 33:58.820
It's on the paper.

34:00.460 --> 34:03.540
Ninepence, and you need to
get off at the Town Hall.

34:11.860 --> 34:15.139
Dulacke Street, please.

34:15.139 --> 34:17.940
Top of the street and turn left.
Thank you.

34:29.420 --> 34:33.179
Absolutely tiptop, young lady -
tiptop and tickety-boo.

34:40.020 --> 34:44.420
I would like to see my girlfriend,
please.

34:45.460 --> 34:46.819
You?

34:46.820 --> 34:48.018
Jacob?

34:48.020 --> 34:49.219
Sally!

34:54.940 --> 34:57.419
I didn't tell them.

34:57.420 --> 34:59.140
They didn't tell me.

35:00.980 --> 35:02.859
I don't care
if he's not right either.

35:02.860 --> 35:05.499
He's sharper in the head than
she is - he knew what he was doing!

35:05.500 --> 35:09.779
Ssh, Mrs Harper,
let's take this one step at a time.

35:09.780 --> 35:13.379
I took the bull by the horns,
and made a pot of Rosie Lee.

35:13.380 --> 35:17.819
Everyone needs a cup,
especially Jacob -

35:17.820 --> 35:19.619
he's had a very long journey.

35:19.620 --> 35:23.259
He'll have another long journey
back tonight.

35:23.260 --> 35:25.979
I wouldn't give him tea,
he'll just spill it everywhere.

35:25.980 --> 35:27.300
Thank you.

35:29.580 --> 35:32.899
When does Mr Harper come home?

35:32.900 --> 35:36.179
If I were you,
I'd clear out before he gets here.

35:36.180 --> 35:40.259
Because I'm going to ask him
if I can marry her.

35:40.260 --> 35:43.419
What good would that do?
You live in a home!

35:43.420 --> 35:45.739
You can't work. You can't keep her!

35:45.740 --> 35:47.659
I can do the decent thing.

35:47.660 --> 35:49.779
Oh, it's a bit bloody late
to talk about decency!

35:49.780 --> 35:52.059
Mrs Harper, that is enough.
Leave him alone!

35:52.060 --> 35:53.940
Stay calm, old thing, stay calm.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.019
I wanted to see her,

35:58.020 --> 36:02.219
because I wanted to know
she was looked after.

36:02.220 --> 36:04.259
She is... by me.

36:04.260 --> 36:06.259
And I'm glad,

36:06.260 --> 36:11.459
because there is a part of me
that you cannot see,

36:11.460 --> 36:12.940
but she can...

36:14.380 --> 36:19.740
..and if she is loved,
I can go on living.

36:33.620 --> 36:37.419
Cynthia, you simply wouldn't
believe the afternoon I've had -

36:37.420 --> 36:39.739
a retained placenta
in Castile Buildings,

36:39.740 --> 36:41.419
and then a false alarm
in Dove Street.

36:41.420 --> 36:44.979
It should have been Sister
Evangelina, but she'd gone AWOL.

36:44.980 --> 36:46.379
Oh, hello.

36:46.380 --> 36:48.459
This is Jacob, Trixie.

36:48.460 --> 36:53.739
He's... a very good friend
of Sally Harper's from St Gideon's.

36:53.740 --> 36:56.179
I'm just going to pop
over the street and ask Tom Hereward

36:56.180 --> 36:58.019
if he can arrange
a lift back for him.

36:58.020 --> 36:59.060
Of course.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.219
Well, I have to say, Jacob,

37:04.220 --> 37:06.940
you look as though your day's
been as gruelling as mine.

37:09.100 --> 37:12.979
I thought there were sausage rolls,
but they seem to have gone walkies

37:12.980 --> 37:16.059
and, yesterday, half a pound
of luncheon meat just vanished.

37:16.060 --> 37:17.699
We must have mice.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.140
Lucky mice.

37:21.220 --> 37:23.139
Ah!

37:23.140 --> 37:25.780
Scones. Left there to cool.

37:27.460 --> 37:29.060
Simply marvellous.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.340
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:41.740 --> 37:43.100
I need help.

37:45.820 --> 37:47.100
Of course.

38:06.020 --> 38:08.659
That was wonderful.

38:08.660 --> 38:12.419
Yes, the Sisters have just gone over
to Brooke Bond from Typhoo.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.019
I'm a Nescafe girl myself,

38:14.020 --> 38:16.779
so I just kept my head down,
out of the range of flying missiles.

38:16.780 --> 38:19.180
Chauffeur service.

38:21.020 --> 38:24.659
Mr Hereward, do be an angel
and butter those scones for us.

38:24.660 --> 38:26.580
Jacob's still drinking his tea.

38:39.060 --> 38:41.539
Sally's sleeping now.

38:41.540 --> 38:43.740
I think the upset tired her out.

38:45.620 --> 38:47.819
What'll happen to the baby?

38:47.820 --> 38:50.820
That will depend
on whether he or she...

38:52.180 --> 38:55.180
..is born with the same condition
as Sally. You mean backward?

38:56.180 --> 39:00.140
Dr Turner thinks the likelihood
could be as much as 50%.

39:01.220 --> 39:03.539
I hate the word "mongol".

39:03.540 --> 39:06.539
Mongols are a tribe,
they live abroad.

39:06.540 --> 39:08.579
I saw them at the pictures once.

39:08.580 --> 39:12.020
The Adventures Of Marco Polo
with Gary Cooper.

39:13.780 --> 39:16.179
Sally was just a little girl then.

39:16.180 --> 39:19.139
She wasn't perfect,
but she was ours,

39:19.140 --> 39:21.819
not something
from a foreign country.

39:21.820 --> 39:24.979
Nobody doubts how much you
love your daughter, Mrs Harper.

39:24.980 --> 39:27.299
I do doubt it.

39:27.300 --> 39:30.779
Let me say it, Nurse.
Please, let me say it.

39:30.780 --> 39:34.779
If I'd have loved Sally more,
would she have gone to him,

39:34.780 --> 39:36.579
would she have needed him?

39:36.580 --> 39:38.859
Would she have
even have let him near her?

39:38.860 --> 39:42.819
You mustn't blame yourself.
No matter what you feel.

39:42.820 --> 39:44.660
I don't know what I feel, Nurse.

39:46.020 --> 39:48.020
I do know
what I've never shown her.

39:53.660 --> 39:54.739
Come on.

39:54.740 --> 39:58.860
If you're lucky, we might still pick
up reception for Radio Luxembourg.

40:04.580 --> 40:06.220
Oh, his arms is dead strong!

40:12.380 --> 40:15.060
'Your radio's dialled
to Radio Luxembourg.'

40:23.260 --> 40:24.300
Sshh!

40:29.180 --> 40:30.980
I've only just put him down,
Camilla.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.459
I want to kiss him.

40:36.460 --> 40:38.180
Then he'll know how much he's loved.

40:42.260 --> 40:44.300
Yes. There's Daddy.

40:56.300 --> 40:57.700
Sister Monica Joan?

41:02.380 --> 41:03.540
Sister!

41:04.780 --> 41:05.980
Sister!

41:14.660 --> 41:15.899
Oh.

41:15.900 --> 41:19.220
I thought you were Sister Monica
Joan, got out in the night again.

41:20.220 --> 41:24.659
Constable Noakes,
can I show you something?

41:24.660 --> 41:25.860
Of course, Sister.

41:38.900 --> 41:40.220
Vincent?

41:41.340 --> 41:42.580
You've got company.

41:44.540 --> 41:46.059
Can a man not sleep?

41:46.060 --> 41:47.660
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

41:55.260 --> 41:57.619
Is he a meths drinker?

41:57.620 --> 41:58.860
Not yet.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.620
He's my brother.

42:07.300 --> 42:11.099
He's been fighting the bottle
since he opened his first pay packet.

42:11.100 --> 42:15.339
That's the trouble with drink.
It hates those who love it most.

42:15.340 --> 42:18.219
You needn't think
I feel sorry for you.

42:18.220 --> 42:20.739
You straightened yourself out
more than once.

42:20.740 --> 42:23.179
Drink follows people.

42:23.180 --> 42:26.700
It followed me.

42:29.100 --> 42:32.579
He's a sick man, Sister Evangelina.

42:32.580 --> 42:34.819
I'm going to call for an ambulance.

42:34.820 --> 42:37.459
Apart from anything else,
you're putting yourself in danger,

42:37.460 --> 42:39.899
crawling round derelict buildings
in the dead of night.

42:39.900 --> 42:41.819
I never made her.

42:41.820 --> 42:44.580
I tried to turn my back.
But I couldn't.

42:45.820 --> 42:50.419
In the past, when he's pitched up,
I've always kept it from my Sisters.

42:50.420 --> 42:53.379
I hadn't seen him
in three or four years,

42:53.380 --> 42:55.939
I started to think he must be dead.

42:55.940 --> 42:58.339
And then he got wind of my jubilee,
through some letter

42:58.340 --> 43:01.739
that was sent to the Seamen's Mission
and he came knocking on the door.

43:01.740 --> 43:03.579
Well, you can put
two and two together

43:03.580 --> 43:06.019
regarding the lemon meringue.

43:06.020 --> 43:07.900
Did him no good, by the look of it.

43:10.700 --> 43:13.220
I hated the life he chose.

43:14.980 --> 43:16.860
And he hated the life I chose.

43:18.380 --> 43:23.500
He used to say "Why, Enid? Why?
You're throwing your life away."

43:25.780 --> 43:27.180
The irony of it is...

43:30.700 --> 43:33.500
..he was the first baby
I saw being born.

43:36.820 --> 43:41.779
And it was his first cry
that decided it for me.

43:41.780 --> 43:44.620
There was... So full of hope.

43:48.020 --> 43:49.700
Everything made new.

43:52.540 --> 43:54.420
You see the good in everything.

43:55.580 --> 43:57.180
That's your curse.

43:58.660 --> 44:01.740
And you don't. And that's yours.

44:05.260 --> 44:07.859
So that's why she refused
to get her shoes mended?

44:07.860 --> 44:10.899
The reason she's been going around
in those filthy white plimsolls.

44:10.900 --> 44:13.219
I actually think
they look rather comfy.

44:13.220 --> 44:14.979
She felt
she was defrauding the Order,

44:14.980 --> 44:18.459
by taking food and bandages
without permission.

44:18.460 --> 44:21.139
And she didn't want a jubilee
in case her brother came.

44:21.140 --> 44:24.019
It's positively heartbreaking.

44:24.020 --> 44:29.899
♪ To thee all Angels cry aloud

44:29.900 --> 44:36.179
♪ To thee Cherubim and Seraphim

44:36.180 --> 44:41.059
♪ Continually do cry

44:41.060 --> 44:45.459
♪ Holy, Holy, Holy... ♪

44:45.460 --> 44:49.020
It's Sally Harper. So soon? Yes.

44:50.020 --> 44:54.860
♪ Heaven and Earth
are full of thy Majesty... ♪

44:59.900 --> 45:01.779
Sally, old bean...

45:01.780 --> 45:04.539
I know this bally mask
feels rotten.

45:04.540 --> 45:08.100
But, if you listen to me, I'll help
you breathe in the right way.

45:09.660 --> 45:12.899
I'm scared. I know.

45:12.900 --> 45:15.779
Eight fingers.

45:15.780 --> 45:17.859
Won't be much longer.

45:17.860 --> 45:19.620
I want to go home.

45:23.820 --> 45:27.219
It won't live.
They said it can't live.

45:27.220 --> 45:30.739
It's being born too soon,
be too small.

45:30.740 --> 45:32.459
Is the doctor going to come?

45:32.460 --> 45:34.140
They said he's on his way.

45:39.700 --> 45:43.380
I don't think I can bear it.
I know she can't. Nor can I.

45:48.300 --> 45:50.500
What-ho, Sally. Here comes Ma.

45:52.220 --> 45:53.420
Mum.

45:55.220 --> 45:58.299
I don't want no baby.
I know you don't.

45:58.300 --> 46:01.099
I don't want it.
Don't you worry about that now.

46:01.100 --> 46:03.940
You just be a good girl
for the nurses. Come on.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.620
Mummy loves you.

46:17.780 --> 46:20.579
Here we go. Keep going.

46:20.580 --> 46:23.340
Well done, Sally.

46:25.820 --> 46:28.740
You're going absolutely great guns,
Sally.

46:30.500 --> 46:32.659
That's it.

46:32.660 --> 46:34.100
Good girl.

46:56.220 --> 46:57.740
I haven't heard it cry yet.

47:01.940 --> 47:03.300
Is it hurt?

47:05.020 --> 47:07.100
It's just very, very little, Sally.

47:16.860 --> 47:19.140
It's just the placenta, Sally.

47:26.220 --> 47:28.100
Can I go home now?

47:34.900 --> 47:38.379
Hello, Jacob.
They keeping you hard at it?

47:38.380 --> 47:43.060
Miss Molyneux wants me
where she can see me.

47:45.260 --> 47:47.259
Will you sit down, Jacob?

47:47.260 --> 47:49.339
I need to talk to you.

47:49.340 --> 47:51.739
Is it about Sally?

47:51.740 --> 47:54.340
Yes. About Sally.

47:59.500 --> 48:01.700
And about the baby, too. I'm afraid.

48:04.860 --> 48:07.979
If Sally's mother wants her
to return to residential care,

48:07.980 --> 48:11.379
there is still a place for her
at St Gideon's.

48:11.380 --> 48:13.939
It's already been suggested
that we remove Jacob

48:13.940 --> 48:16.099
to an institution for males only.

48:16.100 --> 48:18.099
Because he can't be trusted
with Sally?

48:18.100 --> 48:20.659
Because he can't be trusted
with any young women.

48:20.660 --> 48:23.779
He was in a position of trust, as
much as a member of staff would be.

48:23.780 --> 48:26.019
Jacob loves Sally, Miss Molyneux.

48:26.020 --> 48:29.339
I know that.
At least, I know it now.

48:29.340 --> 48:32.219
But I also know
that Jacob needs to love,

48:32.220 --> 48:35.259
and be loved,
just like any other human being.

48:35.260 --> 48:39.419
And the board have decided he'd be
better off out of temptation's way.

48:39.420 --> 48:41.580
Have you asked Jacob his opinion?

48:42.860 --> 48:46.299
I would love to be like you,
Mr Hereward.

48:46.300 --> 48:51.379
I would love to be young and zealous
and full of ideals.

48:51.380 --> 48:54.219
But what happens in St Gideon's
is real,

48:54.220 --> 48:56.619
and compromised and shabby.

48:56.620 --> 48:58.259
And that can change.

48:58.260 --> 49:00.819
Maybe one day it will.

49:00.820 --> 49:03.180
For now, we must do the best we can.

49:07.260 --> 49:09.380
Sister Evangelina?

49:10.820 --> 49:13.179
I'm just giving this
a thorough seeing to.

49:13.180 --> 49:16.419
Before Nurse Mount gets to it
and deprives me of the pleasure.

49:16.420 --> 49:19.859
Dr Turner has arranged a bed
for your brother at The Maudsley.

49:19.860 --> 49:21.859
Mental hospital?

49:21.860 --> 49:23.819
He'll run rings
round those psychiatrists.

49:23.820 --> 49:26.219
He's sharp as a tack, always was.

49:26.220 --> 49:29.100
Sister, I know how fond of him
you are.

49:30.340 --> 49:33.660
Well, we can't choose
where we love, can we?

49:34.700 --> 49:35.979
No.

49:35.980 --> 49:39.179
Nor can we choose
what happens when we do.

49:39.180 --> 49:40.340
More's the pity.

49:42.460 --> 49:46.299
Sister Julienne
told me of your troubles

49:46.300 --> 49:49.419
when we were drawing up
the prayer list.

49:49.420 --> 49:50.940
Um...

49:54.780 --> 49:55.820
Listen...

49:57.820 --> 50:02.819
You already have a child, Shelagh -
his name is Timothy.

50:02.820 --> 50:06.339
And I know why,
because I delivered him.

50:06.340 --> 50:09.979
I didn't know. He was born
before I joined the Order.

50:09.980 --> 50:14.179
I can still see Dr Turner
putting him into his mother's arms.

50:14.180 --> 50:17.059
And she looked into that baby's face
and said,

50:17.060 --> 50:20.540
"I want you always to be loved."

50:22.140 --> 50:24.299
I'm afraid of loving him too much.

50:24.300 --> 50:26.580
Well, for whose sake? Yours or his?

50:29.020 --> 50:31.859
If there's one thing
the religious life has taught me,

50:31.860 --> 50:34.779
is it's impossible to love too much.

50:34.780 --> 50:36.459
What's needed is taken up,

50:36.460 --> 50:40.380
and what's not needed hangs around
somewhere, looking for a home.

50:41.420 --> 50:43.979
I've been given so much, Sister.

50:43.980 --> 50:47.099
All I want to do is pass it on.

50:47.100 --> 50:49.820
And I don't know how or to whom.

50:51.020 --> 50:55.220
Well, if I could answer that,
it would make me as wise as Him.

50:57.660 --> 51:01.099
You just bide your time.

51:01.100 --> 51:04.060
He'll show you his plan.
Mark my words.

51:08.220 --> 51:10.379
Jacob...

51:10.380 --> 51:14.019
you can stare as reproachfully at me
as you like.

51:14.020 --> 51:16.699
But you're going to move
to St Mungo's.

51:16.700 --> 51:19.939
No. I'm not.

51:19.940 --> 51:22.259
I appreciate that it's Ayrshire.

51:22.260 --> 51:24.979
But you do have family in Scotland.

51:24.980 --> 51:27.780
Have I? I wouldn't know.

51:29.980 --> 51:32.299
The board have agreed
to your transfer.

51:32.300 --> 51:35.299
I haven't agreed.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.179
Jacob...

51:37.180 --> 51:39.739
you can do this
kicking and screaming,

51:39.740 --> 51:43.700
or you can do it
with dignity and with grace.

51:45.460 --> 51:47.379
Please.

51:47.380 --> 51:51.259
Will it make any difference?

51:51.260 --> 51:53.420
It will make it bearable.

51:54.460 --> 51:55.500
For who?

51:56.900 --> 51:58.060
For you?

52:29.660 --> 52:31.100
Timothy Turner?

53:43.300 --> 53:46.940
I did it! Well done, son.

53:50.180 --> 53:52.779
I told you we'd be back
in time for lunch.

53:52.780 --> 53:54.539
Will you come and visit me?

53:54.540 --> 53:58.139
Of course.
I always did and I always will.

53:58.140 --> 54:00.339
And I'll need a new lipstick.

54:00.340 --> 54:03.700
As long as it's just a pink one.
Not too red!

54:06.140 --> 54:08.380
Jacob? Jacob!

54:10.460 --> 54:11.740
Jacob!

54:34.860 --> 54:38.099
Oh, tough luck.
Two dozen test tubes.

54:38.100 --> 54:40.619
They might be new,
but they're certainly not clean.

54:40.620 --> 54:43.219
What did your last slave die of?
I'm sorry.

54:43.220 --> 54:46.019
It's all frightfully inconvenient,
on the day of your jubilee.

54:46.020 --> 54:47.819
Nonsense. There's work to be done.

54:47.820 --> 54:50.499
I shall look forward to our
little tea in the parlour later.

54:50.500 --> 54:52.979
And at least we got the service
moved back to 4pm

54:52.980 --> 54:55.139
so that Sister Julienne
can get here.

54:55.140 --> 54:57.339
Bowls - kidney - six.

54:57.340 --> 55:01.579
Clamps - midwives -
for the use of - six.

55:01.580 --> 55:04.260
Sister Evangelina,
you're wanted at the door.

55:41.180 --> 55:44.660
May God bless you on your jubilee,
my dear Sister.

55:47.620 --> 55:49.299
Oh!

55:49.300 --> 55:51.860
Let's hope I get another
ten years out of these!

55:55.300 --> 55:57.419
You delivered me,
Sister Evangelina.

55:57.420 --> 56:00.739
And you delivered my Carol, too,
last year.

56:00.740 --> 56:03.620
Thank you very much. Thank you.

56:06.420 --> 56:08.300
I'm one of yours as well, Sister.

56:10.260 --> 56:12.579
And me.

56:12.580 --> 56:14.660
Thank you, Sister Evangelina.

56:15.740 --> 56:19.979
'Perfection
is not a polished thing.

56:19.980 --> 56:24.579
'It is often simply something
that is sincerely meant.

56:24.580 --> 56:28.099
'Perfection is a job complete,

56:28.100 --> 56:32.259
'praise given, prayer heard.

56:32.260 --> 56:35.539
'It can be kindness shown,

56:35.540 --> 56:37.740
'thanks offered up.'

56:53.420 --> 56:57.619
'Perfection is what
we discover in each other,

56:57.620 --> 57:00.020
'what we see reflected back.'

57:19.100 --> 57:20.660
Thank you.

57:27.820 --> 57:29.940
Well done, Sister.

57:32.820 --> 57:34.180
And well done, you.

57:39.340 --> 57:41.660
Oh!

57:43.380 --> 57:48.859
'And if perfection eludes us,
that doesn't matter.

57:48.860 --> 57:52.300
'For what we have
within the moment is enough.'

58:10.700 --> 58:13.940
Dad said I wasn't to trouble you,
but he's got really bad.

58:17.420 --> 58:20.259
If you want him
to stay a bastard, that's fine!

58:20.260 --> 58:22.859
Let's not get ourselves married!

58:22.860 --> 58:25.100
Declan's not always so unpleasant.

58:27.340 --> 58:29.819
This is Colin.
Hello, Timothy's mum and dad.

58:29.820 --> 58:31.699
Hello.

58:31.700 --> 58:34.859
I must say I find
Mr Herewood very... agreeable.

58:34.860 --> 58:36.059
So do I.

58:36.060 --> 58:39.320
Hello. Good morning.
You look lovely. You look very nice.
