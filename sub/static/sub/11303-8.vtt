00:42.347 --> 00:43.713
Morning.

00:49.187 --> 00:52.889
- How are you today, Mr. Proctor?
- That depends.

00:52.991 --> 00:57.994
- You brought me another head?
- No.

00:58.096 --> 01:00.196
Thinking I might leave with one, though.

01:10.241 --> 01:14.043
- You killed my men.
- You stole my drugs.

01:15.313 --> 01:17.280
You know, there's nothing more annoying

01:17.382 --> 01:19.849
than an old guy thinking
he's still running things.

01:19.951 --> 01:21.784
<i>Bunker, you little shit.</i>

01:21.886 --> 01:24.587
I believe you know our
mutual friend Senator Mitchum.

01:24.689 --> 01:27.757
Put that knife away before I cut out
your fucking eyes with it.

01:27.859 --> 01:31.360
Mr. Mitchum, what are you doing here, sir?

01:31.462 --> 01:33.529
What am I doing here?

01:33.631 --> 01:37.333
You murdered my fucking lieutenant
is what I'm doing here.

01:37.435 --> 01:42.171
- Sir, he was selling us out.
- He was acting on orders.

01:44.809 --> 01:48.444
You and Proctor?
Sir, I don't understand.

01:48.546 --> 01:50.112
That's 'cause you're a fucking idiot.

01:50.215 --> 01:54.350
This little insurrection stops here.
Do you hear me?

01:54.452 --> 01:56.986
- Do you hear me?!
- Yes, sir!

01:57.088 --> 02:02.625
<i>You have been misled by this imbecile.</i>

02:02.727 --> 02:06.662
<i>The minute he killed one of our own...</i>

02:07.498 --> 02:09.699
you should have torn him to pieces.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.468
But maybe it's time to remind
you that the Brotherhood

02:12.570 --> 02:16.405
goes way beyond Banshee, Pennsylvania.

02:16.507 --> 02:19.008
<i>You're part of a national movement,</i>

02:19.110 --> 02:23.646
<i>one that not only shares your beliefs,
but is willing to do something about it.</i>

02:25.783 --> 02:27.717
This is Monty.

02:27.819 --> 02:30.353
He's gonna be running
things from now on.

02:30.455 --> 02:34.617
- Make sure things go smoothly from here on out.
- You cannot come here...

02:37.295 --> 02:41.097
Smartest thing for you to do right now
is shut the fuck up.

02:41.199 --> 02:42.732
Do you hear me?

02:46.938 --> 02:50.106
Your first and only priority
is Mr. Proctor's delivery.

02:50.208 --> 02:54.210
Once that happens,
Monty will evaluate the chapter,

02:54.312 --> 02:58.547
choose a new captain.
Any questions?

02:58.650 --> 03:03.152
Okay, go on.
Get out of here.

03:29.914 --> 03:32.376
Is he gonna be a problem?

03:33.818 --> 03:36.719
You have my permission
to shoot him if he is.

04:50.984 --> 04:54.334
<b>4x08 - "Requiem"</b>

05:16.954 --> 05:18.554
I didn't think you'd come.

05:20.358 --> 05:22.458
I wanted to make sure I said good-bye.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.427
Feels like that's pretty
much what we do, right?

05:24.529 --> 05:27.158
Yeah, it's kind of a bad habit, huh?

05:31.035 --> 05:34.703
- So, college.
- Yeah.

05:36.007 --> 05:38.307
I give it about three months.

05:39.944 --> 05:42.912
With everything that's happened,

05:43.014 --> 05:45.748
I just don't know how I can
possibly fit into someplace

05:45.850 --> 05:51.086
- as normal as college.
- Nah, you're gonna do great.

05:52.824 --> 05:54.590
I don't know.

05:54.692 --> 05:58.727
I think normal might not
be in my repertoire anymore.

06:01.098 --> 06:03.766
Hey, you know what's
great about being your age?

06:05.937 --> 06:09.705
You got all the time in the
world to figure things out.

06:09.807 --> 06:14.210
You do.
And you will.

06:16.481 --> 06:18.614
You're strong, Deva.

06:20.451 --> 06:24.253
You're a fighter.
Like your mother.

06:26.791 --> 06:28.924
And your father.

06:33.431 --> 06:35.197
You're gonna do great.

06:39.904 --> 06:42.271
And now I'll always
know where to find you.

06:44.108 --> 06:47.309
And will you? Find me?

06:49.247 --> 06:51.046
Promise.

06:53.985 --> 06:56.552
Good.
You might be a shitty father,

06:56.654 --> 06:59.922
but you're the only one I got left.

07:03.928 --> 07:09.565
<i>So Declan believed that
the Devil spoke to him.</i>

07:09.667 --> 07:14.970
- Satan did speak to him.
- Okay. So you believed it, too.

07:15.072 --> 07:19.842
Something that's true
doesn't require your belief.

07:19.944 --> 07:22.912
Well, I guess I can't
argue with you there.

07:24.682 --> 07:27.650
You need to understand
he didn't choose this.

07:30.187 --> 07:32.121
He was chosen.

07:34.492 --> 07:36.792
<i>So how did he pick 'em?</i>

07:38.462 --> 07:42.498
<i>He chose girls
that seemed to him to be pure.</i>

07:44.201 --> 07:46.602
He called them blessed.

07:48.506 --> 07:51.807
- Blessed girls.
- Well, he did want to offer me

07:51.909 --> 07:54.877
and I don't think he thought
I was blessed.

07:57.515 --> 07:59.448
You were a surprise.

08:01.552 --> 08:05.988
- But I wasn't the only surprise, was I?
- What do you mean?

08:06.090 --> 08:08.857
Well, Declan was
killing on a lunar cycle.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.360
Not every month,
but always on a new moon.

08:11.462 --> 08:14.029
- When the night is darkest.
- Right.

08:17.401 --> 08:22.004
Except for... her.

08:24.275 --> 08:27.610
She was killed on the 21st.

08:27.712 --> 08:31.080
<i>Not a new moon.
Not a full moon.</i>

08:32.750 --> 08:35.384
Just an unremarkable night.

08:40.323 --> 08:43.424
We had our reasons.

08:46.130 --> 08:47.696
So you were in on it?

08:47.798 --> 08:53.302
Of course I was.
We were in it together.

08:53.404 --> 08:58.173
So then tell me, why did you choose her?
Rebecca Bowman.

08:58.275 --> 09:01.844
<i>What was it about her
that made you and Declan</i>

09:01.946 --> 09:05.848
<i>decide to break out of the lunar cycle?</i>

09:05.950 --> 09:07.916
<i>Was she a surprise, too?</i>

09:16.861 --> 09:18.894
I don't want to talk anymore.

09:24.035 --> 09:26.835
- You did the final count?
- Yes.

09:26.937 --> 09:29.171
- It's all there.
- Good.

09:29.273 --> 09:32.007
Bring the truck to the designated
point and wait for my call.

09:32.109 --> 09:33.208
We'll be ready.

09:35.723 --> 09:37.046
<i>Close it up.</i>

09:40.551 --> 09:42.217
<i>We're set.</i>

09:56.267 --> 10:03.338
- That is a lot of dead skinheads.
- Looks like a bomb went off in here.

10:03.441 --> 10:07.076
- Any idea where your brother is?
- No.

10:07.178 --> 10:08.844
Still looking.

10:11.015 --> 10:13.882
You get the feeling there's something
going on that we don't know about?

10:17.655 --> 10:20.422
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

10:20.524 --> 10:21.890
This is Bunker.

10:21.992 --> 10:24.193
Proctor's deal of the
century is going down now.

10:24.295 --> 10:26.829
This is a really bad time.

10:26.931 --> 10:28.764
<i>I'm sorry. Should I try and stall</i>

10:28.866 --> 10:31.366
<i>the Colombian men who just
flew in on a private jet?</i>

10:31.469 --> 10:35.270
- Cartel?
- That would be my guess if I cared.

10:35.372 --> 10:39.808
- Jesus. Where are you?
- I'm at the old Municipal Airport.

10:39.910 --> 10:41.510
<i>All right, I'll meet you there.</i>

10:41.612 --> 10:43.878
Can I see that for a sec?

10:46.684 --> 10:48.517
Mrs. Hopewell, I presume.

10:51.055 --> 10:52.621
Brock?

10:59.130 --> 11:02.397
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:05.903 --> 11:11.507
- How's the interrogation going?
- It's going.

11:13.244 --> 11:18.080
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah. I'm just kind of...

11:18.182 --> 11:20.149
rolling through it, you know?

11:21.719 --> 11:25.420
You made pretty good backup, by the way.

11:25.523 --> 11:28.423
Guess I always thought
you were my backup.

11:28.526 --> 11:30.926
Yeah, no.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.800
Well, I just came to say good-bye.

11:40.571 --> 11:45.274
Hey...
Declan Bode didn't kill Rebecca.

11:47.178 --> 11:51.013
- What?
- Bode was killing on a lunar cycle.

11:51.115 --> 11:55.083
Now, Rebecca's killing stood out
because it wasn't on a new moon.

11:55.186 --> 11:57.352
<i>Now, I pressed Lilith about it and...</i>

11:57.454 --> 11:59.888
she made a bunch of
noise, but behind it all,

11:59.990 --> 12:02.558
I don't think
she knew anything about it.

12:03.761 --> 12:05.627
Well, maybe Bode didn't tell her.

12:05.729 --> 12:08.664
No, it doesn't make sense that
Bode would break his routine.

12:08.766 --> 12:11.099
So, what, you're saying
there's someone else out there

12:11.202 --> 12:13.168
killing girls and then
cutting out their hearts?

12:13.270 --> 12:15.437
I'm telling you that
someone killed Rebecca

12:15.539 --> 12:17.372
and made it look like it was Bode.

12:17.474 --> 12:20.075
They'd have to know details
about the other murders, right?

12:20.177 --> 12:23.345
- Mm-hmm.
- They haven't been released.

12:23.447 --> 12:27.316
Right, so we're looking for
someone who had access to BSD files

12:27.418 --> 12:31.620
and who's capable of a sadistic,
ritualistic murder like that.

12:31.722 --> 12:34.089
- Oh, fuck.
- Can you think of anyone?

12:53.244 --> 12:55.177
Hey, maybe you should
let me do the talking.

12:56.313 --> 12:57.746
Sure.

13:03.020 --> 13:06.788
They're not home.
Let's take a look around.

13:28.245 --> 13:31.113
<i>- Mr. Proctor.
- Se?or Loera.</i>

13:31.215 --> 13:35.984
- Good to see you again.
- I must admit I'm a little surprised

13:36.086 --> 13:37.953
that you were able to pull this off.

13:38.055 --> 13:40.455
I don't promise what I can't deliver.

13:47.998 --> 13:49.498
Bring it up.

14:10.654 --> 14:12.187
<i>Show me.</i>

14:18.996 --> 14:20.495
Hi.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.834
As long as we all whipping our shit out...

14:29.540 --> 14:34.509
- Emilio Loera, I take it?
- Who the fuck are you?

14:35.946 --> 14:37.279
I'm nobody.

14:37.381 --> 14:40.549
You know my name,
so you know who I am.

14:40.651 --> 14:42.884
Which means you know
what kind of a mistake

14:42.987 --> 14:44.886
it would be to try
to steal from me, right?

14:44.989 --> 14:48.323
I wouldn't dream of stealing from you.

14:48.425 --> 14:51.560
No, I came here to provide
you with a valuable service.

14:51.662 --> 14:55.397
Oh, yeah?
Which is what?

14:55.499 --> 14:59.401
I came to show you that Mr. Proctor
was mistaken when he told you

14:59.402 --> 15:03.538
<i>that Banshee was a safe place for
you to set up your manufacturing.</i>

15:03.640 --> 15:07.075
Very mistaken.

15:07.177 --> 15:09.978
I mean, if he had it so locked down,

15:10.080 --> 15:11.947
how did I steal this truck
full of all these drugs?

15:12.049 --> 15:14.783
- I'm gonna fucking slit your throat.
- Stop.

15:16.387 --> 15:21.757
I suppose you have some fee
in mind for this service.

15:21.859 --> 15:26.561
<i>No. Sometimes a service is
its own reward.</i>

15:26.663 --> 15:29.865
Just let my friend and
me walk away right now

15:29.967 --> 15:32.200
and we'll call it even.

15:50.421 --> 15:52.854
Start walking.

15:52.956 --> 15:54.790
You're not just gonna
let her walk out of here?

15:54.892 --> 15:56.491
Shut up.

16:13.544 --> 16:15.477
Hey, Miss Nobody.

16:18.248 --> 16:20.982
Did you really think
that I was gonna let you leave?

16:23.720 --> 16:27.189
No, actually, I didn't.

16:46.777 --> 16:50.245
That's right. Someone just
blew up your fucking drugs.

17:07.164 --> 17:09.064
<i>Nice shot.</i>

17:09.165 --> 17:10.699
Thanks.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.034
You know, you really need
to stop doing this shit.

17:14.438 --> 17:16.671
<i>- You invited yourself.
- I'm serious.</i>

17:16.772 --> 17:19.875
<i>It's become like a bad habit with you.</i>

17:19.977 --> 17:23.244
- This was the last time.
- I've heard that shit before.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.617
This is a very nice car.

18:05.589 --> 18:07.989
Son of a bitch!

19:07.551 --> 19:10.952
Oh, come on. No one really
knows how to do that.

19:11.054 --> 19:13.355
It's just a matter of
applying the right torque

19:13.457 --> 19:17.125
<i>and then a little bit of scrubbing.</i>

19:23.934 --> 19:25.867
Toolshed.

19:52.195 --> 19:53.595
Look at you.

19:53.697 --> 19:56.898
If there's one thing
I've learned lately,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.869
it's that there's always a basement.

20:14.484 --> 20:16.117
Right over here.

20:24.027 --> 20:25.727
We got blood.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.133
Yeah.

20:43.647 --> 20:45.480
What do you think?

20:49.786 --> 20:53.254
I think nothing good
happens in basements.

21:04.334 --> 21:06.067
Jesus.

21:40.303 --> 21:42.670
<i>You find anything else over there?</i>

21:44.741 --> 21:48.610
No.
No, nothing.

21:48.712 --> 21:50.912
All right, well, I say we head up.

21:51.014 --> 21:53.348
I can get forensics down
here in a couple hours.

21:53.450 --> 21:55.850
I want to find out whose blood that is.

21:57.254 --> 22:01.389
Sure. You mind if I don't
stick around for that?

22:03.960 --> 22:06.261
I got to check in on someone.

22:06.363 --> 22:10.698
- You got to check in on someone?
- Yeah.

22:13.170 --> 22:16.204
Hey, you want or need company?

22:18.508 --> 22:20.308
Not this time.

22:32.622 --> 22:34.422
<i>The cartel will come after you.</i>

22:34.524 --> 22:36.224
I know.

22:38.094 --> 22:43.932
- And what then?
- There'll be time to negotiate.

22:44.034 --> 22:46.054
But before then...

23:38.421 --> 23:40.955
- You...
- That looks broken.

23:42.192 --> 23:43.858
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

23:43.960 --> 23:46.160
<i>Oh, what the fuck? Hey!</i>

23:56.206 --> 24:00.275
- That's Rebecca's necklace.
- Yes, it is.

24:00.377 --> 24:03.945
- I don't understand.
- Bode didn't kill Rebecca.

24:05.649 --> 24:09.884
- You? You killed her?
- I found this in your shed.

24:09.986 --> 24:12.587
- You think I killed her?
- That's right.

24:12.689 --> 24:14.289
Are you out of your fucking mind?

24:14.391 --> 24:15.857
<i>I loved her.
I would have died for her.</i>

24:15.959 --> 24:17.992
- Yeah, maybe you loved her a little too much.
- What?

24:18.094 --> 24:20.528
When you found out she was pregnant, you
realized you couldn't control her again,

24:20.630 --> 24:22.564
so you took her down in that
weird little dungeon of yours

24:22.666 --> 24:24.532
- and you butchered her.
- What the hell are you talking about, dungeon?

24:24.634 --> 24:26.134
- You killed her!
- What the fuck are you talking about?

24:26.236 --> 24:28.603
You found out she was
pregnant and you killed her!

24:28.705 --> 24:30.638
No! No, I didn't!

24:33.543 --> 24:35.677
<i>I didn't kill her.</i>

24:49.626 --> 24:51.492
Shit.

24:53.697 --> 24:55.129
What the fuck?

25:00.036 --> 25:03.071
You son of a bitch.

25:03.173 --> 25:05.073
<i>He'll kill you for this.</i>

28:33.983 --> 28:37.118
<i>And will you? Find me?</i>

28:38.955 --> 28:40.454
<i>Promise.</i>

30:49.752 --> 30:53.220
Ev...
Everything I did...

30:56.559 --> 30:59.393
...I did for you.

31:00.129 --> 31:02.730
<i>Untie me!</i>

31:02.832 --> 31:07.468
- Untie me, you son of a bitch!
- You're ruining him.

31:07.570 --> 31:09.603
I can't let that happen anymore.

31:11.374 --> 31:15.376
He loves me.
You... You don't understand.

31:15.478 --> 31:18.079
Don't do this.

31:20.516 --> 31:25.119
He doesn't see you...
but I do.

31:25.221 --> 31:27.922
- I see you.
- Burton, please.

31:28.024 --> 31:32.093
I see you!

31:32.195 --> 31:34.695
Please.

31:35.832 --> 31:38.933
- I'm sorry.
- I'm... I'm sorry.

31:42.538 --> 31:43.738
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

31:43.840 --> 31:45.940
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

31:46.009 --> 31:47.775
I'm sorry.

31:47.844 --> 31:50.578
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

31:50.680 --> 31:52.480
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

31:53.549 --> 31:55.583
<i>I'm... I'm...</i>

31:55.685 --> 31:58.586
It's okay.

31:58.688 --> 32:01.322
- It's all right, Burton.
- I'm sorry.

32:01.424 --> 32:02.757
It's all right.

32:56.446 --> 33:00.181
- Did you hear anything?
- Nothing yet.

33:04.887 --> 33:07.054
- Kurt.
- I know.

33:12.195 --> 33:15.398
<i>- Kurt!
- Oh, my God, Calvin.</i>

33:18.401 --> 33:20.134
Maggie, go inside.

33:27.276 --> 33:29.643
<i>So you and Maggie, huh?</i>

33:32.915 --> 33:34.682
Oh, I guess I should
have seen that coming.

33:34.784 --> 33:36.584
She was always a sucker
for wounded birds.

33:36.686 --> 33:41.722
- Just walk away, Calvin.
- No, I'm not going to walk away, Kurt.

33:41.824 --> 33:45.493
I can't. I mean, a man
can only take so much,

33:45.595 --> 33:47.061
can only swallow so much shit

33:47.163 --> 33:48.963
<i>before the time comes
to address it, right?</i>

33:49.065 --> 33:51.265
I'm sorry.
I didn't expect this to happen.

33:51.367 --> 33:53.400
You're sorry? You're sorry you
ever joined the Brotherhood?

33:53.503 --> 33:54.802
You're sorry you brought me into it?

33:54.904 --> 33:57.037
You're sorry you fucked my wife?!

34:01.410 --> 34:03.611
You're just one sorry
piece of shit, aren't you?

34:04.914 --> 34:06.780
I will shoot you.

34:10.585 --> 34:14.588
Go ahead, Kurt.
Shoot me.

34:16.259 --> 34:17.625
Then you get Maggie free and clear.

34:17.726 --> 34:20.427
You can move into my house...

34:20.530 --> 34:23.030
raise my son.

34:26.202 --> 34:28.636
Come on, Kurt.

34:28.737 --> 34:31.237
Why build your own life
when you can just steal mine?

34:31.340 --> 34:32.572
- Shut up.
- Shoot me.

34:32.675 --> 34:34.708
- Shut up.
- Shoot me!

34:39.549 --> 34:42.808
Please just walk away.

35:01.070 --> 35:02.803
Do it. Go ahead.

35:30.199 --> 35:33.000
Motherfucker.

35:34.604 --> 35:37.171
Give me that fucking gun.

35:37.273 --> 35:39.773
God damn it.

35:39.875 --> 35:41.308
Oh, shit.

36:57.653 --> 36:59.520
Maggie!

37:03.326 --> 37:06.593
There's nowhere you can go,
either of you.

37:06.696 --> 37:10.064
I will find you
and I will make you pay!

37:10.166 --> 37:12.866
<i>Even if you lock me up, the
Brotherhood will hunt you down.</i>

37:12.968 --> 37:16.270
You know it. They will slit
your throat in front of her

37:16.372 --> 37:18.605
and then tear her ass to pieces!

37:18.708 --> 37:21.709
<i>There's nowhere you can
go that we won't find you.</i>

37:21.811 --> 37:26.780
I will kill my own son
before I let you raise him.

37:26.882 --> 37:29.783
<i>I'm gonna kill you, you bitch.</i>

37:39.362 --> 37:43.797
As long as I'm alive, I will...

37:51.040 --> 37:53.373
<i>♪ Roam ♪</i>

37:55.044 --> 37:58.812

38:23.506 --> 38:27.207

39:31.474 --> 39:35.075
Well, I should have known better
than to let you go off like that.

39:38.180 --> 39:40.447
How'd your forensics team do?

39:40.549 --> 39:42.683
<i>They found some skin samples.</i>

39:42.785 --> 39:44.384
Probably gonna match Proctor's.

39:44.487 --> 39:47.554
<i>It turns out it wasn't actually him.</i>

39:49.725 --> 39:53.527
- It was Burton.
- Burton?

39:53.629 --> 39:57.431
Yeah.
Guy with the glasses.

39:58.767 --> 40:01.101
His butler or whatever.

40:03.739 --> 40:07.307
The butler did it?
Seriously?

40:09.979 --> 40:14.448
Well, I should probably go
arrest this butler Burton, no?

40:19.455 --> 40:23.290
Right.
Should have guessed.

40:28.697 --> 40:34.101
<i>- Then I guess my job here is done.
- Yeah, me, too.</i>

40:34.203 --> 40:35.969
Me, too.

40:37.740 --> 40:40.274
It's about time I moved on.

40:42.278 --> 40:45.212
It's been time a couple
of times, actually.

40:58.928 --> 41:02.996
Well, if you're ever in D.C....

41:04.633 --> 41:06.266
look me up.

41:10.339 --> 41:12.172
I will.

42:35.324 --> 42:37.424
- Morning.
- Oh, thank God.

42:37.526 --> 42:40.627
Real coffee. Yes.

42:42.798 --> 42:44.464
- How's Maggie doing?
- She's okay.

42:44.566 --> 42:48.168
- They'll be out of your place by tonight.
- No rush.

42:50.773 --> 42:53.040
Let me see if I got this straight.

42:54.677 --> 42:56.943
Calvin got the jump on you,
beat the shit out of you,

42:57.046 --> 42:59.246
<i>then somewhere along the way,
you remember you got a gun</i>

42:59.348 --> 43:02.649
and you shoot him from 20 feet away.
Is that it?

43:03.852 --> 43:06.019
<i>- Yeah.
- Bullshit.</i>

43:06.121 --> 43:10.057
Sir, ahem, I'm not sure what
you're trying to imply, but...

43:10.159 --> 43:12.159
<i>I'm not implying anything.
I'm saying it.</i>

43:12.261 --> 43:14.928
You beat the shit out of Calvin and
then you killed him for good measure.

43:15.030 --> 43:18.532
Hey, Bunker, relax.

43:18.634 --> 43:20.734
It's just you and me talking here, okay?

43:20.836 --> 43:22.469
<i>Come on, sit down.</i>

43:40.456 --> 43:43.156
I don't know what it is
about this town, Bunker.

43:43.258 --> 43:46.226
<i>What geographic phenomenon
makes us a magnet</i>

43:46.328 --> 43:48.995
<i>for every scumbag and criminal
East of the Mississippi.</i>

43:49.098 --> 43:52.365
But what I do know
is that to do this job,

43:52.468 --> 43:55.736
sometimes you've got to take
off these badges and get bloody.

43:55.838 --> 43:58.305
<i>It's happened before
and it'll happen again.</i>

43:58.407 --> 44:00.507
<i>And I got to know that I can trust you.</i>

44:00.609 --> 44:02.776
And you can trust me.
You understand?

44:02.878 --> 44:06.313
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

44:06.415 --> 44:09.149
A little trust would
be nice around here.

44:13.122 --> 44:15.288
Kurt Bunker, that's
your real name, right?

44:16.992 --> 44:18.692
Just...

44:20.729 --> 44:22.362
So what about Proctor?

44:22.464 --> 44:24.865
<i>You can place him at the
scene of the drug deal.</i>

44:24.967 --> 44:27.518
Yeah, we could arrest
Proctor. But I got a feeling

44:27.519 --> 44:30.070
that the cartel's gonna
want a few words with him

44:30.172 --> 44:32.473
about their dead men, and when
they come, I'd just as soon

44:32.474 --> 44:34.775
he's as far away from the
police station as possible.

44:34.877 --> 44:37.010
- If you take my meaning.
- That makes sense.

44:37.112 --> 44:40.046
Time and experience, son.
Time and experience.

44:40.149 --> 44:43.483
So, you go write up that
bullshit report so I can sign it.

44:43.585 --> 44:45.185
Yes, sir.

44:46.922 --> 44:50.557
- Thank you, sir.
- Thanks for the coffee.

46:16.445 --> 46:18.211
<i>Look at your face.</i>

46:18.313 --> 46:21.381
You just can't help yourself, can you?

46:21.483 --> 46:24.117
I gotta be me.

46:25.621 --> 46:27.621
<i>I know.</i>

46:49.544 --> 46:53.446
- Max comes back tomorrow.
- That's great.

46:53.548 --> 46:55.148
Yes.

46:58.787 --> 47:01.221
Job tells me you're
heading out to New York.

47:01.323 --> 47:03.123
Yeah. Well, he is.

47:03.225 --> 47:07.527
I'm gonna take the scenic route,
catch up with him.

47:12.301 --> 47:14.067
Where are you headed?

47:16.705 --> 47:19.439
I don't know. I'm gonna...

47:19.541 --> 47:24.059
hit the road and see what happens.

47:24.947 --> 47:28.841
- You want to come?
- Hmm.

47:35.023 --> 47:36.356
Yeah.

47:40.729 --> 47:42.762
You be careful.

47:47.302 --> 47:51.271
<i>Yeah. I will.</i>

47:55.043 --> 47:57.677
You know, the whole ti...

47:58.613 --> 48:00.814
<i>all those years in my cell,</i>

48:00.916 --> 48:02.549
<i>you were always there with me.</i>

48:02.651 --> 48:04.050
I'm still there with you.

48:07.356 --> 48:09.622
And I'll always be here.

48:13.195 --> 48:14.627
No one else...

48:19.301 --> 48:22.702
nobody ever really knew me.

48:24.339 --> 48:25.705
I know.

48:56.505 --> 48:58.571
Please don't forget about me.

49:03.545 --> 49:05.178
Never.

49:07.115 --> 49:09.015
Never.

49:40.615 --> 49:42.549
Good-bye, Ana.

49:47.622 --> 49:49.789
It's Carrie.

50:22.757 --> 50:27.026
- This was a hard car to find.
- Yeah, sorry.

50:27.129 --> 50:29.162
I should have figured that
once I loaned it to you,

50:29.264 --> 50:32.599
odds were that I wouldn't be
getting it back in one piece.

50:32.701 --> 50:37.270
- How you plan on getting out of here?
- Same way I came in.

50:41.910 --> 50:44.477
<i>It's gonna be
mighty quiet around here.</i>

50:44.579 --> 50:47.347
Don't even pretend like
you're gonna miss me.

50:47.449 --> 50:49.749
I was talking to Hood.

50:51.987 --> 50:54.554
You know, I think I'm
actually gonna miss this place.

50:54.656 --> 50:56.856
<i>I know I'm not.</i>

50:58.126 --> 51:00.994
Sugar, it's been a thin slice of heaven.

51:01.096 --> 51:04.531
- I know you don't mean that.
- It's true, I don't.

51:04.633 --> 51:07.367
- You in a rush?
- Damn right.

51:07.469 --> 51:09.435
Every time I try to get out
of this motherfucking place,

51:09.538 --> 51:11.204
some shit goes down
and I get stuck in it.

51:11.306 --> 51:13.606
<i>I'm getting while the getting's good.</i>

51:13.708 --> 51:15.708
But before I do...

51:17.679 --> 51:19.779
figured I'd pay my tab.

51:38.733 --> 51:41.000
Where the hell did you get this?

51:42.270 --> 51:44.204
Now, you know better than to ask.

51:44.306 --> 51:48.541
<i>Point is, you spent your
retirement fund getting me out.</i>

51:48.643 --> 51:52.178
Well, you're too old to
be slinging drinks, so...

51:55.951 --> 51:57.517
Thank you.

52:00.088 --> 52:01.754
You know how to reach me?

52:01.856 --> 52:05.091
No one knows how to reach you.

52:05.193 --> 52:07.860
- He does.
- Yeah, I do.

52:10.432 --> 52:12.298
This is where I leave you.

52:19.975 --> 52:22.959
Banshee, Pennsylvania...

52:24.179 --> 52:26.012
...suck my tit!

55:01.570 --> 55:03.369
What?

55:06.408 --> 55:11.177
I was just remembering
the first time you walked in here.

55:11.279 --> 55:14.306
<i>I never could have imagined.</i>

55:14.607 --> 55:17.334
You know, some might say

55:17.335 --> 55:20.453
you weren't all that bad
at that whole sheriff thing.

55:20.555 --> 55:22.822
<i>Yeah, and other people might say</i>

55:22.924 --> 55:25.792
I was the worst fucking thing
that ever happened to this town.

55:31.599 --> 55:33.166
You got a place to stay?

55:33.268 --> 55:35.902
<i>Putting that badge on the way you did,</i>

55:36.004 --> 55:38.971
I never thought you'd
be walking out of here

55:39.073 --> 55:41.174
on your own two feet.

55:41.276 --> 55:43.075
<i>Neither did I.</i>

55:47.115 --> 55:49.849
You know, I probably wouldn't
if it wasn't for you.

55:55.490 --> 55:57.924
<i>You know you
hid up on that mountain</i>

55:57.992 --> 56:01.194
<i>because you felt the need
to atone for something.</i>

56:01.296 --> 56:03.596
And for all we know,
you'd still be there

56:03.698 --> 56:06.265
if Brock hadn't come
and pulled you down.

56:09.204 --> 56:10.770
<i>We are cons.</i>

56:10.872 --> 56:14.340
<i>We're made to believe
that you pay for your sins</i>

56:14.442 --> 56:17.310
<i>by getting locked up.</i>

56:17.412 --> 56:19.812
But maybe the way to redemption

56:19.914 --> 56:22.415
<i>isn't hiding on the mountain.</i>

56:22.550 --> 56:26.385
<i>Maybe it's about
choosing another road</i>

56:26.488 --> 56:29.388
down here with the rest of us.

56:30.792 --> 56:32.291
Maybe.

56:44.806 --> 56:50.176
<i>The past has kept you
locked up long enough.</i>

56:50.278 --> 56:54.146
<i>Today there's really only one question</i>

56:54.249 --> 56:56.449
<i>left to ask yourself.</i>

56:58.219 --> 57:02.255
<i>What are you going to do now?</i>
