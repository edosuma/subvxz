00:08.960 --> 00:11.440
Papa Haydn's all set with
the cake, by the way.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.249
And you have the playlist
for the reception?

00:13.320 --> 00:15.482
Yep, that's done. And the
place cards are ready.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.800
They just need to be picked up.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.571
Oh, I'll do that.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.641
No, I got it.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.210
Wow. You're doing
all that?

00:21.280 --> 00:22.850
Full-service
maid of honor.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.644
There'd be no wedding
without Juliette.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.166
Wait a minute, what about the groom?
Don't you need me?

00:27.240 --> 00:28.651
Oh, for certain things.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.201
JULIETTE:
Guys have it easy.

00:30.280 --> 00:34.171
All Nick has to do is not lose
the ring and make a speech.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.810
What ring? What speech?

00:36.040 --> 00:37.326
Yeah, yeah, I got the ring.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.204
And what about the toast?

00:39.280 --> 00:40.327
It's getting there.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.323
Oh, it better be
there by Saturday.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.011
Saturday. This Saturday?

00:47.120 --> 00:48.360
Nobody gets me.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.205
Trubel, dinner!

00:50.320 --> 00:51.401
Yeah, no, we get you.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.409
Trubel, come on!
We're hungry! We wanna eat!

00:53.480 --> 00:54.481
I'll get her.

00:54.560 --> 00:55.846
No, you sit. I've got it.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.843
Hey, how's Trubel handling
all this, by the way?

00:59.920 --> 01:01.410
She seems to be
handling it well.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.807
I'm just glad I didn't find
out when I was that young.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.766
What about Juliette?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.925
How's she handling it?

01:08.320 --> 01:11.722
Well, I think most women
would have left me by now.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.287
How much do you actually
know about Trubel?

01:15.720 --> 01:17.324
Not a lot.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.129
I've been trying not to push.

01:19.520 --> 01:22.683
I just know she's had years of
people telling her that she's crazy.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.920
Sorry. Was everybody
waiting for me?

01:26.960 --> 01:28.610
We thought we would
all eat together.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.681
Oh.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.922
I gotta get used to this, too.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.009
You like spaghetti?
No.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.089
I love spaghetti.
Good.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.681
Then let's eat.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.204
Can I say something, Trubel?

01:50.800 --> 01:51.847
Uh-huh.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.604
I know I don't really
know much about you,

01:53.680 --> 01:55.648
but I'd like to say
that I think you're doing

01:55.760 --> 01:57.330
a pretty good job handling this,

01:57.400 --> 02:02.361
considering how incredibly
difficult this must have been.

02:02.520 --> 02:05.967
Well, I really didn't
expect to live this long.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.606
JULIETTE: Do you
want more?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.321
Sure.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.971
No, stay. I got it.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.402
You remember the first
time you saw a Wesen?

02:34.080 --> 02:35.161
Yeah, I remember.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.482
It was in one of the
foster homes I grew up in.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.606
I was 13 when I found
out I was a Fuchsbau.

02:43.880 --> 02:44.881
You didn't know?

02:44.960 --> 02:46.840
MONROE: You don't really
know when you're a kid.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.605
Kind of hits you later.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.924
But at least we had family to
tell us what was going on.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.561
You really didn't have anyone
to help you through this?

02:54.920 --> 02:55.921
Mmm-mmm.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.891
When did you find out?

02:58.960 --> 02:59.961
Um...

03:01.600 --> 03:04.285
There was this guy that used to
fix things around the house.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.130
He was always really
nice to me, till, uh...

03:08.680 --> 03:10.569
One day he asked me
to help him in the garage.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.965
And he grabbed me.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.684
I saw his face change.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.360
And...

03:18.560 --> 03:20.289
He pushed me down on the floor.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.929
But I was so scared
by what I saw,

03:23.000 --> 03:24.809
that I just grabbed
the first thing I could,

03:25.280 --> 03:27.647
which was a screwdriver.

03:27.920 --> 03:32.164
And really all I wanted to do was just
push him away from me, but, um...

03:34.960 --> 03:37.167
He didn't die or anything.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.724
He just... He did get off
me really fast, though.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.801
(CHUCKLING)

03:42.880 --> 03:45.804
And that was the first time I
heard anybody say, "Grimm."

03:48.840 --> 03:51.002
I told everybody what I saw.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.320
And that was the first
time they locked me up.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.486
Said I was lying.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.281
And then when I said I wasn't,
they said I had to be crazy, so...

03:59.600 --> 04:02.570
Yeah, I got pretty
used to being crazy.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.482
Until I met all you guys.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.682
I realized I wasn't alone.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.361
(CHUCKLING)

04:13.520 --> 04:14.521
Can I have that now?

04:14.600 --> 04:16.523
Yeah, sorry.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

04:16.600 --> 04:18.011
I got it.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.767
Hello?

04:20.839 --> 04:22.763
Hello? Um,
is Nick Burkhardt there?

04:22.960 --> 04:24.530
Yeah, can I tell him
who's calling?

04:24.600 --> 04:26.489
He won't know me,
but I need to talk to him.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.927
He says you won't know him,
but he needs to talk to you.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.770
This is Nick Burkhardt.
Who is this?

04:35.320 --> 04:36.367
I'm sorry to bother you.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.283
I just need to know if
you're the police detective.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.442
If there's a problem,
I need to know who you are.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.489
Yeah, there's a problem.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.370
I'm not sure it's yours.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.526
Look, you sound like you're busy.
I'll call you back.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.169
What, he didn't want
to give you his name?

04:52.240 --> 04:54.891
I get calls like that sometimes.
They get cold feet.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.210
It's probably nothing.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.810
Yeah? Oh.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.685
I know, I know.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.240
Okay. Yeah.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.001
I love you, too.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.246
I see we're on the same floor.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.161
Hey, did building maintenance come
by your room today? (ELEVATOR DINGS)

05:41.240 --> 05:42.685
I don't think so.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.761
Oh.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.447
They spent three hours
fixing the cable in mine.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.602
Hopefully you don't
have that same problem.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.811
Have a good one.

Did you find him?

06:00.120 --> 06:01.724
Yes, Dad.
And what did he say?

06:01.840 --> 06:03.808
I just wanted to
find out if it was him.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.202
You didn't tell him that I
needed to speak to him?

06:06.280 --> 06:08.044
He was at home, Dad. It
looked like he had guests.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.884
I have told you
how important this is.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.849
You've been telling
me that for two weeks.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.367
I get it, Dad.
I get it, really.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.646
No, you don't.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.802
Well, I brought you here. I
just don't think that I should

06:17.880 --> 06:20.008
be interrupting
someone we've never met.

No, don't open it.

Dad.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.930
You're being paranoid.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.646

07:27.000 --> 07:28.240
Oh, my God.
What just happened?

07:28.320 --> 07:29.360
He was trying to kill you.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.526
He was in the elevator with me!

07:30.600 --> 07:31.931
Then you were being followed.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.480
Dad, stop!
You just killed a man.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.764
We have to call the police. No!

07:37.000 --> 07:38.604
No! They won't
understand... (COUGHING)

07:39.920 --> 07:41.160
Understand what?

07:41.240 --> 07:42.685
He's a Hundjager.

Enough of this insanity!

I don't wanna hear any more
of your sick fantasies.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.404
Look what you did!
No.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.326
You need help.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.401
No, check his palm.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.170
If he's Verrat,
there's a tattoo.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.287
I'm not gonna touch him.

Oh, God.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.163
Look! Look at this, Josh.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.641
That doesn't prove anything.
It's a tattoo.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.330
It proves that he's Verrat.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.004
Verrat what, Dad?

08:06.560 --> 08:09.291
You've been talking about this for
two weeks! I still don't get it!

08:09.360 --> 08:10.964
It means that there
will be more coming!

08:11.440 --> 08:12.930
We have to get out of here.

Did I dream that?

What happened to your hand?

08:51.800 --> 08:53.802
I cut it.
I can see that.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.483
You and housekeeping
get into a disagreement?

08:57.640 --> 08:58.880
I broke a glass.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.122
I'm tired of being cooped
up in this hotel room.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.211
Yeah, well, we can't go back to my place.
It's not safe.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.845
Well, I can't stay here forever.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.490
I told you. I'm working
with the Resistance to...

09:07.560 --> 09:09.369
Screw the Resistance. They're
the reason I'm in this mess.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.408
Look, if you don't wanna stay here,
I'm not gonna keep you here.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.481
I'm doing the best I can,

09:12.560 --> 09:14.130
so if you want to leave,
I'm not stopping you.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.401
I'm sorry.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.887
I just wish I knew
what was going on.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.760
You know, it's hard not knowing

09:19.800 --> 09:20.881
where Viktor's even keeping her,

09:20.960 --> 09:22.962
or who he has
taking care of her or...

09:23.560 --> 09:25.085
Even if she's okay.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.210
That's a pretty bad cut.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.165
I'll be fine.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.200
You know, I could be asking you

09:42.240 --> 09:43.765
about the specifics of all this.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.524
How it happened, when it happened,
what kind of glass it was.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.329
But I don't see any reason not
to take you at your word.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.843
I was upset, okay?

09:58.880 --> 10:00.291
I was alone.

10:01.760 --> 10:06.049
But now that you're back,
I'm feeling much better.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.088
If I didn't know you better,

10:11.680 --> 10:13.842

the one who's dying here.

what time I've got left,

10:50.640 --> 10:51.721
why do you care?

that building. Pull off.

No, pull off!

entering is not that big a deal

just keep doing this.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.209
Not really.
I'm just curious.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.964
Why do you carry that
around with you?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.650
I like the way it moves.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.482
You know, different
than any other piece.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.728
Well, what about the queen?

12:22.840 --> 12:24.365
She can move any way she wants.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.726
Oh, I like the queen.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.131
She saved my life once.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.281
How?

12:29.400 --> 12:32.051
Uh, I jammed her
into a Coyotl's...

12:32.680 --> 12:34.364
Is that how you pronounce it?
Mmm-hmm.

12:34.520 --> 12:38.969
Anyway, I jammed her into a
Coyotl's neck when he attacked.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.403
We were playing chess at the
Milford State Mental Hospital.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.365
They were not
happy with me for that.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.010
Hey, how about when
I get off work today,

12:48.120 --> 12:49.690
I take you shopping for
new clothes? My treat.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.569
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.561
Why?

12:54.320 --> 12:56.402
Because I don't want
to get used to all this.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.646
Okay.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.646
Let's go shopping anyway.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.725
Be ready by 4:00.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.566
(SIGHING)

13:15.120 --> 13:17.407
ADALIND: Hello.
Oh. Sure.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.202
(CONTINUES TALKING
INDISTINCTLY)

13:30.880 --> 13:34.487
My cat is very sick, and
I'd like to see Juliette.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.971
You know, Dr. Silverton?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.003
What time does she get in today?

13:38.120 --> 13:40.080
(DOOR OPENING) WOMAN: She
should be in any minute.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.002
And coffee for two.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.206
Thank you.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.249
I just ordered some breakfast.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.683
Thought you might be
hungry after last night.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.123
Well, this is all we have left.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.651
We need to go
get some more food.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.091
That's enough for now.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.407
You need to go get Nick
Burkhardt and bring him here.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.289
Why would he come with me?

14:27.440 --> 14:29.886
He doesn't know me.
He doesn't know you.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.721
You know, I can't tell
him about the Verrat...

14:32.800 --> 14:34.086
Whatever it is you call them.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.764
He's a Grimm.
He'll understand.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.080
Well, I wish I did.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.567
Open the trunk and
get me the book on top.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.051
Dad.
Just get it!

14:41.120 --> 14:42.770
(STRAINING)
(GROANING)

14:51.840 --> 14:53.444
I don't see why
this is gonna help.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.566
(PANTING)

14:58.640 --> 15:00.005
Show him this.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.526
If he's who I think
he is, he'll come.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.006
And if he doesn't?

15:04.880 --> 15:06.086
Will you go to
the hospital then?

15:06.160 --> 15:07.446
Just show it to him.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.001
Okay.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.606
(GRUNTING) on, God.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.085
(PHONE RINGING) No, I don't
think this is the one.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.162
This is really the best
thing for indigestion.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.287
No, but my son said...

15:23.400 --> 15:26.643
I know your son recommended the
aloe cure, but this is so much...

15:26.720 --> 15:27.926
No, but please...

15:28.080 --> 15:30.082
Sorry, I have to answer this.
Oh...

15:30.160 --> 15:31.241
(SIGHING)

15:31.320 --> 15:33.288
Spice & Tea, how may I help you?

15:33.360 --> 15:34.441
(ENTRANCE BELL CHIMING)

15:34.520 --> 15:37.683
No, it's got to be
delivered on the 25th.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.091
The wedding is on the 25th.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.811
If it's delivered on the
26th, no one will be there.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.166
Need your signature.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.403
Hello, are you hearing me?
I said deliver on the 25th.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.289
The 27th doesn't help me either.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.130
You signed the wrong line.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.645
The lodge didn't get
the deposit I sent.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.762
Are you sure about this?
No! No!

15:53.840 --> 15:56.002
I'm not sure about
anything anymore!

15:56.120 --> 15:57.804
I'm sorry.
Just give me a minute.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.285
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.884
Don't worry about the deposit thing.
I'll get them another check.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.725
Monroe, what are we doing?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.206
Getting married?

16:06.280 --> 16:09.807
I woke up this morning with
just a knot in my stomach.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.684
I don't see this going well.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.280
The marriage?

16:15.360 --> 16:16.521
No, the wedding.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.729
I know we both had
this idea of the big tent,

16:21.880 --> 16:23.962
bringing everyone
together to celebrate,

16:24.040 --> 16:26.327
your family, my family, a Grimm.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.129
But I think we're crazy.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.964
I mean, why are we doing this?

16:31.040 --> 16:32.769
Because we love each other?

16:36.400 --> 16:39.244
I'm sorry.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.526
It's just all gotten

16:40.600 --> 16:41.726
so overwhelming.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.040
Honey.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.531
It's a wedding.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.843
It's supposed to be overwhelming

16:48.200 --> 16:50.567
to keep you from
doing this more than once.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.290
I just...

16:53.080 --> 16:56.050
I have this feeling something
awful is going to happen.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.364
That's the spirit.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.521
Yeah, of course, sir.
I remember Ms. Schade.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.922
She's staying at
the Hotel Deluxe.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.480
I want you to keep some eyes
on her for the next few days.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.405
Okay, how much
surveillance do you want?

17:11.480 --> 17:14.050
For now, I just want to know if
and when she leaves the hotel.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.810
I can do that.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.968
How do you want to handle
this thing with Trubel?

17:18.440 --> 17:19.851
What thing with Trubel?

17:20.440 --> 17:21.805
Witness statement.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.803
Two girls stated there was
a third girl with them

17:23.880 --> 17:26.041
when our two victims
attacked and were killed.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.167
(GRUNTING)

17:31.040 --> 17:32.326
(BOTH SOBBING)

17:32.400 --> 17:33.731
It's all right now.
It's okay.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.409
They said they only
knew her first name.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.811
Said it was Theresa.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.848
Do we think we might
have a problem here?

17:42.640 --> 17:44.051
They don't know her as Trubel.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.531
They only know her as Theresa.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.045
They don't know her last name.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.805
And they don't have any
fingerprints back-identifying her.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.321
So we're thinking we covered
her tracks pretty good.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.842
I'm thinking she covered
her tracks pretty good.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.880
That's why nobody's ever pinned
her for much of anything.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.450
That's what I was thinking, too.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.886
This case is closed.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.850
Can I see you guys for a minute?

18:16.560 --> 18:17.686
Yep?

18:17.840 --> 18:19.569
Uh, I'm sorry. I don't
mean to bother you.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.130
I'm looking for Nick Burkhardt.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.770
He's not here.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.200
Do you know where he is? I
really need to talk to him.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.441
Who are you?

18:27.520 --> 18:28.521
My name's Josh.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.171
It's about my dad.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.766
He made me drive him here all
the way from Pennsylvania.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.486
He gave me this
drawing to show Nick.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.846
Let me see it.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.208
Look, I'm sorry. This is a waste of time.
(CHUCKLING)

18:43.280 --> 18:45.760
I'll just tell him that
I tried, you know, so...

18:47.320 --> 18:48.526
Hey.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.160
Did your dad draw that?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.000
I don't know who drew it.
He's had it forever.

18:55.560 --> 18:56.971
It's a Hundjager.

18:57.560 --> 18:58.721
You know what that is?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.241
Yeah, do you?

19:01.560 --> 19:02.800
No.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.721
Does your dad?

19:05.800 --> 19:07.290
He thinks he knows what it is.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.530
Stay here, I'll call Nick.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.691
RENARD: We had
a murder last night.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.922
Holtby and Bauer caught it.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.850
But this came to my attention.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.964
NICK: Looks like Verrat.
Only different.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.804
That's Verrat Ahnenerbe.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.003
Special section D, tasked
with finding anything

19:26.080 --> 19:28.970
involving rare objects, the
occult and the supernatural.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.445
So what are they doing
in that hotel room?

19:31.560 --> 19:33.289
The room was registered
to Rolek Porter.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.644
He's been traveling
with his son, Josh.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.240
Home address is
listed in Pennsylvania.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.608
We have an APB out on the car,
a '92 Volvo station wagon.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.846
Porter have a record?

19:41.920 --> 19:44.080
None that we could find. At
least none under that name.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.686
Fingerprints have
turned up nothing.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.569
So why do we have a dead

19:47.640 --> 19:50.211
special section's Verrat
agent in his hotel room?

19:50.280 --> 19:51.281
Well, there's more.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.640
Now these are stills taken from

19:52.720 --> 19:54.400
the surveillance footage
outside the hotel.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.842
According to the hotel, that's Rolek
Porter, and that's his son, Josh.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.649
What's in the trunk?
The Holy Grail?

19:59.800 --> 20:01.920
Probably the reason the Verrat
agent was in that room.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.761
I wanna find Rolek and his son
before Holtby and Bauer do.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.126
I don't want them in the system

20:06.200 --> 20:08.009
until we know
what's in that trunk.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.889
Well, there's got to be
more than one Verrat.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.201
They never send just one.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.725
No, they don't.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.247
This was taken four minutes
after they left the hotel.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.171
Look familiar?

20:18.920 --> 20:20.331
Weston Steward.

20:21.560 --> 20:24.211
So our rogue FBI agent
is still in Portland.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.362
Yeah. I'd like to
find him, too.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.201
(BUZZING)

20:38.640 --> 20:39.926
(DOOR OPENING)

20:40.000 --> 20:41.411
Nick's not answering.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.766
Well, thanks for trying.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.285
Look, I'm sorry. I gotta
get back to my father.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.169
You said your dad
saw one of these.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.765
Yeah, he's seen a lot of things.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.560
Does he have more
drawings like this?

20:49.600 --> 20:50.761
Yeah.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.251
A whole trunk full.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.001
Look, I gotta go.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.929
You don't have a clue, do you?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
What?

20:57.040 --> 20:58.644
Does your dad
know Nick's a Grimm?

20:58.720 --> 21:00.484
Yeah, he said
something like that, but...

21:01.160 --> 21:02.571
You know what that is?

21:02.920 --> 21:04.046
I'm going with you.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.284
Hold on, why should I take you?

21:06.480 --> 21:08.164
Because right now you're
dealing with a Hundjager,

21:08.240 --> 21:09.366
and you don't know it.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.283
And I'm the only one
that can help you.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.205
Who are you?

21:16.320 --> 21:18.243
Just call me Trubel.
Let's go.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.171
Come on, let's go.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.405
(RINGBACK TONE SOUNDING)

21:37.000 --> 21:39.207
Captain, Ms. Schade just
got into a Radio Cab.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.930
Is she alone?
Yes, sir.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.126
Want me to stay with her?

21:42.240 --> 21:45.403
No. No, I want you
to call Radio Cab.

21:45.560 --> 21:46.891
Find out where
they're taking her.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.280
Will do.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.086
My dad's losing
his mind, you know.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.367
I don't know what you think
you're gonna do for him.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.240
Just tell him
you know Nick Burkhardt

22:08.320 --> 22:10.040
and that he's not
interested in any of this.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.206
Where's your dad?

22:11.320 --> 22:12.367
Inside.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.767
Are you Wesen?
What?

22:15.840 --> 22:17.080
If you're Wesen
and you try anything,

22:17.160 --> 22:18.491
I swear to God I'll kill you.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.925
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

22:20.000 --> 22:21.206
Let me go!

22:21.640 --> 22:23.165
Who's this?
Dad!

22:23.920 --> 22:25.126
Where's Nick Burkhardt?

22:27.760 --> 22:28.807
Have you seen this?

22:29.840 --> 22:31.126
It's a Hundjager.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.680
I know what it is. How
do you know what it is?

22:34.040 --> 22:37.283
I've seen the books.
You know about the books?

22:37.360 --> 22:39.283
I know a lot about them. How
do you know about them?

22:39.360 --> 22:40.521
Nick showed them to me.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.250
You know Nick Burkhardt?

22:42.560 --> 22:44.961
Yeah, I know him.
I'm staying at his house.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.089
Are you his daughter?
No.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.203
You want to talk to Nick
because he's a Grimm?

22:51.800 --> 22:52.961
So am I.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.080
And he's not.

22:57.480 --> 22:58.970
No.

Come on.

what any of this means.

I'm dying. I have got
to get this to Nick.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.482
Otherwise my son will
destroy everything in there.

you to the hospital.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.406

I don't have to
tell you anything.

No, no, you don't.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.566
I've never seen this before.

25:05.640 --> 25:08.689
No, why would you? You never give
me a chance to wear anything.

This is not your color.

in the hotel room

that was registered
to your father, Rolek.

We have a witness that he was
attacked and acted in self-defense.

That's correct.

to turn yourselves in.

to the hospital.

of weapons and Grimm books.

28:07.320 --> 28:08.651
And his son thinks he's crazy,

28:08.720 --> 28:10.245
so he has nobody to talk to...

It's kind of like me.
Except he knows who he is.

28:12.960 --> 28:16.009
And this big trunk has been in the
family for a really long time.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.730
And now that he's dying,
he wants you to have it.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.126
Okay, hold on.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.611

to see you.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.690
He drove all the way
from Pennsylvania.

28:31.760 --> 28:34.240
Oh, and he wanted me to
tell you he has a key.

I don't know.

make sure I told you.

important, like...

you there in 10 minutes.

give you something.

to me by my father.

were on their way here.

and I would pass it on.

he keeps talking about?

It's a long story. Has
to do with the Crusades

32:35.760 --> 32:37.240
and a bunch of
knights who were Grimms

32:37.280 --> 32:39.726

thought no one else should have,

in the Black Forest

that had a map

leads to where it is.

I'm sorry.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.680
Look, I'm sure you
have a lot of questions.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.968
So why don't you just do
what you have to do here

35:47.080 --> 35:48.525
and then come by my place?

35:50.680 --> 35:52.842
By the way, we've got your car.

35:52.960 --> 35:56.169
Just figured that would be a lot
easier than explaining what's in it.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.080
I'll have an officer pick
you up when you're ready.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.204
What kind of cop are you?

36:05.960 --> 36:07.610
I get asked that a lot.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.446
(CARDLOCK BEEPING)

36:46.680 --> 36:47.727
Yes, sir.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.720
RENARD: Ada/ind Schade is
somewhere in this city.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.370
I want her found.

36:51.520 --> 36:52.931
Yes, sir.
We'll get her.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.001
I can't find it.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.161
Yeah, me neither.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.681
If there's a key in here,
I have no idea where it is.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.130
But speaking of lost things, have
you seen my grandmother's vase?

37:12.320 --> 37:13.321
No.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.762
Nick, there is stuff in here I have
never seen in any of your books.

37:17.280 --> 37:20.602
You ever heard of
an "Abartige Aasfresser"?

37:21.920 --> 37:23.126
Not until now.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.725
You really see this stuff?

37:26.440 --> 37:28.010
I haven't seen this one yet.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.924
But it's all true?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.322
Some people have kind
of a monster within.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.926
And Nick can see them,
Trubel can see them,

37:36.000 --> 37:37.331
and your dad could see them.

37:37.840 --> 37:40.127
Josh, just 'cause
you can't see them now,

37:40.200 --> 37:41.611
doesn't mean you won't someday.

37:42.400 --> 37:43.925
Hit me pretty late, too.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.522
Well, at least
I'll know it's real.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.007
Sort of.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.364
I can't find this key.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.726
Have you ever seen it?

37:54.800 --> 37:56.040
No.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.529
All I know is he was
really worried about it.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.520
Wanted to get it to someone
who would understand.

38:00.560 --> 38:01.607
So where else could it be?

38:01.680 --> 38:02.681
I don't know.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.645
I don't even know
what we're looking for.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.728
Well, he didn't drive all
the way here without it,

38:06.800 --> 38:08.040
so it has to be here somewhere.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.442
When he told you about it, he
was trying to get out of bed,

38:11.520 --> 38:13.080
like he was gonna
show you where it was.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.281
JOSH: It wouldn't be
in that hospital room.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.771
He never got out of the bed.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.211
Maybe he wasn't
trying to get up.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.681
He was asking for his cane.

38:20.760 --> 38:21.761
Yeah.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.365
He's had this forever.

38:27.880 --> 38:30.611
He got it from his dad,
who got it from his dad.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.611
(NICK GRUNTING)

38:41.640 --> 38:43.244
Did I break it?
HANK: I don't think so.

38:44.480 --> 38:45.925
Can I see?

39:03.440 --> 39:04.521
Hmm.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.771
Is that a key?

39:10.720 --> 39:11.960
NICK: It is now.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.650
Nick, remember that map I showed
you at my house last year?

39:45.120 --> 39:48.408
My guess, this map of yours was
drawn in the Behaim style,

39:48.480 --> 39:51.324
which could put it squarely
in the Schwarzwald.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.970
Sorry, the Black Forest.

39:53.520 --> 39:57.445
Yeah, the one that your
great-great uncle drew.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.920
It was actually
my great-great-great

39:59.000 --> 40:00.365
grandfather on my mother's side.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.283
But the point is...

40:04.320 --> 40:06.721
We are definitely
talking Black Forest.

40:06.920 --> 40:07.967
Germany.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.963
Yeah, it all seems
to go back to Germany.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.850
Well, we're one key closer to...

40:14.280 --> 40:15.850
God knows what.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.129
I wonder if we'll ever know.

40:18.520 --> 40:20.204
I don't think I want to know.

40:22.760 --> 40:25.001
Well, at least I know
my dad wasn't crazy.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.930
Unless all of you are.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.691
(WATER BUBBLING)

41:58.600 --> 42:00.443
Nick.

42:00.760 --> 42:01.921
Honey.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.126
Baby.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.680
Baby.
