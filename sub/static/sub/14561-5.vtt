00:05.873 --> 00:07.775
*

00:13.081 --> 00:17.185
CHARLIE: Monet painted
the same image over 30 times.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.188
All of the Rouen Cathedral.

00:20.221 --> 00:23.191
And no matter how similar
they may look at first glance,

00:23.224 --> 00:25.526
each of them
was created uniquely,

00:25.559 --> 00:28.529
using different brush strokes,
different colors.

00:28.562 --> 00:32.533
And as every painting is unique,
every car's engine,

00:32.566 --> 00:35.836
through wear and tear,
tuning and usage,

00:35.869 --> 00:38.639
will create a distinctive sound,

00:38.672 --> 00:41.475
allowing us to create
an audio framework

00:41.509 --> 00:43.377
to identify the kidnapper's car,

00:43.411 --> 00:44.812
following the
acoustic signature.

00:44.845 --> 00:45.846
Now, if Flynn stays
in the same car,

00:45.879 --> 00:47.715
- we can track her.
- We're dealing

00:47.748 --> 00:49.583
with a mother who abducted
her five-year-old daughter,

00:49.617 --> 00:50.551
not a professional criminal.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.853
AMITA: Well, we have
a lot of opportunities

00:52.886 --> 00:55.189
to hear Flynn's car and match it
to the audio signature

00:55.223 --> 00:57.725
and the security footage
from the initial kidnapping.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.394
For instance, a lot
of red light cameras

01:00.428 --> 01:01.595
have an audio component,

01:01.629 --> 01:03.464
so we can cross-check
the acoustic hits

01:03.497 --> 01:05.866
with the video and try
to confirm her location.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.436
And highway checkpoint data,
the Sig Alert program,

01:08.469 --> 01:09.770
which uses speed bars
and microphones

01:09.803 --> 01:10.838
to correlate traffic patterns.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.841
Now all we have to do
is filter out

01:13.874 --> 01:16.777
L.A.'s other 11,999,999 cars.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.679
And a little bit
of luck wouldn't hurt.

01:26.154 --> 01:29.123
I didn't know Anne that well.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.825
Um, she was a mistake.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.494
I supported her
financially during

01:33.527 --> 01:36.697
the pregnancy, but after CJ
was born, she just took off.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.199
We never saw her again.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.234
And I was okay with that,
because...

01:40.268 --> 01:41.469
I had CJ.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.471
Well, she was institutionalized.

01:43.504 --> 01:44.472
That's what they tell me.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.340
- Yeah. Twice.
- But she didn't

01:46.374 --> 01:47.508
have any relationship
with your daughter?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.542
No letters, phone...?

01:48.576 --> 01:49.477
Not until she kidnapped her.

01:49.510 --> 01:52.846
Listen, that woman
is crazy and dangerous,

01:52.880 --> 01:54.748
and she has my little girl.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.584
DAVID:
Hey, Don.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.452
Charlie's acoustic thing
says her car was in Encino

01:58.486 --> 01:59.753
about an hour ago.
Gave us three

01:59.787 --> 02:00.888
side streets to check out.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.924
Okay, so, uh, check out
vacant properties in the area.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.594
Granger, we'll have addresses to
you by the time you get there.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.529
(tires screeching)

02:22.943 --> 02:24.845
COLBY:
FBI! Open up!

02:26.980 --> 02:29.917
- Clear.
- Clear!

02:41.329 --> 02:42.363
Kitchen clear.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.699
Clear.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.837
Clear.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.512
- Checking the yard.
- Yeah.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.913
Damn it.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.785
They were here.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.421
Looks like they left in a hurry.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.889
(indistinct radio chatter)

03:22.470 --> 03:24.372
(beep)

03:29.610 --> 03:30.911
We just missed 'em.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.546
Well, we're on
the right track at least.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.282
I mean, the acoustic
signature worked.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.618
If they stay in the same car,
it should work again.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.953
Well, maybe we can use
her initial trajectory

03:39.987 --> 03:41.922
from here to here to get
a direction of flight.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.824
You want me to tell the father?

03:43.857 --> 03:46.226
No. I got it.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.503
Where's he at, smoking?

03:55.536 --> 03:56.537
He took a call, then left.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.974
(elevator bell dings)

04:01.008 --> 04:02.910
Dr. Bramon!

04:05.779 --> 04:06.914
What the hell?

04:06.947 --> 04:07.715
Hey!

04:11.685 --> 04:12.886
- Hey! Hey!
- Out of the way! Move!

04:12.920 --> 04:14.021
- Move!
- Hey!

04:14.054 --> 04:15.823
(car horns honking)
Oh, whoa, whoa!

04:15.856 --> 04:17.591
- Stop! Stop!
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

04:17.625 --> 04:19.059
Hold it! Hold it!

04:19.092 --> 04:20.494
Dr. Bramon, hold on!
What's going on?!

04:23.964 --> 04:24.998
- Really?
- Whatever the problem is,

04:25.032 --> 04:26.066
man, we can handle it.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.335
Open the door.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.736
Now.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.037
(tires screeching)

04:33.374 --> 04:36.043
Guys. Guys.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.746
Before you talk to Dr. Bramon,

04:38.779 --> 04:40.781
you need to talk to me.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.595
DON:
All right, thanks.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.864
Yeah, it checks out.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.666
Gives you about 20 seconds
to explain yourself.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.568
Look, I'm sorry
we had to meet like this.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.970
We just landed from Virginia;
we had to move fast.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.071
I know we came on

05:04.104 --> 05:05.573
- kind of strong.
- You think?

05:05.606 --> 05:07.608
Bunch of private security goons
flashing muscle

05:07.641 --> 05:08.742
in front of a federal building.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.379
You have to understand
that a lot of Dr. Bramon's work

05:11.412 --> 05:14.348
with LEBENS Pharmaceuticals has
national security implications.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.483
Obviously, he's under
a lot of stress.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.984
The company just

05:17.017 --> 05:18.786
wanted to make sure
that he doesn't lose it

05:18.819 --> 05:20.488
completely and start
leaking information

05:20.521 --> 05:22.490
that's above all our pay grades.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.425
No offense, but you're
a rent-a-cop for

05:24.458 --> 05:26.059
a pharmaceutical corporation.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.895
How much kidnap recovery
experience do you guys have?

05:27.928 --> 05:29.129
- No offense?
- All right, hey, hey.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.064
- Come on.
- I don't think CJ

05:31.098 --> 05:32.633
is in any immediate danger.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.601
Anne Flynn wants money.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.602
You're in contact with her?

05:34.635 --> 05:35.969
Active negotiations.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.638
Since the girl was taken
in Virginia,

05:37.671 --> 05:39.473
Dr. Bramon brought us in
and we started talking.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.008
When Flynn bolted to California,

05:41.041 --> 05:42.710
he panicked and he called
you guys.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.677
That's exactly

05:43.711 --> 05:44.378
what he should've done
in the first place.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.079
If Flynn is looking for money,

05:46.113 --> 05:47.615
why would she bring
the kid here?

05:47.648 --> 05:48.582
Leverage.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.951
California has more liberal
custody laws.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.654
She probably figured that
she could twist Bramon's arm

05:53.687 --> 05:54.622
and have a bigger payout.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.458
Look, we're here to cooperate.

05:57.491 --> 06:01.762
Besides, we can be
a lot more help than Bramon.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.766
Carla Reed.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.000
Who's that?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.001
That's Flynn's lawyer.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.169
She won't return
our phone calls.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.439
But, uh, we're not FBI.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.778
CHARLIE: So Anne Flynn
left CJ at birth

06:17.811 --> 06:20.748
and spent time
in mental hospitals,

06:20.781 --> 06:22.750
and now she wants
to be a mother...

06:22.783 --> 06:25.786
I mean, what's,
what's driving her?

06:25.819 --> 06:29.189
Maybe her biological clock
caught up.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.924
Maybe.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.696
- You know...
- I've been thinking...

06:35.729 --> 06:37.565
About kids?

06:37.598 --> 06:38.766
About kids, yeah.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.067
I mean, you don't
propose marriage

06:40.100 --> 06:41.168
and not think about them.

06:41.201 --> 06:44.104
So, I, uh, I've done
some breakdowns

06:44.137 --> 06:45.639
of the top API for schools

06:45.673 --> 06:47.908
within a 200-mile
radius of CalSci.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.577
And maybe I've done

06:49.610 --> 06:50.811
some hot-zoning
of neighborhoods...

06:50.844 --> 06:51.879
I'm leaning towards three.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.181
Three?!

06:54.214 --> 06:56.016
Three... children?

06:56.049 --> 06:58.619
Well, I'm worried
that two might create

06:58.652 --> 06:59.953
this weird social dynamic

06:59.987 --> 07:01.822
they'd be stuck with
their entire lives.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.591
Oh, like me-me and Don?

07:03.624 --> 07:06.159
When you get married in India,
you marry the entire family.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.862
Somebody should tell Don.

07:08.896 --> 07:09.963
(chuckles)
Or maybe you guys

07:09.997 --> 07:12.232
want to volunteer at
the community center some time.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.234
I mean, we could start
you guys off with, like,

07:14.267 --> 07:15.903
a Big Brother,
Big Sister program.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.070
You can get some
hands-on experience

07:17.104 --> 07:19.507
with young people.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.008
Well...

07:21.041 --> 07:22.910
that sounds like
an interesting idea.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.745
Yeah.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.248
Yeah.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.150
You ever hear
of a biotech company

07:30.183 --> 07:31.585
called LEBENS Pharmaceuticals?

07:31.619 --> 07:33.153
You have, too.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.955
Every time you take a cough drop
or get a vaccination.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.490
Well, Trey Bramon
works for them.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.526
They sent
their private security team

07:38.559 --> 07:39.827
to help him get CJ back.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.161
I didn't know kidnap recovery

07:41.194 --> 07:43.864
was part of anyone's
benefits package.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.032
I was wondering why
a biotech company

07:45.065 --> 07:46.700
would be interested
in a kidnapping.

07:46.734 --> 07:47.935
You think there's
an underlying motive?

07:47.968 --> 07:48.769
Big corporation,

07:48.802 --> 07:50.971
government contracts,
pull in D.C.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.640
You know, we could
put together

07:52.673 --> 07:53.974
a Stochastic Opponent
Modeling Agent.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.142
You could?

07:55.175 --> 07:57.711
AMITA: SOMA was designed by
the Department of Defense

07:57.745 --> 08:01.114
to understand the motivations
and assign probabilities

08:01.148 --> 08:03.851
to the actions of terrorist
organizations like Hezbollah

08:03.884 --> 08:05.252
- and Hamas.
- It's a lot like

08:05.285 --> 08:07.521
coaches studying game tape.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.856
Take soccer for instance.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.692
A corner kick
gives the attacking team

08:11.725 --> 08:13.093
a hefty advantage.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.095
They decide the initial
variables of the play--

08:15.128 --> 08:17.097
when to kick it,
where to kick it,

08:17.130 --> 08:18.632
how to curve the ball.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.267
Now, it's up to the opposing
team's coaches

08:20.300 --> 08:21.935
to know these variables,

08:21.969 --> 08:25.105
to use them to predict the play
for their defense.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.675
Will they bend the kick
into the net

08:27.708 --> 08:31.144
or punch it out to a rushing
attacker for a head-on try?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.981
The team that studies
their opponent

08:34.014 --> 08:36.984
will be more likely
to stop the goal.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.119
That explains why every
soccer match I ever watched

08:39.152 --> 08:40.588
ended zero-zero.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.555
Yeah.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.291
Similar to coaches using
historical variables

08:44.324 --> 08:45.893
to put together a game plan,

08:45.926 --> 08:48.596
we can use past and present data
about LEBENS

08:48.629 --> 08:49.963
to reason out their goals

08:49.997 --> 08:51.799
for getting involved
in a kidnapping case.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.801
Yeah, let's just hope
it's the same as ours--

08:53.834 --> 08:55.068
getting that girl back alive.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.942
Techs will need work lights.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.244
Techs will need a HazMat suit.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.246
Flynn obviously wasn't big
on housekeeping.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.048
Or cooking.

09:08.081 --> 09:08.982
Or parenting.

09:09.016 --> 09:12.052
Hellboy II and Role Models.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.121
Neither of those are appropriate
for a five-year-old girl.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.091
They were only here three days.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.793
Hate to see what she'd do
with a year.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.361
You know, there's no landline,
no record of a cell phone.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.331
I don't know how anybody
would contact her.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.040
You all right?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.575
Every case that has kids
involved...

09:36.710 --> 09:38.846
Never get used to them.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.047
Yeah.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.054
Girl's size six.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.057
- Is that blood?
- Could be abuse.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.725
Disturbed woman takes a girl

09:51.759 --> 09:54.361
she's never known, doesn't
get the money she expects,

09:54.394 --> 09:56.964
then the FBI closes in.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.033
Or it could just be that CJ
had a bloody nose, you know.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.735
Yeah.

10:01.769 --> 10:02.836
Could be.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.677
Never actually met
Miss Flynn in person,

10:09.710 --> 10:11.144
and I don't know where she is.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.880
Or where CJ is either?

10:12.913 --> 10:14.081
Or where CJ is.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.216
According to LEBENS,
you're involved in, uh,

10:16.249 --> 10:18.385
- ransom negotiations.
- Ransom?

10:18.418 --> 10:20.053
Anne doesn't want money.
She wants her daughter.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.321
Psychological evaluations

10:21.354 --> 10:25.025
of Anne Flynn from two separate
stays at psychiatric hospitals.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.728
"Shows signs of delusion
and paranoia.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.697
"Miss Flynn insists
that Trey Bramon is intending

10:29.730 --> 10:31.732
to physically dissect
Cynthia Jane."

10:31.765 --> 10:33.967
I can't give you privileged
lawyer-client information,

10:34.001 --> 10:35.969
Agent Sinclair, but I can
tell you, without hesitation,

10:36.003 --> 10:37.671
that I would never
have taken Anne's case

10:37.705 --> 10:38.939
if I thought she was insane.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.407
How'd she find you?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.142
I specialize in
difficult custody cases.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.076
Sperm donors

10:43.110 --> 10:45.278
and, as in this case,
surrogate mothers.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.148
You're saying Flynn
was a surrogate?

10:48.181 --> 10:49.449
They didn't even tell you that?

10:49.482 --> 10:50.951
Last week,

10:50.984 --> 10:52.786
the court ruled that Anne
was a nonparent

10:52.820 --> 10:54.988
without standing to contest
Bramon's custody of CJ.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.924
You couldn't know that,
because LEBENS

10:56.957 --> 10:57.991
used the Patriot Act

10:58.025 --> 11:00.060
and a national security letter
to seal the case.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.095
Of course, with all the lies
piling up, I can understand

11:02.129 --> 11:04.197
how Bramon might fail
to mention that to the FBI.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.233
Just hold on.
So, if it's sealed

11:06.266 --> 11:09.837
and Flynn is a surrogate,
then what's your case?

11:09.870 --> 11:12.005
Bramon has no
biological claim to CJ.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.173
He's not her father.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.341
LEBENS railroaded us
out of court,

11:14.374 --> 11:15.843
and then used the government

11:15.876 --> 11:17.945
to pressure the judge
to issue a gag order.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.147
Anne Flynn is not insane.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.049
And you're being played.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.091
DAVID: According to Reed,
Anne Flynn

11:31.124 --> 11:32.860
was paid six figures
over two years,

11:32.893 --> 11:34.361
carrying CJ as a surrogate
with the understanding

11:34.394 --> 11:36.063
that Bramon would be the one
adopting her.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.966
Okay, so who are
her biological parents?

11:38.999 --> 11:40.300
Well, I'm just gonna
have to ask Bramon, huh?

11:40.333 --> 11:41.434
COLBY:
Hey, guys.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.037
The lab matched the blood
on the shirt we recovered

11:44.071 --> 11:45.472
to a woman who worked
for LEBENS.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.808
- Jordan Smith.
- All right, where is she at?

11:47.841 --> 11:48.809
That's the thing.

11:48.842 --> 11:49.977
She died over a year ago.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.079
What?

11:54.347 --> 11:57.417
COLBY: So, a little over a year
ago, Jordan Smith fell asleep

11:57.450 --> 11:59.820
at the wheel
and rolled her car six times.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.154
Her parents had to contribute

12:01.188 --> 12:04.057
DNA samples
to confirm the identity.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.995
How'd you guys get a match
so quickly?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.164
It sounds like
a lab screwup to me.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.934
COLBY: I mean, that'd be
some kind of coincidence.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.836
The lab accidentally
I.D.s the DNA

12:15.869 --> 12:18.305
of a dead LEBENS employee...
at the crime scene?

12:19.907 --> 12:22.976
You didn't tell us
Bramon isn't the father.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.414
He adopted her at birth.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.350
He's the only parent
she's ever known.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.351
Is he ready to talk?

12:31.384 --> 12:33.053
Do I have a choice?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.154
(laughs)

12:39.893 --> 12:41.161
(sighs)

12:41.194 --> 12:43.931
How do you think
a dead woman's blood figures in?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.098
I don't know.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.366
Lab's redoing the DNA test.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.068
CHARLIE: That might be
a waste of time.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.003
Why is that?

12:50.037 --> 12:52.572
You asked why LEBENS
would intervene

12:52.605 --> 12:53.807
in a simple custody case.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.175
I mean, you said it yourself--

12:55.208 --> 12:57.210
that the ultimate motivation
of any major corporation

12:57.244 --> 12:59.179
in any of its endeavors
is profit.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.513
Yeah, not much profit

13:00.547 --> 13:02.249
in kidnap recovery--
I mean, especially

13:02.282 --> 13:03.884
when you're willing
to pay the ransom.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.152
Unless it's an investment.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.287
Our SOMA system
helped us examine LEBENS

13:07.320 --> 13:09.356
and what it's famous for:
vaccinations, medicines.

13:09.389 --> 13:13.026
Ten years ago,
they got into gene therapy,

13:13.060 --> 13:15.195
and they hired
one of the top geneticists

13:15.228 --> 13:16.563
to run their program.

13:16.596 --> 13:17.865
Trey Bramon.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.332
Two years later,

13:19.366 --> 13:23.470
he made the unusual choice
of hiring Jordan Smith

13:23.503 --> 13:25.238
as one of his
research assistants.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.308
Why unusual?

13:28.341 --> 13:30.243
Research assistants
at a place like LEBENS

13:30.277 --> 13:31.444
are highly sought.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.246
Ph.D. required.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.515
Smith was studying
to be a personal chef.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.885
We found this.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.286
That's CJ.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.353
No.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.222
This... is CJ.

13:42.255 --> 13:45.893
Yeah, that first picture
is Jordan Smith

13:45.926 --> 13:48.862
in 1978, at age five.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.934
So Smith is the birth mother?

13:53.967 --> 13:58.939
With a partial DNA match, yes,
but you had a 100% DNA match.

13:58.972 --> 14:02.242
Smith's DNA, as far as we can
tell, is almost perfect.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.477
No obvious mutations
or diseases.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.678
Healthy and stable.

14:05.712 --> 14:09.582
So, why do you hire a chef
with a flawless genetic code?

14:09.616 --> 14:11.919
Well, the best answer
we could come up with

14:11.952 --> 14:14.287
is that CJ...

14:14.321 --> 14:16.256
is her clone.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.539
(knocks)

14:49.122 --> 14:50.323
MAN (quietly):
That's it, sweetheart.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.593
Come to daddy.
Come to daddy.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.528
Oh, you know you want some.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.597
Get it.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.133
Get it, get it.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.668
Oh, yeah!

15:01.701 --> 15:03.436
Uh, Professor Lazlo.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.938
(sighs)
Did you see that?

15:06.639 --> 15:09.009
That... that is how
the hydra feeds.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.311
Got to be in the top five
hydra kills

15:11.344 --> 15:12.412
I've seen all day.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.680
Only top five?

15:13.713 --> 15:15.648
Oh... you must be Charlie.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.251
Excuse me-- Professor Eppes.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.652
- I apologize.
- I like Charlie.

15:19.686 --> 15:20.653
Oh, cool.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.522
I like Laz.

15:22.555 --> 15:25.058
Okay, you can sit next to
the replicas of, uh, Dolly.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.027
She was cloned from
a mammary gland.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.228
(laughs)

15:28.261 --> 15:30.163
See, Dolly, Dolly Parton.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.398
The mamm-- you know.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.565
That's-- it's not very nice.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.666
I shouldn't say that.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.435
She's probably a nice person.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.170
What'd you want to talk
to me about?

15:37.204 --> 15:39.472
Cloning...
of a human being.

15:39.506 --> 15:40.673
Well, A, it would be miraculous.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.643
B, you would have
increased longevity.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.744
Formerly fatal diseases

15:44.777 --> 15:45.945
would be, like,
a minor inconvenience.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.615
Uh, no more dying while you wait
around for a kidney donor.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.616
Organ farming.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.551
Which is terrible.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.454
The cost of a single human clone
can be measured by thousands

15:54.487 --> 15:55.755
of failed ones,
and if you're lucky,

15:55.788 --> 15:57.590
some are stillborn,
some die after they're born.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.526
I mean,
it-it-it's completely immoral.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.529
No one's currently working
on a human cloning program.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.530
(laughs)

16:03.563 --> 16:06.299
Not, not that I know of, no.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.268
Why, do you want
to start one up?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.602
No.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.671
Oh.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.506
Human cloning is possible?

16:13.540 --> 16:15.575
Yeah, it's not science fiction,
if that's what you're asking.

16:15.608 --> 16:18.011
Human cloning has been possible
for, like, 30 years.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.146
You take an egg,

16:19.179 --> 16:22.249
you remove the nucleus,
you inject donor DNA into it,

16:22.282 --> 16:23.616
and then you implant
it into the surrogate.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.318
Then you let statistics
do the rest.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.055
- Trial and error.
- Trial and error?

16:28.088 --> 16:29.789
Sure, if you're willing
to fail hundreds,

16:29.822 --> 16:31.724
if not thousands of times
to get a viable

16:31.758 --> 16:36.096
human being,
then yes, technologically,

16:36.129 --> 16:38.331
it's... easy.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.732
But you'd have to be

16:39.766 --> 16:42.502
a pretty cold bastard
to go through with it.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.737
COLBY:
So, this is CJ's blood,

16:44.771 --> 16:46.173
found at the kidnap house.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.774
And this is the matching blood

16:47.807 --> 16:50.110
of one of your employees--
Jordan Smith.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.578
They're an exact match.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.213
We've been over this.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.182
Obviously, the lab
made a mistake.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.485
So, Smith worked directly
for you as a research assistant?

16:58.518 --> 16:59.652
I knew her, yes.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.354
Why'd you hire a cook

17:01.388 --> 17:04.424
to do a job that required
scientific expertise?

17:04.457 --> 17:07.327
And how does this
help us get CJ back?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.262
This was taken in 1978.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.667
I've never seen it before.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.506
I didn't think
to collect early photos.

17:21.774 --> 17:24.077
She was beautiful.

17:24.111 --> 17:24.811
Is CJ her clone?

17:26.146 --> 17:27.314
(laughs)

17:27.347 --> 17:28.448
Look, come on, now.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.750
LIZ: Yeah, it sounded kind of
out there to me, too.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.786
We got experts
who say it wouldn't take

17:33.820 --> 17:35.355
much forensic evidence
to establish.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.657
You're talking like this
would be a crime.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.726
COLBY: Well, cloning
may not be illegal,

17:39.759 --> 17:43.096
but the misuse
of federal funds-- that is.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.464
And how many
government contracts

17:44.497 --> 17:45.832
did you say LEBENS had?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.202
We knew we couldn't hide this.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.303
I told you.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.471
Yes.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.274
CJ is one of the first
human clones.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.875
One of the first?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.344
Maybe the very first.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.112
Others have made claims,
but nothing's verified.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.613
She's still mine.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.748
I don't think

18:01.781 --> 18:04.584
a father could be
more proud of his...

18:05.752 --> 18:06.853
I need to talk to your boss.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.461
MILLER:
Look, I get it-- you're pissed.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.763
But I wasn't authorized
to tell you about CJ.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.798
I'm sorry, but come on.

18:18.831 --> 18:19.699
What was I supposed to do?

18:19.732 --> 18:22.135
Oh, so now you're looking
for a favor?

18:22.169 --> 18:23.370
A little discretion.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.172
We're sitting on
a powder keg here.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.174
You remember Terri Schiavo
and the media circus

18:27.207 --> 18:28.475
surrounding her life support?

18:28.508 --> 18:30.577
Well, this would be
a hundred times worse.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.812
Only, it would all focus
on a five-year-old little girl.

18:32.845 --> 18:33.813
A girl.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.548
We're talking about a girl.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.549
Let's just clarify that.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.385
Not some science experiment.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.553
It's in LEBENS' best interest
to treat CJ

18:40.587 --> 18:42.555
with the greatest care
and respect,

18:42.589 --> 18:44.724
and to keep her with
the father who loves her.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.359
And the government may not

18:46.393 --> 18:48.761
have sanctioned this experiment,
but they sure as hell

18:48.795 --> 18:50.563
- don't want this getting out.
- That's a conversation

18:50.597 --> 18:52.199
that's going to happen
above both our heads.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.433
Right now, my job

18:53.466 --> 18:55.402
- is to find that kid.
- Fair enough.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.571
You know, I've been asking
around about you.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.840
And you got to wonder what
a guy with your arrest record

19:00.873 --> 19:02.475
is doing in
middle management.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.910
You can see all sides
from the middle.

19:03.943 --> 19:04.777
You ever thought about

19:04.811 --> 19:06.846
transitioning
into the private sector?

19:06.879 --> 19:08.781
You talking about working
for a corporation?

19:08.815 --> 19:10.183
(laughs)

19:10.217 --> 19:11.751
What do you do now?

19:11.784 --> 19:14.687
You take orders from some guy
who takes orders from some guy

19:14.721 --> 19:16.389
who takes orders from a senator

19:16.423 --> 19:18.258
who gets lobbied by
a corporation.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.928
Look, you could be looking
at 200K a year, plus perks.

19:21.961 --> 19:25.932
And... an opportunity
to make some real changes.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.469
It's something to think about.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.915
AMITA: She hit the 405 South
from Burbank three hours ago.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.951
I wish we could tap
into the system in real time.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.319
One more hit, and I think

19:46.353 --> 19:47.720
we can get
a probable trajectory.

19:47.754 --> 19:48.721
Famous saying goes:

19:48.755 --> 19:51.591
the constant monitoring
of a quantum subsystem

19:51.624 --> 19:53.860
drastically slows down
its dynamics.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.866
How to Cut a Cake?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.601
Uh, the question you posed
about, uh,

20:01.634 --> 20:02.835
the optimal number of children.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.971
Two kids-- one cuts the cake,

20:05.004 --> 20:06.639
one chooses the slice.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.841
You throw a third kid
into that equation,

20:08.875 --> 20:10.510
and the variables explode.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.545
I was starting to think
that the idea

20:12.579 --> 20:14.681
of three kids is a lot of work.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.648
Actually,

20:15.682 --> 20:18.418
the idea of one
is kind of freaking me out.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.719
So, you're thinking
that David's right--

20:19.752 --> 20:21.488
we need some, uh,
practical experience?

20:21.521 --> 20:23.523
Being a Big Sister
for a couple hours a week

20:23.556 --> 20:25.892
seems like a good way
to put a toe in the water.

20:25.925 --> 20:26.993
It's just a matter
of finding a couple

20:27.026 --> 20:28.027
of hours a week.
(knocking)

20:28.060 --> 20:29.729
LAZLO:
Hey, Professor Eppes,

20:29.762 --> 20:30.997
I've been thinking about--
Oh. I'm sorry.

20:31.030 --> 20:31.931
You must be
Professor Ramanujan.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.600
- I can come back.
- Oh, no, come on in.

20:33.633 --> 20:34.601
- Oh, no, it's okay. Come in.
- Oh, good.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.002
- Do you have a table?
- You can use my desk.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.604
No, this works.
This works.

20:37.637 --> 20:38.738
Look at this.
Look at this.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.840
Scam, scam, scam.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.275
Have you tested the girl yet?

20:42.309 --> 20:43.976
All right, check this out--
the Raelians.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.346
It's a cult that believes
humans were cloned from aliens.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.880
They got some heat from
France for their views

20:47.914 --> 20:50.617
on human cloning, so they,
so they, uh, moved,

20:50.650 --> 20:52.419
and they branded themselves
as a business venture

20:52.452 --> 20:53.420
in Las Vegas called Clonaid.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.421
They announced they had

20:54.454 --> 20:55.988
their first human clone--
a girl named Eve.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.024
But, of course, when it came
time for a peer review,

20:58.057 --> 20:59.025
they refused
to produce the clone.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.427
And now LEBENS?

21:00.460 --> 21:01.694
It's the same thing.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.663
Big company makes
outrageous claims,

21:03.696 --> 21:04.797
then refuses
to produce the clone--

21:04.831 --> 21:06.766
just like LEBENS and CJ.

21:06.799 --> 21:07.934
Well, so far,
they're keeping it quiet.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.670
That's interesting.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.938
Maybe it's not a scam,

21:11.971 --> 21:13.606
because it's backwards.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.708
They lost the clone, but they
don't want the publicity.

21:15.742 --> 21:16.809
The exception proves the rule.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.078
This is very exciting.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.480
I mean, to me.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.914
Look at this.

21:21.948 --> 21:22.915
It says Dr. Bramon

21:22.949 --> 21:26.453
spends over a hundred
hours a week at his lab.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.588
Well, that doesn't leave
a lot of time for CJ.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.557
No, it leaves too much time.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.559
If she's the only experimental
subject, doesn't it follow

21:32.592 --> 21:35.061
that CJ's at the lab
over a hundred hours a week

21:35.094 --> 21:35.762
being poked and prodded?

21:35.795 --> 21:36.596
Explains why she's not smiling

21:36.629 --> 21:38.631
in any of the photos
we have of her.

21:38.665 --> 21:39.966
Is this about the cake problem?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.571
What's the matter
with you mathematicians?

21:44.604 --> 21:46.506
Cake is never a problem.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.045
DAVID:
This is everything?

21:53.079 --> 21:55.014
Yeah.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.816
If you told me five years ago

21:56.849 --> 21:58.851
I'd be trying
to recover a clone...

21:58.885 --> 22:00.753
And that she'd be a little kid.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.556
You know,
it's kind of anticlimactic.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.924
It's like a new version

22:04.957 --> 22:07.059
of in vitro
fertilization, right?

22:07.093 --> 22:09.696
I mean, what happens
when this becomes mainstream?

22:09.729 --> 22:10.963
People just gonna
clone themselves

22:10.997 --> 22:12.732
and call it a do over?

22:12.765 --> 22:14.033
Well, people already do that.

22:14.066 --> 22:14.934
It's called having kids.

22:18.137 --> 22:21.040
This is a limited edition bear
given to abused children

22:21.073 --> 22:23.009
at a local shelter
that lists you

22:23.042 --> 22:25.645
as the director of operations.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.681
Maybe it was two years of
signing release forms and taking

22:28.715 --> 22:31.784
experimental fertility drugs,
but somehow Anne Flynn realized

22:31.818 --> 22:35.388
that she was carrying
a clone, didn't she?

22:35.422 --> 22:37.790
I know you lied about
not having contact with her,

22:37.824 --> 22:39.959
but I need you to tell me
where CJ is.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.994
What makes you think
I would turn against my client?

22:42.028 --> 22:43.996
Because you fight
for the underdog--

22:44.030 --> 22:45.164
abused women,

22:45.197 --> 22:46.566
fathers who lost custody

22:46.599 --> 22:47.834
just because of their gender.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.736
- And?
- And you like to win.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.003
You only take cases

22:51.037 --> 22:53.473
where you have a good shot,
like this one.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.708
Surrogate cases, you know,

22:55.742 --> 22:57.777
they're tough,
but it gets a little easier

22:57.810 --> 22:59.612
when neither parent
is biologically related.

22:59.646 --> 23:00.780
You add in cloning.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.749
But you are not going to be able

23:02.782 --> 23:04.751
to win this one just because
you know their secret.

23:04.784 --> 23:05.952
They already have you gagged.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.153
I can take them down.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.121
There are laws against
using taxpayer money

23:09.155 --> 23:10.623
for these kinds of experiments.

23:10.657 --> 23:11.458
If they recover CJ,

23:11.491 --> 23:13.493
you go back
to fighting gag orders

23:13.526 --> 23:14.894
and national security letters.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.430
Miss Reed, listen carefully.

23:17.464 --> 23:22.935
LEBENS won't be able to lie
if the FBI has CJ tested.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.103
And what about Anne?

23:24.136 --> 23:26.172
Is she still a kidnapper
in your book?

23:26.205 --> 23:27.006
(sighs)

23:27.039 --> 23:30.142
I won't make you
any promises, okay?

23:30.176 --> 23:33.079
But I know my team,
and I know my boss.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.914
We will do everything
to make sure

23:34.947 --> 23:37.917
that you, Anne
and CJ have your shot.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.687
What other choice do you have?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.555
LEBENS has armed men
looking for her.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.525
If they get there first,
we will not be able to help you.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.028
No one will.

23:49.061 --> 23:52.999
They're driving south
on the PCH.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.944
Hey, you see that?

24:04.977 --> 24:07.480
Matches.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.221
Miss Flynn?

24:15.254 --> 24:16.789
Anne?

24:16.823 --> 24:19.759
*

24:19.792 --> 24:21.193
Where's CJ?

24:21.227 --> 24:22.562
Where is she?

24:22.595 --> 24:23.830
Anne? Anne, please,

24:23.863 --> 24:24.964
look at me.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.899
Where's your daughter?

24:29.602 --> 24:31.804
You'll never get her now.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.850
*

24:58.064 --> 25:00.099
COLBY:
Miss Flynn...

25:00.132 --> 25:03.502
Anne, can you tell me
what happened to CJ?

25:10.142 --> 25:13.279
Don't you want to explain to us
why you did what you did?

25:13.312 --> 25:15.982
BRAMON:
Ten years.

25:18.217 --> 25:22.188
Ten years of work and research

25:22.221 --> 25:25.157
just... gone.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.859
She had no respect
for what I was

25:26.893 --> 25:28.327
trying to do for the human race.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.630
What he is saying is,
this comes as a terrible shock.

25:30.663 --> 25:31.931
It's not a shock!

25:31.964 --> 25:34.033
We knew this was
a distinct possibility.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.769
Flynn's behavior was erratic
at the best of times.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.805
But you got to get
so many volunteers,

25:38.838 --> 25:41.307
screening gets lax.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.246
All right, well...

25:47.279 --> 25:49.716
I'm sorry for the loss
of your daughter.

25:49.749 --> 25:52.685
There's no point in keeping up
a pretext anymore, is there?

25:54.621 --> 25:56.956
I don't cry
when I toss out a petri dish.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.892
CJ can be replaced.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.594
There's more eggs.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.130
But the years we invested.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.668
They're gone forever.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.715
I can't believe it.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.283
It's horrible.

26:24.316 --> 26:27.687
Life is fragile,
no matter what the origins are.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.923
Yeah.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.127
Have they tested
the remains yet?

26:35.161 --> 26:37.129
There's no body yet.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.898
And they combed the beaches

26:38.931 --> 26:41.000
where they found Anne Flynn,
but, you know,

26:41.033 --> 26:42.802
even if they locate her,

26:42.835 --> 26:45.672
she'd still be part of an active
murder investigation.

26:45.705 --> 26:48.107
After that, the courts decide
who gets the cadaver.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.809
It's the same question
as when she was alive.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.244
W-What, what legal status
does a clone have?

26:52.278 --> 26:54.881
And for that matter,
the surrogate mother of a clone.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.949
She never even had a shot,
did she?

26:56.983 --> 26:58.851
Wait a minute.

26:58.885 --> 27:00.820
She was looking for money--
the mother, huh?

27:00.853 --> 27:03.089
I-I don't know.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.793
Uh, my experience tells me
that people like Miller

27:06.826 --> 27:09.962
aren't usually telling us
the entire truth.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.397
Okay, so,

27:11.430 --> 27:13.766
LEBENS wanted CJ
for the amount of money

27:13.800 --> 27:15.067
that could be made
off cloning, right?

27:15.101 --> 27:17.970
And Bramon was just
looking after his legacy.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.706
Okay, I got it. I...

27:19.739 --> 27:21.808
I don't got it.
I don't got it.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.910
Either Anne Flynn wanted CJ,

27:23.943 --> 27:26.112
or she wanted the money for CJ.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.413
Killing CJ doesn't get either.

27:27.446 --> 27:30.983
Well, she isn't exactly stable.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.418
Who told you that?

27:32.451 --> 27:35.221
Miller.

27:35.254 --> 27:38.190
Who put her
in the psychiatric hospital

27:38.224 --> 27:40.192
in the first place.

27:40.226 --> 27:43.930
They 5150'd her--
involuntary psychiatric hold.

27:43.963 --> 27:46.232
They probably had one of their
own doctors sign off on it.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.267
Did she get out after 72 hours?

27:48.300 --> 27:49.836
- Both times.
- Okay.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.071
So the first time, they released
her right away, right?

27:52.104 --> 27:54.206
But the second time--
man, think about it.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.842
Those psychiatrists are
going to make damn sure

27:55.875 --> 27:57.910
she's sane
before letting her go again.

27:57.944 --> 28:01.180
She's got to be of sound mind
to get through those tests.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.750
I mean, God knows,
I wouldn't stand a chance.

28:03.783 --> 28:07.754
This completely sane woman
kidnaps her kid,

28:07.787 --> 28:10.990
runs off to California,
and then kills her.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.825
Yeah, it doesn't make sense,
does it?

28:12.859 --> 28:14.827
No.

28:14.861 --> 28:17.463
LIZ: I don't believe
she drowned her daughter.

28:17.496 --> 28:18.965
DAVID:
I don't know.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.367
200 women kill their
children every year.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.035
A fourth of all women

28:23.069 --> 28:27.039
on death row
have killed their own kids.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.474
She hired a lawyer,

28:28.507 --> 28:30.342
broke into Bramon's home
to kidnap her,

28:30.376 --> 28:31.510
ran across the country.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.544
That's a lot of effort

28:32.578 --> 28:35.281
if you're just going
to toss her in the ocean.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.150
Liz, she's been
institutionalized twice.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.454
What's going on?

28:42.488 --> 28:44.791
COLBY:
Five years ago, you gave birth

28:44.824 --> 28:46.425
to Cynthia Jane-- CJ?

28:46.458 --> 28:48.460
Is that right?

28:48.494 --> 28:49.661
I want a shot at her.

28:49.695 --> 28:52.899
COLBY: It was one week ago
that you took CJ into custody

28:52.932 --> 28:56.002
and left Virginia for
California, is that correct?

28:56.035 --> 28:58.938
Hey. Thought you were
in the box with Flynn.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.072
Yeah.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.073
Liz is taking a shot.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.375
How'd it go with Miller?

29:03.409 --> 29:05.244
Guy actually offered me a job.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.345
(chuckles)

29:06.378 --> 29:08.547
Does he know
who he's talking to?

29:08.580 --> 29:09.916
Does he know you're a lifer?

29:09.949 --> 29:12.218
Hmm. Lifer?

29:12.251 --> 29:14.821
You know, I mean,
I always thought 30 years

29:14.854 --> 29:18.524
and a condo on the side
of a mountain was all I wanted.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.027
Yeah. And now?

29:21.060 --> 29:23.095
I don't know.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.898
I look at Charlie...

29:25.932 --> 29:27.433
Getting married.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.201
He's always writing these books.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.469
I don't know.

29:30.502 --> 29:31.938
I just always
put everything off,

29:31.971 --> 29:33.205
'cause, like, a new case
or assignment...

29:33.239 --> 29:35.842
Like finding a kid
because nobody else can?

29:37.977 --> 29:38.777
Yeah.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.182
So...

29:45.251 --> 29:47.186
what was it like to kill her?

29:48.988 --> 29:52.291
I want you to remember back
to the moment she died.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.260
What was the last thing
she said?

29:54.293 --> 29:56.829
Did she ask you why
you were doing it?

29:59.031 --> 30:01.600
Did she look in your eyes

30:01.633 --> 30:04.236
before you threw
her off that cliff?

30:06.505 --> 30:08.440
She scream all the way down?

30:10.009 --> 30:12.144
Thinking about it now?

30:13.913 --> 30:16.815
What it felt like to kill CJ?

30:17.950 --> 30:19.886
Tell me.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.154
Tell me what it felt like,

30:22.188 --> 30:24.190
and I'll believe you.

30:28.594 --> 30:31.263
You can't.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.199
'Cause you didn't
kill her, Anne.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.469
Where is she?

30:37.503 --> 30:39.071
You're working with Bramon.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.009
No, we're not.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.447
(crying):
I did.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.650
I took their money.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.520
She was born...

30:54.553 --> 30:55.654
(sobs)

30:55.687 --> 30:57.656
and then I left.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.225
You came back
to fight for her.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.563
She grew inside of me.

31:04.596 --> 31:08.267
She's a part of me.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.470
And she is not going
back to that lab,

31:11.503 --> 31:14.140
because it's your turn
to play good cop.

31:14.173 --> 31:16.008
LEBENS is looking for her,

31:16.042 --> 31:19.045
and if I don't find CJ,
be damn sure they will.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.580
You can't understand.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.515
Oh, I understand.

31:23.549 --> 31:26.218
Oh, I understand
a loss so powerful

31:26.252 --> 31:29.088
that it becomes
almost irrational.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.057
I was pregnant once.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.459
Unplanned, while I was
still in college.

31:33.492 --> 31:36.895
I didn't know what to do.

31:39.031 --> 31:42.101
But I never got
to make a choice

31:42.134 --> 31:44.236
because I lost it early on.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.607
My friends congratulated me

31:48.640 --> 31:51.143
for not having my life ruined
by a baby.

31:51.177 --> 31:54.713
I stayed in bed for a week, then

31:54.746 --> 31:57.616
I transferred, and I never
talked to those friends again.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.721
I know you're not crazy, Anne.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.523
You're desperate, and so am I.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.494
CJ needs all of us right now.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.531
(sobbing)

32:21.140 --> 32:23.175
CJ's alive.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.643
She's with the lawyer.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.213
Anne was ready
to take this all the way,

32:27.246 --> 32:28.480
to go to the chair
if her daughter

32:28.514 --> 32:30.049
could disappear
into a normal family.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.451
- Okay, so, where's Reed now?
- Taking CJ up the 5.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.320
She's gonna hand her off to
Flynn's cousin at a truck stop.

32:34.353 --> 32:35.454
- Which one?
- She doesn't know.

32:35.487 --> 32:36.555
We're gonna roll.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.457
How about you call CHP,
have them put an AMBER Alert

32:38.490 --> 32:41.627
out on Reed's car, okay?

32:49.268 --> 32:51.637
CHP received
reckless driving complaints

32:51.670 --> 32:54.573
on two black SUVs
and a car matching Reed's.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.146
(metal banging,
tires screeching)

33:00.179 --> 33:01.347
They're right there.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.351
Miller's guys are trying
to run her off the road.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.486
(siren wailing)

33:07.519 --> 33:08.454
(tires screeching)

33:14.126 --> 33:15.327
(metal banging)

33:20.599 --> 33:22.168
(siren wailing)

33:22.201 --> 33:24.236
(tires screeching)

33:43.489 --> 33:45.491
(gasping)

33:47.593 --> 33:48.694
They trying to kill her?

33:49.728 --> 33:51.163
Get out the way!

34:00.506 --> 34:02.741
Pull over! Move!

34:02.774 --> 34:04.543
(grunts)

34:04.576 --> 34:06.545
(tires screeching)

34:25.264 --> 34:26.598
(metal banging)

34:50.222 --> 34:51.523
Let's go, hands up!

34:51.557 --> 34:53.859
FBI! Turn around and
get down on your knees.

34:55.794 --> 34:58.164
Hold on. Hold on!

34:58.197 --> 34:59.498
Where is she?!

34:59.531 --> 35:00.732
Where did you take her?!

35:00.766 --> 35:02.634
There were two cars!

35:02.668 --> 35:04.736
They ran me off the highway
before you got here.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.239
The other car took her,
they took CJ.

35:17.849 --> 35:21.153
CJ was in my office
watching Blue's Clues.

35:21.187 --> 35:23.355
She complained,
said the show was too baby.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.624
I called Anne's cousin
from a pay phone.

35:25.657 --> 35:26.758
You thought they were
tapping your phone?

35:26.792 --> 35:27.759
I've been in court
against LEBENS.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.195
I know how they do business.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.629
But you didn't think
they would tap

35:30.662 --> 35:31.630
her cousin's phone?

35:31.663 --> 35:34.866
Excuse me.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.536
LEBENS corporate jet just filed
a flight plan with the FAA.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.671
Left Virginia 20 minutes ago,
headed for Bakersfield.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.373
All right, then we got
about five hours

35:41.407 --> 35:42.841
before CJ's on that plane.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.517
So, the Bakersfield airport
is the anchor point.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.319
Is this what you guys do?

35:53.352 --> 35:54.420
Two to three times a week.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.288
The FBI's monitoring
this region.

35:56.322 --> 35:57.456
When do you find time to teach?

35:57.489 --> 35:58.457
I've skipped, like, four classes

35:58.490 --> 35:59.958
since I met you guys.
Oh, God,

35:59.991 --> 36:01.660
office hours are gonna
be a bitch.

36:01.693 --> 36:02.728
I think

36:02.761 --> 36:04.863
it has to be one of these.
Uh, these seven hotels

36:04.896 --> 36:06.798
within the optimal
probability ring

36:06.832 --> 36:08.467
for a centroid
spatial distribution.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.402
Yeah, you're making
sentences up now.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.471
I-I get those words separately,

36:12.504 --> 36:14.806
but I don't see how
this is gonna help us find CJ.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.409
Actually, we have
an audio recording of the SUV

36:17.443 --> 36:18.410
we're trying to find.

36:18.444 --> 36:21.280
We used it to acoustically
track the vehicle

36:21.313 --> 36:23.449
from the 5 to the 99
to downtown Bakersfield,

36:23.482 --> 36:25.817
narrowing our search parameters

36:25.851 --> 36:27.553
to a very specific
geographic profile.

36:27.586 --> 36:30.222
Minimum likelihood
due to density function.

36:30.256 --> 36:32.224
These two can be eliminated.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.759
They're nonoverlapping
optimal paths.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.761
Why are we bothering
with hotels?

36:35.794 --> 36:38.464
W-We know the airport that
she's gonna be at in, like,

36:38.497 --> 36:39.431
like, 97 minutes.

36:39.465 --> 36:40.799
She's with her legal guardian.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.234
Right, the FBI can
arrest Miller's people,

36:42.268 --> 36:43.835
but that's not gonna stop

36:43.869 --> 36:45.504
CJ and Bramon
from getting on that plane.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.806
Okay, low hit score
on the probability distribution.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.741
Well, what about us?

36:49.775 --> 36:50.742
We know what happened.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.378
We could testify or we could

36:52.411 --> 36:53.979
do something to help
Anne get CJ back.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.448
That's what we're doing now.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.484
Oh!

36:58.517 --> 37:00.519
Oh, got it.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.753
All right, only two left.

37:01.787 --> 37:02.888
Okay, in your ring of--

37:02.921 --> 37:04.290
W-What do you call it?

37:04.323 --> 37:05.657
- Redness?
- Optimal probability.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.926
Okay, so, so which,

37:07.959 --> 37:09.895
which one is it?

37:09.928 --> 37:11.263
(sighs)

37:19.070 --> 37:21.407
Less than an hour
before the plane lands.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.775
Yeah, and Bramon smokes
more than two packs a day.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.877
He'll be out before then.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.948
You okay?

37:29.981 --> 37:31.683
Sure.

37:31.717 --> 37:33.585
Guess you, uh,

37:33.619 --> 37:36.388
you have to spill your guts
to a suspect every now and then.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.557
Yeah.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.560
("Charlie Darwin"
by The Low Anthem playing)

37:41.593 --> 37:43.562
There he is.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.897
DON: So we got one of
your guys in custody

37:45.931 --> 37:47.999
for attacking Carla Reed.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.635
He acted without my approval.

37:49.668 --> 37:50.969
You didn't tell him
to kidnap CJ?

37:52.070 --> 37:54.440
DAVID:
We have three minutes.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.877
MILLER:
We are authorized agents

37:58.910 --> 38:00.646
of Cynthia Jane Bramon's
father.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.648
It was a rescue and a recovery.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.816
Possession is
nine-tenths of the law.

38:06.552 --> 38:08.820
Hope you're not going for a gun.

38:13.024 --> 38:14.760
MILLER:
The girl is safe.

38:14.793 --> 38:15.761
Your job's done.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.796
So what are we really
talking about here, Don?

38:17.829 --> 38:20.599
What do you really
want to talk about?

38:20.632 --> 38:22.834
How about your future?

38:24.570 --> 38:26.572
I'm offering you something.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.508
Better job, a better life.

38:34.613 --> 38:41.086
* Fighting for a system
built to fail... *

38:44.756 --> 38:46.725
-Hands. -Keep them
where we can see 'em.

38:46.758 --> 38:47.759
I just can't see you

38:47.793 --> 38:50.596
flying out your 30 as a GS-14.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.730
Step on the wrong shoes,

38:51.763 --> 38:54.566
and you get an involuntary
reassignment to Fairbanks.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.603
Fairbanks. Never been there.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.538
CJ?

39:01.640 --> 39:02.541
CJ?

39:04.576 --> 39:05.811
Hey, sweetie.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.446
I'm here to take you home.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.114
Away from the bad guys, okay?

39:09.147 --> 39:10.081
To your mom.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.017
Is that okay?
You want to go to your mom?

39:12.984 --> 39:16.154
I knew it. Okay.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.623
See, the private sector
offers you opportunities

39:17.656 --> 39:18.624
you haven't even thought of yet.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.128
What do you really want, Don?

39:25.697 --> 39:28.534
Couple more years
with my mom would be nice.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.003
You can't give me that, can you?

39:33.505 --> 39:35.474
But I just gave it to CJ.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.711
Hey, what are you up to?
Hey, wait a minute!

39:39.745 --> 39:41.613
(phone beeping)
What...

39:42.814 --> 39:44.115
Did you jam my phone?!

39:44.149 --> 39:45.517
Me? Nah.

39:45.551 --> 39:46.985
Although I heard
they had some kind of

39:47.018 --> 39:48.554
passive cell blocking
in there.

39:48.587 --> 39:49.988
You hear that, Marcus?

39:50.021 --> 39:51.957
Where is she?

39:51.990 --> 39:53.592
* The lords of war

39:53.625 --> 39:57.996
* Just profit from decay

40:02.100 --> 40:05.837
* And trade
their children's promise *

40:05.871 --> 40:09.441
* For the jingle

40:11.877 --> 40:15.180
* The way we trade

40:15.213 --> 40:18.617
* Our hard-earned time
for pay... *

40:21.753 --> 40:23.421
You can show him the way out.

40:24.623 --> 40:25.657
Get off me. Hey!

40:25.691 --> 40:28.594
One phone call and you'll have
to give her back.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.464
You know, the saying is

40:32.498 --> 40:34.633
possession is nine points
of the law.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.136
Anne Flynn's got them all now.

40:38.169 --> 40:39.905
Good luck with that call.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.977
(phone clatters)

40:50.115 --> 40:52.718
Great day.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.553
Do what we got to do.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.221
Hey, David tells me

40:56.254 --> 40:57.723
you're doing
the Big Brother thing.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.658
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

40:59.691 --> 41:00.792
We're so busy.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.127
Oh, he finds time.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.095
You know, I actually do, too?

41:04.129 --> 41:05.931
You're a Big Brother?

41:05.964 --> 41:06.865
You should come.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.035
All right.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.703
(bottles clinking)

41:11.737 --> 41:13.271
Ah, we did it!

41:13.304 --> 41:15.073
We did it!

41:15.106 --> 41:16.542
Ooh, what are you drinking?

41:16.575 --> 41:19.811
This is the beer of professors.

41:19.845 --> 41:23.849
So, what did you find out
about CJ's genetic makeup?

41:23.882 --> 41:26.084
Nothing.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.723
Wait, you-you confirmed
she's a clone though, right?

41:31.757 --> 41:32.858
Nope.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.860
She's gone,

41:34.893 --> 41:38.630
off with someone who doesn't
look at her as an experiment.

41:38.664 --> 41:39.831
What-- But in about
a hundred years,

41:39.865 --> 41:41.867
no one's gonna know the name
of Clone Zero.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.034
Who she was,
what she went through.

41:43.068 --> 41:44.936
- She's gonna be anonymous?
- You know,

41:44.970 --> 41:46.638
there's nothing wrong with that,
as far as I'm concerned.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.574
Are you gonna get
in big trouble for this?

41:48.607 --> 41:51.543
Well, you know,

41:51.577 --> 41:53.579
I don't think we're gonna
be seeing the word "clone"

41:53.612 --> 41:55.080
on any official reprimands

41:55.113 --> 41:57.215
anytime soon.
(chuckles)

41:57.248 --> 41:59.651
- What are they gonna do?
- But your superiors--

41:59.685 --> 42:01.653
I mean, they're not gonna be
too happy about this.

42:01.687 --> 42:02.921
There'll be fallout.

42:02.954 --> 42:03.922
(laughs)

42:03.955 --> 42:05.624
So what?

42:05.657 --> 42:07.693
It's not like I'm a lifer.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.029
You are killing me!

42:11.062 --> 42:12.931
The scientist inside of me

42:12.964 --> 42:15.266
laments the loss
of a valuable specimen, guys.

42:15.300 --> 42:18.169
Yeah, but what does
the other part of you think?

42:21.907 --> 42:25.677
He's extremely happy
that Cynthia Jane Flynn

42:25.711 --> 42:28.780
is gonna live
a relatively normal life

42:28.814 --> 42:29.881
with a loving mother.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.051
Sounds good to me.

42:33.084 --> 42:34.786
- Cheers to CJ.
- To CJ.
