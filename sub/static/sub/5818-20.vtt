00:02.277 --> 00:03.942
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.943 --> 00:05.580
I have a family, Matt.

00:05.580 --> 00:06.370
So did I.

00:06.436 --> 00:08.058
And a girlfriend and a life.

00:08.058 --> 00:08.940
And now I don't.

00:08.941 --> 00:10.332
Okay, Stef, what happened?

00:10.333 --> 00:12.931
You told Caroline you'd be
with her once things were safe,

00:12.932 --> 00:14.270
and you never showed.

00:14.408 --> 00:15.416
You broke her heart.

00:15.417 --> 00:17.162
Virginia forced Lucy Benett

00:17.164 --> 00:19.098
to seal a vault in
the Armory with magic.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.000
Our other sister Yvette was still inside

00:21.002 --> 00:22.001
when they closed it.

00:22.003 --> 00:23.635
I need to get her out.

00:23.637 --> 00:25.570
Bonnie can help me do that.

00:25.572 --> 00:26.653
I need to know if the effects

00:26.654 --> 00:28.340
of those pills can be reversed.

00:28.342 --> 00:29.841
The effects of my
blood can't be reversed.

00:30.844 --> 00:31.643
That would mean you just gave the girl

00:31.645 --> 00:33.412
you love a death sentence.

00:33.414 --> 00:35.310
She's still got a mystical connection

00:35.311 --> 00:37.715
to all those vampires who
escaped the Phoenix Stone.

00:37.717 --> 00:40.418
I would be happy to wipe
out anyone off your list

00:40.420 --> 00:42.453
in exchange for a teensy-weensy favor.

00:42.455 --> 00:43.587
And what might that be?

00:43.589 --> 00:45.723
You're on your last mortal life.

00:45.725 --> 00:47.591
What we'd like to
do is to take that life

00:47.593 --> 00:49.860
and transfer it to Bonnie.

00:49.862 --> 00:51.161
Well, the good news is

00:51.163 --> 00:53.596
she finally said yes to that deal.

00:53.598 --> 00:54.831
The not as good news is

00:54.833 --> 00:57.800
she added a few more
vampires to the list.

Dr.
Flores dial 182, please.

01:29.099 --> 01:30.598
Hi.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.134
I'm here to see a patient of
yours, Virginia St. John.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.244
And what is your
relationship to the patient?

01:36.373 --> 01:38.473
She tried to kill me.

01:40.677 --> 01:42.642
I don't have a lot of time.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.211
And I need answers.

01:44.213 --> 01:47.647
Your sister Alex is hell-bent
on having me open that vault.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.773
I need to know what's in it.

01:54.875 --> 01:56.790
Well, that's the
question everyone's been asking

01:56.792 --> 01:59.758
since 1882...

01:59.760 --> 02:02.695
when my great-grandfather
first managed to open it.

02:23.484 --> 02:25.550
Dalton...

02:25.552 --> 02:27.085
Who's there?

02:28.622 --> 02:30.355
Dalton.

02:30.357 --> 02:33.224
Show yourself.

02:37.530 --> 02:39.563
What's in there?

02:42.235 --> 02:44.324
What's in there?

02:46.139 --> 02:47.571
It's not a what.

02:47.573 --> 02:49.773
It's not a who.

02:49.775 --> 02:52.875
It's what it does to you.

02:54.412 --> 02:55.245
Shut it.

02:58.816 --> 03:01.284
I'm fine.

03:01.286 --> 03:03.186
I'm fine.

03:03.188 --> 03:04.554
Quite all right.

03:07.424 --> 03:11.059
It strips
away your compassion.

03:20.103 --> 03:22.471
It takes away your empathy,

03:22.473 --> 03:24.238
your capacity for love.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.308
Eating away at your soul,

03:27.310 --> 03:29.310
until all that remains...

03:29.312 --> 03:30.578
is darkness.

03:38.488 --> 03:41.254
My great-grandfather was only
in there a few moments.

03:41.256 --> 03:43.590
My sister Yvette

03:43.592 --> 03:47.126
has been trapped in
there for four years.

03:47.128 --> 03:48.728
And I can't imagine

03:48.730 --> 03:51.764
what she's been twisted
into in that time.

03:51.766 --> 03:55.101
No one can survive four
years sealed in a vault.

03:55.103 --> 03:57.204
I said the same thing.

03:57.206 --> 04:00.573
Except Alex can hear her,

04:00.575 --> 04:03.141
through the walls, crying
to her for help.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.578
Whatever's inside that vault,

04:05.580 --> 04:07.680
it wants out.

04:07.682 --> 04:11.584
And you have to promise me,

04:11.586 --> 04:13.785
you won't let Alex set it free.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.589
I promise.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.247
_

04:38.477 --> 04:41.612
Rayna's list is too
long to kill each one twice.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.615
Well, then we better get moving.

04:54.191 --> 04:55.658
How's it going?

04:55.660 --> 04:57.727
Finished off the ones in
Huntsville and Birmingham.

04:57.729 --> 04:59.495
Ah, good. Overachiever.

04:59.497 --> 05:01.631
Somebody taking out their aggression

05:01.633 --> 05:04.133
because Blondie left
them on the front porch?

05:04.135 --> 05:06.924
Well, Damon, you're the
authority on being hated,

05:06.925 --> 05:08.303
so why don't you tell me how
to deal with the situation.

05:08.305 --> 05:09.704
Still mad, huh?

05:09.706 --> 05:10.705
I'm not mad,

05:10.707 --> 05:12.540
I'm just tired.

05:12.542 --> 05:14.175
Who's next on my hit list?

05:14.177 --> 05:15.410
Bloodsucker from the
Age of Enlightenment.

05:15.412 --> 05:16.611
Ended up in a MMA fighter.

05:16.613 --> 05:18.747
Dropping bodies all
through the Palmetto State.

05:18.749 --> 05:20.448
Doesn't sound very enlightened.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.350
That's why I'm partnering
you up with Donovan.

05:22.352 --> 05:23.651
Matt?

05:23.653 --> 05:25.452
He wants me dead. He
released Rayna to kill me.

05:25.454 --> 05:27.621
Bit extreme, even for Donovan.

05:27.623 --> 05:29.390
Long story.

05:29.392 --> 05:31.625
I don't have time for
a short story, Stefan.

05:31.627 --> 05:33.394
Listen, you two figure
out your differences

05:33.396 --> 05:35.061
while killing this MMA fighter.

05:36.195 --> 05:38.131
Oh, I guess I don't really
have much of a choice, do I?

05:38.133 --> 05:39.466
Stefan,

05:39.468 --> 05:40.600
answering your question

05:40.602 --> 05:42.535
about how to deal with being hated,

05:42.537 --> 05:44.437
three little words: Just don't care.

05:44.439 --> 05:45.772
It's funny coming from a guy

05:45.774 --> 05:48.341
working so hard to
save his friend's life.

05:48.343 --> 05:51.076
I can live with Bonnie hating me,

05:51.078 --> 05:53.078
just as long as she lives.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.079
I got to go.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.128
I'm driving.

06:11.231 --> 06:13.097
If you're looking
for the crossbow bolts,

06:13.099 --> 06:15.165
I moved them in with
the Halloween decorations.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.500
About the same time

06:16.502 --> 06:19.570
that I relocated your shotgun
from the kitchen.

06:19.572 --> 06:22.105
Thanks.

06:22.107 --> 06:24.475
Stake guns and vervain grenades

06:24.477 --> 06:25.609
are in the minivan.

06:25.611 --> 06:27.478
I called Leah over to watch the girls.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.513
They're going to make
puppets and put on a show,

06:29.515 --> 06:31.081
gonna have the time of their lives.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.081
No, you can't go.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.082
It's too dangerous.

06:33.084 --> 06:34.351
More for you than me.

06:34.353 --> 06:37.354
It would be
irresponsible if we both went.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.356
Okay, then you can stay here.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.725
Because I cannot read If
You Give a Moose a Muffin

06:41.727 --> 06:43.860
for the millionth time

06:43.862 --> 06:46.459
when I know my best
friend is in trouble.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.403
Good-bye, Desmond.

06:54.405 --> 06:57.172
See the crazy train has moved topside.

06:57.174 --> 06:58.374
Is that my shirt?

06:58.376 --> 07:00.308
Considering I'm giving you my life,

07:00.310 --> 07:03.445
I figured it qualified me for
an upgrade from the storm cellar.

07:03.447 --> 07:05.413
Personally, I would've negotiated

07:05.415 --> 07:06.547
for the penthouse suite

07:06.549 --> 07:09.450
in Paris and dinner

07:09.452 --> 07:11.519
at the best restaurant in
town where I would've ordered

07:11.521 --> 07:13.020
one of everything

07:13.022 --> 07:16.223
and had the most expensive bottle
of wine and champagne.

07:16.225 --> 07:18.125
And when all the names are in the fire,

07:18.127 --> 07:20.738
you'll have a whole
lifetime to do all of it.

07:20.739 --> 07:23.597
Guess I don't understand
what you're getting out of this.

07:23.599 --> 07:26.032
I mean, not to sound
ungrateful, but you're willing to die?

07:26.034 --> 07:26.800
For me?

07:28.036 --> 07:30.169
Just doesn't make any sense.

07:30.171 --> 07:34.067
That's because you haven't
lived seven lifetimes beyond your own.

07:35.511 --> 07:38.278
That's what I never understood
about vampires.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.046
They seek out immortality like
it's some kind of gift.

07:41.048 --> 07:43.449
Everything that mattered to me,

07:43.451 --> 07:46.585
love, family, happiness,

07:46.587 --> 07:49.187
I had all of that

07:49.189 --> 07:50.589
the first time,

07:50.591 --> 07:53.058
until it was taken away from me,

07:53.060 --> 07:56.661
and I've spent the last seven
lifetimes longing for it.

08:03.637 --> 08:07.557
I'm ready to be done on this earth.

08:09.275 --> 08:11.435
I want to see my father again.

08:13.679 --> 08:15.045
I want to know love again.

08:19.151 --> 08:22.185
That's what I get out of it.

08:22.187 --> 08:24.555
Peace.

08:31.563 --> 08:33.062
Your magic's back.

08:33.063 --> 08:35.331
The pills are out of my system.

08:35.332 --> 08:38.366
Which means the Armory's not far behind.

08:40.171 --> 08:44.013
With no traffic, we should be
in Spartanburg in under two hours.

08:52.516 --> 08:55.249
Do you want me to
find a decent radio station

08:55.251 --> 08:56.585
to cover up the silence?

08:59.055 --> 09:01.823
Or we can just talk
about your vendetta against me.

09:04.227 --> 09:06.193
Seriously, man, whatever's going on,

09:06.195 --> 09:07.561
let's just get it all out.

09:07.563 --> 09:11.064
I mean, you blackmailed
us into leaving our home.

09:11.066 --> 09:12.533
Wasn't that enough?

09:12.535 --> 09:15.043
Second best decision I ever made.

09:16.506 --> 09:19.206
Do I even want to
know what the first is?

09:24.874 --> 09:25.374
_

09:32.286 --> 09:33.486
What were you looking at?

09:33.488 --> 09:35.454
Nothing.

09:35.456 --> 09:37.456
Baseball score nothing or porn nothing?

09:37.458 --> 09:39.424
That was a pretty sketchy quick-close.

09:39.426 --> 09:41.192
It's not important.

09:41.194 --> 09:44.295
I was kidding,

09:44.297 --> 09:47.298
but now I'm kind of intrigued.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.200
Come on.

09:49.202 --> 09:50.235
Show me.

09:50.237 --> 09:51.236
Go away.

09:51.238 --> 09:52.671
Is it, like, weird and freaky?

09:52.673 --> 09:55.340
I think we've reached the
point where we can be open and honest

09:55.342 --> 09:57.074
about our browser histories.

09:57.076 --> 09:58.208
Let's see...

09:58.210 --> 09:59.209
Hey.

09:59.211 --> 10:02.346
What kind of freaky stuff you're into.

10:02.348 --> 10:03.581
Top ten ways...

10:06.586 --> 10:08.586
to propose to her.

10:10.423 --> 10:12.689
Pretty sure this
isn't gonna make the list.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.092
Yes.

10:17.462 --> 10:19.495
You haven't even given
me a chance to ask.

10:19.497 --> 10:20.797
I said "yes."

10:24.369 --> 10:25.468
Okay.

10:27.573 --> 10:29.505
Uh, all right, I guess the only surprise

10:29.507 --> 10:32.107
is if...

10:32.109 --> 10:34.505
to see if I got the size right.

10:40.150 --> 10:42.484
Are you rethinking your "yes"?

10:43.487 --> 10:45.487
First,

10:45.489 --> 10:48.222
it's a total home run.

10:48.224 --> 10:50.257
If you're trying to impress me,

10:50.259 --> 10:51.793
it worked.

10:51.795 --> 10:53.661
Second, you don't need to impress me.

10:53.663 --> 10:56.798
And I know you can't afford
this on a deputy's salary.

10:56.800 --> 11:00.768
How about on a sergeant's salary?

11:02.672 --> 11:04.204
You got the promotion?

11:04.206 --> 11:05.238
It's not official yet.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.506
But they mayor tipped me off.

11:06.508 --> 11:09.442
"Sergeant Donovan."

11:10.746 --> 11:12.278
It's got a nice ring to it, right?

11:16.218 --> 11:19.853
So does "Mrs. Sergeant Donovan."

11:27.194 --> 11:29.729
When I got home from the funeral,

11:29.731 --> 11:32.732
our wedding invitations
were sitting on the doorstep.

11:34.769 --> 11:35.768
I'm sorry.

11:35.770 --> 11:37.769
That's awful.

11:37.771 --> 11:39.771
Yeah.

11:39.773 --> 11:42.306
Everybody's sorry.

11:44.344 --> 11:46.344
I heard it was a car accident.

11:48.515 --> 11:50.782
Lost control of her truck.

11:50.784 --> 11:52.784
Hit a tree.

11:56.656 --> 12:00.124
That's the official story, anyway.

12:00.126 --> 12:03.326
But you and I both know
that's not what really happened.

12:14.605 --> 12:16.438
Ah.

12:16.440 --> 12:17.840
Hey, Bon.

12:17.842 --> 12:19.475
How was your field
trip to the nut house?

12:19.477 --> 12:20.476
Where's Enzo?

12:20.478 --> 12:22.374
He's not answering his phone.

12:23.648 --> 12:26.582
Enzo is currently chasing
down a blood enthusiast.

12:26.584 --> 12:27.583
What's wrong?

12:27.585 --> 12:29.184
My magic's back.

12:29.186 --> 12:31.486
The Armory's one locator
spell away from finding me.

12:31.488 --> 12:33.321
But they don't know that.

12:33.323 --> 12:35.523
We don't know that they don't know that.

12:35.525 --> 12:37.625
Listen, Bonnie, we are
moving on this list, okay?

12:37.627 --> 12:39.360
If dropping bodies was an Olympic sport,

12:39.362 --> 12:40.762
we'd be on a Wheaties box.

12:40.764 --> 12:43.231
Come on, you should be
used to this by now, right?

12:43.233 --> 12:46.200
I think you've died, what,
three times already?

12:49.271 --> 12:50.771
Bonnie?

12:50.773 --> 12:53.140
Yeah, here.

12:53.142 --> 12:56.243
I just want to say thank you.

12:56.245 --> 12:58.378
Well, you're welcome.

12:58.380 --> 13:00.414
I still think it was
wrong for you to abandon us,

13:00.416 --> 13:03.482
but I... I forgive you.

13:03.484 --> 13:04.751
Nope.

13:04.753 --> 13:06.753
You are not allowed to use the F word.

13:06.755 --> 13:07.821
You don't mean it.

13:07.823 --> 13:09.455
You're only saying you forgive me

13:09.457 --> 13:11.191
because you don't think
that we're gonna pull this off.

13:11.193 --> 13:14.594
And look, yeah, it's
gonna be tight, Bonnie.

13:14.596 --> 13:16.596
But we're gonna make it.

13:16.598 --> 13:18.594
You're gonna make it.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.334
So I don't accept your forgiveness,
you understand?

13:22.336 --> 13:25.270
You are gonna have to stay strong, okay?

13:25.272 --> 13:26.772
Okay.

13:26.774 --> 13:28.506
I will.

13:30.778 --> 13:32.544
You ready?

13:35.515 --> 13:37.514
This will just make you sicker.

13:37.516 --> 13:39.817
I'm not gonna let them
use me to open that vault.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.820
This will only hide your
magic for 24 hours.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.222
What about after it wears off?

13:44.224 --> 13:46.423
Then we do it again.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.793
I don't know how many
24 hours you have left.

14:19.175 --> 14:21.229
Alexandria?

14:21.231 --> 14:22.664
Shh, it's okay.

14:22.666 --> 14:23.865
I'm here.

14:23.867 --> 14:26.901
I'm-I'm here, Yvette.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.405
I'm so alone.

14:31.407 --> 14:34.241
I'll get you out soon.

14:34.243 --> 14:37.020
I promise.

14:37.021 --> 14:38.979
Now they're
getting close, they're about to...

14:38.981 --> 14:40.247
Oh, nope. Yeah, I got it.

14:40.249 --> 14:41.315
No need to elaborate.

14:41.317 --> 14:43.584
Okay. Thanks.

14:43.586 --> 14:45.552
Whew, that is five minutes of crazy

14:45.554 --> 14:47.286
I am never getting back.

14:47.288 --> 14:48.988
Okay, so this is what I got from Rayna.

14:48.990 --> 14:50.156
The girl's name is Ashlynn.

14:50.158 --> 14:51.290
They guy's name is Wyatt.

14:51.292 --> 14:54.894
The rest of her
visions are just body parts.

14:54.896 --> 14:55.750
Killing spree?

14:55.919 --> 14:59.165
No, the body parts are
Ashlynn and Wyatt's.

15:01.035 --> 15:03.469
Uh, 'cause they're having sex.

15:03.471 --> 15:06.204
Just lots and lots

15:06.206 --> 15:08.974
of intense, mind-blowing sex.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.243
Uh, Rayna was very descriptive.

15:11.245 --> 15:12.511
Huh.

15:12.513 --> 15:14.847
- Well, that's-that's good.
- Yeah.

15:14.849 --> 15:17.549
Well, hopefully the
afterglow will distract them.

15:19.029 --> 15:21.252
I mean, should I feel even
the slightest twinge

15:21.254 --> 15:22.620
of guilt about this?

15:22.622 --> 15:24.154
No, we're doing them a favor.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.123
Let 'em go out on a high note.

15:26.125 --> 15:29.360
Rip out their hearts before
they inevitably do it to each other.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.866
Uh, that's... that's pretty bleak.

15:34.868 --> 15:36.433
You okay over there?

15:36.435 --> 15:38.435
I'm fine.

15:41.172 --> 15:44.102
Look, if you want to talk
about Stefan, it's okay, all right?

15:44.236 --> 15:45.909
We don't have to
pretend that he doesn't exist.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.445
Especially now that he's showing
up at our doorstep.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.414
I didn't have
anything to say to him then.

15:50.416 --> 15:53.115
And I don't have
anything to say about him now.

15:59.990 --> 16:00.989
What?

16:00.991 --> 16:02.892
Got your voicemail four times.

16:02.894 --> 16:04.827
You know, we are
literally at a crossroads here.

16:04.829 --> 16:06.194
We could use a couple bread crumbs.

16:06.196 --> 16:08.096
Would you prefer I
left Bonnie passed out

16:08.098 --> 16:09.231
on the bathroom floor?

16:09.233 --> 16:10.832
She all right?

16:10.834 --> 16:13.468
No, she took my blood to hide herself
from any locator spells.

16:13.470 --> 16:16.103
Put her on.

16:20.276 --> 16:22.544
- Hey.
- Have you lost your mind?

16:22.546 --> 16:24.278
We spent three years hiding.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.068
I can't let them find me.

16:26.179 --> 16:28.281
What, and poisoning
yourself is a better option?

16:28.283 --> 16:29.583
You just shortened

16:29.585 --> 16:32.886
the already miniscule
window of time we have.

16:32.888 --> 16:34.020
We're so close.

16:34.022 --> 16:35.522
No, you're not.

16:35.524 --> 16:37.891
You're nowhere near done.

16:37.893 --> 16:40.360
I'm staring at a floor covered in names.

16:41.897 --> 16:43.496
And I'll kill every last one of them.

16:47.435 --> 16:48.868
Just come home.

16:48.870 --> 16:50.135
What?

16:50.137 --> 16:52.872
I don't want our last
moments to be like this.

16:52.874 --> 16:55.040
You a million miles away.

16:55.042 --> 16:58.911
Connected only by some crappy
cell phone signal.

17:02.182 --> 17:05.483
Whatever time I have left,
I want to spend it with you.

17:07.521 --> 17:09.554
Here.

17:09.556 --> 17:11.289
So just come home.

17:22.434 --> 17:24.401
I know where you are right now.

17:24.403 --> 17:27.223
I've been there for three years.

17:28.595 --> 17:31.140
You can't drink your way out of it,

17:31.143 --> 17:32.242
you can't fight your way out of it,

17:32.244 --> 17:33.844
you can't kill your way out of it.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.379
Trust me, I tried.

17:36.381 --> 17:39.516
This isn't about you.

17:39.518 --> 17:41.384
It's not about your fears.

17:41.386 --> 17:43.052
It's not about your anger.

17:43.054 --> 17:45.287
Because if this goes bad,

17:45.289 --> 17:47.191
you're gonna have nothing but time...

17:48.945 --> 17:50.359
to drown yourself in every dark emotion

17:50.361 --> 17:52.127
your brain can conjure up.

17:53.631 --> 17:55.631
Bonnie doesn't have that luxury.

17:55.633 --> 17:57.365
So go to her.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.267
I can't. I can't give up.

17:59.269 --> 18:00.536
I'm not asking you to give up.

18:00.538 --> 18:04.172
I need to make sure that she doesn't.

18:11.313 --> 18:13.313
Thanks for getting back to me.

18:13.315 --> 18:16.350
I'll admit, I was
surprised to see you on my phone sheet.

18:16.352 --> 18:18.819
Is there something I
can do for you, Damon?

18:18.821 --> 18:21.822
I have a rather lengthy
list of hell stone rejects

18:21.824 --> 18:23.824
that I need killed posthaste,

18:23.826 --> 18:26.225
and I hear you have the
resources to do it.

18:26.227 --> 18:27.493
I do.

18:27.495 --> 18:29.495
Do you have
something to offer in return?

18:29.497 --> 18:32.065
How about a key to
your creepy walk-in closet?

18:32.067 --> 18:34.067
I'm listening.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.235
You finish off that list,

18:36.237 --> 18:39.505
and I'll deliver you Bonnie Bennett.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.639
_

18:43.640 --> 18:45.844
I think Rayna's GPS is off.

18:45.846 --> 18:47.846
I don't know why a
vampire would want to hide out

18:47.848 --> 18:49.247
around so much sharp wood.

18:49.249 --> 18:51.249
You got lots of privacy.

18:51.251 --> 18:53.986
Plenty of
neighborhoods to grab somebody from.

18:53.988 --> 18:55.988
Feed at your leisure.

18:55.990 --> 18:57.856
Stash the bodies, no trace.

18:57.858 --> 19:00.391
Won't have to worry about
someone like you

19:00.393 --> 19:02.226
coming after them.

19:04.197 --> 19:06.464
Which makes me curious.

19:06.466 --> 19:08.466
You did such a good
job clearing vampires

19:08.468 --> 19:10.935
out of Mystic Falls.

19:10.937 --> 19:12.203
What makes you convinced

19:12.205 --> 19:14.205
that Penny's death wasn't
a car accident?

19:18.110 --> 19:21.211
Little things just didn't add up.

19:25.217 --> 19:28.485
There were no tire marks on the road.

19:28.487 --> 19:29.953
The impact sent a tree limb

19:29.955 --> 19:31.221
through the driver's side of the cab,

19:31.223 --> 19:33.856
yet the air bag didn't deploy.

19:33.858 --> 19:36.225
You know, everyone
said that I was obsessed

19:36.227 --> 19:38.227
and that I wouldn't let it go,

19:38.229 --> 19:41.230
but you know what it reminded me of?

19:41.232 --> 19:44.233
All the deaths that were covered
up as animal attacks.

19:44.235 --> 19:46.836
The more I dug, the less sense it made.

19:48.372 --> 19:50.439
So what did you find?

19:50.441 --> 19:52.907
That there was at least one
vampire in Mystic Falls

19:52.909 --> 19:54.909
the night Penny died.

20:01.317 --> 20:03.317
It was you.

20:14.897 --> 20:16.997
Yeah, I was there.

20:16.999 --> 20:19.566
I came back for the
anniversary of the sheriff's death.

20:19.568 --> 20:22.402
I knew it'd be a hard day for Caroline,

20:22.404 --> 20:24.571
and I thought there would
be a good chance she'd show up,

20:24.573 --> 20:27.339
and if she did, I wanted
to be there for her.

20:27.341 --> 20:29.208
But she didn't show, did she?

20:29.210 --> 20:32.045
No, she never did.

20:33.481 --> 20:37.183
Do you really think that
I would hurt Penny?

21:17.322 --> 21:18.388
You okay?

21:18.390 --> 21:21.524
Thanks.

21:27.566 --> 21:28.565
Hi, um...

21:28.567 --> 21:30.367
we're getting married this weekend

21:30.369 --> 21:31.668
and we want to get his and her tattoos.

21:32.671 --> 21:35.136
Oh, I love that.

21:35.138 --> 21:36.137
"Ash."

21:36.139 --> 21:38.306
Is that short for Ashley?

21:38.308 --> 21:39.675
Ashlynn.

21:39.677 --> 21:40.642
That's a beautiful name.

21:40.644 --> 21:42.644
Right, honey?
- Oh, yeah.

21:42.646 --> 21:43.645
Love it. Love it.

21:52.121 --> 21:52.787
Ashlynn!

21:52.789 --> 21:53.554
Sorry, babe.

21:53.556 --> 21:54.522
Help me!

21:56.058 --> 21:58.025
Poor form, Ashlynn!

21:58.027 --> 21:58.659
Shoot!

22:02.732 --> 22:04.098
Thanks.

22:14.142 --> 22:15.509
I guess we should thank you.

22:15.511 --> 22:17.277
Professor Saltzman.

22:17.279 --> 22:19.078
You're both gonna have to come with us.

22:35.329 --> 22:37.129
You came back.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.699
When have I not?

22:47.006 --> 22:49.574
Hey.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.248
Don't be sad.

22:59.485 --> 23:03.253
I have decided, I'm not gonna be sad.

23:03.255 --> 23:06.156
I'm not gonna think about all the things

23:06.158 --> 23:10.661
we never got the chance to do together.

23:10.663 --> 23:12.262
I'm gonna be happy.

23:12.264 --> 23:16.131
I'm gonna think
about all the things we...

23:16.133 --> 23:18.076
we did do together.

23:20.447 --> 23:23.229
What, like all the
excitement and adventure

23:23.230 --> 23:26.342
I provided you within the confines
of these four walls?

23:26.344 --> 23:30.480
You know,

23:30.482 --> 23:32.681
it worked for Beauty and the Beast.

23:32.683 --> 23:35.049
Please.

23:35.051 --> 23:36.785
You were never that beastly.

23:52.468 --> 23:54.401
Rayna?

23:58.240 --> 23:59.206
Rayna, what's happening?

23:59.208 --> 24:01.041
Killing.

24:15.023 --> 24:16.055
Rayna.

24:16.057 --> 24:18.525
They're killing them.

24:20.461 --> 24:22.562
Good news, brother.

24:22.564 --> 24:24.563
You can pack up your
implements of destruction

24:24.565 --> 24:26.031
and punch your time card.

24:26.033 --> 24:28.266
Every box in Rayna's
list will be checked

24:28.268 --> 24:29.535
by tonight.

24:29.537 --> 24:30.903
Well, it looks like you pulled it off.

24:30.905 --> 24:33.071
That's got to tip the
scales in your favor with Bonnie.

24:33.073 --> 24:35.140
It's a little more complicated
than that.

24:35.142 --> 24:37.208
Well, with you, it usually is.

24:37.210 --> 24:39.711
And yeah, by the
way, I'm still mad at you.

24:39.713 --> 24:41.679
You put me, quite
literally, through hell

24:41.681 --> 24:43.548
and I'm not ready to let that go yet.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.449
But don't think I'm not
noticing all the good

24:45.451 --> 24:46.617
you've been doing lately.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.686
Keep it up.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.022
It means something.

24:56.029 --> 24:57.294
Well, it looks like we're all done here.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.563
No, we're not.

25:01.466 --> 25:03.099
I don't think you meant to hurt Penny,

25:03.101 --> 25:05.334
but you know what happened to her.

25:05.336 --> 25:06.502
I couldn't make sense

25:06.504 --> 25:09.005
of my memories from
that night, and then...

25:09.007 --> 25:10.974
I checked the footage on my dash-cam.

25:25.389 --> 25:27.255
It was an accident, Matt.

25:27.257 --> 25:28.123
Penny didn't suffer.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.593
And you never saw me here.

25:30.595 --> 25:34.395
You compelled me.

25:34.397 --> 25:37.031
I'm guessing I don't need to
tell you what you said to me.

25:37.033 --> 25:40.001
No, you don't.

25:42.672 --> 25:44.405
Now you're gonna tell me the truth.

25:54.196 --> 25:57.216
Just when I thought you were
worthy of forgiveness,

25:57.218 --> 25:58.784
you do this.

25:58.786 --> 26:00.952
What'd you expect? Just
gonna let you die?

26:00.954 --> 26:03.087
I would rather that, than
be forced to open that vault.

26:03.089 --> 26:05.089
What happened to the new Bonnie?

26:05.091 --> 26:06.524
The one that's not so eager

26:06.526 --> 26:07.826
to just sacrifice herself?

26:07.828 --> 26:09.627
I don't understand, Bonnie.

26:09.629 --> 26:11.062
I have a shaman

26:11.064 --> 26:14.065
ready to make you the proud new
owner of Rayna's last life.

26:14.067 --> 26:14.943
All you have to do

26:14.944 --> 26:16.499
is just open the stupid vault for Alex,

26:16.501 --> 26:17.600
and you're well, you're done.

26:17.602 --> 26:18.947
Alex can't be trusted.

26:19.087 --> 26:20.637
Bonnie, stop being so dramatic.

26:20.639 --> 26:22.639
She just wants her sister back.

26:22.641 --> 26:24.774
Whatever is in that vault
makes people into monsters,

26:24.776 --> 26:27.044
and I'm not gonna be responsible
for letting it out.

26:27.046 --> 26:28.511
You're pretty quiet on this one.

26:28.513 --> 26:30.680
I think you had a ringside seat

26:30.682 --> 26:32.682
to Mary Louise and Nora's
final few days.

26:32.684 --> 26:34.783
You want to relive those
good times, huh?

26:34.785 --> 26:36.219
Bonnie can make her own decisions.

26:36.221 --> 26:37.519
And when she's dead,

26:37.521 --> 26:38.721
you'll be making them for her,

26:38.723 --> 26:40.789
like what dress she's
gonna be buried in.

26:40.791 --> 26:41.958
I... geez.

26:43.294 --> 26:45.594
I hit a little bit of a snag, Alex,

26:45.596 --> 26:47.439
- but if you just...
- Put her on.

26:49.933 --> 26:50.932
It's for you.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.671
Yup.

26:56.673 --> 26:59.574
Bonnie, I know you
don't have much time left,

26:59.576 --> 27:01.843
but I'm hoping you'll reconsider

27:01.845 --> 27:03.778
now that I have
something in my possession

27:03.780 --> 27:06.714
you might be willing to fight for.

27:10.786 --> 27:11.785
Oh, my God.

27:11.787 --> 27:12.987
What?

27:12.989 --> 27:14.788
I don't believe it.

27:14.790 --> 27:17.824
What?

27:17.826 --> 27:19.659
Lapis De bello.

27:19.661 --> 27:23.230
Hmm, this was given to Charlemagne
by his first wife.

27:24.783 --> 27:26.632
Yeah, that explains
why he got a second wife.

27:26.634 --> 27:28.701
No, legend has it this
allowed him to conquer

27:28.703 --> 27:30.270
half of Western Europe.

27:30.272 --> 27:33.806
You know, I spent three
years searching for this thing.

27:33.808 --> 27:35.808
Through every tomb, every monastery
throughout Europe,

27:35.810 --> 27:36.809
I couldn't find it.

27:36.811 --> 27:38.044
I gave up.

27:38.046 --> 27:40.079
I convinced myself it didn't exist.

27:41.681 --> 27:42.848
There it is.

27:42.980 --> 27:44.983
Yeah, well, good thing we got kidnapped,

27:44.985 --> 27:46.865
'cause now it gives you
a little bit of closure.

27:48.222 --> 27:50.188
Sorry, it's... you were right.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.823
Both of us shouldn't have come.

27:51.825 --> 27:52.991
Well, think of it like this,

27:52.993 --> 27:54.559
if you didn't, I probably would've had

27:54.561 --> 27:56.661
my throat ripped out, so there's that.

27:58.034 --> 28:00.965
But this is the longest I've
ever been away from the girls.

28:00.967 --> 28:03.901
And all I want to do,
I just want to get home

28:03.903 --> 28:04.902
and hold them.

28:04.904 --> 28:07.238
Yeah, I know.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.706
Tell me that everything's gonna be fine.

28:09.708 --> 28:12.009
Everything's gonna be fine?

28:12.011 --> 28:13.544
Yeah, you want to try it again?

28:13.546 --> 28:15.611
Maybe this time where
you actually believe it?

28:15.613 --> 28:18.181
Do you know what this place is?

28:18.183 --> 28:22.152
Half of these things should've
been lost to history.

28:22.154 --> 28:23.386
Disappeared.

28:23.388 --> 28:25.521
The other half shouldn't even exist.

28:25.523 --> 28:28.825
Now, if these guys can
make all of this disappear,

28:28.827 --> 28:30.526
they're gonna have no
problem making us disappear,

28:30.528 --> 28:32.494
so when I say,
"Yeah, we're gonna be fine,"

28:32.496 --> 28:34.163
what I'm really saying
is I'm praying like hell

28:34.165 --> 28:36.031
that whatever it is they want,

28:36.033 --> 28:37.599
somebody's willing to give it to them.

28:41.772 --> 28:43.272
Matt,

28:43.274 --> 28:45.807
I know this is hard for
you, but you have to trust me.

28:45.809 --> 28:48.177
Anything I tell you will
only make it worse.

28:48.179 --> 28:51.045
How am I supposed to trust you?

28:51.047 --> 28:52.981
You were the last
person to see Penny alive.

28:59.655 --> 29:01.622
Keep you hands where I can see them.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.226
Sorry, am I doing something illegal?

29:05.228 --> 29:08.628
Depends on where those blood
bags in your trunk came from.

29:08.630 --> 29:10.597
Oh, right.

29:10.599 --> 29:12.732
No, I can explain that, I'm...

29:12.734 --> 29:14.234
A vampire.

29:14.236 --> 29:16.169
I know.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.207
Was it self-defense?

29:20.209 --> 29:21.608
Caroline didn't show up,

29:21.610 --> 29:23.642
so you needed to take
it out on someone else?

29:23.644 --> 29:25.100
If that's what you think,

29:25.101 --> 29:27.246
then maybe you should
pull the trigger, Matt.

29:27.248 --> 29:28.981
Then just tell me what happened.

29:30.885 --> 29:32.751
You don't want to know.

29:32.753 --> 29:35.087
I need to know.

29:41.194 --> 29:42.593
Please.

29:42.595 --> 29:44.162
I need...

29:44.164 --> 29:46.131
to know the truth.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.705
Remember.

29:59.945 --> 30:01.178
Penny, you copy?

30:11.823 --> 30:12.689
Penny?

30:19.230 --> 30:21.564
No.

30:21.566 --> 30:22.965
Stefan?

30:25.736 --> 30:27.703
Penny!

30:30.308 --> 30:31.673
Penny.

30:31.675 --> 30:32.907
Stefan!

30:36.012 --> 30:37.845
Hey, you-you have to drink.

30:37.847 --> 30:39.814
Come on, come on, you have to drink.

30:39.816 --> 30:41.983
Penny, come on, you
have to drink, please.

30:41.985 --> 30:44.352
Stay with me.

30:44.354 --> 30:45.587
Come on, drink.

30:51.060 --> 30:53.561
It's too late.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.166
No.

30:59.168 --> 31:01.335
Matt?

31:01.337 --> 31:03.571
I'm sorry.

31:03.573 --> 31:05.805
No.

31:05.807 --> 31:07.640
Oh, God.

31:10.178 --> 31:11.811
No.

31:12.914 --> 31:15.515
Matt.

31:16.518 --> 31:18.551
It was my fault.

31:18.553 --> 31:21.187
It's okay.

31:28.895 --> 31:30.295
Penny?

31:35.536 --> 31:36.935
I killed her.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.673
I killed her.

32:24.767 --> 32:26.900
It's done.

32:26.902 --> 32:28.802
Thank you, Bonnie.

32:28.804 --> 32:30.870
You and your friends are free to go.

32:40.247 --> 32:42.247
Uh, you do realize by forcing her hand,

32:42.249 --> 32:46.751
you've just dashed any hope
of Bonnie ever absolving you?

32:46.753 --> 32:49.353
I didn't know it took so
many words to say "thank you."

32:49.355 --> 32:51.355
Oh, don't pretend this is all in service

32:51.357 --> 32:53.858
of some altruistic
desire to save Bonnie.

32:53.860 --> 32:55.860
This was all so you
could assuage your own guilt

32:55.862 --> 32:57.328
over abandoning her.

32:59.165 --> 33:02.701
Was it selfish for me not to
want my best friend to die?

33:02.703 --> 33:04.367
You bet it was.

33:04.369 --> 33:06.336
Oh, what, do you want a round
of applause for your betrayal?

33:06.338 --> 33:09.039
Bravo. Well done.

33:09.041 --> 33:10.440
No, I don't want applause.

33:10.442 --> 33:12.743
But it'd sure be damn
nice to hear you admit

33:12.745 --> 33:15.045
you considered making the same deal.

33:15.047 --> 33:17.314
But you knew you'd lose her.

33:17.316 --> 33:20.450
But lucky for you, you have me.

33:20.452 --> 33:22.451
Because she hates me.

33:22.453 --> 33:24.721
It's humanly
impossible for her to hate me

33:24.723 --> 33:26.723
any more than she already does.

33:26.725 --> 33:28.725
So I did what you couldn't.

33:32.430 --> 33:36.699
And now she'll hate me, not you.

33:38.301 --> 33:41.103
Let's grab Caroline and
Alaric and get the hell out of here.

33:41.105 --> 33:43.371
Come on. Now! Run!

33:43.373 --> 33:45.641
Be ready for anything.

34:00.389 --> 34:02.389
Yvette!

34:07.596 --> 34:09.295
Yvette?!

34:12.067 --> 34:14.100
Alexandria.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.036
I'm here.

34:21.661 --> 34:24.243
Alexandria.

34:24.245 --> 34:25.578
Where are you?!

34:29.050 --> 34:31.483
Yvette.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.185
No.

34:37.091 --> 34:38.623
Alexandria.

34:38.625 --> 34:42.360
What have you done to my sister?!

34:48.534 --> 34:49.734
Run!

34:59.679 --> 35:01.612
Check all the exits. Go.

35:10.022 --> 35:12.122
Bonnie?

35:13.425 --> 35:15.325
What did you just do?

35:15.327 --> 35:17.560
Kept my promise.

35:17.562 --> 35:20.696
No one's getting out.

35:20.698 --> 35:22.464
Bonnie, please!

35:40.837 --> 35:42.837
Look, I just didn't
want you to be consumed

35:42.839 --> 35:45.574
by one moment in your life
that you couldn't take back.

35:48.278 --> 35:52.114
I released Rayna and helped
her kidnap Caroline

35:52.116 --> 35:54.115
to punish you for something I did.

35:54.117 --> 35:57.351
Can't blame yourself, Matt.

35:57.353 --> 35:59.620
I don't.

35:59.622 --> 36:02.089
I blame you.

36:02.091 --> 36:03.559
I may have pulled the trigger,

36:03.560 --> 36:05.292
but none of this would have happened

36:05.294 --> 36:07.294
if you hadn't come back.

36:07.296 --> 36:09.196
Why couldn't you have
just stayed away from us?

36:09.198 --> 36:10.231
I only came back...

36:10.233 --> 36:11.231
For Caroline.

36:11.233 --> 36:13.433
Yeah, I know.

36:13.435 --> 36:15.868
But it sounds like she didn't want that,

36:15.870 --> 36:18.004
so why don't you just
stay away from her too?

36:20.842 --> 36:23.843
You ruined my life, Stefan.

36:23.845 --> 36:27.847
And you ruined Penny's life too.

36:27.849 --> 36:29.948
Whose life are you gonna ruin next?

36:42.929 --> 36:45.929
It won't be long now, my darling.

36:45.931 --> 36:49.133
Damon and Rayna will take it from here.

36:49.135 --> 36:52.603
Just... hang in there.

36:54.174 --> 36:55.773
Caroline's making you

36:55.775 --> 36:58.042
her apparently famous "get well" soup.

36:59.512 --> 37:01.646
That soup is awful.

37:07.586 --> 37:11.454
Tomorrow is the first
rehearsal for the May Day pageant.

37:11.456 --> 37:13.056
I signed the girls up for Maypole duty.

37:13.058 --> 37:15.892
What are we supposed
to tell the teachers?

37:15.894 --> 37:17.627
"Sorry, Miss Patty.

37:17.629 --> 37:20.729
We missed rehearsal because we
were off slaughtering vampires."

37:20.731 --> 37:22.731
We can get in the car right now.

37:22.733 --> 37:25.000
No, not before I know that
Bonnie's gonna be okay.

37:25.002 --> 37:27.503
God only knows how many
more ways Damon can screw this up

37:27.505 --> 37:28.870
by the end of the day.

37:30.908 --> 37:32.874
Are you sure that's the only reason?

37:32.876 --> 37:34.910
Yeah. Why else would I want to stay?

37:36.146 --> 37:39.691
No, I do not want to see Stefan, okay?

37:40.095 --> 37:42.450
I just want to know. You
left things unfinished.

37:42.452 --> 37:43.851
Oh, things are finished.

37:43.853 --> 37:45.620
He finished them

37:45.622 --> 37:48.590
when he just Ashlynn'd his
way out of town three years ago.

37:48.592 --> 37:51.192
And did you see how she
just bailed on Wyatt like that?

37:51.194 --> 37:52.594
He was her partner,

37:52.596 --> 37:55.128
and then the minute
things got a little bit messy,

37:55.130 --> 37:56.630
she just ran away.

37:56.632 --> 37:58.632
I mean, do you see anything
about a disaster

37:58.634 --> 38:00.867
of a love affair like
that that needs finishing?

38:00.869 --> 38:03.470
Look, I really don't want to
talk about Ashlynn or Wyatt.

38:03.472 --> 38:05.572
Well, I'm not talking about
Wyatt and Ashlynn,

38:05.574 --> 38:08.408
I am just talking about partnership

38:08.410 --> 38:11.777
and commitment and loyalty and honesty

38:11.779 --> 38:14.146
and all those things that Stefan
just took away from me.

38:14.148 --> 38:17.650
I understand, but there
hasn't been any closure.

38:17.652 --> 38:19.118
I don't need closure.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.519
No, I do.

38:20.521 --> 38:22.622
I need closure.

38:22.624 --> 38:24.590
I don't know if you remember,

38:24.592 --> 38:26.125
but my last wedding didn't go so well.

38:26.127 --> 38:27.859
So if you think that there's a chance

38:27.861 --> 38:29.594
that you and Stefan, uh,
might find your way

38:29.596 --> 38:30.995
back together again, I'd like to know

38:30.997 --> 38:32.731
before I pick out my tie.

38:32.733 --> 38:35.133
No, 'cause I want to marry you,

38:35.135 --> 38:38.136
and I want to be your
loyal, honest, committed partner.

38:38.138 --> 38:40.171
And I want our little family to work.

38:42.542 --> 38:46.176
But I don't want it if
you'd rather be with someone else.

38:48.748 --> 38:52.483
Look, I love our little family, Ric.

38:52.485 --> 38:54.551
It's unconventional.

38:54.553 --> 38:57.154
But  I'm happy.

38:57.156 --> 39:01.024
So if this is the big conversation

39:01.026 --> 39:03.777
where we're honest about
our life together,

39:03.778 --> 39:05.561
then I think we
should talk about the fact

39:05.563 --> 39:07.563
that you're the one unfulfilled by it.

39:07.565 --> 39:09.098
What do you mean?

39:09.100 --> 39:10.099
I saw you today.

39:10.101 --> 39:11.567
In that place.

39:11.569 --> 39:13.102
We were being held captive,

39:13.104 --> 39:16.572
and all you could talk
about was some stupid necklace.

39:16.574 --> 39:19.841
It's pretty clear that
you've been just Indiana Jonesing

39:19.843 --> 39:22.577
for something like that for a while now.

39:25.516 --> 39:29.518
Look, we've been trying so
hard to have a normal life,

39:29.520 --> 39:31.853
but you know what, our
life is not normal.

39:31.855 --> 39:35.889
Our kids are witch
siphons, for God sakes.

39:35.891 --> 39:38.426
We are pretty deep in this.

39:38.428 --> 39:40.428
And if that's the way that it has to be,

39:40.430 --> 39:43.030
I want to be deep in it with you.

39:44.300 --> 39:45.766
Okay?

39:48.037 --> 39:50.037
Yeah.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.776
Well, I can't say I'm
gonna miss you, stabby-pants,

39:56.778 --> 39:59.779
but you are doing a
grande solid for Bonnie.

39:59.781 --> 40:02.315
I figure that deserves a "thank you,"

40:02.317 --> 40:05.318
even in my own twisted book.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.186
You're welcome.

40:07.188 --> 40:10.456
All right.

40:10.458 --> 40:13.091
Bonfire, check.

40:14.328 --> 40:16.328
Last descendant of the
tribe that created you...

40:16.330 --> 40:19.365
by the way, thank you for that... check.

40:19.367 --> 40:23.369
Bonnie's O-neg, check.

40:23.371 --> 40:26.137
It is a great honor to meet you, Rayna.

40:26.139 --> 40:26.918
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:26.919 --> 40:28.874
Look, we're in a bit
of a hurry here, okay?

40:28.875 --> 40:31.843
So if you can get
on with the shamaning...

40:51.263 --> 40:53.530
Hear me, Great Spirit.

40:53.532 --> 40:56.032
Hear me.

40:56.034 --> 40:59.335
We call upon you in this moment of need.

40:59.337 --> 41:02.405
One has come before you.

41:02.407 --> 41:06.241
For many lifetimes as your servant,

41:06.243 --> 41:11.246
your vengeance...

41:11.248 --> 41:14.417
let her journey end.

41:14.419 --> 41:18.219
Let another take her remaining years.

41:18.221 --> 41:21.989
Let another take up her burden.

41:22.959 --> 41:24.793
Wait, what?

41:24.795 --> 41:26.461
What does that mean?

41:27.964 --> 41:29.964
Do you think I could ever forgive you

41:29.966 --> 41:31.533
for the things you did to me?

41:33.236 --> 41:35.201
Now neither will Bonnie.

41:35.203 --> 41:38.371
When she wakes, she'll be just like me,

41:38.373 --> 41:41.924
full of hatred for you and your kind

41:42.096 --> 41:45.761
and unable to rest until
you've been wiped from this earth.

41:47.122 --> 41:47.794
Rayna.

41:48.973 --> 41:50.773
Rayna.
