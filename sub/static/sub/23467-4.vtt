FX presents Baskets.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.750
MAN: Get on with it!

00:18.018 --> 00:21.989
MRS. BASKETS: Well, what do you
think of these two, which one?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.557
I think the more expensive one.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.226
I see what you're doing.
You're trying to upsell me.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.360
-Good for you, Barb.

00:26.394 --> 00:29.263
Oh, Christine.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.399
-Hi.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.201
-Mwah.
-Hi.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.836
-Oh, hey, Joan.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.073
Oh, I'm just getting this photo
of Danielle Mana and I

00:39.107 --> 00:41.175
in the interview on TV framed.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.845
Did you happen
to see the interview?

00:44.878 --> 00:47.415
Oh, I'm sorry, my son deleted it
before I got to see it.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.783
He wanted to make room
for his UFC fight.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.685
(Maggie and Mrs. Baskets
chuckle)

00:51.719 --> 00:53.087
Joan?

00:53.121 --> 00:55.256
Oh, I don't watch television.

00:55.289 --> 00:58.126
Oh, I don't know how you do it
because I love television.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.761
I've got to have that thing
on 24/7.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.130
I love the patter.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.897
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh, God.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.066
What are you ladies doing here?

01:06.100 --> 01:07.568
Oh, just to get this framed.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.570
We went
to "Jazz Under The Stars"

01:09.603 --> 01:10.738
at the California Living Museum.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.541
-Yeah. -The museum features
plants and animals

01:13.574 --> 01:16.210
-centric to Kern County.

01:16.244 --> 01:19.447
Yeah. Joan's a docent there,
that's the reason we got comps.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.815
Yeah, she sure is.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.651
DALE:
Mother.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.052
Mom, are you okay?

01:25.085 --> 01:26.554
Yeah.

01:26.587 --> 01:30.491
-Uh, Backyard Banking.
-Yeah.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.060
Backyard Banking
from the Bank of Bakersfield.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.297
So, let's pass these out.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.632
These are our check cards.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.634
I need you to sign
the back of these,

01:40.668 --> 01:43.103
if you don't mind,
Mom and Chip.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.973
-Oh, it's, uh... oh,
it's my own credit card. -Yeah.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.841
You just make a purchase
and ding, ding, ding,

01:47.875 --> 01:49.310
it shows up right there.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.312
Banking's gone digital
in the last few months.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.148
-No, you don't get a card.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.583
I'd give Linda a card
before I gave you one.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.754
Okay, are we, are we done
with the

02:00.788 --> 02:02.823
I wanted to start the clown
portion of the meeting.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.794
Uh, I was thinking about doing
kind of a... a German piece

02:06.827 --> 02:08.329
with French clowns,

02:08.362 --> 02:10.964
but with a real
San Joaquin Valley earthiness,

02:10.998 --> 02:12.800
uh, for a real
American experience.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.804
The only part of that speech
I liked was the word "American."

02:16.837 --> 02:18.672
So, I don't know
what you were talking about.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.808
Uh, boys, can we put a pin
in this?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.843
I've got a great idea.

02:22.876 --> 02:26.514
You know, it's a special night
at the rodeo.

02:26.547 --> 02:32.152
Like "Jazz Under The Stars,"
but better, fancier, jazzier.

02:32.186 --> 02:35.556
No cowboys. No bulls.

02:35.589 --> 02:36.890
:
Just class.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.326
Well, that's fantastic,
Christine.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.493
I'd love to be there.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.730
Oh, you can. I'll fly you out.

02:42.763 --> 02:46.033
-Mm, no. I can fly myself.
-Oh, Ken,

02:46.066 --> 02:48.636
what's the use
of having a business card

02:48.669 --> 02:51.372
if I can't put some expenses
on it

02:51.405 --> 02:53.073
Okay, well,

02:53.106 --> 02:55.676
let's make this
a real business expense.

02:55.709 --> 02:59.146
Do you need any, uh, carpeting
for your special night?

02:59.179 --> 03:01.915
MRS. BASKETS:
What about a red carpet?

03:01.949 --> 03:03.083
Oh, this light is so long.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.219
KEN:
Say what?

03:05.253 --> 03:08.522
MRS. BASKETS: Oh, this light
is so long, Ken.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.858
Geez Louise.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.393
So what kind of night is this,
Christine?

03:12.426 --> 03:13.727
What's fancier

03:13.761 --> 03:17.331
-Hmm.

03:17.365 --> 03:22.236
"Easy Listening
Under the Rodeo Moon."

03:24.372 --> 03:28.409
No offense, Ken,
but that sounds like a snore.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.278
Oh! I got it!

03:30.311 --> 03:31.679
Opera!

03:33.647 --> 03:36.584
A night of opera at the rodeo!

03:36.617 --> 03:38.852
Under The Stars.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.191
-Yeah, you mean like a soap
opera? -MRS. BASKETS: No, opera.

03:44.224 --> 03:48.195
Pavarotti?
-Opera. Not Oprah.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.398
No, Oprah's
with Weight Watchers now.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.300
-Oh.
-MRS. BASKETS: Mm-hmm. Here.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.769
Listen to this.
It's just beautiful.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.238
("Libiamo ne' lieti calici"
by Giuseppe Verdi playing)

04:02.676 --> 04:05.313
Imagine that,
people listening to the music,

04:05.346 --> 04:06.880
losing themselves.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.217
Nobody's gonna appreciate that
in Bakersfield.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.653
Well, there's lots
of sophisticated people here.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.221
Well, the ilk
that I run around with

04:14.254 --> 04:15.889
will certainly not
appreciate it.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.125
The elk you're
running around with?

04:18.158 --> 04:20.060
Not "elk," Mom, "ilk."

04:20.093 --> 04:22.162
It's a word of the day
that I learned.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.664
Well, what do you think, Chip?

04:23.697 --> 04:26.934
Yeah, I could, uh,
I could make sense of this.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.802
I still want to work
with the French clowns.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.338
-Mm-hmm.
-You know.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.973
Still also with the
San Joaquin Valley earthiness.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.908
I want to include that.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.677
A what?

04:36.710 --> 04:40.247
Oh, a-a San Joaquin
earthy thing.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.115
-It sounds fantastic.
-DALE: Yeah.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.784
MRS. BASKETS:
Well, it's settled.

04:43.817 --> 04:48.789
"A Night at the Opera
at the Rodeo Under the Stars."

04:48.822 --> 04:51.425
Hi, I'm throwing an opera

04:51.459 --> 04:54.428
and I need the classiest tables
you have.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.197
What's a pillar go for?
Like, a ten-foot pillar.

04:57.230 --> 05:01.268
Expiration? Zero, eight, 21.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.704
You know, I want opera,
like, you know, high notes,

05:03.737 --> 05:05.706
low notes, middle notes.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.008
Hey, you know, the notes
that can break a glass

05:08.041 --> 05:09.276
when you're holding it?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.879
I'm putting on an opera
at a rodeo.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.214
Can you believe it?

05:14.247 --> 05:16.784
Mom, I invited some clowns
I know from France

05:16.817 --> 05:19.453
who said they will do it
for free.

05:19.487 --> 05:22.155
But it might be expensive
because of the plane tickets.

05:22.189 --> 05:25.158
Well, put it on the credit card.
It's a business expense.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.494
Yeah, I did already. Okay.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.995
MRS. BASKETS:
Hello, Popeyes?

05:28.028 --> 05:31.064
Could I get 18 buckets
of shrimp?

05:31.098 --> 05:33.901
-I will bid...
-Hi.

05:33.934 --> 05:37.971
I am here to present you
with "A Night at the Opera."

05:38.005 --> 05:39.139
Oh, I love opera.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.475
-At the rodeo.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.477
-MRS. BASKETS: That's right.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.880
-We're gonna have a real
opera singer. -Oh, my gosh.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.082
I've got to go, I got
a million things to do.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.385
: Oh, my God.
-Look at this.

05:51.419 --> 05:54.154
-My God. -Lobster.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.190
Password.
"WhatTheDale."

05:57.224 --> 05:59.660
"Over limit warning"?

05:59.693 --> 06:03.196
$761 for
"miscellaneous staging"?

06:03.230 --> 06:06.166
$6,000 for airline tickets
from France?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.334
Oh, God, that's got
to be cancelled.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.069
No, tha-- ow!

06:09.102 --> 06:13.674
Oh, hey, Linda?
Linda, Linda, Linda, Linda,

06:13.707 --> 06:16.410
come on, come on,
come on, on, on...

06:16.444 --> 06:18.178
-Ah.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.248
Sweetie, right there
on my L4 and L5.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.617
-That's the stuff, ah.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.587
Oh. That feels better.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.392
FEMALE VOICE: The white zone
is for immediate loading

06:32.426 --> 06:34.595
-and unloading of passengers
only.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.929
MRS. BASKETS:
Hey, stranger.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.931
You need a ride?

06:37.965 --> 06:40.768
Well, if you could drop me
by my girlfriend's house,

06:40.801 --> 06:41.969
-that'd be great.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.471
Get in, these guys'll
give you a ticket

06:43.504 --> 06:45.372
if you slow down out here.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.441
-Oh.
-Mwah.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.209
So nice to see you.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.078
Hey, I'm gonna pick up
the French clowns.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.546
They should be here pretty soon.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.716
Thought I was gonna have you
all to myself.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.818
Oh, Ken, I've got
a million things to do.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.386
Got to pick up
the velvet ropes.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.655
I got to get
these French clowns.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.957
Hey, are you guys French clowns?

07:03.991 --> 07:06.093
I guess not.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.628
Did you see anybody in there

07:07.661 --> 07:09.296
that had a funny nose
or big feet?

07:09.329 --> 07:10.397
Maybe they're still inside.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.899
You want me to go and check?

07:11.932 --> 07:14.835
You're so nice.
-Oh, stop.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.971
You're already making my
opening night jitters go away.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.274
DALE:
Hello?

07:21.308 --> 07:22.976
-DALE: Hello, Mother.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.245
What time do the French clowns
get in?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.947
Yeah, no,
I cancelled those flights.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.116
-It was too much money, Mom.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.652
I promised people French clowns.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.153
You're spending too much money.
I mean,

07:33.186 --> 07:34.988
who's spending the--
all the money on this lumber?

07:35.022 --> 07:36.456
Somebody called about lumber?

07:36.490 --> 07:37.758
Well, that's for the stage.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.760
I can't have the opera singers
singing in dirt.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.361
That's tacky.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.931
Oh. Have my pillars arrived?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.032
The pillars?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.134
Like, to sleep on?

07:47.167 --> 07:48.702
Oh, hold on.
I'm getting another call.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.037
Oh, it's Chip.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.705
Hold on, Dale, it's Chip.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.607
-Hi, Chip.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.543
There's an opera singer here
to see you.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.344
-Oh, good. -And he needs
to see you right away.

07:57.377 --> 07:58.812
He said to get here A.S.A.P.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.113
Those are his words, not mine.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.214
I wouldn't say that.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.683
-I say "ASAP."
-Oh, God.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.351
I'm on my way.

08:06.486 --> 08:10.023
Damn it, I always miss
this light.

08:10.057 --> 08:13.060
:
Oh, God, I'm gonna be late.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.201
:
Oh! Wow.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.243
Dale canceled the French clowns?

08:30.277 --> 08:32.012
Dale said we were
going over budget.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.915
But don't worry-- you can work
with their replacement.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.349
This is Sleepy.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.385
He's a sign spinner.

08:38.418 --> 08:39.687
What?

08:39.720 --> 08:40.754
Chip, he's very agile.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.355
You should see the flips
he does.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.857
-Yep.

08:43.891 --> 08:46.894
-Do you even know
the art of clowning? -Yep.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.663
-Nope.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.231
MRS. BASKETS:
Just work with him, Chip.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.900
-Okay, Mom.
-It'll be great.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.568
-Fine.
-Ah.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.003
It's mesmerizing.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.039
My boyfriend is gonna be
so excited to see...

08:59.072 --> 09:00.507
Oh, Ken!

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542
I left you at the airport.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.344
MRS. BASKETS:
I have no excuse.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.848
I'm so, so stupid.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.917
I'm just a ditz.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.519
One more minute, and I'd have
been on my way back to Denver.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.023
I'm sorry. There's just so much
to do on opening night...

09:16.056 --> 09:18.959
Oh, my God, I got to get
the velvet ropes.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.864
Thank you, Ken, for helping me
with the ropes.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.799
No problem.
I think that's the last one.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.234
Oh, no, there's lots more.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.568
-No.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.237
-That's not it.
-Let me go ask somebody.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.641
Hi, Chip. How's Sleepy?

09:33.674 --> 09:35.542
CHIP: Well, he wouldn't have
been my first choice,

09:35.575 --> 09:37.544
but I guess I don't have
a say in the matter.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.246
We have a bigger problem.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.148
Your tables and chairs
have arrived,

09:41.181 --> 09:44.217
and your chairs are too high
and the tables are too low.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.552
It looks stupid.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.155
Galdarnit. I'll be right there.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.762
Dale, I'm just pulling in
to the rodeo.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.765
Can you come and help me unload
those VIP ropes?

09:57.798 --> 09:58.966
DALE:
No, I cannot, Mama.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.167
My back is killing me.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.302
-Get Ken to help.
-Ken!

10:07.174 --> 10:09.009
MRS. BASKETS:
Hey, listen.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.312
You sit tight, and I'll get
someone to get all this stuff.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.349
Okay.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.085
-CHIP: Hey, Mom.
-Oh, Chip.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.987
Sleepy and I wanted to,
uh, show you...

10:20.020 --> 10:21.989
Hey, the photographer!

10:22.022 --> 10:23.857
-CHIP: Yeah.
-Oh, hey!

10:23.891 --> 10:25.325
Uh, Sleepy and I want
to show you our new act.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.426
I can't wait.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.162
Oh, I love pictures, don't you?

10:29.196 --> 10:30.664
-Yeah.
-Do a funny one with me.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.001
-I love it.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.936
-Yes. Let's see the head act.
-Okay.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.204
-Come on.
-I can't wait.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.873
MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, what a day.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.419
Do the accordion thing.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.623
It's getting better.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.891
That's it?

10:57.925 --> 10:59.459
What is this?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.461
I'm kind of going for
a Pagliacci-type thing,

11:01.494 --> 11:03.731
uh, mixed in with
a San Joaquin Valley earthiness.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.533
What?

11:06.566 --> 11:07.868
I like the sign spinning.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.704
W-Where's the sign spinning,
Sleazy?

11:10.738 --> 11:13.140
Well, this guy told me we're not
corporate monkeys anymore.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.341
CHIP:
I...

11:14.374 --> 11:16.643
thought we were a team, Sneezy.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.478
And by team,
I'm your superior.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.813
Aren't I Sneezy's superior, Mom?

11:21.048 --> 11:22.482
Here's what we're gonna do.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.918
You're gonna be
out on stage, Sleazy.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.854
-Sneezy.
-That's what I said.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.656
You're gonna be with the opera
singers, spinning your sign.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.059
Chip, you're gonna be out
in front of the house,

11:32.092 --> 11:35.195
welcoming our customers,
checking their tickets.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.496
Do you have any balloon animals?
You know, maybe

11:36.529 --> 11:37.397
tie a balloon animal
or something?

11:37.430 --> 11:38.531
Front of house?

11:38.565 --> 11:39.933
I'm not a people person, Mom.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.502
It'll put them in the mood
for a good time.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.772
Okay? All right, thank you.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.440
I've got to get the ropes
out of the car. Ken!

11:47.474 --> 11:50.077
Oh, God, I left him in the car.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.024
Well, those tables and chairs

12:04.057 --> 12:06.126
look tall and expensive.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.594
What's this?

12:07.627 --> 12:10.230
Organic?!

12:10.263 --> 12:11.364
:
Oh, my God, what?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.465
Excuse me? Hello.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.901
I'm the general manager.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.869
How much are those fireworks,
may I ask?

12:15.903 --> 12:18.105
They're $500 each.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.807
$500? God.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.541
We should've gotten sparklers.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.410
Sparklers would be fine. Mom,

12:23.443 --> 12:25.645
$500 per firework?

12:25.678 --> 12:27.314
We can't put that on the cor...

12:27.347 --> 12:28.782
We can't put that
on the corporate credit card.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.217
We're gonna have
an overdraft charge.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.785
And I'm not gonna put things

12:31.819 --> 12:34.587
on my personal credit card,
thank you very much.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.757
Well, in the words
of Luciano Pavarotti,

12:37.791 --> 12:39.626
"I'm a perfectionist.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.829
I want things to be better."

12:41.862 --> 12:44.297
Who gives a shit
what that jag has to say?

12:44.331 --> 12:45.665
I'm a perfectionist,

12:45.698 --> 12:47.434
and I want it to be better.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.602
We need a big finale.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.171
I think sparklers
would've been fine,

12:51.204 --> 12:52.806
if we had gotten
10,000 sparklers,

12:52.840 --> 12:54.574
that probably would've
cost us, what,

12:54.607 --> 12:55.675
250 bucks?

12:55.708 --> 12:57.010
Sparklers are not a big finale,

12:57.044 --> 12:58.611
-No, no.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.513
Fireworks are always
a crowd-pleaser.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.415
What do you know
about fireworks?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.984
MRS. BASKETS:
You know what?

13:04.017 --> 13:08.621
Ken saved us $1,000
on the carpet.

13:08.655 --> 13:11.024
I just want to have a finale.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.460
I don't want to have
a big, beautiful event,

13:13.493 --> 13:15.929
and then people just go,
"Good night, see you."

13:15.963 --> 13:18.131
I want them to be wowed.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.767
Okay, listen, listen.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.771
I'll put two fireworks...

13:24.804 --> 13:27.774
on my personal credit card,
and that's it.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.775
Two.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.977
Gotcha. Two.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.945
MRS. BASKETS:
Thank you, Dale.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.481
-I'm so excited!

13:34.514 --> 13:36.383
Oh, my God, it's amazing!

13:36.416 --> 13:38.886
-It is so cute.
-Oh, well, hi, Chip.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.389
Welcome to
"A Night at the Opera"

13:42.422 --> 13:43.790
-at the Baskets Family Rodeo...
-Hi.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.791
...where everybody's welcome.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.027
-Thank you.
-Uh, there is, uh, lobster

13:47.060 --> 13:49.062
-and crudités in the VIP room.
-Ooh!

13:49.096 --> 13:51.031
And vegan food for those
with special problems.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.832
-Welcome. -Oh, thank you
so much. Thank you, thank you.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.167
-Thank you.
-Lovely to be here.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.735
Welcome to
the Baskets Family Rodeo,

13:55.768 --> 13:57.204
-where everyone is welcome.
-You look so nice.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.571
A special night at the opera.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.875
Hey, Chip.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.376
Your name, please?

14:03.410 --> 14:05.512
-Martha.
-"Martha."

14:05.545 --> 14:06.914
Last name, please.
I don't go by first names.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.648
There could be
seven Marthas here.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.517
-Chip, come on.
-Okay.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.419
-Hey, Martha. Sorry.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.422
Shouldn't you be back there
doing clown stretches and stuff?

14:15.455 --> 14:17.490
Mom has me working
front of house.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.993
Oh, no, you got demoted.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.529
Well, no, I don't know
if that's really true.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.064
Face it, you got demoted.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.899
Mom is being a control freak.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.035
I-I don't know what's happening.
I'm kind of...

14:28.068 --> 14:29.736
at my wit's end here.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.505
Well, for what it's worth,
you'll probably get

14:32.539 --> 14:36.944
just as many laughs as a
manservant as you do as a clown.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.915
Welcome to the
Baskets Family Rodeo,

14:41.949 --> 14:43.183
where everyone's welcome.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.584
Thanks, Chip.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.219
You really are a good
whatever you're...

14:46.253 --> 14:49.456
-Welcome to the
Baskets Family Rodeo. -Okay.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.958
Thank you, ma'am.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.939
Welcome!

15:05.973 --> 15:07.640
Welcome to

15:07.674 --> 15:12.212
a very special
"Night at the Opera."

15:12.245 --> 15:13.746
ALL:
Yay.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.485
Now get out those Costco cards.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.554
Everybody who has a Costco card

15:21.588 --> 15:24.424
is gonna get a free pair
of Kirkland jeans.

15:27.294 --> 15:31.798
Also, I'd like to acknowledge
some very good friends.

15:31.831 --> 15:35.635
They're here in the VIP section.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.104
Stand up, ladies.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.272
Let's hear it for them.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.740
Well, thank you, thank you.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.343
And, of course,
the Carpet King from Denver

15:43.376 --> 15:46.946
-who gave us all this carpet.
-WOMAN: Oh...

15:46.980 --> 15:48.815
And let's not forget Martha!

15:48.848 --> 15:50.517
-Oh...
-Martha!

15:50.550 --> 15:53.086
Take a bow, Martha. Aw.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.988
Hi.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.157
Well, without further ado,

15:57.190 --> 16:01.928
a beautiful "Night at the Opera"
in Bakersfield.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.434
("Largo al factotum"
by Gioachino Rossini plays)

16:18.045 --> 16:20.980
Wonder when the wheels
are gonna come off this bus.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.183
Reminds me of that time
Mom tried to

16:23.216 --> 16:25.485
take over the, uh,
Cub Scout troop.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.188
Remember that time she took us
into the woods to go camping,

16:28.221 --> 16:29.856
then made us call her Mama Bear?

16:29.889 --> 16:32.492
-Yeah, but that was fun.
-No, it wasn't.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.394
She barely thought it through,

16:34.427 --> 16:36.363
especially the food
and drink part.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.698
I had to drink out of a puddle.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.500
That troop was trouble
from the get-go, Dale.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.235
The dads bailed on us
on that one.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.970
-Mom tried her best.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.574
Well, I got to go
pay some people. Peace out.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.220
-Little presents for you.
-Ooh!

17:00.253 --> 17:01.254
Uno...

17:01.288 --> 17:03.223
-Thank you.
-Dos...

17:03.256 --> 17:05.258
-Tres, cuatro.
-Thank you.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.060
Are you having fun?

17:07.094 --> 17:08.861
Oh, so elegant.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.231
-He's wonderful.

17:11.264 --> 17:14.000
Oh, well, now you know
why I wasn't at cards.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.835
-Oh, of course.
-We understand.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.338
-It was worth it, though,
wasn't it? -Yes, it was.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.873
-Enjoy, enjoy. You're the VIPs.
-Thank you.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.675
Thank you, Christine.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.011
*

17:30.583 --> 17:32.419
Don't worry about them.

17:32.452 --> 17:36.089
I think what you've done here
is spectacular.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.525
I'm really proud of you, baby.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.460
-Mm-hmm.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.530
At first I thought
I was doing it for them and...

17:43.563 --> 17:47.834
now I realize I...
I think I was doing it for me.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.905
-Oh, opera is
something else, isn't it?

17:55.108 --> 17:58.077
What language you think that is?
Portuguese?

18:03.450 --> 18:06.419
So I was on the corner
spinning my sign,

18:06.453 --> 18:08.955
and this rather large lady,

18:08.988 --> 18:11.258
she pulls up in her car
waving at me,

18:11.291 --> 18:13.426
screaming something
about an opera

18:13.460 --> 18:15.328
and how they need sign spinners.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.564
So, that's how I got this job.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.233
How did she find you?

18:20.267 --> 18:23.903
Oh. Between her legs.
I'm her son.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.272
Oh.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.812
Hey, look-look at me.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.182
Yeah, looks good.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.819
So the total rental's
gonna be $1,050.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.588
That's a bit steep.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.257
Well, I had a two-face holer,
but that Christine lady--

18:44.291 --> 18:46.159
mm-mm-- she wanted
the seven-holer.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.094
Well, those holes were empty
most of the time.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.263
-I don't know if that's a...
-Doesn't matter.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.866
Still got to pay for them.
You got a credit card?

18:57.069 --> 19:00.440
Oh, this is the grand finale.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.042
Oh! There's Sleepy.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.977
Sleepy.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.947
Oh, he's so talented.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.582
So natural.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.533
So pretty!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.303
Oh, is that it?

19:30.337 --> 19:32.739
Oh,
is that it?

19:32.772 --> 19:35.475
What do you think, Martha?
Don't you think we need more?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.477
Uh, yeah, more would be great.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.379
It's your night.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.480
MRS. BASKETS:
Hey!

19:40.513 --> 19:42.181
More fireworks.

19:42.215 --> 19:45.218
-But your son, he said only two.
-No.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.019
I'm in charge.

19:47.053 --> 19:50.290
Okay, lady.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.193
Ah!

19:56.363 --> 19:58.231
Did you hear two
or three fireworks?

19:58.265 --> 20:00.833
-Is that two...

20:00.867 --> 20:04.203
-Oh! Ow. Mother!

20:08.040 --> 20:10.042
*

20:20.219 --> 20:22.422
*
