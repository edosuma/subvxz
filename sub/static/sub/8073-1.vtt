00:03.704 --> 00:07.441
[music playing]

00:08.509 --> 00:10.111
There's cake in the fridge.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.646
Dad, make Mom give us cake.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.416
Woman, my son here wants cake.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.518
So does your man.

00:17.551 --> 00:21.289
I better see me some cake
fetchin' goin' on here.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.690
Right now.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.591
I mean it.

00:23.624 --> 00:27.495
Don't make me come over there.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.829
Son, I just lost
control of the house.

00:28.862 --> 00:32.233
It's every man for himself.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.435
I-- I gotta hand
it to you, Rosanne.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.337
You're handling Darlene
leaving pretty well.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.638
Yeah.

00:37.671 --> 00:40.341
Well, it's been kind of a
real special week, you know.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.610
Kinda cool.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.578
And uh, oh, I've got
such a great thing

00:44.612 --> 00:46.380
planned for the drive
up there on Saturday.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.749
We're going to pull over,
you know, and have a picnic.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.951
And then we're going
to get tattooed.

00:50.984 --> 00:51.852
Oh!

00:51.885 --> 00:52.986
She's wanted one from months.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.355
I know.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.157
We're going to get like matching
mother and daughter tattoos.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.559
You know, she's going to get
one that says, "I love mom,"

00:58.592 --> 01:00.994
and I'm getting a skull
with a great big snake

01:01.028 --> 01:02.896
coming out of it.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.333
I think I'm going to cry.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.568
Yeah, but I'm kind of worried
about how it's going to affect

01:07.601 --> 01:08.902
Dan, her leaving, you know.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.904
You know how bad he freaked
out when Becky left.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.706
Yeah, that was bad.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.309
Him and Darlene, they have
that kind of a special buddy

01:15.343 --> 01:16.510
thing going, you know.

01:16.544 --> 01:20.481
She's kind of like his cool son.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.049
Uh, Mom, can I
talk to you a minute?

01:22.082 --> 01:25.085
I need to ask you
a really big favor.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.155
Well, let's see.
I let you go to art school.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.390
And I let your
boyfriend move in.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.592
Oh, yeah, and I gave you life.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.228
Yeah, I guess I owe you one.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.330
I'll just be out
in the kitchen.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.265
Unless you want me to stay.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.102
Well, you know where I'll be.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.143
I was just wondering, can
David take me up to school

01:49.177 --> 01:51.379
instead of you and Dad?

01:51.412 --> 01:52.280
Uh.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.648
Well, Darlene, of course not.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.350
Well, I was just thinking
that, if he took me,

01:56.384 --> 01:59.253
then he'd feel like he
was still part of my life.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.854
And being as you're
such a majorly

02:00.888 --> 02:09.297
cool mom, a mom like no
mom, head mom, my main mom.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.999
Well, you know, this is
very important to your father,

02:12.032 --> 02:12.900
Darlene.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.335
I think you should ask him.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.736
Ask me what?

02:15.769 --> 02:17.605
Uh, Dad, I was just
wondering if it would

02:17.638 --> 02:19.840
be OK if David took me
up to school on Saturday

02:19.873 --> 02:21.642
instead of you guys.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.543
I don't know.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.545
What'd your mom say?

02:24.578 --> 02:26.013
Well, I'm OK with it.

02:26.046 --> 02:29.817
But, you know, how do
you feel about it, Dan?

02:29.850 --> 02:30.718
Sure, what the hell.

02:30.751 --> 02:31.552
Who wants cake?

02:34.322 --> 02:35.189
Thanks, Dad.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.424
You're the best.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.691
Sorry about those teen years.

02:40.628 --> 02:41.829
Um, Dan?

02:41.862 --> 02:43.096
Are you really sure?

02:43.130 --> 02:45.233
You know, I know you were
pretty psyched about this.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.133
Yeah, I know.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.335
I"ll see her next week.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.704
I mean, but you had like
the whole day planned.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.406
I'll get drunk and watch
the Bears game instead.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.675
I'm flexible.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.044
God, I hate it when
you do this, Dan.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.011
Your daughter comes in here.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.380
She walks all over
your feelings,

02:59.413 --> 03:01.515
and then you pretend like it
doesn't even bother you at all.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.651
Everyone can see
how upset you are.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.387
And here you are, just
hiding all of your feelings

03:06.420 --> 03:07.921
in this stupid cake.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.056
Now you've ruined dessert!

03:14.628 --> 03:16.730
I didn't think I'd
take it that hard.

03:16.764 --> 03:21.602
[theme music]

04:06.246 --> 04:09.717
How come she won't let
me drive her to school?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.419
She's almost 17.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.454
Of course she'd rather
go with her boyfriend.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.424
Well, she not even
upset about leaving me.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.825
Look, if you're
this upset about it,

04:17.858 --> 04:19.259
tell her you thought
you were cool with it,

04:19.293 --> 04:21.261
but now you're not.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.096
I can't do that, Dan.

04:23.130 --> 04:27.468
I can't become queen geek now.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.604
Well, then you'll
have to accept it.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.406
But you could become
queen geek, though.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.244
I don't want to be queen geek.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.547
Look, I can't go tell
her that I have a problem

04:39.580 --> 04:40.614
with David taking her up there.

04:40.648 --> 04:41.749
But you could.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.484
You already told her
David could take her.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.685
Yeah, I know.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.586
So what?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.855
You could forbid me to do that.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.524
In what universe?

04:50.558 --> 04:51.525
Please, Dan?

04:51.559 --> 04:52.426
Please?

04:52.460 --> 04:53.761
Forbid me.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.262
I thought you were supposed
to be the man of this house.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.430
Oh, you did not.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.502
[door closes]

05:01.535 --> 05:04.905
DJ: Mom, I'm home
from soccer practice!

05:04.938 --> 05:07.675
Do you smell?

05:07.708 --> 05:10.110
DJ: Yes.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.679
Then take a bath.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.581
DJ: All right.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.984
Oh, they're all just going
to desert us, anyway, Dan.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.086
You know where we went wrong?

05:19.119 --> 05:21.154
We named them.

05:21.188 --> 05:24.257
That's when you
get all attached.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.727
Oh, hon.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.431
It's hard for me, too, but
kids grow up and leave.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.533
That's what they do.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.335
I'm stuck.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.037
- Here, I'll help you, son.
- No, no, no.

05:37.070 --> 05:37.871
Wait.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.450
What's this?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.084
Well, I thought maybe
you could take me up

05:51.118 --> 05:52.486
to school on
Saturday, and that way

05:52.520 --> 05:54.388
you can keep my car
while I'm gone and come

05:54.422 --> 05:55.288
visit me whenever you wanted.

05:57.925 --> 05:58.726
Darlene, sit down.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.632
What is it?

06:04.665 --> 06:06.266
I was thinking.

06:06.299 --> 06:09.336
Maybe we should get engaged.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.439
Engaged?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.674
Yeah.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.676
David, are-- are you
asking me to marry you?

06:18.546 --> 06:19.346
All right.

06:24.384 --> 06:29.723
David, this is so stupid.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.525
I just thought that
if we got engaged,

06:31.559 --> 06:32.793
things might be better.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.762
Your mother might even let
us stay in the same room.

06:34.795 --> 06:35.996
You're not going
to change my mind.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.999
I'm still leaving for
school on Saturday.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.368
Well, then I'm not taking you.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.503
Why not?

06:42.536 --> 06:43.671
Because I've got a date.

06:46.874 --> 06:47.741
You've got a date?

06:47.775 --> 06:49.109
A minute ago, we were engaged.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.211
OK, I don't have a date.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.346
I just want you to know that
if you go away to school, then

06:53.380 --> 06:55.683
I'm going to be
seeing other people.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.017
You're breaking up with me?

06:57.050 --> 06:58.051
Now, wait a minute.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.186
Now, you're the one
who's leaving me,

06:59.219 --> 07:01.321
so you're the one
who's breaking us up.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.690
Oh, go to hell.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.124
No, you go to hell.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.059
DARLENE: You know, I wouldn't
want you to take me, anyway.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.228
I couldn't sit in the same
car with you for two hours.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.129
DAVID: Fine!

07:09.162 --> 07:10.931
God, I hate you!

07:10.964 --> 07:12.265
[door slams]

07:16.203 --> 07:19.306
I really think she
needs to be alone now.

07:19.339 --> 07:23.410
I really think she
needs a ride on Saturday.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.547
OK, but no gloating.

07:26.580 --> 07:32.419
Oh, Darlene, I just
heard what happened.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.954
You know, I'm going
through this huge thing,

07:33.987 --> 07:37.224
and all he's thinking
about is what he wants.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.425
Well, that's men for you.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.929
But listen, we'll talk
this all out on our drive

07:41.962 --> 07:43.697
up there on Saturday.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.965
Oh, I'm not waiting
till Saturday.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.266
I'm leaving tomorrow.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.235
I want to get as far away
from this place as possible.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.402
Well, yeah.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.739
Well, so do I, but
I can't get any time

07:51.772 --> 07:53.040
off work till Saturday.

07:53.073 --> 07:56.076
And you know, I kind of
want to take you up there.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.277
Well, I don't
care what you want.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.813
I never wanted you to take
me in the first place.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.014
I just want to get
away from David.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.182
I want to get away from you.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.717
I hate this whole damn house.

08:03.751 --> 08:04.918
Just leave me alone, OK?

08:09.389 --> 08:10.758
I gotta get something
out of the car.

08:10.791 --> 08:11.592
Honey--

08:27.541 --> 08:28.408
What do you want?

08:28.441 --> 08:30.443
What do you think I want?

08:30.477 --> 08:32.145
I want you to go out
there and apologize.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.915
I want you to tell your
mother that you want her

08:34.948 --> 08:36.316
to take you to school Saturday.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.651
- No.
- No?

08:37.685 --> 08:38.819
Why the hell not?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.187
Because she's just
going to go psychotic when

08:40.220 --> 08:43.223
she gets up there and she sees
that I have my own life now.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.758
You know she's going
to rag on everything.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.026
My school, my
apartment, my roommate.

08:46.059 --> 08:46.927
Yes.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.796
Yes, she absolutely will.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.765
And every time she slams you,
you'll know she's suffering.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.333
And the only way your
mother can deal with pain

08:53.366 --> 08:54.167
is to spread it around.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.973
Why can't she just take
it out on someone else?

09:00.007 --> 09:00.874
Don't worry.

09:00.908 --> 09:01.709
She will.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.346
She's going to
ruin this for me.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.514
I'm the one that's
going to school.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.017
This is supposed to be
my big day, not hers.

09:10.050 --> 09:14.154
Darlene, Darlene,
Darlene, where did you

09:14.187 --> 09:16.089
get a stupid idea like that?

09:18.792 --> 09:21.862
Look, honey.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.665
Don't go to your mom just
because I told you to.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.900
Go to her because
she's your mother

09:26.934 --> 09:29.402
and because she's hurting.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.705
Because she's got too much
pride to show you her feelings.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.406
[door closes]

09:33.440 --> 09:35.709
Well, that's it.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.945
We're going to take you
up there on Saturday,

09:37.978 --> 09:41.148
and I don't give a flying
crap if you like it or not.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.422
Or let her come to you.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.967
You know, usually you have
to go to a movie theater

10:00.000 --> 10:03.804
to find floors with
this kind of texture.

10:03.837 --> 10:04.738
Darlene.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.039
Darlene, would
you come over here

10:06.073 --> 10:10.277
and help me with this thing
far away from your mother?

10:10.310 --> 10:12.379
So what did Darlene say
about me on the ride up here?

10:12.412 --> 10:13.714
She said nothing, Roseanne.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.015
Oh, she did, too, Jackie.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.184
When me and Dan passed
you on that interstate,

10:17.217 --> 10:18.919
I saw her with her
face all scrunched up.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.053
She was doing me.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.188
She was not.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.023
She swallowed a bug.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.096
Socks go in the top drawer.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.664
Why?

10:30.698 --> 10:32.165
Because they just do.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.400
Says who?

10:33.433 --> 10:35.335
God!

10:35.368 --> 10:37.104
I need some help getting
the rest of the stuff

10:37.137 --> 10:38.005
out of the car.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.239
Any volunteers, Darlene?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.742
Ooh, Dad, how subtle.

10:41.775 --> 10:42.876
Your hair is
going out the door.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.679
You might want to follow.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.447
This is your
last day together.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.149
You want to leave her like this?

10:49.182 --> 10:53.653
Jackie, everyone on
Earth knows the sock rule.

10:53.687 --> 10:56.990
You are taking your
daughter to college, Roseanne.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.425
You got what you wanted.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.593
Yeah, but only
because I made her.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.129
She can't wait for me
to get out of here.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.463
Well, you're
making her miserable.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.801
Any sane person would
want you out of here.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.069
You could say goodbye
the right way,

11:09.102 --> 11:11.939
or you can say goodbye your way.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.807
But you're not going
to get a second chance.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.542
DAN: OK.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.778
That's the last of them.

11:17.811 --> 11:18.645
[sighs]

11:20.647 --> 11:24.084
So this is it for windows, huh?

11:24.117 --> 11:25.452
Yeah, why?

11:25.485 --> 11:30.590
Well, becau-- that's because
too many windows can be bad.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.092
Why's that, Jackie?

11:32.125 --> 11:36.396
Well, the birds.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.899
Birds can fly into
the windows and die.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.935
And windows are
very bad for birds.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.008
Well, at least you
got a pretty good view.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.177
I mean, there's a tree.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.746
And there's some grass.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.547
Where?

11:54.581 --> 11:57.717
Underneath that dead guy.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.286
Jackie, if you want to
get that dinner shift,

11:59.319 --> 12:00.453
we've got to leave now.
- OK.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.422
Aw, this is so cool.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.158
I'm so proud of you.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.526
You know, someday
I know that you're

12:06.559 --> 12:08.862
going to write this goodbye
scene in one of your stories.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.530
So when you do, give
me something really

12:10.563 --> 12:12.833
clever and really wise to say.

12:12.866 --> 12:17.170
And uh, maybe a bigger chest.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.105
You got 'em.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.946
Oh, hey.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.048
Here's a credit card
for emergencies.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.549
You can only use it once
because your grandma

12:29.582 --> 12:30.383
doesn't know we have it.

12:35.222 --> 12:38.558
Got it.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.361
Here's some, uh, pizza money.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.963
Always tip the delivery boy.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.764
He is your friend.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.666
Got it.

12:46.699 --> 12:52.272
Uh, here's some
Blackhawk games money.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.274
Opening game, you and me.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.108
Deal.

12:59.980 --> 13:00.948
Here's some dad money.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.283
Just spend it, OK?

13:03.316 --> 13:04.351
OK.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.186
Um, you need anything,
just call collect.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.921
And don't worry.

13:07.955 --> 13:12.392
Every once in a while, I'll
stuff DJ in a hamper for you.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.095
Headfirst, Dad.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.297
Oh, I'll follow as
soon as I, you know,

13:17.330 --> 13:18.765
finish getting
her unpacked here.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.034
Well, drive safe, and
don't flip off anybody

13:21.068 --> 13:21.869
you can't outrun.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.473
Bye.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.740
Hey, Jackie, you
got any gas money?

13:31.244 --> 13:32.479
OK.

13:32.512 --> 13:37.350
So where do you, uh, want
me to put your underwear?

13:37.384 --> 13:39.286
Bottom drawer with the socks.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.687
[inhales]

13:44.291 --> 13:45.325
I'm just going to let you do it.

13:53.867 --> 13:54.801
OK.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.771
Well, I guess I'll,
uh, get going.

13:58.805 --> 14:04.744
I got a lot of, uh,
important, uh, dishes to do.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.346
Boy, it's getting dark
out there, isn't it?

14:06.379 --> 14:07.881
Look at that.
It's clouding up.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.317
You think it might rain?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.551
Yeah.

14:11.584 --> 14:12.685
I think it might rain.

14:12.719 --> 14:13.853
Don't you have
those really crappy

14:13.887 --> 14:16.456
windshield wipers on your car?

14:16.489 --> 14:17.757
Oh, not anymore.

14:17.790 --> 14:18.825
I switched them.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.962
They're on the car
your dad's driving now.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.830
OK, good.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.731
Hm.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.033
Well.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.235
Well, you know, since
it's late and all,

14:28.268 --> 14:31.104
you might just want to crash
here to avoid the rain.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.540
Oh.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.776
Well, I never thought of that.

14:38.979 --> 14:39.846
Yeah.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.514
You know, it's up to you.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.415
Whatever.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.483
Oh, yeah, sure.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.318
Whatever.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.219
Yeah.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.254
Either way.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.923
Whatever.
- Yeah.

14:49.957 --> 14:50.857
You know, either way.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.293
I could, uh, go
home or stay here.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.894
Doesn't matter to
either one of us.

14:54.928 --> 14:55.795
Yeah.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.030
Yeah, you know, I don't know.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.199
Oh, maybe I'll stay.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.002
OK.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.104
All right, I'm just going
to get ready for bed.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.338
I'll be right back.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.639
Well, I'll be here.

15:06.673 --> 15:07.474
OK.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.347
Hey, the rain's
waking up that dead guy.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.022
Mom?

15:22.055 --> 15:23.756
Yeah?

15:23.790 --> 15:27.227
So what do you really
think of my apartment?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.997
I really think it's cool.

15:30.030 --> 15:30.897
You do not.

15:30.930 --> 15:31.898
Yes, I do.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.066
I'm jealous.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.867
You're like the first
Conner woman ever

15:34.901 --> 15:36.836
to have her own apartment.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.638
I wish I could be
more excited about it.

15:38.671 --> 15:39.539
Yeah?

15:39.572 --> 15:40.473
Well, how come you're not?

15:40.507 --> 15:42.109
Because of that
whole David thing?

15:42.142 --> 15:43.010
Yeah.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.044
He hates me now.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.545
He wants to see other people.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.813
Oh, they always say that.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.616
It's in the handbook.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.785
But what if he does
see someone else?

15:52.819 --> 15:55.989
Darlene, David really cares
about you a lot, you know.

15:56.023 --> 16:00.093
And anyway, a boy that short
doesn't have that many options.

16:04.697 --> 16:08.568
Mom, there's something I
kind of want to tell you.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.041
OK.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.577
I kind of want to hear it.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.780
I slept with David.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.749
Oh.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.517
Are you mad?

16:24.551 --> 16:25.952
Hm.
I don't know.

16:25.985 --> 16:26.786
Was I home?

16:31.558 --> 16:32.659
No.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.127
Were you?

16:34.161 --> 16:35.562
Yeah.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.463
[sighs]

16:37.997 --> 16:40.267
Well, jeez.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.770
Big-time grown-up stuff, huh?

16:43.803 --> 16:46.239
Yeah.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.840
I was careful.

16:47.874 --> 16:48.741
Yeah.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.944
Well, I knew you would be.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.013
Are you disappointed in me?

16:54.047 --> 16:56.249
Hm, no, not really.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.750
I kind of knew
all along, anyway.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.487
I just sort of pretended I
didn't so I could, you know,

17:00.520 --> 17:01.321
live.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.459
Well, how come it's so much
harder to break up with a guy

17:06.493 --> 17:08.328
after you slept with him?

17:08.361 --> 17:13.366
Well, because all human
beings connect sex and love.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.201
Except for men.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.308
OK.

17:21.341 --> 17:26.179
Uh, were you a virgin
when you married Dad?

17:26.213 --> 17:27.013
Yes, I was.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.684
- Really?
- Absolutely.

17:31.718 --> 17:32.585
I still am.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.625
Oh.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.459
So you weren't.

17:43.029 --> 17:43.896
No.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.332
No.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.299
OK?

17:46.333 --> 17:47.700
No.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.601
Wow.

17:48.635 --> 17:49.936
My mom's a big tramp.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.341
Don't get so excited, Darlene.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.476
I did it with your dad.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.945
So Dad's the only one you did
it with before you married him?

17:58.978 --> 18:06.853
According to the rules
I have set in my own mind,

18:06.886 --> 18:08.054
I'm going to say no.

18:08.087 --> 18:12.091
No, your father is the
only one that counted.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.693
Hey, you can't do that.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.562
If you did it, it counts.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.330
Hey, I'll tell you
whether it counts or not.

18:20.200 --> 18:26.072
So did it count with David?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.640
Yeah.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.842
David counted.

18:29.876 --> 18:34.314
Well, that's good.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.516
Thanks for staying, Mom.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.985
This is the first
time we ever talked.

18:39.018 --> 18:41.854
You know, like friends.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.223
Hm.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.257
Yeah.

18:44.291 --> 18:48.127
Well, we could be
friends, definitely.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.061
Yeah.

18:49.095 --> 18:52.365
That'd be good if
we'd be friends.

18:52.399 --> 18:56.703
You know, Darlene, even
if I was not your mother,

18:56.736 --> 18:58.305
I would still like to know you.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.465
Come on, honey.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.899
This bed ain't
getting any warmer.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.276
You know, Dan, I'm
a really good mom.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.910
No arguments here.

19:37.944 --> 19:38.911
No, no, no.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.947
I mean like a really,
really good mom.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.715
Like top five, you know?

19:42.749 --> 19:45.685
Giving Mary a run for her money.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.220
Haloed one's got
nothing on you.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.492
And you don't suck as a dad.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.193
You're beautiful.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.562
You're horny.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.431
Get over here.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.199
[giggling]

20:02.569 --> 20:04.136
So you want to be ribbed
or tickled tonight?

20:11.478 --> 20:13.580
Tonight, let's
not use nothing.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.548
You don't think our
lovemaking is dangerous enough?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.887
I want another kid.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.889
What?

20:22.922 --> 20:25.492
You know, maybe the fourth
time, we'll get one of them

20:25.525 --> 20:26.659
worker kids, you know?

20:26.693 --> 20:29.529
The kind that like support
you in your old age

20:29.562 --> 20:32.131
and avenge your death,
like in movies and stuff.

20:32.164 --> 20:35.568
Ah, a fictional child.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.937
I'm only gonna
say this once, Dan.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.972
And tomorrow, if you
ask me, I might deny

20:40.006 --> 20:41.173
that I ever said it at all.

20:41.207 --> 20:45.412
But I like having kids.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.245
Our kids?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.318
Remember when
Darlene was six and she

20:51.351 --> 20:53.252
took one of your unemployment
checks to school for show

20:53.286 --> 20:54.153
and tell?

20:54.186 --> 20:57.023
Oh, come on.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.791
Honey, don't do this.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.693
And remember when
Becky was eight and she

21:00.727 --> 21:02.629
was singing along with the
radio, trying to act real cool,

21:02.662 --> 21:04.263
but she got all the words wrong?

21:04.297 --> 21:06.899
Remember?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.735
It's not like I haven't
thought about this.

21:08.768 --> 21:12.171
I just think I'd be a lot
more rational about it

21:12.204 --> 21:13.072
in 15 minutes.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.611
OK Well, I can
wait 15 minutes.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.052
Oh, what the hell?

21:26.085 --> 21:29.188
A fourth one won't kill me.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.223
[giggling]

21:32.224 --> 21:36.062
[music playing]
