WEBVTT

00:03.820 --> 00:05.253
That was amazing.

00:05.422 --> 00:08.084
You're so dirty.
But that's what I love about...

00:08.258 --> 00:10.453
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know
that you guys were there.

00:10.627 --> 00:13.187
Hello, gentlemen.
And welcome to the playoffs.

00:13.363 --> 00:15.354
<i>Game one, very exciting.</i>

00:15.532 --> 00:20.765
We've got Ruxin versus Andre,
making a rare appearance in the playoffs.

00:20.937 --> 00:23.098
- <i>Good on you, kid.</i>
- You know it. I'm ready.

00:23.273 --> 00:27.471
Game two,
we've got your three-peat champion...

00:27.644 --> 00:30.112
...taking on Kevin.
Or actually, should I say Jenny?

00:30.280 --> 00:32.339
No. I'm gonna make
my decisions this year.

00:32.515 --> 00:35.712
So the three out-of-town idiots
have already shat the bed, of course.

00:35.885 --> 00:38.820
Taco, looks like your dial-up connection
finally caught up with you.

00:38.988 --> 00:41.149
- Come on, Internet.
- <i>Are you even getting this?</i>

00:41.324 --> 00:43.815
There's a reason that Meegan and I
have gotten a divorce.

00:43.993 --> 00:46.484
<i>I was in love with another woman, Shiva.</i>

00:46.663 --> 00:48.961
<i>Our high-school valedictorian</i>
<i>has become my trophy wife.</i>

00:49.132 --> 00:52.499
And I don't think she's going anywhere
any time soon, guys.

00:52.669 --> 00:54.000
<i>What's that?</i>

00:54.504 --> 00:57.200
<i>Oh, you naughty little minx.</i>

00:57.373 --> 00:58.397
Okay.

01:00.410 --> 01:02.207
All right, sweetie, I'll be gentle.

01:02.378 --> 01:04.869
- That's not necessary.
- <i>It's okay. You can watch.</i>

01:05.048 --> 01:06.709
<i>Oh, Shiva.</i>

01:06.883 --> 01:08.316
Okay, enough. Out.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.679
See you on the gridiron, boys.

01:15.959 --> 01:18.689
It's really sweet to be here
with you, alone. Without the baby.

01:18.862 --> 01:21.296
Mm-hm. I think it's good.
It's good we get a little break.

01:21.464 --> 01:22.795
We go home. We enjoy him.

01:22.966 --> 01:25.264
He gets a little break from us.
He learns to be on his own.

01:25.435 --> 01:27.926
Yeah, but is it important
to have a break right now?

01:28.104 --> 01:31.540
You know, at this age, I feel like
we should be with him all the time.

01:32.242 --> 01:33.573
Um...

01:33.743 --> 01:35.210
No, I think it's natural to...

01:35.612 --> 01:39.070
Oh, my God, we were talking about our son
and you were staring at another woman.

01:39.249 --> 01:41.945
I was just seeing
if she would be a good nanny.

01:42.118 --> 01:45.053
I looked over at you
and you were just down her cleavage.

01:45.221 --> 01:47.917
No. First of all, I couldn't see
down her cleavage from this angle.

01:48.091 --> 01:50.389
Second, I was looking at her
because I look at everyone...

01:50.560 --> 01:53.893
...because I, as you know, am a keen
observer of the human experience.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.590
Right? I'm like a Ken Burns documentary.

01:56.766 --> 01:59.860
If anything, I was checking her out
to see how you stacked up.

02:00.036 --> 02:03.403
And let me tell you, you just won.
This is like the final four, okay?

02:03.573 --> 02:06.804
So you just passed through that bracket
and now you're playing Syracuse.

02:06.976 --> 02:10.036
Which is that surprisingly fit 40-year-old
a couple booths back.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.475
You are a pig.

02:11.648 --> 02:14.139
Are we still gonna go to Pinkberry
on the way home?

02:14.317 --> 02:16.114
No. You suck.

02:17.821 --> 02:19.584
Welcome to mediation.

02:19.756 --> 02:21.883
- You understand how this works?
- I think so. Yeah.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.889
- You think so?
- I believe so.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.221
I'd love for you to know so,
so I'll tell you quickly.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.421
I have Meegan's assets here...

02:28.598 --> 02:30.589
...that she has given me.
Her financial statements.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.667
Been waiting on yours.
I hope you brought them.

02:32.836 --> 02:35.498
- I do have them with me.
- You did bring them today. Outstanding.

02:35.672 --> 02:39.438
I do apologize. I realize I'm a little bit tardy.
I wanted to get somewhat organized.

02:39.609 --> 02:43.443
We got mostly business stuff in the baggie.
Might be an errant thing or two.

02:43.613 --> 02:45.808
- And you can make your way.
- Sure.

02:45.982 --> 02:49.975
Uh, that is not how you spell "receipts,"
but I assume these are receipts from 2008?

02:50.153 --> 02:51.780
I was just chicken scratching it out.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.515
Was there...? There was food
in this bag at some point?

02:54.691 --> 02:57.489
At some point,
there were some food items in the bag.

02:59.627 --> 03:00.616
These are just batteries.
Are these an asset?

03:00.795 --> 03:03.320
Those are rechargeable.
I wouldn't mind having those.

03:03.498 --> 03:06.399
Um... I can't count...
No way to count that.

03:06.568 --> 03:09.002
- One left.
- Are you considering the string an asset?

03:09.170 --> 03:10.194
- Is this...?
- No.

03:10.372 --> 03:12.135
Just another thing that doesn't
need to be in the box.

03:12.374 --> 03:14.842
- Was there food also in the shoebox too?
- No food.

03:15.009 --> 03:18.035
- Where's the food smell?
- Some of the receipts might be from...

03:18.213 --> 03:19.805
...a taco bag.
- It's also from the box.

03:19.981 --> 03:21.471
It's from the box and the bag a bit.

03:21.649 --> 03:24.880
Oh, there is only one very specific request
that Meegan has made...

03:25.053 --> 03:28.284
...which is she would like
the <i>Benjamin Button</i> DVD.

03:28.456 --> 03:31.516
I would like to make a statement
of goodwill and buy her a new one.

03:31.693 --> 03:33.718
Just have it sent over.
Just bury the hatchet.

03:33.895 --> 03:36.989
- Oh, okay. Oh, that is such a good movie.
- Mm.

03:38.366 --> 03:42.166
Especially when they get to New Orleans.
Are you texting on your phone?

03:42.337 --> 03:45.602
I got a little, uh, Roethlisberger update
on the elbow.

03:45.774 --> 03:48.470
- It's just kind of a knee-jerk reaction.
- Is that code for something?

03:48.643 --> 03:50.406
- I don't know what that is.
- Sorry about that.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.273
- I hope you're taking this seriously.
- I am.

03:52.447 --> 03:54.745
I can assure you that
Meegan is taking this very seriously.

03:56.117 --> 03:58.210
You can't answer your phone
during a mediator session.

03:58.386 --> 04:00.115
- It was a player alert.
- It doesn't matter.

04:00.288 --> 04:02.552
This guy holds your life in his hands.

04:02.724 --> 04:06.023
- He doesn't hold my life. He holds my stuff.
- Yeah, your stuff.

04:06.194 --> 04:09.322
- Chicks want stuff.
- I don't need stuff.

04:09.497 --> 04:13.058
I got wit and charm and personality.
I'm bringing me to the table.

04:14.736 --> 04:17.933
Yeah, you're gonna need stuff.
Lots of stuff.

04:18.106 --> 04:20.505
- You know what, I know what this is.
- What? What is this?

04:20.675 --> 04:22.302
You're not concerned about
my well-being.

04:22.477 --> 04:24.843
You might be concerned about
our match-up.

04:25.013 --> 04:27.345
- I'm not concerned at all.
- You wanna put a wager behind it?

04:27.515 --> 04:28.846
Sure. What do you wanna bet?

04:29.017 --> 04:30.507
- The usual bet.
- The usual bet.

04:30.685 --> 04:32.175
- Mm-hm.
- Let's do it, buddy.

04:32.353 --> 04:34.150
Ooh, confidence, swagger.

04:34.322 --> 04:36.688
So this is what happens
when I'm not around.

04:36.858 --> 04:38.416
- Oh, no.
- Oh, boy.

04:38.593 --> 04:39.787
- No.
- What?

04:39.961 --> 04:41.758
- You look like Powder.
- Love that movie.

04:41.930 --> 04:44.160
What outfit lost to this one? Huh?

04:44.332 --> 04:46.425
What outfit did you hold up
and you were like, "No"?

04:46.601 --> 04:48.193
This one says pedophile.

04:48.436 --> 04:50.370
Where you been the last few weeks?
You're a ghost.

04:50.538 --> 04:53.837
- Heh.
- I called you and you didn't answer.

04:54.008 --> 04:55.669
- Mm-hm.
- Did you call?

04:55.844 --> 04:56.902
- Are you seeing this?
- Yeah.

04:57.078 --> 05:00.377
We got odd behavior,
avoidance of friends, change of schedule.

05:00.548 --> 05:02.140
- Check, check, check.
- Girlfriend.

05:02.317 --> 05:04.649
- First of all, let's say I have a girlfriend.
- Uh-huh.

05:04.819 --> 05:07.481
But if I did have a girlfriend,
a gentleman never tells.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.520
- Oh, bullshit.
- Bullshit.

05:09.691 --> 05:10.885
- What?
- Stop, dude.

05:11.059 --> 05:12.549
A gentleman never tells if she's ugly.

05:12.727 --> 05:16.322
If she's hot, he takes a picture of her
and mass texts it to all his friends.

05:16.498 --> 05:18.329
Okay, I'm buying you guys a drink.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.592
Taco, what are you drinking?

05:19.767 --> 05:21.735
- Hey.
- Whoa. Jesus, where'd you come from?

05:21.903 --> 05:23.165
Bathroom window was open.

05:23.338 --> 05:26.637
You know what,
I'll take a glass of three-penis wine, please.

05:27.075 --> 05:29.134
- What is, uh, that?
- It's Chinese.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.801
It's made from the penis of a dog,
a snake and a deer.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.505
- Of course.
- It enhances male virility.

05:34.682 --> 05:35.706
Your second choice?

05:35.884 --> 05:38.819
- Two-penis wine would be good.
- I'm just gonna get you a Bud Light.

05:38.987 --> 05:42.479
I'm a little embarrassed to say this,
but I haven't been with a woman...

05:42.657 --> 05:44.386
...in over a week and a half.
- Oh.

05:44.559 --> 05:46.584
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, no.

05:46.761 --> 05:49.730
Hey, Frank, dirty, dirty, rocks
with a splash of Tabasco.

05:49.898 --> 05:50.922
Whoa, hard stuff.

05:51.099 --> 05:54.159
- What ails you, Satan?
- My wife. She's super-pissed at me.

05:54.335 --> 05:56.428
You're lucky, it's Christmas.
Get her a little gift...

05:56.604 --> 05:59.164
No, I wish I could buy my way out,
but it's not gonna happen.

05:59.340 --> 06:05.279
The only thing Sofia wants right now
are these ridiculous Chinese figurines.

06:05.446 --> 06:08.847
So I need to go down
to Chinatown to buy them.

06:09.017 --> 06:10.450
I do not like that place.

06:10.618 --> 06:12.245
It smells like hot garbage.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.445
I'll take you.
I know my way around there.

06:14.622 --> 06:16.590
I have to pick up
some three-penis wine anyway.

06:16.758 --> 06:19.283
So we go down there, and we'll get...

06:20.161 --> 06:22.186
Sorry. What was the product
that you wanted?

06:22.363 --> 06:23.921
Don't even worry about it.

06:25.099 --> 06:27.363
I don't know what to do here.
Kurt Warner? Peyton Manning?

06:27.535 --> 06:29.059
Which one do I start?

06:29.237 --> 06:31.432
Manning got us here.
We gotta stick with him.

06:32.941 --> 06:34.238
- I'm gonna go with Warner.
- Don't.

06:34.409 --> 06:36.900
- I'm making an executive decision.
- I think you're freaking out.

06:37.078 --> 06:39.046
- You're making an executive decision?
- No. Yep.

06:39.213 --> 06:41.443
And it is over. My decision's been made.

06:41.616 --> 06:43.516
Stick with Manning,
he's been so good to us this year.

06:43.685 --> 06:47.553
I know he's been good, but I really
have a gut instinct about Kurt Warner.

06:47.722 --> 06:51.021
- You have horrible gut instincts.
- I don't have horrible instincts.

06:51.192 --> 06:55.185
- When have my instincts led us awry?
- You thought Ellie was gonna be a boy.

06:55.363 --> 06:57.558
Even though the doctors
said she was gonna be a girl.

06:57.732 --> 07:00.758
And then she was born
and you still thought she was a boy.

07:00.935 --> 07:04.564
Nobody knows what's going on down there,
it's a very confusing situation.

07:04.739 --> 07:08.903
The vagina's got so many
different areas and flaps.

07:09.077 --> 07:10.874
It's like you never know
what's gonna pop out.

07:11.879 --> 07:14.074
You're just freaking out right now.
That's all it is.

07:14.248 --> 07:16.739
You're really doing this
because this is the playoffs.

07:16.918 --> 07:18.442
- You're just overthinking.
- I'm not.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.645
There's no thinking going on.
Nothing here.

07:20.822 --> 07:24.258
I'm thinking with my gut, like a man.

07:24.425 --> 07:25.585
Wearing those man pants.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.920
Yes. Man pants.

07:27.095 --> 07:28.858
- Maybe just a little too snug.
- Nope.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.759
- Really?
- Thirty-one, 32's.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.829
- Thirty-four, 32's.
- Okay.

07:34.002 --> 07:35.993
- Go with Peyton.
- I don't want to.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.468
- You're being a child.
- I'm not being a child.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.473
- Why are you not listening to me?
- I wanna listen to myself.

07:41.643 --> 07:43.941
Enjoy losing.
We could have won, one year.

07:48.182 --> 07:51.151
We're spending 20 minutes
at Craig's, then we're out of here. Got it?

07:51.319 --> 07:54.049
- Fine. Please, hold my lip gloss.
- No, I can't hold your lip gloss.

07:54.222 --> 07:55.621
I've got a whole system.

07:55.790 --> 07:58.953
Back left pocket, wallet.
Front right pocket, cell phone.

07:59.127 --> 08:00.617
Front left pocket, freedom...

08:00.795 --> 08:03.389
...for a possible leg crossover
during conversation.

08:03.564 --> 08:05.464
"That's an interesting point."
Boom, I'm there.

08:05.633 --> 08:08.295
I had no idea
how complex man pants actually were.

08:08.469 --> 08:10.334
- I'm not gonna be your lip-gloss Sherpa.
- Fine.

08:10.505 --> 08:13.599
- Carry your own shit.
- I will hold my lip gloss. Put in Manning.

08:13.775 --> 08:15.402
- This is my team, and my...
- Hey.

08:15.576 --> 08:16.702
- Hey.
- Mr. and Mrs. Bickerson.

08:16.878 --> 08:17.970
- Hey. Hi.
- Merry Christmas.

08:18.146 --> 08:19.545
- Pete. How are you?
- Happy holidays.

08:19.714 --> 08:21.147
Uh, anything I can help out with?

08:21.315 --> 08:22.873
- No.
- Mm-mm. We're good.

08:23.051 --> 08:25.246
- Anybody seen Craig around?
- No. Just got here.

08:25.420 --> 08:26.887
All right, I'm gonna go find him...

08:27.055 --> 08:29.319
...say something witty,
so he knows I was here.

08:29.490 --> 08:31.481
And then I am out. You should join me.

08:31.659 --> 08:33.251
- We'll be right behind you.
- Don't dally.

08:33.428 --> 08:35.328
- Could we get out of here now?
- I'm doing you a favor.

08:35.496 --> 08:38.397
Otherwise we just go, we watch
the game and your entire chances...

08:38.566 --> 08:40.500
...of winning the playoffs
go down the drain.

08:40.668 --> 08:41.726
You're evil.

08:41.903 --> 08:43.871
Wow. What do you keep
in place of your soul?

08:44.038 --> 08:45.733
Maybe you should put
your lip gloss there.

08:48.509 --> 08:49.533
Bryce.

08:49.711 --> 08:51.542
- Uh, hello.
- Mr. Eckhart.

08:51.713 --> 08:53.681
Nice to see you.

08:54.649 --> 08:57.880
I gotta say it's a little awkward
seeing you here after the mediation.

08:58.052 --> 08:59.576
No. Let's not let it be weird.

08:59.754 --> 09:01.221
- This is Bryce at a party.
- Yeah.

09:01.389 --> 09:03.380
- We're not in the mediation room.
- Great.

09:03.558 --> 09:05.822
- I'm just here as a friend of Craig's.
- Excellent.

09:05.993 --> 09:09.861
- How do you guys know each other?
- We are in a soup group together.

09:10.031 --> 09:11.658
- Soup group.
- You know what that is?

09:11.833 --> 09:13.733
It's actually an idea
from Oprah's magazine.

09:13.968 --> 09:17.961
We forage, uh, in public places
and, like, city parks...

09:18.139 --> 09:21.040
...and forest preserves
and along the lakeshore...

09:21.209 --> 09:25.236
...and we make soups
out of only found items.

09:26.614 --> 09:28.548
- It wasn't a joke.
- Uh, it's not a joke?

09:29.417 --> 09:30.543
Why would I joke about that?

09:31.319 --> 09:32.911
Well, I, uh...

09:33.087 --> 09:34.816
I'm gonna, um...

09:34.989 --> 09:36.217
- I'm just gonna...
- Okay.

09:36.390 --> 09:38.255
- Yeah.
- Make it weird. Gonna make it weird.

09:40.394 --> 09:43.329
Apparently this place is really good. It's
Tom Berenger's favorite Chinese restaurant.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.229
Hi, table for two please?

09:47.635 --> 09:49.762
Uh... Should we seat
ourselves, or...?

09:51.038 --> 09:52.528
What is he...?

09:52.707 --> 09:54.766
How about we seat ourselves
because you're so pleasant.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.409
Thank you.

09:57.411 --> 09:59.902
These figurines are awesome.
I appreciate you helping me.

10:00.081 --> 10:02.606
- I am so hungry.
- Oh, me too.

10:02.784 --> 10:05.048
- Oh, brother. I am hung...
- All right.

10:05.219 --> 10:07.016
Yummy. Yum, yum, yum.

10:07.188 --> 10:10.885
My three-penis wine
is gonna get me out of my sexual funk.

10:11.058 --> 10:14.425
It's made from snake penis,
dog penis and deer penis.

10:14.595 --> 10:16.722
I'm pretty sure the deer penis
does most of the work...

10:16.898 --> 10:18.695
...and the two are just kind of for taste.

10:18.866 --> 10:22.700
You realize drinking that stuff is just, like,
one step away from chugging dongs, right?

10:22.870 --> 10:24.269
Potato, potato.

10:25.373 --> 10:26.806
Aw...

10:27.341 --> 10:28.899
Look at that little guy.

10:29.076 --> 10:30.407
Look at him with the chair.

10:31.579 --> 10:33.444
Oh, getting comfy. Getting co...

10:33.614 --> 10:36.708
Aw, chewing on his tongue like it's gum.

10:36.884 --> 10:41.947
Now, a guy like that,
is he slow or is he a frittata?

10:42.123 --> 10:45.957
Well, the guy that I knew like that,
I used to call him, um, Tony.

10:46.127 --> 10:48.891
But that was his name. So I...

10:49.063 --> 10:50.655
Are you a Tony?

10:51.032 --> 10:52.465
I'm Taco.

10:53.034 --> 10:54.399
Poor Chinese frittata.

10:56.103 --> 10:57.900
- Oh, hey. Hello, sir.
- All right.

10:58.072 --> 11:00.336
I would love a, uh, green tea.

11:00.508 --> 11:02.669
- Oh, yeah.
- We don't.

11:02.844 --> 11:03.868
Hot tea.

11:05.313 --> 11:07.679
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay. Oh, this. Thank you.

11:07.849 --> 11:09.180
This is very helpful.

11:09.350 --> 11:11.682
How about...? What's this?
Can we get some of this?

11:13.087 --> 11:14.145
Well, should we get them?

11:15.823 --> 11:18.155
Okay, you're saying, "Oh, no, you didn't."

11:19.627 --> 11:21.959
"Oh, girl, no, don't disrespect me."

11:23.331 --> 11:25.799
Okay. Did we just order anything?

11:25.967 --> 11:27.434
I think maybe we're getting soup.

11:27.602 --> 11:30.730
- What makes you say that?
- He was like, "soup." Soup sound.

11:30.905 --> 11:32.839
Hey, he's getting tea.

11:33.007 --> 11:34.907
He got here after us.
How is he getting it first?

11:36.377 --> 11:37.810
How is that guy getting tea?

11:37.979 --> 11:39.810
Oh, he can't even drink it properly.

11:40.214 --> 11:41.841
And now he's getting egg rolls?

11:43.217 --> 11:46.550
I would trade my normal brain
for his brain for one of those egg rolls.

11:46.721 --> 11:48.348
That'd be a pretty fair trade.

11:48.656 --> 11:51.181
Oh, now, that's my beef and broccoli.

11:51.359 --> 11:54.021
Oh, that looks so good.

11:54.195 --> 11:55.287
Oh, I'm so hungry.

11:55.463 --> 11:56.452
Mm.

11:58.547 --> 11:59.377
Now he's throwing it in our face.

11:59.682 --> 12:02.913
Oh. This guy has had a full meal
before we have even had a bite to eat.

12:03.085 --> 12:05.747
And you know why?
Because we don't speak the language.

12:05.921 --> 12:09.084
We are less equipped
than this mentally handicapped person.

12:09.258 --> 12:11.317
I mean, at this point we're sub-frittata.

12:11.493 --> 12:13.290
Mm.

12:16.632 --> 12:19.795
Ladies and gentlemen.
I have a very special surprise for you all.

12:19.969 --> 12:23.803
We're gonna play America's
favorite parlor game, charades.

12:23.973 --> 12:26.533
- So, uh, let the games begin.
- No, no.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.870
- Charades?
- I would rather go to a Klan rally.

12:29.044 --> 12:31.774
- The games are on. We're missing them.
- I'm making a quick exit.

12:31.947 --> 12:34.074
We're gonna follow you.
We're out of here, right?

12:34.249 --> 12:36.114
Mm... Or we stay.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.214
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:39.388 --> 12:41.618
- Charades, right?
- Yeah, exactly.

12:41.790 --> 12:44.020
- You're not leaving are you?
- You know, I was just...

12:44.193 --> 12:45.785
Oh, my God, you can't leave.
We need you.

12:45.961 --> 12:48.156
- You need me?
- A smart guy like you. Come on.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.298
- It's gonna be a hoot.
- Yeah.

12:57.339 --> 12:58.363
Hey.

13:00.209 --> 13:02.336
Okay. Right on, buddy.

13:07.549 --> 13:10.518
Chinatown urinal. I'm forever unclean.

13:12.121 --> 13:13.850
- Don't laugh.
- Piss.

13:14.023 --> 13:15.684
I didn't piss on my hand.

13:17.059 --> 13:18.924
Old-Chinese-man piss.

13:19.094 --> 13:20.925
Whoo! It's a tough one. Okay.

13:24.867 --> 13:26.164
Um...

13:26.335 --> 13:28.394
- Okay.
- Eyes? Focus.

13:28.570 --> 13:30.538
That was to the team,
not part of the game.

13:30.706 --> 13:32.503
- <i>The Karate Kid?</i>
- <i>The Animal?</i>

13:32.675 --> 13:33.699
The...

13:33.876 --> 13:37.903
Would you like to wait for a gesture,
or would you like to keep guessing? Okay.

13:38.414 --> 13:39.540
- Ten?
- Ten words?

13:39.715 --> 13:42.047
- Ten words?
- Second word?

13:42.217 --> 13:44.344
<i>A Funny Thing Happened</i>
<i>on the Way to the Forum?</i>

13:44.520 --> 13:46.181
Yes, yes, yes. Nice.

13:46.355 --> 13:50.951
- All right. Go team. Good job, Bryce.
- Good.

13:51.126 --> 13:53.617
Can you tell sexual orientation
by how much he loves charades?

13:53.796 --> 13:55.388
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, I think so.

13:55.964 --> 13:57.397
- TV show.
- <i>Boy in the Bubble.</i>

13:57.566 --> 13:58.794
TV show. Two words.

13:58.967 --> 14:00.059
- Sounds like...
- Giant prick.

14:00.235 --> 14:01.827
- Rose.
- <i>Melrose Place.</i>

14:02.004 --> 14:04.404
- <i>Melrose Place.</i> Nice.
- Yay!

14:04.573 --> 14:06.131
- Nice, Craig.
- Yay.

14:06.508 --> 14:08.738
Movie? One word.

14:08.911 --> 14:10.310
- <i>Equus.</i>
- <i>Hoosiers.</i>

14:10.479 --> 14:11.707
<i>Dune? Dune?</i>

14:11.880 --> 14:12.938
Is it <i>Dune?</i> Is it <i>Dune?</i>

14:13.115 --> 14:15.049
- It's not <i>Dune.</i>
<i>- Space Walk? Moonwalker?</i>

14:15.217 --> 14:16.684
- Garbage?
- <i>Man on the Moon?</i>

14:16.852 --> 14:19.616
- <i>Repo Man.</i>
- You're tired. You're mad.

14:19.788 --> 14:21.813
- You're a mad farmer?
- <i>Beaches.</i>

14:21.990 --> 14:23.753
<i>Beaches.</i> Come on.

14:23.926 --> 14:27.418
You were acting like a mad, space hobo.
I'm sorry.

14:28.797 --> 14:30.355
That was bad.

14:32.167 --> 14:36.126
So we are down by eight.
We have one round to make it up.

14:36.305 --> 14:38.603
Let's do this, guys, come on.
Let's do this, come on.

14:38.774 --> 14:41.242
<i>Let's win, let's win, let's win.</i>

14:41.410 --> 14:43.002
<i>Let's win, let's win, let's win.</i>

14:43.178 --> 14:44.440
Please get me out of here.

14:44.613 --> 14:46.979
- Okay, great. Put in Manning, we'll leave.
- Really?

14:47.149 --> 14:49.845
Change your lineup.
The afternoon game hasn't even started.

14:50.018 --> 14:53.181
- Fine, I'll do it. Can we get out of here?
- Let's win. Whoo!

14:53.355 --> 14:54.686
- Wow, okay.
- Here we go.

14:54.857 --> 14:56.119
Phew. Yikes, toughie.

14:56.291 --> 14:57.656
- Time.
- Let's go, let's go.

14:58.227 --> 15:00.092
Uh... Uh...

15:00.262 --> 15:02.856
Book. First word.

15:03.031 --> 15:04.555
- Little.
- Small word.

15:04.733 --> 15:07.099
- The. Second word.
- Let's go.

15:07.269 --> 15:09.294
- Uh...
- Face. Your face.

15:09.471 --> 15:10.995
Gay.

15:11.173 --> 15:14.472
Uh, sorry.
I didn't mean that in terms of you.

15:14.643 --> 15:17.476
It was more in terms
of the character you were portraying.

15:17.646 --> 15:20.410
I was standing perfectly still,
pointing at my face.

15:20.582 --> 15:21.981
Mask.

15:22.451 --> 15:23.941
We're not doing it anymore.

15:24.119 --> 15:27.555
- Bryce, I'm so sorry that this happened.
- Good day.

15:27.723 --> 15:30.886
- Craig, I will see you at soup group.
- I'm sorry.

15:31.059 --> 15:32.890
Did you say you would see him
at soup group?

15:33.061 --> 15:34.824
- Soup group.
- Wonderful.

15:34.997 --> 15:37.488
Mr. Eckhart, I will have my decision
by the end of the week.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.630
- I bid you adieu.
- Oh, dear God.

15:42.504 --> 15:44.563
- Not good.
- Yeah.

15:47.075 --> 15:48.372
How was the bathroom?

15:48.777 --> 15:51.007
It was fine. I just washed my hands.

15:51.180 --> 15:52.442
Did you order anything yet?

15:52.614 --> 15:53.774
No. They didn't come by.

15:53.949 --> 15:57.817
I cracked open the penis wine and I've
never had it on an empty stomach before.

15:57.986 --> 15:59.453
It is really, really working.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.005
You have really thick, lustrous hair.

16:04.175 --> 16:05.642
No, I don't. I use Rogaine.

16:05.810 --> 16:08.836
- Dirty secretary glasses.
- I'm not a dirty secretary.

16:09.114 --> 16:10.411
Girly lips.

16:10.582 --> 16:14.780
Call my lips girly one more time, I will take
this chopstick and shove it in your pee hole.

16:19.824 --> 16:22.384
- What are they?
- I think he's talking about you.

16:25.096 --> 16:26.927
I washed my hands in the urinal.

16:27.499 --> 16:28.523
So?

16:31.035 --> 16:36.234
And now he's making jokes at me,
like some tiny frittata Don Rickles.

16:39.778 --> 16:41.769
I didn't cry. I did not cry in there.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.643
I didn't piss on my hands. Exc...

16:44.816 --> 16:47.114
Excuse me. I did not piss on my hands.

16:47.285 --> 16:50.652
You're being very mean. Thank you.

16:54.159 --> 16:56.559
Your words hurt people.
You need to know that.

16:56.728 --> 16:59.720
You're a dumb, stupid bastard.

16:59.964 --> 17:01.829
That is not... Let's get out of here.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.524
That is not very nice.

17:04.002 --> 17:05.333
You have such silky...

17:05.502 --> 17:06.970
- Taco!
- Sorry.

17:07.172 --> 17:08.104
He cry.

17:14.194 --> 17:17.130
- Did Andre even call you?
- No. I just told everyone to meet us here.

17:17.298 --> 17:20.028
Pick it up, guys,
because the game's almost over. Come on.

17:20.968 --> 17:23.334
- Good, good, good. Hi.
- Hey.

17:23.503 --> 17:25.472
- Happy holidays.
- What can I get you?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.574
Was wondering if you could turn
that television...

17:27.742 --> 17:29.175
...to the Philly-San Francisco game.

17:29.343 --> 17:30.708
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No.

17:30.878 --> 17:33.870
I understand the Bears game is close,
and that game is a blowout.

17:34.048 --> 17:36.209
- There's a lot of implications on the line.
- Whole lot.

17:36.384 --> 17:39.251
We both have players on the Eagles.
He's got Brian Westbrook.

17:39.420 --> 17:41.479
I've got Donovan McNabb.
It's very close.

17:41.656 --> 17:43.453
It would mean a lot to us.
You understand?

17:43.624 --> 17:44.989
It was a Fantasy Football thing...

17:45.159 --> 17:46.183
- Yes.
- Yes.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.624
- That was my fault initially.
- You'll change the channel?

17:48.796 --> 17:50.058
No. We can't do it.

17:50.231 --> 17:51.459
I will drink a lot.

17:51.632 --> 17:54.328
She is a lush.
She will drink this whole bar down.

17:54.502 --> 17:57.767
- She will vomit in her hair. Trust me.
- Everyone here will remember it.

17:57.938 --> 18:01.271
She will not do any of these things,
because she is a respectable mother.

18:01.442 --> 18:02.932
One second.

18:03.477 --> 18:04.671
- No love.
- Hey, hey, hey.

18:04.845 --> 18:07.746
- What's going on with the game?
- Warden won't change the channel.

18:07.915 --> 18:11.316
- Where have you guys been?
- I had to go get some figurines for my wife.

18:11.485 --> 18:13.248
- Wonderful.
- Hey, Pete. How's it going?

18:14.622 --> 18:16.852
Uh, just he fondled me.
What's the word here?

18:17.024 --> 18:18.048
Oh, Dr. Octopus here?

18:18.225 --> 18:21.422
He drank a bunch of three-penis wine
and he's been trying to give me a handy.

18:21.595 --> 18:22.857
Stop it. We were play-wrestling.

18:23.030 --> 18:24.861
What's going on? I got DeSean Jackson.

18:25.032 --> 18:28.160
If he scores a touchdown, I beat Andre
and I'm going to the Shiva Bowl.

18:28.336 --> 18:30.998
Let's get this figured out.
Really? We're gonna watch it on a phone?

18:31.172 --> 18:33.800
- Well, this is the best we can do.
- They're in the red zone.

18:33.974 --> 18:37.307
- And Philly, first and goal at the six.
- Oh, brother.

18:37.478 --> 18:41.039
You know what, guys, I'm not going to
experience my beautiful victory over Kevin...

18:41.215 --> 18:43.240
...on a 3-inch screen
that's constantly refreshing.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.942
We're gonna do this,
we're gonna do this right.

18:46.754 --> 18:49.018
- Buffering 37 percent.
- Oh, oh, oh!

18:49.190 --> 18:51.715
- Whoa! No, no, no.
- One second.

18:51.892 --> 18:53.689
- One second, guys.
- Are you insane?

18:53.861 --> 18:56.022
- Not the menu button.
- Hit the aux button.

18:56.197 --> 18:57.459
Put the Bears back on.

18:57.631 --> 18:59.531
Philly's first, Bears right... One second.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.827
- Go to all channels.
- You don't put the Bears on...

19:02.002 --> 19:04.869
...I will murder the shit out of you.
- All right, enough, sir.

19:05.873 --> 19:08.137
- God, Kevin.
- What are you doing, man?

19:08.309 --> 19:10.470
- Hey.
- My figurine.

19:10.644 --> 19:11.838
- Come on. Put the...
- Whoa.

19:12.012 --> 19:14.879
Down, ape man. You all just back off.

19:15.049 --> 19:16.482
All of you.

19:16.650 --> 19:20.108
I worked really hard this year
to put together an amazing team.

19:20.287 --> 19:22.312
I have studied the waver wire.

19:22.490 --> 19:24.082
I know all the sleepers.

19:24.258 --> 19:26.590
I have done the bi-week plug-ins.
I've done it all.

19:26.761 --> 19:31.130
And all I wanna do is watch the game,
and find out how my team does.

19:31.298 --> 19:32.925
It's really my team. She doesn't really...

19:33.100 --> 19:34.931
Yeah. Hold my purse, Kevin.

19:35.102 --> 19:37.036
- Boys, let's go. Come on.
- Cut you, bitch.

19:37.204 --> 19:38.432
Oh, my God.

19:38.606 --> 19:40.198
- Wow. Jenny, nice work.
- Whoo!

19:40.374 --> 19:42.103
- Whoa.
- Jesus, gangster.

19:42.276 --> 19:44.073
- Nice, Xena.
- Why did you do this?

19:44.245 --> 19:46.270
- Refresh.
- Come on, come on, come on.

19:46.647 --> 19:48.774
- Westbrook, Westbrook.
- Refresh.

19:48.949 --> 19:50.780
- Come on, McNabb.
- Come on.

19:50.951 --> 19:52.714
- McNabb touchdown.
- Touchdown, McNabb.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.684
- He's poor. He's divorced.
- Damn it.

19:54.855 --> 19:56.789
He's in the Shiva Bowl. Thank you.

19:56.957 --> 19:58.652
- Who'd he throw to?
- lf I'd played Warner...

19:58.826 --> 20:00.316
- Who'd he throw to?
...7 extra points.

20:00.494 --> 20:03.019
- Did he throw it to DeSean Jackson?
- Will you not?

20:03.197 --> 20:06.758
He threw to not DeSean Jackson.

20:08.736 --> 20:10.328
No!

20:10.504 --> 20:13.132
My wife is pissed at me.
I ruined her Christmas present.

20:13.607 --> 20:16.508
And my season is over.
My season is over!

20:17.645 --> 20:19.112
Hey, what are you doing? I need that.

20:19.280 --> 20:23.546
Not as much as I do.
I'm gonna, ugh, make my wife happy.

20:24.819 --> 20:26.684
Oh, that's too much.

20:27.388 --> 20:29.856
- Good luck, Hulk.
- See you, Ruxin.

20:31.392 --> 20:33.155
My nipples are rock hard.

20:33.327 --> 20:35.659
I gotta go home and take care of this.
I'll see you guys.

20:35.830 --> 20:38.355
- I thought I had it this year.
- I can't believe that.

20:38.532 --> 20:40.329
And now it's just... It's over, so...

20:40.701 --> 20:42.464
Well, it's not officially over, actually.

20:42.636 --> 20:46.333
There's still a small matter of the bet.

20:46.507 --> 20:48.907
- Yeah. The usual bet.
- Mm-hm.

20:49.076 --> 20:50.873
You didn't make that same bet again?

20:51.045 --> 20:54.674
It's weird though, the usual bet may have
to take a unusual turn this year...

20:54.849 --> 20:59.343
...due to the fact that I technically
did not really run my team.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.147
- That's an excellent point.
- Yeah.

21:01.322 --> 21:04.587
Jenny, you have made it emphatically clear
that you set the lineups.

21:04.758 --> 21:07.158
You do the trades.
You do most of the work, so...

21:07.328 --> 21:09.558
- You're really gonna make me do this?
- Yeah.

21:09.730 --> 21:12.358
You always say
you wanna be one of the boys, Jenny.

21:12.533 --> 21:15.696
And boys do stupid things,
like get naked in alleyways.

21:15.870 --> 21:17.565
Yep. For a minimum of two minutes.

21:18.939 --> 21:21.567
Don't worry though. I'm gonna
hold your purse and your lip gloss.

21:21.742 --> 21:23.107
Yeah. Fine.

21:25.045 --> 21:26.637
No?

21:29.950 --> 21:31.577
- A bet's a bet.
- You ready?

21:31.752 --> 21:33.379
You sure?

21:34.054 --> 21:34.884
Two minutes.

21:37.239 --> 21:39.605
Wow, she's actually doing it.

21:39.775 --> 21:41.572
A bet's a bet.

21:42.712 --> 21:46.614
- How long you wanna make her walk for?
- Jenny, you have any cab money?

21:46.782 --> 21:50.513
- I don't have any money on me right now.
- No? It's...

21:51.687 --> 21:53.848
- Hey, you're naked.
- Yeah.

21:54.223 --> 21:57.021
By the way,
can you believe Andre actually won?

21:57.193 --> 21:59.753
He's in the Shiva Bowl.
He's not even here to enjoy it.

22:01.731 --> 22:03.722
I did it. I did it.

22:04.166 --> 22:05.724
God bless you, Tony Gonzalez.

22:05.901 --> 22:09.337
God bless you and your big,
hairy Tony Gonzalez man balls...

22:09.505 --> 22:11.769
...and the 24 points they gave me.

22:11.974 --> 22:14.772
- I'm going to the Shiva Bowl, baby. Shiva.
- Andre?

22:15.411 --> 22:17.003
Uh, I'm in here.

22:17.413 --> 22:18.437
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:18.614 --> 22:20.809
- What are you doing?
- Just finishing up some work.

22:21.484 --> 22:24.351
- Mm, how's it going?
- It is going great, Shiva.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.078
- Absolutely great.
- Hee-hee.

22:26.255 --> 22:28.018
- Ready for bed?
- Indeed, I am.

22:28.190 --> 22:31.091
- Mm.
- Indeed I am, Shiva.

22:34.530 --> 22:36.828
Oh, yeah, baby. Come to Taco.

22:36.999 --> 22:38.364
Oh, yeah.

22:38.534 --> 22:41.594
You look like that actress
from <i>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</i>.

22:41.771 --> 22:43.830
Yeah, you wanna steal
that other woman's baby.

22:44.006 --> 22:45.268
Yeah. Oh, come on, come on.

22:45.441 --> 22:46.601
Come on. No, no, no.

22:46.776 --> 22:47.970
Hey.

22:48.144 --> 22:49.805
No, no, no. Hey.

22:49.979 --> 22:51.003
This is...

22:52.848 --> 22:53.872
Uh!

22:56.685 --> 22:59.347
Yeah, hi. I'm in the middle of a...

22:59.922 --> 23:02.982
English. Oh, yeah, you so dirty.

23:03.159 --> 23:04.820
I'm gonna do you so...
Yeah, no, not you.

23:04.994 --> 23:08.555
Hey, I'm in the middle of a spank session
here and my Internet just...

23:08.731 --> 23:12.565
Spank session. And the images
are loading really slowly.

23:12.735 --> 23:15.932
Can I upgrade to DSL
for like five minutes?

23:16.105 --> 23:18.869
All I need is five minutes and...
Don't worry about it, it's cool.

23:19.041 --> 23:20.531
What's your name?

23:20.709 --> 23:22.233
How's it going, Lorraine?

23:22.678 --> 23:24.441
Uh, what city you in?

23:24.713 --> 23:26.738
Oh, that's not that far.

23:26.916 --> 23:28.213
You like wine, Lorraine?
