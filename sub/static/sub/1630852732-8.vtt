WEBVTT

01:31.341 --> 01:32.217
Dion?

01:33.802 --> 01:34.636
You ready?

01:35.637 --> 01:36.513
It's showtime.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.151
I got you a surprise.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.571
Auntie Kat told me
not to let you eat it before the show,

01:53.655 --> 01:55.698
but I won't tell her if you won't.

01:59.119 --> 01:59.953
You okay?

02:00.620 --> 02:01.454
You nervous?

02:03.039 --> 02:05.166
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that's all right.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.670
It's a big night.
But you're gonna do great.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.131
Is there anything I can do?

02:13.216 --> 02:15.844
I have to do this by myself.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.515
Okay, I get it.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.061
I know you, and you can do
anything you put your mind to.

02:29.732 --> 02:30.942
Hey, Di, look at me.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.280
I know there's a lot going on right now,
but just remember,

02:35.363 --> 02:37.115
you're doing this for your friends,

02:37.615 --> 02:39.993
so think about them,
a-and you won't get scared.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.494
Okay.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.455
And I'll be right out there
cheering for you.

02:46.624 --> 02:48.293
Can I get a hug before I go?

02:49.294 --> 02:51.254
Or are you too cool to hug your own mom?

02:52.338 --> 02:53.673
I get it, someone might see you.

02:53.756 --> 02:56.134
But when we get home,
I'm giving you a big one, okay?

02:59.554 --> 03:02.265
Hey, buddy, it's gonna be okay.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.601
No, it's not! Brayden's outside.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.061
Brayden? I thought he was gone.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.773
He’s back. He’s right outside and he says
he’s gonna destroy this place.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.401
-Why would he--?
-The Crooked Man took his dad.

03:13.484 --> 03:17.197
His mom died when he was little,
and he's mad that I have friends.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.824
-Let's talk to him.
-You can't go, he'll hurt you!

03:19.908 --> 03:21.826
Bug, I don't have much time left.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.495
But I'm gonna go out of this world
fighting for you.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.663
So where is he?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.136
We have to get Kwame

03:40.220 --> 03:42.931
and tell him we have to cancel the show
and get these kids to safety.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.807
-No!
-Excuse me?

03:44.891 --> 03:47.852
If anyone leaves this building,
he's gonna hurt them.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.979
It's <i>me </i>he wants.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.232
And I <i>know</i> I can take him.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.028
-Then let's go.
-You can't--

03:57.111 --> 04:00.114
Hey, if you're steppin' on the bad side,
I'm coming with you.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.616
And besides, you and me,

04:01.699 --> 04:04.786
we have a great track record
on that football field, don't we?

04:05.745 --> 04:07.288
Okay, let's do it.

04:08.122 --> 04:11.292
Oh, wait here.
There's something I gotta do first.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.299
Hold his arm.

04:18.383 --> 04:23.012
I'm gonna need a line for the benzos
in five, four, three, two, one.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.691
What the hell?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.317
He's going into arrest!

04:36.401 --> 04:38.528
No, I'm not gonna be
the one who kills this guy.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.530
I need an epi, now! Here, hold this.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.365
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.243
-This is incredible.
-He's gonna bottom out.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.494
Look at this.

04:46.577 --> 04:50.290
Competing strands of Powered DNA are
fighting for dominance inside Pat's body.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.626
This right here, this is telekinesis.
I think this one--

04:53.710 --> 04:55.920
For God's sake, David, look at his vitals.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.797
Whatever this is, it's killing him.

04:57.880 --> 04:58.798
Irrelevant.

04:58.881 --> 04:59.716
Irrelevant?

05:00.717 --> 05:01.801
Let me revise that.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.262
If he dies,
we can harvest the DNA from him,

05:04.345 --> 05:06.764
put every one of his organs
under a microscope,

05:06.848 --> 05:08.975
and figure out how to make
superpowers work on command.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.476
Are you that big of a bastard?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.478
We're witnessing
a scientific breakthrough.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.105
We’re witnessing someone dying.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.524
Someone who might hold the key
to saving my sister.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.569
You're not gonna come up with
some miracle cure in the next few hours.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.196
This man is literally
changing at the cellular level.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.283
Then we need to stop him.
Reverse or neutralize the P-DNA.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.577
There's no guarantee
that's not gonna kill him faster.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.997
He's on a journey.
We have to see where he goes.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.874
You are enjoying this.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.586
I'm accepting his gift.

05:37.462 --> 05:41.174
There's no way we could've gotten approval
for this, but he did it to himself.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.886
-Now we can observe, gather information.
-Monetize it for personal wealth.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.721
-Oh God, he's coding.
-Oxygen, now!

05:46.804 --> 05:48.806
All brain and cellular activity
has stopped.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.933
They need defib.
Why aren’t they shocking him?

05:51.017 --> 05:54.020
Not a great idea to shock a guy
who used to turn into an electrical storm.

05:54.103 --> 05:54.937
You…

05:55.563 --> 05:57.398
I am <i>done</i> with you.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.405
-Back up, try again.
-Stand back, Doc. Somebody paste me.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.036
Clear!

06:13.414 --> 06:14.957
Let's shock him again.

06:16.125 --> 06:16.959
Powering up.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.338
-It's over. He's gone. Call it.
-What are you doing?

06:20.421 --> 06:22.465
CPR failed, epi failed, defib failed.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.551
He's gone. You shock him again,
you might be destroying my samples.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.261
Your samples? We need him alive.

06:28.554 --> 06:29.472
He's dead.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.770
Kat, Kat, Kat, Kat, it's no use.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.563
-He's gone.
-No.

06:38.731 --> 06:39.732
I'm sorry.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.902
I want samples taken and analyzed
while he's still warm.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.212
Hey.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.090
Hey. Have you seen Mr. Gary?

07:04.173 --> 07:07.760
I sent him his ticket,
but I'm not sure that he got it.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.597
Wait, where's your costume?

07:14.016 --> 07:16.936
That's what I came to tell you.
I'm not doing the revue.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.898
Seriously? Five minutes
before the show?

07:22.817 --> 07:24.569
-Brayden's outside.
-What?

07:24.652 --> 07:26.237
He says he's gonna hurt everybody.

07:26.821 --> 07:27.822
I'll go get Jonathan.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.032
-The TOJ will fight together.
-No!

07:31.409 --> 07:32.535
He's got help this time.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.163
It's too dangerous out there
for anyone who doesn't have powers.

07:35.246 --> 07:39.167
Your job is to say here
and make sure no one leaves this theater.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.126
How?

07:40.209 --> 07:41.043
Entertain them.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.466
The show must go on.

07:46.549 --> 07:52.305
That's right. The show must go on,
and it has to be great so no one leaves.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.514
I got this.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.807
Of course you do.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.102
Now, I'm gonna try real hard
to be back in time to hear you sing,

07:58.644 --> 08:00.646
but if I'm not, you knock 'em dead.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.150
-And if I don't make it back at all--
-Don't say that.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.447
If I don't make it back at all,

08:09.530 --> 08:11.908
you've got to go on with your life,
and be awesome.

08:13.951 --> 08:14.827
All right?

08:16.621 --> 08:19.290
Places, everyone,
for the opening number! Come on!

08:21.167 --> 08:24.378
-What's happening?
-I'll fill you in later. Come here.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.717
Three become one.
We're stronger together.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.968
Triangle of Justice.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.471
Justice, justice, justice.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.772
Where are you, Nicole?

08:42.855 --> 08:47.443
<i>And now, sit back</i>
<i>and enjoy McKoy on Broadway.</i>

08:56.202 --> 08:58.496
Where's Dion? He's gonna miss his solo.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.165
He-He's outside having
a superfight with Brayden.

09:01.666 --> 09:05.378
He wants us to keep the audience inside
so they don't get murdered. Got it?

09:06.254 --> 09:09.632
-Got it, but who's gonna do Dion's solo?
-I don't know.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.051
Why is Dion not on stage?

09:12.134 --> 09:15.555
-He's not here. What should we do?
-Well, somebody's gotta on in his place.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.849
-Copy that.
-Uh, not you.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.359
-Sh, sh.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.111
-He's killing it.
He's amazing.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.658
He controls the monsters
with his mind now?

11:40.741 --> 11:43.536
Yeah, he controls the monsters
with his mind now.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.329
Hello, Dion.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.082
I see you're not alone.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.252
Neither am I.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.173
Okay, we need a plan
to fight these things.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.760
Maybe we don't need to fight them at all.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.974
<i>Brayden, I know</i>
<i>you can hear me in your mind.</i>

12:05.057 --> 12:08.769
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>
<i>I thought we were friends.</i>

12:08.853 --> 12:11.439
<i>You and Brayden</i>
<i>were never friends.</i>

12:12.189 --> 12:14.942
<i>Your friends are inside that building.</i>

12:15.693 --> 12:18.738
<i>And I'm going to take them all.</i>

12:21.615 --> 12:22.867
So that didn't work.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.712
Mom. Mom, get ready. They're coming!

12:34.795 --> 12:36.338
-[electric zapping[
-Dion, go!

12:36.422 --> 12:39.425
Come on, we have to lead them
away from the school.

12:50.644 --> 12:51.854
You want this?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.817
Mom, they're heading for the school!

13:09.163 --> 13:10.414
Tevin!

13:12.041 --> 13:16.921
I am the Mind Mover!

13:49.119 --> 13:50.871
There's too many of them!

14:09.139 --> 14:10.516
Where did that come from?

14:19.650 --> 14:20.568
What just happened?

14:25.406 --> 14:26.532
What is that?

14:54.101 --> 14:56.854
-Janelle?
-Dude, that was awesome!

14:56.937 --> 14:57.938
That was incredible.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.357
So what's the plan here?

15:00.441 --> 15:02.526
We need to remember
those are innocent people.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.069
They're infected just like I am.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.030
And that kid Brayden's
mind controlling them.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.407
We need to figure out
how to stop them without hurting them.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.912
I can grab Brayden, and teleport him
far away so he can't control them anymore.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.955
Have you ever teleported
with someone else before?

15:15.039 --> 15:16.749
-No.
-How do you know you can do it?

15:16.832 --> 15:19.752
-Because you said I can do anything.
-Of course you can, Bug.

15:19.835 --> 15:22.922
-I just want to keep you safe.
-No one's safe!

15:23.005 --> 15:24.506
-Incoming.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.516
Come on, Kat, it's time to go.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.405
-He's alive.
-God. Help me stabilize him.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.532
I'm okay. I'm okay.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.411
-What? H-H-How?
-I'm okay.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.624
This isn't possible.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.042
I feel fine.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.962
Actually, I feel great. Better than great.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.089
But y-you… You died.

16:05.965 --> 16:06.799
I did?

16:07.716 --> 16:09.259
Well, I didn't realize.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.012
-Oh.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.515
That's new.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.893
Pat, you need to stand down.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.937
Okay? We need to figure out
what happened to you.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.230
Let me examine you.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.899
We don't know what you injected
and what it's doing to your body.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.527
Ah, well, I know… I know one thing.

16:26.610 --> 16:31.281
I know Suzanne wanted to lock me away
for the rest of my life.

16:32.032 --> 16:36.161
And I know that right now,
I don't have to listen to anything

16:36.245 --> 16:37.663
either one of you says.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.750
Not now, and not, uh, ever again.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.586
-Hey, back up.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.840
Suzanne, could you
tell these jokers to move?

16:53.053 --> 16:55.139
You know, I-I came here to help you.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.393
I did… I didn't have to come.
I was fine where I was.

16:59.476 --> 17:03.939
I was… trying to be a good person

17:04.023 --> 17:05.107
and you wouldn't…

17:05.899 --> 17:08.318
You wouldn't let me do that.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.987
You wanted to put me in a cage.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.702
I'm pretty sure I have telekinesis now.

17:19.788 --> 17:20.873
Pat, don't.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.018
I can't let you pass.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.691
"You shall not pass!"

17:51.987 --> 17:54.364
Didn't work out so well
for Gandalf either.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.476
-Get them away!

18:30.943 --> 18:32.820
Dion, go! Teleport!

18:33.403 --> 18:36.365
Where? I… I can't see Brayden!

18:38.450 --> 18:39.535
Are you okay?

18:56.218 --> 18:58.554
<i>Your friends are powerful.</i>

18:58.637 --> 19:01.682
<i>But not all of your friends have powers.</i>

19:03.559 --> 19:04.643
Mom!

19:08.647 --> 19:09.898
Leave her alone!

19:09.982 --> 19:10.816
Dion, wait!

19:12.359 --> 19:14.111
Dion!

19:15.070 --> 19:15.904
Tevin!

19:19.783 --> 19:21.410
<i>I can read your thoughts.</i>

19:21.493 --> 19:23.954
<i>-I know where you're going.</i>
-Mom! No.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.792
Let go of me. Get off me!

19:30.294 --> 19:31.670
<i>This time,</i>

19:32.921 --> 19:35.048
<i>I win.</i>

19:36.008 --> 19:37.593
That's not Brayden's voice.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.597
<i>No.</i>
<i>It's another old friend.</i>

19:41.680 --> 19:42.848
The Crooked Man.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.603
But Brayden… Brayden's still in there.
I know he is.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.857
No, hey. Hey, hey, Brayden!

19:51.940 --> 19:56.737
Hey, Brayden, listen to me.
Brayden, y-you're my son's friend.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.449
I don't have friends. I don't have anyone.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.743
I'm so sorry.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.538
The Crooked Man took Dion's dad too.

20:06.622 --> 20:11.001
But to lose your mom and your dad,
that must hurt so much.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.006
You don't know how I feel.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.133
You're right.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.011
But I think I know how your mother felt.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.640
That she loved you so much.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.478
And that she wanted to keep you safe,

20:30.687 --> 20:34.107
and watch you grow up
to be whatever you wanted to be.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.485
<i>She lies. Don't listen.</i>

20:42.866 --> 20:47.037
I think she always hoped to be there
to catch you when you fell.

20:47.746 --> 20:53.794
And she wanted to tell you how amazing
you were when you didn't remember,

20:53.877 --> 20:55.128
because, sometimes,

20:56.713 --> 20:57.756
life is hard.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.509
She left you,

21:02.261 --> 21:04.346
without knowing what would happen to you

21:04.972 --> 21:06.014
without her.

21:07.891 --> 21:13.814
But I'm sure she saw a future for you
where you were creative, and happy,

21:13.897 --> 21:16.566
and curious, and-and you had friends.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.404
And purpose.

21:24.366 --> 21:28.954
And in that future,
you would know that you were always,

21:29.538 --> 21:31.123
always loved.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.422
And that she loved <i>you.</i>

21:45.637 --> 21:46.888
It's too late.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.016
I'm bad now.

21:49.099 --> 21:49.933
No.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.185
It's not too late.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.648
You may have done bad things,
but that's not who you are.

21:58.859 --> 21:59.860
What you do now,

22:01.528 --> 22:02.946
that shows us who you are.

22:20.922 --> 22:21.923
<i>No!</i>

22:24.593 --> 22:26.053
Oh, it's okay, sweetie.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.148
The Crooked Energy. We gotta stop it!

22:40.609 --> 22:42.069
It went into the sinkhole.

22:42.652 --> 22:45.739
It's making more flowers
to infect everyone.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.910
The flowers cause the infection.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.746
Yeah. Yeah.

22:53.246 --> 22:58.168
Suzanne said that the serum
would make the infection destroy itself.

22:58.251 --> 23:01.797
-If I can inject it into the sinkhole--
-Give it to me. I'll teleport down there.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.008
-I can't let you do that.
-You have to trust me.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.177
-I'm the Mind Mover, I--
-Move things with your mind.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.220
But I'm your mother.

23:08.303 --> 23:11.640
It's underground.
You can't get down there, but I can.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.309
You have to trust me. Please.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.652
-Stop.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.367
Dude, are you seriously
threatening me with that thing?

24:12.951 --> 24:14.453
I've got metal manipulation in here.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.914
I can turn that gun into a bracelet
before you can pull the trigger.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.336
I want to ask a favor.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.465
Oh, I didn't realize
we were on favor-asking terms.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.551
Guys like us, we need to stick together.

24:31.636 --> 24:35.891
Let me help you
catalog and master your powers.

24:35.974 --> 24:39.436
Hm. My very own Moira MacTaggert.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.024
I don't know what that means.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.234
Just, uh, keep going, I'm listening.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.784
I want to monitor and track

24:54.868 --> 24:57.913
how the DNA transfer
worked inside your body.

24:58.955 --> 25:00.248
To chronicle the science.

25:01.416 --> 25:05.504
And to try to replicate it
so you can sell it to regular folks?

25:07.214 --> 25:09.674
-We could make a fortune.

25:09.758 --> 25:13.136
And why do I need money,
with all this power?

25:15.597 --> 25:18.725
Maybe someday you'll want
to build yourself an army.

25:21.102 --> 25:21.978
Hmm.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.196
Hello, old friend.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.578
<i>It's time.</i>

25:40.163 --> 25:41.998
I have a few new tricks to show you.

25:43.833 --> 25:44.668
What the hell?

25:46.378 --> 25:47.837
Oh, I'll introduce you later.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.427
I tried to be good.
I really did, but,

25:56.304 --> 25:58.014
you know what? It's hard.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.227
I'm ready when you are.

26:35.343 --> 26:36.303
The roots.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.447
No!

26:55.530 --> 26:56.406
Dion!

26:56.489 --> 26:59.284
No!

27:04.748 --> 27:07.292
Get off me!

27:25.435 --> 27:26.353
Dion!

28:16.277 --> 28:17.153
Dion.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.115
Dion. Where's Dion?

28:29.082 --> 28:30.542
-Dion!

28:30.625 --> 28:33.503
-Mom!
-Oh my God. Oh!

28:37.465 --> 28:39.968
-Are… Are you better?
-Yes.

28:40.677 --> 28:43.304
-I thought I lost you.
-I thought I lost <i>you</i>.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.140
I love you.

28:47.475 --> 28:49.436
Okay, okay, that's enough!

28:57.277 --> 29:00.113
Janelle?

29:00.196 --> 29:02.198
Janelle!

29:02.282 --> 29:03.199
Mom?

29:05.368 --> 29:06.911
Oh my.

29:09.038 --> 29:11.708
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry too, baby. Come here.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.419
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.425
So, about the village, I was--

29:43.156 --> 29:46.910
I should go talk to Brayden.
He just went through a lot.

29:51.039 --> 29:51.915
Mr. Gary!

29:53.500 --> 29:54.334
Hey, Dion.

29:59.422 --> 30:02.509
-What's going on here, man?
-Well, we just defeated some monsters.

30:02.592 --> 30:06.054
And you <i>were </i>a monster,
but it seems like you're okay now.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.516
What? Is Esperanza okay?

30:10.266 --> 30:12.268
Esperanza. The show!

30:14.103 --> 30:15.271
Time to go on.

30:15.772 --> 30:16.981
Any sign of Dion?

30:18.483 --> 30:19.984
-No.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.864
-Are you okay?
-No.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.493
Time to take it home, Effie.

30:28.576 --> 30:30.912
You go and make 'em forget
about Jennifer Hudson.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.081
Let's make 'em
forget about Jennifer Holliday!

30:33.164 --> 30:36.042
Oh, I'm sorry.
Th-That was too far. I went too far.

30:36.626 --> 30:39.462
If it's okay with you,
I'm just gonna show them my heart.

30:43.716 --> 30:45.844
Well, your heart
better reach the back row.

30:59.774 --> 31:03.236
If I don't make it back at all,
you've got to go on with your life,

31:03.319 --> 31:04.404
<i>and be awesome.</i>

33:33.761 --> 33:36.097
-That was good.

33:36.180 --> 33:39.183
Triangle power! Yeah!

33:40.768 --> 33:41.978
Yeah!

33:44.689 --> 33:48.443
Yeah! Triangle power! You did it! Woo-hoo!

33:57.910 --> 34:01.497
I'll have it ready for you by Tuesday.
I promise. You're gonna love it.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.085
Uh, yup,
I'll call you when it's ready.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.211
Hi.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.546
Uh-huh. Bye.

34:12.925 --> 34:16.262
Oh, you are a lifesaver.

34:16.345 --> 34:19.724
No, life-saving is your department.
How's Suzanne?

34:20.433 --> 34:22.226
A little banged up,
but she'll be all right.

34:22.310 --> 34:25.271
-Mad as hell, though.
-"Mad" is not gonna stop Pat.

34:25.855 --> 34:27.106
No. Science is.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.693
We need to figure out how to counteract
the powers he gave himself.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.154
And you think
there's a "command+Z" button?

34:34.572 --> 34:37.283
With gene therapy,
yeah, I think there might be.

34:37.366 --> 34:41.454
Not to mention we haven't seen
the last of these supernatural diseases,

34:41.537 --> 34:43.831
as long as that dark energy is out there.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.794
And you're gonna
do all of that from my living room?

34:48.795 --> 34:49.629
Actually,

34:50.463 --> 34:53.132
Suzanne offered to set me up
with my own lab at BIONA.

34:53.674 --> 34:56.052
Girl, I think I have
finally found my calling.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.221
My amazing sister.

34:58.304 --> 35:01.057
You're the one with the Powered kid, baby.

35:02.433 --> 35:03.309
Speaking of…

35:14.779 --> 35:17.657
If you're gonna ride your bike to school,
you need to leave in 30 minutes.

35:18.157 --> 35:20.284
Thirty minutes. Start the clock.

37:17.818 --> 37:19.028
Let's finish this!

37:20.154 --> 37:21.364
Atlanta is history.

37:31.749 --> 37:32.750
Who the hell are you?

37:33.751 --> 37:38.756
I'm the Mind Mover.
I move things with my mind.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.719


37:43.803 --> 37:45.721


37:45.805 --> 37:47.723
