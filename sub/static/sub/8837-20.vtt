13:02.573 --> 13:04.532
WELL, THEY JUST MIGHT.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.246
WHY? IT'S NOT
JUST ONE CHICKEN.

13:10.414 --> 13:13.249
BUT IT'S THE WHOLE FLOCK
A-PECKING AT HIM.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.418
WELL, IT'S THEIR NATURE.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.795
PLAIN WICKED.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.422
THEY ALMOST PECKED
HIS EYE OUT.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.345
WELL...

13:25.513 --> 13:27.931
WELL,

13:28.098 --> 13:31.601

13:34.814 --> 13:37.315

13:41.904 --> 13:44.531
HOW'S THAT SICK SQUIRREL
OF YOURS DOING?

13:44.698 --> 13:48.827
GOOD. HIS LEG IS
ALMOST LIKE NEW.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.287
HE EVEN EATS
OUT OF MY HAND.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.332
YEAH.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.711
IT'S TIME YOU CAME IN,
GOT WASHED UP.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.213
SUPPER'S ALMOST READY.

14:00.381 --> 14:03.132
ALL RIGHT. I GOT TO
FEED MY RABBIT FIRST,

14:03.300 --> 14:04.968
BUT I'LL HURRY.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.765
MA WAS SURPRISED
I GOT NOMINATED.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.684
NOT MORE THAN I WAS.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.188
WHO WAS IT
PUT YOUR NAME IN?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.607
JOEL AND KENNY.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.527
THEY SAID
THEY'D HELP ME
GET ELECTED, TOO.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.072
I THOUGHT YOU WAS HAVING
TROUBLE WITH THOSE TWO BOYS.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.574
DIDN'T THEY TRIP YOU,

14:27.741 --> 14:29.868
TEAR YOUR PANTS
OR SOMETHING?

14:31.370 --> 14:34.330
THEY DIDN'T
MEAN NO HARM.

14:34.498 --> 14:37.083
HAPPENED MORE THAN ONCE,
DIDN'T IT?

14:37.251 --> 14:38.167
THAT OTHER TIME,

14:38.335 --> 14:41.296
I TORE MY SHIRT
ON A BUSH.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.840
OH, I SEE.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.888
WELL, IT'S TIME YOU GOT
A MOVE ON, YOUNG FELLA.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.307
SUPPER WILL BE WAITING.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.401
POTATOES AREN'T
QUITE DONE.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.779
THAT'S JUST AS WELL.
HE'S GOT TO FEED
HIS RABBITS.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.698
SHOULD HAVE HAD
THAT DONE BY NOW,

15:08.866 --> 15:12.660
BUT HE WAS SETTING
OUT THERE PETTING
THAT LITTLE CHICKEN.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.037
HE TAKES GOOD CARE
OF IT.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.788
NOW, IF HE HAD HIS WAY,

15:15.956 --> 15:19.584
THAT WHOLE BARN WOULD BE
FULL OF SICK STRAYS.

15:23.047 --> 15:26.716
YOU KNOW, I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THAT NOMINATION.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.761
IT'S THE BAGBY
AND TURNER BOYS
THAT PUT HIM UP TO IT.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.347
I HOPE YOU TOLD HIM
NOT TO COUNT
ON WINNING.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.934
NOT YET...BUT I WILL.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.482

15:42.650 --> 15:44.943

LIKE ELMER,

15:48.489 --> 15:50.365

15:50.532 --> 15:53.159
CAN'T KEEP
UP WITH THE OTHERS--

15:53.327 --> 15:55.578
THEY SET OUT TO
PECK HIM TO PIECES.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.537
DOES HE KNOW?

15:56.705 --> 15:58.915
OH, OF COURSE
HE KNOWS.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.542
HE'S SLOW, ELLEN,
BUT HE'S NOT STUPID.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.628
IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO BOTHER HIM.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.088
WELL, IT DOESN'T
BOTHER HIM

16:05.255 --> 16:07.632
THAT HE'S TWO YEARS
BEHIND THE OTHER
KIDS HIS AGE EITHER.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.593
WE KEPT HIM OUT OF SCHOOL.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.845
YEAH, BECAUSE
OF WHAT THE KIDS

16:13.013 --> 16:15.848
AND THAT SPRINGFIELD
TEACHER DID TO HIM.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.645
A BOY DOESN'T TAKE TO
BOOKS IS NO REASON TO
HOLD HIM UP TO SHAME.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.617
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A MISTAKE

16:34.785 --> 16:37.787
TO PUT HIM
IN SCHOOL HERE, TOO.

16:37.955 --> 16:41.749

HE WAS GONNA BE PRESIDENT.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.889
ALL HE NEEDED WAS
ONE MORE ELECTORAL VOTE
TO WIN IT ALL.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.808
THEY USED TO HAVE
SOLDIERS, DIDN'T THEY?

26:42.976 --> 26:44.059
THAT'S RIGHT, DARLING,
FEDERAL TROOPS

26:44.227 --> 26:45.561
JUST TO GET
AN HONEST COUNT.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.896
WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER,
RUTHERFORD B. HAYES
WAS THE NEW PRESIDENT.

26:48.064 --> 26:50.524
IF NELLIE IS
COUNTING, WE COULD
USE SOME TROOPS.

26:50.692 --> 26:53.277
I THINK MISS BEADLE
CAN HANDLE IT ALL RIGHT.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.987
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
CAMPAIGN THIS WEEK,

26:55.155 --> 26:56.238
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.490
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
TO IMPROVE THE SCHOOL?

26:58.658 --> 27:00.492
HAVE 4 RECESSES!

27:00.660 --> 27:01.452
[LAUGHTER]

27:01.620 --> 27:02.578
THAT'S PLAIN SILLY.

27:02.746 --> 27:03.996
I'D VOTE FOR IT.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.582
WELL, I'M AFRAID
THE SCHOOL BOARD
WOULDN'T GO FOR IT.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.583
DO THE
CANDIDATES

27:07.751 --> 27:09.126
KEEP ALL
THE PROMISES
THAT THEY MAKE?

27:09.294 --> 27:11.253
OH, A FEW,
BUT NOT VERY MANY.

27:11.421 --> 27:12.421
ISN'T THAT
KIND OF LYING,

27:12.589 --> 27:14.423
MAKING PROMISES
YOU DON'T KEEP?

27:14.591 --> 27:16.342
WELL, IT'S NOT
KIND OF LIKE LYING,
SWEETHEART.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.302
IT'S JUST PLAIN OLD LYING.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.472
DON'T THE CANDIDATES
CALL EACH OTHER
NAMES?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.057
MOST OF THE TIME.

27:23.224 --> 27:26.018
I COULD THINK OF
SOME GOOD NAMES
FOR NELLIE OLESON.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.854
HEY, NOW, COME ON.
THAT JUST MAKES YOU
ENEMIES, NOT FRIENDS.

27:29.022 --> 27:31.315
I THINK YOU TWO OUGHT
TO GET YOURSELVES
TO BED NOW, TOO.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.650
IT'S GETTING LATE.

27:35.612 --> 27:38.781
I THINK I'LL JUST LIST
THE THINGS I THINK WILL
MAKE THE SCHOOL BETTER

27:38.948 --> 27:39.907
AND MAKE MY SPEECH.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.575
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,
AND DON'T GIVE UP.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.327
REMEMBER, HAYES WON
BY JUST ONE VOTE.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.286
OK.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.371
GOOD NIGHT.
HAVE A GOOD SLEEP.

27:45.538 --> 27:46.372
GOOD NIGHT, PA.

27:46.539 --> 27:48.415

THANKS FOR THE HELP.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.291

27:51.670 --> 27:53.128

YEAH.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.172
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HELP
MORE THAN ANYTHING?

27:55.340 --> 27:58.592
IF OLESON'S MERCANTILE
RAN CLEAR OUT OF CANDY.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.220
GO ON,
GET YOURSELF TO BED.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.472
GOOD NIGHT, PA.
GOOD NIGHT, DARLING.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.305
HEY, ELMER.

28:45.473 --> 28:46.682
WHY, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.934
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO WIN THE ELECTION?

28:49.102 --> 28:50.811
GOT TO GET YOURSELF
TO THAT STUMP OVER THERE,

28:50.979 --> 28:53.147
HOP UP ON IT,
AND TELL EVERYONE
TO VOTE FOR YOU.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.357
NO...

28:55.525 --> 28:57.317
COME ON, WE SAID
WE WERE GOING TO HELP
YOU WIN THE ELECTION,

28:57.485 --> 28:58.360
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.738
RIGHT THIS WAY,
MR. CANDIDATE.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.246
COME ON, EVERYBODY.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.372

29:10.540 --> 29:11.707

MR. CANDIDATE.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.250
YEAH, TELL THEM
WHAT YOU'LL DO
TO GET THEIR VOTE.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.710

WORMS?

29:14.878 --> 29:15.878
Joel: ONE WORM
FOR EVERY VOTE.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.713
HE DID IT BEFORE,
AND HE'LL DO IT
AGAIN...

29:17.881 --> 29:20.466
STAND ON HIS HEAD,

29:26.222 --> 29:27.890
HE'LL SCRATCH YOUR BACK
OR TIE YOUR SHOE.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.391
OR HE'LL DO
YOUR PROBLEMS.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.310
YOU'LL GET A ZERO,
LIKE HE DOES, BUT
HE'LL STILL DO THEM.

29:31.478 --> 29:34.021

DOING?

ONE MORE WORD OUT

40:58.831 --> 41:00.206
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
MISS BEADLE.

41:00.374 --> 41:03.918
I'M NOT RUNNING
FOR NOTHING.

41:04.086 --> 41:06.379
MY PA
DON'T WANT ME TO.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.423
BESIDES,

41:08.591 --> 41:10.550
ME RUNNING
FOR CLASS PRESIDENT,

41:10.718 --> 41:12.260
WE ALL KNOW
THAT'S A JOKE.

41:12.428 --> 41:13.511
[STUDENTS LAUGH]

41:13.679 --> 41:15.680
Miss Beadle: CLASS!

41:15.848 --> 41:17.432
GO AHEAD AND LAUGH.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.768
I KNOW I'M NOT
SMART LIKE YOU.

41:20.936 --> 41:21.895
I DON'T EVEN KNOW

41:22.062 --> 41:25.023
WHAT A CLASS PRESIDENT'S
SUPPOSED TO DO.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.317
BUT I--BUT I

41:27.485 --> 41:30.111
KNOW WHAT'S
RIGHT AND WRONG,

41:30.279 --> 41:31.946
AND IT AIN'T RIGHT

41:32.114 --> 41:34.157
FOR BIG KIDS TO BE
PICKING ON LITTLE KIDS

41:34.325 --> 41:35.617
JUST 'CAUSE THEY THINK

41:35.784 --> 41:38.870
IT'S FUN
TO HURT SOMEBODY.

41:39.038 --> 41:42.832
AND IT AIN'T RIGHT
TO GIVE SOMEONE SOMETHING

41:43.000 --> 41:44.918
TO MAKE THEM VOTE FOR YOU.

41:45.085 --> 41:46.669
JUST BECAUSE

41:46.837 --> 41:49.380
SOME FOLKS GOT
MORE MONEY
THAN OTHERS.

41:49.548 --> 41:53.009
IT AIN'T RIGHT
TO MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE...

41:53.177 --> 41:55.887
OR PUSH THEM IN THE MUD

41:56.055 --> 41:59.599
TO MAKE THEM LOOK SILLY.

42:01.393 --> 42:05.313
MY--MY MOTHER
MADE ME THIS SHIRT

42:05.481 --> 42:06.814
BECAUSE SHE LOVES ME.

42:06.982 --> 42:10.193
YOU PROBABLY ALL
THINK THAT'S DUMB.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.404
BUT THAT'S WHAT'S
WRONG AROUND HERE.

42:13.572 --> 42:17.408
PEOPLE DON'T PAY NO MIND
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S CARINGS.

42:19.495 --> 42:23.206
I HOPE WHOEVER GETS
TO BE CLASS PRESIDENT

42:23.374 --> 42:25.959
SEES TO IT THAT
THE LITTLE KIDS

42:26.126 --> 42:30.171
AREN'T PICKED ON OR HURT,

42:30.339 --> 42:32.674
BECAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT.

42:32.841 --> 42:35.510
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

42:41.517 --> 42:44.561
THANK YOU, ELMER.

42:52.861 --> 42:56.739
MARY, THE SPEECHMAKING
IS OVER.

42:57.866 --> 43:00.702
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A SPEECH, MISS BEADLE.

43:00.869 --> 43:04.080
I WANT TO WITHDRAW
FROM THE ELECTION.

43:05.249 --> 43:08.710
I DON'T WANT ANYONE
TO VOTE FOR ME.

43:08.877 --> 43:11.504
THE BEST PRESIDENT
THIS CLASS COULD HAVE

43:11.672 --> 43:13.256
IS ELMER DOBKINS.

43:18.804 --> 43:21.514
I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT SUPPOSED TO RUN...

43:21.682 --> 43:23.808
BUT YOU HAVE TO.

43:23.976 --> 43:25.810
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT REALLY KNOWS

43:25.978 --> 43:29.272
WHAT A PRESIDENT
SHOULD DO.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.442
I KNOW YOUR PA
WOULD UNDERSTAND.

43:35.195 --> 43:36.571
PLEASE, ELMER...

43:38.157 --> 43:39.365
WILL YOU RUN?

44:01.930 --> 44:05.600
I THINK IT'S
TIME TO VOTE.

44:13.942 --> 44:23.993
ELMER DOBKINS.

44:26.246 --> 44:28.373
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE HAVE A TWO-WAY TIE.

44:28.540 --> 44:31.584
CAN'T BE. WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE 25 VOTES.

44:31.752 --> 44:33.336
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.421
MY BROTHER WENT
TO THE OUTHOUSE.

44:35.589 --> 44:36.839
OH...

44:42.262 --> 44:45.556
Miss Beadle: WILLIE,
YOU DIDN'T VOTE.

44:45.724 --> 44:46.599
NO, MA'AM.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.935
WELL, WOULD YOU MIND?
WE'RE WAITING.

45:08.247 --> 45:11.290
LAURA...

45:17.005 --> 45:19.215
ELMER DOBKINS!

45:19.383 --> 45:20.967
WILLIE,
HOW COULD YOU?

45:21.135 --> 45:22.802
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
PICKING ON ME,

45:22.970 --> 45:25.513
THAT'S WHY, AND
ELMER WON'T LET YOU!

45:25.681 --> 45:27.140
AAH!

45:27.307 --> 45:29.308
Laura:
HURRAY FOR ELMER!

45:29.476 --> 45:31.561
[APPLAUSE]

45:48.787 --> 45:50.037
PA!
PA!

45:50.205 --> 45:51.539
PA, WAIT TILL
WE TELL YOU!

45:51.707 --> 45:53.207
TAKE IT EASY,
TELL ME WHAT?

45:53.375 --> 45:54.375
ELMER WON.

45:54.543 --> 45:56.461
HE SHOULD HAVE. HE MADE
THE FINEST SPEECH EVER.

45:56.628 --> 45:57.837
ELMER?

45:58.005 --> 46:00.339
EVEN WITH
ALL THE CANDY IN
OLESON'S MERCANTILE,

46:00.507 --> 46:01.924
NELLIE COULDN'T
BEAT HIM.

46:07.890 --> 46:10.183
SEE YOU LATER,
ELMER.

46:10.350 --> 46:12.769
YEAH.

46:15.481 --> 46:18.274
EXCUSE ME.

46:52.434 --> 46:56.395
CONGRATULATIONS,
MR. PRESIDENT.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.582
COME ON.

47:16.750 --> 47:21.254
LET'S GO HOME AND TELL
YOUR MA ABOUT THIS, HUH?
