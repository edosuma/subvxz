00:06.635 --> 00:11.549
Gentlemen, I have created...
this thing.

00:17.065 --> 00:20.051
What is it?
- I don't know. Stand over here.

00:20.625 --> 00:22.095
You mean right her... whoa!

00:22.186 --> 00:23.546
Hey! hey! hey!

00:23.580 --> 00:27.934
It works! I am one can
short of a 6-pack.

00:29.322 --> 00:30.359
The lights!

00:30.486 --> 00:32.375
Who is that? Who's here?

00:33.388 --> 00:36.424
That thing I created, it's gone!

00:36.942 --> 00:41.008
Who could have penetrated
my impenetrable fortress?

00:42.076 --> 00:43.683
My hair heater!

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:27.788 --> 01:30.906
Frylock, find out what
kind of acid dissolves meat.

01:30.915 --> 01:32.395
No! Don't do that!

01:32.405 --> 01:34.373
Yes, Meatwad,
that's what we're doing.

01:34.401 --> 01:35.628
That's not what we're doing.
- Frylock!

01:36.720 --> 01:37.909
Look it up on the internet.

01:38.167 --> 01:39.589
Shut up, Meatwad.
- Let go of me!

01:41.237 --> 01:44.884
Go down to the park and step into the
rainbow and you'll be rich with gold!

01:45.173 --> 01:48.720
Forward this to 20 people or we will
burn your brain from the inside.

01:49.158 --> 01:50.737
GO DOWN TO THE DAMN PARK!!

01:51.468 --> 01:53.739
Man, who would be
stupid enough to check this out?

01:53.970 --> 01:56.813
All right, I'm gonna give
this rainbow thing another 5 minutes.

01:56.934 --> 01:58.536
And if it don't show up quick...

01:59.067 --> 02:03.405
then I am going down to the store
and get a hot rod magazine,

02:04.142 --> 02:06.228
'cause they got the chicks
with the boobs on there.

02:06.237 --> 02:10.657
Excellent. Another victim falls prey
to my brilliant e-mail plan.

02:10.882 --> 02:15.675
Soon, we will have enough
treasure to rule all of New Jersey.

02:15.688 --> 02:18.767
Flargin, he doesn't really
look like he has any money...

02:19.113 --> 02:21.214
or a job or a wallet.

02:21.215 --> 02:23.550
Well, I'm sure he has
some decent tennis shoes.

02:23.551 --> 02:26.433
He doesn't even have pockets.
Look, he's wearing sweatpants.

02:26.434 --> 02:30.002
Dingle, engage the rainbow machine!

02:33.588 --> 02:36.252
Yeah, here come the gold!

02:36.364 --> 02:39.290
Aw, look at this now,
I don't see crap in there.

02:39.528 --> 02:42.014
I know this game.
This is how they get you.

02:43.961 --> 02:46.555
Yes, fat man, this IS how we get you!

02:46.562 --> 02:48.652
Hey there, where's the gold there?

02:48.653 --> 02:51.094
Flip-flops? What is this!?

02:51.143 --> 02:54.787
What did I say?
No money, no job, no taste.

02:54.849 --> 02:57.622
How ya doin there, bozo.
Give me the gold.

02:58.126 --> 03:00.836
Aw, Jesus! Don't do that!
- Next time you come to the park, fat man,

03:01.424 --> 03:03.840
you wear your good shoes!

03:05.078 --> 03:08.191
Phew, this sure is relaxing, Frylock.

03:08.348 --> 03:09.644
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?

03:09.785 --> 03:12.689
Master Shake said it would dissolve me,
and then I would get clogged

03:12.721 --> 03:15.442
in the filter, and then
beavers would come and eat me.

03:16.243 --> 03:17.548
But that hasn't happened yet.

03:17.556 --> 03:19.122
Get ready!
- Oh, great.

03:19.132 --> 03:22.902
I'm about to cannonball--
What is THIS?

03:22.975 --> 03:27.185
Hi, Master Shake.
- Meatwad, what are you doing in my pool?

03:27.217 --> 03:29.718
Look, I'm a meat-bouy.

03:29.733 --> 03:33.622
Yes, where you should have a brain
there's a cavity that keeps you afloat.

03:33.718 --> 03:35.888
Isn't that something
to be very proud of.

03:35.894 --> 03:40.927
Look, I have a brain. I just
took it out so it wouldn't get wet.

03:40.933 --> 03:43.456
Yeah, man. He took
his brain out. It's cool.

03:43.620 --> 03:46.599
Well, yeah, but... but wait!

03:47.158 --> 03:51.188
You don't want the werewolf to see
you swimming. He will get jealous.

03:51.221 --> 03:53.651
Now you said...
- Oh, no! What's this...

03:53.652 --> 03:55.872
down here?
- Nooooooo!

03:56.216 --> 03:58.105
Noooooooo!

04:01.960 --> 04:03.162
Did you see that?

04:03.638 --> 04:05.085
You're really sick, Shake,
you know that?

04:05.093 --> 04:06.601
I am the lord of illusions.

04:09.014 --> 04:10.734
Whoa, ouch.

04:10.782 --> 04:11.705
Carl, are you alright?

04:11.718 --> 04:13.816
Oh, my ribs.
- What happened?

04:13.846 --> 04:15.848
I got this e-mail to go to the park

04:15.877 --> 04:18.720
and step inside the rainbow
and I'd get some gold.

04:19.164 --> 04:22.248
Gold? Come on! Let's go get the gold!

04:22.253 --> 04:25.149
Wait. I got that same e-mail, Carl.

04:25.174 --> 04:26.757
Yeah, well don't go, okay?

04:27.048 --> 04:29.675
'Cause that rainbow through me
all over the place and then

04:29.818 --> 04:32.412
some little guy kicked my
head in and took my chain.

04:32.487 --> 04:34.989
And then you got the gold,
so where's the gold? Where is it?

04:35.110 --> 04:38.976
You know what, Shake?
Do go. You'll have fun.

04:39.226 --> 04:43.602
Hmm, it sounds like some sort of
internet pyramid mugging scheme.

04:43.612 --> 04:44.567
Oh, no!

04:44.573 --> 04:50.627
So what you're saying is this is a
mystery and we gotta go solve it, right?

04:52.474 --> 04:55.943
I scheduled this day off over
two weeks ago. I made a memo.

04:56.038 --> 04:59.005
Shake, we need to go down to the park
and find out what's going on.

04:59.154 --> 05:04.283
Uh, this is... Wait! You said
the park? I have a plan!

05:04.331 --> 05:06.747
Aqua Teen Hunger Force assemble!

05:06.756 --> 05:10.622
Watch out y'all. Shake got a plan
to catch all you perpetrators.

05:12.594 --> 05:17.209
Hey, broad, let's date! Come look
behind the tree, sweetie-baby!

05:17.468 --> 05:20.055
Come get the things I bought
for you while they're nice!

05:20.064 --> 05:22.835
What kind of a plan is this?!
- You're absolutely right.

05:22.902 --> 05:25.332
There's no girls here at all,
I don't understand it.

05:25.467 --> 05:28.478
We should of gone to the
dry-cleaners. Chicks love to clean.

05:28.539 --> 05:31.115
Chicks? We're here to
solve a mystery, Shake!

05:31.163 --> 05:34.762
I know, the mystery of
where the women are, right?

05:34.819 --> 05:37.750
Come on, baby. Come behind
the tree and get some sugar!

05:37.828 --> 05:39.374
I'm starting to get a cramp.

05:39.493 --> 05:40.971
Do not move or say anything.

05:40.980 --> 05:43.911
You're scaring away all the babes
with your fluids and diseases.

05:44.281 --> 05:47.978
Look, I want to go back to ball shape.
I don't like being a man.

05:48.011 --> 05:50.142
Well you're never gonna be
a man with the way you act.

05:50.152 --> 05:53.128
What in the hell is that?
Ya know, this whole plan

05:53.146 --> 05:55.356
is just attracting a bunch of goobers.

05:55.357 --> 05:56.370
What do their shoes look like?

05:56.385 --> 05:59.788
Seems kinda stupid doing
this whole thing for shoes.

05:59.804 --> 06:01.657
It's not just for shoes! It's... it's...

06:01.662 --> 06:04.824
Then for what? This
Bananarama tape with no case?

06:04.932 --> 06:07.167
We really scored big on that one,
didn't we, buddy?

06:07.326 --> 06:10.985
You.... shut up!
Just.. just turn on the machine!

06:11.042 --> 06:11.986
Feet.

06:14.397 --> 06:16.650
Look, that's the rainbow
from Carl's e-mail!

06:16.678 --> 06:18.249
You're right, Shake. Good work.

06:18.258 --> 06:19.943
Gold! I'm rich!
- Shake, no!

06:22.336 --> 06:25.223
What just happened?
- That rainbow just took Shake away!

06:25.333 --> 06:29.511
Really, that is awful.
Let's go get some ice cream.

06:29.562 --> 06:31.449
Wait, Meatwad. We need to find him.

06:32.072 --> 06:34.991
And when we find Shake,
we'll find our culprits.

06:35.676 --> 06:37.850
Or we could just get a new roomate.

06:39.426 --> 06:41.776
Look, you go find him.
He don't yell at you.

06:41.865 --> 06:44.932
All I ever try to do is make him
smile and sing around him

06:44.974 --> 06:47.444
and dance around him and
he just lays into me.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.769
He told me to get in the freezer
'cause there was a carnival in there.

06:50.955 --> 06:53.584
There wasn't no carnival,
it was a damn freezer.

06:53.602 --> 06:56.597
I got freezer burn and I got
mushed up against that chicken...

06:56.605 --> 06:57.727
Hang on, hang on a second, Meatwad.

06:57.763 --> 07:01.399
My fry-dar is picking up some
very small brain activity.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.890
<i>Yoo-hoo, I'm rich!</i>

07:02.934 --> 07:05.102
Great, he's alive!
- Damn it.

07:05.103 --> 07:06.901
<i>Rich beyond my wildest imagination. </i>

07:07.016 --> 07:10.346
Get away from that, I call that one.
That pile's mine as well.

07:10.352 --> 07:14.036
No feet!
- Yeah, that's right, ass. No feet.

07:14.045 --> 07:17.795
What is this, a frisbee?
- Get away from our precious treasure!

07:17.847 --> 07:22.945
You call this frisbee treasure? It's bent!
This is crap! Where's the gold?

07:23.042 --> 07:28.692
Good question. I told you we needed
to be doing this in Antwerp, Flargin.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.796
At least they have diamonds.

07:30.806 --> 07:33.615
Well, Merle. You know you don't
have to be part of this plan.

07:33.748 --> 07:36.054
Yeah, but I'm the only one
that looks normal enough to

07:36.078 --> 07:39.260
to go into town and buy us
food. Isn't that right?

07:39.377 --> 07:41.916
Normal?! You're not even Irish!

07:41.922 --> 07:45.592
Look, I told you when we met
that I was not a leprechaun,

07:45.706 --> 07:49.087
that I was from Rhode Island,
and that I was half Korean

07:49.167 --> 07:50.815
and you said it didn't matter.

07:50.825 --> 07:53.804
You're both yo-yos!
Shut up, ya yo-yos.

07:53.914 --> 07:55.329
Get rid of him!

07:55.401 --> 07:59.718
Look here, gnome, I'll save you the
trouble. Screw this. I'm outta here.

07:59.791 --> 08:03.190
Shake, we found you!
- Yes, that's... amazing.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.401
Wait, are those roller skates?
Those ARE roller skates!

08:06.413 --> 08:10.232
Let's go. They don't have nothing.
It's like a flea market threw up in there.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.428
Look, a Bananarama tape!
- That's mine! Drop it where you are!

08:13.475 --> 08:15.898
So you're the ones
sending all those e-mails,

08:16.315 --> 08:17.438
with this laptop,

08:18.019 --> 08:20.642
and then you're using this
rainbow machine to mug people.

08:20.686 --> 08:26.322
They are? That's right, they ARE!
That's why I got here first.

08:26.352 --> 08:30.304
Now you know too much!
Turn on the machine!

08:32.578 --> 08:35.248
You broke it!
- Prepare to die!

08:37.370 --> 08:39.015
Look, we did not do it!

08:39.038 --> 08:40.208
We had nothing to do with it.

08:40.221 --> 08:41.679
That machine was here
when we got here.

08:41.686 --> 08:45.114
In fact, what happened...
- Stow it, pee-wee, I heard it all before.

08:45.335 --> 08:50.798
Just save it for the judge bec...
Is that gold? It IS gold!

08:51.057 --> 08:53.545
You don't need a machine
to make a rainbow.

08:54.521 --> 08:59.821
For rainbows are made of happy thoughts,
and dreams, and chocolate unicorns,

08:59.946 --> 09:05.168
and gumdrops, and licorice sunsets,
and fuzzy gumdrop bears,

09:05.271 --> 09:08.399
and sugar-coated
chocolate gumdrop land.

09:08.445 --> 09:09.688
No way in hell!

09:09.704 --> 09:14.391
So, all we need to do is dream and a
rainbow will come out and capture people

09:14.432 --> 09:16.442
and we can take their stuff?

09:16.460 --> 09:18.922
What?
- I mean, in theory, 'cause we didn't do it.

09:18.932 --> 09:22.473
Wait a second, did you say
you didn't do it?

09:22.784 --> 09:26.291
Cuz that's all I need to hear.
Come on, they didn't do it.

09:26.311 --> 09:27.363
What about all this treasure?

09:27.371 --> 09:30.160
And the laptop, and the e-mails,
and the rainbow machine?

09:30.184 --> 09:31.636
Well what about this chain?

09:32.227 --> 09:35.782
What about it?
- Look, it's glinting in the sunlight.

09:35.797 --> 09:40.075
RUN!!!
- Oh great, now they're gone, Shake.

09:40.157 --> 09:43.471
Yes, they escaped because you
were trying to frame them.

09:43.861 --> 09:45.936
So we need to get back
so I can get this baby

09:46.018 --> 09:48.017
polished up before
the night clubs open.

09:50.614 --> 09:52.268
Come on, we're done.

09:52.270 --> 09:55.176
That's what y'all get when y'all
mess with then Aqua Teens.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.356
Oh good, you're back. Tell me
you got those little green guys.

10:03.368 --> 10:07.717
Carl, those green guys,
turns out they didn't do it.

10:08.838 --> 10:09.645
Oh, really?

10:09.720 --> 10:14.623
And so, this will remain one of the
great unsolved mysteries of our times.

10:14.746 --> 10:17.168
Wonderful. While we're on the topic,

10:17.175 --> 10:21.631
what's that around your little straw
thing there, dangling, like it's yours?

10:21.632 --> 10:23.055
Oh you like it? It's new.

10:23.075 --> 10:26.007
Yeah, I do like it.
I liked it when I bought it.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.929
Then maybe you can answer this for me.

10:28.130 --> 10:31.704
Is it real gold? Because it's leaving
like a little greenish streak on my lid.

10:31.708 --> 10:34.831
SHHH! I'm trying to sleep,

10:34.883 --> 10:37.495
so that the real
rainbow will come and...

10:39.122 --> 10:43.914
The real rainbow! I did it!
I brought happiness and joy to us all!

10:49.215 --> 10:51.972
Wow!
- Ohhh, good.

10:52.873 --> 10:56.439
Well, I gotta go. See ya later.

10:56.978 --> 10:59.970
Oh! The dream house we've
always dreamed about!

10:59.971 --> 11:01.774
No feet! No feet!
- Hang on, Dingle.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.967
Flargen, where's it gonna land?

11:06.477 --> 11:08.647
You heard him.
- Your dead punk! Dead!
