<i>It's Friday, Friday, Friday, on NBC.</i>

01:20.040 --> 01:21.917
<i>By the way, we're for sale.</i>

01:22.160 --> 01:24.594
<i>So come on, folks,
dial the number on your screen.</i>

01:24.800 --> 01:27.155
<i>Then press "one"
to buy the evening news.</i>

01:27.440 --> 01:29.351
<i>Press "two"
for the entertainment division.</i>

01:29.560 --> 01:32.438
<i>Press "three" for actual,
live TV executives...</i>

01:32.640 --> 01:34.710
<i>...who will talk to you
about your fantasies.</i>

01:43.360 --> 01:45.590
Hello. I was wondering...

01:45.800 --> 01:47.313
...if I buy the news division...

01:47.520 --> 01:51.195
...do I get to use Tom Brokaw
any way I want to?

01:54.480 --> 01:56.630
Bryant Gumbel?

01:57.320 --> 01:59.151
You can keep him.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.510
God, for once
I'm actually glad to be home.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.393
A customer
comes in the store today...

02:21.600 --> 02:23.636
Tall, willowy brunette.

02:23.840 --> 02:28.709
Sits down, says she'd like
to try on a pair of size-12 pumps.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.635
So I'm down there, you know,
just doing my job...

02:34.960 --> 02:38.157
...and notice she's wearing
a garter belt, like I like.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.118
And a nice pair of silk stockings.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.193
All the time, she's smiling at me.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.628
All of a sudden...

02:49.840 --> 02:53.469
<i>...she uncrosses her legs,
like in Basic Instinct.</i>

02:57.560 --> 02:58.959
You saw it all?

03:00.200 --> 03:01.792
Yes.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.510
It was a guy!

03:08.760 --> 03:10.591
Oh, Peg. I tell you...

03:10.800 --> 03:13.314
Does this mean
that I'm...? That I'm...?

03:13.560 --> 03:15.471
Gay, Al?

03:16.400 --> 03:18.470
No, Peg. Just because
I was vaguely excited...

03:18.680 --> 03:22.753
...touching a man's calf
and I don't want to sleep with you, no.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.758
I have no doubts about my sexuality.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.871
No, what I was wondering was...

03:27.080 --> 03:30.197
...am I too sexy
for my own good, Peg?

03:31.360 --> 03:33.749
Now, I mean, I don't wanna
turn on men...

03:33.960 --> 03:36.235
...so I come to the expert.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.278
Peg, how do you
make them not want you?

03:43.680 --> 03:46.433
Well, apparently you marry them.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.357
Oh, come on, honey,
it's Friday night. Let's go out.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.788
I hear there's a revival...

03:53.000 --> 03:55.992
<i>...of The Sound of Music
playing downtown.</i>

03:56.840 --> 03:58.671
I'm not gay.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.270
Come on, honey.
Get that toe a-tapping.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.310
I'm not gay!

04:26.320 --> 04:28.356
God, what a day at the diner.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.869
Damn vegetarians.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.628
They're so damn picky.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.877
I mean, they find
one cat's claw in the chopped salad...

04:36.080 --> 04:39.038
And the way they scream you'd think
it was his head or something.

04:39.240 --> 04:43.199
What are they complaining about?
A cat's practically a vegetable anyway.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.509
And if that wasn't enough,
this transvestite comes in.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.188
A really obvious one.

04:51.240 --> 04:55.677
I mean, you could spot him
from a mile off. Those huge calves.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.874
Like anyone wouldn't notice.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.357
He wanted some shoes,
so I sent him over to your store.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.638
I thought you could
use a good laugh, you know.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.471
Honey, you're hurting
Daddy's feelings.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.274
He was attracted to that man.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.874
That wasn't my transvestite.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.469
Mine was a good-looking man...

05:22.440 --> 05:25.000
...and smelled vaguely of hyacinth.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.358
You two can be so cruel sometimes.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.956
I'm not gay!

05:31.960 --> 05:33.837
Daddy's gay?

05:34.800 --> 05:36.518
Yes, honey.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.870
I'm bored. What say the three of us
go down to the male strip club...

05:42.080 --> 05:44.958
...and we can watch Daddy
fight for the guys.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.277
Oh, not tonight, Mom.
I'm too tired to go out.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.913
Well, how could you be tired?

05:55.120 --> 05:57.554
I've been sleeping all day.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.957
How could she
understand what it's like...

06:00.160 --> 06:03.152
- ... to live off the sweat of our bras?
- Yeah.

06:03.400 --> 06:08.554
Yeah, or bending down all day long,
looking up men's dresses.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.199
I want somebody to go out with me.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.628
Well, why don't you ask Bud?

06:20.840 --> 06:24.230
Something's gotta prepare him for
a lifetime of going out with his mother.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.833
I mean, who taught Liberace?

06:28.560 --> 06:32.075
Ask your father,
I'm sure he knows all about it.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.394
I am not gay.
Would a gay man dress like this?

06:36.600 --> 06:39.717
Or endure one moment
in a house this colour?

06:54.960 --> 06:58.157
Excuse me, family,
while I say good night to my date.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.715
Lulu, one for the road.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.916
Good things do come
in small packages.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.876
Well, then you should
have him turn around.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.790
I almost forgot.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.677
Yup.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.913
Did you hear the news?

07:48.120 --> 07:51.078
They discovered a bright, new,
shiny star in the heavens...

07:51.280 --> 07:53.475
...and I do believe it's me.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.312
<i>I hit upon a grand scheme:</i>

07:57.520 --> 08:00.398
I volunteered as a nude model
for an all-girls art class.

08:00.640 --> 08:04.758
Did you have to move around so that
they could do all seven dwarfs naked?

08:07.600 --> 08:09.795
I'll talk to you when I need
a Coke and fries.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.195
But when a girl wants
to draw a nude in positions...

08:14.400 --> 08:17.278
...far too embarrassing for a guy
who cares what people think...

08:17.480 --> 08:20.870
<i>...well, that's when they
come to " Buff" Bundy:</i>

08:21.480 --> 08:23.914
Buttocks for Hire.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.551
- Anything you wanna say to me, Dad?
- Actually, son, I wanna know...

08:29.760 --> 08:32.354
...are you sure that was a girl?
Because...

08:34.880 --> 08:38.554
...just because it looks like a girl
doesn't necessarily mean that it is one.

08:39.039 --> 08:42.395
Dad, did you get lost
and go to the wrong nudie bar again?

08:43.280 --> 08:46.716
How was I supposed to know what
that song " Macho Man" really meant?

08:46.920 --> 08:48.911
Had a good beat,
everybody was dancing.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.475
I thought all the girls
were in the restroom.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.433
You know how girls
go together and everything.

08:59.560 --> 09:00.993
Yeah. Sure, Dad.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.236
You see, what matters here is...

09:03.440 --> 09:07.149
...I'm finally peaking
while you're creaking.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.797
Two old people on the couch.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.877
Oh, sorry, Kel.
Make that three old people.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.153
Come on, everyone, say, " Clapper. "

09:29.440 --> 09:30.839
That is just ridiculous.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.076
I am not getting old.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.312
There's something
terribly wrong here.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.556
My brother's cooler than me.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.115
My aged mother's cooler than me.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.198
Even my new, gay daddy
is cooler than me.

09:45.640 --> 09:49.235
It was just a harmless
calf caress, that's all it was.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.796
Mom, give Dad a wine spritzer.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.228
I'm in a crisis.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.238
I've gotta do something wild.
Something out of control.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.317
Something that reaffirms my youth.

09:58.520 --> 10:02.069
I am gonna fight this
with every breast in my body.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.557
Here we go, son.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.119
Saturday afternoon,
working on the car.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.794
Just like when you
were a kid, eh, son?

10:15.080 --> 10:16.354
Sure is, Dad.

10:16.560 --> 10:19.028
In fact, it's the same exact car.

10:20.160 --> 10:23.197
You know, Bud, someday
this car is gonna be yours.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.678
Thanks, Dad.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.991
Please, please don't paint it, okay?

10:29.200 --> 10:31.475
Yeah. It is cool.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.996
These here are the sleekest,
sexiest lines...

10:34.200 --> 10:36.555
...American engineers
could come up with.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.752
<i>Why just the name itself
bespeaks power and wealth:</i>

10:40.160 --> 10:41.832
" Dodge. "

10:43.360 --> 10:46.716
That about says it all. Check the oil.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.234
Down a quart. Give me an O XY pad.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.753
Yeah.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.717
Gay, huh?

11:10.480 --> 11:12.835
Let's see a gay guy do this.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.197
Al, Kelly didn't go to work today.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.470
Where could she be?

11:30.800 --> 11:32.028
Look what I bought.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.797
Kelly, you can't possibly
keep this motorcycle.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.191
It is far too dangerous,
especially for you.

11:47.400 --> 11:53.714
On a motorcycle, concepts like left,
right, and stop are more critical.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.553
Well, I'm keeping my bike.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.318
It's gonna keep me young.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.516
Kel, it's not a time machine.

12:01.920 --> 12:05.196
And it's not your body,
so keep your hands off it.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.558
Honey, you have to get rid of it.

12:09.760 --> 12:13.230
No one who loves you would want you
to endanger your life like this.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.669
We saw the motorcycle.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.269
We saw the motorcycle
and we rushed over.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.708
Oh, Al.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.832
We couldn't be happier
that you got one.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.634
You know, there are a lot of myths
about motorcycles.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.832
Like that "always wear
a helmet" thing.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.077
But that's not for men like you.

12:36.280 --> 12:40.319
Popping wheelies, going 90
the wrong way on the interstate...

12:40.640 --> 12:43.677
...that's for cool
outlaw guys like you.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.632
Ride like the wind, wild one.

12:45.840 --> 12:50.630
Drive fast, drive often and drive
when you're really, really tired.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.478
Marcie, it's not Al's.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.671
It's Kelly's.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.032
Oh, God, get rid of it.
They're killers.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.310
Give it to your father.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.234
Ride like the wind, wild one.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.950
I'm sorry, but I'm keeping my bike.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.952
How could I take advice
from you people?

13:09.160 --> 13:11.833
I mean, two of you are geeks
and two of you are my parents.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.429
I'll let you decide who's who.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.958
Well, maybe I can be of some help.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.479
After all, Kelly...

13:18.680 --> 13:23.151
...we both live under the rule
of older, dull, parental figures.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.918
But sometimes
the fogies can be right.

13:27.120 --> 13:30.317
Oh, I'm a living witness
to the real horror of the motorcycle.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.397
Yeah. I had a bike once.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.750
Oh, it seemed like fun.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.033
<i>But then, one day I was driving along
when suddenly it happened:</i>

13:39.880 --> 13:45.273
The wind whipped through my hair,
knotting it, splitting my ends.

13:45.720 --> 13:50.748
It was chaos. I had to be airlifted
to a special hair clinic in Switzerland.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.437
My head soaked in conditioner
for three solid weeks.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.868
But on the good side...

14:00.080 --> 14:02.833
...I did get to share a room
with Don King.

14:05.600 --> 14:09.912
Kelly, you are just doing this
as an act of rebellion.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.111
You're feeling old, aren't you?

14:12.320 --> 14:14.709
Well, what you need to find
are some grown-up ways...

14:14.920 --> 14:17.070
...to have fun
and make life interesting.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.874
For instance,
when I'm feeling a little down...

14:20.080 --> 14:23.595
...to brighten my day,
I cut all my hair off.

14:24.840 --> 14:28.549
Then I wait for it to grow back
so I can cut it all off again.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.637
Cut, cut. Snip, snip.

14:30.840 --> 14:34.879
Then I take all the hairs up off the floor
and make little animals.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.508
Okay. As you can see,
we've got quite a life going.

14:45.640 --> 14:50.156
Okay, Marcie, let's go renew
your prescription at the drugstore.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.398
You think this will
make a nice reindeer?

14:59.320 --> 15:02.676
Well, it's been more fun than I can
describe with my limited vocabulary...

15:02.880 --> 15:04.472
...but I'm gonna ride my bike now.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.713
Kelly, honey, you know...

15:07.920 --> 15:11.469
...I rode a few motorcycles
when I was young.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.717
I remember the wind, the speed...

15:14.920 --> 15:16.990
...the vibration...

15:17.240 --> 15:19.071
...the whirring.

15:25.160 --> 15:29.676
Oh, God, if only they made
stationary motorcycles.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.031
How can I make
you people understand?

15:32.240 --> 15:35.596
I mean, having a motorcycle's
gonna open up new vistas for me.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.313
Things you can't do in a car.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.873
You can ride alone.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.196
You can ride in a group
of other motorcycles.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.359
You can ride alone, but go to the place
where the group rode their cycles.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.949
You can go to this place
and talk about motorcycles...

15:48.160 --> 15:50.515
...and then you can get back on
and go home.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.595
Plus, I can't return it, because
I can't remember where I bought it.

16:01.480 --> 16:04.358
You're the king, baby.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.677
Dad, will you help me
crowbar Mommy off my bike?

16:14.920 --> 16:17.070
I must heed the call
of the open road.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.999
I must fly like the beagle.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.748
I'm gonna eat my Trix on Route 66.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.669
Oh, the freedom.
I can ride my bike anywhere, anytime.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.552
Nothing is gonna keep me off of it.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.795
Rain. Daddy, can I borrow the car?

16:38.440 --> 16:39.953
Thank you.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.118
Mom...

16:44.400 --> 16:48.075
Hi, honey. I was just looking at it.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.510
Upstairs, Al. Now.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.196
How could I talk Kelly out of this?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.396
She doesn't listen to me.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.160
I don't blame her.
Nobody does. I'm an idiot.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.471
But I'm not gay.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.318
I'm sensitive.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.954
Yeah, I should've bought a motorcycle.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.788
And I never would have
worn a helmet.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.393
I have a lot to fear
from cracking my skull.

17:25.720 --> 17:29.633
It takes a lot of brain-tongue
coordination to babble, "Size 9."

17:33.120 --> 17:35.236
But it would've been great.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.910
Yeah, but I have all this.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.514
So long, everybody!

20:09.760 --> 20:12.274
Oh, my God! What have I done?

20:16.440 --> 20:18.510
Oh, Daddy, you were right.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.392
The bike is dangerous.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.956
What if it was me?
I could've been hurt.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.591
What, Daddy?

20:31.680 --> 20:32.954
" I won one"?

20:33.360 --> 20:35.510
Nine-one-one.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.755
Here's your gruel, Daddy.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.153
<i>You know, I learned
a valuable lesson:</i>

21:00.360 --> 21:02.828
Motorcycles are far too dangerous.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.473
You're much safer in a car.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.070
I mean, I didn't even feel
any impact when I hit you.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.517
Get this out of the way.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.512
What, Daddy?

21:18.960 --> 21:21.599
Oh, goody, now we're playing pirate.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.551
Where be the gold?

21:26.120 --> 21:28.873
Oh, you're the coolest, Daddy.
And you're so smart.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.469
I mean, you knew that
the only way to convince...

21:31.680 --> 21:33.875
...an impetuous youth like myself
was to show me.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.308
And you did that.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.988
I guess you do love me.
Oh, don't you, you big lug?

21:39.160 --> 21:41.151
Dirty scum.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.073
Mommy? She's out taking care
of what's left of my bike.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.670
Come with Mommy.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.595
The cold garage is no place for you.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.070
When you're done with Daddy,
just put him in the garage.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.831
Well, for once, everybody's happy.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.235
I love you, Daddy.

22:11.305 --> 22:17.292
