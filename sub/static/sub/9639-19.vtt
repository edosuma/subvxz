00:06.660 --> 00:10.220
Hey, Mom. Okay, so you and Dad
crossed over into New Jersey, right?

00:10.370 --> 00:13.530
Then it's official. l'm in charge.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.900
Because what if there was a tidal wave
or something?

00:17.670 --> 00:22.980
l know, l know, l know. But if there was,
then would l be in charge?

00:23.110 --> 00:24.910
Yes.

00:26.350 --> 00:29.720
All right. l'm in charge.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.720
Oh, look, a tidal wave.
Now you're in charge.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.600
Not funny, Alex.
This is my new sweater.

00:40.730 --> 00:43.390
Justin, when you wear it every day
for a week, it's not new,

00:43.530 --> 00:45.120
it just needs a wash.

00:49.840 --> 00:53.710
Okay, l washed it. You're welcome.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.170
Oh, well, have a good day, guys.
l'm out of here.

00:58.310 --> 01:01.580
Alex. Where do you think you're going?

01:01.720 --> 01:05.209
- l'm meeting Riley at the street fair.
- You're not going to the street fair.

01:05.349 --> 01:08.050
And you have to listen to me
because Mom and Dad left me in charge.

01:08.190 --> 01:11.460
Justin, most 16-year-old boys have fun
when their parents leave town.

01:11.590 --> 01:13.560
Being the authority figure is fun.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.460
Now, l've prepared
a wizard-training review sheet

01:16.600 --> 01:20.540
on some spells that l feel
Dad hasn't covered enough in class.

01:20.970 --> 01:23.770
''Murrieta-animata''? l know this one.

01:23.910 --> 01:26.240
lt's the one that makes you think
you're the boss of me.

01:27.540 --> 01:32.110
No. Murrieta-animata is a spell for
making an inanimate object come to life.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.780
Thanks, that's the answer. Well,
l'm done with my review. See you later.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074

02:31.240 --> 02:33.770
And then Jessica Miller
told Marianna O'Shaunnesy

02:33.910 --> 02:36.240
l shouldn't be able to get out of gym
if no one else could,

02:36.380 --> 02:37.780
so then Marianna said that--

02:37.910 --> 02:39.880
- Riley.
- What?

02:40.880 --> 02:43.040
You were staring
at Marianna O'Shaunnesy.

02:43.190 --> 02:44.980
l wasn't staring.

02:45.350 --> 02:49.520
ls it because she's got bigger hips
than l do? Because l think they're fake.

02:50.830 --> 02:55.020
l was just looking, that's all.
Alex, why do you always get so jealous?

02:55.560 --> 02:59.690
Just looking, huh? As in, just browsing?
As in, doing a little shopping around?

02:59.840 --> 03:02.240
What are you in the market for, Riley?
A new girlfriend?

03:02.570 --> 03:04.200
Hey, honey.

03:04.340 --> 03:05.470
You're doing it again.

03:05.610 --> 03:08.840
Honey. Honey.

03:09.550 --> 03:14.180
He's giving out free honey samples.
l mean, come on, Alex, this is crazy.

03:14.650 --> 03:16.550
l don't think we should go out anymore.

03:17.620 --> 03:19.050
What?

03:19.190 --> 03:21.050
You're breaking up with me?

03:21.190 --> 03:23.890
But we're so good together.
l mean, we have so many good memories.

03:24.030 --> 03:28.460
Remember, you, me and the penguins
at the zoo?

03:28.600 --> 03:31.360
- What are you doing?
- l'm acting out our favorite memories.

03:31.500 --> 03:35.330
And then that one time
when we went for a walk.

03:35.470 --> 03:39.500
And then we went down the stairs.

03:39.910 --> 03:41.400
Alex, l'm breaking up with you.

03:41.540 --> 03:44.910
Okay, l'm not a very good mime.
l'll admit that.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.880
No, it's because
you're constantly jealous.

03:48.420 --> 03:51.150
l'm not constantly jealous.
l just really like you.

03:51.290 --> 03:52.950
Well, you have a funny way
of showing it.

03:54.090 --> 03:58.190
No, l don't. l'm constantly jealous.
That's how l show it.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.430
Okay, l'm done with my wizard homework.
Can l watch TV now?

04:04.570 --> 04:07.400
Sit. Let me check it.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.840
Yes. You might wanna look at spell five.

04:16.250 --> 04:17.640
l got spell five wrong?

04:17.779 --> 04:20.269
No, spell five is the only one
you got right.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.839
You're meaner than Dad.

04:21.980 --> 04:23.540
Thank you.
You're dumber than l thought.

04:23.690 --> 04:26.850
Well, then you should've thought
that l was dumber. Now who's dumb?

04:28.860 --> 04:32.060
Okay. You need to think harder
about the murrieta-animata spell.

04:32.190 --> 04:36.130
lf you leave an animated object animated
too long, then it develops emotions.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.620
You mean,
if l turned this doll into a person,

04:38.770 --> 04:40.760
it'd feel bad
about being stuck in the box?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.240
Don't touch that!

04:43.370 --> 04:46.400
That's Calico Woman
in her Legion of the Superladies uniform.

04:46.540 --> 04:49.010
They only made 1000
of these lovely ladies.

04:49.140 --> 04:50.770
lsn't that right, Calico Woman?

04:53.050 --> 04:54.110
So, what you're saying is,

04:54.250 --> 04:58.190
there's 999 other guys
who couldn't get a girl to talk to them?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.280
Don't listen to him.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.630
- Riley broke up with you?
- Yeah.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.400
- But l'm being really strong.
- Well, that's good.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.440
- You want some churro?
- Sure.

05:17.310 --> 05:20.760
Riley used to buy food
and let me eat some of it.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.300
You guys were so good together.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.180
Remember that time
you went to the penguins?

05:29.250 --> 05:32.020
Oh, that did look weird.

05:33.960 --> 05:37.720
Hey, Alex,
l heard that you and Riley broke up.

05:37.860 --> 05:40.230
What do you say you and l go out?

05:40.500 --> 05:46.030
Excuse me, Ken? Hi.
We're going out. Like, right now.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.800
Yeah, l've been meaning
to talk with you about that.

05:48.940 --> 05:52.170
This will only take a second.
Wait for me.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.340
l can't believe Riley thinks l'm jealous.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.780
You know, Riley would be jealous too
if l were looking at other guys all day.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.040
You know what you should do?

06:02.180 --> 06:05.480
You should have an open and honest talk
with Riley to establish trust.

06:05.620 --> 06:08.180
Then you'll have a firm foundation
for the future.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.650
That sounds like something
old couples in their 20s would do.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.300
Then what are you thinking?

06:15.930 --> 06:18.730
l'm thinking l'll find a boyfriend
who's cuter than Riley,

06:18.870 --> 06:21.500
make him jealous, and then
he'll wanna get back together with me.

06:21.640 --> 06:25.440
Yeah. What am l thinking?
We're not in our 20s.

06:25.570 --> 06:27.510
We don't watch the news.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.780
So see any cute guys around here?

06:36.190 --> 06:38.050
l see a lot of cute guys.

06:43.730 --> 06:45.920
Hey, Harper, did you see that booth

06:46.060 --> 06:48.430
where they sell rock families
with the eyes glued on them?

06:48.560 --> 06:49.960
- Where?
- Around the corner--

06:50.100 --> 06:52.120
Did they have any with two parents,
one teenage girl

06:52.270 --> 06:54.030
and a smallish, shriveled-up grandma?

06:54.170 --> 06:55.530
l don't...

07:02.810 --> 07:05.370
Murrieta-animata

07:05.780 --> 07:07.910
That pole hurts.

07:08.050 --> 07:10.210
Well, hello, handsome.

07:10.620 --> 07:13.490
Hello. Hello to you.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.680
Hello. Hello.

07:15.820 --> 07:17.820
l can say hello.

07:18.390 --> 07:20.160
Why can l say hello?

07:20.660 --> 07:21.790
l'll explain that later.

07:21.930 --> 07:25.990
The important thing is,
is l'm Alex and your name is Manny.

07:26.140 --> 07:29.590
Yeah, Manny. Last name Kinn.
Manny Kinn. Okay.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.040
And you're my new boyfriend.

07:31.170 --> 07:32.870
Whoa, this is moving too fast.

07:33.010 --> 07:36.030
- l just got off that pole.
- Let's go.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.550
No.

08:04.170 --> 08:07.940
You know, you look so familiar.
Where do l know you from?

08:08.080 --> 08:12.480
You know, you look just like my uncle.
But they took him away a long time ago.

08:12.610 --> 08:16.210
l mean, that's okay, because it was just me
in the window then for a while.

08:17.020 --> 08:18.780
What did you put in there? And why?

08:18.920 --> 08:20.320
- Why...?
- l don't know.

08:47.880 --> 08:52.250
This is my mom, my dad,
my grandma and me.

08:54.790 --> 08:55.950
Your dad's a pirate?

08:57.190 --> 08:58.990
Oh, my gosh.
One of my dad's eyes fell off.

08:59.130 --> 09:01.320
Nobody move. Nobody move.

09:08.840 --> 09:09.900
What are you doing?

09:12.370 --> 09:15.170
l'm cleaning Calico Woman
because l'm selling her on the lnternet.

09:15.310 --> 09:16.900
Well, her and Man Boy.

09:17.050 --> 09:19.840
Even the box has to be
in mint condition.

09:19.980 --> 09:23.470
Oh, by the way, did you clean your room
or just shove everything under the bed?

09:23.990 --> 09:28.180
Cleaning my room
is shoving everything under my bed.

09:28.420 --> 09:30.890
That's why beds have an underneath.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.320
Think.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.930
Hey, everybody.
This is my new boyfriend, Manny.

09:37.070 --> 09:40.030
Hey, everybody. l can say hello.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.930
Hello. l'm Justin.

09:46.910 --> 09:48.930
Alex, what happened to Riley?

09:49.080 --> 09:51.550
We broke up like an hour ago.
Where have you been?

09:53.050 --> 09:57.040
After grieving over Riley for 15 minutes,
l met Manny and it was love at first sight.

09:57.190 --> 09:59.090
- Right, Manny?
- Right.

10:00.190 --> 10:01.250
No,

10:01.390 --> 10:04.360
l didn't even know what it was like
to feel alive until l met Alex.

10:04.790 --> 10:08.290
Oh, that's so sweet.
You guys make such a cute couple.

10:08.430 --> 10:10.590
Alex, it's like Manny was made for you.

10:10.730 --> 10:13.130
You have no idea.

10:13.270 --> 10:15.290
- Manny, this is Harper.
- Nice to meet you.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.560
l'm looking for an eye.

10:17.170 --> 10:18.760
No.

10:21.840 --> 10:25.570
And my brother Max.
And my older brother, Mr. Russo.

10:26.650 --> 10:27.980
And those are Mr. Russo's dolls.

10:28.850 --> 10:30.110
Found it.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.240
Oh, this isn't my dad's eye.
lt's a button.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.490
Wait, buttons don't have legs.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.320
lt's a bug!

10:42.360 --> 10:43.800
Alex.

10:43.930 --> 10:45.590
Can l talk to you for a second?

10:45.730 --> 10:50.570
l don't know, Manny and l are pretty busy
talking about how l don't get jealous, but--

10:52.610 --> 10:53.700
Sure.

10:58.310 --> 11:00.440
l feel horrible about our breakup.

11:00.850 --> 11:01.980
l was stupid.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.250
l didn't know what it felt like to feel jealous
until l saw you with that guy over there.

11:06.820 --> 11:08.620
His name is Manny.

11:09.090 --> 11:11.960
l prefer to call him ''that guy over there.''

11:15.130 --> 11:17.220
What are you saying?
You wanna get back together?

11:17.370 --> 11:19.100
l would.

11:19.230 --> 11:20.360
Yes.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.430
Well, l don't-- Okay.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.430
Really?

11:26.580 --> 11:29.010
Well, what about that guy over there?

11:29.140 --> 11:34.140
Oh, don't worry.
Manny's used to being stood up.

11:37.020 --> 11:40.010
lt's an inside thing.

11:41.390 --> 11:42.480
Stood up.

11:43.260 --> 11:44.920
You're breaking up with me?

11:45.060 --> 11:46.150
Yes.

11:46.300 --> 11:49.960
And you're okay with it, because
l'm gonna turn you back into a mannequin.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.230
All right.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.390
Garibay-immobilitay

11:57.840 --> 11:59.600
Okay, one more time.

11:59.740 --> 12:01.170
Garibay-immobilitay

12:04.280 --> 12:05.940
Excuse me.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.910
Stay.

12:09.020 --> 12:12.210
Justin, a question
completely out of the blue.

12:12.350 --> 12:15.260
But what's the spell to un-animate
something you've brought to life?

12:15.620 --> 12:16.920
Garibay-immobilitay.

12:19.190 --> 12:20.350
Well, l tried.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.790
So, Manny, this is your lucky day.
You're free to live your life.

12:23.930 --> 12:27.030
You'll do great out there,
a handsome kid like you. Okay.

12:27.170 --> 12:28.690
- You enjoy.
- All right.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.070
You know, that's too bad.
l really liked Manny.

12:31.510 --> 12:35.100
And he wears the same sweater as me,
which l saw on a mannequin

12:35.240 --> 12:37.730
that looked a lot like Manny Kinn.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.180
Manny Kinn.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.510
Manny Kinn.

12:43.650 --> 12:44.740
Mannequin.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.320
Yes, l animated the mannequin
from the store.

12:48.020 --> 12:49.790
God.

12:50.860 --> 12:51.920
What's the big deal?

12:52.060 --> 12:54.360
You can't be using magic
without my permission.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.230
That's complete disrespect
of my authority.

12:56.370 --> 12:58.960
Hey, l tried to change him back,
but it didn't work.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.260
What...?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.930
lf you bring something to life
and it develops emotions,

13:05.070 --> 13:07.130
you can't change it back.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.330
Manny's in love with you.

13:09.010 --> 13:12.610
Don't be ridiculous. He's a mannequin.
He can't be in love with me.

13:13.680 --> 13:18.120
Alex, look, l brought you one flower
for every minute that l've loved you.

13:18.790 --> 13:21.090
Oh, no.

13:23.930 --> 13:25.980
Manny, we broke up,
don't you remember?

13:26.130 --> 13:27.620
You have to stop following me.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.290
l can't, Alex. l'm in love with you.

13:31.030 --> 13:32.090
You get me.

13:32.230 --> 13:35.170
You taught me how to drink from a straw
without poking myself in the eye.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.270
Remember the time l kissed the duck?

13:39.940 --> 13:43.070
But what if someone else got you?

13:43.210 --> 13:45.580
And then you could have
even better times with them.

13:45.710 --> 13:47.840
Really? Do you know that someone?

13:48.480 --> 13:51.250
l think l do. She's a real doll.

13:51.690 --> 13:53.880
She's a friend of my brother's.

13:57.990 --> 13:59.460
More wizard homework?

13:59.590 --> 14:02.150
Dad doesn't even make me
do homework on Friday.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.990
Max, if you put it off until Sunday night,

14:04.130 --> 14:06.160
then l won't be able
to put you kids to bed early.

14:06.300 --> 14:09.270
Have a little quiet time for myself.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.910
What are you gonna do,
light some candles and take a bath?

14:16.480 --> 14:18.840
My quiet time is my quiet time.

14:20.420 --> 14:25.220
Okay, so you're a teenage boy
who drinks tea

14:26.490 --> 14:29.360
and likes to take baths.

14:30.030 --> 14:33.290
Like l'm not gonna tell anyone about that
on the lnternet.

14:33.430 --> 14:36.060
Hey. You get down here, young man.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.790
That's it.

14:55.850 --> 14:57.280
Okay.

14:57.420 --> 15:00.650
Murrieta-animata grande

15:01.620 --> 15:04.820
Oh, those twist-ties really hurt.

15:06.090 --> 15:08.560
Manny, meet Calico Woman.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.000
Calico Woman, meet Manny.

15:11.130 --> 15:14.120
You two have a lot in common.

15:14.270 --> 15:16.760
l don't have anything in common
with a superhero.

15:16.910 --> 15:20.200
You're so wrong, Manny.
Who likes to say hello?

15:21.180 --> 15:22.910
Hello.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.270
Hello.

15:25.980 --> 15:28.140
Who here is dishwasher-safe?

15:30.090 --> 15:33.080
That's the only thing about me
that's safe.

15:37.060 --> 15:41.150
See? You two are gonna be
so happy together.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.220
l'm still in love with her.

15:48.370 --> 15:51.030
When you say that,
that makes me really mad.

15:51.170 --> 15:52.470
Yeah, that's called jealousy.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.570
l don't like that feeling.

15:58.050 --> 16:01.350
There. See? All done.
He's perfectly happy with her.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.110
Now nothing could go wrong.

16:03.250 --> 16:06.020
Oh, l hope l didn't jinx that.

16:06.350 --> 16:09.760
And right after dinner, you have to take
a shower and then get in your pajamas.

16:09.890 --> 16:12.490
Can l take a shower in my pajamas?

16:12.630 --> 16:14.620
Then you would be wet,
your pajamas would be wet

16:14.760 --> 16:16.660
and your entire bed would be wet.

16:16.800 --> 16:20.670
But if everything's wet,
is anything really wet?

16:22.440 --> 16:27.000
Like when you're totally underwater,
you're not really wet.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.740
Yes, you are.

16:33.350 --> 16:35.540
Calico Woman's gone. Where--?

16:35.680 --> 16:40.310
Well...it says right here,
''No chains can hold her.''

16:41.290 --> 16:44.880
Chains are a lot stronger
than a cardboard box.

16:45.030 --> 16:46.150
Alex.

16:46.290 --> 16:48.130
See?

16:48.260 --> 16:50.730
Max! What are--?

16:52.170 --> 16:55.630
Alex, don't leave me.
Look, look, l won you a stuffed gorilla.

16:55.770 --> 16:58.670
All right, enough.
This has gotta stop, Manny. lt's over.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.440
- But l'm in love with her.
- Seriously, it's over.

17:01.580 --> 17:04.700
Otherwise, that pretty face
ain't gonna be so pretty no more.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.940
Oh, no, you're not gonna change my head
into that featureless knob.

17:09.349 --> 17:10.510
All right, that's it.

17:10.650 --> 17:12.420
Wait. Wha--?

17:12.550 --> 17:14.680
Riley, wait.

17:15.690 --> 17:17.250
Manny!

17:17.390 --> 17:20.329
Manny, l love you.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.329
Okay, let's split up and find Alex.

17:24.470 --> 17:27.660
Because where Alex is,
that's where my Calico Woman doll is.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.060
Well, there's Manny.

17:31.510 --> 17:32.970
Oh, and there's Riley.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.710
Oh, found Alex.

17:36.340 --> 17:37.710
Manny!

17:37.850 --> 17:39.210
And Calico Woman.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.740
Man, she is huge.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.320
And alive.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.910
Manny. Manny.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.040
We were both made in China.

18:46.980 --> 18:49.280
We need a volunteer.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.280
Who wants to sit in this dunk tank?

18:54.360 --> 18:56.320
- l'll go in.
- Excellent. Excellent.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.480
Just climb right up there.

18:58.630 --> 19:01.620
Okay, who would like the first shot

19:01.760 --> 19:06.100
at sending this handsome fella
into this dunk tank?

19:07.600 --> 19:09.190
l would.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.830
Riley.

19:10.970 --> 19:12.060
What are you doing?

19:12.210 --> 19:16.200
l'm gonna teach Manny that no one
comes between me and my girl.

19:16.340 --> 19:20.140
l know you don't like jealousy on me,
but on you, it is so hot.

19:25.450 --> 19:27.320
No!

19:27.460 --> 19:28.680
Oh, my God,

19:29.920 --> 19:31.890
Wait up.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.490
- Alex.
- Oh, no, what happened to Manny?

19:37.270 --> 19:39.320
Well, it looks like he got wet.

19:39.470 --> 19:42.700
You know, sometimes
water can make a spell wear off.

19:44.110 --> 19:45.400
How do you know that?

19:45.540 --> 19:48.340
Because the spell just wore off.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.640
Manny?

19:50.780 --> 19:54.220
What have they done to you?!

19:54.580 --> 19:56.450
What's going on here?

19:56.580 --> 20:01.110
Alex, that guy over there
just turned into giant doll pieces.

20:01.260 --> 20:05.060
That's it. l'm calling Waverly Place
Street Fair security.

20:06.430 --> 20:09.730
No, no, no. No need to do that, okay?

20:09.860 --> 20:12.630
l have to tell you something.
l have to tell everybody something.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.460
Ladies and gentlemen, the man
you just saw in the dunk tank is really a--

20:16.600 --> 20:18.870
- Alex.
- Magician.

20:19.010 --> 20:22.240
The Great Manic-keeny.

20:22.380 --> 20:26.110
And for his big trick,
he has disappeared in the dunk tank,

20:26.250 --> 20:31.620
leaving behind
a disassembled mannequin in his place.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.650
Ta-da.

20:36.660 --> 20:39.060
Oh, yeah.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.700
And how about a hand
for his lovely assistant?

20:45.100 --> 20:46.500
Yeah.

20:46.630 --> 20:47.830
All right.

20:47.970 --> 20:50.100
Watch the outfit,
you're going back in the box.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.300
l never liked you.

20:51.710 --> 20:54.830
Hey. Hey. Hey, you get back here.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.840
l thought Manny was just a mannequin
who got turned into a person

21:03.990 --> 21:05.890
and then back into a mannequin.

21:06.020 --> 21:08.420
But he was really just a magician.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.350
Great show. Great show. Great show.

21:18.830 --> 21:21.800
Look, Alex, see what happens
when you break the rules?

21:22.500 --> 21:23.990
Things end up working out for me?

21:25.640 --> 21:27.200
No.

21:27.340 --> 21:30.210
You almost exposed us as wizards
and l lost Calico Woman.

21:30.350 --> 21:31.680
She was worth 100 bucks.

21:31.810 --> 21:35.180
l got my boyfriend back,
and l'll give you 100 bucks. Who got hurt?

21:35.620 --> 21:38.180
l did because you didn't respect me
being in charge.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.490
Why is that so important to you?

21:42.620 --> 21:45.750
What about living? Having fun?

21:45.890 --> 21:47.860
Doing stuff to tell stories about?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.860
Like this.
This is gonna be a great story to tell.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.130
The only people you could tell the story to
would ground you.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.540
lf you'd calm down every once in a while,
l would tell you stories.

21:58.070 --> 22:02.440
Like, l bet you've always wondered what
happened to your lightsaber and cape.

22:04.110 --> 22:08.050
Alex, how am l supposed to be calm
when you tell me stuff like that?

22:11.020 --> 22:14.010
Oh, come on, you grandpas.
Can't anyone dunk me?

22:14.390 --> 22:18.550
You know, it's really hot out here.
l could really use a dip.
