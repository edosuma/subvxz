WEBVTT

00:07.054 --> 00:08.919
Whatever she wants us for,
it better be good.

00:08.989 --> 00:09.921
Bridge.

00:09.990 --> 00:11.582
I had you right
where I wanted you.

00:11.658 --> 00:13.182
What are you talking about?

00:13.260 --> 00:16.058
I was ahead-- 19-7.

00:16.129 --> 00:18.427
I was just lulling you
into a false sense of security.

00:18.498 --> 00:19.430
Sure you were.

00:19.499 --> 00:20.625
I'll win the next
couple of points,

00:20.701 --> 00:22.191
then you'll start to tense up.

00:22.269 --> 00:25.466
I do not tense up.

00:25.539 --> 00:27.234
Easy, B'Elanna.

00:27.307 --> 00:28.638
It's only hoverball.

00:28.709 --> 00:29.937
You wanted to see us, Captain?

00:30.010 --> 00:30.942
Yes, Commander.

00:31.011 --> 00:32.911
We've picked up
an intriguing transmission.

00:32.979 --> 00:33.968
I have a source on the signal.

00:34.047 --> 00:34.979
A ship?

00:35.048 --> 00:36.015
Negative.

00:36.083 --> 00:37.345
It appears to be
a beacon of some kind.

00:37.417 --> 00:38.816
A beacon?

00:40.320 --> 00:41.287
We are being hailed

00:41.355 --> 00:43.186
by someone using
a Federation signal.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.667 --> 02:34.929
How could someone
be transmitting

02:35.001 --> 02:37.265
a Federation signal
from the Delta Quadrant?

02:37.337 --> 02:40.135
Maybe Starfleet found a way
to get a probe here.

02:40.207 --> 02:41.731
Maybe they're looking for us.

02:41.808 --> 02:43.469
I'd like to believe that, too,

02:43.543 --> 02:45.443
but let's not jump
to conclusions.

02:45.512 --> 02:47.002
See if you can
authenticate the signal.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.308
The carrier wave frequency

02:48.381 --> 02:50.975
does correspond to standard
Starfleet security codes.

02:51.051 --> 02:52.018
As of when?

02:52.085 --> 02:53.279
According to the encryption key,

02:53.353 --> 02:54.877
this particular code
was not scheduled

02:54.955 --> 02:57.822
for implementation
until Stardate 48423.

02:57.924 --> 03:00.222
That's a month after we left
Deep Space 9.

03:00.293 --> 03:02.659
They must be looking for us.

03:02.762 --> 03:04.559
Your optimism may be
premature, Mr. Kim.

03:04.598 --> 03:06.031
Sorry, Captain.

03:06.099 --> 03:07.430
But it's also infectious.

03:07.501 --> 03:11.096
Mr. Paris,
lay in a course for the beacon.

03:11.171 --> 03:12.536
Yes, ma'am.

03:19.846 --> 03:22.576
We're approaching the beacon's
coordinates, Captain.

03:22.649 --> 03:25.880
It's drifted inside
an ionized hydrogen cloud.

03:25.952 --> 03:27.715
The cloud's interfering
with our sensor readings.

03:27.787 --> 03:30.017
Can you get any information
from the beacon?

03:30.090 --> 03:31.114
I'm afraid not.

03:31.191 --> 03:32.158
Should I beam it aboard?

03:32.225 --> 03:33.852
I'd advise against bringing it

03:33.927 --> 03:35.554
on board before we've
gotten a look at it--

03:35.629 --> 03:37.290
even if it is emitting
a Federation signal.

03:37.364 --> 03:39.559
Agreed, and I don't want
to fly blindly

03:39.633 --> 03:41.123
into a hydrogen cloud either.

03:41.201 --> 03:43.362
Mr. Tuvok, tractor the probe
into sensor range.

03:43.436 --> 03:44.368
Aye, Captain.

03:44.437 --> 03:45.529
Targeting scanners locked.

03:45.605 --> 03:46.572
Initiating tractor beam.

03:47.574 --> 03:48.632
Report.

03:48.708 --> 03:50.642
We are taking fire
from inside the cloud.

03:50.710 --> 03:51.642
Source?

03:51.711 --> 03:52.643
Unknown.

03:52.712 --> 03:53.701
Battle stations.

04:03.557 --> 04:06.355
A Kazon raider is closing
at 158 mark 9.

04:06.426 --> 04:07.950
Hail them, Mr. Kim.

04:09.062 --> 04:10.427
They're not responding, Captain.

04:10.497 --> 04:12.692
Warp 3, Mr. Paris.
Get us out of here.

04:12.766 --> 04:13.755
Aye...

04:15.235 --> 04:17.202
Warp engines are off-line,
Captain.

04:17.269 --> 04:19.101
Initiate evasive pattern
omega three.

04:19.172 --> 04:20.833
Mr. Tuvok, return fire.

04:20.906 --> 04:22.238
Aye, Captain.

04:23.843 --> 04:25.572
Kazon ship is in pursuit.

04:25.645 --> 04:28.478
An opening is forming
in the starboard shields,

04:28.548 --> 04:29.708
72 centimeters in diameter.

04:29.816 --> 04:31.579
See if you can close it,
Commander.

04:31.651 --> 04:33.175
Try rotating
the shield harmonics.

04:35.922 --> 04:37.219
They are continuously

04:37.290 --> 04:39.884
matching their weapons frequency
to our shield frequency.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.928
How the hell can they do that?

04:41.995 --> 04:43.257
I don't know.

04:43.330 --> 04:44.592
The diameter of the opening
has widened

04:44.664 --> 04:45.653
to approximately two meters.

04:45.732 --> 04:47.757
Set the shield harmonics
to rotate continuously.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.165
Aye, Commander.

04:49.235 --> 04:51.203
The diameter

04:51.271 --> 04:53.205
of the opening is now
approximately four meters.

04:53.273 --> 04:54.934
It's as if they know
our access codes.

04:55.008 --> 04:57.340
Captain, I am picking up
a smaller vessel

04:57.410 --> 04:58.775
emerging
from the hydrogen cloud.

04:58.878 --> 04:59.902
It is heading directly

04:59.980 --> 05:01.277
toward the opening
in our shields.

05:01.348 --> 05:03.612
All hands, brace for impact.

05:22.435 --> 05:26.496
Warning. Hull breach
on Deck 4, Cargo Bay 2.

05:26.573 --> 05:30.009
Structural integrity is
at 50 percent and dropping.

05:30.076 --> 05:32.374
The hull is starting to buckle.

05:32.445 --> 05:34.436
We're losing life support
on Deck 4.

05:34.514 --> 05:37.506
I am trying to initiate
an emergency containment field.

05:37.584 --> 05:38.710
However, the collision

05:38.818 --> 05:40.809
has caused a power failure
on Deck 4.

05:40.887 --> 05:43.151
Rerouting power to compensate.

05:44.691 --> 05:46.022
Containment field activated.

05:46.092 --> 05:49.493
Warning. Intruder alert
in Cargo Bay 2.

05:49.562 --> 05:51.223
Mr. Tuvok!

05:51.297 --> 05:52.594
Tuvok to Security.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.224
Meet me outside Cargo Bay 2.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.267
Aye, sir.

06:01.174 --> 06:02.903
Drop your weapons!

06:14.988 --> 06:15.955
It's no use.

06:16.022 --> 06:17.489
We're not going anywhere
with that shuttle

06:17.557 --> 06:18.524
sticking out of our side.

06:18.591 --> 06:20.024
It's totally destabilizing
our warp field.

06:20.093 --> 06:21.185
Mr. Kim,

06:21.261 --> 06:23.695
did you reroute power
to Transporter Room 2?

06:23.797 --> 06:24.957
No, sir.

06:25.031 --> 06:26.862
Bridge to Tuvok.

06:26.933 --> 06:28.127
Tuvok here.

06:28.201 --> 06:30.499
There may be intruders
in Transporter Room 2.

06:30.570 --> 06:31.537
I'm on my way.

06:49.489 --> 06:50.956
Tuvok to Bridge.

06:51.024 --> 06:51.991
Go ahead.

06:52.058 --> 06:53.355
The Kazon have beamed away,
Captain,

06:53.426 --> 06:55.417
and they've taken one of our
transporter modules with them.

06:55.495 --> 06:56.519
Can you lock on

06:56.596 --> 06:58.154
to the module and beam it back?

06:58.231 --> 06:59.198
Not at the moment.

06:59.265 --> 07:00.698
As soon as the Kazon
dematerialized,

07:00.767 --> 07:02.394
we lost all transporter power.

07:02.469 --> 07:05.267
Mr. Chakotay, lock a tractor
beam on to their ship.

07:05.338 --> 07:06.828
They're not leaving
with that module.

07:06.906 --> 07:08.464
Aye, Captain.

07:08.541 --> 07:10.532
The Kazon are powering
their warp engines, Captain.

07:10.610 --> 07:11.542
Make it fast, Commander.

07:11.611 --> 07:13.135
Engaging tractor beam.

07:13.213 --> 07:14.874
I've got them, Captain.

07:14.948 --> 07:17.314
The Kazon ship is hailing us.

07:17.383 --> 07:19.180
Suddenly they want to talk.

07:19.252 --> 07:20.412
On screen.

07:20.887 --> 07:23.856
Captain Janeway.

07:23.923 --> 07:26.790
First Maje Culluh
of the Kazon-Nistrim.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.055
I remember you, Culluh.

07:29.129 --> 07:31.495
That transporter module
you just stole

07:31.564 --> 07:33.657
is specifically designed
for our ship.

07:33.733 --> 07:35.360
You'll never be able
to integrate it

07:35.435 --> 07:36.697
into your systems.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.965
I've had some help
updating our technology

07:39.038 --> 07:40.938
since we last met.

07:48.281 --> 07:49.248
Seska?

07:49.315 --> 07:50.646
That's right, Captain.

07:50.717 --> 07:52.344
As you can see,
I'm in the process

07:52.418 --> 07:55.148
of restoring
my Cardassian physiology.

07:57.290 --> 07:59.417
Hello, Chakotay.

07:59.492 --> 08:01.756
I should have known
you were involved.

08:01.828 --> 08:04.160
Yes, you should have.

08:04.230 --> 08:07.393
Just like I knew you'd try
to stop us with a tractor beam.

08:07.467 --> 08:10.368
You've always been
so predictable.

08:11.838 --> 08:15.501
Captain, their deflector shields
are creating a feedback loop.

08:15.575 --> 08:17.372
It's neutralizing
the tractor emitter.

08:17.443 --> 08:19.274
Attempting to compensate.

08:19.345 --> 08:21.245
Good-bye, Chakotay.

08:21.314 --> 08:23.908
Lovely to see you again.

08:24.717 --> 08:26.810
It's too late.

08:26.886 --> 08:28.353
They've gone to warp.

08:35.929 --> 08:38.557
They modified the bow
to puncture our hull.

08:38.631 --> 08:42.361
I've never seen the Kazon
do anything like this before.

08:42.434 --> 08:45.598
Until now, the Kazon
have never had an advisor

08:45.672 --> 08:48.300
with Cardassian, Maquis
and Starfleet

08:48.374 --> 08:49.341
tactical experience.

08:49.409 --> 08:50.899
The question is:
How do we dislodge it

08:50.977 --> 08:52.410
without losing
structural integrity?

08:52.478 --> 08:54.139
With power down,
our containment field's

08:54.214 --> 08:55.579
already extremely unstable.

08:55.648 --> 08:57.343
We'll have to reroute
additional power

08:57.417 --> 08:58.543
to the containment field

08:58.618 --> 09:00.245
and tow their shuttle out
with one of our own.

09:00.286 --> 09:01.810
Then we can repair the breach.

09:01.855 --> 09:04.289
The shields and the warp drive
will have to wait.

09:04.357 --> 09:05.847
Warp drive isn't going
to do us much good

09:05.925 --> 09:07.586
with this knife
stuck in our belly.

09:07.660 --> 09:08.592
Get it out fast.

09:08.695 --> 09:09.627
We don't want the Kazon

09:09.696 --> 09:11.391
to put too much
distance between us.

09:11.464 --> 09:13.022
Forgive me, Captain,

09:13.099 --> 09:15.090
but are you sure
going after the Nistrim

09:15.168 --> 09:16.760
is the wisest course of action?

09:16.836 --> 09:18.861
After what they've
already done to us?

09:18.938 --> 09:20.963
Let me make something
very clear.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.339
The Nistrim are in possession
of Federation technology.

09:24.410 --> 09:26.344
That is
an unacceptable situation.

09:26.412 --> 09:30.644
Even though all they've stolen
is a small computer component?

09:30.717 --> 09:32.207
That "small component"
has the potential

09:32.285 --> 09:34.685
to cause vast problems
in this Quadrant.

09:34.754 --> 09:37.689
You're our resident
expert on the Kazon.

09:37.790 --> 09:39.883
What do you think the
other sects will do

09:39.959 --> 09:42.792
when they realize the Nistrim
have transporter capabilities?

09:42.862 --> 09:44.921
They'll try to get it for
themselves any way they can.

09:44.998 --> 09:46.056
You're right.

09:46.132 --> 09:48.464
It could alter the balance
of power among the sects.

09:48.534 --> 09:50.525
Exactly, and it is our duty

09:50.603 --> 09:52.503
to do everything we can,
no matter how dangerous

09:52.572 --> 09:54.096
to stop that from happening.

09:54.173 --> 09:55.697
You can count on me, Captain.

09:55.775 --> 09:57.868
From the look
of these sensor readings,

09:57.944 --> 09:59.935
Seska wants us
to come after her.

10:00.013 --> 10:01.446
Commander?

10:01.514 --> 10:04.381
I think Seska's leading us
into another trap.

10:04.450 --> 10:05.712
She masterminded

10:05.818 --> 10:07.183
a precision raid
that made us look

10:07.253 --> 10:08.584
Iike first-year
Academy students,

10:08.655 --> 10:11.089
but she left a warp trail
for us to follow.

10:11.157 --> 10:13.091
After such
a flawless performance,

10:13.159 --> 10:14.751
why would she suddenly make

10:14.827 --> 10:16.124
that kind of mistake?

10:16.195 --> 10:17.924
You think she wants more
than the transporter?

10:19.065 --> 10:20.999
Are you suggesting
we don't follow her?

10:21.067 --> 10:22.466
No, I agree
with everything you said

10:22.535 --> 10:24.662
about preventing
the spread of our technology,

10:24.737 --> 10:27.638
but conventional tactics
aren't going to work with Seska.

10:27.707 --> 10:29.732
We'll need to come at her
with a few surprises of our own.

10:29.809 --> 10:31.936
I'm open to suggestions.

10:32.011 --> 10:33.638
Perhaps Commander Chakotay

10:33.713 --> 10:35.772
could use
his intimate knowledge of Seska

10:35.848 --> 10:36.940
to manipulate her

10:37.016 --> 10:39.075
in much the same way
she manipulated us.

10:44.223 --> 10:45.713
It can move people
great distances

10:45.792 --> 10:47.885
in the blink of an eye, Haron,

10:47.961 --> 10:52.728
but this "transporter"
is only the beginning.

10:52.799 --> 10:54.232
Go on.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.324
I'm listening.

10:55.401 --> 10:58.529
There is a ship filled
with new technology.

10:58.604 --> 11:01.437
Devices that can make food,
water--

11:01.507 --> 11:04.271
even weapons--
appear out of thin air.

11:04.344 --> 11:08.178
A computer system which uses
neural tissue that can react

11:08.247 --> 11:10.112
twice as fast ours.

11:10.183 --> 11:12.310
Very interesting, Culluh,

11:12.385 --> 11:15.081
but what does all this
have to do with me?

11:16.289 --> 11:19.554
That ship is on its way here.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.787
Help us,
and we can divide the spoils.

11:32.372 --> 11:33.339
The module Seska stole

11:33.406 --> 11:35.636
contains a quantum
resonance oscillator.

11:35.708 --> 11:39.371
So, we modify this coil scanner
to detect the oscillator.

11:39.445 --> 11:41.276
Then we get close enough
to beam it back.

11:41.347 --> 11:42.644
I'm betting Seska's
figured out a way

11:42.715 --> 11:44.910
to shield the module
from our transporters.

11:44.984 --> 11:47.316
We might have
to destroy it instead.

11:47.387 --> 11:48.649
How do we do that?

11:48.721 --> 11:51.383
We borrow a trick
from Seska's book.

11:51.457 --> 11:53.220
Remember how we disabled
the computer core

11:53.292 --> 11:55.590
on the Cardassian frigate
orbiting Bajor?

11:55.661 --> 11:58.687
Seska modified
an antiproton beam

11:58.765 --> 12:00.392
to penetrate
its shields and hull.

12:00.466 --> 12:01.455
Exactly.

12:01.534 --> 12:02.933
But if I remember correctly,

12:03.002 --> 12:06.233
the beam was only effective
from an extremely close range.

12:06.305 --> 12:08.205
How do we get near enough
to the Nistrim ship?

12:08.274 --> 12:10.174
One thing at a time.

12:11.944 --> 12:14.071
You're taking this all very
personally, aren't you?

12:14.147 --> 12:15.444
Why shouldn't l?

12:15.515 --> 12:18.609
You are not responsible
for what happened.

12:18.684 --> 12:21.983
Oh, no?
I let her join the Maquis.

12:22.055 --> 12:23.716
I took her into my confidence.

12:23.790 --> 12:26.258
I even got...

12:26.325 --> 12:28.293
intimately involved with her.

12:28.361 --> 12:31.125
So you have
lousy taste in women.

12:31.197 --> 12:35.133
Look, Chakotay,
she fooled us all.

12:35.201 --> 12:37.863
She was my best friend--

12:37.937 --> 12:40.132
or at least
that's what I thought.

12:40.206 --> 12:43.403
Well, l, for one, am through
being manipulated by her.

12:43.476 --> 12:45.205
Are you sure?

12:45.278 --> 12:47.610
Because she's affecting you.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.547
That's just where she wants you.

12:50.616 --> 12:53.414
Don't tense up.

12:56.556 --> 12:57.784
So now I'm getting advice

12:57.857 --> 13:00.291
about controlling
my emotions from you.

13:04.030 --> 13:08.194
Our sects have been
blood enemies for generations.

13:08.267 --> 13:12.363
And yet, now you ask for my help
to defeat this Voyager.

13:12.438 --> 13:14.838
Why not simply do it yourselves?

13:14.907 --> 13:16.431
I'll tell you why.

13:16.509 --> 13:19.000
Because the Nistrim are weak

13:19.078 --> 13:21.979
and the Relora are strong.

13:22.048 --> 13:26.348
Your grandfather's time
has passed, Culluh.

13:26.419 --> 13:30.446
You've presided over the demise
of your own sect, whittled away

13:30.523 --> 13:32.286
-your strength...
-Enough!

13:35.928 --> 13:39.887
You may have ships
and soldiers,

13:39.966 --> 13:43.527
but I have the technology.

13:45.872 --> 13:47.430
And I congratulate you

13:47.507 --> 13:50.271
on the daring and cunning
of your raid.

13:50.343 --> 13:55.303
Now, why don't you give me
this transporter technology--

13:55.381 --> 13:57.076
assuming it's authentic--

13:57.150 --> 14:00.347
and let the Relora do
what we do best.

14:00.419 --> 14:02.387
When we have defeated
the Voyager,

14:02.455 --> 14:05.424
we will not forget
the Nistrim's assistance.

14:05.491 --> 14:08.289
You think I'm a fool.

14:08.361 --> 14:15.062
I won't hand this
technology over to you.

14:15.134 --> 14:18.035
Then perhaps we
will have to take it.

14:20.006 --> 14:23.373
Why don't we let the maje
go back to his ship

14:23.442 --> 14:25.342
while we consider his offer?

14:25.411 --> 14:28.312
Listen to your woman,
Culluh.

14:40.026 --> 14:41.050
I'm picking up a gap

14:41.127 --> 14:43.095
in the Nistrim's warp trail,
Captain.

14:43.162 --> 14:45.255
All stop.
Let's take a look.

14:45.331 --> 14:47.231
Captain, I've got
some floating debris

14:47.300 --> 14:49.234
at bearing 319 mark 4.

14:49.302 --> 14:50.735
On screen.

14:52.104 --> 14:53.537
What is it?

14:53.606 --> 14:55.198
I'm not sure yet.

14:55.274 --> 14:56.400
Magnify.

15:06.786 --> 15:09.778
I'm detecting a residual
transporter signature.

15:09.855 --> 15:12.881
There is no doubt that this man
and his unfortunate companion

15:12.959 --> 15:14.017
were beamed into space.

15:14.093 --> 15:16.061
And according
to these readings,

15:16.128 --> 15:17.857
they were alive
at the time, Captain.

15:17.930 --> 15:20.330
It looks like Seska's
already adapted

15:20.399 --> 15:22.833
the transporter module
into the Kazon systems

15:22.902 --> 15:24.699
and started
experimenting with it.

15:24.770 --> 15:25.930
Her early trials

15:26.005 --> 15:28.974
appear to have been
less than successful.

15:29.041 --> 15:33.034
I'm not so sure these men died
by accident, Captain.

15:33.112 --> 15:35.478
You see this green band
he's wearing?

15:35.548 --> 15:39.712
It means he was the First Maje
of the Kazon-Relora.

15:39.819 --> 15:41.116
Relora?

15:41.187 --> 15:43.212
Sworn enemies of the Nistrim.

15:44.624 --> 15:47.855
It's conceivable
that Seska and Culluh

15:47.927 --> 15:51.556
used the transporter
to execute these men.

15:55.935 --> 16:00.201
Captain's Log, Stardate 49208.5.

16:00.273 --> 16:02.400
I have convened a meeting
of the senior staff

16:02.508 --> 16:04.806
to determine how we can get
close enough

16:04.844 --> 16:07.836
to the Nistrim ship
to deploy the antiproton beam.

16:10.149 --> 16:11.548
Where's Chakotay?

16:11.617 --> 16:12.549
He was in Engineering

16:12.618 --> 16:13.949
helping me modify
the coil scanner.

16:14.020 --> 16:15.248
He said he'd be right up.

16:15.321 --> 16:16.447
Janeway to Chakotay.

16:17.990 --> 16:19.651
Computer, locate
Commander Chakotay.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.454
Commander Chakotay
is not aboard the ship.

16:32.238 --> 16:34.672
Computer, when will we intercept
the Kazon vessel?

16:34.740 --> 16:36.674
Approximately 30 minutes.

16:41.213 --> 16:42.646
What I want to know, Mr. Tuvok,

16:42.715 --> 16:44.512
is how he was able to get
a shuttlecraft off this ship

16:44.583 --> 16:46.380
without either of us
knowing about it.

16:46.452 --> 16:49.319
Apparently, he was able to
override the lock-out command.

16:49.388 --> 16:50.685
I guess Seska's not the only one

16:50.756 --> 16:53.122
who knows how to compromise
our security systems.

16:53.192 --> 16:55.422
I assure you, Captain,
it will not happen again.

16:55.494 --> 16:56.756
See that it doesn't.

16:56.862 --> 16:59.296
Did Chakotay leave any clue
about what he's up to?

16:59.365 --> 17:01.265
I have accessed
his personal logs,

17:01.367 --> 17:02.959
but there is no reference
to his leaving Voyager.

17:03.002 --> 17:05.367
I guess he was in too big
a hurry to leave a note.

17:05.438 --> 17:06.734
The coil scanner was right here.

17:06.806 --> 17:07.829
He must have taken it with him.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.509
Then I guess it's pretty
clear he's going after Seska.

17:11.577 --> 17:12.509
Looks like that.

17:12.578 --> 17:13.943
You were working
with him, Lieutenant.

17:14.012 --> 17:15.241
Did he say anything to you?

17:15.314 --> 17:17.281
Just that he felt responsible

17:17.349 --> 17:19.214
for Seska,
and was determined to stop her,

17:19.285 --> 17:21.981
but I never thought he
would try to do this alone.

17:22.054 --> 17:23.521
How big a head start
does he have?

17:23.589 --> 17:25.113
Approximately three hours.

17:25.191 --> 17:26.317
Janeway to Conn.

17:26.392 --> 17:27.381
Paris here, Captain.

17:27.460 --> 17:28.586
Lay in a pursuit course

17:28.661 --> 17:30.686
for Commander Chakotay's
shuttlecraft, maximum impulse.

17:30.763 --> 17:31.695
Acknowledged.

17:31.764 --> 17:33.823
And Mr. Tuvok,
I want a complete review

17:33.899 --> 17:36.697
of all security protocols
on this ship by 2200 hours.

17:36.769 --> 17:39.033
Aye, Captain.

17:43.209 --> 17:45.006
You said the Relora
would join us.

17:45.077 --> 17:46.908
I should never
have listened to you.

17:46.979 --> 17:50.039
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.

17:50.116 --> 17:52.812
Kazon sects do not
help one another.

17:52.885 --> 17:55.217
Don't be so sure about that.

17:55.287 --> 17:56.879
What did you do

17:56.956 --> 17:58.423
to the two men
who refused your offer?

17:58.491 --> 17:59.458
I killed them.

17:59.525 --> 18:02.619
Yes, and by doing that,
you sent a message.

18:02.728 --> 18:05.196
"The Kazon-Nistrim
are powerful again.

18:05.264 --> 18:07.732
"First Maje Jal Culluh
has technology

18:07.800 --> 18:09.859
"that no other sect possesses.

18:09.935 --> 18:13.632
Join with him
or suffer the consequences."

18:13.706 --> 18:16.641
Maybe the mistake was
to approach the Relora.

18:16.742 --> 18:18.334
They're already strong.

18:18.411 --> 18:21.380
But the transporter
may be enough

18:21.447 --> 18:24.041
to convince
the Hobii to join me,

18:24.116 --> 18:25.606
and perhaps the Mostral.

18:25.684 --> 18:27.015
Yes,

18:27.086 --> 18:29.384
and with a few more ships,
you can defeat Voyager.

18:29.455 --> 18:31.855
And when you have
the rest of their technology,

18:31.924 --> 18:33.357
the other sects
will have no choice

18:33.426 --> 18:35.189
but to fall into line.

18:35.261 --> 18:37.695
That's why I sent
a subspace message

18:37.763 --> 18:41.290
to the Mostral
the Hobii and the Oglamar.

18:41.367 --> 18:42.459
You did what?

18:42.535 --> 18:45.231
I told them
about the transporter.

18:45.304 --> 18:46.771
Asked them to help us
take Voyager.

18:47.973 --> 18:50.066
You have gone too far.

18:50.142 --> 18:52.440
I sent the messages
in your name.

18:52.511 --> 18:54.536
I am the leader of this sect.

18:54.613 --> 18:57.309
You are only a woman.

18:57.383 --> 18:58.850
I'm sorry, Culluh.

18:58.918 --> 19:01.352
You will address me as Maje!

19:01.420 --> 19:03.888
Yes... Maje.

19:05.090 --> 19:07.854
Please...

19:07.927 --> 19:08.985
forgive me.

19:11.530 --> 19:13.828
So...

19:13.899 --> 19:19.394
how did the other sects
respond to my request?

19:19.472 --> 19:21.872
They're on their way to join us.

19:23.909 --> 19:26.503
I could do what no one has done

19:26.579 --> 19:29.241
since Jal Sankur
united the sects

19:29.315 --> 19:30.612
to overthrow the Trabe.

19:30.683 --> 19:31.650
Yes, Maje.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.048
I could have hundreds of ships

19:34.119 --> 19:36.610
and thousands of soldiers
under my command.

19:36.689 --> 19:38.418
Yes, Maje.

19:38.491 --> 19:42.427
I could be the most
powerful Kazon in the Quadrant.

19:42.495 --> 19:44.895
Yes, Maje.

19:57.142 --> 19:58.871
Come in.

19:58.944 --> 20:01.139
Do you have a minute, Captain?

20:01.213 --> 20:02.305
It's about Chakotay.

20:02.381 --> 20:03.712
That's not exactly
my favorite subject

20:03.782 --> 20:04.714
right now, Lieutenant.

20:04.783 --> 20:06.512
Well, I thought that
maybe I could explain...

20:06.585 --> 20:08.348
Explain what?
Why my First Officer

20:08.420 --> 20:09.648
publicly defied my authority

20:09.722 --> 20:11.713
by commandeering a shuttle
without permission?

20:11.857 --> 20:14.155
I know it was never
his intention to defy you.

20:14.226 --> 20:15.591
He respects your authority.

20:15.661 --> 20:16.628
But...?

20:16.695 --> 20:18.219
But he's a very proud man,

20:18.297 --> 20:20.265
and he's been...

20:20.332 --> 20:22.766
embarrassed by Seska.

20:22.868 --> 20:25.063
What Seska did,
she did to all of us.

20:25.137 --> 20:26.729
Frankly, I find it

20:26.805 --> 20:28.932
more than a little
self-indulgent of Chakotay

20:29.008 --> 20:30.771
to assume this is all about him.

20:32.811 --> 20:35.780
He never said it
to me directly, but...

20:38.951 --> 20:40.942
I think he was
in love with her,

20:41.020 --> 20:43.181
and then he found out
that everything he knew

20:43.255 --> 20:45.189
about her was a lie.

20:45.257 --> 20:49.250
You said that he publicly
defied your authority.

20:49.328 --> 20:51.125
Can you imagine what
it must have been like

20:51.196 --> 20:52.925
for someone
as private as Chakotay

20:52.998 --> 20:57.128
to be publicly humiliated
by someone he loved?

20:57.202 --> 20:58.965
And then, as if
that weren't enough,

20:59.038 --> 21:00.164
she came back to taunt him

21:00.239 --> 21:01.706
in front
of the entire Bridge crew.

21:01.807 --> 21:04.275
I'm sure it was
very painful for him,

21:04.310 --> 21:05.641
but what you're saying is

21:05.711 --> 21:07.338
he's got a personal score
to settle.

21:07.413 --> 21:09.244
That's only part of it.

21:09.315 --> 21:12.045
I know Chakotay.

21:12.117 --> 21:15.177
This is his way
of taking responsibility.

21:15.254 --> 21:17.916
In his mind, he's trying
to protect the rest of us

21:17.990 --> 21:20.550
from a dangerous situation
which he created.

21:20.626 --> 21:22.093
Maybe, but that doesn't give him

21:22.161 --> 21:24.755
the privilege of ignoring
this ship's chain of command.

21:24.863 --> 21:25.761
I know that.

21:25.864 --> 21:27.525
It's just that...

21:27.600 --> 21:31.400
Chakotay would never tell you
any of this himself.

21:31.470 --> 21:34.234
And assuming we get him
back in one piece,

21:34.306 --> 21:35.238
you want to make sure

21:35.307 --> 21:37.207
I take his personal feelings
into account

21:37.276 --> 21:39.073
before I decide
how to discipline him.

21:40.679 --> 21:42.169
I know that you're
well within your rights

21:42.247 --> 21:44.181
to throw him into the brig,
but...

21:45.317 --> 21:47.649
Well...

21:47.720 --> 21:50.883
Chakotay is lucky to have
such a good friend.

21:52.057 --> 21:53.820
I'll tell you what.

21:55.694 --> 21:58.162
Why don't we deal
with getting him back

21:58.230 --> 21:59.492
in one piece first.

21:59.565 --> 22:02.591
We can worry about
the discipline later.

22:03.802 --> 22:04.826
Thank you.

22:10.342 --> 22:11.639
Computer, when will we enter

22:11.710 --> 22:13.302
the Kazon vessel's
scanner range?

22:13.379 --> 22:15.313
Approximately six minutes.

22:15.381 --> 22:17.474
Reduce power
to maneuvering thrusters

22:17.549 --> 22:19.449
and life support
to five percent.

22:19.518 --> 22:21.179
Cut all power to other systems.

22:29.795 --> 22:32.923
The Mostral should be here
in less than 20 hours.

22:32.998 --> 22:34.522
The Hobii in 15.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.397
Come look at this.

22:39.672 --> 22:42.539
Intermittent EM readings?

22:42.608 --> 22:44.633
I don't think so.

23:00.693 --> 23:03.389
Computer,
initiate continuous scans

23:03.462 --> 23:05.157
for the transporter oscillator.

23:05.230 --> 23:07.630
Initiating scans.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.634
Those aren't
normal fluctuations.

23:09.702 --> 23:12.262
They're energy spikes
from maneuvering thrusters.

23:12.337 --> 23:14.897
Probably a shuttle
running shadow maneuvers.

23:14.973 --> 23:16.702
He knows our scanners

23:16.775 --> 23:19.005
can't pinpoint
energy readings that low.

23:19.078 --> 23:20.340
Who?

23:20.412 --> 23:21.401
Maybe we can resonate

23:21.480 --> 23:23.277
a coherent polaron pulse
off his hull.

23:23.348 --> 23:25.248
Get a lock on him that way.

23:25.317 --> 23:27.285
Initiate a continuous
stream of pulses

23:27.352 --> 23:28.614
from the lateral deflectors.

23:28.687 --> 23:29.676
Maje?

23:34.493 --> 23:36.484
Come on, Seska.

23:36.562 --> 23:38.154
Where did you hide that module?

23:42.501 --> 23:43.695
There you are.

23:43.769 --> 23:44.929
Open a channel.

23:45.003 --> 23:46.766
To whom?

23:46.839 --> 23:49.399
Just transmit
on wide-band subspace.

23:49.475 --> 23:51.033
He'll hear me.

23:52.511 --> 23:54.706
Come on, find it!

23:54.780 --> 23:56.372
Hello, Chakotay.

23:56.448 --> 23:58.040
Very clever maneuvering,

23:58.117 --> 24:01.143
but I'm not about to let you
ruin all my hard work.

24:02.755 --> 24:04.347
Deploy a spread
of photonic charges

24:04.423 --> 24:07.324
centered on coordinates
124 by 217 --

24:07.392 --> 24:09.690
20 percent nominal yield.

24:09.762 --> 24:11.354
That won't be enough.

24:11.430 --> 24:13.796
We want that shuttle intact.

24:17.936 --> 24:20.166
Got you.

24:20.239 --> 24:22.503
Computer, power
the antiproton generator.

24:22.574 --> 24:24.166
Generator ready.

24:24.243 --> 24:26.370
Target a concentrated beam
to these coordinates.

24:26.445 --> 24:27.537
Beam targeted.

24:29.248 --> 24:30.215
Initiate!

24:30.282 --> 24:32.045
The generator is off-line.

24:32.117 --> 24:33.812
Great.

24:33.886 --> 24:37.754
Computer, launch the automated
message beacon.

24:37.856 --> 24:39.323
Beacon launched.

24:39.391 --> 24:41.450
Now take the inertial dampers
off-line.

24:43.028 --> 24:44.757
He's lost control
of the shuttle.

24:44.830 --> 24:45.922
We have him.

24:45.998 --> 24:48.023
Lock the towing emitter
onto his vessel

24:48.100 --> 24:49.965
and bring him
into the main hangar.

25:02.447 --> 25:04.415
Culluh calling Seska.

25:04.483 --> 25:05.780
This is Seska.

25:05.851 --> 25:07.648
He's not here.

25:07.719 --> 25:09.482
He must have transported aboard.

25:09.555 --> 25:10.522
Find him!

25:10.589 --> 25:11.521
I'm right here.

25:15.194 --> 25:16.957
Activate the message beacon.

25:23.735 --> 25:26.226
Lovely to see you again.

25:39.751 --> 25:42.720
Captain, I'm detecting
a Federation beacon

25:42.788 --> 25:45.655
at bearing 059 mark 72.

25:45.724 --> 25:48.420
This one's definitely ours--
Starfleet issue.

25:48.493 --> 25:49.687
All stop.

25:49.761 --> 25:52.161
The beacon is transmitting
an automated message.

25:54.166 --> 25:55.758
It is from Commander Chakotay.

25:57.035 --> 25:58.332
On screen.

25:59.905 --> 26:01.065
...to Voyager.

26:01.173 --> 26:03.107
If this signal
has been activated,

26:03.141 --> 26:04.768
it means that I have destroyed

26:04.843 --> 26:06.936
the Nistrim's
transporter capabilities.

26:07.012 --> 26:10.573
Captain, I apologize for acting
without authorization,

26:10.649 --> 26:13.584
but I ask you
not to put the ship or crew

26:13.652 --> 26:16.018
in further jeopardy
by attempting to rescue me.

26:16.088 --> 26:18.648
It's unlikely
that I'm still alive.

26:18.724 --> 26:21.921
Chakotay to Voyager.

26:21.994 --> 26:23.427
If this signal
has been activated...

26:37.943 --> 26:40.002
You can go.

26:45.350 --> 26:48.183
I see the Nistrim
take orders from you now.

26:48.253 --> 26:51.689
Let's just say I'm in a position
of some influence,

26:51.757 --> 26:54.089
which is fortunate for you.

26:54.159 --> 26:56.957
Culluh wanted
to execute you immediately,

26:57.029 --> 27:00.260
but I convinced him that you'd
be a valuable prisoner

27:00.332 --> 27:03.597
and that I should be the one
to interrogate you.

27:03.669 --> 27:05.432
Lucky me.

27:05.504 --> 27:07.335
Would you like a drink?

27:07.406 --> 27:11.638
The Kazon word for this
is "enemy's blood."

27:11.710 --> 27:13.735
It's not exactly fine cognac,

27:13.812 --> 27:15.746
but I've developed
a taste for it.

27:15.814 --> 27:17.509
Try some.

27:19.751 --> 27:22.015
No, thanks.

27:23.422 --> 27:25.856
You know, I've got
to hand it to you.

27:25.924 --> 27:28.825
I thought all these months
answering to Janeway

27:28.894 --> 27:30.691
would have made you soft,

27:30.796 --> 27:33.287
but all you needed was
a little slap in the face

27:33.365 --> 27:36.698
to get that Maquis heart
of yours beating again.

27:36.768 --> 27:38.702
Here's to old times.

27:38.804 --> 27:41.170
I have no interest
in reminiscing with you.

27:41.239 --> 27:44.003
I destroyed
the transporter module.

27:44.076 --> 27:45.304
The game's over.

27:45.377 --> 27:48.369
What do I need with a single
transporter module

27:48.447 --> 27:50.915
when I've got your shuttle
and all its technology

27:50.983 --> 27:52.473
sitting in our hanger?

27:52.551 --> 27:55.247
I think you'll find
that technology useless.

27:55.320 --> 27:58.983
I wiped the computer core
before I transported.

28:00.993 --> 28:03.621
I should have anticipated that.

28:03.695 --> 28:06.596
So if you're going
to have me killed, just do it.

28:09.868 --> 28:12.200
You're still the noble one,
aren't you?

28:12.270 --> 28:14.329
Ready to die for your shipmates.

28:16.074 --> 28:17.507
You know, Chakotay,

28:17.576 --> 28:20.136
I may not have
the transporter anymore,

28:20.212 --> 28:22.806
but I've got something better.

28:22.881 --> 28:24.849
You.

28:24.916 --> 28:28.374
Maybe that's
all I really wanted.

28:28.453 --> 28:30.887
I've missed you.

28:30.956 --> 28:33.584
You can't possibly believe
that you and I could still...

28:33.658 --> 28:35.057
Don't flatter yourself.

28:35.127 --> 28:36.856
It was never that good.

28:36.928 --> 28:37.860
You might have been

28:37.929 --> 28:39.453
an interesting diversion
now and then,

28:39.531 --> 28:41.089
but I've always been
less interested in you

28:41.166 --> 28:43.498
than in the information
you could provide me with.

28:43.568 --> 28:45.627
First, you gave me
your Maquis secrets

28:45.704 --> 28:48.764
and now I want
Voyager's command codes.

28:50.242 --> 28:52.403
If you think I'm going
to give you those codes,

28:52.477 --> 28:55.537
you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

28:55.614 --> 28:59.448
Maybe not,
but for old time's sake,

28:59.518 --> 29:01.816
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.945
There are half a dozen ships
from other Kazon sects

29:03.989 --> 29:06.116
on their way here right now.

29:06.191 --> 29:08.682
They're joining us
to help take Voyager.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.591
Why are you telling me this?

29:10.662 --> 29:14.223
I'm not a monster.

29:14.299 --> 29:17.496
I still care about Torres
and some of the others.

29:17.569 --> 29:19.332
I don't want to see
anybody get hurt.

29:19.404 --> 29:20.371
I never did.

29:20.439 --> 29:22.066
I'm touched.

29:22.140 --> 29:25.439
These Kazon aren't as
reasonable as you and l.

29:25.510 --> 29:27.273
I'm going to have to
use all my influence

29:27.345 --> 29:29.643
to make sure they
don't kill you all.

29:29.714 --> 29:31.978
But you've got to give me
something to work with.

29:32.050 --> 29:33.915
Voyager's not coming.

29:33.985 --> 29:35.475
I left them
explicit instructions

29:35.554 --> 29:36.521
not to follow me.

29:36.588 --> 29:39.557
So you can stop worrying
about people getting hurt.

29:42.727 --> 29:44.024
They'll come.

29:44.096 --> 29:46.121
They'd never leave
their First Officer

29:46.198 --> 29:47.631
in the hands of the Kazon.

29:47.699 --> 29:50.224
You may not give me
the command codes,

29:50.302 --> 29:55.831
but when Culluh gets through
with you, you'll wish you had.

30:00.679 --> 30:02.647
The message appears
to be authentic, Captain.

30:02.714 --> 30:04.272
We've got to go get him.

30:04.349 --> 30:06.044
Commander Chakotay has
expressly requested

30:06.118 --> 30:07.278
that we not attempt to do so.

30:07.352 --> 30:08.944
We don't have
to honor that request.

30:09.020 --> 30:10.317
Captain?

30:10.388 --> 30:12.879
If a rescue attempt forces
us to engage the Kazon,

30:12.958 --> 30:14.926
there is always a
possibility that more

30:14.993 --> 30:16.893
of our technology will
fall into their hands.

30:16.962 --> 30:18.190
Kim to the Captain.

30:18.263 --> 30:19.491
I'm picking up several vessels

30:19.564 --> 30:21.327
converging
on the Nistrim's location.

30:30.041 --> 30:31.736
My gut tells me

30:31.810 --> 30:34.005
we should go after Chakotay...

30:35.413 --> 30:39.577
but my better judgment,
tells me we should

30:39.651 --> 30:41.346
honor his request.

30:41.419 --> 30:46.322
I would never want you to ignore
your judgment, Captain,

30:46.391 --> 30:48.882
but let me ask you this.

30:48.960 --> 30:52.225
In your judgment,
how would the loss

30:52.297 --> 30:55.357
of our First Officer
affect this crew?

30:55.433 --> 30:58.561
What would it do
to the morale on this ship?

30:59.638 --> 31:01.128
Maybe this is an instance

31:01.239 --> 31:04.800
when your gut
is giving you better advice.

31:08.013 --> 31:09.412
Janeway to Conn.

31:09.481 --> 31:10.573
Paris here.

31:13.718 --> 31:15.379
Resume a course

31:15.453 --> 31:17.387
for Chakotay's shuttle.

31:17.455 --> 31:18.786
Aye, Captain.

31:24.529 --> 31:26.520
I'm losing patience, Federation.

31:33.605 --> 31:35.539
Just tell him
what he needs to know.

31:39.244 --> 31:41.712
She's quite a woman, isn't she?

31:43.181 --> 31:44.910
Does she rub your shoulders

31:44.983 --> 31:46.780
and tell you
you're the most exciting man

31:46.851 --> 31:48.614
she's ever known?

31:48.687 --> 31:50.086
That's what she
used to do for me.

31:51.990 --> 31:53.821
What's the matter?

31:53.892 --> 31:55.382
Didn't she tell you about us?

31:55.460 --> 31:59.829
Stop playing games
and give me the command codes.

31:59.898 --> 32:02.958
Flattery, devotion, sex...

32:03.068 --> 32:06.162
I always thought
she had a lot to offer a man.

32:06.204 --> 32:08.604
You talk too much, Federation,

32:08.673 --> 32:11.335
but you're not telling me
what I need to know.

32:11.409 --> 32:12.433
You're wrong, Culluh.

32:12.510 --> 32:14.671
I'm telling you exactly
what you need to know.

32:14.746 --> 32:16.976
She's using you.

32:17.048 --> 32:19.209
I'm the one who's using her.

32:19.284 --> 32:22.720
You've done an even better job
on him than you did on me.

32:22.787 --> 32:25.255
You talk to me, not to her.

32:25.323 --> 32:26.847
Then what's she doing here?

32:26.925 --> 32:28.586
Watching you work?!

32:28.660 --> 32:31.322
She used to like
to watch me work, too.

32:31.396 --> 32:33.421
I don't believe a word
you're saying,

32:33.498 --> 32:36.956
so you can stop trying
to distract me now

32:37.035 --> 32:38.969
and start answering questions.

32:39.037 --> 32:41.062
You know one thing
I especially liked?

32:41.139 --> 32:43.664
The little mole on her stomach.

32:46.077 --> 32:48.477
I guess you've seen it.

32:51.616 --> 32:54.210
I'm through
wasting my strength on you.

33:08.166 --> 33:12.603
Now give me the command codes.

33:13.738 --> 33:15.603
I'll give you something better.

33:15.674 --> 33:17.301
What?

33:17.375 --> 33:19.969
Firsthand information.

33:20.045 --> 33:21.842
Go ahead.

33:23.181 --> 33:25.945
When Seska's through with you...

33:28.853 --> 33:31.321
...she's going to kill you.

33:34.793 --> 33:36.260
He's delirious.

33:36.328 --> 33:38.558
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

33:38.630 --> 33:40.393
Give him some time.

33:42.100 --> 33:45.126
I'll be back in one hour.

33:45.203 --> 33:49.401
For his sake,
he'd better be more cooperative.

33:57.649 --> 34:00.641
Very clever ploy, Chakotay,

34:00.719 --> 34:03.745
but you know I'm not a killer.

34:13.164 --> 34:17.362
If I were, you'd have
been dead a long time ago.

34:28.446 --> 34:30.880
I have located the Nistrim
vessel on long-range sensors.

34:30.949 --> 34:32.974
Distance--.4 light-years.

34:33.051 --> 34:34.416
However, they are not alone.

34:34.485 --> 34:36.976
There are now at least
six other Kazon ships

34:37.054 --> 34:38.283
in the immediate vicinity.

34:38.356 --> 34:40.290
I didn't think Culluh
had that many ships.

34:40.358 --> 34:42.188
They must belong to enemy sects.

34:42.260 --> 34:43.693
That may be so,

34:43.762 --> 34:45.730
but the ships have not powered
their weapon systems.

34:45.797 --> 34:47.958
What do you make of it,
Neelix?

34:48.032 --> 34:50.023
It's certainly unusual
for rival Kazon

34:50.101 --> 34:51.125
sects to congregate peacefully.

34:51.202 --> 34:52.293
Is it possible

34:52.370 --> 34:54.634
the Nistrim have formed
an alliance with other sects?

34:55.907 --> 34:59.502
I've never known the Kazon to do
anything like that before.

34:59.577 --> 35:02.137
If the Nistrim have added
six ships to their force,

35:02.247 --> 35:05.239
it would be tactically unwise
to engage them.

35:05.283 --> 35:07.183
Then we'll just have
to find a way of getting

35:07.252 --> 35:09.243
Chakotay out of there
without picking a fight.

35:09.320 --> 35:11.288
We can transport him out.

35:11.356 --> 35:12.448
We would have to slow down

35:12.524 --> 35:15.084
once within transporter range,
giving the Kazon ample time

35:15.160 --> 35:16.149
to open fire.

35:16.227 --> 35:17.353
Not necessarily.

35:17.429 --> 35:19.693
We could beam him out
at warp speed

35:19.798 --> 35:21.561
without even slowing down.

35:21.633 --> 35:23.601
The Kazon would never
be able to catch us.

35:23.668 --> 35:25.932
That's difficult enough
when both ships

35:26.004 --> 35:27.164
are traveling at warp.

35:27.238 --> 35:28.535
The Kazon ship's
not even moving.

35:28.606 --> 35:30.039
I can compensate for that.

35:30.108 --> 35:31.040
How?

35:31.109 --> 35:32.599
By synchronizing
the transporter's

35:32.677 --> 35:35.043
annular confinement beam
to the warp core frequency.

35:35.113 --> 35:36.478
Maybe, but at a relative speed

35:36.548 --> 35:38.072
of two billion kilometers
per second,

35:38.149 --> 35:40.014
it's pretty tough
to get a lock on somebody.

35:40.084 --> 35:41.984
Ensign Kim is correct.

35:42.053 --> 35:42.985
We would risk scrambling

35:43.054 --> 35:44.681
his transporter signal
and killing him.

35:44.756 --> 35:47.520
It would be a direct violation
of Starfleet safety protocols.

35:47.592 --> 35:48.820
Do you have a better idea?

35:48.893 --> 35:50.758
Trust me, Captain.

35:50.829 --> 35:51.761
I can do it.

35:51.863 --> 35:53.490
How can you be so sure?

35:53.565 --> 35:55.760
Because I've done it before.

35:57.335 --> 35:58.859
When you are a Maquis,

35:58.937 --> 36:02.373
you don't always have the luxury
of following protocols.

36:05.343 --> 36:06.537
Ah!

36:06.611 --> 36:09.102
Jal Surat of the Mostral.

36:09.180 --> 36:12.741
May I present
Jal Loran of the Hobii

36:12.817 --> 36:16.116
and Jal Valek of the Oglamar?

36:16.187 --> 36:18.815
We've met before...

36:18.890 --> 36:21.154
in battle.

36:21.226 --> 36:25.856
Please, Jal Surat, sit down.

36:30.802 --> 36:35.569
Today is a day Kazon children
will remember for generations.

36:35.640 --> 36:39.076
Today is the day we put aside
our differences

36:39.143 --> 36:42.237
and join forces
to defeat Voyager.

36:43.882 --> 36:46.817
Today is the day
that marks the end

36:46.885 --> 36:49.581
of the supremacy
of the Relora and the Ogla

36:49.654 --> 36:55.092
because, after today, we will
have the Federation technology

36:55.159 --> 37:00.529
and the other sects
will run when they see us.

37:00.598 --> 37:04.534
That's a fine speech, Culluh,
but what makes you think

37:04.602 --> 37:08.561
Voyagerwon't use
this technology to defeat us?

37:08.640 --> 37:12.337
Because I have
Voyager's command codes.

37:12.410 --> 37:13.741
I have heard what you did

37:13.811 --> 37:17.008
to the Relora maje
and his companion--

37:17.081 --> 37:18.981
very impressive--

37:19.050 --> 37:24.147
but before I make an enemy of
these Federations, I want proof

37:24.222 --> 37:26.486
that you have
their command codes.

37:37.602 --> 37:40.435
May I present
Commander Chakotay--

37:40.505 --> 37:42.803
Voyager's First Officer.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.811
60 seconds to transporter range,
Captain.

37:57.889 --> 38:00.084
Bridge to Torres.
Have you located Chakotay?

38:00.158 --> 38:02.991
I'm reading Kazon life signs,
but still no Chakotay.

38:03.094 --> 38:04.459
Captain, I must remind you

38:04.495 --> 38:06.122
that we have
no direct evidence

38:06.197 --> 38:08.131
the Commander is still alive,
or if he is,

38:08.199 --> 38:09.393
that he's still
aboard that ship.

38:09.467 --> 38:10.593
I'm not conceding that yet.

38:10.668 --> 38:12.158
Can you give me anything,
B'Elanna?

38:13.438 --> 38:16.236
I'm picking up some kind
of localized dampening field.

38:16.307 --> 38:18.207
It's blocking
our targeting scanners.

38:18.276 --> 38:20.836
Maybe Seska's found a way
to hide Chakotay from us.

38:22.113 --> 38:23.546
You may be right.

38:23.615 --> 38:25.640
I've got to reinitialize
the targeting scanners

38:25.717 --> 38:28.413
to match the relative phase
of the dampening field.

38:30.989 --> 38:32.854
I've found him, Captain.

38:32.924 --> 38:34.357
He's still alive.

38:34.425 --> 38:36.120
Can you get him out of there?

38:36.194 --> 38:39.027
The damping field is disrupting
our transporter signal.

38:39.097 --> 38:40.428
I can't get a lock on him.

38:40.498 --> 38:41.692
Red Alert.

38:41.766 --> 38:43.631
Mr. Paris, take us out of warp.

38:46.838 --> 38:48.897
It's Voyager.

38:48.973 --> 38:50.031
Well, Culluh?

38:50.108 --> 38:51.632
What are you waiting for?

38:51.709 --> 38:53.973
Use the command codes
to disable them.

38:55.680 --> 38:58.012
Bridge,
this is First Maje Culluh.

38:58.082 --> 39:01.848
Lock weapons onto
the Federation ship and fire.

39:05.823 --> 39:07.814
Mr. Paris, evasive
pattern delta four.

39:07.892 --> 39:09.291
Mr. Tuvok, return fire.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.486
Firing phasers.

39:10.561 --> 39:11.528
Bridge to Torres.

39:11.596 --> 39:12.585
Can you transport Chakotay?

39:12.664 --> 39:14.632
I'm matching
the pattern buffer frequency

39:14.699 --> 39:16.166
to the Kazon dampening field.

39:16.234 --> 39:18.065
Make it fast.

39:18.136 --> 39:20.001
I've got a lock.

39:20.071 --> 39:21.936
Initiating transport.

39:36.688 --> 39:37.985
Do you have him, B'Elanna?

39:38.056 --> 39:39.023
I had him for a second,

39:39.090 --> 39:40.990
but they've remodulated
the dampening field.

39:41.059 --> 39:42.788
Can you compensate?

39:42.860 --> 39:44.953
I'm trying,
but I need more time.

39:45.029 --> 39:47.862
We'll try to hold them off,
but we don't have long.

39:47.932 --> 39:50.332
Mr. Tuvok, phasers to maximum.

39:50.401 --> 39:52.198
Let's give them
a little distraction.

39:55.606 --> 39:59.167
Why are you allowing them
to continue firing?

39:59.243 --> 40:00.904
It's taking longer
than I thought

40:00.978 --> 40:02.343
to interface with their systems.

40:02.413 --> 40:05.473
You must order your ships
to provide cover.

40:05.550 --> 40:09.111
I hope you know
what you're doing.

40:13.091 --> 40:14.581
The other Kazon vessels
have opened fire.

40:14.659 --> 40:17.253
Mr. Paris, evasive
pattern omega two.

40:17.328 --> 40:18.295
Aye, Captain.

40:18.362 --> 40:19.761
Bridge to Torres.

40:19.831 --> 40:21.628
You're going to have
to hurry it up down there.

40:21.699 --> 40:22.893
We can't hold them off
much longer.

40:22.967 --> 40:24.764
I'm doing the best I can.

40:24.869 --> 40:29.306
We're losing patience, Culluh.

40:32.810 --> 40:34.607
Where are you going?

40:34.679 --> 40:36.010
To the Bridge.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.104
I might have better luck

40:37.181 --> 40:39.115
interfacing with Voyager's
systems from there.

40:39.183 --> 40:40.775
I'll go with you.

40:40.852 --> 40:44.413
You'll stay right here.

40:45.590 --> 40:47.615
Aft shields down
to 23 percent, Captain.

40:47.692 --> 40:48.659
Bridge to Torres.

40:48.726 --> 40:50.489
Can you transport
Chakotay out or not?

40:50.561 --> 40:52.825
They've put the dampening field
on some kind

40:52.897 --> 40:54.626
of randomly fluctuating
modulation.

40:54.699 --> 40:57.327
It'll take me at least an hour
to match the phase variances.

40:57.401 --> 40:59.198
Shields at 16 percent.

40:59.270 --> 41:01.568
Captain, we must retreat.

41:01.672 --> 41:03.902
Lieutenant, just how localized
is that dampening field?

41:03.941 --> 41:05.272
A little more than two meters

41:05.343 --> 41:08.710
in diameter-- just enough
to isolate Chakotay. Why?

41:08.813 --> 41:11.441
I think I've got an idea.

41:11.516 --> 41:14.508
I don't think you ever
had those command codes.

41:14.585 --> 41:15.984
I think you're a liar.

41:16.053 --> 41:17.816
What does it matter?

41:17.889 --> 41:19.083
If we work together,

41:19.157 --> 41:21.455
we don't need the command codes
to beat them.

41:21.526 --> 41:22.550
You're right.

41:22.627 --> 41:23.889
We can beat them,

41:23.961 --> 41:26.896
but we're going
to do it without you.

41:26.964 --> 41:29.797
We're taking your ship.

41:36.841 --> 41:39.036
Please stay where you are.

41:39.110 --> 41:41.601
You will find
that our transporters

41:41.679 --> 41:44.011
have rendered
your weapons useless.

41:46.217 --> 41:50.620
I will make you very sorry
for this, Culluh.

41:50.688 --> 41:52.212
Here are the terms, gentlemen.

41:52.290 --> 41:55.157
The safe return of our First
Officer and shuttlecraft

41:55.226 --> 41:57.091
in exchange for your freedom.

41:57.161 --> 42:00.790
I presume you will find that
an acceptable arrangement.

42:06.070 --> 42:10.131
Captain's Log, Stardate 4921 1.5.

42:10.208 --> 42:13.234
Now that Commander Chakotay
has made a full recovery,

42:13.311 --> 42:14.869
I'm faced
with the difficult task

42:14.946 --> 42:18.677
of responding to his failure
to follow procedure.

42:18.749 --> 42:20.148
Just tell me one thing.

42:20.218 --> 42:22.015
What were you thinking?

42:23.387 --> 42:26.720
About keeping our technology
out of Kazon hands.

42:26.858 --> 42:28.883
I thought if I did it on my own,

42:28.960 --> 42:31.121
I could keep the rest
of the crew out of danger.

42:31.195 --> 42:33.527
That may be
a very noble sentiment,

42:33.598 --> 42:37.090
but it wasn't
your decision to make.

42:41.572 --> 42:44.735
Oh, Chakotay...

42:44.809 --> 42:49.075
we've spent the last ten months
together on this ship.

42:49.146 --> 42:51.774
I thought we had
an understanding.

42:51.849 --> 42:54.511
Why did you choose
to ignore procedure?

42:56.654 --> 42:59.282
Seska was my problem--

42:59.357 --> 43:02.019
a problem I felt it
was my duty to solve.

43:02.126 --> 43:03.593
So you had a...

43:03.628 --> 43:06.062
personal score to settle.

43:07.899 --> 43:09.298
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

43:09.367 --> 43:10.698
Really?

43:10.768 --> 43:12.065
Tell me this.

43:17.541 --> 43:19.532
How do you expect me
to keep order

43:19.610 --> 43:21.339
when the First Officer
takes it upon himself

43:21.412 --> 43:23.539
to run off like some cowboy
because he decides

43:23.614 --> 43:26.174
it's a good idea?

43:26.250 --> 43:28.718
What you did was commendable.

43:28.786 --> 43:31.619
The way you did it was not.

43:31.689 --> 43:35.216
You set a terrible example,
and on a personal level,

43:35.293 --> 43:36.920
you've made my job
more difficult.

43:38.362 --> 43:42.298
If that's so, I regret it.

43:43.567 --> 43:45.626
I'm putting you on report,

43:45.703 --> 43:48.001
in case that means
anything anymore.

43:49.507 --> 43:52.067
It means something to me,
Captain.

43:52.143 --> 43:54.577
It means I've let you down

43:54.645 --> 43:56.545
and for that, I'm truly sorry.

43:56.614 --> 43:58.138
Bridge to ready room.

43:58.215 --> 43:59.773
Go ahead, Mr. Tuvok.

43:59.850 --> 44:01.249
I think you
and Commander Chakotay

44:01.352 --> 44:02.580
should come in here.

44:02.620 --> 44:04.315
On our way.

44:08.359 --> 44:11.192
I have located an automated
message beacon, Captain.

44:11.262 --> 44:12.422
Another one?

44:12.496 --> 44:14.396
It is a message
to Commander Chakotay

44:14.465 --> 44:15.796
from Seska.

44:15.866 --> 44:17.265
Would you like Mr. Kim

44:17.335 --> 44:19.462
to put it through
to your office?

44:19.537 --> 44:22.597
No, I think I've spent enough
time alone with Seska.

44:22.673 --> 44:24.106
Very well.

44:24.175 --> 44:25.506
Put it on screen.

44:26.043 --> 44:27.704
Hello, Chakotay.

44:27.778 --> 44:29.973
Congratulations on your victory.

44:30.047 --> 44:32.174
I look forward
to our next meeting.

44:32.249 --> 44:34.809
Oh, and there's something
you should know.

44:34.885 --> 44:36.147
While you were unconscious,

44:36.220 --> 44:38.882
I took the liberty of extracting
a sample of your DNA.

44:38.956 --> 44:41.618
I impregnated myself with it.

44:41.692 --> 44:46.152
So, I guess more congratulations
are in order.

44:46.230 --> 44:49.165
You're going to be a father.
