I was trying to prove myself
to replace John.

I just wanted to show everyone
that I was worthy,

40:18.241 --> 40:21.070

- John?

40:22.898 --> 40:25.379
We don't need another John.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.250
We need you.

40:27.294 --> 40:31.516
Astra, I wasn't mad
about the cops.

40:31.559 --> 40:32.734
I wasn't happy about them,

40:32.778 --> 40:36.303
but I was upset
that you almost died.

40:36.346 --> 40:37.652
I like having you around.

40:37.696 --> 40:39.785
You're like my best friend.

40:42.744 --> 40:45.443
- No one's ever
said that to me.

40:47.488 --> 40:50.230
But you're mine too.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.492
- Good.

40:51.536 --> 40:54.495
And if anything goes wrong,
we'll handle it.

40:54.539 --> 40:57.542
I got your back.

40:57.585 --> 40:59.587

40:59.631 --> 41:01.981
I almost finished that spell.

41:02.024 --> 41:03.112
- You didn't finish it?

41:03.156 --> 41:05.854
- No, it was too much for me.

41:05.898 --> 41:08.640
I bet John
would've finished it.

41:08.683 --> 41:09.989
- Unum.

41:10.032 --> 41:11.904
That was the last word.

41:11.947 --> 41:15.560

to make us a nice steak.

41:17.910 --> 41:19.825
- Steak?
Okay, I wish Gideon was here

41:19.868 --> 41:21.696
