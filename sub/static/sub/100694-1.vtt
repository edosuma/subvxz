00:22.230 --> 00:24.566
[Sergio] So, what do you wish me to say?

00:25.442 --> 00:28.403
[woman] We're gonna have new staff members
watch this video on their first day.

00:28.486 --> 00:29.738
[Sergio] I see. Some, uh...

00:30.113 --> 00:33.116
some spontaneous wisdom, right?

00:33.283 --> 00:36.036
[woman] How you came to be
High Commissioner for Human Rights.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.996
[Sergio] Oh, my God. But you realize

00:38.121 --> 00:41.666
I can't summarize 34 years
in three minutes.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.626
[woman] Maybe tell us where you served.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.087
Cambodia, Timor, Bosnia.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.964
[Sergio] Lebanon, Rwanda.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.467
You are asking me to recount my life.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.218
But I suppose it’s, uh...

00:53.595 --> 00:55.055
It's intended to be...

00:55.889 --> 00:57.098
inspirational.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.016
Right?

00:58.099 --> 00:59.184
[woman] Absolutely.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.101
[Sergio] Okay.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.603
[clears throat]

01:02.103 --> 01:02.937
Hi.

01:03.521 --> 01:06.191
My name is Sergio Vieira de Mello.
I'm Brazilian,

01:06.816 --> 01:09.903
and I'm presently the UN High Commissioner
for Human Rights.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.197
This organization

01:12.447 --> 01:16.367
is the best opportunity you'll have
in your life of achieving your dreams.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.453
But never forget...

01:19.662 --> 01:24.417
the real challenges and the real rewards
of serving the United Nations

01:24.501 --> 01:26.336
are out there in the field.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.340
Where people are suffering,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.175

of the United States,

04:08.206 --> 04:11.459
and I reminded him of the position
of the United Nations on this issue.

04:12.752 --> 04:17.590
I don’t think anyone can predict
what the human cost of a war will be,

04:19.050 --> 04:20.134

11:32.775 --> 11:35.903
And I would want it to come to an end
very, very quickly.

11:37.697 --> 11:42.576
I see our role here as one that supports
the Iraqi people

11:42.660 --> 11:46.205

as soon as possible

11:46.288 --> 11:48.416

God damn it. He got a sit-down
with Ayatollah Sistani?

12:21.741 --> 12:25.327
He's not supposed to take any initiative.
The UN works for us.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.080
Sistani won't meet anyone.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.791
I can't even get His Eminence
to return my calls.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.586
How the hell did Sergio make that happen?

12:33.669 --> 12:35.671

He just went and did it.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.035
-Yes?
-What I do?

13:06.118 --> 13:06.952
[Gaby] Step back.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.287
What I do? Starve?

13:08.370 --> 13:10.122
-[Gaby] Sergio...
-Become a thief?

13:10.206 --> 13:11.832
-No. You must not do that. No.
-[Gaby] Step back.

13:12.374 --> 13:15.002
-I'm a university graduate!
-[Sergio] I understand.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.930
[Carolina] We need to reopen the bridges
and get people back to work

13:26.013 --> 13:27.765
so they can get across town,

13:28.432 --> 13:31.644
get in their taxi, in their car, and...

13:31.727 --> 13:33.687
-go through gates without being detained.
-All good?

13:34.355 --> 13:37.566
-King Abdullah is confirmed for Tuesday,
-Mm-hmm.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.360
then to Tehran for President Khatami.

-Okay. Thank you, Lynn.
-You're welcome.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.251
[Sergio] I can't believe these guys

-Nadya.
-Yeah.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.504
How many detainees?

13:58.587 --> 14:00.714
Thousands. They raid homes every night.

14:12.476 --> 14:13.936
[Bremer] Check this out, Sergio.

14:16.230 --> 14:20.276
They tell me the guards painted
this graffiti themselves

14:20.359 --> 14:24.154
so the prisoners would know
what was to come.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.658
We came as liberators, my friend.

14:30.911 --> 14:31.954
Yes. Uh...

14:32.538 --> 14:35.791
the Iraqi people deserve better
than Saddam Hussein.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.586
-On that we can all agree.
-Absolutely.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.087
That's why I'm, uh...

14:41.297 --> 14:42.464
[inhales deeply]

14:42.548 --> 14:43.757
I must say...

14:44.425 --> 14:46.010
I'm surprised, Paul,

14:46.594 --> 14:49.555
to hear that you are rebuilding
Abu Ghraib.

14:49.930 --> 14:53.851
We're mopping up resistance, Sergio.
We have to put people someplace.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.353
Yes.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.105
Yet the, uh...

14:58.814 --> 15:00.357

15:00.774 --> 15:03.527
Saddam's torture chambers...

15:03.777 --> 15:04.945
[inhales sharply]

15:06.280 --> 15:08.741
It's not the message
you want to send, Paul.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.659
Let me worry about that, okay?

15:12.995 --> 15:13.829
Sergio...

15:15.706 --> 15:16.957
the White House likes you,

15:18.667 --> 15:20.085
and the President too,

15:20.961 --> 15:23.839
but surprises make Washington
very nervous.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.507
How can I help?

15:25.925 --> 15:26.759
Well,

15:27.301 --> 15:28.385
you're meeting with...

15:28.886 --> 15:30.721
Sistani for a start. That doesn't help.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.933
It gives the impression
I'm not in control.

15:34.016 --> 15:34.892
I see.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.519
Listen, Paul.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.358
My conversation with Sistani
went really well.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.693
He can support the coalition

15:45.027 --> 15:49.281
if we hold elections
under an Iraqi constitution.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.201
We have our own plan for elections.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.829
We gotta stabilize the situation.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.665
It must be soon, Paul.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.459
The longer you stay here,

16:00.876 --> 16:02.878
the worse it will get. Please trust me.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.340
This isn't East Timor.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.968
You're not viceroy here, Sergio.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.221
Welcome to the big leagues.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.976
[reporter] Did you agree on what role
the UN will play here?

16:17.059 --> 16:20.646
Uh, my good friend Sergio
and I had a productive discussion

16:20.729 --> 16:22.189
covering a range of issues.

16:22.272 --> 16:25.985
We both agree
on a peaceful and free Iraq.

16:27.361 --> 16:31.615
The role of the UN
is something we are working to define.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.201
Good to see you, Paul.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.787
-You too, Sergio.
-[man] That's it, folks. No more questions.

16:36.870 --> 16:40.541

the Abu Ghraib prison you can speak of?

-Get back!

17:18.412 --> 17:19.997
Sergio! Sergio!

17:21.165 --> 17:22.624
Sergio! Mr. De Mello.

17:23.083 --> 17:23.917
Mr. De Mello.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.045
You were with Paul Bremer at Abu Ghraib.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.173
Is the UN just a cover
for the American occupation?

17:32.968 --> 17:34.720
First of all, my friend,

17:35.429 --> 17:36.889
I'm answering your question,

17:36.972 --> 17:39.391
the UN, its Secretary-General,

17:39.475 --> 17:42.061
and Sergio Vierira de Mello,
representing the Secretary-General,

17:42.144 --> 17:44.229
are no tool and no cover for anyone.

17:45.522 --> 17:46.565
All right?

17:46.648 --> 17:47.608
Let's go, Sergio.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.818
We are an independent organization.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.073
Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and myself are independent.

17:54.656 --> 17:55.657
From anyone.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.285
So don't suggest for a second

17:58.368 --> 18:01.955
we are here supporting the United States
or the coalition.

18:02.039 --> 18:02.873
All right?

18:04.708 --> 18:05.542
Thank you.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.128
[reporters shouting questions]

18:13.550 --> 18:16.595
Pull together everything
we know about the occupation.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.223
Roadblocks, detentions, torture,

18:19.306 --> 18:20.682
Abu Ghraib, everything.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.354
We will send a full dossier
to the Security Council tomorrow morning.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.315
Let's do this. No time to waste.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.233
Let's go.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.238
-[Carolina] Let's add an appendix...
-Okay, I'll review it.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.739
...to the economics section
with all the data.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.787
[approaching footsteps]

18:44.164 --> 18:45.582
[Carolina sighs]

18:45.874 --> 18:47.292
[in Spanish] Coffee?

18:47.376 --> 18:48.210
[responds in Spanish]

18:51.839 --> 18:52.840
[Carolina sighs]

18:52.923 --> 18:53.841
Sugar?

18:54.174 --> 18:55.092
Yes.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.060
[Carolina laughs]

19:06.103 --> 19:07.062
Three.

19:13.777 --> 19:14.778
Perfect.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.489
A little more coffee in your sugar?

19:18.574 --> 19:19.616
Stir it.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.167
This will be a long night.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.636
We'll need a strong cover note
for the dossier.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.850
[Carolina in English] We need to
tell the world what's happening here.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.144
Wait.

19:47.227 --> 19:50.230
Is this going public,
or is it just for the Security Council?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.107
Only for the Security Council.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.320
The Americans are going to go nuts
with this.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.948
-Sergio--
-No, let's not make it worse. No.

20:04.953 --> 20:05.913

20:15.964 --> 20:16.924
Very soon.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.554
[chuckles]

20:27.351 --> 20:29.269
[Bill] Can you move your leg, Sergio?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.980
Can you move any parts of your body,
other than the ones I've seen?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.942
-No.
-[Bill] No? It's okay.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.485
I just want to know. Don't--

20:36.818 --> 20:39.738
-[Sergio sobs and groans]
-Just stay relaxed. Stay relaxed.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.743
-We're just talking here.
-My arm...

20:45.202 --> 20:46.245
My arm is...

20:47.412 --> 20:48.705

[exhales]

21:28.453 --> 21:30.372

21:30.455 --> 21:31.290
That's Bremer.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.259
[inhales deeply]
Paul.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.344
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

21:44.428 --> 21:47.097
Sergio, that was, uh,
quite a performance you had there.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.432
<i>No tool,</i>

21:48.724 --> 21:50.976
<i>no cover for anyone not here...</i>

21:51.393 --> 21:52.936
<i>supporting the occupation.</i>

21:53.020 --> 21:56.064
I honestly believe
this serves both our interests, Paul.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.525
<i>If the Iraqis know the UN is independent,</i>

21:58.608 --> 22:01.570
then the elections we supervise
will be seen as legitimate.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.990
And if the elections are legitimate,
Paul, then...

22:05.073 --> 22:06.158
[sighs]

22:06.241 --> 22:07.743
then we can all go home.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.079
I've decided there won't be any elections,

22:11.163 --> 22:12.289
<i>not until we're ready.</i>

22:16.335 --> 22:17.419
Yes, I...

22:18.003 --> 22:20.881
I also decided something
I needed to share with you.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.132
<i>Tomorrow morning,</i>

22:22.215 --> 22:25.427
we'll send the Security Council
a full dossier concerning the occupation

22:25.510 --> 22:28.472
<i>and its many human rights violations,</i>
<i>Paul.</i>

22:28.847 --> 22:30.766
You know what? Hang on, hang on.
Pull over.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.893
Pull over. Give me one second.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.356
-Paul?
-[car door slamming on phone]

22:37.439 --> 22:40.984
A dossier to the Security Council?
You can't do that, Sergio.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.403
With all due respect, Paul,
you have no authority

22:43.487 --> 22:45.238
to tell me what I can or cannot do.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.491
[Bremer] The Security Council mandate
is very clear.

22:47.574 --> 22:52.079
You're here to support our effort
to stabilize and rebuild Iraq.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.998
<i>-That's the only reason you're here.</i>
-The only reason I'm here

22:55.082 --> 22:56.458
is because you broke it,

22:56.541 --> 22:58.043
and you have no idea

22:58.126 --> 23:00.420
-how to put it back together again.
-Sergio...

23:00.504 --> 23:02.047
you're an ambitious guy.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.757
Yeah, attacking the US

23:03.882 --> 23:06.343
<i>isn't the best way</i>
<i>to become the next Secretary-General,</i>

23:06.426 --> 23:07.302
<i>I can tell you that.</i>

23:07.386 --> 23:08.387
Goodbye, Paul.

23:21.024 --> 23:21.858

23:23.944 --> 23:25.237
that went well.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.073
[exhales]

23:30.075 --> 23:31.368
I thought so too.

Security-wise, there will be three.

There's going to be Gil and Sergio.

23:42.629 --> 23:45.173
We might stay overnight

23:45.715 --> 23:46.883
-Thank you, Nadya.
-Thank you.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.009
[Nadya] Thank you.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.349
[man] Carolina, here's the economics

Thanks.

[Gil scoffs] Wow.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.237
It's... all here.

Call a press conference for 9:00 a.m.,
before DC wakes up.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.791
A press conference? We're going public?

24:20.750 --> 24:21.793
Yes, we are.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.214
The world has a right to know
what's going on here.

24:28.592 --> 24:29.426

-What happened?
-[Bill] We're going to get you out.

Hey, Gil? Gil, are you okay?

26:06.523 --> 26:07.357
Gil?

26:07.774 --> 26:09.859
Liberator Base, this is Liberator Seven.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.695
I have two survivors

26:11.778 --> 26:16.199
inside the building near the ground level,
under the pancaked portion of the roof.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.493
-Do you copy?
-[Gil] My girls.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.036
[static hiss on radio]

26:20.120 --> 26:21.705
How are my girls?

26:23.999 --> 26:26.876
[Bill] I've got a daughter too.
They're pretty special, huh?

26:28.253 --> 26:31.381
Liberator Base, I have survivors.
I repeat, I have survivors.

26:31.464 --> 26:32.465
Please acknowledge. Over.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.553
[boys laughing]

26:37.846 --> 26:39.764
[birds chirping]

26:40.223 --> 26:42.225
[Sergio panting]

27:01.286 --> 27:04.164
[Bill] Liberator Base,
this is Liberator Seven. Do you copy?

27:04.914 --> 27:05.749
Over.

27:10.211 --> 27:11.129
Damn.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.298
[Sergio] How is my team?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.133
How is everybody?

27:15.967 --> 27:17.093
How is Carolina?

27:17.719 --> 27:19.054
How is Carolina?

27:31.608 --> 27:32.817
-You're alone.
-What?

27:34.194 --> 27:35.195
What?

27:36.363 --> 27:37.364
You're alone.

27:40.408 --> 27:42.285
-No bodyguard today.
-Oh.

27:43.536 --> 27:44.788
I, uh...

27:45.705 --> 27:46.790
I snuck out.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.543
I'm sure when he notices I'm missing,
he'll...

27:50.919 --> 27:51.878
he'll come running.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.505
Are you missing?

27:54.964 --> 27:55.799
Maybe.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.550
I'm Sergio.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.304
-Sergio. Sergio de Mello.
-Yeah.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.140
Well, you're not allowed to go missing.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.975
[distant rapid gunfire]

28:07.686 --> 28:08.603
Huh.

28:10.355 --> 28:14.025
Nothing quite like the sound
of a Kalashnikov in the morning.

28:16.611 --> 28:19.447
I guess our ceasefire
has yet to take hold.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.783
[rapid gunfire]

28:23.451 --> 28:25.912
It's an LMG version.
Six hundred rounds per minute.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.166
I need to get back. Maybe you do too.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.084
Who are you?

28:32.252 --> 28:33.128
What's your name?

28:37.924 --> 28:39.551
[Gaby] I can't protect you like that.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.137
-Did you hear this?
-Yeah.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.056
At least you have to let me know
where you are.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.476
I know. I'm sorry. It came from there,
I think. Right in the woods.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.228
-The bushes.
-Let's go.

28:51.604 --> 28:52.647
Come on. Let's go.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.816
[rapid gunfire continues]

28:54.899 --> 28:57.068
[car alarms blaring]

28:57.152 --> 28:59.446
[indistinct yelling and coughing]

29:00.572 --> 29:02.866
[woman wailing]

29:03.658 --> 29:05.618
We'll take him to the collection point.

29:06.619 --> 29:09.038
[Carolina] Sergio! Sergio!

29:09.831 --> 29:11.207
Give me six inside.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.960
Hey, guys, set me up a perimeter
all the way around.

29:14.377 --> 29:16.671
Get these walking wounded out of here!

29:16.755 --> 29:17.922
[soldier] Stay where you are.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.841
[Carolina] Lynn?

29:20.008 --> 29:21.593
[Lynn sobs]

29:21.801 --> 29:23.052
I'm so sorry!

29:24.888 --> 29:27.140
You guys post up here.
Nobody gets through.

29:27.724 --> 29:28.558
Go, go, go!

29:28.641 --> 29:30.643
[yelling and wailing continuing]

29:34.898 --> 29:36.608
[anchor] <i>We have this breaking news</i>
<i>to tell you about.</i>

[Gil moaning]

30:29.953 --> 30:31.079
Hold on, brother.

30:32.789 --> 30:33.623
Hold on.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.500
They'll get us out soon.

-[church bell ringing]

30:47.512 --> 30:49.514
[approaching footsteps]

30:51.182 --> 30:54.727
[Sergio] I don't believe
in being fashionably late either.

30:56.437 --> 30:58.731
No. For a diplomatic meeting, never.

31:00.024 --> 31:03.695
So there are some occasions
that call for being late?

31:03.778 --> 31:05.238
Oh, yes. Of course.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.781
Depending on the situation.

31:09.242 --> 31:12.954
My mother taught me always keep them
waiting and leave them wanting more.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.004
I'm Carolina, by the way.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.382
[in Spanish]
Carolina Larriera, from Argentina.

31:24.757 --> 31:27.343
Quit Wall Street to come out here
and change the world.

31:28.136 --> 31:32.682
Economic advisor
to our transitional government.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.184
-[in English] You do your homework.
-Absolutely.

31:35.935 --> 31:38.730
That's something my mother taught me.

31:39.188 --> 31:41.733
Okay. I see. [chuckles]

31:43.985 --> 31:44.861
Carolina...

31:46.571 --> 31:48.406
what do you think of our prospects?

31:48.865 --> 31:51.242
I think if you do your job,
I will do mine.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.328
[car approaching]

31:53.411 --> 31:55.997
-Sergio, he's here.
-[Sergio] That's not what I meant.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.832
-[Carolina] I know.
-[Gil] He's here, Sergio.

31:57.916 --> 31:58.791
Excuse me.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.881
-[car doors closing]
-[men talking indistinctly]

32:10.637 --> 32:12.055
[Sergio] General Gusmao.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.142
[in Portuguese] Nice to finally meet you.

32:16.434 --> 32:20.772
It's an honor and a privilege
to serve East Timor.

32:21.564 --> 32:24.734
Mr. de Mello, I've heard a lot about you.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.820
[in English] The world's Mr. Fix-It
they call you, right?

32:27.904 --> 32:29.030
[in Portuguese]
It's not like that.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.074
Over time, we've developed

32:31.616 --> 32:35.870
certain modalities
for conflict resolution.

32:36.746 --> 32:40.083
[in English] What modalities
do you envision for us, Mr. de Mello?

32:41.125 --> 32:43.211
Well, a total ceasefire for a start.

32:46.005 --> 32:50.051
You know, I recently met
with the prime minister of Cambodia,

32:50.635 --> 32:52.679
and he told me to beware of you guys.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.849
He told me that the UN ran around
his country for two years

32:56.933 --> 32:58.351
and left nothing behind.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.062
There is a different side to that story.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.149
And if you'll allow me
to introduce you to our...

33:06.067 --> 33:07.443
transitional government.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.988
This is, uh, Gil Loescher,

33:10.071 --> 33:11.906
-our Deputy Administrator.
-Gusmao, nice to meet you.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.450
-Nice to meet you.
-Daniel Travers, Finance Minister.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.744
Doctor Faith Abujia, Minister of Health.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.037
No, I'm sorry.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.456
[in Portuguese] I apologize.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.836
You have quick fixes
for complex issues, don't you?

33:25.837 --> 33:29.048
Indonesia wants to wipe my country
off the map.

33:29.674 --> 33:33.553
We don't have time for UN modalities

33:33.636 --> 33:37.598
that led to the death
of millions in Bosnia and Rwanda

33:37.682 --> 33:39.892
while UN peacekeepers simply watched.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.395
You can't judge what you don't know.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.105
We've learned from our mistakes.

33:44.188 --> 33:48.443
Of course. Now you need a success story.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.698
We've fought for our independence
for 24 years

33:54.741 --> 33:56.993
We're not going to be your experiment.

33:58.828 --> 33:59.954
[in English] By the way, uh...

34:02.123 --> 34:02.957
this...

34:04.834 --> 34:06.794
this is worn by elders...

34:07.795 --> 34:10.006
and respected leaders only.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.429
[issues orders to soldier]

34:17.180 --> 34:18.681
[vehicle starts]

34:42.371 --> 34:43.748
[sighs]

34:43.831 --> 34:44.874
How are you?

34:48.461 --> 34:49.295
I...

34:51.047 --> 34:55.301
I think I may be here longer than planned.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.349
Always leave them wanting more.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.066
And what else did your mother teach you?

35:12.819 --> 35:14.028
[laughs]

35:14.654 --> 35:15.780
Um...

35:17.740 --> 35:19.909
To beware of wandering married men.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.375
So you did your homework?

35:29.752 --> 35:30.962
Absolutely.

35:42.056 --> 35:43.099
See you around.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.277
The most powerful official in UN history.

35:55.903 --> 35:56.904
[sighs]

35:57.446 --> 35:58.906
Now the question is...

35:59.323 --> 36:01.784
what to do with all that power?

36:04.912 --> 36:06.289
Well, yeah.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.709
[both chuckling]

36:10.626 --> 36:12.086
You had it coming, you know.

36:12.712 --> 36:15.214
Getting ripped a new asshole
in front of everybody.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.051
I'm sure you enjoyed it.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.974
If I was General Gusmao,
you know what I'd think?

36:25.683 --> 36:26.976
I'd think Sergio Vieira de Mello

36:27.560 --> 36:30.813
is here to cut a deal
with the Indonesians, sell out the rebels,

36:30.897 --> 36:33.482
and declare another victory quickly.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.359
You wouldn't think that.

36:36.944 --> 36:38.905
And he was right to bring up Cambodia.

36:39.822 --> 36:42.074
Still no justice for two million dead.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.619
leng kept his promise.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.788
At least on the refugees.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.180
-[man] Stop! Stop!
-[guns cocking]

37:04.263 --> 37:05.932
-[Gil] Oh, shit.
-Stop, stop! [yelling]

37:06.015 --> 37:07.266
-[Sergio] Calm down.
-[Gil] We're the UN.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.352
-[men yelling]
-[Gil] I have family. Please don't shoot.

37:09.435 --> 37:10.478
[Sergio] Okay. Yes, yes, yes.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.687
-[Gil] Please don't shoot!
-[men yelling]

37:11.771 --> 37:12.647
[Sergio] Yes.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.148
[birds chirping]

37:14.899 --> 37:16.108
-[men yelling indistinctly]
-[Sergio] All right.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.444
Stay together. Do as they say.

37:18.527 --> 37:19.904
[soldiers continue to yell]

37:19.987 --> 37:21.322
[Sergio] Okay.

37:23.658 --> 37:24.784
[Gil] Ieng Sary.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.995
All he has to do is nod his head
and we're dead.

37:28.746 --> 37:29.580
Stay here.

37:30.122 --> 37:32.458
[Gil] What the hell are you doing? Sergio?

37:32.541 --> 37:34.293
-It's all right. It's okay.
-[Gil] What?

37:36.587 --> 37:37.421
Careful.

37:39.674 --> 37:40.967
[in French] May 10th,

37:42.134 --> 37:43.511
1968,

37:44.720 --> 37:46.138
The Night of Barricades.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.556
[in English] What the hell is going on?

37:48.391 --> 37:50.142
[whispering] They were together in Paris.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.687
Students at the Sorbonne.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.774
The Sorbonne. Of course. Why not?

38:00.319 --> 38:01.153
So...

38:01.904 --> 38:03.322
Sergio de Mello.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.575
The revolutionary.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.871
You declared the Sorbonne...

38:11.622 --> 38:13.124
to be the people's university.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.294
Yes, I did.

38:17.878 --> 38:19.463
And I still have a scar

38:19.547 --> 38:21.007
to prove it. Our...

38:21.882 --> 38:24.176
our revolution was crushed.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.721
The choice was to succumb...

38:27.763 --> 38:29.307
or to embrace the armed struggle.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.769
I don't believe in demanding
the impossible anymore,

38:33.853 --> 38:35.604
but I'm going to do the best I can

38:36.230 --> 38:38.107
to bring those refugees back home.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.568
[Sergio] <i>You know what?</i>

38:40.901 --> 38:42.778
It still fascinates me.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.780
Ieng and I...

38:45.489 --> 38:47.325
at a certain point of our lives...

38:48.117 --> 38:49.368
we were very similar.

38:49.702 --> 38:50.745
[Gil scoffs]

38:50.828 --> 38:52.747
You're... you're...

38:52.830 --> 38:53.664
unbelievable.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.000
-We were.
-No, unbelievable.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.170
I have a title for your autobiography.

39:00.713 --> 39:01.714
<i>War Criminals...</i>

39:02.340 --> 39:03.382
<i>My Friends.</i>

39:03.466 --> 39:07.219
[both laughing]

39:11.223 --> 39:12.058
Gil...

39:14.268 --> 39:15.770
you are my conscience.

39:17.021 --> 39:17.855
Yeah.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.611
Well, I wish you'd listen to it sometimes.

39:25.738 --> 39:26.572
More?

39:28.199 --> 39:29.033
Sure.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.119
-Bring the bottle.
-Yes.

39:51.263 --> 39:52.681
[both speaking Portuguese]

39:55.768 --> 39:59.397
[Gaby] This is Sergio de Mello.
He has a meeting with General Gusmao.

40:03.275 --> 40:06.362
No. We don't allow anyone
to meet our leader today.

40:06.445 --> 40:07.446
[exhales]

40:07.530 --> 40:09.907
He's the administrator of East Timor.

40:09.990 --> 40:12.785
No. We not allow anyone
to meet our leader today.

40:13.619 --> 40:14.453
Okay.

40:15.121 --> 40:17.248
[in Portuguese] Good morning.

40:17.748 --> 40:18.582
How are you?

40:18.666 --> 40:19.542
I'm good.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.128
I'm Sergio Vieira de Mello.

40:22.211 --> 40:23.879
I have a meeting scheduled
with General Gusmao

40:23.963 --> 40:24.922
for now.

40:25.005 --> 40:26.507
Could you please tell him I'm here?

40:26.632 --> 40:27.758
[in Portuguese] Wait.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.136
How do you spell your name?

40:30.761 --> 40:31.679
D-E.

40:32.054 --> 40:32.888
D-E.

40:32.972 --> 40:35.182
M-E-L-L-O.

40:35.891 --> 40:36.809
Thank you.

40:36.892 --> 40:37.935
You must wait.

40:41.730 --> 40:43.065
[Gaby in English]
He's a soldier...

40:44.191 --> 40:45.359
just following orders.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.695
[soldiers talking indistinctly]

40:49.947 --> 40:52.032
-[Sergio] This is gonna take forever.
-[Gaby] Yeah.

40:52.575 --> 40:53.868
Gaby, I think I...

40:54.743 --> 40:55.786
I'm going to walk.

40:56.954 --> 40:57.830
Okay.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.874
-I'll find you.
-Just let me know if, uh...

41:02.126 --> 41:04.044
-if he comes back.
-[both laughing]

41:04.503 --> 41:06.088
Okay. I will.

41:18.851 --> 41:20.311
[in Portuguese] Good morning.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.646
-How are you?
-I'm good.

41:22.730 --> 41:23.939
What fruit is this?

41:24.690 --> 41:26.192
It's areca.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.235
That one you chew?

41:28.319 --> 41:31.572
You chew and your mouth gets red.

41:31.655 --> 41:32.781
[speaking Portuguese]

41:33.282 --> 41:34.909
I'd never seen it before.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.285
[woman responds in Portuguese]

41:36.368 --> 41:37.203
Good morning.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.537
[woman responds in Portuguese]

41:44.752 --> 41:45.920

41:47.379 --> 41:48.964
-[speaking Portuguese]
-[Carolina] Sergio.

41:51.800 --> 41:52.635
Hi.

41:52.927 --> 41:54.053
[Carolina chuckles]

41:54.720 --> 41:55.930
What are you doing here?

41:56.805 --> 41:58.224
I should ask you the same.

42:00.643 --> 42:01.727
Well, I'm, um...

42:03.354 --> 42:04.313
I'm...

42:05.272 --> 42:06.106
waiting.

42:08.275 --> 42:09.568
[both laugh]

42:09.735 --> 42:11.820
I'm waiting for the General.

42:13.113 --> 42:14.240
[clears throat]

42:15.449 --> 42:16.492
I see.

42:16.575 --> 42:17.409
Yeah.

42:22.498 --> 42:23.958
How will you win him over?

42:28.796 --> 42:29.672
I don't know.

42:33.342 --> 42:35.261
I really don't. I mean...

42:35.594 --> 42:36.595
[Carolina] Hm.

42:40.516 --> 42:43.686
Well, I think he has to understand
that I'm not his enemy.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.276
I have no idea how to do it.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.361
[chuckles]

42:53.779 --> 42:54.613
Yup.

43:00.703 --> 43:03.497
Listen, I was just about to leave,
but I think...

43:03.914 --> 43:07.001
I think I have to show you something,
if you have time.

43:08.002 --> 43:08.836
Well...

43:09.295 --> 43:11.130
-[both chuckle]
-I think I have time.

43:11.755 --> 43:12.590
Okay.

43:16.176 --> 43:19.054
[Carolina] You know,
sometimes change starts small.

43:21.473 --> 43:25.144
This is the Bobometo Collective,
our pilot project.

43:25.227 --> 43:27.646
We give these women start-up loans.

43:28.689 --> 43:29.898
They do the rest.

43:30.107 --> 43:32.192
People want to work. They want dignity.

43:33.068 --> 43:34.612
-This is Veronica.
-[Sergio] Veronica.

43:34.695 --> 43:36.697
-[Carolina] Claudia.
-[Sergio speaking Portuguese]

43:36.780 --> 43:41.535
And so finally they can earn a living
by doing what they've done for centuries.

43:42.703 --> 43:46.332
This project really shows
the power of microfinance.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.042
Our goal is to have...

43:48.709 --> 43:49.543
[exhales sharply]

43:49.627 --> 43:52.254
many more like this one
around the country.

43:53.130 --> 43:54.298
This is Senhorinha.

43:54.381 --> 43:56.008
[both speaking Portuguese]

43:58.427 --> 44:01.972
She lost everything, including
two sons, killed by the militia.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.307
I'm sorry to hear that.

44:05.934 --> 44:07.519
I think you'd like to talk to her.

44:07.978 --> 44:09.355
She's very special.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.025
Senhorinha.

44:13.942 --> 44:15.152
[in Portuguese]
Good morning. How are you?

44:15.235 --> 44:17.071
[Senhorinha]
Good morning. I'm well.

44:21.742 --> 44:23.160
[introduces himself in Portuguese]

44:23.243 --> 44:24.286
Hi, Sergio.

44:25.537 --> 44:27.081
Are you Portuguese?

44:27.164 --> 44:28.916
No, I'm Brazilian.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.834
Why are you here?

44:30.959 --> 44:35.881
I'm here to administer Timor,

44:36.340 --> 44:38.300
but for a short period.

44:39.009 --> 44:40.135
Welcome.

44:40.886 --> 44:44.223
We have been waiting
for the future to arrive.

44:47.476 --> 44:51.313
What do you want most for your future?

44:53.524 --> 44:55.776
If I tell you what I want...

45:00.614 --> 45:02.741
I don't think you would understand.

45:03.367 --> 45:06.912
Really? I can make an effort to try.

45:08.163 --> 45:09.498
I really want to know.

45:13.001 --> 45:14.461
My whole life...

45:16.338 --> 45:17.840
I worked the land.

45:19.842 --> 45:20.926
Today,

45:22.302 --> 45:23.345
my land,

45:24.638 --> 45:25.931
my family,

45:26.765 --> 45:28.475
they are all dead.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.103
I don't have anything.

45:32.521 --> 45:34.064
You know what I want?

45:37.276 --> 45:39.236
I want to go up into the sky...

45:41.447 --> 45:42.281
[sniffs]

45:42.364 --> 45:44.032
and become a cloud.

45:46.243 --> 45:50.038
Then travel through the sky

45:50.706 --> 45:54.251
to the place where I was born.

45:54.835 --> 45:56.587
And when I get there,

45:57.379 --> 45:59.214
fall like rain.

46:01.467 --> 46:02.634
Then...

46:03.635 --> 46:05.345
stay forever...

46:06.138 --> 46:07.347
on my soil,

46:08.432 --> 46:09.475
on my land.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.019
[Senhorinha sniffles]

46:21.737 --> 46:23.781
I completely understand what you want.

46:25.824 --> 46:26.867
So,

46:27.201 --> 46:29.328
tell the world to see us

46:29.411 --> 46:30.788
the way we are.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.750
We want to be seen.

46:35.125 --> 46:36.126
All of us.

46:36.210 --> 46:37.753
You want to be seen.

46:56.188 --> 46:58.315
-Can I give you a hug?
-[Senhorinha responds in Portuguese]

47:01.985 --> 47:06.698
-Thank you. Thank you.
-[Senhorinha responds in Portuguese]

47:08.534 --> 47:10.661

48:10.679 --> 48:14.641
-I love this rain.
-It rains every day at the same time?

48:15.726 --> 48:17.394
-I was--
-It's the best.

48:18.562 --> 48:19.688
Listen, um,

48:19.938 --> 48:21.064
I was...

48:21.148 --> 48:22.357
I was really impressed.

Thank you.

-Thank you.
-[Gaby] Sergio!

Thank you.

48:28.614 --> 48:29.781
-Thank you.
-Sergio!

48:32.200 --> 48:34.369
I have a message from General Gusmao.

48:37.623 --> 48:39.166
-I'll wait in the car.
-Yeah.

49:02.814 --> 49:04.816
[thunder rumbles]

49:12.783 --> 49:15.994
He wants the president of Indonesia
to apologize.

49:16.078 --> 49:17.913
For 24 years of war.

49:18.497 --> 49:19.331
And...

49:20.374 --> 49:23.377
he wants full independence for East Timor.

49:30.926 --> 49:32.219
It's impossible.

This is Gil. He's lucid. BP, 100/60.

Both pinned from the hips down.

53:08.894 --> 53:10.729

-[Sergio] Please, not now.
-Wait, Sergio.

55:40.045 --> 55:43.298
I did not come halfway around the world

Go on.

55:48.136 --> 55:51.681
From a Timorese rebel
with a high school education.

55:53.099 --> 55:55.352
We were sent here to run East Timor.

55:55.435 --> 55:57.645
-We were sent here to run...
-We know what we're doing.

55:58.021 --> 56:00.398

56:00.482 --> 56:04.527
Oh, I see. So we all give up power
to the Timorese, except for you.

-Is that it?
-If you don't like it...

56:06.112 --> 56:07.322
-I don't like it.
-...you're free to go.

-I don't like it.

56:11.034 --> 56:12.327
All right, everyone.

56:20.418 --> 56:21.252
So...

56:24.422 --> 56:27.092
We were sent here as overlords.

56:28.968 --> 56:30.095
But I really hope...

56:30.678 --> 56:32.931
we can leave as respected colleagues.

From now on,

56:37.352 --> 56:40.355
we take our orders directly from you.

56:41.940 --> 56:43.942

1:17:06.246 --> 1:17:07.664
Any other city in the world

1:17:08.206 --> 1:17:10.500
and these guys are evac'd by now,
you know that.

1:17:10.584 --> 1:17:11.460
What a shitshow.

1:17:18.216 --> 1:17:19.134
Bill...

1:17:20.969 --> 1:17:22.804
There's nothing else coming...

1:17:23.430 --> 1:17:24.264
is there?

1:17:26.433 --> 1:17:27.893
It doesn't look that way, no.

1:17:57.839 --> 1:17:59.966
So what actually happened?

1:18:02.177 --> 1:18:03.303
Don't know.

1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:07.641
Truck bomb.

1:18:10.185 --> 1:18:11.895
But why the UN?

1:18:14.773 --> 1:18:15.774
Soft target.

1:18:22.447 --> 1:18:23.448
[sighing]

1:18:30.872 --> 1:18:33.083
Keep it moving. Come on.

1:18:38.755 --> 1:18:41.007
[indistinct radio chatter]

1:18:44.970 --> 1:18:46.638
It doesn't look very welcoming...

1:18:47.305 --> 1:18:48.181
does it?

1:18:50.308 --> 1:18:53.103
This is Baghdad, Sergio, not Saint-Tropez.

1:19:00.736 --> 1:19:01.737
Stay here.

1:19:02.988 --> 1:19:03.822
Sergio.

1:19:04.823 --> 1:19:05.657
Hey.

1:19:07.659 --> 1:19:08.618
[Gil] What's he doing?

1:19:08.702 --> 1:19:09.661
[soldier] Welcome, sir.

1:19:09.786 --> 1:19:12.998
[Sergio speaking indistinctly]

1:19:13.707 --> 1:19:15.709
-[soldier] Absolutely.
-I'm sure you understand.

1:19:15.834 --> 1:19:17.836
[soldier]
Yes, sir. All right, on me!

1:19:19.963 --> 1:19:21.131
[gate creaks]

1:19:26.887 --> 1:19:27.971
[sighing]

1:19:28.054 --> 1:19:29.014
They want us out.

1:19:29.097 --> 1:19:30.474
-Who wants us out?
-The UN guy.

1:19:30.557 --> 1:19:32.225
He says he doesn't want
the locals to think

1:19:32.309 --> 1:19:33.977
the UN is part of the occupation.

1:19:34.060 --> 1:19:35.645
We wouldn't want that, would we?

1:19:36.438 --> 1:19:37.272
Snipers too.

1:19:37.355 --> 1:19:38.482
[Bill] Snipers too?

1:19:38.815 --> 1:19:39.649
Okay.

1:19:48.325 --> 1:19:49.743
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:19:52.204 --> 1:19:53.205
Is that all you got?

1:19:53.789 --> 1:19:55.499
[man] <i>Sorry, boss. That's it. </i>

1:19:56.416 --> 1:19:59.002
-[scoffing]
-Don't you love the army?

1:19:59.085 --> 1:20:00.545
[Sergio] Are you fucking kidding me?

1:20:00.629 --> 1:20:02.839
The most powerful army on earth...

1:20:03.757 --> 1:20:05.133
and this is the best you can do?

1:20:06.551 --> 1:20:10.555
The best they could do was to put tanks
guarding our headquarters.

1:20:10.639 --> 1:20:11.640
[Bill] Take it up!

1:20:12.724 --> 1:20:15.852
-What the fuck were you thinking?
-What the fuck are you talking about?

1:20:15.936 --> 1:20:17.270
You weren't thinking.

1:20:17.854 --> 1:20:19.689
The moment we got to Baghdad,

1:20:20.816 --> 1:20:22.442
you put all our lives at risk.

1:20:22.526 --> 1:20:23.985
I made a decision.

1:20:24.069 --> 1:20:25.320
[Gil] Good decision, Sergio.

1:20:25.403 --> 1:20:26.863
Which is more than you ever do.

1:20:26.947 --> 1:20:27.781
Fuck you.

1:20:27.864 --> 1:20:30.325
-Fuck you.
-Everybody try to stay positive, okay?

1:20:30.408 --> 1:20:34.120
We'll try to stay positive
as you fill your purse with rocks.

1:20:36.122 --> 1:20:37.541
Fuck you, Gil.

1:20:37.749 --> 1:20:38.583
Fuck!

1:20:40.544 --> 1:20:42.212
[screams in frustration]

1:20:42.295 --> 1:20:44.714
[soldier yelling] Let's go!
Start it up!

1:20:45.465 --> 1:20:48.510
Sergio, did you really just tell
the guards to leave?

1:20:48.802 --> 1:20:49.928
I did, Lynn, yes.

1:20:50.011 --> 1:20:52.848
[in French] We need to assess
the security situation.

1:20:52.931 --> 1:20:55.767
I take full responsibility.

1:20:56.977 --> 1:20:58.562
Full responsibility.

1:21:00.647 --> 1:21:02.524
[in English] Qabush,
can you please close the door?

1:21:04.901 --> 1:21:06.069
We have no choice

1:21:06.653 --> 1:21:08.196
but to work with the Americans.

1:21:09.990 --> 1:21:11.241
But we cannot hide

1:21:11.658 --> 1:21:13.368
behind their wall of armor.

1:21:15.537 --> 1:21:16.538
I must say...

1:21:17.205 --> 1:21:18.081
it's now...

1:21:18.915 --> 1:21:20.709
more clear to me than ever

1:21:21.418 --> 1:21:22.377
why we're here...

1:21:23.420 --> 1:21:26.631
and why I asked you, my colleagues,
my friends, to join me on this mission

1:21:26.715 --> 1:21:29.843
and why this mission requires
the very best...

1:21:30.468 --> 1:21:32.429
of the United Nations diplomatic corps.

1:21:34.264 --> 1:21:36.474
We are not here to fix Iraq...

1:21:39.144 --> 1:21:40.979
or to tell its people what to do.

1:21:42.522 --> 1:21:45.400
We have to face the Iraqi people openly.

1:21:46.359 --> 1:21:49.321
Openly as ourselves, as the United Nations
because this is who we are.

1:21:50.739 --> 1:21:52.866
And this is what we do best.

1:21:55.285 --> 1:21:58.663
All right.
Do you have our election templates?

1:21:58.747 --> 1:22:00.373
From Timor and Kosovo. We're ready.

1:22:01.541 --> 1:22:02.709
All right, everyone.

1:22:04.127 --> 1:22:05.128
Let's do this.

1:22:06.504 --> 1:22:07.631
[inhales deeply]

1:22:07.756 --> 1:22:08.590
Enjoy Baghdad.

1:22:10.050 --> 1:22:12.052
[wind whistling]

1:22:13.345 --> 1:22:14.846
[debris falling]

1:22:15.138 --> 1:22:16.097
[Sergio] Gil?

1:22:17.557 --> 1:22:18.433
Huh?

1:22:19.392 --> 1:22:20.310
I'm sorry.

1:22:25.941 --> 1:22:27.233
I'm so fucking sorry.

1:22:30.195 --> 1:22:31.655
[Gil] I'm sorry too.

1:22:32.113 --> 1:22:33.239
You were right.

1:22:34.491 --> 1:22:35.367
[Gil] No.

1:22:36.576 --> 1:22:37.702
I'm so sorry.

1:22:39.996 --> 1:22:40.997
Thank you, Sergio.

1:22:46.336 --> 1:22:47.212
[Gil grunting]

1:23:09.484 --> 1:23:11.861
[tense music playing]

1:23:28.586 --> 1:23:30.922
[loud whooshing]

1:23:33.758 --> 1:23:34.592
[soldier] Sir.

1:23:34.676 --> 1:23:36.136
-Military police.
-Captain.

1:23:36.553 --> 1:23:38.680
I just want to let you know
we found Sergio inside.

1:23:39.180 --> 1:23:40.473
-Is he alive?
-He's alive, sir.

1:23:41.141 --> 1:23:43.351
Let's get him out. Get him out.

1:23:43.435 --> 1:23:46.062
[men speaking indistinctly]

1:23:46.813 --> 1:23:48.023
Your team get him out...

1:23:48.481 --> 1:23:50.942
[Blitzer] <i>How big of an explosion,</i>
<i>in other words, was this?</i>

1:23:52.277 --> 1:23:56.364
<i>Well, the UN building in the Canal Hotel</i>
<i>is quite separate from other buildings. </i>

1:23:56.448 --> 1:23:59.242
<i>The area is fairly, um...</i>

1:23:59.492 --> 1:24:01.327
-[Blitzer] <i>Mr. Marshall--</i>
<i>-It has a few--</i>

1:24:01.411 --> 1:24:03.538
<i>Hold on one second because Paul Bremer,</i>

1:24:03.621 --> 1:24:06.416
<i>the Chief US Administrator in Iraq,</i>
<i>is speaking right now,</i>

1:24:06.499 --> 1:24:08.752
<i>and I want our viewers to hear</i>
<i>what he has to say.</i>

1:24:08.835 --> 1:24:12.464
As of this time, my dear friend Sergio...

1:24:13.006 --> 1:24:14.966
is, uh, somewhere...

1:24:15.967 --> 1:24:19.554
back there. We're doing everything we can
to get him out.

1:24:19.637 --> 1:24:22.474
He may well have been
the target of this attack

1:24:22.557 --> 1:24:25.852
which will only strengthen our resolve
to fight terror...

1:24:26.728 --> 1:24:28.063
wherever we find it.

1:24:28.146 --> 1:24:29.939
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1:24:31.149 --> 1:24:32.901
As soon as we know anything,<i> </i>uh,

1:24:33.568 --> 1:24:34.694
we'll let you know.

1:24:34.986 --> 1:24:36.863
[reporters talking indistinctly]

1:24:36.946 --> 1:24:39.991
[structure rumbling]

1:24:41.785 --> 1:24:44.079
-[Andre] Are you okay?
-It's getting harder to breathe.

1:24:44.704 --> 1:24:45.705
I know, pal.

1:24:46.623 --> 1:24:48.333
I need you to understand something.

1:24:49.834 --> 1:24:51.377
[exhales]
What we need to do...

1:24:51.836 --> 1:24:53.129
to get you out of here...

1:24:53.922 --> 1:24:56.508
[Bill] We're going to have to amputate
both your legs, Gil.

1:24:56.966 --> 1:24:57.884
I know.

1:24:58.718 --> 1:25:02.013
I've already given you the maximum dose
of morphine. Any more and it'd kill you.

1:25:04.599 --> 1:25:06.726
You do whatever it takes to get us out.

1:25:09.729 --> 1:25:11.606
[tearfully]
Get me back to my family.

1:25:13.983 --> 1:25:14.818
[Bill] Yes, sir.

1:25:15.235 --> 1:25:16.236
All right, buddy.

1:25:17.237 --> 1:25:18.780
We'll get you out of here.

1:25:19.656 --> 1:25:20.698
Okay.

1:25:21.157 --> 1:25:23.076
-[whimpering]
-[Bill] We'll get you out of here.

1:25:24.661 --> 1:25:26.204
[straps tightening]

1:25:34.087 --> 1:25:35.296
[Andre] All right, now.

1:25:35.380 --> 1:25:38.091
-Wait, wait! Wait!
-[Andre] Hold it.

1:25:38.174 --> 1:25:39.884
-Okay.
-[Gil breathing rapidly in panic]

1:25:39.968 --> 1:25:41.511
-Gil--
-Shh!

1:25:41.636 --> 1:25:43.429
Do you wanna shut up?

1:25:43.513 --> 1:25:44.889
Wait. Wait.

1:25:45.765 --> 1:25:46.683
Wait.

1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:48.643
Just wait.

1:25:49.435 --> 1:25:50.854
[sobs]

1:25:56.359 --> 1:25:57.360
[Andre] Forgive me.

1:26:08.246 --> 1:26:09.080
[sawing]

1:26:09.164 --> 1:26:10.832
[screaming]

1:26:12.125 --> 1:26:14.627
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:26:14.711 --> 1:26:17.046
[sawing continues]

1:26:21.009 --> 1:26:22.010
I'm sorry.

1:26:23.094 --> 1:26:24.888
[sawing continues]

1:26:26.347 --> 1:26:27.265
I'm sorry.

[birds chirping]

1:26:43.573 --> 1:26:45.491
[debris shifting]

1:26:45.575 --> 1:26:48.494
[Bill] One, two, three, go.

1:26:49.829 --> 1:26:51.331
-Stay right there.
-[Andre] All right.

1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:52.874
Sergio,

1:26:53.750 --> 1:26:54.834
I'm coming back for you.

1:26:55.543 --> 1:26:56.711
Just give me a minute.

1:26:58.046 --> 1:26:59.547
Okay. Stay there.

1:27:00.173 --> 1:27:01.132
All right. All right.

1:27:04.052 --> 1:27:05.011
Okay, one...

1:27:05.094 --> 1:27:06.971
[Bill grunts with effort]

1:27:07.805 --> 1:27:09.599
-Pull us up.
-[Andre and Bill grunting with effort]

1:27:12.310 --> 1:27:13.895
[Sergio] Go home, my friend.

1:27:17.899 --> 1:27:18.900
Go home.

1:28:08.032 --> 1:28:10.285
[approaching vehicle engine]

1:28:27.135 --> 1:28:28.761
-Can you just wait for a minute?
-[driver] Yes.

1:28:28.886 --> 1:28:30.596
-Of course. Sure.
-A minute. Thank you.

1:28:34.976 --> 1:28:36.561
-[thunder rumbling]
-Hello.

1:28:38.354 --> 1:28:39.439
Thanks for coming.

1:28:41.274 --> 1:28:42.650
Tomorrow's the big day.

1:28:45.486 --> 1:28:46.863
You must be very proud.

1:28:49.324 --> 1:28:50.158
I am.

1:28:53.494 --> 1:28:55.621
So, you say you have some papers for me?

1:28:56.205 --> 1:28:57.206
Yes, I do.

1:28:59.917 --> 1:29:00.960
[Carolina] Mm-hmm.

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:17.894
[thunder rumbling faintly]

1:29:46.047 --> 1:29:47.298
[exhales nervously]

1:30:05.817 --> 1:30:08.194
"All is an interminable chain of longing."

1:30:09.570 --> 1:30:11.656
[thunder rumbling]

1:30:12.490 --> 1:30:14.117
Sergio, this is beautiful.

1:30:15.952 --> 1:30:16.911
Of course.

1:30:20.790 --> 1:30:22.125
[snickers]

1:30:27.880 --> 1:30:28.714
But...

1:30:30.591 --> 1:30:32.385
can you tell me right now...

1:30:33.302 --> 1:30:35.346
right now, what do you want?

1:30:37.807 --> 1:30:38.808
Can you say that?

1:30:42.979 --> 1:30:44.147
There's this...

1:30:44.939 --> 1:30:45.815
spot...

1:30:48.317 --> 1:30:49.152
in Rio...

1:30:50.862 --> 1:30:53.948
where an outcropping of rocks
meets the sea at...

1:30:54.657 --> 1:30:55.825
Ipanema Beach.

1:30:58.911 --> 1:31:00.079
It's called...

1:31:00.913 --> 1:31:01.998
Arpoador.

1:31:03.499 --> 1:31:05.460
This is a place where my father...

1:31:06.127 --> 1:31:07.253
used to take me

1:31:07.753 --> 1:31:09.005
when I was a child.

1:31:10.089 --> 1:31:11.299
And it's a place...

1:31:12.300 --> 1:31:15.720
still today I return the moment
I arrive in Rio.

1:31:16.804 --> 1:31:19.474
[rain falling gently]

1:31:20.600 --> 1:31:21.976
I want to go back home.

1:31:24.604 --> 1:31:26.105
I want to go back to Brazil.

1:31:28.107 --> 1:31:29.275
To Arpoador.

1:31:32.236 --> 1:31:33.613
I want to stop...

1:31:34.697 --> 1:31:37.408
being what people expect me to be.

1:31:38.618 --> 1:31:40.077
It seems easy, but...

1:31:42.163 --> 1:31:44.332
it's not an easy thing for me to do.

1:31:50.254 --> 1:31:52.507
-You should go and do that.
-Wait.

1:31:55.092 --> 1:31:55.968
Look at me.

1:32:00.681 --> 1:32:03.142
I want to see this country independent...

1:32:03.768 --> 1:32:04.769
and free.
