00:01.833 --> 00:03.375
Previously on "The Americans."

00:03.500 --> 00:05.966
<i>Philip, I'd like you</i>
<i>to meet Elizabeth.</i>

00:06.034 --> 00:07.396
There is so much to talk about.

00:07.521 --> 00:09.709
Philip and Elizabeth's lives.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.747
Not the other ones...
Those should never be discussed.

00:11.815 --> 00:13.716
Super-secret spies
living next door.

00:13.784 --> 00:15.919
They look like us, they speak
better English than we do.

00:15.987 --> 00:18.155
They're not allowed to say a single
word in Russian once they get here.

00:18.223 --> 00:21.125
Oh, hi. You came! Just for a second,
to, uh, bring over brownies

00:21.193 --> 00:22.360
and welcome you
to the neighborhood.

00:22.429 --> 00:23.496
What do you do, Stan?

00:23.563 --> 00:24.730
I'm an FBI agent.

00:26.133 --> 00:28.659
Defecting to America?
America's not so bad.

00:28.727 --> 00:30.393
The electricity works all
the time. Food's pretty great.

00:30.461 --> 00:31.894
Is that what you care about?

00:31.961 --> 00:33.560
No, I care about everything.
Not the motherland!

00:33.628 --> 00:34.761
I do, but our family
comes first.

00:34.829 --> 00:36.428
Sorry.
I never meant to hurt you.

00:36.496 --> 00:38.896
What are you talking about?

00:38.964 --> 00:40.966
How did he hurt you?

00:41.034 --> 00:43.670
Do what you want with him.

00:43.738 --> 00:46.306
The orders
are going to change now.

00:46.374 --> 00:47.975
The risks are
going to be greater.

00:48.042 --> 00:49.877
We won't let you down, general.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.562 --> 01:12.232
Mm, Scott.

01:20.976 --> 01:21.976
What should I do?

01:30.683 --> 01:33.551
Forget him, Annelise.

01:33.619 --> 01:35.521
I'm here now.

01:35.588 --> 01:38.156
And I'm all yours.

01:38.224 --> 01:41.226
She's not cut out for this.
She's been good so far.

01:41.294 --> 01:43.662
Telling me things her husband
says, probing him a little.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.264
This is
a whole different thing.

01:45.332 --> 01:48.034
General Zhukov
said it would get riskier now.

01:48.101 --> 01:49.603
Riskier? We're sending her
into a lion's den.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.805
She knows how to get men
to turn their brains off.

01:51.873 --> 01:55.610
That is no small skill.
It's brought down empires.

01:55.677 --> 01:57.278
She doesn't care about empires.

01:57.346 --> 01:58.980
She cares about
Scott Birkeland,

01:59.048 --> 02:03.251
patriotic Swedish intelligence
officer, and that is enough.

02:03.319 --> 02:04.653
I'm not sure she cares
about him, either.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.321
She's half off her rocker.

02:14.231 --> 02:18.302
The K-19 class was deployed in
'60 but retrofitted last year.

02:18.370 --> 02:19.838
They're not obsolete.

02:19.905 --> 02:22.207
They didn't say obsolete.
They said the Akula class

02:22.275 --> 02:24.443
carried twice as many warheads
and had twice the range.

02:24.511 --> 02:25.978
So, why should we develop
countermeasures

02:26.046 --> 02:27.279
against the K-19?

02:27.347 --> 02:29.649
I don't think the K-19
was retrofitted.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.752
I think it <i>was</i> retrofitted.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.653
But I'm gonna go
look it up for you.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.192
My wife is almost never wrong.

02:38.259 --> 02:42.630
If the Soviets get nuclear
missiles into Nicaragua,

02:42.697 --> 02:45.566
people won't be talking about
the K-19s parked in our doorway

02:45.634 --> 02:47.368
much longer anyway.

03:13.432 --> 03:17.468
Excuse me, ma'am.

03:17.536 --> 03:18.937
What are you doing in here?

03:19.004 --> 03:21.306
Oh, I was just going to
look something up.

03:21.374 --> 03:25.845
This area is off limits.
Would you come with us, please?

03:30.017 --> 03:31.618
She'll be all right.

03:31.685 --> 03:33.853
Well, if she's not,

03:33.921 --> 03:37.023
I'm walking into a room
full of FBI agents.

03:59.849 --> 04:01.950
Oh, my God. You won't believe
what just happened.

04:02.018 --> 04:04.419
They questioned me, Scott...
Two of them.

04:04.487 --> 04:06.021
Of course, they couldn't stop

04:06.089 --> 04:07.723
staring at my tits
the whole time,

04:07.791 --> 04:09.458
but when I told them
that my husband

04:09.525 --> 04:11.293
was the deputy
under secretary of defense,

04:11.361 --> 04:13.962
they were like, "uh-oh."

04:14.030 --> 04:16.130
Smile.

04:16.197 --> 04:18.666
But I did it so perfect.

04:18.733 --> 04:22.604
I waited just like we talked
about so it didn't seem forced,

04:22.671 --> 04:25.407
almost like
I didn't want to use that.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.043
And they apologized to me.

04:28.111 --> 04:29.446
You're incredible. Mm-hmm.

04:31.716 --> 04:33.784
Mm.

04:33.852 --> 04:38.223
Scott, the way
you make me feel... it's so...

04:38.291 --> 04:40.659
I've been with a lot of guys.

04:40.726 --> 04:41.960
It hasn't always been Douglas.

04:42.028 --> 04:43.795
But with you, it's...
It's different.

04:43.863 --> 04:48.099
You're... you're special.
I think you're the one.

04:48.167 --> 04:51.136
I love you.

04:55.408 --> 04:58.342
I love you, too.

04:58.410 --> 05:00.578
God.

05:00.646 --> 05:02.981
I need you inside me so badly.

05:33.673 --> 05:35.256
[sighs) What a day.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.957
You hear Reagan
ranting and raving.

05:39.025 --> 05:41.193
I mean, he's crazy.

05:41.261 --> 05:43.629
The man literally
wants to destroy us.

05:43.697 --> 05:45.154
This is what it's gonna
be like from now on.

05:45.466 --> 05:46.999
Well, we can handle it.

05:47.067 --> 05:50.402
I just don't like
asking our people to do it.

05:50.470 --> 05:51.581
There. The clock.

05:51.706 --> 05:52.931
Yeah, that'll work.

05:53.907 --> 05:55.308
What do you think the plan is?

05:55.376 --> 05:56.910
Uh, develop someone
on the inside...

05:56.977 --> 05:58.178
Six, seven months.

05:58.245 --> 05:59.612
They get it out.
I say we have a day,

05:59.680 --> 06:01.381
maybe more until anyone
realizes it's gone.

06:01.449 --> 06:02.983
Then, we put it back.

06:06.123 --> 06:07.655
You never said
she looked like that.

06:08.306 --> 06:09.473
Yeah, I did.

06:10.290 --> 06:11.590
Not like that.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.490
Well, she's not always
dressed like that.

06:21.103 --> 06:23.672
A year from now, and he's done.

06:23.740 --> 06:25.741
It was a lateral move.

06:25.809 --> 06:27.209
They can cut your balls off,
stuff them in your mouth,

06:27.276 --> 06:28.610
tie you to a radiator
in a basement,

06:28.678 --> 06:30.913
and then call it
a lateral move.

06:30.981 --> 06:33.015
Bartholomew took the fall
for Timoshev.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.817
Well, they did make him
deputy chief

06:34.885 --> 06:36.485
of the biggest division
in the Bureau.

06:36.553 --> 06:38.087
Yeah, he's working for a guy
whose ass he'll be sucking

06:38.155 --> 06:39.422
till he can't take it anymore.

06:39.489 --> 06:42.525
Well, that was fast.

06:42.593 --> 06:45.161
Maybe it was on order.
She's just picking it up.

06:45.229 --> 06:47.964
And they gift-wrapped it
in 15 seconds?

06:48.032 --> 06:49.399
Let's take a look.

06:49.467 --> 06:51.334
Stan, we're supposed to
stay with her.

06:51.402 --> 06:52.702
Stan!

06:52.770 --> 06:56.072
Hey, how you doing?

06:56.140 --> 06:59.642
Fine. Yourself? Good. Thanks.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.210
Hey, what can you tell me
about that lady

07:01.278 --> 07:02.812
that was just in here?

07:02.879 --> 07:05.080
Not a damn thing.

07:05.148 --> 07:08.350
Sir, we just have a few
questions, like what'd she buy?

07:08.418 --> 07:09.885
What's her name?

07:09.953 --> 07:13.189
Maybe I wasn't clear.
I... I sell stereos.

07:13.256 --> 07:15.524
If you're interested in a stereo,
I can help you with that.

07:15.592 --> 07:17.726
I'm interested
in this stereo right here.

07:20.864 --> 07:24.333
It's a tx-470 mid-range
recei... hey.

07:24.401 --> 07:26.235
You can't go back there.

07:26.303 --> 07:28.471
Sir, I'm just looking for
a little cooperation here.

07:28.539 --> 07:29.906
And how are you gonna get it?

07:29.973 --> 07:32.608
Oh, I don't know.

07:32.676 --> 07:34.944
Should we beat him senseless?

07:35.012 --> 07:36.445
I don't know. He's kind of big.

07:36.513 --> 07:37.780
I said you can't be back here.

07:37.848 --> 07:40.183
This is private property.
Look at this.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.384
Put that back.

07:41.452 --> 07:43.920
"Ruska... ruska yuh."

07:43.988 --> 07:45.622
What, six years of Russian,
and this is what you got?

07:45.690 --> 07:47.491
I got this. I got this.
I said, "put that back."

07:47.559 --> 07:49.960
"Ruska yuh buhlu." It's caviar.

07:50.028 --> 07:51.595
Do you mind if I open this?

07:51.663 --> 07:53.030
Yeah, I mi... hey!

08:00.339 --> 08:03.208
That is very fancy stuff.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.742
Hmm.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.778
And you don't know the woman
who was in here, huh?

08:06.846 --> 08:08.379
No.

08:11.016 --> 08:14.118
Hey. Give me that back.

08:14.186 --> 08:17.054
You can't do this.
This is crap.

09:48.178 --> 09:50.780
Three days? When
he said things would get riskier,

09:50.847 --> 09:52.481
I guess this is what he meant.

09:52.549 --> 09:53.882
Well, no, this is isn't risky.
This is insane.

09:53.950 --> 09:55.484
We need six months
for this at least.

09:55.552 --> 09:57.486
Philip. Wha... no, I'll
send a flash tonight

09:57.554 --> 09:59.621
saying it's operationally impossible.
These are orders, Philip.

09:59.689 --> 10:01.890
Yeah, and they'll listen to us because
we're the ones on the ground.

10:01.958 --> 10:04.092
They understand
what they're asking.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.061
You have a lot
of confidence in them.

10:06.129 --> 10:08.597
Think how important this must be
for them to ask this.

10:08.665 --> 10:10.498
You want to do it?
I don't want to.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.734
I think if they're asking,
it must be necessary.

10:12.802 --> 10:15.136
We would be exposed
from the first meeting.

10:15.204 --> 10:16.571
We don't know anything
about the target.

10:16.639 --> 10:17.806
How are we supposed to
get her to do it

10:17.874 --> 10:19.074
without understanding her?

10:19.142 --> 10:20.408
We'll make adjustments
as we go.

10:20.476 --> 10:21.910
Are you being serious?

10:21.978 --> 10:24.679
Zhukov said
things would change.

10:24.747 --> 10:26.014
Here we are.

10:26.082 --> 10:27.949
Elizabeth, this is crazy.

10:28.017 --> 10:31.519
We have no choice.

11:04.755 --> 11:07.624
Ow! Sorry!

11:07.691 --> 11:09.425
That's all right, miss.

11:09.493 --> 11:12.795
So sorry.

11:15.065 --> 11:15.965
Thank you.

11:24.508 --> 11:26.309
Dinner time.

11:26.376 --> 11:27.677
It's hot.

11:27.744 --> 11:29.145
And don't start
with the pie this time.

11:29.213 --> 11:31.481
What? You let me eat
the pie first last time!

11:31.549 --> 11:32.816
I know, and that was a mistake.

11:33.884 --> 11:35.351
Hey, mom. Hi.

11:35.419 --> 11:36.953
Did you finish
the Krazinski package?

11:37.021 --> 11:38.555
Yes. All right.

11:38.622 --> 11:40.289
Try not to give Carla
any trouble, Paige.

11:40.357 --> 11:41.857
Ha ha.

11:41.925 --> 11:44.326
Where did you get that?

11:44.394 --> 11:46.262
The mall.

11:48.031 --> 11:51.534
It's just a bra, mom. I'm 13.

11:51.602 --> 11:53.202
E-exactly.

11:53.270 --> 11:56.072
Mom, things are different
than when you grew up.

11:56.139 --> 11:58.374
People are, like, freer.

11:59.743 --> 12:02.045
We'll see about that.
Goodnight.

12:02.113 --> 12:03.513
Have a good time.

12:03.581 --> 12:05.816
Goodnight, mom. Goodnight.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.194
Hello. Can I help you
with something?

12:17.262 --> 12:18.663
We need to talk about your son.

12:18.731 --> 12:21.566
Is there something wrong? Yes.

12:21.634 --> 12:24.369
No... excuse me! Excuse me!

12:24.436 --> 12:26.237
Sir, you can't just come
into my house like this.

12:26.305 --> 12:28.006
I'm sorry... can I help you
with something?

12:28.074 --> 12:31.543
Viola, is anyone else here? No.

12:31.610 --> 12:33.378
Can I help you?!
Excuse me, I...

12:33.446 --> 12:35.280
Viola, I have to explain
something very difficult to you,

12:35.348 --> 12:36.815
and you will be upset
when I tell you,

12:36.882 --> 12:38.550
but I will help you.

12:38.617 --> 12:39.985
And that's the most important
thing to understand.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.920
Who are you? We'll get to that.

12:41.988 --> 12:43.121
First, I have to tell you
the simple fact.

12:43.189 --> 12:44.389
Grayson's been poisoned.

12:44.457 --> 12:46.658
That's why he isn't
feeling well.

12:46.726 --> 12:48.293
By morning, his fever
will be spiking,

12:48.361 --> 12:50.095
but it won't come down
no matter what you do.

12:50.162 --> 12:52.497
He's been given
a specially made formula

12:52.565 --> 12:54.266
that only has one antidote.

12:54.334 --> 12:55.935
It's a liquid that I can
inject into him

12:56.002 --> 12:57.570
that'll make him
completely better.

12:57.638 --> 13:00.373
No one else has this antidote.

13:00.441 --> 13:01.975
If you take him to the hospital,
they don't have it.

13:02.043 --> 13:04.244
The greatest doctor in the world
can't make it.

13:04.312 --> 13:05.745
Only I can give it to him,
and I will.

13:05.813 --> 13:07.047
Do you understand?

13:07.115 --> 13:08.682
If I give it to him,
he will be fine.

13:08.749 --> 13:11.652
But if I don't,
he'll die in 72 hours.

13:11.719 --> 13:13.020
That's exactly what'll happen

13:13.088 --> 13:14.154
if you don't do
what I tell you to do.

13:14.222 --> 13:16.023
Why are you doing this?

13:16.091 --> 13:20.027
I need something from you,
and it's a little thing really.

13:20.095 --> 13:23.431
I need you to go
to your boss's study tomorrow

13:23.499 --> 13:25.566
and take the little, electric
clock from the bookshelf

13:25.634 --> 13:27.234
and bring it to me.

13:27.302 --> 13:29.470
I will then need you
to put it back,

13:29.538 --> 13:31.472
and that is it... one, two.

13:31.540 --> 13:33.774
I will give Grayson the
antidote. He will get better.

13:33.842 --> 13:36.510
You'll never tell anyone
about this,

13:36.578 --> 13:38.545
and we'll all live
happily ever after.

13:38.613 --> 13:40.747
My nurse will stay with him
during the day

13:40.815 --> 13:43.383
while you're at work
so you don't have to worry.

13:43.451 --> 13:45.619
Water. Viola. Viola.

13:45.687 --> 13:50.356
If you talk to anyone,
if you tell anyone,

13:50.424 --> 13:51.858
if you have me arrested,

13:51.926 --> 13:54.127
I do not carry
the antidote with me.

13:54.194 --> 13:56.796
My people will give it to me
once this is all over.

13:56.864 --> 13:59.132
So, if anything happens to me,
he will die.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.967
But don't worry.
It's very simple.

14:01.034 --> 14:03.603
Do as I say...
He gets better. One, two.

14:03.671 --> 14:06.907
No. No, you give it to him now.

14:06.974 --> 14:09.509
Give it to him now!
Give him the antidote now!

14:09.577 --> 14:11.445
Help!

14:13.447 --> 14:16.583
It's okay. It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.

14:16.650 --> 14:18.518
It's okay. Can you quiet down?

14:18.586 --> 14:20.454
Mm-hmm.

14:20.521 --> 14:23.523
I understand. Really, I do.

14:23.591 --> 14:26.860
So, let me help you
get through this, please?

14:26.928 --> 14:29.129
Will you let me help
you and your family

14:29.197 --> 14:30.096
get through this?

14:35.002 --> 14:37.937
Okay.

14:38.005 --> 14:41.541
Good. Good.

14:41.609 --> 14:44.811
God. God will help us.

14:44.879 --> 14:48.048
Please, God. Oh, please, lord.

14:48.115 --> 14:50.384
Please, help.

14:50.452 --> 14:52.453
Please.

14:52.521 --> 14:54.255
That's my boy.

14:54.322 --> 14:56.690
That's my boy.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.948
She said God will help us.

15:09.073 --> 15:09.573
It's not good.

15:09.698 --> 15:11.665
People who believe in God
always make the worst targets.

15:11.733 --> 15:14.601
She believed you.
That's what's important.

15:14.669 --> 15:16.703
Agent Beeman's car is now back.

15:16.771 --> 15:18.438
I wonder what
<i>he's</i> up to tonight.

15:18.506 --> 15:20.974
You worried?

15:21.042 --> 15:22.776
No, I just think...

15:22.844 --> 15:26.012
We're in for some late hours
on this one, and...

15:26.080 --> 15:27.447
I just wish
I knew his schedule.

15:28.983 --> 15:30.383
I try not
to cross him too many times

15:30.451 --> 15:31.718
in the middle of the night.

15:31.785 --> 15:34.053
You think
he's still suspicious?

15:34.121 --> 15:36.523
He's not acting like it,

15:36.591 --> 15:39.994
but maybe he's
the world's greatest actor.

15:40.061 --> 15:41.629
I still wish I'd seen him.

15:41.697 --> 15:44.298
Trust me.

15:44.366 --> 15:46.868
When he saw the trunk was clean,
the look on his face...

15:46.936 --> 15:49.838
He thought he was
a complete fool.

15:49.906 --> 15:51.207
And you know what?

15:51.275 --> 15:52.408
If it was more
than a crazy hunch,

15:52.476 --> 15:53.876
there'd be
a whole FBI team in here,

15:53.944 --> 15:56.079
not just one guy
with a flashlight

15:56.147 --> 15:57.748
who thought we were asleep.

15:57.815 --> 15:59.316
Still, some crazy hunch.

16:04.422 --> 16:08.793
Obviously, he's no fool,
but I think he's moved on.

16:08.861 --> 16:10.594
All right? I think we're okay.

16:10.662 --> 16:13.998
So, let's just...
Try not to run into him

16:14.065 --> 16:15.833
too many times
at 4:00 in the morning,

16:15.900 --> 16:18.068
make him wonder
what travel agents are doing up

16:18.136 --> 16:22.640
in the middle of the night.

16:25.744 --> 16:28.146
Henry.

16:28.214 --> 16:31.549
Henry would adjust...
To anything.

16:31.617 --> 16:33.551
Don't you think? If he had to?

16:33.619 --> 16:36.221
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:36.288 --> 16:39.358
If something happened to us.

16:39.426 --> 16:42.294
He'd find his way.

16:44.497 --> 16:48.866
But Paige, I...

16:48.934 --> 16:50.801
I worry about her.

16:52.904 --> 16:57.975
They're both fine.

17:03.582 --> 17:06.349
He's like you.

17:06.417 --> 17:09.287
And her?

17:09.354 --> 17:12.089
She's delicate somehow.

17:46.126 --> 17:48.127
Oh, Viola, dear, there you are.

17:48.195 --> 17:50.196
Have you seen
Caspar's datebook?

17:50.264 --> 17:52.165
It's in the dining room.

17:52.233 --> 17:53.867
Oh, for God sakes.

17:53.935 --> 17:58.705
That man... God help us
if we ever go to war.

17:58.773 --> 18:02.742
You look tired. Are you okay?

18:02.810 --> 18:05.412
I haven't been
sleeping very well.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.713
Grayson.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.648
I'm worried about Grayson,
and...

18:08.716 --> 18:10.150
Is he doing all right?

18:10.217 --> 18:12.319
Yes. Likes biology.

18:12.386 --> 18:14.287
Never would have guessed that.

18:14.355 --> 18:16.056
And to think
we almost lost him.

18:16.124 --> 18:17.824
Well, it all worked out.

18:17.892 --> 18:21.228
Thanks to you
and Mr. Weinberger.

18:21.296 --> 18:22.997
Oh. Anyway, it's all right now.

18:23.064 --> 18:24.331
Yes.

18:34.275 --> 18:36.143
Oh, hello, miss Radensky.

18:36.210 --> 18:37.644
Hi.

18:37.712 --> 18:40.547
How was the conference today?
Long.

18:40.615 --> 18:41.982
Waiting for Philip.

18:42.050 --> 18:43.283
Yes.

18:46.554 --> 18:48.789
Can you finish with miss Radensky up front?
I got to go.

18:48.856 --> 18:50.390
Grayson looked bad today.

18:50.458 --> 18:51.725
When Viola got back from work
and she saw him,

18:51.793 --> 18:53.127
she almost lost it.

18:53.194 --> 18:55.329
I think we got to minimize
our trips.

18:55.396 --> 18:57.564
I should have
taken that clock myself.

18:57.632 --> 19:00.200
No. Absolutely not.
You have to be half her ally.

19:00.268 --> 19:02.869
Still, we've got to cover
these meets as best we can.

19:02.937 --> 19:04.671
I don't think you should
go alone.

19:04.739 --> 19:07.207
We're sitting ducks either way.

19:07.275 --> 19:09.009
She says something, that's it.

19:15.083 --> 19:17.018
Come here.

19:17.086 --> 19:18.953
Every...

19:22.825 --> 19:25.394
I'm not getting arrested.

19:25.462 --> 19:26.729
Oh, God.

19:26.796 --> 19:28.764
So, what if there's 10 of them?

19:28.832 --> 19:32.135
What they'd do to us...
Tortured, locked away,

19:32.202 --> 19:33.603
told to betray
everything we believe in

19:33.671 --> 19:36.239
if we ever want to
see our kids again.

19:36.307 --> 19:38.741
I'm not gonna
make that choice, Philip.

19:40.878 --> 19:43.713
One day, you could
maybe find a way

19:43.781 --> 19:46.649
to make them understand.

19:50.821 --> 19:52.021
So, go.

19:52.089 --> 19:55.424
If they are there, if it's me,

19:55.492 --> 19:58.394
they'll be at the house
in an hour.

20:39.734 --> 20:41.602
Did you have any problems?

20:41.670 --> 20:43.971
Uh... no.

20:46.408 --> 20:49.110
So, tell me how you did it.

20:49.177 --> 20:52.780
I was in the study dusting,
and I just took it.

20:52.847 --> 20:54.214
You unplugged it?

20:54.282 --> 20:57.684
I unplugged it,
a-and I put it in my purse.

20:57.752 --> 20:59.453
You took your purse
into the study?

20:59.520 --> 21:00.787
Nobody found that odd?

21:00.855 --> 21:03.123
Well, people don't
look at me that way.

21:03.191 --> 21:05.258
I can do what I want.

21:07.061 --> 21:10.163
Give it to me.

21:10.231 --> 21:12.299
Please, don't shoot me.
Give it to me!

21:12.366 --> 21:13.700
I... I have it with me.

21:13.768 --> 21:16.070
Give it to me!
If you shoot me...

21:16.137 --> 21:18.205
Don't you come any closer....I
won't be able to adminis...

21:18.273 --> 21:20.307
Albert!

21:32.520 --> 21:33.854
Albert, no!

21:40.495 --> 21:42.262
Stop it! Albert, no! No!

21:44.699 --> 21:45.699
Please, stop it!

21:49.104 --> 21:51.071
Albert, no! I'm gonna kill you!

21:51.139 --> 21:53.474
Stop it!

21:53.541 --> 21:55.476
Stop it! Stop it!

21:55.543 --> 21:58.111
Stop it!

21:58.179 --> 22:00.847
Stop! He's gonna kill you!

22:03.184 --> 22:04.852
No!

22:06.020 --> 22:07.654
Ohh!

22:07.722 --> 22:10.057
Aah! Who is that?!

22:10.124 --> 22:12.059
It's my brother.
It's... it's Grayson's Uncle.

22:12.126 --> 22:14.895
Please, I told him not to come.

22:14.962 --> 22:17.798
He... he promised.
He swore to me!

22:17.865 --> 22:21.301
My boy, he's my life.
He's my life.

22:21.369 --> 22:25.505
I did everything
you asked me to do.

22:25.573 --> 22:28.742
I told you not to say
anything to anybody.

22:28.810 --> 22:31.612
He's my family.
I-I didn't know what to do.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.713
I-I didn't know!

22:32.781 --> 22:34.949
Did you tell anyone else? No.

22:35.016 --> 22:37.851
You don't understand, do you?

22:37.919 --> 22:39.786
No one knows about this.

22:39.854 --> 22:41.555
Not now, not a year from now,

22:41.622 --> 22:43.790
not even when you're on your
deathbed telling your grandkids,

22:43.858 --> 22:45.258
or <i>they</i> pay the price.

22:45.326 --> 22:48.128
Because we can get to you
anytime... anytime.

22:48.196 --> 22:51.231
Your whole family.
You see that's true, don't you?

22:51.299 --> 22:53.901
Get me the clock now.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.129
Honey.

23:23.196 --> 23:24.630
I was thinking this weekend

23:24.697 --> 23:26.666
maybe we'd go
to the mall together.

23:26.733 --> 23:29.201
You want to take me
bra shopping?

23:29.269 --> 23:32.037
Yeah, I thought
that would be nice.

23:32.105 --> 23:37.843
Mom, it's like... kids don't
really buy bras with their moms.

23:37.910 --> 23:40.012
Sure, they do.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.414
Not really.

23:47.019 --> 23:48.587
Paige...

23:48.654 --> 23:50.322
What?

23:53.326 --> 23:56.428
Just in a few years, um...

23:58.498 --> 24:00.499
Paige, look at me.

24:06.540 --> 24:08.841
I love you.

24:08.909 --> 24:11.844
I love you, too, mom.

24:28.297 --> 24:30.031
Hey.

24:30.099 --> 24:32.934
Henry's ready for be...

24:33.002 --> 24:35.604
It's fine. What happened?

24:35.672 --> 24:38.173
She told her brother.

24:38.241 --> 24:41.076
Jesus. A fighter.

24:41.144 --> 24:43.278
What did you do to him?
About the same.

24:43.346 --> 24:45.047
Philip, do you think we're...

24:45.115 --> 24:48.918
I think
this is turning to shit.

24:48.986 --> 24:51.454
But we'll know more tomorrow.

25:03.969 --> 25:09.239
Coming to you live from the home
of the Secretary of defense.

25:11.209 --> 25:13.777
Still joking.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.912
That's a good sign.

25:18.149 --> 25:19.815
Okay, teeth.

25:19.883 --> 25:21.250
I did before you came in.

25:21.318 --> 25:23.352
Uh-huh.

25:23.420 --> 25:24.687
Dad, I swear!

25:24.754 --> 25:26.154
Henry, if I go
into that bathroom

25:26.222 --> 25:27.722
and your toothbrush is dry...

25:27.790 --> 25:29.991
You're gonna what?

25:37.933 --> 25:39.267
Hello?

25:39.335 --> 25:41.069
Hello?

26:03.726 --> 26:05.794
Oh, he snuck it!

26:05.862 --> 26:08.664
Hmm.

26:13.403 --> 26:14.937
Come on. Come out. Cut me off.

26:15.004 --> 26:17.106
Cut me off. Ohh!

26:20.444 --> 26:22.945
Same again.
Hey, what's the score?

26:23.013 --> 26:26.414
Oh, uh, well, I'm killing him,

26:26.482 --> 26:28.016
but, uh, I don't let him
take shots, so that helps.

26:28.084 --> 26:29.651
All right, time for bed, bud.

26:29.719 --> 26:31.819
Aw, come on!
Just one more shot, please?

26:31.887 --> 26:34.656
One more. Here it comes.
Get ready.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.391
Ooh! Aw!

26:36.459 --> 26:38.026
I'm sorry, Henry.
I didn't mean to kill the game.

26:38.094 --> 26:39.261
It's okay, Mr. Beeman.

26:39.328 --> 26:42.197
Goodnight, dad. Goodnight.

26:42.265 --> 26:43.632
Do you play at all?

26:43.700 --> 26:45.534
Hockey? No.

26:45.602 --> 26:47.336
I used to play
football and baseball,

26:47.404 --> 26:49.338
but now it's pretty much
just racquetball

26:49.406 --> 26:51.941
if I can find the time.
We should have a game.

26:52.008 --> 26:53.742
Oh, you play? Yeah, yeah.

26:53.810 --> 26:56.878
There's, uh... there's a club
on Golden Meadow Lane.

26:56.946 --> 26:58.513
Golden Meadow Lane? What?

26:58.581 --> 27:01.550
No, it's just we lived in
the city in St. Louis, you know?

27:01.618 --> 27:04.419
It was 1st street, 2nd street,
Washington, Lincoln.

27:04.487 --> 27:07.389
Oh, yeah, it's, uh...
No, it's a good life out here.

27:07.457 --> 27:10.225
Yeah, seems like it.
Low stress.

27:10.292 --> 27:11.693
Most of the time.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.695
You raise your kids,
you go to work.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.330
As long as you take care
of your responsibilities,

27:15.398 --> 27:17.165
everything's okay.

27:17.233 --> 27:19.134
Seems pretty ideal.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.737
Yeah, no, it really is.

27:21.805 --> 27:24.574
Yeah. Hey, Philip.

27:24.641 --> 27:28.712
You ever had, uh...
You ever had caviar?

27:28.779 --> 27:31.114
Yeah. Yeah, I, um...

27:31.182 --> 27:34.084
I tried it once
at a tourism convention.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.586
I didn't like it much.

27:36.654 --> 27:38.622
Well, this stuff is
apparently the best.

27:38.690 --> 27:43.260
It's Beluga.
It's like $500 an ounce.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.895
Wow. Where'd you get it?

27:44.963 --> 27:47.464
I was working on this case,
and this asshole, this guy...

27:47.532 --> 27:49.666
You ever meet
one of those guys who...

27:49.734 --> 27:52.569
Uh, I shouldn't
talk about it, really.

27:52.637 --> 27:55.072
Anyway, I took his caviar.

27:58.509 --> 28:00.743
Oh, wow. Mmm.

28:00.811 --> 28:02.745
That's so salty. Mm.

28:02.813 --> 28:04.613
Well, that's
what the beer's for.

28:04.681 --> 28:07.016
Cheers.

28:07.083 --> 28:08.984
Mmm.

28:12.122 --> 28:14.557
Mmm.

28:25.415 --> 28:27.316
So, this morning,
you put it back.

28:27.383 --> 28:28.984
You make sure you plug it in.

28:29.052 --> 28:32.721
You do that, and he gets better
before you know it.

28:34.892 --> 28:37.561
Don't you worry about God?

28:39.197 --> 28:40.964
No.

28:41.032 --> 28:42.165
I worry about you.

28:42.233 --> 28:45.402
I worry about your son.

28:45.470 --> 28:47.604
We're this close now,

28:47.672 --> 28:51.174
and everything
goes back to normal.

28:59.952 --> 29:02.054
You think you can just walk
into my store again?

29:02.122 --> 29:04.456
I've got news for you.

29:04.524 --> 29:05.957
I don't have to cooperate with
a couple dumbass federal cops

29:06.025 --> 29:08.259
who think they can ju...

29:08.327 --> 29:09.661
What are you doing?

29:09.729 --> 29:12.064
I'm trying to resist
my true feelings.

29:12.131 --> 29:14.466
And I want to give you
one more chance.

29:14.533 --> 29:17.902
Okay, who was the woman
who came in here the other day?

29:17.970 --> 29:19.537
What did she buy?

29:19.605 --> 29:21.572
And what do you know about her?

29:21.639 --> 29:23.507
I'm gonna give you
one more chance

29:23.575 --> 29:25.509
to get the hell
out of my sto... aah!

29:25.577 --> 29:27.311
What are you doing?
You can't do this.

29:27.378 --> 29:29.914
I can't. You're right. But him?

29:30.882 --> 29:33.150
He's one of three minorities
we have at our headquarters.

29:33.218 --> 29:34.819
They... they can't fire him.

29:34.886 --> 29:36.454
I mean, he can
pretty much do anything.

29:38.757 --> 29:40.991
Now, I asked you
for your help before.

29:41.059 --> 29:43.127
I'm not trying
to put you in jail

29:43.194 --> 29:44.895
or ruin your life or anything.

29:44.963 --> 29:46.730
I just want a little cooperation, okay?
It's not so much to ask.

29:46.798 --> 29:49.166
So, let me ask you again, okay?

29:49.234 --> 29:51.836
Who is that woman
who came in here,

29:51.903 --> 29:53.571
and what did she want?

30:09.656 --> 30:12.225
Hello, Viola.

30:12.292 --> 30:14.026
Hi.

30:50.097 --> 30:51.231
Come on.

31:23.698 --> 31:26.400
She didn't do it.

31:26.467 --> 31:27.768
Shit!

31:27.835 --> 31:29.436
She made a decision,

31:29.504 --> 31:31.538
so we have to assume
she's reporting everything.

31:31.605 --> 31:33.573
We can't go back to the apartment,
and that kid's gonna die.

31:33.640 --> 31:34.874
They'll know it was the KGB.

31:34.942 --> 31:36.876
Yeah, that was
the risk they took.

31:36.944 --> 31:40.379
They didn't ask us.

31:40.447 --> 31:41.781
At least <i>we</i> weren't blown.

31:41.849 --> 31:43.983
Philip, wait. No.
We don't know what she's doing.

31:44.051 --> 31:45.785
She didn't
put the clock back...

31:45.853 --> 31:48.020
With her son's life at stake.

31:48.088 --> 31:51.424
She didn't do the one thing
that could have saved his life.

31:52.859 --> 31:54.159
We have to finish it.

31:54.227 --> 31:55.994
There's... there's
nothing to finish.

31:56.062 --> 31:57.396
This is our job.

31:57.463 --> 31:58.697
What is?

31:58.765 --> 32:00.999
Throwing our lives away
for nothing?

32:01.066 --> 32:02.800
Dupont Circle Travel.
Phil Jennings.

32:02.868 --> 32:04.735
This is your service,
Mr. Jennings.

32:04.803 --> 32:07.338
You have a message
from Celia Gerard.

32:07.406 --> 32:10.208
If you want to talk about
splitting advertising packages,

32:10.275 --> 32:12.143
she'll be in her office
tonight until 7:00.

32:12.211 --> 32:14.779
Thank you.

32:16.749 --> 32:18.616
Emergency signal from Annelise.

32:33.231 --> 32:35.198
We clear?

32:35.266 --> 32:36.899
I think so. Come on, Chris.

32:36.967 --> 32:38.634
This guy's clear. I'm waiting
for this guy to turn.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.805
Okay. Go.

32:42.873 --> 32:46.042
Blue. Blue.

32:52.116 --> 32:57.519
I'm agent Beeman with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

32:57.586 --> 33:01.022
I'll make this fast in case
your people are watching you.

33:01.089 --> 33:04.225
You're trading
extremely expensive caviar

33:04.293 --> 33:07.228
for high-end stereo systems
at a store on calvert street.

33:07.295 --> 33:10.664
The clerk's also putting
<i>U.S currency</i>

33:10.732 --> 33:12.300
<i>into the components for you.</i>

33:12.367 --> 33:13.701
Here's what I think.

33:13.769 --> 33:16.538
You're stealing the caviar
from your embassy.

33:16.606 --> 33:19.041
You've got access
to a diplomatic pouch,

33:19.108 --> 33:20.910
and you're using it to ship
the stereos and the currency

33:20.977 --> 33:22.845
back to your family at home.

33:22.913 --> 33:24.847
They're selling
the stereos in Russia

33:24.915 --> 33:27.616
for even more hard currency
and making out like bandits.

33:27.684 --> 33:29.718
How am I doing so far?

33:29.786 --> 33:31.920
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:31.987 --> 33:33.621
Well, maybe you're doing
this all for your bosses,

33:33.689 --> 33:35.523
in which case they won't mind
when I tell them about it.

33:37.826 --> 33:42.930
Or... and this is
kind of what I'm counting on...

33:42.997 --> 33:44.832
This is my lucky day.

33:44.900 --> 33:47.835
You're Violating
a shitload of Soviet laws,

33:47.903 --> 33:50.805
and you're looking at 10 years
in a Siberian labor camp.

33:50.873 --> 33:52.841
If that's the case,
just nod now,

33:52.908 --> 33:54.909
and I'll keep my mouth shut.

33:54.977 --> 33:56.844
But you're gonna have to
start working for me.

34:01.383 --> 34:04.119
Thanks.
Last chance before I go.

34:04.186 --> 34:06.187
Nod now.

34:32.646 --> 34:34.313
You used the emergency signal.

34:34.380 --> 34:36.114
What happened?
I'm tired of this!

34:36.183 --> 34:37.449
I'm gonna tell somebody.

34:37.516 --> 34:40.052
Annelise.
I don't care what you say.

34:40.119 --> 34:43.088
I'm stuck in a house
alone with him, and you're...

34:43.156 --> 34:46.092
You're out here doing
whatever it is that you do!

34:46.159 --> 34:47.726
And... what if I call
the police?

34:47.793 --> 34:49.161
Please, don't threaten me.

34:49.228 --> 34:52.063
It's not a threat
'cause I'll do it.

35:01.975 --> 35:04.109
You've...
You've been through a lot.

35:04.177 --> 35:07.980
And what you did for us
the other night, that was great.

35:08.047 --> 35:10.349
You were... you were fantastic.

35:10.416 --> 35:13.719
But I just need you
to take a breath.

35:15.755 --> 35:17.589
Hmm.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.591
You were ready to rescue me.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.494
What would you have done?

35:22.562 --> 35:25.665
I would have taken you
out of the country.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.501
To go live in Sweden? Yeah.

35:28.568 --> 35:30.670
I don't have family there
anymore.

35:30.737 --> 35:33.106
I would have been very lonely.

35:33.174 --> 35:35.942
Well, couldn't you get
reassigned there

35:36.010 --> 35:37.544
to your headquarters
or something?

35:37.612 --> 35:41.114
That's not what I do.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.951
Well, couldn't you do something
horribly masculine

35:44.018 --> 35:46.720
with reindeers
and wood-chopping?

35:46.788 --> 35:50.724
We could drink hot cocoa
and make love on a bearskin rug.

35:50.792 --> 35:52.793
Hmm?

35:54.929 --> 35:57.164
That sounds very tempting.

35:57.232 --> 35:59.100
Just say yes!

35:59.167 --> 36:02.236
Just for tonight.
Make me happy.

36:02.304 --> 36:06.140
I know it's not real.

36:10.045 --> 36:12.814
Yes.

36:12.881 --> 36:14.048
Mm.

36:16.918 --> 36:22.457
Oh. And we'll gaze out
the window at the snowflakes.

36:22.525 --> 36:24.893
And I'll never think
of Douglas again.

36:24.961 --> 36:30.499
My big, strong Scott
will hold me in his arms,

36:30.567 --> 36:31.934
and we'll make little babies.

36:32.002 --> 36:34.203
And it will be the beginning
of our life together

36:34.271 --> 36:36.573
starting tonight.

36:39.677 --> 36:42.512
Wait, what a...
Don't you need a ride?

36:42.580 --> 36:45.315
I'll see you later.

36:51.890 --> 36:54.358
Viola, listen to me.

36:54.426 --> 36:57.362
You still have one more chance
to save his life.

36:57.430 --> 37:00.332
I don't believe
anything you say.

37:00.399 --> 37:02.801
You see your son.
He is dying in front of you.

37:02.869 --> 37:05.104
You know that's the truth.

37:05.171 --> 37:06.071
He'll make it another 24 hours.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.609
If you didn't tell anyone,
and I don't think that you did,

37:10.677 --> 37:12.544
you can still put
that clock back tomorrow,

37:12.612 --> 37:15.747
and this will all end.

37:15.815 --> 37:18.250
I know the devil.

37:20.887 --> 37:24.423
Her final answer is no.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.435
All you have to do
is put the clock back.

37:35.503 --> 37:36.904
It is so simple.

37:36.971 --> 37:40.507
I don't have to listen to you.

37:40.575 --> 37:43.243
I listen to my lord.
He protects me.

37:43.310 --> 37:45.645
He guides me.

37:49.884 --> 37:53.419
There's been a misunderstanding
between you and your lord.

37:53.487 --> 37:55.355
What are you...
What are you doing?

37:55.423 --> 37:56.890
Stop it! Just stop it!
In his condition,

37:56.958 --> 37:58.391
Grayson will be dead
in 30 seconds, Viola.

37:58.459 --> 38:00.561
No! Listen to us
. There's still time.

38:00.628 --> 38:02.863
No, no, no, no, no, no!
25 seconds, Viola.

38:02.930 --> 38:04.464
What kind of people are you?!
Who are you?!

38:04.532 --> 38:05.933
20 seconds, Viola. Please, no!

38:06.000 --> 38:07.568
No. No. 15 seconds, Viola!

38:07.635 --> 38:09.970
No! No, no, no! I'll do it!
I'll do it!

38:10.038 --> 38:11.138
I don't believe you!

38:11.206 --> 38:12.506
I swear! I swear!
I swear, please!

38:12.574 --> 38:13.874
I don't believe you
either, Viola.

38:13.942 --> 38:15.175
I swear I will! I swear to God!

38:15.243 --> 38:16.443
I swear to Jesus!
I swear to God!

38:16.511 --> 38:17.678
Please, please, get off of him!

38:17.746 --> 38:22.316
No! My, baby, no!

38:22.384 --> 38:27.322
Tomorrow, or the poison
kills him anyway.

39:11.912 --> 39:13.079
Viola.

39:15.549 --> 39:17.149
Oh, there you are.

39:17.217 --> 39:19.218
Just dusting, Mrs. Weinberger.
Did you need something?

39:26.493 --> 39:28.161
Unexpected guests,

39:28.228 --> 39:30.163
<i>and they're gonna be</i>
<i>in that upstairs bedroom.</i>

39:30.231 --> 39:32.065
<i>I'm gonna need</i>
<i>all the drawers cleared out</i>

39:32.133 --> 39:33.300
before they get here.

39:33.367 --> 39:34.367
<i>Yes, ma'am. And maybe the...</i>

40:20.685 --> 40:24.054
Okay.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.572
I got you something.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.941
What?

40:51.016 --> 40:53.750
You ever tried it before?

40:57.555 --> 41:00.357
No. We couldn't afford this.

41:00.425 --> 41:04.495
We were like you... no money.

41:04.562 --> 41:06.630
What did this cost?

41:28.185 --> 41:29.518
All right?

41:29.586 --> 41:31.253
Mmm.

41:35.425 --> 41:39.062
Philip...

41:39.129 --> 41:40.830
When I went back there today...

41:42.833 --> 41:46.569
You know that feeling,
that tingle

41:46.637 --> 41:48.971
when you know
it's about to go bad?

41:50.907 --> 41:52.809
I had that.

41:54.878 --> 41:59.182
And... I saw Henry and Paige.

42:01.385 --> 42:02.886
And you.

42:08.593 --> 42:12.863
They shouldn't ask us
to do impossible things.

42:12.931 --> 42:15.299
No.

42:20.639 --> 42:22.373
But we did it.

42:24.710 --> 42:28.981
And tonight, we're in the house
of the Secretary of defense.

42:31.251 --> 42:36.555
They must be after
something very, very big.

42:36.623 --> 42:40.092
Something that changes things.

42:46.665 --> 42:49.500
The last time we had a source
inside the KGB rezidentura

42:49.568 --> 42:52.236
was four years ago, sir.

42:52.303 --> 42:54.405
That's right. Yes.

42:54.472 --> 42:56.674
Thank you, sir.

42:56.741 --> 42:59.910
He's right here.

43:03.215 --> 43:05.516
Beeman.

43:07.185 --> 43:08.752
Yes, sir.

43:08.820 --> 43:11.522
Thank you, sir.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.492
I understand.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.795
Yes, sir. It's an honor.
It's a team effort.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.801
We will, sir.

43:24.869 --> 43:26.436
We don't know
how to lose over here.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.641
Well, that was the President.

43:31.708 --> 43:33.542
Holy shit.

43:33.610 --> 43:35.477
You'll tell your grandkids
about this moment.

43:35.545 --> 43:36.678
I can't believe it.

43:36.746 --> 43:38.980
That wasn't the President.
Damn it.

43:39.048 --> 43:40.048
It was the Chief of staff,
but still.

43:40.115 --> 43:42.850
It is a big deal, guys.

43:42.918 --> 43:44.552
The A.G called
a few minutes ago, too.

43:44.620 --> 43:46.187
The director's on his way down.

43:46.255 --> 43:47.922
If we're gonna
stop these people,

43:47.990 --> 43:49.323
this is the way to do it.

43:49.391 --> 43:51.359
Good work today.

44:12.381 --> 44:15.116
Paige, wake up.

44:17.253 --> 44:21.056
Mom? What is it?

44:21.124 --> 44:24.026
You know how we said
you could Pierce your ears

44:24.094 --> 44:25.928
when you were 15?

44:25.996 --> 44:28.331
Do you want to do it now?

44:28.399 --> 44:30.466
What?

44:30.534 --> 44:32.135
I mean, you can go to the mall

44:32.202 --> 44:34.037
and you can do it
with your friends,

44:34.104 --> 44:36.372
or I could do it for you
right now.

44:36.440 --> 44:39.042
You know, my mom
actually pierced my ears

44:39.109 --> 44:41.444
when I was about your age.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.814
You do it.

44:46.283 --> 44:48.819
Okay.

45:10.308 --> 45:12.675
Tell me when it's numb.

45:16.180 --> 45:19.716
It's numb.

45:26.624 --> 45:28.391
You ready?

45:28.459 --> 45:31.561
Yep.

45:31.629 --> 45:34.064
Good.

46:26.247 --> 46:27.680
<i>The Prime Minister</i>
<i>was very impressed</i>

46:27.748 --> 46:29.817
by how far you've come.

46:30.285 --> 46:31.718
<i>The President and Miss Thatcher</i>

46:31.786 --> 46:33.286
<i>always see eye to eye.</i>

46:33.354 --> 46:36.256
<i>But it's useful when you and I</i>
<i>chat ourselves</i>

46:36.324 --> 46:38.226
<i>to make sure our bosses</i>
<i>fully understand each other.</i>

46:38.293 --> 46:41.229
<i>The Prime Minister</i>
<i>fully supports your efforts</i>

46:41.297 --> 46:43.064
to build a ballistic
<i>missile shield,</i>

46:43.132 --> 46:46.869
<i>provided it covers Europe,</i>
<i>as well as the United States.</i>

46:46.936 --> 46:49.705
Think what a different world
<i>we'll live in</i>

46:49.773 --> 46:51.307
<i>as soon as we don't</i>
<i>have to worry</i>

46:51.374 --> 46:52.842
<i>about their nuclear missiles.</i>

46:52.910 --> 46:54.177
<i>Amen to that.</i>
