Thanks, I got one already.
Hey, listen...

02:40.901 --> 02:42.735

together, my brother?'

02:42.802 --> 02:44.937

good time with me?'

02:46.840 --> 02:48.908
Hey, listen. Uh,

02:48.975 --> 02:50.510
So you gotta sober up, okay?

All good?

02:52.278 --> 02:54.146
Six passengers.

02:54.213 --> 02:55.949
You're a fucking genius, man.

02:56.015 --> 02:57.383
Tomorrow we sit down with him.

02:57.450 --> 02:58.818
Six passengers would get

02:58.884 --> 03:00.219
my uncle's attention.

03:00.287 --> 03:03.022
Alright. Hey, girls,

03:03.090 --> 03:05.025

Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
Was I talkin' too loud?

03:17.370 --> 03:19.506
You just tell him there's
no bad words in the house.

03:19.573 --> 03:21.241
You're so right, baby.

03:21.307 --> 03:23.743
You're so right. Heh.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.784
Hey, hey, you know
that camping trip

03:31.852 --> 03:33.152

talking about before?

03:33.219 --> 03:36.056

You wanna go wake up mommy?

03:41.262 --> 03:43.530

- Yeah, go wake her up.

03:43.597 --> 03:45.299
Mom, wake up!

It's happening.

03:54.941 --> 03:56.575
'You got 20 minutes.'

03:56.643 --> 03:58.277
Just keep the lights off.

04:05.752 --> 04:06.820
- 'Yeah.'
- Boss.

04:06.887 --> 04:08.187
Koslow is taking us

04:08.254 --> 04:09.924
to The General in the a.m.
We're moving in.

04:09.990 --> 04:13.394
I sent you the ops plan
and we need verbal approval.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.730
Give me a sec, Wilcox.

04:23.737 --> 04:26.607
Koslow was your idea.

04:26.673 --> 04:28.241
'You're gonna get credit
for this.'

04:31.411 --> 04:32.713
'Conquer.'

04:32.778 --> 04:35.314

- Thank you, boss.

04:52.598 --> 04:55.334
Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

04:55.401 --> 04:57.170
This is Ryszard Klimek.

04:57.237 --> 04:59.840
His gang known as Vojtech
is one of the major

04:59.906 --> 05:01.641

among junkies'

05:03.444 --> 05:06.713
also known as Pink
or synthetic heroin.

05:06.779 --> 05:08.247
We're going after him.

05:08.314 --> 05:09.382
We have a source inside.

05:09.449 --> 05:11.485
His top drug runner,
who'll receive the drugs

05:11.552 --> 05:13.454
and take them to The General
at his factory

05:13.519 --> 05:16.456
providing all the evidence
we need to move in.

05:16.523 --> 05:19.059
Please make a visual note
of our source.

05:19.125 --> 05:21.327
And when we move in,
go easy on him.

05:21.394 --> 05:23.462
I'm gonna hand over
to the tactical team leader

05:23.529 --> 05:26.265
for the layout of the meat
factory and final brief back.

05:58.098 --> 05:59.533
Pete, I'm not gonna need
that key.

05:59.598 --> 06:01.168
Hey.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.937
You don't open the door
to anyone.

06:04.004 --> 06:05.306
And if I'm not back here
by 1:00...

06:05.372 --> 06:08.809
Pete, stop it,
I don't wanna hear this.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.444
1 p.m., baby. Okay?

06:10.511 --> 06:12.146
You gotta promise me.

06:13.279 --> 06:16.415
This time tomorrow,
we'll be on the road.

06:16.483 --> 06:18.352
All this will be over.

07:01.995 --> 07:03.997

are in there.

07:04.064 --> 07:06.533
Mother, Cousin Jackie,
and dad, it's me.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.103
If I need to communicate, I will
send you WhatsApp messages

07:09.168 --> 07:11.070
using one of these names.

07:11.137 --> 07:14.106
If I call you,
don't be surprised, just answer.

07:14.173 --> 07:15.875
Right before you meet
The General, they'll strip you

07:15.942 --> 07:19.312
of all electronics. This one
needs to enter the room.

07:21.648 --> 07:24.318
- No. The wire's in place.
- Today you need to wear mine.

07:24.384 --> 07:25.752
Hey, it's my ass
that's gonna get pat down.

07:25.819 --> 07:26.920
The wire's in place.

07:29.189 --> 07:30.757
Alright, let's test it.

07:30.824 --> 07:32.692
You wanna turn around please?

07:32.759 --> 07:34.395
Of course, sorry.

07:36.028 --> 07:37.898
Oh, and if you feel
your life is in danger

07:37.964 --> 07:40.334
ask to smoke a cigarette,
we'll come get you. Okay?

07:41.435 --> 07:43.370

07:43.435 --> 07:44.504
Yup. Done.

07:46.038 --> 07:48.509
Riley. Let's test it.

07:48.574 --> 07:49.908
Say something.

07:49.975 --> 07:51.110
Those Pollock's
won't give a fuck

07:51.177 --> 07:53.547
if I wanna smoke a cigarette.

07:53.613 --> 07:54.713
'Sounds great.'

07:54.781 --> 07:57.184
Alright, let's stamp it.

07:57.250 --> 08:01.353

09:26.306 --> 09:29.109
Okay, guys, we gotta go.
The parade is moving.

10:09.383 --> 10:10.650
Let's stop at liquor store.

10:10.716 --> 10:13.819
Uh, I wanna buy a bottle

10:13.886 --> 10:15.755
My God. This guy has no clue.

10:34.140 --> 10:36.041
Whitey Fisk, do you know him?

10:36.109 --> 10:39.079
- Yeah, we did time.
- Trust him?

10:39.145 --> 10:41.247
Yeah, he's a straight guy. Why?

10:41.313 --> 10:42.748
We have a buyer.
We're going to Techniska Bar.

10:42.816 --> 10:46.086
Wait, wait, wait.. What do
you mean, you got a buyer?

10:46.152 --> 10:47.955
How'd you find him?

10:48.020 --> 10:49.689
I checked. He's good.

10:53.559 --> 10:55.060
Fuck.

11:08.041 --> 11:09.442
I really want to see
my uncle face

11:09.509 --> 11:11.778
when we show up with cash.

11:11.845 --> 11:15.782
Jesus Christ. My cousin's one
annoying bitch.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.550
Hook me up.

11:17.616 --> 11:19.485
You don't want any of that..
Her face..

11:19.552 --> 11:21.120
It's a problem, believe me.

11:21.187 --> 11:22.221
He needs to stick to the plan.

11:22.288 --> 11:24.291
He'll fuck everything up.

11:24.357 --> 11:26.292
What, we follow
the Little Poland?

11:28.796 --> 11:30.997
Guys, there's been
a change of plans.

11:31.063 --> 11:32.966
Source was ordered
to take drugs to a buyer

11:33.032 --> 11:34.634

11:34.701 --> 11:36.235
'Okay,
if the exchange takes place'

11:36.302 --> 11:38.605
'arrest the buyer,
recover narcotics.'

11:38.671 --> 11:40.307
Copy that.

11:44.211 --> 11:45.812
We follow the Little Poland.

11:47.413 --> 11:50.015
'Guys, we follow,
you stay close by.'

11:50.082 --> 11:51.851

12:37.197 --> 12:39.666
You got a half Ki,

Six.

12:46.038 --> 12:47.540
Motherfucker, six Ki's?

12:47.606 --> 12:50.509
You got a bunch

of fentanyl?

12:55.182 --> 12:58.017
I fuckin' love it.
Y'all niggers crazy, man.

12:58.083 --> 13:01.253
I ain't got the cash for six,
but I'mma get that shit though.

13:01.321 --> 13:02.822
You're not good for six?

13:02.889 --> 13:04.725

Relax.

13:24.277 --> 13:26.479
I'm cool, Polack.

You look a little nervous.

13:30.350 --> 13:33.320
Are you the money guy? Hmm?

13:33.385 --> 13:35.488
You guys want
the fuckin' money or no?

13:35.554 --> 13:38.524
Three Ki's, it's 85k.

13:38.591 --> 13:40.426
Yeah, I can fuckin' count.

13:40.493 --> 13:42.629
You'll get that in two hours?

13:42.695 --> 13:44.564
I guess you motherfuckers don't

13:44.629 --> 13:46.966
- No. I don't know who you are.
- Ah.

13:47.033 --> 13:48.902
You did time at Bale Hill?

D section. Right?

14:02.716 --> 14:04.850
'Cause they don't got numbers,
they got letters up there.

14:04.918 --> 14:07.221
Who else you do time with?

14:08.422 --> 14:11.224
Well, fuck you guys. Fine.

14:11.291 --> 14:13.225
Fine, just give me half a Ki.

14:16.330 --> 14:18.465
Yeah, I want half a Ki now. Hmm.

14:20.767 --> 14:22.302
What the fuck is his problem,
man?

14:22.369 --> 14:23.570
His problem is

14:23.635 --> 14:25.004
Yeah, question is that, <i>cabron?</i>

14:25.071 --> 14:27.774
Who else you do time with?

14:34.380 --> 14:36.916
Delray he's murdered.

And Kantro, he's scratchin'
walls up in Austin County Mental

14:40.019 --> 14:43.255

two guys we can't check on.

14:43.322 --> 14:44.957
What the fuck

14:45.024 --> 14:47.225
I'mma ask you one more time.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.921
You don't even know me, man.

I'm no fucking cop.

15:23.929 --> 15:26.031
How can you say that, man?

15:26.099 --> 15:28.268
You're a cop.

15:28.335 --> 15:30.336
'Fuck you.'

15:30.403 --> 15:31.804
'If these guys
find out you're a cop'

15:31.871 --> 15:33.205
'you're a dead man.
You understand?'

15:33.273 --> 15:35.274
'Stop saying I'm a fuckin' cop.'

15:35.341 --> 15:36.675
'It's a serious accusation,
homie.'

15:36.743 --> 15:38.745
'You'll die here tonight.'

15:40.178 --> 15:41.346
Who are you, <i>cabron?</i>

15:41.413 --> 15:43.548
I'm a drug dealer,

15:43.615 --> 15:44.951

I said get the fuck outta here.

16:18.484 --> 16:20.954
Unh! It's no deal.
Fuck you. Fuck you.

16:21.020 --> 16:22.955
Waste my time again,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

16:23.022 --> 16:24.757
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

16:24.823 --> 16:27.993
Shut the fuck up! Alright?

16:28.059 --> 16:31.496
'Yo, freeze.
Put your fucking hands up.'

16:31.563 --> 16:33.698
Hands where I can see them.
NYPD.

16:33.765 --> 16:36.535
Chill the fuck out.
You too, motherfucker.

16:36.602 --> 16:38.069
I'm wired fuck.

16:38.136 --> 16:39.372
Huh?

16:43.909 --> 16:46.645
- What the fuck?
- 'Whoo-hoo-hoo.'

16:46.711 --> 16:48.148
Burrito on the floor.

16:49.883 --> 16:53.319
Don't.. Fuck, fuck. You don't
fucking kill cops in New York.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.389
Get some garbage bag.
Come on.

16:58.024 --> 16:59.357
'You need to clean this shit.'

17:08.267 --> 17:10.769
Gotta smoke a cigarette.

17:10.836 --> 17:13.105
Call off rescue. Let's make
this fucking car disappear.

17:13.173 --> 17:14.473
SO is two minutes away.

17:14.539 --> 17:16.174
'You're smoking now?'

17:16.241 --> 17:17.943
A cop just got killed.

17:18.009 --> 17:19.346
Call them off.

17:19.412 --> 17:21.180
Calling it off, guys.

17:44.903 --> 17:46.739
What the fuck
are you looking for, man?

17:52.278 --> 17:54.213
Come on. I need you inside.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.702
Get up. Hey.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.728
Okay.

20:42.015 --> 20:45.018
When did you understand
the buyer was a cop?

20:48.054 --> 20:50.723
Earlier in the conversation.

20:50.789 --> 20:52.957
Well, I thought
he was a rookie who..

20:53.025 --> 20:56.129
...got into more than
he can handle, I don't know.

20:56.194 --> 20:58.564
I felt he might take advantage
if I gave him an exit.

20:58.631 --> 21:01.968
You thought by kicking
and pushing him to the ground

21:02.035 --> 21:04.871
he would take advantage
of such polite exit?

21:04.936 --> 21:08.407
I-I was trying to avoid
bigger problems for Vojtech.

21:11.076 --> 21:15.013
An NYPD cop just got killed
in New York.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.349
Do you know
what that means, Piotr?

21:19.285 --> 21:20.720
'Bad business.'

21:20.787 --> 21:23.055
'They will shut down
all illegal activities'

21:23.122 --> 21:25.725
'until they find
their cop killer.'

21:26.992 --> 21:29.494
'Now, Stazek
doesn't have documents'

21:29.561 --> 21:31.963
because Stazek doesn't exist

21:32.030 --> 21:35.900
but you? NYPD will come for you.

21:35.968 --> 21:38.904
'The best drug runner
in Vojtech.'

21:41.441 --> 21:42.909
Oh, Piotr..

21:42.976 --> 21:46.512
This is bad business for me.

21:46.577 --> 21:47.881
I'm sorry, Mr. Klimek.

21:47.946 --> 21:49.981
Oh, no. Don't be sorry.

21:50.048 --> 21:52.818
That feeling
doesn't take us anywhere.

21:52.885 --> 21:54.921
We were talking
about business here.

21:54.988 --> 21:56.823
Please, sit down.

22:02.827 --> 22:04.297
Stazek tells me that

22:04.363 --> 22:09.068
the cop was pointing the gun
i-in your face. Correct?

22:10.869 --> 22:13.472
So, Stazek saved your life.

22:16.142 --> 22:18.911
You now owe the price
of your life to Vojtech.

22:18.978 --> 22:21.147
How much is your life worth?

22:24.450 --> 22:26.385
I don't know.

22:26.451 --> 22:28.554
Two words.

22:28.621 --> 22:30.123
Closed market.

22:31.423 --> 22:33.826
Bale Hill is a holding unit.

22:33.893 --> 22:37.462
It sends prisoners
all over the state.

22:37.528 --> 22:39.131
Hub.

22:39.198 --> 22:41.601
We control the product
inside the Hill.

22:41.666 --> 22:45.337
We control the supply
to prisons all over New York.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.044
You did four years
at Bale Hill, right?

22:53.945 --> 22:56.281
So if anyone
can get drugs inside

22:56.348 --> 22:58.317
that's, that's you?

23:02.020 --> 23:04.456
You, you want me
to control the supply inside..

23:04.523 --> 23:05.824
I mean, how would I do that?

23:05.892 --> 23:08.059
Oh, you're a resourceful man.

23:08.126 --> 23:09.729
With fentanyl, we can have

23:09.796 --> 23:13.865
tens of thousands hooked
on our product.

23:13.932 --> 23:16.134
They will work off their
debts to Vojtech.

23:16.201 --> 23:20.006
Not only in prison,
but afterwards on the street.

23:21.006 --> 23:24.644
I will own a fucking army.

23:41.527 --> 23:43.996
You'll break your parole.

23:44.063 --> 23:45.898
My lawyers will convince
the judge

23:45.964 --> 23:48.433
to send you back to Bale Hill.

23:48.500 --> 23:53.204
With good behavior, you'll
be released in five years max

23:53.271 --> 23:56.708
and our debt
will be extinguished.

24:02.647 --> 24:04.817
My life ain't worth that much.

24:06.751 --> 24:08.887
How much are the lives

24:08.954 --> 24:12.090
of your wife
and daughter worth to you?

24:15.528 --> 24:17.063
'We found them'

24:17.130 --> 24:19.365
'driving around your house.'

24:20.532 --> 24:22.000
So frightened.

24:22.067 --> 24:24.436
Suitcase filled with clothes.

24:30.409 --> 24:34.814
You informed them
what happened at Techniska.

24:34.881 --> 24:37.150
I-I just, I told them
to get out of the house.

24:37.215 --> 24:38.883
Where-where are they?

24:38.951 --> 24:40.553
'Outside.'

24:40.619 --> 24:42.254
'Waiting for you.'

24:43.923 --> 24:45.089
Oh, don't worry.

24:45.156 --> 24:48.793
Sofia and Anna will be okay..

24:48.861 --> 24:51.497
...while you're inside.

24:58.570 --> 24:59.538
Now..

25:01.440 --> 25:03.276
...fuck off.

26:22.954 --> 26:24.188
'You safe?'

26:24.256 --> 26:25.725
You guys left me
in the fuckin' lurch.

26:25.790 --> 26:28.259
You were supposed to take us
directly to The General.

26:28.326 --> 26:29.894
'I can't call those shots.'

26:29.961 --> 26:31.797
I'm only a soldier. I do
what I'm told. You understand?

26:31.864 --> 26:34.400
Only a soldier? You just
brought in six Ki's for them.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.168
It would've raised suspicion.

26:36.234 --> 26:37.836
They would've stripped me naked.

26:37.903 --> 26:39.570
'Look,
meet me tonight and hope we can'

26:39.637 --> 26:41.273
salvage something,
otherwise four years

26:41.339 --> 26:42.907
of hard work just
went down the fuckin' drain.

26:42.974 --> 26:44.876
What the fuck you talkin'
about..

26:44.943 --> 26:46.412
Are you fuck..

26:47.613 --> 26:49.382
'Anna,
do you wanna come and play?'

26:50.482 --> 26:51.850
Do you wanna go play with Nina?

26:51.916 --> 26:54.319
- Listen, sweetie...
- She's fine. Don't, now.

26:54.385 --> 26:56.154
'I can see you.'

26:59.424 --> 27:01.259
- 'Hi.'
- 'Hi, Nina, You wanna play?'

27:01.326 --> 27:02.528
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

27:02.595 --> 27:04.962
- Come on.
- Go the the backyard.

27:07.465 --> 27:08.699
Why didn't you do
what I fuckin' told you to?

27:08.767 --> 27:10.635
Just one sec.

27:10.702 --> 27:11.971
Why didn't you fuckin' leave?

27:12.038 --> 27:13.673
Pete, you've got blood
all over you.

27:13.739 --> 27:16.107
Answer my question.
Why didn't you protect Anna?

27:16.174 --> 27:17.875
I wanna know what's going on.

27:17.942 --> 27:19.345
Why didn't you protect Anna?

27:19.411 --> 27:20.880
- I'm sorry, I'm...
- I don't wanna hear sorry.

27:20.945 --> 27:22.314
I don't wanna hear
fuckin' sorry.

27:22.381 --> 27:24.650
You were supposed to take Anna
away from there, 1 p.m.

27:24.717 --> 27:26.218
You think these people
would have a fuckin' problem

27:26.285 --> 27:27.319
in killing the both of you?

27:27.385 --> 27:29.087
We tried.

27:30.056 --> 27:31.090
We fuckin' tried!

27:31.156 --> 27:32.591
We kept driving around the block

27:32.657 --> 27:34.159
hoping you'd be back.

27:34.226 --> 27:35.728
Fuck you!

27:55.146 --> 27:56.615
Come on.

28:52.971 --> 28:54.539
Yeah-hoo-hoo!

29:17.261 --> 29:20.566
Driver's license says
it's Carlos Harrera.

29:20.633 --> 29:23.001
His real name was Daniel Gomez.

29:23.067 --> 29:24.202
Who the fuck are you?

29:24.269 --> 29:26.337
Detective Edward Grens,
organized crime.

29:26.404 --> 29:30.241
- He was one of mine.
- 'What happened here?'

29:30.307 --> 29:31.743
He was supposed to be
a low-level buy

29:31.809 --> 29:32.778
off the street tip.

29:32.845 --> 29:35.279
They cut his throat,
pulled out his tongue.

29:35.346 --> 29:37.182
They knew he was a cop.

29:37.249 --> 29:39.152
'What'd you say his name was?'

30:46.184 --> 30:48.721
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:48.788 --> 30:51.256
Thanks for takin' me here.
It's so romantic of you.

30:51.323 --> 30:52.658
Yeah, dig in.

30:53.959 --> 30:56.161
Shut up and eat, girl.

30:56.228 --> 30:58.230
Homicide talk about anything?

30:58.297 --> 30:59.832
Like what?

30:59.897 --> 31:03.167
I think Daniel's connection
was Polish.

31:03.234 --> 31:04.836
Entire NYPD force
in this manhunt.

31:04.903 --> 31:07.272
You don't see to sharing
this little fuckin' detail?

31:07.338 --> 31:09.642
I gotta check my sources
before they get spooked

31:09.709 --> 31:11.509
by the stampede.

31:11.576 --> 31:14.078
You heard of Ryszard Klimek,
aka "The General."

31:14.145 --> 31:15.681
Hmm. Polish crime boss, right?

31:15.748 --> 31:17.850
Came over from Poland
after serving 20 years

31:17.916 --> 31:20.485
in some shithole
Eastern European dungeon.

31:20.553 --> 31:22.688
Now he's moving pieces
all over the board.

31:22.755 --> 31:25.323
You think he has something to do
with Daniel?

31:27.492 --> 31:29.928
Gomez was killed in this bar
in Little Poland.

31:29.996 --> 31:31.496
'It's impossible
to trace its owners'

31:31.563 --> 31:33.666
'the street's link it
to The General.'

31:33.731 --> 31:35.800
'Security cameras across
the street record Gomez'

31:35.867 --> 31:39.770
entering at 11:09,
then at 11:27 this guy pops up.

31:39.837 --> 31:43.674
Look at his body language. This
is a man who's just done bad.

31:43.741 --> 31:46.412
- What do you need?
- Your badge.

31:46.478 --> 31:47.947
IAS comin' after me.

31:48.012 --> 31:49.313
Christ, Eddie.

31:49.381 --> 31:51.717
I sent a man
when he wasn't ready.

31:52.785 --> 31:54.019
This is on me.

31:59.557 --> 32:00.893
Hold on a second. Watch my six.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.395
That girl over there
was Daniel's source.

32:07.432 --> 32:08.667
Shit.

32:11.737 --> 32:13.372
Shit. Help, help,
help, help, help!

32:13.439 --> 32:15.807
'I'll give anyone $20
who stops the <i>puto</i> behind me!'

32:15.875 --> 32:17.308
- Whoa!
- Help me out! Help me out!

32:18.374 --> 32:18.844
- 'Move! Nigga, move!'
- Hold on.

32:18.911 --> 32:20.446
NYPD! Get the fuck back!

32:20.511 --> 32:23.316
Tell me what happened to Daniel?
Tell me what happened to Daniel?

32:23.382 --> 32:25.551
- Daniel...
- I don't know nothin'! Okay?

32:25.616 --> 32:27.219
You got Gomez killed.

32:30.622 --> 32:32.057
Hey, Grens, you wanna talk to me
for a second?

32:32.124 --> 32:34.526
Hey, Ed. Hey, Eddie,
you wanna talk to me outside?

32:34.593 --> 32:36.461
Ed, outside, please?
Right now. Ed?

32:36.528 --> 32:38.431
You're gonna be down.

32:41.766 --> 32:44.236
What are you doing? You wanna
get these motherfuckers?

32:44.303 --> 32:45.370
Oh, this bitch better talk.

32:45.436 --> 32:47.805
You are scaring
the shit out of her.

32:47.873 --> 32:49.641
You wanna calm down,
you wanna be professional

32:49.708 --> 32:51.644
and let me do this, alright?

32:52.711 --> 32:54.980
- Do what you gotta do.
- You stay here.

32:59.917 --> 33:03.421
Hey, honey, you wanna
scooch over for a second please?

33:23.241 --> 33:25.377
Stazek carved him up like that?

33:27.145 --> 33:28.913
You think I'd fuckin' do that?

33:28.980 --> 33:31.316
I'm just trying to find
a professional way to say this.

33:31.383 --> 33:34.119
- Say what?
- You're fucked, Koslow.

33:34.184 --> 33:36.454
- Wait, who the fuck is he?
- 'He's my boss.'

33:36.521 --> 33:38.323
We tried to close the case
on The General

33:38.390 --> 33:39.591
and bury this whole mess.

33:39.657 --> 33:42.326
But Washington labelled
the case as weak

33:42.394 --> 33:44.162
and took the embassy
off the table.

33:44.229 --> 33:46.664
W-w-with all due respect, sir,
what the fuck you talkin'

33:46.730 --> 33:48.000
about taking the embassy
off the table?

33:48.066 --> 33:49.701
You just watched me
smuggle a dozen Ki's

33:49.768 --> 33:52.703
through Polish diplomatic
pouches.

33:52.770 --> 33:54.440
Deal was to give you enough
evidence so you could

33:54.506 --> 33:56.208
indict The General,
which I have fuckin'

33:56.275 --> 33:58.076
over-delivered at this point.

33:59.310 --> 34:01.446
'Look, I've done my part.'

34:03.115 --> 34:04.616
I-I want out.

34:04.682 --> 34:08.353
Agent Wilcox here has a plan
to keep your status alive.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.454
You should listen to her
and hope I like it

34:10.521 --> 34:15.226
'cause in my book,
you're old news, my friend.

34:15.293 --> 34:17.862
'Pete,
I think there's a way out of this.'

34:17.929 --> 34:20.164
We go along with
The General's plan.

34:20.231 --> 34:22.800
Evidence of fentanyl being
methodically distributed

34:22.867 --> 34:25.871
inside a state prison
buries Ryszard Klimek for good.

34:25.938 --> 34:29.974
And if that happens,
you're a free man.

34:35.380 --> 34:37.081
The fuck you talking about?

34:39.117 --> 34:40.753
Go back to prison?

34:43.188 --> 34:44.623
That was never part of the plan.

34:44.690 --> 34:46.358
And where is the part
of the plan where you become

34:46.425 --> 34:49.094
an accessory to the murder
of an undercover policeman?

34:49.161 --> 34:50.893
How am I an accessory
when I try to help him?

34:50.960 --> 34:53.264
I mean, it's all on the tape.
And you guys put me there.

34:53.331 --> 34:56.934
If I inform the NYPD
that I'm working with a witness

34:57.001 --> 35:00.204
to Officer Daniel Gomez's murder
you will be exposed.

35:00.271 --> 35:04.477
If you're exposed,
General's case falls apart.

35:06.978 --> 35:07.980
If I say no?

35:08.047 --> 35:09.882
Prosecutor will have
you serve the remaining

35:09.947 --> 35:11.849
twelve years of your sentence
and then tack on

35:11.916 --> 35:14.052
whatever the NYPD pins on you.

35:19.724 --> 35:22.126
Some fuckin' bullshit.

35:23.195 --> 35:24.730
I tried to help him.

35:24.797 --> 35:28.000
You're a convicted felon who was
present when one of their own

35:28.065 --> 35:29.701
was nearly beheaded.

35:30.969 --> 35:33.639
You should think
of your family, Pete.

35:35.106 --> 35:37.141
Look, once you're in charge
like The General wants

35:37.208 --> 35:39.277
you just build a list
of all the inmates

35:39.344 --> 35:41.046
and COs distributing for him.

35:41.112 --> 35:43.382
'Everyone's a potential nail
to crucify'

35:43.447 --> 35:45.250
'that son of a bitch.'

35:46.784 --> 35:48.686
I need to know you're in.

36:02.867 --> 36:04.536
And let me guess,
if I fuck up and bail

36:04.601 --> 36:06.271
then I'm alone, right?

36:07.572 --> 36:09.208
Don't fuck up.

36:56.721 --> 36:59.023
'Look, once you're
in charge, like The General wants'

36:59.090 --> 37:00.925
'you just build a list
of all the inmates'

37:00.992 --> 37:02.893
'and COs distributing for him.'

37:02.960 --> 37:06.631
'Everyone's a potential nail to
crucify that son of a bitch.'

37:09.400 --> 37:11.069
'I need to know you're in.'

37:13.672 --> 37:15.440
'And let me
guess, if I fuck up and bail'

37:15.507 --> 37:18.344
'then I'm alone, right?'

37:18.409 --> 37:19.944
'Don't fuck up.'

37:31.489 --> 37:34.393
'Yeah. Thank you.'

37:34.458 --> 37:37.694
'Alright. Thank you.'

37:37.762 --> 37:40.432
Yeah. Thank you.
Buh-bye. Buh-bye.

37:40.498 --> 37:43.034
Okay. Got a couple
hits on the names.

37:43.101 --> 37:45.570
First's a Pole,
street name's Stazek.

37:45.637 --> 37:47.939
Real name unknown,
whereabouts unknown.

37:48.005 --> 37:49.239
Unfortunately, that's it on him.

37:49.306 --> 37:50.942
He was probably
recently imported.

37:51.009 --> 37:52.677
Well, what about the American?

37:52.744 --> 37:54.046
This is where
it gets interesting.

37:54.112 --> 37:56.780
- Peter Koslow, he's a..
- What?

37:56.847 --> 38:00.184
"Complex. Born here,
parents immigrated from Poland.

38:00.251 --> 38:01.552
"Gulf War vet, sniper.

38:01.619 --> 38:03.288
"Served an additional
four tours in Iraq.

38:03.355 --> 38:06.057
"Medals, medical history,
post-traumatic stress disorder..

38:06.123 --> 38:07.625
"Crashed and burned
a few years ago.

38:07.693 --> 38:10.528
"Manslaughter, got 20 years for
killing a guy in a bar fight.

38:10.596 --> 38:13.030
- Then it's weird.
- Weird, how?

38:13.097 --> 38:15.534
Well, the file looks like
it's been redacted.

38:15.601 --> 38:17.169
"Paroled from Bale Hill
after four

38:17.235 --> 38:19.403
pending the full investigation
of new evidence."

38:19.471 --> 38:20.871
Doesn't add up though.

38:20.938 --> 38:23.408
Well, who could fuck with
his jacket like that.

38:24.576 --> 38:26.577
Feds is my guess.

38:26.644 --> 38:28.278
Can you dig into this Fed angle?

38:28.346 --> 38:30.081
You can't just fuckin'
poke around the Feds

38:30.148 --> 38:31.850
like they're one of your
junkie hookers, Grens.

38:31.916 --> 38:34.585
Look, I-I think this is the guy
who shot Daniel.

38:34.652 --> 38:36.287
You said Bale Hill, right?

38:36.353 --> 38:38.121
Bale Hill was part
of Daniel's cover story.

38:38.188 --> 38:40.357
He liked it because
his old man served time there

38:40.425 --> 38:42.861
but that was years ago,
if this guy was fresh out

38:42.927 --> 38:45.096
he could've tripped
the kid up on something.

38:46.931 --> 38:48.766
Let me see what I can do.

38:50.202 --> 38:54.039
Oh, shit. Got a breakfast date
with my sweetheart.

38:54.106 --> 38:56.808
Wait, this guy you're runnin'
to, is this somebody special?

38:56.873 --> 38:58.275
You jealous?

38:58.342 --> 39:00.578
I'm just hoping his name
ain't fucking Logan

39:00.644 --> 39:03.282
or-or Chad or Brett.

39:04.815 --> 39:08.119
Laila. Her name is Laila.

39:12.356 --> 39:13.925
Laila?

39:13.992 --> 39:15.560
Kat, why didn't you
tell me that?

39:17.027 --> 39:19.529
La.. Yo, I-I should come with
you and Laila!

39:19.597 --> 39:21.500
Y'all want a chaperone?

39:33.177 --> 39:35.246
- What are you doing here?
- We have to talk.

39:35.313 --> 39:36.681
Important stuff.

39:36.748 --> 39:38.015
Don't ever come knocking
on my fuckin' door.

39:38.083 --> 39:39.952
Go to the garage.

39:59.804 --> 40:01.807
All night awake, fuck!

40:01.873 --> 40:03.840
What happened?

40:03.907 --> 40:05.943
I had to do some sweeping.

40:06.010 --> 40:08.179
They guy you did time with.

40:08.246 --> 40:09.847
- Whitey?
- Yeah, Whitey.

40:09.914 --> 40:12.217
We found him 30 minutes ago.

40:13.985 --> 40:15.920
Why don't you fuckin'
listen to me?

40:15.987 --> 40:17.422
I told you, the cop
just used his name.

40:17.487 --> 40:18.556
He's a straight guy.

40:18.623 --> 40:21.025
You can complain to my uncle.

40:21.092 --> 40:22.660
He wants to see you.

40:22.726 --> 40:25.128
- Your wife good cook?
- Why?

40:25.195 --> 40:29.134
It's an old tradition to invite
boss home before prison.

40:30.534 --> 40:33.504
You sell two of this
to break your parole.

40:33.570 --> 40:34.972
Rest until Bale Hill.

40:35.039 --> 40:37.541
Yeah, I still gotta figure out
a way outta here.

40:37.608 --> 40:39.143
Figure it out fast, Piotr.

40:39.210 --> 40:41.746
Detective sniffing around
Little Poland.

40:41.813 --> 40:43.949
Monday you need to be inside.

40:45.684 --> 40:48.452
Kalash told me you went out
last night, motherfucker.

40:48.519 --> 40:49.521
Where did you go?

40:49.588 --> 40:50.955
It's none
of your fuckin' business.

40:51.021 --> 40:53.525
Come on, I want to know.
Where did you go?

40:55.126 --> 40:57.229
My wife's next door.

40:58.096 --> 40:59.798
You have <i>kurba?</i>

41:01.465 --> 41:03.534
She good fun?

41:03.601 --> 41:06.137
Huh? Who is she?

41:06.204 --> 41:09.508
Come on, tell me,
you mind if I bonk her a while

41:09.574 --> 41:12.010
when you're inside?

41:12.077 --> 41:13.912
You touch any of my things
when I'm inside

41:13.978 --> 41:16.614
and I'll carve
your fuckin' eyes out.

41:34.233 --> 41:35.834
When?

41:35.900 --> 41:38.269
Tomorrow? In a month?

41:38.336 --> 41:40.237
When?

41:40.304 --> 41:41.906
Two days.

41:45.376 --> 41:48.480
If you go back
inside, you'll never get out.

41:51.983 --> 41:53.952
You know that, do you?

42:05.362 --> 42:06.931
Are you happy
to spend the day with daddy?

42:06.998 --> 42:08.266
Uh-hmm.

42:09.067 --> 42:11.436
What are you doing?

42:11.503 --> 42:13.304
You see that down there?

42:13.371 --> 42:15.673
That's where I'll be going
on my business trip.

42:15.740 --> 42:17.275
But I don't want you to go.

42:17.342 --> 42:19.977
I know, sweetie, but what if I
told you this was the last time.

42:23.547 --> 42:25.082
Okay. Gotta go.

42:44.902 --> 42:47.538
<i>New warden's
name is James Leonard.</i>

42:47.606 --> 42:48.941
He's been briefed.

42:49.007 --> 42:51.142
You give him the list,
he'll put you in solitary

42:51.208 --> 42:53.310
and then in 24 hours
the appellate court judge will

42:53.378 --> 42:54.612
put you back on the streets.

42:54.679 --> 42:56.914
Daddy, you're too loud.
I can't hear my movie.

42:56.981 --> 42:58.682
Uh, I know.
I'm sorry, sweetie.

42:58.750 --> 43:01.552
Yeah, j-just watch your movie.

43:05.123 --> 43:07.425
Sofia and Anna will be
in a FBI safe house

43:07.492 --> 43:10.061
before Klimek evens knows
what happened.

43:10.128 --> 43:12.896
You have my absolute word
on that.

43:12.963 --> 43:16.434
Uh, look, um,
I'm gonna need three favors.

43:18.070 --> 43:21.739
First, I'll need a major drug
sweep day after I get there

43:21.806 --> 43:23.641
to dry up the competition.

43:23.708 --> 43:28.113
And second,
have, uh, Warden Leonard..

43:28.179 --> 43:31.548
...put me on program
post detail.

43:31.615 --> 43:35.554
And third, in six days..

43:35.619 --> 43:38.221
...courier these beautiful
yellow wonders

43:38.289 --> 43:39.557
to a Deputy Superintendent

43:39.623 --> 43:41.591
Reseda Johnson
compliments of the bureau

43:41.659 --> 43:43.260
so the prison receives
them on Founders' Day.

43:43.327 --> 43:45.163
And, there's got to be a
government seal on the package...

43:45.230 --> 43:48.266
I can't do this, Pete.

43:48.333 --> 43:50.401
You know, if the prosecutor
finds out that I helped

43:50.467 --> 43:53.771
people get high, he'll destroy
me, you, and the case.

43:53.838 --> 43:55.206
You..

43:56.340 --> 43:58.909
You gotta fuckin'
help me out here.

43:58.976 --> 44:00.612
I can't do it.

44:00.677 --> 44:03.581
It won't come through, if
it don't come from you guys.

44:18.496 --> 44:19.664
Hmm.

44:22.900 --> 44:25.469
Have Leonard assign me
to roof and yard maintenance.

44:25.536 --> 44:28.472
That I'll do,
the drug sweep I'll also do

44:28.539 --> 44:30.173
but the rest you're on your own.

44:34.811 --> 44:36.212
How's Sofia holdin' up?

44:36.280 --> 44:38.149
Just fuckin' great.

44:42.487 --> 44:44.856
- I'm sorry. I gotta take this.
- Yeah.

44:44.922 --> 44:46.791
One second, boss.

44:48.193 --> 44:49.828
I gotta go.

44:52.664 --> 44:54.466
You'll be fine.

45:26.998 --> 45:30.434
Pete, you should have told me
we have friends coming tonight.

45:30.501 --> 45:31.668
They brought me so many presents

45:31.735 --> 45:33.237
to keep me comfortable
when you're away.

45:33.304 --> 45:35.407
You have such an adorable
wife, Piotr.

45:35.472 --> 45:38.076
- Beata. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

45:38.143 --> 45:39.943
'We should get
this little creature in bed'

45:40.010 --> 45:44.382
then we can celebrate.
Let's go. I will help.

45:44.449 --> 45:47.184
- It's okay, I got it.
- No, no, no, no. Please.

45:47.251 --> 45:49.320
Piotr, I insist.

45:50.722 --> 45:52.290
'After you.'

46:07.771 --> 46:10.875
I don't have kids, Pete.
I regret it.

46:10.942 --> 46:12.744
Must be wonderful.

46:13.744 --> 46:15.212
It is.

46:16.213 --> 46:19.284
Beata wants them,
but I'm afraid..

46:19.349 --> 46:22.621
I would suffer too much
if something happened to them.

46:23.922 --> 46:26.625
Imagine someone hurts them.

46:29.092 --> 46:33.731
In the honor of bravery of
Pete's, his courageous wife

46:33.797 --> 46:38.535
here is a Polish song entitled
"I Used To Be A Rose"

46:38.603 --> 46:43.273
which talks about the love
we give to our partners.

46:43.340 --> 46:44.942
- <i>Na Zdrowie.</i>
- <i>Na Zdrowie.</i>

46:45.009 --> 46:46.510
<i>Na Zdrowie.</i>

47:34.125 --> 47:35.393
- Bye.
- Bye.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.362
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

47:43.467 --> 47:45.970
Yeah.
You need more reason to dig?

47:46.036 --> 47:48.972
The General just left
the Koslow residence.

47:49.039 --> 47:51.375
Honey,
you want to go to the zoo or not?

47:51.442 --> 47:53.244
Let's go to the zoo, come on.

47:53.311 --> 47:54.546
'We'll be back
in a couple of hours.'

47:54.612 --> 47:57.447
- Okay.
- Be a good girl, okay?

47:57.514 --> 47:58.815
You know daddy
loves you very much.

47:58.882 --> 48:01.651
I know. Can I go now?

48:01.719 --> 48:04.155
- 'Anna, come on!'
- Pete?

48:04.222 --> 48:06.290
Pete, come on.

48:06.356 --> 48:07.659
Give me a kiss, eh?

48:07.724 --> 48:09.527
- Mwah!
- See you later, guys.

48:09.592 --> 48:12.395
- Bye! Have fun.
- Bye! Love you!

48:12.463 --> 48:15.166
- Send me photos!
- 'Yeah, of course!'

48:37.954 --> 48:39.590
Those kids with a drone.

48:39.657 --> 48:40.990
Better call them today.

48:41.057 --> 48:44.028
Pete, don't worry.
I don't want you to worry.

48:44.094 --> 48:46.864
- I'll take care of it.
- You still got the key?

48:47.998 --> 48:49.733
It's right here.

48:52.103 --> 48:53.771
It's gonna be fine.

49:11.822 --> 49:14.159
'911, what's your emergency?'

49:14.224 --> 49:16.994
Please, I need help.
My husband's going crazy!

49:17.061 --> 49:19.396
He wants to kill me.
Please send someone fast!

49:19.463 --> 49:21.399
'Just hold it right now, ma'am.'

49:21.465 --> 49:23.535
'Ma'am, is he armed?'

49:23.601 --> 49:25.068
'Do you have any children
in the house?'

49:25.135 --> 49:27.371
Please send someone fast.

50:29.333 --> 50:30.934
Second time around, huh?

50:32.135 --> 50:34.438
I want you to stand
right there for me.

50:40.376 --> 50:42.813
Oh, what language is that?

50:42.880 --> 50:45.416
I don't know.
I was drunk when I did it.

50:45.483 --> 50:47.317
Maybe Chinese or something.

50:47.384 --> 50:49.487
You're not gonna tell me, huh?

50:50.922 --> 50:53.557
'Okay, now show me your arms.'

50:54.858 --> 50:57.193
- Are you affiliated?
- He is.

50:57.260 --> 51:00.697
Last term you become a courier
on behalf of the Poles.

51:00.764 --> 51:03.467
Look at you. They gave you
the white shirts, Slewitt.

51:03.534 --> 51:05.869
- His bed been assigned?
- Not yet.

51:05.936 --> 51:07.371
I got this.

51:07.438 --> 51:08.838
Welcome back, Koslow.

51:08.905 --> 51:11.576
Let them know he's here.
Follow me.

51:17.715 --> 51:19.717
Stand right there.

51:24.822 --> 51:26.458
Okay!

51:54.451 --> 51:57.554
Hey! Come here, boy! Yeah,
you see me talking to you!

51:57.621 --> 52:01.058
Don't walk away from me!
Hey! Hey! Pssh!

52:02.592 --> 52:03.793
- Mornin'.
- Mornin', boss.

52:03.860 --> 52:05.563
Mornin', gentlemen.

52:06.929 --> 52:09.799
One time, one time!

52:09.867 --> 52:12.769
Wake up, sleepyhead.
Hey, big man.

52:15.639 --> 52:17.175
Carlos.

52:19.177 --> 52:20.611
Hey, yo, fellas!

52:20.677 --> 52:22.614
Looks like we got us
a new white boy.

52:22.679 --> 52:25.115
- What up, Slewitt?
- Smiley, this is Koslow.

52:25.181 --> 52:28.117
Your new celley.
Try to make him feel at home.

52:31.855 --> 52:35.159
Hey, don't be scared.
They'll be gentle.

52:35.226 --> 52:36.861
Won't you, boys?

52:41.431 --> 52:44.334
The Prodigal Son returns.

52:44.400 --> 52:47.136
I need two extra mats.

52:47.204 --> 52:49.307
You and you, roll it up.

52:49.373 --> 52:52.009
It's your lucky day, dickheads..

53:01.184 --> 53:03.420
Each and every business that
takes places under the roof

53:03.487 --> 53:05.889
of this facility
runs through me.

53:06.856 --> 53:09.326
Comply or I crucify you.

53:11.195 --> 53:14.164
- Get back to your block.
- Yes, sir.

53:28.947 --> 53:31.182
'Rise and shine, ladies!'

53:41.992 --> 53:45.496
It's time to get the fuck off.

53:45.563 --> 53:47.231
Name?

53:47.297 --> 53:49.032
Koslow, Pete.

53:52.769 --> 53:54.938
Previous term
you kept yourself busy, huh?

53:55.005 --> 53:57.708
Roofing, HVAC maintenance?

53:57.775 --> 53:59.675
We should get you
on the program, Mr. Koslow.

53:59.742 --> 54:01.846
I appreciate that, warden.

54:03.047 --> 54:04.115
Name?

54:05.615 --> 54:07.550
That guy.

54:07.617 --> 54:10.853
- This guy.
- Hands up. Legs spread.

54:10.920 --> 54:12.755
- 'Next. Hey.'
- 'You.'

54:15.092 --> 54:16.794
'This dumb fuck.'

54:27.237 --> 54:30.740
They swept the whole place..
Bone-dry.

54:30.807 --> 54:32.541
That's a lucky break for us.

54:32.608 --> 54:34.378
Product will be here soon.

54:49.226 --> 54:51.028
Under the table.

55:28.032 --> 55:31.568
- Who?
- K-O-S-L-O-W.

55:31.635 --> 55:33.237
Comma Peter.

55:33.304 --> 55:35.905
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- Uh, don't apologize.

55:35.972 --> 55:37.808
Me, I'm old-school,
I knock on doors

55:37.875 --> 55:39.844
get-right-there-in-your-face
type of cop.

55:39.909 --> 55:42.278
Wilcox, we gotta go.

55:42.346 --> 55:43.780
Sorry. You are?

55:43.847 --> 55:47.016
Detective Edward Grens
from the NYPD.

55:47.083 --> 55:49.152
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

55:49.219 --> 55:50.687
We're just having a conversation

55:50.755 --> 55:53.858
about somebody named
Peter Koslow.

55:53.925 --> 55:55.492
'Decorated vet.'

55:55.559 --> 55:58.528
Driver slash security
for the Polish Consulate.

55:58.594 --> 56:01.831
Fast-tracked almost smells
like a bogus parole violation.

56:01.898 --> 56:03.367
Back into Bale Hill.

56:03.432 --> 56:05.534
Same prison he was serving
20 years for murder

56:05.601 --> 56:08.204
before somebody pulled him out
pending the investigation

56:08.271 --> 56:10.007
of new evidence.

56:10.074 --> 56:12.576
Anyway, I want to know
why your subordinate's name

56:12.643 --> 56:15.411
keeps popping up around
this admittedly suspicious

56:15.478 --> 56:17.380
motherfuckin' file.

56:18.981 --> 56:22.820
I'm sure that, uh,
Agent Wilcox's name pops up

56:22.887 --> 56:24.688
on a number of case files,
detective.

56:24.755 --> 56:26.023
You should check with the DEA.

56:26.090 --> 56:28.225
They just sent me here.

56:28.291 --> 56:31.394
'Look, if I was involved
in the kind of pro-active operation'

56:31.461 --> 56:34.030
that you are suggesting,
I would be intimately acquainted

56:34.097 --> 56:37.835
with, uh, Peter,
what was his name again?

56:38.402 --> 56:39.536
Koslow.

56:39.603 --> 56:42.106
- Koslow.
- Hmm.

56:42.172 --> 56:45.976
Our organizations may not
see eye-to-eye, detective

56:46.043 --> 56:50.448
but we've extended you every
professional courtesy we can.

57:00.490 --> 57:04.027
There's Koslow
right after Gomez was killed.

57:06.096 --> 57:08.931
That Prius screamin',
"We're the FBI!"

57:08.998 --> 57:11.634
'That's y'all leaving
the scene.'

57:11.702 --> 57:15.072
And here, even though this
picture may be hard to read

57:15.137 --> 57:19.442
that person looks very much
like you, Agent Wilcox..

57:19.510 --> 57:22.246
...drivin' away
from the crime scene.

57:24.248 --> 57:25.682
You want to pitch
your field office

57:25.748 --> 57:29.085
against the biggest police
department in the world?

57:29.853 --> 57:31.254
Let's do it.

57:31.989 --> 57:34.224
We love us a good fight.

57:38.429 --> 57:40.097
Have a good day.

58:32.048 --> 58:37.320
What perfume you wear?
Smells expensive.

58:55.237 --> 58:57.974
Alright. Now, get
this shit cleaned up.

59:36.579 --> 59:38.982
'Okay, that's enough.'

59:53.597 --> 59:55.833
'It must be tough on you.'

59:55.900 --> 01:00:00.170
- We'll get through it.
- 'Like you did the last time?'

01:00:00.237 --> 01:00:02.405
I checked the old visitor logs
at Bale Hill.

01:00:02.472 --> 01:00:05.409
You and Anna never missed
a visitors' day.

01:00:05.476 --> 01:00:07.945
That's how
you kept him strong, huh?

01:00:08.012 --> 01:00:10.047
You let him see
how much he had to lose.

01:00:10.114 --> 01:00:12.983
What do you want?

01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:16.086
Someone killed a friend of mine.

01:00:16.152 --> 01:00:18.053
I used to think
your husband did it

01:00:18.121 --> 01:00:19.389
but now I'm not so sure.

01:00:19.456 --> 01:00:21.992
This FBI thing has gotten me
thinkin' otherwise.

01:00:24.293 --> 01:00:27.129
Look, I'm here
to help your husband.

01:00:27.197 --> 01:00:30.166
But you got to give me
something to work with.

01:00:30.233 --> 01:00:32.335
You know, five years ago
we walked into a bar

01:00:32.402 --> 01:00:35.505
looking for a jump start
for our car.

01:00:35.572 --> 01:00:38.274
Some bikers inside started
making comments about me

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.277
so Pete asked them to stop

01:00:41.344 --> 01:00:43.481
and then he was fighting
three of them.

01:00:45.014 --> 01:00:46.382
That night

01:00:46.449 --> 01:00:49.118
I went from being the wife
of a great father

01:00:49.186 --> 01:00:53.090
and a loving husband
to the wife of a convict killer.

01:00:53.157 --> 01:00:56.494
And since then,
every time someone tells us

01:00:56.559 --> 01:00:58.161
they wanna help

01:00:58.228 --> 01:01:00.697
they end up doing
the exact opposite.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.369
So unless you wanna
buy something..

01:01:05.436 --> 01:01:09.139
With all due respect
to you and the NYPD

01:01:09.206 --> 01:01:11.642
get the fuck out of my store.

01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:17.581
I'm not like all the others,
Mrs. Koslow.

01:01:19.282 --> 01:01:22.119
I hope you don't learn that
the hard way.

01:01:28.324 --> 01:01:30.493
Stay safe out here.

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.742
And here we go.

01:02:47.605 --> 01:02:49.572
Let him through.

01:02:53.409 --> 01:02:57.079
'The Knicks
hardly get that exciting, huh?'

01:02:57.146 --> 01:02:58.614
Who's this?

01:02:58.681 --> 01:03:01.618
Motherfucker, I'm the hangman.

01:03:01.684 --> 01:03:04.355
And I just put a tight noose
around your neck.

01:03:05.688 --> 01:03:09.559
In a few hours, you're gonna be
alone on this yard

01:03:09.626 --> 01:03:13.396
it'll be the scariest moment
of your life.

01:03:13.463 --> 01:03:16.432
'Your only way out
is that man in front of you.'

01:03:16.498 --> 01:03:19.101
'His name is Vermin.'

01:03:19.168 --> 01:03:22.271
'When you're ready to talk
about Officer Gomez's murder'

01:03:22.338 --> 01:03:24.641
'tell Vermin
to call the hangman.'

01:04:15.358 --> 01:04:17.660
Here I am, dead man.

01:04:17.726 --> 01:04:19.829
Present and fucking
accounted for.

01:04:19.896 --> 01:04:22.032
We need to talk.

01:04:22.099 --> 01:04:23.567
I got a fuckin' present for you.

01:04:23.632 --> 01:04:25.768
Why're you selling fuckin'
product on my patch.

01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:28.706
To get your attention.

01:04:30.139 --> 01:04:33.542
You have it. I don't think
it's on you want.

01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:35.345
Slewitt.

01:04:35.411 --> 01:04:37.547
That's for not respecting
the system.

01:04:38.648 --> 01:04:41.085
That's for not following
our rules.

01:04:47.289 --> 01:04:49.492
Smiley, listen,
listen, listen.

01:04:49.559 --> 01:04:50.726
Please, listen!
You gotta listen to me.

01:04:50.793 --> 01:04:52.161
I'm here to take out
The General.

01:04:52.228 --> 01:04:53.663
I'm here
to take out The General.

01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:55.865
I need, I need his Bale Hill
distribution chain.

01:04:55.931 --> 01:04:57.667
I need all the names.
I need all the names.

01:04:57.735 --> 01:05:00.704
I'll take him down.
I'll fucking help you..

01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:06.309
Make it look like a suicide.

01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:08.178
Clean up after you're done.

01:05:19.155 --> 01:05:21.458
You think Mick is important?

01:05:21.525 --> 01:05:25.128
Six Ki's of fentanyl per week.

01:05:28.097 --> 01:05:30.034
What are those names for?

01:05:36.039 --> 01:05:37.975
What are those names for?

01:05:51.355 --> 01:05:53.923
I'm a... snitch.

01:05:54.858 --> 01:05:56.860
I'm a snitch.

01:06:03.199 --> 01:06:05.668
Let him down.

01:06:13.576 --> 01:06:15.378
It's their fault, Ben.

01:06:27.222 --> 01:06:29.291
Are you alright, dead man?

01:06:29.358 --> 01:06:31.061
You're a snitch?

01:06:32.695 --> 01:06:35.531
I made a deal with the Feds
to take down The General.

01:06:38.233 --> 01:06:40.871
Look, you're on top now.

01:06:40.938 --> 01:06:43.673
But The General's coming for you
harder than ever.

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:48.278
If you gimme that list

01:06:48.344 --> 01:06:50.646
I'll bury
that Polish cocksucker.

01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:55.552
That's all, huh?

01:07:03.592 --> 01:07:05.762
So, what's it gonna be?

01:07:09.432 --> 01:07:11.735
If you're alive in three hours..

01:07:13.735 --> 01:07:15.838
...you fuckin' own my ass.

01:07:41.998 --> 01:07:43.933
You can wait here.

01:07:59.581 --> 01:08:01.751
Grens went to Bale Hill.

01:08:01.818 --> 01:08:03.552
Shit.

01:08:03.619 --> 01:08:05.121
- I'm sure Leonard blocked him.
- He did.

01:08:05.188 --> 01:08:07.990
But it's only a matter of time
before he gets to Koslow.

01:08:08.056 --> 01:08:10.693
He's already got Washington
on the fucking phone

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.663
asking me why an NYPD cop
is trying to subpoena a file

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:16.198
on an FBI informant
who shouldn't exist.

01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:19.801
Look, we just need
to stall a few days.

01:08:19.868 --> 01:08:22.872
Koslow is so close to delivering
and then it won't matter.

01:08:25.207 --> 01:08:27.542
What? What are you thinking?

01:08:28.578 --> 01:08:31.180
- Burn him.
- No.

01:08:31.247 --> 01:08:33.782
He has a family, I mean,
we, you can't make this call.

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:35.752
The Bureau can't afford
the luxury

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:38.254
of your precious feelings
right now.

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:40.756
We looked him in the eyes.
We made him guarantees.

01:08:40.823 --> 01:08:43.091
You took a convicted killer
out of prison

01:08:43.158 --> 01:08:45.060
you run him off the books
and you stuck him in a room

01:08:45.127 --> 01:08:46.362
where a cop was murdered.

01:08:46.429 --> 01:08:47.564
If you don't see how this is

01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:49.131
about to blow the fuck up

01:08:49.198 --> 01:08:50.933
and tear you apart with it..

01:08:51.001 --> 01:08:53.470
...you're not the agent
I thought you were.

01:08:53.536 --> 01:08:56.238
How fucking dare you?

01:08:56.305 --> 01:08:58.674
I was operating
under your authority.

01:08:58.742 --> 01:09:00.644
You will not throw me
under the fucking bus

01:09:00.711 --> 01:09:02.011
if I don't burn an innocent man.

01:09:02.078 --> 01:09:05.015
I don't have to throw you
under the bus.

01:09:05.082 --> 01:09:08.018
I didn't know anything
about this operation.

01:09:10.484 --> 01:09:12.255
You were trying
to impress a superior

01:09:12.322 --> 01:09:13.957
and you went too far.

01:09:15.457 --> 01:09:17.094
We'll make an example of you.

01:09:18.895 --> 01:09:21.965
You will serve jail-time.
I guarantee it.

01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:34.810
You know, I started
on this floor 23 years ago.

01:09:34.877 --> 01:09:37.179
My desk was right there.

01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:42.286
Burn him.

01:09:43.353 --> 01:09:45.154
It's an order.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.962
I had you, white boy.

01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:31.667
Smiley Phelps
was right behind you.

01:10:31.734 --> 01:10:34.071
Like a nigger angel.

01:10:41.143 --> 01:10:42.244
Mmm.

01:11:23.787 --> 01:11:25.889
Hey, warden?
I just wanna shake your hand.

01:11:25.956 --> 01:11:27.222
Come on, leave the warden alone.

01:11:27.289 --> 01:11:28.692
Oh, no, it's okay.

01:11:30.092 --> 01:11:31.927
I just wanna thank you
and congratulate you

01:11:31.994 --> 01:11:34.329
for running this place
the right way.

01:11:34.396 --> 01:11:36.033
I now request a solitary.

01:11:37.833 --> 01:11:39.670
I can't do that, Pete.

01:11:41.203 --> 01:11:43.005
If you leave me out here,
I'm a fuckin' dead man.

01:11:43.073 --> 01:11:45.742
I'm sorry, Pete,
they were very clear.

01:11:45.809 --> 01:11:47.711
Who was clear?
Look, this wasn't the deal.

01:11:47.777 --> 01:11:49.311
Just get Wilcox here right now.

01:11:49.378 --> 01:11:50.913
Escort the inmate back
to his block.

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.817
- Yes, sir.
- Lenon, Lenon? Come back here.

01:11:55.851 --> 01:11:57.688
'Come on.'

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:07.963
Time is up!

01:12:09.431 --> 01:12:11.268
Come on, guys.
Get off the phones.

01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:14.804
Next in line. Six minutes.

01:12:24.847 --> 01:12:27.317
- Wilcox.
- It's me.

01:12:29.752 --> 01:12:32.021
Hey, it's me.

01:12:32.087 --> 01:12:35.157
I did it.
I drew you the picture.

01:12:36.493 --> 01:12:38.495
'Why aren't
you sayin' anything?'

01:12:40.796 --> 01:12:42.831
I did what you told me,
and I drew the picture

01:12:42.899 --> 01:12:44.735
and now I need
to show it to you.

01:12:46.036 --> 01:12:48.171
'I need to show it
to you right now.'

01:12:53.208 --> 01:12:56.345
You promised you'd come see it.
You fuckin' promised.

01:12:57.747 --> 01:12:59.382
'Fuck, you did!'

01:13:00.449 --> 01:13:01.417
'Hello?'

01:13:04.354 --> 01:13:06.289
Hello? Hello?

01:13:23.606 --> 01:13:25.908
Eh, eh, how much time I got?

01:13:25.975 --> 01:13:27.810
Two minutes and 15 seconds.

01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:53.470
- Hello?
- 'It's me.'

01:13:53.537 --> 01:13:54.838
Pete?

01:13:56.338 --> 01:13:57.974
Are you okay?

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:03.512
The key, you gotta use it
right now.

01:14:07.149 --> 01:14:08.150
Why?

01:14:09.819 --> 01:14:11.822
They fucked me.

01:14:13.655 --> 01:14:16.591
- I'm not gettin' out of this.
- 'No, no. You shut up.'

01:14:16.658 --> 01:14:18.027
'You listen to me.'

01:14:18.094 --> 01:14:21.230
There is a detective.
He, he asked about the dead cop.

01:14:21.296 --> 01:14:24.067
He knows about the FBI, okay?

01:14:24.134 --> 01:14:27.302
'You don't fucking give up now.'

01:14:27.369 --> 01:14:30.172
Okay. Alright.
Give him the tapes.

01:14:30.239 --> 01:14:32.274
Tell him there's information
about Daniel Gomez.

01:14:32.341 --> 01:14:33.710
He'll know what to do,
but you gotta

01:14:33.775 --> 01:14:36.445
you gotta make him promise
to protect you too.

01:14:36.512 --> 01:14:38.314
'You gotta do it right now.
You and Anna you ain't safe.'

01:14:38.381 --> 01:14:40.149
'You gotta get outta
the house right now.'

01:14:40.216 --> 01:14:42.018
'Okay, baby. You gotta get
out of the house right now.'

01:14:42.083 --> 01:14:44.887
Promise me.
Promise me right now, okay?

01:14:44.953 --> 01:14:46.288
- Now.
- 'I promise you.'

01:14:46.354 --> 01:14:48.157
'Time is up!'

01:14:48.225 --> 01:14:49.226
Pete.

01:15:19.055 --> 01:15:20.588
I have some information
that might

01:15:20.655 --> 01:15:22.292
interest your biggest client.

01:16:17.046 --> 01:16:19.182
Move away from that box.

01:16:25.654 --> 01:16:27.289
Sit on the chair.

01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:47.542
How'd you find me?

01:16:47.609 --> 01:16:50.612
Your phone. We heard everything.
We tracked you here.

01:16:58.421 --> 01:17:02.258
Now, you and Anna
need to get off the grid.

01:17:02.323 --> 01:17:04.626
You need to go somewhere
the Pols won't find you.

01:17:06.729 --> 01:17:08.396
Take those tapes

01:17:08.463 --> 01:17:10.600
and get the fuck
out of our lives.

01:17:19.641 --> 01:17:22.177
<i>What the
fuck you talkin' about?</i>

01:17:22.243 --> 01:17:24.480
<i>Go back to prison?</i>

01:17:24.546 --> 01:17:25.780
<i>That was never part
of the plan.</i>

01:17:27.682 --> 01:17:29.585
'How am I an
accessory when I try to help him?'

01:17:29.652 --> 01:17:31.721
'It's all on the tape
and you guys put me there.'

01:17:31.787 --> 01:17:34.623
'If I inform
the NYPD that we're working'

01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:37.460
'with a witness to
Officer Daniel Gomez's murder'

01:17:37.525 --> 01:17:39.496
'you'll..'

01:17:39.561 --> 01:17:41.197
'I was always close by, Pete.'

01:17:41.264 --> 01:17:43.565
'I was never gonna let
anything happen to you.'

01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:50.105
'How's Sofia holding up?'

01:17:51.439 --> 01:17:54.275
'You just scared my daughter.'

01:17:54.342 --> 01:17:57.046
'Stop trustin' me..'

01:17:57.113 --> 01:17:59.414
'Sofia and Anna
will be in a FBI safe house'

01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:02.018
'before Klimek even knows
what happened.'

01:18:02.085 --> 01:18:04.220
'You have my absolute word
on that.'

01:19:44.252 --> 01:19:45.988
Your time is closer.

01:22:16.037 --> 01:22:18.340
Get the fuck back.
Stay the fuck back.

01:22:18.408 --> 01:22:19.742
Stay back.

01:22:21.277 --> 01:22:23.945
- Back the fuck off.
- Everybody, on your knees!

01:22:24.012 --> 01:22:25.715
Face the wall!
Hands on the wall!

01:22:25.782 --> 01:22:27.449
- Back the fuck up.
- On your knees!

01:22:27.515 --> 01:22:28.951
- Face the wall. Hands on wall.
- 'Stay right there.'

01:22:29.016 --> 01:22:30.720
I'm gonna run this
in his fucking brain.

01:22:30.786 --> 01:22:32.755
Back the fuck up! Just take me
to talk to your boss.

01:22:32.822 --> 01:22:34.856
Koslow, tell him.
Don't do anything stupid now.

01:22:34.923 --> 01:22:35.925
Get the fuck back.

01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:37.760
Back off!

01:22:37.827 --> 01:22:40.929
I will kill him right now.
Back the fuck off.

01:22:40.996 --> 01:22:42.530
Back the fuck off.

01:22:42.597 --> 01:22:44.399
Do what he fucking says!

01:22:44.466 --> 01:22:45.835
Just stay away from him.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.635
Stay down there.
Stay down there.

01:22:47.703 --> 01:22:49.137
Get the fuck away.
Get the fuck over there.

01:22:49.203 --> 01:22:50.771
It's okay. We're here..

01:22:50.838 --> 01:22:52.908
I'll drive this into his fucking
brain. You hear what I'm saying?

01:22:52.975 --> 01:22:54.910
- Get the fuck over there.
- Ah!

01:22:54.976 --> 01:22:56.577
I will fucking kill him
right here.

01:22:56.645 --> 01:22:58.447
'Back the fuck up.'

01:22:58.514 --> 01:22:59.882
It's alright.

01:23:01.884 --> 01:23:03.685
You tell Lenon,
I wanna talk to the press.

01:23:03.752 --> 01:23:05.219
I want a phone to call my wife.

01:23:05.287 --> 01:23:06.322
He's got 15 minutes to comply

01:23:06.389 --> 01:23:07.588
or I'm gonna fucking
kill this guy.

01:23:07.655 --> 01:23:09.992
- Take it easy.
- Gimme the keys.

01:23:10.059 --> 01:23:11.159
Stay there.

01:23:13.229 --> 01:23:14.262
You stay right there.

01:23:14.329 --> 01:23:15.430
- What color?
- Black.

01:23:31.646 --> 01:23:33.815
What color's the next door?

01:23:33.881 --> 01:23:35.083
Ah! Blue.

01:24:04.546 --> 01:24:06.015
You fucking..

01:25:11.247 --> 01:25:13.849
I think we should put, um, the..

01:25:13.916 --> 01:25:16.185
Girls, don't leave
the bikes outside.

01:25:16.251 --> 01:25:18.587
- Take them in the backyard.
- Okay, mom.

01:25:18.654 --> 01:25:20.088
Thanks so much, sweetie.

01:25:20.154 --> 01:25:22.992
The biggest prophet must be
out..

01:25:33.167 --> 01:25:34.670
- <i>Czesc.</i>
- Hi.

01:25:34.737 --> 01:25:36.572
You're so sweet.

01:25:39.975 --> 01:25:41.675
Anna.

01:25:41.743 --> 01:25:43.145
Anna, come with me.

01:25:43.212 --> 01:25:46.215
What the fu.. What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:25:47.615 --> 01:25:49.917
Go inside. Go inside.

01:25:56.725 --> 01:25:58.194
Get away from us.

01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:02.998
Fuck you.

01:26:16.511 --> 01:26:18.779
'Ms. Koslow?'

01:26:18.846 --> 01:26:22.451
'Ms. Koslow?
Ms. Koslow, is that you?'

01:26:22.516 --> 01:26:23.851
Surprise.

01:26:23.918 --> 01:26:26.387
'Ms. Koslow?'

01:26:26.454 --> 01:26:27.555
Everything is ready, sir.

01:26:30.492 --> 01:26:32.394
- Hey.
- I just got word from Leonard.

01:26:32.461 --> 01:26:34.663
Koslow has taken a hostage.

01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:36.664
- He wants to talk to the press.
- 'I know.'

01:26:36.730 --> 01:26:38.833
'Aideg
has granted me his authority.'

01:26:39.568 --> 01:26:41.470
I'm going out there.

01:26:41.537 --> 01:26:43.338
This ends now.

01:28:33.481 --> 01:28:36.051
NYPD, freeze!

01:29:20.195 --> 01:29:21.296
Where are they?

01:29:36.377 --> 01:29:37.679
Stand up.

01:29:39.648 --> 01:29:41.483
Shut up or I'm gonna kill her.

01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:43.284
Shut up.

01:29:43.351 --> 01:29:46.488
Now, we're gonna play a game,
okay?

01:29:46.555 --> 01:29:48.190
Where is he?

01:29:53.994 --> 01:29:55.831
'Where's our friend?'

01:30:16.784 --> 01:30:18.820
Sit down.

01:30:29.698 --> 01:30:34.069
I will cut your tongue out
like I did with your friend.

01:31:10.538 --> 01:31:13.608
'Hey, Jim,
federal authorities are still proceeding'

01:31:13.675 --> 01:31:15.409
'local chains of command.'

01:31:15.476 --> 01:31:18.279
'10-9, federal authorities
are still proceeding'

01:31:18.346 --> 01:31:20.481
'local chains of command.
Over.'

01:31:20.548 --> 01:31:23.350
'Local authorities
are coming in.'

01:31:23.417 --> 01:31:27.454
Get ready.
Move! Move! Move!

01:31:27.521 --> 01:31:29.623
Get back. Get back.

01:31:29.690 --> 01:31:32.461
'Lead two moving into position.'

01:31:59.354 --> 01:32:01.123
'Hey, Pete?'

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:04.460
'Pete?'

01:32:06.095 --> 01:32:07.930
'It's only me.'

01:32:09.698 --> 01:32:11.467
'Everything's cool.'

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.944
I got the phone
so you can call your wife.

01:32:26.247 --> 01:32:28.116
Welcome.
Ray Barnes, H-I-T supervisor.

01:32:28.182 --> 01:32:29.951
Get me up-to-date.
Where are we?

01:32:30.018 --> 01:32:31.985
Inmate Koslow is holding
CO Slewitt

01:32:32.052 --> 01:32:33.721
up there in the HVAC room.

01:32:33.788 --> 01:32:35.023
There are three shooters
in position.

01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:37.426
One to the north.
We got two more.

01:32:37.493 --> 01:32:39.727
South of these towers.
They're the one with eyes.

01:32:39.793 --> 01:32:42.497
What decision do I need to make
in the next five minutes?

01:32:42.564 --> 01:32:44.466
Well, right now
we're buying time.

01:32:44.533 --> 01:32:46.969
Breach will be through
in 15 minutes.

01:32:47.034 --> 01:32:48.804
H-S still stuck in the traffic.

01:32:48.869 --> 01:32:50.372
'Warden Lenon is giving
Koslow one of our phones'

01:32:50.439 --> 01:32:51.506
so that he can call
his family.

01:32:51.573 --> 01:32:53.075
If he calls the press,
cut the call.

01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:54.509
Copy that.

01:32:57.612 --> 01:33:00.347
- Hello.
- Hey, Sofia, it's me.

01:33:00.414 --> 01:33:02.617
'Baby, what's happening?'

01:33:02.684 --> 01:33:03.650
Hey, baby, are you safe?

01:33:03.717 --> 01:33:05.420
Tell me what's happening?

01:33:05.487 --> 01:33:07.355
Everything is gonna be alright,
sweetheart.

01:33:07.421 --> 01:33:10.725
Just, I got this.
Don't worry.

01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.429
Are you and Anna safe?

01:33:13.494 --> 01:33:16.030
'Yes, we're safe. We're safe.'

01:33:16.097 --> 01:33:18.733
Um, Anna's here,
you wanna talk to her?

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.569
- 'Alright, put her on.'
- Yes.

01:33:20.636 --> 01:33:22.237
Talk to your dad.

01:33:25.173 --> 01:33:26.908
Are you coming home, daddy?

01:33:26.975 --> 01:33:28.443
I'm trying, my love.
I'm trying.

01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:31.680
It's just, uh,
I got held up here. But, um...

01:33:31.747 --> 01:33:35.084
Please, daddy,
come back home. I'm scared.

01:33:36.917 --> 01:33:37.918
I'm trying, my love.

01:33:37.985 --> 01:33:39.387
I'm doing everything I can

01:33:39.454 --> 01:33:42.056
to get home to you
as soon as I can.

01:33:44.059 --> 01:33:46.228
I just, I just want
to tell you that.

01:33:48.095 --> 01:33:50.798
Daddy loves you very much.

01:33:50.864 --> 01:33:52.600
I love you very much.

01:33:53.534 --> 01:33:54.970
Cut the call.

01:33:55.037 --> 01:33:57.405
Put mommy back on.

01:33:57.472 --> 01:33:58.539
Babe..

01:35:05.273 --> 01:35:07.208
'I have a
visual of inmate with a shiv'

01:35:07.274 --> 01:35:08.643
'in the officer's throat.'

01:35:30.331 --> 01:35:32.501
Reds, what you got?

01:35:32.568 --> 01:35:35.036
'Zero movement, sir..'

01:35:35.103 --> 01:35:37.038
- Three?
- 'Negative, sir.'

01:35:37.104 --> 01:35:38.706
'Lost the visual.'

01:35:43.944 --> 01:35:46.581
Slewitt. Wake up.

01:35:48.448 --> 01:35:49.483
Hey?

01:35:51.319 --> 01:35:54.122
God dammit!
What the fuck is he doing?

01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:55.390
Come on.

01:36:03.931 --> 01:36:05.166
What the fuck?

01:36:19.146 --> 01:36:21.882
There you go.

01:36:21.949 --> 01:36:23.317
- Come on.
- Hah!

01:36:23.384 --> 01:36:25.052
That's all you got?

01:36:25.119 --> 01:36:27.889
That's all you got?

01:36:44.037 --> 01:36:45.472
Red 3, you have the shot?

01:36:45.539 --> 01:36:47.108
'Negative. No clean strike.'

01:36:47.175 --> 01:36:49.478
'Repeat, no clean strike.'

01:36:54.483 --> 01:36:55.516
'I have a clean shot.'

01:36:55.582 --> 01:36:57.417
'Repeat, I have a clean shot.'

01:36:57.484 --> 01:37:00.621
- Hostage's clear.
- You're clear hot.

01:38:07.087 --> 01:38:09.122
'We got a survivor.'

01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:11.591
We got somebody. Let's go.

01:38:11.658 --> 01:38:13.393
Give me an ID on the survivor.

01:38:13.461 --> 01:38:16.431
I need an ID on the survivor.

01:38:16.497 --> 01:38:21.503
'Slewitt. S-L-E-W-I-T-T.'

01:38:23.104 --> 01:38:25.507
Well done, Agent Wilcox.

01:38:26.908 --> 01:38:28.510
Good job.

01:38:36.650 --> 01:38:38.987
Get the door. Coming through.

01:38:41.221 --> 01:38:42.590
Go, go!

01:38:46.761 --> 01:38:48.930
'Alright. Let's go!'

01:39:11.619 --> 01:39:12.953
'Alright, we're loaded!'

01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:14.488
'Let's move it out!'

01:39:15.555 --> 01:39:17.425
I'm coming with you.

01:40:50.685 --> 01:40:52.554
You cuff yourself
to his leg.

01:42:11.832 --> 01:42:13.466
I recognized him
on the stretcher.

01:42:13.533 --> 01:42:16.304
Where is he?

01:42:16.369 --> 01:42:18.305
In a motel upstate.

01:42:18.372 --> 01:42:20.909
Address?

01:42:20.975 --> 01:42:22.576
If you shield me from the O-P-R

01:42:22.643 --> 01:42:24.244
investigation
on the Gomez murder...

01:42:24.311 --> 01:42:26.280
You think I'm here to negotiate?

01:42:28.649 --> 01:42:30.918
Who else knows about this?

01:42:30.984 --> 01:42:32.586
You and me.

01:42:32.653 --> 01:42:34.289
You need to fix this.

01:42:35.789 --> 01:42:38.126
No one can save you
from the Gomez investigation

01:42:38.192 --> 01:42:40.095
while Koslow is alive.

01:42:46.868 --> 01:42:50.505
Sunnyside Motel Northern Ave.,
Murray Hill.

01:42:50.572 --> 01:42:51.972
Room?

01:42:54.943 --> 01:42:57.445
3-0-4

01:42:57.511 --> 01:42:59.114
You know what to do.

01:43:02.315 --> 01:43:03.818
I can't.

01:43:06.119 --> 01:43:07.721
I can't.

01:43:11.225 --> 01:43:13.395
If you can't I will.

01:43:13.461 --> 01:43:15.630
Keith, I'm so sorry.

01:43:17.131 --> 01:43:20.234
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- Keith Montgomery?

01:43:20.301 --> 01:43:22.870
I'm special agent Barbara Lee
with O-P-R.

01:43:22.936 --> 01:43:26.207
We have a federal warrant
for your arrest.

01:43:26.274 --> 01:43:29.177
Please put your hands behind
your back. Thumbs together.

01:43:39.987 --> 01:43:41.855
Yeah, we have our target
in custody.

01:43:41.922 --> 01:43:44.024
Meet us at peer 11, Wall Street.

01:43:44.091 --> 01:43:46.795
Don't it just warm your heart
to see the FBI

01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:49.863
and the NYPD finally cooperate.

01:45:23.457 --> 01:45:26.327
Koslow, it's from Wilcox.

01:45:26.393 --> 01:45:29.296
She couldn't get rid
of the tail on your family.

01:45:29.363 --> 01:45:31.798
We need you to lay low
for another month till it gets

01:45:31.865 --> 01:45:34.335
all worked out with
the corrupt prison investigation

01:45:34.402 --> 01:45:36.136
the FBI is conducting.

01:45:36.203 --> 01:45:38.673
She promises you're gonna see
your family soon.

01:45:38.739 --> 01:45:41.376
But you need to go now
before they catch you.
