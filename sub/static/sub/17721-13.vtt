00:01.250 --> 00:02.708
Erica: You know that friend
you have,

00:02.708 --> 00:06.833
the girl who seems to
have it all figured out?

00:06.833 --> 00:09.250
Well, on the surface,
I'm that girl.

00:09.708 --> 00:12.125
And honestly, things have never
been better.

00:12.791 --> 00:14.625
I should be celebrating.

00:14.625 --> 00:17.041
my new promotion,
my new relationship...

00:18.500 --> 00:20.666
my new life.

00:20.666 --> 00:22.583
But isn't funny how...

00:22.583 --> 00:24.875
just when things are finally
moving forward

00:24.875 --> 00:27.333
all you can think about
is the one thing...

00:28.958 --> 00:31.166
that one regret that
will always hold you back.

00:32.708 --> 00:34.875
- Hey, congrats.
- Thanks.

00:34.875 --> 00:37.083
- Erica, hey, I heard.
That's awesome.

00:37.083 --> 00:39.041
- Hi.
- River Rock's newest
junior editor is in da house.

00:39.041 --> 00:40.666
- Oh yeah!

00:40.666 --> 00:43.666
- So, you can say goodbye
to calluses and paper cuts

00:43.666 --> 00:46.583
and say hello
to a company laptop,

00:46.583 --> 00:48.666
an expense account
and a modest raise.

00:48.666 --> 00:50.875
- Wow!

00:50.875 --> 00:53.791
- (Clears throat) Now,
before we make this "o-fish"

00:53.791 --> 00:56.166
you gotta train
your replacement.

00:56.166 --> 00:58.500
- Oh, you already found
a replacement?

00:58.500 --> 01:01.333
- Mm, hello? Someone's gotta
make my morning latte.

01:01.333 --> 01:03.958
Ooh.

01:03.958 --> 01:05.458
And that someone is the very
enthusiastic, Meeri Kung.

01:05.458 --> 01:06.958
And she's right on time.

01:06.958 --> 01:09.000
- Good morning, boss.
Hi, Erica.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.625
- Hey, Meeri.
- I brought doughnuts.

01:13.291 --> 01:15.916
'Kay, check the milk. Make sure
it's steamed to 180 degrees.

01:15.916 --> 01:18.500
And only use organic espresso
beans

01:18.500 --> 01:21.250
because believe or not
Julianne knows the difference.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.458
- Oh. Righteous. Organic only.

01:24.666 --> 01:27.000
So, you must be very excited?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.625
- Yeah, it's, um...
it's a great step forward.

01:29.625 --> 01:31.458
- Step forward? Ah...

01:31.458 --> 01:33.708
You are like this rising star.

01:33.708 --> 01:35.708
- Thank you, Meeri,
that's very flattering,

01:35.708 --> 01:37.666
but I think that...
you're overstating things

01:37.666 --> 01:39.500
about a thousand percent.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.750
- (chuckles) Seriously?
I mean, you were me,

01:41.750 --> 01:43.541
You know, Julianne's new
assistant,

01:43.541 --> 01:45.041
just a few months ago.

01:45.041 --> 01:47.000
I mean, you must be
over the moon.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.958
- Okay, milks done,
ready to pour.

01:48.958 --> 01:51.666
Oh, can I try?
- Sure.

01:57.416 --> 02:00.208
- Wow. You've done this before.

02:00.208 --> 02:02.416
- I dabble in latte art.
On the side.

02:05.958 --> 02:08.625
- You know, just because
I'm junior editor,

02:08.625 --> 02:10.125
doesn't mean I get
a longer lunch.

02:10.125 --> 02:12.375
- Well, today is different
because we're celebrating.

02:12.375 --> 02:14.416
- Celebrating?
- Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.833
- Hey.
- Hi. (excited squeal)

02:19.500 --> 02:21.208
Wow, this is kind of...

02:21.208 --> 02:22.625
- Awkward?
- Awkward!

02:22.625 --> 02:25.958
Oh my God, we're such losers.

02:25.958 --> 02:27.541
I'm sorry, I just...

02:27.541 --> 02:29.458
I'm not really sure how
I'm supposed to act right now.

02:29.458 --> 02:30.958
Hey, we're just going
for lunch.

02:30.958 --> 02:32.666
We don't have to rush anything.

02:32.666 --> 02:34.875
- Yeah. Of course.

02:34.875 --> 02:36.916
- But I was thinking, if you
don't have any plans tomorrow,

02:36.916 --> 02:38.583
maybe we could drive up
to Stratford and see a play?

02:40.250 --> 02:42.458
Or not, if it's too fast,
then I understand.

02:44.583 --> 02:48.541
- No, it's fine. It's just,
uh... tomorrow...

02:54.000 --> 02:56.583
- What's wrong, Erica?
You okay?

02:56.583 --> 02:58.541
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

02:58.541 --> 03:00.291
Sorry, I'm just a little...
a little out of it.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.833
- Don't worry about
this weekend, okay?

03:03.833 --> 03:05.708
It's probably a bit too soon.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.458
- You know what?
I would love to.
- What?

03:10.125 --> 03:11.500
- I would love to go

Today is the December 13th.
and, um...

05:07.791 --> 05:09.583
- Agh. Jesus, I can't believe
I forgot.

05:09.583 --> 05:11.083
I'm such an idiot.

05:11.083 --> 05:12.583

Hey, I mean, we can go up
to Stratford any time.

05:16.916 --> 05:18.208
Today you should be
with your family.

05:18.208 --> 05:20.625
- No, I don't want to be.

05:20.625 --> 05:23.041
- Why not?
- Because it's-it's always
the same thing every year,

05:23.041 --> 05:24.750
you know. I mean,

05:24.750 --> 05:26.791
we used to love going
to my grandmother's farm,

05:26.791 --> 05:29.291
But ever since Leo died
we only go up once a year.

05:29.291 --> 05:31.625
It's kind of become
our unofficial graveyard.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.708
And when this time of year
comes around,

05:34.708 --> 05:36.708
I always wake up in the morning
with this feeling,

05:36.708 --> 05:38.958
Like, you know, I just
wanna crawl back into bed
and cry and...

05:40.583 --> 05:41.958
You know, just shut
everything out.

05:41.958 --> 05:44.000
It's always been that way...

05:44.000 --> 05:46.541
Except for yesterday.

05:46.541 --> 05:48.375
- Why?
- Because of you,

05:50.000 --> 05:51.833
And the promotion and
everything.

05:51.833 --> 05:55.541
I mean... my life, it's really
wonderful right now.

05:55.541 --> 05:57.416
And I just...
I wanna feel that.

05:57.416 --> 05:59.250
I wanna enjoy that.

05:59.250 --> 06:01.208
But it's like I can't, you know?

06:01.208 --> 06:02.875
And then you asked me
to go to Stratford,

06:02.875 --> 06:06.250
And I felt so guilty for feeling
even a spark of happiness

06:06.250 --> 06:08.833
for even wanting to say yes
to the weekend.

06:10.291 --> 06:12.666

06:14.250 --> 06:15.458

06:17.000 --> 06:18.458
- Taking you to see your family.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.125
- You know what, Ethan?
That's really sweet,

06:20.125 --> 06:21.541
but you've gone through
so much trouble...

06:21.541 --> 06:23.250
- Hey, hey-hey,
don't worry about me.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.333
Erica, I don't know what
it's like to lose a brother,

06:26.333 --> 06:28.666
but there are a lot of different
ways to remember a person.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
You say you don't want it
to be the same this year,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.458
so, don't let it be.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.916

Yesterday I told mom that I
didn't wanna come up this year.

07:45.958 --> 07:47.791
That I need to move on.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.166
I just realized, you know,
that the way that we do this,

07:52.166 --> 07:54.083
it doesn't... it doesn't feel
right anymore.

Erica.

08:06.125 --> 08:07.958
Everyone deals with these
things their own way.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.208
- Yeah, but it seems to me,
dad, that we all deal
with it the same way.

08:12.208 --> 08:14.041
Which is... to say that...
I mean, we don't deal with it.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.041
- Erica, please.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.458
- Mom, I know that
you don't agree.

08:18.458 --> 08:20.250
And didn't come up here
to complicate things,

08:20.250 --> 08:22.333

08:22.333 --> 08:24.625
about how we might do things
differently this year.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.875
So, I'm just gonna
put it out there.

08:30.916 --> 08:32.875

08:36.833 --> 08:40.250
- Rebuild the barn?
- Why not?

08:40.250 --> 08:41.875
It's something that
we could all do together.

08:43.458 --> 08:44.791
I mean, at least we can start
clearing

08:44.791 --> 08:46.291
some of this stuff out of here.

08:46.291 --> 08:47.875
Sam: Leo always liked
building things.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.000
- Remember the treehouse?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.041
- And the time that he tried
to build the trap door

08:52.041 --> 08:54.000
and it almost too out
the entire floor.

08:55.541 --> 08:57.083

08:57.083 --> 08:59.291
Yeah, let's do this. We can...

08:59.291 --> 09:00.833
I mean, we can rebuild the barn
in Leo's memory.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.666
We can make it big
and beautiful.

09:05.666 --> 09:07.958
Sam: Make it like a memorial.

09:07.958 --> 09:10.250
- It's your mother's property.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.250
It's really up to her.

09:18.208 --> 09:20.583
- If that's what you all
feel we should do,

10:53.875 --> 10:55.708

10:59.125 --> 11:00.458
- Leo.
- Yeah.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.125
Go ahead and tell me.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.541
- He was 21 when he died.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.125
That weekend, we were up
at the farm

11:14.125 --> 11:15.833
and things were tense.

11:15.833 --> 11:18.041
He had dropped out
of university... again.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.125
And this time there was nothing

11:20.125 --> 11:21.791
that was gonna make him
go back.

11:21.791 --> 11:23.291
He wanted to go traveling,

11:23.291 --> 11:25.500
and they wanted him
to finish his undergrad.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.291
So he went to hang out
in the barn.

11:27.291 --> 11:30.208
I think he was going to smoke
some weed and calm down.

11:30.208 --> 11:31.541
And nobody knows
exactly what happened,

11:31.541 --> 11:33.666
but the police figure that...

11:33.666 --> 11:36.000
you know, he left the joint
burning and then...

11:36.000 --> 11:37.875
dozed off.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.541
Once the hay caught,
it was just...

11:39.541 --> 11:40.958
it was probably a matter
of minutes

11:40.958 --> 11:42.875
before the whole thing
was on fire.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.666
- And where were you?

11:44.666 --> 11:47.208
- Upstairs, sleeping,
in the house. We all were.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.000
I remember... waking up
to the smell of smoke

11:54.333 --> 11:56.500
and looked out the window
and it...

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
it was like the sky
was on fire.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.625
And we all ran outside,
you know, but it was too late.

12:00.625 --> 12:02.916
If... if he hadn't fallen
asleep,

12:02.916 --> 12:05.166
you know, if he'd been able
to get out...

12:07.125 --> 12:08.625
We hardly ever talk about Leo,

12:08.625 --> 12:11.458
but when we do,
it's always that.

12:11.458 --> 12:13.416
You know, our collective
failure,

12:13.416 --> 12:16.208
how we couldn't reach him
in time.

12:16.208 --> 12:18.166
Honestly, I can't believe
it's taken me this long

12:18.166 --> 12:20.541
to realize how dysfunctional
it is.

12:20.541 --> 12:22.458
No, we never talk
about his life.

12:24.125 --> 12:26.041
(emotional breath)
About how great he was.

12:27.666 --> 12:29.458
- This year you tried
to change that.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.375
- You know, I wanted
to do something

12:31.375 --> 12:33.000
That would help us
let go of it.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.041
Just something positive.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.541
But it didn't work and...

12:38.541 --> 12:40.291
frankly, you know,
I'm not surprised.

12:40.291 --> 12:43.041
- Why's that?

12:43.041 --> 12:45.083
- Because it is not easy
to let go of something

12:45.083 --> 12:47.375
you've carried for years.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.416
I tried to go to Stratford
with Ethan,

12:50.416 --> 12:52.958
and I couldn't even
make it to the car.

12:52.958 --> 12:55.250
- Erica, you and I,

12:55.250 --> 12:57.458
we have arrived at a...
juncture of sorts here.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.541
You see,

13:06.541 --> 13:08.416
I know this is the one regret
that you've been waiting for,

13:09.916 --> 13:11.625
and that your regret is simply

13:11.625 --> 13:14.041
that you did not wake up
in time

13:14.041 --> 13:16.500
and that you were unable
to go into the barn

13:16.500 --> 13:17.791
and pull your brother out.

13:19.416 --> 13:21.208
Unfortunately, that is not
what this is about.

13:25.333 --> 13:28.041
There are limits
to this therapy and...

13:30.541 --> 13:33.000
right now, we're facing
one of them.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.250
Because no matter how deeply
you regret it,

13:38.458 --> 13:40.916
you are not allowed
to go back and play God.

13:45.791 --> 13:48.291
You are not permitted
to bring back the dead.

13:50.541 --> 13:52.708
- I know.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.416
Interfering with other people's
lives is off limits.

13:55.416 --> 13:57.166
I get it, I do.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.958
- Yeah. I know you know and...

14:00.625 --> 14:03.666
I wish that there was
something that I could do

14:03.666 --> 14:06.125
to help bring you the closure
that you're looking for here,

14:07.625 --> 14:09.208
but... (breathes deeply)

14:11.958 --> 14:14.625
- Maybe there is.

14:14.625 --> 14:17.125
You know, when I think
about Leo now,

14:17.125 --> 14:20.375
I just, I remember the last
conversation that we had.

14:20.375 --> 14:23.125
It just... it's like
I go over it in my mind,

14:23.125 --> 14:26.083
just how pointless it was,
you know?

14:26.083 --> 14:28.541
All the things that
I would've said

14:28.541 --> 14:30.375
if I would have known that
was gonna be the last time.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.333
I don't know? I guess, just...

14:34.000 --> 14:35.833
- That you wish that
you would've said goodbye?

14:36.666 --> 14:38.000
- (half laughs) Yeah.

14:39.458 --> 14:40.916
- Erica.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.583
Listen, I cannot send you back
to save your brother,

14:47.083 --> 14:49.000
But, um... a goodbye...?

14:51.416 --> 14:54.291
That's... that's something
that could be arranged.

14:57.041 --> 14:59.125
- What would you tell him?

15:01.166 --> 15:03.500
- I would tell him
that I loved him.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.375
And then maybe if I can figure
out a way to let him go,

15:09.541 --> 15:12.041
I can help my family
do the same.

15:13.666 --> 15:15.458
- And you will not try
to save his life?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.208
- No, I won't.

15:22.416 --> 15:24.208
I promise.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.333
- (Inhales and exhales)

15:32.458 --> 15:34.541
And so... we return.

15:41.333 --> 15:42.791
Gary: Why are you taking
that tone with us?

15:42.791 --> 15:44.333
We are trying to help you.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.291
- Because you're not
listening to me!

15:46.291 --> 15:48.500
Barbara: Leo!
Leo: You just want
what you want.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.000
- No, that's not true.
- Yes, it is!

15:55.083 --> 15:56.750
- Look I am sick of it.

15:56.750 --> 15:59.083
Sitting in a classroom
being lectured at

15:59.083 --> 16:00.541
is not the only way to learn.

16:00.541 --> 16:02.041
I've been in this bubble
my whole life

16:02.041 --> 16:04.666
and all I'm saying is that now
is the time for me to get out.

16:04.666 --> 16:07.666
- You don't make a decision
like this without a plan.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.750
- Why not?

16:09.750 --> 16:11.416
It's my life.

16:11.416 --> 16:13.208
I can do what I want.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.583
And who knows where
I'll be in 5 years.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.166
Yeah, I don't need to think
about that right now.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.708
- Yes, you do.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.375
- We're not going to bail you
out this time.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.583
- Fine!
- You wanna make your own
choices?

16:22.583 --> 16:25.583
Then you'll suffer
the consequences!
- Whatever!

16:25.583 --> 16:27.083
- Look, I know it's none
of my business,

16:27.083 --> 16:28.833
but I really think you should
go after him right now

16:28.833 --> 16:31.291
'cause wouldn't wanna--
- Stay out of it, Erica.

16:33.541 --> 16:35.791
- Leo. (Knocks on door)

16:35.791 --> 16:37.041
Leo: What?
- Hey.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.708
- (Sighs)

16:43.833 --> 16:45.750
- You want some company?

16:45.750 --> 16:47.416
- I don't need a lecture
from you too.

16:47.416 --> 16:49.166
No, no, lecture, I just...
I just wanna talk.

16:53.416 --> 16:55.416
I mean, there's something
that I want to say to you.

16:57.916 --> 16:59.541
(welling up) Wow, this is
really hard.

16:59.541 --> 17:03.416
- What?

17:03.416 --> 17:05.416
- Hey, you remember that time
that you built that treehouse?

17:05.416 --> 17:08.458
- Look, no offense, but mom
and dad just yelled at me
for an hour

17:10.083 --> 17:11.500
I'm in a bad mood, and I...
- Leo.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.333
I can't talk about the
treehouse right now, okay?

17:16.791 --> 17:18.125
I just...

17:19.833 --> 17:22.166
need to get out of here.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.916
I am going out to the barn.

17:26.916 --> 17:28.750
If mom and dad ask,
tell them I went for a walk.

17:30.541 --> 17:32.125
(Regretful exhale)

17:34.750 --> 17:36.750
(Rock music plays from barn)

17:40.041 --> 17:43.041

17:51.625 --> 17:54.000

(stereo turns off)

17:59.833 --> 18:01.875
- What're you doing?

18:01.875 --> 18:03.875
Look, listen, I know that you
don't wanna talk right now,

18:03.875 --> 18:05.416
but there's something really
important that I have to say,

18:05.416 --> 18:07.500
so, please just listen me.

18:09.416 --> 18:11.708
- Jesus.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.958
Fine.

18:13.958 --> 18:16.250
What is it?
What do you need to say?

18:16.250 --> 18:17.875
- I know that, um...

18:17.875 --> 18:20.583
I never told you this
before, but...

18:20.583 --> 18:23.791
you have been an amazing
brother. The best.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.958
Like, even right now,

18:26.958 --> 18:28.958
I know that you don't want
to talk,

18:28.958 --> 18:30.833
But you're listening to me
anyway

18:30.833 --> 18:34.583
because you can know
that it's important to me.

18:34.583 --> 18:37.083
And you've always been
that way.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.791
You are patient and good
and strong... (crying)

18:44.583 --> 18:46.958
Oh my God, this is
so incredibly hard.

18:46.958 --> 18:48.208
- Erica, what's wrong?
Why are you crying?

18:50.666 --> 18:52.541
- I can't... I-I can't!

18:54.291 --> 18:56.333
- You-you can't what?

18:56.333 --> 18:58.750
- (Cries)

18:58.750 --> 19:01.375
- I can't... I can't do this.

19:01.375 --> 19:03.583
I can't do this.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.916
(Bag crinkles)

19:06.916 --> 19:08.750
(Anguished grunt
and heavy breaths)

19:13.750 --> 19:15.250
- Erica?

19:16.791 --> 19:18.333
(Erica breathes heavily)

19:19.791 --> 19:21.666
Erica? Erica?!

19:25.666 --> 19:27.625
Erica!

19:27.625 --> 19:29.458
Erica, come here!

19:30.916 --> 19:32.750
Erica!

19:32.750 --> 19:34.875
(Doors thud open)
(Erica breaths heavily)

19:38.666 --> 19:40.541
- Dr. Tom.

19:40.541 --> 19:42.875
- What've you done?

19:42.875 --> 19:45.208
- I... I didn't have a choice.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.583
- Really?

19:50.500 --> 19:53.958
- Okay, fine, I did have
a choice.

19:53.958 --> 19:55.416
And you can think
whatever you want

19:55.416 --> 19:57.291
because if have to choose
between this therapy

19:59.375 --> 20:02.458
and my brother?
I choose Leo.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.750
- You made a promise.

20:06.625 --> 20:08.708
You made a commitment, Erica.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.375
You sat right here
in this office,

20:11.375 --> 20:13.791
you sat in this office,

20:13.791 --> 20:15.416
You made a commitment to me
and then you...

20:15.416 --> 20:16.875
- This has nothing to do
with you.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.291
- (Yells) This has everything
to do with me!

20:27.750 --> 20:29.666
(Calming breaths)

20:33.083 --> 20:35.958
You have thrown away months
of work that we've done here.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.958
And you have shown
by your decision here today

20:38.958 --> 20:41.541
that you have learned nothing.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.666
- That's not true.
- I don't wanna hear it.

20:43.666 --> 20:46.291
- No, this is,
this is different.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.666
- Get out.

20:48.666 --> 20:51.791
- What?

20:51.791 --> 20:55.083
- Go, get out of my office.
Get out!

20:55.083 --> 20:58.041
- Don't! Let go of me.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.958
You're hurting me!

21:01.625 --> 21:03.541
(Shaky breaths)

21:14.500 --> 21:16.250
Sorry. (Shaky breaths)

21:17.916 --> 21:19.875
(Office phones ring,
din of chatter)

21:22.958 --> 21:25.791
(Elevator door rattle shut)

21:25.791 --> 21:27.791
(Phone rings)

21:47.333 --> 21:48.666
- Hello?

21:50.333 --> 21:52.000
(Elevator bell dings,
din of office chatter)

21:54.375 --> 21:56.333
(Phones ring)

22:07.666 --> 22:10.208
(Phone keys clack)
Julianne: Erica.

22:10.208 --> 22:12.708
Hi there, stranger. (Titters)

22:12.708 --> 22:14.500
Get it? 'Cause your last name
is Strange.

22:16.041 --> 22:19.000
Anyway, what can I do for you?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.791
Hm? How 'bout a latte?

22:20.791 --> 22:23.333
Start the day off right
with a bang, huh, okay?

22:23.333 --> 22:27.208
Of course, right, uh, a latte,
I'll... coming right up.

22:27.208 --> 22:29.750
- Um... Oh. I...
(clears throat)

22:33.791 --> 22:36.083
- She waved at me.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.166
- Why would she do that?

22:38.166 --> 22:40.083
- What, you think she's working
some kind of strategy?

22:40.083 --> 22:42.333
- Maybe. She never slums it
over here in non-fiction.

22:43.875 --> 22:46.083
She must be working an angle.

22:46.083 --> 22:48.000
- Meeri, go do some recon.
Go-go-go.

22:49.666 --> 22:51.291
- Uh, you don't have
to make yourself a latte.

22:52.666 --> 22:55.041
Unless you want to.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.500
I could do it for you.
Whatever works.

22:58.041 --> 22:59.500
- Uh, this is for Julianne.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.250
Go for it, Meeri,
you're the pro.

23:01.250 --> 23:03.666
- Um... Erica? I was, uh...

23:05.291 --> 23:06.958
I was wondering if I could ask
you something?

23:06.958 --> 23:08.791
- Yeah.

23:08.791 --> 23:11.625
- I, uh, I have this novel
that I've been working on.

23:11.625 --> 23:13.375
- Uh-huh.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.250
- I was wondering if I could
give it to someone

23:15.250 --> 23:16.708
in your coverage department?

23:16.708 --> 23:18.166
And I know they're busy reading
real works

23:18.166 --> 23:21.583
by real authors that...
- Meeri!

23:21.583 --> 23:24.833
Oh, I apologize profusely

23:24.833 --> 23:27.250
for that wildly inappropriate
request.

23:27.250 --> 23:29.333
And please let me just
say congratulations

23:29.333 --> 23:31.125
on the huge success
of "A crowded reality".

23:32.916 --> 23:34.958
New York Times Best-seller.

23:34.958 --> 23:37.291
Hello? I mean, honestly,

23:37.291 --> 23:40.000
what you've done as managing
director of fiction,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.416
I was so impressed,
it's bordering on jealousy.

23:42.416 --> 23:44.125
I've been meaning to head over
to the fiction department

23:44.125 --> 23:45.916
to tell you myself.
- Managing director.

23:47.583 --> 23:50.166
- I just had the best idea.

23:50.166 --> 23:51.875
- Lunch, sush, my office,
my treat.

23:53.625 --> 23:55.125
I would kill to pick your brain

23:55.125 --> 23:56.833
about some of those
marketing strategies

23:56.833 --> 23:59.583
that you've come up with
in the past, in-in...

23:59.583 --> 24:01.416
- Julianne, I just realized
that, um...

24:01.416 --> 24:03.250
I have a... a meeting
that I have to go to.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.583
- Oh. Yes.

24:05.583 --> 24:07.833
Um, you can keep the milk too.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.083
How does she pull in those
numbers?

24:11.083 --> 24:12.833
Oh my God, I've never wanted
to be another person more

24:12.833 --> 24:15.083
in my entire life.

24:15.083 --> 24:17.875
- This boy's extreme makeover
starts with that sweater.

24:17.875 --> 24:19.541
Sasha fierce.

24:22.958 --> 24:25.958
- (over phone)

- Can I help you?

I'm so sorry. Um, I just...

25:19.541 --> 25:21.791
What's wrong?

25:21.791 --> 25:23.208

25:41.791 --> 25:44.916
Leo: So, where are you
coming from? Erica.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.375
How'd you get here?

25:48.375 --> 25:50.791
- I don't know, I, um...
(stammers) I walked.

25:50.791 --> 25:54.041
- What? From home?

25:54.041 --> 25:56.458
- Maybe she fell?
Maybe she had an accident?

25:56.458 --> 25:58.000
Do you think we should
call an ambulance?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.833
- Mom, just don't overreact,
okay?

26:01.916 --> 26:04.083
- Do you know who I am?

26:04.083 --> 26:05.750
- Of course I know
who you are, mom.

26:05.750 --> 26:08.208
Look, you guys, I'm fine.

26:08.208 --> 26:11.208
- Who's Samantha?
- Samantha is my sister.

26:11.208 --> 26:13.666
She is a neurosurgeon
and she's married to Josh.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.333
- Josh?
- What? They broke up

26:18.333 --> 26:20.291

Oh, thank God.

26:21.833 --> 26:23.708
- You need to see a doctor.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.833
- Why don't I just call Annie?

26:25.833 --> 26:27.625
- Who's annie?
- Erica?

26:30.041 --> 26:32.166
Do you remember that
I talked to you last night

26:32.166 --> 26:34.583
and said I was coming over here
to help mom with the plans?

26:36.041 --> 26:38.291
- The plans?

26:38.291 --> 26:40.750
- I'm an architect, remember?

26:40.750 --> 26:42.208
Of course, yeah, I know,
it's-it's, uh...

26:42.208 --> 26:44.375
It's all coming back to me now.

26:44.375 --> 26:46.875
- Sam? Sam, can you come over?

26:46.875 --> 26:48.625
No, I need you right now.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.708
Your sister can't remember
anything.

26:52.708 --> 26:55.000
- Erica.
- Yes?

26:57.125 --> 26:59.375
Sorry. (Laughs) Sorry.

26:59.375 --> 27:01.000
- Just stop staring, seriously,

27:01.000 --> 27:02.458
you're really starting
to worry me.

27:02.458 --> 27:04.083
- No-no-no, Leo,
I don't want to worry you.

27:04.083 --> 27:06.333
Mom! Mom, I don't need
a doctor, okay?

27:06.333 --> 27:08.875
I just, I, um...

27:08.875 --> 27:10.333
I got a little wasted
last night,

27:10.333 --> 27:13.041
so I'm kind of hung over.
- You got wasted?

27:14.875 --> 27:17.000
Wait a minute, aren't you
supposed to be at work?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.916
Yes. No, I'm not...
you know what?

27:18.916 --> 27:20.333
I don't wanna talk
about me right now, okay?

27:20.333 --> 27:21.750
Let's-let's talk about you.

27:23.416 --> 27:25.375

27:40.166 --> 27:42.125
Oh God, you're not
still married, are you?

why don't you go and lie down

27:48.458 --> 27:51.041

27:51.041 --> 27:54.041
That probably a good idea.
Right.

27:54.041 --> 27:55.666
Okay.

- The title of dad's last book?

- Um, the title, uh...
uh, dad's book?

28:36.583 --> 28:38.291

about outer space and aliens.

28:42.041 --> 28:44.166

that's been affected.

28:44.166 --> 28:46.875
- Oh my God, is she gonna be
okay?

28:46.875 --> 28:48.500

into to the hospital

38:22.041 --> 38:24.291
I love you guys. Leo."

38:28.875 --> 38:30.958
- (Teary) God, he was such
a good kid.

38:30.958 --> 38:33.291
- An amazing brother.

38:33.291 --> 38:35.666
- Yeah.

38:35.666 --> 38:37.208
- He was never afraid
of anything,

38:37.208 --> 38:39.583
right from the start.
you know?

38:42.083 --> 38:44.875
If he was here right now,

38:44.875 --> 38:47.500
I wonder what he'd be doing?

38:47.500 --> 38:49.916
- Probably be living on a boat
somewhere in Asia.

38:49.916 --> 38:51.500
(Laugh in agreement)

38:51.500 --> 38:54.833
- Doing humanitarian work
in Africa.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.750
- You know, I...

38:56.750 --> 38:58.541
I think he would have got
a lot of the adventuring

38:58.541 --> 39:00.625
out of his system and...

39:00.625 --> 39:04.125
and that he would want
to settle down with a nice girl

39:04.125 --> 39:06.458
and work here, you know,
close to his family.

39:08.083 --> 39:09.625
Maybe as an architect.
- An architect?

39:11.166 --> 39:13.041
- He loved building things.

39:13.041 --> 39:14.625
Like the treehouse.
- Oh, crazy treehouse.

39:16.375 --> 39:19.958
(All laughs)

39:19.958 --> 39:21.958
He nearly broke his neck
falling out of that thing.

39:21.958 --> 39:23.375

he bashed his hand

39:55.666 --> 39:58.041
and he started bleeding
insanely everywhere.

39:58.041 --> 40:00.166
So, we decided that
it would be better

40:00.166 --> 40:01.875
to hire a construction crew.

40:01.875 --> 40:04.208
Yeah. So, we're gonna
meet with him next week.

40:04.208 --> 40:06.083
- That's great.
- Yeah.

40:07.833 --> 40:10.833
I mean, it was, uh...
it was really intense.

40:10.833 --> 40:13.541
But just being them
and talking about Leo,

40:13.541 --> 40:15.833
Ethan, it felt so good.

40:15.833 --> 40:19.291
You know, all those memories
that we'd been trying to ignore.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.583
To finally share them
with each other,

40:20.583 --> 40:22.625
it was like... in a way...

40:24.833 --> 40:27.208
he came alive, you know?

40:27.208 --> 40:29.291
And I have you to thank for that

40:29.291 --> 40:31.541
because I don't think that
it would've happened this way,

40:31.541 --> 40:33.541
if you hadn't given me the push.

40:33.541 --> 40:35.000
- No, Erica, it's...

40:35.000 --> 40:36.416
- No, really. Look, I just...

40:36.416 --> 40:38.333
I always knew that the way
that we dealt with Leo's death,

40:38.333 --> 40:40.666
it wasn't working, but...
(inhales)

40:40.666 --> 40:43.875
I mean, I was just...
I was gonna ignore it.

40:43.875 --> 40:47.458
So, thank you for giving me
that kick.

40:47.458 --> 40:49.125
- Well, I owed you.

40:49.125 --> 40:52.125
You did the same for me
with Claire.

40:52.125 --> 40:55.125
Erica... I've spent
all these years

40:55.125 --> 40:57.458
trying not to notice
how beautiful you are.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.666
And these past few months
it's been almost impossible.

41:02.666 --> 41:05.166
It's like...
- It's like?

41:07.750 --> 41:10.000
It's like what?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.625
- It's like I think

42:33.250 --> 42:35.000
Hi.

42:42.125 --> 42:44.375
Where am I?

42:44.375 --> 42:47.000
- This is my office.

42:49.208 --> 42:50.625
- What's going on?

42:52.291 --> 42:54.708
- I know you and Dr. Tom
have hit a bit of a snag.

42:56.041 --> 42:59.125
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

42:59.125 --> 43:00.541
He's taking a leave of absence.

43:02.083 --> 43:05.125
- A leave of absence?

43:05.125 --> 43:06.750
- Uh... I'm sorry, I...

43:08.208 --> 43:10.083
I just, um...

43:10.083 --> 43:12.041
- Can I get you anything? Tea?

43:13.500 --> 43:15.875
- No, thank you.

43:17.916 --> 43:20.666
So, just to clarify,
who are you?

43:21.833 --> 43:25.333
- I'm Naadiah.
Your new therapist.
