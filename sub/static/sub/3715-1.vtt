[Choir singing]

02:10.631 --> 02:15.336
(Adira narrating)
This story, although set
in the past, is about the future

02:17.238 --> 02:19.673
Where I know freedom is.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.747
In the smallest of things

02:27.981 --> 02:31.285
I see the flicker of hope.

Go!
[Feet rustling]

04:15.523 --> 04:19.459

No one can shackle the hope
that is hidden in our hearts.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.531
If only you will believe it,
Samuel.

[Match striking]

04:27.034 --> 04:28.336
You're late.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.971
I got held up.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.441

05:05.739 --> 05:08.709
Didn't hold Jerome
long enough off cabin 15.

05:10.110 --> 05:13.614
You go ahead.
Meet you at the bridge.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.616

He'll be by soon, son.
Come on.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.951
(Adira narrating)
Even as we make our way
toward freedom

06:23.984 --> 06:27.521
Would it ever be possible to
leave behind what we'd endured?

Jesus...

07:54.307 --> 07:56.009
He's had enough!

[Laboured breathing]

08:03.250 --> 08:04.718
Where are the others?

Big Hand yelps]

08:18.265 --> 08:19.633
Where are they?

08:26.674 --> 08:29.042
If they get away
because of your stupidity...

08:29.076 --> 08:30.978
[Fabric rustling]

08:32.846 --> 08:34.815
Now you leave him
strung up, yeah? Mm?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.017
(Monroe)
And get a hold of Plimpton.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.719
Plimpton?

08:38.751 --> 08:40.953
I want my property back

11:09.737 --> 11:11.171
And this is Jim.

Hello, son.

You've done well.

Big Hand?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.150
I see.

11:29.990 --> 11:34.194
[Water lapping]

11:36.029 --> 11:39.099
(Adira narrating)
We begun our long journey
north with Mr. Garrett

11:39.132 --> 11:42.736
On pathways known only
to the Underground Railroad.

11:42.770 --> 11:43.937
[Adira coughing]

11:43.971 --> 11:45.739

Mr. Garrett! Come on.

In here.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.465
Mm-hm.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.370
Woulda never happened
in his old man's day.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.006
I heard tell...

12:53.040 --> 12:54.875
(Monroe interrupting)
My father was a fool, Plimpton.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.410
Took the concept
of Christian charity too far.

12:57.978 --> 12:58.912
Get out.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.316
Slave's expensive, Plimpton.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.152
And the Underground Railroad now

13:05.185 --> 13:07.888
They are targeting
slave owners in Virginia.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.990
I'm retired.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.159
[Soft thump]

13:12.192 --> 13:14.061
And there's more when
they all get recaptured.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.898
All? What,
there's more than one?

13:18.365 --> 13:22.836
There's Samuel, his son,
the old woman, and Vanessa.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.138
They're gonna be easy to track.

13:25.172 --> 13:28.541
No slave has ever escaped
from my plantation.
[Liquid sloshing]

13:30.110 --> 13:31.979
Why don't you send Jerome?

13:32.445 --> 13:34.247
(Monroe)
I want them back
before they insight the others.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.816
Garrett's part of it.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.452
Garrett?

13:39.486 --> 13:42.389
Him and his Quaker cohort they
are a menace to our industry.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.958
The entire economy
of Virginia is at risk.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.996
Monroe, I am no longer
in the slave hunting business.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.531
Now, now, you just -
you made a mistake, Plimpton.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.967
Made you weak.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.171
(Monroe)
Don't let your conscience
get in the way of business.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.474
How's 500 dollars?

14:02.142 --> 14:04.444
I'll give you another thousand
when you bring

14:05.345 --> 14:06.980
(Monroe)
And that's including Vanessa.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.616
Oh, you can't let her go,
can ya?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.022
[Slurping sound]

14:16.623 --> 14:18.425
How

14:18.458 --> 14:21.494
She's of no use to me.
She's too old and too sick.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.965
They're gonna be headed north.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.900
I'm sending one of my boys
with you.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.135
I don't need a babysitter.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.502
He will look after my interest.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.040
They will all be in church
on Sunday.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.208
[Coin tinkling]

14:36.609 --> 14:38.578
(Monroe)
Get yourself a shave.

14:40.547 --> 14:44.517
[Crickets chirping]

15:04.604 --> 15:05.605
You've done well.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.942
Most don't make it this far.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.078
We had help, Mr. Garrett.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.613
Jim.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.419
(Vanessa)
Thank you, Mr. Garrett.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.321
Our lives have been...
[Fire crackling]

15:23.123 --> 15:25.158
Adira's been a slave
all her life.

15:26.393 --> 15:29.162
And my son has never seen
the sun rise

15:29.196 --> 15:30.597
Without the threat
of a whipping.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.467
One day, we pray.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.603
Ain't be the white man's God
she pray to.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.670
Samuel...

15:38.538 --> 15:41.241
Freedom, Samuel.
God willing.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.044
(Garrett)
Freedom.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.012
[Samuel scoffs]

15:49.582 --> 15:51.084
Why you do this, Mr. Garrett?

15:52.485 --> 15:54.221
Sammy, you have to trust.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.224
Like your momma trusted Monroe?

15:59.592 --> 16:01.628
He gonna want you back, Nessa.
[Vanessa sighs]

16:01.661 --> 16:02.662
You're his blood.

16:06.299 --> 16:12.205
[Adira humming
Amazing Grace]

16:17.377 --> 16:21.748
(Adira)
* Twas grace that brought us

16:21.781 --> 16:25.285
* Safe thus far

16:26.319 --> 16:31.624
[Humming continues]

16:31.658 --> 16:33.293
Pa used to sing that song.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.164
He loved to sing.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.233
You refuse to sing.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.670
(Adira)
One day you will, son.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.707
Amazing Grace.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.278
That saved a wretch like me?

16:53.213 --> 16:56.249
I was Jim's age
when I first heard it.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.287
And the story of the man
who wrote it.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.456
An infamous slave trader.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.626
(Adira)
A wretch like you, Samuel.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.499
But he loved to sing.
[Men laughing in the background]

17:13.099 --> 17:16.236
* Kings and queens
And oh the man in the moon *

17:16.269 --> 17:20.339
* A broken mirror doesn't mean
That someone will die soon *
[Footsteps]

17:21.540 --> 17:25.244
* A black cat isn't all bad luck
And redheads won't sink a boat *
[Cups clicking]

17:26.546 --> 17:30.350
* If you're drowning in the sea
Will God keep you afloat? *

17:30.650 --> 17:33.320
Yeah!

17:33.353 --> 17:35.722
Get out!
[Ruckus]
[Men yelling and laughing]

17:38.258 --> 17:40.393
[Soft background music]

17:40.427 --> 17:42.495
Congratulation, Captain Newton.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.297
Thank you, Mr. Barton.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.533
Oh, and, uh, bravo!

17:46.566 --> 17:48.668
I remember a song you wrote
about old captain Pennrose.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.071
Cruel, Newton, but very witty.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.275
But I cannot believe
you actually bought shares

17:55.308 --> 17:56.576
On the

17:57.277 --> 17:59.279
After Pennrose died,
I acquired his half

17:59.312 --> 18:01.114
And am now in partnership
with Amos Clowe.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.284
Amos Clowe?

18:04.317 --> 18:07.420
Clowe owns the slave factory
on the Plantain Islands

18:07.454 --> 18:09.789
And this will be our
first shipment to Charleston.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.428
I know you've had difficulties
with Amos, Newton.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.364
He promised me
an apprenticeship, Barton

18:18.631 --> 18:20.300
But he treated me
like an animal.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.369
Like one of his slaves.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.638
He actually chained
and starved me for 18 months.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.507
It's all in the past.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.343
It's all a means to a good end.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.245
[Footsteps]

18:32.279 --> 18:33.680
And now, as we always planned

18:33.713 --> 18:35.615
You have the opportunity
to share in the profits

18:36.383 --> 18:37.717
Captain Newton.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.421
Now, I have to go to Charleston
to set up the slave market.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.323
I'll meet you there

in Africa.

Your fiancée
will want for nothing.
[Soft thud]

will take care of the cargo.

of Barton's ship.

I don't own it, nor the cargo.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.350
To me, and I'm sure
to your fellow parishioners

19:43.383 --> 19:44.984
And most of this nation,
it is just business.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.469
God has given you
very little, Ozias.

33:58.504 --> 34:01.073
Mr. Amos taught me to speak
English with this book.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.076
But God's words have taught me
so much more.

34:05.344 --> 34:06.645
God's words?

34:07.746 --> 34:10.081
(Newton)
Surely just written
by mere mortal men.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.851
It wasn't God
who came in the night

34:12.884 --> 34:14.520
And gave me food
and saved my life.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.324
You were treated so very poorly
by Mr. Clowe.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.730
I was flogged on board
his Majesty's man-of-war

34:24.763 --> 34:26.532
Ozias, for desertion.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.801
And now I'm in command
of a slave ship.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.837
I'm the captain of a slave ship.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.643
I've learned to expect
nothing from God.

34:41.213 --> 34:44.416
I remember one night,
the slave factory.

34:46.252 --> 34:47.619
I cried out in the dark

34:47.652 --> 34:50.589
Your servant listens

34:51.857 --> 34:55.261
A huge roar split the heavens,
I fell to my knees.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.630
I saw the trees bow
in His honor

34:58.664 --> 35:01.400
I heard the Lord speak my name

35:01.433 --> 35:03.402
In the rustle
of the barb leaves.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.237
God spoke to me.

35:08.174 --> 35:10.576
Tell me this, then, Ozias.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.312
Why does your just
and merciful God

35:13.745 --> 35:16.448
Condemn good people
like you and me to slavery?

35:17.949 --> 35:20.452
There are no good people,
John Newton.

35:20.952 --> 35:26.292
We are all dogs, hunted,
shackled, enslaved.

35:29.661 --> 35:32.231
That is why we need God.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.666
[Piercing shriek]

35:34.700 --> 35:36.302
(Sailor)
Captain! Captain!

35:36.335 --> 35:37.469
[Panting,
loud thumps]

35:37.503 --> 35:38.670
What's going on?

35:38.704 --> 35:40.439
He was trying
to hang himself, captain.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.646
[Slave speaking
in Gambian dialect]

35:47.679 --> 35:48.914
What is he saying?

35:49.715 --> 35:50.816
(Newton)
Ozias!

35:50.849 --> 35:51.983
He wants to die.
[Slave sobbing]

35:53.219 --> 35:55.387
Tell him we're taking him to
a better place, a new life.

35:55.421 --> 35:58.857
[Ozias speaking
in Gambian dialect]

35:59.591 --> 36:05.264
[Slave speaking
in Gambian dialect]

36:06.398 --> 36:08.200
He wants his freedom.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.569
Some of them are starving
themselves too, captain.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.273
This is valuable cargo,
Mr. Davey.

36:14.306 --> 36:15.707
I can't have slaves
killing themselves.

36:15.741 --> 36:18.644
[Heavy footsteps]

36:22.348 --> 36:23.682
Doctor?

36:23.715 --> 36:25.751
This one is gravely ill.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.520
Her son... I don't know.

36:28.554 --> 36:29.555
What is it?

36:29.588 --> 36:31.857
The flux, captain.
There's nothing to be done.

36:31.890 --> 36:36.228
[Soft murmurs and moaning]

36:40.899 --> 36:44.303
(Adira narrating)
Your great grandfather
was on that ship, Samuel.

36:44.870 --> 36:48.440
A boy struggling
to hold on to hope.

36:49.675 --> 36:53.479
His survival tied to the fate
of captain Newton.

36:55.314 --> 36:58.450
[Hooves pattering]

36:58.484 --> 36:59.985
(McGee)
Woah.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.455
I'll leave you here, Garrett.

37:03.489 --> 37:05.391
(Garrett)
McGee, you take care.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.693
Look out for Plimpton.

37:08.694 --> 37:09.895
Samuel.

37:11.730 --> 37:12.898
Godspeed, y'all.

37:13.865 --> 37:16.568
[Chains rattling,
pattering]

37:16.602 --> 37:19.605
(Musician)
Y'all take good care, now.

37:19.638 --> 37:22.408
(McGee)
You'll make it. Canaan's Land.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.484
(Garrett)
Here it is.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.423
Woah, oh.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.658
You, unhitch the horses, Samuel.

37:40.526 --> 37:41.927
(Vanessa)
Who's inside?

37:41.960 --> 37:43.895
It's a Quaker house.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.697
See that lamp?
It's safe.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.500
(Garrett)
This is where
we'll hide you tonight.

37:49.635 --> 37:51.603
[Rustling]
[Garrett sighing]

37:51.637 --> 37:53.405
- Here you go.
- Come on.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.874
[Adira coughing]

37:56.375 --> 37:57.609
(Garrett)
This way, Jim.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.678
[Knocking]

38:01.547 --> 38:02.981
[Door creaking]

38:03.014 --> 38:04.750
- Yes?
- Watchman...

38:06.885 --> 38:08.987
Morning is coming,
but also the night.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.490
[Chuckling]

38:11.523 --> 38:12.558
Come in, Mr. Garrett.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.326
- Thank you kindly.
- We've been expecting you.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.327
(Garrett)
Come on in.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.467
Here you go.
[Fire crackling]

38:22.000 --> 38:24.770
This here is Samuel Woodward
and his family. William Giddens.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.072
Come in.
You must be hungry.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.574
Very.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.609
(Missouri slave)
There are too many of us.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.444
(Giddens)
These men are from Missouri.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.713
Harriet Tubman brought them
across yesterday.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.315
We cannot all hide here.
There's not enough space.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.785
(Missouri slave)
Harriet told us that four more
free black men

38:39.818 --> 38:41.119
Were kidnapped yesterday.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.388
Now, stay calm.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.891
[Fire crackling]

38:46.157 --> 38:47.459
There you are.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.428
Where're you from?

38:49.461 --> 38:52.030
Ah, the Monroe place.
[Cutlery clicking]

38:53.164 --> 38:56.067
The biggest plantation
in the Norfolk area.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.870
We ran with Mr. Garrett's help.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.039
And God's.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.741
A chair don't build itself.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.779
[Crickets buzzing]

[Band playing music
in the background]

39:16.154 --> 39:21.593
[Whistling rhythmically]

39:21.627 --> 39:23.595
Your boys at the roadblock
were right.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.468
I'll go around this way.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.503
[Loud gunshot]

39:31.803 --> 39:32.871
[Panting]

Boss?

39:33.972 --> 39:35.040
Willie?
[Gun clicking]

39:35.073 --> 39:36.475
- You're next.
- Willie!

39:36.508 --> 39:38.810
Giddens! Giddens
is the first safe house!

39:40.211 --> 39:42.080
(Clem)
Think that Quaker is still
running a safe house?

39:42.681 --> 39:44.416
He's a bigger fool
than the Monroe boy here.

39:44.683 --> 39:47.052
Fool? You're running outta time!

39:47.519 --> 39:48.787
You told Monroe Sunday!

39:48.820 --> 39:52.023
I want no more killing!
You hear me?

39:53.892 --> 39:57.028
You clean yourself up.
We got a long ride ahead of us.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.940
[Distant shouting]
[Horses galloping]

40:10.709 --> 40:11.710
We've got visitors.

40:12.578 --> 40:13.612
Mr. Plimpton I believe.

40:13.645 --> 40:15.080
Samuel?

40:15.113 --> 40:16.782
Is there a gun, Mr. Giddens?

40:16.815 --> 40:18.617
There will be no shooting
in this house!

40:18.650 --> 40:20.752
- They're not taking us back!
- Nessa!

40:21.520 --> 40:24.089
Come on. Out the back. Hitch up
the horses to the back. Go.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.957
There's no time, Samuel.
You need to hide.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.894
- Quickly!
- There are too many of us.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.462
(Plimpton)
They'll be around here
somewhere.

40:30.496 --> 40:31.763
(Samuel)
Come on!

40:31.797 --> 40:33.499
(Garrett)
Jim, stay by me. Adira.

40:33.532 --> 40:34.966
(Missouri slave)
Let's go.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.741
Check this side
and go around the back.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.613
[Persistent knocking]

40:48.780 --> 40:50.181
What can I do for you, mister?

40:50.215 --> 40:53.652
Where's Garrett, conductor
of the Underground Railroad?

40:53.685 --> 40:55.754
(Giddens)
You should board
the train too, sir.

40:55.787 --> 40:59.124
One day we'll all stand
at the terminal before God.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.827
I don't believe in God,
Mr. Giddens.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.129
I got nothing to say to Him.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.073
- Clem!
- Yes, boss.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.675
I know where they are.

41:51.610 --> 41:53.278
You should never play poker,
Mr. Giddens.

41:59.651 --> 42:01.186
This isn't them.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.121
Where are they?
The others.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.790
(Giddens)
Others?

42:04.823 --> 42:06.925
The ones I came for. Garrett and
his passengers from Norfolk.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.860
- Where are they?
- I have nothing to say to you.

42:09.795 --> 42:11.763

and the barn, and find Willie.

42:45.063 --> 42:47.198
You know, you may just hang
for this, Giddens.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.601
We mustn't be afraid
of death, Mr. Plimpton.

42:51.369 --> 42:54.005

- Alive, I said!

43:19.430 --> 43:21.232
What a great help you were.

43:21.266 --> 43:23.034
Go hitch their horses
to the wagon.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.136
And get those slaves
tied up, now!

43:26.337 --> 43:27.372
[Giddens chuckling]

43:27.405 --> 43:30.842
I'm afraid those gentlemen
have gone, Mr. Plimpton.

43:30.876 --> 43:32.911
Out the back door.

43:32.944 --> 43:35.747
You have lost them all.
Dear, dear...

43:35.781 --> 43:37.883
You have broken
a federal law, Mr. Giddens.

43:37.916 --> 43:39.350
The slaves have gone, boss.

43:39.384 --> 43:41.286
The fugitive slave act requires

43:41.319 --> 43:44.189
That you assist in the recapture
of escaping slaves

43:44.222 --> 43:45.924
That is the law, sir.

43:45.957 --> 43:47.859
I follow my conscience,
Mr. Plimpton

43:48.259 --> 43:50.128
Whatever the consequences.

43:50.996 --> 43:54.165
We're just God fearing folk
here. That's all.

43:55.066 --> 43:57.703
God fearing folk
is my biggest problem.

Philips.

44:41.112 --> 44:42.280
Quickly.
They're waiting.

44:43.081 --> 44:45.150
We made it on time.

44:45.183 --> 44:48.286
You connect with the main line
at Woodbridge
that's where you get off.

44:48.319 --> 44:49.955
Then make your way
to Pikesville.

44:49.988 --> 44:51.189
You ain't coming with us?

44:51.222 --> 44:55.060
No. My job is to get you on
the train. And my job is done.

44:55.093 --> 44:57.495
You'll be looked after
every step of the way.

44:57.528 --> 45:00.065
Your first taste of freedom,
Samuel.

45:00.098 --> 45:02.100
- This your compass?
- You're made for it.

This way.

We've been expecting you.

55:38.603 --> 55:39.904
(Actor)
Come on.

55:44.475 --> 55:48.679
I am compelled to request you,
as a gentleman

55:48.713 --> 55:53.451
To shun studiously the society
of Lady Gay Spanker.
[Woman in audience laughing]

55:53.484 --> 55:56.721
Good gracious, wherefore
and by what right

55:56.754 --> 55:59.590
Do you make such a demand?

55:59.624 --> 56:03.661
Why, I am a distant relative
of the Spankers.
[Audience laughing]

56:03.694 --> 56:05.930
Damn, sir, if you don't appear
to be related

56:05.963 --> 56:08.933

this morning.

Mrs. Davenport,
we've been on foot

56:22.112 --> 56:23.914
And our grandmother,
Adira's been ill.

56:23.948 --> 56:27.017
Aw, I'm so sorry.
Please,

56:27.051 --> 56:29.454
Come and make yourself
as comfortable as possible.
[Adira coughing]

56:29.487 --> 56:31.088
And Rose...

56:31.121 --> 56:33.791
- You need some rest.
- No, Rose, sustenance.

56:33.824 --> 56:36.727
Please, sit down.
Sit, sit.
[Distant chatter]

56:39.229 --> 56:41.098

(Samuel)
We got away on a train.

56:44.535 --> 56:45.870
Is someone following you?

Yes sir... ma'am,
by the name of Plimpton.

Esquire.

57:01.051 --> 57:03.988
It's plan B now, darling.
Think graveyard scenario.

57:04.021 --> 57:05.723
Oh, yes, that's always
a crowd pleaser.

57:05.756 --> 57:07.558
You'll have to bunk down
with us here tonight.

57:07.592 --> 57:09.727
Yes, there are men
watching the hall

57:09.760 --> 57:11.529
And we can't be too careful.

57:11.562 --> 57:15.966
Barney, as you can see, thinks
that men are spying on us.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.569
No, they are spying on us dear.
I saw them in the alleyway.
[Fanny chuckling]

57:18.603 --> 57:20.971
But he's always been
a paranoid performer.

57:22.707 --> 57:24.809
My dear, we are slaves
to the critics.

57:25.275 --> 57:27.778
[Adira laughing in delight]

before tomorrow night

57:41.158 --> 57:42.793
Saturday at the latest.

57:43.994 --> 57:46.263
And tomorrow

57:46.296 --> 57:48.699
Creeping its petty pace
from day to day

57:48.733 --> 57:51.268
To the last syllable
of recorded time.

57:51.301 --> 57:54.505
And all our yesterdays
have lighted fools

57:54.539 --> 57:56.807
The way to dusty death.

57:57.174 --> 58:00.945
[Audience applauding]

58:00.978 --> 58:02.613
(Fanny)
We'll do the best we can.

58:02.647 --> 58:05.850
Yes, and we have a cast
of supernumeraries

58:05.883 --> 58:06.984
Just for the occasion.

ask the Bengal tiger!

He's the one that ate him!

58:30.575 --> 58:33.744
[Laughter]

to rehearse for tomorrow.

[Drew playing the piano]

58:37.615 --> 58:40.751
- What do you think about this?
- Yes, Drew. Brilliant, darling!

Beautiful performance
tonight, my dear.

01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:48.913
Oh, really?

01:00:50.715 --> 01:00:53.050
I wasn't sure about the key.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.953
Drew never seems
to get it right.
[Barney chuckling]

01:00:58.288 --> 01:01:00.424
I thought I was a little flat.

01:01:00.457 --> 01:01:02.392
No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.263

[Soft smacking sound]

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:14.004
We must pray for strength and
steel ourselves for tomorrow.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:18.709
Our charges are terrified,
and rightly so.

01:01:21.746 --> 01:01:23.881
Vigilance, my darling girl.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:26.984
For our sakes,
as well as theirs.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:31.088
Yes, there we go.
[Soft rustling]

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:32.823

Now, sit.
Yes, sit, sit.

This ain't never gonna work,
Mr. Barney.

01:01:51.976 --> 01:01:53.878
He's right, Mr. Barney.

01:01:54.278 --> 01:01:57.748
Fanny, are you absolutely sure?

Don't you worry.
[Mournful drums and singing
in the background]

Plimpton's the name.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.969
I'm looking for some
escaped slaves.

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:53.503
Slaves?

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:56.506
God forbid, I don't believe I've
even seen a slave. Have I, dear?

01:02:57.341 --> 01:03:00.110
You ever seen this man?
Thomas Garrett.

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:02.546
Mmm, no. But, uh...

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.550
What a marvelous face.
Uh, allow me, uh...

With modest regards,
Barney Fagan, Esq.
[Paper rustling]

01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:15.125
Now, y'all know

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:17.962
You can go to jail for aiding
and abetting a runaway, right?

01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:20.364
Well, you have my permission
to search our

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:23.400
Well, what some would refer to...
Our theater.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:24.902
Ah...

01:03:24.935 --> 01:03:26.236
How good an actor are you?

Oh, exemplary, sir.

01:03:29.373 --> 01:03:31.375
So there's no way I would know
if you were lying.

[Fanny sobbing and crying
in exaggeration]

01:03:42.953 --> 01:03:45.122
You must excuse me, sir.

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:49.159
One of our troupe has played
his last performance.

01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:51.495
It is a cruel, cruel world.

(Vanessa)
We did it, Sammy!

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:24.561
You did good, son.

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:27.531
Samuel, the perambulator
is yours.

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:30.200
Wagon. He means
you can keep the wagon.

01:04:30.234 --> 01:04:33.203
Yes, one of the best
ensemble pieces ever.
[Adira coughing]

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.472
- We're free.
- Nearly, my dear.

will meet you

01:04:38.008 --> 01:04:39.609
At his church in Elmira.

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:41.178
Here are your instructions.

Thank you, Mrs. Davenport.

Here, Vanessa.
I wore it as Portia.

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:50.220
- It's yours.
- Keep it hidden, my dear.

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:54.524
Now, you'd better hurry.
There's quite a tempest brewing
[Thunder rumbling]

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:56.593
And we have to bury our dead.

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:57.928
Thank you, sir.

01:04:57.962 --> 01:04:59.529
Reverend Douglass
will see you through.

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:01.966
Get up! Go on.

Captain! Trimmers on the
port side have been ripped off!

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:23.587
Release the slaves, Davey,
else they all drown.

01:05:25.089 --> 01:05:27.324
If this will not do it,
Lord have mercy on us.

[Men shouting indistinctly]

(Newton narrating)
Freedom for all is the hope
of love and forgiveness.

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:45.442
Stand and face this truth, and
your heart will find its voice.

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:49.079
[Shouting intensifies]

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:51.181

who doubted you.

Captain Newton
was reborn that night.

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:34.358
Captain, let's get him
below deck!

01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:38.095
Okay. Get any clothing,
blankets, whatever you can find.

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:39.763
Make sure all needs are filled.

01:06:39.796 --> 01:06:41.765

Did we make it through?

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:20.204
Yes, we did, Ozias.

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:25.642
God protected us.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.080
Yes.

01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:36.453
Yes, He did.

[Short wheezing breaths]

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:42.759
I remember our time together

Day after day working
for that monster Clowe

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:49.266
Starved and shackled.

01:07:50.867 --> 01:07:53.303
I lost all hope.

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:57.374
Not you.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:01.278
You live with strength
and determination.

01:08:06.383 --> 01:08:09.853
I owe you my life, Ozias.

01:08:12.356 --> 01:08:13.657
How can I repay you?

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.528
I am a man.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.667
Am I not your brother?

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:27.737

I..., I want you to have these.

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:46.283
The Bible belonged
to your great grandfather

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:48.885
A gift from Mr. Newton himself.

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:53.890
Read the Bible.

Over my dead body, Clem.

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:17.607
They'll be meeting up with
Douglass at his church in town.

01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:20.444
Why'd you quit?

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:23.580
I heard you caught a free black
man and killed him by mistake.

Whatever you say, Willie.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:28.585
I think all coloreds
should be slaves...

Any man who thinks otherwise
is a damn fool.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:40.364
This is just a great big game
for you, innit boy?

01:11:40.397 --> 01:11:41.798

That's it, old man! There's
the Plimpton from the stories.

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:52.709
Not the slave sympathizer

Hey, Samuel, we're so close.
Have faith.

run us down, Nessa.

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:48.832
No.

No, death saved her
from where we're going.

Sammy, stop, please stop!
Not here! Not now.

01:12:54.438 --> 01:12:57.907
Why? Why God chose us
to be half human?

01:12:57.941 --> 01:13:00.677
To be strung up whenever
they want? Huh?

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.846
To work all our lives
and to die?

01:13:04.013 --> 01:13:07.651
No. This church, this church,
this church means nothing!

Do thee love her, comfort her

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:04.567
Honor and keep her
in sickness and in health

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:08.838
So long as you both shall live?

01:20:09.238 --> 01:20:10.273
I do.

01:20:20.984 --> 01:20:22.151
You all know me.

01:20:24.888 --> 01:20:28.124
But I'm not the same man who
left Rochester ten months ago.

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:32.962
That John Newton
was dramatically changed

01:20:32.996 --> 01:20:36.832
One night in a storm
on the Atlantic ocean.

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:42.238
(Newton)
In utter despair I cried out
and was given another chance.

01:20:47.143 --> 01:20:49.145
Take away a toy from a child

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:51.347
And give him another

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.416
And he is satisfied.

01:20:55.284 --> 01:20:57.853
But if he be hungry,
no toy will do.

01:20:59.956 --> 01:21:02.625
Thus, as newborn babes

01:21:03.392 --> 01:21:06.229
True believers desire
the sincere milk of the word.

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:10.566
And the desire of grace
in this way

01:21:12.035 --> 01:21:13.469
Is grace.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:20.043
* Amazing Grace

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:25.214
* How sweet the sound

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:33.122
* That saved a wretch like me

01:21:35.358 --> 01:21:38.194
* I once was lost

01:21:39.462 --> 01:21:42.598
* But now am found

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:46.269
* Was blind

01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:49.538
* But now I see

01:21:52.308 --> 01:21:56.279
[Gentle background music]

01:21:56.312 --> 01:21:59.983
[Hooves pattering]
[Carriage rattling]

01:22:07.056 --> 01:22:09.558
(Jim)
Look, pa!
I can see the crossing.

01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:14.063
[Water lapping]

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:24.240
Hey!

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:33.482
Go on, Samuel.
Get Jim across, I'll wait here.

01:22:34.317 --> 01:22:36.585
Come on, boy. Let's go.

01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:38.254
We're free, son!

01:22:41.224 --> 01:22:42.525
We're free!

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:49.365
Got you, boy.

01:22:56.772 --> 01:22:58.074
[Vanessa yells]
Hey, boy!

01:23:00.076 --> 01:23:01.244
Come on back now, boy.

01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:02.711
Nessa!

01:23:02.745 --> 01:23:04.380
(Willie)
Don't make me do
something stupid.

01:23:05.381 --> 01:23:06.682
Come on!

01:23:09.552 --> 01:23:10.486
Willie!

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.090
Clem, are you with me?
We'll split Monroe's money.

01:23:14.123 --> 01:23:16.659
They're mine.
No more killing, I mean it.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:19.595
Monroe told me dead
or alive, old man.

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:22.398
Clem, you're just gonna
stand there?

01:23:22.431 --> 01:23:23.732
You best get outta here, Clem.

01:23:25.701 --> 01:23:27.403
I ain't gonna ask again.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:29.672
[Gun clicking]

01:23:32.175 --> 01:23:34.077
So you're just gonna shoot
Monroe's daughter, huh?

01:23:35.378 --> 01:23:37.246
I'm all yours, Mr. Plimpton!

01:23:37.646 --> 01:23:39.482
Shut your mouth, slave boy.
No deals!

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:40.716
Tell him not to do it,
Mr. Plimpton.

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:44.753
Shut your mouth, nigger!
[Gunshots firing]

01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:46.422
(Samuel)
Nessa!

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.292
- Samuel!
- Come over here.

01:23:49.492 --> 01:23:50.693
Come on.

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:08.177
[Plimpton panting]

01:24:08.211 --> 01:24:09.778
Why, Mr Plimpton?

01:24:12.715 --> 01:24:14.283
I've had enough.

01:24:15.684 --> 01:24:17.353
(Plimpton)
No more killing.

01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:20.723
[Plimpton grunts]

01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:25.194
Monroe gave me this
to bring you in.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.363
Take it.

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:35.204
Make a life for her
and your son.

01:24:38.174 --> 01:24:40.176
It's a little gift
from his grandfather.

01:24:41.644 --> 01:24:43.212
Huh?

01:24:44.713 --> 01:24:47.150
[Heavy breathing]

01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:49.485
You're free now, Samuel.

01:25:05.468 --> 01:25:07.636
[Soft pattering]

01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:25.354
(Adira narrating)
How sweet the sound...

01:25:25.388 --> 01:25:28.524
[Soft background music]

01:25:53.416 --> 01:25:58.153
* Amazing Grace

01:25:58.554 --> 01:26:01.890
* How sweet the sound

01:26:03.559 --> 01:26:09.532
* That saved a wretch like me

01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:17.673
* I once was lost
[Voice breaking]

01:26:19.275 --> 01:26:22.711
* But now am found

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:29.485
* Was blind
But now I... *

Amazing Grace]
