WEBVTT

00:45.255 --> 00:46.548
Come on, come on!

00:47.340 --> 00:51.511
Come on, move it, let's go!
Let's go, men. Quick!

01:43.063 --> 01:44.647
ACTIVITY...

01:44.647 --> 01:45.815
Can you see anything?

01:45.815 --> 01:47.108
ACTIVITY NOT DETECTED

01:47.108 --> 01:48.318
Not a thing.

01:50.403 --> 01:51.905
What is the alert for?

01:54.532 --> 01:56.117
We'll find out...

01:56.367 --> 02:00.663
Channel 1 is common, channel 2
is for officers, channel 3 is for Command.

02:00.872 --> 02:02.373
Report to the common channel.

02:02.373 --> 02:03.416
Roger that.

02:03.416 --> 02:07.504
You have multiple hostiles
3 km away and closing.

02:07.754 --> 02:08.670
Details?

02:08.922 --> 02:13.051
They have a heat signature,
and they're moving at 20 km/h.

02:13.510 --> 02:15.595
They're much bigger than a person.

02:15.804 --> 02:17.305
What the hell are they?

02:17.514 --> 02:21.142
They're the enemy, soldier.
What do you do with the enemy?

02:21.601 --> 02:22.936
I kill them, Major.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.187
Exactly.

02:24.479 --> 02:25.855
So get ready.

02:26.231 --> 02:27.482
Yes, sir.

03:07.856 --> 03:09.983
So what do you really do for a living?

03:10.358 --> 03:11.568
I told you.

03:12.318 --> 03:13.403
Oh, come on.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.114
Seriously.

03:16.614 --> 03:17.657
OK.

03:18.825 --> 03:21.327
- You voluntarily enlisted?
- I am.

03:21.578 --> 03:25.248
Come on, our military has gotten better,
but not that much better.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.418
Also, what are you doing in Moscow then?

03:28.668 --> 03:31.171
You're hanging out, picking up girls.

03:32.839 --> 03:35.717
I'm on leave for two weeks,
I've been in for a year.

03:37.760 --> 03:38.845
And?

03:40.430 --> 03:42.515
Don't be confused by the fancy restaurant.

03:43.099 --> 03:45.602
I can afford it, my family is rich...

03:46.519 --> 03:48.438
My father has his own plant
in Samara.

03:48.855 --> 03:52.609
He served for 15 years,
then started his own business.

03:52.859 --> 03:55.778
Also, my brother was special forces.
He was in Syria.

03:56.196 --> 03:59.365
So, you decided to honor
the family legacy.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.910
Well, you could say that.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.579
Where did you serve?

04:05.121 --> 04:07.790
The 45th Special Forces Airborne Brigade.

04:07.999 --> 04:09.876
Oh? Airborne?

04:10.793 --> 04:12.295
So, did you go parachuting?

04:12.503 --> 04:13.838
Of course. It's airborne.

04:16.925 --> 04:18.259
Tough guy, huh?

04:55.672 --> 04:56.631
Cool!

05:28.037 --> 05:30.039
Ladies and gentlemen,
our airplane is descending

05:30.290 --> 05:32.834
We'll arrive to the airport in 18 minutes

05:34.377 --> 05:36.254
Please return to your seats and get ready for landing

05:36.254 --> 05:38.047
Put your seat back in the upright position

05:38.047 --> 05:39.924
fold up your meal tray, open your window blind

05:39.924 --> 05:43.303
lower the armrests of your seat
and fasten your seatbelt

06:31.893 --> 06:33.019
What is that?

06:34.270 --> 06:36.689
I don't know,
but I think it's something serious.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.902
We interrupt your regularly
scheduled TV program

06:41.152 --> 06:44.155
to bring you this
emergency bulletin.

06:44.655 --> 06:49.744
We've lost contact with the majority
of Russia's most populated areas.

06:50.286 --> 06:54.957
So far, EMERCOM centers haven't reported
any natural disasters.

06:56.042 --> 06:58.086
God, Oleg, she's so scared.

06:58.294 --> 06:59.587
...for nuclear attacks...

06:59.837 --> 07:02.965
- Did they say "nuclear attacks"?
- Maybe it's a war?

07:02.965 --> 07:04.384
What?

07:04.384 --> 07:07.428
...are today's events just
a series of accidents

07:08.054 --> 07:10.390
or is this the result of an attack?

07:11.599 --> 07:13.559
Some experts assume

07:13.810 --> 07:16.979
that terrorists may be responsible
for these events.

07:17.188 --> 07:20.650
Government authorities ask you
to remain calm.

07:20.942 --> 07:22.068
I'm calling my father...

07:22.276 --> 07:24.320
...Do not give in to provocations.

07:25.113 --> 07:26.656
We've just...

07:27.949 --> 07:29.992
received a message...

07:31.202 --> 07:35.790
It's not just Russian cities,

07:36.833 --> 07:39.836
we've lost
contact with the rest of the world.

07:40.044 --> 07:44.465
There's no response from phones,
telegraphs, radios, or Internet sites.

07:45.425 --> 07:47.802
Stay tuned, we're trying to learn more.

07:54.225 --> 07:58.312
Base, this is Bro-1, ETA 4 minutes.

07:59.772 --> 08:02.275
This is a quick recon mission.

08:02.608 --> 08:07.238
Our target is a large town
that we recently lost contact with.

08:07.738 --> 08:11.075
We've sent drones there,
none of them have returned.

08:11.576 --> 08:12.660
Kolya!

08:13.202 --> 08:16.289
The first thing you do
is check radiation levels.

08:16.747 --> 08:17.999
Yes, sir.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.168
Alright. Press!

08:26.674 --> 08:27.925
Miss?

08:28.468 --> 08:31.637
Don't go anywhere,
always remain behind the soldiers.

08:31.846 --> 08:34.056
Try to keep your head down.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.308
Don't make any noise, don't talk.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.437
Major, we're almost there.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.152
I can't see anything, there's no light.

08:46.861 --> 08:48.613
There's a line, I see a highway.

08:54.702 --> 08:58.039
It's like it's been cut off.
It's starting. What do they call it?

08:58.331 --> 08:59.499
Quarantine.

09:00.166 --> 09:03.878
This entire thrust line
has been sealed off like a closed border.

09:04.128 --> 09:06.839
We're right over the town.
We're landing.

09:36.077 --> 09:39.163
Bro-1, this is Orlan-1.
Can you hear me? Over.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.458
This is Bro-1, we hear you. Over.

09:47.088 --> 09:49.090
We're moving in. Cover us.

09:49.090 --> 09:50.841
Copy that. Over and out.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.576
She's been dead for a few hours.

11:00.161 --> 11:01.662
How did they all die?

11:04.206 --> 11:05.082
Let's move out.

11:06.459 --> 11:08.336
Let's search that building.

11:11.756 --> 11:15.593
Bro-1, this is Orlan-1.
We'll search the building and come back.

11:15.593 --> 11:17.720
Get ready to pick us up in 30 minutes.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.848
Orlan-1, copy that. The street is clear.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.251
Look...

11:49.835 --> 11:51.420
dinner is on the table.

11:53.255 --> 11:56.717
You see, it happened suddenly,
it caught people off guard.

11:56.967 --> 12:01.430
This family was about to have dinner,
the cashier, the customers in the aisles,

12:01.430 --> 12:03.224
the drivers behind the wheels.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.309
Where are they then?

12:05.601 --> 12:06.811
Where's who?

12:07.186 --> 12:09.980
You said the family was about
to have dinner.

12:10.398 --> 12:11.607
Where are they?

12:39.927 --> 12:41.345
He took my rifle.

12:46.434 --> 12:47.810
Fire! Everybody, fire!

13:04.452 --> 13:05.870
Hold your fire!

13:06.829 --> 13:09.457
I don't get it, we had to have hit him.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.292
I was shooting right at him.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.877
Who was that?

13:13.419 --> 13:15.963
Who the hell knows?
It's just a silhouette.

13:17.882 --> 13:19.008
Was it human?

13:19.175 --> 13:20.259
Yes.

13:20.551 --> 13:25.139
Kolya got lucky, the vest caught
all the bullets. All his ribs are broken.

13:25.514 --> 13:28.184
We need to carry him.
The chopper is on its way.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.602
Let's bug out.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.948
Don't worry, Kolyan, it'll be alright.

13:43.282 --> 13:45.785
What matters is it didn't
get through the vest.

13:45.785 --> 13:46.660
You'll be fine.

13:47.328 --> 13:49.205
Hey! Did you see the shooter?

13:49.538 --> 13:50.581
No.

13:51.207 --> 13:52.750
He came out of nowhere.

13:53.459 --> 13:56.837
He took my rifle and blinded me
with a light. I couldn't see anything.

13:57.046 --> 13:59.298
He just started shooting.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.760
Major, I have HQ on the line.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.430
HQ, come in.

14:06.430 --> 14:09.225
This is Major Dolmatov,
the CO of Recon Team 7.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.768
We're RTB.

14:11.769 --> 14:14.230
There were no survivors
among the civilians.

14:14.855 --> 14:19.235
We encountered an unidentified hostile
in the quarantine zone.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.038
MONTH OF THE UNKNOWN

14:31.038 --> 14:34.250
It's been almost a month
since we've lost all contact

14:34.416 --> 14:36.085
with the quarantine zone.

14:36.293 --> 14:39.338
Over 100,000,000 Russian citizens
are considered missing.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.507
This information hasn't been confirmed.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.969
Meanwhile, the authorities advise
all citizens to remain calm.

14:44.969 --> 14:48.639
There are no plans to expand
the quarantine zone at this time.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.851
However, the authorities' appeals
have been ignored

14:51.851 --> 14:53.519
by some people of faith.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.730
Thousands of Muslims have gathered
on Red Square today

14:56.939 --> 14:59.441
in anticipation of the upcoming
"end of the world."

14:59.441 --> 15:02.069
Christian Orthodox followers
gather in churches.

15:02.278 --> 15:04.947
A cross procession took place
on New Arbat today.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.867
Due to this occurrence,
the capital's authorities

15:07.867 --> 15:11.620
advise you not to give in to panic
and remain calm...

15:25.217 --> 15:27.761
ORDER TO REPORT FOR INDUCTION INTO
THE ARMED FORCES OF THE RF

15:27.761 --> 15:29.722
Yura, what are they saying?

15:30.598 --> 15:32.016
Nothing, Mom.

15:33.309 --> 15:35.603
Everything's fine, life goes on.

15:36.395 --> 15:37.897
Where's my lipstick?

15:41.817 --> 15:43.277
Help me get ready.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.864
- Where are you going?
- To the store.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.783
Dad will be home soon,
and we have no food.

15:54.413 --> 15:56.582
There's no need, Mom, I already bought it.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.251
The fridge is stocked.

16:07.176 --> 16:08.260
Take this.

16:08.844 --> 16:09.845
What's this?

16:10.137 --> 16:11.430
Your pills, Mom.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.307
What pills?

16:13.307 --> 16:15.184
Mom, you take these every day.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.710
Call your father.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.050
Tell him to be home on time.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.929
Mom, Dad died three years ago.

16:54.264 --> 16:57.476
I'm off to work, will be back late.
If anything, call Sveta.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.145
Sveta lives next door. Remember her?

17:02.773 --> 17:06.777
I asked him this morning,
"When will you be back?"

17:10.739 --> 17:12.782
Alright, take care.

17:54.408 --> 17:58.162
Your dreams... dreams... dreams...

17:58.162 --> 17:59.621
...is our reality...

18:01.290 --> 18:05.002
Virtual Love Chamber is waiting for you.
At your disposal there are more than 1000...

18:14.094 --> 18:15.721
Hold it, kid!

18:23.228 --> 18:24.772
Welcome...

18:28.275 --> 18:33.947
WE ARE ALREADY DEAD

18:45.000 --> 18:49.046
McLuck-8, good morning, this is Dagger-4,
we're approaching the perimeter.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.756
Permission to land? Over.

18:51.799 --> 18:54.510
Dagger-4, permission granted, pad 2.

18:55.344 --> 18:57.429
Copy that. Landing.

18:57.596 --> 19:00.599
And a good morning
won't begin for another 2 hours...

19:50.315 --> 19:51.441
Attention!

19:59.867 --> 20:01.160
At ease, soldiers.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.705
Let me introduce myself,
Lt. Colonel Osmolovskaya.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.000
Main Intelligence Directorate.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.086
I apologize if I came at a bad time.

20:11.295 --> 20:12.921
Hope everyone put their pants on.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.298
And what if we didn't?

20:14.464 --> 20:16.550
Then you'll listen with a bare ass.

20:19.887 --> 20:23.307
As we all know, something
happened 24 days ago,

20:23.724 --> 20:26.435
and all contact was lost
with most of the world.

20:26.768 --> 20:30.397
The entire quarantine zone
is suddenly in a total blackout.

20:30.606 --> 20:33.942
Everything outside this circle
is in complete darkness.

20:34.902 --> 20:37.154
The majority of this Circle of Life

20:37.404 --> 20:42.367
is in Russia, most of Finland,
Estonia, Latvia,

20:42.784 --> 20:44.328
Belarus and Ukraine.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.498
Recon teams sent out along
the inner edge of the quarantine

20:48.665 --> 20:52.502
reported similar situations
in all the populated areas.

20:53.629 --> 20:57.716
Dead civilians and several contacts
with an unidentified hostile.

20:58.175 --> 21:00.677
One of the teams brought some bodies back.

21:00.928 --> 21:06.058
Autopsies showed that the COD was
poisoning with endogenous neurotoxins,

21:07.684 --> 21:09.811
as in, chemicals produced
by the human body.

21:09.978 --> 21:13.482
Are you trying to say that all the bodies
within this "Circle of Life"

21:13.482 --> 21:15.525
just went ahead and poisoned themselves?

21:15.817 --> 21:17.236
Not me, the facts.

21:17.986 --> 21:21.448
Our primary objective
is to collect all the necessary data

21:21.448 --> 21:25.035
for the scientists, so they can determine
the nature of these events.

21:25.786 --> 21:30.249
Our secondary objective is to move deeper
into the quarantine zone.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.835
The country's resources
are extremely limited.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.754
We need to get our territory back.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.965
However, we have to be very careful,

21:38.257 --> 21:39.424
because...

21:41.301 --> 21:43.303
there is more bad news.

21:44.763 --> 21:47.849
Five recon teams that were deployed
deep into the quarantine zone

21:48.058 --> 21:49.184
are MIA.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.186
I think many of you know this.

21:51.436 --> 21:55.357
I heard from the guys
a few teams have vanished.

21:56.900 --> 22:00.529
But I doubt you heard that
an entire company of tanks was sent

22:00.529 --> 22:03.865
toward the Kirov Region on the first day.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.911
An entire company...

22:08.704 --> 22:10.455
...along with 70 tanks...

22:14.334 --> 22:15.752
All contact was lost.

22:20.507 --> 22:23.302
This outpost is situated
at the very edge.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.638
The recon teams that leave from here
do come back.

22:27.097 --> 22:30.017
Everyone who's gone deeper in
hasn't returned.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.103
We need to figure out why.

22:42.029 --> 22:44.364
EMERCOM is taking forever again.

22:44.698 --> 22:47.075
I think we got a medical supply delivery.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.997
I don't like these woods.

22:53.248 --> 22:56.251
It feels like someone
is always watching us from there.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.628
Too bad we don't have a flamethrower.

22:58.837 --> 23:02.841
Hello, soldiers!
Looks like you're good with medicine now.

23:02.841 --> 23:06.094
We brought you a doctor, too.
Where can we settle in?

23:11.600 --> 23:12.684
Alyona?

23:12.893 --> 23:14.311
Do you know her?

23:16.897 --> 23:18.982
Take cover!

23:37.376 --> 23:41.254
HQ, channel 1 is common, channel 2
is for officers, channel 3 is for Command.

23:41.463 --> 23:42.589
Report to channel 1.

23:42.964 --> 23:43.840
Roger that.

23:44.091 --> 23:48.845
You have multiple hostiles
3 km away and closing.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.639
Details?

23:50.847 --> 23:55.018
They have a heat signature,
and they're moving at 20 km/h.

23:55.394 --> 23:57.479
They're much bigger than a person.

23:59.481 --> 24:00.857
Attention!

24:00.857 --> 24:03.860
Strong electromagnetic radiation
has been detected.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.954
Everybody, hold your positions!

24:16.748 --> 24:18.250
Don't move!

24:33.223 --> 24:34.891
Targets are closing in.

24:35.183 --> 24:36.810
Major, they're headed toward you.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.231
500 meters.

24:41.481 --> 24:42.607
Ready!

24:50.073 --> 24:51.116
300 meters.

24:58.457 --> 24:59.416
150 meters.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.094
Fire!

26:06.233 --> 26:08.527
At 5 a.m. this morning,

26:09.194 --> 26:13.490
a military outpost
in the Kirov region was attacked.

26:13.782 --> 26:20.830
The attack wasn't carried out
by a group of people, but rather a...

26:21.206 --> 26:22.874
Men, we have another one!

26:23.208 --> 26:26.711
...it's hard to believe, but these facts
speak for themselves...

26:27.003 --> 26:28.088
Check this out!

26:36.012 --> 26:37.681
...there are casualties...

26:39.975 --> 26:41.184
Come on.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.620
And, up.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.208
How are you, brother?

27:05.875 --> 27:07.752
I thought we'd lost you there.

27:45.248 --> 27:49.878
Damn, it's really you.
I thought I'd dreamt it when I was out.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.341
It's a small world, especially now.

27:58.094 --> 28:02.140
I'd never think you were a doctor.
You didn't tell me then.

28:02.140 --> 28:08.229
I didn't want to ruin a great night.
Guys like to think girls are vulnerable.

28:08.855 --> 28:13.818
Alright, no hairline fractures, which is great.

28:14.611 --> 28:17.530
This looks good, too.

28:24.954 --> 28:26.289
Does this hurt?

28:26.539 --> 28:27.874
Nope.

28:40.345 --> 28:41.680
Sorry.

28:42.389 --> 28:45.725
I know it hurts, but I had to examine it.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.439
Watch your head.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.486
Joint injury and a hematoma.

28:57.195 --> 28:59.114
So, you're the Chief of Medicine at the base?

28:59.114 --> 29:03.368
Not even close. The chief is from Burdenko.

29:03.660 --> 29:06.538
He spent the morning dissecting a bear.

29:06.538 --> 29:09.040
I can't wait for them to remove it from here.

29:10.625 --> 29:11.918
It's pretty insane.

29:12.168 --> 29:13.461
Tell me about it.

29:13.753 --> 29:19.134
You're on bed rest now,
you'll be back in the barrack soon.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.762
I might drop by tonight...

29:22.762 --> 29:24.931
for a visit.

29:31.354 --> 29:35.150
How could hundreds of bears
deliberately attack the outpost?

29:35.483 --> 29:38.486
I know someone who could help us
get to the bottom of this.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.280
I'd like to meet that person.

29:41.072 --> 29:43.658
Have you heard about the Sensors?

29:44.534 --> 29:46.411
Are you talking about the people

29:47.245 --> 29:50.832
who supposedly got superpowers
after the primary events?

29:51.583 --> 29:53.209
The Sensors do exist.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.255
I actually studied them.

29:57.505 --> 30:01.426
They don't bend spoons or move glasses,
they're not superheroes.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.053
But, they know something we don't.

30:04.679 --> 30:08.433
Their minds receive data
like radios receive signals.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.648
However, we can't decipher the data.

30:15.648 --> 30:18.193
We don't know how they became this way,
either.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.737
I've selected the strongest one,

30:21.154 --> 30:23.323
but he was hurt during the primary event.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.367
He's in a military hospital right now.

30:27.577 --> 30:30.330
His abilities could be useful to us.

30:45.929 --> 30:47.055
Who are you?

30:47.889 --> 30:49.265
I'm Zhenya.

30:49.682 --> 30:50.892
I was sent by Id.

30:51.184 --> 30:52.101
Who is that?

30:52.310 --> 30:54.813
You can ask questions later.
Listen carefully.

30:55.188 --> 30:57.857
The first wave destroyed all electronics.

30:58.274 --> 31:02.195
The second launched the self-destruction
of all biological organisms.

31:02.403 --> 31:03.822
The third wave...

31:04.447 --> 31:07.450
will make anyone still alive in
the quarantine zone attack us.

31:07.659 --> 31:09.369
But, that hasn't happened yet.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.496
We have time to stop it from happening.

31:11.496 --> 31:12.872
What do you mean?

31:14.415 --> 31:16.125
Who's out there?

31:16.626 --> 31:18.628
There are 160 million of them.

31:20.588 --> 31:21.631
People?

31:21.840 --> 31:23.258
Not exactly.

31:24.425 --> 31:26.094
Their free will is gone.

31:26.469 --> 31:30.098
And it'll never come back,
which makes them more dangerous.

31:30.265 --> 31:32.267
However, Id knows how to stop them.

31:34.018 --> 31:35.603
And you will help him.

31:36.604 --> 31:38.940
You'll help find the one
who controls them.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.609
You must have seen him.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.281
I don't want to.

31:47.574 --> 31:48.908
I don't want this.

31:49.826 --> 31:50.952
Leave.

31:52.161 --> 31:53.538
Get out of here!

31:53.788 --> 31:55.707
Somebody, get him out of here!

31:56.583 --> 31:58.001
Are you alright?

31:58.710 --> 32:00.712
Arrest him. How did he get in here?

32:00.879 --> 32:02.839
Why did you let him in?

32:03.339 --> 32:04.549
Who?

32:07.760 --> 32:09.304
This guy.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.599
He's right here! Are you messing with me?

32:15.977 --> 32:17.145
I'll get the doctor.

32:18.062 --> 32:19.564
What's happening?

32:19.856 --> 32:21.983
What the hell is happening?

32:22.567 --> 32:25.737
Captain, but there's no one else in here
but us.

32:27.572 --> 32:29.699
I didn't need to get inside the hospital.

32:29.699 --> 32:32.243
All I had to do was get in there.

32:40.084 --> 32:41.628
I think he's hallucinating.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.255
He says someone else is in the room.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.142
I feel like I'm hallucinating.

32:56.684 --> 32:58.603
You're lucky you passed out.

33:00.063 --> 33:01.397
It was ugly out there.

33:02.857 --> 33:04.442
They aren't easy to kill.

33:04.651 --> 33:05.610
No shit.

33:05.902 --> 33:08.446
And we have no clue
who's in the quarantine zone.

33:10.281 --> 33:12.742
It wasn't a bear that took Kolya's gun.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.160
That's true.

33:16.829 --> 33:17.956
How is your mom?

33:18.122 --> 33:19.290
She's not answering.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.336
I asked a neighbor to check in on her.

33:23.878 --> 33:25.755
She says my mom's fine.

33:28.466 --> 33:30.009
How is your family? Alive?

33:32.595 --> 33:34.180
They stayed in Samara.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.641
My parents...

33:39.143 --> 33:41.270
I had a bad fight with Mom then.

33:41.646 --> 33:44.482
She didn't want me to go,
she always hated the military.

33:44.649 --> 33:45.775
How come?

33:46.567 --> 33:48.194
My brother died in Syria.

33:48.778 --> 33:50.947
Dad always compared me to him.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.616
He raised him, and I'm the mamma's boy.

33:54.534 --> 33:56.327
So, I decided to prove him wrong...

33:57.245 --> 33:58.663
and went to serve, too.

33:59.372 --> 34:02.709
Mom couldn't accept my brother's death,
and there I was...

34:04.002 --> 34:06.254
When it all began a month and a half ago,

34:06.254 --> 34:08.922
I tried calling them, but it was too late.

34:11.009 --> 34:12.719
We never spoke again.

34:15.263 --> 34:17.974
How are you feeling, Sergeant?

34:19.559 --> 34:22.020
A combat medic, huh?
Who could've thought?

34:22.353 --> 34:23.688
Was that a compliment?

34:24.188 --> 34:25.565
You tell me.

34:26.774 --> 34:28.985
I need to change your friend's dressing.

34:29.193 --> 34:31.904
It won't look pretty. Will you excuse us?

34:35.992 --> 34:37.659
Alright, that sounds serious.

34:46.502 --> 34:47.670
How are you?

34:47.962 --> 34:48.463
I'm fine.

34:49.547 --> 34:52.257
I signed your 3-day leave pass for Moscow.

34:52.257 --> 34:55.053
You'll see a physical therapist
for three days

34:55.053 --> 34:56.429
and be as good as new.

34:57.221 --> 34:59.932
Prepare to move out.

35:00.683 --> 35:02.894
Everyone, get in position.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.439
Let's do it.

35:07.231 --> 35:08.733
Raven-1 is ready.

35:09.192 --> 35:10.526
Raven-2 is ready.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.445
Raven-3 is ready.

35:12.737 --> 35:14.113
Vulture-1 is ready.

35:14.572 --> 35:15.698
Vulture-2 is ready.

35:17.825 --> 35:19.285
Bustard-1 is ready.

35:19.786 --> 35:20.870
Bustard-2 is ready.

35:22.622 --> 35:23.706
Hello, boys.

35:24.082 --> 35:25.291
Good evening, ma'am.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.710
Say hello to Moscow for me.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.505
Have a good time for me.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.632
Not with my leg!

36:13.422 --> 36:15.133
I don't know what to say.

36:15.758 --> 36:16.968
Why am I here?

36:17.218 --> 36:18.427
Yes.

36:19.095 --> 36:21.222
Because it's my military duty.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.266
I want to help, to be a part of this.

36:23.641 --> 36:27.854
Do you have any rage?
Any desire to get revenge?

36:28.771 --> 36:30.481
So many people have died.

36:30.773 --> 36:33.860
Most of the population is gone,
we've all lost someone.

36:35.570 --> 36:36.779
I didn't have anyone.

36:38.406 --> 36:39.991
Well, except for my mother.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.910
She's in Moscow, alive.

36:45.246 --> 36:46.956
What did you do before all this?

36:47.206 --> 36:48.499
I worked.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.126
I drove a cab.

36:50.501 --> 36:51.627
Seriously?

36:54.547 --> 36:56.007
Can you turn off the camera?

36:57.925 --> 36:59.844
I don't want to say this on camera.

37:00.303 --> 37:02.471
I have a different opinion
about all this.

37:02.722 --> 37:04.265
I don't want to lie to people.

37:04.891 --> 37:07.602
Well, can you tell me? I want to know.

37:11.105 --> 37:13.649
Perhaps I don't mind that this happened.

37:15.359 --> 37:17.737
In my case, it gave my life meaning.

37:18.362 --> 37:21.741
I was nobody as a civilian,
and here, I make a difference.

37:23.451 --> 37:25.578
Don't you feel sorry for the people?

37:25.828 --> 37:27.538
No, I don't know them.

37:30.833 --> 37:33.961
I bet you don't care, either,
unless your loved ones got hurt.

37:33.961 --> 37:36.297
Only 0.5% of the population survived.

37:36.756 --> 37:39.759
That means that for every survivor,
there are 1,000 dead.

37:40.259 --> 37:43.221
I'm 1 out of 1,000, you're 1 out of 1,000.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.807
Just like everyone else in this vehicle.

37:47.016 --> 37:49.310
I think it's pretty awesome. Isn't it?

38:28.641 --> 38:32.103
There's total devastation ahead,
the convoy cannot move further.

38:32.645 --> 38:36.190
I see destroyed tanks,
one's turret was blown off.

38:41.737 --> 38:44.073
The third wave has already begun.

38:56.919 --> 39:00.423
The recent footage
from the destroyed tank unit,

39:00.589 --> 39:03.175
which was sent out to study
the quarantine zone,

39:03.384 --> 39:05.970
shocked the public
and led to a new wave of panic.

39:08.848 --> 39:11.475
Even though there are no signs
of enemy presence

39:11.684 --> 39:13.519
or any direct impact...

39:13.728 --> 39:15.730
...many experts believe...

39:15.980 --> 39:18.316
...we're currently in a state of war.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.902
The armored unit
was destroyed by weapons,

39:22.153 --> 39:24.572
and clearly, someone controlled
those weapons.

39:24.739 --> 39:26.574
Therefore, we have an enemy.

39:26.907 --> 39:31.495
Frankly, this is a new form of warfare
that hasn't been used before.

39:32.038 --> 39:33.122
That's even scarier.

39:33.331 --> 39:36.834
There's a chance the government is hiding
who we're really fighting.

39:37.043 --> 39:41.547
The only possible result of this
is panic and total chaos.

39:44.884 --> 39:49.055
Truly, things aren't easy for those
who've survived.

39:49.305 --> 39:53.434
People don't know what to expect,
many stopped going to work.

39:53.601 --> 39:56.103
I don't think it was this bad
even in the 90s.

39:56.395 --> 39:59.523
I can't go outside
without fear of being robbed.

40:02.234 --> 40:06.113
The authorities say nothing,
they just keep sending more soldiers.

40:07.573 --> 40:10.951
Why won't they tell us the truth?
We have the right to know.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.537
We're people and we're terrified.

40:16.499 --> 40:19.085
Crime rates in the cities have gone up.

40:20.044 --> 40:22.463
There have been more reports
of store robberies.

40:22.630 --> 40:24.715
Giving in to the general panic,

40:24.965 --> 40:27.301
people pillage grocery store shelves,

40:27.468 --> 40:31.555
looting huge stockpiles of food,
and stocking up on supplies.

40:36.018 --> 40:38.896
Supreme High Command's
position is that

40:39.188 --> 40:42.191
we're fighting an
unknown group of people.

40:42.525 --> 40:44.610
After all that we've witnessed,

40:45.027 --> 40:49.532
it's safe to assume they use weapons
found in the quarantine zone.

40:49.907 --> 40:52.159
Considering the size of that area,

40:52.785 --> 40:55.246
the number of military bases, and so on,

40:55.538 --> 40:58.958
they have access to nearly every kind
of weapon available.

40:59.166 --> 41:02.753
However, we haven't detected the movement
of any military hardware.

41:02.962 --> 41:06.215
Therefore, we're preparing a series
of special operations.

41:06.215 --> 41:10.386
We must take control of that area and move
deeper into the quarantine zone

41:10.678 --> 41:15.141
to determine the location of the enemy
and their approximate number.

41:15.349 --> 41:18.227
We have small recon teams
who will take on the mission.

41:18.394 --> 41:20.229
In case of contact
with the enemy,

41:20.229 --> 41:23.023
we'll send reinforcements
and deploy additional troops

41:23.023 --> 41:24.442
from our base of operations.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.360
It will not be an easy mission.

41:26.360 --> 41:30.072
They are to secure a foothold
and set up an observation post.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.783
We'll set up communications
and supply lines,

41:32.783 --> 41:35.202
they'll have to live in the zone.

41:35.703 --> 41:38.164
We can no longer sit around and wait.

41:38.747 --> 41:43.794
We must act despite the high risk
of making a mistake.

41:46.297 --> 41:49.508
HQ, this is Traveler-7,
we're 10 km away from the checkpoint.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.927
Copy that, Traveler-7.

41:52.887 --> 41:55.181
What if we run into someone?

41:56.891 --> 41:58.684
Why do you ask?

42:00.102 --> 42:02.104
I want to know what to do.

42:03.772 --> 42:05.566
In your case, scream.

42:07.151 --> 42:08.819
Yeah? And in your case?

42:12.364 --> 42:15.159
Do you want to go back
before we go too far?

42:16.494 --> 42:18.120
Do you want to go back?

42:18.287 --> 42:22.249
Lieutenant, relax, she didn't mean that.
We're all stressed.

42:29.757 --> 42:30.883
It's OK.

42:36.722 --> 42:40.726
Where's your helper guy?
The cameraman?

42:41.101 --> 42:43.521
He went to Moscow to see his family.

42:44.772 --> 42:47.066
I can handle the camera.

42:47.650 --> 42:48.776
Petrov!

42:49.151 --> 42:50.528
Hold this.

42:51.278 --> 42:52.446
Come here.

42:55.491 --> 42:56.867
What about you?

42:57.159 --> 42:59.411
Don't you have a family to go to?

43:00.412 --> 43:02.039
I guess I don't.

43:05.417 --> 43:06.585
Put me down.

43:18.180 --> 43:19.640
This is a small village.

43:20.015 --> 43:23.227
Let's clear every house before we dig in.

43:24.186 --> 43:27.106
Then, we can choose the best location.

43:27.356 --> 43:28.941
Turn on the local channel.

43:32.319 --> 43:35.364
Team 1 takes the left side,
Team 2 takes the right.

44:20.451 --> 44:21.702
What's wrong, Senchuk?

44:27.458 --> 44:30.044
Spread out, keep your eyes open.

44:30.836 --> 44:31.962
Did you see them?

44:31.962 --> 44:36.258
There was no one, I opened the container,
and this shit fell out.

44:36.759 --> 44:37.926
Dammit!

44:38.093 --> 44:39.386
Are you serious?

44:40.137 --> 44:41.764
We need to take it out.

44:42.806 --> 44:44.642
Wait, take it out?

44:44.892 --> 44:46.935
Wait, don't do that!

44:56.737 --> 44:59.615
It's getting dark,
we should continue in the morning.

44:59.948 --> 45:02.368
Let's find a good spot for observation.

45:02.576 --> 45:04.703
Let's move toward that building.

45:05.579 --> 45:07.122
It provides a good view.

45:08.165 --> 45:10.084
Check every door...

45:10.876 --> 45:14.296
if they're unlocked or broken into,
check the apartments.

45:18.258 --> 45:19.551
What are they doing?

45:19.760 --> 45:22.805
It's a tracking radar,
it sees people through walls.

45:23.097 --> 45:24.556
Like in Predator.

45:26.600 --> 45:27.768
Clear.

45:31.563 --> 45:32.731
Where do we go?

45:32.940 --> 45:37.778
Ninth floor, it has roof access, so we can
fast-rope down if we need to bug out.

45:38.070 --> 45:39.279
Clear.

45:43.617 --> 45:46.412
Major, Team 2 is clearing
their location.

45:46.662 --> 45:48.914
Team 4 is in position.

45:49.331 --> 45:50.708
Did they send a doctor?

45:50.958 --> 45:52.501
He's leaving tomorrow.

45:52.793 --> 45:55.713
Team 7 is in Kirov on recon detail.

45:56.547 --> 45:58.632
- Who's the Lieutenant in 7?
- Kasatkin.

45:59.299 --> 46:01.760
- That's the one with the girl.
- Yes, sir.

46:02.553 --> 46:04.346
Keep an eye on them.

46:08.225 --> 46:10.686
Traveler-4, come in.

46:11.645 --> 46:13.230
Traveler-4 here. Over.

46:14.106 --> 46:15.315
We're approaching.

46:15.607 --> 46:16.817
Copy that.

46:36.378 --> 46:37.629
Alyona!

46:38.172 --> 46:39.256
Yes.

46:39.256 --> 46:41.008
- So they sent you?
- Yes. Hi.

46:42.926 --> 46:43.969
Sorry.

46:47.055 --> 46:49.099
- Where is he?
- Inside.

46:55.481 --> 46:57.191
Come, we need help.

47:03.238 --> 47:06.575
You did a good job cleaning the wound,
for a soldier.

47:07.075 --> 47:08.577
Thanks a lot.

47:08.911 --> 47:10.704
I still need to bring him in.

47:11.121 --> 47:12.164
It's deep.

47:12.790 --> 47:15.417
Bring me in? It's not that deep.

47:15.667 --> 47:18.921
Give me some painkillers,
and I'll dance for you.

47:19.213 --> 47:21.131
Don't bring me in, they need me here.

47:24.051 --> 47:26.762
It's your call, you're the boss.

47:31.517 --> 47:32.893
Sorry, man.

47:33.227 --> 47:35.771
If it gets infected,
we'll need to amputate.

47:37.689 --> 47:38.816
Freaking cripples.

47:53.455 --> 47:54.498
Olya.

47:56.667 --> 47:57.876
Get up.

47:59.086 --> 48:00.462
How did you sleep?

48:01.505 --> 48:03.298
Surprisingly well.

48:04.383 --> 48:05.759
Is everything OK?

48:06.009 --> 48:07.094
Yes, it's all quiet.

48:07.344 --> 48:09.304
Sorry, I decided to wake you up.

48:09.972 --> 48:12.099
Your breakfast is getting cold.

48:13.058 --> 48:14.685
What, do we have something hot?

48:16.311 --> 48:18.397
It'll be the best hot breakfast ever.

48:24.027 --> 48:25.070
Hello.

48:29.783 --> 48:31.451
Good morning.

48:32.870 --> 48:34.413
It smells so good.

48:36.498 --> 48:37.791
Have a seat.

48:44.423 --> 48:47.301
It's good. Do you always eat like this
in the Army?

48:48.135 --> 48:49.553
It's just canned beef.

48:53.307 --> 48:55.142
You wouldn't eat this back home.

48:55.350 --> 48:59.855
Here, when you're at death's doorstep,
food tastes different.

49:03.984 --> 49:05.569
Same goes for sex.

49:07.571 --> 49:10.699
I guess I'll take your word on that one.

49:10.991 --> 49:12.576
Listen, Mr. Pickup Guru,

49:12.576 --> 49:14.578
your turn to watch the window.

49:33.597 --> 49:34.640
Olya.

49:36.016 --> 49:38.685
Did you film when we were
approaching the building?

49:39.144 --> 49:40.103
I did. Why?

49:40.771 --> 49:41.772
Let me see.

49:48.528 --> 49:50.697
Which one is from last night?

49:56.161 --> 49:58.622
Look, the door to the store was closed.

50:00.457 --> 50:01.500
Son of a bitch.

50:04.419 --> 50:05.379
Could be the wind.

50:05.629 --> 50:07.673
If the wind closed it, sure...

50:08.048 --> 50:09.800
but not open it.

50:38.870 --> 50:40.998
I'm glad you're feeling better.

50:45.919 --> 50:46.712
Who are you?

50:46.920 --> 50:51.049
Zhenya told you about me.
My name is Id.

50:51.633 --> 50:53.385
I'm hallucinating again.

50:54.094 --> 50:56.179
It's alright, I'm really here.

50:56.722 --> 50:58.765
Zhenya only had a mental connection.

50:59.391 --> 51:01.143
I had connected your minds then.

51:01.518 --> 51:03.603
We don't have much time, Sasha.

51:04.312 --> 51:06.940
You were on the border
during the first wave.

51:07.399 --> 51:10.736
You didn't become a slave,
but you're no longer a regular human.

51:11.194 --> 51:12.279
You're different.

51:12.654 --> 51:15.198
You can find the one who controls them.

51:15.699 --> 51:17.242
You saw him, didn't you?

51:19.286 --> 51:20.287
I did.

51:20.495 --> 51:23.957
I didn't see his face, but I know
who you're talking about.

51:24.124 --> 51:26.043
- It was a dream.
- Where is he?

51:26.209 --> 51:29.212
I don't know. I can't help you.
Do you understand?

51:35.802 --> 51:37.679
You must come with me.

51:42.142 --> 51:43.435
Sasha!

51:46.730 --> 51:48.774
Step away from him!
Sasha, who is that?

51:49.441 --> 51:51.026
We have an intruder!

52:04.623 --> 52:06.541
What do you see?

52:09.419 --> 52:10.921
Clear, no movement.

52:18.762 --> 52:20.472
What are they saying?

52:21.765 --> 52:23.141
Nothing yet.

52:49.251 --> 52:50.710
The building is clear.

52:53.755 --> 52:55.298
Someone was here.

53:00.387 --> 53:02.639
Looks like they come here for the food.

53:05.559 --> 53:06.935
What do you think?

53:07.310 --> 53:10.063
I say we recoup,
can't miss this opportunity.

53:12.065 --> 53:13.650
Set up an ambush.

53:13.942 --> 53:15.026
That's smart.

53:15.318 --> 53:17.028
Do you have your grenade?

53:17.487 --> 53:18.697
Set up traps.

53:19.781 --> 53:21.867
I will not repeat myself.
Step away!

53:29.457 --> 53:31.710
What the hell are you doing?

53:36.882 --> 53:39.509
If he moves, take him down!

53:59.070 --> 54:00.947
I didn't have to resort to that,

54:01.239 --> 54:05.577
but a short demonstration of power
is more effective than a long explanation.

54:06.453 --> 54:09.748
Do you think I could make them
pull the trigger?

54:14.002 --> 54:15.003
That's right.

54:15.587 --> 54:18.006
Millions just like me will be here soon.

54:18.298 --> 54:20.550
They will all want the same thing...

54:20.884 --> 54:22.177
to destroy you.

54:22.886 --> 54:24.387
All of you.

54:25.388 --> 54:26.932
I am on your side.

54:27.724 --> 54:30.602
We don't have much time,
but if you hear me out,

54:30.852 --> 54:32.354
I'll try to convince you.

54:32.604 --> 54:34.397
You're not human. Who are you?

54:35.565 --> 54:38.485
In your language,
I am what you'd call...

54:38.652 --> 54:39.861
a god.

54:40.570 --> 54:42.864
I'm ready to answer all your questions,

54:43.156 --> 54:45.075
but we're running out of time.

54:56.378 --> 54:57.754
Kolya, what do you see?

54:59.214 --> 55:00.340
Nothing.

55:01.174 --> 55:04.719
I don't think we'll see them today
if they already got their food.

55:06.304 --> 55:07.555
How's it going?

55:08.223 --> 55:09.724
It's going.

55:10.558 --> 55:13.061
I don't understand everything
that's happening.

55:13.311 --> 55:15.522
I'm describing our lieutenant for now.

55:17.065 --> 55:18.191
I see.

55:23.655 --> 55:25.156
What about your husband?

55:25.991 --> 55:28.868
Is he worried you're here,
on the front line?

55:30.370 --> 55:32.372
We have a complicated relationship.

55:33.540 --> 55:34.791
How come?

55:36.001 --> 55:39.379
Sometimes, the love is gone,
but people are afraid to break up.

55:40.088 --> 55:42.424
And sometimes, it goes on for too long.

55:44.217 --> 55:45.343
Men.

55:45.802 --> 55:47.095
I see movement.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.058
The trap worked.

55:52.642 --> 55:54.311
We're moving out.

55:56.146 --> 55:58.356
- What about me? I...
- You stay here.

55:58.732 --> 56:02.527
If a firefight breaks out, and we
don't answer on the radio, use this.

56:03.236 --> 56:05.405
There are two signal flares,
purple and red.

56:05.613 --> 56:07.866
Purple means we were attacked
and need help.

56:07.866 --> 56:09.492
- And the red one?
- Red equals dead.

56:09.659 --> 56:11.870
"Team is destroyed, don't expect help."

57:06.383 --> 57:07.592
Here!

57:18.103 --> 57:19.396
Holy shit.

57:20.855 --> 57:22.774
- He's alive.
- Check for fractures.

57:22.982 --> 57:24.109
What's happening?

57:24.442 --> 57:27.779
Teenager, about 14, set off the tripwire,
limbs intact.

57:28.196 --> 57:29.906
What the hell?

57:31.324 --> 57:33.034
Is he alone out here?

57:35.787 --> 57:36.788
Put the camera away.

57:36.955 --> 57:38.873
I said there could be civilians here.

57:39.040 --> 57:40.708
Do you hear me? Put it away!

57:40.959 --> 57:43.002
- I hear you.
- Be quiet.

57:43.378 --> 57:45.505
He looks fine, let's take him.

57:47.674 --> 57:50.468
Are you saying it's all
due to some radiation

57:50.468 --> 57:55.181
that apparently turned 160 million people
into mindless alien puppets?

57:55.432 --> 57:57.058
To put it simply, yes.

57:57.392 --> 58:00.687
I was supposed to give the order
to begin the irradiation process

58:00.895 --> 58:02.689
once the moon is above the ocean.

58:02.856 --> 58:06.943
But, I gave the order when
the moon covered this part of the planet.

58:07.152 --> 58:11.197
The radiation didn't reach it,
that's why the Circle of Life appeared.

58:11.489 --> 58:15.577
Those beyond the circle no longer
have control over their own minds.

58:15.785 --> 58:18.371
They simply follow orders,
like drones.

58:18.830 --> 58:22.917
Soon, they'll gather around the circle
and attack you.

58:23.126 --> 58:25.879
It'll begin the third wave
of colonization.

58:26.212 --> 58:28.089
Why do you need our planet?

58:28.339 --> 58:30.467
Our star was doomed to burn out.

58:30.675 --> 58:32.469
We looked for a new place to live.

58:32.760 --> 58:36.389
Your planet is perfect,
your sun is a relatively young star.

58:36.890 --> 58:39.559
This planet will be habitable
for a long time.

58:39.767 --> 58:42.312
So you want to destroy us?

58:42.854 --> 58:45.440
And that's why you need
the colonization waves.

58:45.648 --> 58:48.443
Actually, there was also...

58:48.943 --> 58:51.112
a wave number zero.

58:51.696 --> 58:54.365
According to our race's
colonization system,

58:54.616 --> 58:57.452
wave zero is a biological attack

58:57.744 --> 59:02.373
that was supposed to subdue the planet
while the ships were on the way.

59:02.624 --> 59:03.708
Who is that?

59:03.875 --> 59:05.126
Cover us.

59:05.335 --> 59:08.630
Our solar system is far away from yours.

59:09.589 --> 59:10.965
I don't understand.

59:11.132 --> 59:15.053
Since our colonization ship is unable
to travel at light speed,

59:15.303 --> 59:21.142
we send a smaller ship with bioweapons
through hyperspace.

59:21.601 --> 59:24.020
It reaches the target almost instantly.

59:24.604 --> 59:27.565
Then, the Armada moves out.

59:28.024 --> 59:31.277
By the time the Armada arrives
in 200,000 years,

59:31.653 --> 59:34.405
the planet is ready for new inhabitants.

59:36.115 --> 59:39.244
So they're only coming in 200,000 years?

59:39.953 --> 59:42.080
No, they arrive tomorrow.

59:48.461 --> 59:49.587
What have we here?

59:49.587 --> 59:52.257
Didn't the recon team say
there was no one out there?

59:53.007 --> 59:55.718
He has barotrauma,
or maybe it's just a concussion.

59:56.928 --> 01:00:00.431
It's not too bad, we can help him,
I'll get the medkit.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.934
Here, drink this. How are you?

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:14.070
What happened?

01:00:14.904 --> 01:00:16.447
What do you remember?

01:00:16.948 --> 01:00:19.826
I went inside the store to get food.

01:00:20.493 --> 01:00:22.745
- I do it almost every night.
- Go on.

01:00:23.037 --> 01:00:25.790
I didn't know anyone else survived.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:29.377
I thought everyone was dead.

01:00:33.089 --> 01:00:34.966
Son of a bitch!

01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:42.056
- Had enough war, did you?
- Fuck off.

01:00:44.017 --> 01:00:45.727
How are the others doing?

01:00:46.436 --> 01:00:48.605
I'm not sure, but I think they're fine.

01:00:54.861 --> 01:00:55.862
Be careful, OK?

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:57.113
You too.

01:01:05.872 --> 01:01:07.665
Movement detected.

01:01:08.124 --> 01:01:11.294
This wave number zero,
the biological attack...

01:01:11.544 --> 01:01:15.173
Did you prevent it? Or did it just fail?

01:01:15.632 --> 01:01:18.009
On the contrary, it worked very well.

01:01:18.259 --> 01:01:19.677
Our weapons are perfect.

01:01:19.886 --> 01:01:22.555
Once it reaches the planet,
it starts spreading,

01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:25.183
attacking all forms of life present.

01:01:25.433 --> 01:01:27.935
It either destroys them or enslaves them.

01:01:28.144 --> 01:01:32.148
That's how we got rid
of the Earth's developed race.

01:01:32.774 --> 01:01:33.941
You mean us?

01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:37.904
You don't actually think
that people built the pyramids?

01:01:38.154 --> 01:01:39.781
And the underwater cities?

01:01:41.574 --> 01:01:42.700
What are you saying?

01:01:43.493 --> 01:01:44.911
Don't worry.

01:01:45.161 --> 01:01:46.663
Look, what's your name?

01:01:46.996 --> 01:01:48.039
Styopa.

01:01:48.247 --> 01:01:49.290
I'm Maxim.

01:01:49.499 --> 01:01:50.667
Are you in charge?

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:53.294
Yes, I'm a lieutenant, I'm in charge here.

01:01:53.628 --> 01:01:54.837
We will take you to...

01:02:02.595 --> 01:02:05.390
Mankind itself is our weapon.

01:02:10.186 --> 01:02:12.563
You are our perfect invaders.

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:13.940
The perfect virus.

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:17.944
You wiped out the original population,
making room for us.

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:20.488
Look how alike we are.

01:02:20.822 --> 01:02:24.367
Two races from different solar systems
can't be this similar.

01:02:24.909 --> 01:02:26.577
We have the same DNA.

01:02:26.828 --> 01:02:29.539
So, we... are you?

01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:34.210
"Glod created man in His own image..."

01:02:34.794 --> 01:02:38.631
But, to be specific, you're the product
of our genetic engineering.

01:02:39.132 --> 01:02:41.175
You're a truncated version of us.

01:02:41.718 --> 01:02:44.804
We took away your psionic abilities.

01:02:45.054 --> 01:02:49.183
We gave you your drive to mate,
which awoke your primal instincts.

01:02:49.559 --> 01:02:51.978
Combined with your emotions and mortality,

01:02:52.186 --> 01:02:56.149
they result in your need to procreate
thoughtlessly and vigorously.

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:59.277
This way, the virus spread faster.

01:02:59.736 --> 01:03:03.906
As a result, you completed the mission
thousands of years sooner than expected.

01:03:04.198 --> 01:03:06.117
Men, what is happening?

01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:08.161
- The LT was KIA.
- What?

01:03:08.494 --> 01:03:09.579
By whom?

01:03:09.579 --> 01:03:12.206
The injured kid we picked up,
son of a bitch.

01:03:12.373 --> 01:03:13.666
What kid? Where is he?

01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:17.378
The LT is gone and so is the kid.
Get off the channel!

01:03:18.546 --> 01:03:20.590
What the hell? He was just a kid.

01:03:24.844 --> 01:03:27.138
Men, eyes open. I see a group of people.

01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:29.223
How many?

01:03:29.432 --> 01:03:31.058
A lot, and they're armed.

01:03:32.477 --> 01:03:34.854
You lack mercy and compassion.

01:03:35.188 --> 01:03:38.274
You're driven solely by procreation
and violence.

01:03:38.733 --> 01:03:42.403
When it comes to destroying lives,
there's no one like you.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:44.489
Movement detected.

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:46.783
That's why waves one and two

01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:51.287
were supposed to take you out,
leaving only the slaves.

01:03:52.705 --> 01:03:54.332
Otherwise, you won't stop...

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.876
until you destroy everything.

01:04:35.206 --> 01:04:37.041
Where are the shots coming from?

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.334
From everywhere.

01:04:41.838 --> 01:04:43.297
Suppressive fire!

01:04:49.595 --> 01:04:52.932
Alyona! Hide!

01:04:53.391 --> 01:04:54.725
Hide!

01:04:55.476 --> 01:04:56.477
He's hurt!

01:04:57.103 --> 01:04:58.271
What?

01:05:34.473 --> 01:05:36.601
Let's get out of here! Now!

01:05:47.862 --> 01:05:49.906
Stay there and lie still.

01:05:52.575 --> 01:05:54.744
Radio in the attack, one injured!

01:05:54.911 --> 01:05:56.162
Yes, sir!

01:05:59.749 --> 01:06:00.875
How is he?

01:06:00.875 --> 01:06:04.211
Fragment wound, but no signs
of internal bleeding.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:05.630
Motherfucker!

01:06:07.465 --> 01:06:09.508
Take cover!

01:06:14.931 --> 01:06:16.599
Get in the building!

01:06:19.685 --> 01:06:21.270
To the building!

01:06:23.856 --> 01:06:25.775
Seryoga, you alive?

01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:27.068
For now!

01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:28.861
Did you see where they fired from?

01:06:28.861 --> 01:06:30.738
From the building across from us.

01:06:34.784 --> 01:06:36.661
Ammunition exhausted

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:37.870
Son of a bitch!

01:06:38.245 --> 01:06:39.997
Give me a status report.

01:06:40.498 --> 01:06:43.918
Lynx was taken out completely,
the resupply team can't return.

01:06:45.127 --> 01:06:46.045
The WIAs?

01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:48.130
Unclear, requesting orders.

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:14.740
Olya! Olya, get back! Take cover!

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:33.968
David, find an RPG.

01:07:34.176 --> 01:07:35.386
On it.

01:07:37.513 --> 01:07:39.390
There you are.

01:07:42.393 --> 01:07:43.644
Get down!

01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:56.615
This is nonsense.

01:07:57.408 --> 01:07:58.993
You have to believe it.

01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:03.497
The sooner you accept the truth,
the more chances you have to win.

01:08:04.165 --> 01:08:05.541
Not you, us.

01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:06.959
Us?

01:08:08.294 --> 01:08:09.712
Aren't you with them?

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.338
You control them.

01:08:12.048 --> 01:08:13.257
Not exactly.

01:08:13.507 --> 01:08:17.053
I arrived on that ship with the virus,
someone else was with me.

01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:19.138
That was 200,000 years ago.

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:22.015
We were supposed to supervise
your development

01:08:22.308 --> 01:08:24.435
and welcome our kind when they arrive.

01:08:24.727 --> 01:08:28.272
I was certain
I was the only survivor by now.

01:08:28.773 --> 01:08:30.232
But, I guess I was wrong.

01:08:36.822 --> 01:08:38.866
Men, the tank's dead.

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:41.786
If you have any ideas, now is the time.

01:08:42.495 --> 01:08:44.580
Do it!

01:08:44.913 --> 01:08:46.247
Yes, sir.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:17.488
Let's cover them!

01:09:17.696 --> 01:09:18.863
Let's do it.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.559
The one who controls them...

01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:48.560
he's the same as you?

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:52.689
Exactly. His name is Ra,
he's their master.

01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:55.734
Together, they're a whole.

01:09:56.068 --> 01:09:57.361
We must kill him.

01:09:57.695 --> 01:10:00.739
Then I can take control of them
and neutralize them.

01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:04.577
But, first I need to find him,
that's why I'm here.

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:07.246
Because of Sasha?

01:10:07.496 --> 01:10:09.123
He can see Ra.

01:10:09.707 --> 01:10:13.711
We must take him to the outpost,
close to the quarantine zone.

01:10:14.128 --> 01:10:16.297
My assistant and I are going with you.

01:10:17.798 --> 01:10:20.593
What if everything you told me is a lie...

01:10:22.344 --> 01:10:23.804
and you're on their side?

01:10:24.096 --> 01:10:27.808
You must decide
whether to believe me or not.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.730
Yes, I'm listening.

01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:38.736
Yes.

01:10:38.944 --> 01:10:40.946
Yes, alright, I'm on my way.

01:10:46.368 --> 01:10:48.746
Our recon teams were attacked.

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:51.832
They went on the offensive.

01:10:52.124 --> 01:10:53.334
We're wasting time.

01:11:30.079 --> 01:11:31.497
They killed Petya.

01:11:32.665 --> 01:11:34.500
Kolya is dead, too.

01:11:42.091 --> 01:11:43.842
They're coming from everywhere!

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:46.262
Let's regroup!

01:11:54.395 --> 01:11:56.355
They're at the entrance.

01:12:03.237 --> 01:12:04.655
- Hold the door.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:17.251
Olya!

01:12:18.127 --> 01:12:19.628
The signal flare!

01:13:02.796 --> 01:13:04.631
Where is that? Which team?

01:13:05.007 --> 01:13:07.718
Looks like 7, in the direction of Kirov.

01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:29.406
The war has begun.

01:13:33.118 --> 01:13:35.037
Give me the WP.

01:13:45.798 --> 01:13:47.341
- Olya!
- Yes!

01:13:47.966 --> 01:13:49.718
Come with me! Let's go!

01:13:53.972 --> 01:13:55.349
Here. Let's go.

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:08.779
They retreated.

01:14:09.029 --> 01:14:10.447
Hold the door.

01:14:11.115 --> 01:14:12.533
They won't be back soon.

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:13.951
They're like ants!

01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:17.204
They're not afraid to die.
I took out like 40 of them!

01:14:20.082 --> 01:14:21.750
We got a few, too.

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:23.961
Why are they attacking us?

01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:28.424
We don't know that yet.

01:14:28.841 --> 01:14:32.886
We have another problem. We need
to bug out of a compromised position.

01:14:33.804 --> 01:14:35.639
David, get the fast rope ready.

01:14:35.889 --> 01:14:38.350
We can fasten it to that corner.

01:14:38.851 --> 01:14:40.936
Hopefully, they don't have us surrounded.

01:14:41.103 --> 01:14:42.938
Which is highly likely.

01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:45.441
Can't we call anyone?

01:14:45.691 --> 01:14:46.692
No.

01:14:46.942 --> 01:14:48.944
We have short-range communication.

01:14:49.361 --> 01:14:52.948
We launched the signal flare,
they know we need help.

01:14:53.157 --> 01:14:54.825
I saw more of those.

01:14:57.286 --> 01:14:58.203
How many?

01:14:58.454 --> 01:15:01.331
About seven or eight purple ones
and three red.

01:15:04.126 --> 01:15:05.836
What the fuck?

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:08.797
Does that mean they're not coming for us?

01:15:09.089 --> 01:15:10.340
Well...

01:15:10.632 --> 01:15:13.260
that means we shouldn't count on it.

01:15:15.179 --> 01:15:17.306
Looks like a major attack.

01:15:20.309 --> 01:15:21.977
Alright, we're on our own.

01:15:22.436 --> 01:15:23.604
I'll take the rope.

01:15:23.896 --> 01:15:26.690
David, be on the lookout,
they're too quiet.

01:15:42.664 --> 01:15:44.917
Are you even mortal?

01:15:46.418 --> 01:15:49.254
There's no such thing as immortality.

01:15:49.713 --> 01:15:51.882
But, I will live forever...

01:15:51.882 --> 01:15:53.800
If no one kills me.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.221
We can alter the structure of our bodies...

01:15:57.221 --> 01:16:00.349
renewing our cells.

01:16:00.349 --> 01:16:03.352
Can you cure any disease?

01:16:03.769 --> 01:16:05.145
Yes.

01:16:05.145 --> 01:16:10.234
For instance... cerebral palsy.

01:16:12.444 --> 01:16:17.491
I couldn't walk... I didn't feel my legs at all...

01:16:17.866 --> 01:16:20.869
Is that how you buy loyalty?

01:16:21.245 --> 01:16:25.123
I don't buy anything. I help.

01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:29.962
And Zhenya helps me of his own free will.

01:16:30.462 --> 01:16:34.049
That's the advantage we have over slaves.

01:16:48.355 --> 01:16:50.774
I'm glad to see you, but to be honest,

01:16:51.066 --> 01:16:54.278
I'd feel better if you stayed behind.

01:16:55.737 --> 01:16:56.905
Who is that?

01:16:56.905 --> 01:16:59.366
They can help us, it's a long story.

01:16:59.992 --> 01:17:01.868
What do you need to...

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:04.913
to find who you're looking for?

01:17:05.205 --> 01:17:06.999
We need a quiet place

01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:09.835
where Sasha can concentrate.

01:17:17.217 --> 01:17:18.385
What do you see?

01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:20.762
Nothing.

01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:24.182
The bodies are still there,
no one removed them.

01:17:24.516 --> 01:17:26.184
Perhaps they left?

01:17:26.602 --> 01:17:29.187
That's unlikely, they're regrouping.

01:17:30.022 --> 01:17:31.690
Do we really need to leave?

01:17:33.025 --> 01:17:34.776
We'll die if we stay.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.405
There, we have a chance.
A small one, but a chance.

01:17:42.534 --> 01:17:43.744
The commander's?

01:17:44.286 --> 01:17:47.623
It was, he won't need it anymore.

01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:50.125
Alright.

01:17:50.292 --> 01:17:52.127
How far to the outpost?

01:17:52.294 --> 01:17:56.423
We won't make it to the outpost.
David, where did you see the red flares?

01:17:56.882 --> 01:17:58.925
Two there and one there.

01:18:00.677 --> 01:18:03.722
Alright, judging from the location,

01:18:04.348 --> 01:18:07.351
that was either Team 8, 9, or 10.

01:18:08.352 --> 01:18:10.729
Or Teams 5 and 6 here.

01:18:11.938 --> 01:18:13.857
There were no flares there.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.485
This is Team 3

01:18:17.486 --> 01:18:19.112
and 4. That way.

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.531
That way is closer.

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.825
No red flares doesn't mean they're alive.

01:18:24.034 --> 01:18:25.952
Maybe, they had no time to launch them.

01:18:26.203 --> 01:18:29.831
Maybe. But we're hoping for the best,
right?

01:18:30.666 --> 01:18:32.250
Men, let's get down.

01:18:32.584 --> 01:18:33.585
Your foot.

01:18:33.752 --> 01:18:35.629
- What's this?
- Life-saving panties.

01:18:36.213 --> 01:18:40.300
Let's say they're alive and out there,
just like us.

01:18:40.509 --> 01:18:42.010
We won't make it there.

01:18:42.219 --> 01:18:45.555
Judging from the map,
we're moving away from the outpost.

01:18:45.806 --> 01:18:49.726
First of all, we outnumber them.
Second, their radio might be working.

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:54.189
If not, we'll move on to the next team,
then the next one after that.

01:18:55.399 --> 01:18:59.111
The more of us are out there,
the better our chances to survive.

01:18:59.403 --> 01:19:01.613
No, I'm not going there.

01:19:02.072 --> 01:19:03.240
No.

01:19:04.616 --> 01:19:06.618
Calm down. You can do this.

01:19:09.246 --> 01:19:12.374
It's easy, you don't do anything,
I'll lower you down.

01:19:13.083 --> 01:19:15.877
Feet against the wall,
and don't grab the rope.

01:19:16.211 --> 01:19:17.129
Understood?

01:19:17.295 --> 01:19:18.964
- Yes.
- Let's go.

01:19:20.674 --> 01:19:21.800
I can't, I'm scared.

01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:24.261
Calm down, it's alright.

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:28.348
- No, I can't do this!
- Hey!

01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:34.020
Let's go.

01:19:54.249 --> 01:19:57.544
I'll help you get in the right state.

01:19:58.295 --> 01:20:00.756
Try to remember how your dreams began.

01:20:01.298 --> 01:20:03.925
First, you heard the voices of his slaves.

01:20:04.384 --> 01:20:06.553
Their conversations and orders.

01:20:06.887 --> 01:20:08.263
Try to hear them now.

01:20:10.348 --> 01:20:13.310
You must listen for the one
who controls them.

01:20:14.853 --> 01:20:16.104
Listen.

01:20:17.522 --> 01:20:22.027
Everything depends on you and only you.

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:27.908
Hear his voice.

01:20:59.105 --> 01:21:00.190
What's that?

01:21:01.525 --> 01:21:03.902
I don't understand. Is that a skyscraper?

01:21:07.197 --> 01:21:08.365
He's there.

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:10.826
He controls them from there.

01:21:15.956 --> 01:21:17.207
I know where he is.

01:21:17.415 --> 01:21:18.917
He's in Kirov.

01:21:26.216 --> 01:21:27.300
Well done.

01:21:27.926 --> 01:21:30.220
You did everything you had to do.

01:21:35.642 --> 01:21:38.436
We need to mobilize everyone and move out.

01:21:39.479 --> 01:21:41.690
Can anyone tell me
what the hell is going on?

01:21:42.607 --> 01:21:44.442
- Lt. Colonel!
- It's...

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.862
...hard to explain.

01:21:47.112 --> 01:21:49.698
You were invaded by alien forces.

01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:53.994
About 160 million people have survived
outside the Circle of Life.

01:21:54.244 --> 01:21:58.248
From day one, they've been gathering
toward the Circle,

01:21:58.456 --> 01:22:02.210
collecting weapons, grouping,
and preparing for war.

01:22:02.836 --> 01:22:04.796
Are you from military intelligence?

01:22:11.678 --> 01:22:13.179
What the hell?

01:22:13.638 --> 01:22:16.641
- How did you...
- I'm what you'd call an "alien."

01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:19.477
But, I'm on your side.

01:22:20.186 --> 01:22:23.189
For now, we still have a chance
to turn things around.

01:22:24.024 --> 01:22:25.358
We must take this chance.

01:22:25.567 --> 01:22:27.777
The enemy is controlled
by someone like him.

01:22:28.028 --> 01:22:31.448
We must take him out
or the Circle of Life won't survive.

01:22:33.992 --> 01:22:36.453
Major, Moscow is under attack.

01:22:39.956 --> 01:22:42.959
The connection is weak,
HQ in Nizhny isn't responding.

01:22:43.251 --> 01:22:45.045
They broke through, sir.

01:22:51.051 --> 01:22:53.053
That means we're almost out of time.

01:22:53.386 --> 01:22:55.305
I'll explain it on the way.

01:23:32.801 --> 01:23:34.970
They're not that scary.

01:23:40.767 --> 01:23:42.310
Please...

01:23:46.106 --> 01:23:48.692
Miss, help us.

01:23:49.985 --> 01:23:52.904
- What?
- We were captured.

01:23:54.739 --> 01:23:58.368
We were here...

01:23:59.285 --> 01:24:00.912
Let me record.

01:24:01.079 --> 01:24:03.707
Miss, please, I'm begging you.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.167
No!

01:24:06.334 --> 01:24:07.877
- Keep her back.
- No!

01:24:08.086 --> 01:24:10.338
No! Please, no!

01:24:10.588 --> 01:24:12.966
Did you forget the kid who killed the LT?

01:24:13.299 --> 01:24:14.551
Did you forget that?

01:24:16.011 --> 01:24:18.013
They can pretend to be anyone.

01:24:18.763 --> 01:24:20.765
I don't give a shit anymore. Got it?

01:24:21.016 --> 01:24:22.642
Pull yourself together.

01:24:24.269 --> 01:24:26.354
Men, grab the ammo and the food.

01:24:34.988 --> 01:24:36.031
Get down!

01:24:47.042 --> 01:24:48.460
Come on.

01:25:17.447 --> 01:25:18.615
Motherfucker!

01:25:44.766 --> 01:25:45.934
Son of a bitch.

01:25:48.394 --> 01:25:49.437
Let's go.

01:25:56.945 --> 01:25:58.321
Wait.

01:26:02.408 --> 01:26:04.536
I have to tell you something.

01:26:06.246 --> 01:26:07.497
I'll catch up.

01:26:12.794 --> 01:26:14.420
He saw me.

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:19.509
He looked me in the eye,
and it was beyond terrifying.

01:26:21.136 --> 01:26:23.471
I've never been that terrified in my life.

01:26:24.472 --> 01:26:25.890
Don't be afraid.

01:26:26.141 --> 01:26:28.309
I won't let him get to you.

01:26:29.727 --> 01:26:31.938
But, you'll be better off here. Alright?

01:26:32.397 --> 01:26:34.107
It will be safer this way.

01:26:48.663 --> 01:26:50.874
We'll try to make it in 24 hours.

01:26:51.958 --> 01:26:55.670
I hope this isn't all bullshit,
and we can stop the attack.

01:26:56.045 --> 01:26:57.046
Hang in there.

01:26:57.881 --> 01:27:00.091
We'll be fine, Major. Good luck!

01:28:03.988 --> 01:28:05.156
Are you hurt?

01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:11.537
We need to reach Team 4 somehow.

01:28:13.498 --> 01:28:15.208
Preferably, by car.

01:28:15.792 --> 01:28:18.294
Check the cars,
maybe you'll find one that runs.

01:28:30.181 --> 01:28:31.307
It's running.

01:28:34.102 --> 01:28:35.937
There's still half a tank left.

01:28:39.357 --> 01:28:41.025
Find the first aid kit.

01:28:49.659 --> 01:28:52.036
Is Sasha in the other car?

01:28:53.955 --> 01:28:57.000
Ra saw Sasha and now knows where he is.

01:28:57.834 --> 01:29:00.420
Being near him is an unnecessary risk now.

01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:02.880
Stop the car!

01:29:08.803 --> 01:29:10.013
We're going back! Now!

01:29:10.263 --> 01:29:11.639
What's the problem?

01:29:22.025 --> 01:29:26.487
Outpost is under a guided missile attack!
I repeat, missile attack incoming!

01:30:18.414 --> 01:30:21.834
What the hell? You saw this coming.
They're dead because of you.

01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:24.462
Do you even want to win?

01:30:24.754 --> 01:30:25.880
Not like this.

01:30:26.047 --> 01:30:29.717
If Sasha were with us,
these missiles would hit us.

01:30:29.967 --> 01:30:34.680
Then, mankind wouldn't stand a chance.

01:30:34.931 --> 01:30:37.141
The death of everyone
at the outpost

01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:40.103
was a necessary sacrifice
to save everyone else.

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.006
It's a meat grinder.

01:31:13.469 --> 01:31:14.679
Stay here.

01:31:30.486 --> 01:31:31.821
Yura!

01:31:34.532 --> 01:31:35.700
Oleg.

01:31:38.703 --> 01:31:41.205
How did you know it was me?
Why didn't you shoot?

01:31:41.414 --> 01:31:43.875
I ran out of ammo,
otherwise, I'd shoot you.

01:31:45.084 --> 01:31:48.504
I figured you'd get closer,
and I'd twist your neck.

01:31:50.214 --> 01:31:51.966
I bet I'd twist yours first.

01:31:57.513 --> 01:31:59.015
I'm glad you're alive.

01:32:00.808 --> 01:32:02.477
Just the two of you?

01:32:03.936 --> 01:32:04.979
Yes.

01:32:06.689 --> 01:32:08.566
Not too many here either.

01:32:31.756 --> 01:32:33.508
Are these all the survivors?

01:32:35.259 --> 01:32:36.344
The press?

01:32:36.677 --> 01:32:38.346
Welcome!

01:32:38.971 --> 01:32:42.266
I'd get up, but I'm afraid
my guts would fall out.

01:32:45.311 --> 01:32:46.729
Do you have any ammo left?

01:32:48.314 --> 01:32:50.024
One magazine left.

01:32:50.525 --> 01:32:51.901
Comms?

01:32:52.443 --> 01:32:54.487
Nothing with the outpost or HQ.

01:32:57.907 --> 01:32:59.033
The hell with it.

01:33:22.265 --> 01:33:23.474
They're here.

01:33:23.849 --> 01:33:25.101
Stop!

01:33:25.393 --> 01:33:27.186
Stop all the vehicles.

01:33:36.237 --> 01:33:38.489
I know it was terrifying.

01:33:38.906 --> 01:33:40.491
It will be alright.

01:33:41.659 --> 01:33:43.035
What about the other teams?

01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:48.124
Thanks for picking us up at least.

01:33:48.499 --> 01:33:50.418
We're not taking you.

01:33:50.668 --> 01:33:51.711
What?

01:33:52.878 --> 01:33:54.589
We're going to Kirov.

01:33:55.339 --> 01:33:57.717
We must destroy their command.

01:34:00.511 --> 01:34:03.306
Back to that hellhole?
We just came from there.

01:34:03.556 --> 01:34:06.934
We have civilians — a doctor, a reporter,
some WIAs.

01:34:07.184 --> 01:34:08.394
Are we taking them?

01:34:08.394 --> 01:34:10.354
There's nowhere to go to.

01:34:10.646 --> 01:34:14.400
The outpost is destroyed,
contact with command is lost.

01:34:15.026 --> 01:34:16.819
The Circle of Life is under attack.

01:34:17.153 --> 01:34:19.989
They broke through,
and we're the last hope.

01:34:20.781 --> 01:34:22.700
Actually, he is.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.956
- Freeze!
- Weapons down! He's on our side.

01:34:38.174 --> 01:34:39.759
Let's move out.

01:35:04.450 --> 01:35:08.829
You're all asleep.

01:35:08.829 --> 01:35:12.416
But you, Yura, woke up.

01:35:12.416 --> 01:35:16.337
It's war. It makes a person
who he's created to be.

01:35:16.337 --> 01:35:19.382
You awoke your true nature.

01:35:19.382 --> 01:35:22.468
That's what makes you stronger
than the others.

01:35:22.468 --> 01:35:25.096
You'll help me kill our mutual enemy.

01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.267
We're entering the city.

01:35:43.572 --> 01:35:44.699
Are you OK?

01:35:46.659 --> 01:35:48.994
Do you think they'll take Moscow?

01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:54.208
For all I know, we're all that's left
of mankind.

01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:21.610
Why aren't they attacking us?

01:36:21.944 --> 01:36:24.321
He thinks I died at the outpost.

01:36:24.613 --> 01:36:27.783
Besides, the main force
is in the Circle of Life.

01:36:28.242 --> 01:36:31.078
I'm trying to keep us invisible to them.

01:36:31.495 --> 01:36:34.331
But, the closer we get to Ra,
the weaker I get.

01:36:34.665 --> 01:36:37.626
I'm sure he took measures
to protect himself.

01:36:40.421 --> 01:36:41.464
Major!

01:36:41.964 --> 01:36:44.258
There are armed civilians ahead

01:37:20.002 --> 01:37:21.378
Let's go!

01:38:04.672 --> 01:38:06.715
Heading straight to the skyscraper.

01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:08.569
He will throw everything he has at you.

01:39:09.528 --> 01:39:10.946
I need time.

01:39:11.363 --> 01:39:13.824
I'll take a few soldiers...

01:39:14.158 --> 01:39:15.826
and him.

01:39:31.675 --> 01:39:34.970
Alright, they'll be here soon.
Everyone, get in position!

01:39:39.099 --> 01:39:42.436
Civilians, take cover and stay there.

01:40:05.626 --> 01:40:07.461
Did I miss something?

01:40:09.338 --> 01:40:11.382
He ordered us to guard the entrance.

01:40:11.674 --> 01:40:12.925
We'll fight till the end.

01:40:14.468 --> 01:40:15.594
Alright.

01:40:15.844 --> 01:40:17.638
I'm here if you need me.

01:40:24.561 --> 01:40:27.314
I'll make a bet and assume
it won't be a long battle.

01:40:27.523 --> 01:40:29.274
I'm not much of a gambler.

01:40:38.492 --> 01:40:39.660
Fire!

01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:04.518
Move in!

01:41:22.619 --> 01:41:24.621
RPGI on the right!

01:41:30.419 --> 01:41:31.712
Dammit, they're insane!

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:34.089
I warned you about these freaks.

01:41:34.465 --> 01:41:36.216
Then we're freaks, too.

01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:40.804
Son of a bitch! They're everywhere!

01:41:46.602 --> 01:41:47.978
Please excuse me,

01:41:48.979 --> 01:41:50.606
but it's time for me to go.

01:41:51.899 --> 01:41:53.692
You fart too much in here anyway.

01:42:52.376 --> 01:42:55.254
We need to take a small team
to the neighboring building.

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:57.256
- We'll take the fire!
- Belay that!

01:42:57.464 --> 01:42:59.550
They asked for time, we gave them time.

01:42:59.758 --> 01:43:01.885
- Let's move out!
- Alright, let's fall back!

01:43:02.136 --> 01:43:04.179
Someone needs to cover us!

01:43:04.429 --> 01:43:07.057
My team and I are staying,
you're in charge.

01:43:07.266 --> 01:43:09.351
- Oleg, go with them!
- But, Major...

01:43:09.518 --> 01:43:10.978
It's an order!

01:43:16.441 --> 01:43:18.652
Let's go upstairs,
we're better off there.

01:43:18.652 --> 01:43:19.695
And the others?

01:43:19.862 --> 01:43:21.655
The others will cover us from here.

01:43:25.367 --> 01:43:28.328
- But we can't...
- We can! Or it's all for nothing.

01:43:28.328 --> 01:43:29.413
Move it!

01:43:35.335 --> 01:43:36.420
Attention, soldiers!

01:43:36.712 --> 01:43:40.716
Let's take as many of these assholes
with us as possible.

01:43:41.592 --> 01:43:44.011
It's been an honor to serve with you, men.

01:43:46.263 --> 01:43:47.764
Yes, Major.

01:44:07.576 --> 01:44:09.077
What the hell?

01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:00.337
Concentrate all fire on that truck!

01:45:18.188 --> 01:45:19.314
This is it.

01:45:46.466 --> 01:45:47.926
Now.

01:47:02.793 --> 01:47:05.629
Are there many like you on the ship?

01:47:06.296 --> 01:47:08.799
Yes, many. Does that scare you?

01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:11.051
No.

01:47:15.889 --> 01:47:17.057
Don't be afraid.

01:47:17.391 --> 01:47:20.060
Everything is how it's supposed to be.

01:47:20.435 --> 01:47:21.937
What do we do next?

01:47:22.979 --> 01:47:26.775
You'll do what you were created for.
Kill.

01:47:27.317 --> 01:47:29.820
Wars have always made you stronger.

01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:33.573
So much stronger,
that you became a threat to us.

01:47:34.032 --> 01:47:38.161
Ra saw that and made up a religion for you
based on love.

01:47:38.745 --> 01:47:40.872
He hoped the wars would stop

01:47:41.123 --> 01:47:44.418
and that mankind would remain
in a state of infancy,

01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:48.213
with love for those around you
and a total lack of technology.

01:47:48.547 --> 01:47:53.260
But, you turned religion into a reason
for more war and endless conflict.

01:47:53.635 --> 01:47:55.846
You continued to kill each other.

01:47:56.054 --> 01:47:58.140
This is what you're made for.

01:47:58.432 --> 01:48:00.892
The nature of a virus always takes over.

01:48:01.059 --> 01:48:04.688
You don't feel love, compassion, mercy.

01:48:05.230 --> 01:48:07.149
Ra created all that for you.

01:48:07.399 --> 01:48:10.110
When they arrive, you'll kill them all.

01:48:10.444 --> 01:48:11.862
I'll show you how.

01:48:12.404 --> 01:48:13.947
Why now?

01:48:14.364 --> 01:48:15.907
Why didn't you come sooner?

01:48:16.074 --> 01:48:18.535
Before 8 billion people died!

01:48:19.828 --> 01:48:21.997
You could've stopped the radiation!

01:48:23.623 --> 01:48:24.708
I could have.

01:48:25.083 --> 01:48:27.210
But that would disrupt the original plan,

01:48:27.377 --> 01:48:29.838
and the ship would go into
its defensive mode.

01:48:30.046 --> 01:48:33.633
Right now, they don't have a clue,
and we have a chance.

01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:36.386
So for you, this is nothing but numbers?

01:48:36.678 --> 01:48:38.221
Human life is just math?

01:48:38.513 --> 01:48:42.476
You let them kill people for nothing,
just to make your plan work.

01:48:43.602 --> 01:48:46.521
Just like you let everyone die
at the outpost.

01:48:46.855 --> 01:48:50.150
Enough of you have survived,
there's no need for more.

01:48:50.859 --> 01:48:51.902
Really?

01:48:52.194 --> 01:48:54.488
So there's no need for my parents?

01:48:55.322 --> 01:48:56.531
There isn't.

01:48:57.741 --> 01:48:59.326
Don't you get it yet?

01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:04.039
You and your offspring will be
the beginning of a new civilization.

01:49:04.956 --> 01:49:08.585
For centuries, you believed in someone
you'd never seen.

01:49:09.503 --> 01:49:11.796
Now, your god will always be with you.

01:49:12.214 --> 01:49:13.798
But you're not God!

01:49:14.591 --> 01:49:15.967
You're the Devil!

01:49:16.259 --> 01:49:18.345
I was helping you all this time!

01:49:19.596 --> 01:49:22.140
I am the god you deserve.

01:49:24.684 --> 01:49:27.604
Leave us alone.

01:49:27.979 --> 01:49:33.318
Put your gun away, moron.
We need him alive!

01:49:33.318 --> 01:49:35.487
A million more like him are coming.

01:49:35.487 --> 01:49:39.324
How are you planning to fight them?
With this gun?

01:49:39.324 --> 01:49:43.745
I'd rather take my chances with the gun
than let him mess with my head.

01:49:56.967 --> 01:49:58.218
I'm so sorry.

01:50:15.610 --> 01:50:17.028
I'm sorry!

01:50:23.535 --> 01:50:25.537
That's what I was talking about.

01:50:25.787 --> 01:50:28.582
Even in the weakest of the species,
such as this one,

01:50:28.748 --> 01:50:30.333
the urge to kill is strong.

01:50:34.254 --> 01:50:35.213
Come here!

01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:36.923
- Oleg, no.
- Yura!

01:50:36.923 --> 01:50:38.967
We don't stand a chance without him.

01:50:38.967 --> 01:50:40.468
- Don't you see...
- No!

01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:34.147
Take this, bitch!

01:51:50.121 --> 01:51:52.082
Don't disappoint me.

01:52:05.303 --> 01:52:06.346
Hello, son.

01:52:06.346 --> 01:52:08.390
Do you want to kill me?

01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:09.766
Go ahead.

01:52:10.141 --> 01:52:12.143
You already did it once...

01:52:12.602 --> 01:52:14.979
when you abandoned your mother and me.

01:52:15.772 --> 01:52:18.400
You'll never be as good
as your brother.

01:53:34.225 --> 01:53:36.269
Now we're definitely dead.

01:54:54.514 --> 01:54:55.557
Where are they?

01:54:57.225 --> 01:54:59.269
Why isn't anyone coming out?

01:55:07.777 --> 01:55:08.987
Let's go.

01:55:17.036 --> 01:55:19.080
Come on, finish me off.

01:55:32.176 --> 01:55:34.804
We're all going to die anyway!

01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:51.858
They're all sleeping.

01:58:16.924 --> 01:58:18.009
This is oxygen.

01:58:18.801 --> 01:58:20.553
It flows through these pipes.

01:58:21.888 --> 01:58:24.098
Soon they will wake up.

01:58:24.474 --> 01:58:26.559
I guess Ra was supposed to wake them.

01:58:28.144 --> 01:58:29.645
What do we do?

01:58:29.937 --> 01:58:31.564
Step back.

01:58:47.163 --> 01:58:48.206
It's a timer.

01:58:49.248 --> 01:58:51.751
We don't have enough time...
or ammo.

01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:37.964
Let's make sure they don't wake up.

02:00:32.977 --> 02:00:35.104
There's gravity everywhere!

02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:07.803
This is the last one!

02:01:11.057 --> 02:01:12.058
Dammit.

02:01:13.517 --> 02:01:14.727
Olya!

02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:17.605
Throw me the ax!

02:02:01.148 --> 02:02:03.401
- What are you waiting for?
- Wait!

02:02:24.588 --> 02:02:26.132
Are these children?
