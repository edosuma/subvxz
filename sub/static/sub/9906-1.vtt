01:17.321 --> 01:20.040
Give me my Romeo, and when he shall die,

01:20.140 --> 01:22.998
take him and cut him
out to little stars -

01:23.321 --> 01:25.785
and he'll make the
face of heaven so fine.

01:25.885 --> 01:28.900
And all the world will be
in love with the night -

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
<music>Mystical: Shake Ya Ass</music>

01:31.481 --> 01:35.348
and... make the face of
heaven so fine that all...

01:35.448 --> 01:37.670
the world will be in love....

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
<music>Mystical: Shake Ya Ass</music>

01:42.760 --> 01:45.194
... all the world will be
in love with the night...

01:46.440 --> 01:47.919
Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:58.200 --> 02:01.795
- Woody, will you turn that down?
- Sorry, I can't hear you!

02:02.000 --> 02:04.798
Turn the noise down!

02:05.440 --> 02:06.759
Sorry, did you say something?

02:06.960 --> 02:10.634
I'm trying to study but it's impossible
with that racket going on!

02:10.840 --> 02:12.378
- It's not racket, that's Mystical!

02:12.478 --> 02:14.515
Whatever it is, will you
please switch it off?

02:14.720 --> 02:17.837
- What's it worth?
- The gratitude of a music lover?

02:19.560 --> 02:22.198
Alright, I turn it off!

02:22.639 --> 02:26.147
If you flash me! Show me
what girls are all about!

02:26.247 --> 02:27.155
You are a pig!

02:28.319 --> 02:30.992
- Anyway, I've seen them before!
- What! You have not!

02:40.839 --> 02:41.794
Have now!

02:47.639 --> 02:49.630
Good morning, Mr. Fluffy.

02:50.919 --> 02:54.229
- Woody, are you up yet?
- Oh, yeah!

03:02.159 --> 03:05.309
- Good morning, Daddy!
- I have some mail for you, princess.

03:05.878 --> 03:07.550
It's from Yale!

03:12.678 --> 03:14.305
I have an interview next week!

03:14.405 --> 03:16.557
I applied for early
action for you, honey!

03:16.758 --> 03:18.146
My precious little
girl are going to Yale!

03:18.246 --> 03:19.830
I have to get through the
interview first, mother!

03:20.038 --> 03:23.508
- You won't let us down, never have.
- Never has.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.474
- Isn't it exciting, Ted?
- It's very excititing, Katherine.

03:26.678 --> 03:29.431
- Are you excited?
- I am.

03:30.118 --> 03:34.236
I'm so excited I could yell it
from the roof tops!

03:38.438 --> 03:40.068
Thank you, mother!

<music>Bachman Turner Overdrive:

03:45.059 --> 03:45.800
Everything OK back there?

03:45.900 --> 03:46.417
No problem, honey.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.997
Just searing off a
couple of finger prints.

03:49.097 --> 03:50.396
Carry on, my good woman.

03:53.957 --> 03:56.471
- Big game's coming up soon, son?
- Yep!

03:57.517 --> 04:01.396
Coach says all the big college scouts
gonna be at the game.

04:01.496 --> 04:02.297
Yeah, I know.

04:02.397 --> 04:06.834
Speciality of the House! I call
it 'Eggs What the Heck'

04:07.797 --> 04:11.233
So much of fine cuisine is down to
presentation, don't you think, son?

04:11.437 --> 04:13.189
Oh yeah, absolutely!

04:13.517 --> 04:17.988
You'll be the first member of
my family to go to college.

04:18.197 --> 04:21.712
He'll be the first member of your
family to go to freaking school!

04:22.117 --> 04:23.709
That's true.

04:24.237 --> 04:28.468
But son, if thing's don't work out,
there'll always be a job for you -

04:28.676 --> 04:31.190
with Stan the Man at Spatula World.

04:38.316 --> 04:40.445
- To me, the greatest
living American should...

04:40.545 --> 04:42.025
have individual accomplishments -

04:42.236 --> 04:46.195
but also have a lasting influcence
on America and with the world.

04:46.396 --> 04:51.151
And that is why after careful
consideration my candidate...

05:00.476 --> 05:02.512
- Yo, what's up boy?
- Hi, Horse!

05:04.276 --> 05:07.791
- Nice grab, Horse! How's it hanging?
- To the floor, my friend!

05:08.236 --> 05:10.510
What say we shift this
baby into warp drive, huh?

05:11.555 --> 05:13.501
I want you to feel the
wind blowing through...

05:13.601 --> 05:15.070
the hair of your fine muscular ass!

05:17.715 --> 05:19.433
Hit it please!

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
<music>Eminem: Without Me</music>

05:46.835 --> 05:48.507
Well, looky here!

05:48.715 --> 05:51.659
Is that not a pencil necked
virigin girl I see before me?

05:51.759 --> 05:52.673
I do believe it is.

05:53.114 --> 05:57.124
She's standing dangerously close
to a vast pool of water.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.834
For a smart girl, that ain't so smart.

06:40.953 --> 06:42.227
Thank you!

06:46.553 --> 06:48.783
OK, just keep walking.

06:49.233 --> 06:50.985
No one will notice.

06:52.793 --> 06:54.863
Who wants cotton candy?

06:59.433 --> 07:02.152
Hey, Nell, I love what you've
done with your hair!

07:02.353 --> 07:04.913
Thanks, Glixen.

07:15.793 --> 07:18.864
Three, two one...

07:19.632 --> 07:21.065
Hey, watch it!

07:24.192 --> 07:25.511
- Harry!
- What's up baby!

07:25.712 --> 07:27.350
Wow wow, people around!

07:34.872 --> 07:36.749
Nice look!

07:36.992 --> 07:39.745
Special needs boy and his muse,
the lovely Clamydia.

07:39.952 --> 07:41.624
My name's Breanna, you geek!

07:42.912 --> 07:44.804
By the way, sorry about
this morning.

07:44.904 --> 07:46.507
That puddle just... 
showed up in front of us!

07:46.712 --> 07:49.943
Oh, that's OK, please don't
apologize it, I understand.

07:51.192 --> 07:53.948
While archetypal outsiders
such as myself...

07:54.048 --> 07:57.506
rarely fit comfortably into
high school environements -

07:57.712 --> 08:00.908
this is as good as your life will get.

08:01.111 --> 08:03.938
The big football star and his
vacuous cheerleader girlfriend...

08:04.038 --> 08:04.740
Head cheerleader.

08:06.511 --> 08:09.142
Because, let's face it.
The old gray matter...

08:09.242 --> 08:11.426
ain't exactly top level, is it Woodster?

08:11.631 --> 08:15.067
So you end up with
a job with your dad -

08:15.271 --> 08:17.626
and probably marry Breanna here.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.710
But soon you start drinking to numb
this aching feeling you have inside.

08:21.911 --> 08:24.103
Fast forward a few years
and you're a drunk...

08:24.203 --> 08:26.541
fat guy at a bar talking
about the good old days.

08:26.751 --> 08:30.426
While your little wife whose
looks have gone to the dodo -

08:30.631 --> 08:33.552
is prepping up her self
esteem with squalid...

08:33.652 --> 08:37.025
sexual encounters with your
friends behind your back.

08:38.791 --> 08:41.462
- What friends?
- I'm guessing most of them.

08:42.950 --> 08:44.349
Have a good day.

08:45.550 --> 08:48.691
Class, please turn to
page 488. Paragraph...

08:48.791 --> 08:50.544
demarked 'Early history' -

08:50.750 --> 08:54.220
which reads: 'Combined
with the study of mankind -

08:54.430 --> 08:57.740
in all its aspects,
especially human culture -

08:57.950 --> 09:01.765
we are therefore examining
that society through...

09:01.865 --> 09:04.788
the exploration of classical structure.'

09:05.390 --> 09:10.339
Now, do not forget to make full use
of your abstract database.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.132
And class, please make
sure the references of...

09:13.232 --> 09:15.340
the source material
include the internet.

09:22.230 --> 09:23.218
That's OK for now but -

09:23.429 --> 09:27.342
you might want to omit that
page from your reference list.

09:27.549 --> 09:31.019
Now, Mr. Zbornak will be taking
your field trip this week.

09:33.029 --> 09:36.419
I tried on the most
amazing dress for the dance.

09:36.629 --> 09:41.259
Think Beyonce's wow-factor meets Gwen
Stefani's outfit of individuality -

09:41.469 --> 09:43.903
with just a sprinkling
of designer slut Aguilera.

09:44.109 --> 09:46.296
The whole thing's very
Madonna...

09:46.396 --> 09:47.465
before she got old naturally.

09:47.669 --> 09:49.227
Sounds hot!

09:49.709 --> 09:52.012
Now, I think Armani
would be good for you.

09:52.112 --> 09:53.463
Stylish yet understated -

09:53.669 --> 09:56.388
so you look good but you don't
distract attention from me.

09:58.789 --> 10:00.754
Mr Deanne! If it's
not too much trouble?

10:00.854 --> 10:01.667
OK, just a minute!

10:07.908 --> 10:10.820
Take a look at this odd looking fella!

10:11.548 --> 10:14.062
Texcatlipoca -

10:14.268 --> 10:17.233
the ancient Aztek god
of sorcery. Associated...

10:17.333 --> 10:18.944
with the notion of destiny.

10:19.148 --> 10:21.582
Tex here has an interesting resume:

10:21.788 --> 10:25.098
He was the god of night,
lord of the smoking mirror.

10:25.508 --> 10:27.783
A shape shifter -

10:28.348 --> 10:30.578
a powerful SOB.

10:30.988 --> 10:34.867
Mr Deanne, do you think I might
have your attention?

10:35.348 --> 10:38.897
Or does Mr. Horson have something
particularly interesting to say?

10:39.188 --> 10:41.986
I'm betting on unlikely.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.529
OK, time is short,
people. I want you to...

10:45.629 --> 10:47.783
pair off and take in
the rest yourselves.

10:47.987 --> 10:50.217
Remember: research,

10:50.427 --> 10:51.780
analyze and...

10:51.987 --> 10:53.056
...describe!

10:53.267 --> 10:54.746
Very nice.

10:58.547 --> 11:03.143
Mr Horson, you go with Glixen.
Mr Deanne, you go with Miss Bedworth.

11:05.307 --> 11:07.377
Let's get your learn on.

11:09.187 --> 11:11.576
So, checked out any
porno sites lately?

11:11.787 --> 11:13.851
I cannot believe I'm
stuck with you. Let's...

11:13.951 --> 11:15.746
hope I don't breathe
in any retard germs.

11:15.947 --> 11:19.223
Let's hope I don't get any
pencil neck virgin disease.

11:19.323 --> 11:19.986
Get stuffed.

11:20.507 --> 11:21.203
I hate you!

11:21.303 --> 11:24.182
It's because you secretly
want to have sex with me!

11:25.107 --> 11:27.257
When I do decide to surrender
the flower of my womanhood -

11:27.467 --> 11:29.662
I've always imagined it to be with
someone of my own species!

11:29.867 --> 11:32.664
There's is nobody else in your
species, except maybe Glixen.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.366
You're such a moron.
You really think...

11:34.466 --> 11:36.039
the world evolves around
rap music, football

11:36.139 --> 11:37.526
and hanging out with the right crowd?

11:37.626 --> 11:40.743
You know, you make me sick, you think
you are so different to everyone else.

11:40.946 --> 11:42.504
Different from.

11:42.706 --> 11:45.823
You said 'Different to'. The correct
phraseology is 'Different from'.

11:46.026 --> 11:48.255
Thanks for that information.
You're no different...

11:48.355 --> 11:50.497
from any other geek with
books instead of friends -

11:50.706 --> 11:52.936
and you don't have to open
your big fat mouth to correct me.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.023
- Neanderthal!
- Spaz.

11:55.746 --> 11:58.101
I should pity you but I can't.
I hate you too much.

11:58.306 --> 12:00.206
I rather cross my legs for
the rest of the night...

12:00.306 --> 12:01.901
for everybody than to
be anything like you!

12:03.346 --> 12:05.860
- Dito!
- 'Dito'?

12:06.986 --> 12:07.941
Double dito!

12:08.146 --> 12:10.819
Double double dito times a
thousand trillions!

12:34.545 --> 12:39.300
'... and forever more shall find
her destiny to live alone no more.'

12:42.265 --> 12:44.495
Good night, Mr. Fluffy.

13:27.544 --> 13:29.341
Oh God, my head...

13:30.344 --> 13:32.574
I must be dreaming. Time to wake up.

13:33.424 --> 13:34.743
What was that?

13:35.744 --> 13:37.017
Tits!

13:37.223 --> 13:40.181
I have tits. Two tits!

13:40.623 --> 13:44.662
This is the regular number of tits
but for a guy? What's going on here?

13:46.063 --> 13:47.655
Oh my god, it's gone!

13:52.663 --> 13:54.540
This looks bad. If it's
gone and I have tits -

13:56.263 --> 13:57.491
that means this must be a dream.

13:57.863 --> 14:00.980
A very very bad 'Now I have tits' dream.

14:06.583 --> 14:07.572
What is this?

14:09.903 --> 14:11.302
This isn't my room!

14:19.182 --> 14:20.661
We need to talk!

14:22.062 --> 14:24.815
Talk? She want's to talk?

14:25.902 --> 14:27.870
Let's talk about why I'm
going through a drawer...

14:27.970 --> 14:30.100
full of underwear with the
days of the week on them. !

14:31.182 --> 14:32.854
Oh God!

14:36.542 --> 14:39.420
OK, now my pubes knows it Wednesday!

14:46.742 --> 14:49.051
It's tough enough getting
these damn things off!

14:51.022 --> 14:54.173
How the hell does anyone
get these things on?

14:58.142 --> 15:01.656
Ladies, looks like you and
me is going au naturelle.

15:02.301 --> 15:04.735
Go away!

15:07.421 --> 15:09.218
Alright, coast is clear.

15:15.741 --> 15:17.459
Get off.

15:28.421 --> 15:30.093
Good morning!

15:30.781 --> 15:34.251
- Nell, is everything OK?
- I didn't see you there!

15:35.301 --> 15:37.974
- Your oatmeal is on the table.
- I'm in a hurry, gotta go.

15:38.181 --> 15:42.299
Nonsense, now you sit down, it's
the most important meal of the day.

15:42.501 --> 15:46.698
And oatmel is wonderful for promoting
healthy and regular bowel movements.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.653
That's cool if I want to take
a dump the size of my head.

15:49.980 --> 15:50.935
Excuse me?

15:52.460 --> 15:54.132
Oatmeal's good, mummy.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
<music>Deep Purple: Hush</music>

16:00.740 --> 16:02.731
Is this meat?

16:04.220 --> 16:07.451
- You have oatmeal?
- Are you shitting me?

16:09.780 --> 16:12.658
- Porkmeat's good.
- Eat up, son

16:25.779 --> 16:27.929
Jesus, I'm gonna puke.

16:40.579 --> 16:44.288
Golly, you must have been hungry.

16:44.499 --> 16:46.296
You need a second helping.
You wait there, young lady!

16:56.139 --> 16:57.970
How's it going, pretty boy?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.213
Let's go!

17:01.979 --> 17:05.130
It will turn you into
a big strong girl!

17:08.218 --> 17:10.015
Excuse me.

17:11.778 --> 17:13.257
See you later.

17:13.458 --> 17:16.814
Nell, aren't you forgetting something?

17:19.698 --> 17:23.088
Holy crap, look at the
size of that thing!

17:23.417 --> 17:25.010
What thing?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.448
Gotta go mom, see you later.

17:30.258 --> 17:34.615
Hop in man, we got places to go,
people to see, women to impregnate.

17:48.538 --> 17:49.653
You OK?

17:50.977 --> 17:52.171
Yeah, I'm fine!

17:53.257 --> 17:54.690
Really?

18:12.537 --> 18:15.097
The bitch stole my ride!

18:22.457 --> 18:25.688
- We're going a little fast?
- You bet your sweet ass we are!

18:26.457 --> 18:28.334
I am going to die!

18:33.816 --> 18:35.980
Oh god, I'm getting on
the bus. I haven't...

18:36.080 --> 18:37.570
been on the bus since 8th grade!

18:49.296 --> 18:51.048
Come on!

18:55.536 --> 18:57.686
Screw you assholes!

18:58.376 --> 19:00.890
That's no way for
a young lady to talk!

19:01.096 --> 19:04.850
Sorry, I'm a bitch when I'm on
the rag, you know what I'm saying?

19:11.776 --> 19:14.495
- Sorry!
- Yeah, you too.

19:16.775 --> 19:21.769
And this dress is just amazing

19:23.735 --> 19:25.134
You!

19:25.495 --> 19:27.631
What the hell have you
done to me, witch lady?

19:27.731 --> 19:29.249
Get your hands off me, you bully!

19:29.455 --> 19:31.084
God, you think I'm responsible for this?

19:31.184 --> 19:33.653
I certainly am not. And you're
the one who knows everything.

19:33.895 --> 19:36.409
That does not include this!

19:36.615 --> 19:41.370
This is impossible.
This can not happen!

19:44.215 --> 19:46.129
You better figure out how
to get my damn body back.

19:46.229 --> 19:47.810
Trust me, there's nothing
I would like more.

19:48.015 --> 19:50.768
You think I relish waking up
another day with the Simpsons?

19:50.975 --> 19:52.329
Leave my parents out of this.

19:52.429 --> 19:55.412
And what is up with your mother?
She never heard of volume control?

19:55.615 --> 19:58.686
Yak farmers in Tibet are praying
for her to keep the volume down.

19:58.894 --> 20:00.646
And her language, my goodness!

20:00.854 --> 20:03.971
My mother does not have a mole
on her face the size of the White House.

20:04.174 --> 20:06.254
So she's got a problem
with moles. Besides,

20:06.354 --> 20:08.008
it's not a mole, it's a beauty spot!

20:08.214 --> 20:11.729
I can spot that beauty from Wisconsin!

20:12.534 --> 20:14.490
Insensitive pig!

20:15.014 --> 20:18.927
I don't want to be a boy, OK?
Especially I don't want to be you!

20:20.374 --> 20:23.730
No, no, no, don't cry, not here.

20:24.254 --> 20:29.009
Maybe it's just one of those 24
hour things. Like a head cold.

20:29.734 --> 20:33.568
Tomorrow we could be back to normal.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.686
Just try not to attract
any unnecessary attention.

20:54.173 --> 20:56.733
Gross, I have to touch it? Ewww!

20:59.853 --> 21:03.812
I will never eat finger food from a
buffet again for as long as I live.

21:10.373 --> 21:14.651
Your homework was to prepare a
speech on the greatest living American.

21:16.933 --> 21:19.087
I'm sorry I missed it
but I was excused...

21:19.187 --> 21:21.290
from homework due to
cheerleading practice.

21:21.652 --> 21:22.880
I see. And Nell?

21:27.412 --> 21:28.367
What?

21:28.572 --> 21:31.848
Your speech please. On the
greatest living American?

21:40.772 --> 21:45.129
I think the greatest
living American is...

21:48.572 --> 21:49.891
...J-Lo.

21:51.860 --> 21:53.604
- J-Lo?
- You know, Jennifer Lopez?

21:53.812 --> 21:59.648
Singer, movie star. She had a thing
with that dude from 'Pearl Harbor'.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.127
I know who J-Lo is now.

22:02.332 --> 22:05.310
I am just very interested
to hear what you...

22:05.410 --> 22:08.725
perceive qualifies her for
such a unique accolade.

22:10.251 --> 22:13.129
The thing about J-Lo is that...

22:13.331 --> 22:15.128
...she's from the streets..

22:16.011 --> 22:20.607
And now she's like this big movie
star and... she's still really cool.

22:21.571 --> 22:24.483
She used to have a little,
now she's got a lot.

22:24.691 --> 22:28.923
But she's still J-Lo from the block.
And I think that's pretty damn great.

22:30.251 --> 22:35.006
And she's American.
And she's a wife.

22:36.571 --> 22:37.890
I see.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.363
J-Lo?

22:44.571 --> 22:49.485
Pretty good, huh? It just
flew right into my head.

22:49.850 --> 22:51.920
At least there's plenty
of space for it to land.

22:52.130 --> 22:55.805
What is your problem? I happen to
like J-Lo! She's a hot booty!

22:56.010 --> 22:58.156
You do not bestow an
honor such as 'Greatest

22:58.256 --> 23:00.640
Living American' solely on
the fact of a hot booty!

23:00.850 --> 23:04.923
I didn't! She also happen to
have a terrific set of funbags!

23:05.930 --> 23:08.524
Woody Deanne, you're
an idiot and a Philistine.

23:08.730 --> 23:12.279
Know what, I don't appreciate
you calling me an idiot.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.139
And I don't know what
that other thing is...

23:14.239 --> 23:15.926
but as sure as hell
ain't one of them either.

23:26.410 --> 23:28.798
Hey Woody!

23:30.609 --> 23:34.045
What a lovely sight.
Swill time at Getty Central.

23:36.569 --> 23:39.959
Dear God, now I have to eat
with these creatures?

23:43.649 --> 23:45.680
My parents are going
out tonight, maybe you...

23:45.780 --> 23:47.725
wanna come over to discuss
what you wanna wear

23:47.825 --> 23:48.909
for the homecoming dance?

23:49.009 --> 23:51.204
I have things to do.

23:51.409 --> 23:55.448
What I meant was: we'd be alone.

23:56.169 --> 23:58.603
So maybe I might do
that thing when I...

24:04.489 --> 24:08.243
- You filthy little slut!
- You do that?

24:11.888 --> 24:13.560
Last week he begged me to do that!

24:15.288 --> 24:19.361
- So what is it, what do you do?
- Get lost, you little spastic.

24:22.168 --> 24:25.843
I can not believe Woody turned down
the chance to have sex with me tonight!

24:26.088 --> 24:28.443
Am I in like bizarro world?

24:28.688 --> 24:31.325
If I had Richard Wainwright
sniffing around me,

24:31.425 --> 24:33.318
I wouldn't waste my time on Woody.

24:33.608 --> 24:34.802
It's not that simple Tiffany.

24:35.008 --> 24:38.444
Today football captain,
tomorrow GQ Man of the Year.

24:38.688 --> 24:41.725
You need to plan these things!

24:41.928 --> 24:43.606
Personally I'd be relived if Horse and

24:43.706 --> 24:45.427
I didn't have sex.
Sometimes I think it's

24:45.527 --> 24:46.748
the only reason he's with me.

24:46.848 --> 24:50.808
That is so not true Chanel.
You have many fine qualities.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.081
Really? Like what?

24:53.847 --> 24:55.917
You have excellent taste in earrings.

24:56.847 --> 24:59.520
And your hair looks really good.

25:02.287 --> 25:04.801
And you're friends
with me. Case closed.

25:12.887 --> 25:16.641
- Woodster! Come on in, my man.
- How are you?

25:16.847 --> 25:19.361
Cool as frozen shit, homie.

25:19.967 --> 25:22.435
Yo, we have extra practice tonight,
alright, don't forget!

25:24.607 --> 25:26.802
I'm in the mood to
kick some serious ass!

25:27.007 --> 25:28.406
Oh yeah, me too!

25:28.607 --> 25:31.406
...only I have a prior
engagement that...

25:31.506 --> 25:34.443
conflicts with the
whole ass kicking thing.

25:34.847 --> 25:36.916
Wait, we're a week away
from the game against Lamont.

25:37.126 --> 25:40.562
Do you know what the coach will do to
your nuts if you don't show up tonight?

25:40.766 --> 25:44.600
No, I'll tell you. He will
grind them into dust.

25:45.486 --> 25:46.635
Nut dust.

25:46.846 --> 25:50.839
And the only kids you'd be able to have
is the itsy-bitsy patter ones.

26:27.165 --> 26:28.644
Alright, here we go!

26:29.965 --> 26:31.080
Wood?

26:32.045 --> 26:33.637
Cut the ball, man!

26:40.125 --> 26:42.559
- Woody?
- Sorry, coach.

26:46.245 --> 26:48.076
Alright, let's get this.

26:50.925 --> 26:51.960
Go!

26:56.045 --> 26:58.320
- Wood man, come on!
- Wake up, boy!

26:59.365 --> 27:00.353
Sorry, coach.

27:05.444 --> 27:06.843
I got it!

27:14.244 --> 27:17.520
What the hell were you doing out
there? You play like a damn woman!

27:17.724 --> 27:19.203
I'm a little pique.

27:20.044 --> 27:23.275
- It means off colour.
- I know what 'picque' means!

27:23.484 --> 27:25.600
You listen to me, and you listen good!

27:26.044 --> 27:28.922
This homecoming game is gonna be
the biggest game in those boys' lives.

27:29.124 --> 27:31.720
You may have a god given talent but I...

27:31.820 --> 27:34.482
will not let you risk
it. Do you hear me?

27:35.524 --> 27:36.673
Yes, coach!

27:38.124 --> 27:40.088
You get your shit
together or you'll be...

27:40.188 --> 27:41.877
watching the game from the side lines!

27:46.003 --> 27:48.801
Don't let it bug you buddy,
just hang in there!

27:49.483 --> 27:52.634
Look, you just hit a slump,
just like a golfer.

27:52.843 --> 27:56.472
It doesn't matter how big you are,
every now and again you lose a swing.

27:56.683 --> 28:00.915
So you keep working on your strokes
and banging those balls.

28:02.643 --> 28:04.474
Do you wanna touch my helmet?

28:06.043 --> 28:08.662
My lucky helmet. It works
for me, maybe it'll...

28:08.762 --> 28:10.992
do you the same. Go
ahead, give it a rub!

28:21.000 --> 28:24.500
<music>Elton John: Candle
in the Wind</music>

28:31.882 --> 28:34.316
Oh man, this is crappy music!

28:45.562 --> 28:46.517
Loser!

28:46.722 --> 28:48.952
Yeah, you too and your mama!

28:54.522 --> 28:56.114
I heard about football practice.

28:56.322 --> 28:58.790
- Those boys are really rough.
- I'm covered in bruises.

28:59.002 --> 29:02.551
I don't care about your bruises.
If coach drops you my life is over.

29:02.762 --> 29:06.310
Why are you so worked up?
It's only a game!

29:06.641 --> 29:09.319
No, it's not only a
game. It's football!

29:09.419 --> 29:11.317
Jesus, don't you get anything?

29:11.521 --> 29:14.014
I get that clearly
this is not a head cold

29:14.114 --> 29:16.549
Do you have any better
theories, smart ass?

29:19.321 --> 29:21.437
Look at you. What am I wearing?

29:21.681 --> 29:24.195
Chinos and a Oxford cotton button-down
I found in the back of your closet.

29:24.401 --> 29:28.280
Which is exactly where
it is meant to stay!

29:29.201 --> 29:30.680
Nonsense, you can't
beat the classic look!

29:30.881 --> 29:32.579
My hair, you've made it all dorky!

29:32.679 --> 29:34.669
A center parting is
very European looking.

29:34.881 --> 29:36.328
No, it is very dorky looking!

29:36.428 --> 29:39.033
Excuse me for taking a little
pride in your appearance!

29:39.241 --> 29:42.995
You could have ruined my life,
I look like a male version of you!

29:43.441 --> 29:46.060
As long as I'm stuck
inside this disgusting...

29:46.160 --> 29:48.390
body, you'll just have
to put up with it!

29:49.200 --> 29:52.351
Alright, if that's how
you want it, sweet cheeks.

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
<music>Scissor Sisters:
Filthy / Gorgeous</music>

30:39.639 --> 30:41.277
Nice ass!

30:42.239 --> 30:44.992
You're looking fine, sugar!

30:45.359 --> 30:47.595
- What are you doing?
- Protecting your modesty.

30:47.695 --> 30:49.299
You look like a common prostitute!

30:49.399 --> 30:50.978
Damn, I was going for
a high class hooker!

30:51.078 --> 30:52.471
You can not walk into school like this!

30:52.679 --> 30:56.513
I can do whatever I want. Now get
your hands off me or I'll scream.

31:22.998 --> 31:26.513
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be Shakespeare.

31:34.078 --> 31:35.909
OK, here goes.

31:37.038 --> 31:38.915
Nice penis.

31:58.677 --> 32:01.555
Nothing like a bit of personal hygien.

32:11.517 --> 32:13.712
Well, it has to be done.

32:19.797 --> 32:21.628
Come on, think about it.

32:21.837 --> 32:24.351
And she's totally
pretending to be pretty.

32:26.757 --> 32:28.748
- Hello, Woody.
- Hello, Breanna.

32:28.957 --> 32:30.812
I have something I want to say to you.

32:30.912 --> 32:33.269
Let me guess: you're sorry
about blowing me off.

32:33.597 --> 32:36.555
No. I'm afraid we can't
see each other any more.

32:38.396 --> 32:40.068
Very funny, Woody.

32:40.276 --> 32:43.234
Well, I don't find you
that attractive any more.

32:43.716 --> 32:46.594
You just look kind of plain.

32:48.156 --> 32:50.989
And don't worry about your moustache.
Some guys are really into that shit.

32:53.076 --> 32:55.112
Suck on this, Woody Dean.

32:55.316 --> 32:56.954
I can't believe he said that to her!

32:57.156 --> 33:00.307
You can't really see the hairs anyway.

33:01.196 --> 33:02.311
What just happened?

33:02.516 --> 33:04.877
Seems you and your
girlfriend just broke up.

33:04.977 --> 33:05.713
Commiserations.

33:06.356 --> 33:07.514
No! Me and Breanna?

33:07.614 --> 33:10.269
Breanna and I, but let's
not quip over details.

33:11.836 --> 33:14.669
- Broke up with my girlfriend?
- You'll get over it.

33:16.156 --> 33:18.226
Wanna go for a ride?

33:18.636 --> 33:20.751
I have to go, tonight's
a big night for me.

33:22.075 --> 33:23.667
You too.

33:25.355 --> 33:29.314
Congratulations. Tonight's the night
you finally get to lose it.

33:33.275 --> 33:34.628
Nicky!

33:50.795 --> 33:51.989
There you go, babe.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.707
Thanks.

33:55.915 --> 33:57.633
Nice...

33:58.515 --> 34:00.870
- ... trailer.
- It's a dump.

34:01.075 --> 34:03.907
But... my folks are away...

34:04.634 --> 34:07.865
...and we won't be disturbed.

34:14.474 --> 34:16.704
Never seen a chick
drink like that before.

34:17.474 --> 34:20.670
My throat's a little dry.

34:23.194 --> 34:26.982
Maybe I could moisten it up a little.

34:29.994 --> 34:32.382
I can't. I need another beer.

34:34.154 --> 34:35.951
Sure.

34:44.873 --> 34:47.306
- You OK?
- I'm fine thank you.

34:47.513 --> 34:50.119
You've been acting
kind of weird lately.

34:50.219 --> 34:52.382
I think I know what's on your mind.

34:53.632 --> 34:56.226
- I don't think you do.
- Let me guess.

34:56.873 --> 35:00.017
You think if you don't
impress those scouts,

35:00.117 --> 35:02.913
you're gonna end up
working with your dad

35:03.013 --> 35:04.153
in spatula world.

35:04.633 --> 35:05.668
What?

35:06.233 --> 35:11.023
I ain't stupid, Woody. Just
let things fall into place.

35:11.793 --> 35:14.023
Whatever you do, we'll be proud of you.

35:17.873 --> 35:22.071
So you don't want to work
with spatulas, what the heck?

35:29.872 --> 35:31.271
Not here.

35:32.192 --> 35:34.262
OK, let's go to the master bedroom.

35:37.832 --> 35:41.541
Let's get cracking baby,
cause daddy's packing!

35:44.432 --> 35:47.469
Oh god, what was I
thinking? This is so gay!

35:49.632 --> 35:51.065
What are you waiting for, baby?

35:51.592 --> 35:54.026
Daddy wants to see some flesh.

35:54.272 --> 35:57.787
He's gonna make me his bitch!
Woody the bitch boy!

35:58.112 --> 36:00.865
Maybe you need a little help?

36:02.912 --> 36:04.391
I have to pee.

36:04.592 --> 36:05.263
Now?

36:05.472 --> 36:08.494
Yeah, I can feel I have
to fricking go. So, you...

36:08.594 --> 36:09.430
get undressed -

36:09.631 --> 36:11.861
and don't start without me.

36:19.231 --> 36:20.505
Hey, come back!

36:23.000 --> 36:27.166
<music>Elton John: Candle
in the Wind</music>

36:27.266 --> 36:29.381
Not this shit again, man!

36:30.471 --> 36:34.522
It's very melodic. If you give it a
chance you might learn to enjoy it.

36:34.622 --> 36:38.000
<music>Elton John: Candle
in the Wind</music>

36:38.111 --> 36:39.988
No. Still shit.

36:40.471 --> 36:42.382
Have you heard about
that grease ball Nicky?

36:43.631 --> 36:47.260
She got it on last night.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.462
Did you guys hear?

36:54.030 --> 36:56.828
She did it in the trailer park.

36:59.350 --> 37:02.501
She probably didn't even
know it was a trailer park.

37:11.310 --> 37:13.141
Woody, are you crying?

37:15.550 --> 37:17.222
What's wrong?

37:18.670 --> 37:20.467
I'm sorry.

37:20.870 --> 37:24.306
I just found out I lost my
virginity in a trailer park.

37:33.549 --> 37:37.462
I gotta go.
I got a class.

38:04.669 --> 38:06.978
Hey, do you think she
might do it with me?

38:07.549 --> 38:09.938
No! Get lost.

38:18.708 --> 38:19.697
What?

38:22.348 --> 38:26.387
Don't worry. You had a great time.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.657
Trust me, you'll never forget it.

38:29.948 --> 38:31.620
How could you do this to me?

38:33.348 --> 38:37.136
I know you're not the best looking
guy in the world but it's only sex.

38:37.868 --> 38:40.223
I wanted it to be special.

38:40.548 --> 38:44.939
Well, you started it.'A central
parting is very european looking'.

38:45.148 --> 38:46.342
You lost me my girlfriend.

38:46.548 --> 38:49.506
I was saving it for the
boy I fell in love with.

38:57.588 --> 38:59.862
Look, nothing happened, OK?

39:01.787 --> 39:03.778
- Really?
- Really.

39:05.987 --> 39:07.962
That's not what Nicky
is telling everyone.

39:08.062 --> 39:09.024
Well, Nicky is a liar.

39:10.147 --> 39:12.536
Try telling that to the entire world.

39:13.827 --> 39:16.660
How's it feel to be a cheap little slut?

39:20.747 --> 39:24.074
Looks like I have to have a talk with
that son of a bitch, cause no one...

39:24.174 --> 39:24.945
calls us the sort.

39:39.027 --> 39:40.379
Pass the ball!

39:42.306 --> 39:44.695
Nicky, here's your ho!

39:47.106 --> 39:49.779
- Hey, I'm looking for you!
- You found me, baby.

39:50.266 --> 39:52.257
What the hell did you say?

39:54.146 --> 39:55.181
Nothing.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.305
Oh really?

39:58.106 --> 40:00.574
But I wasn't 100 percent true.

40:01.826 --> 40:04.021
You greasy scumbag liar.

40:04.426 --> 40:07.259
And you've got a very
dirty little mouth.

40:08.426 --> 40:09.905
Then again...

40:10.866 --> 40:12.504
...I already knew that.

40:14.106 --> 40:16.461
- A little hellcat, ain't you?
- Asshole!

40:19.786 --> 40:21.777
That's no way to treat a lady, mister!

40:21.986 --> 40:24.897
And what kind of word is 'ain't you'.
It's wrong on so many levels.

40:25.185 --> 40:27.824
Why don't you tell everyone
what really happened?

40:28.025 --> 40:30.095
- Tell them!
- Nothing! Nothing happened!

40:30.305 --> 40:32.544
I think you owe this sweet, innocent,

40:32.644 --> 40:35.060
yet very attractive
young lady an apology.

40:37.025 --> 40:38.504
Sorry.

40:39.585 --> 40:41.177
I'm sorry!

40:42.385 --> 40:43.454
Thanks.

40:49.585 --> 40:52.895
It's so much fun to hit someone.
I'd like to punch him again.

40:56.105 --> 40:59.177
Easy champ. Doesn't mean I forgive you
about screwing up about Breanna and I.

40:59.785 --> 41:01.264
Breanna and me.

41:03.705 --> 41:04.932
I'll try to fix things.

41:05.144 --> 41:07.863
What's the point?
I'm a girl, remember?

41:09.224 --> 41:13.103
Jesus, what am I gonna do?
Homecoming's next Friday.

41:13.624 --> 41:15.376
My life is a complete disaster.

41:15.584 --> 41:17.646
What were we doing
before this happened?

41:17.746 --> 41:18.098
Arguing?

41:18.304 --> 41:20.579
- You always argue.
- Not always.

41:21.824 --> 41:23.815
We were at the museum.

41:24.304 --> 41:29.219
- In front of that ugly Mexican dude.
- Aztek. Texcatlipoca.

41:29.424 --> 41:33.133
- That's the guy.
- He's the ancient god of sorcery.

41:44.184 --> 41:45.856
We close in 5 minutes, folks.

41:55.103 --> 41:55.918
OK, you go first.

41:56.018 --> 41:58.015
No, you go first, you
have the biggest mouth.

41:59.463 --> 42:02.353
- Hi, how are you?
- Is that the best you can do?

42:02.453 --> 42:04.363
He's a god, not your aunt Betsy.

42:04.463 --> 42:07.283
You may have got the
impression that this...

42:07.383 --> 42:10.140
young fellow and I didn't
like it each other.

42:11.703 --> 42:14.536
But let me tell you, that could not
be any farther from the truth.

42:14.743 --> 42:19.100
That's right. Sure we were fighting
but all friends fight, right?

42:19.303 --> 42:25.378
How could you not like Nell? She is
really tidy and smart, way smart!

42:27.463 --> 42:30.579
Kinda cute, especially when she
does that thing with her nose.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.656
We get along really well.

42:33.662 --> 42:36.779
- Yeah, we're actually very close.
- Closest.

42:36.982 --> 42:38.210
Real homies.

42:38.422 --> 42:40.492
- To the end, bro.
- Don't overdo it.

42:43.542 --> 42:47.171
Now that we've got that cleared
up, here's what we're gonna do.

42:47.422 --> 42:49.378
We close our eyes, count to three -

42:49.582 --> 42:52.892
and when we open them up, we'll
be back in our right bodies.

42:53.382 --> 42:54.781
If that's OK with you -

42:54.982 --> 42:59.902
which I'm sure it is, since this
is just a big misunderstanding we can

43:00.002 --> 43:01.982
laugh about in years to come.

43:02.342 --> 43:03.570
Let's do it.

43:11.222 --> 43:12.290
One...

43:13.381 --> 43:14.894
...two...

43:15.421 --> 43:16.740
...three.

43:25.101 --> 43:27.092
Maybe he only speaks Mexican?

43:27.301 --> 43:29.974
So what are we gonna do next,
buy him an enchilada?

43:31.501 --> 43:33.696
I had my heart set on Yale.

43:34.381 --> 43:36.611
No, please, not the tears, please?

43:38.661 --> 43:41.129
You think I wanna end up
in my dad's spatula store?

43:41.341 --> 43:43.093
You don't know.

43:46.541 --> 43:47.735
Wait, wait!

43:49.181 --> 43:51.058
You beat up Nicky.

43:55.860 --> 43:58.932
You have my body, my strength.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.893
All I need to do is
show you how to use it.

44:05.420 --> 44:09.430
And we could study so you
could get through my interview.

44:09.530 --> 44:09.760
Huh?

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
<music>Orson: Tryin' to Help</music>

44:52.179 --> 44:53.294
Ready?

44:53.779 --> 44:55.929
As hard as you like.

45:00.019 --> 45:01.372
Come on.

45:17.739 --> 45:19.615
Once the sign is given -

45:19.818 --> 45:21.938
the center snaps the
ball to the quarterback...

45:22.038 --> 45:23.936
and the game begins.
Are you with me so far?

45:25.338 --> 45:26.851
The offence has a
limited amount of time...

45:27.058 --> 45:29.447
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

45:29.658 --> 45:32.616
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

45:32.818 --> 45:36.015
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May.

45:36.218 --> 45:39.130
And summer's lease hath
all too short a date.

45:39.698 --> 45:42.735
So, he's not actually
saying that she's like a...

45:42.835 --> 45:45.933
summer's day? He say she is
hot like a summer's day?

45:46.138 --> 45:47.969
Yeah, that's it exactly!

45:50.738 --> 45:52.688
Right, you know, I still
can't imagine ever...

45:52.788 --> 45:54.697
actually saying something
like that to someone.

45:55.498 --> 45:57.056
Feel like so uncool.

45:57.258 --> 45:58.922
Maybe you'd just have
to meet the right...

45:59.022 --> 46:00.374
person to say that kind of stuff to.

46:00.577 --> 46:03.489
Or maybe I just don't
wanna look like a doofus.

46:03.697 --> 46:07.372
Well, Shaky must really have liked that
one. She must have been some babe.

46:07.577 --> 46:09.886
Actually, Shakespeare
wrote this to a young man.

46:10.457 --> 46:13.449
- Shakespeare was a homo?
- We don't know that exactly.

46:13.697 --> 46:15.426
You write a poem to
a guy telling him...

46:15.526 --> 46:17.212
how hot he is and you
don't know exactly?

46:17.417 --> 46:20.056
Gees, what do you have to do
before you know exactly?

46:20.257 --> 46:22.817
Write an ode to a schlong?

46:23.217 --> 46:24.809
I think that's enough for today.

46:25.017 --> 46:27.929
The bard was a bender.
Who would've though?

46:28.417 --> 46:29.930
See you tomorrow.

46:30.337 --> 46:31.656
Good night.

46:38.497 --> 46:40.175
Listen, I was wrong about
your parents. They're...

46:40.275 --> 46:41.853
alright once you get used
to your mom's language.

46:42.057 --> 46:43.887
Mom's pretty cool.

46:46.656 --> 46:48.533
Woody, can I ask you a question?

46:50.216 --> 46:51.410
Sure.

46:53.496 --> 46:55.293
In the morning...

46:56.856 --> 46:58.448
- Never mind.
- What?

46:58.656 --> 47:00.487
- No, it's nothing really.
- Go on.

47:00.696 --> 47:02.607
It's a little embarrasing but...

47:02.816 --> 47:05.376
...every morning you...

47:07.096 --> 47:10.247
...have this thing....

47:12.296 --> 47:14.048
- The thing that you...
- What?

47:14.896 --> 47:17.410
You know, every morning?

47:20.416 --> 47:23.726
- You mean the old boner.
- That's not the word I would have used.

47:23.936 --> 47:25.388
Boy, do I miss that guy.

47:25.488 --> 47:29.134
I'm sure you do. What I'd like to
know: how can I get rid of it?

47:30.495 --> 47:31.974
Only one way I know of.

47:33.055 --> 47:35.250
That's disgusting...

47:35.655 --> 47:37.054
...and there's got to
be another way, right?

47:39.455 --> 47:42.891
Well, there is one thing that I
do in case of emergencies....

47:43.135 --> 47:46.093
...sort of lets the air out of the
old tire, if you know what I'm saying.

47:46.855 --> 47:51.406
First I close my eyes,
and I think of you.

47:54.135 --> 47:56.729
- Works every the time.
- Good night.

47:56.935 --> 47:58.209
See ya!

48:13.254 --> 48:17.247
- Hey, you want one?
- No, thanks.

48:19.174 --> 48:23.087
You've had it quiet up
there tonight. Are you OK?

48:24.254 --> 48:25.901
Yeah, I was just studying with Nell.

48:26.001 --> 48:28.452
Is that what you young people
are calling it these days?

48:28.854 --> 48:32.005
- Nell's not that kind of girl.
- I know.

48:32.494 --> 48:33.813
She's a good kid.

48:34.774 --> 48:37.950
You know, way back,
her dad Ted and I used...

48:38.050 --> 48:41.088
to hang out together.
He was a good guy, Ted.

48:41.774 --> 48:43.093
He still is.

48:44.894 --> 48:46.612
I mean, as far as I know.

48:47.494 --> 48:49.007
What ever happened between you two?

48:49.214 --> 48:54.287
Nell's mom, Katherine, I guess.
She didn't really approve.

48:55.693 --> 48:58.969
We weren't her kind of people.

49:00.813 --> 49:02.132
Good night, son.

49:03.133 --> 49:05.601
Good night, dad.

49:14.573 --> 49:16.484
Oh god, she's crying.

49:20.173 --> 49:21.572
Chanel?

49:22.933 --> 49:24.525
Are you OK?

49:26.413 --> 49:28.051
Oh crap...

49:31.572 --> 49:33.051
What's wrong?

49:33.412 --> 49:37.291
It's about Harry. He's
seeing some other girl.

49:38.132 --> 49:40.123
No, he wouldn't do that.

49:40.812 --> 49:44.566
Well, how come I saw him with
his tongue stuck down her throat.

49:45.972 --> 49:47.769
Did you see who it was?

49:48.092 --> 49:52.802
No, they were in his car. But I
saw what they were doing clear enough.

49:54.412 --> 49:57.404
Why are guys such jerks?

50:00.452 --> 50:04.968
Why am I asking you, you know less about
guys than anybody on the planet.

50:07.492 --> 50:08.641
I'm sorry.

50:08.852 --> 50:11.491
- I didn't mean that.
- You're right.

50:11.692 --> 50:13.807
What do I know about guys?

50:16.131 --> 50:20.010
I was so stupid. I know how Horse is.

50:21.571 --> 50:24.005
Why do you go out with them?

50:25.451 --> 50:29.967
Cause when I started at
Westdale I felt invisible.

50:30.171 --> 50:34.528
And then I started going out
with Horse and I became friends -

50:34.731 --> 50:37.105
with Breanna and
Tiffany and Woody and...

50:37.205 --> 50:39.805
everyone. And then people
started to notice me.

50:41.211 --> 50:43.281
And I liked that.

50:45.091 --> 50:49.004
So, I guess I'm just afraid
of feeling invisible again.

50:51.051 --> 50:55.044
You know I think that a lot more
people feel that way than you realize.

50:55.731 --> 50:57.402
You do.

50:58.090 --> 51:01.526
You go your own way no
matter what anyone thinks.

51:03.530 --> 51:05.646
I admire you, Nell.

51:12.770 --> 51:15.214
And this is Mr. Stinky,
you have to say hello.

51:15.314 --> 51:18.083
Why did you bring that pencil
neck to our sleepover?

51:20.170 --> 51:21.364
Nell's OK.

51:21.570 --> 51:24.164
She just wants to hang, right?

51:25.370 --> 51:28.009
Carey told me we're all
going in our jammies.

51:32.530 --> 51:35.090
I see you finally seen the
errors of your geekish ways?

51:35.370 --> 51:37.679
I have. This girl
just wants to have fun.

51:41.209 --> 51:43.325
OK. OK! Let's get to our PJ's!

51:47.929 --> 51:49.157
Oh man!

51:49.809 --> 51:52.403
Life is such a bitch.

51:55.969 --> 52:00.121
Lock target in 5 and will
you check out that ass!

52:00.769 --> 52:01.758
What about Chanel?

52:04.449 --> 52:05.404
No, don't see her.

52:05.609 --> 52:07.201
Think about it Harry -

52:07.409 --> 52:10.043
are you willing to betray
the love of a good...

52:10.143 --> 52:12.722
woman for the cheap thrill
of a one night stand?

52:17.489 --> 52:21.003
You crack me up, you know that boy.

52:21.208 --> 52:23.881
You were always into the
'faithful' but I'm the Horse -

52:24.088 --> 52:26.443
and Horse people knows of
no such boundaries. And plus -

52:26.648 --> 52:30.766
at night I'm a locked target

52:32.288 --> 52:36.076
You know what happens. A few drinks,
quality control goes out the window -

52:36.288 --> 52:38.053
and before you know
it, you're sucking...

52:38.153 --> 52:39.917
face with some swill
muncher from downtown.

52:40.128 --> 52:43.279
Or worse still. I end up here with you -

52:43.488 --> 52:46.082
drunk on some dark street
telling you I love you.

52:46.968 --> 52:49.641
And you know me doesn't
want that to happen, homie.

52:49.968 --> 52:51.879
Let's go to a party.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.734
<music>Sugababes: Red Dress</music>

52:54.834 --> 52:55.811
<music>Sugababes: Red Dress</music>

52:55.911 --> 52:57.151
So Breanna, you're not
seeing Woody anymore?

52:57.251 --> 52:57.668
That is so over.

52:57.768 --> 53:00.328
Such a shame. I mean, you
guys were the perfect couple.

53:01.088 --> 53:03.237
Duh. I was only seeing him
because he's the football captain.

53:04.087 --> 53:06.840
Without me, he's just another dumb
jock with his brains in his shorts.

53:07.047 --> 53:10.596
Which is convenient because not
much else is going on down there.

53:21.767 --> 53:24.235
Loser! Drink up, man!

53:27.000 --> 53:30.414
<music>Sugababes: Push
the Button</music>

53:30.514 --> 53:31.536
<music>Sugababes: Push
the Button</music>

53:31.636 --> 53:32.840
Manicure, pedicure, face
masks. Are we done yet?

53:34.167 --> 53:38.126
Nell, I couldn't help noticing that
you're a little on the hairy side.

53:41.727 --> 53:42.682
Down below.

53:44.007 --> 53:48.363
You've got sort of a
rainforest thing going on.

53:48.566 --> 53:51.558
You're not supposed to be bushy?

53:52.806 --> 53:55.639
´- We've all gone totally latino.
- Totally.

53:56.246 --> 53:57.201
Really?

53:57.406 --> 53:59.203
You should too.

53:59.846 --> 54:01.757
You know, we could do
it for you right now.

54:03.046 --> 54:04.684
Latino.

54:05.686 --> 54:07.517
What the hell, let's do it!

54:08.726 --> 54:10.921
OK girls, we've got a green
light on the Brazilian wax.

54:11.126 --> 54:13.560
Tiffany, bring me scissors
and depilatory strips.

54:13.766 --> 54:16.838
Chanel, I'm gonna need
towels and hot water.

54:17.046 --> 54:21.324
Nell, sit back, relax and do exactly...

54:30.405 --> 54:31.838
One more, give me one more!

54:37.725 --> 54:39.204
Bite down on this.

54:40.045 --> 54:41.637
On three. One...

54:41.925 --> 54:43.597
Maybe this is a bad idea.

54:46.525 --> 54:48.720
Did I say you I love you, man?

54:49.845 --> 54:51.801
I really do love you, man.

54:52.365 --> 54:56.074
You're like... my... twin brother.

54:57.485 --> 55:01.114
You're white but you're my twin brother.

55:05.725 --> 55:08.239
Man, this is some kind of brazilian.

55:11.124 --> 55:12.796
How are you feeling?

55:14.244 --> 55:15.916
A little better.

55:17.644 --> 55:20.556
- How much did you drink last night?
- I don't know.

55:20.804 --> 55:25.195
I just remember feeling unusually
happy and having a really good time -

55:25.404 --> 55:28.919
and then like somebody picked up
the room and started spinning it.

55:29.644 --> 55:31.043
I don't know, I'm an idiot.

55:31.244 --> 55:35.522
Think of it as a rite of passage.
Go easy next time.

55:37.924 --> 55:39.357
Thanks for taking care of me.

55:44.404 --> 55:46.719
See you after lunch. We
have stuff to do today.

55:46.819 --> 55:47.396
Yeah, I know.

55:50.844 --> 55:54.597
Drop back, pump it and
then throw the ball.

55:56.443 --> 55:57.956
Alright, I can do that.

56:01.723 --> 56:03.156
No, you're telegraphing,
you're way telegraphing.

56:03.363 --> 56:05.399
Watch me behind me how I do.

56:08.843 --> 56:10.799
- What is it?
- What's what?

56:11.203 --> 56:13.592
That's sticking me in my ass.

56:15.003 --> 56:16.595
We're meant to be playing football.

56:16.803 --> 56:20.318
It's not my fault. I'm sorry.
It's your thing, not mine.

56:20.523 --> 56:21.691
Yeah, but you're behind the wheel.

56:21.791 --> 56:23.162
I guess that means you
find me attractive.

56:23.363 --> 56:26.400
No actually, that means
you find me attractive.

56:26.603 --> 56:29.037
Let's not read too much into it, OK.
This thing finds anything attractive.

56:29.243 --> 56:31.000
That is such a guy thing to say.

56:31.100 --> 56:33.282
Can we just keep playing
football, please?

56:33.963 --> 56:36.522
Sure, as long as you keep
my dick out of your butt.

57:10.642 --> 57:13.361
Ah, came through the windows!

57:13.642 --> 57:16.439
One of the many skills
I've acquired lately.

57:17.001 --> 57:19.004
Keep our voices down. If my mom knows

57:19.104 --> 57:21.791
I have a boy in my room
she'd spontaneously combust.

57:22.001 --> 57:24.276
I'm trying to settle what
to wear for your interview.

57:24.481 --> 57:26.790
Navy suit, white blouse
and sensible shoes.

57:27.001 --> 57:28.992
You don't think something
a little hotter?

57:29.641 --> 57:31.597
It's an interview...

57:34.241 --> 57:38.200
´- You're joking.
- At least something I can control.

57:39.481 --> 57:43.076
I've been thinking.
While we're like this -

57:43.281 --> 57:44.879
I wonder if it would make sense if...

57:44.979 --> 57:46.830
we could go to the
Homecoming dance together.

57:47.041 --> 57:50.917
Not only because, well, who else
would we go with? I don't wanna get

57:51.017 --> 57:52.901
stuck with pencil neck all night.

57:53.001 --> 57:55.469
It wouldn't be a date.

57:58.361 --> 58:01.750
- I'd like that.
- Great. It's a date.

58:02.320 --> 58:04.436
A non-date date.

58:04.640 --> 58:07.234
Nell, wash hands! Dinner!

58:07.440 --> 58:09.351
My cue to go.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.678
Not a real date.

58:17.240 --> 58:19.037
It's alright! I'm OK!

58:23.800 --> 58:25.518
I will be kinda late tomorrow.

58:26.560 --> 58:28.790
Kind of.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.991
Kind of late tomorrow.

58:34.080 --> 58:36.389
What is with you at the moment? Ted?

58:37.200 --> 58:39.714
Sometimes I feel as though I
don't know who you are anymore.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.354
She's growing up, Katherine.

58:46.159 --> 58:50.755
So, are you going to tell me
what you're doing or is it a secret?

58:51.799 --> 58:54.233
It's no secret, I'm
studying with Woody.

58:54.599 --> 58:55.554
Again?

58:55.879 --> 58:57.392
Yeah, you've got a problem with that?

59:04.159 --> 59:06.912
If you want to waste your
valuable time it's your affair.

59:07.119 --> 59:08.632
Who says I'm wasting my time?

59:09.959 --> 59:11.472
Oh Nell, you only have
to look at the boy.

59:12.039 --> 59:13.188
What's wrong with him?

59:13.399 --> 59:15.833
He's stupid, he's
trouble and he's a loser.

59:16.399 --> 59:17.673
You told me so yourself.

59:20.759 --> 59:24.194
There's nothing you can do to
change that. Look at his family.

59:24.478 --> 59:26.628
That's basic genetics.

59:48.878 --> 59:51.438
Hi, Mr Bedworth.

59:52.798 --> 59:54.550
Is Nell around?

59:55.318 --> 59:58.284
She's gone back to
school, son, she said...

59:58.384 --> 01:00:01.148
she had to do some
extra studying. She has

01:00:01.248 --> 01:00:03.508
her interview with Yale tomorrow.

01:00:03.798 --> 01:00:05.117
Thanks.

01:00:07.917 --> 01:00:11.592
- So, how have you been, Mr. Bedworth?
- I'm fine, Woody, just fine.

01:00:14.557 --> 01:00:18.345
- Well, give my best to your wife.
- I will do.

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:34.669
What are you trying to do?

01:00:40.917 --> 01:00:43.636
- Stop, you're gonna hurt yourself!
- Back off!

01:00:45.997 --> 01:00:47.907
Why are you doing this?

01:00:50.356 --> 01:00:52.790
Because this is who I am.

01:00:55.076 --> 01:00:57.590
This is all I've ever been.

01:00:59.836 --> 01:01:01.986
And now not even that.

01:01:06.316 --> 01:01:09.114
Football's not who you are.

01:01:10.516 --> 01:01:12.552
You don't get it, do you?

01:01:12.796 --> 01:01:15.390
- People like you never do.
- People like me?

01:01:15.596 --> 01:01:18.108
What exactly is it people
like me don't get?

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:19.032
People like me!

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.951
Then educate me, please!

01:01:28.356 --> 01:01:30.471
We like to play ball.

01:01:31.515 --> 01:01:33.506
Maybe we're even pretty good at it.

01:01:33.715 --> 01:01:37.708
Maybe we get accepted to some
second rate shit kicker college -

01:01:37.915 --> 01:01:43.035
or maybe we go work with our dad
at the spatula store. Who knows?

01:01:43.715 --> 01:01:48.266
But what we don't get is a great job,
a big apartment in the city -

01:01:48.475 --> 01:01:50.085
and a Yale education.

01:01:50.185 --> 01:01:53.310
So that's what this is
about. The interview?

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:01.192
I don't know!

01:02:01.795 --> 01:02:06.152
- It's OK to be nervous.
- Nothing is OK. Nothing!

01:02:07.915 --> 01:02:11.510
Tomorrow I'm supposed to be playing
the most important game of my life.

01:02:11.715 --> 01:02:15.024
This is my destiny. Mine!

01:02:16.234 --> 01:02:19.431
I'm not supposed to be
attending some college interwiew.

01:02:19.634 --> 01:02:24.628
So we got the wrong lives. Sometimes
you just gotta get on with life.

01:02:25.394 --> 01:02:27.430
Let things fall into place.

01:02:30.434 --> 01:02:31.867
Do me a favour.

01:02:32.314 --> 01:02:36.910
Save your inspirational speeches
for someone who gives a damn.

01:02:37.114 --> 01:02:38.706
I know who I am.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:43.866
I'm a loser, I'm trouble and
I'm stupid. Basic genetics.

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:45.873
Can't help it.

01:02:48.794 --> 01:02:52.867
Funny. I never took you for a quitter.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
<music>Fefe Dobson: Be Strong</music>

01:03:57.672 --> 01:03:59.310
You can go in.

01:04:05.832 --> 01:04:07.151
Miss Bedworth?

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:11.384
Please take a seat.

01:04:14.712 --> 01:04:18.989
One of the qualities we hope for in
any of our students is their passion.

01:04:20.191 --> 01:04:23.706
Your turn papers and test
results are exemplary.

01:04:23.911 --> 01:04:27.352
But your love and
knowledge of literature...

01:04:27.452 --> 01:04:30.100
is rare in a person of your years.

01:04:32.871 --> 01:04:35.465
Thank you, but it's an
important part of my life.

01:04:37.231 --> 01:04:39.142
Go on.

01:04:41.271 --> 01:04:44.502
Poetry, for instance -

01:04:45.591 --> 01:04:49.061
I like the way that it can
articulate and express feelings -

01:04:49.271 --> 01:04:53.059
complicated and difficult feelings
that you can't express literally.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:03.146
What about modern literature?

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:08.419
Are there any contemporary writers
and poets you particularly admire?

01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:13.664
No. Not really.

01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:17.827
Oh. Why is that?

01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:21.061
Because they suck?

01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:27.709
Welcome everybody to Homecoming,
the biggest game of the year.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:30.784
Surely if poetry is
no longer relevant -

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:35.063
poets and their art form
are doomed to extincition.

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:45.541
I think that will be all.

01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:04.577
Actually, I do like some modern poets.

01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:07.179
In fact I love them.

01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:11.427
50 Cent, Pete Pablo, Marshal Mathers.

01:06:11.629 --> 01:06:13.643
I don't think I'm
familiar with their works.

01:06:13.743 --> 01:06:14.860
Well, they're rap artists.

01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:16.980
And you consider that to be poetry?

01:06:17.189 --> 01:06:19.657
Absolutely. It's urban poetry, sir.

01:06:19.869 --> 01:06:24.260
They talk about their lives and
experiences. They can be very brutal -

01:06:24.469 --> 01:06:29.667
but often under a coat of humour.
Dark humour. Here, check it out.

01:06:31.188 --> 01:06:34.863
Applauds for the home theme.
The Westdale Bay Beavers!

01:06:36.668 --> 01:06:38.863
That's my boy!

01:06:39.348 --> 01:06:40.781
Applauds for the
quarterback, Woody Deanne!

01:06:40.881 --> 01:06:41.259
Woody Deanne!

01:06:41.468 --> 01:06:43.902
That's my boy!

01:06:47.228 --> 01:06:48.627
Wait!

01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:06.460
Here we go!

01:07:12.427 --> 01:07:16.386
Number 83, Johnny Chancer.

01:07:32.827 --> 01:07:36.103
Hey you, leave him alone or
I'll sock you around!

01:07:50.826 --> 01:07:54.023
Touchdown for The Razorbacks, folks!

01:08:15.586 --> 01:08:18.497
Touchdown for The Razorbacks.

01:08:18.706 --> 01:08:22.255
As they take the lead, 14-0,
early in the fourth quarter.

01:08:22.466 --> 01:08:26.903
There's still time folks, as Woody
Deanne takes the play.

01:08:45.545 --> 01:08:49.332
12th yard loss. This is
really unusual, folks.

01:08:51.225 --> 01:08:53.580
You just messed with the wrong girl.

01:08:57.705 --> 01:09:00.377
Hi Nell. I didn't know
football was your bag.

01:09:00.585 --> 01:09:03.179
I just came to cheer the team.

01:09:03.944 --> 01:09:06.015
We're not doing too good.

01:09:14.064 --> 01:09:18.136
That's my boy! He's my boy!

01:09:27.464 --> 01:09:31.821
Touchdown for The
Beavers by Harry the Horse!

01:09:33.384 --> 01:09:36.819
- Sit your fat arse down!
- Point taken, my good woman.

01:09:39.104 --> 01:09:41.572
- Do you want some of the dog?
- Yeah, thanks.

01:09:44.304 --> 01:09:45.862
Thanks, dad.

01:10:01.343 --> 01:10:04.176
This is it, folks.
Only 5 seconds to go.

01:10:04.543 --> 01:10:08.252
Time for one more play. This is
make or break for The Beavers.

01:10:13.303 --> 01:10:14.577
Ready?

01:10:26.463 --> 01:10:27.532
That's it, girl!

01:10:39.222 --> 01:10:40.860
Touchdown!

01:10:41.062 --> 01:10:44.293
The Westdale Beavers wins
at the very last moment!

01:10:44.502 --> 01:10:49.371
It's a touchdown by Woody
Deanne and The Beavers wins!

01:11:02.942 --> 01:11:05.058
What are you waiting here for?

01:11:10.302 --> 01:11:13.533
Woody! You're the man!

01:11:15.542 --> 01:11:16.816
Thanks.

01:11:17.382 --> 01:11:19.498
Great game, son.

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:22.926
- Decided for a college yet?
- I've had my heart set on Yale

01:11:23.026 --> 01:11:24.401
since I was a little girl.

01:11:24.501 --> 01:11:27.732
That's funny. You know what,
get your parents to give me call.

01:11:28.221 --> 01:11:31.054
We're not Yale, but I think you
might like what we have to offer.

01:11:31.581 --> 01:11:34.379
- Thank you so much.
- No problem. Great game.

01:11:41.261 --> 01:11:44.492
You did it! You were great!

01:11:45.221 --> 01:11:47.576
Did you see me out there?
I totally kicked ass!

01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:50.534
And the guy back here, he
was a scout. He gave me his card.

01:11:51.461 --> 01:11:55.136
- You're going to college. No spatulas.
- I saw.

01:11:56.581 --> 01:11:59.334
You know what the best part is?
I totally loved it!

01:12:00.021 --> 01:12:03.411
Your adrenaline gets pumping and
the crowd was totally into it.

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:10.370
The interview? Oh my god,
I totally forgot it.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:12.215
How was it?

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.377
It was amazing.

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:17.977
I mean, the place was.

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:21.968
For a moment I really
felt like part of it.

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.978
I gave my best shot.

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.178
I'm sure you did.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.571
And that's all anyone can ask.

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:37.257
And I tell you something.
They would be lucky -

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:41.335
to have someone like you. Thank you.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.458
Dito.

01:12:46.139 --> 01:12:50.052
You know, if I have to spend
my life as someone else -

01:12:51.179 --> 01:12:53.056
I'd be honoured to be you.

01:12:55.499 --> 01:12:56.818
Dito back at you.

01:12:58.019 --> 01:13:00.328
Double double dito.

01:13:23.059 --> 01:13:24.492
Woody?

01:13:26.019 --> 01:13:29.693
- Hey guys, I'm back!
- What are you talking about, 'back'?

01:13:35.298 --> 01:13:39.257
Hey there, Mr. Football hero.
Am I attractive enough for you now?

01:13:59.098 --> 01:14:01.035
Please Mrs. Bedworth,
I need to speak to Nell.

01:14:01.135 --> 01:14:02.534
She doesn't wish to speak with you.

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:03.887
I have to talk to her!

01:14:04.098 --> 01:14:06.094
She isn't going to the dance, Woody,

01:14:06.194 --> 01:14:08.728
but she did say she hopes
you have a good time -

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:10.815
with Breanna Bailey.

01:14:13.657 --> 01:14:17.013
For just one moment, Woody,
I thought you had changed.

01:14:24.537 --> 01:14:28.325
Come on honey, why the sad face?

01:14:30.457 --> 01:14:32.095
You got everything we ever wanted.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
<music>Dance Yourself to Death:
Life, Not Living</music>

01:14:55.976 --> 01:14:59.366
Oh my god! Look at that dress!

01:15:14.896 --> 01:15:16.375
So, do you like my dress?

01:15:18.176 --> 01:15:21.486
- Yeah, you look nice, Breanna.
- It's so tight, it shows everything.

01:15:23.136 --> 01:15:25.127
I had to leave my panties off.

01:15:25.816 --> 01:15:27.966
Let's hope you don't
get diarrhoea then.

01:15:28.456 --> 01:15:30.526
I'm gonna get some punch.

01:15:35.735 --> 01:15:36.929
Harry?

01:15:37.695 --> 01:15:38.969
Do you like my dress?

01:15:39.455 --> 01:15:40.808
Yeah baby, it looks good on you.

01:15:56.215 --> 01:15:57.101
I am so nervous?

01:15:57.201 --> 01:15:59.491
Are you kidding me?
You've got this in a bag.

01:16:01.015 --> 01:16:03.165
Check the make-up? We won't be a minute.

01:16:03.375 --> 01:16:06.208
Woody, straighten your
tie. Photographers!

01:16:12.335 --> 01:16:15.452
You know, seeing you in that tuxedo
is making me feel kinda horny.

01:16:16.975 --> 01:16:20.171
- Let's do it in the bushes!
- Serious?

01:16:20.614 --> 01:16:23.447
Yeah, it'd be like
doing it with James Bond.

01:16:23.774 --> 01:16:28.404
You know me: 009/2. License to thrill!

01:16:33.654 --> 01:16:34.609
Woody, wait!

01:16:35.614 --> 01:16:39.368
You wait over there, then
I'll walk by like Halle Berry -

01:16:39.574 --> 01:16:42.042
and then you jump up and grab me.

01:16:42.254 --> 01:16:44.085
Not a minute to miss.

01:17:00.213 --> 01:17:02.044
Ready when you are baby!

01:17:02.613 --> 01:17:04.524
Come and get me!

01:17:04.733 --> 01:17:06.371
Chanel?

01:17:12.293 --> 01:17:13.965
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

01:17:19.533 --> 01:17:21.330
Halle Berry wouldn't have done that.

01:17:22.293 --> 01:17:25.569
Good evening, Westdale Bay!

01:17:26.173 --> 01:17:30.052
And the presentation of the
crowns of this year's...

01:17:39.093 --> 01:17:40.606
Hi, princess.

01:17:43.532 --> 01:17:45.568
So you're not going to the dance?

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:51.004
Does it have anything to do with Woody?

01:17:57.492 --> 01:17:58.845
Maybe.

01:18:00.812 --> 01:18:02.689
He likes someone else.

01:18:03.932 --> 01:18:06.002
But is she a princess?

01:18:07.972 --> 01:18:10.611
Anytime soon she'll be a queen.

01:18:10.892 --> 01:18:14.362
No contest. Princesses
are younger and prettier -

01:18:14.572 --> 01:18:16.642
especially when they're my daughter.

01:18:21.452 --> 01:18:23.363
You really like him, don't you?

01:18:27.331 --> 01:18:28.605
Me too.

01:18:29.731 --> 01:18:32.086
I think he's a good one.

01:18:32.811 --> 01:18:34.085
I think you should go.

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:44.404
But I don't have anything to wear.

01:18:46.051 --> 01:18:48.121
Just a...

01:18:54.571 --> 01:18:56.759
Now, I'm not usually known
for my taste in fashion...

01:18:56.859 --> 01:18:58.962
but the young lady in the
store said it was 'dope'.

01:18:59.171 --> 01:19:01.162
I have no idea what
that means of course.

01:19:05.171 --> 01:19:06.808
It's beautiful.

01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:13.728
She said you need these too.
Apparently these are heavy.

01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:17.248
For all I know they
could be dope as well.

01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:21.369
Thank you!

01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:25.844
And the title of Westdale
Bay High Homecoming King -

01:19:26.210 --> 01:19:27.563
goes to -

01:19:29.050 --> 01:19:32.565
our very own footballing
hero, Woody Deanne!

01:19:49.889 --> 01:19:52.562
And now for the biggie -

01:19:52.769 --> 01:19:57.843
this year's Westdale
Bay Homecoming Queen is -

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:02.526
Breanna Bailey.

01:20:13.889 --> 01:20:17.598
Thank you, Miss Bidermeyer.
Principal Johnson.

01:20:18.009 --> 01:20:20.318
And thank you, Westdale Bay!

01:20:20.729 --> 01:20:24.005
There are so many people that I
need to share this great honour with.

01:20:24.209 --> 01:20:26.219
My mother whose undying support and...

01:20:26.319 --> 01:20:28.600
generous attitude
towards cosmetic surgery.

01:20:28.809 --> 01:20:30.844
My hair dresser, Georgio Theodopolous -

01:20:31.048 --> 01:20:33.861
Thank you, Breanna.
Another round of...

01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:37.123
applauds please for
Homecoming King and Queen!

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
<music>Ozzy Osbourne:
Goodbye to Romance</music>

01:21:33.807 --> 01:21:36.776
Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

01:21:36.876 --> 01:21:39.404
Thou art more lovely and temperate.

01:21:40.847 --> 01:21:45.477
Rough winds bla bla bla something. Can't
remember. Yada yada yada.

01:21:48.887 --> 01:21:50.320
It's alright.

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.398
I'm no Shakespeare -

01:21:54.887 --> 01:21:57.764
my guess is Romeo wasn't much
of a quarterback, either, right?

01:21:58.966 --> 01:22:00.951
I really wish I had
the most perfect and...

01:22:01.051 --> 01:22:03.084
beautiful words in the
world to say to you -

01:22:03.286 --> 01:22:05.532
cause if I did I'd say them but...

01:22:05.632 --> 01:22:08.963
I'd say how great you make
me feel when I'm with you.

01:22:09.846 --> 01:22:13.964
And how I love that little thing you
do with your nose when you smile.

01:22:15.166 --> 01:22:18.044
How you always correct my
stupid grammar. I hate it.

01:22:18.926 --> 01:22:20.359
But most of all -

01:22:21.206 --> 01:22:26.519
I'd tell you that... you
make me a better person.

01:22:29.366 --> 01:22:30.924
My own person.

01:22:32.686 --> 01:22:35.883
And that's why I know
that this means nothing.

01:22:39.485 --> 01:22:42.158
And you mean everything.

01:22:45.045 --> 01:22:47.036
But hey, I'm just a stupid quarterback.

01:22:48.325 --> 01:22:50.077
I don't know the right words.

01:22:51.725 --> 01:22:54.000
Those were lovely words.

01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:57.116
Perfect words.

01:22:57.685 --> 01:22:59.516
Come here, dumb jock.

01:22:59.965 --> 01:23:02.001
Don't try to stop me, pencil neck.

01:23:05.445 --> 01:23:06.844
Stop that!

01:23:07.725 --> 01:23:09.556
I'm the Homecoming Queen.

01:23:10.205 --> 01:23:11.684
Let's get out of here.

01:23:14.005 --> 01:23:17.475
- I'm the Homecoming Queen.
- And you're a bitch!

01:23:18.685 --> 01:23:20.754
Nice ass, baby! How
about a little swirl?

<music>Girls Aloud: I Think

01:23:42.724 --> 01:23:45.796
Did I miss this? Did Woody Deanne win?

01:23:51.644 --> 01:23:53.919
Sweet lord!

01:24:09.883 --> 01:24:11.635
So, how are we gonna do this?

01:24:12.603 --> 01:24:15.481
You're going to your chicken
shit college and me going to Yale.

01:24:18.963 --> 01:24:23.400
You did it. It came this morning.
Congratulations!

01:24:24.123 --> 01:24:26.079
You got in?

01:24:27.523 --> 01:24:29.002
Oh my god, I did it!

01:24:29.203 --> 01:24:32.275
Me and you did really good, huh?

01:24:33.203 --> 01:24:34.158
You and me.

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:36.556
Or -

01:24:36.883 --> 01:24:38.032
I?

01:24:38.243 --> 01:24:40.677
Will you just kiss me already?

01:24:41.283 --> 01:24:43.035
Yes, mam.

You can not be serious? A year of
sabbatical? We're talking about Yale -

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:29.355
for heavens sake, Yale!

01:25:31.201 --> 01:25:33.920
I know mum. But what the heck?

If I may quote Snoop Dog:

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.358
Let's get it started!

See what I'm saying?

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.674
Actually, I'm not sure
if this is Snoop -

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:28.431
it could be One Eyed Peas or 38 Cents.

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.750
I'm down with it anyway, bitch.
