00:39.627 --> 00:42.296
Richard, you're dressed.

00:42.316 --> 00:43.564
Well, it is morning, isn't it?

00:43.598 --> 00:45.532
Well,
it's just that ever since you were banned

00:45.567 --> 00:47.601
from working cases with Katherine,

00:47.635 --> 00:50.871
you and your pajamas have seen
an awful lot of each other.

00:50.905 --> 00:52.472
I think you're exaggerating.

00:52.506 --> 00:55.943
I admit I've taken the
occasional day off to recharge,

00:55.977 --> 00:57.743
but I hardly think it's fair.

00:57.778 --> 00:58.811
Wow. Castle, you're dressed?

00:58.845 --> 01:00.269
Yes, I'm dressed.

01:00.289 --> 01:02.648
I did not think it would be such an event.

01:02.683 --> 01:03.849
Good morning, babe.

01:03.884 --> 01:06.553
Does this mean you have something
special planned for today?

01:06.587 --> 01:08.488
As a matter of fact,
I do have something special lined up...

01:08.522 --> 01:10.957
a surprise, actually, for you.

01:10.991 --> 01:13.460
Really? What kind of a surprise?

01:13.494 --> 01:15.628
Well, now, if I told you that,
it wouldn't be a surprise.

01:15.662 --> 01:17.396
But trust me, you're gonna love it.

01:17.430 --> 01:18.731
Okay, now, why does that scare me?

01:18.765 --> 01:20.466
Because you're smart.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.301
Hmm. Come on, Castle... spill.

01:22.335 --> 01:23.903
A master interrogator like yourself,

01:23.937 --> 01:25.504
and that's the best you've got?

01:25.538 --> 01:27.073
Maybe I'm just getting started.

01:27.107 --> 01:28.507
[Cellphone ringing] Or not.

01:28.541 --> 01:29.942
Beckett.

01:29.977 --> 01:31.977
Ryan: Victim is Shana Baker.

01:32.011 --> 01:33.678
According to her pay stubs,

01:33.713 --> 01:36.448
she worked at eastbourne preschool.

01:36.483 --> 01:38.484
Point of entry is the
window in her bedroom.

01:38.518 --> 01:39.851
Somebody broke the glass.

01:39.885 --> 01:41.320
She would have heard that.

01:41.354 --> 01:43.088
And based on her body position,

01:43.123 --> 01:44.956
it doesn't look like she
was trying to run away.

01:44.991 --> 01:45.890
No, she wasn't.

01:45.925 --> 01:48.126
No signs of defensive wounds or a struggle.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.629
Just a single gunshot to the chest.

01:50.663 --> 01:53.999
Which means our killer was
in here when she came home.

01:54.033 --> 01:58.503
How a woman so astute could
choose to marry Castle.

01:58.537 --> 01:59.537
Ah, come on, Perlmutter, admit it.

01:59.571 --> 02:00.672
- You miss him, too.
- Please.

02:00.706 --> 02:02.440
Just knowing he's not gonna be here

02:02.474 --> 02:03.974
makes coming to work sheer bliss...

02:04.009 --> 02:04.975
[Laughs]

02:05.010 --> 02:06.477
All things considered.

02:06.512 --> 02:07.811
Time of death?

02:07.846 --> 02:09.514
Well, lividity and liver temp suggest

02:09.548 --> 02:11.315
between 9:00 and 10:30 last night.

02:11.350 --> 02:12.983
The neighbors were out,
which is probably why

02:13.018 --> 02:17.021
no one heard the shot,
but CSU did find this.

02:17.055 --> 02:19.157
- A cigarette butt.
- Yeah.

02:19.191 --> 02:21.625
It was in the fire escape
outside the bedroom window.

02:21.660 --> 02:23.727
The neighbors above and
below are not smokers.

02:23.762 --> 02:25.195
Neither was the victim,

02:25.229 --> 02:26.897
not with pearly whites like these.

02:26.931 --> 02:29.299
So if our killer had time to grab a smoke,

02:29.333 --> 02:31.301
then this wasn't a Bb&E.

02:31.335 --> 02:33.871
Our killer was lying in wait,
which means...

02:33.905 --> 02:36.210
this was premeditated.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.912
Where's the dog?

02:42.946 --> 02:43.846
Esposito: Dog's gone.

02:43.881 --> 02:45.715
Might have been scared off by the gunshot.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.751
Or, like Lassie, Sparkles is out there,

02:48.786 --> 02:51.020
trying to track down our killer.

02:51.055 --> 02:52.556
Really? Lassie?

02:52.590 --> 02:54.557
Someone has to provide us
with out-of-the-box thinking

02:54.591 --> 02:56.192
now that Castle's not around.

02:56.226 --> 02:58.661
Thank you. But I'll take it from here.

03:00.030 --> 03:01.597
Castle? What are you doing?

03:01.631 --> 03:03.599
You know that you're
not allowed to be here.

03:03.633 --> 03:05.768
Actually, I am,

03:05.803 --> 03:07.603
because I'm no longer Richard Castle,

03:07.637 --> 03:08.838
ordinary citizen.

03:08.872 --> 03:11.940
I am now Richard Castle...

03:11.974 --> 03:13.041
Private Investigator.

03:13.076 --> 03:17.279
You got your P.I.'s license...
without telling me?

03:17.314 --> 03:19.715
I took an online course.
Finished last night.

03:19.749 --> 03:20.716
Are you surprised?

03:20.750 --> 03:22.017
Can we talk for a second?

03:22.051 --> 03:24.820
Excuse me.

03:26.823 --> 03:27.823
[Chuckles]

03:27.857 --> 03:30.058
Castle,
the P.I.'s license doesn't change anything.

03:30.093 --> 03:32.794
The D.A.'s still not gonna
let you investigate with us.

03:32.829 --> 03:34.930
Oh, you see, that's the brilliant part.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.298
I'm not going to be investigating with you.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.901
No. Instead, I'm gonna conduct

03:39.936 --> 03:43.605
my own parallel investigation
alongside yours.

03:43.639 --> 03:45.707
Nice try,
but you know that's not gonna fly.

03:45.741 --> 03:46.986
Actually, it will fly.

03:47.006 --> 03:48.491
You see, as a...

03:48.511 --> 03:51.713
licensed P.I., I'm legally entitled

03:51.747 --> 03:54.482
to investigate this case
on behalf of my client.

03:54.516 --> 03:56.751
Ah. So who is your client?

03:56.785 --> 03:58.253
I'm sorry. That's confidential.

03:58.287 --> 03:59.920
I'm sorry. So is this investigation.

03:59.955 --> 04:01.555
Beckett: I'm afraid he's right.

04:01.589 --> 04:04.424
P.I.'s license or not,
this crime scene is closed,

04:04.459 --> 04:07.394
so you're gonna have to go.

04:12.996 --> 04:14.434
That's fine.

04:14.469 --> 04:17.337
I've already seen everything
I need to here anyway.

04:17.372 --> 04:19.773
I'll conduct my investigation elsewhere.

04:19.807 --> 04:21.745
Elsewhere where?

04:22.307 --> 04:25.612
I'm sorry, that's confidential, too.

04:26.381 --> 04:28.649
Huh.

04:29.784 --> 04:31.652
Esposito: Is he serious?

04:31.686 --> 04:33.920
I think he is,
and I think I'm getting a headache.

04:33.954 --> 04:35.822
Um, Ryan, see if you can get ahold

04:35.856 --> 04:37.590
of this building's superintendent.

04:37.624 --> 04:40.326
Look for any security cams
and try to reach out to her next of kin.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.461
Espo, you and I should go to
the school that she worked for,

04:42.496 --> 04:45.799
see if they can tell us anything else
about Shana's life.

04:45.833 --> 04:48.134
You really didn't know
about this P.I. thing?

04:48.169 --> 04:50.869
No. I mean,
I saw him spending hours on the computer,

04:50.904 --> 04:53.005
but I just figured he was playing
"Terra Quest."

04:53.039 --> 04:55.808
Mm-hmm.
[Sighs]

04:56.524 --> 04:59.044
So, what are you gonna do?

04:59.078 --> 05:01.079
Well, there's not much that I can do.

05:01.114 --> 05:03.683
Look, I know that he's doing
this to spend time with me,

05:03.717 --> 05:05.350
and I don't want to hurt his feelings.

05:05.384 --> 05:07.585
I don't know, maybe it'll be... harmless.

05:07.620 --> 05:08.720
Harmless?

05:08.754 --> 05:10.222
This is Castle we're talking about.

05:10.256 --> 05:12.324
Okay, but he knows nothing
about the case or the victim,

05:12.358 --> 05:14.059
so how much trouble can he be?

05:14.093 --> 05:15.560
We're about to find out.

05:15.594 --> 05:17.162
Castle, how did you get here?

05:17.197 --> 05:19.264
Well, it turns out the subway really
is faster in morning traffic.

05:19.299 --> 05:21.866
No, I mean how did you get here,

05:21.900 --> 05:23.668
to the school where Shana worked?

05:23.703 --> 05:25.236
Oh, well,
the neighbors didn't know very much.

05:25.270 --> 05:27.939
I figured her work would be your next stop.

05:27.973 --> 05:30.074
So, I've heard about this place.

05:30.108 --> 05:32.344
It's the feeder school in the city,

05:32.378 --> 05:34.746
the only place to be if you're
3 years old and connected.

05:34.766 --> 05:36.914
Isn't that Spalding Elliot over there?

05:36.949 --> 05:39.783
The state's top prosecutor.

05:39.818 --> 05:41.853
He's on the short list
for Attorney General.

05:41.887 --> 05:44.856
And behind him, James Kallman,
Internet billionaire.

05:44.890 --> 05:46.924
Even spotted diddy in the carpool lane.

05:46.959 --> 05:50.895
Ah, this place is a bastion
of the city's elite.

05:50.929 --> 05:52.730
I wonder what our victim did here,

05:52.764 --> 05:55.932
what foul scheme she was tangled in.

05:55.967 --> 05:59.269
Uh, Castle, you can't just follow me
inside and sit in on my interview.

05:59.303 --> 06:01.638
Well, actually, um...

06:01.673 --> 06:03.440
I was here first,

06:03.475 --> 06:05.809
so, really, you're following me.

06:05.844 --> 06:07.711
[Sighs]

06:07.746 --> 06:09.946
Shana was our admissions director.

06:09.981 --> 06:12.315
Parents, kids, everybody loved her.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.084
How did she seem to you recently?

06:14.118 --> 06:15.785
Any changes in her behavior?

06:15.819 --> 06:16.987
Actually, I don't know.

06:17.021 --> 06:19.222
She hadn't been around the past few days.

06:19.257 --> 06:20.891
- Why not?
- She had been working long hours

06:20.925 --> 06:23.260
to finalize admissions
for our new students.

06:23.294 --> 06:25.828
She just sent the acceptance
letters out last week,

06:25.863 --> 06:27.867
so she took the past couple
of days off to recover.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.599
If acceptance letters went out,

06:29.633 --> 06:32.302
does that mean rejection letters went out,
as well?

06:32.336 --> 06:33.736
Look, I know what you're thinking,

06:33.770 --> 06:36.272
and, yes, parents can get a bit emotional,

06:36.307 --> 06:39.442
especially when it comes to
their kids being turned down.

06:39.476 --> 06:41.311
Nothing has ever risen to the level

06:41.345 --> 06:43.238
of something like this.

06:43.258 --> 06:45.265
Esposito: Well, maybe this year did.

06:45.285 --> 06:47.649
There's something you guys got to hear.

06:47.684 --> 06:48.951
Man: You think you can ruin my kids' life?

06:48.985 --> 06:51.653
Bitch, I know where you live,
and you'll never see me coming.

06:51.688 --> 06:54.156
This was left on Shana's
voice-mail a few days ago

06:54.191 --> 06:56.792
and pretty much describes
what happened to her.

06:56.827 --> 06:58.961
Dr. Matthews, do you recognize this voice?

06:58.995 --> 07:00.295
I'm afraid I don't.

07:00.330 --> 07:02.531
Okay, check with the rest of the staff,
see if anyone else does.

07:02.565 --> 07:04.966
We'll also need copies of
the school's phone records,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.669
as well as a list of parents
that received rejection letters.

07:07.704 --> 07:10.805
- Of course.
- Can I get a copy of that list, too?

07:10.840 --> 07:12.774
I'm gonna take that as a no.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.676
Can't say that I'm shocked.

07:14.711 --> 07:18.579
A group of powerful people not
used to hearing the word no.

07:18.614 --> 07:20.749
Beckett: Come on, Castle, you really think

07:20.783 --> 07:23.651
that rejection from preschool
qualifies as motive for murder?

07:23.685 --> 07:25.453
With a feeder school like this one?

07:25.487 --> 07:26.821
A rejection from here could mean

07:26.856 --> 07:28.656
not getting into the
"right" elementary school,

07:28.690 --> 07:29.958
which affects high school,

07:29.992 --> 07:31.826
which affects college, and, oh, my God.

07:31.861 --> 07:35.663
Ah, people do insane things for their kids.

07:35.697 --> 07:37.831
You'll see.

07:39.635 --> 07:40.601
Where are you off to?

07:40.636 --> 07:41.669
Back to the precinct.

07:41.703 --> 07:43.103
Oh.

07:43.138 --> 07:44.872
Look, Castle, if it was my choice...

07:44.906 --> 07:46.707
Oh, please.
Why would I want to go to the precinct?

07:46.742 --> 07:49.143
No, a P.I.'s work is done in the field,

07:49.177 --> 07:51.311
and I've got lots of leads to follow up on.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.847
Okay. I'll see you tonight.

07:53.882 --> 07:55.951
See you tonight.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.618
So unfair.

08:15.002 --> 08:16.764
[Laughs]

08:16.784 --> 08:18.738
A private investigator?

08:18.773 --> 08:21.741
I swear, sir,
I had nothing to do with this.

08:21.776 --> 08:23.742
Yet he showed up at your crime scene!

08:23.777 --> 08:27.713
Let me remind you...
the D.A. was very explicit.

08:27.747 --> 08:30.216
Ever since he worked that case for the mob,

08:30.250 --> 08:34.020
Mr. Castle can no longer take
part in our investigations.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.154
He's not.

08:35.188 --> 08:36.755
I mean, technically, he's conducting

08:36.789 --> 08:38.657
his own investigation,
and since he's licensed,

08:38.692 --> 08:41.058
legally,
there's not much that I can do to stop him.

08:41.092 --> 08:44.196
Okay, Detective,
but let me be perfectly clear,

08:44.230 --> 08:46.732
you cannot help him either.

08:46.766 --> 08:48.266
And that goes for you, too.

08:48.301 --> 08:50.256
- I'm sorry?
- No sharing of information,

08:50.276 --> 08:51.837
no granting access, nothing,

08:51.871 --> 08:54.573
or there will be hell to pay.
Understood?

08:54.607 --> 08:55.708
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

08:55.742 --> 08:57.008
Gates: Good.

08:58.711 --> 09:00.511
"How much trouble can he be?"

09:00.546 --> 09:02.513
Trust me, once he finds out
that he has to work this case without me,

09:02.548 --> 09:04.349
he's gonna get bored,
and he's gonna move on.

09:04.383 --> 09:05.884
He found our victim's school without you.

09:05.918 --> 09:07.118
Yeah, but that was easy.

09:07.153 --> 09:09.054
He doesn't have access to financials,

09:09.088 --> 09:11.122
to phone records, to street-cam footage.

09:11.157 --> 09:12.757
I mean, how far is he gonna get?

09:12.791 --> 09:14.091
You know what would really suck?

09:14.125 --> 09:15.960
If Castle solved this case before we did.

09:15.994 --> 09:18.062
And th is not possible.

09:18.096 --> 09:20.698
Yeah, but what if he did?

09:20.733 --> 09:23.067
Well, then we'd never hear the end of it.

09:23.101 --> 09:26.237
Uh, no, you would never hear the end of it.

09:26.271 --> 09:27.739
You're the one who has
to go home to that guy.

09:27.773 --> 09:29.473
Listen, there is no way

09:29.507 --> 09:31.981
that he can solve this case before us.

09:43.288 --> 09:44.755
All right, who are you,

09:44.789 --> 09:47.478
and what are you doing
with a dead woman's dog?

10:17.788 --> 10:18.554
Whoa!

10:18.588 --> 10:19.422
Think you can get the drop on me!

10:19.456 --> 10:21.356
You don't know who you're messing with.

[Coughs]

10:36.663 --> 10:40.307
Okay, my name is Richard Castle, and I'm...

10:40.327 --> 10:42.294
- Oh, I can show you.
- No, no!

10:42.329 --> 10:43.396
[Hissing] [Screams]

10:43.430 --> 10:45.398
Pepper spray?!

10:45.432 --> 10:47.333
[Voice breaking] Why did you do that?!

10:47.367 --> 10:48.601
I thought you were reaching for a gun!

10:48.636 --> 10:50.717
No, I was reaching for my P.I. license.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.505
[Coughing]

10:52.540 --> 10:54.615
You're a P.I.?

10:55.220 --> 10:57.309
Aw, man, I'm sorry. Come here.

10:57.344 --> 10:58.844
I was mugged last week, all right?

10:58.878 --> 11:00.312
You can't trail people like that.

11:00.347 --> 11:01.247
Sorry. [Coughs]

11:01.281 --> 11:04.116
I'm looking into the murder of Shana Baker.

11:04.151 --> 11:05.751
[Wheezes] Oh, wait.

11:05.785 --> 11:07.353
- Shana's dead?
- Yes.

11:07.387 --> 11:08.820
She was my friend.

11:08.855 --> 11:10.489
Hey, who killed her?

11:10.524 --> 11:13.491
Brian Whitman,
senior partner at Tenzer Capitol.

11:13.526 --> 11:16.094
We traced the threatening
call to his office.

11:16.128 --> 11:18.530
The guy's a big shot
with even bigger anger-management problems,

11:18.565 --> 11:21.366
including slamming his
Tesla into this driver

11:21.400 --> 11:22.167
who cut him off.

11:22.201 --> 11:23.969
Anyone at the school recognize him?

11:24.003 --> 11:26.605
No, but I had unis show his
picture around Shana's building.

11:26.639 --> 11:28.273
The same day he left that voice-mail,

11:28.307 --> 11:31.176
neighbors saw him banging on her door,
yelling obscenities.

11:31.210 --> 11:32.643
He promised he'd be back.

11:32.678 --> 11:34.179
So I was a little... aggressive

11:34.213 --> 11:36.814
when Ms. Baker didn't let
my son into that school,

11:36.848 --> 11:38.649
but that doesn't mean I killed her.

11:38.684 --> 11:40.185
"Bitch, I know where you live,

11:40.219 --> 11:42.220
and you will never see me coming."

11:42.254 --> 11:44.188
That sounds like a death threat to me.

11:44.222 --> 11:45.522
I was being dramatic.

11:45.557 --> 11:47.224
How were you being when you shot her?

11:47.258 --> 11:49.226
[Sighs] Look, you don't understand.

11:49.260 --> 11:50.527
And neither will a jury.

11:50.562 --> 11:52.362
I had no reason to kill her.

11:52.397 --> 11:55.532
She changed her mind about my son.

11:55.567 --> 11:57.534
She decided to let him in.

11:57.569 --> 11:59.536
Mr. Whitman, we have the school records.

11:59.571 --> 12:01.205
This just happened two days ago.

12:01.239 --> 12:04.708
Call down there. You can check.

12:04.742 --> 12:07.321
I even have the letter she wrote me.

12:09.780 --> 12:12.149
Your son had already been rejected,

12:12.183 --> 12:13.850
so why would Shana change her mind?

12:13.884 --> 12:15.685
I don't know.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.320
She just did.

12:17.354 --> 12:18.755
Whitman's alibi checks out.

12:18.789 --> 12:20.590
He was on an investment call to Hong Kong

12:20.625 --> 12:21.992
at the time of the murder.

12:22.026 --> 12:23.860
And the school verifies his claim.

12:23.894 --> 12:26.663
Shana did reverse the decision on his son.

12:26.697 --> 12:29.065
Do you think she gave
into Whitman's threats?

12:29.100 --> 12:32.268
Nah. The headmistress said that
Shana would never cut a deal.

12:32.302 --> 12:33.336
If she felt threatened,

12:33.370 --> 12:36.272
she would have notified
the school or the police...

12:36.306 --> 12:38.174
Unless there's more to this story.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.308
Let's dig into Whitman,

12:39.343 --> 12:41.910
see if there's anything else
that connects him to Shana.

12:41.945 --> 12:42.945
He's hiding something.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.380
Well, it looks like our victim

12:44.414 --> 12:45.748
might have been hiding something herself.

12:45.782 --> 12:47.517
According to this bank statement,

12:47.551 --> 12:50.285
she withdrew $3,000 in
cash out of her account

12:50.319 --> 12:51.553
the day before she died.

12:51.587 --> 12:53.722
And I take it that's not
her normal pattern of withdrawal.

12:53.757 --> 12:56.003
No, in fact,
it nearly cleaned out her savings account.

12:56.023 --> 12:59.900
So what would Shana Baker be doing
that she needed that much cash?

13:00.630 --> 13:01.530
Shana was going out of town.

13:01.564 --> 13:03.365
That's why she wanted me to keep Sparkles.

13:03.399 --> 13:06.401
I'm assuming you're better with dogs
than you are with people.

13:06.435 --> 13:08.403
- Where did she go?
- No idea.

13:08.437 --> 13:10.038
In fact, the whole thing was sort of weird.

13:10.072 --> 13:12.767
- How so?
- Well, usually when I take Sparkles,

13:12.787 --> 13:15.810
she tells me weeks in advance,
but this was really sudden.

13:15.844 --> 13:17.445
I had to take him right away.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.545
And she always tells me where she's going,
but she didn't tell me this time.

13:20.943 --> 13:23.685
Do you think the trip had something to do
with why she was killed?

13:23.719 --> 13:26.420
Well, seeing as how she
dropped her dog off with you

13:26.454 --> 13:28.556
and the very next day she was murdered,

13:28.590 --> 13:30.958
my guess would be, yeah,
the two are related.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.231
Where do you think she went?

13:36.498 --> 13:38.432
[Humming "Flight of the Valkyries"]

[Screams]

13:39.467 --> 13:40.601
- Castle!
- Perlmutter.

13:40.635 --> 13:42.002
What are you...

13:42.036 --> 13:43.571
you're looking at my victim's chart!

13:43.605 --> 13:46.006
I'm just making sure you
filled it out properly.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.609
And may I say, for a man,
you have exquisite handwriting.

13:48.643 --> 13:49.943
Oh, give it back!

13:49.977 --> 13:51.011
Hey, hey, hey, look, look, look.

13:51.045 --> 13:52.813
You could make this a lot easier on me,
Perlmutter.

13:52.847 --> 13:54.848
Oh, because that's what I live for.

13:54.882 --> 13:58.284
I-I just believe that your
victim traveled somewhere

13:58.319 --> 13:59.385
before she died.

13:59.420 --> 14:02.155
Is there anything in the
autopsy that indicates where?

14:02.190 --> 14:04.624
I-I would rather switch
places with her than tell you!

14:04.658 --> 14:06.459
- Now... now, give me that!
- Hey.

14:06.493 --> 14:08.028
- I am warning you, Castle!
- Here it is.

14:08.062 --> 14:09.529
Stomach contents...

14:09.563 --> 14:11.531
two ounces of peanuts,
partially digested pretzels.

14:11.565 --> 14:15.000
Blood contains trace amounts
of over-the-counter sedative.

14:15.035 --> 14:17.337
She was on a plane. She flew somewhere.

14:18.004 --> 14:20.139
Thanks for your help.

14:20.173 --> 14:22.375
This isn't over! [Sighs]

14:22.409 --> 14:25.811
["Flight of the Valkyries" ringtone plays]

14:25.846 --> 14:27.780
- What?!
- Beckett: It's Beckett.

14:27.814 --> 14:29.514
We're trying to explain some anomalies

14:29.549 --> 14:30.850
in our victim's financial records.

14:30.884 --> 14:32.718
Are there any signs that
she traveled recently?

14:32.753 --> 14:34.353
Well, as a matter of fact,

14:34.387 --> 14:37.957
I was just discussing that
with the writer you married.

14:37.991 --> 14:39.091
Castle was at the morgue?

14:39.126 --> 14:41.360
How the hell did he find out
our victim had left town?

14:41.394 --> 14:44.063
I don't know, but Perlmutter
was right about the air travel.

14:44.097 --> 14:45.564
According to T.S.A. records,

14:45.598 --> 14:48.533
Shana took a 4:30 flight
to Boston two days ago.

14:48.568 --> 14:49.534
What was she doing in Boston?

14:49.569 --> 14:51.403
She doesn't have any
family or friends there,

14:51.437 --> 14:52.504
and I spoke to the school.

14:52.538 --> 14:53.572
She wasn't there for work,

14:53.606 --> 14:55.140
but she paid for the trip in cash

14:55.174 --> 14:56.642
like she was trying to keep it secret.

14:56.676 --> 14:58.410
It says here that her
return flight from Boston

14:58.444 --> 15:01.079
landed yesterday at 6:00 p.m.

15:01.113 --> 15:03.581
Just hours before her murder that night,

15:03.615 --> 15:04.515
meaning this mystery trip

15:04.549 --> 15:06.350
might have something to do with her death.

15:06.385 --> 15:07.518
Yeah. And look at this.

15:07.552 --> 15:10.521
According to her cell records,
right after she landed,

15:10.555 --> 15:13.057
she made a call to the
New York Ledger news desk.

15:13.092 --> 15:14.692
What's a preschool admissions officer doing

15:14.726 --> 15:15.960
calling the Ledger news desk?

15:15.995 --> 15:18.062
Maybe she uncovered something
that she thought was a story.

15:18.097 --> 15:19.196
But I checked with them over there,

15:19.230 --> 15:20.331
and nobody remembers talking to her.

15:20.365 --> 15:22.166
We got to find out what she
was doing during that trip.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.267
Yeah, we do,

15:23.302 --> 15:25.569
before your husband does
and makes us all look bad.

15:25.604 --> 15:27.273
I can help with that.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.606
The last charge that Shana
made on her credit card

15:29.626 --> 15:32.162
was for a lunch at a
restaurant two days ago.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.441
That's right before she left town.

15:33.461 --> 15:36.546
She split the bill with this woman,
Nicole Morris.

15:36.580 --> 15:38.448
She's an attorney at Harrison and Reid.

15:38.482 --> 15:40.245
That's one of the top
law firms in the country.

15:40.265 --> 15:41.796
Why would Shana be
meeting with an attorney?

15:41.816 --> 15:43.587
I don't know.

15:43.622 --> 15:44.989
But a high-powered attorney,

15:45.023 --> 15:47.558
a secret trip paid for in cash,

15:47.592 --> 15:50.957
and a phone call to a news desk.

15:52.163 --> 15:54.231
This is starting to smell like conspiracy.

15:54.265 --> 15:55.965
Well, I hate to admit it,

15:56.000 --> 15:57.634
but baby Castle over here might be right.

15:57.668 --> 16:00.170
Conspiracy or not,
if this lawyer met with Shana

16:00.204 --> 16:02.739
just before her trip,
she may know something about it.

16:02.773 --> 16:03.640
So where can I find her?

16:03.674 --> 16:05.275
Her assistant says that she's out all day

16:05.309 --> 16:06.276
with some clients,

16:06.310 --> 16:07.810
but you might be able to
catch her at her 3:00.

16:07.845 --> 16:09.847
- Here's the address.
- Okay, thanks.

16:42.722 --> 16:44.179
Nicole Morris?

16:44.213 --> 16:46.181
Uh, Detective Beckett, NYPD.

16:46.215 --> 16:49.350
I... Castle?

16:49.385 --> 16:51.687
What are you... doing here?

16:51.721 --> 16:53.021
I work here.

16:53.056 --> 16:55.490
Welcome to Richard Castle Investigations.

17:02.623 --> 17:04.925
When were you gonna tell
me that you had an office?

17:04.959 --> 17:06.760
Uh... Eventually.

17:06.794 --> 17:08.348
No. We're married.

17:08.367 --> 17:09.930
Married people tell each other things.

17:09.964 --> 17:11.731
Yeah, but you weren't exactly thrilled

17:11.766 --> 17:14.233
- when I got my P.I. license.
- 'Cause you didn't tell me.

17:14.268 --> 17:15.601
Now, what is she doing here?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.502
Oh. She had lunch with the victim

17:17.538 --> 17:19.172
right before the victim left town.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.174
No, no, no. I mean how did you find her?

17:21.208 --> 17:23.209
Ah, I was checking the victim's credit card

17:23.242 --> 17:25.444
for plane-ticket charges
to see where she flew,

17:25.479 --> 17:27.046
and instead I found a lunch charge...

17:27.080 --> 17:27.980
Wait a minute.

17:28.013 --> 17:29.715
You checked her credit-card records? How?

17:29.749 --> 17:32.517
Okay, we're getting into
kind of a gray area here,

17:32.552 --> 17:35.788
so let's just say it involved
her mother's maiden name

17:35.822 --> 17:37.690
and a serviceable falsetto.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.058
[Door opens]

17:39.092 --> 17:41.359
Uh, I'm sorry.
I-I have another appointment.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.962
Is this gonna take much longer?

17:42.996 --> 17:45.047
Be right there, Ms. Morris.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.800
So, Detective, so long as you're here,

17:47.834 --> 17:50.582
would you care to sit in on my interview?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.373
I-I had no idea she had been
killed until you called.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.742
It was... quite a shock.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.212
Ms. Morris, how well did you know Shana?

18:00.246 --> 18:02.747
Not very.
I-I met her a few months back

18:02.781 --> 18:04.649
when I toured Eastbourne's
school for my daughter.

18:04.683 --> 18:08.653
We hit it off,
but I decided not to apply this year,

18:08.687 --> 18:10.788
so I was surprised when
she called the other day.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.757
She said it was urgent
that she needed to meet

18:12.791 --> 18:13.958
before she left town.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.793
- Did she say where she was going?
- Boston, I-I think.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.490
Something about Radnor University.

18:18.510 --> 18:20.732
Did she mention why she was going there?

18:20.766 --> 18:23.634
No, and frankly,
after the questions she was asking,

18:23.668 --> 18:25.569
I didn't really want to know.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.670
Why? What did she ask about?

18:26.704 --> 18:28.805
Murder...

18:28.840 --> 18:30.807
specifically,
felony statutes covering murder

18:30.842 --> 18:32.843
in the commonwealth of Massachusetts,

18:32.877 --> 18:34.845
what qualifies as accessory to murder,

18:34.879 --> 18:36.013
conspiracy to commit murder,

18:36.047 --> 18:37.615
what's the difference between
murder and manslaughter,

18:37.649 --> 18:38.548
that sort of thing.

18:38.582 --> 18:41.018
I was hoping her interest was theoretical,

18:41.052 --> 18:45.789
but now that she's dead, maybe it wasn't.

18:45.823 --> 18:48.025
Again, thank you,
Ms. Morris, for your time.

18:48.059 --> 18:48.892
Of course.

18:48.926 --> 18:50.961
Please call me if I can help in any way.

18:50.995 --> 18:51.895
I will.

18:54.231 --> 18:56.132
Did you hear that...
felony law about murder?

18:56.167 --> 18:57.534
Do you know what this means?

18:57.568 --> 18:59.702
Yes, that there's a hell of a lot more
to Shana's trip than we know.

18:59.736 --> 19:01.971
And whatever trouble she
got involved in up there,

19:02.005 --> 19:03.540
I'm betting it followed her home.

19:03.574 --> 19:05.782
Okay, if that's the case, then...

19:06.343 --> 19:07.310
[Sighs] I'm...

19:07.344 --> 19:08.545
uh, I'm sorry, Castle.

19:08.579 --> 19:10.280
Uh, we shouldn't be doing this.

19:10.314 --> 19:11.180
Doing what?

19:11.214 --> 19:13.315
Uh, this... you, me theorizing together.

19:13.349 --> 19:15.685
It's just...
it's not right, especially here,

19:15.719 --> 19:17.887
after this whole P.I. thing. I...

19:17.921 --> 19:19.155
No. Shh! don't...

19:19.189 --> 19:20.790
don't think about it.

19:20.824 --> 19:23.959
Just think about how it
feels when we work together.

19:23.994 --> 19:25.327
Besides, we have the place to ourselves.

19:25.361 --> 19:26.328
Who's gonna know?

19:26.362 --> 19:28.463
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:28.498 --> 19:29.964
[Cellphone ringing]

19:29.999 --> 19:31.300
It's work.

19:31.334 --> 19:32.734
- Don't answer it.
- No, but I have to.

19:32.768 --> 19:33.968
Y...
[Cellphone beeps]

19:34.003 --> 19:36.505
Hi, Espo. What's up?

19:36.539 --> 19:38.407
So, you asked me to dig
deeper on Brian Whitman,

19:38.441 --> 19:40.409
see if there were any
other connections to Shana.

19:40.443 --> 19:42.662
Well, you'll never guess what I found.

19:43.779 --> 19:45.313
No.

19:45.347 --> 19:47.682
No, you're right,
that can't be a coincidence.

19:47.717 --> 19:48.750
What's not a coincidence?

19:48.784 --> 19:49.751
Okay, bring him in.

19:49.785 --> 19:51.352
Bring who in?

19:51.386 --> 19:53.755
I'm sorry, baby, I got to go.

19:53.789 --> 19:54.555
Mwah.

19:54.590 --> 19:56.439
You're not gonna tell me anything?!

19:56.724 --> 19:59.894
You said married people
tell each other things!

20:02.412 --> 20:04.098
Who the hell do you think you are,
Detective?!

20:04.132 --> 20:05.600
Why am I back here?!

20:05.634 --> 20:08.021
Uh, Mr. Whitman, please.

20:12.073 --> 20:13.541
You know, you're a generous man.

20:13.575 --> 20:15.776
You support charitable causes.

20:15.810 --> 20:18.678
You sit on the board of
numerous esteemed organizations,

20:18.713 --> 20:20.247
including Radnor University.

20:20.281 --> 20:21.254
So?

20:21.274 --> 20:24.251
So just before Shana Baker died,
she took a trip to radnor.

20:24.285 --> 20:25.719
You know anything about that?

20:25.754 --> 20:26.920
Sorry. Can't help you.

20:26.955 --> 20:28.455
Beckett: I think you can.

20:28.489 --> 20:30.224
Her trip,
your position on the school's board,

20:30.258 --> 20:32.459
and her help in getting your
son into that preschool...

20:32.493 --> 20:33.960
I think those three are related.

20:33.994 --> 20:35.762
Esposito: And you're gonna tell us how,

20:35.796 --> 20:37.731
or we're just gonna find out anyway.

20:37.765 --> 20:39.132
Then we're gonna take your
ass down for obstruction

20:39.166 --> 20:41.200
and maybe accessory to murder.

20:41.235 --> 20:43.536
Not to mention what's gonna happen
at that preschool when they find out

20:43.571 --> 20:46.239
you refused to cooperate
on an investigation

20:46.274 --> 20:47.574
of one of their employees' deaths.

20:47.608 --> 20:48.608
I don't think your kid

20:48.643 --> 20:50.777
is going to be enrolled
there for much longer.

20:50.811 --> 20:52.979
Okay, okay, okay. Look, look, look.

20:53.013 --> 20:54.480
She came to me, okay?

20:54.514 --> 20:57.416
She wanted me to pull
some strings at Radnor,

20:57.450 --> 20:59.752
and in return, she got my kid in.

20:59.787 --> 21:01.487
What strings did she want you to pull?

21:01.521 --> 21:03.256
She wanted me to contact
the Dean of students

21:03.290 --> 21:04.924
to tell him Shana was coming to see him

21:04.958 --> 21:06.392
and that she needed help with something.

21:06.426 --> 21:07.959
And what exactly did she need help with?

21:07.994 --> 21:09.094
She wouldn't tell me.

21:09.128 --> 21:11.664
She just asked me to make
the phone call to the Dean.

21:11.698 --> 21:13.565
That's all I know, I swear.

21:15.235 --> 21:17.736
So we're good, right?

21:17.770 --> 21:19.871
My son's still in?

21:19.906 --> 21:22.441
The Dean confirmed that
Shana was there yesterday,

21:22.476 --> 21:24.910
requesting access to
radnor campus police files.

21:24.944 --> 21:26.578
Police files? Which ones?

21:26.613 --> 21:29.081
He didn't know,
but according to their records room,

21:29.115 --> 21:31.483
she looked through
incident reports from 1999.

21:31.517 --> 21:32.618
Huh.

21:32.652 --> 21:36.088
Why would she be looking at
15-year-old incident reports?

21:36.122 --> 21:37.388
I bet Castle knows.

21:37.423 --> 21:38.657
Are you kidding me?

21:38.691 --> 21:41.058
There is no way he's ahead of us on this.

21:41.093 --> 21:42.960
Hey, he got to the morgue
before us and that lawyer.

21:42.995 --> 21:45.997
Ryan, he is resourceful,
but he is not that resourceful.

21:46.031 --> 21:47.398
He got you to marry him, didn't he?

21:47.433 --> 21:48.733
Call him.

21:48.767 --> 21:49.767
We'll see where he's at.

21:49.801 --> 21:51.169
I just cut him out of the case.

21:51.203 --> 21:52.837
I can't call him and ask him what he knows.

21:52.871 --> 21:54.071
Then don't ask him.

21:54.106 --> 21:58.575
You're a detective. Detect.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.244
Thank you for picking up dinner.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.813
I didn't want you to
starve on that P.I. salary.

22:02.848 --> 22:03.580
[Chuckles]

22:03.615 --> 22:05.149
So, how is your first case going?

22:05.183 --> 22:07.118
Did I tell you I got peppersprayed today?

22:07.152 --> 22:08.252
You say that like it's a good thing.

22:08.286 --> 22:10.487
Yeah. I mean, now I'm kind of stuck.

22:10.522 --> 22:12.789
I know our victim took a
trip to Radnor University.

22:12.823 --> 22:14.525
I just have no idea why.

22:14.559 --> 22:16.425
I hacked into her social-media accounts.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.761
Wait. You know how to hack
into social-media accounts?

22:18.795 --> 22:20.363
"Hacking" might be overstating it.

22:20.397 --> 22:22.765
Her password for everything is "Sparkles,"
her dog's name.

22:22.799 --> 22:25.635
Point is, without police resources,

22:25.669 --> 22:27.170
the best I can do is

22:27.204 --> 22:28.971
go through her friends' online posts

22:29.005 --> 22:32.307
and look for some connections
to Radnor University.

22:32.341 --> 22:33.876
- Are there any?
- Just one thing.

22:33.910 --> 22:35.277
But it happened 15 years ago.

22:35.311 --> 22:36.779
I have no idea if it's even relevant.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.480
I just wish I knew what Beckett had.

22:38.514 --> 22:40.482
[Telephone ringing] Mm.

22:40.516 --> 22:42.517
Richard Castle Investigations.

22:42.552 --> 22:43.719
Beckett: Hey, babe.

22:43.753 --> 22:45.187
Just checking in. What you doing?

22:45.221 --> 22:46.789
Oh, just hanging out at the office.
How about you?

22:46.823 --> 22:48.402
He has an office?

22:48.891 --> 22:51.293
Uh, just wondering how your day's going.

22:51.327 --> 22:52.794
Good.

22:52.828 --> 22:54.563
Really good, actually.

22:54.597 --> 22:55.730
How about yours?

22:55.764 --> 22:57.165
Yeah, mine's... good, too.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.201
Uh, really, really good.

22:59.235 --> 23:02.070
That's good. Great.
I should have said great.

23:02.104 --> 23:03.205
Mine's great.

23:03.239 --> 23:05.206
Great. That's...

23:05.240 --> 23:07.408
Okay, so, I'll see you tonight.

23:07.442 --> 23:10.477
I'll see you tonight.

23:11.680 --> 23:12.847
He knows something.

23:12.881 --> 23:13.581
She has something.

23:13.615 --> 23:15.016
And you have to find out what.

23:15.050 --> 23:16.800
And I'm gonna find out what.

23:28.062 --> 23:29.763
Oh, hey, there. You're home early.

23:29.797 --> 23:31.498
Hey. I couldn't wait to see you.

23:31.533 --> 23:33.667
So, I picked up a bottle
of wine on the way home.

23:33.702 --> 23:34.668
It's your favorite.

23:34.703 --> 23:36.203
Oh, that is...

23:36.238 --> 23:37.771
such a big glass.

23:37.805 --> 23:39.639
- What's the occasion?
- No occasion.

23:39.673 --> 23:41.341
I just figured this would be a great way

23:41.375 --> 23:43.409
for you to unwind after a long day at work.

23:43.444 --> 23:45.445
Oh, that is so nice.
And where's your glass?

23:45.479 --> 23:47.278
Uh, it's over there.

23:48.816 --> 23:51.517
Well, why don't we top that off for you,
shall we?

23:52.987 --> 23:58.824
Once, uh,
we get all nice and relaxed and unwind...

23:58.859 --> 24:00.826
there we go...

24:00.861 --> 24:03.929
you can tell me all about your day.

24:03.964 --> 24:06.332
Yeah. [Laughs]

24:06.367 --> 24:07.233
Wait a minute.

24:07.268 --> 24:09.569
You're not trying to ply me with wine

24:09.603 --> 24:11.904
to find out what I know about this case,
are you?

24:11.938 --> 24:12.972
Of course not.

24:13.006 --> 24:15.007
That's not what you're trying to do, is it?

24:15.041 --> 24:16.608
- No.
- Okay.

24:16.628 --> 24:20.579
Because if you were trying
to find out what I know,

24:20.613 --> 24:22.982
that would mean you're stuck.

24:23.016 --> 24:26.532
I am not stuck.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.953
Good, because I'm not stuck either.

24:28.988 --> 24:30.855
So you do know something.
So you do know something.

24:30.890 --> 24:32.924
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

24:32.958 --> 24:33.958
All right, this is crazy.

24:33.993 --> 24:35.960
If we both have something,

24:35.995 --> 24:37.195
why don't we just trade?

24:37.229 --> 24:38.963
Castle, I can't. You know that.

24:38.998 --> 24:40.198
Oh, "can't."

24:40.232 --> 24:41.866
What happened to that rebellious girl

24:41.901 --> 24:43.302
with the leather jacket and the motorcycle?

24:43.336 --> 24:44.535
Would she say "can't"?

24:44.569 --> 24:45.569
[Scoffs]

24:45.604 --> 24:48.531
She enforces the law now
and drinks expensive wine.

24:49.041 --> 24:50.608
Then think about our victim.

24:50.642 --> 24:53.511
Are you really gonna let
a couple of silly rules

24:53.545 --> 24:56.756
stand in the way of bringing Shana justice?

24:58.257 --> 24:59.717
Okay, fine.

24:59.751 --> 25:01.985
We'll do it just this once... for her.

25:02.020 --> 25:05.055
- You first.
- You first.

25:05.089 --> 25:06.723
We'll go at the same time.

25:06.743 --> 25:08.270
- Ready?
- Yeah.

25:08.290 --> 25:09.883
- She was looking into old police records
- Shana had an old boyfriend

25:09.903 --> 25:11.645
- who died at Radnor University.
- at Radnor University. Wait.

25:11.665 --> 25:14.349
She had an old boyfriend who
died at Radnor University?

25:14.369 --> 25:16.036
How long ago?
- 15 years.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.302
His name was Jeff Whalen.

25:18.336 --> 25:20.304
He drank too much at a
party and fell out a window.

25:20.338 --> 25:22.005
If she was looking into
old police records...

25:22.040 --> 25:23.506
And interested in homicide law...

25:23.541 --> 25:24.875
She must have thought that his death

25:24.909 --> 25:26.310
was more than just an accident.

25:26.344 --> 25:27.644
She was investigating a murder.

25:27.678 --> 25:29.146
And somehow that got her killed.

25:29.180 --> 25:31.460
Oh, my God. I missed this.

25:35.374 --> 25:37.142
Castle: Last night was amazing.

25:37.926 --> 25:41.518
Wait, are you talking about
the put-together we did on the case, or...?

25:41.538 --> 25:42.379
That.

25:42.414 --> 25:44.415
But the put-together,
that was pretty amazing, too.

25:44.449 --> 25:45.616
[Sighs]

25:46.075 --> 25:48.886
It's been forever since we tried that.

25:50.021 --> 25:52.203
I forgot how creative you can get.

25:52.223 --> 25:54.157
Oh, we're not talking about
the case anymore, are we?

25:54.191 --> 25:54.958
Mnh-mnh.

25:54.992 --> 25:57.594
[Giggles] [Cellphone rings]

26:01.832 --> 26:03.300
Hey, Ryan.

26:03.334 --> 26:04.301
Great. Okay.

26:04.335 --> 26:05.302
How long before the fil...

26:05.336 --> 26:07.971
before it gets there?

26:08.955 --> 26:10.419
Before what gets there?

26:11.675 --> 26:13.832
You were about to say "files," weren't you?
No.

26:13.852 --> 26:17.046
Oh, you texted Ryan last night
about Shana's old boyfriend

26:17.080 --> 26:18.481
and told him to get those
old police files for you...

26:18.515 --> 26:20.616
- Wha...?
- While you were in bed with me.

26:20.651 --> 26:22.485
I... Ryan, I'll be right over.

26:22.519 --> 26:25.621
Well, you're gonna let me take
a look at those files, right?

26:25.656 --> 26:27.156
I mean, that's only fair.

26:27.190 --> 26:29.358
Castle. [Scoffs] I can't.

26:29.392 --> 26:31.860
That would be crossing the line.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.895
You didn't seem to care
about lines last night.

26:33.930 --> 26:35.497
No, last night, it was anything goes.

26:35.531 --> 26:39.168
Yes, Castle. And it was great.

26:39.202 --> 26:40.635
[Smooches]

26:40.670 --> 26:41.570
Come on.

26:41.604 --> 26:44.206
We both know it was just a one-time thing.

26:46.909 --> 26:49.177
You know,
I thought we had something special!

26:49.211 --> 26:50.178
[Elevator bell dings]

26:50.212 --> 26:51.847
Is that the file?

26:51.881 --> 26:54.583
Yeah, and it looks like your
2:00 a.m. hunch paid off.

26:54.617 --> 26:56.084
What were you doing up so late, anyway?

26:56.118 --> 26:58.186
I was working on the case.

26:58.220 --> 26:59.220
Huh.

26:59.254 --> 27:01.155
Well,
I don't know what Shana was looking to find

27:01.190 --> 27:02.223
in that report,

27:02.257 --> 27:04.325
but it refers to witness statements

27:04.360 --> 27:06.027
taken at the party

27:06.061 --> 27:07.863
where Shana's boyfriend, Jeff Whalen, died.

27:07.883 --> 27:09.030
But the witness statements,

27:09.065 --> 27:10.932
as well as the list of
people who gave them,

27:10.966 --> 27:12.067
they're all missing.

27:12.101 --> 27:14.435
- The file's been tampered with?
- It looks that way.

27:14.469 --> 27:16.537
When I called over to radnor,
they said that those pages

27:16.572 --> 27:18.139
must have been "lost"

27:18.174 --> 27:20.575
when their records were
digitized 10 years ago.

27:20.609 --> 27:22.243
What about the officer that
wrote the original report?

27:22.277 --> 27:23.744
Passed away a few years back.

27:23.778 --> 27:24.978
Okay, if the information is missing,

27:25.013 --> 27:27.281
then what did Shana learn from
this report that got her killed?

27:27.316 --> 27:29.116
According to the guy in
the records department,

27:29.150 --> 27:30.117
when Shana finished with the archive,

27:30.151 --> 27:32.253
she asked for directions
to the alumni office.

27:32.287 --> 27:33.387
I-I placed a call over there,

27:33.422 --> 27:36.757
but they don't open for
another half an hour or so.

27:36.791 --> 27:39.159
Oh. How'd it go with Castle last night?

27:39.194 --> 27:40.393
Is he ahead of us or behind us?

27:40.428 --> 27:43.063
Uh, we're definitely on top of him.

27:43.098 --> 27:45.733
Castle:
Without access to those police files,

27:45.767 --> 27:47.400
they are gonna leave me in the dust.

27:47.435 --> 27:50.137
I thought you became a
P.I. to work with Beckett.

27:50.171 --> 27:51.972
When did it become a competition?

27:52.006 --> 27:53.901
When she took something beautiful

27:53.921 --> 27:56.409
that we'd built together and
shared it with another man.

27:56.444 --> 27:57.867
What?

27:58.326 --> 28:00.510
Investigatively speaking.

28:02.424 --> 28:04.751
But... I may have found a way to catch up.

28:04.785 --> 28:07.153
I have been looking for any mention

28:07.187 --> 28:08.855
of Shana's boyfriend's death...

28:08.889 --> 28:11.157
wading through newspapers,
public records, and the like.

28:11.191 --> 28:12.886
And check this out.

28:12.906 --> 28:14.861
It's from the Radnor University da.

28:14.895 --> 28:18.316
Do you notice anything
unusual about this ad?

28:20.700 --> 28:23.803
That people were ever
actually afraid of y2k?

28:23.837 --> 28:24.737
[Chuckles]

28:24.772 --> 28:27.506
Yes, that, and the ad is above the fold.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.441
I worked on my school paper.

28:29.476 --> 28:30.643
That's layout 101...

28:30.677 --> 28:33.144
you never place an ad above
the fold on the front page...

28:33.178 --> 28:36.180
unless something changed, last-minute,

28:36.214 --> 28:37.448
creating a space to fill.

28:37.483 --> 28:38.683
Like the lead story was shortened.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.850
Something was pulled from it

28:39.885 --> 28:40.985
just before they published,

28:41.019 --> 28:42.520
and I bet it relates to this case.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.155
You could track down the reporter,

28:44.189 --> 28:45.022
see if he could tell you.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.057
Except the story is credited to "staff."

28:47.092 --> 28:48.726
But there is someone else who knows.

28:48.761 --> 28:49.760
Who?

28:49.795 --> 28:52.897
The person who ordered
the article shortened in the first place...

28:52.931 --> 28:53.931
the editor.

28:53.965 --> 28:54.799
Esposito: Frank Jackson?

28:54.833 --> 28:56.600
Ryan: Yeah, the guy at the alumni office

28:56.634 --> 28:57.534
said that Shana came in

28:57.568 --> 28:59.837
requesting all of his contact information.

28:59.871 --> 29:00.637
Frank Jackson?

29:00.672 --> 29:03.174
Why does that sound so familiar?

29:03.208 --> 29:06.576
Because he is now a reporter
at the New York ledger.

29:06.611 --> 29:08.612
That's who Shana was
calling the day she died.

29:08.646 --> 29:10.246
And I can tell you why... 15 years ago,

29:10.281 --> 29:11.881
Frank Jackson was the president

29:11.916 --> 29:13.950
of the exclusive Tiger Claw social club,

29:13.984 --> 29:15.919
the organization that hosted the party

29:15.953 --> 29:17.421
where Shana's boyfriend died.

29:17.455 --> 29:19.556
So, Shana called Frank as
part of her investigation.

29:19.590 --> 29:21.425
She knew that if he was
president of that club,

29:21.459 --> 29:23.126
he must have been at the party that night.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.295
And if there was a cover-up,
he would've been in on it.

29:25.329 --> 29:26.996
Then he could be our killer.

29:34.338 --> 29:36.906
Excuse me! Mr. Jackson!

29:36.941 --> 29:39.274
I-I wanted to talk to you
about an article you edited

29:39.309 --> 29:41.143
about 15 years ago about a student who died

29:41.177 --> 29:43.279
at the Tiger Claw social club.

29:45.114 --> 29:47.149
Sorry. I'm late. Another time.

29:47.183 --> 29:50.085
You left something out of that article,
didn't you?

29:51.640 --> 29:54.457
Something about how
Jeff Whalen really died.

29:55.176 --> 29:56.458
Who'd you say you were again?

29:56.492 --> 29:57.625
I'm Richard Castle.

29:57.660 --> 29:59.895
I'm a private investigator
working the Shana Baker murder.

30:01.530 --> 30:04.399
Okay. Not here. I know somewhere nearby.

30:04.433 --> 30:06.343
It's more private.

30:12.397 --> 30:13.764
We still can't find Jackson.

30:13.798 --> 30:16.267
He's not at his apartment,
and he's not answering his phone.

30:16.301 --> 30:17.268
Okay. Put out an A.P.B.

30:17.302 --> 30:19.369
If he's Shana's killer,
then he may try to run.

30:19.403 --> 30:20.804
Yo. That was the Ledger.

30:20.839 --> 30:23.003
One of Jackson's coworkers
said that he saw him

30:23.023 --> 30:25.696
leave the building about an hour ago
with some guy who looked like Castle.

30:25.716 --> 30:29.183
- Castle found Jackson?
- And he has no idea how dangerous he is.

30:29.203 --> 30:31.047
[Dialing]

30:31.882 --> 30:33.683
Damn it, Castle, answer.

30:33.717 --> 30:36.085
[Sighs] Why can't he just stay out of this?

30:36.119 --> 30:38.120
When have I ever stayed out of anything?

30:38.155 --> 30:39.088
Oh, thank God.

30:39.122 --> 30:41.456
Now, what are you doing here?

30:41.491 --> 30:43.425
I know the rules, but,
uh, given who I'm with,

30:43.459 --> 30:45.772
I thought we might make an exception.

30:48.204 --> 30:49.686
I knew this day would come.

30:49.706 --> 30:51.400
When Shana called the other night,

30:51.434 --> 30:52.734
I was almost relieved.

30:52.769 --> 30:54.202
Just tell Detective Beckett

30:54.236 --> 30:55.604
what you told me about why she called.

30:55.638 --> 30:56.605
It was about her boyfriend.

30:56.639 --> 30:59.240
She wanted to know how
Jeff Whalen really died

30:59.275 --> 31:00.909
that night at Radnor University.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.210
Jeff was pretty wasted.

31:02.244 --> 31:03.978
Uh, he went upstairs to get some air.

31:04.013 --> 31:06.214
And the next thing I
remember was the scream.

31:06.248 --> 31:07.148
Now, I didn't see what happened,

31:07.183 --> 31:09.150
but I know Jeff wasn't alone in that room

31:09.185 --> 31:10.584
when he fell out the window.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.220
You think that he was murdered?

31:12.254 --> 31:13.087
All I know is the next day,

31:13.122 --> 31:14.889
I was pressured to change the story.

31:14.924 --> 31:16.257
I was told to take out any mention

31:16.292 --> 31:17.758
of who was in the room with him.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.160
Wait. Who pressured you?

31:19.195 --> 31:20.361
Someone big.

31:20.395 --> 31:24.214
He said he was just trying to
protect his son's reputation.

31:24.599 --> 31:28.272
He told me he could ruin my life...

31:29.588 --> 31:32.005
Or he could do great things for me.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.475
I was a kid, and I was scared.

31:34.509 --> 31:37.077
And since the cops already
said that it was an accident,

31:37.111 --> 31:40.092
I figured why ruin two lives?

31:40.389 --> 31:42.349
Only it wasn't an accident.

31:42.383 --> 31:46.186
By the time I had realized
the investigation had been...

31:46.221 --> 31:49.256
rigged,
I had already helped to cover up a murder.

31:49.290 --> 31:51.024
And if you had come forward,

31:51.059 --> 31:53.327
your career as a journalist would be over.

31:53.361 --> 31:54.962
Exactly.

31:54.996 --> 31:58.297
I can't hide from it anymore, you know.

31:58.332 --> 31:59.932
Who were they protecting, Frank?

31:59.967 --> 32:02.545
Who pushed Shana's
boyfriend out the window?

32:03.836 --> 32:06.951
Last person I told that, um, wound up dead.

32:07.559 --> 32:10.103
I mean, you sure you really want to know?

32:11.912 --> 32:13.428
Let me get this straight.

32:13.448 --> 32:16.382
You think federal
prosecutor Spalding Elliot

32:16.416 --> 32:17.616
killed Shana Baker?

32:17.650 --> 32:19.285
The events support it, sir.

32:19.319 --> 32:22.488
According to Mr. Jackson,
right after Shana spoke to him,

32:22.522 --> 32:24.323
she went to confront Elliot about his role

32:24.358 --> 32:25.992
in her former boyfriend's death.

32:26.026 --> 32:28.527
And he's a parent at her school,
so she knew where to find him.

32:28.561 --> 32:30.296
Look, it... it's no secret

32:30.330 --> 32:32.731
that Elliot is being
groomed for bigger things,

32:32.766 --> 32:34.867
so maybe he needed to silence Shana

32:34.901 --> 32:36.802
to keep her from destroying him.

32:36.836 --> 32:39.237
Detective, if you're gonna go after

32:39.272 --> 32:41.540
the top federal prosecutor in New York,

32:41.574 --> 32:43.341
you're gonna need more than just the word

32:43.376 --> 32:45.143
of a compromised journalist.

32:45.177 --> 32:47.078
You're gonna need bullet-proof evidence,

32:47.113 --> 32:48.746
and you don't have it.

32:48.781 --> 32:51.555
What if we can place
Elliot at the crime scene?

32:52.126 --> 32:54.552
We found a cigarette butt
with DNA evidence on it.

32:54.586 --> 32:56.975
Which you're gonna match to his how?

32:56.995 --> 33:00.758
I doubt if he's gonna volunteer
his DNA if he's guilty.

33:00.793 --> 33:03.061
- We'll find a way.
- Tread lightly, detective.

33:03.095 --> 33:05.162
You're hunting big game here.

33:05.196 --> 33:07.331
And until we have a stronger case,

33:07.365 --> 33:09.450
we cannot afford to attract any attention,

33:09.470 --> 33:11.736
which means, Mr. Castle,

33:11.770 --> 33:13.992
you cannot be involved in this at all,

33:14.012 --> 33:16.946
even in your privateinvestigator capacity.

33:16.966 --> 33:19.376
Sir, we never would have
gotten this far without...

33:19.411 --> 33:21.278
Oh, no. Actually, uh, she's right.

33:21.313 --> 33:22.346
Rules are rules.

33:22.380 --> 33:23.613
As a matter of fact,

33:23.648 --> 33:25.882
I shouldn't even be here right now.

33:25.917 --> 33:26.750
[Door opens]

33:26.784 --> 33:28.785
Well, that was easier than I expected.

33:28.820 --> 33:30.054
Yeah.

33:30.088 --> 33:31.188
Huh.

33:39.296 --> 33:40.597
Come on.

33:42.299 --> 33:43.600
Come on.

33:45.102 --> 33:46.803
There.

33:46.838 --> 33:51.374
One sample of damning DNA
evidence coming right up.

33:54.478 --> 33:55.878
Sorry, Sherlock. Not this time.

33:57.448 --> 33:59.482
Pros will take it from here.

33:59.516 --> 34:01.417
Uh...

34:14.498 --> 34:15.697
[sighs] A cigarette butt.

34:15.732 --> 34:17.331
Is that supposed to mean something?

34:17.367 --> 34:20.202
It was recovered at the scene
of Shana Baker's murder.

34:20.235 --> 34:22.471
Preliminary DNA tests indicate it's yours.

34:22.505 --> 34:24.473
That's not possible.

34:24.507 --> 34:25.808
Beckett: It is, because you were there.

34:25.842 --> 34:27.141
You killed her, Mr. Elliot.

34:27.176 --> 34:29.478
That's ridiculous. I didn't even know her.

34:29.512 --> 34:31.080
- Why would I kill her?
- Because she knew the truth

34:31.100 --> 34:33.139
about what happened
that night at the party,

34:33.159 --> 34:34.741
about Jeff Whalen's murder.

34:34.761 --> 34:36.351
We know that she tracked you down,

34:36.386 --> 34:38.520
and when she confronted you,
you had her silenced.

34:38.554 --> 34:39.554
Okay, listen.

34:39.588 --> 34:40.911
Okay. She did track me down.

34:40.931 --> 34:42.757
And she practically accosted me

34:42.791 --> 34:44.250
in front of my office the other night.

34:44.270 --> 34:46.828
And I told her the truth, all right?

34:46.862 --> 34:48.597
That... that I... yes, I was in the room

34:48.630 --> 34:50.665
the night that Jeff fell,
but I did not push him.

34:50.699 --> 34:52.534
It was an accident. It's in the report.

34:52.568 --> 34:54.268
Then why did your father cover it up?

34:54.303 --> 34:56.204
Because he knew that the
truth wouldn't matter,

34:56.239 --> 34:58.206
that I would be convicted in
the court of public opinion

34:58.241 --> 34:59.173
just for being there,

34:59.208 --> 35:01.209
and that my political career would be over

35:01.243 --> 35:01.943
before it ever started.

35:01.977 --> 35:03.444
So you swept it under the rug,

35:03.478 --> 35:04.911
and then when Shana came along...

35:04.946 --> 35:06.747
she... do you...
do you think she was the first?

35:06.781 --> 35:08.615
Listen, my enemies have been circling

35:08.649 --> 35:09.783
around this story for years.

35:09.817 --> 35:12.619
And you want to know why the
media's never run with it?

35:12.653 --> 35:14.221
Because there's nothing there.

35:17.625 --> 35:19.259
Until now.

35:19.293 --> 35:21.461
[Scoffs]

35:21.495 --> 35:23.229
I'm being set up. Mr. Elliot...

35:23.264 --> 35:24.864
Shana said somebody contacted her

35:24.898 --> 35:26.866
and told her that I pushed Jeff.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.302
They urged her to "look into the truth."

35:29.336 --> 35:31.638
And then... then she ends up dead?

35:31.672 --> 35:33.239
And you find this at the scene?

35:33.274 --> 35:34.874
You're claiming someone is framing you?

35:34.908 --> 35:36.008
I am a criminal prosecutor.

35:36.042 --> 35:38.644
Do you honestly think that
I would be stupid enough

35:38.678 --> 35:40.980
to leave a piece of
evidence like this behind?

35:41.014 --> 35:45.284
Look,
I make my name fighting corporate greed.

35:45.318 --> 35:47.787
And my political ambitions are...
are no secret to anyone.

35:47.821 --> 35:49.088
This... don't you see?

35:49.122 --> 35:52.291
This... this is the perfect way
for my enemies to destroy me.

35:52.325 --> 35:55.594
Okay, there's only one problem
with that theory, Mr. Elliot.

35:55.628 --> 35:56.662
In order to frame you,

35:56.696 --> 35:59.331
a person would need to
know that you were there

35:59.365 --> 36:00.499
at that party 15 years ago

36:00.533 --> 36:02.967
and know that Shana Baker
had just come from seeing you

36:03.002 --> 36:04.269
an hour earlier.

36:04.304 --> 36:06.338
Maybe there is a simpler explanation.

36:06.372 --> 36:09.574
There is no conspiracy against you.

36:09.609 --> 36:10.809
You killed her.

36:10.843 --> 36:12.610
You know, I-I couldn't have killed her

36:12.644 --> 36:14.578
because I was at a fundraiser that night.

36:14.613 --> 36:17.148
Yeah, we checked into that.
You got there at 11:00.

36:17.183 --> 36:18.149
Shana was dead by 10:30.

36:18.184 --> 36:19.350
I swear to you.

36:19.384 --> 36:21.319
- I am being set up.
- I'm sorry.

36:21.353 --> 36:23.321
I'm afraid I have no other
choice but to arrest you for...

36:23.355 --> 36:25.423
Wait! [Panting]

36:25.457 --> 36:26.590
He's telling the truth.

36:26.625 --> 36:28.292
Spalding Elliot is not our killer.

36:29.961 --> 36:31.462
Hi.

36:35.268 --> 36:39.027
Was I not clear when I told you
to stay away from this case?!

36:39.047 --> 36:41.186
Okay, I can see you're upset,

36:41.206 --> 36:43.006
but I promise...
in a moment, you'll understand.

36:43.041 --> 36:44.141
Jeremy?

36:44.175 --> 36:45.306
This is Jeremy.

36:45.326 --> 36:47.310
He's the victim's friend and dog sitter.

36:47.345 --> 36:49.679
Oh, so, Jeremy is some sort of a witness?

36:49.714 --> 36:51.514
Uh, not quite.
Jeremy, if I may...

36:51.549 --> 36:54.584
Oh, the dog? The dog is the witness?

36:54.619 --> 36:55.819
Mr. Castle...

36:55.854 --> 36:58.055
Just watch.

37:00.358 --> 37:01.491
Castle, what are you doing?

37:01.525 --> 37:02.792
Oh, proving this man's innocence.

37:02.826 --> 37:03.793
Castle...

37:03.827 --> 37:04.861
Mr. Elliot, if I may...

37:04.895 --> 37:07.297
Please. No! [Sneezes]

37:07.331 --> 37:09.132
See, I remember reading
in a profile of Mr. Elliot

37:09.166 --> 37:10.933
that he has a severe
allergy to long-haired dogs.

37:10.968 --> 37:12.469
[Sneezing]

37:12.503 --> 37:14.837
And the victim's apartment
was covered in dog hair.

37:14.872 --> 37:15.772
Exactly.

37:15.806 --> 37:17.539
Now, does this seem like the kind of man

37:17.574 --> 37:19.208
who could wait in Shana's apartment,

37:19.243 --> 37:20.943
let alone smoke a
cigarette while he did so?

37:20.978 --> 37:22.544
[Sneezing] Please!

37:22.579 --> 37:24.947
No, but, I mean,
he could be faking the whole thing.

37:24.982 --> 37:27.683
Please! Please!
Get him out of here before the hives start!

37:27.717 --> 37:29.318
[Sneezing continues]

37:29.352 --> 37:31.020
Ooh. I think that ship has sailed.

37:31.054 --> 37:34.189
[Sneezing continues]

37:34.223 --> 37:36.858
Okay. Yeah. Definitely not faking that.

37:36.893 --> 37:39.495
Here is Spalding Elliot
arriving at the fundraiser

37:39.529 --> 37:41.062
the night of Shana's death.

37:41.097 --> 37:43.965
Note the lack of red splotches on his face.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.801
There's no way that he came

37:45.835 --> 37:47.235
straight from her apartment
looking like that.

37:47.270 --> 37:49.204
Which means Ryan nailed it before.

37:49.238 --> 37:51.406
This is a conspiracy.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.508
Ryan, you played the "C" card?

37:53.542 --> 37:55.677
Well, I mean, um, you weren't around.

37:55.711 --> 37:57.501
Somebody had to step up.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.480
Okay, for this setup to work,

37:59.515 --> 38:02.317
someone had to activate Shana
and tell her about the cover up.

38:02.351 --> 38:04.686
Right. That way, her death would
create an investigative path

38:04.720 --> 38:05.986
that led straight to Elliot.

38:06.021 --> 38:07.021
Setting him up for her murder.

38:07.055 --> 38:10.224
My guess is we're dealing with
some kind of big-money fixer,

38:10.258 --> 38:13.361
a shadow-y gun-for-hire,
Michael Clayton type.

38:13.395 --> 38:16.364
Well, whoever planted Elliot's
DNA at the crime scene

38:16.398 --> 38:19.334
had to have gotten the
cigarette butt from somewhere.

38:19.368 --> 38:22.002
Which means they had to intersect
with Elliot at some point.

38:22.037 --> 38:24.338
If we can figure out where and when...

38:24.372 --> 38:26.240
Gates: "We," Mr. Castle?

38:27.742 --> 38:29.276
Really?

38:29.311 --> 38:30.544
But I...

38:30.578 --> 38:32.959
I brought him... on a silver pla...

38:33.815 --> 38:35.850
Fine.

38:35.884 --> 38:38.079
I'll show myself out.

38:42.223 --> 38:45.271
Castle: We were all after the same thing...
justice.

38:45.291 --> 38:49.076
Trouble is, when it came to me,
lady justice had different plans.

38:49.096 --> 38:50.962
While Beckett and the boys
closed in on the killer,

38:50.982 --> 38:53.584
I had been to the gutter
like yesterday's trash.

38:53.604 --> 38:54.738
[Chuckles]

38:54.758 --> 38:57.108
It just didn't seem fair.

38:57.128 --> 38:58.969
You're right.

38:59.639 --> 39:00.773
It's not fair.

39:00.807 --> 39:01.774
Hey! Beckett.

39:01.808 --> 39:03.877
I was just, uh,
listening to some notes I made

39:03.911 --> 39:05.778
for the ca... I just...
what are you doing here?

39:05.812 --> 39:07.973
You know, we took another
look at the cigarette butt...

39:07.993 --> 39:09.541
the one with Elliot's DNA.

39:09.561 --> 39:13.453
It turns out it had traces
of barbecue sauce on it.

39:13.487 --> 39:15.854
I thought you said you couldn't share.

39:15.889 --> 39:17.090
I can't.

39:17.124 --> 39:18.191
But if you hadn't shared,

39:18.225 --> 39:21.434
then we'd still be looking
at Elliot as our killer.

39:21.596 --> 39:23.262
And besides, we got the place to ourselves,

39:23.297 --> 39:25.157
so who's gonna know?

39:25.629 --> 39:29.309
So,
I assume Elliot has had barbecue recently.

39:29.329 --> 39:32.846
Just last week at a rib joint uptown.

39:32.866 --> 39:34.570
We scrubbed the security video,

39:34.590 --> 39:36.208
and you'll never guess who we found

39:36.242 --> 39:38.053
digging through the ash can

39:38.073 --> 39:40.659
for one of Elliot's cigarette butts.

39:40.679 --> 39:42.280
No way. That's our Michael Clayton?

39:42.315 --> 39:44.316
Likely hired by whoever
is behind all of this

39:44.350 --> 39:46.050
to befriend Shana, whisper in her ear,

39:46.085 --> 39:47.552
and urge her to investigate.

39:47.587 --> 39:50.188
And who ensured we followed
the trail to Radnor.

39:50.223 --> 39:52.624
Oh,
I wish I could see the look on their face

39:52.658 --> 39:54.392
when you slap the cuffs on them.

39:54.427 --> 39:57.229
Yeah, well, maybe you can.

39:57.263 --> 39:58.430
[Knock on door]

39:58.464 --> 39:59.697
Mr. Castle.

39:59.732 --> 40:02.823
I got an urgent call to meet
you here regarding Shana Baker?

40:05.270 --> 40:06.521
Yes.

40:06.541 --> 40:09.073
Yes. Just one final question, Ms. Morris.

40:09.862 --> 40:13.295
Who hired you to kill Shana Baker
and frame Spalding Elliot?

40:15.281 --> 40:17.181
[Chuckles] Wh-what are you talking about?

40:17.215 --> 40:19.150
I think you know.

40:20.985 --> 40:22.910
That's you retrieving
Elliot's cigarette butt

40:22.930 --> 40:26.367
so you could plant it at the crime scene
after you killed Shana.

40:29.763 --> 40:34.064
Nicole Morris, you're under arrest for
the murder of Shana Baker.

40:34.098 --> 40:37.300
You know, I always heard Harrison and Reid
were a killer law firm.

40:37.334 --> 40:39.541
Now I know why.

40:43.307 --> 40:45.108
Case closed.

40:48.764 --> 40:51.414
You think we'll ever know
who Nicole Morris works for?

40:51.448 --> 40:53.216
Ah, she's not gonna tell us.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.285
But we did find several large payments

40:55.319 --> 40:56.319
wired to her account,

40:56.353 --> 40:58.721
and Elliot is determined
to find their source.

40:58.755 --> 41:00.256
Well, I would be determined, too.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.425
That guy would be spending time in jail

41:02.459 --> 41:04.460
if it wasn't for a dog named Sparkles.

41:04.495 --> 41:06.628
And a P.I. named Castle.

41:06.648 --> 41:07.881
I'm proud of you.

41:07.901 --> 41:11.233
I just... I thought this was
another one of your larks,

41:11.267 --> 41:14.003
a way to kill time, but...
you impressed me.

41:14.037 --> 41:16.138
You know, I kind of impressed myself.

41:16.173 --> 41:18.808
I got all sorts of ideas for my new book.

41:18.842 --> 41:21.510
Just one thing didn't work out as planned.

41:21.544 --> 41:23.412
[Sighs] You know that if this was up to me

41:23.446 --> 41:25.997
that we would be working together, right?

41:26.017 --> 41:29.049
Yes, but since it's not and we can't,

41:29.069 --> 41:31.687
I was wondering how you'd feel if I...

41:31.721 --> 41:34.099
Kept with this for a while.

41:35.692 --> 41:37.275
Don't move.

41:42.888 --> 41:45.668
Hmm. What's this?

41:45.688 --> 41:47.666
It's my answer.

41:53.039 --> 41:54.175
[Gasps]

41:55.288 --> 41:58.379
I'm so gonna wear this to work tomorrow!

41:58.413 --> 42:00.822
Keep going. There's something else.

42:01.356 --> 42:03.851
[Chuckles]

42:04.171 --> 42:07.831
So, maybe you can use that
to locate an actual client.

42:07.955 --> 42:09.890
I think I see something
I like better already.

42:09.924 --> 42:11.740
[Chuckles]

42:12.088 --> 42:14.728
You care to go into the other room and...
share?

42:14.763 --> 42:15.863
On one condition.

42:15.897 --> 42:18.030
- What?
- The hat stays on.
