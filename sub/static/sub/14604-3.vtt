00:01.245 --> 00:02.774
Before there was sex...

00:02.776 --> 00:05.224
before there was the city,
there was just me,

00:05.344 --> 00:08.327
Carrie... Carrie Bradshaw
from Castlebury, Connecticut.

00:08.447 --> 00:11.000
Walt was never gonna love you
in any real way.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.866
- I don't understand.
- I don't think Walt likes girls.

00:12.986 --> 00:15.318
I wanna be with you.
I wanna see what this is.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.587
I can't believe I ever
loved you. You make me sick.

00:17.589 --> 00:20.757
I'm Sam Jones.
And P.S.... I prefer "Samantha."

00:20.759 --> 00:22.626
My friend's out of town.
I'm just crashing here.

00:22.628 --> 00:24.828
Well, your friend sure has
a lot of crap. So pretentious.

00:24.830 --> 00:26.230
It's from Larissa.

00:26.232 --> 00:28.666
"Konnichiwa. Returning early.
See you in a week."

00:28.668 --> 00:30.101
She's coming home early.

00:30.103 --> 00:31.970
- What came between you and that boy?
- Maggie.

00:31.972 --> 00:34.239
- Bet you regret kissing me.
- Yes, I do.

00:34.241 --> 00:36.474
Whatever you have to say,
I deserve it.

00:36.476 --> 00:37.542
Fine. You broke my heart,

00:37.544 --> 00:40.111
and I hate you because
I still love you.

out there.

01:25.256 --> 01:27.991
What happened to your bike?
It looks so... sad.

01:27.993 --> 01:30.927
Someone stole the wheel,
the chain,

01:30.929 --> 01:32.962
and my favorite horn.

01:32.964 --> 01:34.564
I think I've spent more money
on bike parts this summer

01:34.566 --> 01:36.700
than I actually made
as a bike messenger.

01:36.702 --> 01:37.734
I feel your pain.

01:37.736 --> 01:39.702
Every single necklace
I wore on the subway

01:39.704 --> 01:41.371
got ripped right off.

01:41.373 --> 01:43.640
Eventually, I just started
wearing candy necklaces instead.

01:43.642 --> 01:44.841
I gotta hand it to us.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.009
We made it an entire summer

01:46.011 --> 01:48.645
in one of the most dangerous
places there is.

01:48.647 --> 01:50.614
Well, that's all
coming to an end

01:50.616 --> 01:52.749
now that we're heading back
Castlebury.

01:52.751 --> 01:53.984
Where I will
walk down the halls,

01:53.986 --> 01:56.386
wondering if everyone can feel
that I'm gay.

01:56.388 --> 01:59.523
And I will walk down the halls
and get to see Sebastian,

01:59.525 --> 02:02.093
every single day,
in close proximity.

02:02.095 --> 02:03.294
I know what you mean.

02:03.296 --> 02:06.197
I'm more afraid of Maggie
than common criminals.

02:06.199 --> 02:08.598
I just have no idea how
she's gonna act around me

02:08.601 --> 02:10.668
or if she'll expose me.

02:10.669 --> 02:12.336
So it's decided.
We'll just stay here.

02:12.338 --> 02:14.705
It's safer in the crime capital
of the world.

02:14.707 --> 02:17.140
Yeah. I don't know Larissa
feels about roomies.

02:17.142 --> 02:19.242
Konnichiwa!

02:19.244 --> 02:21.645
And no,
I don't do roommates.

02:21.647 --> 02:23.747
Yes, I was listening
at the door.

02:23.749 --> 02:26.083
Or maybe I just fell asleep
out there for a minute.

02:26.085 --> 02:28.385
- Larissa, welcome home.
- Oh, mwah. Thank you, darling.

02:28.387 --> 02:32.022
I have horrible jet lag,
so forgive me if I black out.

02:32.024 --> 02:33.490
That flight was an eternity.

02:33.492 --> 02:35.159
What is it? Like, 17 hours?

02:35.161 --> 02:37.695
I have no idea.
I took two muscle relaxants.

02:37.697 --> 02:40.331
Now, boys and girls,
sit down so I can regale you

02:40.333 --> 02:43.167
with tales of the far east,
Japanese style.

02:43.169 --> 02:44.335
Mmm!

02:44.337 --> 02:46.003
With... sake!

02:46.005 --> 02:47.371
Ooh.

02:47.373 --> 02:49.073
Apparently, I drank most of
this one on the plane.

02:49.075 --> 02:51.442
But not worry. I have more.

02:52.579 --> 02:54.245
Looks like Larissa's back.

02:55.615 --> 02:57.582
You're gonna love me.

02:57.584 --> 02:59.417
Why? Did you land me a date
with Emilio Estevez?

02:59.419 --> 03:02.287
These are
your college applications.

03:02.289 --> 03:04.122
It's time to start planning
your future.

03:04.124 --> 03:05.523
Thanks. I think I'll just keep
the life I have now.

03:05.525 --> 03:06.858
It's... so awesome.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.026
Stop that.

03:08.028 --> 03:09.594
Now I've already done a lot
of the work.

03:09.596 --> 03:11.296
I researched all the colleges
in the area

03:11.298 --> 03:13.231
that would accept your G.P.A.
and test scores,

03:13.233 --> 03:16.134
plus all of these schools offer
financial aid.

03:16.136 --> 03:17.635
Could someone just give me
financial aid

03:17.637 --> 03:19.303
without me having to go
to college?

03:19.305 --> 03:23.775
Now the eight schools I picked
each have a $25 application fee.

03:23.777 --> 03:27.678
So altogether, you're looking at
$200 to apply.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.379
200 bucks?
Mouse, that's a lot.

03:29.381 --> 03:30.480
I know,

03:30.482 --> 03:31.982
but I also know you have
your babysitting job

03:31.984 --> 03:33.217
and you've been saving up.

03:33.219 --> 03:35.819
Yeah, so I can buy
lots of cute clothes.

03:35.821 --> 03:38.489
Stop shopping. Start saving.

03:38.491 --> 03:41.258
$200 is a small price to pay

03:41.260 --> 03:43.527
to start you on the road
to higher education.

03:43.529 --> 03:45.396
All you have to do is
fill out these forms

03:45.398 --> 03:47.665
and write a personal essay.

03:49.568 --> 03:50.935
You're welcome.

03:50.937 --> 03:53.905
Wait. For making me spend $500
of my own hard-earned money

03:53.907 --> 03:56.341
on some charity gala,
just to make you look good?

03:56.343 --> 03:59.277
There will be hot babes.

03:59.279 --> 04:01.146
I'm taking Deb.
Really?

04:01.148 --> 04:02.847
That ballroom is gonna be
crawling with hot blondes,

04:02.849 --> 04:05.717
all of them scrambling around
to find their sugar daddy.

04:05.719 --> 04:07.919
Yeah. Well, I'm not really
the, uh...

04:07.921 --> 04:09.688
sugar daddy type.

04:09.690 --> 04:11.089
And I doubt
most of those women

04:11.091 --> 04:12.457
would be knocking
each other over

04:12.459 --> 04:14.459
for a date with
a small-town lawyer.

04:14.461 --> 04:18.863
But they would be interested
in a powerhouse M & A lawyer

04:18.865 --> 04:20.098
at Long & Whitney.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.332
Which would be you.

04:21.334 --> 04:23.200
Or you,

04:23.202 --> 04:25.035
if you come back
to the firm.

04:25.037 --> 04:26.370
Ha ha.

04:26.372 --> 04:28.405
Come on, Harlan. You know
I'm happy with my practice.

04:28.407 --> 04:29.540
Listen to me, Tom.

04:29.542 --> 04:31.542
The M & A business...
it is booming.

04:31.544 --> 04:34.244
Investment banks are
taking over the world.

04:34.246 --> 04:36.447
I need good lawyers,
tough lawyers.

04:36.449 --> 04:38.115
I remember you
back in the day.

04:38.117 --> 04:40.384
You were
a relentless barracuda.

04:40.386 --> 04:42.687
You're really offering me
a job?

04:42.689 --> 04:43.921
Well, I figured your situation
might've changed

04:43.923 --> 04:45.489
since your girls are
growing up.

04:45.491 --> 04:47.625
I mean, I thought you might
be ready to re-up,

04:47.627 --> 04:49.593
get back in with the big boys.
You don't miss it?

04:53.219 --> 04:55.220
I don't know.
I mean...

04:55.222 --> 04:56.555
I'm not sure
I'm that guy anymore.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.490
You know, things at home are
very manageable.

04:58.492 --> 05:02.160
I-I keep my own hours.
I see my girls.

05:02.162 --> 05:04.062
I might lose those things
if I worked here.

05:04.064 --> 05:07.532
Just imagine what you'd gain...
bigger cases, big money,

05:07.534 --> 05:09.534
that incredible
adrenaline rush.

05:09.536 --> 05:12.437
Not to mention the abundance
of hot blondes.

05:12.439 --> 05:14.473
Duly noted.
You like hot blondes.

05:14.475 --> 05:15.974
- I do.
 - All right.

05:15.976 --> 05:18.109
Well, look,
I-I appreciate the offer,

05:18.111 --> 05:20.712
but I'm just not sure that this
world is a fit for me anymore.

05:20.714 --> 05:23.114
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

05:23.116 --> 05:25.016
You know where I am
if you change your mind.

05:27.486 --> 05:29.487
Think about my offer.

05:31.258 --> 05:33.792
So, yeah, the geisha thing
didn't work out.

05:33.794 --> 05:35.593
Those women are
<i>way</i> too subservient

05:35.595 --> 05:36.995
for my taste.

05:36.997 --> 05:40.432
I need to be the boss,
even when I'm doing the boss.

05:40.434 --> 05:41.599
I had a mad affair

05:41.601 --> 05:44.636
with the C.E.O. of
a major Japanese corporation.

05:44.638 --> 05:47.472
Here's a hint...
they make electronics.

05:47.474 --> 05:49.007
Oh!

05:49.009 --> 05:52.177
A tiny man
but... very powerful.

05:52.179 --> 05:54.112
He taught me so much.

05:54.114 --> 05:56.181
I don't really wanna hear about
your sexcapades.

05:56.183 --> 05:59.017
Don't be such a deviant.
He taught me to be Zen.

05:59.019 --> 06:00.985
Zen?

06:00.987 --> 06:04.088
I-is that an adjective
or a verb?

06:04.090 --> 06:05.256
It's a way of life.

06:05.258 --> 06:06.591
This is gonna be hard
to explain,

06:06.593 --> 06:08.926
especially after
three muscle relaxers.

06:08.928 --> 06:10.161
I thought you took two.

06:10.163 --> 06:12.330
I'm a nervous flier,

06:12.332 --> 06:14.699
but less so after being Zen.

06:14.701 --> 06:16.367
- And tranquilized.
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.369 --> 06:19.537
Zen is all about
being in the moment,

06:19.539 --> 06:23.941
remaining calm and detached
from expectations.

06:25.377 --> 06:28.379
Sake, waketake,
sock-it-to-me.

06:28.381 --> 06:31.516
Sake, waketake,
sock-it-to-me.

06:31.518 --> 06:33.851
- Sake...
- I'm sorry. Are you speaking in tongues?

06:33.853 --> 06:35.620
No. It's my mantra.

06:35.622 --> 06:37.955
It's a little combination
of words I came up with

06:37.957 --> 06:40.358
to help me feel calm
and centered.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.760
"We are but a steady rock
in a stream,

06:42.762 --> 06:45.262
all of life's rough waters
rushing around us."

06:45.264 --> 06:48.065
I wanna be Zen.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.767
That sounds so lovely.

06:49.769 --> 06:50.835
Mm.

06:50.837 --> 06:52.803
If I could detach myself
from Sebastian

06:52.805 --> 06:55.372
once I get back to school,
he won't be able to affect me.

06:55.374 --> 06:59.777
He'll be like the rough waters
rushing around my steady rock.

06:59.779 --> 07:01.212
Still pining after
the hair God?

07:01.214 --> 07:02.947
I feel like I've said that
before.

07:02.949 --> 07:04.215
That's because
I'm a broken record.

07:04.217 --> 07:06.450
But I don't want to do that
anymore.

07:06.452 --> 07:09.853
My pattern of falling into
Sebastian's charming aura

07:09.855 --> 07:11.255
is... is over.

07:11.257 --> 07:14.925
If he comes up to me with that
delicious smelling scent of his,

07:14.927 --> 07:16.160
I...

07:16.162 --> 07:17.594
He doesn't even wear cologne.

07:17.596 --> 07:19.330
It won't faze me

07:19.332 --> 07:21.265
because I'll be Zen.

07:21.267 --> 07:22.566
Wonderful.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.234
Plus, I'm sure all the beautiful
men you met in New York

07:24.236 --> 07:25.869
will make that all easier.

07:25.871 --> 07:27.271
I didn't really meet any guys,

07:27.273 --> 07:29.606
but I did make
a fun new girlfriend.

07:29.608 --> 07:31.875
Is it a lesbian lover?
Exciting.

07:31.877 --> 07:34.511
Uh, no. Sorry.

07:34.513 --> 07:36.013
But don't be disappointed.

07:36.015 --> 07:37.114
There is one gay relationship

07:37.116 --> 07:38.715
that seems to be going
pretty well.

07:38.717 --> 07:39.950
It's true.

07:39.952 --> 07:41.985
Bennet and I have been having
a lot of fun together.

07:41.987 --> 07:43.554
And is the sex spectacular?

07:43.556 --> 07:47.057
I always imagined Bennet to be
positively ravenous in bed.

07:47.059 --> 07:48.292
Actually, we...

07:48.294 --> 07:50.294
well, haven't done it yet.

07:50.296 --> 07:51.561
In fact,
I'm not completely sure

07:51.563 --> 07:53.764
I know what "doing it"
would even mean.

07:53.766 --> 07:55.599
I'm so new to this.

07:55.601 --> 07:58.802
Sweetie, it could mean
a number of things.

07:58.804 --> 08:00.670
Let me explain in detail.

08:00.672 --> 08:01.838
- No.
- No! It...

08:01.840 --> 08:03.173
Really, I'll find out
on my own.

08:03.175 --> 08:06.309
Bennet and I are just
hanging out. Nothing official.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.278
Just keeping it easy breezy.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.348
Well, I hope you have a little
bit more room for excitement

08:11.350 --> 08:14.117
before heading off to that
tiny little town of yours.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.853
Mm, I think we can make time
in our busy schedules.

08:16.855 --> 08:18.121
Terrific.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.590
Then next week, we'll have
one last blowout at Youshiki.

08:20.592 --> 08:21.858
Youshi-what?
Is that a new club?

08:21.860 --> 08:24.160
No. It's a fantastic
Japanese Festival

08:24.162 --> 08:26.296
here in the city.
East meets West.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.665
Everyone who is everyone
is gonna be there.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.567
Carrie, maybe you invite
your new friend?

08:30.569 --> 08:31.701
Oh, that would be great.

08:31.703 --> 08:33.370
I-I think you're really gonna
like Samantha.

08:33.371 --> 08:35.205
It's <i>the</i> end of summer event

08:35.207 --> 08:38.942
with sake tastings
and fabulous clothes on display

08:38.943 --> 08:41.711
from fabulous
Japanese designers.

08:41.712 --> 08:44.080
Alcohol and fashion.
My favorite combination.

08:44.082 --> 08:46.049
Well, it sounds divine.

08:46.051 --> 08:47.984
I feel centered
just thinking about it.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.620
To a new calm and detached
way of life.

08:52.424 --> 08:53.623
Yes.

08:53.625 --> 08:56.125
And anything that is
thrown at me in Castlebury

08:56.127 --> 08:57.827
will just wash past me.

09:02.132 --> 09:04.500
What are you doing here?
She's not home.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.135
I'm actually here
to see you.

09:06.137 --> 09:07.737
I need your help
with Carrie.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.074

09:24.837 --> 09:27.905
Welcome to Youshiki, everyone.

09:30.810 --> 09:35.310
Ohh. Have you ever seen anything
so beautiful in all your life?

09:35.849 --> 09:38.850
Who knew a simple gardenia
could teach us so much?

09:38.852 --> 09:41.219
Just makes you want to
detach from the clutter

09:41.221 --> 09:43.388
and embrace the calm.

09:43.390 --> 09:45.523
<i>I was transfixed.</i>

09:45.525 --> 09:47.325
<i>It was so simple,</i>

09:47.327 --> 09:50.028
<i>so effortlessly beautiful</i>
<i>and tranquil,</i>

09:50.030 --> 09:54.065
<i>just like I wanted my life</i>
<i>to be.</i>

09:54.067 --> 09:56.401
She's finding her Zen.

09:56.403 --> 09:57.902
I'm gonna find some sake.

10:03.609 --> 10:05.610
I can't believe
it's my last day here.

10:05.612 --> 10:07.245
I'm gonna miss you.

10:07.247 --> 10:08.980
I'm gonna mi you, too.

10:08.982 --> 10:10.415
And New York.

10:10.417 --> 10:11.849
But mostly me, right?

10:11.851 --> 10:13.151
Yes.

10:13.153 --> 10:16.821
It's been a really fun summer
hanging out.

10:16.823 --> 10:18.756
It's gonna be hard to go back
to Castlebury.

10:18.758 --> 10:22.226
You mean to being
back in the closet?

10:22.228 --> 10:24.028
How am I gonna do this?

10:24.030 --> 10:25.730
I mean,
I can't come out yet.

10:25.732 --> 10:27.265
I'm not ready
to tell my parents.

10:27.267 --> 10:28.533
I definitely hear ya.

10:28.535 --> 10:30.701
And in school
it's way too risky.

10:30.703 --> 10:31.969
Yeah. Tell me about it.

10:31.971 --> 10:34.505
There was this kid named
Jim Hansen... wasn't even gay.

10:34.507 --> 10:36.641
He just liked theater
and was always singing "Pippin"

10:36.643 --> 10:38.242
they beat the crap out
of him.

10:38.244 --> 10:39.777
Okay, I'm not so sure
that kid wasn't gay.

10:39.779 --> 10:42.947
But, yes,
you must be careful.

10:44.684 --> 10:47.585
Whoa. Is that a Ninja?

10:47.587 --> 10:49.987
It is.

10:49.989 --> 10:52.089
Yeah, I always wanted to be
a Ninja when I was a kid.

10:52.091 --> 10:53.424
Why? So you could
be really quiet

10:53.426 --> 10:55.493
and throw daggers at people
when they aren't looking?

10:55.495 --> 10:57.194
Mostly so I could
slip in and out of places

10:57.196 --> 10:59.597
without being seen.

10:59.599 --> 11:01.465
Amen.

11:01.467 --> 11:03.300
Maybe that's
every closeted kid's dream.

11:03.302 --> 11:04.668
It's certainly mine.

11:06.239 --> 11:07.471
Then do it.

11:07.473 --> 11:09.406
Get in and out of that school
without getting punched.

11:09.408 --> 11:11.609
Yeah.
I like that goal.

11:11.611 --> 11:14.879
And if you're ever feeling alone
or scared about any of it,

11:14.881 --> 11:17.248
I want you to call me.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.415
Anytime.

11:18.417 --> 11:20.584
Thanks.

11:20.586 --> 11:23.053
I'll be fine as long as I fly
under the radar,

11:23.055 --> 11:24.188
with no hoopla.

11:24.190 --> 11:26.390
What in the hell
is this place?!

11:27.693 --> 11:30.894
Ugh. The bridge and tunnel crowd
are infesting everywhere.

11:30.896 --> 11:33.163
What is that loud banshee
doing here?

11:33.165 --> 11:34.331
Carrie!

11:34.333 --> 11:35.966
Carrie!

11:39.939 --> 11:42.940
I invited her.
That's my friend Samantha.

11:42.942 --> 11:44.608
We'll come... we'll come
over there, okay?!

11:44.610 --> 11:46.343
Stay there!
We'll come over there!

11:46.345 --> 11:47.811
Okay?

11:59.925 --> 12:02.193
Oh, look who it is.

12:02.195 --> 12:03.761
It's been too long.

12:03.763 --> 12:05.229
Yeah, or not long enough.

12:05.231 --> 12:06.864
Just keep driving, Simon.

12:06.866 --> 12:07.998
This little move of yours

12:08.000 --> 12:09.266
doesn't usually
work out so good for me.

12:09.268 --> 12:10.768
What are you talking about?

12:10.770 --> 12:12.670
Why don't you just go home
to your fiancée?

12:14.039 --> 12:15.739
Don't be that way.

12:15.741 --> 12:18.242
I just miss us hanging out.
I wanna catch up.

12:18.244 --> 12:19.343
Sorry. I'm headed somewhere.

12:19.345 --> 12:22.513
Where's somewhere?
I'll give you a lift.

12:22.515 --> 12:23.881
The library's just around
the corner.

12:25.184 --> 12:26.483
The library?

12:26.485 --> 12:28.552
What do you need
with a library?

12:28.554 --> 12:30.287
I'm working on
my college applications.

12:30.289 --> 12:31.555
Ugh.

12:31.557 --> 12:33.590
That sounds like
a lot of work.

12:33.592 --> 12:35.059
Besides, what do you need
college for?

12:35.061 --> 12:37.294
So I can get out of
this sorry little town, Simon.

12:37.296 --> 12:39.563
Come on. Some things
in this town aren't so bad.

12:39.565 --> 12:41.899
We both know you don't want to
work on those applications.

12:48.740 --> 12:51.041
Fine, but it has nothing to do
with you.

12:52.377 --> 12:54.177
I'm just procrastinating.

13:05.489 --> 13:09.359
So what do I wear to one of
these charity balls thingies?

13:09.361 --> 13:10.727
Is it dressy?

13:10.729 --> 13:12.662
Um...

13:12.664 --> 13:14.898
Yes. Yeah, you should wear
a dress.

13:15.866 --> 13:18.268
Long one? Short one?

13:20.738 --> 13:22.038
I don't know.

13:23.275 --> 13:26.409
You gotta find out.
I-I can't wear the wrong thing.

13:26.411 --> 13:27.577
That I know.

13:27.579 --> 13:28.678
Okay, okay.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.947
I will call
Harlan's secretary Barbara

13:30.949 --> 13:32.549
and, uh, find out.

13:32.551 --> 13:33.883
I don't want to
talk to him directly.

13:33.885 --> 13:36.286
You afraid he's gonna ask
for more money?

13:36.288 --> 13:38.822
I'm afraid he's gonna hassle me
about the offer.

13:38.824 --> 13:40.323
What offer?

13:40.325 --> 13:41.591
Did he offer to take us
in his limo?

13:42.694 --> 13:45.295
He wants me to come back to work
at the firm.

13:45.297 --> 13:47.030
Hey, that's great.

13:47.032 --> 13:49.332
- Are you considering it?
- No.

13:50.567 --> 13:52.168
- No.
- Why not?

13:52.170 --> 13:55.138
Because I'm just not sure that
that's my world anymore,

13:55.140 --> 13:56.973
and I like the practice
that I've built here,

13:56.975 --> 13:59.142
and my girls need me, so...

13:59.144 --> 14:00.943
Is that why
you're always complaining

14:00.945 --> 14:03.012
about how boring
your caseload is?

14:03.014 --> 14:04.847
I do not do that.

14:04.849 --> 14:06.716
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, I'm sorry,

14:06.718 --> 14:08.618
but I don't care if
Mr. Etheridge's property line

14:08.620 --> 14:10.753
may extend by 5 feet
at the side.

14:10.755 --> 14:12.522
- I...
- Exactly.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.759
- But the girls...
- Are doing great,

14:16.761 --> 14:19.128
and probably don't want
you hanging around all the time,

14:19.130 --> 14:20.897
checking up on them.

14:20.899 --> 14:22.999
Did you like the work?

14:24.601 --> 14:26.602
It was exciting.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.538
I loved closing a deal.
I mean, the rush...

14:29.540 --> 14:32.408
So maybe you should
think about it.

14:32.410 --> 14:34.844
I'm sure you can find that guy
in you again.

14:34.846 --> 14:36.479
Maybe.

14:36.481 --> 14:41.317
I'm trying to imagine you as
some hotshot killer lawyer.

14:41.319 --> 14:42.551
I was a badass.

14:42.553 --> 14:44.053
Really?

14:44.055 --> 14:46.255
Mm-hmm.

14:49.126 --> 14:50.326
That'll be $5.75.

14:53.764 --> 14:56.332
Sebastian.
What a nice surprise.

14:57.234 --> 14:58.901
I love surprises,
don't you?

14:58.903 --> 15:00.336
Yeah, sure, Mrs. Donovan.

15:00.338 --> 15:01.804
Please, it's Vicky.

15:01.806 --> 15:03.238
And I wish you'd give me
those golf lessons

15:03.240 --> 15:04.907
I've been asking you for.

15:04.909 --> 15:07.443
I've told you, Mrs. Donovan,
I'm not much of a golfer.

15:07.445 --> 15:09.912
But I'm sure they have a pro
at the club.

15:09.914 --> 15:11.647
But you seem like
such a natural.

15:11.649 --> 15:15.150
I've seen you on the green.
You got great hands.

15:16.119 --> 15:18.520
Thank you,
but my answer's still no.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.491
I'm just looking
for something fun,

15:22.493 --> 15:23.959
light,

15:23.961 --> 15:26.929
no strings attached
'cause I'm already attached.

15:26.931 --> 15:28.931
That's just not really
my thing.

15:28.933 --> 15:32.668
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.770
Have a good afternoon,
Mrs. Donovan.

15:34.772 --> 15:36.605
It's Vicky.

15:39.677 --> 15:43.378
These designs are
the chicest of the chic.

15:43.380 --> 15:45.547
Stylish, innovative,

15:45.549 --> 15:47.516
every one a work of art.

15:47.518 --> 15:48.650
Oh.

15:48.652 --> 15:50.619
And now
for our dear Carrie...

15:52.356 --> 15:54.289
What a sight to behold.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.291
The simple lines,

15:56.293 --> 15:57.893
the calming texture.

15:57.895 --> 16:00.395
Issey Miyake plus
Carrie Bradshaw equals Zen,

16:00.397 --> 16:01.997
if ever I saw it.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.265
You think so?

16:03.267 --> 16:05.200
You would rock the halls
of Castlebury in that, Carrie.

16:05.202 --> 16:07.903
As in, "This is a Miyake,
so don't try and stop me."

16:09.172 --> 16:10.672
You want her to wear pajamas
to school?

16:10.674 --> 16:12.574
Excuse me?

16:12.576 --> 16:13.875
I think my mother wore
something like that

16:13.877 --> 16:15.910
when she burnt our trailer down
with her cigarette.

16:15.912 --> 16:17.712
It's avant-garde couture.

16:17.714 --> 16:18.747
It's ridiculous.

16:18.749 --> 16:20.815
No man wants to see a woman
in <i>that.</i>

16:20.817 --> 16:23.952
Oh, no self-respecting woman
dresses for men.

16:23.954 --> 16:26.054
Women dress
for other women.

16:26.056 --> 16:28.590
Or gay men. Case in point...
You boys like it, right?

16:28.592 --> 16:30.125
No wonder
none of you get laid.

16:30.127 --> 16:31.926
In an outfit like that, no one
would wanna have sex with you.

16:31.928 --> 16:33.862
Oh, you're so wrong.

16:33.864 --> 16:35.897
The right type of man would
absolutely wanna have sex

16:35.899 --> 16:37.131
with a woman in this.

16:37.133 --> 16:38.700
Well, if by the "Right man"
you mean a gay man,

16:38.702 --> 16:41.002
he would only wanna make love
to the <i>outfit,</i> not you.

16:41.004 --> 16:42.370
How much is this?

16:42.372 --> 16:45.073
Why did I ever
think these two would get along?

16:45.075 --> 16:46.741
- This is going...
- Exactly as I expected.

16:46.743 --> 16:48.743
- They hate each other.
- $800?!

16:48.745 --> 16:50.478
I could buy a house
for that.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.447
Mm, one of those trailers
you like so much?

16:52.449 --> 16:55.316
Well, at least I'm being me
and not some pretentious poseur.

16:55.318 --> 16:56.684
Ugh, you have no room
to speak,

16:56.686 --> 16:59.620
especially considering you look
like a tired old slag.

16:59.622 --> 17:02.657
<i>This</i> is a beautiful creation,
and it is perfect for Carrie.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.460
Sake, waketake,
sock-it-to-me.

17:05.462 --> 17:06.894
Sake, waketake,
sock-it-to-me.

17:06.896 --> 17:09.096
I'm sorry. Are you threatening
to sock me?

17:09.098 --> 17:10.932
Because you don't
wanna mess with me.

17:10.934 --> 17:13.367
- No. No, I don't wanna mess with you.
- This is not good.

17:13.368 --> 17:15.202
- I want you...
- Here's what's going to happen.

17:15.204 --> 17:16.771
Larissa's head is going
to pop off.

17:16.772 --> 17:19.540
Samantha is going to break
something incredibly expensive.

17:19.541 --> 17:21.008
We're all gonna get
kicked out of here,

17:21.010 --> 17:23.243
and my job at "Interview"
will be over.

17:23.246 --> 17:25.913
I need to get in there
and defuse this now.

17:25.915 --> 17:28.616
Well, hold on a minute.
What about being Zen?

17:28.618 --> 17:30.484
You actually have to
stay detached.

17:30.486 --> 17:33.187
Okay. Yeah, yeah,
you're right.

17:33.189 --> 17:35.689
- Um, I just need to stay calm.
- Right.

17:35.691 --> 17:36.857
- Stay calm.
- Yeah.

17:36.859 --> 17:38.125
Yeah.
Think of that gardenia.

17:38.127 --> 17:39.293
Yeah.

17:45.234 --> 17:47.268
Why is it so quiet?

17:50.906 --> 17:52.706
Did they kill each other?

17:52.708 --> 17:54.475
Who's behind
that sexy mask?

17:54.477 --> 17:56.477
Whoa!

17:56.479 --> 17:58.078
He looks acrobatic.

17:59.649 --> 18:01.515
Carrie, dear, look.

18:01.517 --> 18:04.451
This Yamamoto is even more
sublime than the Miyake.

18:04.453 --> 18:05.652
That was beautiful.

18:06.722 --> 18:08.155
See?
The problem fixed itself.

18:08.157 --> 18:09.256
Wow.

18:09.258 --> 18:11.091
Maybe this Zen thing
really does work.

18:11.093 --> 18:12.359
Totally.

18:12.361 --> 18:13.927
And if you were able to detach
and let go of that,

18:13.929 --> 18:15.095
imagine what you're gonna
be able to do

18:15.097 --> 18:16.396
once you're faced
with Sebastian.

18:16.398 --> 18:19.800
I think I'm gonna need
my own mantra.

18:24.028 --> 18:25.489
<i>It was the first day of school,</i>

18:25.491 --> 18:27.725
<i>and my goal was to remain Zen,</i>

18:27.727 --> 18:30.061
<i>calm, detached.</i>

18:30.463 --> 18:33.063
<i>That was the key.</i>

18:33.065 --> 18:35.599
Dorrit! You've been in there
for 20 minutes.

18:35.601 --> 18:38.068
Some of us have to get ready
for school, too.

18:39.705 --> 18:41.238
Dorrit, I'm serious!

18:41.240 --> 18:44.374
This is incredibly selfish
of you.

18:46.111 --> 18:48.378
Easy breezy. Easy peasy.

18:48.380 --> 18:49.846
Easy breezy. Easy...

18:49.848 --> 18:51.081
Can't you wait your turn?

18:51.083 --> 18:53.483
Oh, does my turn come
at midnight?

18:53.485 --> 18:55.519
No. Calm.

18:55.521 --> 18:57.120
Calm.

18:57.122 --> 18:59.156
Easy breezy.
Easy peasy.

18:59.158 --> 19:01.024
- Easy breezy. Easy peasy.
- What in the world are you mumbling?

19:01.026 --> 19:02.592
Actually, I'm chanting.

19:02.594 --> 19:03.660
This is my mantra.

19:03.662 --> 19:05.829
It keeps me in a calm
and detached state.

19:05.831 --> 19:07.330
Well, maybe you
and your detached state

19:07.332 --> 19:09.699
can stop screaming
at the bathroom door.

19:09.701 --> 19:11.968
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

19:11.970 --> 19:13.770
You just take your time
in there.

19:13.772 --> 19:16.206
I was way too attached
to the clock and the time.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.575
Well, you should be.

19:18.577 --> 19:20.076
You're gonna be late
for school.

19:20.078 --> 19:22.178
Really, no hurry.

19:22.180 --> 19:23.213
You go ahead.

19:23.215 --> 19:26.082
I'm just gonna be here
in the moment.

19:28.086 --> 19:31.154
Okay, freak, where exactly
is this coming from?

19:31.156 --> 19:33.356
I've turned a new leaf.

19:33.358 --> 19:34.491
I'm Zen.

19:34.493 --> 19:36.526
Everything just washes
past me,

19:36.528 --> 19:39.262
including people
calling me "Freak"

19:40.799 --> 19:41.898
Super freak.

19:43.702 --> 19:46.002
Again, totally calm.

19:46.004 --> 19:47.637
All is well
with the world.

19:47.639 --> 19:49.606
In fact,
I'm really excited

19:49.608 --> 19:51.608
we're finally going to
the same school together.

19:51.610 --> 19:53.109
Ugh, please.

19:53.111 --> 19:54.811
What? It's a big deal.

19:54.813 --> 19:57.947
The Bradshaw girls in the same
hallowed high school halls.

19:57.949 --> 20:00.416
Whatever.
It's just school.

20:00.418 --> 20:02.352
No, it's more than that
for us.

20:02.354 --> 20:03.920
It's important.

20:03.922 --> 20:05.088
And if you ever need
anything,

20:05.090 --> 20:07.757
you know, maybe some
sisterly advice

20:07.759 --> 20:09.659
or any help
with anything at all,

20:09.661 --> 20:11.894
I'm happy to help.

20:11.896 --> 20:13.463
Oh, that actually
sounds good.

20:13.465 --> 20:15.364
So you'd help me out with
anything I needed at school?

20:15.366 --> 20:17.800
Without question?
Like if something came up?

20:17.802 --> 20:19.202
Yeah.

20:19.204 --> 20:22.338
I'm here for you, Dorrit.

20:22.340 --> 20:23.390
Good.

20:23.510 --> 20:26.688
<i>And as I was preparing to be</i>
<i>Zen for my first day of school</i>

20:26.808 --> 20:29.761
<i>and becoming surprisingly</i>
<i>closer to my sister,</i>

20:29.881 --> 20:32.597
<i>Samantha was waking up to
a surprise of her own.</I></i>

20:39.489 --> 20:41.557
Hey. Where are you going?

20:41.559 --> 20:45.027
I guess I fell asleep
after we had sex last night.

20:45.029 --> 20:46.862
Certainly didn't mean to be here
in the morning.

20:46.864 --> 20:48.664
What's wrong with that?
I wanted to wake up with you.

20:48.666 --> 20:51.901
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:51.903 --> 20:54.436
Well, I know you liked me
in the mask,

20:54.438 --> 20:56.705
but I gotta take it off.
It's too hot.

20:56.707 --> 20:58.040
No, no, no! It's so much hotter
with it on! Don't do that!

21:01.379 --> 21:03.345
Now you've ruined everything.
Where's the mystery?

21:03.347 --> 21:04.546
There's no mystery.

21:04.548 --> 21:07.249
Name's Paul Cunningham.
Iowa state gymnastics team.

21:07.251 --> 21:08.484
Came to New York
to be an actor.

21:08.486 --> 21:10.319
It's getting worse.
Stop talking.

21:10.321 --> 21:12.254
- Just stop talking.
- Wait, wait. Why are you leaving?

21:12.256 --> 21:14.957
Don't you wanna get to know me?
Maybe let me take you out?

21:14.959 --> 21:16.458
No. Don't.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.494
Really. I gotta get out
of here.

21:18.496 --> 21:20.362
No!

21:20.364 --> 21:21.497
Shoo, Ninja!

21:21.499 --> 21:23.932
Shoo!

21:27.471 --> 21:28.837
Hey.

21:28.839 --> 21:30.639
To what do I owe
the surprise visit?

21:32.442 --> 21:34.276
Did you dump Deb? You looking
for a bimbo for the ball?

21:34.278 --> 21:35.777
'Cause I've got some options.

21:35.779 --> 21:38.046
That's still a big "No."
No.

21:39.984 --> 21:41.717
I wanted to talk to you
about your offer.

21:41.719 --> 21:44.486
Ohh! Tom, that is great news!
I knew you'd come around.

21:44.488 --> 21:46.355
All right, now before you get
too excited,

21:46.357 --> 21:48.757
I should warn you...
this won't come cheap.

21:48.759 --> 21:51.660
Like I said, I have a job that
I find extremely rewarding.

21:51.662 --> 21:55.564
My girls are constantly around
and need my attention.

21:55.566 --> 21:57.365
So you're gonna have to
swing hard

21:57.367 --> 21:59.034
if you really want me
to work here.

21:59.036 --> 22:03.171
I hear you
loud and clear, Tommy.

22:33.602 --> 22:38.907
You are a tough negotiator,
Tom Bradshaw.

22:38.909 --> 22:41.409
And that is exactly why
I want you here.

22:41.411 --> 22:42.977
Congratulations.

22:42.979 --> 22:44.145
Mm.

22:44.147 --> 22:46.814
You know, you could've asked
for about 10% more.

22:46.816 --> 22:47.916
Oh, I know.

22:47.918 --> 22:49.918
No, I, uh, am agreeing
to work for less

22:49.920 --> 22:52.487
because I have a few deal points
that are non-negotiable.

22:52.489 --> 22:55.456
Oh. And what if
I say no to them?

22:55.458 --> 22:56.991
Well, then I'll walk away,
no problem.

22:56.993 --> 22:58.192
Okay, what do you got?

22:58.194 --> 22:59.827
I wanna make my own hours.

22:59.829 --> 23:01.195
I don't want one word

23:01.197 --> 23:03.364
if I ever have to drop
everything to be with the kids,

23:03.366 --> 23:05.933
and I wanna be home for dinner
at least three nights a week,

23:05.935 --> 23:07.435
no questions asked.

23:07.437 --> 23:10.671
Oh, and, uh, I also want
season tickets to the Rangers.

23:10.673 --> 23:12.140
Box seats.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.176
Done.

23:15.178 --> 23:16.244
Good.

23:16.246 --> 23:18.012
I hope you're not ruining
those girls.

23:18.014 --> 23:19.313
What, by focusing on them?

23:19.315 --> 23:20.448
Exactly.

23:20.450 --> 23:21.582
They'll be totally screwed up

23:21.584 --> 23:23.551
with crazy expectations
about men.

23:23.553 --> 23:25.553
<i>Ruined</i> for life.

23:31.560 --> 23:32.693
Hey, guys.

23:32.695 --> 23:33.928
Hi.
Hey.

23:33.930 --> 23:35.296
What are you
in a sports Jersey?

23:35.298 --> 23:38.399
Oh, it's like my straight armor.
It's my way to be a Ninja.

23:38.401 --> 23:39.967
Oh. That's a good idea.

23:39.969 --> 23:41.202
It was mine.

23:41.204 --> 23:43.738
So you ready for our first day
of senior year?

23:43.740 --> 23:45.106
Sure.

23:45.108 --> 23:46.874
You don't sound too happy
about it.

23:46.876 --> 23:48.042
No. I'm... I'm good.

23:48.044 --> 23:51.145
- I'm practicing remaining calm, detached.
- Oh.

23:52.281 --> 23:54.415
Ahh.
How am I doing?

23:54.417 --> 23:56.283
Totally Zen.

23:57.420 --> 23:58.619
Carrie, can we talk?

23:58.621 --> 24:01.522
Whoa! You're actually talking
to me?

24:01.524 --> 24:03.190
I figured you'd just ignore me
the whole year.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.326
Normally, I would,
but I need your help.

24:05.328 --> 24:07.027
I'm in Mr. O'Neal's
English class.

24:07.029 --> 24:09.029
Oh, he's the worst.
And his breath...

24:09.031 --> 24:10.831
I know. I really wanted
Mr. London.

24:10.833 --> 24:12.332
I wouldn't normally
put you out like this,

24:12.334 --> 24:14.368
but you're easily one of
Mr. London's favorite students,

24:14.370 --> 24:15.936
and maybe if
you talked to him...

24:15.938 --> 24:18.138
It's true. I am his favorite.

24:18.140 --> 24:19.273
I'm all over this.

24:19.275 --> 24:20.874
Bye, guys.

24:21.843 --> 24:24.311
Maggie! Happy first day!

24:24.313 --> 24:25.512
Oh. Yeah, I guess.

24:25.514 --> 24:26.880
Hey.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.650
So... how are things going
with the college applications?

24:29.652 --> 24:30.951
Oh, they're fine. It's fine.

24:30.953 --> 24:32.486
Hey, what schools
are you applying to?

24:32.488 --> 24:34.855
Don't even try
it, Walt. It's not gonna happen!

24:35.990 --> 24:37.491
God, I hope she doesn't
out me.

24:37.493 --> 24:39.526
She won't.
Don't let her get you down.

24:39.528 --> 24:41.395
Just try and focus on the good stuff...

24:41.397 --> 24:44.564
Like how your Jersey
is working like a charm.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.932
Check out
Reynolds the Jets fan.

24:45.934 --> 24:48.402
What, the Pats aren't
good enough for you, Reynolds?

24:48.404 --> 24:50.871
Uh, I really like the Pats.

24:50.873 --> 24:53.240
I... mean, those are
two great guys.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.708
What?

24:54.710 --> 24:56.810
"Pats" are short
for "Patriots," a team.

24:56.812 --> 24:58.833
I have to stop talking
and get out of here.

24:58.953 --> 24:59.475
And fast.

24:59.595 --> 25:00.881
Bye, guys!

25:02.917 --> 25:05.352
One thing you need to know is
that Mr. London is tough,

25:05.354 --> 25:08.021
but he's fair.
He just wants you to...

25:09.390 --> 25:11.858
I lied. Sorry.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.294
What's happening?

25:21.596 --> 25:23.948
You have some nerve,
standing there

25:23.950 --> 25:26.584
with your sparkly bedroom eyes

25:26.586 --> 25:29.220
and your cute floppy hair.

25:29.222 --> 25:31.222
Do you have a problem
with my eyes?

25:31.224 --> 25:33.591
Yes. They're too...

25:33.593 --> 25:35.226
sparkly and...

25:35.228 --> 25:36.560
inscrutable.

25:36.562 --> 25:38.095
They're just annoying.

25:38.097 --> 25:39.463
Are they bothering you?

25:39.465 --> 25:41.098
I just said they were.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.434
Everything about you
is bothering me.

25:43.436 --> 25:44.602
Oh, is it?

25:44.604 --> 25:46.937
You are not gonna get to me.

25:46.939 --> 25:49.039
I am calm,

25:49.041 --> 25:50.741
detached.

25:50.743 --> 25:53.143
I'm totally Zen.

25:53.145 --> 25:54.478
I feel nothing for you.

25:54.480 --> 25:57.281
Nothing, huh?

25:57.283 --> 25:59.650
Nothing.

26:11.963 --> 26:14.498
Excuse me!

26:14.500 --> 26:16.133
Oh!

26:16.135 --> 26:19.670
What exactly is going on here?

26:19.672 --> 26:21.105
Um... I can explain.

26:21.107 --> 26:24.308
That was a rhetorical question,
Carrie.

26:24.310 --> 26:25.609
You do remember
what "rhetorical" means

26:25.611 --> 26:26.777
from my class, don't you?

26:26.779 --> 26:28.846
Listen, just... this wasn't
her fault.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.881
I'm... you can explain it
all to the principal.

26:32.751 --> 26:34.484
Oh!

26:34.486 --> 26:37.654
I am so sorry, Mr. London.

26:46.631 --> 26:48.832
How are those college
applications going, Maggie?

26:48.834 --> 26:50.700
Um, they're not going.

26:50.702 --> 26:52.069
It's too hard filling out
those forms.

26:52.071 --> 26:54.738
Yes. Using a pen
is challenging.

26:54.740 --> 26:55.939
Look, the stupid forms
are confusing, okay?

26:55.941 --> 26:57.374
There's too many questions.

26:57.376 --> 26:59.376
Like "What is your name?"
and "What's your birth date?"

26:59.378 --> 27:00.744
It's a waste of time.

27:00.746 --> 27:02.812
It's not like I have some
awesome future waiting for me.

27:02.814 --> 27:04.814
Well, you won't havene at all
if you don't try.

27:04.816 --> 27:05.916
I can't believe

27:05.918 --> 27:07.984
I put more effort and work
into this than you.

27:07.986 --> 27:09.452
Wow.

27:09.454 --> 27:11.321
Don't waste your time on me.
Nobody asked you to.

27:11.323 --> 27:13.690
You know what, Maggie?

27:13.692 --> 27:15.759
The reason people get
so fed up with you

27:15.761 --> 27:17.727
is because you won't take
any responsibility for yourself.

27:17.729 --> 27:19.963
What, like how Walt
made a fool of me?

27:19.965 --> 27:22.432
Do you have any idea what
this is like for Walt?

27:22.434 --> 27:23.900
Trying to figure out
who he is

27:23.902 --> 27:26.469
while making sure
no one else here does?

27:26.471 --> 27:30.240
He is wearing a sports jersey,
for God sakes.

27:30.242 --> 27:31.975
Take a look around.

27:31.977 --> 27:33.977
People are
going through stuff.

27:44.021 --> 27:45.555
Hey.

27:45.557 --> 27:47.223
English lady.
What are you doing here?

27:47.225 --> 27:49.158
No takers at
your usual corner today?

27:49.160 --> 27:51.327
Mm. I just came
to see Carrie.

27:51.329 --> 27:52.795
Carrie isn't here.
She's off at that place with

27:52.797 --> 27:55.531
all the lockers and the bells
and the people running about.

27:55.533 --> 27:56.599
A train station?

27:56.601 --> 27:58.501
No. High school.

27:58.503 --> 28:00.970
But I wouldn't put it past you
not to be familiar.

28:00.972 --> 28:02.338
I forgot
Carrie went to school.

28:02.340 --> 28:04.207
Got so used to seeing her
every day.

28:04.209 --> 28:06.242
I actually used to come visit
her here during the summer.

28:06.244 --> 28:08.711
I sat right there,
<i>on your desk.</i>

28:08.713 --> 28:11.514
Why does it not surprise me
that a tawdry wannabe like you

28:11.516 --> 28:12.849
would try and get
in the good graces

28:12.851 --> 28:14.517
of someone who works
at "Interview"?

28:14.519 --> 28:16.052
You've got
to be kidding.

28:16.054 --> 28:18.354
I could give a rat's ass
about your magazine.

28:18.356 --> 28:19.455
I've never even read it.

28:19.457 --> 28:21.057
Besides, everyone here
looks like

28:21.059 --> 28:22.358
they're straight out
of the circus.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.694
Why did you come here?
And why are you still here?

28:24.696 --> 28:26.896
I just wanted to tell Carrie
about my Ninja adventure.

28:26.898 --> 28:29.565
I slept with that guy
from Youshi... whatever,

28:29.567 --> 28:31.300
and now he's wanting
to take me out.

28:31.302 --> 28:32.702
So lame. Can you believe it?

28:32.704 --> 28:34.937
Hmm, that someone would like
to get to know you?

28:34.939 --> 28:36.405
Yes,
that does sound dubious.

28:36.407 --> 28:39.275
Please. You have idea
who I am.

28:39.277 --> 28:40.476
Oh, don't I? Let's see.

28:40.478 --> 28:42.845
You pretend to be above
the idea of commitment,

28:42.847 --> 28:44.346
thinking you are
so much better

28:44.348 --> 28:45.614
than all those men
you sleep with.

28:45.616 --> 28:48.684
But the truth is,
you're just afraid to connect.

28:48.686 --> 28:51.487
You are scared to death
of being left out in the dust

28:51.489 --> 28:52.755
by some guy who realizes

28:52.757 --> 28:56.926
you're just a loud hillbilly
with zero future.

28:56.928 --> 28:59.662
That couldn't be further
from the truth.

28:59.664 --> 29:00.963
I'm not afraid of commitment.

29:00.965 --> 29:03.499
In fact, I came here to get
that address of that Festival

29:03.501 --> 29:05.901
from Carrie, so I could go see
my Ninja boy.

29:05.903 --> 29:07.603
I just couldn't remember
where it was at.

29:09.439 --> 29:10.906
You just...

29:14.778 --> 29:15.811
Here you go.

29:15.813 --> 29:17.379
Thanks, honey.

29:20.251 --> 29:21.783
Sake, waketake,
sock-it-to-me.

29:21.785 --> 29:23.819
Sake, waketake, sock-it-to-me.

29:26.624 --> 29:30.592
Hey, look who it is.
Reynolds the Jets fan.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.294
I'm not really
that big a fan.

29:32.296 --> 29:34.363
You saying
you don't love football?

29:34.365 --> 29:35.364
No, no! I-it's just...

29:35.366 --> 29:36.732
You'll have to
talk shop later, boys.

29:36.734 --> 29:38.967
I'm gonna take Walt now.

29:40.303 --> 29:42.337
How's it going?
Are you doing okay?

29:42.339 --> 29:43.805
I guess.

29:43.807 --> 29:45.240
I've just never been called
"Reynolds" so much in my life.

29:45.242 --> 29:47.509
Please tell me you're not trying
to talk sports with the jocks.

29:47.511 --> 29:49.544
Well... are you trying
to get yourself killed?

29:49.546 --> 29:51.179
I...

29:52.281 --> 29:53.415
Mmm.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.550
What are you doing?

29:55.552 --> 29:56.885
Just stick with me.

29:56.887 --> 29:59.154
I'm the only one equipped
to keep you under the gaydar.

29:59.156 --> 30:00.956
Gaydar?
Yeah, I just made it up.

30:00.958 --> 30:02.090
Mmm!

30:02.092 --> 30:03.425
I'm not so sure
that'll stick.

30:03.427 --> 30:07.729
Mmm. Mmm. <i>Mmm.</i>

30:07.731 --> 30:10.632
See? Now no one will think
you're gay.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.434
But aren't you dating
one of those guys?

30:13.436 --> 30:14.803
- Oops.
- Oops?

30:14.805 --> 30:17.605
Uh... oh! What are you doing
with my girl, Reynolds?

30:20.242 --> 30:22.577
Do you realize I've never been
sent to the principal's office

30:22.579 --> 30:24.245
in all my 12 years of school?

30:24.247 --> 30:25.380
And here I am,

30:25.382 --> 30:29.017
before lunch on my first day
of my senior year.

30:29.019 --> 30:32.420
If I get suspended and lose
my internship over this,

30:32.422 --> 30:34.489
I'm holding you responsible.

30:34.491 --> 30:36.925
<i>You</i> kissed <i>me.</i>
I just wanted to talk.

30:36.927 --> 30:38.359
Oh, so it's <i>my</i> fault?

30:38.361 --> 30:41.596
I'm not taking
all the blame here, buddy.

30:41.598 --> 30:44.732
How you can just sit there
all calm and cool like always

30:44.734 --> 30:46.134
is beyond me.

30:46.136 --> 30:47.568
I'm not calm.

30:47.570 --> 30:50.238
Being without you
is ripping me to shreds.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.510
Oh.

30:59.548 --> 31:01.082
How did we get here?

31:04.119 --> 31:07.288
All I wanted was to be Zen,

31:07.290 --> 31:08.789
like the gardenia.

31:08.791 --> 31:10.625
The flower?

31:11.894 --> 31:15.863
I saw this beautiful gardenia
in the city,

31:15.865 --> 31:18.866
floating in a glass box.

31:18.868 --> 31:23.270
It was so simple and clean,
and it smelled so good.

31:23.272 --> 31:26.741
I just wanted that to be me.

31:26.743 --> 31:29.043
That <i>is</i> you.

31:29.045 --> 31:31.312
No, it's not.

31:31.314 --> 31:32.880
No.

31:32.882 --> 31:37.218
With you, I'm just a jumbled
mess of pain and emotions.

31:37.220 --> 31:40.120
Any time we're together,
it's chaos.

31:40.122 --> 31:43.958
Nothing about us is simple.

31:46.127 --> 31:49.563
I'll never be the gardenia.

31:49.565 --> 31:50.931
Never.

32:10.916 --> 32:12.983
Lucky for you,
I'm not suspended.

32:12.985 --> 32:15.685
Not that afterschool detention
all next week is much better.

32:15.687 --> 32:17.942
I'm not the one who was tearing
off her clothes in a classroom.

32:18.062 --> 32:19.781
You heard?

32:19.901 --> 32:22.976
Dorrit, why did you even
help Sebastian like that?

32:22.978 --> 32:24.678
Because he really likes you.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.780
And it's super annoying
watching you

32:26.782 --> 32:28.015
mope around all the time
because of him.

32:28.017 --> 32:30.150
Well, that wasn't your call
to make.

32:30.152 --> 32:31.418
You know,

32:31.420 --> 32:35.155
for the less screwed-up sister,
you sure are a mess.

32:35.157 --> 32:36.857
I have a lot going on.

32:36.859 --> 32:38.492
In your head.

32:38.494 --> 32:41.194
Get out of it and just go after
what you want.

32:41.196 --> 32:43.297
That's what I do.

32:43.299 --> 32:45.632
The trouble is,
I've been thinking so much,

32:45.634 --> 32:49.336
I don't know what I want
anymore.

32:53.674 --> 32:55.642
Excuse me, Ninja?

32:55.644 --> 32:56.943
Ninja boy.

33:00.849 --> 33:02.382
So here's the thing.

33:02.384 --> 33:04.217
I know I was pretty awful
to you this morning

33:04.219 --> 33:05.619
and pretty much
ran out on you.

33:05.621 --> 33:07.387
And at the time,
I thought that was a good thing.

33:07.389 --> 33:10.991
But I've been doing
some thinking, and...

33:10.993 --> 33:13.860
This isn't the easiest thing
for me to say, but...

33:13.862 --> 33:16.296
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad
if we saw more of each other.

33:16.298 --> 33:17.931
After all,
the sex was fantastic.

33:17.933 --> 33:20.834
And if you'd keep the mask on
from time to time

33:20.836 --> 33:23.003
and maybe
put me up in your place

33:23.005 --> 33:25.171
when I need somewhere
to crash,

33:25.173 --> 33:27.307
I don't see why we couldn't
get to know each other a little.

33:27.309 --> 33:30.577
So... yeah.
What do you say?

33:33.714 --> 33:36.149
I not sure I understand.

33:36.151 --> 33:38.318
Oh.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.452
Not who I was expecting.

33:39.454 --> 33:42.322
Sorry? I not speak English.

33:42.324 --> 33:45.925
Well, then, I think
this conversation went great.

33:47.328 --> 33:49.562
I'm glad everything worked out
so well.

33:49.564 --> 33:50.663
Yeah.

33:50.665 --> 33:51.898
Human resources got you
all squared away?

33:51.900 --> 33:53.066
Oh, it'll be such a relief

33:53.068 --> 33:54.934
to have somebody else
doing the billing for me.

33:54.936 --> 33:56.703
Well, it'll be nice
to have you around.

33:56.705 --> 33:58.204
From one Bradshaw
to another.

33:58.206 --> 34:00.173
You are following in
your daughter's footsteps.

34:00.175 --> 34:01.541
With a corner office

34:01.543 --> 34:03.076
and season tickets
to the Rangers.

34:03.078 --> 34:06.679
Ohh, I'm really looking forward
to those Rangers tickets.

34:06.681 --> 34:09.514
I guess I'm gonna need a few
more Armani power ties, huh?

34:09.516 --> 34:13.018
Yes, you will.
Barracudas only wear Armani.

34:14.289 --> 34:16.022
I'm a barracuda again.

34:17.024 --> 34:19.492
Well, I just, uh, I need
to grab my briefcase,

34:19.494 --> 34:21.726
- and then I'll be on my way.
- Yeah.

34:25.699 --> 34:27.065
I'm so glad
you came back.

34:27.068 --> 34:28.833
Mmm.

34:28.835 --> 34:30.735
Do you want me to talk
dirty Japanese to you?

34:30.737 --> 34:32.705
Oh, yeah! Please talk dirty.
Huh? Do you?

34:32.706 --> 34:34.572
Yeah. Dirty Japanese.
Mmm! Ohh!

34:34.574 --> 34:37.342
I love dirty Japanese.

34:38.545 --> 34:39.678
I...

34:39.679 --> 34:41.781
I didn't realize that
they were still...

34:42.984 --> 34:44.116
Dating.

34:44.118 --> 34:48.353
Yeah. They... can't seem
to let go of each other.

34:48.356 --> 34:50.556
- My jacket is still in there.
- Leave it.

34:50.558 --> 34:53.025
I'll... I'll have it
dry cleaned.

34:53.027 --> 34:54.326
Or incinerated.

35:06.407 --> 35:08.374
Um, Walt, c-can we talk?

35:08.376 --> 35:09.875
You've caused enough trouble
for Walt.

35:09.877 --> 35:11.777
Turn around and walk away,
and no one gets hurt.

35:11.779 --> 35:13.379
Uh, not that it's
any of your business,

35:13.381 --> 35:15.247
but I came here to apologize.

35:16.216 --> 35:17.950
Oh.

35:17.952 --> 35:19.751
Oh, then by all means,
take a seat.

35:19.753 --> 35:21.887
Privately.

35:21.889 --> 35:23.755
It's okay.

35:23.757 --> 35:25.224
I'll be fine.

35:25.226 --> 35:27.359
I think I can take her.

35:28.595 --> 35:31.063
All right, well,
I'll be right over there,

35:31.065 --> 35:32.431
talking to
the new wrestling captain,

35:32.433 --> 35:34.099
if you need me.

35:34.101 --> 35:35.867
I don't trust this one.

35:46.679 --> 35:47.846
You've got quite a shiner.

35:47.848 --> 35:48.980
Yeah.

35:48.982 --> 35:51.883
I kinda can't feel
the left side of my face.

35:51.885 --> 35:53.752
I couldn't believe
that guy hit you.

35:53.754 --> 35:55.420
Believe it.

35:55.422 --> 35:57.189
Did he do it
'cause you're, um,

35:57.191 --> 35:59.624
- you know...
-  gay?

35:59.626 --> 36:01.793
No. He thought Donna and I
were fooling around,

36:01.795 --> 36:03.328
and he was jealous.

36:03.330 --> 36:04.596
It's funny.

36:04.598 --> 36:06.665
I was so worried about
getting beat up or harassed

36:06.667 --> 36:07.966
for being gay,

36:07.968 --> 36:11.136
and instead I get pounded
for trying to act straight.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.674
You know, I-I'm sorry, Walt,

36:15.676 --> 36:17.042
for everything.

36:17.044 --> 36:19.744
I didn't really think about how
difficult this must be for you.

36:19.746 --> 36:23.648
I felt so bad
that you didn't love me,

36:23.650 --> 36:24.916
and I let it get in the way.

36:24.918 --> 36:26.317
Maggie, I <i>do</i> love you.

36:26.319 --> 36:29.320
I know.
Just not in that way.

36:29.322 --> 36:31.222
But that...

36:31.224 --> 36:32.757
has nothing to do with you.

36:32.759 --> 36:35.226
You have to stop thinking
of yourself as unworthy.

36:35.228 --> 36:38.029
You deserve to have someone
that loves you,

36:38.031 --> 36:42.000
someone really great who
you can have a future with.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.136
Thanks for that.

36:46.238 --> 36:48.840
You're a good friend.
You deserve that, too.

36:50.743 --> 36:53.311
I'm sure this year is not
going to be easy.

36:53.313 --> 36:57.315
But there's only...

36:57.317 --> 36:59.717
271 days to go.

36:59.719 --> 37:02.854
So I'm pretty sure
I can make it.

37:02.856 --> 37:06.023
Well, I'll help where I can.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.264
<i>They say a clear desk creates</i>
<i>a clear mind,</i>

37:13.266 --> 37:15.299
<i>but mine was still a jumble.</i>

37:15.301 --> 37:17.568
<i>What I needed was a sign</i>
<i>telling me what to do.</i>

37:22.574 --> 37:26.377
Oh. Hi.

37:26.379 --> 37:30.381
<i>And there it was... my sign.</i>

37:41.118 --> 37:42.451
I'm really glad
you're here.

37:42.453 --> 37:45.187
Um, there's something
I wanted to tell you.

37:45.189 --> 37:48.991
Um, actually, I'd like to say
something first, if that's okay.

37:48.993 --> 37:51.594
Okay.

37:51.596 --> 37:54.730
I just want to tell you that

37:54.732 --> 37:56.365
I'm sorry for everything.

37:56.367 --> 37:58.767
I'm sorry
I got you in trouble today.

37:58.769 --> 38:01.237
I'm sorry for what happened
with Maggie.

38:01.239 --> 38:04.907
I'm sorry for ruining
your trust.

38:04.909 --> 38:06.909
I'm sorry for everything
I ever put you through.

38:06.911 --> 38:09.678
Thank you.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.481
All I do is make things crazy
for you,

38:12.483 --> 38:15.684
and I want things
to be simpler for you,

38:15.686 --> 38:19.288
like that flower
you were talking about.

38:19.290 --> 38:21.056
The gardenia.

38:21.058 --> 38:24.159
I don't want to stand
in your way anymore, Carrie.

38:24.161 --> 38:26.895
So... I'm gonna let you go.

38:26.897 --> 38:30.132
And I won't keep fighting you.

38:30.134 --> 38:32.267
I know it's over.

38:32.269 --> 38:34.236
Okay.

38:34.238 --> 38:36.238
I'm sure
I'll see you around.

38:41.244 --> 38:44.613
<i>For a brief second, I thought</i>
<i>about fighting for him.</i>

38:44.615 --> 38:47.516
<i>But then,</i>
<i>in a moment of clarity,</i>

38:47.518 --> 38:49.284
<i>I knew he was right.</i>

38:49.286 --> 38:51.453
<i>Maybe our present</i>
<i>did not include each other,</i>

38:51.455 --> 38:53.622
<i>and we had to let go.</i>

38:53.624 --> 38:55.023
<i>Detach.</i>

38:56.426 --> 38:58.160
Hey.

38:58.162 --> 38:59.428
I got a half an hour.

38:59.430 --> 39:00.595
Wanna go for a ride?

39:00.597 --> 39:02.063
Wow. Whole half-hour?

39:02.065 --> 39:04.166
If I remember, you only need
10 minutes.

39:04.168 --> 39:06.768
What's wrong with you?

39:06.770 --> 39:09.004
- You're engaged.
- Never stopped you before.

39:09.006 --> 39:10.772
Yeah, well...

39:10.774 --> 39:12.941
Maybe I've decided
that I deserve better.

39:15.913 --> 39:17.679
Well, so are we go do this
or what?

39:17.681 --> 39:20.181
I don't think so. No.

39:20.183 --> 39:21.650
Are you serious?

39:21.652 --> 39:23.585
Way more serious than
you ever took me, Simon.

39:23.587 --> 39:25.654
I think I would rather
spend my time

39:25.656 --> 39:28.189
with someone who actually thinks
I deserve a future.

39:30.427 --> 39:31.860
Whatever.

39:31.862 --> 39:33.695
It's your loss.

39:33.697 --> 39:36.264
<i>Being Zen can mean many things,</i>

39:36.266 --> 39:40.101
<i>like finding a calm</i>
<i>within yourself.</i>

39:40.103 --> 39:42.437
<i>It can also be about</i>
<i>living in the moment,</i>

39:42.439 --> 39:44.539
<i>not worrying about the future.</i>

39:46.276 --> 39:48.209
So what changed your mind?

39:48.211 --> 39:49.677
Why'd you finally agree
to get together?

39:49.679 --> 39:51.613
Feels like
"No strings attached"

39:51.615 --> 39:53.615
might be just the game
I'm looking for.

39:53.617 --> 39:55.450
Well...

39:55.452 --> 39:57.919
I'm really glad
you decided to play.

39:57.921 --> 40:00.421
