do it justice.

02:32.440 --> 02:35.280
- Oh.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.920
- l sense danger.
- It's fine.

02:43.080 --> 02:43.960
l'm fine.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.160
- Were you carsick?

02:45.320 --> 02:46.840
- Of course not
Of course l wasn't carsick.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
That's—

02:48.160 --> 02:49.680
- Richard, l'm not sure
you fully understand

02:49.840 --> 02:51.000
what you're walking into here.

02:51.160 --> 02:54.200
There are countless unknowns.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.800
- l can handle this, okay?

02:55.960 --> 02:56.720
Please, just give me
some credit

02:56.880 --> 02:57.800
- There's gonna be crying.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.080
- l'm having trouble believing
how great this is.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.800
You comin'?

03:06.960 --> 03:08.120
Whoa!
Good Lord.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.960
Claire.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.960
- Oh, poor thing.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.200
Well, at least it was quick.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.920
lt's a clean thoracic tear.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.240
- We should give him
a proper buriaI.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.640
l feel like l just lost
my bearings.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.480
- Oh, thanks.

03:40.640 --> 03:44.600
- Yeah.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.840
Oh, this is charming.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.120
Oh, the water works.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.760
Good.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.400
l don't know if the stove works.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.600
Maybe they have take-out menus.

04:10.760 --> 04:11.800
- Ah, listen!

04:11.960 --> 04:14.600
Come here, come here, come here.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.480
There she is, the mighty sea.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.120
Still in there.

04:18.279 --> 04:19.079
- Wow.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.440
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.680
- That's so—that's—

04:22.840 --> 04:23.640
l'm gonna look around.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.840
- Oh, they've got plenty
of toweIs.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.440
We didn't need to bring any.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.520
Oh, well.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.480
The fuse box is in
the linen closet, Richard.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.520
Oh, there's a skylight

04:45.680 --> 04:47.640
Richard?

04:52.240 --> 04:55.000
- The couch

04:55.160 --> 04:57.280
could be a problem.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.760
- Don't fixate.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.560
- You're right

05:00.720 --> 05:01.960
Wonderful, everything.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.200
- Good, that's right

05:03.360 --> 05:06.240
You want to grab the luggage
out of the car?

05:06.400 --> 05:10.480
l'll do it

05:10.640 --> 05:13.800
- Phil Turley
is very concerned, Claire,

05:13.960 --> 05:16.960
about the community's efforts
to protect the nesting grounds

05:17.120 --> 05:18.600
of the native tern.

05:18.760 --> 05:22.080
As he should be.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.520
- Listen, l put all
my numbers

05:23.680 --> 05:25.600
on the top sheet
of that memo pad by the phone,

05:25.760 --> 05:28.520
so if you want to tear that off
and tape it up somewhere.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.880
l'm in surgery from 9:00
tiII noon.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.800
So l'll check in after that,
okay?

05:32.960 --> 05:34.360
- Great, good.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.160
- Are you sure you don't want
to rent a car?

05:40.320 --> 05:41.720
- Didn't they say there was
a bike?

05:41.880 --> 05:42.760
l'll dig it out of the garage.

05:42.920 --> 05:43.720
lt's ten minutes to town.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.400
This will be ideal.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.880
- Okay, it's up to you.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.360
- So what does your schedule
Iook Iike for tomorrow?

05:55.520 --> 05:57.520
- I'II start
at the very beginning.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.120
That's a very good place
to start.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.600
- Speaking of which...

06:01.760 --> 06:03.240
Close your eyes.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.400
Okay, you can open them.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.760
- Oh.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.000
- Mark just got one of these.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.400
He said a five-year-old
couId use it

06:18.560 --> 06:20.080
- Richard, use your words.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.280
- ActuaIIy, I was thinking
of writing on the Corona.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.960
- Oh.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.440
- No, but this is good.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.680
No, this is—
you're right

06:27.840 --> 06:30.760
This is better.

06:30.920 --> 06:31.920
- Yeah.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.040
Okay.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.320
- Richard.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.040
These fabrics.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.280
- Oh, l talked to Peter
and Lucy,

06:59.440 --> 07:01.520
and they said they might come
out the weekend of the 2nd.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.160
- Great, great

07:03.320 --> 07:05.560
Who?

07:05.720 --> 07:07.080
- Peter and Lucy?

07:07.240 --> 07:08.040
- Oh, good, yeah.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.320
They're always fun.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.360
- Yeah, yeah.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.800
You didn't bring—

07:13.960 --> 07:18.280
you didn't bring him out here,
did you?

07:18.440 --> 07:19.360
- What?
No.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.120
No, of course not

07:21.280 --> 07:24.800
- No. Okay.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.360
All right

07:29.720 --> 07:32.920
Have a productive week, okay?

07:35.840 --> 07:39.360
- Save some lives!

08:15.040 --> 08:16.520
ding!

08:19.840 --> 08:21.520
beep!

08:47.760 --> 08:48.840
- Hot wheels.

08:49.000 --> 08:49.800
- Let go of me.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.240
- Do you remember the time

08:51.400 --> 08:53.560
that you ran over the neighbor's
guinea pig, Little Fluff?

08:53.720 --> 08:54.520
- No, l do not

08:54.680 --> 08:55.800
Now will you let me go?

08:55.960 --> 08:57.720
- Look, we both know that you're
not equipped to deal

08:57.880 --> 08:59.120
with your current circumstances.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.680
And untiI you prove otherwise,
l feel compelled to be on hand.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.440
- Could you step aside?
l have things to do.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.440
- l sense danger.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.880
- Would you stop saying that?

09:14.920 --> 09:18.560
- Be careful!

anyway?

09:39.680 --> 09:42.520
- 'Cause l'm not

09:50.480 --> 09:52.680
- Later.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.160
- You could so easily
be a cheerIeader.

10:03.320 --> 10:07.320

11:37.880 --> 11:39.200
Oh, no!

11:39.360 --> 11:41.320
No, it's not like that

11:42.720 --> 11:45.440
Hand soap?

11:45.600 --> 11:46.720
- No, it's for your wheels.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.440
The squeaks drive me nuts.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.440
lt's a nice bike, though.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.560

And l need a babysitter.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.840

12:22.000 --> 12:25.120
l thought maybe you might know
somebody who—

12:25.280 --> 12:26.080
- Yeah, okay.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.320
When do you need me for?

12:27.480 --> 12:30.880

12:33.600 --> 12:34.720

12:37.080 --> 12:40.360

12:40.520 --> 12:41.640
I don't know

12:41.800 --> 12:43.080
Sorry.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.800

13:07.800 --> 13:10.320
Merton regarded his solitude

13:16.320 --> 13:19.080
Merton regarded his solitude
as something s—

13:51.560 --> 13:52.360
- Face it

13:52.520 --> 13:53.600
You can't live without me.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.560
- Do you mind?

13:54.720 --> 13:55.920
l'm communing with nature here.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.080
Why are you so incapable
of believing

13:58.240 --> 13:59.960
l can do things perfectly fine
on my own?

14:00.120 --> 14:01.600
- Because you never have.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.560
- Excuse me?

14:02.720 --> 14:04.480
- Oh, Richard, Richard, Richard.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.440
How many times, huh?

14:05.600 --> 14:06.760
Huh?
How many times?

14:06.920 --> 14:08.680
"l'm gonna go through these
baIIet Iessons aIone."

14:08.840 --> 14:10.160
- Do not mock me.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.680
- "I'm gonna, Iike, go through
the college years, like, alone."

14:12.840 --> 14:13.840
- Okay, that—

14:14.000 --> 14:15.240
- "You know, l don't need you,
Captain.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.320
l'm gonna resuscitate
my half-dead marriage alone."

14:17.480 --> 14:18.480
- Zip it
You kindly zip it

14:18.640 --> 14:20.080
- Please, for once in your life,
go it alone.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.680
- GIadIy!
Good day, sir.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.160
- A good day.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.080
- You just don't like it
because l'm on an upswing.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.640
- Oh, my God.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.720
- Merton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

14:38.720 --> 14:39.680
Merton?

14:39.840 --> 14:41.000
Burton.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.800
Milton?
MiIton.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.200
Milton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

14:53.120 --> 14:53.920
- Hey.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.200
Sorry, l'm a little early.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.160
- No, no problem.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.480
l'm sorry, l forgot your name.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.800
- Oh, that's okay.

15:00.960 --> 15:01.760
l forgot yours too,

15:01.920 --> 15:04.800
but l was thinking
that it was Paul

15:04.960 --> 15:07.600
or Steve or Dave, maybe?

15:07.760 --> 15:08.560
- Richard.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.520
- Oh, okay.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.640
That works.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.040
- Oh, here.

15:24.200 --> 15:29.000
lt's a Love-A-Lot for the kid.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.400
- Oh, well...

15:31.760 --> 15:32.680
Actually—

15:32.840 --> 15:34.800
- Um, so you just moved here?

15:34.960 --> 15:36.240
Where from?

15:36.400 --> 15:38.960
- Just the city.

15:39.120 --> 15:39.920
- Oh.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.680
- Yeah, it's only temporary.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.320
My wife Claire is at New York
Presbyterian.

15:44.480 --> 15:45.920
She's a vascular surgeon.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.000
- Oh, wow.

15:48.160 --> 15:48.960
ls that her?

15:49.120 --> 15:50.200
She's cute.

15:50.360 --> 15:53.160
- Oh, yeah, that's the doctor.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.440
- My parents went through
a trial separation once too.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.640
- What?
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

15:56.800 --> 15:57.920
That's not what's happening
here.

15:58.080 --> 15:58.880
No, that's—
no.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.280
That's—

16:01.440 --> 16:02.680
l don't—is it?

16:02.840 --> 16:05.440
- Well, you should probably
find out

16:05.600 --> 16:06.400
- Huh.

16:06.560 --> 16:10.200
- ls it sleeping, the baby?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.640
- The thing about that baby is—

16:12.800 --> 16:13.840
are you thirsty?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.440
- Um, no.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.440
- Oh, look.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.160
The baby is not here.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.120
- What do you mean?

16:22.280 --> 16:25.920
- Basically, l guess,

16:26.080 --> 16:28.280
there is no baby...

16:28.440 --> 16:30.080
as such.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.760
- There's no kid?

16:31.920 --> 16:34.760
- Nope.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.360
- Well, shit

16:38.520 --> 16:39.960
Then this will be easy.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.880
So when do you think
you'II be home?

16:44.040 --> 16:47.840
- Oh, 9:00, 9:30.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.160
- Okay, l got a lot of homework.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.280

18:59.160 --> 19:00.000

19:00.160 --> 19:01.120
- The door was open,

19:01.280 --> 19:03.040
which is extremely unsafe,
by the way.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.120

19:07.040 --> 19:07.880

19:08.040 --> 19:09.080
- You do.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.080
lt's just babysitting.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.640
- Where's the kid?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.320
- He doesn't have a kid.

19:16.880 --> 19:17.760
- Abby, this guy is a perv.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.040
We got to get out of here now.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.400
- Okay, he's a famous writer,
okay?

19:21.560 --> 19:22.760
Get a life.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.320
- You are my life.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.600
You've got a problem with men.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.160
- No, I have got
a problem with you.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.560
- What about Bryce?
- What about him?

19:41.720 --> 19:43.040
- He treats you like shit

19:43.200 --> 19:44.000
- When?
- Always.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.360
- No.
- Yes.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.480
- Shut up.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.520
- Oh, you are not

19:57.680 --> 19:58.800
- l'm not what?

19:58.960 --> 19:59.760
- What are you doing?

19:59.920 --> 20:01.480
- Making soup.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.520
- You've known this stalker guy
five minutes.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.720
You're already making him soup?

20:04.880 --> 20:06.000
- l told you, Christopher.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.160
He is a writer.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.440
- l love you.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.880
- What are you doing out here?

20:17.040 --> 20:18.560
- l told her 9:00, 9:30.

20:18.720 --> 20:22.200
- No, l mean what are you doing
out here with the girI?

20:22.360 --> 20:23.360
- Nothing.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.520
- That doesn't strike you
as odd somehow?

20:25.680 --> 20:27.000
A babysitter?

20:27.160 --> 20:29.640
- l'm under a lot of pressure,
okay, to produce.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.000
People expect literature:

20:32.160 --> 20:33.240
the doctor, my publisher.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.280
l've got three months,

20:34.440 --> 20:36.000
three months to crack
this thing.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.240
- And the girl helps how?

20:38.400 --> 20:40.440
- Was l popular in high school,
in retrospect?

20:40.600 --> 20:42.160
- And the girl helps how?

20:42.320 --> 20:44.840
- Do you have to question
every decision I make?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.280
- Make better decisions.

20:46.440 --> 20:47.520
- Just do the voice.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.240
- Oh.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.240
Oh, now he needs me.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.640
- At this juncture, yes.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.280
- Juncture?
- Yes.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.000
- Oh.
- Yes, just do it

21:11.480 --> 21:13.640
When the world is in peril,

21:13.800 --> 21:17.840
when evil surrounds you,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.680
when danger is lurking,

21:20.840 --> 21:22.040
who do you call?

21:23.200 --> 21:28.000
Captain Excellent!

21:31.280 --> 21:32.760
- l'm bolstered!

21:51.200 --> 21:53.400
There's something out there
in the woods.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.480
- Oh, my God.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.280
The wolf.
Didn't you hear?

21:57.440 --> 21:59.080
lt escaped from the zoo
this morning.

22:00.080 --> 22:00.880
- There's a zoo here?

22:02.040 --> 22:03.920
No, l'm just—

22:06.240 --> 22:08.400
WeII, whatever it is,
l won't let it get you.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.360
Come on, there's soup.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.320
- What?

22:13.480 --> 22:14.720
- Yeah, l made soup.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.200
l thought that you might
be cold.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.680
What did you do tonight?

22:25.840 --> 22:27.680
- l went to the shore,
did some thinking.

22:29.040 --> 22:32.640
- Oh, for three hours
in the freezing cold?

22:32.800 --> 22:34.360
- You made this?

22:34.520 --> 22:35.320
- Yeah.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.400
- How?

22:37.880 --> 22:39.440
- l don't know.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.080
A couple of carrots,

22:41.240 --> 22:44.600
an onion, one of your beers.

22:44.760 --> 22:45.880
Oh, l hope that's okay.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.080
l just kind of helped myself.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.320
- No, it's fantastic.

22:49.480 --> 22:52.440
- Oh, well, you haven't even
tasted it yet

22:52.600 --> 22:56.080
- No, no, no, l mean,
the fact of it is fantastic,

22:56.240 --> 22:58.440
that you made something
from nothing.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.680
- Oh, you can, you know,

23:00.840 --> 23:03.160
kind of make soup
out of anything.

23:03.320 --> 23:06.320
That's the great thing about it

23:06.480 --> 23:08.280
Just whatever's Ieft
laying around, you know.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.840
You can take all the crap

23:11.000 --> 23:13.560
that's rotting in your fridge
and throw out,

23:13.720 --> 23:16.440
or you could toss it into a pot
and make soup out of it

23:16.600 --> 23:18.760
So l go with soup.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.080
Oh.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.920
lt's superb.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.280
- Thank you.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.400
- No, really.

23:29.560 --> 23:31.360
lt's excellent

23:31.520 --> 23:33.240
- Do you remember the moment
when you reaIized

23:33.400 --> 23:35.160
that soup didn't have
to come out of a can,

23:35.320 --> 23:37.240
you know, like all manufactured,

23:37.400 --> 23:38.600
that your chicken noodle
couId kick

23:38.760 --> 23:40.920
Campbell's chicken noodle's ass
any day of the week?

23:41.080 --> 23:43.480
- I think I'm having
that moment right now.

23:45.440 --> 23:48.000
Plus, it's very nutritious,

23:48.160 --> 23:51.960
which is good.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.280
- What—what happened there?

24:03.440 --> 24:04.560
- Oh.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.640
Sorry.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.960
It's just—
it's a boyfriend thing.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.520
Just, um,

24:11.680 --> 24:15.800
the bird kind of reminded me
of him.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.400
He's chickenshit

24:17.560 --> 24:19.360
- Oh.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.800
Actually, it's not a chicken.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.360
lt's the North American
heath hen.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.160
Related to the greater
prairie chicken,

24:24.320 --> 24:25.760
but not technically a chicken.

24:25.920 --> 24:26.720
- Oh.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.000
- lt's extinct now.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.920
The last few lived out here

24:30.080 --> 24:31.840
out on the nature preserve
at Camp Hero.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.400
- Hmm.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.520
l did not know that

24:35.680 --> 24:36.960
- l'm not a birder or anything.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.520
lt's just, the last surviving
heath hen

24:39.680 --> 24:42.360
is a character in...

24:43.480 --> 24:44.440
- ln what?

24:44.600 --> 24:45.560
- That bird's just—

24:45.720 --> 24:47.080
it's the main character of this
book that,

24:47.240 --> 24:51.200
you know, l'm attempting
to produce, to write,

24:51.360 --> 24:53.120
finish.

24:53.280 --> 24:59.200
Actually, to start.

24:59.360 --> 25:03.440
Saying it out loud just sounded
kind of stupid.

25:03.600 --> 25:07.520
-Well, there's Chicken Little,

25:07.680 --> 25:09.520
you know, and Little Red Hen.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.720
- Henny Penny.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.120
- Yeah, exactly.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.080
Exactly.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.880
Oh, you know, there's a lot
of books out there

25:16.040 --> 25:20.280
about poultry.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.160
- We should settle up.

25:27.320 --> 25:30.200
- Okay.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.040
- ls that about right?

25:35.200 --> 25:38.080
- Actually, l'm $12 an hour.

25:38.240 --> 25:42.040
- Oh, okay.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.000
l only have a $10.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.160
Do you have change?

25:44.320 --> 25:47.520
- Let me check.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.080
- So how come your boyfriend's
a chickenshit?

25:51.560 --> 25:52.360
None of my business.

25:52.520 --> 25:55.360
Sorry.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.440
- No, he just—

25:58.600 --> 25:59.960
He just bugs.

26:00.120 --> 26:03.040
You know, it's like when he's
with me, it's all,

26:03.200 --> 26:04.600
"Oh, you know."

26:04.760 --> 26:07.200
And when he's with his friends,
he's all, "Ugh, whatever."

26:07.360 --> 26:09.280
lt's just—you know,
he's a fucking chickenshit

26:09.440 --> 26:13.040
- Right

26:13.200 --> 26:16.040
- Okay, so thank you.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.000
- Mmm-hmm.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.000
Thank you.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.880
Can l ask you a quick question?

26:28.040 --> 26:29.320
- Sure.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.600
- Does this couch
make me look fat?

26:33.760 --> 26:36.480
- l wouldn't sit there.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.520
- Hmm.

26:37.680 --> 26:38.880
- So okay.

26:39.040 --> 26:42.080
Good luck with the chicken book.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.880
- Same time next week?

26:52.320 --> 26:54.440
- Um...

26:54.600 --> 26:56.280
Okay.

26:56.440 --> 27:00.160
- You didn't tell me your name.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.040
- Richard?

27:13.200 --> 27:15.480
Richard.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.080
- Are we separated?

27:22.240 --> 27:23.440
- What?

27:23.600 --> 27:26.240
- ls this a trial separation,
what we're doing?

27:26.400 --> 27:28.120
- What makes you think that?

27:28.280 --> 27:30.480
- l don't know.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.720
Our separateness.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.000
- Sweetie,
if we were separating,

27:35.160 --> 27:36.640
you'd be the first to know.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.800
- l guess.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.680
- Well, we would have
discussed it

27:40.840 --> 27:44.160
Trust me.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.480
- Okay.

27:46.640 --> 27:49.440
Whew, good.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.720
lt just moved.

27:55.880 --> 27:58.400
- Well, that's not possible.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.840
lt's been boiled to death.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.360
- Poor little Louie.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.880
- Well, don't name it, Richard.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.200
l mean, do whatever you want

28:07.360 --> 28:09.600
No, don't—
don't name your food.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.040
Here.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.080
- Oh.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.960
- There.
Okay?

28:26.920 --> 28:28.520
Hmm?

28:28.680 --> 28:30.440
There you go.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.440
Hmm?

28:32.600 --> 28:34.880
- lf only everything
in the world

28:35.040 --> 28:37.040
could be covered in butter.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.360
What a world that would be.

28:39.520 --> 28:40.920
- l guess.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.800
- What a buttery world.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.720
- He any good?

29:04.880 --> 29:05.680
- l don't know.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.400
lt's kind of wordy.

29:08.560 --> 29:11.360
- So what does
the renderer render?

29:11.520 --> 29:13.640
- l haven't gotten
to that part yet

29:13.800 --> 29:15.320
- Well, let me know.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.040
l'm sure it's something
briIIiant

29:18.920 --> 29:20.640
- What were you doing
in my gym class?

29:20.800 --> 29:21.640
- Nothing.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.320
- You think l didn't see you?

29:23.480 --> 29:25.120
- l was just there
for moral support.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.680
- l suck at volleyball.

29:26.840 --> 29:27.840
- You do not

29:28.000 --> 29:29.240
- l suck at everything.

29:30.360 --> 29:31.800
No, you don't

29:31.960 --> 29:33.960
You're fantastic
across the board.

29:34.120 --> 29:39.520
- Would you just shut up?

29:39.680 --> 29:40.480
- We never go out anymore.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.040
- Look, you got to leave, okay?

29:43.200 --> 29:46.040
l'm meeting Bryce later.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.840
- He's beneath you, you know.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.000
- Why you got to wear
so much shit?

30:07.160 --> 30:08.520
- 'Cause it's freezing in here.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.040
Run the heater.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.800
- You want to pay for the gas?

30:19.360 --> 30:21.080
- Are you done?

30:23.040 --> 30:24.040
Yeah.

30:53.360 --> 30:54.720
See you later.

31:15.040 --> 31:15.840
- Okay.

31:16.000 --> 31:16.800
- Well, just go for it

31:16.960 --> 31:19.400
- l—l—
l'm going.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.320
Okay, well, he's dead now.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.280
Why don't you go?

31:25.440 --> 31:26.840
Damn it
lt's your turn.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.160
l don't know how you do this
all day.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.600
l mean, there's so much
pressure.

31:29.760 --> 31:30.640
- Well, it's just a game.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.480
- l know.
- No one's dying here.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.440
- Go ahead.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.520
- We can play something else.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.000
- No, it's fine.
lt's—you know.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.640
- All right

31:37.800 --> 31:40.640
Let's see.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.360
That one's on my side.

31:55.520 --> 31:56.400
- Yeah.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.480
Well, that was fun.

31:57.640 --> 31:58.440
- Yes, it was.

31:58.600 --> 31:59.560
- Fun-packed weekend.

31:59.720 --> 32:02.120
- Okay, weII,
have a productive week.

32:02.280 --> 32:03.680
And l'll see you on the 15th.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.640
- Yeah.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.400
What?

32:26.560 --> 32:28.280
You're standing.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.320
Oh.

32:30.480 --> 32:34.400
Really?

32:40.000 --> 32:45.080
That's enough of that

32:45.240 --> 32:46.920
You remember when you stuck
that dime up your nose

32:47.080 --> 32:49.440
and tried to snort it
out your mouth?

32:49.600 --> 32:51.840
The cowboy outfit for your
seventh grade school picture?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.360
You remember?

32:53.520 --> 32:55.840
The horny toads,
the hunger strike?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.680
l cautioned you against
those decisions,

32:57.840 --> 32:58.880
but you didn't listen to me,

32:59.040 --> 33:00.480
which is fine,
'cause you were just a kid.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.280
But now it's grow-up time.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.840
The babysitter?

33:05.000 --> 33:05.880
Bad, Richard.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.280
Very, very bad, Richard.

33:09.440 --> 33:10.960
That chair's gonna be a problem.

33:11.120 --> 33:14.720
- Sakes alive.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.200
- "Making the monkey.

33:17.360 --> 33:21.880
"A humorous monkey is popular
in zooIogicaI gardens.

33:22.040 --> 33:25.440
"For exampIe, it is IoveIy
that you make a baby monkey

33:25.600 --> 33:30.760
"with small paper and that you
put it on a mother monkey.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.760
Fold A, top right corner."

33:44.920 --> 33:47.360
- Why origami?

33:47.520 --> 33:49.000
Why now?

33:49.160 --> 33:51.040
- l needed something to do
with my hands.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.040
- l'm having trouble telling
which is the monkey

33:53.200 --> 33:54.720
and which is the swan.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.960
- Oh, that can't be all of them.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.400
- No, no, there's a bunch more
in the truck.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.360
- Oh, great

34:09.520 --> 34:12.360
Start bringing them in.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.440
Horton r—

34:30.719 --> 34:31.760
- Richard, Richard,

34:31.920 --> 34:33.400
for the Iove of God,
don't do this please.

34:33.560 --> 34:34.360
Listen to me.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.440
You're making a huge mistake.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.800
You're going for it

34:41.560 --> 34:44.080
- lt's Abby.

34:44.239 --> 34:45.560
My name.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.920
Oh, you got rid of the couch.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.320
- Yeah, the couch was a problem.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.400
Um...

35:06.560 --> 35:08.160
This is for you.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.440
- Oh.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.920
lt's...

35:12.080 --> 35:15.120
it's a fish.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.040
A dead fish.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.920
A whole dead fish.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.000
- Yeah.

35:20.160 --> 35:23.400
My dad fishes, like,
for a living.

35:23.560 --> 35:24.360
lt's a fluke.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.160
- ln what sense?

35:26.320 --> 35:27.880
- lt's called a fluke.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.360
lt's—the water around here
is swimming with them.

35:30.520 --> 35:31.320
- Ah, yeah.

35:31.480 --> 35:32.280
So it's edible?

35:32.440 --> 35:35.720
- Yeah.

35:35.880 --> 35:36.680
- A fluke.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.440
That's great

35:38.600 --> 35:40.480
Thanks.

35:44.120 --> 35:46.520
- So l read that book you wrote.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.760
l hope that's okay.

35:48.920 --> 35:50.760
- Reading my book?

35:50.920 --> 35:51.720
Of course.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.720
You may be one of the few.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.240
- So are you going out tonight?

35:56.400 --> 35:58.160
Out on the town?

35:58.320 --> 35:59.480
- Uh, l don't know.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.480
What do the people of Montauk
do on a Friday night?

36:02.640 --> 36:04.040
- The Yardarm's totally dead.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.920
So you'd probably like that

36:07.080 --> 36:08.560
lt's down by the harbor.

36:08.720 --> 36:09.760
You can't miss it

36:09.920 --> 36:14.080
- What did you think
of the book?

36:14.240 --> 36:15.040
- l don't know.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.040
What did you think of it?

36:16.200 --> 36:17.320
- Me?
Oh, l—

36:17.480 --> 36:21.680
you know,
it's got its strengths,

36:21.840 --> 36:23.960
got its moments.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.840
l hate it

36:30.760 --> 36:33.520
- You should probably
put that fish in the fridge,

36:33.680 --> 36:35.880
'cause it'll stink up
the whole house.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.560
Trust me.
I know.

36:50.880 --> 36:51.800
What?

36:53.400 --> 36:54.200
- Soup ingredients.

36:54.360 --> 36:55.920
You know, if you feel like it

36:58.720 --> 37:00.560
- You bought me a rutabaga.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.520
- You're making this
too easy on me.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.480
- Well, like l said, you know,
if you feel like it

37:07.640 --> 37:10.680
No pressure.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.360
- Your book was cool, actually.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.680
lt kind of blew me away.

37:47.040 --> 37:50.040
- You planning on having
something to eat?

37:50.200 --> 37:51.160
- Thanks, no.

37:51.320 --> 37:54.880
homemade.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.440
- Can't beat that

37:56.600 --> 37:57.400
Another beer?

37:57.560 --> 37:59.440
- Sure.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.680
- So what brings you down
to the South Shore, then?

38:11.840 --> 38:12.640
- A book.

38:12.800 --> 38:13.840
A bird.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
A book about a bird.

38:16.160 --> 38:20.280
Research work, you know.

38:20.440 --> 38:23.280
- My wife makes
a good chowder.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.640
Not so much a clam chowder
Iike you'd expect,

38:26.800 --> 38:29.840
more of a corn chowder.

38:31.680 --> 38:35.080
- My Lorraine, she can shuck
a dozen oysters

38:35.240 --> 38:36.440
in a minute and a half.

38:36.600 --> 38:37.920
- Local Malpeque oyster?

38:38.080 --> 38:39.320
- That's the one.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.840
- My wife invented and patented
a Iifesaving poIymer shunt

38:45.040 --> 38:45.880
- Shunt, you say?

38:46.040 --> 38:47.960
- Shunt

38:57.800 --> 38:58.960
So there's our heath hen,

38:59.120 --> 39:01.000
hunkered down at Camp Hero.

39:01.160 --> 39:01.960
- Just down the road here?

39:02.120 --> 39:03.360
- Yep.
As game warden—

39:03.520 --> 39:04.320
- The Alfred guy.

39:04.480 --> 39:05.280
- Yeah, correct

39:05.440 --> 39:07.240
Alfred is his actual name.

39:07.400 --> 39:11.400
In the book, I am going
to call him Horton or Morton.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.560
Anyway, so he's brought
his flock of heath hens

39:14.720 --> 39:16.400
back from the brink
of extinction.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.600
- Awesome.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.120
- l mean, he was down to 11
of them.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.400
11, you know, but now with care,
and dare I say, Iove,

39:22.560 --> 39:23.360
and incubators,

39:23.520 --> 39:25.640
he's got 200.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.000
And it's like the hen is saved.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.280
- Safe, thank God.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.520
- But because our story
is a tragedy,

39:30.680 --> 39:31.920
you know what happens?
- What?

39:32.080 --> 39:33.200
- Fire.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.320
- No!
- Come on!

39:34.480 --> 39:35.760
- Oh, yeah,
it sweeps across the preserve.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.120
Of course, the heath hen,

39:37.280 --> 39:39.160
not nature's most intelligent
bird to begin with...

39:39.320 --> 39:40.320
- l hear ya.

39:40.480 --> 39:41.880
- She just sits in her nest

39:42.040 --> 39:43.560
You know, and she doesn't have
the sense to run

39:43.720 --> 39:45.640
or fly or waddle.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.000
You know,
when the fire runs out,

39:48.160 --> 39:50.480
there's just five birds
remaining.

39:50.640 --> 39:53.160
- Roast chicken.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.800
- What happens to the five?

39:59.040 --> 40:00.360
- They dwindle.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.040
They dwindle

40:03.200 --> 40:06.400
till there's just one left,
you know?

40:06.560 --> 40:07.560
Just one.

40:07.720 --> 40:11.560
Just one poor stupid
little thing.

40:11.720 --> 40:15.600
You know,
it's just a stupid bird.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.360
Just one.

40:23.480 --> 40:26.560
lt's a true story.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.200
- Another round
for my friend here, Mike.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.240
- Chicken shit

41:08.600 --> 41:11.000
Oh, you did make soup.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.400
Bless your heart.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.440
Oh.

41:14.600 --> 41:18.240
Mm, oh.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.760
Such a small act of kindness,

41:19.920 --> 41:23.320
but l can't tell you
what that means to me.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.280
- Well, it's no big deal.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.680
lt's just soup.

41:25.840 --> 41:30.160
- You are such a beautiful girl.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.960
You are such a beautiful child.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.120
- You're loaded.

41:34.280 --> 41:35.600
- No, no, no, l—

41:35.760 --> 41:36.560
well, yes.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.240
- Okay, l should go.

41:38.400 --> 41:39.640
Since tonight
was a little longer—

41:39.800 --> 41:41.080
- You know what l am?

41:41.240 --> 41:43.640
Let me tell you what l am,
just in case you're interested.

41:43.800 --> 41:44.960
This is what l am.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.240
- What?

41:46.400 --> 41:49.040
- l am the only child
of an only child

41:49.200 --> 41:50.400
and an only child.

41:50.560 --> 41:51.680
And you know what that means.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.440
- No cousins?

41:53.600 --> 41:56.280
- lt means l am the end
of a bloodline,

41:56.440 --> 41:58.320
the last of my kind.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.320
- Okay, well,
then have some kids.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.120
Said the babysitter.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.080
lf you only knew.

42:07.040 --> 42:07.840
- Okay.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.680
Look, it's gonna be 60 bucks.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.800
Okay, you should go to bed.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.080
- l don't blame her, the doctor.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.520
You know, she's just—
she's a human mechanic.

42:17.680 --> 42:21.280
You know, she's got her hands
inside human beings every day.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.760
They're just machines to her,
you know.

42:22.920 --> 42:25.040
They're machines that break,

42:25.200 --> 42:27.440
like rot factories.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.000
So how can you create life

42:29.160 --> 42:30.520
when you know it's gonna
end up in death?

42:30.680 --> 42:31.480
l mean, l get that

42:31.640 --> 42:35.240
l get it!

42:35.400 --> 42:36.640
l don't blame her, but—

42:36.800 --> 42:40.040
- Hey, l'm sorry.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.520
- Eh.

42:41.680 --> 42:50.280
See, she doesn't realize
that human beings are warm.

42:50.440 --> 42:51.880
You know, they need contact

42:52.040 --> 42:53.600
They need, you know—

42:53.760 --> 42:55.440
you are such a beautiful girl.

42:55.600 --> 42:56.920
You are such a beautiful child.

42:57.080 --> 42:57.880
thud!

42:58.040 --> 43:00.000
No, no!

43:00.160 --> 43:01.120
thud!

43:05.440 --> 43:06.520
- Shit

43:08.080 --> 43:11.280
- l'm gonna go.

43:19.360 --> 43:21.280
Why are men such dicks?

43:21.440 --> 43:22.880
- Beats me.

43:23.040 --> 43:24.800
- l just thought he was lonely.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.280
- We're all lonely.

43:27.440 --> 43:28.320
- l don't know.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.560
Maybe l shouldn't have hit him.

43:30.720 --> 43:33.240
- No, you definitely
should have.

43:35.200 --> 43:36.480
Okay, would you rather?

43:36.640 --> 43:38.200
- l don't want to play.

43:38.360 --> 43:41.480
- Oh, come on.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.760
Would you rather

43:47.920 --> 43:50.320
have no TV for a year

43:50.480 --> 43:53.040
or onIy be abIe
to watch The Golf Channel?

43:55.240 --> 43:56.680
- Golf Channel.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.320
- Yeah, me too.

43:58.480 --> 44:03.480
At least it's TV.

44:03.640 --> 44:04.560
Your turn.

44:07.600 --> 44:11.600
- Okay, would you rather have
no friends or no parents?

44:42.960 --> 44:44.440
- Claire?

44:44.600 --> 44:46.080
- Richard, the couch is outside.

44:46.240 --> 44:48.040
- ls it the 15th already?

44:48.200 --> 44:49.360
- Are you okay?

44:49.520 --> 44:50.320
- Yes, l am.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.280
- There's soup in the kitchen.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.440
Have you been making soup?

44:53.600 --> 44:55.480
- l'll be right back.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.160
- All right

45:05.320 --> 45:06.120
You made the soup.

45:06.280 --> 45:07.240
What babysitter?

45:07.400 --> 45:10.960
Work is going great,
and l'm still not here.

45:11.120 --> 45:11.920
Drink it up.

45:12.080 --> 45:12.880
There you go.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.880
Now get out there.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.920
- You know the funny thing
about soup?

45:22.080 --> 45:24.200
You get the ingredients
basicaIIy into the pot

45:24.360 --> 45:27.080
along with the sauce and the—
not the sauce.

45:27.240 --> 45:28.600
The juice.

45:28.760 --> 45:30.280
- You mean the broth?

45:30.440 --> 45:34.960
- Right, right, and then
it just needs some cooking.

45:36.440 --> 45:38.120
- Richard, is anything wrong?

45:38.280 --> 45:39.440
l'm not—

45:39.600 --> 45:40.720
l'm concerned.

45:40.880 --> 45:44.840
- Oh, weII, thank you
for your concern, Claire.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.640
Speaking of...
how are your patients?

45:46.800 --> 45:48.520
Are they doing well?

45:48.680 --> 45:53.240
And what are some
of their names?

45:54.640 --> 45:57.360
- You know, you've got a bruise
right here.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.360
- Oh, well, you know,
beaten down by life.

45:59.520 --> 46:02.760
You know, winds of change.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.640
Anyway, l want to do some
unIoading of boxes

46:04.800 --> 46:06.920
if you want to pitch in.

46:07.080 --> 46:10.160
Then we can grab some brunch.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.200
- Oh, no, Richard, no.

46:15.360 --> 46:16.160
Are these all—

46:16.320 --> 46:18.360
- Oh, yes.

46:18.520 --> 46:19.400
- Why?

46:19.560 --> 46:21.000
Why would you do that
to yourseIf?

46:21.160 --> 46:22.360
- Well, l just thought
as I embarked

46:22.520 --> 46:23.760
on the writing of my second—

46:23.920 --> 46:25.240
my much anticipated
second novel,

46:25.400 --> 46:27.400
that l should be reminded
of the remarkable,

46:27.560 --> 46:29.240
l mean, really
quite noteworthy failure

46:29.400 --> 46:33.240
of my first noveI to seII
any copies whatsoever.

46:33.400 --> 46:35.120
- Richard, l can't go
down this road with you.

46:35.280 --> 46:38.240
- No, no, no, it's gonna be
very motivationaI, reaIIy.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.400
- That was smooth.

46:54.560 --> 46:55.400
- Hey, l got through it

46:55.560 --> 46:56.840
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait

46:57.000 --> 46:57.960
- What?

46:58.120 --> 46:59.600
- My super senses
are telling me something.

46:59.760 --> 47:00.880
- What?
- Yes.

47:01.040 --> 47:02.800
I think the doctor
may be on to you.

47:02.960 --> 47:03.880
- Oh, hush your mouth.

47:04.040 --> 47:04.840
- Knock, knock.

47:05.000 --> 47:05.800
Who's there?

47:10.600 --> 47:11.400
- Shit

47:11.560 --> 47:13.040
What do you want?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.520
- I came to see
if you were okay,

47:16.680 --> 47:17.480
'cause your head was—

47:17.640 --> 47:18.440
- lt's fine.
I'm fine.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.200
You need to go.

47:20.360 --> 47:21.440
- What?

47:21.600 --> 47:23.080
- You need to go now.

47:23.240 --> 47:26.400
- Well, screw you too.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.240
And you were the one
who came on to me,

47:28.400 --> 47:30.160
by the way.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.000
- What?

47:32.160 --> 47:35.480
- Last night, asshole.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.760
l was gonna apologize
for hitting you,

47:37.920 --> 47:38.720
but forget it

47:38.880 --> 47:41.320
You're a creep.

47:41.480 --> 47:42.840
- Wait, Abby.

47:43.000 --> 47:48.640
- The doctor's
out of her shower, FYl.

47:48.800 --> 47:51.440
- Richard, who was that?

47:52.520 --> 47:54.960
- Girl scout

47:55.120 --> 47:56.680
- Oh, okay.

48:05.040 --> 48:08.600
- Horton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.720
Horton, Norton,

48:11.880 --> 48:14.400
Norwood.

48:14.560 --> 48:16.360
Norwood regarded his solitude
as s—

48:27.920 --> 48:29.200
- How's it coming?

48:35.280 --> 48:38.040
- Norwood regarded his solitude
as some—

48:43.840 --> 48:46.840
- Richard, what's this?

48:47.000 --> 48:47.800
- lt's a fluke.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.800
- ln what way?

48:49.960 --> 48:51.120
- The fish.
lt's called a fluke.

48:51.280 --> 48:52.960
The water around here
is swimming with them.

48:53.120 --> 48:54.520
- Oh, okay.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.040
What were you planning
on doing with it?

48:56.200 --> 48:58.160
- Do l have to have a plan?

48:58.320 --> 49:00.520
Can't l just have a fish
in the house?

49:00.680 --> 49:01.880
- Yes, fine.
l'm sorry.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.200
- l thought we could cook it
then eat it

49:04.360 --> 49:05.400
How's that?

49:05.560 --> 49:07.040
- l guess l just hadn't caught
up with the fact

49:07.200 --> 49:10.040
that you're a cook now.

49:49.600 --> 49:51.240
- Okay, stop.
Stop it

49:51.400 --> 49:52.200
You can stop.

49:52.360 --> 49:53.440
Please stop now.

49:53.600 --> 49:54.400
Stop it

49:54.560 --> 49:55.640
Stop, stop, please!

49:55.800 --> 49:57.080
Stop!

50:23.920 --> 50:25.880
- Abby.

50:30.040 --> 50:31.440
- Who the hell is that?

50:35.800 --> 50:38.040
What the hell is she doing?

50:38.200 --> 50:40.760
- l don't think l got a chance
to pay you the other night

50:40.920 --> 50:41.720
How's $60?

50:41.880 --> 50:42.680
- Keep it

50:42.840 --> 50:44.320
You don't even
have a kid, so—

50:47.400 --> 50:49.000
- l think there was kind of
a misunderstanding

50:49.160 --> 50:51.520
about some of my actions
or intentions.

50:51.680 --> 50:52.840
I'm pretty sure
l said some things.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.280
- Whatever.

50:54.440 --> 50:56.200
I'm sure you're sorry
that you said all that stuff.

50:56.360 --> 50:58.320
- l'm not sorry, actually,
about all that

50:58.480 --> 51:01.440
What l'm sorry about is that
l was so abrupt at the house.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.400
lt was just—

51:02.560 --> 51:03.360
- Your wife was there.

51:03.520 --> 51:04.520
Yeah, l figured that out

51:04.680 --> 51:05.840
- Yes, it would have been,
you know,

51:06.000 --> 51:06.800
awkward, you know?

51:06.960 --> 51:09.600
- No, actually, l don't know.

51:09.760 --> 51:13.080
- Well, Claire wouldn't really
understand our...

51:14.560 --> 51:15.640
- Our what?

51:15.800 --> 51:18.880
- Uh...

51:19.040 --> 51:20.720
our friendship.

51:26.040 --> 51:26.840
- Abby.

51:27.000 --> 51:27.800
Come on.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.160
We're out of here.

51:29.320 --> 51:33.120
- Anyway, l wanted to let
you know that l respect you.

51:33.280 --> 51:37.880
And is that Chickenshit?

51:39.480 --> 51:40.280
Yeah.

51:40.440 --> 51:41.320
- He's a good-looking guy.

51:41.480 --> 51:44.320
- Yeah, he sure thinks so.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.040
- You coming or what?

51:46.200 --> 51:48.040
We're going to Turner's house,
smoke a jay.

51:48.200 --> 51:49.000
- Yeah, just a minute.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.800
- l'm Richard.

51:50.960 --> 51:52.680
- Look, you said you wanted
to hang out more.

51:52.840 --> 51:53.760
You in or out?

51:53.920 --> 51:54.840
- lt's okay, Abby.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.360
l don't want to keep you
from your jay.

51:58.520 --> 51:59.760
- Who's your friend
with the bike?

51:59.920 --> 52:01.320
- Abby's been babysitting
for me.

52:01.480 --> 52:03.800
How's Wednesday night?

52:05.560 --> 52:06.480
- Sure.

52:07.760 --> 52:11.400
- Damn, girl, move your ass.

52:13.360 --> 52:16.840
- Sorry.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.440
- What's wrong with you?

52:37.000 --> 52:39.680
- Richard!

52:40.840 --> 52:41.960
- Hello!

52:46.480 --> 52:48.040
Don't you do it!

52:48.200 --> 52:49.440
- Richard, are you here?

52:49.600 --> 52:50.440
- Yeah, l'll be right there.

52:50.600 --> 52:52.120
- Listen to me.

52:52.280 --> 52:54.280
Hey, this won't end well.

52:59.360 --> 53:00.680
Hey, how you doing?

53:00.840 --> 53:01.640
- Come on.

53:01.800 --> 53:02.720
l want to show you something.

53:02.880 --> 53:04.480
- Great, okay.

53:10.680 --> 53:14.320
l have a problem with my hands.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.680
- What do you mean?

53:15.840 --> 53:17.280
- They won't do
what l want them to do.

53:18.960 --> 53:20.360
- What do you want them to do?

53:20.520 --> 53:21.320
- Anything.

53:21.480 --> 53:22.840
l don't know, something useful.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.480
l want them to build something
or make something.

53:26.640 --> 53:27.920
- Like what?

53:28.080 --> 53:30.920
- Even Jesus, l mean,
he was a carpenter.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.120
You know, it wasn't enough
for him to save mankind.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.200
He needed a trade.

53:34.360 --> 53:38.120
I'm a fIimsy man,
an insubstantial.

53:38.280 --> 53:41.080
- Well, compared to Jesus.

53:41.240 --> 53:44.000
- l'm a paper man.

53:44.160 --> 53:46.120
- No, you're a writer.

53:46.280 --> 53:47.800
- Yeah, that's crucial.

53:47.960 --> 53:50.800
- No, it is.

53:53.160 --> 53:54.920
Here we are.

53:56.520 --> 53:58.440
- Where?

53:58.600 --> 54:01.800
- "lt is possible
to be so at sea

54:01.960 --> 54:04.200
"when life and land have
slipped under the horizon.

54:04.360 --> 54:07.400
l quietly wish to never see
either again."

54:07.560 --> 54:08.360
- Did l write that?

54:08.520 --> 54:09.400
l wrote that

54:12.200 --> 54:13.720
- Hold this.

54:21.880 --> 54:23.080
- Abby?

54:26.760 --> 54:31.040
Abby!

54:35.360 --> 54:37.440
Come on.

54:37.600 --> 54:38.400
Abby!

54:38.560 --> 54:39.360
Abby.

54:39.520 --> 54:40.960
Abby!

54:46.600 --> 54:50.280
Jesus, what are you doing?

54:50.440 --> 54:51.680
What are you doing?

54:58.240 --> 54:59.280
- Come here.

55:03.240 --> 55:04.920
- You cannot do this.

55:05.080 --> 55:06.760
You can't do that

55:24.200 --> 55:26.800
- lt was me

55:26.960 --> 55:32.560
that dared her
to go in.

55:32.720 --> 55:36.800
lt was really cold.

55:36.960 --> 55:38.960
It was much,
much colder than today.

55:39.120 --> 55:42.920
But you know, she wasn't gonna
turn down a dare.

55:45.480 --> 55:49.440
We were like that

55:49.600 --> 55:51.240
And l had eaten 23 oysters.

55:51.400 --> 55:52.200
- Hmm.

55:52.360 --> 55:54.800
- So l don't know

55:54.960 --> 55:58.240
why she went in
in her cIothes.

55:58.400 --> 56:00.760
Um...

56:00.920 --> 56:06.080
l guess maybe we thought
it wouId be warmer.

56:06.240 --> 56:08.120
Kids.

56:12.440 --> 56:18.400
And she was laughing,

56:18.560 --> 56:23.240
and, you know, fine.

56:23.400 --> 56:28.040
And then she was...

56:28.200 --> 56:30.400
And then she was gone.

56:32.920 --> 56:39.440
Just under and gone.

56:39.600 --> 56:44.320
And l just stood there.

56:48.680 --> 56:52.160
And then a couple hours later
my mom came

56:52.320 --> 56:53.400
and found me.

56:53.560 --> 56:56.800
And l guess, you know,

56:56.960 --> 56:59.080
l was waiting for her
to swim back in.

56:59.240 --> 57:04.680
But she never did.

57:04.840 --> 57:06.720
- How old?

57:06.880 --> 57:09.000
- Same age as me.

57:09.160 --> 57:11.000
We're twins.

57:11.160 --> 57:14.040
- Oh.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.480
Oh, my God.

57:16.640 --> 57:18.800
- That was a long time ago.

57:18.960 --> 57:21.800
l like to go out there
every year

57:21.960 --> 57:24.960
and swim back to shore.

57:25.120 --> 57:28.680
You know, l like to feel
the coId.

57:28.840 --> 57:33.400
- lt must have—

57:33.560 --> 57:37.720
l don't know what to say.

57:37.880 --> 57:41.080
- So we're both only children.

57:56.800 --> 58:00.240
- That was our thing every year,

58:00.400 --> 58:03.040
and you know it

58:03.200 --> 58:09.920
And you take that guy out there
on this day.

58:10.080 --> 58:12.240
He didn't even know her.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.640
- l know.

58:13.800 --> 58:17.680
- Remember when l was the only
one that wouId taIk to you

58:17.840 --> 58:19.360
for a long time?

58:19.520 --> 58:21.920
- l know, but—

58:22.080 --> 58:23.920
- He doesn't love you.

58:24.080 --> 58:26.680
lf that's what you think,
you're wrong.

58:26.840 --> 58:28.680
- What do you want me to say?

58:28.840 --> 58:31.720
- l could so move
to California.

58:31.880 --> 58:32.920
You shouldn't just assume

58:33.080 --> 58:35.240
l'll always be around,
'cause one day

58:35.400 --> 58:37.400
maybe l won't

58:37.560 --> 58:40.000
- Stop it

58:40.160 --> 58:43.000
- ls that what you want?

58:49.800 --> 58:52.080
- l don't have much of a story,
do I?

58:52.240 --> 58:53.720
- lt's all relative, l suppose.

58:53.880 --> 58:55.720
- Exactly.

58:55.880 --> 58:57.960
Other people seem
to have had events.

58:58.120 --> 58:59.240
Things have happened to them,

58:59.400 --> 59:01.320
life-altering occurrences.

59:01.480 --> 59:03.480
- l used to do things.

59:03.640 --> 59:04.560
Remember?

59:04.720 --> 59:05.800
- This isn't about you.

59:05.960 --> 59:08.440
- Amazing things.

59:10.120 --> 59:11.320
What do you want me to say?

59:11.480 --> 59:12.480
- l don't know.

59:12.640 --> 59:13.960
- No, no, no, no.

59:14.120 --> 59:16.080
Tell me what you want me to say,
IiteraIIy,

59:16.240 --> 59:22.320
'cause, frankly, at this point,
l got nothing.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.200
- But you have touched
several lives, Richard,

59:29.360 --> 59:30.160
through your work.

59:30.320 --> 59:31.280
lt's not about your happiness

59:31.440 --> 59:33.480
but the happiness you've brought
to others.

59:43.200 --> 59:46.440
- Hey, look,
it's the fund-raiser

59:46.600 --> 59:48.360
for the children's hospital
tomorrow night.

59:48.520 --> 59:51.520
And l was thinking of donating
that bottle of wine,

59:51.680 --> 59:53.920
the '71 Château Petrus.

59:54.080 --> 59:56.160
l know we were saving it
for a special occasion,

59:56.320 --> 59:58.200
but, well,
it's for a good cause.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.480
So what do you think?

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.240
Richard, did you drink
that wine,

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.120
that $5,000 bottle of wine?

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.520
lt's not in the rack.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.080
lt was for the children.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.520
Will you call me, please?

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.720
- Come in.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.240
- Whoa.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.040
Check out the couch.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.520
- You like?

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.480
- l made it with these.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.920
- All right!

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:35.880
That's awesome.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:39.360
- Yeah, sit
sit, sit, sit, sit, sit

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.120
- Uh!

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.080
- Huh?

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.720
- lt's nice.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.480
- Oh, those—
just ideas for titIes.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.720
- For your new book?

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.040
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool, what have you got?

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.640
- Uh...

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.920
Cloudscape,

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.680
Death and Desolation,

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.640
The Daffodil.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.760
- Memoirs of an Amnesiac,

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.760
Bolero.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.120
- Bolero?

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.680
- Okay.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.960
Ad Nauseam,

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.240
Balm of Silence.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.720
No?

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.480
Old Miss Ptarmigan's
Blackberry Wine?

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.440
- Whoa.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.720
- Let's forget it

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.760
Titles are impossible.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.760
- Paper Man.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.840
- You seem a lot more
interesting than me.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.520
- l'm not

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.760
It just seems that way
because l have a dead sister.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.080
- Where you been all day?

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.200
- l don't know.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.120
- Whatever.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.640
So the party's off this weekend.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.080
Turner's mom busted him.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.360
- So what about the cove?

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.720
- lt's fucking cold out there.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.680
- Big deal.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.640
So the party's off.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.920
- What kind of party?

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.280
- What do mean
"What kind of party?"

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.880
A fucking party.
- Just nothing.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.040
Just some friends hanging out

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.440
- You could use my place.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.960
- What?

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:25.920
- Seriously?

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:26.880
- Yeah, why not?

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.600
This weekend's not so good.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.720
My wife's back.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.400
But you know,
we could do next week.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.560
Friday?

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.520
- Friday is cool.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.480
- Really?

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.000
- Yeah, l'll get a keg.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.760
- Nice!
Nice.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.960
- What else do you guys need?

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.320
Appetizers, you know,
paper plates and stuff?

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.160
- No, no, no.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.440
We're okay.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.400
We've got it covered.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.560
- Great, we're on.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.680
- Righteous.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:51.760
Thanks, man.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.360
- You didn't have to do that

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.360
- Ah, it'll be fun.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.720
- Richard!

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.480
Richard?

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.400
Richard, please.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:32.880
- Hi.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.720
When the world is in peril,

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.800
when evil surrounds you,
when dange—

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.840
Okay.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.240
- Richard, help me.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.600
- You don't like it?

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.160
- All the furniture is outside.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.280
And what the hell is this?

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.920
- You seem disappointed,
going off your body language.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.240
- You don't pick up the phone
once this week.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.640
You don't call me once.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.640
l drive all the way out here,
and there's this.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.920
Richard, say something.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.440
What's this?

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.880
- What's what?

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.440
- This.
Whose is this?

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.440
- Will you just tell her?

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.200
- Claire?

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.960
- Yes?

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.640
- Are we unhappy,

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.400
or are we just pretending
to be unhappy?

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.800
- What do you mean?

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.320
- Are we just pretending
to be unhappy

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.360
to add drama to our lives

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.560
so that we seem somehow
more substantial?

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.800
l mean, think about it

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.800
Our lives
are embarrassingly easy.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.120
We've got plenty of money.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.200
We got friends.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.280
Well, you've got friends.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.880
There are people out there

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.080
who have real problems,
you know,

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.440
real reasons to be unhappy.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.120
l mean, l could be a coal miner

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.040
dying of black lung
or something.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.280
You could be a Cincinnati
crack whore on food stamps.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.800
- What?
- l don't know.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.920
Doesn't it feel like
we're faking it,

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.600
our unhappiness?

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.520
- No.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.360
No, it's real.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.040
lt's very real.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.080
l'm going home now.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.200
l think you think
this is still charming.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.960
We're not 23 anymore.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.440
You need to pull it together.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.080
Pick up the phone this week.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.800
And bring the fucking furniture
in from the Iawn.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.160
- Norwood regarded his solitude
as something—

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.560
Norwood, Norman, Richmond?

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.440
Richmond, Richmond.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.280
- Richmond regarded his solitude
as something—

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.120
Ew!

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.080
Richmond.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.040
Hitchmond.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.360
Shmichmond.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.440
- Richmond regarded his solitude
as something...

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.960
- Unbearable!

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.880
- Richmond regarded his—

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.160
- Unbearable!

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:46.240
- Richmond regarded his solitude
as something unbearabIe.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.520
- Ptoo!

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.400
Come on.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.400
Scalpel.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.040
- No, you're starting too high.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.040
You need to go down at the base
of the chin.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.000
- Oh.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.720
And then cut up from there.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.000
Good.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.560
Careful, careful, careful.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.480
Let me help you.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.280
All right
Ready?

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.960
- Yeah.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.440
- And there.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.360
Good, good, good, good.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:54.120
Okay, would you rather
always walk backwards

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.880
or stub your toe every time
you took a step?

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.280
- Why would l want to do either?

01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.240
- lt's a game.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.480
Just pick one.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.880
- Ah!

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:06.240
- Oh, drop that in the pan.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.160
Beautiful.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.160
You are really good at this.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.640
- My wife reattached
a Ieg today.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.320
- Oh.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.840
- Maybe l should have been
a fishmonger.

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.480
lt was a pact

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.120
Me and Amy

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.200
were both supposed to go

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.680
into the water,
and she did it

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.440
And l swam back.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.560

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.640
Eight

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:38.560
l guess you're too young to know
that you can get over anything.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.960
- He's always made
poor decisions.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.400
- Same with her.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.480
- You feel helpless.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.960
How long you been with her?

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.680

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.640
You?

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.360
- Oh, Christ

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.000
That's got to be over 40 years.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.440
Second grade.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.440

He never listens.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.240
- They never do.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.480
- No.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:00.840

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:08.840
Battled monsters under the bed,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.840
confidant

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.920
These days, it's a bit of a
mystery, to tell you the truth.

You?

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.840

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.280
- Good.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.240
Great

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.480
Get out while you can.

l tell you, they open the door,

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.160
You don't want to end up
Iike me.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.200

You son of a bitch!

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.040
- Don't overreact here.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.480
- Shut up.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.240
Don't tell me how to react
- lt's not like that

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.880
- Shut up!

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.480
What is this, Richard?

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.600
What—
who is that?

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:03.960
Who the fuck is that?

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.680
- She's the babysitter.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.520
- Get out

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.520
Get out

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.200
Get out!

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.720
- Hi, Lucy.

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.680
Hi, Peter.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.680
- Hi.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.240
Claire, we'll just be—

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.120
- l didn't sleep
with the babysitter,

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.320
if that's what you're thinking.

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.440
- Oh, that's so comforting.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.920
Why do we even have
a babysitter?

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.240
- lt's just a kegger, Claire.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.320
That's all.

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.600
- Just a kegger?

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.080
And with whom exactIy
did you have a kegger?

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.560
- Just some kids
from the high school.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.000
- Richard, just stop.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.280
None of this is okay.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.360
- Okay.

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.480
- You knew we were
coming this weekend.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.920
Why are you doing this?

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.520
- l've been at a bit of a loss.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.840
- That's a bullshit answer.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.320
- l've been floundering,

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.640
and Abby has been—

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.480
- What?
Abby's been what?

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.040
- A friend.

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.160
- For God's sake.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.520
That's not a friend;
that's a child.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.440
You have friends.
- No, l don't

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.240
- Do think that was a chipmunk
that we hit?

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.520
- l think they hibernate.
- Yeah.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.280
- 'Cause you don't know how
to relate to other human beings.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.080
Yeah, you isolate yourself.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.240
- Oh, you could talk.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:11.320
- What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.760
- You can be cold, Claire.

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.720
- Let's just maybe
get out of here.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.600
Can we just get out of here?
Can we Ieave this area?

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.360
- What do you mean by that?

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:22.280
- l don't know
if it's your profession or what

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.600
But it's made you hard.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.840
- l can't—
l don't accept that

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.440
- l wanted to have a baby.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.720
- Is that what
this is all about?

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.440
- We could have had a baby,
CIaire.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.000
Why didn't we have a baby?

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.880
- Why?
Because you are a baby!

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.640
You're an infant

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.880
You still have
an imaginary friend.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.520
- l just wanted
a little warm thing,

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.520
something simple
I couId start with,

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:49.440
a single relationship with
a person that was new and pure,

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.960
where I couId be me
and they could be them,

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.640
and that was aII
that was expected.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.320
And we could build this world

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.040
where there was someone else
other than me

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.400
to think about and be about,

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:05.280
the relief of being able to give
the worId to someone eIse

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.360
and just let it be theirs,

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.200
let them have their turn,

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.280
so it doesn't end with me.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.800
- Well, that's all you.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.160
Where do l come in?

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.400
- What do you mean?

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.120
God, you're the mother.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.640
- Uh, l'm so sorry, you guys.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.200
But we're gonna go.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.400
We're just gonna go.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.280
- B&B just anywhere?

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:31.240
Anywhere.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.920
- l'm sorry.

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.400
- No, it's fine.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.120
- We're just gonna—
- Okay, l'll walk you out

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.800
- We should all go on a cruise
or something.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.360
- Okay.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.160
- Take care.

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.640
- All right, if we're gonna do
this, let's—

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.480
all right, by the way,
what is she, like, 13, 14?

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.720
Let's at Ieast get
our facts straight, though.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.840
Okay, it was you, Richard.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.360
You didn't want to have a baby.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.440
You weren't ready.

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.920
So that little fuzzy
fucking speech

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:28.600
my friends had to hear
was bullshit

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.560
And now l'm—
l can't

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.480
So l guess l'm the bad guy.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.640
- No, not the novel.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.640
Look, l'd rather you didn't—

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.600
- What is this?

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.800
What is this?

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.200
- That's it

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.800
- After all this time out here,

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.960
this is it?

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.480
This?

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.640
Maybe if you'd spent
more time working

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.600
instead of fucking
the babysitter—

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:57.920
- No.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.600
- You're useless.
- Yes.

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.560
- You're totally useless.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.040
- Yes, l am.

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:03.320
- What is wrong with you?

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:08.720
- l don't know what to do
with my hands!

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:21.040
Jen and my sister
and Liv all envied me.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.520
l had the one who made me laugh.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:24.480
What happened?

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.680
l don't know what happened.

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.800
- You stopped laughing.

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.680
- Help you?

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.480
- Yeah, l came to pay
my respects.

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.640
- Sorry?

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.480
- The heath hen,
the North American heath hen.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:39.840
This is where
the last one lived, died.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.440
- Oh.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.440
l wouldn't know anything
about a heath hen.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.360
But you're welcome
to Iook around.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.520
We've got several varieties
of pIover.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.200
- Thank you.

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:17.040
So this is what the end
of something looks like.

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.880
- The world went on, Richard.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.120
- But never the same.

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.720
Who knows how she might have
changed things

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.880
with herjust being here,
the rippIe effect

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.280
- And if that chicken
hadn't died out,

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:27.720
you'd be perfectly
well adjusted.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:28.680
- Maybe.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.960
- Doubtful.

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.920
- Instead,
l'm a childless loser.

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.520
l'm condemned to oblivion,
Captain,

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.200
just Iike our IittIe hen.

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:45.400
lt's time for you to go.

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.120
- No.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:51.640
- You know what l'm saying,
Captain.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.640
I mean,
go and never come back.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.480
- l'm not ready.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:02.720
- lt doesn't matter.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:07.640
You can't help me anymore.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.560
The doctor's right

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.200
- But you'll be all alone.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.320
- Yes.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.360
Last of my kind.

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.320
Okay.

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.920
Do the voice

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.880
one last time.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.080
Please.

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.960
- When the world is in peril,

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:49.480
when evil surrounds you,

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:52.080
when danger is lurking...

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.760
Who do you call?

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.240
- Captain Excellent

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:36.480
- I wish I had
a really amazing

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:39.640
fucked-up father like him.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.040
- Captain.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.720
Richmond regarded his solitude—

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:20.960
Merton regarded—
Horton regarded—

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:32.720
Richmond?

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.040
Richmond?

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:45.400
Richard.

01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:02.400
Richard regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.720
- l had this dream last night

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:45.120
And you were in it

01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:47.560
- Oh, was l interesting?

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:51.040
- You were you.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.120
You're leaving, aren't you?

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.800
- Yeah, you know,

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.920
'cause of the situation.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:06.880
- Yeah.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.160
l figured.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:19.400
You know,
spring is my favorite time,

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:22.080
'cause summer people
aren't here yet

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.240
lt's not so fucking cold.

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:27.960
- Yeah.

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:33.000
Um, l made you something.

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.200
- That's the swan.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:54.120
The beautiful, graceful swan.

01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:58.520
It's—
Richard, it's perfect

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.400
- Yeah, well...

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:05.160
- Thank you.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:13.200

just getting started.

as a well-earned
badge of honor,

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:43.240
a cloak to be worn
to ward off life,

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:45.960
as his safety.

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.400
Solitude is who he was.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.160
This caused those in his life

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.080
to view him
with a barely veiled contempt.

01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:55.640
Richard was certain
that he was not liked,

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.280
which is hard on a man.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.360
Maybe it was because
he gave nothing

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.600
that he received nothing
in return.

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.920
ln any case, his situation
had become intolerable.

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:07.760
The closest things
he had to friends

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:10.280
were either imaginary
or extinct.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.200
Richard had reached a point
in his life

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:16.800
where this was no longer
enough.

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.760
And then he met a girl,

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.400
and she was warm,
and she was sad,

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.160
and she was maybe lonely
in a way

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:28.080
that reminded him of himself.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.560
She'd lost things that a girl
should never have lost.

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:36.280
And she knew things,
and she taught him.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.680
And Richard thought,

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:43.920
"Maybe this is what friendship
feels like.

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:47.320
Maybe."

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:55.360
lt was just a glimpse.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.000
They'd barely begun, really.

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:05.760
But in those long
few winter days,

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.440
she'd given him so much,

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.600
enough so that Richard
could go on.

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:22.960
And what had he given her?

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:27.040
Just a few words on a page.

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:31.440
Not much, perhaps.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.240
But for Abby,
he hoped it was enough.
