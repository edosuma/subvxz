49:11.160 --> 49:12.800
MISH: Glen.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.400
Mish.

49:29.560 --> 49:32.240
I'm just gonna go and see
if my house is still there.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.640
(SIGHS)

49:40.080 --> 49:42.320
Do you want some company?
Yeah.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.920
(VOICE BREAKING)
Yeah, that would be nice.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.080
Hell of a party, young lady.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.080
(LAUGHS)

49:53.080 --> 49:54.440
Let's go, Psycho.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.240
(PSYCHO BLEATS)

49:57.360 --> 49:59.480
GLEN: (SNIFFS) God...

50:00.640 --> 50:02.040
Yeah...

50:54.400 --> 50:56.840
The animals! What are you doing?!
They're gonna die!

50:56.840 --> 50:58.840
There is no time, Zo!

50:58.840 --> 51:00.200
Aagh!

51:00.200 --> 51:02.800
Where are the trucks?
The roof is on fire!

51:02.800 --> 51:04.240
We currently have no available

51:04.240 --> 51:05.720
appliances in responding distance.

51:05.720 --> 51:06.840
We're on our own.

51:06.840 --> 51:08.920
I need a truck. I've got two people
trapped in a burning house.

51:08.920 --> 51:10.640
I can't pull trucks I don't have
out of my arse!

51:12.240 --> 51:13.680
Re-route the Queensland team.

51:13.680 --> 51:15.480
10 Blue Wren Road, West Curran.

51:15.480 --> 51:18.480
Two women sheltering. Priority.
TASH: Acknowledge priority, over.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.880
Mott, we've gotta go.
(SIREN WAILS)

51:20.880 --> 51:23.920
"It's too late to leave."
That's what you said.

51:23.920 --> 51:25.440
I'm not dying in here.

51:27.560 --> 51:30.760
Go! Go! Go!
