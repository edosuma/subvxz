00:02.503 --> 00:05.504
CLEVELAND:
Twelve, eleven, ten--

00:05.506 --> 00:06.839
hurry, Jr.!

00:06.841 --> 00:07.940

00:07.942 --> 00:10.242
(screaming)

00:12.779 --> 00:16.849
BOTH:

Happy Black History Month!

00:19.520 --> 00:21.353
(cheering, laughing)

00:21.355 --> 00:22.755
This is why you
woke us up?

00:22.757 --> 00:26.325
It took me four Budweisers
to get to sleep.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.994
You've been pre-partying?!

00:28.996 --> 00:30.896

01:31.892 --> 01:33.725
I am the greatest!

01:33.727 --> 01:34.760
Thank you, Dylan.

01:34.762 --> 01:35.828
Well, I think
it's obvious

01:35.830 --> 01:38.797
that Dylan would make
the best Muhammad Ali

01:38.799 --> 01:40.866
on our float
in the Unity Parade.

01:40.868 --> 01:44.803
(humming "Hail to the Chief")

01:44.805 --> 01:47.206
Obama's in the house, y'all!

01:47.208 --> 01:49.141
Stimulus package.

01:49.143 --> 01:49.908
Shut up, Biden.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.177
Give me a cigarette.
(chuckles)

01:52.179 --> 01:54.379
Oh, Rallo,
I'm so sorry,

01:54.381 --> 01:56.615
but I already promised
Hot Wheels

01:56.617 --> 01:58.350
he could play
President Obama.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.419
I'm more Barack
than you'll ever be,

02:00.421 --> 02:03.489
and more Michelle
than you'll ever get!

02:03.491 --> 02:04.823
Ooh, ooh!

02:04.825 --> 02:07.759
The audacity
of Hot Wheels!

02:07.761 --> 02:08.660
(mimics sizzling)

02:08.662 --> 02:10.562
In the spirit of
President Obama,

02:10.564 --> 02:12.731
I'm gonna accept
that with a calm,

02:12.733 --> 02:14.399
almost medicated
equanimity.

02:14.401 --> 02:17.002
I'll just go ahead and be one
of the other black presidents.

02:17.004 --> 02:19.938
Actually, I want to be the first
black president.

02:19.940 --> 02:20.839
Who was it?

02:20.841 --> 02:21.640
(kids giggle)

02:21.642 --> 02:23.942
Rallo, Barack
Hussein Obama

02:23.944 --> 02:26.712
is the first
black president.

02:26.714 --> 02:27.479
What?!

02:27.481 --> 02:29.781
Washington wasn't black?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.517
No.
Jefferson?

02:31.519 --> 02:32.317
No.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.352
If Rutherford B. Hayes

02:33.354 --> 02:36.522
wasn't a brother,
I don't know what's up!

02:36.524 --> 02:39.424
Well, who were all the black
people voting for back then?

02:39.426 --> 02:42.995
For a long time they weren't
allowed to vote, Rallo.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.763
They were slaves.

02:44.765 --> 02:45.697
What?!

02:45.699 --> 02:49.334
Do-Do people know about this?

02:49.669 --> 02:51.737
This is an inexcusable outrage!

02:51.739 --> 02:54.540
I want every black person
to listen up.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.908
And that means everyone.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.042
I want you to rise up

02:57.044 --> 03:00.479
and find the nearest white-owned
home or business and burn...

03:00.481 --> 03:02.781
(Muzak plays)

03:04.484 --> 03:05.350
(wrench clicking)

03:05.352 --> 03:09.621
Jr., would you like the honor
of flipping the switch?

03:10.857 --> 03:14.259
(air hissing)

03:15.895 --> 03:18.230
(Cleveland Jr. cheering)
There he is!

03:18.232 --> 03:19.431
What do you think,
Donna?

03:19.433 --> 03:22.034
I think black history
is American history

03:22.036 --> 03:24.937
and shouldn't be celebrated
just one month a year.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.805
I also think I don't
want my house

03:26.807 --> 03:28.507
looking like Lionel
Jefferson.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.508
Why didn't anybody tell me

03:29.510 --> 03:32.678
about the travesties our people
have been subjected to?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.813
Slavery. Couldn't vote.

03:34.815 --> 03:35.948
Condoleezza Rice.

03:35.950 --> 03:36.848
What else don't I know?

03:36.850 --> 03:40.319
A man plants his seed
in a woman.

03:40.321 --> 03:43.422
Man, growin' up today.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.990
Our people
are making strides.

03:44.992 --> 03:48.927
The Aunt Jemima label is
less racist than in days past.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.363
Are you kidding me?
What? I like it

03:51.365 --> 03:53.365
on my buttery pancakes.
What?!

03:53.367 --> 03:55.701
Ooh, I could go for
some pancakes.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.869
Did somebody say "pancakes"?

03:57.871 --> 03:58.904
Mmm.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.872
Man, you're a
fat sellout.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.207
What did I
expect from you?

04:02.209 --> 04:04.676
You let your stepdaughter
date a white boy,

04:04.678 --> 04:06.645
you let your son date
a white boy.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.547
(giggles)
That's impossible.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.916
Me and Ernie
are both boys!

04:10.918 --> 04:13.452
That doesn't
make any sense.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.821
(laughs)

04:15.823 --> 04:16.755
You work for a white guy.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.992
You ride around all day
in a truck with a white guy.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.827
You drink with white guys.

04:21.829 --> 04:22.928
And a bear.

04:22.930 --> 04:23.895
A black bear?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.897
His father was
a black bear.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.833
His mother, a kangaroo.

04:27.835 --> 04:28.967
So call him what
you will.

04:28.969 --> 04:33.672
Well, your boy Lester's
definitely a straight-up racist.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.641
Look at that!

04:35.643 --> 04:36.975
CLEVELAND:
The flag?

04:36.977 --> 04:38.377
Oh, he's just
expressing

04:38.379 --> 04:41.580
his rich cultural tradition
of dumbassedness.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.016
CLEVELAND JR. (laughing):
Two boys!

04:44.018 --> 04:45.317
Mrs. Lowenstein told me

04:45.319 --> 04:47.019
what that flag means.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.353
You're pathetic for being

04:48.355 --> 04:49.988
friends with him.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.056
You're worse than

04:51.058 --> 04:52.591
Uncle Thomas the Tank Engine.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.627
I reckon I'll take you where
these here tracks go, sir.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.728
Thank you, Uncle
Thomas.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.997
You're a clean,
articulate train.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.866
Just get your white ass
on board.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.100
What's that,
Thomas?

05:02.102 --> 05:04.736
Uh, uh, choo-choo!

05:07.407 --> 05:10.742
RALLO: Where you going,
sellout convention?

05:11.944 --> 05:14.880
I am going to see
my friends, Rallo.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.015
Oh, including Lester,
the racist?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.884
Why don't you ask him
what he thinks

05:18.886 --> 05:20.519
about Seal and Heidi Klum?

05:20.521 --> 05:22.287
The recording artist
who sang "Kiss from a Rose"

05:22.289 --> 05:23.789
from the <i>Batman Forever</i>
<i>soundtrack</i>

05:23.791 --> 05:25.657
and the German supermodel
I think about

05:25.659 --> 05:27.526
during self-exploration?!

05:29.629 --> 05:31.029
Black History Month!

05:31.031 --> 05:33.198
Where's our White History Month?

05:33.200 --> 05:34.866
Where's our White
Panthers?

05:34.868 --> 05:37.803
Where's the White & Decker
cordless sander?

05:37.805 --> 05:40.939
You don't have an answer
to that, do you?

05:40.941 --> 05:42.107
(grunting)

05:42.109 --> 05:45.977
Lester, how do you feel
about Seal and Heidi Klum?

05:45.979 --> 05:48.080
I'm glad you asked,
Cleveland.

05:48.082 --> 05:50.048
I don't think a man
with his skin

05:50.050 --> 05:51.616
should be with a
woman like that.

05:51.618 --> 05:55.554
When you say, "his skin,"
do you mean color or texture?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.622
I don't think I like your tone,
Cleveland.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.926
When you say, "my tone," do you
mean the tone of my voice,

06:00.928 --> 06:02.127
or the tone of my skin?

06:02.129 --> 06:04.996
I'm too drunk to fully
understand what you
just asked,

06:04.998 --> 06:06.264
but you're pissing
me off.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.400
You and that black
mustache of yours.

06:08.402 --> 06:12.137
How dare you judge me
by the color of my mustache!

06:12.139 --> 06:13.405
(grunting)

06:15.608 --> 06:17.109
(groans)

06:22.115 --> 06:23.982
(both grunting)

06:31.124 --> 06:32.657
Take this, you
honky cracker!

06:32.659 --> 06:35.994
This is for not letting us have
more offensive racial slurs

06:35.996 --> 06:38.230
than "honky" and
"cracker"!

06:38.232 --> 06:39.231
(glass shattering)

06:39.233 --> 06:42.167
(machine dinging)

06:42.169 --> 06:46.538
Someone clean up
the trash!

06:46.540 --> 06:47.672
Wait, wait, wait.

06:47.674 --> 06:50.842
Someone clean up
the white trash.

06:50.844 --> 06:54.146
Yeah, that's better.

06:57.016 --> 06:58.517
Look, I didn't want
to hit him.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.286
But I couldn't let him get away
with it, Donna.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.621
Well, all right, old man!

07:02.623 --> 07:04.990
Finally taking the fight
to whitey himself.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.192
I didn't know you had it in you.

07:07.194 --> 07:07.826
No, Rallo.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.995
I shouldn't have
resorted to violence.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.663
Violence is
never the answer.

07:11.665 --> 07:15.133
Unless the question is,
"What is never the answer?"

07:15.135 --> 07:17.602
(doorbell rings)

07:17.604 --> 07:19.104
Cleveland Brown?

07:19.106 --> 07:19.838
That's me.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.606
We are investigating
a racial incident

07:21.608 --> 07:23.308
which took place
at The Broken Stool last night.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.077
Oh, Lester didn't mean
anything by that mess.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.847
I'm afraid that's not why
we're here, Mr. Brown.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.015
According to multiple
eyewitnesses,

07:30.017 --> 07:33.552
you were seen assaulting
Mr. Lester Krinklesac.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.019
What?!

07:34.021 --> 07:35.120
Apparently you also referred

07:35.122 --> 07:36.221
to Mr. Krinklesac as a--

07:36.223 --> 07:39.858
ma'am you may want to cover
your child's ears for this--

07:39.860 --> 07:42.594
a "honky" and a "cracker."

07:42.596 --> 07:43.962
You make me sick.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.263
You're under arrest.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.232
For what?
Hate crime.

07:47.234 --> 07:47.766
(gasps)

07:47.768 --> 07:49.234
A hate cr...?! Wha...?!

07:49.236 --> 07:51.303
I'm gonna call
my lawyer.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.270
(keypad beeps)

07:52.272 --> 07:54.840
Uh, Cleveland Brown
for Len Stein.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.007
He's not?

07:56.009 --> 07:58.710
He's sitting Shivah
for his dead aunt?

07:58.712 --> 07:59.978
He'll be out for
two weeks?!

07:59.980 --> 08:03.181
You tell that bagel muncher
he's a dead man!

08:03.183 --> 08:05.150
You hear me?
A dead ma--

08:05.152 --> 08:06.251
(clears throat)

08:06.253 --> 08:07.953
I'm sorry for his loss.

08:07.955 --> 08:12.691
You watch, he's still gonna
charge me for that call.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.264
Mmm, check out my man,

08:19.266 --> 08:21.299
all smooth and sexy-lookin'

08:21.301 --> 08:24.336
like Blair Underwood goin'
to court in <i>L.A. Law.</i>

08:24.338 --> 08:27.372
Or Denzel in <i>Philadelphia,</i>
<i>but the point is,</i>

08:27.374 --> 08:30.609
how dare Lester accuse me
of a hate crime?

08:30.611 --> 08:32.277
That's like
the <i>Twilight</i> movies

08:32.279 --> 08:34.579
lining up to see
a bunch of fat girls.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.181
It's all backwards!

08:36.183 --> 08:37.716
You're a hero, old man.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.252
You wouldn't believe
how many white college kids

08:40.254 --> 08:41.686
bought these T-shirts.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.687
Let me see that?

08:42.689 --> 08:44.890
Hanes Beefy Tees? How much?

08:44.892 --> 08:46.658
$20.
All right.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.726
Give me two for 35?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.027
I want to get one
for my wife.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.729
Yeah, I'll give you two
for 35.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.230
You got a woman's large?

08:52.232 --> 08:54.132
Look, there's
Lester now.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.067
Geez, Lester.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.002
Overact much?

08:57.004 --> 08:59.304
That's verbal assault!
Verbal assault!

08:59.306 --> 09:00.672
Witness!

09:00.674 --> 09:01.206
(sighs)

09:01.208 --> 09:02.974
Hi, Ernie, you want a bite

09:02.976 --> 09:04.409
of my candy necklace?

09:04.411 --> 09:07.112
Do I?!

09:07.114 --> 09:08.313
You're coming with me.

09:08.315 --> 09:12.751
You keep your weird son
away from my weird son!

09:14.754 --> 09:16.321
So, I think you'll
find, Your Honor,

09:16.323 --> 09:17.923
that like most
hate crimes,

09:17.925 --> 09:21.693
this was nothing but a
big misunderstanding.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.928
Huh? You know what?

09:22.930 --> 09:26.898
It's such a nice day, why don't
we have court outside?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.100
He's the coolest judge.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.369
Your Excellency...

09:31.371 --> 09:32.771
Oh-oh, hang on.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.406
(sighs) I felt a drop.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.441
You feel that, Tony?
Yeah.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.943
Yeah, me, too.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.211
LESTER:
And I can't eat,

09:40.213 --> 09:41.413
I can't sleep.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.747
I live in constant fear.

09:42.749 --> 09:46.718
Plus, with my sprained finger,
I can't fiddle or whittle.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.787
I mean, this guy
messed me up bad.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.322
My teeth used
to be straight.

09:50.324 --> 09:51.756
That's an outright lie!

09:51.758 --> 09:55.927
Oh, so now all white people
are liars!

09:55.929 --> 09:57.762
No, just you!

09:57.764 --> 10:00.865
And George W. Bush.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.500
There. I said it.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.869
Do with me what you will.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.771
Order in the court!
Order in the--

10:06.773 --> 10:08.640
Oh, ah, bummer.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.175
Left my gavel outside.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.743
Nope, got it
right here.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.744
Cheers, man.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.479
Anyway, listen,
I've heard enough.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.348
So, I-I know you
dudes are all,

10:16.350 --> 10:19.484
"Okay, Judge Dave,
what is the sentence?"

10:19.486 --> 10:21.019
All right, all right,
get this.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.322
I sentence you both
to build a float--

10:24.324 --> 10:28.727
together-- for the
Stoolbend Unity Parade.

10:28.729 --> 10:29.694
What?!
What?!

10:29.696 --> 10:31.896
Classic Judge Dave.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.431
He really thinks
outside the box,

10:33.433 --> 10:35.266
like the editors of
<i>Time</i> magazine.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.269
(tank wheezing)
We could do a story
on computers.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.005
What?
Computers.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.341
(overlapping mumbling)

10:47.113 --> 10:49.280
So... uh...

10:49.282 --> 10:50.215
this is fun.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.650
The-the two musketeers!

10:51.652 --> 10:56.254
Who says we need Lester and
Cleveland to have a good time?

10:59.392 --> 11:01.359
(sighs) I wish Cleveland
and Lester

11:01.361 --> 11:03.395
would kiss and make
out already.

11:03.397 --> 11:04.963
I once tried to kiss Josh Lucas.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.164
Didn't go for it.
Punched me.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.066
Told him I was doing a bit.
Didn't believe me.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.502
Told him he was more handsome
than a young Paul Newman.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.804
Then he kissed me.
Weird night.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.039
Never doing shrooms again.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.575
Turns out it wasn't Josh Lucas.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.678
Yeah, okay.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.185
(moans)

11:27.187 --> 11:28.386
Aw, dawg!

11:28.388 --> 11:28.853
Liquid ice!

11:28.855 --> 11:32.557
What? Roberta, why can't you
just date a black guy?

11:32.559 --> 11:34.459
Do I <i>look</i> white or Asian?

11:34.461 --> 11:37.529
Yo, sis, you got to be
more like Cleveland--

11:37.531 --> 11:38.463
he's the real deal.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.199
He knows how to
stand up to The Man.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.636
By doing arts
and crafts with him?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.707
What?! People are crazy!

11:48.709 --> 11:50.942
We need some racial
justice around here!

11:50.944 --> 11:54.879
I guess if a man wants to see
any <i>real</i> change in this world,

11:54.881 --> 11:56.548
he has to take it
upon himself to...

11:56.550 --> 11:59.451
Rallo, you're
blocking the TV!

11:59.453 --> 12:01.953
TV ANNOUNCER:
In honor of Black History Month,

12:01.955 --> 12:03.922
tonight's episode
of <i>Flavor of Love</i>

12:03.924 --> 12:07.792
will be shown without
commercial interruption.

12:08.394 --> 12:13.098
I'm gonna take that flag down
by any means necessary.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.066
Our people have come too far.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.268
FLAVOR FLAV (on TV):
Yeah, boyeee...!

12:17.270 --> 12:18.536
(TV audience laughing)

12:18.538 --> 12:20.839
(groans)

12:21.807 --> 12:24.042
(van door closes)

12:27.546 --> 12:29.280
Rallo! You're
gonna miss your bus!

12:29.282 --> 12:31.616
Don't want to be late
for the Unity Parade!

12:31.618 --> 12:32.517
Yeah, yeah,
whatever.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.286
Let's get this thing over with.

12:36.822 --> 12:39.891
Look, Cleveland, let's
just get through this,

12:39.893 --> 12:42.327
and we never have to talk
to each other again.

12:42.329 --> 12:46.364
Fine. Soon I will only
stare down at you eerily

12:46.366 --> 12:49.167
from my attic window.

13:02.014 --> 13:04.282
(door creaks)

13:14.426 --> 13:15.927
(high-pitched gasping)

13:15.929 --> 13:18.129
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!

13:18.131 --> 13:19.631
Timber...!

13:19.633 --> 13:21.166
(screaming)

13:22.501 --> 13:24.269
Oh, my Lord...

13:24.271 --> 13:28.473
I think I crushed
another dog.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.543
KENDRA:
Help...!

13:33.479 --> 13:36.281
Help! Somebody help!

13:36.283 --> 13:38.983
Dang, you're a lot of lady.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.518
Is that you, Jesus?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.587
No! It's me, Rallo!

13:42.589 --> 13:44.689
(grunting in fear)

13:44.691 --> 13:46.624
Don't rob us!

13:46.626 --> 13:48.426
We ain't got no cash!

13:48.428 --> 13:50.028
That bagel muncher Len Stein

13:50.030 --> 13:54.032
got us all tied up
in mortgage-backed securities!

13:54.034 --> 13:55.266
What?! I'm not a thief!

13:55.268 --> 13:57.669
I'm just here
to steal your flag.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.070
Now, get off me!

13:59.072 --> 14:02.140
(strained grunting)

14:02.142 --> 14:04.008
I can't move!

14:04.010 --> 14:05.043
(grunts)

14:05.045 --> 14:08.012
My Rascal is my legs.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.981
And my arms.

14:09.983 --> 14:13.017
And, too often, my toilet.

14:13.019 --> 14:13.351
(groans)

14:13.353 --> 14:16.454
(squeaky chittering)

14:16.456 --> 14:18.056
Oh, Princess!

14:18.058 --> 14:19.023
Thank God!

14:19.025 --> 14:21.359
Bring Mama the phone.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.994
(squeaky chittering)

14:22.996 --> 14:25.597
<i>El telefono.</i>

14:25.599 --> 14:27.932
Bring it to Mama.

14:29.335 --> 14:30.702
Stupid possum.

14:30.704 --> 14:31.636
(squeaks)

14:31.638 --> 14:35.540
(squeaking)
Aah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

14:37.977 --> 14:43.481
Welcome, minorities, to
the 2010 Stoolbend Unity Parade.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.383
The parade has been
a Stoolbend tradition

14:45.385 --> 14:48.319
since Virginia became
the last state in the nation

14:48.321 --> 14:52.624
to officially abolish slavery
earlier this year.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.561
Hey, Gilbert Grape's mom.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.528
Yeah?

14:57.530 --> 14:58.963
I'm hungry.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.098
Me, too.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.433
If you was on
death row,

15:02.435 --> 15:04.469
what would your
last meal be?

15:04.471 --> 15:07.772
Oh, what, I'm gonna end up
on death row because I'm black?

15:07.774 --> 15:12.844
No. I said it because my peepaw
was on death row,

15:12.846 --> 15:17.181
and his last meal was
77 mozzarella sticks.

15:17.183 --> 15:20.184
He never made
it to the chair.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.686
Massive coronary.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.155
(laughs)
But that was peepaw!

15:24.157 --> 15:25.523
Popcorn shrimp.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.291
What, now?

15:26.293 --> 15:29.427
That'd be my last meal--
popcorn shrimp.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.430
(laughs) I love
popcorn scrimps!

15:32.432 --> 15:34.766
Getting hard to find
these days, though.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.535
Yeah, if they close down
one more Red Lobster,

15:37.537 --> 15:38.803
I'm gonna have
to kill somebody.

15:38.805 --> 15:42.273
And then <i>you'd</i> end
up on death row.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.541
Like your peepaw.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.209
And then you
could order...

15:45.211 --> 15:47.445
popcorn scrimps!
Popcorn shrimp!

15:47.447 --> 15:50.148
(both laughing)

15:51.650 --> 15:54.085
I got to say,
Mrs. Krinklesac,

15:54.087 --> 15:55.153
I misjudged you.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.222
You may be a backwoods
redneck cracker,

15:58.224 --> 15:59.490
but you're all right.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.458
Oh, Rallo,

16:00.460 --> 16:04.028
I take back what I
said about Katrina.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.563
Uh-huh.
(beeping)

16:05.565 --> 16:06.531
RALLO:
What's that?

16:06.533 --> 16:10.234
Oh, no!
It's my diabetes buzzer!

16:10.236 --> 16:13.504
I need sugar,
or I'll go into a coma

16:13.506 --> 16:15.540
and you'll be crushed!

16:15.542 --> 16:16.507
What do you mean?

16:16.509 --> 16:17.608
I've been
arching my back

16:17.610 --> 16:20.311
to keep some of
my weight off you.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.681
But I'm starting
to get weary.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.717
(cracking)

16:25.719 --> 16:26.617
Oh, no!

16:26.619 --> 16:29.654
I hope they just say
I died under a woman

16:29.656 --> 16:31.856
and leave it at that.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.993
And here we have our
third court-ordered float,

16:34.995 --> 16:35.827
"Working Together,"

16:35.829 --> 16:38.062
featuring the duo
behind Stoolbend's

16:38.064 --> 16:39.630
most recent hate crime,

16:39.632 --> 16:41.799
Cleveland Brown
and Lester Krinklesac.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.668
GORDY: And look who they've
got on the float.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.571
It's Robert Parish
and Larry Bird.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.905
ANGUS:
Flashing back to the '90s,

16:47.907 --> 16:52.110
there's Dave Matthews
and his weird violinist guy.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.746
GORDY:
And Madonna and Barbaro.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.347
Just another
quarter-mile

16:56.349 --> 16:59.851
and I don't have to be
tolerant ever again.

17:02.755 --> 17:03.855
(crowd gasping)

17:03.857 --> 17:06.424
The Chief!
You're burning the Chief!

17:06.426 --> 17:08.092
You did that on purpose!

17:08.094 --> 17:09.594
(grunts)
You bastard!

17:09.596 --> 17:12.296
Without that mustache,
he's hideous!

17:13.198 --> 17:14.932
Mrs. Tubbs?

17:14.934 --> 17:16.334
What are you doing here?

17:16.336 --> 17:18.136
I thought Rallo
was missing school

17:18.138 --> 17:21.372
to tend to your bad
sore throat, which
makes you sound

17:21.374 --> 17:23.274
exactly like Rallo
on the phone.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.877
What?! Rallo never
came to school today?

17:25.879 --> 17:28.513
Where is he?
(grunts)

17:34.653 --> 17:35.753
(tires squeal)

17:37.189 --> 17:38.756
Don't worry, Rallo.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.125
Mama's on her way.

17:43.529 --> 17:46.531
(tires squeal)

17:53.472 --> 17:55.740
(tires squeal)

17:59.978 --> 18:01.646
As a mother,
this is not even

18:01.648 --> 18:04.715
the most stressful thing
I've done today.

18:07.719 --> 18:12.623
Oh! The darkness
is closing in.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.226
I'm comin', Peepaw!

18:15.228 --> 18:17.995
I'm comin', Dale, Sr.!

18:17.997 --> 18:20.698
No. Don't you die
on me, Mrs. K!

18:20.700 --> 18:24.969
Stay with me and I'll make sure
we get that popcorn shrimp.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.105
With side orders?

18:27.107 --> 18:29.240
You bet.
Cheese biscuits,

18:29.242 --> 18:31.342
onion rings, hush puppies...

18:31.344 --> 18:33.444
Oh, hush puppies!

18:33.446 --> 18:36.280
You're getting me
all hot and juicy.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.917
What?!
You're making me sweat!

18:40.419 --> 18:42.620
Oh, man,
you're not kidding.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.821
Wait a minute!

18:43.823 --> 18:45.089
If you keep
sweating like this,

18:45.091 --> 18:47.024
I can probably
slide myself out.

18:47.026 --> 18:50.328
Well, then keep naming sides.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.330
Uh, macaroni
and cheese,

18:52.332 --> 18:54.732
bread, baked potatoes...

18:54.734 --> 18:56.200
Describe them!

18:56.202 --> 18:58.236
They're huge and fluffy

18:58.238 --> 19:01.305
and covered in butter
and cheese...

19:01.307 --> 19:02.206
Oh, yeah!

19:02.208 --> 19:03.608
And bacon bits

19:03.610 --> 19:05.843
and sour cream
and ice cream

19:05.845 --> 19:07.912
and Pop-Tarts
and Fun Dip.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.647
Are you close?
Yes!

19:09.649 --> 19:10.481
Faster!

19:10.483 --> 19:12.083
Cocoa Puffs.
Lucky Charms.

19:12.085 --> 19:15.186
Marshmallows.
Maple syrup.
(Kendra moaning)

19:15.188 --> 19:16.654
Peppermints. Beef.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.989
Uh, cookie dough, uh...

19:17.991 --> 19:19.056
jar of lard.
(moaning continues)

19:19.058 --> 19:21.659
Cheez-Its. Funyuns.
What do they call those

19:21.661 --> 19:23.694
fried jalapeño cheese things?

19:23.696 --> 19:25.796
Poppers!

19:25.798 --> 19:27.532
(Rallo grunts)

19:28.400 --> 19:30.535
(Kendra sighing)

19:33.972 --> 19:36.107
(Cleveland and Lester scream)

19:36.109 --> 19:37.308
(paramedics grunting)

19:37.310 --> 19:39.677
Oh, my God!
Rallo!

19:39.679 --> 19:40.611
Kendra!

19:40.613 --> 19:43.114
What did you do to her,
you little rascal?

19:43.116 --> 19:44.982
Which one of the
Little Rascals?

19:44.984 --> 19:46.517
I think you know.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.186
Lester, stop!

19:48.188 --> 19:50.288
He saved my life.
He what?

19:50.290 --> 19:53.691
If it wasn't for Rallo,
I'd be dead.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.294
But thanks to him,
the doctor says

19:56.296 --> 19:58.196
I'm gonna be perfectly fine.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.364
I definitely
did <i>not</i> say that.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.366
Your wife has severe
type-2 diabetes

20:02.368 --> 20:05.269
and cholesterol that
cannot be measured

20:05.271 --> 20:06.404
by current science.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.407
Your boy saved my Kendra.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.441
You know, uh,

20:10.443 --> 20:13.110
maybe you're not
so bad after all.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.845
I accept your apology.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.113
I didn't apologize.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.316
You don't have to.
And neither do I.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.350
It's just who we are.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.385
I'm probably gonna
keep saying dumb crap,

20:21.387 --> 20:23.454
'cause I don't know
any better.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.823
And I'll be here
to fly off the handle

20:25.825 --> 20:28.359
and slap you around
when you do.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.460
Friends again?

20:29.462 --> 20:31.963
Course we are.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.299
Oh, and it would
mean a lot to Rallo

20:35.301 --> 20:37.435
if you took down
that Confederate flag.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.503
Confederate flag?
What's that?

20:39.505 --> 20:41.939
That there's
my <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i> flag

20:41.941 --> 20:43.741
signed by Roscoe P. Coltrane
hisself.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.445
You don't know what
the Confederate flag
stands for, do you?

20:47.447 --> 20:48.246
Nope.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.348
Do you know what
"KKK" stands for?

20:50.350 --> 20:53.084
Kendra Krystal
Krinklesac.
Huh?!

20:53.086 --> 20:57.255
Maybe they <i>should</i> have
a White History Month.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.389
(all laughing)

20:58.391 --> 21:04.095
Stay tuned for an all-new,
all-white <i>Family Guy.</i>
