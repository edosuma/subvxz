ALL I CAN SAY.

03:51.267 --> 03:52.633
SHE WAS WITH MY MOTHER.

-DO YOU KNOW THIS
INDIVIDUAL RIGHT HERE?

03:54.233 --> 03:55.900
DO YOU KNOW THIS HOUSE?
-I DO. THAT'S WHY
I CAME OVER HERE.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.800
-THAT'S WHY YOU CAME OVER HERE?
-SO THEY CAN CALL MY MOM

03:57.900 --> 03:59.400

04:10.733 --> 04:13.267
-DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
CHARGES YOU STACKED UP BECAUSE--
-MEAN, I'M-- I'M...

04:13.367 --> 04:15.067
I WAS IN A DECENT
PLACE, OFFICERS.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.633
-OKAY.

04:21.733 --> 04:23.333
I REALLY...
'CAUSE THAT WAS--

04:23.433 --> 04:25.433
IT WAS DANGEROUS
AND I MEAN, I'M--
-IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.200
-I'M-- I'M SCARED.
I'M A GOOD DRIVER,
BUT I'M SCARED.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.333
I'M GLAD I JUST
DIDN'T TEAR A CAR UP
AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF.

04:31.433 --> 04:33.600
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN
TO TAKE YOU ALL
THROUGH ALL THIS.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.067
I APOLOGIZE.
I TRULY DO.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.567
-WHAT'S YOUR FIRST NAME, BOSS?
-ANGELO.

04:36.667 --> 04:37.767
-GOT AN I.D.
OR SOMETHING ON YOU?

04:37.867 --> 04:40.333
-IT'S IN ONE OF THESE--
NO, IT'S IN THE CONSOLE.

04:40.433 --> 04:42.867
-DO YOU KNOW ANGELO?
-YEAH, HE'S MY COUSIN.

04:42.967 --> 04:45.733
-ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHY
HE WAS RUNNING TODAY?

04:45.833 --> 04:47.567
-I HAVE NO IDEA. I'M...

04:47.667 --> 04:49.700
TO MY RECOLLECTION,
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE AT A JOB.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.533
-BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED
WAS WE WERE DOING

04:51.633 --> 04:53.733
A SAFETY CHECKPOINT,
HE DID AN ILLEGAL U-TURN,

04:53.833 --> 04:55.967
TOOK OFF ON US,
I TRIED TO PULL HIM OVER

04:56.067 --> 04:58.600
FOR THE ILLEGAL U-TURN,
TOOK OFF AT A HIGH
RATE OF SPEED.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.467
THIS WAS OFF
OF MONTICELLO ROAD.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.167
WE WENT ALL
THROUGH THE COUNTY.

05:02.267 --> 05:05.167
CAME BACK DOWN
OFF OF FOREST DRIVE
BACK UP THIS WAY.

05:05.267 --> 05:08.533
-YEAH, I SAW THE CHASE
ON FOREST DRIVE, SO...
-YEAH, THAT WAS HIM RIGHT THERE.

05:08.633 --> 05:10.333
AND HE PUT A LOT
OF LIVES IN DANGER.

05:10.433 --> 05:11.700
LUCKILY, NOBODY WAS HURT.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.133
THERE'S NO ACCIDENTS.

05:13.233 --> 05:14.667
-THAT'S A GOOD THING.
-IT IS.

05:14.767 --> 05:15.833
YOU WANT TO TALK TO HIM?

05:15.933 --> 05:17.733
-YEAH, I WOULDN'T MIND.
-OKAY.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.300
HEY, ANGELO,
SO YOU WANT TO

05:21.400 --> 05:22.933
TELL HIM WHAT
HAPPENED TONIGHT?

05:23.067 --> 05:24.867
-MAN, HE KNOW
I DON'T HAVE A LICENSE.

05:24.967 --> 05:27.700
HE KNOWS. I MEAN,
HE ALREADY KNOWS.
-BUT--

05:27.800 --> 05:30.600
-FINE-- FINE ON TOP OF FINES
AND BILLS TO PAY

05:30.700 --> 05:32.233
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
HE KNOWS.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.967
-HOW MANY KIDS
DO YOU HAVE?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.367
-IF I DON'T
TALK TO ANYBODY,

05:35.467 --> 05:37.167
THIS IS THE ONE GUY I TALK TO.
THAT'S WHY I CAME OVER HERE

05:37.267 --> 05:39.133
INSTEAD OF GOING ANYWHERE ELSE.
-HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE?

05:39.233 --> 05:40.600
-GOT THREE KIDS.
-THREE KIDS?

05:40.700 --> 05:41.967
-YES, SIR.
-DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY CHILDREN

05:42.067 --> 05:43.900
YOU MIGHT HAVE PUT
INTO DANGER TONIGHT?
-I REALIZE.

05:44.067 --> 05:45.500
-YOU GOTTA TAKE
A DEEP BREATH AND JUST STOP,

05:45.600 --> 05:47.100
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
A WHOLE LOT SAFER

05:47.200 --> 05:49.933
FOR EVERYBODY
AND EVEN FOR YOU.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.400
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
-I KNOW, MAN.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.300
SOMETIMES I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA BE WRAPPED
AROUND A TREE.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.900
I JUST AIN'T WANNA
TEAR THAT CAR APART, MAN.

05:55.067 --> 05:58.067
-BUT YOU KNOW,
THERE'S MORE THINGS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN A CAR,

05:58.167 --> 06:00.933
MORE THINGS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN
EVADING THE POLICE.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.600
YOU GOTTA THINK ABOUT,
LIKE HE SAID,

06:02.700 --> 06:05.433
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES,
YOUR LIFE.
-THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THAT, MAN.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.900
-THINK ABOUT--
-THAT'S WHY I SLOWED DOWN
AND CAME OVER HERE.

06:08.067 --> 06:10.400
-IF YOU HAD WRECKED,
KILLED YOURSELF,

06:10.500 --> 06:13.300
THE KIDS ARE WOULDN'T HAVE
NOBODY TO DEPEND ON THEM.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.900
YOU GOTTA THINK LIKE THAT.
YOU GOTTA LET THOSE THOUGHTS
COME THROUGH YOUR MIND

06:17.067 --> 06:19.300
BEFORE YOU MAKE--
-MAN, YOU KNOW
I KNOW THIS ALREADY.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.567
-THEY'RE TRAINED TO REACT
TO THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS

06:22.667 --> 06:25.167
AND PICTURE THE WORST
SCENARIO, YOU KNOW?

06:25.267 --> 06:26.767
SO, I MEAN,
IT'S A BLESSING THAT

06:26.867 --> 06:28.867
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
GOOD OFFICERS WHO CAN,

06:28.967 --> 06:31.400
YOU KNOW, APPREHENDED YOU
IN A WAY THAT, WELL...

06:31.500 --> 06:33.700
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WELL.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.200
THE COMMUNITY
IS WELL, YOU KNOW?

06:36.300 --> 06:37.933
JUST SOMETHING
TO THINK ABOUT.

06:38.067 --> 06:40.667
-ALL RIGHT, ANGELO,
SO WHAT'D YOU LEARN TONIGHT?

06:41.767 --> 06:44.500
-I MEAN, IT'S-- I GUESS IF I'M
IN THIS SITUATION AGAIN,

06:44.600 --> 06:47.133
THE BEST THING
I CAN DO IS JUST PULL OVER.

06:47.233 --> 06:48.333
-JUST PULL OVER.

06:48.433 --> 06:49.800
THIS ENDED
THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY

06:49.900 --> 06:51.167
THIS COULD'VE ENDED TONIGHT.

06:51.267 --> 06:52.567
-I WAS SPEEDING.
OF COURSE--

06:52.667 --> 06:54.367
-JUST BE THANKFUL
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT...
-I AM.

06:54.467 --> 06:57.067
-...YOU'RE STILL
GONNA SEE YOUR KIDS.
-I MEAN, I AM. I AM. I TRULY AM.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.667
-ALL RIGHT.
-HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW,
I COME HOME TOMORROW

06:59.767 --> 07:02.900
AND APOLOGIZE TO THEM
FOR BEING AWAY FOR THE NIGHT.
-OKAY.

07:03.067 --> 07:05.067
DIDN'T GIVE US ANY PROBLEMS
WHEN HE GOT OUT THE CAR.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.667
HE'S BEEN VERY
COOPERATIVE AND RESPECTFUL

07:06.767 --> 07:07.933
THE ENTIRE TIME SINCE THEN.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.067
I DON'T THINK
HE'S A BAD GUY.

07:09.133 --> 07:10.767
HE JUST MADE
A BAD DECISION TONIGHT

07:10.867 --> 07:12.233
AND NOW HE'S GONNA
HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.067
-Officer Hill:
SO I KIND OF FELL
INTO THIS JOB.

07:17.133 --> 07:19.433
I WAS DOING A COUPLE
OF PART-TIME JOBS

07:19.533 --> 07:22.700
AFTER I HAD LEFT TEACHING,
AND AN OPPORTUNITY

07:22.800 --> 07:25.067
BECAME AVAILABLE,
AND I TESTED

07:25.133 --> 07:27.500
FOR, AT THE TIME,
MERIDIAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

07:27.600 --> 07:29.867
AND I GOT HIRED ON
WITH MERIDIAN POLICE DEPARTMENT.

07:29.967 --> 07:32.633
I WAS WORKING FOR THEM
FOR APPROXIMATELY 18 MONTHS

07:32.733 --> 07:34.733
BEFORE I CAME OVER
TO BOISE POLICE.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.467
SO I SAW THIS VEHICLE
AT THE GAS STATION.

07:39.567 --> 07:41.233
A COUPLE OF
SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING SUBJECTS.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.067
THEY WERE ALL PRETENDING
TO PUMP GAS.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.600
EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION,

07:44.700 --> 07:45.767
SO THEY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.667
I CIRCLED BACK AROUND
AND THEN THEY DIDN'T

07:47.767 --> 07:51.167
USE THEIR TURN SIGNAL,
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE
CONTACT WITH THE DRIVER.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.367
-Officer: HOW MANY?
-Officer Hill: THREE.

07:58.467 --> 08:00.067
-YOU WANT TO CALL HER OUT?

08:00.133 --> 08:02.633
JUST TALK TO HER BACK HERE?
-YEAH, WE CAN.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.467
THERE'S TWO OTHER
OCCUPANTS IN THE VEHICLE.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.533
-LET'S GET AN I.D.

08:05.633 --> 08:07.067
-Officer Hill: DRIVER?
-Woman: YEAH?

08:07.133 --> 08:08.500
GO AHEAD AND STEP
OUT OF THE VEHICLE.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.067
KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.300
STEP BACK TOWARDS ME.
-BACKWARDS?

08:13.400 --> 08:14.733
-NO, YOU CAN JUST COME--
COME OVER HERE.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.133
WE'RE JUST GONNA
TALK TO YOU.

08:16.233 --> 08:18.600
GO AHEAD AND JUST
HANG OUT HERE FOR ME, OKAY?

08:18.700 --> 08:20.867
-WHAT HAPPENED?
-IS THAT YOUR VEHICLE, MA'AM?

08:20.967 --> 08:22.300
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.133
JUST HAVE A SEAT RIGHT HERE
ON THE EDGE OF MY BUMPER, OKAY?

08:24.233 --> 08:26.533
ALL RIGHT,
IS THAT YOUR VEHICLE?

08:26.633 --> 08:28.467
-YEAH.
-HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD IT?

08:28.567 --> 08:32.867
-THAT'S MY SECOND TEMPORARY,
SO... GOING ON TWO MONTHS?

08:32.967 --> 08:34.533
-TWO MONTHS? OKAY.
-OVER A MONTH, UNDER TWO.

08:34.633 --> 08:36.533
-DO YOU HAVE INSURANCE
ON THAT VEHICLE RIGHT NOW?
-NO. NONE.

08:36.633 --> 08:38.767
-OKAY. SO THE REASON
I STOPPED YOU IS THAT

08:38.867 --> 08:41.100
YOU FAILED TO MAKE--
TO USE YOUR TURN SIGNAL

08:41.200 --> 08:43.600
TO MAKE YOUR LEFT
TO GET ONTO GROVER, OKAY?

08:43.700 --> 08:45.500
YOU USED YOUR TURN SIGNAL
COMING OUT OF THE GAS STATION,

08:45.600 --> 08:46.867
YOU DID NOT USE
YOUR TURN SIGNAL

08:46.967 --> 08:48.100
FROM CURTIS
ONTO GROVER,

08:48.200 --> 08:49.533
SO THAT'S WHY
I STOPPED YOU, OKAY?

08:49.633 --> 08:51.567
-I THINK I DID,
BUT IT'S-- IT'S REALLY--
IT CLICKS REALLY FAST

08:51.667 --> 08:53.833
'CAUSE IT'S GOING OUT,
UNLESS THAT MEANS
IT'S COMPLETELY OUT.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.367
-I THINK IT'S
COMPLETELY OUT, SO...

08:55.467 --> 08:57.333
HAVE YOU HAD ANY PROBLEMS
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BEFORE?

08:57.433 --> 08:59.300
-NO. NO RECORD AS AN ADULT.
-OKAY.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.767
-I'VE BEEN ON PROBATION ONCE.
WHEN I WAS 16.
-OKAY.

09:01.867 --> 09:03.767
-BUT I'M OFF EVERYTHING.
-OKAY. AND WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

09:03.867 --> 09:06.533
-PARAPHERNALIA. WEED.
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

09:06.633 --> 09:10.067
-IS THERE ANY OF THOSE ITEMS
IN THE VEHICLE? CONTRABAND?
-NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:10.167 --> 09:11.900
-PARAPHERNALIA
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
-NOPE, NOPE, NOPE.

09:12.067 --> 09:14.300
I HAVE NOT DONE THAT
SINCE I WAS A KID.
-M'KAY.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.433
SO WHERE ARE
YOU HEADED RIGHT NOW?

09:15.533 --> 09:16.933
'CAUSE THIS IS--
-I'M GOING TO DROP THEM OFF.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.133
-OKAY.
-I NEED TO GET RID OF THEM.

09:18.233 --> 09:19.700
I GOTTA WORK
AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.333
CAN I ASK WHY
IS ALL THIS IS GOING ON?

09:21.433 --> 09:23.633
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE ANTICIPATING SOMETHING.

09:23.733 --> 09:26.067
I JUST DON'T--
-WELL, YOUR ACTIONS
WERE FAIRLY EVASIVE

09:26.100 --> 09:27.867
WHEN YOU WERE COMING
OUT OF THE GAS STATION

09:27.967 --> 09:29.133
AND THEN MAKING YOUR TURN.

09:29.233 --> 09:32.767
ALL THAT CONCERNS ME
BECAUSE PRETTY CLEARLY TO ME,

09:32.867 --> 09:35.700
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU WERE TRYING
TO DRIVE TO GET AWAY FROM ME.
-I DON'T HAVE INSURANCE.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.400
-OKAY.
-AND I JUST DON'T--
I DON'T NEED THE TICKET.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.400
LIKE, I DON'T NEED
THIS RIGHT NOW.
-BUT THAT-- THAT'S NOT

09:39.500 --> 09:40.833
A BIG DEAL, AND THAT'S
NOT WORTH, LIKE...

09:40.933 --> 09:42.500
TRYING TO SPEED
AWAY FROM THE POLICE.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.833
GET PROBABLE FOR THAT.
-RIGHT, BUT I'M--

09:43.933 --> 09:45.167
I'M WILLING TO GIVE
YOU GUYS I.D.'s.

09:45.267 --> 09:46.467
LIKE, I HAVE NOTHING GOING ON.
-OKAY.

09:46.567 --> 09:48.300
-I JUST-- I NEED TO WORK
AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING.
-OKAY.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.500
-YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO LEAVE
BY WHAT TIME? MAYBE 5:00.
-OKAY.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.833
-I DON'T NEED THIS
RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
USE A TURN SIGNAL.

09:52.933 --> 09:54.433
LIKE, COME ON.
-M'KAY. M'KAY.

09:54.533 --> 09:56.300
-LIKE... COME ON.
-ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT--

09:56.400 --> 09:58.400
-THERE'S MORE IMPORTANT WORK
THAT'S PROBABLY GOING
ON RIGHT NOW.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.067
IT'S A FRIDAY NIGHT
AND YOU'RE PULLING ME OVER.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.067
I'M TRYING TO TAKE
THESE KIDS HOME.
-BUT, ALYSSA, DO I KNOW YOU?

10:02.167 --> 10:03.333
HAVE I EVER HAD
CONTACT WITH YOU?
-NO.

10:03.433 --> 10:05.667
-SO THERE ARE THINGS
THAT WE DO FOR OUR SAFETY.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.633
OKAY?
-IS SOMEONE TALKING
TO THEM ALREADY?

10:07.733 --> 10:10.133
CAN WE JUST-- I JUST WANT
TO GET THIS, LIKE--
-Sgt. Mitchell: JUST A SECOND.

10:10.233 --> 10:12.167
YOU GOT-- YOU GOT TO
GET GOING PLACES, YEAH?

10:12.267 --> 10:14.200
SO CHILL, ALL RIGHT?

10:14.300 --> 10:16.933
-YEAH, THE SOONER--
-THE DOG'S GONNA
WORK THE CAR, ALL RIGHT?

10:17.033 --> 10:18.433
-THE SOONER THAT
WE GET THROUGH THIS,

10:18.533 --> 10:20.033
THE SOONER THAT
WE WRAP EVERYTHING UP

10:20.133 --> 10:21.733
AND THE SOONER YOU CAN
CARRY ON WITH YOUR NIGHT

10:21.833 --> 10:24.033
AND TAKE YOUR FRIENDS HOME
OR DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO.

10:24.133 --> 10:25.567
OKAY?

10:25.667 --> 10:28.467
-Man:
WE'RE GONNA DROP OFF
MY GIRLFRIEND IN GARDEN CITY.

10:28.567 --> 10:30.400
-AND SHE'S GONNA TAKE
YOU GUYS TO NAMPA?
IS THAT THE DEAL?

10:30.500 --> 10:31.667
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

10:31.767 --> 10:33.500
HEY, BUD, KEEP YOUR HANDS
OUT OF YOUR POCKETS.
-YEP.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.233
-(indistinct)

10:37.900 --> 10:39.800
SO YOU GUYS JUST CHILL, OKAY?

10:39.900 --> 10:42.033
DOG'S GONNA BE DONE
WITH THE CAR IN JUST
A SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

10:42.133 --> 10:43.367
-ALL RIGHT.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.933
-WELL, SHE'S HITTING ON
WHAT LOOKS LIKE
THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

10:50.033 --> 10:52.200
AND SHE'S SNIFFING
ALL OVER THAT,

10:52.300 --> 10:54.300
BUT SHE DIDN'T GIVE ANY...

10:54.400 --> 10:56.300
FINAL RESPONSE THERE.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.000
THE ONLY THING
SHE'S HITTING ON LOOKS LIKE

10:58.100 --> 11:00.500
MAYBE AN ADIDAS BACKPACK
THAT'S ON THE FLOORBOARD

11:00.600 --> 11:03.200
RIGHT BY WHERE HER FEET
WOULD BE TUCKED UP
UNDER THE SEAT, SO...

11:03.300 --> 11:05.067
-WHERE THE DRIVER'S
SEAT WORK--

11:05.133 --> 11:06.300
-RIGHT. YEAH.
-OKAY.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.733
OKAY, SO RIGHT NOW,
WE'VE HAD A DOG DO

11:09.833 --> 11:12.200
AN OPEN AIR ALERT
FOR POSSIBLE NARCOTICS,

11:12.300 --> 11:15.367
SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK AND SEE
IF WE CAN FIND ANY NARCOTICS

11:15.467 --> 11:17.067
OR PARAPHERNALIA
IN THE CAR.

11:17.133 --> 11:19.267
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

11:19.367 --> 11:22.267
OH, THAT'S METH.
LOOK AT THAT.

11:22.367 --> 11:24.067
-CAME OUT OF THAT.
IT WAS IN HERE.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.467
-SO IT LOOKS LIKE
WE POSSIBLY HAVE SOME NARCOTICS.

11:26.567 --> 11:28.267
SO THIS LITTLE
PLASTIC BAG HERE,

11:28.367 --> 11:29.767
IT'S ALL BURNT UP
ON THE END,

11:29.867 --> 11:32.567
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT,
IT'S GOT THE CRYSTALS IN THERE.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.667
THAT'S REALLY TYPICAL
OF METHAMPHETAMINE.

11:35.667 --> 11:39.133
THAT CAME IN
THIS MARLBORO SMOOTH.

11:39.233 --> 11:42.100
SHE'S ALREADY ADMITTED THAT
ALL THE SMOKES ARE HERS, SO...

11:42.200 --> 11:44.333
THAT'S ONE THING I'VE GOT.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.133
THIS IS IN HER BACKPACK.

11:46.233 --> 11:48.567
TYPICALLY, CASES
LIKE THIS WE'LL HAVE

11:48.667 --> 11:50.800
SOME KIND OF THING
THAT WILL BE ASSOCIATED

11:50.900 --> 11:53.233
WITH THE NARCOTICS
LOCATED IN THE VEHICLE.

11:54.333 --> 11:56.100
THERE WE GO.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.400
IT LOOKS LIKE A KIT
WITH HER SMOKING DEVICE.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.267
SHE'S GOT A BROKEN DOWN STRAW,
A BATTERY...

12:02.367 --> 12:04.333
OH, WE GOT A GLASS PIPE.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.067
-WHAT THE HELL?
WHY CAN'T I JUST--

12:06.100 --> 12:08.400
I KNOW YOU CAN LET ME.
WHY WON'T YOU JUST
LET ME SMOKE A CIGARETTE?

12:08.500 --> 12:10.967
-BECAUSE I WANT TO FINISH
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT BUSINESS
AT HAND FIRST, OKAY?

12:11.067 --> 12:13.133
-I'VE BEEN SO COOPERATIVE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I CAN'T--
-OKAY.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.733
ALYSSA, INSIDE ONE
OF THOSE CIGARETTE CONTAINERS

12:15.833 --> 12:17.800
WAS WHAT APPEARS
TO BE METHAMPHETAMINE.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.167
-NO, THE (bleep) THERE WASN'T.
THERE WAS TWO PACKS
OF CIGARETTES.

12:20.267 --> 12:22.167
ONE OF THEM IS ALMOST
BRAND NEW, RIGHT?
-RIGHT.

12:22.267 --> 12:24.800
-WITH, LIKE, ONE CIGARETTE
MISSING, POSSIBLY, OUT OF 100.
-MAYBE. YEAH.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.200
-THE OTHER ONE HAD
ONE CIGARETTE IN IT,
IF I WAS CORRECT.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.333
AND THAT'S ALL
THE HELL THERE WAS.
-OKAY.

12:29.433 --> 12:31.067
-IN THAT CENTER THINGY
THAT FOLDS UP.
-RIGHT.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.633
-RIGHT? YEAH.
-THAT FOLDS UP. YEAH.

12:32.733 --> 12:35.133
NOPE, THERE WAS
NO CIGARETTE IN THERE.
-THERE WAS. THAT'S BULL (bleep).

12:35.233 --> 12:38.067
THAT'S BULL (bleep).
-AND THERE WAS A BAG
OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE-- WELL--

12:38.167 --> 12:40.900
ALYSSA, I'M JUST TELLING YOU
THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND, OKAY?
-THAT'S BULL (bleep).

12:41.067 --> 12:42.700
THERE WAS-- THAT'S BULL (bleep).
-ONE MORE THING.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.933
THEY FOUND THIS CASE.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.600
AND INSIDE THE-- THE...

12:46.700 --> 12:49.667
PSEUDO CAMERA CASE
IS A METH PIPE.

12:49.767 --> 12:51.500
A USED METH PIPE.

12:51.600 --> 12:55.600
ALSO, LIKE,
CUT DOWN STRAWS,
OBVIOUSLY USED...

12:55.700 --> 12:59.233
A LITTLE BATTERY THAT'S
OBVIOUSLY BEING USED
AS A PART OF THAT.

12:59.333 --> 13:02.067
CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT, ALYSSA?

13:02.167 --> 13:03.467
-NO, I CAN'T,
-OKAY.

13:03.567 --> 13:05.067
BUT THAT'S ALL
INSIDE YOUR BACKPACK.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.300
-I UNDERSTAND THAT.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.267
I WAS NOT IN MY CAR, THOUGH.

13:08.367 --> 13:10.100
-OKAY, BUT YOU WERE
IN YOUR CAR.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.067
THIS IS YOUR BACKPACK.
IT WAS AT YOUR FEET.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.200
-YES, I'M SAYING
THAT'S MY BACKPACK.
YES, IT'S MY (bleep) BACKPACK.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.900
-OKAY.
-CAN I JUST SMOKE A CIGARETTE?

13:16.067 --> 13:17.467
-OKAY.

13:17.567 --> 13:20.867
-I NEED TO GO TO WORK
AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING.
-ALYSSA... ALYSSA.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.433
YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT THESE ITEMS,

13:22.533 --> 13:23.800
UNLESS SOMEBODY
CLAIMS THEM IS--

13:23.900 --> 13:25.733
-THEY'RE NOT GONNA CLAIM THEM.
(bleep) CHARGE ME WITH IT.

13:25.833 --> 13:28.200
I DON'T GIVE A (bleep).
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
(bleep) CLAIM IT.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.133
-OKAY. OKAY. YOUR BACKPACK,
YOUR STUFF, YOUR CAR.

13:30.233 --> 13:33.100
TONIGHT THE CHARGES ARE
POSSESSION OF METHAMPHETAMINE

13:33.200 --> 13:34.700
AND DRUG PARAPHERNALIA.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.967
-Deputy Bubley:
I DIDN'T ALWAYS WANT
TO BE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.967
COMING FROM THE MARINE CORPS
WITH A MILITARY BACKGROUND,

13:43.067 --> 13:45.967
IT WAS A FLUID TRANSITION
TO THIS NEW CAREER PATH.

13:46.067 --> 13:49.633
THIS JOB UNFORTUNATELY
DEALS WITH PEOPLE
ON THEIR WORST DAY.

13:49.733 --> 13:53.133
BUT IT'S JUST IMPORTANT
TO STAY PROFESSIONAL
AND ALWAYS RESPECT THEM.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.100
WE'RE EN ROUTE
TO A DISTURBANCE.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.933
A MALE AND FEMALE ARE
IN A PHYSICAL ALTERCATION.

13:59.067 --> 14:00.833
SUPPOSEDLY THERE'S SOMETHING
TO DO WITH A FRYING PAN

14:00.933 --> 14:02.167
AND SOMEONE GOT HIT,

14:02.267 --> 14:03.700
SO WE'RE RIGHT
AROUND THE CORNER.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.633
WE'LL BE ONE OF
THE FIRST ON THE SCENE.

14:14.267 --> 14:15.667
-(barking)

14:15.767 --> 14:18.100
-ARE YOU IN THE ARGUMENT?
-YES, OFFICER.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.300
-DO YOU WANNA COME
TALK TO ME?
-NO.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.767
-WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:21.867 --> 14:23.667
-(indistinct)
-(barking)

14:23.767 --> 14:25.833
-SHE TURNED AROUND
AND HIT ME WITH A FRYING PAN.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.367
I'M JUST-- I'M JUST
DEFENDING MYSELF.
-SHE HIT YOU WITH A FRYING PAN?

14:28.467 --> 14:29.933
-SHE'S OVER THERE
TELLING A BUNCH OF (bleep).

14:30.067 --> 14:31.600
-HOW DID IT START?
HOW'D THE ARGUMENT START?

14:31.700 --> 14:33.900
-SHE'S BEEN BITCHING, RAVING
ALL DAY LONG TODAY.

14:34.067 --> 14:36.767
-DID YOU-- IS SHE YOUR WIFE,
OR GIRLFRIEND, OR WHAT?
-NO, SHE'S NOT MY WIFE.

14:36.867 --> 14:38.467
-SHE HIT YOU
WITH A FRYING PAN
AND THEN YOU HIT HER?

14:38.567 --> 14:40.400
WHERE DID YOU HIT HER AT?
-UPSIDE THE HEAD.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.733
-UP-- LIKE, BACK OF THE HEAD,
FRONT OF THE HEAD, FACE? WHERE?
-FACE.

14:42.833 --> 14:45.267
-OKAY. CAN YOU JUST
COME ON THIS SIDE
OF THE FENCE, BUDDY?

14:45.367 --> 14:46.800
YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE
RIGHT NOW. I'M TRYING---

14:46.900 --> 14:48.533
I'M GONNA--
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
EVERYBODY'S PARTS,

14:48.633 --> 14:50.533
BUT I DON'T WANT THE ANTS
AND I DON'T WANT
THE DOG INVOLVED,

14:50.633 --> 14:53.067
SO I WANT YOU
ON THIS SIDE, ALL RIGHT?

14:53.133 --> 14:54.467
JUST COME OVER HERE.

14:54.567 --> 14:55.533
OKAY.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.700
LET ME TALK TO
YOUR GIRLFRIEND REAL QUICK

14:57.800 --> 14:59.133
AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.067
YOU STAY IN CONTROL OF HIM.

15:01.167 --> 15:04.700
HEY, GO TALK TO HIM AND SEE
IF HE'S GOT THE SAME STORY

15:04.800 --> 15:06.067
THAT'S LINED UP WITH HER.
-SURE.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.567
-THEN WE'LL SWITCH.
WE'LL TAG TEAM OUT.

15:07.667 --> 15:09.533
HEY, MA'AM, I KNOW
YOU JUST TALKED TO MY PARTNER.

15:09.633 --> 15:11.333
CAN I JUST GET A MINUTE
OF YOUR TIME FOR A SECOND?

15:11.433 --> 15:13.567
I KNOW YOU'RE SHAKEN UP,
AND IF YOU COULD JUST
TELL ME YOUR SIDE.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.833
I KNOW YOU ALREADY
TALKED TO MY PARTNER,
BUT I NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU

15:15.933 --> 15:18.967
TO SEE IF THEY--
IF THESE STORIES ALIGN.
-I WAS GONNA START SUPPER

15:19.067 --> 15:20.733
AND WE WERE GONNA
GRILL SUPPER TONIGHT,

15:20.833 --> 15:22.567
AND HE WOULDN'T GO
OUT THERE AND LIGHT THE GRILL.

15:22.667 --> 15:25.700
AND BOUT 40 MINUTES LATER,
I SAID, "WELL, I'M JUST GONNA
COOK HOTDOGS IN A PAN,"

15:25.800 --> 15:28.800
AND THAT'S IT.
I WENT OVER THERE
AND STARTED.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.367
I PUT THEM IN THE PAN,
YOU KNOW, AND THEN TURNED

15:31.467 --> 15:35.133
THE STOVE ON AND STUFF,
AND HE CAME OVER THERE
AND HE GOT MAD AT ME,

15:35.233 --> 15:36.933
AND HE'S CUSSING AND SCREAMING
AND HE SHOVED ME.

15:37.067 --> 15:39.767
AND I SHOVED HIM
BACK OFF OF ME

15:39.867 --> 15:41.833
'CAUSE HE SHOVED ME
INTO THE COUNTER...
-YEAH.

15:41.933 --> 15:44.233
-AND MY SIDE HIT THE COUNTER.
-YEAH.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.767
-I SHOVED HIM BACK
AND HE GRABBED THIS WRIST

15:46.867 --> 15:49.733
AND HE TWISTED THE WRIST
AND STUFF AROUND...
-TWISTED YOUR WRIST?

15:49.833 --> 15:50.967
-YES.
-OKAY.

15:51.067 --> 15:54.233
-AND I TOLD HER I'VE BEEN
HAVING-- GOING TO THERAPY

15:54.333 --> 15:57.067
ON IT AND STUFF BECAUSE
I GOT SHOCKED REAL BAD,

15:57.167 --> 15:59.200
AND THEN I HAD
BROKE IT BEFORE THAT

15:59.300 --> 16:01.067
AND I CAN HARDLY USE IT.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.167
-OH, YOU HAD A PREVIOUS
INJURY TO YOUR WRIST
AND YOU TWISTED IT?

16:03.267 --> 16:04.267
-YES. TWO OF THEM, YES.

16:04.367 --> 16:05.800
-SO BASICALLY,
IF I'M GETTING THIS RIGHT,

16:05.900 --> 16:07.500
TELL ME IF I'M RIGHT
OR WRONG WITH THIS, ALL RIGHT?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.867
SO YOU GUYS HAVE KIND OF
BEEN ARGUING ON AND OFF ALL DAY,

16:09.967 --> 16:12.133
-MM-HMM.
-YOU'RE STARTING TO GET READY
FOR DINNER, FOR SUPPER,

16:12.233 --> 16:14.733
YOU WANT HIM
TO TURN THE GRILL ON.
HE DOESN'T WANNA DO IT.

16:14.833 --> 16:16.333
-NO.
-YOU SAY, "FINE, I'LL JUST
DO IT IN THE PAN.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.067
I'LL COOK THE HOTDOGS
IN THE PAN."
-YEAH. UH-HUH.

16:18.167 --> 16:20.333
-THAT TURNED INTO
EVEN MORE OF AN ARGUMENT...
-UH-HUH.

16:20.433 --> 16:22.667
-WHICH THEN YOU GUYS
GOT IN EACH OTHER'S FACE

16:22.767 --> 16:24.200
AND THEN YOU WENT
TO PUSH HIM BACK,

16:24.300 --> 16:25.467
AND THEN HE PUSHED YOU BACK...

16:25.567 --> 16:26.900
-YEAH, AND HE--
-AND THEN YOU HIT HIM
WITH THE PAN?

16:27.067 --> 16:29.500
-HE TOOK ME--
HE HIT ME IN THE NECK UP HERE

16:29.600 --> 16:31.900
WITH HIS FIST UP IN HERE
AND THEN UP HERE ON TOP

16:32.067 --> 16:33.600
OF THE SIDE
OF THE HEAD.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.333
-AND IS IT PRETTY COMMON
FOR YOU GUYS TO ARGUE LIKE THIS?

16:36.433 --> 16:38.367
-WE ARGUE, BUT NOT LIKE THIS.
-YEAH.

16:38.467 --> 16:40.267
-HE DOESN'T GET
PHYSICAL LIKE THIS.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.900
HE DOESN'T BEAT ME UP.
-YEAH.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.967
ARE YOU FEELING A LITTLE BETTER
NOW THAT WE'RE HERE AT LEAST?

16:44.067 --> 16:45.900
-YEAH.
-DO YOU FEEL SAFE
AND EVERYTHING?

16:46.067 --> 16:49.133
I'M GONNA TALK
TO MY PARTNER AND SEE
HOW WE'RE GONNA HANDLE THIS.

16:49.233 --> 16:50.800
HER STORY SEEMS MORE LEGIT.

16:50.900 --> 16:53.433
LIKE, SHE WANTED THE GRILL
ON FOR THE HOTDOGS,

16:53.533 --> 16:55.767
DIDN'T TURN THE GRILL ON,
SO SHE SAYS,
"I'LL PUT THE PAN ON."

16:55.867 --> 16:57.333
GOES TO PUT IN
ON THE PAN,

16:57.433 --> 16:59.633
HE'S GETTING IN HER FACE,
HE GRABS HER WRIST

16:59.733 --> 17:01.333
'CAUSE SHE'S NOT
LISTENING TO HIM OR WHATEVER,

17:01.433 --> 17:03.967
WHEN SHE GRAB--
WHEN THE WRIST GETS GRABBED,

17:04.067 --> 17:06.233
SHE TRIES TO PUSH HIM OFF,
HE CLOCKS HER IN THE FACE

17:06.333 --> 17:08.133
A COUPLE OF TIMES,
A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT MARKS,

17:08.233 --> 17:09.267
SWELLING AND STUFF...

17:09.367 --> 17:12.167
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN
SHE GRABS THE PAN,

17:12.267 --> 17:14.933
SO HERS IS MORE SELF-DEFENSE.
-IS THAT WHAT HE SAID TO YOU?

17:15.067 --> 17:16.567
-YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
HE'S SAYING THAT--

17:16.667 --> 17:17.733
DID YOU GET THAT, TOO?

17:17.833 --> 17:19.200
-NO. HE TOLD ME
HE DIDN'T TOUCH HER

17:19.300 --> 17:20.567
UNTIL SHE HIT HIM
WITH THE PAN.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.333
-HE DID SAY THAT THEY WERE
IN EACH OTHER'S FACE PRETTY BAD.

17:22.433 --> 17:24.567
SO SHE COULD'VE
FELT INTIMIDATED.
I MEAN, HE OUTWEIGHS HER

17:24.667 --> 17:26.933
AND HE'S MORE MASCULINE.
-HE SAID THEY'VE
BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY, TOO.

17:27.067 --> 17:29.667
THEY'VE BEEN IN
EACH OTHER'S FACES ALL DAY.
THEY'VE BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY.

17:29.767 --> 17:30.833
-OVER A BARBECUE.
OVER A BARBECUE.

17:30.933 --> 17:32.133
-WELL, THAT WAS
THE LAST STRAW.

17:32.233 --> 17:34.067
-IT'S OVER HOW TO
COOK THE HOTDOGS.

17:34.133 --> 17:36.333
BARBECUE OR PAN SEARED?
-YEAH, BUT THE BARBECUE
WAS THE LAST STRAW.

17:36.433 --> 17:38.233
-UNREAL. NOW IT'S A FELONY.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.133
ALL RIGHT, I'M THINKING
PRIMARY AGGRESSOR IS MALE HALF.

17:41.233 --> 17:43.133
WHERE ARE YOU AT WITH THAT?
-SHE'S MORE DETAILED.

17:43.233 --> 17:44.967
-YEAH.
-HE WON'T GIVE
ME ANYTHING, SO...

17:45.067 --> 17:47.167
-YEAH, I AGREE.
HE'S CONTRADICTED HIMSELF
TWO OR THREE TIMES,

17:47.267 --> 17:49.533
JUST KIND OF BEING MORE VAGUE.
SHE'S SHAKEN UP
AND I BELIEVE IT,

17:49.633 --> 17:50.933
SO I THINK
HE'S GOTTA GO.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.933
HEY, MISTER,
COME HERE FOR A SEC.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

17:53.067 --> 17:54.600
-(mumbling)
-THAT'S FINE.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.433
CAN YOU JUST TURN
AROUND FOR ME REAL QUICK?

17:56.533 --> 17:58.133
-WHY?
-TURN AROUND FOR ME REAL QUICK.

17:58.233 --> 18:00.200
I'M GONNA--
I WANNA TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR WRISTS REAL QUICK.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.767
TURN AROUND REAL QUICK.

18:01.867 --> 18:03.467
-Deputy Marshall:
TURN AROUND. YOU'RE BEING
PLACED UNDER ARREST

18:03.567 --> 18:05.067
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
BATTERY, ALL RIGHT?

18:05.100 --> 18:07.200
-LYING BASTARDS.
-NOBODY'S LYING TO YOU.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.933
YOU'RE BEING PLACED
UNDER ARREST.
-YES, YOU DID.

18:09.067 --> 18:10.900
HE TOLD ME HE WANTED
TO FEEL MY WRISTS.
YOU LYING SON OF A--

18:11.067 --> 18:12.767
-I'M THE ONE PUTTING
HANDCUFFS ON YOU.

18:12.867 --> 18:14.133
-YOU TOO.

18:14.233 --> 18:16.100
-NOBODY LIED TO YOU.
-YES, YOU DID.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.067
-WE'VE BEEN NOTHING
BUT NICE TO YOU.

18:18.167 --> 18:21.133
-ONE SECOND, MA'AM. WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TALK TO YOU SOME MORE
A LITTLE BIT, ALL RIGHT?

18:21.233 --> 18:23.133
-IT'S SIMPLE BATTERY, BUT SHE IS
OVER 65 YEARS OF AGE, OKAY?

18:23.233 --> 18:25.200
SO IT IS GONNA BE A FELONY.
-WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

18:25.300 --> 18:27.133
I'M DISABLED AND SHE'S
GONNA BEAT ME AROUND.
-I UNDERSTAND.

18:27.233 --> 18:30.500
-THAT OUGHT TO BE A FELONY.
-SHE WAS ABLE TO ARTICULATE
THE DEFENSIVE PORTION OF IT.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.433
YOU WEREN'T.
-LOOK, IT'S JUST A CHARGE
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

18:33.533 --> 18:35.433
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR DAY IN COURT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:35.533 --> 18:37.400
-COME ON, WE'RE GONNA
GO BACK TO THE SECOND VEHICLE...

18:37.500 --> 18:39.100
-AT LEAST FOR TONIGHT
YOU GUYS ARE SEPARATED, OKAY?

18:39.200 --> 18:40.867
AND THAT'S THE BEST THING
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN FOR US.

18:40.967 --> 18:43.633
-I'M DISABLED.
-I UNDERSTAND.

18:43.733 --> 18:45.333
-JUST LIKE THAT?

18:45.433 --> 18:46.933
-YEAH, THAT'S PERFECT.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.333
AND I'LL CRANK
THE AIR FOR YOU, ALL RIGHT?

18:48.433 --> 18:49.800
AND WE'LL GET YOU
DOWN TO THE JAIL

18:49.900 --> 18:51.133
SO WE CAN GET YOU OUT OF...
-(mumbles)

18:51.233 --> 18:52.867
-...THE CAR.
THE FASTER, THE BETTER.

18:55.067 --> 18:58.167
-WHY ARE YOU WITH A GUY
THAT HAS THIS TYPE OF ANGER...

18:58.267 --> 19:00.633
YOU KNOW,
LACK OF ANGER CONTROL

19:00.733 --> 19:04.533
AND ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUES?
-IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS
IT'S GOT REALLY BAD.

19:04.633 --> 19:06.133
-YOU DEFINITELY DON'T NEED
ANY MEDICAL ATTENTION

19:06.233 --> 19:08.200
FOR YOUR WRIST, OR YOUR FACE,
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
-I'M FINE.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.767
I GOTTA GO
TO THERAPY TOMORROW.

19:09.867 --> 19:12.100
-OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO THERAPY ANYWAY TOMORROW
FOR THAT? OKAY.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.600
WELL, YOU EXPLAIN
TO THEM KIND OF THAT
YOU RE-AGGRAVATED IT.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.867
THAT'S FINE.
THE BIGGEST THING RIGHT NOW
IS YOU'RE SAFE TONIGHT.

19:16.967 --> 19:18.367
HE'S GONNA GO
TO JAIL TONIGHT.

19:18.467 --> 19:22.233
UNFORTUNATELY, 'CAUSE YOUR AGE,
IT'S GONNA BE A FELONY OFFENSE.

19:22.333 --> 19:25.200
WHAT HAPPENS IS HE'S
AUTOMATICALLY GONNA SEE
A JUDGE IN THE MORNING

19:25.300 --> 19:27.200
AND THEY'RE GONNA
PLACE A NO CONTACT ORDER.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.600
WHAT THAT'S BASICALLY
GONNA SAY IS

19:28.700 --> 19:30.700
A JUDGE MANDATING
THAT HE CAN'T COME BACK TO YOU.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.700
UNFORTUNATELY, I SEE
A LOT OF THESE ARGUMENTS

19:33.800 --> 19:36.133
THAT TURN PHYSICAL BETWEEN
BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND
OR HUSBAND AND WIFE,

19:36.233 --> 19:37.767
SO YOU SHOULD REALLY
TAKE THIS OR HEED THIS

19:37.867 --> 19:40.867
AS A WARNING OF, LIKE, "HEY,
I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE."
-I AM.

19:40.967 --> 19:41.967
YOU GOT TOO MUCH
GOING FOR YOU.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.333
YOU SEEM LIKE
A REALLY NICE LADY.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.533
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
MIXED UP IN ALL THIS DRAMA,

19:45.633 --> 19:48.167
ESPECIALLY PHYSICAL DRAMA
LIKE THIS, OKAY?

19:50.467 --> 19:51.500
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.167
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:53.267 --> 19:54.933
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:55.067 --> 19:55.967
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:56.067 --> 19:59.067
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.833 --> 20:07.767
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:07.867 --> 20:09.367
-(theme music playing)
