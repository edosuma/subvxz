00:10.011 --> 00:13.306
<i>NARRATOR".
Outside the Gotham City National Bank...</i>

00:13.515 --> 00:20.313
<i>...wealthy young socialite Miranda Fleece
is about to perform an act of charity.</i>

00:20.522 --> 00:24.526
Begging your pardon, ma'am, if you don't mind
hearing a tale of some real bad luck.

00:24.734 --> 00:30.031
I know how it goes, poopsie, say no more.
Have a hundred.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.575
Heaven bless you.

00:45.004 --> 00:48.174
Help, police, fuzz!

00:49.801 --> 00:55.723
Amazing.
A veritable deluge of counterfeit bills.

00:55.932 --> 01:00.728
Being passed not by criminals
but by well-known pillars of society.

01:00.937 --> 01:02.855
It baffles me completely.

01:03.022 --> 01:08.027
Uh, there's something funny about these
counterfeits, commissioner, have you noticed?

01:08.236 --> 01:11.114
They're blank on one side
and completely genuine on the other.

01:11.322 --> 01:12.657
Exactly.

01:12.865 --> 01:16.661
It's almost as if some deranged mind
were trying to taunt our very sanity.

01:20.665 --> 01:23.793
Begorra, that laughter.

01:24.002 --> 01:29.716
- Where does it come from?
-Nowhere, and yet everywhere.

01:29.924 --> 01:33.970
Commissioner, I have a terrible feeling
we've heard this laughter before.

01:34.178 --> 01:37.682
So true, Chief O'Hara, so true,
it all fits perfectly.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.726
Joker.

01:44.731 --> 01:49.986
Once again we take our poor cracked pitcher
to the Caped Crusader's well.

01:54.032 --> 01:57.785
Gosh, economics is sure a dull subject.

01:57.994 --> 02:00.371
Oh, you must be jesting, Dick.

02:00.580 --> 02:05.627
Economics dull, the glamour,
the romance of commerce...

02:05.835 --> 02:08.503
...it's the very life blood
of our country's society.

02:08.713 --> 02:12.550
Frankly, I can think of nothing more stimulating
than economics and commerce--

02:12.759 --> 02:13.968
Yes, Alfred.

02:14.177 --> 02:18.306
Begging your pardon, sir.
It's the telephone in the study, sir.

02:18.514 --> 02:22.810
Come on, Dick, this may lead us
to a more practical lesson in loss and gain.

02:23.019 --> 02:25.563
I'm with you. So long, Aunt Harriet.

02:25.772 --> 02:29.609
Mercy alive,
the way that boy changes his mind.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.278
I wonder if he's over-tired.

02:32.487 --> 02:33.696
Yes, commissioner?

02:33.905 --> 02:37.742
Words are superfluous, Batman, uh, listen.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.413
Holy funny bone, The Joker.

02:42.622 --> 02:47.543
Courage, commissioner, courage.
Joker seldom has the last laugh.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.545
To the Batpoles.

04:15.298 --> 04:18.134
Saint's preserve us, there it goes again.

04:18.341 --> 04:23.306
- Diabolical, I'm being driven out of my senses.
-Precisely the fiend's intention, commissioner.

04:23.514 --> 04:28.227
Batman's right. Joker knows we'll need every
ounce of our sanity to outwit his filthy plot.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.980
- Hand me the Bat-Detector, Robin.
-Roger.

04:31.189 --> 04:34.567
I'll turn it in for super laugh track sensitivity.

04:34.776 --> 04:38.112
- Extend your left arm, commissioner.
-Pardon?

04:38.279 --> 04:40.448
Do as I say, commissioner,
extend your left arm.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.533
Oh, yeah, sure.

04:50.541 --> 04:56.923
Ingenuous, this criminal mirth issues
from a tiny, super-powered loud speaker...

04:57.131 --> 05:00.510
...built into your left cuff link.

05:00.718 --> 05:03.763
- Great Scott.
-Exhibit A.

05:03.971 --> 05:08.976
- How the devil did it get there, Batman?
-Joker is a master conjurer, Chief O'Hara.

05:09.185 --> 05:12.188
No doubt he brushed
against the commissioner in a crowd...

05:12.396 --> 05:16.943
...and easily affected the substitution.
Stand up, commissioner.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.278
Oh, yeah, sure. Ahem.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.204
Aha.

05:28.955 --> 05:31.374
Just as I suspected...

05:31.582 --> 05:37.839
...the agile crook also managed to slip
an induction receiving antenna...

05:38.047 --> 05:43.803
...into your left trouser leg.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.513
Exhibit B.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.765
Yes, now I remember.

05:47.932 --> 05:51.936
Some oddly costumed fellow did bump
into me in the subway this morning.

05:52.103 --> 05:55.690
Holy chutzpah. Planting criminal radio
gear on the police commissioner.

05:55.898 --> 06:01.153
No time for emotion, old churn,
let's apply our brain power to Joker's plot.

06:02.697 --> 06:05.408
This was passed by an innocent dupe?

06:05.616 --> 06:09.704
What's more, the woman had just received
that bill from the Gotham City National Bank.

06:09.912 --> 06:14.083
Gosh, Batman, if we could just puzzle out
how funny money is handed out by a bank.

06:14.292 --> 06:17.545
Good thinking, Robin.
Time for us to go fishing, if you ask me.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.047
- Fishing?
-But where, Batman?

06:20.256 --> 06:25.344
Where the fishing is always best,
commissioner, from a shady bank.

06:26.929 --> 06:30.850
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile,
a strange scene unfolds atop this building...</i>

06:31.058 --> 06:35.813
<i>...which houses Penthouse Publishers,
formerly innocent purveyors of mirth...</i>

06:36.022 --> 06:40.526
<i>...now the secret headquarters of The Joker.</i>

06:40.735 --> 06:45.239
Oh, this continued mirth is exhausting,
even for the Clown Prince of Crime.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.199
Figure he finally found the gizmo?

06:47.408 --> 06:51.495
That dunderhead Gordon, he couldn't
find a haystack in a needle factory.

06:51.704 --> 06:54.749
No, you can be quite certain,
sweet Josie Miller...

06:54.957 --> 06:59.295
...the failure of our tiny receiver
means Batman is on the job.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.964
Gee, I'm not very glad to hear that, Joker.

07:02.173 --> 07:06.260
My foolish, trepidatious child,
he's not headed here.

07:06.469 --> 07:13.184
Why even as we speak, you can bet
he's racing to the bank and doom. Ha, ha.

07:13.434 --> 07:17.271
Mr. Yock, Mr. Boff, warm-up time.

07:25.863 --> 07:29.367
Those sure are nifty robots, Joker.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.577
Comically lifelike, aren't they?

07:31.786 --> 07:36.874
They were my manual training project
last spell I did in that filthy penitentiary.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.169
Do you think they're strong enough
to hold Batman and Robin?

07:40.378 --> 07:43.547
Observe. Mr. Yock, Mr. Boff...

07:43.756 --> 07:47.885
...practice alert, bats on the premises.

07:48.094 --> 07:49.845
There on the table.

07:51.931 --> 07:55.059
Smash them, bash them, crash them.

08:01.607 --> 08:06.529
Ha, ha! Exterminate them utterly
into primordial batstuff.

08:12.326 --> 08:16.330
Robots, as you were. At ease.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.376
- What's that Joker?
-The signal from the bank.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.879
Oh. Those blundering bipeds,
they've swallowed our bait.

08:24.088 --> 08:25.965
Quick, let's watch! Quickly!

08:27.216 --> 08:29.176
Watch, my sweet.

08:32.054 --> 08:36.683
What's that? Counterfeit currency
emanating from this bank, it's impossible.

08:36.851 --> 08:39.729
A word one must employ
with the greatest of caution, Mr. Flamm.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.230
Impossible, I say.

08:41.438 --> 08:45.901
Just answer me a question, have there been
any recent changes in personnel?

08:46.110 --> 08:47.945
Let's see.

08:51.073 --> 08:56.996
Yes, our Ms. Pruett left,
the date was May 7th, 1951.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.666
- No, something more recent.
-Nothing whatever, Batman.

09:00.875 --> 09:05.921
Except, of course, our chief teller, he went out
for a sandwich at noon and didn't return.

09:06.130 --> 09:09.967
He did send in a substitute,
I'm pleased to say, Mr. Glee.

09:10.176 --> 09:12.803
That's him over there.

09:15.181 --> 09:21.520
- He had references, of course?
-Of course, Batman, impeccable.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.482
- Thank you.
-Yes.

09:27.193 --> 09:29.779
Notice anything odd, Robin?

09:29.987 --> 09:33.657
- His rather formal attire.
- That and something else.

09:33.866 --> 09:37.328
The way he counts out those bills.
Holy precision.

09:37.536 --> 09:41.415
Indeed, precise
to an almost inhuman degree.

09:41.624 --> 09:45.002
- Something weird about his collar button too.
-Good for you Robin...

09:45.211 --> 09:49.840
...I wondered if you'd noticed.
Now if my strange hunch is right...

09:53.886 --> 10:00.267
- Good afternoon, Mr. Glee. I'm Batman.
-Obviously, sir.

10:02.645 --> 10:05.189
I've been admiring your collar button.

10:06.816 --> 10:08.442
WOW! Oh.

10:08.651 --> 10:12.029
The filthy bat creature touched the lens.

10:13.656 --> 10:19.036
Tell me, Mr. Glee, why is a collar button
like an old pile of burning automobile tires?

10:20.663 --> 10:22.540
Answer. Because they both choke.

10:30.923 --> 10:34.135
Holy clockworks, a mechanical marvel.

10:36.637 --> 10:41.809
I'm flabbergasted, Batman.
How on Earth did you know that was a robot?

10:42.017 --> 10:47.231
Simple, Mr. Flamm, even the most
infallible robots have one defect.

10:47.398 --> 10:48.732
They have no sense of humor.

10:48.941 --> 10:52.528
Batman told him a funny joke.
When the creature didn't laugh that was proof.

10:52.736 --> 10:58.284
Well, you wretched ruin,
I guess we'll take you back to the Batcave.

11:00.953 --> 11:05.249
One last warning, Mr. Flamm. The next time
your chief teller goes out for a sandwich...

11:05.457 --> 11:10.880
...and sends a stranger back in his place,
scrutinize him carefully.

11:11.088 --> 11:14.633
I'm sure I speak for the chairman of the board,
millionaire Bruce Wayne...

11:14.842 --> 11:18.888
...in saying
that you owe that to all of your depositors.

11:19.889 --> 11:22.183
Good day, citizens.

11:28.606 --> 11:30.524
Oh, eureka, look.

11:30.733 --> 11:34.403
Mr. Glee's retriever signal
is coming in as planned. Huh!

11:35.863 --> 11:38.115
- The Batmobile.
-Oh, yes, my sweet.

11:38.324 --> 11:41.076
With Mr. Glee in the trunk. Ha, ha.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.996
We'll give pursuit. We'll find the Batcave.

11:44.205 --> 11:46.749
Quick to the Jokemobile.

11:50.794 --> 11:55.591
Clear the way, you people,
clear the way, please clear the way.

12:03.265 --> 12:08.020
Turn on the portable robot retriever.
Pick up the signal.

12:08.646 --> 12:12.316
- Left on Mulberry.
- Tallyho.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.859
Whoo! What a bat hunt.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.008
Holy honey corn, that's a tracking signal.

12:38.217 --> 12:41.804
Obviously there's a tiny transmitter
built into that robot in the trunk.

12:41.971 --> 12:44.390
- You mean, you knew we were being followed?
-Oh, yes.

12:44.598 --> 12:49.103
What'll we do, Batman, lure them into
an ambush and bash them with our Batarangs?

12:49.311 --> 12:50.521
I have a better notion.

12:50.729 --> 12:54.233
Of course, we'll activate
our trusty Bat-deflector.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.612
Right again, Robin. Turn it on.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.656
Bat-deflector activated.

13:05.744 --> 13:10.082
- How's the retriever signal?
-Stronger than ever, Joker. Faster.

13:24.346 --> 13:27.725
- Right turn.
-Strange, I don't see any road.

13:27.933 --> 13:31.103
Well, I can't help that, Joker,
the signal says right turn.

13:31.312 --> 13:34.356
Oh, how humorous. Ha, ha.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.650
Hold tight for the bumpsy-daisy.

13:51.665 --> 13:56.962
Frabjous day,
moment every super crook has dreamed of.

13:57.171 --> 14:00.049
Look, we've discovered
the entrance to the Batcave.

14:00.257 --> 14:04.386
- Which way from here, Joker?
-Oh, it must be around that little hill.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.305
- Get the gas grenades.
-Roger.

14:06.472 --> 14:11.310
Oh. We'll gas them out of the cave
and get them when they come out.

14:11.518 --> 14:16.273
Death to the blundering bats, tallyho. Ha, ha.

14:18.567 --> 14:24.156
- What's the matter?
-Bizarre, the signal says the Batcave is here.

14:25.282 --> 14:28.577
Look, we've been out-tricked.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.835
"Laugh, criminals, laugh!"

14:42.674 --> 14:48.764
I'll have it.
By all the saints of wicked mirth, I'll have it.

14:48.931 --> 14:52.017
The last laugh will still be mine.

15:02.778 --> 15:06.782
I regret to say, no unusual indications.

15:08.367 --> 15:11.286
We're dealing with a perfectly normal robot.

15:11.495 --> 15:13.914
Holy dead end,
not a clue to where it came from.

15:14.123 --> 15:18.836
Excusing the intrusion, sir, but might I point
out an oddity in this automaton's attire?

15:19.044 --> 15:20.462
By all means, Alfred.

15:20.671 --> 15:24.049
His sleeve, sir, now to my practiced eye,
uh...

15:24.258 --> 15:27.678
...it would appear that it has been pressed
by a most uncommon pressure.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.721
He's right, Batman, look.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.433
The buttons are pushed
almost through the back.

15:32.641 --> 15:38.647
And here, sir, I clearly detect
traces of multicolored, uh, spots...

15:38.856 --> 15:41.525
...which have been frequently,
but clumsily sponged.

15:41.733 --> 15:45.487
Congratulations, Alfred,
you're keen sartorial sense has done it again.

15:45.696 --> 15:48.699
- Thank you, sir.
-Robin, warm up the Bat-Spot Analyzer...

15:48.907 --> 15:53.036
...while I take a sample of this affected cloth.
-Roger.

15:53.912 --> 15:57.541
I'll just snip right through here, Alfred.

15:59.376 --> 16:03.005
- Bat-Spot Analyzer ready to go, Batman.
-Roger.

16:05.382 --> 16:09.470
Now, let's keep our fingers crossed, Robin.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.016
Mm-hm.

16:14.224 --> 16:17.144
- What is it, Batman?
-Those curious spots.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.438
They're minute traces of printer's ink.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.108
Of course, used by Joker
in his counterfeiting operation.

16:23.317 --> 16:24.985
Exactly, transferred to the cloth...

16:25.152 --> 16:29.406
...when that Cheapskate pressed
his robot's wear in his printing press.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.618
Bless my steam iron, how revolting.

16:32.826 --> 16:38.707
Revolting, indeed, Alfred,
like the colors of these inks...

16:38.916 --> 16:45.714
...arsenic green, rotten apple red,
bilious blue.

16:45.923 --> 16:51.929
I believe there's just one sort of legitimate
printing firm that would employ such hues.

16:52.137 --> 16:55.474
- A firm that prints comic books.
-Right again, Robin.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.643
Now to check our Business Index Machine...

16:57.851 --> 17:01.605
...to see if any such firm
has recently changed hands.

17:06.234 --> 17:11.573
Penthouse Publishers sold one week ago
to a certain Mr. W. C. Whiteface.

17:11.781 --> 17:16.662
- Whiteface? Joker.
-More than possible, Robin.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.829
Too bad we have no proof.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.334
Dear me, yes,
but if you were to pounce on them like that...

17:22.542 --> 17:25.712
...you'd lay yourself open
to a most damaging suit for false arrest.

17:25.921 --> 17:29.424
- Gosh, he's got us buffaloed.
-Not quite, Robin.

17:29.633 --> 17:33.595
I have a plan to get that proof.

17:33.804 --> 17:37.474
Listen, here's what we'll do.

17:44.231 --> 17:49.611
Infuriating. Here I am on the brink
of the greatest caper in criminal history...

17:49.820 --> 17:52.906
...and the Dynamic Duo still at large.

18:01.582 --> 18:04.876
I must be dreaming,
it looks like millionaire Bruce Wayne.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.795
- What?
-I'm sure of it, Joker.

18:07.004 --> 18:09.423
I've seen his picture
in the paper hundreds of times.

18:11.216 --> 18:14.595
Robots, amber alert.

18:23.854 --> 18:29.985
I'm ruined, bankrupt, wiped out.

18:30.986 --> 18:33.739
There's only one more chance.

18:34.615 --> 18:39.077
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Whiteface, I failed
to introduce myself, I'm Mr. Bruce Wayne.

18:39.286 --> 18:43.749
- Oh, at your service, sir.
-Thank you. How do you do?

18:45.375 --> 18:50.797
I hardly dare ask it, Mr. Whiteface...

18:51.006 --> 18:53.008
...but do you know anyone...

18:53.216 --> 18:59.681
...who could print me up
a batch of counterfeit currency?

18:59.848 --> 19:00.849
Ooh.

19:01.266 --> 19:05.771
What a curious request to make
of a legitimate business man such as myself.

19:05.979 --> 19:09.066
Yes, I know it does seem a bit odd...

19:09.274 --> 19:15.238
...but you see, I foolishly succumbed
to the temptation of speculation...

19:15.447 --> 19:19.326
...with the funds of the Wayne Foundation,
the results were catastrophic.

19:19.534 --> 19:22.371
Tomorrow is the annual accounting...

19:22.579 --> 19:27.751
...and if I don't have 1 million dollars
in cash...

19:27.959 --> 19:33.215
...I will be headed up the river
without a paddle.

19:34.591 --> 19:39.554
Very interesting, Mr. Wayne,
but, uh, why do you come to me?

19:39.763 --> 19:44.810
I chanced to be thumbing through
one of the comic books that you publish...

19:45.018 --> 19:46.853
...and it struck my eye...

19:47.062 --> 19:49.147
...the inks that you use...

19:49.314 --> 19:56.154
...are identical to the inks
used by the United States Treasury.

19:58.031 --> 20:01.118
- What do you think, sweet Josie?
-Smells like a trap, Joker.

20:01.326 --> 20:07.791
Indeed. On the other hand, the fellow's tale
is so utterly absurd that it could be true.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.587
Uh, just for fun, Mr. Wayne...

20:12.796 --> 20:18.677
...supposing I did provide you
with this whimsical funny money?

20:18.885 --> 20:21.179
Just what would be in it for me'?

20:22.139 --> 20:27.602
I would be happy to appoint you vice chairman
of the Gotham National Bank.

20:27.811 --> 20:33.734
Oh, dear me, yes, that does appeal
to my notorious sense of humor.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.737
Vice chairman of the board
of the Gotham National Bank.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.240
Yes.

20:41.283 --> 20:44.619
I have here a personally signed document...

20:44.786 --> 20:50.000
...appointing you to the position
I previously mentioned.

20:50.208 --> 20:54.004
But before I give it to you, I require proof...

20:54.212 --> 20:58.425
...that you will deliver your end
of this unhappy bargain.

20:58.633 --> 21:01.511
- Proof?
-To wit.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.388
You get the document...

21:03.597 --> 21:09.227
...after you run off a sample of counterfeit
on your press over there.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.188
<i>Hmm.</i>

21:16.902 --> 21:22.532
- Josie, ink the rollers, I'll get the paper. Quick.
-Yes.

21:33.251 --> 21:36.630
- Ready to roll.
-Bingo.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.178
Hold it, Joker, you're under arrest.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.644
Great Scott.
It's the junior half of the Dynamic Duo.

21:51.895 --> 21:56.399
Robin to Batman, while on a routine
anti-crime patrol, I've caught the Joker.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.068
He's plotting with Bruce Wayne.

21:58.985 --> 22:02.948
Situation under control, no need
for you to leave the Batcave. Over and out.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.158
Is that so, Boy Wonder.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.540
Robots, give him a whimsical whammy.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.578
Well, things look grim for our side,
Mr. Whiteface...

22:49.786 --> 22:52.205
...perhaps I should lend them a hand.

22:55.083 --> 22:58.044
You idiot, you're only getting in the way.

23:17.772 --> 23:23.862
Oh, how delicious, the Boy Wonder
about to be pressed flat into a comic book.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.323
Observe.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.054
Mr. Whiteface, this is murder.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.473
Well, how true, Mr. Wayne...

23:51.681 --> 23:56.519
...yes, and just to ensure
against a double-cross, you will perform it.

23:56.728 --> 24:00.357
- Never.
-Boff, Yock, seize him.

24:00.565 --> 24:04.903
Yes, force his hand on the lever.

24:05.111 --> 24:08.031
Gosh, what an ugly twist of fate.
