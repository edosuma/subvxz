00:14.882 --> 00:17.751
David. David, wake up.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.253
Wake up. Come on.

00:23.957 --> 00:27.161
My God, look at this place.
It's a disaster area.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.997
I am not picking up
after you anymore, Mister.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.200
You are 21 years old.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.601
Just give me a chance
to wake up.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.204
How would you like it
if I went into your car

00:36.270 --> 00:38.872
and left my panties
all over the seats?

00:38.939 --> 00:40.374
I said I'll get it.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.276
I don't know
what's going on
with you lately.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.178
You're not doing
drugs, are you?

00:44.245 --> 00:46.147
- No.
- Addiction runs
in our family.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.548
Mom, I'm not on drugs.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.218
Listen, I know it is hard

00:50.284 --> 00:51.652
not having a room of your own

00:51.719 --> 00:53.921
and shuttling between
your dad's place and here.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.489
But we just
have to make it work

00:55.556 --> 00:57.225
just until you go
back to NYU.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.660
I'm not going back to NYU.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.764
So that's it?

01:03.831 --> 01:05.533
Just because you didn't
get into the film program,

01:05.599 --> 01:08.902
you're just going to throw away
your education entirely?

01:08.969 --> 01:10.238
Pretty much.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.805
Oh. Well, what are you
going to do?

01:11.872 --> 01:14.342
I don't know. I'm still
exploring my options.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.144
You get this from your father.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.146
- Get what?
- Just quitting

01:18.212 --> 01:19.413
at the first roadblock
life throws at you,

01:19.480 --> 01:20.848
wallowing in your misery.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.416
It's one of the reasons
we're not married anymore.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.486
Aren't I entitled to be
bummed for a little while?

01:26.587 --> 01:28.222
Yeah. Well,

01:28.289 --> 01:30.458
I expect this place
to get picked up

01:30.524 --> 01:32.726
before I get home from work.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.868
Oh, my neck is so stiff.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.636
- It's stress.
- Yep.

01:42.703 --> 01:43.904
And old age.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.339
Hey,

01:45.406 --> 01:47.808
give her a little smack
on the ass for me, would you?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.277
- Ah.
- Stay here, stay here.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.779
What do you think Skye
is doing right now?

01:51.845 --> 01:55.048
Well, if she's anything like
me during my waitressing days,

01:55.183 --> 01:56.184
she's sleeping in.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.551
- Yeah.
- Harder.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.353
At least we know
she's sleeping alone.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.356
Just saw the nitwit she's
dating in the locker room.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.426
You know,
for such a smart man,

02:05.493 --> 02:07.795
you're really clueless
sometimes.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.330
Hmm?

02:09.397 --> 02:11.299
What does that mean?

02:11.365 --> 02:14.568
It means, my darling,

02:14.635 --> 02:17.571
that the more you
disapprove of this boy,

02:17.638 --> 02:20.674
the more interesting
he's going to be to her.

02:20.741 --> 02:25.679
So if I were you, mm,
I'd make nice with him.

02:25.746 --> 02:26.747
Hmm?

02:29.217 --> 02:30.318
Uch.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.226
- Good morning, Mr. Getty.
- David.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.760
Nash just stepped out
for a minute.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.894
Yeah, no, I don't need Nash.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.796
I need to talk to you.

02:42.863 --> 02:46.967
Listen, I feel like you
and I have gotten off
on the wrong foot this year.

02:47.034 --> 02:47.968
Don't you think?

02:48.035 --> 02:49.803
If you say so.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.240
Uh, I think
I've been a little bit
of a hard-ass on you.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.607
So here's
what I'm proposing.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.243
What do you say
we start over, all right?

02:55.309 --> 02:58.011
We'll just turn over
a new leaf.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.347
We'll wipe the slate clean.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.814
All right?
What do you say?

03:02.250 --> 03:03.317
Okay.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.152
All right. Good.
Hey, here's an idea.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.054
How about we grab lunch
some time in the city?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.889
Uh, just me and you?

03:08.956 --> 03:11.792
Well, you can invite a couple
of hookers if you want.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.962
No hook-- Just you and me.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.697
Yeah. No. Yeah, uh--

03:16.764 --> 03:18.466
Yeah, well, yeah,
I like lunch.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.700
Do you? All right, great.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.469
You know what?
How about tomorrow?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.271
I'll have my secretary
set something up.

03:23.271 --> 03:26.274
All right, man.
Glad we talked. All right.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.311
Okay, uh, median
is the middle value

03:30.378 --> 03:31.712
for a given set
of numbers,

03:31.779 --> 03:34.548
and mean is what we
colloquially call

03:34.615 --> 03:35.649
the average.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.651
What's
colloquialing mean?

03:37.718 --> 03:41.054
Colloquially. It's on
your vocab study list.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.290
All right, you know what?

03:42.323 --> 03:44.024
I think you guys
need some more caffeine.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.659
Can I have another cherry?

03:48.329 --> 03:51.399
Uh, okay. Uh, ahem.
Let's talk math.

03:51.465 --> 03:55.536
All right? So I
came up with a few practice
word problems for you guys.

03:55.603 --> 03:58.906
Uh, so "Two space craft
leave Earth at the same time

03:58.972 --> 04:00.441
"to fly to Alpha Centauri,

04:00.508 --> 04:02.343
which is 4.3
light years away--"

04:02.410 --> 04:05.012
The space shuttle
wasn't designed for
interstellar travel.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.015
These aren't space shuttles.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.917
What are they?

04:09.983 --> 04:11.519
Flying saucer--

04:11.585 --> 04:14.555
one from ELO's album
and one from Boston's.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.590
Why not Journey's?

04:19.126 --> 04:21.329
Eli, are you high?

04:21.329 --> 04:23.096
Come on, man. Don't you smoke?

04:23.163 --> 04:25.866
Whether or not I smoke
is totally irrelevant,

04:25.933 --> 04:27.935
which is also on your
vocab study list.

04:28.001 --> 04:31.439
Come on, guys. I'm not
the one taking the SATs.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.706
You got to focus.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.908
Hey, everybody.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.143
How's it going?

04:36.209 --> 04:37.244
- Good.
- Yeah?

04:37.345 --> 04:38.346
I think, right?

04:38.379 --> 04:39.713
Wheeler's way better

04:39.780 --> 04:41.682
than any of my
teachers at school.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.684
Oh. Well, I suspected
there was a brain

04:43.751 --> 04:45.519
under all those curls.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.220
Well, I'll let you
get back to it.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.922
She's the best.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.859
Looks like Reagan
found his guy
on the Supreme Court.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.462
Scalia.
How about that name?

04:54.528 --> 04:56.664
Sounds like
a spinal condition.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.104
See the guy over there?
White hair?

05:04.171 --> 05:05.973
He's Chip Patrick.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.208
Made a fortune
in tax liens.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.610
You know
what tax liens are?

05:09.677 --> 05:10.911
- No.
- Neither do I.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.145
But whatever they are,

05:12.212 --> 05:14.682
they bought the helicopter
he rides to work.

05:15.683 --> 05:16.984
See that guy over there?

05:17.050 --> 05:18.786
- The red hair? Dopey grin?
- Mm-hmm.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.020
Joe Farrell.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.288
Feldspar Capital?

05:21.389 --> 05:24.157
They do business loans,
some retail.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.959
What do you think
he drives?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.194
Cadillac.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.796
Lamborghini.

05:28.862 --> 05:32.165
Base price $100,000.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.601
I'm guessing that's more

05:33.667 --> 05:35.403
than your parents'
house is worth.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.805
Actually, my parents had
to sell their house.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.773
Did they get $100,000
for it?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.542
- Not quite.
- Well, think about that.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.612
This guy is riding around
in your parents' house,

05:44.678 --> 05:47.981
getting hand jobs from
Sports Illustrated models.

05:48.048 --> 05:52.019
Yeah. Point is there are
a lot of guys out there

05:52.085 --> 05:53.253
making a killing,

05:53.320 --> 05:55.423
and you are of an age

05:55.456 --> 05:56.824
where a young guy
can join the hunt.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.759
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Hey, listen,

05:58.826 --> 06:00.661
I wasn't much older than you.
I had a seat on the Exchange.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.963
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.965
What is your five-year plan?

06:06.700 --> 06:07.868
I don't really have one.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.870
I'm kind of taking
things year to year.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.340
Okay. So what's your
one-year plan?

06:13.441 --> 06:15.709
I guess to figure out
what it is I'm good at

06:15.776 --> 06:17.511
that someone's willing
to pay me to do.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.946
- Mm.
- I used to think

06:19.012 --> 06:21.148
that was to do
with movies, you know?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.551
But, uh, since that doesn't
seem to be in the cards,

06:23.617 --> 06:25.919
I guess I'm back
to exploring my options.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.121
Okay, that's not a plan.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.957
That's called
stalling for time.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.462
You know who you remind me
of a little bit?

06:34.528 --> 06:37.164
My kid brother,
Skye's uncle Marv.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.867
He was a little bit
of a space cadet, too,
when he was your age.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.935
Nice guy. Don't get me wrong.
I love him to death.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.737
But his head's always
in the clouds.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.906
You know
where he wound up?

06:45.973 --> 06:47.340
A chiropractor.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.209
Does he like it?

06:49.276 --> 06:51.111
Who the fuck cares
if he likes it?

06:51.178 --> 06:53.013
He's a glorified masseuse.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.515
He drives a Pinto.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.185
His kids
go to public school.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.822
These are bad things,
I'm saying.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.624
You kn--
Listen, I offer this

07:03.691 --> 07:06.259
as a cautionary tale
of what happens

07:06.326 --> 07:08.328
when you don't choose
a path in life

07:08.395 --> 07:10.664
but you let life
choose for you.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.699
Huh?

07:16.837 --> 07:18.572
Skye used to love
coming here with me.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.374
This was before she
decided meat was murder.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.511
You know,
for a little thing,

07:23.577 --> 07:24.845
she can really
put away a steak.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.213
It's-- It's quite
impressive.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.380
That's funny.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.682
How's that place
she's working?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.417
Yeah, it's pretty good.
The food's decent.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.619
It's a restaurant?

07:31.685 --> 07:32.986
Yeah.
I thought you knew.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.154
No, I did.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.388
I-- I think I forgot.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.790
What-- How's your
steak doing?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.526
Can one person
really eat all this?

07:38.526 --> 07:40.528
A man can.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.536
Hey, there's Susan,
the receptionist,

07:48.602 --> 07:49.870
she's really pretty.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.039
What about Marcia
from payroll?

07:52.105 --> 07:54.542
- She's single.
- Oh, no, no. She's scary.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.909
I mean,
with those long nails.

07:55.976 --> 07:56.944
Those aren't real.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.011
No?

07:58.078 --> 07:59.146
No. Those are press-ons.

07:59.212 --> 08:02.149
Oh. No.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.952
No. I don't think
I'm ready.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.987
I haven't been
on a date in years.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.889
Things haven't changed
that much. You'll be fine.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.423
How'd your meet your wife?

08:10.558 --> 08:13.594
Choir. Yeah,
she took pity on me.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.163
She said, "You've been
staring at me for six months.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.231
When are you going
to ask me out, Terrence?"

08:18.298 --> 08:21.735
So I did, and she said,
"I'll think about it."

08:21.802 --> 08:23.671
Well, it's
probably a little late

08:23.737 --> 08:25.038
for me to become
a Baptist.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.241
You could put
an ad in the classifieds.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.311
What do you mean, like
"Do you like piña coladas?"

08:31.378 --> 08:33.480
Yeah. It's worth a shot.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.948
I don't think I'm going
to get many takers.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.084
A divorced heart patient
seeks nice lady

08:37.150 --> 08:39.219
to sit at home
and watch "Night Court."

08:40.688 --> 08:42.055
I have a cousin named Janice

08:42.122 --> 08:44.291
who just got divorced
about a year ago.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.726
She likes TV, too.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.928
I think you two might
actually hit it off.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.262
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.297
I'll give her a ring.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.632
All right. I'll meet her.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.033
I mean, what do you
have to lose?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.068
Okay. It's a date.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.610
Our entrance.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.045
Just in case I forget my name.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.881
Reception area.
One of our analysts here.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.617
- Sir.
- Most of them don't
know their dicks

09:09.683 --> 09:11.018
from a hole in the ground,

09:11.084 --> 09:12.786
which is why their
predictions are wrong

09:12.853 --> 09:13.954
90% of the time--

09:14.021 --> 09:15.355
I actually keep 'em around

09:15.422 --> 09:17.057
just so I know
what not to buy.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.158
I'm not even joking.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.029
This is my trading floor.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.165
This is where
the magic happens.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.634
Do they ever sit down?

09:26.634 --> 09:28.468
Well, probably to take a crap,

09:28.535 --> 09:29.770
but I couldn't swear to you.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.171
Hey, hey, come here a second.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.640
How old are you?

09:32.673 --> 09:34.041
- Uh, 23.
- Okay.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.743
What did we pay you last year?

09:35.809 --> 09:38.311
With bonus, 125.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.715
We'll get 'em next year.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.254
You afraid of heights,
David?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.122
- No.
- Come here.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.791
Take a look at that.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.226
My old man
was afraid of heights.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.129
His whole life,
all he ever wanted to do

09:56.196 --> 09:58.799
is take a trip west
to see the Grand Canyon.

09:58.866 --> 10:01.101
So finally, I'm a teenager.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.738
We did it. We get
to the Grand Canyon...

10:06.006 --> 10:08.976
and he was too scared
to get out of the car.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.179
So that's where I get it.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.648
Wait a minute.
You're afraid of heights?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.083
Oh, petrified.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.186
It's quite a view,
though, isn't it?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.988
You can almost
see all the way
to Skye's apartment.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.355
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.859
How do you like
her new place?

10:26.994 --> 10:28.628
She hasn't moved in yet.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.297
Right. Of course.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.966
I knew that. I forgot.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.635
- No, you didn't.
- Hmm?

10:35.703 --> 10:37.637
Is that why you
invited me to lunch?

10:37.705 --> 10:39.973
So you could pump me
for info about Skye?

10:40.040 --> 10:43.777
I'm her father. I have a right
to know where she's living,

10:43.844 --> 10:46.246
if her roommates
are ax murderers.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.881
Why didn't you just
ask her yourself?

10:47.948 --> 10:50.250
I would if she'd
return my calls.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.987
Hell's Kitchen.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.890
Really? Jesus.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.158
Fourth floor walk-up,

10:58.225 --> 11:00.260
and her roommates
aren't ax murderers.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.162
One's a junior at the Fashion
Institute of Technology,

11:02.229 --> 11:04.031
and the other is
studying to be a dancer.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.433
Okay.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.768
- Mr. Getty?
- Hmm.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.970
Your lawyers are here.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.441
Okay. Thank you.

11:15.743 --> 11:16.877
All right.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.051
Hi. Is Skye around?

11:24.117 --> 11:25.285
Somewhere.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.920
Could you tell her
that her boyfriend is here?

11:28.756 --> 11:30.657
I didn't know
Skye had a boyfriend.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.059
Well, she does. It's me.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.327
- What's your name?
- David.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.363
Skye, David's here.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.499
Hey.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.001
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.202
What are you doing here?

11:42.269 --> 11:43.771
- Mm.
- Well, I was in the city,

11:43.837 --> 11:45.305
so I thought I'd
stop in and see you.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.606
What were you doing?

11:46.673 --> 11:47.908
- Hmm?
- In the city.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.677
I wanted to catch
a movie at the quad.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.678
What did you see?

11:51.779 --> 11:53.046
The new Woody Allen.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.815
- Hannah and Her Sisters?
- Yeah.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.084
God, wasn't it pedestrian?

11:58.085 --> 12:00.020
Actually,
I really liked it.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.689
Zan is a filmmaker, too.
You guys should talk.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.657
Oh, cool. What kind of stuff?

12:04.792 --> 12:06.693
I'm actually
a visual artist.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.095
My stuff's not narrative.

12:08.161 --> 12:08.929
Underground,

12:08.996 --> 12:10.798
like Jonas Mekas,

12:10.864 --> 12:13.300
Stan Brakhage,
Kenneth Anger,

12:13.366 --> 12:15.402
but not so homoerotic.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.703
You?

12:16.804 --> 12:19.139
Tomorrow I'm
videotaping a bris.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.274
You mean like...

12:22.575 --> 12:23.676
Yeah.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.145
David's work
is very experimental.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.848
Or, I guess,
uh, confrontational

12:27.915 --> 12:29.549
is a better word.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.218
Come on. Come here.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.827
I feel like we never get
to see each other anymore.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.094
I know. It's a drag.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.131
Hey, hey.
Would you get in trouble

12:44.197 --> 12:45.665
if we had sex
somewhere in here?

12:45.732 --> 12:48.568
Probably. And I
really need this job.

12:48.635 --> 12:49.837
Okay.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.107
Mm. I have an idea.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.209
Why don't you go wait
at Serge and Alex's

12:56.276 --> 12:57.110
until I'm done?

12:57.177 --> 12:58.846
What time
do you get off work?

12:58.846 --> 13:00.280
- Around 1.
- I have to be up early

13:00.347 --> 13:02.549
to get my gear together
for the Feinberg bris.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.586
I'll make it
worth your while.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.921
Okay.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.539
Hi, Herb. I didn't know
you knew the Feinbergs.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.275
I don't. I'm crashing.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.176
A bris?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.610
Well, it was this
or a funeral,

13:30.677 --> 13:32.946
and I was more
in the mood for deli.

13:35.682 --> 13:36.884
Boychik.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.485
Hey, Nash.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.053
This is quite the spread.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.655
Are brises
usually this lavish?

13:42.722 --> 13:45.158
- Sometimes.
- Hmm. I simply must
go to more of them.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.227
How are things
with Widow Horowitz?

13:47.294 --> 13:49.529
Oh, we had the most
romantic evening.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.899
Wine, candlelight, tiramisu.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.500
- Who paid?
- Don't be so boorish.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.802
I did, of course.
I'm a gentleman,
not a gigolo.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.670
Besides, I consider it
an investment

13:57.737 --> 13:59.239
in my future happiness.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.473
Chachi.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.543
Uh, I'll catch up
with you later.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.412
- Hey, Nash.
- Barry.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.314
Want to pose with that
pig in a blanket for me?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.216
- Absolutely I do.
- Dip it in the
mustard for me.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.551
Just the tip.
Just the tip.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.120
Oh, you are very good.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.023
Vodka tonic.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.958
Vodka tonic coming right up.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.659
Thank you, Webber.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.930
Uh, it's Wheeler, sir.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.197
If you say so.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.133
- Hey, where, uh--
- It is.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.700
Where the hell
is everybody today?

14:27.767 --> 14:29.569
Uh, Dr. Feinberg's sir.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.104
- Feinberg?
- Mm-hmm.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.839
Why are they at Feinberg's?

14:32.940 --> 14:34.607
Uh, he just had a baby boy.

14:34.674 --> 14:35.943
It's his bris.

14:36.009 --> 14:39.279
Oh, is he clever.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.847
Son of a bitch.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.150
He's campaigning
with his son's dick.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.985
That's what this is.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.554
I'm-- I'm honestly
not sure, sir.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.368
Amen.

15:53.853 --> 15:57.624
- Hi, Mr. Myers.
- Karen. What
a lovely surprise.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.791
Who's this, your fiancé?

15:58.858 --> 16:00.493
Very funny. This is Gracie.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.295
- Hello, Gracie.
- Yeah, she's sweet, huh?

16:02.362 --> 16:03.696
She's actually
the reason I'm here.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.832
- Oh, yeah? How's that?
- Well, I was wondering

16:05.898 --> 16:07.600
if maybe you could
do me a huge favor

16:07.667 --> 16:09.869
and take care of her for me?

16:09.936 --> 16:11.404
What? For how long?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.106
Forever?

16:13.173 --> 16:15.342
Look, my fiancé Barry
is really allergic,

16:15.408 --> 16:18.245
and I thought, you know,
you can use the company.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.912
Karen, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.314
I mean, I can barely
take care of myself

16:21.381 --> 16:23.516
with the laundry and cooking.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.352
I already killed
all my house plants.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.586
Please.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.956
I don't know the first
thing about cats.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.125
They are so easy,
and you won't
even know she's here.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.626
You know, she barely even meows,

16:33.693 --> 16:35.195
and she does all her
business in a litter box.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.130
See, that sounds
unhygienic to me.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.798
She's my baby,

16:38.865 --> 16:41.334
and I couldn't just
take her to the SPCA.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.337
Okay.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.610
Here you go.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.911
So what do I do,

16:51.978 --> 16:53.713
I buy her mice and feed it
to her every once in a while?

16:53.780 --> 16:55.282
Hold on.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.085
This is everything
she needs.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.386
Well, except
for the cuddles,

16:59.452 --> 17:01.221
but you seem
pretty good at that.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.357
Oh, you're bleeding.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.525
I am?

17:05.592 --> 17:06.693
Cut yourself shaving?

17:06.759 --> 17:07.960
Cut it pretty good.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.562
- Mm.
- And all better.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.931
So how are the wedding
plans coming?

17:11.998 --> 17:13.433
They're fine.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.436
The big day's going to be
here any moment now.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.004
Yeah.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.107
Marriage is a wonderful thing.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.509
I know it sounds corny,
but it's true.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.111
I miss it.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.350
I'm going to have
the half price
poppers, please.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.152
Those are only
half price for ladies.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.121
Really?

17:34.121 --> 17:35.322
Is that legal?

17:35.388 --> 17:36.956
It's our Ladies' Night
special.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.126
Oh.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.428
Well, I'm meeting
a lady friend here.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.697
She's just
running a couple
of minutes late.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.167
Okay.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.774
Hi. I'm supposed to be
meeting someone here.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.143
Tall, in his 50s.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.910
Said he's wearing
a brown turtleneck.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.246
Thank you.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.681
Got any, like, ketchup
or cocktail sauce?

18:01.748 --> 18:04.384
Anything like that.
These are great.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.018
- Thanks.
- Cheddar, right?

18:06.153 --> 18:08.288
Cheddar puffs are
better than I remember.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.158
Table for four, please.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.661
Why the long face,
Fellini?

18:14.727 --> 18:16.296
Someone leave the cake
out in the rain?

18:16.363 --> 18:17.964
What? No. I was just--

18:18.030 --> 18:19.566
I was going to--
What do you want?

18:19.632 --> 18:22.635
We need to talk about
the elephant in the room.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.803
What's that?

18:23.870 --> 18:27.440
It's a metaphor.
Or simile.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.609
Right. Well, I have a ton
of footage to edit,

18:29.676 --> 18:30.910
so maybe another time.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.512
You can't keep doing this.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.646
Doing what?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.282
Running from me.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.450
We're going to keep
bumping into each other.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.319
There comes a time
in a young man's life

18:39.386 --> 18:40.887
when he must face
his demons.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.522
Okay, look,
you're not my demon,

18:42.589 --> 18:44.524
and if my memory serves,
I already faced you,

18:44.591 --> 18:45.925
like with my fist
in your face.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.527
When you sucker punched me?

18:47.594 --> 18:49.061
That wasn't a sucker punch.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.530
A little bit.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.964
You were looking
right at me.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.400
I was lost in thought.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.202
Let's not quibble about
who threw the first punch.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.036
There was only one.
I threw it.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.538
And I respect you for that.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.507
What? You do?

19:00.573 --> 19:01.774
Of course.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.876
I stole your lady from you.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.478
That's heavy shit.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.614
I'm not saying I'm sorry.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.450
All's fair in love and war,
and she's happier with me.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.752
But you acted with honor.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.321
Faced me like a man.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.756
Didn't go down
without a fight.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.558
And I respect that.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.228
Okay.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.896
So...hatchet buried?

19:25.632 --> 19:26.866
I guess.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.338
Hey, you want to cut
that baby dick footage

19:31.404 --> 19:34.707
on a pro rig, go see my buddy
Travis over at WZVX.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.676
- Channel 87?
- Took a bunch of boudoir shots

19:36.743 --> 19:39.312
of him and his old lady,
so he owes me.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.380
Tell him I sent you.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.582
He'll hook you up.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.827
Is anyone sitting here?

19:56.062 --> 19:57.264
No. No.
Go ahead. Take it.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.531
Thank you.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.908
Lady friend stand you up?

20:08.975 --> 20:11.344
Seems like.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.746
I'll tell you what.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.081
Next round's on me.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.184
Uh, no, thank you.
I got to, uh--

20:18.251 --> 20:19.452
Come on.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.222
You know what I'll have

20:23.290 --> 20:25.325
is a, uh-- Let me have
a scotch up, please.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.526
You got it.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.396
* This is the night *

20:29.462 --> 20:31.531
* This is the night *

20:31.598 --> 20:33.466
* This is the time *

20:33.533 --> 20:35.268
- * We've got to get it right *
- Thank you.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.538
* Touch me, touch me *

20:38.605 --> 20:41.240
*I want to feel your body *

20:41.308 --> 20:43.276
* Your heartbeat... *

20:45.545 --> 20:48.481
Okay, okay, but seriously,
I don't know who's in it.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.150
Oh, uh, Robert Redford,
Darryl Hannah,

20:51.217 --> 20:52.118
- and Debra Winger.
- Ooh.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.252
Mm.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.721
I love Darryl Hannah.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.189
What was that one
that she was in

20:57.256 --> 20:59.225
where she played the fish?

20:59.292 --> 21:00.393
Fish?

21:00.460 --> 21:01.761
No, no, mermaid.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.331
- Uh, but is a mermaid...
- Fish.

21:04.331 --> 21:05.332
a fish.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.966
Mermaids do not exist.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.103
Right, obviously.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.405
But I think
you mean Splash.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.240
Yeah, Splash. That's--

21:14.341 --> 21:16.242
How funny was that?

21:16.343 --> 21:17.844
Debra Winger isn't
too shabby, either.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.847
Oh, my God.
Officer And a Gentleman,

21:20.913 --> 21:24.384
when Richard Gere
is all dressed
in his Navy uniform

21:24.451 --> 21:27.954
and he sweeps her
off her feet, and--

21:31.824 --> 21:33.926
Yeah, well, as someone
who was married

21:33.993 --> 21:35.928
- to a guy who's ex-Navy--
- Uch.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.097
...I can tell you
it ain't like the movies.

21:38.164 --> 21:41.968
If Roger lifted anything
heavier than a laundry basket,

21:42.034 --> 21:43.603
he'd throw his back out.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.271
If he lifted a foot,

21:45.372 --> 21:46.406
he'd throw his back out.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.840
- Oh, my--
- Poor man.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.176
* ...these dirty sidewalks *

21:50.242 --> 21:51.478
*of Broadway *

21:51.544 --> 21:53.012
I can't believe I stayed
with him so long.

21:53.079 --> 21:58.385
* Where hustle's
the name of the game *

21:58.418 --> 22:01.488
* Nice guys get washed away *

22:01.554 --> 22:04.023
* Like the snow
and the rain *

22:05.658 --> 22:09.396
* There's been a load
of compromising *

22:10.397 --> 22:13.500
* On the road to my horizon *

22:14.567 --> 22:16.903
* But I'm gonna be *

22:16.969 --> 22:21.674
* Where the lights
are shining on me *

22:21.741 --> 22:25.678
*Like a rhinestone cowboy *

22:26.713 --> 22:29.181
* Riding out on a horse *

22:29.248 --> 22:33.820
*In a star-spangled rodeo *

22:33.886 --> 22:37.957
* Like a rhinestone cowboy *

22:39.426 --> 22:41.728
*Gettin' cards and letters *

22:41.794 --> 22:46.433
*From people
I don't even know *

22:48.601 --> 22:50.269
How did this happen?

22:50.336 --> 22:51.571
What do I know?

22:51.638 --> 22:53.806
Your father never drinks.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.442
Or sings.

22:55.508 --> 22:58.010
He's been a little
down lately.

22:58.077 --> 23:01.047
Both my boys been going
through a rough patch lately.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.148
Yeah.

23:06.018 --> 23:06.986
Wait, have you eaten?

23:07.053 --> 23:08.621
No. I'm starving.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.057
Come on. Let's go
get a bite to eat.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.825
What are you in the mood for?

23:12.892 --> 23:15.127
Uh, you think Friendly's
is still open?

23:15.194 --> 23:16.996
Oh, good idea.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.231
* I've been walkin'
these streets *

23:19.298 --> 23:20.700
* So long *

23:21.834 --> 23:24.771
*Singin' the same old song *

23:25.838 --> 23:27.607
* I know every crack *

23:27.674 --> 23:32.078
* In these dirty
sidewalks of Broadway *

23:33.980 --> 23:38.084
*Where hustle's
the name of the game *

23:38.150 --> 23:40.953
*And nice guys
get washed away *

23:41.020 --> 23:43.890
* Like the snow and the rain *

23:45.992 --> 23:49.896
*There's been a load
of compromisin' *

23:49.962 --> 23:54.734
*On the road to my horizon *

23:54.801 --> 23:56.969
* But I'm gonna be *

23:57.036 --> 24:02.308
*Where the lights
are shinin' on me *

24:02.374 --> 24:05.612
*Like a rhinestone cowboy *

24:07.514 --> 24:09.682
*Riding out on a horse *

24:09.749 --> 24:13.219
*In a star-spangled rodeo *

24:14.854 --> 24:17.924
*Like a rhinestone cowboy *

24:19.992 --> 24:21.761
* Getting cards and letters *

24:21.828 --> 24:26.165
* From people
I don't even know *

24:26.232 --> 24:30.970
* And offers coming
over the phone *
