WEBVTT

00:20.433 --> 00:21.900
My life is over!

00:23.367 --> 00:24.433
The dryer is broken!

00:24.500 --> 00:25.600
What setting did you use?

00:25.667 --> 00:28.200
Doesn't it just... start?

00:28.267 --> 00:29.500
Yes,

00:29.567 --> 00:31.633
and then the tooth fairy
adds fabric softener.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.533
Liam gave it to me!

00:33.600 --> 00:34.433
Oof!

00:34.500 --> 00:35.500
Say what?

00:35.567 --> 00:36.633
Who now?

00:36.700 --> 00:38.667
The star pitcher
of the baseball team.

00:38.733 --> 00:40.600
And why are we
interested in him

00:40.667 --> 00:41.833
this fine morning?

00:41.900 --> 00:44.600
Uh, we're... you know.

00:44.667 --> 00:46.000
No, I don't.

00:46.067 --> 00:47.567
You're kinda... what, Mirabel?

00:47.633 --> 00:49.667
Nothing, Daddy.

00:49.733 --> 00:51.800
He's cute, that's all.

00:51.867 --> 00:54.867
What happened to Cole?

00:54.933 --> 00:56.600
Eh... it's over.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.300
And it's starting.

00:58.367 --> 00:59.567
Okay, then.

00:59.633 --> 01:01.967
And, uh, what are we
reading this morning?

01:02.067 --> 01:03.500
An eye-opening
introduction

01:03.567 --> 01:05.333
to feminism.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.933
Ah. Okay.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.467
Liam just posted
a selfie of us,

01:08.533 --> 01:09.900
so we're practically engaged.

01:11.467 --> 01:12.767
Relax, Daddy.

01:12.833 --> 01:13.733
I'm kidding.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.067
Marriage

01:16.067 --> 01:18.367
is an archaic institution
built to barter women.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.767
You need to chill
ever so slightly,

01:20.833 --> 01:21.833
mini Miss Steinem.

01:22.833 --> 01:23.967
Breakfast is served!

01:26.667 --> 01:27.567
It's a breakfast taco.

01:27.633 --> 01:29.300
That's not
a thing.

01:29.367 --> 01:30.833
You really need to do

01:30.900 --> 01:32.067
a load of dishes.

01:32.067 --> 01:32.967
Let's just
call Abuela.

01:33.067 --> 01:34.767
Mm, not an option.

01:34.833 --> 01:35.867
Your grandmother's
moved out.

01:35.933 --> 01:36.933
We are on our own,

01:37.067 --> 01:38.700
and we can handle this, girls.

01:40.733 --> 01:41.833
I don't understand,

01:41.900 --> 01:43.567
we were doing so well
at first.

01:43.633 --> 01:46.267
Well, Abuela did fire
the last housekeeper.

01:46.333 --> 01:47.800
And the one before that,

01:47.867 --> 01:49.367
and the one before that.

01:49.433 --> 01:51.633
You really need
to go shopping, Daddy.

01:51.700 --> 01:52.700
It's your job.

01:55.633 --> 01:59.300
All right, all right,
um, let's make a...

01:59.367 --> 02:00.567
a list.

02:02.467 --> 02:03.900
Abuela never had a list.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.067
Well, isn't she perfect?

02:40.100 --> 02:41.567
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.067
So?

02:44.567 --> 02:47.533
Gluten-free low-cal
brown-rice pasta?

02:47.600 --> 02:48.833
Really?

02:48.900 --> 02:51.067
You're letting them
push you around, Hijo.

02:51.133 --> 02:52.700
No, no, it's fine.

02:52.767 --> 02:55.067
I like to try new things...

02:55.100 --> 02:56.500
that sound like
they taste like cardboard.

02:57.633 --> 02:59.733
So, how's everything at home?

02:59.800 --> 03:01.800
Good.

03:01.867 --> 03:03.433
Great, actually.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.200
Yeah....

03:06.267 --> 03:09.567
I bet you don't miss
pushing this tank around.

03:09.633 --> 03:11.400
You know, I didn't mind
those workouts.

03:11.467 --> 03:12.633
How are my girls?

03:13.900 --> 03:15.567
Hang on, Rosa.

03:15.633 --> 03:16.567
Hello?

03:16.633 --> 03:18.933
You need to get here, stat!

03:19.067 --> 03:20.600
This isn't a good time.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.567
I'm, uh, I'm grocery shopping.

03:23.633 --> 03:24.767
I would love to be
grocery shopping,

03:24.833 --> 03:27.067
but every trainer
was hit with the flu,

03:27.100 --> 03:28.800
and I'm here by myself,

03:28.867 --> 03:30.767
and the A.C. broke!

03:30.833 --> 03:32.433
O-Okay.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.867
Okay, I'll get there when I can.

03:33.933 --> 03:36.900
I've got single Dad stuff
going on up in here, Steph.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.467
Is everything all right?

03:38.533 --> 03:40.500
Yup! Yup, just gotta
get to the gym.

03:40.567 --> 03:42.867
Can I help you in any way?

03:42.933 --> 03:44.933
Oh, no thanks, I'm good!

03:46.933 --> 03:48.167
Hmm.

03:58.167 --> 04:00.467
All right, everyone,
pencils down.

04:02.333 --> 04:05.267
I know pop quizzes
are not popular,

04:05.333 --> 04:06.767
but they do keep you
on your toes.

04:09.067 --> 04:10.767
What's this?

04:11.800 --> 04:13.933
I'm sorry, I...

04:14.067 --> 04:15.133
I fell asleep.

04:34.900 --> 04:35.933
What happened
to this place?

04:36.067 --> 04:36.967
Where have you been?

04:37.067 --> 04:38.933
We are roasting alive in here!

04:39.067 --> 04:39.867
Okay, I'm on it.

05:08.833 --> 05:11.800
Hmm... maybe just
one quick check-in.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.167
Someone
get the phone!

05:23.233 --> 05:24.933
I'm already
on the phone!

05:25.067 --> 05:27.067
The house phone!

05:27.133 --> 05:30.067
Elisa, get the phone!

05:32.067 --> 05:35.100
Guess no one needs
their Abuela anymore.

05:40.867 --> 05:42.967
Maybe I'll get a cat.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.300
Hey, Rosa.

05:53.367 --> 05:54.267
Ricky?

05:54.333 --> 05:55.933
I can't get a hold of anyone.

05:56.067 --> 05:57.100
Where are the girls?

05:57.167 --> 05:58.767
Everything's fine.

05:58.833 --> 06:00.700
But nobody's
answering their phone.

06:00.767 --> 06:02.733
I'm kind of
in the middle of something here,

06:02.800 --> 06:03.733
I gotta jump.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.067
Where are you jumping to?

06:05.133 --> 06:06.800
I'm going over there.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.300
No, you don't need
to go over there, it's fine.

06:09.367 --> 06:11.200
Look, I-I'll talk to you later.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.733
Steph?

06:22.800 --> 06:23.733
Where are you?

06:23.800 --> 06:24.900
Things are falling apart here.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.300
I'm here.

06:26.367 --> 06:28.233
I'm in the back, trying to fix
this stupid panel.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.900
Okay, could you hurry up?

06:29.967 --> 06:31.600
Doing my best, boss.

06:51.267 --> 06:52.467
What the--?

06:52.533 --> 06:54.767
It's for my project
on Feminism.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.333
There's so many patriarchal,

06:56.400 --> 06:58.433
pre-conceived notions
of women's work

06:58.500 --> 07:00.133
that still affects us
to this day.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.267
I mean, look at you,

07:02.333 --> 07:04.067
cooking,
barefoot in the kitchen.

07:05.067 --> 07:06.533
I don't do carbs.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.367
Yeah, and I was kind of
in the mood for pizza.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.167
Working hard, are we?

07:20.300 --> 07:21.433
It is work.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.733
I've decided
to become Instafamous.

07:23.800 --> 07:24.900
What's that?

07:24.967 --> 07:27.333
If I get enough followers,

07:27.400 --> 07:28.433
companies will ask me

07:28.500 --> 07:29.800
to take pictures
of their products,

07:29.867 --> 07:32.400
and then I'll be making
cash money, baby.

07:32.467 --> 07:35.067
That's what it means
to become Instafamous.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.167
So your self-confidence
is dependent

07:37.233 --> 07:38.433
on how many likes you get?

07:38.500 --> 07:41.167
Of course not,
it's how many hearts I get.

07:45.167 --> 07:46.800
Can someone help me
clean the dishes?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.200
We still have no detergent.

07:48.267 --> 07:49.633
Our schedule's pretty full.

07:49.700 --> 07:50.867
I don't care!

07:50.933 --> 07:52.167
Get in the kitchen
and start scrubbing!

07:52.233 --> 07:54.067
Oh, so just because
I'm a woman,

07:54.100 --> 07:55.267
I have to be
in the kitchen scrubbing?

07:55.333 --> 07:57.067
I'm a woman, too!

07:57.067 --> 07:59.267
Mm... not so much.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.233
I'll handle it.

08:18.867 --> 08:20.067
I'm pretty sure

08:20.067 --> 08:21.100
I've almost figured out
how to fix--

08:21.167 --> 08:22.967
this.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.067
I think it's getting hotter.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.467
Can you call someone, Ricky?

08:25.533 --> 08:27.367
Stop being such a guy.

08:27.433 --> 08:29.167
I can handle this.

08:32.933 --> 08:33.900
Hello?

08:33.967 --> 08:35.900
Yes, this is he.

08:37.367 --> 08:39.733
O-o-okay, sure.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.467
Tomorrow afternoon.

08:44.233 --> 08:45.733
That was Elisa's teacher.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.333
She wants to meet with me.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.567
There he is!

09:06.533 --> 09:07.367
Figured I'd up the security
around here,

09:07.433 --> 09:09.400
add some locks.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.933
Plus, the book club's
watchin Magic Mike.

09:12.067 --> 09:12.800
Again.

09:14.067 --> 09:15.833
You're back late,
you got a story for me?

09:15.900 --> 09:18.100
There was so much sweat.

09:18.167 --> 09:19.233
It was so hot.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.967
That sounds like a story.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.500
Oh... oh, relax,

09:23.567 --> 09:25.400
the A.C. broke at the gym.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.300
I'm exhausted,

09:27.367 --> 09:29.233
and hungry.

09:31.067 --> 09:33.333
Oh, God, the groceries.

09:39.700 --> 09:43.100
Welcome to parenting,
my friend, it is never-ending.

09:43.167 --> 09:44.833
The ice cream's
all over everything.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.133
Oh, my goodness,

09:46.200 --> 09:48.500
Is that "Impeachment"?
I love that flavor!

09:48.567 --> 09:50.300
I'll help you out
with that, buddy.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.900
Todd, it-
it's melted.

09:53.967 --> 09:54.933
Yeah, I know.

09:55.067 --> 09:56.400
I like to get out
a big glass,

09:56.467 --> 09:58.333
pour it in there, and just
drink it like a smoothie.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.833
That's gross.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.500
I know.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.800
See ya.

10:11.433 --> 10:14.600
Ice cream melted,
groceries are ruined!

10:14.667 --> 10:16.500
It's all going
straight in the trash.

10:16.567 --> 10:17.800
The trash is overflowing.

10:18.967 --> 10:20.933
-Again?
-Yeah.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.300
Someone doesn't do her chores.

10:22.367 --> 10:24.900
Says the girl who irons
with a hair straightener.

10:24.967 --> 10:27.433
It's perfect for collars.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.567
Did you remember
the dishwasher detergent?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.100
I'll get it tomorrow.

10:36.167 --> 10:37.233
Hey, wh-where's Elisa?

11:19.067 --> 11:19.967
Hi, Daddy.

11:21.267 --> 11:22.200
Hey there.

11:24.967 --> 11:26.467
I'm so tired...

11:28.233 --> 11:29.500
I know, honey.

11:29.567 --> 11:31.533
Go back to sleep.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.600
Just remember
to unplug the toaster.

11:36.300 --> 11:37.267
What?

11:37.333 --> 11:40.900
And clean the coffee pot...

11:43.567 --> 11:45.067
I got it.

11:46.567 --> 11:47.633
I will.

11:50.433 --> 11:52.467
I love you.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.300
Where's Dad?

12:19.367 --> 12:20.533
The A.C. at
the gym is out.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.733
He left early.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.333
He could have
at least opened them.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.467
Why can't you do it?

12:25.533 --> 12:27.067
My nails
are drying.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.133
Your problem,

12:28.200 --> 12:29.400
and that's the most
ridiculous thing

12:29.467 --> 12:31.400
I've ever heard.

12:31.467 --> 12:32.633
One day,
you'll understand.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.533
I hope not.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.133
You've reached Rosa.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.467
Please leave me a message.

12:41.067 --> 12:42.200
Abuela?

12:42.267 --> 12:43.700
It's me.

12:43.767 --> 12:46.300
Things have gotten crazy
since you left...

12:52.400 --> 12:54.067
Hey, everybody, Frank here.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.633
Today's video is going to be

12:55.700 --> 12:59.467
how to replace a circuit
breaker
in an electrical panel.

12:59.533 --> 13:01.767
Okay? Couple of
really important steps.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.167
Ugh...

13:03.233 --> 13:07.600
Warm in here,
isn't it?

13:10.333 --> 13:11.400
I'm sorry,

13:11.467 --> 13:13.267
I think I have
Zika or something.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.667
Go home.

13:14.733 --> 13:15.667
All right.

13:15.733 --> 13:17.067
Is it me, or is it...

13:17.133 --> 13:18.400
it is hotter out here
than it is there, right?

13:18.467 --> 13:19.433
A little Column A,

13:19.500 --> 13:21.333
and whole lotta Column B.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.567
Please,
call a repairman.

13:22.633 --> 13:23.700
Call someone.

13:23.767 --> 13:25.500
Pay someone.
Ask for help.

13:25.567 --> 13:26.967
No, see that's the problem.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.733
Everyone wants to pass the buck
when times get tough,

13:28.800 --> 13:30.733
no one wants to try
and do it themselves first.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.233
You don't know
what you're doing!

13:33.567 --> 13:35.900
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

13:35.967 --> 13:37.133
Are you sure you guys
want me to go home?

13:37.200 --> 13:38.167
Yes!

13:38.233 --> 13:39.367
Okay, good call.

13:41.567 --> 13:42.700
Are you okay?

13:42.767 --> 13:44.200
Oh, it's just...

13:44.267 --> 13:45.767
You know, I-I'm not gonna
have time to get dinner tonight,

13:45.833 --> 13:47.133
I didn't have time
to get dinner last night, and--

13:47.200 --> 13:48.500
I feel ya.

13:48.567 --> 13:49.633
Between the gym and school,

13:49.700 --> 13:52.333
I am on a Redbull
and cereal diet...

13:52.400 --> 13:54.667
But I-I don't have kids.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.200
Your point?

13:56.267 --> 13:58.667
I think you're
spreading yourself thin.

13:58.733 --> 14:00.300
I don't want to preach,

14:00.367 --> 14:03.200
but I think your Dad duties
should definitely come first.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.067
Aw, I gotta meet
Elisa's teacher,

14:07.133 --> 14:08.100
and I'm already late!

14:08.167 --> 14:09.067
No--

14:09.133 --> 14:10.100
Aw...

14:17.333 --> 14:18.400
Yes.

14:22.633 --> 14:24.467
I'm sorry I'm late, I--

14:24.533 --> 14:26.100
Mr. Cooper,
thank you for coming.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.833
Oh, please, call me Ricky.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.300
All right. Uh...

14:30.533 --> 14:32.233
You look just
as tired as Elisa.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.633
Elisa?

14:33.700 --> 14:34.767
Tired?

14:34.833 --> 14:36.433
Yeah, that's why
I called.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.600
I'm concerned.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.500
She fell asleep
in class last week,

14:39.567 --> 14:40.833
and then again
yesterday,

14:40.900 --> 14:43.200
only this time
it was during a test.

14:43.267 --> 14:46.367
Don't worry, I'm gonna
let her do a make-up test.

14:46.433 --> 14:47.800
Thank you.

14:47.867 --> 14:50.433
You know, it's just
not like her.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.300
She seems exhausted
and stressed out.

14:54.367 --> 14:55.400
You're a single dad?

14:57.067 --> 14:58.567
Yeah.

14:58.633 --> 14:59.767
And does
she end up doing

14:59.833 --> 15:01.233
most of the housework
at home?

15:02.700 --> 15:03.900
The students,

15:03.967 --> 15:05.800
they had a creative writing
assignment on "fun."

15:05.867 --> 15:08.633
While most of the kids
wrote about the beach

15:08.700 --> 15:10.567
or Pokemon Go...

15:10.633 --> 15:14.300
she wrote
about a vacuum cleaner.

15:14.367 --> 15:18.800
"Ode to the Vacuum Cleaner,
the only one that helps."

15:20.333 --> 15:21.567
Poor kid, I...

15:23.300 --> 15:25.200
She does take on a lot.

15:25.267 --> 15:28.733
You know, if there's anything
that I can do to help...

15:28.800 --> 15:30.333
What, you want
to come over

15:30.400 --> 15:32.633
and spray
some counter tops?

15:33.767 --> 15:34.667
I was thinking more
along the lines

15:34.733 --> 15:35.933
of a coffee?

15:36.067 --> 15:38.200
You know, I know Elisa
pretty well

15:38.267 --> 15:39.633
in a different context,

15:39.700 --> 15:42.167
and, um, maybe I can offer
some sort of insight?

15:43.600 --> 15:44.667
Uh...

15:44.733 --> 15:46.667
Yeah, yeah, okay,

15:46.733 --> 15:48.633
I'd love that.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.167
Ricky C.

16:19.233 --> 16:20.133
Hey...

16:20.200 --> 16:21.833
Ah, what are you reading?

16:21.900 --> 16:24.533
Uh, "Forbidden Attraction,
Acceptable Love."

16:24.600 --> 16:26.367
Pretty powerful stuff, man.

16:26.433 --> 16:28.500
I mean, a love like theirs?

16:28.567 --> 16:29.833
I haven't read it.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.467
Oh, yeah, no,

16:31.533 --> 16:32.867
I mean, normally, I wouldn't,

16:32.933 --> 16:35.267
but I'm just helping out
the wife with her book club.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.367
Uh-huh.

16:36.433 --> 16:38.233
Well, you seem pretty engrossed.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.500
Enough about me.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.333
Uh, what about you?
Any new dates?

16:43.400 --> 16:44.733
Uh, maybe.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.733
I, uh, I met Elisa's teacher.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.267
She asked me out.

16:48.333 --> 16:49.667
Are you flipping kidding me?

16:49.733 --> 16:51.333
I love a woman
who takes charge.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.833
Hot for teacher.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.433
Come on,
over to the T-Cave.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.800
I can't, I can't,
I've got some work to do,

16:55.867 --> 16:58.800
but you're welcome to help
scrub floors.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.667
I should really finish this up.

17:01.733 --> 17:02.867
I just stopped by to say hi.

17:02.933 --> 17:03.800
-Hi.
-Bye.

17:03.867 --> 17:05.300
Bye.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.833
Mirabel!

17:46.900 --> 17:48.600
Hey, Mirabel!

17:53.967 --> 17:55.567
Mirabel!

17:55.633 --> 17:56.633
And...cut.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.867
Dad you're ruining
my YouTube channel!

17:58.933 --> 18:00.933
Th-there's a boy in your room,

18:01.067 --> 18:01.967
and the door is closed,

18:02.067 --> 18:02.933
and there's a camera,

18:03.067 --> 18:04.067
and spandex?

18:04.100 --> 18:05.467
This is over. Now!

18:05.533 --> 18:06.533
But, Dad,
we have to finish.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.700
You're the new pitcher, huh?

18:11.767 --> 18:12.833
Yeah, Liam.

18:12.900 --> 18:13.967
Nice to meet you, sir.

18:17.433 --> 18:18.733
Look, Mirabel,
you know the rules,

18:18.800 --> 18:19.767
no boys in your room,

18:19.833 --> 18:20.767
until you're 30.

18:20.833 --> 18:21.733
But, Dad--

18:21.800 --> 18:23.067
No buts,

18:23.100 --> 18:24.067
and we're having
a family meeting in the kitchen.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.767
So can just go

18:25.833 --> 18:26.967
work on your change-up
there, okay?

18:27.067 --> 18:28.067
Bye-bye.

18:32.567 --> 18:33.767
Camera.

18:37.967 --> 18:39.700
Dad!

18:39.767 --> 18:41.400
A YouTube thing?
Really?

18:53.567 --> 18:55.633
Is anyone doing
anything normal?

18:59.067 --> 19:01.867
Normalcy, like gender,
is a social construct, Dad.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.100
Right.

19:03.167 --> 19:04.767
I'm gonna need you
in the kitchen.

19:05.700 --> 19:06.800
Because that's my place?

19:06.867 --> 19:08.800
As a woman?

19:08.867 --> 19:11.767
It's your place
as a member of this family.

19:14.633 --> 19:15.633
Elisa...

19:17.567 --> 19:20.100
It's great
that you want to help out,

19:20.167 --> 19:21.900
but I'm the Dad.

19:21.967 --> 19:24.600
I want to apologize
for depending on you so much.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.933
I'm proud of you
for stepping up, but, um...

19:28.933 --> 19:31.400
I got the big stuff from now on.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.567
And...

19:33.633 --> 19:35.533
I want you to take a night off.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.700
A night off?

19:36.767 --> 19:37.700
What's that?

19:38.733 --> 19:39.700
Go.

19:40.733 --> 19:41.900
Go.

19:44.633 --> 19:45.700
Good luck.

19:51.167 --> 19:53.500
Your mother
always used to say,

19:53.567 --> 19:56.867
those who are happiest
are those who help others.

19:56.933 --> 19:58.933
And we help each other
in this family.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.533
That means
we don't pass the buck--

20:00.600 --> 20:01.933
or sponge--- to someone

20:02.000 --> 20:03.667
when it's our responsibility,
our duty.

20:05.167 --> 20:07.500
We've gotta learn
to do things ourselves.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.933
Now, we've all
abandoned ship here,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.700
except Elisa.

20:13.033 --> 20:15.400
I had a meeting
with her teacher today,

20:15.467 --> 20:19.433
and... she's been
falling asleep in school.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.600
But school's
the best part of the day!

20:22.833 --> 20:23.767
The reason why
she's been so stressed

20:23.833 --> 20:25.133
and falling behind

20:25.200 --> 20:28.500
is because she's running
this entire house herself.

20:28.567 --> 20:29.867
Now, I'll be the first
to admit it,

20:29.933 --> 20:32.433
I-I've let things go,

20:32.500 --> 20:34.700
and as captain of this team,

20:34.767 --> 20:37.067
I need to keep our dugout
in order.

20:38.033 --> 20:40.433
I just assumed she liked
folding my clothes.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.267
She color coordinates
everything.

20:43.333 --> 20:46.567
She even Windexed my poster
of the periodic table.

20:46.633 --> 20:48.633
I just figured she was
learning while cleaning.

20:48.700 --> 20:49.800
In a way, I was helping her.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.533
Let's surprise Elisa
and clean up.

20:57.133 --> 20:58.133
What do you say, girls?

20:58.200 --> 21:01.567
In sisterhood,
we stand!

21:02.800 --> 21:04.567
In sister...hood, yeah!

21:48.567 --> 21:50.833
You can count on me

21:54.167 --> 21:55.067
This isn't
so bad actually.

21:55.133 --> 21:56.800
Yeah.

21:58.267 --> 22:00.067
Look, it's
so moisturizing.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.567
Nice.

22:01.633 --> 22:02.933
I feel bad about Elisa.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.633
Me too.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.800
At least we're helping out
now, though, right?

22:06.867 --> 22:08.333
Better late
than never.

22:22.067 --> 22:24.633
I could totally work
at the Genius Bar.

22:34.133 --> 22:35.600
Whoa...

22:35.667 --> 22:37.700
Is this the same house?

22:37.767 --> 22:39.933
We thought we'd surprise you.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.333
Thanks, guys!

22:41.400 --> 22:42.833
And I'm getting
dinner tonight.

22:50.867 --> 22:53.133
Tomorrow, I'll cook us
a real meal, I promise.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.133
Seriously, this is nice.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.067
Who clued you in
that I needed some help?

22:59.333 --> 23:00.833
It was your teacher, Lori.

23:00.900 --> 23:01.833
Miss Addison?

23:01.900 --> 23:03.267
She's nice.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.900
I fell asleep in class, and...

23:04.967 --> 23:06.700
Yeah, she told me.

23:06.767 --> 23:08.367
I think
she's nice, too.

23:08.433 --> 23:10.233
We're going out
for a drink later.

23:12.467 --> 23:14.200
Whoa, Papi's got
some game.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.167
I love a learned woman.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.267
I'm going to go
finish my homework.

23:19.333 --> 23:20.733
Okay.

23:23.300 --> 23:24.933
See, Papi?

23:25.067 --> 23:28.067
Elisa needed help,
and now we're helping.

23:29.133 --> 23:30.667
What are you getting at?

23:30.733 --> 23:32.100
A foreign concept
to the male brain,

23:32.167 --> 23:34.067
refusing to ask
for directions,

23:34.100 --> 23:37.067
or help with
parallel parking, or...

23:37.067 --> 23:39.600
calling
a cleaning service?

24:01.867 --> 24:04.100
Elisa's teacher?

24:04.167 --> 24:05.100
Oh, please,
not you, too.

24:05.167 --> 24:06.733
Dude...

24:06.800 --> 24:08.767
I mean, I get it,
I was a boy,

24:08.833 --> 24:11.133
and when you're a boy,
you like your hot teacher,

24:11.200 --> 24:12.200
that makes sense.

24:12.267 --> 24:13.767
I remember Mrs. Ward,

24:13.833 --> 24:15.767
she was like
Cindy Crawford,

24:15.833 --> 24:16.767
exactly.

24:16.833 --> 24:17.667
Really?

24:17.733 --> 24:18.867
No.

24:18.933 --> 24:19.800
But...

24:19.867 --> 24:20.833
that's in retrospect,

24:20.900 --> 24:21.900
and at the time,

24:21.967 --> 24:24.633
I thought they were twins.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.100
You can't date
the teacher, dude.

24:26.167 --> 24:28.067
That's not a good idea.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.667
It's one date,

24:29.733 --> 24:30.433
one drink.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.667
I'm not gonna marry her.

24:31.733 --> 24:32.967
Definitely
don't marry her.

24:33.067 --> 24:33.800
Marry who?

24:33.867 --> 24:35.733
Me. Don't marry me.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.400
She's definitely not
going to marry me,

24:37.467 --> 24:39.100
so I'm definitely not
going to marry her.

24:39.167 --> 24:40.800
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:40.867 --> 24:41.800
That's terrible.

24:41.867 --> 24:42.833
Did you just ask her?

24:43.967 --> 24:44.900
Last week.

24:47.133 --> 24:48.933
And she just, uh, shut me down.

24:51.767 --> 24:53.900
That sucks.

24:53.967 --> 24:54.733
Yup.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.267
Yup, it's hard out there.

24:56.333 --> 24:58.167
It must be really tough
for you, huh?

24:58.233 --> 24:59.467
After everything
you've been through?

24:59.533 --> 25:03.333
Well, there's been a lot
of figuring out as we go.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.800
Hmm, I can't imagine.

25:04.867 --> 25:07.367
I've got to say,
it's okay, you know?

25:07.433 --> 25:08.667
I mean, except here and there,

25:08.733 --> 25:10.800
and the, uh, falling asleep
in school bit.

25:10.867 --> 25:11.933
Right.

25:12.067 --> 25:14.367
I mean, three girls,
that's a lot.

25:14.433 --> 25:15.733
I know,

25:15.800 --> 25:16.967
I'm like Superman.

25:17.067 --> 25:18.767
Minus
the cape, I hope?

25:18.833 --> 25:20.267
No, no, I still
have the cape.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.433
I only wear it
on special occasions.

25:24.067 --> 25:26.367
So, how long

25:26.433 --> 25:27.800
have you
been teaching?

25:27.867 --> 25:31.400
About
five years now.

25:31.467 --> 25:33.133
I really like
this school.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.933
Well, in a few years,

25:35.067 --> 25:36.067
you're going to get
my youngest, Gigi.

25:36.067 --> 25:37.233
And what's she like?

25:37.300 --> 25:38.633
Well, let's just say,

25:38.700 --> 25:40.367
as long as you're up
on your major philosophers,

25:40.433 --> 25:42.800
Greek and Roman history,
women's issues,

25:42.867 --> 25:44.167
and basically
all of American Literature,

25:44.233 --> 25:45.400
you'll be fine.

25:45.467 --> 25:46.800
Oh, boy.

25:46.867 --> 25:48.067
Oh, yeah, she's gonna
keep you on your toes.

25:48.133 --> 25:49.767
Um, do you want
to get some...

25:50.867 --> 25:51.933
...f-food?

25:52.067 --> 25:54.867
M-maybe, uh, get a table
in the back?

25:56.833 --> 25:58.700
Yeah, certainly,
I can do that.

26:01.067 --> 26:02.333
Cheers.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.367
Cheers.

26:15.167 --> 26:16.100
Hey, girl.

26:16.167 --> 26:17.100
We have a little surprise
for you.

26:17.167 --> 26:18.933
-Come on.
-What?

26:19.967 --> 26:20.867
Come on.

26:22.967 --> 26:23.933
What's going on?

26:24.067 --> 26:25.133
TeePee time!

26:26.233 --> 26:28.100
Oh, my gosh...

26:29.067 --> 26:30.133
Isn't this awesome?

26:30.200 --> 26:31.967
We built it for you.

26:32.067 --> 26:34.433
Thanks, you guys,
this is great.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.833
We wanted to say
we're sorry.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.500
Our most sincere
apologies.

26:38.567 --> 26:40.967
We never meant to put
everything on you.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.533
If you're ever overwhelmed,
you can always come to us.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.333
I might just
take you up on that.

26:47.400 --> 26:50.067
To sisters
in sanitation.

26:50.100 --> 26:51.167
Boop!

26:53.567 --> 26:56.100
It's been so long
since we've hung out in here.

26:56.167 --> 26:56.900
Remember
when you and Dad

26:56.967 --> 26:58.367
put up the treehouse?

26:58.433 --> 27:00.967
And Dad bashed
his thumbnail with a hammer

27:01.067 --> 27:02.500
so hard it turned black.

27:02.567 --> 27:04.067
And Mirabel put nail polish
on it when he was sleeping.

27:04.067 --> 27:05.933
I was just trying to help.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.300
Hey, Rosa, it's Richard.

27:16.367 --> 27:18.933
If you're free this weekend,
I'd love to take you to
Aspen...

27:19.067 --> 27:20.433
Not in the mood for Aspen.

27:22.567 --> 27:25.367
Ciao, Rosa, lo vengo
negli Stati Uniti domani.

27:25.433 --> 27:28.067
Sarebbe bello vederti, amore.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.967
No, grazie.

27:30.067 --> 27:33.400
Abuela? It's me.

27:33.467 --> 27:35.533
Things have gotten crazy
since you left...

27:35.600 --> 27:38.567
Please call me.

27:43.167 --> 27:47.233
Sweet, glorious
air conditioning.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.300
Enjoying yourself?

27:49.367 --> 27:50.567
Oh, you have
no idea.

27:50.633 --> 27:52.400
How did you fix it?

27:52.467 --> 27:55.433
I had a moment of clarity
and, um...

27:55.500 --> 27:56.467
hired someone.

27:56.533 --> 27:58.233
Mm...

27:58.300 --> 28:01.067
Everything's
peaceful again.

28:01.133 --> 28:02.300
Ricky Cooper!

28:02.367 --> 28:04.367
I'm gonna go take
a Yoga class.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.367
Bye.

28:06.667 --> 28:08.267
I get a call
from my granddaughter,

28:08.333 --> 28:12.067
telling me that she's doing
everything that I used to do!

28:12.067 --> 28:14.233
Now, what kind of a man
doesn't roll up his sleeves

28:14.300 --> 28:16.167
and start cleaning?

28:16.233 --> 28:17.167
Trust me, I know.

28:17.233 --> 28:18.600
I have such doubts.

28:18.667 --> 28:21.333
I don't know if I did
the right thing by leaving.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.067
Of course you did.

28:23.133 --> 28:23.967
We're managing.

28:25.233 --> 28:26.933
It-it's just that I...

28:27.067 --> 28:28.500
I miss Isabella every day,

28:28.567 --> 28:30.900
and I-I loved being with
my girls all the time,

28:30.967 --> 28:33.267
and now, I just feel...

28:33.333 --> 28:34.300
alone and cast aside.

28:36.067 --> 28:38.067
When you left,
it was really hard.

28:38.067 --> 28:39.567
Oh?

28:39.633 --> 28:40.700
How hard?

28:40.767 --> 28:43.500
The house
looked like a war zone.

28:43.567 --> 28:44.933
I thought I could do it.

28:45.067 --> 28:46.167
I thought
I could handle everything,

28:46.233 --> 28:47.967
and that the girls
would help out,

28:48.067 --> 28:50.133
and I found out that,
well, it...

28:51.300 --> 28:52.367
It wasn't so easy.

28:53.533 --> 28:54.633
Without the center,

28:54.700 --> 28:57.333
things fall apart,

28:57.400 --> 28:58.567
and you...

28:58.633 --> 29:00.267
are our center.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.267
Oh...

29:02.333 --> 29:04.367
I only left because it was time,

29:04.433 --> 29:05.600
and you can do this.

29:05.667 --> 29:07.067
You just need help.

29:07.133 --> 29:09.233
You and the girls can do this,

29:09.300 --> 29:10.600
and will be stronger for it.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.100
We have to learn to manage,
but, um...

29:15.267 --> 29:17.633
we'll always need you.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.533
Oh...

29:19.600 --> 29:21.067
Thank you.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.433
I needed to hear that.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.133
And I'll always need you
and my girls.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.667
I knew

29:26.733 --> 29:29.400
the first moment
my daughter brought you home

29:29.467 --> 29:31.233
that you were the one.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.067
You're a good man, Ricky Cooper.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.567
But not great.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.533
I went by the house,

29:39.600 --> 29:41.367
and, uh...

29:41.433 --> 29:44.233
Elisa forgot her lunch.

29:49.567 --> 29:50.700
Aw...

29:59.667 --> 30:01.133
I don't know--

30:01.200 --> 30:02.533
Hey, Elisa,

30:02.600 --> 30:04.567
is your Dad really dating
Miss Addison?

30:05.767 --> 30:07.433
Why are you asking me this?

30:07.500 --> 30:09.567
I heard it from Girl Sam,
who heard it from Boy Sam,

30:09.633 --> 30:10.533
who heard it
from the girl with the cast,

30:10.600 --> 30:12.333
who heard it from your sister.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.667
The year is 1607,

30:20.733 --> 30:22.367
and the first colony
was founded

30:22.433 --> 30:24.433
in Jamestown, Virginia.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.367
With the help from...

30:27.433 --> 30:31.600
Come on, can anyone tell me
who helped the colonists?

30:31.667 --> 30:32.733
Elisa?

30:32.800 --> 30:34.600
The Native American
Powahatans,

30:34.667 --> 30:36.033
but if you ask me,

30:36.100 --> 30:37.167
the settlers should have stayed
in their own lands

30:37.233 --> 30:39.400
and left the Powahatans alone.

30:42.167 --> 30:44.367
Sorry to interrupt.

30:44.433 --> 30:46.100
Not at all, come in.

30:46.167 --> 30:47.700
Uh...

30:47.767 --> 30:49.300
Elisa forgot her lunch.

30:50.767 --> 30:52.100
That was nice
of you to bring it.

30:53.533 --> 30:56.033
Trying to be better.

30:56.100 --> 30:57.267
Thanks for your help.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.633
You're welcome.

31:06.700 --> 31:07.800
Sarah...

31:07.867 --> 31:10.700
top of Page Four
for me, would you?

31:22.633 --> 31:26.200
...46, 47, 48, 49...

31:26.267 --> 31:27.500
Ooh...

31:27.567 --> 31:29.567
Only 50?

31:31.167 --> 31:32.533
Must be
all the takeout.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.200
So, um,
any new dates?

31:35.267 --> 31:36.433
Well, you could say

31:36.500 --> 31:38.967
I have some
after-school activities.

31:39.067 --> 31:40.300
Oh?

31:40.367 --> 31:41.633
Well, I just met her,
but she seems great.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.167
You know, smart, cool,
cares about the girls.

31:44.233 --> 31:45.733
Wow, she's already
met the girls?

31:45.800 --> 31:46.767
Well, she's
Elisa's teacher.

31:46.833 --> 31:48.100
Whoa, whoa.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.267
You're dating Elisa's teacher?

31:50.333 --> 31:53.067
Well, I mean, it was one date.

31:53.133 --> 31:54.700
If my Dad
dated one of my teachers,

31:54.767 --> 31:56.500
I would throw up,

31:56.567 --> 31:57.567
or drop out.

31:58.533 --> 31:59.767
No way.

31:59.833 --> 32:01.633
No, if it bothered Elisa,
she would've said so.

32:04.333 --> 32:06.267
I think...

32:08.633 --> 32:10.733
That man
is completely clueless.

32:14.833 --> 32:16.300
Why'd you have to tell
the whole school

32:16.367 --> 32:17.567
about Dad and Miss Addison?

32:17.633 --> 32:19.333
I told one person.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.633
Who told one person...

32:20.700 --> 32:22.267
who told one more person.

32:22.333 --> 32:24.600
You shouldn't have
said anything!

32:24.667 --> 32:26.500
We need a sister talk.

32:26.567 --> 32:28.533
She's...

32:28.600 --> 32:31.067
actually studying.

32:32.567 --> 32:34.333
It's like we're on safari.

32:34.400 --> 32:35.833
Please.

32:35.900 --> 32:38.633
These are
personalized autographs.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.167
Liam made them.

32:41.233 --> 32:43.633
They're prizes people win
for following me.

32:43.700 --> 32:46.067
Is framing
included?

32:50.567 --> 32:52.100
We need to talk.

32:52.167 --> 32:53.467
I'm freaking out.

32:53.533 --> 32:54.900
You know how you said
I could come to you

32:54.967 --> 32:56.733
if I was ever feeling
overwhelmed?

32:57.700 --> 32:58.567
What's up?

32:58.633 --> 33:00.600
I thought about it,

33:00.667 --> 33:03.133
and I don't want Dad
to date Miss Addison.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.633
It's too weird.

33:04.700 --> 33:07.433
Today at school, everyone
was talking about me.

33:07.500 --> 33:10.100
You're thinking
about it all wrong.

33:10.167 --> 33:12.600
Capitalize on that fame.

33:12.667 --> 33:15.233
Since when do you know words
like "capitalize"?

33:15.300 --> 33:17.600
Since Liam started
a donate button on my page.

33:17.667 --> 33:18.567
Can we get back to me?

33:18.633 --> 33:20.600
Okay.

33:20.667 --> 33:23.567
Look, nothing bad
can come from this.

33:23.633 --> 33:25.600
If Dad's dating Miss Addison,

33:25.667 --> 33:27.700
you're guaranteed
at least a "B".

33:28.800 --> 33:29.733
Hey...

33:31.867 --> 33:34.667
Those are not
happy faces.

33:34.733 --> 33:35.667
Everything okay?

33:35.733 --> 33:36.667
Yes.

33:40.867 --> 33:43.267
Is this about me dropping off
your lunch at school?

33:43.333 --> 33:44.733
No.

33:46.333 --> 33:48.900
Is this about me
going out with Lori?

33:48.967 --> 33:51.333
Her name is
Miss Addison!

33:52.367 --> 33:54.300
And, yes, this is about
you going out with her.

33:54.367 --> 33:56.767
Okay. Okay, lemme have it.

33:56.833 --> 33:59.500
I tried to get used to
the idea of you dating her,

33:59.567 --> 34:00.600
but I just can't!

34:00.667 --> 34:01.900
It's just...

34:01.967 --> 34:03.200
Icky.

34:07.933 --> 34:09.700
I'm sorry, Dad.

34:09.767 --> 34:11.367
It's just the way I feel.

34:11.433 --> 34:13.500
"Icky" will not be
on your SATs.

34:13.567 --> 34:14.500
Shh.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.067
I understand.

34:17.867 --> 34:19.800
You know I want you
to be happy, right?

34:20.933 --> 34:22.267
Hel-lo?

34:38.433 --> 34:39.567
Hi.

34:39.633 --> 34:40.933
Hey.

34:41.633 --> 34:46.433
So, um, I needed another
parent-teacher conference.

34:46.500 --> 34:47.567
For me.

34:47.633 --> 34:49.867
Mm-hmm?

34:51.733 --> 34:55.833
I think us seeing each other
is a bit much for Elisa.

34:57.667 --> 34:59.500
This whole dating thing
is new to me,

34:59.567 --> 35:03.367
and I need my girls
to feel comfortable.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.500
I get it.

35:06.567 --> 35:07.733
You're a good dad, Ricky.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.300
Those girls are so lucky.

35:10.367 --> 35:11.333
No.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.667
I'm the lucky one.

35:13.733 --> 35:16.367
Thanks for understanding.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.667
Well, thanks for stopping by.

35:20.733 --> 35:21.900
Yeah.

35:25.167 --> 35:26.700
Okay, then, I'm...

35:26.767 --> 35:27.800
I'm gonna go.

35:28.933 --> 35:29.933
Uh, Ricky?

35:30.067 --> 35:31.467
Mr. Cooper?

35:31.533 --> 35:32.833
Yeah?

35:32.900 --> 35:37.333
The school year ends soon,

35:37.400 --> 35:38.533
and as you know,
Elisa's graduating.

35:39.900 --> 35:42.533
My thoughts exactly.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.567
Bye.

35:43.633 --> 35:44.567
Bye.

36:11.567 --> 36:12.833
Hey.

36:12.900 --> 36:13.867
Hey.

36:13.933 --> 36:15.933
Wow, what a day.

36:16.067 --> 36:18.633
Elisa didn't throw up,
but she might as well have.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.600
She was seriously
upset with me.

36:20.667 --> 36:22.600
She looked like she was
on the verge of dropping out.

36:22.667 --> 36:23.800
You were right.

36:23.867 --> 36:26.467
Having second thoughts
on the teacher?

36:26.533 --> 36:29.833
I should get an "F" in Dating.

36:29.900 --> 36:32.067
You and me both.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.233
It's a long road ahead,

36:34.300 --> 36:36.100
you know, with dating,
with the girls,

36:36.167 --> 36:37.267
with everything.

36:37.333 --> 36:39.767
I'm glad
you're my friend, Steph.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.933
I'll talk to you later.

36:59.067 --> 37:00.633
Yo!

37:02.067 --> 37:04.500
There's no ice cream, Todd.

37:04.567 --> 37:07.133
Not here
about the ice cream, bro.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.067
Tell me everything.

37:10.133 --> 37:11.767
Did you get
detention?

37:11.833 --> 37:13.567
I called it quits
with the teacher.

37:13.633 --> 37:15.067
I'm so destroyed.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.600
I'm sorry, dude.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.667
I know you were banking
on this one.

37:19.833 --> 37:20.933
I need to be alone now.

37:21.067 --> 37:22.267
Okay.

37:22.333 --> 37:24.500
Wait, are those
gluten-free Pretzels?

37:24.567 --> 37:25.633
I can eat those.

37:32.533 --> 37:33.600
Mm...

37:33.667 --> 37:34.533
I feel better already.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.567
Thank you.

37:35.633 --> 37:36.800
Y-y-you're taking...

37:36.867 --> 37:37.800
you're taking them.

37:37.867 --> 37:38.933
Okay.

37:39.067 --> 37:40.067
All right.

37:59.067 --> 38:00.533
All right, girls,
we need to talk.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.267
Not text, read, or sulk.

38:06.067 --> 38:09.067
I want you to know
that I won't be dating Lor--

38:09.100 --> 38:10.267
Miss Addison.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.633
It's my fault, isn't it?

38:13.633 --> 38:15.100
Don't ever think that.

38:16.100 --> 38:17.267
All right, if any of you
feel a certain way

38:17.333 --> 38:18.633
about someone I date,

38:18.700 --> 38:20.067
I want you to come to me,
and we'll talk it out.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.233
Thanks, Dad.

38:23.300 --> 38:24.767
Your happiness
is everything to me.

38:24.833 --> 38:25.767
Come here.

38:29.567 --> 38:31.300
Aw...

38:32.133 --> 38:34.067
And I thought
I'd cook us dinner tonight.

38:36.767 --> 38:38.767
Abuela's coming, too.

38:51.800 --> 38:52.933
It's really good

38:53.067 --> 38:54.533
to see you in the kitchen
again, Abuela.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.700
Thank you.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.100
I'm sorry I missed
your call, Elisa.

38:57.167 --> 38:59.300
I'll do better
next time.

38:59.367 --> 39:00.967
And I can't believe
how much I missed!

39:01.067 --> 39:02.800
Well,
my followers

39:02.867 --> 39:04.233
seem to have
flatlined.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.400
Aw...

39:05.467 --> 39:07.300
-I'm a Marxist Feminist now.
-Oh.

39:07.367 --> 39:08.600
"Si se puede!"

39:10.667 --> 39:11.667
Let's do dinner

39:11.733 --> 39:12.967
at least once a week
together.

39:13.067 --> 39:13.833
I can dig it, chica.

39:13.900 --> 39:14.767
And I'll send you

39:14.833 --> 39:16.067
a daily status report.

39:16.133 --> 39:18.133
Well, I love that
even more.

39:18.967 --> 39:20.900
This is so much better
than delivery.

39:20.967 --> 39:23.100
Mm-hmm.

39:23.167 --> 39:25.167
And guess who will
be here tomorrow?

39:26.300 --> 39:27.867
Merry Maids!

39:27.933 --> 39:29.333
Yeah, they'll be
coming once a week

39:29.400 --> 39:30.700
just to help out
with the big stuff,

39:30.767 --> 39:31.967
but that still means

39:32.067 --> 39:33.800
you girls need
to keep your rooms clean

39:33.867 --> 39:35.300
and help out.

39:35.367 --> 39:36.300
Well, well,

39:36.367 --> 39:38.067
the great man
asked for help.

39:38.067 --> 39:39.867
I'm proud of you, Dad.

39:39.933 --> 39:41.967
Aw, thanks.

39:42.067 --> 39:43.333
We sure did miss
your cooking, Abuela.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.067
Mm-hmm, and your
grocery shopping.

39:46.133 --> 39:47.800
And I think your dad

39:47.867 --> 39:50.267
did a super good job this time.

39:50.333 --> 39:52.667
No, you actually wouldn't
believe my first try.

39:52.733 --> 39:54.167
It was crazy.

39:54.233 --> 39:55.967
So, I'm walking over
to the cheese section,

39:56.067 --> 39:57.367
because I couldn't help myself,

39:57.433 --> 40:00.333
then I realize,
it's not real cheese,

40:00.400 --> 40:03.400
it's like a soy tofu cheese.

40:03.467 --> 40:05.233
Yeah, and you know
what else they make?

40:05.300 --> 40:07.333
Fake bacon,
veggie bacon.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.933
Yeah, I mean, who knows
what it tastes like--

40:09.000 --> 40:10.100
Fac-on?

40:10.167 --> 40:11.700
Sorta like a--
"Facon!"

40:11.767 --> 40:13.000
That's my girl
right there...

40:51.300 --> 40:53.100
Still up?

40:53.167 --> 40:55.600
I've got my re-test tomorrow.

40:57.467 --> 41:01.833
This Powahatan history stuff
is actually pretty fascinating.

41:01.900 --> 41:03.767
Speaking
of history...

41:05.500 --> 41:08.767
This is the first ring
I ever gave your mother.

41:11.500 --> 41:14.967
I want you to have it.

41:15.067 --> 41:17.067
Oh, Dad...

41:19.167 --> 41:22.733
And I want
to apologize again

41:22.800 --> 41:25.333
for depending on you so much.

41:27.067 --> 41:28.833
The way you take care
of everything,

41:28.900 --> 41:30.067
handle the house,

41:30.067 --> 41:31.733
you're just like your mother.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.800
You've got her spirit.

41:39.367 --> 41:40.433
I love you.

41:43.233 --> 41:45.133
I love you, too.

41:50.733 --> 41:53.067
And, um...

41:53.067 --> 41:56.300
no cleaning up
after Merry Maids, deal?

41:56.367 --> 41:58.067
No?

41:58.067 --> 41:59.067
No.
