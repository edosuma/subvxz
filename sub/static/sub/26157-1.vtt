- SEAL team 2, five clicks out
approaching perimeter, over.

01:31.482 --> 01:35.051
- Sweep the area
and proceed with caution.

01:37.184 --> 01:40.404
- Sat Com to Two Actual. Tread
lightly and check six. Over.

01:40.404 --> 01:43.364
- All right guys,
clear perimeter.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.368
- Clear.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.805
- Move!

01:59.249 --> 02:00.946
- SATCOM, this is 2 Actual.

02:00.946 --> 02:04.341
We have visual on impact site.

02:06.169 --> 02:08.084
Any time we'’ll be back
and forth with the intel.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.824
- Roger that, 2 actual. Over.

02:09.824 --> 02:12.132
- Keep your heads on a swivel.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.177
- Things are gonna get hairy.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.397
- Ah don'’t soil you diaper,
I got your six.

02:16.397 --> 02:19.443
- Copy that.
Let'’s move on.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.705

02:43.206 --> 02:44.903

We'’re going silent. Copy?

03:32.081 --> 03:33.517
- Roger that, 2 actual.

03:33.517 --> 03:34.823
- Over and out.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.521
- All right. Let'’s go.

03:45.355 --> 03:48.228
Incoming fire! Take cover!

03:52.449 --> 03:54.059
- SATCOM!

03:54.059 --> 03:56.105
- Unit 2, this is SATCOM.
I--I read you.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.325
What the hell is going on?

03:59.978 --> 04:01.980
- Watch your back,
watch your back!

04:01.980 --> 04:03.895
- What do you see?

04:03.895 --> 04:04.809
- Unit 2, this is SATCOM--
what'’s happening? Over.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.554
- SATCOM!
We'’re under fire!

04:14.254 --> 04:15.994
- Man down! Man down!

04:19.389 --> 04:20.521
- Firing!

04:26.004 --> 04:28.485
- Unit 2, this is SATCOM.
What are you seeing? Over.

04:30.095 --> 04:33.316
- Ahhhh!

04:33.316 --> 04:36.450
Ahhhh!

04:39.061 --> 04:40.584
- SATCOM, this is unit 2--

04:40.584 --> 04:42.891
we'’re taking heavy fire
from unseen insurgents.

04:42.891 --> 04:45.894
We need backup ASAP!
Do you copy?

04:45.894 --> 04:49.027
- Unit 2, do you read me?
What'’s your 20? Over.

04:49.027 --> 04:52.292
- SATCOM, do you copy?
We need to retreat!

04:52.292 --> 04:53.336
- This is SATCOM-- I read you.

04:53.336 --> 04:56.687
Do you hear me? Over.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.734
Unit 2--again,
this is SATCOM. Over.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.866
Shit.

05:05.696 --> 05:06.784
- Lieutenant Colonel Adrian.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.917
- Brooks. What'’s going on?

05:08.917 --> 05:11.136
- I was working SATCOM
support for unit 2, and--

05:11.136 --> 05:12.703
- The recon mission
on the crashed bird?

05:12.703 --> 05:14.792
- Yes, sir.
They moved in radio silent,

05:14.792 --> 05:16.359
and about one minute later
I received communication

05:16.359 --> 05:18.796
that they were under fire.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.972
SATCOM went dead about 30,
40 seconds ago.

05:20.972 --> 05:24.367
I wasn'’t able to hail anyone.
Uh-uh...

05:24.367 --> 05:25.847
- What? What, what,
what, what, what?

05:25.847 --> 05:27.239
- The body scan
is a negative, sir.

05:27.239 --> 05:31.548
They'’re all down.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.724
- Come on. Show me.

05:38.903 --> 05:43.168
- All their body monitors
are dead, except for Hobbs.

05:47.521 --> 05:48.826
- This was the last message
that came through?

05:48.826 --> 05:53.614
Yes, sir, at 10:17.

05:53.614 --> 05:57.444
- It'’s gonna be a long day.
Long day...

06:09.804 --> 06:13.024
- Sir.

06:13.024 --> 06:16.071
- Adrian, what can
I help you with?

06:16.071 --> 06:18.160
- Unit 2 is now down.
They'’re offline.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.770
- Oh, jeez.

06:19.770 --> 06:24.688
I was worried this
was gonna go sideways.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.298
Well, that'’s unfortunate,

06:26.298 --> 06:28.388
but we'’re just gonna
have to sit it out

06:28.388 --> 06:30.738
until our second unit SEAL team

06:30.738 --> 06:32.304
goes in for its scheduled recon.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.784
- Sir, with all due respect,

06:33.784 --> 06:35.438
they'’re not gonna
be there for five hours.

06:35.438 --> 06:38.659
- Look, I am aware of that,
Lieutenant Colonel.

06:38.659 --> 06:41.705
- Sir, intel tells us insurgents
regularly patrol that area.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.141
- What do you propose we do?

06:43.141 --> 06:44.708
- I propose that we
send a chopper, sir,

06:44.708 --> 06:47.494
to scan for survivors.
It'’ll only take about--

06:47.494 --> 06:49.931
- Look, Lieutenant
Colonel Adrian,

06:49.931 --> 06:54.849
you know that that area
is a strict no-fly zone.

06:54.849 --> 06:57.417
I mean, we'’re as close
to enemy lines

06:57.417 --> 06:59.549
as we could legally be
at this second.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.725
- We can arrange for a fly-by.

07:01.725 --> 07:02.813
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa--
I'’m sorry, soldier.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.075
We can'’t risk it politically.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.729
- Permission requested--

07:05.729 --> 07:07.514
- Now let me tell you something,
I am not gonna explain

07:07.514 --> 07:11.474
how we managed to get a chopper
shot down behind enemy lines.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.215
- Permission to request
to put together a team.

07:13.215 --> 07:16.566
I just need five
or seven good men--

07:16.566 --> 07:18.307
I'’ve got men out there
that I trust with my life.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.352
- All right, listen to me.
- Just give me--

07:20.352 --> 07:22.833
- Lieutenant Colonel, listen.

07:22.833 --> 07:26.707
Unit 2 is an elite
black-ops SEAL team.

07:26.707 --> 07:29.013
It'’s the best we have
in-country.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.581
Now, I--I understand
you'’re no stranger

07:31.581 --> 07:34.236
to black-ops missions, okay?

07:34.236 --> 07:36.934
But the men in this company
are enlisted.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.893
- Sir, there'’s men in the--
- No, no--enlisted.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.416
- Sir, there'’s men--
- Rank and file.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.418
Now you are gonna wait,
like the rest of us,

07:42.418 --> 07:46.727
for that recon team
in five hours.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.338
Is there anything else you need,
Lieutenant Colonel?

07:54.430 --> 07:55.605
Dismissed.

08:04.005 --> 08:07.661
- Carter.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.275
If I was to ask you to go AWOL
to go get unit 2--

08:13.275 --> 08:15.364
- You give the word, Cap,
I'’m there.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.541
I'’m not about to let those men
die out there alone.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.238
- We need to go ASAP.
- Got it.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.414
- Be sure that you make Brooks
part of the team.

08:22.414 --> 08:24.155
- Paul Brooks?

08:24.155 --> 08:25.940
- Yes, we need a tech.
- But he was moved to SATCOM--

08:25.940 --> 08:27.028
- We don'’t have a choice.

08:27.028 --> 08:28.856
I know the story, okay?

08:28.856 --> 08:30.510
I get it. I understand.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.250
But I also know he'’s ready
to go back inside.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.774
Any other guys you want?

08:33.774 --> 08:37.125
- No, sir.
- No? All right.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.169
- Of course, Cap.
To hell and back.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.789
- First off,
thank y'’all for being here.

08:48.789 --> 08:52.488
What I'’m about to tell you
does not leave this tent.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.577
Now of course,
I trust you all,

08:54.577 --> 08:56.753
but what I'’m gonna say
is highly unsanctioned,

08:56.753 --> 09:00.017
with court martial potential.

09:00.017 --> 09:03.194
This morning, unit 2
went out on recon.

09:03.194 --> 09:07.416
They are now dark.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.374
The colonel'’s made
it crystal clear

09:09.374 --> 09:14.162
he'’s not gonna authorize any
backup for any rescue mission.

09:14.162 --> 09:16.077
You all know those SEALs.

09:16.077 --> 09:20.429
And Hobbs'’ life support monitor
is still reading a heartbeat.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.300
Which is why I'’ll be damned

09:22.300 --> 09:23.606
if I leave them out there
high and dry.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.522
- Exactly what are you
proposing, sir?

09:26.522 --> 09:28.959
- I'’m proposing that we
hump it to them--right now.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.048
Right now.

09:31.048 --> 09:34.225
They need help, like, yesterday
and no ones gonna help in time.

09:34.225 --> 09:38.795
Now, I--I--I realize
what I'’m asking you.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.928
I get it.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.931
Most of you have ran with me
on these missions before,

09:43.931 --> 09:47.587
so you know I expect you all
to come back with me.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.414
But you might not.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.242
- These guys are aren'’t
a special op team.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.244
We'’re not even a unit.

09:53.244 --> 09:56.987
- We'’re not, but we'’re the best
damn chance they got right now.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.902
I hope that'’s enough.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.821
- There'’s no option.

10:04.821 --> 10:07.476
It'’s the right thing
to do, guys.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.869
I'’m with you, Cap.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.697
- I'’m in.

10:10.697 --> 10:11.828
- You all in?

10:11.828 --> 10:14.178
- Sir, yes, sir.

10:16.528 --> 10:19.836
- All right. Grab your gear.
We'’re gonna push in 30 minutes.

10:31.369 --> 10:36.244
♪

11:08.711 --> 11:10.670
- Yeah, yeah,
I don'’t wanna hear it.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.584
- All the ladies always
gotta stick together.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.065
- You broads
on the same cycle yet?

11:15.065 --> 11:17.328
- We'’ve heard it all
a million times.

11:17.328 --> 11:20.244
- I don'’t know why y'’all being
so defensive about it.

11:20.244 --> 11:23.073
Carter and I have been on the
same cycle for three years now.

11:23.073 --> 11:26.163
- Because y'’all got low T.

11:26.163 --> 11:29.166
- Yeah, that'’s right, sugar--
I got the lowest T around.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.081
Might as well put me in Guinness
Book of World Records

11:31.081 --> 11:33.257
for testosterone deficiency.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.520
- Don'’t worry, Pete.
One day, a girl

11:35.520 --> 11:38.219
will actually like you despite
your personality.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.351
- Oh, thanks, Mom.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.266
- Will you all quit
yammering back there?

11:42.266 --> 11:45.617
- Oh, Carter, don'’t even get me
started on that guy.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.663
That guy'’s got so much T,

11:47.663 --> 11:50.492
might as well call him Mr. T.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.015
- Damn right they do.

11:52.015 --> 11:55.758
- Let them know, Carter.

11:55.758 --> 11:58.108
How you doing back there,
Brooks?

11:58.108 --> 11:59.936
- I'’m good, Plante,
I'’m doing fine.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.503
- Well, you look like crap.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.940
You nervous about
being on duty again?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.594
- Nope. Why, are you?

12:05.594 --> 12:08.379
- Psh, no, man.
I was born for this.

12:08.379 --> 12:12.209
- Look, we all
been stuck in SATCOM,

12:12.209 --> 12:13.341
spent some time
out of action.

12:13.341 --> 12:16.736
But you?
You belong there.

12:16.736 --> 12:20.174
We all know about
your little problem.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.915
- Plante, why--why are you
still talking to this spaz?

12:21.915 --> 12:25.048
- Just killing time, baby.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.789
- You that hard up
for entertainment,

12:26.789 --> 12:28.269
you gotta go
and pester Brooks?

12:28.269 --> 12:30.010
- Oh, yeah.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.534
- Sklaroff, you heard about
what Brooks did at the PX?

12:32.534 --> 12:35.015
- Yeah, man.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.668
I heard he was
wigging the hell out

12:36.668 --> 12:38.801
just trying to buy
a candy bar or something.

12:38.801 --> 12:41.891
- It'’s bad enough
that the man spazzes up

12:41.891 --> 12:45.286
every time he throws
a fit in combat.

12:45.286 --> 12:49.725
But when we'’re chilling?
What'’s that about, huh?

12:49.725 --> 12:51.509
- You'’ve had PTSD
training, right?

12:51.509 --> 12:52.554
- Yeah.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.556
- I--I get anxiety attacks.

12:54.556 --> 12:57.864
I can'’t control
when they happen, man.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.604
Sneak up on you sometimes.

12:59.604 --> 13:03.260
- But you know what else
is sneaking up on you?

13:03.260 --> 13:05.697
It'’s troops--
enemy troops, insurgents.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.482
- Damn right.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.310
- So what--what are--what are
you gonna do about that?

13:09.310 --> 13:11.921
- Yeah.
I'’m aware, Mulloy.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.627
- We'’re about five minutes
from the site,

13:22.627 --> 13:25.413
so we'’ll be out
of treeline soon.

13:25.413 --> 13:28.155
The good news is
we'’ll be out of sightline

13:28.155 --> 13:29.983
of any damn sniper,

13:29.983 --> 13:31.680
unless of course
one of those fuckers

13:31.680 --> 13:34.161
pops up from a banana tree.
Right, Carter?

13:34.161 --> 13:36.163
- Goddamn right, sir.

13:36.163 --> 13:40.123
- I realize that none
of you enlisted

13:40.123 --> 13:42.647
for any black ops,

13:42.647 --> 13:44.867
in which case you sure
as hell didn'’t think

13:44.867 --> 13:47.304
you were gonna wake up
going AWOL this morning,

13:47.304 --> 13:51.178
so thank you.

13:51.178 --> 13:55.443
When shit starts to go sideways
out there,

13:55.443 --> 13:59.621
just remember
why we'’re out there.

13:59.621 --> 14:04.495
One--figure out what the hell
happened to unit 2.

14:04.495 --> 14:09.022
Two--get eyes on whatever
aircraft crashed,

14:09.022 --> 14:10.850
get photos of it.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.416
The little intel that we have

14:12.416 --> 14:14.636
suggests that it'’s
highly experimental,

14:14.636 --> 14:18.640
in which case we need
as much info as we can.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.469
So we need to figure out
what it'’s capabilities are

14:21.469 --> 14:23.732
and what they
plan to do with it,

14:23.732 --> 14:27.301
and why the damn thing crashed
in the first place.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.042
And if all else fails,

14:29.042 --> 14:33.220
we at least have to get
photos back to HQ.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.352
It'’s very important

14:35.352 --> 14:39.704
for you to keep your eyes up
and watch your six.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.576
Carter, you good back there?

14:41.576 --> 14:43.056
- All clear.

14:43.056 --> 14:45.710
- All righty.

14:56.069 --> 14:58.985
Easy.

15:01.726 --> 15:04.338
Do not touch that.

15:04.338 --> 15:07.471
Carter.

15:07.471 --> 15:10.344
- Gotcha.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.954
- Move out.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.571
- All good, Brooks?

15:20.571 --> 15:23.879
- Yeah, I'’m good, Commander.

15:23.879 --> 15:26.708
- You get anything?

15:26.708 --> 15:28.579
- Everything'’s 5 by 5, sir.

15:31.626 --> 15:34.020
- Hey, uh...

15:34.020 --> 15:35.673
I'’ve been meaning
to talk to you about--

15:35.673 --> 15:37.110
- I know.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.155
- But I--
It'’s--I wanna tell you--

15:39.155 --> 15:41.027
- I'’m fine, Commander.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.593
I-I'’m here to be your tech
expert and lead technician,

15:42.593 --> 15:45.074
and that'’s exactly
what I'’m gonna be.

15:45.074 --> 15:49.296
- Well, if the guys give
you shit, just tell me, okay?

15:49.296 --> 15:51.254
- There won'’t be
any reasons, sir.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.777
Let'’s kick the tires.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.866
You heard the man--
let'’s keep moving.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.825
Eyes up,
be ready for anything.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.617
- Faulk, Alvarez.

16:30.554 --> 16:33.644
False alarm,
it'’s just a snake.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.520
- You shit yourself?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.783
- Yeah--twice.
How about you?

16:41.783 --> 16:44.003
- One and a half, maybe.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.539
- Take cover, take cover!

17:05.111 --> 17:07.678
- Anybody got eyes
on the hostile? Over.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.986
- Nothing to the west. Over.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.727
- I got nothing south. Over.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.208
- No movement here.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.079
- Everybody stay calm,
keep cover.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.299
I wanna make sure--shit!

17:19.299 --> 17:21.431
Where the hell
is this coming from?

17:21.431 --> 17:23.259
- I'’ve got bupkis. Over.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.434
- I'’m not seeing squat
over here.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.349
- Hang in there, hang in there.

17:27.349 --> 17:28.786
Brooks, get over here!

17:28.786 --> 17:30.310
Hang in there.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.615
- Shit!

17:31.615 --> 17:33.139
Listen to me...

17:33.139 --> 17:34.879
- Save your strength.
I gotcha, all right?

17:34.879 --> 17:37.708
Hey, Buckner'’s still with us!

17:37.708 --> 17:41.799
- All right,
everybody stay tight.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.932
- Save your strength, come on.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.803
- Relax, buddy.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.240
- That'’s where--that'’s where
the fire came from?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.111
Relax, relax, relax.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.895
- Buckner says the fire
came from up north, ahead.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.027
We need an end-around.

17:52.027 --> 17:55.030
- Alvarez, Faulk--fall in.

18:01.558 --> 18:04.213
- Sir, what about Buckner?

18:04.213 --> 18:05.780
- Brooks, how'’s he looking?

18:05.780 --> 18:07.956
- I-I think he'’s
on his way out, Commander.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.350
I-- He'’d only slow us down.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.656
- Brooks, you piece
of fucking garbage.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.049
There'’s no way we'’re
leaving a soldier behind.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.920
- Enough! Brooks is right.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.618
We can'’t afford to drag him
and dodge fire at the same time,

18:17.618 --> 18:19.576
not with the mission
still at hand.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.448
Move to the southeast,
hug the treeline.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.363
Over. Let'’s go.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.115
That'’s an order!

18:54.611 --> 18:56.570
- Nothing.

18:56.570 --> 19:00.443
- No movement anywhere.

19:00.443 --> 19:04.926
- Well, at least we know we'’re
not the only ones out here.

19:04.926 --> 19:07.711
Stay frosty, everybody, not
that I need to tell you that.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.192
Just stay on a high alert.
Copy that?

19:10.192 --> 19:11.454
- Copy that.
- Copy.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.678
- Permission to go back
for Buckner, sir.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.897
- Permission denied.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.072
We need able bodies,
and only able bodies,

19:21.072 --> 19:22.248
focused on the task at hand.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.510
- Sir, he'’s right here.

19:23.510 --> 19:24.902
- Permission denied, Plante.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.817
This is not a rescue mission.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.863
Not for the squad
that had a distress call,

19:28.863 --> 19:30.125
and certainly not for us.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.518
- Fuck.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.607
- Buckner'’s dead.
I just got his pulse.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.965
- Bring it in.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.923
Bring it in,
bring it in, Plante.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.448
Plante, bring it in.

19:50.580 --> 19:54.758
You push that shit
out of your mind right now.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.630
The only thing that you need
to keep in your mind

19:56.630 --> 20:00.068
is staying alive. Copy?

20:00.068 --> 20:02.418
- Copy.

20:02.418 --> 20:06.944
- All right, fall
back in line. Fuck.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.876
All right.

21:08.876 --> 21:11.139
- Way too quiet.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.708
- Cap, what the hell
are we doing here?

21:16.840 --> 21:20.104
- All right,
there'’s our target.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.629
Whatever the hell made impact

21:22.629 --> 21:25.458
is definitely
in that building now.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.589
Gonna have to infiltrate.

21:30.724 --> 21:34.162
Oh...12 o'’clock.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.511
Plante, you seeing this?

21:40.690 --> 21:43.258
- Yes, sir, 12 o'’clock,
I see it.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.129
- Brooks, what do you think?

21:45.129 --> 21:47.349
- Looks like some
type of foreign tech, sir.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.188
All right,

22:00.188 --> 22:04.627
Plante, Brooks,
Malloy, Faulk,

22:04.627 --> 22:06.281
I want you to head
down to that area,

22:06.281 --> 22:08.501
scout it out, but be fast.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.764
Keep your eyes open
for any movement.

22:10.764 --> 22:14.158
We need to find any traces
at all of unit 2.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.683
Keep your radios open
at all times.

22:16.683 --> 22:19.468
I wanna hear what you'’re hearing
in case you get out of earshot.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.949
- Does that copy?
- Copy.

22:21.949 --> 22:22.950
- All right.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.476
Keep your eyes up.

22:43.187 --> 22:45.929
- Captain, we'’re not seeing anything at all yet.

22:45.929 --> 22:47.017
Over.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.105
- Yeah. All clear.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.239
Yeah, we got up in our end.

22:51.239 --> 22:53.850
Just stay frost, loose,
and give me the intel.

22:53.850 --> 22:54.677
Copy.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.639
- Yeah, I'’m getting a lot
of background radiation

22:59.639 --> 23:01.771
in this entire area.

23:01.771 --> 23:04.339
- What'’s that mean--
plutonium?

23:04.339 --> 23:06.167
- Maybe they'’ve got WMDs
in there.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.865
- No, I just--I see a lot
of traces of blood and...

23:08.865 --> 23:11.172
- What?
- Gunpowder residue.

23:11.172 --> 23:12.782
there was a firefight
here recently--

23:12.782 --> 23:14.088
least that'’s
what it looks like.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.003
- It means nothing.

23:16.003 --> 23:18.788
Our positions
are still the same.

23:18.788 --> 23:21.051
Keep our eyes on the prize,
and keep our head up.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.444
- Copy.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.406
- The hell is that?

23:27.406 --> 23:28.972
- I dunno,
but that shit stink.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.508
- Shit.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.857
- That guy'’s
from the other side.

23:43.857 --> 23:44.858
- I mean, you think
one of our guys

23:44.858 --> 23:45.946
did that before he got got?

23:45.946 --> 23:47.426
- I don'’t know.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.993
- No kinda way his body could
even do something like that.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.995
Brooks, got a guess?

23:51.995 --> 23:56.826
- Um...no.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.872
- Ah! Ayúdame
Ayúdame me, por favor!

23:58.872 --> 24:00.743
Ayudame por favor,
bajame de aqui-

24:00.743 --> 24:02.441
- Shut this guy up,
he'’s giving away our position.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.094
- Los extraterestres estan aqui.

24:04.094 --> 24:05.487
- What? What is he saying?

24:05.487 --> 24:07.576
- Keeps saying
something about aliens.

24:07.576 --> 24:08.751
- Aliens?

24:08.751 --> 24:10.013
- Alien soldiers,

24:10.013 --> 24:12.320
that they'’re near
the building,

24:12.320 --> 24:13.713
I-It'’s not making any sense.

24:13.713 --> 24:16.150
- Soldados! Soldados!

24:16.150 --> 24:18.152
- Shut him up!

24:18.152 --> 24:19.370
- I'’ll be more than glad
to shut his ass up.

24:19.370 --> 24:23.505
- Stand down! Malloy!

24:46.746 --> 24:48.835
- What? What'’d he say?

24:48.835 --> 24:51.359
- He told him he doesn'’t want
him to give our position away,

24:51.359 --> 24:53.317
but he said they already
know we'’re here.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.494
- I mean, is he really
one of the deserters?

25:02.544 --> 25:04.851
- He just keeps saying "aliens,"
that they angered them,

25:04.851 --> 25:07.418
and how they'’re
gonna destroy us.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.420
- Maybe he means aliens like
foreigners, like a third party.

25:09.420 --> 25:10.900
Ask him, are there
Russian contractors

25:10.900 --> 25:12.206
that are busting in here
or something?

25:12.206 --> 25:13.642
- You guys getting this?

25:15.122 --> 25:17.907
- Ah, yeah, I'’m hearing it
loud and clear.

25:17.907 --> 25:21.955
Just try to get some more intel
on who the aggressor was.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.566
We'’ve gotta figure out what
the hell we'’re dealing with.

25:24.566 --> 25:27.351
Over.

25:37.579 --> 25:41.104
- Whoa, what are you talking
about? What did he say?

25:41.104 --> 25:44.412
- He said that
we'’re gonna find our death here,

25:44.412 --> 25:47.546
and we can'’t hope
to fight this evil.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.246
- Have him shut the hell up

25:52.246 --> 25:53.639
and stop giving away
our position

25:53.639 --> 25:54.857
or I'’m gonna put
a bullet in his ass.

25:57.904 --> 26:01.734
- Hey!
- Shut him up! Shut up!

26:03.692 --> 26:05.651
- Easy, easy, easy.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.740
- I can'’t believe--

26:07.740 --> 26:09.524
- It had to--
- It had to be done.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.744
- Because he needed to. He was
giving our position away.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.093
Right, Faulk?

26:13.093 --> 26:15.399
- No, not really.
- Had to be done.

26:15.399 --> 26:18.054
- We gotta keep moving.

26:18.054 --> 26:20.753
- Come on.
- Commander?

26:55.439 --> 26:57.703
- Well--
- What are we looking at, squad?

26:57.703 --> 27:01.228
- Some sort of tech ball--
an oversized marble.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.925
Back up.

27:02.925 --> 27:04.187
- Yo, pick it up.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.800
- Yo, what are you doing?
- I'’m just seeing--

27:07.800 --> 27:09.497
- Be careful, now,
be careful.

27:09.497 --> 27:11.107
Could be attached to a bomb.

27:11.107 --> 27:13.632
- That ain'’t no damn mine.
Do it, Malloy!

27:16.635 --> 27:18.680
Shit.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.551
- Malloy,
you'’re a fucking maniac.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.205
- Yeah, well, your mama wasn'’t
complaining last night.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.033
- Real nice, Malloy.
- Fuck you.

27:24.033 --> 27:27.907
- Hold it up, if you would,
just so I can get a reading.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.996
- Put that shit down.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.302
- I mean, are you sure this
thing ain'’t radioactive?

27:32.302 --> 27:35.349
- No, I don'’t think--
- Malloy, Malloy, Malloy.

27:35.349 --> 27:37.438
Hey, Malloy!

27:40.615 --> 27:42.878
- It'’s going up my arm!
- We need to get him back--

27:42.878 --> 27:45.576
- Drop it!
- I can'’t! It'’s in my arm!

27:45.576 --> 27:47.535
- It'’s in my arm!
It'’s in my arm!
- Don'’t move.

27:47.535 --> 27:51.321
Brooks! Brooks!

28:00.722 --> 28:02.637
- No!
- Get back.

28:03.594 --> 28:05.727
Back, back, back, back.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.947
- Keep it together.
Keep it together, goddammit.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.040
- Brooks, get your ass in gear!

28:17.260 --> 28:19.698
Commander, I don'’t see
where the fire is coming from.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.177
Do you have eyes
on the hostiles?

28:21.177 --> 28:23.702
- Negative, Faulk.
I can'’t see over here.

28:33.450 --> 28:36.323
- You good? Good?
- Yeah.

28:36.323 --> 28:38.281
- What'’s the status?

28:38.281 --> 28:41.676
- We found residue--
traces of the SEAL team.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.852
And that ball Malloy found,

28:43.852 --> 28:45.680
it wasn'’t connected to a mine,

28:45.680 --> 28:47.638
but it was dangerous
all the same.

28:47.638 --> 28:51.599
It-It went inside him, somehow.

28:51.599 --> 28:53.166
- Inside him?

28:53.166 --> 28:56.125
- I-- it just sank into him.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.998
It just permeated
right through his skin.

28:58.998 --> 29:01.304
I--I know how it sounds, but--

29:01.304 --> 29:03.306
- No, it'’s just like he said.

29:03.306 --> 29:06.788
It just, bloop, right
into his skin, and then--

29:06.788 --> 29:09.443
- Kablooey.
- From the inside out.

29:09.443 --> 29:12.968
Whatever that shit was, man,
it just went into his skin.

29:12.968 --> 29:15.101
It just fucking
blew him apart, man.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.103
- I--I think it might
have been some sort of mine

29:17.103 --> 29:19.670
or a perimeter device.

29:19.670 --> 29:22.673
Anyway, but when that
thing blew Malloy apart,

29:22.673 --> 29:24.632
we started catching fire.
I don'’t know where from, though.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.199
- Maybe--
Maybe from the building.

29:26.199 --> 29:28.462
- Yeah, most likely.

29:28.462 --> 29:29.942
There'’s not a lot
of vantage points,

29:29.942 --> 29:33.510
so maybe on the other side
of the jungle.

29:33.510 --> 29:38.472
- Doubtful. Bad angle.
Way too far.

29:38.472 --> 29:40.430
- Tech that went
inside his skin?

29:40.430 --> 29:42.824
- Yes.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.652
- That doesn'’t make any sense.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.132
- That'’s exactly what happened.

29:46.132 --> 29:48.438
- What'’s the plan, Cap?

29:48.438 --> 29:50.353
- The plan'’s still the plan.

29:50.353 --> 29:53.313
We need to find out what
happened to that plane,

29:53.313 --> 29:54.618
and we need to find out
what the hell happened

29:54.618 --> 29:56.620
to the SEAL team.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.492
- I say we call an air strike,

29:58.492 --> 30:00.189
so they can bomb the fuck
out of this jungle.

30:00.189 --> 30:01.625
- Yeah, me too, Plante,

30:01.625 --> 30:03.714
but unfortunately,
this is all we got.

30:03.714 --> 30:08.241
- What?
- We shouldn'’t even be
out here, all right?

30:08.241 --> 30:10.330
What we'’re gonna get-- We'’ll
be out of here in two hours,

30:10.330 --> 30:12.332
and that'’s for extraction.

30:12.332 --> 30:13.942
This is all we'’re gonna got.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.422
- Damn it, how are we
supposed to approach

30:15.422 --> 30:16.379
if they can hit us
with something that heavy--

30:16.379 --> 30:17.816
hit from that far away?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.295
- Yeah, perhaps
there'’s a blind side

30:19.295 --> 30:21.080
on the other side
of the building,

30:21.080 --> 30:23.952
maybe where
the aircraft crashed?

30:23.952 --> 30:25.911
- It may have blocked
their line of sight.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.869
- Yeah.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.784
Here'’s our approach.

30:32.787 --> 30:36.704
We'’re gonna move to that side
of the treeline.

30:36.704 --> 30:39.359
We'’ll stay as tight
as possible through the jungle

30:39.359 --> 30:42.536
for as long as we can,
till we get to what we hope

30:42.536 --> 30:44.538
is the blind side
of that building.

30:44.538 --> 30:50.239
And no more tripping
any damn alarms.

30:50.239 --> 30:52.459
We can'’t afford
any more of that.

30:52.459 --> 30:56.289
I'’m gonna keep as many of you
alive as possible, all right?

30:56.289 --> 30:57.943
But you gotta do the same.

30:57.943 --> 31:00.597
You gotta be smart.

31:00.597 --> 31:03.687
You gotta keep watching
each other'’s backs.

31:03.687 --> 31:08.649
And you shoot to kill
anything that is not us.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.825
Let'’s kill these
sons of bitches.

31:10.825 --> 31:12.609
Yeah?

31:28.712 --> 31:30.018
Brooks.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.891
- Yes, sir?

31:34.501 --> 31:37.983
- That explosive that
you saw down there--

31:37.983 --> 31:41.638
Was it compact, and
it permeated in his skin?

31:41.638 --> 31:43.466
- Mm-hmm.

31:45.251 --> 31:48.515
- Who do you think
would be supplying that?

31:48.515 --> 31:51.170
- Oh, you mean like
an unknown ally or something?

31:51.170 --> 31:52.649
- Or maybe even
someone on the side?

31:52.649 --> 31:55.261
A contractor, mercenary?

31:56.958 --> 31:58.568
And you never seen nothing
like this before?

31:58.568 --> 32:00.396
In development?

32:00.396 --> 32:02.703
- If they are, I haven'’t
heard a peep about it, sir.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.139
I mean, but there'’s
very few countries

32:04.139 --> 32:06.707
that are even close
to something like that.

32:06.707 --> 32:08.535
- A few countries like who?

32:10.363 --> 32:13.018
- Well, us, Russia, Israel,

32:13.018 --> 32:16.238
South Korea, Japan, India.

32:16.238 --> 32:18.414
Maybe China or Germany,
but I'’m telling you, sir,

32:18.414 --> 32:20.068
any one of those would
be a long shot, just--

32:20.068 --> 32:21.548
- Well, just humor me.
If you had to take a guess?

32:23.376 --> 32:25.204
- Well, Israel doesn'’t
really make any sense,

32:25.204 --> 32:26.205
both politically
and technologically.

32:26.205 --> 32:27.989
- Right, right.

32:27.989 --> 32:30.209
- They'’re researching
ballistics, not nanotechnology.

32:30.209 --> 32:32.254
- Mm-hmm.

32:32.254 --> 32:34.300
- If I had to take a guess,
I'’d say Russia.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.605
I mean,
they'’re the farthest along

32:35.605 --> 32:38.478
when it comes
to compound explosives.

32:38.478 --> 32:41.785
- So you'’re saying there might
be an alliance between Russia

32:41.785 --> 32:44.310
we know nothing about, with
technology that shouldn'’t exist,

32:44.310 --> 32:46.921
way out here in the jungle?

32:46.921 --> 32:48.053
- I mean, I guess it'’s possible.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.793
It'’s not likely, sir, but--

32:49.793 --> 32:51.752
- That'’s what we got
to go on right now, right?

32:51.752 --> 32:52.927
- Sure.

32:55.799 --> 32:59.194
- Carter. Take point.

32:59.194 --> 33:00.717
- Copy that.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.739
- How you holding up?

33:22.739 --> 33:25.003
- I'’m okay, sir.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.613
A little better
now I'’ve had a second

33:26.613 --> 33:29.442
to focus on anything else.

33:29.442 --> 33:32.967
- Look, you are an important
part of this mission.

33:32.967 --> 33:36.971
You know that, right?

33:36.971 --> 33:39.060
Just keep your mind right.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.888
You block all that shit out,
it doesn'’t matter.

33:40.888 --> 33:42.846
- Yeah, I'’ll do my best, sir.

33:45.893 --> 33:47.982
- What you got in
the goodie bag over there?

33:47.982 --> 33:50.506
- Perks of working at
advanced tech division, I guess.

33:50.506 --> 33:52.769
- Anything I haven'’t
seen before?

33:52.769 --> 33:54.510
- I thought you'’ve seen
everything?

33:54.510 --> 33:56.382
- Well, yeah.

33:56.382 --> 33:57.992
- I got these babies
right here--

33:57.992 --> 34:01.082
built-in spectrum analyzer,
infrared, night vision,

34:01.082 --> 34:04.085
all in this
one pair of goggles.

34:04.085 --> 34:06.131
I got stuff
more your speed, too--

34:06.131 --> 34:08.132
flash bombs,
handheld rocket launcher,

34:08.132 --> 34:10.264
compound explosives.

34:10.264 --> 34:12.789
I mean, if you need to make
noise today, sir, I got you.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.534
- Good. Let'’s move out.
- Yes, sir.

34:58.835 --> 35:02.012
- Brooks. Eyes.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.548
What do you see?

35:18.855 --> 35:21.597
- It seems clear,
as best as I can tell, sir.

35:21.597 --> 35:24.818
- If they'’ve got high ground,
this is our best possible angle.

35:24.818 --> 35:27.603
They won'’t get a clear shot
from the roof.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.866
- I'’m just checking--yeah.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.825
This is almost exactly where
the distress call came from.

35:31.825 --> 35:34.001
Four body monitors went dead

35:34.001 --> 35:35.829
about 100 yards
around the perimeter,

35:35.829 --> 35:37.787
and the last body monitor
went dead

35:37.787 --> 35:39.789
around there a minute later.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.051
- All right.

35:41.051 --> 35:43.010
- No bodies.

35:43.010 --> 35:45.578
Not just no bodies--
no anything.

35:45.578 --> 35:48.581
Does it look like a firefight
took place to anyone else here?

35:48.581 --> 35:50.713
- Not even a little.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.107
- What the hell does it mean
if they take the bodies?

35:53.107 --> 35:56.676
Why would they take the bodies
and clean it all up?

35:56.676 --> 35:58.982
- Someone who doesn'’t
wanna be found, maybe.

35:58.982 --> 36:01.681
- No, it'’s somebody who knew
we would fucking be here.

36:01.681 --> 36:02.986
It'’s freaking me out.

36:02.986 --> 36:06.381
- Yeah, same here.

36:06.381 --> 36:08.078
- Let'’s take it slow.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.994
Do not bunch up.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.996
Keep fanned out at all times,

36:12.996 --> 36:15.042
and do not pick up anything
that you did not bring with you.

36:15.042 --> 36:16.522
- Copy that?
- Copy.

36:16.522 --> 36:19.481
- Copy.
- All right, let'’s move.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.786
- I do not
like this at all.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.658
- Ho, ho, ho,
hold up, hold up.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.758
- It'’s just some weird
insurgent graffiti.

37:18.758 --> 37:20.934
- No, that'’s not
the local language, Plante.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.805
- So they'’re creative
with their tags, so what?

37:22.805 --> 37:25.678
- Just consider for a second
it might be a warning.

37:25.678 --> 37:27.680
- Yeah, so was
blowing up Malloy.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.814
- Hey, Cap. Brooks here
wants to call this mission

37:31.814 --> 37:35.557
on the account of some weird
insurgent hieroglyphic shit.

37:35.557 --> 37:39.474
- Brooks.
You getting something?

37:39.474 --> 37:41.433
- I-I mean, I think so.

37:41.433 --> 37:44.218
There'’s just these weird green
energy signatures everywhere.

37:44.218 --> 37:45.350
- What do you mean?

37:45.350 --> 37:47.134
- It'’s this weird distortion.

37:47.134 --> 37:49.441
It'’s not on any visual spectrum
that I know, I--

37:49.441 --> 37:50.616
- What do you mean?

37:50.616 --> 37:52.661
- Hold on a second. Fuck.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.664
- What are you seeing?

37:55.664 --> 37:58.537
- There'’s blood--
there'’s lots of blood.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.756
It'’s everywhere.
They'’ve wiped it clean,

38:00.756 --> 38:02.671
but there'’s traces
under this UVA light.

38:02.671 --> 38:04.282
- How do you wipe dirt
to clean of blood?

38:04.282 --> 38:05.761
- Well, that'’s not just it--

38:05.761 --> 38:07.937
there'’s these green
energy signatures here,

38:07.937 --> 38:10.505
but they'’re not on any visual
spectrum that I'’ve seen before.

38:10.505 --> 38:11.376
I don'’t know what it is,
that'’s what I'’m telling you.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.116
- Radiation, right?

38:13.116 --> 38:16.206
- No, radiation doesn'’t
make the fine tracks like this.

38:16.206 --> 38:17.556
There'’s this shit--
There'’s this.

38:21.255 --> 38:23.301
- What the hell is that?
- I don'’t know,

38:23.301 --> 38:25.955
but it'’s the same shit that
I saw blow Malloy apart.

38:25.955 --> 38:28.262
It'’s the same stuff I saw
when Buckner was cut down.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.829
When I look at it
through this UVA light,

38:29.829 --> 38:31.526
it'’s lit up
like a Christmas tree,

38:31.526 --> 38:34.616
and this is those
same green energy distortions.

38:34.616 --> 38:35.704
- It looks like
the same sort of rock

38:35.704 --> 38:37.619
that impaled
the enemy soldier.

38:37.619 --> 38:39.708
- Right.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.667
- Rocks? Y'’all talking
about rocks?

38:41.667 --> 38:43.669
This whole goddamn jungle'’s
full of rocks.

38:43.669 --> 38:44.757
You wanna see
more rock fields?

38:44.757 --> 38:46.802
My collection'’s here.

38:46.802 --> 38:48.282
- Everybody just
keep an eye open.

38:48.282 --> 38:49.849
We'’re still on the clock,
all right?

38:53.896 --> 38:56.943
All right, that'’s it.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.336
- Ready to light
this bitch up, boss?

38:58.336 --> 39:00.250
- Absolutely,
let'’s lock and load.

39:00.250 --> 39:06.082
We'’re gonna make our ingress
through that entry right there.

39:08.737 --> 39:12.524
Sklaroff, you need
a post up right here.

39:12.524 --> 39:15.309
Hold six down.
If you get any fire at all,

39:15.309 --> 39:16.745
you light that ass up fast.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.704
- With pleasure, sir.

39:18.704 --> 39:21.620
- If we'’re not back in two hours
for the extraction,

39:21.620 --> 39:23.578
I want you to go ahead
and push south,

39:23.578 --> 39:25.232
meet up with the chopper.
- But, Commander--

39:25.232 --> 39:28.409
- Meet. That'’s a direct order.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.979
- Sir, yes, sir.

39:32.979 --> 39:34.459
- All right.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.416
Time to mount up.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.812
Let'’s lock and load.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.453
- Clear!
- Clear!

40:23.116 --> 40:25.858
- Clear!
- Clear!

40:52.232 --> 40:54.364
- Get it back open,
we need an escape route.

40:58.847 --> 41:02.024
- Radio Sklaroff,
we need a back door.

41:02.024 --> 41:04.810
- Sklaroff.
Sklaroff, can you hear me?

41:04.810 --> 41:06.289
We'’re sealed in
all of a sudden. Over.

41:07.769 --> 41:09.205
- I have no earthly idea.

41:09.205 --> 41:10.511
I heard those thuds,

41:10.511 --> 41:11.817
and then the--
the entrance

41:11.817 --> 41:14.515
just wasn'’t there anymore.
Over.

41:14.515 --> 41:16.430
I'’m under attack!
They'’re everywhere!

41:20.434 --> 41:22.392
- Calm down. Hold your water,
now, hold your water.

41:22.392 --> 41:24.960
- Sklaroff. SIT REP. Over.

41:24.960 --> 41:28.137
- Ahhhh!

41:28.137 --> 41:30.444
- I say again,
what'’s your 20? Over.

41:34.404 --> 41:35.971
- What'’s he say?

41:35.971 --> 41:37.103
- I got nothing.

41:39.018 --> 41:42.369
- Hell with it--get back.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.375
- Stand down, Plante,
stand back, goddammit!

41:48.375 --> 41:50.508
- Carter, you okay?
- I'’ll live.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.857
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Dammit.

41:51.857 --> 41:54.250
- What do we got here,
what do we got?

41:54.250 --> 41:56.339
All right, it went straight
through, you'’ll be okay.

41:56.339 --> 41:58.428
Can you move your arm?

41:58.428 --> 42:02.258
- Yeah. Doesn'’t feel like
a party, but I can use it.

42:02.258 --> 42:04.391
- All right.

42:04.391 --> 42:07.655
- Brooks, give me your bandana
for a tourniquet.

42:07.655 --> 42:11.267
- Brooks!
- Not smart, at all.

42:11.267 --> 42:12.747
- I was just trying
to shoot down the door.

42:12.747 --> 42:14.532
You just got your own
goddamn man shot.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.577
You'’re making a bunch of--

42:16.577 --> 42:19.711
you'’re making a bunch of noise.

42:19.711 --> 42:23.715
That fucking thing'’s
not gonna make a dent anyways.

42:23.715 --> 42:26.761
Less ruckus, okay?
Less ruckus.

42:26.761 --> 42:28.502
- Got it.
- Okay.

42:28.502 --> 42:29.764
- Cap, can we hurry this up?

42:29.764 --> 42:31.113
- I got you, I got you.

42:31.113 --> 42:33.289
I know you hate
being sealed in, right?

42:33.289 --> 42:34.813
We still got one way out--

42:34.813 --> 42:37.555
the big-ass hole in the side
of the building.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.732
We are good, we are good.

42:40.732 --> 42:43.386
- And that big-ass
mystery bird that caused it.

42:43.386 --> 42:45.388
- Exactly, you'’re damn right.

42:45.388 --> 42:48.609
Look, the plan has not changed.

42:48.609 --> 42:50.219
It hasn'’t changed at all, okay?

42:50.219 --> 42:53.701
Keep your eyes peeled
for any traps. Copy?

42:53.701 --> 42:54.833
- Copy.
- Copy that.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.530
- All right, stay frosty.

43:19.771 --> 43:23.122
- Faulk, Brooks,
you'’re with Carter.

43:23.122 --> 43:25.037
Head that way.

43:25.037 --> 43:27.735
Plante and Alvarez,
we'’re gonna shoot to the right.

43:27.735 --> 43:29.476
If you hear anything at all,

43:29.476 --> 43:32.479
radio, radio, radio,
we will be there.

43:32.479 --> 43:35.134
- Copy that?
- Copy.

43:35.134 --> 43:37.745
- All right.

43:57.243 --> 44:00.159
- This shit ain'’t adding up.

44:00.159 --> 44:02.944
- Eyes up, watch your six.

44:47.032 --> 44:49.904
- This place is bigger
than it should be.

44:49.904 --> 44:51.689
Think about it, Sarge.

44:53.386 --> 44:55.997
- He'’s not wrong.

44:59.392 --> 45:01.046
- That room should be
on the outside.

45:01.046 --> 45:03.222
- Uh-huh.

45:08.401 --> 45:10.142
- This is not good, boss.

45:10.142 --> 45:12.274
- Just try to keep it
out of your mind.

45:17.976 --> 45:20.369
- This place is creeping me
the hell out.

45:20.369 --> 45:22.284
The sooner we get outta here,
the better.

45:22.284 --> 45:25.200
- Agreed.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.463
- Look, I hate cramped spaces,

45:27.463 --> 45:30.379
I hate the dark,
I hate being sealed in.

45:30.379 --> 45:32.599
This place has the trifecta.

45:32.599 --> 45:35.167
So believe me when I say

45:35.167 --> 45:39.475
nobody wants to get outta here
as bad as I do.

45:39.475 --> 45:43.958
But for now, let'’s just
focus on the task at hand.

45:48.702 --> 45:51.400
- Room'’s clear. Over.

45:51.400 --> 45:53.315
- Copy that. Proceed ahead
with caution. Over.

45:53.315 --> 45:56.318
- Let'’s move out.

46:27.001 --> 46:31.919
- From cave to green-ass
vegetation.

46:31.919 --> 46:34.443
This is not normal.

46:35.880 --> 46:40.580
- Cap--I don'’t like this at all.

46:46.151 --> 46:49.981
- Hey, you know that...

46:49.981 --> 46:51.460
that feeling in your chest

46:51.460 --> 46:52.418
right before shit
is about to get real?

46:52.418 --> 46:53.767
- Copy.

46:57.989 --> 46:59.729
- Yeah, me too.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.323
- How'’s our six looking?

47:29.585 --> 47:31.022
- It'’s clear, sir.

47:36.070 --> 47:38.246
- Nothing?

47:40.074 --> 47:41.859
Ah, we'’ll figure it
out here then

47:52.695 --> 47:55.394
- Shit! What the fuck is this?

48:01.356 --> 48:04.490
- Carter? We found it.

48:09.147 --> 48:10.278
What the fuck?

48:11.758 --> 48:13.455
I'’ve never seen anything
like this before

48:17.895 --> 48:20.419
Team.

48:20.419 --> 48:23.944
All hands on deck,
all hands on deck.

48:23.944 --> 48:28.906
Do an upstairs sweep
of the area and head our way.

48:28.906 --> 48:33.693
If you got anything,
radio quick. Over.

48:35.695 --> 48:39.307
- Check. That hole.

48:39.307 --> 48:41.222
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.921
Eh...

48:43.921 --> 48:45.792
looked that way
yesterday, but--

48:47.402 --> 48:48.795
Shit.

48:48.795 --> 48:51.711
We ain'’t getting
through that way.

48:53.713 --> 48:56.411
- I was afraid of that.

48:56.411 --> 48:58.892
- Fuck.

48:58.892 --> 49:03.897
- All right, just keep your eyes
open for another way out.

49:05.681 --> 49:07.161
This is a no-go.

49:37.539 --> 49:38.888
- I think
we found the reason

49:38.888 --> 49:40.368
why the lights
are all still on, sir.

49:43.458 --> 49:45.069
- What you got?

49:45.069 --> 49:47.201
- Well, I'’m not--
I'’m not sure just yet.

50:01.520 --> 50:03.087
- All right, well,
keep searching, then.

50:03.087 --> 50:04.392
- Yes, sir.

50:14.968 --> 50:16.839
- Faulk, you okay?

50:16.839 --> 50:19.016
- Yes, sir.
Just tense, I guess.

50:20.843 --> 50:23.629
- All hands on deck,
all hands on deck. Over.

50:23.629 --> 50:25.761
- All right,
you heard Adrien.

50:25.761 --> 50:28.068
Let'’s clear this last room
and head back.

50:28.068 --> 50:31.115
- Just allow us a minute,
Sarge?

50:31.115 --> 50:33.552
You remember those
green energy signatures?

50:33.552 --> 50:35.206
- Yeah, you got more of them?

50:35.206 --> 50:39.036
- Yep. But it'’s not just that.
These are vibrant.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.472
These look like
they were just made

50:40.472 --> 50:42.996
or perhaps maybe
they'’re still being made.

50:42.996 --> 50:45.520
What does that mean?

50:45.520 --> 50:48.001
Faulk? Faulk!

50:48.001 --> 50:50.308
Take it back, take it back,
take it back.

50:51.657 --> 50:52.919
- Just take a seat.

50:52.919 --> 50:55.095
Whoa, Faulk, Faulk!
Take a seat!

50:55.095 --> 50:56.488
- Faulk!
What is wrong with you?

50:56.488 --> 50:58.533
Faulk, take a seat!

51:00.796 --> 51:05.279
- Faulk, Faulk Faulk!
- Ready for entry.

51:05.279 --> 51:07.368
- Cap, do you copy? Over!

51:07.368 --> 51:09.327
- Faulk! Faulk, take a seat.

51:11.416 --> 51:14.332
- Faulk--Faulk!

51:14.332 --> 51:17.161
Faulk!

51:17.161 --> 51:18.597
- Brooks, she'’s gone!

51:18.597 --> 51:22.035
- Fuck, she'’s dead!
She'’s dead!

51:23.428 --> 51:24.646
- She'’s dead.

51:24.646 --> 51:27.345
- Aw, fuck!

51:27.345 --> 51:28.955
- All right, eyes up,
circle up.

51:28.955 --> 51:30.609
- Sarge, you can'’t
just leave her here.

51:30.609 --> 51:32.393
She'’s dead--
you can'’t just--

51:32.393 --> 51:34.352
- Brooks, she'’s gone.
We gotta go.

51:34.352 --> 51:35.396
- Okay.
- Come on.

51:37.268 --> 51:39.487
- Okay. Okay.

51:39.487 --> 51:42.186
- Cap. Faulk is down.

51:42.186 --> 51:44.623
We'’re preparing to engage. Over.

51:44.623 --> 51:49.323
Adrian: Carter hold on.
Carter.

51:49.323 --> 51:51.412
- Cap!
- I think it'’s Hobbs.

51:51.412 --> 51:52.805
- Thank god! We'’ve come
a long way to find you.

51:52.805 --> 51:54.850
- Hobbs, hang in there buddy.
- Cap.

51:54.850 --> 51:56.635
- Shit.
All right, all right.

51:59.725 --> 52:01.944
- This guy'’s barely got a pulse.

52:01.944 --> 52:04.817
- No--
- Shh, you all right?

52:04.817 --> 52:06.253
You still with us?
- No--no, no, no.

52:06.253 --> 52:09.082
- Stay up, Plante, stay up.

52:09.082 --> 52:10.736
- No, you gotta get outta here.

52:10.736 --> 52:13.652
They'’re not--
No, they'’re not--

52:13.652 --> 52:16.220
- Shh--
- They'’re not human.

52:16.220 --> 52:18.439
- You'’re not listening to me.

52:18.439 --> 52:22.748
Save yourselves. Run!

52:22.748 --> 52:25.054
- Easy, easy now...

52:26.534 --> 52:28.580
- No.
- What did he mean?

52:28.580 --> 52:31.278
- Fuck!
- What did he mean by that?

52:31.278 --> 52:33.193
- I don'’t know.

52:33.193 --> 52:35.064
- They'’re not human?

52:37.371 --> 52:40.157
- Let'’s go. Let'’s go.

52:48.643 --> 52:50.079
- Steady, Brooks, steady.

52:50.079 --> 52:52.081
- Okay.
- Okay?

52:52.081 --> 52:53.300
We gotta keep moving,
come on.

53:00.220 --> 53:01.265
You see anything?

53:01.265 --> 53:03.267
- No sir, nothing.

53:03.267 --> 53:05.791
- We'’ll reverse back down.
- Copy.

53:05.791 --> 53:06.922
- Regroup with the others.

53:17.368 --> 53:18.673
Stay close.

53:18.673 --> 53:21.328
- Copy.

53:22.547 --> 53:23.809
- I don'’t want--

53:23.809 --> 53:27.421
Sarge? Sarge?

53:27.421 --> 53:28.596
- I don'’t want anything--

53:28.596 --> 53:31.208
- Sarge!
- To happen.

53:31.208 --> 53:34.472
- Carter! Carter!

54:31.006 --> 54:34.445
- Ship appears to be
about 40 to 50 feet tall,

54:34.445 --> 54:37.752
twice as wide in the wingspan,

54:37.752 --> 54:42.540
hull as thick as hell--
couple of feet, probably.

54:42.540 --> 54:46.239
How does this thing fly?

54:46.239 --> 54:48.676
- Cap! Cap!
- Brooks!

54:48.676 --> 54:52.811
- We'’re under attack!

54:52.811 --> 54:54.639
Sergeant Carter
and Faulk are down.

54:54.639 --> 54:56.728
I tried to reach you guys,
but the radios were scrambled.

54:56.728 --> 54:59.208
- Where is Faulk?
Where is Faulk?

54:59.208 --> 55:00.906
- Yeah, the--the--
I'’m sorry, Alvarez,

55:00.906 --> 55:03.430
there'’s nothing we could do.
I tried to help her.

55:03.430 --> 55:04.518
- Who engaged?
Who engaged, buddy?

55:04.518 --> 55:06.390
- Enemy troops,
all black armor,

55:06.390 --> 55:08.000
in bulletproof vests.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.480
I tried--I tried to hit them
from point-blank range,

55:09.480 --> 55:11.090
they wouldn'’t even nudge.

55:12.787 --> 55:15.529
- Oh! It'’s them!

55:15.529 --> 55:17.792
- Identify yourself!

55:21.143 --> 55:24.146
- Take cover! Go! Go! Go! Go!

55:24.146 --> 55:25.322
Take cover, take cover!

55:36.942 --> 55:38.683
- They'’re surrounding us!

55:55.047 --> 55:56.701
- All right...

55:56.701 --> 55:59.312
- Brooks...

55:59.312 --> 56:01.662
- You shook, Brooks?

56:16.895 --> 56:18.200
- Hell, yeah.

56:18.200 --> 56:19.637
- Is this--
is this what you saw?

56:19.637 --> 56:21.290
- This is them, yes, sir.
This is them.

56:21.290 --> 56:23.118
- Okay.

56:28.080 --> 56:31.126
Follow the ship!
Follow the ship!

56:31.126 --> 56:32.345
- We might be headed
into an ambush!

56:32.345 --> 56:34.565
- Follow the ship!

56:34.565 --> 56:37.394
- Cap, you can'’t be serious!

56:37.394 --> 56:39.700
- Fall in, fall in, fall in!

56:39.700 --> 56:40.919
- You wouldn'’t go for Buckner

56:40.919 --> 56:42.007
but you wanna take
this damn thing?

56:42.007 --> 56:44.444
- Move your ass!

56:59.503 --> 57:03.550
- Clear! Clear!

57:09.208 --> 57:10.775
Clear!

57:15.257 --> 57:17.303
Clear!

57:20.741 --> 57:22.482
- Ready? On three,
on three--

57:22.482 --> 57:24.919
one, two, three.

57:31.709 --> 57:33.580
- All right

57:33.580 --> 57:34.625
- We actually got
a couple minutes

57:34.625 --> 57:36.278
but let'’s be quick in here.

57:36.278 --> 57:37.845
We got no idea what they'’re
planning outside.

57:37.845 --> 57:39.020
- Or in here.

57:39.020 --> 57:41.327
- You bet your ass.

57:41.327 --> 57:42.720
Let'’s go ahead
and check for hostile

57:42.720 --> 57:44.461
before we get overrun.

57:44.461 --> 57:46.245
- Whatever armor
these guys have,

57:46.245 --> 57:49.117
I'’ve never heard or seen
anything like it before.

57:51.859 --> 57:54.601
What about you, Brooks?
You'’re the tech guy.

57:54.601 --> 57:56.995
- No. Body armor that doesn'’t
leave traces of being hit?

57:56.995 --> 57:58.736
It doesn'’t exist.

57:58.736 --> 58:00.302
I saw you hit this thing from
yards away with .50 cal,

58:00.302 --> 58:02.000
Lieutenant Colonel.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.958
Cloth-covered body armor,
you can maybe pretend

58:03.958 --> 58:07.832
like there isn'’t a scratch,
but this is--I mean--

58:07.832 --> 58:09.573
- Cap.

58:12.227 --> 58:14.229
- Do you have any intel,
any reports whatsoever,

58:14.229 --> 58:15.622
about the prisoners--
- None.

58:15.622 --> 58:17.145
- having any type
of technology like this?

58:17.145 --> 58:19.191
Anything--anything at all?
- Sir, none whatsoever.

58:21.498 --> 58:22.716
- We gotta figure out what
the hell we'’re dealing with.

58:24.283 --> 58:27.112
Alvarez, I need a hand.

58:40.952 --> 58:45.260
- Shit!

58:45.260 --> 58:48.394
- That'’s--that'’s--

58:48.394 --> 58:50.657
- It'’s not human.

58:50.657 --> 58:53.442
- Neither is the rest
of the ship.

58:53.442 --> 58:56.663
And the armor and the
weapons--none of this is...

58:56.663 --> 58:59.013
Team, we'’ve had no idea

58:59.013 --> 59:01.712
how important
this mission really is.

59:01.712 --> 59:04.715
Brooks, document this.

59:04.715 --> 59:06.543
- Okay.

59:06.543 --> 59:08.327
- What'’s that shit on its face,
like the metal stuff?

59:08.327 --> 59:10.285
- It'’s cybernetic components.

59:10.285 --> 59:12.853
You see the wires going
down into the armor?

59:12.853 --> 59:15.116
Cap, it looks like these things
augmented themselves,

59:15.116 --> 59:18.032
or they'’ve been augmented,
anyway.

59:18.032 --> 59:19.686
- They did it to themselves.

59:19.686 --> 59:23.734
- It augments their--
it augments their senses, maybe.

59:23.734 --> 59:25.649
At this point, your guess
is as good as mine.

59:25.649 --> 59:27.825
- Your guess? Guess?

59:27.825 --> 59:29.566
That'’s not what you were saying

59:29.566 --> 59:31.611
when you said that we should get
in this goddamn spaceship.

59:31.611 --> 59:32.960
- Plante--

59:32.960 --> 59:34.832
- No, no, I'’m sick of this shit,
Cap.

59:34.832 --> 59:37.269
Why does this spaz get to call
the shots, huh?

59:37.269 --> 59:40.533
Why do you trust him more than
you trust me or Alvarez?

59:40.533 --> 59:42.448
- If he hadn'’t taken the most
lucky shot of all time,

59:42.448 --> 59:45.712
that thing would still
be firing at us.

59:45.712 --> 59:49.194
- How do we even know
this damn thing is dead?

59:52.284 --> 59:54.939
- Yep, dead.

59:54.939 --> 59:56.680
- Thanks, Mom.

59:56.680 --> 59:59.030
- All right,
we need to hustle up

59:59.030 --> 01:00:01.772
and scout the rest of the ship.

01:00:08.256 --> 01:00:10.519
Front of the ship
turns into a ramp,

01:00:10.519 --> 01:00:13.305
allowing us to make ingress.

01:00:13.305 --> 01:00:15.873
Hull is dimly lit.

01:00:15.873 --> 01:00:19.920
Appears to be a warship
of some kind,

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.575
which contained hostiles.

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:28.102
Hostile is wearing black armor,

01:00:28.102 --> 01:00:32.324
possibly the same material
ship is made out of.

01:00:32.324 --> 01:00:35.196
Bullets are completely
useless against it.

01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:37.329
Hostiles appear to be
extraterrestrial in origin,

01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:39.940
as does the rest of the ship.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:44.031
Their weapons system is far
beyond anything we'’ve ever seen.

01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:49.036
Small, marble-sized explosives,

01:00:49.036 --> 01:00:53.954
weapons system capable
of firing energy bullets

01:00:53.954 --> 01:00:58.176
and projectile blades.

01:00:58.176 --> 01:01:00.526
And I got a feeling that'’s just
the tip of the iceberg.

01:01:00.526 --> 01:01:05.444
- I gotta be honest with you,
Cap--I'’m freaking out.

01:01:05.444 --> 01:01:08.142
I mean, maybe we shouldn'’t
have come at all.

01:01:08.142 --> 01:01:11.406
All we'’ve done is
get more men killed.

01:01:11.406 --> 01:01:13.539
- Commander?
- Yep?

01:01:13.539 --> 01:01:15.410
- I'’m checking out the heat
and energy spectrum

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:16.890
aboard this ship.

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.457
Those--those green
energy signatures?

01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:20.154
I'’m seeing the same thing
on board the ship

01:01:20.154 --> 01:01:22.504
that we saw upstairs
inside this building.

01:01:22.504 --> 01:01:24.855
It'’s--it'’s everywhere.

01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:26.552
I can'’t--it'’s so dense,
I can'’t see anything--

01:01:26.552 --> 01:01:27.901
- So you'’re saying
that the energy

01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:28.989
or the radiation--what--
whatever it is,

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:30.730
it'’s coming from this thing?

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:32.079
- Yeah, that--I mean,
that'’s what it seems like.

01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:34.168
Maybe aboard this ship,

01:01:34.168 --> 01:01:36.693
that spectrum is a way to tell
where these things are, but--

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:44.352
- This dude got
some big-ass eyes, man.

01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:45.876
Shit, I'’d probably wear a helmet

01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:48.922
and a face mask too
if I was this damn ugly.

01:01:48.922 --> 01:01:51.403
- Oh, and the tentacles
don'’t bother you?

01:01:51.403 --> 01:01:54.145
- Nah. I'’ve been
on some weird dates.

01:01:56.538 --> 01:02:01.369
- So we found the ship,
and we'’re on the ship.

01:02:01.369 --> 01:02:03.981
Please tell me
you got a plan, Cap.

01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:05.243
- The only plan right now
is to go ahead

01:02:05.243 --> 01:02:07.549
with scouting the rest
of the ship out

01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:09.856
and find something
we can use.

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:12.685
- Cap, I see something
we can use.

01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:14.252
- Come on, Plante.
- No--

01:02:14.252 --> 01:02:15.688
- Remember the last time
we tried something?

01:02:15.688 --> 01:02:17.559
- No, no, no--
- Remember what happened?

01:02:17.559 --> 01:02:19.431
- I'’m just going through all the
options that we have right now.

01:02:19.431 --> 01:02:22.216
Frankly, they'’re pretty goddamn
limited, from what I can see.

01:02:22.216 --> 01:02:24.697
- I hate to admit it,
but Plante is right.

01:02:24.697 --> 01:02:26.612
- No, absolutely not.

01:02:26.612 --> 01:02:28.179
- Even if we had
them outnumbered,

01:02:28.179 --> 01:02:29.746
they clearly have
the upper hand,

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:32.313
because they have
the more advanced weaponry.

01:02:32.313 --> 01:02:34.751
And oh, yeah--we'’re stuck on
their goddamn spaceship,

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.404
where lord knows how
many of them out there

01:02:36.404 --> 01:02:38.232
or even in here.

01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:39.799
- And there--there'’s
no way of knowing

01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:41.583
if we can find the front door
and get out.

01:02:41.583 --> 01:02:47.198
- See? Alvarez gets it--
again, thanks, Brooksie.

01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:49.069
- Plante, enough.

01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:51.724
Just everybody, calm down,
be cool.

01:02:51.724 --> 01:02:55.336
Listen, we need to scout out

01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:57.948
the rest of the ship, all right?

01:02:57.948 --> 01:03:00.689
We'’re gonna stay together
the whole time.

01:03:00.689 --> 01:03:02.561
Keep your eyes peeled for
anything and everything

01:03:02.561 --> 01:03:04.824
that could be of use to get us
out of here in one piece.

01:03:04.824 --> 01:03:08.088
- Cap, we need that weapon.

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.745
- No, absolutely not.

01:03:12.745 --> 01:03:14.486
- Anything to get
the advantage, right?

01:03:14.486 --> 01:03:16.880
- Yes, normally, absolutely--
yes, you'’re right.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.751
But given the circumstances,

01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:20.405
the last time one of us picked
up one of those alien weapons,

01:03:20.405 --> 01:03:22.755
he blew up.

01:03:22.755 --> 01:03:26.715
- Desperate measures, Cap--
you taught us that.

01:03:26.715 --> 01:03:30.763
- Alvarez, I'’ve also
taught you to be smart.

01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:33.592
- Cap, it'’s smart
to at least try.

01:03:33.592 --> 01:03:36.247
- We don'’t touch anything
unless absolutely necessary.

01:03:36.247 --> 01:03:40.251
- Alvarez, you with me?

01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:42.993
- Shoot these motherfuckers
with their own BFGs?

01:03:42.993 --> 01:03:44.472
I think that'’s a great idea.

01:03:44.472 --> 01:03:48.128
- Absolutely not.
Alvarez, do not touch--

01:03:52.611 --> 01:03:55.353
Jesus. This thing weighs a ton.

01:03:55.353 --> 01:03:57.094
- Alvarez, put it down.

01:03:57.094 --> 01:04:00.010
- I'’m just gonna shoot a round
into the ground--simple.

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:03.013
- Alvarez, put that
thing down right now

01:04:03.013 --> 01:04:05.972
until we figure out what
the hell we'’re doing with this--

01:04:05.972 --> 01:04:07.626
- Alvarez, I got your back.
- Plante, you don'’t have--

01:04:07.626 --> 01:04:10.672
- Screw that, Alvarez,
fire that shit up.

01:04:10.672 --> 01:04:11.935
- What--put it--
Plante--

01:04:14.241 --> 01:04:15.503
- Ahhh!

01:04:15.503 --> 01:04:17.157
- Alvarez--Alvarez,
put it down!

01:04:17.157 --> 01:04:19.725
- Alvarez!
- Ahhh!

01:04:19.725 --> 01:04:21.596
- Drop it, put it down!
Drop it!

01:04:21.596 --> 01:04:24.599
- Ahhhh!

01:04:24.599 --> 01:04:26.514
- Shit!

01:04:31.128 --> 01:04:33.130
- Oh, fuck!

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:34.566
- Shit.

01:04:38.962 --> 01:04:41.399
- You did this!
You did this!

01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:45.011
You piece of shit!

01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:48.058
- Cap, it'’s okay...
We got Plante, we gotta go.

01:04:48.058 --> 01:04:51.931
Go, go.

01:04:54.107 --> 01:04:56.109
- Move, move.

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:04.117
Stay close,
the hallway'’s breaking!

01:05:04.117 --> 01:05:07.077
- Clear!
- Clear!

01:05:13.866 --> 01:05:15.215
- Captain?

01:05:17.609 --> 01:05:22.440
Captain! Captain! Plante!

01:05:27.706 --> 01:05:29.926
- Brooks--where the fuck
is Brooks at?

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.840
- Shit, I swear I just
saw him right behind me

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.581
in the corridor a second ago.
- Brooks?

01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:36.280
- I mean, I didn'’t see any
movement in between us--

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.021
I swear I would have saw
if there was movement.

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:40.327
Fucking idiot must have
taken the wrong turn.

01:05:40.327 --> 01:05:43.156
- Brooks, if you hear us,
say something.

01:05:43.156 --> 01:05:44.375
- It'’s just us two
against these things now.

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:46.899
- Brooks. Three
if we can count Brooks.

01:05:46.899 --> 01:05:48.596
Brooks, do you copy? Over.

01:05:53.688 --> 01:05:57.170
Fuck! Shit!

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:35.301
- That'’s why they crashed.

01:09:48.836 --> 01:09:51.796
- Footsteps.

01:09:51.796 --> 01:09:53.493
Be quiet, 13th opposition.

01:09:53.493 --> 01:09:54.625
It'’s coming!

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.195
- Oh! Oh, it'’s me!

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.458
Plante, it'’s me, stand down.
It'’s me! Jesus.

01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:02.676
- Oh, Christ, you almost
got your face blown

01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:05.026
in three different
showers.

01:10:05.026 --> 01:10:07.377
- Cap, you gotta see this.

01:10:07.377 --> 01:10:09.727
- Quickly. Plante,
hold the door.

01:10:09.727 --> 01:10:11.119
- I don'’t think
that'’s one of the troopers

01:10:11.119 --> 01:10:12.686
we were trading with.

01:10:12.686 --> 01:10:13.992
He looks like an engineer or--

01:10:13.992 --> 01:10:16.386
someone who was working
on the ship.

01:10:16.386 --> 01:10:18.214
Everything indicates that
they crash-landed here, right?

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.519
And there was something wrong

01:10:19.519 --> 01:10:21.304
with those panels
he was working on.

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:23.610
Look at this--there'’s a white
bracket, red bracket.

01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:25.395
I-I don'’t know what
this white bracket is;

01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:27.310
maybe that'’s their destination,
where they'’re headed.

01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:28.963
But this red bracket--

01:10:28.963 --> 01:10:32.489
I'’m almost positive
that'’s the Milky Way.

01:10:32.489 --> 01:10:33.838
Th-That looks
like the Milky Way,

01:10:33.838 --> 01:10:36.188
and that'’s where
they crash-landed.

01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:38.016
- You sure?
- Way, way off-course.

01:10:38.016 --> 01:10:40.018
- Positive?
- If I'’m right, yes.

01:10:40.018 --> 01:10:41.802
Anyway...

01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:43.587
- Maybe they didn'’t
come here to wage war

01:10:43.587 --> 01:10:45.371
or do anything
sinister like that.

01:10:45.371 --> 01:10:48.113
- What about all those American
soldiers that they slaughtered?

01:10:48.113 --> 01:10:50.246
I call that pretty damn
sinister, wouldn'’t you?

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.465
- Well, there'’s something else
I gotta show you, Commander.

01:10:52.465 --> 01:10:54.075
- Brooks, we ain'’t got all day.

01:10:54.075 --> 01:10:56.426
- I lit off a flash bomb
upstairs, in the building--

01:10:56.426 --> 01:10:58.906
that'’s the only time I'’ve seen
one of these things give pause.

01:10:58.906 --> 01:11:01.648
Which had me thinking,
what'’s the one constant

01:11:01.648 --> 01:11:04.999
in this entire ship and
in the surrounding building?

01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:07.654
It'’s dark. It'’s low light.
They have compound eyes.

01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:09.265
They can'’t see anything.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:10.918
I took a flash pic of the thing
without the helmet,

01:11:10.918 --> 01:11:13.269
he reeled back like it was
almost hurt or something.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:16.359
- So then we can use these
to disorient them.

01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:18.317
- Yeah, well, what I'’m hoping
is we can maybe surround them

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:19.797
and keep letting off
these flash bombs,

01:11:19.797 --> 01:11:21.451
and let off another one

01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:24.018
every time it starts
getting its bearings again.

01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:25.846
- All right.

01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:28.109
- Well, and that'’s the--
that'’s the problem, Plante.

01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:30.024
Obviously, we-we'’re gonna
have to get up close,

01:11:30.024 --> 01:11:31.461
try to find seams
in their armor,

01:11:31.461 --> 01:11:34.028
which means we have
to engage up close.

01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:35.987
- Flash bombs.

01:11:35.987 --> 01:11:38.816
We need real explosives,
not some flash bombs.

01:11:38.816 --> 01:11:41.558
- Well, on that last point,

01:11:41.558 --> 01:11:43.124
I picked up their explosive--

01:11:43.124 --> 01:11:45.344
those marble things
that blew Malloy apart.

01:11:45.344 --> 01:11:47.433
- Now that'’s what the fuck
I'’m talking about.

01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:50.349
- All right, chances are we'’re
only gonna get one shot at this,

01:11:50.349 --> 01:11:53.265
so we gotta make it count.

01:11:53.265 --> 01:11:57.878
It was an honor and a privilege
serving alongside both of you.

01:12:00.751 --> 01:12:02.492
- I don'’t like it.

01:12:02.492 --> 01:12:04.145
- That'’s the plan, Plante.

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:06.800
- Why? Because
this jerkoff says so?

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.542
I'’m not coming along
with that plan.

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:14.417
All-out assault
is how we'’re doing this.

01:12:14.417 --> 01:12:16.854
That chopper will be here
in 15 minutes.

01:12:16.854 --> 01:12:18.464
We gotta move.

01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:25.471
- Plante!

01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:26.733
- Ahhh!

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:28.996
- Plante!

01:12:33.392 --> 01:12:34.959
Plante!

01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:37.440
Fuck! Eyes!

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.746
- Eyes!

01:12:49.321 --> 01:12:50.801
- Those are working, Cap.

01:12:50.801 --> 01:12:54.674
- What are you doing?
Brooks! Brooks!

01:12:54.674 --> 01:12:58.374
Brooks, get out of there!
Brooks!

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:01.159
Brooks!
Get out of there! Brooks!

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.653
- Shit.

01:13:19.177 --> 01:13:21.222
- Ahhhhh!

01:13:25.313 --> 01:13:29.448
Let'’s go--move your ass.
Come on, let'’s go!

01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:31.537
Move your ass, let'’s go!

01:13:44.376 --> 01:13:46.770
- Cap!

01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:50.600
Cap, no, no, no, come on.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.169
Cap, what'’s wrong?
Are you hit?

01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:59.304
Goddammit--damn it, damn it,
damn it, fuck.

01:13:59.304 --> 01:14:02.307
- I need you to be calm. Damn.

01:14:02.307 --> 01:14:03.787
- Sir, you--
- I know.

01:14:03.787 --> 01:14:05.441
- You'’re--
- It'’s bad.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:08.922
- Okay. Okay. I'’ll find...

01:14:08.922 --> 01:14:10.663
maybe I can bandage you up.

01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:12.360
- I think I'’m well past
first aid at this point.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.797
- Huh?

01:14:13.797 --> 01:14:15.581
- I think I'’m first aid
at this point.

01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:18.671
When those fuckers...

01:14:18.671 --> 01:14:22.022
pop out again...

01:14:22.022 --> 01:14:25.243
I'’ll throw myself at them,
give you time.

01:14:25.243 --> 01:14:28.376
If anyone'’s got a good enough
chance of getting out of here,

01:14:28.376 --> 01:14:29.943
it'’s gotta be you,
I figure, right?

01:14:29.943 --> 01:14:31.684
- I think I-I might
have one plan, sir,

01:14:31.684 --> 01:14:33.207
but it'’s--
but it'’s a long shot.

01:14:33.207 --> 01:14:35.427
- Sometimes they'’re
the best ones, Brooks.

01:14:35.427 --> 01:14:36.733
- Sir, just let me
fight with you.

01:14:36.733 --> 01:14:38.430
My nerves are gone,
I promise.

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:40.171
You know how long I'’ve been
training hand-to-hand--

01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:43.217
- You know that'’s not gonna get
you outta here, Brooks.

01:14:43.217 --> 01:14:45.393
It'’s not gonna get
your ass outta here.

01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:50.137
Look, you'’re getting
outta here, okay?

01:14:50.137 --> 01:14:51.748
And I wanna give you
enough time to do so.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.536
When you get back to HQ--

01:14:57.536 --> 01:14:59.320
- Yes, sir.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.106
- I want you to give them this.

01:15:07.024 --> 01:15:08.721
When you get back to HQ--

01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:10.201
- Uh-huh?

01:15:10.201 --> 01:15:11.985
- You give that to them,
along with your photos

01:15:11.985 --> 01:15:15.162
Get everything in it, okay?

01:15:15.162 --> 01:15:17.687
Okay?

01:15:17.687 --> 01:15:20.080
Just like it'’s supposed to be.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.865
- You make a big bang yourself,
Lieutenant Colonel.

01:15:21.865 --> 01:15:24.128
- Go!

01:15:25.912 --> 01:15:29.481
You bet your ass.
You bet your ass.

01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:45.628
- Come on, motherfucker!

01:15:45.628 --> 01:15:49.980
Come on, bitch!
Motherfucker!

01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:38.942
- Fuck, fuck.

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:22.774
Fuck, you don'’t breathe,
do you?

01:21:09.473 --> 01:21:12.302
Just like you said, Commander.
Full force.

01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:00.959
You crash-landed here.

01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:05.224
I knew you did.

01:22:05.224 --> 01:22:06.791
We just fired on you first,

01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:09.185
but you were just
trying to fix your ship.

01:22:09.185 --> 01:22:12.928
And the warnings outside,
I saw them.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:17.845
I--I--I knew--
I ignored them.

01:22:17.845 --> 01:22:20.457
You killed all those men,
though.

01:22:20.457 --> 01:22:23.460
You killed my commander.

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:26.158
And with our first unit
and then us,

01:22:26.158 --> 01:22:30.162
obviously you thought
we just wanted war.

01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:36.516
Which means that it'’s
the two of us, then.

01:22:36.516 --> 01:22:38.475
So we'’re either gonna
fight or call a truce,

01:22:42.087 --> 01:22:43.871
and I got nothing
left to fight you with.

01:22:45.699 --> 01:22:47.092
I couldn'’t even fight you
if I could.

01:23:10.376 --> 01:23:12.683
Good luck.

01:23:30.614 --> 01:23:34.574
Hey! Hey! I'’m here!

01:23:34.574 --> 01:23:37.273
I'’m here! I'’m here--

01:23:44.671 --> 01:23:47.152
I'’m here, I'’m here!

01:23:47.152 --> 01:23:49.807
I'’m here.
