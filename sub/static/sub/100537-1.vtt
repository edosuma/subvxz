Jesus, Will.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.105
Thanks.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.173
It's gonna be a swell

Hello, sir.
-Hello to you, sir.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.134
You may fall in line

05:36.136 --> 05:37.436
Very good.

Sorry, sir.

I'm Leonard O'Hara.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.388
I have hypersensitivities.

Vern, go field.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.169
Vernon:
<i> Over into it.</i>

06:44.171 --> 06:45.437
Yup, yup, yup.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.841
Got a lot stronger.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.578
Where'd you get the gum?

06:54.882 --> 06:56.148
Great, thank you.
-Okay.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.552
Out of the way, Leonard.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.019
Leonard:
<i> What's that book</i>
<i> that you're reading?</i>

07:02.356 --> 07:05.357
Here, and then you pull...

07:05.359 --> 07:09.161
There's this one part where
T-Rex puts this other-

07:10.330 --> 07:11.630
Here it is.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.299
Leonard:
<i> I love storybooks.</i>

07:14.301 --> 07:16.368
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.010
All this open wilderness

07:25.946 --> 07:27.212
I wanna help.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.881
Well then stay out
of the bloody way.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.652
I'm not here to babysit, Will.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.001
Here, take this, Ray.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.802
Good to see you, too.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.539
All right, boys,
it's rough water,

09:00.541 --> 09:02.207
so let's all work together.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.909
All right, let's go!

09:10.384 --> 09:12.050
Arthur:
<i> How many can't swim?</i>

09:12.252 --> 09:13.518
About half.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.288
And those who can
need improvement.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.958
And then there's Vernon.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.660
<i> He's a fish, that one.</i>

09:22.596 --> 09:24.262
<i> Couple lifeguard medals.</i>

Vernon:
<i> Last one there has to</i>
<i> bunk beside Frank.</i>

09:28.535 --> 09:30.368
You wanna swim now fellas?
Waller:<i> Sure.</i>

09:37.444 --> 09:39.277
Samuel de Champlain

09:39.279 --> 09:42.047
recorded his travels to
Balsam Lake in his diary.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.115
<i> The Ojibway had a</i>
<i> settlement here,</i>

09:44.885 --> 09:47.385
<i> used the lake as</i>
<i> their travel route.</i>

09:47.387 --> 09:49.287
<i> They hunted these very woods.</i>

09:49.856 --> 09:51.923
<i> They lived and they died here.</i>

09:52.626 --> 09:54.559
They're buried
beneath your feet.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.894
(sneezes)

09:55.896 --> 09:58.697
Robert:
<i> Centuries later,</i>
<i> voyageurs portaged here</i>

09:58.699 --> 10:00.665
<i> and stopped for the night.</i>

10:00.667 --> 10:02.734
Slept right under
their canoes.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.672
Now all you know each other,
but Mister Lambden's new,

10:07.674 --> 10:09.140
<i> so give him your respect.</i>

10:09.676 --> 10:12.410
I hope to meet all of you
individually throughout the day.

10:13.513 --> 10:16.514
At this camp, you'll get
out of it what you put in.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.516
Games, duty, devotion.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.853
Canon Rutherford is arriving
the day after tomorrow,

10:21.855 --> 10:24.756
so expect a series of
lectures on Wednesday.

10:25.692 --> 10:26.958
Questions?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.028
Mr. Wigington.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.631
When does Waller get here?
(boys chuckle)

10:34.735 --> 10:37.168
The rest of the boys are
paddling up from Peterborough

10:37.170 --> 10:38.670
with Mister Manley.

10:38.672 --> 10:39.671
Oh, that's great.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.172
Jack:
<i> We get to hear his stories.</i>

10:42.342 --> 10:43.908
Go ahead.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.645
(boys cheering)

10:47.914 --> 10:49.481
Don't have a
hypersensitivity to water,

10:49.483 --> 10:50.982
do you, Leonard?

10:51.585 --> 10:53.184
Mister Lambden.

10:53.186 --> 10:57.255
(screaming)

10:57.691 --> 10:59.190
His father drowned.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.526
Oh god, I'm an idiot.

11:01.528 --> 11:02.794
You didn't know.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.865
Leonard, go light the
stove, would you?

11:06.867 --> 11:08.133
Mhm.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.373
You and Vernon'll have him
swimming in a few days.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.809
You do know how to swim?

11:17.811 --> 11:19.878
My father made sure of that.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.280
Most of these boys
don't have fathers.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.282
They never came back.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.485
<i>They're adrift, Mister Lambden.</i>

11:27.487 --> 11:28.753
<i> They've been feminized</i>
<i> by their mothers</i>

11:28.755 --> 11:30.155
<i> and their female teachers.</i>

11:30.157 --> 11:32.357
This modern world
does not serve them.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.759
I think it's a pretty
exciting time to be a boy.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.228
They spend all their days
sitting in front of the radio.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.463
They need to get outdoors.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.698
Well, sure, but-

11:39.700 --> 11:41.433
Canon Rutherford has

11:41.435 --> 11:44.135
always extolled the virtues
of a strenuous life.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.706
I heard of a Father Rutherford
who was at the Somme.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.741
He braved the front lines.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.143
Disobeyed his superiors
to be there.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.646
He's now Secretary of
the Anglican Council.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.882
Arthur:
<i> I look forward to his lecture.</i>

12:05.292 --> 12:11.196

12:27.013 --> 12:29.180

12:29.182 --> 12:30.682
Stick together!

12:32.953 --> 12:35.754
(boys screaming)

12:41.294 --> 12:43.261
Everybody to the canoe!

12:44.498 --> 12:45.764
Arthur:
<i> Goddammit!</i>

12:47.701 --> 12:49.934
Waller, get the paddles.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.573
Waller, fetch the canoe!

12:57.911 --> 12:59.410
Waller:
<i> Here it is, Coach.</i>

13:00.413 --> 13:02.380
Arthur:
<i> We need the paddles!</i>

13:04.818 --> 13:06.317
Allen!

13:06.319 --> 13:07.585
Yes!

13:08.355 --> 13:09.454
Burkett!

13:09.456 --> 13:10.755
Here!

13:11.358 --> 13:13.024
Burgess?

13:13.026 --> 13:14.459
Here!

13:14.461 --> 13:15.460
Robert:
<i> Clarke?</i>

13:15.462 --> 13:16.995
Here!

13:16.997 --> 13:18.296
Robert:
<i> Edwards?</i>

13:19.299 --> 13:21.566
Waller:
<i> Joseph, Joseph?</i>

13:21.568 --> 13:22.967
Vernon:
<i> Joseph?</i>

13:22.969 --> 13:24.235
<i> Joseph?</i>

13:24.671 --> 13:26.304
Joseph Edwards?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.806
Waller:
<i> Joe? Do you see him?</i>

13:28.408 --> 13:29.674
Boy:
<i> Joseph?</i>

13:30.644 --> 13:31.910
<i> Joseph?</i>

13:40.086 --> 13:42.453
(sombre instrumental)

13:42.455 --> 13:44.622
Robert:
<i> Well boys, there's</i>
<i> another wave.</i>

13:44.624 --> 13:46.024
(panicked chatter)

13:46.026 --> 13:49.861
Robert:
<i> Hold on, boys, and</i>
<i> stay close to the boat!</i>

13:49.863 --> 13:51.629
(panicked chatter)
(tense instrumental)

13:51.631 --> 13:53.498
Boy:
<i> Help!</i>

13:53.500 --> 13:55.967
(panicked screaming)

13:55.969 --> 13:57.569
(dramatic music)

13:57.571 --> 14:03.741
(water moving)

14:03.743 --> 14:06.144
(screaming)

14:07.247 --> 14:08.479
Boy:
<i> Waller!</i>

14:08.481 --> 14:09.147
<i> Waller!</i>

14:09.149 --> 14:10.682
(boys cheering)

14:10.684 --> 14:12.450
Boy:<i> Waller, wait!</i>
<i> -Whoo!</i>

14:12.452 --> 14:14.285
Arthur:
<i> So this is the war canoe?</i>

14:14.287 --> 14:15.453
Thirty-footer.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.155
Beautiful.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.757
Robert:
<i> Tomorrow we'll take her</i>
<i> across the lake to Coboconk.</i>

14:19.759 --> 14:21.860
<i> Fetch some supplies, canoes.</i>

14:22.662 --> 14:23.661
<i> We need 11.</i>

14:23.663 --> 14:25.029
Arthur:
<i> That many?</i>

14:25.031 --> 14:26.798
Robert:
<i> We need extra boys to</i>
<i> bring the canoes back.</i>

14:26.800 --> 14:27.799
Of course.

14:27.801 --> 14:29.367
We'll sleep on the beach,

14:29.369 --> 14:31.369
paddle back in the morning.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.804
Sounds like fun.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.806
There's a tuck shop
there, Gordon.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.708
If I can convince
my lieutenant here,

14:36.710 --> 14:38.409
we'll have shaved cherry ice.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.711
Yes, please.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.148
Robert:
<i> Welcome, voyageurs!</i>

14:44.150 --> 14:45.183
Greetings.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.051
<i> Our treasurer, Sydney Manley.</i>

14:47.053 --> 14:48.820
Arthur:
<i> Arthur Lambden.</i>

14:48.822 --> 14:49.921
Let me take that.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.222
Ah, thanks.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.759
And this hellion
is George Waller.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.060
Yeah.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.264
<i> Fall in, boys.</i>

14:59.266 --> 15:01.699
He has a fascination
with the war.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.601
Quite lucky he missed it.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.537
This is Ray Allen.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.872
He's a Sunday school teacher

15:07.874 --> 15:09.540
and plans on entering
the ministry one day.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.075
Oh, I'm not too sure
about that, Mr. Butcher.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.411
Well, time for
some fun, I say.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.679
Thank you.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.482
That any good?

15:18.051 --> 15:19.517
It's a swell story.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.986
Well, it's no Shakespeare.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.389
Fitzgerald's the
Lost Generation,

15:24.391 --> 15:25.657
like us.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.258
Is that what we're called?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.293
Waller:
<i> Hey, Gordon!</i>

15:28.295 --> 15:29.327
Gordon:
<i> What?</i>

15:29.329 --> 15:30.328
George Waller!

15:30.330 --> 15:31.529
Leave him alone!

15:31.531 --> 15:32.664
I'm not doing anything.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.166
Uh oh, George.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.667
Robert:
<i> Unpack your gear or</i>
<i> rake the latrine.</i>

15:35.669 --> 15:36.701
Jack:
<i> How was it?</i>

15:36.703 --> 15:37.702
Waller:
<i> Aces.</i>

15:37.704 --> 15:39.270
You shoulda met us
in Peterborough.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.672
My mom made me come on a bus

15:40.674 --> 15:42.340
with my little brother.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.108
Hey, Willy Killjoy.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.643
I haven't seen you
since last summer.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.711
I'm Will now.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.379
Oh, you've grown.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.614
Will:
<i> Two inches.</i>

15:49.616 --> 15:51.282
Yeah, you've grown funny.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.884
(laughs)

15:52.886 --> 15:55.053
Waller:
<i> Now, Jack, tell</i>
<i> me all about her.</i>

15:55.055 --> 15:56.788
<i> Don't skimp on any of</i>
<i> the dirty details.</i>

15:56.790 --> 15:57.855
(whistle blows)

15:57.857 --> 15:59.457
(shouting and chattering)

15:59.459 --> 16:00.458
I'm open!

16:00.460 --> 16:02.060
Pass it!

16:02.062 --> 16:04.662
(shouting and chattering)

16:04.664 --> 16:05.997
Right here!

16:05.998 --> 16:07.331
Boy:
<i> We're on the same</i>
<i> team, Waller!</i>

16:07.334 --> 16:08.399
Jack:
<i> Right here! Come on!</i>

16:08.401 --> 16:09.367
- Leonard, incoming!

16:09.369 --> 16:10.735
Arthur:
<i> Work as a team!</i>

16:10.737 --> 16:12.337
Vernon:
<i> Come on, pass it!</i>

16:12.339 --> 16:13.871
Boys:
<i> Oh, whoa.</i>

16:13.873 --> 16:15.940
(laughing)
(whistle blows)

16:17.377 --> 16:18.409
Jack:
<i> Look out.</i>

16:18.411 --> 16:19.410
<i> Waller's here.</i>

16:19.412 --> 16:20.411
Sorry-
Waller:<i> You little prick.</i>

16:20.413 --> 16:21.412
Vernon:
<i> Whoa, hey, hey, hey.</i>

16:21.414 --> 16:22.413
Stop, stop, stop.
(whistle blows)

16:22.415 --> 16:23.414
Waller:
<i> That wasn't fair!</i>

16:23.416 --> 16:24.682
Enough!

16:25.018 --> 16:26.517
Boys:
<i> Oooh.</i>

16:26.519 --> 16:28.186
Arthur:
<i> All right, okay.</i>

16:29.456 --> 16:30.755
(Waller cries out)

16:31.057 --> 16:32.423
Take a walk.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.925
Calm down.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.940
Mr. Lambden,

16:48.942 --> 16:50.641
<i> you're in charge now.</i>

16:54.981 --> 16:56.247
(whistle blows)

16:57.650 --> 17:00.551
Arthur:
<i> Okay, boys, back to it.</i>

17:02.055 --> 17:03.755
What's the axe for?

17:08.094 --> 17:10.294
Don't be sore because
I play to win.

17:10.296 --> 17:13.865
Robert:
<i> You aren't even aware</i>
<i> that there's other players.</i>

17:13.867 --> 17:15.333
It's the George Waller game.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.801
I'm a good player.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.237
And you think that's how
a captain leads his team?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.205
If my captain was like you,

17:21.207 --> 17:22.306
I would be dead.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.208
It's a screwy game.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.677
That has been played on this
lake for thousands of years.

17:26.679 --> 17:27.779
<i> Warriors specific-</i>

17:27.781 --> 17:29.147
Waller:
<i> Oh, fine, then,</i>
<i> I'm a warrior.</i>

17:29.149 --> 17:30.748
Robert:
<i> A warrior's goal</i>

17:30.750 --> 17:33.718
<i> is to bring honour and</i>
<i> glory to their tribe.</i>

17:33.720 --> 17:35.219
Not themselves.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.262
Last camp left firewood.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.799
Pick on something
bigger than yourself.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.600
It's a tree.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.502
I never cut down a
tree in my life.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.875
That's your problem.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.978
Waller:
<i> Well you can't make me.</i>

18:03.650 --> 18:07.718
(breathing heavily)

18:16.796 --> 18:18.296
(Waller cries out)

18:20.366 --> 18:22.433
(grunting)

18:26.339 --> 18:32.276
(gentle instrumental)

18:32.278 --> 18:35.346
¶

19:17.390 --> 19:21.459
(wood snapping)

19:36.543 --> 19:37.542
Whoa.
-Crap.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.843
Oh my god.
-Oh my god.

19:38.845 --> 19:39.844
Waller, you do this?

19:39.846 --> 19:41.145
Waller:
<i> Whoohoohoo!</i>

19:41.146 --> 19:42.445
Vernon:
<i> That wasn't you.</i>
<i> This is you?</i>

19:42.448 --> 19:44.615
(overlapping
disbelieving praise)

19:44.617 --> 19:46.017
This is him?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.285
<i> What? (chuckles)</i>

19:56.930 --> 19:59.063
Amazing.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.064
Come here!

20:00.066 --> 20:01.899
Whoo, yeah!

20:01.901 --> 20:03.167
Oh!

20:04.270 --> 20:05.736
(boys laugh)

20:05.738 --> 20:11.075
(gentle music)

20:11.077 --> 20:16.581
¶

20:16.583 --> 20:17.815
(water splashing)

20:17.817 --> 20:19.083
Will:
<i> Jack!</i>

20:21.487 --> 20:23.487
Get the youngest up!

20:26.359 --> 20:28.426
Be careful you
don't bust a hole.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.663
You're bleeding.

20:32.665 --> 20:33.931
What?

20:37.303 --> 20:38.569
Robert?

20:39.038 --> 20:40.304
Robert?

20:49.882 --> 20:53.251
(gasps)

20:53.253 --> 20:54.318
You can't swim
with your knees.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.553
Get up.
-No!

20:55.555 --> 20:56.821
Now!

20:59.726 --> 21:00.858
Boys in the water,

21:00.860 --> 21:02.994
take off your shoes,
anything heavy.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.832
<i> Take off your trousers,</i>
<i> they'll drag you down!</i>

21:18.144 --> 21:19.944
Where did we capsize?

21:19.946 --> 21:22.446
Gordon, where did we capsize?

21:22.448 --> 21:24.348
Gordon:
<i> Near Grand Island, I think.</i>

21:25.318 --> 21:27.385
Robert:
<i> What are the chances</i>
<i> of us gaining a shore?</i>

21:28.955 --> 21:30.955
Do you see the shore?

21:35.728 --> 21:36.961
Oliver:
<i> Mr. Butcher?</i>

21:36.963 --> 21:38.362
Mark's hurt.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.797
He banged his head.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.499
I'm fine, I'm fine!

21:42.869 --> 21:44.368
I'll go.

21:50.043 --> 21:52.109
We need to stop the bleeding.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.377
Oliver:
<i> Here.</i>

21:54.981 --> 21:56.447
Arthur:
<i> Wrap it up.</i>

21:57.684 --> 21:59.750
Mark, switch spots with me.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.752
Stay where you are.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.920
There's room.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.355
It's not about room!

22:04.357 --> 22:05.807
We'll lose buoyancy.

22:05.808 --> 22:07.258
<i> If we try and flip it it will</i>
<i> fill up with water and sink.</i>

22:07.260 --> 22:08.759
I'm coming down.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.797
I can't dive for you
every time you sink.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.375
<i> ¶ My paddle's</i>
<i> keen and bright</i>

22:24.377 --> 22:25.643
<i> ¶ Flashing with silver</i>

22:25.645 --> 22:27.611
<i> ¶ Follow the wild</i>
<i> goose flight</i>

22:27.613 --> 22:29.847
<i> ¶ Dip, dip and swing ¶</i>

22:29.849 --> 22:31.615
¶ Dip, dip and
swing her back

22:31.617 --> 22:33.884
¶ Flashing with silver

22:33.886 --> 22:35.519
¶ Follow the wild
goose flight

22:35.521 --> 22:37.722
¶ Dip, dip and swing ¶

22:37.724 --> 22:40.391
¶ Get up, get out of bed

22:40.393 --> 22:43.361
¶ Cheer up, cheer up,
the sun is red

22:43.363 --> 22:44.829
¶ Live, live

22:44.831 --> 22:45.930
¶ Love, love

22:45.932 --> 22:48.065
¶ Laugh and be happy ¶

22:48.067 --> 22:53.738
(gentle instrumental)

22:53.740 --> 22:55.005
Oh, wow.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.241
Ohh.

22:58.578 --> 23:01.078
(applauding)

23:01.080 --> 23:02.513
(gentle piano music)

23:02.515 --> 23:12.523
(off beat notes)

23:15.628 --> 23:16.694
(squeaking)

23:16.696 --> 23:18.162
(laughing)

23:19.065 --> 23:25.436
(lively harmonica music)

23:25.438 --> 23:28.105
Waller:
<i> Then will he strip his</i>
<i> sleeve and show his scars,</i>

23:28.107 --> 23:31.675
<i> and say "These wounds</i>
<i> I had on Crispin's day."</i>

23:31.677 --> 23:35.813
<i> Old men forget; yet</i>
<i> all shall be forgot,</i>

23:35.815 --> 23:38.349
But he'll remember,
with advantages,

23:38.351 --> 23:40.251
What feats he did that day.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.953
From this day to the
ending of the world,

23:42.955 --> 23:45.089
but we in it shall
be remembered,

23:45.091 --> 23:49.827
We few, we happy few,
we band of brothers;

23:49.829 --> 23:53.030
<i> For he to-day that</i>
<i> shed his blood with me</i>

23:53.032 --> 23:54.532
<i> Shall be my brother.</i>

23:55.368 --> 23:56.634
(in unison) Amen.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.373
We need 11 boys to take
the canoe across the lake.

24:02.375 --> 24:05.643
Sign up with Mr. Lambden
throughout the day tomorrow.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.445
<i> Vernon, Waller?</i>

24:07.447 --> 24:08.546
<i> We'll need you in</i>
<i> the engine room.</i>

24:08.548 --> 24:10.381
I'm sore from the trip up.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.650
Sometimes God uses
pain as a chisel

24:12.652 --> 24:14.351
to model human character.

24:14.353 --> 24:16.754
Tell God to take
it easy already.

24:16.756 --> 24:17.922
(stifled laughter)

24:17.924 --> 24:19.523
Excuse me?

24:19.525 --> 24:20.925
I'm coming.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.092
I'll go.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.794
I wanna mail a letter.

24:24.230 --> 24:25.496
Leonard?

24:26.232 --> 24:27.898
Will?

24:27.900 --> 24:29.400
You'll be sure to volunteer?

24:29.402 --> 24:30.668
(sighs)

24:38.244 --> 24:43.314
(loon calling)
(wolf howling)

24:57.597 --> 24:58.863
Ray?

25:00.466 --> 25:01.999
<i> Raymond?</i>

25:02.001 --> 25:03.267
What?

25:04.837 --> 25:06.103
I was wondering.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.273
Since you're joining
the priesthood,

25:10.009 --> 25:11.909
does that mean you're
not allowed to-

25:12.812 --> 25:13.878
beat the bishop?

25:13.880 --> 25:16.947
(laughter)

25:19.519 --> 25:21.485
Dileas Gu Brath.

25:21.487 --> 25:23.454
Digitus Impudicus.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.559
Where are you going?

25:29.195 --> 25:30.294
None of your potatoes.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.696
The adults need
a smoke, Willy.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.665
I'm just going outside

25:34.667 --> 25:36.734
and I may be some time.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.838
Will:
<i> What's that from?</i>

25:40.840 --> 25:42.106
Ray:
<i> Laurence Oates?</i>

25:42.742 --> 25:44.408
Have you ever heard
the story of

25:44.410 --> 25:46.744
Captain Scott's
expedition to the South Pole?

25:46.746 --> 25:48.212
Yeah, they get lost
in a blizzard.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.380
Everyone was
starving and dying.

25:49.382 --> 25:50.648
Ray:
<i> That's right.</i>

25:51.284 --> 25:55.252
Laurence Oates was
the worst of the lot.

25:55.254 --> 25:58.789
His feet were
frostbitten, gangrenous.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.891
He was slowing
down the group,

26:00.893 --> 26:03.027
and he knew

26:03.029 --> 26:05.429
that if Captain Scott and the
others wanted to make it out,

26:05.431 --> 26:08.032
they'd have to
leave him behind.

26:08.034 --> 26:11.435
So one night,

26:11.437 --> 26:13.404
he walks out
of the tent,

26:13.406 --> 26:16.073
right into a snowstorm,
it's minus 40,

26:16.075 --> 26:17.975
and the last thing
that he said was-

26:17.977 --> 26:19.610
(fart)

26:19.612 --> 26:21.412
(laughing)

26:21.414 --> 26:23.247
Oh my goodness.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.517
Please excuse me,
do continue, Raymond.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.185
Will:
<i> That reeks.</i>

26:28.654 --> 26:30.354
You're an asshole.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.925
(chuckling)

26:44.470 --> 26:54.378
(humming)

27:15.868 --> 27:17.935
(sighs)

27:35.921 --> 27:37.821
Where did you serve?

27:40.493 --> 27:41.792
Ypres.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.496
Massacre.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.033
You?

27:49.035 --> 27:50.467
Somme.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.703
The infantry.

27:52.704 --> 27:54.938
I fell in a shell hole
and buggered up my knee.

27:54.940 --> 27:59.143
Some pals dragged me
out before I drowned.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.611
You were lucky.

28:01.714 --> 28:04.782
Four men pulled me out,
one brought me back.

28:05.284 --> 28:06.583
Not lucky.

28:07.186 --> 28:11.488
I became an orderly
with General Currie.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.957
Carried the Allied
colours into Mons.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.528
What was Currie like?

28:18.364 --> 28:21.999
He was respected,
Mr. Lambden,

28:22.001 --> 28:24.068
but he didn't win
the men over.

28:24.837 --> 28:27.071
Could you call me Arthur?

28:27.073 --> 28:29.073
I reckon a boys' camp
is the last place

28:29.075 --> 28:30.974
to stand on ceremony.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.778
Robert.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.947
Mr. Butcher in
front of the boys.

28:36.949 --> 28:38.248
Of course.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.222
He doesn't let me
smoke in here.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.490
<i> (chuckles)</i>

28:48.594 --> 28:51.095
Sydney:
<i> What time are you</i>
<i> setting that for?</i>

28:51.097 --> 28:52.362
4:30.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.433
You know, I grew
up on a farm

28:56.435 --> 28:59.403
and my dad woke me at five.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.404
Those were the days.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.673
A father taught
his son a trade.

29:02.675 --> 29:04.575
Sydney:
<i> I hated growing up on a farm.</i>

29:06.378 --> 29:08.545
We were just telling
old war stories.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.583
He served at Ypres.

29:15.121 --> 29:18.422
<i> 100,000 boys in one day.</i>

29:18.424 --> 29:21.325
(gentle guitar strumming)

29:21.327 --> 29:23.160
In my interview,

29:23.162 --> 29:26.230
they told me you were decorated
four times for bravery.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.067
Three, they were
being grandiose.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.404
Sydney:
<i> He's a humble hero.</i>

29:36.976 --> 29:39.643
A hero's just a man who's
too afraid to run away.

29:41.981 --> 29:45.048
(gentle guitar strumming)

29:47.219 --> 29:49.219
Thank god it
stopped raining.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.921
What time is it, Mark?

29:53.359 --> 29:55.425
My watch stopped
when it got wet.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.095
(coughing)

30:04.303 --> 30:06.703
(straining)

30:10.376 --> 30:11.642
Stop.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.343
Maybe we need more boys.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.213
There's nothing to
push us against her.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.548
What?

30:17.549 --> 30:18.882
There's nothing to push on,
no leverage, dummy.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.784
Waller:
<i> What'd you call me?</i>

30:20.786 --> 30:21.885
I knew this wouldn't work.

30:21.887 --> 30:23.053
It's not a kayak.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.088
Why don't you shut
your pie hole, Vern?

30:25.090 --> 30:26.356
Arthur:
<i> Boys.</i>

30:36.135 --> 30:38.268
<i> You boys get back</i>
<i> on the boat.</i>

30:38.270 --> 30:41.505
<i> Mr. Butcher, we can't</i>
<i> break the water seal.</i>

30:42.508 --> 30:44.608
We don't have paddles, anyway.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.510
Gee, Vernon, always
with the obvious.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.847
Can't the boys back
at camp do something?

30:49.849 --> 30:51.949
Vernon:
<i> They probably think</i>
<i> we're safe on land.</i>

30:53.953 --> 30:55.219
Come on.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.223
If we overload (mumbles).

31:04.296 --> 31:06.630
How long can these
boys stay immersed?

31:08.067 --> 31:09.366
Another hour.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.638
The water gets colder
the deeper the body is.

31:17.276 --> 31:18.375
The higher the body,

31:18.377 --> 31:20.010
the less heat you'll lose!

31:20.012 --> 31:21.078
<i> Come on, boys,</i>

31:21.080 --> 31:22.579
<i> keep yourselves up!</i>

31:24.116 --> 31:25.515
We'll take shifts,

31:25.517 --> 31:26.984
on and off the hull.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.921
It's not the water
I'm concerned about.

31:31.223 --> 31:34.124
(mumbling) Joseph had a
piano recital coming up.

31:44.837 --> 31:47.537
We need to make our
way to Grand Island.

31:49.842 --> 31:51.041
It's that way.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.180
Mr. Lambden,

31:58.617 --> 32:00.517
please, we have to try.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.689
Everybody stern.

32:05.691 --> 32:06.757
What?

32:06.759 --> 32:08.258
Robert:
<i> You heard Mr. Lambden.</i>

32:10.496 --> 32:11.995
We can do this.

32:16.335 --> 32:17.334
<i> Leonard?</i>

32:21.140 --> 32:22.606
This is a bad idea.

33:05.617 --> 33:06.883
Will:
<i> Jack.</i>

33:10.489 --> 33:11.788
Jack?

33:14.226 --> 33:15.492
What?

33:20.632 --> 33:22.332
Oh for chrissake, Will.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.374
Jack:
<i> Ah, the water's freezing.</i>

33:37.716 --> 33:39.616
Will:
<i> Thanks for taking care of me.</i>

33:40.285 --> 33:41.551
<i> You're</i>

33:43.322 --> 33:44.588
<i> like a dad.</i>

33:45.190 --> 33:46.456
Jesus, Will.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.359
I'm not our goddamn father.

33:51.063 --> 33:53.030
You're what I
imagine he would be.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.632
Don't say that.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.302
He was a soldier.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.638
He got shot.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.074
Will:
<i> But that made him a hero.</i>

34:06.979 --> 34:08.211
It didn't.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.184
Will:
<i> Jack?</i>

34:15.754 --> 34:17.454
<i> Why wasn't he a hero?</i>

34:20.592 --> 34:22.659
He was shot by his
commanding officer.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.929
What?

34:27.399 --> 34:28.665
Why?

34:30.969 --> 34:32.469
Why do you think?

34:45.851 --> 34:47.150
Vernon:
<i> Wake up.</i>

34:47.719 --> 34:51.388

¶ Wake up, wake up,

Come on in.

Waller:
<i> Who's the first one</i>
<i> to give me twenty?</i>

35:42.541 --> 35:43.740
(indiscernible chatter)

Okay, okay, okay.

36:19.244 --> 36:23.213
(upbeat jazz music)

36:23.215 --> 36:24.481
And, go.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.250
Go, go, Will!

36:27.252 --> 36:31.121
(boys shouting encouragement)

Mark?

37:34.953 --> 37:36.286
Is he dead?

37:36.288 --> 37:37.520
Let me do it.

37:37.522 --> 37:39.022
Prop me up.

37:46.798 --> 37:51.701
(Arthur grunting)

37:52.037 --> 37:53.303
(sputtering)

37:55.574 --> 37:57.173
You all right, (mumbles)?

37:57.175 --> 37:58.575
Vernon:
<i> You're all right,</i>
<i> you're okay.</i>

37:58.577 --> 37:59.576
<i> You can get through</i>

37:59.578 --> 38:00.844
Robert:
<i> Leonard?</i>

38:01.413 --> 38:02.879
We need you in the water.

38:03.482 --> 38:04.648
What?

38:04.650 --> 38:05.682
Mark can't go in the water.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.017
We need you in the water.

38:07.019 --> 38:08.318
It's okay.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.855
I-I can't, I can't.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.523
Don't be a cry-baby.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.524
It won't be long.

38:14.526 --> 38:15.792
We'll take shifts.

38:16.128 --> 38:17.794
My father drowned.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.696
Waller:
<i> Mark's gonna drown,</i>
<i> ya sissy!</i>

38:19.698 --> 38:20.964
Waller.

38:27.472 --> 38:33.076
(gentle peaceful music)

38:33.078 --> 38:36.146
¶

38:36.148 --> 38:39.215
Can anyone tell me why
migrating birds fly in a V?

38:40.686 --> 38:41.985
What?

38:44.256 --> 38:45.522
Gordon?

38:45.924 --> 38:47.590
Gordon:
<i> Aerodynamics.</i>

38:47.592 --> 38:50.126
The bird rides the updraft
caused by the flapping wings

38:50.128 --> 38:51.594
of the bird in front of it.

38:52.964 --> 38:56.866
So, there's no benefit
to being the first bird.

38:57.869 --> 39:00.070
Gordon:
<i> There's no</i>
<i> aerodynamic advantage.</i>

39:00.072 --> 39:02.272
So how does it make
it the whole trip?

39:02.274 --> 39:03.540
They switch.

39:04.376 --> 39:06.042
They take turns being leader.

39:07.112 --> 39:11.114
(breathing heavily)

39:20.559 --> 39:24.160
I think I'll trade
places with Mark.

39:24.162 --> 39:25.695
Mark?

39:25.697 --> 39:26.996
Let's switch places
with Leonard.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.465
Mark:
<i> Yes, Mr. Lambden.</i>

39:34.206 --> 39:35.605
Boy:
<i> Come on, Mark.</i>

39:36.441 --> 39:42.812

39:51.223 --> 39:52.489
Waller:
<i> Wait.</i>

39:53.258 --> 39:54.624
What are you doing?

39:54.626 --> 39:56.259
Leonard,

39:56.261 --> 39:57.961
<i> that was very brave.</i>

39:59.931 --> 40:01.197
Take this.

40:02.167 --> 40:03.466
<i> Go on.</i>

40:03.468 --> 40:04.768
<i> Take it.</i>

40:04.770 --> 40:06.870
<i> When this is all over,</i>

40:06.872 --> 40:08.204
it's yours to keep.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.506
Thank you.

40:13.044 --> 40:15.178
Robert, get on the boat.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.679
No, I'm dead weight.

40:18.316 --> 40:20.016
<i> I'm sinking the canoe.</i>

40:20.018 --> 40:21.317
What?

40:21.319 --> 40:23.219
I'm a hindrance
to the others.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.957
These boys need their leader.

40:30.629 --> 40:33.196
They have their leader.

40:38.737 --> 40:39.836
You're not gonna

40:39.838 --> 40:41.738
make it out
there with
your knee.

40:44.342 --> 40:45.608
Take this.

40:50.215 --> 40:51.481
Don't.

40:59.357 --> 41:02.592
If you think that
I fought for my,

41:02.594 --> 41:04.127
my country for
glory and honour,

41:04.129 --> 41:05.595
you'd be wrong.

<i> man beside me.</i>

41:09.501 --> 41:11.935
<i> Behind me, in front of me.</i>

41:13.104 --> 41:16.172
<i> He</i> is what makes a
soldier do what he must.

41:17.676 --> 41:19.576
Will you remember that?

41:20.479 --> 41:21.744
Yes.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.722
(sputtering)

41:43.268 --> 41:46.069

41:46.071 --> 41:47.303
Will:
<i> What's happening?</i>

41:47.305 --> 41:48.872
<i> Is he coming back?</i>

<i> What the fuck?</i>

43:49.661 --> 43:51.060
Arthur:
<i> Mark, Mark?</i>

43:51.062 --> 43:52.228
Stay awake.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.464
Mark:
<i> Sure thing, Mr. Butcher.</i>

43:56.901 --> 43:58.034
Leonard?

43:58.036 --> 43:59.869
<i> Give me the compass.</i>

43:59.871 --> 44:01.204
I dropped it.

44:03.074 --> 44:05.241
Who knows where we capsized?

44:05.243 --> 44:07.410
<i> You, on the end.</i>

44:07.412 --> 44:08.444
What's your name?

44:08.446 --> 44:10.179
You know my name.

44:10.181 --> 44:11.781
Your name.

44:11.783 --> 44:13.583
Ray Allen.

44:14.686 --> 44:15.952
Arthur:
<i> Address.</i>

44:17.122 --> 44:19.188
100 Old Norwood Road.

44:20.392 --> 44:22.025
Do you know where we capsized?

44:22.027 --> 44:23.493
I don't know.

44:26.364 --> 44:28.564
It was right after
we entered the narrows.

44:28.566 --> 44:29.632
Here.

44:29.634 --> 44:31.134
Vernon:
<i> Let me see.</i>

44:38.610 --> 44:40.309
Grand Island was
on our right.

44:41.112 --> 44:42.779
Who can find the Plough?

44:42.781 --> 44:44.047
Gordon?

44:44.683 --> 44:45.915
Gordon:
<i> There.</i>

44:45.917 --> 44:47.283
Waller:
<i> What are you doing?</i>

44:47.285 --> 44:48.651
Arthur:
<i> Finding north.</i>

44:48.653 --> 44:50.953
<i> Take the last two</i>
<i> stars of the Bowl</i>

44:50.955 --> 44:52.622
<i> and draw a line directly.</i>

44:52.624 --> 44:53.890
The North Star.

44:55.427 --> 44:56.893
Indian Point is north.

44:57.629 --> 44:58.828
Let's keep paddling.

44:58.830 --> 45:00.530
Vernon:
<i> It didn't work before.</i>

45:01.199 --> 45:02.732
We have more light now.

45:02.734 --> 45:04.801
<i> Waller, get back in the water.</i>

45:04.803 --> 45:06.703
<i> Leonard, get back on top.</i>

45:07.405 --> 45:09.639
(dramatic instrumental)

45:09.641 --> 45:11.207
Arthur:
<i> Come on, Ray.</i>

45:11.209 --> 45:12.408
Yeah.

45:12.410 --> 45:19.315
(dramatic instrumental)

45:19.317 --> 45:21.250
Arthur:
<i> Keep out of the water.</i>

45:21.252 --> 45:24.320
<i> Get his face out</i>
<i> of the water.</i>

45:24.322 --> 45:25.488
<i> Keep his head up.</i>

45:25.490 --> 45:27.390
<i> Keep kicking, boys.</i>

45:27.392 --> 45:28.758
<i> Keep kicking.</i>

45:28.760 --> 45:33.496
(dramatic music swelling)

45:33.498 --> 45:35.832
¶

45:35.834 --> 45:37.333
Oliver:
<i> Hey, what's that?</i>

45:40.004 --> 45:41.504
It's just a deadhead.

45:42.974 --> 45:44.440
Oliver:
<i> What's a deadhead?</i>

45:45.276 --> 45:48.111
It's an old log that
probably broke away

45:48.113 --> 45:49.545
from a boom a while back.

45:49.547 --> 45:51.781
Gordon:
<i> It gets so waterlogged</i>
<i> that it floats vertically.</i>

45:54.986 --> 45:56.886
So what's your story, Oliver?

45:56.888 --> 45:59.789
Uh, I'm a payroll clerk
at Wrigley's.

46:00.125 --> 46:01.190
Arthur:
<i> A solid job.</i>

46:01.192 --> 46:02.191
Yeah.

46:02.193 --> 46:03.760
It makes me popular.

46:03.762 --> 46:05.027
Arthur:
<i> Yeah.</i>

46:06.364 --> 46:08.831
Well, thank you.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.368
I'm saving up to
go to Europe.

46:13.004 --> 46:14.937
To visit your dad's grave.

46:14.939 --> 46:16.272
Oliver:
<i> He made it back all right,</i>

46:16.274 --> 46:19.909
but he died in the epidemic.

46:19.911 --> 46:21.177
I was nine.

46:26.718 --> 46:33.890
(groaning)

46:33.892 --> 46:35.225
Arthur:
<i> Okay.</i>

46:35.226 --> 46:36.559
Waller:
<i> Get it out, get it out,</i>
<i> get it out.</i>

46:36.561 --> 46:37.860
Tackle box.

46:38.363 --> 46:40.463
Fetch the first aid kit.

46:40.465 --> 46:41.964
It's not important.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.966
Pliers.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.635
There you go, boy.

46:45.637 --> 46:48.237
(muffled screaming)

46:48.239 --> 46:49.705
Ray, hold him.

46:51.976 --> 46:55.044
(muffled screaming)

46:56.948 --> 46:58.414
Arthur:
<i> There you go.</i>

46:59.784 --> 47:01.384
Sticky plaster?

47:01.386 --> 47:02.652
Oliver:
<i> Here.</i>

47:03.321 --> 47:05.555
It's okay, there you go.

47:05.557 --> 47:07.056
Give me your finger.

47:07.559 --> 47:08.891
There you go.

47:08.893 --> 47:09.992
Waller:
<i> Ha.</i>

47:09.994 --> 47:11.427
How'd you know how to do that?

47:11.429 --> 47:13.462
You can't go back.

47:13.464 --> 47:15.164
You have to go through.

47:23.741 --> 47:27.910
<i> (boys whimpering)</i>

47:27.912 --> 47:30.980
<i> (grunting)</i>

47:32.317 --> 47:33.683
Jack:
<i> I can't see Indian Point.</i>

47:33.685 --> 47:35.585
Vernon:
<i> The wind's turning</i>
<i> us southeast.</i>

47:35.887 --> 47:37.653
Arthur:
<i> Keep moving, boys.</i>

47:37.655 --> 47:38.754
Vernon:
<i> This is useless!</i>

47:38.756 --> 47:39.755
Waller:
<i> You have a better idea?</i>

47:39.757 --> 47:40.756
Vernon:
<i> We're wasting energy.</i>

47:40.758 --> 47:41.824
Arthur:
<i> Just five more minutes.</i>

47:41.826 --> 47:43.092
Mark's dead.

47:44.562 --> 47:45.661
Stop.

47:45.663 --> 47:46.896
Ray:
<i> Mark?</i>

47:46.898 --> 47:49.065
Oh, my God,
he's not breathing.

47:50.902 --> 47:52.168
Mark.

47:57.542 --> 47:59.008
No, no.

48:01.813 --> 48:03.079
Arthur:
<i> Mark?</i>

48:10.555 --> 48:11.787
No.

48:22.467 --> 48:23.833
Vernon:
<i> Hey wait, wait.</i>

48:23.835 --> 48:25.167
Mark said Will can
have his watch.

48:25.169 --> 48:26.602
What?

48:26.604 --> 48:28.671
It might still work,
if it dries.

48:29.540 --> 48:30.673
I-I don't want it.

48:30.675 --> 48:31.807
I'll take it off.

48:31.809 --> 48:33.009
He doesn't want it.

48:33.011 --> 48:34.911
It's for his parents.

48:54.565 --> 48:56.732
<i> Ray, take his place.</i>

49:02.740 --> 49:04.140
Teach us, O Lord,

49:04.142 --> 49:05.274
true brotherhood,

49:05.276 --> 49:07.777
in daily thought and deed.

49:07.779 --> 49:10.012
(in unison) That we may
tread with humble heart,

49:10.014 --> 49:12.381
the path where
Thou dost lead.

49:12.383 --> 49:15.051
Love then shall reign
supreme over all,

49:15.053 --> 49:17.753
over heart and
mind and hand.

49:17.755 --> 49:20.056
Eternal love and brotherhood.

49:20.058 --> 49:21.791
In all this storm tossed-

49:21.793 --> 49:22.892
Fuck!

49:22.894 --> 49:23.893
<i> What are we doing?</i>

49:23.895 --> 49:25.411
Arthur:
<i> Waller.</i>

49:25.412 --> 49:26.928
Thanks, Ray, but praying's
not going to help Mark.

49:26.931 --> 49:28.130
<i> It's not gonna save us.</i>

49:28.132 --> 49:29.131
<i> We can't right the canoe.</i>

49:29.133 --> 49:30.299
<i> We got no paddles.</i>

49:30.301 --> 49:31.934
Arthur:
<i> You're scaring</i>
<i> the younger kids.</i>

49:31.936 --> 49:33.769
(crying) I'm gonna drown.

49:33.771 --> 49:36.272
We can't do anything
until we see the shore.

49:36.274 --> 49:37.406
I'll swim to shore.

49:37.408 --> 49:38.474
Even if you guessed
the right way,

49:38.476 --> 49:40.343
there's no light to swim to.

49:40.345 --> 49:42.078
But didn't Mr. Butcher
swim to shore?

49:42.080 --> 49:43.145
Waller:
<i> You know what?</i>
<i> Go, Ray.</i>

49:43.147 --> 49:44.146
<i> It's better than praying.</i>

49:44.148 --> 49:45.581
Why not do something useful?

49:45.583 --> 49:47.917
No one's going anywhere
by themselves.

49:47.919 --> 49:49.418
<i> As a team maybe.</i>

49:49.420 --> 49:50.920
<i> But not you, Ray.</i>

49:50.922 --> 49:52.355
I see a light.

49:53.024 --> 49:54.190
Momma?

49:54.192 --> 49:55.491
Wait.
-<i> Momma?</i>

49:55.960 --> 49:56.959
Ray!
-Momma.

49:56.961 --> 49:58.761
Momma, Momma?
-Ray!

49:58.763 --> 50:00.429
Momma, Momma?
Arthur:<i> Ray.</i>

50:00.431 --> 50:01.897
He won't make it.

50:02.467 --> 50:03.466
Momma.
Arthur:<i> Ray.</i>

50:03.468 --> 50:04.700
Ray:
<i> Momma.</i>

50:04.702 --> 50:06.569
Will:
<i> No, please don't leave us.</i>

50:06.571 --> 50:07.737
No, please!

50:07.739 --> 50:09.038
Ray!
-Momma.

50:09.507 --> 50:10.840
Momma.

50:10.842 --> 50:12.408
<i> Momma.</i>

50:12.410 --> 50:13.909
Arthur:
<i> Ray, come back here!</i>

50:15.213 --> 50:16.712
<i> Ray, come back here.</i>

50:17.248 --> 50:21.017
(gentle instrumental)

50:21.019 --> 50:22.284
Ray:
<i> Momma?</i>

50:22.687 --> 50:23.953
<i> Momma.</i>

50:25.690 --> 50:32.762
(water splashing)
(soft instrumental)

50:46.644 --> 50:47.810
You're the one who
made him leave.

50:47.812 --> 50:49.412
I didn't tell him
to swim away.

50:49.414 --> 50:50.546
He just wanted
him to wise up.

50:50.548 --> 50:51.947
Well if you didn't egg him on,

50:51.949 --> 50:53.549
he wouldn't have swam off.

50:53.551 --> 50:54.550
Leonard:
<i> He still might make it,</i>

50:54.552 --> 50:56.585
even if it's the wrong shore.

50:56.587 --> 50:58.320
He could hike back to camp
and tell them what happened.

50:58.322 --> 50:59.989
What are they gonna do?
They don't have a canoe.

50:59.991 --> 51:01.957
Go to Fenelon?
Tell the police?

51:01.959 --> 51:03.459
Waller:
<i> Walk all night in darkness?</i>

51:03.461 --> 51:05.428
Vernon:
<i> It's probably a mile to shore.</i>
<i> He'll never make it.</i>

51:24.315 --> 51:25.781
Mr. Lambden's back.

51:26.050 --> 51:27.550
Will:
<i> What about Ray?</i>

51:37.161 --> 51:39.395
I need a volunteer to
swim to the Indian Point.

51:39.397 --> 51:40.830
You said no one's
going anywhere.

51:40.832 --> 51:42.565
Arthur:
<i> Yeah, not alone, with me.</i>

51:42.567 --> 51:43.966
Vernon's the best swimmer.

51:43.968 --> 51:45.468
What? No, no, no way.

51:45.470 --> 51:47.002
I'll go alone if I have to.

51:47.004 --> 51:48.370
Fine.

51:48.372 --> 51:50.840
Oliver:
<i> Mr. Butcher left</i>
<i> you in charge.</i>

51:50.842 --> 51:51.841
I'll go with Vernon, we-

51:51.843 --> 51:52.908
No, go by yourself!

51:52.910 --> 51:54.577
Because swimming out
there is suicide.

51:54.579 --> 51:55.778
You're a pussy.

51:55.780 --> 51:57.346
I can't swim straight in this.

51:57.348 --> 51:59.014
I can't follow a goddamn star!

51:59.016 --> 52:00.216
Or I'll push you off.

52:00.218 --> 52:01.550
Waller!

52:03.421 --> 52:04.687
Whoa.

52:05.923 --> 52:07.490
What the fuck?

52:07.492 --> 52:08.491
What do you think,

52:08.493 --> 52:09.658
you're some kinda tough guy?

52:09.660 --> 52:10.793
You're just a kid.

52:10.795 --> 52:12.895
When are you gonna grow up?

52:12.897 --> 52:14.263
I don't know what to do!

52:15.399 --> 52:16.732
You're the strongest,

52:16.734 --> 52:18.234
you have the most influence.

52:18.236 --> 52:20.302
That makes you my
second in command.

52:20.304 --> 52:23.639
Your attitude can
save us or sink us.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.141
So what's it gonna be?

52:25.676 --> 52:28.277
(muffled screaming)

52:28.279 --> 52:31.013
Do you hear how
scared they are?

52:32.483 --> 52:35.317
(muffled screaming)

52:38.156 --> 52:40.256
<i> Oliver!</i>
<i> -Oliver!</i>

52:40.258 --> 52:41.724
Will:
<i> Oliver swam away.</i>

52:42.293 --> 52:43.559
He went that way.

52:45.296 --> 52:46.562
Arthur:
<i> Oliver?</i>

52:47.165 --> 52:48.430
<i> Oliver!</i>

52:49.934 --> 52:51.400
What'd he say to you?

52:54.739 --> 52:56.038
Oliver!

52:56.507 --> 52:57.773
Oliver?

52:58.009 --> 52:59.275
Oliver?

53:06.817 --> 53:08.117
<i> Oliver!</i>

53:15.693 --> 53:17.893
I killed Joe and Frank.

53:17.895 --> 53:19.161
What?

53:22.099 --> 53:23.599
I messed up the stroke.

53:24.769 --> 53:26.669
It was a wave that
blew us over.

53:27.605 --> 53:29.205
(crying) I caused
the accident.

53:29.207 --> 53:30.472
Jack:
<i> Don't say that.</i>

53:34.612 --> 53:36.445
It was Butcher's fault.

53:36.447 --> 53:37.446
What, Vern?

53:37.448 --> 53:38.614
I said it was
Mr. Butcher's fault.

53:38.616 --> 53:40.216
Waller:
<i> You dope, what do you know?</i>

53:40.218 --> 53:41.684
There were too many boys.

53:42.420 --> 53:44.253
<i> We set out too late.</i>

53:44.255 --> 53:46.388
His whole trip was balled up.

53:47.258 --> 53:48.924
We should have had
cushions or cork.

53:48.926 --> 53:50.326
Then why didn't
you say anything?

53:50.328 --> 53:52.127
Because I know how
to swim, Waller.

53:52.129 --> 53:53.395
You son of a bitch.

53:54.232 --> 53:55.831
Will:
<i> Stop!</i>

53:55.833 --> 53:57.333
Waller, you're making
everything worse!

53:58.803 --> 54:01.937
(breathing heavily)

54:09.547 --> 54:10.813
Arthur:
<i> Oliver!</i>

54:13.884 --> 54:15.184
Hey.

54:15.453 --> 54:17.586
(coughs)

54:27.031 --> 54:36.472
(distant bells ringing)

54:36.474 --> 54:38.540
Robert:
<i> Why'd you join</i>
<i> the Brotherhood?</i>

54:41.279 --> 54:42.544
I had a son.

54:43.581 --> 54:45.047
He died in the epidemic.

54:49.420 --> 54:50.419
He would have liked it here.

54:50.421 --> 54:51.687
He loved to fish.

54:54.525 --> 54:56.759
<i> Oh, here's a list of</i>
<i> the boys for the trip.</i>

54:59.864 --> 55:01.897
<i> Some of them were hoping</i>
<i> that the tuck shop</i>

55:01.899 --> 55:04.300
would be playing the
Sam 'n Henry Show.

55:06.570 --> 55:08.203
Beg your pardon?

55:08.205 --> 55:09.672
It's a radio show.

55:13.911 --> 55:16.178
The point of all of this,
Mr. Lambden,

55:16.180 --> 55:18.347
is to get them as far away
from electrical sockets

55:18.349 --> 55:19.982
as possible.

55:19.984 --> 55:22.851
You're not one for
modernity, I understand.

55:22.853 --> 55:25.688
I think electrical things
put us further from ourselves.

55:25.690 --> 55:27.089
Hi, Mr. Lambden!

55:32.830 --> 55:35.698
I heard you pulled a
thorn from the lion's paw.

55:35.700 --> 55:37.599
Just some old
Boy Scout know-how.

55:39.270 --> 55:40.769
You gained some respect.

55:41.706 --> 55:43.172
Not an easy thing to do.

55:50.214 --> 55:53.115
You're not gonna make me
chop down a tree, are you?

55:53.884 --> 55:54.950
If he wasn't chopping
down a tree,

55:54.952 --> 55:56.552
he'd be at the nickel craps.

55:56.554 --> 55:57.820
He'd be a rum-runner.

55:58.622 --> 56:00.122
He could have hurt himself.

56:01.459 --> 56:04.193
Risk builds character,
Mr. Lambden.

56:04.195 --> 56:05.728
Challenge builds character.

56:06.697 --> 56:08.197
So can-
-This is a leadership camp.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.299
Not a holiday.

56:26.450 --> 56:28.917
(restrained sobs)

56:39.296 --> 56:40.763
Come with me. Now.

56:46.003 --> 56:48.470
We can't go back, only through.

56:54.945 --> 57:00.349
(sombre instrumental)

57:00.351 --> 57:06.188
¶

57:06.190 --> 57:07.189
Will:
<i> Mr. Lambden!</i>

57:07.191 --> 57:08.190
Leonard:
<i> Waller!</i>

57:08.192 --> 57:09.191
Mr. Lambden.
-Waller, right here.

57:09.193 --> 57:10.492
Jack:
<i> Waller.</i>

57:10.494 --> 57:11.693
<i> Over here.</i>

57:18.436 --> 57:20.269
Did you see Oliver?

57:20.271 --> 57:21.904
Waller:
<i> Yeah, we saw him but he was-</i>

57:21.906 --> 57:23.405
way ahead of us.

57:23.407 --> 57:25.240
Man, he looked strong.

57:25.242 --> 57:27.309
<i> He was slicing through the</i>
<i> water like it was nothing.</i>

57:29.146 --> 57:31.113
Leonard:
<i> You should have gone</i>
<i> with him, Vern.</i>

57:31.115 --> 57:32.581
I hope he makes it.

57:38.122 --> 57:39.855
Will, Leonard,

57:39.857 --> 57:41.256
take out your shoelaces.

57:41.258 --> 57:42.324
Why?

57:42.326 --> 57:43.625
Because I said so,
Willy Killjoy.

57:43.627 --> 57:44.626
<i> Come on.</i>

57:44.628 --> 57:45.894
Yes, sir.

57:47.665 --> 57:49.832
We've decided we're not
gonna send anyone else.

57:49.834 --> 57:52.334
<i> We're gonna stick together,</i>
<i> wait till we can see.</i>

57:53.304 --> 57:54.536
<i> Leonard?</i>

57:54.538 --> 57:56.238
Make me a slipknot
with the lace.

57:57.875 --> 57:59.475
Will, can you make
me a figure eight?

57:59.477 --> 58:00.843
All right.

58:00.845 --> 58:02.244
Waller:
<i> If you get stuck,</i>

58:02.246 --> 58:03.712
me or Mr. Lambden will help.

58:04.748 --> 58:06.648
<i> Gordon, slide up on the hull,</i>

58:06.650 --> 58:08.217
<i> there's no sense</i>
<i> freezing there.</i>

58:08.219 --> 58:09.518
Thanks, Waller.

58:12.056 --> 58:13.722
Anyone know a song to sing?

58:13.724 --> 58:15.224
Something from choir?

58:15.993 --> 58:17.259
Something dirty.

58:20.498 --> 58:24.500
¶ Tickling the
ivories on the organ

58:24.502 --> 58:28.403
¶ Running my fingers
up and down the keys

58:28.405 --> 58:30.072

a real kidney cracker

58:39.750 --> 58:41.550
¶ A major bobble whacker

58:41.552 --> 58:43.819
¶ For a salty cracker

58:43.821 --> 58:47.623

59:19.456 --> 59:20.722
Captain, my captain.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.457
We'll be back in the morning.

59:22.459 --> 59:24.159
Bring me a shaved cherry ice.

59:24.895 --> 59:26.161
It'll melt.

59:26.297 --> 59:27.796
Paddle fast then.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.365
Would you mind

59:31.835 --> 59:34.469
making some copies of this?

59:36.540 --> 59:37.839
Looks good.

59:38.475 --> 59:39.942
Might not sound good.

59:43.347 --> 59:44.646
<i> All right, boys.</i>

59:44.648 --> 59:47.082
Come on, Joseph,
you missed the photo!

59:48.385 --> 59:50.285
Why are we heading
out so late?

59:50.287 --> 59:52.788
Geez, Vernon, you got
something to say, say it.

Hey.

1:00:21.952 --> 1:00:23.452
Do you remember Hamm Smith?

1:00:26.957 --> 1:00:29.224
I don't know who that is.

1:00:29.226 --> 1:00:31.126
Oh, Hamm Smith,
you remember him.

1:00:32.229 --> 1:00:33.695
Such a queer fellow.

Who you talkin' about, Vern?

1:00:37.801 --> 1:00:39.368

1:00:39.370 --> 1:00:40.836
Conserve your energy, Vernon.

remembers Hamm Smith.

1:08:39.916 --> 1:08:41.182
Dad was-

1:08:43.353 --> 1:08:46.020
He was part of the creeping
barrage that went up Vimy.

1:08:48.458 --> 1:08:51.392

<i> He wasn't conscripted.</i>

1:09:46.082 --> 1:09:47.782

1:12:39.756 --> 1:12:41.255
All right.

¶

1:14:13.283 --> 1:14:17.351
(breathing heavily)

1:14:22.992 --> 1:14:24.258
Wake up.

1:14:31.634 --> 1:14:33.100
A paddle washed up.

1:14:33.837 --> 1:14:35.536
Will:
<i> Is this Grand Island?</i>

1:14:42.312 --> 1:14:43.478
Wake up.

1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:44.479
Leonard.

1:14:44.481 --> 1:14:46.547
What are we gonna do
with only one paddle?

1:14:57.494 --> 1:14:58.759
I'm hungry.

1:14:59.896 --> 1:15:01.229
Me too.

1:15:03.566 --> 1:15:05.933
There's gotta be a
homestead somewhere.

1:15:05.935 --> 1:15:07.335
I'll go with you.

1:15:07.337 --> 1:15:08.836
No, stay with the boys.

1:15:09.839 --> 1:15:11.539
Better stay in pairs,
I'd say.

1:15:16.546 --> 1:15:17.812
Leonard?

1:15:18.147 --> 1:15:20.147
<i> Look along the shore,</i>

1:15:20.148 --> 1:15:22.148
<i> see if you can find something</i>
<i> that we can use as a paddle.</i>

1:15:26.956 --> 1:15:29.223
What if you can't find food?

1:15:29.225 --> 1:15:30.691
Then we'll pick berries.

1:15:35.665 --> 1:15:41.569
(gentle instrumental)

1:15:41.571 --> 1:15:44.639
¶

1:16:09.799 --> 1:16:14.802
(breathing heavily)

1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:19.307
I need a minute.

1:16:24.514 --> 1:16:25.980
Waller:
<i> I have to piss.</i>

1:16:31.087 --> 1:16:40.161
(breathing heavily)

1:16:57.347 --> 1:17:01.248
(stifled sobbing)

1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:20.568
He gave me his
spot on the canoe.

1:17:24.307 --> 1:17:26.340
My own father wouldn't
have done that.

1:17:30.813 --> 1:17:32.913
It was his fault,
wasn't it?

1:18:02.445 --> 1:18:08.949
(sombre instrumental)

1:18:08.951 --> 1:18:10.618
Leonard:
<i> First thing's first, Will.</i>

1:18:10.953 --> 1:18:13.754
(sneezing)

1:18:13.756 --> 1:18:15.022
Leonard:
<i> Goddammit.</i>

1:18:20.897 --> 1:18:22.596
<i> We'll eat,</i>

1:18:22.598 --> 1:18:24.632
<i> then we'll have the</i>
<i> strength to paddle back.</i>

1:18:24.634 --> 1:18:28.169
<i> And then the adults will tell</i>
<i> us what to do, all right?</i>

1:18:28.638 --> 1:18:29.704
<i> Will?</i>

1:18:31.908 --> 1:18:33.174
Will!

1:18:33.910 --> 1:18:35.342
Will!

1:18:35.344 --> 1:18:36.610
He's older.

1:18:37.647 --> 1:18:39.113
<i> Where are you going?</i>

1:18:40.149 --> 1:18:41.415
He's stronger.

1:18:43.986 --> 1:18:46.554
We don't get to decide
who lives and dies, Will.

1:18:53.629 --> 1:18:57.898
There might be boys marooned on
the island or on the shores,

1:18:59.302 --> 1:19:01.368
but we won't know
unless we get back.

1:19:02.538 --> 1:19:03.804
Will:
<i> No.</i>

1:19:05.441 --> 1:19:06.707
<i> They're dead.</i>

1:19:10.079 --> 1:19:11.345
They're all dead.

1:19:17.019 --> 1:19:19.320
Leonard:
<i> Well your mom's not gonna</i>
<i> want two dead sons.</i>

1:19:22.925 --> 1:19:24.992
Come help me look
for wood, Will.

1:19:30.066 --> 1:19:32.199
(exhales)

Waller:
<i> You don't believe in God,</i>
<i> do you?</i>

1:20:14.544 --> 1:20:16.777
Arthur:
<i> Let's just say I've</i>
<i> had a crisis of faith.</i>

1:20:18.581 --> 1:20:20.347
I'd only been back from
Europe a few months

1:20:20.349 --> 1:20:22.049
when the Spanish flu hit.

1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:25.920
My wife got sick.

1:20:28.457 --> 1:20:30.825
And died quickly, mercifully.

1:20:30.827 --> 1:20:34.061
Benjamin soldiered through.

1:20:36.999 --> 1:20:38.265
For a while.

1:20:40.536 --> 1:20:43.103
Sometimes boys are more
resilient than men.

1:20:46.542 --> 1:20:48.042
How did you survive?

1:20:51.981 --> 1:20:53.247
I didn't get sick.

1:20:55.718 --> 1:20:57.218
I was the carrier.

1:21:02.058 --> 1:21:04.658
(sniffs)

1:21:04.660 --> 1:21:07.294
Arthur:
<i> We were in, uh,</i>
<i> close quarters.</i>

1:21:09.632 --> 1:21:11.465
Unsanitary conditions.

1:21:13.603 --> 1:21:17.104
When we came back infected,
we didn't know.

1:21:19.408 --> 1:21:20.908
<i> We were weapons.</i>

1:21:24.046 --> 1:21:25.512
I killed them.

1:21:27.817 --> 1:21:29.149
No.

1:21:29.151 --> 1:21:31.285
Millions of people died,
Mr. Lambden.

1:21:33.656 --> 1:21:35.656
But what about
those eight boys?

1:21:36.492 --> 1:21:38.192
At the bottom of the lake.

1:21:39.662 --> 1:21:41.161
What about them?

1:21:42.899 --> 1:21:45.432
That ain't your fault, either.

1:21:45.434 --> 1:21:46.901
I keep on surviving.

1:21:51.307 --> 1:21:53.274
(sniffing)

1:21:53.276 --> 1:21:54.742
You saved us.

1:22:05.388 --> 1:22:11.191

Canon Rutherford:

1:23:51.627 --> 1:23:54.028
You take the other motor
to the Rosedale docks.

1:23:55.097 --> 1:23:56.096
If you hadn't come-

1:23:56.098 --> 1:23:57.264
Come now.

1:23:57.266 --> 1:23:58.532
Let's make a move.

<i> On top of the spire,</i>

1:25:07.970 --> 1:25:09.870
<i> there was a tremendous statue.</i>

1:25:11.540 --> 1:25:13.540
<i> It had been damaged</i>
<i> by the shelling.</i>

1:25:14.643 --> 1:25:16.844
<i> It hung there at</i>
<i> a 45 degree angle.</i>

1:25:18.447 --> 1:25:20.180
<i> People said if it</i>
<i> fell from the spire,</i>

1:25:20.182 --> 1:25:21.682
<i> the Germans would win.</i>

1:25:23.319 --> 1:25:25.953
<i> But some French engineers</i>
<i> decided to fix fate.</i>

1:25:26.856 --> 1:25:30.057
<i> They installed a cable,</i>
<i> so it would remain secure.</i>

1:25:31.193 --> 1:25:32.860
<i> So it would not fall.</i>

1:25:32.862 --> 1:25:34.461

Robert:
<i> No, Arthur.</i>

1:25:49.645 --> 1:25:51.111
<i> You're the cable.</i>

1:25:58.587 --> 1:26:00.020
Canon Rutherford:
<i> Chief Coroner is here.</i>

1:26:00.022 --> 1:26:01.188
The police are here.

1:26:01.190 --> 1:26:02.489
The, uh-

1:26:03.025 --> 1:26:05.926
firemen have brought
grappling hooks.

<i> Our number one priority</i>

Will,

if you could take down
the flag, that'd be swell.

Yes, sir.
