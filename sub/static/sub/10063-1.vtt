It's our only chance!

Narrator: <i>It</i> is the year <i>2005.</i>

04:12.002 --> 04:13.753
<i>The treacherous Decepticons.</i>

04:13.754 --> 04:16.928
<i>Have conquered the Autobots'
home planet of Cybertron.</i>

04:22.804 --> 04:27.391
<i>But from secret staging grounds
on two of Cybertron's moons.</i>

04:27.392 --> 04:31.147
<i>The valiant Autobots prepare
to retake their homeland.</i>

04:43.325 --> 04:45.534
Ironhide, report to me at once.

04:45.535 --> 04:49.455
Every time I look into
a monitor, Prime,

04:49.456 --> 04:51.207
My circuits sizzle.

04:51.208 --> 04:55.503
When are we gonna
start busting Decepti-chops?

04:55.504 --> 04:59.590
I want you to make a special run
to Autobot City on Earth.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.134
- But, Prime...
- Listen, Ironhide,

05:02.135 --> 05:03.978
we don't have enough
Energon cubes

05:03.979 --> 05:06.388
to power a full-scale assault.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.808
Ready the shuttle for launch!

05:08.809 --> 05:12.029
Your days are numbered now,
Decepti-creeps.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.863
Jazz, report security status.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.865
No sign of Decepticons here,
Prime.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.659
What about Moonbase Two?

05:26.660 --> 05:30.961
Jazz to Moonbase Two.
Jazz to Moonbase Two.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.876
Bumblebee and Spike here.

05:33.877 --> 05:35.969
We're about to
send up a shuttle.

05:35.970 --> 05:38.754
Any Decepticon shenanigans
in your area?

05:38.755 --> 05:40.339
All clear, Jazz.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.592
Hey, Ironhide, tell my son
Daniel I miss him.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.427
And tell him not to worry.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.307
I'll be coming home as soon as
we've kicked Megatron's tail

05:48.308 --> 05:49.849
across the galaxy.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.642
Will do, Spike.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.770
Cliff jumper,
commence countdown.

05:54.771 --> 05:58.023
Five, four, three,

05:58.024 --> 06:00.442
two, one.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.615
Blastoff!

06:07.868 --> 06:12.965
Now, all we need is a little
Energon and a lot of luck.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.466
Laserbeak returns, Megatron.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.552
Welcome, Laserbeak.

06:26.553 --> 06:31.307
Unlike some of my other warriors,
you never fail me.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.977
Soundwave, play back
Laserbeak's findings

06:36.396 --> 06:38.774
As you command, Megatron.

06:41.526 --> 06:45.613
I want you to make a special run
to Autobot City on Earth.

06:45.614 --> 06:48.032
- But, Prime...
- Listen, Ironhide,

06:48.033 --> 06:50.161
We don't have enough
Energon cubes.

06:50.162 --> 06:52.661
To power a full-scale assault.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.705
Ready the shuttle for launch!

06:54.706 --> 06:59.543
Now, all we need is a little
Energon and a lot of luck.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.889
More than you imagine,
Optimus Prime.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.523
Megatron!

07:20.565 --> 07:21.941
Decepticons!

07:21.942 --> 07:23.910
Die, Autobots!

08:00.981 --> 08:04.608
This was almost too easy,
Starscream.

08:04.609 --> 08:10.656
Much easier, almighty Megatron,
than attacking the real threat...

08:10.657 --> 08:13.325
The Autobots' Moonbase.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.703
You're an idiot, Starscream.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.583
When we slip by their early
warning systems

08:18.584 --> 08:21.959
in their own shuttle
and destroy Autobot City,

08:21.960 --> 08:25.087
the Autobots
will be vanquished forever!

08:25.088 --> 08:26.214
No!

08:26.923 --> 08:29.802
Such heroic nonsense.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.606
Fish are jumping today,
huh, Danno?

08:44.607 --> 08:47.156
- I guess so.
- Hey, what's the matter?

08:47.157 --> 08:49.530
Oh, I don't know, Hot Rod.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.948
Come on, you can tell me.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.117
I guess I just miss my dad.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.961
Don't worry,
Spike'll be back soon.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.665
Oh, hey! I caught something!

09:02.625 --> 09:04.960
Wow! Look at the size of it!

09:04.961 --> 09:06.634
Yep, it's a whopper all right!

09:13.470 --> 09:16.724
Hot Rod, the shuttle's coming!
Let's watch it land!

09:16.725 --> 09:19.021
Talk about dull, Daniel.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.609
Hurry or we'll miss it!

09:40.538 --> 09:43.633
If you're gonna ride, Danno,
ride in style!

09:51.633 --> 09:53.135
Daniel: Hey, let's stop here!

09:53.136 --> 09:55.055
Why settle for a peek, Daniel,

09:55.056 --> 09:58.227
When you can see everything
from Lookout Mountain?

09:59.682 --> 10:02.561
A little to the left.
A little bit more.

10:11.444 --> 10:15.290
Turbo-revvin' young punk...
I'll straighten you out yet!

10:28.044 --> 10:30.923
Hot Rod, look!
There's a hole in the shuttle!

10:31.089 --> 10:32.089
What?!

10:34.008 --> 10:35.726
Decepticons!

10:40.932 --> 10:43.185
What's that darn fool doing?

10:48.273 --> 10:49.991
Attack!

10:52.318 --> 10:53.740
Daniel!

11:07.709 --> 11:10.212
Come on down, Autobrat!

11:34.819 --> 11:37.538
Huh, not bad for an old-timer.

11:38.156 --> 11:41.251
“Old-timer”?
That's something you'll never be

11:41.451 --> 11:42.771
if you don't get
back to the city.

11:42.827 --> 11:43.953
Save it, Kup!

11:45.371 --> 11:47.206
Let's burn rubber!

12:09.187 --> 12:11.772
Ultra Magnus,
a cursory evaluation

12:11.773 --> 12:13.318
of Decepticon capability

12:13.319 --> 12:15.910
indicates a distinct
tactical deficiency.

12:15.911 --> 12:17.819
In other words, Perceptor?

12:17.820 --> 12:19.822
We're outnumbered!

12:24.953 --> 12:28.044
Springer, you and Arcee
transform Autobot City.

12:28.045 --> 12:31.625
Perceptor, tell Blaster to radio
Prime for reinforcements.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.718
What about me, Magnus?
What about me? Huh? Huh? Huh?

12:33.719 --> 12:35.179
I can help. I wanna help.
What about me?

12:35.180 --> 12:36.885
Blurr, you can help me
alert the others.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.382
Absolutely, positively,
definitely.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.511
Nobody can get the job done
faster than I can. Nobody!

12:40.512 --> 12:42.970
Come on, Arcee, let's go!

12:42.971 --> 12:45.394
But Hot Rod and Kup
are still outside the city!

12:48.851 --> 12:50.102
We can't wait.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.652
They'll have to take care
of themselves. Come on!

13:13.918 --> 13:15.920
Pathetic fools!

13:16.129 --> 13:18.382
There's no escape!

13:26.306 --> 13:27.597
Oh!

13:32.228 --> 13:34.071
Ah! My foot!

13:56.002 --> 13:57.925
Breach their defenses!

14:03.926 --> 14:07.512
Mm, delicious. Eh, scrapmate?

14:07.513 --> 14:12.189
Er, a little heavy
on the electrons, Electron.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.151
Kup: The Insecticons
are in our way!

14:19.152 --> 14:21.448
Hot Rod: Wrong!
They're our way in!

14:21.449 --> 14:22.821
Yah!

14:38.378 --> 14:40.847
Look out and shout! Ow!

14:44.133 --> 14:47.603
Hey, Perceptor, what's shaking?
Other than this fortress?

14:47.604 --> 14:50.389
Blaster, Ultra Magnus
sends orders

14:50.390 --> 14:53.266
to contact Optimus Prime
on Moonbase One.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.362
All right,
cover your receptors, Perceptor!

15:02.610 --> 15:04.903
Optimus Prime, do you read me?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.451
The Decepticons
are blitzing Autobot City.

15:07.452 --> 15:09.494
We're really taking a pounding!

15:09.495 --> 15:11.870
Don't know how much longer
we can hold out.

15:11.871 --> 15:14.663
Soundwave,
jam that transmission!

15:14.664 --> 15:21.628
Rumble, Frenzy, Ravage, Ratbat...
Eject. Operation: Interference!

15:26.092 --> 15:28.015
Blaster: Optimus Prime,
do you read me?

15:28.016 --> 15:30.929
The Decepticons are blitzing
Autobot City.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.773
We're really taking...

15:34.016 --> 15:36.143
First we crack the shell,

15:36.144 --> 15:38.238
Then we crack the nuts inside!

15:46.446 --> 15:50.073
Hey! Run, Blaster!
Save yourself!

15:50.074 --> 15:51.997
No way! Two can play!

15:54.620 --> 15:56.079
Sic 'em!

16:09.385 --> 16:11.262
Do you think
you got through to Prime?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.690
Let's hope so. 'Cause if I didn't,

16:13.890 --> 16:16.313
we're all gonna look like
burned-out toaster ovens.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.191
We've got Decepticons at the
gates! Decepticons in the air!

16:21.192 --> 16:23.125
Blurr: Decepticons inside the
walls! Decepticons! Decepticons!

16:23.149 --> 16:24.418
If we beat them at the walls
they're still in the air,

16:24.442 --> 16:25.669
if we shoot them out of the air,
then they're still at the gates.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.693
So where does that leave us?
Nowhere, that's where!

16:41.334 --> 16:45.086
Come on, Arcee, <i>we</i> gotta get
this launcher into place.

16:45.087 --> 16:49.342
Megatron's making his big push
and we gotta push back!

16:51.552 --> 16:54.806
Keep at it, Springer, my boy,
help's at hand!

16:56.057 --> 16:57.599
Together, now.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.448
I was afraid you'd be trapped
outside the city.

17:07.449 --> 17:10.788
Unh! Hey, I wasn't worried
for a microsecond.

17:10.988 --> 17:14.834
Then you probably didn't
understand the situation.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.839
That did it.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.671
Constructicons,
merge for the kill!

17:27.672 --> 17:29.464
Kup, Hot Rod, look!

17:32.134 --> 17:33.260
Devastator.

17:36.973 --> 17:40.022
Devastator: Prepare
for extermination!

17:48.901 --> 17:51.825
I got better things
to do tonight than die.

18:30.026 --> 18:34.156
Megatron: Their defenses are
broken, let the slaughter begin!

18:40.411 --> 18:43.005
Dinobots, destroy Devastator!

18:43.205 --> 18:46.209
Me, Grimlock, love challenge!

18:53.132 --> 18:55.925
Dinobots transform!

19:20.201 --> 19:22.702
Megatron must be stopped...

19:22.703 --> 19:24.746
no matter the cost.

20:13.421 --> 20:14.671
Prime!

20:14.672 --> 20:18.925
One shall stand, one shall fall.

20:18.926 --> 20:22.303
Why throw away your life
so recklessly?

20:22.304 --> 20:25.774
That's a question you should
ask yourself, Megatron.

20:25.775 --> 20:29.612
No, I'll crush you
with my bare hands!

20:32.440 --> 20:34.441
Hot Rod: I've got to help Prime!

20:34.442 --> 20:37.286
Kup: Stay away, lad,
that's Prime's fight!

21:15.232 --> 21:18.327
I'll rip out your optics!

21:27.453 --> 21:30.081
Finish him off, Prime!
Do it now!

21:41.008 --> 21:43.301
No more, Optimus Prime!

21:43.302 --> 21:46.179
Grant me mercy, I beg of you!

21:46.180 --> 21:50.225
You, who are without mercy,
now plead for it?

21:50.226 --> 21:53.770
I thought you were
made of sterner stuff.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.980
No, you don't, Megatron!

21:55.981 --> 21:57.699
Out of the way, Hot Rod!

22:02.988 --> 22:05.116
Fall! Fall!

22:16.001 --> 22:19.462
I would've waited
an eternity for this.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.340
It's over, Prime.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.512
Never!

22:39.400 --> 22:42.199
Optimus... forgive me.

22:45.447 --> 22:49.293
How do you feel,
mighty Megatron?

22:50.327 --> 22:51.744
Yah!

22:51.745 --> 22:55.966
Astrotrain, transform
and get us out of here.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.295
Don't leave me, Soundwave.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.298
As you command, Megatron.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.150
The Decepticons are retreating.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.995
Prime did it,
he turned the tide.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.963
Astrotrain, take off!

24:02.691 --> 24:05.865
I fear the wounds are fatal.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.878
Prime, you can't die!

24:16.997 --> 24:18.920
Do not grieve.

24:20.125 --> 24:25.382
Soon I shall be
one with the Matrix.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.757
Prime...

24:30.552 --> 24:35.649
Ultra Magnus,
it... it is to you, old friend...

24:37.142 --> 24:40.645
I shall pass
the Matrix of Leadership

24:40.646 --> 24:42.563
as it was passed to me.

24:42.564 --> 24:46.609
But, Prime,
lam... just a soldier, I...

24:46.610 --> 24:48.611
I'm not worthy.

24:48.612 --> 24:51.739
Nor was I,

24:51.740 --> 24:56.911
but one day an Autobot
shall rise from our ranks

24:56.912 --> 25:01.499
and use the power of the Matrix

25:01.500 --> 25:05.505
to light... our darkest hour.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.729
Until that day...

25:22.730 --> 25:25.449
till all are one...

26:50.359 --> 26:54.403
Jettison some weight or I'll
never make it to Cybertron!

26:54.404 --> 26:56.823
Fellow Decepticons!

26:56.824 --> 27:01.869
Astrotrain has requested
that we lighten our burden.

27:01.870 --> 27:05.998
In that case, I say it is
survival of the fittest.

27:05.999 --> 27:08.292
Do I hear a second on that?

27:08.293 --> 27:10.002
Aye!

27:10.003 --> 27:11.754
And against?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.548
Nay!

27:13.549 --> 27:14.892
The ayes have it!

27:17.344 --> 27:20.268
- Get! Make room for others!
- Don't!

27:25.727 --> 27:29.689
Oh, how it pains me to do this.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.987
Wait...

27:31.191 --> 27:33.285
I still function.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.078
Wanna bet?

27:35.696 --> 27:38.575
Starscream!

27:41.952 --> 27:47.999
Well, as Megatron has,
how shall we say, departed,

27:48.000 --> 27:52.587
I nominate myself
as the new leader.

27:52.588 --> 27:55.715
Wait, the Constructicons
form Devastator,

27:55.716 --> 27:58.885
the most powerful robot.
We should rule!

27:58.886 --> 28:03.347
Soundwave superior.
Constructicons inferior.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.892
Who are you calling inferior?!

28:05.893 --> 28:09.729
Nobody would follow an
uncharismatic bore like you!

28:09.730 --> 28:12.899
Hey, nobody calls
Soundwave uncrassimatic!

28:12.900 --> 28:14.734
Yeah, let's kick tailgate!

28:14.735 --> 28:17.486
Constructicons unite!

28:19.489 --> 28:20.741
No way!

28:53.732 --> 28:56.611
Unicron: Welcome, Megatron.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.458
Who... who said that?

29:11.708 --> 29:14.882
I... am Unicron.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.427
Show yourself.

29:21.677 --> 29:24.351
I have summoned you here
for a purpose.

29:24.554 --> 29:28.975
Nobody summons Megatron.

29:28.976 --> 29:32.728
Then it pleases me
to be the first.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.323
State your business.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.067
This is my command.

29:38.068 --> 29:43.406
You are to destroy the
Autobot Matrix of Leadership.

29:43.407 --> 29:47.576
It is the one thing,
the only thing,

29:47.577 --> 29:50.204
that can stand in my way.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.873
You have nothing to fear.

29:52.874 --> 29:57.795
I have already crushed Optimus
Prime with my bare hands.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.588
You exaggerate.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.674
The point is, he's dead.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.926
And the Matrix died with him.

30:03.927 --> 30:08.389
No, the point is you are a fool.

30:08.390 --> 30:12.351
The Matrix has been passed
to their new leader,

30:12.352 --> 30:14.603
Ultra Magnus.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.982
- Destroy it for me.
- Why should I?

30:17.983 --> 30:19.525
What's in it for me?

30:19.526 --> 30:23.779
Your bargaining posture
is highly dubious.

30:23.780 --> 30:27.992
Very well, I will
provide you with a new body.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.077
And new troops to command.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.080
- And?
- And nothing!

30:33.957 --> 30:36.130
You belong to me now.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.884
I belong to nobody!

30:39.046 --> 30:41.890
Perhaps I misjudged you.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.967
Proceed...

30:44.968 --> 30:47.053
on your way to oblivion.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.972
Ah! No! No!

30:49.973 --> 30:53.893
I accept your terms! I accept!

30:53.894 --> 30:57.319
Ah!

30:58.982 --> 31:00.905
Excellent.

31:19.961 --> 31:23.381
Behold... Galvatron!

31:23.382 --> 31:26.932
And these shall be your minions.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.065
Scourge, the tracker.

31:34.059 --> 31:37.780
And his huntsmen... the Sweeps.

31:40.607 --> 31:41.950
Cyclonus.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.280
The warrior and his armada.

31:47.322 --> 31:50.622
And this shall be your ship.

31:51.493 --> 31:55.162
Now go.

31:55.163 --> 31:59.083
Destroy the Autobot Matrix.

31:59.084 --> 32:03.462
I will rip open Ultra Magnus
and every other Autobot.

32:03.463 --> 32:06.592
Until the Matrix
has been destroyed.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.932
To Cybertron!

32:23.984 --> 32:26.453
Destroy the Matrix.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.333
Get on with the ceremony!

32:52.721 --> 32:54.972
My fellow Decepticons.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.771
As your new leader, I...

33:01.688 --> 33:04.032
Who disrupts my coronation?!

33:06.067 --> 33:10.696
"Coronation," Starscream?
This is bad comedy.

33:10.697 --> 33:13.199
Megatron? ls that you?

33:13.200 --> 33:14.825
Here's a hint!

33:40.936 --> 33:45.147
Will anyone else
attempt to fill his shoes?

33:45.148 --> 33:47.742
What did he say his name was?

33:47.943 --> 33:49.570
Galvatron!

33:49.778 --> 33:52.827
All: Long live Galvatron!

33:52.989 --> 33:55.287
Galvatron!

34:04.918 --> 34:06.591
Where'd that come from?

34:09.339 --> 34:12.434
Who cares? I'm more worried
about where it's going!

34:17.514 --> 34:20.266
Talk to me, Earth,
we got a situation out here!

34:26.982 --> 34:30.650
Roger me, wilco me, anything!
Hello, hello, Earth!

34:30.652 --> 34:32.695
I'm picking up a faint signal.

34:34.281 --> 34:37.203
This is Jazz. A ginormous,
weird-looking planet

34:37.204 --> 34:39.996
just showed up
in the suburbs of Cybertron.

34:39.998 --> 34:42.714
Cliff jumper: And it's
attacking Moonbase One!

34:42.715 --> 34:44.083
Jazz! Cliff jumper!

34:54.217 --> 34:56.969
Got to blast free, if we can!

34:56.969 --> 34:59.689
- Ignition and...
- Hit it!

35:05.061 --> 35:07.063
Jazz, we're not getting away!

35:11.276 --> 35:15.321
This is Spike and Bumblebee
up here on Moonbase Two.

35:15.322 --> 35:18.198
This thing... this monster planet

35:18.199 --> 35:20.451
just ripped
the first moon to shreds.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.079
And it's heading this way!

35:22.080 --> 35:24.163
We'll try and slow it down.

35:24.164 --> 35:27.634
But you'd better get here fast
because we're not gonna...

35:27.635 --> 35:28.923
Dad!

35:30.712 --> 35:33.306
Spike: Bumblebee,
activate the explosives!

35:33.307 --> 35:36.300
If this doesn't stop it,
nothing will.

35:36.301 --> 35:39.100
The explosives are activated,
let's get out of here!

35:44.726 --> 35:48.105
Bumblebee: Hurry!
It's gonna blow!

36:08.124 --> 36:10.092
- Hooray! We've done it!
- We did it!

36:10.093 --> 36:12.211
Way to go!

36:12.212 --> 36:15.089
- Look!
- It isn't even dented.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.513
Oh, shit,
what are we gonna do now?

36:20.387 --> 36:23.061
Bumblebee: We're being
sucked into it!

36:24.849 --> 36:31.438
How dare Unicron? Cybertron
and all its moons belong to me!

36:37.070 --> 36:40.364
Remember, we belong to him.

36:40.365 --> 36:43.409
I belong to nobody!

36:49.374 --> 36:52.334
I will obey... Unicron.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.430
Decepticons, to Earth!

37:03.388 --> 37:06.060
Autobots, prepare to
board the shuttles.

37:06.061 --> 37:07.808
This new menace
is more dangerous

37:07.809 --> 37:09.903
than all the Decepticons
put together.

37:09.904 --> 37:13.731
Somehow we must destroy it
before it devours Cybertron.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.399
But what about my dad?

37:15.400 --> 37:19.445
He's on the moon between that
monster planet and Cybertron.

37:19.446 --> 37:22.823
Daniel, we'll do everything
we can for Spike.

37:22.824 --> 37:24.788
And what are we gonna do
when we get there?

37:24.789 --> 37:28.004
If that thing crunches moons,
it'll make short work of us.

37:28.005 --> 37:30.038
Maybe the Matrix can stop it.

37:30.039 --> 37:31.378
You're right, it can!

37:31.379 --> 37:33.297
What do you know about it, lad?

37:33.298 --> 37:35.586
I just got this feeling.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.055
Look!

37:40.383 --> 37:41.430
To the shuttles!

37:43.261 --> 37:48.688
I, Galvatron, will crush you
just as Megatron crushed Prime!

37:50.518 --> 37:52.566
And you'll die trying,
just like Megatron.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.273
Uh! Autobot scrap!

37:56.274 --> 37:59.443
Do you want me
to gut Ultra Magnus?

37:59.444 --> 38:03.540
There are plenty of Autobots
for you. Ultra Magnus is mine!

38:08.620 --> 38:10.537
Stay close to me, Daniel!

38:10.538 --> 38:12.256
And you better stay close to me!

38:16.419 --> 38:19.254
No, you'd better
stay close to me.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.340
Nice dino, good dino,
sweet dino,

38:21.341 --> 38:22.968
Won't you step into
the nice spaceship for Blurr?

38:22.969 --> 38:26.312
Pretty, pretty please? Nice
dino, good dino, sweet dino!

38:26.313 --> 38:29.807
Me, Grimlock, not nice dino!

38:29.808 --> 38:32.357
Me bash brains!

38:47.909 --> 38:50.327
Blurr, get the Dinobots
in the shuttle!

38:50.328 --> 38:51.453
I'm trying to get them
into the shuttle.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.001
Cos I know we can't
launch the shuttle.

38:53.002 --> 38:54.581
Until I get them
into the shuttle.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.129
But they're impossible,
impossible, impossible!

38:56.130 --> 38:57.709
Ok, forget it.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.962
Kup, Hot Rod, you guys
get the Dinobots aboard.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.636
And get out of here.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.689
Come on, you big bozo,
get in the shuttle!

39:20.400 --> 39:23.072
This reminds me
of the battle on Alpha 9.

39:23.073 --> 39:24.695
The petro-rabbits were...

39:24.696 --> 39:26.790
Grimlock, get your noodle
out of my face!

39:26.791 --> 39:30.993
Me, Grimlock,
love Kup's war stories!

39:30.994 --> 39:32.703
You're living one now.

39:32.704 --> 39:36.081
Engage the boosters,
for Cybertron's sake!

39:36.082 --> 39:40.168
Tell Grimlock about
petro-rabbits again.

39:40.169 --> 39:42.212
I'll give you petro-rabbits!

39:42.213 --> 39:43.465
Contact!

39:54.809 --> 39:56.937
Looks like we're
shipmates, squirt!

39:56.938 --> 39:58.478
All right!

39:58.479 --> 40:01.608
But if you get spacesick,
you're gonna walk home!

40:08.531 --> 40:09.703
Hurry!

40:12.619 --> 40:15.122
Wait, Ultra Magnus!
Arcee's still out there!

40:19.626 --> 40:20.843
Jump!

40:33.973 --> 40:35.557
Thanks.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.855
That was close.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.567
Believe it or not,
this is the fun part.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.464
Magnus: Congratulations,
Autobots, we've lost them,

40:58.465 --> 41:00.415
So rest while you can.

41:00.416 --> 41:04.753
Yep, I remember
the dust was so thick off Beta 4.

41:04.754 --> 41:07.849
You had to use windshield wipers
on your optic sensors.

41:07.850 --> 41:10.968
Me, Grimlock,
know all about wipers!

41:10.969 --> 41:13.971
Want to hear good part of story!

41:13.972 --> 41:16.807
Good part, Kup,
tell Swoop good part.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.184
Ok, ok.

41:19.185 --> 41:21.728
Well, the dust was really thick,

41:21.729 --> 41:24.648
and then this gigantic icthyac

41:24.649 --> 41:27.901
came tromping and stomping
down the mountain,

41:27.902 --> 41:30.737
flames spewing out
of its nostrils,

41:30.738 --> 41:32.327
and I thought for sure...

41:32.328 --> 41:34.995
Hey, Kup, don't you think we
have better things to do now

41:34.996 --> 41:36.370
than tell old stories?

41:36.371 --> 41:37.577
Like what?

41:37.578 --> 41:38.917
Like maybe figure out

41:38.918 --> 41:40.834
how we're gonna
rescue our friends

41:40.835 --> 41:42.334
and then save Cybertron.

41:42.335 --> 41:44.418
No! Tell story!

41:44.419 --> 41:46.294
- Shh!
- Quiet!

41:46.295 --> 41:48.138
Grimlock: We want to hear story!

41:50.299 --> 41:52.768
- Grr!
- Time-out! Time-out! Time-out!

42:04.647 --> 42:05.819
They're closing on us.

42:05.820 --> 42:08.608
Yep, like the shrikebats
of Dromedon.

42:08.609 --> 42:11.111
- How'd you beat them?
- I'm trying to remember.

42:11.112 --> 42:13.702
There were an awful lot
of casualties that day.

42:13.703 --> 42:15.746
Oh, yeah...
We inverted polarities!

42:18.578 --> 42:19.830
They're coming back!

42:26.711 --> 42:28.712
All right, we survived that!

42:28.713 --> 42:30.590
Yeah, but will we survive this?

42:35.553 --> 42:38.306
Galvatron: Cyclonus,
transform and attack.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.582
I can't control it!

43:03.748 --> 43:05.295
We're gonna crash!

43:10.213 --> 43:12.464
Kup and Hot Rod just bought it.

43:12.465 --> 43:14.467
I can't deal with that now.

43:18.679 --> 43:20.013
Face it, Magnus,

43:20.014 --> 43:23.393
The Decepticons are gonna dog us
until they see us dead!

43:23.394 --> 43:26.108
Then that's exactly
what they're gonna see.

43:26.109 --> 43:28.232
Prepare for
emergency separation.

43:28.233 --> 43:30.529
- That's too dangerous!
- What choice do we have?

44:00.471 --> 44:03.431
The Autobots
have been terminated.

44:03.432 --> 44:06.777
Excellent.
And the Matrix with them.

44:10.314 --> 44:11.773
Unicron!

44:11.774 --> 44:16.695
Why?! Take me to Unicron.
Take me now!

44:16.696 --> 44:17.788
Ah!

44:31.085 --> 44:34.715
Did we have to let them detonate
three-quarters of the ship?

44:34.716 --> 44:37.304
Seeing as how they would have
detonated four-quarters,

44:37.305 --> 44:39.052
I think it was a good choice.

44:39.053 --> 44:41.678
But now how are we gonna get there
in this wreck?

44:41.679 --> 44:44.726
Perceptor, can you locate
a place to set down for repairs?

44:44.727 --> 44:46.977
Gamma waves
in this sector of space

44:46.978 --> 44:50.446
create marginal navigation
probabilities. However...

44:50.447 --> 44:53.857
Ahem... yes, I believe I can.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.779
The planet of Junk
is in this vicinity.

44:55.780 --> 44:57.574
Magnus: Then let's go for it.

45:09.832 --> 45:12.834
Hot Rod: Kup! Grimlock!

45:12.835 --> 45:16.135
Slag! Anybody!

45:35.233 --> 45:38.401
Kup: Hot Rod! Help me!

45:38.402 --> 45:39.528
Kup?!

45:50.373 --> 45:51.456
Kup!

45:51.457 --> 45:52.709
Help!

46:36.836 --> 46:38.554
Kup?

46:39.922 --> 46:41.214
Talk to me!

46:43.884 --> 46:47.855
- Fix me...
- Sure, Kup. Right away.

47:13.205 --> 47:14.502
Brace for impact!

47:37.271 --> 47:40.150
Say something... anybody!

47:43.402 --> 47:46.076
Remind me to give
the autopilot a raise.

47:46.077 --> 47:47.824
Daniel?

47:48.991 --> 47:51.164
I... I'm ok.

47:53.746 --> 47:55.874
Let's try to salvage this thing.

47:55.875 --> 47:57.624
Can I help too?

47:57.625 --> 47:59.959
It's rough out there, kid.

47:59.960 --> 48:03.055
I think Daniel can make himself
useful with this.

48:03.056 --> 48:04.964
It was Spike's exo-suit.

48:04.965 --> 48:07.801
Dad's exo-suit!
He told me all about it.

48:07.802 --> 48:09.019
Here, try it on.

48:14.642 --> 48:17.316
Now, try to walk.
Come on, you can do it.

48:26.904 --> 48:29.532
Just think about what you
want to do before you do it.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.991
It... it's kind of tricky.

48:31.992 --> 48:32.992
Whoa! Oh!

48:36.330 --> 48:38.920
Keep on practicing,
you'll get the hang of it.

48:38.921 --> 48:41.635
Come on, showtime's over.
We've got work to do.

48:53.055 --> 48:56.275
This must be the junk capital
of the universe.

49:02.148 --> 49:05.364
Robot: Stop, thief!
No welcome-wagon "hello, stranger"

49:05.365 --> 49:07.782
with that good coffee
flavor for you.

49:10.364 --> 49:14.995
Offer expires while you wait.
Operators are standing by.

49:22.918 --> 49:25.717
That does it.
Well, what do you think?

49:34.388 --> 49:38.099
Of all the circuit-glitched,
diode-blowing dim-wittery.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.767
You left a piece out!

49:39.768 --> 49:42.020
No way!
You're just a little stiff.

49:42.021 --> 49:45.992
Anyway, all things considered,
you did an amazing job, lad.

49:45.993 --> 49:47.609
Amazing!

49:47.610 --> 49:49.152
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:49.153 --> 49:52.075
You even got rid of
that nasty burr in my rotator.

49:52.076 --> 49:56.043
Now, let's find the Dinobots
and get off this twisted planet.

50:14.178 --> 50:17.148
Don't act hostile.
I'll use the universal greeting.

50:17.149 --> 50:19.682
“Universal greeting"?

50:19.683 --> 50:22.527
Watch, I'll have 'em
eating out of my hand.

50:22.528 --> 50:26.314
<i>Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong!</i>

50:26.315 --> 50:29.150
<i>"Baa weep grahna
weep ninny bong"?</i>

50:29.151 --> 50:33.571
<i>All: Baa weep grahna
weep ninny bong.</i>

50:33.572 --> 50:36.950
See? The universal greeting
works every time.

50:36.951 --> 50:39.744
Now, without making
any sudden moves,

50:39.745 --> 50:41.788
offer them an Energon goodie.

50:44.708 --> 50:47.001
This is getting expensive!

50:47.002 --> 50:49.300
Kup: Don't worry,
they'll reciprocate.

50:52.174 --> 50:55.260
I thought they were
supposed to reciprocate?

50:55.261 --> 50:56.137
No more!

50:59.014 --> 51:00.431
Empty!

51:19.076 --> 51:22.787
Reminds me of the Nitith
slave mine on Galganas 7.

51:22.788 --> 51:25.503
Hot Rod: Every place
reminds you of someplace else.

51:25.504 --> 51:28.214
Kup: Experience, lad, you should
learn to appreciate it.

51:28.215 --> 51:30.086
Hot Rod: Lot of good
it's done us so far.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.672
Hey, what's going on over there?

51:32.673 --> 51:37.176
Has the imperial magistrate
reached a verdict?

51:37.177 --> 51:39.220
I have.

51:39.221 --> 51:42.020
Alien official: Guilty
or innocent?

51:43.100 --> 51:44.267
Innocent.

51:44.268 --> 51:47.147
Feed him to the Sharkticons.

51:57.072 --> 51:59.370
We've got to get
a new travel agent.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.502
What is this place?

52:11.253 --> 52:14.172
Robot: The world of
the savage Sharkticons

52:14.173 --> 52:17.342
and their cruel masters,
the Quintessons.

52:17.343 --> 52:19.344
I am Kranix.

52:19.345 --> 52:22.347
My planet was
destroyed by Unicron.

52:22.348 --> 52:24.974
Unicron? Who's Unicron?

52:24.975 --> 52:29.646
A planet that devours
everything in its path.

52:29.647 --> 52:32.482
So that's the monster's name.

52:35.527 --> 52:37.153
Kranix: No, please!

52:37.154 --> 52:40.784
Ah! I'm the last survivor
of Lithone!

52:41.700 --> 52:43.368
No!

52:43.369 --> 52:45.161
Let him go!

52:45.162 --> 52:46.630
Ah!

52:47.873 --> 52:50.592
Soon, you too
shall receive your sentence.

52:52.378 --> 52:56.506
Has the imperial magistrate
reached a verdict?

52:56.507 --> 52:58.341
I have.

52:58.342 --> 53:01.552
Guilty or innocent?

53:01.553 --> 53:05.098
Spare me
this mockery of justice!

53:05.099 --> 53:10.151
I repeat, guilty or innocent?

53:11.230 --> 53:12.607
Innocent.

53:14.149 --> 53:15.275
Ah!

53:17.361 --> 53:18.783
Ah!

53:25.703 --> 53:28.172
Not the end I'd wish for, lad.

53:39.007 --> 53:41.175
Me, Swoop, no see nothing.

53:41.176 --> 53:46.013
Me, Grimlock, positive
Hot Rod and Kup close.

53:46.014 --> 53:50.064
Me, Slag, say you
full of beryllium baloney.

53:52.479 --> 53:56.774
Me, Grimlock, say you
full of cesium salami!

53:56.775 --> 53:58.985
Beryllium baloney!

54:00.696 --> 54:02.447
♪ High voice: ♪
♪ Friend find, look behind ♪

54:02.448 --> 54:04.416
Grimlock: Who say that?

54:11.415 --> 54:13.332
♪ Friend find, look behind ♪

54:13.333 --> 54:15.960
You go wrong way.
You fool, I say.

54:15.961 --> 54:18.379
Me, Grimlock, fool?

54:18.380 --> 54:21.424
Picture you got,
no fool you not!

54:22.593 --> 54:26.518
Me, Grimlock, no like you.

54:31.935 --> 54:33.608
Ow!

54:34.772 --> 54:37.732
Why boy hit my nose?

54:37.733 --> 54:40.407
Wheelie save fine friends today.

54:41.487 --> 54:44.115
Me, Grimlock, say we on our way.

54:59.463 --> 55:03.093
Unicron,
why did you torture me?!

55:03.717 --> 55:07.597
- You have failed.
- No, Unicron!

55:07.805 --> 55:12.809
Ultra Magnus is dead
and the Matrix destroyed.

55:12.810 --> 55:17.236
The Matrix...
has not been destroyed.

55:18.065 --> 55:22.366
And Ultra Magnus lives
on the planet of Junk.

55:23.445 --> 55:26.619
Stalk him. Tear him apart.

55:27.866 --> 55:30.961
And destroy the Matrix.

55:35.958 --> 55:38.507
Be sure the fittings
are securely welded.

55:38.710 --> 55:39.854
Absolutely, positively
definitely,

55:39.878 --> 55:41.958
I wouldn't do it any other way!
Any other way at all!

55:42.130 --> 55:44.553
Wow! This exo-suit's fantastic!

55:44.758 --> 55:46.510
I think I'm starting to
get the hang of it.

55:57.813 --> 55:59.397
Decepticons!

55:59.398 --> 56:01.947
We've got to draw them off
and double back to the shuttle.

56:15.914 --> 56:17.336
There goes the shuttle!

56:24.548 --> 56:26.173
What do I do?!

56:26.174 --> 56:28.893
Transform! Transform! You can
do it, I know you can do it!

56:31.138 --> 56:32.435
Transform!

56:38.478 --> 56:40.563
Human germ!

56:40.564 --> 56:42.487
Transform!

56:43.609 --> 56:45.577
Yeah!

56:50.407 --> 56:53.081
There they are. Attack!

57:01.084 --> 57:02.504
Make a break for cover.

57:02.505 --> 57:04.675
I'll try to unleash
the power of the Matrix.

57:06.214 --> 57:07.966
Autobots: Till all are one!

57:10.928 --> 57:12.396
Till all are one!

57:22.522 --> 57:24.900
Open, damn it, open!

57:27.527 --> 57:31.657
Prime, you said the Matrix
would light our darkest hour.

57:31.865 --> 57:36.086
Magnus! I want the Matrix!

57:36.286 --> 57:37.412
Never!

57:37.621 --> 57:39.544
Sweeps, terminate him!

57:44.544 --> 57:45.962
Ah!

57:45.963 --> 57:47.546
Galvatron: Die!

57:47.547 --> 57:49.140
Die!

57:52.469 --> 57:56.013
Unicron, my master,

57:56.014 --> 58:00.770
with this I shall
make you my slave.

58:04.606 --> 58:07.735
Before his imperial magistrate
delivers a verdict,

58:07.736 --> 58:10.611
would you like to
beg for your lives?

58:10.612 --> 58:14.833
It sometimes helps,
but not often.

58:15.534 --> 58:17.952
I can't transform.

58:17.953 --> 58:19.412
Keep trying-

58:19.413 --> 58:22.542
Silence or you will be held
in contempt of this court!

58:22.543 --> 58:25.260
I have nothing but contempt
for this court.

58:25.460 --> 58:28.930
Guilty or innocent?

58:29.089 --> 58:30.591
Innocent.

58:36.430 --> 58:39.978
They've got more Sharkticons
than we have photon charges.

58:39.979 --> 58:42.023
Then let's hold
a demolition derby.

59:32.694 --> 59:36.244
Didn't even bend a fender!

59:37.324 --> 59:39.038
Yeah, but look,
there are a lot more

59:39.039 --> 59:41.628
of those can-diggin',
grill-crackin' things!

59:47.167 --> 59:49.044
We can't hold out forever, Kup,

59:49.252 --> 59:52.131
but we can give them
one humungous repair bill!

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.700
Execute them!

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:20.538
Excuse me!

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.499
Me, Grimlock, want to munch metal.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:56.070
I never thought I'd be
so happy to see those big bozos!

01:00:56.071 --> 01:00:58.279
Me, Grimlock, no bozo!

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.623
Me king!

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:02.166
Sharkticons, execute them!

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:11.923
Me, Grimlock, say execute them!

01:01:17.132 --> 01:01:19.925
Kup: I think the problems
on this planet

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.844
will be solved very shortly.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:25.019
Hot Rod: Yeah, but what about
our problems? We need a ship.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.891
You get ship if I get trip!

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:28.267
Who are you?

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:29.894
Him Wheelie.

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:31.854
Him friend!

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:34.483
He'll be mine too
if he can find a ship.

01:01:34.484 --> 01:01:36.817
Give stare over there.

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:39.287
That's a ship?

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:41.956
Who cares, as long as it flies.

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:54.752
Arcee: Ultra Magnus!

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:57.632
Without the Matrix there is no
hope, no, hope, no hope at all.

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:01.218
First Prime, now Ultra Magnus.
What'll we do?

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.975
- Look!
- Robot: Don't look behind

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.978
door number 2, Monty!

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:10.152
It's time to play
"End of the line, my valentine.”"

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:14.528
Geroni-do-ron-ron-ronimo!

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:49.807
Springer: It's not hard
to knock 'em down,

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:52.982
it's getting 'em to stay down
that's the trick.

01:02:52.983 --> 01:02:56.733
They're indestructible!
And they're everywhere!

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.705
You check in
but you don't check out.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.214
Steady as she goes, Bob.

01:04:04.215 --> 01:04:07.515
Snooping visitors getting mud in
the eye, by and by. Film at 11.

01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:16.060
It's Hot Rod!

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:18.063
And Kup and the Dinobots!

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.025
Guns aren't exactly friendly.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.698
Neither are they,
in case you haven't noticed.

01:04:25.699 --> 01:04:29.290
What was that universal greeting
again? Never mind, I remember.

01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:33.410
<i>Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong!</i>

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:36.789
<i>Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong?</i>

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:39.792
<i>Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong.</i>

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:43.170
<i>Baa weep grahna weep ninny bong!</i>

01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:46.220
All: <i>Baa</i> weep <i>grahna
weep ninny bong!</i>

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:11.448
Ugh! Me, Grimlock, not kisser!

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:13.167
Me, Grimlock, king!

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:19.581
Have a nice day! Please close
cover before striking, friends!

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:23.293
..So say the Junkions!

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:25.922
Where'd you learn
to talk like that?

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:29.977
T.V. We talk T.V.
You talk some T.V.?

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:33.771
I talk some T.V... And now
the news, don't touch that dial.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.641
By george, kemo sabes,

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:41.522
Your smashed-up friend soon like
brand-new with 90-day warranty.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:55.043
Happy motoring!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.414
Daniel: Look, he's alive!

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:02.416
He's alive, I don't believe it!

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:05.377
You're... all alive.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.051
The Matrix...

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.758
It's gone.

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.718
And with it, all hope.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:15.095
- No!
- Galvatron has it!

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:17.019
Where's Galvatron? Where is he?

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.985
And the answer is...

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:21.607
Unicron!

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:24.030
Then we've got to
destroy Unicron.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.528
Yes, friends,
and now destroy Unicron.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:28.155
Kill the Grand Poobah!

01:06:28.156 --> 01:06:31.069
Eliminate even
the toughest stain.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:34.239
Help us, home us.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.833
Sale must end.
Rush right on down.

01:06:35.834 --> 01:06:39.369
And test-drive latest model
with no obligation.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:43.207
New, improved Junkion planet
is sleek, sexy import.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.302
With turbo handling!

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:58.055
Junkions: Yeah, destroy Unicron!
Kill the Grand Poobah!

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:00.682
Eliminate even
the toughest stains!

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.226
Destroy Unicron...!

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:17.333
Galvatron: Unicron!

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:20.545
Unicron, answer me!

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:23.288
See this? The Matrix!

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:27.376
I now possess
that which you most fear.

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:34.176
You will do my bidding
or taste my wrath.

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:43.151
You underestimate me, Galvatron.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:34.069
For a time...

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:36.486
I considered sparing

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:39.363
your wretched
little planet, Cybertron.

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:41.408
But now...

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:45.287
You shall witness...
its dismemberment!

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.711
Galvatron: No!

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.341
Decepticons, we're under attack!

01:08:58.343 --> 01:08:59.469
Scramble!

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:41.218
Kup: I don't believe it.

01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:43.346
Doesn't this remind you
of anything, Kup?

01:09:43.348 --> 01:09:44.970
Nope.

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:47.066
I've never seen
anything like this before.

01:09:47.067 --> 01:09:51.520
What happened to Moonbase Two?
Where's my dad?!

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.649
That's what
we're gonna find out.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.823
Junkion: Framed in enamel!

01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:05.373
Resists fire, rain and corrosion
for up to 5 years.

01:10:05.374 --> 01:10:07.369
Satisfaction guaranteed.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:10.169
All: Or your money back!

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:39.443
- Where's Hot Rod?
- I don't know.

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:41.321
But I hope they didn't get him!

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:44.912
Arcee: Quick, this way!

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:25.405
The Matrix!

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:28.580
It will do you no good, Autobot.
It cannot be opened.

01:11:28.581 --> 01:11:31.453
Not by a Decepticon.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:35.584
Like it or not, we are allies
now against a common foe.

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:38.752
Ah!

01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:41.963
Unicron: Destroy him, Galvatron.
Now!

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.633
Or you yourself
shall be obliterated.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.853
Of course, my master!

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.287
Puny Autobot,
you lack even Prime's courage!

01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:24.966
Me, Grimlock, kick butt!

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:46.454
Me, Grimlock, need new strategy.

01:12:56.831 --> 01:12:58.456
Help!

01:12:58.457 --> 01:12:59.541
Help!

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:00.839
Daniel!

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.824
Arcee! Kup!

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:00.352
Dad!

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:01.561
Daniel!

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:03.521
Dad, what can I do?!

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.607
Knock down the acid cover!

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:06.650
How?!

01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:07.984
Blast it, son!

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:09.486
But I don't have a gun!

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:11.364
Use your exo-suit!

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:15.830
Hurry!

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:23.713
Dad!

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:33.009
Daniel! You did it!

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.479
Yeah! I did it!

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:41.184
Come out, Autobot!

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:44.562
We all must die sometime.

01:14:44.563 --> 01:14:46.440
Not today, Galvatron!

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:28.654
I will crush you
with my bare hands.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:34.413
Die, Autobot!

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:53.214
First Prime,

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.008
then Ultra Magnus,

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:57.802
and now... you.

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:01.723
It's a pity
you Autobots die so easily

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:06.025
or I might have
a sense of satisfaction now.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.784
Optimus: Arise, Rodimus Prime.

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.620
Hot Rod: Optimus...

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:21.498
No!

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:34.511
This is the end of the road,
Galvatron.

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:44.484
Ah!

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:58.619
Now, light our darkest hour.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:44.951
Spike! Daniel!

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:46.953
Springer, what's going on?!

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:50.379
No time to answer that now -
let's get out of here!

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:56.384
Look!

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:04.727
Autobots,
transform and roll out!

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:12.896
I knew you had potential, lad.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:40.798
Destiny!

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:42.926
You cannot...

01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:44.469
destroy...

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.471
my...

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:48.099
destiny!

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:03.531
Let this mark the end
of the Cybertronian Wars

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:07.992
as we march forward to a new age
of peace and happiness!

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.869
Till all are one!

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:11.713
All: Till all are one!

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:14.796
Till all are one!

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:18.136
