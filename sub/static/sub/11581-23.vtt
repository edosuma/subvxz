00:06.074 --> 00:08.242
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.276 --> 00:11.079
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.448
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.482 --> 00:16.350
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.384 --> 00:18.119
are members of an elite squad

00:18.152 --> 00:20.088
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.455
These are their stories.

00:23.291 --> 00:27.095
WOMAN:
The doctor said
if she survives,

00:27.128 --> 00:29.263
she'll be brain damaged.

00:29.297 --> 00:33.101
Were you with your niece
when she got sick?

00:33.134 --> 00:35.669
My brother called, frantic.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.239
Alexis wasn't breathing.

00:38.272 --> 00:41.075
Pete wanted me to meet him here
to help take care of the kids

00:41.109 --> 00:42.243
while they talked
to the doctors.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.277
How long has Alexis

00:43.311 --> 00:44.412
lived with them?

00:44.445 --> 00:45.546
He and Karen adopted her

00:45.579 --> 00:47.481
from Romania last year,

00:47.515 --> 00:49.283
when she was three.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.452
These two were a surprise.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.188
They were born
right after the adoption.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.395
The hospital called you because
they think Alexis was poisoned.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.564
What do you think?

01:03.597 --> 01:07.135
My sister-in-law did it.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.137
She's so cruel to her.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.339
Never a kind word.

01:11.372 --> 01:14.142
Never a kiss or hug.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.643
And how does she treat
the other children?

01:15.676 --> 01:17.311
Karen dotes on the
twins and Katie.

01:17.345 --> 01:21.149
Alexis, she sees as a burden.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.450
How old is Katie?

01:22.483 --> 01:23.584
Seven.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.219
Do you think
she might be able

01:25.253 --> 01:26.520
to tell us what happened?

01:26.554 --> 01:28.556
She loves Alexis.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.459
I hope so.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.726
STABLER:
Can you tell me
what happened

01:32.760 --> 01:34.228
when you came home
from school today?

01:34.262 --> 01:36.197
I watched SpongeBob.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.199
Where was Alexis?

01:38.232 --> 01:41.335
In the corner,
in the kitchen.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.337
What was she doing
in the corner?

01:43.371 --> 01:45.206
When she's bad,
Mommy puts her there

01:45.239 --> 01:47.675
and makes her practice
her numbers.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.343
She can only count to ten,

01:49.377 --> 01:51.412
so she has to do it
over and over

01:51.445 --> 01:53.181
and over.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.615
What kind of bad things
does she do?

01:54.648 --> 01:55.916
Today, she wrote
on the wall

01:55.949 --> 01:57.751
with a crayon.

01:57.785 --> 02:01.355
Did you see Alexis drink or eat
anything bad today?

02:01.389 --> 02:05.226
She drank the soapy water.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.727
What soapy water?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.762
Mommy gave
Alexis a pail

02:08.796 --> 02:09.863
to wash the wall.

02:09.897 --> 02:13.201
She was crying, so Mommy
put the sponge in her mouth.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.568
She kept spitting it out.

02:14.602 --> 02:18.272
Mommy got mad.

02:18.306 --> 02:21.275
And when Mommy got mad,
what did she do then?

02:21.309 --> 02:23.244
She made it all soapy again

02:23.277 --> 02:25.246
and put it back in her mouth.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.215
Alexis was coughing.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.584
Then what happened?

02:30.618 --> 02:34.222
She threw up.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.223
She kept trying to sit down

02:35.223 --> 02:37.691
but Mommy made her stand
in the corner again.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.760
When Daddy came home,

02:39.793 --> 02:42.496
Alexis fell and she
wouldn't get up.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.265
WOMAN:
Katie?

02:44.298 --> 02:45.533
Mama.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.669
The doctor said
that you needed to see us.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.605
Why don't we let Katie
say good night to Alexis.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.241
Come on, sweetheart.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.377
What's wrong?

02:56.410 --> 02:58.546
We'd like both of you to
come down to our precinct.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.648
Well, we have to get
the children home.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.283
Lady, if I have anything
to say about it,

03:02.316 --> 03:03.284
you'll never
see those kids again.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.285
You're under arrest.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.286
MAN:
What?!

03:05.319 --> 03:07.255
For attempted murder of
your adopted daughter.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.589
You have the right
to remain silent...

03:08.622 --> 03:10.258
Let's go.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.476
Look, you're making a mistake.
I love Alexis.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.612
BENSON:
Not according to
your sister-in-law.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.347
Wendy never liked me.
You can't listen to her.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.316
Can we listen to Katie,
Mrs. Campbell?

04:08.349 --> 04:09.617
GATES:
Oh, sure, Detective,

04:09.650 --> 04:11.619
because seven-year-olds
are so reliable.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.586
Tomorrow,
she'll tell you

04:12.620 --> 04:13.887
that a pony with wings
lives in her closet.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.489
So Katie made
the whole thing up, huh?

04:15.523 --> 04:16.557
Like how you shoved

04:16.590 --> 04:19.627
a sponge full of soapy water
into Alexis's mouth,

04:19.660 --> 04:21.529
repeatedly,
while she gagged and cried?

04:21.562 --> 04:23.497
I don't know where Katie
would get that...

04:23.531 --> 04:24.698
You made her stand
in the corner,

04:24.732 --> 04:27.468
counting,
until she collapsed.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.403
GATES:
Plenty of children
accidentally

04:29.437 --> 04:30.804
ingest household poisons.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.640
It's sad,
but it's a fact of life.

04:32.673 --> 04:33.741
It's not a crime.

04:33.774 --> 04:34.775
So, it was an accident.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.344
I feel terrible
that I wasn't

04:36.377 --> 04:38.446
paying close enough attention.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.382
But I can't possibly be
everywhere at once.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.784
I have four children.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.586
I'm a good mother.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.621
I would never hurt Alexis.

04:47.655 --> 04:48.789
MAN:
Why don't you believe me?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.524
We do believe you,
Mr. Campbell.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.092
That's why you're
not under arrest.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.727
My wife did nothing wrong.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.563
FIN:
But you couldn't know
what your wife did.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.464
You were gone all day.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.566
I told you,
when I got home from work,

04:58.599 --> 05:00.634
Alexis had stopped
breathing, and Karen

05:00.668 --> 05:01.869
was hysterical.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.871
If we wanted to poison Alexis,

05:03.904 --> 05:05.539
why would we rush her
to the hospital?

05:05.573 --> 05:06.640
MUNCH:
Actually, I'm interested

05:06.674 --> 05:07.608
in why your wife
does the things

05:07.641 --> 05:09.577
she does.
Like what?

05:09.610 --> 05:11.612
Berate and emotionally abuse
your adopted daughter.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.580
That's a lie!

05:12.613 --> 05:14.114
FIN:
Are you calling your
sister a liar?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.416
She says Karen
treats that girl

05:15.449 --> 05:16.850
worse than a dog.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.552
Wendy was always jealous
of my wife.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.488
How can I make you understand?

05:20.521 --> 05:22.756
Karen loved Alexis.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.459
You mean loves Alexis,
don't you, Mr. Campbell?

05:25.493 --> 05:27.528
Present tense.
The girl's not dead yet.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.600
HUANG:
The emergency room pumped
two cups of detergent

05:32.633 --> 05:33.601
out of Alexis's stomach.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.669
Mrs. Campbell's accident
story's a bunch of crap.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.672
There is no kid who's
going to drink two cups
of that stuff willingly.

05:38.706 --> 05:39.707
What about
the dear old dad?

05:39.740 --> 05:40.708
He had to know

05:40.741 --> 05:41.709
that his wife
hated that kid.

05:41.742 --> 05:42.543
Wasn't home,

05:42.576 --> 05:43.844
so he's not criminally
responsible.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.912
But we got the
mother, right?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.447
How's the seven-year-old?

05:46.480 --> 05:47.681
Solid.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.583
No chance you influenced
her statement?

05:49.617 --> 05:50.618
None.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.819
Counselor,
I've been doing this

05:51.852 --> 05:52.853
a little bit longer
than you.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.221
Just making sure
we're covered.

05:54.254 --> 05:57.157
Children under nine
aren't automatically
considered swearable.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.426
I can talk to her.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.628
If she knows the difference
between a lie and the truth,

06:00.661 --> 06:02.696
and the consequences
of telling a lie in court,

06:02.730 --> 06:04.765
then she can testify.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.836
HUANG:
Okay, tell me what color
that is.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.971
Purple.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.474
Well, what if I said
it was orange?

06:13.507 --> 06:15.876
Would that be the
truth or would
that be a lie?

06:15.909 --> 06:17.545
A lie.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.846
How come?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.948
'Cause it's purple.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.651
Right.

06:23.684 --> 06:27.688
Let me ask you
something about...
about promises.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.589
If you promised
your mother

06:28.622 --> 06:30.591
that you're going
to clean your room,

06:30.624 --> 06:31.625
and then you
don't do it,

06:31.659 --> 06:33.494
what happens?

06:33.527 --> 06:34.562
I get in trouble.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.030
Why is that?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.766
'Cause I promised.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.769
Right again.

06:41.802 --> 06:42.970
You're really good.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.774
You ever go to
church sometimes?

06:48.776 --> 06:50.811
Who lives in church?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.713
God.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.515
Are you allowed
to lie to God?

06:54.548 --> 06:55.783
No.

06:55.816 --> 06:56.950
If you make a promise to God

06:56.984 --> 06:58.719
that you're only going
to tell the truth,

06:58.752 --> 07:01.822
do you have to keep
that promise?

07:03.991 --> 07:06.960
What if you tell a lie?

07:06.994 --> 07:10.664
You'll really, really
get in trouble.

07:10.698 --> 07:13.066
JUDGE:
Your chief witness

07:13.100 --> 07:14.935
is the defendant's
seven-year-old daughter?

07:14.968 --> 07:16.670
That sounds a bit imprudent.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.071
Prior courts have held
otherwise, Your Honor.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.808
Rittenhouse v. North Hempstead
found a three-year-old

07:20.841 --> 07:22.776
wasn't automatically presumed
incompetent to testify.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.546
Ah, but you're
in my court now.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.080
GATES:
And LaPlant v. Atias

07:27.114 --> 07:28.716
disqualified a seven-
year-old witness.

07:28.749 --> 07:29.883
It's completely subjective.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.952
Which is why a
psychiatrist examined
Katie Campbell

07:31.985 --> 07:33.821
and determined that she
understands her duty

07:33.854 --> 07:34.522
to tell the truth.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.524
I'm sure the People won't mind

07:36.524 --> 07:37.825
if I determine that myself.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.527
It's not necessary,
Your Honor.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.060
But, again,

07:40.093 --> 07:42.062
it's in my court.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.964
Produce the girl
and I'll conduct

07:43.997 --> 07:45.833
a swearability examination

07:45.866 --> 07:46.900
in chambers.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.703
By the way, Ms. Novak,

07:49.737 --> 07:50.771
when you appear in my courtroom,

07:50.804 --> 07:53.907
I would appreciate
you are dressed appropriately.

07:53.941 --> 07:57.711
By that,
I mean in a skirt.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.980
9:00 a.m. tomorrow,
counselors.

08:04.585 --> 08:08.822
I don't want you to be
afraid, Miss Campbell,

08:08.856 --> 08:10.758
I just want you
to answer the questions

08:10.791 --> 08:12.760
as honestly as you can.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.027
Understand?

08:15.763 --> 08:17.831
You have to speak up
for the lady typing.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.868
JUDGE:
Now, Miss Campbell,

08:20.901 --> 08:23.971
do you understand the difference
between the truth and a lie?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.573
Yeah.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.608
If you told us
about something

08:27.641 --> 08:28.742
you did not see or hear,

08:28.776 --> 08:31.879
would that be the truth
or a lie?

08:31.912 --> 08:33.814
What?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.015
Do you understand
the question?

08:35.048 --> 08:36.717
Um...

08:36.750 --> 08:38.919
Speak aloud.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.854
Let the record show
that the witness

08:40.888 --> 08:43.757
is unable to answer
the question.

08:43.791 --> 08:47.895
If you came into court,
raised your right hand,

08:47.928 --> 08:49.897
and you swore
to tell the truth,

08:49.930 --> 08:50.798
and you told a lie,

08:50.831 --> 08:54.067
what do you think
would happen to you?

08:54.101 --> 08:56.670
( voice breaking ):
I don't know.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.907
Do you know what
the word "truth" means?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.043
Thank you.
You're excused.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.656
Well, I think that answers
the question of swearability.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.658
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

09:17.691 --> 09:18.926
I was confused
by those questions.

09:18.959 --> 09:19.927
I wouldn't go around

09:19.960 --> 09:21.695
admitting that, Ms. Novak.

09:21.729 --> 09:22.830
The defense moves

09:22.863 --> 09:23.831
for dismissal, Your Honor.

09:23.864 --> 09:24.765
Without the People's witness,
there's no case.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.167
Your Honor didn't say
she can't testify.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.636
She just can't be sworn.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.937
Her statement
can be corroborated

09:29.970 --> 09:31.839
by the detergent found
in the victim's stomach.

09:31.872 --> 09:32.706
Evidence which also

09:32.740 --> 09:34.141
corroborates an
accidental ingestion.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.743
It might.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.210
Why don't we let a jury decide?

09:37.244 --> 09:41.014
Mr. Gates, I'm inclined
to agree with Ms. Novak.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.816
Then I move to suppress the
girl's testimony, Your Honor.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.685
She spoke with an SVU detective

09:44.718 --> 09:46.219
alone, without parental
supervision.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.955
That's standard procedure.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.923
Child witnesses don't need
parental supervision.

09:49.957 --> 09:50.924
We can't be sure

09:50.958 --> 09:52.225
that anything this girl said

09:52.259 --> 09:53.894
wasn't influenced by the police.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.963
SVU detectives are trained
to interview children.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.965
And I'd love to hear
all about that.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.833
I'm ordering a Hudy hearing.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.970
Your detective proves he didn't
tell young Miss Campbell

10:03.003 --> 10:04.938
what to say, I'll allow
her testimony.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.812
NOVAK:
Detective Stabler, at any point

10:11.845 --> 10:13.146
during your questioning
of Katie Campbell,

10:13.180 --> 10:14.882
did you suggest her mother
was responsible

10:14.915 --> 10:16.784
for poisoning
the victim?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.018
Never.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.720
In fact, Katie
introduced her mother

10:19.753 --> 10:21.254
into the conversation
without any prompting.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.255
Did you vilify

10:22.289 --> 10:23.991
or criticize her mother
in a way

10:24.024 --> 10:25.726
that would influence
her statement?

10:25.759 --> 10:26.827
I expressed no opinion

10:26.860 --> 10:27.961
about the defendant.

10:27.995 --> 10:28.962
Thank you.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.899
Nothing further, Your Honor.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.036
Why haven't we heard
the audio tape

10:36.069 --> 10:38.138
of this interview,
Detective Stabler?

10:38.171 --> 10:40.974
Standard procedure does not
require police to record

10:41.008 --> 10:42.710
interviews with witnesses.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.744
How convenient.

10:43.777 --> 10:46.046
So you make a mistake,

10:46.079 --> 10:47.280
no one will hear it.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.882
I didn't make a mistake.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.851
In general,
when a child is injured,

10:50.884 --> 10:53.787
who is your first suspect?

10:55.188 --> 10:56.890
Depends on the circumstances.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.091
Oh, come on,
Detective,

10:58.125 --> 11:00.260
isn't it true
you look to the parents

11:00.293 --> 11:01.762
before anyone else?

11:01.795 --> 11:03.797
When the situation
warrants it, yes.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.199
Are you out to get
Karen Campbell?

11:06.233 --> 11:07.234
Of course not.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.969
Didn't you
tell my client,

11:09.002 --> 11:11.104
that if you had anything
to do with it,

11:11.138 --> 11:13.106
she'd never see her kids again?

11:17.077 --> 11:18.912
That's out of context.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.948
Yes or no, Detective?

11:20.981 --> 11:21.949
Yes.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.216
So it sounds like

11:23.250 --> 11:25.052
you had some
pretty strong feelings

11:25.085 --> 11:27.054
about my client's guilt
the moment you met her.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.989
My feelings have nothing
to do with any of this.

11:29.022 --> 11:29.923
Now you assumed

11:29.957 --> 11:32.826
my client was guilty
and that influenced

11:32.860 --> 11:34.061
how you questioned her
seven-year-old daughter.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.195
That's completely false.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.997
I know how to conduct
an interview.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.967
Thank you, Detective.
Nothing further.

11:41.802 --> 11:45.305
You're excused, Detective.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.776
Ms. Novak, I'm afraid the People

11:48.776 --> 11:49.910
haven't met
their burden

11:49.943 --> 11:52.079
in proving the interview
wasn't suggestive.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.047
Therefore, the defense
motion to suppress

11:54.081 --> 11:56.016
the witness' testimony
is granted.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.217
This is a joke.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.087
I beg your pardon,
Detective Stabler?

12:02.155 --> 12:03.891
I said this is a joke.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.292
You'd be wise
to remember

12:05.325 --> 12:07.060
no one cares what you think

12:07.094 --> 12:09.797
once you're out
of that box, Detective.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.998
The interview wasn't suggestive.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.032
Elliot, stop...

12:12.065 --> 12:13.100
One of these judges who thinks

12:13.133 --> 12:14.101
cops strong-arm witnesses

12:14.134 --> 12:15.903
in order to make their case?

12:15.936 --> 12:18.005
What, you think I just bullied
a seven-year-old into lying?

12:18.038 --> 12:19.840
Elliot, leave.

12:19.873 --> 12:20.841
No, Elliot, stay.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.210
Enjoy the hospitality
of our holding cells.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.277
You're in contempt.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.079
Officer of the Court,

12:26.113 --> 12:28.215
escort the detective
out of here.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.083
( gavel pounds )

12:40.393 --> 12:42.329
You all right?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.330
I'm great.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.965
Thanks for getting me
a couple of hours off.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.166
You are not blaming
this on me.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.835
Well, you did let
that defense attorney

12:47.835 --> 12:49.236
trash me pretty good
in that courtroom.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.838
Yeah, and that stunt
that you pulled.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.339
That's going to help
insure that Judge Taft

12:52.372 --> 12:54.074
is going to screw me
in the trial, but hey,

12:54.107 --> 12:55.242
at least your ego
is still intact.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.310
My ego? You got me out of
there to talk about my ego?

12:57.344 --> 12:58.879
I did not get
you out of there.

12:58.912 --> 12:59.712
I called in a favor.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.048
The contempt
citation is withdrawn.

13:01.081 --> 13:05.085
So if you could
possibly stop acting
like a petulant child,

13:05.118 --> 13:06.854
that'll be thanks enough.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.322
And you-- you need to start
playing nice

13:09.356 --> 13:10.858
with Oliver Taft.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.293
This guy is an
arrogant prick.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.863
True, and he completely takes
issue with young attorneys

13:15.896 --> 13:18.131
who think they know more
about the law than he does.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.199
You're worried
about my ego?

13:19.232 --> 13:21.368
This guy abuses his power
and gets away with it.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.871
You didn't help
the situation
by mouthing off

13:23.871 --> 13:25.873
to the trial judge.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.340
This isn't law school, Casey.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.209
This is the real world.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.410
Pick your battles.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.981
Winning the trial is more
important than wearing a skirt.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.585
TAFT:
If there are
no other matters,

13:38.618 --> 13:40.320
let's start jury selection
tomorrow morning.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.354
Amenable?

13:41.388 --> 13:43.323
No conflicts, Your Honor.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.125
That's fine, Your Honor.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.028
It's so nice when
we can all get along.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.997
Assault One
seems reasonable,

13:50.030 --> 13:53.633
but we're not overreaching with
the attempted murder charge,

13:53.666 --> 13:54.601
are we, Ms. Novak?

13:54.634 --> 13:59.039
The grand jury didn't think so,
Your Honor.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.909
Fine, just wanted to be sure.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.377
Actually, Your Honor, the
defense has one more matter.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.180
My client would like to waive
her right to a jury trial

14:07.214 --> 14:09.282
in favor of proceeding
before the court.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.550
Your Honor, this is strategy.

14:10.583 --> 14:14.187
People v. Williams, a waiver
can be denied if it's intended

14:14.221 --> 14:17.057
to seek an
impermissible
advantage.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.326
What advantage, Ms. Novak?

14:20.360 --> 14:24.231
Your perceived favor, sir.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.371
Waiving a jury trial
is more a risk to the defendant

14:31.404 --> 14:32.639
than the prosecution.

14:32.672 --> 14:36.076
Convincing 12 people
of guilt is harder

14:36.109 --> 14:38.211
than convincing
one judge.

14:38.245 --> 14:42.082
But if your client understands
the consequences

14:42.115 --> 14:44.351
of her waiver,
I'll grant it.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.321
I do, Your Honor.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.422
Very well.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.992
Then we proceed
directly to trial.

15:02.069 --> 15:05.038
Something else, Ms. Novak?

15:05.072 --> 15:07.240
Yes, sir.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.442
The People request
that Your Honor

15:09.476 --> 15:12.045
recuse himself
from this trial.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.485
On what grounds?

15:18.518 --> 15:23.123
That your conduct indicates a
clear bias toward the defense,

15:23.156 --> 15:25.325
recusing yourself now

15:25.358 --> 15:26.526
will preserve the appearance
of impartiality

15:26.559 --> 15:29.696
on the part
of this court.

15:31.498 --> 15:35.535
Judges are charged to examine
their conscience

15:35.568 --> 15:39.172
for any hint of bias and then
decide accordingly.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.340
Perhaps we should

15:40.373 --> 15:41.708
do that more often.

15:41.741 --> 15:45.012
I'm satisfied that
I'm impartial in this case.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.246
Your motion is denied,

15:46.279 --> 15:50.517
Ms. Novak, but I do
thank you for your candor.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.187
Opening arguments
tomorrow morning.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.089
( gavel pounds )

15:58.125 --> 15:59.526
You ask an egomaniac
to recuse himself?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.194
He has much as told
the defense

16:01.228 --> 16:03.096
that if they
waived the jury,
he'd acquit.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.364
"You're reaching

16:04.397 --> 16:07.100
with the attempted murder
charge, Ms. Novak?"

16:07.134 --> 16:08.368
What the hell is that?

16:08.401 --> 16:09.369
It's a tactic.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.571
He's trying to get you
to plead out the case

16:11.604 --> 16:14.141
and make his life easier.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.746
You're staying the trial?

16:19.779 --> 16:21.114
Why?

16:21.148 --> 16:22.782
To get Taft recused
or disqualified.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.752
I've got an appearance before an
appellate judge this afternoon.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.754
It's one thing to ask
for a recusal,

16:27.787 --> 16:29.522
but to publicly humiliate
a judge?

16:29.556 --> 16:32.592
You'll be the enemy in every
courtroom in Manhattan.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.528
I'm already the enemy
as far as Taft's concerned.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.331
The trial judge is
the sole arbiter of recusal.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.768
If Taft believes he's impartial,
the appellate term will have

16:41.801 --> 16:43.536
no reason to find otherwise.

16:43.570 --> 16:47.074
So a biased judge gets
to decide if he's biased?

16:47.074 --> 16:48.275
Yes.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.610
That's our legal system,
so work within it.

16:50.643 --> 16:54.814
Plead out the case
or you're looking at
an acquittal.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.782
Bad news travels fast.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.385
We have to plead
Karen Campbell out, Elliot.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.386
I have no choice.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.620
Don't be so sure.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.490
Records of the agency
the Campbells used
to adopt Alexis.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.824
Karen tried to give her back.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.126
When?

17:06.159 --> 17:07.594
February of this year.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.229
Six months after

17:09.262 --> 17:10.463
they adopted her.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.266
If she loved her so much, she
wouldn't hurt Alexis-- bull.

17:13.300 --> 17:17.104
Let's see Taft try
and throw this out.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.210
KAREN:
I was feeling overwhelmed
with the twins,

17:23.243 --> 17:24.811
I admit that.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.516
And I'm embarrassed
that I could even think about

17:29.549 --> 17:32.652
giving Alexis to someone else.

17:32.685 --> 17:37.290
But it was only because I
thought she'd be better off

17:37.324 --> 17:41.128
with a mother that could be
devoted to her.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.562
And you couldn't
do that?

17:42.595 --> 17:45.532
No.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.668
And if I'm guilty of anything,
it's of not being able

17:48.701 --> 17:51.304
to keep my eye
on her all the time.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.639
After you discovered

17:52.672 --> 17:57.144
that Alexis had gotten
into the detergent,

17:57.144 --> 17:58.611
how did she act?

17:58.645 --> 18:00.247
Fine,

18:00.280 --> 18:01.581
until she threw up.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.852
But my other daughter had had
the stomach flu the week before,

18:05.885 --> 18:07.320
and I had just thought

18:07.354 --> 18:08.855
that she caught it.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.191
And then she passed out.

18:11.224 --> 18:15.695
She turned blue.

18:15.728 --> 18:19.632
My husband came home from work
and we rushed her

18:19.666 --> 18:22.869
to the hospital.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.871
Thank you, Mrs. Campbell.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.673
Your witness.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.481
You say Alexis was fine all day?

18:34.514 --> 18:35.648
Yes.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.651
I'd like the court reporter
to read back the testimony

18:38.685 --> 18:40.453
of Dr. Langenhahn,
the pediatrician,

18:40.487 --> 18:41.588
regarding
the exact nature

18:41.621 --> 18:44.724
of Alexis's injuries.

18:44.757 --> 18:45.758
"Dr. Langenhahn:

18:45.792 --> 18:48.195
"The victim suffered
pneumonitis from vomiting

18:48.195 --> 18:50.197
"and then aspirating
the cleaning solution,

18:50.230 --> 18:51.698
causing her
to slowly suffocate."

18:51.731 --> 18:53.600
"Ms. Novak:

18:53.633 --> 18:55.902
"What symptoms would someone
with pneumonitis exhibit?"

18:55.935 --> 18:57.404
"Dr. Langenhahn:

18:57.437 --> 18:59.606
"Intense coughing,
labored breathing, vomiting.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.675
The victim would've
been in excruciating
pain for hours."

19:02.709 --> 19:05.312
"Excruciating pain for hours."

19:05.345 --> 19:08.315
Does that sound like
Alexis was fine?

19:08.348 --> 19:11.218
No, what the doctor said
is not true.

19:11.218 --> 19:11.951
Alexis was okay.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.620
You knew she'd
ingested

19:13.653 --> 19:15.255
cleaning solution
that afternoon.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.357
Why didn't you take her
to the hospital then?

19:17.390 --> 19:18.358
I didn't know how much.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.459
When you finally
did take her

19:19.492 --> 19:20.527
to the emergency room,
were you afraid

19:20.560 --> 19:22.695
the doctors might suspect
that you poisoned her?

19:22.729 --> 19:23.763
No.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.498
Isn't that why you delayed
getting your daughter

19:25.532 --> 19:26.699
medical attention, Ms. Campbell?

19:26.733 --> 19:28.768
Because you were more concerned
about getting in trouble,

19:28.801 --> 19:29.936
than saving
your daughter's life?

19:29.969 --> 19:32.372
No. I love Alexis.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.706
Objection; she's badgering.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.242
Sustained.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.516
Nothing further.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.524
There's little doubt
in anyone's mind

19:51.558 --> 19:53.993
that the events leading up
to Alexis Campbell's

19:54.026 --> 19:56.629
terrible injuries
are tragic and regrettable.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.997
No matter the outcome

19:58.030 --> 20:00.533
of these proceedings,

20:00.567 --> 20:03.303
a little girl will
never be the same.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.307
Mrs. Campbell,
please rise.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.349
After considering all the facts
and weighing the importance

20:16.383 --> 20:18.985
of the witness testimony,
I find that there is

20:19.018 --> 20:21.721
a single piece of evidence
that is paramount

20:21.754 --> 20:24.023
throughout this trial.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.992
And that is the fact

20:26.025 --> 20:29.329
that you love
your daughter.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.997
And because of that,

20:31.030 --> 20:32.699
I believe that
you did not force

20:32.732 --> 20:35.001
or encourage
her to drink

20:35.034 --> 20:37.837
a poisonous substance.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.772
This was a tragedy--

20:39.806 --> 20:43.710
in some ways, compounded
by this trial.

20:43.743 --> 20:49.015
I will not
compound it further.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.050
Not guilty on all charges.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.652
( gavel pounds )

20:58.057 --> 21:00.026
Thank you.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.341
I'm sorry.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.742
Don't be.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.578
Look, I know you went
to the mat on this one.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.713
Sometimes it just
doesn't work out.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.482
I want Taft off the bench.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.751
And I want a '65 Stingray.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.818
I'm serious.

21:25.852 --> 21:26.853
I'm going after him.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.655
Casey, it's not worth it.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.358
Look, what good does it
do anybody for you

21:31.358 --> 21:32.359
to kill your career?

21:32.392 --> 21:37.364
If this is justice,
I don't want this career.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.541
Casey, what's wrong?

21:48.575 --> 21:49.642
I need a favor.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.578
If this is about
Taft, forget it.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.112
I've been going through
his decisions

21:53.145 --> 21:54.213
over the past ten years.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.516
He's capricious, he disregards
procedure on a whim.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.485
He dismissed assault charges

21:58.518 --> 21:59.686
without a motion
and without a hearing,

21:59.719 --> 22:02.121
and he repeatedly
sets exorbitant bail
to force pleas.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.391
Casey, this is a
total waste of time.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.793
I and every attorney that
asked for Taft's recusal,

22:06.826 --> 22:08.761
they lose, including
another child poisoning case.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.930
The People vs. Rosalin Silvo.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.099
All right, let me see it.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.734
Here are the transcripts.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.736
Silvo takes her daughter
to the emergency room,

22:16.769 --> 22:18.938
she gets arrested for poisoning
her with antifreeze.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.840
She waives her jury
at the trial,

22:20.873 --> 22:22.409
Taft disallows

22:22.442 --> 22:23.943
an expert witness
who's going to testify

22:23.976 --> 22:25.878
that her daughter
has a genetic disease.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.815
Silvo's attorney asks
for Taft's recusal.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.684
Silvo's doing 25 to life.
Do you know what this is?

22:31.718 --> 22:33.820
You don't know
what this is.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.688
You have no idea what
the circumstances were.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.124
This is grounds
for getting his ass
thrown off the bench.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.091
I need you to call Jack Dryer

22:39.125 --> 22:40.960
at the State Commission
on Judicial Conduct

22:40.993 --> 22:41.928
and ask if anyone's filed

22:41.961 --> 22:45.164
any confidential complaints
against Taft.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.065
No. Absolutely not.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.867
You want to talk to Dryer,
be my guest.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.869
But I guarantee you
he's going to laugh you

22:49.902 --> 22:50.970
out of his office.

22:51.003 --> 22:54.173
I'm asking you
to make one phone call.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.443
And I'm telling you
that nothing you've shown me

22:56.443 --> 22:58.945
proves that Taft has done
anything unethical or improper.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.481
You find such proof,
bring it to me.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.883
Otherwise,
I'm done with this, Casey.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.588
Judge Taft is a pompous
son of a bitch.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.991
I left criminal law
because of him.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.092
What did he do?

23:13.125 --> 23:14.961
Well, for starters,
wrongfully convicted my client

23:14.994 --> 23:16.963
of a crime she didn't commit.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.499
Your expert witness
was ready to testify

23:19.532 --> 23:21.701
that her baby had
a rare disease.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.570
He was a genetics professor.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.739
He believed the antifreeze
evidence was a lab mistake.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.875
All I needed was the money
to pay for the test.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.810
And because you were
court-appointed,

23:30.843 --> 23:32.879
Judge Taft had to
approve all expenses.

23:32.912 --> 23:33.880
He called the test
junk science

23:33.913 --> 23:36.215
and wouldn't even let me
introduce the theory.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.617
Yeah, well, he's changed.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.619
The Taft I know is a
crusader for mothers.

23:39.652 --> 23:40.920
Oh, wait.
Let me guess.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.490
You prosecuted June Cleaver--

23:43.523 --> 23:46.225
wealthy, educated,
husband still in the picture?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.927
You think he's got
some kind of class bias?

23:47.960 --> 23:49.796
I think he's got
a real specific idea

23:49.829 --> 23:50.730
of what a good mother is

23:50.763 --> 23:52.765
and Rosalin Silvo
did not fit that mold--

23:52.799 --> 23:56.569
poor, uneducated, no husband,
two kids by two fathers.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.870
He thought she was a slut

23:57.904 --> 23:59.772
and he didn't even try
to hide his contempt.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.774
After he denied
my recusal motion,

24:01.808 --> 24:03.576
he let the word out
to other judges

24:03.610 --> 24:05.545
and all my referrals
dried up.

24:05.578 --> 24:08.781
I liked my job, but if I stayed
he would've ruined me.

24:08.815 --> 24:09.982
I'm getting Taft
off the bench.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.051
I need you to file a
joint complaint with me

24:12.084 --> 24:13.920
to the judicial commission.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.788
You're nuts.
I'm not going near this.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.590
So he puts an innocent
woman in jail

24:17.624 --> 24:18.825
and that's okay with you?

24:18.858 --> 24:20.960
Your office helped
put her in jail.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.530
Why don't you do something
to help get her out?

24:26.032 --> 24:29.636
August 2, 1993, Rosalin Silvo
shows up at St. Mary's ER

24:29.669 --> 24:31.671
with her one-year-old daughter
Christine.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.240
The baby was lethargic, vomiting

24:34.273 --> 24:36.976
and having difficulty
breathing.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.545
Docs ran tests and
found high levels

24:38.545 --> 24:40.547
of ethylene glycol
in her blood.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.948
That's the
active ingredient
in antifreeze.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.115
Christine was dead within hours,

24:43.149 --> 24:45.718
the hospital notified police
that she'd been poisoned.

24:45.752 --> 24:48.020
Rosalin was charged with murder.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.221
Who's this other kid?

24:49.255 --> 24:51.891
They found out that Silvo
was pregnant during her trial.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.059
Had the kid in prison.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.894
She's still in foster care.

24:54.927 --> 24:55.995
Here's the interesting thing.

24:56.028 --> 24:59.031
Cops never found antifreeze
at Silvo's apartment.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.266
She could have tossed it
on the way to the hospital.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.734
What did the M.E.'s office say?

25:01.768 --> 25:03.069
Confirmed the hospital's
finding.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.937
Autopsy showed crystals
in the baby's brain

25:04.971 --> 25:07.006
that could've been caused
by drinking antifreeze.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.575
And they never
turned up anything

25:08.608 --> 25:10.943
about this mystery
genetic disease?

25:10.977 --> 25:12.579
There was a preliminary hearing

25:12.612 --> 25:13.846
about some cousin
on the father's side

25:13.880 --> 25:15.314
who allegedly died
of the same disease.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.584
But the defense lawyer
couldn't find the dad,

25:17.584 --> 25:19.652
so Taft wouldn't allow the
information to be introduced.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.088
I'm all for getting
an innocent woman out of jail

25:22.121 --> 25:24.323
if she's innocent,
but we don't have

25:24.356 --> 25:26.125
the manpower to fuel
a vendetta, Casey.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.627
You know, Captain,
it's really

25:27.660 --> 25:28.861
not that much work.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.329
I think we can swing it.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.831
Well, thank you
for being

25:31.864 --> 25:33.332
such a real helper, Elliot.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.500
It's two interviews:
the mother

25:34.601 --> 25:37.637
and the genetics professor
who was supposed to testify.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.872
If nothing pans out,
I'll drop it.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.708
Make it quick.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.948
MUNCH:
Do you think Rosalin Silvo
was innocent, Dr. Calvin?

25:48.981 --> 25:49.982
Well, it was a theory.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.150
In the end, an untested one.

25:51.183 --> 25:53.853
But it was possible
her child had MMA,

25:53.886 --> 25:55.622
methylmalonic acidemia.

25:55.622 --> 25:56.623
What is it?

25:56.656 --> 25:57.624
The body lacks an enzyme

25:57.657 --> 25:59.692
to break down protein
for energy production.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.628
Untreated, it can be fatal.

26:01.628 --> 26:02.662
The girl was a year old
when she died.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.897
Wouldn't the mother have
known something was wrong?

26:04.931 --> 26:06.633
Symptoms often
don't appear

26:06.666 --> 26:08.167
for several months
to over a year.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.937
Why'd the hospital say
the baby was poisoned
with antifreeze?

26:10.970 --> 26:14.040
Their lab found what they
thought was ethylene glycol

26:14.073 --> 26:17.644
in the girl's blood,
using gas chromatography.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.946
But MMA produces a substance

26:19.979 --> 26:22.915
that the older
tests mistook for
ethylene glycol.

26:22.949 --> 26:25.017
Would a newer test be able
to tell the difference?

26:25.051 --> 26:26.385
Definitely.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.155
I just never got
the chance to use it.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.690
SILVO:
I kept waiting for someone

26:30.723 --> 26:32.191
to figure it out, you know?

26:32.224 --> 26:33.793
That it was
all a mistake.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.094
Don't get your hopes up yet.

26:35.127 --> 26:35.962
There's no guarantee

26:35.995 --> 26:36.963
our investigation
will get you out.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.866
I know. And it's okay
if you think I'm guilty.

26:39.899 --> 26:43.135
I probably would
if I were you.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.738
I think my daughter
does sometimes.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.807
You want to see
her picture?

26:47.840 --> 26:48.975
Sure.

26:49.008 --> 26:52.211
She's about what,
ten now, right?

26:52.244 --> 26:53.913
Diana.

26:53.946 --> 26:57.684
She's living
with a real nice
foster family.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.152
Writes me letters and
visits once in a while,

27:00.186 --> 27:01.988
but I don't know
if that's so good.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.190
This place isn't
right for a kid.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.826
Your lawyer thinks
that Christine died

27:06.859 --> 27:08.394
of a rare disease.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.730
What do you think?

27:10.763 --> 27:12.832
She must have.
She died.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.701
BENSON:
Was she sick a lot?

27:14.734 --> 27:20.773
No, she was fussy sometimes,
but mostly she was very happy.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.709
Maybe I wasn't
paying attention.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.944
But she was sick when you
took her to the hospital.

27:24.977 --> 27:29.148
She was throwing up and
she wasn't breathing right.

27:29.181 --> 27:32.118
Everybody at the hospital
was really nice to me

27:32.151 --> 27:33.886
until they did the tests.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.423
They started talking about
antifreeze and poisoning,

27:37.456 --> 27:38.858
and I'm thinking,

27:38.891 --> 27:43.462
"My God, who would
do this to my baby?"

27:43.495 --> 27:46.999
Then the cops showed up
and arrested me.

27:47.033 --> 27:50.002
Christine died while they
were taking my mug shots.

27:55.174 --> 28:00.813
We would like your permission
to exhume Christine's body.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.248
Now, if there is any chance

28:02.281 --> 28:03.883
of proving that she
wasn't murdered,

28:03.916 --> 28:08.855
that's what's
got to be done.

28:08.888 --> 28:12.124
Diana asks me about her.

28:12.158 --> 28:16.763
I tell her Christine
smiled all the time.

28:16.796 --> 28:19.766
That's what I like to remember.

28:19.766 --> 28:23.903
Not all this.

28:23.936 --> 28:27.473
Make sure they're
good to her, okay?

28:32.311 --> 28:33.445
WARNER:
We got lucky.

28:33.479 --> 28:36.783
Enough DNA from hair to test
for the genetic mutation.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.284
Did the baby have MMA?

28:38.317 --> 28:39.385
Without a doubt.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.288
But MMA doesn't explain
the calcium oxalate crystals

28:42.321 --> 28:44.791
the medical examiner found
in the brain.

28:44.791 --> 28:47.193
These head CTs
were in her medical records.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.962
The crystallization
is consistent

28:49.996 --> 28:51.831
with ethylene glycol poisoning.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.499
Okay, so where did
they come from?

28:53.532 --> 28:57.069
The hospital treated the baby
with an ethanol drip.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.538
Right thing to do
for antifreeze poisoning,

28:59.571 --> 29:03.209
exactly the wrong thing to do
for a child with MMA.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.344
The ethanol caused
the crystals to form

29:05.377 --> 29:07.546
and more than likely killed her.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.948
In other words, Rosalin Silvo

29:08.981 --> 29:12.919
just spent ten years
in prison for nothing.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.963
I don't know how
I can be more clear.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.232
Rosalin Silvo is innocent.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.968
Here's the M.E.'s report.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.337
Judge Taft let his bias
run that courtroom.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.105
He pulled the same crap
he always pulls,

29:33.139 --> 29:36.242
only this time
he stole a woman's life.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.344
That son of a bitch.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.246
Seems to be the preferred way
to describe this guy.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.113
It's a disgrace.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.115
He's an embarrassment
to the bench.

29:43.149 --> 29:44.350
I'll worry about him

29:44.383 --> 29:47.119
as soon as I get
Rosalin Silvo out of jail.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.388
She's going to need
a defense attorney.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.123
I'll take her case.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.292
I'll have to write up the
4-40 motion right away.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.896
I already did it for you.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.136
As stated in our brief,

30:04.170 --> 30:06.072
we believe we have found
sufficient evidence,

30:06.105 --> 30:08.307
previously unavailable at trial,

30:08.340 --> 30:10.977
proving the innocence
of my client.

30:13.312 --> 30:17.049
Furthermore, the opportunity
to obtain that evidence

30:17.083 --> 30:20.920
was denied to the defense
by Judge Taft.

30:20.953 --> 30:25.324
Justice in this case was not
only blind, it was cruel.

30:25.357 --> 30:28.060
Ms. Novak,
where do the People stand?

30:28.094 --> 30:30.029
Your Honor, we're joining
the defense's motion

30:30.062 --> 30:32.865
and ask that the court set aside
Ms. Silvo's conviction.

30:32.899 --> 30:36.368
After reviewing the motion,
I must concur with counsel.

30:36.402 --> 30:39.605
The only possible remedy
is to vacate

30:39.638 --> 30:41.273
Ms. Silvo's conviction.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.942
We're adjourned.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.110
( gavel bangs )

30:44.143 --> 30:45.844
Thank you.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.318
Well, Judge Clark, it's nice

30:52.351 --> 30:54.921
to see you haven't forgot
your meager beginnings

30:54.954 --> 30:57.890
as a legal aid attorney.

30:57.924 --> 30:58.958
Ms. Novak,

30:58.991 --> 31:00.359
are you going to be
combing through

31:00.392 --> 31:02.661
all the decisions
I've made?

31:02.694 --> 31:04.096
Because I can get the files,
if you'd like.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.297
That depends.

31:05.331 --> 31:06.465
How many other defendants

31:06.498 --> 31:07.733
have you falsely convicted?

31:07.766 --> 31:11.270
History is full of mistakes, Ms.
Novak, even your short history.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.939
You're not threatening her,
are you?

31:12.972 --> 31:14.941
Some people might find that
conduct unbecoming

31:14.974 --> 31:15.942
of an officer of the court.

31:15.942 --> 31:21.113
You can't bully your way
out of this, Oliver.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.688
That almost makes me
miss all this.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.490
( cell phone rings )
I don't know,

31:31.523 --> 31:33.425
I think you'd miss
your expense account more.

31:33.459 --> 31:34.961
Casey Novak.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.100
Oh, God.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.434
( sirens wailing )

31:46.538 --> 31:48.240
Why wasn't she
in the hospital?

31:48.274 --> 31:49.375
Released.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.310
Her parents didn't want
to put her in a nursing home.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.411
The aunt dropped by for a visit,

31:52.444 --> 31:54.246
found Alexis in
her bed, already dead.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.982
Karen was the
only one home.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.249
She finished the job.

31:57.283 --> 31:58.450
You have the right
to remain silent.

31:58.484 --> 32:01.120
If you give up that right,
anything you say can and will

32:01.153 --> 32:02.454
be used against you
in a court of law.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.290
You have the right
to an attorney.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.458
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you...

32:14.433 --> 32:16.135
STABLER:
So, here we are again.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.205
What happened,
you miss us?

32:19.238 --> 32:22.008
Look, Karen, I'm really
just looking...

32:24.143 --> 32:25.211
...for the explanation.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.179
I mean,
you had the perfect out.

32:27.213 --> 32:29.748
You just place Alexis
in a nursing home,

32:29.781 --> 32:32.384
you never even have
to think about her again.

32:32.418 --> 32:36.222
I'm trying to understand
why you had to kill her.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.323
Detective,
you do understand

32:37.356 --> 32:39.391
the child was severely
brain damaged from hypoxia.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.127
And that means
she deserved to die?

32:41.160 --> 32:42.628
That means she died
of injuries

32:42.661 --> 32:43.695
sustained from a prior

32:43.729 --> 32:45.164
accidental poisoning.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.133
That's convenient for you.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.067
It's also collateral estoppel.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.701
My client cannot be charged
with murder

32:49.735 --> 32:50.569
having been acquitted

32:50.602 --> 32:52.304
of attempting
the same alleged murder

32:52.338 --> 32:54.040
simply because
the child died.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.242
Unless we're talking
about two separate acts.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.576
Which we are, right, Karen?

32:59.711 --> 33:00.679
Alexis was suffocated.

33:00.712 --> 33:03.049
Poisoning had nothing
to do with her death.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.122
You got nothing
to say now, Karen?

33:10.156 --> 33:12.424
Come on, tell me what
a good mother you are.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.325
Better yet,

33:13.359 --> 33:15.461
tell me how it feels
to place a pillow

33:15.494 --> 33:17.563
over your daughter's face
and suffocate her.

33:17.596 --> 33:18.564
I didn't want to...

33:18.597 --> 33:19.798
You didn't
want to what?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.500
I didn't want to bring her home.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.103
Pete insisted.

33:24.136 --> 33:26.172
Yeah, and that's a lot
of responsibility.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.139
A sick baby.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.208
You had to take care of her,
all by yourself.

33:29.241 --> 33:30.509
She wouldn't stop crying.

33:30.542 --> 33:31.810
BENSON:
That's frustrating.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.379
I just wanted her to be quiet.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.081
STABLER:
So you killed her.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.515
You placed a pillow
over her face

33:36.548 --> 33:39.185
and you killed her, Karen.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.186
It wasn't my fault.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.520
What was it
an accident again?

33:41.553 --> 33:42.521
No.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.423
The judge said I should do it.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.525
It was his idea.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.094
What judge?

33:48.127 --> 33:49.561
Judge Taft.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.831
He said Alexis

33:52.864 --> 33:56.402
was too sick.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.104
I have other children

33:58.104 --> 33:59.438
to think about.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.440
He said, we would all be

34:01.473 --> 34:05.344
better off if Alexis just died.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.513
When did Judge Taft say
this to you?

34:07.546 --> 34:10.549
The other day,

34:10.582 --> 34:13.552
in court,
right before I testified.

34:13.585 --> 34:16.122
Interview is over,
everybody out.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.330
Did I hear her right?

34:24.363 --> 34:26.165
That nut case thinks the judge

34:26.198 --> 34:27.866
told her to murder her daughter?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.868
Or she thinks it's a good way
to get off a murder charge.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.002
STABLER:
What the hell
was Taft doing

34:31.036 --> 34:33.439
talking to a defendant alone,
during a trial, anyway.

34:33.472 --> 34:34.440
Hanging himself.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.541
We got the bastard now.

34:35.574 --> 34:36.475
Doesn't that nullify
her acquittal?

34:36.508 --> 34:38.310
NOVAK:
Sure does.
Not that it matters.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.578
We got her on homicide.

34:39.611 --> 34:40.646
I want to make this clear:

34:40.679 --> 34:43.449
I had no knowledge of this
ex parte communication

34:43.482 --> 34:45.651
and as an officer of the court,
I would've been duty-bound

34:45.684 --> 34:47.153
to inform you immediately.

34:47.153 --> 34:47.919
What did he say?

34:47.953 --> 34:49.521
Well, apparently
he saw her crying

34:49.555 --> 34:50.622
on the elevator at lunch.

34:50.656 --> 34:53.159
She alleges that he told her
that she had to think

34:53.159 --> 34:55.294
of her other children now
and that Alexis might be

34:55.327 --> 34:56.595
better off if she died, anyway.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.730
And Karen's using that
to justify killing her?

34:58.764 --> 35:00.899
Then he advised her
to get psychiatric help

35:00.932 --> 35:03.202
so that this tragedy
wouldn't happen again.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.670
He told her to get a shrink?

35:04.703 --> 35:06.338
That's what she said.

35:06.372 --> 35:09.175
And I think it's a fine idea.

35:09.208 --> 35:12.644
Uh, I've advised her not
to answer any more questions.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.547
Let's get her booked.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.583
After that, go pick up Taft.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.218
CRAGEN:
On what charges?

35:19.251 --> 35:21.720
Criminal Facilitation Two.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.489
Taft told Karen to get help,
which means

35:23.522 --> 35:25.524
he knew Alexis'
poisoning was no accident.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.626
He was afraid she'd try it
again with her other kids.

35:27.659 --> 35:30.229
Acquitting her gave her the
means and the opportunity

35:30.262 --> 35:31.430
to commit a Class A felony.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.665
He's protected by judicial
immunity, Casey.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.534
He smoked his
judicial immunity

35:35.567 --> 35:38.304
the second he had
an ex parte communication

35:38.337 --> 35:39.438
with the defendant.

35:41.573 --> 35:44.310
( mellow jazz playing )

35:44.343 --> 35:46.512
Excuse me.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.480
Excuse me.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.449
Detectives.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.618
If you wanted an invite,

35:52.651 --> 35:54.786
all you had to do was ask.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.688
We thought we'd class
the place up a little bit.

35:56.722 --> 35:59.258
You're going to need to step
outside with us, Judge Taft.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.259
Why?

36:00.292 --> 36:01.960
STABLER:
Just a private chat.

36:01.993 --> 36:02.961
About what?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.663
Alexis Campbell is dead.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.332
Karen suffocated her.

36:06.365 --> 36:09.601
You knew that she was
a danger to that little girl,

36:09.635 --> 36:10.669
and you let her go.

36:10.702 --> 36:11.770
This is absurd.

36:11.803 --> 36:12.838
Your Honor, you know

36:12.871 --> 36:17.243
the law says we can't arrest you
in your own home,

36:17.276 --> 36:20.446
so, if you want,
we could make a big scene.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.519
You all are going to be
very sorry for this.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.755
And you're going to look so
pretty for your mug shot.

36:37.028 --> 36:40.366
Docket Number 42768,
People v. Oliver Taft,

36:40.399 --> 36:43.402
Criminal Facilitation
in the Second Degree.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.970
What is this?

36:45.003 --> 36:45.837
Your Honor, the defendant
is being charged

36:45.871 --> 36:48.640
with knowingly
facilitating a murder.

36:48.674 --> 36:49.808
This is an outrage,
Your Honor.

36:49.841 --> 36:52.278
An overzealous ADA is upset
because she lost her case

36:52.278 --> 36:53.979
and is using the courts
to exact retaliation.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.281
He acted beyond
the scope

36:55.314 --> 36:56.915
of his position by communicating
ex parte

36:56.948 --> 37:00.552
with a woman who
later committed murder.

37:00.586 --> 37:01.953
JUDGE:
There's no grounds
for these charges.

37:01.987 --> 37:05.023
An acquittal does not constitute
aid to commit a felony.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.091
Your Honor...

37:06.124 --> 37:08.026
You're making a mockery
of this court, Ms. Novak.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.828
I'm throwing
the charges out.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.497
This is hubris and it reeks

37:11.530 --> 37:12.664
of professional misconduct.

37:12.698 --> 37:13.465
And you better believe

37:13.499 --> 37:14.966
Arthur Branch will hear
about it.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.569
The charges are dismissed,
Judge Taft,

37:17.603 --> 37:18.837
with my apologies.

37:18.870 --> 37:19.971
You're free to go.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.473
We're at recess.

37:21.507 --> 37:22.474
( gavel pounds )

37:25.611 --> 37:27.813
Well, I'll say this for you,
you've got balls.

37:27.846 --> 37:28.880
He probably won't get

37:28.914 --> 37:29.915
more than a censure

37:29.948 --> 37:31.950
from the Judicial Commission
for the ex parte.

37:31.983 --> 37:32.951
We'll see.

37:32.984 --> 37:33.952
And don't forget,

37:33.985 --> 37:35.821
now you've got
a star witness

37:35.854 --> 37:37.723
for Karen Campbell's
murder trial.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.798
Judge Taft, for the record,
you are here under a subpoena,

37:46.832 --> 37:49.034
which you unsuccessfully
tried to quash.

37:49.067 --> 37:51.069
That's correct.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.904
You presided over
Karen Campbell's

37:52.938 --> 37:54.005
attempted murder trial,

37:54.039 --> 37:56.575
in which she waived her right
to a jury, correct?

37:56.608 --> 37:57.643
I did.

37:57.676 --> 37:58.777
What was your verdict?

37:58.810 --> 37:59.778
Not guilty.

37:59.811 --> 38:00.979
Why?

38:01.012 --> 38:05.717
I felt the People had not
sufficiently proven their case

38:05.751 --> 38:06.418
against the defendant.

38:06.452 --> 38:07.819
So you think
she didn't try

38:07.853 --> 38:09.588
to kill her daughter
the first time.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.856
I believe
I already answered

38:10.889 --> 38:12.858
your question, counselor.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.560
Is that why you spoke
to Karen Campbell

38:14.593 --> 38:16.628
during her trial, because
you thought she was innocent?

38:17.729 --> 38:22.868
I admit the conversation with
the defendant was ill-advised.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.703
We were on the same elevator.

38:24.736 --> 38:27.706
She was distraught about
the condition of her daughter.

38:27.739 --> 38:31.743
I allowed my empathy
to overrule my intellect.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.779
Did it ever occur to you
that Karen Campbell might

38:33.812 --> 38:35.647
be responsible for her
daughter's condition?

38:35.681 --> 38:36.682
Your Honor,
I must object

38:36.715 --> 38:38.650
to this line of questioning.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.720
I'm here to discuss what I said
to the defendant,

38:41.753 --> 38:43.088
not to discuss my thoughts

38:43.121 --> 38:44.089
or feelings about her.

38:44.122 --> 38:45.090
On the contrary,
Your Honor.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.125
The defendant claims Judge Taft
instructed her

38:47.158 --> 38:48.126
to kill her daughter.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.695
It's important to establish

38:49.728 --> 38:50.762
the witness' state of mind

38:50.796 --> 38:52.831
at the time
of the conversation.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.933
Judge Taft,
answer the question.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.101
I will remind you

38:56.134 --> 38:58.637
that you have
no legal standing

38:58.670 --> 39:00.105
to object in this court.

39:00.138 --> 39:02.140
You felt sorry
for the defendant,

39:02.173 --> 39:05.076
so you must have decided that
she was innocent,

39:05.110 --> 39:07.846
even though the trial
hadn't yet concluded.

39:07.879 --> 39:08.847
That's not true.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.749
So you thought
she was guilty?

39:10.782 --> 39:13.819
I hadn't yet formed an opinion,
as you just said.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.555
The trial had not concluded.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.690
I know, which is why
it's so strange

39:18.724 --> 39:20.526
that you were talking to her.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.594
Why did you tell the defendant

39:22.628 --> 39:24.463
to seek
psychiatric help

39:24.496 --> 39:26.965
so this tragedy doesn't
occur again?

39:26.998 --> 39:29.435
She was upset.
Because it sounds

39:29.468 --> 39:31.470
like you think she really did
poison her daughter.

39:31.503 --> 39:32.438
It was a mistake.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.506
Is that what you
want me to say, Ms. Novak?

39:34.540 --> 39:36.542
One mistake in almost
three decades on the bench?

39:36.575 --> 39:38.677
Didn't you make another
arguably bigger mistake

39:38.710 --> 39:40.646
when you wrongfully convicted
Rosalin Silvo

39:40.679 --> 39:42.781
of murdering her daughter
and sent her to prison

39:42.814 --> 39:43.782
for ten years?

39:43.815 --> 39:45.484
That's a totally separate issue

39:45.517 --> 39:46.918
and completely immaterial
to this case.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.520
You can't object,
Judge Taft.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.622
JUDGE:
But I can, Ms. Novak.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.958
Get back to the case
at hand.

39:54.626 --> 39:57.463
Did you tell Karen Campbell
to suffocate her daughter?

39:57.496 --> 39:58.697
Absolutely not.

39:58.730 --> 40:01.500
But you talked to her, even
though it was clearly improper.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.300
It was a mistake.

40:02.468 --> 40:03.669
You don't make
mistakes, though.

40:03.702 --> 40:04.670
You make judgments.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.472
Who's innocent?
Who's guilty?

40:06.505 --> 40:08.674
You saw Rosalin Silvo
and she was a whore.

40:08.707 --> 40:09.975
That means she's a bad mother.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.777
And then you saw Karen Campbell.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.679
Why did you talk to her, Judge?

40:13.712 --> 40:14.680
Your Honor?

40:14.713 --> 40:15.681
Why talk
to Karen Campbell?

40:15.714 --> 40:16.982
Why talk to a woman
that tried

40:17.015 --> 40:18.016
to murder her daughter?

40:18.049 --> 40:19.651
I didn't know.
Didn't know what?

40:19.685 --> 40:21.853
That she'd turn around
and try to do it again?

40:21.887 --> 40:23.789
I thought they were good people!

40:23.822 --> 40:25.757
( gavel pounds )
That's enough.

40:25.791 --> 40:28.794
Ms. Novak, try that again
and you're in contempt.

40:28.827 --> 40:29.828
Sir, you will be

40:29.861 --> 40:32.664
as well,
if you don't sit down.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.600
Now.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.609
Nothing further.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.047
On the sole charge of murder
in the second degree,

40:49.080 --> 40:50.081
how do you find?

40:50.115 --> 40:52.183
We find the defendant guilty.

40:52.217 --> 40:53.952
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

40:53.985 --> 40:56.788
you've performed
your duties admirably.

40:56.822 --> 40:59.190
And I thank you
for your service.

40:59.224 --> 41:01.226
And may I say,
for the record,

41:01.259 --> 41:05.230
this is a crime
that could've
been prevented.

41:05.263 --> 41:07.699
While this trial exemplifies

41:07.733 --> 41:11.236
the very best aspects
of our legal system,

41:11.269 --> 41:13.539
it has also highlighted
its flaws.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.841
It is my sincere hope that in
the future,

41:15.874 --> 41:21.713
those flaws
can be corrected.

41:21.747 --> 41:24.716
The defendant will be held
over for sentencing.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.618
This court is adjourned.

41:26.652 --> 41:28.153
( gavel pounds )

41:45.336 --> 41:46.371
Your Honor, this way!

41:46.404 --> 41:48.607
The Chief Administrative Judge
says you're going

41:48.640 --> 41:50.609
to be reassigned to civil court.
What's your reaction?

41:50.642 --> 41:52.744
The previous conviction of
Rosalin Silvo was overturned,

41:52.778 --> 41:54.946
how many other of your verdicts
have come under scrutiny?

41:54.980 --> 41:56.047
What about the rumor
that the governor has asked

41:56.081 --> 41:58.984
the Judicial Commission
to investigate your conduct?
