00:34.040 --> 00:37.720
The latest serum
has surpassed expectations.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.400
The test subject
has grown five times normal size...

00:45.560 --> 00:49.600
within days of the serum
being introduced into its system.

00:56.560 --> 00:59.320
But the only known side effect
is aggressive behaviour...

00:59.480 --> 01:03.720
that requires constant feeding
to maintain a higher metabolic rate.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.920
For now, constant sedation
of the subject is needed...

01:07.080 --> 01:09.600
but the results are very promising.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.920
Regeneration only occurs...

01:28.120 --> 01:32.520
when there is immediate introduction
of the serum into the wounded area.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.760
My past attempts
to save older decomposed...

01:46.920 --> 01:50.200
or severely damaged tissue
have failed.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.760
The latest genetic modifications
to the black-orchid strain...

02:52.920 --> 02:56.200
have had the predicted effect
on the serum extract.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.080
The serum now successfully
provides the apparent benefit...

02:59.240 --> 03:01.960
of halting decomposition
of living tissue.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.640
This, of course,
would rev olutionise medicine...

03:04.800 --> 03:07.040
if properly applied.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.280
Mr. Murdoch is expecting you.
Right this way, sir.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.080
Come in.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.360
Sir, sorry to disturb you.
Mr. Eugene has arrived.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.520
- Send him in.
- Right away, sir.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.120
Come in, please.

05:08.720 --> 05:09.800
Sir.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.200
There's a briefcase over there.
Have a look inside.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.680
That's $1 million.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.880
It's yours if you'll do a little job
for me.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.440
- I'm listening.
- Sit.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.920
There's a cottage
in a forest not far from here...

05:33.080 --> 05:36.480
where an employee of mine has been
conducting certain experiments...

05:36.640 --> 05:40.520
the outcome of which
may be beneficial to my health.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.240
But here's the thing.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.960
We've lost contact with him.
He appears to have disappeared.

05:47.240 --> 05:51.440
- His experiments were successful?
- I believe so.

05:52.120 --> 05:56.240
I believe he created a new hybrid
of the blood orchid...

05:56.400 --> 05:59.840
extracted a serum from it,
and that the serum works.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.680
And that's why he's gone missing...

06:01.840 --> 06:05.000
because he has found
another employer.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.320
Now, I want you
to collect all the plant material...

06:08.480 --> 06:10.880
the serum, all his research notes.

06:11.040 --> 06:14.560
- Find him and kill him.
- Just one man?

06:15.200 --> 06:16.200
I should warn you...

06:16.360 --> 06:19.800
that some say he's one
of the smartest men on the planet.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.160
He may have one or two tricks
up his sleeve.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.600
This is a lot of money for one man.

06:27.080 --> 06:31.000
I have invested over $50 million
in this project...

06:31.160 --> 06:33.680
and the returns
could be incalculable.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.920
I want results
no matter what the cost.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.040
One other thing.

06:43.280 --> 06:48.160
There's a photo of a girl in there
who is also involved with the project.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.440
She knows too much.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.760
Should she cross your path...

06:53.920 --> 06:55.880
remove her from the equation.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.080
It would be my pleasure.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.720
That's what I wanted to hear.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.360
One other thing.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.640
Time is of the essence.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.440
I have bone cancer.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.400
Without this little concoction...

07:20.040 --> 07:22.640
I would be dead within the week.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.760
And that new serum
might change that?

07:28.120 --> 07:29.760
Well, that is my hope.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.320
Until I see you, sir.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.800
Good hunting.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.120
How the heck
am I supposed to read this?

10:08.960 --> 10:10.640
Hey, you.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.600
You lost?

10:15.160 --> 10:18.640
Oh, no, no, it's okay, we're...
They're officers.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.800
Well, I got a little turned around.
The map's in Romanian.

10:23.480 --> 10:27.400
You know, I saw something out there.
Something big.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.040
Wait, you see it or hear it?

10:31.200 --> 10:32.760
Both.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.480
All right, well,
why don't you just stick with us, okay?

10:40.280 --> 10:42.680
So, what's your story?

10:43.400 --> 10:45.200
I spend the summers
with my grandmother.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.320
She lives in a town nearby.
Are you guys all cops?

10:48.480 --> 10:50.320
I'm not. I study flowers.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.760
Flowers?
And you have two cops with you?

10:53.920 --> 10:56.160
What are you doing out here?

10:56.320 --> 10:59.920
Well, I'm studying for a career
in palaeopathology.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.720
People in town told me there was a dig
going on in these mountains...

11:03.880 --> 11:05.320
so I wanted to check it out.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.000
- Palaeo-what?
- The study of human ancient remains.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.920
Yeah, it's okay,
my friends don't understand it either.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.960
Wait. Wait a sec.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.280
- You hear that?
- No.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.600
When the forest goes quiet,
there's a predator near.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.480
- Come on.
- Are you serious?

11:24.680 --> 11:26.320
- What's your name again?
- Alex.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.640
I'm Amanda.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.240
You know,
you really shouldn't be out here alone.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.560
What the hell is that?

11:38.520 --> 11:42.200
Listen, you guys, we're too exposed.
We need to take cover. Come on.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.040
Yeah.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.520
So I'm working this dig with
this hotshot Ph. D. Who's on sabbatical.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.800
And he starts yapping to me
about his new methodology...

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
and how he's developed a tool
that allows him to dig faster...

11:54.160 --> 11:56.040
without damaging any artefacts.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.800
He also tells me
the way we do it is prehistoric...

11:58.960 --> 12:00.720
and nobody does it that way
anymore.

12:00.880 --> 12:01.880
So?

12:02.040 --> 12:04.080
- So I'm not done yet.
- "I'm not done yet."

12:04.240 --> 12:07.120
So hotshot,
he drags me over to his site.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.040
He hops down in the hole...

12:09.200 --> 12:12.920
and he immediately proceeds
to chop off two of his fingers...

12:13.080 --> 12:14.680
with this brand-new tool of his.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.400
That's a bit of a morbid story there,
Jackson.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.880
I was a little shocked myself.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.960
I did ask
if he was gonna leave fingers...

12:22.120 --> 12:24.640
for future generations to uncover.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.760
You were jealous
he could out-dig you.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.360
Well, I don't know about that, but he
can count to three faster than me.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.080
All right, come on, guys, let's focus.
We're not too far away.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.000
You know, if what they say is true...

12:37.160 --> 12:40.520
this could be one of the most
important discoveries on the continent.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.000
Roland, any news on your brother
or Team 1?

12:43.160 --> 12:44.800
No, haven't heard anything yet.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.520
Heather, nice tunes, honey.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.000
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.200
I can't help it.
I am a slave to the rhythm.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.200
I am a slave to the rhythm.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.160
I wanna take my clothes off.
I wanna...

13:10.320 --> 13:12.440
I wanna touch your body.

13:32.760 --> 13:36.040
Great. That's the last thing we need.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.960
Any way around it?

13:39.640 --> 13:42.720
- Let me look.
- Anyone pack a chain saw?

13:42.920 --> 13:46.640
- Well, we can use the rock chisels.
- Yeah, and we'd be here for days.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.080
No, no, this is the only route
to the base camp.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.240
Can we go off-road?

13:53.880 --> 13:55.840
I don't know.

13:57.280 --> 14:00.640
Yeah, we could go off.
We're not gonna get back on.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.600
All right, let's break it down.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.720
We haven't heard from Team 1
in two days.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.760
From the looks of this log,
they didn't come through here.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.400
We've had no radio,
no cell-phone communication.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.720
- Guess what, guys. We're walking.
- Are you crazy?

14:14.880 --> 14:18.040
- Jackson, it's five miles, man.
- We're walking, Heather.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.400
- Okay.
- Okay, listen up.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.360
Grab your packs and travel light.
We'll get to Team 1.

14:22.520 --> 14:26.040
In the morning, we'll come back,
use the equipment to move this tree.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.360
- Jackson.
- Yeah?

14:28.520 --> 14:29.800
Why don't you head out now?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.200
We'll hunt the rest of the gear
and we'll meet you halfway.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.440
- All right.
- Okay.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.280
- It's getting dark pretty fast.
- Well, let's move.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.360
Hey. Did you see that?

14:45.520 --> 14:47.120
- What?
- Did you hear?

14:49.760 --> 14:51.160
What?

14:54.880 --> 14:57.280
Hey, your eyes
are playing tricks on you.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.200
Come on. It's been a long drive.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.280
Let's get the rest of the gear
out of Jackson's Jeep.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.720
Hey, Alex, let's go check this out.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.320
- Vasile, you guys stay out here.
- Okay.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.560
- Want a flashlight?
- I've got one.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.320
Oh, my God,
I can't believe he did this.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.640
Flowers.

15:38.680 --> 15:41.560
No, you don't understand.
I've been looking for these flowers.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.440
Hybrids, probably twice the potency.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.120
Get back.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.280
Here, you know how to use this?

15:59.240 --> 16:01.560
- That was just the wind, right?
- Maybe.

16:06.360 --> 16:10.520
- What the hell are you doing?
- Don't ask questions.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.520
You're gonna blow this place up?

16:13.720 --> 16:16.800
- Do you know how to use that stuff?
- I know what I'm doing.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.840
Put an end to these flowers,
hopefully, I'll put an end to it.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.440
- An end to what?
- How'd you get here?

16:22.600 --> 16:24.040
- My Jeep, why?
- We'll need it.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.960
We've gotta get about a 100 yards
before I blow this place...

16:33.360 --> 16:35.040
Let's go, come on.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.640
Move. Get in front of me. Move.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.280
- What about your friends?
- They're probably dead.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.400
- Amanda, what the hell is going on?
- Just...

16:45.560 --> 16:47.600
You have no idea. Just keep moving.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.920
Keep going, kid. I'm right behind you.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.080
- Where the hell were you?
- Right here.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.840
Come on, there's a way out.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.560
Amanda.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.760
Amanda.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.000
Don't worry, I'll get help.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.120
If the forest goes quiet,
there's a predator near.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.520
Hey.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.800
Hello?

20:09.720 --> 20:11.400
Hello?

20:22.360 --> 20:23.920
Guys?

20:37.840 --> 20:40.720
Is there anybody here?

21:00.880 --> 21:02.920
Oh, God.

21:09.240 --> 21:11.200
- Where the hell is Jackson?
- Probably lost.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.880
- I'll kill him if he is.
- Wait, wait, wait.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.400
- What?
- I've got movement.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.240
- Where?
- Over there.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.640
I don't see anything.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.880
Okay, I'm gonna check it out.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.080
- You brought a gun?
- I'll come with you.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.680
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Don't worry.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.960
We're just gonna check it out.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.000
- What are you doing, man?
- Hey, it's Jackson, it's me.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.720
- Jackson.
- Jackson.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.400
- What happened to you?
- What happened?

21:53.560 --> 21:55.920
- What's wrong?
- They're dead.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.840
- Who's dead?
- What do you mean, dead?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.040
- Who's dead?
- Team 1. They're all dead.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.400
Man, we've gotta get out of here.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.440
- Who's dead exactly?
- What do you mean?

22:05.600 --> 22:10.040
I didn't stop and check their wallets.
Whatever killed them is still out there.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.000
- Let's go. We gotta go.
- Just calm down.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.560
- We're too far. Let's get to base camp.
- They are dead at base camp!

22:15.760 --> 22:18.040
Will you calm down five seconds?

22:18.200 --> 22:21.360
Look, we're too far in.
We'll get to base camp.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.520
At the least, we'll get their vehicles,
get a satellite phone...

22:24.680 --> 22:26.720
and send out
an emergency broadcast.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.880
- You're wrong.
- I'm right. We're too far in.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.200
- Now let's move.
- Come on.

22:30.360 --> 22:31.720
No.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.840
- Come on.
- Come on, let's go.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.400
Come on.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.920
Everyone stay together.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.480
Listen up, ladies.

23:16.680 --> 23:19.520
These are the targets:
Peter, Amanda.

23:24.920 --> 23:28.360
Come on, Sal, join the club. All right.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.040
He's in a cottage near here.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.360
We find him,
we get what we're looking for...

23:32.520 --> 23:33.560
we clean house.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.960
She is classified "shoot on sight."

23:36.400 --> 23:38.560
- What a waste.
- Yes, indeed.

23:38.760 --> 23:40.600
Be careful, do as I say...

23:40.800 --> 23:43.920
and with any luck,
we'll be out of the forest by daybreak.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.880
Come on, gentlemen.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.960
Looks like we've got company.

23:57.320 --> 24:00.720
- This fire's at least a day old.
- They're gone. The bodies are gone.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.680
- There's nothing missing.
- That's a good thing, right?

24:04.760 --> 24:07.440
- Maybe.
- Like hell it is.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.280
Hey. Hey.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.040
There were bodies here today.
I saw them.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.720
Now, what about that is not sinking in
with you people?

24:14.880 --> 24:16.920
Jackson, nobody's saying you didn't.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.960
For all we know, Team 1
could've been transporting the bodies.

24:20.120 --> 24:21.680
Oh, come on.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.480
It wouldn't take the whole group
to take them.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.840
Somebody would be here.
They're not out working.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.960
They don't have equipment
to work at night.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.640
- Where are they, huh? Where?
- Then we have to go looking for them.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.000
- The site is up that hill.
- And we will, but not until sunup.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.200
Not tonight.
We'll be no good to them if we get lost.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.000
- I'll go alone.
- You go, we all go.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.560
But let me tell you something.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.320
If there is something out there...

24:44.480 --> 24:46.960
chances are,
it'll have the advantage at night.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.720
- True.
- Tonight we all play it safe.

24:49.880 --> 24:53.040
We stay in one hut,
and we rotate lookouts.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.640
I know what I saw.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.080
Jackson.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.760
Jackson.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.920
- Hey.
- You scared me.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.200
I think I saw something out there.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.440
- Where?
- I don't know, there.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.960
I must be hearing things.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.120
You see anything?

27:28.120 --> 27:33.120
No. I know, I know.
I should have stayed inside.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.920
I don't know.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.320
Look, I don't know
what's going on here...

27:43.480 --> 27:45.840
but I know what I saw today.

27:46.680 --> 27:50.960
And I got a pretty good idea of what
we're gonna find at the site tomorrow.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.400
And I don't want you
to be a part of that.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.040
Tomorrow I want you and Wendy
to take the van and go back down.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.040
Oh, come on, why?
Because we're girls?

28:01.240 --> 28:05.160
No, no, not because you're girls.
Listen, this isn't some kind of contest.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.480
- Yeah, but...
- Hey.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.040
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.800
I care about you too much.

28:24.560 --> 28:29.080
Remind me again,
why do we have to keep this a secret?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.440
You know what? We don't.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.840
- We don't, right?
- No.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.280
- What?
- Something bit me.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.640
- Something bit me.
- What?

28:42.920 --> 28:45.040
- Oh, man, something nailed you.
- It stings.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.760
- You okay?
- Yeah, it just stings.

28:47.920 --> 28:52.000
- Let's go in and get something on that.
- Yes, clean it out.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.600
What was it? You got any idea?

28:57.120 --> 28:58.960
You all right?

28:59.120 --> 29:00.960
Not really.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.120
Alex.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.960
Alex?

29:59.640 --> 30:01.760
Alex.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.920
Oh, my God,
I can't believe he did this.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.600
Hey.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.520
Hey there.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.960
You okay?

31:00.120 --> 31:03.480
Not so good, no.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.880
- Let's do this.
- Do what?

31:08.080 --> 31:11.160
Heather,
you were bitten by a hobo spider.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.720
They're poisonous,
but they're not deadly.

31:14.920 --> 31:18.440
- Well, it hurts.
- I know it does, honey.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.480
- But it'll pass, I promise.
- Yeah, well, it better.

31:27.880 --> 31:31.320
The area around the bite
is filled with poison.

31:33.480 --> 31:37.800
I'm gonna make a tiny incision
to drain it out.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.200
It'll make your fever drop
much quicker.

31:41.040 --> 31:44.360
- You know what you're doing, right?
- Yeah.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.080
- I know what I'm doing.
- You ready?

31:47.840 --> 31:49.600
As I'll ever be.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.280
Okay.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.440
Okay.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.520
Come on. Come on.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.160
- Here.
- Thanks.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.960
You're okay, you're okay.

32:11.520 --> 32:14.200
Okay, hang on, hang on.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.520
Okay, okay. Easy, easy.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.080
It's okay, it's okay.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.440
Hold still, hold still, hold still.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.400
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.400
How is she?

32:48.560 --> 32:51.680
- She's fine, honey.
- Oh, thank God.

32:52.200 --> 32:55.320
- Got a cup of coffee?
- No, but you can have mine.

32:55.480 --> 32:58.760
- Oh, you're a doll. Cheers.
- No problem.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.920
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.640
Listen, we're gonna go
to the excavation site...

33:09.800 --> 33:11.360
see if we can find anyone.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.280
Wendy's gonna stay here with you,
okay?

33:13.440 --> 33:14.760
Okay.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.040
I'm gonna leave this radio.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.160
If you need to talk to me
for any reason, you call, okay?

33:20.320 --> 33:22.400
I'm on channel three.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.160
They've got it. Let's go.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.560
Keep an eye on your temperature.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.200
If it goes above a 102,
you're gonna call me.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.320
Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry.

33:34.520 --> 33:37.960
- You're gonna call me, right?
- Don't worry.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.120
Listen, you be careful out there,
okay?

33:43.920 --> 33:45.320
Yeah.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.200
I don't know what we're gonna find...

34:04.360 --> 34:07.120
but I'd be prepared for the worst.

34:07.640 --> 34:11.199
Yeah. For Roland's sake,
I hope you're wrong.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.400
Great.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.320
Wendy?

34:44.120 --> 34:45.800
Wendy?

34:47.600 --> 34:50.040
Oh, great.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.880
Wendy?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.680
The site should be just over there
to the right somewhere.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.280
Where'd you get that?

36:23.440 --> 36:25.240
- What, the map?
- Yeah.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.400
Found it in one of the huts.
Team 1 must have made it.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.560
- It's not much further, right?
- Shouldn't be.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.280
Look, I know you're worried
about your brother.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.760
And I wish there was something
I could do.

36:38.920 --> 36:41.640
He's okay. I would feel it if he wasn't.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.280
Roland, Jackson, get over here.

37:10.080 --> 37:13.600
Oh, my God. Jackson! Scott!

37:19.520 --> 37:21.520
Oh, God.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.400
Come on, you big bag of slime.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.120
Oh, no.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.800
- Run! It's behind you!
- I know. Go. Run, come on.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.920
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.280
Came from somewhere over there.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.400
Roland.

41:07.480 --> 41:09.280
Move out, move out.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.520
Listen,
I think there's a clearing up ahead.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.760
- Son of a...
- What is that?

41:33.040 --> 41:34.520
I didn't sign on for this.

41:41.240 --> 41:42.240
What the...?

41:44.080 --> 41:46.600
Those people
are never gonna make it.

41:48.360 --> 41:49.800
I gotta do something.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.680
- Roland, get back here.
- Roland, no.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.280
- Jackson...
- Roland, get back.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.880
- Jackson, no.
- Roland!

41:55.080 --> 41:56.520
Jackson, wait!

41:58.920 --> 42:01.080
- God, get off me.
- Roland!

42:01.280 --> 42:02.760
- Roland!
- Back, back.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.720
No, don't go, don't go.
What are you, crazy?

42:05.920 --> 42:07.640
- Come on, get back here.
- Turn around.

42:07.840 --> 42:10.360
Roland! Roland, no!

42:22.400 --> 42:24.440
No!

42:30.240 --> 42:32.960
That's Amanda. Take her out.

42:33.160 --> 42:35.520
There's nothing we can do. Come on.

42:36.200 --> 42:39.040
- It's coming.
- Go, go, run. Run!

42:40.960 --> 42:43.240
What about that thing out there?

42:43.840 --> 42:46.160
If it attacks, we engage.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.000
Move.

42:48.880 --> 42:49.880
Wait, let's split up.

42:50.040 --> 42:52.560
Okay, you, come with me.
You guys go that way.

42:52.720 --> 42:54.760
Go, go, go.

43:28.680 --> 43:29.960
Jeez, Wendy, where were you?

43:30.120 --> 43:32.840
- I heard somebody back there.
- Yeah, I heard somebody too.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.720
- I thought it was you.
- Are you okay?

43:34.880 --> 43:37.320
Yeah, I'm fine, I just woke up and...

43:37.520 --> 43:39.640
- Oh, God.
- Patrick!

43:44.600 --> 43:45.800
Oh, my God.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.560
- Oh, my God, Patrick.
- Patrick.

43:47.760 --> 43:51.440
Don't say anything. Just relax.
Don't speak, don't try anything.

43:51.640 --> 43:55.000
Try to tie his wound or something.
Oh, my God.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.840
- Stay calm.
- Try and tie his wound.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.160
Heather, we need Scott.
Get Scott. We need him.

43:59.320 --> 44:02.920
- I'll go get Scott. I'll call him.
- Hurry, we need him right now.

44:03.080 --> 44:05.480
- Wait.
- Hold on, we're getting help.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.760
- Just relax, calm down.
- Scott, we need you here.

44:08.920 --> 44:12.600
We've got Patrick here. He's injured.
We need you. We're not trained for this.

44:12.760 --> 44:15.400
Oh, my God. Patrick... Scott.

44:15.600 --> 44:18.480
Scott, please come in, please.
Oh, my God.

44:18.680 --> 44:22.400
Come on, he's behind us, I know it.
He's coming.

44:24.360 --> 44:27.360
- Okay, we'll confuse it.
- He's coming, I know he's coming.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.760
Go left, go left. We'll confuse it.

44:43.720 --> 44:46.200
Wait for the girl. She's the target.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.480
There.

44:57.280 --> 44:58.760
Get down.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.200
Life is hard, huh?

45:23.280 --> 45:24.800
Life is hard, huh?

45:44.200 --> 45:45.360
- It's okay.
- What is that?

45:45.520 --> 45:48.800
Your friends, bring me to them
if you want them safe. Come on.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.320
Is there anybody out there?
Can anybody read me?

45:51.800 --> 45:54.880
Come on. Come on.
Somebody, anybody, please.

45:55.040 --> 45:57.040
- I'm not getting anything.
- Keep trying.

45:57.240 --> 45:59.840
- I'm trying. How is he?
- Bad.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.800
Scott, please, somebody.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.200
Can anybody read me?

46:13.360 --> 46:15.800
- Is there anybody out there? Come on.
- Hey.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.960
Check it out.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.600
- Please, can anyone read me?
- Forest Service, what's your location?

46:23.160 --> 46:24.720
- I'm getting something.
- Really?

46:25.160 --> 46:28.160
Yeah, we're at a base camp
near a cornfield or something.

46:28.320 --> 46:31.000
We're part of the archaeological team
working in the area.

46:31.160 --> 46:34.200
- We need medical help right away.
- Wendy! Heather!

46:35.560 --> 46:38.320
Jackson? Where the hell were you?

46:38.520 --> 46:40.920
- Where's Scott? Pat needs a medic.
- Oh, my God.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.360
Jesus.

46:43.520 --> 46:44.720
Wendy, get me the med kit.

46:44.920 --> 46:46.960
- It's in the tent right behind you.
- Okay.

46:47.160 --> 46:48.960
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.560
Here you go.

46:55.720 --> 46:57.800
- Let me help you.
- Find the keys to the Jeep.

46:57.960 --> 47:01.120
- We're getting him out of here.
- Okay, I can do that. Be right back.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.000
- We'll wait here.
- Is there something I can do to help?

47:04.840 --> 47:06.440
I don't know.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.840
Where are they?

47:12.480 --> 47:13.480
Where are they?

47:17.640 --> 47:19.840
Murdoch residence.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.280
Yes, just a second, please.

47:22.880 --> 47:26.200
Mr. Murdoch,
Eugene is on the phone.

47:28.760 --> 47:29.960
Murdoch.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.800
- I found the cottage.
- And?

47:33.000 --> 47:34.840
You didn't say anything
about the snake.

47:36.440 --> 47:39.600
Well, I told you he might have
a few tricks up his sleeve.

47:39.760 --> 47:42.560
That's the understatement
of the year.

47:42.720 --> 47:45.080
I had no idea what we could expect.

47:45.560 --> 47:48.680
Ten million, and an extra million
for taking out the girl.

47:48.880 --> 47:50.760
Forget the girl.
Do you have the serum?

47:50.920 --> 47:54.560
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.960
Tell your man to meet me.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.880
I'll be ready.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.960
It's all set. Let's go.

48:05.680 --> 48:07.880
Wendy. Wendy, it's okay, it's okay.

48:08.080 --> 48:10.960
- Scott showed up. He's got the keys.
- Okay.

48:11.120 --> 48:13.040
- I think Patrick's stabilised.
- Right.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.200
Let's grab our gear
and get out of here.

48:16.200 --> 48:20.280
- We have to leave now, come on.
- Look at me. Look at me.

48:20.440 --> 48:21.920
Who are you?

48:22.080 --> 48:25.800
I am responsible
for what you saw back there, all right?

48:25.960 --> 48:27.720
Trust me, we've gotta get out of here.

48:27.880 --> 48:31.360
- Trust you? You want me to trust you?
- Yeah.

48:31.520 --> 48:34.040
You know what we just saw out there?
What is it?

48:34.200 --> 48:36.200
- Some kind of an experiment?
- Exactly.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.600
Those men that you saw
are here to get the serum.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.760
- What serum?
- They can't have any witnesses.

48:40.920 --> 48:43.160
Do you understand?
We have to get out of here.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.400
- They would kill us?
- Why not?

48:46.720 --> 48:48.080
It's the cleanest option.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.120
Her.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.320
You.

48:57.480 --> 48:59.720
You seem to be of a certain value
to my client...

48:59.880 --> 49:03.000
so I'm going to ask you
a few questions, if I'm allowed.

49:03.200 --> 49:04.320
I'll take that.

49:05.960 --> 49:08.120
I'm looking for...

49:08.280 --> 49:12.400
I'm looking for a serum
which I'm sure you know about.

49:13.480 --> 49:14.480
Sorry.

49:15.600 --> 49:18.640
Don't. Don't waste my time.

49:34.640 --> 49:36.920
Tell me about this man.

49:40.520 --> 49:43.360
What? I didn't hear you.

49:43.840 --> 49:45.440
Tell me that again.

49:46.920 --> 49:50.720
Okay. He's a scientist
that captured a snake.

49:50.880 --> 49:53.400
Good. Where is he now?

49:59.280 --> 50:01.400
- Answer the question.
- I don't know.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.360
I've been looking for him myself.

50:18.120 --> 50:19.680
To do what?

50:19.840 --> 50:22.480
To destroy everything
that he's created.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.840
Lucky for us, you didn't, right?

50:27.000 --> 50:30.920
It's gonna pretty be difficult for you
to go get that serum with that thing.

50:31.080 --> 50:33.960
- Who?
- You guys are gonna die if you try.

50:34.120 --> 50:38.520
If that's the case,
you are going to go get it for us.

50:38.680 --> 50:41.600
Really?
Why would I do something like that?

50:48.840 --> 50:50.240
- Hey.
- Patrick.

50:54.080 --> 50:55.440
- Patrick!
- What are you doing?

50:55.600 --> 50:58.920
What? I make him a favour.
He's not suffering anymore.

50:59.920 --> 51:01.040
- Wendy, no!
- Jackson, no.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.600
- Wendy!
- Wendy, no!

51:08.720 --> 51:10.760
- No!
- Jackson, no.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.400
- Jackson.
- I am gonna kill you...

51:13.560 --> 51:15.320
the first chance I get.

51:15.480 --> 51:18.280
- Jackson, no.
- Let him go. I'm liking this.

51:18.440 --> 51:20.320
- You hear me? You are dead.
- Jackson, no.

51:20.480 --> 51:23.520
Damn you, you are... God.
God, God, why?

51:24.000 --> 51:25.880
- Jackson, no.
- God.

51:26.920 --> 51:28.600
Hey, hey, hey.

51:28.760 --> 51:33.160
Listen. You two, 10 minutes.
You are leaving in 10 minutes.

51:33.320 --> 51:36.360
You heard what she said.
That thing will kill us.

51:36.560 --> 51:37.960
Maybe, but trust me...

51:38.120 --> 51:41.000
you and your team's chances
of living are better if you go.

51:41.160 --> 51:44.400
Now, I'll send my men
to make sure you don't lose your way.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.080
Go.

51:47.880 --> 51:51.000
Heather, Heather,
come here, come here, come here.

51:51.160 --> 51:52.720
I got you, I got you.

51:52.880 --> 51:56.440
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

51:57.480 --> 51:59.440
It's okay, it's okay.
Let's go, come on.

52:02.280 --> 52:04.200
Come on. Please, just come with me.

52:04.360 --> 52:07.320
Just stay with her.
Just calm her down, okay?

52:07.920 --> 52:10.800
Okay, I got you.
Come on, we're gonna go.

52:10.960 --> 52:12.960
Come on, let's go.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.480
Hope you guys pack light...

53:01.640 --> 53:03.120
in case we gotta move fast.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.560
- Take care of yourself, kid.
- I will.

53:06.600 --> 53:11.040
- You think we'll get away with this?
- Truth? Probably not.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.080
I'm here.

53:32.400 --> 53:34.560
So let me ask you something.

53:35.520 --> 53:37.920
What's this research about?

53:38.960 --> 53:43.080
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah, I really wanna know.

53:43.720 --> 53:48.560
Longevity, immortality,
the fountain of youth.

53:50.040 --> 53:54.480
Somebody took this orchid
and genetically enhanced it...

53:54.640 --> 53:57.080
which is the chemical basis
for the serum.

53:57.240 --> 54:01.920
Any snake that ingests this serum
can grow 100 times its normal size.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.360
- And you were chasing it?
- Destroying the flowers and research...

54:07.520 --> 54:10.560
is the only way I could atone
for what I did.

54:10.760 --> 54:12.160
I've been waiting every day...

54:12.320 --> 54:15.320
for any sign that would lead me
to these orchids.

54:15.480 --> 54:17.640
And this is where they were?

54:18.080 --> 54:19.760
I started hearing strange stories...

54:19.920 --> 54:23.960
about these animals and people
that were disappearing in these hills.

54:24.120 --> 54:26.720
Didn't take a genius to figure it out.

54:26.880 --> 54:29.360
Why try it by yourself?

54:30.080 --> 54:31.920
No one believed me.

54:33.680 --> 54:37.320
I had this cop, Vasile, with me,
but he's dead.

54:41.040 --> 54:43.760
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.760
Find anything?

55:41.360 --> 55:42.400
No.

55:43.560 --> 55:46.840
I think he hid it in the mineshaft,
which is about a half a mile north.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.160
You guys wanna chance it?

55:48.320 --> 55:52.240
Snakes are nocturnal. They detect heat.
It's pretty dark out there.

55:55.720 --> 55:57.680
Unless you're feeling lucky.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.640
We'll wait here till sunup.

56:01.840 --> 56:04.960
Good. Then we'll keep looking.

56:05.120 --> 56:07.280
What exactly are we looking for?

56:08.120 --> 56:11.080
Anything that references the serum.

56:47.960 --> 56:49.120
Hey.

56:51.360 --> 56:53.760
Honey, you need to eat something.

56:56.600 --> 56:59.280
Heather, look at me. Look at me.

57:01.120 --> 57:03.960
If we get the chance,
we're getting out of here.

57:04.120 --> 57:07.840
And I need you to have your strength
because I can't do this by myself.

57:08.280 --> 57:10.600
And I'm not leaving you here.

57:11.360 --> 57:13.360
You hear me? I won't leave you here.

57:21.040 --> 57:22.480
I'm not leaving you.

57:44.240 --> 57:47.680
- Anything?
- No, it's all boring.

57:51.480 --> 57:53.360
I just rigged an explosive
to the window.

57:54.280 --> 57:57.440
Nothing gets out, nothing gets in.

58:01.040 --> 58:03.600
We're not gonna be able
to stall these guys much longer.

58:03.760 --> 58:06.040
We better have a plan before sunup.

58:09.160 --> 58:10.960
Loose floorboards.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.720
Is this what you're looking for?

58:17.920 --> 58:21.480
- Is there any more down there?
- No, that's it. Nothing else.

58:21.920 --> 58:25.240
He's gotta have the chemical
composition written down somewhere.

58:25.920 --> 58:28.400
You know,
if that thing's attracted to flowers...

58:28.560 --> 58:30.360
it's gonna love this.

58:34.360 --> 58:36.680
You know, they find this...

58:36.840 --> 58:38.080
they'll kill us both.

58:38.240 --> 58:39.800
Exactly.

58:39.960 --> 58:43.120
And that's the serum
that causes cell regeneration.

58:45.840 --> 58:48.000
What does that mean?

58:51.840 --> 58:53.680
So we can't kill it.

58:53.840 --> 58:56.800
Not if you're talking about shooting it
or cutting its head off.

58:56.960 --> 58:58.480
It's too big.

59:01.520 --> 59:05.520
But if there's enough damage
to the internal organs, maybe.

59:06.400 --> 59:08.320
Maybe...?

59:09.360 --> 59:13.400
The snake's organs are long and thin
because of its tubular shape, right?

59:13.600 --> 59:17.800
If we destroy enough of them,
there's no way it can heal.

59:19.640 --> 59:22.280
Either that or burying it alive.

59:22.440 --> 59:25.040
Hey, I didn't say
this was gonna be easy.

59:26.120 --> 59:30.960
It just doesn't make sense
that this would be all of the serum.

59:36.680 --> 59:38.240
Murdoch.

59:40.080 --> 59:41.760
He didn't want Murdoch getting it...

59:41.920 --> 59:44.280
so he would hide the bulk of it
someplace else.

59:44.440 --> 59:45.520
Who's Murdoch?

59:46.440 --> 59:49.200
Murdoch's the one
who financed this nightmare.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.120
- I'm gonna put this away just in case.
- We should get some sleep.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.000
Hey, what's going on?

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.280
At least somebody's having fun.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.200
I'm sorry.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.320
It's okay.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.760
How good is his smell?

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.360
Not that great,
but this stuff is pure concentrate.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.320
I'm stepping out.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.480
Come here, quick.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.480
Ready?

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.320
So, what's the plan?

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.360
You know what, kid?
I don't have a plan.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.800
I guess just be ready to move
when I do.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.000
And if I'm not here...

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.880
you bring her with you, okay?

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.280
Okay.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.680
You know,
if that thing's attracted to flowers...

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.320
it's gonna love this.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.880
- Amanda, what's the plan?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.840
- Amanda, what's the plan?
- I'm thinking!

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.200
- What do you want me to do, huh?
- Don't take it out on me, all right?

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.320
I just lost three of my friends!

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.720
This is... Look. It's the serum.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.000
He must have kept it in here
to keep it cool.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.000
Great. Now we've found it.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.040
All we gotta do
is get back to the camp.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.680
Hey.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.880
I'm sorry.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.160
Come on.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.440
- I don't even know where we're going.
- Well, just...

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.880
What do we got to lose, huh?

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.320
- This way?
- Yeah.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.280
How many friends have you lost?

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.600
I can't really talk about that right now.
It's not my mission.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800
- This way.
- You sure?

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.120
- Yeah.
- Amanda!

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.400
We have the serum. We actually...
We found it.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.080
Take it, take it.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.000
- Look, what's the problem?
- There's been a change in plans.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.200
- I'll be going alone.
- Give him the bag.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.880
Amanda, hand me the bag.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.320
- Amanda, give him the bag.
- Shut your mouth.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.040
- You, hey, back off.
- We have what your boss asked for.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.800
- We found what your boss wants.
- Give him the bag. Give him the bag.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.160
- Back off.
- We found it in the...

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.720
- Hand me the bag now.
- Amanda, give him the bag!

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.360
Run!

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.960
Go.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.920
- Come on.
- Go.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.800
- What are you doing?
- Go, run.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.920
- What are you doing? No!
- Run. Get out.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.840
- Come with me.
- Go! Run, go.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.120
Glad to see you, sir.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.400
Eugene.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.400
You, back inside.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.000
I need water for the girl.
She's having convulsions.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.680
It's fine, I'll watch him.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.840
- How was the drive, sir?
- Terrible.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.640
- Is there anything I should know about?
- No, sir, everything is good.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.440
Good.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.480
Vasile?

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.720
What are you doing here?
I told you to take care of the girl.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.600
We got split up.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.880
That snake of yours almost killed me.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.279
But he didn't.

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:24.080
Now you're just another loose end.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.240
I had a feeling
that's what you would do.

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:30.600
So I cut a new deal...

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.920
with someone
who will pay twice what you pay.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:40.200
Eugene, this is what I pay you for.
Time to start cleaning house.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.080
Actually...

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.840
I'm the new partner
he was telling you about.

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.120
- But we had a deal.
- I'm deeply sorry, Murdoch.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.120
- A very good deal.
- Shoot him.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.319
Shoot him.

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:07.240
Go ahead.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:09.080
What are you waiting for? Shoot him.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.359
Come on, let's get you out of here.
We gotta go, come on.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.319
Get her to the car.
Get her to the Jeep. Go, go, go.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:49.800
Move, move, move. Go.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.840
Are you okay?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.520
- No, I don't think so.
- Okay, come with me.

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.440
They're coming.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.280
- We gotta get out of here. Come on.
- Not so fast, Amanda.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.560
Murdoch.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.240
If I wanted to kill you,
you would already be dead.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.640
Now, this is a fully automatic weapon.
Are you prepared to take the risk?

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.360
Yeah, try me.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.080
Give me what I came for.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.480
There's no time for this.
The snakes are alive.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.720
Snakes?

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.200
Peter created a snake
that would regenerate.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.040
- Then the serum works.
- The threat has doubled.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.320
Oh, that's disturbing,
but not of immediate concern.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.960
Hey.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.680
I'll give you a deal.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.280
Your lives for the serum.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.160
I am a man of my word.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.840
Yeah.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.120
Come on.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.800
Just give it to him. Give it to him.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.040
All right. Take your bloody serum.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.840
You saved my life.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.720
You can have yours. Now go.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.800
Go.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.120
Go on, get out.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.480
Go.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.640
It's coming, come on.
Come on, hurry.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:42.520
It works! It works!

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.040
If I'm not back in five minutes,
I'm not coming back.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.840
Made it.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.880
You can rot in hell.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.520
Come on, we gotta go.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.800
- Jackson, come here.
- Yeah, here, here, here.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:28.040
- Here, take the keys. You drive.
- Okay.

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.560
- Oh, my God, what is that?
- It's the anaconda.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.720
Let's go, hurry.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.080
Drive, go.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.600
Go, go, go.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:03.640
Here, get rid of this.
Throw it out the window.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.680
- Down!
- Get down, down, down!

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.120
Amanda. Amanda, are you okay?
Heather, stay down. Down.

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.680
Alex, take the wheel!

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.000
Alex, take the damn wheel!

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.240
Take it.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.320
Okay, come on.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.040
I got it.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.880
Jackson!

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.920
Keep your eyes on the road.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.640
- Jackson.
- No.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.880
Hurry.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.600
- Hurry, Jackson.
- I'm trying.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.560
Let's see you try and regenerate
from that.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.640
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go.
