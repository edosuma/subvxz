Grover, what do you mean coming in here
after me when I'm with my friends?

01:01.311 --> 01:05.465
Get outta here. You'll get your supplies
tomorrow like everybody else.

01:05.565 --> 01:09.636
- It ain't that. I brought you something.
- Yeah? What?

01:09.736 --> 01:12.722
A piece of tail,
cos I owe you a favour, you dig?

01:12.822 --> 01:17.018
A piece of what? Man,
what you talking about? Look over there.

01:17.118 --> 01:22.190
I got plenty of tail. I got more tail
than I can handle. I even got white tail.

01:22.290 --> 01:26.236
And you telling me you brought me
something. What you been shootin'?

01:26.336 --> 01:30.198
It ain't that. This is something special.
This broad is strung out.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.743
Says she'll do anything
to get straight, man. Anything.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.121
Then she's yours. You fix her.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.415
Come on, man. Don't be like that.

01:38.515 --> 01:44.045
If I say she's somethin' special,
she's somethin' special, man.

01:44.145 --> 01:47.382
At least you can look at her.
She's sittin' in your car.

01:47.482 --> 01:52.721
In my car? You mean you've got
some strung-out broad in my car?

01:52.821 --> 01:55.589
Man, I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.596
All right, baby. Everybody out.

02:09.002 --> 02:12.782
- You say she'll do anything?
- That's what she said, man.

02:12.882 --> 02:16.161
Ain't she somethin'? Too much for me.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.779
Get in. You drive.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.005
Honey, you're with friends at last.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.716
We're gonna straighten you out for sure.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.844
You know just the words that turn me on.

02:32.944 --> 02:36.097
And I know what you want, too,
and you're gonna get it.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.808
Let's go to your place.
You can have the leftovers.

02:38.908 --> 02:41.301
No, man, I just wanna
get high and watch.

02:50.628 --> 02:54.032
Hey, ain't one man
big enough for you, honey?

02:54.132 --> 02:58.578
Do I look like the kind of girl
one man would be enough for?

02:58.678 --> 03:03.458
- One big man.
- One big dealin' man, maybe.

03:03.558 --> 03:07.212
You are that big dealin' man
I been hearin' about, ain't you?

03:07.312 --> 03:09.830
Yeah, maybe. Big enough.

03:14.485 --> 03:20.215
- When you gonna give me some?
- In a little bit. We're almost there.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.896
Anything you want, big man.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.107
Jesus.

Yeah.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.985
Wait.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.708
You better give it to me first.

05:50.808 --> 05:55.255
Dammit, what the hell are you doing
in there? Making a goddamn soufflé?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.632
Just a minute, Sugarman.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.459
First things first, you dig?

06:04.238 --> 06:08.300
Hey, big man.
Why don't you turn out the lights?

06:19.504 --> 06:24.191
This is the end of your rotten life,
you motherfuckin' dope pusher.

06:38.773 --> 06:42.927
It was easy for him because
he really didn't believe it was comin'.

06:43.027 --> 06:46.848
But it ain't gonna be easy for you.
You better believe it's comin'.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.808
Wait. Wait.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.395
What do you wanna go
and do this for? Why?

06:52.495 --> 06:55.398
Look here. I got your fix.
Don't you want your fix?

06:55.498 --> 06:58.058
No. But you do.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.530
I don't get this.
What do you want with me?

07:02.630 --> 07:06.659
My name's Coffin.
LuBelle Coffin is my little sister.

07:06.759 --> 07:07.535
LuBelle?

07:07.635 --> 07:11.205
Shootin' smack at 11,
and you got her on it!

07:11.305 --> 07:13.499
Please! Please!

07:13.599 --> 07:17.337
Her whole life is gone.
She can never get it back.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.590
And you're livin' real good.
That ain't right.

07:20.690 --> 07:25.386
- It ain't right, so go on and take the shot.
- I can't. That'd kill me.

07:25.486 --> 07:30.183
Maybe it will, maybe it won't. But if it do,
you're gonna fly through the Pearly Gates

07:30.283 --> 07:33.603
with the biggest fuckin' smile
St Peter's ever seen.

07:33.703 --> 07:37.681
I don't even remember
your little sister. No!

07:43.212 --> 07:46.074
- NURSE: I can't do it, Doctor.
- Christ, now what?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.242
It's her first time in emergency.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.953
Get somebody in here
who can handle this job.

07:51.053 --> 07:55.083
Where's Coffin? Get Coffin in here.

07:55.183 --> 07:59.128
- Sorry I'm late, Doctor.
- Where the hell have you been?

07:59.228 --> 08:05.176
Car broke down on the freeway. Just
shook me up a little bit. I'll be all right.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.553
Jesus, what's happening here tonight?

08:07.653 --> 08:10.473
This place is turning
into a fuckin' insane asylum.

08:10.573 --> 08:16.020
Coffy, get your ass outta here, and don't
come back until you're good and ready.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.888
- Now move!
- Yes, Doctor.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.767
All right, let's go.
We don't have all day.

08:27.507 --> 08:31.452
Hi, Doctor.
Another fun-filled Saturday night.

08:31.552 --> 08:35.581
- What can I do for you, McHenry?
- This is my new partner, Carter Brown.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.583
- Carter, Dr Brannan.
- How are you, Doctor?

08:38.683 --> 08:40.294
Hello, young man.

08:40.394 --> 08:45.091
Sergeant said you want information on
that junkie OD case we turned up tonight.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.637
Right. Come over to the desk for a minute.
I don't think he's gonna come out of it,

08:49.737 --> 08:54.725
because he apparently shot something
else besides heroin. Clipboard, please.

08:54.825 --> 08:58.312
I'd like to know if you found
any other drugs around the scene.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.816
I'd like to know what to treat him for
until we get the analysis.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.111
MCHENRY: No, sorry.
He'll have flushed it down the toilet.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.655
BROWN: Hey, Coffy.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.856
Hey, baby.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.493
Carter.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.371
What's the matter? Somethin' wrong?

09:15.471 --> 09:19.375
No, I'm just a little tired tonight
for some reason.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.586
What are you doin' here?

09:21.686 --> 09:26.716
The only cop I know to get a dislocated
toe, run over by his own squad car,

09:26.816 --> 09:29.719
while writing a ticket
cos he didn't set the handbrake.

09:29.819 --> 09:35.975
- Come on. Don't tell stories like that.
- I had to hold your hand while they set it.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.718
- You want some?
- Yeah, black, please.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.565
Boy, we had a real messy one tonight.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.693
A junkie killed his connection
with a shotgun.

09:45.793 --> 09:49.989
Blew his head clean off,
then OD'd himself.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.451
Yeah? Kind of strange, isn't it?

09:53.551 --> 09:57.038
At least, that's what my partner says.
I don't believe it.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.289
You don't?

09:58.389 --> 10:02.001
There's a mob been takin' over
the vice and narcotics rackets.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.212
Even tryin' to pay off the police.

10:04.312 --> 10:08.216
You're really beginning to sound
like a cop now, you know it?

10:08.316 --> 10:11.594
I got a busy night, Carter. I gotta go.

10:11.694 --> 10:15.765
Wait a minute. I still wanna see you.
Can't we get together this week?

10:15.865 --> 10:20.394
Come on, Carter. I've told you how it is.
Things haven't changed any.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.773
I can't believe you're still hung up
on that phoney politician.

10:23.873 --> 10:28.069
You're not gonna get to me
by insulting my friends.

10:28.169 --> 10:33.324
Just give it a chance. Somethin' innocent,
like a movie or a drive in the country.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.952
What are you doin' tomorrow?

10:36.052 --> 10:38.538
You won't wanna do
what I'm doin' tomorrow.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.282
Yes, I will. Try me.

10:55.237 --> 10:58.808
Some of the kids
were on all kinds of pills.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.686
Some are on methadone now.

11:01.786 --> 11:05.648
The youngest is only nine years old.

11:05.748 --> 11:09.193
The worst are the ones
that got the contaminated junk.

11:09.293 --> 11:14.448
But you know dealin' junkies. They'll put
anything into it to stretch a dollar out of it.

11:14.548 --> 11:20.454
Time to sit up again, LuBelle.
Your sister's come to see you again.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.655
Flower-child.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.504
Hello, LuBelle. Remember me?

11:28.604 --> 11:31.122
Do you remember Carter?

11:33.192 --> 11:36.336
I brought you your favourite candy.

11:38.781 --> 11:42.518
How do you feel today?
Do you feel better? Good.

11:42.618 --> 11:46.554
You look a lot better.
Who combed your hair?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.736
When I got my certificate
I moved up here

11:51.836 --> 11:54.822
so I could make more bread
to send some home to LuBelle,

11:54.922 --> 11:57.700
paying for music lessons
and dance classes,

11:57.800 --> 12:00.620
so she wouldn't end up hustlin'
like my older sister.

12:00.720 --> 12:07.460
But when you got a sister hustlin' and
a brother snortin' coke and shootin' up...

12:07.560 --> 12:09.879
Then I found out about a month ago,

12:09.979 --> 12:15.092
for the past year
all the money's been goin' for junk.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.803
Pills first, then smack.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.681
I told her to stay away
from those people.

12:20.781 --> 12:27.095
But some junkie knew she was gettin'
money and he started leanin' on her.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.473
Carter...

12:31.375 --> 12:37.365
Wouldn't you wanna kill somebody who'd
done a thing like that to your little sister?

12:37.465 --> 12:40.534
- I sure would.
- Then you think it'd be right?

12:40.634 --> 12:47.166
What? To kill some pusher who's only
sellin' to get money to buy for himself?

12:47.266 --> 12:50.628
What good would that do, Coffy?
He's only a part of a chain

12:50.728 --> 12:55.591
that reaches all the way back to
some poor farmer in Turkey or Vietnam.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.386
- What would you do? Kill all of 'em?
- Why not?

12:58.486 --> 13:00.971
Nothing else seems to do any good.

13:01.071 --> 13:04.433
You know who they are.
Everybody knows who they are.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.645
You're a cop.
Why don't you just arrest them?

13:07.745 --> 13:11.065
It's not that simple, Coffy.
The law can't do that.

13:11.165 --> 13:14.610
You bet it can't.
And I know why it can't too.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.688
Because the law
is in for a piece of the action.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.535
Not all of us.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.736
Not yet.

13:31.977 --> 13:39.427
Now, look who's here. It's pretty hard
for an ordinary cop to compete with.

13:39.527 --> 13:43.931
Carter, you've been real nice up to now.
Don't spoil it.

13:44.031 --> 13:48.561
But we had a real good thing together
once. I think there's still somethin' there.

13:48.661 --> 13:53.524
But we were kids then.
Things are different now.

13:53.624 --> 13:57.268
- Good night, Carter.
- Good night, Coffy.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.165
- George, you're here early.
- Good evening, Miss Coffin.

14:09.265 --> 14:13.669
Mr Brunswick said he'd be finished with
business early so you can come sooner.

14:13.769 --> 14:19.040
Okay, but give me a few minutes to change.
I'll be right back.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.414
Howard, I think your interest
in this place

14:50.514 --> 14:55.836
goes a little beyond just sticking your
nose into those books once in a while.

14:55.936 --> 15:00.049
Ruben, you know I never
mix business with pleasure.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.260
Except in a ratio of three to one.

15:03.360 --> 15:08.390
When I was a cop on the East Side I had
the same ratio, only the other way around.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.259
I didn't say how I mixed 'em.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.555
Here comes my best business now.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.488
- Thanks, Floyd,
- Yes, sir.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.397
Hello, baby.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.619
Ruben, this is Ms Coffin.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.664
Coffy, this is Ruben Ramos,
our deputy commissioner.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.584
- Commissioner of what?
- Apple stealers, flatfoots.

15:35.684 --> 15:39.171
He's the heat, baby,
so don't pull out any pills or joints.

15:39.271 --> 15:44.593
Really? The fuzz? Isn't there a conflict of
interest with you two being here together?

15:44.693 --> 15:49.974
Not at all. In fact, the city council and the
police have many interests in common.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.226
Careful. There are limits.

15:52.326 --> 15:58.190
Unfortunately. Especially when the
interest is so charming and so beautiful.

15:58.290 --> 16:02.528
Don't try any of that Latin machismo
charm on her. She's a liberated woman.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.656
But not that liberated.
Let the man have his say.

16:05.756 --> 16:09.034
- Hi. Like to have your picture taken?
- Sure. Why not?

16:09.134 --> 16:11.120
- I look awful.
- You look fine.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.988
Here we go.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.491
Wow.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.385
Well, I gotta go
catch me some criminals.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.680
So soon?
You were just getting warmed up.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.433
He's got hippies to beat up.

16:32.533 --> 16:37.187
The day of a public servant is never over.
It has been delightful meeting you.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.056
So long, you lucky dog.

16:47.214 --> 16:51.285
- I'll have to take that, sweetheart.
- Get out of here. What do you want?

16:51.385 --> 16:58.282
Shut up or I'll cut it off. I don't have time
to fuck around. Just give me the film.

17:04.397 --> 17:10.377
You oughta be more careful
where you point that camera, sweetheart.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.266
Baby, what are we doing in this dump?

17:14.366 --> 17:17.685
You like it? I just bought it.

17:17.786 --> 17:23.067
- You bought this place?
- Part of it, along with some other people.

17:23.166 --> 17:27.363
- I guess I can drink to that.
- I got something better you can drink to.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.616
- Remember that surprise I promised you?
- Yeah. What?

17:30.716 --> 17:33.035
Meet Congressman Brunswick.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.246
Congressman? Are you out of your mind?

17:36.346 --> 17:39.625
No. They're gonna run me for Congress.

17:39.725 --> 17:44.328
Really? Then let me congratulate you,
Congressman.

17:45.481 --> 17:49.250
I ain't never screwed
a congressman before.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.057
(MOANS)

17:55.157 --> 17:58.968
When you do that,
it makes me feel so good.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.681
You make me feel so happy.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.403
(BRUNSWICK GROANS)

18:07.503 --> 18:10.698
I love you, baby.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.899
You're my woman.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.780
I'll say I am. All yours.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.492
My man.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.222
What's the matter, Coffy, baby?

18:35.322 --> 18:38.100
Something's been bothering you.

18:38.200 --> 18:43.147
I've just been thinking about
having to go back to work tonight.

18:43.247 --> 18:47.651
That night shift has been
making me a little jumpy.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.863
I thought it was cos
when a man gets to my age,

18:50.963 --> 18:53.949
he can't satisfy
them lusty young bitches no more.

18:54.049 --> 18:57.786
COFFY:
Don't start gettin' insecure, Grandpa.

18:57.886 --> 19:01.790
That long goody'll keep on working
as long as I'm able to handle it,

19:01.890 --> 19:04.334
and you know it too, you old dog, you.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.045
(COUGHS)

19:06.145 --> 19:08.088
Oops! Ah!

19:08.188 --> 19:11.123
You shouldn't have made me laugh.

19:14.945 --> 19:18.932
BRUNSWICK: That just goes to show
I been savin' it all for you.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.801
COFFY: I guess.

19:36.508 --> 19:40.996
You know, baby,
I'm really due for a few days off.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.540
Maybe a week.

19:43.640 --> 19:48.545
We such a such a good time last year
in Hawaii. Could we go back?

19:48.645 --> 19:52.966
I don't think so, baby. I'm gonna
be pretty busy with the campaign.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.969
Then let's go up to the cabin.

19:56.069 --> 19:59.515
- It's really nice in the mountains now.
- Okay, baby. Look.

19:59.615 --> 20:06.846
After the election, win or lose, we'll take
a couple of weeks off and go to Acapulco.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.861
If you put it that way, baby...

21:04.930 --> 21:09.251
- Hey, beautiful. You in trouble?
- No, I'm all right, thank you.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.296
- I wanna help.
- Hands off. Ain't nothin' shakin'.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.673
- Hold it. Police.
- What do you want?

21:14.773 --> 21:17.593
I'll do the questioning.
You got identification?

21:17.693 --> 21:20.252
Hold it. What's in that pocket?

21:21.905 --> 21:24.173
Get up there.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.146
- What you doin' here?
- My old lady's in the hospital.

21:29.246 --> 21:35.309
There's no loitering in this lot.
I want you to move it. Move it, buddy.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.206
Why, thank you, Officer.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.833
At your service, ma'am.

21:49.933 --> 21:52.002
Carter, what are you doin' here?

21:52.102 --> 21:57.049
- Actually, I was lookin' for you.
- Really? Shit.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.800
(SNIFFS)

21:58.900 --> 22:02.888
Coffy, is there something
you wanna talk to somebody about?

22:02.988 --> 22:08.185
Yeah, as a matter of fact. Why don't we go
someplace and find a cup of coffee?

22:08.285 --> 22:10.511
I make the greatest cup
of coffee on earth.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.316
That is good.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.236
I feel better already.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.364
We did have some good times together.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.816
Remember how you used to make me laugh?

22:26.094 --> 22:28.946
When was the last time I laughed?

22:30.932 --> 22:37.339
Carter, have you done something
when you were mad - I mean really mad -

22:37.439 --> 22:39.633
that it was like being in a dream?

22:39.733 --> 22:42.928
Like being up in the ceiling
looking down on somebody?

22:43.028 --> 22:45.806
- I think I know what you mean.
- The past few days...

22:45.906 --> 22:48.007
(PHONE RINGS)

22:55.082 --> 22:56.358
Hello?

22:56.458 --> 22:58.318
Hi, Mac.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.988
I thought about it.
I thought about it a lot.

23:01.088 --> 23:05.492
I gotta tell you somethin'. Not only
am I not in, but if you go along with it,

23:05.592 --> 23:08.829
I'll find a way to bust you
right along with the rest of 'em.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.039
Do you hear me, Mac?

23:11.139 --> 23:16.869
You better be hearin' me good
because that's the way it's gonna be.

23:44.798 --> 23:48.201
Ever get the feelin' you talk too much?

23:48.301 --> 23:51.330
What was that all about?

23:51.430 --> 23:55.241
That was me,
blowin' my piece of the action.

23:56.518 --> 24:00.714
- What do you mean?
- My partner McHenry's on the take.

24:00.814 --> 24:04.968
- Who's paying off?
- A gangster from Vegas named Vitroni.

24:05.068 --> 24:08.638
Movin' into the black rackets
cos the big money now is in narcotics.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.099
Taken over
most pimps and dealers already.

24:11.199 --> 24:13.602
- Pimps?
- Yeah, like King George.

24:13.702 --> 24:16.646
He's a big dealer too.
It all goes together.

24:16.746 --> 24:18.732
I've heard of King George.

24:18.832 --> 24:23.487
So if everybody else is for sale,
why are you so special?

24:23.587 --> 24:26.365
There's plenty of good cops left.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.942
What we need is more support
from the people.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.823
Quick, get in there. Shut the door.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.743
That's him!

24:45.066 --> 24:47.167
Leave him alone!

24:49.529 --> 24:52.298
Stay out of this, bitch.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.311
Let's go.

25:08.924 --> 25:13.611
- What are you doin'? We ain't got time.
- Just a second.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.114
Jesus.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.451
Come on, dammit.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.668
Carter?

25:34.282 --> 25:38.937
COFFY: I'll kill those bastards for this.
I swear I will.

25:39.037 --> 25:42.640
He's not so good, Coffy.
Quite a bit of brain damage.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.781
Down this way.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.342
What are his chances, Doc?

26:09.442 --> 26:12.554
He may be able to go to the bathroom
by himself someday.

26:12.654 --> 26:16.475
- Somebody sure worked him over.
- Yeah.

26:16.575 --> 26:22.680
MCHENRY: Yeah, I'd sure like to get
my hands on the guys that did this.

26:33.049 --> 26:38.079
What's happenin'? Do you know a lady
named Priscilla that lives around here?

26:38.179 --> 26:40.948
Yeah. Back there up the steps.

27:03.371 --> 27:05.139
Priscilla.

27:11.963 --> 27:15.075
- Hello, Priscilla.
- Do I know you from somewhere?

27:15.175 --> 27:18.318
Yeah. I helped sew up your face.
Remember?

27:20.722 --> 27:23.375
Yeah.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.576
The nurse at the hospital.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.668
What do you want with me?

27:38.323 --> 27:42.394
I see you're back on the junk again.

27:42.494 --> 27:46.565
Just a little now and then.
I ain't got a habit any more.

27:46.665 --> 27:50.819
You ain't? You still
street hustling for King George?

27:50.919 --> 27:55.156
No. Listen, my old man
is coming back any minute.

27:55.256 --> 27:57.701
If she catches you,
she'll kick your ass.

27:57.801 --> 28:04.040
Don't get excited. I just wanna ask you
a few questions about King George.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.824
Yeah?

28:07.727 --> 28:09.411
Why?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.009
You wanna get in the life?

28:14.109 --> 28:16.210
Maybe.

28:17.654 --> 28:20.807
I ain't seen him.

28:20.907 --> 28:23.675
Not since I met Harriet.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.024
And anyway...

28:29.124 --> 28:31.850
I never was a street hustler.

28:33.044 --> 28:37.032
I was his top call girl
and his personal old lady.

28:37.132 --> 28:41.536
Until he cut your face.
Then you weren't so popular any more.

28:41.636 --> 28:44.956
Then he put you back on the street.
Ain't that right?

28:45.056 --> 28:50.253
Yeah. That's because I got mad
and I called him a nigger.

28:50.353 --> 28:54.883
- I knew I shouldn't have done that.
- Do you know this fellow Vitroni?

28:54.983 --> 28:58.470
Arturo Vitroni? Sure.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.514
All George's girls know Arturo.

29:01.614 --> 29:04.851
Balling Arturo is like paying
your taxes to the government.

29:04.951 --> 29:08.021
What's he like?

29:08.121 --> 29:12.525
You mean what is he like
or what does he like?

29:12.625 --> 29:14.643
Both.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.480
Well, he's kind of freaky.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.733
Not too bad.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.837
He likes a girl he thinks is foreign.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.038
Exotic, you know?

29:36.775 --> 29:43.264
I mean, you tell him you are the queen
of the giant Kluck-luks from Inner Siberia

29:43.364 --> 29:45.642
and he starts dripping in his pants,

29:45.742 --> 29:49.062
and the only way he's gonna get it off

29:49.162 --> 29:56.027
is to have you crawl around the floor, talk
bad to you, spit on you, things like that.

29:56.127 --> 30:01.449
Where does King George find girls
that'll do that kind of an act?

30:01.549 --> 30:07.580
Through his pushers. They find strung-out
chicks that do anything to get straight.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.583
He has got people all over.

30:10.683 --> 30:13.577
Now, one more thing.

30:14.646 --> 30:18.415
- Where does he keep his supply?
- His sup...

30:19.150 --> 30:22.262
Hey, what are you trying,
to get me killed?

30:22.362 --> 30:26.057
Where does he keep it?
You know, don't you? You lived with him.

30:26.157 --> 30:29.269
You get outta here right now.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.720
Go on. Get outta here.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.473
Get out!

30:38.419 --> 30:43.408
So, you wanna play with knives?
You picked the wrong player.

30:43.508 --> 30:49.289
No. Please, look,
I didn't mean nothin'. Please. Ow!

30:49.389 --> 30:53.376
I'll give you a slice to match the one
you got from that dope-pushin' pimp

30:53.476 --> 30:55.628
unless you say where he keeps the stuff.

30:55.728 --> 30:59.090
No, please. He'll kill me.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.050
All right.

31:01.150 --> 31:05.545
He's got a fireplace.
It's in a box under the ashes.

31:08.241 --> 31:11.603
Harriet! Harriet!

31:11.703 --> 31:13.980
What the hell is going on here?

31:14.080 --> 31:18.058
She busted in here trying to make me.
Get her outta here.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.441
Come on, bitch.

31:38.187 --> 31:40.288
You lousy bitch!

31:43.568 --> 31:46.471
I go away for half an hour
for you to turn a trick,

31:46.571 --> 31:52.718
and I come back and find you ballin'
some nigger bitch. You white tramp!

You're the lady from Jamaica
who called me.

33:06.609 --> 33:11.055
That I am, man, and I can see that
you're not at all disappointed, of course,

33:11.155 --> 33:14.434
so I'll come straight to the point,
as I like to do.

33:14.534 --> 33:17.969
Bus! Another drink for my friend here.

33:19.330 --> 33:22.191
I presume a champagne cocktail
is sufficient?

33:22.291 --> 33:26.613
Good. I assume you've got complete
protection from the police, have you?

33:26.713 --> 33:27.822
Course.

33:27.922 --> 33:31.659
Of course, man. I contacted you
as soon as I arrived from Kingston.

33:31.759 --> 33:35.079
I'm told you are the very best
there is in your business.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.540
Is that right, man?

33:37.640 --> 33:39.834
- I'd say so.
- Good, man.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.961
I don't do no leather work, man.

33:42.061 --> 33:45.965
No whips, ropes, chains,
or none of those fetish freaks.

33:46.065 --> 33:48.927
Just plain sex.

33:49.027 --> 33:54.047
But for that I don't mind saying
that I am the very best in my business.

33:59.620 --> 34:03.983
We'll just have to see
about that, won't we?

34:04.083 --> 34:06.560
Course, man.

34:22.768 --> 34:29.926
These aren't gettin' any better. You're
gonna have to stay off your back awhile.

34:30.025 --> 34:32.127
Oh, well.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.148
Hello, Robert?

34:44.248 --> 34:47.193
Hi. This is Jeri.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.737
I got your number from Lois.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.281
You remember Lois.

34:52.380 --> 34:57.444
Well, I'm new in town and I thought
you might like to meet me?

34:58.513 --> 35:01.781
What do I do? What do you want?

35:04.644 --> 35:05.545
Yes.

35:05.645 --> 35:08.205
I know all about that.

35:09.273 --> 35:14.085
Lois told me and it turned me on.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.130
Hm?

35:19.617 --> 35:25.648
I have long blonde hair,
blue eyes, creamy skin,

35:25.748 --> 35:30.069
and I'm very busty,
I guess you could say.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.572
Hm?

35:32.672 --> 35:34.782
I guess so.

35:34.882 --> 35:36.983
What's your address?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.956
Good grief.

35:42.056 --> 35:44.157
Half-hour?

35:44.809 --> 35:46.284
Mm.

35:47.436 --> 35:49.120
Bye.

35:51.274 --> 35:54.469
Jeri, this is for you.
Better get dressed.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.721
- Shit, Helen.
- Come on.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.965
It's only a blow job in his office.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.885
All right.

36:07.915 --> 36:12.310
I'll be back soon
and take the rest of the night off.

36:19.385 --> 36:22.529
What the hell's goin' on around here?

36:23.639 --> 36:28.795
Looks like a goddamn pyjama party.
I want you to meet somebody.

36:28.895 --> 36:32.580
This here's... Mystique.

36:34.984 --> 36:39.097
COFFY: Quite an assortment
you have here, man. Not too bad, really.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.099
Yeah.

36:41.199 --> 36:45.677
They'll do. Let's go
in the other room so we can talk.

36:54.128 --> 36:58.366
Georgie, sweetie. Here I am. Surprise.

36:58.466 --> 37:01.160
You weren't supposed
to get back until tonight.

37:01.260 --> 37:04.747
I took the morning flight.
Miami was such a drag.

37:04.847 --> 37:07.959
That old fart - he couldn't do anything.
I mean nothing!

37:08.059 --> 37:12.797
A thousand bucks a day
just to show me off to his friends.

37:12.897 --> 37:19.711
So what I need is some real action, honey.
The kind I can only get from my old man.

37:22.531 --> 37:26.760
- Who's this?
- Meg, I want you to meet Mystique.

37:27.954 --> 37:31.107
- Miss Stick? What kind of name is that?
- Jamaican.

37:31.207 --> 37:33.651
She's gonna be a big asset
to our organisation.

37:33.751 --> 37:37.613
Why don't you get yourself
a cup of coffee while I check her out?

37:37.713 --> 37:41.659
What do you mean?
What's there to check out?

37:41.759 --> 37:44.537
It's business. Go in there
and get a cup of coffee.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.364
It's for the big man. The big V.

37:55.481 --> 38:00.094
Someone better turn the fan on.
I think the temperature's rising.

38:00.194 --> 38:02.962
Cindy, love, this one's for you.

38:05.366 --> 38:08.510
No. Not the fat man again.

39:14.727 --> 39:20.039
- I want you to meet Mystique.
- Glad to know you. How are you?

39:24.904 --> 39:28.673
- Good evening, Mr Vitroni.
- Hello, Studs.

39:37.958 --> 39:40.727
Don't look so hostile, Studs.

39:41.962 --> 39:44.907
We're all on the same side now.

39:45.007 --> 39:47.827
You're working for us.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.371
I work for the King.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.572
That's all.

39:53.766 --> 39:56.534
Studs, you need a manicure.

39:59.105 --> 40:01.915
You need a shine.

40:03.275 --> 40:06.669
GEORGE:
I tell you, you will not be sorry.

40:08.531 --> 40:11.517
How d'you do? My name is Vitroni.

40:11.617 --> 40:14.562
COFFY: Yes, Mr Vitroni.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.763
VITRONI: You're Mystique.

40:17.748 --> 40:23.186
Sam. I think Mr Vitroni'd like
another drink. Come along.

40:30.219 --> 40:33.655
Why, Mr Vitroni, you don't have a drink.

40:37.226 --> 40:39.994
I'm so sorry, Miss Stick.

40:44.066 --> 40:46.260
Here, let me help you.

40:46.360 --> 40:49.680
My goodness, you really are a mess.

40:49.780 --> 40:53.476
It was just an accident.
Accidents will happen.

40:53.576 --> 40:58.064
- You are a very naughty girl.
- It was an accident.

40:58.164 --> 41:00.306
- It was not an accident.
- Yes, it was.

41:10.593 --> 41:13.820
It was an accident, like she said.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.502
Now, Mr King Dope-Pusher,

42:01.602 --> 42:05.381
you're gonna have
a few irate customers pretty soon.

42:05.481 --> 42:08.249
Sugar instead of smack.

42:54.947 --> 42:58.633
Meg. You don't have any salad.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.524
Look!

43:29.732 --> 43:33.126
- Let them go.
- They're out of their goddamn minds.

43:56.842 --> 43:59.318
They're so violent.

44:11.023 --> 44:13.332
COFFY: I'll kill you.

44:23.535 --> 44:26.971
VITRONI: Look at that. Watch her go!

44:39.551 --> 44:42.570
Mr Vitroni, I gotta talk to you.

45:00.030 --> 45:02.182
She's a wild animal.

45:02.282 --> 45:05.760
I've got to have
that girl, George. Tonight.

45:06.537 --> 45:09.972

Come. Let's get acquainted.

48:29.907 --> 48:34.144
I'm told that you are
a dangerous man, Arturo.

48:34.244 --> 48:36.345
I like that.

48:37.372 --> 48:39.473
It excites me.

48:43.462 --> 48:48.065
And I can see that I'm having
a good effect on you also.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.321
My love.

48:55.182 --> 49:00.295
Are you sure you're not
just a little black, Arturo?

49:00.395 --> 49:02.496
You're amazing.

49:05.609 --> 49:09.680
Let's go into the other room.
We'll be more comfortable.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.881
Yes. Let's go.

49:49.027 --> 49:54.131
Get down on the floor where you belong,
you no-good, dirty, nigger bitch.

50:00.330 --> 50:04.642
Please. I know I'm not
good enough for you.

50:06.086 --> 50:10.147
But let me have
your precious white body just once.

50:18.056 --> 50:22.576
Then let me see you crawl
over here, you black trash.

50:23.979 --> 50:28.258
I'm not going to hurt you.
Come on. Crawl over here.

50:28.358 --> 50:30.835
Crawl, nigger.

50:35.699 --> 50:39.770
You want me to crawl,
white motherfucker?

50:39.870 --> 50:42.272
What are you doin'? Put that down.

50:42.372 --> 50:46.109
You wanna spit on me and make me crawl?

50:46.209 --> 50:49.562
I'm gonna piss on your grave tomorrow.

50:53.967 --> 50:57.496
Hold it. Don't mess her up.
I don't want any marks on her body.

50:57.596 --> 50:59.498
Look at this.

50:59.598 --> 51:03.543
This is no Saturday-night special.
This is professional equipment.

51:03.643 --> 51:07.923
- Probably got it from her cop boyfriend.
- You were right, Jake. Good work.

51:08.023 --> 51:11.385
I recognised her when she swung
that bottle on that broad's head.

51:11.485 --> 51:14.805
- I don't forget nothin' like that.
- Get Aleva up here now.

51:14.905 --> 51:19.351
- I wanna find out what this is all about.
- George sent her to hit you. What else?

51:19.451 --> 51:23.605
Yeah. I never did have trust
for that pimp. None of them niggers.

51:23.705 --> 51:26.817
Nah, he'd never be so foolish.

51:26.917 --> 51:30.561
This is somebody bigger
than King George.

51:31.338 --> 51:34.899
How 'bout it, chocolate?
Who set this up?

51:36.718 --> 51:38.787
Spit it out.

51:38.887 --> 51:41.665
He asked you a question.

51:41.765 --> 51:44.283
It was King George.

51:45.894 --> 51:50.998
He set it up. He's been workin'
with the brothers all along.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.725
Hit him.

51:59.825 --> 52:03.427
And hit him so that everybody else
will get the idea.

52:14.965 --> 52:17.566
- Is this her?
- Yeah.

52:24.641 --> 52:26.742
You know her?

52:27.519 --> 52:32.623
Mr Vitroni, you got big trouble. Bigger
trouble than you ever could imagine.

52:34.317 --> 52:37.878
George, you gonna stay mad
at me for ever?

52:45.495 --> 52:48.264
I hurt, George. I feel awful.

52:51.751 --> 52:54.687
You could at least talk to me.

52:57.757 --> 53:01.453
Who's that for so early in the morning?

53:01.553 --> 53:03.696
Some dude.

53:08.560 --> 53:12.621
George, are you thinkin'
about turnin' me out?

53:15.567 --> 53:17.668
No, baby. No.

53:22.324 --> 53:26.269
I just got so mad at the way you were
treating that phoney black chick.

53:26.369 --> 53:28.679
Yeah, I know.

53:29.539 --> 53:35.070
I don't see why you have to go to all that
trouble for that pervert gangster, anyway.

53:35.170 --> 53:37.938
I'm just doing him a favour.

53:41.426 --> 53:44.611
Most people appreciate favours.

53:48.516 --> 53:52.578
They never forget you
when you do them a favour.

53:57.400 --> 54:01.847
There's somethin' funny about that chick.
Somethin' just not right.

54:01.947 --> 54:04.099
That so?

54:04.199 --> 54:06.300
- George?
- What?

54:08.203 --> 54:11.815
- Please don't go.
- Baby, I gotta go out.

54:11.915 --> 54:16.903
One of Vitroni's boys called with a buyer
who wants to score right away.

54:17.003 --> 54:20.105
I'll be back.

54:23.635 --> 54:26.413
Let me take care of you.
I really feel like it now.

54:26.513 --> 54:28.614
No, baby, not now.

54:30.392 --> 54:34.129
Baby, you still love me, don't you?

54:34.229 --> 54:38.592
Yeah. I still love you, baby,
you know that. You're my lady.

54:38.692 --> 54:44.546
Look, how long will it be before
you'll be able to take a trick again?

54:45.740 --> 54:48.675
About a week or so. Is that okay, baby?

54:51.538 --> 54:54.390
Yeah. That's fine. Look.

54:55.625 --> 54:59.186
You can take care of me
when I get back, okay?

55:00.964 --> 55:03.732
Okay. I'll be waitin', lover.

55:12.642 --> 55:15.577
Hello, King. Hop in. Let's talk.

55:19.065 --> 55:22.626
I'm sorry, man.
I can't argue with no.45.

55:25.613 --> 55:27.965
Get rolling, Studs.

55:35.332 --> 55:40.487
Okay, come on, you guys.
What's this shit? What's the gag?

55:40.587 --> 55:45.065
- It's going to be very funny.
- I'll take this, King.

55:45.884 --> 55:47.994
I know. I know.

55:48.094 --> 55:53.208
The big man's got a bonus for me
for that cool little trick I sent him, right?

55:53.308 --> 55:55.409
That's right, King.

55:57.562 --> 56:01.841
Jesus. You guys had me
goin' there for a minute.

56:01.941 --> 56:05.294
Hey, Studs! Look at him. Look at Studs.

56:06.738 --> 56:09.548
Look at him. Hey, Studs.

56:12.494 --> 56:16.940
Studs, baby, it's okay.
It's all right, Studs.

56:17.040 --> 56:22.112
Hey, baby, they're just jivin'.
They're just puttin' you on.

56:22.212 --> 56:25.198
- Big V was tickled almost to death.
- Really?

56:25.298 --> 56:28.910
He said he'd never had
nothin' like that before. Ever.

56:29.010 --> 56:32.029
That's good. That's really great.

56:38.853 --> 56:40.329
Hey.

56:43.274 --> 56:45.584
Where we goin'?

56:46.778 --> 56:49.097
That's the surprise.

56:49.197 --> 56:52.049
We don't want to spoil it for you.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.435
Hey.

57:04.254 --> 57:09.409
Man, could I have my Kodak back?
I got a man who needs that today.

57:09.509 --> 57:14.748
No, he don't, King. You quit your worryin'.
It's all gonna be over real soon.

57:14.848 --> 57:17.584
Yeah, sure.

57:17.684 --> 57:21.119
Studs, you stop here. This is okay.

57:27.110 --> 57:31.097
Wait a minute. There's something
you dudes ain't tellin' me.

57:31.197 --> 57:33.183
- Out, King.
- No, man.

57:33.283 --> 57:35.643
- Out!
- I am not gettin' outta this car.

57:35.743 --> 57:38.271
Will somebody please talk to me?

57:38.371 --> 57:42.683
Wait a minute! Somebody please tell me,
man, what have I done?

57:45.545 --> 57:50.241
It's a beautiful suit, King.
You remember I had a surprise for you?

57:50.341 --> 57:53.661
A new necktie. Special woven.

57:53.761 --> 57:55.955
14 nubile maidens.

57:56.055 --> 57:59.751
Come on. Cut out the jokin'. Come on.

57:59.851 --> 58:04.172
I can take a joke as good as anybody,
man, but this has gone too damn far.

58:04.272 --> 58:07.217
Man, tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?

58:07.317 --> 58:10.595
I don't even know what I did.
Come on, now. Studs.

58:10.695 --> 58:15.924
Studs, don't just sit there.
Do somethin'. Studs! Studs!

58:17.785 --> 58:21.272
This is the way we lynch niggers.

58:21.372 --> 58:24.484
Stop the car!
Guys, I'll do anything you want!

58:24.584 --> 58:28.321
What did I do wrong? Jesus! Look out!

58:28.421 --> 58:31.366
God, please! Stop the car!
What did I do?

58:31.466 --> 58:34.744
Somebody tell... Jesus Christ!

58:34.844 --> 58:38.322
You guys, stop the car!
Please! What did I do?

58:41.184 --> 58:44.286
You wanna go fast, Studs?

58:54.489 --> 58:56.173
(LAUGHS)

59:38.491 --> 59:42.260
Studs, that could be you
if you like to talk.

59:43.454 --> 59:47.942
I know, I know.
My mama didn't raise no fool.

59:48.042 --> 59:51.779
Studs, you're a good boy.
You're going to need a job soon.

59:51.879 --> 59:54.398
Come to us.
You'll find out we're not bad people.

59:54.716 --> 59:57.827
This vicious combination
of big business and government

59:57.927 --> 01:00:01.873
has kept our sisters prostitute
and our brothers dope peddlers.

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:04.584
I was talking
to a young man at the clinic.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:08.338
He had so many needle marks
he couldn't find a place for another spike.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:13.218
He had to make at least one burglary each
night to support his $100-a-day habit.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.262
I asked him
"Why would anyone start smacking up

01:00:16.362 --> 01:00:19.015
when they know
what the result is gonna be?"

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:24.646
He said "I'd rather be a junkie than
be nothing." You see what this tells us?

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:29.067
Our power structure has given this man
no reasonable alternative.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:33.571
You ask "Why would a power structure
deliberately create narcotics addicts?"

01:00:33.671 --> 01:00:38.535
I ask you, where do you think
that $100 a day goes?

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.871
Part of it goes to the black
pushers and distributors,

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.624
but the main part of it,
the really big part,

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:47.502
goes to those white men
who import the narcotics.

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:51.839
The big part goes to those white men who
corrupt our law-enforcement agencies.

01:00:51.939 --> 01:00:54.384
And the big part goes to those white men

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:57.679
who draft our black boys
and send them over to Indochina

01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:02.433
to protect other white men who were
the original suppliers of the narcotics.

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:06.980
It becomes a vicious attempt
on the part of the white power structure

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.608
to exploit our black men
and women in this society.

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:11.818
Right.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:16.698
Cut. That was good. We'll use the first part
of that one and the ending of the last take.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:20.150
Nice going, Howard. Real convincing.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:42.214
(BANGING)

01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:51.264
Hey, out there. Is anybody there?

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.901
(BANGING)

01:01:54.001 --> 01:01:59.105
- Can I have somethin' to eat?
- Goddamn son of a bitch woman.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:03.870
Shut up, bitch! Want me
to give you another clout?

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.749
Can I have a glass of water?
Are you tryin' to starve me to death?

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:11.993
Never mind. Just keep quiet.
You won't need no water or nothin'.

01:03:28.554 --> 01:03:30.748
Hello, Councilman.

01:03:30.848 --> 01:03:33.251
Hello, McHenry.
Who else is here? Your boss?

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:35.712
Yeah. This is strictly summit stuff.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:39.674
Personally, I don't know what it's all about
and I don't wanna know.

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:42.542
You're a smart cop, Sergeant.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:09.319
Mr Congressman Brunswick.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:14.292
They tell me you kissed off
your campaign today. How did it go?

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:16.335
- Very well.
- Yes?

01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:19.871
Well, we're all behind you, all the way.

01:04:20.898 --> 01:04:24.093
You should keep your boys away
from where I'm appearing.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:28.389
People keep turning up in photos.
Somebody'll start making comparisons.

01:04:28.489 --> 01:04:31.100
I never appear in photographs.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.729
True. Aleva is very careful about that.

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:38.441
Okay. What did you get me
out here for, anyway?

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:42.278
I thought we'd agreed on everything.
I'm taking a chance being here.

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:46.199
It's dangerous for me too, Howard,
but this is important.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:49.243
Some very strange things
have been happening.

01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:51.412
There's something I don't know about.

01:04:51.512 --> 01:04:54.197
Perhaps, Councilman. Perhaps.

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:57.200
(RATTLING AT DOOR)

01:05:01.105 --> 01:05:03.674
Hey, darky.

01:05:03.774 --> 01:05:06.928
You ain't gonna try to hit me
with one of them rocks?

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:11.516
I'm so weak from hunger I couldn't even
kick sand in your face, motherfucker.

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:13.684
(LAUGHS)

01:05:13.784 --> 01:05:17.396
There's a friend of yours inside
wants to see you.

01:05:17.496 --> 01:05:19.597
Come on.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.561
Come on, come on.

01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:42.046
Gotta hand it to you.
You were a hundred per cent right.

01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:45.591
He knows her all right.
He introduced her to me one night.

01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:47.885
Sure I know her.

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:52.098
She's just some broad I fuck.
What's she doin' here?

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:55.341
This broad you fuck tried to kill me.

01:05:57.244 --> 01:05:59.313
That's what she's doing here.

01:05:59.413 --> 01:06:01.347
What?

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:11.483
That's right. Don't look at him.

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:18.573
Young lady, I want you to understand we
have no personal thing against you at all.

01:06:19.433 --> 01:06:22.587
I know that you were
only following orders,

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:27.758
so there is no reason
why we cannot be friends, is there?

01:06:27.858 --> 01:06:31.429
I'm not a bad man, like I told you.

01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:35.224
I don't want to see
a pretty young girl go to waste,

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:37.977
with your whole life ahead of you.

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:44.015
Just tell me the truth and you can go free,
and no harm will come to you.

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:52.440
Look, do you understand what it means
when a man swears by his mother?

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.278
I swear by my mother.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:01.125
Now, just tell me.

01:07:01.225 --> 01:07:04.295
Did this man send you to kill me?

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:08.591
No. He didn't know nothin'.
Only King George, like I told you.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:11.344
She's his girl.
What do you expect her to say?

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:16.933
Howard, I'm sure, personally,
that you had nothing to do with this.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:21.312
But this is a very serious matter.
We've got a very profitable relationship.

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:25.691
But it depends entirely
on mutual trust and confidence.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:29.737
That's right. We've gone
a long way with you, Brunswick.

01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:32.740
But if we have to,
we'll find another congressman.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.493
- Howard!
- Shut up!

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:37.694
You did your talking.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:42.875
Why would I want
to have you killed, Vitroni?

01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:45.336
I like to steal as much as you do.

01:07:45.436 --> 01:07:47.505
I can answer that, Mr Vitroni.

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:51.300
These people all stick together
like brothers. You can't trust 'em.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.137
Those two pushers that got killed
last month had just come in with us.

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:57.348
Then King George double-crossing us.

01:07:57.448 --> 01:08:00.184
All brothers, remember?
And he's one of them.

01:08:00.284 --> 01:08:05.513
And money or deals or anything
don't make him one of us. Shit.

01:08:11.545 --> 01:08:15.857
You've been listening
to my political speeches.

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:21.413
I thought you'd be more intelligent
than to listen to that crap.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:25.167
For Christ's sake, black, brown or yellow,
I'm in it for the green.

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.368
The green buck.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:30.673
As far as that chick
over there's concerned,

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:34.042
I'll tell you how much she means to me.

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:37.337
VITRONI: Yeah?

01:08:38.154 --> 01:08:39.923
Take her...

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:54.520
Will you say that out loud
so these people can hear you?

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:05.281
Take her out and kill her.

01:09:10.895 --> 01:09:14.791
Now let's get down
to some serious business.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.952
Mac, the spike kit.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:02.640
- Have you got the smack?
- Yeah.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.143
Took some off our late friend the King.

01:10:06.243 --> 01:10:09.012
I wonder where he's king of now.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:22.409
No, thanks. Can't you read the package? It
says smoking is dangerous to your health.

01:10:22.509 --> 01:10:26.372
I didn't know that.
I'm gonna have to give this up.

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:29.166
You ever shoot up before?

01:10:29.266 --> 01:10:32.660
Once or twice.
I can take it or leave it.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.707
That's good. I can take it or leave it.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.377
That's very good.

01:10:42.446 --> 01:10:46.475
Mac, go down along the river,
under the freeway.

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:48.676
Right. Good idea.

01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:27.516
You're luckier than most people
that gotta go out.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:31.937
- This is just about the nicest way to do it.
- Yeah.

01:11:32.037 --> 01:11:35.316
I just want you
to know that, personally,

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:39.653
I think it's a damn shame
to let a good piece like you go to waste.

01:11:39.753 --> 01:11:41.697
Thanks. I do too.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:48.037
Especially when I think of all the fun
I could've had with a stud like you.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.456
Yeah?

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:53.074
You really mean that?

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:57.880
- Well, it ain't too late.
- It ain't.

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:02.041
Hell, no. I can take care
of you right now.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.670
Right here and now.

01:12:06.613 --> 01:12:09.507
Nick, you go take a walk.

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:13.020
Not in my office you don't.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:17.900
You wanna pull that shit,
go on back there someplace.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.475
Hey.

01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:26.023
- Let me do this first.
- Okay. I'm not gonna fight you.

01:12:27.384 --> 01:12:30.319
Mac, shine your light back here.

01:12:31.221 --> 01:12:34.083
Don't look. Don't look.

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.284
Sh, sh, sh.

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.342
Come on, let's go.

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:28.429
- Shit! Hurry up, man.
- Okay. Just a second.

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:33.976
- Come on. Shit, what are you waitin' for?
- All right, all right.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.177
Goddamn zippers.

01:14:01.353 --> 01:14:02.620
Nick!

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:07.217
- What happened?
- She did it. You get her!

01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:10.095
- I'm bleeding. Please help me.
- Mac!

01:14:10.195 --> 01:14:12.264
Get a doctor.

01:14:12.364 --> 01:14:14.600
Mac, take care of him. I'll get her.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.927
Mac! Mac, please help me!

01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:22.098
Get a doctor.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.069
Sugar. Sugar!

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:27.946
Get an ambulance, please!

01:14:28.046 --> 01:14:31.899
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'll take care of that.

01:14:41.393 --> 01:14:43.170
Mac.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:45.621
Mac, don't leave me!

01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:57.675
Mac!

01:14:58.243 --> 01:15:00.344
Come back!

01:15:13.133 --> 01:15:15.318
(HORNS)

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.286
(HORN)

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:23.830
MCHENRY: Help me. Help me.

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:26.365
Help me!

01:17:29.102 --> 01:17:31.672
Help me, somebody!

01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:34.623
Help me! This thing's gonna burn up.

01:17:35.108 --> 01:17:38.252
(SCREAMING)

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:50.148
Hey, baby. You need a ride or anything?

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:53.610
I sure do. I had some trouble
with my boyfriend and got turned out.

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:59.648
That's too bad. Just get right in
and let's see what we can do about it.

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:08.959
Could we stop at a liquor store
and get some juice? I need a drink.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:10.451
Okay.

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.937
Don't go away, beautiful.
I'll be right back.

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:31.138
I won't, baby.

01:18:53.937 --> 01:18:56.705
MAN: Hey! Hey, come on back!

01:19:48.992 --> 01:19:53.105
Gentleman, it does my heart good
to see the various races getting together

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:55.315
in such a spirit of cooperation.

01:19:55.415 --> 01:19:58.902
Yes. I've gotta be going.

01:19:59.002 --> 01:20:03.323
I've got a friend waiting,
I hope, very impatiently.

01:20:03.423 --> 01:20:06.076
- Goin' out to your place at the beach?
- Yeah.

01:20:06.176 --> 01:20:08.704
It's a good life, no?

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:11.906
It can be, Ruben. It can be.

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:16.753
Good night, gentlemen. I hope
we don't have to meet like this again.

01:20:16.853 --> 01:20:19.705
It's been a great risk.

01:21:09.322 --> 01:21:13.384
So I looked at him
and he said "That's all I got."

01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:22.101
The boys should be back now.
I wonder if something went wrong.

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:27.616
I think I hear them coming now.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.942
Sounds like he's really movin'.

01:22:20.393 --> 01:22:23.162
Shit. Come on, now.

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:30.428
- Look, I ain't gonna shoot you.
- Please, don't shoot. Don't shoot.

01:22:30.528 --> 01:22:34.516
I'll pay you anything.
A million dollars. Whatever you want.

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:37.394
A million dollars. You got a deal.
I won't kill you.

01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:39.813
It's Brunswick I want, anyway.
Where is he?

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:43.108
He left. He went to his house
at the beach.

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:45.392
Yeah. I know the place.

01:22:46.586 --> 01:22:48.604
Thanks.

01:22:52.258 --> 01:22:57.237
That's a present from my little sister,
and a nice cop named Carter.

01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:03.188
Hello, Howard. Come on
and sit down and talk to me.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:05.941
I'm not mad at you.

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:08.109
Coffy, baby.

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:11.905
I'm glad to see you.
I knew they weren't really gonna do it.

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:16.024
I ain't here
because they didn't try, lover.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:21.873
They would've done it anyway,
no matter what I said. You know that.

01:24:21.973 --> 01:24:25.502
Yeah, I know.
I told you, I ain't mad at you.

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:28.579
- Why don't you let me have the thing?
- No!

01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:34.344
Before you try to take it, I think you better
know that all your friends are dead.

01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:38.765
Vitroni, Ramos, McHenry
and some others too. I killed 'em all.

01:24:38.865 --> 01:24:40.684
You?

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:43.520
I don't know how I did it.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:46.189
It seems like I'm in a dream.

01:24:46.289 --> 01:24:51.903
And I'm still in this dream, Howard. And it
wouldn't take much for me to kill you now.

01:24:52.003 --> 01:24:57.867
I can see how you might feel that way
but... you don't understand all the facts.

01:24:57.967 --> 01:25:01.204
I did what I did for my people,
for our brothers and sisters.

01:25:01.304 --> 01:25:07.085
You shouldn't talk to me about sisters,
Howard. I've got a sister.

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:11.756
Why don't you just relax
and let me pour you a drink?

01:25:11.856 --> 01:25:14.259
You're upset.
You can see that, can't you?

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:19.139
I can see plenty. I can see how each time
a kid rips off a car or an appliance store

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:21.975
or a house to get money for a fix,
you get your cut.

01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:28.023
Don't be naive. Do you think if I weren't
mixed up with rackets there'd be none?

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:31.276
Wherever there's a need,
somebody comes along to fill it.

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:34.654
Black people want dope,
and brown people want dope,

01:25:34.754 --> 01:25:37.490
and as long as people
are deprived of a decent life,

01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:41.327
they're gonna want something
to just plain feel good with.

01:25:41.427 --> 01:25:45.498
And nothing's gonna change that
except money and power.

01:25:45.598 --> 01:25:48.001
And that's what I'm after, baby.

01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:50.879
Power to change things for our people.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:54.674
I want all that money back in the hands
of black people like you and me.

01:25:54.774 --> 01:25:59.929
Yes, like you too, Coffy. You can help me,
baby, to make a better life for our people.

01:26:00.029 --> 01:26:05.018
Bullshit! You're just sellin' out
to the white gangsters and businessmen.

01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:07.187
You're worse than they are.

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:11.265
And I loved you. I loved you so much.

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:15.945
And you still do, baby.

01:26:16.045 --> 01:26:17.947
You know it.

01:26:18.047 --> 01:26:20.408
And I love you.

01:26:20.508 --> 01:26:25.570
And we're gonna do big things together,
baby, cos you're my woman, Coffy.

01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:32.253
Maybe I have done a few bad things,
but that's the way the world is today.

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:35.381
Sometimes you have to do
a few little wrong things

01:26:35.481 --> 01:26:37.675
in order to do one big right thing.

01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:42.764
That's what I'm trying to do for you and
for our people - that one big right thing.

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:46.935
You always were a good talker, Howard.

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:50.554
You could talk me into almost anything.

01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:56.861
But I don't know.
I just don't know any more.

01:26:56.961 --> 01:27:00.031
All you have to know, baby,
is that I'm your man.

01:27:00.131 --> 01:27:05.120
I'm gonna take care of you
and I'm gonna steer you straight.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.540
I been missing you
these past few days, Coffy.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:12.127
And I've been wantin' you real bad.

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:18.299
Why don't you just put that thing down
and come and fold yourself up in my arms

01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:23.388
and I'll make all this crap go away,
like it's never been.

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:24.722
Come on.

01:27:24.822 --> 01:27:28.675
Howie, what are you doing?
Come back to bed.

01:27:32.288 --> 01:27:36.725
Coffy, baby. You gotta understand,
I thought you were dead.

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.161
