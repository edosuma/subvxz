terrible history

being the central

and defining issue

and a present-day
political reality

02:15.065 --> 02:20.485
103 years after what just about
anyone would call genocide.

02:20.519 --> 02:24.213
Turkey has always
adamantly denied that,

02:24.247 --> 02:27.526
saying it was simply
a messy war.

Yerevan is the capital
of Armenia,

02:33.532 --> 02:36.708
a city of about
one million people.

02:36.742 --> 02:38.227
Mount Ararat looms over it,

02:38.261 --> 02:40.988
a cultural touchstone
and a constant reminder

02:41.022 --> 02:44.474
of what was done
on the other side.

02:49.583 --> 02:51.343
Think of Armenia,
and chances are

02:51.378 --> 02:53.759
you think instead
of an Armenian,

02:53.794 --> 02:58.074
maybe someone you know
or maybe someone on TV.

02:58.108 --> 03:01.595
These guys, for instance,
famous Armenians.

03:01.629 --> 03:03.838
We needed an Armenian.

03:03.873 --> 03:06.841
I needed an Armenian
to push me over the edge,

03:06.876 --> 03:08.326
help me find a window,

03:08.360 --> 03:10.224
a lens with which
to look at a country

03:10.259 --> 03:12.951
which, for some reason,
I'd managed to not visit

03:12.985 --> 03:14.780
on my travels.

03:14.815 --> 03:16.782
Then, this guy reached out...

03:16.817 --> 03:20.441
Serj Tankian, front man
for the Armenian-American band

03:20.476 --> 03:22.581
System of a Down.

03:22.616 --> 03:26.344
And the whole thing
started to fall into place.

03:26.378 --> 03:30.279
Serj first visited Armenia
17 years ago.

03:30.313 --> 03:32.384
Since then, he's performed
a number of shows,

03:32.419 --> 03:34.386
including one
with System of a Down

03:34.421 --> 03:38.252
during the centennial
of the Armenian genocide.

03:38.287 --> 03:39.978
We meet up at Dolmama,

03:40.012 --> 03:41.600
his favorite restaurant
in Yerevan,

03:41.635 --> 03:45.294
and right away I identify
a potential problem.

03:45.328 --> 03:47.088
Well, my first question is:

03:47.123 --> 03:48.987
I understand you're
a pescatarian?

03:49.021 --> 03:51.472
- Yeah.
- How does one...

03:51.507 --> 03:54.234
You're like,
"What the fuck are you doing?"

03:54.268 --> 03:55.649
This is a land-locked country

03:55.683 --> 03:57.961
in the heart of, like,
meat on a stick zone.

03:57.996 --> 03:59.998
Well, I'm interested to see

04:00.032 --> 04:01.682
how you navigate your way
through this week.

04:01.689 --> 04:05.175
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, we've got amazing trout.

04:05.210 --> 04:07.005
And lots of great veggies.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.731
I'm just busting your balls.

04:08.765 --> 04:10.905
Of course you are.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.907
So how Armenian are you?
I mean...

04:12.942 --> 04:14.005
That's a really good question.

04:14.012 --> 04:15.427
You were born in...

04:15.462 --> 04:17.326
Yeah, I was born in Beirut,
grew up in I.A.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.293
I'm Armenian by culture.
Both my parents are Armenian.

04:20.329 --> 04:24.022
My grandparents, you know,
ended up in Syria and Lebanon

04:24.056 --> 04:25.610
because of the genocide.

04:25.644 --> 04:26.956
And how Armenian am I?

04:26.990 --> 04:28.785
That's a really
good question, man.

04:28.820 --> 04:31.167
The majority of Armenians
that live in the Diaspora

04:31.201 --> 04:32.686
didn't voluntarily migrate.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.171
You know, they were...
They were forced migrations,

04:35.205 --> 04:37.449
pogroms, you know,
after the genocide.

04:37.484 --> 04:39.064
So they ended up
in the Middle East and Europe

04:39.071 --> 04:40.694
and different parts
of the world.

04:40.728 --> 04:44.698
So, we have this kind
of feeling of being kicked out,

04:44.732 --> 04:48.046
and that longing is different
than other diasporas I think

04:48.080 --> 04:49.703
because of that.

04:49.737 --> 04:52.153
Diaspora Armenian communities,

04:52.188 --> 04:54.328
wherever they are,
have been held together

04:54.363 --> 04:56.330
by deep feelings of nationalism

04:56.365 --> 04:58.470
and injustice
for what happened to them

04:58.505 --> 05:03.372
and how the world
refused to acknowledge it.

05:03.406 --> 05:05.477
Dolmama specializes
in modern versions

05:05.512 --> 05:08.238
of Armenian classic dishes.

05:08.273 --> 05:10.344
Khashlama, a braised lamb shank

05:10.379 --> 05:12.312
served with rice pilaf.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.141
It's a big little snack.

05:14.175 --> 05:15.901
That is a leg of...

05:15.936 --> 05:18.904
a leg of lamb,
a little guy, yes.

05:18.939 --> 05:20.906
Yeah.

05:20.941 --> 05:23.737
Wow. It's pretty too.

05:23.771 --> 05:26.705
So manti is like
my grandmother used to make it,

05:26.740 --> 05:28.466
but it looks completely
different than this

05:28.500 --> 05:30.226
because this is
vegetarian manti.

05:30.260 --> 05:34.368
They're like little boats
with spices and onions.

05:34.403 --> 05:37.198
You probably thank
Genghis Khan for this.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.579
The dumplings.

05:38.614 --> 05:40.270
He made it happen.

05:40.305 --> 05:42.300
He took all the manuscripts,
killed a million people but...

05:42.307 --> 05:44.827
- But he left you dumplings.
- He left... yeah.

05:44.861 --> 05:47.036
Mmm, that's awesome.

05:47.070 --> 05:49.038
Yeah, this is what
my soul needed.

05:49.072 --> 05:51.903
Good.

05:51.937 --> 05:54.423
What was it like
coming back the first time?

05:54.457 --> 05:56.286
And how old were you,
and what was it like?

05:56.321 --> 05:57.909
I had a mystical connection

05:57.943 --> 05:59.428
because I had never been
to Armenia.

05:59.462 --> 06:01.775
And we had only read about it
in books per se, you know.

06:01.809 --> 06:04.191
Modern Armenia is different

06:04.225 --> 06:06.538
than what I had thought of,
you know,

06:06.573 --> 06:09.438
because it's thriving,
it's young, you know.

06:09.472 --> 06:13.131
It's got a lot
of interesting dynamics.

06:13.165 --> 06:16.583
And I remember the first time
I flew back to I.A.

06:16.617 --> 06:19.206
the feeling that I got
getting out of the plane

06:19.240 --> 06:21.139
is "Why am I back here?"

06:21.173 --> 06:24.314
Like, it was a weird thing
where it's this...

06:24.349 --> 06:27.145
Inescapable feeling
of kind of the land

06:27.179 --> 06:28.457
having some kind of pull

06:28.491 --> 06:29.906
on your blood
or something like that.

06:29.941 --> 06:32.150
Genealogy, I don't know
what it is.

06:32.184 --> 06:35.567
Do you think that Armenia
looks to the West for anything?

06:35.602 --> 06:36.810
Yes, definitely.

06:36.844 --> 06:38.294
I think, you know, culturally

06:38.328 --> 06:39.709
Armenia is very European.

06:39.744 --> 06:42.402
- Culturally? But...
- Culturally.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.542
Politically, it's very much
tied into Russia.

06:44.576 --> 06:46.475
Not just
as an ex-Soviet republic,

06:46.509 --> 06:48.891
but there's a lot of economic
investment from Russia,

06:48.925 --> 06:52.170
and Russia, obviously, based
on the last two world wars

06:52.204 --> 06:54.483
is extremely... what's the word...

06:54.517 --> 06:57.451
They're very afraid
of their borders, let's say.

06:57.486 --> 06:59.729
Yes, they are
acutely sensitive...

06:59.764 --> 07:03.423
- Acutely sensitive.
- To particularly this area.

07:09.498 --> 07:12.673
There are three million
Armenians living in Armenia,

07:12.708 --> 07:15.780
another eight million
around the world.

07:15.814 --> 07:17.506
Ever since the genocide,

07:17.540 --> 07:21.475
it's been a long, existential
struggle for survival.

07:21.510 --> 07:24.927
Recent history is defined
by three major events...

07:24.961 --> 07:26.998
A massive earthquake in 1988,

07:27.032 --> 07:31.140
followed by the collapse
of the USSR in 1991,

07:31.174 --> 07:35.455
and then a full-scale war
with Azerbaijan in 1992.

07:35.489 --> 07:38.319
Not to mention limited
employment opportunities

07:38.354 --> 07:40.494
and most significantly
its borders,

07:40.529 --> 07:43.221
of which approximately
80% have been closed

07:43.255 --> 07:45.361
due to relationships
with its Turkish

07:45.395 --> 07:47.501
and Azeri neighbors.

07:47.536 --> 07:50.780
Things have not been easy
for Armenians.

How many were lost during this?

08:20.603 --> 08:23.364
Most estimates historically

08:23.399 --> 08:25.850
put it around 1.5 million.

08:25.884 --> 08:27.437
That's a lot of people.

08:27.472 --> 08:30.268
Especially a lot of people
when we look at the per capita,

08:30.302 --> 08:32.442
when we look at the impact
this had.

08:32.477 --> 08:36.342
So, what happened?

08:36.376 --> 08:38.828
In the early 20th Century,

08:38.863 --> 08:40.933
what was historically
western Armenia

08:40.967 --> 08:43.212
was under the control
of the Ottoman Empire,

08:43.246 --> 08:45.041
present day Turkey.

08:45.076 --> 08:48.113
Justifying their actions
by the widely held sentiment

08:48.148 --> 08:50.460
that Christian Armenians
would align themselves

08:50.495 --> 08:52.877
with a hostile
and also Christian Russia,

08:52.911 --> 08:55.189
then undergoing
its second revolution

08:55.224 --> 08:56.950
and threatening their borders,

08:56.984 --> 09:00.125
the Turks rounded up
Armenian intellectuals

09:00.160 --> 09:03.059
and summarily executed them.

09:03.094 --> 09:06.615
Military and police units were
dispatched to the countryside

09:06.649 --> 09:09.687
to drive out Armenians
from their villages.

09:09.721 --> 09:12.448
They hanged local leaders
in the town squares,

09:12.482 --> 09:15.140
burned churches,
destroyed manuscripts,

09:15.175 --> 09:18.592
then marched anyone left
towards the Syrian desert,

09:18.627 --> 09:21.664
deliberately starving them
along the way.

09:23.528 --> 09:27.912
Those who survived
scattered across the globe.

09:27.946 --> 09:30.293
They formed large
and vibrant communities

09:30.328 --> 09:32.226
that survive today.

09:32.261 --> 09:34.815
They never forgot the past

09:34.850 --> 09:36.990
and who and what had pushed them

09:37.024 --> 09:38.750
from their homeland.

09:43.790 --> 09:46.102
Let's start with this:
genocide.

09:46.137 --> 09:49.174
Many people seem awfully
and curiously reluctant

09:49.209 --> 09:50.590
to use this word.

09:50.624 --> 09:54.110
As American national
foreign policy,

09:54.145 --> 09:56.009
we use what, "catastrophe"?

09:56.043 --> 09:58.528
Yeah, a "regrettable
series of incidents."

09:58.563 --> 10:00.358
- Yeah, how insulting.
- Yes.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.601
But, I mean, it seems to me,

10:01.635 --> 10:02.947
just as a casual observer,

10:02.981 --> 10:05.846
anytime a state actor
or organization

10:05.881 --> 10:08.504
makes a concerted
and organized effort

10:08.538 --> 10:12.370
to eradicate any ethnic
or national group

10:12.404 --> 10:14.683
that... that's genocide, right?

10:14.717 --> 10:17.375
Yes, what's important
though, however,

10:17.409 --> 10:20.205
is this is our defining issue.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.276
This is the unifying issue,

10:22.311 --> 10:23.553
and it's probably in many ways

10:23.588 --> 10:26.764
the only defining issue,
both good and bad.

10:26.798 --> 10:30.215
For Armenians, both Diaspora
and living here?

10:30.250 --> 10:32.390
Yes, it's the fact that, yes,

10:32.424 --> 10:35.704
my grandfather's a survivor,
every family's touched.

10:35.738 --> 10:38.568
But it's not the personal.
It's also the political.

10:38.603 --> 10:41.951
If Turkey wasn't so adamant
about denying

10:41.986 --> 10:43.712
the historical accuracy,

10:43.746 --> 10:46.059
this is what makes it
a living issue,

10:46.093 --> 10:47.405
a present issue.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.234
- Going forward...
- Mmm-hmm?

10:49.269 --> 10:52.341
Do you think there will be
some kind of reconciliation?

10:52.375 --> 10:53.998
Well, I'm
a little more positive.

10:54.032 --> 10:55.724
This is now the turning point,

10:55.758 --> 10:59.037
Armenia looking to normalize
relations with Turkey

10:59.072 --> 11:02.247
not because of the genocide
but despite the genocide.

11:02.282 --> 11:03.593
Do you have any expectation

11:03.628 --> 11:05.734
of fruitful negotiations
with Erdogan?

11:05.768 --> 11:07.805
It seems to me that
things have...

11:07.839 --> 11:09.530
kind of taken a downward turn.

11:09.565 --> 11:12.741
They have, but it was
never supposed to be that easy

11:12.775 --> 11:14.743
or that quick.

11:14.777 --> 11:17.746
We also need to go beyond
victimization

Lavash, the national bread.

12:03.653 --> 12:07.623
An ever-present feature
of the Armenian table

12:07.657 --> 12:09.556
and a part of everyday life.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.767
Baked on a tonir,

12:13.802 --> 12:15.665
or underground clay oven,

12:15.700 --> 12:20.291
its preparation is passed down
from generation to generation.

12:26.366 --> 12:30.611
Markets like Gum
near the city center

12:30.646 --> 12:32.130
date back to Soviet days,

12:32.165 --> 12:33.822
but they remain a favorite stop

12:33.856 --> 12:36.479
for an older generation
of Armenians.

12:44.177 --> 12:47.283
October brings an array
of seasonal produce,

12:47.318 --> 12:49.458
and Miriam
and her grandmother Leah

12:49.492 --> 12:51.805
pick up ingredients
for a fall tradition...

12:51.840 --> 12:55.222
Ghapama, a rice dish
baked in pumpkin.

13:01.090 --> 13:03.196
The top of the pumpkin
is removed,

13:03.230 --> 13:05.957
and the seeds and pulp
are scraped out.

13:05.992 --> 13:07.925
Dried fruit, almonds, and honey

13:07.959 --> 13:10.997
are mixed with rice
and baked inside.

13:15.311 --> 13:17.866
Incredible.

13:17.900 --> 13:21.386
So, as main course
we prepared Ghapama,

13:21.421 --> 13:22.836
which has its own song.

13:22.871 --> 13:24.804
Serj?

13:27.565 --> 13:30.464
Usually, when you bring in
the dish, you sing it.

13:30.499 --> 13:32.018
We don't cook it very often,

13:32.052 --> 13:33.882
but it's an autumn meal.

13:33.916 --> 13:35.469
We have some pickles there.

13:35.504 --> 13:37.333
We have Armenian cheese there.

13:37.368 --> 13:39.957
And I'm going to serve
Armenian bread.

13:39.991 --> 13:42.373
And this looks like...

13:42.407 --> 13:43.581
It looks like hummus.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.376
- It is hummus.
- That's hummus.

13:45.410 --> 13:46.826
Hummus and bread.

13:46.860 --> 13:47.861
And it's not Armenian.

13:47.896 --> 13:49.725
This is mutabal.

13:49.759 --> 13:51.692
We're not laying any claims
that they're Armenian,

13:51.727 --> 13:53.073
but many western
Armenian families

13:53.108 --> 13:55.213
grow up with this
on the table as well.

13:55.248 --> 13:57.181
Miriam, her mother,
and grandmother

13:57.215 --> 13:59.528
were all born here in Yerevan.

13:59.562 --> 14:02.255
Her husband, Nazareth,
and his family

14:02.289 --> 14:05.258
are more typical
of the diaspora Armenians.

14:05.292 --> 14:08.778
His mom, Nar, was born
in Beirut.

14:08.813 --> 14:11.885
Nazareth, in Toronto.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.508
What language
will your children speak?

14:14.543 --> 14:16.062
Where will they live?

14:16.096 --> 14:18.236
- Here.
- Yeah, here.

14:18.271 --> 14:19.444
No hesitation?

14:19.479 --> 14:21.791
That's the easy question
to answer.

14:21.826 --> 14:23.517
But I think the two of us

14:23.552 --> 14:25.761
would like them to grow up
being equally comfortable

14:25.795 --> 14:27.521
with Armenian, Russian,
and English.

14:27.556 --> 14:30.214
All three languages
are very, very important

14:30.248 --> 14:32.181
for anyone growing up
in Armenia.

14:32.216 --> 14:34.459
They are the two largest
Armenian diasporas,

14:34.494 --> 14:36.427
Russia and America, so.

14:36.461 --> 14:39.568
How many years was it
part of the Soviet Union?

14:39.602 --> 14:43.537
Uh, 70 years, since 1921
more or less until 1991.

14:43.572 --> 14:45.091
So, 70 years.

14:45.125 --> 14:47.852
But what remains of those times?

15:10.979 --> 15:15.293
You sound... wistful
about the old days.

15:15.328 --> 15:18.503
Are things better now or worse?

15:26.028 --> 15:30.308
When Armenia was swallowed up
by the Soviet Union in 1922,

15:30.343 --> 15:34.002
it became the Armenian
Soviet Socialist Republic.

15:34.036 --> 15:36.936
With that came purges
and paranoia

15:36.970 --> 15:38.627
but also a rapid
industrialization,

15:38.661 --> 15:40.836
the evidence of which
is still seen today

15:40.870 --> 15:43.597
in the abandoned factories
and worker's blocks

15:43.632 --> 15:45.634
of another time.

15:45.668 --> 15:49.155
And a Soviet mentality
and sizeable Russian presence

15:49.189 --> 15:52.813
still hang over the country
like a dead weight.

15:52.848 --> 15:57.370
No matter how you felt
about Soviet rule,

15:57.404 --> 16:00.511
the transition was a rough one.

16:00.545 --> 16:03.686
After the collapse
of the USSR in 1991,

16:03.721 --> 16:05.723
Armenia suffered
terrible food shortages

16:05.757 --> 16:07.380
and a ruined electrical grid

16:07.414 --> 16:10.176
that allowed only a couple
of hours of power a day,

16:10.210 --> 16:11.694
if you were lucky.

16:11.729 --> 16:15.491
The worst of those years
would be 1992 to 1994.

16:15.526 --> 16:18.356
But then a few years
after '94 as well.

16:18.391 --> 16:20.041
There was a lot
of pilferage in the beginning.

16:20.048 --> 16:22.705
There was a lot of...
It was dark, dark days.

16:22.740 --> 16:25.674
And the generation
literally learned alphabet

16:25.708 --> 16:27.331
with the candlelight.

16:27.365 --> 16:30.161
Back then, we had only
two hours maybe?

16:35.925 --> 16:37.030
It was something to observe

16:37.065 --> 16:40.033
because during those two hours

16:40.068 --> 16:41.897
someone would go to the balcony

16:41.931 --> 16:43.174
and scream in the yard:

16:43.209 --> 16:45.349
"We have lights,
the electricity is back!"

16:45.383 --> 16:47.730
And everybody would go
do their laundry,

16:47.765 --> 16:49.042
ironing, and cooking.

16:49.077 --> 16:51.527
Everything would be done
in that one hour.

16:57.947 --> 16:59.259
Oh yeah.

16:59.294 --> 17:01.917
But they raised us with love,

17:01.951 --> 17:04.540
and we would play games.

17:04.575 --> 17:07.578
Ma would have her friends
coming over playing guitar.

17:07.612 --> 17:11.202
Looking back, I don't remember
the darkness.

17:11.237 --> 17:12.444
I remember that it was dark,

17:12.479 --> 17:15.448
but emotionally
we didn't feel that.

17:15.482 --> 17:18.934
Parents, grandparents
really did their best

17:18.968 --> 17:20.762
for kids not to feel
the darkness.

17:20.798 --> 17:23.627
It was heroism on their part.

17:23.663 --> 17:24.871
Especially in the winter.

17:24.905 --> 17:26.528
Especially the winter.

17:26.561 --> 17:29.117
But also I think we're observing

17:29.151 --> 17:31.981
a very interesting period
of our history

17:32.016 --> 17:34.605
when change is happening.

Little by little,

19:24.439 --> 19:25.854
in the new Armenia.

They're not ex-pats but re-pats,

19:28.132 --> 19:29.996
people who though not born here

19:30.030 --> 19:33.102
have chosen to come home
and help build a nation.

19:33.137 --> 19:34.828
Well, we grew up
together in Beirut

19:34.863 --> 19:36.416
then moved to the States.

19:36.451 --> 19:38.073
And the reason we moved

19:38.107 --> 19:40.317
was because of
the Armenian thing.

19:40.351 --> 19:41.939
Our kid was growing up,

19:41.973 --> 19:45.770
so we told our friends
we're gonna move,

19:45.805 --> 19:47.190
we need him to go
to Armenian school.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.720
So they said,
"You're going to Armenia?"

19:48.739 --> 19:51.914
I said,
"No, Glendale, California."

19:51.949 --> 19:54.572
But, eventually,
we did move here, 12 years ago.

19:54.607 --> 19:56.264
Living in Glendale

19:56.298 --> 19:57.955
and keeping always saying

19:57.989 --> 20:00.129
you have to keep your identity

20:00.164 --> 20:02.097
was strange.

20:02.131 --> 20:05.963
And every time coming up
with stories for the kids,

20:05.997 --> 20:07.965
you have to love your country,

20:07.999 --> 20:10.554
you're Armenian,
you have to speak Armenian.

20:10.588 --> 20:12.038
Whereas once you're here,

20:12.072 --> 20:13.626
you just forget all about that,

20:13.660 --> 20:16.249
and it's more about being
a good person,

20:16.284 --> 20:18.458
having ambitions, all of that.

20:18.493 --> 20:20.046
And the Armenian part,

20:20.080 --> 20:21.979
you can let that
happen naturally.

20:22.013 --> 20:27.881
Apricot vodka
is a good start to a meal.

20:27.916 --> 20:30.367
Gyan is local favorite,

20:30.401 --> 20:33.301
a restaurant operating out of
what was once a private home,

20:33.335 --> 20:35.993
something of a throwback
to Soviet days

20:36.027 --> 20:38.651
like the Cuban paladars,
when private enterprise,

20:38.685 --> 20:41.309
not to mention the spending
of money on entertainment,

20:41.343 --> 20:46.141
could be frowned on,
and privacy was at a premium.

20:48.212 --> 20:52.837
Trout wrapped and baked
in lavash.

20:52.872 --> 20:55.668
This is not light cooking.

21:01.881 --> 21:04.021
There's certain things

21:04.055 --> 21:06.506
about especially maybe
the last 20, 30 years

21:06.541 --> 21:08.301
of the Soviet Union, '60s on,

21:08.336 --> 21:11.856
that not the brutal, early
Bolshevik Stalinist times

21:11.891 --> 21:14.618
but later on were,
in terms of investment

21:14.652 --> 21:15.964
and culture and education...

21:15.998 --> 21:17.931
Well, I mean, it's very much

21:17.966 --> 21:19.692
a legacy of the Soviet Union.

21:19.726 --> 21:22.281
Armenia was kind of
a nerd republic in a way.

21:22.315 --> 21:24.697
They specialized
in different republics,

21:24.731 --> 21:27.216
and Armenia was where
they concentrated

21:27.251 --> 21:31.359
science, technology,
particle accelerator,

21:31.393 --> 21:33.671
radio telescope, all of that.

21:33.706 --> 21:35.708
And so we benefitted from that,

21:35.742 --> 21:37.641
and you see a lot of
Armenians attributing that

21:37.675 --> 21:39.332
to our "genes" and so on.

21:39.367 --> 21:43.060
But, of course, our genes
are the same as anyone else's.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.683
It's the culture that...
Right.

21:45.718 --> 21:47.264
You know, you take
the good with the bad,

21:47.271 --> 21:50.723
and the good is we're
a cerebral nation in a way.

21:50.757 --> 21:52.656
That's how we grew up.
We like chess.

21:52.690 --> 21:55.141
We're like we're nerds.

22:18.889 --> 22:21.926
Armenia enjoyed
a somewhat celebrated status

22:21.961 --> 22:23.480
during Soviet times,

22:23.514 --> 22:26.345
and Russian influence
is everywhere still.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.347
Chess is taught
in public schools,

22:28.381 --> 22:30.279
a basic life skill.

22:30.314 --> 22:34.249
It's probably the fact that
Armenia was such a powerhouse

22:34.283 --> 22:36.596
of smart, highly educated
brainiacs

22:36.631 --> 22:39.116
with strong backgrounds
in engineering, math,

22:39.150 --> 22:41.256
rocketry, and technology,

22:41.290 --> 22:44.224
a veritable Silicon Valley
of the Caucuses

22:44.259 --> 22:48.436
that largely spared them
the worst of Soviet rule,

22:48.470 --> 22:51.370
and also perhaps the reason
that it continues

22:51.404 --> 22:53.406
to be a leader in IT.

22:53.441 --> 22:56.720
I meet a few members
from the tech community

22:56.754 --> 22:59.136
at a local brewery in Yerevan...

22:59.170 --> 23:02.035
Arthur, an industry writer,

23:02.070 --> 23:04.969
Harot, a software engineer,

23:05.004 --> 23:07.455
and Ruben, a cyber security
consultant.

23:07.489 --> 23:09.940
So what are you making?

23:09.974 --> 23:11.459
What is coming of this?

23:11.493 --> 23:14.427
IT is a big...

23:14.462 --> 23:16.325
- For the country.
- It's a big house.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.051
So, websites,

23:18.086 --> 23:19.881
web based stuff and chip design.

23:19.915 --> 23:21.779
We're all over the place
actually.

23:21.814 --> 23:23.609
But this comes
from the old times, you know.

23:23.643 --> 23:25.438
Like, in Soviet times
what happened is

23:25.473 --> 23:27.095
they manufactured chips,

23:27.129 --> 23:29.166
lots of electronic stuff for...

23:29.200 --> 23:31.340
I heard for Soviet submarines.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.446
But actually it was

23:33.481 --> 23:36.484
a success story
in the Soviet time.

23:36.518 --> 23:38.347
You can have a success story

23:38.382 --> 23:41.143
if you were
a Communist Party official

23:41.178 --> 23:44.008
or if you were doing science.

23:44.043 --> 23:45.941
Or perhaps artist,
and that's it.

23:45.976 --> 23:50.014
And the science was
the most clean career.

23:50.049 --> 23:53.293
I mean, you were not
compromising your own beliefs,

23:53.328 --> 23:55.364
and you were
doing something good.

23:55.399 --> 23:58.816
If you were to imagine
the perfect business

23:58.851 --> 24:01.819
and the most efficient export
for a land-locked nation

24:01.854 --> 24:04.028
with most of its borders closed,

24:04.063 --> 24:06.686
it would be
information technology, right?

24:06.721 --> 24:08.999
Or, to put it simply, brains.

24:09.033 --> 24:11.829
They teach chess in school?
Yes.

24:11.864 --> 24:15.833
In school?
Starting at what age?

24:15.868 --> 24:17.386
Third grade.
My son hates it, he's...

24:17.421 --> 24:19.112
No, second grade.

24:19.147 --> 24:22.391
- So everybody plays chess?
- Yeah, you kind of...

24:22.426 --> 24:24.670
That already is
a very different...

24:24.704 --> 24:25.981
I have a ranking actually.

24:26.016 --> 24:27.776
Really? I didn't know.
Come on.

24:27.811 --> 24:29.502
Small number.

24:29.537 --> 24:32.609
But that's a very different
mentality than most places.

24:32.643 --> 24:36.026
Actually, my mom
took me to chess class.

24:36.060 --> 24:37.959
It was not because
of the country's

24:37.993 --> 24:39.892
like a super nation in chess
or something.

24:39.926 --> 24:42.135
Just she wanted to take me
some place

24:42.170 --> 24:45.345
where, like, I can develop
my brains.

24:45.380 --> 24:48.176
But, actually,
there's a quick answer.

24:48.210 --> 24:50.419
When you are being oppressed

24:50.454 --> 24:52.076
during your history,

24:52.111 --> 24:55.563
knowledge is something
that cannot be taken off you.

24:55.597 --> 24:59.083
Anything can happen.
Soviet Union can collapse.

24:59.118 --> 25:02.017
There can be pogroms.
There can be immigration.

25:02.052 --> 25:05.434
They can take your home.
They can take your fortune.

25:05.469 --> 25:07.333
But knowledge and skill
is something

25:07.367 --> 25:10.543
that remains with you
for all of the time.

25:10.578 --> 25:14.582
And that's why Armenians
are investing in education,

25:14.616 --> 25:16.515
in knowledge, in skill,

25:16.549 --> 25:19.276
to invest in the development
of a child.

25:19.310 --> 25:24.833
All of us are children
that were invested in.

25:24.868 --> 25:29.113
The knowledge is something
that you always keep with you.

25:29.148 --> 25:33.532
I think this explains a lot.

25:47.822 --> 25:50.203
My trip to the disputed,

25:50.238 --> 25:52.758
Armenian-controlled enclave
of Nagorno-Karabakh

25:52.792 --> 25:55.381
requires an early morning stop
at a military base

25:55.415 --> 25:57.383
on the outskirts of Yerevan.

25:57.417 --> 26:01.214
And, apparently,
a flight in this thing,

26:01.249 --> 26:04.770
a smoking, flame-belching,
banged-up looking

26:04.804 --> 26:07.289
Soviet Mi-8 twin turbine chopper

26:07.324 --> 26:09.602
whose appearance
prior to boarding

26:09.637 --> 26:12.398
does not fill me
with confidence.

26:20.337 --> 26:23.236
But, once up in the air,

26:23.271 --> 26:26.446
it takes me over crags
and peaks and steppes

26:26.481 --> 26:28.414
across the international
recognized border

26:28.448 --> 26:30.002
with Azerbaijan

26:30.036 --> 26:33.074
to what the Armenians
call Arstakh,

26:33.108 --> 26:36.905
an isolated pocket
surrounded on all sides

26:36.940 --> 26:39.080
by Azeris.

26:39.114 --> 26:42.083
Whose mountains these are

26:42.117 --> 26:45.811
is a subject of contention
and conflict to say the least.

26:45.845 --> 26:48.607
When the borders of
the South Caucasus were drawn

26:48.641 --> 26:52.024
by the Russian conquerors
some 200 years ago,

26:52.058 --> 26:53.646
a strong Russian presence
kept ethnic

26:53.681 --> 26:55.683
and religious rivalries
in check.

26:55.717 --> 26:58.340
But, whenever disorder
hit Russia,

26:58.375 --> 26:59.997
war has broken out here.

27:00.032 --> 27:03.483
Most recently, after the fall
of the USSR.

27:06.590 --> 27:08.488
The brutal conflict
went largely ignored

27:08.523 --> 27:10.214
internationally.

27:10.249 --> 27:11.664
As with any war,

27:11.699 --> 27:13.459
particularly wars with an ethnic

27:13.493 --> 27:15.668
or religious component
over territory,

27:15.703 --> 27:17.670
it was ugly, murderous,

27:17.705 --> 27:21.812
and with atrocities
committed by both sides.

27:21.847 --> 27:25.057
1992 was a turning point.

27:25.091 --> 27:27.784
The Armenians organized
and created their own army

27:27.818 --> 27:29.786
and, surprising everyone,
pushed through

27:29.820 --> 27:32.064
and took full control
of Karabakh

27:32.098 --> 27:34.583
and the surrounding areas.

27:34.618 --> 27:37.483
These buffer zones
are ethnically Azeri

27:37.517 --> 27:38.898
and bitterly contested

27:38.933 --> 27:41.798
and the subject
of continuing dispute.

27:41.832 --> 27:44.490
There are still
violent confrontations,

27:44.524 --> 27:47.044
the latest being
a four-day battle

27:47.079 --> 27:49.875
in the Spring of 2016.

27:49.909 --> 27:52.153
Russia's role in the conflict

27:52.187 --> 27:54.017
is suspiciously cynical.

27:54.051 --> 27:58.159
They actively arm, support,
and advise both sides

27:58.193 --> 27:59.988
as it appears in their interest

28:00.023 --> 28:04.061
that there be
no lasting resolution.

♪

28:08.203 --> 28:10.447
Travel to this region
continues to be

28:10.481 --> 28:12.345
a particularly sensitive issue,

28:12.380 --> 28:14.589
especially for the Azeris.

28:14.623 --> 28:16.695
Simply by coming here,
I've become,

28:16.729 --> 28:19.283
as I read in the papers
a few days later,

28:19.318 --> 28:24.012
officially persona non grata
in Azerbaijan.

a specialty of the region.

Armenian barbecue.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.229
Meat on a stick,

29:08.263 --> 29:11.611
which is... let's face it...
Always good.

29:14.442 --> 29:17.756
Khorovats.

29:17.790 --> 29:21.311
Armenians try sometimes
to cook it.

29:21.345 --> 29:25.004
Not the same thing.

29:25.039 --> 29:26.661
Armenia and Karabakh,

29:26.695 --> 29:29.146
two different things
or the same?

29:29.181 --> 29:32.011
Not really. Karabakh is...

29:32.046 --> 29:34.255
definitely part of
the Armenian civilization,

29:34.289 --> 29:36.084
the Armenian culture.

29:36.119 --> 29:37.776
I wouldn't separate them.

29:37.810 --> 29:40.468
I think Karabakh is
part of Armenia

29:40.502 --> 29:42.642
but not part of
the Republic of Armenia.

29:42.677 --> 29:44.921
It's like a continuation
of Armenia.

29:44.955 --> 29:46.094
We are the same.

29:46.129 --> 29:47.924
Tegran served in the military

29:47.958 --> 29:51.168

only opposition party.

29:59.176 --> 30:01.938
He now runs a guest house
here in Shushi.

30:01.972 --> 30:05.734
To what extent is this
just a religious conflict?

30:05.769 --> 30:07.074
- No, it's not really.
- Not at all?

30:07.081 --> 30:10.360
- No, no, no, no. Nothing...
- No, no.

30:10.394 --> 30:12.155
This is a Christian island.

30:12.189 --> 30:14.640
Well, this is
Christian island, it's true.

30:14.674 --> 30:15.848
This is Christian island.

30:15.883 --> 30:18.402
But the conflict
of Nagorno-Karabakh

30:18.437 --> 30:19.887
is not religious.

30:19.921 --> 30:22.303
There are people here,
hardliners here,

30:22.337 --> 30:24.823
who refer to Azeris as Turks.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.894
- But they are Turks.
- They are Turks.

30:26.928 --> 30:30.138
- They are Turks, yes.
- Please explain.

30:30.173 --> 30:33.901
I think probably they are
not ident...

30:33.935 --> 30:36.558
They do not bear
historical responsibility

30:36.593 --> 30:39.044
for the actions committed
by the Ottomans.

30:39.078 --> 30:42.254
But the struggle of
the people Nagorno-Karabakh

30:42.288 --> 30:46.051
for their existence is
continuation of the struggle

30:46.085 --> 30:49.261
of Armenian people
to live peacefully on...

30:49.295 --> 30:51.228
In their historical homeland.

30:51.263 --> 30:54.335
I'm not saying that
Azeris and Turks

30:54.369 --> 30:55.784
are the same nations.

30:55.819 --> 30:56.882
But they are Turk nations...

30:56.889 --> 30:58.891
They're working in unison.

30:58.926 --> 31:02.239
Yeah, they're working
in unity today

31:02.274 --> 31:04.000
to isolate Armenia.

31:04.034 --> 31:05.760
Do you think there's a sense

31:05.794 --> 31:07.935
that when people
look at this conflict

31:07.969 --> 31:10.213
they think they look back
and they say

31:10.247 --> 31:11.870
this is what could happen
in the future?

31:11.904 --> 31:13.112
Yeah, absolutely.

31:13.147 --> 31:15.735
It is absolutely
an existential conflict.

31:15.770 --> 31:18.704
If we lose, we know
that we will be destroyed.

31:18.738 --> 31:22.294
Who will help?
Who cares?

31:22.328 --> 31:23.364
Support?

31:23.398 --> 31:24.434
Who will support you

31:24.468 --> 31:26.539
if things once again get ugly?

31:26.574 --> 31:27.740
What do you think the future...

31:27.747 --> 31:29.646
- No one, no one. We.
- No one?

31:29.680 --> 31:32.131
I think there is
a clear understanding

31:32.166 --> 31:33.270
in Armenian society

31:33.305 --> 31:36.032
that we can only rely
on ourselves.

31:36.066 --> 31:38.724
But another reality
is we are paying

31:38.758 --> 31:40.036
very, very high price.

31:40.070 --> 31:44.385
Since 1994, Armenian
and Karabakh sides

31:44.419 --> 31:48.078
lost about 3,000 soldiers.

31:48.113 --> 31:54.429
We are losing our 18,
20 year old sons, you know.

31:54.464 --> 31:56.259
This is sad reality.

31:56.293 --> 32:00.815
And I don't know how
will this situation continue.

32:00.849 --> 32:02.334
I don't know.

32:02.368 --> 32:06.234
I think it's the right time
to drink for peace.

32:06.269 --> 32:08.409
For peace, yeah.

the difficulties

is changing.

35:16.700 --> 35:19.255
It should be a little spicy.

- Good.
- Yeah.

it's a sheep's head but...

35:30.714 --> 35:32.647
- Yes.
- This is called "kalleh."

35:32.682 --> 35:35.340
- "Kalleh." Kalleh.
- In the local language.

35:35.374 --> 35:37.376
When I was kid,
I remember my father

35:37.411 --> 35:40.172
not only went
to restaurant with kalleh,

35:40.207 --> 35:41.863
but he brought it home for us.

35:41.898 --> 35:43.348
- Oh yeah?
- And I was afraid.

35:43.382 --> 35:45.902

Yeah.

35:45.936 --> 35:49.630
Actually, you got
the good part there.

35:49.664 --> 35:52.288
Yeah.

35:52.322 --> 35:53.875
So, let me ask this.

35:53.910 --> 35:58.846
Technology not just here
but Armenia in general

35:58.880 --> 36:02.677
seems to be the major hope
for the future.

36:02.712 --> 36:06.854
What do you think the city
will be like in 20 years?

36:06.888 --> 36:11.203
You know, the history
is not a stable thing

36:11.238 --> 36:13.378
that we can count on.

36:13.412 --> 36:15.656
But what I see 10 years ago
and 10 years now

36:15.690 --> 36:17.830
Gyumri is developing quite fast.

36:17.865 --> 36:20.212
It's really good.
I see really good developments.

36:20.247 --> 36:24.527

I would definitely say that.

36:26.149 --> 36:29.428
It's self-employment
and entrepreneurship

36:29.463 --> 36:31.775
that is developing
among the youth

36:31.810 --> 36:35.607
very, very in a very kind of
fast way these days.

36:35.641 --> 36:38.782
Because people understand
that if you stay in Gyumri

36:38.817 --> 36:41.199
you need to create
your own stuff.

36:41.233 --> 36:43.408
We never should stop.

36:43.442 --> 36:44.754
We never should wait for others

36:44.788 --> 36:47.274
to help our city and ourselves.

36:47.308 --> 36:49.241
We should think,
we should create,

36:49.276 --> 36:51.519
we should use our strong sides

36:51.554 --> 36:53.728
to move forward.

Don't mind us.
We're just Volga'ing.

The ultimate

37:28.832 --> 37:31.456
Corinthian leather, nice.
Yeah.

37:36.184 --> 37:38.463
Wonder what top speed
on this thing is.

37:38.497 --> 37:40.327
I don't want to wonder.

37:40.361 --> 37:41.949
The decelerator
isn't that great.

37:41.983 --> 37:43.433
Right.

Only an hour's drive
from the capital

sits Lake Sevan

So it's the Switzerland
of Armenia?

37:54.858 --> 37:56.860
Dilijan is the Switzerland
of Armenia.

37:56.895 --> 37:59.173
It's one of
my favorite spots actually.

37:59.207 --> 38:00.933
What am I eating today?

38:00.968 --> 38:03.177
I think you're eating
khash today.

38:03.211 --> 38:04.972
Said to be a hangover cure.

38:05.006 --> 38:06.491
That's it, yeah.

38:06.525 --> 38:09.010
It's made out of
legs of cows, I think.

38:09.045 --> 38:11.358
Cool, I like legs of cows.

38:11.392 --> 38:12.359
I like their eyes.

38:12.393 --> 38:14.015
Not to eat but just to look at.

Me too, they're so dreamy.

Okay. Good.

Malina, the proprietor

Khash is what hipster goofs

would call bone broth,

39:08.725 --> 39:14.317
basically a stock flavored
by roasted beef bones.

39:16.284 --> 39:18.045
In Armenian,
we say "khash."

39:18.079 --> 39:20.012
It means just boiled.
Right.

39:20.047 --> 39:22.394
So there is big debate whether
it's Georgian or Armenian.

39:22.429 --> 39:24.914
Of course, every Armenian
is sure it's Armenian.

39:24.948 --> 39:28.193
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

39:29.574 --> 39:32.577
Don't do the lavash first,
please.

39:32.611 --> 39:34.130
We're gonna do the...

39:34.164 --> 39:36.443
Garlic, garlic.
First comes garlic.

39:36.477 --> 39:38.099
I see.

39:38.134 --> 39:39.584
But pay attention to the salt.

39:39.618 --> 39:42.966
If you are not leveling it
with the right level...

39:43.001 --> 39:45.279
Garlic level for you, it's okay?

39:45.313 --> 39:47.108
Yeah, so garlic.
So far so good.

39:47.143 --> 39:49.110
Then, okay, you have
one more plate.

39:49.145 --> 39:50.767
You remove the meat.

39:50.802 --> 39:54.288
Wow, this is...
You take this very seriously.

39:54.322 --> 39:56.739
- Yeah, yeah.
- This is a ritual.

39:56.773 --> 39:57.947
It's a ritual.

39:57.981 --> 39:59.535
Does everybody have
their own style?

39:59.569 --> 40:02.123
Or is this the absolute...
This is the way?

40:02.158 --> 40:03.470
Yeah, but the classics say

40:03.504 --> 40:05.299
you have to eat with your hands.

40:05.333 --> 40:08.302
This is... this is the classics.
You eat with your hands.

40:08.336 --> 40:09.721
Whoever is not eating
with his hands,

40:09.752 --> 40:11.236
they are teasing him.

40:11.270 --> 40:12.996
"Hey, you're a loser"
or something like that.

40:13.031 --> 40:14.619
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:14.653 --> 40:16.483
And you're literally
judged by a person

40:16.517 --> 40:18.726
if he's eating good khash or...

40:18.761 --> 40:20.452
- Yeah, yeah.
- Like, "See the guy?"

40:20.487 --> 40:22.143
He's the first, see the guy.

40:22.178 --> 40:24.456
- Harsh. That's...
- See the guy.

of food, man.

Ayatollah.

40:36.779 --> 40:38.159
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

40:38.194 --> 40:39.851
Okay, we have a saying

40:39.885 --> 40:41.784
when we first come to a house

40:41.818 --> 40:43.095
to a place that hosts us.

40:43.130 --> 40:46.789
We say...
[speaks Armenian]

40:46.823 --> 40:48.653
Which literally means:

40:48.687 --> 40:51.656
"Let my feet bring
luck to this home."

40:51.690 --> 40:58.525
So, let your feet
bring luck to our country,

I think guys with khash
we do like lots of toasts,

41:07.499 --> 41:09.501
but it has to be short.

41:09.536 --> 41:11.676
You can go like Armenian toasts
are very long.

41:11.710 --> 41:14.472
Because people have
to be concentrated on khash.

41:14.506 --> 41:17.371
No, no, no, because it
will get cold.

41:17.405 --> 41:20.892
Yeah, yeah, we were
always between Iran and Rome.

41:20.926 --> 41:24.620
So, we're used to being between
to survive.

41:24.654 --> 41:27.139
You remember you asked
the very first question,

41:27.174 --> 41:30.384
"What is the guy
who comes back to Armenia,"

41:30.418 --> 41:31.730
"what do they feel?"

41:31.765 --> 41:33.560
They feel "I survive."

41:33.594 --> 41:35.700
I did what my grandfather
wanted,

41:35.734 --> 41:37.840
what his great grandfather
wanted.

We are here to survive
no matter is it a war.

this feast.
