male announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.408 --> 00:11.279
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.514
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.547 --> 00:15.483
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.516 --> 00:16.817
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:16.850 --> 00:19.120
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.155
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.792
- AMBER, WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU?

00:24.825 --> 00:28.796
- GOOD THING
I LIKE SLOWPOKES.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.265

00:31.299 --> 00:38.406

00:38.439 --> 00:42.543
- HEY.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.478
YOU SEEING ANYTHING?

00:44.512 --> 00:47.381
- NO, IT'S LATE,
THE MOTHERS ARE GOING IN,

00:47.415 --> 00:49.350
I DON'T THINK
OUR GUY'S GONNA SHOW.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.820
- NO, HE GROPED TEN WOMEN
IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.822
DO YOU THINK
HE'S JUST GONNA STOP NOW?

00:54.855 --> 00:55.823
- IT'S GETTING COLDER.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.825
IT'S HARD TO COP A FEEL
THROUGH A HEAVY COAT.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.160
MAYBE HE GOES SOUTH
FOR THE WINTER.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.394
- OH, COME ON.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.863
- HEY!
WHERE'D YOU GO?

01:02.896 --> 01:06.467
WHERE ARE YOU?
[laughs]

01:06.500 --> 01:08.336
[grunting and panting]

01:08.369 --> 01:10.571
- IS THAT OUR GUY?

01:10.604 --> 01:13.141
- WHOEVER IT IS,
HE'S NOT RIGHT.

01:13.174 --> 01:16.510
- NOT READY?
AMBER!

01:16.544 --> 01:19.180
IT'S A JACKHAMMER!
[laughs]

01:19.213 --> 01:21.182
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

01:21.215 --> 01:22.150
[overlapping shouts]

01:22.183 --> 01:23.417
- EVERYBODY, BACK UP.
BACK UP, BACK UP. SIR!

01:23.451 --> 01:26.187
POLICE.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.589
PUT IT DOWN. BACK UP. LET'S GET
SOME ROOM HERE. BACK UP.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.524
- ROLLINS.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.560
- OH, GOD.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.228
HEY, SIR.
HEY.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.864
- [laughing]

01:36.897 --> 01:38.199
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.602
YOU'RE SUCH
A BITCH.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.837
- WHO THE HELL
YOU TALKING TO?

01:43.871 --> 01:45.473
- MY GIRLFRIEND,
AMBER.

01:45.506 --> 01:49.177
SHE'S RIGHT THERE.
MAKE HER STOP.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.844
- HE'S HALLUCINATING.
HE'S BURNING UP.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.846
- SVU PORTABLE
TO CENTRAL K.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.383
WE GOT A 54
IN THE MEER.

01:55.416 --> 01:59.220
WE NEED A BUS FOR TRANSPORTATION
TO LAGUARDIA PSYCHIATRIC ASAP.

01:59.253 --> 02:02.156
- THE PSYCH E.R.?

02:02.190 --> 02:03.757
UGH,
WHAT FOR?

02:03.791 --> 02:06.394
- HE HAS TO BE CLEARED BY
A SHRINK BEFORE WE CAN BOOK HIM.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.495
- THE GUY IS NOT NUTS.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.363
HE'S HAVING A BAD TRIP.
THAT'S IT.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.265
- COME ON,
YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE

02:11.299 --> 02:13.501
BETWEEN A CHEMICAL WIG-OUT
AND A PSYCHOTIC BREAK?

02:13.534 --> 02:14.902
- YEAH, I CAN.

02:14.935 --> 02:18.172
MOST OF THE TIME.

02:22.343 --> 02:26.247
I GREW UP
AROUND BOTH.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.416
MY SISTER
HAD IT ROUGH, SO...

02:28.449 --> 02:30.951
- WE ALL COME
FROM SOMETHING.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.853
- [chuckles]
- THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.456
COME ON.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.258
CAPTAIN LEE.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.526
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

02:38.559 --> 02:39.860
- DETECTIVE ROLLINS.
- HEY, HOW YA DOIN'?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.028
- ALL RIGHT.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.897
I JUST WATCHED YOU TWO PINCH
THE NAKED FISH ON YOUTUBE.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.933
2,000 HITS.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.868
- READY?

02:47.901 --> 02:49.937
- [groaning]

02:49.970 --> 02:51.071
- ANY IDEA
WHAT HE TOOK?

02:51.104 --> 02:53.574
- YEAH, HE WAS RUNNING AROUND
WITHOUT ANY CLOTHES ON.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.443
COLLAPSING,
NO TREMORS.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.577
IT COULD BE P.C.P.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.579
- PROBABLY.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.848
WE'LL RUN A TOX SCREEN
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.516
RUN AN E.K.G. AND A CAT
ONCE HE'S STABLE.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.817
- HE'S ALL YOURS?

03:03.851 --> 03:05.553
- FOR NOW.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.221
- NO NEED
TO BABYSIT.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.323
WHY DON'T Y'ALL GO HOME?
I GOT THIS.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.459
- SURE?
- YEAH.

03:11.492 --> 03:16.330
- GUESS WE'LL SEE HIM
AT ARRAIGNMENT.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.269
- [groans]

03:21.302 --> 03:23.003
I'M SICK.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.339
PLEASE,
I NEED A DOCTOR.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.274
- SOON AS YOU GET
YOUR E.K.G.,

03:26.307 --> 03:27.808
YOU'RE GOING STRAIGHT TO JAIL.
NOW SHUT UP.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.310
- 10-85.
PATIENT EJECT.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.479
WARD SIX.
NEED ASSISTANCE.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.513
[alarm going off]

03:32.546 --> 03:35.383
- STAY HERE.
YOU MOVE, I POUND YOU.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.318
- GET AWAY FROM ME!

03:37.351 --> 03:40.354
[screaming and commotion]

03:50.364 --> 03:56.370
- [whimpering]

04:00.574 --> 04:03.311
[groaning]

04:12.953 --> 04:14.054
[yelling]

04:14.087 --> 04:16.290
- GET LOST.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.858
SHUT THE DOOR.

04:17.891 --> 04:23.331
SHUT THE DOOR!

04:25.633 --> 04:27.801
- SOMEBODY!

04:27.835 --> 04:29.069
HEY!

04:29.102 --> 04:31.372
HEY, HELP!

04:31.405 --> 04:35.042
RAPE!
RAPE!

04:35.075 --> 04:38.045
[dramatic music]

04:38.078 --> 04:44.284
*

05:23.023 --> 05:24.625
- NEXT CASE?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.927
- PEOPLE VERSUS
DARREN BICKFORD.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.997
ONE COUNT EXPOSURE,
ONE COUNT PUBLIC LEWDNESS.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.064
- HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

05:31.098 --> 05:32.966
- I SAW A GIRL
GET RAPED LAST NIGHT.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.135
- NOT TODAY. COUNSELOR--
- LISTEN TO ME.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.971
A GIRL WAS ATTACKED.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.407
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.841
I'M NOT
MAKING THIS UP.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.444
A GUY
WAS CHOKING HER.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.547
I TOLD THE DOCTORS,
TH-THE GUARDS,

05:46.580 --> 05:50.651
NOW I'M TELLING YOU.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.386
- ARE YOU
THE ARRESTING OFFICERS?

05:52.420 --> 05:53.887
- YES, MANHATTAN SVU,
YOUR HONOR.

05:53.921 --> 05:57.991
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE
HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT A RAPE.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.461
- GOOD, THEN YOU
CAN INVESTIGATE STARTING NOW.

06:00.494 --> 06:03.597
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
MA'AM,

06:03.631 --> 06:06.434
THE SUSPECT WAS APPREHENDED
WHILE MASTURBATING PUBLICLY

06:06.467 --> 06:08.068
UNDER A DRUG-INDUCED
HALLUCINATION.

06:08.101 --> 06:11.439
- WAS HE SEEING THINGS
WHEN HE WITNESSED THE RAPE?

06:11.472 --> 06:15.909
- I WOULD HAVE NO WAY
OF KNOWING, YOUR HONOR.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.545
- THEN DON'T SPECULATE.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.147
WE'LL RECONVENE
IN TWO WEEKS.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.049
I EXPECT TO HEAR
FROM THE PEOPLE

06:22.082 --> 06:25.385
ABOUT THE DEFENDANT'S COMPLAINT
AT THAT TIME.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.192
- A GIRL GOT RAPED.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.461
I SWEAR
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.429
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT WAS A RAPE?

06:35.463 --> 06:38.031
- SHE WAS ON TOP OF HIM,
FACING ME--

06:38.065 --> 06:40.000
- SHE WAS ON TOP?
- YEAH.

06:40.033 --> 06:44.137
BUT HIS ARM WAS AROUND HER NECK,
CHOKING HER.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.138
HER EYES
WERE SHUT TIGHT.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.174
SHE WAS CRYING.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.208
- WHAT DID SHE
LOOK LIKE?

06:48.241 --> 06:53.447
- WHITE GIRL,
DARK BLONDE HAIR.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.048
YOUNG.
I-I DON'T KNOW.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.183
- WHAT ABOUT
THE DOER?

06:56.216 --> 06:57.184
YOU SEE HIS FACE?

06:57.217 --> 06:58.652
- NO,
SHE WAS BLOCKING HIM.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.921
HE YELLED, "GET LOST,
SHUT THE DOOR!"

07:00.954 --> 07:02.556
- DID ANYBODY ELSE
SEE THIS?

07:02.590 --> 07:03.557
LIKE, MAYBE A GUARD?

07:03.591 --> 07:05.926
- I WAS, UH,
ON MY OWN.

07:05.959 --> 07:09.229
LOOK, SHE WAS TRYING TO PULL
HIS ARM FROM HER NECK, AND...

07:09.262 --> 07:12.833
SHE HAD A HOSPITAL BRACELET
AND A-A-A--

07:12.866 --> 07:15.035
A DEEP SCAR ON THE INSIDE
OF HER LEFT ARM.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.538
SHE TRIED TO
KILLED HERSELF.

07:17.571 --> 07:20.040
- THERE'S PLENTY OF SUICIDE
ATTEMPTS IN A PSYCH WARD.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.610
- GO BACK TO LAGUARDIA,
WARD SIX.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.145
SHE'S REAL.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.481
[knock at door]

07:27.515 --> 07:30.518
- KEEP YOUR CLOTHES ON.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.889
- SO WE HAVE A FLASHER
WHO WAS HALLUCINATING,

07:35.923 --> 07:38.258
CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN A GIRL
RAPED AT LAGUARDIA.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.160
CAN'T WE FARM THIS ONE OUT?
- NOT ACCORDING TO THE JUDGE.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.294
- THIS KID WAS
HIGH AS A KITE.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.498
WHO SAYS HE SAW ANYTHING AT ALL?
- THE RAPE WAS, WHAT?

07:44.532 --> 07:47.067
FIVE HOURS AFTER YOU BUSTED HIM?
HE WOULD HAVE COME DOWN BY THEN.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.268
- IF THERE WAS A RAPE,
YEAH.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.670
- WHY WOULD HE LIE?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.872
PUBLIC LEWDNESS,
FIRST OFFENSE...

07:51.905 --> 07:54.975
WHAT'S HE LOOKING AT,
A WEEK OF COMMUNITY SERVICE?

07:55.008 --> 07:56.510
- I DON'T THINK THIS GUY
PREMEDITATES OR EVEN THINKS.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.879
WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION,
WE GO TO LAGUARDIA.

07:58.912 --> 08:02.950
IF THE GIRL EXISTS,
WE FIND HER.

08:04.184 --> 08:04.985
- WE NEED
TO TALK TO YOU

08:05.018 --> 08:07.254
ABOUT ONE OF YOUR
FEMALE PATIENTS.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.122
- WHICH ONE?
- WELL, WE DON'T HAVE A NAME.

08:09.156 --> 08:13.093
BUT SHE'S WHITE, SHE'S MID-20s,
DARK BLONDE HAIR.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.529
SHE'S GOT VERTICAL SCARS
ON HER FOREARM.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.198
- THAT'S GIA ESKAS.
OH, MY GOD.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.033
- WHAT'S SHE
BEING TREATED FOR?

08:20.067 --> 08:21.234
- SORRY, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.369
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

08:22.402 --> 08:24.872
- WELL, WE THINK SHE MAY
HAVE BEEN RAPED LAST NIGHT.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.240
- WHAT? BY WHO?

08:27.274 --> 08:28.275
- WE DON'T KNOW.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.210
THAT'S WHY WE NEED
TO TALK TO HER.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.278
YOU DIDN'T GET
A REPORT?

08:31.311 --> 08:33.180
- NO.

08:33.213 --> 08:36.283
BUT SHE HAD TO BE SEDATED
LAST NIGHT.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.285
- WHY?

08:38.318 --> 08:41.288
IS SHE LUCID NOW?
- SHE SHOULD BE.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.623
I'LL GO IN WITH YOU.
- I'M SORRY, DOC.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.958
IT'S A CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION.

08:48.061 --> 08:52.099
- I GOT A HAIR.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.167
THE COLOR MATCHES
OUR SUPPOSED VICTIM.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.036
- YOU SHOULD FIND PLENTY.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.337
DOCS CRASH OUT HERE
ALL THE TIME

08:57.370 --> 08:59.873
WHEN THEY GOT PATIENTS
ON THE WARD.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.174
- SLEEP'S NOT THE ONLY THING
GOING ON HERE.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.276
CUSHION'S COVERED
IN STAINS.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.878
- A QUICKIE WITH A NURSE
ISN'T RAPE.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.079
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WENT DOWN.
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

09:06.113 --> 09:08.348
YOU LEFT YOUR PRISONER
UNATTENDED.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.919
- HE WAS HANDCUFFED TO
A WHEELCHAIR ON A LOCKED WARD.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.888
- LOOK, I DID VERTICAL PATROLS
IN HOUSING PROJECTS

09:14.922 --> 09:16.657
FOR SIX YEARS,
I GET IT.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.692
THEY EXPECT YOU TO HAVE EYES
IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

09:18.726 --> 09:22.062
- 85 CALL WENT DOWN.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.931
PATIENT GOING BUCK WILD
IN WARD SIX.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.166
ATTACKED AN OFFICER
AND TWO NURSES, ALL HANDS.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.936
- HOW MANY SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
ARE THERE ON THIS FLOOR?

09:28.969 --> 09:30.203
- THERE'S TWO
AT THE VISITORS' DESK.

09:30.237 --> 09:35.876
LET ME, UH,
GET YOU THE FOOTAGE.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.111
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.279
IF IT WAS ONE
OF MY FELLOW INMATES,

09:39.312 --> 09:40.347
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
A WORD THEY SAY.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.949
THEY'RE ALL CRAZY.

09:41.982 --> 09:45.653
- IS THAT A YES
OR A NO?

09:45.686 --> 09:48.088
- GIA?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.890
WILL YOU PLEASE
TELL US?

09:49.923 --> 09:52.626
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN LAST NIGHT?
- THERE YOU ARE.

09:52.660 --> 09:56.263
MOMMY JUST BROUGHT ME SOME
CIGGIES, LET'S--

09:56.296 --> 09:57.264
BAD TIME?

09:57.297 --> 09:58.866
- NO,
NOT AT ALL.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.067
CAGNEY AND LACEY
WERE JUST LEAVING.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.001
- ACTUALLY,
GIA...

10:01.034 --> 10:02.402
IF WE COULD HAVE
ANOTHER MINUTE WITH YOU,

10:02.435 --> 10:04.271
WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT.

10:04.304 --> 10:08.408
SO, GIA, WE HEARD THAT YOU WERE
REALLY, REALLY UPSET LAST NIGHT.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.879
TO THE POINT WHERE
YOU HAD TO BE SEDATED.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.280
WHY WAS THAT?

10:13.313 --> 10:16.249
- UH,
BAD HAIR DAY.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.718
- MAYBE IT WAS
A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.019
- WHO KNOWS?

10:19.052 --> 10:22.122
UH, I'M WORKING
ON FINDING MY TRIGGERS.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.325
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.661
I WAS MAKING
A NOOSE.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.297
THEY CAUGHT ME
RIPPING MY SHEETS.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.167
LAST TIME,
I USED A RAZOR.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.970
I'M A FREQUENT FLIER, YOU'D
THINK I'D GET IT RIGHT BY NOW.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.072
- SO THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE BEEN HERE?

10:39.106 --> 10:41.274
- SOME GIRLS TRAVEL
OR GO TO COLLEGE TO GET AWAY.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.911
ME, I VACATION
AT LAGUARDIA PSYCHIATRIC.

10:43.944 --> 10:48.716
- LET'S GO BACK
TO LAST NIGHT.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.883
YOU RECOGNIZE THIS GUY?

10:49.917 --> 10:52.452
- YOU KNOW, UH,
THEY UPPED MY MEDS.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.021
SO EVERYTHING'S
A BIT FUZZY.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.089
- HE SAID HE SAW YOU
GET RAPED.

10:56.123 --> 10:59.026
- YEAH, WELL, I THINK
I'D REMEMBER IF I'D BEEN RAPED.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.461
- GIA, IF YOU'RE WORRIED OR
AFRAID, WE CAN PROTECT YOU.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.164
- FROM WHO?
MYSELF?

11:04.197 --> 11:06.099
- GIA...

11:06.133 --> 11:09.669
THE BEST WAY TO MAKE THIS
GO AWAY IS WITH A RAPE KIT.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.110
- A RAPE KIT?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.179
- YEAH.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.015
- WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU FIND SOMETHING?

11:22.049 --> 11:27.120
- WILL WE?

11:27.154 --> 11:29.389
- SO IF I DO IT,
WILL YOU LET ME, UH...

11:29.422 --> 11:34.895
WILL YOU LEAVE ME
ALONE?

11:34.928 --> 11:37.130
- SHE WANTS US
TO DO THE RAPE KIT.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.399
SHE KNOWS
WE'LL FIND PROOF.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.035
- OF WHAT?
SEX?

11:42.069 --> 11:44.237
PATIENTS GET IT ON
WITH EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.074
- SHE SHOWS CLASSIC SIGNS
OF ASSAULT.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.076
HYPERVIGILANCE,
FEAR, DENIAL--

11:49.109 --> 11:51.378
- ALL OF WHICH COULD BE SYMPTOMS
OF HER MENTAL ILLNESS.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.313
- WELL, GIA THINKS THAT
NOBODY WILL BELIEVE HER.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.082
I THINK SHE'S RIGHT.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.416
- NO, I'M NOT SAYING
SHE'S A LIAR.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.385
GIA IS NOT EVEN SAYING
SHE WAS RAPED.

11:58.418 --> 12:02.089
AND SHE--SHE COULD BE
DISSOCIATIVE, DELUSIONAL.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.457
I MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF MEDS SHE'S ON.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.895
BUT IF
SHE WAS RAPED,

12:07.928 --> 12:10.063
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD AS HELL
TO GET ANYBODY TO BELIEVE HER.

12:10.097 --> 12:13.100
- WHICH MAKES HER
THE PERFECT TARGET.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.975
- SHE TOLD YOU
SHE WASN'T ATTACKED?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.376
DO YOU BELIEVE HER
OR YOUR WITNESS?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.145
- WELL, SHE DID AGREE
TO A RAPE KIT.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.948
I THINK THAT SHE WANTS US
TO FIND SOMETHING

12:27.981 --> 12:29.983
WITHOUT HAVING
TO ADMIT IT.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.319
- I UNDERSTAND DENIAL,
DETECTIVE.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.988
AND OBVIOUSLY,
IF SOMETHING DID HAPPEN TO HER,

12:35.022 --> 12:36.356
I WANT TO KNOW.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.326
- ALL RIGHT, GIA'S HOUSED
IN A LOCKED WARD, RIGHT?

12:39.359 --> 12:40.393
WHO HAS ACCESS?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.963
- EMPLOYEES,
OTHER PATIENTS.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.932
- ANY ISSUES
WITH THE STAFF?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.399
- OUR PATIENT POPULATION
IS VULNERABLE,

12:46.433 --> 12:49.402
SO EVERY HIRE IS VETTED, AND
THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCUSATIONS.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.904
- SO WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER PATIENTS?

12:50.938 --> 12:53.106
ANYBODY HERE WITH A RECORD
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.408
- NO, WE RUN EXHAUSTIVE
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.543
- HOW ABOUT VISITORS?

12:56.576 --> 12:58.278
- I'LL CHECK,
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

12:58.311 --> 13:01.114
HER MOTHER COMES ON WEEKENDS,
AND SHE'S GIA'S ONLY VISITOR.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.116
- WELL, EVEN SO,
WE'LL NEED A LIST OF EVERYONE

13:03.150 --> 13:04.284
WHO WAS ON THE WARD
ON MONDAY NIGHT.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.020
- OF COURSE.
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME--

13:07.054 --> 13:08.121
- ALSO, IT WOULD BE
A GREAT HELP

13:08.155 --> 13:10.357
IF WE COULD SEE
GIA'S MEDICAL RECORDS.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.125
- YOU KNOW
I CAN'T GIVE YOU THOSE.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.361
- AT LEAST GIVE US
YOUR INCIDENT REPORTS.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.898
'CAUSE IF GIA WAS RAPED,
IT WAS BY SOMEONE ON THIS FLOOR.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.368
- I'LL SEND YOU
WHAT I CAN.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.539
- KILLING A LOT
OF TREES THERE.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.341
YOU PEOPLE
EVER HEAR OF COMPUTERS?

13:28.375 --> 13:32.145
- IT'S GIA'S LAGUARDIA
INCIDENT REPORTS.

13:32.179 --> 13:35.916
SUICIDE ATTEMPTS, SHE FLUSHES
HER MEDS, BUT NOTHING SEXUAL.

13:35.949 --> 13:36.950
- WHAT ABOUT
THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE?

13:36.984 --> 13:40.087
- OF COURSE THE RAPE ROOM
WAS IN THE BLIND SPOT.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.488
SO TARU'S GOING
THROUGH THE REST.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.924
- AND OUR VICTIM CLAIMS
NOTHING HAPPENED TO HER?

13:43.957 --> 13:45.358
- WELL,
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.327
FORENSICS ARE IN
ON HER RAPE KIT.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.530
THEY FOUND SPERM AND OTHER DNA
FROM AN UNKNOWN MALE.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.532
- ANY BRUISING
OR SIGNS OF FORCE?

13:52.565 --> 13:54.367
- NOTHING RECENT.

13:54.401 --> 13:58.171
BUT...

13:58.205 --> 14:03.510
LACERATION SCARS
AND PERIANAL TAGS.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.412
GIA'S BEEN SODOMIZED
FOR YEARS.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.981
- OR THERE COULD BE
A MEDICAL EXPLANATION.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.184
I'M JUST--THIS IS WHY
WE NEED HER RECORDS.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.453
- THAT'S A TOUGH COURT ORDER
TO GET.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.088
- AND IF GIA
IS HIDING CHRONIC ABUSE,

14:15.122 --> 14:16.389
SHE'S NOT GONNA
GIVE US ACCESS.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.492
- IT MIGHT NOT BE
HER CALL.

14:19.526 --> 14:23.330
CONSIDERING GIA'S
PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY,

14:23.363 --> 14:25.398
I'M BETTING HER MOM
IS HER LEGAL GUARDIAN.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.507
- YOU THINK MY DAUGHTER
WAS RAPED,

14:34.541 --> 14:37.377
AND SHE SAYS
SHE WASN'T?

14:37.410 --> 14:41.148
THAT'S FUNNY, IT'S USUALLY
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.251
- YOU'RE SAYING SHE'S MADE
RAPE ACCUSATIONS BEFORE?

14:44.284 --> 14:45.986
- FIRST TIME,
SHE WAS 14.

14:46.019 --> 14:49.222
JUST AFTER HER FATHER
WAS DIAGNOSED

14:49.256 --> 14:51.258
WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.260
SHE ACCUSED
HIS DOCTOR,

14:53.293 --> 14:57.330
A NEIGHBOR,
A MALE TEACHER.

14:57.364 --> 15:00.000
THE SCHOOL NURSE TOLD ME
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A WAY OF COPING

15:00.033 --> 15:01.334
WITH THE LOSS
OF HER FATHER.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.336
[timer buzzes]

15:03.370 --> 15:04.471
OH, UH...

15:04.504 --> 15:06.940
DO YOU MIND?
I HAVE SOME SOUP

15:06.974 --> 15:08.308
ON THE STOVE
IN MY APARTMENT.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.978
MY SISTER'S ON
A RESTRICTED DIET.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.981
- WHERE'S GIA'S FATHER?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.148
- FOUR WINDS.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.017
MENTAL ILLNESS RUNS
IN HIS FAMILY.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.185
AND HE'S BEEN THERE
FOR HOW LONG?

15:18.218 --> 15:21.454
- THE LAST TEN YEARS.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.124
- DID YOU EVER CALL
THE POLICE

15:24.157 --> 15:26.026
AFTER GIA TOLD YOU
SHE WAS RAPED?

15:26.059 --> 15:28.028
- AT FIRST
I WAS GOING TO.

15:28.061 --> 15:31.031
BUT THEN GIA ADMITTED
SHE JUST MADE IT UP.

15:31.064 --> 15:36.369
- A LOT OF VICTIMS RECANT,
MRS. ESKAS.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.239
DID YOU EVER GET
THE SENSE THAT SOMETHING

15:39.272 --> 15:44.477
REALLY DID HAPPEN
TO YOUR DAUGHTER?

15:44.511 --> 15:47.380
- GIA WAS SICK.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.749
LIKE HER FATHER.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.419
[sighs]
I DID THE BEST I COULD.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.155
- NOBODY'S
BLAMING YOU.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.490
- AS GIA GETS OLDER,
IT'S ONLY GOTTEN WORSE.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.492
SHE TAKES HER MEDS,
AND THEN SHE STOPS

15:59.526 --> 16:01.594
BECAUSE SHE THINKS
SHE'S CURED.

16:01.628 --> 16:06.099
SHE SELF-MEDICATES
WITH DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.136
SHE TOLD ME ONCE
SHE WANTS ME TO FIND HER BODY.

16:14.441 --> 16:19.279
SOMETIMES I THINK
MY DAUGHTER HATES ME.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.248
I CAN GET YOU HER RECORDS
IF YOU WANT.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.217
IT'LL TAKE YOU A WHILE
TO GET THROUGH THEM.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.386
IT'S BEEN
A TOUGH ROAD.

16:32.292 --> 16:36.496
- SHE'S GOT A HISTORY OF FALSE
ACCUSATIONS, OF RECANTING.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.498
SHE DOESN'T ADMIT TO
BEING RAPED, I MEAN--

16:38.531 --> 16:40.400
IF YOU WANT TO CALL THE D.A.,
GOOD LUCK.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.135
- LOOK, JUST BECAUSE
A CASE ISN'T WINNABLE

16:42.169 --> 16:43.203
DOESN'T MEAN
WE STOP INVESTIGATING.

16:43.236 --> 16:46.506
- I'M NOT SAYING THAT--
- OFFICERS?

16:46.539 --> 16:47.807
EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.242
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO MY SISTER?

16:49.276 --> 16:50.577
- SHE'S FINE.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.479
- GIA.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.514
[sighs]
WHAT NOW?

16:54.547 --> 16:56.183
I JUST TRIED
TO VISIT HER.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.152
- AT LAGUARDIA?

16:59.186 --> 17:01.088
WHEN?
- MONDAY.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.156
I WAS THERE
FOR MINOR SURGERY.

17:03.190 --> 17:06.459
I BROUGHT HER FLOWERS
BEFORE I WAS ADMITTED.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.461
- BUT SHE WASN'T
IN THE MOOD FOR GUESTS?

17:08.495 --> 17:09.829
- NO, SHE WAS
IN ONE OF HER--

17:09.862 --> 17:12.232
- UM, SHE'S SWEET BUT DRAMATIC.
- SHE'S TROUBLED.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.768
SOMETIMES SHE--SHE TURNS ON
THE PEOPLE WHO CARE FOR HER.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.804
- SO WE'VE HEARD.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.540
- IT MUST BE HARD,
HAVING HER IN YOUR HOME.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.276
- WE CAN'T JUST
ABANDON HER.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.212
MY SISTER--
SHE'S HAD SO MUCH LOSS.

17:25.245 --> 17:28.315
- WE'RE FAMILY.
- BELLA.

17:28.348 --> 17:32.152
BELLA,
COME INSIDE.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.286
I MADE SOUP FOR YOU.

17:33.320 --> 17:37.090
- EXCUSE US.

17:37.124 --> 17:40.427
- DETECTIVE AMARO,
CALL IT A NIGHT.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.830
- I THINK
I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.832
IT'S AN INCIDENT
INVOLVING GIA.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.334
COUPLE DAYS
BEFORE THE RAPE,

17:47.367 --> 17:50.170
SHE GOT HEATED
WITH ANOTHER PATIENT,

17:50.203 --> 17:51.438
UH, JAY DELANEY.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.806
- HOW HEATED?

17:53.840 --> 17:57.310
- JAY WAS SHAKING GIA
LIKE A RAG DOLL.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.778
AN ORDERLY GOT
IN THE MIDDLE.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.080
JAY BUSTED HIS LIP.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.385
- WHAT WAS THE ARGUMENT ABOUT
BETWEEN YOU AND GIA?

18:05.418 --> 18:08.421
- [sighs]

18:08.455 --> 18:09.422
NOTHING.

18:09.456 --> 18:13.293
- YOU SHOOK HER.

18:13.326 --> 18:17.197
- NO, I-I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.466
I OVERREACTED.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.201
UM,
C-CAN YOU--

18:21.234 --> 18:25.472
CAN YOU COME
AROUND HERE?

18:25.505 --> 18:26.606
- BUT I'M RIGHT HERE,
JAY.

18:26.639 --> 18:32.512
DO YOU WANNA TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:32.545 --> 18:34.447
- I--W--
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOUCHED HER.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.149
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.850
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE APOLOGIZED.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.586
DON'T STAND BEHIND ME!

18:39.619 --> 18:41.354
- MY PARTNER ISN'T
DOING ANYTHING, JAY.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.822
HE'S NOT EVEN
TOUCHING YOU.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.791
- J--IT'S--I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN I CAN'T SEE YOU.

18:44.824 --> 18:45.858
- OKAY, JAY?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.427
SO YOU WANNA--
YOU WANNA PUNCH HIM?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.462
YOU WANNA USE THOSE FISTS?
- LEAVE ME ALONE!

18:49.496 --> 18:51.498
- JAY, IS THIS WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND GIA?

18:51.531 --> 18:53.300
HUH? DID YOU SNAP
AT HER LIKE THIS?

18:53.333 --> 18:54.334
- YES--NO!

18:54.367 --> 18:57.237
I--I DIDN'T HURT HER!
- YOU'RE A BIG MAN, JAY.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.405
YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON SOMEBODY,
IT HURTS.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.374
- I LOOK OUT
FOR HER.

19:01.408 --> 19:02.609
- THE ONLY PERSON GIA
NEEDS PROTECTION FROM IS YOU.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.213
- NO!
[screams]

19:06.246 --> 19:08.215
NO! NO!

19:08.248 --> 19:11.318
[screams]
I'M SORRY!

19:11.351 --> 19:17.257
[crying]
I'M SO SORRY.

19:17.290 --> 19:21.294
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.901
- PLEASE LET ME GO BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.970
- AS LONG AS YOU
KEEP ATTACKING COPS, JAY,

19:31.003 --> 19:35.908
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN
ANYTIME SOON.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.311
MAYBE NEVER, UNLESS YOU TELL US
WHAT YOU DID TO GIA.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.981
- WHAT?

19:42.014 --> 19:42.915
I WAS PROTECTING HER.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.452
- OKAY, YOU'RE PROTECTING HER
FROM WHO?

19:45.485 --> 19:50.357
- UM...
A GUARD.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.826
HE MAKES GIRLS GO
INTO EMPTY ROOMS TO--

19:53.860 --> 19:57.497
TO HAVE SEX
WITH THEM.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.931
- WHAT'S
THE GUARD'S NAME?

19:58.965 --> 20:01.934
- HE'LL COME
AFTER ME.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.903
THEY HAVE
ALL THE POWER THERE.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.538
- LISTEN, JAY.
JAY.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.540
JAY,
LOOK AT ME.

20:07.574 --> 20:11.244
YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE YOU,
YOU GOTTA GIVE ME SOMETHING.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.880
- [sighs]

20:13.913 --> 20:17.450
LEE.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.919
OKAY,
HIS NAME'S LEE.

20:19.952 --> 20:20.920
- CHARLES LEE?

20:20.953 --> 20:25.858
- YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

20:35.868 --> 20:36.836
- KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.506
I GOT NOTHING
TO HIDE.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.040
YOU KNOW ME,
FIN.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.310
- NOT ENOUGH
TO LIKE YOU.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.911
- OKAY, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WORE THIS UNIFORM?

20:44.944 --> 20:48.881
- IF THIS IS ABOUT THAT RAPE,
I'M NOT YOUR MAN.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.617
- REALLY?

20:50.650 --> 20:52.519
'CAUSE THESE STAINS
RIGHT HERE ON YOUR ZIPPER

20:52.552 --> 20:56.423
MIGHT TELL A DIFFERENT STORY,
HUH?

20:56.456 --> 21:00.593
- LET'S GO.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.565
- BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.033
- WE SHOULD POSTPONE
THIS INTERVIEW

21:07.066 --> 21:07.834
UNTIL HIS LAWYER
ARRIVES.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.470
- LISTEN TO YOUR UNION REP,
LEE.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.904
LET'S JUST WAIT.
- I DON'T NEED TO.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.040
I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.075
- HAVING SEX WITH A PATIENT
ISN'T WRONG, IT'S CONSENSUAL?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.910
- WHO SAYS I'M HAVING SEX?
JAY?

21:17.944 --> 21:21.314
HE'S SO DOPED UP,
YOU CAN'T TRUST A WORD HE SAYS.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.882
- [sighs]

21:22.915 --> 21:23.983
HAVE A SEAT.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.055
YOU MADE YOUR ROUNDS
MONDAY NIGHT?

21:29.088 --> 21:31.090
- WOULDN'T BE DOING MY JOB
IF I DIDN'T.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.827
- NOW, HAVING SEX
WITH THOSE PATIENTS...

21:34.861 --> 21:35.928
THAT'S NOT PART OF YOUR JOB,
RIGHT?

21:35.962 --> 21:37.364
- NOT A CHANCE.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.965
ANYONE IN
A PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTION

21:38.998 --> 21:42.402
IS INCAPABLE OF CONSENT.
I KNOW THE LAW.

21:42.435 --> 21:45.438
- SO IF WE FIND ANY OF GIA'S DNA
ON THOSE PANTS OF YOURS--

21:45.472 --> 21:48.341
- IT WOULDN'T BE
FROM A RAPE.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.642
THAT WOULD BE ME
DOING MY JOB.

21:49.676 --> 21:53.045
- [scoffs] YOU WANNA RUN
THAT BY US AGAIN?

21:53.079 --> 21:54.947
- THIS IS WHAT I WANNA
TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.416
TUESDAY NIGHT,
THE FRUIT LOOP--

21:56.449 --> 21:57.550
- GIA.

21:57.584 --> 21:58.985
- YEAH,
WHO ELSE?

21:59.018 --> 22:01.554
COMES TO ME WITH THOSE BIG EYES
OF HERS.

22:01.588 --> 22:04.557
CORNERS ME IN A STAIRWELL,
SAYS SHE NEEDS A GUN.

22:04.591 --> 22:08.127
SAYS SHE'LL DO ANYTHING FOR ME
IF I CAN GET HER ONE.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.430
DROPS TO HER KNEES.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.898
- BLAME THE VICTIM?
THAT'S YOUR OFFER?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.132
- OKAY,
SO SLOW DOWN.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.001
SO SHE'S ATTACKING YOU.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.936
- COME ON.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.839
I COULD HAVE STOPPED HER,
BUT I FIGURE...

22:19.872 --> 22:21.040
THE GIRL WANTS
A GUN.

22:21.073 --> 22:24.110
I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO
FIND OUT WHAT SHE'S PLANNING.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.446
- WHAT DID YOU
FIND OUT?

22:26.479 --> 22:28.581
- SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.650
- DID YOU GET HER
A GUN?

22:30.683 --> 22:33.886
- COME ON, LIKE I'D GIVE
A LOADED WEAPON TO A SQUIRREL.

22:33.920 --> 22:34.821
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

22:34.854 --> 22:36.122
- AH, YOU'RE LATE TO THE PARTY,
COUNSELOR.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.123
YOUR CLIENT HAS JUST
BEEN TELLING US

22:37.156 --> 22:38.190
ABOUT HIS UNDERCOVER WORK.

22:38.224 --> 22:41.661
TRADING SEX FOR A GUN
WITH A LAGUARDIA PATIENT.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.463
- I DIDN'T GIVE HER A GUN,
AND IT WASN'T SEX.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.864
IT WAS
JUST A B.J.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.599
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
WE'RE DONE.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.034
- YOU'D BETTER HOPE
BILL CLINTON

22:48.067 --> 22:50.903
IS SERVING
ON YOUR JURY.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.843
ANYBODY BUY THAT?

22:56.876 --> 22:59.446
- HE CONFESSED TO SODOMY.
THAT'S A START.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.514
- I MEAN, THE GUY IS SMARTER
THAN HE LOOKS, YOU KNOW?

23:01.548 --> 23:04.016
HE FUDGED THE TIMELINE,
FUDGED THE SEX ACT,

23:04.050 --> 23:06.018
CLAIMS THAT SHE WANTS
TO GET A GUN FROM HIM.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.120
- IT'S HIS WORD
AGAINST HERS.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.056
- UNFORTUNATELY,
WE DON'T HAVE HER WORD.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.591
- WHAT IF HE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH?

23:11.624 --> 23:14.494
JAY TOLD US THAT
GIA AND LEE

23:14.527 --> 23:16.095
HAD BEEN INTIMATE
BEFORE SHE WAS ATTACKED.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.229
- HOLD ON.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.966
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS
CONSENSUAL SEX WITH A PATIENT.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.168
- NO, I'M NOT ARGUING THAT.
I'M JUST SAYING...

23:22.201 --> 23:25.572
IF SOMEONE ELSE ATTACKED GIA
ON MONDAY,

23:25.605 --> 23:29.175
MAYBE SHE DID GO TO LEE
FOR A GUN THE NEXT DAY.

23:29.208 --> 23:32.178
I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S POSSIBLE.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.213
- HE'S LYING.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.183
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
NOTHING HAPPENED.

23:37.216 --> 23:38.951
- WE TOOK HIS PANTS
FROM HIS LOCKER.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.553
THEY'RE RUNNING
THE DNA RIGHT NOW.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.522
- GIA, WE KNOW
THAT YOU'RE ANGRY

23:42.555 --> 23:44.591
AND AFRAID,
BUT A GUN?

23:44.624 --> 23:45.925
THAT'S NOT
THE ANSWER.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.895
- SAYS THE WOMAN
WHO CARRIES ONE ON HER HIP.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.498
- YEAH, AND BAD THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED TO ME.

23:51.531 --> 23:55.067
I'VE BEEN STABBED.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.203
I'VE BEEN ASSAULTED.

23:57.236 --> 24:01.608
AND MY GUN
DIDN'T SAVE ME.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.679
- I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

24:06.713 --> 24:09.181
SO YEAH,
I GOT ON MY KNEES,

24:09.215 --> 24:11.851
AND THAT SON OF A BITCH LEE
RENEGED.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.153
- I KNOW THAT YOU WERE JUST
TRYING TO PROTECT YOURSELF.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.088
FROM WHO?

24:16.122 --> 24:20.092
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.495
YOU WON'T
BELIEVE ME.

24:22.529 --> 24:24.964
AND NOBODY'S EVER
BELIEVED ME.

24:24.997 --> 24:28.267
- YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.003
YOU TOLD HER YOU WERE RAPED,
AND SHE WOULDN'T BELIEVE YOU.

24:31.037 --> 24:34.173
- CRAZY GIA.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.875
GET HER BACK
ON HER MEDS.

24:35.908 --> 24:40.246
- GIA?

24:40.279 --> 24:41.981
WE BELIEVE YOU.

24:42.014 --> 24:46.686
I BELIEVE YOU.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.928
- ALL IT TOOK WAS FOR SOMEONE
TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME.

24:55.962 --> 25:00.232
[scoffs] I MEAN,
HOW PITIFUL IS THAT?

25:00.266 --> 25:03.169
HE WAS INTERESTED
IN WHAT I HAD TO SAY.

25:03.202 --> 25:06.973
I THOUGHT,
FINALLY...

25:07.006 --> 25:10.176
SOMEONE SEES ME,
YOU KNOW?

25:10.209 --> 25:15.181
[sighs] NOW I JUST WISH
I COULD DISAPPEAR.

25:22.622 --> 25:25.625
- WHO RAPED YOU?

25:29.261 --> 25:33.165
- MY UNCLE...
GEORGE.

25:33.199 --> 25:38.605
[sighs]

25:38.638 --> 25:40.973
THOUGHT I WAS SAFE
IN HERE.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.975
[sniffs] THEN HE GOT IN
AND RAPED ME AGAIN.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.177
THAT'S WHY
I WANTED A GUN.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.981
- HE'S BEEN RAPING YOU
SINCE YOU WERE 14.

25:49.015 --> 25:52.985
- SOMETIMES
IN HIS GARAGE.

25:53.019 --> 25:56.188
UH,
HE HAS CAMERAS,

25:56.222 --> 25:58.324
A COT.

25:58.357 --> 26:02.629
SOMETIMES
IN THEIR BEDROOM.

26:02.662 --> 26:05.231
HE WOULD POSE ME AND,
UH, TAKE THESE PHOTOS.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.667
YOU KNOW THE DRILL,
RIGHT?

26:07.700 --> 26:10.970
SAID IT WOULD BE
OUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.171
- DID YOU EVER TELL YOUR MOM
ANY OF THAT?

26:12.204 --> 26:16.876
- NAH,
THE LOOK ON HER FACE...

26:16.909 --> 26:19.345
SHE WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.614
SEE, GEORGE TAKES CARE
OF HER.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.349
SO IF, UH,
SHE CAN'T MAKE THE RENT

26:23.382 --> 26:28.220
OR GET GROCERIES,
HE COVERS IT.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.990
- SO YOU--YOU FALSELY
ACCUSED OTHER MEN?

26:31.023 --> 26:33.025
BECAUSE GEORGE ZANE
WAS FAMILY?

26:33.059 --> 26:35.962
- UH, THAT'S WHY
I FINALLY GAVE UP

26:35.995 --> 26:39.098
AND JUST TOLD MY MOM
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

26:39.131 --> 26:44.103
- GIA, GEORGE ZANE
IS GOING TO PRISON.

26:44.136 --> 26:48.340
HE WILL NEVER TOUCH YOU
AGAIN.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.276
- YOU CAN'T
PROMISE ME THAT.

26:50.309 --> 26:54.213
UH,
IN THE REAL WORLD,

26:54.246 --> 26:58.651
HE'S SANE,
AND I'M NOT.

27:05.257 --> 27:08.661
- THIS IS GOING TO BE
AN UPHILL BATTLE.

27:08.695 --> 27:09.696
- THAT'S WHY
WE DO IT.

27:09.729 --> 27:12.298
- [sighs]

27:12.331 --> 27:15.434
- YOU TOLD GIA THAT
YOU WERE ASSAULTED?

27:15.467 --> 27:19.972
- YEAH.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.407
- SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME
ON THE JOB.

27:21.440 --> 27:26.879
IT WAS PART OF THE REASON
WHY I HAD TO LEAVE.

27:26.913 --> 27:30.216
- SOMEBODY
YOU WORKED WITH?

27:30.249 --> 27:35.087
- SOMETHING
NOT WORTH PURSUING.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.890
- THAT'S HOW
THEY WIN.

27:37.924 --> 27:40.126
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN TO GIA.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.429
- THIS IS FROM
THE NIGHT OF THE RAPE.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.464
I FOUND GIA'S AUNT BELLA.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.735
SEE? 8:00 P.M., DROPPING
OFF FLOWERS, LIKE SHE SAID.

27:51.938 --> 27:52.905
- YEAH, GEORGE
IS NOT WITH HER.

27:52.939 --> 27:54.006
KEEP GOING.

28:02.014 --> 28:05.918
- HOLD ON, STOP.
8:30.

28:05.952 --> 28:07.219
COULD THAT BE HIM?

28:11.223 --> 28:12.224
- IMPERSONATING
A DOCTOR?

28:12.258 --> 28:13.292
- WELL, HE DIDN'T SIGN IN
ON THE VISITOR LOG.

28:13.325 --> 28:18.497
THE ONLY OTHER WAY IN IS
THROUGH KEY CARD ACCESS.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.900
HE MUST HAVE LIFTED
A BADGE OFF AN EMPLOYEE.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.201
- GO OVER
THE KEY CARD LOGS.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.336
FIND OUT WHOSE IDENTITY
WAS SWIPED.

28:24.370 --> 28:29.141
THEN, GO PICK UP
UNCLE GEORGE.

28:29.175 --> 28:32.378
- TAKE THE COLD STUFF
FIRST!

28:32.411 --> 28:34.313
HOW MANY TIMES DO
I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

28:34.346 --> 28:35.948
- I'M SORRY, BELLA.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:35.982 --> 28:40.086
- AND DON'T BRUISE
THOSE BANANAS!

28:45.024 --> 28:47.026
- GEORGE ZANE.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.428
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE RAPE OF GIA ESKAS.

28:49.461 --> 28:50.963
- WAIT,
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.999
- CALL A LAWYER.
[grunts]

28:53.032 --> 28:54.433
- YOU TELL THEM, DIANE.
GIA'S DOING IT AGAIN!

28:54.466 --> 28:56.936
- IT'S NOT YOUR SISTER'S FAULT,
BELLA. IT'LL BE OKAY.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.237
- LET HIM GO.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.972
MY--MY DAUGHTER'S CRAZY.

29:00.006 --> 29:02.141
- NO, DON'T--
DON'T DO THIS, PLEASE.

29:02.174 --> 29:05.111
- YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S PROBABLY
EXACTLY WHAT GIA SAID

29:05.144 --> 29:08.147
TO YOUR HUSBAND THE FIRST TIME
HE RAPED HER.

29:16.255 --> 29:20.326
- GIA WAS A SWEET GIRL
IN A BAD SITUATION.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.395
HER FATHER
WAS FALLING APART.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.532
HER MOTHER
WAS OVERWHELMED.

29:26.565 --> 29:32.304
BUT SHE BECAME
VERY ATTACHED TO ME.

29:32.338 --> 29:34.907
AND I FOUND MYSELF
ATTRACTED TO HER.

29:34.941 --> 29:40.179
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
THAT I'M A CLICHE?

29:40.212 --> 29:41.413
A MIDDLE-AGED,
MARRIED MAN IN LOVE

29:41.447 --> 29:44.283
WITH A GIRL
HALF MY AGE.

29:44.316 --> 29:48.387
WHAT WE HAVE IS REAL.

29:48.420 --> 29:52.158
- YEAH,
I GET THAT.

29:52.191 --> 29:57.329
YOU'RE--YOU'RE IN A TOUGH SPOT,
GEORGE.

29:57.363 --> 30:00.399
I MEAN--
[scoffs]

30:00.432 --> 30:03.002
THE HEART WANTS

30:03.035 --> 30:07.139
WHAT THE HEART WANTS,
RIGHT?

30:07.173 --> 30:10.176
- I TRIED TO FIGHT IT.

30:10.209 --> 30:13.145
I MEAN,
SHE WAS A TEENAGER.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.547
I DIDN'T TOUCH HER,
NOT FOR A LONG TIME.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.549
IN FACT, I THINK THAT'S

30:17.583 --> 30:20.152
WHY OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS SO STRONG.

30:22.254 --> 30:27.126
I WAS HER FIRST.

30:27.159 --> 30:33.165
SHE WAS SO SHY...
IN HER PINK BRA.

30:33.199 --> 30:37.203
- [sighs] HOW LONG
HAVE YOU TWO BEEN DATING?

30:37.236 --> 30:43.242
- YOU MEAN, HOW LONG
HAVE WE HAD SEX?

30:43.275 --> 30:47.079
I MADE US BOTH WAIT
UNTIL SHE WAS 17.

30:47.113 --> 30:48.080
- THE LEGAL AGE
OF CONSENT.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.982
- I MEAN, IT WAS YOU

30:50.016 --> 30:53.219
WITH GIA IN THE ON-CALL ROOM,
WASN'T IT?

30:53.252 --> 30:56.155
- YEAH.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.356
- THAT PUTS HIM
IN THE ROOM.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.191
- NICE WORK.

30:59.225 --> 31:02.028
- S-SO WE'RE CLEAR,

31:02.061 --> 31:05.497
WHY DOES GIA SAY YOUR
RELATIONSHIP IS NONCONSENSUAL?

31:05.531 --> 31:08.100
TH-THAT YOU'VE BEEN RAPING HER
SINCE SHE WAS 14?

31:08.134 --> 31:11.003
- THE PATIENT'S MENTAL ILLNESS
IS WELL-DOCUMENTED.

31:11.037 --> 31:12.104
WE'LL JUST TELL
YOUR D.A.--

31:12.138 --> 31:15.241
- TH-TH-THE TRUTH IS
SHE'S DRAMATIC.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.344
GIA CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT ME.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.047
UH, SHE'S MADE THREATS
TO KILL HERSELF,

31:21.080 --> 31:24.483
TO HURT HERSELF,
ALL TO--

31:24.516 --> 31:27.386
ALL TO GET ME
TO LEAVE MY WIFE,

31:27.419 --> 31:29.488
WHICH I CAN'T DO.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.157
BELLA HAS CANCER.

31:31.190 --> 31:35.194
- THAT'S WHY HE IMPERSONATED
A DOCTOR TO VISIT THE GIRL.

31:35.227 --> 31:39.265
HE DIDN'T WANT HIS SICK WIFE
TO FIND OUT.

31:39.298 --> 31:42.301
SHOW THEM
THE LETTER.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.586
- MAY I?

32:06.325 --> 32:08.260
"GEORGE,
I LOVE YOU.

32:08.294 --> 32:11.030
--GIA."

32:11.063 --> 32:14.566
- A RAPE VICTIM WOULDN'T SEND
HER ABUSER A LOVE NOTE.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.369
- WE'RE DONE HERE.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.405
- IS MY CLIENT FREE
TO LEAVE?

32:19.438 --> 32:20.739
- NO, WE HAVE SOME FACTS
TO CHECK, COUNSELOR.

32:20.772 --> 32:24.243
WHY DON'T YOU, UH,
COOL YOUR HEELS FOR A WHILE?

32:24.276 --> 32:27.513
- THANK YOU,
GEORGE.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.186
- GOOD WORK.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.255
THAT HUMP NEEDS TO BE
IN LAGUARDIA'S CRIMINAL WING.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.491
SICK BASTARD REALLY BELIEVES
THEY'RE IN LOVE.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.061
- YOU THINK GIA ACTUALLY
WROTE THIS LETTER?

32:42.094 --> 32:44.096
- HE WOULDN'T HAVE PUT IT
ON THE TABLE IF IT WASN'T REAL.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.132
- WELL, GEORGE COULD HAVE
FORCED HER TO.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.134
A TROPHY TO MAKE HIS TWISTED
LITTLE FANTASY SEEM REAL.

32:48.167 --> 32:51.470
- EVEN SO, THE DEFENSE
COULD ARGUE THAT THE LETTER

32:51.503 --> 32:53.472
PROVES
THEIR PRIOR RELATIONSHIP,

32:53.505 --> 32:56.175
THAT GIA LURED GEORGE IN
BY INVITATION.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.144
- I DON'T WANT THIS PRICK
TO SLIP OUT OF THIS.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.278
GO BACK
AND TALK TO GIA.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.347
SEE IF SHE SPOKE
TO ANYBODY ELSE.

33:01.380 --> 33:05.551
- DETECTIVES.

33:05.584 --> 33:10.189
- HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

33:10.222 --> 33:12.058
- TELL THEM, DIANE,
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER,

33:12.091 --> 33:14.360
HOW SHE'S
OUT OF HER MIND.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.229
- ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS
OF GIA'S MENTAL ILLNESS

33:17.263 --> 33:18.164
IS SHE MAKES
THINGS UP.

33:18.197 --> 33:21.233
- WELL, SHE'S NOT MAKING UP
BEING RAPED.

33:21.267 --> 33:24.236
- WELL, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST
TIME THAT SHE'S ACCUSED GEORGE.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.105
TEN YEARS AGO
WAS THE FIRST.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.473
- TELL THEM
THE WHOLE THING.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.376
- GIA WAS UPSET ABOUT HER FATHER
BEING SICK, AND...

33:30.409 --> 33:33.112
SHE WAS ACTING OUT.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.414
SHE ACCUSED GEORGE
OF RAPING HER.

33:35.447 --> 33:38.450
- WHICH WAS A LIE!

33:41.620 --> 33:44.356
- MRS. ESKAS...
[clears throat]

33:44.390 --> 33:47.393
GEORGE JUST CONFESSED TO
A CONSENSUAL SEXUAL AFFAIR

33:47.426 --> 33:49.261
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

33:49.295 --> 33:51.397
- WHAT?
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

33:51.430 --> 33:54.266
- HE SAID IT'S BEEN GOING ON
FOR TEN YEARS...

33:54.300 --> 33:57.136
- WELL, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE LYING!

33:57.169 --> 33:59.105
YOU'RE PUTTING WORDS
IN HIS MOUTH!

33:59.138 --> 34:01.207
THIS IS NOT TRUE.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.308
- THAT IT STARTED
WHEN SHE WAS A TEENAGER.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.143
- NO, NO.
IT CAN'T BE--

34:04.176 --> 34:07.146
- HE SAYS
HE WAS HER FIRST.

34:07.179 --> 34:10.249
HE TOLD US
ABOUT HER PINK BRA.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.351
HE SAYS
THEY'RE IN LOVE.

34:12.384 --> 34:15.154
- OKAY, I WON'T EVEN
LISTEN TO THIS.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.155
I WANT TO
SEE GEORGE.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.456
- HE'S IN CUSTODY.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.858
- WELL, THEN,
WE'RE LEAVING RIGHT NOW.

34:19.891 --> 34:24.463
DIANE?

34:26.498 --> 34:32.504
DIANE, NOW!

34:41.613 --> 34:44.816
- SO MUNCH SAID THAT THEY
BOTH THINK GEORGE IS A SAINT.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.418
- [mutters] YEAH.

34:46.452 --> 34:50.189
BUT GIA'S MOTHER...

34:50.222 --> 34:51.557
SHE'S GOTTA KNOW.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.459
SHE JUST--SHE CAN'T--

34:57.929 --> 34:59.865
TALKING TO GEORGE BEFORE--

34:59.898 --> 35:03.369
LOOK, A GUY LIKE THAT,
RAPING A GIRL,

35:03.402 --> 35:06.405
IN HIS OWN FAMILY
OVER AND OVER AND--

35:09.908 --> 35:11.810
[sighs]

35:11.843 --> 35:14.413
DO YOU THINK I WANTED
TO TALK TO HIM?

35:14.446 --> 35:17.115
I WANTED TO TEAR
HIS HEAD OFF.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.353
- MY OLD PARTNER, HE, UH...

35:21.387 --> 35:23.822
THERE WERE A FEW TIMES
HE CAME PRETTY CLOSE.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.165
- HOW DO YOU HANDLE IT?

35:36.268 --> 35:37.836
- YOU DO
EVERYTHING YOU CAN

35:37.869 --> 35:40.872
TO MAKE SURE HE NEVER
SEES THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN.

35:47.579 --> 35:48.547
- IF HE WALKS--

35:48.580 --> 35:49.581
- HE WON'T.

35:53.519 --> 35:56.522
- HE TOLD YOU
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM?

35:56.555 --> 35:58.524
OH, YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM,
DO YOU?

35:58.557 --> 36:00.626
- NO, WE JUST CAME HERE
TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.861
- YEAH,
LIKE WHAT?

36:02.894 --> 36:05.797
- LIKE, HE PRODUCED THIS,
GIA.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.267
- UGH,
HE KEPT THAT?

36:08.300 --> 36:10.869
I GAVE THIS TO HIM
WHEN I WAS 12.

36:10.902 --> 36:14.373
OH, SO HE'S GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT, RIGHT?

36:14.406 --> 36:17.409
- GIA, IF HE'S GONNA
CLAIM THAT THIS...

36:17.443 --> 36:20.612
RELATIONSHIP
WAS CONSENSUAL,

36:20.646 --> 36:22.281
THEN WE NEED
TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU

36:22.314 --> 36:23.549
AND GO OVER ALL THE DETAILS
THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER

36:23.582 --> 36:24.850
TO PROVE
THAT HE'S LYING.

36:24.883 --> 36:27.953
I KNOW YOU THINK,
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN HERE,

36:27.986 --> 36:31.990
NO ONE'S GONNA
BELIEVE YOU.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.359
THAT AIN'T
WHAT THIS IS.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.960
- COURSE NOT.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.463
'CAUSE I MAKE
THE PERFECT WITNESS, RIGHT?

36:37.496 --> 36:38.630
- GIA,
LISTEN TO ME.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.966
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
EVERY OTHER SURVIVOR

36:40.999 --> 36:43.335
WHO HAS TO TELL THEIR STORY
OVER AND OVER TO GET JUSTICE.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.804
THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT WORKS.

36:45.837 --> 36:49.808
BUT YOU'RE GONNA GET
JUSTICE.

36:49.841 --> 36:54.980
- DOES MY MOTHER KNOW
UNCLE GEORGE HAS BEEN ARRESTED?

36:55.013 --> 36:58.584
- SHE WAS THERE.
YEAH.

36:58.617 --> 37:04.323
- DID SHE TELL YOU
I WAS CRAZY?

37:04.356 --> 37:07.359
[scoffs]

37:14.500 --> 37:18.437
- [sighs]

37:18.470 --> 37:21.807
DO YOU BLAME HER?
I'D GIVE UP TOO.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.811
- GIA SAID THAT GEORGE
MADE HER POSE FOR HIM.

37:25.844 --> 37:29.948
HE HUNG ON TO THIS
ALL THOSE YEARS.

37:29.981 --> 37:34.520
THINK HE KEPT
ANY OTHER TROPHIES?

37:42.394 --> 37:44.463
- NO COT,
NO CAMERAS.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.497
PRETTY CLEARED OUT.

37:45.531 --> 37:49.368
EVERYTHING'S ALL
IN ITS PLACE.

37:49.401 --> 37:51.503
- WELL, NO PHOTOS.

37:51.537 --> 37:54.373
HE MUST HAVE CLEARED THIS PLACE
OUT THE SECOND HE SAW US.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.508
- YEAH. HEY,
WHEN DID YOUR HUSBAND, UH,

37:56.542 --> 37:58.076
CLEAN OUT THE GARAGE,
MRS. ZANE?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.378
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.912
I'VE BEEN RECUPERATING
FROM SURGERY.

38:00.946 --> 38:05.817
- OH, SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR CANCER.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.319
- CANCER?

38:07.353 --> 38:09.388
WELL, SHE JUST HAD
HER GALLBLADDER REMOVED.

38:09.421 --> 38:12.924
- AT LAGUARDIA?

38:12.958 --> 38:15.427
WHY?

38:15.461 --> 38:17.929
THERE'S PLENTY OF GOOD HOSPITALS
NEAR HERE.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.531
- GEORGE WANTED THE BEST SURGEON
AVAILABLE.

38:19.565 --> 38:21.400
- SO IT WAS YOUR HUSBAND'S
DECISION TO GO THERE?

38:21.433 --> 38:22.968
- GIA IS CRAZY.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.970
SHE MADE UP
THE WHOLE THING.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.004
- SO YOU WON'T MIND IF WE
SEARCH THE REST OF THE HOUSE.

38:26.037 --> 38:29.341
- HELP YOURSELVES.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.377
- HIS OFFICE
IS CLEAR.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.378
HOW ABOUT YOU?

38:32.411 --> 38:34.480
- JUST PHOTOS OF THE ZANES'
FAMILY VACATION.

38:34.513 --> 38:35.814
NOTHING OF GIA.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.916
- WELL, HE'S NOT GONNA
LEAVE PICTURES OF GIA

38:37.949 --> 38:39.651
SOMEPLACE WHERE HIS WIFE
COULD FIND THEM, RIGHT?

38:39.685 --> 38:41.487
- NO, BUT HE IS
GONNA KEEP THEM CLOSE

38:41.520 --> 38:43.655
SO HE CAN GET TO THEM
WHENEVER HE WANTS.

38:43.689 --> 38:46.558
- SEE,
I TOLD YOU.

38:46.592 --> 38:49.094
NOW, DIANE AND I HAVE TO

38:49.127 --> 38:50.596
PUT EVERYTHING BACK
WHERE IT BELONGS.

38:50.629 --> 38:54.466
- WHAT'S THAT
UNDER YOUR BED?

38:58.604 --> 39:01.139
- THAT'S JUST
GEORGE'S TOOLBOX.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.575
- DOES HE USUALLY KEEP IT
UNDERNEATH THE BED?

39:03.609 --> 39:06.044
- YEP,
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.079
- NO,
IT HASN'T.

39:08.113 --> 39:13.452
- DIANE,
OF COURSE IT HAS.

39:13.485 --> 39:16.455
- NO, IT'S NEVER
BEEN THERE BEFORE.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.557
- DIANE, STOP IT.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.492
- IT'S NEVER BEEN THERE.

39:20.526 --> 39:22.461
I WOULD KNOW.

39:22.494 --> 39:26.565
I'VE CLEANED YOUR HOUSE
FOR 15 YEARS.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.467
- IT'S A COMBINATION PADLOCK.

39:28.500 --> 39:33.605
- UH, WHEN IS
YOUR HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY?

39:33.639 --> 39:35.040
- GEORGE'S?

39:35.073 --> 39:38.076
SEPTEMBER 29th.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.548
- MM-MM.

39:42.581 --> 39:45.116
- MY SISTER'S?

39:45.150 --> 39:49.555
JUNE 16th.

39:58.063 --> 40:01.099
- WHEN IS
GIA'S BIRTHDAY?

40:01.132 --> 40:03.201
- DIANE.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.904
COME ON!

40:05.937 --> 40:08.940
- 4/24.

40:14.680 --> 40:19.084
- BINGO.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.465
IN HER PINK BRA.

40:33.499 --> 40:38.069
JUST LIKE GEORGE SAID.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.505
- YOU KNEW!

40:39.538 --> 40:43.542
YOU KNEW,
AND YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING!

40:43.575 --> 40:45.477
- THAT IS A FAKE!

40:45.511 --> 40:47.946
HE WOULDN'T.

40:47.979 --> 40:51.082
TELL THEM.
TELL THEM!

40:51.116 --> 40:54.085
- HE IS YOUR HUSBAND.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.887
IT HAPPENED IN YOUR BED.

40:55.921 --> 40:57.155
SHE'S YOUR NIECE!

40:57.188 --> 40:59.124
WE WERE A FAMILY!

40:59.157 --> 41:01.493
HOW COULD YOU
LET THIS HAPPEN?

41:01.527 --> 41:04.996
[crying]
OH, MY GOD.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.134
OH, MY GOD.

41:09.167 --> 41:13.572
- "ON APRIL 24, 2001."

41:15.206 --> 41:17.509
ON HER 14th BIRTHDAY.

41:17.543 --> 41:22.581
- GIA.

41:22.614 --> 41:25.116
WHAT HAVE I--

41:25.150 --> 41:29.087
OH, MY GOD.

41:29.120 --> 41:34.626
[sobs]

41:36.628 --> 41:38.263
- GEORGE ZANE IS LOOKING
AT MULTIPLE COUNTS

41:38.296 --> 41:41.967
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT
GOING BACK TEN YEARS.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.270
- THAT'S 25 YEARS
FOR EACH COUNT.

41:45.303 --> 41:48.239
- IT'S OVER, GIA.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

41:48.273 --> 41:53.278
HE'S NEVER GETTING OUT.

41:53.311 --> 41:56.915
HAS YOUR MOM COME
TO SEE YOU YET?

41:56.948 --> 41:58.917
- NO.

41:58.950 --> 42:01.987
AND I DON'T WANT HER TO.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.221
I MEAN, I KNOW I'LL HAVE
TO FORGIVE HER

42:03.254 --> 42:04.322
TO MOVE ON, BUT...

42:04.355 --> 42:07.593
[scoffs]

42:07.626 --> 42:11.897
NOT TODAY.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.999
- YOU SOUND STRONG.

42:14.032 --> 42:18.303
- DR. WHITMERE WARNED ME
IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

42:18.336 --> 42:21.172
IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG ROAD BACK.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.908
I'LL PROBABLY
SCREW IT UP.

42:22.941 --> 42:26.578
- NO.
NO, YOU WON'T.

42:26.612 --> 42:30.048
- I KNOW THAT IT'S HARD
TO IMAGINE RIGHT NOW,

42:30.081 --> 42:35.954
BUT YOU SURVIVED
THE ABUSE, GIA.

42:35.987 --> 42:39.224
YOU'RE GONNA SURVIVE
THE RECOVERY.
