00:09.677 --> 00:15.183
<i>NARRATOR". Ambergris Bay outside
Gotham City, where the elite flee the heat.</i>

00:17.769 --> 00:20.897
It's a lovely beach house, Bruce.

00:21.648 --> 00:23.983
I really haven't used it very much.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.778
Now that my youthful ward, Dick Grayson,
is growing up...

00:26.945 --> 00:30.448
...he needs a place to entertain his friends.
-it's just perfect for that.

00:30.615 --> 00:34.619
And I must say I'm honored
that you asked me to help chaperone his party.

00:34.786 --> 00:37.455
Here come the beachcombers.
Better get the hot dogs ready.

00:37.622 --> 00:40.500
Bruce, I think we were followed from the beach,
but I don't know why.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.461
All we did was pick up some old bottles,
some driftwood...

00:43.628 --> 00:46.381
...and a bunch of stuff that looks like
soaked graham bread.

00:46.548 --> 00:49.092
Soaked graham bread?

00:51.052 --> 00:53.721
Do you know what this is, Dick?
It's ambergris.

00:54.138 --> 00:57.141
You mean that stuff given forth by whales
from which they make perfume?

00:57.308 --> 00:58.643
Mm-hm.

00:58.810 --> 01:04.566
Ambergris has a strange fixative quality
which allows perfumes to retain their scent.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.819
A lump this size should be worth a fortune
on the perfume market.

01:08.528 --> 01:09.571
Gosh. Let's go back...

01:09.737 --> 01:13.074
- ...to see if we can get some more.
- Not so fast, junior.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.785
Hand over that whale grease.

01:17.036 --> 01:19.497
Aren't you gentlemen
being a little presumptuous?

01:19.664 --> 01:21.082
This is private property.

01:21.249 --> 01:24.294
We'll take off, Mac,
when we get what we came after.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.837
Hand it over.

01:29.299 --> 01:31.342
Bring the kid and Mr. Wayne along too.

01:32.677 --> 01:35.221
You, Mac, and junior, come along with us.

01:35.388 --> 01:38.016
- You can't just barge in--
-This says we can, lady.

01:38.182 --> 01:40.184
Come on, get moving.

01:46.316 --> 01:48.860
I'll introduce myself later, Mr. Wayne.

01:50.361 --> 01:54.240
I'm sorry, sir,
but Batman is out of the city for a day or so.

01:54.407 --> 01:57.035
No, sir. Master Robin's with him.

01:57.201 --> 02:01.039
Heh, no, I'm afraid I wouldn't know
how to reach them, sir.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.707
What?

02:02.874 --> 02:05.627
Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson
kidnapped at gunpoint?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.545
L-- I-- But--

02:09.505 --> 02:13.051
I'm sorry if I appear a trifle upset, sir...

02:13.718 --> 02:18.598
...but any citizen of Gotham City
would be shocked at such appalling news.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074

03:46.936 --> 03:49.021
Oh, this ambergris will help me greatly...

03:49.188 --> 03:53.609
...to convert your priceless lilacs
to priceless oil of lilacs, Louie.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.319
That's good, honey. Good.

03:55.486 --> 03:59.699
But making perfume,
even for such an expert as I...

03:59.866 --> 04:05.037
...requires other fixative agents
to set the staying powers in the scent.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.290
Well, name them, Lotus. Name them.

04:07.457 --> 04:12.170
Nothing is going to stop me from cornering
the lilac perfume market of Gotham City.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.046
And the lilac soap market, Louie.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.256
The soap market too.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.175
And the lilac cosmetics market.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.302
Cosmetics too.

04:19.844 --> 04:20.887
What do you need, baby?

04:21.053 --> 04:26.184
Well, I need scent pouches
of a number of Abyssinian civet cats.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.602
All right, sure, sure.

04:27.769 --> 04:31.564
The glands
of as many muskrats as possible.

04:31.731 --> 04:33.232
Muskrats, sure, sure.

04:33.399 --> 04:37.904
And a large supply of beaver castor follicles.

04:39.197 --> 04:40.615
Sure, sure.

04:40.782 --> 04:44.035
And the Tonquin from a herd of musk deer.

04:47.413 --> 04:48.456
You heard that, boys.

04:48.873 --> 04:52.543
Glands we know about, Louie.
But what is follicles and Tonquins?

04:53.669 --> 04:57.006
What are you, dumb or something?
Don't you understand what she's saying?

04:57.173 --> 05:01.260
She's talking about, uh, scent pouches,
that's what she's talking about.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.888
You guys go and round up the animals,
you understand?

05:04.055 --> 05:06.557
And when you catch them,
put them in the basement.

05:06.724 --> 05:09.560
Now, get going. Get going. Move.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.903
Mr. Wayne,
you're gonna remove those pouches.

05:20.404 --> 05:25.451
I hear you're an international sportsman
and an authority on animals.

05:34.085 --> 05:35.503
How are you doing?

05:35.670 --> 05:37.588
Not too well.

05:37.755 --> 05:41.175
I'm trying to reach Alfred
on my two-way transistor wristwatch.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.930
I seem to be getting a slight beep
from the receiver, but the sender's dead.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.685
What are you two mumbling about?

05:51.018 --> 05:53.604
Just passing the time of day, Louie.

05:53.771 --> 05:58.150
Let's hope the authorities pass over the million
dollars I'm planning to ask for you shortly.

05:58.693 --> 06:01.487
That's a high price for two average people.

06:02.238 --> 06:03.865
We're all ready, commissioner.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.825
What's this? Home movies?

06:05.992 --> 06:09.829
We can get no lead whatsoever
on the whereabouts of the Caped Crusaders.

06:09.996 --> 06:12.290
But we have been able,
with some rapid research...

06:12.456 --> 06:16.252
...to put together some filmed coverage
of their most outstanding exploits.

06:16.419 --> 06:19.672
Maybe we can find out
some new crime-fighting techniques from it.

06:19.839 --> 06:22.091
- Yeah.
-Okay, Jim.

06:29.307 --> 06:36.105
Now, first, is where that Western bad man,
Shame, cornered them in a cattle stampede.

06:45.406 --> 06:51.203
And next is when Robin, the Boy Wonder,
was almost eaten alive by a giant clam.

06:56.167 --> 07:00.880
And in this one,
Mr. Freeze is making them into Frosty Freezes.

07:05.301 --> 07:07.345
And here they are chasing King Tut.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.683
That's enough, Jim.

07:13.184 --> 07:15.686
Not much help, anyway.

07:19.315 --> 07:21.817
<i>- Yes, Bonnie.</i>
<i>- The director of the Gotham City Zoo...</i>

07:21.984 --> 07:24.987
<i>-...is on your private line, commissioner.</i>
- Thank <i>you, Bonnie.</i>

07:25.154 --> 07:26.989
Yes, Mr. Buck?

07:28.324 --> 07:30.785
Yes, Mr. Buck.

07:31.369 --> 07:35.331
All the Abyssinian civet cats, beavers...

07:35.498 --> 07:40.544
...muskrats and musk deer
in the zoo are gone?

07:42.713 --> 07:46.717
Sorry, but we're as much in the dark as you are
regarding this distressing development.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.053
We have not been contacted
by the kidnappers...

07:49.220 --> 07:52.556
...so I have no idea why they're holding
Mr. Wayne and Master Grayson...

07:52.723 --> 07:55.643
...and the police have not been able
to reach Batman or Robin.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.979
Mrs. Cooper is upstairs in a state of shock...

07:58.145 --> 08:01.732
...and I appeal to you
to respect what is left of our privacy.

08:01.899 --> 08:06.112
Now, thank you, gentlemen.
Good day. Thank you so much. Yes.

08:06.696 --> 08:08.447
Ms. Gordon.

08:13.119 --> 08:16.122
Your phones have been busy for hours, Alfred,
so I decided to come out here.

08:17.540 --> 08:21.794
If you'll excuse me.
No doubt another concerned inquiry.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.259
Yes?

08:28.426 --> 08:29.719
Oh, Governor Stonefellow.

08:29.885 --> 08:32.804
How very thoughtful of you to call, sir.

08:32.972 --> 08:35.099
No. No, we've had no word. No--

08:38.059 --> 08:40.395
Uh, I beg your pardon, sir?

08:40.563 --> 08:43.024
What? No. No, of course.

08:43.190 --> 08:47.570
Yes. Well, uh, I'll tell Mrs. Cooper, of course.

08:47.737 --> 08:50.865
And, uh, thanks for your concern.

08:51.032 --> 08:54.160
Ah-ah. Careful. It's a very dusty duster.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.121
I thought I heard something
bleeping under it.

08:59.874 --> 09:01.250
Hmm? Oh, heh.

09:01.417 --> 09:04.628
The, uh, friendly ghosts
of stately Wayne Manor...

09:04.795 --> 09:07.048
...play occasional tricks on one's ears.

09:07.214 --> 09:11.927
The friendly ghosts have certainly provided
Mr. Wayne with an impressive personal library.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.971
And what a lovely head of Shakespeare.

09:14.138 --> 09:15.639
No, don't touch that.

09:15.806 --> 09:16.891
I'm sorry, Ms. Gordon...

09:17.058 --> 09:20.478
...but it's a prized possession
of my missing employer...

09:20.644 --> 09:24.523
...and, uh, in the distressing
circumstances, l...

09:24.690 --> 09:26.192
Of course, Alfred. I understand.

09:26.567 --> 09:30.529
And those distressing circumstances
are what I came out here to talk to you about.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.490
For reasons too numerous to mention...

09:32.656 --> 09:37.328
...I strongly suspect Louie, the Lilac has
kidnapped Mr. Wayne and his youthful ward.

09:37.495 --> 09:39.789
Louie, the Lilac? Did you tell your father?

09:40.164 --> 09:42.541
No. My father wouldn't take me seriously.

09:42.708 --> 09:46.879
After all, he knows nothing
of my other identity.

09:48.506 --> 09:53.052
But if you hear anything or get any messages,
please contact me.

09:53.219 --> 09:55.721
It's going to be difficult
without Batman or Robin...

09:55.888 --> 09:58.099
...but maybe Batgirl alone
can do something.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.267
I'll contact you, of course.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.896
Thank you, Alfred.
I'll see myself to the door.

10:08.234 --> 10:11.529
<i>NARRATOR". With Bruce Wayne and
Dick Grayson kidnapped and held hostage...</i>

10:11.695 --> 10:13.906
<i>...in the defunct fragrance factory...</i>

10:14.073 --> 10:18.744
<i>...while Louie, the Lilac
and lovely Lotus plot to pillage...</i>

10:18.911 --> 10:21.705
<i>...and plunder the world of perfume...</i>

10:21.872 --> 10:27.002
<i>...give us a moment
to untangle this trickily-tangled skein.</i>

10:32.133 --> 10:35.261
The defunct fragrance factory
on Lavender Lane?

10:35.427 --> 10:37.388
Where did you get that tip, Alfred?

10:37.555 --> 10:40.975
An, uh, anonymous informant, miss.

10:41.392 --> 10:44.937
I'll check it out at once,
and thanks for calling me.

10:45.855 --> 10:48.858
Well, Charlie, Batgirl rides again and alone.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.449
Who are you? What are you doing here?

10:57.616 --> 11:01.579
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
I'm the maintenance man, the new one.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.748
I thought you were out, so I took my keys
and came up the back way.

11:05.082 --> 11:08.419
The people downstairs were complaining
about the grinding noise up here.

11:08.586 --> 11:10.921
Did you know that this wall revolves?

11:11.297 --> 11:13.048
I know the wall revolves.

11:13.215 --> 11:17.094
Apparently, it was built to do just that
for a previous tenant.

11:17.261 --> 11:21.765
Uh, but, sir, you don't have to pry it open.
I usually use this door.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.559
Where does it go?

11:23.726 --> 11:25.436
To a secret closet behind the wall.

11:25.603 --> 11:27.980
I use it for extra storage space.

11:28.147 --> 11:29.690
Would you like to see it?

11:29.857 --> 11:34.278
Well, sure, sure.
I'm a sucker for secret closets.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.207
- Right this way.
-Yes, ma'am.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.921
Not much, is it?

11:52.087 --> 11:54.548
Nothing for the neighbors
to complain about.

11:55.925 --> 11:58.802
- I don't know what they're talking about.
-Neither do I.

12:00.304 --> 12:03.682
And as you say,
you never use the revolving door anyway.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.267
No, no, of course not.

12:05.434 --> 12:11.482
Well, I'm very sorry I surprised you, lady.
I really am. And I'll never do it again.

12:11.649 --> 12:14.860
Yes. Well, it's not very wise of you.
I keep several guns here.

12:15.027 --> 12:18.280
And an innocent maintenance man
makes a pretty good target sometimes.

12:18.447 --> 12:23.577
Oh. Don't you worry, lady. I'll never use
my passkey to come in the back way again.

12:23.744 --> 12:24.995
Never.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.998
And, uh, you can make book on that.

12:28.165 --> 12:31.168
Bye, now. Bye.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.172
That was a close call, Charlie.

12:51.063 --> 12:56.777
<i>NARRATOR". So once again, Barbara Gordon
begins her tantalizing transformation.</i>

12:59.947 --> 13:03.784
<i>And shortly emerges
from her secret exit as Batgirl.</i>

13:03.951 --> 13:09.290
<i>Even as the Batmobile arrives in Gotham City
during a passing shower...</i>

13:09.456 --> 13:12.042
<i>...without a driver...</i>

13:12.334 --> 13:15.546
<i>...which Alfred is explaining
to his abducted employer.</i>

13:15.713 --> 13:18.048
I trust you're receiving me, sir,
wherever you are.

13:18.215 --> 13:22.011
<i>And wherever you are,
I believe I've located you. Help is on the way.</i>

13:22.177 --> 13:24.972
I'm advising Commissioner Gordon
of your whereabouts...

13:25.139 --> 13:28.892
...and I took the liberty of sending in
the Batmobile by remote Bat-control...

13:29.727 --> 13:33.230
<i>...in case it can do its bit, sir. Over and out.</i>

13:33.814 --> 13:35.024
Hear that?

13:35.190 --> 13:37.735
Most of it.
Too bad there's no way to get back to him.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.404
Now what are you two mumbling about?

13:46.744 --> 13:49.079
What's that awful odor?

13:50.080 --> 13:51.665
It's all over the place.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.960
Saffron and Sassafras must have arrived
in the basement...

13:55.127 --> 13:58.756
...with the Abyssinian civet cats,
the muskrats...

13:58.922 --> 14:01.342
...and the beavers and the musk deer.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.761
We sure did.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.765
And you intend to make perfume
out of those smelly animals?

14:07.931 --> 14:10.976
Oh, no, Louie. Out of their glands.

14:11.143 --> 14:14.480
Oh, yes.
Which Mr. Wayne is going to remove.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.482
Untie our prisoners, gentlemen.

14:16.648 --> 14:19.151
Don't bother, Lilac.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.945
I have no intention
of performing that operation.

14:22.112 --> 14:25.366
It's illegal.
It's nothing short of criminal mutilation.

14:26.533 --> 14:33.040
I'm sure hunger, thirst and exhaustion
will help you change your mind about...

14:33.999 --> 14:36.043
...cooperating with me, Mr. Wayne.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.670
<i>NARRATOR".

14:38.837 --> 14:42.633
...as <i>the driverless Batmobile arrives
on Lavender Lane?</i>

14:42.800 --> 14:45.803
<i>Next, Batgirl.</i>

14:48.680 --> 14:52.017
<i>And finally, the police.</i>

15:04.196 --> 15:05.697
News travels fast, Batgirl.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.492
And apparently,
Batman and Robin even faster.

15:08.659 --> 15:12.121
Some seventh sense must have told them
the dire dilemma facing Gotham City.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.998
Right, begorra. And brought them home.

15:15.165 --> 15:18.252
If they're inside this defunct factory,
perhaps we can help them.

15:18.419 --> 15:20.337
Flanagan, the horn.

15:22.423 --> 15:25.259
Louie, the Lilac,
Police Commissioner Gordon speaking.

15:25.426 --> 15:26.927
We have you surrounded.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.430
Come out with your hostages
with your hands raised.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.723
And with that herd of animals
you've hijacked.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.184
What will we do now, Louie?

15:34.685 --> 15:36.061
Just this.

15:36.228 --> 15:39.982
I have my own bullhorn
right here in my lilac boutonniere.

15:41.525 --> 15:44.945
Commissioner Gordon, it's lilac time for you,
commissioner.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.865
Do you hear me? Lilac time.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.951
So vacate this area
along with your men at once.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.621
One move to interrupt what I have planned
will result in the demise...

15:54.788 --> 15:58.792
...of millionaire Bruce Wayne
and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.545
Batman and Robin can't be inside yet.

16:02.087 --> 16:04.590
Perhaps they've gone around back
to find a way in.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.967
Sure, and it's possible.

16:07.134 --> 16:10.053
The Dynamic Duo would never-- What--?

16:10.220 --> 16:12.306
What happened to Batgirl?

16:12.639 --> 16:15.559
Oh, well, apparently,
she's gone to join them.

16:15.726 --> 16:18.187
We'll stay right where we are
and see what happens.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.397
Flanagan, on the alert.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.401
Louie, the police haven't left yet.

16:24.568 --> 16:27.446
And the Batmobile's out there
and that putt-putt of Batgirl's.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.448
And Batgirl's in here.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.909
No, Batgirl. Get out. Quick.

16:32.326 --> 16:33.785
Grab her! Grab her!

16:38.499 --> 16:39.583
He's stunned her.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.586
With some invisible spray
from his lilac boutonniere.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.255
Now I have three hostages.

16:45.422 --> 16:49.092
And if anyone tries to invade this place,
they will die instantly.

16:49.259 --> 16:52.846
Lotus, what do you call the process
for extracting the scent from blossoms?

16:53.013 --> 16:58.894
Maceration.
When the flowers are steeped in vats of hot oil.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.813
Hot oil, of course.

17:01.980 --> 17:05.817
Bar all entrances.
Lock the cellarvvay into the basement.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.112
When the Dynamic Duo
and those dandelions make their appearance...

17:09.279 --> 17:12.699
...they'll be greeted
by a unique new fragrance:

17:13.700 --> 17:17.119
Cologne de Batgirl.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.750
So the minutes tick by...

17:21.916 --> 17:25.170
<i>...and Batgirl is placed in a macerating vat...</i>

17:25.337 --> 17:30.342
<i>...into which Lotus
will shortly pump boiling oil.</i>

17:36.265 --> 17:38.267
Just a minute, Louie.

17:40.561 --> 17:43.730
If you'll spare that brave young girl's life...

17:43.897 --> 17:46.316
...I'll remove the scent pouches
from those animals.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.026
Sounds like a fair deal.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.862
I have your word? You'll let her live?

17:52.864 --> 17:57.160
Killing Batgirl was never part
of my original plan, Mr. Wayne.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.580
What equipment would you need
for your operation?

17:59.746 --> 18:02.916
I'll need two glasses of warm water.

18:04.668 --> 18:06.503
Two glasses of warm water?

18:06.670 --> 18:11.883
Yes, warm water plays a major part
in newly-perfected animal surgery.

18:12.050 --> 18:15.470
Okay. Untie them.

18:16.096 --> 18:20.851
Give them two glasses of warm water
and lock them in the basement.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.691
Batgirl dies anyway.

18:27.858 --> 18:30.569
I was hoping you'd say that, Louie.

18:30.736 --> 18:32.487
Are you ready?

18:32.738 --> 18:34.072
No, not quite.

18:34.865 --> 18:38.118
The oil won't flow freely
until it's really boiling.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.876
There's your two glasses
of warm water, Mac.

18:46.043 --> 18:49.463
And down there are your pungent patients.

18:57.471 --> 19:00.682
Gosh, Bruce. Those muskrats
and musk deer are sure musky.

19:00.849 --> 19:04.645
- Forget them. There's not much time.
-But what are we gonna do with the water?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.271
Here, hold them.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.318
What are those?

19:11.485 --> 19:13.403
The latest invention of Batman.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.947
Instant unfolding Bat-costumes...

19:16.657 --> 19:18.575
...complete with utility belts.

19:18.742 --> 19:19.826
Drop it in the water.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.335
Watch.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.253
They're opening up.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.465
Like those paper Chinese flowers do
when they're dropped in water.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.592
Isn't the oil boiling yet?

19:35.759 --> 19:40.097
Just starting.
I can pump it into the vat in a moment.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.019
Holy finishing touches.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.773
But now what?
That door's bolted on the other side.

19:49.940 --> 19:54.444
That window, we use our Bat-hooks
and our laser bar cutter. Let's go.

19:55.946 --> 19:58.323
What in the world
could be happening in there?

19:58.490 --> 19:59.991
Maybe he's killed them all.

20:00.158 --> 20:03.495
-Including Batman and Robin.
-He didn't kill Batman and Robin.

20:03.787 --> 20:06.206
We were trying to break in a rear entrance,
no luck.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.500
We saw enough
to believe Batgirl's in danger.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.795
If you can loan us your shoulders,
we'll break in the front way.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.880
Yes, certainly. Right, boys, give them a hand.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.466
All right, here we go, boys. Follow me.

20:16.633 --> 20:19.136
Right over this way. Here we go.

20:24.975 --> 20:27.144
Get them, get them, get them!

21:35.921 --> 21:38.882
Tell me something, Batgirl.
How did you get out of that vat?

21:39.049 --> 21:40.967
With my Batgirl vat opener.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.054
After Louie's knockout spray wore off.

21:44.387 --> 21:47.140
We'd better get Bruce Wayne
and Dick Grayson. They're in the basement.

21:47.307 --> 21:50.018
We'll take care of that, Batgirl.
You've had a tough day.

21:50.185 --> 21:54.523
You go outside and get Commissioner Gordon
in here to pick up this lavender mob.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.149
Right.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.153
Let's hurry, Robin.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.828
All right, men, round them all up here.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.871
Take them over there.

22:14.417 --> 22:17.420
There's one thing you may not know
about lilacs, commissioner.

22:18.255 --> 22:23.677
The rarest of them all, genus Louie,
may be cut way back...

22:24.845 --> 22:27.264
...but always grows again...

22:27.597 --> 22:29.266
...and never dies.

22:29.432 --> 22:30.851
Take him away, Jim.

22:34.604 --> 22:37.774
Believe me, we're grateful
that you're all still alive.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.651
Where are Batman and Robin?

22:39.818 --> 22:42.445
Say, that's right.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.573
That's odd.

22:44.739 --> 22:49.035
Oh, they just kept going.
They said they had pressing business.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.663
The Batmobile, it's gone.

22:51.830 --> 22:52.998
That's right.

22:53.164 --> 22:55.041
How did you do it?

22:55.208 --> 22:57.794
The sending device in my watch
started working again.

22:57.961 --> 23:01.965
I was able to tell Alfred
to activate the Batmobile's remote controller.

23:02.132 --> 23:04.217
The Dynamic Duo may be gone,
but that basement...

23:04.384 --> 23:08.555
...is full of Abyssinian civet cats,
muskrats, beaver and musk deer.

23:08.722 --> 23:11.474
And gosh, do they smell terrible.

23:15.645 --> 23:19.983
Well, another canny, colorful crook
is in the clink.

23:20.150 --> 23:24.029
That tuckered-out police commissioner
is gonna breathe much easier...

23:24.195 --> 23:26.948
...on his West Cape cruise.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.577
West Cape cruise?

23:30.744 --> 23:33.246
I think I've earned myself a little vacation,
Bruce.

23:33.413 --> 23:37.459
And the department's in good hands
with Chief O'Hara at the helm.

23:37.626 --> 23:41.338
- When do you leave, commissioner?
-End of the week. Why?

23:42.213 --> 23:44.174
Uh, it's just that...

23:44.507 --> 23:48.511
You look as though I were committing
some sort of criminal act by taking a vacation.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.639
As I was saying, commissioner...

23:50.805 --> 23:54.351
...Gotham City is planning a civic luncheon
in your honor next week.

23:54.517 --> 23:55.727
My honor?

23:57.020 --> 23:58.563
It was supposed to be a surprise.

23:58.730 --> 24:01.316
But now the cat's out of the bag.

24:01.483 --> 24:04.569
Well, there goes the West Cape cruise.

24:05.028 --> 24:06.947
I'm deeply touched.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.325
And, uh, just between the four of us, I, uh--

24:10.492 --> 24:14.496
I'll certainly try to act surprised
at this, uh, surprise luncheon.

24:16.706 --> 24:21.461
<i>NARRATOR". Commissioner Gordon won't have
to act surprised at the affair in his honor.</i>

24:21.628 --> 24:24.047
<i>He's going to get the surprise of his life...</i>

24:24.214 --> 24:28.802
<i>...from that dauntless champion
of women's rights, Ms. Nora Clavicle.</i>

24:28.969 --> 24:30.553
He certainly is.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.848
Especially when he discovers...

24:34.015 --> 24:38.103
...he's ex-Police Commissioner Gordon.
