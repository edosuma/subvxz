Target sighted.

00:32.232 --> 00:35.934
<i>Observation. That could only</i>
<i>be Superman's secret hideaway.</i>

00:35.969 --> 00:39.772
It has all the charm of
a Kryptonian condominium.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.107

(POWERING UP)

01:21.248 --> 01:23.982
A Superman robot.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.650
Inferior.

01:25.685 --> 01:27.352
But not even
the real Man of Steel

01:27.387 --> 01:32.424
will stand between me and
what I am here to retrieve.

01:32.459 --> 01:36.294
You're telling me
there's an entire city,
with real people in there,

01:36.329 --> 01:39.397
-breathing, eating, shopping?
-Mostly shopping.

01:39.432 --> 01:43.001
Actually, the city of Kandor
was famous for its massive
shopping center,

01:43.036 --> 01:44.336
the Mall of Krypton.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.104
It's the capital
of my home planet,

01:46.139 --> 01:48.273
before Brainiac
miniaturized it.

01:49.809 --> 01:51.643
Hopefully,
we'll change all that.

01:53.813 --> 01:55.080
The Kryptonite's set,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.948
there's just enough
to weaken you

01:56.983 --> 01:59.551
so that
my white-dwarf tech
can take effect.

01:59.586 --> 02:00.819
At least, in theory.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.053
Then let's do it.

02:02.088 --> 02:03.422
You sound in a hurry.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.959
I'm going home, Cyborg.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.863
(BEEPING)

02:12.499 --> 02:15.000
ATOM: System's up.
Kryptonite assimilated.

Initiating
white-dwarf transfer.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.506
Cellular absorption

02:21.541 --> 02:25.077
And the big, blue boy scout
is going Smallville.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.449
How do you feel?

02:31.318 --> 02:32.250
Excited.

02:32.285 --> 02:33.552
Be sure you bring back

02:33.587 --> 02:35.387
all the tissue samples
I requested.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.422
<i>If we're gonna return Kandor</i>
<i>back to normal,</i>

02:37.457 --> 02:39.824
<i>we have to test</i>
<i>its molecular stability.</i>

02:39.859 --> 02:41.693
Remember,
Kandor's artificial red sun

02:41.728 --> 02:44.996
means you'll be entirely
without superpowers
once you enter.

02:45.031 --> 02:46.798
There is no threat
to me there.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.467
The only kind
of hunters down there
are bargain hunters.

-At last, we finally meet.

a son of Krypton returns.

04:08.548 --> 04:12.417

04:24.664 --> 04:26.298
I suppose it's all going well,

04:26.333 --> 04:28.300
or we would have
heard something.

04:43.216 --> 04:47.052
Life-forms recognized,
Atom and Cyborg.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.422
The two of you will surrender
the Bottle City of Kandor.

04:50.457 --> 04:55.226
You got faulty data, Brainiac.
This is the Bottle City of...

04:55.261 --> 04:56.328
Cleveland.

04:56.363 --> 04:59.631
Beep, beep, error.
You are lying.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.800

Falling is arrested.
Kandor is preserved.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.264
At last.

05:33.299 --> 05:36.267
My collection is complete.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.370
No, not again.

05:38.405 --> 05:39.871
Not if I can help it.

05:45.412 --> 05:48.046
Observation. Superman absent.

05:48.081 --> 05:52.084
Reaction.
My visit is well timed.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.186
(STRAINING) Must move.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.255
Can't move.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.424
Very embarrassing.

Atom, you're okay!

Oh, yeah.

Now, let's go get Kandor back.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.141
I got news for you Tiny,

06:16.176 --> 06:19.177
Brainiac's blast was
some sort of advanced EMP.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.781
Even if you could
get me on my feet,
I'd just fall on my face.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.249
I need time to reboot.

06:27.454 --> 06:30.822
Until then,
I'll have to improvise.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.827
When I get back
to my laboratory,

06:35.862 --> 06:38.130
I will add you
to my collection.
