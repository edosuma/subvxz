WEBVTT

00:12.229 --> 00:13.926
Hey, Dave. What's going on?

00:13.970 --> 00:16.016
Oh, hey, Calvin. Just picking upmy new lawn signs

00:16.059 --> 00:17.582
for the campaign.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.932
What do you think?

00:21.369 --> 00:23.153
I think you're gonna look greatwith a blacked out tooth

00:23.197 --> 00:24.981
and the word "dork"
across your forehead.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.681
Yeah, I didn't think about
the kids vandalizing my signs.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.857
Who said anything about kids?

00:33.207 --> 00:35.035
So you're really gonna
go through with this?

00:35.078 --> 00:38.081
Hell, yeah. Look, we need
stronger schools, safer parks,

00:38.125 --> 00:39.735
and when it comes
to our city government,

00:39.778 --> 00:42.433
we need to have
an open dialogue.Well, great.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.566
You open that one,and I'll close this one.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.698
I'm serious, Calvin.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.352
We need strong representation,

00:48.396 --> 00:50.615
and we haven't been getting
it from Isaiah Evans.

00:50.659 --> 00:54.271
Look, Isaiah has beenour councilman for a long time.

00:54.315 --> 00:55.533
People love him.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.187
He led the march on Washington.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.189
You mean with
Martin Luther King?

00:59.233 --> 01:02.584
No. The marchon Washington Boulevard.

01:04.151 --> 01:07.197
We wanted that Chipotle,and he got it for us.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.504
Okay, but that was
a long time ago,

01:09.547 --> 01:11.245
and he hasn't done
anything since.

01:11.288 --> 01:13.769
Calvin, don't you want someone
who's gonna roll up his sleeves

01:13.812 --> 01:15.466
and make an impact
on this community?

01:15.510 --> 01:18.426
Nope. I don't like governmenttelling me what to do.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.254
I got Tina for that.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.866
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:23.909 --> 01:25.085
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.007
Hi, this is Dave Johnson.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.270
I'm running for city council,

01:36.313 --> 01:38.054
and I'm calling
to ask for your support.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.710
Yeah, I'm the white guy.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.800
Well, yes, Dave is the one

01:44.843 --> 01:47.019
who got the speed bumpput in on Evergreen.

01:48.717 --> 01:51.023
Oh, you hit it too hardand messed up your alignment?

01:52.677 --> 01:54.723
Well, take it on down
to Calvin's Pit Stop

01:54.766 --> 01:55.898
and vote for Dave Johnson.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.996
Grover, you are
licking too slow.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.781
You are dabbing when
you should be sliding.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.305
Here, let me show you.

02:11.348 --> 02:14.482
Ah... Aah! Paper cut!

02:16.179 --> 02:19.487
Now you're bleedingwhen you should be dabbing.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.970
So, I was thinking of invitingthe women from the neighborhood

02:25.014 --> 02:27.408
for an elegant
ladies' afternoon.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.410
You know,
put out the good china,

02:29.453 --> 02:31.934
serve some tea and scones.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.589
Tea and scones?Is Dave going to be a councilman

02:34.632 --> 02:35.851
or a Disney princess?

02:38.854 --> 02:40.334
I'm just trying to help him.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.987
Most of the neighborhood
just knows him

02:42.031 --> 02:44.860
as the jogger in short shorts
who's terrified of squirrels.

02:47.645 --> 02:48.777
Hey, hey.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.300
Ooh, well, well, well.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.476
Look who showed up to volunteer.

02:52.520 --> 02:56.524
So, Calvin, you finally ready
to ride the Dave wave?

02:57.873 --> 02:59.266
No.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.181
Tina told me
there was a deli tray.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.486
Forget the Dave wave.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.401
I'm ready
to jump on the ham tram.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.232
You know, I don't get it.Why won't you support me?

03:09.276 --> 03:10.886
I supported youwhen Old Miss Kim accused you

03:10.929 --> 03:12.192
of stealingher garden gnome.

03:12.235 --> 03:14.019
That's because I didn't do it.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.456
I was just the lookout.

03:17.109 --> 03:19.068
I'm serious, Calvin.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.897
You know, people around herereally look up to you,

03:21.940 --> 03:24.769
and your endorsementcould help my campaign.

03:24.813 --> 03:27.990
And I'd give it to you, Dave,
except for one small problem.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.818
This deli tray has

03:29.861 --> 03:31.515
a better chance of winning
than you do.

03:32.603 --> 03:35.476
Ooh, spicy mustard.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.131
I wouldn't underestimatemy husband.

03:39.175 --> 03:41.351
Back in Kalamazoo,he got them to shut down

03:41.395 --> 03:42.874
the strip clubnext to the school.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.267
Oh, good for him.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.834
Yeah, I was so proud.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.445
Even though it put
half my cousins out of work.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.580
This isn't Kalamazoo.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.364
This neighborhood is 80% black,

03:54.408 --> 03:56.801
and Dave is 100% white.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.196
110% when he wears his Crocs.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.721
You know, so what if I'm white?

04:03.765 --> 04:05.593
This community will vote
for the best person

04:05.636 --> 04:07.116
for the job.That's what I believe.

04:07.159 --> 04:09.988
And I believe I'm gonna
take my sandwich to go.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.295
All aboard
the ham tram!

04:12.339 --> 04:14.558
Toot, toot!

04:19.302 --> 04:22.262
Well, I hope
you're happy.

04:22.305 --> 04:25.003
Oh, I am. You know,
I had my doubts at first,

04:25.047 --> 04:27.615
but spicy mustard
was the way to go.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.358
I'm talking about Dave.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.273
We're all over there
supporting him.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.927
Why won't you?Because

04:35.971 --> 04:37.407
I don't want him to look like

04:37.451 --> 04:39.496
the white guy
who thinks he knows better,

04:39.540 --> 04:42.760
swooping in to fix
all the black folks' problems.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.371
If I wanted a white savior,

04:44.414 --> 04:46.982
I'd watch Sandra Bullock
in The Blind Side.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.422
Calvin, you love that movie.

04:52.466 --> 04:53.902
I don't love that movie.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.730
I just said,
"Don't change the channel."

04:56.774 --> 04:59.299
Okay, you're right.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.605
Some people may think
Dave is that way.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.868
But that's not who he is,
and you know that.

05:03.912 --> 05:06.915
That's because
I'm an evolved man, Tina.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.222
You can't expect
the rest of the neighborhood

05:10.266 --> 05:12.312
to be as open-minded as me.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.316
Open-minded?
Seriously?

05:16.359 --> 05:17.839
You refuse to
watch a movie

05:17.882 --> 05:19.493
if it has subtitles.

05:19.536 --> 05:23.018
If I wanted to read,
I'd get an audiobook.

05:25.020 --> 05:28.632
All I know is Dave cares
about this community.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.155
Councilman Evans

05:30.199 --> 05:31.809
has been coasting for years.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.202
All he ever does is brag

05:33.245 --> 05:34.986
about the time
he met Eddie Murphy.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.988
Tina, but you got to admit,

05:37.032 --> 05:39.034
that's a great storyright there.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.340
I mean,

05:40.383 --> 05:42.646
the same car washon the same day?

05:42.690 --> 05:44.692
That's destiny.

05:46.258 --> 05:49.044
Okay, fine. Do what you want,
but I'm supporting our friend.

05:49.087 --> 05:51.742
So am I. I'm protecting him.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.832
I don't want to see anybody
attack or ridicule him.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.357
You ridicule himall the time.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.533
But I do it
from a place of love.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.273
What?

06:01.317 --> 06:02.492
I love doing it.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.237
Calvin, I can't tell you

06:08.280 --> 06:10.065
how much it means to
have your endorsement.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.936
Oh, I'm notendorsing you.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.156
I just brought youto the barbershop to show you

06:14.199 --> 06:16.288
what the people around herethink about you running.

06:16.332 --> 06:18.203
:Plus, I can't wait

06:18.247 --> 06:21.642
till the fellas hear howyou shut down the strip club.

06:23.687 --> 06:26.168
Well, you'll see. I'm gonna
get plenty of support.

06:26.211 --> 06:29.084
After all, you know, I'm
down with Que and the guys.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.477
I just brought a
squash casserole

06:30.520 --> 06:31.913
over to the shop last week.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.697
Dave,

06:33.741 --> 06:37.440
there's nothing downabout a squash casserole.

06:37.484 --> 06:41.139
There will be once they get
their cholesterol checked.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.449
Hey, shop.

06:46.493 --> 06:47.842
What's up, man?Hey, Calvin.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.234
Hey, Calvin.Hey, Dave.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.236
What's up, Dave?Yo, Dave.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.805
Did you get that thank you noteI sent you for the casserole?

06:56.024 --> 06:57.373
You hear that, Calvin?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.854
He loved it.

06:59.897 --> 07:02.160
And the serving dish it
came in was great, too.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.075
I sold it for ten bucks.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.948
Cool. Cool.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.384
Got that in Peru.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.213
Uh, so, you guys might've heard

07:11.256 --> 07:12.736
that I'm running
for city council.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.782
Yeah, we heard.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.134
I saw one of your signs.I thought it was hilarious.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.918
They drew eye patch, horns,

07:20.962 --> 07:22.746
and I don't want to saywhat you had in your mouth.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.491
Why are youlooking at me?

07:28.535 --> 07:31.320
I just did the eye patchand the horns.

07:32.321 --> 07:33.757
O-Okay.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.280
I-I'm starting to get the vibe

07:35.324 --> 07:37.631
that, uh, some of you
might be skeptical.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.284
But, you know, I've got
some really great ideas

07:39.328 --> 07:41.156
about the neighborhood that I
think might change your minds.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.287
Uh, I got a question.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.899
Great. Fire away.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.944
Was that an Old Bay seasoning
you used in that casserole,

07:46.988 --> 07:48.206
or was it Lawry's?

07:50.295 --> 07:51.906
Any other questions?

07:51.949 --> 07:53.255
Oh, yeah.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.778
That are notabout the casserole.

07:54.822 --> 07:57.085
Oh.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.956
Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.958
Oh, oh, oh!ALL:
Hey.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.004
Councilman.Hey.

08:03.047 --> 08:05.006
I just wanted to drop in
and say hi

08:05.049 --> 08:07.356
to some
of my finest constituents.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.531
And Trey.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.708
You always got jokes,Councilman.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.710
Yeah, and you always got
a court date.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.538
You got him.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.584
Come on.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.673
Wow, so that's
Councilman Evans, huh?

08:19.716 --> 08:21.239
He's really charming.

08:21.283 --> 08:23.067
Yeah, and waittill you feel his handshake.

08:23.111 --> 08:26.506
It's smoother than margarinemelting on a hot roll.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.682
Calvin Butler.

08:28.725 --> 08:31.206
Yeah.Hey. How'sthat beautiful Tina?

08:31.249 --> 08:32.642
Well, she's married to me,

08:32.686 --> 08:34.209
so she's blessed.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.558
Yeah.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.082
Uh, Councilman.
I'm Dave Johnson.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.563
Dave Johnson.The competition.

08:41.651 --> 08:44.741
It is greatto finally meet you.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.222
It is good to meet you, too.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.180
Oh, my God,it's like a buttery hug.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.923
I've been doingmy homework on you,

08:52.967 --> 08:56.100
and it looks like youare ready to run a good race.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.538
Probably in short shorts.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.934
Well, you know, Councilman,
now that you're here, uh,

09:03.978 --> 09:06.371
I have a question
for you.Go right ahead.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.417
Well, I'm just curious on how

09:08.460 --> 09:10.375
you plan on approaching the
shortage of schoolteachers

09:10.419 --> 09:13.335
that our district
is currently facing.

09:13.378 --> 09:14.641
Hmm.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.468
Mmm.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.036
Mm-hmm.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.647
Dave, that is

09:20.690 --> 09:23.040
a very important issue,and I'm glad

09:23.084 --> 09:25.042
you brought that up.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.957
Our teacher shortage

09:27.001 --> 09:29.394
is a real challenge.Yeah. Right on.Yes, sir.

09:29.438 --> 09:32.876
It is a challenge
that we shall meet together

09:32.920 --> 09:35.009
as a community.All right. All right.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.576
And speaking of meeting,

09:36.619 --> 09:39.361
did y'all hear my storyabout how I met Eddie Murphy?

09:42.451 --> 09:43.670
Let Dave in here.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.628
He ain't heard
it yet. Come on.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.499
I was getting my car washed.Okay.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.327
He was getting his car washed.No!

09:49.371 --> 09:52.374
I look over at him.
He looks back at me.What?

09:52.417 --> 09:53.897
He said...

09:53.941 --> 09:55.595
For real!

09:55.638 --> 09:57.597
He... Just like in the movies!

09:57.640 --> 10:00.077
He laughs like in the movies!

10:00.121 --> 10:01.731
I can't believe it.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.604
Councilman Evanstotally dodged my question.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.823
But can you believe

10:06.867 --> 10:10.087
that him and Eddie Murphyboth use cinnamon air freshener?

10:10.131 --> 10:13.003
Wow.

10:13.047 --> 10:15.092
No. Not wow.

10:15.136 --> 10:18.269
If anything deserves a "wow,"
it's my five-point plan.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.097
Each point has five
points of its own.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.446
It's a 25-point plan.

10:21.490 --> 10:24.667
That's 25 wows.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.930
Look, Dave, the bottom line is

10:26.974 --> 10:28.410
to half of the people,

10:28.453 --> 10:30.107
you're the white guywho's new in town.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.501
To the other half,you're the new guy who's white.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.939
Hey. Yo, Dave,

10:35.983 --> 10:38.115
you got some explaining
to do, man.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.203
What are you
talking about?

10:39.247 --> 10:40.814
Isaiah posteda picture of you online,

10:40.857 --> 10:42.685
standing nextto a Confederate flag.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.339
What?Well, that's crazy.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.340
I would never--

10:45.383 --> 10:46.776
Oh. Yeah, that's me.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.045
You better start explaining
why you're in a picture

10:55.089 --> 10:58.266
posing next to a cake
with a Confederate flag on it.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.094
Calvin, you don't understand.

11:00.137 --> 11:03.445
Look, that picture was
from my tenth birthday party.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.055
Well, what'd you do
when you turned 11,

11:05.099 --> 11:06.274
go to a Klan rally?

11:08.755 --> 11:10.713
Isaiah cropped the picture.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.020
Look, the theme of the party
was The Dukes of Hazzard.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.152
That flag is on their car.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.067
I had no idea what it meant.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.721
I'll tell you what it means now.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.984
You can forgetabout being on the city council.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.857
In fact, I wouldn't even get
on a city bus.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.598
This is a disaster.

11:26.642 --> 11:27.861
I'm gonna go talk to Gemma.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.341
Why didn't I havean A-Teamparty?

11:30.385 --> 11:32.735
Everybody loves Mr. T.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.347
Aw, man, I can't
believe this.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.348
I called it.

11:37.392 --> 11:38.741
I knew this would happen.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.004
What? You knew

11:41.048 --> 11:43.615
Isaiah would finda 25-year-old picture

11:43.659 --> 11:46.880
of Dave blowing out the candleson a Confederate flag cake?

11:46.923 --> 11:49.317
Yeah. I just didn't say it
out loud.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.886
Well, we got to help
him clear his name.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.584
How? His name is on the cake.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.892
Dad, Dave is your friend.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.241
You know he's not racist.

12:00.284 --> 12:01.372
I know that.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.070
But what am I supposed to do?

12:03.113 --> 12:06.856
Everyone who's seen that picturealready thinks he is.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.250
Which is exactly why we need
to help him.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.513
Because nobody knows better
than black people

12:11.556 --> 12:14.081
how painful it is to be labeledas something that you're not.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.823
Right, Pop?

12:16.866 --> 12:18.520
Damn it, Malcolm.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.306
Now I got to do the right thing.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.786
And that's on you.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.749
I can't believeIsaiah would do this.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.794
His handshakeisn't like a buttery hug.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.230
It's like a...

12:33.274 --> 12:35.667
Damn it! It islike a buttery hug!

12:37.452 --> 12:39.889
Well, two can play
at this game.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.413
I'm gonna dig up
some dirt on Isaiah

12:42.457 --> 12:44.546
and see how helikes it.What dirt?

12:44.589 --> 12:46.461
Like how he never does anything

12:46.504 --> 12:48.376
or is cheating on his wife

12:48.419 --> 12:50.944
or how he embezzled millions
of dollars from the city.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.728
You found that online?

12:52.772 --> 12:53.903
No, I'm putting it there.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.079
Gemma,

12:56.123 --> 12:58.255
we are not gonna stoop
to his level.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.344
Look, we just have
to face facts.

13:00.388 --> 13:02.259
I'm done.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.913
Don't talk like that.

13:03.957 --> 13:07.351
You have never backed down
from a fight in your life.

13:07.395 --> 13:09.310
Not even when my stripper
cousins jumped you

13:09.353 --> 13:10.615
at Nana's birthday.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.401
Yeah, that was no joke.

13:13.444 --> 13:16.317
Bambi threw glitter
right in my eyes.

13:17.622 --> 13:18.580
Hey, Gemma.

13:18.623 --> 13:19.755
Hey, Dave.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.975
Are you here to say"I told you so"?

13:22.018 --> 13:23.106
I wasn't.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.455
But now that you mention it,

13:24.499 --> 13:25.674
it does feel right, doesn't it?

13:25.717 --> 13:28.503
Well,don't bother.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.505
I think it's pretty obvious thatI have to drop out of the race.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.507
Oh, Calvin,please talk some sense into him.

13:32.550 --> 13:33.943
I'll be upstairs.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.424
You're not gonna go post lies
about Isaiah, are you?

13:36.467 --> 13:38.730
Well, not anymore.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.429
So whatdo you want?

13:42.473 --> 13:43.648
Look,

13:43.692 --> 13:45.955
I know I told you
that you shouldn't run,

13:45.999 --> 13:48.958
but I don't want to see
you go down like this.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.918
If Isaiah's willing to
stoop this low, then,

13:51.961 --> 13:53.833
clearly, we need some
change around here.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.835
Which is why you have my vote.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.924
Unless that line
is too long.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.969
Yeah.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.101
So you're gonna help me?

14:01.144 --> 14:02.319
Yes.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.973
But, first, we
need to find out

14:04.017 --> 14:06.106
if Isaiah has any
more dirt on you.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.498
Like, for Halloween,

14:07.542 --> 14:10.110
did you ever go as a
pointy-headed ghost?

14:15.376 --> 14:16.986
Hi, I'm calling
on behalf

14:17.030 --> 14:20.207
of the Dave Johnson for
City Council campaign--

14:20.250 --> 14:24.385
Oh, well, let me tell you
something about yomama...

14:24.428 --> 14:26.213
Hello?

14:26.256 --> 14:27.475
Okay.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.694
So far, that'sthree "yo mamas..."

14:30.957 --> 14:32.567
...five "go to hells,"

14:32.610 --> 14:34.874
and one "I better not seeyour ass at Chipotle."

14:37.572 --> 14:39.748
Everyone is
so mad at us.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.750
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

14:41.793 --> 14:44.535
And I'm really gonna miss
Chipotle.

14:44.579 --> 14:47.712
Look, I knowthis is bad right now,

14:47.756 --> 14:49.192
but you can get through this.

14:49.236 --> 14:50.280
You're tough.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.195
I'm not so sure.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.719
Well, I am, okay?

14:54.763 --> 14:56.373
You moved your family
into this neighborhood,

14:56.417 --> 14:58.419
and you didn't take mess
from anybody.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.811
I guess.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.031
And you're a principal
at a private school.

15:02.075 --> 15:05.469
You have to deal with snotty,
spoiled brats all day.

15:05.513 --> 15:07.819
And their kids, too.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.649
Half the time, I can't even tellif the moms are mad at me

15:11.693 --> 15:13.173
'cause of all the Botox.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.219
Trust me, girl.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.829
You got this.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.657
Maybe you're right.Mm.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.138
I am kind of a badass B-word.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.010
Mm. Damn straight!

15:24.053 --> 15:27.709
Mm! You are the secondstrongest woman I know.

15:27.752 --> 15:28.928
Who's the first?

15:28.971 --> 15:30.103
Me, B-word!

15:33.280 --> 15:34.890
Okay, Dave,

15:34.934 --> 15:36.500
you sure you're ready for this?

15:36.544 --> 15:38.067
It's gonna getkind of rough in there.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.243
No problem.
I'm just gonna start

15:40.287 --> 15:42.593
by telling them that
there's no way that I'm racist

15:42.637 --> 15:45.901
because my best
friend is black.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.950
As your black best friend,

15:50.993 --> 15:54.779
never say you havea black best friend.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.434
Okay. All right. Well, then
I'm just gonna go in there

15:57.478 --> 16:00.046
and tell them that these
false accusations have got--

16:00.089 --> 16:02.048
have got me
straight trippin'.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.448
I take it back.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.320
I'm not your black best friend.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.279
Okay, so...

16:16.323 --> 16:17.889
Well, what am I
supposed to do?

16:17.933 --> 16:20.980
Look, just go in there andshow them who you really are.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.285
I'll have your back.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.461
Okay. I'm just
gonna go in there

16:24.505 --> 16:25.985
and I'm gonna...

16:26.028 --> 16:28.683
and I'm gonna clap...
back... at my haters.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.949
I never should've shown him
Black Twitter.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.475
Hey, guys! Hey, guys.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.479
What are you doing here?

16:42.523 --> 16:44.829
Yeah. And if you gota casserole,

16:44.873 --> 16:47.919
you drop it offand you leave.

16:50.357 --> 16:53.838
Okay, obviously, everyone
here has seen the picture.

16:53.882 --> 16:57.146
But I swear, you guys, it
is not what it looks like.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.669
Please.

16:58.713 --> 16:59.888
I've used that line before,

16:59.931 --> 17:01.324
and it was
always what it looked like.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.893
All right. Okay,
hold on, everybody.

17:04.936 --> 17:06.677
Come on.Give the man a chance.

17:06.721 --> 17:07.896
A chance to what,

17:07.939 --> 17:09.854
say he's got
a black best friend?

17:11.595 --> 17:15.034
Thank God you talked
to me outside.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.905
Okay, listen up.

17:16.948 --> 17:20.126
Now, I know what everybodyin here is thinking about Dave.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.302
But I've known this manfor two years,

17:22.345 --> 17:24.304
and I can tell you thisfor sure--

17:24.347 --> 17:26.132
there is nota racist bone

17:26.175 --> 17:29.526
in his pasty littlewhite body.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.529
But whatabout the picture?

17:32.573 --> 17:35.532
Look, he was a dumb kidwho watched a dumb TV show.

17:35.576 --> 17:36.664
That doesn't mean

17:36.707 --> 17:38.013
that he was...Wait, wait.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.754
Is that
from The Dukes of Hazzard?

17:39.797 --> 17:41.451
I used to love
that show!

17:43.366 --> 17:45.325
Yeah. It had
that cool theme song.

17:45.368 --> 17:48.023
♪ Just the good ol' boys...

17:48.067 --> 17:50.547
Oh, wait.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.767
See?

17:52.810 --> 17:54.160
You all watched that show.

17:54.203 --> 17:57.119
Which means that Davedidn't do anything wrong.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.121
That's right.
This was just Isaiah trying

17:59.165 --> 18:01.036
to smear my name
so that he could

18:01.080 --> 18:03.821
win... the... election.

18:03.865 --> 18:07.129
I can't believe
Isaiah would stoop that low.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.261
Exactly.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.611
And you all saw him dodgeDave's question.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.179
That's becausehe doesn't have answers.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.310
But Dave does.

18:14.354 --> 18:17.183
He has a 25-point plan that,
trust me,

18:17.226 --> 18:18.793
you do not want to hear.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.970
But i-if you
want to read it,

18:22.013 --> 18:23.363
I have a pamphlet
right here

18:23.406 --> 18:24.799
that has all...

18:26.105 --> 18:28.629
Look, my point is

18:28.672 --> 18:32.546
is that Dave Johnsonis gonna fight for us.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.548
He's gonna makeour schools stronger

18:34.591 --> 18:35.984
and our parks safer,

18:36.027 --> 18:38.552
and he's gonna listento the needs of this community.

18:38.595 --> 18:40.945
And that's why he hasCalvin Butler's support.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.731
Now, come on.Can he count on yours?

18:47.604 --> 18:50.129
Hey, tha-thank you, guys.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.608
And thanks, Calvin.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.610
I don't know how I
can ever repay you.

18:53.654 --> 18:54.829
Well, when you're elected,

18:54.872 --> 18:56.613
you can fix my parking tickets.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.226
I'm gonna pretend that
I didn't hear that.

19:00.269 --> 19:03.011
Should I pretendto say it again?

19:04.665 --> 19:07.102
And, you know,
guys, uh,

19:07.146 --> 19:10.540
just so you know,Isaiah Evans isn't the only one

19:10.584 --> 19:13.761
who has rubbed elbows
with a famous person.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.719
Oh, yeah?Who'd you meet?

19:15.763 --> 19:18.069
Well, a little celebrity chef
named

19:18.113 --> 19:19.723
Paula Deen.Uh-oh.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.856
Come on. We got to go.
We got to go.

19:21.899 --> 19:25.294
Well, where do you think I gotthe recipe for the casserole?

19:31.953 --> 19:33.563
So, you ready
for your lesson?

19:33.607 --> 19:36.218
Yep. Timeto make my handshake

19:36.262 --> 19:39.961
smoother...than... Isaiah's.

19:40.004 --> 19:44.313
You know you don't
actually clap in a clapback?

19:44.357 --> 19:45.923
Well, then, whathave I been doing?

19:45.967 --> 19:47.490
I have no idea.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.058
Look,

19:50.101 --> 19:53.366
now, remember, when it comes
to shaking a man's hand,

19:53.409 --> 19:56.151
you want to be confident
and comforting,

19:56.195 --> 19:58.153
like a warm sock,

19:58.197 --> 19:59.633
fresh from the dryer,

19:59.676 --> 20:01.765
slipping onto his foot.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.854
Check this out.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.682
Hi.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.554
Calvin Butler.
Nice to meet you.

20:07.597 --> 20:08.990
Wow.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.426
I actually believeyou meant that.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.341
Yeah.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.174
Councilman Evans.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
