00:07.061 --> 00:07.993
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.195 --> 00:10.459
So four candidates, including me.

00:10.664 --> 00:13.292
Actually, you make it five.

00:13.501 --> 00:16.231
This hearing aid is expensive.
My insurance won't cover it.

00:16.437 --> 00:18.803
I said that we share everything.
I meant it.

00:19.006 --> 00:20.473
I practice IVs on a mannequin.

00:20.674 --> 00:23.074
That's good.
But know when to ask for help.

00:23.277 --> 00:26.678
I want you to toast
the new Pedes ER Attending. Me.

00:26.881 --> 00:31.716
I have heard of foreign doctors who
were willing to start over as interns.

00:31.919 --> 00:36.253
If they amputate,
is it certain I'll live?

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

00:45.232 --> 00:47.723
It looks like it's stopped two blocks.

00:47.935 --> 00:49.960
- Should we hoof it?
- I don't know.

00:50.171 --> 00:54.005
- Aren't you supposed to set policy?
- I'm here for the ride-along.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.676
- I hate one-way streets.
- This is nothing.

00:56.877 --> 00:59.846
I once responded to a call
from a Metallica concert.

01:00.314 --> 01:04.147
Try getting an anaphylactic headbanger
past "ten thousand maniacs."

01:04.351 --> 01:07.013
The guy dropped some acid.
Started him "counting crows."

01:07.221 --> 01:10.952
I have to live with this. You got
any pull with crew assignments?

01:11.358 --> 01:13.986
Can you get us assigned
to the med team at the Bears game?

01:14.195 --> 01:16.095
I don't do the scheduling, guys.

01:16.297 --> 01:18.424
You were almost my new best friend.

01:19.533 --> 01:22.024
Make way! Paramedics coming through!

01:22.236 --> 01:24.136
Hey, stand back! Stand back!

01:24.338 --> 01:25.498
Give us some room!

01:25.706 --> 01:27.970
Looks like a single...
Whoa! Whoa! Jeez!

01:28.175 --> 01:30.166
- It's Cujo!
- He's protecting his owner.

01:30.678 --> 01:32.976
- Okay, you open the door.
- Sir, can you hear me?

01:33.180 --> 01:35.307
- Is he breathing?
- His chest is moving.

01:35.516 --> 01:37.347
- You got any ideas?
- You're asking me?

01:37.551 --> 01:41.146
- Unit 57 to OCD, over.
- A little puppy Valium?

01:41.355 --> 01:43.186
We need Animal Control to 4th.

01:43.390 --> 01:46.052
A dog is barring access
to an MVA victim. Over.

01:46.260 --> 01:48.194
That'll take too long. Look.

01:48.395 --> 01:50.829
- He's right. We gotta get in.
- What do you suggest?

01:51.031 --> 01:52.794
- I've got a gun.
- I'll keep him busy.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.560
- You're kidding.
- We gotta assess him now.

01:55.769 --> 01:57.168
You're the boss.

01:57.371 --> 01:58.531
Hey, boy!

01:58.973 --> 02:01.533
Ready? One, two...

02:01.742 --> 02:02.970
...three! Hey!

02:03.611 --> 02:06.273
- Got a pulse.
- Good breath sounds. Get a backboard.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.640
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just can't let go.

03:05.973 --> 03:09.704
- When was your last tetanus shot?
- 1992.

03:09.910 --> 03:12.640
- One booster coming right up.
- That's okay, I'll pass.

03:12.846 --> 03:15.906
- It could be worse, like rabies.
- I wouldn't rule it out.

03:16.116 --> 03:18.949
Think we'd notice the difference?

03:19.153 --> 03:22.714
- So how many interviews today?
- Two. You and one other.

03:22.923 --> 03:24.982
You know, I'm still interested...

03:25.192 --> 03:29.686
...but I've decided just not to push
so hard. If I get it, I get it.

03:29.897 --> 03:32.263
- Good idea.
- What do you mean?

03:32.666 --> 03:36.158
I mean it's not a good idea
to get worked up over these things.

03:36.370 --> 03:37.735
- What happened?
- Long story.

03:37.938 --> 03:41.032
- Rachel's sleepover?
- Good guess. Thanks, Kerry.

03:41.241 --> 03:44.938
- What's going on?
- Graffiti guys went crazy last night.

03:45.212 --> 03:47.874
- You're on?
- I'm getting set up for tomorrow.

03:48.082 --> 03:49.413
Color-coordinated charts?

03:49.616 --> 03:52.084
Well, whoever said Doug Ross
isn't organized?

03:52.286 --> 03:54.379
- I did.
- Take it easy.

03:54.588 --> 03:57.989
Hey, Mark, don't Attendings pay
for Nurse's Night?

03:58.192 --> 03:59.819
Yeah. Now Doug can contribute.

04:00.027 --> 04:01.551
No, that's the ER.
I'm the Pedes ER.

04:01.762 --> 04:04.754
Well, Pedes needs nurses, right?
So I'm billing.

04:05.299 --> 04:08.359
Hey, get this, 19-year-old,
third pregnancy...

04:08.569 --> 04:10.594
...says she doesn't know
how to use a condom.

04:10.804 --> 04:12.897
- So did you teach her?
- We're way past that.

04:13.107 --> 04:15.507
- I'm talking her into a Norplant.
- Are you sure?

04:15.709 --> 04:17.370
I'd tie her tubes myself if I could.

04:17.577 --> 04:19.773
If the drawbridge is up,
you can't storm the castle.

04:19.980 --> 04:22.072
- Excuse me?
- Try a diaphragm. They work.

04:22.282 --> 04:25.445
Oh, yeah? I wouldn't be too sure.
I'm three days late.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.914
What? What?

04:28.122 --> 04:30.590
These came from upstairs.
Letters of rec for chief.

04:30.791 --> 04:32.656
- Thank you.
- Okay, lift your sleeve.

04:32.860 --> 04:35.055
When did someone get tetanus
from a dog?

04:35.262 --> 04:36.388
Don't be a baby.

04:36.597 --> 04:38.656
- Nice suit, Dr. Weaver.
- Thank you.

04:38.832 --> 04:40.959
- I didn't know you read <i>Cosmo.</i>
- Excuse me?

04:41.168 --> 04:43.159
Last month's article
on the power suit.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.036
I guess I missed that one.

04:47.174 --> 04:48.471
Are you sure?

04:48.675 --> 04:51.337
I mean, you nailed it,
down to the accessories.

04:53.247 --> 04:55.909
- So how long have you been on?
- Oh, just now.

04:56.650 --> 04:59.949
- Who's your Resident?
- I suppose I'll find out in a minute.

05:00.154 --> 05:03.055
Why? Did you vie for me?

05:03.424 --> 05:05.551
You're too much for me to handle.

05:06.326 --> 05:08.760
Hopefully, whoever I get
feels the same way.

05:08.962 --> 05:12.830
No, I suspect I'll be sidelined
as a consultant more than anything.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.294
Hey, do me a favor.

05:14.501 --> 05:16.526
Reach in his bag and hand me
his hearing aid.

05:16.737 --> 05:18.329
It's in the black case.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.375
- Is he having trouble with these?
- No.

05:22.576 --> 05:26.569
- So why are you putting them on now?
- I was running late.

05:26.780 --> 05:30.147
- Peter, have you not told everyone?
- Told who?

05:31.151 --> 05:35.349
I don't have time for a whole bunch
of repetitive questions and sympathy.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.856
Are you sure that's it?

05:38.725 --> 05:41.558
- My son is deaf. I know that, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

05:42.830 --> 05:44.092
Wish me luck.

05:45.499 --> 05:49.094
Jeff Whitcher, 38-year-old magician,
inhaled flash powder.

05:49.303 --> 05:51.999
What happened? Trap door didn't open?

05:52.206 --> 05:53.332
More complicated.

05:53.540 --> 05:57.067
Short of breath and tachypneic,
respiratory rate is 28.

05:57.277 --> 05:59.302
No previous history
of respiratory illness...

05:59.513 --> 06:01.606
...or inhalation of toxic substances.

06:01.815 --> 06:04.511
- What's in flash powder?
- Sorry. Trade secret.

06:04.718 --> 06:08.984
Lycopodium with potassium nitrate.
I looked it up on the Internet.

06:09.590 --> 06:13.686
Pulse ox is borderline, 91.
No cyanosis.

06:13.894 --> 06:16.385
- Are you a smoker?
- Occasional.

06:16.597 --> 06:18.497
Occupational hazard.

06:18.699 --> 06:21.463
- You can't smoke that here!
- I wasn't planning to.

06:23.537 --> 06:26.506
- What do you want to do?
- Get a blood gas and check a PO2.

06:26.707 --> 06:28.231
You get to learn a new procedure.

06:28.842 --> 06:30.833
I happen to have
a blood gas kit here.

06:31.044 --> 06:33.604
- Hey, pretty good, doc.
- Trade secret.

06:33.814 --> 06:35.975
- Can you get a cup of ice, please?
- Sure.

06:36.183 --> 06:38.913
- We're out of gloves.
- Try your pocket.

06:41.388 --> 06:42.650
How did you do that?

06:42.856 --> 06:45.723
It's not what they see,
it's what they think they see.

06:46.326 --> 06:48.351
- You didn't even move.
- Lucy.

06:48.562 --> 06:52.692
The blood gas. This one you watch.
Next one you do.

06:53.567 --> 06:55.501
Don't panic. It's a couple of days.

06:55.702 --> 06:58.227
- You said three days.
- Two, three, whatever.

06:58.438 --> 07:00.463
You said you were regular
as a Swiss watch.

07:00.674 --> 07:02.574
Yeah. I'm regular, not a machine.

07:02.776 --> 07:04.368
You gonna do a pregnancy test?

07:04.578 --> 07:07.172
- You're really sweating this.
- Aren't you? A little?

07:07.381 --> 07:10.282
- I don't feel pregnant.
- Have you been pregnant before?

07:10.484 --> 07:12.111
I shouldn't have said anything.

07:16.190 --> 07:18.124
- What's up?
- Syncope. Fourth episode.

07:18.325 --> 07:20.293
- Seizure?
- I don't think so.

07:20.494 --> 07:22.587
You want to use the Pedes room?
No waiting.

07:22.829 --> 07:25.320
Here we go. Okay.
Hey, what's this? Hey!

07:25.532 --> 07:26.897
Could be Carter's.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.763
- Carter! Is this your body in here?
- Yeah, sorry.

07:30.971 --> 07:33.462
- Transport's slow. Need the room?
- Yeah.

07:33.674 --> 07:34.834
Give me a hand.

07:37.244 --> 07:40.941
- I thought the Pedes ER was closed.
- Don't leave your stiffs in here.

07:41.148 --> 07:42.137
Take him to the morgue.

07:42.349 --> 07:44.715
We've been waiting on a transfer
for hours.

07:44.918 --> 07:46.818
- This "the" Prince Albert?
- Who?

07:47.020 --> 07:49.011
His ding-dong's pierced.
He has a diamond.

07:49.223 --> 07:50.520
A diamond in his penis?

07:50.724 --> 07:52.316
Haleh said it was tricky getting
in the Foley.

07:52.526 --> 07:54.323
- Want to peek?
- I've seen one.

07:54.528 --> 07:56.223
- I bet.
- Hey, watch it.

07:59.499 --> 08:02.297
It's your lucky day.
It seems I'm your intern.

08:02.502 --> 08:04.936
- You missed rounds.
- It's the first day.

08:05.138 --> 08:07.106
I wasn't sure how this would work.

08:07.307 --> 08:09.366
You need to be here at 5 a.m. Sharp.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.703
I hope you don't expect
special treatment.

08:11.912 --> 08:15.939
I don't know what you've been told.
This is more of a formality.

08:16.149 --> 08:18.515
Maybe for you.
You're the only intern I have.

08:18.719 --> 08:21.745
Finish pre-rounding before 6.
I need all the vitals.

08:21.955 --> 08:24.321
T-max, mental status, I's and O's.

08:24.524 --> 08:28.016
After rounds, check the labs
and run down all x-rays.

08:28.228 --> 08:31.095
Go over the x-rays yourself.
Don't trust the radiologist.

08:31.298 --> 08:35.097
Buff the electrolytes as needed.
You take all floor calls.

08:35.302 --> 08:37.532
If we have clinic that day,
you do H and P's.

08:37.738 --> 08:42.140
And, of course, all pre-op orders:
CBC, lytes, UA, EKG, PT.

08:42.342 --> 08:44.572
I know how to pre-op a patient,
thank you.

08:44.778 --> 08:48.339
Good. If surgery's canceled
because you miss a lab, it's your ass.

08:48.548 --> 08:50.413
We'll start with Mr. Anderson.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.948
I reduced his O2.

08:52.152 --> 08:54.643
Redraw an ABG in 30 minutes.

08:54.855 --> 08:58.586
Monitor urine output Q one hour.

08:58.792 --> 09:00.589
Advance drains on beds three and five.

09:00.794 --> 09:03.592
One, two and six need
wet-to-dry dressing changes.

09:03.797 --> 09:05.230
You're serious?

09:05.432 --> 09:08.731
This is how it works.
As third-year, I'm busy operating.

09:09.136 --> 09:12.594
This stuff is not my job. But the
scut has to be done, by an intern.

09:12.806 --> 09:16.469
I have three cases today. If you
finish, you can scrub in for one.

09:16.677 --> 09:18.201
Oh, and this is for you.

09:18.578 --> 09:20.876
Interns wear short coats.

09:38.098 --> 09:40.726
Hold the elevator! Hold it!

09:42.235 --> 09:46.001
- Are you all right?
- I said, hold the elevator!

09:51.244 --> 09:52.233
Where are we?

09:52.446 --> 09:54.744
We got multiple stab wounds
to the extremities.

09:54.948 --> 09:56.643
One in the forearm and chest.

09:56.850 --> 09:59.546
BP's 120/75. Pulse ox 99.

09:59.753 --> 10:02.051
- Did the guy have friends?
- Lungs are clear.

10:02.255 --> 10:04.280
Four plus right radial
and ulnar pulses.

10:04.491 --> 10:06.482
- What's your name?
- Bo.

10:06.693 --> 10:07.990
Bo, we'll take care of you.

10:08.195 --> 10:10.891
You're very lucky.
The chest wound is superficial.

10:11.098 --> 10:13.089
Bo, do this with your hand.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.961
How about a car, Bo?

10:15.168 --> 10:17.659
Spread your fingers.
Don't let me close them.

10:17.871 --> 10:20.203
I'm tired of this game.
Tell me who it was.

10:20.407 --> 10:22.807
- Does he have to be here?
- Can you wait outside?

10:23.009 --> 10:25.705
You were stabbed in daylight.
You didn't see anything?

10:25.912 --> 10:27.903
You know what? Wait outside.

10:28.615 --> 10:30.242
Okay, let's roll him.

10:30.684 --> 10:34.484
- He'll try to settle this on his own.
- Now we have to treat him.

10:34.688 --> 10:37.452
You know what? Forget it.
Have it your way.

10:38.492 --> 10:40.483
You could've pressed
that hold button.

10:41.495 --> 10:43.793
Damn, these elevators are slow.

10:44.765 --> 10:47.757
I'm gonna catch that lunch traffic.
I know it!

10:47.968 --> 10:49.959
- Do you drive?
- Do I?

10:51.872 --> 10:55.308
My son used to have one of those.
Gave him a heart attack.

10:55.509 --> 10:56.498
Nothing but stress.

10:56.710 --> 10:57.836
Come on, come on.

11:08.722 --> 11:12.283
No, I didn't watch the whole thing.
The part I saw looked benign.

11:12.492 --> 11:14.551
It was my fault. Sorry.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.093
- Well, you did. Thanks.
- Problem?

11:17.297 --> 11:19.731
Did you know that <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
is PG-13?

11:19.933 --> 11:21.423
- I wasn't aware of it.
- It is.

11:21.635 --> 11:25.696
I showed it at Rachel's slumber party.
Now all the mothers are calling me.

11:26.673 --> 11:29.005
Elizabeth. Elizabeth!

11:30.677 --> 11:32.941
Can you come take a look
at a pulseless foot?

11:33.146 --> 11:35.546
I've been waiting 40 minutes
for a surgical consult.

11:35.749 --> 11:38.115
Normally, I would.
But I'm only an intern.

11:38.318 --> 11:39.649
I can't believe it.

11:39.853 --> 11:42.981
I don't want to believe it.
I already have five admissions.

11:43.190 --> 11:44.623
Lab turnaround time is pathetic.

11:44.825 --> 11:47.555
And Radiology already lost
three of my films.

11:47.761 --> 11:49.592
Dale has me sitting
for a bleeding time...

11:49.796 --> 11:52.959
...on your Ewing's sarcoma amputation.
Waste of time.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.999
- Dana Ellis?
- She doesn't have a clotting problem.

11:56.203 --> 11:58.501
- Is that today?
- Yes, surgery's at 4 p.m.

11:58.705 --> 12:02.197
Five minutes. 54-year-old male,
peripheral vascular disease...

12:02.409 --> 12:05.344
...calf pain at rest.
I'm thinking arterial thrombosis.

12:05.545 --> 12:07.172
- Did you get a Doppler pulse?
- Yeah.

12:07.380 --> 12:09.871
Mr. Darcy, this is Dr. Corday,
our Surgical Resident.

12:10.083 --> 12:14.042
How long will this keep me down?
I choreograph a video next week.

12:14.254 --> 12:16.950
Let me examine you,
and I'll have a clearer idea.

12:17.157 --> 12:19.785
- Are you a smoker?
- What's that got to do with my leg?

12:19.993 --> 12:22.655
- Is this the Vascular consult?
- I asked Dr. Corday to examine.

12:22.863 --> 12:23.921
I'll take over.

12:24.130 --> 12:25.791
Did you get the labs
on the perfed diverticulum?

12:25.999 --> 12:27.398
They're not ready yet.

12:27.601 --> 12:30.798
Better sit on them.
You know Romano. Gotta start on time.

12:31.004 --> 12:32.369
Of course.

12:40.881 --> 12:41.973
Come on.

12:42.182 --> 12:43.479
- Lucy?
- What?!

12:43.683 --> 12:44.911
- Is something wrong?
- No.

12:45.118 --> 12:47.586
Can you work up
this guy with vertigo for me?

12:47.787 --> 12:50.756
You know how to check
for cerebellar function?

12:50.957 --> 12:54.051
Find me when you're done.
We'll discuss the differential.

12:54.261 --> 12:55.387
Got it.

12:57.731 --> 13:01.531
- What's the extension for the morgue?
- 5001. See this guy?

13:01.735 --> 13:03.430
He's looking for Dr. Carter.

13:07.774 --> 13:10.800
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. My brother died last night.

13:11.011 --> 13:12.979
They gave me his valuables.
But something's missing.

13:13.179 --> 13:17.741
- I need to get some jewelry off him.
- Oh, right! Right!

13:17.951 --> 13:21.114
- Your brother's down in the morgue.
- Last name Naughton?

13:21.321 --> 13:23.050
Definitely down in the morgue.

13:24.357 --> 13:26.723
- Can you tell me how to get there?
- Yeah. No.

13:26.927 --> 13:29.760
They don't allow family down there.

13:29.963 --> 13:34.593
It's... They make you wait.
It takes forever.

13:34.801 --> 13:35.859
It's chilly.

13:36.069 --> 13:37.366
You know what I'm gonna do?

13:37.571 --> 13:39.539
I'm gonna go down there and get it.

13:39.739 --> 13:42.503
Your brother. And bring
your brother up here.

13:43.243 --> 13:46.076
- Great. That'd be great. Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

13:49.716 --> 13:52.276
- What are you doing here?
- Checking in on you.

13:52.485 --> 13:53.782
How you feeling?

13:55.255 --> 13:58.588
Well, they're chopping my leg off.

13:58.792 --> 14:01.283
- Your decision?
- You could call it that.

14:01.494 --> 14:04.463
I wouldn't have had a say at all
if it wasn't for you.

14:05.198 --> 14:08.861
You gotta go with the odds, right?
You scared?

14:09.669 --> 14:14.663
I thought, "Okay, I'll just
get used to it." But...

14:19.212 --> 14:20.338
In pain?

14:21.481 --> 14:22.641
A little.

14:23.917 --> 14:25.908
I'll tell them
to increase the dosage.

14:26.119 --> 14:29.782
That's okay.
I sort of like to feel it.

14:29.990 --> 14:31.787
It'll be gone in a few hours.

14:34.094 --> 14:35.686
- Hello, Mr. Ellis.
- What's going on?

14:35.895 --> 14:37.624
I came to check in on Dana.

14:37.831 --> 14:40.026
She's being taken care of. Thank you.

14:41.267 --> 14:43.201
I wanted to talk to you
about her pain.

14:43.403 --> 14:46.031
Dana's having surgery in a few hours.

14:46.239 --> 14:49.731
If you don't mind, Dr. Romano is gonna
handle everything from here.

14:50.944 --> 14:51.933
Okay.

14:56.916 --> 14:59.384
Excuse me.
Are you in charge of transport?

14:59.586 --> 15:01.486
Depends who's asking.

15:01.688 --> 15:03.315
I know this sounds weird.

15:03.523 --> 15:06.390
I was wondering if you
by any chance found a body?

15:07.794 --> 15:09.125
Transport!

15:09.663 --> 15:12.131
Yeah, what floor? Okay.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.197
I don't know. Half-hour.

15:16.636 --> 15:17.830
Damn!

15:18.505 --> 15:20.405
- What did you want?
- I lost a body.

15:20.607 --> 15:23.872
- Did you try to move it yourself?
- You guys were taking so long.

15:24.077 --> 15:25.601
- What was I supposed to do?
- It's our fault?

15:25.812 --> 15:29.441
No, it's not your fault.
I just want to find the body.

15:29.649 --> 15:30.911
I'll call the morgue.

15:31.117 --> 15:33.381
- I checked. He's not there.
- Yo, Gerald!

15:33.987 --> 15:35.511
Yo, it's Tony.

15:35.989 --> 15:37.354
Have any unclaimed bodies?

15:39.492 --> 15:41.084
Yeah, she's here now.

15:42.462 --> 15:46.159
Hold on, I'll ask. Would this body
fit down the incinerator chute?

15:46.433 --> 15:47.661
The incinerator?!

15:48.001 --> 15:49.161
Yeah, that got her.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.163
Yo, thanks, G.
Okay, I'll be right down.

15:53.039 --> 15:57.135
You're in luck. Someone stuffed some
fat stiff in the closet of the ICU.

15:58.311 --> 16:00.802
Why? Why do you have to go?

16:01.014 --> 16:01.878
I just gotta.

16:02.082 --> 16:03.447
Well, what's the hurry?

16:04.217 --> 16:05.241
The doctor said it's okay.

16:05.452 --> 16:09.081
Well, it will be okay.
He has to stitch it up first.

16:09.289 --> 16:10.813
Besides, I like having you around.

16:11.024 --> 16:14.016
There's not very many interesting
people here today.

16:14.227 --> 16:16.991
So maybe I'll come back.

16:17.497 --> 16:20.295
You've gotta help me out.
You'll get me in trouble.

16:21.468 --> 16:22.457
I'll write you a note.

16:23.269 --> 16:26.067
Besides, you do not want
to get that infected.

16:26.906 --> 16:30.307
Just a few minutes. I'll get
a doctor. We'll take care of it.

16:31.845 --> 16:33.745
- All right.
- Good.

16:38.384 --> 16:39.408
- Lynette?
- Yeah?

16:39.619 --> 16:42.110
- Could you get his mother for me?
- He's 18.

16:42.322 --> 16:45.485
He got stabbed. I'm afraid
he'll bolt to settle the score.

16:45.692 --> 16:47.626
- Mark!
- Yeah. Hold on a minute.

16:47.827 --> 16:50.887
- You admitting that thrombosis?
- He's got a high-grade lesion.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.588
- You taking him up?
- I need to present him to Romano.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.824
Then we'll bring the team.

16:55.034 --> 16:56.501
- When?
- As soon as I can.

16:56.703 --> 16:58.398
Can you stitch Bo? He's antsy.

16:58.605 --> 17:00.232
I'll be right there.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.000
Can you clear this neck for me?
He looks okay.

17:03.209 --> 17:05.143
I ordered a trauma panel.

17:05.345 --> 17:07.472
- Sure. You got it.
- Thank you.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.875
- How are we doing?
- Vitals are normal.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.071
I'm fine.

17:11.284 --> 17:14.310
- Did you lose consciousness?
- No.

17:14.521 --> 17:16.318
This really isn't necessary.

17:16.522 --> 17:18.752
- Any chest or abdominal pain?
- Can I go home?

17:18.958 --> 17:21.358
We need to get an x-ray
of your neck first.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.961
- Have you ever had hepatitis?
- I don't think so. Why?

17:24.164 --> 17:26.859
Your eyes are a little yellow.
On any medication?

17:27.066 --> 17:31.002
- Prednisone, cyclosporine, Imuran.
- Those are transplant meds.

17:31.237 --> 17:34.104
Well, I had a new liver two years ago.

17:34.307 --> 17:37.470
Okay. Let's get a ProTime,
LFTs and a cyclosporine level.

17:37.677 --> 17:40.407
- Something's wrong?
- Doctor! Doctor!

17:40.613 --> 17:42.080
One minute. You're jaundiced.

17:42.282 --> 17:45.217
- I can go see my doctor.
- We need to do those tests now.

17:45.418 --> 17:46.612
I'll be back.

17:54.093 --> 17:55.958
- Here you go, Jeanie.
- Thanks.

17:59.899 --> 18:03.391
- This is her card.
- Rosa Munoz.

18:03.603 --> 18:05.127
That's social security card.

18:05.338 --> 18:06.669
She said her name was Carmen.

18:09.676 --> 18:11.940
- And your name?
- Luisa.

18:12.145 --> 18:14.807
- Her sister?
- Cousins.

18:15.748 --> 18:17.511
I understand you're concerned.

18:17.717 --> 18:20.117
This would be fraud.
It doesn't matter if he's illegal.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.753
No, that's her number.

18:21.955 --> 18:23.946
- This is your card.
- No.

18:28.061 --> 18:30.427
She say that he need a special doctor?

18:30.630 --> 18:33.098
There could be a problem
with Angel's heart.

18:33.933 --> 18:36.595
Please take this number.
Other hospital no take him...

18:36.803 --> 18:39.931
We're a county hospital.
We treat all emergencies.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.505
- True?
- True.

18:42.942 --> 18:46.002
When we're short on beds, we
stick the bodies in the storage room.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.941
- Why didn't you call us?
- We did.

18:48.147 --> 18:52.140
- Guys, I gotta get back.
- You want to take him back?

18:52.352 --> 18:55.116
- He's black.
- Is that a problem?

18:56.055 --> 18:57.545
Dana Ellis. What about her?

18:57.757 --> 19:00.920
- I'm worried about phantom limb pain.
- Don't be. She's on morphine.

19:01.127 --> 19:03.322
That won't do it. I want her
on a preemptive analgesia...

19:03.529 --> 19:05.224
...to rewire the motor nerves.

19:06.432 --> 19:08.161
She's still your patient?

19:08.368 --> 19:12.236
Dr. Greene's on line 3, waiting
on a consult for an ischemic leg.

19:12.438 --> 19:14.463
- Does he have a pulse by Doppler?
- I'll check.

19:14.674 --> 19:16.232
It's a simple lumbar epidural.

19:16.442 --> 19:18.000
It'll put the surgery off a few days.

19:18.211 --> 19:22.671
One night course does not
a pain management specialist make.

19:22.882 --> 19:25.510
The patient has a Doppler pulse.
Dr. Greene wants an ETA.

19:25.718 --> 19:27.845
- When I get there!
- There's no reason not to try.

19:28.054 --> 19:30.852
I don't know that she's
psychologically ready.

19:31.057 --> 19:32.718
Three days won't make much difference.

19:32.926 --> 19:36.259
- How's that new intern working out?
- She'll get the hang of it.

19:36.462 --> 19:37.520
Let her scrub in.

19:37.730 --> 19:39.891
- I'm gonna talk to the family.
- No, you're not!

19:40.099 --> 19:42.465
That girl has a cancer
that could spread very rapidly.

19:42.669 --> 19:46.799
I won't sit idly by and watch you
experiment with a technique you read!

19:47.006 --> 19:48.974
- Dr. Romano?
- What?!

19:49.175 --> 19:52.144
You should talk to Greene.
He wants something definitive.

19:52.345 --> 19:55.041
If the guy has calf pain, tell him
to do an ultrasound. Don't go!

19:55.248 --> 19:58.376
Rule out DVT. That'll shut him up.
Leave it alone!

20:00.920 --> 20:03.150
I have to go upstairs
to this interview.

20:03.356 --> 20:06.519
Will you page me when Romano
graces us with his presence?

20:06.726 --> 20:07.715
Don't hold your breath.

20:07.894 --> 20:09.327
You'll tear your stitches!

20:09.529 --> 20:10.928
Let me out! I gotta go!

20:11.130 --> 20:13.030
So you can get the guy that did this?

20:13.232 --> 20:15.894
- What's going on?
- Bo here wants to retaliate.

20:16.102 --> 20:18.070
You said the doc would stitch me up
and I could go.

20:18.271 --> 20:20.705
- We want you to be safe, Bo.
- Save it, lady.

20:20.907 --> 20:23.102
Look, thanks for fixing me!
I'm going.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.243
If you want me to sign, I'll sign.

20:25.445 --> 20:28.539
You'll rip your vein open.
I don't want you bleeding.

20:28.748 --> 20:31.911
- Then take it out.
- You want to leave that bad, fine.

20:32.118 --> 20:33.847
Let me get the right instrument.

20:34.053 --> 20:35.987
You can go about your business.

20:37.490 --> 20:41.153
Please, wait here. Wait one minute.
I'll be right back.

20:44.030 --> 20:46.157
- What's going on?
- He can't leave.

20:46.366 --> 20:48.561
- When's the mother getting here?
- I haven't reached her.

20:48.768 --> 20:50.929
- I'm calling Psych.
- He'll be gone by then.

20:53.306 --> 20:54.967
- What is that?
- Versed.

20:55.174 --> 20:57.438
I have to sedate him
until the mother gets here.

20:59.045 --> 21:01.570
That might be an option
if it wasn't unethical.

21:01.781 --> 21:05.740
- Not with someone's life at stake.
- You can't restrain him with drugs.

21:06.452 --> 21:09.853
He was agitated. To finish
the treatment, we had to sedate him.

21:10.423 --> 21:13.915
Security can keep him down here
until Psych puts him on a hold.

21:14.127 --> 21:16.755
They'll have to prove
that he's a danger to others.

21:16.963 --> 21:19.864
- He knows the system. He'll lie.
- Maybe we'll find his mother.

21:20.767 --> 21:22.758
- I'm gonna make sure.
- Not with that.

21:24.437 --> 21:27.065
- You have a better idea?
- I'll handle it.

21:28.341 --> 21:29.865
You know what he'll do if you don't.

21:32.445 --> 21:35.312
I understand your motive.
I know I asked for your help.

21:35.815 --> 21:39.808
Why don't you stick with the clinic
patients? Leave the ER ones to me.

21:40.820 --> 21:41.809
Good luck.

21:45.725 --> 21:48.023
It don't matter what I do.
It's my business.

21:48.227 --> 21:50.593
I don't want you here again,
maybe dead.

21:50.797 --> 21:54.426
If it goes down like that, it does.
Wouldn't be the first time.

21:54.634 --> 21:56.033
You don't mean that.

21:57.737 --> 22:00.001
Yo, what's the rent-a-cop doing here?

22:00.206 --> 22:02.071
So you can talk to somebody.

22:02.275 --> 22:04.436
- I trusted you!
- I'm trying to help you.

22:04.644 --> 22:06.509
Save it! I ain't talking to nobody.

22:06.712 --> 22:08.771
We'll wait until your mom gets here.

22:08.981 --> 22:12.917
- My mom? You called my mom?
- I'll be right back.

22:13.786 --> 22:15.378
Don't let him leave.

22:17.490 --> 22:20.789
Pay attention, Dale. Peter's one
of our fastest colon dissectors...

22:20.993 --> 22:22.893
...now that Lizzie's gun's
in the holster.

22:23.096 --> 22:26.964
We've got an open abdomen, people.
Let's turn up the heat, please.

22:27.166 --> 22:30.761
Elizabeth, would you retract
the descending colon?

22:30.970 --> 22:32.232
My pleasure.

22:32.839 --> 22:36.673
Actually, Dale, why don't you retract
and bovie and give Lizzie the sucker?

22:37.076 --> 22:40.307
Right. Lizzie, suck out
this oozing area, would you?

22:40.513 --> 22:42.981
If you don't mind, I don't care
for being called Lizzie.

22:43.182 --> 22:45.013
Really? Dr. Romano calls you that.

22:45.218 --> 22:50.087
- Dale, what structure am I dissecting?
- Ilioinguinal nerve.

22:51.891 --> 22:53.654
Elizabeth, would you help him out?

22:53.926 --> 22:57.157
Owing to the slight peristalsis,
it's obviously the left ureter.

22:57.363 --> 22:59.627
Better get faster
with that suction, Lizzie.

22:59.832 --> 23:00.992
I freed the sigmoid.

23:01.200 --> 23:05.534
Elizabeth, ligate the proximal
side while I clamp the vessels.

23:05.738 --> 23:08.707
- Certainly.
- Dale, move over and start irrigating.

23:08.908 --> 23:10.773
I prefer Dale do any ligating.

23:10.977 --> 23:13.775
Just as soon as we finish
the mesenteric vessels.

23:13.980 --> 23:17.438
Sorry to bother you, Dr. Romano.
Dr. Greene is calling again.

23:17.650 --> 23:19.811
Lizzie, I think you
just contaminated yourself.

23:20.019 --> 23:22.317
- I did not.
- Better be safe. Change gowns.

23:22.522 --> 23:24.990
- I didn't contaminate myself.
- I saw it. She's clean.

23:25.191 --> 23:26.783
- Thank you.
- So don't pick on her.

23:28.661 --> 23:31.494
Lizzie, scrub out
and go pacify Greene, would you?

23:40.540 --> 23:42.201
- You're still here?
- Yeah.

23:42.408 --> 23:45.866
You're putting a lot of effort into
this Pedes ER. I'll give you that.

23:46.078 --> 23:47.875
- I'll take it.
- Hey, guys.

23:48.080 --> 23:51.641
This is our new Pedes ER Attending
and full-time delivery boy, Doug Ross.

23:51.851 --> 23:53.819
- What do you got for us?
- You're cut off.

23:54.020 --> 23:55.681
This is Claudia Olson.

23:55.888 --> 23:58.686
She's a candidate for the new
Chief of Emergency Medicine.

23:58.891 --> 23:59.858
- A masochist?
- Yeah.

24:00.059 --> 24:01.219
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

24:01.427 --> 24:03.156
- Kerry Weaver.
- The Interim Chief?

24:03.362 --> 24:05.353
Yeah. It's nice to meet you.

24:05.565 --> 24:07.430
You're interviewing today as well?

24:07.633 --> 24:08.998
How did you guess?

24:09.202 --> 24:12.763
Well, at least I got to go first.
It was nice to meet you.

24:12.972 --> 24:14.200
You too.

24:15.408 --> 24:16.773
<i>It could be hepatitis.</i>

24:16.976 --> 24:19.740
But our major concern is
that you're rejecting the liver.

24:19.946 --> 24:22.380
Well, I feel fine. A little tired.

24:22.582 --> 24:24.573
Do you ever forget to take your meds?

24:24.784 --> 24:26.513
No. I set my watch daily.

24:26.719 --> 24:29.745
My cyclosporine level's therapeutic,
isn't it?

24:29.956 --> 24:32.049
We should arrange for a liver biopsy.

24:33.059 --> 24:36.859
If it's all the same to you,
I would rather see my own doctor.

24:37.597 --> 24:41.055
I understand. He hasn't said
anything about your abnormal LFTs?

24:41.867 --> 24:44.062
I got busy, missed a couple
of checkups.

24:44.937 --> 24:48.429
You know how important follow-ups
are after organ transplantation.

24:51.944 --> 24:55.277
I think part of me always suspected
but didn't want to know for sure.

24:58.150 --> 24:59.139
Now I do.

25:00.219 --> 25:02.244
You can put yourself
on the UNOS list again.

25:02.722 --> 25:04.986
I don't think so.
It's the second time around.

25:05.191 --> 25:08.422
You qualified the first time.
You could get lucky again.

25:09.528 --> 25:12.258
- Do you have the Munoz kid?
- I do, yes.

25:12.465 --> 25:14.933
Excuse me one more time. Excuse me.

25:15.701 --> 25:18.067
- Is it cardiomyopathy?
- He needs a full EP workup.

25:18.271 --> 25:19.636
Did he have an ectopy?

25:19.839 --> 25:21.864
The echo ruled out
an outlet obstruction.

25:22.074 --> 25:23.336
The cause of his fainting?

25:23.542 --> 25:25.169
- It's probably arrhythmia.
- Arrhythmia.

25:25.378 --> 25:27.869
I'm going to try to induce it
in a cath lab.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.106
If so, he'll need an internal
cardioverter defibrillator.

25:31.317 --> 25:33.717
- I'm glad we caught it.
- I'll call the surgeon.

25:33.919 --> 25:35.648
- Can you get consent?
- Sure. Thank you.

25:35.855 --> 25:38.085
Don't thank me. The kid needs it.

25:48.834 --> 25:51.496
- It's about time. Where's Romano?
- Just me, I'm afraid.

25:51.704 --> 25:52.864
So can you admit him?

25:53.072 --> 25:55.131
Based on my responsibilities,
I'd say no.

25:55.341 --> 25:58.071
- So you're here to stall me.
- Something like that.

25:58.277 --> 26:01.303
I'll pass him through Radiology.
He needs an angiogram.

26:01.514 --> 26:03.505
But tell Romano you only bought
him 20 minutes.

26:03.749 --> 26:06.809
Don't leave him long. Radiologists
have a way of snatching...

26:07.019 --> 26:09.385
...the procedures if the surgeons
are slow on the uptake.

26:09.588 --> 26:11.249
Noted. Thank you. Jeanie.

26:11.457 --> 26:13.186
- Here's the BA on your MVA.
- On who?

26:13.392 --> 26:15.553
- Lipson, Trauma 2.
- I didn't order a BA.

26:15.761 --> 26:19.356
I did. It's part of the trauma panel.
Randi put it in my box.

26:19.565 --> 26:21.590
- Something wrong?
- Blood alcohol's.04.

26:21.801 --> 26:24.292
- That's below the limit.
- It means he drinks.

26:24.503 --> 26:26.903
I finished my write-up on the vertigo.

26:27.106 --> 26:30.007
- And I got you coffee.
- You don't need to do that.

26:30.209 --> 26:32.507
I was in the cafeteria looking
for something.

26:32.712 --> 26:33.940
All right, thanks.

26:34.146 --> 26:37.912
Why don't you start the IV on the
4-year-old with the gastroenteritis.

26:38.117 --> 26:40.779
300 cc bolus of saline.
Be careful, she's dehydrated.

26:40.986 --> 26:42.715
- Could be tricky.
- Right.

26:42.922 --> 26:46.358
- Thanks a lot. I feel so much better.
- Glad to hear it.

26:46.559 --> 26:49.653
Call me if you'd like
some free tickets to my show.

26:49.895 --> 26:53.558
- Are you okay?
- How'd that get there?

26:53.766 --> 26:57.293
There you go. I didn't want
things disappearing on you.

26:57.503 --> 26:59.801
Hey, you haven't by any chance
seen a body...

27:04.477 --> 27:06.468
Carol, could you help me start an IV?

27:06.679 --> 27:08.306
She's dehydrated.
I don't want to hurt her.

27:08.514 --> 27:10.072
- Have you tried?
- Not yet.

27:10.282 --> 27:13.115
- So you haven't even started an IV?
- Honestly, no.

27:13.319 --> 27:15.685
This is ridiculous.
Everyone thinks you can.

27:15.888 --> 27:19.324
- I'll talk to Dr. Carter today.
- Lf you don't, I will.

27:19.525 --> 27:21.186
Hey! Hey!

27:22.027 --> 27:23.494
- What happened?
- He took off.

27:23.696 --> 27:27.029
- You were supposed to stop him.
- There was no talking him down.

27:27.233 --> 27:30.225
You weren't supposed to negotiate,
just stop him.

27:30.436 --> 27:34.532
- I can't keep him without the hold.
- He didn't know that!

27:35.741 --> 27:37.675
- Sorry.
- Oh, God!

27:38.377 --> 27:41.244
Hold still.
I'm gonna secure this catheter.

27:43.416 --> 27:44.713
You're doing great.

27:45.251 --> 27:48.482
- How much longer?
- A little bit. Just a second here.

27:51.490 --> 27:55.483
Roll back over on your back, okay?
Nice and easy. There you go.

27:58.230 --> 28:01.028
- How long does it take to work?
- 20 minutes for the full effect.

28:01.233 --> 28:03.224
You'll start feeling things soon.

28:03.436 --> 28:07.668
I'm gonna put you on a six-day cycle.
That's three days before the surgery.

28:07.873 --> 28:09.738
And three days after for the drug.

28:09.942 --> 28:12.934
- Dr. Romano.
- Dr. Ross. Hey, Dana.

28:13.145 --> 28:16.603
- I decided I wanted the epidural.
- You did?

28:17.149 --> 28:19.583
You were in surgery,
so I explained the protocol.

28:20.519 --> 28:22.282
- The parents?
- They're onboard.

28:24.423 --> 28:27.517
- Terrific. You got a second?
- Sure.

28:29.361 --> 28:31.556
Be right back. You did great.

28:34.233 --> 28:36.394
Congratulations.
You postponed the surgery.

28:36.602 --> 28:38.536
You didn't leave me any options.

28:38.737 --> 28:40.227
Pedes Attending barely happened.

28:40.439 --> 28:43.567
I thought, "The guy's a maverick.
Good to shake things up."

28:43.776 --> 28:47.337
If you want to play John Wayne,
do it in the ER, not with my patients.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.110
This girl is
in a very vulnerable place.

28:50.316 --> 28:52.341
This is not about being right.

28:52.551 --> 28:55.714
Hell, we all think we're right.
Doesn't make you special.

28:59.124 --> 29:00.113
Fine.

29:01.160 --> 29:04.493
Did you give the kid the cheeseburger
before or after the parents agreed?

29:04.697 --> 29:07.257
Thought I might need 24 hours
to talk them into it.

29:08.734 --> 29:13.137
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Hold on. Let me get a smaller gauge.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.606
- Oh, hey! You.
- Hi.

29:19.812 --> 29:23.043
I have been looking for you.
You forget about me?

29:23.249 --> 29:25.649
Well, no,
I didn't forget about you.

29:25.851 --> 29:29.787
- I've been waiting for three hours.
- Okay, I went to the morgue.

29:29.989 --> 29:32.321
- Me too. He's not there anymore.
- No, he isn't.

29:32.525 --> 29:36.325
- So where did you put him?
- I don't know how to...

29:36.762 --> 29:37.888
How to what?

29:40.165 --> 29:42.497
How to tell you...

29:42.701 --> 29:44.999
...how sorry I am about your loss.

29:45.204 --> 29:47.672
Thank you. But where did you put him?

29:47.907 --> 29:49.602
- Where did I put him?
- You don't remember.

29:49.808 --> 29:52.709
Of course I remember.
I couldn't find you.

29:52.912 --> 29:57.349
I got very busy here.
So I put your brother...

29:57.550 --> 29:59.745
Where did I put him?

30:00.553 --> 30:01.542
Radiology.

30:01.954 --> 30:03.478
I put him in Radiology.

30:03.689 --> 30:06.453
But he was kind of in the way there...

30:06.959 --> 30:09.052
...so I left him...

30:09.461 --> 30:12.862
...here in the hall. I'm sorry.

30:13.065 --> 30:16.000
No problem. I can't believe
I didn't see him there.

30:18.237 --> 30:19.261
He's easy to miss.

30:21.340 --> 30:24.173
- What's wrong?
- There aren't any pregnancy tests.

30:24.376 --> 30:26.936
- How could we be out of them?
- I don't do inventory.

30:27.146 --> 30:28.977
It wasn't an accusation.

30:29.181 --> 30:31.240
- What is that all about?
- What?

30:31.450 --> 30:33.179
The scarf. Where'd you get it?

30:33.385 --> 30:35.478
I got it at the gift shop.
You don't think it works?

30:35.688 --> 30:38.248
- What about your jacket?
- I wanted something different.

30:38.457 --> 30:40.516
Lose the earrings.
It throws the whole thing off.

30:40.726 --> 30:42.091
- Carol. Carol.
- No, no.

30:42.294 --> 30:43.761
I can get it.

30:43.963 --> 30:45.897
I can't have students
starting IVs on kids.

30:46.098 --> 30:48.498
- Can you do it for me?
- Sure.

30:48.667 --> 30:50.259
- Is there a problem?
- No.

30:50.469 --> 30:53.666
I just want experienced staff
starting IVs on kids.

30:53.872 --> 30:57.239
- This is a teaching hospital.
- Not when pain's inflicted on kids.

30:57.443 --> 30:58.910
- Lucy's great.
- It's not about Lucy.

30:59.111 --> 31:02.740
- It's a policy I'm setting.
- You're setting a policy.

31:02.948 --> 31:05.815
Well, first time for everything.

31:12.825 --> 31:14.952
I'd be in a hurry
to get out of here too.

31:15.594 --> 31:16.424
What?

31:16.629 --> 31:19.757
We found out why your liver's failing.
You've been drinking.

31:23.302 --> 31:24.769
You're not gonna believe me.

31:25.771 --> 31:26.795
One time.

31:27.673 --> 31:29.800
I don't believe you.
I checked with UNOS.

31:30.175 --> 31:33.611
You've been on the list
for another transplant for two months.

31:36.515 --> 31:39.416
- Did you tell them?
- Did I tell them what?

31:39.618 --> 31:42.280
That you drank through the first one
and you want another?

31:42.488 --> 31:44.285
It wasn't like that. It was today.

31:44.923 --> 31:47.153
My son passed his bar examination.

31:49.828 --> 31:52.058
I knew I was rejecting,
so I figured what could it hurt?

31:52.264 --> 31:54.425
We had champagne at brunch.
That's it.

31:54.633 --> 31:57.602
You've been lying
ever since you came in here.

31:57.970 --> 32:00.734
Please. You can't tell UNOS.

32:01.940 --> 32:03.339
I don't have a choice.

32:04.043 --> 32:06.978
You're doing this
to me over one glass of champagne?

32:07.179 --> 32:10.478
There are people on that list
who haven't had any champagne.

32:11.450 --> 32:14.419
If I lose my place,
I won't last six months.

32:15.654 --> 32:18.384
You report me, I'm dead.

32:20.559 --> 32:21.787
I'm begging you.

32:27.132 --> 32:29.066
Sorry I'm late. There was traffic.

32:29.268 --> 32:30.599
You take the EI.

32:30.936 --> 32:31.960
- Who's on?
- Weaver.

32:32.171 --> 32:34.833
She's interviewing
for Chief of Emergency Medicine.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.565
- I thought she was Chief.
- Where have you been?

32:37.843 --> 32:40.744
- Dr. Greene?
- He's upstairs interviewing her.

32:40.946 --> 32:43.244
- So we have no Attendings.
- Watch it, Jerry.

32:43.449 --> 32:46.748
Sorry, Dr. Ross. Is he an Attending?

32:47.953 --> 32:50.046
Normally I wouldn't say anything.

32:50.255 --> 32:53.554
But don't you think that attire
is a little inappropriate?

32:53.759 --> 32:57.024
It's business.
I was helping out Dr. Weaver.

32:58.330 --> 33:00.855
Great job, Kerry.
We'd be lucky to have you.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.000
It was a formality.
Thanks for coming.

33:03.202 --> 33:05.136
I appreciate the opportunity.

33:05.337 --> 33:08.431
Your presentation
was everything we expected.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.631
- Thank you.
- I'll walk you down.

33:11.744 --> 33:13.473
It went great, Kerry.

33:13.679 --> 33:16.147
- The pie charts weren't too much?
- Charts are good.

33:16.348 --> 33:18.782
- Did anybody else use them?
- You were the first.

33:18.984 --> 33:22.283
- Lf I came across as too eager...
- No, it went terrific.

33:22.488 --> 33:24.080
Thank you, Mark.

33:24.289 --> 33:27.588
I never know how to answer
that question about my weaknesses.

33:27.793 --> 33:29.886
I could've helped you out there.

33:30.929 --> 33:32.521
That's a nice leather jacket.

33:33.699 --> 33:37.430
I said I wanted to run some tests.
But I can't without Medicaid.

33:37.636 --> 33:38.728
What's wrong?

33:40.105 --> 33:42.938
- This patient is illegal.
- Yes, but it doesn't matter.

33:43.142 --> 33:44.336
Oh, yes, it matters.

33:44.543 --> 33:47.410
The state won't pay for thousands
of dollars worth of tests.

33:47.613 --> 33:49.410
- You won't treat him?
- I'll give him beta blockers.

33:49.615 --> 33:51.014
He could have a cardiac arrest.

33:51.216 --> 33:54.674
- He's had no arrhythmias.
- That's why we need the EP studies.

33:54.887 --> 33:56.548
His father died from this.

33:56.755 --> 33:59.280
- Did you document an arrhythmia?
- No.

33:59.491 --> 34:02.187
All right. Then there is nothing
else that I can do.

34:02.394 --> 34:03.861
- Dr. Kayson!
- What?

34:04.062 --> 34:05.859
This boy could drop dead.

34:06.064 --> 34:09.830
Well, so could a lot of people.
He's not emergent.

34:11.303 --> 34:12.565
I'm sorry.

34:25.650 --> 34:28.085
You said he was stable.
Single GSW to the arm.

34:28.286 --> 34:30.516
- He was.
- He's intubated and hypotensive.

34:30.722 --> 34:32.621
- Things change.
- What's the problem?

34:32.824 --> 34:34.382
Botched gang shooting.
They were ready for him.

34:34.592 --> 34:37.027
- Is this the guy from this morning?
- Yeah. His name's Bo.

34:37.228 --> 34:39.493
We thought it was his arm.
He crashed in the rig.

34:39.697 --> 34:41.928
- Carter, we need your help.
- Come on.

34:42.234 --> 34:46.261
Welcome back, Bo.
Okay, everybody, on my count.

34:46.471 --> 34:48.632
One, two, three.

34:48.841 --> 34:51.469
- Why didn't you recontact?
- Things got pretty crazy.

34:51.677 --> 34:53.007
Carol, put him on the monitor.

34:53.212 --> 34:56.340
- What do we got?
- GSW, mid-tricep area.

34:56.547 --> 34:58.413
- Where's the probe?
- Run it, Carter.

34:58.617 --> 35:01.347
Decreased breath sounds on the right.
Tracheal shift to the left.

35:01.553 --> 35:03.521
- Tension pneumo.
- BP's down to 70.

35:03.722 --> 35:06.748
Pulse ox 89. Damn it!

35:06.959 --> 35:09.052
And then I'm gonna need
a 36 French.

35:09.261 --> 35:10.319
I want to decompress...

35:10.529 --> 35:15.125
...into the second intercostal space,
mid-clavicular line.

35:15.334 --> 35:17.461
Okay. Pulse is getting stronger.

35:17.669 --> 35:19.398
- Lucy, get a blood gas.
- I'll do it.

35:19.605 --> 35:21.470
It's okay. I showed her how.

35:21.673 --> 35:24.642
- Ten blade.
- Get the pressure back on the line.

35:24.843 --> 35:28.040
Entrance wound,
right mid-axillary line.

35:28.614 --> 35:30.309
Bullet went through the arm
into the chest.

35:30.649 --> 35:32.947
- Why couldn't you undress him?
- We had to run.

35:33.151 --> 35:34.812
Where's that chest tube?

35:35.220 --> 35:37.984
- You didn't see this chest wound?
- Not now, Carol.

35:38.190 --> 35:40.886
- I can't get the blood gas.
- Move over. I'll do it.

35:41.093 --> 35:44.324
Chest tube is in. That's okay, Lucy.
Those can be tough.

35:44.529 --> 35:48.488
- Help me with the second line.
- Okay. 50 cc's out.

35:48.700 --> 35:50.827
I need four by fours.
I need elastoplast.

35:51.036 --> 35:53.300
I'm gonna call X-ray,
get a portable chest.

35:53.505 --> 35:56.770
I got the blood gas.
BP's up to 100/70.

35:56.975 --> 35:58.738
- How's that second line?
- I can't.

35:58.944 --> 36:00.912
- Move the drape for more room.
- I can't do it.

36:01.113 --> 36:03.104
- Focus. We need the second line.
- I really can't do it.

36:03.348 --> 36:07.011
- It's like any other IV.
- I haven't started an IV. Never.

36:07.219 --> 36:08.777
I'm sorry.

36:12.958 --> 36:14.858
- Whoa! He's bradying down!
- Okay!

36:15.060 --> 36:16.584
His chest tube is pouring blood!

36:16.795 --> 36:19.923
Let's get two units of O-neg in
and call the O.R.

36:21.033 --> 36:24.002
- You cost me a procedure.
- Am I supposed to ask how?

36:24.202 --> 36:26.067
You should've babysat
that pulseless foot.

36:26.271 --> 36:27.704
Greene let the radiologist set him.

36:27.906 --> 36:31.307
I didn't realize that was part
of my job description.

36:31.510 --> 36:33.375
Well, you're still learning.

36:34.246 --> 36:37.807
- How was your first day?
- As expected.

36:39.284 --> 36:43.220
You are either a masochist
or the stubbornest woman I've met.

36:43.422 --> 36:45.253
But I admire your fortitude.

36:45.457 --> 36:48.654
I couldn't handle taking orders
from a weasel like Dale.

36:49.194 --> 36:52.925
- Is that supposed to be a compliment?
- Sounded like one to me.

36:54.266 --> 36:57.963
And you can wear the long coat.
It looks better on you.

36:59.738 --> 37:02.502
- 700 cc's out the chest tube.
- Take him up, Carter.

37:02.708 --> 37:05.142
- Do they know he needs a thoracotomy?
- Yeah. O.R. 3.

37:05.344 --> 37:08.609
Have the blood bank send up
four units, type-specific.

37:09.047 --> 37:12.016
We weren't prepared for a trauma.
You should've called.

37:12.217 --> 37:14.481
Sorry. We were busy
protecting his airway.

37:14.686 --> 37:18.486
- You guys should've called ahead.
- There was no way...

37:18.690 --> 37:20.851
And we have to be prepared
for anything.

37:21.059 --> 37:22.856
- I would've been prepared...
- Nobody's to blame.

37:23.061 --> 37:25.894
We treated the patient.
Let's move on.

37:26.098 --> 37:28.123
Do you want to review the run tape?

37:28.333 --> 37:29.664
- No.
- No.

37:31.336 --> 37:35.170
Doggy. Yeah!
You want to pet the doggy?

37:36.408 --> 37:38.308
Oh, that is good.

37:38.510 --> 37:40.375
You want him to respond in some way.

37:40.579 --> 37:44.140
To point or to make
some kind of sound.

37:50.122 --> 37:51.487
Kitty says...

37:53.358 --> 37:54.950
Do you want to pet the kitty?

37:58.930 --> 38:01.763
- Don't like the kitty?
- It's okay, man. That's okay.

38:02.601 --> 38:04.193
One quick hug. Then back to work.

38:04.970 --> 38:06.995
- What?
- He's gotta learn to focus.

38:07.472 --> 38:09.667
Give him a break.
He's only a year old.

38:09.875 --> 38:12.810
You can't give him a break.
He's not like other 1 -year-olds.

38:13.278 --> 38:16.145
He needs constant verbal stimuli.

38:19.885 --> 38:20.977
You try.

38:24.089 --> 38:28.150
All right, man. Here we go.
Doggy.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.349
Doggy.

38:31.063 --> 38:32.394
Hey, doggy.

38:41.473 --> 38:42.701
I can't do this.

38:45.444 --> 38:47.139
You're gonna have to learn.

38:47.345 --> 38:49.677
Coming here twice a week
isn't gonna do it.

38:53.485 --> 38:56.511
I might've been able to keep
that kid here this afternoon.

38:56.721 --> 39:01.385
But he would've gone out
and done the same thing tomorrow.

39:01.593 --> 39:03.686
His mom's in Chairs.
You want me to go talk to her?

39:03.895 --> 39:05.726
No. No, I'll do it.

39:20.879 --> 39:23.871
- Did you get a number?
- No. You still here?

39:24.082 --> 39:26.277
Yeah. I got sidetracked.

39:26.485 --> 39:29.045
- You could use some help.
- Okay, take rashes.

39:29.254 --> 39:33.623
- No, something more permanent.
- Allergies?

39:33.825 --> 39:37.852
Actually, I meant being
your full-time P.A.

39:38.063 --> 39:40.497
I'd like to work with kids for a while.

39:40.699 --> 39:43.395
I'm good at it.
Somehow it seems more worthwhile.

39:43.602 --> 39:45.092
Well, I don't know about that.

39:45.303 --> 39:46.998
At least you know whose side
you're on.

39:47.205 --> 39:48.832
You know, I'd love to.

39:49.040 --> 39:51.099
I think I've used up
all my chips with Anspaugh.

39:51.309 --> 39:53.334
I've got some pull.
I could work it out.

39:54.112 --> 39:56.740
- Great. I'd love that.
- Excellent.

40:03.522 --> 40:07.788
Yeah, hi. May I have the transplant
coordinator for UNOS, please?

40:18.370 --> 40:20.838
- I paged you twice.
- I don't want to talk yet.

40:21.039 --> 40:23.337
That's too bad
because I deserve an explanation.

40:23.542 --> 40:27.376
If you want me to feel bad, I do.
I'm really disappointed in myself.

40:27.579 --> 40:29.945
You should be.
That's not an explanation.

40:30.148 --> 40:34.414
I don't know how it started.
You thought I could do it.

40:34.619 --> 40:37.588
I wanted to impress you.
It spun out of control. I'm sorry.

40:37.789 --> 40:41.054
What did you think
you were going to accomplish?

40:41.259 --> 40:42.521
I don't know.

40:43.361 --> 40:46.194
- I thought I could learn on my own.
- You can learn on your own.

40:46.865 --> 40:49.891
You don't need to be here, then.
You endangered patients.

40:50.101 --> 40:52.501
You don't need to make me feel bad!
I feel horrible!

40:52.938 --> 40:55.406
That would work
if this was about you.

40:55.874 --> 40:58.342
But down there it's never about you.

41:00.345 --> 41:03.872
Go home. Don't come back
unless you're serious about learning.

41:05.217 --> 41:08.709
If you ever lie to me again,
you can look for another rotation.

41:29.708 --> 41:31.608
What are you doing back here?

41:31.810 --> 41:33.744
Waiting for the grill to heat up.

41:34.346 --> 41:37.315
I thought it was
fend-for-yourself night.

41:37.515 --> 41:40.882
No. I'm sick of fend-for-yourself.
I got us some steaks.

41:41.086 --> 41:43.953
Sounds good.
You got another one of those for me?

41:46.858 --> 41:48.120
What's in the bag?

41:49.027 --> 41:52.224
It's a pregnancy test.

41:53.198 --> 41:54.358
Just to be sure.

41:56.101 --> 41:57.864
No need. I started my period.

42:06.645 --> 42:08.943
Well, I guess I wasted $17.50.

42:10.048 --> 42:11.606
Save it for next time.

42:13.151 --> 42:15.051
I'm kidding. That was a joke.

42:17.122 --> 42:19.056
We dodged a bullet there, didn't we?

42:23.228 --> 42:26.197
- That's good, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

42:28.333 --> 42:32.064
Although all day, I kept thinking,
"Wow, a kid."

42:32.270 --> 42:33.862
You know, that would really...

42:35.607 --> 42:36.938
...change my life.

42:37.142 --> 42:40.771
- Our life. It would change ours.
- Okay. Our lives.

42:50.021 --> 42:51.648
That would be bad, right?

42:53.525 --> 42:56.756
I changed my mind.
I don't want to joke about it.

43:14.045 --> 43:15.672
Maybe I'm not joking.
