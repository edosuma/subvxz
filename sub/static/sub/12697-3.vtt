WEBVTT

00:02.970 --> 00:04.838
- They're not gonna laugh
at you.

00:04.872 --> 00:06.607
This time.
Come on.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.042
- [exhales]

00:08.076 --> 00:10.244
Hey, Spence, are we supposed
to be doing something

00:10.278 --> 00:12.480
while you talk to that corner?

00:12.513 --> 00:14.748
- Sorry, I just gotta get
this speech right.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.218
You guys are my last rehearsal
before my dress rehearsal

00:17.251 --> 00:19.920
before my final dress rehearsal
before my opening.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.822
But yeah, help yourself
to the sumptuous feast

00:21.855 --> 00:23.757
I painstakingly prepared.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.260
- You put out old takeout boxes
from last week.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.096
- And you didn't even
put out silverware.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.298
- Okay, before I reveal
the centerpiece

00:30.331 --> 00:31.965
of my upcoming exhibition,

00:31.999 --> 00:33.267
I'd like to recite
a short poem.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.968
- [laughs]
What is this, a TED Talk?

00:35.002 --> 00:36.837
I'm just joking.
I know it's not.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.140
Ted was a friend of the family.

00:40.674 --> 00:43.977
- What is a feeling?
How does one define a rainbow?

00:44.011 --> 00:47.348
If a bamboo breaks--
- [laughs]

00:47.381 --> 00:49.283
Oh, sorry, Spencer. Hold on.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.220
I love this squirrel
getting a manicure meme.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.089
It says so much
without saying anything.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.958
- Mm. I'm saying something.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.293
- I used to find that funny,

00:59.327 --> 01:01.028
but now I follow a number
of squirrel accounts

01:01.061 --> 01:03.764
that found the nail polish
color highly problematic.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.068
- Okay, let's give Spencer
the attention he deserves.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.203
- Thank you.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.238
Harper, would you do me
the honor

01:10.271 --> 01:11.505
of capturing the unveiling

01:11.539 --> 01:12.973
to show my future children,

01:13.006 --> 01:15.042
Banksy and Basquiat?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.477
I'm assuming
they'll be artists,

01:16.510 --> 01:19.280
but if not, they'll be
very cool accountants.

01:19.313 --> 01:22.816
May I present...
"Soliloquies In Time."

01:22.850 --> 01:25.286
- Ugh.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.488
[camera shutter clicks]

01:27.521 --> 01:29.290
- This needs to be
in the Guggenheim.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.891
- But not in the bathroom
this time!

01:30.924 --> 01:32.226
Fool me once.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.927
- No, not your sculpture.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.263
This pic I just took of Carly

01:35.296 --> 01:37.565
spitting out your nasty
leftover meatballs.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.367
[laughs]
You have to post this.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.768
I'm PearDropping it now.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.436
[phone dings]

01:42.470 --> 01:43.937
- [laughing]
Oh, my God.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.539
How should I caption it?

01:45.573 --> 01:48.309
"When your leftovers
should have just been left."

01:48.342 --> 01:49.610
You guys get it?

01:49.643 --> 01:52.213
'Cause, like, left and left.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.847
- At least you're pretty.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.886
- * I know you see

01:58.919 --> 02:01.422
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

02:01.455 --> 02:04.892
[together]
* And be so wonderful

02:04.925 --> 02:08.829
- * So wake up the members
of my nation *

02:08.862 --> 02:10.364
[together]
* It's your time to be

02:10.398 --> 02:13.534
- * There's no chance
unless you take one *

02:13.567 --> 02:16.204
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

02:16.237 --> 02:19.473
* Of every situation

02:19.507 --> 02:21.141
* Some things
are meant to be *

02:21.175 --> 02:24.712
* So give me your best
and leave the rest to me *

02:26.347 --> 02:27.581
- Did you know
that Manicure Squirrel

02:27.615 --> 02:29.717
does nail art tutorials now?

02:29.750 --> 02:31.252
I know I'm supposed
to be editing,

02:31.285 --> 02:32.886
but want to watch
every single one of them?

02:32.920 --> 02:34.455
- That squirrel's
an anti-vaxxer.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.590
- Damn it.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.792
- Carly, you're number one!

02:38.826 --> 02:41.829
- And Harper, you're great too!
- Yes.

02:41.862 --> 02:45.165
But the photo that you posted,
you're number one on IMemeDb!

02:45.199 --> 02:46.467
- [screams]
Screw you,

02:46.500 --> 02:48.101
baby confused by Pop Rocks!

02:48.135 --> 02:49.403
- [laughs]

02:49.437 --> 02:51.305
Ooh, that baby gonna be mad!
- Ay!

02:52.873 --> 02:55.008
- Interesting.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.978
- Carly, you need to capitalize
on this moment.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.113
Re-share some of the funniest
meatball face memes.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.583
You'll drive a ton of traffic
to your channel.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.118
- But do I want to use this
to drive traffic?

03:05.152 --> 03:06.086
It's not my favorite look.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.588
- Doesn't matter!

03:07.621 --> 03:09.790
All publicity
is good publicity.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.025
'Cause when people like
your face, they'll be all like,

03:12.059 --> 03:13.894
"How can I see
more of that face?"

03:13.927 --> 03:16.430
And that's where
the merch comes in.

03:16.464 --> 03:19.700
- Wait, merch? I don't know.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.570
I just relaunched,
and it still feels new.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.972
Like a fawn
trying its little legs out.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.775
Maybe I should just wait a beat
and see how things shake out.

03:27.808 --> 03:31.111
- You don't have a beat, Bambi.
You're hot now.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.782
Tomorrow, someone's gonna eat
a moldy cannoli and go like--

03:35.683 --> 03:38.952
And then you'll be
the next baby with Pop Rocks.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.087
- Harper's right.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.490
Strike while the meatball
is rancid.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.558
- Okay. Yeah.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.460
This is a good opportunity.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.496
Harper, can we do keychains?

03:48.529 --> 03:49.930
- We can try.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.965
My keychain guy hasn't been
getting back to me.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.968
- Grandma B. says

03:55.002 --> 03:57.571
your oatmeal got cold,
and somehow it's my fault.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.040
- Oh, she's not blaming me.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.943
- Millicent, Carly's number one
on IMemeDb.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.279
- Too bad Carly's reign
will be short-lived.

04:05.313 --> 04:09.249
And then she'll come to regret
ever having had a face at all.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.651
- What is there to regret?

04:10.684 --> 04:12.953
It's a photo of Carly
spitting out a meatball.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.221
- Precisely!

04:14.254 --> 04:16.357
In a few years,
we could all be vegans.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.791
Or not be allowed to spit

04:17.825 --> 04:19.593
because of
a worldwide pandemic.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.128
- [laughs]

04:21.161 --> 04:24.565
- Don't worry about things
that will never happen.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.001
- Ooh, 26 pizzerias
just followed me.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.237
Hello, free garlic knots.
- Oh!

04:30.270 --> 04:32.440
- How can you not see
that this meatball

04:32.473 --> 04:34.575
is a ticking time bomb?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.244
I'm gonna check your timeline
for more offensive content.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.548
- Aww, that's cute.
You're protecting Carly.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.851
- No! I want to cancel Carly.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.820
- Right, yeah,
that makes more sense.

04:46.854 --> 04:47.821
- Freddie?
- Yeah?

04:47.855 --> 04:49.390
- You wanna dad it up?

04:49.423 --> 04:50.924
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.794
Uh, there's nothing I can do
to stop you, right?

04:53.827 --> 04:55.796
- Nothing.
- All righty, have fun.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.401
- Interesting.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.838
[upbeat music]

05:04.872 --> 05:07.541
[both laughing]

05:07.575 --> 05:10.978
- The memes you're sharing
have ruined my life!

05:11.011 --> 05:12.580
- Did they take
your millions of dollars

05:12.613 --> 05:14.948
and the food from your fridge
and the clothes off your back?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.351
- Worse.
They've taken my dignity.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.486
Listen.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.654
"When your man calls me."

05:22.022 --> 05:24.658
"When he says
he has five roommates."

05:26.026 --> 05:29.262
"when you realize
cartoon characters can be hot."

05:29.296 --> 05:32.766
- Ooh, that's so true though.
[both laugh]

05:32.800 --> 05:34.201
- You guys, it's not funny.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.404
People think you're making
that face about my art.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.871
- What? No.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.507
You can see
the disgusting meatball

05:39.540 --> 05:40.974
right there in my hand.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.010
If anything,
I'm highlighting your art.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.479
Look at this article
on QuackFeed.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.347
Okay, "Don't hate me,

05:47.381 --> 05:50.551
"but the artwork in the back
of the Meatball Face meme

05:50.584 --> 05:52.753
is actually kinda good."

05:54.321 --> 05:56.123
- That's the best
you could find?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.725
Kinda good?

05:57.758 --> 05:59.359
With a question mark?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.195
Carly,
my opening is this weekend,

06:02.229 --> 06:03.531
and all people
are talking about

06:03.564 --> 06:05.966
are my leftovers and your face.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.868
- Okay, yeah. I hear you.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.537
But I just restarted "iCarly"

06:09.570 --> 06:12.172
and these memes are
really helping my channel.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.340
What do you want me to do?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.308
- The least you could do
is apologize.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.144
- But I didn't
do anything wrong.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.012
- [high-pitched]
Didn't you?

06:20.848 --> 06:24.051
- Fine.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.119
I'm sorry if your feelings
are hurt.

06:27.287 --> 06:29.389
I didn't realize
you were so sensitive.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.829
- What kind of fauxpology
was that?

06:35.863 --> 06:38.131
- Fauxpology? Love!

06:38.165 --> 06:40.100
That is a perfect caption
for Meatball Face.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.971
- Totally!
"When you hear a fauxpology."

06:44.004 --> 06:45.305
Wait, how do you spell that?

06:45.338 --> 06:48.275
- Oh, you spell it
R-U-kidding me?

06:48.308 --> 06:51.144
[doorbell rings]

06:51.178 --> 06:53.814
- Spencer, you know
how cutthroat it is out here.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.148
All these new platforms

06:55.182 --> 06:57.585
and influencers getting
younger and younger.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.386
It's like Harper always says.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.421
"You gotta switch it up
on a bitch!"

07:02.756 --> 07:04.492
I'll never say that again.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.260
- It was cute though.
You tried.

07:07.294 --> 07:10.263
- Tomorrow, I could be beaten
by a moldy cannoli.

07:10.297 --> 07:13.100
Pop Rocks baby
is already in rehab.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.535
- All right. I get it.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.436
Just don't add
any more fuel to the fire.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.638
- Ba-bam!

07:17.671 --> 07:20.173
Who wants
a Carly meatball face T-shirt?

07:20.207 --> 07:21.742
- Oh, my God,
these are adorable.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.976
- I know!

07:23.010 --> 07:24.478
- Is it gauche
to wear your own face?

07:24.512 --> 07:25.946
- No, your face is--

07:25.979 --> 07:27.948
- Seriously?

07:27.981 --> 07:29.950
- Spencer, it's like
I told Carly.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.219
There's no such thing
as bad publicity!

07:32.252 --> 07:34.187
This meme is good
for all of us.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.889
You're getting your name
out there.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.224
I learned that my keychain guy

07:37.257 --> 07:39.159
isn't ghosting me,
he's just dead.

07:41.361 --> 07:44.798
- Plus, feel the material.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.601
- Oh wow, that is soft.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.902
Fine.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.639
I'll wear it to bed,
and only that.

07:51.672 --> 07:57.010
*

07:57.044 --> 07:59.412
- Millicent,
you can come back now.

07:59.446 --> 08:02.249
My mom is no longer
using up all our bandwidth

08:02.282 --> 08:05.185
video-chatting with her
Christian Book Club.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.720
- Good, because I was
just finishing

08:06.754 --> 08:10.390
my timeline audit, on you.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.625
- What?

08:11.659 --> 08:13.093
I thought you were
doing an audit on Carly.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.128
- I was,
but all I found were posts

08:15.162 --> 08:17.765
supporting puppy
and cat adoption centers.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.200
She's a saint.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.537
You, on the other hand.
Cyberbullying.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.873
- Cyberbullying? Against who?

08:25.906 --> 08:27.541
- Against me.

08:27.575 --> 08:31.144
Eight years ago at 3:47 p.m.,
you wrote, and I quote,

08:31.178 --> 08:33.947
"I never, ever, ever, ever,
ever want kids.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.583
Ever!"

08:35.616 --> 08:37.150
- I was joking!

08:37.184 --> 08:38.351
- Then you said,

08:38.385 --> 08:41.254
"If you think I'm joking,
I am not!"

08:42.923 --> 08:44.424
- Okay, wow.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.527
I know that sounds bad,
but this was from so long ago,

08:47.561 --> 08:50.463
I was probably wearing Crocs
when I wrote it.

08:50.497 --> 08:53.233
- Why?
Did you use to be a nurse?

08:53.266 --> 08:54.668
- No, I just like a shoe

08:54.702 --> 08:57.370
that's easy to clean
and comes in fun, bold colors.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.073
Millicent, I'm sorry.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.541
Tell me
how I can make this right.

09:01.575 --> 09:05.412
- A six-pack
of Red Lamb energy drink.

09:05.445 --> 09:08.181
- Red Lamb?
That's just caffeine and sugar.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.819
- And red food dye number five.
That's what makes it delicious.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.724
- You can't drink that.
It's not good for kids.

09:16.757 --> 09:20.393
- Emotional trauma isn't good
for kids either, and yet...

09:20.427 --> 09:22.295
- Regular or Banana Blast?

09:22.329 --> 09:28.035
*

09:28.068 --> 09:29.136
- Oh, my God!

09:29.169 --> 09:31.404
Spencer Shay. I'm such a fan.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.940
- Oh, that's so sweet!

09:32.973 --> 09:34.675
It's nice to be recognized
for one's work.

09:34.708 --> 09:38.378
- You're meatball brother.
- Uh-huh. Also that.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.613
- I'm Willow.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.615
I run a super popular
food art Insta

09:41.649 --> 09:43.483
called "You Aren't
What You Eat.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.719
Just Kidding, You Are."
[laughs]

09:45.753 --> 09:47.220
- Wow, food art?

09:47.254 --> 09:49.723
So, like, thought-provoking
sculptures using food or--

09:49.757 --> 09:52.192
- No, I take pictures
of what I eat for lunch.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.061
I've had six shows
at this gallery.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.197
- Oh, I've got a show here too.
Just the one.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.767
- Oh, you're an artist too?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.835
Cute.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.403
Wait. Let me just--

10:03.436 --> 10:06.206
- Oh.
- Say, "meatball!"

10:06.239 --> 10:08.008
- Ahh, no!

10:08.041 --> 10:10.077
Ahh!

10:10.110 --> 10:12.245
I am not gonna cry.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.715
You know what? I'm gonna cry.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.116
- Sorry.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.753
- Oh, are you? Are you sorry?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.221
Well, I'm sorry!

10:21.254 --> 10:24.024
Sorry I live in a culture
that's so obsessed with memes

10:24.057 --> 10:27.627
and likes and fake art
and fake apologies and--

10:27.661 --> 10:28.929
oh.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.198
I've got an idea.

10:31.231 --> 10:35.368
I am reborn!

10:37.470 --> 10:39.539
- Yeah.
I have that effect on people.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.481
- Millicent, check it out.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.818
Carly meatball face T-shirts.

10:50.851 --> 10:54.054
- They're $40.
But for you, $39.99.

10:54.087 --> 10:57.758
- I'd rather wear a shirt
made out of human hair.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.061
Besides, I don't need
your flimsy discount.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.564
I'm about to be BeyoncÃ© rich
with my new business.

11:04.597 --> 11:07.100
- What did I tell you about
taking Bey's name in vain?

11:07.134 --> 11:09.302
- Oh, it's not in vain.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.704
Since finding
Freddie's old posts

11:10.738 --> 11:12.539
turned out to be profitable,

11:12.572 --> 11:15.508
I realized that there's a hole
in the market.

11:15.542 --> 11:18.545
Any Gen Z kid can tell you
what's offensive now,

11:18.578 --> 11:21.581
but only Millicent can predict
what will offend next.

11:21.614 --> 11:25.052
I am the Offensive Oracle.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.224
- Oh, this card stock is legit.
- Mm-hmm.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.592
Want me to scrub
your social media

11:32.625 --> 11:35.528
for a friends and family rate
of $500?

11:35.562 --> 11:37.798
- I'd rather wear a shirt made
out of human hair.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.000
- And you can make one
with all you shed.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.702
- [laughs]
[coughs]

11:42.736 --> 11:45.372
- I even wrote a jingle
for my Super Bowl commercial.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.707
* Remember that we all post

11:47.741 --> 11:50.410
* From our own place
of privilege *

11:50.443 --> 11:52.379
* Just take into account

11:52.412 --> 11:55.248
* We all have
disparate opinions *

11:55.282 --> 11:59.987
* So if you're feeling worried
you might be problematic *

12:00.020 --> 12:02.655
* Just call up
your friend Millicent *

12:02.689 --> 12:04.424
* Or go read a book

12:04.457 --> 12:06.593
* It's not my job
to educate you *

12:06.626 --> 12:11.131
* Unless you pay me money

12:13.466 --> 12:15.268
- No one's gonna
remember that song.

12:15.302 --> 12:18.772
- But the world will remember
what you did to Spencer.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.441
Unless you purchase
my "Meme Sweep" package.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.743
It's where I get
Republican Senators over 70

12:23.777 --> 12:26.513
to use your meme
so no one else wants to.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.614
- Now, hold on.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.917
We are not sweeping any memes

12:29.950 --> 12:32.219
until these tees are sold out.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.422
Which reminds me, I need to do
some Instagram Live promo.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.893
What's popping,
fashionistas, fashionistos,

12:39.927 --> 12:41.661
and fashionistxs?

12:41.694 --> 12:45.632
I just got a new shipment
of meatball tees

12:45.665 --> 12:48.501
in every size, color,
under the rainbow.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.938
Oh, hey, Ray-Ray!

12:50.971 --> 12:52.940
- That's actually a great idea!

12:52.973 --> 12:55.809
I can do a livestream
of Spencer's show.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.377
That way,
people's focus will be off

12:57.410 --> 12:59.779
my admittedly hilarious
meme face

12:59.813 --> 13:01.248
and right back
on Spencer's art,

13:01.281 --> 13:02.782
where it belongs.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.651
I wish I was my sister.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.156
- Hi, Millicent.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.224
I know
you're still upset with me,

13:11.258 --> 13:13.827
but I think
this will do the trick.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.965
It's a USA Bae Doll!

13:17.998 --> 13:20.133
I even found one
with your name!

13:20.167 --> 13:22.970
She's from the...
British colonial era.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.473
Nothing problematic about that.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.908
- Ooh, thanks!

13:27.941 --> 13:30.543
This totally erases the trauma
you inflicted on me.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.212
With more trauma.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.848
- Millicent, it's just
an old post.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.649
- Oh, my gosh,
you didn't even get me

13:36.683 --> 13:38.585
the scarlet fever add-on pack!

13:38.618 --> 13:42.222
- Well, I--

13:42.255 --> 13:43.723
- Wow.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.325
I always wanted
one of these as a kid.

13:46.559 --> 13:49.596
And now that I'm holding it...

13:49.629 --> 13:51.164
I finally have one.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.235
[upbeat music]

13:55.268 --> 13:57.170
*

13:57.204 --> 13:59.539
- Yes, you look good, girl!
Tell your friends.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.708
All of 'em.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.310
- Harper, what are you
doing here?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.879
- Oh, Spencer asked me to come.
At first I was like, "Why?"

14:05.913 --> 14:08.348
But then immediately,
I was like, "I don't care."

14:08.381 --> 14:11.151
- Maybe we can finally put this
whole meme thing behind us.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.586
- Uh-huh. Maybe.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.922
- Hi, friends!

14:14.955 --> 14:17.124
I'm coming to you
live from the grand opening

14:17.157 --> 14:19.692
of my brother Spencer's
newest art show!

14:19.726 --> 14:22.930
- And these shirts are made
with 100% recyclable materials,

14:22.963 --> 14:25.398
so be bad,
buy that premium gas.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.435
- Before I go in,
I just want to say,

14:28.468 --> 14:31.905
most of the meatball face memes
you've been making are amazing.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.407
Some of them,
a little offensive.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.076
Three of you need therapy.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.745
But Spencer isn't
just the meme guy.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.580
He's a really talented artist.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.382
And this night is
all about Spencer

14:42.415 --> 14:45.185
and has nothing
to do with me or--

14:45.218 --> 14:49.089
my face!

14:53.826 --> 14:56.930
- Okay, well, he's on board
with the meme.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.266
In a really big way.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.137
"The Museum of Influence."

15:05.272 --> 15:09.409
So this is different
than I expected.

15:09.442 --> 15:13.380
Oh, look, a slideshow.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.482
@JacquenessMonster.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.917
"I'd rather be constipated
for a month

15:17.951 --> 15:20.053
than read your blog."

15:20.087 --> 15:23.856
[laughs nervously]
Love that he's amplifying that.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.759
What do we have here?

15:26.793 --> 15:28.261
- Like, like, like!

15:28.295 --> 15:31.164
Does this make your empty soul
feel better?

15:31.198 --> 15:33.666
- A hateful like button.
[laughs]

15:33.700 --> 15:36.169
Deep?

15:36.203 --> 15:39.639
Oh, look, lattes. This is cute.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.808
And the foam says...

15:41.841 --> 15:45.078
"Is this art?"

15:45.112 --> 15:47.314
I bet the answer is yes!
[chuckles]

15:48.415 --> 15:50.783
We got a lot of comments
coming in.

15:50.817 --> 15:53.153
Most of you don't seem
to be loving it,

15:53.186 --> 15:56.189
but why don't we talk
to some true art aficionados

15:56.223 --> 15:58.791
and get a more nuanced take.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.428
Hey, I'm Carly Shay
of "iCarly."

16:01.461 --> 16:04.264
- I'm Willow,
of this impermanent Earth.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.899
- You seem to really be
enjoying this show.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.968
Would you want to be
on my Insta Live review?

16:09.002 --> 16:11.704
- Sure. I'm really charismatic.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.107
- [laughs]
Okay.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.442
So tell me your thoughts on--

16:15.475 --> 16:18.745
- "A Single Pringle"
is the opposite of art.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.214
Everyone knows that real art
is putting two Pringles

16:21.248 --> 16:23.183
in your mouth
facing opposite directions

16:23.216 --> 16:25.285
so you look like
a potato chip duck.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.557
I, for one hand,
am personally offended.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.326
- That's one way to look at it,
but don't you think

16:33.360 --> 16:36.263
you're taking this
a little too personally?

16:36.296 --> 16:39.899
- Oh, so I'm guessing
you haven't seen that, then?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.737
- [distorted]
This is still "iCarly,"

16:44.771 --> 16:46.306
but it's grown up now,

16:46.339 --> 16:48.508
so today I thought I'd share
my skincare routine.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.344
- What is this hell?

16:51.378 --> 16:52.845
- My review?

16:52.879 --> 16:55.848
If you want to see a show
all about hating the internet--

16:55.882 --> 17:00.453
- And me, come on down
to the "Museum of Influence."

17:00.487 --> 17:02.922
- Listen, Carly,
us influencers,

17:02.955 --> 17:04.457
we have to stick together.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.160
I'll go find more people
to be mad with us.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.731
- Hello, sister.

17:11.764 --> 17:15.102
Or should I say...nemesister?

17:16.736 --> 17:19.939
- Spencer, what is this place?
It's really mean.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.675
To me, and to lattes.

17:22.709 --> 17:27.013
- Mission accomplished.
- Seriously. People are pissed.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.448
I just talked
to this girl, Willow,

17:28.481 --> 17:31.017
and she said this entire place
is really offensive.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.455
God, she doesn't
even understand

17:35.488 --> 17:37.424
that you're mocking her
and her profile pics.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.726
- Mission accomplished,
the sequel!

17:41.261 --> 17:43.096
- You know,
the internet has the power

17:43.130 --> 17:44.897
to bring people together.

17:44.931 --> 17:50.103
But to you, I guess everything
online is just some big joke.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.772
Maybe I've never made
a fancy sculpture

17:52.805 --> 17:54.707
or painted a flower

17:54.741 --> 17:59.078
or put a Pringle on a pedestal,
but my content still has value.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.347
And you know what?

18:00.380 --> 18:02.882
Likes do make
my empty soul feel better!

18:02.915 --> 18:05.385
But that's just because
it's been scientifically proven

18:05.418 --> 18:06.653
to release dopamine!

18:11.057 --> 18:12.992
- Hey, Millicent.
Did I miss anything?

18:13.025 --> 18:14.627
- Just my sales spike.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.530
This exhibit is just a reminder
for people to be more careful

18:17.564 --> 18:19.532
about what they post online.
- Hmm.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.668
- Anyway, I'm sad.
What's in the bag?

18:22.669 --> 18:25.338
- Well, I thought since you're
starting a new business,

18:25.372 --> 18:29.075
I'd buy you...a new keyboard.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.479
- Wow! Thanks, Freddie.
- Yeah.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.481
So this place is what,

18:34.514 --> 18:36.883
just skewering things
on the internet?

18:36.916 --> 18:40.153
Ooh, where's the part where
they make fun of JavaScript?

18:42.889 --> 18:45.625
@NotMilllicent123.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.261
"Manipulating parents
is so easy.

18:48.295 --> 18:52.165
Check out my new keys."

18:52.199 --> 18:53.600
Seriously?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.268
- [laughs]

18:55.302 --> 18:59.372
It says NotMillicent123,
so obviously it's not me.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.842
- Millicent.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.312
- Ugh, fine. It's me.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.914
Millicent. 123.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.718
- So, you're not
actually traumatized?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.853
- No, I just took advantage
of your insecurities

19:13.886 --> 19:15.588
about being a new parent
to get some cool stuff.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.557
- Mm.
- Thanks for the keyboard.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.592
- Yeah, bah, bah. Uh-uh.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.329
Was there an apology in there?
- Come on!

19:22.362 --> 19:24.163
An admission of guilt
isn't enough?

19:24.197 --> 19:26.098
- Not in 2021.

19:26.132 --> 19:29.602
Who do you think you are,
a high-profile male celebrity?

19:29.636 --> 19:32.439
You pretended to be hurt
so that I would buy you stuff.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.106
It's my keyboard now.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.575
- You're right.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.177
Thank you for teaching me
a moral lesson.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.880
It's better than any gift
you could have ever gotten me.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.517
- You're welcome, Millicent.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.086
You know what? Here.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.655
Take the keyboard.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.524
- You're so easy.
[laughs]

19:53.192 --> 19:54.794
- Yo!

19:54.827 --> 19:56.529
Thousands of people saw
that Live,

19:56.563 --> 19:59.366
and they're coming here, like,
to actually protest!

19:59.399 --> 20:02.435
- Well, I'm glad the world is
finally gonna take my side.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.371
- Oh, no, they're coming
to protest you.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.606
Carly, you are so radical!

20:06.639 --> 20:08.741
You started a whole-ass riot.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.710
It's yet to be seen
what this will do for sales,

20:10.743 --> 20:13.246
but I'll keep y'all posted.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.014
- Oh, crap.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.584
Gamers are putting
down their controllers,

20:17.617 --> 20:19.018
foodies are sharpening
their knives,

20:19.051 --> 20:22.555
and ASMR stans are coming here
to yell at you, quietly.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.857
- [whispering]
Screw you, loser.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.663
- After witnessing
Carly Shay's livestream,

20:30.697 --> 20:32.365
I encourage all other members

20:32.399 --> 20:34.334
of the Coalition
of Latte Artists

20:34.367 --> 20:37.304
to cancel Spencer Shay!

20:37.337 --> 20:39.306
His art is like expired milk.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.574
- Everybody listen up.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.142
My name is Willow,

20:43.175 --> 20:47.680
and as an influencer
who influences the influential,

20:47.714 --> 20:51.250
I am appalled
by this sham of a museum.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.252
- It's a revolution!
[all cheering]

20:53.286 --> 20:55.622
- Spencer sucks.
- Spencer sucks.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.290
- Yeah, get him!
[all shouting]

20:57.324 --> 21:00.493
- Hey, hey, thank you all
for coming.

21:00.527 --> 21:03.630
- Boo!
all: Boo!

21:03.663 --> 21:05.798
- Hey, look, I just want
everyone to know

21:05.832 --> 21:07.567
I didn't mean
to offend you all.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.370
I only meant to offend
my sister, Carly Shay.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.904
There she is! She sucks!

21:11.938 --> 21:13.740
- Just apologize
to these people.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.842
- [whispering]
We demand an apology.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.877
- I can barely hear
whoever said that.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.848
Look, Spencer, it's okay
to apologize for something

21:21.881 --> 21:24.016
that you didn't
necessarily mean to--

21:25.518 --> 21:28.187
Oh.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.590
Spencer, I'm sorry.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.560
I shouldn't have ignored
your feelings.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.462
I real apologize.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.030
- Hey, Carly, I'm sorry

21:38.064 --> 21:40.032
that I retooled
my entire art exhibit

21:40.066 --> 21:43.202
to critique the internet
and take you down.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.104
Come here.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.039
Oh, but you've got to admit,
that small black room

21:47.073 --> 21:49.175
where you can scream
into the void is pretty sweet.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.778
[screaming]

21:51.811 --> 21:53.480
- Yeah, we're still mad.

21:53.513 --> 21:56.248
all: Yeah!
- What, seriously?

21:56.282 --> 21:59.151
[all shouting]

21:59.185 --> 22:01.287
- I sold out, baby!

22:01.320 --> 22:03.155
[laughs]

22:03.189 --> 22:06.393
- Harper, a little help here?
- Oh, on it.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.760
Look, over there!

22:07.794 --> 22:09.729
Someone's sharing
their negative opinion

22:09.762 --> 22:12.832
about a TV show
you liked as a child!

22:12.865 --> 22:15.334
- Let's get 'em.
all: Yeah!

22:15.368 --> 22:17.269
- Get them! Let's get that guy!

22:17.303 --> 22:21.374
[all shouting]

22:21.408 --> 22:23.743
- You're welcome.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.746
[upbeat music]

22:26.779 --> 22:28.715
*

22:28.748 --> 22:30.783
- * Remember that we all post

22:30.817 --> 22:33.285
* From our own place
of privilege *

22:33.319 --> 22:35.655
both:
* Just take into account

22:35.688 --> 22:38.758
* We all have
disparate opinions *

22:38.791 --> 22:41.127
trio: * So if you're
feeling worried *

22:41.160 --> 22:44.096
* You might be problematic

22:44.130 --> 22:46.599
all: * Just call up
your friend Millicent *

22:46.633 --> 22:48.868
* Or go read a book

22:48.901 --> 22:50.970
- * It's not my job
to educate you *

22:51.003 --> 22:55.408
* Unless you pay me money

22:55.442 --> 22:57.343
- Whoo!
- Mm-hmm,

22:57.376 --> 23:02.749
- Yes!
- Mm-hmm.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.151
- Oh, my God,
I'm gonna win a Grammy!
