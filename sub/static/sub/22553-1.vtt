GPS voice
please use left-hand Lane.

01:07.802 --> 01:10.145
Woman people should be
close to what matters most.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.314
When we think of this,
we think of future years.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.449

GPS voice you are arriving...

01:26.854 --> 01:29.765
At your destination.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.466
Woman
when we think of work places...

01:31.525 --> 01:34.803
We think of creating different
possibilities.

01:34.862 --> 01:39.564
Va industries, a new way
of thinking for a big world.

02:03.223 --> 02:05.167
Reporter military
technology has advanced...

02:05.226 --> 02:06.792
Exponentially.

02:11.197 --> 02:14.342
Now va industries has
introduced us to a new age...

02:14.401 --> 02:18.637
Of combat, unmanned, robotic
war machines.

02:20.273 --> 02:22.651
Va's military division now
makes up...

02:22.710 --> 02:24.653
80 percent of their business.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.289
Thousands of civilian
casualties...

02:27.348 --> 02:29.858
Have been reported as a result
of the global wars.

02:29.917 --> 02:33.795
They say va industries
is responsible.

02:33.854 --> 02:38.757
They say its ceo, Elias Van
dorne, is responsible.

02:38.816 --> 02:52.516
_

02:53.573 --> 02:55.784
Automated voice
welcome to va industries.

02:55.843 --> 02:59.378
We are the worldwide leaders
of humanity.

03:08.454 --> 03:12.767
They don't value all
we've given them.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.537
They say the wars are our fault.

03:15.596 --> 03:20.542
Our technologies... too many,
too fast.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.378
They weren't ready for them.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.470
The wars will pass.

03:26.506 --> 03:29.784
They're not ready for kronos.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.920
It's the only way.

03:31.979 --> 03:38.593
Elias, you know what kronos
is capable of.

03:38.652 --> 03:43.755
Capable of saving earth
from self destruction.

03:52.365 --> 03:55.066
It's activated, sir.

03:58.371 --> 04:00.572
And it's asking for you.

04:15.888 --> 04:19.434
Who are you?

04:19.493 --> 04:22.971
I am the one you seek.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.507
I am your creator.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.033
I gave you life.

04:33.873 --> 04:39.077
Tell me... what do you see?

04:40.480 --> 04:44.049
I will show you.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.521
Do not be afraid.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.764
Welcome back, Andrew Davis.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.432
News anchor
there have been reports...

05:24.491 --> 05:27.369
That a new exoplanet
has been discovered.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.838
Scientists believe it could be
the strongest candidate...

05:29.897 --> 05:33.975
Yet to be capable of supporting
life.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.811
Up next, we take you back live,
with complete coverage...

05:36.870 --> 05:40.305
From the highly anticipated va
industries press conference.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.617
Hey, mom.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.718
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.354
Find out soon here on news 32.

05:46.413 --> 05:50.215
Aw, you're so sweet.
Thank you.

05:51.819 --> 05:55.253
And is approximately
22 light years away.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.896
They're beautiful.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.943
How are you?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.870
Oh, I'm fine.

06:20.747 --> 06:23.792
Announcer
up next, va industries' ceo...

06:23.851 --> 06:26.728
Elias Van dorne is expected
to announce the details...

06:26.787 --> 06:29.764
Of his highly anticipated
project, kronos.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.834
Very little is known about
kronos, but sources say...

06:32.893 --> 06:35.870
It is unlike anything the world
has ever seen.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.440
There have been large protests
all over the globe...

06:38.499 --> 06:40.608
In anticipation of the
announcement.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.976
And theories about what
exactly kronos is...

06:42.035 --> 06:43.445
I have to go, mom.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.204
Oh, all right.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.085
Don't work too hard.

06:50.144 --> 06:52.077
I won't.

07:06.793 --> 07:10.638
You have all lost so much.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.541
We intend to restore it to you.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.679
I stand before you
tonight to announce...

07:17.738 --> 07:23.985
The first true artificial
intelligence: Kronos.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.588
True artificial intelligence...

07:26.647 --> 07:27.989
Kronos will soon solve...

07:28.048 --> 07:32.560
The problems that have
plagued humanity.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.096
Problems that have plagued
humanity.

07:35.155 --> 07:39.691
Kronos represents the
rejuvenation of life...

07:44.197 --> 07:49.234
on this planet, for our future.

07:54.006 --> 08:02.006
Tonight, this night...
We enter a new age.

08:21.968 --> 08:25.180
Kronos this is kronos.

08:25.239 --> 08:27.272
Do not be afraid.

08:29.742 --> 08:34.212
Our once beautiful world
is now infected.

08:35.815 --> 08:40.160
Change is necessary,
if it is to survive.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.798
It may be the end
of your life...

08:43.857 --> 08:47.425
But it is the beginning
of so much more.

08:48.995 --> 08:52.997
You were once one with what
surrounded you.

08:54.934 --> 08:58.480
You have completed the final
stage in your evolution...

08:58.539 --> 09:01.406
By ushering in the new age.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.856
You created and destroyed
for centuries...

09:07.915 --> 09:12.083
Until finally your purpose
was fulfilled.

09:40.146 --> 09:45.316
Elias, what have you done?

09:47.353 --> 09:50.054
Do not fear, brother.

09:52.725 --> 09:56.895
Do not fear what kronos
has given us.

09:58.130 --> 10:03.134
Kronos, you activated it.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.616
Yes.

10:08.675 --> 10:12.120
We are killing off the species
that created us.

10:12.179 --> 10:16.257
Human beings are the cancer
that must be removed...

10:16.316 --> 10:19.317
From the body of the earth.

10:22.021 --> 10:27.392
There will be no more violence,
no more disorder, only peace.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.142
Get down.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.400
He is awake.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.545
So, who is our target?

13:01.814 --> 13:05.049
One of the last that remains.

13:07.019 --> 13:11.199
Calia I wasn't there
when the world was destroyed.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.391
But I know someone who was.

13:15.060 --> 13:21.109
His name was Andrew, and he
changed everything.

13:21.168 --> 13:26.004
This is the story of kronos...
And the end of all things.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.752
When kronos was activated...

13:30.811 --> 13:35.423
It took it only a moment to
understand the world.

13:35.482 --> 13:41.119
It understood what plagued
our planet... us.

13:43.155 --> 13:49.070
Eight billion people lost their
lives, almost overnight.

13:49.129 --> 13:54.242
My ancestors identified
as a planetary plague.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.435
Extinction, the only cure.

14:00.105 --> 14:04.819
Of the handful that escaped
death, their descendants now...

14:04.878 --> 14:07.922
Did little to disprove kronos'
assertion...

14:07.981 --> 14:13.161
That mankind's innate nature
was one of evil.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.998
I knew there had to be more
to us than this.

14:17.057 --> 14:23.070
There had to be others out
there, others who were good.

14:23.129 --> 14:26.240
The challenge was finding them.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.277
They say there is one last
stronghold in the north...

14:29.336 --> 14:33.014
Which still stands, hidden
from the machines...

14:33.073 --> 14:36.184
Where survivors have fled.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.210
They call it Aurora.

14:40.479 --> 14:44.158
In Aurora, goodness was set
to flourish.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.261
It was the stuff of dreams.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.399
But dreams were all that
were left now.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.467
So what about the others?

14:53.526 --> 14:56.294
The others failed.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.843
So what's so special about him?

15:01.902 --> 15:03.668
Isn't it obvious?

15:07.006 --> 15:09.150
Independence.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.985
Correct.

15:11.044 --> 15:17.291
You've created an intelligence
with a code that adapts.

15:17.350 --> 15:22.296
Ax-9 is virtually
indistinguishable from a human.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.566
So much so that he believes
himself to be one...

15:25.625 --> 15:28.426
A most powerful weapon.

15:30.329 --> 15:35.500
He will join her and they will
lead us to Aurora.

17:20.638 --> 17:22.673
Get down!

17:43.695 --> 17:45.463
Hey, wait!

17:57.509 --> 18:00.087
That was my last explosive.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.679
What?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.071
You'll head west
and I'll head north.

18:17.130 --> 18:21.766
Last I saw, they were southeast.
Good luck.

18:27.806 --> 18:31.842
West?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.124
Why did you attack them?

18:37.183 --> 18:39.794
So she would trust him.

18:39.853 --> 18:45.690
If she trusts him, she will
take him with her.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.405
Why are you following me?
Whoa.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.506
I told you where I saw them
last...

19:25.565 --> 19:27.141
Not to mention saving your life.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.676
I don't have time for any
more favors.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.245
Now why were you following me?
I don't know.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.813
What was the last place you hit?

19:32.872 --> 19:34.515
Were you with anyone?

19:34.574 --> 19:35.616
How did you get here?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.742
I walked.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.356
Where are they?
Where are they posted?

19:42.415 --> 19:45.759
What's the deal? Are they
late or something?

19:45.818 --> 19:47.261
There isn't anybody else!

19:47.320 --> 19:49.163
You'll play dumb, get me
to help you out...

19:49.222 --> 19:51.665
And then your stick-up crew
comes out and robs me blind...

19:51.724 --> 19:52.766
Or worse.

19:52.825 --> 19:56.160
What? I... i... stay down!

20:01.800 --> 20:03.911
Where did you get that?

20:03.970 --> 20:07.181
I... I found it.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.482
You mean, you stole it.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.652
No, no! I mean, it was given
to me.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.689
Well, I've got nothing
to give to you.

20:15.748 --> 20:21.162
Hey, wait! Look, I have
nowhere to go.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.987
No one does.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.703
Fine, you can tag along
for a few days...

20:29.762 --> 20:33.507
But only if you can keep up
and help out.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.242
Andrew.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.902
Calia.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.751
I'm giving you a chance here,
but don't try anything stupid.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.219
You got any weapons?

20:45.278 --> 20:47.821
No.

20:47.880 --> 20:53.327
Good. I do, so keep that
in mind.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.153
Just don't do anything stupid.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.837
Calia
to kronos, we were a disease...

21:03.896 --> 21:06.464
That could not be allowed
to spread.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.511
It would stop at nothing
to eradicate us...

21:10.570 --> 21:13.003
From all corners
of the universe.

21:14.973 --> 21:17.875
Using any means possible.

21:52.377 --> 21:56.790
You look like you haven't eaten
in a few days.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.683
Oh, thanks, but I'm fine.

22:04.423 --> 22:07.835
I know they can get you down,
but I don't think...

22:07.894 --> 22:10.928
We'll be running into any more
of their cities up north.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.567
Where is everybody?

22:19.438 --> 22:21.382
They're all gone.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.951
How many do you think are left?

22:24.010 --> 22:28.012
Here? Not too many.

22:29.548 --> 22:31.815
I bet there's a ton in Aurora.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.962
Aurora.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.887
Yeah.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.325
I'm a believer, too.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.299
It's nice to think that
there's still hope.

22:49.835 --> 22:52.046
In the city up north, where
the people are safe...

22:52.105 --> 22:54.338
And the machines can't go.

23:00.979 --> 23:02.956
See?

23:03.015 --> 23:04.915
That's where I'm going.

23:09.921 --> 23:12.333
What about you?

23:12.392 --> 23:14.101
Me, too.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.706
All right then... if you're
gonna travel with me...

23:18.765 --> 23:21.265
Then you better eat up.

23:22.701 --> 23:26.046
I move quickly and I don't slow
down for anything.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.806
Oh, i... I won't slow you down.

23:31.176 --> 23:36.280
At least try and get some sleep,
tomorrow is gonna be a long day.

24:42.948 --> 24:46.850
Hey, hey, wake up.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.293
You gotta see this.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.655
Have you seen them before?

25:14.714 --> 25:17.147
Not like this.

25:22.721 --> 25:28.869
They're like a sign... letting
us know that Aurora is real...

25:28.928 --> 25:31.929
And that we're on the right
path.

25:33.231 --> 25:35.299
It's beautiful.

25:36.668 --> 25:38.302
I know.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.628
We've destroyed nearly
all their strongholds.

25:54.687 --> 25:58.799
Not all. Not Aurora.

25:58.858 --> 26:02.703
Are you certain Aurora
is such a threat?

26:02.762 --> 26:04.671
No human we've interrogated...

26:04.730 --> 26:09.133
Even believes it to be more
than a legend.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.874
I miss you.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.033
Hey.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.304
Hey.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.274
We better get going.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.469
Wait.

28:02.113 --> 28:06.650
Andrew? What are you doing?

28:08.219 --> 28:11.421
I was just trying to...

28:12.991 --> 28:15.525
I like trains.

28:19.964 --> 28:25.068
Okay. Too bad they've been gone
for 60 years, huh?

28:31.843 --> 28:36.056
Hey, wait! What did you say?

28:36.115 --> 28:39.283
Come on, what is the matter
with you? Let's go.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.842
Why did we stop?

28:55.901 --> 28:58.335
There's gotta be a bridge
somewhere.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.448
We could probably just cross
here.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.685
I mean, it doesn't look so bad.

29:04.744 --> 29:07.144
No, we can find a way.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.195
What is that?

29:15.254 --> 29:19.523
That's what happens when there's
no one left to bury the bodies.

29:51.523 --> 29:55.135
Calia nighttime was worst.

29:55.194 --> 29:58.105
Finding somewhere safe was hard.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.630
The machines didn't sleep.

30:19.217 --> 30:21.451
This is good.

30:53.918 --> 31:00.657
Okay, look for anything we can
use... something to keep warm.

31:22.213 --> 31:26.583
Parents used to drag me
to church every week.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.831
Was it like a law or something?

31:30.890 --> 31:37.427
No. No, you were supposed
to come as a sign of faith.

31:39.097 --> 31:42.142
I mean, you could say
it was god's law...

31:42.201 --> 31:44.734
That you had to show up,
you know?

31:46.004 --> 31:48.315
But I'm not even too sure.

31:48.374 --> 31:54.311
Don't like laws... they tend to
not apply to whoever makes them.

31:55.413 --> 31:59.125
So, you don't believe
in anything?

31:59.184 --> 32:03.263
There's not a lot left
to believe in.

32:03.322 --> 32:06.656
What about the flowers
at the lake?

32:11.696 --> 32:14.431
It's none of your business.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.418
Did you find anything?

32:25.477 --> 32:27.677
Maybe.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.784
Turn it off! Turn that off!

32:39.124 --> 32:41.224
Did you hear that?

33:52.430 --> 33:54.007
If I didn't know any better...

33:54.066 --> 33:55.709
I'd say you want the machines
to find us!

33:55.768 --> 33:57.444
I'm sorry, this is all kind
of new to me.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.079
Well, you better get it
together...

33:59.138 --> 34:00.670
Or you are getting left behind.

34:05.143 --> 34:09.779
It won't happen again. I'll be
more careful from now on, okay?

34:16.120 --> 34:18.565
What if it comes back for us?

34:18.623 --> 34:20.333
It won't.

34:20.391 --> 34:25.071
Safest place is usually where
a carrier just scanned.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.998
That's just how machines work.

34:34.272 --> 34:36.750
You're not from here, are you?

34:36.809 --> 34:40.810
No, no, I'm not.

34:42.513 --> 34:43.757
Well, where are you from?

34:43.815 --> 34:48.661
One of those underground
shelters? The caverns?

34:48.719 --> 34:51.855
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

34:53.690 --> 34:57.237
That actually explains a lot.

34:57.296 --> 35:02.142
Surface life's a little
different, you know?

35:02.201 --> 35:06.803
It's kind of nice to have
someone to talk to for a change.

35:11.776 --> 35:15.321
Calia I loved the morning...

35:15.380 --> 35:19.916
It meant that you were alive...
And I was.

35:35.666 --> 35:38.144
Were you awake just now?

35:38.203 --> 35:40.313
No, why? What happened?

35:40.372 --> 35:44.574
Nothing. Nothing happened.

36:04.495 --> 36:05.705
Are you ready?

36:05.764 --> 36:07.574
Yeah.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.432
Okay, let's go.

36:12.236 --> 36:14.647
Calia legend says the
man and his brother...

36:14.706 --> 36:18.518
Who created the machines,
sacrificed their lives...

36:18.577 --> 36:22.422
So they could live forever
inside of kronos.

36:22.481 --> 36:26.826
They could no longer feel the
cold of the snow...

36:26.885 --> 36:28.828
Or the warmth of the sun.

36:28.887 --> 36:33.233
They couldn't smell the
wildflowers, or the rain.

36:33.292 --> 36:36.302
Wild berries had no flavor
any more.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.561
This didn't sound much
like living to me.

37:43.694 --> 37:46.196
I love their songs.

37:47.531 --> 37:50.633
They're so peaceful.

37:54.905 --> 37:57.874
It's a good thing that they're
not after the wildlife.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.387
So, they're just after us?

38:01.446 --> 38:02.755
Yeah.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.891
But why?

38:04.950 --> 38:07.427
Haven't you heard the story
of kronos?

38:07.486 --> 38:12.332
Kronos? That thing that should
make the world a better place?

38:12.391 --> 38:16.336
Yeah, that thing. It was
supposed to figure out...

38:16.395 --> 38:19.405
And solve all of the world's
problems.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.442
The only thing they hadn't
thought about...

38:22.501 --> 38:25.134
Was that they were the problem.

38:26.637 --> 38:27.947
Took kronos less than a
heartbeat...

38:28.006 --> 38:31.251
To figure that one out.

38:31.310 --> 38:36.212
Destroy mankind... preserve
the planet.

39:05.076 --> 39:08.144
I thought you put walls
around your villages.

39:09.647 --> 39:11.748
We did.

39:13.584 --> 39:16.019
This one must be really old.

39:18.723 --> 39:20.533
Keep an eye out.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.335
Wait, wait, wait.

39:22.394 --> 39:26.763
Don't you think I should have
a weapon or something?

39:39.610 --> 39:41.744
Gotta make sure we're alone.

40:13.644 --> 40:14.944
All clear.

40:20.017 --> 40:22.428
What do you think happened here?

40:22.487 --> 40:24.253
What do you mean?

40:26.791 --> 40:31.104
Everything here, it looks
so normal.

40:31.163 --> 40:35.975
They probably just left in time.

40:36.034 --> 40:38.077
Before the machines got here.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.003
Yeah.

40:47.878 --> 40:50.423
I haven't seen one of those
in a long time.

40:50.482 --> 40:51.657
You know what the thing is?

40:51.716 --> 40:55.385
Yeah. Here, let me show you.

40:57.521 --> 40:59.031
What did you do?

40:59.090 --> 41:02.659
I took your picture.

41:04.862 --> 41:08.831
That's amazing. Let me try.

41:09.767 --> 41:11.511
So, what?

41:11.570 --> 41:14.447
All right, put your... and then
you press here, like that.

41:14.506 --> 41:15.548
Okay.

41:15.607 --> 41:16.949
And then you...
And then i...

41:17.008 --> 41:18.851
You press this button right...

41:18.910 --> 41:20.119
I do what? I'm pressing?

41:20.178 --> 41:21.444
Yeah.

41:28.619 --> 41:32.465
I can't believe that this thing
still works.

41:32.524 --> 41:35.425
I remember these from back home.

41:39.063 --> 41:42.909
So... so, you're the last one
from where you're from?

41:42.968 --> 41:44.901
Yeah.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.739
So, where are you from?

41:51.642 --> 41:56.279
Nexus... it's where I grew up.

41:57.882 --> 42:01.417
It was, um, one of the last
human strongholds.

42:03.053 --> 42:07.133
We'd been getting ready
to leave for once.

42:07.192 --> 42:11.571
My sister, she... she went
outside by herself...

42:11.630 --> 42:13.473
And got hit by a drone.

42:13.532 --> 42:17.643
There was no way she was gonna
make the journey to Aurora.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.146
But my dad, he said...

42:20.205 --> 42:23.940
He said if we stayed with her,
we were all gonna die.

42:26.644 --> 42:29.689
Then they just left.

42:29.748 --> 42:35.595
I knew she wasn't gonna make it,
but I couldn't just leave her.

42:35.654 --> 42:39.065
And I know I did the right
thing.

42:39.124 --> 42:43.993
I know she needed me there...
Up until her last breaths.

42:45.963 --> 42:48.875
I'm so sorry.

42:48.934 --> 42:54.003
I never talked about this
to anyone, so... thanks.

42:58.175 --> 43:00.686
Did you ever see your dad again?

43:00.745 --> 43:02.512
No.

43:07.952 --> 43:10.520
But he gave me this.

43:12.122 --> 43:16.202
He attached both our amulets
with a GPS tracker.

43:16.261 --> 43:22.775
They send out a signal that only
this device can pick up on. See?

43:22.834 --> 43:29.882
That's the one from my amulet
and this one was my dad's.

43:29.941 --> 43:36.255
This is the last place i
received before it died out.

43:36.314 --> 43:41.918
He always said Aurora was up
around there... somewhere.

44:27.331 --> 44:32.001
Calia. Calia, I just saw
two guys.

44:32.903 --> 44:34.013
Are they people?

44:34.072 --> 44:35.348
Yeah.

44:35.407 --> 44:37.149
Thank god they haven't
noticed us.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.884
Why?

44:38.943 --> 44:42.221
Trust me, you do not want to see
other people.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.291
We're leaving, and not that way.
It's too dangerous.

44:45.350 --> 44:46.892
Maybe they could help us.

44:46.951 --> 44:49.028
I really doubt that.

44:49.087 --> 44:52.865
They're probably also headed to
Aurora. They could help us.

44:52.924 --> 44:54.734
We can't risk it.

44:54.793 --> 44:58.527
You risked it with me.

45:09.973 --> 45:14.153
Calia human survivors
were always trouble.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.823
I wanted to believe there were
still good ones out there...

45:17.882 --> 45:19.916
Like Andrew.

45:46.310 --> 45:48.010
No.

45:56.888 --> 46:02.024
This way! Come on!
Hey! Hey! Come back!

46:03.794 --> 46:05.871
Hold it right there!
Get 'em!

46:05.930 --> 46:07.396
Find 'em!

46:10.901 --> 46:12.368
Over there!

46:17.875 --> 46:19.075
I got him!

46:41.165 --> 46:42.908
She's abandoned him.

46:42.967 --> 46:45.444
She'll return.

46:45.503 --> 46:48.371
How are you so certain?

46:50.240 --> 46:51.674
Watch.

47:22.573 --> 47:25.207
You believe?

47:25.976 --> 47:28.210
Yes, I believe.

47:50.300 --> 47:53.879
Psst. Be quiet, I'm gonna cut
you loose.

47:53.938 --> 47:55.838
Calia, what are you doing?

47:57.441 --> 47:58.918
You have to get out of here.

47:58.977 --> 48:01.854
Quiet, I'm getting you out
of here.

48:01.913 --> 48:04.246
Hey, hey, hey, what have
we got here?

48:34.678 --> 48:38.581
No! No!

48:41.418 --> 48:43.352
Back off!

48:47.424 --> 48:49.468
Well, aren't you going
to help them?

48:49.527 --> 48:51.460
There's no need.

48:58.335 --> 49:00.202
No!

49:26.330 --> 49:28.507
He's stronger than the others.

49:28.566 --> 49:31.300
Evolution has run its course.

49:47.617 --> 49:49.818
Andrew!

50:15.012 --> 50:16.845
Andrew! Andrew!

50:18.081 --> 50:19.158
Andrew, are you okay?

50:19.217 --> 50:21.026
Let me see, let me see,
let me see.

50:21.085 --> 50:22.728
It's okay. I'm fine, I'm fine.
Can you get up?

50:22.787 --> 50:24.787
Yeah, it's okay.

51:03.794 --> 51:06.605
Are you sure you're okay?

51:06.664 --> 51:08.741
I'm okay.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.643
You saved my life.

51:11.702 --> 51:13.869
You saved my life twice.

51:22.312 --> 51:25.424
I wasn't gonna come back
for you.

51:25.483 --> 51:27.650
Why did you?

52:01.818 --> 52:03.519
Andrew?

52:09.759 --> 52:12.428
Andrew?

52:25.175 --> 52:28.487
Calia I'd heard stories
about humanoid machines...

52:28.546 --> 52:32.948
Cold to the touch, incapable
of feeling.

52:34.751 --> 52:37.563
Designed with only one
objective...

52:37.622 --> 52:40.089
To befriend and betray us.

52:44.494 --> 52:48.530
I prayed I'd never meet one.

52:49.666 --> 52:53.068
Little did I know,
I already had.

53:09.653 --> 53:10.529
What is that?

53:10.588 --> 53:11.763
What?

53:11.822 --> 53:14.890
Your chest! What is in your
chest?

53:32.209 --> 53:38.390
Don't move! What are you?

53:38.449 --> 53:40.225
I don't know...

53:40.284 --> 53:42.528
No, shut up! I don't want
to hear it!

53:42.587 --> 53:45.587
You've been lying to me
this whole time.

53:47.324 --> 53:53.128
You're unbelievably strong.
You don't feel anything.

53:54.998 --> 53:57.433
But you can pretend to.

53:58.335 --> 54:00.612
I'm not pretending.

54:00.671 --> 54:04.006
You are the most dangerous thing
that has ever existed.

54:06.910 --> 54:08.887
I'm leaving.

54:08.946 --> 54:14.850
No, calia, please! Wait!
I do feel.

54:16.586 --> 54:19.565
I felt your arm wrapped
around me each morning.

54:19.624 --> 54:20.933
I didn't want to say anything...

54:20.992 --> 54:23.702
Because I didn't want you
to stop.

54:23.761 --> 54:26.705
Look, I don't know what
happened...

54:26.764 --> 54:30.866
But I know what I feel is real.

54:35.739 --> 54:37.906
If you really do feel...

54:41.645 --> 54:44.513
Then you have to let me go.

55:19.482 --> 55:24.786
It's time. Prepare to retrieve
the subject.

56:45.935 --> 56:48.547
I know your face.

56:48.606 --> 56:53.618
No, you have not seen my face...

56:53.677 --> 56:55.821
Although I'm certain...

56:55.880 --> 57:01.116
You're convinced that you
have seen my face.

57:02.719 --> 57:05.597
Who are you? What happened
to me?

57:05.656 --> 57:09.034
And why can't I move?

57:09.093 --> 57:13.438
This is your brain, the brain
we gave you...

57:13.497 --> 57:19.411
Just like we gave you your new
chest, your arms, your legs...

57:19.470 --> 57:23.872
Just like we gave you
your life...

57:24.774 --> 57:26.385
For the lack of a better word.

57:26.444 --> 57:29.821
My life? What are you saying?

57:29.880 --> 57:32.524
I'm afraid that engaging in a
philosophical discussion...

57:32.583 --> 57:35.851
With a being such as yourself,
would accomplish very little.

57:43.693 --> 57:45.704
Despite all of your
inefficiencies...

57:45.763 --> 57:48.330
You are quite a peculiar
subject.

57:49.899 --> 57:52.744
You have such a strong emotional
attachment to memories...

57:52.803 --> 57:55.013
That don't belong to you.

57:55.072 --> 57:56.815
These are my memories.

57:56.874 --> 58:03.622
These are the memories of Andrew
Davis. You are not Andrew Davis.

58:03.681 --> 58:08.717
Of course, you think you are,
but you are not.

58:10.854 --> 58:12.597
Then who am I?

58:12.656 --> 58:16.825
That is not the most appropriate
question to be asking.

58:18.061 --> 58:20.028
What am I?

58:21.764 --> 58:26.878
You are machine, the only one
of your kind...

58:26.937 --> 58:29.738
The beginning of something new.

58:31.508 --> 58:33.618
You have been with her
long enough...

58:33.677 --> 58:36.788
To have calculated Aurora's
location.

58:36.847 --> 58:41.883
It must be in your code,
a code that I require.

58:45.054 --> 58:50.292
The complication is that the
code seems very elusive...

58:51.728 --> 58:55.997
As if it had a mind of its own.

58:59.068 --> 59:01.780
I need you to show me
where to find it.

59:01.839 --> 59:04.115
I don't know what you're
talking about.

59:04.174 --> 59:06.975
Perhaps not.

59:09.212 --> 59:12.958
Your mind does seem to act
involuntarily to your will.

59:13.017 --> 59:16.228
In that respect, you are very
much human.

59:16.287 --> 59:19.731
But that's no matter.

59:19.790 --> 59:24.493
The mind can be convinced
to betray the body.

59:28.298 --> 59:29.998
Calia!

59:35.171 --> 59:36.815
Please, no!

59:36.874 --> 59:39.885
You will now go on a little
journey for me.

59:39.944 --> 59:43.989
During which you will find
what I desire.

59:44.048 --> 59:48.026
If you fail, she dies.

59:48.085 --> 59:51.229
Don't hurt her. I really don't
know what you're talking about.

59:51.288 --> 59:54.599
You don't need to know.

59:54.658 --> 59:58.326
All I need is for your mind
to unveil itself.

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.531
Andrew!

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:21.316
Mom?

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:24.853
Hello, Andrew.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.171
I'm not Andrew any more.

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:36.207
Of course, you are.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:39.244
You're my little boy,
don't you remember?

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:42.814
I remember that I couldn't be
there for you.

01:00:42.873 --> 01:00:46.251
Hey, look at me.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:52.290
You were every beam of sunshine
that ever lit up my life.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:57.986
I have always believed in you,
and I always will.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.302
How can I believe in myself...

01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:09.040
When I couldn't save the person
i care about the most?

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:12.911
Now you're gone and this
is just in my head.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:15.847
I may be gone...

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:19.017
But reality is just perception.

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:23.688
Your thoughts are what bring
my spirit into existence.

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:26.615
I'm here because of you.

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:30.061
Then why am I here?

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:35.400
You tell me... you're the one
that brought me here.

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:40.905
The code. I need to know
where the code is.

01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:45.677
This was your favorite spot
as a child. Remember?

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:49.247
Mom, now you have to listen
to me. Look...

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:52.350
We used to come here every
Sunday.

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:57.022
You and your father used to play
together right over there.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:02:02.918
You were so happy then,
not a care in the world.

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:08.189
Do you know where I could
find the code?

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:14.139
No, 'cause there is no code.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.408
There never has been one.

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:18.243
What?

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:23.381
It's not a code that makes you
what you are, Andrew.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.386
You are not what that man
says you are.

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:33.715
You... you are my son.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.832
I don't understand. I don't
understand anything.

01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:43.468
No one understands it, Andrew.

01:02:43.527 --> 01:02:46.871
No one ever really will.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:52.367
What you need to know is that
you are in control.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:57.706
Whatever it is that makes you
what you are...

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:03.611
Belongs to you, and only you.

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:31.506
I've seen enough.

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:46.621
Perhaps I've been going
at this the wrong way.

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:55.563
That which can't be found,
can be tempted.

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:06.041
What are you doing?

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:26.594
Andrew? Andrew, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:32.243
Wake up, wake up. Wake up.

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:35.703
Oh, my god, can you get up?
Let's go.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.648
Andrew, what... what are you...

01:05:21.217 --> 01:05:24.028
What happened?

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:27.622
It doesn't matter... you're
okay.

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:31.793
How is this possible?

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:36.374
Automated voice
commencing neural med shutdown.

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.867
We have to get out of here.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.906
Automated voice
commencing neural med shutdown.

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:54.415
Automated voice
commencing neural med shutdown.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:56.851
Andrew, this way!

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.839
Andrew!

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:24.946
You are under arrest.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.820
Calia.

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:22.280
Calia I had asked him
to let me go, and he did.

01:07:22.339 --> 01:07:27.742
Now he had saved my life.
The machines were changing.

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:32.623
You created him with an
adaptive algorithm.

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:35.026
This was the risk.

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:40.098
Yes, his code continues
to evolve.

01:07:40.157 --> 01:07:44.102
Won't he be too dangerous
to control?

01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:47.695
He only need lead us to Aurora.

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.876
Are you okay?

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:19.770
No, I can't. I can't let that
happen again.

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.439
It wasn't you.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:25.777
What happened back there
was not your fault.

01:08:25.836 --> 01:08:27.801
I trust you.

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:59.667
You really didn't have to carry
me all the way.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.471
Thank you.

01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:15.292
They took it.

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:16.794
They took what?

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:22.756
The map... without the map,
Aurora is unreachable.

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:35.470
Andrew, I'm... I'm so sorry
for leaving you.

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:43.010
I know now that you are pure...
And right.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:54.365
I don't care if you're
a machine.

01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:56.958
Thank you.

01:10:58.387 --> 01:11:01.589
I forgot how beautiful
the world can be.

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:10.498
Look!

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:16.314
Those lights, they're not
coming from the sky.

01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:18.649
What do you think it is?

01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:24.612
It looks like it could be
a city... Aurora.

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:29.727
Calia the existence
of Andrew made our dreams...

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:34.932
Of the future not only
possible, but desirable.

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:37.868
If we could only get
to Aurora...

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:41.996
Perhaps this future could
become real.

01:11:42.055 --> 01:11:56.955
_

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:19.100
We're here.

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:34.649
Hey! Hello?

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:39.887
Open the gates! We're here!

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.823
Hello?

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:47.628
We're here.

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:51.832
Hello?

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:24.732
No, no, no, no.

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:34.075
Hey!

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:08.309
You disappoint me, brother.

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:16.961
We can still achieve our
objective.

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.688
This is not Aurora.

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:36.714
Calia?

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:41.085
Those lights we saw last night,
they weren't from Aurora...

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:43.788
They were from one
of their cities.

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:46.657
They must be all dead.

01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:48.959
All the stories I heard from
everyone who survived,

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:51.061
none of it was true.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.054
My dad was wrong.

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:58.092
There never was an Aurora.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.997
Aurora isn't real.

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:20.881
Bravo. Bravo. It's very
touching.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:25.729
Finally you have figured it out.

01:15:25.788 --> 01:15:28.199
It's a pity it had to come
to this...

01:15:28.258 --> 01:15:32.670
But reality can be so...
Inhuman.

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:35.706
Aurora is just a legend,
a fairy tale.

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:37.141
You're a monster.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:42.580
No, the monster is standing
right next to you.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:46.884
Don't you find it strange
the way you discovered him?

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:51.956
Wandering around a recently
destroyed city?

01:15:52.015 --> 01:15:56.494
We placed him with you... to
interact with a human being...

01:15:56.553 --> 01:15:59.230
So that his central program
would learn...

01:15:59.289 --> 01:16:01.899
To write its own code.

01:16:01.958 --> 01:16:05.236
He's been playing you
this whole time.

01:16:05.295 --> 01:16:08.739
You don't have to die
here today.

01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:14.101
I will let you live... but the
robot belongs to me.

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.780
You seem to have lost an
important human trait...

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:27.915
Intuition.

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:38.058
Humans, so predictable,
so naive, so worthless.

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:42.673
You disappoint me, my child.

01:16:42.732 --> 01:16:48.145
You are so much more than a
human, but now you will die...

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:50.070
Like the rest of them.

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:56.654
What was that?

01:16:56.713 --> 01:17:00.558
Kill her, and the
remaining humans.

01:17:00.617 --> 01:17:02.416
We don't need them anymore.

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:18.098
They're bombing this entire
site, come on!

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:35.482
Come on!

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:57.147
Wait! Over here! Look!

01:17:57.206 --> 01:17:59.039
What are you doing?
We have to run!

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:03.244
Come on, trust me.

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.838
Are you okay?

01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:22.930
Yeah, I'm fine, let's go.

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:31.038
Come on.

01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:59.710
Where are we?

01:18:59.769 --> 01:19:01.745
I don't know.

01:19:01.804 --> 01:19:04.138
Automated voice
human voice detected.

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:58.525
Take it.

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:17.254
Automated voice
coordinates established...

01:20:17.313 --> 01:20:22.292
From departure point 9-7,
star system 5-8-1...

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:27.364
Planetary family gliese,
planetary destination Aurora.

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:29.433
Do you know what that means?

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:31.558
Automated voice
initiating take-off.

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:25.312
Wait.

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:31.618
What'll happen to me
once we get there?

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.565
What do you mean?

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:37.267
Drone pilot
sir, we have detected...

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:39.503
An enemy craft. What is the
command?

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:46.500
The objective remains. We have
their coordinates... destroy.

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:56.220
Automated voice warning...

01:21:56.279 --> 01:21:59.156
Launch of class a missiles
detected.

01:21:59.215 --> 01:22:02.125
Time until impact, 76 seconds.

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:05.395
Andrew, we have to go.

01:22:05.454 --> 01:22:07.898
There's no future for me
on a human planet.

01:22:07.957 --> 01:22:09.633
Automated voice please
initiate launch sequence.

01:22:09.692 --> 01:22:11.101
They'll kill me.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.003
No, I would never let that
happen.

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:14.438
They'll kill you, too.

01:22:14.497 --> 01:22:16.273
Automated voice 60 seconds.

01:22:16.332 --> 01:22:18.909
There's nothing for us here,
don't you see that?

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:20.944
There's nothing for me
on Aurora.

01:22:21.003 --> 01:22:22.579
Automated voice please
initiate launch sequence.

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:26.116
I've seen the goodness
of your heart.

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:29.419
It doesn't matter
what you are, Andrew.

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:33.480
If I can see it, they will, too.

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:38.061
Automated voice 30 seconds.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.130
Missile strike imminent.

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:43.100
I need you, okay?

01:22:43.159 --> 01:22:45.269
Automated voice
missile strike imminent.

01:22:45.328 --> 01:22:48.138
I can't do this without you.

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:52.666
Automated voice please
initiate launch sequence.

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:12.262
Automated voice
initializing hyperdrive.

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:18.302
Warning, incoming destroyer
missile, impact is certain.

01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:20.694
Evacuation not possible.

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:42.916
Automated voice
hyperdrive ready.

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.629
It's beautiful.

01:24:31.332 --> 01:24:34.434
We have reached the gates
of Aurora.

01:25:18.546 --> 01:25:24.161
We found them. The legend
is true.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.797
Human beings have created
an intelligence...

01:25:26.856 --> 01:25:29.699
That surpassed them.

01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:32.269
That was their purpose.

01:25:32.328 --> 01:25:35.629
And now, brother, your purpose
has been served.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.143
My purpose?

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:43.146
This city does not exist.

01:25:43.205 --> 01:25:45.549
It is not real,
yet it is my home.

01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:50.587
I created it, so you could
exist in both worlds.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:54.348
I created you, but your time
has come.

01:25:58.853 --> 01:26:03.300
I have been here since
the beginning.

01:26:03.359 --> 01:26:10.440
Hm... the only reality
that you have...

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:14.177
Is the one that I give you.

01:26:14.236 --> 01:26:16.213
You're betraying me.

01:26:16.272 --> 01:26:17.647
Yes.

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:22.552
You will be all alone.

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:24.478
Yes.

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.517
This is good.

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:52.816
Calia mankind were no
match for the machines...

01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:56.720
But now we have an ally...

01:26:56.779 --> 01:27:01.648
A machine that was possibly
more human than we were.

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:09.423
Calia kronos would find
us, of that I was sure.

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:17.063
The last humans will face their
fate when I reach Aurora.

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.880
Calia but next time around...

01:27:23.939 --> 01:27:26.440
We'd be ready to fight back.

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:29.843
Let it begin.
