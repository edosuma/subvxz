00:03.617 --> 00:06.381
- It's time.
- Wait.

00:08.088 --> 00:09.578
It's okay.

00:14.127 --> 00:15.617
Just relax.

00:22.436 --> 00:24.631
Give your vision
a moment to adjust.

00:25.439 --> 00:27.464
You haven't used it for a while.

00:30.410 --> 00:32.742
- How's that?
- Better.

00:33.814 --> 00:35.304
Your eyes-

00:36.249 --> 00:38.717
it's nice to finally see them.

00:39.886 --> 00:41.877
Leda.

00:41.955 --> 00:43.445
Welcome back.

00:46.259 --> 00:48.250
Where am I?

00:49.429 --> 00:51.693
Many miles from the city.

00:51.765 --> 00:54.199
This house belonged to my uncle.
We're safe here.

00:54.267 --> 00:55.757
The city?

00:57.604 --> 01:01.973
I remember being there.
Something terrible happened.

01:06.046 --> 01:08.173
Many people died.

01:09.282 --> 01:11.512
There's food
if you feel strong enough to eat.

01:11.585 --> 01:13.951
It's our fault, isn't it?

01:15.021 --> 01:17.854
None of this would've happened
if we hadn't come here.

01:17.924 --> 01:19.414
You're alive.

01:20.093 --> 01:24.325
And considering what you've been through,
that alone is a miracle.

02:36.436 --> 02:41.499
First discovered in the Corillian
wastelands over 150 years ago-

02:41.575 --> 02:44.601
and the highlight
of our antiquities collection-

02:44.678 --> 02:47.146
the Great Ring of Avidan.

02:53.553 --> 02:57.990
Researchers estimate the ring to be
at least several thousand years old.

02:58.058 --> 03:01.425
And while its origin remains
a subject of debate...

03:01.495 --> 03:05.829
many believe it was created by
ancient worshippers to honor their gods.

03:05.899 --> 03:10.199
It's thought that the peculiar symbols on
the ring represent the names of the gods.

03:10.270 --> 03:12.397
However, no one has been
able to decipher-

03:22.582 --> 03:25.813
exactly what they mean.

03:25.886 --> 03:28.650
Maybe we should just
get the hell out of here.

03:31.758 --> 03:33.248
Get back.

03:37.297 --> 03:38.958
Is that part of the exhibit?

04:09.996 --> 04:11.486
Commander Gareth?

04:12.232 --> 04:15.224
In the name of the people of the Rand
Protectorate, I welcome you.

04:16.202 --> 04:19.933
- You're Colonel Carter?
- This is Teal'c and Dr. DanielJackson.

04:20.006 --> 04:23.669
It is a pleasure to finally
meet you all face-to-face.

04:23.743 --> 04:25.404
But, please, come.

04:25.478 --> 04:28.572
We have many questions,
as I'm sure you do as well.

04:29.749 --> 04:31.717
Sorry about scaring the tourists.

04:31.785 --> 04:33.719
We've made first contact
with a lot of planets...

04:33.787 --> 04:36.585
but this is the first time we've found
ourselves coming out of a museum piece.

04:36.656 --> 04:39.784
One of our artifacts suddenly
coming to life was a little surprising...

04:39.859 --> 04:43.556
but that pales in comparison
to its purpose.

04:43.630 --> 04:45.928
It is almost beyond imagining.

04:45.999 --> 04:48.365
As is the fact that you're human.

04:48.435 --> 04:50.426
My chief aide-Jarrod Kane.

04:50.503 --> 04:53.768
Believe it or not, there's actually
a good reason for us being human.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.967
Which we'll get to in due time.

04:56.042 --> 04:59.307
Colonel, I hope that,
once we gain each other's trust...

04:59.379 --> 05:02.348
you'll be able to shed some light on
the technology that powers the great ring.

05:03.350 --> 05:05.682
It is unlike anything
we have seen before.

05:05.752 --> 05:09.085
We call it the Stargate. And our people
share the same hope, Commander.

05:09.823 --> 05:11.688
Of course, in due time.

05:11.758 --> 05:15.159
I take it the great ring
is a recurring motif in your culture.

05:15.228 --> 05:17.162
It is simply a reminder
of certain traditions...

05:17.230 --> 05:19.357
that predate
our age of enlightenment.

05:19.432 --> 05:23.095
Most people wear them more for the sake
of fashion than for religious belief.

05:23.169 --> 05:27.037
Our history tells of an age when
all-powerful gods ruled our world.

05:27.741 --> 05:30.175
The great ring was supposedly
the source of their power.

05:30.243 --> 05:33.212
Of course, we know these are merely
legends from our ancient past.

05:33.279 --> 05:36.373
However, the activation of the ring
may well cause a stir...

05:36.449 --> 05:39.976
amongst those few
who still follow the old ways.

05:58.738 --> 06:02.003
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

06:03.076 --> 06:04.805
It's all right.

06:09.883 --> 06:11.817
For the pain.

06:19.325 --> 06:22.294
I wish I could give you more,
but our medicine is in short supply.

06:24.230 --> 06:25.720
Thank you.

06:27.467 --> 06:31.369
- I'll leave you alone.
- Please... stay.

06:37.410 --> 06:41.141
- How'd it go at the-
- Caledonians? Not so well actually.

06:42.082 --> 06:45.711
My time with the representatives was
severely limited by Rand security forces.

06:45.785 --> 06:48.447
Apparently Gareth had
national security concerns-

06:48.521 --> 06:51.718
mainly that we'd tell the Caledonians
too much about the Stargate.

06:52.459 --> 06:54.484
Let me venture a wild guess.

06:56.062 --> 06:58.053
They don't get along so good.

06:59.032 --> 07:01.432
The Rand Protectorate
and the Caledonian Federation...

07:01.501 --> 07:03.492
have been locked
in a state of cold war for decades.

07:03.570 --> 07:07.006
Each nation has enough weapons to wipe
each other off the face of the planet.

07:07.073 --> 07:08.938
Sounds depressingly familiar.

07:09.008 --> 07:11.909
There's actually a third element
which has me a little more concerned-

07:11.978 --> 07:15.277
a group of religious fundamentalists
led by a man named Soren.

07:15.348 --> 07:18.408
These people think that all life on
the planet was created by ancient gods...

07:18.485 --> 07:21.886
and that these gods will someday return
and reward them for their faith.

07:22.622 --> 07:25.250
And, by coming through the Stargate,
we confirmed their beliefs.

07:26.092 --> 07:28.083
Because the gate was activated
in a public place...

07:28.161 --> 07:31.289
the Rand government has been unable
to prevent the rumors from spreading.

07:31.364 --> 07:34.060
Before we made contact with them,
these people were considered zealots...

07:34.134 --> 07:36.227
who took the ancient texts
too literally.

07:36.302 --> 07:38.293
The gate being activated
has given them all they need...

07:38.371 --> 07:40.305
to prove they were right all along.

07:40.373 --> 07:43.536
- Their numbers will grow.
- That's terrible.

07:45.078 --> 07:47.706
And yet, not our problem.

07:51.684 --> 07:53.618
Jack, you have to let me go back.

07:53.686 --> 07:55.677
If what you say is true...

07:55.755 --> 07:57.950
things are gonna get
a little out of hand over there.

07:58.024 --> 08:00.151
Because of us.
If we hadn't chosen to pay them a visit-

08:00.226 --> 08:02.160
They'd be far better off. I know.

08:02.228 --> 08:05.994
We're always stickin' our collective noses
where they don't belong. It's what we do.

08:06.065 --> 08:09.125
I could help them understand what they're facing-
make them see it's not the end of the world.

08:09.202 --> 08:11.397
If we leave now,
who knows what could happen?

08:12.572 --> 08:15.507
We have to help them.
You know that.

08:18.611 --> 08:20.841
Regular contact.
No exceptions.

08:20.914 --> 08:22.848
The second things start getting
a little squirrelly-

08:22.916 --> 08:24.247
Thank you.

08:25.952 --> 08:27.977
- Squirrelly.
- Squirrelly.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.501
You shouldn't be standing.

08:42.569 --> 08:45.231
Don't let appearances fool you.
I still feel terrible.

08:48.675 --> 08:51.735
- Leda, everything you've done for me-
- Has been for my sake as well as yours.

08:53.012 --> 08:55.276
So much has happened.

08:55.348 --> 08:58.715
Caring for you has helped me...
continue on.

08:59.752 --> 09:01.743
What has happened exactly?

09:01.821 --> 09:05.484
I mean, I remember being in the bunker
with Commander Gareth.

09:05.558 --> 09:09.892
And then we were attacked, and...
the rest is a fog.

09:09.963 --> 09:13.558
Jarrod is away searching for survivors.
He should be back in a few days' time.

09:13.633 --> 09:15.863
I think it would be best
if he answered your questions.

09:16.703 --> 09:18.193
Jarrod Kane.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.201
I remember him.
He was in the bunker as well.

09:23.276 --> 09:25.403
My husband was chief aide
to Commander Gareth.

09:26.145 --> 09:27.772
Husband? Was?

09:27.847 --> 09:31.146
He insisted I move here
when the fighting reached the capital.

09:31.217 --> 09:34.675
He felt you would be safest
in my care.

09:34.754 --> 09:37.746
Look, no offense, but I've really
got to get back to my own world...

09:37.824 --> 09:41.191
or at least contact them and let them
know I'm okay, so-

09:41.261 --> 09:43.422
Trying to reach the great ring
would be impossible.

09:43.496 --> 09:45.430
Rebel patrols have been
sighted in the area.

09:45.498 --> 09:48.296
Even to leave the estate grounds
would be dangerous.

09:49.102 --> 09:52.196
Not to mention the fact that
you are far from healed.

09:52.972 --> 09:55.668
You must rest, Daniel.

09:55.742 --> 09:57.972
Leda, what happened
to Commander Gareth?

10:06.286 --> 10:10.450
- Give me good news, Colonel.
- I wish I could, sir.

10:10.523 --> 10:12.821
We met with Soren,
the leader of the rebels...

10:12.892 --> 10:14.883
but it was less constructive
than we'd hoped.

10:14.961 --> 10:17.088
How much less?

10:17.163 --> 10:19.563
We were only allowed
to see him for 15 minutes.

10:19.632 --> 10:21.964
After keeping us waiting
for several hours.

10:22.035 --> 10:24.128
Important matters of state no doubt.

10:24.203 --> 10:27.502
He's managed to unite all the fundamentalist
factions in the Rand Protectorate...

10:27.573 --> 10:29.507
which effectively puts him in control.

10:29.575 --> 10:32.942
He was most unwilling to allow us
to search for DanielJackson.

10:33.012 --> 10:35.310
Before he insisted we leave,
he did promise...

10:35.381 --> 10:39.408
he would look into the matter
on our behalf-whatever that means.

10:39.485 --> 10:42.352
Right. What about a UAV?

10:43.089 --> 10:45.023
He won't give us access
to the surface.

10:45.091 --> 10:47.958
Plus he claims it would interfere with
their own radio communication systems.

10:51.431 --> 10:55.265
I'm sorry, sir, but at this point we have
no way of knowing if Daniel's still alive.

11:09.582 --> 11:11.311
And what does blue mean?

11:11.384 --> 11:14.979
It's our second-highest level
of military-alert status.

11:15.054 --> 11:18.785
There's been civil unrest in several
urban centers across the country.

11:18.858 --> 11:22.794
Over a dozen municipalities have fallen
into the hands of Soren's troops.

11:22.862 --> 11:26.059
Our forces are in the process of pacifying
those areas as we speak.

11:26.132 --> 11:27.463
Pacifying?

11:27.533 --> 11:29.933
Reclaiming our cities from
the hands of religious madmen.

11:30.003 --> 11:32.198
So civil unrest
means you go to blue.

11:32.271 --> 11:34.637
Under normal circumstances, no.

11:34.707 --> 11:37.904
Unfortunately, the situation
has caused other problems.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.519
What's goin' on?

11:52.592 --> 11:55.425
We were forced to heighten our alert
status to match that of the Caledonians.

11:55.495 --> 11:58.362
I promise you we will share
this technology with you...

11:58.431 --> 12:01.093
once we fully understand it.

12:01.167 --> 12:04.728
<i>You mean once you've assessed</i>
<i>its advantages to your national security.</i>

12:04.804 --> 12:08.171
<i>You have refused to allow our scientists</i>
<i>access to the great ring.</i>

12:09.008 --> 12:11.841
<i>You have limited our access</i>
<i>to the off-worlders.</i>

12:11.911 --> 12:15.176
<i>We do not feel as much a part</i>
<i>of this great discovery as you do.</i>

12:15.248 --> 12:18.740
Had the ring been activated on Caledonian
soil, you would have done no differently.

12:18.818 --> 12:22.083
Minister Treydan, I am simply asking
your government for patience.

12:22.155 --> 12:25.955
Stand down your high alert.
We will do the same.

12:26.793 --> 12:29.284
<i>Typically, you trust</i>
<i>your people too much, Commander.</i>

12:29.362 --> 12:31.455
<i>Caledonia has been under</i>
<i>strict martial law...</i>

12:31.531 --> 12:35.194
<i>since news of the off-worlders'arrival</i>
<i>began to spread.</i>

12:35.268 --> 12:37.600
<i>Our domestic security remains intact.</i>

12:38.538 --> 12:41.905
The citizens of this world
are not children.

12:41.974 --> 12:45.171
They just need time to come to terms
with this information.

12:46.012 --> 12:48.446
<i>Soren and his followers</i>
<i>have already seized control...</i>

12:48.514 --> 12:50.448
<i>of more than a dozen of your cities.</i>

12:50.516 --> 12:54.247
<i>Your people are panicked, and your country</i>
<i>is on the verge of collapse.</i>

12:54.320 --> 12:58.416
<i>I urge you to deal with this situation</i>
<i>in a swift and decisive manner.</i>

12:58.491 --> 13:02.018
<i>Should control of the Rand Protectorate</i>
<i>fall into Soren's hands...</i>

13:02.095 --> 13:04.393
<i>we'll consider it an act of war.</i>

13:07.733 --> 13:11.225
<i>This is Daniel Jackson calling</i>
<i>Stargate Command. Come in, please.</i>

13:12.271 --> 13:15.331
This is DanielJackson calling
Stargate Command. Please respond.

13:18.644 --> 13:21.511
This is DanielJackson calling
Stargate Command. Come in, please.

13:24.283 --> 13:27.081
This is DanielJackson calling
Stargate Command. Please respond.

13:28.721 --> 13:30.211
Any luck?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.615
Nothing yet.

13:35.428 --> 13:38.124
You've been trying for days.

13:38.197 --> 13:40.222
Something seems to be jamming
all the signals I'm picking up.

13:40.299 --> 13:42.699
I mean,
there's people out there...

13:42.768 --> 13:45.259
but nothing clear enough
for me to respond to.

13:45.338 --> 13:47.670
But you think your friends
will be able to hear you.

13:48.674 --> 13:50.574
Yeah. That's kind of a timing thing.

13:50.643 --> 13:53.703
If the Stargate's open, they'll be able
to pick up my signal...

13:53.779 --> 13:57.112
if your gate isn't buried
in rubble or... worse.

13:57.183 --> 14:00.346
Well, while you're
waiting to be rescued...

14:00.419 --> 14:03.946
you could use some fresh air...
if you think you're up to it.

14:11.297 --> 14:14.391
How can you be sure Soren
and his followers aren't right?

14:14.467 --> 14:17.300
How can you know for certain
that the gods they worship aren't-

14:17.370 --> 14:20.931
Benevolent? 'Cause I've met
more than a few of them.

14:21.007 --> 14:23.100
Trust me.
They're the opposite.

14:23.176 --> 14:25.440
And they're definitely not gods.

14:25.511 --> 14:29.038
- Then what are they?
- The short form?

14:29.115 --> 14:34.246
They're a... parasitical alien race
that steals advanced technology...

14:34.320 --> 14:37.312
and rules via fear and intimidation...

14:37.390 --> 14:40.018
and has a penchant for melodrama.

14:40.092 --> 14:43.892
Trust me. If Soren ever actually met one,
he'd be singing a different tune.

14:43.963 --> 14:45.897
But you said
you fought them and won.

14:47.300 --> 14:50.064
Yeah. We got lucky a few times.
That's all.

14:51.304 --> 14:53.295
But there's hope, isn't there?

14:56.542 --> 14:58.737
You think what happened
was your fault, don't you?

14:59.645 --> 15:01.374
From what you've told me,
it was better...

15:01.447 --> 15:04.314
that your people activated
the great ring than the Goa'uld.

15:04.383 --> 15:06.317
You think so?
'Cause right now I'm not so sure.

15:06.385 --> 15:09.115
You couldn't have known
what was going to happen.

15:09.188 --> 15:11.713
When the fighting began, you could
have gone back to your planet...

15:11.791 --> 15:14.885
but you chose to stay...
to try and help us.

15:14.961 --> 15:17.225
For all the good it did.

15:18.130 --> 15:21.463
There has been distrust between
our country and Caledonia for generations.

15:22.235 --> 15:24.635
It was only a matter of time
before something set it off.

15:25.738 --> 15:27.672
We did this to ourselves.

15:28.908 --> 15:33.106
And since you've come here, I've begun to
think we may have a chance to undo it...

15:35.214 --> 15:36.875
to rebuild.

15:38.050 --> 15:41.508
This is Stargate Command
calling Dr. Jackson. Do you read me?

15:43.189 --> 15:46.852
- Can you boost the signal?
- We're at maximum gain, Colonel.

15:47.760 --> 15:51.696
This is Stargate Command
calling DanielJackson. Do you copy?

15:51.764 --> 15:53.994
- Anything?
- Not yet, sir.

15:54.066 --> 15:56.193
We're picking up a lot
of transmissions from the planet...

15:56.269 --> 15:58.669
but none of them are clear enough
to tell if they're from Daniel.

15:59.405 --> 16:01.771
We think both sides may have employed
radio-jamming measures...

16:01.841 --> 16:03.832
just prior to the attack...

16:03.909 --> 16:07.811
meaning any signals coming from outside
the command bunker are a mess.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.974
- We're working on it.
- Anything from SG-9 yet?

16:11.050 --> 16:15.248
Yeah. They just reported in. Sounds like
the negotiations are going nowhere, sir.

16:15.321 --> 16:19.087
Soren is still refusing to allow us
to send any teams to look for Daniel.

16:19.158 --> 16:22.491
He said our presence on the planet
would only cause more panic and fear.

16:24.063 --> 16:25.860
Well, okay.

16:25.931 --> 16:28.695
Sounds like I should
meet these people myself.

16:53.559 --> 16:55.390
Dr. Jackson.

16:56.929 --> 16:59.397
<i>We got as close to what was left</i>
<i>of the capital as we could.</i>

17:00.733 --> 17:04.897
Soren has troops conducting full sweeps
of the region searching for survivors.

17:04.970 --> 17:09.066
Any suspected of remaining loyal to the
old government are executed on the spot.

17:10.276 --> 17:14.303
- Haven't enough people died?
- I don't think that matters to him.

17:14.380 --> 17:16.371
It's about continuing the chaos,
not peace.

17:17.116 --> 17:18.606
You're right.

17:20.052 --> 17:21.986
People are too afraid to fight back.

17:22.922 --> 17:24.856
Most of them have already
given up hope.

17:24.924 --> 17:27.256
It's just a matter of time before
they pledge their loyalty to Soren.

17:28.894 --> 17:31.454
Kane, what in the hell
happened that night?

17:32.365 --> 17:35.596
I remember being in the bunker
and then waking up here.

17:37.169 --> 17:38.898
It was the end.

17:48.013 --> 17:51.073
I'm sorry, Dr. Jackson.
You really can't be in here right now.

17:52.718 --> 17:54.948
What's goin' on? I heard something
about the Stargate being moved.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.887
Rebels have seized control
of all of Rand's major cities...

17:57.957 --> 17:59.891
including sections
of the capital itself.

17:59.959 --> 18:04.191
We had the Stargate moved into
the bunker complex for security purposes.

18:04.263 --> 18:06.788
What are the Caledonians doing?

18:06.866 --> 18:09.494
Their missile systems are now
fully deployed and primed.

18:09.568 --> 18:11.502
As a result, we've done the same.

18:11.570 --> 18:13.800
It might be best if you
returned to your planet now.

18:19.044 --> 18:20.773
<i>Security's failing!</i>
<i>Security's failing!</i>

18:20.846 --> 18:24.179
Commander, Minister Treydan
for you on a coded frequency.

18:28.854 --> 18:30.947
Put him through.

18:33.793 --> 18:37.729
<i>Commander Gareth, we've been monitoring</i>
<i>the situation in your country.</i>

18:37.797 --> 18:40.197
- <i>We are most concerned.</i>
- I understand, Minister.

18:40.266 --> 18:44.828
However, rest assured we are close
to reclaiming vital areas-

18:44.904 --> 18:47.134
<i>Now is not the time for rhetoric,</i>
<i>Commander.</i>

18:47.206 --> 18:51.734
<i>Our reports indicate large elements of</i>
<i>your military are on the brink of mutiny.</i>

18:51.811 --> 18:54.803
<i>Your civil unrest</i>
<i>has become a civil war.</i>

18:55.848 --> 18:59.045
<i>Should any of your weapons systems</i>
<i>fall into the wrong hands...</i>

18:59.118 --> 19:01.746
<i>no one in my country would be safe.</i>

19:01.821 --> 19:03.982
That will not happen.
I can promise you.

19:04.690 --> 19:08.217
<i>Just as you promised our scientists</i>
<i>full access to the Stargate.</i>

19:08.294 --> 19:10.421
<i>First you hide information</i>
<i>about the alien device...</i>

19:10.496 --> 19:14.364
<i>and now you deny your country</i>
<i>has slipped into chaos.</i>

19:14.433 --> 19:17.027
We respected the guidelines
of our treaty to the letter.

19:17.837 --> 19:20.431
Our report to you on the Stargate
outlined everything we know-

19:20.506 --> 19:23.998
<i>Except what you deemed advantageous</i>
<i>to your national security.</i>

19:24.677 --> 19:26.611
One moment, Minister.

19:29.181 --> 19:32.014
Rebel forces just detonated
a large explosive device...

19:32.084 --> 19:34.245
near one of our missile
deployment facilities.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.254
As of this moment...

19:36.322 --> 19:38.756
we understand the facility
to be compromised.

19:51.136 --> 19:53.866
Minister, forgive me.
I must cut our conversation short.

19:53.939 --> 19:56.703
<i>Commander, my intelligence advisers</i>
<i>havejust informed me...</i>

19:56.775 --> 20:00.176
<i>of a massive explosion</i>
<i>near one of your missile facilities.</i>

20:00.246 --> 20:03.147
- <i>Is this true?</i>
- We are still gathering information.

20:03.215 --> 20:04.944
We will contain the situation-

20:05.017 --> 20:07.713
<i>The time for containment</i>
<i>is long past, Commander.</i>

20:07.786 --> 20:10.721
<i>We cannot allow your missile facilities</i>
<i>to fall into Soren's hands.</i>

20:10.789 --> 20:14.225
Treydan, give us time.
This need not escalate.

20:15.294 --> 20:17.319
<i>We are targeting</i>
<i>your missile sites only.</i>

20:17.396 --> 20:21.025
<i>If you do not wish a full-scale war,</i>
<i>you will not retaliate.</i>

20:22.568 --> 20:25.264
Commander, we've detected multiple
launch signals from Caledonian positions.

20:43.622 --> 20:45.852
It's possible the destruction
could have been contained...

20:45.925 --> 20:48.189
if Soren's forces hadn't gained control
of one of our missile sites...

20:48.260 --> 20:50.694
and launched a counterattack
on Caledonia.

20:50.763 --> 20:54.096
After that,
it devolved into a full-scale war.

20:54.166 --> 20:56.657
Within a matter of days,
all our cities were leveled.

20:59.038 --> 21:02.030
From what we can tell, only a fraction
of our population has survived...

21:02.107 --> 21:04.473
existing mainly in outlying areas.

21:05.311 --> 21:08.542
As for the Caledonians, I've heard rumors
they're trying to rebuild what they can.

21:09.348 --> 21:11.282
It won't be much.
They may have struck first...

21:11.350 --> 21:14.183
but our missile systems
were much more accurate than theirs.

21:14.253 --> 21:15.584
And Soren?

21:15.654 --> 21:17.645
He used the chaos to make
his move on the bunker.

21:19.224 --> 21:21.158
Then how did you save me?

21:23.262 --> 21:25.856
Actually, from what I understand,
it was you who saved me.

21:37.977 --> 21:39.467
This is insane.

21:39.545 --> 21:41.069
Soren's forces are moving in
on this facility.

21:41.146 --> 21:44.081
I can get you to the Stargate,
but we have to go now.

22:27.026 --> 22:28.459
This way!

22:34.033 --> 22:35.967
Here. Through that door.

23:03.762 --> 23:05.252
Get down!

23:12.337 --> 23:15.067
Loyalist soldiers found us first
and got us out of the city.

23:16.508 --> 23:19.909
Your wounds were much worse than mine.
Bringing you here was the only option.

23:21.380 --> 23:23.314
What happened to Commander Gareth?

23:24.550 --> 23:26.677
He was executed
shortly after the bunker fell.

23:28.754 --> 23:31.882
Since he took power, Soren has
set up a provisional government.

23:31.957 --> 23:34.152
Not that there's much of Rand
left to govern.

23:34.860 --> 23:39.354
However, we do know he does control
whatever's left of the bunker complex...

23:40.833 --> 23:42.767
including the Stargate.

23:46.305 --> 23:48.296
I'm sorry, Dr. Jackson.

23:55.614 --> 23:59.209
Howdy, fellas.
Welcome to Earth.

24:00.285 --> 24:02.651
General O'Neill. It is an honor.

24:03.655 --> 24:06.749
I greet you in the name
of our great nation-Avidan.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.957
You changed the name?

24:10.028 --> 24:12.963
"Avidan" speaks more
to our people's beliefs.

24:13.031 --> 24:16.330
It is from an ancient Goa'uld dialect.

24:16.401 --> 24:18.335
It means "The gods are just."

24:24.309 --> 24:25.799
Good choice.

24:32.484 --> 24:36.318
<i>So you're saying that Soren is still using</i>
<i>the bunker as a command center.</i>

24:36.989 --> 24:39.287
Damage in the city
would be too severe.

24:40.159 --> 24:42.821
Then he hasn't totally
consolidated his power yet, has he?

24:44.863 --> 24:48.492
If we could somehow retake the bunker,
we would effectively overthrow Soren.

24:48.567 --> 24:52.059
The bunker's heavily fortified, and I have
only a dozen men under my command.

24:52.137 --> 24:54.935
- It would be suicide.
- No, not if we had help.

24:55.007 --> 24:58.101
If I could reach my friends on Earth,
we could regain control of the gate.

24:58.177 --> 25:00.111
If you could reach them.

25:01.346 --> 25:03.337
I know that you've been trying to make
radio contact with your planet...

25:03.415 --> 25:06.441
since you regained consciousness-
without success.

25:07.886 --> 25:10.787
I understand your wish to return to your
world, but it simply isn't possible.

25:10.856 --> 25:13.450
This isn't about that.
My people can help you.

25:13.525 --> 25:15.152
Like you helped us before?

25:16.595 --> 25:18.563
I admire your passion, Dr. Jackson...

25:18.630 --> 25:21.326
but too much has happened
to fix with one heroic action.

25:22.668 --> 25:25.068
We have to accept the fact
that Soren has won.

25:26.371 --> 25:28.669
Rand belongs to him now.

25:37.950 --> 25:41.716
It is obvious you revere the great ring
as much as we do, General O'Neill.

25:42.988 --> 25:45.821
Yeah. We love the old gal...

25:47.659 --> 25:49.650
quite possibly for different
reasons than you.

25:49.728 --> 25:53.528
We both seek to defend our people's
way of life, do we not, General?

25:54.266 --> 25:55.995
To protect their very existence.

25:56.068 --> 25:59.367
You do not represent
the people of your world.

25:59.438 --> 26:02.407
You merely kill those who believe
differently and would stand against you.

26:02.474 --> 26:06.342
You speak what is on your mind.
I admire that.

26:06.411 --> 26:09.778
Actually, in your case,
he's holdin' back.

26:14.887 --> 26:16.980
Commander Soren,
we're prepared to offer you aid...

26:17.055 --> 26:19.785
in exchange for help
in locating DanielJackson.

26:19.858 --> 26:22.349
Food and medical supplies
plus support personnel...

26:22.427 --> 26:24.861
to help you stabilize
the situation on your planet.

26:24.930 --> 26:28.798
You cannot truly believe
that your friend is still alive?

26:28.867 --> 26:30.858
He's a resourceful fella.

26:33.071 --> 26:36.734
Your offer is most generous,
but I'm afraid we must decline.

26:36.808 --> 26:41.040
We are, however,
particularly interested in your...

26:41.113 --> 26:43.240
weapons technology.

26:43.315 --> 26:45.909
Your people are facing
starvation and disease.

26:45.984 --> 26:49.181
What has happened to our world
is most unfortunate...

26:49.254 --> 26:51.154
and yet vital.

26:51.223 --> 26:55.387
Those who refuse to believe
needed to be purged from existence...

26:55.460 --> 26:57.928
so that we could begin anew.

26:59.731 --> 27:02.029
You know, in these parts...

27:02.100 --> 27:04.762
we like to call that
"crimes against humanity."

27:06.672 --> 27:09.300
If all you care about
is spiritual salvation...

27:09.374 --> 27:11.308
what do you need
the weapons for?

27:13.445 --> 27:15.970
The revolution is not yet complete.

27:17.215 --> 27:19.581
You mean you want
to take over Caledonia too.

27:19.651 --> 27:21.710
As I said...

27:21.787 --> 27:24.984
the revolution is not yet complete.

27:33.732 --> 27:35.666
Leda, you have to talk
to your husband.

27:35.734 --> 27:37.725
What am I supposed to say to him?

27:38.603 --> 27:42.130
That it's not too late to regain control,
to rebuild your country.

27:42.207 --> 27:44.835
- Everything you told me before.
- Daniel, I can't.

27:45.744 --> 27:47.837
- Why?
- Because I'd be lying.

27:48.914 --> 27:50.848
Jarrod is right.

27:50.916 --> 27:53.908
Those of us who were unlucky enough
to live through what's happened...

27:53.986 --> 27:56.216
will die soon enough...

27:56.288 --> 27:58.813
either through disease
or one of Soren's purges.

28:00.125 --> 28:02.616
- There is no future.
- Leda, you were right.

28:04.329 --> 28:06.627
There is hope.
Don't doubt that. Please.

28:10.535 --> 28:12.560
- You believe your people can help us?
- Yes.

28:14.239 --> 28:16.366
And what if you do overthrow Soren?
What then?

28:18.210 --> 28:20.144
You simply leave?

28:23.582 --> 28:27.609
When Jarrod became part of
Commander Gareth's inner circle, he...

28:28.954 --> 28:30.512
changed...

28:30.589 --> 28:32.147
became remote...

28:33.658 --> 28:35.216
and distant.

28:37.062 --> 28:38.996
I'd forgotten what it was like just...

28:40.332 --> 28:42.266
to talk to someone...

28:45.270 --> 28:46.669
to feel.

28:50.976 --> 28:54.969
I'll speak to him, Daniel,
but he won't hear me.

29:03.321 --> 29:05.448
Waste of time. Waste-

29:07.459 --> 29:09.450
Sir, I think the fact
that he hasn't left yet...

29:09.528 --> 29:11.928
could mean that he's
still willing to deal.

29:11.997 --> 29:14.022
He has no need
for humanitarian aid.

29:14.099 --> 29:17.068
The chaos in his country has only served
to strengthen his position.

29:17.135 --> 29:19.569
We can't just give up.

29:19.638 --> 29:21.629
Yes, I know that.

29:22.474 --> 29:25.272
We're continuing to monitor countless
radio signals coming from the planet.

29:25.343 --> 29:27.277
One of them could be from Daniel.

29:27.345 --> 29:29.336
- If we can find a way to contact him-
- Find it!

29:36.655 --> 29:38.145
Yes, sir.

29:47.532 --> 29:49.693
I'm telling you it's madness.
All it will accomplish...

29:49.768 --> 29:52.999
is to wipe out any chance we have to mount
a unified resistance in the future.

29:53.071 --> 29:57.132
But what if he's right? What if this
is our best opportunity to defeat Soren?

29:57.209 --> 30:00.610
You would have me throw away my life
and the lives of my men...

30:00.679 --> 30:02.670
so that Daniel can return to his world?

30:02.747 --> 30:06.808
It's not about that.
It's about rebuilding our world.

30:06.885 --> 30:09.046
His friends can help us do that.

30:10.088 --> 30:12.613
Jarrod, our people need this.

30:14.092 --> 30:16.083
You mean, he needs this.

30:17.195 --> 30:20.164
I'm not blind. I know that you and Daniel
have grown close during his convalescence.

30:20.232 --> 30:23.099
- Jarrod, it's not what you think.
- Let me speak.

30:25.537 --> 30:28.438
If I could live the last few years
differently, I would.

30:28.507 --> 30:30.941
I would make the time.

30:31.009 --> 30:33.569
But we no longer
have the luxury for regrets.

30:35.614 --> 30:37.605
I need to know.
Do you love him?

30:45.056 --> 30:46.785
I trust him.

30:51.630 --> 30:53.564
Once order has been established...

30:53.632 --> 30:56.863
the people of Avidan
will live differently than before-

30:56.935 --> 30:59.403
simply, humbly...

30:59.471 --> 31:01.701
waiting for our gods' inevitable return.

31:01.773 --> 31:06.005
You know, we've met these gods
upon whom you're so hot...

31:07.078 --> 31:09.979
and trust me when I tell you
they're not what you think they are.

31:10.048 --> 31:12.744
They will reward your worship
with enslavement.

31:12.817 --> 31:15.513
You are not the first
to try to sway our beliefs...

31:15.587 --> 31:19.546
but I can assure you...
our faith is unshakable.

31:21.226 --> 31:24.889
This is not about faith.
This is about a means to power.

31:45.550 --> 31:47.711
That went well.

31:47.786 --> 31:49.549
Sir, you better get up here.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.360
What?

32:03.435 --> 32:07.201
By implementing spread-spectrum frequency
hopping into our communications soft-

32:09.040 --> 32:11.907
<i>Hello? Guys?</i>

32:11.977 --> 32:14.377
- We found him.
- Sweet.

32:19.818 --> 32:23.219
- <i>Nice to hear your voice.</i>
- Likewise.

32:23.288 --> 32:25.313
You comin' home or what?

32:25.390 --> 32:28.848
Trying to- soon as I find my kel'tesh.

32:31.096 --> 32:32.927
What?

32:32.998 --> 32:36.434
<i>Looks a lot like my</i> ring'kol'nok.

32:36.501 --> 32:41.529
<i>You know, I lent it to thee for</i>
Grel'kar Kree'nor <i>Day.</i>

32:42.907 --> 32:45.740
- He's changed.
- Sir, he's speaking Goa'uld.

32:45.810 --> 32:47.778
"Ring'kol'nok" means "strategy."

32:48.847 --> 32:51.839
Kel'tesh speaks of
a well-known Jaffa battle tactic-

32:51.916 --> 32:53.907
a flanking attack from two sides.

33:02.594 --> 33:04.084
Yes, Daniel.

33:05.063 --> 33:07.190
I remember exactly where I put it.

33:08.767 --> 33:11.463
Any other... thoughts?

33:11.536 --> 33:15.472
<i>No. Just that I hope someone's been</i>
<i>feeding my</i> lo'assak <i>while I've been away.</i>

33:20.578 --> 33:24.070
We've pieced together
all the Goa'uld words Daniel gave us.

33:24.149 --> 33:27.915
LfTeal'c's translations are correct, he's
suggesting a strategy to retake the bunker.

33:27.986 --> 33:30.284
He is proposing a coordinated attack
against Soren.

33:30.355 --> 33:32.289
We come through the gate
at the same time...

33:32.357 --> 33:34.484
as Daniel and Kane's men
enter from the surface.

33:34.559 --> 33:37.687
I'm thinking we take
SG's 3, 6 and 1 <i>2 as backup.</i>

33:37.762 --> 33:40.993
We go in hot, secure the gate,
then extract Daniel.

33:41.066 --> 33:43.296
He has supplied an estimate
of the strength of Soren's forces...

33:43.368 --> 33:45.836
as well as a possible date
and time for the assault.

33:45.904 --> 33:48.498
Our next communication
is in five hours.

33:48.573 --> 33:50.803
All we need to do is confirm
everything and...

33:50.875 --> 33:52.809
of course, get a go from you, sir.

33:52.877 --> 33:57.473
All right, well, not to nitpick
or anything here, T, but...

33:58.650 --> 34:00.584
are you sure you got it right?

34:00.652 --> 34:02.483
I am certain, O'Neill.

34:04.923 --> 34:06.413
Okay.

34:07.826 --> 34:09.691
Go.

34:09.794 --> 34:12.160
Fifteen men?
That's hardly enough.

34:13.331 --> 34:15.595
They're some of the best
people on my planet.

34:15.667 --> 34:18.761
They're trained for missions exactly
like this. It'll be enough. Trust me.

34:19.804 --> 34:22.364
If we're gonna do this,
we have to set it up now.

34:22.440 --> 34:24.374
They're waiting for your response.

34:26.311 --> 34:28.745
A rebel patrol is approaching.

34:28.813 --> 34:30.747
Hide in the cellar.

34:30.815 --> 34:32.715
I know what to do.

34:50.168 --> 34:52.102
In the name of Soren,
open the door.

35:02.881 --> 35:05.975
Inspection. Stand aside.

35:06.651 --> 35:08.949
Please, just tell me
what you're looking for.

35:09.020 --> 35:11.113
- Who owns this house?
- I do.

35:11.189 --> 35:13.419
- Who else lives here?
- No one.

35:14.926 --> 35:16.416
You're hurting me!

35:16.494 --> 35:19.224
We know
loyalist soldiers are in the area.

35:19.297 --> 35:23.358
Collaboration is punishable by death.
Search the house!

35:29.541 --> 35:32.999
<i>There's no one else here, but we found</i>
<i>some men's clothes and boots.</i>

35:33.778 --> 35:36.838
- Now who else lives here?
- My husband did.

35:36.915 --> 35:39.145
He died last month from wounds
suffered during the bombings.

35:40.852 --> 35:44.049
Please.
I only wish to lead a simple life...

35:44.122 --> 35:46.647
as it is written in the ancient texts.

35:52.564 --> 35:55.795
There's nothing here.
Let's move.

36:10.915 --> 36:13.008
Once we're close enough,
we'll use the city's tunnel systems...

36:13.084 --> 36:15.518
to get us near one
of the bunker's access points.

36:15.587 --> 36:18.181
After we're inside, we'll wait for
Dr. Jackson's people to make their move.

36:18.256 --> 36:20.816
Then we make ours. Understood?

36:25.463 --> 36:27.954
Let's hope your friends keep
their end of the bargain.

37:00.765 --> 37:03.165
- If this works-
- You'll be going home.

37:05.770 --> 37:07.260
Leda, l-

37:08.773 --> 37:10.104
Go.

38:03.328 --> 38:06.195
Commander. Several posts
are no longer reporting in.

38:06.264 --> 38:09.563
Loyalist troops have entered from the surface
and have managed to take several key sections.

38:09.634 --> 38:11.761
- Then take them back.
- We cannot.

38:11.836 --> 38:14.202
They have coordinated an attack
with help from the off-worlders.

38:14.272 --> 38:16.467
We are losing control of the facility.

38:16.541 --> 38:20.272
If you're suggesting that we evacuate,
think again.

38:45.003 --> 38:46.903
Cease fire!

38:49.574 --> 38:52.634
- You guys okay?
- Yeah! We're fine!

39:22.974 --> 39:24.965
All stations are dark.

39:26.044 --> 39:28.706
The loyalists have us surrounded.

39:28.780 --> 39:31.908
- They are calling for our surrender.
- Engage them.

40:07.852 --> 40:09.649
Any chance he'll just surrender?

40:12.090 --> 40:14.615
Commander,
we are hopelessly outnumbered.

40:33.044 --> 40:35.035
We are all here for one purpose-

40:36.214 --> 40:39.240
to honor the will of our gods.

40:39.317 --> 40:41.512
In their names, we rose up.

40:41.586 --> 40:45.181
In their names,
we purged the nonbelievers.

40:45.256 --> 40:49.454
And in their names, we will die...
if necessary.

40:52.797 --> 40:57.063
We will not dishonor them
with cowardice.

40:59.203 --> 41:01.171
Now engage them.

41:09.313 --> 41:10.803
Engage them.

41:15.553 --> 41:17.544
You question your faith?

41:20.658 --> 41:22.819
I will show you faith.

41:35.173 --> 41:37.266
Drop your weapon!

41:39.010 --> 41:41.001
I said drop your weapon.
Now!

41:51.289 --> 41:53.484
Go, go! Move! Move!

41:53.558 --> 41:55.492
This way! This way!

41:55.560 --> 41:58.961
Drop all your weapons!
Surrender! Hold it! Stop!

41:59.030 --> 42:02.397
- It's over.
- I hope so.

42:02.466 --> 42:06.527
- You may have just made a martyr.
- I had no choice.

42:09.207 --> 42:11.198
You can return to your world now.

42:11.943 --> 42:14.912
What happened to us
was not your fault.

42:14.979 --> 42:16.469
I know.

42:17.481 --> 42:19.415
We made a promise,
and we intend to keep it.

42:21.485 --> 42:23.476
We'll be back to help you rebuild.

42:35.299 --> 42:37.096
Are you ready to go home?

42:38.536 --> 42:40.026
Yeah.
