WEBVTT

00:00.547 --> 00:02.062
I'm so excited to sell some eggs.

00:02.087 --> 00:04.625
Last night, I found 56
in their little coop!

00:04.650 --> 00:05.797
I know. I checked this morning,

00:05.821 --> 00:07.257
and there were, like, five dozen.

00:07.354 --> 00:09.179
Sitting on a gold mine!
All right, you ready?

00:09.204 --> 00:11.687
- Uh, yeah.
- One... two... three!

00:14.854 --> 00:16.471
And one, two, three.

00:17.812 --> 00:18.890
Whoo!

00:19.540 --> 00:22.257
- We're so in sync, baby.
- Like a Swiss timepiece.

00:22.282 --> 00:24.297
Yeah. Oh, what's this
oatmeal soap? This is cute.

00:24.322 --> 00:25.821
I have not bought oatmeal soap,

00:25.846 --> 00:26.869
so I would drop whatever

00:26.894 --> 00:27.908
- you're holding.
- Oh.

00:28.331 --> 00:29.464
Cold! Cold, cold, cold,

00:29.489 --> 00:30.504
- cold, cold, cold!
- What was that explosion?

00:30.528 --> 00:31.795
I don't know. What was that?

00:31.820 --> 00:33.093
Is it the hot water heater?

00:33.254 --> 00:34.452
Get out now! Save yourself!

00:34.665 --> 00:36.913
I can't! I haven't shaved
my pits in, like, two weeks!

00:36.938 --> 00:38.210
I don't care about that.

00:38.235 --> 00:39.437
No, I'm doing it for me.

00:39.462 --> 00:41.093
But thank you for
being so body positive.

00:41.118 --> 00:44.984
Mom, the water heater's broken,
so we're taking old-timey baths.

00:45.009 --> 00:47.493
- It's really cool.
- Rio, you need a warm shower.

00:47.818 --> 00:49.274
Cousin Emily took cold showers.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.501
Now she's got adult acne.

00:50.526 --> 00:52.407
We've got 12 pots of water.

00:52.432 --> 00:54.915
That's all it takes just
to fill it up ankle level.

00:55.252 --> 00:56.487
It's kind of romantic just, like,

00:56.511 --> 00:58.454
soaking in each other's broth, you know?

00:58.479 --> 00:59.932
Oh, hey. It's my mom.

01:00.204 --> 01:01.407
Oh, wow, how exciting.

01:01.432 --> 01:03.440
Mom, I-I have to go
because Mike's waiting.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.688
Mike's waiting.

01:04.714 --> 01:07.885
King Mike who dragged
you to live in Nebraska

01:07.910 --> 01:09.369
in his castle made of garbage?!

01:09.652 --> 01:11.683
I will send him your best.

01:11.708 --> 01:12.843
All right, bye.

01:12.867 --> 01:14.691
Did she, uh, say some
nasty stuff about me?

01:14.739 --> 01:16.353
- No.
- She does not like me.

01:16.378 --> 01:17.847
Stop it. She loves you.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.270
Okay, who's going first?

01:27.731 --> 01:30.074
This is actually really 
beautiful out here.

01:30.099 --> 01:32.942
It's just... I feel like
it's quaint, you know?

01:32.967 --> 01:34.248
Like, this is how you should...

01:37.381 --> 01:39.770
Oh, my God, we need to
fix the water heater!

01:39.795 --> 01:40.795
Right now!

01:44.957 --> 01:47.927
Look, we can get a new water heater

01:47.952 --> 01:49.709
if we tap into the savings.

01:49.795 --> 01:52.544
- Mm. 
- But we don't have any.

01:52.783 --> 01:54.771
- Sure. 
- So here's my pitch.

01:54.997 --> 01:57.212
- Uh-huh. 
- The hens are... are laying eggs,

01:57.237 --> 01:59.348
and we can take them to
the farmers' market...

01:59.373 --> 02:00.574
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

02:00.599 --> 02:03.951
I could dust off the old therapy jersey

02:03.976 --> 02:06.545
and look for some therapy patients here.

02:06.759 --> 02:09.395
You know, it's like, obviously,
I left that in New York, but...

02:09.420 --> 02:10.521
That's a great idea.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.849
I'm a little nervous how
many takers you'd have.

02:12.874 --> 02:15.998
We could obviously always
ask my mom for some help.

02:16.023 --> 02:18.493
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We don't need to do that.

02:18.518 --> 02:19.623
But what do I... what do I know?

02:19.648 --> 02:21.708
I bet therapy would work well here.

02:21.733 --> 02:22.990
You really don't want my mom to help.

02:23.015 --> 02:25.896
I guess I just thought, when
we moved 1,500 miles away,

02:25.921 --> 02:27.556
that she would be, you know,

02:27.581 --> 02:29.654
a little less involved in our lives.

02:29.679 --> 02:32.037
And that I would be, you know, free.

02:32.062 --> 02:34.427
- Free? 
- Well, no, not... not that word.

02:34.452 --> 02:36.522
- Love, when you married me...
- Yeah.

02:36.939 --> 02:37.947
You married my mom.

02:37.972 --> 02:39.549
I mean, that became very clear

02:39.574 --> 02:41.689
when she did vows at our ceremony.

02:41.714 --> 02:44.229
She didn't do vows at our 
ceremony. She... She had a...

02:45.043 --> 02:48.057
poem that she wanted to
read that was ill-timed.

02:49.621 --> 02:50.729
Oh, boy. Here she is.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.143
Listen, I-I-I think it's time for us

02:52.168 --> 02:53.996
to stand on our own two feet, okay...

02:54.029 --> 02:55.173
- Okay... 
- ... and do this on our own.

02:55.198 --> 02:56.517
We... We got to tell Donna no.

02:56.542 --> 02:58.744
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead
and let you do that.

02:59.155 --> 03:00.157
All right.

03:00.296 --> 03:02.498
Hi, Donna. Uh, I'm 
answering Rio's phone.

03:02.523 --> 03:04.139
Mike, I need to confirm the address

03:04.164 --> 03:05.428
for the water-heater delivery.

03:05.555 --> 03:07.936
The guy said he can't find
"Dirt Road" on his apps.

03:07.961 --> 03:09.951
Oh, you know, that's so generous of you

03:09.976 --> 03:11.701
to offer a water heater, but, um...

03:11.726 --> 03:13.655
- Take the water heater...
- ... no.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.336
- Excuse me?
- We're gonna handle it ourselves.

03:17.432 --> 03:19.567
Oh. Okay.

03:19.592 --> 03:21.336
Well, absolutely.

03:21.361 --> 03:22.844
No problem, Mike.

03:23.394 --> 03:24.547
Goodbye.

03:27.692 --> 03:30.883
Well... Donna's. Been. Handled.

03:31.573 --> 03:33.351
Good. Luck. With. That.

03:35.784 --> 03:36.791
Oy.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.674
Well, you see, I want my
booth to be simple but catchy,

03:39.699 --> 03:41.799
so I'm gonna go with "The Egg Man."

03:41.925 --> 03:43.706
- What do you think?
- "The Egg Man." I like it.

03:43.731 --> 03:45.519
- Yeah.
- Haunting visual. Sticks with you.

03:45.544 --> 03:46.566
Mm, good.

03:46.591 --> 03:48.059
 You guys done yet?

03:48.084 --> 03:50.402
You know, I-I got to
get to my scrapbooking.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.191
You may have just observed
me hiding from Constance.

03:55.430 --> 03:57.746
Things have been a little
awkward with us lately.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.457
Oh, just lately they got awkward?

03:59.482 --> 04:00.879
Yeah, she asked me out. I said no.

04:00.904 --> 04:02.277
I've been trying to get
her to ask me out again,

04:02.302 --> 04:03.332
but she won't take the bait.

04:03.357 --> 04:05.223
Well, look, buddy. You
just got to keep trying.

04:05.248 --> 04:07.283
She'll be back on that
Rudy hook in no time.

04:07.308 --> 04:09.098
That's a little graphic,
Mike. I don't care for it.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.473
No, no, I was just building
on your "bait" metaphor...

04:11.498 --> 04:12.699
- the... the...
- That'll do, Mike.

04:13.513 --> 04:14.537
Okay, listen.

04:14.735 --> 04:15.912
You got to get your head in the game.

04:16.127 --> 04:17.208
- Okay. 
- It's show time.

04:17.241 --> 04:18.409
- Yeah. 
- Let's go.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.564
Constance.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.329
Rudy.

04:21.353 --> 04:23.189
Mike and I are going to the
farmers' market in Lincoln.

04:23.214 --> 04:24.439
Can I purchase you anything?

04:24.464 --> 04:26.466
Well, if you see something
that I might like.

04:27.045 --> 04:28.119
- Oh. 
- Will do.

04:28.331 --> 04:29.471
There we go.

04:30.866 --> 04:32.447
Oh, hey, husband.

04:32.472 --> 04:33.616
- You got your flyers? 
- Yeah.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.190
- Oh, wow, they're great.
- Thanks.

04:35.215 --> 04:36.820
- Yeah, good luck.
- Thanks, honey. You, too.

04:36.845 --> 04:38.031
- Mm.
- Okay.

04:38.205 --> 04:39.245
No, Rudy, we're not there.

04:39.278 --> 04:40.470
- Okay. 
- We are not there.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.637
Hey, do these work?

04:42.662 --> 04:44.465
I sort of need them to work, so...

04:44.497 --> 04:47.074
"Do you know what's
wrong with you? I do!"

04:47.417 --> 04:50.059
Yeah, it's more, "Do you
know what's wrong with you?

04:50.521 --> 04:53.324
Don't worry about it"...
That's the subtext... "I do."

04:53.349 --> 04:54.356
Is that for therapy?

04:54.381 --> 04:55.801
Yeah. I mean, if you
don't like that one,

04:55.826 --> 04:58.121
this one is, "Do you cry at night?

04:58.197 --> 05:00.632
- Try doing it during the day."
- No.

05:00.775 --> 05:03.009
"Got a screw loose? Let me tighten it."

05:03.034 --> 05:04.670
Rio, are you looking for people

05:04.695 --> 05:06.321
who like talking about themselves?

05:06.346 --> 05:07.407
Desperately, yes.

05:07.432 --> 05:08.462
Ever scrapbooked?

05:08.582 --> 05:09.582
What?

05:09.777 --> 05:12.175
- ... like scalloped.
- Who's got the snowflake tape?

05:12.200 --> 05:14.235
Got to check out these
decorative scissors, Deb.

05:14.260 --> 05:15.905
- Look at that.
- Oh, I love that little braid.

05:15.930 --> 05:17.074
You know, what is truly shocking

05:17.099 --> 05:18.838
is that you brought Rio, Constance.

05:18.863 --> 05:20.486
Mostly because I didn't invite her.

05:20.701 --> 05:22.588
Oh, I'm... like, I can hear
you, Kay, when you say that.

05:22.613 --> 05:23.689
I know.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.706
- I'm here because I wanted to ask...
- The theme is "vacation."

05:25.731 --> 05:27.323
Did you bring some vacation pictures?

05:27.348 --> 05:29.362
Oh, uh, vacation, huh?

05:29.387 --> 05:31.049
Well, I brought two photos...

05:31.074 --> 05:32.940
You brought two photos to scrapbooking?

05:32.965 --> 05:34.769
Well, that's not a book. 
That's just scraps!

05:35.567 --> 05:36.761
Oh.

05:39.209 --> 05:41.684
Look, I-I'm not sure if
you ladies, uh, know this,

05:41.709 --> 05:43.801
but I-I'm actually a
licensed therapist...

05:43.826 --> 05:44.950
Does anybody have the glitter?

05:44.975 --> 05:46.060
- What? 
- No one can hear

05:46.085 --> 05:47.248
anything you say, Clara.

05:47.273 --> 05:49.482
I would love to offer my services,

05:49.507 --> 05:50.857
see if anyone was interested in

05:50.882 --> 05:53.889
paying to have someone listen
to them or provide insight...

05:53.914 --> 05:54.935
People pay to talk to you?

05:54.960 --> 05:56.928
- Uh, yes. 
- So I could've been

05:56.953 --> 05:58.569
charging this whole time?

05:58.594 --> 05:59.772
You owe me $40.

05:59.797 --> 06:00.898
You owe me $50.

06:00.923 --> 06:02.538
You owe me thousands of dollars.

06:04.723 --> 06:05.944
- Uh, Miss Rio? 
- Yes?

06:05.969 --> 06:07.340
Do you want me to dry your page for you?

06:08.317 --> 06:10.118
- Oh, uh, sure, yes.
- Yeah?

06:10.361 --> 06:11.463
- Okay. 
- I think. Is that a...

06:11.488 --> 06:13.590
Yeah, I'm the dryer to... today.

06:14.573 --> 06:15.705
Oh, my God.

06:16.723 --> 06:17.840
- Jacob. 
- Huh?

06:17.865 --> 06:18.887
Why are you shaking?

06:19.177 --> 06:20.478
Did you have too many cookies?

06:20.503 --> 06:21.902
Okay, Mom, don't you have to...

06:21.927 --> 06:23.277
- Is he diabetic? 
- No.

06:23.302 --> 06:24.466
Nope.

06:25.605 --> 06:27.262
Linda, oh, my God,
look at how much glitter

06:27.287 --> 06:28.927
you're putting around your photo.

06:28.976 --> 06:31.445
I could never put that
much sparkle on myself.

06:31.470 --> 06:33.415
Sometimes even just the
glue stick is a bit sassy.

06:33.963 --> 06:35.083
Why do you think that is?

06:35.176 --> 06:37.955
Just dull cardboard borders,
just fine for old Deb.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.830
You know, we call
that negative self talk

06:39.855 --> 06:41.611
when we talk o-ourselves down.

06:41.636 --> 06:44.838
I sort of feel like you
are a sparkly unicorn.

06:44.863 --> 06:45.869
You know what I mean?

06:46.354 --> 06:47.393
A unicorn?

06:47.418 --> 06:49.994
Is that the kind of thing
you talk about in therapy?

06:50.204 --> 06:51.468
I thought it was like,

06:51.577 --> 06:54.338
"I had a dream about a talking
dog. What does it mean?"

06:54.363 --> 06:55.831
Hmm, depends what the dog's saying.

06:55.856 --> 06:57.182
- Rio, dear... 
- Yes?

06:57.207 --> 06:59.393
... please don't peddle your wares here.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.667
U-Uh, nothing personal.
We had to shut Clara down

07:01.692 --> 07:03.605
when she was pushing
those insane necklaces

07:03.630 --> 07:04.753
made out of bunny bones.

07:04.778 --> 07:06.097
Oh, and then there were sea horses.

07:07.707 --> 07:09.097
- What?
- Sea horses.

07:09.331 --> 07:10.409
Oh, God.

07:10.434 --> 07:14.675
I mean, no one is gonna pay you
to tell us what our dreams mean.

07:14.839 --> 07:16.855
Every dream I have, I'm
the Queen of England,

07:16.880 --> 07:18.612
and... and I'm married
to a pile of money.

07:18.645 --> 07:19.683
Case closed.

07:20.223 --> 07:22.050
Do you guys want to
see my head on a cat?

07:25.292 --> 07:27.933
Deb, are you still working on that page

07:27.958 --> 07:29.259
about our trip to Okoboji?

07:29.284 --> 07:30.394
- Yes, yep, yep. 
- Girl!

07:30.419 --> 07:32.620
That's the summer of '97.

07:32.645 --> 07:34.050
I remember when we...

07:35.042 --> 07:37.065
Aww, it's Morris.

07:37.171 --> 07:39.506
I haven't seen this
picture in a very long time.

07:40.008 --> 07:44.628
You know, I-I saw some... some
coconut stickers somewhere,

07:44.653 --> 07:47.684
and I, uh... I'm gonna go 
get them. I'll be right back.

Oh, boy!

08:02.662 --> 08:04.105
Sorry. Uh...

08:04.833 --> 08:07.840
Kay locks me in here
until scrapbooking's done.

08:07.865 --> 08:10.433
I can't go back until
the timer goes off.

08:12.580 --> 08:13.957
Uh, meat kebab?

08:17.854 --> 08:18.879
I've got five.

08:20.156 --> 08:21.215
There's only one of me.

08:22.146 --> 08:23.723
Or two of us.

08:30.337 --> 08:31.855
I'm looking for a
gift for a lady sheriff

08:31.880 --> 08:33.801
who's also the proprietor of a store.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.066
I got some gouda.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.590
Okay, I don't know what that
is, but I know it's not cheese.

08:41.543 --> 08:42.605
Oh.

08:43.191 --> 08:45.285
Hey. Okay, okay. Hello!

08:45.575 --> 08:47.410
Mike, so nice to see your face.

08:47.435 --> 08:48.832
Where... Where are you?

08:48.857 --> 08:50.886
A-At the gym, or... Are you on a boat?

08:50.911 --> 08:52.011
Circuit training.

08:52.036 --> 08:53.838
Listen, my sister's
daughter's orthodontist

08:53.863 --> 08:56.363
has a son at the University of Nebraska.

08:56.388 --> 08:57.522
Name is Seth.

08:57.547 --> 08:59.246
Studying to be a computer engineer.

08:59.384 --> 09:01.785
Did you know the starting
salary for a computer engineer

09:01.810 --> 09:03.011
is a million bucks?

09:03.036 --> 09:04.559
I don't think that 
could be right, Donna.

09:04.584 --> 09:06.849
What do you know? So I could 
have him down there in a flash,

09:06.874 --> 09:08.075
help you sell the eggs.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.060
Well, that is a white-hot offer,

09:10.085 --> 09:12.463
but you can tell that geek to 
go ahead and stay home.

09:12.488 --> 09:14.155
I've got everything here under control.

09:14.180 --> 09:15.819
- Hey! Excuse me, sir?
- What's happening?

09:15.844 --> 09:16.904
- Egg Man!
- Yeah?

09:16.929 --> 09:18.006
- What are you doing here?
- Me?

09:18.031 --> 09:20.100
- What's happening, Mike?
- Or maybe not. Anyways, I got to go.

09:20.125 --> 09:21.260
Beautiful bicep work.

09:22.164 --> 09:23.756
Am I doing this right?

09:24.706 --> 09:27.176
Hi. You can't just set
up wherever you want.

09:27.201 --> 09:28.513
Look, I-I-I'm sorry. I thought it was

09:28.538 --> 09:30.294
kind of like first-come, first-serve.

09:30.426 --> 09:32.185
So, w-where do you have us?

09:32.656 --> 09:34.292
Farm-fresh eggs.

09:34.317 --> 09:36.482
Get your farm-fresh eggs.

09:36.507 --> 09:37.641
Ohh!

09:37.666 --> 09:40.002
Oh, my gosh! Ohh!

09:47.749 --> 09:48.749
Hey.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.973
I think they sent someone
to get more toilet paper.

09:50.998 --> 09:52.051
I don't know when they're gonna be back.

09:52.076 --> 09:53.545
Um, I'm looking for The Egg Man.

09:53.632 --> 09:55.535
Oh! Ha, yes!

09:55.832 --> 09:56.949
- I'm The Egg Man!
- Hi.

09:56.974 --> 09:58.613
Oh, this is so exciting.

09:58.638 --> 10:00.238
How many, uh, cartons can I get you?

10:00.263 --> 10:02.583
- Uh... Two?
- I'll take all your eggs.

10:02.731 --> 10:04.895
You want all the eggs.
Well, you can have 'em.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.922
Yeah. There's, uh,
$400 in this envelope.

10:08.186 --> 10:09.987
Oh, my... four... wait.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.537
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:11.769 --> 10:13.748
Nebraska... Donna must have sent you.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.475
- You're Seth, aren't you? 
- No.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.278
Oh, really? What do you
think of the, uh, dark web?

10:17.560 --> 10:18.751
It's the one true Internet.

10:18.776 --> 10:19.790
Yeah, I knew it.

10:19.815 --> 10:21.750
That's such a textbook
computer-geek answer.

10:21.775 --> 10:23.806
Listen, Don... Donna's
not gonna buy me off.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.478
You take your money. I
don't want your filthy money.

10:25.503 --> 10:26.713
- No, take the money.
- No, no, you take...

10:26.738 --> 10:27.996
Hey, hey, hey. Give me these eggs!

10:28.021 --> 10:29.036
- Put those eggs down! 
- I want your eggs!

10:29.061 --> 10:30.097
- Hey! 
- Seth, put the eggs down!

10:30.122 --> 10:31.738
She said she'd help
with my student loans!

10:32.418 --> 10:35.191
Are you... Are you shoving kids?

10:35.216 --> 10:36.379
Don't let those braces fool you.

10:36.404 --> 10:37.894
He was sent by a woman in New York,

10:37.919 --> 10:41.528
- and he's trying to buy all my eggs!
- Okay, pack up, you're done.

10:41.877 --> 10:43.778
Our security guy's getting fresh juice,

10:43.803 --> 10:48.083
but he'll be back in 15,
and he's gonna kick your ass.

10:49.004 --> 10:51.192
Doesn't sound very farmers' market-y.

10:51.506 --> 10:54.973
Do you remember, uh, the time
Morris bought that waffle maker?

10:54.998 --> 10:57.106
Yeah, he was waffling everything
that shouldn't be waffled.

10:57.131 --> 10:58.481
How about the time...
remember he had drank

10:58.506 --> 10:59.700
six Long Island Iced Teas

10:59.725 --> 11:01.137
before he realized there 
was booze in them?

11:01.162 --> 11:04.388
Yes, I found him fully clothed 
in our shower the next day.

11:06.007 --> 11:08.272
- You have any 3s?
- Ah! Yes.

11:08.539 --> 11:10.030
It's good to talk about Morris.

11:11.366 --> 11:12.428
He was a good friend.

11:13.568 --> 11:14.600
I miss him.

11:15.882 --> 11:17.671
Well, you're lucky to have Kay,

11:18.355 --> 11:20.999
someone who really knows you.

11:21.171 --> 11:22.194
You know?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.844
You ever feel like the person
you've known your whole life

11:27.869 --> 11:30.211
is really just a stranger?

11:32.514 --> 11:33.647
I'm just kidding.

11:34.767 --> 11:35.968
Do you have any 9s?

11:36.124 --> 11:37.914
You wish. Go fish!

11:39.376 --> 11:40.655
- Okay. 
- Yeah, buster.

11:40.680 --> 11:45.085
- So, "I... deserve..."
- I... deserve... this sticker!

11:45.204 --> 11:46.500
Exactly.

11:46.525 --> 11:49.117
I deserve love, and I deserve happiness.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.992
And I... And I just put
a sticker on my face!

11:52.017 --> 11:53.651
That's very sparkly.

11:53.676 --> 11:55.145
And it feels good, right?

11:55.192 --> 11:56.438
- Give me one of those flyers.
- It feels really good.

11:56.471 --> 11:57.770
- Yeah, I'll take a flyer, too.
- Yeah?

11:57.795 --> 12:00.317
Kay, you've got to
let her do your pages.

12:00.556 --> 12:02.692
Rio, um, can I just
talk to you for a second?

12:02.717 --> 12:03.989
- Of course, like...
- Thank you.

12:04.014 --> 12:07.271
... I totally get it. You
keep all that glitter up.

12:08.452 --> 12:10.587
Mrs. Olsen is a good friend of mine.

12:10.612 --> 12:12.698
- Oh, okay. 
- And she has really desperately

12:12.723 --> 12:15.566
needed someone to talk to ever 
since her brother moved to Venice

12:15.591 --> 12:17.980
- to row those Italian boats.
- Oh, gondolas.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.723
I told her you'd be over A.S.A.P.

12:19.748 --> 12:21.521
- Oh, now. 
- So just ride your bike

12:21.546 --> 12:22.755
down Old Trail...

12:22.780 --> 12:24.209
- Old Trail... 
- and then you're gonna turn on

12:24.234 --> 12:26.233
- Elkhorn Lake Road...
- Elkhorn Lake Road.

12:26.258 --> 12:27.733
- ... and then you'll see it.
- When I come back...?

12:27.758 --> 12:29.023
- Yeah?
- Do you mind seating me

12:29.048 --> 12:30.406
- by Clara? 
- Sure.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.347
Hi, Mike. Did you sell any eggs yet?

12:37.372 --> 12:39.571
Well, zero, but it's not my fault.

12:39.596 --> 12:41.657
Your mother infiltrated
the farmers' market.

12:41.682 --> 12:43.884
Oh, it's my mom's fault? Cool.

12:43.909 --> 12:46.805
Well, I'm heading to see
a potential new client,

12:46.830 --> 12:48.141
but I think I'm a little lost.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.462
I'm on Elkhorn Lake Road.

12:49.487 --> 12:51.118
I'm about to turn off
right now, all right?

12:51.143 --> 12:53.196
No, no, no, don't... don't
turn off of Elkhorn Lake Road.

12:53.221 --> 12:54.743
Why? I already did it.

12:54.768 --> 12:56.837
Elkhorn Lake Road is
named after Elkhorn Lake,

12:56.862 --> 12:58.235
which is right on the edge of...

12:58.260 --> 12:59.260
H-Honey?

12:59.285 --> 13:01.728
- Rio, w-what's happening? Are you okay?
- Back pedal, back pedal!

13:01.753 --> 13:04.011
There's a lake!

13:05.086 --> 13:06.128
Rio! Oh, my God!

13:07.181 --> 13:08.845
Honey, honey!

13:09.208 --> 13:13.072
Rio. Rio? Rio? Rio?

13:13.479 --> 13:14.486
Oh, hello?

13:14.511 --> 13:16.159
- You know Rio's in a lake, right?
- Yes, I know...

13:16.184 --> 13:17.893
That just happened. 
How do you know that?

13:17.918 --> 13:19.252
I track her phone, dumb nuts.

13:19.277 --> 13:21.214
Now, I'm dialing her right
now, and I'm merging calls.

13:21.239 --> 13:23.417
No, Donna, I don't need you
involved in this right now.

13:23.442 --> 13:25.073
- Do not merge us. 
- I'm merging.

13:25.098 --> 13:27.637
- Don't merge. Don't...
- I merged. I merged.

13:27.662 --> 13:29.699
- Mom? Mike? 
- Honey, are you okay?

13:29.724 --> 13:31.544
Do not swallow lake water.

13:31.569 --> 13:33.154
- There are parasites! 
- What?

13:33.179 --> 13:35.092
Donna, do you see how
you're complicating this?

13:35.117 --> 13:37.140
- Let me check on my... Honey...
- I don't understand

13:37.165 --> 13:38.531
- Are you okay?
- the words you're saying. Hello.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.945
Tell your husband to respect me!

13:40.970 --> 13:44.835
Donna, I need you to buzz
off and leave us alone, okay?!

13:44.860 --> 13:46.109
Stop it! Both of you!

13:46.134 --> 13:48.413
You are driving me crazy right now.

13:48.614 --> 13:50.826
You are the two people that
I love the most in the world,

13:50.851 --> 13:52.577
so just shut up and figure it out.

13:55.014 --> 13:56.452
Ohh, God.

13:57.121 --> 13:58.327
Disgusting.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.457
Hello, Rio, are you...

14:02.786 --> 14:06.691
What? Oh, wow, you, uh, really
didn't hit the brakes, did you?

14:06.861 --> 14:08.238
Nope, I did not.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.301
Oh, come on.

14:12.589 --> 14:14.699
My sorority pulled much worse pranks.

14:14.844 --> 14:15.968
- Really? 
- Yeah, one time they

14:15.993 --> 14:18.327
sold me on eBay for a dollar.

14:18.352 --> 14:19.624
It was funny.

14:21.002 --> 14:22.002
Was it?

14:22.027 --> 14:25.070
Anyway, I'm so sorry that no
one will pay to talk to you.

14:25.245 --> 14:26.346
It's okay.

14:27.063 --> 14:31.546
I just... I realized that I
really miss helping people.

14:31.879 --> 14:34.304
It's, like... It's, like, the one thing

14:34.329 --> 14:36.531
I'm really... I'm really 
good at, you know?

14:36.759 --> 14:37.793
That and debate.

14:37.850 --> 14:39.188
But I feel like my mom probably paid off

14:39.213 --> 14:40.266
most of the kids to lose.

14:40.291 --> 14:45.032
But a person who sends another
person into a pond of manure,

14:45.958 --> 14:48.992
of just ass poo, is
hiding a lot of pain.

14:50.787 --> 14:51.788
I'm gonna go home.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.221
There's something in my shoe...

14:53.418 --> 14:55.274
and, uh, it's alive.

14:55.299 --> 14:56.601
Oh.

14:56.626 --> 14:59.016
Listen. Sorry about
before, but Rio's mad.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.055
We got to do better. I'll go first.

15:01.342 --> 15:03.782
You know, I get upset
when you offer us stuff

15:03.807 --> 15:07.544
because I feel like
you don't believe in me.

15:07.681 --> 15:09.430
- That's not what I'm saying. 
- Come on.

15:09.455 --> 15:11.571
I know you don't like
me. You can say it.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.656
You know what?

15:15.043 --> 15:17.251
You're right. I don't
really like you that much.

15:17.276 --> 15:19.078
Yes! See?! Oh!

15:19.103 --> 15:20.626
The truth... it feels so good, right?

15:20.651 --> 15:22.376
I don't like your whole vibe, you know?

15:22.867 --> 15:26.087
"Everything's gonna be great
if only we love each other!"

15:26.549 --> 15:27.954
- That whole thing annoys me.
- Mmm.

15:28.047 --> 15:29.554
- You're too tall. 
- What can I do about that?

15:29.579 --> 15:30.734
Why does a person need to be that tall?

15:30.759 --> 15:32.218
And you're way overconfident

15:32.243 --> 15:34.391
- with your restaurant recommendations.
- Okay. Fantastic.

15:34.416 --> 15:37.712
Now I know how you feel, 
and you know how I feel,

15:37.816 --> 15:40.705
so in the future, if we
need help, we'll reach out.

15:40.731 --> 15:41.770
How's that sound?

15:41.846 --> 15:43.666
Ugh, they put so much 
mayonnaise in this egg salad.

15:43.691 --> 15:44.745
This is disgusting.

15:44.770 --> 15:47.253
- I asked you to leave an hour ago. 
- Mike?

15:47.278 --> 15:49.198
Clarence is ready to
forcibly remove you.

15:49.223 --> 15:51.073
- And we're dating... 
- Where did you go?

15:51.098 --> 15:52.417
... so he will protect me with his life.

15:52.442 --> 15:54.394
Wait a minute. Who's that?
Somebody's kicking you out?

15:54.419 --> 15:56.997
- Let me talk to them.
- No, Donna, we just went over this.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.458
If... If I need your help...

15:58.848 --> 16:01.410
Actually, you're on with Danika.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.761
Enjoy.

16:02.905 --> 16:03.940
Hello.

16:03.965 --> 16:05.769
I'm the person who's gonna shut you down

16:05.794 --> 16:08.800
for violating every major
health code, Danika.

16:08.825 --> 16:10.426
You don't want a piece of this, baby.

16:10.451 --> 16:13.512
I get full refunds for
things I didn't even buy...

16:13.537 --> 16:15.907
including automobiles!

16:16.071 --> 16:18.919
I get pilots kicked off of planes.

16:18.944 --> 16:22.186
I'm the reason you can only leave 
three reviews a day on Yelp.

16:22.211 --> 16:25.998
Believe me, young lady, I
am not to be trifled with.

16:31.072 --> 16:32.281
Knock, knock!

16:32.306 --> 16:33.650
Oh, sorry. You know what?

16:33.675 --> 16:35.391
I thought you might want this, so, um,

16:35.416 --> 16:36.820
I don't know what a bat mitzvah is,

16:36.845 --> 16:38.164
but the photo was amusing.

16:38.351 --> 16:39.486
Can I come in?

16:39.521 --> 16:41.492
Um, yeah.

16:41.517 --> 16:42.551
Here.

16:42.576 --> 16:43.944
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

16:45.490 --> 16:48.271
Rio, I'm so sorry that I sent
you into that poo-poo pond.

16:48.296 --> 16:50.177
Oh, so there was manure in it, right?

16:50.202 --> 16:52.905
Oh, yeah, a lot. But as long
as you closed your mouth

16:52.930 --> 16:54.319
when you went in, you should be fine.

16:57.847 --> 16:58.848
Right.

16:59.257 --> 17:01.592
You know what, Kay? Don't even sweat it.

17:01.617 --> 17:04.420
I feel like everyone, at
some point in their life,

17:04.584 --> 17:07.310
gets sent into a poo-poo
pond of some sort.

17:07.724 --> 17:09.491
Do you ever feel like
you're just covered in poo?

17:09.516 --> 17:13.037
Like, not literal poo, but
kind of... emotional poo?

17:13.704 --> 17:14.756
Only all the time.

17:16.505 --> 17:17.505
Whew.

17:17.530 --> 17:21.077
Kay, uh, would you, um...

17:21.241 --> 17:24.030
want to do a therapy
session, just you and me?

17:24.055 --> 17:25.513
- Okay, no way. 
- Okay.

17:25.539 --> 17:26.816
- What are you talking about? 
- I-I just...

17:26.840 --> 17:29.562
That's only for, you know,
people on Twitter or sad people.

17:29.790 --> 17:31.460
But I could maybe just do a, um...

17:31.562 --> 17:35.749
maybe like a one-on-one
"scrapbooking session"?

17:35.774 --> 17:36.774
Oh.

17:38.150 --> 17:39.184
Yes.

17:39.363 --> 17:41.304
- Okay, I brought my kit.
- Great.

17:41.891 --> 17:43.304
Before we do the scrapbooking page

17:43.329 --> 17:46.328
about the family reunion
where I cooked for 25 people

17:46.353 --> 17:47.954
and not one person said "thank you,"

17:47.979 --> 17:49.890
I just want to make sure
that everything that happens

17:49.915 --> 17:51.351
in scrapbooking stays between us.

17:51.376 --> 17:54.499
Oh, yeah, this is a private
scrapbooking session.

17:54.767 --> 17:56.587
- Protected by HIPAA.
- Okay, good.

17:56.685 --> 17:57.775
So, the first things first,

17:57.800 --> 17:59.439
I am gonna fix your water heater.

17:59.464 --> 18:00.737
- Oh. 
- You need to take a shower.

18:00.762 --> 18:01.956
You smell like hot mayonnaise.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.425
- You know how to do that? 
- Where is it?

18:03.450 --> 18:04.585
- It's over here. 
- Okay, great.

18:04.610 --> 18:06.360
- Oh, God! Rio! 
- I'm sorry, it's...

18:10.870 --> 18:11.870
Constance.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.044
I brought you something back
from the farmers' market.

18:15.656 --> 18:16.656
Oh.

18:16.994 --> 18:18.500
Thank you.

18:21.592 --> 18:24.219
The sales lady said that
women have reclaimed that word,

18:24.748 --> 18:26.797
that now it embodies female empowerment.

18:26.870 --> 18:28.195
She also said that it's pronounced,

18:28.689 --> 18:31.039
"that bitch" or "that bitch!"

18:33.354 --> 18:35.031
Yeah, uh, thank you.

18:37.667 --> 18:38.836
I hoped you'd like it,

18:39.836 --> 18:42.006
but I realized I don't
know what you like.

18:43.315 --> 18:44.828
I don't know much about you at all.

18:45.909 --> 18:47.453
Yeah, I suppose you don't.

18:47.678 --> 18:49.000
But not getting to know you,

18:49.901 --> 18:51.867
that would be one of
my greatest regrets.

18:59.127 --> 19:01.597
You know, I-I was thinking about

19:01.630 --> 19:03.766
going to the county
fair in a couple weeks.

19:03.799 --> 19:05.744
And maybe you could come with me?

19:06.400 --> 19:08.587
Oh, I would like that
very much, Constance.

19:08.620 --> 19:09.620
Good.

19:10.158 --> 19:13.017
Because I am... that bitch.

19:14.018 --> 19:15.627
- Huh?
- Okay.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.537
Ooh, baby.

19:31.828 --> 19:33.396
Hello.

19:34.803 --> 19:37.202
I hope I'm not misreading your cues but,

19:37.446 --> 19:39.118
do you want to do some sex stuff

19:39.143 --> 19:40.727
against the broken hot water heater?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.141
It's fixed.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.301
- No! 
- Yes.

19:46.326 --> 19:47.516
No, who fixed it?!

19:47.541 --> 19:49.954
I worked something out
with my new therapy patient!

19:49.979 --> 19:51.141
- You got a patient?! 
- Yes!

19:51.166 --> 19:52.688
Oh, I have so many
guesses who it could be.

19:52.805 --> 19:54.227
- Tell me. 
- I can't.

19:54.252 --> 19:55.554
- Oh, so much integrity. 
- You know.

19:55.579 --> 19:57.213
Such a good therapist.

19:57.903 --> 19:59.727
Honey, I want to talk
to you about something.

19:59.752 --> 20:00.766
What?

20:01.108 --> 20:03.500
I am genuinely sorry about my mom.

20:03.525 --> 20:04.892
- I feel like... 
- No, no, no, no, no. I am sorry.

20:04.917 --> 20:06.384
- No. 
- I-I'm sorry about your mom.

20:06.409 --> 20:08.689
And we had a breakthrough today.

20:08.714 --> 20:10.783
- You did? 
- She told me she doesn't like me!

20:10.808 --> 20:13.323
- She sugarcoated it!
- Yeah!

20:13.348 --> 20:15.776
And she promised to
call a little bit less.

20:15.801 --> 20:17.470
- All right, well... 
- Yes.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.150
- What the hell are you guys doing?
- Oh, my gosh.

20:20.329 --> 20:22.142
- My mom is in your pants. 
- I forgot.

20:22.167 --> 20:23.830
I was afraid to hang up 'cause,
you know, she gets so angry.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.204
No, that adds up. M-Mom...

20:25.229 --> 20:26.665
- Rio, are you there? 
- H-Hi.

20:26.690 --> 20:27.991
Your husband is very needy,

20:28.016 --> 20:29.635
but we'll talk about that on Sunday.

20:29.660 --> 20:32.322
Okay. I... I love you.

20:32.347 --> 20:34.144
At least you guys still have chemistry.

20:34.169 --> 20:35.277
G-Good hearing from you.

20:40.358 --> 20:42.402
Put you there.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.753
My number-one smokeshow.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.292
Yeah, that feels right.

20:48.867 --> 20:50.831
Jacob, what are you doing?

20:50.856 --> 20:52.511
Mom, it's nothing! God!

20:52.785 --> 20:54.219
Just leave me alone!

20:54.761 --> 20:55.949
Ugh!

20:57.445 --> 20:59.117
