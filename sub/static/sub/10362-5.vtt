00:18.640 --> 00:20.160
Well, I'm the boss now.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.080
Don't worry about my people.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.280
But you better worry about yours.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.560
[gunshots]

00:27.760 --> 00:29.680
[Frank]
It ain't safe around here no more.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.720
[agent]  From now on,
you're Giovanni Henriksen.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.840
[in Norwegian]
There's something fishy about that guy.

00:37.480 --> 00:41.080
I'm the project manager
for Sjusjøen Belleview.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.000
Thomas, you must meet
our new partner properly.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.520
Oh!

00:46.600 --> 00:48.960
- Why, hello.
- [in English] We go way back.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.160
[in Norwegian] Help!

00:50.240 --> 00:52.600
We want to treat you
to a trip to Graceland.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.600
So at least you'll be using your
suspension time on something enjoyable.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.120
I've converted to Islam.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.800
[Richard]  No. He's gone to seed
since his son ran away.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.240
[Svein] Congratulations.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.400
- We're having twins?
- [in English] Fuck me.­

01:56.600 --> 01:59.160
[cell phone ringing]

01:59.240 --> 02:01.040
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.800
[in Norwegian]   Listen,
I'm sitting here looking at carriages,

02:02.880 --> 02:05.040
and I was wondering,
do you think we should have

02:05.120 --> 02:08.240
one of those where they sit
one after the other,

02:08.320 --> 02:11.520
or should we go
for the wide type of carriage?

02:11.600 --> 02:13.480
[in English] I'm not...
I'm not sure I follow.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.240
Tomorrow we're going to shop
for the baby carriage, you know.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.840
Oh, yeah.
I wouldn't miss that for the world.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.200
And then, I'm just wondering,
because, you know, in this one thing...

02:23.280 --> 02:25.320
[in Norwegian]   When the children
sit one after the other,

02:25.400 --> 02:27.560
I've read that that's good,
the usual type.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.880
- [in English] Honey, I...
-  But the child that sits behind...

02:29.960 --> 02:31.760
[in English]
You know, the baby is behind?

02:31.840 --> 02:33.800
[in Norwegian]
It can feel a bit neglected.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.320
[in English]
So, I think this is so hard.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.760
I can't really concentrate right now.
Can we do this tonight?

02:39.840 --> 02:42.680
- Okay. Then we talk about it later.
- Yeah. Love you, too.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.680
So, where is this party by the way?

02:47.760 --> 02:50.760
[in Norwegian] At some cabin
Thomas Aune has rented at Hafjell.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.280
[in English]
Hafjell. That's where he's hiding out?

02:52.360 --> 02:54.320
[in Norwegian]
Didn't you hear?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.880
He got a conviction
for some kind of insider-deal,

02:56.960 --> 03:00.360
has to wear one of those
ankle monitor things.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.200
- [in English] Are you kidding me?
- No.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.960
[in Norwegian] He can't move
more than 20 meters

03:04.040 --> 03:05.720
from his cabin or he'll be locked up.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.600
[in English]
He goes straight to jail.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.200
- That sounds like our Tommy boy.
- Yeah.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.200
[muffled music, chattering inside house]

03:22.600 --> 03:25.160
[music, chattering stops]

03:37.600 --> 03:38.800
Hey!

03:40.000 --> 03:43.280
[in Norwegian] Oh Jesus!
I thought it was my parole officer.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.560
[in English]
Welcome to Honolulu, guys.

03:45.640 --> 03:46.960
[in Norwegian]
False alarm!

03:47.040 --> 03:49.120
- [people cheering]
- [music resumes]

03:50.760 --> 03:52.160
[in English]
Good, good.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.800
[in Norwegian]
Good atmosphere in this cell of yours.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.240
It's getting better.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.960
[in English]
Fourteen days to go...

04:11.040 --> 04:13.880
[in Norwegian] What are you doing?
That's a Bård Breivik. Cost me 40 grand.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.520
Forty thousand for an ashtray?
Are you an idiot or something?

04:17.600 --> 04:20.760
That sculpture is probably
worth around 80 now,

04:20.840 --> 04:22.920
so I don't know who's the idiot here.

04:25.600 --> 04:31.680
[in English] This art thing... the value
tends to appreciate pretty good, huh?

04:31.760 --> 04:33.760
If it's the right art.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.160
[in English]
Club's been doing better.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.040
We could use a little investment.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.680
Under the radar, so to speak.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.280
Yeah. Money laundering.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.040
[in Norwegian]
If you've heard of that.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.600
[in English] You have to hook you up
with my art dealer in Oslo.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.120
My man, Max.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.560
Good. Go talk to him.

05:01.640 --> 05:04.880
Hmm? But I...

05:04.960 --> 05:08.120
[in Norwegian]
What the hell do I know about art?

05:08.200 --> 05:10.320
[in English]
What's there to know?

05:10.400 --> 05:14.480
You buy stuff that costs more
when you sell it.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.080
[Joey Ramone's "Maria Bartiromo" playing]

06:13.920 --> 06:15.720
First time in the Big Apple?

06:15.800 --> 06:17.400
How did you guess?

06:17.480 --> 06:20.280
[chuckles]
The fanny pack's a giveaway.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.680
Yeah, right.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.480
So, what'd they book you for?

06:25.560 --> 06:29.440
Oh, no, no, no. You see,
I'm a policeman, you know, from Norway.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.760
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.760
[detective] Okay.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.520
Yeah, well, that's me.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.160
Well, have fun.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.080
Hello.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.320
Thank you for taking time to see me.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.520
It's not everyday I get calls
from European colleagues.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.720
- I brought donuts.
- No, thanks.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.320
I'm on a low-carb diet.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.600
Yeah, I see.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.400
What's this case
you wanna talk about?

06:59.480 --> 07:02.920
A couple of months ago,
a stranger shows up in my hometown.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.880
A white, Caucasian male.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.520
My gut says that he is kind of fishy,
you know.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.760
First I think, terrorist.
But now, Mafia.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.240
Maybe you guys have a file on him.

07:19.280 --> 07:23.080
Nope, never seen the guy before.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.240
- I'm sorry, I couldn't help you.
- Well, okay.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.520
But do you know where I can find
this Mafia type,

07:28.600 --> 07:30.240
where they hang out and stuff?

07:30.320 --> 07:31.960
If you want to do street work
in our jurisdiction,

07:32.040 --> 07:34.880
your department needs to send
a formal request.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.520
[phone ringing]

07:56.080 --> 07:57.120
Yeah.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.520
Look, this cop from overseas

07:58.600 --> 08:00.520
just stopped by with some
interesting information

08:00.600 --> 08:02.320
about our friend, the Fixer.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.360
Oh, yeah?

08:03.440 --> 08:04.880
Yeah, it seems like Tagliano is

08:04.960 --> 08:08.160
maybe not so "disappeared" after all.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.720
Motherfucker.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.520
[in Norwegian] I was just wondering
where you'd got to.

08:31.600 --> 08:37.440
[in English] I'm sorry. Uh...
The new inventory came in...

08:37.520 --> 08:39.440
and I'm stuck here at work.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.680
[in Norwegian]
But when will you get back?

08:40.760 --> 08:43.720
[in English] Oh, you know how it is.
These things can take all night.

08:43.800 --> 08:46.680
- Okay.
- Don't wait up, huh?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.840
-  All right?
- Okay.

-  I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

Looks good.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.920
You know what? Uh...

09:20.000 --> 09:25.160
I'm not interested in any soliciting,
if that's your plan.

09:25.240 --> 09:28.120
What? A girl can't ask a guy
for a donut anymore?

09:28.200 --> 09:31.880
- You want a donut? Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.920
So, how did your meeting go?

09:40.680 --> 09:41.840
That bad, huh?

09:41.920 --> 09:43.280
Yeah.

09:43.360 --> 09:48.120
You know, I have a suspect
who I think is in the Mafia,

09:48.200 --> 09:50.520
but the police,
they won't give me any clues.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.000
Ooh, maybe I can help you.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.680
How?

09:53.760 --> 09:56.280
I know a couple of places
these wise guys hang out.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.360
If you buy me dinner,
I'll take you there.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.040
I don't know.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.320
What? You got any other leads?

10:05.680 --> 10:06.760
No.

MAIN ENTRANCE

10:42.000 --> 10:43.760
[in Norwegian]
I haven't seen liver values like this

10:43.840 --> 10:45.040
since I had a practice in Finnmark.

10:45.120 --> 10:48.280
I've probably been overdoing things
a bit lately, yes.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.000
But otherwise it all seems good.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.240
That's good to hear.
Was sure that there was

10:52.320 --> 10:54.520
something seriously wrong with me.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.880
Breathe in.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.320
Yes.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.320
That mole there.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.640
Where?

11:06.720 --> 11:09.440
- The contours are a bit diffused.
- Which one?

11:09.520 --> 11:12.720
I think we should remove it
and send it to be analyzed.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.880
Fuck.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.000
I knew it. I knew something wasn't right.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.960
Well, we do these all the time.

11:20.040 --> 11:24.240
Better to check it out once too often
rather than once too few.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.840
So it's cancer?

11:28.920 --> 11:30.600
How long do I have left?

11:30.680 --> 11:33.000
I really think you're jumping
to conclusions much too quickly.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.760
You don't have to try to put this gently.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.680
Some things you just know.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.720
It's not certain that anything's wrong.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.080
Fuck.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.520
There's...

11:52.600 --> 11:56.360
There's no easy way to say this, my girl.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.320
You're not going to take away
my MasterCard?

12:00.400 --> 12:02.400
No, no.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.120
Your Dad...

12:07.240 --> 12:11.080
has most probably been
diagnosed with cancer.

12:18.120 --> 12:22.640
I'm going to sell out of Belleview.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.000
Carpe diem, as they say,

12:25.080 --> 12:28.160
and I want to dedicate myself
to my little family.

12:32.560 --> 12:36.400
It's just such a shame Olav isn't here.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.640
[Sigrid]
There's a strange smell here.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.960
[in English]
Alcohol, maybe?

12:42.040 --> 12:44.440
Is it from you or...

12:44.520 --> 12:47.160
Uh... It's the new inventory.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.000
You know, I just taste of it.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.800
It's probably your condition,
making your nose more sensitive.

12:52.880 --> 12:56.080
[in Norwegian]
Well, it certainly is strong.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.880
[in English]
How's that pregnant yoga thing going?

13:02.960 --> 13:04.880
[in Norwegian]
Next week it's birth exercises.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.000
[in English] We should practice
to give birth, so then you have to come.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.440
- What?
- Yeah?

13:10.520 --> 13:11.920
[in Norwegian]
You must come with me.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.680
- [in English] Me?
-  Yes.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.400
Look, there's a limit to what a man can do
and still be a man.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.120
And I'm not crossing that line.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.960
[in Norwegian]
You're coming, I'm telling you.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.280
[in English] Get in there.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.640
- [in Norwegian] Hi.
- Hi. How can I be of assistance?

13:24.720 --> 13:27.200
We're looking for
a baby carriage for twins.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.960
Well, we can sure help you with that.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.760
If I had to choose, I'd go for this one,
the TK Twinner Twist.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.600
- Yes, I've read about that one.
- Yes, indeed, it wins every test,

13:35.680 --> 13:38.800
and it's very easy to fold and open again.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.720
[in English]
It's very easy to fold together

13:40.800 --> 13:43.240
- and it's got very good reviews.
- Hmm.

13:43.320 --> 13:47.280
[in Norwegian] It is rather expensive, but
this is like the Rolls Royce of the range.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.160
[in English] How much?

13:49.240 --> 13:53.560
[in Norwegian]
It comes to about 12,000, plus tax.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.120
[in English] Twelve grand?

13:57.200 --> 13:59.520
Yes.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.160
We got a little misunderstanding
here, my friend.

14:01.240 --> 14:06.000
You see, we already have the babies,
we just need the carriage.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.960
[in Norwegian]
We do have simpler models.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.400
- But I like this one.
- Yes?

14:12.480 --> 14:14.920
[in English]
I really like it.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.680
- This one?
- Yes. Don't you?

14:24.320 --> 14:25.920
You're not going to regret this.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.280
Hey, I'm fine.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.120
We just got to keep an eye on these kids
being spoiled too soon, that's all.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.600
[in Norwegian]
Yeah, yeah.

14:31.680 --> 14:35.080
[in English]
Yes, but don't you think you should...

14:35.160 --> 14:36.360
Just...

14:36.440 --> 14:38.640
[in Norwegian]
You have to sort of lift it over.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.840
[in English] It's just a little tight,
'cause its new...

14:40.920 --> 14:43.080
- No!
- Shit.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.240
[in Norwegian]
Have you broken it?

14:45.320 --> 14:48.080
- [in English] Motherfucker.
- [in Norwegian] Let me see.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.040
Can't you be a little careful?

14:50.120 --> 14:51.960
[in English]
Take it easy.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.760
[in Norwegian]
You broke off the whole part.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.520
[in English] It's okay, it's okay.
Just take it easy, take it easy.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.120
Twelve grand.

15:03.200 --> 15:07.120
It didn't last five minutes.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.120
[in Norwegian] Did you try to put it
together without the folder-lever?

15:10.200 --> 15:13.360
[in English]
Look, I'll cover the repair, all right?

15:13.440 --> 15:15.000
Just give me a new one.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.480
I'm sorry that's not possible.
This was the last one.

15:17.560 --> 15:21.320
What are you talking about?
There's one right there.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.840
Oh, no. That's just a display model.
It's not for sale.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.680
Uh... but this one is also nice.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.920
Oh, you sell me the Rolls, and now
the Volkswagen is suddenly okay?

15:31.000 --> 15:35.200
I'll cover the repair,
that weenie-twister is coming with me!

15:35.280 --> 15:37.040
[in Norwegian]
Hey. No, no, no.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.120
No, no, no.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.360
[in English]
Let go of that weenie-twister!

15:42.440 --> 15:43.920
[in Norwegian]
Chris! Call security!

15:44.000 --> 15:46.200
- Gimme that thing!
- Call security.­

15:46.280 --> 15:50.000
- No!
- I'm warning you!

15:50.080 --> 15:53.480
[alarm blaring]

15:58.640 --> 16:01.200
Gimme whatever you got.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.600
[alarm continuing]

16:05.560 --> 16:07.480
What a day.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.720
- [sniffling]
- [car door closes]

16:23.440 --> 16:27.760
You know, maybe I'll go
to that yoga class, after all.

16:29.680 --> 16:30.880
Okay.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.280
That make you happy?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.600
[crying, in Norwegian]
A little.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.000
Here's your coffee.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.840
Oh, sorry,

17:00.920 --> 17:02.960
I was so involved in the art.

17:04.080 --> 17:08.000
Those are wallpaper samples.

17:10.640 --> 17:14.400
Right.
They're very nice anyway.

17:15.600 --> 17:21.040
So what type of art is it you are after?

17:21.120 --> 17:23.320
I'm after the type that's worth more

17:23.400 --> 17:26.320
when you sell it than when you buy it.

17:28.280 --> 17:33.480
I see. So you don't have
any aesthetic preferences?

17:33.560 --> 17:36.160
No. The important thing is

17:36.240 --> 17:42.840
that the financing is done
outside the box, sort of.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.880
Yes, I understood that on the phone.

17:44.960 --> 17:49.240
But don't you have a particular artist
in mind? No inclinations?

17:49.320 --> 17:54.720
No, just so long as
it's around 300 grand.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.280
Three-hundred...

17:56.360 --> 17:58.520
Three-hundred thousand.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.640
Okay. Just to start somewhere,

18:07.720 --> 18:11.960
we have a Melgaard painting in
at the moment.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.680
Never heard of him.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.800
- No?
- Who is that?

18:14.880 --> 18:19.240
Bjarne Melgaard is one of Norway's
most renowned contemporary artists.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.840
Doesn't really ring a bell.

18:21.920 --> 18:27.040
How's he when it comes to price
and increase in value and stuff?

18:27.120 --> 18:30.200
The picture costs 280,000.

18:30.280 --> 18:33.640
You can probably sell for twice that
in about five years.

18:33.720 --> 18:37.840
Perfect. I'll take that one. I'll buy it.

18:37.920 --> 18:41.520
Okay?
You don't want to see the picture?

18:41.600 --> 18:44.560
I'm leaving this to you professionals.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.640
Certainly.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.280
Just pack it up,
and I'll take it with me.

18:53.880 --> 18:57.520
[operatic requiem playing over computer]

19:05.080 --> 19:07.080
[footsteps approach]

19:07.160 --> 19:08.720
Are you going out, Olympia?

19:11.360 --> 19:12.920
Olav?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.960
Hi, Dad.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.440
Hi.

19:17.520 --> 19:21.320
What does this mean?
Are you home again for good now?

19:21.400 --> 19:27.200
I've spoken to Olympia.
She told me about your condition.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.400
Maybe there's some meaning
to this after all.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.000
If you could just grab the back...

19:38.080 --> 19:39.840
Hey, boss, take a look.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.640
[in English] I got no time. We got
an emergency with the Belleview project.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.720
The art has arrived, that you bought.

19:45.800 --> 19:46.880
Eh?

19:55.400 --> 19:57.800
What is it?

20:02.760 --> 20:04.200
I don't know.

20:04.280 --> 20:07.200
[Arne in Norwegian]
Looks like the monkey's getting a blowjob.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.160
See?

20:09.240 --> 20:12.840
[in English] Jesus Christ.
Did you spend my money

20:12.920 --> 20:15.280
on a monkey getting a blowjob?

20:15.360 --> 20:19.560
[in Norwegian]   The guy in the gallery
said this was the hottest art around.

20:19.640 --> 20:20.800
[in English] Take it back!

20:20.880 --> 20:23.000
[in Norwegian] I'm not sure about
what kind of return policy they--

20:23.080 --> 20:24.320
[in English] My return policy is,

20:24.400 --> 20:27.000
get it the fuck out of here
and get my money back!

20:27.080 --> 20:28.440
[in Norwegian]
But how am I supposed to--

20:28.520 --> 20:30.600
[in English]
Did you like working at the NAV?

20:30.680 --> 20:32.440
[in English]
I got it boss.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.120
- I got it...
- Good.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.440
Richard.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.120
Where's Julius, is he coming?

20:41.200 --> 20:43.040
[in Norwegian]
I haven't heard from him at all.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.080
- We'd better just begin.
- Hmm.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.200
[line ringing]

20:49.120 --> 20:50.600
Hi there, guys.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.160
[in English]
How's your form, Johnny boy?

20:53.240 --> 20:55.800
That was a pretty wild party, eh?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.880
Stop dwelling on the past, jailbird.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.920
[in Norwegian] You were so secretive
on the phone, what is this about?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.360
Well, first I want to welcome you

21:04.440 --> 21:08.560
to this board meeting
in Sjusjøen Belleview.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.600
[in English] What board meeting?
You left the board when I joined.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.840
[in Norwegian]
Yeah, yeah, but the way it is now,

21:13.920 --> 21:18.320
Julius Backe had to pull out
for personal reasons.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.160
[in English]
So, Julius sold his shares.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.680
What? Julius can't sell
without talking to us.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.960
But relax, it's in the best of hands.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.920
[in Norwegian]
Has Julius sold his share to you?

21:31.000 --> 21:35.360
An investment group comprised
of local business people,

21:35.440 --> 21:38.760
with yours truly as a kind of front man.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.440
The team up here have
a slightly different vision, and they want

21:41.520 --> 21:46.560
more focus on family friendly activities,
like skiing and a water park.

21:46.640 --> 21:50.360
"   Sjusjøen Belleview, Eldorado for kids."

21:50.440 --> 21:52.120
[in English]
I got a penthouse in this thing.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.040
I don't plan on living in Disneyland.

21:54.120 --> 21:57.440
[in Norwegian]
We happen to be the majority shareholder.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.400
That's what makes business so exciting.

22:00.480 --> 22:04.120
Sometimes you have to compromise.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.040
[in Norwegian] Hello?

22:53.320 --> 22:55.880
Excuse me. Hey there.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.080
Hang it over there. Yes?

22:58.160 --> 23:00.960
I've got some art here
I want to get rid of.

23:01.040 --> 23:05.400
Indeed? What are we talking about?
Is it a print,

23:05.480 --> 23:08.000
photograph, painting?

23:08.080 --> 23:11.280
It's some kind of drawing.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.560
Quite.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.400
Let's see.

23:21.440 --> 23:26.040
- But this is a Melgaard.
- Yeah, it's fuckin' exclusive.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.960
This is something we'd be
most interested in.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.760
That's great.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.720
But let's put a price down on the table,
I ain't selling this

23:31.800 --> 23:34.200
to anybody for any price.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.080
I shall get our expert on modern art
to give you a valuation.

23:37.160 --> 23:40.640
Sounds good. Be careful.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.280
Yes.

23:50.040 --> 23:53.200
[in English] What the fuck are you up to
with the Belleview project?

23:53.280 --> 23:56.160
[in Norwegian]   I've had to sell out in
order to deal with some family problems.

23:56.240 --> 23:58.920
[in English] Bullshit!
I made the deal with you!

23:59.000 --> 24:02.320
Not some hillbillies trying
to turn the place into fucking Aqualand!

24:02.400 --> 24:04.240
Well, the deal is done.
I'm sorry.

24:04.320 --> 24:08.200
Oh, not half as sorry as you're gonna be,
you whining, fucking cocksucker!

24:08.280 --> 24:10.240
You really wanna fuck with me?

24:10.320 --> 24:12.600
[in Norwegian]
You can't talk like that to my father!

24:12.680 --> 24:15.400
[in English] Relax, Osama,
it's between me and your father.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.000
[in Norwegian] Do you have no respect?
The man is sick!

24:18.080 --> 24:19.720
[in English]
What's he saying?

24:22.440 --> 24:24.920
Come on! What are you saying?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.360
He's got cancer.

24:36.720 --> 24:40.560
Jesus.
Why didn't you say something?

24:40.640 --> 24:44.160
[in Norwegian]
I don't like to be a burden to people.

24:44.280 --> 24:47.160
- [in English] Fuck.
- [phone ringing]

24:47.240 --> 24:49.760
[Olav in Norwegian] Dad, it's for you.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.800
Then tell them that I'm out.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.240
Dr. Utsi.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.600
I'm ready.

25:05.680 --> 25:09.200
What's the prognosis?

25:09.280 --> 25:11.120
Prognosis?

25:11.200 --> 25:15.520
Yes, how long have I got left?

25:15.600 --> 25:18.400
No, listen, the tests are completely fine.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.360
What?

25:24.040 --> 25:25.840
I don't understand.

25:25.920 --> 25:30.240
Is the cancer less aggressive
than first assumed?

25:30.320 --> 25:33.800
What I'm saying is
that you don't have cancer.

25:33.880 --> 25:37.040
But what about the diffused contours?

25:37.120 --> 25:40.280
What about my father's medical record?

25:40.360 --> 25:44.360
Yes, all that was a cause of concern.
But now it's all been checked.

25:44.440 --> 25:48.000
Jesus. What the fuck do I do now, then?

25:48.080 --> 25:51.120
Look, this is good news, Julius.

25:51.200 --> 25:56.000
Good news... Oh, yes.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.200
[Olav] What did he say?

26:14.280 --> 26:15.880
Hmm?

26:15.960 --> 26:18.760
What did Dr. Utsi say?

26:18.840 --> 26:23.560
No, he... What should I say...

26:25.040 --> 26:27.480
It's pretty much what we had expected.

26:27.560 --> 26:31.200
We're going to do some more tests,
then we'll see.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.880
[in English]
This Dr. Tutsy...

26:33.960 --> 26:35.160
Dr. Utsi?

26:35.240 --> 26:36.960
- He's from Lapland.
- Lapland, huh?

26:37.040 --> 26:38.600
He's good, huh?

26:38.680 --> 26:39.840
Yeah, he's good.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.280
Well...

26:44.920 --> 26:49.600
If there's anything I can do, okay,
don't hesitate to call.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.880
Oh, thank you, Johnny.
Thank you for being so generous.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.320
All right.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.040
[footsteps approaching]

27:04.120 --> 27:05.800
[in Norwegian]
About time.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.840
Well, what's the price?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.320
We have a problem.

27:09.400 --> 27:13.120
We've checked the register, and it appears
that this picture was stolen last year.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.680
What?

27:14.760 --> 27:16.880
Yes, so we've had to alert
the authorities.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.520
This...

27:21.600 --> 27:26.440
This is just stupid. Get the painting,
and I'll go to another shop.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.760
It's not that simple.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.960
The police are on their way to collect
the painting and return it

27:31.040 --> 27:33.440
- to its rightful owner.
- Rightful owner?

27:33.520 --> 27:36.560
But I bought that from Gallery Air
for several hundred thousand.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.680
Then it's just a matter
of presenting the papers.

27:38.760 --> 27:42.680
What do you mean "papers"?
Which papers?

27:42.760 --> 27:44.520
You surely must have

27:44.600 --> 27:47.200
documents relating to a purchase
of this magnitude?

27:47.280 --> 27:49.520
Otherwise, I rather think the police will

27:49.600 --> 27:52.320
be wanting to have a word with you, too.

27:52.400 --> 27:56.400
But of course I've got papers.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.120
Good.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.200
- [Johnny] Yeah, Torgeir.
- Yeah.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.400
- Talk to me.
- Yeah.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.240
[in Norwegian]
The monkey picture was stolen.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.480
[in English]
They stole my monkey?

28:42.560 --> 28:44.440
[in Norwegian]
No, it was stolen when we bought it.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.960
[in English]
Motherfucker!

28:46.040 --> 28:48.320
I've been talking to the people here,

28:48.400 --> 28:51.720
and the guy that sold it to us is gonna be
back in a couple of hours. So...

28:51.800 --> 28:53.920
[in English] You stay there,
you hear me? I'm coming.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.600
Sure. Okay, boss.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.040
You're doing me a favor tonight.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.360
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.800
[in Norwegian]
Are you ready?

28:59.880 --> 29:01.440
- [in English] Yeah.
- Yeah?

29:01.520 --> 29:02.880
- Yeah, I was really ready.
- Yeah...

29:02.960 --> 29:04.560
- I was looking forward to this...
- [in Norwegian] Good.

29:04.640 --> 29:07.440
Torgeir just called.
I got an emergency, I gotta run.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.280
The good news is,
Arnie's gonna take you. Okay?

29:10.360 --> 29:13.160
[in Norwegian]
He's taking me to yoga class?

29:13.240 --> 29:14.680
[in English] Yeah,
he's gonna take you to yoga--

29:14.760 --> 29:16.280
[in Norwegian]
Oh, come on.

29:16.360 --> 29:19.280
[in English] He's gonna buy you
dinner first, okay? On me. I gotta go.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.200
- [in Norwegian] You can't just leave!
- [in English] It's gonna be great.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.800
[in Norwegian]
I can't go to yoga class with Arne!

29:35.120 --> 29:37.880
- [in English] Okay.
- Excuse me?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.960
You the European cop who was looking
for some wise guy?

29:40.040 --> 29:41.880
Yeah, maybe.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.200
I got a pal who runs a joint,
a couple of blocks from here,

29:43.280 --> 29:45.520
who can help you out.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.960
How do you know
what my friend's looking for?

29:47.040 --> 29:49.000
What the fuck do you care?
Take a hike, sister.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.400
Come on, man. I'm getting bad vibes,
let's get out of here.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.760
You're not going anywhere.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.160
[music blaring]

30:07.200 --> 30:08.920
[turns off music]

30:10.320 --> 30:12.720
[Torgeir in Norwegian]
Fucking Oslo prick.

30:12.800 --> 30:13.800
[Johnny in English]
You owe me money.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.480
[in Norwegian]
You con me into buying a pervo-picture,

30:16.560 --> 30:19.000
and on top of that, it turns out
to be stolen. Huh? Huh?

30:22.240 --> 30:25.680
[stammering] Please.
I'm just a middleman.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.560
[in English]
I just got a cut!

30:27.640 --> 30:31.520
[in English] We need you to tell us
who hired you to sell that painting.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.560
[in Norwegian]
I can't remember.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.560
[in English]
I've worked with so many...

30:44.120 --> 30:49.120
I'm gonna mention a name now.
Van Gogh. You know that name?

30:49.200 --> 30:50.720
Vincent van Gogh.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.000
That's the one.

30:52.080 --> 30:57.200
You're gonna cooperate
or you're gonna look just like him.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.320
[wailing]

30:59.400 --> 31:00.720
Okay, okay, okay.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.360
It's a guy from Lillehammer.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.640
Thomas Aune.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.880
[Torgeir] That fucker.

31:14.160 --> 31:16.720
[in English] Motherfucker.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.400
[Torgeir] Motherfucker.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.480
Motherfucker!

31:27.920 --> 31:30.280
What's that?

31:30.360 --> 31:33.520
It's an installation about how
society treats animals.

31:33.600 --> 31:37.280
No, no, no, no. What's the carriage?
Is that a weenie-twister?

31:37.360 --> 31:39.760
I...
I don't know. I don't know.

31:39.840 --> 31:43.280
That goes with us.
Lose the meat.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.240
You can't just take it. Sorry.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.520
You don't mind if that
goes with us, do you?

31:48.600 --> 31:51.160
- Please, be my guest.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.360
[in Norwegian] And when
a labor contraction occurs,

32:02.440 --> 32:04.840
we do doggy-breathing. Off we go.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.200
[participants panting]

32:07.280 --> 32:08.720
Dads, too.

32:19.640 --> 32:24.240
[chanting]

32:28.680 --> 32:29.720
Hey!

32:31.320 --> 32:33.000
[in English] First of all,

32:33.080 --> 32:37.200
what kind of a putz takes a Jacuzzi
in this kind of weather?

32:37.280 --> 32:40.480
- Uh...
- Get the fuck down!

32:40.560 --> 32:44.920
And second,
where's my monkey?

32:45.000 --> 32:49.280
You know what? He called me.
He called me, the gallerist from Oslo.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.280
And they told me it was a misunderstanding
with the painting.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.640
Oh, really?

32:53.720 --> 32:55.080
I promise you, I didn't plan to sell it,

32:55.160 --> 32:59.000
but then the Belleview project come up,
and you know how that works--

32:59.080 --> 33:01.640
So you fucked me
over with the painting,

33:01.720 --> 33:04.080
so you could fuck me over
with the Belleview project.

33:04.160 --> 33:07.360
- Is that about it, Tommy boy?
- No. It's Max. The idiot, Max.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.080
He never should have sold it to you guys.
You're my friends.

33:10.160 --> 33:13.920
- But that's what happened.
- Where's his monkey, bitch!

33:14.000 --> 33:16.520
- [in Norwegian] I don't have it.
- Don't give me that!

33:16.600 --> 33:17.800
[in English]
I don't have it.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.560
[in Norwegian] The gallery people said
they were gonna hand it back.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.680
[in English] I sure don't have it.
So, I'm sorry, guys.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.120
I think it's time for a little walk.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.760
[in Norwegian]
No!

33:31.840 --> 33:34.480
[in English]
Guys, I go to jail.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.680
If I go out any longer, I go to jail.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.880
I want my monkey.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.640
Not any further.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.800
Johnny wants his monkey!

33:43.960 --> 33:47.160
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.400
Okay, what?

33:51.480 --> 33:53.880
[in Norwegian]
It's behind the oven in the sauna.

33:53.960 --> 33:57.120
[in English]
It's in the sauna.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.480
That's the truth?

33:58.560 --> 34:00.480
Yeah. Let me go.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.800
Let him go.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.160
No!

34:07.760 --> 34:09.400
[in Norwegian]
Fuck it!

34:17.480 --> 34:21.760
Where's that piece of shit
Frank Tagliano hiding, huh?

34:21.840 --> 34:24.200
You were dying to talk about him
a little while ago,

34:24.280 --> 34:26.640
and now you fucking clam up?

34:26.720 --> 34:29.120
- [Deshawna moaning]
- [mutters] What the fuck.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.240
[moaning]

34:31.320 --> 34:32.920
Shut her up.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.960
- Easy, Jerry. Easy there...
- You're gonna pay for that, bitch!

34:47.040 --> 34:49.640
- Put the gun down!
- You fucking perv!

34:49.720 --> 34:51.040
Put the gun down.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.760
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
Put the...

34:52.840 --> 34:54.600
- Fucking perv!
- Jerry, put the gun down.

34:54.680 --> 34:57.400
[yelling]

35:00.240 --> 35:02.320

- [gasps]

35:05.720 --> 35:07.240
[indistinct arguing]

35:17.280 --> 35:21.160
[in Norwegian] Welcome to Sinatra Night
here at Flamingo.

35:21.240 --> 35:25.920
I can see that everybody's got
something to drink.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.600
That made me think of a quote
that an old friend of Blue Eyes...

35:30.680 --> 35:33.240
Sorry, buddy,
there's a dress code here tonight.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.480
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

35:35.560 --> 35:40.280
The point is this is a theme night,
and this isn't exactly the theme.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.880
He said,

35:41.960 --> 35:46.080
[in English] "I pity the fool
who doesn't drink

35:46.160 --> 35:49.600
because every time
they wake up in the morning,

35:49.680 --> 35:53.800
that's the best they ever gonna feel...
That day."

35:53.880 --> 35:55.880
- [drummer plays]
- Ha ha!

35:55.960 --> 35:57.320
[in Norwegian] This decorative
sweater is worth more...

35:57.400 --> 35:58.760
[in English] Is there a problem here?

35:58.840 --> 36:01.480
This gorilla won't let me in.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.280
I wonder why.
You look like Halloween.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.920
I'm wearing traditional Sami clothing.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.800
You might be the king of the Eskimos,
but we have a dress code here.

36:10.880 --> 36:13.480
[in Norwegian] I've been honored
for my work as a doctor in this town,

36:13.560 --> 36:17.280
and now I'm being refused entry
because I'm from Lapland.

36:17.360 --> 36:20.040
[in English] Yeah, I don't really care...

36:20.120 --> 36:22.360
Did you say you were
a doctor from Lapland?

36:22.440 --> 36:23.880
[in Norwegian]
Yes.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.560
[in English] By any chance,
would you happen to be

36:27.640 --> 36:30.240
the doctor of Mr. Julius Backe?

36:30.320 --> 36:32.120
[in Norwegian] Yes, indeed.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.080
[in English] You're all right.
Arnie, he's all right.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.920
You're in.
Let me buy you a drink.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.240
Now you say you are a friend of Julius.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.280
Try that.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.320
[in Norwegian]
Is that a genuine Melgaard painting?

36:52.400 --> 36:55.080
- [in English] You like his stuff?
- It's fantastic!

36:58.400 --> 37:02.760
Well, you know, for a price,
it could be back on the market.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.080
I don't have that kind of money.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.520
Shame about Juli, huh?

37:12.600 --> 37:14.680
[in Norwegian]
What do you mean?

37:14.760 --> 37:18.200
You know, I guess
he didn't catch it fast enough.

37:18.280 --> 37:21.560
His tests, they were fine.

37:23.760 --> 37:27.160
Fine? That guy's got the big C.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.160
I mean, terminal, no?

37:30.960 --> 37:35.640
[in Norwegian] Well... I am bound
to professional secrecy.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.280
[in English] Son of a bitch.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.040
I didn't say anything.

37:42.120 --> 37:48.160
Before you go, I got a little
business proposition for you.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.160
- [Deshawna] Are you hurt?
- [Geir mutters]

37:56.480 --> 37:58.200
Geir?

38:02.200 --> 38:03.600
Laila?

38:05.080 --> 38:06.920
[in Norwegian]
Is that you, Laila?

38:11.080 --> 38:13.040
[in English] Geir?

38:13.960 --> 38:16.800
[Deshawna]  It was two guys.
Italian-American.

38:16.880 --> 38:20.120
One short, grey hair.
The other one, younger. Dark hair.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.040
I can come to the station,
help you do the drawing.

38:22.120 --> 38:24.000
No, no. You've been
more than helpful.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.040
Now go get yourself a warm beverage.

38:33.120 --> 38:37.160
Hey, Lieutenant. Yeah,
I'm at the crime scene now.

38:37.240 --> 38:42.960
Yeah, some hillbilly tourist who was here
visiting one of the regulars, Deshawna.

38:43.040 --> 38:46.280
Yeah, probably buying drugs.
Yeah.

38:46.360 --> 38:49.240
As per usual,
nobody's seen or heard anything.

38:49.320 --> 38:53.480
I'm afraid this is gonna end up
right in the pile of unsolved cases.

38:53.560 --> 38:56.440
[in Norwegian]
He's fucking crazy.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.800
[doorbell rings]

39:01.280 --> 39:04.640
It's not really a good time
for a call tonight, Johnny.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.240
[in English] I figured you might be gone
tomorrow, so we better talk now.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.040
Okay.

39:10.120 --> 39:15.040
I got a solution to the Belleview project.
You're gonna buy me out.

39:15.120 --> 39:19.400
But I already just sold my share
because of, you know what.

39:19.480 --> 39:23.280
[in English] Yeah, you're gonna take
that money you got from Tommy boy

39:23.360 --> 39:25.160
and give it to me for my piece.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.800
[in Norwegian] But my share was
four times the size of yours.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.960
[in English] Come on,
that doesn't make sense.

39:31.480 --> 39:35.000
A lot of things
don't make sense, you know.

39:35.080 --> 39:38.360
Like your medical records, for instance.

39:40.480 --> 39:44.000
Where the fuck did you get this one?

39:44.080 --> 39:46.320
It's not important where I got it, Juli.

39:46.400 --> 39:50.080
What's important is what your kids
are gonna say when I show it to them.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.720
No, no. Come on, please.

39:52.800 --> 39:57.120
[in Norwegian] You've got to understand,
Johnny, at first I thought I was ill...

39:57.200 --> 40:01.160
Then Olav came home, and I was given
a fresh start with my kids.

40:01.240 --> 40:05.840
[in English] Juli, you're mixing me up
with somebody who gives a fuck.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.840
Just sign over the money, eh?

40:07.960 --> 40:09.720
[in Norwegian]
What a fucking idiot, I...

40:09.800 --> 40:12.720
[in English] You really don't want
your kids knowing the truth, do you?

40:21.560 --> 40:23.880
- [Dr. Utsi]  Yeah.
-  We're ready for you now.

40:28.080 --> 40:30.040
Sorry to disturb you guys.

40:30.120 --> 40:34.120
But I ran into the doc and he has
some news that just won't wait.

40:34.200 --> 40:39.080
[in Norwegian] Well, as we all know
Julius has been diagnosed with cancer.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.280
We've done some new tests,

40:43.360 --> 40:46.320
it seems the cancer
is in the process of receding.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.960
- Receding?
- Yes.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.280
It looks as if he is going to make
a complete recovery.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.920
[chuckles]

40:53.000 --> 40:56.440
This is almost like a miracle.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.600
It must be all the care from you.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.680
- [audience applauding]
- [Torgeir] Yeah!

41:15.760 --> 41:17.760
[cheering]

41:17.840 --> 41:23.360
[in Norwegian] I've got a boss who loves
Sinatra, who's a big Sinatra fan.

41:23.440 --> 41:27.000
And because of that, the band has

41:27.080 --> 41:31.200
prepared a tune that we thought we'd

41:31.280 --> 41:33.920
hear if...

41:34.000 --> 41:37.320
[in English]
What do you feel, boss?

41:37.400 --> 41:38.720
Take the challenge?

41:38.800 --> 41:40.440
What? Me?

41:40.520 --> 41:41.560
Yeah.

41:41.640 --> 41:42.640
Nah.

41:42.720 --> 41:44.320
Oh, come on.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.840
- No, I can't no...
-  Johnny.
