You just want to
get back to work.

08:40.611 --> 08:45.776
There are five stages to
grief, which are denial, anger,

08:45.776 --> 08:48.999
bargaining, depression,
and acceptance.

08:48.999 --> 08:51.882
And right now out
there they are all

08:51.882 --> 08:54.655
denying the fact
that they're sad.

08:54.655 --> 08:57.007
And that's hard.

08:57.007 --> 08:59.840
And it's making them all angry.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.633
And it is my job
to try to get them

09:02.633 --> 09:05.576
all the way through
to acceptance.

09:05.576 --> 09:08.298
And if not acceptance,
then just depression.

09:08.298 --> 09:11.572
If I can get them depressed,
then I'll have done my job.

09:11.572 --> 09:13.383
I'm going to throw
you this ball.

09:13.383 --> 09:17.397
When you catch the ball, I want
you to say the name of a person

09:17.397 --> 09:21.271
very important to, somebody
really special, who died.

09:21.271 --> 09:23.994
And then I want you
to say how they died.

09:23.994 --> 09:25.856
And you may cry if you like.

09:25.856 --> 09:26.837
That is encouraged.

09:26.837 --> 09:27.898
Let me just start.

09:27.898 --> 09:29.299
Let me show you how this works.

09:29.299 --> 09:31.221
I catch the ball.

09:31.221 --> 09:32.583
I lost Ed Truck.

09:32.583 --> 09:36.456
And it feels like
somebody took my heart

09:36.456 --> 09:41.161
and dropped it into a
bucket of boiling tears.

09:41.161 --> 09:44.705
And at the same
time somebody else

09:44.705 --> 09:52.592
is hitting my soul in the crotch
with a frozen sledgehammer.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.404
And then a third guy
walks in and starts

09:54.404 --> 09:56.456
punching me in the grief bone.

09:56.456 --> 09:58.518
And I'm crying.

09:58.518 --> 10:01.041
And nobody can
hear me because I'm

10:01.041 --> 10:05.896
terribly, terribly,
terribly alone.

10:05.896 --> 10:06.596
-Excuse me.

10:06.596 --> 10:07.367
I'm sorry to interrupt.

10:07.367 --> 10:09.079
I need to see Pam.

10:09.079 --> 10:10.210
There seems to be,
like, something

10:10.210 --> 10:12.773
wrong with her
radiator in her car.

10:12.773 --> 10:13.473
-OK.

10:13.473 --> 10:14.054
Fine.

10:14.054 --> 10:14.755
Hurry back.

10:17.828 --> 10:19.069
-There's nothing
wrong with your car.

10:19.069 --> 10:20.300
I just thought you
might want a break

10:20.300 --> 10:22.763
from the grief
counseling session.

10:22.763 --> 10:23.684
-Oh.

10:23.684 --> 10:25.786
I would like a break.

10:25.786 --> 10:27.447
-How are you liking the new car?

10:27.447 --> 10:28.148
-Great.

10:28.148 --> 10:30.440
-Yeah?

10:30.440 --> 10:33.023
It's very small.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.514

10:34.514 --> 10:36.016
-I think so.

10:36.016 --> 10:36.717

10:48.929 --> 10:52.072
Yeah, this is Mike from
the West Side Market.

10:52.072 --> 10:55.726
Well, we got a shipment of
Herr's Salt and Vinegar Chips.

10:55.726 --> 11:00.540

weeks ago and have-- yeah.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.377
-OK.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.578
We can start.

11:18.578 --> 11:19.820
-You waited for me?

11:19.820 --> 11:20.520
-Um.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.843
Yeah, Pam, you're a
member of this family.

11:22.843 --> 11:25.405
So we will wait for
our family members.

11:25.405 --> 11:26.707
Phyllis, do you want
to give it a shot?

11:26.707 --> 11:28.809
-I got it.

11:28.809 --> 11:31.772
When my mother was pregnant
with me they did an ultrasound

11:31.772 --> 11:33.914
and found she was having twins.

11:33.914 --> 11:37.287
When they did another
ultrasound a few weeks later,

11:37.287 --> 11:43.423
they discovered that I had
to resorbed the other fetus.

11:43.423 --> 11:44.725
Do I regret this?

11:44.725 --> 11:45.475
No.

11:45.475 --> 11:47.908

made me stronger.

11:47.908 --> 11:51.101

grown man and a little baby.

11:51.101 --> 11:51.802
-OK.

11:51.802 --> 11:55.195
Why don't you throw the
ball to somebody else?

11:55.195 --> 11:56.026
-Nope.
-Oh!

11:56.026 --> 11:57.037
Yes, Stanley.

11:57.037 --> 11:57.377
Come on.

11:57.928 --> 11:58.628
You have to go.

11:58.628 --> 11:59.489
-I will not.

11:59.489 --> 12:02.212
-OK.

12:02.212 --> 12:06.306
I'm going to toss
the ball to Pam.

12:06.306 --> 12:07.888
-Let's see.

12:07.888 --> 12:10.871
I had an aunt that I
was really close to.

12:10.871 --> 12:14.094
She was this amazing
female boxer.

12:14.094 --> 12:16.997
Um, anyway, she was
injured in a fight.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.199
And she was paralyzed.

12:19.199 --> 12:25.115
So you can imagine how upset I
was when I found out that she

12:25.115 --> 12:27.768
asked her manager to
remove her breathing

12:27.768 --> 12:31.201

-Wow.

-If you want to cry, that's OK.

12:41.191 --> 12:41.992
-Thanks.

12:41.992 --> 12:46.937

was on a safari in Africa.

12:46.937 --> 12:52.262
And, um, my cousin
Mufasa was, um--

12:52.262 --> 12:56.576

by a pack of wildebeests.

really hard, all of us

of what happened.

-Do you want to talk
about it anymore?

13:08.598 --> 13:11.201

me, like, an hour and a half

Um, I was trying to
throw this party once.

13:20.220 --> 13:24.935
And everyone was
over for the weekend.

13:24.935 --> 13:27.507
And then my Uncle Bernie died.

13:27.507 --> 13:31.842
And so me and my
best friend, we had

13:31.842 --> 13:34.684
to pretend like he was alive.

13:34.684 --> 13:36.006

13:36.006 --> 13:38.708
-Wait a second.

this is a game?

I saw a little bird

downstairs and die.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.836
-Dwight, do you have the box?

17:56.836 --> 17:57.657
-Actually, I have it.

18:01.311 --> 18:03.042
-You made this?

18:03.042 --> 18:05.305
Wow.

18:05.305 --> 18:07.977
That's-- that's very nice.

18:07.977 --> 18:10.180
RYAN: When I was
five, my mom told me

18:10.180 --> 18:14.264
that my fish went to the
hospital in the toilet.

18:14.264 --> 18:15.695
And it never came back.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.757
So we had a funeral for it.

18:17.757 --> 18:21.601
And I remember thinking, I'm
a little too old for this.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.953
And I was five.

18:23.953 --> 18:28.077
-I'd also like to say a
few words if that's OK.

18:28.077 --> 18:30.600
-Yes.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.423
-What do we know
about this bird?

18:33.423 --> 18:36.416
You might think not
much, it's just a bird.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.868
But we do know some things.

18:38.868 --> 18:42.292
We know it was a local bird.

18:42.292 --> 18:44.674
Maybe it's that same
bird that surprised Oscar

18:44.674 --> 18:47.197
that one morning with a
special present from above.

18:47.197 --> 18:48.148
-I remember that.

18:48.148 --> 18:49.659
That was so funny.

18:49.659 --> 18:54.734
-And we know how he died--
flying into the glass doors.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.827
But you know what, I don't
think he was being stupid.

18:57.827 --> 19:01.481
I think he just
really, really wanted

19:01.481 --> 19:05.845
to come inside our building
to spread his cheer

19:05.845 --> 19:07.777
and lift our
spirits with a song.

19:07.777 --> 19:08.688
-It's not a songbird.

19:08.688 --> 19:09.429
-Shh.

19:09.429 --> 19:11.411
-An impression then.

19:11.411 --> 19:14.694
Lastly, we can't help
but notice that he

19:14.694 --> 19:16.536
was by himself when he died.

19:16.536 --> 19:21.181
But, of course, we all know
that doesn't mean he was alone

19:21.181 --> 19:23.993
because I'm sure that there
were lots of other birds

19:23.993 --> 19:27.277
out there who cared
for him very much.

19:27.277 --> 19:28.598
He will not be forgotten.

19:28.598 --> 19:29.409
-Amen.

19:29.409 --> 19:32.832
[MUSIC PLAYING]

19:32.832 --> 19:38.258
-(SINGING) Just smile for
me and let the day begin.

19:38.258 --> 19:44.664
You are the sunshine that
lights my heart within.

19:44.664 --> 19:51.681
MICHAEL: Society teaches us
that having feelings and crying

19:51.681 --> 19:53.983
is bad and wrong.

19:53.983 --> 20:00.790
Well, that's baloney,
because grief isn't wrong.

20:00.790 --> 20:03.843
There is such a
thing as good grief.

20:03.843 --> 20:05.184
Just ask Charlie Brown.

20:09.969 --> 20:12.932
[CLAPPING]

20:12.932 --> 20:13.923
-Let's get back to work.

20:28.758 --> 20:29.999
-Guys, get a broom!

20:29.999 --> 20:32.452
Let's clean this up.

20:32.452 --> 20:33.243
Grab a broom!

20:33.243 --> 20:34.073
You heard me.

20:34.073 --> 20:35.625
Mush!
