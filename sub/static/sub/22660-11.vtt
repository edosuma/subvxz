00:53.077 --> 00:54.760
How was he?

00:55.547 --> 00:56.813
34 and change.

00:56.815 --> 00:58.281
That's not good enough.

00:58.283 --> 01:00.650
Yeah, it was good enough to
win the Derby and the Preakness.

01:00.652 --> 01:02.654
Yeah, but it's not good
enough for Belmont. I mean,

01:02.690 --> 01:05.571
that's such a long race.
He's gotta have endurance.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.336
Daksha's not back to peak yet.

01:07.456 --> 01:09.422
Just a little tired, aren't you, baby?

01:09.458 --> 01:11.498
He's more than tired, Ray, and you know it.

01:11.543 --> 01:14.507
Just give him a chance to
show you what he's made of.

01:16.016 --> 01:19.455
Alice, you know it's vital
that we win Belmont tomorrow.

01:19.501 --> 01:20.543
Yes, of course.

01:20.552 --> 01:23.077
So I need to know that
you're gonna do your best

01:23.096 --> 01:24.632
to bring home that Triple Crown.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.782
Otherwise, I'm gonna find me a new jockey

01:26.809 --> 01:28.620
faster than you can spit.

01:29.169 --> 01:31.947
Great. I always ride to win. You know that.

01:31.949 --> 01:33.633
You're gonna be making history,

01:33.679 --> 01:35.865
for Daksha and for yourself.

01:36.743 --> 01:38.801
Well... we hope.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.055
Come on...

01:40.057 --> 01:43.391
That's my girl, hm? I'll
see you at breakfast.

01:43.816 --> 01:46.160
- See you then.
- See you later, Daksha.

01:54.804 --> 01:58.223
Good boy. Good boy.

02:00.343 --> 02:02.276
(Whinnying)

02:04.872 --> 02:06.780
How'd you get out, huh?

02:15.937 --> 02:18.873
Someone's in the barn. Stay with Daksha.

02:19.349 --> 02:20.885
Okay.

02:28.211 --> 02:30.370
The horses are loose in
the barn. We need help.

02:30.373 --> 02:31.934
Okay? We need help!

02:34.976 --> 02:38.245
(Alarm ringing)

02:39.909 --> 02:41.619
Frank, look.

02:50.549 --> 02:52.860
- This is the stable.
- I see.

02:59.199 --> 03:01.655
Help! Help! Someone, help!

03:06.273 --> 03:09.749
You know what this'll do
to your face, little girl?

03:10.261 --> 03:11.576
Okay?

03:14.450 --> 03:16.548
Get the girl and the horse out of here!

03:20.048 --> 03:21.220
Hey!

03:23.267 --> 03:25.089
Let's go!

♪

04:59.376 --> 05:00.705
Mr. Martin.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.424
Ray Henson.

05:02.699 --> 05:05.799
- Talk about good timing.
- My associate, Jules Faroux.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.331
- Ma'am.
- How are you?

05:07.720 --> 05:08.909
How's the injured guard doing?

05:08.928 --> 05:10.919
He's got a concussion, but
the doctor said he'll be okay.

05:11.891 --> 05:14.057
- How are you doing?
- Fine, thank you.

05:14.177 --> 05:16.161
I got round-the-clock security,

05:16.170 --> 05:18.557
and still this bastard
manages to sneak in here.

05:18.562 --> 05:21.129
I'd be dead by now if you
hadn't shown up. So would Daksha.

05:21.131 --> 05:22.911
It was a pretty bold attack.

05:23.167 --> 05:25.700
Yeah, well, they've already
tried poisoning his feed,

05:25.702 --> 05:28.203
leaving nails on the track,
but now they're desperate.

05:28.205 --> 05:30.805
Only 24 hours. Belmont.

05:30.807 --> 05:32.107
Who's "they"?

05:32.109 --> 05:35.143
I got my ideas, but I can't be certain.

05:35.145 --> 05:37.766
- And your best guess?
- Howard Vorchek.

05:38.047 --> 05:40.147
He's a casino operator.

05:40.149 --> 05:41.916
Pretty shady character.

05:42.146 --> 05:43.948
What makes you think it's him?

05:44.277 --> 05:46.509
If Daksha weren't in the race,

05:46.692 --> 05:49.820
his horse, Snow Clash,
would be favoured to win.

05:49.940 --> 05:51.594
Whoever it was, someone's been sending

05:51.631 --> 05:53.707
these threatening text
messages to my phone all week.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.698
Uh, I'd like to take a
look at those messages.

05:56.744 --> 05:58.693
I mean, we might be able to track them.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.412
Chances are they're from a
throwaway, but you never know.

06:00.532 --> 06:02.334
Um, my phone's in the kit room.

06:02.338 --> 06:03.453
Great.

06:04.427 --> 06:06.000
Look, all that really matters

06:06.028 --> 06:08.736
is that you get that
animal safely to the track,

06:08.736 --> 06:10.365
first thing tomorrow morning, Mr. Martin.

06:10.426 --> 06:11.573
I'll do my best,

06:11.639 --> 06:13.243
but I'd advise you to call the police.

06:13.281 --> 06:15.882
That's exactly what Vorchek wants us to do.

06:15.884 --> 06:18.317
Create controversy, distraction.

06:18.319 --> 06:20.723
I'd say he's done enough
of that already, Ms. Henson.

06:20.843 --> 06:23.217
It's only another 24 hours.

06:23.892 --> 06:26.292
We just need to keep our eyes on the prize.

06:26.624 --> 06:28.848
Plenty of time for the police after.

06:31.465 --> 06:33.438
So, you're, uh, a jockey?

06:33.768 --> 06:34.679
Yeah.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.488
That's cool. I didn't know
there were many female jockeys.

06:36.523 --> 06:38.004
Yeah, there aren't.

06:38.561 --> 06:41.377
And I would be the first
to win the Triple Crown.

06:41.886 --> 06:44.169
Wow, that's... that's amazing.

06:44.216 --> 06:45.491
You could say that.

06:47.078 --> 06:49.202
Do you actually know
what the Triple Crown is?

06:49.616 --> 06:50.355
No.

06:50.426 --> 06:52.896
Heh-heh, okay. It's when the same horse

06:52.919 --> 06:54.517
wins the biggest three races of the year,

06:54.555 --> 06:57.421
so it's Kentucky Derby, Preakness,

06:57.444 --> 06:58.872
and Belmont Stakes.

06:59.153 --> 07:00.728
That must be pretty hard to do.

07:00.962 --> 07:04.211
Yeah, no one's done it in nearly 40 years.

07:06.032 --> 07:07.846
But Daksha and I have got a shot.

07:09.034 --> 07:11.551
Yeah, well, if anyone can get
you there tomorrow, it's Frank.

07:11.738 --> 07:13.366
He's that good, huh?

07:13.419 --> 07:16.040
Yeah, and he's competitive, like yourself.

07:16.042 --> 07:17.569
He doesn't like to lose.

07:18.111 --> 07:19.759
(Computer beeping)

07:21.076 --> 07:24.523
Ah. Yeah, it was a throwaway,
just like I thought.

07:31.256 --> 07:33.432
Okay, whoa. That's good.

07:43.835 --> 07:45.515
Course there's a horse trailer,

07:45.524 --> 07:47.930
- but what's with the cargo truck?
- It's a blind.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.473
We'll be less vulnerable in two vehicles.

07:50.475 --> 07:51.908
That makes sense.

07:52.686 --> 07:54.497
How is he on a long journey?

07:54.872 --> 07:58.668
Well, he doesn't much like them,
but 12 hours should be okay.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.117
It's gonna be longer than that.

08:00.119 --> 08:01.818
What on Earth for?

08:01.820 --> 08:04.485
Interstate's the shortest
route, but it's not the safest.

08:04.522 --> 08:06.031
Mr. Martin, he's got a race to run.

08:06.049 --> 08:08.308
12 hours is about all he can take.

08:09.753 --> 08:11.763
Can you stay with the horse
while it's being loaded?

08:11.763 --> 08:12.844
Yeah, sure.

08:12.853 --> 08:15.265
- I need a word in private.
- Okay.

08:30.479 --> 08:33.205
This isn't like transporting
a person or a package.

08:33.205 --> 08:34.421
Yes, I get that.

08:34.467 --> 08:36.589
Usually on a job I can take evasive action,

08:36.607 --> 08:37.705
but on this one, I can't,

08:37.732 --> 08:39.655
not without risking injury to the horse.

08:39.657 --> 08:42.991
I was promised you would get him
to the track, rested and ready.

08:42.993 --> 08:45.427
I'll get him there, if
you let me do it my way.

08:45.429 --> 08:47.162
And what exactly is your way?

08:47.164 --> 08:49.398
By not telling you or anyone
else how I'm gonna do it.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.900
Well, is there anything you can tell us?

08:51.902 --> 08:54.670
That I'll get him there safe and sound.

08:54.672 --> 08:56.070

You have any idea how much
that horse is worth, Mr. Martin?

08:59.676 --> 09:01.176
I'm told 10 million.

09:01.178 --> 09:04.512
Three times that in stud
fees if he wins tomorrow.

claim would be a sure thing.

16:05.622 --> 16:07.245
What are you insinuating.

16:07.272 --> 16:08.744
If I was interested in the insurance money

16:08.745 --> 16:11.361
why would I hire a
transporter to protect him?

16:11.626 --> 16:13.695
Well, to make it look like you're innocent.

16:14.488 --> 16:17.832
If you're counting on
my failure to deliver.

16:18.156 --> 16:21.092
I'm afraid I'm not that clever, Mr. Martin.

16:21.366 --> 16:25.139
Besides, as Alice will tell
you, I don't like to lose.

16:25.141 --> 16:26.607
Ever.

16:26.609 --> 16:29.009
Now, would you please go and get my horse?

16:29.011 --> 16:31.345
We have a race to win.

16:31.347 --> 16:33.280
Will do, ma'am.

16:42.484 --> 16:44.826
Yeah! Go, go, go, go!

16:44.860 --> 16:46.960
Oh, you son-of-a-bitch!

16:46.962 --> 16:48.362
Man, he's fast!

16:48.364 --> 16:49.963
34, Mr. Vorchek.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.466
He's a goddamn lightning bolt.

16:51.467 --> 16:53.099
He's gonna make you proud tomorrow.

16:53.101 --> 16:55.005
He bloody well better, man.

16:55.125 --> 16:59.239
(Phone ringing)

16:59.259 --> 17:01.893
Ah, the grand old lady of
Kentucky herself. Hello, Ray.

17:02.013 --> 17:03.977
This has gone far enough, Howard.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.146
Now I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:06.147 --> 17:08.281
I'm sure you do.

17:08.282 --> 17:09.714
We need to talk.

17:09.717 --> 17:10.883
<i>I'm listening.</i>

17:10.885 --> 17:12.685
No, face to face.

17:12.686 --> 17:15.119
<i>Yeah, when? Where?</i>

17:15.122 --> 17:17.189
One hour, Lane Field Road.

17:17.191 --> 17:19.124
<i>Sure, I'll be there.</i>

17:21.161 --> 17:23.729
Is everything all right, Mr. Vorchek?

17:23.731 --> 17:24.530
(Chuckling)

17:24.558 --> 17:25.782
Actually, Jeff,

17:25.903 --> 17:28.372
I think things are about
to get a whole lot better.

17:43.616 --> 17:45.209
Everything okay?

17:47.920 --> 17:50.167
- Fine.
- How's Daksha?

18:00.565 --> 18:01.699
He's doing all right.

18:01.701 --> 18:03.167
How's he been?

18:03.574 --> 18:06.537
I don't know, he didn't say anything.

18:06.539 --> 18:08.915
Oh, I did see him twitch, though.

18:09.035 --> 18:10.159
A twitch?

18:10.196 --> 18:11.293
Yeah, when I looked back,

18:11.312 --> 18:13.377
his hind legs were sort
of twitching, weirdly.

18:13.379 --> 18:16.342
Yeah, well, I mean, he's been
cooped up here for hours, right?

18:17.229 --> 18:20.230
Is it all right if I take him
for a little break, Mr. Martin?

18:20.431 --> 18:23.202
Sure. Just a short one.

18:25.745 --> 18:28.169
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

18:28.794 --> 18:31.061
I was just about to give him
a carrot. Do you wanna try?

18:31.063 --> 18:34.206
- Uh, yeah, sure. How do I...
- Oh, just...

18:34.326 --> 18:36.301
You gotta hold your hand
out flat, like a tray.

18:36.319 --> 18:37.234
Okay.

18:37.236 --> 18:39.721
And then he doesn't get your fingers.

18:40.172 --> 18:41.738
Wow!

18:41.740 --> 18:43.506
Yeah. Heh-heh...

18:43.508 --> 18:45.976
Yeah, I wouldn't want
that. I'd be out of a job.

18:45.978 --> 18:48.529
Oh, yeah, computer guy. Of course.

18:49.047 --> 18:51.981
Yeah. Computers, cars, anything mechanical.

18:51.983 --> 18:53.983
Animals, not so much.

18:54.457 --> 18:56.752
Animals are my whole world.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.389
I'd do just about anything for this horse.

18:59.391 --> 19:02.057
Yeah, I can see that. I
mean, he seems pretty special.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.630
World class racer, right?

19:03.877 --> 19:06.295
Yeah, well, it's more than that, you know?

19:06.297 --> 19:08.340
You spend so much time together,

19:08.900 --> 19:11.500
you build up a relationship
with a horse like this.

19:11.502 --> 19:13.402
He's pretty much my best friend.

19:18.909 --> 19:20.309
What's wrong?

19:20.889 --> 19:24.283
Oh... I was just thinking of
something Ray told me one time.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.049
To be a winner, you have
to put yourself first.

19:28.051 --> 19:30.419
You have to be a little ruthless.

19:31.987 --> 19:34.828
It's tough to be selfish
like that, you know?

19:35.893 --> 19:38.560
But Belmont's a big race.
It's really important.

19:38.562 --> 19:40.627
It's really competitive.

19:41.377 --> 19:43.306
You gotta be on your game.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.166
Yeah.

19:45.757 --> 19:48.904
FRANK: Jules, Alice, time to go.

19:50.468 --> 19:52.645
- Should get going.
- Yeah.

20:07.055 --> 20:15.400
♪

20:18.323 --> 20:20.300
You better wake her up.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.017
What? Why?

20:22.137 --> 20:24.378
Pull over for gas.

20:37.957 --> 20:39.953
Hoo! You look good, Ray.

20:39.955 --> 20:41.888
Cut the crap, Howard.

20:41.890 --> 20:43.456
You know, I don't know why you insist

20:43.458 --> 20:45.950
on treating me like the
enemy, 'cause I'm not.

20:46.179 --> 20:47.972
I know what you're doing.

20:48.283 --> 20:51.297
You call off your dogs,
and I won't call the cops.

20:51.594 --> 20:53.966
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

20:53.968 --> 20:57.503
Tommy Sans has been trying to kill Daksha.

20:57.505 --> 20:58.984
You've been paying him to do it.

20:58.993 --> 21:01.374
I did hear about the attacks on your horse,

21:01.376 --> 21:04.774
and I'm real sorry, Ray.
Daksha's a hell of a fine horse.

21:04.778 --> 21:07.679
You and I both know Snow
Clash is second favourite.

21:07.681 --> 21:09.502
You want him to be first.

21:09.622 --> 21:12.050
That only happens if Daksha doesn't run.

21:12.052 --> 21:14.212
Honey, I got no problem
with Daksha running,

21:14.222 --> 21:16.856
'cause if he does, I make even more money.

21:17.368 --> 21:20.874
I just want to minimize our mutual risk.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.228
Our mutual risk?

21:23.579 --> 21:24.987
Okay, what I'm about to say to you

21:25.005 --> 21:26.926
is a conversation that never happened.

21:27.046 --> 21:28.333
I'm listening.

21:28.335 --> 21:30.201
Let Snow Clash win tomorrow

21:30.203 --> 21:31.948
and you'll have more money
than you'll ever need.

21:31.948 --> 21:33.878
How do you figure that?

21:34.637 --> 21:38.175
I own a string of casinos,
several internet gambling sites,

21:38.506 --> 21:40.554
bets could be made under false names,

21:40.572 --> 21:43.115
all for Snow Clash, the
second favourite, to win.

21:43.235 --> 21:46.764
If we double down, we stand
to make... who knows how much.

21:46.884 --> 21:50.354
It's not gonna do us much
good if we're both in prison.

21:50.356 --> 21:52.256
It's a risk, I'll grant you,

21:52.553 --> 21:55.725
but really, you can't
afford not to take it, Ray.

21:56.331 --> 21:59.577
I know the bank's about
to foreclose on your farm.

22:00.366 --> 22:02.687
Even if Daksha run tomorrow,

22:03.102 --> 22:06.355
you'd have to sell him,
just to pay off the bank.

22:06.355 --> 22:08.614
That is one thing I will never do.

22:08.651 --> 22:11.202
Oh, hell, I know you love your horse, Ray,

22:11.733 --> 22:13.452
but I also know you're desperate.

22:13.572 --> 22:18.728
- Desperate enough to hire Sans yourself?
- I didn't hire Sans and you know it.

22:18.948 --> 22:22.953
Now you are the one who is
up to your eyeballs in debt.

22:23.503 --> 22:26.018
And all your casinos and gaming sites,

22:26.138 --> 22:28.991
they don't bring in half as
much as you need to pay 'em off.

22:28.993 --> 22:31.982
I think you're the one
who really needs the money.

22:33.997 --> 22:36.317
I'll tell you something.

22:36.582 --> 22:39.043
Snow Clash is fast as hell.

22:39.088 --> 22:41.879
He may win tomorrow
whether Daksha runs or not.

22:41.999 --> 22:45.207
What makes you think I would
ever cut a deal with you?

22:47.077 --> 22:48.903
Well, you're here, aren't you?

22:49.772 --> 22:52.280
You didn't go to the police
with your crazy theories.

22:52.282 --> 22:54.049
You came to me.

22:54.245 --> 22:58.186
And you know what? I think
we'd make a pretty good team.

23:00.336 --> 23:02.449
Think about it, Ray.

23:04.428 --> 23:06.361
I'll be here if you wanna talk.

23:14.603 --> 23:16.470
What are you doing?

23:16.472 --> 23:17.549
What?

23:17.559 --> 23:19.882
You've never tried hot
sauce and maple syrup on...

23:20.002 --> 23:22.884
- No.
- Oh, it's fantastic. You gotta try it.

23:24.366 --> 23:26.313
No I... I... I can't.
I gotta watch my weight.

23:26.315 --> 23:27.849
I'm not allowed to eat.

23:27.851 --> 23:29.784
Come on, it's like a Canadian tradition.

23:29.786 --> 23:31.785
Seriously, try it. It's
really, really good.

23:34.097 --> 23:35.616
Okay...

23:38.377 --> 23:39.237
Right?

23:39.274 --> 23:40.325
That's disgusting.

23:40.329 --> 23:42.136
- Yeah?
- Yeah, that's gross.

23:42.256 --> 23:44.064
- Sorry.
- (Laughing)

23:50.716 --> 23:52.372
What? Do I have something on my face?

23:52.374 --> 23:53.826
No.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.938
So, how did you get into computers?

24:02.469 --> 24:06.986
Oh, well, um... I always
liked knowing how things work.

24:08.634 --> 24:10.820
I mean, it's not that crazy. It's just...

24:10.940 --> 24:12.722
like learning a new language, you know?

24:12.749 --> 24:15.648
No, it is. I mean, nobody...
I don't understand computers.

24:15.657 --> 24:17.194
I don't know anyone who
understands computers.

24:17.221 --> 24:19.453
- Y'all want more coffee?
- Oh, yeah, please.

24:22.709 --> 24:24.447
- Thanks.
- All right, y'all enjoy.

24:24.749 --> 24:27.438
So, how'd you get into horseracing?

24:30.694 --> 24:33.345
I just... loved horses, you know?

24:33.347 --> 24:34.947
I mean, every kid loves horses,

24:34.982 --> 24:37.590
but I just wanted to be
around them all the time.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.704
I didn't care about playing
with my friends. I just

24:39.824 --> 24:42.283
wanted to be around horses, so...

24:42.403 --> 24:45.219
Um, so I... I got into
riding, really young, and then

24:45.339 --> 24:47.707
Ray took me on, real young.

24:47.726 --> 24:49.294
I started working at the stable,

24:49.296 --> 24:52.564
training all the time, basically.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.202
Yeah.

24:54.434 --> 24:57.635
That's sort of like... like me with cars.

24:57.637 --> 25:00.367
I... I always loved them. As
soon as I looked under a hood

25:00.385 --> 25:01.620
and I saw that engine for the first time,

25:01.620 --> 25:02.874
it's like... it's weird.

25:02.892 --> 25:05.453
I knew exactly where everything went,

25:05.471 --> 25:07.812
and what its function was,
you know? It just made sense.

25:07.814 --> 25:09.847
I feel that way about horses, like I...

25:09.849 --> 25:12.248
A lot of people think
they're so unpredictable,

25:12.285 --> 25:14.041
but I've never found it that way.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.019
More than that, I mean,

25:16.346 --> 25:19.319
I just really like making
machines work better, you know?

25:19.359 --> 25:21.359
Faster. It's like a real buzz.

25:21.361 --> 25:23.761
Same as horseracing.

25:23.763 --> 25:25.696
Yeah.

25:38.243 --> 25:39.576
We have to go.

25:39.578 --> 25:41.160
I'll tell her.

25:43.881 --> 25:46.249
Alice?

25:48.962 --> 25:51.368
Hey, we're heading out.
Everything all right?

25:51.390 --> 25:52.868
Yep.

25:53.124 --> 25:54.824
Yep, it's all good.

25:55.071 --> 25:56.760
Cool.

26:00.497 --> 26:02.431
Shh...

26:16.301 --> 26:19.484
(Indistinct sports commentary)

26:37.273 --> 26:40.101
(Moaning)

26:40.103 --> 26:41.602
What?

26:41.604 --> 26:43.684
(Muffled speech)

26:43.804 --> 26:47.635
I can't... I can't breathe!

26:52.940 --> 26:56.671
Oh, thanks, pal. I can't breathe, man.

26:56.937 --> 26:58.007
I'm suffocating.

26:58.016 --> 27:01.025
Okay, you don't speak, got it?

27:10.198 --> 27:11.966
Hey, pal, I could make you some easy money.

27:11.968 --> 27:13.762
What'd I just tell you?

27:15.037 --> 27:17.037
I'm gonna put that gag back in your mouth.

27:17.039 --> 27:20.109
No, seriously, I know who's
gonna win the next race.

27:21.445 --> 27:22.899
How do you know that?

27:23.439 --> 27:25.122
Acid Chevrons.

27:25.350 --> 27:26.924
I fixed it.

27:27.143 --> 27:29.115
I got a bookie you can call.

27:29.117 --> 27:31.488
That tip will pay you 40 to 1.

27:35.857 --> 27:37.725
Come on, pal, it's easy money.

27:37.734 --> 27:39.558
I said no thanks.

27:40.432 --> 27:42.170
Suit yourself.

28:00.414 --> 28:01.629
Oh, sorry.

28:01.647 --> 28:03.998
Oh, not, it's really... it's no problem.

28:04.546 --> 28:06.018
Where are we?

28:06.020 --> 28:08.790
Uh, just at a gas station.
Frank's filling up.

28:08.910 --> 28:11.085
Okay. Uh, I'm just gonna go get some...

28:11.104 --> 28:13.061
Yeah, yeah, sure.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.260
Oh, you...

28:37.080 --> 28:39.150
Oh, I'm not feeling good.

28:39.152 --> 28:42.285
Will you shut the fuck up, please?

28:42.405 --> 28:45.743
No, seriously, I got type-1 diabetes.

28:45.863 --> 28:47.391
You're full of shit.

28:47.393 --> 28:50.444
I should've had my insulin.
I haven't had it today.

28:51.085 --> 28:53.024
I'm not joking.

28:53.833 --> 28:56.567
Should've had it hours ago.

28:56.569 --> 29:00.737
You don't want me going into
a state of shock, do you?

29:07.144 --> 29:09.276
Where is it?

29:11.133 --> 29:12.248
What?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.484
You're needle. Where is it?

29:15.313 --> 29:17.902
Uh, it's in my pocket.

29:19.072 --> 29:20.390
Left pocket.

29:26.618 --> 29:28.531
Ah, thanks. I appreciate it, brother.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.933
I'm not your brother. Shut the fuck up.

29:34.544 --> 29:36.373
There ain't nothing in here.

29:45.141 --> 29:47.775
Argh!

29:51.114 --> 29:53.254
I told you.

30:03.533 --> 30:05.510
We're all set. Where's Alice?

30:07.440 --> 30:09.571
What's the matter?

30:10.477 --> 30:12.773
I found this in her bag.

30:24.953 --> 30:26.354
(Car chirping)

30:42.336 --> 30:44.942
What's the matter?

30:46.083 --> 30:48.388
- Where'd you get that from?
- Found it in your bag.

30:48.406 --> 30:51.205
- You were going through my things?
- No, it fell out.

30:51.325 --> 30:54.681
So what is this? Performance
enhancing drugs? Steroids? What?

30:54.683 --> 30:56.309
No, of course not.

30:56.429 --> 30:57.589
Well?

30:58.053 --> 31:00.920
Remember how we told you that
they were trying to kill Daksha?

31:00.922 --> 31:03.506
They put the nails on the track
and they poisoned his feed?

31:03.552 --> 31:05.445
- Yeah.
- Well, they nearly succeeded.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.046
It got into the feed, he colicked.

31:07.092 --> 31:10.247
We've been treating him with
banamine but he's still at risk.

31:10.549 --> 31:12.131
What kind of a risk.

31:12.597 --> 31:14.107
His heart.

31:14.903 --> 31:17.143
Would that explain the
twitching that I saw?

31:18.451 --> 31:20.243
So that's medicine?

31:20.363 --> 31:21.890
Yes.

31:26.179 --> 31:28.722
Wouldn't this show up in
a drug test or screening?

31:28.924 --> 31:31.722
No, it's legal. He can
race with it in his system.

31:31.741 --> 31:33.413
Why didn't you just tell us?

31:34.173 --> 31:35.984
Because Ray didn't want anyone to know.

31:36.012 --> 31:37.255
Why not?

31:37.585 --> 31:39.176
Because...

31:39.862 --> 31:41.975
he's not 100%.

31:42.795 --> 31:44.730
The vet says he's clear, but...

31:45.107 --> 31:48.634
I know this horse. He's not himself.

31:50.369 --> 31:53.741
But he's well enough to race.

31:54.884 --> 31:58.406
Daksha could be the first
horse in nearly 40 years

31:58.433 --> 32:00.034
to win the Triple Crown, or...

32:00.299 --> 32:03.400
Either that or the race could kill him.

32:04.917 --> 32:06.830
And you're willing to take that chance?

32:08.174 --> 32:10.168
It's Ray's decision.

32:12.158 --> 32:14.740
(Phone ringing)

32:18.161 --> 32:19.945
Mr. Martin, it's Ray Henson.

32:20.065 --> 32:22.966
My guard's in hospital. Sans escaped.

32:22.968 --> 32:24.201
When?

32:24.203 --> 32:25.598
<i>It's kind of hard to say.</i>

32:25.604 --> 32:27.671
My guy's still unconscious.

32:27.673 --> 32:28.918
Okay.

32:29.987 --> 32:31.441
<i>- Mr. Martin.
- Yep.</i>

32:31.443 --> 32:34.144
Howard Vorchek is definitely behind this.

32:34.146 --> 32:35.923
You said you suspected as much.

32:35.932 --> 32:37.277
<i>But now I'm sure.</i>

32:37.397 --> 32:40.183
He made me a rather interesting offer,

32:40.185 --> 32:42.875
fixing the odds on the computerized bets,

32:42.902 --> 32:45.021
if I let Snow Clash win tomorrow.

32:45.023 --> 32:46.505
What'd you say?

32:46.541 --> 32:48.654
<i>I refused, naturally.</i>

32:49.166 --> 32:51.260
Okay. Thanks for the heads up.

32:59.703 --> 33:02.004
(Phone ringing)

33:05.198 --> 33:06.487
Where the hell are you?

33:06.607 --> 33:09.044
I got a little tied up,
but I'm on the road now.

33:09.046 --> 33:10.879
On the road where?

33:10.881 --> 33:12.734
Outside Philly.

33:12.854 --> 33:15.083
You mean you haven't even
stopped this transporter yet?

33:15.084 --> 33:16.828
I got guys checking the interstate,

33:16.845 --> 33:18.438
but he must be sticking to back roads.

33:18.655 --> 33:20.065
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

33:20.281 --> 33:22.260
It's less than 12 hours until the race.

33:22.723 --> 33:23.859
I'll stop 'em.

33:23.861 --> 33:25.403
Well, I hope you do.

33:25.763 --> 33:27.362
And before he gets to New York City,

33:27.364 --> 33:29.063
or I'm gonna be out 20 million.

33:29.065 --> 33:30.932
Don't you worry, Mr. Vorchek.

33:30.934 --> 33:32.831
He can't stay on back roads forever.

33:32.855 --> 33:34.035
What's that supposed to mean?

33:34.037 --> 33:35.805
<i>It means if we want to stop this guy,</i>

33:35.834 --> 33:37.839
I'm gonna need more resources.

33:47.549 --> 33:49.601
How much longer do you
think until we get there?

33:49.953 --> 33:53.250
Should be in the city in about an hour.

33:53.857 --> 33:57.256
We'll be on time then. Early, even.

33:57.894 --> 34:00.439
Will you be all right to race?
You haven't got much sleep.

34:00.677 --> 34:02.406
I'll be okay.

34:02.732 --> 34:05.049
How about him?

34:05.643 --> 34:07.401
I don't know.

34:07.403 --> 34:10.844
Sometimes I really think I'm
doing the wrong thing, racing him.

34:11.677 --> 34:15.262
I keep asking myself, you
know, am I doing it for Ray?

34:15.545 --> 34:17.594
She's put everything into it.

34:17.905 --> 34:19.826
Am I doing it for me?

34:20.514 --> 34:23.556
Or am I doing it for...
for Daksha? I mean, he's...

34:23.757 --> 34:25.952
he's born to run this race.

34:26.237 --> 34:28.157
I guess that's what you meant earlier

34:28.157 --> 34:31.139
when you talked about how hard
it is, being selfish, sometimes.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.167
We've got a problem.

34:40.768 --> 34:43.723
- What? It's just construction.
- It's a setup.

34:44.638 --> 34:45.672
Sans?

34:45.674 --> 34:47.572
Shit. How did he know we'd be here?

34:48.214 --> 34:51.811
We couldn't take these back
roads forever. We knew that.

34:51.813 --> 34:53.645
Well, let's just blow past 'em.

34:53.647 --> 34:56.684
I can't. Not without
risking injury to the horse.

34:57.032 --> 34:59.384
So you're just stopping?

35:00.224 --> 35:02.163
Uh-huh...

35:07.760 --> 35:10.295
Well, hello, Mr. Fancy Pants.

35:10.415 --> 35:13.930
Let's step outside, with
your hands in the air.

35:20.673 --> 35:22.661
(Gunshots)

35:45.630 --> 35:47.423
Frank!

35:49.033 --> 35:51.036
Alice, come on!

35:52.404 --> 35:53.866
Get the horse!

35:54.076 --> 35:55.878
You come with me!

36:04.913 --> 36:06.843
Hands in the air.

36:08.507 --> 36:10.921
Do it now or I'll blow her brains out.

36:10.923 --> 36:13.255
Well, if you put it that way.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.697
I should just kill you now,

36:15.716 --> 36:17.408
after the ass-whupping you gave me.

36:17.696 --> 36:19.109
Your call.

36:19.145 --> 36:20.591
All in good time.

36:20.984 --> 36:24.780
Now I need you it bring me the
horse, and no tricks this time.

36:25.437 --> 36:27.737
If you please.

36:27.739 --> 36:31.107
Mind if I just get the
keys out of my pocket?

36:31.347 --> 36:33.835
Careful.

36:34.155 --> 36:36.515
Woo!

36:38.262 --> 36:40.365
Let's go.

36:40.485 --> 36:42.184
Come on!

36:42.186 --> 36:43.819
(Gunshots)

37:08.552 --> 37:12.380
Hold up! Okay! Whoa...

37:31.527 --> 37:33.804
Whoa, whoa...

37:35.185 --> 37:39.281
- I can't believe you just did that.
- Yeah, neither can I.

37:39.870 --> 37:42.120
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

37:42.147 --> 37:44.507
That's amazing. Thank you so much.

37:44.535 --> 37:46.666
- Yeah.
- You saved him.

37:47.928 --> 37:50.315
You're okay, right?

37:51.193 --> 37:53.260
It's just he's got a bit of a...

37:53.754 --> 37:56.900
- bit of discharge.
- Is that... is that bad?

37:57.826 --> 37:59.909
I don't know...

38:00.496 --> 38:01.995
You okay, boy?

38:01.997 --> 38:04.130
Let's get him back to the truck.

38:04.132 --> 38:05.625
Okay...

38:05.745 --> 38:07.634
Jump on.

38:09.803 --> 38:11.433
RAY: Alice, where are you?

38:11.442 --> 38:12.820
<i>ALICE: We're just outside New York.</i>

38:12.851 --> 38:15.311
Oh, good, you're close.
Everything all right?

38:15.431 --> 38:16.809
Not exactly.

38:16.811 --> 38:19.045
<i>- Well, what is it?
- It's Daksha.</i>

38:19.410 --> 38:21.747
What happened? Is he hurt?

38:21.749 --> 38:23.105
<i>No, no, nothing like that.</i>

38:23.133 --> 38:25.051
We got him away from Sans and his men,

38:25.053 --> 38:27.586
but he's just not well, Ray. I know it.

38:27.588 --> 38:29.481
Well, sure he is.

38:29.764 --> 38:31.383
You gave him his medicine, didn't you?

38:31.503 --> 38:33.212
Yes, I did, but he's not well.

38:33.258 --> 38:36.028
Alice, you cannot lose your nerve now,

38:36.030 --> 38:38.152
not after all we've been through.

38:38.170 --> 38:40.027
I'm not losing my nerve, Ray, okay?

38:40.041 --> 38:41.636
I'm just telling you you have a choice.

38:41.756 --> 38:43.876
We can forfeit this race,
or you can kill this animal.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.037
Either way, you lose.

38:45.039 --> 38:47.359
I don't like those choices.

38:48.010 --> 38:49.913
What does Mr. Martin say?

38:50.476 --> 38:52.386
She wants to know what you have to say?

39:01.021 --> 39:03.220
Ah, he's looking good, Jeff.

39:03.516 --> 39:06.924
Oh, you beastie! Looking good!

39:06.926 --> 39:08.712
Good work, Jeff.

39:08.997 --> 39:11.562
A beautiful horse, Howard.
You don't deserve him.

39:12.911 --> 39:14.565
You lookin' to change your mind, Ray?

39:14.567 --> 39:16.533
Not exactly.

39:16.535 --> 39:18.714
Sans must've told you by now.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.733
Daksha eluded his clutches.

39:20.853 --> 39:22.205
Well, I don't see him here.

39:22.497 --> 39:24.048
He's on his way now.

39:24.158 --> 39:27.275
But I thought you might be
interested in hearing my plan first.

39:27.479 --> 39:28.878
What sort of plan is that?

39:28.880 --> 39:31.622
Well, I believe that
Daksha's gonna win Belmont,

39:31.644 --> 39:34.414
and so do you, and I'm
not gonna sacrifice that,

39:34.417 --> 39:36.144
not for all the money in the world.

39:36.202 --> 39:37.887
Well, then we got nothing to talk about.

39:37.889 --> 39:39.656
Maybe. Maybe not.

39:39.924 --> 39:42.959
But maybe his victory could also be yours.

39:42.961 --> 39:44.827
What are you talking about?

39:45.187 --> 39:48.290
Place your big bet on Daksha to win.

39:48.831 --> 39:51.133
You want me to bet against my own horse?

39:51.135 --> 39:53.368
You expected me to bet against mine.

39:53.370 --> 39:56.705
The odds aren't as good,
but they're still good.

39:56.967 --> 39:59.119
We could both make a lot of money.

39:59.776 --> 40:01.307
Think about it.

40:01.768 --> 40:03.502
Not much time left.

40:12.589 --> 40:13.655
Well?

40:13.657 --> 40:15.857
We have a deal, thanks to you.

40:15.859 --> 40:17.147
Amazing.

40:17.345 --> 40:18.647
So what do we do now?

40:18.767 --> 40:20.228
Celebrate your defeat.

40:20.230 --> 40:21.362
Hm.

40:25.801 --> 40:27.535
Excuse me.

40:27.537 --> 40:28.869
Where you going?

40:28.871 --> 40:31.817
I have some business to
attend to. I'll be back.

40:35.044 --> 40:37.512
(Playing harmonica)

40:45.687 --> 40:47.121
Well, well...

40:47.123 --> 40:50.776
I hear your boss and mine
have come to an understanding.

40:51.260 --> 40:53.803
I guess this concludes our business.

40:53.923 --> 40:56.812
It does. This is just for fun.

41:15.316 --> 41:16.896
Sit down.

41:48.215 --> 41:51.115
<i>COMMENTATOR: That's right, Sally,
the horses and jockeys are lining up,</i>

41:51.142 --> 41:53.284
<i>getting ready to take
their positions at the gate.</i>

41:53.286 --> 41:55.128
<i>Also getting ready for the starting bell</i>

41:55.155 --> 41:56.987
<i>on this legendary 1 ½-mile track</i>

41:56.990 --> 41:59.131
<i>known as the "test of the champion."</i>

41:59.159 --> 42:00.574
<i>SALLY: That's right, Bob.</i>

42:00.601 --> 42:03.520
<i>The crowd is still reeling
from the news just seconds ago</i>

42:03.520 --> 42:05.884
<i>that Daksha, the n°1 favourite</i>

42:05.913 --> 42:07.479
<i>and potential Triple Crown winner,</i>

42:07.494 --> 42:09.506
<i>has withdrawn due to health concerns.</i>

42:09.536 --> 42:11.068
<i>BOB: Any details on that?</i>

42:11.070 --> 42:12.169
(Phone ringing)

42:12.171 --> 42:13.347
<i>SALLY: Not much, but all we know is...</i>

42:13.545 --> 42:16.022
This is the call I've been
waiting for. Excuse me.

42:16.062 --> 42:18.008
<i>BOB: Well, we'll keep you
posted as the details come in.</i>

42:18.059 --> 42:19.043
Hello, Howard.

42:19.045 --> 42:20.767
You know what you've done?

42:21.214 --> 42:23.347
Do you know what you've done?!

42:23.349 --> 42:25.011
I'm ruined!

42:25.201 --> 42:26.825
And so are you!

42:26.847 --> 42:28.582
Come on, lesser people than us

42:28.589 --> 42:31.120
have lost and remade
fortunes before, Howard.

42:32.196 --> 42:34.478
<i>- Ray, you're a fool.
- Yeah, well, maybe so.</i>

42:34.598 --> 42:38.729
But cheer up. Your horse is
about to win the Belmont Stakes.

42:38.849 --> 42:40.597
Ah, shut your head.

42:49.807 --> 42:52.056
So, thank you.

42:52.745 --> 42:54.144
For everything.

42:54.146 --> 42:56.529
You're welcome. Good luck.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.833
So how's he doing?

43:05.123 --> 43:07.023
He's faster than ever.

43:09.736 --> 43:11.961
Do you regret it?

43:11.963 --> 43:14.282
I mean, you could've won the Triple Crown.

43:14.932 --> 43:16.550
Well...

43:16.944 --> 43:19.999
This is just a trophy, right?

43:21.272 --> 43:22.981
Well...

43:23.308 --> 43:25.176
you really surprised me there.

43:25.610 --> 43:28.844
All that talk about competing
and winning, you gave it up.

43:30.471 --> 43:31.752
Well...

43:33.083 --> 43:35.941
I guess there's different
kinds of winning, right?

43:36.508 --> 43:38.585
Yeah.

43:40.688 --> 43:42.858
You were great at riding, by the way.

43:42.860 --> 43:45.535
- Come on.
- No, seriously, you had good form.

43:45.572 --> 43:47.784
Really? I could barely stay on the thing.

43:49.065 --> 43:51.077
I feel like I could teach you to ride.

43:51.368 --> 43:54.763
Yeah. I think I'd really like that.

43:56.830 --> 43:59.207
Next time I'm in Kentucky, then.

43:59.209 --> 44:01.952
Yeah. Next time.

44:03.478 --> 44:05.446
