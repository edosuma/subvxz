00:07.584 --> 00:09.913
Hey. Did you eat my fries?

00:09.952 --> 00:11.336
You shouldn't have left them.

00:16.944 --> 00:18.101
What is that?

00:22.991 --> 00:25.120
I have no idea.

00:28.239 --> 00:29.328
Call 9-1-1!

00:57.518 --> 00:58.673
Almost there, Castle.

00:58.716 --> 01:00.734
Just another two weeks.

01:00.775 --> 01:01.990
It's already been two weeks.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.211
Two weeks is an eternity.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.980
Yeah, well, maybe next
time we go skiing,

01:05.019 --> 01:06.601
you're not gonna be
such a show-off.

01:06.641 --> 01:08.333
I wasn't showing off.

01:09.201 --> 01:11.269
Okay, I was showing
off a little bit.

01:11.314 --> 01:12.254
But I swear to you,

01:12.304 --> 01:14.540
I can do a tail grab
with my eyes closed

01:14.584 --> 01:16.076
and without breaking my kneecap.

01:16.178 --> 01:17.052
Mm-hmm.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.513
Well, I am off.

01:19.551 --> 01:21.102
Now the retreat is out
of cell phone range,

01:21.137 --> 01:22.555
so if I don't call you
on your birthday,

01:22.598 --> 01:24.684
it is not because
I have forgotten.

01:24.722 --> 01:26.561
I won't think it's because
you've forgotten.

01:26.609 --> 01:28.494
I'll think it's because
you made other plans.

01:28.542 --> 01:29.533
Now wait a minute.

01:29.570 --> 01:31.384
You and Katherine were
supposed to be celebrating

01:31.429 --> 01:33.206
in Bora Bora this week.

01:33.254 --> 01:34.154
No, you're right.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.045
Have a great time
on your retreat...

01:36.113 --> 01:38.393
On your only son's birthday.

01:38.934 --> 01:42.435
It is a spa trip, darling.
Not a guilt trip.

01:42.488 --> 01:44.674
Mwah. He's all yours.

01:44.925 --> 01:46.002
See you in a week.

01:46.048 --> 01:46.816
Bye.

01:46.868 --> 01:47.489
Oh, come on, Castle.

01:47.534 --> 01:49.333
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

01:49.391 --> 01:50.410
I'll get us a reservation

01:50.449 --> 01:52.073
and I'll take you somewhere
nice for your birthday.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.642
As nice as Bora Bora?

01:53.694 --> 01:54.469
Mm.

01:55.594 --> 01:56.544
Oh.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.507
Katherine, your ride is here.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.358
Oh, great.

01:59.401 --> 02:01.196
- Ride?
- Yeah, we had a body drop.

02:01.236 --> 02:02.221
I asked the boys to pick me up

02:02.271 --> 02:04.806
so I'd have enough time
to make you breakfast.

02:04.866 --> 02:07.347
I'm missing another case?
No. Come on.

02:07.401 --> 02:08.912
Guys, take me with you.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.661
No! Not until you get better.

02:10.828 --> 02:12.480
Castle, how's the knee?

02:12.528 --> 02:14.690
It's not the knee so
much as the boredom.

02:14.749 --> 02:16.041
I thought you writers
liked being alone.

02:16.069 --> 02:16.988
Yeah, if I could write.

02:17.041 --> 02:19.145
But the painkillers
make me a little loopy.

02:19.194 --> 02:21.134
Last night I used the
word "speculate"

02:21.178 --> 02:22.515
three times in the
same sentence.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.354
Mm. You must be bored.

02:24.620 --> 02:27.144
You've actually
gone "Rear Window."

02:27.183 --> 02:29.399
Alexis got me those as
a joke to cheer me up.

02:29.444 --> 02:31.876
I have not yet
resorted to voyeurism.

02:31.925 --> 02:33.852
Then you are missing out.

02:34.609 --> 02:36.752
- What? Let me see.
- No, hey--

02:37.331 --> 02:39.149
Dude, she was just about
to take off her towel.

02:39.391 --> 02:40.352
- Oh, the towel is off.
- Really?

02:40.919 --> 02:42.120
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

02:42.157 --> 02:43.757
Unless the body that
you're looking at is dead,

02:43.803 --> 02:45.993
I suggest you drop
those binoculars.

02:46.309 --> 02:47.316
Okay, Castle.

02:48.119 --> 02:49.739
I will call you and
check on you soon.

02:50.794 --> 02:52.396
Hey, what if I consult by phone?

02:52.450 --> 02:54.427
We could pretend I'm Charlie,
and you're my angels.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.754
Why are men such babies

03:01.797 --> 03:03.681
when they get sick or injured?

03:03.716 --> 03:04.821
It's an evolutionary thing.

03:04.848 --> 03:06.508
Men who can get women
to take care of 'em,

03:06.566 --> 03:08.322
well, they have a greater
chance of survival.

03:08.735 --> 03:10.277
Really, Espo?
Where'd you read that,

03:10.318 --> 03:11.366
"You're making it up" magazine?

03:13.632 --> 03:15.337
Hey, Lanie. So what have we got?

03:15.746 --> 03:18.279
Sorry, sweetie. It's a bad one.

03:18.321 --> 03:19.951
Multiple contusions to the head,

03:19.996 --> 03:22.393
evidence of fracturing at
the base of the skull.

03:22.434 --> 03:23.877
From the patterning,
I'd say she was

03:23.917 --> 03:26.256
repeatedly struck by that bat.

03:26.590 --> 03:27.765
Do we know who she is?

03:27.813 --> 03:30.708
The guard who found her ID'ed
her as Clara Dewinter--

03:30.752 --> 03:33.417
35, lives in Queens,
and married.

03:33.469 --> 03:34.550
What was she doing
in this alleyway

03:34.578 --> 03:35.397
in the middle of the night?

03:35.431 --> 03:36.816
She was an IRS agent.

03:36.859 --> 03:38.162
Worked in this building here.

03:38.298 --> 03:39.697
Apparently, she
was working late.

03:39.735 --> 03:41.190
The employees sometimes
cut across the alley

03:41.271 --> 03:42.714
to get to the parking
garage next door.

03:42.766 --> 03:43.565
Do we have a witness?

03:43.609 --> 03:46.008
No, but we may have
something way better.

03:49.408 --> 03:50.827
What the hell is that?

03:50.863 --> 03:51.959
No idea, ma'am.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.672
Never seen anything like it.

03:53.708 --> 03:54.552
Espo?

03:54.933 --> 03:56.365
It's an infrared camera.

03:56.423 --> 03:57.162
So our attacker could be wearing

03:57.237 --> 03:59.286
some sort of high-intensity
IR lights,

03:59.349 --> 04:02.499
which would be invisible to the
eye but blinding to that camera.

04:02.544 --> 04:04.345
That's pretty sophisticated
for a street criminal.

04:04.384 --> 04:05.778
No, this wasn't a street crime.

04:05.818 --> 04:08.746
The person knew that that camera
was there and took precautions.

04:08.794 --> 04:11.222
This was a premeditated murder.

04:11.266 --> 04:12.377
Wait. Go back.

04:14.034 --> 04:14.722
Right there.

04:15.106 --> 04:16.411
That's our killer's car.
All right.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.562
Let's have tech filter that
image for make and model

04:18.608 --> 04:19.685
and let's see if they can
get us a better look

04:19.726 --> 04:21.317
at our attacker's face.

04:22.831 --> 04:24.976
With all the cutbacks,
her workload increased.

04:25.545 --> 04:28.121
She'd stay late a couple of times
a week trying to catch up,

04:28.162 --> 04:30.519
and on those nights, I'd pick
up an extra shift at the store.

04:30.884 --> 04:32.524
And when was the last
time you saw her?

04:32.885 --> 04:33.762
We had dinner around 7:00,

04:33.800 --> 04:34.597
then, uh...

04:36.246 --> 04:37.537
we both went back to work.

04:39.056 --> 04:41.538
And how did she seem?
Was she nervous, upset?

04:41.586 --> 04:43.395
No. She was fine.

04:43.443 --> 04:46.029
And what--what exactly did
your wife do for the IRS?

04:46.088 --> 04:47.464
Uh, she was an investigator.

04:47.518 --> 04:48.957
She went after tax evaders.

04:48.999 --> 04:50.490
So she must have made enemies.

04:51.831 --> 04:53.836
Yeah, pretty much
everyone she audited.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.670
And was there anyone in particular
that she had trouble with?

04:59.259 --> 05:01.510
Actually... yeah.

05:01.541 --> 05:04.099
We were out at--out at dinner
a couple of weeks ago,

05:04.143 --> 05:06.578
a-and this guy comes barging
into the restaurant

05:06.621 --> 05:08.311
accusing Clara of
destroying his life.

05:08.358 --> 05:09.688
Did she tell you who he was?

05:09.735 --> 05:11.531
Just another tax
cheat she took down.

05:11.588 --> 05:12.519
She said it was no big deal,

05:12.559 --> 05:14.442
but I could tell,
she was rattled.

05:14.491 --> 05:15.541
Can you tell me what
he looked like?

05:15.580 --> 05:16.959
6 feet...

05:17.042 --> 05:18.070
dark hair.

05:18.096 --> 05:19.494
You should check with her work.

05:21.215 --> 05:23.484
She promised to file
a complaint, so...

05:28.728 --> 05:31.744
Looks like we got some beautiful
clear skies with us today.

05:31.783 --> 05:34.723
A nice tail wind's gonna get
us there right away, folks.

05:34.766 --> 05:37.900
We'll be there zero dark
thirty, zero dark quarter to.

05:38.683 --> 05:41.283
Nice, red five.
You're looking good.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.969
Oh, no.
I've got something wrong.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.153
Ooh, that's not good.

05:46.878 --> 05:48.033
Evade! Evade! Evade!

05:50.548 --> 05:51.981
No!

05:53.368 --> 05:54.788
Survivors.

06:09.581 --> 06:10.107
Look,

06:10.159 --> 06:11.647
most IRS agents get threats.

06:11.701 --> 06:12.992
It's the nature of our business.

06:13.041 --> 06:15.005
Did Mrs. Dewinter
report any recently?

06:15.056 --> 06:15.920
No.

06:16.153 --> 06:16.857
Are you sure?

06:16.899 --> 06:17.796
You have to understand,

06:17.837 --> 06:19.647
Clara was a rare breed--

06:19.694 --> 06:22.322
an IRS agent who actually
liked her job.

06:22.369 --> 06:23.811
What's that have to do
with her being threatened?

06:25.882 --> 06:26.827
The thing is,

06:27.331 --> 06:29.480
each threat requires
an investigation,

06:29.522 --> 06:31.414
which is a headache
for upstairs.

06:31.471 --> 06:33.942
It's an unwritten rule that
agents who report threats

06:34.006 --> 06:36.339
don't fare well on
performance reviews.

06:36.392 --> 06:38.208
Well, that unwritten rule
may have gotten her killed.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.870
And since you don't have
a record of the threat,

06:40.117 --> 06:41.743
we're gonna have to take a
look at her audit files

06:41.784 --> 06:43.106
going back at least a year.

06:49.427 --> 06:50.271
Hmm.

06:50.564 --> 06:52.054
Must be writers.

06:58.863 --> 07:01.646
Oh, that better be
for a sick child.

07:09.077 --> 07:11.108
Oh, to be young and...

07:11.373 --> 07:12.610
underemployed.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.499
Whoa. Hold on, guys.
Slow down.

07:18.549 --> 07:19.633
Not a race.

07:20.463 --> 07:21.950
Maybe close the blinds.

07:23.763 --> 07:25.099
Mm-hmm.

07:25.421 --> 07:27.445
All right, you kids.
You have fun.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.830
Someone's home early.

07:54.459 --> 07:55.538
Really?

07:55.570 --> 07:57.173
You're gonna kiss him now?

08:06.802 --> 08:08.036
Oh, maybe next time,
you'll think twice

08:08.087 --> 08:09.747
about being cheatin' cheaters.

08:18.467 --> 08:19.459
Uh-oh.

08:20.943 --> 08:23.522
Someone's got some
'splaining to do.

08:25.601 --> 08:26.359
Hey, guys.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.457
So... tech couldn't
get us a better look

08:29.514 --> 08:30.587
at the attacker's face,

08:30.625 --> 08:33.234
but they're hoping to have an ID
on the car by morning.

08:33.289 --> 08:34.139
How's it going in here?

08:34.174 --> 08:35.417
Well, Clara's colleagues
don't remember

08:35.456 --> 08:37.433
her mentioning any
explicit threat.

08:37.485 --> 08:39.530
But if we're looking for people
whose lives were ruined,

08:39.558 --> 08:40.890
there's no shortage of suspects.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.798
We've got houses that
were repossessed,

08:42.841 --> 08:44.789
bank accounts that were seized,
businesses that were shut down,

08:44.839 --> 08:46.061
and we're only a
couple of months in.

08:46.098 --> 08:47.563
Okay, so let's put
a list together

08:47.601 --> 08:49.957
and pull photos...
see if the husband recognizes anyone.

08:50.036 --> 08:51.123
Right.

08:52.854 --> 08:53.981
Hey, Castle.

08:54.608 --> 08:55.541
Where are you?

08:56.386 --> 08:57.874
I'm at work. Why?

08:58.036 --> 08:59.986
You said you were
bringing home dinner.

09:00.282 --> 09:01.830
Yes, on my way home.

09:02.392 --> 09:03.795
So when are you leaving?

09:04.106 --> 09:05.342
Soon.

09:05.891 --> 09:06.933
When's soon?

09:06.974 --> 09:07.814
Like in...

09:07.860 --> 09:08.745
half an hour.

09:08.792 --> 09:09.988
Fine.

09:12.540 --> 09:13.678
Shut up.

09:29.321 --> 09:31.571
Ooh, he is so on to you.

09:32.073 --> 09:34.123
Ah. Uh-huh.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.782
Here it comes--

09:35.911 --> 09:38.357
the inevitable, huge breakup.

09:59.424 --> 10:00.819
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:00.856 --> 10:02.734
Don't, don't.
Don't take the knife.

10:02.772 --> 10:03.983
Don't...

10:09.521 --> 10:10.417
No. Uh...

10:18.238 --> 10:19.643
Castle, I'm not gonna
get there any faster--

10:19.681 --> 10:21.113
Oh, no, no, no, no, Beckett,
Beckett, listen...

10:21.890 --> 10:23.247
I think I just saw a murder.

10:40.275 --> 10:41.637
Why aren't they arresting him?

10:43.636 --> 10:46.382
Look, I know what I saw.

10:46.817 --> 10:49.597
He took a knife and followed
her into the bedroom.

10:49.637 --> 10:50.689
I looked in the bedroom.

10:50.724 --> 10:52.972
Everything was fine.
No blood, no body, I swear.

10:53.009 --> 10:55.168
Did you look under the
bed, in the closet?

10:55.215 --> 10:57.977
Castle, the guy was relaxed
and fully cooperative.

10:58.019 --> 10:59.531
He let us poke around
without a warrant.

10:59.582 --> 11:00.974
So he probably hid the body.

11:01.018 --> 11:03.269
If he was completely calm,
he could be a psychopath.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.749
What did he say about the girl?

11:04.799 --> 11:07.648
He admitted they had a fight,
they broke up, and she left.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.080
Not possible.
I would've seen her.

11:09.119 --> 11:10.954
So you were watching
the whole time?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.058
I...

11:13.161 --> 11:14.322
Well, not the entire time.
I had to--

11:14.368 --> 11:17.730
So she could've left
and you didn't see?

11:18.158 --> 11:19.698
It's possible, but--

11:19.744 --> 11:21.048
Because he called her.

11:22.069 --> 11:24.429
Handed me the phone.
I spoke to her.

11:24.763 --> 11:26.692
She confirmed his story.
She was in the car

11:26.729 --> 11:28.715
on her way to her mom's
house in Philadelphia.

11:28.779 --> 11:30.037
All right, thanks, guys.

11:35.031 --> 11:36.137
I'm not crazy.

11:36.172 --> 11:38.257
No, but you do have a
vivid imagination...

11:38.294 --> 11:40.194
And you've been stuck
inside for two weeks.

11:41.319 --> 11:42.877
What were you doing looking
out the window anyway?

11:42.925 --> 11:44.328
- I was...
- Bored?

11:45.152 --> 11:47.144
So you saw what you
wanted to see.

11:49.239 --> 11:50.768
When did you take
your last painkiller?

11:50.875 --> 11:52.426
I was not hallucinating.

11:52.474 --> 11:53.026
Come on, Castle.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.343
You're here with a
broken leg, binoculars,

11:55.399 --> 11:57.706
seeing a "Rear Window" scenario
play out across the way.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.205
I mean, what are the odds?

12:00.554 --> 12:01.975
Astronomical.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.371
All right.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.281
I'm gonna make us some dinner
and then get you to bed.

12:31.763 --> 12:32.636
Seriously?

12:35.878 --> 12:36.881
Oh.

12:36.918 --> 12:37.879
I can explain.

12:37.927 --> 12:38.732
Please don't.

12:38.779 --> 12:41.530
Listen, he was pacing back
and forth in his apartment,

12:41.577 --> 12:43.479
and he kept looking
towards the bedroom.

12:43.525 --> 12:45.838
And then he slept on the couch.

12:45.894 --> 12:47.250
Now why would you
sleep on the couch

12:47.285 --> 12:48.547
when you have a
perfectly good bed?

12:48.592 --> 12:50.238
I could ask you the
same question.

12:50.277 --> 12:51.062
I'll tell you why.

12:51.102 --> 12:52.281
Because he had a
dead body in there.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.787
Ryan and Esposito didn't find it

12:53.833 --> 12:54.790
because he hid it.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.839
Do you realize
what you're doing?

12:56.913 --> 12:58.322
You're obsessing over this

12:58.367 --> 13:01.267
because you have nothing
else to obsess about.

13:01.732 --> 13:03.872
Why don't you just come
with me to the precinct?

13:03.911 --> 13:05.006
Focus on a real murder

13:05.064 --> 13:07.483
instead of wasting your
time on an imaginary one.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.414
Well, actually, I was
thinking about just, uh,

13:10.471 --> 13:12.181
trying to do some writing today.

13:12.941 --> 13:15.147
Okay, as long as by
"writing," you don't mean

13:15.200 --> 13:18.254
staring out the window and
ogling at your neighbors.

13:18.295 --> 13:21.078
No. That would be
immoral and intrusive.

13:21.474 --> 13:23.591
Yeah, like you've never
done that before.

13:29.616 --> 13:30.339
Hey.

13:30.384 --> 13:32.435
Hey. How's Jimmy Stewart?

13:33.048 --> 13:34.202
You know, up half the night

13:34.238 --> 13:35.951
waiting for the neighbor
to move the body.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.354
So did tech get anything

13:37.385 --> 13:38.702
on our killer's
car in the alley?

13:38.766 --> 13:41.411
Yeah, they identified
it as a late-model,

13:41.451 --> 13:43.826
light-colored CLS550.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.051
I've got folks combing
over Clara's audit records

13:46.105 --> 13:48.329
to see if anyone lists that
vehicle on their return.

13:48.408 --> 13:48.918
Hey.

13:48.967 --> 13:50.342
So I just got off the phone

13:50.389 --> 13:52.116
with security at Clara's office.

13:52.150 --> 13:52.856
A few weeks back,

13:53.091 --> 13:55.771
this guy tried to muscle
his way past security.

13:55.813 --> 13:58.444
Now they tried to detain
him, but he broke free

13:58.502 --> 14:00.135
and he tore out of the
parking lot in...

14:00.195 --> 14:01.225
A CLS550.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.221
This looks like the guy Gavin
said was after his wife.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.918
Yeah, so I compared that photo
to Clara's audit files,

14:05.972 --> 14:07.188
and I got a hit on this guy--

14:07.692 --> 14:08.754
Dan Renner.

14:08.798 --> 14:11.011
He is an anti-government
pro-freedom hothead

14:11.054 --> 14:13.293
who made a fortune on a chain
of dry cleaners in Brooklyn

14:13.340 --> 14:15.593
that he's neglected to pay
taxes on in nearly a decade.

14:15.649 --> 14:17.973
And because of Clara's audit,
he's facing criminal charges

14:18.015 --> 14:19.678
and his wife just
filed for divorce.

14:19.737 --> 14:21.390
Sounds like someone who
has an ax to grind.

14:21.436 --> 14:22.791
Or a bat to swing.
Pick him up.

14:22.995 --> 14:23.941
Yeah.

14:28.113 --> 14:30.693
You bought rope and a tarp.

14:31.361 --> 14:33.445
Now what would you
need a tarp for?

14:39.271 --> 14:40.189
It's blood.

14:41.221 --> 14:42.329
You're washing away the--

14:42.384 --> 14:43.778
He's washing away the bl--

14:52.835 --> 14:55.041
They took my house, my marriage,

14:55.233 --> 14:57.122
I was facing a jail sentence.

14:57.181 --> 14:58.076
So, yeah,

14:58.240 --> 15:00.007
I wanted to have a few
words with Mrs. Dewinter...

15:00.049 --> 15:01.520
About the land of the free.

15:01.575 --> 15:03.063
That doesn't mean I killed her.

15:03.822 --> 15:05.000
You know what that is?

15:05.209 --> 15:08.336
That's a silver CLS550, just
like the one you drive,

15:08.377 --> 15:09.851
fleeing her murder scene.

15:09.914 --> 15:11.854
Just like the one I drove.

15:12.502 --> 15:15.856
Look, my 550 was seized by
federal agents two weeks ago.

15:16.236 --> 15:17.418
You can check.

15:17.671 --> 15:20.123
And given what Mrs. Dewinter
was gonna do for me,

15:20.656 --> 15:22.744
I'm the last person
who wanted her dead.

15:22.792 --> 15:24.378
Going to do for you?

15:25.762 --> 15:26.794
Yeah.

15:26.852 --> 15:28.501
She came to see me a week ago,

15:28.546 --> 15:31.279
said she needed a favor,
and if I helped her,

15:31.348 --> 15:33.437
she'd make the criminal
charges go away.

15:33.495 --> 15:34.249
What kind of a favor

15:34.312 --> 15:36.434
could she possibly
have wanted from you?

15:36.503 --> 15:37.902
Because of how well
I hid my money--

15:37.966 --> 15:39.857
fake names, multiple IDs--

15:40.240 --> 15:42.103
she asked me to
help her disappear.

15:42.164 --> 15:43.110
Disappear?

15:43.157 --> 15:45.615
Yeah. She said if I helped
her get a new identity,

15:45.681 --> 15:47.164
she'd help me get my life back.

15:47.223 --> 15:48.954
And why would she
want a new identity?

15:49.007 --> 15:50.020
She didn't say.

15:50.454 --> 15:52.400
But now she's dead,
and I'm screwed.

15:53.186 --> 15:56.364
Mr. Renner, where were you
2 nights ago at 1:38 AM?

15:56.431 --> 15:57.628
At my sister's.

15:58.746 --> 16:00.864
Beckett, Castle's calling.

16:00.912 --> 16:02.350
He says it's an emergency.

16:02.408 --> 16:04.356
This is not an emergency.

16:04.414 --> 16:06.973
I caught him red-handed.
Literally red-handed.

16:07.052 --> 16:08.692
Ooh, so then it's
gotta be blood?

16:08.761 --> 16:09.777
What else could it be?

16:09.831 --> 16:11.424
Red paint, tomato juice,

16:11.488 --> 16:13.504
beets, red velvet cupcakes.

16:13.562 --> 16:15.742
He bought a tarp and a rope.

16:15.816 --> 16:17.116
He brought them
into the bedroom,

16:17.185 --> 16:18.436
where I'm betting right now,

16:18.507 --> 16:20.588
he's cutting her into
portable pieces.

16:20.663 --> 16:21.548
Get a warrant.

16:21.644 --> 16:24.113
Search that place before
there's no evidence left.

16:24.161 --> 16:25.633
Esposito spoke to the girl.

16:25.688 --> 16:27.209
We know she's alive.

16:27.299 --> 16:28.947
How do you know
it's the same girl?

16:29.038 --> 16:31.889
It's possible he paid
someone to be his alibi.

16:31.936 --> 16:35.341
Or it's possible something else
entirely is going on here.

16:36.003 --> 16:37.104
Look...

16:37.462 --> 16:40.267
I know that you're lonely
and that you miss me.

16:40.309 --> 16:41.092
I miss you, too.

16:41.139 --> 16:43.716
But you don't have to
keep making up things

16:43.759 --> 16:44.942
to have me come back here.

16:44.987 --> 16:47.415
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think this is a ploy to get you here?

16:47.455 --> 16:48.408
Look, I don't mean to be that--

16:48.446 --> 16:50.248
No, I know what you mean.
All right?

16:50.290 --> 16:51.853
And I know what I saw.

16:52.964 --> 16:54.059
All right, you know what?

16:54.301 --> 16:56.011
I have to get back
to the precinct.

16:56.272 --> 16:58.071
Wow.
You really don't believe me.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.370
I'll be back later.

16:59.428 --> 17:01.931
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

17:03.535 --> 17:04.589
I'm fine.

17:14.204 --> 17:14.979
Yo.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.566
What was the emergency?

17:16.798 --> 17:18.051
He wanted me to get a warrant

17:18.095 --> 17:19.896
to search the place
across the way.

17:20.481 --> 17:22.954
Looks like he's taking this
whole thing pretty seriously.

17:23.238 --> 17:24.525
Should we be worried?

17:24.891 --> 17:26.602
I just hope he doesn't
do something stupid.

17:26.642 --> 17:28.227
Where--where are we
with Dan Renner?

17:28.385 --> 17:29.426
His alibi checks out,

17:29.458 --> 17:31.184
and he was telling the
truth about his car.

17:31.533 --> 17:33.570
Maybe he's telling the
truth about Clara as well.

17:34.404 --> 17:35.719
Let's dig deeper into her life,

17:35.757 --> 17:37.085
see if we can find anything.

17:37.835 --> 17:38.548
Thanks.

17:47.374 --> 17:49.081
Oh! Ohh.

18:00.894 --> 18:02.300
He's getting rid of the body.

18:03.684 --> 18:05.469
Beckett's gonna have
to believe me now.

18:06.261 --> 18:07.142
Okay.

18:10.278 --> 18:12.185
Where's the... there we go.
There we--there we go.

18:17.507 --> 18:18.828
No. No. No!

18:23.934 --> 18:25.500
If you thought he was
getting rid of the body,

18:25.544 --> 18:26.857
why didn't you call Beckett?

18:26.915 --> 18:28.736
Well, she thinks it's
all in my head--

18:28.897 --> 18:31.429
a by-product of my
imagination and pain pills.

18:31.484 --> 18:32.503
Like that time you
were convinced

18:32.535 --> 18:33.747
my art teacher was
a serial killer.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.385
Come on.
He looked just like the guy

18:35.436 --> 18:36.850
from "America's Most Wanted."

18:38.099 --> 18:39.666
Did you ever stop
to think that maybe

18:39.709 --> 18:41.479
there's an innocent
explanation for everything?

18:41.522 --> 18:42.169
All right,

18:42.170 --> 18:44.437
what is the innocent explanation
for rolling up a rug

18:44.484 --> 18:47.183
and taking it out of your
apartment at 3:00 AM?

18:48.330 --> 18:49.499
Yeah.

18:50.501 --> 18:52.633
That is pretty weird.

18:52.981 --> 18:53.516
Right?

18:53.556 --> 18:56.263
And then he didn't come back
until 4:30 this morning.

18:56.428 --> 18:57.444
Where'd he go?

18:58.280 --> 18:59.729
I don't know, but he's up now.

19:00.802 --> 19:01.895
What's he doing?

19:03.027 --> 19:05.136
- Uh, I--he, uh--
- What?

19:05.354 --> 19:06.439
What do you see?

19:06.494 --> 19:08.955
He's taking off his clothes.

19:09.001 --> 19:10.100
What? Give me those.

19:10.133 --> 19:12.010
Mm. He's cute.

19:12.052 --> 19:12.688
- Ooh.
- All right.

19:12.725 --> 19:13.638
No, I...

19:14.790 --> 19:15.835
Seriously?

19:21.002 --> 19:22.370
You shouldn't be watching this.

19:22.418 --> 19:23.887
Yeah, neither should you.

19:32.140 --> 19:32.711
What the...

19:32.748 --> 19:34.091
That's creepy.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.534
Staring at the phone

19:37.561 --> 19:38.785
won't make it ring.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.328
I learned that in junior high.

19:40.435 --> 19:41.799
You know what?
Maybe I should go over there.

19:41.852 --> 19:43.116
I mean, his birthday
is tomorrow--

19:43.149 --> 19:44.747
Trust me.
He'll call when he's ready.

19:44.776 --> 19:46.042
And you're not gonna
want to miss this.

19:46.084 --> 19:48.247
We went back through all
of Clara's records.

19:48.283 --> 19:50.379
Turns out that she was
hiding something.

19:50.420 --> 19:52.299
Over half a million dollars
in a secret bank account.

19:52.344 --> 19:53.801
She used every legal
trick to hide it.

19:53.802 --> 19:55.648
Nobody, not even her
husband, knew about it.

19:55.651 --> 19:57.278
This girl made 75k a year.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.141
How'd she get her
hands on half a mil?

19:59.142 --> 20:01.474
Well, at first we thought she
was shaking down her auditees,

20:01.475 --> 20:03.466
but then we traced the deposits.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.177
All from businesses
owned or affiliated

20:05.178 --> 20:06.450
to Tommy Valentino.

20:06.451 --> 20:08.581
Tommy "The Shark" Valentino?

20:09.089 --> 20:11.793
Why is an IRS agent taking
payoffs from a crime boss?

20:11.794 --> 20:13.318
I don't know, but
wanting to disappear

20:13.319 --> 20:14.756
and then getting
whacked in an alley--

20:14.757 --> 20:16.110
it's all starting to make sense.

20:19.685 --> 20:20.626
It's been two hours.

20:20.627 --> 20:21.619
What's he doing in there?

20:21.620 --> 20:22.787
Getting rid of evidence--

20:23.630 --> 20:26.046
blood stains... trace DNA.

20:26.047 --> 20:27.714
Pretty soon, there's
gonna be nothing left.

20:28.287 --> 20:30.002
Oh, here he comes.
Here he comes.

20:32.226 --> 20:33.684
What's in the bags?

20:33.792 --> 20:35.363
He took the body out in a rug.

20:35.905 --> 20:37.622
That could be clothing, bedding.

20:39.242 --> 20:40.545
That's her purse.

20:40.546 --> 20:42.541
If they broke up, no way she
left without her purse.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.145
She did not leave
that apartment,

20:44.146 --> 20:45.535
at least not alive.

20:46.006 --> 20:47.916
And now he's obliterating
her identity.

20:47.917 --> 20:48.853
We need to call Beckett.

20:48.854 --> 20:50.026
And tell her what?

20:50.142 --> 20:53.194
That we saw a man donning
gloves and--and a respirator?

20:53.195 --> 20:54.599
For all we know, he's
cleaning the bathroom.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.425
No.

20:56.203 --> 20:58.656
If I'm gonna convince
Beckett I'm not crazy,

20:59.081 --> 21:00.270
I need proof,

21:00.952 --> 21:02.176
something solid.

21:06.004 --> 21:07.611
Dad, you can't break
in to his apartment.

21:07.612 --> 21:09.363
All the evidence we need
is in that shredder.

21:09.364 --> 21:10.385
It'll tell us who the victim is.

21:10.386 --> 21:11.425
We can prove she's missing.

21:11.426 --> 21:12.679
And what if he catches you?

21:12.680 --> 21:15.035
He won't, not if I
have your help.

21:15.198 --> 21:18.166
Next time he leaves,
I'll slip over there.

21:18.317 --> 21:22.173
You keep watch, make sure
he's not coming back.

21:22.304 --> 21:25.163
I go inside, I get
whatever's in that shredder,

21:25.164 --> 21:26.662
and I get out.

21:26.663 --> 21:28.075
Two minutes, tops.

21:28.076 --> 21:29.054
On crutches?

21:29.055 --> 21:30.577
The doctor did say I
need more exercise.

21:30.578 --> 21:32.788
What if I go?
I'm smaller, faster, and younger.

21:32.789 --> 21:34.178
Oh, no, no, no.
If you get caught,

21:34.179 --> 21:35.318
you get a B&E on your record,

21:35.319 --> 21:36.460
and you'll never
become president.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.418
Dad...

21:37.760 --> 21:40.338
He's getting away with murder.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.111
You got a better plan?

21:47.273 --> 21:49.076
You got a long list of
indictments against you,

21:49.077 --> 21:50.516
Mr. Valentino--

21:50.517 --> 21:52.881
assault, racketeering,
murder one--

21:52.882 --> 21:54.932
and yet, no convictions.

21:54.933 --> 21:55.872
I'm lucky that way.

21:55.873 --> 21:57.256
Yeah, well, your luck's
about to run out.

21:57.257 --> 21:59.964
I have evidence connecting you
to payments made to my vic--

21:59.965 --> 22:00.896
Clara Dewinter.

22:00.897 --> 22:01.929
My client has no comment.

22:01.930 --> 22:04.399
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Someone killed Clara?

22:04.400 --> 22:05.724
Oh, it looks like he
does have a comment.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.309
So you're admitting
to knowing her?

22:07.565 --> 22:08.481
Yeah.

22:09.361 --> 22:10.404
But I didn't kill her.

22:10.405 --> 22:12.152
She was my tax consultant.

22:12.506 --> 22:15.149
You paid an IRS agent
half a million dollars

22:15.150 --> 22:16.836
to act as your tax consultant?

22:16.837 --> 22:19.309
You bet your ass.
No one's gonna Al Capone me.

22:19.310 --> 22:20.972
Okay, if this was a
legitimate arrangement,

22:20.973 --> 22:22.733
then why did Clara Dewinter
go to such lengths

22:22.734 --> 22:24.076
to keep that money hidden?

22:24.961 --> 22:26.906
She hid the money
from her husband.

22:27.186 --> 22:28.975
That's why she took this
job in the first place.

22:28.976 --> 22:30.192
She was afraid of him.

22:30.430 --> 22:32.031
She needed the
money to get away.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.987
Tommy The Shark's alibi holds.

22:34.988 --> 22:37.934
He was with some associates
at a nightclub that he owns.

22:37.935 --> 22:39.309
Doesn't mean he didn't
send one of his boys.

22:39.310 --> 22:41.828
Look, if he killed Clara, he
wouldn't have talked to me.

22:41.898 --> 22:42.698
No.

22:42.699 --> 22:44.591
Hiding the money,
planning to disappear--

22:44.592 --> 22:46.192
something else is going on here.

22:46.193 --> 22:47.607
So what do you got
on the husband?

22:47.665 --> 22:48.856
Oh, not much.

22:48.857 --> 22:51.493
He's a manager at a big-name
supermarket in Queens,

22:51.494 --> 22:53.387
no priors, married seven years.

22:53.445 --> 22:56.165
Oh, and he took a million-dollar
life insurance policy out

22:56.166 --> 22:57.398
on his wife only
three months ago.

22:57.399 --> 22:59.009
- Mm.
- That's not suspicious.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.373
You think he did it
and set Renner up?

23:00.374 --> 23:01.840
After what happened
at the restaurant,

23:01.841 --> 23:02.660
it would've been easy.

23:02.661 --> 23:05.382
All he'd have to do is rent
Renner's same CLS sedan

23:05.383 --> 23:06.507
and keep his face hidden.

23:06.508 --> 23:08.091
While making sure
the car was seen.

23:08.645 --> 23:10.112
All right. Pick him up.

23:22.455 --> 23:23.912
All clear. Over.

24:05.130 --> 24:06.219
Dad, no.

24:06.220 --> 24:08.380
Just get the stuff and
get out of there. Over.

24:08.810 --> 24:10.826
It'll only take a minute. Over.

24:44.354 --> 24:45.713
Bleach and paint.

24:46.772 --> 24:48.484
What are you trying to cover up?

24:57.238 --> 24:58.622
Bloodstains?

24:59.680 --> 25:00.797
This is it!

25:01.388 --> 25:02.290
This is where he killed her.

25:02.291 --> 25:04.388
This is why Ryan
didn't see any blood.

25:04.389 --> 25:05.643
It was all in here!

25:13.623 --> 25:15.837
Dad. Dad, he's coming back.

25:19.699 --> 25:20.566
Get out of there.

25:20.567 --> 25:21.649
Get out now!

25:29.090 --> 25:30.048
Dad?

25:31.287 --> 25:32.222
Dad?

25:54.005 --> 25:54.903
Yeah.

25:56.935 --> 25:59.427
He's coming in. Dad!
Dad! He's coming in!

25:59.587 --> 26:00.702
No, I have it handled for now,

26:00.703 --> 26:02.375
but I can't leave
it there forever.

26:02.521 --> 26:03.842
Oh, no! Oh!

26:04.999 --> 26:05.875
No.

26:06.891 --> 26:08.368
Well, I was thinking
Jimmy's boat.

26:10.077 --> 26:11.246
While he's at work.

26:12.787 --> 26:13.906
He'd never know.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.126
You think I did this?

26:41.127 --> 26:43.729
You think I could
possibly hurt my wife?

26:43.730 --> 26:45.674
I told you, we were happy.

26:45.675 --> 26:47.207
Not according to her sister.

26:47.208 --> 26:50.141
She claims that Clara
was terrified of you.

26:50.142 --> 26:50.728
Her sister?

26:50.729 --> 26:52.718
That woman's had it out for
me since we started dating.

26:52.719 --> 26:54.660
Then why did Clara
hide money from you,

26:54.661 --> 26:56.178
and why was she planning
on disappearing?

26:56.179 --> 26:57.225
How should I know?

26:57.259 --> 26:59.346
You took out a sizeable
life insurance policy

26:59.347 --> 27:00.609
against your wife
three months ago.

27:00.610 --> 27:01.604
Why?

27:05.039 --> 27:07.191
I'd like my lawyer. Now.

27:08.664 --> 27:09.692
The supermarket confirmed

27:09.693 --> 27:11.199
he was there the
night of the murder.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.581
Came in at 10:00, left at 3:00.
Can't be him.

27:13.582 --> 27:14.672
All right, get up to that store

27:14.673 --> 27:16.087
and talk to everyone that
was there that night.

27:16.088 --> 27:18.114
Tear apart his financials
and his phone records.

27:18.115 --> 27:19.084
If he hired someone...

27:19.085 --> 27:20.261
we gotta find out who.

27:21.178 --> 27:22.117
Beckett.

27:22.283 --> 27:23.934
Wait. You did what?

27:24.387 --> 27:25.393
And you helped him?

27:25.394 --> 27:26.283
I di--ah, okay.

27:26.284 --> 27:28.378
This is not about what we did.

27:28.379 --> 27:29.879
This is about what he did.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.968
And... check this out.

27:31.969 --> 27:33.433
Now I wasn't able to...

27:33.659 --> 27:35.702
reassemble the
credit cards, but...

27:36.958 --> 27:38.331
I found this in the bag.

27:40.236 --> 27:42.656
An invoice from a
storage facility. So?

27:42.657 --> 27:46.070
Not just any storage facility.
This one's open 24 hours.

27:46.071 --> 27:47.515
Yeah, look what time
he rented the space.

27:47.627 --> 27:48.743
3:43 AM.

27:48.744 --> 27:49.946
Last night at 3:00 AM,

27:49.947 --> 27:52.289
I watched him pull a rug
out of his apartment.

27:52.290 --> 27:53.607
You know what fits in a rug?

27:53.608 --> 27:54.609
A body.

27:54.985 --> 27:56.066
That's where he's storing her

27:56.067 --> 27:57.220
until he can figure
out what to do.

27:57.221 --> 27:58.931
Or the rug belongs
to his girlfriend,

27:58.932 --> 28:00.222
who asked him to
keep it in storage

28:00.223 --> 28:01.706
until she's ready to pick it up.

28:03.107 --> 28:04.057
All right.

28:04.058 --> 28:06.635
Then explain the
bleach, the paint.

28:06.636 --> 28:08.270
And I overheard him say,

28:08.308 --> 28:10.096
"I can't keep it there forever."

28:10.251 --> 28:11.804
Dad, look. Someone's coming.

28:18.988 --> 28:19.940
That's him.

28:19.941 --> 28:21.633
That's the guy she was
having an affair with.

28:21.634 --> 28:24.414
He's looking for her.
He wants to know where she is.

28:29.033 --> 28:31.130
If you leave now,
you can catch him.

28:31.131 --> 28:32.208
You can ask him where she is.

28:32.209 --> 28:32.815
Castle--

28:32.816 --> 28:35.621
Look, if she's really
visiting her mother,

28:35.622 --> 28:37.618
wouldn't the guy she's
having the affair with,

28:37.619 --> 28:38.809
who broke them up,

28:39.188 --> 28:40.574
be the first to know?

28:50.133 --> 28:52.234
Excuse me. Hey! Excuse me.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.738
NYPD. Do you have a minute?

29:07.926 --> 29:09.343
So his name is Brent Lansky.

29:09.344 --> 29:12.013
He and Emily have been taking
a class together at Pace,

29:12.014 --> 29:14.207
and he's been texting her for
the past couple of days,

29:14.208 --> 29:16.424
but so far there's
been no response.

29:16.425 --> 29:17.505
What about her parents?

29:17.506 --> 29:18.825
Ryan tracked them down,

29:18.826 --> 29:20.508
but they haven't heard
from her either.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.496
So I'm not a drug-addled crazy?

29:22.497 --> 29:23.717
Look, I know it
sounds suspicious,

29:23.718 --> 29:25.818
but without a body or a
missing person's report,

29:25.819 --> 29:27.175
I've got nothing to go on.

29:27.176 --> 29:29.220
Well, while you're waiting
for something to go on,

29:29.221 --> 29:30.848
he's already taken most
of the evidence away.

29:30.849 --> 29:33.861
But luckily, I know
what he's done with--

29:33.862 --> 29:34.832
Thank you.

29:35.776 --> 29:37.707
With the body-- in
the storage unit.

29:37.903 --> 29:40.103
You're talking about
an illegal search.

29:40.104 --> 29:41.900
When you do it, it's
an illegal search.

29:41.901 --> 29:44.725
When I do it, it's just illegal.

29:46.227 --> 29:48.481
Castle, this is such a bad idea.

29:48.482 --> 29:50.936
No, this is a brilliant idea.

29:50.937 --> 29:53.171
I break in, I find the body,

29:53.172 --> 29:54.923
then I call downstairs
to the front desk,

29:54.924 --> 29:57.537
tell them that the
lock has been cut.

29:57.538 --> 29:59.841
When they come up to see
if everything's okay,

29:59.842 --> 30:02.140
they find the body
they call the police,

30:02.141 --> 30:03.457
and you have probable cause.

30:03.458 --> 30:04.702
If you stay out here
in the hallway,

30:04.703 --> 30:06.619
you won't be violating
anyone's rights.

30:10.713 --> 30:11.911
There it is.

30:16.968 --> 30:18.057
Okay.

30:20.767 --> 30:22.135
I did not think
this part through.

30:22.136 --> 30:23.237
If you'd just...

30:23.626 --> 30:25.217
Fine, Castle.
But I was never here.

30:25.218 --> 30:26.460
Just unroll it.

30:32.821 --> 30:33.972
Where's the body?

30:37.579 --> 30:38.862
It's in the bags.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.412
Oh, my God. It's her.

30:52.543 --> 30:53.528
Castle...

30:53.653 --> 30:54.783
It's a wig.

30:56.007 --> 30:57.588
And there's clothes in here.

30:57.947 --> 31:00.369
Now can we get outta
here before someone...

31:01.977 --> 31:03.198
sees us?

31:12.611 --> 31:15.483
Illegal search,
breaking and entering?

31:15.484 --> 31:17.165
You're lucky I don't
have your badge.

31:17.166 --> 31:20.142
And you. What in the hell did
you think you were doing?

31:20.143 --> 31:22.802
But all the evidence-- the
rug, the storage space--

31:22.803 --> 31:23.870
Evidence?

31:24.058 --> 31:27.498
I just spoke to your alleged
killer, Mr. Castle.

31:27.499 --> 31:31.075
He got that storage space at
his ex-girlfriend's request.

31:31.076 --> 31:32.994
He was moving her
belongings there,

31:32.995 --> 31:34.534
including her rug.

31:34.535 --> 31:35.755
How do you know he's
telling the truth?

31:35.756 --> 31:36.549
No one's heard from her.

31:36.550 --> 31:39.212
We contacted her. She's fine.

31:41.229 --> 31:43.103
Well, what about the paint
and the--and the bleach?

31:43.104 --> 31:45.803
He discovered mold and
wanted to take care of it.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.083
Anything else?

31:47.522 --> 31:49.193
- Just--
- Uh, sir, Castle is just--

31:49.194 --> 31:51.356
Embarrassing me and
the department?

31:51.857 --> 31:54.040
Oh, and, Mr. Castle,

31:54.091 --> 31:57.129
your neighbor did say that if
you bother him in any way,

31:57.130 --> 31:58.945
he will press charges.

31:59.064 --> 32:00.100
And I will be

32:00.101 --> 32:03.576
so happy to take you
into custody personally.

32:08.788 --> 32:09.748
Hey, Castle.

32:09.749 --> 32:11.604
Is it hard to balance
on those crutches

32:11.605 --> 32:13.309
when you've just had
your ass chewed off?

32:14.706 --> 32:15.933
I'll be in the car.

32:20.284 --> 32:22.982
Did you two comedians find out
anything new on the husband?

32:23.196 --> 32:25.193
Well, there was nothing
unusual in his phone

32:25.194 --> 32:26.401
or financial records.

32:26.402 --> 32:27.549
And we talked to
everyone at the store.

32:27.550 --> 32:28.609
They said he was
there all night.

32:28.610 --> 32:31.524
But they did say that
he was acting weird.

32:31.585 --> 32:32.626
Weird how?

32:32.644 --> 32:34.885
Well, normally on a late shift,
he holes up in his office.

32:34.886 --> 32:37.380
But that night, he spent
all his time on the floor.

32:37.533 --> 32:39.582
He wanted to be seen
'cause he needed an alibi.

32:39.583 --> 32:40.836
That guy is involved.

32:40.837 --> 32:42.756
It's a great theory.
There's only one problem.

32:43.039 --> 32:44.159
We have no proof.

32:44.490 --> 32:45.530
Yet.

32:50.004 --> 32:51.926
Well, I don't say this often,

32:51.927 --> 32:54.173
but... I'm sorry.

32:54.834 --> 32:56.224
I'm sorry I got
you into trouble,

32:56.225 --> 32:58.625
sorry I... lost my mind.

32:58.898 --> 33:00.418
You know what, Castle?
It's okay.

33:00.419 --> 33:01.850
Your overactive imagination

33:01.851 --> 33:04.232
has actually brought a lot
of people to justice.

33:04.233 --> 33:07.390
In fact, it's one of the
things that I love about you.

33:10.040 --> 33:12.623
And... wow.

33:12.872 --> 33:14.450
Happy birthday to me.

33:15.547 --> 33:18.401
If that's my present, I
can't wait to unwrap it.

33:18.402 --> 33:20.290
Later. Right now, let's just
forget about the murder,

33:20.291 --> 33:21.513
go to dinner,
celebrate your life,

33:21.514 --> 33:23.680
come back, and
celebrate some more.

33:23.681 --> 33:24.873
Sounds perfect.

33:24.874 --> 33:27.377
Okay, so the car's gonna
be here in 15 minutes.

33:27.378 --> 33:29.881
Would you like a drink
from the fridge?

33:31.670 --> 33:32.878
The fridge.

33:33.002 --> 33:33.975
What?

33:34.553 --> 33:36.374
He just got a soda
from the cabinet.

33:36.674 --> 33:37.678
So?

33:38.737 --> 33:39.944
So why get it from the cabinet?

33:39.945 --> 33:41.212
Why not get it from the fridge?

33:41.213 --> 33:43.589
Why not... get ice?

33:43.590 --> 33:44.487
Oh, no.

33:44.488 --> 33:46.285
She's in the refrigerator.

33:46.286 --> 33:48.273
Oh, God.
Those plastic trays in the closet?

33:48.274 --> 33:50.435
Those weren't plastic trays.
Those were refrigerator shelves.

33:50.436 --> 33:51.302
Castle...

33:51.336 --> 33:53.129
I don't know who Gates was
talking to on the phone,

33:53.130 --> 33:54.415
but that was not Emily.

33:54.416 --> 33:55.690
Emily is in that fridge.

33:55.691 --> 33:58.270
She's not in the apartment.
She's not in the fridge.

33:58.271 --> 33:59.484
There is no body!

33:59.485 --> 34:00.544
Yes, there is.

34:00.569 --> 34:02.550
Castle, you just
apologized to me.

34:02.551 --> 34:04.647
I rescind the apology.
I take it back.

34:04.648 --> 34:05.833
She's in the fridge.

34:05.834 --> 34:08.157
You know what?
Let's just go downstairs

34:08.158 --> 34:09.827
and wait for the driver there.

34:09.828 --> 34:12.219
I am not going anywhere until
I see what's in that fridge.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.677
What?!

34:14.060 --> 34:16.462
You're gonna stay here and
wait for him to open it?

34:16.463 --> 34:17.891
If that's what it takes.

34:19.107 --> 34:20.782
Okay, fine.

34:22.201 --> 34:23.210
Where are you going?

34:23.212 --> 34:25.395
Castle, I made plans for you,

34:25.396 --> 34:26.909
I dressed up for you,

34:26.909 --> 34:28.982
and I'm not gonna let
you ruin this night.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.018
So what are you gonna do?

34:30.020 --> 34:31.543
I am going to go over there

34:31.543 --> 34:32.972
and open that bloody fridge,

34:32.973 --> 34:35.639
and then you and I
are going to dinner

34:35.641 --> 34:37.701
and never talking
about this again.

34:37.702 --> 34:39.020
No, don't do it.
It's too dangerous.

34:39.021 --> 34:41.542
Not as dangerous as me
if you blow up my plans.

34:42.638 --> 34:43.840
Well, what if he
doesn't let you in?

34:43.841 --> 34:45.922
Look at me.
He's gonna let me in.

34:46.985 --> 34:48.129
Not if there's a body in there.

34:48.130 --> 34:49.696
There's not a body in there.

35:24.935 --> 35:26.863
No, no, Beckett.

35:33.848 --> 35:34.948
No.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.305
No.

35:39.489 --> 35:40.723
Beckett! No!

35:41.859 --> 35:42.920
No!

35:53.910 --> 35:54.541
Where is she?!

35:54.542 --> 35:56.042
She's upstairs!
She's in the apartment!

35:56.812 --> 35:57.858
Wait for me!

36:00.637 --> 36:02.073
NYPD! Open up!

36:02.074 --> 36:03.192
Open up now!

36:04.279 --> 36:05.705
Kick it! Kick it! Kick it!

36:06.321 --> 36:07.577
- Beckett!
- Beckett!

36:08.065 --> 36:08.740
- Beckett!
- Beckett!

36:08.741 --> 36:10.278
- Beckett, you there?!
- Beckett!

36:10.279 --> 36:11.647
Beckett, where are you?

36:13.585 --> 36:15.370
Surprise!

36:15.998 --> 36:17.092
Happy Birthday!

36:17.093 --> 36:18.939
Whoo! Happy Birthday!

36:19.827 --> 36:21.231
Thank you.

36:30.644 --> 36:31.903
It was all fake?

36:33.447 --> 36:34.428
Nothing was real.

36:34.429 --> 36:35.626
You...

36:36.782 --> 36:38.887
You let me think I was crazy?

36:38.888 --> 36:40.969
You let me think you
were gonna die?

36:40.970 --> 36:43.590
But, Castle, you--
you were so bored

36:43.591 --> 36:45.075
over the past couple of weeks,

36:45.076 --> 36:47.881
stuck at home with
no case to solve.

36:47.882 --> 36:49.784
And I saw that this
apartment was for rent,

36:49.785 --> 36:51.429
and I just-- I thought that I--

36:51.430 --> 36:52.017
Richard--

36:52.018 --> 36:53.008
No.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.592
No.

36:56.594 --> 36:57.882
This is...

36:59.385 --> 37:00.642
without a doubt...

37:02.742 --> 37:05.800
the greatest birthday
gift of my life!

37:15.341 --> 37:16.359
How did you do it?

37:16.360 --> 37:18.260
Well, I did have a lot of help.

37:18.261 --> 37:20.128
Yes, you did, indeed.

37:20.129 --> 37:21.225
You were all in on it?

37:21.226 --> 37:23.907
Mm-hmm. Michael, Brent, Emily--

37:23.908 --> 37:25.375
my brilliant acting students.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.461
I, of course, was the director.

37:27.593 --> 37:28.470
And the boys?

37:28.471 --> 37:29.949
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. They were great.

37:29.950 --> 37:31.517
Except you didn't have
to kick down the door.

37:31.518 --> 37:32.874
I was in the moment.
We wanted to be convincing.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.889
- Yeah.
- Alexis, you, too?

37:34.890 --> 37:36.738
It's why I bought
you the binoculars.

37:36.817 --> 37:38.037
Even Captain Gates?

37:38.038 --> 37:39.353
Yeah, she jumped at the chance

37:39.354 --> 37:40.821
to dress you down
for any reason.

37:41.124 --> 37:42.381
Where is Captain Gates?

37:42.382 --> 37:43.961
- She couldn't make it.
- Good.

37:49.866 --> 37:50.786
All right!

37:59.722 --> 38:01.177
You really blew my mind.

38:01.178 --> 38:02.779
Yeah, well, I figured
the trickiest part

38:02.780 --> 38:04.758
would be fooling you and...

38:04.759 --> 38:06.052
keep a straight face.

38:06.381 --> 38:08.694
Well, you win the Oscar for

38:08.695 --> 38:10.601
best pretend murder.

38:10.694 --> 38:13.620
I cannot believe the
whole thing was staged.

38:15.494 --> 38:16.618
Staged?

38:17.084 --> 38:18.064
What?

38:18.889 --> 38:20.881
I think I just solved my case.

38:21.886 --> 38:23.401
Does that mean you're
gonna have to go run off

38:23.402 --> 38:25.030
and arrest someone?

38:25.057 --> 38:26.050
No.

38:26.118 --> 38:28.473
Right now I've got other plans.

38:31.354 --> 38:32.679
Happy birthday.

38:36.618 --> 38:38.675
Look, I'm sorry I had
to drag you down here,

38:38.676 --> 38:40.899
but I think you might
actually hold the key

38:40.900 --> 38:42.536
to solving this murder.

38:42.551 --> 38:44.381
Sure, but I already
told you what I know.

38:44.382 --> 38:46.952
Right, that you spotted the
murder being committed

38:46.953 --> 38:48.733
on surveillance, and
then you called 9-1-1.

38:48.734 --> 38:49.798
That's correct.

38:51.889 --> 38:54.488
See, I've looked at this
video dozens of times,

38:54.489 --> 38:55.994
trying to see if I
could find a clue

38:55.995 --> 38:57.479
as to who the murderer was.

38:57.480 --> 39:00.625
And then I realized, I'm
looking in the wrong place.

39:01.808 --> 39:02.947
Do you see that?

39:03.602 --> 39:04.677
See what?

39:05.764 --> 39:07.881
I-it's actually kind
of hard to spot.

39:07.882 --> 39:11.062
Um... that dot right there.

39:13.122 --> 39:15.605
It's graffiti that
somehow magically

39:15.606 --> 39:17.596
appears on that wall.

39:19.045 --> 39:20.216
Here.

39:20.334 --> 39:22.002
I'll play it for you again.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.289
How is that possible?

39:27.597 --> 39:28.608
I don't know.

39:28.609 --> 39:30.036
The only way that it's possible

39:30.037 --> 39:32.202
is if someone tampered
with the feed

39:32.203 --> 39:34.574
and replaced the live image

39:34.575 --> 39:37.705
with footage that was recorded
before that tag was made.

39:37.706 --> 39:39.340
That would be impossible
unless somebody--

39:39.341 --> 39:41.187
Had access to the
surveillance system,

39:41.188 --> 39:41.912
which you have.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.482
And if that is indeed
a prerecorded image,

39:44.483 --> 39:46.296
then that means that
the attack was faked.

39:46.297 --> 39:48.483
And that woman that
is being beaten

39:48.484 --> 39:49.931
and then thrown
into the dumpster

39:49.932 --> 39:51.946
is not the real Mrs. Dewinter.

39:51.947 --> 39:55.369
Now do you notice that she
never actually shows her face?

39:55.474 --> 39:58.267
It's almost as if someone
is pretending to be her,

39:58.268 --> 39:59.775
someone with the same frame,

39:59.776 --> 40:01.916
someone a lot like you.

40:01.917 --> 40:02.971
That is not me.

40:02.972 --> 40:04.572
I'm guessing that
the real Mrs. Dewinter

40:04.573 --> 40:06.678
was killed somewhere else
earlier in the evening,

40:06.679 --> 40:09.667
and that the killer planted
her body in the dumpster

40:09.668 --> 40:11.074
so that it would be there

40:11.075 --> 40:14.048
when you and your colleagues
viewed the faked footage.

40:14.049 --> 40:17.242
That video is the perfect
alibi for the murder.

40:17.243 --> 40:19.269
I didn't even know
Mrs. Dewinter.

40:20.857 --> 40:23.349
No, but you do know her husband.

40:24.136 --> 40:25.891
According to your
personnel file,

40:25.892 --> 40:27.128
you worked night security

40:27.129 --> 40:28.973
at a supermarket in
Queens a year ago.

40:28.974 --> 40:31.968
That is the same store
as Mr. Dewinter.

40:32.293 --> 40:33.448
That's just a coincidence.

40:33.449 --> 40:36.933
Is it also a coincidence that
you rented a CLS550 a week ago?

40:45.527 --> 40:46.795
I didn't kill her.

40:47.117 --> 40:48.196
I know you didn't.

40:49.158 --> 40:51.096
I need you to tell me who did.

40:55.235 --> 40:57.265
They met a year ago
on the late shift

40:57.266 --> 40:58.967
and started an affair.

40:59.462 --> 41:00.300
Once they got together,

41:00.301 --> 41:02.337
Gavin realized that he'd
have to get rid of his wife,

41:02.338 --> 41:04.245
and instead of a messy divorce,

41:04.705 --> 41:06.450
they decided to make a killing.

41:06.483 --> 41:07.385
Some marriage.

41:07.386 --> 41:08.843
No wonder Clara
wanted to disappear.

41:08.844 --> 41:10.678
Yeah, but she didn't
do it fast enough.

41:10.794 --> 41:12.601
So where'd the actual
murder take place?

41:12.602 --> 41:13.990
In the Dewinters' garage.

41:14.308 --> 41:16.288
After dinner, he
bludgeoned her to death

41:16.289 --> 41:17.899
with the bat that he
left in the alleyway,

41:17.900 --> 41:19.758
and then he changed
her into the clothes

41:19.759 --> 41:21.203
that Rigas wore on that tape.

41:21.385 --> 41:23.667
And then just before placing
her body in the dumpster,

41:23.668 --> 41:25.287
Rigas switched to
the dummy feed.

41:25.304 --> 41:26.374
Perfect crime.

41:26.383 --> 41:27.357
Yeah.

41:29.744 --> 41:30.895
Almost.

41:32.663 --> 41:34.239
Well, I'm glad I could
help with the case,

41:34.245 --> 41:36.218
even though it was by accident.

41:37.728 --> 41:40.821
How many murders do you think
we've solved since we met?

41:40.979 --> 41:44.389
I don't know. Um...
maybe a hundred or so.

41:44.390 --> 41:45.987
- A hundred?
- Mm-hmm.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.771
Here's to a hundred more.

41:52.830 --> 41:53.820
You know...

41:54.718 --> 41:55.651
What you...

41:55.836 --> 41:57.082
did for me...

42:00.208 --> 42:02.825
Nobody's ever done
that for me before.

42:05.418 --> 42:09.059
That was... epic!

42:11.325 --> 42:14.403
But you do know that now
I will have to get you back?

42:14.427 --> 42:16.528
Oh, really? And you think
that you can top that?

42:16.552 --> 42:18.950
Oh, just you wait
and see.
