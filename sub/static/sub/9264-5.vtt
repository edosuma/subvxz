00:00.150 --> 00:02.357
I'm still your daughter,
just as much as little blob.

00:02.653 --> 00:06.417
You don't have to be such a brat.
That's really mature.

00:06.679 --> 00:09.260
- Come back here right now.
- Dad, it's all over the paper.

00:09.420 --> 00:12.030
I'll have human resources send over
termination package tonight.

00:12.331 --> 00:15.384
- Hope you know what you're doing.
- They are embryonic stem cells.

00:15.646 --> 00:17.678
You're gonna give him
a shot from a shark?

00:17.940 --> 00:20.931
- What am I supposed to do?
- Come. Help me talk him out of it.

00:21.193 --> 00:23.809
Come to mexico?
You're outta your mind.

00:24.071 --> 00:26.402
I've got to go. They just pulled
a body out of the river.

00:26.562 --> 00:28.712
- We have no choice.
- We do have a choice.

00:29.078 --> 00:31.358
I could turn myself in.
That's what I'm gonna do.

00:31.655 --> 00:33.467
And spend the rest of your life in jail?

Jason Street, he's got wheelchair...

01:12.304 --> 01:14.013
Makin' fun of cripples now, Lyla?

01:14.839 --> 01:15.844
Nice hat.

01:17.396 --> 01:19.461
Did I miss something?
What are you doing here?

01:19.799 --> 01:21.367
Tim didn't tell you I was coming?

01:21.629 --> 01:23.648
Wait a minute. He called you here?

01:23.808 --> 01:25.746
You're the Christian Coalition?

01:25.969 --> 01:29.051
- He's worried about this procedure.
- Riggins, get your ass out here!

01:30.114 --> 01:33.550
- Do you call Lyla and tell her to come?
- You didn't tell him?

01:33.973 --> 01:35.118
You made it.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.194
My quarterback and runningback
are fighting on the field

01:39.354 --> 01:41.011
and I don't know
where the fullback is.

01:41.373 --> 01:43.553
- Frustrating.
- Frustrating.

01:44.726 --> 01:46.454
What's with the candles?

01:47.007 --> 01:48.089
Where's the baby?

01:49.685 --> 01:52.046
Out there sleeping.
Where do you think she is?

01:53.023 --> 01:54.760
How did everything go at the doctor's?

01:56.715 --> 01:59.586
Well, aren't you sweet
to ask about little ol' me.

02:00.877 --> 02:04.102
Well, she said everything's
going just great.

02:04.279 --> 02:06.487
I'm a little bit anemic,
but that's to be expected.

02:06.656 --> 02:09.154
Anemic, that means low on iron.
You need to take vitamins.

02:09.314 --> 02:11.466
As I've been doing,
but everything's real good.

02:11.733 --> 02:12.876
Thank you for asking.

02:14.253 --> 02:15.519
So did you...

02:16.242 --> 02:19.284
by chance get the...
the green light?

02:20.536 --> 02:22.250
- Green light?
- Yeah.

02:24.339 --> 02:25.400
What do you mean?

02:26.517 --> 02:27.644
Come on.

02:28.441 --> 02:31.469
When Julie... was born we got the...

02:32.237 --> 02:35.486
That's amazing that you remember
that little tidbit of information.

02:35.806 --> 02:37.538
- Of course I remember.
- Incredible.

02:37.707 --> 02:39.027
What are you thinking?

02:39.615 --> 02:41.572
I'm thinking it's been
a long time for you.

02:42.171 --> 02:44.900
I'm thinking about us
and I'm thinking about...

02:46.149 --> 02:47.380
together time.

02:48.243 --> 02:49.334
Together time.

02:50.243 --> 02:51.454
Not just for us...

02:51.623 --> 02:53.394
You know what would be really great?

02:53.554 --> 02:54.421
Yeah, I do.

02:54.581 --> 02:58.225
You and Gracie.
And you already put her out there.

02:59.476 --> 03:01.927
You go out there with her.
I can get a good night's sleep.

03:02.087 --> 03:03.971
That would be the best gift
you could give me.

03:04.140 --> 03:06.669
- I don't want to.
- It has been so long.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.120
Thank you, honey.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.872
Thank you for thinking.
Close that door behind you.

03:13.172 --> 03:15.310
- You know what?
- Love you, sweetheart.

04:19.765 --> 04:21.933
I don't know what is going on,
what's being said.

04:22.242 --> 04:24.258
All I see is Riggins
throwing dollars at the guy.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.879
There's kind of a major language
barrier there too.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.902
Anyway, that's how he ended up
spread eagle on the hood of a car.

04:30.192 --> 04:32.391
Looks like you found
a new level of dumb down here.

04:32.701 --> 04:34.810
- We're trying anyway.
- Yeah, trying to.

04:35.239 --> 04:37.704
So we're sitting there and Riggs...

04:45.836 --> 04:47.244
All right. I'll see you.

04:47.629 --> 04:48.827
Oh, sorry.

04:53.220 --> 04:54.693
So, um, how are you doing?

04:56.901 --> 04:58.701
- Good.
- That's awesome.

05:03.865 --> 05:07.229
This has to be one of the most awkward
conversations of my life.

05:07.723 --> 05:09.625
Actually, it's not as bad as last night.

05:09.785 --> 05:12.097
Grandma tryin' to explain me
where babies come from.

05:13.610 --> 05:16.582
- So what did you do about it?
- I just turned the tv on.

05:16.742 --> 05:20.307
As soon as I heard the word stork,
I just put on Law and Order.

05:20.826 --> 05:23.249
- And pretended not to hear her.
- Good thinking.

05:26.430 --> 05:29.501
Well, my friends are waiting
so I should probably go.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.247
- No.
- No what?

05:38.081 --> 05:39.449
- What?
- Just no.

05:39.609 --> 05:41.196
You know what I'm talking about.

05:41.365 --> 05:44.421
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll see you at practice.

05:49.797 --> 05:50.860
There he is!

05:51.628 --> 05:53.860
Oh, my god. Let's go!

05:57.029 --> 06:00.049
- This team trying to impress me?
- I tried to warn you, Coach.

06:00.365 --> 06:02.151
*

06:02.874 --> 06:04.367
That makes me sick.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.666
- Round 'em up.
- Bring it in on me! Come on, let's go!

06:07.950 --> 06:09.978
All right, ladies.
Here's what we're gonna do.

06:10.408 --> 06:12.992
We're gonna switch positions
for the remainder of the practice.

06:13.152 --> 06:16.161
Backs go to the line.
Offense/defense, defense/offense.

06:16.423 --> 06:19.388
Coaches, get 'em in their groups
and let's go have some fun.

06:19.676 --> 06:21.100
You got two minutes!

06:21.386 --> 06:23.251
- Two minutes to change out.
- Let's go.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.363
Big number for a little number!
It's easy.

06:50.645 --> 06:51.978
Get him!

06:55.415 --> 06:57.171
- Who's that kid?
- Who?

06:57.471 --> 07:00.159
- 43, that * looking kid.
- That's Saracen's friend.

07:00.441 --> 07:03.333
- Who, Lance?
- I believe Lndry.

07:03.986 --> 07:05.536
Landry Clarke I think.

07:06.981 --> 07:09.617
You don't gotta hit me
every time you touch the ball.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.883
I need to mix this up.
I'm not playing noseguard.

07:12.162 --> 07:15.496
- You need to get down on the line.
- I don't get on all fours for nobody.

07:15.663 --> 07:17.014
That ain't what I heard.

07:17.276 --> 07:19.153
That's just the talk
around the locker room.

07:20.904 --> 07:21.926
What you gonna do?

07:22.086 --> 07:23.768
I swear to god,
I'm telling you...

07:24.533 --> 07:25.589
Hey, get over here!

07:27.924 --> 07:28.844
You two.

07:29.004 --> 07:30.777
I want you over on the 40
with coach there.

07:31.088 --> 07:33.030
- 50 up downs.
- He's talking trash!

07:33.315 --> 07:35.009
All right, 100. 100!

07:56.123 --> 07:57.509
Everything okay?

07:58.165 --> 07:59.014
Good.

08:00.075 --> 08:01.975
Got them bags under your eyes.

08:06.648 --> 08:08.148
Have trouble at home?

08:09.477 --> 08:10.284
What?

08:10.444 --> 08:12.569
You know, a new baby
can be a son of bitch sometime.

08:13.834 --> 08:16.084
You and Tami back in the saddle yet?

08:17.066 --> 08:18.492
What the hell you talking about?

08:18.800 --> 08:21.291
I just found that
when me and Susan got...

08:22.598 --> 08:25.902
romantic again that it just kinda...
everything fell into place, you know?

08:26.908 --> 08:29.493
Tell you what I did.
Gave her a night out with the girls.

08:30.361 --> 08:32.410
Gets a night away from the baby.

08:32.815 --> 08:34.265
Has a drink or two.

08:35.129 --> 08:36.979
Comes home that night, boom.

08:38.313 --> 08:40.013
Back in the saddle again.

08:42.118 --> 08:43.100
Do me a favor.

08:45.596 --> 08:47.480
Not now or ever again,

08:49.250 --> 08:53.626
I don't want to hear about you
and Susan ridin' in the saddle.

08:54.519 --> 08:55.403
Understood.

08:55.675 --> 08:56.616
Thank you.

08:56.967 --> 08:58.962
Might want to bring
some flowers home too.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.872
It's always a nice touch.

09:01.632 --> 09:03.282
Susan likes the tulips.

09:04.007 --> 09:05.513
What did they say after that?

09:05.673 --> 09:08.645
- Did they ask you where you were?
- They just said thank you and I left.

09:10.049 --> 09:10.836
That's it?

09:11.453 --> 09:12.453
That's it.

09:15.303 --> 09:16.133
Well, okay.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.647
I am freaking out.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.768
- Don't freak out.
- Don't tell me what to do.

09:19.928 --> 09:23.485
I am freaking...
Why aren't you freaking out?

09:25.296 --> 09:27.185
You know, I guess I'm taking a break.

09:27.662 --> 09:29.922
You're taking...
You're taking a break.

09:30.734 --> 09:32.543
Look, Landry,
this could lead right to us.

09:32.703 --> 09:34.552
- You realize that?
- To me.

09:34.712 --> 09:36.508
- This was both of us.
- No, it was me.

09:36.668 --> 09:39.861
- It wasn't... It wasn't you.
- Fine, this could lead to you.

09:40.906 --> 09:42.910
You could go to jail because of me.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.115
I'm sorry.

09:54.796 --> 09:56.762
Hey Chad, hearing good things
about the boy.

09:56.922 --> 09:58.926
We'll be seeing him
under the lights before long.

09:59.086 --> 10:01.857
- Yeah, he's doing okay.
- We'll be watching.

10:02.017 --> 10:05.178
- I appreciate you mentioning that.
- Open container violation.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.692
Shoplifting, dropped.
Shoplifting, no contest.

10:07.852 --> 10:09.352
Another open container again.

10:09.648 --> 10:11.847
Truancy, indecent exposure,
public drunkenness...

10:12.297 --> 10:14.532
we have found ourselves
a real upstanding citizen.

10:14.738 --> 10:16.568
Got a real rep
in the sex department too.

10:16.830 --> 10:18.605
Got a sister who's a stripper.

10:18.765 --> 10:20.770
- What are you guys talking about?
- Hey, troop.

10:22.710 --> 10:23.617
What'd she do?

10:23.903 --> 10:26.229
Eight months back our murder Vic
tried to rape her.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.622
So you pulled her report.
Is she a suspect?

10:30.326 --> 10:32.449
She's definitely a person of interest.

10:35.252 --> 10:37.684
- Here's that information...
- Thanks, appreciate that.

10:45.976 --> 10:47.849
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

10:48.111 --> 10:49.523
What do you mean?

10:49.683 --> 10:51.529
- I'm just... I'm going.
- Why?

10:51.689 --> 10:54.606
- You just think this is a big joke.
- I don't think it is.

10:54.868 --> 10:57.225
All you've done is go
to whore houses and karaoke bars.

10:57.393 --> 10:59.918
Yeah, well what else
did you do you do in Mexico, Garrity?

11:00.199 --> 11:01.199
You're an idiot.

11:01.697 --> 11:03.439
You think this is easy for me?

11:03.599 --> 11:06.034
You call me down here to help
and Jason didn't even know.

11:06.337 --> 11:09.093
- You have no plan whatsoever.
- As a matter of fact I do.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.674
- Oh, really? What's your plan, Tim?
- It's right here.

11:12.860 --> 11:15.547
A booze cruise?
This is your plan?

11:15.707 --> 11:18.983
All inclusive, meals, snorkeling,
dolphins. Yeah, a booze cruise.

11:19.327 --> 11:21.818
I thought it would be a good time
to chat him up on the boat.

11:22.669 --> 11:25.040
You think the way to have
a conversation with someone

11:25.200 --> 11:27.289
who's about to make
the biggest mistake in his life

11:27.449 --> 11:30.350
- is by taking him on a booze cruise?
- Yeah, kinda sorta.

11:32.801 --> 11:33.801
What?

11:36.062 --> 11:37.956
I don't even know
where to begin to tell you

11:38.116 --> 11:39.909
how distorted your view of the world is.

11:40.069 --> 11:42.003
I'm distorted?
My view's distorted?

11:42.163 --> 11:43.163
Really?

11:43.382 --> 11:44.753
- I disagree.
- Yeah, really.

11:45.043 --> 11:46.518
- I'm not the one...
- Really?

11:46.798 --> 11:48.743
I may be as screwed up as you say I am.

11:49.005 --> 11:50.555
And that's fine. Go with that.

11:50.715 --> 11:52.496
But at least I'm by J's side.

11:52.656 --> 11:55.663
At least I'm going through whatever
it is we're gonna go through together.

11:56.156 --> 11:58.574
I will take him back in a box
to Texas if I have to, Lyla.

11:58.811 --> 11:59.570
You?

11:59.846 --> 12:02.979
The second you saw us you were ready
to get on that next plane back to Texas.

12:03.214 --> 12:06.050
That kinda sucks for J and for me.

12:08.793 --> 12:11.975
You know what? You know I'm right.
You just won't admit it.

12:12.425 --> 12:14.769
I sin daily and I'm a better christian
than you, Garrity.

12:28.152 --> 12:29.025
Fine.

12:29.924 --> 12:31.870
I'll go on your stupid booze cruise.

12:32.481 --> 12:34.709
Better man up
and have a conversation with me.

12:36.773 --> 12:39.335
This is an intervention, Tim,
and I can't do this by myself.

12:40.830 --> 12:42.182
- Here.
- I got it!

12:44.295 --> 12:47.008
I need some extra cash too
for that booze cruise.

12:51.485 --> 12:52.937
I smell bacon.

12:55.396 --> 12:56.396
She's sleeping.

12:56.893 --> 13:00.730
You did all the wake ups last night
and you're cooking breakfast?

13:01.603 --> 13:03.193
And you got tulips?

13:03.503 --> 13:04.903
You know what I am?

13:05.198 --> 13:07.548
I'm a husband taking care of his wife.

13:07.918 --> 13:09.179
What's wrong with that?

13:09.461 --> 13:11.991
I don't think anything's wrong.
I just don't know who you are.

13:12.151 --> 13:13.667
What have you done with my husband?

13:13.827 --> 13:15.413
- Here, here's some...
- Thank you.

13:15.675 --> 13:16.686
You're welcome.

13:17.634 --> 13:19.918
- I tell you what.
- What?

13:20.180 --> 13:21.923
Gonna be some changes around here.

13:22.238 --> 13:23.609
What kind of changes?

13:23.777 --> 13:27.417
You want to know what kind of changes?
What day is today?

13:27.974 --> 13:30.570
It's wednesday.
And what happens wednesday nights?

13:30.730 --> 13:33.079
I would know that because
of this new chart I've created.

13:33.239 --> 13:34.578
Let's see, wednesday.

13:34.738 --> 13:36.851
Oh, gee, there's book club tonight.

13:37.267 --> 13:38.936
No, I don't want to go to book club.

13:39.096 --> 13:41.214
- Yes, you do wanna go.
- Those ladies are crazy.

13:41.374 --> 13:43.810
You are going to book club.
Let me tell you why,

13:44.684 --> 13:46.016
you're gonna relax.

13:46.176 --> 13:48.044
Gonna spend some time
with your friends.

13:48.204 --> 13:50.274
Gonna have a few glasses of wine.

13:50.434 --> 13:52.402
And you're gonna enjoy yourself.
That's why.

13:53.289 --> 13:54.289
All right?

13:58.445 --> 14:00.395
A man takes care of his wife.

14:05.308 --> 14:07.802
You are really starting
to get this whole trigonometry thing.

14:07.962 --> 14:10.493
I am so excited to get out in
the world and use some of this.

14:10.653 --> 14:12.745
'Cause I'm sure it's gonna
come in handy some time.

14:12.905 --> 14:15.514
Don't sell yourself short.
You don't know what's gonna happen.

14:15.674 --> 14:18.257
You may wake up and want to
be a structural engineer.

14:18.475 --> 14:22.420
You're right. As soon as I quit
waitressing, that's what I plan to do.

14:22.598 --> 14:23.884
That's what I thought.

14:26.420 --> 14:27.227
Okay.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.659
- Bye.
- See ya.

14:47.169 --> 14:49.180
- Hey, dad.
- Landry.

14:49.832 --> 14:52.281
- How you doing?
- I'm pretty good.

14:52.443 --> 14:55.036
- How was practice today?
- Okay.

14:56.037 --> 14:57.987
I made a tackle today, but...

14:58.464 --> 15:01.644
You and Tyra sure seem to be spending
a lot of time together here lately.

15:03.051 --> 15:04.984
Yeah. I guess.

15:05.153 --> 15:07.567
I was talking about her
with some of the detectives.

15:09.918 --> 15:10.904
Really?

15:11.914 --> 15:14.064
I need to ask you something...

15:15.090 --> 15:18.343
how come you didn't bother to tell me
that the guy we pulled out of the river

15:18.573 --> 15:20.455
was the same one that tried to rape her?

15:22.525 --> 15:23.374
You serious?

15:24.995 --> 15:26.881
Well, you do know
she was down at the station.

15:27.084 --> 15:28.834
You know that, don't you?

15:32.343 --> 15:33.693
No, I didn't know.

15:34.747 --> 15:36.740
You're spending a lot of time
with each other.

15:36.900 --> 15:40.597
I just... The whole thing didn't make
sense to me, to be honest with you.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.352
She just really doesn't
want to talk about it.

15:43.512 --> 15:45.929
There's nothing else
that I can say is that she...

15:46.089 --> 15:48.409
- she's not saying it.
- Okay, I understand that.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.681
I'm just saying that ordinarily,
in situations like this,

15:52.155 --> 15:54.765
people want somebody
that they can talk to.

15:54.925 --> 15:56.027
That may be the case.

15:56.187 --> 15:59.338
- You're right about that...
- It's a lot to carry alone, Landry!

16:04.852 --> 16:06.960
What is it that you want me to say?

16:14.297 --> 16:16.886
I don't...
I don't know anything.

16:22.472 --> 16:24.218
Come on, I want to hear it.
What's wrong?

16:24.378 --> 16:25.628
What's going on?

16:26.503 --> 16:28.634
I didn't have you over
just to eat my chili.

16:28.963 --> 16:31.109
I want to know
what the hell is going on.

16:31.630 --> 16:32.484
Nothing.

16:35.465 --> 16:36.281
Nothing?

16:39.133 --> 16:40.438
Yeah, nothing really.

16:46.794 --> 16:48.544
Right here at this table.

16:49.105 --> 16:50.622
I want it on the table.

16:50.782 --> 16:52.046
We're gonna air this out.

16:57.172 --> 17:00.221
I'm tired of Smash acting
like he cares about the team at all.

17:00.483 --> 17:02.782
- I care about the team.
- No, you don't care.

17:02.942 --> 17:05.510
You care about using the team
to get your free ride to college.

17:05.772 --> 17:09.326
I worked years to get to this place.
You only been starting one season.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.503
You're mad 'cause
you can't call the coin toss.

17:11.703 --> 17:13.752
Everyone knows the C on my arm
don't mean a thing.

17:13.913 --> 17:15.671
You're the one who keeps bringing it up.

17:15.830 --> 17:18.478
If you want to lead, get to it.
Quit whining like a little bi-ch.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.385
Watch your mouth.
What the hell do you think you're doing?

17:22.722 --> 17:25.163
- He's doing the same thing you did.
- I'm sorry.

17:25.454 --> 17:27.766
How you just used us as a stepping stone
to get to TMU.

17:27.925 --> 17:31.002
When that didn't work out you came
back thinking we'd be happy to have you.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.148
Kind of like what your daughter do
with the Polish Swedish kid,

17:34.308 --> 17:35.642
whatever the hell he is.

17:39.815 --> 17:42.736
- See what've been dealing with all...
- Close the door on the way out.

17:56.304 --> 18:00.111
Look at my hair, look at my dog,
look at my scooter.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.825
- Hi, honey.
- How are you doing?

18:03.177 --> 18:04.118
How are you?

18:04.818 --> 18:05.694
Good.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.840
- How was the book club meeting?
- It was really, really good.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.672
It was so nice to get out.

18:10.832 --> 18:13.084
It was nice to have
some conversation with some people.

18:13.285 --> 18:14.837
- Good.
- Very good, thank you.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.188
How was dinner?

18:16.348 --> 18:17.698
Dinner was...

18:19.364 --> 18:21.739
Dinner was pretty much a flop.

18:21.899 --> 18:23.505
Oh, no!

18:23.860 --> 18:25.390
Nothing your chili couldn't fix?

18:25.769 --> 18:26.641
No, no.

18:27.371 --> 18:28.721
Oh, that is awful.

18:29.690 --> 18:32.027
- You had a good time, didn't you?
- I did.

18:32.187 --> 18:35.032
- You look very relaxed.
- It was very, very relaxing.

18:36.172 --> 18:36.984
Was it?

18:37.824 --> 18:40.697
- What are you laughing at?
- You know what's funny?

18:40.989 --> 18:44.029
Every single girl at that party
had a six-week story.

18:45.704 --> 18:46.662
What's that?

18:47.160 --> 18:50.650
It's the story of their husbands
wanting to have sex

18:50.810 --> 18:53.459
before they were ready to have sex
after they had a baby.

18:54.548 --> 18:55.712
Isn't that funny?

18:56.172 --> 18:57.862
You know what those people are?

18:58.719 --> 18:59.674
Those are bad,

19:00.907 --> 19:01.718
dirty...

19:02.531 --> 19:06.110
Honey! My boobs are killing me.
It's like concrete.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.004
I gotta go pump and dump, baby.
I'm sorry.

19:08.164 --> 19:10.081
I love you. Don't touch me.
Love you.

19:29.306 --> 19:31.109
Hey, how are you?

19:31.522 --> 19:33.334
I'm good.
How are you doing?

19:34.386 --> 19:35.156
Good.

19:37.796 --> 19:40.346
So, I was wondering
I have an extra ticket

19:40.550 --> 19:43.100
to the decemberists
and I thought maybe...

19:44.605 --> 19:45.605
Oh, yeah.

19:45.770 --> 19:48.014
I mean it's not a date or anything.

19:48.399 --> 19:51.619
No, it's just the decemberists.

19:51.946 --> 19:52.737
Yeah.

19:53.448 --> 19:56.105
I just thought it would be fun
and I miss hanging out with you.

19:58.283 --> 20:00.151
Yeah, well...
No, that's good.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.434
I'll give you a call.

20:03.889 --> 20:05.298
- Okay.
- Gimme a call.

20:06.202 --> 20:08.462
Yeah, I'll talk to you when you call me.

20:14.460 --> 20:15.354
Lance!

20:18.514 --> 20:19.495
You mean Landry?

20:20.083 --> 20:21.031
Come here.

20:22.553 --> 20:23.492
Come here.

20:26.064 --> 20:26.919
Yes, sir?

20:28.739 --> 20:31.485
If I put you in the game friday night
how would you be with that?

20:35.781 --> 20:38.597
- You'd be ready?
- Yes, sir. I'm ready right now.

20:39.773 --> 20:40.872
Well, that's it.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.439
All right.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.160
You can go now.

21:09.151 --> 21:12.354
- Hi, Mr. Clarke.
- Hi, Tyra. How are you today?

21:12.514 --> 21:13.946
I'm good. How are you?

21:14.106 --> 21:15.928
Good. You mind
if I come in for a minute?

21:17.458 --> 21:19.816
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.
- Thank you.

21:22.484 --> 21:25.161
- Can I get you a water or something?
- No, thank you.

21:25.714 --> 21:27.207
... He's all hands.

21:30.649 --> 21:35.109
- Why is there a cop in my living room?
- This is Landry's father, Mr. Clarke.

21:35.315 --> 21:37.099
- Afternoon.
- Hey.

21:37.926 --> 21:39.598
Go put some clothes on.

21:40.972 --> 21:43.686
- Did you want to have a seat?
- I don't need to sit, Tyra.

21:43.846 --> 21:47.235
This is gonna be, uh,
pretty cut and dry.

21:47.712 --> 21:50.272
This whole you
and Landry thing has never...

21:51.119 --> 21:54.828
made much sense to me, but I think
maybe it's starting to right now.

21:57.457 --> 22:00.000
I don't really know
what you're talking about.

22:00.879 --> 22:04.310
The fact that you two
just happened to get together

22:04.483 --> 22:07.746
about the same time
this dead guy shows up.

22:08.043 --> 22:10.031
That's what I'm talking about, Tyra.

22:12.449 --> 22:14.644
I'm sorry but are you
accusing me of something?

22:14.804 --> 22:16.610
I'm not here today as a cop.

22:17.013 --> 22:19.311
And God forbid it'll never come to that.

22:19.471 --> 22:23.445
I'm here talking to you as a father
who is worried about his son.

22:24.780 --> 22:27.695
Landry has never lied to me.
Never.

22:28.528 --> 22:30.092
But he's lying to me now.

22:31.284 --> 22:32.284
About you.

22:33.559 --> 22:35.699
I don't know what you're involved with

22:35.985 --> 22:38.650
but I am not about
to let him get dragged into it.

22:40.005 --> 22:42.321
I hope I'm wrong.
I really do.

22:42.490 --> 22:45.176
But either way,
you're gonna do something for me.

22:46.116 --> 22:47.866
And this is not a request.

22:48.913 --> 22:50.613
You stay away from by boy.

22:53.625 --> 22:54.625
You got that?

23:00.575 --> 23:02.026
Here you go, Mrs. Taylor.

23:02.186 --> 23:03.834
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:04.102 --> 23:06.035
- Thank you so much.
- So that's Gracie then.

23:06.373 --> 23:07.838
This is Gracie bell.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.209
- Just about to fall asleep.
- She's cute.

23:10.450 --> 23:11.968
Does she do anything yet?

23:12.234 --> 23:15.294
Mostly just a baby,
but she's pretty cute. We'll keep her.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.910
Did julie tell you
that we're hanging out this weekend?

23:18.467 --> 23:20.017
That's... I did hear about that.

23:20.279 --> 23:22.304
- That should be fun.
- That should be great.

23:22.464 --> 23:24.475
That should be good.
Thank you so much.

23:25.076 --> 23:28.126
You don't think, like, I'm a chump,
do you, for going out with her again?

23:28.286 --> 23:30.817
Or hanging out with her again.
Landry keeps saying I'm a chump

23:30.977 --> 23:33.897
and I should've just said
"No, I won't hang out with you again."

23:37.416 --> 23:40.169
You know, it doesn't matter.
I mean, it's important what you think.

23:40.329 --> 23:43.346
- I think that's the important thing.
- Right, I think that I miss her.

23:43.506 --> 23:46.635
I mean, I know I miss her.
Just, you know, after, you know.

23:51.103 --> 23:54.283
Well, it's an awkward position
for me to...

23:54.940 --> 23:57.511
But I think you have...

23:59.806 --> 24:02.968
Listen, I just think the most important
thing in a relationship is trust.

24:03.128 --> 24:03.978
That's...

24:04.617 --> 24:07.787
- That's true.
- Pretty much most important thing.

24:08.327 --> 24:10.929
Yeah, well thanks.
You probably gotta go to your car.

24:11.148 --> 24:12.695
Do you need a hand?

24:27.299 --> 24:28.520
Jacques Cousteau.

24:30.689 --> 24:31.824
Not funny?

24:38.996 --> 24:40.113
So this is it, huh?

24:42.448 --> 24:46.379
We've been talking. We don't think this
stem cell thing's such a great idea.

24:46.746 --> 24:49.815
Look, I know you feel lost and you're
looking for hope but it's false hope.

24:50.456 --> 24:52.568
Why are you here?
Why is she even here?

24:53.581 --> 24:55.444
We don't want you
to do this on a whim.

24:55.708 --> 24:58.238
- I've been researching it for weeks...
- Weeks?

24:58.541 --> 25:01.743
Come on, even the doctor said there's
a good chance of dying on the table.

25:02.048 --> 25:03.861
I want out of this chair, all right?

25:04.380 --> 25:06.391
I want out of this chair.
Not next month,

25:06.607 --> 25:10.169
not next year, but I want out now!
All right, this is a way to do that.

25:10.431 --> 25:11.858
You can't look me in the eye

25:12.140 --> 25:15.079
and tell me what it's like to live
in this chair. So I'm gonna do this.

25:15.239 --> 25:16.382
Y'all can't stop me.

25:16.542 --> 25:18.636
Get on the table.
If I die, I'm fine with that.

25:18.899 --> 25:20.551
No. You have so much to live for.

25:20.816 --> 25:22.890
- Actually I don't, Lyla.
- Yes, you do, Jason.

25:23.234 --> 25:26.362
I know it doesn't seem like it right now
but everything happens for a reason.

25:26.561 --> 25:27.645
God has a plan.

25:28.248 --> 25:30.147
- No God card.
- What?

25:30.418 --> 25:32.790
God and I aren't exactly friends
since He breaked my neck.

25:32.995 --> 25:34.273
You don't want religion.

25:34.433 --> 25:37.490
How about the fact that this is
a stupid idea and you're being an idiot.

25:40.486 --> 25:43.138
Maybe I'll just let some Jesus freak
dunk my head under the water

25:43.298 --> 25:44.989
and wash all my troubles away.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.774
It's that easy, right?
Or maybe I'll just grab a twelver.

25:49.075 --> 25:51.094
Right, Riggins?
That'll fix my spine right up.

25:51.254 --> 25:53.906
Maybe I could sleep with the single
woman from across the street.

25:54.066 --> 25:55.533
You know what? I get it, J.

25:55.693 --> 25:57.754
I get you want to walk again
but guess what?

25:57.914 --> 26:00.262
Never gonna happen.
Ever. Fact.

26:00.713 --> 26:02.497
Best case scenario, you lose ten grand.

26:02.779 --> 26:05.258
Worst case scenario, dead, J.

26:05.429 --> 26:08.030
I don't want to go back to Dillon
look your family in the eyes

26:08.190 --> 26:09.917
and tell 'em I let you do this?

26:11.241 --> 26:12.049
Listen,

26:12.528 --> 26:13.664
I love you.

26:14.238 --> 26:17.894
And I will knock you out and bring
your ass back to Dillon if I have to.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.100
Okay?

27:02.959 --> 27:04.655
Hey, he's gone!

27:06.345 --> 27:07.745
Hey, turn the boat around!

27:08.383 --> 27:09.413
Turn it around!

27:12.347 --> 27:13.587
I can't see him!

28:39.094 --> 28:40.744
What were you thinking?

28:42.149 --> 28:43.149
I wasn't.

28:45.447 --> 28:46.447
I'm sorry.

28:51.808 --> 28:53.658
I'm not having the surgery.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.106
Let's go back to Texas.

28:59.687 --> 29:01.420
Let's go back to Texas.

29:02.137 --> 29:03.292
Let's get you up.

29:05.754 --> 29:07.069
What are you waiting for?

29:07.229 --> 29:10.358
I'm just contemplating how I'm gonna
get you in the truck at this point.

29:10.787 --> 29:13.604
<i>It's friday night, folks,
and what a glorious evening it is.</i>

29:14.293 --> 29:17.207
<i>The once beloved,
now controversial coach Taylor</i>

29:17.590 --> 29:19.187
<i>is back in the driver's seat.</i>

29:19.358 --> 29:22.910
<i>On your feet or on your knees,
here come the Dillon Panthers.</i>

29:23.114 --> 29:25.880
We beat teams like this
on the way to the game, okay?

29:26.040 --> 29:28.093
They ain't got nothing.
Y'all better get ready.

29:28.522 --> 29:31.557
<i>Here we go. The second coming
of coach Taylor has begun.</i>

29:31.717 --> 29:33.643
<i>The Panthers take it
in their own end zone.</i>

29:33.878 --> 29:36.909
<i>He's up for the twenty, got some room
in the outside, pickes up a block</i>

29:37.197 --> 29:39.681
<i>and he's out of bounds
on the boardings. Good start.</i>

29:39.970 --> 29:42.775
You two are sitting on the bench.
Weston, Brooks, come here!

29:43.287 --> 29:46.174
<i>Folks, look here.
Brett Weston starts at quarterback.</i>

29:46.498 --> 29:48.519
<i>The tailback will be Calvin Brooks.</i>

29:48.834 --> 29:51.915
<i>That means that the hottest duo
in texas high school football last year,</i>

29:52.212 --> 29:55.098
<i>Matt Saracen and Smash Williams
are riding the bench.</i>

29:55.507 --> 29:58.486
<i>And that's a coach's decision
from Taylor that nobody saw coming.</i>

29:58.694 --> 30:02.703
<i>He's sending a clear message to
his team, it is his way or the highway.</i>

30:07.301 --> 30:10.254
<i>He's got a man open on the right.
He fires!</i>

30:10.570 --> 30:12.871
<i>Holy cow, was that off!</i>

30:13.729 --> 30:15.879
<i>Weston hands off to Brooks.
He's got a little lane.</i>

30:16.039 --> 30:18.396
<i>Picks up up the inside.
He's hit hard. Fumble.</i>

30:18.565 --> 30:21.721
<i>And Westerby has got
the second play of the game</i>

30:21.881 --> 30:23.816
<i>and Dillon's coughed it up.</i>

30:24.119 --> 30:25.893
- This is all your fault.
- Explain that.

30:26.053 --> 30:29.321
This is all your fault 'cause you dis...
We went to the coach's house...

30:29.750 --> 30:32.366
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you two just shut up?

30:32.628 --> 30:33.931
You understand me? Shut up!

30:35.919 --> 30:37.314
<i>Weston opens left.</i>

30:37.474 --> 30:40.213
<i>He's looking down field.
He fires!</i>

30:40.833 --> 30:41.932
<i>Interception.</i>

30:45.336 --> 30:47.937
<i>Touchdown and the Panthers
are shot down at the half.</i>

30:48.204 --> 30:50.401
<i>With Smash and Saracen benched,
you gotta wonder</i>

30:50.561 --> 30:53.510
<i>is coach Taylor cutting off
his nose to spite his face.</i>

30:54.035 --> 30:56.258
Out of all of you,
who's got something to say?

30:56.418 --> 30:58.183
Someone better have something to say!

31:02.198 --> 31:04.398
- Coach, Saracen and Smash...
- Sit down.

31:04.660 --> 31:08.130
Saracen and smash don't play defense.
They don't play special teams.

31:08.622 --> 31:11.062
And last time I checked,
Saracen and Smash

31:11.974 --> 31:13.505
were supposed to be...

31:14.298 --> 31:17.326
supposed to be two members
of an 11-man offense!

31:24.226 --> 31:26.209
Who's got something to say?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.432
Maybe the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts.

31:30.728 --> 31:32.676
- Landry, don't...
- Keep it shut, Saracen.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.165
- What did you say?
- I mean maybe...

31:38.075 --> 31:38.911
Speak up!

31:39.194 --> 31:42.060
We're a lot stronger together
than we're ever gonna be alone.

31:44.799 --> 31:46.528
I realize that I'm not...

31:47.044 --> 31:49.902
anywhere close to one of the most
talented players in this room.

31:50.207 --> 31:51.447
And I know...

31:52.395 --> 31:54.968
I've never played
one real down of football,

31:55.485 --> 31:58.733
but I know
that we can either win together

31:59.081 --> 32:00.264
or we can lose alone.

32:04.388 --> 32:06.224
And I know it sounds stupid,

32:06.384 --> 32:08.895
but it is an honor
just to stand in here with y'all.

32:12.923 --> 32:13.825
That's it.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.210
- Clear eyes, full hearts...
- Can't lose!

32:27.370 --> 32:29.201
Let's play some football then!

32:35.244 --> 32:38.643
<i>Hand-off to Ellis,
he's got a little gap.</i>

32:40.221 --> 32:42.229
<i>And he's blocked down by two Panthers,</i>

32:42.511 --> 32:44.952
<i>as they show new life here
in the second half.</i>

32:45.500 --> 32:47.237
- Bring Lance up here.
- You mean Landry?

32:47.509 --> 32:50.337
- Bring Lance up here.
- 85, let's go see coach.

32:50.599 --> 32:52.951
- Right up here.
- He cannot do it like that.

32:55.495 --> 32:56.697
There you go, baby!

32:57.336 --> 32:58.878
You're going in next series.

32:59.733 --> 33:02.277
Get your helmet on.
You're going in next series. You ready?

33:02.820 --> 33:06.066
You ready? Where's your helmet?
Get your helmet.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.503
- Matt, I'm going in.
- You... When?

33:10.055 --> 33:10.919
Right now.

33:11.342 --> 33:14.278
You're going in now?
Wait, this game ain't over yet.

33:15.467 --> 33:16.697
He's going in?

33:17.639 --> 33:19.770
<i>Number 85, Landry Clarke.</i>

33:19.939 --> 33:22.710
<i>Coming in to do
a little slobber-knocking at tight end.</i>

33:23.393 --> 33:24.954
<i>Weston's back to pass.</i>

33:26.222 --> 33:27.959
<i>Looking right, he fires.</i>

33:29.827 --> 33:32.029
<i>That's another pick.
That's two for tonight.</i>

33:32.189 --> 33:34.133
<i>Westerby's going the otherway.</i>

33:34.359 --> 33:36.405
<i>He's got a lane to the outside.</i>

33:36.772 --> 33:39.277
<i>Oh, big hit by number 85.</i>

33:39.775 --> 33:41.249
<i>Brooks picks up the loose ball.</i>

33:43.969 --> 33:45.406
<i>He's to the 40.</i>

33:46.908 --> 33:48.458
<i>He's inside the 30!</i>

33:48.857 --> 33:50.647
<i>Touchdown, dillon!</i>

33:50.933 --> 33:53.778
<i>That was set up with a tremendous hit</i>

33:54.162 --> 33:56.514
<i>by Landry Clarke to jar that ball loose</i>

33:56.874 --> 33:58.920
<i>and the Panthers are back in this game.</i>

33:59.209 --> 34:01.849
Who's gonna want it more?

34:02.165 --> 34:04.146
We gotta do something.
We gotta win this game.

34:04.482 --> 34:08.063
I guess we could start cheering louder.
Maybe start doing this dance.

34:08.306 --> 34:11.418
We gotta show coach we put this
all behind us and that we're cool again.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.751
You just want to tell him that we kissed
and made up and now we're good?

34:16.681 --> 34:18.831
I shouldn't have rubbed it
in your face like that.

34:20.310 --> 34:22.094
But I want back in this game!

34:22.621 --> 34:23.931
Are you with me?

34:26.824 --> 34:27.824
Yeah, man.

34:28.870 --> 34:29.819
Let's do it.

34:30.367 --> 34:31.907
All right, on-side left!

34:33.601 --> 34:37.141
- Hey, Coach, we put it away. We cool.
- BFF's once again.

34:40.708 --> 34:41.804
Go warm up.

34:42.350 --> 34:44.159
<i>17 seconds left in the game.</i>

34:44.320 --> 34:47.860
<i>Down by 5 and the Panthers
are gonna have to try an onside kick.</i>

34:49.103 --> 34:50.192
<i>And there it is.</i>

34:51.563 --> 34:53.293
<i>Westerby's got it... Big hit!</i>

34:53.585 --> 34:55.068
<i>Fumble. Ball is loose.</i>

34:55.802 --> 34:57.225
<i>And the Panthers pick it up.</i>

34:57.726 --> 35:01.952
<i>And Owens goes up down
and is lock down at the 18-yard line.</i>

35:02.727 --> 35:07.087
<i>Four seconds left in this contest.
One more chance for the Dillon Panthers.</i>

35:07.247 --> 35:10.031
<i>Coach Taylor is sending in the big guns.</i>

35:10.339 --> 35:12.667
<i>This ball has got to be going
to Smash Williams, folks.</i>

35:13.119 --> 35:15.868
<i>Fresh legs, ready to play,
this should be something!</i>

35:16.161 --> 35:17.172
Listen up.

35:17.332 --> 35:19.736
We're going
I-right storm rider Z streak.

35:19.998 --> 35:22.985
- Landry's Z, that's the call?
- Yeah, that's the call.

35:24.338 --> 35:25.338
You good?

35:25.984 --> 35:26.944
I'm ready.

35:27.104 --> 35:29.029
- Come on, let's get it on!
- On one, ready?

35:29.299 --> 35:30.295
Break.

35:35.931 --> 35:39.217
<i>Here we go, this is the last chance
for the Panthers.</i>

35:39.762 --> 35:41.446
<i>Saracen drops back to pass.</i>

35:41.946 --> 35:44.731
<i>He's got Landry open.
He fires the ball across the middle.</i>

35:45.623 --> 35:47.431
<i>Landry gets hit, the ball goes down!</i>

35:47.744 --> 35:49.321
<i>And that is it.</i>

35:49.611 --> 35:52.929
<i>The Dillon Panthers have lost
to the Westerby Chaps.</i>

35:53.110 --> 35:57.139
<i>Coach Taylor's first game back
does not end very well. Hold on.</i>

35:57.683 --> 36:00.021
Pass interference. On the defense.

36:00.713 --> 36:03.417
The ball on the 2-yard line.
We got one on-time down.

36:03.914 --> 36:06.941
<i>You cannot end a game
on a defensive penalty, folks.</i>

36:07.421 --> 36:10.104
<i>The Panthers are gonna have
one more crack at the end zone.</i>

36:12.598 --> 36:14.636
<i>Here's a hand-off to Williams.</i>

36:14.796 --> 36:17.111
- <i>He's up and over!</i>
- He's in! He's in!

36:17.389 --> 36:20.881
<i>Touchdown, Smash Williams!
The Panthers have done it!</i>

36:21.143 --> 36:24.766
<i>The Panthers have done it, 20 to 19.</i>

36:25.003 --> 36:26.605
Taylor ball is back

36:27.140 --> 36:30.577
lead by a fantastic effort
from Landry clarke.

36:30.861 --> 36:34.995
He stepped up, he sparked
this Panther team, and they have won it!

36:43.673 --> 36:44.950
Welcome on the team.

36:45.992 --> 36:47.007
Thanks, Coach.

36:56.433 --> 36:57.728
My baby boy!

37:11.757 --> 37:13.588
- This is weird, man!
- Fit in.

37:31.154 --> 37:34.120
- They're not stopping.
- You deserve it.

37:35.453 --> 37:38.148
Probably been more amazing
if I would've actually caught the ball.

37:39.612 --> 37:42.101
But I guess I'll take what I can get.

37:46.154 --> 37:47.905
- Okay?
- Yeah, no...

37:52.562 --> 37:54.608
I don't think
we should be together anymore.

38:01.190 --> 38:03.087
Okay, and why is that?

38:04.537 --> 38:07.176
- People are talking.
- That doesn't mean...

38:07.505 --> 38:09.392
Look, I'm just trying to protect you.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.737
Don't just jump to a conclusion.

38:14.906 --> 38:17.163
We need to sit down
and talk about this away from here.

38:17.450 --> 38:19.259
Do you think if "that" hadn't happened,

38:19.419 --> 38:22.185
that there would be a chance in hell
that we'd have gotten together?

38:23.819 --> 38:26.276
Do you actually think that
in a million years?

38:29.732 --> 38:33.000
Just take a look in a mirror.
I don't know what I was thinking.

38:39.188 --> 38:41.949
This is... This is over.

39:05.116 --> 39:06.914
<i>I was thinking maybe before the concert,</i>

39:07.196 --> 39:09.499
we can get a bit to eat.
Grab some pizza or something.

39:09.659 --> 39:12.203
Yeah, look, I don't think
that I can go to the concert.

39:12.524 --> 39:14.778
Panthers, baby! Yeah!

39:17.164 --> 39:18.934
Why can't you go to the concert?

39:19.520 --> 39:21.311
Because I'm pissed off at you.

39:22.717 --> 39:24.419
You cheated on me with the Swede

39:24.579 --> 39:26.633
and you wouldn't tell me
until I pushed you.

39:26.912 --> 39:29.868
And then when that didn't seem
to work out, you came back to me as if,

39:30.046 --> 39:32.563
that would just be okay.
And you never said you were sorry.

39:33.295 --> 39:34.272
I am sorry.

39:34.619 --> 39:36.704
That might've worked a couple weeks ago.

39:38.421 --> 39:41.282
I'm sure you'll find someone else
to go to the concert with you.

40:13.940 --> 40:17.966
Motel's just up here, but I'm thinking,
I'm thinking we get a drink first.

40:18.755 --> 40:21.130
Unless of course
that's against your religion, Garrity.

40:22.025 --> 40:23.123
That's funny, Tim.

41:27.952 --> 41:29.327
I gotta go pray.

42:04.820 --> 42:06.106
Good game, honey.

42:22.199 --> 42:23.307
Wanna fool around?

42:26.088 --> 42:27.088
Do you?

42:29.279 --> 42:30.124
Yeah.

42:30.605 --> 42:33.215
I don't sense true commitment
from that answer.

42:33.422 --> 42:34.699
No, I'd like to.

42:36.285 --> 42:37.298
It would be nice.

42:39.859 --> 42:40.859
Seriously?
