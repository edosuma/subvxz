04:14.796 --> 04:18.007

Uh-huh.

I've been serving in this uniform

04:28.643 --> 04:32.814
Yeah, well, you haven't booked
a narcotics offense in over a year.

04:32.898 --> 04:36.276
In fact, all you have done
is push your weight around.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.664
That depends.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.040
Uh, just one.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.123
Just one?

05:33.792 --> 05:36.002
'Cause you said "rooms," plural.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.257
- Yeah, it's just me, so just one room.
- Oh.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.883
One singular room.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.303
We take cash and credit card,

05:56.314 --> 05:57.314

05:58.817 --> 06:01.319
Mind if I just get the room, man?
It's been a long drive.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.530
Yeah. Tuckered out?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.081
Declined. This card is no good.

Oh. Telling me to call, whatnot.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.086
Oh, that's all right. I'll pay cash.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.796
Yeah, I still gotta call.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.050

You don't wanna sit on hold forever.

in Cincinnati named Suzy, right?

10:47.939 --> 10:49.232
She did this move, right?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.359
Where she gripped the pole
with both legs.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.737
She was twerking at the top of the pole
and she just dropped down.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.615
We thought she had to go to the hospital,
but she was fine.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.201
- That's what she does every night.
- Don't look!

11:00.285 --> 11:02.120

11:14.424 --> 11:15.967
All right. Take your time.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.636
You know, Momma can't afford dessert
at every meal.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.472
And you don't need any more sugar.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.226
- Everything good?
- Yes, ma'am. Very good.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.687

11:35.612 --> 11:37.030

11:37.405 --> 11:39.616

- Aw!

11:51.419 --> 11:53.296

12:12.941 --> 12:14.984
That's a main ingredient in meth.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.196
He's paying cash.
He's got fraudulent credit cards.

this ain't brain science here.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.952

15:34.976 --> 15:36.060
Oh, what for?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.020
What, are you a cop?

15:38.104 --> 15:40.815
Do I look like one?

15:44.068 --> 15:46.028
I go to college in Baxter twice a week.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.906
At night, for your information.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.200
Hmm. What are you studying?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.787
Developmental biology.
Do you want to know my sign, too?

16:02.587 --> 16:04.005
Thanks for the cake.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.509
Yeah. You're welcome.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.177
Why'd you do that?

16:10.928 --> 16:12.889
I was just trying to be nice.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.391
Yeah? For what?

16:18.227 --> 16:20.480
I just think a kid should have
a piece of cake.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.107
Thanks.

16:24.775 --> 16:25.775
You're welcome.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.527
Yeah, what?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.571
I'm looking for a Mr. Roth?

17:11.696 --> 17:14.700
- A Mr. Michael Roth?
- No Michael fucker here now.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.786
Get the hell away from my door.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.954
Do you know of a Michael Roth?

17:20.164 --> 17:22.625
What the fuck is the matter with you?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.964
He used to live here. I was wondering
if you had any information about him,

17:28.047 --> 17:31.676
- or knew anyone who did, or anything...
- No, no, and no.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.052
Now, fuck off.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.888
- Hold on a second...
- You wanna break those fingers?

17:35.972 --> 17:38.724
- I can do that.
- I found this letter. It's 15 years old,

17:38.808 --> 17:40.601
but that's the return address.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.398
What are you, stupid?

17:45.815 --> 17:48.693
Nobody lives in this shit factory
for 15 years.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.489
All right. I'm sorry to disturb you.

17:53.948 --> 17:57.577
Eh. You took a shot, you know?
You can cross it off your list.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.216
Hey, man. Listen.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.012
There was a guy in here before me.
A veteran type.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.098
I'll tell you all about him
if you buy me a drink.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.685
Come on! Tell you what,

18:22.768 --> 18:26.063
if it wasn't him, we got nothing
to talk about, it cost you a beer.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.149
- I'm good, man.
- It's Christmas.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.360
Ho, ho, ho. Who's gonna know?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.619
Hey. You mind?

18:40.244 --> 18:42.496
- Help yourself.
- All right.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.999
Praise the Lord. He always provides.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.673
Hey, nice ride. What is it, a '71?

18:53.883 --> 18:57.303
That's the year I found
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

18:57.386 --> 18:59.430
and the honorable Jack Daniels.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.973
Jack's still with me.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.225
So, what's your name?

19:04.226 --> 19:06.771
Bukowski. My friends call me Charles.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.149
- Original.
- That's me, one of a kind.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.154
Since we're getting friendly,
what do they call you?

19:15.363 --> 19:16.363
Eric.

19:18.574 --> 19:19.742
Where are we going?

19:20.993 --> 19:25.081
While I get my bearings,
you drive, I'll point.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.187
Hey, uh, Tammy.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.480
Two Pabst.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.440
Actually, I'll take a Heineken.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.025
The Pabst are for me.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.486
You order whatever you want.
You're paying.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.029
Uh, Heineken, please.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.156
- You got it, darling.
- Oh, man.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.909
Um... you got any quarters?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.120
- For what?
- The jukebox.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.832
Look, I don't have time for this.
Are we gonna talk?

20:07.915 --> 20:09.375
It's about ambiance.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.128
It's a fucking holiday.
Show a little class.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.259
Ah.

20:18.884 --> 20:19.719
Here you go.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.470
<i>- Gracias.
- Por nada.</i>

20:21.595 --> 20:23.264
- And <i>gracias. </i> Ah.
- Enjoy.

20:23.806 --> 20:26.100
Oh, man. All righty.

20:38.028 --> 20:41.115
♪<i> Up on the rooftop, reindeer pause</i>♪

20:41.782 --> 20:44.577

Huh?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.287
♪ <i>Down </i>♪<i>...</i>

20:46.370 --> 20:48.622
Watch where you're going,
you drunk fucker!

20:48.706 --> 20:49.706
Drunk fucker?

20:49.749 --> 20:50.791
- Shit.
- Watch it!

20:50.875 --> 20:52.793
Hey! Settle down!

20:52.877 --> 20:55.004
- Get off me!
- Take it easy. He's drunk.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.089
I got an eye on him.
Everybody settle down.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.800
Ho, ho, ho! Ho! Oh!

21:02.094 --> 21:05.014
Stop. Sit down.

21:05.848 --> 21:06.974
What is wrong with you?

21:11.353 --> 21:12.772
Shit.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.484
I feel like, in all that kerfuckle...

21:17.234 --> 21:19.153
I seem to have misplaced my beverages.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.447
Do you mind?

21:23.532 --> 21:26.660
- You sure that's a good idea?
- Not all ideas are good ones,

21:26.744 --> 21:29.580
but they are ideas nevertheless.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.917
Tammy, could you get me another beer?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.336
And maybe get the one
off the jukebox for me?

21:35.419 --> 21:36.712
You got it, babe.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.049
So...

21:41.550 --> 21:42.550
Michael Roth?

21:43.093 --> 21:45.429
- Yeah?
- You said you knew him?

21:45.513 --> 21:48.015
I said I knew a guy
that said he was Michael Roth.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.392
What does that mean?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.020
What does what mean?

21:53.521 --> 21:55.439
The guy who lived in your apartment
before you.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.358
The guy, the guy, um...

21:57.900 --> 21:59.276
When I moved in there,

21:59.527 --> 22:01.654
to that shithole, about six years ago,

22:01.737 --> 22:04.198
literally, that guy was gone
before he moved out.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.075
He was a Vietnam vet.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.868
Oh, yeah? What did he look like?

22:09.870 --> 22:12.039
It was six years ago.
How the fuck would I remember?

22:12.122 --> 22:14.562
- I can't remember what I said to you.
- You have to remember.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.710
- Eric, right?
- You had a conversation with him.

22:16.794 --> 22:19.964
He had hair that grew
out of the top of his head, right?

22:20.381 --> 22:23.425
He was this big, but if I was standing up,
then my hand would be higher.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.510
No, really.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.763
He had a mid skin tone.
The guy spoke English.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.932
- Run with that.
- I'm glad this is a joke to you.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.434
- Am I scaring you off?
- Enjoy the beer.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.478
Hey, Merry Christmas to you.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.267
- What the hell?
- Can we ask you some questions?

23:13.392 --> 23:14.476
About what?

23:14.977 --> 23:17.438
Hot damn! You were right, Carl.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.189
Looks like we got something here.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.067
What's going on here?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.820
Ah, looks like illegal herb.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.990
Wait, that's not mine.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.325
- No?
- No.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.089
- Well, you're in some shit now.
- What?

23:44.173 --> 23:46.926
- This is an interrogation.
- Explain this.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.637
My toilet overflowed.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.931
Oh. Why didn't you call the front desk?

23:52.014 --> 23:54.683
That's what a normal person does
when their shitter overflows.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.769
- I was gonna fix it.
- Oh, you're a plumber.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.653
- Cook crystal? See this?
- What?

24:06.946 --> 24:09.823
- This here. This is indisputable.
- No. That ain't mine.

24:09.907 --> 24:12.117
Ain't mine!
Never heard that before.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.410
I gave someone a ride.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.120
- They left it in my car.
- Oh, yeah?

24:15.204 --> 24:17.706
Okay, and who's "they"?
Do you remember his name?

24:17.873 --> 24:19.458
- <i>Charles.</i>
<i>- Charles what?</i>

24:19.583 --> 24:21.710
- Am I being charged?
- You're fixing to be.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.129
This is bullshit.
I want to speak to a lawyer.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.632
Ain't a lawyer within 50 miles of here.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.841
Plus, it's Christmas.

24:28.175 --> 24:31.720
Ah! Oh, shit, it <i>is </i> Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Carl.

24:31.804 --> 24:32.638
Shut up.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.515
What the fuck you talking about?

24:41.063 --> 24:42.356
Hey, tough guy.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.608
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah?

24:45.734 --> 24:47.027
You running meth?

24:47.111 --> 24:48.195
- No.
- Be honest.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.446
- Ow! No!
- Be honest!

24:49.530 --> 24:51.010
Don't know what you're talking about.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.491
Drunk bastard. Stay down!

24:52.574 --> 24:53.742
Get off me, man!

24:55.285 --> 24:59.206
Oh, you think you come in this town,
peddling shit, huh?

24:59.289 --> 25:03.002
Getting our kids all strung out?
You are sorely mistaken.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.546
Ease up on him.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.339
- Ease up!
- Shut up, Billy!

25:07.589 --> 25:09.717
- Come on!
- He's running meth, and he knows it.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.282
- I'm not.
- You know you are.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.303
- You son of a bitch!
- Shit!

25:13.554 --> 25:14.722
Fuck, Carl!

25:14.805 --> 25:15.931
Why'd you do that?

25:18.642 --> 25:20.936
Merry Christmas, you drunk fucker!

25:25.149 --> 25:26.442
Fucking kids.

25:47.296 --> 25:50.591
Merry Christmas, <i>mi reina</i>.
I'm missing you a lot today.

25:52.051 --> 25:55.554
Don't worry about that Pabst girl.
She's a little too rigid for me.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.357
Oh, this damn cooler, man.

26:08.734 --> 26:09.735
¡<i>Cabrón</i>!

26:09.818 --> 26:12.321
Shit.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.077
No, no, señor.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.128
Cooler's out again?

26:28.212 --> 26:31.465
I tried that trick that you do.
I almost killed myself.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.384
- Well, you need a lady's touch.
<i>- Thank you, Katie.</i>

26:34.551 --> 26:36.720
- Okay, I'll be there in an hour.
- An hour?

26:37.262 --> 26:38.722
My beer will be piss in an hour.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.808
Okay, okay. I'll be there soon.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.109
Oh, you should ask for a raise, baby.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.362
You want something in life,
you gotta growl for it.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.447
Or do something more illicit.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.492
I am waiting for the day
you tell me I'm adopted.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.369
Well, you keep on waiting, sweetie.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.370
Uh-uh!

27:02.412 --> 27:04.623
That's for Dennis, honey.
You got your cereal.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.541
That's his name?

27:07.584 --> 27:10.170
Dennis McClarty.
All right, you can have one piece.

27:10.254 --> 27:13.966
Dennis the dental hygienist, wow.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.133
Yeah.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.846
I hope he's better at cleaning teeth
than he is at the hokey-pokey.

27:21.515 --> 27:24.268
- I thought I smelled bacon.
- Good morning.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.728
Mm!

27:26.812 --> 27:29.898
- Ooh, you brushed your teeth this morning.
- Oh, well...

27:29.982 --> 27:31.859
Your little talk scared the snot outta me.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.444
I'm gonna floss like I'm getting paid
for it.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.573
You be true to your teeth,
they'll never be false to you.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.033
Hi, Dennis McClarty.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.411
- Kate.
- Kate, that's a nice name.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.121
Who's this little guy, huh?

27:44.913 --> 27:47.332
Oh, he's the silent type, this one.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.251
Oh, well, silence is golden.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.045
Okay, I'll be back in a couple hours.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.130
Couple hours?

27:53.213 --> 27:56.133
- Well, Dennis and I were gonna go bowling.
- Yeah.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.343
But you did that last night.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.138
- Oh, we didn't make it.
- Make it.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.605
- We can take the little guy.
- Sure.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.642
- You like to bowl?
- We'll take Seth bowling.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.186
- Right?
- Oh, come on.

28:07.269 --> 28:08.312
Why you shaking your head?

28:18.155 --> 28:21.575
Mother of a bitch! Oh!

28:24.620 --> 28:25.787
Baby Jesus.

28:37.758 --> 28:38.800
Shit.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.265
Jesus.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.170
Hey. Hey!

29:15.254 --> 29:16.713
Get up. Come on, get up.

29:17.673 --> 29:20.509
Hey, put your arm down.
I'm not gonna hurt you. Sit up.

29:22.844 --> 29:23.844
Listen...

29:25.264 --> 29:26.723
you had a bag of pot.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.308
Okay? That's a fact.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.185
And you had some booze.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.561
And a bad credit card.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.064
As an officer of the law,
there's a lot to go on there.

29:34.147 --> 29:38.944
Now, in your defense,
my partner got pretty rough,

29:39.027 --> 29:42.072
and I'm sorry about that. Okay?

29:42.656 --> 29:44.324
That's not how we do things here.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.704
We're all in hot water now,
so here's what's gonna happen.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.332
I'm gonna go into the restroom,
over yonder.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.416
See that?

29:54.710 --> 29:58.505
I'm gonna put these keys,
your car keys, right there.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.301
And this is open. This is gonna be open.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.803
And I'm gonna be in the restroom.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.095
We clear?

30:09.141 --> 30:12.561
Hey, I'm gonna be in there
for quite a while.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.986
When do you get off duty?

30:22.154 --> 30:23.822
Been on duty my whole life.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.240
Every waking hour.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.243
It's been a long-ass night.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.204
You drinking that now?

30:32.998 --> 30:35.459
- Ain't it early?
- That's what I was thinking. It is...

30:35.542 --> 30:38.045
No, I mean a little early
for stupid questions.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.423
You been listening?
It's been a long night.

30:41.506 --> 30:45.052
I been listening. I just been thinking,
you shouldn't drink on the job, amigo.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.471
Maybe you should mind your own shit life.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.348
And I'll mind mine.

30:51.141 --> 30:52.142
That's all I got.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.477
I'll catch you later.

30:54.436 --> 30:55.436
Yes, sir.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.398
Glad to help
law enforcement get through the day.

30:58.482 --> 31:02.152
Yeah, yeah. <i>Feliz Navidad</i>.

Vicente, you can't let him run
all over you like that.

31:21.546 --> 31:25.008
He won't be around much longer.
His demons are catching up to him.

31:25.926 --> 31:26.927
How's my man doing?

31:27.969 --> 31:30.180

Yeah. Mm-hmm.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.126
Beer's not cold.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.920
Well, I am used to struggle.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.892
Ah, shit.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.194
Shit.

35:15.530 --> 35:20.493
How about the Jack, the Seven, and give me
that last Wild Turkey you have,

35:20.577 --> 35:23.079
and give me a half dozen
of your daily scratchers.

35:25.040 --> 35:29.169
Why don't you find yourself a good lady?
You wouldn't need all this liquor, Larry.

35:29.252 --> 35:32.172
This is how it works.
I give you money, you give me booze.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.757
It's just simple capitalism.

35:36.718 --> 35:39.137
- Why don't you grab a six-pack, on me?
- No shit?

35:39.262 --> 35:40.847
Trying to spread some cheer, bro.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.852
Look at that.
It's a Merry Christmas after all.

35:57.781 --> 35:59.282
Shots fired!

36:16.508 --> 36:18.218
- Seth!
- Keep your head down!

36:19.803 --> 36:21.638
Ah, shit!

36:21.763 --> 36:24.099
Goddamn! What did you do that for?

36:24.182 --> 36:25.350
It's military, asshole.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.186
You fire a gun at me, I'm gonna fire back.

36:28.269 --> 36:30.063
I wasn't shooting at you!

36:31.189 --> 36:33.858
- We got a fugitive right there.
- No, no, no, no.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.193
Your partner let me go.

36:35.276 --> 36:38.279
Yeah, you tell that to the judge.

36:38.363 --> 36:42.617
And you... you, hey! Hey! You're going
to jail for attempted murder.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.036
I aimed at your goddamn leg,
I hit you in the goddamn leg.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.872
That's what it looks like
when someone's not trying to kill you.

36:47.956 --> 36:50.125
- Hey, put that away.
- No, no, no, no!

36:50.792 --> 36:53.086
I ain't putting it down! Shut the fuck up!

36:53.169 --> 36:54.754
- Put it away!
- No!

36:56.464 --> 36:59.050
You listen, you're in deep shit.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.176
You got that?

37:00.260 --> 37:01.761
Now, you let everyone go,

37:01.845 --> 37:05.181
- and I promise you due process of law.
- I'm not holding anybody.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.600
Yeah, this is some fucked-up shit.
Look, I'm done.

37:07.684 --> 37:09.561
I'm out of this. I'm out of this.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.146
Hey, hey, hey!

37:11.229 --> 37:14.149
Hey, we don't want
a hostage situation here.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.692
God damn...

37:16.443 --> 37:17.443
you.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.988
Listen, I've got backup coming.

37:20.113 --> 37:23.616
You calm down
and we will talk this out.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.034
Oh, shit.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.460
- Sheriff's Department!
- Fuck.

37:33.543 --> 37:34.753
What's going on?

37:34.836 --> 37:38.298
- Put that shit down and crawl outta here.
- I ain't putting it down!

37:38.381 --> 37:41.634
- Put it down and get out! Now!
- How the hell am I supposed to get out?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.803
God damn it! How am I supposed to move?

37:48.141 --> 37:50.101
- Shit. Shit.
- Damn, damn. Listen.

37:51.436 --> 37:52.562
Hell's going on?

37:52.645 --> 37:55.774
Shut these blinds before RoboCop
out there fires another warning shot.

37:55.857 --> 37:57.984
- Close the blinds!
- Now! Go!

37:58.943 --> 38:02.238
- What's Carl doing all over the radio?
- It was shots fired, Sheriff!

38:02.322 --> 38:03.490
I know that, Billy!

38:03.573 --> 38:05.742
- Who the hell's firing?
- Get him away from the door.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.577
Okay. But I'm not an accessory, man.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.830
Carl was after a suspect.
Could be this kid we picked up.

38:10.914 --> 38:14.667
Who'd you pick up? Are you two
playing cops and robbers again?

38:15.752 --> 38:16.752
Billy.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.629
- You're holding us here?
- Everyone shut up!

38:21.674 --> 38:24.677
Just... just shut up and sit down.

38:25.428 --> 38:28.264
- I just need a minute to think.
- It's okay, honey.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.559
Now, do we know exactly who's in there?

38:31.976 --> 38:34.354
Not exactly, sir.

38:34.771 --> 38:36.439
I believe there's Carl.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.774
Hey, stop it.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.568
Come here. God damn it!

38:40.777 --> 38:42.445
Probably likely Vicente.

38:43.446 --> 38:46.658
And then, I'm guessing,
the kid we picked up. I think.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.116
Or not.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.205
- What's the plan?
- I'm gonna go in back.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.581
Okay, okay.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.542
Okay, okay.

38:55.625 --> 38:56.625
I got you.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.628
Criminal punk bastard.

38:58.753 --> 39:01.256
- Will you just shut the fuck up?
- You shut the fuck up!

39:01.339 --> 39:03.299
- Stop pointing that.
- Where are your handcuffs?

39:03.383 --> 39:05.802
Go to hell! God! Shit!

39:05.885 --> 39:07.846
Get 'em out. Get 'em out!

39:08.888 --> 39:10.390
Everybody be cool!

39:10.473 --> 39:12.225
Put your handcuffs on!

39:12.851 --> 39:16.104
- Is there a back way out?
- A window, but you won't fit through it.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.731
<i>Nobody moves, okay? Okay?</i>

39:19.607 --> 39:20.733
<i>God damn it!</i>

39:22.235 --> 39:26.281
Come out with your hands up!
You're... mostly surrounded!

39:52.640 --> 39:54.434
Freeze!

39:54.517 --> 39:56.769
- Shit!
- Shots fired! Shots fired!

40:00.690 --> 40:01.774
Oh, shit!

40:02.442 --> 40:04.068
God damn it.

40:07.614 --> 40:09.574
Taking fire, Sheriff! Taking fire!

40:09.699 --> 40:10.699
Returning fire!

40:12.702 --> 40:14.704
Damn it.

40:14.787 --> 40:15.997
Sheriff taking fire.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.461
- Everyone all right?
- It's okay.

40:21.544 --> 40:22.587
I got you. Just hold me.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.339
Quite a police force you got.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.049
Yeah. They're shooting at each other.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.384
Returning fire!

40:28.509 --> 40:30.595
Sheriff return...

40:33.848 --> 40:35.099
Wait... wait a minute.

40:36.726 --> 40:37.726
Stop firing.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.395
Yes, returning fire!

40:41.397 --> 40:42.565
Stand down.

40:42.815 --> 40:43.815
Man down?

40:43.858 --> 40:49.572
No, not "man down"!
Stand down! <i>Stand </i> down!

40:49.656 --> 40:54.285
- <i>Stop firing. You a fucking idiot?</i>
- Oh, okay. Stand down.

40:58.748 --> 41:00.750
Whatever your name is,
please just...

41:00.833 --> 41:02.502
His name is Eric Norris.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.088
Been running drugs out of Missouri.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.048
Picked him up last night. He's a fugitive.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.884
Now he can add kidnapping,
hit-and-run, and attempted murder!

41:09.968 --> 41:11.094
That's bullshit.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.930
Him and his partner arrested me
for no reason.

41:14.013 --> 41:17.392
That ain't true. He had weed
and crystal meth paraphernalia.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.310
I had Drano. And the weed was his.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.397
They beat the shit out of me
for trying to unclog a toilet.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.900
- You think I did this to myself?
- You're such a dick, Carl.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.653
What? You're gonna listen to him?

41:28.987 --> 41:29.987
Look at him.

41:30.780 --> 41:31.864
Then look at me.

41:34.659 --> 41:35.743
Sheriff, Sheriff!

41:35.868 --> 41:36.868
Sheriff!

41:41.833 --> 41:43.042
What are we gonna do?

41:49.424 --> 41:51.509
We're gonna get a time machine, Billy.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.554
And I'm gonna go back in time

41:55.054 --> 41:57.932
to when my cousin was dating your mother.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.060
And then I'm gonna yank his pecker off,

42:01.144 --> 42:04.397
right before he has the chance
to create an idiot.

42:19.996 --> 42:21.205
My guess is, that's for you.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.883
Hello?

42:32.467 --> 42:36.095
Well, looks like we got a situation here.

42:36.179 --> 42:37.179
Yeah.

42:37.722 --> 42:38.890
Yeah, I'd say we do.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.038
You're shooting up the place,
and there's innocent people here.

42:43.102 --> 42:44.395
Who am I talking to here?

42:44.812 --> 42:46.189
- This the suspect?
- No.

42:47.023 --> 42:48.816
The suspect's your guy
in here on the floor.

42:48.900 --> 42:49.900
Hey.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.153
You talking about Carl Hooker?

42:52.653 --> 42:53.654
Yeah, that's him.

42:55.531 --> 42:58.284
- Why the hell are you shooting at us?
- I'll tell you what.

42:58.659 --> 43:00.745
Why don't you come out,
and we'll talk about it?

43:01.204 --> 43:02.997
I promise you that you'll be safe.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.248
<i>Yeah, I trust you.</i>

43:04.332 --> 43:06.709
Every cop in this fucking town's insane.

43:11.130 --> 43:13.841
Now, when Jesus was born
in Bethlehem of Judea,

43:14.383 --> 43:16.677
wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,

43:16.761 --> 43:20.014
saying, "Where is he that is born
king of the Jews?

43:20.098 --> 43:23.101
For we have seen a star in the east,
and have come to worship him."

43:23.935 --> 43:25.478
Elias, say your line.

43:25.895 --> 43:27.563
Fear not, baby God.

43:28.147 --> 43:32.193
Lo, the star, which they saw
in the east, went before them.

43:32.276 --> 43:35.571
Until it came and stood over
where the young child was.

43:35.988 --> 43:39.450
When they saw the star, they rejoiced
with exceeding great joy.

43:40.159 --> 43:41.994
When they came into the house,

43:42.078 --> 43:45.039
they saw a young child
with Mary, his mother.

44:02.181 --> 44:04.892
<i>...law enforcement officers yesterday.</i>

44:05.017 --> 44:06.686
<i>Damn it, we have a situation.</i>

44:06.769 --> 44:09.897
<i>...inside Vicente's Liquor Mart.</i>

44:10.773 --> 44:12.608
- Come on!
- Let's go.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.153
This is the situation.

44:15.820 --> 44:19.657
Now, Carl, he radioed in
before he entered the place.

44:20.199 --> 44:23.703
But he never said who he was chasing,
or for what reason.

44:24.203 --> 44:28.124
We have no idea
where all these hostages are located.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.959
They could be
back by the liquor cabinet.

44:30.042 --> 44:31.586
They could be
there by the ice machine,

44:31.669 --> 44:34.630
they could be back there
in the crapper, or in Vicente's office.

44:35.131 --> 44:39.802
Hell, we don't even know who are
the hostages and who's the hostage-taker.

44:40.803 --> 44:44.974
Now, you said that you thought maybe
that this kid you arrested,

44:45.057 --> 44:47.226
- that he could be the gunman?
- Yes. Yes.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.145
I mean, I'm fairly certain.

44:49.478 --> 44:54.358
Although, I...
I do believe I saw two white males,

44:54.442 --> 44:56.444
twenties, duck behind the counter.

44:57.028 --> 45:01.199
And... I mean, this one's...
This is crazy,

45:01.282 --> 45:04.160
but I... I thought I saw a little kid.

45:05.745 --> 45:06.787
Jesus, Billy.

45:07.371 --> 45:08.206
Are you sure?

45:08.289 --> 45:11.709
I can't be positively positive for sure.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.169
But I... I'll tell you this.

45:13.252 --> 45:15.463
There's definitely four or five folks
in there, maybe.

45:16.172 --> 45:20.218
Well, this is a clusterfuck.

45:21.177 --> 45:24.388
All right, Billy...
you're the second-in-command.

45:25.264 --> 45:26.891
I want you to find out all you can.

45:26.974 --> 45:30.186
And make sure
that you secure this entire area.

45:30.311 --> 45:31.479
You got that?

45:31.938 --> 45:33.105
Absolutely, boss.

45:33.606 --> 45:35.233
Second-in-command, let's do this.

45:46.953 --> 45:47.953
Is he okay?

45:48.871 --> 45:50.623
You got yourself in a real mess here.

45:51.207 --> 45:52.847
What's your game plan?

45:52.917 --> 45:54.961
I'm just trying not to get anybody killed.

45:55.044 --> 45:58.172
Then put your gun down, your hands up,
and walk outside.

45:58.256 --> 46:00.258
No, no, that would be a bad idea.

46:01.425 --> 46:04.387
Whoever walks out that door
becomes a target.

46:04.804 --> 46:05.972
I've seen this before.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.682
Doesn't end well.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.559
You think you're right.
He thinks you're wrong.

46:11.352 --> 46:12.353
You lose.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.438
Then let me state the obvious.

46:14.522 --> 46:17.942
You, sir, have shot
a law enforcement officer.

46:18.276 --> 46:20.194
And you, you think you're not a criminal?

46:20.528 --> 46:22.655
I've never heard of good people
that hold hostages.

46:22.738 --> 46:25.533
And you shooting at my car,
trying to kill me. What's that?

46:25.616 --> 46:27.243
That is my word against yours.

46:27.326 --> 46:28.869
You see how this works now?

46:40.589 --> 46:41.589
Okay.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.511
Okay!

46:46.721 --> 46:48.014
Here's what we know for certain.

46:48.848 --> 46:52.268
Vicente Santos is the owner
of Vicente's Liquor Mart,

46:52.893 --> 46:55.104
and as such, he's probably on the scene.

46:55.938 --> 46:58.441
I think maybe Kate Daniels
is working the counter today.

46:58.524 --> 47:00.818
I called her house
and didn't get an answer, so...

47:00.901 --> 47:03.112
I'd deduce she's inside as well.

47:03.738 --> 47:05.698
Which led me to further deduce...

47:06.532 --> 47:09.410
that the little boy inside,
if in fact there is a little boy,

47:09.493 --> 47:10.953
probably her son, Seth.

47:11.037 --> 47:12.037
Okay.

47:13.289 --> 47:15.416
Run the plates on all these vehicles here.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.084
Already did that.

47:17.168 --> 47:20.463
First, we got Vicente's pickup truck,
the blue Dodge.

47:20.921 --> 47:24.050
You got that little shitbox import,
that's Kate Daniels' car.

47:24.258 --> 47:26.052
Carl's patrol vehicle's down the road,

47:26.135 --> 47:28.637
and it appears to have been
in some kind of altercation.

47:29.055 --> 47:31.307
And then we have the Chevelle.

47:31.932 --> 47:32.975
That's Eric Norris'.

47:33.059 --> 47:36.729
Now that's the suspect
that Carl and I tangled with last night.

47:37.146 --> 47:39.315
He may or may not be the hostage-taker.

47:41.067 --> 47:43.277
- Did you hit your head or something?
- No.

47:43.569 --> 47:45.905
You're starting to act
like a damn police officer.

47:48.074 --> 47:49.867
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.244
You want me to re-establish contact
with the inside?

47:52.328 --> 47:54.663
No. I just want to sit here
and think for a minute.

47:55.414 --> 47:58.793
All right, 'cause I could function
as a negotiator,

47:58.876 --> 48:00.836
establish a rapport maybe.

48:01.337 --> 48:03.089
It's not a damn movie, Billy.

48:04.256 --> 48:06.258
You're not Samuel fucking Jackson.

48:15.476 --> 48:16.936
Wow. Look at that.

48:18.062 --> 48:19.438
This is cool.

48:21.649 --> 48:22.691
Man, looks bad.

48:23.609 --> 48:24.609
Yeah.

48:27.988 --> 48:29.281
<i>It's a security camera.</i>

48:29.448 --> 48:32.243
Yeah, everything's on tape.

48:32.326 --> 48:35.204
<i>You with my gun, and you shooting at me.</i>

48:35.287 --> 48:37.927
- You're on it too, asshole.
- Hey, where are the controls?

48:38.416 --> 48:39.625
My office in the back.

48:39.708 --> 48:42.128
- I'll show you where they are.
- I'll show him.

48:44.338 --> 48:45.381
Fine.

48:51.303 --> 48:53.347
Holy shit, they're everywhere.

48:53.431 --> 48:54.974
Yeah, is that a surprise?

48:56.016 --> 48:57.852
Oh, God.

49:01.355 --> 49:02.898
Look, you want my advice?

49:03.190 --> 49:05.693
If you didn't do anything,
just turn yourself in.

49:06.318 --> 49:09.738
Turn myself in? To the same cops
that are shooting at us for no reason?

49:09.822 --> 49:12.408
Yeah. You're holding two old men
and my child hostage.

49:12.491 --> 49:13.784
At least let them go.

49:14.243 --> 49:16.579
I will. I'm gonna let you all go. I swear.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.706
What are you doing here anyway?

49:18.789 --> 49:20.249
What'd you come here for?

49:21.459 --> 49:22.293
To find someone.

49:22.376 --> 49:23.919
- Yeah? Who?
- A man.

49:24.003 --> 49:25.546
- What man?
- Does it really matter?

49:25.629 --> 49:26.881
Yeah, it does matter.

49:29.925 --> 49:31.427
My father used to live here.

49:32.136 --> 49:33.137
Or he still does.

49:33.262 --> 49:35.681
I don't know, so I came here
to try and find him.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.641
What, and you've never met him?

49:37.725 --> 49:39.143
No, I've never met him.

49:40.269 --> 49:43.230
Thought it might be a good time,
being Christmas and all, but,

49:43.355 --> 49:46.192
in hindsight,
that wasn't such a good idea.

49:53.073 --> 49:54.867
Oh, goody, goody, TV.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.661
We can watch <i>Die Hard</i>.
That's a great Christmas movie.

49:58.871 --> 50:01.332
Vicente's Hostage Mart. Merry Christmas!

50:01.415 --> 50:03.334
- I'm not talking to them.
- Mm...

50:11.342 --> 50:13.010
Hey, what are you doing?

50:14.261 --> 50:15.095
Talk to me.

50:15.179 --> 50:18.182
You got 30 minutes
to release all hostages.

50:18.432 --> 50:22.561
If you don't release them,
we are gonna gas this place.

50:23.145 --> 50:27.233
I advise that you surrender any women
and children forthwith.

50:27.316 --> 50:29.276
You done yakking? Now listen up!

50:29.360 --> 50:31.946
Okay, and who is this?

50:32.071 --> 50:34.615
- The guy you're talking to.
- Don't say anything stupid.

50:34.698 --> 50:36.367
Are you a hostage?

50:37.034 --> 50:38.869
We want money, lots of money.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.539
Do-re-mi. Big bills.

50:41.622 --> 50:45.042
Christmastime, we didn't get any packages,
we're all pissed off in here.

50:45.125 --> 50:47.336
Unmarked
and none of that blue dye or anything.

50:47.419 --> 50:48.420
Bye.

50:52.007 --> 50:53.008
Seriously?

50:53.634 --> 50:55.010
What the fuck is wrong with you?

50:55.553 --> 50:58.806
- I have always wanted to do that.
- You're out of your goddamn mind.

50:58.931 --> 51:01.475
- You better call them back.
- They're at 911.

51:01.559 --> 51:04.270
- They're gonna think you're part of this.
- They're not.

51:04.353 --> 51:05.896
It's a bunch of dumb shits out there.

51:06.313 --> 51:07.773
Well, that was an older man.

51:08.274 --> 51:10.317
That wasn't that kid I spoke to earlier.

51:10.401 --> 51:12.111
You saying it was an older man?

51:13.237 --> 51:14.613
That's what I just said.

51:15.114 --> 51:17.616
- Okay.
- So, who the hell is who in there?

51:17.950 --> 51:19.451
Well, here's what we know.

51:19.577 --> 51:22.955
Vicente Santos is the owner
of Santos Liquor Mart, and as such...

51:23.038 --> 51:27.334
Damn it, I know what you got written
in your little notebook there, Sherlock.

51:28.210 --> 51:30.713
That wasn't Vicente,
and it sure as hell wasn't Carl.

51:30.796 --> 51:32.840
Well, I don't have a vehicle
for an old-timer.

51:32.965 --> 51:36.260
- I got Vicente's blue pickup...
- Did you talk to that reporter yet?

51:36.635 --> 51:38.596
- No.
- What the hell you waiting for?

51:38.721 --> 51:39.721
Okay.

51:46.270 --> 51:47.313
I'm hungry.

51:47.521 --> 51:48.814
I think we should eat.

51:48.897 --> 51:50.691
The peanuts just aren't doing it.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.359
Come on. What do you say?

51:53.485 --> 51:56.655
We are live, outside
of Vicente's Liquor Mart in El Camino,

51:56.739 --> 52:00.200
<i>in the midst of what appears
to be a hostage situation</i>

52:00.284 --> 52:01.952
<i>on Christmas Eve.</i>

52:02.036 --> 52:05.289
<i>Authorities cannot confirm the identities
of the hostages.</i>

52:05.372 --> 52:08.125
- <i>However, Action 19 News has learned...</i>
- Oh, my grace.

52:08.208 --> 52:11.086
<i>...that Deputy Carl Hooker,
of El Camino's sheriff's department,</i>

52:11.211 --> 52:12.963
<i>is trapped inside the mart.</i>

52:28.562 --> 52:32.024
So, Carl, why don't you tell us
what really happened last night?

52:32.107 --> 52:35.235
You'll find out in court,
or at his funeral.

52:35.361 --> 52:36.945
He don't know the truth at this point.

52:38.030 --> 52:39.030
Come on.

52:39.823 --> 52:40.991
Give us the truth.

52:41.075 --> 52:43.369
- We're all friends here.
- What good is the truth?

52:43.452 --> 52:45.537
The truth will set you free.

52:45.663 --> 52:46.538
Set us free.

52:46.622 --> 52:49.208
I mean, you're a drunk, we all know that.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.001
- It's a small town.
- You're a drunk.

52:51.126 --> 52:52.920
Yeah, but I don't hide behind a badge.

52:53.170 --> 52:54.546
I don't drink and drive.

52:57.549 --> 52:58.676
You ran a red light.

53:00.344 --> 53:03.097
- He had narcotics in his system.
- Yeah?

53:04.556 --> 53:07.976
- What'd you have in your system?
- Had a little blonde girl in my system.

53:08.102 --> 53:09.436
How about that? Ha!

53:09.520 --> 53:11.647
- That's disgusting.
- Tell you what, Carl.

53:13.273 --> 53:15.442
Tell everybody here
what really happened last night,

53:15.526 --> 53:17.861
and I'll walk outside
and surrender right now.

53:28.580 --> 53:30.340
<i>Is there anything else</i>
<i>you can tell us</i>

53:30.416 --> 53:32.710
about the people in the store
when you were shopping?

53:32.793 --> 53:33.794
Not really.

53:35.295 --> 53:36.295
Hello, ma'am.

53:37.005 --> 53:40.926
I'm with the sheriff's department.
Oh, my! They hide that well on TV.

53:41.176 --> 53:42.803
- Beth Flowers.
- Oh, I know.

53:43.011 --> 53:44.096
Billy Calhoun.

53:44.221 --> 53:45.639
Deputy Billy Calhoun.

53:45.723 --> 53:48.475
Second-in-command here on the scene.

53:49.017 --> 53:51.145
May I ask you a few questions?

53:51.270 --> 53:53.939
- Yes, ma'am. That's why I'm here.
- Fantastic.

53:55.649 --> 53:59.945
<i>Deputy Calhoun, do you have any idea
who the gunman is?</i>

54:00.112 --> 54:02.489
<i>Do you have a name? A suspect?</i>

54:03.240 --> 54:06.493
<i>Uh, well, me and my partner and I,</i>

54:06.577 --> 54:09.663
<i>Deputy Carl Hooker, H-O-O-K-E-R,</i>

54:09.747 --> 54:13.584
<i>- arrested a young man last night.</i>
<i>- And what was he arrested for?</i>

54:13.667 --> 54:16.962
He was drug running.

54:17.796 --> 54:19.298
Methamphetamine, we imagine.

54:19.381 --> 54:23.552
We had the suspect, Mr. Eric Norris,

54:23.635 --> 54:27.639
<i>under surveillance
because he fit a profile</i>

54:27.723 --> 54:29.475
<i>- with a gold credit card.
- Eric Norris...</i>

54:29.558 --> 54:30.809
<i>- Drano.
- ...you said?</i>

54:30.893 --> 54:32.436
<i>Well, it's just a feeling you get</i>

54:32.519 --> 54:34.772
<i>when you've been doing this
as long as we have.</i>

54:34.855 --> 54:36.315
<i>It's like a sixth sense.</i>

54:36.440 --> 54:37.775
<i>- Off the record.
- Right.</i>

54:38.066 --> 54:39.066
<i>Right.</i>

54:40.068 --> 54:44.156
So, the suspect posts bail
and was released?

54:44.823 --> 54:46.283
Not exactly. No, ma'am.

54:48.619 --> 54:49.912
<i>He escaped.</i>

54:51.288 --> 54:53.624
- Escaped from?
- From our facilities.

54:53.707 --> 54:54.707
<i>County jail?</i>

54:55.167 --> 54:56.167
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

54:57.002 --> 54:58.837
<i>How does that happen, exactly?</i>

55:00.297 --> 55:01.548
<i>You know, we just...</i>

55:01.632 --> 55:03.467
<i>We want to get everyone
outta here safely,</i>

55:03.550 --> 55:07.054
<i>and reunited with their loved ones
before this very special holiday.</i>

55:08.639 --> 55:10.808
<i>All right. This is Beth Flowers
reporting from...</i>

55:10.891 --> 55:13.644
<i>If you have any further questions,
I will be on scene.</i>

55:14.228 --> 55:15.354
<i>Just look for...</i>

55:16.396 --> 55:17.396
<i>Okay.</i>

55:17.731 --> 55:22.361
<i>This is Beth Flowers, reporting live
from Vicente's Liquor Mart.</i>

55:27.324 --> 55:29.576
I'm gonna need some medical attention.

55:31.078 --> 55:32.078
Start talking.

55:33.831 --> 55:36.625
Oh, you're gonna have a dead cop
on your hands,

55:36.708 --> 55:38.377
you don't get me out of here soon.

55:38.460 --> 55:41.505
That's... that's life in prison.

55:42.798 --> 55:43.798
He's right.

55:44.466 --> 55:45.466
Dead pig...

55:46.093 --> 55:47.177
<i>no es bueno</i>.

55:49.638 --> 55:51.181
I just want my life back.

55:52.140 --> 55:55.227
I wanna rewind before I ever came here.
You can do that.

55:59.106 --> 56:01.400
I'm just gonna tell them what happened.

56:01.483 --> 56:02.483
You know?

56:03.485 --> 56:05.112
Everybody's got their own truth.

56:05.195 --> 56:06.613
- You know?
- Yeah.

56:08.657 --> 56:10.158
Only one of them's right.

56:10.242 --> 56:11.660
Only God knows.

56:12.786 --> 56:15.497
He probably knows you don't know shit.

56:15.998 --> 56:18.250
The fuck you know, Vicente.

56:20.460 --> 56:22.588
Remember when your alarm went off?

56:24.548 --> 56:26.800
I was the first one to arrive here.

56:28.385 --> 56:29.385
You were home...

56:30.804 --> 56:32.347
taking care of your sick wife.

56:32.431 --> 56:33.431
Remember?

56:35.475 --> 56:37.686
Huh? I saved your business.

56:45.027 --> 56:46.153
And you, blondie.

56:48.822 --> 56:50.657
Who'd you come running to...

56:51.867 --> 56:54.328
when your boyfriend
was slapping you around?

56:55.037 --> 56:56.037
Hmm?

56:57.748 --> 57:00.042
I ran that ingrate outta town.

57:05.839 --> 57:07.758
And you, you fucking drunk,

57:08.258 --> 57:11.053
with your goddamn Vietnam sob story.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.481
I been cleaning all your messes.

57:22.940 --> 57:23.941
All y'all's.

57:30.113 --> 57:31.406
See, that's my truth.

57:36.411 --> 57:38.121
You, son, are a bad seed.

57:41.375 --> 57:43.669
I'm just doing my job.

57:46.838 --> 57:48.006
What's your truth?

58:02.938 --> 58:04.564
My mom passed away.

58:05.482 --> 58:07.401
I found a letter from my father.

58:07.693 --> 58:08.944
I never met the guy.

58:09.820 --> 58:14.199
So, I came here to try to close a loop.

58:21.123 --> 58:22.666
And that's when you came along.

58:38.056 --> 58:43.103
Well, damn. It's a Christmas miracle,
right here on County Road 191.

58:43.186 --> 58:44.312
Folks, who wants a beer?

58:44.396 --> 58:47.315
You got any of that Bud Lemon?

58:48.025 --> 58:50.193
Bud Light Lemon, that's my favorite.

58:50.277 --> 58:51.277
Got it.

58:52.696 --> 58:53.822
Got it, buddy.

58:53.905 --> 58:55.198
Ooh, ooh.

58:55.699 --> 58:56.700
Stood up too fast.

58:57.117 --> 58:58.117
All right!

58:58.243 --> 59:00.412
It's Christmas. Yum!

Sheriff Fuller, what can you tell us
about Eric Norris?

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:44.933
You see that barricade over there?

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:47.018
The one that you just walked over?

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:51.273
How would you like to spend Christmas
on a four-by concrete pad?

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:53.358
Sheriff, we're going national.

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:54.568
This is a live feed.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.988
So, you either cooperate
and answer the questions,

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.407
or we report it as we see it.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.575
It's up to you.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:02.950
All right.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.495
I'll give you one comment.

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:12.252
Sheriff, at exactly what time
did Eric Norris escape your custody?

01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:19.593
We can't comment on that at this time.

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:23.013
We also have not released
any statement indicating

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:27.559
that one Eric Norris is responsible
for this situation.

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:30.187
What exactly are you sure of, Sheriff?

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.564
I'll tell you what we know here.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:35.734
There is a criminal in that liquor mart.

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:38.862
And he's holed up in there
with numerous hostages.

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:41.865
Exactly how many hostages,
we can't be certain at this time.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:47.120
Now, you get your ass
behind that barricade.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:48.663
Yes, sir. Thank you so much, sir.

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:50.207
I really appreciate it.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.835
This is gonna get us live.

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:56.296
Seth needs to go to the bathroom.

01:01:57.005 --> 01:01:58.256
All right. Fine.

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:01.258
Anybody else?

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:03.010
I'm good.

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.889
Piss on you.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.434
Come on. Keep close.
Keep your heads down.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:15.899
In there.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.038
Why'd you wait so long
to come looking for him?

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:37.379
Uh... I didn't know anything about him.
My mom never talked about him.

01:02:37.963 --> 01:02:40.882
I found all these letters
that he wrote to her.

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:43.718
Must have been a hundred of 'em.

01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:47.764
And I just couldn't get him
out of my head.

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:53.436
Yeah, I didn't know my dad much either.

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:57.148
He bolted right after I was born.

01:02:57.315 --> 01:03:01.820
So, it's been a revolving door
of step-men ever since.

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:11.412
Psst.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.165
Hey. Psst! Psst!

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:16.418
Hey.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:18.878
- Psst!
- The fuck's wrong with you, Carl?

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:25.468
Hey, man. Go on.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:33.810
I got a .22 in the small of my back.

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:34.893
What the fuck?

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:38.982
- Get that for me.
- I hate to tell you, I'm tired, huh.

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:42.694
Huh? Hey, listen to me.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:46.865
Listen! You think
we're gonna get out of here alive?

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:50.827
That boy, if he's a good person,

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.621
he'd have let us go a long time ago.

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:59.002
Now, I ain't gonna hurt no one.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.170
Look at me.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:02.797
Look at me, bro.

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:04.466
I'll give you my word.

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:07.344
Look, look, I'll give you my word.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:11.014
You're crazy if you don't think you need
some kind of protection.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.767
You're crazier if you think

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.479
that your shop ain't gonna get
fucked up beyond repair

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.064
when this thing blows up.

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:22.650
So, come on, hey, hey.

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:25.320
Oh, god damn it.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:26.780
Come on, get it.

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:29.366
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get it, get it, get it.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.288
You need some help with that?

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:38.541
Let me see it.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.877
I used to love these things.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.048
Ah, yeah, see?

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:48.176
You see this little thing right here?

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.887
Pull that out a little bit...

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.850
and your batteries won't pop out
every time you run into something.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.354
All right, try it now.

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:18.456
I think I'm gonna let everybody
outta here.

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:23.378
It's the only good thing left to do.

01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:32.262
Now, listen to me, boys.

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:36.558
The truth of the matter is,
we can't negotiate with a crazy person.

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.518
So, when this goes down,

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:41.938
you are just gonna have to keep your cool.

01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:45.275
Son of a bitch.
Just give me that goddamn thing.

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:49.737
Frank, you're going
through the front with me.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:52.407
Billy, you and Garret,
you cover that back window.

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.617
Now, listen to me.
He can't get out that window,

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.953
but that don't mean
he can't shoot your ass from there,

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:58.371
- so you watch it.
- Roger that.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.124
Now, we are gonna resolve this thing

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:04.752
before those damn Feds show up,
swinging their dicks around.

01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:06.003
This is our town.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.423
And we're gonna settle it.

01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:21.436
Whose is that?

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:23.980
Oh, sounds like my boss.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.317
Now, go ahead and answer it.
Tell him we're all coming out.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.400
Yeah?

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.570
Take my handcuffs off.

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:33.114
I'll bite your head off.

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.533
I'll bite your head right off.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:39.704
Do the right thing, Carl.

01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:44.000
Let's see here.

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:48.963
Yello.

01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:52.175
Carl, what you got in there?

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:53.259
<i>I got six people.</i>

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:54.677
One's a kid.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.096
<i>All right, listen up.</i>

01:06:57.597 --> 01:07:00.225
You try to get everybody
down on the floor, Carl.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:03.436
'Cause in exactly two minutes...

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:05.813
we're coming in.

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:08.399
- Asshole's trying something funny.
- What are you doing?

01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:11.027
- Oh, he's going crazy now.
- You son of a bitch.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.112
- Help me, help me, help me!
- Give me that.

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:16.699
Ah, fuck.

01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:22.747
<i>We have a tragic story developing
in the town of El Camino, Nevada.</i>

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.415
<i>A group of Christmas shoppers,</i>

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:26.709
<i>caught in a liquor mart,
have been taken hostage.</i>

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:31.297
<i>Our regional correspondent, Beth Flowers,
is live on the scene for us.</i>

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:34.801
<i>Beth, can you tell us more about
the events that are unfolding down there?</i>

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:35.884
<i>Yes, Soledad.</i>

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:38.221
<i>Christmas Eve has turned into a nightmare</i>

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:41.474
for a group of people being held hostage
in the liquor mart behind me.

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.811
El Camino County Sheriff's Patrol
responded to a distress call

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:45.895
by one of their own.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.940
We believe Vicente Santos and Kate Daniels

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:51.234
are also being held captive.

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:53.069
I'm here with Jewels Daniels.

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:57.365
Ms. Daniels, you believe
your daughter is inside the mart.

01:07:57.448 --> 01:07:58.324
Is that true?

01:07:58.449 --> 01:07:59.701
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:01.703
She has my grandson with her.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.539
He's only five.

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:07.625
Do it! Do it!

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:13.298
Hey, you guys, get away
from the window. Get in the aisle, now.

01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:15.758
Stay down.
- What's happening, Carl?

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:17.635
Shut up, Vicente.

01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:19.136
You gave me your word, man.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.014
Get down! Cover that kid's head!

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.100
Shit.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.645
- He's doing something. Eric!
- No!

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:29.479
- He's got a gun!
- Eric!

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:32.609
Hell no! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:34.777
No!

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.158
Shots fired!

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:42.136
- Drop your weapon!
- No, no, no!

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:43.703
He's got a gun!

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.555
- No, don't shoot!
- Vicente!

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:46.580
Don't shoot!

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:56.049
Man down!

01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:59.426
Hold your fire!

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:02.180
- Hold your fire, damn it!
- Vicente!

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:03.930
Vicente!

01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:26.996
Hey, you're bleeding, man.

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:30.207
Oh, shit! Oh!

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.042
Hey.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.420
Oh, listen.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:36.756
I think it's just...
You're gonna be all right.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:37.839
Beth!

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:43.136
Are you okay?

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:56.025
Just sit up, if you can.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:57.318
All right?

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:58.695
There you go.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.863
This is some mess
you've gotten yourself into, Sheriff.

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:45.074
Whole country's been watching
this stupidity unfold.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.619
Why don't you wait behind the barricade?

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.874
It's like a fucking war zone in here, man.

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:55.251
Yeah, friendly fire.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.253
Hell on earth.

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.340
This is gonna hurt a little bit.

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:04.635
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.053
Ready? Here.

01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:07.764
Come on, put some pressure on it.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:20.066
Hmm.

01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:27.158
Christmas, 1960... 69, Vietnam.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.496
The Valley of Death.

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:35.249
I called the coordinates.

01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:40.296
One-five-four-seven north,

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:43.800
one-zero-eight-three-six east.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:48.930
Just, there was a village,
nothing there...

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:52.266
but farmers and families.

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:58.731
So, I aborted the artillery strike.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:08.699
And then artillery started raining down
on us.

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:11.619
Twenty-two soldiers dead, 78 civilians,

01:12:11.702 --> 01:12:13.496
and they blamed it all on you.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:15.957
I read your letters.

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:24.757
Twenty-two of the bravest men
I've ever met,

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:28.427
just doing what they were told,
what I told them to do.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.519
I spent a great deal of my life
trying to make it up to those...

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:38.896
those guys.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:41.774
Find some sort of truth in all this.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.820
I lost it at every turn. And I was...

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:49.490
I got court-martialed over it.

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:54.787
I lost my house and my money
and my self-respect.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:55.871
Your wife.

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.757
Your mother deserved more than that.

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:09.677
Yeah, she did.

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:15.725
So did you.

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:18.351
Yeah.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:32.408
Ah, it was a good Christmas, though.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.703
Tell you what...

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:41.250
this was a close second.

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:56.890
Here...

01:13:58.309 --> 01:13:59.309
answer it.

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.479
You guys should get outta here.

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.107
Hello?

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.778
This is Special Agent Patterson.
Who is this?

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:10.404
<i>Kate Daniels, I work here.</i>

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:13.282
My son, Seth, is here,
and we're going to be coming out.

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:14.742
So, please don't shoot.

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:17.328
Okay, you got my word, Kate.
You and Seth are safe to come out.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:20.122
Now, Kate, the gunman, is he alone?

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:21.332
Has he been shot?

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.960
Yeah. No. I don't know.

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.586
You and Seth come on out.

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:27.755
We'll handle it from there.

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.760
Okay, he's sending out two hostages.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:34.553
The girl and her son!

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.390
Lower your firearms!

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:39.558
Here's to Eric and Kate.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.145
You guys look good on each other.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:47.942
What is it?

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:03.207
Here you go, little man.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.376
Thank you.

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:09.671
You're welcome.

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:14.385
Hey, those were...

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:16.512
Those were really great words.

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:19.807
Really great.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:26.939
Be careful.

01:15:30.818 --> 01:15:33.154
Okay. Okay. Look at me, okay?

01:15:33.237 --> 01:15:35.406
- Look at me.
- Love and turmoil.

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:39.035
Best combination known to man.

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:43.080
You should probably go, too.

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:44.582
Nah, are you kidding?

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:48.544
I'm gonna stick around.
This is the most fun I've had in years.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.005
Hmm...

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.386
Kate Daniels
and her son are exiting the liquor mart,

01:15:57.928 --> 01:16:00.431
and they are safely
in the hands of authorities.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:03.975
Oh...

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.394
You all right?

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:06.478
No!

01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:12.401
<i>Apparently,
we're having some technical issues</i>

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:14.087
<i>- in El Camino.</i>
<i>- Settle down.</i>

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:16.405
<i>We'll get Beth Flowers back
as soon as we can.</i>

01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:19.575
Well, they'll be coming in now.

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:24.080
I'm sure they've done the math, right?

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:29.126
Six minus four equals two.

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:33.923
So, either you're the bad guy,
or it's me.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.219
I'm the only one that hasn't been shot.

01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:40.596
I'm just gonna tell the truth.

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:44.058
The truth is a tricky son of a bitch.

01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:54.568
What do you want for Christmas?

01:16:57.321 --> 01:16:59.990
To get out of here, for one.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:11.585
Well, no ask is too big
for the spirit of the holidays.

01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:12.795
That's what I say.

01:17:17.174 --> 01:17:18.174
You know what?

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:23.305
Christmas is over too quick.

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.225
It's all the buildup...

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.646
and then, bam.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.775
Tree's all dried out.

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:37.444
Family leaves.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.117
And there's shit everywhere.

01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:55.171
You know, Eric Norris...

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:02.011
...you're a good man.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:06.891
Maybe I did something right.

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:11.520
What are you doing?

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:16.442
Well, it's not often a guy gets a chance
to right so many wrongs.

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:24.325
Don't go out there holding the gun.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.957
Merry Christmas, Eric Norris.

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:34.919
Sure was nice to meet you.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:46.931
Too bad we didn't meet earlier.

01:18:47.514 --> 01:18:49.225
Oh, the things we could have done.

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:50.684
Larry.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:53.062
- He's coming out!
- Don't go out there!

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:54.980
Sir! This is the FBI.

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:58.192
Step forward! Get on the ground!

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:03.530
On the ground, now!

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:06.367
Hey, take care of yourself.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.119
Put the gun down!

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:10.162
Put it down, Larry!

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:14.541
Listen, I've left one person in there
that needs medical help.

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:17.461
It's okay, we'll take care
of him. Put the gun down!

01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:18.544
Larry, put it down!

01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:24.718
The life of man...

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:28.764
solitary, poor...

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:31.100
nasty, brutish...

01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:36.814
...and short.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:41.526
No, no!

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:43.612
Hold your fire!

01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:45.698
- Hold your fire!
- No!

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:03.674
It better be better up there, amigo.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:06.010
That's all I'm saying.

01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:10.222
That's... that's all...
that's all I'm saying.

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:13.392
That's all... that's all I'm saying.

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:16.936
Oh...

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:56.393
Oh my God, baby, what happened?
What happened in there?

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:02.941
Okay, honey. He's not...

01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:05.611
Ms. Flowers.

01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:11.867
Get us out!
It hurts so bad!

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:50.531
I don't want to smoke anymore.

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:52.032
It's not who I am.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:54.618
I don't want to smoke anymore.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.620
It's not who I am.

01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:59.998
I have the willpower to choose my life.

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.502
I have the willpower to change my life.

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:06.004
Choose, choose.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:08.841
Choose, choose.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:12.052
Senator Allen, just today,
admitted his relationship

01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:15.055
with the pharmaceutical giant
was financially beneficial

01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:18.142
to both his campaign
and his campaign staff.

01:22:18.225 --> 01:22:21.895
I'm Beth Flowers, reporting live
from Austin, Texas.

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:23.480
Back to you, Soledad.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:26.692
Oh, my goodness!

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.652
Do it again! Do it again.

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:32.573
Looks like tomorrow's gonna be hotter
than two rats fucking in a wool sock.

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:36.410
So, powder up your balls and stay inside.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:38.245
Powder up your balls!

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:39.830
'Cause they get sweaty.

01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:43.709
- So, you say they're back, are they?
- I believe so.

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.336
When you shine your light on them,
they run off?

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.338
- They sure did.
- Not surprised.

01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:50.424
I'm gonna call animal control for you.

01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:52.843
Uh, raccoons are not really
a police matter.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:57.473
Listen, I sure appreciate you putting this
on your property.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:01.185
I'm gonna clean up El Camino.
That's my promise.

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:04.897

Four gunshot wounds.

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:24.249
Thirty-two million dollars.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:28.712

One more bite.

- Um, we didn't order that.
