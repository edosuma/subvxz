16, prime...

00:51.120 --> 00:53.315

00:59.160 --> 01:00.496
West Virginia
Collegiate Institute

01:00.520 --> 01:03.159
is the best school for
Negros in the state.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.595
It's the only school
past the eighth grade

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
anywhere near here.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.793
Isosceles.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.873
Scalene.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.632
Equilateral.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.708
Rhombus.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.677
Trapezoid.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.831
Katherine's in the sixth grade.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.056
They want to
take her early.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.718
Tetrahedron.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.558
Dodecahedron.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.416
They're offering
a full scholarship.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.919
All you have to do
is get there.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.829
Ms. Coleman...

01:31.560 --> 01:34.711
why don't you solve
the equation on the board?

01:41.600 --> 01:43.192
We took up a collection

01:43.280 --> 01:44.679
amongst the teachers and such.

01:44.840 --> 01:45.840
It's not a lot...

01:45.920 --> 01:48.115
but it's enough
to help get you settled in.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.509
That's more than kind,
Ms. Sumner.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.776
If the product of two terms

02:04.800 --> 02:06.870
is zero then common sense says

02:07.000 --> 02:10.116
at least one of the two terms
has to be zero to start with.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.192
So if you move all the
terms over to one side,

02:13.400 --> 02:15.391
you can put the quadratics
into a form

02:15.480 --> 02:16.708
that can be factored...

02:16.880 --> 02:18.472
allowing that side
of the equation

02:18.560 --> 02:19.560
to equal zero.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.856
Once you've done that,
it's pretty straightforward

02:21.880 --> 02:22.880
from there.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.920
In all my years
of teaching...

02:28.560 --> 02:31.393
I've never seen a mind like
the one your daughter has.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.400
Katherine!

02:33.480 --> 02:35.232
Hurry on now, love.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.279
You have to go.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.752
Let Mama tuck you in.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.594
You have to see
what she becomes.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.318
Okay,
try to turn it over now.

03:17.800 --> 03:18.949
Katherine?

03:19.520 --> 03:20.794
Mary!

03:21.280 --> 03:22.280
Somebody!

03:22.400 --> 03:23.400
Katherine!

03:23.520 --> 03:25.954
Quit staring off into space
and turn the damn car over.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.269
I got it.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.149
I'm not deaf.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.320
I wonder sometimes.

03:32.880 --> 03:33.880
Here it goes.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.790
Yeah,
it's the starter.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.793
That is definitely the starter.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.791
This starter is starting
to make us late.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.400
We are all gonna
end up unemployed...

03:45.480 --> 03:47.869
riding around in this pile
of junk to work every day.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.798
You're welcome
to walk the 16 miles.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.991
Or sit in the back of the bus.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.792
I won't do neither.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.674
I'll hitchhike.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.353
Girls.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.593
No crime in a
broken-down car.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.998
No crime being Negro neither.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.309
Button it up, Mary.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.389
Nobody wants to go to
jail behind your mouth.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.079
I'll do my best, sugar.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.229
Not a great place for three of
y'all be having car trouble.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.440
We didn't pick the place,
Officer. It picked us.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.113
You being disrespectful?

04:38.280 --> 04:39.679
No, sir.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.428
You have
identification on you?

04:41.600 --> 04:43.079
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.116
We're just on our way
to work...

04:47.280 --> 04:48.349
at Langley.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.879
NASA, sir.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.553
We do a great deal
of the calculating.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.392
Getting our rockets
into space.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.079
All three of you?
Yes, sir.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.240
Yes, Officer.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.720
NASA.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.074
Now that's something.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.474
I had no idea
they hired...

05:04.640 --> 05:08.235
There are quite a few women
working in the space program.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.911
Damn Russians are
watching us right now.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.914
Sputniks.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.077
You girls ever
meet those astronauts?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.639
Mercury Seven?

05:25.840 --> 05:27.239
Absolutely.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.798
Uh, yes, sir. We work with
those gentlemen all the time.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.150
Those boys are the best
we got. I'm sure of that.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.355
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.216
We gotta get a man up there
before the commies do.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.240
Yes.
Absolutely.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.776
Whole damn country's
counting on them.

05:39.800 --> 05:40.915
That's for certain.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.638
Hard being of service
broken down

05:42.760 --> 05:44.478
on the side
of the road, though.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.352
Right, right.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.192
Well, do y'all need a tow
or something?

05:48.360 --> 05:49.960
No, thank you, Officer.
I think I got it.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.189
Just give me my...

05:51.360 --> 05:54.636
Just need to bypass
the starter.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.996
She's good at this stuff.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.750
Whoo! Attagirl.

06:02.880 --> 06:03.880
We're all set.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.429
Well, hell, least I can do
is give y'all an escort.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.158
I imagine you're
running late to work.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.992
No, sir. We wouldn't
wanna bother you.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.440
That would be
wonderful, Officer.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.994
Thank you so much, sir.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.080
Follow me.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.160
I'm driving.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.016
Hurry up, Dorothy,
before he changes his mind.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.190
- We're coming.
- Hold your horses.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.096
Yes!
Whoa, slow down, Mary!

06:28.120 --> 06:29.599
Mary, slow down!
You're too close!

06:29.680 --> 06:30.816
Be quiet.
He said to follow him.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.034
He didn't mean
up his behind!

06:35.320 --> 06:37.311
Dear Lord, I don't even
know where to begin!

06:37.480 --> 06:38.833
Oh, I'll tell you
where to begin.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.634
Three Negro women are chasing
a white police officer

06:41.800 --> 06:43.552
down the highway
in Hampton, Virginia...

06:43.720 --> 06:45.551
1961.

06:45.720 --> 06:49.554
Ladies, that there
is a God-ordained miracle.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.672
And, tomorrow,
I'm riding the bus.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.758
I'm moving over

07:04.200 --> 07:06.509
I'm on a sidewalk

07:06.600 --> 07:08.431
I'm going over

07:15.400 --> 07:17.914
Lift off
is good. Trajectory is stable.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.195
Show me.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.514
No, exactly.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.955
40.349110 degrees North.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.354
Ascent angle 46. 56.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.519
Approaching
7,400 miles per hour.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.553
118 seconds.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.072
Boosters have disengaged.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.599
Second stage success.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.400
Korabl-Sputnik 4 is orbital.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.430
Orbital entry is established.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.192
Russian orbital entry
is established.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.794
Jim Webb.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.559
Yes, Mr. President.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.912
We certainly are, sir.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.912
Uh, it looks like
they've achieved

08:12.000 --> 08:13.353
at least one orbit, maybe two.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.154
Chernushka is ready
to go again.

08:18.320 --> 08:22.791
So is our comrade, Ivan,
a brave space traveler.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.599
We have proven life can
be sustained in space.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.830
Now we will be first
to send a human.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.992
A damn dog
and a damn mannequin.

08:33.440 --> 08:38.275
And then, a 1.6 megaton RDS-37
thermonuclear warhead...

08:38.919 --> 08:41.150
drops down in the middle
of Des Moines.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.720
Well, that's
a pretty big jump, sir.

08:42.799 --> 08:43.799
What?

08:43.880 --> 08:46.110
Just that...
Who the hell is he?

08:46.280 --> 08:48.316
Paul Stafford,
our lead engineer, Mr. Webb.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.680
I think what
he meant to say...

08:49.880 --> 08:52.240
is that speculation, at least
on our side of the equation...

08:52.320 --> 08:54.311
by definition can be...

08:54.480 --> 08:56.118
just a little dangerous.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.315
Dangerous?

08:57.480 --> 08:59.948
You know what's dangerous,
Mr. Stafford?

09:00.120 --> 09:02.156
Inaction and indecision.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.950
The Russians
have a spy satellite

09:05.040 --> 09:06.040
lapping the planet,

09:06.200 --> 09:08.270
taking pictures
of God knows what!

09:09.480 --> 09:11.789
The President is demanding
an immediate response.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.520
No more delay.
Alan Shepard, John Glenn,

09:13.640 --> 09:14.776
your uncle Bob,
it doesn't matter.

09:14.800 --> 09:15.869
Get us up there, Harrison.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.235
We can't justify
a space program

09:18.400 --> 09:20.675
that doesn't put
anything in space.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.471
How'd that feel
in there, Paul?

09:24.640 --> 09:26.631
You think you enlightened
the administrator?

09:27.560 --> 09:28.560
Hmm?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.870
No, he didn't look
enlightened to me.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.992
He look enlightened to you, Sam?

09:33.160 --> 09:34.229
Not particularly.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.469
And just so you know,

09:35.560 --> 09:37.136
he's not wrong about
what he said in there.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.559
You know that, right?

09:38.760 --> 09:40.432
Because now that
they can get up there,

09:40.520 --> 09:41.669
a bomb will follow.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.675
It's what happens
to all our good ideas.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.071
I imagine theirs too.
Where's...

09:47.520 --> 09:48.714
Where's the machine?

09:48.880 --> 09:49.880
Any day now,
Mr. Harrison.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.157
Any day now.
Yes, sir.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.669
What's it called?
The initials.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.034
The IBM.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.719
International Business Machines.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.553
Space is a business.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.557
I need a mathematician.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.000
I'll put in
another request, sir.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.280
"Another request."
Jesus Christ.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.556
We don't have a single person
in this entire building

10:07.720 --> 10:10.029
that can handle
analytic geometry?

10:10.200 --> 10:11.240
That's what
I've been told.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.496
Tell me something else, Ruth...

10:12.520 --> 10:13.953
like we're gonna find
such a person

10:14.120 --> 10:15.519
before the Russians
plant a flag

10:15.600 --> 10:16.600
on the damn moon.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.760
A real good time.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.000
All right, Gloria.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.680
You'll be with engineering,
building four.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.875
Ladies, ladies.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.576
If you're tardy,
you don't get an assignment.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.696
If you don't get
an assignment,

10:36.720 --> 10:37.789
you don't have a job.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.149
Eleanor.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.912
Data Reduction, building 202.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.235
Data Reduction?

10:43.400 --> 10:44.958
You're welcome
to join the charmers

10:45.080 --> 10:46.593
in Magnetoplasma Dynamics.

10:46.760 --> 10:47.909
Oh, no, ma'am.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.475
Thank you.
Data Reduction is just fine.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.153
Mm-hmm.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.559
Mary.
Present.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.154
The Mercury Seven prototype
has arrived for testing.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.276
Mr. Zielinski's
requesting you

11:00.160 --> 11:01.275
for permanent assignment.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.759
Are you serious?

11:02.920 --> 11:03.920
Get moving.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.116
Ooh, thank you, Jesus.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.395
Thank you, Jesus!

11:09.800 --> 11:11.995
Oh, thank you. Mary, Mary.
Keep it inside.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.512
Okay. I'm sorry, Dor.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.273
All right, Ms. Late.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.476
You will also be supporting
the east group.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.319
Mrs. Mitchell.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.436
We're on double-time
this morning, girls.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.909
I need these calculations
before lunch.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.353
Space Task Group
needs a computer, ASAP.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.109
Someone with a handle
on analytic geometry.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.110
We can't fill that position
out of the east group.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.429
Permanent or temp?

11:38.600 --> 11:40.955
Everything's temporary, Dorothy.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.155
You have someone?

11:42.320 --> 11:43.514
Yes, ma'am.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.631
Katherine's
the gal for that.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.950
She can handle any numbers
you put in front of her.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.439
I'll check her credentials.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.950
Didn't think I'd come
all the way down here.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.838
Here. Finish passing
those out.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yes, ma'am.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.598
Mrs. Mitchell.

12:03.760 --> 12:04.760
If I could...

12:06.320 --> 12:08.709
My application
for supervisor, ma'am.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.656
Was just wondering if they're
still considering me

12:10.680 --> 12:12.033
for that position.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.269
Yes.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.510
Well, the official
word is no.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.760
They're not assigning a permanent
supervisor for the colored group.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.879
May I ask why?

12:21.040 --> 12:22.519
I don't know why.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.199
I didn't ask why.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.918
We need a supervisor, ma'am.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.071
We haven't had one
since Miss Jansen got sick.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.593
It's been almost a year.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.352
Things are working
just fine as is.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.313
I'm doing the work
of a supervisor.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.835
Well, that's NASA for you.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.319
Fast with rocket ships,
slow with advancement.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.150
Get those trajectory
calcs worked out.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.952
We need them
for the Redstone test.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.833
Mach one tunnel test.
T-minus one minute.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.476
No shoe is worth your life.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.789
One moment.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.875
T-minus 10, 9...

13:40.040 --> 13:41.314
8...

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
7...

13:42.440 --> 13:45.273
6, 5, 4...

14:11.760 --> 14:12.954
Shut it down.

14:19.120 --> 14:23.033
If we alter the exterior
from smooth to corrugated...

14:23.200 --> 14:25.794
the capsule might have
more stability.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.236
But the friction,
it is under during re-entry...

14:29.400 --> 14:32.597
Most shield erosion occurs

14:32.760 --> 14:35.672
on the posterior side
abutting the retro-boosters.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.834
Conclusion?

14:40.640 --> 14:42.358
The area closest to the boosters

14:42.440 --> 14:43.793
is closest to the heat.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.910
Coupled with rising
temperature on re-entry...

14:47.080 --> 14:48.672
the contact softens.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.956
We could consider
another fastener

14:52.040 --> 14:53.359
other than the bolts.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.549
Yes.

14:57.840 --> 14:58.955
Yes.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.629
There is another opening

15:05.720 --> 15:07.517
in the Engineer
Training Program.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.875
Flat head rivets
would reduce wind drag.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.759
Mary, a person
with engineer's mind

15:13.840 --> 15:15.353
should be an engineer.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.360
You can't be a computer
the rest of your life.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.669
Mr. Zielinski...

15:19.400 --> 15:20.992
I'm a Negro woman.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.991
I'm not gonna entertain
the impossible.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.639
And I'm a Polish Jew

15:24.720 --> 15:26.711
whose parents died
in a Nazi prison camp.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.917
Now I'm standing
beneath a spaceship

15:30.080 --> 15:33.038
that's going to carry an
astronaut to the stars.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.676
I think we can say we are
living the impossible.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.198
Let me ask you...

15:39.360 --> 15:40.793
if you were a white male,

15:41.040 --> 15:42.393
would you wish
to be an engineer?

15:43.680 --> 15:46.956
I wouldn't have to.
I'd already be one.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.351
Skirts must be worn
past the knee.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.715
Sweaters are preferred
to blouses.

15:51.880 --> 15:52.915
No jewelry.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.116
A simple pearl necklace
is the exception.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.033
Your supervisor
is Mr. Al Harrison,

15:58.200 --> 16:00.350
Director of
the Space Task Group.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.791
You'll write research,
proof calculations, so forth.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.758
Do not talk to Mr. Harrison
unless he talks to you.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.034
Not many computers last
more than a few days.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.236
He's been through a dozen
in as many months.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.234
Come on, keep up.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.233
Things move fast
around here.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.879
Your clearance.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.834
They've never had a colored
in here before, Katherine.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.189
Don't embarrass me.

16:50.360 --> 16:51.679
This wasn't emptied
last night.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.558
I'm sorry, I'm not the...

16:54.560 --> 16:55.754
custodian.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.429
Excuse me, ma'am.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.636
Mr. Harrison's computer
reporting.

17:14.839 --> 17:17.479
Take the desk in the back.
I'll get you work in a bit.

17:20.839 --> 17:24.037
Mr. Harrison won't warm up
to you. Don't expect it.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.520
Do your work,
keep your head down.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.280
Thank you.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.512
Go on. Get settled.

17:40.840 --> 17:41.840
Paul.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.238
Why are we still
losing shingles

17:44.360 --> 17:45.554
off the heat shield?

17:45.720 --> 17:48.075
We're working with a prototype
of the capsule, Al.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.056
Its lid is one third the
size of what it's going...

17:50.080 --> 17:51.080
I get that.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.673
So, what do we do with our
million dollar fan, Karl?

17:54.880 --> 17:57.110
Turn it down?
No, Al. I don't think...

17:57.600 --> 17:58.669
It was a joke.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.917
Paul, if the heat shield
comes off...

18:02.080 --> 18:03.760
what do you think happens
to our astronaut?

18:03.840 --> 18:04.840
I know.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.080
So we're gonna come up
with a solve, right?

18:08.160 --> 18:09.320
Yes, sir.
We're working on it.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.678
Ruth, what's the status
on that computer?

18:11.840 --> 18:13.831
She's right behind you,
Mr. Harrison.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.349
Does she handle
Analytic Geometry?

18:21.520 --> 18:24.398
Absolutely.
And she speaks.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.788
Yes, sir. I do.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.558
Which one?
Both.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.199
Geometry and speaking.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.436
Ruth, get me the...

18:37.560 --> 18:38.560
You think you...

18:39.560 --> 18:41.056
You think you can find me
the Frenet frame

18:41.080 --> 18:42.080
for this data?

18:42.240 --> 18:43.514
Using the Gram-Schmidt...

18:43.640 --> 18:45.676
Orthogonalization algorithm.
Yes, sir.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.479
I prefer it over
Euclidean coordinates.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.039
Okay, good.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.120
Good, then I'm gonna need
it by the end of the day.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.275
Yes.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.589
I'm also gonna ask you

18:58.680 --> 18:59.760
to check
Mr. Stafford's math

18:59.920 --> 19:01.273
as well as others' on this floor

19:01.360 --> 19:02.429
from time to time.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
I can handle that, Al.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.637
I'm sure you can, Paul.
I'm sure they all can.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.279
But if that were the case

19:07.440 --> 19:08.976
shingles wouldn't be flying
off the heat shield,

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
now would they?

19:12.080 --> 19:13.877
Excuse me, could I have
everyone's attention

19:13.960 --> 19:15.029
for a moment?

19:17.160 --> 19:18.639
Thank you.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.799
Just to be clear...

19:20.960 --> 19:23.838
in 14 days, the Mercury Seven
will be here for training.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.833
And I have no doubt in my mind
that they're going to be

19:27.000 --> 19:28.831
asking us questions
about our work.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.119
I think that's pretty reasonable

19:31.280 --> 19:33.236
given we're putting a human
on top of a missile,

19:33.440 --> 19:34.440
shooting him into space,

19:34.600 --> 19:35.953
and it's never been
done before.

19:37.680 --> 19:38.840
Because it's never been done,

19:38.920 --> 19:41.309
everything we do between now
and then is gonna matter.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.552
It's gonna matter
to their wives...

19:45.760 --> 19:47.273
to their children.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.080
I believe it's gonna matter
to the whole damn country.

19:51.560 --> 19:55.109
So this Space Task Group
will be as advertised.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.511
America's greatest engineering
and scientific minds

19:58.840 --> 20:00.239
are not gonna have a problem

20:00.320 --> 20:02.754
with having their work checked.
Are they, Paul?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.195
No, sir.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.271
Good. So let's have
an amen, damn it.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.440
Amen.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.150
Amen!

20:10.880 --> 20:11.949
All right.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.158
My numbers are spot on.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.075
I will double check them, sir.
No problem.

20:54.560 --> 20:55.560
Uh...

20:55.760 --> 20:57.776
I'm not gonna be able to...
Work on what you can read.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.553
The rest is classified.
You don't have clearance.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.915
These are the numbers
Mr. Harrison gave me.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.036
Yes, I'm absolutely...
Excuse me.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.679
May I ask
where the ladies' room is?

21:23.880 --> 21:26.348
Sorry. I have no idea
where your bathroom is.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.639
Yes, sir.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.197
Uh, yes, sir.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.794
Summertime in
Virginia was an oven

22:04.960 --> 22:07.110
All the kids eating
ice cream with their cousins

22:08.240 --> 22:10.834
I was studyin' while you
was playing the dozens

22:11.920 --> 22:14.514
Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't

22:14.600 --> 22:16.318
Runnin' from the man

22:16.400 --> 22:17.628
Runnin' from the badge

22:18.880 --> 22:21.155
Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't

22:21.520 --> 22:23.158
Runnin' toward our plans

22:23.240 --> 22:24.673
And the judges hands

22:25.800 --> 22:27.836
Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't

22:28.920 --> 22:31.514
I know they say
you crawl before you walk

22:32.360 --> 22:35.113
But in my mind I already jog

22:35.760 --> 22:38.638
If I stand still
I cannot get far

22:39.320 --> 22:41.436
They want the moon
I'm on Mars

22:41.520 --> 22:46.833
Sometime my mind dives deep
when I'm runnin'

22:48.560 --> 22:53.588
Together we'll fly
But no more runnin'

22:55.040 --> 22:56.040
Ruth!

22:56.200 --> 22:57.200
Yes, Mr. Harrison?

22:57.800 --> 22:59.995
Ruth, where's that girl
with the numbers?

23:00.160 --> 23:02.276
On a... break.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.435
We take breaks now?

23:06.720 --> 23:11.714
Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'

23:12.840 --> 23:15.400
I don't want no free ride

23:16.160 --> 23:18.799
I'm just sick and tired
of runnin'

23:20.240 --> 23:25.075
Together we fly
But no more runnin'

23:32.320 --> 23:33.514
My God, where have you been?

23:33.720 --> 23:34.869
Are you finished yet?

23:35.040 --> 23:36.075
Uh...

23:36.160 --> 23:37.832
Almost. He said
by the end of the day.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.797
The end of the day around
here was yesterday.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.474
I need those done first.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.993
He wants those done first.
Okay.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.160
Get going.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.429
I'm sorry about that.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.839
Somebody's working on it
right now.

24:54.680 --> 24:55.749
Mr. Harrison.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.591
Yeah. Uh, Just set it...
You know.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.830
And Stafford's
heat shield calcs?

25:06.240 --> 25:07.992
It's hard
to be sure, sir.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.153
Hard to be sure.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.638
You know
what we're doing here?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.191
Trying to put
a man into space, sir.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.554
That's right.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.480
That's right. So you can
throw that in the trash.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.914
Excuse me?

25:22.640 --> 25:24.596
I said you can throw it away.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.120
Here.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.719
It's not an insult
to your work.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.433
It's just obsolete.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.830
That's how fast things
are moving around here.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.355
If I said I was sorry,
I'd be saying it all day.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.309
What I'm asking you to do,

25:37.400 --> 25:38.960
what I'm asking everyone
in that room...

25:39.120 --> 25:41.190
all my geniuses...

25:41.360 --> 25:43.032
is to look
beyond the numbers.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.876
To look around them.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.678
Through them.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.070
For answers to questions
we don't even know to ask.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.916
Math that
doesn't yet exist.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.829
Because without it,
we're not going anywhere.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.752
We're staying on the ground.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.480
We're not flying into space.
We're not circling the Earth.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.358
And we're certainly not
touching the Moon.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.714
And in my mind...

26:04.920 --> 26:07.275
In my mind, I'm already there.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.520
Are you?

26:12.080 --> 26:13.229
Yes, sir.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.388
Good.

26:15.560 --> 26:16.936
Because I don't need
another smart girl

26:16.960 --> 26:18.188
with an adding machine.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.873
Can I go, sir?

26:26.240 --> 26:27.958
Yeah, go.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.639
Yes, you can go.

27:01.920 --> 27:05.151
We've been waiting for hours.
Next time, you take the bus.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.548
She's in a mood.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.837
People talkin'
tryin' to break us up

27:12.240 --> 27:15.118
Why won't they let us be?

27:15.240 --> 27:17.754
Brick and stones
may break my bones

27:17.840 --> 27:19.831
But talk don't bother me

27:19.920 --> 27:23.037
I've been abused

27:23.160 --> 27:24.559
In my heart

27:25.200 --> 27:27.555
I haven't been late
one day in 10 years.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.359
Haven't been out sick.
Haven't complained.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.520
My work's on time.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.999
It's done right.
It's done well.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.513
It's not fair,
that's a fact.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.193
What's not fair
is having

27:36.280 --> 27:37.416
the responsibility
of a supervisor...

27:37.440 --> 27:39.237
- but not the title or the pay.
- Mmm.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.229
Watching you two move on.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.997
Now, don't get me wrong.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.720
Any upward movement
is movement for us all.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.877
Just isn't movement for me.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.040
Truth be told, Dorothy...

27:51.200 --> 27:53.430
I don't even know
if I can keep up in that room.

27:54.360 --> 27:56.874
I'll be back with
the computers in a week.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.792
Or out of a job entirely.

27:58.960 --> 27:59.995
Oh, please.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.816
You're better with the numbers
than anyone in there,

28:01.840 --> 28:02.920
Katherine, and you know it.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.136
Just make that pencil move
as fast as your mind does...

28:05.160 --> 28:06.639
you'll be fine.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.677
And you,
have some respect.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.478
Get your damn feet
off my dashboard.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.680
This isn't your living room.

28:16.040 --> 28:17.792
I sound like a supervisor,
don't I?

28:17.960 --> 28:19.518
A mean old salty one.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.511
Riddled with authority,
no question.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.752
You don't mess
with Mrs. Vaughan.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.439
Turn that music up.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.120
Good night,
Katherine.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.240
Bye, Kat.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.320
Good night, ladies.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.720
- See you in the morning.
- Bye.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.560
Hey, baby.

28:58.720 --> 28:59.789
Hello, Mama.

29:00.400 --> 29:03.119
I was fixing to call
the National Guard.

29:04.280 --> 29:07.909
Sorry, Mama.
New assignment.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.877
Space Task Group.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.031
Oh, my word.
That sounds important.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.872
It's a promotion?

29:14.200 --> 29:16.873
It might be
a slight promotion.

29:17.680 --> 29:18.999
But you want the job, right?

29:20.920 --> 29:22.478
I think so.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.392
It's a challenge, but...

29:24.520 --> 29:26.636
It's nothing you
can't handle, Katherine.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.238
Thank you, Mama.

29:31.840 --> 29:32.909
Are they asleep yet?

29:33.120 --> 29:34.712
They're pretending to be.

29:34.880 --> 29:37.030
- What are you doing?
- I don't...

29:37.200 --> 29:38.872
They're not pretending
well enough.

29:38.960 --> 29:39.960
Constance!

29:40.040 --> 29:41.917
Thank you, Mama.
Love you.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.433
This is my bed.
No.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.520
Get off!

29:44.600 --> 29:45.999
Go back to yours!
I'm oldest! No.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.376
- What are you doing?
- Get off!

29:47.400 --> 29:48.628
What are you doing?

29:48.800 --> 29:51.360
It's not fair how Joylette
gets to sleep by herself

29:51.560 --> 29:53.198
because she's the oldest.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.793
Yes, it is fair.
No, it's not.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.456
- Yes, it is.
- Nuh-uh.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.710
Constance, Kathy, sit.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.030
Now, I understand...

30:05.240 --> 30:07.913
you want to be grown
and have your own space.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.756
So, whoever sleeps
in that bed,

30:10.880 --> 30:12.472
in Joylette's place...

30:12.640 --> 30:14.392
will also do the dishes...

30:14.560 --> 30:16.312
take out the trash...

30:16.480 --> 30:18.436
and do all of
Joylette's chores.

30:19.120 --> 30:21.429
That's okay. Never mind.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.318
Yeah, she's not so
terrible to share with.

30:25.680 --> 30:26.680
Okay.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.159
Then don't let me
come home

30:28.240 --> 30:30.276
and find you like
this again, you hear me?

30:30.440 --> 30:32.908
You're supposed to been
asleep a long time ago.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.593
We just wanted
to say goodnight.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.320
You've been gone
for 300 hours.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.636
I know. I work a
full-time job now.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.313
You all know that.

30:45.280 --> 30:48.078
I have to be Mommy and Daddy.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.511
I miss your father
just as much as anyone.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.475
He's with the angels.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.596
Yes, he's with
all the angels.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.432
And he's watching over us.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.875
Every minute, okay?

31:04.040 --> 31:06.429
That's why we have
to be strong.

31:06.520 --> 31:07.520
All right?

31:07.600 --> 31:08.953
Yes, Mama.
Yes, Mama.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.473
Y'all get some rest, okay?

31:11.040 --> 31:12.040
Mama?

31:12.120 --> 31:13.120
Yes, baby?

31:13.720 --> 31:16.029
Are the Russians fixin'
to attack us?

31:16.640 --> 31:17.789
Where'd you
get that from?

31:17.960 --> 31:19.480
We had to hide under
our desks today...

31:20.320 --> 31:21.389
all scrunched up.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.036
Okay, baby,
that's called a drill.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.679
It means, uh...

31:25.840 --> 31:27.319
you practice safety

31:27.400 --> 31:29.789
just in case something happens.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.233
Truth is, we don't know
what they're doing up there.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.879
You going to space, too?

31:37.080 --> 31:38.479
No, baby.

31:38.640 --> 31:41.791
But I'm going to do
what I can

31:42.000 --> 31:44.992
to help those brave men
get there. Yes, I am.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.993
You could fly up to space
if you wanted to, Mama.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.639
You could be an astronaut.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.717
Did you draw this?
Yes, Mama.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.031
Is that me?

31:55.200 --> 31:56.200
Mmm-hmm.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.069
You see this?

31:59.560 --> 32:01.152
Oh, my goodness.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.912
I love you, baby.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
I know.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.559
Come here.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.075
All right. Now this time
really go to bed.

32:09.680 --> 32:10.680
Okay?

32:10.840 --> 32:12.558
I love y'all.
Good night.

32:12.720 --> 32:13.840
Good night.
Good night, Mama.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.836
I love my picture, baby.

32:24.600 --> 32:25.715
Thank you, Lord.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.071
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

32:30.240 --> 32:32.356
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

32:34.520 --> 32:35.520
Hallelujah.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.359
Praise God...

32:39.360 --> 32:42.079
that change is coming.

32:44.080 --> 32:47.390
From the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference...

32:47.560 --> 32:49.551
to the good reverend
Dr. King...

32:49.720 --> 32:51.039
Amen!
Hallelujah!

32:51.200 --> 32:53.395
...to the students sitting in
at lunch counters

32:53.480 --> 32:54.480
in North Carolina.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.640
That's right.
Yes, sir.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.593
His faith in us
has no limit.

32:59.320 --> 33:02.596
The good Lord
has our very own women

33:02.760 --> 33:04.398
working on rocket ships.

33:08.560 --> 33:11.597
And we have National Guardsmen

33:11.800 --> 33:12.949
defending our freedom.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.395
Give a shout of praise
for Colonel Jim Johnson.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.071
Returning home,
by the grace of God

33:20.240 --> 33:22.595
to set up
a National Guard unit

33:22.960 --> 33:24.234
right here in Hampton.

33:25.240 --> 33:26.673
Can I get a hallelujah in here?

33:26.840 --> 33:28.831
Hallelujah!

33:33.080 --> 33:34.479
I just don't understand.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.633
I don't understand it.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.440
I don't wanna talk
about this again, okay?

33:38.840 --> 33:40.193
A female engineer?

33:41.360 --> 33:42.360
A female engineer?

33:42.920 --> 33:44.035
We're Negro, baby.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.480
Ain't no such thing.
Understand it.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.953
It's not like that
there, Levi.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.439
You can't apply for freedom.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.319
Freedom is never granted
to the oppressed.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.993
It's got
to be demanded. Taken.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.991
Stop quoting your slogans at me.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.795
There is more than one way
to achieve something.

33:57.960 --> 33:58.960
I don't want any greens.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.956
Hey. I tell you
about interrupting?

34:01.040 --> 34:02.792
Here. Try this, baby.

34:04.880 --> 34:05.880
Yes.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.757
You're gonna eat
them greens, too.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.795
Kids need
to eat their vegetables.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.678
You'd know that
if you was ever home.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.951
You better settle down,
Levi Jackson.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.792
Unless you want
this female's mind,

34:17.880 --> 34:19.871
right here,
in front of everybody.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.393
All I'm saying...

34:23.560 --> 34:25.312
don't play the fool.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.311
I don't wanna
see you get hurt.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.391
NASA's never ever
given you guys your due.

34:29.560 --> 34:30.913
Having a couple
of extra degrees

34:31.000 --> 34:32.149
ain't gonna change that.

34:33.679 --> 34:35.830
Civil rights
ain't always civil.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.152
I don't want
any greens either.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.355
No lip, little miss.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.040
Your brother gets them,
and so do you.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.395
I hear he's planning
on staying in the area.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.751
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's good for him.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.388
Katherine, go find
your way over there.

34:57.560 --> 35:00.597
That Colonel Jim
is a tall glass of water.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.034
That he is.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.754
Tall, strong, commanding.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.195
And I bet he's like that
day and night.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.954
Mary, it's Sunday.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.439
Please have some shame.

35:11.600 --> 35:12.874
I will not.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.068
Hmm, I think he's
smiling over here.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.434
At you.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.108
Well I'm not smiling back.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.235
Yes, you are.
Oh, child.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.151
You are all teeth right now.
I am not.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.588
Come over here.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.080
He's coming over.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.576
Now, why would
he be doing that?

35:31.600 --> 35:33.280
- 'Cause Mary's waving at him.
- No!

35:33.400 --> 35:35.096
Ladies, I'm not ready.
It's too late. Fix your hair.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.120
Hello, Colonel.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.394
I'm Dorothy Vaughan.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.696
That's Mary Jackson.
I believe you met her husband, Levi.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.233
Yes, ma'am.
Good to meet y'all.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.753
And Mrs. Katherine Goble.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.717
She's not married.
She's a widow...

35:45.880 --> 35:48.075
...with three beautiful
little girls.

35:48.240 --> 35:49.240
So well behaved.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.550
Angels on earth is what
we like to call them.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.392
Dorothy, slice of pie?

35:53.560 --> 35:55.073
I'd love one.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.719
Excuse me.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.056
You already have
a slice of pie...

35:58.080 --> 35:59.080
Uh-huh.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.399
I was just, uh, fixing my
three babies some plates...

36:05.600 --> 36:06.794
Let me help you.

36:07.760 --> 36:08.988
Sure.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.151
Fruit salad.
Mmm-hmm.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.518
Pastor mentioned you're
a computer at NASA.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.600
Yes.

36:16.640 --> 36:17.993
What's that entail?

36:18.600 --> 36:19.600
Oh.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.911
We calculate
the mathematics necessary

36:22.080 --> 36:24.640
to enable launch and landing
for the space program.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.309
That's pretty heady stuff.

36:27.480 --> 36:28.515
Yes, it is.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.398
They let women
handle that sort of...

36:30.480 --> 36:31.480
Uh...

36:33.600 --> 36:35.989
That's not what I mean.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.479
What do you mean?

36:40.360 --> 36:43.591
I'm just surprised
that something so...

36:45.440 --> 36:46.714
taxing...
Mmm-hmm.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.313
Mr. Johnson.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.635
If I were you,
I'd quit talking right now.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.028
I didn't mean
no disrespect.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.554
I will have you know

36:55.720 --> 36:57.790
I was the first
Negro female student

36:57.960 --> 37:00.155
at West Virginia University
Graduate School.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.108
On any given day...

37:02.320 --> 37:04.390
I analyze the manometer levels

37:04.480 --> 37:06.948
for air displacement,
friction, and velocity

37:07.160 --> 37:09.594
and compute
over 10,000 calculations

37:09.680 --> 37:11.398
by cosine, square root...

37:11.560 --> 37:13.596
and, lately, analytic geometry.

37:13.680 --> 37:14.680
By hand.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.760
There are 20 bright,
highly capable

37:17.880 --> 37:19.677
Negro women
in the West Computing Group.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.314
And we're proud to be doing
our part for the country.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.160
So, yes.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.709
They let women do some things
at NASA, Mr. Johnson.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.675
And it's not because
we wear skirts.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.231
It's because
we wear glasses.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.879
Have a good day.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.194
Scott, welcome to Langley.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.675
Welcome to Langley.
Welcome.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.192
Good to have
you here, gentlemen.

38:04.280 --> 38:05.554
Thank you.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.399
That's Alan Shepard,
U.S. Navy pilot.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.391
He could be the
first man in space.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.239
And that's Scott Carpenter
and Walter Schirra...

38:13.400 --> 38:14.958
also Navy pilots.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.873
All under 5'11", 180 pounds.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.632
IQs over 130.
Mmm.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.711
And handsome must be
a requirement too.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.599
How could you possibly be
ogling these white men?

38:24.760 --> 38:25.760
It's equal rights.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.871
I have the right to see
fine in every color.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.190
And that's John Glenn.
He's the only Marine Corps pilot.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.876
Gentlemen, if we may,
much to see around here.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.960
Well, heck, we haven't
shaken all the hands yet.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.640
We have a fairly tight
itinerary, Colonel.

38:38.720 --> 38:39.720
Ruth, he's fine.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.216
He's coming this way.
Look straight ahead.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.240
I'm looking right at him.

38:42.400 --> 38:45.392
Ladies, I didn't wanna run
off without saying hello.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.073
Seem to be in a big
rush around here.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.151
The Russians certainly
aren't slowing down any.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.912
They can't build
a damn refrigerator.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.600
How the heck did they
beat us into space?

38:53.920 --> 38:55.216
And what do you ladies do
for NASA?

38:55.240 --> 38:57.800
Calculate your trajectories.
Launch and landing.

38:57.920 --> 38:58.976
You can't get anywhere
without the numbers.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
No, sir.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.956
Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.
Engineering.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.576
And I'm proud as the devil
to be working with you.

39:05.600 --> 39:06.749
Thank you, Mary.

39:06.840 --> 39:07.840
John.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.758
John, let's take it inside.
Yes, sir.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.558
Guys.
Nice meeting you guys.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.200
Thank you, Colonel.
Good luck, sir.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.599
God bless you all.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.794
Thank you. That's wonderful.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.600
Thank you!

39:50.120 --> 39:51.519
Mr. Harrison wants you
to confirm

39:51.680 --> 39:54.319
launch and landing for the
Redstone rocket test.

39:59.320 --> 40:02.551
I cannot work on what
I cannot see, Mr. Stafford.

40:02.720 --> 40:03.789
It's illegible.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.600
Those numbers have
already been confirmed

40:05.680 --> 40:07.557
by two engineers in this
department and myself.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.756
This is more or less
a dummy check.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.360
You have one, we make it two.
Make it double, okay?

40:48.400 --> 40:50.197
We gotta get it.
Just make it happen.

40:53.040 --> 40:55.235
No one thought to measure
these things?

40:55.400 --> 40:57.038
I'm afraid not, sir.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.556
Well, would you
like us to stop?

41:00.720 --> 41:02.711
No. No, just...

41:03.360 --> 41:05.794
Actually, no.
Just keep going.

41:06.800 --> 41:09.439
In fact, use the
big hammer.

41:09.600 --> 41:10.600
Yes, sir.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.856
Come on, use the big hammer.
You heard the man. Let's go.

41:12.880 --> 41:13.880
Watch out.

41:39.920 --> 41:40.920
Ma'am.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.510
Our runner can pick up
your work, Dorothy.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.152
You need to be working,
not walking.

41:48.320 --> 41:51.596
Oh, it's break time, ma'am.
No trouble at all.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.432
Since you made the trip...

41:53.600 --> 41:55.716
you can take that batch
over there.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.277
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.475
You need something else?
Yes, ma'am.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.976
I was wondering if you know
what they're building

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
over in the tech wing.

42:09.880 --> 42:11.950
It's called an IBM.

42:12.120 --> 42:13.599
A mainframe machine.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.833
Apparently, it can
do our calculations

42:15.960 --> 42:17.000
in a fraction of the time.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.680
Hmm.

42:19.280 --> 42:20.952
I guess that's good for NASA.

42:24.360 --> 42:26.476
Hurry on, now.
Best if you do it in one trip.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.229
Excuse me.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.440
Hi.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.752
What are you
looking at, Paul?

43:30.080 --> 43:31.513
Is that correct?

43:32.960 --> 43:33.960
Yeah.

43:40.760 --> 43:41.795
Whose work is that?

43:44.040 --> 43:45.871
I said, whose work is that?

43:48.880 --> 43:50.472
Katherine Goble, sir.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.360
Hello.
Hi.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.456
How did you know
the Redstone

43:56.480 --> 43:58.038
couldn't support orbital flight?

43:58.200 --> 43:59.376
That's classified information.

43:59.400 --> 44:00.400
It's top secret.

44:01.040 --> 44:03.235
It's no secret why the
Redstone tests keep failing.

44:03.400 --> 44:04.879
It's fine
for sub-orbital flight

44:05.040 --> 44:07.076
but it can't handle
the weight of the capsule

44:07.240 --> 44:08.240
and push it into space.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.393
Numbers don't lie.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.311
And you figured
all that out with this?

44:15.080 --> 44:16.911
Half the data is redacted.

44:17.800 --> 44:21.156
But what's there tells a story
if you read between the lines.

44:21.320 --> 44:23.000
The distance from launch
to orbit, we know.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.354
Redstone mass, we know.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.396
Mercury capsule weight, we know.

44:26.600 --> 44:29.398
And the speeds are there
in the data.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.238
You did the math.

44:31.640 --> 44:32.640
Yes, sir.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.271
I looked beyond.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.749
How do you know
about the Atlas rocket?

44:42.760 --> 44:44.751
That's not math.

44:44.920 --> 44:45.989
That data is not here.

44:46.120 --> 44:47.792
Like you said, it's classified.

44:53.960 --> 44:55.757
I held it up to the light.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.279
You held it up
to the light?

44:57.440 --> 44:58.509
Yes, sir.

45:03.800 --> 45:04.800
Well, there it is.

45:04.960 --> 45:05.960
Mmm-hmm.

45:07.280 --> 45:08.280
Atlas.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.269
What's your name?

45:10.440 --> 45:11.953
Katherine Goble.

45:13.280 --> 45:14.633
Are you a spy, Katherine?

45:14.800 --> 45:15.800
Am I what?

45:15.840 --> 45:17.040
I said, are you a Russian spy?

45:17.120 --> 45:18.473
No, sir.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.993
I'm not Russian.

45:21.520 --> 45:23.158
She's not Russian, sir.

45:24.960 --> 45:26.791
All right then, we have
nothing to lose here.

45:26.960 --> 45:28.016
Give her everything she needs

45:28.040 --> 45:29.296
to work on Shepard's
trajectories.

45:29.320 --> 45:31.390
Without redaction.
Are we clear on that?

45:31.560 --> 45:32.834
Are we sure about this?

45:33.040 --> 45:34.040
What's the issue, Paul?

45:34.200 --> 45:35.633
You heard her.

45:35.800 --> 45:36.800
She's not a spy.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.232
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

45:39.400 --> 45:43.075
You know what I think's
a good idea? Darker ink.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.520
I think darker ink's
a good idea.

45:44.640 --> 45:45.736
Ruth, could you
pass it along?

45:45.760 --> 45:46.760
Yes, sir.

45:46.920 --> 45:47.989
Thank you, Katherine.

45:48.160 --> 45:49.309
Thank you, sir.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.831
This interrogation's over.

46:16.400 --> 46:18.550
You can probably get to the
moon and back with this.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.119
Just not the bathroom.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.430
At least they're not
blind of what you do.

46:22.600 --> 46:23.680
It's not gonna matter soon.

46:23.880 --> 46:26.474
This IBM's gonna
put us all out of work.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.551
How you doing?
What can we do about it?

46:29.280 --> 46:31.271
Only one thing to do.

46:31.440 --> 46:33.158
Learn all we can,
make ourselves valuable.

46:33.760 --> 46:35.216
Somewhere down the line,
a human being

46:35.240 --> 46:36.536
is gonna have
to push the buttons.

46:36.560 --> 46:37.959
That's right.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.718
Oh, mercy.

46:41.880 --> 46:43.472
Well, she must be lost.

46:43.640 --> 46:44.856
NASA doesn't commission females

46:44.880 --> 46:46.200
for the Engineer
Training Program.

46:47.400 --> 46:51.109
That position is available
to any qualified applicant.

46:51.280 --> 46:54.078
Right. Except, you don't have
the educational requirements.

46:54.240 --> 46:55.309
I have a bachelor's degree

46:55.400 --> 46:56.736
in mathematics
and physical science.

46:56.760 --> 46:58.637
It's the same as most
engineers around here.

46:58.800 --> 47:01.314
We now require advanced
extension courses

47:01.400 --> 47:02.913
through the University
of Virginia.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.275
It's in the employee
handbook. In addendum.

47:06.560 --> 47:07.680
In case you haven't read it.

47:08.320 --> 47:10.470
Every time we have a chance
to get ahead...

47:10.680 --> 47:11.829
they move the finish line.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.400
I just follow the rules
around here.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.113
And I expect everyone
who works for me

47:15.240 --> 47:16.240
to follow them as well.

47:16.400 --> 47:19.597
There are no special
circumstances for anyone.

47:20.080 --> 47:22.230
Y'all should be thankful
you have jobs at all.

47:28.080 --> 47:31.550
"For those that cannot attend classes
at the University of Virginia...

47:31.720 --> 47:34.109
"advanced extension courses
are available

47:34.280 --> 47:36.077
"at the Hampton High School."

47:36.800 --> 47:39.075
That's still a
segregated school, Mary.

47:39.240 --> 47:41.708
Virginia acts like Brown
versus Board of Education

47:41.800 --> 47:42.800
never happened.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.275
They are never gonna
allow a colored woman

47:45.440 --> 47:47.431
to just take classes
at an all-white school.

47:47.600 --> 47:49.397
Well, sounds about right.

47:49.560 --> 47:51.278
That's all you gonna say?

47:51.360 --> 47:53.096
I'm not gonna sit here all day
and listen to you complain

47:53.120 --> 47:54.314
about the way things are.

47:54.480 --> 47:55.560
We're trying to play cards.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.296
Petition the court.
Fight for what you want.

47:57.320 --> 47:58.799
But quit talking about it.

48:01.800 --> 48:03.438
I've been complaining?
For days.

48:03.600 --> 48:04.600
Ladies.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.916
Not one more peep
about work.

48:08.080 --> 48:09.149
Deal me in.

48:09.280 --> 48:10.280
Katherine?

48:10.320 --> 48:11.719
- Come on.
- Oh, no.

48:11.840 --> 48:12.909
Right here.
You.

48:13.080 --> 48:14.957
Child, I needed this.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.160
Thank you.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.835
Don't give her
anymore, Katherine.

48:21.040 --> 48:23.156
I can't. She drank it all.

48:23.320 --> 48:25.595
Listen, I'm fine.

48:25.760 --> 48:27.637
I'm as fine
as I have ever been.

48:27.840 --> 48:29.592
You're drunk
as you've ever been.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.513
Come on. Let's dance, ladies.

48:34.160 --> 48:35.434
Come on, Kat. Let's dance.

48:35.640 --> 48:36.920
Go and dance with her,
Katherine.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.393
Come on.
Get out here.

48:38.480 --> 48:39.595
Hide that.

48:39.680 --> 48:40.776
We gonna teach you
how to dance.

48:40.800 --> 48:41.800
You go ahead.

48:41.880 --> 48:43.836
All right.
It's too low.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.638
We gonna teach you
how to get a man.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.631
- Teach me? What?
- That's right. Come on!

48:47.720 --> 48:49.358
You got to know
how to dance.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.999
Slow. Slow.
Come on.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.116
Twirl it around.
Twirl, twirl.

48:53.320 --> 48:55.436
Yes!
Twirl, twirl, twirl.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.192
Whoo! Look at her,
Dorothy.

48:57.360 --> 48:59.351
Can I win me one of those
fancy dance contests?

48:59.520 --> 49:00.794
Whip it around.

49:02.800 --> 49:04.376
Yeah, and on the outside.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.674
Was it better than Mama's?

49:05.880 --> 49:07.154
No, not really.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.840
Segregation must go!

49:09.240 --> 49:12.710
Segregation must go!

49:12.880 --> 49:14.916
Segregation must go!

49:15.080 --> 49:16.877
Segregation must go!

49:21.160 --> 49:22.376
Don't pay attention
to all that.

49:22.400 --> 49:23.880
We're not part
of that trouble. Go on.

49:35.680 --> 49:37.875
"Mind. They must have done..."

49:42.240 --> 49:44.549
We don't want any trouble
in here.

49:45.240 --> 49:47.356
Oh, I'm not here
for any trouble, ma'am.

49:47.520 --> 49:48.589
What are you here for?

49:49.400 --> 49:50.400
A book.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.915
You have books
in the colored section.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.912
It doesn't have
what I'm looking for.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.230
That's just
the way it is.

50:02.400 --> 50:03.736
Go on, now.
You know better than this.

50:03.760 --> 50:06.069
Get your hands off my boys!
Don't touch them.

50:07.280 --> 50:09.032
You have a blessed day.

50:17.560 --> 50:20.916
Separate and equal
are two different things.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.634
Just 'cause it's the way,
doesn't make it right.

50:23.800 --> 50:24.915
Understand?

50:25.960 --> 50:26.960
Yes, Mama.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.275
You act right, you are right.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.078
That's for certain.

50:31.240 --> 50:32.240
Understand?

50:32.400 --> 50:33.435
Yes, Mama.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.312
You took that book, Mama?

50:41.480 --> 50:43.436
Son, I pay taxes.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.631
And taxes pay for everything
in that library.

50:45.800 --> 50:47.791
Can't take something
you already paid for.

50:52.480 --> 50:55.950
"Fortran is a new
and exciting language...

50:56.120 --> 50:59.476
"used by programmers
to communicate with computers.

50:59.640 --> 51:02.950
"It is exciting, as it is
the wave of the future."

51:03.960 --> 51:05.439
All right, everybody smile.

51:05.520 --> 51:07.080
- Everybody smile.
- Aw!

51:10.480 --> 51:11.480
Make a wish.
Make a wish.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.119
Blow. Try again.

51:13.280 --> 51:14.793
There you go.

51:16.040 --> 51:17.951
Leonard, you need
to get you a job now.

51:18.080 --> 51:19.080
Two jobs.

51:20.360 --> 51:21.856
Your baby is nine.
What are you gonna do?

51:21.880 --> 51:23.496
Thank you, man.
Yeah, you're just in time.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.839
Look at that.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.991
Look at what?
What a surprise.

51:27.160 --> 51:28.673
Can't complain, man.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.472
I'll say.

51:31.680 --> 51:33.671
Howard must have invited him.
Mmm-hmm.

51:34.200 --> 51:36.555
Let me go help them
with those flowers.

51:46.240 --> 51:48.151
Walter, you behave yourself.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.788
Now, you know,
I'm just... Yeah.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.398
That's right, baby.
Shake it.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.191
Yeah. There you go.

52:00.840 --> 52:03.195
Good to see you.
Yes. Thank you.

52:11.760 --> 52:13.876
I believe
I owe you an apology.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.509
Well, was that it?

52:19.240 --> 52:20.992
Can I make it
while we dance?

52:33.040 --> 52:35.600
I'm afraid I simply misspoke
the other day, Mrs. Goble.

52:37.880 --> 52:40.110
I've been away
for a long time.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.873
I imagine I'm just
out of practice.

52:44.560 --> 52:45.754
Mmm-hmm.

52:46.360 --> 52:48.794
I was hoping you'd allow
me to start over.

52:50.240 --> 52:51.240
Mmm-hmm.

52:52.040 --> 52:53.598
See, the thing is...

52:53.760 --> 52:55.680
I have an interest in
getting to know you better.

52:56.280 --> 52:57.280
Mmm-hmm.

52:59.280 --> 53:00.920
You're one
tough customer, huh?

53:03.440 --> 53:05.158
You haven't said
you're sorry yet.

53:05.320 --> 53:06.548
Right.

53:06.720 --> 53:07.755
Of course.

53:11.880 --> 53:13.757
I'm sorry, Katherine.

53:13.960 --> 53:15.109
For what, Jim?

53:15.920 --> 53:17.717
Underestimating you.

53:18.600 --> 53:20.397
And any other woman
like you...

53:22.560 --> 53:24.755
Though I don't imagine
there's many.

53:26.800 --> 53:28.950
That's good practice,
right there.

53:32.120 --> 53:33.736
We interrupt
this musical programming

53:33.760 --> 53:35.478
with breaking news.

53:35.640 --> 53:37.790
The Soviet news agency
has announced

53:37.960 --> 53:39.996
that Russian cosmonaut,
Yuri Gagarin,

53:40.120 --> 53:42.315
has become
the first man in space.

53:42.480 --> 53:43.480
Gagarin completed

53:43.600 --> 53:44.840
one full orbit
around the planet

53:45.000 --> 53:47.150
in 108 minutes.

53:47.320 --> 53:49.000
Stay tuned to this station
for more details

53:49.160 --> 53:50.479
as they become available.

53:51.800 --> 53:53.995
Guess that puts us
behind the curve.

53:54.160 --> 53:55.480
The Vostok-1 rocket...

53:55.520 --> 53:58.796
delivered Russian cosmonaut
Yuri Gagarin's 3KA capsule...

53:58.960 --> 54:00.837
into orbit, at 6:07 UTC...

54:01.640 --> 54:05.349
Reentering Russian airspace
at 7: 55 UTC.

54:05.520 --> 54:07.078
Proving conclusively that man

54:07.160 --> 54:08.798
could survive
orbital space flight.

54:09.200 --> 54:10.519
Gagarin was awarded

54:10.680 --> 54:12.016
the Order of Lenin
and a Gold Star...

54:12.040 --> 54:13.837
Well, they beat
the pants off us.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.115
Let's go.

54:15.280 --> 54:16.336
He is also conferred
the title...

54:16.360 --> 54:17.600
Let's learn how to fly
to space.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.875
"First Soviet Astronaut"...

54:20.040 --> 54:22.838
and has been proclaimed
a national hero.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.958
This is a day
of unprecedented triumph...

54:26.120 --> 54:27.872
for the Russian
space program

54:28.040 --> 54:30.270
and a crushing blow
for America

54:30.360 --> 54:32.351
in the race for space.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.351
I wanna thank everyone
for staying.

54:35.520 --> 54:37.670
I know it's late.
And after what I just saw,

54:37.840 --> 54:40.479
I'm sure everyone's probably
anxious to just go home.

54:40.920 --> 54:43.229
Before we do, I just
have to ask a question.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.717
The same one

54:46.840 --> 54:48.656
I've been asking myself
all the way over here...

54:48.680 --> 54:49.715
which is...

54:51.600 --> 54:53.079
How the hell did
we find ourself

54:53.200 --> 54:55.077
in second place
in a two-man race?

54:55.880 --> 54:56.880
Anybody?

54:57.880 --> 54:58.880
Paul?

55:00.400 --> 55:01.880
And I think Glenn said it
pretty well.

55:02.040 --> 55:03.120
They're just outworking us.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.430
The reason
I have to think that

55:05.600 --> 55:06.696
is because I refuse
to believe

55:06.720 --> 55:08.278
that the Russians
are smarter than us

55:08.440 --> 55:09.953
or that they have
more technology,

55:10.040 --> 55:11.553
or that they care more.

55:13.280 --> 55:15.111
But I don't know.
Is that possible?

55:16.360 --> 55:17.634
Is it possible
that it actually

55:17.720 --> 55:19.233
means more to them?

55:20.760 --> 55:23.911
We're in the fight
of our lives, people.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.389
We're not on
some epic joy ride.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.232
I just saw seven faces

55:28.560 --> 55:30.391
who aren't sure
that we can get there.

55:34.920 --> 55:36.717
This is our problem.

55:37.560 --> 55:39.073
And so as of right now

55:41.040 --> 55:43.056
there's only two things you
need to know going forward.

55:43.080 --> 55:44.593
One is staying here,
working late,

55:44.720 --> 55:45.920
that's gonna be
a fact of life.

55:47.120 --> 55:48.599
And two, don't expect
your paychecks

55:48.720 --> 55:50.256
to reflect the extra time
it's gonna take

55:50.280 --> 55:52.236
to catch up
and pass those bastards.

55:54.160 --> 55:55.736
For those of you
who can't work that way,

55:55.760 --> 55:58.115
I understand and thank you
for what you've done.

55:59.280 --> 56:00.759
For everyone else...

56:01.720 --> 56:03.995
I suggest
you call your wives

56:04.160 --> 56:05.559
and tell them
how it's gonna be.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.479
I'll start with mine.

57:04.840 --> 57:07.035
Sam, turn it up.
Turn it up.

57:07.200 --> 57:08.200
Yes, sir.

57:10.480 --> 57:12.038
John.
Morning, sir.

57:17.040 --> 57:20.032
7-5, 7-4, 7-3...

57:27.240 --> 57:28.673
End of the day.

57:34.680 --> 57:35.874
Okay, we're looking good.

57:40.720 --> 57:43.029
Okay.

57:52.760 --> 57:54.159
Sir, might be
the selector latch.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.508
I'm taking a walk.

57:55.680 --> 57:57.280
We're honored
to serve our country.

57:57.440 --> 57:59.670
So we don't think
about danger.

57:59.840 --> 58:01.831
We don't have time
to be scared.

58:02.040 --> 58:03.871
We got a job to do.

58:09.920 --> 58:12.070
Good morning.
Good morning.

58:12.240 --> 58:14.356
Mrs. Jackson.

58:14.520 --> 58:16.715
Colored seats are at the back
of the court room.

58:16.880 --> 58:18.233
Thank you, ma'am.

58:37.400 --> 58:39.277
So, which one of you
wants to go first?

59:02.800 --> 59:07.271
The IBM 7090
data processing system.

59:07.480 --> 59:09.630
It has the capability
of solving

59:09.800 --> 59:12.792
over 24,000 multiplications

59:14.120 --> 59:15.120
per second.

59:15.320 --> 59:16.992
Holy Moses,
that's lightning fast.

59:17.160 --> 59:18.360
They'll never
get that to work.

59:18.640 --> 59:20.756
Oh, it'll run eventually.

59:20.920 --> 59:22.960
And when it does, we have
to know how to program it.

59:23.160 --> 59:24.560
Unless you'd rather be
out of a job.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.119
No, ma'am.

59:31.880 --> 59:33.279
Mr. Z...

59:34.040 --> 59:35.792
I got a court date.

59:39.840 --> 59:41.159
"The computer uses it

59:41.280 --> 59:42.838
"as its high speed
storage unit,

59:43.000 --> 59:45.036
"an information
holding device."

59:45.160 --> 59:46.160
Hmm.

59:46.960 --> 59:48.154
You have a brain.

59:48.320 --> 59:49.833
That I can work with.

59:53.520 --> 59:55.511
This is in the wrong spot.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.191
Attagirl.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480
Ruth.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.256
Yes, sir. Get me the
Cape on the line.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.111
Shepard's trajectories
need to be updated.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.035
Wow.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.949
Where is she?

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.120
You and I are no
different from each other

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.272
Shut our eyes
when we slumber I see numbers

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.071
Black and white
we're computers, I am color

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.440
Don't act like
you was there when you wasn't

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.999
I don't want no free ride

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.319
Some nights I cry

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.436
'Cause I can
see the day comin'

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.591
Together we fly

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.994
Oh, but no more runnin'

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.558
No more runnin'

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.680
Where the hell
have you been?

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.315
Everywhere I look, you're not
where I need you to be.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.629
It's not my imagination.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.916
Now where the hell
do you go every day?

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.392
To the bathroom, sir.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.754
To the bathroom?

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.549
To the damn bathroom.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.108
For 40 minutes a day?

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.673
What do you do
in there?

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.320
We're T-minus zero here.
I put a lot of faith in you.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.909
There's no bathroom
for me here.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.496
What do you mean there is
no bathroom for you here?

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.875
There is no bathroom.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.759
There are no colored
bathrooms in this building

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.876
or any building
outside the West Campus,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.319
which is half a mile away.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.520
Did you know that?

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.636
I have to walk to Timbuktu
just to relieve myself.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.870
And I can't use
one of the handy bikes.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.951
Picture that, Mr. Harrison.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.789
My uniform...

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.679
Skirt below my knees,
my heels,

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.159
and a simple string of pearls.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.992
Well, I don't own pearls.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.957
Lord knows you don't pay
coloreds enough

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.553
to afford pearls!

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.553
And I work like a dog,
day and night,

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.830
living off of coffee
from a pot

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.399
none of you wanna touch!

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.720
So, excuse me

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.472
if I have to go
to the restroom

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.312
a few times a day.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.159
There you have it.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.913
No more colored restrooms.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.230
No more white restrooms.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.992
Just plain old toilets.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.713
Go wherever
you damn well please.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.918
Preferably closer
to your desk.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.030
Here at NASA,
we all pee the same color.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.238
Heard you was
fighting the flu.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.118
Figured you could
use some soup.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.713
Hot meal for the girls.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.517
Come on in.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.959
Excuse me.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.554
Okay, ladies.
Let's say grace.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.113
Bow your heads.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.560
Dear Lord, thank you
for this meal.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.756
We ask that you
bless this food

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.876
so that it may
bless our bodies.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.996
In Jesus's name we pray.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.558
Amen.
Amen.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.912
It's a historic day,
here at Cape Canaveral.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.399
And here's what we can expect.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.438
Alan Shepard and Freedom 7
will be launched into space

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.273
at an altitude of about
116 miles an hour.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.316
Dorothy, come on, you gonna miss it!
Oh, boy! Go.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.656
- Come on, Dorothy.
- I'm coming.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.477
...then he will land
around 35 miles

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.640
off the coast of Florida...

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.955
where he'll be picked up

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.496
by the men
of the USS Lake Champlain...

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.520
Finally. Come over here.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.551
who set out
for this historic purpose.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.616
Freedom 7,
we're going to have to bleed off

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.359
some of the pressure
inside the liquid oxygen tank.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.512
That should reduce the temperature
inside the capsule. Over.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.238
Any day now, CAPCOM.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.240
Fix your little problem
and light this candle.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.959
Roger that, Freedom 7.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.519
Stand by.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.896
Temperature is returning
to normal.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.876
Running one more
launch status check.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.109
All systems now go.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.799
Move to final countdown
sequence.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.473
Moving to final
countdown sequence.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560
Roger that.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.799
We're at T-minus 10...

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.549
nine...

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.835
eight...

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.314
seven...

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.674
six...

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.074
five...

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.514
four...

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.680
three...

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.994
two...

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.434
one...

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.828
zero.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.348
We have ignition.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.314
And we have lift off.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.508
Get up there.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.910
Lift off,
and the clock is started.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.632
Fuel is go. 2.5G.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.869
Get on up there.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.234
- Come on!
- Lift off at

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.197
34 minutes after the hour.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.995
Pitch 88.
Trajectory is good.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.552
Yaw is okay.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.517
Switching manual roll.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.671
Yes!

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.636
For the eyes of the world

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.916
now look into space,

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.389
to the Moon
and to the planets beyond.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.480
Yes!
We did it!

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.676
And we have vowed...

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.195
that we shall not
see it governed...

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.590
by a hostile flag
of conquest...

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.511
but by a banner
of freedom and peace.

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.879
We set sail on this new sea...

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.316
because there is new knowledge
to be gained...

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.357
and new rights to be won.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.434
We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.198
and do the other things...

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.032
not because they are easy...

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.997
but because they are hard.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.637
Suppose we should all
thank President Kennedy

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.677
for the continued
job security.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.153
Uh, Gus Grissom's up next.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.830
Another suborbital flight
with a Redstone.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.749
It's our last shot

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.238
before we strap Glenn
to the Atlas

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:26.839
and pray we can bring him
back down.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.519
Yes, and I imagine
he'd like us

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.352
to have the math
worked out beforehand.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.952
Good work, gentlemen.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.236
Go have dinner
with your kids

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:37.957
and let's get
back to work.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:54.113
Look what you've done to me

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.031
Make me behave like
I wouldn't ever

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:01.390
I know you're the one for me

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:07.113
Your essence is the ink
in the word "forever"

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.068
I think it's high time that
I kissed you, Katherine.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.434
Oh, and why is that?

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.551
Figured you attracted to me,
same as I to you.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.831
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.108
Or you would have told me to
get going a long time ago.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.113
Haven't kissed a man
in a long time.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.599
Almost forgot how to.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.548
The FBI
has arrested four white men

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.073
accused of throwing
a fire bomb

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.593
into a Freedom Rider bus

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.790
outside of Anniston,
Alabama...

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.480
- Hi, babies.
- The bus filled rapidly

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.776
Hi, Mama.
...with black smoke.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.028
We all hit the floor.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.430
All of us realized
the bus was on fire...

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.670
and had to go out
into the mob.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.056
The kids don't need
to be watching this.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.399
They need to see this.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.120
When we got off the bus
in Birmingham...

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.633
Everybody needs to see this.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.552
...took me and forced me
out of the door...

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.869
and threw me into the crowd.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.634
And then I was beaten by one
big guy and several others.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.951
We think we're rendering
a great service to our nation.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.833
For this is not a struggle
for ourselves alone.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.873
It is a struggle
to save the soul of America.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.155
Mary Jackson.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.837
Petition to attend courses
at Hampton High School.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.679
Good morning, Your Honor.

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.874
Hampton High School is
a white school, Mrs. Jackson.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.270
Yes, Your Honor.
I'm aware of that.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.152
Virginia,
still a segregated state.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.237
Regardless of what
the federal government says,

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.590
regardless of what
the Supreme Court says,

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.557
our law is the law.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.555
Your Honor, if I may.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.392
I believe there are
special circumstances

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.480
to be considered.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.278
What would warrant
a colored woman

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.360
attending a white school?

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.032
May I approach
your bench, sir?

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.160
Your Honor...

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.398
you of all people
should understand

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.953
the importance of being first.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.398
How's that, Mrs. Jackson?

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.190
You were the first
in your family

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.157
to serve in the Armed Forces.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.509
U.S. Navy.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.989
The first
to attend university.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.679
George Mason.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.035
And the first state judge
to be recommissioned

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.549
by three consecutive
governors.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.392
You've done some research.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.159
Yes, sir.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.919
What's the point?

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.399
The point is, Your Honor...

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.755
no Negro woman
in the state of Virginia...

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.269
has ever attended
an all-white high school.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.440
It's unheard of.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.192
Yeah. Unheard of.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.560
And before Alan Shepard
sat on top of a rocket,

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.830
no other American
had ever touched space.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.316
And now, he will forever
be remembered

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.909
as the U.S. Navy man
from New Hampshire,

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.116
the first to touch the stars.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.989
And I, sir...

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.674
I plan on being
an engineer at NASA,

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.751
but I can't do that
without taking them classes

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.592
at that all-white high school.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.080
And I can't change
the color of my skin.

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.395
So I have no choice
but to be the first.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.151
Which I can't do
without you, sir.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.400
Your Honor...

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.954
out of all the cases
you're gonna hear today...

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.634
which one is gonna matter
100 years from now?

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.233
Which one is gonna
make you the first?

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.200
Hmm.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.072
Only the night classes...

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.513
Mrs. Jackson.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.074
Yes, yes, yes!

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.309
Yes!

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.068
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.656
How late did he say
he was gonna be?

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.576
Excuse me.
No more than five minutes, sir.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.079
Gus Grissom's
coordinates.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.192
Uh, I'd like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.200
Do you have any idea
what you're asking?

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.437
An orbital launch with an Atlas
rocket is going to take time.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.392
Is there a problem?

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.914
Mr. Harrison...

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.318
I was wondering.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.277
Uh-huh. I've been
wondering my whole life,

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.998
so you just
spit it out.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.071
Well, sir...

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.550
I would like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:21.776
This isn't about
plugging in numbers,

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.000
it's about inventing the math.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.856
And I think you and I
talked about that, right?

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.880
It doesn't exist.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.040
I can do it, sir.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.633
Do you have any idea
how exacting

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.233
these calculations have to be?

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.829
It's like shooting a sawed-off
shotgun from a thousand feet

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.696
and getting that one BB through a
hole so tiny, you can't even see it.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:36.736
Okay, let me see
what you've got.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:37.840
I'm an excellent shot, sir.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.476
How have the
Grissom numbers been?

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.559
They've been spot on.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.468
Give Glenn's orbit a go.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.696
But you run it all through
Stafford, you understand?

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:50.720
Yes, sir.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.349
Thank you.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.278
Computers don't
author reports.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.674
CAPCOM,
this is Liberty Bell 7.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.760
Loud and clear.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.837
Okay, it's a nice
ride up to now.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Roger.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.716
Liberty Bell 7,
this is Hook 1 approaching.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.800
Ready to hook on. Over.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.190
I read you loud
and clear. Over.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.360
The hatch is blown,
CAPCOM.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.597
The Liberty Bell 7
capsule is taking on water.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.671
Gus Grissom
is out of the capsule.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.354
Rescuers are now going
to pull him

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.440
from the ocean waves.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.673
Unfortunately, the Liberty
Bell 7 capsule is lost.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.880
Mama.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.800
I can't, I can't.
Mary.

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.136
Mr. Harrison,

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.480
taxpayer money
sank into the ocean

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:50.794
along with your capsule.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.960
So what makes you think

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.837
you can bring
John Glenn home safely?

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Let me say first...

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.480
discovery is never
just for the sake

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.560
of discovery, gentlemen...

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.750
but for the sake
of human survival.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.635
And it will always
come with a risk.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.310
Whoever gets there first
will make the rules.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.471
That's been true
of every civilization.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.639
And so, I think
the bigger question

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.239
for this body
to consider is...

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.995
who do you want calling
the shots in space?

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.631
We have to know
what's out there, Senator.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.879
We have to touch the stars,

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.269
if only to ensure
our own survival.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.271
And only a man can do that.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.559
We'll get
John Glenn home safely

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.119
because we have to.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.315
Because he has to tell us
what he saw.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.871
The Redstone rocket
went straight up.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.312
But the capsule
didn't have enough speed

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.920
to go into orbit,
so it came back down.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.110
Essentially a triangle.
Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.872
That math was known.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.548
That took Shepard,
took Grissom.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.913
That cannot take Glenn.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.472
Now, the Atlas rocket...

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.077
that can push us into orbit.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.357
Goes up, delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.958
Earth's gravity
keeps pulling at it

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.759
but it's going so fast,
it keeps missing the Earth.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.672
That's how it stays in orbit.

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.115
Now, getting it back down...

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.552
that's the math
we don't know.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.640
Yes, Katherine.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.473
So the capsule will spin
around the Earth forever

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.551
because there's nothing
to slow it down?

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.280
That's right.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.398
Slowing it down at precisely
the right moment,

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.152
at precisely
the right amount,

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.320
that's the task.

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.480
Yes, Katherine.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.076
So it needs to move
from an elliptical orbit...

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.670
to a parabolic orbit.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:42.880
Yes.

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.711
That's the "Go/No-go."

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.836
Now at this point,
it's a pin head.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.993
We bring him in too soon...

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.798
He burns up
on reentry.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.188
That's right.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.679
We bring him in
too late...

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.432
he's pushed
out of Earth's gravity.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.910
And any changes to mass,
weight, speed, time...

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.436
distance, friction,
or a puff of wind...

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.396
would alter the "Go/No-go."

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.518
And we start
our calculations over.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:10.920
Yes.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.435
So we need to be able to
choose this reentry point.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:19.592
Now this "Go/No-go,"
this has to be exact.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.795
Sam.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.556
These are the latest
Redstone numbers

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:24.959
in current capsule data.

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.678
Obviously, we know
the launch spot.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.760
Thanks.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.592
A Pentagon briefing
should illuminate

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.398
where the Navy
needs the recovery zone.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.431
Then we work backwards
from there.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.715
And the rest is on us,
so let's get to work.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.440
Uh, Mr. Stafford.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.760
What, Katherine?

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.153
If I could
attend the briefings,

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.390
I'd be more useful
to the project.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.391
Pentagon briefings
are closed door.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.393
Yes, but if we don't
have the information

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.799
of the changes...

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.960
we can't keep up.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.456
I need those changes
as they occur.

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.600
As you said,
it's a pin head.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.512
Katherine, that's the job.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.238
You asked for this assignment,

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.390
so just calculate
with what you have.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.516
Or we'll find
someone who can.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.275
Okay.

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.917
Attagirl.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.590
What the hell are you doing?
You can't be in here.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.795
Who are you?

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.871
I'm with
the West Computing Group.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.348
Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.238
This is a very delicate
piece of equipment.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.176
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.430
Uh-huh.
Bill, we've got numbers.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.518
What kind of numbers?

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.993
Well, I'll be.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.149
What's your name again?

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.274
Dorothy Vaughan.

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.913
Dorothy Vaughan.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.634
Sir, the parameters
for Friendship 7.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.393
Oh, this is all moot.

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.391
We're altering the
window on the capsule.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.040
When did this happen?
Six minutes ago.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.639
The math is changing.
Start over.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.076
Sir, if I could attend the briefings,
I could stay current...

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.719
Katherine, we have
been through this.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.880
It is not possible.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.616
There is no protocol
for women attending.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.789
There's no protocol
for a man

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.160
circling the Earth either, sir.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.839
Okay. That is just
the way things are.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.593
Colonel Glenn's
launch coordinates,

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.160
accounting for
the window change, sir.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.508
I have told you this.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.120
Computers don't
author reports. Fix it.

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.356
Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.431
That is not the way
this works.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.955
Paul. What's
happening here?

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.270
Mr. Harrison, I would like
to attend today's briefing.

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.509
And why is that?

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:19.359
Sir, the data changes so fast.
The capsule changes.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.959
The weight and the landing zones

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.553
are all changing, every day.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.950
I do my work, you attend
these briefings,

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.040
I have to start over.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.511
Colonel Glenn launches
in a few weeks.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.600
We don't have the math
figured out yet.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.079
Why is it she can't attend?

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.456
Because she doesn't
have clearance, Al.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.913
I cannot do
my work effectively

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.360
if I do not have
all of the data

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.635
and all of the information
as soon as it's available.

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.456
I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.152
Pentagon briefings
are not for civilians.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.416
It requires
the highest clearance.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.456
I feel like
I'm the best person

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.640
to present my calculations...

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.736
You're not gonna let this go, are you?
No, I am not.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.716
And she is a woman.
There is no protocol

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:51.936
for a woman
attending these meetings.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.279
Okay, I get that part, Paul.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.833
But within these walls,

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.319
who makes the rules?

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.993
You, sir. You are the boss.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.799
You just have
to act like one. Sir.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.309
You keep quiet.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.269
Thank you.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.269
Good morning.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.428
Gentlemen.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:31.440
This is Katherine Goble

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.875
with our Trajectory
and Launch Window division.

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.195
Her work is pertinent
to today's proceedings.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.440
Come on.

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:41.874
Wanna get her a chair?

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.856
We have a
confirmed launch window...

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.200
Get her a chair, please.
Yes, sir.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.336
We have a
confirmed launch window

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.475
for Friendship 7.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.800
Let's discuss a landing zone.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.669
The Navy needs
a singular landing zone.

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.115
20 miles square is what we
can service for retrieval.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.320
Outside of that

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.198
we risk the capsule's recovery.

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.635
We'd like three possible
recovery areas.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.160
We can't cover
half the damn ocean.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.955
With all due respect,

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.798
our capsule's being
altered daily.

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.995
We're orbiting the Earth
at what speed now?

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Uh...

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.754
17,544 miles per hour...

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.751
at the time the rocket
delivers the capsule

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.074
into low space orbit.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.360
Well, that's one hell
of a speeding ticket.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.880
Okay.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.353
So we have
the vehicle's speed,

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.555
the launch window...

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.358
and for argument's sake,
the landing zone

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.714
is the Bahamas.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.598
Should be enough
to figure the "Go/No-go"?

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.239
Yeah, in theory, sir.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.992
We need to be past
theory at this point.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.838
We'll be able to
calculate a "Go/No-go"

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.433
with that information.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.511
When exactly
is that gonna happen?

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:57.960
Katherine.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.472
Have a go at it.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.628
The "Go" point for re-entry
is 2,990 miles

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.639
from where we want
Colonel Glenn to land.

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:39.070
If we assume
that's the Bahamas...

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.710
at 17,544 miles per hour...

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.468
upon re-entry...

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:48.992
370 feet...

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.318
at a descent angle...

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.830
of 46.56 degrees.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.480
Distance...

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.635
velocity squared, sine...

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.995
gravity squared.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.554
Sine, 32 feet.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.273
And the distance would be...

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.197
20,530,372 feet...

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:23.037
or 2,990 miles...

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:28.875
or 46.33 degrees.

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.628
Okay, so that puts
your landing zone

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.349
at 5.0667 degrees North...

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.512
77.3333 degrees West.

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.512
Which is here.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.072
Right here.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.356
Give or take
20 square miles.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.514
I like her numbers.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.194
Thank you.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.832
That, of course,
is assuming

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.559
the capsule hits
the re-entry point exactly.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.196
How do we ensure that?

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.911
That's the math we don't
have yet, gentlemen.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.833
We're working on it.

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.229
Katherine.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.376
What's it gonna take to make
this thing worth the price tag?

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.755
We're just getting up
to speed here, Mr. Harrison.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.915
I need more manpower.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.877
I need programmers,
folks to feed the cards.

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.519
Get them,
for crying out loud.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.600
Okay.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.716
You're the IBM man, right?
Yes, sir.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.711
Go pull them out of the sky
if you have to.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.576
Let's get ahead of this thing
or I'm not paying you.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.828
Understood.

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.190
I got that one,
I got that one.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.352
I'm not paying any of you.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:55.960
Me?

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.758
Temporarily, yes.

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.036
We need the IBM
for Glenn's launch.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.160
The lead engineer says
you're good with the cards,

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.519
programming and such.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.752
What about the girls here?

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.388
Human computers can't
calculate an orbital flight

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.879
in the time we have.

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.473
They'll stay put for now.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.312
What about after now?

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.548
After Glenn's launch,

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.949
NASA's dissolving
the computing groups.

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.231
I'm not accepting reassignment

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.311
unless I bring my
ladies with me.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.235
Excuse me?

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.914
We're gonna need a lot of
manpower to program that beast.

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.308
I can't do it alone.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.631
My gals are ready.
They can do the work.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.309
Ladies.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.352
We've been reassigned.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:45.909
Leave your calculators.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.513
You won't need them
where we're going.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.751
Welcome, ladies.

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.070
You know
what your job is, Paul?

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.590
Find the genius
among those geniuses.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.433
To pull us all up.

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.397
We all get
to the peak together

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.998
or we don't
get there at all.

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.430
Yes.
Well, good night, sir.

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:50.030
I don't know what time
I'm coming home.

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.872
Class ends at nine.

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.473
You got something to say?

01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.437
I thought
you might need these.

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.070
You can refill them with
any weight lead you want.

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:09.313
You see, you just
hit the top like this.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.151
All right?
The lead comes out.

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.638
You put the new lead in...

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:17.673
and new pencil.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.595
You gonna make a fine engineer.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600
You think so?

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:26.829
Yes.

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.752
And nobody dare stand
in the way...

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.354
of Mary Jackson's dreams.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.913
Myself included.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:42.590
Don't make me mad again.

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.988
Yes, ma'am.

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.591
And don't
make me late, either.

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.280
You gonna be late.
I'mma make you late.

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.879
You won't be late.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.509
All right, gentlemen.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.720
Tonight, we discuss

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.951
Planck-Einstein
wavelength relationships.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.155
Yes?

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:12.789
I'm Mary Jackson.

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.313
I'm enrolled.

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:18.631
Well, the curriculum
is not designed

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:19.869
for teaching a woman.

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.551
I imagine it's the same
as teaching a man.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.316
I don't see a
colored section.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.232
Should I just
take any seat?

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.835
Thank you.

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.472
Okay. Uh...

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.319
Planck-Einstein.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.200
The problem...

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:49.437
is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.073
to a parabolic orbit.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.229
There's no mathematical
formula for that.

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:56.874
Because we can calculate
launch and landing...

01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.393
but without this conversion

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.915
the capsule stays in orbit,
we can't bring it back home.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:05.120
Maybe we've been thinking
about this all wrong.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:06.560
How's that?

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.718
Maybe it's not
new math at all.

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.432
It could be old math.

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.715
Something that looks
at the problem numerically,

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.358
and not theoretically.

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.272
Math is always dependable.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.634
For you it is.

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.475
Euler's method.

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.789
Yes.

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.030
But that's ancient.
But it works.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.312
It works numerically.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.669
That's it.

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.348
Let's type it up.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.520
Okay.

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.429
Huh.

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.834
Dorothy.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.039
Mrs. Mitchell.

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.191
You're working late today.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.515
Seems to always
happen that way.

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:04.671
Yes. Seems to.

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:13.520
Thank you.

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:20.393
I hear the IBM's
up to full capacity.

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.198
You certainly
have a knack for it.

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.678
My father taught me a thing
or two about mechanics.

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.755
You know, I have a few
girls in the East Group

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:32.229
that have an interest
in learning more about it.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.515
It is the future.

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.989
I may bring them by,
if it's all the same to you.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.552
That's not my
decision, ma'am.

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:40.752
That would be
the supervisor's.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.438
Yes, that's true.

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.272
Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.719
You know, Dorothy.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.351
Despite what you may think...

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.755
I have nothing against y'all.

01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:59.109
I know.

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.430
I know you
probably believe that.

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.280
Good night,
Katherine.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.475
Good night.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.438
Mama!
Hey, babies.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.431
Mama.
Hi.

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:26.269
Hey.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.479
Oh, please don't tell me
I missed someone's birthday.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:30.640
No, you didn't.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.869
No, you didn't, Mama.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.638
Madame, your seat.

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.552
Well, thank you.

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.471
Wait, is it my birthday?

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.789
No, Mama.

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.479
You all look so pretty.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.835
Mama, what's going on?

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.313
Good evening, Katherine.

01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.600
So you're not gonna
say anything?

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:01.193
It's not my place.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.228
You, either?

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.076
Okay, I'm not gonna
do this all night.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.479
Oh, mother of mercy.

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.200
That's for me.

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:20.636
Are you sad, Mama?
No.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:23.030
It's okay, Mama.
He's a good man.

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.952
I know.

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.416
I just can't help it.

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.192
He hasn't even
asked you yet.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.157
I know, but he is.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.320
You are, right?

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:33.708
If y'all will let me.

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.996
Well, go on.
She's already crying.

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.513
Oh, hush.

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:38.720
This was my mother's ring.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.953
It's beautiful.

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.160
She and my father
were married for...

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.548
For 52 years.

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.550
Figure it's about as lucky
a ring as you can get.

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:52.470
The day I met you,
I called my mother

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.712
and I said, "Mom, I met the
woman I want to marry."

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.074
What'd she say?

01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:58.776
She said, "She must be
something, Jimmy.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.800
"Really something."

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.069
Then what'd you say?

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:02.468
I said, "No.

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.557
"She's more than something.

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:07.233
"She's everything."

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.080
Now...

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.478
I planned on this being
more romantic.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.896
I'll make that
up to you real soon.

01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:13.989
It's okay.

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:17.072
But I know marrying you

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.592
includes marrying
your girls as well.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.079
Amen to that.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:24.760
I do.

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.751
I didn't ask you yet.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.035
Hurry up.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.392
Oh, my goodness.

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.240
Oh!

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:39.115
My babies. Look, girls,
isn't it beautiful?

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.195
Look, Mama.

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.000
The
Mercury-Atlas space vehicle...

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.160
which will put John Glenn,

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:47.800
the first American,
into Earth's orbit...

01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:51.031
has already undergone
five unmanned flight tests.

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:52.200
NASA has confirmed

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:55.033
that the IBM 790
data processing system...

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:57.350
has been utilized to confirm
all of the mission 's...

01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:59.795
launch and recovery
system calculations.

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.720
The modifications
and equipment installations

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:03.074
are progressing on schedule.

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.958
Yes, sir. Right in here.

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:07.640
You wanted
to see me, sir?

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:08.800
Have a seat.

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:11.592
Is there something wrong,
Mr. Harrison?

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.318
No, there's nothing wrong.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.877
In fact, our IBM
is churning out numbers

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.110
in fractions of the time
any human can.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.952
Present company included.

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:23.119
That's good then.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.149
Maybe.

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:29.640
The thing is,
the Cape's now insisting

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.035
on doing all the backups
down there, on site.

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.280
I see.

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.311
So we won't be
running backups here.

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:40.313
And truth be told, we can't
keep up with that IBM anyhow.

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:45.511
Long story short,
we no longer need

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.158
a computer in this department.

01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.671
Progress
is a double-edged sword.

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.309
Let's have you report back
to the West Group for now.

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.277
We'll see if we can find
another assignment.

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:02.313
Thank you, sir.

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.200
Katherine, I'm...

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.952
I'm sorry about this.

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.190
It's out of my hands,
if you can believe that.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.794
I understand.

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.040
Katherine.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.872
We heard you got engaged.

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.080
Yes.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:47.994
That's thoughtful of you.

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.839
They're lovely.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.831
Mr. Harrison's idea, really.

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.358
Although I suspect his
wife did the picking out.

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:05.353
Can't imagine he has an eye
for anything but numbers.

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.239
Now you have
a great wedding.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.751
You did good work
around here, Katherine.

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:43.096
Hello there.
Good to see you.

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.720
Hi, Reverend. How you doing?
How are you?

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:49.157
I don't think I felt a thing
the first time I did this.

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.799
I was so nervous.

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.016
You're just
as beautiful

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.189
as you were back then.

01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:56.992
- You think so?
- Mmm.

01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.119
Just a little older.

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.550
And a little fuller.

01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.959
But you look good.

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:09.231
Well, here we go. Again.

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:10.776
Project Mercury...

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.153
named after the winged messenger

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.674
of the gods in
Roman mythology. Today,

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:17.320
three years, two months,
and three days afterwards...

01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:19.456
we're ready,
after 10 scheduled attempts...

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.959
Attagirl.

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.997
to try again to put
our first man into orbit...

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.798
to put Colonel John Glenn
into orbit.

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:27.440
Colonel John Glenn will be the
first American to orbit the Earth.

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:29.040
As you can see, there are

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.360
thousands of people here today

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:32.311
to witness this historic event.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.833
Paul, something's off here.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.150
These landing coordinates
don't match yesterday's.

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.839
The IBM just ran them.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.791
Well, then the IBM
was wrong yesterday.

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:45.515
Right?

01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.839
Or the damn thing's wrong today.

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:53.790
Paul, am I right?

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:56.198
It appears so.

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.999
The IBM's been spot-on
up to this point, John.

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.196
But we'll run it again,
see what it comes up with.

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.078
Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you, Al.

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.196
When I fly,
I fly the machine.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.715
And right now it seems like
this machine is flying me.

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.040
We're on the same page, John.

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.354
Our guys are on it.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.312
Let's get the girl
to check the numbers.

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.832
- The girl?
- Yes, sir.

01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:19.829
You mean Katherine?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.991
Yes, sir. The smart one.

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.549
I mean, she says they're good,
I'm ready to go.

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:26.880
All right. We'll get into it.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.268
Roger.

01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:31.360
Sam.

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.719
Go find Katherine Goble.

01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.075
She needs to verify
Glenn's "Go/No-go,"

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.440
or we're staying
on the ground.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.709
Yes, sir.

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.118
I'm looking for Katherine Goble.

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.469
It's Katherine Johnson now.

01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.280
They need you to verify
these coordinates.

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.959
...and tourists have poured
into Cocoa Beach for weeks.

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:13.156
Took this whole area
surrounding Cape Canaveral

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.759
and Florida, really.

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.150
And all around the country,
it's as if time...

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:19.390
All right, give her
some space. Let her work.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:23.235
...as we await
Colonel John Glenn's launch.

01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:25.311
A truly historic day
for America.

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:28.278
The country has waited
for several months,

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:31.477
through many failed unmanned
Atlas rocket tests

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.638
and 10 scheduled
manned attempts...

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:36.870
which were canceled
for various mechanical

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.791
or system complications.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:39.880
Even the weather...

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.616
All the final tests and checks

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:42.755
are being conducted.

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:45.639
John Glenn is ready to board
the Friendship 7.

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.030
But today we remain
truly optimistic,

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:50.509
and it's a "Go" day
in all regards.

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.272
The capsule is ready.

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.158
The rocket itself is A-Okay,

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:56.117
and the weather here
at Cape Canaveral...

01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:58.475
Anything from Langley?
Not yet.

01:43:58.640 --> 01:43:59.789
We are being told

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:01.473
that Mission Control at NASA

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:03.870
is conducting
a final check of the launch

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.149
and recovery coordinates.

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.834
Including the "Go/No-go"
calculations...

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
so crucial

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.800
to a safe and successful
launch and recovery.

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:13.520
After years of
waiting, and months of delay,

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:16.712
Colonel Glenn is finally ready
for that space flight...

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:19.000
that we've been waiting for
with so much anticipation.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:20.976
These last-minute
checks could indicate

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.877
a hesitancy on NASA's behalf.

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.520
But let us say,
without reservation...

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.197
that the safety
of Colonel John Glenn

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:28.560
is paramount to the mission...

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.513
and to the nation itself.

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:31.829
No, sir.
We're still a go.

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:33.554
Yes, sir.

01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:38.320
That's it.

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.120
What the devil are you doing?
Are you taking a break?

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:50.514
Yes!

01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:53.031
Say yeah

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.355
Yeah

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:56.719
Say, yeah!

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.560
Yeah

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.230
Don't you know,
we never ever

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.235
Never know
what makes us major

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:11.199
Your and my alchemy

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:12.395
Yes, we can

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.239
One and one equals three

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.549
Yes, we can

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:18.830
I feel it like lightning
in the forest

01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.400
Yes, we can

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:23.239
Pick a number, pick a note
Harmonize the chords

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.470
You're my woman
don't need another

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.240
Get behind the other
We can lift each other

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:29.589
It's all very well
that we may never...

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.760
Whoo!

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:33.919
Do you have the time?

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.315
Yes, we can

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.630
Like a solar system
they're surrounded by you

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.400
Yes, we can

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.075
Pick a number, pick a note
Harmonize the chords

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.231
You're my woman
don't need another

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.231
Get behind the other
we can lift each other

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:49.436
...It's all very well
that we may never...

01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:50.720
Whoo!

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:52.992
You're my woman
Don't need another

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.435
Get behind the other
We can lift each other

01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:58.075
Whoo!

01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:06.480
Sir.

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:12.115
Pad 14.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.160
Katherine.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:31.440
Come on.

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:36.911
Sir, we've got
Pad 14 on the box.

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.680
All right.
Let me in there.

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:44.634
This is Langley, we have
the coordinates confirmed.

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.320
Stand by, Langley.

01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:49.760
We can confirm...

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:52.793
the "Go/No-go" point
for re-entry is...

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:58.318
16.11984 degrees latitude...

01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:04.032
-165.2356 degrees longitude.

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.998
The launch window is a go.

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:09.151
The landing coordinates match.

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.952
That is very good news, Al.

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:14.280
It's a little hard to trust something
you can't look in the eyes.

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:15.839
That's right, Colonel.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.718
Katherine did manage
to calculate

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.996
a few decimal points further
than that hunk of metal.

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:22.637
I will take every digit
you got.

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:23.840
Be sure to thank her for me.

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.192
Gentlemen,
let's launch this rocket.

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:27.679
Good luck, Friendship 7.

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.319
Godspeed, Langley.

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.039
Here
at Cape Canaveral...

01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:35.758
the countdown has resumed...

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.478
as Colonel John Glenn...

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:39.238
is now aboard
the Friendship 7...

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:41.755
high above the
Atlas rocket on Pad 14.

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.516
A height of over 93 feet.

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:45.760
So far, the countdown is...

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:48.229
These are pictures
from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.510
The gantry is now moving back.

01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.398
We are go for launch.

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:55.154
The Mercury
spacecraft umbilical is out.

01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:58.036
T-minus 10 seconds,
and counting.

01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.496
Water systems, go.
Mercury capsule, go.

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:00.576
Eight, seven...

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.431
Six, five...
Ready engine. Start.

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:03.696
four...

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.870
three, two...
Good Lord, ride all the way.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:08.196
One, zero.

01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:09.554
Ignition.

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.709
Lift off.

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:18.076
The M-A 6 vehicle
has lifted off.

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:22.560
It's getting
a little bumpy along here.

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.790
Roger that.
You are in Max Q.

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.439
Roger that, CAPCOM.

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.471
All systems
are reported go.

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:30.119
20 seconds to SECO.

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.191
The trajectory
is still A-Okay.

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:33.435
Go for SECO.

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.079
Roger that, CAPCOM.
Go for SECO.

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:44.154
Zero G and I feel fine.

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.114
John Glenn reports
everything looks good.

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:50.434
Oh, that view is tremendous!

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.956
Roger that, Friendship 7.

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:00.757
You are go for orbit.

01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:02.399
Thank you, CAPCOM.

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:09.750
All right.
Ten and a half hours to go.

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.353
If we make seven
round trips.

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:14.119
I could use a coffee.

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.956
Well, as we
approach the end of the day

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:19.638
here on
the Eastern Seaboard...

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.519
Colonel Glenn is just
beginning his third orbit...

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:25.194
three-quarters of the way
across the African continent.

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.952
We see he's currently
over Zanzibar...

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.628
which is the next
tracking station coming up.

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:31.950
Thankfully,
the F riendship 7 capsule is...

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.313
New assignment
came down the pike.

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:48.035
Always changing
around here.

01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:50.111
It's hard to keep up.

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.176
Seems like they're going
to need a permanent team

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:56.031
to feed that IBM.

01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:57.633
How big of a team?

01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:59.711
Thirty, to start.

01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:04.710
Thank you for the information,
Mrs. Mitchell.

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:09.318
You're quite welcome,
Mrs. Vaughan.

01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:24.675
Hmm.

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.713
We have a warning light.

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.356
CAPCOM 7,
I have a warning light.

01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.669
Stand by, Seven.

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.231
Sir, we have a warning light.

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.273
What are we
looking at, Paul?

01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.475
Uh...

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:10.596
The heat shield
may have come loose.

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:12.830
Seven, will you confirm
the landing bag

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:13.920
is in the off position?

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:16.439
Affirmative, CAPCOM.

01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:17.919
Al, we need
to get him down now.

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.798
He could burn up
on re-entry.

01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:30.591
Come on, babies.

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:31.875
There is a man in space.

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:33.576
And we don't want to miss it,
so we gotta hurry.

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.272
Something's wrong
with Glenn!

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:36.800
What's going on?
Come on, let's go.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:39.075
Come on. Hurry up, now.
Y'all follow me.

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:42.630
We just learned
that the Friendship 7...

01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:45.798
is in danger of losing
its heat shield.

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:47.996
Have you heard
any banging noises...

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:49.798
or anything of this type
at higher rates?

01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:51.313
That is a negative, CAPCOM.

01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.277
This poses a grave danger
to the mission.

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:57.228
Tell them not to jettison
the retro-package.

01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:58.816
NASA is confirming there is

01:51:58.840 --> 01:51:59.989
some sort of malfunction

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:01.256
with the capsule's
heat shield...

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:03.589
and it may not stay in place.

01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:05.756
If the heat shield's loose...

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:09.276
the retro-package straps
might hold it in place.

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:10.475
Will that work?

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:12.312
It will work.

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:15.040
It will hold it until he
reaches the "Go/No-go" point.

01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.200
It will work.

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:20.359
Al, he has
to override the.05G.

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:21.520
Do it.

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:23.033
Friendship 7...

01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.033
we're recommending
that the retro-package not...

01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:28.270
I repeat, not be jettisoned.

01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:32.314
This means that you will have
to override the. 05G switch.

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:33.480
Roger.

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.989
Is there a reason
for this? Over.

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:37.160
Stand by, Seven.

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:43.669
Not at this time, Seven.

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:46.473
Roger that, Command.

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.154
I will make
a manual.05G entry...

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.669
and bring the scope in. Over.

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:56.514
He knows.

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:05.840
Without a heat shield...

01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.760
there is no way that
Colonel Glenn can get back

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.016
through the Earth's atmosphere.

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.712
The heat is simply
too overpowering.

01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:13.550
A malfunction in the automatic
control system...

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:16.991
is causing the spacecraft
to yaw in a skid-like fashion.

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:18.832
Thus putting the Friendship 7's

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:21.195
re-entry point in jeopardy.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:24.716
Even now, Colonel Glenn is streaking
toward the United States.

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:27.348
And he must begin
the retro-sequence

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.271
300 miles west of California...

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:31.078
if he's to reenter
the atmosphere

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.389
at the designated point...

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.437
and land in the recovery area

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:37.393
700 miles south
and east of Florida.

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:40.199
Stay tuned to this station
for further details.

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:42.510
You're going to be
using fly-by-wire

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:43.600
for re-entry.

01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:46.433
You'll need to maintain
a zero angle, over.

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:48.716
Roger. I'm on fly-by-wire.

01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.911
Back it up with manual. Over.

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.229
Keep talking to him.

01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.400
Roger.

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.915
The weather,
the recovery area...

01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:58.389
three foot waves,
10 miles visibility.

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:00.915
CAPCOM, you're going out.

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:02.911
He's crossing the
communication blackout zone.

01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:07.439
There's a real fireball outside.

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:08.880
It's getting
a little hot in here.

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:23.559
CAPCOM, do you copy?

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:55.108
Friendship 7,
do you copy? Over.

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:00.320
Again.

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:02.471
Friendship 7,
do you copy? Over.

01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:19.190
Friendship 7,
do you copy? Over.

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:34.750
Loud and clear, CAPCOM.

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:37.115
Roger that.
How are you doing?

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:41.399
My condition is good.
That was a real fireball. Boy!

01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:42.560
Roger that.

01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:44.033
Let's get you
all the way home.

01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:45.360
Roger that.

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:47.630
Here's hoping these landing
coordinates still hold.

01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:52.191
Approaching 16.11984.

01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:53.280
Roger.

01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:57.353
Approaching
minus 165.2356...

01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:00.478
in three, two, one.

01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:02.159
Engaging chutes.

01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:05.199
Beautiful chute!

01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:07.314
How are we looking, CAPCOM?

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.351
Your "'Go/No-go" is good.

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:11.676
Landing coordinates
are spot on, 7.

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:13.440
Roger that, CAPCOM.

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:18.033
I've always wanted to swim
in the Bahamas. Over.

01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:25.070
John Glenn has splashed down
and he is being recovered.

01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:26.275
Thank you!

01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:30.674
John Glenn has
splashed down safely...

01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:33.274
and is being recovered
by the USS Noa.

01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:38.076
Good job. Great job, guys.

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:39.240
Katherine.

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:45.360
Nice work.

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.113
You too, Mr. Harrison.

01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:50.595
So, um...

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.792
you think
we can get to the moon?

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:58.388
We're already there, sir.

01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:02.920
Yeah.

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:13.079
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:43.838
Girls, this is
Mrs. Vaughan...

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.353
your supervisor.

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:46.953
She'll show you
how things work.

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:48.835
Come on in.

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:55.193
The IBM 7090 data
processing system...

01:57:55.320 --> 01:58:00.155
is capable of solving 24,000
multiplications per second.

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.556
They'll call it a mystery

01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:52.588
But we're gonna call it
Victory

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:54.233
We'll be writing history

01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:55.919
It's gonna be

01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:57.599
Victory

01:59:57.720 --> 01:59:59.631
They'll be signs
on top of signs

01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:00.994
Just so you know the

02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:02.513
History

02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:04.477
It's saying victory

02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:07.597
Is with me

02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:10.635
Oh, let them laugh about it

02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:13.155
Don't worry
what the doubter's saying

02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:15.316
Yes, it's an uphill battle

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:17.749
But guess who else
is playin '

02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:20.628
The next time
y'all in action

02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:22.791
And the ghost is in the room

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.749
Watch you work
through the masses

02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:27.637
You know
that we've been used

02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:29.956
Don't let it be

02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:31.952
Don't let it be

02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:36.997
No matter how deep

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:42.634
I swear just believe

02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:44.671
You'll find victory

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:47.314
Find your victory

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:49.870
They'll call it a mystery

02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:51.833
But we're gonna call it

02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:52.960
Victory

02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:54.951
We'll be writing history

02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:56.678
It's gonna be

02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.068
Victory

02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:00.116
They'll be
signs on top of signs

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:01.872
Just so you know the

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.149
History

02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:04.998
It's saying victory

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.718
Is with me

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.954
The Bible says
you should pray for nothing

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.917
'Cause every week
it's gonna be something

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.958
You know the devil
can't wait to jump in

02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:19.036
And complicate
the things you trust in

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:21.469
But I know my foundation

02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:24.154
Is solid
and can take some hating

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:27.030
Prayer's gon' be
on this space station

02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:29.236
On the way
to the master's apron

02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:31.993
They'll call it a mystery

02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.433
Victory

02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:35.670
We'll be writing history

02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:36.795
It's gon' be

02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:38.518
Victory

02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:41.034
It's saying victory

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:43.719
Is with me

02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:47.039
Hey!

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.197
Oh

02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:01.149
When I first got here

02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:03.231
I defined my way

02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:05.868
But the end of the days
were dark

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:08.554
When I was not clear

02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:10.233
You showed me my mistakes

02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:13.398
But told me keep the pace
Don't get lost

02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:18.111
So should I not fear, yeah

02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.031
That's how it feels
when you love me

02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.634
And you're my sightseer

02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:25.751
'Cause before I'm in a rut

02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:28.838
You multiply by 10 times
what they took from me

02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:33.429
You send out a branch
from the longest tree

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:36.597
When I'm in quicksand

02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:41.274
But in my mind
it's really your arm to me

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:45.473
Can't believe it, what a
lift and hard to believe

02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:47.989
Surrender
But there's a difference

02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:50.315
Surrender, surrender

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:53.113
'Cause I understand
Explain to me

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:55.510
There's no coincidence

02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:57.636
Just confirmation

02:02:57.960 --> 02:02:59.279
Let me see them hands

02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:01.872
I was down on myself

02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.552
And I called you

02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:08.634
And your answer is
"What can I do?"

02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:12.950
So much you do for me

02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:18.629
In the sound of my breath
seen all the years

02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:20.756
Of surrender

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:24.311
Just know I'm here

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.639
Reporting for duty

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:32.272
When it feel this good
Don't ever let go, go

02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:35.511
Don't ever let go, oh

02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:39.513
When it feel this good
Don't ever let go, go

02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:41.193
Don't ever let go, oh

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.152
Don't ever let go, oh

02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:45.989
Hard to believe

02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.157
Surrender
but there's a difference

02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:50.191
Surrender, surrender

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:53.554
'Cause I understand
Explain to me

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:56.071
There's no coincidence

02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:57.878
Just confirmation

02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:00.272
Let me see them hands

02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:01.588
Please, just wave

02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:03.113
Wave, wave

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:05.998
Wave, wave Wave

02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.309
In this place

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:09.553
Just wave
Wave

02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:10.874
Wave your hands

02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:13.232
Wave, wave

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:22.315
Try to understand the way
I've been behaving

02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:25.877
It's a funny thing
you really gotta see

02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:29.717
Is it just your love
that's got me going crazy?

02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:32.395
Or are my eyes
playing with me

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:38.397
All day your love just
comes shining down

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.158
Just like the sweetest bees

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:46.550
I feel you from
my root to my crown

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:51.239
It's mighty good to me
Like caramel

02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:53.157
He's right beside me

02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.231
My mind's his carousel

02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:57.231
It's how he rides me

02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:59.396
So there's no parallels

02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:03.075
Y'all know me very well

02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:05.038
It's yellow lightning

02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:09.753
Try to understand the way
I've been behaving

02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:13.718
It's a funny thing
you really gotta see

02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:17.757
Is it just your love
that's got me going crazy

02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:20.235
Or are my eyes
playing with me

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:22.596
Just like a mirage

02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:28.114
I love you like
you were gold

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:30.869
Just like a mirage

02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:35.750
I love you
like you were gold

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:38.596
Just like a mirage

02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.714
I love you
like you were gold

02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:44.552
Gold, gold

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.475
And I'm sorry, baby

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.631
For the what ifs, maybes

02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:51.557
I've taken too far

02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:53.710
I know I must be
looking crazy

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:55.711
I'm sorry, baby

02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:57.797
For the what ifs, maybes

02:05:57.920 --> 02:05:59.478
I take it too far

02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:02.513
You know I must be
looking crazy

02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:05.758
Try to understand the way
I've been behaving

02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:09.558
It's a funny thing
you really gotta see

02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:13.753
Is it just your love that's
got me going crazy

02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:16.270
Or are my eyes
playing with me

02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:21.792
I spent many nights
on my knees praying

02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:25.758
From the side effects
of all this heat

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:29.837
But I'm telling y'all
it does feel amazing

02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:32.793
Or are my eyes
playing with me

02:06:33.305 --> 02:06:39.345
