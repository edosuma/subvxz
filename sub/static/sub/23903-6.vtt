She tried to have me killed.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.659
She's a cop.

01:58.702 --> 01:59.660
She may have been many things,

01:59.703 --> 02:00.994

Who else? She runs the Vipers!

05:03.012 --> 05:05.137
They wouldn't have done itwitho.

We need to pick her upand put t.

There are concernsabout the si.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.880
Well, make the issue go away..

05:39.923 --> 05:42.382
To do that, there's only one.

05:42.426 --> 05:43.842
Melvin Carter.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.595
Number three positionat the FDA,

05:46.638 --> 05:47.512
retiring in two months.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.140
Fine. Good. Great.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.725
Let's reach out to himbefore he.

05:51.769 --> 05:52.929
Offer him a golden handshake.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.980
Christ.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.361
FBI's here.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.030
Take them to my office, I'll be.

06:23.801 --> 06:24.903
If Mom won't listen to us,

06:24.927 --> 06:27.761
maybe we should get Dad to ta.

06:27.805 --> 06:29.032
I don't want him involved. If h,

06:29.056 --> 06:32.974
he never would've left her in.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.726
Listen, are we surethis guy's a?

06:34.770 --> 06:36.978
- He's a con man.
- Jesus...

06:40.943 --> 06:43.485
Because Dr. Faraday says it's.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.070
Totally unnecessary.

06:45.114 --> 06:47.030
It is toxic, and I know itmake,

06:47.074 --> 06:50.534
but chemo is still your best be.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.577
No, it isn't, Steve.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.748
Dr. Faraday's treatment works.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.667
And it doesn't wear me out or...

06:58.710 --> 07:00.752
Make me feel weak.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.338
And my hair stopped falling out.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.177
That doesn't mean you're cure.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.513
No, no. But I... I've met some.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.931
The ones he's cured.

07:12.975 --> 07:17.185
It's incredible! I mean, their n-

07:17.229 --> 07:18.549
They've got strong nails. This o-

07:19.565 --> 07:20.439
- So what does he do, he parades e

07:20.482 --> 07:22.274
in front of you?

07:22.317 --> 07:24.860
Tells you thatthey were his pats

07:24.903 --> 07:26.319
and they're nowmiraculously cur?

07:26.363 --> 07:28.947
Is that what he does?

07:28.991 --> 07:32.993
What? He's not the typethat wo.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.997
Okay.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.876
Well, if he has a cure,

07:40.919 --> 07:42.711
why aren't other doctors usin?

07:42.754 --> 07:44.838
Well, yeah, because of the matu-

07:44.882 --> 07:48.175
And Big Pharma, by the wa,

07:48.218 --> 07:50.969
are making fortunes offof other.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.596
So he's saving the world for?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.014
He can cure me, Steve!

07:56.435 --> 07:59.144
All the other doctorscould offe.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.979
Maybe temporary, maybe not at al.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.988
I trust him.

08:14.077 --> 08:18.872
Listen, Cole said thesetreatme?

08:18.916 --> 08:20.624
That your insurance won't covet

08:20.667 --> 08:23.126
because it's experimental.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.795
Insurance, they're in collusio.

08:25.839 --> 08:26.671
They're all ju... They're just...

08:26.715 --> 08:29.549
Sucking us... it's a racket!

08:29.593 --> 08:31.009
I know it's expensive!

08:35.974 --> 08:37.015
But it gives me.

08:48.654 --> 08:49.486
Look, the truthof the matter is

08:49.530 --> 08:50.673
any asshole can make a website.

08:50.697 --> 08:54.741
"Every human body contains it".

08:54.785 --> 08:56.576
Come on. What'd you find out?

08:56.620 --> 08:57.911
It's complete bullshit.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.871
Of all his patientsl reached ou,

08:59.915 --> 09:01.155
they're either dead or still s.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.085
So what are we gonna do, Steve?

09:05.128 --> 09:06.586
We're gonna get her back in.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.880
She's not gonna listen.

09:08.924 --> 09:11.007
This guy's already inside her h.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.551
He's already convinced her it'.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.682
There's something I needto han.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.016
Then we'll take care of him.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.987
Did you knowanything about thi?

10:19.578 --> 10:21.911

10:21.955 --> 10:23.235
Someone dropped her on my doors.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.583
Shit, it was probably your ol.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.668

10:40.807 --> 10:42.849

10:42.893 --> 10:44.133
They sent her back as a warnin?

10:45.354 --> 10:49.439
Okay, you got a point.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.982
But now it needs to be sharpe.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.695

16:33.535 --> 16:35.576

We pay for the best'cause he's.

You wanted the source of my ange.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.591
I don't know what else you wan.

18:13.635 --> 18:14.801
Talking about her aloud

18:14.844 --> 18:18.054
isn't necessarily processing it.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.973
I have been processing this.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.017
No. You've beenletting it cont.

18:23.061 --> 18:27.105
You've been letting her control.

18:27.148 --> 18:31.067
Are you willingto keep working?

18:31.111 --> 18:33.069
To learn how to take control oe

18:55.802 --> 18:58.010

19:05.770 --> 19:07.687
Steve's protecting you.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.064
Just let him handle Neckbone.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.150
Only way to handle Neckbone i.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.237
Like you killed Winters, right?

19:16.281 --> 19:19.532
Yeah, Steve told me.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.450
One down, one to go.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.535
Payback's a bitch.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.453
Enough of this shit.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.915
You're gonna start a war.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.750
Just slow your roll. We'll han.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.010
I wanna see which way they'r.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.639
Any reason why we couldn't t?

19:43.683 --> 19:44.932
I'm taking the club back.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.480
Dick measuring contest.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.524
Every girl's dream.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.059
You two needto make a choice.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.488
Where's Ramos on this?

19:59.532 --> 20:00.990
In Steve's pocket.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.411
So are we, Tom.

20:05.455 --> 20:06.455
Does she talk for you?

20:09.459 --> 20:11.876

Listen, with me, we earn as a c.

20:13.630 --> 20:17.006
I'm talking about cash payouts.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.723
Yeah, I know. I'll beat it. Alw.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.600
You're gonna end up in jail.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.352
So, I'm calling a vote.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.604
Me or Steve.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.689
You make the wrong choice,

20:33.733 --> 20:37.193
you pay for the consequences.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.724
She showed up a half hour ago,

21:08.768 --> 21:10.017
said she needs to talk to you.

21:16.859 --> 21:20.778
Who's she?-Says she's his wife.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.062
And she isseriously pissed off.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.750
Hamm and Ramos in the back?

21:34.794 --> 21:37.962
What am I, the receptionist?

21:38.006 --> 21:39.326
Do I look likel'm in the mood?

21:43.678 --> 21:46.012
Nope. Haven't seen 'em.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.816
Do you realize the danger you?

21:58.860 --> 22:00.140
How did you knowwhere to find m?

22:06.075 --> 22:07.950

22:07.994 --> 22:09.577
Anything you want to say, I'll.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.620
But I cannot do it now.

22:14.959 --> 22:18.002
What's this?-What do you think?

22:18.046 --> 22:22.006
Damon, you have not seen meor y.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.507
I never know where you areor if.

22:23.551 --> 22:24.737

22:53.498 --> 22:55.748
What do you got?

22:55.792 --> 22:58.167
Circled the block three times.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.669
No movement on the street, no.

26:06.816 --> 26:08.983
Straight?-Just give me a beer.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.705

26:22.748 --> 26:23.998

26:26.085 --> 26:28.711

26:35.595 --> 26:38.012
I got it.-Suit yourself.

26:41.559 --> 26:43.726
Jacking up a doctor.

26:53.446 --> 26:56.071
I don't think you give a crap.

26:56.115 --> 27:00.993
Whatever this is, it's personal.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.332
I hear you're trying to force.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.627
Force? Nah.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.045
Nah, they're ready for change.

27:11.088 --> 27:14.423
If they got issues, they shoul.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.508
Why would they?

27:16.552 --> 27:17.832
They don't have any respect for.

27:21.766 --> 27:22.556
I suggested you as the leader.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.017
My mistake.

27:27.438 --> 27:28.979
Time to fix it.

27:30.441 --> 27:32.900
Tomorrow night.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.986
I'm calling a vote.

27:44.538 --> 27:46.997
You with me, or not?

28:01.430 --> 28:03.138

What're we here for?

28:12.316 --> 28:14.900

She's disappearedsince I got gr.

28:16.445 --> 28:19.530
I want her found. Now.

28:19.573 --> 28:20.489
Look, how the hell would we kw

28:20.533 --> 28:22.408

28:22.451 --> 28:23.826
She's a Viper.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.120
You're talking to the wrong club.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.579
Find out from your boyfriend,

28:27.623 --> 28:29.998
or I'm bringing him in.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.625
He's also the only reason we.

28:31.669 --> 28:32.771
You think I give a shit?-Your.

28:32.795 --> 28:34.837
You're standing here.-Screw you!

28:34.880 --> 28:36.672
Hey, hey. The FBI can't find he,

28:36.716 --> 28:38.507
what do you expect us to do?

28:38.551 --> 28:40.008
Then have my back.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.013
Like I've had yours.

28:59.739 --> 29:02.865
He put a goddamn case on us.

29:02.908 --> 29:03.574
He could've made our lives a.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.159
This shit is his fault.

29:05.202 --> 29:08.829
He was kidnapped, and he still.

29:08.873 --> 29:09.621
Or tell the FBiwe drugged his s

29:09.665 --> 29:12.040
at the off training party.

29:12.084 --> 29:16.128
He's had our back, so, we need.

29:16.172 --> 29:19.256
Are you serious?-No. But if he,

29:19.300 --> 29:21.091
(it'll help us down the line. )

29:23.763 --> 29:25.012
It's Foster hitting me back.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.019
Tell him to meet me in 20 mi.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.729
I don't like usworking with th.

29:33.773 --> 29:36.023
Doesn't matter if you like it.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.025
He's the key to us getting rid.

29:41.697 --> 29:42.988
What're you gonna tell him?

29:47.578 --> 29:48.994
That Winters is dead.

29:56.629 --> 29:57.629
Put those right there.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.089
Nowadays, you can carry

30:01.133 --> 30:06.970
every single piece of musicever.

30:07.014 --> 30:08.639
But it never sounds as good as.

30:08.682 --> 30:09.973
That there isa technological prm

30:10.017 --> 30:13.894
that needs addressing bygenius.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.207
Maybe they knowit sounds like t

30:15.231 --> 30:17.856
and just don't care.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.651
Hammond. What you do, trade Ramn

30:20.694 --> 30:21.985
for a betterlooking model?

30:26.492 --> 30:28.784
You Winters' boy.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.744
Not anymore. She's dead, right?

30:30.788 --> 30:34.790
Good point. You get my answer?

30:34.834 --> 30:36.500
Winters wasdoublecrossing you.

30:36.544 --> 30:39.086
Playing both sides.

30:39.129 --> 30:41.922
We found a stash of WMD at her.

30:41.966 --> 30:43.674
So the Viperswas running game?

30:43.717 --> 30:47.886
Yeah, we didn't know, man.

30:47.930 --> 30:49.388
You lying to me?-Steve: He's n.

30:49.431 --> 30:52.057
Word is the WMD dealers havebee.

30:52.101 --> 30:54.977
But they still don't know whe.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.813
So we don't have the whole answw

30:57.857 --> 30:59.690
but best bet, when they found out.

30:59.733 --> 31:00.893
Winters was ripping them off,

31:01.819 --> 31:04.111
they thought she was doing itwi.

31:04.154 --> 31:05.988
So they killed herand dumped he.

31:11.954 --> 31:13.370
I'm being played, and I don't l.

31:13.414 --> 31:16.623
We hear you.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.166
Vipers want to keep the deal in.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.711
I'll handle shit from now on. .

31:20.754 --> 31:22.546
He's willing to give up the In

31:22.590 --> 31:23.797
of Winters' WMD stash.

31:23.841 --> 31:26.550
You take the WMD, you sell it.

31:26.594 --> 31:27.654
Pure profit. We take nothing.

31:27.678 --> 31:28.905
And with the dealers looking,

31:28.929 --> 31:31.096
it's only a matter of time bep

31:31.140 --> 31:34.683
and lead you to which oneof the,

31:34.727 --> 31:37.019
but also your baby brother.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.991
We got a deal?

31:53.537 --> 31:59.041
Yeah. We good. For now.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.626
All right, if you want someonn

32:00.669 --> 32:01.669
the storage unit for you,

32:01.712 --> 32:04.046
I can send a couple of my guy.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.409
It's mine. That's what I'm hear?

32:09.428 --> 32:10.428
Then you out.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.012
Hey.

32:54.056 --> 32:57.641
Why'd you shut me out of that jo?

32:57.685 --> 32:59.017
It's not the time or place, Be.

32:59.061 --> 33:01.937
We're about to have a vote. Se

33:01.981 --> 33:03.124
the best time to have a chat a.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.983
Can I haveyour attention, ?

33:09.154 --> 33:14.658
Um, I know my son, Steve, here,.

33:14.702 --> 33:17.911
But, I believe proof is

33:17.955 --> 33:19.496
in a man's actions, not in his w.

33:19.540 --> 33:20.600
So I say we skip that and move.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.582
Yeah!-

33:22.626 --> 33:25.460
- You know your choices.

33:25.504 --> 33:29.423
So, who's with me?

33:35.597 --> 33:37.014
And who's with Steve?

33:38.934 --> 33:42.019
Okay, by my count we have a ne-

33:42.062 --> 33:43.520
- Hey, hang on, Carl. Got somebode

33:43.564 --> 33:46.565
who hasn't voted yet.

33:55.659 --> 33:56.992
Is it me or your brother?

34:06.295 --> 34:08.628
Steve.

34:08.672 --> 34:11.422
You're back on top, Tom..

34:18.264 --> 34:20.974
You really think he caresabout?

34:21.018 --> 34:23.226
That's not the reason.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.020
What?

34:25.063 --> 34:28.899
I don't want youto go back to?

34:28.942 --> 34:31.777
If you run that shit again, you.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.235
No, I won't.-You never listen.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.155

34:37.034 --> 34:41.411
Now it looks like you'rethe one.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.996
You're full of shit!

34:59.723 --> 35:01.890
Sorry for your loss, Steve.

35:01.934 --> 35:03.642
Nothing personal.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.977
Of course it's personal.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.688
Just know the feeling's mutual.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.065
What's that supposed to mean?

35:10.109 --> 35:13.985
It means you and Tomdeserve ea.

35:16.907 --> 35:18.990

35:34.675 --> 35:36.007
Give her a second chance?

35:37.678 --> 35:40.137
Anyway, I think the Ravens

38:35.272 --> 38:39.149
with the street drug WMD, can y?

38:39.192 --> 38:41.443
Yes. Recently, the FBicame to e

38:41.486 --> 38:42.486
the source of WMD.

38:43.363 --> 38:44.112
Together, we followed the trail

38:44.156 --> 38:46.948
back to its point of origin.

38:46.992 --> 38:50.035
Dante Gardener, an exemployeeo.

38:50.078 --> 38:53.663
So you're saying Dante Gardenee

38:53.707 --> 38:56.166
for the drug's distribution?

38:56.209 --> 38:57.876
The moment the FBibrought this,

38:57.919 --> 38:58.793
we discoveredthat Gardener had n

38:58.837 --> 39:01.713
several test batchesof Restorin,

39:01.757 --> 39:03.882
a revolutionary new painkiller

39:03.925 --> 39:05.967
that we're aboutto bring to mar.

39:06.011 --> 39:09.929
He had cut Restorin withseveral,

39:09.973 --> 39:12.682
and sold it forhis own personal.

39:12.726 --> 39:15.018
And where is Gardener now?

39:15.062 --> 39:16.895
Gardener's crimeshave caught u.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.980
The police discoveredhis body a.

39:21.026 --> 39:25.070
It breaks my heart that Restor,

39:25.113 --> 39:28.615
which was designed to alleviat,

39:28.658 --> 39:31.117
would be used to cause it.

39:31.161 --> 39:34.788
Restorin is a regulated, highly e

39:34.831 --> 39:36.071
