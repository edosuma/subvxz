00:02.041 --> 00:05.008
"For all our days are
passed away in thy wrath,

00:05.237 --> 00:07.544
and we spend our years

00:07.579 --> 00:09.852
as a tale that is told."

00:09.972 --> 00:11.450
Follow the bones.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.302
Forgive me.

00:16.530 --> 00:20.547
The chances of any two prints
being alike are 1 in 64 billion.

00:21.340 --> 00:24.028
I am pregnant and unmarried.

00:24.730 --> 00:26.349
What is this?

00:27.194 --> 00:29.517
Theodore Swift is my business.

00:29.637 --> 00:32.205
Where, where might
he find safe haven?

00:32.325 --> 00:33.788
But of course,

00:34.416 --> 00:35.572
Father.

00:35.816 --> 00:39.985
I stay to bring all
to its conclusion.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:56.911 --> 00:58.975
Inspector Reid,

00:59.710 --> 01:02.662
explain to me once again how
it is you consider yourself

01:02.663 --> 01:04.043
fit for purpose.

01:04.367 --> 01:07.451
I have headaches, Mr. Abberline.

01:07.461 --> 01:08.841
What else do you
wish me to say to you?

01:09.247 --> 01:11.975
Perhaps that you
understand for why

01:11.995 --> 01:14.004
you suffer such affliction.

01:16.833 --> 01:17.817
No?

01:18.170 --> 01:21.722
You offer no explanation
as how it is that

01:21.842 --> 01:23.304
part of your anatomy

01:23.424 --> 01:25.029
ails you so,

01:25.820 --> 01:27.757
allow me, therefore.

01:30.161 --> 01:33.904
A man shot you in it.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.455
Warrant card... now.

02:00.330 --> 02:02.256
Your preparations
are made, are they,

02:02.290 --> 02:03.909
for Bournemouth?

02:04.355 --> 02:06.374
Well, they're not
my preparations, but,

02:06.494 --> 02:08.869
yes, they are made.

02:08.989 --> 02:11.222
And you would have me
invalided away from here

02:11.243 --> 02:12.806
before your journey south?

02:13.518 --> 02:14.577
I would.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.907
Do you now accept the
proposal I tendered you?

02:18.926 --> 02:19.926
Scotland Yard?

02:20.698 --> 02:21.568
I do not.

02:23.743 --> 02:26.658
Will you force me to
have you dismissed?

02:27.463 --> 02:28.807
Do you recall, Fred,

02:29.365 --> 02:31.397
the night we were
called to Miller's Court

02:31.624 --> 02:33.377
to attend the
remains of Miss Kelly?

02:33.948 --> 02:36.402
You believe I will ever forget?

02:38.356 --> 02:39.732
This was your chair,

02:40.538 --> 02:41.752
that was your brandy,

02:42.350 --> 02:43.512
and we drank,

02:43.632 --> 02:45.836
in the hope that those remains,

02:46.115 --> 02:48.430
the hard edges of
those images, stamped

02:48.468 --> 02:50.075
into our minds, that they...

02:50.361 --> 02:52.120
they might somehow be dulled.

02:52.976 --> 02:55.113
But there is nothing can dull it,

02:55.392 --> 02:56.574
not brandy,

02:56.801 --> 02:58.151
not Bournemouth.

02:58.271 --> 02:59.839
We spoke

03:00.086 --> 03:01.819
at night of how

03:02.682 --> 03:05.811
having seen his
acts in such detail,

03:06.629 --> 03:08.934
of how we knew them,

03:09.297 --> 03:12.063
as though they belonged
to us ourselves,

03:12.407 --> 03:14.692
how therefore we felt that...

03:14.812 --> 03:17.276
if only we might lay
our eyes upon him,

03:18.163 --> 03:19.581
that then we would, without

03:19.614 --> 03:22.626
proof, without witnessing,
without any evidence of any kind,

03:22.656 --> 03:24.286
we might look into him,

03:24.598 --> 03:25.805
and simply

03:25.831 --> 03:26.798
know him.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.569
What do you mean?

03:29.246 --> 03:31.778
Do you say that you have
found Jack the Ripper?

03:32.167 --> 03:33.372
No, Fred.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.645
But there is

03:37.324 --> 03:38.446
another circle

03:38.669 --> 03:40.632
I now see coiled about me.

03:41.931 --> 03:44.310
Another snake sent
to swallow its tail.

03:45.447 --> 03:47.498
Yet another Whitechapel evil

03:47.566 --> 03:49.498
whose scheme is yet
to be determined.

03:50.238 --> 03:51.676
And that knowing,

03:52.015 --> 03:53.287
Chief Inspector,

03:55.058 --> 03:57.948
the knowing
certainty of purpose,

03:58.392 --> 04:00.282
it slides into view

04:00.709 --> 04:01.639
this day,

04:02.251 --> 04:03.176
the next.

04:03.605 --> 04:04.664
It comes.

04:05.256 --> 04:06.440
And then...

04:10.138 --> 04:11.961
And then this work will be rid of me

04:12.081 --> 04:13.456
once and for all.

05:00.752 --> 05:04.684
<b>chamallow
addic7ed</b>

05:21.503 --> 05:23.756
Came over with the cattle, Mr. Best.

05:25.088 --> 05:27.140
Not on the passenger
line, Mr. Ackerman?

05:27.260 --> 05:28.677
Passengers get watched.

05:28.797 --> 05:30.344
Livestock does not.

05:38.950 --> 05:40.461
And I'm grateful to you, sir,

05:41.328 --> 05:42.720
what you have uncovered.

05:43.292 --> 05:44.528
You're a credit to us.

05:44.959 --> 05:46.372
To all we newspapermen.

05:47.312 --> 05:49.431
Well, I'm flattered, I'm sure.

05:49.551 --> 05:51.035
But, Mr. Ackerman,

05:51.295 --> 05:53.215
you did not bunk
down with the heifers

05:53.216 --> 05:56.142
all the way to London just so
you might give me the glad hand.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.189
I need your proof.

05:59.975 --> 06:01.356
And I yours, sir.

06:02.219 --> 06:04.281
I do not feed you
information for gratis.

06:04.312 --> 06:06.389
You were to provide in kind.

06:07.049 --> 06:08.295
Think I'd carry it out to dinner

06:08.296 --> 06:10.049
with a man I've
never met, do you?

06:10.733 --> 06:12.873
That evidence will be
hid for a while yet.

06:13.781 --> 06:14.929
Besides,

06:15.153 --> 06:16.970
trust must be earned,

06:17.190 --> 06:18.322
Mr. Best.

06:29.809 --> 06:31.227
Those who chase...

06:31.481 --> 06:32.510
you and I...

06:32.998 --> 06:34.681
this monster, Swift...

06:34.723 --> 06:36.858
the man we would bring down...

06:38.587 --> 06:40.389
he saw this done to me.

06:42.025 --> 06:43.375
The money he hid...

06:44.123 --> 06:47.109
the funds for which you searched
but could not find, sir...

06:47.229 --> 06:49.919
their journey to this city
brought death with it...

06:49.940 --> 06:51.129
55...

06:51.155 --> 06:52.391
man, woman, and child.

06:52.401 --> 06:54.276
Amongst that number,
one I loved.

06:54.343 --> 06:57.298
Now, you doubt my commitment
one more time,

06:57.335 --> 06:58.758
I shall take what I have

06:58.878 --> 07:00.327
and go to print alone.

07:06.222 --> 07:08.118
The thing itself in good time.

07:11.216 --> 07:12.242
For now,

07:13.236 --> 07:14.200
a sample.

07:24.846 --> 07:26.960
Those soldiers' tunics are red,

07:27.209 --> 07:28.726
if you have my meaning.

07:30.601 --> 07:32.434
And their deaths relate to all

07:32.439 --> 07:34.236
you would now elaborate upon.

07:37.431 --> 07:39.778
Something else for
you, too, Mr. Best.

07:42.116 --> 07:43.768
Its purpose will get
clearer, but, for now,

07:43.789 --> 07:45.653
I entrust it to you for safekeeping.

07:46.645 --> 07:49.164
Until we next meet, however,
you heed some advice...

07:49.641 --> 07:52.575
This dance you join,
it is a deadly one, so,

07:52.695 --> 07:54.092
you go now to
your place of work,

07:54.124 --> 07:56.117
you take what you need,
and you do not return.

07:56.216 --> 07:57.731
You do not take a step without that.

07:57.732 --> 07:59.093
You do so in caution.

07:59.296 --> 08:01.368
Fear is your friend, Mr. Best.

08:01.768 --> 08:03.300
Fear keeps us alive.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.380
I'll send for you again

08:06.400 --> 08:08.685
once a place of
greater safety is found.

08:34.774 --> 08:36.446
Okay, stop! Stop!

08:36.456 --> 08:40.097
-You seen him...
-Please, sir!

08:40.217 --> 08:41.847
if you see him,
you come and find me.

08:47.733 --> 08:48.881
Look at me.

08:51.327 --> 08:52.221
God!

09:01.964 --> 09:03.496
London.

09:03.533 --> 09:07.713
Remove the Englishmen, it
is not a city without appeal.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.636
Yet here's a thing...

09:11.379 --> 09:15.207
for reasons no doctor
has yet to clarify,

09:15.259 --> 09:17.451
when I disembark here,

09:17.778 --> 09:19.928
my bile rises

09:20.048 --> 09:24.181
with heartburn, Mr. Ackerman.

09:25.051 --> 09:27.921
We should tell you something.

09:29.363 --> 09:31.206
You think yourself
a plague to me?

09:31.225 --> 09:33.303
The reason I'm run
out of North America?

09:33.602 --> 09:34.907
You are not.

09:35.783 --> 09:40.250
I expand my empire.
Residing here suits my needs.

09:40.912 --> 09:44.333
I worry more after the fucking
half blood than I do after you.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.293
So, to business.

09:58.161 --> 10:00.927
I cannot think you come
here without encouragement

10:00.946 --> 10:03.065
in one form or another,

10:03.764 --> 10:06.820
without assistance
from some other prick.

10:06.822 --> 10:09.528
No. There's no one.

10:16.196 --> 10:18.636
God!

10:21.948 --> 10:24.025
Stop it!

10:24.051 --> 10:25.583
Stop! Please stop!

10:32.880 --> 10:33.902
And so,

10:33.904 --> 10:36.710
the encouragement.

10:39.826 --> 10:41.341
Who promises it?

10:42.208 --> 10:45.358
Tell me who, I won't
have you killed.

10:46.475 --> 10:47.344
All right.

10:47.410 --> 10:49.332
His name's Best.

10:51.539 --> 10:53.597
Fred Best of the Star.

11:07.523 --> 11:08.971
God.

11:11.048 --> 11:14.787
Thank you, Mr. Ackerman.

11:33.673 --> 11:35.224
Jesus Christ, Caitlin.

11:36.232 --> 11:37.679
Did you really?

11:39.708 --> 11:41.062
Jackson?

11:45.571 --> 11:47.496
Jackson!

11:50.709 --> 11:52.664
Open this bloody door!

11:53.300 --> 11:54.513
What?

11:54.922 --> 11:57.824
-A man cannot sleep at his work?
-Fresh corpse arrived.

11:57.944 --> 11:59.298
American, I'm told.

11:59.999 --> 12:01.447
Let's hope you catch it.

12:01.707 --> 12:04.194
His name's Ackerman,
sir. Ralph Ackerman.

12:04.454 --> 12:06.447
Reporter,
resident of New York City.

12:06.567 --> 12:07.888
New York City, indeed.

12:08.008 --> 12:10.536
-This ascertained how?
-He is not robbed, sir.

12:10.656 --> 12:12.767
His particulars still
on his person, therefore.

12:12.887 --> 12:15.657
Pages torn from his
notebook, but all else intact.

12:15.866 --> 12:18.178
His hands were roped,
boss. He was tortured.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.996
And then the coup de
grâce betwixt his eyes.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.651
Did he give them the answers
they sought therefore?

12:23.697 --> 12:26.359
Grace, hotels, boarding houses?

12:26.398 --> 12:27.852
No record of him, Mr. Reid.

12:27.972 --> 12:30.461
Well, here... left luggage
stub in his billfold.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.656
Not a large case,
and only a few items.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.576
He did not mean to
remain with us long.

12:34.696 --> 12:36.362
Tell him what else, Constable.

12:36.482 --> 12:37.178
Sir.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.958
He was seen... Rubensteins,

12:40.004 --> 12:41.945
an early supper
taken in the company

12:41.964 --> 12:44.009
of one who's well
recognized in these parts.

12:44.302 --> 12:45.675
Another hacker.

12:45.963 --> 12:47.366
Fred Best.

12:49.157 --> 12:50.859
Continue your work, Captain.

12:51.066 --> 12:52.933
Mr. Grace, get yourself
to the Royal Exchange,

12:52.943 --> 12:53.997
the Reuter office within.

12:54.013 --> 12:56.354
Every piece of reportage
our Mr. Ackerman's produced

12:56.355 --> 12:57.986
within two years, say.

12:58.505 --> 13:00.233
Let us find what preoccupations

13:00.268 --> 13:02.509
have brought him to East
London for so short a stay.

13:02.789 --> 13:04.046
Inspector Drake,

13:04.062 --> 13:07.288
it is an old habit, but let us
go call on Mr. Best once more.

13:13.234 --> 13:15.067
Welcome to Whitechapel, brother.

13:24.119 --> 13:25.692
Ransacked, abandoned.

13:26.549 --> 13:27.894
What of Best?

13:30.740 --> 13:33.189
Do we imagine they found
what they hunted for?

13:35.299 --> 13:38.285
The man himself,
or something he made?

13:40.875 --> 13:42.355
Whichever.

13:42.641 --> 13:44.615
We must assume that whatever

13:44.790 --> 13:48.951
investigation saw the errant New
Yorker Mr. Ackerman's brains put out,

13:49.549 --> 13:52.210
our Mr. Best is set on the same.

13:59.293 --> 14:01.585
It was your own,
was it not, Mr. Reid?

14:01.962 --> 14:04.461
Pocketed from the
man's obituary file.

14:05.117 --> 14:06.850
Read after you were shot.

14:07.070 --> 14:09.596
And now there is no
longer the need for it.

14:09.959 --> 14:11.212
So you hope.

14:12.329 --> 14:15.445
Mr. Ackerman, the ***.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.731
There is a view down
the street, as I asked?

14:46.399 --> 14:48.159
Our finest, sir.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.921
Let us hope so.

15:02.252 --> 15:03.856
The palliative farewell,

15:04.194 --> 15:05.466
all as it should be.

15:05.746 --> 15:06.648
Although,

15:06.973 --> 15:09.044
the time approaches beyond which

15:09.054 --> 15:11.683
any termination
would be problematic.

15:11.803 --> 15:14.516
There's no call to concern
yourself on that score.

15:18.062 --> 15:20.517
The likelihood of this
child being conceived

15:20.527 --> 15:23.424
even within my imagination
was so slender that

15:25.391 --> 15:27.358
no one's fate must be embraced.

15:29.253 --> 15:30.422
Emilia,

15:30.766 --> 15:34.148
for as long as it is possible,
for as long as it requires me to,

15:34.661 --> 15:36.433
find a story for the world.

15:36.901 --> 15:39.166
This is our secret, is it not?

15:40.926 --> 15:44.126
I do not wait my turn.
Not ever.

15:44.246 --> 15:46.776
And most certainly not here.

15:49.203 --> 15:50.904
Caitlin, darlin'.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.364
What use is this place

15:53.484 --> 15:55.152
if it cannot provide
so little as a

15:55.153 --> 15:57.655
fucking remedy for
the fucking heartburn?

16:04.361 --> 16:06.523
Where is it you take me, Theodore?

16:06.828 --> 16:09.191
Do you not think I have
matters to attend?

16:10.386 --> 16:13.534
We go somewhere a lesson my
girls practically been learned.

16:15.229 --> 16:17.586
"And what lesson
is that, Theodore?"

16:18.872 --> 16:20.930
A lesson my darling girl,

16:21.242 --> 16:24.864
that demonstrates just what the
future of Whitechapel will be,

16:25.040 --> 16:27.675
now you and I have reconciled.

16:27.928 --> 16:29.622
Reconciled...

16:30.023 --> 16:32.203
Well, what would you call it?

16:32.511 --> 16:33.985
I've been...

16:34.439 --> 16:35.796
co-opted...

16:36.101 --> 16:38.282
by organization ends.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.210
Well,

16:40.872 --> 16:44.572
this is what happens when you
thieve from your old man, Caitlin.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.233
This way, sweetheart.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.122
Where are they?

16:54.414 --> 16:56.089
Where are the men?

16:56.209 --> 16:57.842
All in good time.

17:01.705 --> 17:04.179
This Obsidian,

17:04.299 --> 17:06.256
you think to make it
an engine for good,

17:06.707 --> 17:09.106
but you forget who you are.

17:09.457 --> 17:14.079
There's nothing in your blood
to mark you out for philanthropy.

17:15.319 --> 17:16.772
Think of what

17:17.117 --> 17:19.241
energy and resources
you have expended

17:19.267 --> 17:21.130
toward the betterment
of this world,

17:21.415 --> 17:24.220
and yet your single
most notable achievement

17:24.259 --> 17:25.909
remains this,

17:26.675 --> 17:30.167
the death of 55 human beings.

17:32.496 --> 17:34.309
No, you are a Swift.

17:34.868 --> 17:36.504
No mistake of it.

17:37.655 --> 17:38.876
Now...

17:40.199 --> 17:42.673
This is what will happen here.

17:43.140 --> 17:45.042
Your workers are sent home,

17:45.081 --> 17:47.503
and this flattened
land is repossessed

17:47.623 --> 17:49.846
for an altogether
grander scheme.

17:58.922 --> 18:01.756
Remember just what
choices you have.

18:02.016 --> 18:06.667
It is my way or the
rope, daughter mine.

18:09.966 --> 18:11.524
Miss Hart.

18:12.913 --> 18:15.055
I was told to find you here, but...

18:15.756 --> 18:17.301
Where are the men?

18:20.242 --> 18:21.969
They're sent home, Jane.

18:23.916 --> 18:25.838
Forgive me, madam.

18:26.332 --> 18:27.831
We have not met.

18:28.533 --> 18:29.903
I'm Swift.

18:30.487 --> 18:31.714
Theodore.

18:32.835 --> 18:33.796
Sir.

18:35.648 --> 18:36.694
Pleasure,

18:37.024 --> 18:38.134
Miss Cobden.

18:42.542 --> 18:44.165
And why are they sent home?

18:49.053 --> 18:50.326
Will you say?

18:53.553 --> 18:55.688
Development is shut down, Jane.

18:58.447 --> 18:59.597
I'm sorry?

19:00.683 --> 19:02.746
The development is shut down.

19:02.778 --> 19:03.869
Why?

19:04.536 --> 19:06.193
Why shut down?

19:08.271 --> 19:09.972
'Tis too costly.

19:11.427 --> 19:13.433
And it will change not a thing.

19:14.258 --> 19:15.666
No, madam.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.621
This is a dream,

19:18.696 --> 19:20.834
some nightmare of ruin.

19:21.022 --> 19:22.386
'Tis too costly,

19:22.506 --> 19:24.684
and it will change not a thing.

19:40.796 --> 19:43.561
This Ackerman, he's
freelance it would seem.

19:44.294 --> 19:47.592
As all men of a free and noble
heart should be, Constable.

19:47.805 --> 19:49.934
Gazettes, chronicles,
heralds, and sentinels.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.601
Many periodicals,
and but one thing...

19:53.154 --> 19:56.124
the corruption of the powerful
governments and corporations.

19:56.331 --> 19:57.266
And one man,

19:57.420 --> 20:00.756
one business, the seeming focus
of his most recent articles...

20:01.176 --> 20:02.273
a man named Swift,

20:02.356 --> 20:04.669
a shipping concern named Swiftline.

20:05.175 --> 20:06.572
A case was even brought about

20:06.589 --> 20:08.030
as a result of his investigating.

20:08.192 --> 20:09.908
"A congressional inquiry

20:09.945 --> 20:12.850
after Mr. Ackerman alleged that
Mr. Swift himself gave order

20:12.887 --> 20:16.187
for a troupe of Pinkertons
to fire on the picket line,

20:16.224 --> 20:18.714
which he, Mr. Swift, had
engaged them to break."

20:19.578 --> 20:21.546
Now, do we think Mr. Best,

20:21.576 --> 20:23.726
a hacker from the
Star, do we imagine

20:23.846 --> 20:25.002
he has joined him

20:25.122 --> 20:27.225
in his campaign against
the man Swift?

20:28.590 --> 20:32.673
I don't know why you think I'm the
man to ask such questions, Grace.

20:32.927 --> 20:36.189
I've lived here, here within
crawling distance of the London docks,

20:36.193 --> 20:38.066
not those,

20:38.439 --> 20:41.194
in Hoboken. Now you tell Reid
it's clear what did for this man.

20:41.195 --> 20:42.113
Someone shot him.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.969
There's nothing else he need know.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.840
Constable Grace,
Wilkins up at the ace...

20:46.842 --> 20:48.910
he reports a man with
a China ear booking in.

20:48.911 --> 20:51.174
-Fetch yourself there, son.
-Pronto!

21:14.894 --> 21:16.961
A man named Ackerman
known to you?

21:17.244 --> 21:19.003
Someone shot him in the head.

21:20.742 --> 21:22.794
It's time we were elsewhere, Best.

21:39.276 --> 21:43.521
Ackerman, Theodore Swift,
everything you have... now.

21:43.641 --> 21:45.762
Or the next man
you see will be Reid.

21:46.950 --> 21:48.281
Indeed, Captain?

21:48.592 --> 21:50.194
What, you will take
me to him and listen

21:50.202 --> 21:53.247
as I draw a direct line
between the slaughter of the 55

21:53.539 --> 21:54.869
and your wife?

21:55.213 --> 21:58.185
Else why did you save me
from those men of H division?

21:58.830 --> 22:00.614
Could it be that, though
you were long estranged,

22:00.640 --> 22:02.827
you still feel the keen
urge to shield your wife

22:02.866 --> 22:04.409
from all which might
mean her harm,

22:04.411 --> 22:06.313
from the wrath of your
Leman Street colleagues?

22:06.346 --> 22:07.661
All right, Best.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.162
Your point's made.

22:10.519 --> 22:12.162
But I mean to know.

22:18.271 --> 22:19.868
Those are British soldiers.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.860
The Royal Niger Company, I believe.

22:24.963 --> 22:27.274
-And these connect how?
-I do not know.

22:27.715 --> 22:29.838
Mr. Ackerman was to tell me.

22:30.487 --> 22:32.085
These offered as

22:32.390 --> 22:33.370
a taste.

22:33.746 --> 22:35.655
A promise of what was to come.

22:39.284 --> 22:42.024
We had corresponded for
some weeks, he and I.

22:42.355 --> 22:44.199
He had looked but

22:44.205 --> 22:45.692
failed to find

22:46.056 --> 22:48.490
how Swift was
relocating his fortune.

22:48.828 --> 22:50.594
And so you showed him

22:51.379 --> 22:53.865
and demanded your
quid pro quo in return.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.448
We agreed Swift
must be here in London.

22:56.461 --> 22:59.272
Mr. Ackerman traveled to join
us, bringing, he assured me,

22:59.740 --> 23:03.222
the discovered proof of
just what purpose that man,

23:03.530 --> 23:07.010
his shipping line, and his newly
relocated fortune were now set.

23:07.822 --> 23:09.432
Do you know what this is?

23:11.757 --> 23:13.354
It's a stanhope.

23:14.555 --> 23:17.216
It is for seeing things
that might otherwise

23:17.479 --> 23:18.668
not be seen.

23:20.449 --> 23:23.799
Lunch, sawbones, and I have
a hunger on me, I tell you.

23:25.412 --> 23:26.694
Who are you?

23:27.162 --> 23:28.947
Her manners are normally better.

23:30.210 --> 23:32.914
Mr. Best, Miss Morton.

23:34.508 --> 23:36.750
Listen to me, darlin'.
I need a favor.

23:37.145 --> 23:39.107
One hour's all I ask. Only

23:39.763 --> 23:43.021
sit with him, make sure
he goes nowhere.

23:44.410 --> 23:46.461
Tis disagreeable as he looks?

23:48.751 --> 23:49.751
No.

23:50.725 --> 23:52.166
He's a good fella.

23:55.348 --> 23:56.672
One hour.

24:02.749 --> 24:04.183
Lunch, Mr. Best?

24:46.635 --> 24:49.063
Where is it, Mr. Ackerman?

24:55.064 --> 24:56.430
Where do you have it hid?

25:09.454 --> 25:12.102
Not a name we have heard
in some years, Mr. Drake.

25:13.056 --> 25:14.459
No, Mr. Reid.

25:14.491 --> 25:18.017
Fred Best fleeing him, eager
to avoid ourselves also,

25:18.056 --> 25:19.211
so it would seem.

25:19.224 --> 25:22.724
This... his unbonded
workers shot in protest.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.438
Were his culpability proved,

25:24.558 --> 25:26.242
he would face criminal indictment,

25:26.268 --> 25:27.456
and with that a jail term.

25:27.502 --> 25:29.717
His assets stripped
from him in damages.

25:29.718 --> 25:31.194
Quite so, Inspector.
And so...

25:31.577 --> 25:33.574
Facing such a fate,
the removal from him

25:33.622 --> 25:35.813
of his assiduously built fortune,

25:36.130 --> 25:37.894
does he perhaps
choose to ship it

25:37.901 --> 25:39.796
to an altogether
friendlier city?

25:39.829 --> 25:42.094
It must be shipped
in secret, however,

25:42.308 --> 25:44.502
and changed up, also,
into a currency

25:44.515 --> 25:45.989
which bears no sign of his owner.

25:46.009 --> 25:47.469
Unregistered securities.

25:47.589 --> 25:48.916
Bearer bonds.

25:49.274 --> 25:52.085
Shipped by anonymous
sea cans for London.

25:52.091 --> 25:54.902
Sea cans which are loaded
aboard goods trains.

25:54.930 --> 25:57.531
Goods trains which
then might be robbed.

25:57.739 --> 26:00.297
At gunpoint on the
tracks of Whitechapel.

26:03.543 --> 26:05.193
Do you not see it, sir?

26:05.777 --> 26:06.724
See her...

26:07.659 --> 26:09.094
the good Lady Hart.

26:09.886 --> 26:12.926
She's held to have
saved you. I know this.

26:13.237 --> 26:14.419
But the chances,

26:14.717 --> 26:17.476
the happenstance,
it is too great.

26:17.596 --> 26:20.794
That money, which her man
Capshaw plotted to thieve,

26:21.060 --> 26:24.260
it is her father's
money, Swift money.

26:24.695 --> 26:27.525
And we are to tell ourselves
she knew not one detail

26:27.545 --> 26:29.830
of that plotting
to rob that train?

26:32.271 --> 26:33.194
Now,

26:33.596 --> 26:35.375
do we go up there, sir,

26:35.959 --> 26:37.485
ask her direct?

26:40.912 --> 26:42.100
Yes, Bennet.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.574
I imagine we do.

26:48.931 --> 26:50.002
Make haste!

26:50.892 --> 26:51.949
Cellar to attic.

26:51.950 --> 26:54.835
Cash and bearer bonds.
Pull the place apart.

26:55.044 --> 26:56.388
Well, now.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.172
Mr. Drake.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.166
I knew it would not be long

27:00.205 --> 27:02.750
before we were to
be reacquainted.

27:03.529 --> 27:06.411
Bricks, Henderson,
Matthews... the upper floors,

27:06.531 --> 27:08.606
see them ransacked, thorough-like.

27:08.784 --> 27:11.151
At your service, Mr. Drake.

27:12.877 --> 27:14.888
And you, Inspector Reid.

27:15.689 --> 27:18.221
Are we not to have a
fond word of remembrance?

27:18.341 --> 27:20.526
In due course, Mr. Swift.

27:20.646 --> 27:22.058
I feel sure of it.

27:28.724 --> 27:30.437
He will fall. Help him.

27:30.690 --> 27:33.054
Water... bring it.

27:37.371 --> 27:38.170
Madam,

27:38.890 --> 27:40.098
there are those

27:40.585 --> 27:44.000
who would have me drag you to
my cells by your ankles, and yet

27:44.326 --> 27:46.780
it seems that I am in
your debt once more.

27:48.299 --> 27:51.070
There is no debt between
friends, Inspector.

27:54.778 --> 27:58.150
Since the moment those
engines fell into our world,

27:58.167 --> 28:00.134
we have asked ourselves

28:00.136 --> 28:02.445
why it is that none
have come forward

28:02.458 --> 28:03.854
to claim they were robbed.

28:05.353 --> 28:07.664
And here you,

28:07.784 --> 28:09.612
your father returned.

28:10.216 --> 28:12.598
The answer suddenly so simple.

28:14.403 --> 28:15.765
I wonder...

28:16.947 --> 28:19.732
are you ready to
make the report, sir?

28:20.193 --> 28:23.731
A man cannot report
a burglarizing

28:24.427 --> 28:26.760
if he has not been burglarized.

28:27.184 --> 28:28.762
And I have not.

28:30.112 --> 28:33.514
Explain your presence
here in London, Mr. Swift.

28:33.634 --> 28:35.397
I visit my family.

28:36.397 --> 28:37.825
You know a man,
name of Ackerman?

28:37.945 --> 28:39.013
Ralph Ackerman?

28:39.039 --> 28:40.883
Newspaperman out
of New York City.

28:41.003 --> 28:41.993
Of course.

28:42.564 --> 28:45.505
The man makes eternal
cause of blackening my name.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.719
Name the day you last saw him?

28:48.004 --> 28:49.430
I can not, sir.

28:49.751 --> 28:51.575
I never once met him.

28:53.737 --> 28:55.152
Nothing, Inspector.

28:55.272 --> 28:56.483
Not a bean.

28:57.709 --> 28:59.332
Save the safe in the wall, sir.

29:04.142 --> 29:05.227
Miss Hart,

29:06.519 --> 29:08.590
you will open your strongbox.

29:20.113 --> 29:22.341
You think yourself
absolved, do you?

29:23.366 --> 29:24.632
You are not.

29:26.047 --> 29:28.839
I see you, Long Susan.

29:28.959 --> 29:31.825
Dark and sharp as a midsummer shadow.

29:31.945 --> 29:34.779
Your lies, your
blood-blackened heart...

29:34.899 --> 29:36.325
I see you.

29:38.701 --> 29:40.207
But you cannot show the world

29:40.233 --> 29:42.291
what you see, can you, sir?

29:43.440 --> 29:44.557
Constable Grace.

29:44.609 --> 29:46.978
-Mr. Reid?
-Go now. Fetch two carpenters,

29:47.098 --> 29:48.452
two masons also,

29:48.572 --> 29:51.535
and when you have, see that
they then remove every floorboard

29:51.743 --> 29:54.462
and cut every stone where
that money might be hid.

29:54.508 --> 29:55.741
Yes, sir.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.243
I think

31:32.505 --> 31:34.888
your men might be done here, no?

31:35.641 --> 31:36.926
Don't you?

31:39.178 --> 31:40.684
My thanks, madam.

31:41.243 --> 31:42.704
Good day, Inspector.

31:44.534 --> 31:47.326
All victory is fleeting, Mr. Swift.

31:51.857 --> 31:53.454
Fear not, Caity,

31:54.402 --> 31:57.480
your papa will see you
another palace built.

32:06.444 --> 32:07.586
Sir.

32:07.706 --> 32:08.833
Come sit.

32:09.066 --> 32:10.748
Move through. Move through.

32:13.779 --> 32:14.844
Bennet...

32:15.428 --> 32:16.545
Bennet, I feel...

32:17.064 --> 32:19.005
I feel the earth shift and fall.

32:23.583 --> 32:24.965
Mr. Reid?

32:30.982 --> 32:32.412
Did you send for me, Amelia?

32:32.451 --> 32:34.561
Not I. He.

32:55.886 --> 32:57.815
How is he... the old man?

32:59.217 --> 33:01.710
He will see us all
into the ground.

33:02.027 --> 33:04.253
That's because he
deals with the devil.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.779
And you just opened
your doors to him.

33:08.538 --> 33:10.577
You believe I have a
choice in the matter?

33:14.445 --> 33:16.516
How much has he told you, Caitlin?

33:18.840 --> 33:21.314
Has he told you just what
business it is that he

33:21.346 --> 33:23.495
establishes for himself here?

33:23.690 --> 33:27.117
Nothing that man can
do would surprise me.

33:27.331 --> 33:29.415
Then why do you allow
him to kick back here?

33:30.648 --> 33:32.758
What does he have
over you, darlin'?

33:35.407 --> 33:37.160
I really need to tell you?

33:37.280 --> 33:38.842
I think you do, Caitlin.

33:40.075 --> 33:41.912
By way of example,

33:44.197 --> 33:45.723
have you told him yet

33:45.904 --> 33:47.592
how you shot Reid?

33:55.123 --> 33:57.844
I'm glad that you don't
attempt to deny it, Caitlin.

34:04.276 --> 34:06.023
How did you do it, Matthew?

34:07.392 --> 34:09.389
How did you discover me?

34:09.904 --> 34:11.786
It doesn't matter how I did it.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.527
How did you do it?

34:17.935 --> 34:19.396
It was a choice.

34:21.109 --> 34:22.485
A decision.

34:22.909 --> 34:25.777
As with all in this life,
a right turn, a left turn.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.677
You either choose or you
allow others to choose for you.

34:29.708 --> 34:31.781
And now you'll simply
just allow yourself

34:31.786 --> 34:34.487
to be folded back into your
father's life once more?

34:34.982 --> 34:37.409
I will not, but that
depends on you, Matthew,

34:37.625 --> 34:40.469
-on your choice.
-I won't lie for you.

34:41.302 --> 34:42.985
Not on this.

34:43.837 --> 34:46.231
You'll not protect me,

34:46.351 --> 34:49.851
as you once swore
such ardent oath to do?

34:51.289 --> 34:52.683
No?

34:57.042 --> 34:59.956
Then perhaps you will
protect your child.

35:04.988 --> 35:07.554
The night before I shot Reid,

35:08.031 --> 35:12.351
we two were like hot and wanton
dogs in a Whitechapel cutter.

35:13.934 --> 35:16.577
There was no other before,
no other since.

35:21.166 --> 35:22.647
The child is a new thing.

35:24.290 --> 35:27.179
It might make us newly excited.

35:31.184 --> 35:32.722
Choose, Matthew.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.270
Choose.

35:51.363 --> 35:52.538
Where is he?

35:52.658 --> 35:53.700
Gone.

35:53.940 --> 35:55.200
He would not be stopped.

35:55.252 --> 35:57.452
Gone? Gone where?

35:57.712 --> 36:00.076
He spoke only of going to print.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.478
That clown is going
the right way

36:03.510 --> 36:04.909
towards getting himself dead.

36:05.289 --> 36:06.886
Then perhaps he would
be considerate enough

36:06.897 --> 36:08.130
to show you that road also.

36:10.814 --> 36:12.827
He is quite the fountain of knowledge,

36:13.112 --> 36:14.566
your Mr. Best.

36:15.443 --> 36:17.488
Not a soul hereabouts
whose stories

36:17.491 --> 36:19.430
he doesn't have
cached away somewhere.

36:20.466 --> 36:21.907
You, for example,

36:22.996 --> 36:23.835
Matthew.

36:25.904 --> 36:27.196
Now, I never hid that.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.328
I gave you my name.

36:29.524 --> 36:30.852
But not your story.

36:37.044 --> 36:40.180
I didn't have you pegged
as judgmental, Hermione.

36:40.537 --> 36:41.648
I am not.

36:43.281 --> 36:45.861
But I know when I am
become an option for a man

36:46.085 --> 36:47.747
rather than his priority.

36:48.997 --> 36:51.469
And I am nothing if not
demanding in that regard.

36:54.482 --> 36:55.687
It is after her well-being

36:55.713 --> 36:57.252
that you now
chase around, is it not?

36:58.341 --> 36:59.446
Your Caitlin.

37:15.324 --> 37:16.479
She's pregnant.

37:35.468 --> 37:36.832
Captain Homer Jackson,

37:36.894 --> 37:38.282
there was a future for you.

37:39.628 --> 37:40.945
And in its stead,

37:41.273 --> 37:42.794
you chose the past.

38:22.501 --> 38:23.950
He is your friend.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.015
His troubles are not yours.

38:27.196 --> 38:28.196
Are they not?

38:28.558 --> 38:29.721
Mr. Reid... he...

38:30.539 --> 38:32.771
he cannot continue
as he is. He cannot

38:33.190 --> 38:35.891
police with the hurt
he now carries.

38:36.222 --> 38:39.446
And so Abberline insists
I now take his place.

38:39.804 --> 38:41.839
Take his place or copper no more.

38:42.641 --> 38:44.078
Not around 'ere, leastwise.

38:44.435 --> 38:46.600
How does that notion
now sit with you?

38:48.096 --> 38:49.501
Now that you and I are...

38:50.967 --> 38:53.106
Well, we shall be together,

38:54.078 --> 38:55.777
if I have you beside me, Rose,

38:55.981 --> 38:56.853
that chair...

38:57.821 --> 39:00.093
it would hold no
fears for me no more.

39:06.545 --> 39:07.646
I should get back.

39:08.091 --> 39:08.739
I know.

39:10.996 --> 39:13.882
I shall be here for
you later, however.

39:14.177 --> 39:15.531
I know that also.

39:17.001 --> 39:19.124
Watch your grinnin'
if you see Miss Morton.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.340
She and the captain...

39:23.054 --> 39:25.235
No longer, it seems.

39:25.355 --> 39:26.390
What'd he do?

39:27.566 --> 39:29.768
Miss Susan, apparently.

39:32.494 --> 39:33.183
Rose,

39:34.392 --> 39:36.253
will you tell me what
Miss Morton said?

39:37.135 --> 39:38.573
She said he

39:38.868 --> 39:41.539
left her to wait in his
rooms with Fred Best and...

39:41.551 --> 39:42.378
With who?

39:43.018 --> 39:43.919
Jackson!

40:31.046 --> 40:32.447
Mr. Ackerman...

40:33.336 --> 40:34.520
what did he give you?

40:37.737 --> 40:39.565
Do you mean amorously, Mr. Swift,

40:39.586 --> 40:41.099
or by way of disease?

40:51.449 --> 40:54.291
You're a spry fellow,
are you not, Mr. Best?

40:54.495 --> 40:58.022
Springing from one man's
pillar to another's post?

40:59.314 --> 41:02.413
See this mandrake,
this prick smuggler,

41:02.462 --> 41:04.066
may dance no more.

41:07.847 --> 41:08.782
No, no.

41:16.763 --> 41:18.201
Don't! Please! Please!

41:18.242 --> 41:20.689
I will... I... I will speak.
I will... will speak.

41:21.042 --> 41:22.372
You see, darling?

41:23.260 --> 41:26.008
He's not such an
unreasonable fellow.

41:31.965 --> 41:34.151
The floor is yours, Mr. Best.

41:34.177 --> 41:36.712
Let us end this dance
now, shall we?

41:38.878 --> 41:40.859
I know what Ackerman
did not know...

41:41.543 --> 41:42.935
not till I told him.

41:43.984 --> 41:45.053
I know that your money...

41:45.079 --> 41:47.692
that all of your money was
shipped here as bearer bonds

41:47.734 --> 41:50.034
to be cached away from those
that would bring you to heel.

41:50.037 --> 41:52.216
I know that she,
your daughter...

41:53.000 --> 41:55.369
that she saw a tranche
robbed from you.

41:56.522 --> 41:59.570
You shared this information
with Mr. Ackerman?

42:00.141 --> 42:03.054
And in return, Mr. Best,

42:04.010 --> 42:05.407
what did he give you?

42:05.885 --> 42:09.026
What did he pass you
in that kike kook shop?

42:09.374 --> 42:12.096
No. There...
there was no time.

42:12.101 --> 42:13.378
He was not able.

42:13.498 --> 42:14.893
After all that effort,

42:15.013 --> 42:16.634
both his and yours?

42:17.263 --> 42:19.506
I do not believe you, Mr. Best.

42:20.872 --> 42:24.056
I am, however, of
a mind to show you.

42:26.086 --> 42:27.135
This

42:27.758 --> 42:29.462
is a British gun,

42:30.054 --> 42:31.638
built for the
conquest of all those

42:31.659 --> 42:33.379
who would stand
in Britain's way.

42:34.172 --> 42:35.164
Well,

42:35.684 --> 42:37.096
I'm buying them now.

42:37.485 --> 42:39.948
And selling them, too.

42:40.784 --> 42:42.238
To all those

42:42.856 --> 42:47.156
who would see such weaponry
turned back on its creator,

42:48.392 --> 42:50.953
myself, my shipping lines,

42:51.436 --> 42:54.910
we shall prove an
effective quartermaster.

42:58.147 --> 42:58.957
But...

43:00.063 --> 43:01.502
Why would you tell me

43:02.463 --> 43:03.678
this if you...?

43:04.119 --> 43:06.014
If I do not mean to kill you?

43:08.839 --> 43:09.721
Well,

43:10.121 --> 43:11.414
who can tell?

43:12.827 --> 43:16.249
Perhaps I am vainglorious.

43:16.991 --> 43:18.010
But, see,

43:19.101 --> 43:20.711
I shall certainly kill you

43:20.919 --> 43:22.077
if you do not speak

43:22.119 --> 43:25.432
of who else you have shared
your hard-won knowledge with.

43:32.569 --> 43:33.543
Please,

43:33.663 --> 43:34.900
Mr. Best,

43:35.297 --> 43:37.991
he is in earnest
and must be indulged.

43:40.250 --> 43:42.146
You must save yourself.

43:45.307 --> 43:46.878
Must I now?

43:50.481 --> 43:52.747
Which names would you have, sir?

43:53.584 --> 43:56.557
Why, all, Mr. Best.

44:04.830 --> 44:06.336
I shall tell you.

44:08.217 --> 44:09.807
Only spare me.

44:10.483 --> 44:11.762
Tell me,

44:12.807 --> 44:14.885
and we shall see about that.

44:19.494 --> 44:22.961
I have told multitudes,
Mr. Swift.

44:23.714 --> 44:25.837
I have told bin rakers,
I have told sweeps,

44:25.844 --> 44:27.289
I have told every street Arab

44:27.315 --> 44:29.830
and mudlark from the
Thames to the Old Nichol,

44:29.887 --> 44:32.510
from the city gates
to the old forgery...

44:38.040 --> 44:40.855
coal-whippers, lumberers,
watermen, coachmen,

44:40.896 --> 44:43.675
churls, flower girls,
trotter scrapers!

44:43.706 --> 44:45.482
I have whispered in their ears!

44:45.508 --> 44:47.705
I have howled it
across tap rooms!

44:48.017 --> 44:50.723
And what is it you have told?

44:51.019 --> 44:52.230
What indeed?

44:54.059 --> 44:56.350
I shall tell you what
Fred Best, in his love,

44:56.366 --> 44:58.547
in his benediction
for each and every soul

44:59.015 --> 45:00.646
who must scrape

45:00.693 --> 45:03.912
and connive their way to this
benighted part of the world,

45:05.257 --> 45:07.278
this is what he told them.

45:16.455 --> 45:18.875
That Mr. Theodore Patrick Swift

45:19.960 --> 45:22.848
longs for nothing more in his life

45:23.912 --> 45:26.338
than a proud cock in one hole

45:26.369 --> 45:29.511
whilst he suckles from
another in the other.

45:33.588 --> 45:35.364
You know, Mr. Best,

45:35.945 --> 45:39.031
I have not killed a
man in nigh on 15 years!

45:39.099 --> 45:41.836
No, Theodore! No!

46:08.011 --> 46:09.938
<i>Sometimes Pa says with a frown</i>

46:09.985 --> 46:11.947
<i>soon you'll have to settle down</i>

46:11.973 --> 46:13.879
<i>have to wear your wedding gown</i>

46:13.911 --> 46:15.853
<i>be the strictest wife in town</i>

46:15.869 --> 46:17.728
<i>well, it must come by and by</i>

46:17.744 --> 46:19.811
<i>when wed, to keep
quiet, I'll try</i>

46:19.813 --> 46:21.646
<i>but till then I shall not sigh</i>

46:21.648 --> 46:23.281
<i>I shall still go in for my</i>

46:24.014 --> 46:25.707
<i>Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay</i>

46:25.827 --> 46:27.453
<i>Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay</i>

46:27.505 --> 46:29.483
<i>Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay</i>

46:29.499 --> 46:31.644
<i>Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay</i>

46:31.675 --> 46:33.648
<i>Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay</i>

46:33.658 --> 46:35.442
<i>Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay</i>

46:35.496 --> 46:37.417
<i>Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay</i>

46:37.433 --> 46:39.199
<i>Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay</i>

46:45.251 --> 46:46.847
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

46:46.904 --> 46:48.251
TrÃ¨s magnifique!

46:49.472 --> 46:50.895
Bravo!

46:51.077 --> 46:52.651
Bravo!

46:57.351 --> 46:58.832
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't urgent.

46:58.884 --> 47:00.078
But... Drake.

47:00.410 --> 47:01.645
I need to find Drake.

47:02.088 --> 47:04.561
-Best has disappeared.
-He's not here, Captain.

47:04.633 --> 47:06.410
Superbe! Superbe!

47:06.436 --> 47:07.707
Mademoiselle Erskine!

47:07.744 --> 47:09.027
Delighted to welcome you, sir.

47:09.047 --> 47:10.034
Bonsoir.

47:10.455 --> 47:11.930
Benny.

47:11.957 --> 47:13.800
Enchanté, mademoiselle. Enchanté.

47:13.859 --> 47:15.462
See now, Captain, he comes.

47:16.220 --> 47:18.678
Drake, listen to me...

47:18.920 --> 47:20.063
you must hear me.

47:20.183 --> 47:21.131
Must I?

47:21.564 --> 47:23.382
Then it needs be outside, renegade,

47:23.386 --> 47:25.750
-for I will not mar this night here.
-Renegade?

47:26.418 --> 47:27.632
Why is it you must forever

47:27.649 --> 47:28.771
seek to curse me?

47:30.170 --> 47:31.432
I found what you hide.

47:31.434 --> 47:33.125
I know you conspire against us.

47:33.499 --> 47:34.940
Shit.

47:41.054 --> 47:42.097
You come here!

47:42.118 --> 47:43.718
Wait, Drake, you don't understand.

47:44.250 --> 47:45.612
It's Swift.

47:46.688 --> 47:47.868
Theodore Swift.

47:47.884 --> 47:48.890
I know who it is!

47:49.276 --> 47:50.431
Let me explain.

47:50.456 --> 47:52.380
Benny! Benny!

47:53.036 --> 47:53.920
Benny!

47:54.196 --> 47:55.558
But, Drake, I know
what you're doing.

47:56.514 --> 47:58.114
And I know what you do.

48:00.489 --> 48:02.047
*** need to be trusted.

48:09.352 --> 48:10.898
Well done, Inspector.

48:14.577 --> 48:16.806
But then I hate to
disappoint you, Drake.

48:30.475 --> 48:34.490
You, Captain, are arrested.

48:42.265 --> 48:45.149
Under what charge is this
man arrested, Inspector Drake?

48:46.080 --> 48:47.948
Obstruction of justice.

48:48.068 --> 48:49.302
The case?

48:49.685 --> 48:51.070
Attempted murder.

48:56.885 --> 48:57.911
Whose?

48:58.976 --> 49:00.644
Yours, Mr. Reid.

49:01.709 --> 49:02.910
Ask him, sir.

49:03.105 --> 49:04.955
Ask him who he protects.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.669
I am not sure I need to.

49:09.831 --> 49:12.902
For now there are other
priorities currently upon us.

49:13.597 --> 49:15.246
With me, gentlemen.

49:27.656 --> 49:29.963
Jeez.

49:32.553 --> 49:34.903
Jesus, Best.

49:40.858 --> 49:42.007
Where?

49:44.364 --> 49:47.338
The same tip on which
Mr. Ackerman was found.

50:21.338 --> 50:22.337
It is Swift.

50:22.521 --> 50:24.001
You know this how?

50:24.689 --> 50:27.476
You see the geometry
of the ballistics here?

50:27.680 --> 50:30.033
That's not many weapons, but one.

50:30.571 --> 50:32.599
The Maxim machine gun.

50:33.573 --> 50:36.661
The new weapon of choice
for our imperial forces.

50:36.667 --> 50:38.220
No longer just that.

50:42.900 --> 50:45.198
Drake, the belongings
you took from my rooms...

50:45.627 --> 50:46.873
might I have them?

50:49.794 --> 50:50.625
Please.

50:51.433 --> 50:53.547
You both want to see this.

51:05.304 --> 51:07.229
You know what this is, don't you, Reid?

51:07.238 --> 51:09.544
Yes. It is a stanhope.

51:10.635 --> 51:13.356
Magnifying device, very powerful.

51:14.317 --> 51:17.180
It enables the viewing
of micro-photographs.

51:17.219 --> 51:19.274
There's a cargo manifest also.

51:19.531 --> 51:21.751
It records Swift's shipments,

51:21.946 --> 51:25.522
from which he supplies
anti-imperialist forces worldwide.

51:25.925 --> 51:29.351
Anti-British to the Niger,
anti-French to North Africa.

51:29.878 --> 51:32.592
Anti-U.S. to the Philippines.

51:34.442 --> 51:36.734
These weapons are stockpiled
here in East London,

51:36.778 --> 51:38.337
and sold to whoever bids highest

51:38.721 --> 51:40.954
or to who might point
such weapons

51:40.970 --> 51:42.831
at whoever it is he disdains.

51:44.837 --> 51:47.270
My father-in-law trades in death now.

51:48.200 --> 51:51.453
And he chooses Whitechapel
as his command center.

51:53.005 --> 51:54.231
Well, can we take him?

51:54.276 --> 51:56.068
Can we tie him to these?

51:56.776 --> 51:59.314
By motive, but there's
nothing physical I can see.

52:00.372 --> 52:01.956
Then we will require

52:02.307 --> 52:05.332
an informant, someone who
might speak against him.

52:07.397 --> 52:09.175
What he accuses you of...

52:09.429 --> 52:10.558
'tis true?

52:14.950 --> 52:15.990
It is.

52:17.427 --> 52:18.797
Go on.

52:20.790 --> 52:22.887
It is Susan's thumbprint

52:24.309 --> 52:25.759
on the gun that shot you.

52:31.433 --> 52:33.106
You removed it?

52:33.638 --> 52:35.320
You matched it.

52:41.677 --> 52:44.668
I think I must go speak to
her, see if such a proving

52:44.846 --> 52:46.849
may bring her to our course.

52:51.272 --> 52:53.909
You do not ask how or for why,

52:54.365 --> 52:56.086
but it is yours.

52:56.294 --> 52:57.533
A fund for the clinic.

52:57.553 --> 53:00.117
That it might develop as you see fit.

53:00.974 --> 53:01.831
This...

53:02.857 --> 53:04.500
more important.

53:10.973 --> 53:12.258
Miss Susan...

53:12.842 --> 53:13.974
Just...

53:14.796 --> 53:16.387
why would you abandon us?

53:16.893 --> 53:18.600
It is not an abandoning.

53:19.360 --> 53:21.028
It is only your sovereignty.

53:21.703 --> 53:23.417
Yours, Dr. Frayn.

53:23.962 --> 53:25.105
No soul,

53:25.225 --> 53:27.611
no man to say
what may or may not

53:27.637 --> 53:29.390
be done within these walls.

53:30.170 --> 53:31.410
Only you.

53:38.427 --> 53:40.141
Good morning, Miss Susan.

53:41.180 --> 53:42.945
Good morning, Mathilda.

53:45.763 --> 53:48.918
I am astonished, madam,
that you would come here now.

53:49.302 --> 53:50.510
Might we speak?

53:51.567 --> 53:52.788
Please, Jane.

54:01.499 --> 54:02.732
For earlier,

54:04.247 --> 54:05.974
It is too hard to explain

54:06.007 --> 54:07.318
but I am so,

54:07.753 --> 54:09.230
so sorry.

54:10.375 --> 54:13.049
For much else besides, but I hope...

54:18.411 --> 54:19.430
This.

54:20.157 --> 54:22.007
It removes the tenement lands

54:22.033 --> 54:24.824
from the title of Obsidian
and transfers it to yours.

54:31.329 --> 54:34.133
-I...
-Please, Jane, only listen.

54:34.575 --> 54:37.384
Where I have failed,
you must now succeed.

54:37.385 --> 54:38.819
Do you understand?

54:46.006 --> 54:47.797
Goodbye, Mathilda.

54:49.732 --> 54:51.166
Goodbye, Miss Susan.

54:51.673 --> 54:52.880
Be...

54:55.619 --> 54:57.229
Be good for your father.

55:22.867 --> 55:25.095
I let myself in. Your girl...

55:25.524 --> 55:26.828
I've sent her away.

55:27.965 --> 55:29.206
And your father?

55:30.468 --> 55:32.934
He now takes up the
suite at the Athenaeum.

55:34.337 --> 55:36.346
I cannot let you leave, madam.

55:40.672 --> 55:42.386
The surgeon has told you, then.

55:43.066 --> 55:44.479
Not by his own choosing.

55:44.520 --> 55:46.566
He was discovered,
and Inspector Drake

55:47.087 --> 55:48.702
has a way of extracting the truth.

55:48.822 --> 55:50.214
Please, Inspector,

55:50.904 --> 55:52.951
do not perform a dance for him.

55:53.195 --> 55:54.260
No dance.

55:55.402 --> 55:57.059
Your Mr. Judge,

55:57.635 --> 55:58.669
so long as I have known him,

55:58.700 --> 55:59.957
his actions have had many a root,

55:59.962 --> 56:01.479
but a black heart is not one.

56:01.894 --> 56:03.323
A black heart?

56:05.702 --> 56:07.566
If only it were so simple.

56:08.756 --> 56:11.805
You might hunt out villainy
with ease, fill your cells,

56:12.335 --> 56:13.883
and allow the good
people of this earth

56:13.914 --> 56:16.152
to walk forever unmolested.

56:17.465 --> 56:18.827
There are times, however,

56:18.858 --> 56:21.288
when it is perhaps
as simple as all that.

56:23.553 --> 56:25.074
One looks at another man

56:25.105 --> 56:26.248
and knows

56:27.058 --> 56:30.184
that he is for nought but
iniquity in this world.

56:31.639 --> 56:33.208
In many ways, it is a gift

56:33.374 --> 56:34.605
to be shown such,

56:34.973 --> 56:37.280
a gift we should not
run from but welcome.

56:39.362 --> 56:40.380
My life,

56:40.983 --> 56:43.790
Miss Susan, a
policeman's life, we look for

56:44.291 --> 56:45.356
pattern

56:46.600 --> 56:49.471
to show us our path. Pattern, form,

56:50.396 --> 56:51.857
a design.

56:52.133 --> 56:53.651
And so here

56:54.073 --> 56:56.070
I offer you one such.

56:57.181 --> 56:58.098
You

56:58.553 --> 57:03.366
and your Mr. Capshaw set men
to thieve from your father.

57:12.353 --> 57:14.856
The cataclysm that ensued

57:15.424 --> 57:17.169
sees Mr. Buckley

57:17.289 --> 57:18.532
and his wife

57:19.068 --> 57:21.762
bankrupted. And in
that bankrupting,

57:22.291 --> 57:25.902
Obsidian Estates
absorbs their shop

57:26.478 --> 57:29.359
and so reveals the discovery
of all that lay within...

57:30.511 --> 57:32.012
my daughter.

57:34.742 --> 57:36.176
Pattern.

57:37.278 --> 57:39.405
But design, Inspector?

57:40.663 --> 57:42.100
Whose?

57:42.335 --> 57:43.804
Who can say?

57:44.242 --> 57:45.967
But was it mere accident

57:45.995 --> 57:48.900
that saw neither of your
shots hit their mark?

57:52.794 --> 57:55.732
It was my husband
taught me to shoot.

57:57.599 --> 58:00.299
And I do not think him
inaccurate in his teaching.

58:00.301 --> 58:01.529
Unless, of course, he thought

58:01.535 --> 58:03.836
that one day you might
have cause to shoot at him.

58:08.710 --> 58:10.342
I wonder, do you...

58:10.695 --> 58:12.185
do you consider us

58:12.408 --> 58:15.046
tragedians caught in some farce?

58:15.987 --> 58:16.905
Because you,

58:16.916 --> 58:18.380
despite the concessions
you have made

58:18.390 --> 58:20.930
to survive in this
world of ours, I know

58:21.538 --> 58:23.848
your intentions have been
for the benefit of all.

58:25.194 --> 58:27.588
And yet one act damns me.

58:29.697 --> 58:31.198
I take from a man...

58:31.866 --> 58:33.437
my cruel father...

58:33.735 --> 58:35.592
whose money is made
on nothing more

58:35.597 --> 58:37.872
than the blood and toil of others,

58:38.812 --> 58:41.668
and then I am drowned
in a tide of slaughter.

58:43.621 --> 58:45.787
I think of nothing but
the protection of my world

58:45.807 --> 58:47.515
from a man who

58:47.977 --> 58:50.683
ripped the sex and entrails

58:50.704 --> 58:51.851
from five young women,

58:52.355 --> 58:54.521
and in my fevered pursuit,
my eye is turned,

58:54.558 --> 58:55.939
and my daughter...

58:56.760 --> 58:57.606
lost,

58:58.572 --> 58:59.377
gone.

59:00.025 --> 59:01.708
Caged in that cellar.

59:02.336 --> 59:03.193
Until

59:03.598 --> 59:05.582
your incidental calamity,

59:05.629 --> 59:06.787
by turns,

59:07.203 --> 59:08.510
brings her back to me.

59:11.824 --> 59:13.475
'Tis as you say, Mr. Reid.

59:14.140 --> 59:17.656
We are caught in the
teeth of some grotesque.

59:18.543 --> 59:19.925
Damned if we do

59:20.563 --> 59:22.484
and damned if we do not.

59:24.199 --> 59:26.806
We might act now, however,

59:27.424 --> 59:30.800
wrest some measure of
control back to ourselves,

59:31.304 --> 59:33.403
see good done.

01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:14.866
Caitlin.

01:00:19.296 --> 01:00:20.833
Why do you send for me?

01:00:21.306 --> 01:00:23.347
She does not, Mr. Swift.

01:00:24.712 --> 01:00:25.663
I do.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:31.033
Police, Caity?

01:00:32.108 --> 01:00:33.713
Have you lost yourself?

01:00:34.461 --> 01:00:35.764
No, Theodore.

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:37.707
Quite the reverse.

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:45.165
Kill this copper for me, will you?

01:00:54.944 --> 01:00:56.440
Good day to you, Theodore.

01:01:02.561 --> 01:01:03.524
You.

01:01:03.696 --> 01:01:05.295
You are finished!

01:01:05.471 --> 01:01:06.582
Yes.

01:01:07.215 --> 01:01:08.866
Mr. Swift, I expect I am.

01:01:10.077 --> 01:01:11.344
You see, there is something

01:01:11.355 --> 01:01:13.203
I have had too
many occasions to learn

01:01:13.205 --> 01:01:15.675
when a man such as
yourself is concerned.

01:01:17.114 --> 01:01:20.064
The law cannot constrain you.

01:01:20.874 --> 01:01:22.739
Too fucking right, policeman.

01:01:23.372 --> 01:01:24.188
So,

01:01:24.645 --> 01:01:25.923
you drop this now.

01:01:26.743 --> 01:01:29.268
Or prepare for the wrath of
god to fall on your shoulders.

01:01:29.294 --> 01:01:30.104
No.

01:01:30.473 --> 01:01:31.600
Because, you see,

01:01:32.644 --> 01:01:34.077
this is the lesson.

01:01:36.014 --> 01:01:37.182
Evil men

01:01:37.663 --> 01:01:40.150
need evil ends.

01:01:50.392 --> 01:01:51.602
What is this, Caitlin?

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:54.820
We... Inspector and I...

01:01:55.699 --> 01:01:57.646
we wish to show you somewhere,

01:01:58.665 --> 01:02:01.043
a place that has come
to mean much to us both.

01:02:01.708 --> 01:02:03.843
A place where a little girl was kept.

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:43.371
Down you go,

01:02:43.984 --> 01:02:45.058
Theodore.

01:02:55.122 --> 01:02:56.900
What is this place, Caitlin?

01:02:58.014 --> 01:03:00.450
'Tis the belly of Whitechapel.

01:03:09.336 --> 01:03:13.012
At your instruction, Father,
work here is shut down.

01:03:13.132 --> 01:03:16.041
There will not be a
soul through for weeks.

01:03:17.283 --> 01:03:20.032
You make yourself at home, sir.

01:03:22.811 --> 01:03:25.128
-You coming, Caitlin?
-One moment.

01:03:27.969 --> 01:03:30.768
For the heartburn, Father.

01:03:35.486 --> 01:03:36.642
No!

01:03:36.661 --> 01:03:37.843
No!

01:03:38.661 --> 01:03:40.452
Fuck you all! No!

01:03:41.114 --> 01:03:43.350
This does not end this way!

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:45.710
Theodore Swift
does not end this way.

01:03:45.729 --> 01:03:46.943
Then how, sir?

01:03:46.969 --> 01:03:49.611
It is only the suicide
chooses their conclusion.

01:03:49.637 --> 01:03:50.637
Caitlin!

01:03:51.247 --> 01:03:52.545
Think of what you do!

01:03:53.078 --> 01:03:54.064
I am blood.

01:03:54.467 --> 01:03:55.564
Your blood.

01:03:56.174 --> 01:03:57.973
It is your family you kill here.

01:03:59.213 --> 01:04:00.121
No.

01:04:00.901 --> 01:04:02.959
'Tis my family I keep safe.

01:04:07.196 --> 01:04:09.475
What make of woman are you?!

01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:11.630
I'm your father, damn you!

01:04:12.679 --> 01:04:14.499
I made you!

01:04:15.116 --> 01:04:17.187
I made you!

01:04:21.036 --> 01:04:22.224
Inspector.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.870
Inspector. Captain.

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:26.833
A fence from the
Wentworth Street hold-up,

01:04:26.859 --> 01:04:27.814
a runner come, sir.

01:04:27.878 --> 01:04:29.956
Constable Grace
brings him to ground.

01:04:44.596 --> 01:04:47.492
Yours, I believe, Inspector Drake.

01:05:46.617 --> 01:05:48.209
You make the choice.

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:51.520
I wish you well with it, Drake.

01:06:40.434 --> 01:06:42.033
For better or worse.

01:06:44.336 --> 01:06:45.453
Right?

01:07:18.128 --> 01:07:21.871
Congratulations
Mr. and Mrs. Drake.

01:07:30.324 --> 01:07:32.700
"London will remember
him for this...

01:07:33.057 --> 01:07:34.524
that he was the detective who,

01:07:34.537 --> 01:07:37.374
alongside Detective
Inspector Frederick Abberline,

01:07:37.588 --> 01:07:39.159
led the pursuit of the man

01:07:39.185 --> 01:07:41.671
we at the Star named 'Jack the Ripper.'

01:07:42.995 --> 01:07:45.800
but whilst his streets
might, in the years since,

01:07:45.852 --> 01:07:48.079
have found some measure
of recovery,

01:07:48.312 --> 01:07:52.091
it is this obituarist's fear
that Edmund Reid did not."

01:07:52.733 --> 01:07:54.720
I shall race you, my daddy.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:01.250
"If there is justice where
he now walks, it might be

01:08:01.276 --> 01:08:03.503
that the care which
he wore so heavily

01:08:03.548 --> 01:08:04.963
will be lifted from him."

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.592
"Those who knew him,
those who did not,

01:08:09.034 --> 01:08:10.533
those who may have only seen him

01:08:10.546 --> 01:08:11.942
stride past in pursuit

01:08:11.961 --> 01:08:14.298
of whatever villainy
beset him that day,

01:08:15.078 --> 01:08:17.265
he might offer a prayer for him.

01:08:18.142 --> 01:08:21.187
And this might be our prayer for peace,

01:08:21.375 --> 01:08:23.180
for his peace."

01:08:31.535 --> 01:08:34.411
"We, the children of the east,

01:08:34.807 --> 01:08:36.693
of the docksides, highways,

01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:38.715
rookeries, and laneways,

01:08:39.111 --> 01:08:41.151
we pray for the peace

01:08:41.456 --> 01:08:43.014
of Edmund Reid."
