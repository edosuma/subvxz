00:20.919 --> 00:22.987
Hi! How was your trip?

00:22.988 --> 00:24.389
Uh, what trip?

00:24.390 --> 00:26.323
Uh, w... your curtains
have been drawn;

00:26.324 --> 00:28.392
I haven't seen you
for three days;

00:28.393 --> 00:29.794
I just assumed.

00:29.795 --> 00:31.929
Oh, no, I-I've been here.

00:31.930 --> 00:34.098
Just took a
little stay-cation.

00:34.099 --> 00:36.333
Well, you look... rested.

00:36.334 --> 00:39.403
Hey, I need to
borrow your chairs.

00:39.404 --> 00:40.971
For the planning meeting?

00:40.972 --> 00:42.973
In an hour?

00:42.974 --> 00:45.176
- Sure.
- So you are coming.

00:45.177 --> 00:46.711
Uh! I told them you would.

00:46.712 --> 00:48.446
Wh-who told who?

00:48.447 --> 00:49.748
Well, some of our neighbors

00:49.749 --> 00:51.083
think you're a little distant.

00:51.084 --> 00:52.984
But I told them what
a great guy you are.

00:52.985 --> 00:54.886
Bring your chairs
to the meeting.

00:54.887 --> 00:57.823
Wait.
What-what are we planning?

00:57.824 --> 00:59.324
Ha! Good one!

01:14.308 --> 01:16.342
Oh, hi, mate.
What's up?

01:16.343 --> 01:18.044
What are you doing?

01:18.045 --> 01:19.879
It was a simple plan.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.547
I boost Bear
through the window,

01:21.548 --> 01:23.149
and Bear unlocks
the door for me.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.385
But someone turned out
to be a stupid ass!

01:25.386 --> 01:27.053
Oh, really.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.621
You twisted your ankle
when you landed. Bullshit!

01:29.622 --> 01:31.356
Get up!

01:31.357 --> 01:33.291
Fine. Stay there, then.

01:33.292 --> 01:34.459
Whoops.

01:34.460 --> 01:35.660
Well, move!

01:35.661 --> 01:37.528
Hey, buddy.

01:37.529 --> 01:38.663
Hey, mate.

01:38.664 --> 01:40.098
Haven't seen you in a while.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.167
I... just wanted some me time

01:42.168 --> 01:43.801
to clear my head.

01:43.802 --> 01:45.503
Okay.

01:45.504 --> 01:46.871
Uh...

01:46.872 --> 01:48.106
wh-what are they planning?

01:48.107 --> 01:49.307
At the meeting.

01:49.308 --> 01:51.176
You're joking.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.877
How could you forget?

01:55.481 --> 01:57.248
You smoked all this?

01:57.249 --> 01:58.583
Oh, shit.

02:01.187 --> 02:02.987
I'm a bit of a loner--

02:02.988 --> 02:04.655
it's part of my charm--

02:04.656 --> 02:06.990
but first and foremost,
I'm a pack animal.

02:06.991 --> 02:08.225
And so are you.

02:08.226 --> 02:09.459
I keep to myself.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.461
I'm not bothering anyone.

02:11.462 --> 02:14.463
- What do you care?
- I'm just curious as to why. Why now?

02:14.464 --> 02:15.965
Why are you shutting me out?

02:15.966 --> 02:17.433
- This isn't about you.
- Hiya, Wilfred!

02:17.434 --> 02:18.701
See you at the meeting, Gene.

02:18.702 --> 02:20.869
How do you know that guy?

02:20.870 --> 02:22.704
Oh, you mean Green Gene
the Gardening Machine,

02:22.705 --> 02:24.306
recently got a new hip?

02:24.307 --> 02:26.942
Everyone knows Gene.
How do you not know Gene?

02:26.943 --> 02:30.046
- So, what, I'm supposed to be friends
with everybody? - Ryan, Ryan,

02:30.047 --> 02:31.480
I'm gonna be straight with you.

02:31.481 --> 02:33.917
This isolating is
becoming a problem.

02:33.918 --> 02:35.552
People are starting
to think you're weird.

02:35.553 --> 02:37.921
"It puts the lotion
in the basket" weird.

02:37.922 --> 02:40.257
I thought you said it didn't
matter what other people think.

02:40.258 --> 02:42.493
About you, no.
About me, yes.

02:42.494 --> 02:44.261
I'm the only friend you've got.

02:44.262 --> 02:45.763
If people think you're strange,

02:45.764 --> 02:47.465
how do you think
that makes me look?

02:51.536 --> 02:53.471
Damn rain!

02:53.472 --> 02:55.073
- Wilfred, stop!
- Relax, Ryan.

02:55.074 --> 02:57.042
It's Trash Face.

02:57.043 --> 02:58.644
I'm not being disrespectful;

02:58.645 --> 03:00.947
I'm marking him
as part of their community.

03:00.948 --> 03:04.151
I'm also washing
the schmutz off his face.

03:04.152 --> 03:06.619
See, this neighborhood
is like a pack.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.422
A pack survives because everybody
looks after each other.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.157
We protect our own.

03:11.158 --> 03:14.861
But there is one that
dwells within our midst

03:14.862 --> 03:17.063
that is unworthy
of that fellowship.

03:17.064 --> 03:20.600
An evil... parasitic maggot!

03:20.601 --> 03:25.104
A creature so vile, diarrhea
holds its nose when he walks by.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.238
- Hey, man!
- Hi.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.741
Hey, Wilfred.

03:27.742 --> 03:28.942
Him?

03:28.943 --> 03:30.543
He's a warlock, Ryan.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.480
Don't fall for his
diabolical sorcery.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.382
Come here, boy.
Want to play ball?

03:35.383 --> 03:37.250
You really want
to do this, huh?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.451
Okay.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.786
Throw the damn ball already.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.987
Let's do this.

03:40.988 --> 03:41.955
Let's get this over with!

03:46.427 --> 03:48.194
Where did...

03:48.195 --> 03:50.296
I don't think Wilfred
likes this game.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.870
- Looking for this?
- Aah!

03:56.871 --> 03:58.171
It doesn't make

03:58.172 --> 04:00.407
any s...
it doesn't make...

04:00.408 --> 04:02.509
Andy?
Did you do your homework yet?

04:02.510 --> 04:04.645
Bye, Wilfred.

04:04.646 --> 04:06.680
Suck my dick!

04:06.681 --> 04:08.482
Hey, I like your
strategy, mate.

04:08.483 --> 04:11.919
Turn up an hour late--
makes us seem more important.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.321
Um, I'm not going
to the meeting.

04:14.322 --> 04:17.125
Good idea-- save the
magic till tomorrow.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.861
Tomorrow?

04:19.862 --> 04:21.797
Ah, the annual block party.

04:21.798 --> 04:24.232
That's what they're planning
at the meeting.

04:24.233 --> 04:26.034
Yeah, there's
gonna be two kegs.

04:26.035 --> 04:28.570
I'm not going, not this year.

04:28.571 --> 04:31.238
But Jenna's put a lot
of work into this.

04:31.239 --> 04:33.474
She even took me
to the groomer.

04:33.475 --> 04:35.376
Thanks for
noticing, by the way.

04:35.377 --> 04:37.245
Sorry, I'm gonna pass.

04:37.246 --> 04:38.813
Dude, come on!

04:38.814 --> 04:41.015
What's so wrong
with a little beer

04:41.016 --> 04:43.884
and some small talk with
the assholes down the street?

04:43.885 --> 04:46.152
A-And what am I supposed
to small-talk about?

04:46.153 --> 04:50.523
In case you haven't noticed, I don't
have a lot of good news these days.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.025
Look around, Ryan.

04:52.026 --> 04:54.394
Do you know where you are?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.029
Basement?

04:56.030 --> 04:57.830
Rock bottom.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.399
Go upstairs before
it's too late.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.000
You're playing with fire.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.268
What do you mean?

05:02.269 --> 05:03.702
Turn your back on the pack...

05:03.703 --> 05:07.506
and the pack will turn on you.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.708
Any dog will tell you that.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.830
Hi. I'm Susie.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.565
I don't believe we've met.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.834
R-Ryan. I live in
the corner house.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.004
Oh! Oh, it's so nice
to meet you. Doug?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.939
Doug, Doug, Doug, Doug,
Doug, come here, come here.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.641
This is Ryan

05:41.642 --> 05:43.009
from the corner house.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.210
Well, hey, stranger.

05:44.211 --> 05:45.945
We've lived here, what,

05:45.946 --> 05:47.113
- ten years?
- 11.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.648
Holy cow, 11 years!
We know everybody

05:48.649 --> 05:50.416
on the block, and
we don't know you.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.751
But I've got to admit,

05:51.752 --> 05:52.952
we've been curious.

05:52.953 --> 05:53.953
Well,

05:53.954 --> 05:55.621
Susie's been curious.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.257
You have.

05:57.258 --> 05:59.258
Oh...

05:59.259 --> 06:01.561
Well, I-I understand
why you feel that way,

06:01.562 --> 06:04.263
but... I-I've... I've
made a real commitment

06:04.264 --> 06:06.933
to get out there
and meet new people.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.136
- Oh.
- Aw...

06:09.137 --> 06:10.704
Wine?

06:10.705 --> 06:12.372
Oh. Thank you.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.774
- Thanks.
- Wow.

06:13.775 --> 06:15.809
This is... this is good wine.

06:15.810 --> 06:19.346
It was...
Fatty Arbuckle's favorite.

06:24.653 --> 06:27.388
Fatty Arbuckle.

06:28.890 --> 06:31.158
You're all right, Ryan.

06:31.159 --> 06:32.827
I don't get it.

06:32.828 --> 06:34.829
I'll show you later.

06:34.830 --> 06:36.597
Okay!

06:36.598 --> 06:38.165
Oh, Charlie, Donna, come here.

06:38.166 --> 06:39.733
This is Ryan--
he lives

06:39.734 --> 06:42.303
- in the corner house.
- Charlie's in real estate.

06:42.304 --> 06:44.037
What about you, Ryan?

06:44.038 --> 06:45.472
I-I was a lawyer.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.941
Oh, what happened?

06:46.942 --> 06:48.275
Oh...

06:48.276 --> 06:51.078
y-you know, I-I just, uh...

06:51.079 --> 06:53.481
What do you say
we open that wine?

06:55.951 --> 06:58.786
Answer the question, Ryan.

06:58.787 --> 07:03.624
W-Well, y... you know, I just, um...

07:03.625 --> 07:06.461
I-I had... some,

07:06.462 --> 07:08.496
uh...

07:10.132 --> 07:12.033
Who is that guy?

07:12.034 --> 07:14.569
I-Is it hot in here?

07:14.570 --> 07:16.004
Are you okay?

07:26.115 --> 07:29.050
Well... now we know.

07:47.770 --> 07:49.504
- Hey, Jenna.
- Hey.

07:50.873 --> 07:52.474
What's going on?

07:52.475 --> 07:54.375
Someone broke into
a bunch of cars.

07:54.376 --> 07:56.077
They smashed the windows

07:56.078 --> 07:58.947
and stole a purse,
a watch and Mr. Patel's laptop.

07:58.948 --> 08:00.616
- That's awful.
- Here's the thing.

08:00.617 --> 08:03.052
Some of the neighbors
kind of think it was...

08:03.053 --> 08:04.120
you.

08:04.121 --> 08:05.555
What?

08:05.556 --> 08:07.957
I say we string up the weirdo

08:07.958 --> 08:09.458
and lash him until

08:09.459 --> 08:11.327
he tells us what he knows!

08:11.328 --> 08:13.296
- Who's with me?
- Well, you weren't at the meeting,

08:13.297 --> 08:15.264
and your car was the only one

08:15.265 --> 08:16.799
on the block that
wasn't broken into.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.567
I mean, I don't
think you did it.

08:18.568 --> 08:21.037
You didn't do it, did you?

08:21.038 --> 08:22.905
What? No!

08:22.906 --> 08:24.874
I didn't do it!

08:27.611 --> 08:29.078
Bullshit!

08:29.079 --> 08:31.280
Bullshit! Bullshit!

08:31.281 --> 08:33.148
Bullshit! Bull...

08:33.149 --> 08:36.284
Hey, why am I
the only one with a torch?

08:40.866 --> 08:42.566
I can't believe this.

08:42.567 --> 08:44.535
Now they're throwing eggs at me.

08:44.536 --> 08:47.371
Why would people assume
that I'm the thief?

08:47.372 --> 08:49.907
Really? You're still
not getting this?

08:49.908 --> 08:51.876
You're the twitchy loner.

08:51.877 --> 08:53.878
The pasty neighborhood creep.

08:53.879 --> 08:56.347
And that's not me talking,
that's Mrs. Patel.

08:56.348 --> 08:58.616
- Is it possible I don't remember?
- You can't even

08:58.617 --> 09:00.384
remember a damn block party.

09:00.385 --> 09:02.053
You got baked and blacked out,

09:02.054 --> 09:04.489
then cut your hand
on a broken car window

09:04.490 --> 09:06.224
whilst committing
a series of burglaries.

09:06.225 --> 09:08.260
Allegedly. We need
to start saying that.

09:08.261 --> 09:09.261
I-I would never...

09:09.262 --> 09:10.496
Never what?

09:10.497 --> 09:12.298
Shit in your neighbor's boot?

09:12.299 --> 09:15.335
Have sex with a stuffed giraffe
in front of a small child?

09:15.336 --> 09:17.170
You'd be surprised
what we're capable of

09:17.171 --> 09:19.206
once we put our mind to it.

09:19.207 --> 09:20.940
"Our mind."

09:20.941 --> 09:22.376
Did I?

09:23.712 --> 09:24.878
What?

09:24.879 --> 09:26.480
What's so funny?

09:26.481 --> 09:30.384
Nothing.
This is very serious, Ryan.

09:30.385 --> 09:32.219
Wait a second.

09:32.220 --> 09:33.920
You did this.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.489
You framed me for breaking
into all those cars!

09:36.490 --> 09:38.424
Wh... What?!
That's crazy!

09:40.493 --> 09:42.460
And you drew a
penis on my hand?

09:42.461 --> 09:44.195
Gotcha!

09:44.196 --> 09:47.232
Oh, oh, you should see
your face right now, Ryan.

09:47.233 --> 09:48.433
Is this a joke?!

09:48.434 --> 09:50.302
Why the hell would you do this?

09:50.303 --> 09:52.104
Well, for starters...
it's funny--

09:52.105 --> 09:54.306
that's the laughter
coming out of me--

09:54.307 --> 09:56.976
but more importantly, now you
have to go to that party.

09:56.977 --> 09:59.845
Are you insane?
I can't leave my house!

09:59.846 --> 10:01.647
Don't you see, Ryan?
If you don't go,

10:01.648 --> 10:03.015
then they'll be
even more suspicious!

10:03.016 --> 10:05.050
Next time it won't be
eggs on your window,

10:05.051 --> 10:06.819
it'll be Mrs. Patel's feces.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.787
And that's not me talking,
that's still Mrs. Patel.

10:29.109 --> 10:31.877
Hey. Where can I put this?

10:31.878 --> 10:35.281
Joey, will you go get
Mommy another diet soda?

10:37.184 --> 10:40.220
You can put your baked
goods up your anus.

10:41.856 --> 10:43.724
Ryan, hey, you made it!

10:43.725 --> 10:45.659
Go home, you thieving
white peckerwood!

10:45.660 --> 10:47.694
Everyone is really
glad you came.

10:51.799 --> 10:53.233
This is pointless.

10:53.234 --> 10:54.867
You can do this, Ryan.

10:54.868 --> 10:56.970
You just have to put in
a bit of effort here.

10:56.971 --> 10:58.037
Follow my lead.

10:59.940 --> 11:02.575
Hey-hey, Gene.

11:02.576 --> 11:05.044
Digging the lime green Crocs,
mate.

11:05.045 --> 11:07.546
Wilfred, who's a good boy?

11:07.547 --> 11:09.114
- I'm a good boy.
- Oh.

11:09.115 --> 11:10.649
Obviously.
You, on the other hand--

11:10.650 --> 11:12.484
hot dogs
and potato salad?

11:12.485 --> 11:15.087
How many Weight Watchers
points is that?

11:15.088 --> 11:16.956
Uh, Gino,

11:16.957 --> 11:20.026
have you met
my good friend, Ryan?

11:20.027 --> 11:22.029
Uh... hey, there.

11:22.030 --> 11:23.897
I'm Ryan.

11:23.898 --> 11:27.000
Gene.

11:27.001 --> 11:29.035
I heard you got
your hip replaced.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.570
How's it feeling?

11:30.571 --> 11:32.472
Oh, not great,
but it's getting there.

11:32.473 --> 11:33.907
Thanks for asking.

11:33.908 --> 11:35.842
I'm sure you'll
make it through.

11:35.843 --> 11:39.413
I mean, you are Green Gene,
the gardening machine.

11:39.414 --> 11:41.781
What the hell
did you just call me?!

11:41.782 --> 11:44.517
Jesus, Ryan!

11:44.518 --> 11:46.719
What happened? I thought
everyone calls him that.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.221
Not to his face.

11:48.222 --> 11:50.556
He sliced his thumb open
in a gardening accident,

11:50.557 --> 11:51.857
and it got gangrene.

11:51.858 --> 11:53.225
He almost died.

11:53.226 --> 11:54.826
I can't do this.

11:54.827 --> 11:56.761
- Ryan, trust me.
- Wilfred!

11:56.762 --> 11:58.363
- It's only a matter...
- Hey, Wilfred.

12:02.301 --> 12:05.069
- As I was saying, it's only a matter...
- Wilfred.

12:05.070 --> 12:07.472
Want some food, Wilfred?

12:07.473 --> 12:10.342
Food, huh?

12:10.343 --> 12:15.181
Uh... uh, uh, I-I suppose
I-I would want some food, yeah.

12:15.182 --> 12:17.316
W-Why? What have you got?

12:21.255 --> 12:22.789
That is not food!

12:24.058 --> 12:26.626
It's a balled-up napkin.

12:26.627 --> 12:29.129
But I thought it was...
But how-how did he...?

12:36.736 --> 12:38.536
Well, this is so embarrassing.

12:38.537 --> 12:41.005
I thought you'd still be
at the party.

12:41.006 --> 12:44.074
Uh... it wasn't
really my scene.

12:44.075 --> 12:46.877
Why am I not surprised?

12:46.878 --> 12:49.213
Textbook loner behavior.

12:49.214 --> 12:53.884
Frozen TV dinners, many,
many of these crusty tissues.

12:53.885 --> 12:56.320
Aw!
And this.

12:56.321 --> 12:59.223
Only two calls last month.

12:59.224 --> 13:01.725
- That's really sad, Ryan.
- You know my name?

13:01.726 --> 13:04.761
I know your Social
Security number.

13:04.762 --> 13:06.363
You really need a shredder.

13:07.765 --> 13:09.532
You know what? Go ahead.

13:09.533 --> 13:10.934
Steal my identity.

13:10.935 --> 13:12.402
Have fun being me.

13:12.403 --> 13:14.604
Ooh.

13:17.041 --> 13:20.443
You remind me of myself
when I was a young man.

13:20.444 --> 13:22.512
Oh. It's encouraging.

13:22.513 --> 13:25.314
I came over here 1977.

13:25.315 --> 13:27.617
I didn't speak the
language back then, so

13:27.618 --> 13:31.187
difficult to make any friends,
so eventually, I stopped trying.

13:31.188 --> 13:34.558
Loneliness overtook me.
Depression.

13:34.559 --> 13:36.661
I ruined my life.

13:36.662 --> 13:41.366
When I die, it'll be
like I-I was never here.

13:44.571 --> 13:47.239
I'll be forgotten.

13:51.411 --> 13:53.612
Got a bit heavy there, eh?

13:55.115 --> 13:56.916
So this is my future.

13:56.917 --> 13:58.951
It doesn't have to be.

13:58.952 --> 14:01.854
Ryan, you need to reach out.

14:01.855 --> 14:06.325
Make a connection with
your fellow human beings.

14:06.326 --> 14:10.096
In fact, you can start
with me right now

14:10.097 --> 14:13.767
by letting me pull on
your junk for 20 bucks.

14:13.768 --> 14:15.235
I need some heroin, man.

14:15.236 --> 14:17.638
Ryan, there you are.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.140
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

14:19.141 --> 14:20.775
Bob and Shelly Reinhardt
are about

14:20.776 --> 14:23.145
to karaoke the tits
off "Summer Lovin'."

14:23.146 --> 14:24.646
See you around, Trash Face.

14:24.647 --> 14:26.048
What did you just call me?!

14:26.049 --> 14:27.449
Jesus, Ryan!

14:27.450 --> 14:29.952
You asshole!

14:29.953 --> 14:33.656
He had horrible adult
acne two years ago.

14:33.657 --> 14:36.291
People used to joke that
God had trashed his face.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.893
Where are you going?

14:37.894 --> 14:39.828
Look, I know you've been trying

14:39.829 --> 14:41.329
to help me connect
with the pack,

14:41.330 --> 14:43.064
but you've only made it worse.

14:43.065 --> 14:46.267
Everybody hates me,
and there's no way to change it.

14:47.836 --> 14:50.805
Don't underestimate me, Ryan.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.612
- What's going on?
- You won't believe this.

14:57.613 --> 14:58.947
The cops just found
everybody's stolen stuff

14:58.948 --> 15:00.481
in Andy's playhouse.

15:00.482 --> 15:01.582
- What?!
- Yeah.

15:01.583 --> 15:03.685
They received an anonymous tip.

15:03.686 --> 15:05.553
I feel bad about Andy.

15:05.554 --> 15:07.422
He seemed like such a nice kid.

15:07.423 --> 15:09.524
So long, Andy.

15:09.525 --> 15:11.259
Let's see your black magic
save you

15:11.260 --> 15:13.228
from getting gang-stomped
in juvie.

15:15.097 --> 15:18.166
My friend, I feel great shame

15:18.167 --> 15:20.335
for accusing you unjustly.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.704
I will not sleep well tonight.

15:22.705 --> 15:25.273
But tomorrow, during the day,

15:25.274 --> 15:27.275
I'll take a long nap.

15:28.277 --> 15:30.445
Welcome to the community, mate.

15:50.214 --> 15:52.582
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hey, Maggie.

15:52.583 --> 15:54.717
I just left some pumpkin
cookies at your house.

15:54.718 --> 15:56.352
You did?

15:56.353 --> 15:58.054
I'm really sorry about
that anus comment.

15:58.055 --> 15:59.522
Dinner at our house next week?

15:59.523 --> 16:01.190
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

16:01.191 --> 16:02.891
Okay. Sure.

16:02.892 --> 16:04.727
Okay. Bye.

16:08.131 --> 16:09.798
Okay. Fine.

16:09.799 --> 16:12.434
It's nice to finally be
a part of the community.

16:12.435 --> 16:14.069
But-but how can I enjoy it

16:14.070 --> 16:16.639
when it's all at the
expense of an innocent kid?

16:16.640 --> 16:18.340
He's not a kid, Ryan.

16:18.341 --> 16:20.042
It just takes the form of a kid.

16:20.043 --> 16:23.078
You know, you talk a lot
about the pack,

16:23.079 --> 16:25.247
but isn't Andy a member
of the pack?

16:25.248 --> 16:27.182
I thought community

16:27.183 --> 16:29.118
was about looking out
for each other.

16:29.119 --> 16:30.485
The pack protects its own?

16:31.921 --> 16:33.622
You're right.

16:33.623 --> 16:35.423
You know what you should do?

16:35.424 --> 16:37.226
March on over
to Mrs. Stevenson's house

16:37.227 --> 16:38.994
and tell her the truth.

16:38.995 --> 16:41.430
Your neighbor's dog
masterminded multiple break-ins

16:41.431 --> 16:43.499
and planted evidence
on her child.

16:45.536 --> 16:48.037
I'll take the blame.

16:48.038 --> 16:50.173
Don't be stupid!
You'll go to jail!

16:50.174 --> 16:51.641
I understand why
you're so angry,

16:51.642 --> 16:53.343
but there's nothing more
I can do.

16:53.344 --> 16:55.412
I can barely afford
Andy's lawyer.

16:55.413 --> 16:58.282
Your son owes me
a new laptop, snowflake!

16:58.283 --> 16:59.984
Mr. Patel, stop.

16:59.985 --> 17:01.720
It isn't her fault.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.721
There's something
you need to know.

17:03.722 --> 17:04.989
I-I was...

17:10.494 --> 17:14.798
I was looking for Wilfred,
and I found him lying here.

17:14.799 --> 17:17.000
He's dead.

17:17.001 --> 17:19.201
- Who is he?
- I've seen him around,

17:19.202 --> 17:20.935
- but I don't know his name.
- Look at this.

17:20.936 --> 17:22.371
Laptop.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.172
- Laptop.
- Wilfred.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.941
That's my laptop!

17:25.942 --> 17:28.777
Hmm... Mr. Patel's
stolen laptop.

17:28.778 --> 17:30.445
- I wonder if that means...
- Oh, my God.

17:30.446 --> 17:32.881
Maybe this homeless guy
was the thief all along.

17:32.882 --> 17:35.150
- I-I don't know if...
- I'll bet that sick bastard

17:35.151 --> 17:37.518
was stashing the stolen goods
in little Andy's playhouse.

17:37.519 --> 17:39.187
Sick!

17:39.188 --> 17:41.255
Couldn't have said it better
myself, Gene.

17:41.256 --> 17:42.757
So, Andy didn't do it. It was...

17:42.758 --> 17:44.258
Well, hold on. I-I think

17:44.259 --> 17:46.627
we're all jumping
to conclusions.

17:46.628 --> 17:47.861
- The truth is...
- Ryan,

17:47.862 --> 17:51.131
what am I gonna do
if you go to jail?

17:51.132 --> 17:53.667
You're the most important
member of my pack.

17:53.668 --> 17:55.769
The pack protects its own.

17:58.405 --> 18:03.342
Uh, I guess...
there's no other explanation.

18:05.078 --> 18:06.646
The bum did it.

18:06.647 --> 18:08.448
Thank God.

18:08.449 --> 18:12.252
Wilfred, please tell me
you didn't kill Trash Face?

18:12.253 --> 18:13.987
'Course not, Ryan.

18:13.988 --> 18:16.156
I just left 20 bucks
in his change cup.

18:16.157 --> 18:18.626
But his cardboard sign
was very clear.

18:18.627 --> 18:20.795
That money was
for food, not drugs.

18:20.796 --> 18:25.032
Besides, he got what he wanted.

18:25.033 --> 18:27.034
To be remembered as a
dead, homeless junkie

18:27.035 --> 18:28.369
who stole their stuff?

18:30.238 --> 18:32.239
Exactly.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.307
To be remembered.

18:37.111 --> 18:40.747
Trash Face, I didn't
know you that well.

18:40.748 --> 18:42.982
You were homeless, and...

18:42.983 --> 18:45.485
I'm just gonna come
out and say it.

18:45.486 --> 18:48.154
You were kind of a prostitute.

18:48.155 --> 18:50.824
But you taught me
a valuable lesson.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.427
It's important to have
other people in your life.

18:53.428 --> 18:55.429
Don't worry, Ryan.

18:55.430 --> 18:58.132
Trash Face is probably
smiling down on us

18:58.133 --> 19:00.435
from heaven right now.

19:00.436 --> 19:02.770
Hell, I bet he just
found a fresh vein

19:02.771 --> 19:04.406
in one of his angel wings.

19:12.582 --> 19:15.450
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

19:15.451 --> 19:17.819
He was part
of my community, Ryan.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.954
I'm paying my respects.

19:19.955 --> 19:22.991
Rest in peace, Trash Face.

19:22.992 --> 19:26.127
Rest in peace.

19:37.444 --> 19:41.030
No, thanks. I think I need
to take a break for a while.

19:41.031 --> 19:43.577
You mean, like,
not getting high?

19:43.578 --> 19:47.097
I just want
to clear my head for real.

19:47.098 --> 19:50.356
Suit yourself. Knock.

19:50.357 --> 19:53.993
By the way, I'm glad
you patched things up with Andy.

19:53.994 --> 19:55.962
That was big of you.

19:55.963 --> 19:59.802
Yeah, well, I guess
he is part of the pack.

19:59.803 --> 20:03.302
And honestly,
Andy's not so bad.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.772
I think I figured
out his trick.

20:04.773 --> 20:05.804
Check it out.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.472
This-this is gonna
blow your mind.

20:11.911 --> 20:15.480
And the ball is still in my...

20:15.481 --> 20:17.490
How the hell does he do that?!

20:17.491 --> 20:20.352
Transcript by Addic7ed.com

20:20.353 --> 20:22.254
Well, I should go shower.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.323
I got to get ready
for Maggie's dinner party.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.758
Do it.
Jesus, Bear,

20:26.759 --> 20:28.827
Ryan doesn't know
we call him that.

20:28.828 --> 20:33.365
Not to his face. Idiot!

20:33.366 --> 20:35.500
Bad.
