When I was a kid,
all my relatives,

Is that what
you want to do, Connor?

16:33.741 --> 16:35.083
that's on him, not me.

16:35.183 --> 16:37.045

is about more than money--

you don't believe in him.

in all my bathrooms.

16:50.238 --> 16:51.379
- Well, he doesn't
see it that way.

16:51.479 --> 16:53.101
He thinks that, because you
refused the money,

16:53.201 --> 16:54.983
it's like you're saying
that he'll never

16:55.083 --> 16:57.085

Can Tom be a big sensitive?
Sure.

I mean, he tears up
at ads for minivans,

17:06.294 --> 17:10.879

being sensitive enough.
