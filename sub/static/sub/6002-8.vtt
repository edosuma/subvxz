WEBVTT

00:00.003 --> 00:02.138
Previously on "Satisfaction"...

00:02.138 --> 00:04.010
Your husband ruined my marriage.

00:04.019 --> 00:05.121
I know how you feel right now.

00:05.154 --> 00:07.923
Oh, really? You know how I feel, huh?

00:07.943 --> 00:09.411
Do you know where your father is?

00:09.444 --> 00:11.079
Who are you? How did you
get into my apartment?

00:11.079 --> 00:12.948
My father's an old friend of yours.

00:12.948 --> 00:15.817
How does someone like him
wind up owing $50 million

00:15.817 --> 00:17.152
to an Omar Sandhal?

00:17.386 --> 00:20.422
If he disappears, you inherit his debt.

00:20.422 --> 00:23.993
Arthur and his wife were killed
in a car accident two days ago.

00:24.826 --> 00:27.095
Have you ever had a psychedelic experience?

00:27.129 --> 00:29.564
Those who travel are lost.

00:29.598 --> 00:32.500
Those who seek know exactly
what they're looking for.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.536
Where's my money? It's not in my backpack.

00:34.536 --> 00:36.838
If we're going to usher
in a whole new level

00:36.872 --> 00:38.106
of consciousness...

00:38.106 --> 00:39.641
I said I would help out,
not give it all away.

00:39.675 --> 00:42.844
My dad gave me some money and I lost it.

00:42.844 --> 00:46.081
$22,345... that's how
much you stole from her.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.849
Anika made a donation.

00:47.849 --> 00:49.851
As for stealing, she took something of mine

00:49.851 --> 00:51.119
before she left.

00:51.153 --> 00:52.521
Which you can have back
when you return the money.

00:52.554 --> 00:53.722
Should I really believe that?

00:55.590 --> 00:56.992
Went to see Julian.

00:57.025 --> 00:58.727
I got your money back.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.562
Are you gonna tell her that's your money?

01:00.595 --> 01:02.864
Thanks for giving my money back.

01:02.898 --> 01:04.465
Where is she?

01:04.498 --> 01:05.434
Mom and Dad,

01:05.434 --> 01:07.836
I fell in love, I found a home,

01:07.836 --> 01:09.571
and I found an new family.

01:15.577 --> 01:17.412
Ever since I can remember,
I've always thought

01:17.446 --> 01:19.614
that there was more to this world

01:19.614 --> 01:21.016
than meets the eye.

01:26.855 --> 01:28.757
That there were other planes,

01:28.757 --> 01:31.760
hidden doorways to get you there,

01:31.760 --> 01:34.596
if you're willing to
face your deepest fears.

01:38.166 --> 01:41.670
Have you ever had a psychedelic experience?

01:45.907 --> 01:48.810
Neil?

01:48.844 --> 01:50.012
Anika!

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.661 --> 02:07.662
Anika?

02:09.431 --> 02:10.999
What's going on? Anika?

02:11.032 --> 02:13.468
What have we done?

02:18.000 --> 02:21.505
_

02:21.510 --> 02:22.711
Careful, careful.

02:22.744 --> 02:24.513
Oh.

02:24.513 --> 02:26.148
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

02:28.517 --> 02:30.686
What do you think?

02:30.719 --> 02:32.423
Uh...

02:34.456 --> 02:36.425
Is this all for making drugs?

02:36.425 --> 02:39.828
No this is for saving peoples' lives.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.968
Look.

02:45.968 --> 02:48.036
Welcome to the future site of

02:48.270 --> 02:51.273
the Dome Addiction Recovery Center.

02:51.306 --> 02:53.909
A revolutionary approach
to overcoming drug addiction

02:53.942 --> 02:55.942
through hallucinogenic experience.

02:58.580 --> 03:00.849
Are you opening a clinic?

03:00.882 --> 03:03.819
It's more like a doorway.

03:03.852 --> 03:07.389
You know that what I make,
it's... it's not a drug.

03:07.422 --> 03:09.458
It's a way into your subconscious.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.293
Real drugs... meth, heroin...

03:11.326 --> 03:14.596
they're about trying to
escape, but psychedelics...

03:14.629 --> 03:17.934
they're about getting back to your center.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.836
It's why shamans have
used them for centuries.

03:20.869 --> 03:24.573
I've been working on a
unique delivery system.

03:24.606 --> 03:27.442
How come you never said
anything about this before?

03:27.476 --> 03:28.980
Well, I had to get the formula right

03:32.014 --> 03:34.014
and find the right partner.

03:37.753 --> 03:40.756
The drugs that you stole.

03:40.756 --> 03:42.958
Where are they?

03:42.991 --> 03:45.027
I was trying to help her.

03:45.027 --> 03:47.863
In what world is hiding our
daughter from us helping her?

03:47.896 --> 03:50.365
She just needed time. She
wasn't ready to see you.

03:50.365 --> 03:51.767
- Why the hell not?
- I don't know, Grace!

03:51.767 --> 03:54.403
Maybe she wasn't feeling
up to facing your judgment.

03:54.436 --> 03:56.739
Why would we be judging her?

03:59.341 --> 04:01.943
There was situation with a boy.

04:01.977 --> 04:03.011
His name is Julian.

04:03.011 --> 04:05.380
The little punk took all her money.

04:05.414 --> 04:06.915
Oh, my God. Is she okay?

04:06.915 --> 04:09.518
She's fine and I managed to get it back,

04:09.551 --> 04:11.053
but I think there's more to the story.

04:11.286 --> 04:12.888
There were drugs involved.

04:12.921 --> 04:13.989
What kind of drugs?

04:14.022 --> 04:15.057
Where is this guy?

04:15.290 --> 04:16.358
Could she have gone back to him?

04:16.391 --> 04:17.591
Rosalie?

04:17.625 --> 04:20.062
Will you get the Trumans
directions to that camp, please?

04:20.295 --> 04:22.965
He's part of some
ridiculous tribe of hippies

04:23.665 --> 04:25.500
living out in the woods.

04:25.534 --> 04:29.037
Grace, she was confused and needed help.

04:29.037 --> 04:30.839
You would have done the same thing.

04:30.872 --> 04:32.507
Bullshit.

04:32.507 --> 04:34.910
This is about power. It's
always about power with you

04:34.943 --> 04:36.845
and this is you using
our daughter as a pawn

04:36.878 --> 04:38.713
to hold something over us.

04:38.747 --> 04:40.649
You know what? Fine.

04:40.649 --> 04:41.650
Make up whatever story you want.

04:41.683 --> 04:45.353
Innocent girl held captive by witch.

04:45.387 --> 04:46.621
It's not what happened.

04:46.655 --> 04:49.424
I don't believe a word you say anymore.

04:49.424 --> 04:51.560
Is it really that shocking
that Anika wouldn't want

04:51.560 --> 04:54.597
to return to your little
house full of secrets?

04:59.301 --> 05:01.803
What have you told her about
us these last couple of days?

05:01.803 --> 05:03.405
Oh, you mean how daddy was an escort

05:03.438 --> 05:05.807
and mommy paid someone to service her?

05:08.543 --> 05:10.545
Didn't come up.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.953
Address for the camp.

05:17.953 --> 05:19.988
Let's go.

05:21.690 --> 05:23.291
It's so sad to me.

05:23.325 --> 05:25.694
You can't have your own
marriage or your own family,

05:25.727 --> 05:27.798
so you just keep on trying to steal mine.

05:29.831 --> 05:31.600
What's sad to me is how your life

05:31.633 --> 05:35.036
keeps showing up at my door.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.973
Why do you think that is, Grace?

05:37.973 --> 05:40.542
Grace, come on.

06:12.441 --> 06:14.650
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:18.013 --> 06:20.450
I'm gonna need you to sign
them over to the funeral home.

06:22.354 --> 06:25.323
Here they are.

06:30.295 --> 06:32.931
How do you know who's who?

06:33.198 --> 06:35.934
It's right there.

07:11.403 --> 07:12.737
Hey!

07:12.771 --> 07:14.306
Hey, what are you doing?

07:14.372 --> 07:16.541
Hey, you can't open this
here, man... I could...

07:25.650 --> 07:27.719
Shit.

07:30.856 --> 07:33.291
It was a mountain road.

07:33.325 --> 07:36.561
The car went over an
embankment and caught fire.

07:36.595 --> 07:39.898
I called up the embassy.
They gave me the details.

07:43.401 --> 07:46.771
God, I haven't smelled that
stench in so many years.

07:46.805 --> 07:49.908
But you never forget.

07:50.142 --> 07:51.576
I'm very sorry.

07:51.643 --> 07:53.545
What the hell are you doing here?

07:53.578 --> 07:54.646
Your father was still a friend.

07:54.679 --> 07:58.316
Bullshit. What do you want?

07:58.383 --> 08:01.486
You know what I want.

08:03.688 --> 08:06.324
To pay my respects.

08:06.391 --> 08:08.160
That's very kind of you.

08:08.193 --> 08:09.528
Why don't we go outside
and I'll show you how much

08:09.561 --> 08:11.930
I appreciate it?

08:13.532 --> 08:16.168
I know this is an emotional time for you.

08:16.201 --> 08:17.869
I understand that.

08:17.903 --> 08:21.003
But don't let those
emotions cloud your judgment.

08:22.741 --> 08:23.808
You wouldn't want to make the same mistakes

08:23.842 --> 08:26.244
your father did.

08:26.311 --> 08:29.247
If you had anything to do with this...

08:31.449 --> 08:34.653
I'll give you 48 hours to
show me a good faith gesture

08:35.187 --> 08:38.722
that lets me know I'll be paid.

09:07.586 --> 09:10.555
Certainly looks like the place.

09:20.232 --> 09:21.533
Oh, excuse me, I'm, uh...

09:21.600 --> 09:24.636
We're looking for our daughter, Anika.

09:24.669 --> 09:27.572
Oh, my God. He told us you might be coming.

09:27.606 --> 09:29.507
Julian, he has visions sometimes.

09:29.574 --> 09:31.409
How long has Anika been here?

09:31.476 --> 09:33.545
She's been part of our
family for over a month.

09:33.612 --> 09:35.447
Julian went to go find her.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.848
We all miss Anika so much.

09:36.881 --> 09:38.316
We're a tribe. We're all about supporting

09:38.383 --> 09:41.319
each other, living a more spiritual life.

09:41.386 --> 09:43.221
In fact, we're just about to get started.

09:43.255 --> 09:44.222
Would you like to join us?

09:44.256 --> 09:46.591
Oh, no, no, thank you.

09:46.658 --> 09:49.628
Well, you're family now.
So make yourself at home.

10:02.507 --> 10:05.577
What is all this stuff?

10:14.753 --> 10:17.389
It's time for meditation, Dome family.

10:34.472 --> 10:37.509
Neil. Look at this.

10:44.549 --> 10:45.684
She looks stoned.

10:45.717 --> 10:47.652
What is she doing with him?

10:47.686 --> 10:51.090
We'll find her. Everything's gonna be okay.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.729
Well, look who's back.

10:57.796 --> 11:01.499
Don't go changing our music
on us again, little girl.

11:01.566 --> 11:03.835
Yeah, uh, Adriana's not here, is she?

11:03.868 --> 11:05.837
I didn't see her car.

11:05.870 --> 11:07.272
I saw her go out.

11:09.574 --> 11:11.676
Well, I'm just gonna...

11:11.710 --> 11:15.280
I left some stuff in
my room from before, so.

11:35.495 --> 11:39.240
_

12:47.739 --> 12:49.541
Well, why can't we call the police?

12:49.607 --> 12:51.342
Huh? What if it's a cult?

12:51.376 --> 12:53.178
Well, we don't know the whole story yet.

12:53.244 --> 12:55.480
If there's drugs involved,
then Anika could get arrested

12:55.513 --> 12:58.483
if she's...

12:58.516 --> 13:00.885
What's he doing here?

13:03.221 --> 13:06.591
Hey. Uh...

13:06.658 --> 13:07.725
What are you doing?

13:07.792 --> 13:08.827
I need your help.

13:08.860 --> 13:11.529
Look, um, now's not a good time.

13:11.563 --> 13:14.463
I don't know if it's safe
for me to go home right now.

13:16.701 --> 13:18.670
Um...

13:18.703 --> 13:21.739
My father was killed in Argentina.

13:21.806 --> 13:24.642
And Emma too.

13:24.676 --> 13:27.579
Oh, my God.

13:27.645 --> 13:31.182
Oh, my God, what happened?

13:31.249 --> 13:33.518
A car accident.

13:35.620 --> 13:38.457
Ah, Simon, I'm sorry.

13:39.524 --> 13:41.926
Um, what can I do?

13:42.160 --> 13:44.796
It's my inheritance. Okay, um...

13:44.829 --> 13:47.198
I need to liquidate some cash.

13:47.265 --> 13:50.602
A lot of cash, fast.

13:50.635 --> 13:53.505
It's complicated, okay? He
died owing a lot of money.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.440
Well, look, if it's business,
then maybe his lawyers can help.

13:55.473 --> 13:57.542
I don't trust those assholes, okay?

13:57.575 --> 13:58.877
They're probably in on it.

13:59.143 --> 14:00.912
In on what?

14:03.248 --> 14:05.585
Um... is there a way expedite the will

14:07.619 --> 14:09.220
or at least part of his holdings?

14:09.287 --> 14:10.522
Simon, what's going on?

14:10.588 --> 14:12.423
I found the address from the brochure.

14:12.457 --> 14:13.725
It's not that far away.

14:13.758 --> 14:15.727
Sorry, I needed his help with something.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.161
Yeah, we should go.

14:17.195 --> 14:18.263
Um...

14:18.329 --> 14:19.430
Is everything okay?

14:19.464 --> 14:20.932
I'll make a few calls, see what we can do.

14:21.199 --> 14:22.500
Maybe come by the office later.

14:22.567 --> 14:23.501
Mm.

14:23.568 --> 14:24.536
All right.

14:24.602 --> 14:27.171
And, hey...

14:27.205 --> 14:28.740
I'm sorry.

14:28.806 --> 14:30.909
Thanks.

14:40.652 --> 14:42.220
Hi.

14:42.253 --> 14:45.290
So, she does have them.
They're in her safe.

14:45.356 --> 14:47.358
I couldn't get them, but here.

14:53.498 --> 14:55.667
That felt really weird, and I don't want

14:55.733 --> 14:58.703
to do something like that again.

15:00.872 --> 15:03.474
Thank you for this.

15:04.876 --> 15:08.379
I can take it from here.

15:13.257 --> 15:15.393
This is definitely his place.

15:15.393 --> 15:17.495
Is it locked? Can you get the door open?

15:23.401 --> 15:25.670
What is... what is all this?

15:25.670 --> 15:27.472
What does it look like?

15:27.505 --> 15:29.540
You read the brochure.

15:29.540 --> 15:32.778
I just don't understand
why is she involved in this?

15:39.383 --> 15:41.452
Aah!

15:43.020 --> 15:44.288
Aah!

15:47.758 --> 15:49.193
Neil, that isn't helping!

15:49.227 --> 15:50.096
Aah!

15:52.129 --> 15:54.499
Oh, yeah? Well, it felt really good to me!

15:54.532 --> 15:56.767
Jesus, Anika. Why?

16:00.338 --> 16:03.374
We basically pushed her out of the house.

16:03.407 --> 16:04.675
And you're the one who gave her that huge

16:04.675 --> 16:07.446
wad of cash and said go see the world.

16:08.279 --> 16:10.147
Oh, so this is my fault now?

16:10.147 --> 16:12.116
It's not a choice I would have made.

16:12.149 --> 16:13.251
But you supported it.

16:13.284 --> 16:14.685
I wasn't consulted.

16:14.685 --> 16:17.021
No, 'cause you were busy,
Grace, with you new best friend

16:17.054 --> 16:19.423
and lover, Adriana.

16:19.457 --> 16:21.425
Okay, so it's okay for
you to go off the deep end

16:21.459 --> 16:23.561
into those waters, but not for me?

16:23.561 --> 16:25.263
No, what I'm saying is,
you can't just make this

16:25.296 --> 16:27.298
all my fault.

16:27.331 --> 16:30.101
We raised her together for 17 years.

16:30.134 --> 16:31.702
- Yeah.
- We're both to blame.

16:31.702 --> 16:34.672
Right, that's right.
We're shitty parents, Neil.

16:34.705 --> 16:36.474
Our marriage fell apart
and our kid freaked out

16:36.507 --> 16:39.010
and... what's left?

16:39.043 --> 16:42.513
Hey, hey.

16:42.547 --> 16:44.515
I'm sorry.

16:46.484 --> 16:49.186
I just thought that we
were getting back on track.

16:49.220 --> 16:50.421
All of us.

16:50.454 --> 16:52.390
We are.

16:52.423 --> 16:56.294
And you know what? We will make this right.

16:56.327 --> 16:58.296
Just not fighting each other.

17:01.065 --> 17:03.568
Oh.

17:03.601 --> 17:04.704
Hello?

17:06.737 --> 17:08.705
Who?

17:12.710 --> 17:15.413
Uh, thank you for calling.

17:16.213 --> 17:19.349
I just thought you should know.

17:19.349 --> 17:22.686
Where is she?

17:22.720 --> 17:25.222
She's not ready to see visitors right now.

17:25.222 --> 17:27.290
Rosalie, I came right over.

17:37.401 --> 17:39.236
Oh, God.

17:39.270 --> 17:40.738
What are you doing here now?

17:40.771 --> 17:43.207
Rosalie!

17:43.207 --> 17:44.709
I'm not here to fight.

17:44.742 --> 17:47.311
Well, I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

17:49.113 --> 17:52.316
Then I can wait downstairs.

17:52.350 --> 17:54.318
Wait!

17:57.655 --> 18:00.225
Give us a minute, would you darlings?

18:00.658 --> 18:03.261
Suppose I've had enough
stress relief for one day.

18:03.661 --> 18:04.795
Mm.

18:14.405 --> 18:16.474
You paid Anika back with your own money

18:16.507 --> 18:18.643
and told her it was Julian's?

18:18.676 --> 18:20.645
What are you talking about?

18:20.645 --> 18:21.681
Rosalie told me.

18:27.785 --> 18:29.654
You weren't supposed to know.

18:29.687 --> 18:31.255
Why would you do that?

18:31.255 --> 18:32.757
'Cause she's a kid and
she made a dumb mistake.

18:32.790 --> 18:34.258
She shouldn't have to pay for it.

18:34.291 --> 18:36.162
And it wasn't that much.

18:38.162 --> 18:39.296
Don't do that.

18:39.330 --> 18:41.666
You want to pay me back, fine.

18:41.699 --> 18:45.103
No, I meant make it seem like
it wasn't a big deal for you.

18:47.438 --> 18:49.007
Maybe I misjudged you.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.478
Maybe you really were trying to help.

18:54.512 --> 18:57.549
And as a mom, I appreciate that.

18:58.282 --> 18:59.550
Would you like me to call anyone?

18:59.550 --> 19:01.285
No, there's nothing the police can do.

19:01.285 --> 19:03.487
We're... we're gonna go back to that lab

19:03.521 --> 19:05.289
in a few hours and...

19:05.322 --> 19:08.159
Grace.

19:08.192 --> 19:10.428
You raised a good kid.

19:10.428 --> 19:12.428
She's a little lost right now, but...

19:15.166 --> 19:18.203
she's lucky to have you as parents.

19:18.703 --> 19:22.173
I would have killed for
that kind of love growing up.

19:28.446 --> 19:30.314
Enough of this sappy shit.

19:30.314 --> 19:32.383
I'm going to get dressed
and have some lunch.

19:32.416 --> 19:34.418
You're welcome to join me.

19:39.590 --> 19:41.525
Sorry, I'm late.

19:41.559 --> 19:43.127
Had to make a stop.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.463
Are you gardening?

19:45.463 --> 19:48.199
Uh, yeah I was, actually.

19:48.232 --> 19:50.601
My mother had me promise
to plant lilies on her grave

19:50.634 --> 19:53.337
when my father died...

19:53.370 --> 19:55.206
to celebrate.

19:55.206 --> 19:56.707
Sounds like my parents.

19:56.741 --> 19:58.542
Yeah, I think her greatest regret

19:58.576 --> 20:00.377
was that she wasn't gonna be alive

20:00.411 --> 20:02.614
to see his ass die.

20:03.447 --> 20:05.750
How are you holding up?

20:05.750 --> 20:07.718
Oh... what about you?

20:07.752 --> 20:09.420
Everything okay with your daughter?

20:11.589 --> 20:12.757
Where is everyone?

20:12.757 --> 20:16.060
Meditation day. Shit, I forgot to call.

20:16.093 --> 20:18.496
I'm sorry, Frank. I have to cancel

20:18.496 --> 20:19.764
indefinitely.

20:19.797 --> 20:21.632
What's going on?

20:21.665 --> 20:24.368
Feels like there's been
a death around here.

20:24.368 --> 20:27.037
That's not entirely wrong.

20:27.071 --> 20:28.172
Well, I'm here.

20:28.205 --> 20:30.074
You can take advantage if you like.

20:30.074 --> 20:32.076
Uh, no, you know. We're a bit busy.

20:32.109 --> 20:35.346
No, maybe it's not a bad idea.

20:35.346 --> 20:37.515
What happened in here?

20:39.083 --> 20:42.553
This had to be your parents.

20:42.586 --> 20:44.722
You don't know that.

20:44.755 --> 20:47.124
They went to the campsite.

20:47.124 --> 20:49.627
They've been looking for us!

20:49.660 --> 20:52.129
Look around, Anika.

20:52.129 --> 20:53.364
Nothing is missing.

20:53.397 --> 20:54.732
This...

20:58.536 --> 21:02.273
This was done purely out of anger.

21:06.477 --> 21:10.048
It's their lower form of consciousness.

21:10.781 --> 21:12.049
They're just worried about me.

21:12.082 --> 21:15.085
You can't judge them for that.

21:16.387 --> 21:19.256
It's not your fault that
you love your parents.

21:19.256 --> 21:21.525
My fault?

21:21.525 --> 21:25.296
They've shown you who they really are.

21:25.329 --> 21:28.499
You have to let them go.

21:28.532 --> 21:31.669
Before they destroy you, too.

21:34.538 --> 21:36.173
Why don't I just call them?

21:36.173 --> 21:37.775
You do that and you're
following their path,

21:38.008 --> 21:40.110
not yours.

21:46.016 --> 21:49.316
There's been enough damage done already.

21:50.688 --> 21:54.191
Let me take care of this now.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.528
Are you sure you don't
need something to eat?

21:57.561 --> 21:59.530
Rosalie made some spectacular empanadas.

21:59.563 --> 22:02.666
No, I have to meet Neil back at the house.

22:02.700 --> 22:06.537
And, uh, we'll send over a
check for what you gave her.

22:06.570 --> 22:09.073
Grace, it's the nicest thing
I've done for anyone in a while.

22:09.073 --> 22:12.142
Don't take that away from me.

22:12.176 --> 22:13.410
If you hear from her...

22:13.444 --> 22:17.181
I'll let you know right away.

22:17.181 --> 22:19.450
Julian.

22:19.450 --> 22:21.018
That is you.

22:21.051 --> 22:22.653
Do you mind if I come in?

22:22.686 --> 22:24.788
We have a lot to talk about.

22:32.596 --> 22:35.032
Where is he?

22:37.067 --> 22:39.403
Mr. Truman. I feel like we've already met.

22:39.436 --> 22:41.338
Oh, no. You would've remembered me.

22:41.338 --> 22:42.473
Is Anika here?

22:42.473 --> 22:45.042
No, he has a proposal for us.

22:45.075 --> 22:46.243
A what?

22:46.277 --> 22:48.312
Just so that we could
avoid calling the police,

22:48.345 --> 22:50.714
making things messier.

22:50.748 --> 22:52.216
Well, you trashed my
lab. That's trespassing

22:52.216 --> 22:54.218
and destruction of property.

22:54.218 --> 22:56.620
She assaulted me in my home.

22:56.620 --> 22:59.223
Which is a felony.

22:59.256 --> 23:00.457
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

23:00.491 --> 23:02.326
I'm a spiritual man.

23:03.460 --> 23:04.461
So I believe there's a solution here

23:04.495 --> 23:05.496
where we can all get what we want.

23:05.496 --> 23:07.197
True.

23:08.232 --> 23:09.366
You're keeping Anika somewhere?

23:09.400 --> 23:12.236
She decided to stay away all on her own.

23:12.269 --> 23:15.773
Because she was afraid
of just what you're doing,

23:15.806 --> 23:17.041
which is assault.

23:18.175 --> 23:19.743
I've done nothing wrong.

23:19.777 --> 23:21.278
Neil.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.747
This can all be resolved very quickly.

23:23.747 --> 23:26.483
No one has to get hurt.

23:29.787 --> 23:32.887
I simply need five minutes of your time.

23:34.258 --> 23:37.294
Shall we talk outside?

23:41.532 --> 23:44.732
Since we're all a little tense,

23:46.170 --> 23:49.239
this should help soothe the mood.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.777
You better get on with it, son.

23:56.113 --> 23:57.114
Please, don't.

23:57.114 --> 23:58.515
Stop it.

24:01.251 --> 24:03.120
The material that you took from Anika

24:03.153 --> 24:05.356
was the result of months of hard work

24:05.389 --> 24:07.791
and great financial expense.

24:07.791 --> 24:09.760
And by material, you mean this drug

24:09.793 --> 24:11.428
you've been manufacturing.

24:11.462 --> 24:13.697
Well, it's not recognized as a narcotic

24:13.697 --> 24:15.432
by the FDA. It's perfectly legal.

24:15.432 --> 24:16.700
Or a loophole

24:16.700 --> 24:18.302
since you made some designer tweaks to it.

24:18.302 --> 24:19.570
The point is, it belonged to me

24:19.603 --> 24:22.173
and it was stolen.

24:22.806 --> 24:25.142
You have it and I want it back.

24:25.142 --> 24:27.544
Anika, what happened to you?

24:27.578 --> 24:29.546
Mom, Dad, I'm fine.

24:29.580 --> 24:32.549
Uh, did you work everything out?

24:32.583 --> 24:35.419
Darling, you were supposed
to wait for my call.

24:39.690 --> 24:42.593
You know, why don't you
all reconnect for a moment.

24:43.327 --> 24:45.362
Nature seems to be calling me.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.164
I saw a bathroom when I walked in.

24:47.164 --> 24:49.266
Then you don't need me to show you.

24:49.299 --> 24:50.534
Right.

24:55.606 --> 24:57.708
Anika, we were so worried about you.

24:57.741 --> 24:59.710
Why weren't you returning our calls?

24:59.710 --> 25:01.011
I'm sorry,

25:01.045 --> 25:02.279
but I knew that you guys would freak out.

25:02.312 --> 25:03.580
I'm fine.

25:03.614 --> 25:04.715
Do you know how much trouble you'd be in

25:04.715 --> 25:06.784
if the police got involved? Drugs?

25:07.017 --> 25:09.019
It's really not what you think.

25:09.053 --> 25:11.288
What are we missing, then?

25:26.737 --> 25:29.339
I know what you think, but
Julian is not a bad person.

25:29.373 --> 25:30.574
He's just trying to help me.

25:30.644 --> 25:32.746
He's actually trying
to help a lot of people.

25:32.779 --> 25:34.781
I don't understand how
your life took this turn.

25:34.781 --> 25:37.351
A month ago, you were thinking
about going to college.

25:37.384 --> 25:39.620
Ugh, Mom, I was thinking
about a lot of stuff.

25:39.653 --> 25:41.688
Anika, Julian's a criminal.

25:45.826 --> 25:49.563
I knew none of you would understand.

25:49.563 --> 25:51.431
You can't see him again, and
you're coming home with us.

25:51.465 --> 25:52.699
Coming home with who?

25:52.699 --> 25:53.800
You guys aren't even a couple anymore.

25:53.834 --> 25:55.269
- Anika.
- And if you think

25:55.302 --> 25:56.537
that you can take out
your problems on me now...

25:56.570 --> 25:58.505
Did you guys know he's leaving?

25:58.539 --> 25:59.840
What?

25:59.840 --> 26:02.309
Julian, he just got in his
car and he's driving off.

26:40.180 --> 26:42.716
There's um... there's
veggie lasagna in the fridge.

26:42.716 --> 26:45.552
I could warm some up.

27:27.527 --> 27:28.695
Anika.

27:28.729 --> 27:30.464
Did you get them?

27:30.497 --> 27:33.100
Yes. Thank you.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.702
Then we're done.

27:35.736 --> 27:36.770
Anika...

27:36.803 --> 27:38.472
No, Julian. I'm not coming back.

27:38.505 --> 27:41.141
And I'm not asking you to.

27:41.141 --> 27:42.809
I just want to wish you
and your parents good luck

27:42.843 --> 27:46.246
on your journeys, and when it's all over,

27:46.280 --> 27:50.250
I hope you find what you're looking for.

27:50.284 --> 27:51.251
What are you talking about?

27:51.285 --> 27:52.519
When what is over?

27:52.519 --> 27:53.787
As I said, the world is filled

27:53.787 --> 27:56.757
with those who seek and those who travel.

27:56.790 --> 27:58.794
Your parents, Adriana, they're traveling

28:00.827 --> 28:03.530
and they're lost,

28:03.563 --> 28:06.400
so I left them a map.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.335
A map?

28:08.368 --> 28:10.504
Julian, what are you talking about?

28:10.537 --> 28:13.674
That new delivery system
I've been working on.

28:13.674 --> 28:16.810
It was in the incense.

28:16.810 --> 28:19.513
I'm sure it smelled familiar.

28:52.622 --> 28:55.658
You can't save them.

29:09.339 --> 29:11.708
Wait.

29:11.741 --> 29:12.742
Wait, where are you going?

30:01.291 --> 30:02.592
You have a visitor.

30:05.528 --> 30:07.464
Who is it?

30:07.497 --> 30:10.500
Come see for yourself.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.402
Anika, you're going to be late for school.

30:46.436 --> 30:47.837
I have to make some stops along the way.

30:47.837 --> 30:49.372
Let's go!

30:49.405 --> 30:52.542
Mom, why are you even here?

31:17.166 --> 31:18.535
Anika?

31:29.212 --> 31:31.581
Anika! Your lunch!

31:52.468 --> 31:54.905
Every day, doesn't matter what I do.

31:57.373 --> 32:00.376
Has anyone seen Neil?

32:03.212 --> 32:05.782
Hello?

32:09.886 --> 32:12.990
Now you know why I left and went to Italy.

32:16.392 --> 32:19.592
Look at how beautiful this
place is and that house.

32:21.631 --> 32:24.731
You can smell the vineyards
and the olive trees.

32:28.638 --> 32:30.673
Grace?

32:30.673 --> 32:32.542
You never went.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.811
Neil knows I did.

32:34.811 --> 32:37.914
He'll tell you.

32:38.147 --> 32:39.882
Grace, come home.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.118
Neil?

32:42.151 --> 32:44.187
Grace?

32:46.389 --> 32:48.791
Neil?

33:01.270 --> 33:02.405
You think I ruined your marriage,

33:02.438 --> 33:04.874
well, I may have been a part of saving it.

33:04.907 --> 33:06.676
I know from experience
Grace wouldn't have been

33:06.676 --> 33:08.645
looking for someone like
me if you were giving her

33:08.678 --> 33:11.180
what she needed.

33:11.180 --> 33:12.315
Your marriage was in trouble

33:12.315 --> 33:13.716
long before I came into the picture.

33:13.716 --> 33:15.418
Grace came to me to fix it.

33:17.820 --> 33:19.422
So if you want to blame anyone,

33:19.455 --> 33:22.525
start by blaming yourself.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.906
Hello?

33:39.342 --> 33:41.644
Rosalie?

33:49.686 --> 33:52.155
Honestly.

35:12.201 --> 35:15.638
Don't you run away from me
like that again, young lady.

35:15.671 --> 35:18.641
Do you hear me?

35:33.122 --> 35:36.159
You did the right thing, Neil.

35:39.395 --> 35:42.431
It's so hard to know sometimes.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.576
Neil?

36:26.576 --> 36:28.744
Neil?

36:32.582 --> 36:33.850
What's happening? I...

36:33.883 --> 36:36.552
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

36:36.552 --> 36:38.554
Mom, Dad.

36:38.554 --> 36:40.122
It's gonna be okay.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.558
It's all gonna be okay. I promise.

37:06.616 --> 37:07.750
Are you okay?

37:07.750 --> 37:09.852
Mm. Yeah.

37:13.823 --> 37:14.790
You okay?

37:14.824 --> 37:16.792
Mm.

37:31.474 --> 37:34.510
It helps to hydrate after.

37:34.510 --> 37:36.812
Honey, how many times have you done that?

37:38.915 --> 37:41.884
It was, um... it was surreal.

37:42.118 --> 37:45.821
Yeah, it's, uh... powerful stuff.

37:45.855 --> 37:47.823
But I'm never doing it again.

37:47.857 --> 37:49.592
Any drugs again.

37:49.625 --> 37:51.227
Anika.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.361
You're mom and I are so sorry

37:52.395 --> 37:54.497
for everything that's happened.

37:54.497 --> 37:55.765
For being so neglectful.

37:55.765 --> 37:57.633
You guys had your own stuff going on.

37:57.633 --> 37:58.868
I get it.

37:58.901 --> 38:00.870
No. You don't.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.338
We're your parents.

38:02.371 --> 38:04.674
We should have been there for you.

38:04.707 --> 38:08.011
But, we're gonna be there for you now.

38:08.811 --> 38:11.414
And we're gonna have to talk
about... about everything

38:11.414 --> 38:13.416
that's happened.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.656
Does this mean you guys
are getting back together?

38:20.690 --> 38:23.359
Yes. Yes, honey.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.663
Uh, I have some news too.

38:33.269 --> 38:35.504
It's an acceptance letter to Rand.

38:35.538 --> 38:38.641
Well, it's the printout
of the e-mail they send,

38:38.674 --> 38:41.974
but it came a couple weeks ago
and it's a music scholarship.

38:43.412 --> 38:45.281
There's a Freshman orientation next week

38:45.314 --> 38:48.150
and I don't know, I thought
maybe since I'm home,

38:48.184 --> 38:51.487
I could check it out.

38:54.590 --> 38:56.692
Of course, all of our urns are crafted

38:56.692 --> 38:58.694
of the finest quality materials.

38:58.694 --> 39:01.430
It's simply a matter of personal choice.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.833
Another option would be
to have both their ashes

39:03.866 --> 39:05.368
interred together.

39:05.401 --> 39:08.237
Together?

39:08.270 --> 39:11.674
It's a common request for married couples.

39:12.808 --> 39:14.143
What do you...

39:14.176 --> 39:15.177
You just pour 'em in the same urn?

39:15.211 --> 39:18.180
You mix around like it's Kool-Aid?

39:20.449 --> 39:21.851
Uh, is that something you feel

39:21.851 --> 39:24.820
your mother and father would have liked?

39:24.820 --> 39:27.356
She was not my mother.

39:29.592 --> 39:31.827
She was my father's wife.

39:35.598 --> 39:38.367
She was... she was my...

39:46.842 --> 39:49.879
In any case, it's... it's your decision.

39:49.879 --> 39:51.580
I understand if it's a difficult time,

39:51.614 --> 39:53.416
but given the condition of the deceased,

39:53.449 --> 39:55.418
we do need to...

40:10.633 --> 40:14.370
I hung up on you because I'm done talking.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.607
Simon, it's Dad.

40:18.641 --> 40:20.176
Hello?

40:22.511 --> 40:24.747
Who is this?

40:24.780 --> 40:26.916
It's me.

40:26.916 --> 40:28.350
No.

40:30.352 --> 40:31.454
No.

40:31.487 --> 40:33.756
Yes, it is.

40:33.789 --> 40:35.291
You listen to me.

40:35.324 --> 40:36.625
The accident was faked.

40:36.659 --> 40:37.893
I needed to make it look like I was gone,

40:37.893 --> 40:40.196
but I am still alive.

40:40.229 --> 40:41.897
Now, I need to see you.

40:42.131 --> 40:43.899
I can explain it all to you then.
