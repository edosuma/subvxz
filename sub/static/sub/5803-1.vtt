05:05.931 --> 05:08.605
- Are you going to say hi?
- Maybe tomorrow after my final.

05:08.683 --> 05:12.313
Right now I've got to become an expert
on marginal productivity theory.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.993
I'd ask you what that is,
but then I'm afraid you'd tell me.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.952
You need anything?

05:23.031 --> 05:26.331
I got ups, downs, sideways.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.207
That's very supportive.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.414
What's a few meds between sisters? Huh?

05:33.083 --> 05:34.426
You were in the park today, weren't you?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.513
You promised you wouldn't.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.636
- You know what? I'm sorry. I just...

05:40.715 --> 05:42.262
I try.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.348
Every day

05:44.803 --> 05:47.556
How would you feel if I came home drunk?

05:48.640 --> 05:49.812
I'd hate it.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.019
That's right. You'd lose your shit.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.400
So don't tell me not to be mad.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.419
I got it!

06:14.249 --> 06:16.343
Hey. Billy's cousin gets in tomorrow

06:16.418 --> 06:17.544
and we need to know
about dinner Sunday night.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.753
Oh, right.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.298
Hold on.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.802
Instead of waiting to get better
before you meet a guy,

06:24.885 --> 06:28.731
why don't you meet a guy
and see if that helps you get better?

06:29.764 --> 06:32.233
Please. It's one stupid dinner,
and he's really cute.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.562
I promise. And he's smart.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.772
You'll like him. I know it.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.904
We'll let you know in the morning, okay?

07:04.841 --> 07:07.845
- I got to move your car. It's blocking mine.
- Here. Drive mine.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.104
Thanks. Don't work too hard.

07:59.729 --> 08:00.901
Ah!

08:01.064 --> 08:02.486
There you go, sweetie.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.081
Hey. Hey!

08:10.532 --> 08:12.330
Relax. Relax.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.582
Settle down.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.157
- Okay, I'll do it.
<i>- - Do what?</i>

08:49.070 --> 08:50.947
I'll go to dinner with you guys.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.663
- Yay! Thank you.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.541
<i>- What's the worst that can happen, right?</i>
- You have fun.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.836
Ew!

08:59.456 --> 09:02.676
- Are you going to bed?
- Yeah. I'll finish studying in the morning.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.719
Wake me up when you get home, okay?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.635
- Okay. It'll be 6:30.
- That's perfect.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.594
Ooh, and bring me back something sweet
so we can get fat together after my test.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.228
Okay, it's a deal.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.100
- Hey, my other line. It's Billy.
- All right, sweet dreams.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.480
<i>Love you.</i>

09:21.352 --> 09:24.231
- She said yes to Sunday.
<i>- Oh, that's great.</i>

09:24.814 --> 09:27.488
And the next sound you will hear

09:28.359 --> 09:30.737
is me brushing my teeth.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.746
<i>Pretty please.</i>

09:39.829 --> 09:43.083
No way. If I come over now,
we won't get to bed for hours,

09:43.166 --> 09:44.918
and I still have a ton of reading to do.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.845
<i>Fine. Fine. I'll just
have to hug my pillow.</i>

09:48.213 --> 09:50.011
You leave that poor thing alone.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.468
<i>Or I could drive over there right now.</i>

09:52.550 --> 09:54.268
<i>- In and out, 10 minutes</i>
- Oh.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.312
That's very considerate.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.728
Good night, Billy.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.569
Here's the damage.

10:54.696 --> 10:55.743
Thanks.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.242
Sir, do you want anything else?

11:00.118 --> 11:01.244
Just the check.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.083
- Here you go.
- Great.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.845
Three grilled cheese.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.056
- Hey, did you go to Prospect?
- Yeah, when you were in sixth grade.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.561
Really? You don't look that old.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.813
Dude, give it up.
You got no chance.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.861
Plus, hello? I'm right here.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.815
I know I've seen you before.
Are you famous or something?

11:29.898 --> 11:33.243
Yeah. That's why I work here,
to keep myself humble.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.789
It's your lucky day.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.914
Look what I got on a cup of coffee.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.629
- Look what he gave me for nothing.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.835
But that's not your station.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.593
He usually is.
He's a regular and he's moving away.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.347
See what happens when you're nice
to people? Good things happen.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.251
Okay, I'll see you Monday.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.213
- Hold on. I'm going to walk you to your car.
- I'm right outside.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.767
What, you don't believe me?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.599
Sleep sweet.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.642
Good night.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.801
Rise and shine!

13:55.752 --> 13:57.254
Time to get up.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.612
Molly?

14:25.656 --> 14:28.626
Do you hear that sound?
It's me not laughing.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.790
Come on, Molly!

15:07.990 --> 15:09.742
<i>Hey, it's Molly.
Leave a message.</i>

15:10.993 --> 15:13.496
Hey, it's me. Call me as
soon <i>as</i> you get this.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.173
Immediately, no matter what. Okay, bye.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.744
Hi. I'm too cool
to come to the <i>phone</i> right now.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.579
Billy, it's Jill. I just need you
to call me when you wake up.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.787
Thanks. Bye.

17:16.618 --> 17:17.790
Sergeant Powers.

17:19.829 --> 17:22.959
Jill. Hi. I'm a little busy right now.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.587
- It's urgent.
- Okay.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.430
- Right here?
- Why not?

17:29.632 --> 17:31.134
Uh, he's back.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.471
He came back for me.
He broke into my house,

17:34.554 --> 17:37.433
took my sister because I wasn't there.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.646
That's my sister, Molly. Um...

17:44.313 --> 17:47.362
Well, I moved into the house
about six months ago,

17:47.441 --> 17:49.193
and about a month ago,

17:49.277 --> 17:52.781
Molly called me, saying that it was
too expensive for her to live alone

17:52.863 --> 17:55.787
and asked if she could live in my house.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.085
But I don't think
he ever knew that she lived there.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.006
Miss Conway, what makes you think
your sister's been abducted?

18:02.832 --> 18:05.255
Because I spoke to her last night
on the phone at 11:00.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.506
She was going to bed.

18:06.711 --> 18:10.761
And I don't think that she would
just run off in the middle of the night

18:10.840 --> 18:13.559
without leaving a note.
Especially after what happened to me.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.437
She had a final exam today
that was really important.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.140
She was studying.
She left all her books just laying out,

18:19.223 --> 18:22.523
and she was wearing
a pajama shirt and boxer shorts,

18:23.144 --> 18:27.320
and they weren't at the house when I looked
for them. I know she's still wearing them.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.196
Nobody's writing anything down.

18:32.028 --> 18:35.407
- Anything else?
- I found her earring on the floor.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.867
It's a little diamond post stud

18:38.451 --> 18:41.455
from my parents
that they gave her for her graduation,

18:41.537 --> 18:44.416
and I know she was wearing them
when I left.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.879
He's back. This guy is back.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.635
I know he's back.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.843
Jill, calm down, okay? Please have a seat.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.095
Was there any sign of forced entry?

18:58.179 --> 19:02.275
No. There wasn't any the first time, either.
No one could figure out how he got in.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.647
What about Molly's car?

19:03.726 --> 19:06.479
I drove her car to work,
and I left my car in the driveway.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.486
That's why I think he assumed
that I was home alone.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.908
And Molly's cell phone?

19:11.776 --> 19:12.823
It's...

19:12.902 --> 19:16.327
She keeps it in her purse.
She uses the landline when she's home.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.282
- Where's her purse?
- It's gone.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.664
When you were abducted,
was your purse taken?

19:20.743 --> 19:23.371
- No.
- Is there anything else missing?

19:23.788 --> 19:27.213
No. Yes! An old photo of her

19:27.458 --> 19:29.426
taken from her yearbook.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.181
When you were abducted,
did he take one of your photographs?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.347
No!

19:36.050 --> 19:37.267
No.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.517
Does Molly have a boyfriend?

19:44.016 --> 19:46.485
Yeah. I called him. He's sleeping. He...

19:46.936 --> 19:48.483
Molly could be with him right now.

19:48.562 --> 19:52.192
No, not on the night before a test.
She had a lot of studying to do.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.743
- So, it is possible?
- No.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.454
No. The answer's no.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.875
Jill, there are a million other girls
that this guy could victimize.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.453
Why would he come back for you?

20:03.536 --> 20:06.506
Because I'm the only one that got away,
because I know his secret.

20:06.580 --> 20:10.676
I know what he's doing in Forest Park.
He could have taken any one of these girls.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.503
They're all missing.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.721
If you hear from Molly,
give us a call immediately.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.677
Otherwise, I'll see you back here
on Monday morning.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.138
Monday? It's Friday! It's Friday.

20:23.139 --> 20:27.360
Last week, a college honors student
disappeared into thin air.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.820
Her family said
she must have been kidnapped

20:29.895 --> 20:31.568
because she's a very responsible girl

20:31.647 --> 20:34.526
and would never, ever run off
without telling anyone.

20:35.192 --> 20:39.368
It turns out "thin air" was a motel room
in Walla Walla, Washington.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.167
She met a boy at a party
and decided to be impulsive for once.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.917
Miss Conway,
adults have the right to disappear.

20:49.623 --> 20:53.378
When he came down to kill me,
it was the end of the day.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.594
He said to me, "it's time."
That's what he said to me. "It's time."

20:57.673 --> 20:59.846
He's going to kill Molly tonight. Please.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.849
She's the only family that I have.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.190
- Come on.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.941
- You heard what the lieutenant said.
- No!

21:11.020 --> 21:12.772
Jill, please stop it.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.325
You've been up all night.
It's all in your head.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.778
Please go home and get some sleep.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.049
Jill.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.971
I'm new to this unit,
but I'm going to pull your file right now.

21:37.671 --> 21:40.265
I'm Detective Hood. If you need anything,

21:40.674 --> 21:42.551
please don't hesitate to call.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.352
Here, give me your number.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.858
Punch it in.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.821
She's committed to her story.

21:58.901 --> 21:59.993
Hey!

22:01.195 --> 22:02.412
If my sister dies, it's your fault!

22:04.657 --> 22:06.580
I bet that's Molly right now.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.919
- Hey, is Molly with you?
- No. Why?

22:12.873 --> 22:16.093
I came home last night and she wasn't there
and she didn't leave a note.

22:16.627 --> 22:19.847
Oh, shit.
You don't think she slipped, do you?

22:19.922 --> 22:21.094
Do you think she's drinking?

22:21.298 --> 22:25.098
Uh, no. I'm at the police station,
so I'll call you back.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.972
She's not with her boyfriend.

22:28.055 --> 22:30.979
That's because she might have
two of them. Did you ever think of that?

22:31.058 --> 22:33.811
Look, Jill, why don't you just go home?
Get some sleep?

22:34.103 --> 22:35.650
I'll sleep when he's dead.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.570
She's not going to
go looking for him, is she?

22:42.653 --> 22:44.655
Don't worry. She won't find him.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.866
He doesn't exist.

22:52.121 --> 22:55.216
<i>This time last year,
a few days after Easter,</i>

22:55.291 --> 22:58.090
<i>a hiker spots Jill at the north end
of Forest Park.</i>

22:58.168 --> 23:01.593
She's covered in mud,
about half froze to death,

23:02.381 --> 23:06.102
screaming about how some guy broke
into her house, snatched her out of bed,

23:06.176 --> 23:09.271
threw her down a hole
out in the woods someplace.

23:09.346 --> 23:12.566
Homicide was called in because
she said she wasn't the only one,

23:12.641 --> 23:15.315
that there were human remains down there.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.988
So, of course, we throw everything at it,

23:18.063 --> 23:21.738
search teams, dogs,
aerial units, the whole nine.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.865
And guess what? Nothing.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.198
No hole, no scene at all at the house.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.000
Tests come back on Jill.
No defensive wounds.

23:30.284 --> 23:33.788
No sign of sexual contact,
no foreign DNA of any kind.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.794
And she can't ID the guy at all.

23:36.206 --> 23:39.676
I mean, all day in a hole,
she never once saw the guy's face?

23:42.338 --> 23:44.340
And then she's got this mental history.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.640
A couple of years back,

23:45.716 --> 23:48.060
she lost both of her parents
within a few months of each other.

23:48.135 --> 23:52.015
She ends up in a psych ward
on a suicide watch. Understandably.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.726
We start poking holes in her story,
and she flips out.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.942
We had to ship her off to St. Joseph's
on an involuntary commit.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.694
They held her for a couple of months.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.868
- Oh, man.
- Yeah. But she stuck with her story.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.830
And now every time a girl goes missing,
she thinks it's her guy

24:07.905 --> 24:09.782
and she's in here breaking my balls.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.167
She could always move in with me.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.379
I like them a little crazy.

24:18.207 --> 24:21.381
You want to work with me, Hood?
Get your mind right.

24:21.502 --> 24:24.551
If you want to chase split-tail,
then go be a firefighter. You feel me?

24:25.047 --> 24:26.299
Yes, sir.

24:27.675 --> 24:28.892
All right.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.309
- Hi.
- Any word from Molly yet?

24:37.393 --> 24:40.818
- No. I would have...
- I checked her gym. She hasn't been there.

24:40.896 --> 24:44.571
So now I'm thinking one of her friends from
econ class dragged her off to a study group.

24:44.775 --> 24:48.655
- In her pajama top and boxer shorts?
- Maybe she took a change of clothes.

24:49.279 --> 24:53.079
- But all of her books are here.
- And you're sure this is all of them?

24:54.201 --> 24:55.373
Well, no, but...

24:55.452 --> 24:58.626
If I can find a class list,
I can call some of the other students.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.924
Uh, I would check her desk.

25:01.917 --> 25:02.918
Right.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.844
Man, she's organized.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.021
I told the cops that
she'd never leave without telling me,

25:14.096 --> 25:15.894
but they didn't really care.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.350
Here we go.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.144
- What time's her final?
- Noon.

25:21.270 --> 25:25.616
Okay. Well, if I don't find her,
I'll go to the exam, see if she shows up.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.109
Okay.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.540
And you're positive
she didn't go out drinking, right?

25:33.615 --> 25:35.788
Yeah. Aren't you?

25:42.791 --> 25:44.008
What's that?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.882
You said she was still wearing them.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.844
- Different ones.
- But those are the only pair she has.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.305
No, she has another pair that's off-white
with blue stripes and the same flowers.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.934
- What?
- I've only seen just those.

26:00.017 --> 26:02.361
But I know what she was wearing, Billy.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.587
- They have blue stripes on them, Billy.

26:33.634 --> 26:37.013
Mrs. Cermak, I was wondering
if you could help me with something.

26:37.304 --> 26:40.148
You haven't said one word to me
since the day you moved in,

26:40.224 --> 26:41.350
and now you want my help?

26:41.433 --> 26:44.733
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be unfriendly. I just...

26:45.479 --> 26:47.197
I'm a pretty private person.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.322
What is it, dear? What's the matter?

26:51.401 --> 26:56.202
My sister, Molly, she disappeared while
I was at work last night, and I just...

26:57.366 --> 27:01.416
I was just wondering if you had heard
something. It was after 11:00, maybe.

27:01.495 --> 27:04.999
Oh, good Lord.
I'm sound asleep by 10:00.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.926
So is Herb.
We're dead to the world at that hour.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.002
Okay.

27:09.753 --> 27:12.256
Have you called the police?

27:12.339 --> 27:14.262
Yeah. They don't care.

27:15.509 --> 27:19.605
Well, you know who I would talk to?
I would talk to Conrad Reynolds over there.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.730
He's up all night. He hasn't slept a wink
since his wife died,

27:23.809 --> 27:26.483
and that was 12 years ago now.

27:26.562 --> 27:27.654
Okay.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.323
But be careful. He's real squirrelly.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.242
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.088
What do you want?

27:45.164 --> 27:48.714
Hi, Mr. Reynolds. My name is Jill Conway.
I live across the street and...

27:49.835 --> 27:52.634
Someone stole my bike
from my backyard when I was sleeping,

27:52.713 --> 27:56.638
and I was just wondering if you happened
to see or hear anything unusual last night.

27:56.717 --> 27:59.516
I mind my own business.
You ought to do the same.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.264
Wait.

28:02.431 --> 28:05.810
I mind my own business, too,
but if there's a prowler around

28:06.518 --> 28:09.863
and if he's brazen enough
just to steal my bike off my back porch,

28:09.938 --> 28:11.315
I mean, what's next?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.443
Think hard. Please, Conrad.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.613
Did you see a stranger walking by

28:18.322 --> 28:20.290
or a car that you didn't recognize?

28:23.702 --> 28:24.919
Nothing?

28:26.622 --> 28:28.795
All right. Thanks anyway, though.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.418
There was a noise.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.925
Some asshole honked his horn twice,
real loud.

28:34.004 --> 28:36.928
- In the middle of the night?
- It was after around 1:00.

28:37.007 --> 28:39.226
I know because I was watching my Scrubs.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.974
Did they just drive by?

28:41.053 --> 28:44.057
No, they were parked in front
of that yellow house there.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.233
That's my house. Were they in my driveway?

28:46.308 --> 28:49.983
Yeah. Sat there for a little while
and drove off.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.823
- Did you see the driver?
- Too dark.

28:53.148 --> 28:57.574
But the van was blue and gray.
A locksmith or plumber, I think.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.530
It said "all hours" on the sign.

29:00.322 --> 29:04.202
I don't know why the hell a plumber
would want to steal a bike.

29:05.285 --> 29:08.004
Yeah, neither do I. Thanks a lot.

29:08.372 --> 29:12.843
If you talk to him, you tell him I didn't
appreciate that honking one goddamn bit.

29:12.918 --> 29:15.012
I'm all alone here since my wife died.

29:15.837 --> 29:19.637
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
It must be really hard to sleep alone.

29:20.842 --> 29:21.968
Impossible.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.513
Thanks.

31:04.654 --> 31:07.453
- Do I know you? You almost got us killed.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.168
- Sorry.
- What the hell are you chasing me for?

31:10.827 --> 31:14.081
I wasn't. I was coming here.
I just got stuck in the wrong lane.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.634
Come on. The boss is inside.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.432
Customer!

31:25.759 --> 31:27.056
Back already?

31:27.135 --> 31:30.139
Grabbed the wrong Kwikset.
She wanted the 665.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.567
Henry Massey. What can I do for you?

31:33.642 --> 31:35.736
I need some information, actually.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.487
All right.

31:37.979 --> 31:42.234
Did you have a job last night on Hardy,
off Parkway, at around 2:30?

31:42.818 --> 31:43.819
No.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.788
Are you sure? Can you check?

31:46.863 --> 31:49.207
Don't have to.
My son works 6:00 to midnight.

31:49.282 --> 31:52.331
If a call comes in after that,
I get paged at home and take it myself.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.379
Last night was quiet.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.920
You sure don't look like a cop.

31:59.501 --> 32:03.131
Why don't you head across the street when
you're done? I'll meet you there for lunch.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.635
Sounds good.

32:06.466 --> 32:09.015
- So what's this all about?
- No, thanks.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.363
It's sort of a long shot, but...

32:21.022 --> 32:22.148
Um...

32:23.108 --> 32:25.236
At 2:30 this morning,

32:26.945 --> 32:29.289
a car horn woke up my grandmother,

32:29.364 --> 32:32.994
and she looked out the window
and she saw her Cadillac

32:33.827 --> 32:36.455
facing one of your vans in the street.

32:37.706 --> 32:42.177
Now, her car had been stolen, and
the guy that was trying to make a getaway

32:42.794 --> 32:45.092
was blocked by your van.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.805
And they crawled past each other,
and I just thought

32:48.884 --> 32:51.228
maybe your driver
got a good look at the guy.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.265
- Said it was one of our vans?
- Yeah, definitely.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.151
Nick, wake up! I need to talk to you.

33:05.442 --> 33:08.366
- Have I ever been out to your place before?
- Nope.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.288
- Hmm.

33:27.464 --> 33:29.262
Say hello to our visitor.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.350
Hi.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.265
I'm going to ask you
a simple question, Son.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.224
Lie to me, and I'm gonna ship you back
to your mother, you understand?

33:37.140 --> 33:38.141
Yeah.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.104
Did you drive the van last night?

33:44.523 --> 33:45.524
No.

33:47.651 --> 33:48.698
Like I said.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.619
One of your vans
was on my block last night,

33:53.698 --> 33:56.167
and it's really important
that you tell me how it got there

33:56.243 --> 33:57.961
because a crime was committed.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.798
What kind of crime?

34:01.873 --> 34:03.875
What the hell does that matter
if you didn't drive it?

34:03.959 --> 34:06.929
- Well, I'm just curious. Damn.
- Never mind about that.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.507
It seems your grandma was mistaken.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.301
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Stay back!

35:35.383 --> 35:38.557
Jesus! You crazy bitch.
What did I do to you?

35:38.637 --> 35:42.312
"Bitch"? Is that what you called my sister
when you pulled her out of her bed?

35:42.390 --> 35:45.394
- What? What are you talking about?
- This receipt!

35:45.477 --> 35:48.026
At 7:04 last night! You
started work at 6:00!

35:48.104 --> 35:50.698
You couldn't have been driving that,
but you were driving, because you lied!

35:50.774 --> 35:54.074
Okay, calm down.
Somebody else was driving the van.

35:57.238 --> 36:01.163
This guy came in.
He needed to move some tools, all right?

36:01.242 --> 36:04.542
He gave me a couple hundred bucks
to use the van for a few hours.

36:04.621 --> 36:05.964
By the time I got back from the club,

36:06.039 --> 36:08.713
this van was right here, all right?
With the key on the tire.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.588
- What was his name?
- Digger.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.260
Oh, what, is that a first name?

36:15.340 --> 36:17.718
I don't know. His name was Digger.
That's what he said.

36:17.801 --> 36:21.101
- What did he look like?
- He was tall. He wore a hat.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.937
That's it? You don't know where he lives?

36:25.058 --> 36:27.186
- He was there for five minutes.
- Think!

36:28.436 --> 36:30.438
Nick, where the hell did you go?

36:39.906 --> 36:41.123
Hey!

36:41.866 --> 36:44.039
- Hey, stop!

36:44.619 --> 36:45.791
Jesus!

36:46.621 --> 36:48.794
Yeah, you better get your <i>ass</i> out of here!

36:54.087 --> 36:56.181
<i>Man, Sarge has a short fuse.</i>

36:56.840 --> 36:59.184
I told a stupid joke,
he practically ripped my head off.

36:59.259 --> 37:02.103
No, he's not bad. It's just that you got soft.
How long were you on disability?

37:02.178 --> 37:05.808
- You homicide?
- Yeah. And it's his third day, so be gentle.

37:06.683 --> 37:07.730
What's up?

37:07.809 --> 37:11.109
Jill Conway just broke into
a locksmith's van over in Oakdale.

37:11.187 --> 37:14.236
When the locksmith's kid busted her,
she pulled out a .38.

37:18.194 --> 37:19.320
Shit.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.582
<i>You know what?
I have a better idea.</i>

37:22.657 --> 37:23.954
<i>Why don't you listen to me, okay?</i>

37:24.033 --> 37:27.003
<i>Because I'm the only one that's actually
trying to save my sister's life.</i>

37:27.120 --> 37:29.122
All right, what's on the receipt? Hurry up.

37:29.998 --> 37:34.378
Okay. Three rolls of duct tape,
plastic sheeting, 50 feet of rope,

37:34.461 --> 37:38.386
kerosene, and a lantern,
all bought yesterday by the same guy

37:38.465 --> 37:40.763
whose van was outside of my house
this morning.

37:40.842 --> 37:43.937
The locksmith's son said
he rented the van to a guy named Digger.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.272
<i>"Digger"? You get it?</i>

37:46.347 --> 37:47.348
I sure do.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.353
Hold on a second.

38:01.863 --> 38:03.331
Jill, are you carrying a gun?

38:04.073 --> 38:05.165
<i>Hmm?</i>

38:05.992 --> 38:07.710
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

38:07.786 --> 38:11.131
You were involuntarily committed
to a mental health facility.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.459
That means no firearms.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.877
So you get down here
with that gun right now,

38:16.002 --> 38:18.551
or it's going to get real bad
for you real fast. Okay?

38:20.006 --> 38:21.098
<i>Jill?</i>

38:23.927 --> 38:25.804
Jill, I do not have time for this.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.431
- Shit!

38:37.565 --> 38:40.569
- What do you want?
<i>- It's Hood. We're off speaker now.</i>

38:40.902 --> 38:44.247
Listen, I took a look at your file,
and I think you're right.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.745
I think the same guy
who grabbed you grabbed Molly.

38:47.075 --> 38:49.999
<i>I talked to my boss, to Lieutenant Bozeman.</i>

38:50.078 --> 38:53.378
- And?
- I laid my ass on the line for you, all right?

38:53.915 --> 38:55.542
I convinced him.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.799
<i>He gave me the case.
I'm the lead investigator.</i>

38:58.878 --> 39:00.380
<i>I'm going to find Molly.</i>

39:00.463 --> 39:02.431
<i>We'll do this together.</i>

39:04.342 --> 39:05.764
Hello? Are you there?

39:06.970 --> 39:09.268
- Yeah.
- Tell me where you are.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.356
<i>I'll come right over,
we'll get that gun squared away,</i>

39:14.435 --> 39:16.403
<i>and I'll take a look at that receipt.</i>

39:16.729 --> 39:18.857
We'll pay the hardware store
a little visit, okay?

39:19.440 --> 39:21.659
<i>Maybe even take a look around Forest Park.</i>

39:21.734 --> 39:24.783
- No, we won't. You'll lock me up.
<i>- What? No.</i>

39:25.071 --> 39:26.914
I want to help you, Jill.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.288
You have to trust me.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.453
You can't do this alone.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.460
Just watch me.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.845
We got a 12-34 out there waving a gun.
You know what that means?

39:47.927 --> 39:50.771
If she drops someone,
it's on us for wrongful death.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.317
Bring her in.

39:56.185 --> 39:58.904
Jill deactivated the GPS
on her iPhone.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.324
Have Marvin call up her tag,
then put out a BOLO.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.035
- Check the cell tower on that last call.
- Okay.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.163
She married you anyway?
What's wrong with her?

40:07.238 --> 40:09.661
Well,
because I didn't tell her about it.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.619
Oh! Okay.

I mean, what was I going to say to her?

"Baby, I banged your sister five years ago,

40:20.251 --> 40:23.346

at the beginning of the quarter.</i>

41:17.058 --> 41:19.857
He was always hitting on her,
trying to get her to smoke weed.

41:20.228 --> 41:23.027
The TA gave me his address.
He lives in a dorm.

41:23.356 --> 41:25.859
<i>- Willard Hall.</i>
- I used to live there freshman year.

41:25.942 --> 41:27.865
I'm five minutes away. What dorm number?

41:27.944 --> 41:30.197
- You sure?
<i>- Yes, give it to me.</i>

41:31.906 --> 41:32.907
713.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.709
<i>What about you? You find out anything?</i>

41:35.785 --> 41:37.332
Maybe. I'll call you back.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.671
Hi there. What can I do you for?

41:47.463 --> 41:52.185
This is going to sound kind of strange,
but my grandfather disappeared last night,

41:52.260 --> 41:53.887
and I was hoping
you could help me find him.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.473
He's got pretty advanced Alzheimer's.

41:56.556 --> 41:59.901
Here's how I see it. The first time
a man hits his wife, she's a victim.

41:59.976 --> 42:02.070
The second time, she's an accomplice.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.484
Harsh.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.233
Hey.

42:08.109 --> 42:10.658
Isn't that our BOLO? The Saab?

42:11.029 --> 42:12.997
216 DCB.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.455
Sure is.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.004
- 641, Dispatch.
- - Go ahead, 641.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.665
We have our suspect vehicle.

42:22.749 --> 42:26.219
His next-door neighbor said
he saw him leave about 3:00 with a friend,

42:26.294 --> 42:29.138
but I have no idea which
friend he left with.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.641
But I did find this receipt from here.

42:31.716 --> 42:35.562
It looks like they were here about 7:04.
Do you have a surveillance camera?

42:35.636 --> 42:37.730
Oh, no. We're not Home Depot.

42:38.598 --> 42:40.817
Were you working yesterday at 7:04?

42:40.892 --> 42:42.894
I'm always working, dear. I own the place.

42:42.977 --> 42:45.446
Maybe you remember
my grandfather and his friend?

42:45.521 --> 42:46.647
- Hmm.
- 'Cause that was...

42:46.731 --> 42:48.404
Sir, if you wouldn't mind,
checkout is right at the front.

42:48.483 --> 42:50.656
- Thank you. I will.
- You come back and see us, now.

42:50.735 --> 42:53.659
<i>- Do you have a visual?</i>
- Negative. Can't tell if it's occupied.

42:53.738 --> 42:56.491
<i>Non-emergency off the air
until cover arrives.</i>

42:56.574 --> 42:59.043
Standing by for cover. Start us more units.

42:59.118 --> 43:02.167
- It was a pretty big sale.
- Oh, yeah, I remember this.

43:02.705 --> 43:05.208
Only it wasn't two guys.
It was only one guy.

43:05.291 --> 43:07.794
He wasn't your grandfather.
He was only about 40.

43:08.461 --> 43:09.508
Oh!

43:09.879 --> 43:11.381
I know who it is.

43:11.464 --> 43:15.059
I think it's the guy my grandfather
used to go fishing with.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.353
- His name is Digger. His nickname's Digger.
- Mmm-hmm.

43:17.428 --> 43:20.602
I don't know his real name, though.
Did he use a credit card, by any chance?

43:20.681 --> 43:22.433
- Nope. He paid with cash.

43:23.976 --> 43:26.354
- Do you remember anything else about him?
- Well...

43:27.647 --> 43:30.617
I know that he drove
a 1990 Chrysler Imperial

43:30.691 --> 43:34.571
with 176,000 miles on it.
I only know that 'cause he told me.

43:34.695 --> 43:39.576
Pretty proud of that crate. No
idea why, but he parked it right up front.

43:39.659 --> 43:43.038
- What color was it?
- It was kind of a burgundy.

43:54.382 --> 43:57.727
Can I give you my phone number
in case you remember anything else?

43:57.802 --> 44:01.397
You know what?
I know where he lives. How's that?

44:02.306 --> 44:05.901
He told me that the powers that be
at the Royal Hotel

44:05.977 --> 44:09.277
evicted him because
his car took up two parking spots.

44:09.355 --> 44:12.325
- They can evict you for that?
- I figured he was pulling my leg about that.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.495
I don't know. I've never heard of that.
Royal Hotel?

44:16.154 --> 44:19.328
- It's up on Halsted, I think.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.910
You're welcome. I hope you find him.

44:33.713 --> 44:37.138
Uh... Female emergency.
Do you have a restroom?

44:37.216 --> 44:40.140
Sure, yeah. Right this way.
It's in the back.

44:52.398 --> 44:53.866
There you go.

45:04.577 --> 45:06.375
Officers, what's going on?

45:06.454 --> 45:08.707
We're looking for the owner
of a vehicle parked outside.

45:08.789 --> 45:11.133
It's a young woman, blonde hair, blue eyes.

45:11.209 --> 45:12.756
I don't know if it's who
you're looking for,

45:12.835 --> 45:14.553
but there's somebody like that
in the restroom.

45:14.629 --> 45:16.051
- Where is it?
- She'll be right back out.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.382
Show me.

45:35.650 --> 45:37.652
Can you please hurry it up in there?

45:39.445 --> 45:40.492
Hello?

45:43.074 --> 45:45.543
We have shots fired!
One from inside the bathroom!

45:45.618 --> 45:47.620
Police! Open the door now!

45:52.500 --> 45:54.502
On the floor, on the floor!

45:55.503 --> 45:56.675
She's gone.

45:56.754 --> 45:59.428
She bailed. She went out
the south side of the building.

46:57.898 --> 47:00.947
- Hey, can I bum a cigarette?
- We don't smoke.

47:01.569 --> 47:02.661
Sorry.

47:02.737 --> 47:05.707
Yeah, I shouldn't, either. My mom died
from lung cancer when she was 47.

47:05.781 --> 47:08.000
It was the worst, most tragic thing ever.

47:09.076 --> 47:12.000
How do you guys like this neighborhood?
I'm thinking about moving in.

47:12.079 --> 47:14.332
It's okay. Our school's
two blocks that way.

47:14.415 --> 47:16.964
We eat lunch at home. How lame is that?

47:18.002 --> 47:21.506
There's hardly anything to do here,
you know? The nearest mall is really far.

47:21.589 --> 47:23.057
Yeah, I hate that.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.890
Anyway, bye

47:32.808 --> 47:33.934
Hey.

47:34.018 --> 47:37.443
I know something that would be totally fun.

47:37.521 --> 47:39.774
How would you like to see Justin Bieber
at the Rose Garden?

47:41.150 --> 47:44.074
Are you serious? He was just here.
I didn't think he was coming back.

47:44.153 --> 47:46.406
Oh, yeah. My brother's his tour manager.

47:46.781 --> 47:49.705
I've had dinner with him three times.

47:49.784 --> 47:51.457
I can get you backstage passes.

47:58.376 --> 47:59.673
- Oh, my God!
- You're not serious.

48:00.920 --> 48:02.217
So what's Justin like?

48:02.296 --> 48:04.719
Where's bad cop, huh?
Is he typing up my arrest warrant?

48:04.799 --> 48:06.221
<i>Jill, it's Hood. Listen to me.</i>

48:06.300 --> 48:08.473
You know what? If you don't want
to do your job, that's fine.

48:08.552 --> 48:10.054
<i>- Listen.</i>
- But you got to stay out of my way.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.523
My mom.

48:14.642 --> 48:18.488
- I thought she died of lung cancer.
- It's a long story.

48:33.828 --> 48:36.957
- What? Leave me alone.
- Trey, it's important! Open up.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.844
I'm not leaving.

48:43.379 --> 48:46.349
- What do you want?
- You missed your econ final.

48:47.049 --> 48:49.893
Yeah, I had a gig last night.
I overslept. Who the hell are you?

48:50.177 --> 48:52.771
- I'm Molly Conway's sister.
- Who? Oh.

48:53.431 --> 48:55.229
- Yeah, she missed it, too.
- So?

48:55.307 --> 48:57.435
- Was she at your gig last night?

48:57.518 --> 49:00.522
She hates me. She thinks I'm a drug addict.
Why would she be at my gig?

49:00.980 --> 49:03.654
- I want to come in.
- She's not here, all right?

49:04.859 --> 49:06.076
Hey! What the...

49:06.735 --> 49:07.907
Molly?

49:08.237 --> 49:09.363
Molly!

49:16.787 --> 49:18.255
Crazy bitch.

49:22.209 --> 49:24.803
Okay, let's call it. Units can go mobile.

49:26.547 --> 49:30.017
- We lost her. She's in the wind.
- Maybe not. Hang on.

49:30.092 --> 49:33.392
Her last call just pinged off
the Tyler Street tower.

49:33.471 --> 49:36.395
That's inside the perimeter.
She could be just laying low.

49:36.474 --> 49:37.817
Who needs this shit?

49:37.892 --> 49:41.692
Call the cab companies, call the car rentals.
Get her ass in here!

50:03.667 --> 50:04.759
Shit.

50:36.283 --> 50:38.126
Excuse me. Hey.

50:38.786 --> 50:40.880
- Do you live around here?
- Yeah.

50:40.955 --> 50:43.378
I was hanging out with a friend
the other day,

50:43.457 --> 50:46.006
and this guy came and clipped my car
and just drove away.

50:46.794 --> 50:51.095
Her little brother looked out the window
and said he saw this crate.

50:51.173 --> 50:54.803
- A dark red Chrysler Imperial.
- Yeah. That's Jim Lapointe.

50:55.219 --> 50:58.314
- Who is that?
- He lives right below us. 2A.

50:58.389 --> 51:00.141
Awesome! Thank you.

51:02.226 --> 51:05.400
He's okay, right?
He's not going to shoot me in the head

51:05.479 --> 51:07.732
if I knock on his door
and ask for his insurance, right?

51:07.815 --> 51:11.820
He might. He's pretty weird. My girlfriend
says he's got "rapey eyes," so I don't know.

51:14.238 --> 51:15.831
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

52:25.267 --> 52:26.439
Hello?

53:29.915 --> 53:31.132
Help!

53:34.753 --> 53:36.050
Help!

53:36.839 --> 53:38.432
Help!

53:39.633 --> 53:40.976
Someone, help me!

54:47.576 --> 54:49.704
- Can I get you anything else?
- Just the check.

54:59.213 --> 55:00.260
- Hey!

55:00.964 --> 55:02.466
- Hey! Hey!

55:02.549 --> 55:05.928
I'm the janitor! What did you do that for?

55:06.762 --> 55:09.641
I thought you were someone else.
You have no right to put your hands on me.

55:09.723 --> 55:12.351
Well, you have no right
to be snooping around on private property!

55:12.434 --> 55:14.232
- You're right. Sorry.

55:15.312 --> 55:16.780
Are you okay?

55:17.439 --> 55:18.782
No, I'm not.

55:21.902 --> 55:25.907
So, this guy, Mr. Lapointe,
did he leave a forwarding address?

55:25.989 --> 55:28.242
Nope. He moved up north.

55:28.325 --> 55:30.828
- Where?
- Man, you really messed up my wrist.

55:30.911 --> 55:32.584
Did he say where?

55:33.831 --> 55:37.961
He just said he was going to tie up
some loose ends and head north.

55:38.836 --> 55:40.554
What, does he owe you money
or something?

55:40.629 --> 55:43.178
No. He used to do lawn work
for my aunt and she died.

55:43.257 --> 55:45.180
She left him $20,000 in her will.

55:45.384 --> 55:49.514
- Oh! That's some lawn work.
- Yeah. She was crazy.

55:49.596 --> 55:51.473
And mean. She was really mean.

55:51.557 --> 55:55.061
She didn't give me a cent, actually.
I did everything for her.

55:55.143 --> 55:56.736
Of all the days
for my car to break down.

55:58.564 --> 56:00.908
- Do you want to make some money?
- Always.

56:01.358 --> 56:03.531
- Do you have a car?
- Barely.

56:04.319 --> 56:05.536
It's a hunk of junk.

56:09.324 --> 56:13.249
I always figured if I met a girl as pretty
as you, money would change hands.

56:13.328 --> 56:15.251
I just thought it would be
in the other direction.

56:15.789 --> 56:18.508
I must be crazy.

56:18.959 --> 56:21.633
- This time tomorrow, right?
- Yep. Key under the right rear.

56:21.712 --> 56:23.214
- You swear?
- Yeah.

56:23.297 --> 56:25.720
- What if you don't show?
- It means I'm dead.

56:41.857 --> 56:45.077
- I can't believe they involved you in this.
- Jill, it's my job.

56:45.152 --> 56:47.405
<i>If I needed you, I would have called you.
You know that.</i>

56:47.487 --> 56:50.036
Yeah, under normal circumstances,
of course you would.

56:50.657 --> 56:52.785
<i>Just tell me what's happened.</i>

56:52.868 --> 56:54.370
We always talked about him coming back

56:54.453 --> 56:56.831
like it would never happen,
like it was just me being paranoid.

56:56.914 --> 56:59.167
But we were wrong
and he did come back and he took Molly.

56:59.249 --> 57:01.297
<i>And if anything happened, I swear to God...</i>

57:01.376 --> 57:03.504
The police tell me that
you're carrying a gun.

57:03.587 --> 57:04.884
Yes, I'm carrying a gun!

57:04.963 --> 57:08.137
But if I turn myself in, then no one will be
looking for her, and then he'll kill her!

57:08.216 --> 57:10.264
Shh, sweetheart, listen to me, okay?

57:10.344 --> 57:12.096
<i>Just breathe and listen.</i>

57:13.013 --> 57:15.562
<i>You have suffered terribly this past year,</i>

57:16.016 --> 57:18.394
but you came to understand your anxiety,

57:18.810 --> 57:22.690
<i>and that it was never to be acted upon.
Isn't that what you've learned?</i>

57:23.523 --> 57:26.902
<i>Now, the police,
they don't believe he ever existed.</i>

57:26.985 --> 57:29.033
I do believe he exists,

57:29.112 --> 57:31.740
and I know what happened to you was real.

57:32.366 --> 57:34.915
- You believe me, don't you? <i>
</i>- Yes.

57:34.993 --> 57:38.918
But at the same time,
I know that he hasn't returned.

57:38.997 --> 57:41.125
<i>When Molly behaved irresponsibly,</i>

57:41.208 --> 57:45.588
<i>when she wasn't home when you
expected her to be, it triggered memories.</i>

58:20.539 --> 58:22.416
Oh, God!

58:23.375 --> 58:27.755
<i>Jill, he's gone
and he is never coming back.</i>

58:28.088 --> 58:29.931
<i>He belongs to your past now.</i>

58:30.007 --> 58:31.179
No.

58:31.258 --> 58:34.979
Sweetheart, come in right now. Talk to me.

58:35.053 --> 58:37.852
<i>Before you hurt yourself or somebody else.</i>

58:38.765 --> 58:39.937
I'll come up.

58:40.434 --> 58:42.857
<i>- But only if you do something first.</i>
- What?

58:43.603 --> 58:46.823
Tell Sergeant Powers to leave,
and when he's gone, I'll come up.

58:47.065 --> 58:49.409
What are you talking about?
There are no police here.

58:49.484 --> 58:50.531
You're a liar.

58:50.610 --> 58:53.830
<i>- No, I...</i>
- I'm parked downstairs,

58:53.905 --> 58:57.330
<i>and I can see his unmarked cop car
right in front of me.</i>

58:58.160 --> 59:00.879
- Jill.
- My judgment isn't impaired.

59:04.458 --> 59:06.051
She's downstairs.

59:06.626 --> 59:09.800
Suspect's vehicle downstairs. Take her.
If it's rolling, put a stop on it.

59:18.221 --> 59:19.473
Hold up.

59:30.150 --> 59:33.279
- Ready or not, here I come.

59:35.822 --> 59:37.540
Where are my boys?

59:38.325 --> 59:40.043
I can't find them anywhere.

59:41.453 --> 59:43.672
Is one of my boys at the door?

59:47.209 --> 59:49.052
I need to talk to you.

59:50.796 --> 59:52.673
Come on out, boys. My friend is here.

59:53.006 --> 59:55.304
We'll play hide-and-seek later, okay?

59:55.634 --> 01:00:00.014
Why don't you watch some TV?
Good spots. I never would've found you.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.349
Go ahead.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:04.192
I never would've found you.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.439
Have you been to sleep yet?

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:08.443
Molly disappeared last night
and the guy who took me took her,

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:10.616
and it's going to get dark soon
and he's going to kill her.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.694
I think I know who it is.
I think it's that customer.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:17.623
The guy that gave us the big tip last night,
the one that you said was moving away?

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:20.625
- Jim?
- "Jim"? You know his name?

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.249
- Yeah.
- Do you know him pretty well?

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:26.131
No. He comes in every couple of weeks.
We chat.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.800
- Did he ever ask about me?
- No.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:33.472
He stares at me. Last night was the
first time he's ever sat in my section.

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:35.845
The only thing that he said to me was,
"More coffee, please."

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:39.679
I think he was just afraid
that I would recognize his voice.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.320
It's time.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.359
Oh, God.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.569
You never got a good look at him?

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.748
- Have you ever seen him with his car?
- No.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.622
So you don't know anything else about him?

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:04.078
No, not really.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:07.251
He lives alone. He works odd jobs.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:10.129
I asked him why he was moving,
and he said he didn't like the women here.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:12.761
I said, "Why, what's wrong with us?"
"Too skinny."

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:14.963
I said, "Well, I'll take
that as a compliment."

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:16.423
Nothing else?

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:20.636
- Well...
- What?

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:22.637
Tell me.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.850
I have his phone number.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.436
I threw it away out here.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.695
He gave it to me last night.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:43.033
Here's what I think we should do. I think we
should give it to the cops and let them...

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:44.288
Jill.

01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:46.494
Jill.

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:50.295
Don't do this, Jill.

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:52.126
Please, you need help.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.571
- Are you kidding me?
- Here we go.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:30.501
- Okay, it's on.
- Yeah, she's going for it.

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:36.002
<i>Orange Bronco.</i>

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:40.261
<i>Oregon plate 071 Charles Baker Victor.</i>

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.313
Hey. Jill just left a friend's house
in Ladd's Addition.

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:31.016
Now her friend hears sirens
and she's scared.

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:33.227
There's a pursuit rolling
in Ladd's Addition right now.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.311
Where's Hood?

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:36.067
His mom's sick.
He says he's bringing her soup.

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:39.073
Oh, great. Check with dispatch.
Find out what they're chasing.

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:50.494
<i>951, we're southbound on Carver.</i>

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.875
<i>We've lost sight of the suspect vehicle.</i>

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:54.915
<i>She's blacked it out.
She's taking the alley.</i>

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.045
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:57.546
<i>There it is.</i>

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:03.261
All right! In the car, show your hands!

01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:42.220
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Where are your car keys?

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:46.095
- Why?
- Just please give them to me.

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:47.175
No.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.687
If they catch me, they're going to
throw me back in the hospital,

01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:52.139
and they're going to
ask me a thousand questions,

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:54.645
and I'm not going to be able to answer,
'cause I'm going to sound crazy.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:57.022
They're going to stand there
with their notepads,

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.855
and they're going to make me
take all these pills, and when I refuse,

01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:03.533
it'll make me seem even crazier.
Meanwhile, Molly is going to be dead,

01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:07.112
buried at the bottom
of some hole in Forest Park,

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:10.324
along with all these other girls
that nobody's looking for.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:14.162
And then, one day, someone's going to
accidentally stumble over their bones.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:16.246
And the cops are going to say,

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:18.707
"Wow, what do you know?
That Conway girl was right."

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:22.419
And they're going to go on living their lives.
But I will never be able to do that

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:25.756
because I know that I didn't do
everything possible to save my sister.

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:29.013
And so how are you going to feel
when you didn't help me?

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:32.687
- Mommy, I'm hungry.
- Yeah? What do you want, sweetie?

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:34.597
Do you want an apple?

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:42.689
My keys are in my purse on that desk.

01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:45.233
And don't you come back here.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.624
<i>Jim here.</i>
- Hi.

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:44.963
<i>Who's this?</i>

01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:48.380
- Jill.
<i>- Jill who?</i>

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:51.220
You know who I am.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:54.928
I know who you are.

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:57.263
And I know you have my sister.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:59.395
<i>I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.</i>

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:01.351
You stared at me for months.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:04.691
You finally sat at my station last night,

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.990
and then you went
and you broke into my home,

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:09.693
and you meant to take me,
but you took my sister instead.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:13.622
<i>- Is this Jill from the Lucky Star?
- Yes! Stop it! Stop it.</i>

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.787
<i>I left you a pretty big tip last night.</i>

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:19.035
Yeah.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:21.997
<i>And then I went to your house
to kidnap you?</i>

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.756
<i>Why would I do that if I knew you were
working the night shift like you always do?</i>

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:30.259
<i>But you're right about one thing.
I do know who you are.</i>

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:33.512
<i>You're that poor girl
who was abducted last year.</i>

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:36.560
<i>The one no one believes.</i>

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:40.645
<i>The police said it was a hoax
and that you were crazy, right?</i>

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:42.441
<i>Pigs.</i>

01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:46.985
<i>You sound like
you're in a very bad place right now.</i>

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:52.320
<i>Would you like to meet me and see that
I'm not the monster you think I am?</i>

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.538
<i>Maybe then you'll relax.</i>

01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:57.703
<i>Be happy.</i>

01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.917
<i>Smile.</i>

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.670
<i>You may even like me.</i>

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:05.377
Okay.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:10.175
<i>Do you want me to come to you?
Or do you want to come to me?</i>

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:17.723
I'll come to you. Where are you?

01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:20.805
<i>I'm sort of homeless right now.</i>

01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:24.688
<i>I'm just tying up a few loose ends
before I move back north.</i>

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:27.020
<i>Here's what you do.</i>

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:30.694
<i>Cross over the St. John's Bridge
and turn right onto Bridge Avenue,</i>

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.492
<i>and take it to Springville Road
for about three miles.</i>

01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:37.537
<i>On the left, you'll see
an abandoned ranger station.</i>

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.703
<i>Call me when you get there, okay?</i>

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:42.331
<i>And, Jill,</i>

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:45.045
<i>you drive careful now.</i>

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:17.118
- Hello?
<i>- Hey. Molly's back.</i>

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:20.582
- What?
- I'm at your house right now. She's here.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:22.580
- Are you serious?
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:26.538
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That means that...

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:29.502
- Put her on.
<i>- She's in the shower.</i>

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:33.301
<i>- What?
- Stop being such a weirdo. She's back.</i>

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:36.301
Look, she was so stressed out
about the exam,

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:39.510
<i>she went out with Sarah.
Not to drink, just to watch, right?</i>

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:41.595
<i>Of course, she got wasted.</i>

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:44.557
Passed out on the couch,
slept right through the test.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:48.064
<i>She was too embarrassed to call.
She just came back 20 minutes ago in a cab.</i>

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:51.188
Now she wants us to
take her to an AA meeting.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.772
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:55.108
I know, so hurry up
. She's dying to see you.

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:57.068
<i>Billy,</i>

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.033
put Molly on the phone, please.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:00.864
<i>I can't. I told you, she's in the shower.</i>

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:06.624
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Hey. Okay, she's on her way home.

01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:10.381
Okay. Then will you ask her
something for me?

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:11.965
What?

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.844
Ask her why she went out drinking
in a pajama top.

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:16.011
<i>Jill.</i>

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.010
Uh...

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:22.969
Look, I'm freaking out over here.

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:25.855
<i>There are cop cars parked outside.</i>

01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:29.567
They're not going to talk to me about Molly.
All they care about is you.

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:33.521
<i>So unless you turn yourself in,
they're never going to look for her.</i>

01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:36.278
- I'm on my way to meet him right now.
- Who?

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:37.825
<i>The guy who took her.</i>

01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:40.153
- I just got off the phone with him.
<i>- Wait, he...</i>

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.247
- He admitted it?
- No, but he's the one.

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:16.064
Hello?

01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:34.503
She says she's meeting the guy
who kidnapped her and Molly.

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:37.552
- Where?
- I don't know.

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:40.304
Jesus.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:43.724
So what if Jill isn't crazy?
What if this guy really does have Molly?

01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:47.595
She's still missing.
Something must've happened to her.

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:08.787
What do you want?

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:09.992
<i>What the hell
do you think you're doing?</i>

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:11.123
Your job.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:12.917
You think this is
how an investigation works,

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:14.588
you are dreaming, Jill.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:15.836
You know, I'll tell you where Molly is.

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:18.543
She couldn't stand looking after you
one minute more, so she took off.

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:19.752
<i>She needed a break.</i>

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:21.930
<i>That's why she moved in, you know.
To babysit you.</i>

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.631
<i>- It was my idea
- No.</i>

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:25.682
<i>Yeah, I thought
without some human contact,</i>

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:28.011
<i>you'd end up in a hospital
for the rest of your life.</i>

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.855
They don't believe me.

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.603
- They think I made it up!
- Okay, okay. Shh, shh!

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:36.645
- They won't even let me go home.
- Just come here, okay?

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:39.776
I'll talk to the doctors and
I will get you out of here, I promise.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:42.367
- No, she would've told me that.
<i>- How?</i>

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:45.445
There's no telling you anything, Jill.
You won't let anyone help you.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.079
<i>- Now, look, you do as I say and you...</i>

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:48.371
That's him.

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:49.873
Ji...

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:55.751
<i>- You're at the ranger station?</i>
- Yeah.

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:58.333
<i>Good. Turn left out of the lot.</i>

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:17.894
Do you have Molly? Please
tell me the truth.

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:19.812
<i>I don't have her.</i>

01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:24.742
<i>Soon you'll see a road,
but it's not well-marked.</i>

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:26.778
I see a chain.

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:29.622
<i>That's it. Get out and move it.</i>

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:30.744
Hold on.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.601
Take the road?

01:13:58.851 --> 01:13:59.977
Yes.

01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:07.986
How far?

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:10.329
<i>Until it ends.</i>

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:15.163
<i>Forest Park is a magical place, isn't it?</i>

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.879
I come here all the time.

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:22.713
<i>Did you ever hear about the little girl
who lived out with her father?</i>

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:26.095
<i>They lived in a cave together for years.</i>

01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:27.881
<i>They bathed in a brook.</i>

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:31.718
<i>The water kept their perishables cool.</i>

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:33.886
<i>They grew a garden.</i>

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:37.143
<i>Instead of her going to school,</i>

01:14:37.765 --> 01:14:40.393
<i>her dad taught her everything he knew.</i>

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:45.982
<i>They were very, very happy
and no one was the wiser.</i>

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:50.411
<i>When I read about what happened to you,</i>

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:54.081
<i>I couldn't believe they called the
search off after only one week.</i>

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:58.920
<i>Did they really think they'd find a hole
in the middle of 5,000 acres so easily,</i>

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:03.425
<i>when this little girl and her father
were never discovered?</i>

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:05.839
<i>Will you tell me something?</i>

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.090
Sure.

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:09.005
<i>How did you escape?</i>

01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:12.425
<i>They said you overcame him.</i>

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:15.224
<i>What does that mean?</i>

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:19.436
It was a couple of hours
after the sun went down.

01:15:19.974 --> 01:15:21.772
It's time.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.441
Oh, my God.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.116
<i>There was a bone. A forearm, I think.</i>

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:33.780
<i>Maybe it was a shin.
It was broken, splintered.</i>

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.623
Sweetheart, I'm here.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.592
<i>I really don't remember much,</i>

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:48.711
<i>but I do remember</i>

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:51.847
<i>that I had never felt so cold and tired</i>

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:54.134
<i>in my life.</i>

01:15:58.137 --> 01:16:00.310
<i>And he'd never been so mad.</i>

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.017
<i>You got away.</i>

01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:06.274
<i>You made a fool of him.</i>

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:10.776
<i>I bet he didn't like that one little bit.</i>

01:16:10.858 --> 01:16:12.860
Can I ask you something?

01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:15.036
<i>Sure.</i>

01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:19.663
What did you do to the girl
whose bone I found?

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:23.792
How did it split into two like that?

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:36.843
- I'm at a fork.
- Turn <i>left.</i>

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:41.021
Where does right lead?

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.024
<i>Back to civilization.</i>

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:57.030
Am I close?

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:59.365
<i>Keep driving.</i>

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:02.576
You're waiting for me?

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:04.837
<i>Of course.</i>

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:10.752
Hello?

01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:12.337
You there?

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:15.222
<i>You're a brave girl.</i>

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:19.935
<i>Driving out in the middle of the night
to meet a man you hardly know.</i>

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:21.057
How far?

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:23.889
<i>When the road ends, get out of the car.</i>

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.517
<i>You'll see a footpath.</i>

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:28.395
<i>Take it.</i>

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:33.491
<i>You'll know you've reached my campsite
when you see a lantern.</i>

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:37.615
I'm losing you.

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:39.659
Uh...

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:42.617
- Hello?
- There's no service out here

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.749
But we've been talking.

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:50.383
Where are you? You're waiting, right?

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.376
Right?

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:53.585
- Hello?

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.425
Come on!

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:31.501
Molly!

01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:58.789
Wait, Molly's here! She's here!

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:01.296
Molly!

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.168
Molly!

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:05.801
- Hey, come here. Oh, my God!
- Billy.

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:08.098
- Where were you?
- Under the house.

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:11.848
He grabbed me when I was sleeping,

01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:14.355
and he hit me, and he drugged me.

01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:17.691
Where's Jill?

01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:28.111
- Where is she?
- Hey, listen. Listen.

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.194
We have to get you to the hospital.

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:31.155
Not till I see Jill! Where is she?

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:34.538
Molly, look at me.
She's meeting some guy, okay?

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:37.335
She thinks he is the one that took her
and that he has you now.

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:38.879
What? What?

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:41.047
- You never believed her.
- Come on.

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:44.093
He's going to kill her this time!
How could you let that happen?

01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:47.092
You have to stop her! You have to stop her.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:54.724
Molly! Molly, I'm here!

01:23:12.946 --> 01:23:14.198
Welcome back.

01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:16.412
Just us again.

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:18.502
And the others.

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:20.420
Poor Jill.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:23.544
The girl no one believes.

01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:25.422
Not even the police.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:28.929
But you and I know the truth,
that this is where you belong.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.849
It was so easy to lead you back.

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:33.725
I think you never wanted to leave.

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:39.268
Remember this?

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:20.643
Don't move, you fucking coward.

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:22.398
Where's Molly?

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:24.977
Kill me, and you'll never know.

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:28.863
Where is she?

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:31.066
Get me help first, and I'll tell you.

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:35.329
If you tell me where she is,
I won't shoot you again.

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:38.369
But you have five seconds.

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:42.954
You stupid bitch, she's alive.

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:47.170
She's under your house.
She's been there the whole time.

01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:55.261
My God. Oh, my God.

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:04.100
I told you the truth.
You said you wouldn't shoot me.

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:07.109
I won't.

01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:13.237
Hurry!

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:15.240
I need help now!

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:19.957
No! Please.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:23.995
Please don't. Please.

01:25:25.203 --> 01:25:26.375
Please.

01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:29.383
You said you wouldn't kill me.

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:34.380
Please! You said you wouldn't kill me.

01:25:34.463 --> 01:25:35.555
I lied.

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:04.644
Sergeant, incoming.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.142
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:08.644
- It's my house.
- Let her through. Let her in.

01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:22.537
He drugged me, he tied me up,
and he put me under the house!

01:27:24.364 --> 01:27:28.085
- Shh. We're safe.
- He's going to come back for you, Jill.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.709
- He's not going to stop.
- We're fine.

01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:33.048
- We're going to be safe.
- Okay.

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:40.388
Okay?

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:45.852
- Jill, where's the gun?
- There's no gun.

01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:49.811
- What happened out there?
- There was nobody there.

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:51.941
What do you mean?

01:27:52.017 --> 01:27:54.111
Jill, somebody pulled your sister
out of that bed.

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:57.030
- That guy you were meeting?
- He never existed.

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:02.694
It was all in my head.

01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:15.524
Powers?

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:17.856
Get in here.
