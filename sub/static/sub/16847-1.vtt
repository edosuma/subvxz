Mr. Barnes, I'm Dr. Carter.

18:06.417 --> 18:09.652
I was at LETAC for yesterday's
simulation test run,

18:09.720 --> 18:11.754
but we were never introduced.

18:11.923 --> 18:13.523
How you doing?

18:13.590 --> 18:15.491
Chief Cochran asked me

18:15.559 --> 18:17.994
to do an independent
psychological evaluation of you

18:18.062 --> 18:21.998
that might help you build a

18:22.066 --> 18:25.218
I need you to be as honest
as you can.

18:25.436 --> 18:27.603

18:29.123 --> 18:30.590

18:39.767 --> 18:41.200

18:41.268 --> 18:43.035

18:44.872 --> 18:46.573
I read the official report.

18:46.640 --> 18:50.076
I'd like to hear your
version of what happened.

18:50.143 --> 18:52.378
I defended myself.

18:52.446 --> 18:55.482
The report said the guards

18:55.883 --> 18:58.017
had to pull you off the other man,

18:58.369 --> 19:00.553
that you were trying to kill him.

19:00.621 --> 19:02.255
No. I was defending myself.

19:02.390 --> 19:04.524
Were you angry about what
had happened at LETAC?

19:04.925 --> 19:07.460
No. I was defending myself.

19:07.528 --> 19:10.229
But you could see how,
looking at your history,

19:10.297 --> 19:11.998
someone could
infer that--

19:12.065 --> 19:14.333
that I was angry?
That I'm violent?

19:14.402 --> 19:16.168
You can infer that I was angry

19:16.236 --> 19:18.505
about not making my
junior-high baseball team.

19:18.572 --> 19:20.373
That doesn't mean I
killed the coach.

19:20.408 --> 19:23.342
Were you attracted to
violence as a child?

19:23.444 --> 19:25.912
Yes. Three stooges,

Mmm!

Fuck you!

50:40.436 --> 50:42.637
You know, Parker, I've been thinking.

50:42.705 --> 50:45.907
We have so much in
common psychologically.

50:45.941 --> 50:48.443
Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Carter?

50:49.978 --> 50:52.146
We have such a history together.

50:52.214 --> 50:55.817
We'd make a great team, a dynamic duo.

51:42.431 --> 51:43.631

51:43.699 --> 51:46.133
The only way to stop him

51:46.201 --> 51:48.970

51:49.004 --> 51:50.772
Hey, Parker!

51:51.006 --> 51:51.873
Ready?

51:51.941 --> 51:52.941
Yeah.

52:30.679 --> 52:33.114
Could we at least advise Mr. Barnes

52:33.181 --> 52:35.617
that we prefer to have
SID 6.7 subdued

52:35.684 --> 52:37.118
as opposed to terminated?

52:37.185 --> 52:39.621
It's a crying shame
we're going to destroy

52:40.022 --> 52:42.123
the prototype of future
humanoid nanotechnology.

52:42.190 --> 52:44.626
Did they find the programmer yet?

52:44.693 --> 52:46.127
Lindenmeyer. No, not yet.

52:46.194 --> 52:49.130
You'd think the cops
could at least find him.

52:49.197 --> 52:51.699
Lindenmeyer was your
programmer, Mr. Wallace.

52:53.702 --> 52:57.038
[Parker] I shot at
the guy 30 or 40 times.

52:57.072 --> 53:00.074

53:03.111 --> 53:05.379
I'm sorry, Billy.
All right? Shoot me.

53:05.581 --> 53:09.350
This is not a game, but
SID is from the game.

53:09.418 --> 53:13.505
I can't catch him if
I'm in the penitentiary.

53:13.572 --> 53:16.257
Matthew Grimes is a
part of SID 6.7.

53:16.324 --> 53:18.560
There's no doubt about that.

53:18.627 --> 53:20.762
Last night, SID tried taunting me,

53:20.829 --> 53:24.015
like Grimes used to do.
Look at this.

53:24.082 --> 53:25.600
[Madison] We don't
know he's the dominant.

53:25.668 --> 53:27.068
I know. I know.

53:27.135 --> 53:29.521
That's how I know,
because I know.

53:29.588 --> 53:31.523
Maybe that's what SID
wants you to think.

53:31.590 --> 53:34.609
Push you over the
edge, make you slip up.

53:34.677 --> 53:37.579
Sid did not push me
over the edge,

53:37.646 --> 53:40.081
and I did not slip up.

53:40.148 --> 53:41.916
Take a look at this.

53:42.117 --> 53:44.852
This is SID from the
media zone last night,

53:44.920 --> 53:46.854
taken from their own recordings.

53:46.922 --> 53:49.223
He can't get enough of himself.

53:49.625 --> 53:52.126
He's going to want more
victims, bigger events,

53:52.194 --> 53:55.129
and more coverage, just
like Matthew Grimes.

53:55.197 --> 53:57.632
Matthew Grimes was a
political terrorist

53:57.700 --> 54:01.135
whose specialty was
bombing populated targets--

54:01.203 --> 54:02.604
any mass expression of democracy,

54:02.671 --> 54:05.073
anywhere where a lot of
people can die

54:05.140 --> 54:08.242
and it can be recorded
by the news media live.

54:08.644 --> 54:10.244
This behavior was never part

54:10.312 --> 54:11.746
of his original programming.

54:12.147 --> 54:15.750
SID 6.7 isn't bound
by programming anymore.

54:16.151 --> 54:17.118
What does that mean?

54:17.185 --> 54:20.254
In the real world, he's
free of any behavioral limits

54:20.322 --> 54:22.757
he might have had in
virtual reality.

54:23.158 --> 54:25.292

01:15:18.061 --> 01:15:22.365
[Man] What's going on in
there? We just lost New York!

01:15:22.432 --> 01:15:24.334
Wait a minute!

01:15:24.401 --> 01:15:26.936
You guys asleep?

01:15:32.576 --> 01:15:35.245
Ladies and gentlemen,
my fellow Americans...

01:15:35.313 --> 01:15:37.580
What the hell?

01:15:37.648 --> 01:15:38.581
Welcome...

01:15:38.649 --> 01:15:41.567
What's happening out there?

01:15:41.635 --> 01:15:43.252
No!

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.520
[Woman screams]

01:15:44.588 --> 01:15:47.289
To death TV.

01:16:09.747 --> 01:16:11.681
[Man] They're still up there!

01:16:11.749 --> 01:16:14.684
Please move back now!

01:16:14.752 --> 01:16:19.856
<i>[Sid] Why make a promise like
that without being able to deliver?</i>

01:16:19.924 --> 01:16:22.358
Rafael debaca has just
been executed

01:16:22.426 --> 01:16:24.027
during a live broadcast...

01:16:24.094 --> 01:16:26.529
<i>So, people, what
do you want--</i>

01:16:26.597 --> 01:16:27.864
<i>strangulation, mutilation,</i>

01:16:27.932 --> 01:16:30.200
<i>cannibalism, gunshots,
stabbings?</i>

01:16:30.268 --> 01:16:31.901
<i>I'll slice, I'll dice,
I'll julienne.</i>

01:16:31.969 --> 01:16:34.470
<i>What about hanging...
By the testicles?</i>

01:16:34.572 --> 01:16:38.007
<i>But before we begin,
a word to the parents.</i>

01:16:38.075 --> 01:16:40.777
The following program will
contain scenes of violence

01:16:40.844 --> 01:16:42.845
not suitable for small children.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:47.817
<i>The rest of you won't take
your eyes off the screen.</i>

01:16:49.753 --> 01:16:52.989
Don't fucking move!

01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:55.858
<i>And now...</i>

01:16:56.093 --> 01:17:00.563
<i>On with the show, a death
TV special segment...</i>

01:17:00.631 --> 01:17:02.398
What floor's the studio on?

01:17:02.466 --> 01:17:03.967
38th floor.

01:17:04.034 --> 01:17:08.271
<i>Our first little contestant
comes from our city of angels.</i>

01:17:08.339 --> 01:17:09.639
<i>9 years of age...</i>

01:17:09.707 --> 01:17:11.641
No!

01:17:11.708 --> 01:17:13.309
No, no, no!

01:17:13.376 --> 01:17:16.145
<i>...and lover of macaroni
and cheese,</i>

<i>This girl will be leaving
her mark on this world by...</i>

01:17:26.857 --> 01:17:28.992
That's my little girl!

01:17:29.059 --> 01:17:31.393
Listen! As God is my witness,

01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:33.830
I'm going to find your daughter,

01:17:33.897 --> 01:17:35.798
but I need your help.

01:17:35.866 --> 01:17:40.302
We got to find out who's
in charge of the building

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:43.339
and get them to cut the phone lines.

01:17:43.406 --> 01:17:44.907
Can you do that?

01:17:44.975 --> 01:17:47.043
Go! Go! Let's move it!

01:17:47.111 --> 01:17:48.611
Inside! Go!

01:17:50.313 --> 01:17:53.049
Move it! Move it! Let's go!

01:17:54.818 --> 01:17:56.753
<i>This beauty's got two hours</i>

01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:59.889
<i>until she gets blown
into little beauty bits.</i>

01:18:00.157 --> 01:18:02.992
Madison, I'll find
your daughter for you.

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:05.194
Help me!

01:18:05.262 --> 01:18:07.196
<i>Coming to the glorious climax...</i>

01:18:07.264 --> 01:18:08.898
There's Barnes there.

01:18:08.966 --> 01:18:10.583
There!

01:18:10.651 --> 01:18:12.068
Barnes!

01:18:12.136 --> 01:18:14.003
Go!

01:18:14.071 --> 01:18:15.288
Parker!

01:18:15.356 --> 01:18:17.624
Fan out your men!

01:18:17.692 --> 01:18:19.158
Go!

01:18:28.285 --> 01:18:29.819
Go! Go! Go!

01:18:52.342 --> 01:18:54.410
Shit!

01:18:54.477 --> 01:18:58.114
So while we wait and
watch the demise

01:18:58.215 --> 01:18:59.949
of young karin Carter,

01:19:00.017 --> 01:19:02.985
let's have a talk with
our studio audience.

01:19:05.122 --> 01:19:07.757
You're the supervisor.
You can do it.

01:19:07.825 --> 01:19:10.026
I don't know if I can.

01:19:10.094 --> 01:19:12.795
Cut every phone line into
this building.

01:19:12.863 --> 01:19:16.498
<i>Imagine, if you can,</i>

01:19:16.566 --> 01:19:18.567
<i>just for a moment,</i>

01:19:18.635 --> 01:19:22.839
<i>that she is your daughter,</i>

01:19:22.906 --> 01:19:26.508
<i>a child you have
given birth to.</i>

01:19:26.576 --> 01:19:29.011
<i>Only now...</i>

01:19:29.079 --> 01:19:33.515
<i>To be completely,
utterly helpless</i>

01:19:33.583 --> 01:19:36.152
<i>and unable to save her.</i>

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:41.791
Oh, my.

01:19:41.859 --> 01:19:44.526
Where is my daughter?

01:19:44.594 --> 01:19:46.595
I don't know.

01:19:46.663 --> 01:19:49.431
And what will you do now?

01:19:49.499 --> 01:19:51.100
Shoot me?

01:19:52.069 --> 01:19:54.637
<i>Folks at home, ed.</i>

01:19:54.704 --> 01:19:56.239
<i>Ed, folks at home.</i>

01:19:58.608 --> 01:20:00.709
<i>Enjoying the show, ed?</i>

01:20:03.113 --> 01:20:06.548
<i>At moments like this,
I bet you're thinking,</i>

01:20:06.616 --> 01:20:08.517
<i>"where is God?"</i>

01:20:08.585 --> 01:20:10.519
<i>I have that same dilemma.</i>

01:20:10.788 --> 01:20:14.757
<i>Oh, look at that response,
ed. They love you.</i>

01:20:20.230 --> 01:20:23.766
<i>What I am...</i>

01:20:23.834 --> 01:20:25.768
<i>Is not my fault.</i>

01:20:25.836 --> 01:20:27.770
<i>It's not even my choice.</i>

01:20:27.838 --> 01:20:32.942
<i>I came to be because of
what you are.</i>

01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:37.013
<i>They love you so much,
they want you dead, ed.</i>

01:20:41.985 --> 01:20:43.652
<i>Face it, folks.</i>

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:48.124
<i>To kill is in your nature.</i>

01:20:51.195 --> 01:20:53.762
What the hell happened
to the phone lines?

01:20:53.831 --> 01:20:56.649
Where's my audience?
Where's my audience?

01:20:58.618 --> 01:21:00.053
Parker!

01:21:44.598 --> 01:21:48.867
<i>Put down the weapon,
or we will open fire.</i>

01:22:20.834 --> 01:22:22.868
Chief!

01:22:22.936 --> 01:22:26.239
I want that goddamn
helicopter down here now!

01:22:26.306 --> 01:22:27.673
Yes, sir.

01:22:54.067 --> 01:22:55.901
Fuck you, Parker.

01:22:55.969 --> 01:22:59.172
I am made of everything!

01:22:59.239 --> 01:23:00.406
I am the future!

01:23:00.474 --> 01:23:01.507
And you...

01:23:02.976 --> 01:23:06.011
You're losing your sense of humor.

01:23:07.347 --> 01:23:08.847
Come on!

01:23:11.635 --> 01:23:13.252
Come on, Parker! Come on!

01:23:27.201 --> 01:23:29.402
Where's the girl?

01:23:29.703 --> 01:23:32.405
It's not the same this
time, Parker.

01:23:32.472 --> 01:23:34.674
She's not your daughter.

01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:47.536
Come on, Parker!

01:23:51.891 --> 01:23:53.326
Come on!

01:23:53.393 --> 01:23:55.428
Arggh!

01:23:57.731 --> 01:23:59.365
Where's the girl?

01:23:59.433 --> 01:24:01.667
Where's the girl?

01:24:15.983 --> 01:24:17.950
Banzai!

01:24:27.761 --> 01:24:29.194
Jump, Parker!

01:24:31.097 --> 01:24:34.500
Come and get the little
girl, Parker!

01:24:34.568 --> 01:24:36.619
Arggh!

01:24:39.773 --> 01:24:41.474
Come on!

01:24:41.775 --> 01:24:43.876
Come on, yeah. Attaboy.

01:24:43.943 --> 01:24:46.044
You can do it.

01:24:58.825 --> 01:25:01.394
O.K., Parker. This one's for me.

01:26:10.396 --> 01:26:12.197
Now...

01:26:12.265 --> 01:26:14.366
Where is the girl?

01:26:20.574 --> 01:26:22.575
Where's the girl?

01:26:24.578 --> 01:26:27.012
Blow me, Parker!

01:26:57.544 --> 01:27:02.448
Parker--Parker--Parker--
Parker--Parker--

01:27:02.515 --> 01:27:07.420
park-park-park-park-park-
park-park-park-park-park--

01:27:15.529 --> 01:27:17.329
Parker!

01:27:20.133 --> 01:27:22.067
So, Mr. Barnes,

01:27:22.135 --> 01:27:23.569
by destroying SID,

01:27:23.637 --> 01:27:26.572
you've effectively
lost any chance you had

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:28.641
of finding the little girl.

01:27:30.143 --> 01:27:32.611
No!

01:27:41.387 --> 01:27:43.823
Arggh!

01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:46.291
[Sid] Yeah! You made it!

01:27:46.359 --> 01:27:48.994
Come on, Parker! Come on!

01:27:49.062 --> 01:27:51.430
Come on. You can make it.

01:27:51.498 --> 01:27:53.332
Oh, goody!

01:28:12.886 --> 01:28:15.888
Hey, Parker, this one's for me.

01:28:24.263 --> 01:28:25.731
Parker!

01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:31.403
Hey, maddy.

01:28:31.471 --> 01:28:33.539
You just missed Parker.

01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:37.209
Where is she?

01:28:38.578 --> 01:28:41.179
You can't kill me, maddy.

01:28:41.247 --> 01:28:43.482
Where is she?

01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:45.283
She's waiting, mommy.

01:28:45.351 --> 01:28:47.152
Ha ha!

01:29:00.834 --> 01:29:02.868
Show me Madison.

01:29:10.810 --> 01:29:13.211
<i>Tell me where my daughter is!</i>

01:29:13.279 --> 01:29:14.713
Do you see?

01:29:14.781 --> 01:29:17.716
Sid assumes he's still
in the real world.

01:29:17.784 --> 01:29:20.753
<i>[Sid] Come on, maddy.
Forget the kid.</i>

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:22.254
Where is she?

01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:24.690
Do you really want to know?

01:29:24.758 --> 01:29:25.824
Yes.

01:29:25.892 --> 01:29:28.761
Do you really, really want to know?

01:29:28.828 --> 01:29:31.463
Just click your heels three times.

01:29:34.935 --> 01:29:37.469
Oh, karin!

01:29:37.537 --> 01:29:40.005
Mommy's here!

01:29:40.073 --> 01:29:42.007
She's here?

01:29:42.075 --> 01:29:43.876
Yes! She is.

01:29:43.944 --> 01:29:46.078
She's been here all along.

01:29:46.145 --> 01:29:48.313
Uh-huh.

01:29:51.317 --> 01:29:52.785
You're dead.

01:29:52.852 --> 01:29:55.788
And you're back in the box.

01:29:57.356 --> 01:29:58.791
This is vr?

01:29:59.092 --> 01:30:00.525
That's right.

01:30:00.593 --> 01:30:02.194
Get us out, Billy.

01:30:02.261 --> 01:30:04.379
Get them out now.

01:30:04.381 --> 01:30:07.365
Madison first. Help me lift her out.

01:30:07.601 --> 01:30:10.869
<i>[Sid] They couldn't have
done this without you, Daryl.</i>

01:30:10.937 --> 01:30:13.105
I'll go lower Barnes.

01:30:13.172 --> 01:30:14.506
<i>[Sid] Daryl!</i>

01:30:14.574 --> 01:30:18.176
I'm back in the fucking box?

01:30:18.244 --> 01:30:22.114
Smart. That's my boy.

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:24.449
Anytime now, Billy.

01:30:24.618 --> 01:30:25.751
<i>Daryl!</i>

01:30:25.819 --> 01:30:27.052
<i>Daryl!</i>

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.386
<i>Daryl!</i>

01:30:28.454 --> 01:30:29.888
<i>Help me, Daryl!</i>

01:30:29.956 --> 01:30:33.358
<i>I'm back in the box, Daryl!
Help me!</i>

01:30:33.426 --> 01:30:34.910
<i>Daryl!</i>

01:30:35.128 --> 01:30:37.696
<i>Daryl! Why did you betray me?</i>

01:30:37.764 --> 01:30:39.698
<i>Daryl!</i>

01:30:39.766 --> 01:30:41.634
<i>Judas!</i>

01:30:41.701 --> 01:30:44.903
<i>Judas, Daryl!</i>

01:30:44.971 --> 01:30:47.139
Billy?

01:30:47.206 --> 01:30:48.440
No!

01:30:55.649 --> 01:31:00.119
<i>You're in my world now!</i>

01:31:45.699 --> 01:31:49.968
Get away from that,
or I'll kill you, too!

01:32:15.528 --> 01:32:18.030
<i>Parker!</i>

01:32:18.098 --> 01:32:21.033
<i>Get in here!</i>

01:32:21.101 --> 01:32:23.535
<i>Come on! I want to play!</i>

01:32:23.603 --> 01:32:28.340
I don't know what the two
of you think you're doing,

01:32:28.407 --> 01:32:30.843
but you
will not--

01:32:31.194 --> 01:32:33.245
<i>i want to play!</i>

01:32:33.312 --> 01:32:34.646
<i>I want to play!</i>

01:32:34.714 --> 01:32:35.981
<i>Coward!</i>

01:32:36.049 --> 01:32:38.450
<i>Parker! I want to play!</i>

01:32:38.752 --> 01:32:41.019
<i>I want to play!</i>

01:32:41.087 --> 01:32:45.323
<i>I want to play, Parker!</i>

01:32:48.461 --> 01:32:50.963
Let's go get your little girl.

01:33:00.573 --> 01:33:02.908
All right! Watch your step!

01:33:04.343 --> 01:33:07.546
Come on! All right! You're clear.

01:33:15.255 --> 01:33:16.388
Karin!

01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:18.690
Don't!

01:33:18.758 --> 01:33:20.192
It's booby-trapped.

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.461
The bomb squad's five minutes away.

01:33:22.529 --> 01:33:25.030
Well, we don't have five minutes.

01:33:25.098 --> 01:33:29.034
[Man] I'm going to the
other side of the roof!

01:33:29.102 --> 01:33:32.037
Karin!

01:33:32.105 --> 01:33:34.706
[Muffled cry]

01:33:37.576 --> 01:33:41.013
Listen, I'm going to
get you out of there.

01:33:45.418 --> 01:33:47.052
Hurry!

01:33:55.594 --> 01:33:57.362
Hurry!

01:34:02.202 --> 01:34:04.002
Hurry!

01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:06.438
[Karin crying]

01:34:12.879 --> 01:34:14.012
Hurry!

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:16.715
Hang on, sweetheart. I'm coming.

01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:19.551
Just stay right where you are.

01:34:19.853 --> 01:34:20.986
Hurry.

01:34:29.362 --> 01:34:31.029
Get me out of here.

01:34:31.097 --> 01:34:32.764
It's all right, sweetheart.

01:34:32.832 --> 01:34:35.734
We're going to get you
out of here.

01:34:35.801 --> 01:34:38.536
You're going to get me
out of here?

01:34:38.604 --> 01:34:41.539
Yes. I'm going to get you out.

01:34:41.607 --> 01:34:43.208
Be careful, Parker.

01:34:43.376 --> 01:34:44.676
Hi, mom. Hurry.

01:34:44.744 --> 01:34:47.512
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't move! Don't move!

01:34:53.202 --> 01:34:56.388
<i>Hello, Parker.
That can only be you.</i>

01:34:56.390 --> 01:35:00.225
<i>Anything you can think of,
I've already thought of,</i>

01:35:00.293 --> 01:35:02.894
<i>and I thought of it first,</i>

01:35:02.896 --> 01:35:06.899
<i>so I made this recording
in case you got clever.</i>

01:35:06.966 --> 01:35:09.401
Just stay right where you are.

01:35:09.468 --> 01:35:11.203
Don't move.

01:35:15.908 --> 01:35:18.676
He's got you sitting
on a pressure plate.

01:35:18.744 --> 01:35:20.879
Now, if you stand up...

01:35:20.947 --> 01:35:23.648
It's going to be very bad.

01:35:23.716 --> 01:35:25.850
O.K.? All right.

01:35:27.787 --> 01:35:31.223
[Madison] Be still, honey.
Don't move.

01:35:33.259 --> 01:35:35.193
It's o.K., baby.

01:35:35.261 --> 01:35:37.262
Hang in there.

01:35:43.803 --> 01:35:46.104
Don't move, honey.

01:35:46.439 --> 01:35:48.606
Mom, get me out of here.

01:35:48.674 --> 01:35:51.143
We will, baby. Just stay still.

01:35:55.014 --> 01:35:56.581
Mom. Mommy.

01:35:56.649 --> 01:35:58.083
Hold on, baby.

01:35:58.151 --> 01:36:00.585
All right. Just talk to mommy.

01:36:00.653 --> 01:36:01.987
Mamma.

01:36:03.056 --> 01:36:05.557
I'm right here, sweetie.

01:36:12.765 --> 01:36:15.700
Try to get into the
main operating system

01:36:15.768 --> 01:36:18.070
and reset the internal clock.

01:36:22.926 --> 01:36:26.244
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought
of that one, too.</i>

01:36:26.312 --> 01:36:28.146
<i>Better try again.</i>

01:36:28.481 --> 01:36:29.597
No!

01:36:29.899 --> 01:36:32.217
Oh, God!

01:36:33.586 --> 01:36:35.120
<i>Faster!</i>

01:36:39.492 --> 01:36:42.394
Hang on, baby. Everything's
going to be o.K.

01:36:42.462 --> 01:36:44.196
I love you, karin.

01:37:02.615 --> 01:37:05.984
Connect this side to the input...

01:37:13.859 --> 01:37:16.794
And this one goes to the output.

01:37:16.862 --> 01:37:18.863
Now, which one's the output?

01:37:18.931 --> 01:37:20.865
Which one's the output?

01:37:20.933 --> 01:37:23.868
Let's see.

01:37:23.936 --> 01:37:27.105
Eeny-meeny-miny-mo.

01:37:28.841 --> 01:37:30.375
Output, output, output.

01:37:30.443 --> 01:37:33.178
It might be this one right here.

01:37:33.246 --> 01:37:35.247
[Madison] Parker?

01:37:38.217 --> 01:37:40.419
Be it, please.

01:37:54.383 --> 01:37:58.570
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought
of that one, too.</i>

01:37:58.572 --> 01:38:00.638
<i>Better try again.</i>

01:38:00.706 --> 01:38:02.474
<i>Faster.</i>

01:38:02.542 --> 01:38:03.808
<i>Faster!</i>

01:38:03.876 --> 01:38:05.210
<i>Faster!</i>

01:38:07.246 --> 01:38:09.264
It's not working.

01:38:09.331 --> 01:38:10.382
God!

01:38:10.450 --> 01:38:11.716
Mommy!

01:38:13.319 --> 01:38:15.086
Mommy!

01:38:20.125 --> 01:38:24.096
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought
of that one, too.</i>

01:38:24.163 --> 01:38:26.098
<i>
Uh-uh-uh.</i>

01:38:26.165 --> 01:38:28.366
<i>I thought of that one, too.</i>

01:38:28.434 --> 01:38:30.368
It's working.

01:38:30.436 --> 01:38:31.936
[Madison] What?

01:38:32.004 --> 01:38:35.507
<i>Uh-uh-uh. I thought
of that one, too.</i>

01:38:35.575 --> 01:38:37.008
It's working.

01:38:37.076 --> 01:38:40.145
It's working? We're o.K.?

01:38:40.213 --> 01:38:41.613
We're o.K.?

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.416
Oh, my God!

01:38:44.484 --> 01:38:45.950
<i>
Uh-uh-uh...</i>

01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:49.521
Mommy!

01:38:49.589 --> 01:38:52.290
Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

01:38:52.358 --> 01:38:55.026
All right, sir. Watch it.
