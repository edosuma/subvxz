00:23.800 --> 00:26.119
I cut my arm. Look at it.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.119
- It's not healing.
- Do you mean...?

00:28.240 --> 00:29.639
I'm staying hurt.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.399
Don't you see?
The whole world becomes immortal.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.359
And I'm mortal. I don't mend.
I'm normal again.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.719
This, Captain, fascinates me.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.039
- What makes you so different?
- I don't know.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.879
And yet you're the only one left,
the only true human. So tell me,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.119
what did you give them so long ago?

00:51.240 --> 00:52.719
Why would he want you dead?

00:52.840 --> 00:56.359
On the very day that no-one's dying?
Wish I knew.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.279
Every time you turn up,
it always go wrong.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.999
Where are you from?

01:01.120 --> 01:04.679
Long ago and so far away.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.639
(HUBBUB)

01:13.440 --> 01:16.639
MAN: Harkness. Anyone?

01:16.760 --> 01:18.599
Jack Harkness.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.039
I'm looking forJack Harkness.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.719
That's me.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.959
Welcome to America, Mr Harkness.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.839
There's your visa all stamped.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.999
Grazie. I mean,
thank you very much, Inspector.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.919
Hey, wait! Stop that man!

01:42.960 --> 01:45.359
(WHISTLES PEEP)

01:45.480 --> 01:46.599
Come on now.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.399
You're not Jack Harkness.
The visa's mine.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.759
It's what?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.599
You'll find everything's in order.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.559
The British consulate arranged for my
travel through the embassy in Rome.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.039
That visa belongs to me.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.959
Yes, sir.
Terribly sorry this happened, sir.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.919
Take him away. Send him back home.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.279
- There you are.
- Thank you.

02:26.120 --> 02:29.079
You're still here.
I thought you'd be in the city by now.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.999
Time to spare.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.919
Waiting for the next boat to Manhattan.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.079
I also am waiting for a boat.
Mine goes all the way

02:36.200 --> 02:37.839
- back to Italy.
- Right.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.039
That's what they do with thieves.

02:43.080 --> 02:48.679
An interesting fact is they do it
also with people who forge visas.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.279
Good eye.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.439
- Why didn't you tell them?
- I wasn't sure.

03:00.560 --> 03:04.279
Until that moment when you said,
"Why didn't you tell them?"

03:04.400 --> 03:05.599
(CHUCKLES)

03:05.720 --> 03:08.799
I'm on a kind of unofficial
official visit,

03:08.920 --> 03:11.879
one part of the government
pretending to be another part.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.479
You work for a government?

03:14.600 --> 03:17.999
Look at me.
Do I look like a bureaucrat?

03:19.360 --> 03:21.319
Never seen a man like you before.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.119
More like a soldier.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.839
Your English is good. Where did you learn?

03:26.960 --> 03:29.599
We had a schoolmaster in the village.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.639
He taught me.

03:32.920 --> 03:37.199
I went to him every single day
because I always dreamt of coming here.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.319
- What's the village?
- You wouldn't know it.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.999
No-one ever does.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.759
Tiny place on the Amalfi Coast.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.239
And I mean, for certain,
right on the coast.

03:46.360 --> 03:50.199
The whole place is holding its breath
on the edge of a cliff top.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.359
If you look over,
hundreds of feet down to the sea.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.639
Sounds beautiful. Why'd you ever leave?

03:56.760 --> 04:01.079
New York. They have buildings here
taller than the cliff.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.479
- I wanted to see that.
- You wait.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.879
They've only just started building.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.599
Years to come, they're going to have...

04:07.720 --> 04:11.639
- What? They're going to have what?
- Never mind. What's your name?

04:11.760 --> 04:17.559
Angelo Colasanto.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.639
- La magia oscura!
- It's not magic.

04:26.760 --> 04:30.079
Technology.
Sometimes they're indistinguishable.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.479
Hey, hey, hey!

04:32.600 --> 04:34.999
How does it work? Can I see it?

04:38.320 --> 04:40.479
Hey, over here!

04:40.600 --> 04:42.599
We just found this man's papers.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.159
You can let him go.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.399
We're going to Manhattan.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.159
Who are you?

05:21.280 --> 05:23.839
What do you want?

05:24.960 --> 05:26.719
What do you want?!

05:57.440 --> 06:01.999
Vera! Vera! Vera!

06:05.960 --> 06:07.639
How many views have we got now?

06:07.760 --> 06:09.919
Um, over five million.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.199
People are setting up
memorial services for her too.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.679
Just random people
who didn't even know her.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.159
I just, um...

06:23.240 --> 06:24.399
You got the footage

06:24.520 --> 06:26.279
and that's going to make the difference.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.279
But I've been meaning to say, I...

06:28.400 --> 06:31.759
I know that that must have been...

06:33.760 --> 06:34.999
I'm sorry.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.039
I got ya.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.599
No, really, Rex.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.919
I really didn't even know her
that well, OK?

06:44.040 --> 06:45.919
- But you did. You must have talked.
- Look, she...

06:46.040 --> 06:48.919
she told me about her mother,
her ex-husband,

06:49.040 --> 06:51.599
possibly something about
a brother or a sister.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.679
I don't know, maybe not.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.679
- The obituary says...
- Yeah. But what does it matter?

06:56.800 --> 06:59.999
Hmm? Whoever she was, it's gone.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.199
- I don't even know where she's from.
- The news is saying San Antonio.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.439
Well, then, go Spurs!

07:07.160 --> 07:08.679
Sorry.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.559
I don't know how to help.

07:11.680 --> 07:15.519
Except that...maybe her death
has changed things.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.679
They'll shut down the camps.

07:17.800 --> 07:22.159
No, they "paused" the camps.
That's all they're saying. Paused.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.999
And while the politicians
are all denying everything,

07:25.120 --> 07:27.959

waiting to burn.

Sorry about your dad.

- No, not really.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.759
- Jack!
- He went outside.

- Jack?
- Hey!

- No, just stuff from back home.

Next couple of years,
earn as much as you can.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.559

Don't worry. It gets better.

Huh!

I like a lot of things.

She's beautiful.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.279
You like her too?

10:27.320 --> 10:28.599
Of course I do.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.599
What would you like to do to her?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.359
You tell me.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.399
I'd strip off her clothes.

10:49.640 --> 10:54.159
Maybe a little too quickly.
Something...might tear.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.679
Girls don't like that.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.839
She's not most girls.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.479
She's strong.

11:04.440 --> 11:05.999
She'd rip open my shirt.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.679
And what then?

11:13.360 --> 11:15.279
I'd move in close...

...so I can smell her

11:19.680 --> 11:22.239
and she can smell me.

Kiss her.

in the room.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.759
and hot.

And you're just...breathing them in.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.239

they are not looking at me,

12:54.360 --> 12:57.879
so I can move fast on my own,
faster than anyone.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.879
- Spoken like a true American.
- Really?

13:02.760 --> 13:04.519
Turn out the lights.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.679
We can talk till we fall asleep.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.919
- I thought you'd want me to go.
- No.

13:10.040 --> 13:14.319
Um...I mean, if...you want to stay.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.799
Turn out the lamp.

- You've never done this?
- No.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.279
This part, er...no.

- What happened to your eye?
- I was born with it.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.759
So...who was your first?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.799
A boy from my village.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.319
In secret.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.199
In the woods, you know?

14:08.640 --> 14:10.519
What about that schoolmaster of yours?

14:10.640 --> 14:12.319
No!

14:14.000 --> 14:15.399
What makes you say that?

14:15.520 --> 14:18.079
He was my teacher. He was my friend.

14:18.200 --> 14:21.759
OK. I was...just joking.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.359
But why?

14:23.480 --> 14:25.319
What's so funny?

14:25.440 --> 14:27.599
I don't understand.

14:29.760 --> 14:32.559
We just did something...special.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.599
Why do you make it cheap?

14:34.720 --> 14:36.719
I suppose I do sometimes.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.559
I'm sorry.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.359
Really...

14:52.760 --> 14:54.199
I'm sorry, OK?

14:57.800 --> 14:59.039
How did you know?

14:59.160 --> 15:02.359
About me, that I was like this?

15:04.200 --> 15:05.519
Just experience, that's all.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.279
So...

15:07.400 --> 15:09.679
anyone looking at me,
would they know?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.279
No.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.879
- Trust me, you're safe.
- OK.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.359
People wouldn't know
if you don't want them to know.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.199
- OK.
- OK.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.239
- OK then.
- OK.

15:20.360 --> 15:23.239
But you too, mostly.
Most of the time...

15:23.360 --> 15:26.599
keep your hands down, maybe.

15:26.720 --> 15:31.519
(LAUGHING) I really don't care
what people know.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.199
Where are you from?

15:40.320 --> 15:43.199
Italian visa, British passport.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.439
A magical island called Torchwood.

I don't know where. Just east.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.359
Did they say get on the 1 0 going east?

Or on the eastbound 1 0 Freeway,
or what?

20:52.720 --> 20:55.519

20:57.160 --> 20:58.599
it could mean that English
is not their first language.

I would have thought of it.

21:22.040 --> 21:25.599

I shouldn't even say this...

It would respond to her.
Like a tracker.

21:53.040 --> 21:56.599
We could save her together.
We could rescue her.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.199
You could do that?
You could do that recode thing?

21:59.320 --> 22:03.959
Yes. A drop of your blood. A single cell
would do, but a drop would be easier.

- Pull over.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.679

- Your friend thinks he's funny.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.159
He doesn't. He isn't. He's sorry.
This is Sal Maranzano.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.799
- You were going to undercut my price.
- We found some untapped resource.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.679
Rumour is you two are a pair of finocchi.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.759
That's not a rumour. That's a boast.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.839
And if you were really upset about
some small-time competition,

23:06.960 --> 23:08.599
it'd already be hailing bullets.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.399
So we're here for another reason.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.399
I don't think so. Take 'em, kill 'em.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.999
Give us a try, Maranzano.

23:15.120 --> 23:18.279
You need men like us, off the grid.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.359
Men who could never
be traced back to you.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.559
So whatever it is you need, Sal,
no matter how dangerous it is,

23:23.680 --> 23:25.239
no matter how strange it is,

23:25.360 --> 23:27.639

to another warehouse.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.479
You can count on us.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.079
You will not look in the box.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.479
Sure thing.

23:45.120 --> 23:49.999
You will swear...
on everything that is holy

23:50.120 --> 23:54.079
you will deliver the box,
but you will not look inside.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.479
I promise.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.199
Then we got a deal.

- No.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.199
You're packing my things!

24:27.240 --> 24:29.639
You need to go now. There's a plan.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.959
And I'm not part of your plan?

24:31.080 --> 24:33.439
Look at your hands. Not a scar on them.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.319
I'm tougher than you.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.679
Maranzano's people
have stumbled across something

24:38.800 --> 24:41.559
they're not supposed to have.
I've got to stop them.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.919
You made this happen?

24:46.480 --> 24:47.679
You've planned this.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.839
Since when?
Since you got on the boat to America?

24:50.960 --> 24:53.319
Just get out of town, Angelo.
These people are bad.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.639
You don't want to be on their list.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.479
- Get far away.
- Who are you doing this for?

24:56.600 --> 25:00.719
The government in England?
Or the other thing you said...Torchwood?

25:00.840 --> 25:02.359
For the train. Go to the West Coast.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.679
You're handsome enough.
Get into the movies.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.559
- I'm not letting you send me away.
- Why?

25:06.680 --> 25:08.119
Because you wouldn't know
how to get another man?

25:08.240 --> 25:09.719
Because you're not brave enough?

25:09.840 --> 25:11.359
You think I'm with you because it's easy?

25:11.480 --> 25:13.599
- It's not easy, trust me.
- I know.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.479
I hear the beads clicking
at night, Angelo.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.839
Everything we do,
you ask for forgiveness afterwards.

25:19.960 --> 25:22.079
That's just sex. Imagine if it was love.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.639
What would he say then, your God?
What would he say if two men could love?

25:25.760 --> 25:28.839
Oh! Oh, but no. No, that's impossible.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.839
And if it's impossible,
then you can't stay with me.

25:31.960 --> 25:32.959
You...

25:34.000 --> 25:35.079
...you're an ass.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.119
For a man who knows a lot of things,
huh, you're not so bright.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.719
Think about it.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.639
I grew up in a village with 200 people.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.039
Only 200.

25:45.160 --> 25:49.159
The sun would rise and the sun would set
over the same 200 people.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.879
And that was it. That was my world.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.519
And look at me now.

25:54.640 --> 25:59.879
I'm a bootlegger in New York City
with you in my bed.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.439
You think any of your little secrets

26:02.560 --> 26:04.519
can change my life
more than it's already changed?

26:04.640 --> 26:06.479
And yes, I...

26:06.600 --> 26:08.879
I feel guilty about what we do.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.359
It hasn't made me stop doing it.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.079
Besides, I always hoped...

26:38.760 --> 26:40.199
...if God is love,

26:40.320 --> 26:42.439
maybe...

26:42.560 --> 26:43.799
he loves me too.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.519
That's blasphemy.

26:45.640 --> 26:47.559
I think that's Christianity.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.199
You're unpacking my things?

27:12.280 --> 27:13.559
I've got this friend.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.559
He's called The Doctor.

27:17.680 --> 27:20.119
He explores the world...

27:23.000 --> 27:24.559
...with a companion.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.679
It looks nice.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.039
Are you saying that I can stay?

27:36.320 --> 27:37.639
Maybe.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.959
Oh, Dio.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.799
What's all this?

28:08.920 --> 28:11.399
Ammonia refrigeration. Of course!

28:11.520 --> 28:13.519
The best they could do in 1 927.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.719
They said, "Don't look in the box."

28:16.840 --> 28:19.279
- Yeah, right(!)
- What is it? What's inside?

28:20.680 --> 28:24.519
Someone way above Maranzano,
they found something, a weapon.

28:24.640 --> 28:27.239
They told Maranzano to hold it

28:27.360 --> 28:29.519
until after the next state election,
then ship it to Albany.

28:29.640 --> 28:33.199
Maranzano doesn't know what he's got,
but he's terrified of it.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.519
Can't say I blame him.

28:38.640 --> 28:41.439
No. No, that's...

28:41.560 --> 28:42.679
What?

28:42.800 --> 28:47.439
Er, it's a parasite. Like a bug.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.359
A parasite?

28:50.440 --> 28:51.839
Tell me more about it.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.479
Good man.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.679
It's a species of brainspawn

28:56.800 --> 29:00.599
treated as vermin on more than
1 50 planets that I know of.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.439
And valued as dinner on one other.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.239
It tastes like oysters.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.039
- You did not.
- I had to be polite.

29:10.120 --> 29:14.119
Now this part drills
into the brain of the host

29:14.240 --> 29:16.639
and deposits its larvae there...

29:16.760 --> 29:18.679
little worms,

29:18.800 --> 29:23.079
sharp as needles,
pushing into the brain very slowly.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.119
he's going to be elected governor
of New York this November.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.679
But he wouldn't start making
the really crazy decisions

29:33.800 --> 29:35.559
until his second term as president.

29:35.680 --> 29:40.719
Result - America destabilises,
pulls out of the war, Germany rises,

29:40.840 --> 29:45.079
the Third Reich triumphant, and there's
a whole new history sprawling out.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.119

These people above Maranzano.

called The Trickster's Brigade.

the very first day, but...

32:44.040 --> 32:45.519

all the horror, do you know
what is worse than all of that?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.519
I loved it.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.679
I bloody loved it.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.839
And I'd keep telling Rhys I was sorry

33:21.960 --> 33:25.719

and, oh, I felt so special.

And when we lost people,
it was so, so big

33:37.520 --> 33:42.279
and I could say it was worth it,
because the bigger it was,

33:42.400 --> 33:44.159
the more important I was.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.519
And the more people we lost...

33:47.040 --> 33:49.599
...the more that meant I was a survivor
and I was better than them.

Los Angeles, together.

43:28.240 --> 43:35.399
Jack!

43:37.680 --> 43:39.079
Where are you going?

43:39.200 --> 43:40.839
I left something here.

43:43.640 --> 43:45.519
You left something in a vent on a roof?

43:46.640 --> 43:49.359
Ha! Never go far without it.

43:56.920 --> 43:59.839
- OK, but now we go.
- I'm going, yeah.

43:59.960 --> 44:01.119
Time to move on.

44:02.960 --> 44:04.679
But not with you.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.519
I'm sorry.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.719
I was terrified, Jack.
They said you were the devil,

44:15.840 --> 44:16.999
but other people said
you were a blessing...

44:17.120 --> 44:18.759
Something happened to me once,

44:18.880 --> 44:20.799
a long way away.

44:20.920 --> 44:26.599
Time itself changed me
to a...fixed point. And now I can't die.

44:26.720 --> 44:29.479
I suffer and I perish...

44:31.040 --> 44:32.519
...but I always come back.

44:32.640 --> 44:37.319
I've lived through a lot of Earth's past
and a lot of its future.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.999
And I'll keep on
living this life for ever.

44:40.120 --> 44:42.479
- In the future, are we together?
- What does it matter?

44:42.600 --> 44:43.679
- Are we together?
- We can't be,

44:43.800 --> 44:45.639
cos one day you're going to die

44:45.760 --> 44:47.559
- and I won't.
- Then we forget the future.

44:48.760 --> 44:50.279
We make the moment now.

44:50.400 --> 44:53.359
- We make a promise and we go forward.
- Angelo,

44:53.480 --> 44:56.079
- don't.
- What? You're lonely, too.

44:56.200 --> 44:57.479
You said you want a companion.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.399
- Don't make me do this.
- You're not going without me!

44:59.520 --> 45:01.599
- Just let me go.
- But you can't!

45:01.720 --> 45:02.959
I'm never going to let you go.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.479
I could travel this whole wide world,

45:05.600 --> 45:07.999
but where would I find
another man like you?

45:08.120 --> 45:12.039
Please, don't leave me on my own.

45:15.320 --> 45:16.719
I'm sorry, Angelo,

45:16.840 --> 45:20.279
but this is the story of my life.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.519
It always ends the same way.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.959
You kill me.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.919
Men like you...

45:40.360 --> 45:42.879
- ...you kill me.
- No!

45:49.320 --> 45:51.079
No! No!

45:51.200 --> 45:53.999
No! Jack!

46:30.360 --> 46:31.639
- Know her?
- No.

46:31.760 --> 46:32.999
- OK.
- WOMAN: Thank you.

46:33.120 --> 46:37.359
You followed the instructions,
as far as I can tell.

46:37.480 --> 46:38.959
Captain Harkness,

46:39.080 --> 46:40.879
the last mortal man.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.199
It has been a long journey.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.839
- (GUNSHOT)
- What the hell?!

46:50.960 --> 46:52.279
- Find out who that is!
- It's on you.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.279
Who is it?

46:54.400 --> 46:55.559
What the hell are they doing?!

46:57.480 --> 46:58.679
(GUN COCKS)

46:58.800 --> 47:00.279
Gotcha.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.119
Bad day, Gwen?

47:02.240 --> 47:03.839
(BEEPING)

47:19.520 --> 47:21.119
- Rex.
- Yeah?

47:21.240 --> 47:23.399
Rex, you gotta see this.

47:23.520 --> 47:26.119
I was just checking the cache
on the I-5s. Look what it says.

47:26.240 --> 47:29.359
- Can we track them?
- Yes.

47:29.480 --> 47:30.839
Oh, Gwen!

47:30.960 --> 47:33.799
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

47:33.920 --> 47:35.679
Must be Rex and Esther.

47:35.800 --> 47:37.679
- She's still got Anwen.
- Not for long.

47:38.920 --> 47:41.279
Uh, you've got a little something
on you there.

47:41.400 --> 47:45.239
Now unless you want to be
diagnosed Category 1 ...

47:46.320 --> 47:47.559
Put your guns down.

47:49.960 --> 47:52.479
OK, get back! Get back! Back!

47:55.840 --> 47:57.839
- Her hands are up.
- Yes.

47:57.960 --> 48:00.079
Go, go, go!

48:01.520 --> 48:04.239
- All right, go, go, go!
- (THEY SHOUT ORDERS)

48:05.400 --> 48:07.279
Grid one! Check him out!

48:07.400 --> 48:09.599
One down. Living room clear.
Spread out, follow the grid.

48:09.720 --> 48:10.999
Yes, sir. Jackson, with me.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.799
Rhys, I can't believe it. We got you,
don't worry. You're all right.

48:14.920 --> 48:16.519
Took your bloody time!

48:16.640 --> 48:18.519
Yes, I know, Mrs Cooper.
It's been frantic.

48:18.640 --> 48:19.759
We got this call. I was off duty...

48:19.880 --> 48:21.479
Gun, gun, gun!

48:26.440 --> 48:27.879
I've never shot anyone before.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.959
Where's Gwen?

48:30.080 --> 48:33.679
Andy! What's happened to Gwen?

48:40.280 --> 48:42.239
It's OK. It's OK.
Your family and baby, they're safe.

48:43.320 --> 48:46.239
Next time, just ask for help. I'm sick
of Torchwood acting like amateur clowns.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.119
Oh, you did it! Thank you!

48:48.240 --> 48:49.679
Got it?

48:49.800 --> 48:51.639
Thank you.
And you, you're going to live.

48:51.760 --> 48:52.919
It's a talent of mine.

48:53.040 --> 48:53.959
I meant every word I said.

48:54.080 --> 48:55.039
- So did I.
- Good.

48:55.160 --> 48:56.599
And as for you...

48:56.720 --> 48:58.359
you'd better pray
that death comes back to this planet

48:58.480 --> 48:59.479
by the time I'm finished with you.

48:59.600 --> 49:02.199
So tell us who you are,
before I let her loose.

49:02.320 --> 49:05.799
I don't see that anything's changed.

49:05.920 --> 49:07.359
You're still coming with me.

49:07.480 --> 49:09.759
- Why would I do that?
- You'll want to come with me

49:09.880 --> 49:13.839
because I can take you to the one man
who knows how the miracle began.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.959
- Who's that?
- Angelo.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.999
Angelo Colasanto.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.999
He's waiting for you, Jack.

49:23.960 --> 49:26.719
He's been waiting
for such a very long time.

49:33.760 --> 49:35.359
They don't exist.

49:37.320 --> 49:38.559
- Shit!
- What is it, Rex?

49:38.680 --> 49:40.559
Everybody, stay where you are!
Back down.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.439
OK, OK, all right.

49:45.200 --> 49:47.319
- Leave me alone with him.
- (GRUNTS)

49:52.040 --> 49:54.519
- Goddamn it!
- Shit.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.879
While you were wasting time, Mr Shapiro,

49:57.000 --> 49:58.319
we've got the names of the people
who are responsible

49:58.440 --> 50:01.559
for causing the miracle.
I suggest we get to work.

50:01.680 --> 50:04.319
He's preaching hellfire and salvation,
which makes Oswald Danes

50:04.440 --> 50:05.959
the most popular man in the world
right now.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.639
Get me a girl.

50:08.760 --> 50:10.879
How old?

50:11.000 --> 50:12.559
Mr Danes?

50:12.680 --> 50:16.119
I can act all kinds of innocent.

50:16.240 --> 50:17.159
Don't presume to know me.

50:17.280 --> 50:20.439
I am capable of far more
than my...reputation.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.199
(GIGGLES)

50:22.320 --> 50:24.799
I said...don't presume.

50:26.160 --> 50:29.799
Actually, if you don't mind,
I think I'd like to go.

50:29.920 --> 50:31.999
Don't! Don't you dare!

50:33.560 --> 50:36.039
This is like the whole world
is changing...

50:37.080 --> 50:38.999
...and we're just so tiny.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.999
There's a reason why Torchwood was secret.

50:41.120 --> 50:42.919
We kept things hidden from the human race.

50:43.040 --> 50:47.919
This technology is a science
the world should never know.

50:48.040 --> 50:49.959
This thing would be the end of us.
