04:45.617 --> 04:46.866
Here. You want some whisky?

04:46.867 --> 04:48.740
Uh, no, thank you very much, sir

04:50.117 --> 04:51.859
You may call me Remi if you like.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.075
Alright, I will, sir.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.866
Me too,

05:03.867 --> 05:06.024
I was afraid of storms at tour age.

05:07.492 --> 05:08.866
Do you like to sing?

05:08.867 --> 05:11.238
- What?
- Singing. Is it something you like?

05:12.908 --> 05:14.699
It calmed me down pretty

05:15.117 --> 05:16.776
well on nights like this one.

05:19.783 --> 05:21.443
What did you used to sing?

05:22.908 --> 05:24.283
A nursery rhyme.

05:26.867 --> 05:28.242
My nursery rhyme.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.608
Way back then,

05:33.242 --> 05:35.529
I really knew nothing about its origin.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.565
It was as if I'd always had it in my head.

05:44.367 --> 05:46.574
In Chabanon, where I lived,

05:46.575 --> 05:50.741
I was always humming it,
over and over again,

05:50.742 --> 05:53.445
to my gentle and patient Roussette.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.530
Time to go, Roussette, before it rains.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.616
On stormy nights like this one,

06:10.617 --> 06:11.991
my mother

06:11.992 --> 06:13.741
Mama Barberin

06:13.742 --> 06:15.824
always had me sing it to her,

06:15.825 --> 06:17.074
and as a result

06:17.075 --> 06:20.406
I'd wind up forgetting everything around me

06:22.617 --> 06:26.991
As for my father,
who'd gone years before to work in Paris

06:28.867 --> 06:32.824
the only thing
I knew about him was through the letters

06:32.825 --> 06:34.574
he sent to my mother

06:34.575 --> 06:36.366
with certain colleagues

06:38.533 --> 06:39.907
Unfortunately,

06:39.908 --> 06:42.407
- one day a letter came...
- Mama!

06:42.408 --> 06:45.741
That announced there'd been
a terrible accident on the worksite.

06:45.742 --> 06:47.282
Dear one

06:47.283 --> 06:51.574
In writing you, it come to me that I'll probably
never again be able to work as a stonecutter.

06:52.825 --> 06:56.657
Nonetheless, I am sure that
I'll obtain a handsome indemnity.

06:56.658 --> 06:59.990
But for my defence,
mylawyer requires four hundred francs.

07:00.825 --> 07:02.824
According to my reckoning,

07:02.825 --> 07:06.239
our savings should allow us to meet his demand.

07:06.783 --> 07:08.324
Send me the money quickly, sweetheart.

07:08.325 --> 07:10.815
And pray ourlawsuit is successful.

07:21.450 --> 07:24.484
And it's only because we're neighbors
that I'm buying her at this price.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.360
Only those who have lived
n the country among the peasants

07:31.992 --> 07:35.199
know how much distress and pain

07:35.200 --> 07:37.491
are in these three words:

07:37.492 --> 07:39.151
sell the cow.

07:43.742 --> 07:48.234
For me, Roussette wasn't only our wetnurse,

07:48.867 --> 07:51.241
she was my friend,

07:51.242 --> 07:52.617
my best friend,

07:54.158 --> 07:55.617
my only friend.

08:04.283 --> 08:05.949
After that,

08:05.950 --> 08:08.116
not a single night went by,

08:08.117 --> 08:10.192
that I didn't pay her a visit.

08:13.658 --> 08:18.649
I can't even count how many whips
I stole from our neighbor during that period.

08:29.367 --> 08:31.657
Easy now girl, don't worry,

08:31.658 --> 08:32.821
it's just me.

09:39.367 --> 09:40.825
Who's there?

09:52.700 --> 09:53.731
Mama!

09:55.742 --> 09:58.238
Mama!

09:58.950 --> 10:00.407
I saw a man! A giant man!

10:00.408 --> 10:03.949
- I was in the barn with Rousette, he wanted to catch me!
- Calm down! Calm down! Calm down now Remi!

10:03.950 --> 10:05.408
What's the problem here?

10:17.617 --> 10:18.731
Jerome,

10:20.825 --> 10:21.856
This is Remi

10:24.992 --> 10:28.109
- Remi I want you to meet...
- My father

10:30.950 --> 10:32.278
He's still here?

10:32.617 --> 10:34.359
Jerome

10:48.117 --> 10:51.234
I'm beginning to see why
we didn't have enough money to pay my lawyer.

10:52.492 --> 10:55.325
- Mama? Mama?
- Don't you call her that!

10:56.033 --> 10:58.523
She's no more your mother
than I'm your father!

11:01.575 --> 11:03.532
How could you do this to me?

11:03.533 --> 11:05.532
Keep him all this time without telling me?

11:05.533 --> 11:07.699
Spend all our money on him?

11:07.700 --> 11:11.991
But I never hid anything from you!
You told me to keep him,

11:11.992 --> 11:14.366
until his parents come looking.
I even kept his blanket so they would recognize him.

11:14.367 --> 11:16.032
Little idiot!

11:16.033 --> 11:18.241
It never crossed your mind after all
these years they'd never come back for him?

11:18.242 --> 11:21.866
What would you have had me do?
Should I have abandonned him too? In an orphanage?

11:21.867 --> 11:25.324
It would've been simpler then than it would be now!

11:25.325 --> 11:28.449
I'll never let you take him from me, you hear?
I'll never let you take him from me!

11:28.450 --> 11:31.032
Because you think we have a choice?

11:31.033 --> 11:33.865
How do you figure on feeding him
when we don't have enough money for us?

11:33.867 --> 11:34.991
No!

11:34.992 --> 11:36.866
You've got no right! You can't do that!

11:36.867 --> 11:39.782
- We've got no choice.
- I won't let you, d'you hear?

11:56.450 --> 11:57.695
My baby-

12:00.533 --> 12:01.861
I'm sorry.

12:04.783 --> 12:06.157
Forgive me please!

12:06.158 --> 12:10.324
That night, after consoling me
my mother told me the story.

12:10.325 --> 12:13.443
It happened ten years ago,
one morning in February.

12:14.783 --> 12:17.818
That day, Jerome was
on his way to work in Paris, when-

12:18.450 --> 12:19.695
Unh Watch where you're going!

12:39.783 --> 12:41.656
When he noticed yourluxurious clothes,

12:42.075 --> 12:45.407
Jerome decided to bring you to me,
instead of to the orphange,

12:45.408 --> 12:48.028
hoping that some day
your rich parents would look for you.

12:49.700 --> 12:53.032
Hello, baby. Hello, baby. Hello, baby.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.693
Don't become too attached.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.653
We'll have to return him one day.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.445
I named you Remi.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.398
Remi.

13:06.242 --> 13:08.032
Like the child we'd lost.

13:10.533 --> 13:11.778
Remi Here.

13:12.908 --> 13:14.283
These things are yours.

13:15.325 --> 13:16.653
This belongs to you.

13:18.242 --> 13:19.273
Look.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.574
I don't want to go to the orphanage, Mama.

13:31.575 --> 13:33.449
Don't let him take me please.

13:33.450 --> 13:34.574
Mama, please!

13:34.575 --> 13:36.241
Don't you worry, dear.

13:36.242 --> 13:37.819
I won't let him do that.

14:01.367 --> 14:02.280
Boo hoo hoo Forgive me.

14:03.658 --> 14:04.986
Forgive me. Boo hoo

14:48.033 --> 14:50.819
Remi. Remi.

14:51.242 --> 14:53.861
Wake up now, sweetheart.
I have something to tell you.

14:56.158 --> 14:57.907
We thought this over all night,

14:57.908 --> 14:59.491
and and we thought that

14:59.492 --> 15:01.866
maybe we might get money from the city

15:01.867 --> 15:03.942
for the whole time you've been here.

15:07.825 --> 15:10.324
And what if the mayor refuses?

15:10.325 --> 15:12.400
Like to see him try,
there are laws in this country!

15:15.742 --> 15:16.856
Thank you, Mama.

15:47.075 --> 15:50.824
Because if the city doesn't pay enough,
we could sell them to have more money.

15:50.825 --> 15:54.991
And with all that money

15:54.992 --> 15:58.241
we might be able to buy back Roussette.

15:58.242 --> 16:00.945
Her new master beats her,
even though she's always been good.

16:02.700 --> 16:03.863
Aren't we going in?

16:06.575 --> 16:07.903
We're not stopping at the town hall.

16:09.158 --> 16:10.533
Why? Where we going?

16:12.825 --> 16:13.856
You know perfectly well.

16:14.367 --> 16:15.742
You're going to the orphanage.

16:17.408 --> 16:19.898
- But but but you said that we'd get money from the-
- Shut up!

16:24.700 --> 16:26.443
I said that so my wife'd let you go with me.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.573
At the town hall,
they don't care about people like us.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.491
All we have left is in my wallet.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.741
That's why we can't keep you.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.741
You're hurting me.

16:35.742 --> 16:38.657
- Enough! I'm taking you there now!
- No!

16:38.658 --> 16:39.986
Ow! Hnh Y'little brat, you!

16:40.950 --> 16:43.653
Remi! Remi!

16:44.283 --> 16:45.398
Catch him someone!

16:47.492 --> 16:48.654
Don't let him go!

17:01.450 --> 17:02.824
What the-
What d'you think you're doing, you?

17:02.825 --> 17:05.195
Don't let him get away!
Open up! Open up!

17:09.075 --> 17:10.106
Outta my way!

17:31.450 --> 17:35.397
What frightful crime did this child commit
to deserve the wrath of an entire village?

17:37.908 --> 17:40.114
Hh with all due respect, sir,
it is none of your business.

17:45.950 --> 17:48.866
This kid is a foundling,
who refuses to be brought to the orphanage.

17:49.158 --> 17:50.617
Watch yourself, boy!

17:50.825 --> 17:52.900
You wouldn't want my friend here
to grab your ankle.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.236
The orphanage, that it?

17:57.283 --> 17:59.986
Come sit at my table and tell me your story.

18:26.658 --> 18:32.075
Bring us one more pitcher please.

18:32.700 --> 18:33.731
But

18:34.367 --> 18:37.074
did it ever cross your mind that
he might make you some money?

18:37.075 --> 18:38.241
Come again?

18:38.242 --> 18:39.486
Uh... real money?

18:41.033 --> 18:42.282
How so?

18:42.283 --> 18:43.528
How much?

18:46.575 --> 18:47.690
Thirty francs.

18:50.408 --> 18:51.574
Uh I don't follow.

18:51.575 --> 18:54.782
It's quite simple:
I propose to rent this boy

18:54.783 --> 18:59.572
for one year to begin, and if he proves satisfying,
I'll keep him longer.

19:01.450 --> 19:05.824
So what do you say? Thirty francs.
I think my offer is reasonable. Well?

19:07.908 --> 19:09.568
Well, sir, I, uhh

19:12.492 --> 19:13.949
What is your name, anyway?

19:13.950 --> 19:18.032
Vitalis Master Vitalis!
Artist of the byways and trainer of animals

19:18.033 --> 19:19.906
You've made the acquaintace of Capi,

19:19.950 --> 19:23.198
and the mischievous scoundrel
there is called Lovelyheart.

19:23.242 --> 19:28.324
We tour the country to earn our living and
as you can see, we're sufficiently well-off

19:28.325 --> 19:29.574
but I was thinking that

19:29.575 --> 19:31.946
a child like this one, pale and undernourished,

19:32.033 --> 19:36.656
might be just what we need to provoke pity
in the public when we pass the hat.

19:39.158 --> 19:40.190
See your point.

19:41.867 --> 19:43.242
But sixty francs a year.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.366
Thirty-five.

19:46.367 --> 19:47.699
Fifty-five.

19:47.700 --> 19:51.149
- Too bad.
- Oh no! No no!

19:51.658 --> 19:52.903
Y'got a deal. Right.

20:51.033 --> 20:52.196
Keep Moving.

21:11.575 --> 21:12.606
Mama.

21:17.825 --> 21:18.940
Mama.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.907
Mama! Mama!

21:27.908 --> 21:29.157
Remi!

21:29.158 --> 21:33.032
Mama! Let me go! Mama-a-a-a!

21:33.033 --> 21:38.449
- Remi!
- Mama-a-a-a! Let me go!

21:38.450 --> 21:40.116
Please, sir, please!

21:40.117 --> 21:42.824
- Remi
- Mama-a-a-a!

21:42.825 --> 21:44.907
Remi! Unh Remi!

21:44.908 --> 21:49.069
- Mama-a-a-a!
- Come on!

21:52.408 --> 21:53.449
Let me go!

21:53.450 --> 22:03.856
Remiiiii

22:25.200 --> 22:27.616
She told me to come here to listen.

22:27.617 --> 22:29.158
I am not the one, it's her!

22:29.992 --> 22:32.282
She had a fine idea.

22:32.283 --> 22:34.074
Come in then and join the two of us.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.575
Dry your tears.

22:37.617 --> 22:38.866
There, that's better.

22:38.867 --> 22:41.237
Were you ever able to escape after that?

22:41.992 --> 22:44.695
In daylight, that would've been difficult.

22:45.617 --> 22:47.282
On the other hand,

22:47.283 --> 22:50.401
the very first time we stopped at nightfall...

23:37.283 --> 23:39.699
The first rule for a wandering performer

23:39.700 --> 23:41.157
is to never

23:41.158 --> 23:43.532
never venture into the woods

23:43.533 --> 23:45.525
after night has fallen.

23:46.992 --> 23:51.780
Stop cringing, I'm not going to hit you.

23:53.325 --> 23:54.984
You don't understand what I've done?

23:55.950 --> 23:58.522
I didn't bring you with me to cause you pain.

23:59.492 --> 24:02.407
If not for me,
tonight you'd be at the orphanage.

24:03.325 --> 24:04.158
Come one,

24:04.159 --> 24:05.533
come lie down.

24:06.242 --> 24:07.191
Get some rest.

25:01.575 --> 25:04.065
Here we'll find clothes befitting your new life.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.445
You're not happy with them?

25:32.283 --> 25:33.657
I am.

25:33.658 --> 25:34.907
It's just that... people will stare

25:34.908 --> 25:36.236
Of course people will stare at you!

25:36.992 --> 25:39.279
Yes, sir.

25:50.117 --> 25:51.776
The bill's ten francs.

26:09.700 --> 26:10.949
Master

26:10.950 --> 26:13.657
Why are you spending so much money on me?

26:13.658 --> 26:15.117
I beg your pardon?

26:16.242 --> 26:18.324
I, uh...

26:18.325 --> 26:21.657
You gave those three silver coins
to the Barberins yesterday,

26:21.658 --> 26:23.946
and then again today at the cobbler's.

26:25.325 --> 26:29.699
It's obvious Mister Lovelyheart
is unhappy just eating stale bread.

26:29.783 --> 26:33.232
That means that you don't have as
much money as you said you did to Barbarin.

26:33.867 --> 26:35.111
I admit it.

26:35.533 --> 26:38.449
I don't earn my living as well
as I pretended to.

26:38.742 --> 26:40.949
And it's true that

26:40.950 --> 26:43.653
I used almost all of the savings
the troupe has for you

26:45.533 --> 26:47.193
but if I did do that

26:47.825 --> 26:50.528
it's because I knew you would be precious.

26:51.450 --> 26:54.781
I heard you singing the other night in the barn.

26:54.992 --> 26:58.026
A pure heart and a pretty voice
are rarely found together.

27:01.367 --> 27:04.698
I didn't want to hire you from Barbarin
to pass the hat.

27:07.283 --> 27:09.690
I hired you because I want you to sing!

27:13.658 --> 27:16.361
To sing? You mean, in front of a crowd?

27:17.825 --> 27:19.074
But they'll make fun of me!

27:19.075 --> 27:23.650
If you prove as generous with them as
with your cow, they're going to love you!

27:36.658 --> 27:37.824
Captain Capi,

27:37.825 --> 27:39.283
Mister Lovelyheart...

27:39.992 --> 27:41.236
Hold this for me.

27:45.533 --> 27:46.992
Master Vitalis

27:55.742 --> 27:58.949
Now your job is to observe, and to listen,

27:58.950 --> 28:02.613
and to do whatever I tell you at
the exact moment I tell you to do it. Let's go!

28:22.408 --> 28:23.736
And we're off!

28:41.992 --> 28:43.865
Hello, ladies!

28:44.575 --> 28:45.820
Good day, gentlemen!

28:50.117 --> 28:52.282
Follow me, children, follow me!

28:52.283 --> 28:54.489
Follow the music!

28:59.700 --> 29:03.860
Step right up, ladies! Step right up, gentlemen!
Come closer, kids, c'mon!

29:04.908 --> 29:07.907
Open up your ears, widen your eyes,

29:07.908 --> 29:10.741
and then prepare both hands for applause,

29:10.742 --> 29:13.657
cause the spectacular show we'll present

29:13.658 --> 29:16.241
is known to be the most extraordinary
n France,

29:16.242 --> 29:18.032
no, not in France,

29:18.033 --> 29:20.108
in Europe and its surroundings!

29:21.158 --> 29:25.532
What is that?
You don't believe what I say?

29:32.908 --> 29:35.407
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
we shall demonstrate

29:35.408 --> 29:39.782
for this young buffoon just

29:39.783 --> 29:44.074
what magnificent performers we are!

29:44.075 --> 29:45.734
Oh, this is no time to be timid, Capi!

29:49.283 --> 29:50.611
Don't be timid!
You should greet our friends!

29:50.950 --> 29:51.981
Captain Capi, you're on!

29:54.158 --> 29:56.150
Bravo, Captain!

29:56.992 --> 29:58.241
And you, General!

29:58.242 --> 30:00.317
Let's go, Captain! Turn! Ho ho!

30:02.408 --> 30:04.991
And turn! Keep turning,
in the other direction!

30:04.992 --> 30:05.950
Oh, Captain, you're making my head spin!

30:05.951 --> 30:10.324
Ah, at last! Watch it! There's an obstacle.
Let's give him a hand! A big hand!

30:10.325 --> 30:11.570
A bow now! Bravo, Captain!

30:14.158 --> 30:17.282
What's that? We have a painful paw?

30:17.283 --> 30:18.315
C'mon then.

30:22.492 --> 30:24.782
Goodness! It's clear
we're not going to get far like this!

30:24.783 --> 30:29.157
So, since he's been hurt,
we'll have to put him down. Bang!

30:29.575 --> 30:32.199
Oh, right, that was a very bad decision.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.732
Reassure our friends, Captain,
and rise up with energy!

30:39.367 --> 30:41.782
And now, the crowning moment of our show.

30:41.783 --> 30:44.983
Careful, ladies and gentlemen,
step back, give us room!

30:48.950 --> 30:49.899
Take your place! Ally oop!

30:50.742 --> 30:52.283
And Bravo! Ally oop! And Ally oop! Whoa! Yes!

30:53.533 --> 30:55.821
Bravo!

31:04.367 --> 31:05.824
Bravo! Here now, here!

31:05.825 --> 31:08.030
Good dog, you did well.

31:11.575 --> 31:13.531
Now take your bow.

31:14.158 --> 31:16.366
All join in and thank the dog!

31:16.367 --> 31:17.907
Bravo! Bravo!

31:17.908 --> 31:22.407
Thank you all! Thank you. Thanks very
much, dear audience. Most appreciated.

31:22.408 --> 31:25.616
To conclude our show today,

31:25.617 --> 31:27.074
it is my privilege to present something gentle,

31:27.075 --> 31:31.157
the voice of an angel which
will melt the hardest of hearts.

31:31.158 --> 31:34.907
It's the premier of this young prodigy

31:34.908 --> 31:37.694
and so I would ask you to encourage
him with thunderous applause!

31:57.617 --> 31:59.774
- What am I supposed to do?
- Sing, of course!

32:22.617 --> 32:25.320
Oh well, for a first time,
that's quite a success, huh?

32:37.700 --> 32:39.282
What the-? What're you doing?

32:39.283 --> 32:41.866
I'm returning your presents!
I told you I wouldn't be able to!

32:41.867 --> 32:43.866
But you had stage fright,
that's normal at the beginning.

32:43.867 --> 32:45.616
- You'll see, next time you'll
- And there won't be any next time!

32:45.617 --> 32:48.324
I'll never sing again, you hear me?
Never again!

32:48.325 --> 32:51.366
You really think I'm going
to let your fear waste your talent?

32:51.367 --> 32:53.657
How can you tell if I have any talent?

32:53.658 --> 32:55.816
You're nothing but a dog trainer!

32:56.450 --> 32:59.991
I know enough to be able torecognize
a gift when I come upon it!

32:59.992 --> 33:01.449
You'll sing, whether you want to or not!

33:01.450 --> 33:02.699
You won't be able to force me!
You said before you never beat a boy!

33:02.700 --> 33:04.699
If you force me it means you'll be a liar!

33:04.700 --> 33:06.657
Very well! In that case, I'm going
to bring you personally to the orphanage!

33:06.658 --> 33:11.992
I mean, really!

33:19.283 --> 33:21.156
Anyway, what difference does it make?

34:19.074 --> 34:20.320
That's you, isn't it?

34:21.658 --> 34:23.235
You were a violinist?

34:23.449 --> 34:25.109
I was more than that. Read on.

34:28.742 --> 34:30.614
You never learned to read, huh?

34:33.324 --> 34:35.116
It is written there:

34:35.117 --> 34:39.574
Yesterday the celebrated violinist

34:39.574 --> 34:42.065
left Vienna,

34:43.658 --> 34:46.157
accompanied by his wife and his son,
for Venice,

34:46.158 --> 34:50.407
where he will play before Italy's highest society.

34:50.408 --> 34:53.949
That's right, boy, long before
I was just a tamer of dogs and monkeys,

34:53.949 --> 34:55.616
my talent as a musician
was particularlyacknowledged.

34:55.617 --> 34:57.616
Which is why I feel qualified today

34:57.617 --> 35:01.777
to recognize a greatvoice! One like yours.

35:06.158 --> 35:07.072
What is this?

35:07.700 --> 35:10.824
The first letter of the alphabet is the letter A.

35:10.825 --> 35:12.282
There are twenty-five others.

35:12.283 --> 35:14.282
If you work and learn to know the letters
and to assemble them correctly,

35:14.283 --> 35:17.407
you'll be able to write your mother.

35:17.408 --> 35:22.407
You might even be able to include
in your letters a part of our earnings.

35:22.408 --> 35:24.157
In exchange,

35:24.158 --> 35:27.491
I want you to work hard on your singing,

35:27.492 --> 35:31.024
so that you're able to sing,
when I ask you to perform.

35:40.825 --> 35:42.616
A B

35:42.617 --> 35:45.532
C C B

35:46.658 --> 35:47.903

35:48.742 --> 35:49.773
Wait for me!

35:50.617 --> 35:51.991

35:51.992 --> 35:53.866

35:53.867 --> 35:54.991

36:29.492 --> 36:30.820
Mmmmma-a-y

36:31.367 --> 36:33.323
- Ma
- Ma Ma!

36:35.533 --> 36:37.282
Mama, my dear Mama Barberin

36:37.283 --> 36:39.282
My dear Mama Barberin

36:39.283 --> 36:41.574
I hope that you are happy now,

36:41.575 --> 36:45.735
in spite of the distress I saw you in
when you saw me leaving you.

36:45.825 --> 36:50.532
Now that I know how to write,
I will send you as many letters as I can.

36:50.533 --> 36:52.824
Barberin rented me to a good master,
is a good master.

36:52.825 --> 36:54.282
A very good master,
who never beats me

36:54.283 --> 36:58.527
and who always shares his bread with me
and the animals in the troupe.

36:59.783 --> 37:01.449
Above all

37:01.450 --> 37:03.449
he is teaching me to sing

37:03.450 --> 37:08.239
and he even says that if I learn to sing
in front of people, then I will make money.

37:09.367 --> 37:10.741
Alf I am able to,
I will send you as much money s I can,

37:10.742 --> 37:14.487
so you can buy Roussette back.

37:24.783 --> 37:27.901
I send you all my love,
my dearr Mama Barberin.

37:28.242 --> 37:29.486
Yours, Remi.

37:38.450 --> 37:40.616
Da-duh Here's your nursery rhyme.

37:40.617 --> 37:44.366
These little notes contain
what you are in the deepest part of you.

37:44.367 --> 37:46.986
Always keep this manuscript close to your heart.

38:11.867 --> 38:13.116
Master?

38:13.117 --> 38:14.279
Master-

39:04.700 --> 39:05.945
Master?

39:09.908 --> 39:12.282
You were shouting last night.

39:12.283 --> 39:13.860
Enzo and Angelina.

39:16.575 --> 39:18.946
Were those the names of your wife
and your child?

39:22.492 --> 39:24.898
Is it 'cause of them you finished playing violin?

39:26.575 --> 39:29.278
That you're no longer the man
the papers write about?

39:32.700 --> 39:33.649
Rxcuse me, master.

39:34.283 --> 39:36.866
- I didn't mean to pry.
- No, no.

39:36.867 --> 39:38.325
You're right to ask about it.

39:39.575 --> 39:41.567
The problem is sometimes

39:42.825 --> 39:45.196
certain names awaken old sorrows.

39:47.075 --> 39:48.533
I won't mention it anymore.

39:51.658 --> 39:52.821
Anyway

39:54.283 --> 39:55.943
what have you got to show me?

39:56.867 --> 39:58.444
Your last exercise!

39:59.575 --> 40:02.065
- What are we doing, Master
- No no no, just trust me!

40:05.325 --> 40:07.613
Here we go,

40:07.825 --> 40:10.397
Now that you understand technique,
you must rediscover how to sing with your heart.

40:14.783 --> 40:16.656
Inhale this perfume.

40:22.408 --> 40:23.950
Chavanon!

40:24.367 --> 40:26.026
That-That's the smell of Chavanon!

40:26.992 --> 40:28.023
Sing.

42:13.242 --> 42:15.616
My master hadn't lied to me.

42:15.617 --> 42:18.657
I loved singing. Intensely.

42:18.658 --> 42:22.199
And I already knew that
I would never stop singing.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.449
The fullness,

42:23.450 --> 42:24.491
the freedom,

42:24.492 --> 42:26.866
the-the sharing...

42:26.867 --> 42:31.655
I knew at that instant that
nothing would ever make me give it up.

42:41.450 --> 42:43.032
When summer came,

42:43.033 --> 42:46.032
our troupe sought out generous audiences

42:46.033 --> 42:48.741
particularly the English aristocracy,

42:48.742 --> 42:51.776
who seemed to have plenty
of money to spend.

42:57.908 --> 43:01.032
Come on! Well done, Mister Lovelyheart:

43:01.033 --> 43:02.074
You fine?

43:02.075 --> 43:03.320
Get down now.

43:07.075 --> 43:10.323
Children! The kites are ready for you.

43:24.992 --> 43:26.657
Remi,

43:26.658 --> 43:28.449
give me a hand, will you?

43:42.908 --> 43:44.991
It's frustrating, isn't it?

43:44.992 --> 43:46.991
Seeing them have fun

43:46.992 --> 43:50.738
and not be able to join them even
it is my birthday today.

43:51.242 --> 43:52.617
Why don't you go play with them?

44:03.867 --> 44:07.482
Errr, excuse me,
I didn't notice that you were handicapped.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.366
No.

44:16.367 --> 44:18.109
I'm sorry, I didn't mean Forgive me,
it was stupid to say that.

44:21.158 --> 44:23.233
If you could've seen the look you had!

44:23.950 --> 44:25.116
I don't find it so funny.

44:25.117 --> 44:26.990
It is pretty funny, admit it.

44:29.908 --> 44:31.574
Let them play, please.

44:31.575 --> 44:34.147
I'm afraid I don't often see my daughter laugh.

44:36.450 --> 44:40.532
And anyway, even if I could walk,
I wouldn't go play with them.

44:40.533 --> 44:42.282
They are so boring!

44:42.283 --> 44:45.616
I was I believe it the happiest of little boys.

44:45.617 --> 44:48.657
- What was wrong with her?
- A rare disease

44:48.658 --> 44:52.282
called coxalgia, that caused such suffering

44:52.283 --> 44:56.032
that she could barely move
let alone walk.

44:56.033 --> 44:57.610
My name is Lise.

45:00.533 --> 45:01.778
My name is Remi.

45:04.908 --> 45:07.824
- And did you see her afterwards?
- I did.

45:07.825 --> 45:11.241
But not in the circumstances I had hoped for.

45:11.242 --> 45:14.282
Because, while being itinerant artists

45:14.283 --> 45:17.199
provided us with some delightful encounters,

45:17.200 --> 45:21.029
it also involved others,
that were far more painful.

45:21.992 --> 45:26.574
Bravo! Well done! Bravo!
Good dog! Well done, Capi!

45:26.575 --> 45:27.405
Stop that!

45:28.450 --> 45:29.907
My master

45:29.908 --> 45:33.032
had already warned me
about certain spoilsports

45:33.033 --> 45:34.991
who thought that street performers
were nothing

45:34.992 --> 45:39.157
but miserable beggars who stole the money

45:39.158 --> 45:40.532
of honest citizens with their foolishness.

45:40.533 --> 45:41.778
Gentlemen?

45:43.658 --> 45:45.324
Your authorization if you please?

45:45.325 --> 45:47.282
Our, uh, authorization?

45:47.283 --> 45:51.032
The authorization from the city
which permits you to perform in this town,

45:51.033 --> 45:53.866
and to perform with animals
wearing neither leash, nor muzzle.

45:53.867 --> 45:57.074
Well, my goodness,
I didn't realize we needed one.

45:57.075 --> 45:59.699
Are you certain that
we really require an authorization?

45:59.700 --> 46:02.824
- Are you questioning my judgment?
- No no no, why of course not!

46:02.825 --> 46:05.532
But it's just that
I put on shows here each year,

46:05.533 --> 46:08.241
and it's the first time
I've heard of an an authorization.

46:08.242 --> 46:09.574
So you confess to this infraction?

46:09.575 --> 46:11.366
Yes, yes, but only because I was unaware,
uh, And of course to prove my good will,

46:11.367 --> 46:16.157
I'll go this very afternoon to the proper office

46:16.158 --> 46:18.324
Very well.

46:18.325 --> 46:21.657
For now, I have to write you a summons
and place your animals in the pound.

46:21.658 --> 46:22.907
Silence!

46:22.908 --> 46:25.407
But Officer, I've just told you
that I was ignorant of the law

46:25.408 --> 46:27.824
That's no reason to violate it!
Take the animals!

46:27.825 --> 46:29.366
But Sir, there must be some other way.

46:29.367 --> 46:31.866
I assure you my dog wouldn't hurt a fly!

46:31.867 --> 46:34.574
- What are you waiting for?
- I don't want to feed my finger to that mutt.

46:34.575 --> 46:36.157
Capi, please!

46:36.158 --> 46:38.657
Wait! Officer, please! Officer!

46:38.658 --> 46:40.318
We didn't do anything! Stop!

46:47.700 --> 46:48.649
Stop that!

46:53.742 --> 46:55.319
No!

46:56.783 --> 46:57.907
Remi!

46:57.908 --> 46:59.283
Run!

46:59.700 --> 47:00.945
Get away!

47:11.450 --> 47:13.032
I place you under arrest.

47:13.033 --> 47:14.148
Take him away!

47:33.783 --> 47:36.901
I wonder if Jules Verne actually went
to all the places he writes about.

47:37.158 --> 47:39.197
I'd really be surprised
if he went that deep under water.

47:44.492 --> 47:48.032
Having heard many witnesses testify
to the defendant's innocence

47:48.033 --> 47:50.616
the court declares Master Vitalis

47:50.617 --> 47:53.651
not guilty of the charge
of disturbing the peace.

47:56.658 --> 48:03.320
However, to be fully informed,
we had to investigate your record.

48:03.492 --> 48:06.782
And we were somewhat surprised to discover

48:06.783 --> 48:10.316
that all the information regarding
your identity is false.

48:11.158 --> 48:14.491
The Court would like
to be lenient with you, Sir,

48:14.492 --> 48:19.446
on the condition that you state your
true name and that your record is spotless.

48:26.658 --> 48:30.107
- Why didn't you tell them the truth?
- It was absolutely impossible.

48:30.408 --> 48:32.491
No one must ever know. Ever.

48:32.492 --> 48:35.199
Because of who? Enzo and Angelina?

48:35.200 --> 48:37.903
Why is it no one can ever,
talk about them with you?

48:48.742 --> 48:50.200
Because I killed them. I, uh...

48:56.033 --> 49:00.116
At the time
I wasn't the man you know today,

49:00.117 --> 49:03.448
I was an egoist. Selfish. Full of myself.

49:05.325 --> 49:07.907
My family bored me.

49:07.908 --> 49:12.069
I preferred high society,
where people knew how to flatter me.

49:14.075 --> 49:18.319
Every evening,
in spite of my indifference towards him

49:19.367 --> 49:23.657
My poor Enzo never failed to light a candle
to help me make my way in our living room

49:29.700 --> 49:31.573
No one knows what actually happened.

49:34.783 --> 49:36.574
Could've been a draft, a...

49:40.200 --> 49:42.606
maybe the candle fell onto the carpet...

49:48.450 --> 49:50.737
I did everything I was able to,
to save them,

49:51.783 --> 49:54.699
but the fire had already consumed my house.

50:02.825 --> 50:05.113
I buried my son when he was ten.

50:06.450 --> 50:10.943
At the cemetary, his nanny sang
his favorite children's song,

50:13.033 --> 50:14.776
a nursery rhyme that I,

50:15.533 --> 50:20.736
the most famous musician in all of Italy,
I'd never heard before.

50:22.492 --> 50:23.736
Oh, of course,

50:24.158 --> 50:26.861
everyone pretended to be sympathetic,

50:27.283 --> 50:30.117
but no one doubted it was my fault.

50:31.867 --> 50:34.700
You might have thought that
my career was finished,

50:35.325 --> 50:36.239
but, no,

50:38.658 --> 50:42.407
on the contrary,

50:42.408 --> 50:45.949
Tickets sold out immediately, as soon as
people heard that I was returning to the stage.

50:45.950 --> 50:50.525
Audiences went mad, they absolutely wanted
to be there to witness my rebirth

50:52.075 --> 50:53.024
It's then it's then

50:55.408 --> 50:57.281
I decided that

50:58.117 --> 50:59.694
it was over,

51:00.408 --> 51:01.985
that I'd end it all,

51:03.033 --> 51:05.736
never again would I play the violin.

51:09.700 --> 51:11.158
The life I live today

51:11.658 --> 51:13.449
is my penance

51:13.450 --> 51:15.737
for not being able to save them.

51:20.825 --> 51:23.113
I will be here when you get out.

51:43.117 --> 51:44.148
How long?

51:44.700 --> 51:46.157
Two months.

51:46.158 --> 51:47.190
Ah, the louts!

52:10.200 --> 52:11.445
Remi, you asleep?

52:16.658 --> 52:18.864
- What're you doing here?
- I missed you.

52:24.492 --> 52:27.195
You seem to be comfortable here.

52:29.075 --> 52:30.617
You shouldn't be here.

52:30.950 --> 52:33.741
And y'know it's dangerous to go wandering alone

52:33.742 --> 52:35.319
on a barge with nobody.

52:40.533 --> 52:41.992
Why do you have this baby blanket?

52:42.617 --> 52:44.490
Don't touch that!

52:51.158 --> 52:52.190
I'm sorry.

52:55.325 --> 52:57.897
I I was wearing it
when they found me as a baby.

52:58.867 --> 53:03.324
I had never told anybody about my story.

53:03.325 --> 53:04.984
Not even my master.

53:06.158 --> 53:09.491
But I had never realized

53:09.492 --> 53:11.649
how much I really needed to share it.

53:13.450 --> 53:17.610
That's the way the most glorious
summer of my young life began.

53:23.867 --> 53:25.532
Look at this one!

53:25.533 --> 53:27.407
- That one there!
- Right.

53:27.408 --> 53:29.483
Looks like a unicorn!

53:48.033 --> 53:49.361
Good night, Lise.

53:50.617 --> 53:52.407
You too, Remi.

53:52.408 --> 53:54.782
- Master Zacharius
- AND Master

53:54.783 --> 53:56.366
AND Master Zacharius,

53:56.367 --> 54:01.241
who seemed almost dead, rose from his bed

54:01.242 --> 54:02.617
What does he want?

54:07.283 --> 54:09.489
C'mere! Here, boy!

54:10.742 --> 54:11.856
Master!

54:17.492 --> 54:18.523
Master!

54:45.325 --> 54:47.068
I would like Remi to stay with us.

54:50.742 --> 54:52.907
Remi has completely transformed Lise.

54:52.908 --> 54:54.485
You've noticed the bond they have?

54:56.158 --> 54:58.648
My poor girl's about to undergo
a delicate operation.

54:59.492 --> 55:02.823
She'd greatly profit from his presence during
her convalecence, which will be difficult.

55:03.450 --> 55:04.364
After that?

55:05.117 --> 55:06.241
After that?

55:06.242 --> 55:08.657
After the convalescence of your daughter.

55:08.658 --> 55:12.199
Frankly I was thinking Remi might stay with us.

55:12.200 --> 55:16.858
If he liked, he would receive an education
that would permit him to become her personal butler.

55:22.825 --> 55:25.324
- What about his singing?
- Singing?

55:25.325 --> 55:26.782
His singing.

55:26.783 --> 55:29.782
Remi possesses the talent
and a passion for the art.

55:29.783 --> 55:32.074
To be sure, Master Vitalis, but

55:32.075 --> 55:33.450
be serious.

55:38.450 --> 55:40.116
Ah, Madam, it's true that the

55:40.117 --> 55:44.366
the life that you promise is certainly
comfortable and farless risky

55:44.367 --> 55:46.986
than what I can offer.

55:49.158 --> 55:50.321
However,

55:50.825 --> 55:54.073
you don't seem to realize
the grandeur of this child.

55:54.158 --> 55:59.366
You give the boy the opportunity to climb
the ladder of servitude in your family.

55:59.367 --> 56:03.949
The life he has with me is rugged,
but it forges his character.

56:03.950 --> 56:09.907
And even if the route that leads
to your world appears difficult,

56:09.908 --> 56:13.449
the grandeur that I see in him permits
me to believe that one day

56:13.450 --> 56:14.782
he'll be able to enter through the front door,

56:14.783 --> 56:19.358
Now you're proposing at best that
he become the valet of your daughter,

56:20.408 --> 56:24.154
and I want if he'd like to, to one day be able

56:25.117 --> 56:27.820
to give him the possibility to ask you
for her hand with pride.

56:29.908 --> 56:33.949
You seem very aware of our world,
Master Vitalis.

56:33.950 --> 56:37.282
So we won't surprised
if I say I find you unreasonably optimisitic.

56:37.283 --> 56:40.117
I am indeed whenever I hear him sing.

56:44.992 --> 56:46.449
But it'll be his choice

56:46.450 --> 56:49.907
Whether he stays with you or comes with me,
the choice is up to him.

56:49.908 --> 56:51.866
- He's a child.
- Oh, yes, that he is

56:51.867 --> 56:55.944
But he's a child who has
experienced more than many adults.

57:16.575 --> 57:18.234
Will you come see me?

57:20.533 --> 57:21.992
I promise.

58:01.783 --> 58:03.028
Oh no.

58:29.075 --> 58:30.403
Good night, Lise.

58:31.367 --> 58:32.825
Good night, Remi.

58:38.117 --> 58:42.407
I could see that our master
was less and less hardy.

58:42.408 --> 58:47.616
He was so weak that one day
we couldn't even reach the destination

58:47.617 --> 58:50.948
that we had decided that
very morning to reach.

58:56.242 --> 58:58.731
Master! You hurt?

59:23.950 --> 59:26.653
Lovelyheart! Lovelyheart! Come back!

01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:02.695
To the cabin, quickly! Run!

01:00:06.325 --> 01:00:07.283
Capi! Run!

01:00:07.284 --> 01:00:10.615
Capi!

01:00:16.033 --> 01:00:18.523
Master! Master, hurry! Capi, come!
Capi! Here, Capi! Hurry,

01:00:22.617 --> 01:00:26.363
They're coming! They're coming!
Quick! Capi! Come back!

01:00:27.492 --> 01:00:29.282
- Capi! Master
- Master, hurry!

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:30.950
Capi!

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.658
Capi!

01:00:35.325 --> 01:00:38.866
- Come in now! No Capi-i-i!
- Capi!

01:00:38.867 --> 01:00:42.198
- Come in! Get in!
- Capi!

01:00:43.533 --> 01:00:45.821
Capi, no! Capi-i-i-i Capi no!

01:00:51.242 --> 01:00:53.648
Capi, quick! C'mon, boy, come on! Come on, boy!

01:01:09.492 --> 01:01:12.407
Lovelyheart!

01:01:13.325 --> 01:01:14.487
There!

01:01:46.242 --> 01:01:47.824
Lise, sweetheart?

01:01:47.825 --> 01:01:50.610
Why don't you help me
on this wrap for your little cousin?

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:04.992
But that's the same wrap as Remi's!

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:08.109
I'm afraid you're mistaken, dear.

01:02:08.742 --> 01:02:11.866
This is a model from one of the most
famous designers in London. I quite sure Remi-

01:02:11.867 --> 01:02:14.570
- I..
- But Remi was adopted.

01:02:14.992 --> 01:02:16.569
Adopted?

01:02:17.408 --> 01:02:18.736
What do you mean?

01:02:45.117 --> 01:02:46.658
The best room you have, please.

01:03:10.325 --> 01:03:13.866
From the little I know of animal health,
I would say he's suffering from pneumonia.

01:03:13.867 --> 01:03:16.439
Keep him warm and hope for the best.

01:03:22.908 --> 01:03:26.032
- How long have you been coughing?
- It's nothing.

01:03:26.033 --> 01:03:28.116
Let me examine you.
I won't ask for any more money.

01:03:28.117 --> 01:03:29.990
I know what I have. It's really nothing.

01:03:31.033 --> 01:03:32.196
Doctor, please.

01:03:39.908 --> 01:03:41.241
Goodbye.

01:03:41.242 --> 01:03:42.700
Since when have you been sick?

01:03:43.242 --> 01:03:45.317
- A few weeks.
- Are you already coughing blood?

01:03:46.658 --> 01:03:49.776
You know the prognosis
if you don't get treatment rapidly.

01:03:50.742 --> 01:03:52.615
- Yes.
- Very well.

01:03:53.658 --> 01:03:56.449
If you change your mind,
don't hesitate to call me back.

01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:58.949
- I appreciate it.
- I'm serious, please do.

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:01.574
Tuberculosis kills quickly if it's not treated.

01:04:01.575 --> 01:04:03.234
Goodbye.

01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:16.239
How are we going to pay for the room?
We don't even have enough for bread.

01:04:16.992 --> 01:04:19.157
I'll request that
the innkeeper organize a performance.

01:04:19.158 --> 01:04:23.032
But that's impossible. Just look at us.
What kind of show could we do?

01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:27.491
No need to worry.
This evening I'll perform myself.

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:34.075
Good evening, my friend. How's the family?

01:04:38.325 --> 01:04:41.573
Take your seats please,

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.282
take your seats.

01:04:44.283 --> 01:04:47.074
A very special performance this evening
which should prove exceptional,

01:04:47.075 --> 01:04:51.032
as our establishment is hosting an artist
whose fame is global

01:04:51.033 --> 01:04:54.281
who's accepted our proposition to play
for us tonight? In just a few moments, we'll be ready.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:58.525
Very good. The house is full enough
to expect forty francs in the hat.

01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:59.783
Forty francs?

01:04:59.784 --> 01:05:02.273
It's the price of the room for the week.

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.988
But we've never made more than twenty francs.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.075
You're far too sick.

01:05:41.367 --> 01:05:42.695
Have faith in me.

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:31.573
We only got twenty-six francs.

01:08:32.617 --> 01:08:33.533
But

01:08:33.533 --> 01:08:36.866
- the bowl was full.
- Full of small change, Master.

01:08:36.867 --> 01:08:40.741
How will we ever save Lovelyheart,
f we don't have enough to pay for the room?

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:44.902
Please excuse me.

01:08:45.617 --> 01:08:48.023
I simply wanted to say
how beautiful I found your work.

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:51.229
It's very kind of you to say so, Madam.

01:09:00.533 --> 01:09:04.782
- Perhaps, uh, I might offer
- No.

01:09:04.783 --> 01:09:06.242
Forgive me, it's just that

01:09:07.283 --> 01:09:09.156
You understand, I am also a musician...

01:09:11.158 --> 01:09:14.073
And I rememberwhat made me
want to pursue that vocation

01:09:15.533 --> 01:09:17.276
I was just a small girl

01:09:17.908 --> 01:09:19.283
and on that night

01:09:20.325 --> 01:09:24.272
the great Carlo Balzani triumphed
at Milan's La Scala.

01:09:26.033 --> 01:09:29.068
If you only knew how moved
I was by that concert...

01:09:30.742 --> 01:09:32.899
I never thought I would feel that way again

01:09:34.367 --> 01:09:35.529
until this evening.

01:09:37.825 --> 01:09:39.153
I'm sorry.

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:40.819
I am not that man.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.273
I am just a humble musician, who knows
a few techniques that might entertain a crowd.

01:09:51.575 --> 01:09:52.606
In that case,

01:09:53.033 --> 01:09:54.575
excuse my interruption.

01:10:01.783 --> 01:10:03.443
If you had been that man

01:10:05.325 --> 01:10:07.482
I would have wanted to express my sympathy

01:10:08.325 --> 01:10:10.198
for the loss

01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:13.657
that you suffered as well as my respect

01:10:13.658 --> 01:10:16.230
for the silence you chose
to assume afterwards.

01:10:25.742 --> 01:10:28.445
Arrivederci gentile Signore

01:10:47.075 --> 01:10:48.241
A Louis d'or!

01:10:48.242 --> 01:10:49.783
She gave us a golden coin!

01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:52.824
We'll be able to pass the winter in our room.

01:10:52.825 --> 01:10:55.196
Lovelyheart is saved! C'mon Copi, let's go!

01:10:59.992 --> 01:11:02.197
Lovelyheart, look! A golden coin!

01:11:08.742 --> 01:11:10.117
Master?

01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:12.825
Come on, Capi. Let's go!

01:12:16.033 --> 01:12:17.408
Now breathe as deeply as you can.

01:12:24.158 --> 01:12:26.031
Right, you may put your shirt on.

01:12:37.075 --> 01:12:38.741
Hey, boy!

01:12:38.742 --> 01:12:40.401
You got a letter this morning.

01:12:40.825 --> 01:12:41.774
Thank you.

01:12:48.242 --> 01:12:49.356
Lise.

01:12:50.117 --> 01:12:51.859
I am hospitalizing you today!

01:12:52.283 --> 01:12:53.446
No.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.657
You've played around with this enough,
Master Vitalis.

01:12:56.658 --> 01:12:59.990
Even if you feel strong enough to fight it,
the pneumonia's been festering far too long.

01:13:00.533 --> 01:13:02.616
It is my duty as a physician to tell you that

01:13:02.617 --> 01:13:05.199
if you don't accept a serious treatment,
immediately,

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.405
I can't guarantee that I can cure you later.

01:13:28.533 --> 01:13:30.608
What am I going to do with you both now?

01:13:32.283 --> 01:13:35.117
What am I going to do with you?

01:13:42.408 --> 01:13:43.950
Remi, we have to talk.

01:13:46.367 --> 01:13:47.611
What happened?

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.074
Dear Remi,

01:13:54.075 --> 01:13:57.491
I can't tell you the joy
I feltwhen I received your letter,

01:13:57.492 --> 01:14:00.407
not just because you gave me your news,

01:14:00.408 --> 01:14:02.365
but especially because I was desperately afraid

01:14:02.408 --> 01:14:06.154
I wouldn't have your address
to announce to you what I have to say:

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:09.075
My mother and I seem
to have found your parents.

01:14:11.242 --> 01:14:13.648
- Remi was adopted.
- Adopted?

01:14:14.908 --> 01:14:17.616
- What are you trying to say?
- That the Barberins are not his real parents.

01:14:17.617 --> 01:14:22.074
They found him in France when he was just a baby.
He was wearing exactly the same blanket.

01:14:22.075 --> 01:14:26.366
I know because he even let me see it
The labels were even torn out of the lining.

01:14:26.367 --> 01:14:29.070
So Remi could never have known
who his real parents were.

01:14:30.825 --> 01:14:37.907
And my mother saw right away that if the blanket
came originally from London, maybe you did too!

01:14:37.908 --> 01:14:42.069
My mother told your story to all of her friends,

01:14:44.367 --> 01:14:49.574
and just a few weeks later, a barrister,
James Milligan, wrote to us about you,

01:14:49.575 --> 01:14:53.237
and asked us to contact him
when you got in touch with us.

01:14:54.492 --> 01:14:55.824
My parents!

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.070
My real parents!

01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:02.609
What can I say, my boy?

01:15:03.742 --> 01:15:04.773
We go!

01:15:05.117 --> 01:15:07.074
Thank you! Thank you, Master!

01:15:07.075 --> 01:15:08.450
Capi, c'mon!

01:15:09.575 --> 01:15:11.234
We're going to see my parents, Capi!

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:26.238
May I look at it? Please?

01:15:41.867 --> 01:15:44.273
Sorry about the presence of these two policemen.

01:15:45.325 --> 01:15:48.866
Attempts at fraud have not been unknown

01:15:48.867 --> 01:15:51.984
ever since the disappearance
of the Baby Driscoll.

01:15:53.325 --> 01:15:54.488
Driscoll?

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:04.487
So than!

01:16:06.242 --> 01:16:07.404
You seem to be the one.

01:16:09.492 --> 01:16:10.523
Yes.

01:16:16.575 --> 01:16:19.991
Sir? Driscoll. Is it the name of my father?

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:23.241
Not only of your father, but also your mother

01:16:23.242 --> 01:16:25.616
and your brother and grandfather.

01:16:25.617 --> 01:16:29.907
And I've represented the family
since your disappearance.

01:16:30.617 --> 01:16:32.822
Do you feel ready to meet them?

01:17:53.242 --> 01:17:55.616
Oh Paul! Oh my God, Paul!

01:17:55.617 --> 01:17:56.861
Remi.

01:17:57.492 --> 01:17:59.366
His name is Remi, he'd prefer that.

01:17:59.367 --> 01:18:01.773
Of course, of course boo-hoo

01:18:02.825 --> 01:18:04.574
And now

01:18:04.575 --> 01:18:06.567
come kiss your father, my boy!

01:18:14.492 --> 01:18:16.365
Ohhh Paul!

01:18:25.325 --> 01:18:28.028
That woman was head
over heels in love with me.

01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:30.406
She was persuaded that we were going to marry.

01:18:31.658 --> 01:18:35.191
She couldn't bring herself to imagine
that I loved another woman

01:18:35.617 --> 01:18:37.276
your beautiful mother.

01:18:39.783 --> 01:18:42.407
When my darling wife and I had a baby,

01:18:42.408 --> 01:18:45.824
she saw an opportunity for revenge,
to punish the two of us.

01:18:45.825 --> 01:18:49.991
My fathertold the tale of my kidnapping,

01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:55.616
the story of a jealous, hate-filled woman,

01:18:55.617 --> 01:18:57.491
who, in order to wreak revenge
because he had not married her,

01:18:57.492 --> 01:18:59.699
stole me when I was six months old.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:03.449
Naturally,
we had people verifying every clue possible,

01:19:03.450 --> 01:19:09.282
however, our search didn't extend to France,

01:19:09.283 --> 01:19:12.697
since no one could imagine
she'd have taken you so far from us.

01:19:16.158 --> 01:19:18.866
You mentioned a woman, uh,

01:19:18.867 --> 01:19:20.242
but uh Jerome Barberin testified that he had seen

01:19:20.283 --> 01:19:23.282
a man leaving the scene exactly
when he found the baby.

01:19:25.325 --> 01:19:27.407
Perhaps she had an accomplice.

01:19:27.408 --> 01:19:30.526
Who knows if we'll ever find out. Alas!

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:32.816
Indeed.

01:19:35.325 --> 01:19:36.867
I understand that you're afraid.

01:19:36.992 --> 01:19:38.741
You don't know us, and you probably
can't understand all that we adults are saying,

01:19:38.742 --> 01:19:41.866
But the most important thing is that

01:19:41.867 --> 01:19:47.070
you come back to your family. No?

01:19:57.283 --> 01:19:59.074
Yes. I suppose.

01:20:05.533 --> 01:20:06.778
You'll sleep here.

01:20:08.117 --> 01:20:11.157
Since we didn't expect you

01:20:11.158 --> 01:20:13.657
we haven't yet had time
to prepare the kind of room

01:20:13.658 --> 01:20:15.615
that you would deserve.

01:20:28.867 --> 01:20:30.111
You alright?

01:20:31.367 --> 01:20:32.067
Yes.

01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:36.237
It's... it's nice here.

01:20:38.117 --> 01:20:40.404
I... I won't be leaving London right away... uh

01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:42.695
I won't be far.

01:20:46.867 --> 01:20:47.697
No!

01:20:49.158 --> 01:20:51.992
I know that you're very sick.
I saw your handkerchief.

01:20:52.492 --> 01:20:54.981
You have to go back and
see the doctor from the inn.

01:21:17.825 --> 01:21:22.199
Ah? Don't forget what I told you about
your nursery rhyme. It represents your true identity.

01:21:25.617 --> 01:21:26.992
I'll keep it forever.

01:21:28.742 --> 01:21:30.319
I promise.

01:21:51.033 --> 01:21:52.408
Goodbye, Master Vitalis.

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:56.857
Thank you for bringing the boy back to us,
in good health.

01:22:19.492 --> 01:22:20.523
Leave him.

01:24:14.992 --> 01:24:16.983
What are you up to there?

01:24:22.492 --> 01:24:25.741
Ay yi yi my bad little Peter

01:24:25.742 --> 01:24:29.902
I'm afraid that you've found our treasure chest.

01:24:29.992 --> 01:24:31.366
Peter?

01:24:31.367 --> 01:24:32.695
Before you said Peul!

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:41.856
Ahhhh Bi-i-i-I! Bi-i-i-il Bi-i-i-il

01:24:47.617 --> 01:24:50.189
Mister Milligan!
The Driscolls are not my real parents!

01:24:51.242 --> 01:24:53.317
Of course they're not your parents.

01:24:54.075 --> 01:24:57.691
Let me go! Let me go!

01:25:00.408 --> 01:25:03.241
Good.
This should take less time than we thought.

01:25:03.242 --> 01:25:04.273
Very good sir.

01:25:09.575 --> 01:25:13.440
Now you'd just better shut up
or I'll give you a hiding you won't forget!

01:25:14.908 --> 01:25:15.822
You!

01:25:16.783 --> 01:25:19.782
You boy, you hh you made me
hh run like ah hahhh Ko hhh

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:25.407
- Kill him now.
- What?

01:25:25.408 --> 01:25:27.614
Well kill him! That was the plan, wasn't it?

01:25:29.908 --> 01:25:33.026
Knock him out with this beforehand,
if it makes you feel better.

01:25:37.492 --> 01:25:38.654
Do it!

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.149
No-o-o! Capi!

01:25:53.742 --> 01:25:54.907
My baby!

01:25:54.908 --> 01:25:56.236
Do something!

01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:02.616
Silence!

01:26:02.617 --> 01:26:04.574
Who are you?
Why d'you want to kill this boy?

01:26:04.575 --> 01:26:08.449
Now just calm down! Just be calm.
It's the lawyer who's responsible!

01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:10.324
- Milligan?
- That's right.

01:26:10.325 --> 01:26:12.407
It's him who's the boy's real family,
he's the uncle.

01:26:12.408 --> 01:26:15.407
It's all about an inheritance.

01:26:15.408 --> 01:26:19.074
When the kid's real father died,
Milligan should've gotten everything.

01:26:19.075 --> 01:26:20.199
The trouble was...

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:24.699
The trouble was the wife of the deceased
was expecting a child.

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:25.614
Yeah.

01:26:26.783 --> 01:26:28.526
It's you the true heir to the fortune.

01:26:29.908 --> 01:26:34.483
When he was born, his uncle came to see me.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.491
It's always me
they come to if someone wants to

01:26:37.492 --> 01:26:40.116
to take care of somebody.

01:26:40.117 --> 01:26:42.274
I was supposed to smother him while he slept

01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:48.656
so people would think it was a natural death.

01:26:50.408 --> 01:26:53.449
At the last minute,

01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:54.565
I just couldn't do it.

01:26:56.158 --> 01:26:59.282
I can make an adult disappear with no problem.
But a little boy...

01:26:59.283 --> 01:27:00.824
Whatever I felt, though,
the job still had to be accomplished.

01:27:00.825 --> 01:27:02.907
That's why I preferred to take him
as far away as I could,

01:27:02.908 --> 01:27:04.991
and made sure
I cut the labels from his swaddling,

01:27:04.992 --> 01:27:06.865
so no one would ever know
where he'd come from. Unh

01:27:10.117 --> 01:27:11.231
Watch where you're going!

01:27:12.617 --> 01:27:14.282
And this lady,

01:27:14.283 --> 01:27:17.199
Mrs. Milligan where'll I find her?

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.074
Oh no!

01:27:19.075 --> 01:27:21.866
There's no way that
I will say a word about-hmmm

01:27:21.867 --> 01:27:23.029
Capi?

01:27:23.867 --> 01:27:24.783
Bi-i-i!!!

01:27:24.784 --> 01:27:27.699
At Milligan Park, near Barnet Village.

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:31.241
It's barely two hours from London
by the northern road.

01:27:31.242 --> 01:27:32.404
Remi!

01:27:34.575 --> 01:27:35.950
We're going to leave now.

01:27:37.825 --> 01:27:41.991
Capi will release your boy when we're far away.

01:27:41.992 --> 01:27:43.651
Have you heard me?

01:27:51.658 --> 01:27:53.733
Capi, c'mon! Here!

01:27:58.117 --> 01:28:01.366
He-elp! He-e-e-lp! HELP!

01:28:01.367 --> 01:28:06.025
Mister Milligan, help! Mister Milligan! Help!

01:28:09.783 --> 01:28:11.775
- Where do we go from here?
- To find your mother.

01:28:18.242 --> 01:28:20.731
Kof kof Come on! Keep pushing!
We'll be there soon! Kof kof

01:28:21.658 --> 01:28:23.657
It's impossible...

01:28:23.658 --> 01:28:25.616
It's snowing too hard!

01:28:25.617 --> 01:28:27.199
Trust me, Remi.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.400
I've already already been in blizzards like this.

01:28:31.867 --> 01:28:33.657
But not sick as you are.

01:28:35.825 --> 01:28:38.030
C'mon, Remi! Keep going!

01:28:52.825 --> 01:28:56.241
Master! We can't! We won't make it.

01:28:56.242 --> 01:28:58.233
I promise you we will make it.

01:29:18.742 --> 01:29:19.904
Remi!

01:29:20.533 --> 01:29:22.282
Remi, wake up

01:29:22.283 --> 01:29:23.860
Remi, wake up!

01:29:27.075 --> 01:29:29.282
You'll be alright.

01:29:29.283 --> 01:29:30.398
It'll be alright.

01:30:02.075 --> 01:30:04.363
Remi, we've almost got you home.

01:30:39.283 --> 01:30:42.401
No. No. NO! NO! NO! No

01:30:48.033 --> 01:30:49.492
Did Did we Did we arrive?

01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:53.324
Yes Remi.

01:30:53.325 --> 01:30:54.984
Yes, we've arrived. We made it.

01:30:59.908 --> 01:31:03.032
- You feel how warm it is now?
- Yes.

01:31:03.033 --> 01:31:04.575
It's the fireplace.

01:31:05.533 --> 01:31:08.532
In just a moment the fire will be even fiercer

01:31:08.533 --> 01:31:11.023
and you'll be even warmer.

01:31:19.908 --> 01:31:21.450
Come here, boy, c'mon.

01:31:29.075 --> 01:31:30.617
Farewell, my friend.

01:31:34.367 --> 01:31:36.241
Is is Capi leaving?

01:31:36.242 --> 01:31:39.490
Ah, don't you worry about it, he'll be back.

01:31:43.033 --> 01:31:45.321
You know what would make me happy?

01:31:46.575 --> 01:31:48.532
That you sing me your song.

01:31:48.533 --> 01:31:51.157
You don't have to sing it very loudly.

01:31:51.158 --> 01:31:53.529
It's just so I can hear your voice.

01:31:53.742 --> 01:31:55.200
You'll do that for me, huh?

01:33:12.075 --> 01:33:13.652
Thank you, my son.

01:34:15.742 --> 01:34:17.817
Master, Someone's out there.

01:34:19.283 --> 01:34:20.315
Master?

01:34:21.867 --> 01:34:22.816
Master?

01:34:23.742 --> 01:34:27.404
Master? Master!

01:34:28.117 --> 01:34:29.575
Master!

01:34:30.742 --> 01:34:31.856
Ma-a-a-a-aster!

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:33.862
Ma-a-aster!

01:34:34.283 --> 01:34:35.943
Uh ha ha Master? Master.

01:35:00.325 --> 01:35:01.570
Don't.

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.156
Gently. Gently.

01:35:09.283 --> 01:35:10.197
Capi.

01:35:16.450 --> 01:35:19.899
And-And my master?

01:35:21.158 --> 01:35:22.818
I am so sorry, my boy.

01:35:36.367 --> 01:35:39.491
Let him rest. Make sure he has everything he needs.

01:35:39.492 --> 01:35:41.365
Very well, Mrs. Milligan.

01:35:51.867 --> 01:35:53.029
Is he awake?

01:35:55.533 --> 01:35:58.949
- Yes.
- Good. Then he can come with me now.

01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:59.981
No.

01:36:01.242 --> 01:36:06.032
My dear, you don't seem to understand that
this little urchin and his master tried to deceive you.

01:36:06.033 --> 01:36:08.241
Yes, I understand that.

01:36:08.242 --> 01:36:11.449
But he is nonetheless an exhausted
child who just lost a loved one.

01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:15.196
Oh, you are too forgiving of these criminals
who play with your grief!

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:20.532
Why does this upset you so much?

01:36:20.533 --> 01:36:23.241
It isn't as if it's the first time this
has happened.

01:36:23.242 --> 01:36:27.616
Since it is my duty to look after you,
no one should get this close to you.

01:36:28.742 --> 01:36:30.949
Well don't worry yourself.

01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:33.449
He'll follow you as soon as he's back on his feet.

01:36:33.450 --> 01:36:34.364
Good.

01:36:36.033 --> 01:36:38.867
Do not make me wait too long, Mary.

01:36:53.325 --> 01:36:57.699
It would be better to burn these
and get this child new clothes.

01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.948
No, Lucy.
I think he'll appreciate finding his old clothes.

01:37:02.075 --> 01:37:03.741
What's this?

01:37:03.742 --> 01:37:08.116
He had it in his shirt.
It must be important to him.

01:37:16.575 --> 01:37:17.606
Madam?

01:37:19.367 --> 01:37:22.616
Madam? Is everything alright?

01:37:22.617 --> 01:37:23.861
Madam? Madam?

01:37:30.325 --> 01:37:32.815
Good morning, sir.

01:37:33.117 --> 01:37:34.776
How are you feeling today?

01:37:36.158 --> 01:37:37.901
Better. I'm better.

01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:44.572
In that case, Madam would
appreciate having a word with you.

01:37:46.867 --> 01:37:48.242
Yes, of course.

01:38:31.158 --> 01:38:33.730
It was my son's room

01:38:35.325 --> 01:38:37.400
The one he should have had.

01:38:39.908 --> 01:38:44.152
Every year I uh reorganize it,
get new furniture, I redecorate.

01:38:46.242 --> 01:38:49.490
I try to imagine what toys he would like.

01:38:51.033 --> 01:38:54.365
What tale of adventure
he would like me to read.

01:39:01.450 --> 01:39:04.899
This is where I saw him for the last time.

01:39:07.825 --> 01:39:09.900
It'll be eleven years come springtime.

01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:18.031
I can still remember how I rocked him
to sleep with a cradle song

01:39:18.742 --> 01:39:20.319
that I learned from my mother.

01:39:22.908 --> 01:39:27.282
And that I thought until today
I was the only one to remember.

01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:37.825
My little boy,

01:39:41.158 --> 01:39:42.486
my son!

01:39:51.575 --> 01:39:53.863
And that's how I found my mother,

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:55.815
my family,

01:39:56.242 --> 01:39:57.191
my rank Ha

01:40:00.825 --> 01:40:03.112
I hope that your uncle got what he deserved.

01:40:04.992 --> 01:40:06.023
In fact,

01:40:06.992 --> 01:40:09.282
he spent a good long time in prison,

01:40:09.283 --> 01:40:12.401
then was banished from England.

01:40:17.283 --> 01:40:19.157
As for my master,

01:40:19.158 --> 01:40:23.032
I respected his wishes and
had him buried under the name

01:40:23.033 --> 01:40:25.191
he chose as a wandering artist,

01:40:26.367 --> 01:40:28.109
the one who saved me

01:40:29.283 --> 01:40:31.240
in every possible manner.

01:40:33.117 --> 01:40:34.491
Since then,

01:40:34.492 --> 01:40:36.032
every single day

01:40:36.033 --> 01:40:39.151
I go to his grave to remind him

01:40:41.158 --> 01:40:43.949
What about Mrs. Barberin,
did you have her come over?

01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:46.241
No, Betty.

01:40:46.242 --> 01:40:48.241
But I did propose it to her.

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:50.532
However she preferred to stay there in Chavanon.

01:40:50.533 --> 01:40:52.821
- Remi!
- Mama!

01:40:54.075 --> 01:40:55.106
Remi! My baby! I missed you so much!

01:41:03.033 --> 01:41:04.991
And when her husband died,

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:06.569
she came here to live

01:41:07.825 --> 01:41:10.610
to help greet our very first boarders.

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:13.862
That's right.

01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:21.573
I think that now it's time to go to bed.

01:41:33.325 --> 01:41:36.657
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night, Mister Milligan.

01:41:36.658 --> 01:41:46.235
Good night, Mister Milligan

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.028
Good night, Lise.

01:43:06.867 --> 01:43:08.242
Good night, Remi.
