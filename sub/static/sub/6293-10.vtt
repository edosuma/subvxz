HELP ME UNDERSTAND GIMME?

HOLDS ALL YOUR RAW EMOTIONS.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.589
IT'S GIMME'S JOB TO KEEP
THE TRUTH FROM COMING TO LIGHT.

SUCH A STRONG, SUPPORTIVE KID.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.260
I'M REALLY LUCKY.

A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.473
I THINK I'M GONNA WAIT
THREE DATES

00:39.507 --> 00:40.774
BEFORE I LET A GUY DO ME.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.611

WAS THAT INAPPROPRIATE?

KATE'S GENERAL MANAGER.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.123
I BROUGHT
SOME BEEF BROTH FOR KATE.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.624
>> SHE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.159
>> SHE'S PROBABLY
AT THE DOCTOR OR SOMETHING.

>> GO AHEAD, LUTHER,
HURT ME GOOD, BABY!

01:01.895 --> 01:04.598

[exhales]

02:17.838 --> 02:19.440
BUT I DON'T REGRET IT...

02:19.473 --> 02:21.575
BECAUSE IT'LL ALWAYS
REMIND ME OF KATE.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.776
AND IT DIDN'T HURT
NEARLY AS MUCH

02:22.810 --> 02:24.945
AS PUSHING ALL 8 POUNDS,
7 OUNCES OF HER

02:24.978 --> 02:27.581

OH!

02:45.333 --> 02:47.301
I WASN'T THERE...

02:47.335 --> 02:49.637
BUT I COULD ACTUALLY HEAR
WHAT T WAS HEARING

02:49.670 --> 02:52.673
BEFORE I TRANSITIONED.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.508

03:18.299 --> 03:21.935
BUT THE FEELING IS...

03:21.969 --> 03:24.872
INCREDIBLE.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.840
WHEN THE HOST AND THE ALTER

03:26.874 --> 03:29.643
SHARE THE SAME EXPERIENCE
SIMULTANEOUSLY,

03:29.677 --> 03:31.512
IT'S CALLED CO-CONSCIOUSNESS.

03:31.545 --> 03:35.483
THIS IS QUITE
A BREAKTHROUGH, TARA.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.751
>> SO CAN I EXPECT THIS
TO HAPPEN MORE OFTEN?

03:37.785 --> 03:39.453
>> IF YOU CONTINUE
TO WORK SO HARD

03:39.487 --> 03:41.522
AND MAKE SUCH PROGRESS.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.890
>> [laughing]

03:42.923 --> 03:46.560
>> NOW, I WANT TO DISCUSS
SOMETHING ELSE.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.662
GIVEN WHERE YOU ARE
IN YOUR TREATMENT, TARA,

03:48.696 --> 03:51.532
I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR
YOU TO SEE ANOTHER THERAPIST,

03:51.565 --> 03:55.303
ONE WHO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE
WITH D.I.D. PATIENTS.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.770
I'VE DISCUSSED THIS
WITH MY CLINICAL SUPERVISOR

03:56.804 --> 03:58.606
WHO AGREES,

03:58.639 --> 04:00.974
AND WE'VE COME UP WITH SOME
RECOMMENDATIONS TOGETHER.

>> HEY, IF YOU THINK IT'LL HELP
TO THROW ANOTHER THERAPIST

04:03.444 --> 04:06.046
INTO THE MIX,
THEN LET'S PUSH EVEN HARDER.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.915
>> YOU'D ACTUALLY BE SEEING
ANOTHER THERAPIST

04:07.948 --> 04:09.383
INSTEAD OF ME.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.984
THIS OTHER DOCTOR
I'M THINKING OF

04:11.018 --> 04:14.288
RUNS AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.290
>> WAIT, SO...

04:16.324 --> 04:18.626
YOU'RE...BREAKING UP
WITH ME?

04:18.659 --> 04:22.796
>> TECHNICALLY,
IT'S A TERMINATION.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.533
>> [laughs] OH, GOD,
THAT'S EVEN WORSE.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.635
YOU'RE JUST GIVING UP ON ME.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.770
>> OH, NO, TARA.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.339
>> [scoffs]

04:31.372 --> 04:35.343
>> LET ME...REFRAME THIS
FOR YOU.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.611
IT'LL HELP IF YOU THINK OF IT

04:37.645 --> 04:39.513
NOT AS THE END
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP

04:39.547 --> 04:40.881
BUT AS A SORT OF GRADUATION

04:40.914 --> 04:43.351
FROM ONE STAGE OF TREATMENT
TO ANOTHER.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.419
AND WE'LL STILL HAVE
FOUR MORE SESSIONS TOGETHER

04:45.453 --> 04:49.390
TO HELP YOU THROUGH
THE TRANSITION.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.392
>> GREAT.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.594
JUST WHAT I NEED...

04:53.627 --> 04:57.398
MORE TRANSITIONS.

04:57.431 --> 05:00.901
>> SO A KISS LIKE
FROM HERE TO ETERNITY?

05:00.934 --> 05:04.104
>> MM. MORE LIKE
A PLACE IN THE SUN.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.774
>> MARSHALL!
>> I KNOW.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.077
LOOK, HE'S COMING.
JUST--JUST ACT NATURAL.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.788
>> WELL, THAT WASN'T VERY
MONTGOMERY CLIFT OF HIM.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.423
>> MAYBE HE DIDN'T SEE ME.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.558
>> YEAH, AND MAYBE
HE'S SECRETLY BLIND,

05:24.592 --> 05:26.727
LIKE HE LOST HIS EYESIGHT
TO CHILDHOOD FEVERS,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.829
BUT HE DEVELOPED SONAR
LIKE A BAT.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.531
>> OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.065
>> LOOK, MARSHALL, I MEAN,

05:32.099 --> 05:34.835
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU
ALL OOGLY AND EVERYTHING.

05:34.868 --> 05:38.506
I JUST DON'T EVER WANNA FIND YOU
CRUCIFIED ON A FENCE.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.709
>> TOO SOON FOR THAT REFERENCE.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.116
ASKING TO MEET HIM
AT THE BIKE TRAILS AFTER SCHOOL.

05:49.149 --> 05:52.085
>> DOES YOUR BIKE
EVEN HAVE GEARS?

05:52.119 --> 05:54.922
>> THREE OF THEM.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.790
>> SO WHEN ALL THE LEAVES
ARE BAGGED,

05:56.824 --> 05:59.159
AND MAKE SURE YOU USE THE BAGS
MADE OF RECYCLED PAPER.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.161
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE FLACK
WE GOT LAST YEAR.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.431
COST US A LOT OF VOTES.
>> BUMMER.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.699
>> YES, WE WANT ALL
THE DECORATIVE GRASSES

06:05.733 --> 06:07.468
CINCHED WITH BUNTING.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.169
THE EFFECT SHOULD BE LIKE
SHEAVES OF GRAIN.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.739
>> RIGHT, RIGHT, SO YOU CAN
REMIND THE MAYOR'S DONORS

06:11.772 --> 06:14.007
OF OUR GREAT AGRICULTURAL
HERITAGE, RIGHT?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.409
>> EXACTLY, MAX, AND--

06:15.443 --> 06:17.377
[horn honks]
>> UH, EXCUSE ME, CAROL!

06:18.512 --> 06:20.781
HEY, POP THE TRUNK.

06:23.116 --> 06:26.487
THANKS FOR HELPING ME OUT
WITH THIS STUFF.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.558
NO OFFENSE, BUT CAROL'S
LIKE ALICE ON METH.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.825
ARE THESE BIODEGRADABLE?

06:31.859 --> 06:34.595
>> TOTALLY.
>> YOU'RE THE BEST.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.564
HOW'D IT GO WITH OCEAN?

06:36.597 --> 06:39.567
>> HMM...OCEANIC.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.502
>> OCEANIC?
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.604
>> WELL, IT WAS INTERESTING.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.506
SHE THINKS I'M MAKING
REAL PROGRESS,

06:45.539 --> 06:48.642
BUT SHE ALSO WANTS TO TERMINATE
OUR THERAPY IN A MONTH.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.178
>> WHAT?

06:51.211 --> 06:54.682
OH, WHAT THE--
[thud]

06:54.715 --> 06:57.618
WE NEED HER.
WHY'D SHE DO THAT?

06:57.651 --> 06:58.819
>> I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.454
>> OH, HI, TARA.

07:00.488 --> 07:03.156
UM, MAX, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS BUT, UM,

07:03.190 --> 07:04.692
[whispering]
IS HE DOCUMENTED?

07:04.725 --> 07:06.460
>> OCTAVIO? VERY MUCH SO.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.761
>> OH, THANK HEAVENS.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.463
OKAY, SO AS SOON AS
YOU'RE READY,

07:09.497 --> 07:12.099
WE NEED TO TALK MUMS
AND GOURDS AND WHATNOT. TARA.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.734
>> YOU GOT IT, CAROL.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.237
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

07:17.270 --> 07:19.707
>> RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA
PICK UP CHARMAINE,

07:19.740 --> 07:22.476
AND THEN I'M GOING TO PROCESS...

07:22.510 --> 07:24.945
MY LAST THERAPY SESSION.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.948
>> OKAY.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.718
SOUNDS GOOD.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.753
>> MAX? MAX. MAX!

07:32.786 --> 07:34.522
THEY'RE RAKING UP MY BULBS!
MAX!

07:34.555 --> 07:35.889
>> STOP THAT.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.157
>> I GOTTA GO.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.996
>> SO HOW ARE YOU
FEELING TODAY?

07:43.030 --> 07:44.197
ALL FIXED UP?

07:44.231 --> 07:47.034
>> HMM?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.202
OH. 100%.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.038
>> IT MUST HAVE BEEN
MY CARE PACKAGE.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.575
>> YEAH. THE SOUP
WAS GREAT. THANKS.

07:54.608 --> 07:59.613
I'M JUST HERE FOR MY CHECK.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.115
>> YOU KNOW, KITTY, ANY SHIFT
MISSED DUE TO MALINGERING

08:02.149 --> 08:04.117
IS JUSTIFIABLE CAUSE
FOR SUSPENSION.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.086
AND/OR THE WITHHOLDING
OF ONE DAY'S PAY

08:06.119 --> 08:08.756
OR THE OUTRIGHT DISMISSAL
AT THE MANAGER'S DISCRETION.

IT'S IN THE BARNABEEZ
COVENANT.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.193

WITH A BETTER EXCUSE.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.901
>> UH...

08:20.934 --> 08:23.571
I SAW IT ON YOUR FRIDGE,
AND I-I COULDN'T RESIST.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.273
>> YOU STOLE A PICTURE
FROM ME?

WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

08:28.308 --> 08:31.111
>> IT WAS LOOKING
RIGHT AT ME.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.283
LOOK, YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK
IF-IF YOU WANT.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.885
>> NO, NO, NO.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.820
NO. IT'S OKAY.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.956
ACTUALLY, I DON'T EVER
WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN.

A PHOTO OF ME TOO

08:46.093 --> 08:49.296
FOR THOSE TIMES
THAT WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.802

GIVES PERKS LIKE THIS?

>> NO, IT'S FROM THAT
TEMP JOB I HAD

09:10.183 --> 09:11.985
AT THAT CONSTRUCTION COMPANY.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.021
I THINK AFTER THREE MONTHS
OF ANSWERING PHONES

09:14.054 --> 09:16.724
NEXT TO A PILE DRIVER,
THEY FELT SORRY FOR ME.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.892
>> I JUST HOPE YOU'RE NOT
WASTING IT ON ME.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.694
>> LOOK, IF ALL THE PEOPLE

09:20.728 --> 09:23.597
WHO SPENT ALL THEIR TIME
AND MONEY AT THERAPY EACH WEEK

09:23.631 --> 09:25.298
JUST TOOK A SPA DAY INSTEAD,

09:25.332 --> 09:27.234
THE WORLD WOULD BE
A MUCH SANER PLACE.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.236
>> MAYBE.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.639
I'M JUST--I'M STILL NOT SURE
ABOUT THE MASSAGE PART.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.240
I JUST DON'T LIKE STRANGERS
TOUCHING ME.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.375
>> YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
TRUST ME.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.146
>> WOW!
WELL, IS IT A GOOD PICTURE?

09:39.179 --> 09:40.781
>> WHO CARES
IF IT'S A GOOD PICTURE?

09:40.814 --> 09:42.650
IT'S CREEPY.
>> YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.619
AND HE'S USUALLY
MORE SUBTLE THAN THAT.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.787
>> USUALLY?

09:46.820 --> 09:49.657
>> WELL, EXCEPT FOR RIGHT NOW.

09:49.690 --> 09:53.827
THAT'S THE NEW TRAINEE.

AND SHE GOT A WHITE LEXUS
AND INVISALIGNS.

>> SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT EVERY GOOD AND TRUE MEMBER

10:13.246 --> 10:15.015

IT'S THAT THERE'S NO
FRATERNIZING OR LOITERING

10:18.218 --> 10:21.121
WHEN YOU'RE OFF THE CLOCK.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.256
>> DON'T WORRY.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.325
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.965
>> OH, YOU JUST WANTED
TO COME HERE

10:31.999 --> 10:33.834
SO YOU COULD SHOW OFF
YOUR NEW RACK.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.670
>> TRUE. BUT I ALSO NEED
TO GLOW TONIGHT.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.338
IT'S THE ALL-IMPORTANT
SECOND DATE.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.973
>> MM.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.409
>> DID I MENTION
HE'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYER?

10:42.442 --> 10:45.178
>> 30 TIMES.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.684
>> SO WHY DO YOU THINK OCEAN
JUST SUDDENLY DUMPED ME?

10:50.718 --> 10:52.753
>> WHO KNOWS, TARA?

10:52.786 --> 10:55.455
I MEAN...WE NEVER KNOW
WHY SOMEONE BREAKS UP WITH US.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.324
I MEAN, I LIE TO GUYS
ALL THE TIME,

10:57.357 --> 11:00.293
AND I'M SURE
THEY LIE TO ME.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.696
>> WELL, MAYBE DUMPED
IS A WRONG WORD CHOICE.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.231
WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY DATING.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.167
>> SURE SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.468
I MEAN, GOTTA GIVE HER
CREDIT, THOUGH,

11:08.501 --> 11:09.903
FOR THAT GRADUATION LINE.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.739
I'M GONNA BUST THAT ONE OUT.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.241
IT'S SO MUCH BETTER THAN,
"IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S ME."

11:14.274 --> 11:16.844
>> YOU KNOW, YOU COULD BE
A LITTLE MORE SYMPATHETIC.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.980
>> I AM SYMPATHETIC.
I MEAN, WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.181
DID YOU THINK YOU WERE
GONNA KEEP SEEING HER

11:21.214 --> 11:23.083
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

11:23.116 --> 11:26.219
>> NO. JUST UNTIL I GOT BETTER.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.188
SHE WAS THE FIRST THERAPIST
I COULD TRUST.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.791
NOW I HAVE TO START ALL OVER
AGAIN WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

11:30.824 --> 11:34.194
>> WELL, MAYBE YOU WERE
TOO MUCH FOR HER.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.196
I MEAN, YOU ARE
A HANDFUL, TARA.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.331
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.133
>> THERE'S FOUR OF YOU.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.169
PLUS OCEAN.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.237
THAT'S NOT A RELATIONSHIP.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.107
IT'S AN ORGY.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.243
>> LADIES, IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR MASSAGES.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.789
>> OKAY, YOU CAN LIE FLAT, DEAR.
JUST REST YOUR HEAD HERE.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.957
>> IN THE...
BIG DONUT THINGY?

12:03.991 --> 12:05.926
>> [chuckles] THAT'S RIGHT.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.895
ALL RIGHT.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.333
>> LET'S SEE.
HERE WE GO.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.136
NOW, I'M GONNA BEGIN
VERY GENTLY...

12:16.169 --> 12:18.205
AND YOU JUST LET ME KNOW

12:18.238 --> 12:20.974
IF YOU'D LIKE SOMETHING
MORE INTENSE.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.179
>> OOH. YOU CARRY
ALL YOUR TENSION HERE.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.447
>> [sharp inhale]

12:27.480 --> 12:29.149
>> OOH.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.118
[voice fading]
OH, WAS THAT TOO MUCH?

12:31.151 --> 12:32.820
>> MM...MM...

12:32.853 --> 12:35.088
>> OH...

12:35.122 --> 12:40.427
>> [breathing heavily,
moaning softly]

12:42.395 --> 12:45.165
>> I-I'M SORRY, MA'AM,
BUT IT'S YOUR SISTER.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.267
>> OH. OF COURSE IT IS.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.108
TARA--

12:55.142 --> 12:57.310
>> [snorting,
gulping tearfully]

12:57.344 --> 12:58.979
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

12:59.012 --> 13:01.915
>> [wailing]

13:01.949 --> 13:06.319
[commotion, yelling]

13:06.353 --> 13:08.822
>> [Tara whimpering]

13:12.392 --> 13:14.127
>> TARA.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.295
TARA...

13:15.328 --> 13:16.463
>> HEY!

13:16.496 --> 13:19.166
HANDS OFF, BITCHES!

13:19.199 --> 13:20.868
GOD!

13:20.901 --> 13:23.436
>> OKAY. OKAY.
SHE'S OKAY.

13:23.470 --> 13:28.008
SHE'S GOT A TOUCH PHOBIA...
THING.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.010
[whispering]
TARA, WHAT WAS THAT?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.544
THAT--THAT FIT THING?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.613
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.983
>> THAT--[wailing]
THAT THING.

13:36.016 --> 13:39.152
>> [laughing]
YOU'RE MESSED UP.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.254
>> UM...T...

13:41.288 --> 13:42.956
T, LOOK, I KNOW
YOU DON'T LIKE ME,

13:42.990 --> 13:44.624
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT
UP WITH EACH OTHER

13:44.657 --> 13:46.226
FOR A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.195
THAT WAS REALLY SCARY
BACK THERE.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.064
T. T. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO JUST LEAVE TARA ALONE

13:51.098 --> 13:52.499
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.367
>> WHY DON'T I LEAVE
YOU ALONE?

13:54.401 --> 13:56.069
[pops lips]

13:56.103 --> 13:57.304
YEAH!

13:57.337 --> 13:58.872
>> I'M JUST GONNA, UH...

13:58.906 --> 14:00.573
TARA!
>> CHARMAINE!

14:00.607 --> 14:02.309
>> WELCOME.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.344
YOU HAVE REACHED BARNABEEZ'
HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.246
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN
THE BARNABEEZ FAMILY,

14:06.279 --> 14:08.916
PRESS OR SAY ONE.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.517
IF YOU ARE ALREADY A MEMBER--

14:10.550 --> 14:11.551
>> DAD. YOU'RE HOME.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.586
>> HEY, HONEY.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.388
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN T
BY ANY CHANCE, HAVE YOU?

14:15.422 --> 14:17.324
>> NO. WHY?
WHAT'D SHE DO NOW?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.592
>> OH, HAD AN EPISODE
AT THE SPA, DITCHED YOUR AUNT.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.628
>> AND NOW
I'M ALL TENSE AGAIN.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.631
>> DEFINE EPISODE.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.433
>> MAX?
>> WAIT.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.302
>> WELL, APPARENTLY
YOUR MOM

14:29.336 --> 14:32.039
REALLY DOESN'T LIKE
MASSAGES.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.640
>> WHAT HAPPENED?
IS SHE OKAY?

14:33.673 --> 14:36.276
>> NO, SHE'S FINE.
SHE...JUST KIND OF...

14:36.309 --> 14:39.146
GOT STRESSED OUT BECAUSE HER
THERAPIST IS TERMINATING HER.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.048
>> SHE DIDN'T TERMINATE HER.
IT'S NOT ROBOCOP.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.016
>> MAX, HER THERAPIST
IS BREAKING UP WITH HER.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.085
>> [gasps]
WHY ARE THEY BREAKING UP?

14:45.118 --> 14:46.386
>> WHO'S BREAKING UP?

14:46.419 --> 14:48.121
>> HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT IS MINE.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.057
WE CHARGED IT
TO MY CREDIT CARD.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.325
>> I'LL REIMBURSE YOU,
CHARMAINE.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.962
OKAY?

14:56.263 --> 14:57.430
>> [gasping]

14:57.464 --> 15:00.033
>> HEY! KNOCK IT OFF.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.434
>> JACKASS.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.370
>> OLD BITCH.
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.972
>> SUIT YOURSELF.

15:05.005 --> 15:08.375
[exhales]
GOD, PLEASE.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.011
>> WHAT HAPPENED AT THE SPA?

15:11.044 --> 15:13.313
>> THEY WERE ALL UP IN MY FACE.
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.149
>> SOUNDS LIKE GIMME CAME OUT.
ANY IDEA WHY?

15:16.183 --> 15:18.051
>> MAN, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

15:18.085 --> 15:19.219
I DON'T KNOW SPIT ABOUT
THAT GIMME SPIT.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.621
>> ALL RIGHT.
I BELIEVE YOU.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.257
WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT TO THE SHED
AND CHILL OUT FOR A BIT?

15:24.291 --> 15:27.427
>> 'CAUSE I'M ALREADY CHILL.
I'M THE CHILL-CHILL-CHILLINGEST.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.196
[scoffs]

15:29.229 --> 15:31.965
NOW I NEED TO SMOKE
BECAUSE OF THIS INTERROGATION.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.067
>> NO FURTHER THAN THE YARD.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.668
>> YES, DAD!

15:35.702 --> 15:38.471
>> MAX, I KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE STILL SORTING STUFF OUT,

15:38.505 --> 15:41.641
BUT I HAVE A DATE TONIGHT
THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO MISS.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.310
SO DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD DRIVE ME HOME

15:43.343 --> 15:47.314
SO I COULD FLAT-IRON MY HAIR
AND GET MY GLOW ON?

15:47.347 --> 15:50.217
>> YOU THINK YOU COULD STAY HERE
TILL TARA COMES BACK, PLEASE?

15:50.250 --> 15:52.485
>> HOW LONG'S THAT GONNA BE?

15:52.519 --> 15:54.354
>> I DON'T KNOW.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.289
>> OKAY.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.358
SURE. FINE.

16:09.402 --> 16:12.405
>> THAT WAS...I...

16:12.439 --> 16:14.707
YOU'RE RIGHT--THAT'S DEFINITELY
THE BEST WAY HOME.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.609
>> YEAH. IT'S GREAT UP THERE.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.778
SO MUCH SIMPLER,
AWAY FROM EVERYONE ELSE.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.647
>> HEY, REVEREND,
YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.650
>> YO, YO, WHASSUP, BOYS?

16:23.683 --> 16:25.718
>> I BELIEVE YOU'VE MET T
BEFORE.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.487
>> YOU BEEN OUT RIDIN', HUH?

16:27.520 --> 16:29.756
>> I TAKE THE BIKE TRAILS
HOME EVERY DAY.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.392
>> SO THAT'S HOW YOU KEEP
YOUR TRUNK PACKED SO TIGHT.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.127
>> SHOULDN'T YOU BE WATCHING
JERRY SPRINGER?

16:34.161 --> 16:36.296
>> YEAH. BUT CHARMAINE'S
IN THE HOUSE.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.031
>> THEN WHY DON'T YOU
GO HANG OUT IN THE SHED?

16:38.065 --> 16:43.336
>> NO SMOKIN' IN THE SHED!
PFFT.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.771
OOH!

16:44.804 --> 16:47.474
YOU WANT SOME ALONE TIME.

16:47.507 --> 16:51.644
HEY, I'M COOL.
T DON'T JUDGE.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.381
>> SORRY. EVERY FAMILY'S
GOT A DOWNWARDLY MOBILE ONE.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.284
>> I LIKE HER.
I THINK SHE'S FUNNY.

16:57.317 --> 17:01.188
>> WOW. YOU EVEN LIKE
MY FAMILY.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.823
SO DO YOU
WANNA HANG OUT AGAIN?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.492
>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.061
LET'S RIDE OUR BIKES HOME
AGAIN TOMORROW.

17:08.095 --> 17:11.064
>> YEAH. I-I MEANT KIND OF...

17:11.098 --> 17:13.500
HANG OUT...IN MY ROOM...

17:13.533 --> 17:16.469
WHICH IS A VERY PEACEFUL PLACE
AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE.

17:16.503 --> 17:21.274
>> YOU KNOW, I NOTICED THAT
LAST WEEKEND.

17:21.308 --> 17:22.842
>> IT WASN'T BAD, WAS IT?

17:22.875 --> 17:26.613
>> NO. IT WASN'T BAD AT ALL.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.615
WE CAN DO THAT AGAIN.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.084
>> WE COULD DO THAT NOW,
YOU KNOW.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.089
>> HEY, MARSH.
CAN I SEE YOU INSIDE?

17:36.123 --> 17:37.657
>> RIGHT NOW, DAD?

17:37.690 --> 17:39.659
THIS...MOMENT IN HISTORY?

17:39.692 --> 17:42.462
>> YEAH, IT'S IMPORTANT.
HEY, JASON.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.664
>> JEEZ. I HATE IMPORTANT.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.599
>> [chuckles] BE COOL, BRO.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.801
TOMORROW...WE RIDE AGAIN.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.304
>> ALL RIGHT. COOL.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.482
>> HEY. SO, UH...

18:02.515 --> 18:05.585

MARSHALL'S BIKE THERE?

18:05.618 --> 18:08.855
>> OH. WHERE DOES HE KEEP IT?

18:08.888 --> 18:13.260
>> COME ON.
I'LL SHOW YA.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.267
OVER THERE.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.674
[door thuds]

18:27.707 --> 18:29.876
>> SO...

18:29.909 --> 18:33.646
YOU'RE MARSHALL'S BF, HUH?

18:33.680 --> 18:36.883
>> UH...I'M NOT
ANYBODY'S BF.

18:36.916 --> 18:41.221
>> OH, JUST GETTIN' BENEFITS.
[giggling]

18:41.254 --> 18:44.657
YOU LIKE BOYS THOUGH, RIGHT?

18:44.691 --> 18:47.460
>> MAYBE.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.496
>> YOU LIKE GIRLS?

18:49.529 --> 18:52.699
>> MAYBE.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.902
>> MAYBE...YOU'RE BISEXUAL.

18:55.935 --> 18:59.672
>> MAYBE I'M 16.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.375
>> WE'RE THE SAME AGE,
YOU KNOW.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.777
>> [laughs]

19:04.811 --> 19:06.646
ARE YOU SURE?

19:06.679 --> 19:09.849
>> OH, YEAH.
VERY SURE.

19:09.882 --> 19:14.554
I'M JUST MATURE FOR MY AGE.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.523
>> IT'S JUST BIZARRE.

19:16.556 --> 19:20.560
SO MOM'S NEW ALTER
IS AN ANIMAL?

19:20.593 --> 19:21.928
>> IT'S NOT AN ANIMAL.

19:21.961 --> 19:25.198
IT'S LIKE A...
PRIMITIVE SIDE OF HER.

19:25.232 --> 19:28.801
PREVERBAL.
NO SOCIAL SKILLS.

19:28.835 --> 19:32.272
UM...KIND OF ALTER
THAT DEFACES MURALS

19:32.305 --> 19:34.607
AND PEES IN PEOPLE'S BEDS.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.543
>> I KNEW I DIDN'T
WET THE BED.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.378
>> EEW! OH, MY GOD.

19:38.411 --> 19:45.918
>> THAT IS SUCH A RELIEF.
AND YET NOT AT ALL.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.355
>> WELL, THIS IS FANTASTIC.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.623
TARA THINKS SHE'S A ROTTWEILER
OR SOMETHING.

19:50.657 --> 19:51.958
CONGRATULATIONS, MARSHALL.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.693
YOU FINALLY GOT THAT DOG
YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.362
>> SHUT UP.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.663
>> DAD, CAN YOU PLEASE
INSTALL A LOCK ON MY DOOR?

19:56.696 --> 19:58.565
I JUST REALIZED
THAT I DON'T WANT MOM

19:58.598 --> 20:00.733
TO COME IN AND PEE ON ME.
>> SHE'S NOT GONNA PEE ON YOU.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.869
>> NOT IF YOU WALK HER
REGULARLY.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.904
>> OKAY, I KNOW
IT'S A STRESSFUL TIME,

20:04.937 --> 20:06.939
BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU CAN
KEEP IT TOGETHER?

20:06.973 --> 20:10.009
>> SORRY.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.744
>> SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

20:11.778 --> 20:13.946
>> NOTHIN' TILL MOM
COMES HOME, OKAY?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.982
NO DECISIONS WITHOUT HER.
AGREED?

20:19.619 --> 20:21.788
>> I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON HER.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.357
>> GOOD IDEA, MARSH.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.560
>> THANKS, MARSH.

20:34.301 --> 20:38.305
[voices, laughter]

20:47.314 --> 20:48.848
[door thuds]

20:48.881 --> 20:50.717
>> HEY. GET THE HELL
OUTTA MY SHED.
