00:02.360 --> 00:06.433
<i>Things were amazing with Kylie, but</i>
<i>before I could get emotionally invested,</i>

00:06.520 --> 00:09.114
<i>I needed answers</i>
<i>to some very important questions.</i>

00:09.200 --> 00:11.634
Name three spin-offs
of the sitcom <i>Happy Days.</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:15.395
<i>Mork and Mindy, Laverne and Shirley,</i>
and <i>Joanie loves Chachi.</i>

00:15.480 --> 00:18.119
You marry her. You marry her now.
You marry her!

00:18.200 --> 00:19.599
OK! We passed section one,

00:19.680 --> 00:22.831
"Sitcoms about or involving
Asian-American diner owners".

00:22.920 --> 00:24.239
Now onto section two.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.878
"Fat, tubby TV husbands

00:25.960 --> 00:29.032
and the hot women that would
never actually marry them".

00:29.120 --> 00:31.475
Hey, we're missing <i>Sanford and Son.</i>

00:31.560 --> 00:32.913
- What?
- Yes!

00:33.000 --> 00:35.150
<i>Turk was freaked out.</i>
<i>Carla neverjoins us</i>

00:35.240 --> 00:37.993
<i>on</i> Sanford and Son <i>or</i> Cheers <i>night.</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:42.198
<i>I think she was feeling romantically</i>
<i>competitive with Kylie and me.</i>

00:44.160 --> 00:46.754
Woman, woman! I am not a lollipop!

00:48.600 --> 00:50.636
<i>Quiet down now</i>

00:50.720 --> 00:52.836
<i>It is time to watch the show</i>

00:52.920 --> 00:54.717
<i>Yes, it started</i>

00:54.800 --> 00:56.552
<i>Don't be licking me no more</i>

00:56.640 --> 01:00.315
<i>Matter of fact</i>
<i>Could you get me a handiwipe?</i>

01:02.400 --> 01:05.153
<i>Carla certainly tried</i>
<i>to be as adorable as us.</i>

01:05.239 --> 01:06.992
Darn it! You won.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.992
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Turk wasn't on the same wavelength.</i>

01:11.080 --> 01:13.548
Do you see what you get, Carla?

01:13.640 --> 01:17.553
Do you see what you get
when you mess with the warrior!

01:19.520 --> 01:20.748
Yes!

01:21.160 --> 01:22.752
Ten to 9.00!

01:25.440 --> 01:26.839
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.758
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.508
Kylie's in class all day
and bartends at night,

01:37.600 --> 01:39.556
and I'm still pulling 16-hour shifts,

01:39.640 --> 01:41.756
so we try to make sure
we kiss once a day.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.673
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,
she takes a cab here.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.196
Tuesdays and Thursdays...
<i>I scooter to my baby</i>

01:49.000 --> 01:50.558
Honey...

01:50.640 --> 01:53.677
...I haven't fuffied in bed in,
like, a week.

01:55.320 --> 02:01.031
<i>With 27 deaths so far, this strain</i>
<i>of E. Coli from tainted meat is serious.</i>

02:01.120 --> 02:03.953
<i>So if you're a big meat-eater,</i>
<i>be careful.</i>

02:06.160 --> 02:09.869
<i>We were upset because when the media</i>
<i>reports on a weird health crisis,</i>

02:09.960 --> 02:12.520
<i>everyone who sees it</i>
<i>thinks they have it.</i>

02:14.160 --> 02:17.118
Oh, not so bad.
It's only a few people here.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.760 --> 02:39.230
OK, OK, everybody just shut up!

02:40.760 --> 02:42.716
Thank you. Now, who's first?

02:43.680 --> 02:46.513
<i>There's one positive</i>
<i>when things like this happen...</i>

02:49.800 --> 02:52.758
I love medicine!

02:52.840 --> 02:55.479
Grandma, that's my no-fly zone.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.919
Dr Cox! We're having
a bit of a crisis here.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.197
I see that. It seems you two
have worn the same outfit.

03:18.560 --> 03:23.156
Barbie, if it's of any consolation,
it looks slightly better on you.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.992
No, I'm talking about all the...

03:25.800 --> 03:27.313
- Thank you.
- Sure.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.994
- What are we supposed to do?
- Loretta, relax.

03:30.080 --> 03:33.595
I've been involved in every
ridiculous TV-induced panic there is.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.797
Poison pills, SARS, West Nile,
North Face, South Fork, East River,

03:36.880 --> 03:39.997
monkey pox, Pop Rocks, toilet snakes,
mad cow, bird flu, swine flu

03:40.080 --> 03:43.834
and, quite frankly, every other flu
that you could really only catch

03:43.920 --> 03:47.037
if you actually fornicate
with the animal it's named for.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.714
As a parting gift, I will tell you this:

03:49.800 --> 03:52.837
Narrow it down to two symptoms,
vomiting and diarrhoea,

03:52.920 --> 03:57.789
because it's just not E. Coli
unless it's firing out both exits.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.755
Sure hope I don't have dog flu.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.599
Mr Bernstein,
do you have vomiting and diarrhoea?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.113
- No.
- No.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.189
- No.
- No.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.395
- No.
- No.

04:09.480 --> 04:13.359
- No.
- OK, then, Mr James, you're free to...

04:13.440 --> 04:15.829
Wait a second. Charles James?

04:15.920 --> 04:18.149
I was watching the <i>Cheers</i> DVD.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.152
- Are you Charles James the writer?
- Yeah, that's me.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.913
<i>Just... stay... calm.</i>

04:24.000 --> 04:26.230
I need to take this man upstairs
for tests.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.958
J. D, don't leave me here.

04:28.040 --> 04:32.033
This is very important!
He may even need a surgical consult.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.798
Norm!

04:35.880 --> 04:37.074
Yeah, I get it.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.274
What are you doing?
No tongue before 10.00.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.830
If J. D and Kylie can make time
for that appointment kiss once a day,

04:51.920 --> 04:54.036
we should be able to do it twice a day.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.519
Love is not a competition.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.955
- OK.
- Make it three times.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.554
- All right. I'll see you at noon?
- Noon.

05:00.640 --> 05:01.914
You youngsters.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.437
If there is one thing I have learned,
it's that you can't schedule love.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.988
Your credit card statement
would beg to differ.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.793
OK, listen up, everyone.
For budgetary reasons,

05:12.880 --> 05:16.634
we are turning the bathrooms on
even-numbered floors into patient rooms.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.109
Floors two and four
are no longer for one or two.

05:19.640 --> 05:23.076
There's still a bathroom on two,
but my joke wouldn't have worked.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.752
Well?

05:28.080 --> 05:30.116
I'm sorry. Please repeat the question.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.758
Are you going to roll over?

05:31.840 --> 05:34.479
That's weird. I asked him
the same thing last night.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.949
Where's the outrage,
the anger, the hate?

05:37.040 --> 05:38.792
Again, last night.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.758
- You've gone soft.
- OK, now it's getting spooky.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.119
Look, you're the only one
who can stand up to Kelso.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.237
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to present

05:48.320 --> 05:50.356
man not caring.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.996
OK, Jordan, little help.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.991
If you don't do what she wants,

05:55.080 --> 05:57.071
I'm going to stop having sex with you

05:57.160 --> 05:59.628
and start making love. Love you...

05:59.720 --> 06:03.474
Where is that bastard? Kelso!

06:04.680 --> 06:06.511
- My wife's name's Carla.
- Yeah.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.431
- Like from the show.
- Just like it.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.671
I never met anyone with the
same name as the show's character.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.557
- Really?
- No.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.438
That's understandable.
I mean, there's a lot of Sams.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.112
Excuse me, J. D!

06:18.200 --> 06:21.590
I just spent the last 3 hours
interviewing 212 hypochondriacs,

06:21.680 --> 06:23.432
half didn't speak any English.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.239
Any idea how embarrassing
it is to mime diarrhoea?!

06:28.280 --> 06:30.430
Talk about your Dianes!

06:30.520 --> 06:32.829
Damn! It's kiss time!

06:49.680 --> 06:50.829
Baby.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.234
Baby?

07:06.200 --> 07:08.156
Come here, girl. Right here.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.549
That's where I want it.
I want it right there.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.671
- Where have you been?
- I was up at...

07:15.520 --> 07:17.078
- Gotta go.
- Gotta go.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.350
Bob. Bob.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.797
- Sorry, Madge.
- What do you want, Perry?

07:27.880 --> 07:31.270
Bob, enough with the
stinking budget cuts already.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.318
Noted. Now, if you will excuse me,
I have to fire someone.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.913
Oh, baloney, old man!

07:36.000 --> 07:39.788
I have to cut $27,000
from the cafeteria budget,

07:39.880 --> 07:43.839
and my idea of getting it all back
by charging $100 for a piece of cake

07:43.920 --> 07:47.879
went right out the window when Fat Frank
decided to go on that power diet.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.713
I lost over 230 pounds so far.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.872
- Why does he wear those pants?
- All right. Fair enough.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.633
I got your budget reports.
You don't know who to fire.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.598
Fine. Keep them. You do it.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.910
Watch and learn. I'll do it,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.355
and I'll do it
without firing a single person.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.076
I have to fire someone.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.873
I can't believe you left me alone
for a stupid TV writer!

08:19.960 --> 08:24.636
Is that different from when you hung out
with that weatherman from Channel 4?

08:24.720 --> 08:28.190
The man had a massive heart attack.
I was nothing but professional.

08:28.280 --> 08:31.636
OK, he's stable!
Just take the picture, Carla!

08:33.520 --> 08:34.554
What do you want?

08:34.640 --> 08:38.792
I want you to go in there and tell him
there's no reason for him to be up here.

08:43.559 --> 08:47.189
- How long have you had that cough?
- Oh, a couple months now.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.758
Am I wrong, Elliot, or is that the kind
of cough that needs a chest x-ray?

08:51.840 --> 08:53.831
- Probably.
- Thank you.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.439
- Hey, yo, Turk!
- What's up?

08:57.520 --> 09:00.318
I got a break.
You want to play some ball?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.118
Definitely.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.870
Baby. Yeah, I'm not going
to make our next kiss.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.552
I'm swamped too. Yeah.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.076
Right now I'm helping
Dr Schwartz reset a patient's leg.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.549
I think you got it, Dr Schwartz.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.239
You're a liar!

09:22.160 --> 09:24.628
Oh, for God's sake, Perry,

09:24.720 --> 09:28.508
adjust your bra, man up and fire
the one with the least pathetic story.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.194
Do you think I know
any of these people's stories?

09:31.280 --> 09:33.589
Well, let me fill you in.

09:33.680 --> 09:37.195
First is Hank. Four kids. Trying
to make it on a dishwasher's salary.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.590
Next to him is Mike. Lost half his leg
in a motorcycle accident.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.672
And then there's Judy.
Been here 30 years.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.318
Two away from retirement.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.391
You're friends with all these people?

09:47.480 --> 09:49.914
Are you kidding me? I read their files.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.117
I read everybody's files,
Ms Manic-depressive,

09:53.200 --> 09:55.873
- Dr Drinks-a-lot.
- Hold your horses!

09:55.960 --> 09:58.918
Just tell me who the
last person hired was, please?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.956
Looks like you could use a refresher.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.793
Serving people like you
who save lives every day

10:03.880 --> 10:06.633
makes me happier
than a kitten chasing a leaky cow.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.676
God bless you. God bless you.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.797
- I have to fire Opie, don't I?
- You think?

10:15.120 --> 10:19.398
Metastatic lung cancer?
How was he walking around with this?

10:19.480 --> 10:22.756
At worst, I thought maybe
he had a bad case of bronchitis.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.398
This is going to suck.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.999
Why'd they move me up here?

10:30.600 --> 10:33.990
Mr James,
I'm not quite sure how to say this,

10:34.080 --> 10:35.559
but you have lung cancer.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.552
<i>It was strange telling him</i>
<i>he may only have weeks to live</i>

10:38.640 --> 10:41.279
<i>when a few hours ago,</i>
<i>we all thought he was fine.</i>

10:41.360 --> 10:43.555
<i>It made me realize something.</i>

10:43.640 --> 10:45.995
<i>Whether it was giving</i>
<i>bad news to a patient,</i>

10:46.080 --> 10:49.516
<i>or realizing your relationship</i>
<i>isn't as stable as you thought...</i>

10:49.600 --> 10:53.115
We couldn't even make it one day.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.708
<i>... or having to do</i>
<i>someone else's dirty work...</i>

10:56.800 --> 10:59.633
Say, Kenny?
Can I talk to you for a second?

11:00.600 --> 11:03.956
<i>... there are moments when we all</i>
<i>wish life was more like a sitcom.</i>

11:04.040 --> 11:05.758
I'm so sorry.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.072
I'm sorry, too, sir.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.355
The good news is I won't have to eat
my wife's cooking anymore, right?

11:17.080 --> 11:21.039
<i>J. D's sitcom fantasy will be back</i>
<i>after these messages.</i>

11:25.600 --> 11:29.559
<i>J. D's sitcom fantasy is filmed</i>
<i>in front of a live studio audience.</i>

11:38.920 --> 11:42.151
It's weird. There's so many things
I never got to do in my life,

11:42.240 --> 11:45.789
like go to a carnival
or take a ride in a hot-air balloon.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.438
We can do all that.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.954
We are going
to give you the best day ever.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.559
Elliot, a word?

11:54.680 --> 11:58.355
A hot-air balloon seems kind of
dangerous. I mean, he could get hurt.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.796
What's he going to do, bruise
one of his giant malignant tumours?

12:03.240 --> 12:05.708
Safety is always important, Elliot.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.554
Oh, my God. You're afraid
of balloon rides, aren't you?

12:10.640 --> 12:13.757
It's floating wicker propelled by fire!

12:14.360 --> 12:17.477
Besides, I defy you to find
one other thing that I'm afraid of.

12:17.560 --> 12:20.950
It's mopping time.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.871
It's mopping time.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.994
There he is.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.158
Yes, it's mopping time and,
as you know, I like to start

12:32.240 --> 12:34.117
in the exact spot you're standing.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.430
Let's get to work. Here we go.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.078
Is that my new sweater?

12:38.160 --> 12:41.630
No. This is my new sweater mop.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.958
It went dynamite with my beige cords.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.515
You mean my beige cord sponge?

13:00.840 --> 13:03.149
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.550
I wanted to tell you that I...
I think you're doing a great job.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.877
Boy, that meatloaf today was...
it was virtually hairless.

13:11.760 --> 13:15.355
I took off the gloves, it makes
the hair a lot easier to pick out.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.552
Get out of here.

13:20.600 --> 13:25.435
Perry, why the hell is he still here?
When I go back down to the cafeteria,

13:25.520 --> 13:28.080
there had better
be only three workers there.

13:28.160 --> 13:32.233
Unless Margaret spits out another kid.
That woman's like a Catholic bunny.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.908
Get it done.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.639
Why? Why am I having
such a hard time with this?

13:36.720 --> 13:39.188
Because apparently you have girl parts.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.591
Kelso said that if we
can cover his salary in the budget

13:43.680 --> 13:45.193
that Kenny can stay.

13:45.280 --> 13:50.513
But where are we going
to come up with $26,372?

13:53.680 --> 13:55.398
You thinking what I'm thinking?

13:55.480 --> 13:59.075
Yeah. That...
that we invite muscles here

13:59.160 --> 14:03.836
to hang a banner in our bedroom
that says "It takes three to party"?

14:03.920 --> 14:07.469
All right, knuckleheads. I need
one of you to win this talent show.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.516
I can do Shakespeare in German!

14:12.360 --> 14:15.716
In college, I double-majored
in theatre and classic languages.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.951
Does that degree come
with headgear and allergies?

14:19.920 --> 14:21.911
Let's take a look at our other options.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.515
You appear to be a man
who is utterly without talent,

14:25.600 --> 14:29.718
unless you want to count the fact that
you are the 20th-best basketball player

14:29.800 --> 14:32.030
in a predominantly white hospital.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.679
Jordan, your only skill
is illegal in 26 states.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.796
It's 27. Arkansas buckled.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.070
Carla, that makes you my girl.

14:45.160 --> 14:49.597
We could crank up the humidity and watch
your hair explode. That'd be terrific.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.830
Which leaves me, and...

14:51.920 --> 14:54.912
...unless all of you want
to see me turn a two-syllable word

14:55.000 --> 14:59.312
into a six syllable word,
I really think...

15:01.040 --> 15:02.632
...we should keep looking.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.270
Newbie! I almost forgot about you.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.078
You know what? Save your breath.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.755
I'm about to get in a hot-air balloon
and get Evel Knievel on my own ass.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.951
Come on, Elliot.
Let's go French kiss the sun.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.595
You know, you're wrong about Turk.
He has many, many talents.

15:21.680 --> 15:25.116
Yeah, he's really good at not
finding five seconds to kiss his wife.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.079
Wow! That's interesting
because you're really good at that too.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.673
- Oh, really?
- Really.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.909
- Really?
- Really!

15:32.000 --> 15:34.594
I know how long we've been married
and what our song is.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.478
I don't know the name of it,
but I it goes like this...

15:43.400 --> 15:46.437
Are you humming the
<i>Let's All Go To the Movies</i> song?

15:46.520 --> 15:48.158
Is that not our song?

15:48.240 --> 15:49.798
It's sung by hot dogs.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.672
What an amazing day!

15:55.760 --> 15:58.832
A balloon ride, lunch by the beach
and my first carnival.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.150
Sorry you missed
getting your face painted.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.435
They only had time
to paint one more face,

16:03.520 --> 16:06.398
so I let the kid behind me go
to make him stop crying.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.391
That was awesome!

16:11.680 --> 16:13.955
Spider-girl...

16:17.200 --> 16:18.918
Talent show's about to start.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.629
Talent show? I'd love to see it,
but I'm too tired to get out of bed.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.233
That sucks for you!

16:26.040 --> 16:28.349
I'm kidding!
We're going to do it right here!

16:31.520 --> 16:34.193
O Romeo, Romeo...

16:47.560 --> 16:49.312
Gesundheit.

16:51.280 --> 16:56.115
Hey, I'm wondering,
what's the story with steel wool?

16:56.200 --> 17:00.239
I mean, is it steel or is it wool?
Make up your mind, steel wool.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.709
Are there iron sheep
hopping around Scotland?

17:05.119 --> 17:07.315
Oh, brother.

17:07.400 --> 17:11.075
Look, I... Start laughing
or I start unplugging machines.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.675
And if any of you cows, goats
or ducks have any questions,

17:17.760 --> 17:19.829
don't be afraid to ask me.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.911
I'm just like all of you,

17:22.000 --> 17:25.356
only giant and human.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.949
Thank you. I hope you
enjoyed our production

17:29.040 --> 17:31.508
of <i>World's Most Giant Doctor</i>
<i>Goes to the Farm.</i>

17:32.480 --> 17:34.630
So, what did we end up going with?

17:34.720 --> 17:36.676
Oh, you went with the farm idea.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.996
Oh, my God, we're doomed.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.590
OK, Perry, that's it. It's over.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.592
The only act left to see
is you firing that guy.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.830
Wait, wait. There's one more contestant.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.394
Oh, no. Is that Kenny?

17:52.480 --> 17:54.630
Hi. I'm Kenny.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.029
Yeah, it is.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.755
- Hey. That... that's our song.
- Yeah, I know. I told him to sing it.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.633
All right, give it to him.
You know he deserves it.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.392
The winner.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.834
We are going to go home
and spend some time together.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.797
Some good time.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.269
And by good time,
she means bumping uglies.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.920
Well, I hope you had a good day,
Mr James.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.114
Wait a second!

19:02.200 --> 19:05.749
This chart isn't for Charles James.
It's for James Charles.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.751
He's the one who has cancer, not you.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.956
Who cares about him?
He's anti-Semitic!

19:10.040 --> 19:11.155
Exactly.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.435
Well, that's a load off my mind.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.636
Hey, everybody!

19:17.920 --> 19:19.672
Thanks for coming so quickly.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.308
This is the kind of thing
I say out loud in my head.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.674
But since we're here...

19:26.760 --> 19:29.911
It just seems like in the end,
everything always works out

19:30.000 --> 19:31.831
because as long as we...

19:33.080 --> 19:36.709
Mr James? Mr James, can you hear me?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.189
He's apnoeic!
We need an airway! Anaesthesia!

19:39.280 --> 19:42.477
- <i>Wait. This isn't right.</i>
- We're going to intubate.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.871
Hang some dopamine, wide open!

19:44.960 --> 19:47.190
I need an ET tube. Where's Anaesthesia?

19:47.280 --> 19:51.353
<i>Unfortunately, things don't always end</i>
<i>as neat and tidy as they do in sitcoms.</i>

19:53.400 --> 19:56.517
<i>Relationships aren't always</i>
<i>magically fixed in 30 minutes.</i>

19:56.600 --> 19:58.556
<i>You have to work on them.</i>

19:59.000 --> 20:01.355
<i>Problems don't always</i>
<i>have easy solutions.</i>

20:01.440 --> 20:04.876
Hey, Kenny, once again,
I'm... I'm real sorry.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.757
Welcome to my world.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.912
Now imagine going home to my wife.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.834
<i>And around here,</i>
<i>nice people don't always get better.</i>

20:18.520 --> 20:21.114
<i>And at times like that,</i>
<i>it's comforting to know</i>

20:21.200 --> 20:24.272
<i>there's always one thing</i>
<i>that can pick your spirits up.</i>
