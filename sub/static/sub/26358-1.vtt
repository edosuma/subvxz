WEBVTT

00:03.742 --> 00:05.483
MOSLEY: Spencer Williams and I
had a child.

00:05.527 --> 00:06.702
He took my boy.

00:06.745 --> 00:08.225
I don't think we should
be getting married.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.444
You Arlo Turk

00:09.487 --> 00:11.185
Friends of Hetty.Agent Gonzalez.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.187
Sinaloa is not Mexico.
It's a different beast.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.666
ERIC: This is the last
known position of Hidoko.

00:14.710 --> 00:15.580
CALLEN: Somebody burned
something last night.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.060
I just hope it wasn't her.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.409
DEEKS:
Let's go! Get 'em in the air!

00:18.453 --> 00:20.455
Rocket!Everybody out!

00:28.637 --> 00:30.639
Hey.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.252
Morning.

00:35.296 --> 00:37.472
How's he doing?

00:39.517 --> 00:41.258
KENSI:
Oh, my gosh.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.478
A little Blye-Deeks.

00:43.521 --> 00:44.957
Deeks, little Deeks.

00:45.001 --> 00:45.958
:
I love you.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.047
DEEKS:
I love you.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.222
KENSI:
I love you.

00:48.265 --> 00:52.139
♪ I have loved you
for the last time ♪

00:52.182 --> 00:55.620
♪ Visions of Gideon

00:55.664 --> 00:56.621
♪ Visions of Gideon...

00:56.665 --> 00:57.840
KENSI:
Deeks!

01:24.910 --> 01:27.174
Where's my son?

01:27.217 --> 01:29.567
Where is my son?!

01:31.047 --> 01:32.570
Was he in there?

01:37.053 --> 01:40.187
WILLIAMS:
Is he in there?

01:41.927 --> 01:43.146
Move.

01:50.153 --> 01:51.328
Check their pockets.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.862
Kens?

02:03.906 --> 02:07.127
Kens.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.606
WILLIAMS:
Give me that cell phone.

02:08.650 --> 02:09.607
Where's Deeks?

02:09.651 --> 02:11.522
Deeks!

02:11.566 --> 02:14.308
Deeks! Aah! Deeks!

02:14.351 --> 02:15.309
Where is my son?

02:20.357 --> 02:22.054
I'll ask once more,

02:22.098 --> 02:23.708
then I put a bullet in her head.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.797
Where is my son?

02:28.278 --> 02:29.323
Kill her.

02:30.585 --> 02:33.196
Wait.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.502
Who is this?

02:36.112 --> 02:38.158
Local. Runs a
rental business.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.255
This what you're looking for?

02:53.390 --> 02:54.826
Let's do business.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.655
Derrick?

02:57.699 --> 03:00.354
His mouth's taped shut with C4.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.921
Dead man's switch.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.227
Shoot me, the boy dies.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.228
No need for that.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.621
How much do you want?

03:06.664 --> 03:08.318
Four of them for the boy.
We get five miles out,

03:08.362 --> 03:10.755
put your son by the side
of the road, simple.

03:10.799 --> 03:11.930
You're not getting out
of here alive.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.454
Shut up. We'll do it.

03:16.457 --> 03:18.023
At least keep
one of them.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.721
Where are they
going to go?

03:19.764 --> 03:20.939
Send 'em.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.819
You want the dead one?

03:30.862 --> 03:32.255
I got a stretcher in the back.
Send your men to get it.

03:32.299 --> 03:36.216
Okay. All right, baby.

03:38.609 --> 03:39.654
SAM:
Who's in the bag?

03:42.265 --> 03:43.310
Meet Deogey.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.140
How is he?
KENSI:
Not good.

03:48.184 --> 03:49.664
It's a bad head wound,
but he's breathing.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.976
Left.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.459
There's our ride.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.461
TURK:
We're not home yet.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.202
Vásquez is just letting us
out on a leash.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.858
Chopper's
not even running.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.164
Let's get these guys
out of the back.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.474
TURK:
Fire her up!

04:17.518 --> 04:18.693
Hey, we got to go!

04:24.525 --> 04:27.136
Hey!

04:31.575 --> 04:33.490
Take cover!

04:33.534 --> 04:34.752
Go, go, go.

04:38.408 --> 04:40.845
Up here. There.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.020
Got it, got it,
got it, yeah, yeah.

04:54.032 --> 04:56.034
Vásquez is never letting us
out of here.

04:56.078 --> 04:57.166
They're just pinning us down!

04:57.209 --> 04:59.342
They must still think
we have the kid.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.822
You have a knife?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.392
I'll try circling around.Careful.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.398
If they saw the dog, they could
put two and two together,

05:11.441 --> 05:13.661
figure out we don't
have the kid.
Then they would
be trying to kill us.

05:15.619 --> 05:18.230
He's got a rocket launcher!Not again.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.276
Incoming!

05:29.024 --> 05:30.417
Guess they saw the dog.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.420
♪

05:39.251 --> 05:40.252
Don't return fire.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.297
Make 'em think we're dead?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.429
Might get 'em to move.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.105
Admiral Hollace
Kilbride,

06:50.148 --> 06:51.889
Technical Operator
Eric Beale.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.456
Admiral.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.197
What a nice surprise.
Are you passing through town?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.852
We both wish. I'm here
because you all

06:57.895 --> 07:00.289
are up to your ass
in alligators.Hetty called him.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.899
You dress like
this for work?

07:01.943 --> 07:02.944
Yeah.  No.

07:02.987 --> 07:05.033
Where's Henrietta?

07:05.076 --> 07:07.601
That's funny you should ask
because she did call you,

07:07.644 --> 07:09.341
but, um, if you know
Hetty, then...

07:09.385 --> 07:11.561
You have no idea
where she is, do you?

07:11.605 --> 07:12.736
That's correct.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.739
So this is a complete
cluster... bomb.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.828
Oh, you can curse
in front of me, sir.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.569
Yeah, we talk
like sailors in here.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.267
Not that he's insinuating
sailors are prone to profanity.

07:22.311 --> 07:23.573
No, just pirates.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.270
Pirates. Pirates. Arr.
Arr.

07:25.314 --> 07:28.273
Get me Executive Assistant
Director Mosley on the horn

07:28.317 --> 07:29.753
and find Hetty.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.102
Yup. On it.

07:31.146 --> 07:34.236
And you, Point Break,
give me a sitrep.

07:34.279 --> 07:37.544
Well, this map shows
their last known location.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.286
Hi.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.638
MOSLEY:
Hetty?

07:44.681 --> 07:46.770
ERIC:
EAD Mosley, you're on.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.119
Are they out?

07:48.163 --> 07:49.991
No, they are not out.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.123
In fact, we're not even certain
if they're still alive.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.473
Who the hell is this?

07:53.516 --> 07:54.822
Who the hell this is

07:54.865 --> 07:57.259
is Admiral Hollace Kilbride,
Assistant Director.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.435
And you are
in a world of trouble.What happened?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.437
Your team's vehicle
was hit by a rocket.

08:03.221 --> 08:06.181
Did any of them survive?

08:06.224 --> 08:09.793
You ever seen a car
hit by a LAW rocket?

08:09.837 --> 08:12.796
Probably not.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.409
Are you there?

08:17.453 --> 08:19.542
Assistant Director?Yes, I'm here.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.806
On the off chance that
any of them did survive,

08:22.850 --> 08:24.373
I need you to coordinate

08:24.416 --> 08:25.548
getting the first pilot
back out.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.550
Are we leaving?
Not yet.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.509
What about the second
exfil pilot?

08:29.552 --> 08:31.423
We haven't been able
to get in touch with him.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.208
I'm trying to get my son
on a chartered flight.

08:33.251 --> 08:37.125
And we have four, maybe five
dead agents because of it,

08:37.168 --> 08:40.128
so I don't care how you do it,
but you get it done

08:40.171 --> 08:41.738
or you're gonna be wishing
you were in that car

08:41.782 --> 08:42.783
with the rest of your team.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.350
Are we clear

08:45.394 --> 08:46.047
MAN:
Señora Mosley.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.135
I got to go.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.224
Mosley. Por favor, abre la puerta.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.096
DERRICK:
Mom, what's going on?

08:53.620 --> 08:56.318
Where is Hetty?I'm sure Nell will be
in with her any minute.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.580
You got coffee?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.800
Yes, but we're not
allowed to drink in...

08:59.843 --> 09:01.845
Cream and sugar?
Black.

09:01.889 --> 09:04.021
Be right back.

09:04.065 --> 09:06.241
TURK: Chopper's fuel tank
is punctured

09:06.284 --> 09:07.503
and drained.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.244
Sat phone's done.

09:09.287 --> 09:10.419
What about the cells?

09:10.462 --> 09:12.421
Nothing.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.858
Vásquez probably shut
the cell towers down.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.077
How's she looking?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.905
Leaking oil and gas.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.297
Might be losing air
in the tires.

09:19.341 --> 09:20.864
Well, somebody should take
it as far as it'll go.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.126
I mean, it'll take two.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.825
You guys go.
You know I'm not leaving him.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.261
What about you?

09:26.304 --> 09:27.436
I know this desert.
I can make my way out of here.

09:27.479 --> 09:28.655
Where are you headed?

09:28.698 --> 09:30.570
It's safer for me
if you don't know that.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.354
Oh, you think
we're gonna get caught?

09:32.397 --> 09:34.051
Well, both of you
can barely walk.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.140
Bike's not gonna make it
more than 20 miles.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.881
As long as they don't
find me or the dog...

09:37.925 --> 09:39.317
They'll think Derrick
might still be alive.

09:39.361 --> 09:42.146
Deogey and I need to disappear.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.540
That's what's gonna keep us
all alive a little bit longer.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.542
We're not leaving them.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.805
Just a big, old love fest, huh?

09:48.849 --> 09:50.459
KENSI:
Guys, get out of here.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.461
I'm the only one who can
carry this stretcher.

09:52.504 --> 09:53.767
We'll find a
place to hide.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.333
Look, best bet,
head straight south.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.944
If you're lucky,
there's a small village

09:56.987 --> 09:58.119
that doesn't even
have a name,

09:58.162 --> 09:59.468
but somebody there
may be nice enough

09:59.511 --> 10:00.556
to take you to a hospital.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.688
Here, take some water.

10:01.731 --> 10:02.776
It's all I got.

10:02.819 --> 10:03.951
Thank you.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.648
Better get going.

10:05.692 --> 10:10.914
I'll take my knife,
one of these rifles.

10:13.308 --> 10:16.137
You're the one that wanted
to come to Mexico.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.400
All three of these plans
are awful.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.708
Sucks to be us.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.671
Sutures must have opened up.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.717
Like the man said,
it sucks to be us.

11:34.563 --> 11:35.912
Come on!

11:54.322 --> 11:56.759
No more gas.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.848
Should get it off the road
and out of sight.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.853
You okay?
Yeah, just having
a little trouble breathing.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.202
You might've cracked a rib.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.769
Let me hide this,
then I'll take a look at it.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.249
You got to get off your feet.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.686
Look who's talking.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.651
Martin Deeks,

12:19.695 --> 12:22.524
if you are faking this,
I will kill you myself.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.352
Come on, baby.

12:34.231 --> 12:36.712
Come on, sweetie.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.454
Oh, come on.

12:39.497 --> 12:42.152
You know what?
If you wake up right now,

12:42.196 --> 12:44.459
I will have sex
with you right here.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.330
Hot desert sex,
just think about that.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.550
Hot desert sex.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.639
:
Baby, wake up.

12:56.645 --> 12:57.820
DEEKS:
Desert sex?

12:57.864 --> 12:58.908
I think that's
gonna be

12:58.952 --> 13:00.431
getting us pretty sunburned

13:00.475 --> 13:01.781
in all of our vulnerable parts.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.739
Don't you think?

13:11.921 --> 13:13.923
Damn it, Deeks.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.840
That was not funny.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.321
I'm definitely not
having sex with you now.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.453
Let's go.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.196
This is crazy.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.895
You're unconscious
and I'm still fighting with you.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.332
Ow.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.812
What about here?
Ow!

13:32.855 --> 13:34.552
How about here?Ow. Okay.

13:34.596 --> 13:35.858
Now you're just doing this
on purpose.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.642
I think you broke
a couple of ribs.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.166
We got to get off
this road.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.428
Help me get up, will you?

13:40.471 --> 13:43.170
Let me get up first.Easy.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.694
Oh, God.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.696
Sam.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.093
We're gonna be
in a lot of trouble

13:53.136 --> 13:54.572
if he tells anybody
we're here.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.314
Yeah, we can't
let him get away.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.489
He's gonna run.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.230
Hola.

14:00.274 --> 14:01.144
¿Hablas inglés?

14:01.188 --> 14:02.842
Wait!
Aah!

14:06.541 --> 14:08.325
That's got to hurt.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.591
Come on, all right?

14:13.635 --> 14:15.855
Aah! He bit me! Look.

14:18.945 --> 14:19.989
Think I'm starting
to like this kid.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.122
We're not gonna
get far with him.

14:22.165 --> 14:24.428
Well, we weren't gonna
get very far anyway.

14:25.473 --> 14:26.909
He had to come from somewhere.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.089
That was a good talk.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.091
Come on, we got
to get out of here.

14:35.135 --> 14:37.006
Let's get off
this road. Come on.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.139
Let's go.I'll get the gun.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.321
Aah! Stop biting me!

14:48.583 --> 14:50.759
Okay?

14:52.500 --> 14:55.068
¿Comprende?

14:55.111 --> 14:56.460
Come on.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.771
More coffee, sir?

15:02.814 --> 15:03.859
You people call this coffee?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.600
You don't like hazelnut?

15:05.643 --> 15:08.559
I asked for coffee, not dessert.
God, I hate California.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.039
And please
don't tell me

15:10.083 --> 15:13.173
you still haven't found
your operations manager.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.304
I'm sorry, sir,
we've looked everywhere,

15:14.348 --> 15:15.784
but now she's
turned her phone off.

15:15.827 --> 15:19.048
Well, knowing Hetty,
she's commandeered a SEAL team

15:19.092 --> 15:20.441
to drop her into Mexico.

15:20.484 --> 15:24.271
Any further word
from EAD Mosley?

15:24.314 --> 15:26.969
Uh, no, we can't reach her
by phone or comms.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.666
And the human remains?

15:28.710 --> 15:30.190
Well, they haven't been
positively identified

15:30.233 --> 15:31.931
as Agent Hidoko's, so...

15:31.974 --> 15:33.149
She could
still be alive.

15:33.193 --> 15:34.846
Yeah.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.178
Oh, hey, sweetie.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.793
Why's your hand so cold, bud?

16:08.837 --> 16:10.839
Babe?

16:12.319 --> 16:15.365
Why are you so cold? It's like
a hundred degrees outside.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.373
We'll just stay here and
rest for a while, okay?

16:23.417 --> 16:25.201
We'll just sleep.

16:25.245 --> 16:28.683
I realize that's all you've
been doing.

16:31.555 --> 16:34.210
You know I can carry you
through this desert.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.213
I can do that.

16:40.608 --> 16:44.699
But I really need you
to open your eyes right now.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.966
I really need you
to wake up, baby.

16:54.056 --> 16:58.191
Baby, just, just open your eyes
for one minute,

16:58.234 --> 17:00.454
then you can rest, okay?

17:05.589 --> 17:10.377
'Cause I can carry you anywhere.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.032
I'll carry you
for the rest of your life.

17:15.773 --> 17:18.080
But I really need you
to wake up.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.432
I really need you
to open your eyes

17:22.476 --> 17:24.304
and tell me it's gonna be okay.

17:27.959 --> 17:31.441
Please, baby.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.052
Please wake up.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.533
Please, please, God,
just help him wake up. Please.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.207
I can't go
any further.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.428
Okay.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.365
Let me see.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.846
Think your rib
punctured your lung.

18:28.890 --> 18:32.285
It's collapsing from the air
inside your chest cavity.

18:32.328 --> 18:35.114
If I could find a tube
or pen and a knife,

18:35.157 --> 18:36.332
I could, uh,
cut a hole,

18:36.376 --> 18:38.334
push it in between there
and let the air out.

18:38.378 --> 18:39.683
That sounds fun.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.342
You okay?

18:50.172 --> 18:53.349
Just give me a sec.

18:53.393 --> 18:56.570
I was feeling
a little light-headed.

18:56.613 --> 19:00.139
You're losing too much blood.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.101
It's just a matter of time

19:06.145 --> 19:08.016
before one of us goes down.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.549
Hey.Hi.

19:20.594 --> 19:21.943
Open your eyes, please.

19:21.986 --> 19:24.511
DEEKS:
What happened to the baby?

19:24.554 --> 19:25.729
KENSI:
Open your eyes, please.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.688
Where's the baby?Deeks, open your eyes.

19:27.731 --> 19:30.517
Where's the baby?Deeks, I need you to open
your eyes and look at me.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.432
I need you to come back to me.
Please open your eyes.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.216
Open your eyes, please.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.739
My eyes are open.
What happened to the baby?

19:35.783 --> 19:37.219
Deeks, open your eyes.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.439
Where's the baby?Come back to me.

19:39.482 --> 19:40.962
What happened to the baby?

19:43.094 --> 19:46.272
You're awake. You're awake.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.321
Where am I?

19:52.365 --> 19:54.280
Oh, you're gonna be okay.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.238
We're gonna be,
we're gonna be fine.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.066
We're gonna be fine now.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.068
What happened?

20:00.111 --> 20:02.070
Well, we're in Mexico.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.985
Like Cabo?

20:04.028 --> 20:07.206
N-No, honey,
we're not in Cabo at all.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.208
Oh, my God, I love you.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.471
Oh.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.473
My God, there's something
wrong with my head.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.126
Yeah.Baby, what happened?

20:15.170 --> 20:18.042
It's a concussion.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.349
We were all in a car
that got hit by a rocket.

20:22.133 --> 20:24.092
What, are you okay?

20:24.135 --> 20:25.267
Yeah, I'm okay.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.227
Something's not right.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.274
I think I should probably
be at a hospital.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.363
Yeah, Callen and Sam
already went for help.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.409
Who?

20:36.452 --> 20:38.933
Callen and Sam.

20:38.976 --> 20:42.241
Oh, my gosh, Deeks,

20:42.284 --> 20:45.287
can-- Deeks...

20:45.331 --> 20:47.028
I'm kidding.

20:47.071 --> 20:48.769
I love that you're
trying to be funny.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.075
That's a good sign.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.165
I'm sorry.

20:54.209 --> 20:58.387
Where are we? Are we in a ch...
are we in a church?

20:58.431 --> 20:59.867
Yeah, I guess we are.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.303
That means we can't
have sex, right?

21:02.609 --> 21:03.740
Probably would have made
my head feel better.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.525
Probably...

21:05.568 --> 21:09.355
...help my...
brain from bleeding.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.795
I had this dream
that you were pregnant.Really?

21:14.838 --> 21:15.796
What did I look like?

21:15.839 --> 21:19.321
You looked really fat.

21:27.155 --> 21:29.679
No, you looked amazing.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.992
You looked so beautiful.

21:41.996 --> 21:44.477
You looked so
beautiful.

21:55.270 --> 22:00.231
Getting harder...
to breathe.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.366
If I had a knife, I could
cut a hole in your chest...

22:04.410 --> 22:07.238
...release some
of the air.

22:08.718 --> 22:11.068
Hold it open
with my finger.

22:12.461 --> 22:13.897
That's the best
you got for me?

22:15.595 --> 22:16.987
I'm gonna try to find help.

22:17.031 --> 22:19.250
You can't walk.

22:19.294 --> 22:20.339
You barely made it in here.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.517
I'm not losing you, too.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.910
I can't.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.738
I'll be back.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.350
Hey, wait! Hey!

22:46.756 --> 22:49.672
The kid got away.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.413
He's gonna be back here
soon with people.

22:51.457 --> 22:54.068
Cheer up.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.374
We've been in worse jams.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.940
When?

22:56.984 --> 23:00.553
Shot... five times.

23:00.596 --> 23:03.469
I'm bleeding out from a
gunshot wound right now.

23:03.512 --> 23:06.341
Yeah.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.125
Yeah, what?

23:11.477 --> 23:15.263
This is the worst.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.743
You're right.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.832
Oh, my goodness,

23:18.875 --> 23:22.270
it takes us both dying
for you to admit I'm right.

23:22.313 --> 23:24.141
That's so messed up, G.

23:27.710 --> 23:31.801
We had a good ru--
good run.

23:35.501 --> 23:36.545
Helped a lot of people.

23:43.683 --> 23:47.034
I-I can't... talk anymore.

23:47.077 --> 23:50.777
It's okay. Rest.

23:50.820 --> 23:54.084
Rest, brother.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.304
Deeks, can you open your eyes?Mm...

23:56.347 --> 23:58.654
Kens. What?

23:58.698 --> 24:01.396
We need to keep moving.
Okay.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.615
Do you think you can stand up?

24:02.658 --> 24:03.964
Absolutely.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.531
Okay.

24:08.838 --> 24:12.102
Okay.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.017
How does that feel?

24:16.542 --> 24:18.413
God, I'm so dizzy, I feel
like I'm gonna throw up.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.156
What is that?

24:24.114 --> 24:26.334
I'll go and check it out.
Just lie back down.

24:26.377 --> 24:27.640
No, baby, hold on
a second.

24:33.167 --> 24:36.257
It's a guy on a motorcycle.
He might have a cell phone.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.998
Okay, I'll go.
Hold on, baby. Hold...

24:38.041 --> 24:39.869
KENSI: Hola.MAN: Hola.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.270
Okay. Gracias.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.373
Gracias.

25:09.899 --> 25:12.467
Okay...

25:12.511 --> 25:14.469
so, the guy has a motorcycle.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.297
He said he can take you
to the nearest hospital.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.907
You have to go...

25:28.091 --> 25:31.225
You are American.

25:31.268 --> 25:34.228
I thought it might be
the two of you.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.708
There's a bounty on your heads.

25:36.839 --> 25:40.800
General Vásquez, right?

25:40.843 --> 25:43.803
There are trucks all over
the roads looking for you.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.369
It's like a contest out there.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.245
Oh, no, no, don't worry.

25:51.288 --> 25:54.117
This is just for hunting
white-wing doves.

25:54.161 --> 25:57.599
I was going to camp out

25:57.643 --> 25:59.906
and go hunting in the morning
after the sun came up.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.473
Just relax.

26:02.517 --> 26:05.302
My wife will be here soon.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.190
Okay, babe.I'm good.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.626
I'm okay.

26:24.670 --> 26:25.888
Yeah.
Oh...

26:25.932 --> 26:27.629
Francisco, could we try
your phone again?

26:27.673 --> 26:28.804
There's a lot of people
worried about us.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.240
Of course, of course.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.852
Ah, uh, my battery just died.

26:32.895 --> 26:35.419
I-I'm so sorry.
Okay.

26:35.463 --> 26:38.161
When do you think your
wife's gonna get here?Any minute.

26:38.205 --> 26:40.990
Unless something went wrong
and she sent me a text,

26:41.034 --> 26:43.514
and I didn't get it.

26:43.558 --> 26:46.387
Right. Well, is there
anyone else around here?

26:46.430 --> 26:48.998
AThere used to be.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.652
When I was a child.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.306
There were a lot more
people back then.

26:52.349 --> 26:54.438
You know, it's funny.

26:54.482 --> 26:58.442
When I was a little boy,
I used to think this church

26:58.486 --> 27:00.140
is where I would work
when I grew up.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.837
You wanted to be a priest?

27:01.881 --> 27:04.057
I was a priest.What happened?

27:04.100 --> 27:08.148
I was a little too outspoken
for the cartels.

27:08.191 --> 27:10.977
And then I fell in love.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.413
That'll get you every time.

27:12.456 --> 27:15.721
Ah, my wife.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.992
FRANCISCO:
You know, I could marry
the two of you.

27:26.035 --> 27:29.299
I still have my credentials
for civil marriages.

27:29.343 --> 27:31.519
I mean, I don't know
if you guys

27:31.562 --> 27:33.695
are even thinking
about getting married.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.741
Somebody likes the idea.

27:39.396 --> 27:40.659
You could really do it?

27:40.702 --> 27:42.095
Well, he would have to
be conscious, though.

27:44.227 --> 27:46.099
You guys should
get married.

27:53.846 --> 27:54.934
G.

27:58.459 --> 28:00.983
Come on, stay with
me, buddy. Hey!

28:12.734 --> 28:14.388
I think you need this.

28:14.431 --> 28:15.694
A pen, right?

28:15.737 --> 28:17.347
Thank you.

28:17.391 --> 28:19.088
I need a knife.

28:19.132 --> 28:20.220
A knife. Un cuchillo.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.917
Un cuchillo. Cuchillo.

Come on.

You with me?
All right.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.690
Thanks.
Gracias.

29:02.262 --> 29:03.611
You saved my friend.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.482
I'm sorry I bit you.

29:06.919 --> 29:08.224
What's your name?

29:08.268 --> 29:09.965
Samuel.Samuel.

29:10.009 --> 29:13.795

Papá!

29:31.770 --> 29:33.032
Miguel.

Where are we going?

29:51.398 --> 29:53.313
Los Mochis.Los Mochis?

29:53.356 --> 29:54.836
This is the road--To General Vásquez's compound.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.838
I'm sorry.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.100
You're worth
too much money.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.542
No!

30:24.344 --> 30:27.216
Deeks.
Deeks!

30:59.466 --> 31:01.250
Okay,

31:01.294 --> 31:02.861
the plan didn't suck completely.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.341
Don't get too excited.
It ain't over.

31:05.385 --> 31:06.995
Got to get you out of here.
Can you walk?

31:07.039 --> 31:09.780
That doesn't help me.

31:09.824 --> 31:12.174
Guess it's all about you.What about Callen?

31:12.218 --> 31:13.784
He's worse than me.

31:21.618 --> 31:22.706
Ayuda! Ayuda!

31:22.750 --> 31:23.620
Ayúdame!

31:23.664 --> 31:25.927
Come on, baby. Oh, I got you.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.842
It's okay. We got you.

31:36.503 --> 31:37.808
Hey.

31:37.852 --> 31:41.551
Wh... hey.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.249
Glad you made it.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.641
Yeah.
You okay?

31:47.862 --> 31:50.734
Yes, you are.
He's alive.

31:52.345 --> 31:54.521
You did that.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.355
DOCTOR:
The CT scan shows

32:02.398 --> 32:04.139
that there is swelling
in his brain.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.315
Because of his concussion,
the second blow

32:06.359 --> 32:08.274
was just about the worst thing
that could have happened to him.

32:08.317 --> 32:09.971
For right now we just
have to wait and see.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.407
Can he be moved?
No.

32:11.451 --> 32:12.669
He needs to be monitored.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.236
He needs a repeat scan
in six hours.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.586
What about with a medevac
and a trauma team on board?

32:16.630 --> 32:19.328
That could be okay, but I'd
still prefer to keep him here.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.722
Okay, thank you.
Thank you so much.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.033
You know what's
really dangerous?

32:29.469 --> 32:31.079
Not moving him.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.560
Spoke to Hetty,
but the problem is

32:33.603 --> 32:35.301
Williams and Vásquez
are not gonna stop.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.433
They know your team had
to get to a hospital.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.479
They're gonna be
looking for us.What did Hetty say?

32:39.522 --> 32:41.655
She said she might know
a couple people willing to help,

32:41.698 --> 32:44.005
some agent named Gonzalez.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.659
The operative word
being "might."

32:45.702 --> 32:47.443
Thanks.
Cover your weapon.

32:47.487 --> 32:50.881
How long till
they get here?

32:50.925 --> 32:53.188
She was hoping
a couple hours.

32:53.232 --> 32:55.451
Look, I don't know
who they are.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.758
I don't know how
many are coming.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.978
They see us overwhelmed,
they could turn and walk.

33:00.021 --> 33:05.070
As far as I'm concerned,
we're on our own.

33:08.116 --> 33:10.423
Hey, don't hide your
weapon too much.

33:10.466 --> 33:12.947
We want them to think that we're
just the first line of defense.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.297
KENSI: Maybe they'll hold off
until Hetty's people get here.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.649
Check out the black Honda.

33:22.391 --> 33:24.045
Those are Williams' men.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.960
Hired cartel members.
That's a good sign.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.441
How do you figure that
that's a good sign?

33:28.484 --> 33:30.443
'Cause General Vásquez doesn't
have any skin in the game.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.445
He's making Williams deal
with his own problems.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.925
Guess it's better than the
Mexican military assaulting us.

33:37.189 --> 33:38.973
Four more.

33:41.802 --> 33:44.239
KENSI:
Honda's back.
That makes eight.

33:44.283 --> 33:46.285
TURK:
All heavily armed.

33:48.983 --> 33:52.378
Let's see who blinks first.

33:52.421 --> 33:53.988
Signaling our imaginary backup,
are we?

33:54.032 --> 33:56.556
Got to make 'em believe.

33:57.861 --> 34:00.299
And that makes 12.

34:00.342 --> 34:01.648
Okay.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.824
Hey, smile like
I just told you a joke.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.701
See? It's all good.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.399
Yeah.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.536
Until it's not.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.428
This is
between me and you.

34:42.471 --> 34:45.126
Pull your men from the hospital
and we can talk about it.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.649
You haven't aged
a day, Shay.

34:46.693 --> 34:49.043
Do you...

34:49.087 --> 34:51.524
Pull your men from the hospital.

34:51.567 --> 34:54.135
You don't want the attention,
and neither do we.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.529
Let's figure out what's best
for our son.

34:56.572 --> 34:57.965
No.

35:00.185 --> 35:03.013
Spencer, you're
running out of men.

35:21.771 --> 35:22.816
They're not buying it.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.132
Signal our
imaginary friends again.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.051
I don't think they have
a very good imagination.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.662
All right. They're coming.
Take cover.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.645
You tell 'em to back off.

36:09.689 --> 36:12.431
You're never going
to give me back my son,

36:12.474 --> 36:13.823
so why should I?

36:43.331 --> 36:44.898
Hetty.

36:44.941 --> 36:47.074
Pick up the damn phone, Hetty.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.911
Take them out.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.574
You pick up that walkie

37:08.617 --> 37:10.837
and you explain to them
that he's dead.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.709
Nobody's getting paid today.

37:13.753 --> 37:16.843
And you make sure they back the
hell away from that hospital.

37:18.888 --> 37:20.542
Now!

37:21.761 --> 37:23.066
HETTY:
Hello.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.503
We're out of time.
How far out's your cavalry?

37:24.546 --> 37:26.809
Minutes.We have seconds.

37:33.207 --> 37:34.904
What the hell?

37:34.948 --> 37:37.733
Why are they retreating?
Something happened.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.287
Who the hell
are these guys?

38:11.550 --> 38:12.899
Let's find out.

38:12.942 --> 38:16.337
Identify yourselves
or you're dead!

38:16.381 --> 38:18.600
Special Agent Diego Gonzalez,
friend of Hetty's.

38:18.644 --> 38:20.298
You are NCIS
Special Agents Arlo Turk,

38:20.341 --> 38:22.387
Kensi Blye.

38:25.259 --> 38:27.130
NCIS?

38:27.174 --> 38:29.742
We all have our flaws.

38:29.785 --> 38:31.134
That's us.

38:31.178 --> 38:32.962
You're late.

38:33.006 --> 38:35.922
We got medical evac helos
with doctors on board.

38:35.965 --> 38:39.099
We're gonna move everybody to
Balboa Naval Hospital right now.

38:39.142 --> 38:41.101
I guess you're forgiven then.

38:41.144 --> 38:42.798
Let's go.

38:42.842 --> 38:45.758
MAN:
It's over.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.760
I'll stay
till I see the helo take off.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.762
HETTY:
Now, I know you don't believe
in God,

38:49.805 --> 38:52.765
but I need you to pray for them.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.419
It's all I've been doing
the last two days.

38:54.462 --> 38:55.594
Well, that makes two of us.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.291
Thank you.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.685
See you in a few.

39:17.703 --> 39:18.704
How are they?

39:18.747 --> 39:19.835
Everyone is stable.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.489
Deeks and Sam are conscious.

39:21.533 --> 39:23.883
Callen's got a long way to go.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.798
A punctured lung,
internal bleeding,

39:25.841 --> 39:27.887
and fractured vertebra.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.889
And your son?

39:29.932 --> 39:32.282
My son is back in L.A.
with family.

39:32.326 --> 39:33.545
From what I hear,

39:33.588 --> 39:35.024
the father won't be a problem.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.286
Is that what you hear?

39:36.330 --> 39:38.158
Found in a car
with two other dead bodies.

39:38.201 --> 39:39.551
You've gotten everything
you wanted.

39:39.594 --> 39:42.031
You make this sound
like a wish list on Amazon.

39:42.075 --> 39:43.685
I did what I had to do

39:43.729 --> 39:45.470
to get my son back.

39:45.513 --> 39:46.993
I hope you understand the cost.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.734
I don't have to have
this conversation with you.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.388
Yes, you do.

39:50.431 --> 39:54.479
Of course I understand the cost.

39:54.522 --> 39:55.697
But it was worth it.

39:59.005 --> 40:01.877
Good night, Mosley.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.365
NELL:
Admiral?

40:11.409 --> 40:13.585
You got confirmation.

40:13.628 --> 40:16.022
The lab just called.

40:16.065 --> 40:18.241
The remains were
Agent Hidoko's.

40:21.549 --> 40:22.768
She was, what, 26, 27?

40:22.811 --> 40:25.379
Twenty-seven.
Twenty-seven.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.947
She was a brave
young woman.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.383
She never should have
gone down there.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.907
None of your people should have
gone down there.

40:34.301 --> 40:36.521
I will need to speak
with her family.

40:37.565 --> 40:40.394
Isn't that something
Mosley should do?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.614
There's lots of things
Mosley should've done.

40:42.657 --> 40:44.529
Uh-huh.

40:44.572 --> 40:45.965
I'll get you
the contact info.

41:08.988 --> 41:11.120
:
Hey.

41:12.165 --> 41:14.210
Hi.

41:14.254 --> 41:15.734
Hi.

41:15.777 --> 41:17.257
Does anything hurt?

41:17.300 --> 41:18.476
You okay? You
need anything?

41:19.955 --> 41:23.829
Yeah, I need an aspirin like
the size of a basketball.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.179
Sure.

41:26.222 --> 41:28.921
Maybe a sponge bath?

41:37.059 --> 41:39.671
Should get some
rest, okay?
No.

41:39.714 --> 41:41.977
Listen, I need
to be with you.

41:46.068 --> 41:49.028
I was wrong. I want to,
I want to marry you.

41:51.596 --> 41:52.901
And if you marry me,

41:52.945 --> 41:54.207
I swear to God,
I will give you

41:54.250 --> 41:55.513
everything I have
in this life.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.649
I love you so much.

42:03.651 --> 42:05.305
I don't want to do
this without you.

42:05.348 --> 42:09.570
: And I will give you
everything I have in this life.

42:14.096 --> 42:15.576
I love you.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.622
I love you.
