WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.360
WATER DRIPS

00:09.200 --> 00:11.280
SHE SIGHS

00:20.920 --> 00:23.040
SHE SIGHS

00:53.800 --> 00:57.000
Quick! Hurry! Quick! In!

00:57.000 --> 00:59.240
Come on! Hurry up.

01:01.320 --> 01:05.360
This is Matron's book. I found it
in the dorm over the holiday.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.840
You are going to be in
so much trouble.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.480
Picture this. Cecile is a nurse
in the French Resistance,

01:11.480 --> 01:13.840
but she's fallen for
a British soldier,

01:13.840 --> 01:17.640
the impossibly handsome
Captain Forsyth!

01:17.640 --> 01:20.200
"I lay dazed in the ruins
for a moment,

01:20.200 --> 01:23.720
"until a hand reached in
and pulled me to safety.

01:23.720 --> 01:28.280
"The face staring back at me,
it was my captain.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.160
"He'd come back to rescue me."

01:30.160 --> 01:32.600
THEY LAUGH

01:33.760 --> 01:36.080
Who knew nature could be so mushy?

01:38.320 --> 01:41.440
Sally! Come join us. Alicia was
just reading... My French prep.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.640
Lousy as usual.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.520
You didn't miss anything.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.800
Not so fast. I have your letters
from home,

01:50.800 --> 01:53.320
although I have a good mind
to confiscate the lot.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.840
Why's that?

01:54.840 --> 01:58.560
Because word has reached me of
an illicit midnight feast

01:58.560 --> 02:00.160
in the North Tower.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.920
That's not us, Matron.
I do not want to hear your excuses.

02:02.920 --> 02:07.800
Just know that I will be clamping
down on behaviour from now on.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.040
If you so much as sneeze,
I will know about it.

02:11.040 --> 02:14.480
Do you understand?
ALL: Yes, Matron.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.160
Sally Hope, pass these out.

02:16.160 --> 02:19.880
And if Gwendoline Mary Lacey
ever deigns to show her face,

02:19.880 --> 02:22.800
be sure to pass on my warning.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.200
ALL: Yes, Matron.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.880
Oh, Ellen! You're just in time.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.960
I was hoping for somewhere quiet
to study.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.320
Alicia's about to unveil
one of her legendary pranks.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.200
Why would you want to play tricks
on the teachers?

02:59.200 --> 03:02.360
Because the lessons here
would be dreadfully dull otherwise?

03:04.520 --> 03:06.480
It's a piece of foreign chalk.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.200
Maybe it explodes?

03:11.560 --> 03:13.960
It doesn't leave a mark.
Let me try.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.240
Why couldn't he have sent me
a stink bomb or a catapult?

03:25.240 --> 03:27.240
Maybe it's just as well, Alicia.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.560
We don't want to get into
any more trouble with Matron.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.200
Becoming head of form has made you
a real stick in the mud, Sally.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.480
Don't be unkind. Sally is just
trying to look out for us.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.720
That's all.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.440
My French prep has been ruined,

03:37.440 --> 03:39.960
all because of that stupid leak
in the roof.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.840
This is worse than living through
the Blitz.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.440
Perhaps you should tell Matron,
Gwen.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.560
She's in a particularly good mood
this morning.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.960
I think I'll do just that,
because if Mother knew about

03:48.960 --> 03:52.360
the inhumane conditions
I was having to... Gwen...

03:52.360 --> 03:56.160
Not now, Darrell Rivers.
I've had a very trying morning!

03:56.160 --> 03:58.880
Look at the back of your dress!
LAUGHTER

03:58.880 --> 04:01.520
Look! It must be the chalk.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.920
But why doesn't it leave a mark
on the chair?

04:03.920 --> 04:06.160
It must be triggered by body heat.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.160
You, Darrell Rivers, have ruined
a perfectly good dress!

04:09.160 --> 04:11.560
Well, I'm sure it comes off...
Now you're trying to beat me!

04:11.560 --> 04:12.880
I'm trying to make it clean.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.760
I didn't realise the chalk
was invisible.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.520
You know what this means, right?

04:16.520 --> 04:18.560
This is going to be the prank
to end all pranks.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.000
LAUGHTER

04:27.880 --> 04:29.640
I say we try the invisible chalk
on Matron.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.520
LAUGHS: She's likely to blow
a gasket!

04:31.520 --> 04:34.240
THEY LAUGH

04:34.240 --> 04:36.800
Well, we do know someone
who loves their Parisian silk!

04:36.800 --> 04:39.560
LAUGHS: Mam'zelle Rougier!

04:39.560 --> 04:42.160
You have any idea just how much
trouble you're both being?

04:42.160 --> 04:44.760
Then we'll just have to make sure
Mam'zelle doesn't find out!

04:44.760 --> 04:45.960
It's just a drip, Gwen...

04:45.960 --> 04:49.440
Is it any wonder I have a weak chest
after almost drowning this morning?

04:49.440 --> 04:53.080
SHE COUGHS

04:49.440 --> 04:53.080
Enough of that caterwauling.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.520
Isn't there something
you'd like to say to Matron, Gwen?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.000
Oh, I do, as it happens.

05:00.400 --> 05:05.520
Matron, I'd like to make
a formal complaint.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.800
The conditions in the dormitory,
they're unsanitary.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.960
I wouldn't be surprised
if I've contracted a typhoid

05:10.960 --> 05:13.840
with all that water dripping
from the ceiling.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.360
Talk about making a mountain
out of a molehill!

05:16.360 --> 05:18.320
What harm will a little drop
of water do?

05:18.320 --> 05:21.480
Now, get changed before I make up
a bed for you in the potting shed.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.600
LAUGHTER

05:28.680 --> 05:30.080
Is everything all right, Matron?

05:30.080 --> 05:34.000
Oh, just Gwendoline Mary Lacey
trying my patience as usual.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.600
You give these girls an inch,
they'll take a mile, Mr Parker.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.840
They are rather spirited.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.920
Which is why you need to be
much firmer with them.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.200
We can't have them leading you
a merry dance.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.120
Yes, I rather fear they might see
a new teacher

05:44.120 --> 05:45.360
as something of a soft touch.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.760
Then you need to come down harder on
them. Remind them who's in charge.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.040
These girls are here to learn.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.440
It's high time you reminded them
of that. Yes, of course.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.200
Well, perhaps we can discuss this
in more detail

05:56.200 --> 05:58.640
over an Eccles cake this lunchtime.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.560
I'd be honoured! Consider me putty
in your hands, Matron.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.560
Shall we say my office at 1.00?
Until then.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.360
Don't let Matron see you
reading that.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.440
Do you think Matron's ever
been in love?

06:10.440 --> 06:12.160
With Mr Parker?

06:12.160 --> 06:14.240
THEY GIGGLE

06:15.560 --> 06:17.640
LOUD CHATTER

06:20.760 --> 06:23.120
Everyone, everyone! What is that?

06:23.120 --> 06:24.560
Why, it's a hat, of course.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.520
Why is there a big D on it?

06:29.000 --> 06:33.280
Cos it must belong to someone
called Derek or Deidre?

06:33.280 --> 06:34.560
The D is for Dunce.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.840
I remember my grandmother
telling me about it.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.280
It was the most awful punishment,

06:38.280 --> 06:41.520
and people would point and stare
and say the most terrible things.

06:41.520 --> 06:48.200
Ah! I see you've acquainted
yourselves with the dunce's cap.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.120
Matron has raised concerns
about your behaviour.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.520
I, too, have noticed that some of
you have already started to

06:54.520 --> 06:56.600
fall behind on your studies.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.800
As your form teacher, it is
my responsibility to ensure

06:59.800 --> 07:03.360
that this is dealt with
as swiftly as possible.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.960
I will therefore be setting
a Latin test for you later today.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.920
Any girl who fails will have to wear
the dunce's cap.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.320
Is that understood?

07:21.880 --> 07:24.360
I didn't even study Latin
at my last school!

07:24.360 --> 07:26.360
Then I expect you'll be first
to wear the cap,

07:26.360 --> 07:28.360
shortly followed by Darrell Rivers,
of course.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.680
Why do you say that?

07:29.680 --> 07:34.400
Because you're bound to lose
that terrible temper of yours!

07:34.400 --> 07:36.520
You're not still planning
to do your trick, are you?

07:36.520 --> 07:38.000
Just try stopping me.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.320
What are you doing out of class?
I forgot my French prep.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.840
No, I need you to fetch
the caretaker.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.080
Tell him one of the pipes
in the ceiling is leaking.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.480
He needs to come up to
the dorm immediately.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.160
What are you waiting for?
Go on, then!

08:20.680 --> 08:25.560
Everyone, get out your prep.
I will collect it tout suite.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.560
I'm sorry, I had to go to the dorm,
but then Matron stopped me.

08:32.560 --> 08:35.520
Oh, gosh, I'm supposed to fetch
the caretaker.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.840
Enough with the histrionics.
Sit down this instant!

08:37.840 --> 08:40.440
Oh, no, I really do...

08:37.840 --> 08:40.440
MAM'ZELLE SPEAKS FRENCH

08:42.240 --> 08:45.360
I can collect the prep, Mam'zelle.
Merci beaucoup, Alicia.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.120
Mary-Lou.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.720
That's everyone's prep, Mam'zelle,
apart from yours, Gwen.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.080
What is this?

09:06.080 --> 09:09.880
Mam'zelle Rougier, I spent
all evening doing my prep,

09:09.880 --> 09:13.360
but then there was this terrible
leak in the ceiling above my bed.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.040
And, as you can see, all my
beautiful work has been smudged.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.480
MAM'ZELLE SIGHS

09:19.480 --> 09:21.480
Quel dommage.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.920
Then, of course, you will
stay behind and do it again.

09:24.920 --> 09:30.440
It would be a tragedy for me to
miss out on such magnificent work.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.200
I can't believe you just did that.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.680
What if you end up wearing the cap?

09:38.680 --> 09:40.240
You're such a scaredy cat, Mary-Lou.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.520
MAM'ZELLE SPEAKS FRENCH
What is wrong with you today, girls?

09:59.920 --> 10:02.880

10:23.440 --> 10:25.480
Where are you, you silly girl?

10:28.480 --> 10:30.120
Oh, Mr Parker.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.240
You think because I have
a generous disposition,

12:04.240 --> 12:07.200
you can get away with
this behaviour, no?

12:07.200 --> 12:09.760
I shall tell Monsieur Parker...

12:11.080 --> 12:13.840
..about this little outburst.

12:13.840 --> 12:14.880
Hm?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.920
Alle, alle!

12:20.280 --> 12:24.680
Pas si vite, Lacey!
You have work to finish.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.800
I can't wait to read
your beautiful work, Gwen!

12:31.880 --> 12:34.480
What if someone sees the chalk?
You're such a worrywart, Sally.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.440
It'll rub off as...

12:36.440 --> 12:38.800
..soon as she sits down.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.840
Mademoiselle Rougier!

Ah! Monsieur Parker.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.560
You have a...on your...

12:47.560 --> 12:49.160
What is it, Monsieur Parker?

12:49.160 --> 12:52.440
You seem a little flustered.
It's your skirt.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.800
How lovely of you to notice!

12:54.800 --> 12:56.880
It's the finest Parisian silk.
GIRLS GIGGLE

12:56.880 --> 12:58.080
No, it's your...

12:59.200 --> 13:02.560
Please excuse me, Mademoiselle.
I have a class to prepare for.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.120
Right, that's it.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.400
ALL: Hello, Mr Parker!
Girls...

13:10.400 --> 13:12.480
We're confiscating the chalk.
You can't do that.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.160
It belongs to my brother.
Sally's right!

13:14.160 --> 13:16.280
We can't risk getting into
any more trouble.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.440
Whose side are you on?

13:17.440 --> 13:20.160
I just want to see anyone
having to wear the dunce's cap.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.360
Who knew you were such
a party pooper, Darrell Rivers?

13:30.800 --> 13:33.760
There are rather a lot of puddles
on the floor.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.120
Did you not think to fetch
the caretaker?

13:36.120 --> 13:40.080
I am more than capable of
dealing with a silly little leak.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.840
Now run along to class, both of you!

14:20.080 --> 14:22.480
I'm scared I'm going to fail
Mr Parker's test.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.680
You just have to be
your usual brilliant self.

14:25.680 --> 14:30.360
It's just... Every time he asks
a question, I get all tongue-tied.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.640
"Faber est suae quisque fortunae."

14:37.640 --> 14:40.280
Irene, could you translate, please?

14:43.400 --> 14:46.280
It would appear Irene
has her head elsewhere,

14:46.280 --> 14:48.160
as do the rest of you.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.720
And whose book is that, might I ask?

14:50.720 --> 14:54.240
Erm... It's my mother's,
Captain Parker.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.520
I mean, Mr Parker.

GIGGLING

14:57.800 --> 14:59.760
Silentium!

14:59.760 --> 15:02.480
I don't know what's wrong with
you girls this morning!

15:04.880 --> 15:08.640
"Faber est suae quisque fortunae."

15:08.640 --> 15:11.480

Irene, please?

15:12.480 --> 15:14.560
I...
WHISPERS: You know this.

15:18.040 --> 15:21.800
"Every man is the architect
of his own fortune."

15:21.800 --> 15:23.680
I expected more from you, Mary-Lou.

15:23.680 --> 15:27.280
Well, it would appear you all know
less than you did last week,

15:27.280 --> 15:30.000
which is an impressive feat
by anyone's standards.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.840
I expect better in your Latin test
coming up!

15:43.560 --> 15:47.360
Lupus...non timet

15:47.360 --> 15:50.960
canem...latrantem.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.200
Excellent. And in English.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.400
A wolf is not afraid of
a barking dog.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.160
You've come on leaps and bounds,
Ellen.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.920
You should be very proud
of yourself. Mary-Lou.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.040
Erm...

16:12.120 --> 16:16.480
Aud... Audentis...

16:17.880 --> 16:19.840
Audentis...

16:24.200 --> 16:27.920
Aud-... Oh, dear Mary-Lou!

16:28.920 --> 16:31.840
I knew it off by heart, I swear.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.760
I'm sorry.

16:33.760 --> 16:39.040
Mary-Lou, I'd like to put this on
and stand in the corner, please.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.800
It's not fair!
Mary-Lou only got muddled

16:40.800 --> 16:42.720
because she's scared about
wearing the cap.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.920
Sit down, Darrell, before I ask you
to join her.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.680
SHE CLEARS THROAT

17:11.680 --> 17:13.520
I want silent reading.

17:21.880 --> 17:24.800
Oh, I'm sorry, I missed our meeting,
Mr Parker.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.240
I-I got a little waylaid.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.480
Perhaps we could arrange it
for another time.

17:29.480 --> 17:34.080
There's really no need. I think
I have everything under control.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.560
CHALK SCRAPES ON SEAT

17:45.600 --> 17:49.560
Darrell... Mr Parker's not being
fair. I have to do it for Mary-Lou.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.520
The Eccles... Oh!

17:51.520 --> 17:57.320
I meant to say, I am confiscated
this from one of the girls earlier.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.360
Although why anyone would read
these sentimental, tawdry novels

18:02.360 --> 18:05.360
is beyond me.
Don't you agree, Matron?

18:37.040 --> 18:38.840
SHE LAUGHS

18:45.560 --> 18:47.640
D for dunce...
Darrell, what have you done?

18:47.640 --> 18:49.880
It's no worse than what you did
to Mam'zelle Rougier?

18:49.880 --> 18:52.000
A little smudge,
we can get away with.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.400
How do you expect us to explain
a giant D?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.080
And do you know what
the worst thing is?

18:56.080 --> 18:59.600
Everyone's going to think
poor Mary-Lou is the culprit.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.320
Mary-Lou?

19:21.320 --> 19:24.600
I'd like you to stay behind and
practise your Latin prep, please.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.800
I can't believe Mr Parker
did that to Mary-Lou!

19:36.800 --> 19:38.680
I feel so bad for her!

19:38.680 --> 19:40.400
Oh...

19:45.760 --> 19:51.080
Monsieur Parker, you have something
on your... On your derriere.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.640
Oh, Mr Parker, this requires
baking soda

19:53.640 --> 19:55.920
or we risk a nasty stain.

19:57.120 --> 20:01.160
Yes, it appears to be the letter D.
LAUGHTER

20:01.160 --> 20:05.560
It's the same pink chalk
I found smudged all over my skirt.

20:05.560 --> 20:06.720
What did I tell you?

20:06.720 --> 20:09.160
Mr Parker, these girls,
they are out of control.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.120
Don't worry, Matron.
I'll deal with this.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.960
Go, go, go, go!

20:20.960 --> 20:23.520
We need to get out of here
before Mr Parker catches up with us.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.280
But what about poor Mary-Lou?
She needs our help.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.920
May we come in?

20:40.320 --> 20:42.240
We can all be dunces together!

20:42.240 --> 20:44.080
THEY LAUGH

20:45.400 --> 20:47.160
You look so silly!

20:47.160 --> 20:49.240
LAUGHTER ECHOES

20:53.600 --> 20:55.880
LAUGHTER

21:06.720 --> 21:09.600
As if that stunt with the chalk
wasn't bad enough,

21:09.600 --> 21:12.760
you now go out of your way
to undermine my authority!

21:14.480 --> 21:16.120
It was... It was my idea.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.000
Then you'd better come with me.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.760
No, Darrell... Darrell...

21:25.760 --> 21:28.280
You only did it to make me
feel better.

21:33.640 --> 21:38.080
Mr Parker, this is not
Darrell's fault.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.160
She just hated seeing me
being punished in such an awful way.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.280
I had to wear a dunce's cap
when I was at school.

21:44.280 --> 21:47.920
Then you must be able to remember
how it made you feel.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.440
Did you feel embarrassed?

21:50.440 --> 21:51.480
Humiliated?

21:53.200 --> 21:55.240
That's why I couldn't get
my words out.

21:55.240 --> 21:58.560
I was so scared
about being punished.

21:58.560 --> 22:02.560
All I ever want to do
is get the best out of you, girls.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.440
My grandmother always says
that given the choice

22:05.440 --> 22:09.480
between being right and being kind,
always be kind.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.280
Audentis fortuna iuvat.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.040
Fortune favours the bold.

22:31.720 --> 22:37.000
I'm willing to overlook the stunt
with the chalk on one condition -

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
you take off that ridiculous cap,
all of you,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.760
and finish your Latin prep.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.200
I think we've all learnt
a valuable lesson today.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.840
Don't you agree, Mary-Lou?

22:59.040 --> 23:01.000
Darrell, look! Is that a fox?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.720
LAUGHS: Yes, it's so lovely!

23:02.720 --> 23:05.200
Boo!

23:02.720 --> 23:05.200
THEY LAUGH

23:05.200 --> 23:07.360
Mary-Lou, you're about
the bravest person I know.

23:07.360 --> 23:11.440
I wouldn't have been able to do it
if it wasn't for Darrell.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.680
Mary-Lou, you are amazing.
Thank you.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.360
You're awfully quiet.

23:22.360 --> 23:26.400
I feel positively rotten for not
helping you all support Mary-Lou.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.720
You had prep to do.
She understands. We all do.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.240
SHE LAUGHS

23:40.680 --> 23:42.360
Did you leave this here?

23:43.920 --> 23:46.040
No. Who is it?

23:46.040 --> 23:48.800
Well, it's Mr Parker.
Can't you tell?

23:48.800 --> 23:51.560
It's so good, I recognised him
straight away.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.960
Who left this here?
GIRLS: Not me! Not me! Not me!

23:53.960 --> 23:55.640
Not me! Not me! Not me!

23:55.640 --> 23:57.120
Not me!

23:57.120 --> 24:00.680
If I could draw as well as that, I'd
be shouting it from the rooftops.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.480
Who is the secret artist?

24:02.480 --> 24:05.080
That's what I intend to find out.

24:05.080 --> 24:07.240
Goodnight, Darrell. Goodnight.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.960
Goodnight, Irene!
Goodnight, Sally! Night, Alicia!

24:14.960 --> 24:17.400
Sweet dreams, everyone!
Night, Alicia. Goodnight, Ellen.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.640
Don't let the bed bugs bite!
Goodnight, Jean!

24:19.640 --> 24:22.520
Goodnight, Mary-Lou.
Goodnight, Gwen.

24:22.520 --> 24:25.000
Goodnight. Sweet dreams, Ellen.
