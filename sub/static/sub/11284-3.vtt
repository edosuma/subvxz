OKAY, LOOK.
THIS IS PROBABLY NOT MY PLACE -

42:36.054 --> 42:38.721
I MEAN, WHO AM I TO SAY THIS -
BUT...

42:38.723 --> 42:40.790
THE WAY I SEE IT,
SAMMY,

42:40.792 --> 42:42.592
YOU'VE GOT THIS WOMAN
AND YOU'VE GOT THIS JOB

42:42.594 --> 42:44.961
AND THE SNEAKING AROUND...?

42:44.963 --> 42:48.665
IT'S NOT MUCH
OF A FIVE-YEAR PLAN.

42:48.667 --> 42:51.801
DO YOU HEAR
WHAT I'M SAYING?

42:51.803 --> 42:53.803
YOU...

42:53.805 --> 42:55.872
YOU HAVE ONE LIFE.

42:57.108 --> 42:59.108
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

43:01.012 --> 43:04.781
¶ They're all gone ¶

43:07.185 --> 43:14.157
¶¶¶

43:14.159 --> 43:16.092
¶ Ooh ¶

43:17.028 --> 43:19.095
¶ Ooh ¶
