07:16.834 --> 07:18.500
- Huh, I know.

07:18.542 --> 07:20.583
Wait a minute.

07:18.542 --> 07:20.583
What if I am?

07:25.583 --> 07:27.792
- What are you

07:25.583 --> 07:27.792
telling me, Anne?

07:27.834 --> 07:29.875
- Oh, no, no.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.875
Honey, no, no, no. I'm not

07:27.834 --> 07:29.875
saying I am.

07:29.917 --> 07:33.583
I'm saying what if, um--oh--

07:33.625 --> 07:35.875
I am?

07:36.959 --> 07:38.500
Huh?

07:38.542 --> 07:39.750
- Whoa.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.792
- Huh?

07:41.834 --> 07:43.667
- Oh, here. Here, here,

07:41.834 --> 07:43.667
here, here, sit, sit.

07:43.709 --> 07:45.041
Can I get you anything?

07:45.083 --> 07:47.917
- Honey, honey, honey,

07:45.083 --> 07:47.917
it's a watermelon.

07:47.959 --> 07:50.709
- I'll love it no matter

07:47.959 --> 07:50.709
what it is.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.208
- Okay.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.500
- Hello?

07:58.542 --> 08:00.667
Ickys?

08:00.709 --> 08:02.375
Ickys?

08:02.417 --> 08:04.750
[sighs]

08:02.417 --> 08:04.750
Coast is clear.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.417
- Thanks for bringing me

08:08.750 --> 08:10.417
home, Mae,

08:10.458 --> 08:12.208
and helping me change,

08:12.250 --> 08:16.000
and scratching that itch.

08:16.041 --> 08:19.333
- Dawn, it's been stuck

08:16.041 --> 08:19.333
like that for four hours.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.208
I think you should see a doctor.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.208
- I'm fine, Mae.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.250
- Ugh, I feel so bad.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.709
You didn't even

08:25.291 --> 08:26.709
want to go to ballet.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.166
- No, I loved it.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.375
I thought it would be boring,

08:28.208 --> 08:30.375
but it was totally fun.

08:30.417 --> 08:31.959
The boys not being there

08:30.417 --> 08:31.959
was just a bonus.

08:33.834 --> 08:36.458
- Okay, well, see you tomorrow.

08:38.125 --> 08:39.834
- High five?

08:39.875 --> 08:40.959
- Oh.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.417
- [grunts, sighs]

08:49.333 --> 08:50.375
- Hey, Dawn.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.375
- Oh!

08:50.417 --> 08:51.834
- Where you been?

08:51.875 --> 08:53.291
- Yeah, last time

08:51.875 --> 08:53.291
we saw you,

08:53.333 --> 08:54.667
you brought us all

08:53.333 --> 08:54.667
warm milk.

08:54.709 --> 08:57.375
- And then when we woke up,

08:54.709 --> 08:57.375
you were gone.

08:57.417 --> 08:59.500
- Oh, well,

08:59.542 --> 09:01.250
that milk knocked you guys

08:59.542 --> 09:01.250
right out,

09:01.291 --> 09:03.000
and I didn't know

09:01.291 --> 09:03.000
what to do.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.417
So I wandered down here.

09:05.458 --> 09:08.000
Now I'm gonna wander back

09:05.458 --> 09:08.000
upstairs and take a shower.

09:09.417 --> 09:11.333
Excuse me.

09:21.917 --> 09:25.291
- Wow, without us, she seems

09:21.917 --> 09:25.291
so lost and confused.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.834
- Yeah, she can't even remember

09:25.333 --> 09:27.834
how to walk.

09:32.291 --> 09:33.500
- Hey, Anne,

09:33.542 --> 09:35.291
these customers don't want

09:33.542 --> 09:35.291
these ski boots.

09:35.333 --> 09:36.875
Could you put them

09:35.333 --> 09:36.875
back on the shelf?

09:36.917 --> 09:38.375
- Oh, sure thing, sweetie.

09:38.417 --> 09:39.417
[sharply exhales]

09:39.458 --> 09:41.041
[sighing]

09:41.083 --> 09:42.542
Yeah, you mean the--

09:41.083 --> 09:42.542
the high shelf

09:42.583 --> 09:43.750
upstairs in the back?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.208
- That's the one.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.208
- Okay.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.792
- Be careful on

09:45.250 --> 09:46.792
that old ladder. You're climbing

09:45.250 --> 09:46.792
for two.

09:46.834 --> 09:48.542
- Oh.

09:48.583 --> 09:50.667
- You know what?

09:48.583 --> 09:50.667
Um, we'll take the ski boots.

09:50.709 --> 09:52.125
- Great.

09:52.166 --> 09:55.583
- Are you also going to need

09:52.166 --> 09:55.583
skis, bindings, and poles?

09:55.625 --> 09:57.333
- I don't think so.

09:57.375 --> 10:00.458
- That's okay; I'm just gonna

09:57.375 --> 10:00.458
lug them back upstairs.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.041
- Oh, you know what?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.041
Um, we'll take it all.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.291
- Ah, great.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.291
- Yeah.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.667
- Let's get you all ringed up.

10:04.709 --> 10:08.125
[groans]

10:08.166 --> 10:10.542
<i>[melodic whistling]</i>

10:10.583 --> 10:13.792
<i>[Nutcracker Suite plays]</i>

10:13.834 --> 10:16.458
- Don't bend your elbows.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.041
Unclench your fists.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.458
Good.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.875
- Do I look like you now?

10:21.917 --> 10:24.417
- I said good,

10:21.917 --> 10:24.417
not Butt-cracker good.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.166
- Don't worry;

10:28.208 --> 10:30.166
I've been here six months,

10:30.208 --> 10:33.125
and I'm still not

10:30.208 --> 10:33.125
"Butt-cracker good."

10:35.417 --> 10:37.208
- Oh.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.250
- My.

10:38.291 --> 10:39.333
- Gosh.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.000
She's doing ballet.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.291
- She hates ballet.

10:42.333 --> 10:45.375
- I love ballet!

10:45.417 --> 10:47.375
- Oh, poor Dawn.

10:47.417 --> 10:50.125
We weren't around, so she got

10:47.417 --> 10:50.125
lonely and followed Mae here.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.583
- So sad.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.625
- She couldn't even go

10:51.625 --> 10:53.625
two hours without us.

10:56.333 --> 10:57.083
- What?

11:00.875 --> 11:02.000
Can you believe it, Mae?

11:00.875 --> 11:02.000
They're here.

11:02.041 --> 11:03.834
They can't even go

11:02.041 --> 11:03.834
two hours without me.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.000
- It looks like

11:03.875 --> 11:06.000
they want to come in.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.834
- Please, don't. No!

11:09.875 --> 11:12.417
- She said,

11:09.875 --> 11:12.417
"Please don't go."

11:12.458 --> 11:15.250
We came just in time.

11:15.291 --> 11:17.125
- I'm gonna go out there

11:15.291 --> 11:17.125
and get rid of them.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.875
What are you guys doing here?

11:24.917 --> 11:26.542
- You know why we're here.

11:26.583 --> 11:30.041
We all know why we're here.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.458
- Yeah, I know

11:30.083 --> 11:31.458
why you're here,

11:31.500 --> 11:33.333
but I'm pretty sure

11:31.500 --> 11:33.333
you can't be here.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.041
You know, I think the teacher's

11:33.375 --> 11:35.041
not gonna want you here.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.291
- Wait, you boys

11:35.083 --> 11:37.291
want to join the class?

11:37.333 --> 11:38.417
- Of course.

11:38.458 --> 11:39.959
If our sister's here,

11:38.458 --> 11:39.959
then we are too.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.417
- Fantastic!

11:41.458 --> 11:42.583
I'll get you set up.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.750
- But-- but no, they

11:42.625 --> 11:44.750
really don't want--

11:52.250 --> 11:54.125
- Aren't you glad

11:52.250 --> 11:54.125
these boys are here?

11:54.166 --> 11:56.291
Now I can finally showcase

11:54.166 --> 11:56.291
my true abilities.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.041
Hold my waist.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.542
- She was talking to me.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.000
I'm Dicky.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.000
- I'm Eiffel.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.667
- Don't sell yourself short.

12:04.709 --> 12:06.166
You're two eyefulls.

12:12.250 --> 12:15.166
[applause]

12:18.208 --> 12:19.875
- You can thank us later.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.667
- I told you we should've ridden

12:22.333 --> 12:24.667
in your mom's trunk again.

12:24.709 --> 12:27.375
But no, you had to

12:24.709 --> 12:27.375
have a seat belt.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.792
- Can't let me have

12:39.083 --> 12:41.792
my own thing.

12:41.834 --> 12:43.333
Ballet wreckers.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.333
[blender buzzing]

12:45.375 --> 12:46.792
- Dawn?

12:46.834 --> 12:49.333
Dawn!

12:46.834 --> 12:49.333
- Oh, what?

12:49.375 --> 12:51.917
- Honey, you promised you

12:49.375 --> 12:51.917
wouldn't blend angry anymore.

12:51.959 --> 12:53.792
- [sighs]

12:51.959 --> 12:53.792
- We talk about our problems.

12:53.834 --> 12:55.834
We don't liquefy them.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.166
- I'm sorry.

12:57.208 --> 12:59.291
I went to ballet class

12:57.208 --> 12:59.291
to get away from the boys,

12:59.333 --> 13:02.250
but of course they just

12:59.333 --> 13:02.250
horned in on that too.

13:02.291 --> 13:05.041
Just--it makes me

13:02.291 --> 13:05.041
want to just--

13:05.083 --> 13:06.458
- No, no, no, no,

13:05.083 --> 13:06.458
hey, hey, hey, hey.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.750
- I'm sorry, but they're like

13:07.417 --> 13:09.750
little baby ducks.

13:09.792 --> 13:12.333
You know, waddling behind me

13:09.792 --> 13:12.333
everywhere that I go.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.583
I'm tired of being

13:13.834 --> 13:15.583
the mama duck.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.500
- Honey, do yourself a favor

13:17.542 --> 13:19.166
and tell your brothers

13:17.542 --> 13:19.166
the truth.

13:19.208 --> 13:20.375
You'll feel better.

13:20.417 --> 13:24.166
It is always best to be honest

13:20.417 --> 13:24.166
with people.

13:24.208 --> 13:25.750
[sighing]

13:30.917 --> 13:32.625
- Hey, guys,

13:32.667 --> 13:33.750
I have to tell you something.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.834
I really, really love

13:35.250 --> 13:38.834
being a quad,

13:38.875 --> 13:41.667
but I'm also starting

13:38.875 --> 13:41.667
to love ballet,

13:41.709 --> 13:44.125
and I kind of want it

13:41.709 --> 13:44.125
to be my thing.

13:44.166 --> 13:47.375
I hope this doesn't

13:44.166 --> 13:47.375
hurt your feelings too much.

13:47.417 --> 13:48.458
- I'm good.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.500
- Me too.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.500
- No sweat.

13:50.542 --> 13:53.500
- Oh, well, phew!

13:53.542 --> 13:54.792
Thanks for taking it

13:53.542 --> 13:54.792
so well, guys.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.250
- No worries.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.250
- Our pleasure.

13:56.291 --> 13:57.250
- We only went

13:57.291 --> 13:58.667
to ballet 'cause you needed us.

14:01.375 --> 14:04.125
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:04.166 --> 14:05.417
Let's be clear.

14:05.458 --> 14:07.709
I didn't need you.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.375
- Come on, Dawn.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.375
You always need us.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.125
- No, I'm the mama duck.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.125
You're the baby ducks.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.875
I waddle; you follow.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.875
Quack-quack!

14:15.917 --> 14:18.417
- No, we're the papa ducks.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.291
- Yeah, we waddle;

14:18.458 --> 14:21.291
you follow.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.166
- Oh, please.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.166
You need me.

14:23.208 --> 14:24.792
- No, you need us.

14:24.834 --> 14:25.917
- I don't need you!

14:25.959 --> 14:27.125
- Well, we don't need you!

14:27.166 --> 14:28.542
- Quack!

14:28.583 --> 14:31.041
- Oh, yeah?

14:28.583 --> 14:31.041
Quack, quack.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.667
- Quack, quack, quack!

14:32.709 --> 14:34.000
- Quack, quack,

14:32.709 --> 14:34.000
quackety-quack!

14:34.041 --> 14:36.792
[all quacking]

14:36.834 --> 14:38.208
- Hey, you guys seen Mae?

14:38.250 --> 14:40.291
- Can't talk.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.291
- We're quacking here!

14:40.333 --> 14:43.250
[quacking resumes]

14:52.417 --> 14:55.458
- Ah, do you smell that, Mae?

14:55.500 --> 14:58.417
- [inhales]

14:55.500 --> 14:58.417
I smell feet.

14:58.458 --> 15:02.125
- Yes, but they aren't

14:58.458 --> 15:02.125
my brothers' feet.

15:02.166 --> 15:04.750
I don't have to

15:02.166 --> 15:04.750
smell my brothers.

15:04.792 --> 15:06.625
I don't have to see my brothers.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.542
I don't even have to hear

15:06.667 --> 15:08.542
the word "brothers."

15:08.583 --> 15:10.291
- Where are your brothers?

15:10.333 --> 15:12.500
