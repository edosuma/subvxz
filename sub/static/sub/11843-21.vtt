- Where are you going?
- Max is in there. We gotta go get him.

38:19.460 --> 38:23.090
It won't help Max to get yourself killed.
We have to do this the right way.

38:23.164 --> 38:25.155
Two minutes.

38:25.232 --> 38:27.223
[Panting]

38:27.301 --> 38:29.770
- I'm gonna do it.
- Two minutes.

38:29.837 --> 38:32.499
What ifit takes me longer
to get into his head than last time?

38:32.573 --> 38:35.702
We have to stick to the plan. Everything has
to be done like Nasedo said- to the second.

38:35.776 --> 38:37.767
Okay. Okay.

38:39.947 --> 38:43.144
This man will hurt you.

38:43.217 --> 38:46.243
This man will help you.

38:46.320 --> 38:49.779
You tell me what I need to know,
and he will take the pain away.

38:51.992 --> 38:54.620
Who's inhuman now?

38:57.064 --> 38:59.362
Open him up.

39:09.710 --> 39:15.205
<i>Max. Max.
[ Gasping]</i>

39:15.282 --> 39:19.150
Max. There's no time.
You have to listen to me.

39:19.220 --> 39:23.316
Michael and Nasedo are coming to rescue you,
okay? Max? Max, do you hear me?

39:23.390 --> 39:26.121
Oh, God. Please, Max.
Please. You have to listen to me.

39:26.193 --> 39:28.161
- [ Inhales Sharply]
- [ Panting]

39:28.229 --> 39:32.223
He... wants me...
to make the orbs work.

39:32.299 --> 39:34.358
Okay.
Tell him anything.

39:34.435 --> 39:38.633
Get him alone. Get Pierce alone in this room.
It's the only way. Tell him anything.

39:41.642 --> 39:44.976
- [Yelping] Stop!
- Stop.

39:45.045 --> 39:47.241
[Panting]

39:47.314 --> 39:50.909
<i>I'll</i> show you how they work.
[ Panting] But only you.

39:53.487 --> 39:56.286
Clear the room.

39:57.625 --> 39:59.684
- Did it work?
- Yes.

39:59.760 --> 40:02.525
Pierce wants Max
to show him how to work the orbs.

40:02.596 --> 40:06.430
- I don't know how they work.
- Well, you've gotta do something and do it now.

40:08.502 --> 40:11.403
[Grunting]

40:19.747 --> 40:22.978
Make them work.

40:26.086 --> 40:30.523
[Gasping]
It takes... a little time.

40:35.429 --> 40:39.195
- I'm bringing them back.
- No.just wait.

40:43.370 --> 40:46.396
You had your chance, Max.

40:57.451 --> 40:59.783
Timing is everything.

40:59.853 --> 41:02.515
[Grunting]

41:12.800 --> 41:15.667
That's Nasedo, Maxwell.
Don't worry.

41:15.736 --> 41:18.171
- You all right?
- I am now.

41:18.238 --> 41:21.868
All right.
Let's go. Let's go.

41:21.942 --> 41:25.572
- Get out of here. You know the escape route.
- <i>What</i> are you <i>dam'? Come</i> on.

41:25.646 --> 41:27.740

- <i>You are not leaving me again.</i>

41:27.815 --> 41:31.149
- Let's go.
- There are only seconds left. Go.

41:35.422 --> 41:38.619
Are you all right, sir?

41:38.692 --> 41:43.289
- You were in here a long time. We thought
we'd come check. - Where's the prisoner?

41:53.907 --> 41:56.638
Fields!
What are you doing?

41:56.710 --> 42:01.045
Pierce's orders! I gotta get the prisoner out
of here! They need help inside! Go! Now! Now!

42:05.819 --> 42:09.380
- <i>Are you</i> all <i>right,</i> sir?
- <i>Sir; stand back! He? not Matt/visor?!</i>

42:12.960 --> 42:17.727
No! Go!
Lock it down!
