00:04.463 --> 00:07.006
<i>Warden Lacy, he told me</i>

00:07.007 --> 00:09.008
<i>he had always thought the Devil</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:11.844
<i>was just a metaphor, but now he knew</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:14.263
<i>the Devil was a boy.</i>

00:14.264 --> 00:15.641
Shit!

00:17.267 --> 00:19.060
<i>There's an offer on the table.</i>

00:19.061 --> 00:21.103
<i>The prison wants to cap punitive damages</i>

00:21.104 --> 00:22.897
<i>in exchange for letting you walk.</i>

00:22.898 --> 00:24.899
I say we employ the tried-and-true

00:24.900 --> 00:27.236
legal strategy of "Go fuck yourself."

00:28.176 --> 00:29.946
<i>I adopted a black son.</i>

00:29.947 --> 00:31.322
It's me. I'm Henry.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.491
Yeah. 'Course you are.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.034
<i>- Where is he?
- Who?</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:37.161
<i>- My father.
- They moved him</i>

00:37.162 --> 00:40.039
to a yard up in Bangor by the airport.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.916
<i>Henry Matthew Deaver.</i>

00:41.917 --> 00:44.835
<i>Big mess with the state police
when he was a kid,</i>

00:44.836 --> 00:46.546
<i>pulled some stunt, ran away from home...</i>

00:46.547 --> 00:48.965
<i>people thought somebody took him.</i>

00:48.966 --> 00:51.217
No frostbite.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.970
You been inside somewhere?

01:00.695 --> 01:01.718
<i>Henry?</i>

01:05.232 --> 01:07.192
<i>Henry, where'd you go?</i>

01:10.279 --> 01:11.947
<i>Where'd you go, son?</i>

03:40.262 --> 03:42.681
Would it kill you to smile?

04:00.407 --> 04:01.949
It's downright roomy in here

04:01.950 --> 04:03.493
now that you got the place
to yourself, huh?

04:06.288 --> 04:08.164
Oh, your, um, your lawyer friend

04:08.165 --> 04:10.583
filed some papers in district court.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.545
We'll... see how that goes.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.755
See, we're the biggest
employer in the county.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.757
We got a lot of friends, too.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.304
It's really too bad
you didn't take our deal.

04:23.722 --> 04:24.973
Hmph.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.353
Mind if I sit?

04:31.354 --> 04:36.151
You know, we're a subsidiary
of a big multinational.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.154
Private security, combat solutions.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.114
I spent eight months in the sandbox

04:42.115 --> 04:44.241
after they pulled Saddam
out of his hole.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.327
We were on cleanup duty...

04:46.328 --> 04:48.789
all the old-timers that
weren't ready to see Saddam go.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.541
We had this one guy,

04:52.542 --> 04:56.295
Republican Guard,
no name, just like you,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.798
everybody thought he was mute.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.218
So what we did is...

05:02.219 --> 05:04.596
we fed him his own teeth.

05:09.100 --> 05:13.187
Real slow. Clean Plate Club.

05:13.188 --> 05:16.024
And by the time we got to his molars...

05:18.276 --> 05:20.403
he had a name.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.200
List of other names, too.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.497
He has a name.

05:34.543 --> 05:35.751
What?

05:35.752 --> 05:38.546
He has a name written on him

05:38.547 --> 05:41.800
which no one knows except himself.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.346
He's clothed...

05:47.347 --> 05:50.516
with a robe dipped in blood,

05:50.517 --> 05:54.896
and his name is called the Word of God.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.314
Back up.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.900
Hey, I said back the fuck up.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.569
Hey. Hey!

06:01.570 --> 06:03.195
Lieutenant!

06:03.196 --> 06:04.447
Lieutenant!

06:32.309 --> 06:34.393
So, you've got a hearing scheduled.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.271
Who's the judge?

06:37.939 --> 06:39.523
Not assigned yet.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.779
- This your only tape?
- Damn thing's stuck in there.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.115
<i>These liberals</i>

06:48.116 --> 06:50.326
<i>just don't get it. In fact, let's just</i>

06:50.327 --> 06:51.827
- Better?
- <i>call them socialists</i>

06:51.828 --> 06:53.412
<i>once and for all and be done with it.</i>

06:53.413 --> 06:56.373
<i>And we, the taxpayers foot the bill...</i>

06:56.374 --> 06:57.958
<i>What you want to do is,</i>

06:57.959 --> 06:59.752
skip rows A through C...

06:59.753 --> 07:02.046
that's just chockablock still-births.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.132
Keep on goin' down till you see row T.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.842
Your father is there.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.678
Once I find it, what do I do?

07:09.679 --> 07:12.682
I need a John Handcock
from the original signatory.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.654
Beautiful spot you picked out here.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.698
This whole thing's
fuckin' pointless, if you ask me.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.368
My father deserves
better than this landfill.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.078
He should be at his church.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.205
When are they gonna deliver him?

07:36.206 --> 07:37.248
They've got a week.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.335
I'll be gone in a week.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.796
Right after the hearing.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.383
Your mother'll miss you.

07:47.842 --> 07:51.053
- I'm taking her with me, Alan.
- What?

07:51.054 --> 07:54.264
There's a facility.
Not too far away, in Houston.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.934
- Facility?
- A home. Elder care.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.104
Castle Rock's her home.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.273
She's my responsibility, not yours.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.110
God. I'll marry her.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.862
Make it legal.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.824
Legal.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.617
She barely knows what year it is.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.203
You gonna sign the marriage license
for her too?

08:16.204 --> 08:19.081
- Fuckin' ungrateful.
- What's that?

08:19.082 --> 08:21.375
Ungrateful? For what?

08:21.376 --> 08:23.169
For pulling me out of the woods?

08:24.713 --> 08:26.630
Let me ask you something.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.675
What were you doing out in those
woods that morning, anyway?

08:29.676 --> 08:33.096
The day you found me, wh...
what were you doing out there?

08:34.139 --> 08:36.265
My job.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.015
I had been missing since Christmas.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.601
Eleven days, presumed dead.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.854
Lucky for you I didn't see it that way.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.688
Fuck that Gary Cooper shit, Alan.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.526
You were out there for her. My mother.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.863
How long has it been
going on with you two, anyway?

08:50.864 --> 08:54.533
- Thirty years?
- Leave it alone.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.119
Maybe that's why you sent him up here.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.748
Did he know? About you two?

09:23.813 --> 09:25.939
<i>Help me!</i>

09:25.940 --> 09:29.318
<i>Please. In the name of mercy, help me.</i>

09:29.319 --> 09:30.903
<i>You're not one of them.</i>

09:30.904 --> 09:32.905
There he is.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.783
It's the missing person.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.786
I would have called 9-1-1,
but you're it.

09:38.787 --> 09:42.414
We stopped off at my trailer
after we got back.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.751
- "We"?
- Yeah.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.128
- Henry and me.
- Oh!

09:48.129 --> 09:50.798
Well, I'm glad you're both
makin' the effort.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.508
How'd you get him in the boat?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.635
He's not exactly an outdoorsman.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.720
No, we weren't fishin'.

09:56.721 --> 10:00.265
We drove up north to Augusta.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.434
You remember.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.355
Yeah, 'course I do.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.275
You know the Bonsans out on Pine?

10:10.276 --> 10:13.028
They lit out for Georgia last month.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.239
Had enough New England winter.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.534
Del Bonsan never shovels his own walk.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.495
I don't know.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.955
Might be nice.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.249
Go someplace warm, I mean.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.793
Where we don't have to fight so hard.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.419
I like fightin'.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.507
I thought I'd ask Henry about Houston.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.303
Maybe you'd like to be closer
to your boy.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.857
No. Fine right where I am, thank you.

10:49.858 --> 10:53.193
I'd rather just fall in my traces.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.903
Like the <i>skjaldmaen.</i>

10:54.904 --> 10:57.865
Okay, like the <i>skjald...</i>

10:57.866 --> 11:00.868
Shield-maidens. From the sagas.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.953
Fearsome warriors.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.497
I love it when you talk Viking to me.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.836
The prison offered 300,000.

11:10.837 --> 11:15.132
Dollars? And... they just let him go?

11:15.133 --> 11:18.093
- You're not taking it?
- Nah. Take their money,

11:18.094 --> 11:19.720
you gotta take
their version of the story.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.847
And just like that, it goes
from being a kidnapping

11:21.848 --> 11:23.349
to a clerical error.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.019
- Kidnapping?
- Mm-hmm.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.022
Nothing else to call
what they did to that kid.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.982
Yeah. But, I mean,

11:31.983 --> 11:35.152
people thought maybe
you'd been kidnapped, right?

11:35.153 --> 11:39.031
Do you think that's why you came back?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.617
Because it reminded you.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.794
You okay?

11:52.795 --> 11:55.089
You know, you'd make a good lawyer.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.884
Sorry.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.762
It's just you kinda went somewhere.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.681
Oh, I've just been having these, uh...

12:04.682 --> 12:06.391
I really don't know what to call it,

12:06.392 --> 12:08.102
these little daydreams. Nothin'.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.440
Well, I, uh,

12:13.441 --> 12:16.236
I see things sometimes, too.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.072
Well, shit.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.865
I guess there's something in the water

12:21.866 --> 12:23.575
over on North Prospect, huh?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.245
What do you see?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.747
It's hard to explain.

12:28.748 --> 12:33.544
Um... pictures from the past...

12:35.588 --> 12:36.923
people.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.384
Guilty just for daydreaming.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.386
Hmm. What in the world do you have

12:42.387 --> 12:43.930
to feel guilty about, Molly Strand?

12:45.556 --> 12:46.932
Yeah, there's actually...

12:46.933 --> 12:48.267
there is something

12:48.268 --> 12:50.894
I think I should... tell you...

12:50.895 --> 12:52.187
Hey.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.897
There you are.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.899
Dennis. How'd you know I'd be here?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.277
Well, you weren't home,
so just process of elimination.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.820
Sorry. I...

12:59.821 --> 13:01.614
I need to talk to you.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.953
Sorry. I'll just be a minute.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.080
Hey, yeah.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.338
Hey.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.465
Know I used to work here,
in high school?

13:20.466 --> 13:23.260
- Six twenty-five an hour.
- Listen, Dennis,

13:23.261 --> 13:25.304
until the hearing,
you really don't want people

13:25.305 --> 13:26.555
seeing us together, okay?

13:26.556 --> 13:28.849
All right. I just... Look.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.310
- What's this?
- Had to draw it from memory

13:31.311 --> 13:32.894
'cause the fucking cages
are gonna be sank

13:32.895 --> 13:34.229
at the bottom of the Atlantic,
most likely.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.982
Looked like that, though.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.070
Come on, it's evidence.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.818
Listen, listen, Lacy...

13:43.842 --> 13:45.699
Lacy's the tip of the fuckin'
Ice Capades here.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.492
The other night I saw one of our LTs

13:47.493 --> 13:50.579
blind a prisoner with delousing
powder... on purpose.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.665
The place is...

13:56.794 --> 13:58.628
You don't know what it's like

13:58.629 --> 14:01.340
hearin' those doors lock behind you.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.845
I didn't even see it
until I found that fuckin' tank,

14:06.846 --> 14:10.223
but I'm a...

14:10.224 --> 14:12.184
I'm a prisoner in there too.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.519
And the jury needs to see
what's happening in there.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.980
- But there is no jury.
- What?

14:16.981 --> 14:18.648
It's a hearing. There's a judge.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.276
No jury. And we need to focus on
the facts of this case.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.694
You get emotional, you're gonna seem

14:22.695 --> 14:24.237
like a disgruntled employee.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.448
I <i>am</i> a fucking disgruntled employee.

14:26.449 --> 14:29.326
You cannot be a disgruntled
employee at the hearing.

14:29.327 --> 14:32.121
One week. I'll see you there.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.707
All right.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.292
You know how they always say
that Castle Rock

14:37.293 --> 14:39.295
has some kind of luck?

14:40.797 --> 14:43.173
Not really luck, though, is it?

14:43.174 --> 14:44.966
Bad shit happens here

14:44.967 --> 14:47.719
'cause bad people
know they're safe here.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.307
How many times can one fuckin'
town look the other way?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.736
What'd I do?!

15:04.812 --> 15:07.007
What'd I <i>do?!</i>

15:09.117 --> 15:11.101
That ain't right.

15:12.724 --> 15:15.268
He didn't even say it, man.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.416
Hey, bro.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.592
Goin' up top, Gray. Cover for me.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.018
Jesus.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.271
Hey.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.316
Hey.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.992
As soon as I testify, we're both
gettin' out of this shithole.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.829
There's a whole world
beyond these walls.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.749
You see those cameras?

16:00.168 --> 16:01.919
I got eyes on you.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.304
You... M-Make a fist...

16:12.305 --> 16:14.347
out of your hand, like that.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.682
Yeah, like that,

16:15.683 --> 16:16.934
and bump it against mine.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.277
Yeah, that's good.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.821
Be all right.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.134
Smiling is cheaper than
plastic surgery, you know that?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.020
<i>They're just outside here.</i>

17:02.021 --> 17:03.981
<i>They want to bring in their delivery.</i>

17:08.194 --> 17:10.028
<i>They're at the loading dock.</i>

17:10.029 --> 17:11.446
<i>They want to know if they
should bring it up now.</i>

19:21.369 --> 19:23.536
Hey, Mom.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.957
Oh! Alan had a good day. Three brookies.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.043
Mmm. You know,

19:30.044 --> 19:32.671
he gets 'em for me
'cause he thinks I like trout.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.256
Truth is, I just like gutting 'em.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.551
Did you ever hear
the name Vince Desjardins?

19:38.552 --> 19:41.805
Lived out on Remo Road?

19:41.806 --> 19:43.682
Yeah. "The gardens."

19:43.683 --> 19:45.266
Still have a little of my French.

19:45.267 --> 19:49.729
Hmm. What do you remember about him?

19:49.730 --> 19:52.315
People used to say they were Nazis,

19:52.316 --> 19:53.858
hidin' out in the forest like that.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.402
But you know how folks talk.

19:55.403 --> 19:58.029
They used to say Esme Howard
was a Satanist

19:58.030 --> 20:00.240
just because she slaughtered
her own pigs.

20:00.241 --> 20:03.076
Are they still around?

20:03.077 --> 20:05.870
Hmm, let me think.

20:05.871 --> 20:09.416
As I recall, his wife
died in childbirth.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.753
Baby too. And then it was just him.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.798
Peculiar man.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.594
Vince has a felony conviction.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.138
Late eighties. Record's sealed,

20:23.139 --> 20:25.890
but he got released from prison
less than a month

20:25.891 --> 20:27.601
before I disappeared.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.941
You know what I'll do? I'll smoke 'em.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.278
Give 'em away for the holidays.

20:40.030 --> 20:43.492
Where did you think I was those 11 days?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.083
Why didn't we ever talk about it?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.712
Damn it, Mom, look at me.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.340
You want to talk?

20:59.341 --> 21:03.470
Okay. Let's talk about
you sending me off to...

21:03.471 --> 21:05.221
to fuckin' Texas.

21:05.222 --> 21:08.349
That's what you and Alan
talked about up in Augusta,

21:08.350 --> 21:10.143
isn't it? Well, I may be old,

21:10.144 --> 21:12.604
but I'm not stupid, Henry Deaver.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.982
This is my home. I'll leave it in a box.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.318
Don't you try to take me to Texas.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.237
Don't you dare.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.576
Well, better get this cleaned up.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.806
So, the living space

21:47.807 --> 21:51.893
is just under 3,000...

21:51.894 --> 21:53.895
square feet.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.272
Plus, you could finish the basement

21:56.273 --> 21:58.399
and turn it into a mother-in-law suite.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.695
- My husband's mother's dead.
- Thank God.

22:03.531 --> 22:06.574
It's certainly priced to sell.

22:06.575 --> 22:11.371
As you can see, the... the backyard...

22:11.372 --> 22:14.499
showcases all native flora.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.877
Actually, dandelions
came over on the Mayflower.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.588
- Gordon teaches history.
- Oh.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.173
I like to say, "History teaches me."

22:22.174 --> 22:24.926
He says that... constantly.

22:24.927 --> 22:27.721
- Where do you teach?
- Des Moines.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.391
Well, we're looking
for a change of pace.

22:31.392 --> 22:34.061
And you picked Castle County.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.608
- It's nice hard water.
- Mm-hmm.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.152
Um...

22:43.153 --> 22:46.532
Double-pane. You'll appreciate
that come January.

22:47.825 --> 22:52.537
- Is that a...?
- Cremains.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.164
It was in the freezer.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.336
He didn't kill himself in the <i>house.</i>

23:01.964 --> 23:05.133
Technically, we don't have to disclose

23:05.134 --> 23:07.719
since nobody died on the property.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.597
I mean, a serial strangler
died in my house,

23:10.598 --> 23:12.849
and I sleep like a baby.

23:12.850 --> 23:17.687
Look, there is a lot of history
in this town.

23:17.688 --> 23:21.274
Not all of it good. But...

23:21.275 --> 23:24.903
there's no Masshole
summer tourists in Castle Rock.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.113
The average cost of a three-bedroom

23:27.114 --> 23:29.657
is 39% lower
than the next zip code over,

23:29.658 --> 23:32.619
and as soon as Main Street
is redeveloped,

23:32.620 --> 23:35.371
property values are gonna
shoot through the roof!

23:35.372 --> 23:38.291
Which, by the way,
was just reshingled last year.

23:38.292 --> 23:42.087
Would they consider including the art?

23:44.089 --> 23:46.634
That's Castle Lake, isn't it?

25:38.203 --> 25:39.663
Hello?

27:55.799 --> 27:56.884
Hello?

28:00.262 --> 28:03.015
Shop's closed. Come back tomorrow.

28:06.310 --> 28:07.769
You live here?

28:09.563 --> 28:11.857
Not from the IRS, are you?

28:12.941 --> 28:15.693
Technically...

28:15.694 --> 28:17.905
this is my place of business.

28:21.241 --> 28:24.494
When did you buy it?
If you don't mind me asking.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.790
I inherited it from my brother.

28:32.836 --> 28:35.046
All right,

28:35.047 --> 28:37.841
you drove all this way... what the hell.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.188
You look like a three!

28:54.399 --> 28:55.776
What?

28:59.613 --> 29:03.616
Gave, uh, Sonny Liston...

29:03.617 --> 29:06.243
a high-and-tight...

29:06.244 --> 29:09.413
after the prize fight in Lewiston.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.416
1965.

29:12.417 --> 29:16.629
Used to be colored barbers
for colored, white for white.

29:16.630 --> 29:19.048
But we all got follicles, hmm?

29:19.049 --> 29:21.425
You want a Dr Pepper?

29:21.426 --> 29:23.970
Is your name Desjardins?

29:23.971 --> 29:26.013
Josef.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.350
Your brother was Vince Desjardins?

29:34.648 --> 29:38.067
You're not here for a high-and-tight.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.986
Your brother had
a criminal record, a felony.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.445
I assume you know that.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.322
I tried to track down
the case file, but...

29:43.323 --> 29:45.700
Just the thumb and forefinger.
Far as I know.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.159
W-What?

29:47.160 --> 29:49.161
He took the pointer and the thumb

29:49.162 --> 29:52.289
clean off, for a loss claim.

29:52.290 --> 29:56.168
Paid out, let's see,
270,000 before they caught him.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.755
Insurance fraud? That's the felony?

30:01.675 --> 30:03.927
What's this all about, anyway?

30:05.262 --> 30:08.764
There was an incident. 1991.

30:08.765 --> 30:11.267
Boy went missing out at Castle Lake.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.061
Less than a mile from here.

30:23.405 --> 30:25.114
It's you.

30:25.115 --> 30:28.493
The Deaver... boy.

30:36.626 --> 30:38.336
Come with me.

31:45.195 --> 31:47.864
- January 1991.
- Yeah.

31:53.662 --> 31:54.746
These are...

31:58.250 --> 31:59.959
Why do you have my police file?

31:59.960 --> 32:01.878
I hold onto things.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.965
Called the county clerk,
they said these were destroyed.

32:05.966 --> 32:10.219
No. They wound up
in Pat Kelly's basement.

32:10.220 --> 32:13.806
She thought it was a shame,
all that history lost.

32:13.807 --> 32:17.810
Then Pat's pipes burst,
papers wound up at the dump.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.980
I saved them.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.109
- Did he have a dog?
- Who?

32:25.110 --> 32:27.778
Your brother. When he lived here.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.906
That wooden crate out back.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.617
No.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.747
Vince never lived here.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.458
You said you inherited the house.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.961
Well, he owned it, technically.

32:43.962 --> 32:47.507
Moved south
when his sentence was commuted.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.636
I live here. Always have.

33:00.896 --> 33:04.523
I can see the little boy...

33:04.524 --> 33:06.234
in your face.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.990
I never did get my bones back.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.619
- What bones?
- Vince's.

33:16.620 --> 33:19.079
- Thumb and forefinger.
- You kept them?

33:19.080 --> 33:24.335
Yeah. They saw the bones
floating in the jar, thought:

33:24.336 --> 33:29.215
"So strange, so suspicious."

33:29.216 --> 33:31.592
"Run the tests," I told 'em,

33:31.593 --> 33:33.511
"You'll see. They're Vince's."

33:35.263 --> 33:38.600
You've heard of radio carbon-dating?

33:39.976 --> 33:42.186
They can take the finger bone,

33:42.187 --> 33:45.439
tell you when it got lopped off the hand

33:45.440 --> 33:47.900
down to the minute.

33:47.901 --> 33:51.195
Because of the bomb tests in Nevada

33:51.196 --> 33:54.823
filled the atmosphere with carbon-14,

33:54.824 --> 33:57.618
and we've been breathing it in
ever since.

33:57.619 --> 34:00.705
God's perfect clock.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.377
Why did you save my file?

34:07.837 --> 34:09.922
I wanted to see

34:09.922 --> 34:11.799
what they said about me,

34:11.800 --> 34:13.677
of course.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.429
Pounding on my door...

34:18.431 --> 34:21.726
making insinuations, taking my bones.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.315
You know

34:29.317 --> 34:31.735
I never touched you.

34:45.309 --> 34:46.810
Deaver, Matthew.

34:46.895 --> 34:48.837
Church of the Incarnation.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.755
Take off your shoes!

35:33.798 --> 35:35.424
You know your father won't abide

35:35.425 --> 35:37.427
any click-clacks in the house.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.406
Alan. Went out to Remo Road today.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.033
By the lake?

36:01.034 --> 36:03.327
Yeah, I know where it is.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.330
Spoke with Josef Desjardins.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.332
I thought you were here on business.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.376
He had the case file
from when I went missing

36:10.377 --> 36:12.503
in a box under his bed.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.172
- That's strange.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.675
He didn't have an alibi
for the day my dad fell.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.678
For most of the week, in fact,
according to your report.

36:20.679 --> 36:23.013
Man lived out in the middle
of the damn woods.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.724
There were a lot of alibis
to go around out there.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.851
You did a search of his house.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.938
Just you. No forensic team, no dogs.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.691
I'm sure you can see
where I'm going, Alan.

36:36.486 --> 36:38.153
No, I'm not sure I can.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.447
Guess I'm trying to figure out

36:40.448 --> 36:42.742
why you didn't do your fuckin' job.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.289
Right.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.291
Or we could just cut the shit,

36:51.292 --> 36:53.669
'cause I'm gettin'
pretty goddamn tired of it.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.421
What the fuck are <i>you</i> talking about?

36:55.422 --> 36:58.424
I <i>know,</i> Henry. I've <i>always</i> known.

36:58.425 --> 37:00.467
- He told me.
- Who?

37:00.468 --> 37:03.221
The day before he died,
right up there in that room.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.475
- My father?
- He was half-dead,

37:08.476 --> 37:09.852
but still awake.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.895
Had that fuckin' tube down his throat,

37:11.896 --> 37:15.399
so he wrote it out for me
on a goddamn bank slip.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.484
All capital letters.

37:17.485 --> 37:20.863
"Henry did it."

37:20.864 --> 37:23.323
- What?
- Just the two of us

37:23.324 --> 37:24.742
in that room.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.745
Next morning, the good Reverend is dead.

37:27.746 --> 37:32.291
Of course I had to look
like I was doing my fuckin' job.

37:32.292 --> 37:36.462
Gin up a theory or two,
keep the D. A. guessin',

37:36.463 --> 37:39.089
make sure he didn't get
the balls to charge

37:39.090 --> 37:41.760
with everybody lookin' at you
the way they did.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.932
That's a lie.

37:48.933 --> 37:52.644
Fuckin' unbelievable.

37:52.645 --> 37:55.355
This is about my mother, isn't it?

37:55.356 --> 37:57.399
- And the home.
- "Home."

37:57.400 --> 38:01.320
You're gonna dump her
in a parking lot for half-wits,

38:01.321 --> 38:03.364
and you call that a home.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.660
You're just a bitter old man.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.829
You're the one dug up Desjardins.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.956
I'm just out here trying to keep

38:12.957 --> 38:15.250
this fuckin' fence from fallin' down.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.764
<i>He was half-dead, but still awake.</i>

38:28.765 --> 38:31.309
<i>Henry... did it.</i>

38:33.853 --> 38:36.981
<i>Next morning, the good Reverend is dead.</i>

38:39.943 --> 38:42.779
<i>A little kid, call him a goddamn killer?</i>

39:21.192 --> 39:23.069
Maybe I did it.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.948
My father.

39:27.949 --> 39:30.075
Out at the lake.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.579
Pangborn said that...

39:35.373 --> 39:37.791
Back then, did I ever
say anything about...

39:37.792 --> 39:40.294
Whatever happened...

39:40.295 --> 39:42.504
it wasn't your fault.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.799
You were just a kid.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.054
I...

39:54.517 --> 39:56.059
I shouldn't be here.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.853
I should have never
come back to this place.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.105
Wait.
