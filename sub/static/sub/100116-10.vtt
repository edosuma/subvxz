00:21.021 --> 00:22.979
Is this your friend?

00:31.770 --> 00:33.207
What's their name?

00:33.250 --> 00:35.948
Mr. Wrinkles.Mr. Wrinkles?

00:35.992 --> 00:37.950
Well, that's a good name.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.213
I'm Ric.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.780
Alyssa.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.478
It's nice to meet you, Alyssa.

00:43.521 --> 00:46.481
Now, do you think
you and Mr. Wrinkles

00:46.524 --> 00:48.091
would like to go
on a trip?

00:48.135 --> 00:49.658
But I live here.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.268
I know. I know.

00:51.312 --> 00:56.230
But I run a school for
very special kids just like you,

00:56.273 --> 00:59.233
and I think that
you and Mr. Wrinkles

00:59.276 --> 01:01.322
would really
like it there.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.065
Do you want to visit?

01:05.108 --> 01:07.415
What do you say?

01:09.547 --> 01:12.202
Yeah? Okay.
Let's go.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.865
What do you want to do
about this?

01:25.911 --> 01:28.392
You think anyone will buy
a gas leak?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.531

01:39.751 --> 01:43.451

Alyssa Chang did this morning?

01:46.584 --> 01:48.586
ALYSSA:
Hey, Josie, Lizzie.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.110
Your flowers are pretty.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.242
I want one.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.766
Sorry, but our mom

01:54.810 --> 01:55.941
gave them to us.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.378
Fine.

01:57.421 --> 01:58.770
Pellis Tinctura.

02:01.643 --> 02:02.948
Alyssa Chang's
on the warpath again.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.646
Stay clear if you can.

02:04.689 --> 02:07.431
LIZZIE: Are you sure
you're ready for this?

02:07.475 --> 02:09.303
This artifact
belonged to our mother.

02:09.346 --> 02:10.521
She and her
friends used it

02:10.565 --> 02:12.567

02:12.610 --> 02:14.134
the future.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.178

Alyssa Chang has a roommate.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.576
Pray for her.

03:08.144 --> 03:09.450
What the hell?

03:09.493 --> 03:11.495
Are you blind?

03:11.539 --> 03:13.976
I spelled the knob
to "do not disturb."

03:14.019 --> 03:16.718
I need
my chemistry of magic textbook.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.981
And more importantly,
why are you on my bed?

03:19.024 --> 03:21.201
I thought it'd be nice
if it saw some action.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.637
I'm sorry, Hope.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.641
I'm crashing at Landon's.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.210
Have fun holding hands.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.814
What do you think, Mr. Wrinkles?

04:11.163 --> 04:14.558
Looks better on me than her,
right?

04:44.719 --> 04:45.676
ALARIC:
Okay,

04:45.720 --> 04:46.938
that's enough.

04:46.982 --> 04:49.419
We're trying to stop it
from exploding,

04:49.463 --> 04:51.203
not speed up the process.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.424
We have tried
12 different spells.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.252
This is...

04:56.296 --> 04:57.558
not a problem
that magic can fix.

04:57.601 --> 04:58.689
Well, it's better
than your solution

04:58.733 --> 05:00.735
of covering it in concrete

05:00.778 --> 05:02.302
and dropping it in the ocean.

05:02.345 --> 05:03.520
Maybe I deserve
the black magic

05:03.564 --> 05:05.261
to just boomerang
back to me.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.045
Just cut yourself
some slack, okay?

05:07.089 --> 05:08.046
You made a mistake.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.396
Wait.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.746
What if we try Dad's idea,
but better?

05:11.789 --> 05:13.530
Instead of dropping
the discount lava lamp

05:13.574 --> 05:17.099
in the ocean, we drop it in a
place where magic can't escape.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.797
The prison world.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.103
Absolutely not.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.322
No, this is perfect.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.019
There's a celestial event
tonight.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.934
A meteor shower-- and
that is what we need

05:25.977 --> 05:28.023
to make the ascendant work,
right?

05:28.066 --> 05:29.154
Yeah, that and Bennett blood.

05:29.198 --> 05:30.765
No, I said no!

05:32.462 --> 05:33.724
I will figure this out.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.683
Okay?

05:35.726 --> 05:36.684
Don't do anything

05:36.727 --> 05:38.076
while I'm gone.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.993
It's bad enough

05:42.037 --> 05:43.691
that Sebastian ghosted me,

05:43.734 --> 05:46.563
but now Dad's acting like
an annoying control freak.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.609
He's not gonna let us
anywhere near that prison world

05:48.652 --> 05:50.480
with our psychotic Uncle Kai.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.395
Then what if we send it
to a different one?

05:52.439 --> 05:54.876
Make a new ascendant
and a new prison world

05:54.919 --> 05:56.834
with no homicidal uncles.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.053
It's gonna take a lot of magic.

05:58.096 --> 06:00.229
We did it when we were five.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.405
With Aunt Bonnie.
I mean, we can't do this alone.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.015
Then I'll find someone.

06:04.059 --> 06:06.366
How hard could it be?

06:07.889 --> 06:09.369
LANDON:
Okay, that was a little hard.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.593
Ow.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.378
Okay, um, to be clear,

06:18.421 --> 06:20.858
when I asked for training,
I sort of meant for beginners.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.643
Yeah.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.471
Sorry.

06:24.514 --> 06:27.561
It's just, Alyssa Chang
has me all worked up.

06:27.604 --> 06:28.953
That girl has no boundaries.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.302
She takes all of my stuff

06:30.346 --> 06:32.217
and every day
she has a new scented candle.

06:32.261 --> 06:33.784
One of which
that smelled like bacon.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.090
I think she's trying
to gaslight me.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.613
Yeah, bullies'll do that.

06:36.657 --> 06:39.094
Trust me, I pretty much
have a PhD on the subject.

06:39.137 --> 06:41.096
She makes me long for the days
when I could toss a monster

06:41.139 --> 06:42.402
into the Malivore pit.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.316
Well, I know this
might not sound

06:44.360 --> 06:47.015
like the most action-packed
advice, but, um...

06:47.058 --> 06:49.583
maybe just try talking to her.

06:49.626 --> 06:50.975
Bullies hate
being confronted.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.501
I guess I could try that,
Dr. Kirby.

06:54.544 --> 06:55.763
Great.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.982
Uh, how about some more
sparring first?

06:58.026 --> 06:59.984
Maybe some judo or kenpo?

07:00.028 --> 07:02.247
Aikido?Why don't we start
with a basic jab?

07:02.291 --> 07:05.337
Have you walking instead of
running head first into danger.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.644
ALARIC:
It's definitely dangerous.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.559
It's a Mora Miserium.

07:09.603 --> 07:12.867
If it shatters, all
the black magic goes into Josie.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.086
Oh, and, here...

07:15.130 --> 07:17.611
I didn't know
those still existed.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.613
Let alone how to repair one.

07:19.656 --> 07:22.572
But... let me have...DORIAN: Emma.

07:25.488 --> 07:26.837
Dorian.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.977
I'm gonna let you two catch up.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.635
I've got to find myself
a bomb expert.

07:43.767 --> 07:44.899
Hmm.

07:48.380 --> 07:49.773
You're in town.

07:49.817 --> 07:53.211
Ric asked me to run Coven Day.

07:53.255 --> 07:56.606
You flew from Japan
for Coven Day?

07:56.650 --> 07:57.781
Of course.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.653
Why wouldn't I?

07:59.696 --> 08:02.046
Huh.

08:06.877 --> 08:09.967
For years,
witches have been persecuted

08:10.011 --> 08:12.709
for being different,
even dangerous.

08:14.450 --> 08:17.627
Coven Day is an opportunity
for all of us to celebrate

08:17.671 --> 08:21.022
and to take pride
in being a witch.

08:21.065 --> 08:23.503
To learn about
the individual covens

08:23.546 --> 08:26.114
that make up
our magical community.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.551
Hey, uh, have you seen
Alyssa Chang?

08:28.595 --> 08:30.684
No, not today.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.649
Glad you decided to join us.

08:39.693 --> 08:43.087
Sorry, I just really
didn't want to be here.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.351
We'll talk later.

08:46.395 --> 08:49.267
For the rest of you, enjoy.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.618
You'll find that what
you get out of Coven Day

08:51.661 --> 08:53.533
is what you put into it.

08:53.576 --> 08:54.751
Hi.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.927
Now, I know we don't
see eye-to-eye,

08:56.971 --> 08:58.581
and I'm sure you probably
weren't super excited

08:58.625 --> 09:00.104
about having a roommate.

09:00.148 --> 09:01.584
Oh, I don't mind
having a roommate.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.804
I just don't like you.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.370
Okay.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.894
Um...

09:06.937 --> 09:08.896
Maybe we could talk
about boundaries.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.419
Start over.

09:11.812 --> 09:15.511
She's blaming you
for everything.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.904
They're going

09:16.947 --> 09:21.212
to get rid of you unless
you get rid of her.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.606
You're right.
We should start over.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.869
Back to when
I had the room to myself.

09:31.309 --> 09:34.791
Uh, welcome to my presentation.

09:34.835 --> 09:37.315
I'm supposed to talk
about my coven,

09:37.359 --> 09:39.796
but I don't have one.

09:39.840 --> 09:44.148
And I've always wondered
why I don't fit in

09:44.192 --> 09:46.847
or why I'm bad at magic...

09:46.890 --> 09:49.632
Because you got admitted here
due to a clerical error?

09:52.592 --> 09:57.901
But I've done some research
and I think I have an answer.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.600
I've been misdiagnosed.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.603
I'm not a witch, I'm...

10:03.646 --> 10:05.953
a fairy.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.394
I know it's out there, um...

10:12.437 --> 10:14.614
but...

10:14.657 --> 10:17.355
fairies enjoy honey,

10:17.399 --> 10:19.749
they're incredibly tidy,

10:19.793 --> 10:22.143
and they love to sing.

10:22.186 --> 10:25.363
Uh, just like me.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.889
Uh, I also...

10:28.932 --> 10:32.022
never knew my parents,

10:32.066 --> 10:36.810
so maybe they were eaten
by Malivore.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.420
Maybe you could be eaten
by Malivore so we can forget

10:38.463 --> 10:41.336
your whole presentation.

10:48.256 --> 10:51.868
Does-does anyone else see...?

10:51.912 --> 10:53.087
A waste of fairy space?

10:59.223 --> 11:00.660
That's detention, Alyssa.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.966
Do you even work here?

11:03.010 --> 11:04.968
I do today.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.231
Fine.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.364
It couldn't be worse than this.HOPE: I don't know.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.148
Being alone in a room with you?

11:11.192 --> 11:13.716
As your roommate,
that sounds like hell.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.591
Good, Hope.

11:19.635 --> 11:23.117
Don't let anyone
make you look weak.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.517
Hey.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.003
Cute shoes.

11:40.047 --> 11:42.440
They'd look better on me.

11:48.664 --> 11:49.926
Hey. How'd it go
with Alyssa Chang?

11:49.970 --> 11:51.493
You guys BFFs?

11:51.536 --> 11:55.715
QAREEN:
You cannot protect him.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.542
Get rid of him

11:57.586 --> 12:00.371
before you lose him.

12:02.373 --> 12:06.551
Your advice was useless,
Landon, just like you.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.392
Hey, Wade.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.091
Uh, you know I'm always down
for more adventures

12:24.134 --> 12:25.832
of Magnus the Warrior
and G'nash the Bugbear,

12:25.875 --> 12:27.790
but I got
an emergency brewing here.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.661
Does it have anything
to do with Hope acting

12:29.705 --> 12:31.141
like Alyssa Chang 2.0?

12:31.185 --> 12:32.969
'Cause I've got a theory.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.319
Ding, ding. Get in here.
What do you got?

12:35.363 --> 12:38.758
We're dealing with a Qareen.

12:38.801 --> 12:41.891
It's an Arabian monster
that whispers insecurities

12:41.935 --> 12:43.327
and feeds off discord.

12:43.371 --> 12:45.721
Its superpower is
making people angry?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.767
Uh, it feeds off the strife,

12:47.810 --> 12:50.204
becoming stronger and
affecting more and more people

12:50.247 --> 12:53.685
until it materializes
into our plane.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.600
Right now it's out of phase.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.472
It's invisible
and intangible.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.953
I thought the Malivore portal
is closed.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.389
I mean, isn't it?

13:01.432 --> 13:02.738
I don't know how
it got here,

13:02.782 --> 13:04.609
but it's definitely real.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.264
I saw it.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.181
You said it's invisible.

13:11.225 --> 13:14.271
Not to fairies.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.146
EMMA:
So...

13:19.189 --> 13:20.625
we are going to try

13:20.669 --> 13:22.540
a meditative exercise

13:22.584 --> 13:23.759
to calm our nerves...

13:23.803 --> 13:26.936
They are so soft.

13:26.980 --> 13:31.811
Only you can
protect them all.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.552
Really? Some hurt feelings,
and this is what we're doing?

13:34.596 --> 13:37.860
It's no wonder I have
to do everything myself.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.644
Sounds like this will be
especially helpful

13:39.688 --> 13:41.168
for some of us.

13:41.211 --> 13:44.606
Now close your eyes.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.042
Focus on your breathing...

13:48.175 --> 13:51.047
...and embrace the silence.

13:52.788 --> 13:55.051
Emma, could I borrow you
for a sec?

13:55.095 --> 13:56.574
We're in the middle
of something.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.359
So am I, and my thing
doesn't include,

13:58.402 --> 14:00.230
like, "Kum-Bah-Yah" circle time.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.450
Sit.

14:02.493 --> 14:05.322
You and your sister should
have been here from the start.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.107
Again. Eyes closed.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.849
Focus on the silence.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.168
EMMA:
Thank you.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.517
I've tried everything.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.693
Freezing it,
covering it in concrete,

14:28.737 --> 14:31.087
defusing it.
Nothing works.

14:31.131 --> 14:34.264
And if this bomb goes off,

14:34.308 --> 14:36.397
it will destroy everything.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.747
Sounds intense.Yeah.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.836
But I thought you
wrote true crime.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.839
Well, you know, the genre
market's hot right now.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.623
Gotcha.

14:45.667 --> 14:49.062
Uh, so why don't you just have
your character blow up the bomb?

14:49.105 --> 14:51.673
Because the character's
desperately trying

14:51.716 --> 14:54.110
to keep it from exploding.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.243
Actually, that's the general
render-safe protocol

14:56.286 --> 14:57.418
for any explosive.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.767
Detonate it from a distance.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.508
Well, what if there isn't
a safe distance?

15:00.551 --> 15:02.249
That's how we did
things in the EOD.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.555
But it's fiction; you can just
make something up, right?

15:06.688 --> 15:08.908
Great.

15:08.951 --> 15:12.085
Ethan landed himself
in detention.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.478
Apparently, he fought
another bully.

15:14.522 --> 15:15.958
Well, listen,
Ethan's a good kid,

15:16.002 --> 15:18.004
so I'm sure he was sticking up
for someone smaller.

15:18.047 --> 15:21.833
But, look, I am not
the principal anymore.

15:21.877 --> 15:26.142
And to be honest, I wish Lizzie
would date somebody like Ethan.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.796
What happened to the
good-looking exchange student?

15:27.839 --> 15:31.017
Yeah, Sebastian...

15:31.060 --> 15:33.454
he's not right for her.

15:33.497 --> 15:35.238
And I had to let him know that.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.588
But I'm sure,
like every teenager,

15:37.632 --> 15:40.374
he was reasonably accepting
of your point of view.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.245
Yeah, something like that.

15:42.289 --> 15:45.466
Geez, Ric, what'd
you do, murder him?

15:45.509 --> 15:47.947
Well, you're gonna have
to get me a lawyer

15:47.990 --> 15:49.861
before I answer
that question, Sheriff.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.996
EMMA:
Eyes closed.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.781
Focus on the silence.

15:58.522 --> 15:59.959
Cessabit orbis.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.181
I've summoned a sphere.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.748
It represents your
collective thoughts

16:06.791 --> 16:08.184
and emotions.

16:08.228 --> 16:11.927
Our goal is to keep it
a calm green that represents

16:11.971 --> 16:13.929
serenity and peace of mind.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.411
She's using you.

16:17.454 --> 16:20.414
I know you're just using me
for cryptozoology homework.

16:20.457 --> 16:23.373
They talk behind your back.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.594
Me? I know that you're the one
talks behind my back.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.857
Your negative thoughts are
polluting the sphere,

16:28.900 --> 16:30.163
changing its color.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.468
Focus, witches.

16:31.512 --> 16:34.167
They judge you,

16:34.210 --> 16:36.647
but they're not
better than you.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.040
Tell them.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.434
I don't know what's worse,

16:40.477 --> 16:43.567
Hope stealing Josie's
loser boyfriend, or Lizzie

16:43.611 --> 16:45.961
getting dumped by Sebastian
when she's the only girl

16:46.005 --> 16:47.702
he's met since 1509.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.574
If you were enough,

16:50.618 --> 16:53.664
he wouldn't have left.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.232
Show you're enough.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.887
At least I have a family,

16:58.930 --> 17:02.195
unlike you, orphan.

17:02.238 --> 17:03.718
Incendia.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.809
I can't believe it--
you are such a bitch.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.073
Shut your mouth.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.467
That's enough.

17:17.036 --> 17:21.344
Everyone, go to your rooms
and cool off.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.309
Lizzie, Lizzie.

17:29.352 --> 17:30.614
Something's wrong.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.442
I will tell you
what is wrong, okay.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.705
That hair. That shirt.

17:36.446 --> 17:39.188
Oh, okay.

17:39.232 --> 17:41.234
I see you have a point there.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.454
What is going on?

17:47.153 --> 17:50.286
Look here, uh, Snoopy, I know
you haven't been housebroken,

17:50.330 --> 17:51.635
but I'm gonna need you
to get out of my way.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.421
Or what, you gonna challenge
me to a dance-off?

17:54.464 --> 17:57.859
Ah, very funny, wolf.
Let's go play fetch.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.086
You want to go?
You want to go?We can go. Let's do it.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.826
We can do this...
Bring it.
Bring it, vamp.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.045
Bring it.
I'll do it.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.657
EMMA: You knew she'd have
problems adjusting.

18:13.701 --> 18:16.138
It's been years, Emma.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.183
And she's still prone
to getting in fights

18:17.226 --> 18:18.967
with the other kids.

18:19.010 --> 18:23.145
Look... we have dealt with
problem students in the past.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.626
I hate to say it,
but if she keeps this up,

18:25.669 --> 18:27.018
we might have
to consider expulsion.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.238
We said we'd never
do that again, Ric.

18:29.282 --> 18:33.982
I know, but...
what if we were wrong?

18:38.943 --> 18:40.293
Which way?

18:40.336 --> 18:42.338
I can't see it.
I lost it.
Lost what?

18:42.382 --> 18:43.731
Landon's fashion sense?

18:43.774 --> 18:44.819
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.125
You said my look
was classic.

18:46.168 --> 18:47.648
And you believed that?

18:48.562 --> 18:50.912
Sorry... I think.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.218
Well, I'm living a lie.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.176
WADE:
We're looking for the Qareen.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.091
It's a monster that makes
everyone act like...

18:56.135 --> 18:57.397
You.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.574
It's invisible;
only fairies can see it.

19:00.617 --> 19:01.966
Do you want to take this,
or should I?

19:02.010 --> 19:03.316
It's too easy.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.361
Can't even get any pleasure
out of it. Sorry.

19:05.405 --> 19:06.928
Hey, focus. It's gaining
strength by the minute.

19:06.971 --> 19:08.364
Once it's strong enough

19:08.408 --> 19:11.498
to manifest itself on a,
um, non-fairy plane...

19:11.541 --> 19:14.675
Anyway, we have to figure
out a way to stop it.

19:14.718 --> 19:18.461
It is so much less impressive
when you give the hero speeches.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.247
That was all me.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.770
Okay, what's the plan?

19:24.859 --> 19:26.165
Then I get back home,

19:26.208 --> 19:28.123
and Maya is on her
best behavior.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.082
And you do not have
to be a cop to realize...

19:31.126 --> 19:32.606
That she's hiding something.Yeah.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.999
That's when I hear a noise
in the living room.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.479
I open the closet
door to find...

19:36.523 --> 19:39.352
Let me guess.
It's a girlfriend.

19:39.395 --> 19:43.182
I wish. It was like
a clown car in there.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.835
Five kids, one keg.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.924
I don't even know how
they all squeezed in there.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.492
Yikes.
So, what'd you do next?

19:49.536 --> 19:53.453
Mm... my first instinct
was to cuff them

19:53.496 --> 19:55.324
and drag them all
down to the station.

19:55.368 --> 19:59.285
But then I calmed down
and I did the reasonable thing

19:59.328 --> 20:01.548
that we always do, because...

20:01.591 --> 20:03.158
that's what we have to do,
right?

20:03.202 --> 20:08.119
I-I lie to my girls and keep
secrets to protect them,

20:08.163 --> 20:10.818
so I'm not sure I'm
the right person to be asking

20:10.861 --> 20:12.994
for parental advice.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.736
Well, I'm a little desperate.

20:15.779 --> 20:19.087
My good kid just got
in another fight.

20:19.130 --> 20:23.570
I'm Team Ethan, so...

20:23.613 --> 20:26.529
maybe trust him to make
the right decisions on his own.

20:26.573 --> 20:30.533
Then perhaps you should
let your daughters

20:30.577 --> 20:32.405
solve their own
problems sometime.

20:34.711 --> 20:38.019
And would it absolve you of your
own sins to let someone--

20:38.062 --> 20:42.632
say, a cute cop-- hear these
secrets that you're keeping?

20:42.676 --> 20:46.070
Oh, sorry, Sheriff.

20:46.114 --> 20:49.248
But I'll be taking those secrets
with me to the grave.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.251
DORIAN:
I asked you a simple question.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.818
Why does everything have
to be a secret with you?EMMA: Me?

20:54.862 --> 20:56.907
: Oh.
At least I can open up.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.387
You're never
emotionally available.

20:58.431 --> 21:01.303
Emotionally available?
You took a job in Japan!

21:01.347 --> 21:02.870
And you never told me
how that made you feel.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.654
Um...BOTH: What?

21:10.965 --> 21:12.532
What the hell is that thing?

21:12.575 --> 21:13.924
WADE:
Okay.

21:13.968 --> 21:14.925
The Qareen does have
an Achilles' heel.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.536
Uh, it's weak

21:16.579 --> 21:20.801
to myrrh, Sinbad's scimitar,
and fairies.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.106
Don't even think about it.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.021
Why don't you believe me?Can you fly

21:24.065 --> 21:27.590
or shoot fairy dust
or make others gleeful?

21:27.634 --> 21:29.592
No. Because you're doing
the exact same thing

21:29.636 --> 21:30.854
that Landon is
with his training:

21:30.898 --> 21:32.203
you're trying
to fit in.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.422
It's delusional.

21:34.902 --> 21:37.252
I sh-shouldn't have said that.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.298
You do know the reason
I'm training is to help you

21:39.341 --> 21:40.299
with this stuff?

21:40.342 --> 21:42.692
If I need someone to die a lot,

21:42.736 --> 21:46.043
or be picked on,
I know who to call.

21:48.089 --> 21:50.439
Wade, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.006
I didn't mean that--
I didn't mean that.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.182
Actually, you did.

21:54.225 --> 21:55.923
The Qareen magnifies
insecurities.

21:55.966 --> 21:58.012
It doesn't make them.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.709
ALYSSA:
Hey, book nerds.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.929
There's a monster on campus.

22:01.972 --> 22:04.497
It kind of looks like
that pimple Hope had last week.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.455
Are you sure it wasn't
your own reflection?

22:08.892 --> 22:10.633
LANDON:
Great. It's strong enough

22:10.677 --> 22:12.418
to be on our plane.Okay, well, we
need to get you

22:12.461 --> 22:13.941
somewhere safe just in case.

22:13.984 --> 22:16.335
So you don't go get yourself
kidnapped again.

22:16.378 --> 22:19.381
I'm really not blaming
the victim here.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.991
I actually don't think
it's after me.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.342
Like, it actively
avoided Wade and me.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.474
Then what does it want?

22:29.783 --> 22:32.351
This isn't gonna work, Lizzie.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.962
After what happened with Clarke,
I'm nervous to do

22:35.005 --> 22:38.182
even the smallest spells...

22:38.226 --> 22:41.316
worried that the magic's
gonna backfire.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.088
Don't let it break.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.222
LIZZIE:
Josie, wake up. Jo!

23:18.266 --> 23:20.007
Are you okay?

23:20.050 --> 23:21.443
What happened?

23:21.487 --> 23:22.575
Monster.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.185
Uh, Emma put up a barrier spell,

23:24.228 --> 23:25.882
so the Qareen's stuck in here
with us.

23:25.926 --> 23:28.189
It took the Sandclock.HOPE:
The Sandclock?

23:28.232 --> 23:29.756
Why?LIZZIE:
It doesn't matter.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.801
We just need
to get it back.

23:31.845 --> 23:33.368
We can take this
thing out, okay?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.675
We are three badass witches

23:35.718 --> 23:37.459
and one moderately
competent bird.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.113
JOSIE:
Except if the Sandclock
gets damaged,

23:39.156 --> 23:40.593
something really bad
is gonna happen.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.899
We need to exploit a weakness
to take it down fast.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.423
Except Landon's
research into that

23:44.466 --> 23:46.686
was about as useful
as his fighting skills.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.252
Oh, my God, sorry.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.298
Love you.Or maybe my research was fine,

23:50.341 --> 23:51.908
but God forbid
you use your brain

23:51.952 --> 23:53.432
instead of punching
every problem.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.131
Oh, crap. I'm infected.

23:57.174 --> 23:58.524
LIZZIE:
Join the club.

23:58.567 --> 24:01.135
Maybe the only one
that'll have you.

24:01.178 --> 24:02.789
Sorry. Monster.

24:02.832 --> 24:05.618
Why am I being affected now?
I wasn't before.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.097
Oh.

24:07.141 --> 24:10.927
Okay. I might have a plan.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.454
Hey.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.283
What happened back there,

24:19.327 --> 24:21.024
what everyone said,

24:21.068 --> 24:23.853
it wasn't cool.

24:23.897 --> 24:26.552
And we really need your help
to stop the Qareen.

24:26.595 --> 24:30.207
Why? I'm useless,
like Hope said.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.383
That's because fairies
run on belief.

24:32.427 --> 24:34.908
I did some research, and the
more people that believe in you,

24:34.951 --> 24:36.039
the stronger your powers.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.478
No one believes in me.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.305
I do.

24:41.349 --> 24:43.351
You saw the Qareen first.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.745
You were unaffected
by its powers, and when I was

24:45.788 --> 24:49.400
hanging out with you, the
Qareen couldn't infect me.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.490
I'm 100% behind you.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.318
And I'm not alone.

24:54.362 --> 24:56.538
STUDENTS :
Wade! Wade! Wade!

24:56.582 --> 24:58.801
Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade!

24:58.845 --> 25:02.892
Are people calling my name?

25:05.939 --> 25:08.550
Wade! Wade! Wade!

25:08.594 --> 25:11.248
Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade!

25:11.292 --> 25:13.773
Wade! Wade!
Wade! Wade!

25:13.816 --> 25:15.905
Wade! Wade! Wade!

25:15.949 --> 25:17.690
Wade! Wade!

25:17.733 --> 25:19.822
Wade! Wade! Wade!

25:19.866 --> 25:23.434
Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade!

25:23.478 --> 25:25.654
Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade!

25:25.698 --> 25:27.003
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

25:27.047 --> 25:28.222
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

25:28.265 --> 25:30.441
Wait, why are we
doing this again?

25:30.485 --> 25:32.052
I think it's someone's birthday.

25:32.095 --> 25:33.096
Oh.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.882
Wade! Wade! Wade!

25:35.925 --> 25:37.448
We gathered everyone we could.

25:37.492 --> 25:38.580
Let loose the fairy.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.582
You got this, Wade.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.018
Just know that
everyone believes in you.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.201
STUDENTS:
Wade! Wade! Wade!

25:51.245 --> 25:54.335
Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade!

25:54.378 --> 25:55.336
Wade! Wade!

25:56.946 --> 25:58.469
Wh-Wha-What's wrong?

25:58.513 --> 26:00.210
This isn't giving me any powers.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.997
I don't think anyone
really believes in me.

26:04.040 --> 26:08.044
This is why we don't entrust
plans to Muppet Babies.

26:10.177 --> 26:12.005
I'm not sorry.I believe.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.615
And I'll prove it.

26:20.491 --> 26:21.797
What the hell are you doing?

26:21.841 --> 26:23.059
Trusting in Wade.

26:25.714 --> 26:27.586
Wait, we can't break
the Sandclock.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.116
You're weak.

26:36.159 --> 26:39.380
You can't protect yourself,
let alone anyone else.

26:39.423 --> 26:41.251
Shut up. You'reweak.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.343
Landon!Hope, stay calm.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.140
I got this, Hope.

27:05.928 --> 27:08.496
Landon made sure of it.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.586
Oh. Dude's, like, all fairy.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.761
Like, for real.

27:14.371 --> 27:16.983
STUDENTS:
Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade!

27:17.026 --> 27:19.855
Wade! Wade! Wade!
Wade! Wade! Wade!

27:19.899 --> 27:23.816
Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade!
Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade!

27:23.859 --> 27:26.993
Wade! Wade! Wade!
Wade! Wade! Wade! Wade!

27:46.099 --> 27:47.361
Wade! Wade! Wade!

27:47.404 --> 27:48.797
Wade!
Wade! Wade!

27:48.841 --> 27:50.538
Oh, my gosh!Wade!

28:10.732 --> 28:13.430
ALARIC: Lizzie was rushed to
the infirmary with severe burns.

28:13.474 --> 28:14.867
Now, thankfully, she'll be okay.

28:14.910 --> 28:17.130
Well, I was in the library
all morning.I know.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.741
I also know you've been
practicing linking spells.

28:19.785 --> 28:23.484
Connecting people
with objects.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.534
ALARIC:
I'm sorry, Alyssa.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.799
But I'm gonna have
to send you away.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.718
Where am I gonna go?

28:39.761 --> 28:41.502
What if there was
another option?

28:41.545 --> 28:45.549
I can cast a spell to remove
the memories of what you did.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.551
What happened
with your parents.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.728
It could give you
a fresh new start.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.252
She's not like the others.

29:07.615 --> 29:10.226
What would you like
to do, Alyssa?

29:10.270 --> 29:12.402
I want to stay.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.668
I still don't like this idea.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.845
JOSIE:
None of us like it, but it's
the only plan that we have.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.368
And we have
to do something

29:21.411 --> 29:23.762
before the fishbowl of
doom fractures again.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.417
ALARIC:
Wait. "Time fractures."

29:27.461 --> 29:29.115
The prophecy.

29:29.158 --> 29:30.377
You're right.

29:30.420 --> 29:33.162
We've got to get
a move on this now.

29:33.206 --> 29:34.511
Wait, you're letting us do this?

29:34.555 --> 29:36.644
Well, m-my bomb expert--

29:36.687 --> 29:37.906
she didn't give me
the best advice

29:37.950 --> 29:39.603
on explosives,
but she did

29:39.647 --> 29:41.562
point out that I could
be better at letting you girls

29:41.605 --> 29:42.955
solve your own problems.

29:42.998 --> 29:46.349
I like this mysterious
demolition expert.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.743
Does she have a name?

29:48.787 --> 29:50.919
Are you sure you guys
can handle this?

29:50.963 --> 29:53.792
Not alone, but we have help.

29:59.058 --> 30:01.451
EMMA:
Working together.

30:01.495 --> 30:03.671
That's what Coven Day
is all about.

30:04.977 --> 30:08.328
It's only when witches are alone

30:08.371 --> 30:11.635
that we're truly in danger.

30:11.679 --> 30:15.465
But together we are strong and
can cast spells that none of us

30:15.509 --> 30:17.772
would be able to do ourselves.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.254
I'm sorry about
what I said before.

30:21.297 --> 30:22.255
You know, the monster...

30:22.298 --> 30:24.213
I deserved it.

30:24.257 --> 30:27.651
I'm gonna try
to turn down the jerk.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.879
I'm sorry for dragging us
into this.

30:37.923 --> 30:41.013
I'm sorry I didn't know
you needed help.

30:42.362 --> 30:44.146
I love you.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.061
I love you, too.

30:46.105 --> 30:49.456
EMMA:
Now, witches, focus on
assembling these pieces

30:49.499 --> 30:51.719
into a new ascendant
that will lead

30:51.762 --> 30:53.199
to a new
prison world.

31:22.097 --> 31:23.098
One spell down.

31:23.142 --> 31:24.708
One to go.

31:24.752 --> 31:27.146
EMMA:
Well done, witches,

31:27.189 --> 31:28.756
well done,

31:28.799 --> 31:30.932
but it's not over.

31:30.976 --> 31:32.325
We must
pull together

31:32.368 --> 31:33.935
and channel
our energy as one

31:33.979 --> 31:36.329
to banish the Sandclock
before it breaks.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.679
We all got to stick
together, right?

31:56.436 --> 31:59.047
ALL:
Sangiema Meam

31:59.091 --> 32:02.964
Et Nos Mundo Carcerema.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.924
Sangiema Meam

32:05.967 --> 32:09.666
Et Nos Mundo Carcerema.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.059
Sangiema...

32:14.497 --> 32:16.369
We did it. It's gone.

32:30.209 --> 32:32.298
Thank you.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.959
That jab is really
coming along.

32:42.177 --> 32:43.962
I have a good teacher.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.834
♪ You get that rush

32:46.877 --> 32:50.011

32:50.055 --> 32:53.754

We can forget all about that.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.974
I can't. Um...

32:56.017 --> 32:58.672
As much as it hurts...

32:58.715 --> 33:02.937
Um, what I said was true.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.995

I love that you won
today using brain,

33:20.041 --> 33:21.782
not brawn,

33:21.825 --> 33:26.395
and I love that you're
always trying to be better.

33:26.439 --> 33:29.050
But, um,

33:29.094 --> 33:32.880
I don't want you to be the hero.

33:32.923 --> 33:35.709

Hey, yeah, I...

34:16.097 --> 34:19.535
I just wanted to thank you
for your advice earlier.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.059
MAC :
You finished your novel?

34:21.102 --> 34:22.799
No.

34:22.843 --> 34:26.107
I let my daughters
take care of the situation,

34:26.151 --> 34:29.067
and, shockingly,
the world didn't end.

34:29.110 --> 34:33.245
So... I owe you one.

34:33.288 --> 34:36.335
Hey, uh,

34:36.378 --> 34:40.252
what do you say--
dinner this weekend?

34:40.295 --> 34:44.125
My answer's in your pocket.

35:04.841 --> 35:07.888
JOSIE:
Shouldn't you
be celebrating?

35:07.931 --> 35:11.109
Your plan worked.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.937
Yeah, but with the drama over,

35:13.981 --> 35:16.940
I don't have anything
to distract myself anymore.

35:16.984 --> 35:19.595
Distract you from what?

35:28.082 --> 35:31.129
It's okay to miss him.

35:31.172 --> 35:34.088
I know
I shouldn't care.

35:34.132 --> 35:39.006
Sebastian wasn't a great guy,
but still...

35:41.748 --> 35:46.492
Um, got room for one more
in the cry pile?

35:57.198 --> 36:00.114
I think Landon might hate me.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.910
You look very happy,
Alyssa, and I hear

36:13.954 --> 36:16.565
you're making friends.

36:16.609 --> 36:19.481
Zoe told me that
I'm her best friend.

36:19.525 --> 36:22.615
Is she your best friend?Either her, or maybe Clara.

36:22.658 --> 36:24.530
Well, that's
a good problem to have.

36:25.966 --> 36:29.274
I'm so proud
of the progress you've made,

36:29.317 --> 36:33.278
which is why
I think

36:33.321 --> 36:36.194
we can stop having
our weekly sessions.

36:36.237 --> 36:39.545
Really? I'm better?

36:39.588 --> 36:41.851
I think so.

36:41.895 --> 36:43.897
What do you think?

36:46.987 --> 36:48.597
Okay.

37:02.437 --> 37:04.222
Hey.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.835
I wanted to apologize
for earlier.

37:08.878 --> 37:11.229
Let's chalk it up to the Qareen.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.231
No, before that.

37:13.274 --> 37:16.799
It's none of my business
why you're in town.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.801
I appreciate that.

37:20.020 --> 37:23.676
But today made me realize
that...

37:23.719 --> 37:25.547
I should be more honest
with you.

37:25.591 --> 37:28.855
I'm not in town
for Coven Day.

37:28.898 --> 37:31.727
Ric asked me to help him
with a student.

37:31.771 --> 37:35.383
Someone who was giving him...

37:35.427 --> 37:37.037
trouble.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.432
What did you do, Emma?

37:42.477 --> 37:45.350
What we did before.

37:45.393 --> 37:46.612
ALYSSA:
Bad time?

37:49.310 --> 37:52.792
No, I-I was just leaving.

37:52.835 --> 37:55.360
We'll discuss this later.

37:56.752 --> 37:59.625
I know I ordered you
here earlier,

37:59.668 --> 38:02.454
but it's clear the Qareen
was influencing you,

38:02.497 --> 38:04.630
well, all of us.

38:04.673 --> 38:07.937
That's not what I wanted
to chat about.

38:07.981 --> 38:11.027
I wanted to confess something.

38:11.071 --> 38:13.291
What did you do?

38:13.334 --> 38:15.510
It's not about
what I did.

38:15.554 --> 38:18.513
It's what I know
about what you did.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.909
Josie recently did
this purge spell

38:22.952 --> 38:25.215
to return everyone's
memories about Hope,

38:25.259 --> 38:28.349
but Hope's not the only thing
I remembered.

38:31.221 --> 38:33.093
I remembered other things,

38:33.136 --> 38:36.836
like what you did to me

38:36.879 --> 38:39.882
and what Dr. Saltzman did
to those other kids.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.928
This must be very confusing
for you,

38:41.971 --> 38:44.365
but I can explain.
Let me go and get Dr. Saltzman.

38:44.409 --> 38:46.585
That won't be possible.

38:46.628 --> 38:48.587
What did you do, Alyssa?

38:48.630 --> 38:50.850
I sent them away...

38:50.893 --> 38:53.548
just like you sent the others.

38:53.592 --> 38:56.246
I thought it was poetic justice.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.292
That's not possible.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.163
You'd need the ascendant
and Bennett blood.

39:00.207 --> 39:02.209
Or I would just need to use
a linking spell.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.951
I've been waiting
for an opportunity for weeks.

39:04.994 --> 39:07.954
Watching the Saltzmans as they
complained about their lives,

39:07.997 --> 39:10.870
worried only about themselves.

39:10.913 --> 39:14.961
And then, when everyone else was basking in Coven Day bliss,

39:15.004 --> 39:17.137
I linked the two ascendants.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.270
When the girls sent
the Sandclock,

39:20.314 --> 39:22.098
they were also sending
themselves and Dr. S.

39:23.186 --> 39:24.579
I added
a time delay spell

39:24.623 --> 39:26.451
so no one would realize
what happened

39:26.494 --> 39:27.887
until it was
too late.

39:27.930 --> 39:31.238
You can thank Vardemus
for that one.

39:31.281 --> 39:32.544
Get up.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.372
We're bringing them back.How?

39:34.415 --> 39:36.417
The meteor shower's over.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.201
Dedisco.

39:46.558 --> 39:48.516
You won't remember any of this.

39:48.560 --> 39:51.171
That feels poetic, too.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.589
I think we need to have
that chat about boundaries.

40:22.681 --> 40:25.379
What the hell did you do?

40:52.711 --> 40:54.016
Dad?

40:55.496 --> 40:56.628
Where are we?

40:58.673 --> 41:00.283
We're in a prison world.

41:00.327 --> 41:02.851
I thought you said the
worlds would be identical.

41:02.895 --> 41:06.464
It's not the one you made today.

41:06.507 --> 41:09.771
It's-it's the one you made
when you were kids.

41:10.598 --> 41:12.295
Why are we here?

41:12.339 --> 41:15.821
I'm guessing Alyssa Chang
wants to teach me a lesson.

41:15.864 --> 41:18.084
For what?

41:18.127 --> 41:20.478
SEBASTIAN:
The miseducation of young minds.

41:22.828 --> 41:25.047
Sebastian?

41:25.091 --> 41:27.006
Hello, Elizabeth.

41:27.049 --> 41:29.748
Fancy meeting you here.
