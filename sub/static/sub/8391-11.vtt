WEBVTT

00:00.890 --> 00:02.778
- GO AHEAD.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:02.890 --> 00:03.959
- YEP.

00:04.070 --> 00:06.231
IF YOU TELL YOUR MOTHER,
YOU'RE DEAD.

00:06.350 --> 00:08.306
- ALEX IS THE VOLUNTEER
COORDINATOR HERE.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.648
- OH, HI.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.897
- I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

00:11.010 --> 00:14.104
I'VE BEEN IN RECOVERY
FOR FIVE MONTHS.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.939
AND I'M TELLING YOU THIS
BECAUSE RELATIONSHIPS,

00:17.050 --> 00:20.838
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS, JUST
AREN'T GOOD FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

00:20.950 --> 00:23.350
- OKAY, DREW,
PAY ATTENTION HERE.

00:23.470 --> 00:26.223
THIS IS, LIKE, A VERY IMPORTANT
MAN LESSON, SEE?

00:26.330 --> 00:29.982
IT'S PSYCHOLOGICALLY
PURGING.

00:30.090 --> 00:32.502
YOU GOT THE OLD, MISERABLE
DISGUSTING OIL--

00:32.610 --> 00:34.020
- YEAH, I CAN TELL.

00:34.130 --> 00:38.066
IT'S KINDA LIKE POPPING
A PIMPLE OR SOMETHING.

00:38.170 --> 00:40.092
- UGH, MAN, YOU GOTTA
GET OUTI'A MY HEAD.

00:40.210 --> 00:41.859
- WHAT IS GOING ON
DOWN THERE?

00:41.970 --> 00:44.131
- HEY!
- NOTHING.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.582
- WE'RE CHANGING THE OIL
IN THE BEAST.

00:46.700 --> 00:47.962
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT'S GONNA LOOK

00:48.080 --> 00:49.069
IN A NOTE TO YOUR TEACHER.

00:49.180 --> 00:51.068
"DREW WAS CHANGING THE OIL

00:51.180 --> 00:52.932
IN A 60-YEAR-OLD TRACTOR
THAT BARELY RUNS."

00:53.050 --> 00:54.005
- YEAH, SHE'LL GET
GOING THOUGH.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.280
- YOU'RE A MESS.
GO CHANGE YOUR SHIRT.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.776
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WORK
AT A GAS STATION.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.154
- OH, MAN.

00:58.260 --> 00:59.841
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I FORGOT ABOUT SCHOOL.

00:59.950 --> 01:01.531
I THINK--ARE THEY
STARTING EARLIER?

01:01.640 --> 01:03.460
- NO, DAD,
SAME OLD REGULAR TIME.

01:03.580 --> 01:04.979
- OH.

01:05.090 --> 01:06.955
- SO, UM,
WAS HE TALKING TO YOU?

01:07.060 --> 01:08.163
- OH, YEAH.

01:08.270 --> 01:10.886
YOU KNOW, I HAD TO TELL
HIM TO SHUT UP.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.069
- THANKS FOR SPENDING
TIME WITH HIM.

01:12.170 --> 01:13.967
- I LOVE HIM.

01:14.070 --> 01:15.094
HE'S MY GRANDSON,
YOU KNOW?

01:15.210 --> 01:16.791
I LOVE YOU,

01:16.900 --> 01:19.209
AND THE TRACTOR,
AND I LOVE HIM.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.412
- WHO COMES FIRST?

01:20.520 --> 01:23.034
- TRACTOR.
- OH, I KNEW IT.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.526
- I'M GOING TO SCHOOL.
I'LL BE HOME BY 10:30.

01:24.630 --> 01:26.666
- WHOA, NELLY, 10:30
ON A WEEKNIGHT?

01:26.770 --> 01:28.214
- OKAY, I'LL COME HOME AT 10:00.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING TONIGHT?

01:28.320 --> 01:29.878
- TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE.
GOD!

01:29.980 --> 01:31.083
- WHOSE HOUSE
ARE YOU GOING TO?

01:31.190 --> 01:33.841
- JENNA'S.

01:33.950 --> 01:35.679
- I DON'T KNOW--
- YES, YOU DO, MOM.

01:35.780 --> 01:37.054
- OKAY.
- OKAY, FINE?

01:37.160 --> 01:38.229
CAN I GO?

01:38.330 --> 01:39.774
- FINE.
CALL ME.

01:39.890 --> 01:42.029
- GREAT, THANKS.
SEE YOU.

01:42.130 --> 01:47.022
- I LOVE YOU.
- BYE.

01:47.140 --> 01:47.925
- SHE'S LYING.

01:48.030 --> 01:49.679
- HADDIE'S LYING?
- YOU THINK?

01:49.790 --> 01:51.064
- YEP, I THINK SHE'S LYING.

01:51.180 --> 01:52.659
I THINK SHE'S GOING
TO SEE THAT BOY ALEX.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.411
- WAIT A MINUTE, WE DON'T
KNOW THAT SHE'S LYING.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.078
- YOU KNOW, SHE NEEDS
A CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE SHE LIED.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.171
OKAY, IF SHE'S LYING,
SHE NEEDS A CONSEQUENCE,

01:59.290 --> 02:00.769
OR SHE'S JUST GONNA
KEEP LYING.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.212
I WOULD.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.799
- HOW'S THAT OATMEAL?

02:03.910 --> 02:06.287
- TASTES KIND OF MUSHY.
- MMM.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.015
DID YOU KNOW THAT OATMEAL
IS WHAT THEY CALL PORRIDGE

02:08.120 --> 02:10.987
IN FAIRY TALES?

02:11.090 --> 02:13.012
OH, MY--WHAT?

02:13.130 --> 02:15.530
NO.

02:15.650 --> 02:17.129
OH, NO.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.379
- OH, BOY.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.924
- OH, BABE, DON'T TOUCH IT.
OH!

02:21.030 --> 02:22.065
- WHAT? WHAT?
I GOT IT.

02:22.170 --> 02:23.159
- IS IT HURT?

02:23.280 --> 02:24.656
- I THINK IT'S STUNNED.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.239
- WELL, WILL IT BE OKAY?

02:26.350 --> 02:27.681
- YEAH, SWEETIE,
IT'LL BE FINE.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.176
HEY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GO
FIND A SHOE BOX,

02:29.280 --> 02:33.796
I'LL MAKE A BIRD HOSPITAL.

02:33.910 --> 02:35.218
IT'LL BE FINE, RIGHT?

02:35.320 --> 02:37.140
- WE'LL SEE.

02:37.260 --> 02:38.284
- OH, BABE, DON'T TAKE IT
IN THE HOUSE.

02:38.390 --> 02:40.255
- WHAT?
- NO, IT'S NOT HYGIENIC.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.736
- IT'S NOT HYGIENIC?
- NO, IT'S NOT.

02:41.850 --> 02:43.158
IT'S NOT STERILE.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.057
- HI, MY NAME IS ALEX,
AND I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.674
all: HI, ALEX.

02:47.780 --> 02:50.089
- THEY SAY YOU HAVE
TO HIT ROCK BO'I'I'OM

02:50.200 --> 02:52.816
BEFORE YOU CAN HUMBLE YOURSELF
AND GIVE UP YOUR DEPENDENCE.

02:52.930 --> 02:54.818
THEY ALSO SAY IF YOU GIVE UP
THAT DEPENDENCE,

02:54.930 --> 02:56.989
YOU START
TO FEEL LIFE AGAIN.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.091
AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT IT IS TRUE,

02:59.210 --> 03:01.201
THAT PIECE BY PIECE,
STEP BY STEP

03:01.310 --> 03:03.722
YOU START TO FEEL
YOUR LIFE COMING BACK.

03:03.830 --> 03:06.390
NOW, I MADE A FRIEND.

03:06.490 --> 03:11.280
AND SHE REALLY SHOWED ME
THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO OFFER.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.039
YOU KNOW, SHE SHOWED ME
MY WORTH.

03:13.150 --> 03:14.287
I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD MEET SOMEBODY

03:14.400 --> 03:17.801
THAT WAS SO KIND
AND UNSELFISH,

03:17.920 --> 03:19.433
SO CARING.

03:19.540 --> 03:22.885
SO I WANT TO THANK HER.

03:22.990 --> 03:24.366
I WANT TO THANK
MY SPONSOR.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.708
I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU

03:25.820 --> 03:27.048
FOR REMINDING ME
WHAT I'M FIGHTING FOR.

03:27.170 --> 03:28.922
SO THANK YOU.

03:29.030 --> 03:32.511
[applause]

03:35.830 --> 03:38.958
[melodic folk music]

03:39.080 --> 03:40.104
- THANKS FOR COMING WITH ME.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.723
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.139
- I MEAN, THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME COME.

03:54.230 --> 03:56.050
UM...

03:56.160 --> 03:58.913
YOUR FRIEND WHO YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT,

03:59.030 --> 04:00.986
IT'S ME, RIGHT?

04:04.170 --> 04:06.377
- YES.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.893
OF COURSE IT IS.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.104
- AND I LIKE YOU

04:12.210 --> 04:14.349
I LIKE YOU

04:14.460 --> 04:16.769
- I FEEL REALLY LUCKY.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.839
- IN MY HEART
SHE'S ALL I SAW

04:26.950 --> 04:30.124
I HANG ON

04:30.230 --> 04:32.289
TO THE HOPE

04:32.410 --> 04:38.064
YOU'RE NOT TOO LATE

04:38.170 --> 04:41.822
THAT YOU'RE NOT TOO LATE

04:49.530 --> 04:52.556
MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

04:52.670 --> 04:55.138
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

04:55.260 --> 04:57.353
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

04:57.460 --> 04:59.462
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

04:59.570 --> 05:02.368
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

05:02.470 --> 05:04.324
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

05:04.440 --> 05:06.431
AND MAY YOU STAY

05:06.540 --> 05:09.338
FOREVER YOUNG

05:09.440 --> 05:11.783
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

05:11.890 --> 05:14.199
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

05:14.310 --> 05:16.687
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

05:16.790 --> 05:19.372
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

05:19.490 --> 05:21.549
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

05:21.660 --> 05:23.525
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

05:23.630 --> 05:25.450
AND MAY YOU STAY

05:25.560 --> 05:28.734
FOREVER YOUNG

05:28.840 --> 05:30.876
MAY YOU STAY

05:30.980 --> 05:34.427
FOREVER YOUNG

05:50.830 --> 05:54.789
- [chuckles]

05:54.900 --> 05:57.277
- HEY, JABBAR,
WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR ROOM?

05:57.390 --> 06:00.769
DID SOMETHING
EXPLODE IN THERE?

06:00.870 --> 06:01.905
- UM, NO.
- NO?

06:02.010 --> 06:04.285
DID YOU SEE HIS ROOM WHEN
YOU WERE GETTING HIM DRESSED?

06:04.390 --> 06:06.358
CLOTH ES, TOYS, CRAYONS
EVERYWHERE.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.348
IT WAS A MESS.

06:08.470 --> 06:11.359
- I DIDN'T NOTICE.

06:11.470 --> 06:14.746
- JABBAR, YOU'VE GOT TO BE MORE
RESPONSIBLE WITH YOUR THINGS.

06:14.850 --> 06:16.784
PUT THEM AWAY WHEN
YOU'RE DONE USING THEM.

06:16.890 --> 06:18.096
- BUT I WASN'T
DONE USING THEM.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.373
- IF YOU'RE GOING TO BED,
YOU'RE DONE USING THEM.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.549
I NEED YOU
TO GET UP RIGHT NOW,

06:21.650 --> 06:23.333
GO IN THERE,
AND CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.202
GET SOME DONE BEFORE SCHOOL.
LET'S GO.

06:25.310 --> 06:26.959
- I GUESS YOUR MOM WANTS YOU
TO DO IT, YOU BETTER GO.

06:33.010 --> 06:34.557
- "I GUESS YOUR MOM
WANTS YOU TO"?

06:34.670 --> 06:36.285
WHAT'S THAT?
YOU SHOULD WANT HIM TO TOO.

06:36.390 --> 06:39.041
AND, BY THE WAY,
A SHRUG DOESN'T CONSTITUTE

06:39.150 --> 06:40.458
HAVING MY BACK ON THIS.

06:40.570 --> 06:41.969
- I DON'T THINK I SHRUGGED,
BUT I DON'T--

06:42.090 --> 06:43.637
- NO, YOU TOTALLY SHRUGGED.

06:43.740 --> 06:46.300
- OKAY, WELL, I'M SORRY
IF I DON'T THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

06:46.400 --> 06:47.298
FOR A LITTLE KID
TO CLEAN HIS ROOM.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.469
I MEAN, HE'S A LITTLE KID.

06:48.580 --> 06:49.399
IT'S JUST GONNA
GET MESSY AGAIN.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.296
- ALL RIGHT.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.401
HE HAS TO LEARN
RESPONSIBILITY,

06:53.510 --> 06:55.023
AND THAT'S OUR JOB
AS PARENTS TO TEACH HIM THAT.

06:55.130 --> 06:56.233
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

06:56.340 --> 06:57.568
WE NEED TO BE
ON THE SAME PAGE.

06:57.690 --> 06:59.134
WE HAVE TO DISCIPLINE HIM.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.446
I NEED YOU TO BACK ME UP
ON THAT.

07:00.550 --> 07:01.414
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

07:01.520 --> 07:04.489
WE'RE A TEAM.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.763
- YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOOD,

07:06.870 --> 07:09.316
BUT JUDGE GAINER'S
A HARD ASS.

07:09.420 --> 07:10.762
I NEED YOU TO FIND EVIDENCE

07:10.870 --> 07:12.428
THAT THEY WERE ACT IVELY
INVOLVED IN THE INFRINGEMENT.

07:12.530 --> 07:13.906
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
HEY, SORRY.

07:14.010 --> 07:17.969
- HI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING--
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

07:18.090 --> 07:19.466
SORRY.

07:19.570 --> 07:20.776
OKAY, ANYWAY,
YOU GOT THAT, RIGHT?

07:20.880 --> 07:21.869
YOU'RE ALL OVER IT?
- I'M ON IT.

07:21.990 --> 07:24.333
- OKAY, YEAH, YOU SHOULD
TAKE LUNCH ANYWAY.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.919
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

07:26.030 --> 07:28.430
- "HI, SARAH.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

07:28.550 --> 07:30.404
ARE THOSE CUPCAKES?
WHAT AN UNEXPECT ED TREAT."

07:30.510 --> 07:31.545
- ALL OF THE ABOVE.

07:31.650 --> 07:33.094
AND WHY ARE YOU HERE?

07:33.210 --> 07:36.065
- WELL, BECAUSE I HAVE
SOME EXCITING NEWS,

07:36.170 --> 07:39.628
AND I BROUGHT US SOME LUNCH.
- OKAY, LET'S HEAR IT.

07:39.730 --> 07:41.550
- I MADE A NEW YEAR'S
RESOLUTION,

07:41.660 --> 07:43.480
ONE I CAN REALLY KEEP.
- COOL.

07:43.600 --> 07:48.526
- I'VE DECIDED I AM NEVER
GOING TO DATE ANYONE

07:48.640 --> 07:52.110
EVER AGAIN.

07:52.230 --> 07:53.845
- GOOD.
- RIGHT?

07:53.950 --> 07:55.815
BECAUSE I WANT TO HAVE FUN
THIS YEAR.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.263
AND MY RELATIONSHIPS
ARE NOT FUN.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.600
ERGO, TO WIT,
DON'T HAVE ANY.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.506
I'M USING A LITTLE LEGAL
JARGON THERE FOR YOUR COMFORT.

08:02.620 --> 08:03.644
- I NOTICED THAT.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.785
- I'M GONNA DO FUN THINGS.

08:04.890 --> 08:06.710
I'M GONNA GO TO MUSEUMS

08:06.830 --> 08:09.469
AND, YOU KNOW, READ MORE.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.410
I'M GONNA HAVE A GIRLS'
NIGHT OUT WITH MY SISTER.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.828
- [laughs]

08:12.940 --> 08:14.760
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME WE HAD
A GIRLS' NIGHT OUT?

08:14.870 --> 08:15.723
- I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW
THAT WE'VE EVER HAD

08:15.840 --> 08:16.829
A GIRLS' NIGHT OUT.

08:16.940 --> 08:18.453
- COME ON,
WOULDN'T IT BE FUN?

08:18.560 --> 08:19.458
- YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU,

08:19.560 --> 08:20.629
IS THAT WHAT'ESSHAPPENING?

08:20.740 --> 08:23.322
DO YOU WANT TO PARTY
LIKE IT'S 1999 OR WHAT?

08:23.430 --> 08:25.148
- OKAY.

08:25.260 --> 08:27.660
IT'S KINDA MY 13-YEAR-OLD
FANTASY COMING TRUE ACTUALLY.

08:27.780 --> 08:29.361
- IT IS? DID YOU THINK
I WAS SO COOL?

08:29.470 --> 08:30.607
- YEAH.
- AWW.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.530
- WE GET TO HANG OUT?
MY COOL OLDER SISTER?

08:32.650 --> 08:33.719
- WELL, NOW I THINK
YOU'RE COOL,

08:33.820 --> 08:35.367
AND I REALLY NEED YOU
AS A FRIEND.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.334
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- OKAY.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.782
- GOOD.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN.

08:42.340 --> 08:45.685
- YO, HOLT, CATCH!

08:45.800 --> 08:47.108
WHAT UP?
NICE CATCH.

08:47.210 --> 08:48.723
- WHAT'S UP?
HOW WAS YOUR BASEBALL CAMP?

08:48.830 --> 08:50.457
- OH, DUDE, IT WAS AWESOME.
- THAT'S GOOD.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.720
HEY, GUYS.
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

08:51.840 --> 08:53.455
- AND IT GOT ME AWAY
FROM THOSE CRAZY RELATIVES,

08:53.560 --> 08:55.118
WHICH I COULD NOT
BE HAPPIER ABOUT.

08:55.220 --> 08:57.006
- YEAH.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.179
- SO WHAT DID YOU
END UP DOING?

08:59.290 --> 09:01.463
- I ACTUALLY SPENT TIME
WITH RELATIVES.

09:01.570 --> 09:02.980
- I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

09:03.090 --> 09:04.466
- NO, IT'S FINE.
MY GRANDFATHER'S COOL.

09:04.570 --> 09:06.083
HE LET ME DRINK BEER
AND STUFF,

09:06.200 --> 09:07.155
AND WE JUST HUNG OUT.

09:07.270 --> 09:08.464
- WAIT, SH H, WAIT.

09:08.580 --> 09:09.433
YOUR GRANDPA LET YOU DRINK?

09:09.540 --> 09:11.610
- OH, YEAH, TOTALLY.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.369
HE ALWAYS HAS, LIKE,
A CASE OF BEER IN HIS FRIDGE

09:13.480 --> 09:15.471
IN THE GARAGE,
AND WE GO BACK THERE.

09:15.580 --> 09:16.717
- AND HE JUST LET YOU--

09:16.830 --> 09:18.718
YOU GUYS JUST DRINK
CASUALLY TOGETHER?

09:18.830 --> 09:20.445
- YEAH.
- THAT'S AWESOME, DUDE.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.584
- IT'S SO RAD.

09:21.690 --> 09:23.726
HIS GRANDPA'S GOT A BAR
IN THE GARAGE.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.139
I THINK THAT THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A FIELD TRIP.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.593
- YEAH, IT DOES.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.588
- WOULD THAT BE COOL,

09:30.700 --> 09:33.328
IF WE CAME OVER AFTER SCHOOL

09:33.430 --> 09:36.012
AND GOT SOME BREWSKIS?

09:36.120 --> 09:37.428
- YEAH, TOTALLY.

09:37.540 --> 09:38.564
- ROCK ON, MAN.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.704
- HELL, YEAH.
- PAR-TAY, YES!

09:39.820 --> 09:42.709
- DUDE, AWESOME.
- YEAH.

09:44.920 --> 09:49.232
- THIS IS GONNA HELP YOU,
LITTLE GUY.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.308
WELL, CRAP.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.862
OH, THAT'S DEAD.

09:56.970 --> 09:58.176
OH, MAN.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.178
- HOW'S AMELIA?

09:59.280 --> 10:01.032
- OH, UH...

10:01.150 --> 10:02.549
SHE--SHE'S GREAT.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.114
SHE JUST, UH...

10:04.220 --> 10:08.736
DRANK SOME WATER,
AND NOW SHE'S, UM, SLEEPING.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.637
- SHH, WE SHOULD
BE QUIET THEN.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.150
COME ON UP INTO MY ROOM
AND PLAY.

10:12.260 --> 10:14.672
- OKAY, GOOD IDEA.

10:21.860 --> 10:22.929
- THERE YOU GO.

10:23.030 --> 10:24.406
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT

10:24.520 --> 10:25.896
'CAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS WEARING
THAT GREEN DRESS THING,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.343
BUT MISS WATSON
IS SUPER HOT.

10:28.450 --> 10:29.417
- MISS WATSON?

10:29.520 --> 10:30.589
- YEAH, I SAW HER LAST SUMMER

10:30.690 --> 10:31.759
PLAYING VOLLEYBALL
IN BOOTY SHORTS.

10:31.870 --> 10:33.383
SHE PULLS IT OFF.

10:33.490 --> 10:35.526
- NAH, I'M ALL ABOUT
MISS GONZALES.

10:35.630 --> 10:37.245
- OH, THAT'S TRUE.
- MUY BONITA.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.759
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

10:38.870 --> 10:39.802
- THEY SHOULD NOT LET
28-YEAR-OLDS TEACH SPANISH

10:39.910 --> 10:41.320
TO HIGH SCHOOL DUDES.

10:41.430 --> 10:43.876
EVERY TIME SHE ROLLS THAT "R"
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE.

10:43.980 --> 10:45.538
I JUST WANT TO GET, LIKE,
RIGHT UNDER THAT TONGUE AND--

10:45.640 --> 10:47.847
- [rolls tongue]
- OH, GOD.

10:47.950 --> 10:49.156
I WOULDN'T REALLY MIND
BEING IN ONE OF THOSE

10:49.260 --> 10:52.366
TEACHER/STUDENT SEX SCANDAL
THINGS WITH HER.

10:52.470 --> 10:54.028
- HELLO.
- AMEN.

10:54.130 --> 10:55.859
- YO QUIERO SEXO
WITH MISS GONZALES.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.166
- IS THAT EVEN SPANISH?

10:57.270 --> 10:58.612
- YOU'RE FOOLIN', DUDE.

10:58.720 --> 10:59.823
- HOW WOULD YOU CONJUGATE

10:59.930 --> 11:03.684
"LET ME SEE YOU NAKED'l
IN SPANISH?

11:03.800 --> 11:05.552
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S--
- I FAILED.

11:05.660 --> 11:07.446
GONNA LET YOU ALL KNOW.

11:07.560 --> 11:11.178
- YEAH, I THINK THAT
WOULD BE,

11:11.290 --> 11:15.078
"DEJEME POR FAVOR
VERLE DESNUDO."

11:18.260 --> 11:19.978
HOLA, AMIGOS.

11:20.090 --> 11:21.250
- HOLA.

11:21.370 --> 11:23.770
- HEY.

11:23.890 --> 11:26.199
- SO GUESS WHAT,
THE BAR IS NOW CLOSED.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.188
I DIDN'T SEE ANY CARS
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.814
SO YOU GUYS SHOULD BE
WALKING HOME, CORRECT?

11:30.930 --> 11:32.648
- YES, SIR.
- YES, SIR.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.853
- ANDALE.
- OKAY.

11:34.970 --> 11:36.517
- I'LL SEE YOU AT SCHOOL,
IN SPANISH.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.724
- SORRY.

11:38.830 --> 11:40.582
- HEY, GRINGO,
YOU GOT MY BEER THERE.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.385
- SORRY, SIR.
LATER.

11:43.490 --> 11:48.871
- GRANDPA, I'LL PAY YOU BACK
FOR THESE IF YOU WANT.

11:48.980 --> 11:52.040
- GRANDSON, WHEN I GAVE YOU
THAT BEER AT THANKSGIVING,

11:52.150 --> 11:53.845
THIS ISN'T
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

11:53.950 --> 11:55.349
- I KNOW.
I TOTALLY KNOW THAT.

11:55.470 --> 11:58.940
- DREW, YOU LOOK AT ME.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.954
YOU ARE SUCH A GOOD KID.

12:03.060 --> 12:05.301
YOU DON'T NEED
TO IMPRESS ANYBODY.

12:05.410 --> 12:07.469
YOU HEAR ME?

12:07.580 --> 12:08.683
- ALL RIGHT.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.610
- AND I DON'T WANT THIS
TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.891
ALL RIGHT?
- OKAY.

12:23.910 --> 12:24.945
- THE THING IS YOU NEVER KNOW

12:25.050 --> 12:26.449
WHAT'S GONNA BE
IN THESE BOXES.

12:26.570 --> 12:27.525
- WHY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:27.640 --> 12:28.777
- EXCUSE ME.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.290
PEOPLE WILL DONATE ANYTHING.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.844
WE GOTTA GO THROUGH
THESE BOXES AND FIGURE OUT

12:31.950 --> 12:33.577
IF PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY
WEAR THESE CLOTHES.

12:33.680 --> 12:34.647
- WHY, WHAT'S, LIKE,
THE WEIRDEST THING

12:34.750 --> 12:35.569
THAT YOU'VE FOUND?

12:36.920 --> 12:39.718
UP IN THE TOP FIVE
AT LEAST.

12:39.820 --> 12:41.447
THIS IS HOT, RIGHT?
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.

12:41.550 --> 12:43.131
THAT'S DISGUSTING.
- THIS SHOULDN'T BE IN HERE.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.582
- WHAT'S THIS?
THIS IS NOT CLOTHING.

12:44.690 --> 12:46.578
THIS IS SO WEIRD.

12:46.690 --> 12:48.169
- THIS SHIRT IS HORRIBLE.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.623
LIKE, MY GRANDFATHER WOULD NOT
EVEN--THIS STUFF IS HORRIBLE.

12:50.730 --> 12:52.209
- HEY, DAD.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.242
- HEY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:54.350 --> 12:57.899
- WELL, I WAS IN THE AREA,
AND I WANTED TO STOP BY

12:58.010 --> 13:03.016
AND SEE WHERE YOU'VE BEEN
SPENDING SO MUCH TIME.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.462
- RIGHT.

13:04.570 --> 13:06.185
- ALEX.

13:07.780 --> 13:08.815
- NICE TO MEET YOU,
MR. BRAVERMAN.

13:08.920 --> 13:09.773
- PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

13:09.890 --> 13:10.811
- OH, YOU CAN JUST
CALL HIM "ADAM."

13:10.920 --> 13:11.955
- YOU HAVE A GREAT GIRL.

13:12.060 --> 13:14.403
SHE'S BEEN A HUGE HELP
TO ME AROUND HERE.

13:14.510 --> 13:16.649
- WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.510
SHE'S A GOOD KID.

13:19.860 --> 13:22.829
- OKAY, I WAS GONNA
TAKE THE BUS HOME,

13:22.940 --> 13:24.794
BUT SINCE YOU'RE HERE,
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO NOW?

13:24.900 --> 13:26.481
- OKAY.
- I'LL SEE YOU.

13:26.590 --> 13:27.557
- NICE TO MEET YOU, ALEX.

13:27.660 --> 13:28.524
- NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

13:28.630 --> 13:30.177

- BYE.

13:32.950 --> 13:35.043
- DAD.
- SAY, ALEX?

13:38.050 --> 13:39.608
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D LIKE
TO COME OVER SOME NIGHT

13:39.710 --> 13:41.598
FOR DINNER.

13:41.710 --> 13:42.813
- DAD, HE'S REALLY
BUSY HERE.

13:42.920 --> 13:43.818
- ONCE SECOND.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.569
- YOU KNOW, I'D ACTUALLY
LOVE THAT.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.851
- YEAH?
- YEAH, A LOT.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.019
- HOW'S WEDNESDAY?
- WEDNESDAY WORKS.

13:49.130 --> 13:51.269
- GREAT.
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN.

13:51.380 --> 13:52.927
- SEE YOU THEN.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.653
- SEE YOU THEN.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.409
- COME ON, HONEY.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.387
[folk music]

14:10.090 --> 14:11.114
- HEY, HADDIE, I'M GONNA
GO TO THE MARKET TODAY.

14:11.220 --> 14:12.664
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR FRIEND
WOULD LIKE FOR DINNER?

14:12.780 --> 14:14.839
- HEY, IT'S YOUR THING.
YOU SHOULD REALLY GO WILD.

14:14.950 --> 14:16.224
- WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO,
YOU KNOW, DOUBLE UP

14:16.330 --> 14:18.150
ON ANYTHING YOU GUYS
MAKE AT THE SOUP KITCHEN.

14:18.270 --> 14:19.919
- LIKE SOUP.
- NO SOUP.

14:20.030 --> 14:22.669
- MOM, ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE SOMETHING WEIRD?

14:22.790 --> 14:24.758
BECAUSE USUALLY
WHEN GUESTS COME OVER,

14:24.860 --> 14:25.758
YOU MAKE WEIRD STUFF.

14:25.860 --> 14:26.849
- I DON'T COOK WEIRD STUFF.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.029
- WHO'S THE GUEST?

14:28.140 --> 14:29.209
- WE'RE GONNA MAKE
SOMETHING NICE.

14:29.310 --> 14:30.720
- IT'S NOBODY.
- WHO'S THE GUEST?

14:30.830 --> 14:32.058
- JUST SOMEBODY THAT I WORK WITH
THAT DAD WANTED TO COME OVER.

14:32.180 --> 14:34.694
- IS IT THE BOY FROM THE FOOD
BANK THAT YOU LIED ABOUT?

14:34.800 --> 14:36.654
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
- NO HITTING!

14:36.770 --> 14:37.839
- THAT WAS UNCALLED FOR, OKAY?

14:37.940 --> 14:38.929
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOVE
YOUR BROTHER'S HEAD.

14:39.050 --> 14:40.176
- EXACTLY.
- WE WERE PLAYING.

14:40.290 --> 14:43.589
- HOW ABOUT RFISNTE/lARY CHICKEN?

14:46.050 --> 14:48.223
- THINGS LOOK SAD
WHEN THEY'RE DEAD.

14:48.330 --> 14:50.810
- GREAT OBSERVATION,
HONEY.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.808
- MORTALITY MAKES YOU SNIPPY.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.297
- I JUST FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
LYING TO SYD.

14:55.410 --> 14:57.958
- WELL, ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL TELL HER.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.231
- YEAH?
- WE'LL TELL HER, YEAH.

14:59.340 --> 15:01.160
- GOOD.
- WHAT SHOULD WE SAY?

15:01.270 --> 15:03.921
- I WAS THINKING SOMETHING
ALONG THE LINES OF,

15:04.040 --> 15:06.372
"THE BIRD IS DEAD."
YOU LIKE THAT?

15:06.490 --> 15:07.514
- WELL, THAT'S
A LITTLE HARSH.

15:07.630 --> 15:08.722
- WHAT ELSE CAN WE SAY?

15:08.830 --> 15:10.934
I MEAN, IT'S NATURE,
IT IS HARSH.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.691
- WELL, DOES SHE NEED TO KNOW
AT AGE SIX THAT NATURE'S HARSH?

15:13.800 --> 15:14.732
- IF SYD LIVED ON A FARM,

15:14.840 --> 15:16.660
SHE'D HAVE SEEN DEATH
100 TIMES BY NOW.

15:16.770 --> 15:18.704
- LET'S MOVE TO A FARM.

15:18.810 --> 15:20.801
- SHE'S SO INNOCENT
AND HAPPY,

15:20.920 --> 15:22.251
AND SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.817
IT'S JUST,
WHO WANTS TO BRING

15:24.920 --> 15:27.980
THAT LITTLE SURPRISE
TO THE PARTY?

15:28.090 --> 15:30.957
- WELL, IF WE BRING UP HEAVEN,

15:31.060 --> 15:32.470
IT'LL BE A LOT LESS SCARY.

15:32.580 --> 15:35.856
- NO.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.611
- I MEAN, I KNOW YOU AND I
ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING, BUT...

15:38.730 --> 15:39.992
- FUNNY.

15:40.110 --> 15:41.896
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU GONNA
TELL HER ABOUT HEAVEN?

15:42.010 --> 15:43.898
- NORMAL STUFF.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.932
- YOU MEAN
THE MADE-UP STUFF?

15:46.040 --> 15:47.905
- YEAH, THE MADE-UP STUFF.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.591
- I DON'T WANT
TO LIE TO HER.

15:49.700 --> 15:50.564
- YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT IT'S LYING.

15:50.670 --> 15:51.591
- YOU DON'T KNOW.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.940
- EXACTLY, YOU DON'T KNOW.

15:53.050 --> 15:54.085
THAT'S THE POINT.
THAT'S WHAT FAITH IS.

15:54.190 --> 15:55.566
YOU DON'T KNOW.

15:55.670 --> 15:57.809
- IS AMELIA AWAKE YET?

15:57.920 --> 15:58.989
- HI, SWEETIE!

15:59.090 --> 16:01.012
- NO, SHE'S STILL ASLEEP.

16:01.130 --> 16:03.462
- YEP.
- SHE'S SLEEPING A LOT.

16:03.580 --> 16:04.604
- YEAH, MM-HMM.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.506
- YOU KNOW, BIRDS
WHEN THEY'RE RECOVERING

16:06.620 --> 16:07.928
FROM A CONCUSSION,

16:08.030 --> 16:10.646
WHICH IS WHAT AMELIA
IS RECOVERING FROM,

16:10.760 --> 16:11.966
THEY DO TEND
TO SLEEP A LOT.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.105
- TONS.

16:13.210 --> 16:14.791
- I MEAN, A DAY OR TWO DAYS.

16:14.900 --> 16:17.312
- EVEN THREE,
NOT UNCOMMON FOR A BIRD.

16:17.420 --> 16:20.071
- YEAH, BECAUSE GLASS
IS SO HARD,

16:20.180 --> 16:24.492
AND THEIR BRAINS
ARE SO VERY, VERY SOFT.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.114
- OKAY, BUT I CAN'T WAIT
TILL SHE WAKES UP.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.018
- MM-HMM.
- YEAH, ME--ME TOO.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.155
- GET OUTTA HERE, GUYS.

16:31.260 --> 16:32.807
- OKAY, TIME FOR SCHOOL.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.012
- BYE, DADDY.
- GOOD-BYE, TURNIP.

16:34.130 --> 16:35.085
LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.815
- HAVE A GOOD ONE.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.057
- UH-HUH.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.401
- THIS CAN'T GO ON.
- I KNOW.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.958
- HEY, YOUR MOM'S
GONNA BE HOME SOON.

16:47.070 --> 16:48.890
YOU WANT TO CLEAN UP
YOUR ROOM A LITTLE BIT?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.649
- AFTER I'M DONE PLAYING.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.692
- EXCUSE ME?

16:51.800 --> 16:52.937
- AFTER I'M DONE PLAYING.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.177
- OH, YEAH,
WHEN'S THAT GONNA BE,

16:54.280 --> 16:55.759
WHEN YOU'RE 11
AND START LIKING GIRLS?

16:55.870 --> 16:56.973
- WHAT?

16:57.080 --> 16:58.047
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

16:58.150 --> 16:59.731
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE TALK.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.592
A LITTLE MAN TALK.

17:01.710 --> 17:03.974
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.251
NOW I DON'T WANT TO DO
THAT GENERIC DAD THING

17:06.370 --> 17:09.089
AND BARK ORDERS AT YOU
OR BRIBE YOU.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.883
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
LIKE A MAN.

17:10.990 --> 17:12.059
YOU'RE A MATURE YOUNG MAN.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.912
I THINK WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THIS LOGICALLY.

17:14.030 --> 17:15.713
CAN WE HAVE A MAN TALK?
- MM-HMM.

17:15.820 --> 17:17.378
- OKAY.

17:17.480 --> 17:18.856
YOU DON'T LIKE CLEANING
YOUR ROOM, I GET IT.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.473
I DON'T LIKE CLEANING
MY ROOM EITHER.

17:20.590 --> 17:22.239
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT--
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

17:22.350 --> 17:24.102
IT'S IMPORTANT
TO YOUR MOM, OKAY?

17:24.210 --> 17:26.201
SO THAT MEANS
WE GOTTA DO IT.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.969
'CAUSE OUR JOB AS GUYS,

17:28.080 --> 17:29.650
WE GOTTA MAKE
OUR LADIES HAPPY.

17:29.770 --> 17:30.998
ALL RIGHT?
- OKAY.

17:31.110 --> 17:33.522
- DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
- MM-HMM.

17:33.630 --> 17:34.767
- OKAY, GOOD.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.040
SO YOU'LL
CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM?

17:36.150 --> 17:37.082
- YEP.
- OKAY.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.420
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,

17:39.540 --> 17:41.155
I'LL EVEN HELP YOU
THIS ONE TIME.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.012
BUT THEN YOU GOTTA
DO IT YOURSELF AFTER THAT.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.677
IT'LL BE OUR SECRET.

17:44.780 --> 17:45.951
SECRET ON THREE?

17:46.060 --> 17:47.334
both: ONE, TWO, THREE.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.668
SECRET!

17:48.790 --> 17:50.234
- ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

17:50.340 --> 17:52.228
SEE?
THAT'S HOW YOU COMMUNICATE.

17:52.340 --> 17:54.376
YOU MAKE A PLAN
AND YOU GET IT DONE.

17:54.480 --> 17:58.758
JUST TWO GUYS TEAMING UP
ON A HARD JOB.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.338
- [makes blasting sounds]

18:01.450 --> 18:04.658
- WORK JUST BLOWS RIGHT BY.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.354
- HEY.

18:08.460 --> 18:09.768
- HEY.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.110
- OH, HEY, I HEARD YOU HAD
SOME OF THE GUYS OVER.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.108
GRANDPA TOLD ME.
- YEAH.

18:14.230 --> 18:17.609
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING,
MAKING TROUBLE?

18:19.470 --> 18:21.051
- LOOK, MOM, IT WASN'T
THAT BIG OF A DEAL, OKAY?

18:21.160 --> 18:22.058
WE JUST--
- WHAT?

18:22.170 --> 18:23.296
- WE HAD A FEW BEERS.

18:23.410 --> 18:25.025
NO ONE WAS DRUNK
OR ANYTHING.

18:25.130 --> 18:26.757
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

18:26.860 --> 18:29.169
- NO, UM--
- LOOK, MOM, I HAD THE GUYS--

18:29.280 --> 18:30.929
- WHO GAVE YOU BEER?
- NOBODY.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.996
I KNEW THAT IT WAS IN
GRANDPA'S BARN,

18:33.110 --> 18:34.862
SO I INVITED THEM OVER,

18:34.970 --> 18:36.585
AND WE HAD A FEW BEERS.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.009
I MEAN, ME AND GRANDPA
HAD A BEER ON THANKSGIVING.

18:39.110 --> 18:40.350
AND I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT,

18:40.460 --> 18:42.928
AND THEY KIND OF INVITED
THEMSELVES OVER.

18:43.050 --> 18:46.258
AND, I DON'T KNOW, THEY WERE
JUST USING ME OBVIOUSLY.

18:46.360 --> 18:50.774
- SO GRANDPA GAVE YOU
A BEER ON THANKSGIVING?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.324
- UH, YEAH.

18:52.440 --> 18:55.500
- OKAY, WELL, YOU'RE NOT
TO HAVE THEM OVER AGAIN.

18:55.610 --> 18:58.090
- LOOK, MOM, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER?

18:58.200 --> 19:00.509
SORRY.

19:10.870 --> 19:12.724
- HEY, DAD.
- YEAH?

19:12.840 --> 19:16.458
- DID YOU GIVE DREW A BEER
AT THANKSGIVING?

19:16.560 --> 19:17.697
- YEAH.

19:17.810 --> 19:20.040
YEAH, AND I GAVE ONE
TO ADAM AND CROSBY

19:20.150 --> 19:21.560
AT ABOUT THE SAME AGE.

19:21.670 --> 19:23.183
WHY?

19:23.300 --> 19:25.188
- I REALLY WISH
YOU HADN'T DONE THAT.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.813
AND I HOPE YOU WON'T
DO THAT AGAIN.

19:29.020 --> 19:30.408
- WELL, SWEETHEART,
I DON'T KNOW.

19:30.510 --> 19:32.887
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO
TEACH GUYS HOW TO HANDLE ALCOHOL

19:32.990 --> 19:35.550
BEFORE THEY GO OUT THERE AND
MAKE IDIOTS OUT OF THEMSELVES.

19:35.650 --> 19:37.789
- MAYBE THAT WAS OKAY
FOR ADAM AND CROSBY,

19:37.900 --> 19:41.540
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE
A FATHER WHO WAS AN ALCOHOLIC.

19:41.660 --> 19:44.208
- WELL...

19:44.320 --> 19:46.345
I DON'T KNOW IF SETH
WAS AN ALCOHOLIC.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.792
I KNOW THAT HE WAS
A SELF-INDULGENT BUM

19:48.910 --> 19:52.209
THAT COULDN'T GET A JOB.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.902
- SETH IS AN ALCOHOLIC.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.299
SETH IS A DRUG ADDICT.

20:02.230 --> 20:03.572
AND YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME

20:03.680 --> 20:05.159
YOU FOUND THOSE GUYS
IN THERE DRINKING.

20:05.270 --> 20:08.091
- OKAY, NOW WAIT
A MINUTE HERE.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.782
I SHUT IT DOWN, HONEY.

20:10.890 --> 20:11.925
I HANDLED IT.

20:12.030 --> 20:14.590
SO I REALLY DON'T SEE
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS HERE.

20:14.690 --> 20:17.170
- THE PROBLEM
IS I CHOSE AN ADDICT

20:17.280 --> 20:18.895
TO BE THE FATHER
OF MY CHILDREN,

20:19.010 --> 20:24.209
AND I WORRY EVERY DAY THAT
THEY HAVE THAT IN THEM TOO.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.528
SO PLEASE...

20:27.640 --> 20:31.041
LET ME HANDLE THIS, OKAY?

20:31.160 --> 20:33.082
- OKAY.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.398
- THANK YOU.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.209
- JUST LET ME ANSWER THE DOOR.
- WE'LL GET THE DOOR.

20:49.310 --> 20:50.868
- WE GOT IT, WE GOT IT.

20:50.970 --> 20:52.244
- HI, ALEX.

20:52.350 --> 20:53.271
- HEY, HOW YOU GUYS DOING?
- HOW ARE YOU?

20:53.390 --> 20:54.516
- THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

20:54.630 --> 20:55.790
- HI, I'M KRISTINA.
- HELLO, PLEASURE.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.288
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- SMELLS GREAT IN HERE.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.311
- I COOKED ALL DAY.
- THANK YOU.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.354
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO BRING FLOWERS.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.940
- WELL, THEY'RE NOT
ACTUALLY FOR YOU.

21:03.050 --> 21:04.631
THEY'RE FOCRJI-TOUR MOM.

21:04.740 --> 21:05.729
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

21:05.850 --> 21:08.045
THAT IS SO SWEET OF YOU.
THANK YOU.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.252
- IS THIS HADDIE'S BOYFRIEND?

21:09.370 --> 21:11.884
- UH, THIS IS MY BROTHER MAX.

21:11.990 --> 21:12.775
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:12.890 --> 21:14.289
I HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU,
LITTLE MAN.

21:14.410 --> 21:17.538
- YOU'RE BLACK.

21:17.650 --> 21:19.857
- SORRY, I'M SURE HADDIE
TOLD YOU ABOUT MAX.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.404
- MAX, THAT IS NOT POLITE.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.306
- NO, IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

21:23.420 --> 21:25.820
I AM BLACK.
TECHNICALLY A LITTLE BROWN.

21:25.930 --> 21:27.795
- YOU KNOW, MY UNCLE CROSBY'S
MARRYING A BLACK WOMAN,

21:27.900 --> 21:29.242
AND THEY HAVE A SON
WHO'S HALF-BLACK.

21:29.350 --> 21:31.079
AND IF YOU AND HADDIE
HAD A KID,

21:31.180 --> 21:32.249
HE'D LOOK JUST LIKE JABBAR.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.316
- OH, WE'RE GONNA GO
AND CHECK THE CHICKEN.

21:34.430 --> 21:35.249
- JABBAR WOULD HAVE A TWIN.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.248
WOULDN'T THAT BE
SO AWESOME, GUYS?

21:37.360 --> 21:38.520
- THAT'S PROBABLY
NOT GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.291
- YEAH, PROBABLY NOT.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.368
- SO THE COOL THING
ABOUT THE HERCULES BEETLE

21:43.470 --> 21:45.392
IS THAT IT'S
SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC.

21:45.510 --> 21:46.704
- HMM, I KNEW THERE
WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL

21:46.820 --> 21:47.639
ABOUT THAT BEETLE.

21:47.750 --> 21:48.910
- NOW THE FEMALE
HERCULES BEETLE

21:49.030 --> 21:50.782
DOES NOT HAVE HORNS.

21:50.890 --> 21:54.098
IT'S LARGER-BODIED
BUT SHORTER THAN THE MALE.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.272
YEAH, I HAVE A BOOK IN MY ROOM
THAT SHOWS YOU THE DIFFERENCE.

21:57.380 --> 21:58.893
- WELL, THAT'S COOL.
I WANT TO SEE IT.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.444
YOU KNOW, I LIKE BUGS TOO.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.959
I HAD TO LIVE WITH THEM
SOMETIMES GROWING UP.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.379
- WHY?

22:04.490 --> 22:06.799
- BECAUSE BUGS TEND TO LIVE
IN OLD BUILDINGS,

22:06.910 --> 22:08.798
BUILDINGS THAT HAVEN'T REALLY
BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.

22:11.430 --> 22:12.943
- OH, YOU'RE POOR.

22:13.050 --> 22:15.496
- MAX.
I'M SO SORRY.

22:15.610 --> 22:17.180
- IT'S--IT'S ALL RIGHT.

22:17.300 --> 22:18.847
I PREFER HONESTY IN PEOPLE.

22:18.950 --> 22:21.646
- SO ALEX, HOW DID YOU GET
INVOLVED WITH THE FOOD BANK?

22:21.750 --> 22:24.218
- UM, THAT'S A FUNNY STORY.

22:24.340 --> 22:26.570
I--I USED TO EAT THERE.

22:26.690 --> 22:28.612
- REALLY?

22:28.720 --> 22:30.130
- YEAH, THAT PLACE
SAVED MY LIFE.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.515
- WOW.

22:32.620 --> 22:34.485
THAT'S SOMETHING.

22:34.590 --> 22:37.388
- YEAH, MY MOM PASSED AWAY
A FEW YEARS AGO,

22:37.490 --> 22:38.514
AND IT WAS--

22:38.630 --> 22:39.790
- SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

22:39.910 --> 22:41.172
- REALLY SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

22:41.290 --> 22:42.245
- THANKS, NO, IT'S OKAY.
I'M ALL RIGHT.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.213
IT WAS A WHILE AGO.

22:43.320 --> 22:46.118
BUT MY DAD,

22:46.220 --> 22:47.391
HE NEVER REALLY RECOVERED.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.321
HE WAS IN A BAD PLACE.

22:50.430 --> 22:53.126
HAD SOME--SOME DEMONS

22:53.230 --> 22:55.881
HE COULDN'T GET RID OF.

22:55.990 --> 22:57.298
HE WOULDN'T GET HELP.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.128
SO I ATE
QUITE A FEW MEALS THERE.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.309
- WOW.

23:05.410 --> 23:07.207
- MUST HAVE BEEN
A DIFFICULT TIME.

23:07.310 --> 23:08.686
- I MEAN, IT WAS.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.825
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE PEOPLE'S
CHOICES FOR THEM, RIGHT?

23:10.940 --> 23:13.898
SO WHEN I WAS 16,

23:14.010 --> 23:15.591
I EMANCIPATED MYSELF.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.351
- MM-HMM,
WHICH WAS REALLY BRAVE.

23:18.460 --> 23:20.428
- SO YOU'VE BEEN LIVING
LIKE AN ADULT

23:20.530 --> 23:22.418
SINCE YOU WERE HADDIE'S AGE?

23:22.530 --> 23:24.157
16?
- MM-HMM.

23:24.260 --> 23:26.296
- WOW.
- VERY IMPRESSIVE.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.492
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

23:27.610 --> 23:29.362
I MEAN,
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,

23:29.470 --> 23:31.358
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS
GETTING MYSELF INTO.

23:31.470 --> 23:33.199
- YEAH.
- BUT I'M IN A GOOD PLACE NOW.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.302
I'M GETTING MY CREDITS TOGETHER
TO FINISH HIGH SCHOOL,

23:35.410 --> 23:37.503
MANAGING THE FOOD BANK.

23:37.620 --> 23:38.518
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO
IS HAVE A CAREER

23:38.620 --> 23:40.440
IN SOCIAL SERVICES.

23:40.550 --> 23:41.926
- OR POLITICS, REMEMBER?

23:42.040 --> 23:43.132
- OR POLITICS.

23:43.240 --> 23:45.379
BUT I REALLY WANT TO GIVE BACK
TO THE SYSTEM FIRST.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.139
- I KNOW, BUT I MEAN,
WE TALKED ABOUT

23:47.250 --> 23:48.239
YOU WOULD DO WELL.
- I GUESS.

23:48.350 --> 23:50.033
- WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE?

23:50.150 --> 23:51.287
- COLLEGE?
- YEP.

23:51.390 --> 23:52.459
- I'D LIKE THAT.

23:52.560 --> 23:55.449
I'D HAVE TO FIGURE
SOME THINGS OUT FIRST.

23:55.570 --> 23:57.424
BUT RIGHT NOW I REALLY WANT
TO GET THROUGH A YEAR

23:57.530 --> 23:58.349
ON THE PROGRAM.

23:58.470 --> 24:00.870
- WHAT PROGRAM?

24:00.990 --> 24:02.503
- I'M IN A.A.

24:06.370 --> 24:07.678
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

24:07.790 --> 24:09.052
I'VE HEARD IT BEFORE.

24:09.170 --> 24:12.264
- IT'S ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS.

24:12.380 --> 24:13.472
- SO YOU'RE AN ALCOHOLIC?

24:13.590 --> 24:14.750
- WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

24:14.860 --> 24:16.418
- WELL, YOU'RE ALWAYS
AN ALCOHOLIC.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.488
JUST I'VE BEEN SOBER
FOR SIX MONTHS.

24:18.590 --> 24:19.579
- GOOD FOR YOU.

24:19.690 --> 24:20.896
- YEAH, THIS IS REALLY BORING.

24:21.010 --> 24:23.342
MY BUG BOOK WOULD BE SO MUCH
MORE INTERESTING THAN THIS.

24:23.460 --> 24:24.836
I'M GONNA GO GET IT.

24:24.940 --> 24:26.146
- ALL RIGHT.

24:26.250 --> 24:27.979
- I JUST GOT
MY SIX-MONTH CHIP.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.308
HADDIE WENT WITH ME.

24:29.430 --> 24:30.283
- SHE DID?
CONGRATULATIONS.

24:30.390 --> 24:31.561
- THAT'S GREAT.

24:31.670 --> 24:32.978
YOU SHOULD BE
REALLY PROUD OF YOURSELF.

24:33.090 --> 24:34.773
THAT'S TOUGH TO DO.
- GOOD FOR YOU.

24:39.850 --> 24:41.192
- UM...

24:41.300 --> 24:44.679
I'M SOLID.

24:44.790 --> 24:47.258
I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW THAT.

24:47.380 --> 24:48.961
I GET THAT YOU GUYS
ARE PARENTS,

24:49.070 --> 24:55.589
AND I UNDERSTAND HOW CRAZY
ALL THIS MUST SOUND,

24:55.700 --> 24:58.931
BUT YOU GO DOWN THE ROAD
YOU GO DOWN WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER.

24:59.040 --> 25:02.248
YOU LEARN WHAT YOU LEARN
FROM WATCHING,

25:02.360 --> 25:05.284
IMITATING WHAT YOU SEE,
WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.539
BUT WHEN YOU GROW UP,

25:07.640 --> 25:10.393
YOU GET TO MAKE
YOUR OWN CHOICES,

25:10.500 --> 25:13.298
CHOICES THAT ARE GONNA
DEFINE WHO YOU ARE,

25:13.400 --> 25:15.539
YOUR MORALS,
WHAT YOU WILL STAND FOR,

25:15.650 --> 25:18.995
OR WHAT YOU'LL FALL FOR,

25:19.100 --> 25:21.648
WHO YOU WANT TO BE.

25:21.760 --> 25:26.447
WELL, I WANT TO BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU GUYS.

25:26.550 --> 25:30.998
SO THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME BE.

25:33.220 --> 25:34.903
- THANK YOU.

25:35.010 --> 25:37.592
- THANK YOU FOR BEING
SO HONEST.

25:48.510 --> 25:50.193
ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.403
- HMM?

25:51.510 --> 25:52.408
- I WAS VERY IMPRESSED
WITH HIM.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.023
- MM-HMM.

25:54.130 --> 25:55.472
- JUST THE WAY
HE HANDLES HIMSELF

25:55.580 --> 25:58.856
IS INCREDIBLY MATURE
AND DECENT.

25:58.970 --> 26:00.961
- YEAH.

26:01.070 --> 26:02.298
I AGREE.

26:02.420 --> 26:03.580
HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.076
- YEAH, IT'S AMAZING
HOW GROUNDED HE IS.

26:05.180 --> 26:07.557
- HE'S A GREAT GUY,
AND HE'S CHARMING.

26:07.660 --> 26:08.388
HE'S SWEET.

26:08.490 --> 26:09.525
- HE'S VERY NICE TO HADDIE.

26:09.630 --> 26:10.767
HE'S A HARD WORKER.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.007
HE'S OBVIOUSLY
A SMART KID.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.280
- HE'S VERY SMART.

26:13.390 --> 26:16.109
HE'S GRACIOUS.

26:16.220 --> 26:17.562
- [sighs]

26:17.670 --> 26:20.321
- I MEAN, HE LIVES BY HIMSELF.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.884
HE LIVES LIKE AN ADULT.

26:21.990 --> 26:23.150
- HE HAS HIS OWN PLACE.

26:23.270 --> 26:24.498
- HE DIDN'T FINISH
HIGH SCHOOL EITHER.

26:24.610 --> 26:25.850
- WELL, HE'S WORKING
ON THAT,

26:25.960 --> 26:27.120
AND, LOOK, I GIVE HIM
A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THAT

26:27.240 --> 26:28.810
AND FOR GETTING SOBER.
- YEAH, I DO TOO.

26:28.930 --> 26:30.716
- BUT ALL OF THAT,
IT'S JUST, IT'S TOO MUCH

26:30.830 --> 26:33.754
TO PUT ON THE PLATE
OF OUR 16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.100
- I COMPLETELY AGREE.

26:35.210 --> 26:37.246
IF SHE WERE 21 YEARS OLD,
DIFFERENT STORY.

26:37.350 --> 26:38.897
- TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
- COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

26:39.010 --> 26:41.387
BUT SHE'S NOT 21.
SHE'S 16.

26:41.490 --> 26:42.627
AND...

26:42.730 --> 26:45.597
- THAT'S WAY TOO YOUNG.

26:45.700 --> 26:46.940
- WE HAVE TO TELL HER TOMORROW.

26:47.050 --> 26:48.836
- IT'S BETTER TO END IT NOW

26:48.950 --> 26:50.668
THAN TO LET IT CONTINUE
AND GET SERIOUS.

26:50.780 --> 26:52.259
- IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.258
- DEFINITELY.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.929
- SHE'S GONNA HATE US.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.452
- SHE DIED?

27:21.570 --> 27:22.832
WHEN?

27:22.950 --> 27:27.603
- UH, JUST, LIKE,
AN HOUR AGO.

27:27.710 --> 27:29.701
- YEAH.

27:29.820 --> 27:32.846
- MAYBE IF WE PUT WATER ON HER,
SHE MIGHT WAKE UP.

27:34.790 --> 27:38.191
- ACTUALLY, SWEETIE,
NO, THAT'S--

27:38.310 --> 27:41.370
WHEN YOU DIE, THAT'S IT.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.721
- FOREVER?

27:45.590 --> 27:46.898
- YEAH.

27:47.010 --> 27:49.695
- WELL, THAT'S SAD.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.519
- IT IS--IT IS SAD, BUG.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.427
IT IS SAD.

27:54.530 --> 27:56.839
- SO EVERYTHING DIES?

27:56.950 --> 27:58.668
- YEAH, PRETTY MUCH, HON.

27:58.780 --> 28:00.771
BUT, YOU KNOW, UM,

28:00.880 --> 28:03.815
THAT'S KINDA THE BEAUTY
OF THE WORLD.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.742
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT PERMANENT.

28:07.850 --> 28:10.819
- ARE YOU AND DADDY
GONNA DIE?

28:10.930 --> 28:13.649
AM I GONNA DIE?

28:13.760 --> 28:17.969
- NOT FOR A REALLY, REALLY
LONG TIME.

28:18.070 --> 28:19.139
- YEAH.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.936
- LIKE 100 YEARS.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.725
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE.
I WOULD MISS YOU.

28:29.980 --> 28:31.254
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO,

28:31.360 --> 28:34.773
BECAUSE WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER
IN HEAVEN.

28:36.160 --> 28:40.153
HEAVEN IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE,

28:40.270 --> 28:42.329
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GO
WHEN YOU DIE.

28:42.440 --> 28:44.601
IT'S PEACEFUL THERE.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.472
AND IT'S HAPPY.

28:46.580 --> 28:48.639
AND EVERYONE THAT YOU LOVE,

28:48.760 --> 28:50.409
EVERYONE THAT YOU MISS

28:50.520 --> 28:53.102
IS THERE WAITING FOR YOU.

28:53.210 --> 28:55.656
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER THIS,

28:55.760 --> 29:00.345
BUT WHEN YOU WERE
REALLY LITTLE

29:00.460 --> 29:04.806
DADDY'S MOM DIED.

29:04.910 --> 29:08.630
AND SHE'S THERE.

29:08.740 --> 29:11.800
AND YOU GET TO SEE HER
WHEN YOU GO

29:11.920 --> 29:14.844
IN 100 YEARS.

29:16.470 --> 29:19.815
- OKAY, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

29:19.930 --> 29:21.579
WILL AMELIA BE THERE?

29:21.690 --> 29:23.066
- YEP.

29:23.170 --> 29:24.751
ABSOLUTELY.

29:24.860 --> 29:27.476
SHE'S PROBABLY THERE ALREADY
WITH YOUR GRANDMA.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.869
- OKAY.

29:43.710 --> 29:45.769
- YOU JUST LIKE HER BECAUSE
SHE HAS BIG, BLUE EYES.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.120
- HEY, YOU GUYS.

29:47.230 --> 29:48.629
- SHE LIKES YOU.
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.023
- I WOULD HAVE TO KNOW
FOR CERTAIN

29:52.130 --> 29:53.813
THAT SHE FELT THE SAME WAY.
- SHE DOES.

29:53.930 --> 29:54.999
- YOU GUYS,
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO--

29:55.100 --> 29:56.681
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN THE RIGHT TIME IS

29:56.790 --> 29:57.779
TO BRING THIS UP EXACTLY,

29:57.890 --> 29:59.164
BUT I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO TALK TO YOU.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.680
- SHE'S REALLY CUTE BUT JUST
MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT SETTLING.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.960
- HEY!
HEY, GUYS.

30:03.070 --> 30:07.029
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.

30:07.150 --> 30:08.720
- YEAH, OKAY, SORRY,
IT'S A LITTLE LATE.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.000
- I KNOW, YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

30:10.110 --> 30:11.429
I KNOW HOW SMART YOU ARE,
OKAY?

30:11.530 --> 30:12.838
- SHE'S ON BOTH RIGHT NOW.
- I JUST WANT TO SAY--

30:12.940 --> 30:14.214
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE DREW,
WHEN THE--

30:14.320 --> 30:15.708
THE THING WITH THE BEER
AND STUFF.

30:15.810 --> 30:16.708
- WHAT THING WITH THE BEER?

30:16.810 --> 30:18.493
ARE YOU DRINKING BEER?

30:18.600 --> 30:19.840
WHY DIDN'T YOU INVITE ME?

30:19.950 --> 30:20.678
YOU COULDA SENT ME
A TEXT MESSAGE.

30:20.780 --> 30:22.088
- LISTEN, YOU GUYS,
PLEASE.

30:22.190 --> 30:23.919
- WHAT?

30:24.020 --> 30:26.648
- YOUR FATHER HAD PROBLEMS
IN THIS AREA.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.741
A LOT.

30:28.860 --> 30:31.613
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT CAN BE

30:31.720 --> 30:35.781
A HEREDITARY KIND OF
PROBLEM.

30:35.900 --> 30:39.518
YOU HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL
THAN OTHER KIDS.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.621
YOU KNOW THAT, DREW?
- YEAH.

30:41.730 --> 30:45.314
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- YEAH.

30:45.420 --> 30:46.864
- DO YOU HEAR ME?

30:46.980 --> 30:48.732
- YEAH, I THINK I HEAR YOU.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.708
- YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.914
- I'LL BE CAREFUL.

30:59.130 --> 31:01.121
- JABBAR, I'M REALLY
PROUD OF YOU.

31:01.230 --> 31:02.674
YOUR ROOM LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

31:02.790 --> 31:06.135
- DADDY CLEANED MY ROOM.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.753
HE SAID IT WAS OUR SECRET.

31:07.860 --> 31:09.441
- OH, HE DID, HUH?
YOU CLEANED HIS ROOM?

31:09.550 --> 31:12.724
- UH, NO, THAT'S NOT--
I JUST HELPED.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.582
- NO, YOU DID THE WHOLE THING.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.931
- WELL, IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT

31:18.040 --> 31:19.905
THAT I MIGHT
HAVE DONE MOST OF.

31:20.010 --> 31:21.693
- FINISH UP WITH THIS, OKAY?

31:21.810 --> 31:25.940
- OKAY.

31:26.050 --> 31:29.326
- THAT IS TOTALLY NOT COOL.

31:29.430 --> 31:30.636
IT'S NOT COOL!

31:30.750 --> 31:32.957
- I DID NOT MEAN TO DO IT.
IT JUST HAPPENED, OKAY?

31:33.060 --> 31:34.880
IT WAS THE EASIEST THING
TO DO IN THE MOMENT.

31:34.990 --> 31:36.912
- EASY IS NOT GOOD PARENTING,
AND EASY IS LAZY.

31:37.030 --> 31:38.429
AND YOU'RE TEACHING HIM
BAD HABITS.

31:38.550 --> 31:40.541
- OH, I'M A LAZY BAD PARENT
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

31:40.650 --> 31:42.789
THAT A DIRTY ROOM FOR
A SIX-YEAR-OLD IS A BIG DEAL?

31:42.900 --> 31:44.037
I THINK IT'S STUPID.

31:44.140 --> 31:46.131
- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH A CLEAN ROOM OR EVEN HIM.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.104
IT'S YOU.

31:47.210 --> 31:49.064
YOU WON'T DISCIPLINE.

31:49.180 --> 31:50.966
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE LIKED
AND BE THE GOOD GUY

31:51.080 --> 31:52.274
AND LEAVING ME
WITH THE DIRTY WORK.

31:52.390 --> 31:53.869
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

31:53.980 --> 31:57.006
YOU'RE NOT HIS FRIEND.
YOU'RE HIS FATHER.

31:59.260 --> 32:00.568
- EVEN, LIKE, A RESTAURANT
THAT HAS A BAR.

32:00.670 --> 32:02.638
WE DON'T HAVE TO--
- YEAH, THAT'S NUMBER TWO.

32:02.740 --> 32:04.776
- OR WE COULD GO TO A CLUB
AND DANCE OR SOMETHING.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.745
- WE'LL FIND SOMEPLACE TO GO,
AND WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF FUN.

32:06.850 --> 32:07.987
AND GUESS WHAT,
WHEREVER WE ARE GOING

32:08.090 --> 32:10.479
I WILL BE DRINKING SOME MORE.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.992
- MMM.

32:15.310 --> 32:18.655
- BECAUSE I'M NOT PREGNANT.

32:20.830 --> 32:22.969
- OKAY.

32:23.070 --> 32:27.973
- YEP, ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN
TRYING FOR FOUR MONTHS.

32:28.870 --> 32:30.974
- OH.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.116
_ THIS IS GONNA BE BETTER,
RIGHT?

32:33.220 --> 32:35.359
- VERY NICE.
- THANK YOU.

32:35.470 --> 32:39.054
I DON'T KNOW,
THE REAL KIND OF BUMMER

32:39.160 --> 32:41.048
IS THAT I KEEP THINKING
THAT I AM PREGNANT,

32:41.160 --> 32:43.390
AND THEN I START
TO GET ALL SENTIMENTAL

32:43.510 --> 32:45.740
AND I THINK THAT
THERE'S ACT UALLY--

32:45.860 --> 32:47.168
THERE'S A BABY
INSIDE OF ME,

32:47.270 --> 32:49.818
AND IT KIND OF BREAKS MY HEART
EVERY TIME THERE'S NOT.

32:49.930 --> 32:51.921
SO ANYWAY...

32:52.030 --> 32:55.340
WHEN DID IT GET SO HARD
TO GET PREGNANT?

32:55.450 --> 32:57.827
- I WASN'T REALLY
INTENDING IT EITHER TIME,

32:57.940 --> 33:00.488
SO...

33:00.590 --> 33:01.386
- RIGHT.

33:01.490 --> 33:03.663
SEE, THAT'S ALL
I NEED TO DO,

33:03.770 --> 33:06.830
NOT WANT TO GET PREGNANT.

33:06.950 --> 33:09.498
- DAD GAVE DREW
A BEER THE OTHER DAY,

33:09.600 --> 33:15.744
AND I REALIZED
I HAVE TO TELL THEM WHAT...

33:15.850 --> 33:16.987
THE REAL STORY IS.

33:17.090 --> 33:20.605
THAT THEIR FATHER
COULD BE MISSING

33:20.720 --> 33:21.675
FOR DAYS AT A TIME,

33:21.790 --> 33:26.136
AND HE WASN'T ON TOUR
LIKE I SAID, YOU KNOW?

33:28.350 --> 33:30.489
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO TELL THEM

33:30.590 --> 33:31.966
HOW BAD IT ACTUALLY WAS.

33:32.070 --> 33:33.958
DON'T WANT THEM TO BE AFRAID,
YOU KNOW?

33:34.080 --> 33:35.308
- YEAH.

33:35.420 --> 33:38.969
- HOW MUCH TRUTH
IS TOO MUCH TRUTH?

33:39.080 --> 33:41.765
- YES, OR ENOUGH,
BUT NOT TOO MUCH.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.348
YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE THING,
AGAIN, WITH SYDNEY

33:44.470 --> 33:47.359
AND THE AFTERLIFE
AND THE DEATH AND THE BIRD.

33:47.470 --> 33:48.801
- THE BIRD?

33:48.920 --> 33:50.535
- WHY DID THAT DUMB BIRD
HAVE TO DIE?

33:50.640 --> 33:52.915
I MEAN, COULDN'T IT
HAVE JUST HEALED ITSELF?

33:53.030 --> 33:54.224
WOULD THAT HAVE KILLED IT?

33:54.340 --> 33:55.819
- BIRDS ARE SO SELF-CENTERED.

33:55.930 --> 33:57.124
- YES.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.639
AND THEN POOR JOEL
HAS TO DEAL WITH ME

33:58.760 --> 34:00.819
BEING SO CONTROLLING,
WHICH I HATE ABOUT MYSELF.

34:00.930 --> 34:02.306
BUT, I MEAN,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

34:02.410 --> 34:04.867
- YOU SHOULD GET THOSE
CONTROL ISSUES UNDER CONTROL.

34:04.970 --> 34:06.107
- THANKS.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.939
- YOU SHOULD REALLY
CONTROL THOSE BETTER.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.655
UH-OH.

34:09.770 --> 34:12.000
- IT'S OKAY TO COME IN?

34:12.110 --> 34:13.862
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

34:13.980 --> 34:15.117
HI, POPS.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.972
- [chuckles]

34:17.080 --> 34:18.809
WELL, NOW THAT'S INTERESTING.

34:18.910 --> 34:21.219
SEE, I KEEP WALKING INTO
DIFFERENT ROOMS IN MY HOUSE

34:21.330 --> 34:24.436
AND FINDING PEOPLE DRINKING.

34:24.540 --> 34:26.462
SHOULD I BE TAKING IT
PERSONALLY?

34:26.580 --> 34:27.399
IS IT A BAD TIME?

34:27.510 --> 34:28.989
- COME IN, DAD,
AND HAVE A DRINK.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.476
- RIGHT, OKAY.

34:30.580 --> 34:34.858
- I WILL GET YOU A DRINK,
THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO.

34:36.970 --> 34:39.416
- ARE WE OKAY?

34:42.140 --> 34:45.109
- SO...

34:45.220 --> 34:46.721
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?

34:46.840 --> 34:49.217
- THAT'S GOOD.
- OOH-OOH-OOH.

34:55.090 --> 34:56.773
- OKAY, MAY I SAY SOMETHING?

34:56.880 --> 34:59.087
- PLEASE.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.579
- YOU TWO LADIES HAVE DONE
AN INCREDIBLE JOB

35:02.680 --> 35:06.309
BEING PARENTS.

35:06.410 --> 35:11.689
AND I AM SO PROUD
TO HAVE YOU TWO

35:11.790 --> 35:14.896
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.

35:17.110 --> 35:19.590
- THAN KS, DAD.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.217
- DAD.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.764
- WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
PARTYING RIGHT NOW,

35:24.880 --> 35:26.495
NOT CRYING, JEEZ.
- IT'S GIRLS' NIGHT, DAD.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.046
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THINKING
ABOUT BOYS AND LIPSTICK.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.013
- I THINK
I SHOULD GO WITH YOU.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.769
- I DO TOO.
- YOU'RE ALL GUSSIED UP.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.939
- LET'S GO DANCING.
WE'LL TAKE DAD DANCING.

35:34.060 --> 35:35.743
- YEAH.

35:40.650 --> 35:43.164
- YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAD A LONG TALK LAST NIGHT.

35:43.270 --> 35:47.969
AND WE HAVE DECIDED THAT

35:48.070 --> 35:50.482
IT'S BEST IF YOU DON'T
SEE ALEX ANYMORE.

35:58.770 --> 36:00.943
- UH, IS THIS BECAUSE
HE'S BLACK?

36:01.050 --> 36:03.769
- HADDIE, COME ON, YOUR MOTHER
AND I ARE NOT RACISTS.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.677
- NOT AT ALL, HONEY.

36:05.780 --> 36:08.396
- THEN I--WHY?

36:08.510 --> 36:11.297
'CAUSE HE WAS SITTING HERE
AND YOU LIKED HIM.

36:11.410 --> 36:13.298
I SAW YOU LIKED HIM.
- HE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON,

36:13.410 --> 36:15.685
BUT IT'S JUST--
- RIGHT, SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

36:15.790 --> 36:17.098
- WE FEEL THAT HE'S
TOO OLD FOR YOU.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.270
- HE'S JUST--
HE'S TOO GROWN-UP.

36:19.380 --> 36:21.519
YOU KNOW, HE HAS NO PARENTS
IN HIS LIFE.

36:21.620 --> 36:23.417
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
SO?

36:23.520 --> 36:24.999
- HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

36:25.110 --> 36:26.828
I GIVE HIM A LOT OF CREDIT
FOR WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOW.

36:26.940 --> 36:27.861
- THE A.A. THING,
IT'S SCARY.

36:27.970 --> 36:29.483
- THIS IS TOO ADULT
A RELATIONSHIP FOR YOU.

36:29.600 --> 36:30.976
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ATTENDING
A.A. MEETINGS.

36:31.080 --> 36:34.117
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GONNA HAPPEN?

36:34.220 --> 36:36.871
- I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH
HIM HAVING HIS OWN APARTMENT.

36:36.980 --> 36:39.221
- WHY DOES IT MATTER
WHAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH?

36:39.330 --> 36:42.083
I FEEL COMFORTABLE,
AND I FEEL HAPPY.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.191
- WE'RE YOUR PARENTS.
- NO! I DON'T CARE!

36:44.300 --> 36:45.813
WHY DO YOU GUYS
GET TO TELL ME--

36:45.920 --> 36:48.024
- WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.
- HADDIE, I'M SORRY.

36:48.130 --> 36:50.883
I'M SORRY.
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.513
WE HAVE MADE OUR MINDS UP.
- PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

36:52.620 --> 36:54.781
- YOU ARE NOT
TO SEE ALEX ANYMORE.

37:03.770 --> 37:06.284
- WE'RE SORRY.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.630
GREAT.
[door slams]

37:21.860 --> 37:25.091
- [yawns]

37:25.200 --> 37:27.304
- PATH ETIC.

37:27.410 --> 37:29.344
WE DIDN'T PARTY
LIKE IT WAS 1999.

37:29.450 --> 37:32.135
WE DIDN'T EVEN PARTY
LIKE IT WAS 1998.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.797
- PHEW, GOOD MORNING!

37:33.900 --> 37:35.174
HEY!

37:35.280 --> 37:36.486
HOW WAS GIRLS' NIGHT OUT?

37:36.590 --> 37:38.455
- PATHETIC.
- WE DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.039
- WE DIDN'T MAKE IT
OUT OF THE HOUSE, DAD.

37:40.150 --> 37:41.310
- OH.

37:41.430 --> 37:42.624
- HOW COME YOU'RE NOT
HUNG OVER?

37:42.740 --> 37:44.594
- OH, COME ON,
THAT WAS GIRLY DRINKING.

37:44.710 --> 37:46.803
AMATEUR HOUR.

37:46.910 --> 37:47.877
- OKAY.

37:47.980 --> 37:49.186
- OH, THIS IS HAZELNUT.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.325
MAN, GAH!

37:51.440 --> 37:53.772
I HATE HAZELN UT.

37:53.890 --> 37:57.166
- HE'S RIGHT, WE'RE
FLAVORED-COFFEE-BREWING LOSERS.

37:57.270 --> 37:58.612
- OKAY, I'M GONNA GO HOME

37:58.720 --> 38:00.119
SO MY HUSBAND
CAN MAKE FUN OF ME.

38:00.240 --> 38:02.128
- OKAY, BUT WE'RE GONNA
DO THIS AGAIN NEXT WEEK, RIGHT?

38:02.240 --> 38:04.162
- YEAH.
- IT'S GIRLS' NIGHT.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.555
THIS IS THE YEAR OF FUN.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.208
IT'S THE YEAR OF FUN, RIGHT?

38:09.320 --> 38:11.311
WHOO!

38:16.430 --> 38:19.217
- HEY!
[whistles]

38:19.330 --> 38:21.776
HEAD 'EM UP,
MOVE 'EM OUT.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.188
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

38:23.300 --> 38:24.369
- I DON'T KNOW,
GETTING SOME AIR.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.256
WE'LL GO TAKE A HIKE.
WHATEVER WE WANNA DO.

38:26.370 --> 38:27.814
I KNOW WE'RE GONNA
GET IN THAT TRUCK.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.262
I KNOW, WE'LL GO HAVE
SOME COFFEE,

38:29.370 --> 38:31.930
BECAUSE MEN DRINK COFFEE.

38:32.030 --> 38:33.167
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

38:33.270 --> 38:34.999
- YEAH, I GUESS.
THAT MAKES SENSE.

38:35.100 --> 38:38.752
- I MEAN, NOT ALL MALE BONDING
IS DONE OVER BEER.

38:38.860 --> 38:39.827
A LOT OF IT IS.

38:39.930 --> 38:41.795
I MEAN, PROBABLY
WAY TOO MUCH OF IT.

38:41.900 --> 38:45.313
YEAH, BUT HERE'S
THE IMPORTANT THING.

38:45.420 --> 38:48.833
MEN DON'T SQUEAL
ON ONE ANOTHER.

38:48.940 --> 38:50.077
ALL RIGHT?

38:50.180 --> 38:51.659
EVEN UNDER TORTURE.

38:51.770 --> 38:53.214
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:53.330 --> 38:56.117
- YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE
CHATTY KATHY.

38:56.230 --> 38:57.356
HERE, HOP IN.

38:57.470 --> 38:58.494
I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

39:05.130 --> 39:07.337

39:41.030 --> 39:42.236
I KINDA HATE YOU FOR THAT.

39:42.340 --> 39:43.682
- OH, I LOVE YOU.

39:43.790 --> 39:45.781

39:50.450 --> 39:53.078

YOU'RE SWEATING ALCOHOL.

39:53.180 --> 39:54.761
- MM-HMM.

39:54.870 --> 39:57.031

YOU LOOK GOOD.

40:01.220 --> 40:03.108
- OH.

40:03.220 --> 40:04.733
- EXPECTING SOMETHING

40:04.850 --> 40:06.226
SOMETHING BETTER
THAN BEFORE

40:06.330 --> 40:08.912
- [makes blasting sounds]

40:09.020 --> 40:11.648
- JABBAR, I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM A WALRUS

40:11.750 --> 40:14.218
WHO WANTS TO KNOW WHEN WE'RE
GONNA BE GETTING TO THE ZOO.

40:14.340 --> 40:15.614
OH, MY--

40:15.720 --> 40:17.859
BUDDY, WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

40:17.960 --> 40:19.188
IT WAS JUST CLEAN.

40:19.310 --> 40:20.299
- YOU COULD CLEAN
MY ROOM AGAIN.

40:20.410 --> 40:21.889
IT CAN BE OUR SECRET.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.729
- NO, NO, WE'RE NOT DOING
THAT AGAIN, BUDDY.

40:23.830 --> 40:25.582
- I'LL CLEAN IT UP
AFTER THE ZOO.

40:25.690 --> 40:28.079
- NO, YOU NEED
TO CLEAN IT UP NOW.

40:28.180 --> 40:29.909
- NO!

40:30.010 --> 40:32.524

40:32.630 --> 40:34.598
YOU HAVE TO CLEAN
YOUR ROOM NOW,

40:34.700 --> 40:38.010
OR WE CAN'T GO TO THE ZOO.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.987

40:41.090 --> 40:45.151
LISTEN, JABBAR, YOU HAVE

- HEY, WHAT--DON'T.

40:48.890 --> 40:51.541
THEN WE'RE NOT
GOING TO THE ZOO.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.538
- THAT'S NOT FAIR!
- YES, IT IS FAIR.

40:53.650 --> 40:55.515
WHAT'S NOT FAIR IS ME LETTING
YOU JUST GO THROUGH LIFE

40:55.620 --> 40:57.349
THINKING THAT SOMEONE'S
GONNA DO EVERYTHING

40:57.450 --> 40:58.519
YOU NEED DOING, OKAY?

40:58.620 --> 40:59.996
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
A CRAPPY DAD.

41:00.110 --> 41:02.624
- FINE, I'LL CLEAN IT.

41:02.730 --> 41:04.209
OKAY, I'M CLEANING.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.744
WHAT'D THEY THINK ABOUT ME?
DID I PASS?

41:56.820 --> 41:58.264
- THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE
REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

41:58.370 --> 42:00.429
- IMPRESSIVE?

42:00.550 --> 42:02.336
[both chuckle]

42:02.450 --> 42:03.303
I MEAN, THAT'S IT?

42:06.480 --> 42:10.416

A HAND IN THE KITCHEN?

42:21.330 --> 42:22.217
