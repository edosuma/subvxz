00:20.896 --> 00:22.982
Per the Special Anti-Terrorism Measures Act,

00:23.190 --> 00:26.485
we now place all terminals in the designated
area under Public Security's electronic control.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.903
"Give back our water!"

00:27.903 --> 00:29.363
Anticipating that cyberterrorism against
Harimadara Heavy Industries will lead

00:29.572 --> 00:32.867
--to a shutdown of operations, Home
Affairs has... --HQ to Squad 357.

00:33.075 --> 00:35.453
Transfer command to Section 9.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.705
This is Priority One.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.792
Murderers!

00:42.001 --> 00:43.961
Murderers!!

00:44.170 --> 00:45.588
Give back our water!

00:45.796 --> 00:47.882
--Give back our water!!
--Despite increasingly fierce protests,

00:48.090 --> 00:50.092
a contract has just been signed

00:50.301 --> 00:54.472
between a Kuzan water company
and the Japanese giant Harimadara.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.115
"Give water to the war orphans!!"

01:13.115 --> 01:15.534
"Give water to the war orphans!"

01:24.293 --> 01:26.087
It's starting.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.672
All channels within the revised limits are clear.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.509
All Home Affairs and MLIT lines
now under our control.

01:31.717 --> 01:32.802
Ready for domination.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.595
Begin.

01:53.447 --> 01:58.536
All lifelines, surveillance, etc. for
the building and roads now dominated.

01:58.744 --> 02:03.040
Profiling cyberbrains and terminals
of 4,022 people in the area.

02:03.249 --> 02:05.835
1,102 require follow-up.

02:06.043 --> 02:10.172
Aramaki! I'm not giving you my crime scene!

02:10.381 --> 02:14.385
This is Section 6. Who said you
could infiltrate our comm lines?!

02:14.593 --> 02:19.431
We need to prevent casualties,
not play departmental musical chairs!

02:19.640 --> 02:24.353
Or will you take the fall when we can't
even pin down their means of attack?!

02:24.562 --> 02:27.064
Chief Aramaki, explain yourself.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.108
Vice-Minister Kitahara.

02:29.316 --> 02:33.028
I thought you were attending
the celebratory banquet?

02:33.237 --> 02:35.698
What you warned me of is happening, then?

02:35.906 --> 02:41.579
We got an anonymous tip that a Qhardi
group mobilized three hours ago.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.038
Anonymous?

02:43.247 --> 02:45.457
Can you trust it?

02:45.666 --> 02:51.046
Yes. The Yotsubashi Building
area is definitely the target.

02:51.255 --> 02:56.051
The old ape's sure fired up,
considering we're flying blind here.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.555
Batou, this is the outfit
we've been after ever since

02:59.763 --> 03:02.433
the cyber-contamination
at Harimadara four months ago.

03:02.641 --> 03:05.644
"We"? You mean you.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.564
Did you make this, Major?

03:08.772 --> 03:11.275
It ain't a toy, rookie.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.903
It's a military-grade virtual comm link.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.488
It's almost impossible for hackers to listen in.

03:17.489 --> 03:20.910
Section <i>9</i> forced the domination through.
We'll have orders soon.

03:21.118 --> 03:25.748
Nab one of the terrorists.
I want bait to draw out our prey.

03:25.956 --> 03:31.587
Is it that super-wizard-class
hacker, Fire-Starter?

03:33.297 --> 03:36.425
Isn't that just what you want?

03:36.634 --> 03:39.762
We don't even know if there's
really someone pulling the strings.

03:39.970 --> 03:43.307
What I want is to formally
establish my spec ops team.

03:43.515 --> 03:46.018
If you're scared of unknown enemies, drop out.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.728
Piss off.

03:49.104 --> 03:55.319
"Corporate Killers"

03:55.319 --> 03:55.778
You're the only one that green.

03:55.986 --> 03:59.031
Our status as an independent
offensive unit is riding on this.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.785
Public Security handles the incident,
and we handle what caused it.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.495
Go.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.103
The enemy just gave the go-ahead.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.813
Capture them!

05:17.860 --> 05:22.781
You deserve this...
Greedy rich-country bastards!

05:31.457 --> 05:35.127
Today, we've followed
the principle of free trade

05:35.336 --> 05:39.298
to maintain fair prices that will
spur postwar economic recovery.

05:44.928 --> 05:48.349
This was his only weapon. Something's fishy.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.451
The riot squad opened fire?!

06:33.519 --> 06:36.063
The west team's slaughtering protesters.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.357
Some are even shooting other cops!

06:38.565 --> 06:40.943
It's the biggest simultaneous Ghost Hack ever.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.946
It's crazy, but it's the only explanation.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.366
There's no tech that'd
control 100 people at once.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.868
The perps on my watch are all dead, too.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.747
Check the riot squad's lines and
find out what caused the attack.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.833
There's a log that might be Starter's, but...

06:56.041 --> 06:58.377
Then this isn't hacking. It's a virus.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.754
I don't see one in the sequence.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.674
It's a self-destructing Stuxnet-type.

07:03.882 --> 07:08.720
Someone must be sending packaged
actions meant to control groups.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.741
You, eh?

07:37.666 --> 07:42.296
I made a deal with the devil for the
sake of rebuilding and independence!

07:42.504 --> 07:45.299
Just like you wanted!

07:45.507 --> 07:48.677
And it invited a second
slaughter by water and e-money

07:48.886 --> 07:52.931
to follow the first slaughter with guns!

07:53.140 --> 07:55.225
--You said cyberbrain tech and the prosthetics
industry --I want a media blackout now.

07:55.434 --> 07:56.768
--Would build us a future,
--This is Priority One!

07:56.977 --> 08:00.856
But hope wasn't what they
brought to Qhardistan!

08:01.064 --> 08:03.484
They merely sowed the seeds of betrayal

08:03.692 --> 08:06.236
that would grow to bleed
away my people's pride!

08:06.445 --> 08:09.406
Have a taste of what that felt like!

08:09.615 --> 08:13.202
Then you'll have no choice
but to grant me asylum!

08:13.410 --> 08:17.122
Because this is a civilized, pacifist nation!

08:17.331 --> 08:19.041
Oh, is it?

08:56.662 --> 08:58.789
Optical camouflage!

08:58.997 --> 09:01.667
You can't stop Fire-Starter.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.836
Someone hacked my line?!

09:16.807 --> 09:17.599
Major?!

09:17.808 --> 09:19.309
Saito!

09:31.572 --> 09:33.115
Shit.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.420
Hello!

09:48.880 --> 09:49.923
Give me a weapon!

09:50.132 --> 09:51.258
Okay!

09:51.466 --> 09:53.343
Major, I'll be right there!

09:53.552 --> 09:56.847
Don't be stupid. Go after
the one who hacked me!

10:12.154 --> 10:13.697
On your knees!

10:14.823 --> 10:18.035
I'll shoot you dead if you resist.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.928
That was outta nowhere!

10:37.137 --> 10:40.057
This was your job, moron!

10:42.643 --> 10:44.645
Sorry! That was an accident.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.022
Equip some handrails!

10:49.775 --> 10:51.568
Do it, Saito.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.247
I let him get away, sorry!

11:16.343 --> 11:18.428
"Section <i>9</i> Office"

11:18.428 --> 11:18.887
Idiots!

11:20.347 --> 11:24.810
You finally take the job, and then you
execute someone on the national Net?

11:25.018 --> 11:27.896
Who, me? You have no proof.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.148
Are you claiming you had no choice?

11:30.357 --> 11:33.360
You're a super-wizard-class
hacker in an ace unit.

11:33.568 --> 11:37.614
Was the Army overestimating you
when it rated you five stars?

11:39.032 --> 11:42.160
Tell me about the virus
and that heavy cyborg girl.

11:42.369 --> 11:46.790
No cyber-virus was detected.
The girl's name is Emma Tsuda.

11:46.998 --> 11:51.002
Apparently she's famous on
the Net as a game app maker.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.797
Nine hours after her arrest,
that's all you've got?

11:54.005 --> 11:57.592
I guess a former Special A Rank
inspector for the Army like you

11:57.801 --> 12:00.262
gets to have lots of talented subordinates.

12:00.470 --> 12:05.350
<i>My</i> people's dedicated effort
got multiple perps captured alive.

12:05.559 --> 12:09.646
Wow, great work arresting
some mindless packaged drones.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.193
We could've stopped it if
we'd had special authority.

12:16.236 --> 12:20.157
Then stop playing gangsters and join Section 9.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.033
Unless you work directly for Home Affairs,

12:22.242 --> 12:26.037
you do get official oversight
and you don't get secrecy.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.040
Can you guarantee I'd be able to stay myself?

12:29.249 --> 12:32.878
Cutting-edge equipment can protect
cyberbrains and prosthetic bodies.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.464
And my Ghost? My beliefs?

12:35.672 --> 12:39.760
Depends on how skilled you are.
I'll even consider a budget.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.637
Create an international
counterterrorist agency for us

12:42.846 --> 12:45.307
with the same budget as the Rangers.

12:48.477 --> 12:51.229
I'm gonna go eat.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.650
Aramaki, it's been a while.

12:59.029 --> 13:02.783
Colonel Hozumi. What brings
Army intelligence here?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.287
I'll take the girl now.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.039
Care to explain?

13:10.248 --> 13:13.376
They're from a squad I trust.

13:14.461 --> 13:18.965
Ex-major Motoko Kusanagi, of the 501.

13:19.174 --> 13:22.177
Hated your master so much
you became a stray, eh?

13:22.385 --> 13:25.639
Your intel's dated. They recreated my rank.

13:27.390 --> 13:32.187
The cyber-virus used is
crucial for us to investigate.

13:32.395 --> 13:35.232
Explain why it's crucial, please.

13:35.440 --> 13:40.529
It's a triple package of brainwashing,
Ghost infiltration, and false memory creation.

13:40.737 --> 13:44.908
False memory? Last I checked,
the government doesn't admit that's possible,

13:45.116 --> 13:48.537
despite all the reports.

13:48.745 --> 13:53.291
Virus units entered this
country via a certain broker.

13:53.500 --> 13:58.547
Trust me: You won't even
manage to indict that girl.

13:58.755 --> 14:02.425
Unfortunately, she's been
transferred to Unit 501.

14:02.634 --> 14:03.468
When?

14:03.677 --> 14:07.138
The moment I agreed to
their request for cooperation.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.767
I've never thought you were clever, but this?

14:10.976 --> 14:14.646
You'll regret any foolish stubbornness.

14:22.946 --> 14:26.074
Terror by false memories...

14:26.283 --> 14:29.369
Your claims are finally proven, Major.

14:29.578 --> 14:33.498
So is the existence of a virus
that enables Ghost-hacking.

14:33.707 --> 14:37.377
Here's your next job:
Escort the girl to Unit 501.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.921
What? There was really a request?

14:40.130 --> 14:44.551
Signed by the Defense Minister.
Now give me one of your men in exchange.

14:44.759 --> 14:48.054
Did your scary ex-colleague
make you want a guard?

14:48.263 --> 14:52.017
I want information sharing.
Go renew old workplace friendships.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.810
Can I ask one thing?

14:54.019 --> 14:55.312
What is it?

14:55.520 --> 14:58.857
Assuming I did shoot her...

14:59.065 --> 15:02.861
...why didn't you use my
Ghost infiltration key to stop me?

15:05.155 --> 15:08.366
I can't answer hypothetical questions.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.118
I see.

15:11.661 --> 15:15.707
This is Dr. Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied,
the one the Major killed.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.753
She's Qhardi, but she graduated from
Kuzan Royal University as Valedictorian.

15:19.961 --> 15:24.591
A big player in Kuzan water importation
since the provisional government days.

15:24.799 --> 15:30.472
But she supported terrorism when she realized
the world would forsake her people, eh?

15:30.680 --> 15:34.225
She's smart and she's got motive,
but she's not a hacker.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.062
Someone else packaged this.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.731
What about the girl we captured?

15:41.232 --> 15:44.152
Her name's Emma Tsuda.
A 17-year-old war orphan.

15:44.361 --> 15:49.032
She makes hit cyberbrain games, which she
copyrights under the name "Tin Man."

15:49.240 --> 15:51.952
"Tin Man"... As in The <i>Wizard</i> of Oz?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.286
What's that?

15:53.495 --> 15:58.458
--In spite of everything, I still believe --Supposing
she's a teenage super-hacker, how does she fit in?

15:58.667 --> 16:01.044
--That people are really good at heart.
--Don't tell me she's the one you're after?

16:01.252 --> 16:05.048
--I wish to go on living even after my death.
--I'll know when I dive into her Ghost.

16:05.256 --> 16:08.927
lshikawa, stay on the virus and the girl.
Saito, you go to Section 9.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.304
Paz and Borma, you release the bait.

16:11.513 --> 16:14.849
Batou, Togusa, and I will escort the girl.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.810
We're starting the second round.

16:17.811 --> 16:22.857
Suggestion for you,
Miss "Hothead Who Charges In Blind."

16:23.066 --> 16:27.737
How about I become team leader
and lead us in a sensible retreat?

16:27.946 --> 16:31.157
Brave thing to say in my cyberbrain space.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.997
Step outside and let's fight!

16:37.205 --> 16:40.792
Whoa, knock it off, you guys!

17:06.276 --> 17:07.736
He's finally on the move.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.988
Thought I'd die of boredom!

17:17.579 --> 17:20.248
It might be cool if we could ride in you.

17:20.457 --> 17:24.252
The Major requested a personnel transport
shaft from the Maintenance Department!

17:24.461 --> 17:26.463
Will we pilot you from inside?

17:26.671 --> 17:31.176
Isn't that our mobile arsenal?
Where would the weapons go?

17:31.384 --> 17:36.431
We can just resupply each other.
If we armed this guy, he could be our backup.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.475
Backup, eh?

17:38.683 --> 17:41.895
Why are we using an outdated Logistics model?

17:42.103 --> 17:46.941
Ape-Face couldn't get the budget the
Major wanted, so he gave us these bots.

17:47.150 --> 17:50.779
Neurochip-type Als are hard
to hack or infect, anyway.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.323
So basically, it was us or the junkyard?

17:53.531 --> 17:59.704
What? Not good enough for the
ex-cop still wearing a necktie?

17:59.913 --> 18:05.210
My late father said looking
classy shows faith in yourself.

18:05.418 --> 18:09.005
Watching you, ex-Ranger, I see what he meant.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.633
Bold words, kid.

18:14.844 --> 18:19.015
Mr. Batou suggested modifying us
so people could ride us!

18:19.224 --> 18:23.853
I think it's a really great idea!
What do you think, Major?

18:24.062 --> 18:30.110
Don't talk nonsense. I hate machines
who pretend to have personalities.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.154
She's here.

18:46.626 --> 18:51.089
Did you hack my line to
deliberately get yourself caught?

18:51.297 --> 18:55.969
What is "Fire-Starter"?
Is it really the name of a hacker?

18:56.177 --> 19:01.641
Intelligence wants you. Military courts
don't do plea bargains, you know.

19:04.853 --> 19:07.397
I smell seawater.

19:07.605 --> 19:11.985
We aren't even allowed near the sea.

19:12.193 --> 19:17.282
Programmers are like weapons:
We're forbidden by law from moving freely.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.952
So you are the group's hacker.
What are you after?

19:21.161 --> 19:27.417
Long ago, glassblowers had no freedom,
because glasswork funded the state.

19:27.625 --> 19:32.130
If they left the country, they were blinded first.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.675
You're a refugee?
That's why you started a massacre?

19:38.136 --> 19:41.347
Do you think cyberbrains make people happy?

19:45.977 --> 19:52.066
Are your memories trustworthy?
Or were they planted by someone?

19:52.275 --> 19:58.781
When micromachine-based cyberization
came to pass, experts worldwide warned us:

19:58.990 --> 20:02.410
"False memories will be used to commit crimes."

20:02.619 --> 20:07.165
Every organization wants
that technology. My technology.

20:07.373 --> 20:11.252
You mean you successfully
made memory-manipulation tech?

20:11.461 --> 20:14.797
Your memories might even be...

20:16.591 --> 20:19.344
I'm diving right here, right now!

20:19.552 --> 20:21.346
Saw that coming.

20:21.554 --> 20:26.351
We don't know what this virus is.
What if you get infected?

20:26.559 --> 20:29.062
I'll blow it away, and her cyberbrain with it.

20:29.270 --> 20:34.692
A hacker who commits mass murder
just to escape deserves assassination.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.361
During your dive?!

20:36.569 --> 20:39.072
Your cyber warfare style is twisted.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.116
I prefer the term "super-wizard-class."

20:42.325 --> 20:47.705
"Wizard"... Magician.
Magician who can't go home...

20:47.914 --> 20:49.916
I'm diving straight in through her line.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.877
Uh-huh, ignore protocol.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.963
Hey, somethings weird.

20:58.091 --> 21:02.053
You're being hacked!
They're doing it through her cyberbrain!

21:02.262 --> 21:05.473
What's going on? This isn't just backfire!

21:05.682 --> 21:09.269
Emma... Danger... Emma...

21:14.440 --> 21:15.942
You...

21:24.826 --> 21:26.327
Major!

21:30.415 --> 21:34.002
I'm sorry, Emma... I'm sorry.

21:34.210 --> 21:37.880
It's okay. I wanted this.

21:38.089 --> 21:40.174
Don't cry, Brinda.

21:42.093 --> 21:45.096
There are two Ghosts in there?

21:55.023 --> 21:58.234
I heard about Section 9's meddling.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.696
You couldn't have shot her before
she started blabbing about asylum?

22:01.904 --> 22:06.117
That shooting is currently under
investigation, Deputy Director Amagata.

22:06.326 --> 22:10.997
I can imagine the profound
effects this incident will have

22:11.205 --> 22:15.668
on the Next-Generation Weapons
Review Committee you serve on.

22:15.877 --> 22:18.463
The year-end industry fair has been cancelled.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.131
And thanks to pressure from
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

22:20.340 --> 22:23.634
we won't be unveiling our
prototype weapons, either.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.804
It's shaking the foundations of the company.

22:27.013 --> 22:31.893
I hear you're pressing for large-scale
water sales even after Dr. Thied's death.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.562
I have a duty to fulfill my contract.

22:34.771 --> 22:39.317
And effective use of resources is
key for an international company.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.987
There are some out there who
can't even secure drinking water.

22:43.196 --> 22:46.866
If you just want to criticize my economics,
I'm going back to work.

22:54.624 --> 22:57.794
You're not cut out for government work.

22:58.002 --> 23:01.798
Start an NPO and go live
in some refugee camp.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.262
He's annoying.

23:08.471 --> 23:12.642
He's a classic ex-politician, and he owes
me one from my intelligence days.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.603
Which means he's a reliable source.

23:17.230 --> 23:20.775
NPOs, camps... and Foreign Affairs?

23:20.983 --> 23:23.778
The council on weapons development!

23:23.986 --> 23:27.407
Was that the objective behind the
cyberterrorism against Harimadara?

23:27.615 --> 23:29.158
Lately there's a debate about
whether next-gen weapons

23:29.367 --> 23:33.287
should be produced domestically
or developed abroad.

23:33.496 --> 23:38.543
The overseas faction'd be thrilled if
a domestic manufacturer got attacked.

23:38.751 --> 23:42.797
Here we go: an NPO that
"treats cyberization disorders."

23:43.005 --> 23:45.383
They disseminated cyberization
and learning devices

23:45.591 --> 23:48.553
in refugee camps in Kuzan during the war.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.221
And domestically?

23:50.430 --> 23:54.642
Got a hit on that girl in the
same NPO's treatment records.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.936
Cyberization rejection syndrome.

23:57.145 --> 23:58.646
Apparently she ran away

23:58.855 --> 24:01.482
from a war orphan facility because
she rejected being cyberized.

24:01.691 --> 24:04.694
Not wanting a cyberbrain means you're sick?

24:04.902 --> 24:08.114
The white paper on cyberization
the MHLW released after the war

24:08.322 --> 24:10.366
classifies it with anorexia.

24:10.575 --> 24:13.077
That's news to me.

24:13.286 --> 24:16.706
The cyberization business
is insanely big money.

24:16.914 --> 24:21.919
Pretty predictable that people who
don't want it get treated as sick.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.089
Could she be a genuine multiple personality?

24:25.298 --> 24:30.052
The prevailing theory is that
personalities split but Ghosts don't.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.096
The issue is, what did that NPO

24:32.305 --> 24:36.559
have to do with a business deal
motivated by military development?

24:36.767 --> 24:41.022
Go at the military-industrial complex
from both ends: soldiers and companies.

24:52.074 --> 24:55.077
It's me. The others got caught.

24:58.915 --> 25:02.710
Don't worry, you'll see them in the afterlife.

25:07.507 --> 25:08.841
Hello!

25:09.050 --> 25:10.760
Y-You a cop?

25:15.097 --> 25:19.101
I-I prepared a confession.
Let me call my lawyer--

25:20.353 --> 25:23.231
You're not getting that chance.

25:23.439 --> 25:28.569
You killed our bait, so you're
gonna tell us everything.

25:34.909 --> 25:37.370
Started to miss your old home?

25:39.580 --> 25:43.084
I'm only here to bring in
your witness, Lt. Col. Kurutsu.

25:43.292 --> 25:47.421
Tsumugi is standing by. Dive if you want to.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.882
Assuming she has a Ghost, that is.

25:50.091 --> 25:51.801
What do you mean?

25:52.009 --> 25:53.553
I'm stepping out.

25:53.761 --> 25:57.848
As a member of the committee, I need to
be at Harimadara's product inspection.

25:58.057 --> 26:01.185
Still obsessed with getting promoted?

26:01.394 --> 26:04.021
It's something you ran away without doing.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.591
Nice to see you, Kusanagi.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.552
I didn't think we'd have another
chance to work with you.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.470
Are these your men?

26:36.679 --> 26:39.098
Yes. Batou and Togusa.

26:39.307 --> 26:43.686
This is Tsumugi Dokuro.
They're both cyber warfare tactical officers.

26:43.894 --> 26:47.648
"Both"? Are they sharing a body?

26:47.857 --> 26:51.027
She says they're two identical
twins in one conjoined body.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.988
I dunno how they move.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.407
The world's full of surprises.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.454
Let's get started.

27:10.254 --> 27:12.465
So, only the body came back.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.050
What do you mean?

27:14.258 --> 27:17.637
She's a technical officer in
Lt. Col. Kurutsu's command.

27:17.845 --> 27:22.850
She was investigating a hacker with
a special neurochip-type cyberbrain.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.644
He's known as "Scarecrow,"

27:24.852 --> 27:28.022
and he's a suspect in the
terrorist attack on Harimadara.

27:28.230 --> 27:31.150
Another <i>Oz</i> character?

27:31.359 --> 27:32.401
Huh?

27:32.610 --> 27:37.907
Our conclusion is that he's a
special spy based on postwar tech.

27:38.115 --> 27:40.618
Emma was the one who reasoned it out.

27:40.826 --> 27:44.246
She hypothesized a hacker
with the same disorder she had.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.624
Someone who had to incrementally
replace his brain with neurochips

27:46.832 --> 27:49.210
and prosthetize his body to survive.

27:49.418 --> 27:52.004
She had that disorder?

27:52.213 --> 27:56.342
Personality attenuates, and self hood can't
be retained without auxiliary cyberbrains.

27:56.550 --> 28:02.014
Emma transformed her impairment into
her signature trait, as did Scarecrow.

28:02.223 --> 28:05.393
Emma regularly used advanced
cyberization to structure her self hood,

28:05.601 --> 28:07.436
but Scarecrow is different.

28:07.645 --> 28:10.690
To compensate for his attenuated personality,
he dubs the Ghosts of others,

28:10.898 --> 28:13.484
steals their bodies,
and assumes their identities.

28:13.693 --> 28:17.279
Like the scarecrow who can't think
inserting a false brain into his head.

28:17.488 --> 28:18.989
Seriously?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.200
In other words, this is...

28:21.409 --> 28:25.996
The body is Emma's, but it's
being operated by a man's brain

28:26.205 --> 28:30.167
which is only one-third the normal size
and cyberized with neurochips.

28:30.376 --> 28:35.047
So what I dived into was
the girl's dubbed Ghost.

28:35.256 --> 28:37.299
What happened to her brain?

28:37.508 --> 28:39.343
Ghost Dubbing would've degraded it.

28:39.552 --> 28:42.972
It's either in the trash or
sliced up in his research lab.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.682
That's awful...

28:45.725 --> 28:48.894
Poor Emma. I'm sorry.

28:49.103 --> 28:51.856
It's okay, Junior. Don't be afraid.

28:52.064 --> 28:55.735
I know the lions will come.
The people with courage...

28:55.943 --> 28:59.238
Who are you? Tell me who you work for.

28:59.447 --> 29:03.117
I am a scarecrow. My brain is fading away.

29:03.325 --> 29:06.203
I am tin. My heart is fading away.

29:06.412 --> 29:11.125
Is that Emma talking, or her dubbed Ghost?

29:11.333 --> 29:14.587
Tin Girl, give me the scarecrow man's name.

29:16.756 --> 29:22.094
His name is Brinda Jr. Please, don't blame him.

29:24.388 --> 29:29.059
Got a hit at a postwar nursing home!
And the same NPO is involved with it.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.187
Brinda Jr., age 32.

29:31.395 --> 29:34.482
After he was cyberized, he became an
accountant at an employment agency.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.983
His personality's thin,

29:36.192 --> 29:39.862
but he memorized a 200-digit number
in two seconds for an IQ test.

29:40.070 --> 29:42.740
That's textbook for someone
with special cognitive abilities.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.826
Find out which organization
set him up as a hacker.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.328
Roger.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.873
I'm diving into that man's Ghost.

29:51.081 --> 29:54.293
There are only a handful of proven
double Ghosts in existence.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.754
We don't know the dangers.

29:56.962 --> 30:00.049
I want to know which Ghost has motive.

30:00.257 --> 30:03.093
You're doubting Emma? She's the victim here.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.845
Then I'll confirm that.

30:05.054 --> 30:08.557
Batou, be my backup in case they back-hack me.

30:08.766 --> 30:11.852
Two against two, eh?

30:15.981 --> 30:18.818
Togusa. Get all the records copied.

30:19.026 --> 30:23.614
Roger. Oh, here...
Sorry, it's a call from my dad.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.910
Hey Dad, it's been a while. Yeah.

30:28.118 --> 30:30.746
Batou! Restrain Togusa!

30:30.955 --> 30:33.958
Got it. I'll become the Lion.

30:39.213 --> 30:41.090
A Mateba, still?

30:42.550 --> 30:44.051
Don't move!

30:56.355 --> 30:57.481
Major!

30:57.690 --> 30:59.191
Let's go.

31:01.443 --> 31:06.907
This is crazy! I found a Starter
log on his comm-it's the virus!

31:07.116 --> 31:10.828
He must have kept the virus
inactive within his neurochips.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.997
His infiltration was unexpectedly quick.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.834
So, it combines victims' memories of past
hostility with objects in front of them

31:17.042 --> 31:20.045
to plant instantaneous false memories?

31:50.075 --> 31:51.827
I can get deadly, right?

31:52.036 --> 31:54.496
That was your last breath if you don't.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.292
Don't underestimate me!

32:02.046 --> 32:05.799
The scarecrow is the virus's host and
Togusa's brain is the package, right?

32:06.008 --> 32:09.219
Yep. But the infection route's
disturbingly selective.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.097
Only people around you are being infected.

32:13.807 --> 32:16.769
Does that mean the onset can be regulated?

32:16.977 --> 32:20.314
That'd be impossible without
a third party to switch it on.

32:20.522 --> 32:24.610
Which I guess means it's a virus
whose damage can be controlled.

32:24.818 --> 32:28.614
Then it's military.
Reanalyze yesterday's infection data.

32:28.822 --> 32:32.493
We don't want to chase the virus; we want
to chase the enemy in possession of it.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.955
I wish to go on living even after my death.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.289
Hidden data?

32:37.498 --> 32:44.296
For these 620 reasons, we oppose
cyberization without free choice.

32:44.505 --> 32:47.758
Reason: We submit that
software within the cyberbrain

32:47.967 --> 32:52.972
is vulnerable to third-party tampering.

32:53.180 --> 32:57.977
Reason: Electronic alteration
of memory causes abnormalities

32:58.185 --> 33:03.315
in the totality of our independent
will referred to as the "Ghost."

33:03.524 --> 33:08.570
Do you actually think a world without
infection and infiltration is possible?!

33:11.198 --> 33:12.992
Tsumugi! You alive?

33:13.200 --> 33:16.161
I'm running a sim of the
scarecrow's brain. Help me.

33:16.370 --> 33:20.040
You have Emma Tsuda's Ghost infiltration key,
don't you? Make me a backdoor.

33:20.249 --> 33:23.711
I see, you're going to use
Scarecrow's cyberbrain structure

33:23.919 --> 33:26.171
to approximate a vaccine?

33:38.684 --> 33:44.815
Reason: There are currently seventeen
possible ways to alter our memories.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.483
Shit!

33:46.692 --> 33:50.946
Major! Why won't you use my
Ghost infiltration key to stop this?!

33:51.155 --> 33:54.575
It's no use. Brinda won't let her.

33:54.783 --> 33:59.621
I will become anyone. I've inputted
and erased many Ghosts.

33:59.830 --> 34:03.417
I disappeared, too... Who am I?

34:03.625 --> 34:09.214
Was Unit 501 a target, too?
Aren't you a victim after all?!

34:09.422 --> 34:11.550
There was no other way.

34:11.759 --> 34:13.719
What are you after?

34:28.358 --> 34:30.527
Don't disappear, Emma.

34:34.197 --> 34:38.077
Let's go on living after our deaths, together.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.748
They're here.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.340
An attack barrier!

34:53.132 --> 34:54.967
Major!

34:55.177 --> 34:56.344
Colonel!

34:56.553 --> 35:01.266
They fought each other with attack barriers.
One of them got forwarded.

35:01.475 --> 35:03.894
I can't believe it was stronger than ours...

35:04.103 --> 35:06.563
You were infiltrated for a moment.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.983
Delete all relevant operational
headquarters from the cyberbrain Net.

35:10.192 --> 35:13.153
Go after Brinda. There's nothing left to do here.

35:17.199 --> 35:18.951
Damn stray dog...

35:27.042 --> 35:29.002
Looks like we pulled it off.

35:29.211 --> 35:31.797
The host and Starter are still active.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.482
We can see the ocean, Emma.

35:51.942 --> 35:54.695
This creeps even me out, Major.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.029
Report.

35:56.238 --> 36:00.534
Col. Hozumi from Army intelligence
was the one to recruit Brinda Jr.

36:00.742 --> 36:04.121
"Scarecrow" is an op cooked up
by their old Investigations Section

36:04.329 --> 36:07.666
during a period when they were
working on Ghost Dub devices.

36:07.875 --> 36:13.213
Hozumi got on the Next-Gen Weapons
Review Committee through Foreign Affairs.

36:13.422 --> 36:18.302
But she wasn't there long,
and Kurutsu of Unit 501 took her seat

36:18.510 --> 36:21.889
at Vice-Minister Kitahara's recommendation.

36:22.097 --> 36:26.768
Unit 501 got a hold on Hozumi
through military musical chairs, eh?

36:26.977 --> 36:30.397
Reason: We can prove
that false memories

36:30.606 --> 36:34.776
compel us to commit murder, suicide,

36:34.985 --> 36:38.739
--and other criminal acts.
--Which one built the pod?

36:38.947 --> 36:45.078
Unknown. But Army intelligence decided to
rally by interfering with the Review Committee.

36:45.287 --> 36:48.790
I'd guess that somewhere in there,
the two hackers became aware of each other.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.835
The attack on Harimadara is the connection?

36:52.044 --> 36:54.796
There's no evidence they did it.

36:55.005 --> 36:58.425
But Hozumi is in the overseas
weapons development faction,

36:58.634 --> 37:00.969
and Harimadara's a domestic faction stronghold.

37:01.178 --> 37:03.055
Who shot our bait?

37:03.263 --> 37:09.561
A Kuzan water cartel hit man.
Hozumi's playing with serious fire.

37:09.770 --> 37:11.855
She used the pretext of wartime industry

37:12.064 --> 37:15.651
to interfere in Kuzan's affairs while
she was stationed there during the war.

37:15.859 --> 37:19.988
If she can't subdue the domestic faction
and give the cartel the profits she promised,

37:20.197 --> 37:22.532
it'll retaliate against her.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.326
Starter analysis results?

37:24.534 --> 37:26.870
Couldn't pin down the trigger,
but I got my answer

37:27.079 --> 37:29.957
from the fact that we couldn't find
the infection route into the building

37:30.165 --> 37:34.670
even though Section <i>9</i> had domination over it.

37:34.878 --> 37:37.214
It was a C4ISR network.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.675
A military communications system.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.593
Things are starting to come clear.

37:41.802 --> 37:43.637
Col. Hozumi's the one
who activated Starter

37:43.845 --> 37:48.475
and patched the virus through
to infect the VIP room's security.

37:48.684 --> 37:50.811
She was after the woman the guard shot.

37:51.019 --> 37:54.398
Senior Vice-Minister Kitahara,
who's with the domestic faction.

37:54.606 --> 37:57.526
That massacre was a
smokescreen for one murder?!

37:57.734 --> 37:59.611
Guess she's a born war-lover.

37:59.820 --> 38:02.197
Why snipe Tin Girl?

38:02.406 --> 38:03.198
That was a bluff.

38:03.407 --> 38:08.161
She must've wanted to get rid of us
and get Tin Girl safely to the 501.

38:08.370 --> 38:11.415
So her little visit to Section <i>9</i>
was a smokescreen, too?

38:11.623 --> 38:15.836
She backed down so easily because
she was after Unit 501 from the start.

38:16.044 --> 38:20.757
So she could set up anti-cyberbrainist
Emma Tsuda as the massacre's ringleader.

38:20.966 --> 38:27.097
Harimadara, the Vice-Minister, the 501
She had a threefold plan to take them all out!

38:27.306 --> 38:29.266
What about the Ghost of
the girl who got dubbed?

38:29.474 --> 38:34.354
If she does have her own will,
Why'd she knowingly let Hozumi use her?

38:34.563 --> 38:39.359
Just from the circumstances, the scarecrow
is the one you've been after.

38:39.568 --> 38:44.281
He didn't necessarily write the virus.
Hozumi said there was a broker.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.826
If she told the truth,
someone out there made and sold it.

38:48.035 --> 38:49.453
That's who I'm after.

38:49.661 --> 38:55.751
This is all speculation. Right now,
there's only one way for us to get proof.

38:55.959 --> 38:59.087
I assume you have Togusa's location.
We'll meet en route.

38:59.296 --> 39:03.300
We're going to capture both Ghosts--
the scarecrow's, and the girl's.

39:04.301 --> 39:05.802
Togusa's the problem.

39:06.011 --> 39:10.015
Blowing a married teammate's
brains out ain't my job.

39:10.223 --> 39:13.310
We know for sure this infection
plants false memories, right?

39:13.518 --> 39:16.897
You saw him talking to his dead father.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.732
There should be a shared form.

39:18.940 --> 39:23.278
I'll get infected, so you ID it and
version up your makeshift vaccine.

39:23.487 --> 39:25.238
You want to mirror your own brain?

39:25.447 --> 39:28.492
Worst case scenario, blow my brains out.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.410
So that's my job?

39:30.619 --> 39:33.955
If you don't like it, make me the leader.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.749
A checkpoint?

39:37.250 --> 39:39.795
You're on the wanted list
as a suspected terrorist!

39:40.003 --> 39:43.465
Shit, it's Section 9! The ape
used to be in Army intelligence.

39:43.673 --> 39:46.510
He cut a deal with Hozumi, and he's framing us!

39:46.718 --> 39:51.431
She may just want us to think so.
I'll send Section <i>9</i> our intel.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.017
After all this, you're still relying on him?!

39:54.226 --> 39:56.853
--No.
--Why, then?!

39:57.062 --> 40:00.315
My Ghost is whispering that I should do it.

40:16.373 --> 40:19.251
Wait! Where are you going?!

40:20.627 --> 40:22.129
Stop!

40:23.505 --> 40:26.425
We promised we'd go far away.

40:32.848 --> 40:34.349
Goodbye.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.789
I released the package!

40:59.416 --> 41:01.209
I'm going on ahead.

41:01.418 --> 41:05.589
I told you to shoot if things went south!
Take a damn gun with you...

41:07.841 --> 41:09.342
Major...

41:12.637 --> 41:14.264
She's in pieces!

41:14.473 --> 41:16.808
If she's a neurochip version, she's still alive.

41:20.103 --> 41:22.314
We'll go on living.

41:31.490 --> 41:34.910
It's a Ghost Dub, not a transfer?!

41:44.669 --> 41:46.880
That's a Harimadara prototype!

41:49.758 --> 41:50.800
Major!

41:51.009 --> 41:53.762
Two Ghosts have been dubbed into that thing.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.515
We're going to stop it! Logicomas,
give me everything you've got!

41:56.723 --> 41:58.517
Yes, sir!

42:01.311 --> 42:05.023
Where the hell would they
abandon their own lives to go?

42:06.316 --> 42:07.442
The ocean.

42:07.651 --> 42:08.652
Huh?

42:08.860 --> 42:12.239
They're not going anywhere! This ends here!

42:57.867 --> 43:00.996
Next-gen weapon or not, its brains are rookies.

43:01.204 --> 43:03.665
Aim for the eyes and legs,
and it's a piece of cake.

43:17.137 --> 43:18.680
For real?!

44:07.979 --> 44:09.648
Got you now!

44:20.950 --> 44:21.826
What's that?

44:22.035 --> 44:25.330
It's Army intelligence! The bastards
requested an artillery strike!

44:32.337 --> 44:35.090
You've cut off your sensory system?!

44:35.298 --> 44:36.800
Crap!

44:45.433 --> 44:47.727
You discarded intensity regions...

44:47.936 --> 44:52.941
Recognition systems, memory fields,
the Net that maintains your architecture...

45:13.712 --> 45:16.089
You even jettisoned your own Ghost!

45:16.297 --> 45:19.801
You want a life you've
stripped all meaning from?!

46:34.709 --> 46:36.211
Goodbye.

47:04.697 --> 47:06.032
It's over.

47:06.241 --> 47:09.994
Return to base. We're going
to Kuzan, by way of Benares.

47:12.455 --> 47:15.583
The world's cyber economy has only just begun.

47:15.792 --> 47:18.503
I'll pay whatever it takes
to reconcile with the cartel--

47:31.057 --> 47:32.976
On your knees, hands in the air!

47:34.477 --> 47:37.981
Oh, the wanted poster. Told you so.

47:45.572 --> 47:47.657
You're just like that Section <i>9</i> chief.

47:47.866 --> 47:52.412
Never happy unless you're
digging up what's dead and buried.

47:52.620 --> 47:55.415
It's something you ran away without doing.

47:57.500 --> 48:01.296
Nothing's going to change, Kusanagi.

48:01.504 --> 48:04.507
We're an independent offensive unit.

48:04.716 --> 48:06.175
We stand independent of the system,

48:06.384 --> 48:10.972
and we have truly discrete
personalities that don't get packaged.

48:11.180 --> 48:14.225
When we're officially approved
as top priority, we'll root out

48:14.434 --> 48:18.605
all the sorry bastards who conspire
because they're afraid of a scandal.

48:21.274 --> 48:23.818
And you count me as one of them?

48:25.361 --> 48:32.035
I never changed your channel. Contact me
whenever you want to come home.

48:44.631 --> 48:49.218
You're free to go. We voided the
wanted notice Col. Hozumi put out.

48:49.427 --> 48:53.389
Vice-Minister of Defense Kitahara
wants to thank you.

48:53.598 --> 48:55.808
Is that some sort of joke?

48:56.017 --> 48:58.144
A political one.

48:58.353 --> 49:01.522
Section <i>9</i> just went through
Col. Hozumi's possessions

49:01.731 --> 49:06.069
and confiscated a Ghost Dub device
and an outline of the Scarecrow op.

49:06.277 --> 49:08.237
They couldn't arrest her, though.

49:08.446 --> 49:11.032
No--but then she confessed.

49:15.161 --> 49:19.958
Her chopper was shot down
with Kuzan weapons.

49:20.166 --> 49:22.335
She's afraid enough of the cartel's revenge

49:22.543 --> 49:25.713
to request protective
custody and a plea bargain.

49:25.922 --> 49:27.548
So she'll get off scat-free.

49:27.757 --> 49:29.175
I'll make sure she doesn't.

49:29.384 --> 49:34.138
The NPO she worked with is a front
for dirty cyberbrain business.

49:34.347 --> 49:39.894
Not only that, we've detected Starter
in her cyberbrain, just like your intel said.

49:40.103 --> 49:43.523
She got a lot of people injured or killed,
and I'll make her pay for that--

49:43.731 --> 49:47.276
even if I can't take her to court yet.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.570
Where did she get the virus?

49:49.779 --> 49:55.118
Through a broker, she says. She claims
to know nothing about its author.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.161
I see.

49:57.370 --> 50:00.581
Was it really the cartel
who tried to kill Hozumi?

50:00.790 --> 50:04.669
Even if it was someone who wanted
to prevent us from investigating her,

50:04.877 --> 50:07.213
I'm sure any trace of them is long gone.

50:20.393 --> 50:21.561
Major.

50:21.769 --> 50:26.983
All of you came? I didn't know
I had such admirable subordinates.

50:27.191 --> 50:30.528
You could've been attacked while in custody.

50:30.737 --> 50:33.948
We've been keeping an eye on all
the suspicious characters who came by.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.827
One more thing. I told the
Minister of Home Affairs

50:38.036 --> 50:41.873
that your team contributed
to deterring the virus.

50:42.081 --> 50:47.253
Use your vaunted cyberbrain to read
Public Security Commission report N2077.

50:47.462 --> 50:50.840
As of tomorrow, you get special authority.

50:51.049 --> 50:53.384
<i>Without official oversight.</i>

50:53.593 --> 50:55.928
This case isn't over.

50:56.137 --> 51:00.516
Investigate the high-level hacking
virus and any organizations involved,

51:00.725 --> 51:03.352
and plan to attend plenty
of funerals along the way.

51:03.561 --> 51:05.855
I shot Thied.

51:06.064 --> 51:08.816
You must have had a hunch that an
intelligence bigwig was behind this,

51:09.025 --> 51:12.153
meaning you would've wanted
an intel advantage at any cost.

51:12.361 --> 51:15.073
So why didn't you stop me?!

51:15.281 --> 51:18.910
Because I don't have
your Ghost infiltration key.

51:21.537 --> 51:25.333
No organization will ever have it.

51:25.541 --> 51:29.420
I promised your late commander that.

51:53.653 --> 51:56.614
Bottom line, all we figured out
was that someone out there

51:56.823 --> 52:03.830
used a couple of anti-cyberbrainist hackers
and a miserable water company chick.

52:04.038 --> 52:06.999
We may be looking for a crime
worth sacrificing lives over,

52:07.208 --> 52:09.418
but all we have are money-mad war profiteers

52:09.627 --> 52:12.547
and a man and girl obsessed
with casting things away.

52:12.755 --> 52:14.382
For now, that is.

52:15.883 --> 52:23.683
Which one had agency, the man or the girl?
Did they even have real will?

52:25.143 --> 52:28.896
When they blocked my infiltration, at least.

52:29.105 --> 52:35.528
But they fled with nowhere to go,
then had to transfer into that weapon.

52:35.736 --> 52:40.408
That think-tank's cyberbrain
had a massive output system.

52:40.616 --> 52:41.951
Hmm?

52:42.160 --> 52:45.121
What if the reason they cast away
what made them themselves

52:45.329 --> 52:49.500
was to output the last thing left into the Net?

52:49.709 --> 52:52.044
You think that's where they were going?

52:52.253 --> 52:57.175
Pouring the last shreds of their Ghosts
into the Net... Is that even possible?

52:58.301 --> 53:01.804
It's been researched,
but it's impossible to prove.

53:04.348 --> 53:08.853
But in the moment their Ghosts were lost,
I got the feeling they'd fused.

53:09.061 --> 53:11.564
That two lives had become one...

53:11.772 --> 53:17.111
That isn't like you. Ghosts are the
most independent things in this world.

53:17.320 --> 53:21.282
Even the ones being controlled are
fundamentally, eternally standalone.

53:21.490 --> 53:23.701
Like our squad, yeah?

53:26.954 --> 53:28.623
Yeah.

53:28.831 --> 53:33.461
Well? The floaters are all ready.
I got a set of two.

53:33.669 --> 53:36.422
Even someone with a
titanium skull wouldn't drown.

53:36.631 --> 53:39.467
You seriously want to swim
in the ocean in midwinter?

53:39.675 --> 53:42.595
Gotta shake off those
memories of almost drowning.

53:42.803 --> 53:45.640
Plus it ain't too often I get
to see you in a swimsuit.

53:45.848 --> 53:47.016
That's your real goal?

53:47.225 --> 53:48.893
--Huh?
--Unbelievable.

53:49.101 --> 53:52.438
No, no! I'm doing this all for you!

53:54.732 --> 53:56.484
I'll take a rain check.

53:56.692 --> 53:59.278
I'm telling you, you got it all wrong!

54:30.601 --> 54:37.066
<i>Wavering sorrow and hatred</i>

54:37.275 --> 54:42.571
<i>It all dims over time</i>

54:42.780 --> 54:47.493

54:47.702 --> 54:51.872

54:54.083 --> 54:56.711
<i>Away</i>

54:56.919 --> 55:03.592
<i>Broken-off memory freezes in the sky</i>

55:03.801 --> 55:08.973
<i>This heart rent asunder</i>

55:09.181 --> 55:13.978

55:14.186 --> 55:18.232

55:20.693 --> 55:22.236
<i>Nowhere</i>

55:22.445 --> 55:27.199
<i>We split in two (slipping)</i>

55:27.408 --> 55:31.495
<i>We're slipping, we're slipping away</i>

56:13.579 --> 56:15.289
<i>Away</i>

56:15.498 --> 56:20.252
<i>Vanishing (slipping)</i>

56:20.461 --> 56:24.632
<i>We're going, we're going insane</i>
