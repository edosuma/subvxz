04:23.785 --> 04:25.308
American?
Do you speak English?

04:25.352 --> 04:26.875
No. [French language].

04:26.918 --> 04:28.050
Oh.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.057
Just these.
Oui.

04:38.974 --> 04:41.019
Thank-- Merci beaucoup.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.065
[French language].

04:47.243 --> 04:49.811
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

04:51.378 --> 04:52.553
Oh, damn it.

04:52.596 --> 04:53.728
You dropped your book.

04:53.771 --> 04:55.164
Oh, you speak English.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.166
Yes, of course. Doesn't
everyone?

04:57.209 --> 04:59.864
I feel like I'm in grade school
trying to find a seat at the
lunch table.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.213
You can sit with me if you like.

05:01.257 --> 05:02.345
Thanks.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.217
I haven't had anything to eat
all day.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.830
So are you backpacking through
Europe?

05:08.873 --> 05:10.614
Is that a really cliché thing to
do?

05:10.658 --> 05:12.921
No. It's a great way to see
Europe.

05:13.182 --> 05:14.531
See France.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.316
I still can't believe that I'm
here.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.840
Paris? It's so beautiful.

05:19.144 --> 05:21.843
Let me guess, you're an artist?

05:22.409 --> 05:23.714
Not so much.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.412
A story in the back you could
say.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.936
Welcome to the club.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.939
Any reason why you chose art?

05:30.982 --> 05:33.333
You could say
it was my father's influence.

05:34.508 --> 05:35.900
Was he an artist?

05:35.944 --> 05:39.426
No. He's the CEO
of a major pharmaceutical
company

05:39.469 --> 05:41.297
and a professional asshole.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.953
I only chose art
because I knew who wouldn't
approve.

05:45.649 --> 05:49.479
It was a good excuse
to go to the US for a few years
and study.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.526
What about you?

05:52.569 --> 05:55.093
My dad taught art history at
Penn State.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.445
I would sit in on classes
from time to time.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.229
I got the bug from him.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.449
So we are both inspired by our
fathers,

06:03.058 --> 06:05.452
but in very different ways.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.890
When he passed away last year,
I almost gave up.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.720
It took some time to get over
that
but eventually I found my way
again.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.199
Your mother?

06:15.244 --> 06:17.768
I don't remember much of her,
only glimpses,

06:17.812 --> 06:19.422
like hazy photographs.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.468
She died when I was two of
cancer,

06:22.338 --> 06:24.514
but I wish I had more time with
her as a child.

06:26.516 --> 06:28.562
Astrid, we need your opinion
on something.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.912
If it's how big your--

06:30.955 --> 06:33.001
No, nothing like that.

06:33.305 --> 06:35.395
Who do you think would win in a
fight?

06:36.439 --> 06:39.529
Well, you of course.
Pierre wouldn't stand a chance.

06:40.095 --> 06:44.142
I don't, like a descendant
of Marco Sekunden would lose to
anyone.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.755
The French great one,
champion of the world 1948.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.105
'48, I know.
You speak about him all the
time.

06:50.148 --> 06:53.325
The fighting genes skip certain
generation,
yours is one of them.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.855
I see,
who's your pretty friend?

07:00.898 --> 07:02.813
Oh, where are my manners?

07:03.553 --> 07:04.772
Vivi.

07:04.815 --> 07:06.861
Heather, it's nice to meet you.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.471
Nice to meet you.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.169
Time for a latte?
Yes, my latte. Latte, latte,
latte.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.870
Sorry, Heather.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.263
So, American?

07:19.569 --> 07:21.049
I love Americans.

07:21.092 --> 07:23.747
You're more fun
than these European girls.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.621
I'm sure Heather has no interest
in you, Pierre.

07:27.664 --> 07:31.668
Most women find me extremely
charming.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.496
Most?

07:35.367 --> 07:36.673
Go get your own.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.632
Ooooh.

07:38.675 --> 07:39.894
I'll be back.

07:41.069 --> 07:44.638
What brings you to Paris?

07:44.681 --> 07:45.943
A vacation?

07:46.596 --> 07:48.206
You could say that.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.993
You should come out with us
tonight.
We'll show you the real Paris.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.822
It'll be fun.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.477
You should.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.002
Maybe some other time.
I'm still adjusting from the
jet lag.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.134
I will keep you safe. I promise.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.615
Who will keep her safe from you,
Pierre?

08:06.834 --> 08:08.488
I really should get some rest.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.577
Oh, come on.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.405
Did you fly all the way down
here
to rest and stay locked up in
the room?

08:13.449 --> 08:16.278
Or did you come over
to see something new?

08:17.279 --> 08:19.324
Sometimes you just have to say
yes.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.502
It's going to be fun. Say yes.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.331
Okay. I'm in. Let's do it.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.724
Yes.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.073
I'm in.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.640
Yes.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.337
To Paris.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.251
Welcome to Paris.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.863
Thank you.

08:36.515 --> 08:44.219
[music]

08:44.261 --> 08:46.917
Get everything finished
and call me when you're done.

08:49.616 --> 08:50.747
[knock]

08:50.791 --> 08:51.966
Come in.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.492
How are you?

08:58.015 --> 08:59.190
Surprised.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.410
Sit down.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.197
Have you been sleeping?

09:08.330 --> 09:10.550
No, still not sleeping well.

09:10.811 --> 09:14.510
I'm sure you didn't call me in
here
to ask me about my sleep.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.252
Taking your medication?

09:17.992 --> 09:20.255
Still not sleeping well,
even with the pills.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.736
Elizabeth, what is this about?

09:24.738 --> 09:26.043
They want you gone.

09:27.654 --> 09:28.872
Who?

09:30.874 --> 09:33.573
Look, you've done an exceptional
job
and you still do an exceptional
job,

09:34.530 --> 09:36.401
except times have changed

09:37.751 --> 09:39.013
and so have you.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.585
I'm doing an exceptional job
and they want me gone.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.587
Who, Elizabeth?

09:49.501 --> 09:51.808
Those politicians who only care
about themselves and their
positions

09:53.680 --> 09:55.029
or the committee?

09:55.725 --> 09:57.248
I am the committee.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.859
I know

09:59.207 --> 10:01.078
and that's why I'm saying this
to you.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.995
In the past when you were a cop,
you wouldn't talk like this.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.042
Let's go get some coffee.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.482
Can't believe they bugged your
office.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.223
The tides have changed.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.138
They don't want a scandal.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.838
The power between countries
has gotten really, really
difficult.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.014
I just capture terrorists.

10:24.493 --> 10:29.063
You capture terrorists,
but worse, you want revenge.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.587
I do my job, Elizabeth.

10:32.283 --> 10:36.157
Look, we've been friends for so
many years
and there's times that I turn
my face

10:36.200 --> 10:37.724
and I look the other way.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.857
You know why?
Because I know that you're
good,

10:41.684 --> 10:43.991
but there's nothing I can do
right now.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.297
So, I'm out?

10:46.689 --> 10:50.040
They want to restructure things.
They're scared.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.260
There's new terrorists now.

10:52.303 --> 10:55.437
They don't care
about the bombing in 2005 in
London.

10:55.872 --> 10:58.179
They care about the terrorist
right now.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.661
What about Al Sawari and Abdel
Fariq?

11:02.226 --> 11:04.751
They're the past. They have no
power.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.492
Nobody's interested but you.

11:08.319 --> 11:11.583
Oh, so you're saying the only
reason
why I have any interest in them

11:11.627 --> 11:13.455
is because they killed my son,
right?

11:13.498 --> 11:16.023
A lot of people died in London,
Elizabeth.

11:17.198 --> 11:20.070
They still have an active terror
cell there.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.506
I know it.

11:22.638 --> 11:25.554
Oh, come on.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.339
What did they promise you, huh?

11:28.383 --> 11:30.907
What did they promise you
to get me out of here?

11:31.386 --> 11:33.823
They want your resignation on my
desk
by Friday.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.129
Elizabeth.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.131
Elizabeth, listen to me.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.873
I'm close.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.703
Just give me a little more time.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.705
There's nothing I can do.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.619
It's politics.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.404
There's elections.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.406
You don't even like politics.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.975
Just move on and live.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.065
You know I can't live like that.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.502
Well, you're going to have to
learn.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.461
I did.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.594
Yes.

12:08.162 --> 12:09.598
I could see that.

12:09.641 --> 12:15.996

Can you take me to the me
Little--

15:10.387 --> 15:12.868
What? No, no, no, no.
You're not going in the hostel.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.739
You would never want to travel
again.

15:14.783 --> 15:17.090
We're going to my place,
you're going to love it.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.179
Look at how beautiful the lights
are.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.528
Come on, baby.

15:20.571 --> 15:23.879
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.315
Woooo!

15:25.359 --> 15:27.187
I love America.

He's here.

17:07.548 --> 17:10.724
[laughter]

17:10.768 --> 17:13.205
You need to wait here.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.425
Hey!

17:16.905 --> 17:18.037
No, that's right.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.217
Hey, have a beer with us.

17:24.260 --> 17:27.089
You can have it now.
You can have it now, take it.

17:27.133 --> 17:30.005
Life is too short to miss one
beer.
Come on.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.095
If you know what is good for
you,
just keep walking.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.662
What did you say? What--

17:34.705 --> 17:36.968
I'm sorry.
Would you mind repeating that
to me?

17:37.012 --> 17:38.274
I'm so sorry.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.450
No, wait, wait.
He's just drunk. I'm so sorry.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.235
Just get him out of my face.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.672
Okay, fine.

17:48.328 --> 17:49.764
[foreign language]

17:50.112 --> 17:51.722
I was just inviting him to a
beer.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.594
I'm just inviting him a beer.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.119
I was okay. I say, I say, I say.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.034
Hey, I could have taken that
pip.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.601
Oh my God.
Sure you could, champ.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.778
You call this an apartment?
Yes.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.433
This is bigger
than the house I grew up in.

18:06.476 --> 18:07.738
You like this place, huh?

18:07.782 --> 18:10.045
French grade one, champion of
the world.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.525
Of the universe.

18:11.568 --> 18:13.744
Yes, and that he's recognized
what I'm fighting for.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.096
Okay, come on. Who's calling her
next.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.621
This is going to be
a weekend to remember.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.318
A weekend?
A weekend.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.798
Maybe a night to remember.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.131
Woah, woah, woah.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.830
Hey, you made for me.

18:56.483 --> 18:57.745
[whistles]

18:57.788 --> 18:59.486
This is going to be cool.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.493
[phone ringing]

19:07.929 --> 19:09.191
Tell me you found him.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.281
We are trying but--

19:12.325 --> 19:13.848
Time is valuable.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.720
We need that detonator.

19:17.504 --> 19:21.725
Find Rashid, and make him
understand
that this will not go very well

19:22.117 --> 19:23.597
if he doesn't come through.

19:24.380 --> 19:25.599
[slaps]

19:28.602 --> 19:31.431
I have his wife and daughter.
What more do you need me to do?

19:31.735 --> 19:33.694
If we miss this target tomorrow,

19:34.347 --> 19:36.740
we may not get another shot,
Sariq.

19:37.698 --> 19:40.309
He'll never be this fool
in a lot while again.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.181
I'm just helping you.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.399
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.012
It's so nice. The water is so
nice.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.710
Hey, come on, get in. Give me
this.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.059
Stop it, everyone's in.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.235
Come here, come here.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.932
Jump to the pool, come on.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.632
Not that way, someone'll see.
Take it off. Take it off.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.111
That's not wise. [laughter]

20:00.503 --> 20:01.635
[water splash]

20:01.678 --> 20:03.114
[howling]

20:03.158 --> 20:05.987
Fine. I'll come.

20:06.030 --> 20:12.080
[background noise]

20:12.385 --> 20:14.691
I understand.
Did you destroy the files yet?

20:14.735 --> 20:18.478
I'm taking that with me.
This place is too hot.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.263
I won't have time to destroy
them.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.918
Perfect. Just make sure you do.

20:23.961 --> 20:27.400
My brother, I trust no one else.

20:29.358 --> 20:32.970
Find Rashid and bring the
detonator.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.668
I will.

20:38.759 --> 20:43.851
[crosstalk]

20:54.949 --> 21:01.521
[tense music]

21:46.653 --> 21:51.048
[party music]

22:33.221 --> 22:35.049
Maybe you should let it go.

22:37.181 --> 22:41.272
I'm tired.
Do you know where I can sleep?

22:52.501 --> 22:53.981
Follow me.

22:54.024 --> 22:59.943
[music]

23:05.427 --> 23:10.563
[laughter]

23:16.090 --> 23:17.570
[sniffing]

23:38.286 --> 23:41.028
I don't want to do anything
I'm going to regret tomorrow.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.074
How would you know?

23:45.511 --> 23:47.121
How would you regret something

23:47.164 --> 23:49.776
if you did not take the chance
in the first place?

24:01.178 --> 24:03.877
I know I'm going to feel guilty
about it tomorrow.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.044
[laughter]

24:52.708 --> 24:58.975
[music]

25:12.859 --> 25:14.077
Morning.

25:22.869 --> 25:26.046
[?]
[door slam]

25:33.880 --> 25:35.316
Did you have a good night?

25:35.359 --> 25:36.578
[mumbling]

25:36.622 --> 25:38.624
No? As you wish. As you wish.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.016
No problem. No problem.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.975
Then I'll have my coffee
outside.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.238
[?].

25:46.022 --> 25:48.459
This man is sending me
to other organization, to other
brothers.

25:48.503 --> 25:51.114
We may not get another chance
after today.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.204
With one spoon of sugar.

25:54.248 --> 25:57.991
[music]

26:17.619 --> 26:20.100
We move now or we'll miss the
target.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.015
I need the detonator now.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.629
You seem to be forgetting,
Rashid,

26:27.673 --> 26:31.067
that Erich is sitting
right across the street from
your house

26:32.242 --> 26:33.635
and to me too.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.506
My wife, my children.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.296
You understand that, don't you?

26:53.089 --> 26:54.700
[grunts] [groans]

26:55.265 --> 26:57.703
You shouldn't play
with things that aren't yours.

27:14.807 --> 27:15.982
Pierre.

27:22.858 --> 27:26.906
Pierre? Where are you?

27:41.572 --> 27:43.052
[glass breaking]

27:50.494 --> 27:52.758
Pierre? Pierre.

27:53.410 --> 27:54.803
[gasps]

27:57.414 --> 27:58.546
Oh my God.

29:29.071 --> 29:31.334
[panting]

29:40.474 --> 29:42.345
[glass noise]

30:54.069 --> 30:55.897
I should really stop drinking.

31:01.947 --> 31:06.516
[sobbing]

31:19.051 --> 31:27.842
[foreign language]

31:37.330 --> 31:40.768
Heather.
It's okay. It's okay. It's just
me.

31:40.811 --> 31:42.030
It's okay. It's just me.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.902
Oh my gosh. Oh my God.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.947
[sobs]

31:46.556 --> 31:48.080
What happened, Heather?

31:48.123 --> 31:50.343
Go to the bathroom.
Get the emergency kit and
towel.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.475
It's in the bathroom. Under the
sink.
Go.

31:53.259 --> 31:54.651
Heather, talk to me.

31:54.695 --> 31:57.437
Talk to me. What happened? What?

31:58.090 --> 31:59.961
Pierre. Pierre.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.615
Where is Pierre? Where?

32:01.658 --> 32:02.833
In there.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.531
No, Astrid. Wait.

32:05.097 --> 32:07.316
Oh my god. Pierre.

32:09.144 --> 32:10.929
No.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.545
[hyperventilating]

32:29.295 --> 32:30.470
Stay here.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.058
Don't move.

33:00.195 --> 33:01.457
Oh, shit.

33:15.515 --> 33:18.561
[screaming]

33:18.605 --> 33:20.999
[background noise]

33:30.051 --> 33:31.226
We have to go.

33:31.705 --> 33:33.315
I can't leave him here.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.883
There is a bomb on the shelf.
It can go off at any moment.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.277
Come on.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.636
[groaning]

33:49.679 --> 33:52.073
[sobbing]

33:52.117 --> 33:54.380
Come on. [grunts]

33:54.902 --> 33:56.034
Astrid.

33:57.644 --> 33:58.949
Astrid.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.054
You'll be okay.
You're going to be okay.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.099
You're okay.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.362
We need to call the police.

34:20.406 --> 34:23.235
That is not an option right now.
Here.

34:23.757 --> 34:26.063
Pierre is dead
and Heather needs an ambulance.

34:26.803 --> 34:29.067
We call the police now and I go
to jail.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.242
As simple as that.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.636
So you deal with your drugs
here and there.

34:33.679 --> 34:35.333
Do you think they're going to
care

34:35.377 --> 34:37.553
when they see dead bodies
in the next room?

34:38.032 --> 34:40.165
Astrid, I had to make a deal
with the police.

34:42.471 --> 34:45.431
I was looking at a couple of
years
so I had to give them Ravel.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.302
You sold out Ravel?

34:48.389 --> 34:50.697
He owns half of Europe.
Are you insane?

34:50.739 --> 34:52.393
He has cops on his payroll.

34:52.438 --> 34:55.745
Yes. If he finds out where I am,
I'm as good as dead.

34:56.659 --> 34:57.965
No.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.662
Shit.

35:00.054 --> 35:01.795
What are we supposed to do now?

35:02.361 --> 35:05.059
Just sit here
and wait for them to kill us?

35:05.581 --> 35:09.455
We clean up as best as we can
and hopefully you didn't think
it was Pierre.

35:09.498 --> 35:10.760
Not that gun.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.501
[grunts]

35:15.287 --> 35:16.810
Oh my God.

35:16.853 --> 35:19.073
[background noise]

35:26.646 --> 35:27.821
Hey, you're okay.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.650
[groans]

35:36.221 --> 35:37.700
I'm sorry.

35:40.616 --> 35:41.791
[groans]

35:41.835 --> 35:43.619
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[background noise]

35:59.069 --> 36:00.506
[groaning]

36:06.294 --> 36:08.731
This isn't going to hurt. You're
okay.

36:09.950 --> 36:11.560
[glass noise]

36:13.083 --> 36:16.348
Now to your face. [whispers]

36:17.262 --> 36:22.310
[tense music]

36:35.802 --> 36:37.630
Okay. Okay. Careful.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.893
You're okay.

36:39.936 --> 36:41.503
Ow. Ow. Ow.

36:41.547 --> 36:42.765
Come on.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.854
The boy. What about the boy?

36:46.073 --> 36:47.509
Keep going.

36:51.644 --> 36:54.647
[French language]
Don't open the door to anybody,
understand?

36:54.690 --> 36:57.476
[French language]
The police will be here soon,
okay? Okay?

36:57.519 --> 36:59.260
Don't open the door to anybody.
Yes.

37:04.961 --> 37:11.054
[music]

37:47.961 --> 37:49.267
Oh shit.

38:08.460 --> 38:09.809
Go. Go.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.405
Who is this guy?
I don't know.

38:41.623 --> 38:42.798
[gunshots]

38:42.842 --> 38:44.670
He's going to his car.
Please calm down.

38:44.713 --> 38:45.845
What are we going to do?

38:45.888 --> 38:47.934
I can't calm down. Pierre is
dead.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.892
[car tire screeching]

38:56.943 --> 38:58.248
Has Abdel arrived yet?

38:58.988 --> 39:00.642
Abdel is dead.

39:00.686 --> 39:01.991
What?

39:02.557 --> 39:04.298
[?].

39:04.646 --> 39:07.388
There is a dead kid here
with Abdel's body.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.956
What about the computers? The
files?

39:09.999 --> 39:11.261
I don't see that.

39:11.305 --> 39:13.394
His desk has been wiped clean.

39:13.655 --> 39:14.874
Find them.

39:30.629 --> 39:31.978
Abdel is dead.

39:45.339 --> 39:46.819
[background noise]

39:57.046 --> 39:59.571
[phone ringing]

40:02.182 --> 40:03.444
Good morning, Elizabeth.

40:03.488 --> 40:04.750
Good morning, Edward.

40:04.793 --> 40:06.926
I thought about
what you told me yesterday.

40:07.448 --> 40:08.710
Perfect.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.277
I'm not resigning.

40:12.235 --> 40:15.674
I understand and I knew
I was going to get this phone
call.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.937
The truth is, I wouldn't resign
either.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.156
You have until Friday.

40:21.114 --> 40:22.681
Good luck with the conference.

40:23.551 --> 40:30.079
[applause]

40:30.689 --> 40:31.994
Thank you.

40:32.038 --> 40:33.518
Thank you all very much.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.652
Beneath The Ashes is but a
glimpse
into the world of terror.

40:39.001 --> 40:42.701
We've all seen the face of
terror
plastered on the news and the
internet,

40:44.311 --> 40:47.967
but what many people don't
understand
is how often that face changes.

40:49.055 --> 40:51.318
No matter how many terrorists
we take down,

40:51.361 --> 40:53.451
another one will always arise

40:54.408 --> 40:56.236
until we get to the head of the
snake.

40:58.368 --> 40:59.935
Over the last several years,

41:02.068 --> 41:04.287
my research has lead to the
identity
of the top men of the London
bombings,

41:04.984 --> 41:08.074
Erich Hau,
his stepbrother, Abdel Fariq,

41:09.249 --> 41:11.904
and their leader, Omar Al
Sawari.

41:12.687 --> 41:17.300
Taking men such as these
takes years of hard work and
patience,

41:18.693 --> 41:21.087
but taking these men down

41:21.696 --> 41:26.309
is the only way to ensure
a total collapse of their
organization.

41:27.093 --> 41:29.312
Since the 2005 bombings,

41:29.356 --> 41:34.100
my team and I have captured or
killed
12 of 20 most wanted terrorists
on the planet,

41:34.666 --> 41:39.497
but when men such as these
are still breathing,

41:39.975 --> 41:44.197
I can only consider
the war on terror a failure.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.287
Yes, sir.

41:47.330 --> 41:50.072
Mr. Remington,
can you comment on those

41:50.116 --> 41:55.556
who accuse you of profiting off
of the death of those in the
London bombing?

41:55.600 --> 41:58.690
I would like to make it
perfectly clear to everybody,

41:58.733 --> 42:01.040
and it's important to me
that you understand,

42:01.083 --> 42:05.610
that I do not make a profit off
of anyone's death, unlike Al
Sawari.

42:07.307 --> 42:08.830
All the profits from my book

42:09.091 --> 42:12.399
go to charities around the world
for victims of terror

42:15.141 --> 42:18.710
and any story that says
otherwise

42:20.233 --> 42:23.105
is just not true, and that's
that.

42:24.237 --> 42:25.978
Sir, there are those who argue

42:26.021 --> 42:28.850
that you are too focused
on the Al Sawari organization

42:29.111 --> 42:33.028
and that there are far more
dangerous terrorist cells
emerging everyday

42:33.289 --> 42:36.554
and that you should be removed
from your post at Interpol.

42:37.250 --> 42:39.121
Sir, we have a situation.

42:40.296 --> 42:43.996
I just got a report of two
bodies
found here in a Paris
apartment.

42:44.257 --> 42:46.607
There were explosive devices
there as well.

42:47.260 --> 42:49.915
One of the bodies
is identified as Abdel Fariq.

42:50.306 --> 42:51.743
Abdel Fariq?
Yes.

42:55.050 --> 42:58.706
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry,
something has just come up and
I must leave.

42:58.750 --> 43:01.143
I want to thank you all
for attending tonight

43:01.187 --> 43:03.102
and I appreciate everything.

43:03.145 --> 43:06.061
Thank you so much and please
take
a copy of my book on your way
out.

43:06.105 --> 43:07.149
Thank you.

43:09.195 --> 43:11.284
Two dead, one young kid, 20s.

43:11.327 --> 43:14.853
From the looks of it, he
stumbled
to something his eyes were
never meant to see.

43:14.896 --> 43:17.072
Abdel spots him,
quickly disposes of him.

43:17.116 --> 43:19.248
His prints were found
in the knife he used.

43:20.162 --> 43:23.078
[background noise]

43:26.821 --> 43:28.867
Check the evidence and report.
Okay.

43:29.824 --> 43:32.392
My inspector tells me
that you have a license ID.

43:32.435 --> 43:34.960
Correct.
The card belongs to one Olivier
Dumont,

43:35.003 --> 43:39.399
the other ones are three young
people
running with their bags.

43:39.660 --> 43:41.227
Dumont was one of them.

43:41.270 --> 43:44.230
He lives in an apartment next
door,
the broken door.

43:44.273 --> 43:45.579
Abdel Fariq?

43:46.058 --> 43:48.277
Blanche.
Yes.

43:52.542 --> 43:54.066
There he is.

43:54.109 --> 43:56.895
Puncture wound to the jugular,
he died in seconds.

43:57.156 --> 43:59.114
There are two types of blood,

43:59.158 --> 44:02.161
the second one belonging, most
likely,
to our other person of
interest.

44:04.859 --> 44:06.513
Can you give me a second?

44:06.556 --> 44:07.819
Yes.

44:08.167 --> 44:09.690
Thanks.

44:09.734 --> 44:15.827
[music]

44:29.797 --> 44:31.886
Question is, who got to Abdel?

44:32.670 --> 44:36.064
Well, Olivier Dumont
has a significant rap sheet,

44:36.412 --> 44:40.025
trust fund baby
of the global ex-pharmaceutical
fortune.

44:40.068 --> 44:42.680
French authorities brought him
in
a few years ago

44:42.723 --> 44:44.333
for possible drug trafficking.

44:44.377 --> 44:47.902
He cooperated, which led
to the arrest of the drug lord
Ravel

44:47.946 --> 44:50.383
and some of his runners and
enforcers.

44:50.426 --> 44:52.690
Dumont has been in hiding ever
since.

44:52.733 --> 44:54.648
Maybe you check on family and
friends.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.171
I'll make a team on it.

44:56.215 --> 44:58.043
You think Dumont's funding
Abdel?

44:58.565 --> 44:59.566
Hard to say.

45:00.175 --> 45:01.786
Abdel's been here for a while.

45:01.829 --> 45:04.614
The landlord said
he was getting ready to leave
soon.

45:04.658 --> 45:08.053
[music]

45:11.578 --> 45:13.275
You've got to see this.

45:14.189 --> 45:15.625
They got quite the hit list,

45:15.669 --> 45:18.890
the Golden Gate Bridge,
the Eiffel Tower, and you.

45:20.630 --> 45:22.197
Looks like I got a fan club.

45:25.940 --> 45:28.900
This guy here walked in
on something he shouldn't have
seen

45:28.943 --> 45:30.640
so Abdel had to get rid of him.

45:31.119 --> 45:35.123
I'm sure by now Al Sawari
has heard about his dead
commander.

45:36.951 --> 45:39.824
So whoever stopped this
and saved my life

45:41.477 --> 45:43.523
has now put their life in
danger.

45:43.915 --> 45:49.964

45:51.009 --> 45:57.929
[background noise]

46:33.921 --> 46:39.013
[music]

47:02.994 --> 47:04.778
No, no. Don't move.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.911
Astrid, stay with her.
I'll get some water.

47:07.215 --> 47:08.738
You're okay.

47:08.782 --> 47:14.919
[music]

47:14.962 --> 47:18.009
[background noise]

47:24.798 --> 47:26.887
It's been a long time
since I've been here.

47:26.931 --> 47:28.367
Since your divorce.

47:30.151 --> 47:31.457
Have you seen the brief?

47:31.761 --> 47:33.459
Yes, Blanche showed me today.

47:35.156 --> 47:36.462
They are after you.

47:36.854 --> 47:38.116
You got lucky.

47:39.291 --> 47:41.423
I also saw your brief on Al
Sawari.

47:42.250 --> 47:43.948
Al Sawari isn't done yet.

47:45.036 --> 47:47.647
He was going to plant a bomb
in Paris today.

47:49.083 --> 47:52.260
Aren't you politicians
even remotely concerned about
that?

47:53.000 --> 47:55.046
They just want to paint a new
picture.

47:55.307 --> 47:56.874
It gives them an impression.

47:57.309 --> 47:59.267
That's what the politicians care
about.

48:00.703 --> 48:02.923
You're still going to be
terminated
on Friday.

48:03.184 --> 48:04.577
What about those kids?

48:04.620 --> 48:06.057
They're still in danger.

48:06.535 --> 48:08.189
You don't care about those kids.

48:08.711 --> 48:10.235
You have so much hatred.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.194
I don't believe you.

48:15.544 --> 48:16.894
Quinoa?

48:19.679 --> 48:20.898
Sure.

48:22.595 --> 48:24.031
Can I help you?

48:24.510 --> 48:27.730
[background noise]

48:35.695 --> 48:37.088
I'm not hungry.

48:38.306 --> 48:39.960
You have to eat something.

48:40.004 --> 48:41.614
You lost a lot of blood.

48:44.399 --> 48:45.792
How are you feeling?

48:47.272 --> 48:49.100
I've been better, but I'm fine.

48:53.365 --> 48:55.323
What exactly happened this
morning?

48:57.021 --> 48:58.718
I found Pierre dead,

49:02.026 --> 49:04.332
and then,
this guy come out of nowhere,

49:05.029 --> 49:07.422
started chasing me
around his apartment.

49:08.902 --> 49:10.948
I don't even know how I killed
him.

49:13.994 --> 49:15.648
We need to call the police.

49:15.691 --> 49:18.259
It was self-defense.
I didn't do anything wrong.

49:19.521 --> 49:22.829
She's right.
Olivier, we have to call the
police.

49:23.743 --> 49:25.788
I didn't do anything wrong.

49:31.620 --> 49:33.057
[sighs]

49:36.103 --> 49:37.496
Okay.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.937
Toxicology report on Pierre
Chareau
came in off the charts.

49:43.981 --> 49:46.548
Looks like he and his friends
were partying there.

49:46.592 --> 49:48.376
Which puts them near the crime
scene.

49:48.420 --> 49:50.248
Which fills tight into your
theory

49:50.291 --> 49:53.686
that they must've stumbled
into something they weren't
meant to see.

49:53.729 --> 49:55.079
Yes.
Got something else.

49:55.122 --> 49:57.995
A pharmacist called in
about a suspicious trio.

49:59.213 --> 50:01.476
Which matches
the witnesses' descriptions?

50:01.520 --> 50:04.305
Yes, one of them
had several lacerations and
injuries.

50:04.349 --> 50:05.567
I had stills in my office

50:06.090 --> 50:07.569
Should be in by now.

50:12.139 --> 50:14.576
See there, Olivier Dumont.

50:14.837 --> 50:18.145
The girl with them was ID
as Astrid Van Wyck, Olivier's
girlfriend.

50:18.667 --> 50:20.452
What about the injured girl?

50:20.495 --> 50:23.672
Hard to believe she might be
the one who encountered Abdel
Fariq.

50:23.716 --> 50:24.978
Yes. Right.

50:27.198 --> 50:29.591
There were multiple prints
at the crime scene.

50:29.635 --> 50:33.378
They all match to everyone else
that was there but none to our
mystery girl.

50:33.421 --> 50:35.336
Nobody has reported anybody
missing?

50:35.380 --> 50:36.946
No, nothing on that yet

50:36.990 --> 50:39.862
but we did match Dumont's plates
to his Mustang convertible.

50:39.906 --> 50:41.255
How long till a warrant?

50:41.299 --> 50:43.344
I have a team working on it,
two or three hours.

50:43.388 --> 50:44.432
Excellent.

50:44.476 --> 50:45.564
Blanche here.

50:51.178 --> 50:52.397
Oh my God.

50:54.486 --> 50:56.053
Who leaked this?

50:58.098 --> 50:59.969
Al Sawari is one step ahead of
us.

51:19.641 --> 51:22.035
Olivier, you need to see this.

51:22.731 --> 51:26.431
By now, the world knows
that one of our brothers has
fallen,

51:26.866 --> 51:28.433
Abdel Fariq.

51:28.781 --> 51:32.045
I promise that there'll be
consequences
for his death.

51:32.567 --> 51:35.092
A retaliation from us is
inevitable.

51:35.918 --> 51:37.877
People will die until

51:38.573 --> 51:41.010
we find those responsible.

51:42.229 --> 51:43.752
To those responsible,

51:43.796 --> 51:47.713
if you're watching this,
I urge you to turn yourself in

51:47.756 --> 51:50.629
and spare thousands of innocent
lives.

51:51.456 --> 51:53.501
This is your only warning.

51:56.200 --> 51:57.940
What are we going to do?

52:05.948 --> 52:08.255
[knock]

52:16.002 --> 52:17.351
Who is it?

52:17.395 --> 52:19.005
Private security.

52:21.312 --> 52:23.792
What do you want?
No one here called for
security.

52:25.446 --> 52:29.189
Garage door was open
so I need to check in if
everything is okay.

52:45.945 --> 52:47.468
Bonsoir.
Bonsoir.

52:49.340 --> 52:52.778
Garage door was open
so I need to check in if
everything is fine.

52:52.821 --> 52:54.127
Everything is fine.

52:55.389 --> 52:56.999
I left it open. It's my fault.

52:57.826 --> 53:00.351
Even though it's your fault,
I still need to check in.

53:07.967 --> 53:09.098
Okay.

53:13.973 --> 53:17.629
So, is it just you two?

53:17.890 --> 53:20.371
Yes. Just me and my girl.

53:25.027 --> 53:31.033
[struggles]

54:01.325 --> 54:02.848
[gunshots]

54:13.250 --> 54:18.472
You are okay, you are okay,
you are okay.

54:26.872 --> 54:28.482
Fuck.

54:30.832 --> 54:32.181
Shit.

54:35.620 --> 54:37.230
Hey, what are you doing?

54:37.274 --> 54:38.797
I'm calling the police.
Stop.

54:38.840 --> 54:40.146
Don't you get it?

54:40.189 --> 54:42.279
They found us faster than the
police.

54:43.192 --> 54:44.890
Then I'm calling my father.

54:46.195 --> 54:47.588
What are you doing?

54:47.632 --> 54:50.199
Anyone looking for us
can track us through these.

54:53.942 --> 54:55.379
Give me your phone, Heather.

54:56.031 --> 54:58.382
Heather, your phone.

55:02.081 --> 55:03.430
We're going to Spain.

55:03.474 --> 55:04.953
What's in Spain?

55:05.867 --> 55:08.740
I know a guy
who can give us some passports.

55:08.783 --> 55:11.482
I don't want passports,
I don't even want to go to
Spain.

55:11.525 --> 55:13.614
I want to call my father.
We are leaving.

55:13.875 --> 55:16.313
I don't know who that fucking
guy was.

55:16.356 --> 55:18.097
I don't know why she killed him.

55:18.663 --> 55:20.839
Once we get to Spain
we can call your father

55:20.882 --> 55:22.449
then see what he can do for us,

55:23.015 --> 55:24.495
but until then,

55:24.930 --> 55:26.540
I don't want to die,

55:29.717 --> 55:31.066
so you decide.

55:45.864 --> 55:47.996
Looks like Al Sawari beat us
again.

55:48.040 --> 55:49.824
And yet these kids survived?

55:49.868 --> 55:51.652
For how long I don't know.

55:51.696 --> 55:54.046
They took out their GPS.
Okay.

57:36.104 --> 57:37.410
We should be here soon.

57:47.246 --> 57:48.769
All this is crazy.

57:50.597 --> 57:52.512
Hey, you said you wanted an
adventure.

57:52.556 --> 57:53.818
How can you say that?

57:53.861 --> 57:55.994
Pierre is dead and I killed
someone.

57:57.604 --> 57:58.823
I'm sorry.

57:59.606 --> 58:02.000
Pierre was my friend, you know?

58:04.568 --> 58:05.917
I'm scared too.

58:08.833 --> 58:10.051
Very scared.

58:19.452 --> 58:21.019
It's so beautiful here.

58:28.200 --> 58:32.160
We should get going.
I need real food and a shower.

58:33.074 --> 58:34.511
Yes, a shower.

58:38.340 --> 58:39.690
You are such a jerk.

58:42.344 --> 58:49.003
[music]

59:31.655 --> 59:33.308
Is your friend meeting us here?

59:33.352 --> 59:35.093
No, I still need to track him
down.

59:35.354 --> 59:37.574
We need to stay out of sight
in the meantime.

59:45.146 --> 59:47.714
We have Dumont's car.
It was spotted in Spain.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.673
How quickly can we get there?

59:49.716 --> 59:51.631
I have a charter waiting at the
airport.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.952
Commander Diaz, good to see you
again.

01:00:07.995 --> 01:00:11.259
You as well, my friend, though I
wish
it were under different
circumstances.

01:00:11.303 --> 01:00:13.348
Well, I guess we'll just never
learn, will we?

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:15.568
Diaz, this is Inspector Claudine
Blanche.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.701
She's been on my team now for
the last nine years.

01:00:17.744 --> 01:00:19.920
My pleasure.
Welcome to Spania, inspector.

01:00:19.964 --> 01:00:21.400
Thank you.

01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:23.489
Diaz and I,
we worked on the Madrid
bombings, yes.

01:00:23.532 --> 01:00:24.838
Yes, old days.

01:00:24.882 --> 01:00:26.623
Your police officer told us

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:29.756
that they have a confirmed
sighting
of the trio on a local hotel?

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.151
Yes. The manager in the
establishment
identify all three suspects.

01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:34.761
Excellent.

01:00:34.805 --> 01:00:37.285
I could organize a team
to go in and secure the
suspects.

01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:40.071
No, if we go in now,
we're going to lose Al Sarwi.

01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:42.551
You're going to use them as
bait?
For now.

01:00:43.248 --> 01:00:47.078
This could be our best chance
at drawing out key personnel in
his network.

01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:51.691
Stay on them.
Back on the clock, everyone.

01:00:53.954 --> 01:01:00.047
[music]

01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:13.017
Fermin, mi hermano.

01:01:13.626 --> 01:01:15.106
It's been a long time, my
friend.

01:01:15.149 --> 01:01:16.629
Olivier, what's up, men?

01:01:16.934 --> 01:01:19.980
I know I should have called,
but I was in the area.

01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:22.722
These girls with you?
Yes, they're with me.

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:24.985
We need a favor from Tadeo.

01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:26.204
Favor?

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:32.253
All right, let's go. This way.

01:01:35.517 --> 01:01:36.823
Tadeo's out back.

01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:44.701
Oye, guapo.
Hey, handsome.

01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:47.007
¿Tienes fuego?
Do you have a light?

01:01:47.051 --> 01:01:49.096
Sí, mamita. Para ti, sí.
For you, of course.

01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:03.023
Gracias.
Thank you.

01:02:03.067 --> 01:02:04.242
De nada.
You're welcome.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.900
Está buena, coño.
She's hot.

01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:16.645
Oh, yes, look there.

01:02:18.865 --> 01:02:21.215
You could put some ears
to that window.

01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:22.869
We're already on it.

01:02:22.913 --> 01:02:25.698
Carmen, if you can get closer
to the left hand window there.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:26.960
On it. Yes.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.839
She's in place.

01:02:35.882 --> 01:02:37.797
That's Carmen,
my top intelligence agent.

01:02:38.363 --> 01:02:39.930
We had her on the patrol nearby.

01:02:39.973 --> 01:02:42.193
We know she would be
the best one for the assignment

01:02:42.236 --> 01:02:44.021
since the area's a hotbed
for working girls.

01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:45.457
Come here, you fuck.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.241
Whoa. Are you crazy, man?

01:02:47.285 --> 01:02:49.940
I should be asking you the same
thing.
What are you doing here?

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:52.899
Your fucking face is all over
the TV,
and you're trying to get me
pinched?

01:02:52.943 --> 01:02:54.379
Sorry. I didn't know.

01:02:55.162 --> 01:02:57.164
You didn't know? You?

01:02:58.513 --> 01:03:00.907
When you kill
one of Interpol's most wanted,

01:03:00.951 --> 01:03:02.996
you tend to end up in the news,
Olivier.

01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:05.042
I didn't know what else to do.

01:03:08.088 --> 01:03:10.264
Here I thought
you were one of the smart ones.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.311
You know what?

01:03:13.354 --> 01:03:17.097
I should kill you, turn your
body in,
and save a headache.

01:03:17.141 --> 01:03:18.795
All too good. [?].

01:03:19.404 --> 01:03:21.754
You know that guy you killed,
Abdel Fariq?

01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:26.019
Belongs to the Al Sarwi Network,
a big fish for the Interpol.

01:03:27.455 --> 01:03:28.848
Jesus.

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:30.981
Okay, I saw the bombs. Okay?

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.897
I thought he was just some crazy
working on his own.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.855
You thought, you thought, you
thought,

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:39.511
and then you and these two
go inside to show yourself.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.339
Good.

01:03:41.687 --> 01:03:43.297
Very good. Excellent.

01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:45.822
Very good. Except this one.

01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:49.738
They haven't been able
to identify her yet,

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:53.351
so she might be still safe
for the time being.

01:03:54.004 --> 01:03:56.180
What did you say your name was?
Heather.

01:03:56.484 --> 01:03:57.703
Heather.

01:03:58.399 --> 01:04:00.227
Pleasure to make your
acquaintance.

01:04:01.663 --> 01:04:03.665
[foreign language]

01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:08.018
Unfortunately, not for long.

01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:12.936
You see, if they come in here
right now
looking for the three of you,

01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:15.025
there's not a damn thing
I can do about it.

01:04:15.068 --> 01:04:16.330
Here we go,

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.898
and we're locked in.

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:20.204
Locked on. They're in.

01:04:20.247 --> 01:04:23.555
Look, I came to you
because I was desperate.

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.078
Okay?

01:04:25.557 --> 01:04:27.211
We used to do business together.

01:04:28.647 --> 01:04:30.214
Now, I need your help.

01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:32.520
Olivier, a lot of people
come to me for help,

01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:35.219
but nobody brings me this kind
of heat.

01:04:35.915 --> 01:04:38.962
For all I know, there's
a line of cops outside wanting
to bust in.

01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:40.354
There are no cops outside.

01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:43.923
We disembarked in Paris,
and we came to you to keep it
that way.

01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:47.579
All we need are passports,
documents, files,

01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:49.581
anything to get us out of [?].

01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:51.191
[sighs]

01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:03.769
I'm going to help you
with the paper work.

01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:05.162
I will,

01:05:06.076 --> 01:05:07.816
but only in one condition,

01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:11.211
after this,

01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:13.953
I don't want to ever see you
again.

01:05:14.693 --> 01:05:15.912
Okay?

01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:19.089
I have to turn my back on you,
Olivier.

01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:23.006
Once my services are rendered,
you're on your own.

01:05:23.832 --> 01:05:25.182
You are dead to me now.

01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:26.661
Do you understand?

01:05:28.098 --> 01:05:29.664
Same goes for the two of you.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.670
How much will this set me back?

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.282
20,000 euros.

01:05:39.413 --> 01:05:43.940
Consider the extra tax you pay
a hazard charge

01:05:44.853 --> 01:05:46.290
When can it happen by?

01:05:46.551 --> 01:05:47.944
Come by tomorrow morning.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.163
Tomorrow?

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:52.383
What do you mean tomorrow?
We can all be in jail or dead.

01:05:52.426 --> 01:05:53.732
I'm sorry, Olivier.

01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:55.995
I just don't see
how is that any of my concern?

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:58.693
You said we need to make it out
of here
as soon as possible, Tadeo.

01:05:58.737 --> 01:05:59.999
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:03.872
You want quality, that takes
time. Okay?

01:06:03.916 --> 01:06:06.701
This is not some kind
of fast food restaurant
services.

01:06:06.745 --> 01:06:08.225
I don't know. Do you?

01:06:08.268 --> 01:06:09.617
Hide out, lay low.

01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:11.576
It's just one day.

01:06:12.098 --> 01:06:13.360
One day.

01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:15.580
Fine, but we still have an
issue.

01:06:15.841 --> 01:06:16.973
Which is?

01:06:18.409 --> 01:06:21.673
I don't have any money,
but you know I can get it.

01:06:21.716 --> 01:06:23.501
You know how this works,
Olivier?

01:06:23.544 --> 01:06:25.938
It's cash upfront, or nothing.

01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:27.984
You can find somebody else to do
it.

01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:32.901
How about something else in
return?

01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:34.991
Something else?

01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:36.688
Well, that depends.

01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:45.914
Will that be enough?

01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:54.010
You really know me well,
Olivier.

01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:58.362
You got yourself a deal.

01:07:00.755 --> 01:07:02.366
Now, if you don't mind,

01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:05.238
I do have some pressing matters
to attend to, so--

01:07:05.282 --> 01:07:11.201
[music]

01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:16.815
They're leaving. They're leaving
now.
All teams in place, follow the
target.

01:07:16.858 --> 01:07:23.039
[music]

01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:25.563
Carmen, it's Remington.
Hold your position.

01:07:25.606 --> 01:07:27.695
All others, eyes and ears on the
three kids.

01:07:27.739 --> 01:07:29.045
Good job, Carmen.

01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:34.137
Lets just hope
your friend comes through.

01:07:34.398 --> 01:07:35.573
He always does.

01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:37.966
Then what? What are we going to
do?

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:39.968
Go home?

01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:42.754
No. Well, at least not right
now.

01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:45.061
Then where?

01:07:45.409 --> 01:07:47.541
I don't know. Brazil, maybe.

01:07:48.151 --> 01:07:49.369
No extradition there.

01:07:49.413 --> 01:07:51.632
We can stay in Brazil
until things cool down.

01:07:51.676 --> 01:07:52.981
I don't want to go to Brazil.

01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:55.854
I want to go home, back to my
life.

01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:58.161
I don't deserve to be here.

01:07:58.204 --> 01:07:59.901
I didn't do anything.

01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:02.165
This is all her fault.

01:08:02.513 --> 01:08:03.731
My fault?

01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:05.298
Yes, your fault.

01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:07.561
What was I supposed to do?
Let him kill me?

01:08:07.605 --> 01:08:11.348
Maybe. I don't know. I don't
care.

01:08:11.391 --> 01:08:13.176
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:08:13.219 --> 01:08:14.916
Astrid, you need to calm down.
Okay?

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.527
She did what was necessary.

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:18.398
And because of that,
we're all going to wind up
dead.

01:08:18.442 --> 01:08:20.835
Stop it. Okay?
I would have done the same
thing.

01:08:20.879 --> 01:08:22.402
Go ahead. Stand up for her.

01:08:24.448 --> 01:08:26.102
Do you think that I'm stupid?

01:08:27.973 --> 01:08:29.756
Do you think that I don't see
what's going on between the two
of you?

01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:32.846
What are you talking about?
I see the way you look at her,
Olivier.

01:08:33.326 --> 01:08:34.893
Is that what this is all about?

01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:37.330
We have dangerous people after
us,

01:08:37.374 --> 01:08:39.158
and this is what's running
through your mind?

01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:42.118
I'm Just sick of it. I'm sick of
all this.

01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:43.988
My dad has a security team,

01:08:44.032 --> 01:08:46.033
they can actually make sure
nothing happens to me.

01:08:46.078 --> 01:08:47.948
You show your face out there
and you're dead.

01:08:47.993 --> 01:08:49.299
I'll take my chances.

01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:51.562
I don't care anymore. You can
have him.

01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:55.609
Wait, Astrid?

01:09:07.752 --> 01:09:09.100
[foreign language]

01:09:09.841 --> 01:09:11.669
Sir, Astrid is on the move.

01:09:11.712 --> 01:09:12.844
Standing by.

01:09:12.886 --> 01:09:15.063
Astrid is on the move. She's
alone.

01:09:16.326 --> 01:09:17.587
Follow her.

01:09:18.023 --> 01:09:20.330
Yes, sir. Follow her. Go, go,
go.

01:10:03.547 --> 01:10:09.335
[background noise]

01:10:09.683 --> 01:10:11.990
There seems to be
some kind of demonstration

01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:13.339
about a hundred foot ahead.

01:10:14.166 --> 01:10:15.602
Do you have footage on that?

01:10:20.868 --> 01:10:23.915
If she goes into that
demonstration,
we're going to lose her.

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:30.051
[background noise]

01:10:44.675 --> 01:10:46.285
Grab her.

01:10:46.329 --> 01:10:48.766
[background noise]

01:10:48.809 --> 01:10:50.115
We have her. We have her.

01:10:50.158 --> 01:10:51.334
They've got Astrid.

01:10:51.377 --> 01:10:52.944
[foreign language].

01:10:54.772 --> 01:10:56.643
They're taking Astrid to the
station.

01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:58.558
It would take us five minutes to
get there.

01:10:58.602 --> 01:11:00.168
Let's go to the station.

01:11:00.212 --> 01:11:06.000
[music]

01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:28.936
In the drugstore,

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.288
Olivier Dumont and Astrid Van
Wyck
bought medical supplies.

01:11:33.114 --> 01:11:35.029
People close to them

01:11:35.073 --> 01:11:39.164
confirm that
Van Wyck and Dumont are dating.

01:11:40.034 --> 01:11:42.559
They met as tourists

01:11:42.907 --> 01:11:46.040
at a prestigious Monaco resort.

01:11:51.959 --> 01:11:53.961
I apologize for what Astrid
said,

01:11:55.006 --> 01:11:56.224
about everything.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:57.835
It's okay.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:59.532
It doesn't matter now.

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:05.973
[music]

01:12:25.036 --> 01:12:28.126
I can honestly say that
this isn't what I was expecting

01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:30.128
when I said I wanted an
adventure.

01:12:33.305 --> 01:12:35.220
I mean, even if I make it out of
this,

01:12:36.047 --> 01:12:37.875
my life's never going to be the
same.

01:12:39.833 --> 01:12:42.270
I mean, the thought
of actually killing someone.

01:12:44.011 --> 01:12:46.144
This is why
you never thought I'd have to
do.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.886
You did what you had to do.

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:51.715
You should be proud of that.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.022
Most people will just lay down
and accept their fate,

01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:57.895
but you're a fighter.

01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:04.336
I'm glad I met you.

01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:07.165
Even with this face?

01:13:10.211 --> 01:13:11.561
I like your face.

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:23.834
I'm tired.

01:13:25.705 --> 01:13:26.967
Go sleep.

01:13:27.446 --> 01:13:28.882
I'll take a shower.

01:13:28.926 --> 01:13:35.106
[music]

01:13:52.906 --> 01:13:55.300
[phone ringing]

01:13:56.823 --> 01:13:58.999
Hello.
Are you crazy?

01:13:59.043 --> 01:14:00.523
Excuse me?

01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:03.700
The chief of dispatch police in
Madrid
just called me.

01:14:04.048 --> 01:14:07.573
He said that you are putting the
lives
of the kids and the people at
risk.

01:14:07.617 --> 01:14:11.621
Look, Elizabeth, I'm doing my
job,

01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:14.711
and I'm still running things
until tomorrow.

01:14:15.015 --> 01:14:17.148
Just keep those kids safe.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.150
I can take it, Elizabeth.

01:14:19.193 --> 01:14:21.152
You don't even care about the
kids.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:23.415
People are calling me and
complaining.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.591
I have London calling, Holland,
Madrid.

01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:27.027
The list goes on and on.

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:29.377
Look, the Dutch girl is fine.

01:14:29.421 --> 01:14:31.989
She's going to be reunited
with her father tomorrow,

01:14:32.032 --> 01:14:33.381
and I promise,

01:14:33.904 --> 01:14:35.514
I promise you,

01:14:36.776 --> 01:14:38.474
those other kids will make it
out.

01:14:39.126 --> 01:14:40.650
Just keep them alive.

01:14:41.259 --> 01:14:42.478
Alive.

01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:47.395
It's not their fault
that you're putting them at
risk.

01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:50.311
You know what?

01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:52.662
I kind of like that, Heather.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.229
She took care of Abdel,
and she's tough.

01:14:55.273 --> 01:14:56.883
She'd make a great agent.

01:14:57.275 --> 01:15:00.321
This is not the time
for you giving recommendations.

01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:03.934
Tomorrow night at 6:00,
you'll be done with Interpol.

01:15:04.369 --> 01:15:06.066
And you can rest without me.

01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:09.461
Edward?

01:16:52.825 --> 01:16:54.044
It's him.

01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:56.089
Take your time.

01:16:56.133 --> 01:17:01.965

01:17:53.799 --> 01:18:00.023
[music]

01:18:16.953 --> 01:18:18.911
They escaped again,

01:18:20.652 --> 01:18:24.177
but tomorrow they pick up
passports
from one of our contacts.

01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:30.009
[music]

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:28.606
[foreign language] Hello,
handsome.

01:20:28.649 --> 01:20:29.999
How are you?

01:20:33.524 --> 01:20:35.831
[foreign language] Okay,
darling. And you?

01:20:36.266 --> 01:20:39.051
[foreign language] You know, my
days are always beautiful.

01:20:40.661 --> 01:20:42.402
I don't know if you noticed,

01:20:43.186 --> 01:20:44.665
but there aren't many people.

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:47.016
You should look on another
street
for work.

01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:50.019
He's going to find her out.

01:20:50.062 --> 01:20:52.325
He's going to make her.
Just give her a second.

01:20:52.369 --> 01:20:53.805
[foreign language] Yes, I
noticed,

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:57.374
but my friend, Roxana,
told me this place was okay,

01:20:58.941 --> 01:21:02.858
unless you know someone feeling
lonely

01:21:04.076 --> 01:21:05.817
and in need of

01:21:06.687 --> 01:21:08.211
a woman like me.

01:21:09.386 --> 01:21:10.778
I need money.

01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:15.566
I can give you a discount
if you bring me two or three
guys.

01:21:15.914 --> 01:21:17.611
[chuckles]

01:21:24.009 --> 01:21:26.882
[foreign language] I can't, I'm
on duty.

01:21:30.755 --> 01:21:32.278
Find another guy.

01:21:32.322 --> 01:21:35.716
[foreign language] Well, your
loss.

01:21:37.066 --> 01:21:38.502
She is delicious.

01:21:39.285 --> 01:21:40.896
Work is shit.

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:47.990
In position.

01:21:57.477 --> 01:21:59.392
Olivier,

01:22:00.089 --> 01:22:02.134
your computer.

01:22:02.787 --> 01:22:04.441
That's not my computer.

01:22:15.017 --> 01:22:16.670
This is why they're after us.

01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:18.977
We have to go.

01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:25.027
[music]

01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:33.513
Hey.

01:22:37.822 --> 01:22:40.956
[background noise]

01:22:41.782 --> 01:22:43.741
Go.

01:22:43.784 --> 01:22:50.008
[background noise]

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.686
[?]. This is it. They're being
chased.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:19.342
We have eyes on the target.
They're being chased across the
building.

01:23:26.088 --> 01:23:32.268
[background noise]

01:23:34.096 --> 01:23:35.271
Come on, jump.
No.

01:23:35.314 --> 01:23:36.707
We have to jump.

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:42.017
[background noise]

01:23:48.327 --> 01:23:49.807
Come here, come here.

01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:04.822
Confirm, they're coming down.

01:24:04.865 --> 01:24:07.172
They're coming down the fire
escape
right now.

01:24:11.002 --> 01:24:14.049
[background noise]

01:24:15.137 --> 01:24:16.355
You okay?

01:24:16.399 --> 01:24:20.142
[background noise]

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.600
Hey, stop. Stop.

01:24:43.643 --> 01:24:45.384
To the wall. To the wall. To the
wall.

01:24:45.428 --> 01:24:47.169
[foreign language] Against the
wall.

01:24:47.212 --> 01:24:48.605
On your knees

01:24:50.128 --> 01:24:51.782
[foreign language] Hands up.

01:24:52.174 --> 01:24:53.653
We got the [?] under control.

01:24:53.697 --> 01:24:55.612
They've got them.
Can they send a photo?

01:24:55.655 --> 01:24:57.614
Can you send a photo across?
Yes.

01:24:58.005 --> 01:24:59.659
[?].

01:24:59.703 --> 01:25:01.400
Perfect. It's coming across now.

01:25:04.621 --> 01:25:06.101
It's Rashid.

01:25:07.972 --> 01:25:09.234
[?]

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:12.716
Yes, that's him.

01:25:13.456 --> 01:25:14.761
Two more.

01:25:19.201 --> 01:25:20.463
[door knocking]

01:25:20.767 --> 01:25:22.029
Come in.

01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:28.210
Give this to the Director of
Operations.

01:25:32.866 --> 01:25:34.041
Stop.

01:25:34.085 --> 01:25:35.391
Hold up, man.

01:25:37.044 --> 01:25:38.089
Boss says he's on alert.
He says you might have some
heat.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.395
I've got to check you.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.403
Now her.
No, she's not wearing a wire.

01:25:47.446 --> 01:25:49.666
We just want to go in there
as quickly as possible.

01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:52.190
If I'm not sure,
you guys get to turn around
without your stuff.

01:25:52.234 --> 01:25:53.496
Is that what you what?

01:25:53.887 --> 01:25:55.498
Okay, fine.

01:26:05.812 --> 01:26:08.511
I got Olivier and his girl. [?].

01:26:10.295 --> 01:26:11.731
Let them in.

01:26:11.992 --> 01:26:13.733
Copy. Let's go.

01:26:16.214 --> 01:26:17.694
[foreign language]. Take them.

01:26:22.002 --> 01:26:23.395
On my way.

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:28.835
Yes, we can see you. Copy that.

01:26:30.402 --> 01:26:33.449
Hombre, right on time.

01:26:33.492 --> 01:26:35.277
Just the two of you?
Yes.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.713
Where's the Dutch girl?

01:26:36.756 --> 01:26:39.106
She's taking her chances
and going back to Holland.

01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:44.242
You know there's a lot of people
from here to the Atlantic
looking for you.

01:26:44.286 --> 01:26:46.113
I doubt she'd make it far.

01:26:46.636 --> 01:26:49.291
Yes, well, that is her problem
now.

01:26:50.466 --> 01:26:52.207
How are you two holding up?

01:26:52.685 --> 01:26:56.080
Fine, considering how many times
we're almost killed.

01:26:56.689 --> 01:26:58.082
Coffee?

01:26:59.953 --> 01:27:01.259
I love coffee.

01:27:02.129 --> 01:27:04.610
Always with two spoons of sugar.

01:27:05.307 --> 01:27:06.699
You have the papers?

01:27:06.743 --> 01:27:08.223
Papers?

01:27:09.049 --> 01:27:11.051
Yes, I got the papers.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.228
No refunds by the way.

01:27:13.532 --> 01:27:16.883
I made the Dutch girl her
papers,
so I've got to charge you.

01:27:17.362 --> 01:27:19.146
It would be unlikely if you
didn't.

01:27:19.886 --> 01:27:21.497
Ain't she a beauty?

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:24.848
That's a 1983 [?] transmission.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.111
You don't see one every day, do
you?

01:27:27.894 --> 01:27:29.592
We really need to get going,
Tadeo.

01:27:31.028 --> 01:27:33.073
Young people, always in a rush.

01:27:34.597 --> 01:27:36.425
Venga. Follow me.

01:27:48.001 --> 01:27:49.307
[foreign language] Hey, girl.

01:27:49.742 --> 01:27:51.135
Girl.

01:27:51.178 --> 01:27:53.746
[foreign language] Oh my God,
you scared me, boy.

01:27:54.312 --> 01:27:57.359
I am a good girl. I won't cause
you any trouble.

01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:59.056
Listen.

01:27:59.317 --> 01:28:02.146
[foreign language] I need you to
go right now.

01:28:02.494 --> 01:28:04.322
Look for another place to work.

01:28:05.062 --> 01:28:08.892
I promise I'll be a good girl.

01:28:08.935 --> 01:28:12.896
I won't cause you any trouble.

01:28:12.939 --> 01:28:14.854
This property belongs to Tadeo.

01:28:14.898 --> 01:28:17.901
You understand? Move. Now.

01:28:19.381 --> 01:28:21.296
Don't make me angry. Now.

01:28:21.339 --> 01:28:24.777
[foreign language] Okay, I move.
You don't have to be so rough.

01:28:25.778 --> 01:28:27.258
Your loss.

01:28:36.615 --> 01:28:39.966
By the way, Olivier,
I made you a great Canadian
passport.

01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:42.621
You're now [?].

01:28:42.839 --> 01:28:44.231
Something like that.

01:28:46.059 --> 01:28:49.106
Heather, you're now an American
by the name of Ashley
Scarborough.

01:28:49.802 --> 01:28:53.676
Of course, we have wasted
a very good work on the Dutch
girl,

01:28:54.764 --> 01:28:59.334
but you did pay for it and it is
yours.

01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:01.510
We're in the office.

01:29:09.082 --> 01:29:10.693
Sir, we have a problem.

01:29:11.084 --> 01:29:12.825
What's going on?
[hushes]

01:29:12.869 --> 01:29:16.307
Sir, there's four suspicious
cars
coming from the south alley.

01:29:19.136 --> 01:29:22.531
They're going through the main
entrance.
Waiting for instructions.

01:29:25.403 --> 01:29:27.057
What's happening?
What's going on?

01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:29.059
Sir, do you read me?

01:29:30.147 --> 01:29:31.366
Fix it.

01:29:31.409 --> 01:29:32.932
Carmen, can you hear me? Carmen.

01:29:32.976 --> 01:29:35.370
Sir? Sir, do you read me?

01:29:37.154 --> 01:29:39.243
Okay, everybody standing by
on my account.

01:29:41.332 --> 01:29:43.552
Snipers?
Yes, ma'am. Ready.

01:29:43.595 --> 01:29:45.118
Team one.
Ready set.

01:29:45.162 --> 01:29:46.381
Team two.
Ready, ma'am.

01:29:46.424 --> 01:29:47.817
All right. Standby.

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.174
Can anybody see them?

01:29:57.217 --> 01:30:03.049
[music]

01:30:12.624 --> 01:30:14.496
I've got your passports right
here.

01:30:16.715 --> 01:30:20.415
I'm sure you will be
very impressed with the work.

01:30:22.112 --> 01:30:23.853
One, two, three.

01:30:25.115 --> 01:30:26.595
All yours.

01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:32.992
We thank you. We've got to go.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.169
You are not going anywhere,
Olivier.
Sit.

01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:39.216
Sit down.

01:30:39.608 --> 01:30:40.957

[?]

01:31:05.329 --> 01:31:07.636
I insist you know this person?

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:11.466
That was Abdel as a young man.

01:31:12.858 --> 01:31:16.427
His father held me
when I testified before God of
Shiva.

01:31:17.646 --> 01:31:19.212
He was my family

01:31:21.127 --> 01:31:22.520
until you killed him.

01:31:24.261 --> 01:31:25.784
We've been looking for this.

01:31:31.007 --> 01:31:36.969

01:31:46.544 --> 01:31:47.806
Good.

01:31:50.635 --> 01:31:52.724
Is your greed never enough?

01:31:53.159 --> 01:31:54.726
You had to sell us out?

01:31:57.642 --> 01:31:59.339
Can somebody see something?

01:32:00.384 --> 01:32:02.734
Sir? Do you read me?

01:32:05.607 --> 01:32:06.956
Oh shit.

01:32:11.264 --> 01:32:12.962
[foreign language] Hello,
handsome. Remember me?

01:32:13.005 --> 01:32:14.703
[foreign language] I told you to
disappear, to get lost.

01:32:15.312 --> 01:32:18.271
[foreign language]
Police, mother fucker. On your
knees. Move.

01:32:21.623 --> 01:32:23.450
Can we confirm that's him?

Hey, [?]?

01:33:38.917 --> 01:33:40.615
Nothing personal.

01:33:49.232 --> 01:33:51.103
Now you just did make it
personal.

01:33:51.147 --> 01:33:53.453
[foreign language] Put on the
fucking battery.

01:33:56.369 --> 01:33:58.458
[foreign language] Put on the
battery. [?].

01:34:01.723 --> 01:34:03.028
Olivier,

01:34:08.033 --> 01:34:09.687
you know all you've got do,

01:34:10.819 --> 01:34:15.301
is tell this fine gentlemen
what they want to know.

01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:26.661
Once you do that,

01:34:30.577 --> 01:34:33.755
it'll be all over.

01:34:33.798 --> 01:34:41.023

01:35:32.248 --> 01:35:34.424
[grunting]

01:35:35.947 --> 01:35:37.557
He's going to kill them.

01:35:39.385 --> 01:35:42.562
Erich is not going to shoot
anybody
without Al Sarwi authorization.

01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:15.291
[?] Please.

01:36:16.509 --> 01:36:18.076

01:36:26.345 --> 01:36:27.869
Stop. Stop, it was me. It was
me.

No. It was me.

01:36:35.398 --> 01:36:36.747
Lovebirds.

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.662

01:36:50.848 --> 01:36:52.154
No, please don't.

01:36:58.551 --> 01:36:59.770
I've got Erich.

01:37:00.075 --> 01:37:01.467
They have Erich.

01:37:04.731 --> 01:37:05.863
Wait.

01:37:06.385 --> 01:37:07.778
Last chance.

01:37:08.387 --> 01:37:09.736
Who killed Abdel?

01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.913
It was me. Kill me.

01:37:17.353 --> 01:37:18.789
[?].

01:37:22.749 --> 01:37:25.056
Al Sarwi is there. Go.

01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:26.231
Go.

01:37:28.494 --> 01:37:38.069
[gunshots]

01:38:06.445 --> 01:38:08.099
Are you okay? Which way did they
go?

01:38:08.143 --> 01:38:09.231
That way.

01:38:15.237 --> 01:38:23.506
[gunshots]

01:38:31.383 --> 01:38:32.907
[?].

01:38:38.042 --> 01:38:39.522
Fuck you.

01:38:39.826 --> 01:38:46.007
[gunshots]

01:39:02.893 --> 01:39:04.503
[?].

01:39:05.765 --> 01:39:07.028
[?].

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.214
Don't stop.

01:39:19.692 --> 01:39:21.956
Go, go. Go, go, go. Go.

01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:25.916
Go, go, go. Go, go.

01:39:34.098 --> 01:39:38.015
[gunshots]

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:44.065
All personnel,
Edward is no longer in command.

01:39:44.108 --> 01:39:47.111
I repeat,
Edward is no longer in command.

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:54.075
[gunshots]

01:39:57.078 --> 01:39:58.775
Hey, you. Move.

01:40:00.342 --> 01:40:03.475
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:40:05.042 --> 01:40:06.348
Stop.

01:40:17.141 --> 01:40:18.664
Continue with the operation.

01:40:18.708 --> 01:40:20.231
Edward is still in command.

01:40:20.492 --> 01:40:23.539
It's irrelevant.
We've just received this memo
signed.

01:40:24.366 --> 01:40:25.715
That's an order.

01:40:32.765 --> 01:40:34.115
Good luck, my friend.

01:40:35.377 --> 01:40:36.943
Al Sarwi.

01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:49.565
It's over, Al Sarwi.

01:40:50.174 --> 01:40:52.089
There's nowhere to go.
Surrender.

01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:56.833
I will kill her.

01:40:57.964 --> 01:40:59.140
It's over.

01:41:01.403 --> 01:41:02.708
I will kill her.

01:41:12.805 --> 01:41:14.285
Let her go, Al Sarwi.

01:41:17.854 --> 01:41:19.116
Just let her go.

01:41:21.553 --> 01:41:23.207
I will kill her.

01:41:30.867 --> 01:41:31.998
Let her go.

01:41:34.262 --> 01:41:37.395
[gunshot]

01:41:38.483 --> 01:41:39.615
Edward.

01:41:40.964 --> 01:41:42.139
Edward.

01:41:43.836 --> 01:41:45.751
[grunts]

01:41:46.317 --> 01:41:47.753
[screams]

01:41:48.319 --> 01:41:49.929
[gunshot]

01:41:49.973 --> 01:41:51.453
[groans]

01:42:10.254 --> 01:42:12.038
You're a hard girl to find.

01:42:13.562 --> 01:42:14.824
What's your name?

01:42:17.653 --> 01:42:18.915
Heather.

01:42:21.004 --> 01:42:22.266
Heather.

01:42:27.228 --> 01:42:28.707
Heather.

01:42:35.018 --> 01:42:42.068
[music]

01:42:52.383 --> 01:42:55.169
Blanche, I know it sounds
strange,
but I want to make this.

01:42:55.212 --> 01:42:58.215
[?] and the girl is going to be
okay,
and I trust his instincts.

01:42:58.259 --> 01:43:00.174
Bring her to the headquarters in
Paris.

01:43:16.973 --> 01:43:23.458
[music]

01:43:31.596 --> 01:43:33.076
I'll be back in two minutes.

01:43:42.999 --> 01:43:46.698
[sirens blaring]

01:43:47.569 --> 01:43:49.614
[panting]

01:43:50.093 --> 01:43:51.355
Are you okay?

01:43:52.661 --> 01:43:53.966
It's all over.

01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:02.410
We're going to take you guys
down to Interpol headquarters

01:44:02.453 --> 01:44:05.021
and take your statements,
then you're free to go.

01:44:06.892 --> 01:44:08.024
Hey.

01:44:08.416 --> 01:44:10.069
What was in the laptop?

01:44:12.376 --> 01:44:13.595
Everything.

01:44:15.074 --> 01:44:17.120
Network, files, plans of attack,
names, phone numbers.

01:44:17.163 --> 01:44:19.557
With Al Sarwi gone,
they'll start to fracture.

01:44:19.862 --> 01:44:21.167
It's a start.

01:44:22.343 --> 01:44:24.127
I'm sorry about your partner.

01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:26.608
Yes, thanks.

01:44:30.786 --> 01:44:32.657
We have a car coming to get you,

01:44:33.005 --> 01:44:35.312
take you down to headquarters,

01:44:35.356 --> 01:44:37.488
you can look around
and consider my offer.

01:44:39.055 --> 01:44:40.404
Offer?

01:44:40.448 --> 01:44:41.971
Yes. I work in Parisville.

01:44:42.319 --> 01:44:43.886
We could use someone like you.

01:44:43.929 --> 01:44:46.758
Your strength and resiliency,
that can't be taught.

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.545
I have a friend in Paris.

01:44:51.502 --> 01:44:55.811
Well, I could pull some strings,
post you in the Paris office.

01:44:56.551 --> 01:44:58.161
Let me know.

01:44:58.204 --> 01:45:04.167
[music]

01:45:08.214 --> 01:45:09.651
How do I look?

01:45:14.569 --> 01:45:17.180
Terrible.
[chuckles]

01:45:23.099 --> 01:45:29.018
