WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.736
Next customer.

00:05.206 --> 00:09.243
Um, can I get a kid's meal?

00:09.277 --> 00:11.312
Huh?
What was that, sir?

00:11.345 --> 00:13.581
Can I get a kid's meal?

00:13.614 --> 00:16.084
Speak up. There's
a lot going on here, honey.

00:16.117 --> 00:19.053
Can I get a kid's meal?

00:19.087 --> 00:22.656
I don't see no kids.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.924
Yeah, I don't have
a kid with me.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.493
I'm gonna eat it.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.761
Well, only a kid can order
a kid's meal.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.997
That's not true.
I know that's not true.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.866
Oh, yeah, it is.
Only a kid can order it.

00:32.900 --> 00:36.270
So a kid has to wait in line
and order a kid's meal.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.439
A kid can't get
an adult meal?

00:38.472 --> 00:39.873
Look here, sir,
you have to be

00:39.907 --> 00:41.209
14 or younger
to get a kid's meal.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.043
I've just been made
day manager,

00:43.077 --> 00:45.379
and I didn't get that title
by handing out discounted meals.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.548
Look, you don't have to be a kid
to get a kid's meal, okay?

00:47.581 --> 00:49.583
Do you have to be a Evander
Holyfield to get the champ?

00:49.617 --> 00:51.552
Okay, do you have to be
fucking Chubby Checker

00:51.585 --> 00:52.786
to get the Chubby Decker?

00:52.820 --> 00:54.788
Do you need to have
a long foot to--

00:54.822 --> 00:57.091
that one doesn't translate,
but you know--

00:57.125 --> 00:58.626
This is ridiculous, okay?

00:58.659 --> 01:01.795
Can I just please get
a kid's meal?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.534
Can I get a cup for water?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.437
Sure.
Here you are.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.705
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

01:11.739 --> 01:12.773
Next.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.461
(Kodak Black's "Skrt"
playing)

01:33.494 --> 01:40.468
*

01:40.501 --> 01:44.672
* Girl, I'm done with you

01:44.705 --> 01:48.776
* Girl, we done,
it's through *

01:48.809 --> 01:52.012
* I hit that
for the work *

01:52.045 --> 01:55.416
* Stick and move,
then I skrt, skrt, skrt *

01:55.449 --> 01:56.784
* Skrt, skrt

02:01.722 --> 02:03.257
We need to get
a new revenue system.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.958
I'm getting paid
direct deposit tomorrow,

02:04.992 --> 02:06.427
but it's not gonna be a lot.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.796
I barely signed anyone up
at the airport.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.299
You only get paid
a commission, though, right?

02:11.332 --> 02:12.833
(scoffs)
You might as well sell drugs.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.802
Yeah.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.307
How do you make money?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.175
I sell drugs.
It's lucrative.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.677
Yeah, man, it's easy.
People are addicted to them.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.780
Mm-hmm.
Sell it till you get rich.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.849
How else you pay
for studio time,

02:28.882 --> 02:32.220
clothes, videos, and weed
without a lame-ass job?

02:32.253 --> 02:34.822
Yeah, but, you know,
you're more famous now.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.990
Your profile's risen,
which means more risk, you know?

02:37.024 --> 02:38.359
You can't go to jail, man.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.693
We'll be careful
out there, man.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.161
Out where?

02:41.195 --> 02:43.464
Highway.
Got to see the Mexicans.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.966
Going to see the Migos.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.301
You know I'm going strapped.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.302
(blows)

02:48.336 --> 02:52.039
(muted TV sounds in background)

02:52.072 --> 02:54.041
Yeah, well just--

02:54.074 --> 02:55.643
just try not to die.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.578
Every day.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.149
Yeah, just so y'all know,

03:02.182 --> 03:05.719
there's probably a bullet
in here somewhere.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.388
Noted.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.189
(hip-hop plays in background]

03:09.223 --> 03:11.124
(door opening)

03:13.126 --> 03:16.864
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey, what's up?

03:16.897 --> 03:18.599
All right, honey,
time to go to bed.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.571
Hi.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.205
No, don't get up.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.907
I wouldn't want you
to have to pick up Lottie

03:26.940 --> 03:28.576
and ruin all that
you're doing.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.110
I just got here.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.079
I thought you were gonna
pick her up today, right?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.414
Honey,
is it really that hard

03:33.447 --> 03:35.215
to help me out
every once in a while?

03:35.249 --> 03:37.285
I even have to take her
to your parents' place myself.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.686
Really, Earn?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.220
Is this about having to
bail me out?

03:40.254 --> 03:42.055
Please, you really think
you're the first boy

03:42.089 --> 03:43.724
I've bailed out of jail?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.526
Yeah.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.295
EARN: I was working
at Al's all day.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.229
Yeah? You smell like work.
What is that?

03:49.263 --> 03:50.864
-Kush?
-Super Jack.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.132
Nigga, don't.

03:52.165 --> 03:55.135
Don't what?
Be happy?

03:55.168 --> 03:56.937
I never ride you for you doing
what you want to do

03:56.970 --> 03:58.606
with your life.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.742
No, you roll your eyes at me
and you call me crazy

04:01.775 --> 04:03.477
any time I try
to tell you something.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.148
I guess that's just me, right?
I'm crazy-ass Vanessa.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.119
(exhales sharply)
Whatever.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.594
I've been inconsiderate.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.131
I get it.
I'm sorry.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.844
What are you doing tomorrow?
I want to take you to dinner.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.847
-No, it's too late.
-It's too late?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.682
Yeah, you messed up.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.953
Can I buy you dinner
and watch you eat it

04:45.986 --> 04:47.821
from across the room?

04:47.855 --> 04:49.590
You know, I can get
one of those corny niggas

04:49.623 --> 04:51.859
to eat it with you.
I know you love them.

04:51.892 --> 04:56.530
"Oh, I love your energy.
My dreads are in a bun.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.298
"Hey, have you heard
any music from the '90s?

04:58.332 --> 04:59.700
-It's all amazing."
-You know what?

04:59.733 --> 05:03.203
You're lucky that I like
corny-ass dudes.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.373
Mm-hmm.
Talking about you.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.844
Why are you always turning me
into the angry black woman?

05:10.878 --> 05:12.980
-'Cause you are.
-Are you kidding me?

05:13.013 --> 05:15.148
-I'm the stereotype?
-Mm-hmm.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.784
While your ass,
you can't even take care

05:16.817 --> 05:18.185
of your own goddamn kid?

05:18.218 --> 05:19.720
I'm fine with being
a stereotype.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.489
-It's working out great for me.
-Really?

05:21.522 --> 05:25.493
Yeah, obviously I'm in a bed
and I'm technically homeless.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.727
It's pretty great.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.063
(laughing)

05:30.097 --> 05:32.232
I don't know about all that.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.372
It was a hard day.
(sniffing)

05:38.406 --> 05:40.040
-You like it.
-I love it.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.009
(chuckles)

06:05.032 --> 06:07.067
(groans)

06:07.100 --> 06:09.870
Come on, dog.
How are you broke on payday?

06:09.903 --> 06:11.905
What are you,
"12 Years a Slave"?

06:11.939 --> 06:14.708
Yeah, my name is
"12 Years a Slave."

06:14.742 --> 06:15.843
-The slave.
-Shut up, nigga.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.177
You don't know his name.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.779
I gotta take Van out
on this date.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.614
And then the math of the money
I need for the week,

06:20.648 --> 06:23.216
including this MARTA card,
I only have $62 left over.

06:23.250 --> 06:27.120
Yo, yo, yo, $62 is plenty enough
to go on a date, man.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.189
Well, you--hey, you know what?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.591
Take her out
to the Indigo Lounge.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.093
What's that?

06:33.126 --> 06:35.062
It's a little spot
in mid-town I go to.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.797
Taking a couple of my hos.
(chuckles)

06:36.830 --> 06:39.933
You know, the ones I really
like, like Eve and Jessica.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.035
Yeah, dog.
It is nice in there.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.804
And, you know the best part
about it?

06:43.837 --> 06:47.240
They got the happy hour menu
popping all night after 7:00.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.109
-Word?
-Yeah.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.878
It's nice in there, man.
You'll like it, dog.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.279
Drinks be like five bucks.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.814
Should go check it out, bro.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.717
A'ight. Bet.
I'll talk to you later.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.652
Yes, sir.
Hand dog out.

07:02.289 --> 07:06.827
Yo, I know you was not just
listening to my conversation.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.097
Girl, you are some mess.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.484
Shit,
I might just win tonight.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.958
MAN: Hey, man.
It's gonna be quick, a'ight?

07:37.991 --> 07:39.860
Don't let Earn spook you
and shit.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.695
-Spook me?
-Mm-hmm.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.364
Man, I ain't scared of nothing.
I got Daddy right here.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.000
(hip-hop playing)

07:47.034 --> 07:49.369
-You call your gun "Daddy"?
-Yes.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.205
That's weird, man.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.643
Is it weird when your girl
call you "Daddy"?

07:55.676 --> 07:57.878
Man, that's completely
different, and yes, yes.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.947
It is.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.381
All right,
what about Papi?

08:01.414 --> 08:03.016
I know you ain't got no problem
with Papi.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.652
Man, Papi, that's like...

08:06.319 --> 08:07.555
Cultural.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.489
Oh.
Oh, okay.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.559
Because it's Spanish,
now all the sudden, it's sexy.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.860
Look,
that shit always creepy.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.161
Man, if a bitch called me
"Daddy,"

08:14.194 --> 08:15.996
man,
something wrong happened.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.197
Real talk.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.901
Yo, you not gonna see this,

08:20.934 --> 08:24.037
but your assumed perversion
of the word "Daddy,"

08:24.071 --> 08:26.707
I think that's stemming from
the fear of mortality, man.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.881
-What you call your gun?
-Nigga, gun.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.516
(phone vibrates)
Hold on.

08:38.418 --> 08:41.021
Ah, it's on.
9:00 tonight.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.591
(trills, laughs)
Let's do it.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.694
I'm gonna handcuff
the briefcase to my wrist.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.495
Why?

08:48.528 --> 08:49.930
'Cause it's professional,
nigga.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.599
We ain't no duffel bag boys.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.735
Okay.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.775
(mellow hip-hop music)

09:01.809 --> 09:03.744
*

09:03.777 --> 09:07.047
I don't...
see any parking here.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.116
I don't know.
This is kind of a weird street.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.884
No, no, it's good.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.053
I think
we should just valet.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.388
No, no, I'll find
street parking, okay?

09:15.422 --> 09:18.358
Patience.
Patience, young Vanessa.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.895
(mellow hip-hop plays]

09:21.929 --> 09:23.764
Ah, see?
Perfect.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.799
-Wait, here?
-Yeah.

09:25.833 --> 09:29.102
-No, I don't think so.
-Come on, it'll be fun.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.904
-Oh. Oh, no.
-There we go.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.106
I don't know.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.242
Why don't you go ahead and park
it right here, young blood?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.044
Don't be scared, darling.
Just smellin' hard work on me.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.979
-That's all.
-Oh, I know. I know.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.781
No, you're fine till midnight.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.149
Uh, you guys close
at midnight?

09:42.182 --> 09:43.917
Uh, no, no, sir.
Street gang.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.886
They--they like out come out
at around 11:00,

09:45.919 --> 09:47.621
vandalize the cars
and joyride 'em.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.489
Not a large cop presence
around here, huh?

09:49.522 --> 09:50.991
Well, no,
but the towing companies.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.459
But don't worry
about getting towed,

09:52.492 --> 09:53.894
'cause like I said,
I'm out here.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.462
You see these five cars, right?
These my people.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.230
And if you eat over there
at that restaurant over there,

09:57.264 --> 09:58.632
I'll come over there
and let you know

09:58.666 --> 09:59.900
if you gotta move it
real quick.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.134
Okay, I'm sorry, but, like,

10:01.168 --> 10:02.469
what kind of a parking lot
is this?

10:02.502 --> 10:03.737
Because it seems
janky as hell.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.238
No, no,
it ain't no parking lot.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.940
No, I found
this vest over there

10:06.974 --> 10:08.175
at the Kroger shopping center.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.677
And this here
is a lightsaber.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.845
Luke Skywalker.

10:11.879 --> 10:14.614
-How much--how much is it?
-Uh, $10.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.983
That's how much
the valet costs.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.584
-Well, $8.
-Oh, uh-uh.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.352
Earn, you are taking my car
to valet right now.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.688
I'm sorry,
this is ridiculous.

10:20.721 --> 10:21.855
-I'm sorry.
-$6.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.290
-Good night.
-Come on, now.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.126
Hey, we all we got.
Hey, come on.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.327
EARN: $6 isn't bad.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.263
Hey!

10:30.297 --> 10:31.264
(funky pop plays)

10:31.298 --> 10:32.165
I'm gonna hit it, man.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.133
both: * Your

10:33.166 --> 10:34.101
I'm gonna hit that one.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.169
both: * Good love

10:36.203 --> 10:39.406
* Deserves an encore

10:40.874 --> 10:45.178
* Your good love

10:45.212 --> 10:48.315
* Deserves an encore

10:50.150 --> 10:51.584
(music stops)

10:52.920 --> 10:54.988
You know how to get
to Main Street?

10:55.022 --> 10:57.925
Change of plans.
Follow me.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.699
(Shabazz Palaces'
"An Echo From the Hosts

11:05.733 --> 11:09.036
That Profess Infinitum"
playing)

11:09.069 --> 11:16.043
*

11:16.076 --> 11:18.846
* All that diamond dust

11:18.879 --> 11:21.081
* Flowin' up your hose

11:21.114 --> 11:23.016
* Flamboyant obstacles

11:23.050 --> 11:24.718
* Deals made to cope

11:24.752 --> 11:27.354
* Wow
Ignore the truths *

11:27.387 --> 11:29.723
* Shots at all
of these soft, huh? *

11:29.757 --> 11:31.691
* Ideas in recline

11:31.725 --> 11:33.193
* Rise of the lost

11:33.226 --> 11:35.195
* Yea, yea

11:35.228 --> 11:37.564
* Yea, yea

11:37.597 --> 11:40.200
The hell is this?

11:40.233 --> 11:42.135
These niggas are tripping.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.580
(music plays distantly)

11:53.613 --> 11:55.048
Hey.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.984
Did you get the handcuff key
off the table?

12:06.293 --> 12:09.062
(Max P's "Gang" playing)

12:09.096 --> 12:11.765
Hey, Qua.
They're here.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.266
Hey, yo, bring 'em in.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.537
-What's happening?
-Ah, you know.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.106
Busy, busy.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.874
What the hell you mean,
nigga?

12:20.908 --> 12:22.742
-Trapping bored as fuck.
-(chuckles)

12:22.776 --> 12:24.444
Yeah, but you know
how it is.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.815
-(speaks indistinctly)
-Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.516
Hey, hold up, hold up.
We gotta handle this first.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.953
Go on.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.761
* And if my cuz slackin' I'll
pay to see my bro get 'em *

12:41.795 --> 12:43.596
-(grunts)
-Sh--

12:43.630 --> 12:45.498
You ain't gotta do this.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.800
Please.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.836
What the fuck?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.804
(man crying)

12:50.838 --> 12:53.006
Get this nigga his clothes.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.507
(sobbing)

12:54.541 --> 12:57.477
Please, man, Q, come on.
Don't do this to me, yo.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.613
Hold up, put your clothes on,
man, it's cold out here.

13:00.647 --> 13:04.351
-(whimpers)
-* If you don't gang bang

13:04.384 --> 13:08.755
* Gang bang,
gang, gang, gang *

13:08.788 --> 13:10.490
* Diamonds on my neck,
my chain swanging *

13:10.523 --> 13:11.825
(mouthing words)

13:11.859 --> 13:13.894
(man mumbling tearfully)

13:14.995 --> 13:16.830
Are you guys ready to order?

13:16.864 --> 13:19.699
Yeah, I haven't been able
to find your happy hour menu.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.335
-Oh, we don't do that anymore.
-What?

13:22.369 --> 13:24.304
Yeah, we got a new owner
from New Orleans.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.606
He's kind of changing it up.
We do mostly seafood now.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.142
Not the tapas and stuff,
but it's really good.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.478
Well, I think I'm gonna start
with a drink.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.346
-Okay.
-Um, I was looking

13:33.380 --> 13:36.149
at the Bayou Breeze,
but what do you think?

13:36.183 --> 13:37.817
Should I get that or the wine?

13:37.851 --> 13:39.887
Definitely the Bayou Breeze.
It's my favorite.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.890
-Okay, okay.
-It's a house special, yeah.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.824
Um, what are
your soups of the day?

13:44.858 --> 13:46.860
We have Aunt Zora's
seafood soup.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.128
It has a lot in it.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.163
Like fish, crab, mussels,
squid.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.465
$28.
Do you have anything else?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.067
No, that's the only soup
we offer.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.835
-No, that sounds really good.
-It's so good.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.504
You're gonna love it.
Well, I was think--

13:57.537 --> 13:59.739
You know, the shrimp puffs
go really great with that soup.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.674
I'm gonna throw in
an order of those, too.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.144
For free?
(laughter)

14:04.177 --> 14:05.545
-You can share them with her.
-Yeah.

14:05.578 --> 14:06.880
It'll be a good idea.
We can share.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.181
We'll share them.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.516
Can I get you
something to drink?

14:09.549 --> 14:11.084
Uh, tap water's fine.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.220
Earn, I can't drink
by myself.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.857
Do you have
a Miller High Life?

14:17.891 --> 14:19.326
-Like the ones in the can?
-(chuckles)

14:19.359 --> 14:21.761
We got a hipster.
(laughter)

14:21.794 --> 14:23.263
-Yeah.
-Okay.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.198
Do you know what you want
for your entree, Miss?

14:25.232 --> 14:26.566
I'm actually not sure.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.235
What do you think
about the catfish filet?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.203
Well, it's okay,
but actually tonight,

14:30.237 --> 14:32.239
we have a special grilled
scallop and lobster meal.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.740
It's incredible.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.342
You guys seem like
you're having a special night.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.944
That meal would be perfect.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.912
-That sounds really good.
-It's market price.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.948
-That means it's fresh.
-It's really fresh.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.582
-Yeah, I'm gonna have that.
-Okay, great.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.118
I will be right back
with those drinks.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.819
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.392
Who are you texting?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.096
Nothing, no one.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.330
What?

14:58.831 --> 15:00.133
Oh, you're doing that weird

15:00.167 --> 15:02.102
sad boy face you get sometimes.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.271
That's just my face.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.373
I have to look like that.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.841
What, um--how--how's work?

15:10.343 --> 15:12.879
Actually, oh, my God,
it has been crazy.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.814
Did I tell you about
that girl, Janine, last week?

15:14.847 --> 15:16.383
She was sniffing Wite-Out
in my class.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.551
Yeah, I think--I want to hear
about this,

15:18.585 --> 15:21.121
but I have to check
on one thing, one thing.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.559
Hey, could you
ring up my order

15:26.593 --> 15:27.927
and tell me how much
I'm spending?

15:27.961 --> 15:29.997
I just got something
that's market price.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.332
Wow.
Broke as fuck, my nigga.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.302
Yes.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.938
(man sobbing)

15:38.972 --> 15:40.607
Please, y'all.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.410
(whispers)
Did you check your shoes?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.512
Why the fuck would the key
be in my shoes?

15:45.545 --> 15:48.181
Stop being scary, nigga.
Figure it out.

15:48.215 --> 15:51.851
You know what, Marcus?
I'ma let you go.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.154
(whimpering)

15:54.187 --> 15:56.789
You know my son, man.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.758
-Please don't, man.
-Start heading that way, man.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.361
It's all good.
You'll find the city.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.763
(whimpering)

16:03.796 --> 16:05.632
Shit.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.368
(whimpering)

16:08.401 --> 16:12.772
Ah, shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.807
Oh, shit, shit. Oh, shit.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.309
Hand me Percy over there.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.513
No, no, no.
No, no, no. Shit.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.219
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.754
(gunshot)

16:31.924 --> 16:33.726
(gunshot)

16:35.328 --> 16:37.330
* Gang, gang, gang, gang
gang *

16:37.364 --> 16:39.132
Hmm.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.869
* Diamonds on my neck,
my chain swanging *

16:45.372 --> 16:46.739
Did you check your jacket?

16:46.773 --> 16:48.175
(exhales)

16:48.208 --> 16:50.110
Yeah, man.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.650
I just think we need

16:57.684 --> 17:01.054
a chance as humans
to...fail

17:01.088 --> 17:05.092
in order to discover
what actually works, you know?

17:05.125 --> 17:07.594
People don't think there's
a process to being happy.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.696
(soft dinner music plays)

17:09.729 --> 17:11.864
So what do you want?

17:14.767 --> 17:17.170
I don't know.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.740
I mean, I guess I just
want a chance to find out.

17:20.773 --> 17:21.941
Who doesn't?

17:21.974 --> 17:23.443
Mm.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.749
I get the whole
"follow your dreams" thing,

17:29.782 --> 17:34.254
but, um, our daughter needs
all the tools to survive,

17:34.287 --> 17:36.623
and...

17:36.656 --> 17:38.958
that includes you, Earn.

17:38.991 --> 17:45.865
*

17:45.898 --> 17:47.667
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.976
Uh-oh.
Does she need a brownie sundae?

17:57.009 --> 17:58.378
We'll just take the check.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.779
How about I go get
the dessert menu,

17:59.812 --> 18:01.448
and I'll come back
and we can--

18:01.481 --> 18:03.650
Just get us the check and stop
trying to upsell me on shit.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.318
You're killing me tonight.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.120
You've been fucking
killing me.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.558
Okay.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.561
(dinner music continues)

18:14.594 --> 18:17.730
*

18:17.764 --> 18:20.300
(breathes)
Fuck...

18:20.333 --> 18:23.570
So, Al, tell me how
you disappeared and then show up

18:23.603 --> 18:26.506
out the blue
with this big-ass order, man.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.808
Man, you know
I'm rapping, man.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.910
It ain't been that long now.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.846
Rapping?
You just got arrested, dog.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.484
No. Uh, I didn't--
(scoffs)

18:37.517 --> 18:39.919
-No, man. Arrested?
-For murder.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.521
You was locked up
for murder, right?

18:41.554 --> 18:44.791
Now you back?
Man, that's kinda fast, dog.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.329
Man, he nervous as hell.
Look at him.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.030
He's shaking.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.866
Well, it's a drug deal,
so it's total vibes.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.503
Yo, yo, are we gonna--we gonna
do business or like...

18:56.536 --> 19:02.475
(phone vibrating)

19:05.745 --> 19:07.180
You gonna answer that?

19:07.214 --> 19:09.982
(continues vibrating)

19:10.016 --> 19:12.219
Put that motherfucker
on speakerphone too, man.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.456
(clears throat)

19:16.489 --> 19:19.359
Hello, cousin.
How are you today?

19:19.392 --> 19:21.494
Listen, man,
can you do me a huge favor

19:21.528 --> 19:23.330
and put $20 in my account,
like,

19:23.363 --> 19:26.633
transfer it over ASAP, like,
you gotta help me out, man.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.701
-All right.
-Really?

19:28.735 --> 19:31.070
(exhales/laughs)
Thanks, man, you--

19:31.103 --> 19:32.905
You're saving my ass.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.041
Okay, man, well, you know
I gotta go now.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.743
Okay, cool.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.512
So, what are you guys doing
right now?

19:39.546 --> 19:40.747
You and Darius do that deal?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.382
Do not know what
you mean.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.517
The ones with the Mexicans,
you guys had the guns.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.419
You guys were, like, "We ain't
scared of you guys," you said.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.754
Yo, okay, man,
all right, nigga.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.356
Sending money.
All right, peace out.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.759
Man...
(stammering)

19:52.792 --> 19:56.696
-Good guy. He's legit.
-With all that, yeah.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.698
He's cool.
Why didn't you tell him--

19:58.731 --> 20:00.933
Stop talking, man.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.669
It's weird that your card
didn't work

20:02.702 --> 20:04.604
the first two times
they swiped it.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.507
Yeah...
[exhales] let's go.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.742
Wait, wait, wait.
You're not tipping her?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.944
Come on, it's not enough
that she makes less than you

20:11.978 --> 20:13.313
because you got a dick?

20:15.081 --> 20:17.216
Have some class.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.020
No, I'm just here to see...

20:21.053 --> 20:23.356
Mr. Fogle, they towing your car.
Come on.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.458
Come on.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.861
Hey, man, my bad
for all of them guns, man.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.630
You know, we had to make sure
you was straight.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.299
We heard some weird shit
about you, man.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.100
(door opens)

20:34.133 --> 20:35.735
Hey, sorry I'm late.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.639
Paper Boi, right?

20:39.672 --> 20:41.608
I'll fuck with
that postal mixtape. (laughing)

20:41.641 --> 20:43.610
All right, man.
Okay.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.712
-(laughing)
-Yeah.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.414
Yeah, all right.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.582
-Who dat?
-That's my cousin, Tanqueray.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.050
I told you we rap now,
right?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.752
-No, word?
-Yeah, he good,

20:52.785 --> 20:54.621
but he talks a lot,
you know, he crazy.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.088
But anyway,
let's settle this deal.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.991
-Let's get it handled.
-Okay.

20:59.025 --> 21:02.295
Well,
it's in the briefcase.

21:02.329 --> 21:06.065
Uh, but I-I left the key
at home.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.835
So--kinda stuck.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.605
We can solve that.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.516
See,
we'll just take the money,

21:23.550 --> 21:26.085
and y'all get to keep
the briefcase.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.687
-It's easy.
-Cool.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.789
-We see y'all.
-All righty.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.761
Hey, yo,

21:34.794 --> 21:36.463
what'd you call
ya'll group, man?

21:36.496 --> 21:39.499
-We the Migos.
-Yeah.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.000
That Four Migos.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.970
We're inseparable.
(chuckles)

21:48.541 --> 21:51.511
(crickets chirp, owl hoots)

21:51.544 --> 21:53.312
(inhales deeply)

21:53.346 --> 21:56.248
Man, that nigga look like
he gonna die tonight.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.488
There is a security job
at the office building,

22:01.521 --> 22:03.656
so you could save for a car,

22:03.690 --> 22:05.458
and then you wouldn't have to
take our daughter

22:05.492 --> 22:07.293
on the bus with weirdos.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.530
I'm gonna become somebody
I hate at a job like that.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.899
Well,
you're doing that already.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.635
You know, being a rapper
is something

22:15.668 --> 22:17.203
that a high school kid
wants to do.

22:17.236 --> 22:18.671
Unlike opening
a fashion boutique,

22:18.705 --> 22:20.206
which is super unique.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.559
I know I have a daughter.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.930
And I know
she deserves the best.

22:46.399 --> 22:47.834
But I don't think
I have to compromise

22:47.867 --> 22:50.269
what I want out of life
to do that.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.239
Especially if I think
it's gonna provide for her.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.277
You know me, Van.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.114
I can do this.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.555
I just gotta do it my way.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.562
And if you can't do this

23:15.595 --> 23:17.630
out of love for me...

23:20.232 --> 23:22.068
Do this out of love for her.

23:28.475 --> 23:31.077
That's some dumb shit.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.480
That's some dumb-ass shit,
Earn.

23:48.294 --> 23:51.130
(sighs)

23:51.163 --> 23:54.433
I'd like to report
a debit card stolen.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.434
Mm-hmm.

23:59.205 --> 24:02.575
Oh, champagne's the worst.

24:02.609 --> 24:06.479
(Migos "Spray the Champagne"
playing)

24:06.513 --> 24:09.448
* Oh, spray the champagne
spray the champagne *

24:09.482 --> 24:11.417
* Spray the champagne

24:11.450 --> 24:13.352
* Spray the champagne

24:13.385 --> 24:14.754

24:14.787 --> 24:16.288

24:16.322 --> 24:17.957

24:17.990 --> 24:19.959
* Young OG's

24:19.992 --> 24:22.428
* OG's

24:22.461 --> 24:25.331
* Uh, spray the champagne

24:25.364 --> 24:27.199
* Spray the champagne
spray the champagne *

24:27.233 --> 24:28.935
* Spray the champagne
spray the champagne *

24:28.968 --> 24:30.503
* Spray the champagne

24:30.537 --> 24:32.371
* Spraying champagne
on the sofa *

24:32.404 --> 24:33.706
* End of the couch
with Louboutin loafers *

24:33.740 --> 24:35.508
* 2,500
I put in the sole *

24:35.542 --> 24:37.276
* We got the crown and my,
this is golden *

24:37.309 --> 24:38.845
* Hocus pocus you know
that I be exposured *

24:38.878 --> 24:40.046
* And I be thanking God
everyday *

24:40.079 --> 24:41.948
* 'Cause it's chosen

24:41.981 --> 24:44.016
* So many gold chains
on my neck it turned gold *

24:44.050 --> 24:45.818
* I be whipping and driving the
Lamborghini like it's stolen *

24:45.852 --> 24:47.486
* Salute to the OG's
who gave us the crown *

24:47.520 --> 24:49.321
* Shout-out to the migo
said biting the style *

24:49.355 --> 24:51.223
* When I'm on stage
drippin' like it rain *

24:51.257 --> 24:53.359
* Sprayin' champagne
all over the damn crowd *

24:53.392 --> 24:55.227
* Ain't part of the squad
then don't come around *

24:55.261 --> 24:56.428
* Ain't a young rich
