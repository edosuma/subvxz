WEBVTT

00:30.144 --> 00:33.272
Kurouzu Town, my hometown.

00:34.282 --> 00:35.874
What I'm going to tell you

00:38.119 --> 00:41.885
is a strange story which
took place in this town.

01:26.367 --> 01:29.495
Vortex

01:53.961 --> 01:55.929
Lost again.

02:24.225 --> 02:25.419
Oh no!

03:18.312 --> 03:19.301
Jesus!

03:20.014 --> 03:21.345
Yamakuchi.

03:21.582 --> 03:22.446
Did I scare the hell out of you?

03:22.650 --> 03:23.617
Looks like you're scared

03:23.751 --> 03:24.740
You can't blame me!

03:24.919 --> 03:27.251
Are you mad? I like scaring people.

03:27.388 --> 03:30.414
I see. What a hobby!

03:32.894 --> 03:34.828
What?

03:35.730 --> 03:38.392
Kirie...will you be my girl?

03:42.103 --> 03:47.632
You scared me this time,
I'm in a rush.

03:50.044 --> 03:50.976
Kirie!

03:51.112 --> 03:54.377
I'm not joking, I really like you.

04:18.406 --> 04:21.101
Isn't that Shuichi's father?

04:39.560 --> 04:40.424
How are you?

04:51.072 --> 04:52.004
Oh.

05:36.884 --> 05:42.447
Here you are, I won today.

05:59.707 --> 06:05.202
The bike can only carry one
at a time!

06:08.049 --> 06:09.016
Huh?

07:24.325 --> 07:25.189
How are you?

07:26.260 --> 07:27.227
Welcome back.

07:29.330 --> 07:30.991
It's all tidied up.

07:31.265 --> 07:32.493
I really appreciate that.

07:36.003 --> 07:39.905
The sign is gone.

07:41.308 --> 07:43.276
Right, it's gone.

07:55.823 --> 08:00.726
Why do we have exams?

08:02.129 --> 08:04.996
It must be great to be
as smart as Shuichi.

08:06.066 --> 08:08.296
When I was in junior school,
as long as I attended class,

08:08.569 --> 08:10.332
I managed to do well in the exam
even without studying hard.

08:11.071 --> 08:13.301
That's not quite the case
after I went to high school.

08:13.707 --> 08:16.938
Especially with Maths,
it's an absolute puzzle.

08:17.578 --> 08:19.136
If Really gives me a mind block.

08:22.283 --> 08:23.147
Hey.

08:24.752 --> 08:26.151
Yeah...oh.

08:28.622 --> 08:31.250
Just now I saw your father
in the alley.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.794
He was filming snail shells
with a video cam.

08:38.332 --> 08:44.862
But it was kinda dark,
it might have been someone else.

08:46.173 --> 08:50.803
That's my father,
he's been acting a bit funny lately.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.338
No, it's all right.

09:07.161 --> 09:10.096
Shuichi, you're not quite yourself
lately.

09:11.398 --> 09:13.366
Overworked because of
the admission exam?

09:14.835 --> 09:17.099
Relax.

09:17.738 --> 09:22.903
You've always done well, you can
enter any university you like.

09:23.043 --> 09:23.907
Kirie,

09:25.379 --> 09:27.506
Do you want to run away with me?

09:27.648 --> 09:29.673
Run away?

09:31.418 --> 09:33.283
You shouldn't do things like that.

09:33.420 --> 09:39.290
There's priorities for everything ...

09:39.426 --> 09:48.164
Never mind, let's go home, okay?

09:49.136 --> 09:50.160
Shuichi.

10:14.161 --> 10:16.186
480 yen, thank you.

10:16.330 --> 10:17.194
Yes.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.192
Yes.

10:21.702 --> 10:22.464
Yes.

10:24.338 --> 10:27.171
20 yen, thank you.

10:27.308 --> 10:28.036
Right.

10:29.076 --> 10:32.409
I heard that your dad won
a special prize.

10:33.714 --> 10:35.477
Yes, isn't it great?

10:35.783 --> 10:40.243
We should now address your dad as
Master Gosima.

10:40.521 --> 10:42.284
Please don't say that.

10:42.823 --> 10:45.257
I've prepared a gift for you.

10:51.365 --> 10:52.696
Really?

10:53.100 --> 10:55.227
Yes, just as a celebration.

10:56.136 --> 10:57.194
Thank you very much.

11:14.455 --> 11:17.390
(its) Full of vigour.

11:18.258 --> 11:21.227
Mr. Gosima, didn't you
win a prize?

11:21.762 --> 11:26.461
It's just coinicidental.

11:28.268 --> 11:35.436
Pottery isn't really art.

11:36.410 --> 11:39.436
It would better be called
the art of vortex.

11:41.849 --> 11:44.875
Art of vortex?

11:52.559 --> 12:01.866
Like a vortex!
I always feel dizzy doing it!

12:05.072 --> 12:07.438
Impressive!

12:09.176 --> 12:22.283
Could you draw a pattern on that plate
and give it to me?

12:23.090 --> 12:25.923
A plate with a vortex pattren?

12:26.126 --> 12:35.057
Yes, a vortex,
round and round and round.

12:35.536 --> 12:37.561
Round and round and round?

12:38.172 --> 12:39.070
Yes.

12:40.474 --> 12:44.308
Okay, I'll try doing that.

12:46.847 --> 13:02.218
There's something mysterious
in the vortex.

13:02.629 --> 13:05.120
Something mysterious?

13:06.600 --> 13:09.592
Mr. Gosima should be able to understand

13:13.941 --> 13:19.971
a vortex is the highest form of art.

13:21.315 --> 13:27.982
And you're the artist of
this highest form of art.

14:09.096 --> 14:11.530
Your dessert.

14:16.970 --> 14:18.904
We're being luxurious today.

14:19.439 --> 14:23.000
It's from the fruit shop,
as a token to celebrate with.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.771
Really?

14:30.017 --> 14:33.544
It's all because of the lucky charm
that you gave me.

14:38.692 --> 14:40.922
It's all because of your work.

14:44.097 --> 14:46.361
Shuichi's father
was praising you too.

14:46.733 --> 14:48.564
Keep on with the good work.

14:49.436 --> 14:50.334
Right.

14:51.572 --> 14:52.630
Enjoy it.

14:54.308 --> 14:57.709
So you saw everything.

15:05.986 --> 15:07.578
This melon is really lovely.

15:08.388 --> 15:17.126
Yes? It's really good.

15:17.531 --> 15:18.691
Wonderful.

15:22.369 --> 15:23.199
Marvellous.

17:29.262 --> 17:32.390
You're my guardian angel.

17:37.938 --> 17:39.838
When Mom died ...

17:50.851 --> 17:52.819
Kirie, stop crying.

17:55.255 --> 17:56.745
Don't cry.

17:59.626 --> 18:03.255
I will be your mother.

18:06.767 --> 18:10.396
I don't want a boy to be my mother.

18:23.350 --> 18:26.683
Kirie, do you want to run away with me?

18:29.456 --> 18:31.356
Run away.

18:34.361 --> 18:37.296
Shuichi, I'm waiting.

19:09.296 --> 19:11.457
Good morning.

19:22.409 --> 19:23.205
Good morning.

19:23.577 --> 19:24.407
Good morning.

19:33.053 --> 19:36.955
Does Shuichi want to sit the
exam for the University of Tokyo?

19:37.891 --> 19:41.793
Why?

19:42.729 --> 19:44.458
I guess so.

19:44.965 --> 19:48.833
Haven't you discussed it with him?
That's important.

19:49.703 --> 19:50.761
No.

19:51.071 --> 19:53.562
That's not right.

19:54.007 --> 19:55.497
Are you two dating now?

19:56.376 --> 19:59.243
Not really dating.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.048
If you go on with
this wouldn't-care-less manner...

20:03.283 --> 20:03.977
Did I scare the hell out of you?

20:05.285 --> 20:11.884
You're hopeless with Kirie,
she already has a boyfriend.

20:14.394 --> 20:16.055
I know, Shuichi Saitou.

20:16.596 --> 20:20.657
I really want you to be
my girlfirend...

20:20.800 --> 20:22.267
to be envied by the others.

20:23.670 --> 20:26.571
Idiot, you're really pathetic.

20:26.706 --> 20:28.469
Wait.

20:28.909 --> 20:30.570
Stop bugging us.

20:32.546 --> 20:33.535
Kirie.

20:39.352 --> 20:41.752
Kirie, that nerd is staring at us.

20:43.423 --> 20:45.050
I was "ambushed" by him yesterday.

20:45.392 --> 20:46.290
"Ambushed"?

20:46.993 --> 20:48.824
You must be careful.

20:49.062 --> 20:52.554
A girl from another class
was stalked by him.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.458
Really?

20:55.769 --> 20:59.034
Because that guy is ...

21:00.840 --> 21:01.932
What?

21:04.010 --> 21:05.307
Love crazed.

21:06.813 --> 21:08.110
X rate contact?

21:41.114 --> 21:42.843
Are you all right? Kirie.

21:44.184 --> 21:48.120
I'm fine, thanks.

21:49.089 --> 21:56.018
But it's awful to see
that kind of thing.

21:56.563 --> 22:00.659
Was he trying to perform ...

22:01.568 --> 22:07.700
stunts on the staircase?

22:20.220 --> 22:22.051
He's lucky.

22:22.956 --> 22:23.854
Sekino.

22:36.636 --> 22:42.541
Isn't it lucky to be
the centre of focus?

22:45.078 --> 22:48.946
Life is meaningless if
no one pays attention to you.

22:49.916 --> 22:52.578
It's such pleasure to be watched.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.717
Don't you think so?

22:56.956 --> 22:59.083
I don't like attention.

22:59.225 --> 23:01.216
Besides, he's dead already.

23:03.997 --> 23:06.659
He can't draw attention
without being dead.

23:08.568 --> 23:13.028
I love drawing others' attention,
especially lately.

23:15.108 --> 23:18.441
To be honest,
I want to be the focus.

23:25.285 --> 23:28.220
That's a spiral staircase.

23:28.822 --> 23:30.050
How do you know?

23:30.523 --> 23:31.581
A vortex.

23:31.891 --> 23:33.518
Vortex?

23:46.005 --> 23:47.632
What about the vortex?

23:56.216 --> 24:00.050
Vortex patterns have a puzzling power.

24:00.520 --> 24:05.219
Those attracted want to
attract others as well.

24:05.792 --> 24:09.819
That guy must have been attracted
by the vortex.

24:11.731 --> 24:15.758
No, I think it's just coincidental.

24:20.306 --> 24:23.605
I have a bad feeling about this town.

24:24.711 --> 24:27.839
Going through that tunnel
always makes me dizzy.

24:28.915 --> 24:31.315
This town is already cursed.

24:34.154 --> 24:37.521
But I don't have
any strange feeling.

24:56.142 --> 25:00.238
Didn't my father visit
your place yesterday?

25:03.316 --> 25:07.047
He wanted my dad to make a plate
with vortex pattern.

25:07.220 --> 25:10.348
Praised by your father,
Dad was vigorous and high-spirited.

25:10.723 --> 25:12.054
So it's the vortex.

25:14.394 --> 25:16.021
You're being imaginative.

25:16.396 --> 25:18.990
A vortex pattern
is nothing extraordinary.

25:19.132 --> 25:21.259
You're saying that because
you don't understand.

25:24.370 --> 25:25.302
sorry.

25:28.708 --> 25:30.801
My father is so obsessed that
you could call it sick.

25:32.612 --> 25:36.309
He doesn't go to work anymore,

25:36.916 --> 25:40.044
he spends his time collecting things
in the shape of vortexes.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.021
He just stares at
all these vortexes.

25:44.224 --> 25:46.385
He won't answer you no matter
how hard you call him,

25:47.193 --> 25:51.061
he just looks at the vortexes.

25:53.066 --> 25:54.397
Last night,

25:59.739 --> 26:01.070
Father was ill.

26:03.376 --> 26:05.310
Mom, you can't go on like this.

26:08.248 --> 26:09.806
He'd better go to the hospital.

27:36.469 --> 27:38.198
You must have had a long day today.

28:28.588 --> 28:31.785
Let me have some more Narumon Roll,
please?

28:32.458 --> 28:33.891
That's all we have.

28:34.794 --> 28:36.921
What? That's all?

28:38.097 --> 28:39.121
I'm sorry.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.960
You don't have to apologize.

28:42.368 --> 28:45.565
How can you have miso soup without
Narumon Roll?

29:20.406 --> 29:23.068
Father seemed to be satisfied
by that.

29:24.310 --> 29:25.436
It's not funny.

29:26.512 --> 29:27.536
But ...

29:35.555 --> 29:37.147
Want to come to my place now?

29:38.624 --> 29:40.023
When you see it, you'll understand.

29:44.964 --> 29:49.264
Idiot.

30:24.937 --> 30:26.336
What are you doing?

30:27.173 --> 30:28.197
How dare you!

30:28.341 --> 30:29.501
Please don't!

30:30.309 --> 30:32.106
Father, what happened?

30:32.512 --> 30:36.039
She threw away all my
favourite collections.

30:36.215 --> 30:37.147
I threw them away.

30:38.451 --> 30:40.282
They should be.

30:41.354 --> 30:44.346
What do you mean? What do you know?

30:44.490 --> 30:50.622
Please go back to the old you.
Please wake up.

30:53.699 --> 30:57.658
Too bad, they're all thrown away!

30:58.371 --> 31:02.603
A vortex is not only about
a material being.

31:02.942 --> 31:05.467
I finally came to realize
this philospohy.

31:06.279 --> 31:09.305
A vortex can be created.

31:09.582 --> 31:12.176
Remember,

31:13.586 --> 31:16.919
a vortex can be expressed by our bodies.

31:17.990 --> 31:21.357
Like this.

32:12.478 --> 32:15.072
What happened? You look terrible.

32:17.450 --> 32:19.645
Haven't you seen Shuichi lately?

32:22.622 --> 32:23.987
You guys been fighting?

32:26.459 --> 32:27.448
He has someone else?

32:31.130 --> 32:32.188
You're dumped?

32:34.700 --> 32:36.190
Come on, tell me what happened.

32:36.335 --> 32:37.063
Ishikawa.

32:37.136 --> 32:38.068
Yes ...

32:39.372 --> 32:41.135
You don't care if you fail again?

32:58.190 --> 32:59.350
Mr. Katayama,

33:00.259 --> 33:01.817
which class do you think
you're having?

33:03.796 --> 33:13.364
Sorry, I did leave home on time.

33:14.840 --> 33:15.829
Sir,

33:16.542 --> 33:19.033
that guy walks terribly slowly.

33:19.845 --> 33:22.609
Worse than a snail.

33:24.116 --> 33:24.741
Tsumura.

33:25.451 --> 33:26.577
Snail...

33:26.719 --> 33:28.414
Sir, you are fat...

33:28.554 --> 33:31.546
Stop singing.

33:38.731 --> 33:46.831
Why do you come to school
only when it rains?

33:48.341 --> 33:54.644
Come to the teachers' room
after school.

33:54.714 --> 33:57.649
It'll take him two years to go to
the teachers' room.

33:57.783 --> 33:59.444
Wouldn't we all have graduated
by then?

34:02.521 --> 34:04.512
Anyway, sit down.

34:15.868 --> 34:20.567
I'm not siding with Tsumura,
but Katayama is really slow.

34:20.706 --> 34:21.502
Ishikawa.

34:21.639 --> 34:22.504
Yes ...

34:24.143 --> 34:26.134
I didn't ask you to sit down.

34:50.469 --> 34:52.130
Disgusting.

34:55.775 --> 34:59.734
It makes me sick to see you, fatso!

35:00.846 --> 35:04.145
Go to hell, you make me mad.

35:05.351 --> 35:06.875
I'm upset.

35:16.495 --> 35:17.757
Stop it.

35:17.897 --> 35:23.392
Oyama, Tsumura,
go back to your seats.

36:13.786 --> 36:19.281
It's all right.

36:45.551 --> 36:46.518
Did I scare the hell out of you?

36:50.022 --> 36:51.683
Excuse me.

36:55.394 --> 36:56.884
Would you open it?

36:57.329 --> 36:58.387
I can't accept.

36:59.832 --> 37:04.963
Just open it, would you?

37:24.023 --> 37:25.422
Happy?

37:25.791 --> 37:26.849
Don't do this again.

37:28.928 --> 37:30.589
Why do you hate me so much?

37:31.764 --> 37:36.667
I don't like your so-called hobby.

37:43.142 --> 37:47.101
Kirie, I won't give up.

37:47.947 --> 37:51.041
You will change your feelings
towards me.

38:56.982 --> 38:59.041
Dad, I'm home.

38:59.184 --> 39:00.583
Welcome back.

39:00.719 --> 39:02.448
I'll prepare dinner now.

39:02.588 --> 39:03.555
Kirie.

39:04.623 --> 39:09.651
Could you take this plate to
Shuichi's father?

39:11.230 --> 39:12.788
Any problem?

39:15.701 --> 39:18.135
If he doesn't like it,
I can do it again.

41:12.951 --> 41:14.316
Hello?

41:24.363 --> 41:25.295
Shuichi?

41:47.052 --> 41:49.282
Shuichi, are you there? Shuichi.

42:01.033 --> 42:02.364
Shuichi?

42:14.646 --> 42:24.612
Where are you? Shuichi ...

43:19.411 --> 43:20.378
It's Kirie.

43:29.354 --> 43:30.150
Kirie.

43:33.125 --> 43:34.319
What happened? Kirie.

43:35.294 --> 43:36.886
Kirie, what happened?

44:04.156 --> 44:04.986
Vortex.

44:45.530 --> 44:47.521
Do we know the cause of death?

44:49.434 --> 44:50.924
Wasn't it a heart attack?

44:51.570 --> 44:53.504
I heard it was suicide.

44:54.339 --> 44:57.968
Even the families don't know why.

44:59.111 --> 45:02.740
No autopsy?

45:03.448 --> 45:06.440
So what exactly caused him to die?

45:09.054 --> 45:10.214
Thank you.

45:19.064 --> 45:21.498
Are you all right?
You don't look well.

45:23.068 --> 45:24.763
Neither do you.

45:27.105 --> 45:29.903
It doesn't come as a surprise to me.

45:31.209 --> 45:33.200
I worry more about Mom.

45:35.514 --> 45:37.277
Although she said nothing,

45:37.816 --> 45:41.081
we've plan to leave this town
after the week of mourning.

45:42.454 --> 45:44.547
Madam, what happened?

45:47.359 --> 45:48.417
What's that?

45:48.994 --> 45:52.953
Won't you please stop?
Don't go so far.

45:53.098 --> 45:54.360
Mom, what is it?

45:56.034 --> 45:57.296
Shuichi!

45:57.436 --> 45:59.165
Mom, calm down, what happened?

45:59.304 --> 46:02.569
Shuichi, that! It's Father!

46:12.017 --> 46:13.416
Mom!

46:13.552 --> 46:16.385
Hey...call an ambulance.

46:17.289 --> 46:18.551
Mom.

46:42.614 --> 46:43.512
Dragonfly Pond.

47:05.604 --> 47:06.662
Cheer up!

47:07.506 --> 47:08.131
Kirie.

47:09.407 --> 47:11.568
Leave this town as soon as you can.

47:14.946 --> 47:24.582
It's under the curse of the vortex.

47:24.723 --> 47:26.213
What about your mother?

47:26.725 --> 47:29.091
She needs a few days to get over it.

47:34.633 --> 47:37.397
Are you Shuichi Saitou?

47:39.037 --> 47:41.369
Ichirou Tamura, Local News Section,
Midoriyama Newspaper.

47:41.506 --> 47:44.100
What happened is really ...

47:44.409 --> 47:47.173
Do you know about my father?

47:50.682 --> 47:56.484
A few weeks ago,
your father went to our office.

47:58.623 --> 48:04.289
Said he'd like to know about
the history of this town.

48:05.597 --> 48:08.464
I showed him some articles.

48:09.100 --> 48:11.933
Anything peculiar
in the way he acted?

48:12.571 --> 48:13.629
You don't mind?

48:21.213 --> 48:27.550
It's all about the vortex.

48:32.691 --> 48:34.955
I've asked the police

48:35.427 --> 48:37.088
about the cause of death.

48:37.562 --> 48:39.393
What I really want to find out is

48:39.598 --> 48:42.692
why did he kill himself in that way?

48:43.001 --> 48:51.204
I feel that your father's death
has a profound meaning.

48:51.576 --> 48:58.573
Together with the smoke
in the crematorium,

48:59.618 --> 49:06.649
there seems to be
some special association.

49:09.561 --> 49:11.654
I hope you can trust me.

49:26.778 --> 49:27.767
Back then ...

49:28.146 --> 49:29.738
A tape that my father made.

49:36.288 --> 49:38.722
It was rewound when he died.

50:31.109 --> 50:32.838
Wait a minute, play it again.

50:52.263 --> 50:53.127
Mirror?

50:54.866 --> 50:56.595
That's my mom's pocket mirror.

50:58.536 --> 51:03.235
Why did he take out the mirror?
Besides ...

51:06.644 --> 51:09.238
Let me keep the tape.

51:09.914 --> 51:12.314
I'll let you know as soon as
I get anything.

51:19.491 --> 51:21.891
You're always with Shuichi?

51:23.828 --> 51:27.855
Yes, we've been friends all our life.

51:29.300 --> 51:35.864
Wonderful, life-long friendship.

51:42.814 --> 51:48.548
He helps me all the time.

51:50.188 --> 51:53.851
He brightens up my days.

51:54.826 --> 52:03.859
However,

52:09.407 --> 52:19.806
I can't do anything for Shuichi.

52:22.287 --> 52:29.989
He has to deal with the situation
himself ...

52:33.832 --> 52:47.200
You're a great support to him.

52:51.983 --> 52:53.245
Support ...

52:56.788 --> 53:03.557
Have confidence, don't give up.

53:09.801 --> 53:10.665
Yes.

53:14.305 --> 53:16.466
Let me know when it gets near
where you live.

53:23.982 --> 53:27.247
Take the next right turn.

53:28.953 --> 53:31.046
Right turn.

53:39.664 --> 53:40.460
Watch out!

53:43.301 --> 53:44.359
Dad!

53:46.004 --> 53:47.062
Are you all right?

53:50.408 --> 53:51.375
I'm fine.

53:53.111 --> 53:55.579
What happened? You're all muddy.

53:58.750 --> 54:02.015
I've brought back some mud
from the pond.

54:16.968 --> 54:17.935
Dad.

58:07.265 --> 58:08.232
Dad.

58:09.367 --> 58:10.766
You'll catch cold!

58:10.935 --> 58:14.200
Don't come over, go to bed now!

58:14.338 --> 58:15.134
But ...

58:15.273 --> 58:17.639
Don't worry, I'm okay, go to bed.

58:37.662 --> 58:38.287
Yes.

58:43.835 --> 58:44.859
Yes, okay.

58:48.406 --> 58:49.270
Kirie ...

58:49.407 --> 58:51.739
Have you studied for
the Biology Test tomorrow?

58:52.610 --> 58:54.601
You haven't forgotten, have you?

59:06.624 --> 59:09.115
Okay, next.

59:09.360 --> 59:14.764
Kirie, you seem to be
quite distracted lately.

59:19.937 --> 59:22.371
Hey, look.

59:23.908 --> 59:27.969
Sekino's hair is all set and curly
even in the morning.

59:34.819 --> 59:35.581
Yes.

59:48.065 --> 59:49.225
Impressive.

59:50.434 --> 59:52.425
Good for you, Sekino.

01:00:08.953 --> 01:00:12.218
You'll get tired easily,
if you drink so much water.

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:13.015
Oyama.

01:00:13.224 --> 01:00:13.952
Yes.

01:02:03.834 --> 01:02:04.562
Mirror, body of a snake ... snake.

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.355
These are all for your mother ...

01:03:04.862 --> 01:03:06.489
She likes sweets.

01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:07.528
Thank you.

01:03:19.343 --> 01:03:22.005
My mom can't eat this.

01:03:25.483 --> 01:03:26.381
Sorry.

01:03:27.618 --> 01:03:28.380
My mom ...

01:03:28.519 --> 01:03:29.281
will think of Father when she sees
things shaped like vortexes.

01:03:33.624 --> 01:03:35.023
I'm sorry.

01:03:36.227 --> 01:03:38.457
The hair or the fingerprints
is also in the shape of a vortex.

01:03:38.596 --> 01:03:40.621
So don't let Mom see it.

01:03:42.666 --> 01:03:43.462
You want it?

01:04:00.584 --> 01:04:02.313
Sorry to have you dressed like this.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.120
I've told the hospital to pay
attention to vortex-shaped things.

01:04:05.623 --> 01:04:08.023
Mom is paying attention to
vortex-shaped things on her body.

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.890
She's afriad of vortexes?

01:04:11.962 --> 01:04:13.259
By getting rid of the vortex,

01:04:13.664 --> 01:04:17.361
I hope she can be cured
of her vortex phobia.

01:04:44.728 --> 01:04:45.387
Mom.

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:49.299
Kirie.

01:04:53.671 --> 01:05:03.205
Mr. Saitou, please go to the reception
if you're in the hospital premises.

01:05:07.685 --> 01:05:08.310
Excuse me.

01:05:08.452 --> 01:05:09.077
Yes.

01:05:09.153 --> 01:05:10.984
I'm Shuichi Saitou.

01:05:11.121 --> 01:05:14.648
Mr. Tamura called, said that
he'd like to contact you.

01:05:14.792 --> 01:05:16.225
Thank you.

01:05:38.148 --> 01:05:40.139
This is Shuichi.

01:05:41.018 --> 01:05:46.979
I've found some important points.

01:05:48.058 --> 01:05:50.549
I'm going to Dragonfly Pond now.

01:05:51.028 --> 01:05:52.120
Mind if I join you?

01:05:52.596 --> 01:05:53.688
I'm on my way.

01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:14.176
Another one here ...

01:06:21.592 --> 01:06:23.082
Shuichi, what are you doing?

01:06:24.161 --> 01:06:30.327
If Mom sees this vortex,
the result will be disastrous.

01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:53.847
Mr. Tamura might have
discovered something.

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:09.435
So it's because of this guy ...

01:07:09.573 --> 01:07:11.666
you treat me like dirt.

01:07:11.842 --> 01:07:13.332
Kirie, who is he?

01:07:13.477 --> 01:07:18.608
If you've already chosen him,
I can give up.

01:07:18.749 --> 01:07:20.114
We're leaving, get lost.

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:29.318
Damn it, Kirie,
to make you remember me always ...

01:07:33.497 --> 01:07:34.156
Yamakuchi!

01:07:34.932 --> 01:07:35.864
Kirie!

01:08:21.545 --> 01:08:22.341
Kirie.

01:08:24.848 --> 01:08:27.282
We used to play here all the time.

01:08:32.656 --> 01:08:34.886
Kirie was very timid.

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.455
I told you there's a gigantic snake
in the pond ...

01:08:38.595 --> 01:08:41.758
girls who came here were eaten.

01:08:41.965 --> 01:08:43.865
You were scared to tears.

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:51.205
Shuichi, you didn't know what to do.

01:08:52.242 --> 01:08:56.975
You said you'd protect me,

01:09:03.953 --> 01:09:16.229
as if things would turn out
the way you wanted them.

01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:21.430
If this is not a dream,
people are really dying.

01:09:22.639 --> 01:09:26.336
This town is cursed by a vortex.

01:09:29.846 --> 01:09:30.745
Kirie.

01:09:41.024 --> 01:09:49.932
Shuichi, I'm ... I'm so scared.

01:09:56.974 --> 01:09:58.965
I'll protect you.

01:10:01.912 --> 01:10:02.879
Shuichi.

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:35.219
Yukie...Yukie.

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:43.031
In fact, there's still a vortex
in your body.

01:13:46.503 --> 01:13:50.234
In the deepest part of your ear.

01:13:51.308 --> 01:13:56.871
It wants to turn into vortex
and be asleep in your ear.

01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.511
Don't.

01:13:58.715 --> 01:14:05.678
There's still a vortex in
the deepest part of your ear.

01:14:07.958 --> 01:14:12.986
There's still a vortex in your ear.

01:14:14.798 --> 01:14:18.495
Vortex.

01:14:22.205 --> 01:14:23.672
Don't.

01:14:40.724 --> 01:14:43.215
Vortex again.

01:14:44.327 --> 01:14:51.756
People in this town become
black vortexes when they die.

01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:59.937
Can you see the face?

01:15:04.314 --> 01:15:06.305
Oh God, yes you can.

01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:08.818
That's it, look.

01:15:15.325 --> 01:15:16.314
Mom.

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:03.663
This is the latest update
on the typhoon.

01:17:08.004 --> 01:17:10.666
Due to unknown reasons, this
year's climate has been abnormal.

01:17:10.807 --> 01:17:13.071
There has been no typhoon.

01:17:13.343 --> 01:17:14.401
Until now.

01:17:14.711 --> 01:17:16.736
We finally have our first typhoon.

01:17:17.447 --> 01:17:21.383
Typhoon No. 1 has landed in Japan,

01:17:21.518 --> 01:17:24.453
With an hourly speed of 6 to 9 km...

01:17:27.958 --> 01:17:30.392
"Bizarre, the Horror of Kurouzu Town"

01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:33.429
Hello, I'm Chie Maruyama.

01:17:33.964 --> 01:17:37.866
I'm in Kurouzu Town which is now
being approached by the typhoon.

01:17:38.134 --> 01:17:40.830
Recently, many bizarre incidents
have occurred here.

01:17:41.338 --> 01:17:42.464
First of all,

01:17:42.839 --> 01:17:48.835
a gigantic snail the size
of a person was found.

01:17:49.479 --> 01:17:52.812
"Bizarre! Gigantic snails"

01:17:55.418 --> 01:17:56.749
Wait a minute!

01:17:59.556 --> 01:18:01.990
What's that? How cute!

01:18:02.192 --> 01:18:04.490
It was shot by a student.

01:18:10.834 --> 01:18:15.737
It seems to be Katayama
who's in the same grade as me.

01:18:15.939 --> 01:18:20.433
A vortex pattern has appeared
on his back.

01:18:20.577 --> 01:18:24.343
He only goes to school
on rainy days.

01:18:24.481 --> 01:18:27.917
That must be Tsumura,
they're both photogenic.

01:18:28.051 --> 01:18:30.246
Just the thought of him
makes one happy.

01:18:30.387 --> 01:18:33.879
It must be Tsumura,
gobbling water like this.

01:18:34.391 --> 01:18:36.359
He's getting slower and slower,
just like Katayama.

01:18:36.493 --> 01:18:38.552
Although my father runs
a fruit and vegetable shop,

01:18:38.862 --> 01:18:40.762
he saw "Hitomaimai"
on the trail to the hill.

01:18:42.499 --> 01:18:45.935
The gigantic snails are actually
human beings.

01:18:46.069 --> 01:18:50.438
The two so-called "Hitomaimai"s

01:18:50.573 --> 01:18:55.203
are going in the direction
of the hill.

01:18:55.812 --> 01:19:00.442
Teenagers in this town are trying
their best to search for them,

01:19:01.918 --> 01:19:06.548
but the bizarre stories of
Kurouzu Town do not end here.

01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:15.388
Beautiful.

01:19:17.467 --> 01:19:24.100
All the incidents have
one thing in common : vortexes.

01:19:28.211 --> 01:19:32.944
This town is finished.

01:19:35.952 --> 01:19:37.283
Let me get Dad.

01:19:38.555 --> 01:19:39.544
Kirie!

01:19:41.524 --> 01:19:42.616
I'll go with you.

01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:52.226
How much longer will it take?

01:19:53.403 --> 01:19:54.495
We're almost there,
the tunnel is just up ahead.

01:19:57.207 --> 01:19:58.299
Great, next time let's get
a better car.

01:20:08.451 --> 01:20:09.543
That's weird, I can't find the exit.

01:20:18.094 --> 01:20:19.186
A vortex.

01:20:25.668 --> 01:20:29.195
Just now he was here.

01:20:30.473 --> 01:20:32.134
Is he at Tsuyomi's place?

01:20:34.077 --> 01:20:35.476
Dad?

01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:49.622
Where is he?

01:21:12.982 --> 01:21:13.914
Dad.

01:21:19.689 --> 01:21:21.714
What happened? Shuichi.

01:21:44.681 --> 01:21:49.550
Kirie...l'm also surrounded
by a vortex.

01:21:53.056 --> 01:21:54.114
Don't come over.

01:21:58.761 --> 01:22:03.630
Run, I'm done.

01:22:05.201 --> 01:22:10.730
No, we said we'd run together.

01:22:11.474 --> 01:22:13.704
Kirie ...

01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:17.707
Sorry, I can't protect you anymore.

01:22:19.015 --> 01:22:21.779
Don't say that, hold on.

01:22:23.019 --> 01:22:28.548
Kirie, I like you very much.

01:22:32.395 --> 01:22:40.769
Shuichi?

01:22:54.050 --> 01:23:00.080
Don't, didn't we have a deal?

01:23:07.463 --> 01:23:13.766
Didn't you say you'd protect me?

01:23:19.842 --> 01:23:27.806
Don't die.

01:23:43.099 --> 01:23:45.795
Be a vortex too.

01:23:58.781 --> 01:24:01.545
Be a vortex too.

01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:30.676
Kirie.

01:27:36.399 --> 01:27:39.425
Kurouzu Town, my hometown.

01:27:40.469 --> 01:27:42.460
What I'm going to tell you ...
