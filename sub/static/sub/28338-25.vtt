08:47.040 --> 08:50.500
Um... Oh. Yeah, okay.
Well, that's fine.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.210
We can pick a place together.

08:52.210 --> 08:56.040
No, I really don't know
where to go or what to do.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.880
-[Petey groaning]
-Star!

08:57.880 --> 09:00.040
You're acting
like you don't want to go.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.420
You do want to go,
don't you?

09:02.420 --> 09:03.540
I think...

09:05.920 --> 09:08.330
I'm really excited
to not be a princess,

09:08.330 --> 09:10.380
and now that Mewni
doesn't need me,

09:10.380 --> 09:12.750
now that I'm free,

09:14.670 --> 09:18.250
I think I need time
to figure things out.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.500
But I--

09:20.500 --> 09:22.120
Ohh!

09:22.120 --> 09:24.000
Oh! I wish you woulda
told me this sooner!

09:24.000 --> 09:25.750
Oh, Tom, please.

09:25.750 --> 09:27.000
Don't be upset.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.620
No! Not upset!

09:28.620 --> 09:30.920
I don't wanna
pressure you or anything!

09:30.920 --> 09:33.380
Oh, you are upset!
I can tell!

09:33.380 --> 09:36.330
Okay, okay, I'm upset,
but I'm allowed to be!

09:36.330 --> 09:39.170
Just like you're allowed
to be, uh, you know--

09:39.170 --> 09:41.710
Ohh!

09:41.710 --> 09:43.790
Look, you should
take your time.

09:43.790 --> 09:46.670
If you want to.
If you need to.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.080
You don't have to go.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.670
Oh, I'm gonna go.

09:50.670 --> 09:52.040
I don't know where,
but you know what?

09:52.040 --> 09:53.920
It's gonna be great.

09:55.330 --> 09:57.920
[whinnying]

09:59.790 --> 10:01.170
I'll leave my phone on.

10:01.170 --> 10:03.540
Let me know when
you've figured it out, okay?

10:03.540 --> 10:05.040
Okay.

10:06.330 --> 10:07.830
[whinnying]

10:07.830 --> 10:09.880
Master! Don't forget
your bags!

10:12.830 --> 10:14.000
Shhhh!

10:21.710 --> 10:23.040
[deep breath]

10:23.040 --> 10:24.500
Oh, Tom.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.830
[doorbell rings]

10:29.460 --> 10:32.080
[gasp]
Star! Star Butterfly!

10:32.080 --> 10:34.670
-Ooh!
-Look who came to visit!

10:34.670 --> 10:36.500
Star?! You're... here?!

10:36.500 --> 10:37.880
You're here!

10:37.880 --> 10:39.290
-Uh-huh.
-Awesome! Hey!

10:39.290 --> 10:40.540
Close your eyes
for a second!

10:40.540 --> 10:41.920
-Got 'em!
-[laughs] Okay.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.170
What's going on?

10:43.170 --> 10:47.580
Star, meet Mariposa,
my new baby sister.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.080
[gasp] Sister?!

10:49.080 --> 10:50.920
I thought you
were getting a brother!

10:50.920 --> 10:52.580
For how much money
these doctors charge,

10:52.580 --> 10:55.580
you'd think they
would be much better
at their jobs.

11:03.170 --> 11:05.250
It's so good to see you.

11:05.250 --> 11:08.210
Yeah. It's--
It's good to be back.
