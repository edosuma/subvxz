01:41.051 --> 01:42.968
Okay, here we go.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.848
Two truths, one lie.

01:45.850 --> 01:47.736
I love your obsession
with this game.

01:47.738 --> 01:50.391
Okay. One, there is a huge
wine cellar in the basement,

01:50.393 --> 01:52.728
and we have total access.

01:52.730 --> 01:54.360
- Well, that's impossible.
- Mm-hmm.

01:54.362 --> 01:56.600
Okay, um, two,

01:56.602 --> 01:58.328
the hot tub is
currently out of service.

01:58.330 --> 02:00.248
- It's very sad for us.
- Mm-hmm.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.671
Um, three,
the house does have Wi-Fi,

02:03.673 --> 02:05.656
so you can answer
your damn work emails.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.159
Hmm, let me think.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.847
Well, the lie
is obviously number one.

02:09.848 --> 02:11.415
No one would be crazy enough

02:11.417 --> 02:13.848
to give us access
to their wine cellar.

02:13.850 --> 02:17.240
I'm very sorry, Mr. Palmer,
but that is incorrect.

02:18.393 --> 02:20.664
The house
doesn't have a hot tub,

02:20.666 --> 02:22.584
just, like, an incredible pool.

02:22.586 --> 02:25.367
Oh, wait. So the wine cellar
thing is real?

02:25.369 --> 02:26.969
Better than your hotel?

02:45.113 --> 02:46.167
Is this it?

02:46.169 --> 02:48.311
I-I don't know. Um...

02:48.313 --> 02:50.647
Hey, are you sure
that this is the right place?

02:50.649 --> 02:51.672
Because this...

02:53.049 --> 02:54.873
Oh, thank God.

02:56.185 --> 02:57.623
You were about to be

02:57.625 --> 03:00.438
wildly optimistic
about that place.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.782
Weren't you? Yes.

03:01.784 --> 03:04.214
- Mmm! Yes, you were.
- It was... It was funky!

03:04.216 --> 03:06.391
- It was like... It had character.
- Ah, you are so cute!

03:06.393 --> 03:07.446
- Yeah, it was so...
- Rustic.

03:07.448 --> 03:10.136
Yeah, so, so rustic.

03:15.065 --> 03:16.823
Hey, is this it?

03:16.825 --> 03:19.926
I think this is the place.

03:19.928 --> 03:21.622
No way.

03:21.624 --> 03:23.000
Yeah. Yeah, this is it.

03:38.808 --> 03:40.181
- What?
- Oh, my...

03:40.183 --> 03:42.455
It's even bigger
than the picture.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.727
You turn... Okay.

03:56.343 --> 03:57.336
So cool.

04:03.127 --> 04:05.783
Oh, look at this place.

04:08.023 --> 04:09.396
Amazing.

04:09.398 --> 04:12.373
- Holy shit!
- It's amazing.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.653
Are you serious?

04:13.655 --> 04:16.245
Bet I can see it all first!

04:16.247 --> 04:19.285
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

04:19.286 --> 04:20.469
Ah, the kitchen!

04:20.471 --> 04:22.197
Ah, this place is amazing.

04:22.199 --> 04:23.765
What?

04:23.767 --> 04:25.781
It's gorgeous.
It's so gorgeous.

04:25.783 --> 04:27.381
"Welcome home.

04:27.383 --> 04:31.605
"Please treat this house
as yours for the next six days

04:31.607 --> 04:35.636
"while you have all the privacy
you could ever want.

04:35.638 --> 04:41.107
I am only a town over should you
need anything at all. Eduardo."

04:41.109 --> 04:42.613
Treat this house
as ours, huh?

04:42.615 --> 04:45.620
And little does he know
how we treat our house.

04:45.622 --> 04:48.340
We kind of have an abusive
relationship with our house.

04:48.342 --> 04:50.101
What are you saying?

04:50.103 --> 04:51.604
You saying I did good?

04:51.606 --> 04:54.166
Wow, you did so good.

04:55.222 --> 04:56.467
- Shit!
- Oh!

04:56.469 --> 04:58.707
Oh, my God.

04:58.709 --> 05:00.597
Ah, I'm gross right now, anyway.

05:00.599 --> 05:01.812
No, I love gross.

05:01.814 --> 05:05.684
No, I'm, like, really gross.
I stink.

05:05.686 --> 05:08.115
And, um, you should stink,

05:08.117 --> 05:10.516
but all I can smell
is your delicious cologne.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.853
Love how this
always works on you.

05:57.460 --> 06:00.021
Interesting range, Eduardo.

06:27.667 --> 06:28.754
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

06:28.756 --> 06:29.938
- We made it.
- We made it.

06:29.940 --> 06:31.442
- We are here.
- I mean,

06:31.444 --> 06:32.820
it's almost as good
as Martha's Vineyard.

06:33.843 --> 06:35.281
What is up with you

06:35.283 --> 06:37.233
and your obsession
with Martha's Vineyard?

06:37.235 --> 06:39.506
I... I mean,
you loved Martha's Vineyard.

06:39.508 --> 06:42.162
No. This is so much better.
Are you kidding?

06:42.164 --> 06:45.169
Mmm. You're calling that
already, huh?

06:45.171 --> 06:48.914
Absolutely.
I mean, look at this.

06:49.940 --> 06:52.657
Listen to it.

06:52.659 --> 06:55.537
It's like we're the only
two people in the world.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.402
Oh, my God.

07:00.404 --> 07:03.091
It's just us. So...

07:04.595 --> 07:09.872
Why don't we put those away,
lock them away?

07:09.874 --> 07:13.810
No... No more emails, texts...

07:14.770 --> 07:15.857
Instagram.

07:15.859 --> 07:17.616
Oh, really?

07:17.618 --> 07:19.057
You're not gonna be
on Instagram all week?

07:19.059 --> 07:21.041
I don't need Instagram
when I'm with you.

07:21.043 --> 07:23.377
- Oh, you don't need Instagram?
- No.

07:23.379 --> 07:25.905
I mean, I don't know what we
could just do, the two of us

07:25.907 --> 07:30.160
without any interactions
all the way out here.

07:30.162 --> 07:32.464
What could we do out here?

07:32.466 --> 07:34.576
I don't know.
I have a few ideas, though.

07:34.578 --> 07:36.784
- You do?
- Hmm, yeah.

07:36.786 --> 07:38.959
- Like what?
- I don't know, honey.

07:38.961 --> 07:42.960
Go put our phones away,
and I'll... I'll show you.

07:42.962 --> 07:43.920
You'll show me?

07:45.458 --> 07:46.736
Mine's upstairs!

07:46.738 --> 07:48.016
Yeah.

08:32.818 --> 08:34.799
Look at you
in all those clothes.

08:56.624 --> 08:57.744
What's wrong?

09:04.560 --> 09:06.128
I love you...

09:07.088 --> 09:09.264
so, so, so much.

09:10.512 --> 09:11.790
Yeah?

09:11.792 --> 09:12.976
Yeah.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.272
What's wrong?

09:37.936 --> 09:41.615
Sorry. I just can't
with those things watching us.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.663
Stupid.

10:09.615 --> 10:10.767
Hey...

10:13.359 --> 10:15.215
we came here
to fix this, right?

10:16.398 --> 10:18.639
We're not gonna leave
until we do.

10:21.999 --> 10:23.948
Right. Uh...

10:23.950 --> 10:26.732
two truths, one lie. You ready?

10:26.734 --> 10:29.676
No. I'm sleeping.

10:29.678 --> 10:35.436
Okay, well, one,
you're not really sleeping.

10:35.438 --> 10:37.774
You just don't
wanna talk to me right now.

10:40.462 --> 10:45.134
Two, I just popped
three Viagras in the bathroom.

10:46.958 --> 10:48.141
Three...

10:51.694 --> 10:52.814
Cassie.

12:24.972 --> 12:26.252
Eduardo.

12:58.827 --> 13:01.483
Mm, I love fucking you.

14:45.192 --> 14:47.368
Why would you
do this, Cass?

14:51.655 --> 14:54.408
How the fuck could you do this?!

14:59.560 --> 15:00.967
How could you do this?!

15:03.592 --> 15:05.512
Oh, fuck.

15:34.407 --> 15:36.709
Oh. Hello!

15:36.711 --> 15:39.333
Hi! Ciao!

15:39.335 --> 15:41.861
Hey, asshole!

15:46.342 --> 15:48.421
Oh, shit.

15:48.423 --> 15:49.511
Ohh!

16:11.687 --> 16:14.214
I... I think I sprained my ankle.

16:19.207 --> 16:21.254
Do you... Do you speak English?

16:37.350 --> 16:38.407
May I?

16:54.501 --> 16:56.804
How long before this happen?

16:56.806 --> 16:59.427
Um, five minutes ago, maybe.

16:59.429 --> 17:00.774
Hmm.

17:02.469 --> 17:04.290
Good.

17:04.292 --> 17:08.005
If it was serious,
it'd be a balloon already.

17:14.724 --> 17:16.997
I can fix this for you
if you want.

17:18.724 --> 17:19.715
Okay.

17:41.029 --> 17:42.690
There?
That's your house?

17:42.692 --> 17:43.715
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

17:43.717 --> 17:45.603
We passed that
last night. Huh.

17:45.605 --> 17:48.706
Have you... Have you
lived there a long time, or...

17:48.708 --> 17:50.306
My whole life.

17:50.308 --> 17:53.698
Wow. Must be a peaceful life.

17:53.700 --> 17:55.650
I'm... I'm from
the opposite of this,

17:55.652 --> 17:58.050
just outside of New York.

17:58.052 --> 18:01.604
Have you, um,
ever been to the... the U.S.?

18:02.948 --> 18:05.443
Oh. Why not?

18:06.788 --> 18:08.516
Too many people.

18:12.964 --> 18:14.850
God, it's so beautiful here.

18:14.852 --> 18:17.186
I just... I can't get over it.

18:17.188 --> 18:19.265
Have you seen
the inside of the house?

18:19.267 --> 18:20.515
Oh, my God, really?

18:20.517 --> 18:21.921
Well, you should come in.

18:21.923 --> 18:23.330
I could make some coffee and...

18:23.332 --> 18:25.762
- No.
- Well, it's the least I can do.

18:25.764 --> 18:29.697
Mm, you're very kind,
but I must go now.

18:29.699 --> 18:31.809
Well, thank you for saving me.

18:33.124 --> 18:35.585
Uh, I owe you.

18:35.587 --> 18:37.602
Oh!

18:37.604 --> 18:40.385
In Italy, you know,
we kiss when... Yeah.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.572
Okay.

18:43.010 --> 18:43.970
Bye.

19:14.050 --> 19:15.746
Hi!

19:16.706 --> 19:18.495
I'm back.

19:18.497 --> 19:20.832
Hope you liked
my surprise this morning.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.552
I'm sorry.

19:23.554 --> 19:24.833
- My God.
- I'm so sorry.

19:24.835 --> 19:27.392
I didn't want you...
Oh, such a disaster.

19:27.394 --> 19:28.640
I'm so sorry.

19:28.642 --> 19:30.944
No, it's... it's okay.

19:30.946 --> 19:33.183
Sorry. I'm... I'm skittish.

19:36.130 --> 19:38.912
Did you...
You changed your mind?

19:38.914 --> 19:43.200
Yes. I would love
that cup of coffee.

19:44.578 --> 19:45.984
Okay.

19:48.385 --> 19:50.786
Oh, no, it's okay.
I'm sorry.

19:58.977 --> 20:01.983
I see him perhaps
one time per month,

20:01.985 --> 20:06.048
so I would not say
I'm so close with Eduardo.

20:06.050 --> 20:07.903
People are very private here.

20:07.905 --> 20:10.366
Well, thanks
for making the exception.

20:11.329 --> 20:12.959
Not at all. You're joking.

20:14.433 --> 20:15.775
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:15.777 --> 20:17.279
- What's going on?
- Hey.

20:17.281 --> 20:19.166
Um, this is Federico,
Eduardo's neighbor.

20:19.168 --> 20:21.439
Um, this is Bryan,
my... my boyfriend.

20:21.441 --> 20:24.159
Ciao. Federico.
Nice to meet you.

20:24.161 --> 20:25.278
Nice to meet you.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.006
Ahh. What happened? You okay?

20:27.008 --> 20:28.927
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm a total klutz.

20:28.929 --> 20:30.558
I fell on my run, so...

20:30.560 --> 20:32.735
Uh, Federico drove by,
though, and saved me.

20:32.737 --> 20:35.744
You remember that house
we passed yesterday?

20:37.376 --> 20:38.783
Yeah, Federico
lives there, so...

20:38.785 --> 20:40.511
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

20:40.513 --> 20:44.926
Um, but he was just telling me
about the town, um, Todi.

20:44.928 --> 20:46.430
There's some kind
of really nice marketplace.

20:46.432 --> 20:48.765
I was thinking
we could go today.

20:48.767 --> 20:50.878
The Fair of San Guido.
It's nice.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.734
- It's, um, really...
- You, um...

20:52.736 --> 20:54.111
You okay to walk on that?

20:54.113 --> 20:55.583
Yeah. Yeah.

20:55.585 --> 20:56.990
Uh, it hasn't ballooned up yet.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.213
I have to go in town
this afternoon,

21:01.215 --> 21:03.742
so if you want,
I can drive you there.

21:03.744 --> 21:05.182
That would be amazing,
actually.

21:05.184 --> 21:07.134
No, that's fine. We can call...

21:07.136 --> 21:09.310
A cab might be easier.

21:09.312 --> 21:12.926
Good luck
getting a taxi out here.

21:12.928 --> 21:13.984
I mean...

21:18.209 --> 21:21.437
He did kind of save me.

21:21.439 --> 21:23.646
Had to be
a sexy Italian guy, huh?

21:23.648 --> 21:25.342
It was just a ride.

21:25.344 --> 21:27.518
We don't have to hang out
with him once we get there.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.734
Okay.

21:28.736 --> 21:31.103
Okay. I'm gonna take a shower.

21:32.063 --> 21:34.270
Come join me.

21:34.272 --> 21:36.413
I'll be up in a minute.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.596
What the fuck?

22:29.598 --> 22:31.006
Oh, my God.

22:31.966 --> 22:32.926
You scared me.

22:38.205 --> 22:39.646
Hi.

23:05.181 --> 23:06.461
I missed you.

23:19.901 --> 23:21.979
What's wrong?

23:21.981 --> 23:23.869
What's wrong?

23:41.980 --> 23:43.482
Sorry.

23:47.037 --> 23:48.508
Sorry.

24:42.555 --> 24:44.379
Travel a lot together?

24:45.979 --> 24:50.169
Yeah. Yeah, we've been
to quite a few places.

24:52.219 --> 24:54.747
How did you meet?

24:55.771 --> 24:59.417
Uh, we met at a coffee shop.

24:59.419 --> 25:01.370
You don't have to lie to him.

25:02.330 --> 25:03.770
Who cares?

25:05.531 --> 25:07.224
We met on... on Tinder.

25:07.226 --> 25:08.376
Tinder?

25:08.378 --> 25:12.056
Um, it's like,
um, a dating app.

25:12.058 --> 25:14.041
You match with someone
on your phone.

25:14.043 --> 25:15.352
- Ah.
- Yeah.

25:15.354 --> 25:17.913
Bryan likes to say
we met at a coffee shop,

25:17.915 --> 25:20.568
'cause it's the first place
we met in person.

25:20.570 --> 25:22.968
He thinks the truth cheapens us.

25:22.970 --> 25:26.520
Wow. You're one
to talk about truth.

25:26.522 --> 25:28.280
I understand.

25:28.282 --> 25:34.456
I mean, men prefer to think
in grand gestures.

25:34.458 --> 25:38.935
You need some drama to fall
in love, isn't it, Bryan? Hmm?

25:38.937 --> 25:40.055
He still did that.

25:40.057 --> 25:42.041
He just saved it
to the third date.

25:44.761 --> 25:47.514
Huh. How?

25:48.858 --> 25:51.767
I... I cooked her dinner.

25:51.769 --> 25:56.119
You know, candles,
roses, wine, you know,

25:56.121 --> 25:58.008
whole nine yards.

25:58.010 --> 26:01.079
Chicken picatta
in this amazing lemon sauce.

26:01.081 --> 26:04.087
It was... It was incredible.

26:04.089 --> 26:06.680
I was ready to marry him
after that meal.

26:10.617 --> 26:12.857
He hasn't cooked a meal since.

26:35.352 --> 26:37.238
Welcome to Todi.

26:37.240 --> 26:40.214
So there is much to do here.

26:40.216 --> 26:43.990
Great café down there
and marketplace up the street,

26:43.992 --> 26:46.774
which will give you
the real sense of Italy.

26:46.776 --> 26:48.790
I mean, it's perfect.
Thank you so much.

26:48.792 --> 26:51.574
My pleasure. Would you like me
to drive you back later?

26:51.576 --> 26:53.270
Oh, that would be great,
actually, yeah.

26:53.272 --> 26:55.766
No. We're...
We can manage. Thanks.

26:55.768 --> 26:56.853
- Sure?
- Yeah.

26:56.855 --> 26:58.743
Thanks for the ride.

26:58.745 --> 27:00.374
Are you serious?

27:00.376 --> 27:02.614
That's how you treat the guy
who just gave us a ride?

27:02.616 --> 27:04.214
Oh, I wonder why that is.

27:04.216 --> 27:06.295
Oh, yeah,
because no one is just nice.

27:11.512 --> 27:13.750
Don't be naive, Cassie. I...

27:13.752 --> 27:15.670
Hey, I saw the way
he was looking at you.

27:15.672 --> 27:16.950
You saw
what you wanted to see.

27:16.952 --> 27:18.391
Oh, please.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.007
Cassie, where are you going?

27:24.376 --> 27:26.357
Cassie, I-I'm sorry.

27:26.359 --> 27:28.694
- No, you're not.
- You know what?

27:28.696 --> 27:30.678
Yeah, you're right.
I shouldn't have to apologize

27:30.680 --> 27:33.941
for your incredible ability
to make friends with assholes!

27:33.943 --> 27:35.829
Oh, you think
this is about Federico?

27:35.831 --> 27:37.333
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

27:37.335 --> 27:39.511
Hey, talk to me.

27:43.127 --> 27:45.813
I know it's my fault, okay?
I know.

27:45.815 --> 27:47.797
I know what I did to you.

27:47.799 --> 27:49.333
I know how I hurt you.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.093
Cassie...

27:51.095 --> 27:53.974
I know you don't look at me
the same way anymore.

27:55.254 --> 27:57.303
I can't stop seeing it.

27:58.327 --> 28:00.212
Seeing what?

28:00.214 --> 28:04.949
You and him, okay?

28:04.951 --> 28:09.012
Every time I look at you,
it just... a visual...

28:09.014 --> 28:11.508
What do you visualize?

28:11.510 --> 28:14.163
What do... What do you imagine?

28:14.165 --> 28:17.012
It lasted all of two minutes,
okay?

28:17.014 --> 28:19.540
I was so drunk,
I couldn't even see straight,

28:19.542 --> 28:21.396
and then I was
sober enough in the car

28:21.398 --> 28:23.318
to realize what I'd done, and...

28:25.430 --> 28:27.284
Or maybe... maybe you should know

28:27.286 --> 28:29.748
that I had been shooting down
his advances for weeks,

28:29.750 --> 28:31.124
that you and I were fighting,

28:31.126 --> 28:33.332
and he offered to be
a shoulder to cry on,

28:33.334 --> 28:34.709
and I... I never... I never...

28:34.711 --> 28:36.758
I know he's still calling you.

28:39.765 --> 28:41.748
Did you go through my phone?

28:41.750 --> 28:43.923
That wasn't your mom
last night.

28:43.925 --> 28:45.043
Did you go through my phone?

28:45.045 --> 28:46.485
Are you still fucking him?

28:47.830 --> 28:49.971
- This is broken.
- No. It broke

28:49.973 --> 28:52.117
when you let some other guy's
dick inside of you.

28:53.621 --> 28:55.830
Cass... Ah, fuck.

29:13.045 --> 29:14.676
Sorry.

29:38.324 --> 29:39.668
Come on.

29:43.092 --> 29:44.052
What's going on?

29:48.212 --> 29:49.620
Can I help you?

29:50.836 --> 29:52.436
Please.

29:56.275 --> 29:57.841
How much?

29:57.843 --> 30:00.916
How much does it cost
to get back to the house?

30:08.052 --> 30:11.668
How do you always manage
to appear whenever I need help?

30:15.828 --> 30:17.521
Your knight in shining armor.

30:21.043 --> 30:22.866
You know,
someone fucks up one time,

30:22.868 --> 30:26.259
and you
just can't make it better.

30:28.051 --> 30:31.442
Thank you for...
for helping me twice in one day.

30:54.995 --> 30:57.425
Ah, no, no.
Uh, Maker's on the...

30:57.427 --> 30:58.832
rocks.

31:26.290 --> 31:27.632
Bryan.

31:27.634 --> 31:29.168
Mm.

31:29.170 --> 31:32.207
What are you doing here?

31:32.209 --> 31:33.584
What are you drinking?

31:33.586 --> 31:36.144
I... No idea.

31:36.146 --> 31:37.648
It's not what I ordered.

31:37.650 --> 31:39.120
What did you order?

31:39.122 --> 31:42.577
Uh, Maker's on the rocks.

31:43.954 --> 31:46.834
<i>Lucio, due whisky
con ghiaccio.</i>

31:48.306 --> 31:51.311
Sorry about that. I mean...

31:51.313 --> 31:53.070
he's an asshole.

31:59.025 --> 32:02.159
I didn't expect
to find you in this place.

32:02.161 --> 32:06.799
Yeah. Uh, well,
Cassie went back to the house.

32:06.801 --> 32:08.687
She wasn't feeling well.

32:08.689 --> 32:10.319
Oh.

32:10.321 --> 32:12.463
I'm sorry to hear that.

32:12.465 --> 32:14.287
Yeah.

32:14.289 --> 32:15.506
Well...

32:18.129 --> 32:20.433
to a drink between men then.

32:22.128 --> 32:23.246
Cheers.

32:23.248 --> 32:24.849
Cheers.

32:28.721 --> 32:30.191
Mmm.

32:32.688 --> 32:34.446
Mmm.

32:34.448 --> 32:35.727
Good.

32:35.729 --> 32:38.704
My turn. Two more.

33:00.752 --> 33:03.248
This guy she worked with...

33:04.240 --> 33:08.909
he worked in accounting, Justin.

33:08.911 --> 33:12.909
And I was at their
company Christmas party.

33:12.911 --> 33:17.104
Had a pretty epic fight
earlier that night.

33:20.880 --> 33:24.877
You know, I was...
I was in a band.

33:24.879 --> 33:28.525
I was gonna be
a rock star, you know,

33:28.527 --> 33:33.325
and just elope
with the perfect girl

33:33.327 --> 33:35.436
when I found her.

33:35.438 --> 33:39.277
But instead, I...

33:39.279 --> 33:42.797
am stuck in fucking finance,

33:42.799 --> 33:45.644
and I'm too afraid to commit

33:45.646 --> 33:48.494
to the perfect girl
that's right in front of me.

33:50.607 --> 33:53.038
How fucking pathetic is that?

33:57.166 --> 33:58.860
Hmm.

33:58.862 --> 34:02.702
Had you met this Justin?

34:04.687 --> 34:07.020
Yeah, a couple times, yeah.

34:07.022 --> 34:10.411
God, and I fucking
knew it, too, you know?

34:10.414 --> 34:12.750
I could see it in his eyes.

34:16.045 --> 34:18.027
And you?

34:18.029 --> 34:19.467
Did you...

34:19.469 --> 34:21.580
Did I... Oh.

34:21.581 --> 34:24.396
You know, God,

34:24.398 --> 34:27.916
mm, sometimes I wish
that I could,

34:27.918 --> 34:29.965
you know, just to, uh...

34:31.789 --> 34:34.475
Even the playing field. Hmm?

34:34.476 --> 34:37.387
Yeah, just to even
the playing field,

34:37.389 --> 34:40.748
you know,
just so she knows what it's like

34:40.750 --> 34:45.322
to... to just see it

34:45.324 --> 34:47.757
every time you close
your fucking eyes.

34:48.813 --> 34:50.284
Hmm.

34:52.685 --> 34:54.539
Excuse me a moment.

34:54.541 --> 34:56.300
Yeah.

35:40.044 --> 35:45.002
Okay, so enough
of my sob story.

35:45.004 --> 35:47.946
Um, what's up with you, man?

35:47.948 --> 35:49.802
- What about me?
- I don't know, man.

35:49.804 --> 35:53.610
I mean, you just popped up
out... out of thin air.

35:53.612 --> 35:56.203
You know, I mean, what do you...
what do you do for a living?

35:57.388 --> 36:00.842
Well, um,
I work with computers.

36:00.844 --> 36:03.881
Mmm, so you're an I.T. guy?

36:03.883 --> 36:05.801
- Exactly.
- Ah, yes.

36:05.803 --> 36:07.433
- Web stuff, you know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:07.435 --> 36:09.641
No, you got that whole very...

36:09.643 --> 36:13.227
very quiet,
smart thing going on, yeah.

36:18.604 --> 36:19.977
- What?
- What's happening?

36:19.979 --> 36:21.161
What? No.

36:21.163 --> 36:22.761
Are you okay?

36:22.763 --> 36:24.843
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm good.

36:26.859 --> 36:28.137
They look at you.

36:28.139 --> 36:30.121
- No. No, no.
- Come on.

36:30.123 --> 36:31.721
You wanna meet them?

36:31.723 --> 36:33.673
Mm.

36:33.675 --> 36:35.304
No, no, no, I'm good. No.

36:35.306 --> 36:36.393
Oh, come on.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.384
I'm... I'm...

36:37.386 --> 36:38.377
Alessandra!

36:38.379 --> 36:40.521
- Oh, God.
- Hello.

36:40.523 --> 36:42.185
<i>Ciao, Federico.</i>

36:42.187 --> 36:44.427
<i>Ciao. Ciao.</i>

36:45.899 --> 36:48.904
Please come. I introduce you.

36:48.906 --> 36:50.824
Bryan visiting from America.

36:50.826 --> 36:52.681
Alessandra.

36:52.683 --> 36:54.216
- Hi.
- Isabella.

36:54.218 --> 36:55.944
- Isabella.
- Hello.

36:55.946 --> 36:57.800
Thank you.

36:57.802 --> 37:01.416
Um, so is he
showing you a good time?

37:01.418 --> 37:03.433
It was getting boring,
actually,

37:03.435 --> 37:06.600
before your stunning arrival.

37:06.602 --> 37:08.617
So do you want to join us?

37:08.619 --> 37:09.863
<i>Sì!</i>

37:09.865 --> 37:12.937
Come on. Have a seat.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.218
Ah, wow.

37:39.593 --> 37:41.607
Let's play a game, hmm?

37:41.609 --> 37:43.015
What do you think about that?

37:43.017 --> 37:44.935
Which... Which kind of game?

37:44.937 --> 37:48.681
It's called two truths
and one lie.

37:50.184 --> 37:52.584
Bryan, do you know the game?

37:52.586 --> 37:55.623
It's easy. I say three things,

37:55.625 --> 37:58.535
and you pick up
which one of them is a lie.

37:58.537 --> 37:59.975
I go first.

38:02.857 --> 38:07.559
<i>Uno,</i> Bryan's girlfriend
was unfaithful.

38:07.561 --> 38:09.415
- She fucked another man...
- Hey, hey.

38:09.417 --> 38:10.695
and he didn't do
a thing about it.

38:12.841 --> 38:16.614
<i>Due,</i> Bryan is definitely

38:16.616 --> 38:18.471
going to remember this
tomorrow morning.

38:22.024 --> 38:27.017
<i>Tre,</i> Cassie is all alone
at the house right now...

38:31.816 --> 38:33.576
and I have the key.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.238
Mmm.

40:16.582 --> 40:20.516
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

40:20.518 --> 40:23.780
Come...

40:26.117 --> 40:27.941
Come back to bed.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.732
Where's my phone?

41:48.515 --> 41:50.339
Bryan.

41:52.228 --> 41:53.443
Hello?!

41:58.052 --> 41:59.073
Bye.

42:12.835 --> 42:14.465
Uh, sorry. Are you free for...

42:14.467 --> 42:16.354
- Yes.
- Yeah? <i>Grazie.</i>

42:38.595 --> 42:39.970
Cass?

42:45.794 --> 42:47.170
Cassie?

43:11.874 --> 43:13.184
Aw, Jesus.

43:13.186 --> 43:14.722
Are you just getting here?

43:15.906 --> 43:17.570
Yeah.

43:19.970 --> 43:22.401
God, I thought you, uh...

43:23.522 --> 43:25.312
thought you might have left.

43:25.314 --> 43:26.464
Where were you last night?

43:26.466 --> 43:28.672
I tried calling you
a million times.

43:28.674 --> 43:31.616
I decided to stay at a hotel,

43:31.618 --> 43:37.090
thought it might be best for us
to have a night to ourselves.

43:39.872 --> 43:41.569
Look, Cass...

43:49.153 --> 43:51.296
I think I lost my phone.

44:25.089 --> 44:26.816
Bryan...

44:29.600 --> 44:33.373
Cassie is all alone
in the house right now.

44:34.912 --> 44:36.640
And I have the key.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.910
Was Federico here last night?

44:54.912 --> 44:57.533
Are you fucking serious?

44:57.535 --> 44:58.749
- Are you kidding me?
- Look...

44:58.751 --> 45:01.310
he didn't come by at all?

45:01.312 --> 45:05.726
No. D-Do you really wanna
start this again right now?

45:05.728 --> 45:08.253
Look, I...
I just don't trust that guy!

45:08.255 --> 45:11.775
No, Bryan, you don't trust me!

45:14.047 --> 45:15.966
Look, I just...

45:15.968 --> 45:18.685
I ran into him
in town last night,

45:18.687 --> 45:21.661
and I just don't want him
coming by here anymore.

45:21.663 --> 45:26.685
Fine. You know, he's been
nothing but nice to us.

45:29.631 --> 45:30.877
What did he do?

45:34.782 --> 45:36.702
I'm going for a walk.

46:55.708 --> 46:56.668
Hello?!

47:00.476 --> 47:01.659
Knock, knock.

47:01.661 --> 47:02.843
Oh, my God.

47:02.845 --> 47:06.491
Sorry.
Don't mean to startle you.

47:06.493 --> 47:08.379
The door was open.

47:08.381 --> 47:11.164
Sorry. I, um...
I didn't hear you come in.

47:16.765 --> 47:18.970
Federico, what are...
what are you doing here?

47:18.972 --> 47:21.625
Uh, after seeing you in town,

47:21.627 --> 47:24.346
I thought I'd bring
something to cheer you up.

47:24.348 --> 47:29.500
I'm told I make a fantastic
coniglio cacciatora. Hmm?

48:43.514 --> 48:45.048
That's crazy.

48:45.050 --> 48:46.072
Yeah. I mean...

48:46.074 --> 48:47.257
Hey.

48:47.259 --> 48:50.233
What the hell
are you doing here?

48:51.674 --> 48:53.720
Speak of the Devil,
and he will come.

48:53.722 --> 48:55.161
Yeah. Federico
was just telling me

48:55.163 --> 48:57.464
all about your night last night.

48:57.466 --> 48:59.928
You... You left a lot out.

48:59.930 --> 49:02.744
- What?
- I mean, I was telling her

49:02.746 --> 49:04.568
how much fun we had last night.

49:04.570 --> 49:09.047
Yeah. Um, didn't tell me
you made new friends.

49:09.049 --> 49:11.224
He... He said you
weren't even buying drinks

49:11.226 --> 49:12.856
by the end of the night.

49:12.858 --> 49:13.976
Never get that buddy-buddy

49:13.978 --> 49:16.056
with the bartender
when we go out.

49:16.058 --> 49:20.952
I guess... I mean, they just
love Americans here, hmm?

49:20.954 --> 49:22.808
What do you think, Bryan?

49:22.810 --> 49:25.815
What are you...
What are you doing here?

49:25.817 --> 49:29.975
Um, Federico was nice enough
to come make us dinner.

49:29.977 --> 49:32.247
Coniglio cacciatora?

49:32.249 --> 49:34.167
- <i>Brava.</i>
- Rabbit stew.

49:34.169 --> 49:37.977
Uh, it's not a chicken
piccata, I know, but...

49:39.768 --> 49:42.454
Could I speak with you
for a second inside?

49:42.456 --> 49:44.407
Of course.
I was about to ask you

49:44.409 --> 49:47.544
to help me
to set the table, hmm?

49:51.320 --> 49:52.920
My God.

49:54.297 --> 49:57.494
Hey, you need
to leave right now.

49:57.496 --> 49:59.447
What?
We're not friends anymore?

49:59.449 --> 50:01.654
Friends? Friends?

50:01.656 --> 50:03.959
I don't even know
who the hell you are.

50:03.961 --> 50:05.207
I know who you're not.

50:05.209 --> 50:07.704
You're not
Eduardo's fucking neighbor.

50:13.784 --> 50:16.694
Bryan...

50:16.696 --> 50:19.607
Tell me,
which one of them was better?

50:19.609 --> 50:21.845
What are you talking about?

50:21.847 --> 50:25.046
Oh, come on.
Alessandra? Isabella?

50:25.048 --> 50:28.213
It's been so long
since I have had them myself.

50:28.215 --> 50:29.846
Can you please
refresh my memory?

50:29.848 --> 50:31.509
Nothing happened.

50:31.511 --> 50:33.622
What was it
you said you wanted,

50:33.624 --> 50:35.862
an even playing field?

50:35.864 --> 50:39.414
I think you had
the night of a rock star.

50:39.416 --> 50:40.694
What the hell do you want?

50:40.696 --> 50:42.261
Nothing, nothing.

50:42.263 --> 50:43.606
Just introduce you and Cassie

50:43.608 --> 50:46.453
to one of the great
Italian delicacy.

50:46.455 --> 50:51.541
Of course, there is another way
this could go, isn't there?

50:51.543 --> 50:52.952
Hey.

50:54.840 --> 50:56.341
You guys doing okay?

50:56.343 --> 50:57.591
Yeah.

50:58.839 --> 51:00.886
Okay.

51:00.888 --> 51:02.485
Come on. Let's go to eat.

51:02.487 --> 51:05.303
Oh, here we are.

51:08.119 --> 51:10.935
Oh, wow. Smells amazing.

51:13.750 --> 51:14.710
Here we are.

51:17.719 --> 51:19.318
Okay.

51:22.455 --> 51:24.661
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

51:24.663 --> 51:26.423
- Hmm.
- Seriously, Bryan.

51:27.703 --> 51:29.077
Wow.

51:29.079 --> 51:30.582
Don't tell me
you are a vegetarian.

51:31.958 --> 51:35.189
No. No, I'm... I'm not.

51:35.191 --> 51:40.694
So how long did you say
you were Eduardo's neighbor for?

51:44.119 --> 51:45.878
I don't believe I did.

51:46.967 --> 51:50.486
Few years. Why you ask?

51:51.766 --> 51:54.294
It's your house.
Up close, just feels...

51:55.989 --> 51:58.100
Well, "rustic" is the word.

52:00.182 --> 52:02.676
Part of the charm, no?

52:02.678 --> 52:05.491
So you, um...

52:05.493 --> 52:07.062
you live there alone?

52:08.501 --> 52:10.420
<i>Bravo.</i>

52:10.422 --> 52:12.342
That's right.

52:13.525 --> 52:15.220
No wife? No girlfriend?

52:15.222 --> 52:16.211
Bryan.

52:16.213 --> 52:17.524
- What?
- Come on.

52:17.526 --> 52:20.564
I mean,
he's an attractive guy.

52:20.566 --> 52:23.059
You know, he can cook.

52:23.061 --> 52:25.651
It's just surprising, is all.

52:25.653 --> 52:28.693
You see, I don't play around.

52:30.006 --> 52:33.397
I want to find the right woman
and commit.

52:36.756 --> 52:40.115
Well, if you
make this for a woman,

52:40.117 --> 52:44.147
oh, man, she would melt
in your hands, seriously.

52:45.461 --> 52:46.419
Really?

52:46.421 --> 52:47.475
Mm-hmm.

52:47.477 --> 52:50.197
Is that what it takes, Cassie?

52:52.917 --> 52:54.709
I see what you meant.

52:57.396 --> 52:59.282
What'd you say?

52:59.284 --> 53:00.755
No, I didn't say anything.

53:00.757 --> 53:03.092
Oh, come on. You said enough.

53:04.981 --> 53:06.322
What did you say
to him, Bryan?

53:06.324 --> 53:07.538
I didn't say...

53:07.540 --> 53:08.595
Tell her what you told me.

53:10.932 --> 53:13.075
Okay, I will tell her.

53:13.077 --> 53:14.900
He told me about you.

53:16.564 --> 53:18.834
I must say...

53:18.836 --> 53:24.308
I could have guessed it
the moment I set my eyes on you.

53:26.580 --> 53:28.308
The way you carry yourself.

53:30.100 --> 53:33.073
How do I...
How do I carry myself?

53:33.075 --> 53:35.316
You let people inside,
don't you?

53:36.371 --> 53:38.322
You trust in people.

53:38.324 --> 53:41.620
You invited me in
without question.

53:43.828 --> 53:49.169
It takes a very special person
to open herself up like that.

53:51.796 --> 53:55.537
He wouldn't shut up
about how special you are.

53:57.459 --> 53:59.313
You should have see it.

53:59.315 --> 54:01.682
I mean, Bryan...

54:02.898 --> 54:04.113
oh, my God.

54:04.115 --> 54:08.019
This right here
is a man in love.

54:19.443 --> 54:22.897
You know what I love
about rabbit?

54:22.899 --> 54:25.137
The hunt, yeah.

54:25.139 --> 54:26.961
It's not like deer hunting.

54:26.963 --> 54:29.072
Pull the trigger,
bam, it's over.

54:29.074 --> 54:33.809
No. With rabbit, it's different.

54:33.811 --> 54:38.449
You lure it in,
make it feel safe,

54:38.451 --> 54:41.874
make it think it can trust...

54:42.961 --> 54:47.216
and then you wait, patient,

54:47.218 --> 54:50.832
the moment when the trap snaps,

54:50.834 --> 54:52.498
pop.

54:53.777 --> 54:58.257
The look in its eyes
when it realizes...

55:00.466 --> 55:05.999
Ah, <i>la vittoria</i> of the hunt

55:06.001 --> 55:11.759
makes this meal
so exquisite, hmm?

55:11.761 --> 55:13.008
Oh.

55:15.569 --> 55:16.785
Come on, Bryan. Eat.

55:31.889 --> 55:34.223
Well, let me help.

55:34.225 --> 55:36.688
Look, I think it's time
for you to go now.

55:37.680 --> 55:39.057
No dessert?

55:40.721 --> 55:42.927
Listen to me closely.

55:42.929 --> 55:46.318
If you leave now
and never come back,

55:46.320 --> 55:48.337
I won't call the police.

55:49.392 --> 55:50.703
You wouldn't.

55:50.705 --> 55:52.079
Try me.

55:53.456 --> 55:58.254
You know how long
they'll put me away

55:58.256 --> 56:00.656
for cooking your dinner?

56:05.040 --> 56:09.071
Do it. Defend her honor.

56:28.175 --> 56:30.605
Um, where did...
where did he go?

56:30.607 --> 56:32.750
I asked him to leave.

56:32.752 --> 56:34.734
Hey, don't start with me, Cass.

56:34.736 --> 56:37.294
No. Are you kidding?
I'm... I'm glad.

56:37.296 --> 56:40.397
That was... I mean,
you were right about him.

56:40.399 --> 56:42.670
Look, he's not
Eduardo's neighbor.

56:42.672 --> 56:44.844
- What?
- He doesn't live in that house.

56:44.846 --> 56:48.013
That's where I went
on my walk earlier.

56:48.015 --> 56:51.245
No one lives there.
It's abandoned.

56:51.247 --> 56:53.453
I mean,
why would he lie to us?

56:53.455 --> 56:54.957
Look, I don't know,

56:54.959 --> 56:58.733
but, hey, look,
if he shows up again,

56:58.735 --> 57:00.591
we're gonna call
the police, okay?

57:01.775 --> 57:03.213
Who are you calling now?

57:03.215 --> 57:05.165
I just think
Eduardo should know

57:05.167 --> 57:09.197
that some strange man
is coming around his property,

57:09.199 --> 57:10.862
harassing his guests.

57:21.551 --> 57:23.693
Uh, <i>ciao.</i>

57:26.254 --> 57:29.292
I'm staying at your house
this week.

57:29.294 --> 57:31.597
Listen. I just wanted to call

57:31.599 --> 57:33.964
and talk to you
about this... this guy

57:33.966 --> 57:38.572
who's been coming around,
claiming to be your neighbor.

57:38.574 --> 57:43.084
Look, I don't want
to have to involve the police

57:43.086 --> 57:45.452
about, you know, the situation.

57:45.454 --> 57:49.262
His... His name is,
uh, Federico, and...

58:07.469 --> 58:09.644
Hey. So what did he say?

58:09.646 --> 58:11.947
- I left him a message.
- Okay.

58:11.949 --> 58:14.734
Come here. Need to talk
to you for a second.

58:29.773 --> 58:32.491
Look, I need
to tell you something.

58:32.493 --> 58:33.771
Okay.

58:33.773 --> 58:37.644
I was with two girls
last night.

58:37.646 --> 58:39.691
Okay, we were
just drinking in the bar,

58:39.693 --> 58:42.891
and I ended up
getting really drunk,

58:42.893 --> 58:46.891
and they helped me
back to a hotel.

58:46.893 --> 58:48.938
Look, nothing happened.
I just...

58:48.940 --> 58:50.827
Nothing happened?

58:50.829 --> 58:52.939
Because...
Because you were too drunk,

58:52.941 --> 58:54.571
or because you
didn't want it to happen?

58:54.573 --> 58:58.763
No, because I-I wanted
to be here with you, okay?

58:58.765 --> 59:01.130
Oh, God, fuck, Bryan.

59:01.132 --> 59:03.242
It's just... I've just
been waiting for this,

59:03.244 --> 59:05.290
like, to happen, where you
want to get back at me

59:05.292 --> 59:06.953
or... or take revenge
or something, you know?

59:06.955 --> 59:10.890
I want things to be
the way they once were, okay?

59:10.892 --> 59:13.386
I mean, sometimes we
just slip right back into it.

59:13.388 --> 59:14.540
I know.

59:15.948 --> 59:18.923
- I just can't stop...
- Oh, my God.

59:18.925 --> 59:20.874
seeing those images
in my head.

59:20.876 --> 59:22.794
I mean, it's something
that I have to deal with.

59:22.796 --> 59:25.865
Listen, I...
I don't talk to him, okay?

59:25.867 --> 59:27.402
I haven't talked to him
in months.

59:27.404 --> 59:29.289
He... He calls me sometimes, yes,

59:29.291 --> 59:32.330
but I haven't talked to him
since I quit my job.

59:32.332 --> 59:34.282
Oh, I love you, Bryan.

59:34.284 --> 59:38.953
I... I want to spend
my entire life with you,

59:38.955 --> 59:41.481
but... but not if it's
a prison for you,

59:41.483 --> 59:42.666
not if what I did...

59:42.668 --> 59:43.753
Come here.
Come here. Come here.

59:43.755 --> 59:46.315
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I...

59:47.628 --> 59:50.249
- God.
- If we have any, any chance

59:50.251 --> 59:53.674
of making this work,
we gotta trust each other, okay?

59:53.676 --> 59:57.801
You know, I-I'm willing
to do whatever it takes.

59:57.803 --> 59:59.370
I'm willing to do anything,

59:59.372 --> 01:00:01.640
but you... you have to feel
the same way.

01:00:01.642 --> 01:00:03.881
That's all I want.

01:00:03.883 --> 01:00:05.835
That's all I want.

01:00:10.538 --> 01:00:12.425
Let's start over, okay?

01:00:12.427 --> 01:00:14.697
Go get us
a bottle of wine, and...

01:00:14.699 --> 01:00:17.417
and meet me in the bedroom
in 10 minutes.

01:00:17.419 --> 01:00:19.625
We're gonna make this
better, okay?

01:00:19.627 --> 01:00:20.906
Okay.

01:00:21.898 --> 01:00:22.858
Okay.

01:01:06.952 --> 01:01:09.383
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

01:01:15.017 --> 01:01:15.976
Hey, Cassi...

01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:41.129
Cassie!

01:01:53.512 --> 01:01:56.392
There was no way
that was 10 minutes.

01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:13.384
Cassie!

01:02:50.823 --> 01:02:54.663
Okay, throwing
the blindfold on!

01:03:09.126 --> 01:03:10.694
Ready!

01:04:40.389 --> 01:04:42.181
Mm.

01:04:43.364 --> 01:04:45.732
You put on that cologne. Heh.

01:04:49.797 --> 01:04:51.459
Mmm.

01:04:55.556 --> 01:04:56.900
Mmm.

01:06:59.681 --> 01:07:01.153
Ohh.

01:07:27.232 --> 01:07:28.545
Jeez.

01:08:00.801 --> 01:08:02.144
Bryan?

01:08:15.423 --> 01:08:17.183
Found your phone.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.029
<i>"Bella."</i>

01:08:32.031 --> 01:08:34.557
Like, <i>"Ciao, bella."</i>

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:37.375
Say, <i>"Ciao, bella."</i>

01:08:38.559 --> 01:08:40.126
<i>"Ciao, bella."</i>

01:09:37.725 --> 01:09:41.022
Oh, it's crazy.
You're so crazy tonight.

01:10:23.868 --> 01:10:25.564
Fuck you.

01:10:47.261 --> 01:10:48.954
Did you put him up to it?

01:10:48.956 --> 01:10:50.906
Getting me drunk
so I wouldn't come home?

01:10:50.908 --> 01:10:53.146
- What are you talking about?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:55.450
Was it your idea to make a tape

01:10:55.452 --> 01:10:58.586
so I would see it
for real this time?

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:01.434
- I know what you did. Huh?
- Where did you find that?

01:11:01.436 --> 01:11:02.745
I know what you
fucking did, Bryan!

01:11:02.747 --> 01:11:04.506
I don't know
what you're talking about!

01:11:04.508 --> 01:11:06.105
You fucked those two girls,
you fucking, lying asshole!

01:11:06.107 --> 01:11:07.322
I don't know
what you're talking about!

01:11:07.324 --> 01:11:08.857
What are you
fucking talking about?

01:11:08.859 --> 01:11:10.746
- I'm talking about Federico!
- Fuck Federico!

01:11:10.748 --> 01:11:12.730
I never fucking
touched him, huh?

01:11:12.732 --> 01:11:14.810
You fucking got your revenge!
You got what you wanted!

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:15.993
Oh, shut the fuck up!

01:11:15.995 --> 01:11:17.882
Was this your plan
the entire time?

01:11:17.884 --> 01:11:19.353
Or could you
just not help yourself?

01:11:19.355 --> 01:11:22.267
Bryan! What is that?

01:11:30.235 --> 01:11:32.315
What the fuck is that?

01:11:41.051 --> 01:11:42.971
Has it been here the whole time?

01:11:46.395 --> 01:11:47.898
Wait.

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:50.072
- Let me see.
- What... What are you doing?

01:11:50.074 --> 01:11:51.032
Hold on.

01:11:54.171 --> 01:11:55.896
What is going on?

01:11:55.898 --> 01:11:59.832
Look, were you just upstairs
a minute ago blindfolded?

01:11:59.834 --> 01:12:02.073
Yeah. You told me to.

01:12:02.075 --> 01:12:04.025
No. That was
fucking Federico. He set...

01:12:04.027 --> 01:12:06.456
- That wasn't you?
- No! He set the whole thing up!

01:12:06.458 --> 01:12:08.410
He's been playing us
the entire time.

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:10.808
Bryan, how would
he have cameras...

01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:13.112
Think, think, Cassie! Think.

01:12:13.114 --> 01:12:15.640
Okay, have you seen Eduardo?
Have you heard his voice?

01:12:15.642 --> 01:12:18.136
- Federico is Eduardo.
- Oh, my God.

01:12:18.138 --> 01:12:19.928
He made
the whole fucking thing up

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:21.975
just to lure us
inside of this house.

01:12:21.977 --> 01:12:24.858
We just need to call the police
and get the fuck out of here.

01:12:29.786 --> 01:12:32.984
Hey, uh, ciao.
Um, Listen, we have a...

01:12:34.394 --> 01:12:35.832
Hello?

01:12:35.834 --> 01:12:36.856
Bryan, what happened?

01:12:36.858 --> 01:12:38.295
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:12:38.297 --> 01:12:40.311
H-Hello? Fuck!

01:12:40.313 --> 01:12:41.369
What happened?

01:12:41.371 --> 01:12:43.162
The phone died! Fuck!

01:12:44.825 --> 01:12:46.775
- Oh, my God.
- Wait.

01:12:46.777 --> 01:12:48.120
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

01:12:48.122 --> 01:12:50.135
Cassie, look,
I swear I don't remember this.

01:12:50.137 --> 01:12:51.543
He must have fucking drugged me.

01:12:51.545 --> 01:12:53.112
Just call the police, okay?

01:12:53.114 --> 01:12:55.096
It's not fucking working!
God, it's broken. It's...

01:12:55.098 --> 01:12:56.408
Let's get my phone.
It's upstairs.

01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:58.265
- Fuck!
- It's upstairs.

01:12:59.225 --> 01:13:01.369
Oh, my God.

01:13:02.522 --> 01:13:03.671
Oh, Bryan.

01:13:03.673 --> 01:13:07.032
I wish you hadn't seen that.

01:13:07.034 --> 01:13:12.376
Hey, hey,
we just want to leave, okay?

01:13:12.378 --> 01:13:16.472
We won't tell anybody
about any of this, okay?

01:13:18.617 --> 01:13:21.656
I usually just watch.
I promise.

01:13:23.673 --> 01:13:26.489
Then I drove past you
on that road.

01:13:28.601 --> 01:13:31.160
You needed help. I helped you.

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:35.927
I didn't know
we would fall in love.

01:13:35.929 --> 01:13:39.255
Hey, listen, man.

01:13:39.257 --> 01:13:41.910
We just wanna go home, okay?

01:13:41.912 --> 01:13:44.055
Whatever... Whatever this is,

01:13:44.057 --> 01:13:46.806
look, we will
just forget about it, okay?

01:13:46.808 --> 01:13:48.790
No harm, no foul.

01:13:48.792 --> 01:13:50.550
No harm, no foul.

01:13:50.552 --> 01:13:54.166
Look, neither of us
are hurt, okay?

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:57.336
We could just leave this
like we were never even here.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.121
I don't think
this is possible now.

01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:07.672
Bryan!

01:15:06.006 --> 01:15:07.956
Fuck you!

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:15.092
Fuck you!

01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:17.140
- Fuck you!
- Babe! Babe! Babe!

01:15:17.142 --> 01:15:19.828
Babe. Babe. Babe.
Babe. Babe. Babe.

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:21.750
Babe. Babe.

01:15:22.774 --> 01:15:25.364
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

01:15:25.366 --> 01:15:26.708
He was gonna kill you.

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:28.307
- Shh. Shh.
- He was gonna kill you!

01:15:28.309 --> 01:15:30.068
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it.

01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:33.174
Hey, no, no, no.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:15:34.358 --> 01:15:37.109
Oh, babe.
Oh, I didn't mean it.

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:42.325
Bryan? Bryan, what is that?

01:15:43.798 --> 01:15:44.758
Oh, my God.

01:15:45.845 --> 01:15:47.635
He was gonna kill you.

01:15:47.637 --> 01:15:49.619
Now we're... Oh, shit.

01:15:49.621 --> 01:15:51.059
- He was gonna kill you.
- Clean up the blood!

01:15:51.061 --> 01:15:52.050
Clean up the blood.

01:15:52.052 --> 01:15:53.492
Clean up the blood!

01:15:53.494 --> 01:15:57.811
Okay, okay, okay.

01:16:12.468 --> 01:16:14.484
Cassie, come on! Come on.

01:16:14.486 --> 01:16:15.605
Okay.

01:16:29.492 --> 01:16:31.346
Shh, shh.

01:16:47.284 --> 01:16:51.124
Wait. I think...

01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:54.548
Oh, wait.

01:17:05.139 --> 01:17:06.963
<i>Buonasera?</i>

01:17:13.171 --> 01:17:14.707
Hello?

01:17:18.707 --> 01:17:20.627
Bryan?

01:17:26.163 --> 01:17:28.307
Is anybody here?

01:17:34.899 --> 01:17:36.850
Bryan?

01:17:38.738 --> 01:17:39.825
Cassie?

01:17:39.827 --> 01:17:42.129
Hey. Eduardo?

01:17:42.131 --> 01:17:43.729
Ah. Bryan?

01:17:43.731 --> 01:17:45.746
- Ciao.
- <i>Ciao. Buonasera.</i>

01:17:47.218 --> 01:17:48.849
I received your message

01:17:48.851 --> 01:17:50.545
about this man
who's been bothering you.

01:17:50.547 --> 01:17:52.464
Ah, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

01:17:52.466 --> 01:17:55.985
I wasn't expecting you
to come all the way out here.

01:17:55.987 --> 01:17:57.489
Oh, no, please.

01:17:57.491 --> 01:18:00.848
It's nothing to make sure
my guests are comfortable.

01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:03.888
I am the one who must apologize.

01:18:05.426 --> 01:18:08.784
Ah, you must be Cassie.

01:18:08.786 --> 01:18:10.287
Mm. Hi.

01:18:10.289 --> 01:18:13.200
So wonderful to meet you both.

01:18:13.202 --> 01:18:17.936
My apologize that it's
under such circumstances.

01:18:17.938 --> 01:18:20.082
Uh, yeah, no, us, too.

01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:23.727
So, um...

01:18:23.729 --> 01:18:26.863
has this man come back around?

01:18:26.865 --> 01:18:28.783
No. It's been...
It's been pretty quiet

01:18:28.785 --> 01:18:31.535
ever since I...
I called you, so...

01:18:31.537 --> 01:18:33.520
Uh-huh.

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:35.823
Do you know him?

01:18:35.825 --> 01:18:37.744
What did you say his name was?

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:40.943
Federico. At least,
that's what he told us.

01:18:40.945 --> 01:18:43.343
Federico. Right.

01:18:43.345 --> 01:18:46.031
Uh, sad case.

01:18:46.033 --> 01:18:50.606
Um, he used to live in the house
down the street a bit

01:18:50.608 --> 01:18:52.463
before he lost it.

01:18:52.465 --> 01:18:54.640
Uh, money troubles, I believe.

01:18:54.642 --> 01:18:58.960
Uh, I didn't know
he was still around here.

01:18:58.962 --> 01:19:04.046
Um, do you think
he will continue to be a bother?

01:19:04.048 --> 01:19:06.223
I think we got
our point across.

01:19:06.225 --> 01:19:09.966
Okay. Uh, well, um,

01:19:09.968 --> 01:19:11.663
if you don't mind,

01:19:11.665 --> 01:19:13.839
uh, perhaps
I check the rest of the house?

01:19:13.841 --> 01:19:15.599
No, no, that's...
that's all right.

01:19:15.601 --> 01:19:19.312
Yes. Make sure
everything is secure.

01:19:21.809 --> 01:19:26.702
Uh, I mean, it's...
it's your house.

01:19:26.704 --> 01:19:28.432
All right.

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.880
Do you think he saw?

01:19:46.576 --> 01:19:48.302
Okay, we... we have to tell him.

01:19:48.304 --> 01:19:49.646
Are you fucking crazy?

01:19:49.648 --> 01:19:51.278
He's a nice guy.
He can help us.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.005
We just murdered someone
in his house.

01:19:53.007 --> 01:19:54.606
What? No, it's self-defense.
It wasn't murder.

01:19:54.608 --> 01:19:56.462
Yeah. Yeah, at first,
but not when he was

01:19:56.464 --> 01:19:58.382
on the ground
having a fucking seizure.

01:19:58.384 --> 01:20:00.782
Bryan, you saw him.
You saw him.

01:20:00.784 --> 01:20:01.998
He was beating on you.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.821
He wouldn't have
let us leave, okay? I...

01:20:03.823 --> 01:20:06.093
I had to. It wasn't...
It wasn't murder.

01:20:06.095 --> 01:20:07.404
Yeah, but it
wasn't murder, Bryan.

01:20:07.406 --> 01:20:08.398
Look, I know that.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.445
I know that, and you know it,

01:20:10.447 --> 01:20:11.853
but they're
not gonna believe that

01:20:11.855 --> 01:20:14.413
once they see you
beating his brains in on tape.

01:20:14.415 --> 01:20:16.526
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

01:20:16.528 --> 01:20:18.414
But I can explain
what he did to us.

01:20:18.416 --> 01:20:21.453
Look, we are in... we are
in a foreign country, okay?

01:20:21.455 --> 01:20:22.957
His country.

01:20:22.959 --> 01:20:24.366
I was with him in town.

01:20:24.368 --> 01:20:26.126
- People liked him.
- Oh, my God.

01:20:26.128 --> 01:20:28.461
All right, we are
not winning this, okay,

01:20:28.463 --> 01:20:29.901
- at least not here. Look...
- But I can't...

01:20:29.903 --> 01:20:31.757
- I can't... Bryan!
- Listen!

01:20:31.759 --> 01:20:33.740
Listen. Listen to me.

01:20:33.742 --> 01:20:38.445
I am not letting you
go down for this, okay?

01:20:38.447 --> 01:20:41.165
What are you gonna do?

01:21:41.741 --> 01:21:44.939
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:46.924
Babe! Babe! Babe!

01:21:46.926 --> 01:21:49.195
Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe. Babe.

01:22:32.332 --> 01:22:34.314
You look nervous.

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:37.738
I know. I... I just had
a long day, I think, 'cause...

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:44.458
Your vacation hasn't gone
quite as expected, I imagine.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.635
No, it's been great.

01:22:48.748 --> 01:22:50.570
Where is Bryan?

01:22:50.572 --> 01:22:52.777
Oh, he's upstairs.
Do you want me to get him?

01:22:52.779 --> 01:22:55.114
- I can get him if you'd like.
- No, no, no.

01:22:55.116 --> 01:22:57.418
I can do that myself.

01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.241
Okay.

01:22:59.243 --> 01:23:02.155
You and I
must have a talk first.

01:23:10.923 --> 01:23:13.001
Why don't you tell me
what you did?

01:23:13.003 --> 01:23:13.995
My God.

01:23:15.148 --> 01:23:16.649
I didn't do anything.

01:23:16.651 --> 01:23:18.794
No, no, no. Don't.

01:23:18.796 --> 01:23:23.337
This will go much easier for
both of us if you just say it.

01:23:23.339 --> 01:23:25.514
So what did you do?

01:23:25.516 --> 01:23:28.938
I... haven't done anything.

01:23:30.891 --> 01:23:33.451
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:23:37.259 --> 01:23:38.506
What are you...

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:43.656
Oh, just how
you murdered Federico?

01:23:43.658 --> 01:23:47.913
No. Listen.
Okay, it was self-defense.

01:23:47.915 --> 01:23:50.536
And this, too?
Sneaking up on me to what?

01:23:50.538 --> 01:23:51.496
Defend yourself?

01:23:51.498 --> 01:23:53.480
No. I wasn't gonna...

01:23:53.482 --> 01:23:55.497
I was just being careful, okay?

01:23:55.499 --> 01:23:58.953
<i>Sì.</i> You could have shown
Federico the same caution.

01:23:58.955 --> 01:24:01.833
He didn't leave us any choice.

01:24:01.835 --> 01:24:04.776
This did not
have to become so messy.

01:24:04.778 --> 01:24:06.760
We could have helped each other,

01:24:06.762 --> 01:24:11.624
but now I cannot
trust you, Bryan.

01:24:11.626 --> 01:24:13.546
Oh!

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:25.095
No, no, no.

01:24:25.097 --> 01:24:27.497
No, no, no. No.

01:24:29.002 --> 01:24:30.345
No, no, no.

01:24:32.714 --> 01:24:34.697
This one's not on you.

01:26:36.295 --> 01:26:38.115
Okay, grab his legs.

01:26:43.814 --> 01:26:47.079
- Okay. 1, 2, 3.
- 2...

01:27:24.806 --> 01:27:26.310
Hey.

01:27:30.534 --> 01:27:32.293
Did you find them all?

01:27:37.093 --> 01:27:38.691
I think so.

01:27:38.693 --> 01:27:40.549
Are you sure?

01:27:41.957 --> 01:27:45.891
I... I destroyed the hard drive
that they record on,

01:27:45.893 --> 01:27:49.988
so it's all gone.

01:27:51.972 --> 01:27:56.003
Bryan,
whatever happens between us,

01:27:56.005 --> 01:27:58.307
no one could ever know, okay?

01:27:58.309 --> 01:28:00.166
It's gotta be our secret.

01:28:02.117 --> 01:28:04.101
No one will ever know.

01:28:05.636 --> 01:28:08.612
Okay? Only us.

01:28:13.733 --> 01:28:15.429
Okay.

01:28:16.933 --> 01:28:18.276
Come here.

01:28:25.572 --> 01:28:27.556
It's gonna be okay, okay?

01:28:34.852 --> 01:28:36.194
Okay.

01:28:36.196 --> 01:28:38.082
- It's gonna be fine.
- Okay.

01:28:38.084 --> 01:28:39.556
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:29:50.402 --> 01:29:53.088
- 1, 2, 3.
- 2.

01:30:24.801 --> 01:30:26.753
Holy shit.

01:30:55.105 --> 01:30:57.566
Hey, catch this.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:08.064
Oh, you're so far away.

01:31:15.008 --> 01:31:16.832
I'm here.
