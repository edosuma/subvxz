02:45.497 --> 02:48.164
- Breakfast in five, honey.
- Ok, daddy.

02:55.136 --> 02:57.603
I'm gonna steal one of these.

02:57.671 --> 03:00.671
- Want some more eggs?
- No thanks.

03:00.740 --> 03:03.206
Miss Ellis showed us this year's
Citizenship Award.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.674
It's a medal.
It's really big.

03:05.776 --> 03:08.077
<i>It's like the Olympics.</i>
Really?

03:08.111 --> 03:12.011
<i>Well, not that big.</i>
But it's pretty big.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.312
I'm gonna win it.

03:13.381 --> 03:16.414
It wouldn't surprise me
a bit... if you did.

03:16.483 --> 03:19.183
<i>It's given to the person who
exemplifies St. Alden's values.</i>

03:19.252 --> 03:21.784
Faith, honesty, grace,
and compassion.

03:21.853 --> 03:25.453
I just don't want you to be
disappointed if you don't win it.

03:25.521 --> 03:27.120
When are you having
another date?

03:27.222 --> 03:28.122
Why?

03:28.224 --> 03:29.823
Does it bother you when I date?

03:29.892 --> 03:32.191
No, why would it bother me?

03:32.260 --> 03:33.925
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hi, Aunt Angela.

03:34.027 --> 03:37.126
- Hey.
- Hey, honey bear.

03:37.195 --> 03:38.261
I found you a gal.

03:38.329 --> 03:39.705
Em and I were just talking
about me dating.

03:39.735 --> 03:43.530
Not a date, I found you a
nanny, wasn't that the assignment?

03:43.633 --> 03:44.899
I mean, a new babysitter.

03:45.001 --> 03:46.176
I know you don't need
a new nanny.

03:46.206 --> 03:49.534
I don't need a new
babysitter, either, it's stupid.

03:49.637 --> 03:51.802
She's still upset
about Miss Levia.

03:51.870 --> 03:53.571
You should babysit me,
Aunt Angela.

03:53.640 --> 03:54.919
It would be an honor, my queen,

03:54.973 --> 03:56.672
but I think my patients
might object.

03:56.774 --> 03:58.073
Don't worry, Em.

03:58.141 --> 03:59.607
I'm gonna find you
someone you like.

03:59.676 --> 04:04.043
Oh, she also says she's gonna
win another award this semester.

04:04.112 --> 04:06.578
Oh. <i>She's got drive.</i>

04:06.647 --> 04:10.748
<i>You should be thrilled.</i>
Right, Emma?

04:10.849 --> 04:13.048
Emma?

04:13.117 --> 04:15.516
There's a dead cat
in the fountain.

04:32.463 --> 04:34.528
Don't be sad.

04:34.630 --> 04:36.796
It probably happened
very fast.

04:36.898 --> 04:38.630
I don't think it felt a thing.

05:05.549 --> 05:07.416
Ah! Ahhh!!!

05:08.217 --> 05:09.650
<i>Calm down, everyone.</i>

05:09.718 --> 05:12.918
<i>I guarantee you it's more afraid
of you than you are of it.</i>

05:12.987 --> 05:14.319
<i>Emma Grossman!</i>

05:36.802 --> 05:39.801
- Thank you, Emma.
- You're welcome, Mrs. Ellis.

05:45.374 --> 05:50.007
- H... how did you do that?
- We have a nest in our back yard.

05:50.076 --> 05:54.010
My dad says wasps only attack
when they feel threatened.

05:54.112 --> 05:56.044
It's nature, Milo.

06:01.316 --> 06:02.675
<i>I hope you're not allergic
to dust.</i>

06:02.750 --> 06:04.126
This probably isn't the best
place in the house

06:04.156 --> 06:07.018
to have a meeting but...
I'm on a deadline.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.519
No worries.
Do you make everything here?

06:09.621 --> 06:11.354
No, hardly anything anymore.

06:11.422 --> 06:15.689
I have two factories going
but this is where it all began.

06:15.791 --> 06:17.290
Cool.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.159
So, tell me about you.

06:20.228 --> 06:22.427
Your resume says you were
a professional snowboarder.

06:22.496 --> 06:26.196
- Yep, right up until I blew out my ACL.
- I hate to hear that.

06:26.298 --> 06:27.930
It's for the best.

06:27.999 --> 06:32.367
I still hit it hard, I just try
to avoid the dangerous stuff.

06:32.469 --> 06:35.416
Sure, so you've been a
nanny for five years?

06:35.504 --> 06:37.637
- That's right.
- You seem to like it.

06:37.672 --> 06:40.471
I love kids. There's no BS.
They're not complicated.

06:40.573 --> 06:42.706
If they're sad, they cry.
If they're happy, they laugh.

06:42.808 --> 06:43.874
It's refreshing.

06:43.943 --> 06:45.542
So is there anything else
I need to know?

06:45.577 --> 06:47.642
Your references all seem
to love you.

06:47.745 --> 06:50.445
I make a mean grilled cheese.
You want to know the secret ingredients?

06:50.547 --> 06:52.746
- Sure.
- Pickles and mustard.

06:52.814 --> 06:56.048
Boom! Done!

06:56.150 --> 06:59.083
Well, uh...
can you start next week?

06:59.152 --> 07:00.661
<i>Emma's about to begin
her spring break.</i>

07:00.691 --> 07:02.218
Sure. I can start whenever
you need...

07:02.286 --> 07:03.451
<i>Uh, Mr. Grossman?</i>

07:03.520 --> 07:04.686
<i>Here are the Steagle plans,</i>

07:04.755 --> 07:06.788
<i>and you have a</i> materials call
in five minutes.

07:10.692 --> 07:13.991
- Thank you, is there anything else?
- Nope.

07:15.528 --> 07:16.993
Is there anything you want
to ask me?

07:17.062 --> 07:19.562
What's your daughter like?

07:19.664 --> 07:23.498
Emma is... very focused.

07:23.567 --> 07:27.233
She's a normal little girl,
but she can be very focused.

07:27.301 --> 07:28.800
I don't know how else to say it.

07:28.869 --> 07:33.604
She's smart, straight A's,
never gets into trouble...

07:33.706 --> 07:35.104
loves hot chocolate.

07:35.206 --> 07:37.306
- My kinda girl.
- Mine, too.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.740
And your wife?
Should I meet with her, too?

07:39.809 --> 07:42.243
She died just after
Emma was born.

07:42.345 --> 07:45.445
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

07:45.513 --> 07:51.014
So it's uh, it's just the two
of us and um... we manage.

07:51.083 --> 07:57.152
Well, I guess I will see you
next week.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.719
Looking forward to it.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.924
- Your watch is sick.
- Right?

08:07.026 --> 08:08.059
I got it for my birthday.

08:08.127 --> 08:10.926
<i>I got a watch for my birthday,
too. I don't really wear it.</i>

08:13.363 --> 08:15.526
- Careful there!
- You're it!

08:15.556 --> 08:17.558
<i>Oh! Watch out!</i>

08:20.501 --> 08:23.834
- Katie, are you all right?
- Are you ok?

08:24.837 --> 08:27.503
I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt you.

08:27.604 --> 08:29.870
Here, let me help you up.

08:31.341 --> 08:32.340
I'm so sorry.

08:35.409 --> 08:37.676
- Who's it?
- You're still it, let's go!

09:02.126 --> 09:05.725
<i>- I brought you your favorite.</i>
- Thanks, daddy.

09:08.530 --> 09:11.597
- You want to read together?
- You don't have to, daddy.

09:11.666 --> 09:13.931
I know how busy you are.

09:14.033 --> 09:15.933
What would you give me
for a basket of hugs?

09:16.034 --> 09:18.255
- A basket of kisses.
- Good night.

09:34.413 --> 09:36.679
A basket of kisses.

09:39.949 --> 09:42.949
A basket of kisses.
A basket of kisses.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.650
A basket of kisses.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.785
A basket of kisses.

10:02.829 --> 10:05.829
You look like a movie star.

10:05.931 --> 10:08.532
- Don't make me late, dad.
- I won't.

11:03.499 --> 11:05.965
- Nice suit, Milo.
- Thanks.

11:06.034 --> 11:09.902
- He has been counting down the days.
- Oh, tell me about it.

11:10.004 --> 11:14.771
<i>And now, our final award,</i>
the St. Alden's Citizenship Medallion.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.973
<i>Every year we honor
someone of character.</i>

11:18.042 --> 11:20.176
<i>Someone who truly
embodies the values</i>

11:20.243 --> 11:22.442
<i>that this school
was founded on.</i>

11:22.511 --> 11:25.244
<i>This year</i> I am proud to award

11:25.313 --> 11:29.380
the St. Alden's <i> Citizenship
Medallion to Milo Curtis.</i>

11:37.654 --> 11:38.953
Good job.

11:47.826 --> 11:52.360
- Here you go, Milo, good job.
- Thanks!

11:58.600 --> 12:00.332
Wow!

12:00.401 --> 12:02.178
I'm sorry I missed our parent-
teacher conference,

12:02.208 --> 12:04.235
I had a big installation
in the city.

12:04.304 --> 12:06.635
No worries, we can reschedule.

12:06.704 --> 12:07.536
How is Emma doing?

12:07.605 --> 12:10.539
I mean, not to put you
on the spot, right?

12:10.641 --> 12:11.506
She's fine.

12:11.575 --> 12:14.341
She's um... I have to say,

12:14.443 --> 12:18.643
I've never met anyone quite like
her in my 20 years of teaching.

12:18.712 --> 12:20.244
Why does that sound like
a bad thing?

12:20.346 --> 12:23.080
No, I didn't mean that
in any fashion at all.

12:23.149 --> 12:24.681
Emma's never had
one mark against her

12:24.749 --> 12:26.348
and she's one of
our top students.

12:26.417 --> 12:28.583
She can be a real leader
when she wants to be.

12:28.685 --> 12:30.250
But?

12:30.319 --> 12:32.318
Emma lives in her own
particular world

12:32.386 --> 12:36.221
and I'm sure it isn't anything
like the world that you and I live in.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.890
I mean, she has many remarkable
qualities that are great in a child.

12:39.959 --> 12:43.124
Her courage is most unusual.

12:43.193 --> 12:46.961
She's almost without
any physical fear.

12:47.029 --> 12:49.295
And she really knows how to come
across when she has to.

12:49.364 --> 12:50.829
She can be an
actress, I bet.

12:50.931 --> 12:53.664
Please, not an actress.
All right.

12:53.733 --> 12:55.282
- Mrs. Ellis.
- Oh, hi! Excuse me.

12:55.367 --> 12:57.067
- Sure.
- Uh huh.

13:02.872 --> 13:05.138
I'm proud of you, honey bear.
I know you're disappointed.

13:05.207 --> 13:07.939
That medal's mine.
I deserve it.

13:08.008 --> 13:11.909
- Milo can't even talk in front of the class.
- Emma.

13:11.978 --> 13:14.143
Everybody has
something special to offer.

13:14.246 --> 13:15.778
Milo's a good kid.

13:15.880 --> 13:16.945
Yeah?

13:17.014 --> 13:19.648
Well, he's an awful public
speaker. And he can't spell.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.115
Emma.

13:24.086 --> 13:27.785
You're right.
Sorry.

13:27.887 --> 13:31.988
Milo's my friend.
I'm really happy he got it.

14:17.183 --> 14:19.416
You're right,
this place is cool!

14:31.393 --> 14:33.358
We should go back now.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.900
<i>Emma, what's wrong?</i>

14:47.703 --> 14:49.135
What do you want?

14:53.906 --> 14:56.072
I think you know.

15:07.847 --> 15:09.213
One, two, three.

15:09.282 --> 15:11.382
That's good,
I'll email it to you.

15:11.484 --> 15:14.550
- Hey dad, can we get going?
- Sure.

15:14.652 --> 15:15.818
Has anyone seen Milo?

15:15.920 --> 15:16.685
I haven't seen him.

15:16.753 --> 15:18.385
Emma, have you seen him?

15:18.454 --> 15:20.787
Um, the last place I saw
him was by the bonfire.

15:22.724 --> 15:24.589
<i>Help! Help!</i>

15:25.392 --> 15:26.924
Quickly!

15:46.272 --> 15:47.904
Oh my god!

15:48.006 --> 15:49.905
Milo? Milo?

15:51.275 --> 15:53.574
Come on, come on, baby!
Breathe!

15:53.676 --> 15:55.742
Somebody do something!

15:55.844 --> 15:57.343
Call 911!

15:57.445 --> 15:58.711
Milo!

15:58.813 --> 16:01.379
Come on there, Milo.
Come on, Milo, come on.

16:03.849 --> 16:05.147
Milo?

16:08.085 --> 16:09.817
<i>Somebody help us!</i>

16:11.153 --> 16:13.386
That poor kid.

16:13.455 --> 16:17.655
He was lying there on the rocks for
hours before they came and took him away.

16:17.757 --> 16:20.724
It was horrible.

16:20.826 --> 16:24.560
- How is she?
- She's ok.

16:24.662 --> 16:27.894
I think she's in shock.
I think we all are.

16:27.963 --> 16:31.630
She's up in her room, reading.
I'm sure it'll hit her later.

16:31.732 --> 16:34.031
Yes, I'm sure it will.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.585
Emma.

17:07.686 --> 17:10.286
- Morning, dad.
- Morning, hon.

17:10.355 --> 17:13.223
Do you want some cereal?
There's just enough left.

17:13.325 --> 17:16.156
No, I'm ok, thanks.

17:16.226 --> 17:17.892
How are you feeling?

17:17.993 --> 17:20.659
I'm all right.

17:20.762 --> 17:22.594
I hope it doesn't rain today.

17:22.695 --> 17:25.096
I meant about yesterday.

17:25.165 --> 17:26.930
<i>You must be pretty sad, right?</i>

17:26.999 --> 17:30.133
<i>If you want to talk
about it I'm here for you.</i>

17:30.235 --> 17:32.267
Ok.

17:32.336 --> 17:34.435
Do you need someone
to talk to?

17:36.939 --> 17:40.038
I don't really think there's
anything to talk about.

17:49.147 --> 17:51.212
Give her time,
kids process differently.

17:51.281 --> 17:53.846
Don't make her feel
self-conscious.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.448
You're probably right.

17:55.517 --> 17:57.649
She's just so strong,
you know?

17:57.718 --> 18:00.317
I mean, even her teachers
were talking about it.

18:00.386 --> 18:06.754
I just hope that she can...
take some time and... feel.

18:08.158 --> 18:09.489
Look who's here.

18:10.925 --> 18:12.993
Great job, by the way.
She seems perfect.

18:13.060 --> 18:14.959
Miller said she was great
with Sam.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.528
Professional head
hunter, that's me.

18:16.630 --> 18:17.972
Are you gonna finally take
my friend Lizzy out?

18:18.002 --> 18:20.663
Oh my god, you are
relentless. Yes, I will call her.

18:20.765 --> 18:24.132
Hey there.
Let's get this party started.

18:32.038 --> 18:34.671
Washer, dryer, obviously.

18:34.740 --> 18:37.574
- Wow, this place is amazing.
- Thanks.

18:37.643 --> 18:40.742
It was a fixer-upper my wife and I
bought right before Emma was born.

18:40.811 --> 18:42.309
Was this your wife?

18:42.411 --> 18:46.279
<i>Oh, yeah. That was our
Christmas card one year.</i>

18:48.082 --> 18:51.015
There she is. Emma, this is
Chloe. Chloe, this is Emma.

18:51.117 --> 18:52.316
<i>Hi Emma.</i>

18:52.385 --> 18:55.551
It's very nice to meet you.
I like your necklace.

18:55.653 --> 18:57.518
Do you want to see
my medals?

18:57.587 --> 18:59.519
We have to finish
the tour first.

18:59.588 --> 19:01.588
Anyway, emergency numbers here,

19:01.657 --> 19:05.523
all the keys go in that uh,
<i>little place there.</i>

19:05.592 --> 19:07.858
<i>Um, fire extinguisher
is under the sink.</i>

19:07.927 --> 19:10.426
<i>We have a couple upstairs
in the bedrooms...</i>

19:41.414 --> 19:43.813
I wanna watch a movie.

19:43.882 --> 19:46.448
The wind was blowing
the window open.

19:46.550 --> 19:48.484
I'll be down in a minute.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.973
- Amber!
- May Elle!

20:28.843 --> 20:31.576
I don't get it,
this is stupid.

20:31.678 --> 20:36.880
- What's stupid?
- Shirley Temple.

20:36.948 --> 20:39.915
The woman was a United
States ambassador.

20:39.984 --> 20:44.050
I can't imagine
she was very stupid.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.985
I meant the movie.

20:50.223 --> 20:53.089
- When's my dad coming home?
- Soon.

20:53.191 --> 20:55.957
He has a meeting.

20:56.026 --> 20:58.592
So are you sad about
the kid that drowned?

20:58.661 --> 21:03.162
I don't think it matters if I'm sad.
He's dead, anyway.

21:03.231 --> 21:07.597
Besides, my dad said you don't
feel anything when you drown.

21:07.699 --> 21:10.699
You're all warm and
fuzzy, aren't you?

21:10.801 --> 21:14.135
So what're you into?
Music? Horses?

21:14.237 --> 21:16.303
I'm into everything.

21:16.372 --> 21:18.571
What's the deal with your dad?
Got a girlfriend?

21:18.640 --> 21:21.106
No. Why?

21:21.174 --> 21:23.207
Just asking, no biggie.

21:26.912 --> 21:31.045
He had one for a while.
I didn't like her.

21:31.147 --> 21:34.581
- So he dumped her?
- Yep.

21:34.650 --> 21:37.015
You're sorta something
else, aren't you?

21:37.117 --> 21:41.052
- And you're sort of a thief.
- Excuse me?

21:41.121 --> 21:42.519
And you're smart.

21:42.588 --> 21:46.855
I saw you take the pills
from my dad's bedroom.

21:46.924 --> 21:51.392
But not enough
for my dad to notice.

21:51.494 --> 21:56.460
Don't worry, I won't tell.

21:56.529 --> 22:00.696
I think I'm gonna stay up past
my bedtime tonight.

22:00.765 --> 22:04.332
Now go and get me
some ice cream.

22:04.434 --> 22:06.733
You little bitch.

22:13.105 --> 22:16.373
And bring me a couple of cookies
while you're at it.

22:44.259 --> 22:45.891
<i>It's okay.</i>

22:51.563 --> 22:53.729
Thank you.

22:53.831 --> 22:54.862
I'm so sorry.

22:54.965 --> 22:56.464
Thank you.

22:57.933 --> 23:00.166
Thanks for coming.

23:00.268 --> 23:01.833
Hi, Emma.

23:06.238 --> 23:09.005
Oh, don't ask me how I am,
I don't wanna lie to you.

23:09.074 --> 23:11.673
It was a beautiful service.

23:11.741 --> 23:13.774
He had a good last day.

23:13.842 --> 23:15.142
A really good last day.

23:15.211 --> 23:17.243
I mean, he has never won
anything before

23:17.312 --> 23:20.178
and he was so proud
of that medal.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.613
I just wish I knew where it was.

23:22.715 --> 23:25.214
You don't have the medal?

23:25.316 --> 23:28.917
Well, I think maybe it sunk
to the bottom.

23:28.986 --> 23:30.262
Is there anything
I can do for you?

23:30.292 --> 23:32.986
If you have any pictures
of that day I'd like 'em.

23:33.054 --> 23:36.588
Just pictures of him playing, happy.

23:36.690 --> 23:38.255
It really does help.

24:20.651 --> 24:22.816
Dad?

24:22.885 --> 24:24.617
What're you doing in my room?

24:24.719 --> 24:28.086
- Just picking up a little.
- It is picked up.

24:28.188 --> 24:30.187
It's always picked up.

24:32.658 --> 24:36.057
Anything else?

24:36.159 --> 24:37.792
No.

25:15.083 --> 25:17.817
Miss Ellis.

25:17.919 --> 25:18.851
It's nice to meet you.

25:18.919 --> 25:22.686
<i>Believe me, nothing like this has
ever happened in</i> our 95-year history

25:22.788 --> 25:24.520
<i>and we're using
every resource we have</i>

25:24.588 --> 25:26.621
<i>to make sure that it
never happens again.</i>

25:26.690 --> 25:29.123
<i>But there is a legal issue that
we have to contend with.</i>

25:29.192 --> 25:30.425
Sure.

25:30.493 --> 25:31.835
<i>We're reaching out to
all the parents to gather</i>

25:31.865 --> 25:34.026
whatever information we can.

25:34.095 --> 25:36.027
Well... ok, I... I don't
really understand.

25:36.096 --> 25:38.028
So this is an insurance thing,
or...?

25:38.130 --> 25:40.397
That's one component, yes.

25:40.499 --> 25:42.265
Well, what did happen?

25:42.333 --> 25:43.965
No one's given anybody
an update.

25:44.034 --> 25:45.399
How did Milo fall off
that cliff?

25:45.501 --> 25:47.967
That's what we're
gonna find out.

25:48.036 --> 25:49.968
Are the police involved?

25:50.071 --> 25:52.471
We're not at liberty
to share that.

25:52.540 --> 25:55.807
<i>Obviously, if and when
the authorities</i> are involved,

25:55.875 --> 25:57.618
we may share that information
with the families.

25:57.648 --> 25:58.642
Some families.

25:58.710 --> 26:01.643
Excuse me, but is there
something you're not telling me?

26:01.712 --> 26:03.210
Please don't misunderstand.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.579
We're just trying to get
to the facts.

26:05.609 --> 26:09.081
But if Emma heard or saw
something, we need to know.

26:09.149 --> 26:11.816
That boy couldn't swim
and he was afraid of water.

26:11.884 --> 26:13.950
Why was he out on the rocks?

26:14.052 --> 26:15.484
You little shit.

26:15.553 --> 26:20.788
Any information would be helpful as it
seems Emma was the last to see the boy.

26:20.890 --> 26:22.856
I'm sorry?

26:22.925 --> 26:25.523
<i>At least three people saw her
near the rock face.</i>

26:25.592 --> 26:27.468
<i>Now, we're not saying Emma
did anything wrong.</i>

26:27.498 --> 26:28.860
<i>Well, I should hope not.</i>

26:28.929 --> 26:31.928
Listen, I'd be very careful
what you insinuate.

26:34.131 --> 26:35.030
<i>Emma?</i>

26:35.132 --> 26:36.131
Emma?!

26:36.232 --> 26:38.164
Emma!

26:38.233 --> 26:40.133
What happened?

26:40.235 --> 26:41.235
Are you ok?

26:41.269 --> 26:44.069
- We'll show ourselves out.
- Yeah, sure.

26:44.171 --> 26:45.236
Ok.

26:45.305 --> 26:47.537
Let me see this arm.
Let's see it.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.606
All right, let's get
you cleaned up. Ok?

26:50.674 --> 26:53.241
You are lucky you didn't cut
yourself worse, honey bear.

26:53.343 --> 26:57.510
- I'm sorry, daddy.
- It's ok, accidents happen.

27:00.314 --> 27:02.780
Do you know why
Mrs. Ellis was here?

27:02.882 --> 27:06.683
It was about Milo I bet.

27:06.752 --> 27:10.918
Is there anything you wanna
tell me about that day?

27:11.020 --> 27:12.853
Anything at all?

27:12.955 --> 27:14.587
Nope.

27:14.689 --> 27:15.920
You're sure?

27:15.989 --> 27:18.342
You weren't ever out on
that rock face, were you?

27:18.481 --> 27:23.025
- No.
- Mrs. Ellis says you were.

27:23.094 --> 27:25.460
She's lying.

27:25.529 --> 27:28.396
Honey, why would Mrs. Ellis lie?

27:28.499 --> 27:32.132
Because she hates me.

27:32.234 --> 27:37.834
She never liked me.
<i>I don't know why.</i>

27:37.903 --> 27:39.769
Why would she say that?

27:39.837 --> 27:44.339
I... I don't know what's going on,
I'm just... just worried about you.

27:44.441 --> 27:46.273
I'm sorry, daddy.

27:46.375 --> 27:50.842
<i>I don't mean to get</i> upset,
I'm just sad about Milo.

27:55.414 --> 27:57.347
Want me to read to you?

27:57.449 --> 28:00.882
- I'm not really in the mood.
- Ok.

28:02.251 --> 28:05.385
Daddy?

28:05.454 --> 28:08.820
What would you give me
for a basket of kisses?

28:08.922 --> 28:10.754
A basket of hugs.

29:08.258 --> 29:09.258
Hi.

29:11.327 --> 29:14.092
Sorry, I was just checking
on you and Emma.

29:17.163 --> 29:19.564
And we're out of milk.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.375
- Hey.
- Um, I'm sorry,

29:38.443 --> 29:39.852
I didn't mean to startle
you last night.

29:39.882 --> 29:42.144
I probably could have waited
to do the market list.

29:42.213 --> 29:43.277
Yeah.

29:45.081 --> 29:46.279
So what's up?

29:46.348 --> 29:48.187
Um, hey, do you mind if I,
like, smoke in here?

29:48.249 --> 29:54.218
I would never do it around Emma
but out here I thought maybe?

29:54.286 --> 29:56.268
Can you see everything against
that wall, it's all flammable?

29:56.421 --> 29:59.600
So no, I don't think this is the
best place for a smoking area.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.622
Ah, got it.

30:01.691 --> 30:04.456
- So how can I help ya?
- Emma's arm seems good.

30:04.525 --> 30:06.959
I'm sorry, I should have been
paying closer attention to her.

30:07.061 --> 30:11.061
I was with her one minute and
when I turned around she was gone.

30:11.163 --> 30:12.429
Yeah.

30:12.497 --> 30:15.430
- I understand, stuff happens.
- Stuff happens.

30:15.498 --> 30:17.765
Hell yeah, it does.

30:21.369 --> 30:22.877
So let me ask you,

30:22.907 --> 30:25.669
how are things with you and Emma?

30:25.771 --> 30:26.637
Everything ok?

30:26.739 --> 30:28.972
Oh, she's great.
Such a cool kid.

30:29.074 --> 30:30.240
That's good to hear.

30:30.342 --> 30:35.576
She's so... fun and
smart... and funny.

30:35.645 --> 30:37.364
I never would have thought
of Emma as funny.

30:37.446 --> 30:41.079
Oh, not in a weird way,
she's funny like...

30:41.181 --> 30:44.681
I don't know, like different,
in a good way.

30:44.783 --> 30:46.283
Most girls her age
are pretty lame.

30:46.352 --> 30:48.194
Purple leggings and princess
posters everywhere,

30:48.224 --> 30:53.686
but Emma is like...
a lady, you know?

30:53.755 --> 30:55.255
I do know.

30:55.323 --> 30:57.723
Oh, I was looking at more
pictures of your wife.

30:57.825 --> 31:00.491
She was pretty hot.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.826
Yes, she was.
Thank you.

31:08.331 --> 31:11.797
Gotta get rid of these wasps.

31:11.866 --> 31:13.599
Well, I better get back to Emma.

31:13.668 --> 31:15.835
- She wants to go on the scooter.
- Great.

31:15.902 --> 31:21.571
Anyway, I love my job here.
I just wanted you to know.

31:21.673 --> 31:25.573
Thank you, I appreciate that.
I'm sure Emma does, as well.

31:25.642 --> 31:29.208
Yeah.
We love each other.

31:33.947 --> 31:37.213
Your dad thinks you
have major issues, Curly Sue.

31:37.315 --> 31:38.381
What do you mean?

31:38.483 --> 31:41.215
He knows what's up.
He was grilling me about you.

31:41.284 --> 31:44.118
- What'd he ask?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

31:44.186 --> 31:45.885
Don't worry, I told him how
great you are.

31:45.954 --> 31:49.388
I got you, girl.
Don't mess with me.

31:53.458 --> 31:56.191
Why is Mrs. Ellis at Milo's?

31:56.294 --> 31:58.960
<i>You must be shitting bricks.
Gross.</i>

31:59.029 --> 32:00.504
Why would you say something
like that?

32:00.534 --> 32:03.763
'Cause they're closing in on you
now, babe, building their case.

32:03.831 --> 32:05.597
What do you mean?

32:05.699 --> 32:07.099
One day the police
will get involved

32:07.167 --> 32:09.143
and you'll have to come clean
about what you did to Milo.

32:09.173 --> 32:11.768
- I didn't do anything to Milo.
- Sure you didn't.

32:11.870 --> 32:13.402
Anyway, you'll see.

32:13.470 --> 32:17.604
You better get your story
straight or you're gonna get busted.

32:33.684 --> 32:38.116
I'm not worried about anything.
You're just being a bitch.

32:38.185 --> 32:42.452
Look, I don't know what you did
to that kid on the rocks

32:42.554 --> 32:44.121
but I know it wasn't good,

32:44.190 --> 32:45.956
and I know you're lying
to everybody.

32:46.024 --> 32:48.523
And you stole from
my dad's room.

32:48.591 --> 32:50.923
Well I guess we both have secrets
to keep for each other, don't we?

32:51.027 --> 32:53.359
<i>My dad says it's not
good to keep secrets.</i>

32:53.461 --> 32:56.487
If you see something
you should tell.

32:58.098 --> 33:00.397
Are you threatening me,
honey bear?

33:04.601 --> 33:06.411
Do you know what they do
to kids that go to jail?

33:06.441 --> 33:08.336
Not really.

33:08.404 --> 33:10.737
Well, if it's something like
stealing or hurting someone

33:10.806 --> 33:13.605
you get sent to a hospital
where kids yell

33:13.708 --> 33:18.607
and scream and cut themselves,
<i>and you never get out.</i>

33:18.676 --> 33:20.576
But if it's something
really bad,

33:20.678 --> 33:24.478
like maybe if someone...
dies...

33:24.580 --> 33:27.714
you get sent to
the electric chair.

33:27.816 --> 33:31.282
You're silly, nobody would
put a kid in the electric chair.

33:31.385 --> 33:32.683
<i>Sure they do.</i>

33:32.752 --> 33:36.119
Do you know what happens in the
electric chair? It cooks you.

33:36.221 --> 33:40.722
Your skin crackles and shrivels like
when we make bacon in the morning.

33:40.824 --> 33:44.191
I don't believe you, a kid
wouldn't even fit in that big chair.

33:44.259 --> 33:45.226
They have a special one
for kids.

33:45.294 --> 33:49.860
It's even painted pink and they put pee-pee
pads underneath for when you piss yourself.

33:49.929 --> 33:53.529
- God, you're disgusting.
- Google it.

34:04.671 --> 34:06.204
Emma?

34:10.842 --> 34:12.341
Em?

34:19.213 --> 34:20.646
Emma?

34:20.715 --> 34:22.813
Emma, are you out there?

34:25.184 --> 34:26.783
Emma?

36:15.751 --> 36:17.283
Hello?

37:19.456 --> 37:20.955
There she is.

37:21.057 --> 37:23.190
How was your day?
You do anything fun?

37:23.259 --> 37:26.692
Well, I don't know if
it was fun exactly,

37:26.794 --> 37:28.726
but I had a good day.

38:09.453 --> 38:12.987
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

38:14.789 --> 38:18.123
- What's in your hand?
- Nothing.

38:42.773 --> 38:45.273
Oh, Emma.

38:46.903 --> 38:49.266
Where did this come from?

38:50.479 --> 38:51.877
Emma?

38:51.979 --> 38:55.412
How did Milo's medal
get into this house?

38:55.514 --> 38:58.080
I... I don't know.

38:58.149 --> 39:00.716
- Where did you find it?
<i>- It was hidden under the bed.</i>

39:00.885 --> 39:02.851
I found it cleaning.

39:05.887 --> 39:07.920
Thank you, Chloe.

39:07.988 --> 39:11.889
- I need to talk to Emma alone.
- Sure thing.

39:13.660 --> 39:16.358
Emma?

39:16.427 --> 39:19.527
How did Milo Curtis's medal
get under your bed?

39:19.596 --> 39:21.762
I don't know how it got there.

39:21.830 --> 39:27.399
How should I know
how it got there?

39:27.467 --> 39:32.001
Were you ever, at any time,
out on that rock face?

39:34.972 --> 39:37.538
Yes, daddy,
I went there once.

39:37.607 --> 39:42.341
So Mrs. Ellis wasn't lying
when she said you were there.

39:42.410 --> 39:47.212
I guess she wasn't lying.
Yes, daddy.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.879
Were you with Milo?

39:52.282 --> 39:53.615
For a minute.

39:56.952 --> 39:59.152
And what happened?

40:03.489 --> 40:06.056
Emma!

40:06.124 --> 40:08.157
This is very serious
<i>and I can't help you</i>

40:08.226 --> 40:10.491
<i>if I don't know the truth.</i>

40:14.563 --> 40:17.095
Milo and I were playing a game
we made up.

40:17.164 --> 40:19.964
It was kinda like
Capture the Flag,

40:20.032 --> 40:22.365
<i>but with his medal instead,</i>

40:22.434 --> 40:26.969
and I won, so Milo gave
me his medal to wear.

40:27.071 --> 40:30.036
So he gave you the medal
out on the rock?

40:30.138 --> 40:34.205
No, I got it...
later on.

40:34.274 --> 40:36.407
I don't know where
Milo went after that.

40:40.845 --> 40:45.179
Emma, do you know that Mrs.
Curtis has been looking for this?

40:45.248 --> 40:48.249
She wanted to bury Milo with it.

40:48.351 --> 40:52.783
That's stupid, Milo wouldn't even
know if he was buried with it or not.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.857
Daddy?
What's wrong?

41:03.926 --> 41:05.725
<i>Where are you going?</i>

41:08.595 --> 41:10.694
I just need some air.

41:16.033 --> 41:20.934
Hey, Ange, it's me, listen, I need the
name of a good child psychiatrist for Emma.

41:21.003 --> 41:22.234
It's nothing urgent,

41:22.303 --> 41:24.114
I just think that she needs
someone to talk to.

41:24.144 --> 41:25.938
<i>Ok. I have the perfect person.</i>

41:26.040 --> 41:29.640
Oh, ok, good,
thanks.

41:29.742 --> 41:31.207
Um, I'll call you back.

42:04.329 --> 42:06.095
Mr. and Mrs. Grossman,

42:06.164 --> 42:08.030
there's something wrong
with your daughter.

42:08.098 --> 42:09.697
I'm sorry.

42:31.313 --> 42:33.844
I just saw
something in the fountain.

42:40.685 --> 42:42.150
<i>Who did this?</i>

42:54.694 --> 42:58.093
- Pretty happy with yourself, aren't ya?
- What do you mean?

42:58.162 --> 43:02.830
- You know exactly what I mean.
- Nope, I really don't.

43:02.899 --> 43:06.465
Oh, you mean I shit-boxed
you with Milo's medal?

43:06.534 --> 43:09.200
- You're so gross.
- Eat your eggs.

43:09.302 --> 43:12.201
I feel bad for you,
I wouldn't wanna go do this.

43:12.270 --> 43:14.837
And I don't want to.

43:14.906 --> 43:16.805
<i>I wouldn't say anything.</i>

43:16.873 --> 43:19.606
Nothing good can
come of this for you.

43:19.675 --> 43:23.208
<i>I forgot who I was dealing with.
</i> You'll be just fine.

43:23.310 --> 43:25.243
<i>You little psycho.</i>

43:25.312 --> 43:28.878
<i>Emma?</i>
We have to go.

43:33.683 --> 43:35.048
It's good to see you, Emma.

43:35.117 --> 43:37.197
Any time I see one of Milo's
classmates it reminds me

43:37.252 --> 43:41.920
of how many friends he had
and what a good person he was.

43:41.988 --> 43:46.289
- How's your school break going?
- Fine, thank you.

43:46.358 --> 43:50.225
Mrs. Curtis, we have something
that we wanna give to you.

43:58.531 --> 44:00.330
Where did you find that?

44:02.301 --> 44:06.668
Apparently Milo let Emma wear it
for a while and...

44:06.737 --> 44:13.239
and then, when he...
didn't come back she kept it.

44:13.308 --> 44:15.050
She knows it was wrong
and she wants to apologize,

44:15.080 --> 44:18.209
<i>- isn't that right, Emma?</i>
- That's right.

44:18.311 --> 44:22.911
I'm very sorry,
I shouldn't have kept it.

44:23.013 --> 44:26.047
I don't understand,
Milo gave it to you to wear, why?

44:26.149 --> 44:32.050
It was a game.
I was gonna give it back... but he...

44:32.119 --> 44:34.218
I never saw him again.

44:39.124 --> 44:41.456
Well, I don't know what to say.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.159
I'm glad you brought it
back to me.

44:49.497 --> 44:54.231
This whole day is...
I'm still in shock about Mrs. Ellis.

44:54.299 --> 44:55.498
I'm sorry?

44:57.167 --> 44:58.600
She's dead.

44:58.702 --> 45:03.736
She rolled her car on Glendale <i> Avenue
<i>and she was just here talking about Milo.</i></i>

45:03.805 --> 45:06.104
I... I didn't know.

45:06.173 --> 45:08.739
I'm really sad, daddy.

45:08.808 --> 45:13.909
Mrs. Ellis was my favorite
teacher.

45:14.011 --> 45:16.377
Do we know how it happened?

45:16.446 --> 45:19.279
On the TV it said there was
a wasp's nest in her car.

45:19.348 --> 45:21.747
<i>It was a science project or
something and she was stung.</i>

45:21.816 --> 45:23.915
<i>I don't know, it doesn't make
any sense to me.</i>

45:23.984 --> 45:28.385
- Daddy, I'm not feeling well, can we go home?
- Sure.

45:31.021 --> 45:36.489
So now I don't have to talk
about Milo ever again, right?

45:36.591 --> 45:38.158
I'm gonna run, daddy.

45:38.226 --> 45:40.426
Chloe and I are
baking cupcakes today.

46:22.653 --> 46:26.687
Hey, we gotta leave soon
for our doctor's appointment.

46:26.756 --> 46:28.855
I'll be ready.

46:28.957 --> 46:33.391
Daddy, I was thinking,
you're right.

46:33.460 --> 46:36.892
I think something good
will come of this.

46:36.994 --> 46:38.627
I hope so.

46:53.638 --> 46:57.772
Emma, I have some magazines on the
table you might like while you wait.

46:57.841 --> 47:01.273
I'm just gonna have a little
chat with your dad, if that's ok.

47:01.342 --> 47:03.309
Of course, Dr. March.

47:11.815 --> 47:16.684
So, how can I
help you and Emma?

47:16.752 --> 47:19.486
I don't know...
Um...

47:19.554 --> 47:22.620
<i>Well, what is your</i>
primary concern?

47:26.892 --> 47:31.660
Emma has always been different,
very, very much in a good way...

47:31.790 --> 47:35.027
but also...

47:35.129 --> 47:37.589
there's a...

47:37.819 --> 47:42.266
coldness, I don't know
how to say it, um...

47:42.368 --> 47:45.267
a lack of emotion,
I mean, she has emotions, but uh...

47:45.336 --> 47:48.202
she laughs and
cries and all that, but...

47:48.304 --> 47:50.103
it can be um...

47:52.341 --> 47:56.074
I don't know.

47:56.142 --> 48:02.011
She's lying to me and I
don't trust her anymore.

48:02.079 --> 48:06.647
Well, it's very common
for children her age to lie.

48:06.716 --> 48:10.450
<i>Most kids struggle
with their emotions.</i>

48:10.651 --> 48:13.452
<i>They very often</i> don't know how

48:13.482 --> 48:17.420
or what they should be
feeling at any point in time.

48:17.489 --> 48:21.456
<i>It can be very taxing
on a parent.</i>

48:21.525 --> 48:26.592
<i>Mr. Grossman, everyone</i> thinks
their issues are bigger than they are.

48:26.661 --> 48:28.461
<i>More unique.</i>

48:28.530 --> 48:33.818
<i>And obviously there are the rare
cases, </i> and I've had them, of...

48:33.894 --> 48:37.165
real psychological illness.

48:37.268 --> 48:41.769
<i>Anyway,</i> I'm looking
forward to talking to Emma.

48:52.244 --> 48:56.378
So, I'm not the kind of
doctor who operates on people

48:56.446 --> 48:58.812
or things like that,
<i>I'm what's called...</i>

48:58.914 --> 49:00.646
You're a shrink.

49:02.082 --> 49:03.682
Well, you know that term.

49:03.784 --> 49:06.284
I watch Intervention.

49:06.386 --> 49:08.590
Oh, yes.

49:08.620 --> 49:13.100
Well, I'm a psychiatrist, which
is a fancy word for someone

49:13.130 --> 49:16.590
<i>to talk to who can help you
sort things out.</i>

49:16.659 --> 49:19.958
I don't really need
anything sorted out.

49:20.060 --> 49:24.227
Really?
Well, why is that?

49:24.329 --> 49:29.431
I mean, most people have something
<i>that they would like to be different.</i>

49:29.533 --> 49:32.333
I don't.

49:32.435 --> 49:35.134
Ah, I see.

49:35.202 --> 49:41.939
<i>I</i> understand that your friend
Milo recently passed away.

49:42.041 --> 49:44.707
That's right.

49:44.776 --> 49:47.474
How did that make you feel?

49:50.612 --> 49:53.279
<i>Pretty sad, I bet.</i>

49:53.348 --> 49:56.981
I cried for two days.

49:57.083 --> 49:59.115
Oh.

49:59.184 --> 50:02.317
I understand.

50:02.385 --> 50:06.620
<i>Was that the first time
someone you knew died?</i>

50:09.591 --> 50:11.156
No.

50:16.861 --> 50:20.629
Oh, I see.

50:20.731 --> 50:23.330
Dr. March?

50:23.398 --> 50:26.398
Why do people get so upset
when people die?

50:26.467 --> 50:29.734
It's gonna happen to
everyone sooner or later.

50:29.803 --> 50:32.035
It's a great question, Emma.

50:32.104 --> 50:36.671
We all do know it's inevitable
and we grieve anyway.

50:36.773 --> 50:41.380
To feel or to have
empathy for others

50:41.410 --> 50:44.309
<i>is what it means to be human.</i>

50:57.152 --> 51:00.019
Emma, I'm going to
tell you a secret.

51:00.088 --> 51:04.021
I did the exact same things as
you when I was your age.

51:09.893 --> 51:11.669
Well, you two seemed
to have really hit it off.

51:11.699 --> 51:14.160
Oh, we had a great talk,
didn't we, Emma?

51:14.262 --> 51:15.629
Yes.

51:15.730 --> 51:18.297
- Daddy, can I go outside?
- Sure.

51:19.700 --> 51:24.067
Mr. Grossman, I have seen
thousands of kids in my practice,

51:24.168 --> 51:29.003
and Emma seems 100 percent
perfectly average.

51:29.640 --> 51:34.374
In fact, I told her she
reminds me of myself.

52:07.062 --> 52:09.595
- Hey there.
- Hey.

52:09.664 --> 52:12.997
- <i>How'd the appointment go?</i>
- Fine.

52:16.234 --> 52:18.334
Emma's up in her room.

52:18.403 --> 52:23.403
Well, I guess I better put on
some clothes, head up there.

52:23.471 --> 52:26.071
I hope you don't mind me
taking advantage of the sun.

52:26.140 --> 52:29.507
No, you... gotta take
advantage of it.

52:32.144 --> 52:35.344
Gotta take advantage.
Yep.

52:45.819 --> 52:48.152
Don't you have any friends?

52:48.254 --> 52:50.286
What do you care?

52:50.355 --> 52:53.689
- Clearly everyone thinks you're mental.
- Whatever, Chloe.

52:53.757 --> 52:54.935
Now that everyone
knows you stole that

52:54.965 --> 52:58.692
dead kid's medal it's
just a matter of time.

52:58.794 --> 53:00.793
A matter of time until what?

53:00.861 --> 53:02.627
Until they find out
what you did to him.

53:02.729 --> 53:04.828
I don't know what
you're talking about.

53:04.897 --> 53:06.897
Maybe you'll end up in
the little pink chair.

53:09.933 --> 53:11.665
I'm gonna have my dad
get rid of you.

53:11.767 --> 53:14.067
Go for it.
He won't do it.

53:14.135 --> 53:19.271
Your dad and I
understand each other.

53:19.373 --> 53:21.776
You can give me that psycho stare
all you want but the fact is this...

53:21.806 --> 53:23.339
your dad's a DILF.

53:23.442 --> 53:26.274
D-I-L-F, ok?

53:26.342 --> 53:29.643
<i>And he's single, and he was
totally just scoping me out.</i>

53:29.713 --> 53:32.778
You wouldn't mind if he
and I hooked up, would you?

53:32.847 --> 53:36.914
The poor guy needs a release.
I mean, just look at him.

53:37.016 --> 53:39.882
Stay away from my dad.

53:42.353 --> 53:45.252
Or what?

53:45.354 --> 53:47.620
Wouldn't I make a good stepmom?

53:49.757 --> 53:51.956
You don't scare me,
little girl.

53:52.025 --> 53:53.790
I don't care if you stood there

53:53.893 --> 53:56.093
and watched that
little kid drown,

53:56.195 --> 53:57.860
<i>or even if you pushed
him in.</i>

53:57.929 --> 54:00.795
Where I come from a spoiled
little princess like you

54:00.897 --> 54:05.231
ain't nothing, believe me.

54:05.300 --> 54:07.333
It's not nice to
threaten people.

54:07.402 --> 54:13.903
You and me,
we're not nice, are we?

54:36.285 --> 54:40.219
- Oh, Emma, you scared me.
- Do you like Chloe?

54:40.321 --> 54:42.988
- Wait, what?
- She said that you like her.

54:43.057 --> 54:47.657
That you... understand
each other.

54:47.726 --> 54:49.892
She said she could be
my stepmother some day.

54:49.994 --> 54:52.093
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait, hold on a second.

54:52.195 --> 54:54.596
First of all, that
would never happen,

54:54.697 --> 54:56.396
and why would she say
something like that?

54:56.499 --> 54:58.731
- You tell me.
- Emma.

55:00.367 --> 55:03.833
I don't want a stepmother...
ever.

55:07.705 --> 55:09.570
Everything's gonna be ok.

55:09.639 --> 55:12.773
I have a meeting but
I'll be home early, ok?

55:12.841 --> 55:18.308
- Then we'll talk.
- Great, I'll wait up.

55:18.410 --> 55:20.577
Have fun on your date!

55:20.679 --> 55:22.444
- So you never remarried?
- Nope.

55:22.548 --> 55:24.846
You like playing the field
that much, huh?

55:24.948 --> 55:28.348
Yeah, I love it.
It's so fulfilling.

55:28.416 --> 55:31.417
I mean, you know, especially
raising a young girl.

55:39.290 --> 55:40.723
Great.

55:46.328 --> 55:49.828
When I first opened the store
I had about four months.

55:49.897 --> 55:53.164
I was really worried
but then business picked up

55:53.232 --> 55:55.633
and it's been really good
for six years now.

55:55.734 --> 55:57.333
Emma?

56:18.648 --> 56:20.848
Damn it, Emma.

56:30.855 --> 56:32.555
Emma?

57:00.640 --> 57:02.773
Emma!

57:02.842 --> 57:05.974
Emma, let me out of here.
This isn't funny.

57:06.076 --> 57:07.441
Emma!

57:34.394 --> 57:35.726
Emma?

57:38.396 --> 57:39.995
Emma!

57:58.775 --> 58:00.741
Let me through!
This is my house!

58:06.646 --> 58:07.646
Emma!

58:10.250 --> 58:11.770
- Are you the homeowner? - Yes.
- Are you the homeowner? - Yes, yes.

58:11.817 --> 58:14.227
I have a nine-year-old daughter, her
name is Emma, she's here with her nanny.

58:14.257 --> 58:17.317
Sir, your daughter is fine, she's
in a house with one of my deputies.

58:17.386 --> 58:19.619
Now, unfortunately there's been
a terrible accident.

58:19.721 --> 58:23.321
The nanny, Chloe, <i>was in the work
shed when the fire broke out.</i>

58:29.427 --> 58:31.059
I think she's in shock.

58:31.128 --> 58:32.972
She hasn't told us much but
apparently the young woman

58:33.002 --> 58:36.563
would sneak a smoke
in the work shed.

58:45.237 --> 58:47.370
<i>Ok, I will give you two
a moment.</i>

58:54.109 --> 58:55.641
Honey bear.

58:59.646 --> 59:04.079
It's ok, daddy.
Nothing happened to me.

59:19.090 --> 59:21.024
Emma, I know you're awake.

59:35.367 --> 59:37.433
I think we're in trouble.

59:40.337 --> 59:44.037
I think we're both
in very big trouble,

59:44.105 --> 59:47.739
and we need to talk and I
need you to tell me the truth.

59:51.710 --> 59:56.577
I'm your father, I love you, I'm
going to do anything I can to help you.

01:00:06.153 --> 01:00:08.418
You hurt Milo, didn't you?

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.324
Didn't you?

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.493
He was gonna tell on me
that I took his medal.

01:00:24.364 --> 01:00:28.164
I didn't mean to hurt him.

01:00:28.266 --> 01:00:35.002
<i>When I pushed him...
</i> he fell.

01:00:35.071 --> 01:00:40.304
<i>He kept on yelling,
yelling that he couldn't swim,</i>

01:00:40.406 --> 01:00:46.942
but I didn't believe him,
he always over-exaggerated.

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:54.779
<i>And after a while he stopped yelling
and I couldn't see him anymore.</i>

01:00:54.848 --> 01:01:00.084
I'm so sorry, daddy,
I didn't want to get into trouble.

01:01:00.186 --> 01:01:02.251
I won't do it again.

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:16.026
And Mrs. Levia, your first
nanny, what happed to her?

01:01:16.095 --> 01:01:20.562
<i>She should have never
grabbed my arm,</i>

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:27.700
so I kicked her, and she fell
down the stairs.

01:01:27.802 --> 01:01:32.303
I didn't do anything wrong,
she's the adult.

01:01:32.372 --> 01:01:36.573
She should have
protected herself better.

01:01:36.641 --> 01:01:41.875
And Mrs. Ellis and the wasps?

01:01:41.977 --> 01:01:46.178
And tonight, what did
you do to Chloe?

01:01:47.514 --> 01:01:49.780
Emma!

01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:52.625
The sheriff will get to the bottom of this
eventually so don't give me the bullshit story.

01:01:52.655 --> 01:01:53.815
You said "bullshit".

01:01:53.884 --> 01:01:57.485
<i>Emma, do you know</i>
what could happen to you?!

01:01:57.587 --> 01:02:01.254
Do you?!

01:02:01.323 --> 01:02:04.689
What could happen to us?

01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:07.090
Yes, daddy.

01:02:07.192 --> 01:02:08.901
<i>They're gonna take me
and they're gonna put me</i>

01:02:08.931 --> 01:02:12.827
<i>in the little chair, the little
pink electric chair.</i>

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:17.330
I really don't wanna go there,
I don't wanna pee myself.

01:02:17.432 --> 01:02:19.698
Emma, what're you talking about?

01:02:19.767 --> 01:02:25.802
Chloe said she knew about Milo
and one day everyone would.

01:02:25.871 --> 01:02:27.214
She said that they were
gonna take me

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:31.339
to this little electric chair
that they put kids in.

01:02:31.408 --> 01:02:33.906
She told me she was
gonna be my stepmother.

01:02:34.008 --> 01:02:38.910
- Emma, calm down.
<i>- I don't want a</i> stepmother! Ever!

01:02:42.247 --> 01:02:51.384
She stole pills from your room.
I watched. She fooled you.

01:02:51.453 --> 01:02:59.322
You weren't gonna do anything
about it. Not one thing!

01:02:59.425 --> 01:03:07.027
So you did,
isn't that right?

01:03:07.129 --> 01:03:09.895
Someone had to.

01:03:16.368 --> 01:03:19.445
<i>This is Dr. March. I'm out of
the office for the next two weeks.</i>

01:03:19.475 --> 01:03:22.135
<i>If this is an emergency
please call 911</i>

01:03:22.204 --> 01:03:29.140
<i>or you can call my associate,
Dr. Metz, at 914-555-0113.</i>

01:03:44.285 --> 01:03:45.483
This is David.

01:03:45.552 --> 01:03:49.120
<i>Oh hi, Mr. Grossman, this is Sheriff
Peterson.</i> I'm sorry to call you so early.

01:03:49.189 --> 01:03:52.621
Just checking to see that you
and Emma were doing ok.

01:03:52.658 --> 01:03:56.490
- Yeah, we're doing ok, thank you.
<i>- Good, good.</i>

01:03:56.592 --> 01:03:59.526
<i>Also, I was wondering uh,
when would be a good time to talk?</i>

01:03:59.595 --> 01:04:02.360
<i>I don't want to intrude... but...
there are some questions</i>

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:06.329
<i>I need to ask you and Emma,</i>
if that's possible.

01:04:06.431 --> 01:04:10.526
<i>Uh,</i> yeah, Emma's very sick,

01:04:10.594 --> 01:04:13.501
she's upset about the
accident as you can imagine,

01:04:13.603 --> 01:04:20.438
I have a... a big day at work, could
we postpone maybe for a few days?

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:25.141
How's Monday, you and Emma?
I'll come by the house?

01:04:25.243 --> 01:04:27.943
Sure, that'll be great,
I'll see you then.

01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:43.119
<i>Emma.</i>
Pack your things.

01:04:43.221 --> 01:04:44.752
We have to leave.

01:05:09.536 --> 01:05:13.238
- Where are we going?
- The lake house?

01:05:13.306 --> 01:05:16.239
Why?
You hate it there.

01:05:16.341 --> 01:05:20.174
- 'Cause I don't hate it there.
- That's what you said once.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:29.680
- How long will we be there?
- I don't know.

01:05:29.749 --> 01:05:31.815
What're we gonna do there?

01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:36.818
I just need a place to think.

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:56.229
Ha ha! There he is.

01:05:56.331 --> 01:05:58.697
<i>Hey, look at you.</i>
You haven't changed a bit.

01:05:58.766 --> 01:06:04.002
Well, cold air, hard work, and no cable
TV, and you too could live forever.

01:06:04.103 --> 01:06:06.136
Hey, is that who I think it is?

01:06:06.204 --> 01:06:09.871
It can't be, 'cause Emma's just a
baby and you're a full grown woman.

01:06:09.973 --> 01:06:12.573
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you, too.

01:06:12.642 --> 01:06:14.741
You look just like your ma.

01:06:16.844 --> 01:06:19.443
Well, I'm glad you finally got
to come up here.

01:06:19.546 --> 01:06:21.678
Your sister has been
bogarting the place.

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.579
Angela would live here full time
if she could.

01:06:23.648 --> 01:06:27.582
Well, if you need anything you
let me know and I'll be right up.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:30.751
And it's uh, good to see you
after all the years, Emma.

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:31.951
You too.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.120
- Thanks, Brian, I'll call you if I need you.
- All right.

01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:01.013
<i>You still should have called me
David.</i>

01:07:01.043 --> 01:07:03.671
What good would that have done?

01:07:03.739 --> 01:07:07.773
And I wasn't thinking straight,
I'm still not thinking straight.

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:10.418
Chloe, that poor girl, how could
such a thing have happened?

01:07:10.448 --> 01:07:13.477
<i>What did the police
or firefighters say?</i>

01:07:13.545 --> 01:07:17.346
They're... investigating.

01:07:17.448 --> 01:07:18.947
<i>Well, how's Emma?</i>

01:07:19.015 --> 01:07:23.182
<i>Should I come up to the lake
house? I could take off work.</i>

01:07:23.284 --> 01:07:29.086
No, it's fine, we're just
taking some time away.

01:07:29.188 --> 01:07:30.887
<i>Look, I gotta go.</i>

01:07:30.956 --> 01:07:33.855
Hey, call me.
I'm worried about you, David.

01:07:40.762 --> 01:07:41.827
Hello?

01:07:41.896 --> 01:07:45.729
We've found the source of the
fire, it was deliberately set.

01:07:47.732 --> 01:07:48.581
Do you know who did it?

01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:52.300
<i>Not yet,</i> but uh, from what we've
sent the lab we'll know pretty soon.

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:53.369
<i>Ok, all right.</i>

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:57.403
- Keep me posted.
<i>- Will do.</i>

01:08:40.098 --> 01:08:41.663
Aren't you gonna answer?

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.919
<i>The killing started
with the family pet,</i>

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:23.288
<i>but as Timothy grew,
so did his crimes.</i>

01:09:23.357 --> 01:09:28.425
<i>Dr. Marshalovitz, an expert on
violet child sociopaths explains:</i>

01:09:28.493 --> 01:09:32.961
<i>The violence seems to be inside
them, buried like a bad seed.</i>

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:37.229
<i>Eventually it grows and once it
starts... it doesn't seem to stop.</i>

01:09:39.868 --> 01:09:42.834
Emma.

01:09:42.903 --> 01:09:46.336
I don't like you
sneaking around like that.

01:09:46.404 --> 01:09:49.837
How long have you
been standing there?

01:09:49.906 --> 01:09:52.939
Were you snooping on me?

01:09:53.009 --> 01:09:55.309
I think you were
snooping on me.

01:09:58.178 --> 01:10:03.547
I told you, I didn't
do anything wrong.

01:10:03.649 --> 01:10:07.215
I would never hurt
anyone for no reason.

01:10:07.284 --> 01:10:09.483
I would never, ever do that.

01:10:11.887 --> 01:10:16.422
Do you think I would?
Do you, daddy?

01:10:18.358 --> 01:10:20.524
I don't know anymore.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.060
That makes me sad.

01:12:53.485 --> 01:12:54.485
Why?

01:12:58.321 --> 01:13:00.621
Why would you do that to me?

01:13:03.323 --> 01:13:07.691
- I'm the only person you have.
- No.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.661
If something happened to you
I'd live with aunt Angela.

01:13:12.730 --> 01:13:15.196
At least she thinks I'm nice.

01:13:17.033 --> 01:13:19.199
Oh my god.

01:15:44.656 --> 01:15:48.422
I brought you your favorite.

01:15:48.491 --> 01:15:52.825
- Can I have whipped cream on it?
- Sure.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.741
Do you wanna read
together, daddy?

01:16:17.809 --> 01:16:20.609
I don't think so.

01:16:20.678 --> 01:16:24.611
I think you should just sleep.

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:27.546
Will you sit with me
until I fall asleep?

01:16:31.484 --> 01:16:33.417
Sure, honey bear.

01:16:51.095 --> 01:16:52.427
The doctors told your mommy

01:16:52.496 --> 01:16:58.699
that if she didn't take
her medicine she might die.

01:16:58.767 --> 01:17:05.002
<i>And she said</i> "only if you can
promise me that it won't hurt my baby".

01:17:05.103 --> 01:17:09.371
<i>She always did whatever she wanted
to do, no matter what the cost.</i>

01:17:12.442 --> 01:17:14.675
You remind me of her.

01:17:17.811 --> 01:17:20.679
Do you know where
we're gonna go yet?

01:17:23.449 --> 01:17:26.315
Yes.

01:17:26.417 --> 01:17:28.549
Somewhere safe.

01:17:41.192 --> 01:17:44.927
I love you, daddy.

01:17:44.996 --> 01:17:47.261
I love you, too, honey bear.

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:54.310
Angela, she tried to kill me, she
turned on all the gas in the house!

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:57.535
<i>David, what you're saying
doesn't make any sense.</i>

01:17:57.637 --> 01:17:59.868
<i>- You're talking about Emma.</i>
- And you don't understand!

01:17:59.971 --> 01:18:04.838
<i>She's nine years old.
Nine-year-olds don't kill people.</i>

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:08.941
<i>Listen to yourself.
You need help.</i>

01:18:09.043 --> 01:18:11.009
<i>- Let me come get you.</i>
- She needs help!

01:18:11.078 --> 01:18:12.677
But I'm not gonna let
them take her away.

01:18:12.712 --> 01:18:15.945
She's not gonna live the rest
of her life in some institution...

01:18:16.014 --> 01:18:17.379
or prison.

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:26.585
I'm her father...
I have to protect her.

01:18:26.654 --> 01:18:30.120
And I have protected her.

01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:32.489
I am so sorry, Angela.

01:18:32.558 --> 01:18:36.391
I am so deeply sorry,
but there is no other way

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.254
and I have thought about
every other option, because...

01:18:41.732 --> 01:18:43.617
she'll do it again.

01:18:43.732 --> 01:18:49.432
<i>David,</i> David, wait.
What have you done?

01:18:49.534 --> 01:18:51.833
It's done.

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:27.422
Night night, daddy.

01:19:36.863 --> 01:19:39.462
- You're alive?
- Yes, daddy.

01:19:39.531 --> 01:19:41.897
<i>I didn't drink the hot
chocolate you made for me.</i>

01:19:41.999 --> 01:19:44.967
You did...
when I switched them.

01:20:00.077 --> 01:20:01.757
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:20:04.446 --> 01:20:07.046
<i>Help me!
My dad's trying to kill me!</i>

01:20:07.148 --> 01:20:09.214
<i>I am sorry can you say
that again?</i>

01:20:09.316 --> 01:20:10.882
<i>- Emma!
- What is your emergency?</i>

01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:13.216
I'm Emma Grossman,
I'm at our lake house,

01:20:18.388 --> 01:20:19.821
Emma!

01:20:22.858 --> 01:20:24.190
Emma?

01:20:26.493 --> 01:20:27.958
Emma?

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:41.333
Emma, I know you're in there.

01:20:48.473 --> 01:20:51.206
Emma! Open the door!

01:20:54.643 --> 01:20:57.844
<i>Emma!
Open...</i>

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.381
Emma, just come out.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:21:07.584 --> 01:21:10.919
<i>We'll just go to sleep together,</i>

01:21:11.021 --> 01:21:12.886
and we'll go see mommy.

01:21:15.856 --> 01:21:17.189
Emma!

01:21:25.296 --> 01:21:27.662
Stop right there, David!
What the hell's going on?

01:21:27.764 --> 01:21:30.696
Help! He's trying to kill me!

01:21:30.765 --> 01:21:32.265
Don't listen to her!

01:21:32.367 --> 01:21:34.169
She's not right, there's
something wrong with her.

01:21:34.235 --> 01:21:38.135
<i>- Put down the gun.</i>
- I have to do this.

01:21:38.237 --> 01:21:39.435
Please.

01:21:39.537 --> 01:21:44.372
I have to protect her from
herself. They're coming for her.

01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:47.373
I will not let you
hurt that girl.

01:21:47.476 --> 01:21:52.977
That's just the problem.
<i>Nothing hurts her.</i>

01:21:53.046 --> 01:21:54.045
Forgive me.

01:22:45.779 --> 01:22:49.378
He was gonna shoot that
little girl, no question.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.746
I just wish I'd
been there sooner.

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.820
I'm so sorry, Emma.

01:23:02.889 --> 01:23:09.122
- Was daddy sick?
<i>- Yes, yes, I think so.</i>

01:23:09.759 --> 01:23:12.258
I think your daddy was sick.

01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:18.529
Everything is gonna be ok.

01:23:18.597 --> 01:23:26.594
