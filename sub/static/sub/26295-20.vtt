WEBVTT

00:07.485 --> 00:09.357
Will!

00:09.400 --> 00:12.012
Owen! Hi!

00:12.055 --> 00:15.015
- Hi.
- Wow, you're getting so big.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.775
Might be time for you to start
playing football.

00:16.799 --> 00:20.150
No, Mom wants me
to protect my brain.

00:20.194 --> 00:23.762
Smart lady, your mom.
Where is she?

00:23.806 --> 00:26.069
Um, Natalie's in the cafÃ©.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.873
She's just getting us
some coffee really quick,

00:27.897 --> 00:29.638
so I'm... I'm watching Owen.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.161
I'm Phillip Davis.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.946
Yeah, Will Halstead.
We haven't officially met.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.079
Natalie and I, we work together.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.125
She... she's told me about you.

00:38.168 --> 00:40.431
Good things, I hope.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.694
Of course.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.741
- How's your daughter?
- She's doing her best.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.699
We're here for
a surgery counsel,

00:47.743 --> 00:49.266
and I suggested Dr. Rhodes.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.660
Yeah, he's one of the best.
You're in good hands.

00:51.703 --> 00:55.533
Phillip is gonna teach me
how to ride a horse.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.013
He is?

00:57.057 --> 01:00.669
Yeah, I... I own a ranch
in, uh, in Texas.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.149
Ain't that right, partner?

01:02.192 --> 01:04.455
- Yee-haw.
- Yee-haw!

01:05.935 --> 01:08.764
Oh! Hey, Will.
Did you guys meet?

01:08.807 --> 01:11.201
- Yeah, just now.
- Thank you.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.724
All right, come on, Owen,

01:12.768 --> 01:14.509
let's get you to daycare, buddy.

01:14.552 --> 01:15.336
Come on.

01:15.379 --> 01:16.728
See you later, little man.

01:16.772 --> 01:19.557
No, I want to play with you.

01:23.257 --> 01:25.868
Some other time, bud.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.696
There you go.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.567
Yeah.

01:29.611 --> 01:30.742
Let's go.

01:30.786 --> 01:33.093
Will, it was great meeting you.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.748
Yeah, you too.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.098
I'll see you at work.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.925
See you. Are you ready to go?

01:39.969 --> 01:42.580
All right, bud.

01:42.624 --> 01:45.192
This is Gaia.
She won't let us treat her.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.150
No visible injuries,
but she's been screaming

01:47.194 --> 01:49.041
in pain the whole ride over
and wouldn't tell us why.

01:49.065 --> 01:51.154
Gaia, I'm Dr. Choi.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.982
Oh, yeah. She's combative too.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.592
- Is she under arrest?
- We'll see.

01:54.636 --> 01:55.767
We raided a flophouse

01:55.811 --> 01:56.918
after neighbors complained
of a smell.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.205
- Drug den?
- Looks like it.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.120
All right, let's transfer her
on my count.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.426
One, two, three.

02:02.470 --> 02:05.125
- Any idea what she's on?
- Not a clue, but it's lethal.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.257
We've got ten dead bodies,
only two survivors.

02:07.301 --> 02:08.780
Gaia and another woman, Meadow.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.174
- She's in the ambo behind us.
- I'll go get her.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.567
Gaia, I can see you're in pain,

02:12.610 --> 02:14.438
but I can't help you
if you don't help me.

02:14.482 --> 02:17.006
Dr. Choi?

02:17.049 --> 02:19.356
What kind of drug does that?

02:19.400 --> 02:21.750
Gaia, what did you take?

02:24.840 --> 02:26.407
This is Burgess.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.017
Meadow, keep looking at me,
all right?

02:28.060 --> 02:29.192
Keep breathing.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.629
It burns!

02:31.673 --> 02:33.153
Ooh, I'm on fire!

02:33.196 --> 02:35.111
All right, let's transfer her
on my count.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.767
Ready? One, two, three.

02:40.116 --> 02:41.485
All right, let's get a urine
and blood toxin,

02:41.509 --> 02:44.076
a CBC, CMP, a chest X-ray,
and an EKG.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.862
No! I don't want your help!

02:46.905 --> 02:48.037
Oh! Get her.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.169
Meadow?

02:50.213 --> 02:51.475
Meadow?

02:51.519 --> 02:52.974
She's not putting
any weight on her legs.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.174
Leave me alone.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.479
Meadow, you do that again,

02:55.523 --> 02:57.022
I'm gonna need to put you
in restraints.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.134
Don't touch me!

02:58.178 --> 02:59.658
- Meadow.
- No! I said don't touch me!

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:14.629 --> 03:18.502
Gaia, this would go
so much easier for you

03:18.546 --> 03:20.417
if... if you just talked to me.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.727
Just tell me what drug you took,

03:25.770 --> 03:29.426
and we can forget about all
my other questions for now.

03:29.470 --> 03:32.037
Would you let us take
a little urine sample

03:32.081 --> 03:34.388
so we can figure it out
for ourselves?

03:40.481 --> 03:45.268
Okay. No IV, no monitor,
no blood, no urine.

03:46.835 --> 03:49.794
Look, you're clearly
very uncomfortable.

03:49.838 --> 03:52.275
At least let me give you
something for the pain.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.420
Gaia has
pronounced hyperesthesia.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.291
Excruciating pain
from the lightest touch.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.075
Even a slight breeze
against her skin.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.294
So does Meadow.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.644
But she also has
lower extremity paresis.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.994
And still no idea what drug
we're dealing with?

04:16.038 --> 04:18.432
Whatever it is, it's going
after the nervous system,

04:18.475 --> 04:20.017
and it'll be days before
the county sends us

04:20.041 --> 04:21.652
the autopsies
on the other victims.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.001
You get anywhere?

04:23.045 --> 04:25.656
They won't say anything.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.311
And no guarantee of
doctor-patient confidentiality

04:28.355 --> 04:29.617
would put them at ease?

04:29.660 --> 04:31.183
They turned down morphine.

04:31.227 --> 04:34.230
I'm guessing they could
care less about HIPAA.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.579
So what do we do now?

04:35.623 --> 04:37.277
They're cognizant, responsive.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.191
They have the right
to refuse care.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.455
Hopefully these young women
will change their minds

04:41.498 --> 04:42.934
and accept treatment.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.502
Seriously? Wait and see
is the best we can do?

04:45.546 --> 04:47.330
Our hands are tied.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.463
Well, keep me posted.

04:55.469 --> 04:58.602
Now, I know that I have given
you a ton of information,

04:58.646 --> 05:00.996
so if you get home,
you feel overwhelmed,

05:01.039 --> 05:02.539
and you realize you have
some questions,

05:02.563 --> 05:04.304
just give me a call.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.438
Okay. I'm nervous.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.310
Sophie's gonna do just fine.

05:11.920 --> 05:16.316
Damn, I am saying...
Get on that... get me some...

05:16.359 --> 05:17.882
Hey, hey. Uh, what's going on?

05:17.926 --> 05:19.841
- I-I-I can't breathe.
- Okay.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.538
What are you doing
all the way up here?

05:21.582 --> 05:24.454
Why didn't you go to the ED?

05:26.282 --> 05:28.240
Your lungs sound junky.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.503
How are your legs?

05:29.546 --> 05:30.721
Uh, swollen.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.419
- All right.
- Yeah.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.029
We're gonna admit you
to the CICU.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.727
Let's get stat labs,
chest X-ray, EKG, and echo.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.207
Come on. Here we go.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.688
Yeah, I-I-I feel like
I did before my surgery.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.560
I thought Dr. Bekker
fixed my ASD.

05:43.604 --> 05:46.302
Yeah, so did I.

05:48.696 --> 05:52.395
I met Natalie's boyfriend,
Phillip, this morning.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.050
He told Owen he owns
a cattle ranch.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.530
Okay.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.662
You ever seen his hands?
They're smooth.

05:58.706 --> 06:01.143
Like, manicured. No calluses.

06:01.186 --> 06:05.190
So people with pretty hands
can't own livestock?

06:05.234 --> 06:08.542
Come on. No way a guy with
hands like that owns a ranch.

06:08.585 --> 06:12.415
Or... he just wears gloves
when he works,

06:12.459 --> 06:16.332
like we do, all day long.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.899
I don't buy it.

06:17.942 --> 06:21.337
I think he's lying and using
Owen to get close to Natalie.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.384
I think... you overthink things.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.911
Hey.

06:31.608 --> 06:34.132
It was nice to see Owen.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.438
Been awhile.

06:35.482 --> 06:38.615
Yeah, he was excited to see you.

06:38.659 --> 06:41.183
Phillip seems like a nice guy.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.272
He is. Thanks.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.273
I mean, he must be nice

06:44.316 --> 06:46.057
if you're bringing him
around Owen.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.624
Excuse me?

06:47.668 --> 06:49.931
You've been dating,
what, six weeks now?

06:49.974 --> 06:51.541
It took you
a heck of a lot longer

06:51.585 --> 06:52.890
to let me get close to Owen

06:52.934 --> 06:54.825
and we've been working together
for years by then.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.198
You know, I don't need to defend

06:56.241 --> 06:57.895
my parenting choices to you.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.745
Honestly, though, how well
do you really know him?

07:01.769 --> 07:04.641
Okay, Dr. Halstead,
you have a patient in six.

07:16.261 --> 07:19.700
Hi. I'm Dr. Halstead.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.833
Vasiley Qipaqli?

07:23.834 --> 07:25.357
Butchered it, didn't I?

07:25.401 --> 07:27.205
You got close.
Just call him Vee. It's easier.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.666
Uh, I'm his cousin,
Brandon Wycoff.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.363
Nice to meet you.

07:31.407 --> 07:34.018
So, Vee, what happened?

07:34.062 --> 07:35.716
He's visiting me from Moldova.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.892
He knows, like, ten words
of English.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.807
Yeah, that's... okay.
We can get a translator.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.199
Well, good luck.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.854
Most people there
speak Russian or Romanian.

07:43.898 --> 07:47.118
He's from the South.
He speaks Gagauz.

07:48.598 --> 07:49.880
It's just better
if I do the talking.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.210
Long story short,
he fell in the shower.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.255
All right.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.867
Look at the back of your head.

07:58.869 --> 08:02.873
Eh, minor head laceration.
Doesn't even need a stitch.

08:04.745 --> 08:07.008
Yeah, hey...

08:08.139 --> 08:09.358
Anything hurt?

08:11.012 --> 08:12.622
Pain?

08:12.666 --> 08:16.234
Oh, I-I okay.

08:16.278 --> 08:18.410
Okay, good.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.282
Yeah.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.675
I want to get an X-ray.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.894
But I think the arm
is just bruised.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.113
There's nothing internal?

08:25.156 --> 08:26.723
I'm not seeing anything
concerning.

08:26.767 --> 08:27.724
Oh, thank God.

08:27.768 --> 08:30.074
If he's a no-go, I'm screwed.

08:30.118 --> 08:32.554
Sorry?

08:32.599 --> 08:35.340
Oh. That came out wrong.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.517
Um...

08:43.304 --> 08:45.655
Fistula for dialysis

08:45.699 --> 08:47.657
and stage renal disease?

08:47.701 --> 08:50.530
Yeah.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.053
My only hope is a new kidney.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.621
Luckily, he's donating me
one of his.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.364
I love you, cuz.

09:04.892 --> 09:08.156
Meadow, these are the same
lesions we found on Gaia.

09:08.199 --> 09:12.377
You're getting worse.
Please just let us help you.

09:12.421 --> 09:13.465
No.

09:13.509 --> 09:17.295
Dr. Choi, come quick!

09:17.339 --> 09:18.514
Gaia.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.606
She's not breathing.
No pulse. Ventilator.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.739
I'll take a quick look.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.574
Asystole. She's gone.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.232
Time of death, 11:10.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.973
I only left her
for a few minutes.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.627
I didn't hear her, I swear.

09:44.671 --> 09:45.976
It's not your fault.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.936
She wouldn't let us
put on the monitors.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.460
She killed herself?

09:59.816 --> 10:02.166
Suicide? Why?

10:02.210 --> 10:03.298
All I can come up with is,

10:03.341 --> 10:05.213
the pain must've been
too much to bare.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.649
I'm gonna have to imagine.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.651
Meadow's going through
the same thing.

10:08.695 --> 10:09.913
I'm sorry, Ethan.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.262
Yeah.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.267
- Dr. Manning?
- Yeah.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.661
We ordered a postmortem
tox screen for Gaia.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.924
Hopefully it'll show us
what drug we're dealing with.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.230
Yeah, but I'm not so sure

10:22.273 --> 10:23.927
we're dealing with
a drug anymore.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.450
Look at all this hair.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.167
Is that from when Ethan
pulled off the bag?

10:27.191 --> 10:28.386
Yeah, but there's
too much of it.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.325
I-I can't think
of a recreational drug

10:30.368 --> 10:33.633
that would account
for this amount of hair loss.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.244
Heavy metal toxin or poison?

10:36.287 --> 10:38.463
That run-down house
where they found them?

10:38.507 --> 10:40.093
Any number of contaminants
could be in there.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.903
All right, I'll have the labs
expand Gaia's blood tests,

10:42.946 --> 10:45.775
search for heavy metals and
toxins as well as other drugs.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.821
But, you know,
it still doesn't add up.

10:47.864 --> 10:51.694
If neither Gaia or Meadow
were taking an illegal drug,

10:51.738 --> 10:54.784
why were they so adamant
about refusing treatment?

10:57.004 --> 10:59.441
Patient's middle name?

10:59.484 --> 11:01.138
Is that really necessary?

11:01.182 --> 11:03.358
I never put mine on anything.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.534
Okay. Date of birth.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.928
I don't know, I-I...

11:07.971 --> 11:09.016
I'm 30.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.714
He's a year younger than me,
maybe two.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.456
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

11:14.499 --> 11:18.155
The intake form has
a few black boxes.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.679
More than a few.

11:19.722 --> 11:22.290
Look, the paperwork
is irrelevant.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.248
I'm covering the costs.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.294
Billing is still
going to want information.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.556
Cash is king.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.950
I'm sure they'll make
an exception.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.389
Are we done?

11:35.782 --> 11:37.479
Thanks, Leah.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.309
Kind of shooting
the messenger, don't you think?

11:41.352 --> 11:43.572
I'll buy her something
from the gift shop.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.314
Vee's X-ray?

11:46.357 --> 11:47.707
No fracture.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.665
Great.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.015
We can go.

11:52.059 --> 11:53.016
Oh!

11:53.060 --> 11:55.192
You all right?

11:55.236 --> 11:57.760
I'm exhausted.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.762
Kidney failure will do that
to you.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.937
I bet.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.896
Transplant is next week
at East Mercy.

12:02.939 --> 12:05.507
I'm supposed to be resting,
keeping my stress level low.

12:05.550 --> 12:06.950
I brought you to Chicago
to cure me,

12:06.987 --> 12:07.987
not make it worse.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.255
I'm sorry.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.780
Let's go.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.741
Uh, hold on.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.481
Let me take a look at you first.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.570
I really am okay.
I have my own nephrologist.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.224
He'll make a house call.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.573
End-stage renal disease,

12:28.617 --> 12:31.707
I suspect they'll just
send you to an ED for labs.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.014
Yeah, you're probably right.
That's been the drill.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.540
All right, but I want
my doctor in the loop.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.431
I'll have my assistant
reach out to the hospital

12:40.455 --> 12:41.412
and set everything up.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.587
Works for me.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.415
I'll send someone in
to get you registered.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.289
We're gonna stay.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.470
Hey.

12:55.513 --> 12:57.559
I heard about your patient.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.822
You all right?

12:59.866 --> 13:01.693
Yeah.

13:01.737 --> 13:05.436
Emily and Bernie are here.
Bernie's not feeling well.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.612
You are up,
but I'll get another doctor

13:07.656 --> 13:09.832
if you need a few more minutes.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.529
I got it.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.488
Okay. Treatment three.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.839
Be nice.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.803
It's okay, Bernie,
we'll find something else.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.761
I know, baby.
You're so good to me.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.980
I love you.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.285
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

13:28.329 --> 13:29.547
What's going on?

13:29.591 --> 13:32.072
Emily just found
a really good apartment,

13:32.115 --> 13:34.117
but it was a little pricy.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.641
Bernie, honey, I think he's
talking about your stomach.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.819
Oh, right, yeah,
I'm, uh, I'm a little bloated.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.951
Yeah, he's got a fever too.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.867
Belly's really distended.
How long has it been this way?

13:44.911 --> 13:46.303
Couple of days.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.672
All right, well,
we'll get some labs

13:47.696 --> 13:50.438
and a CT abdomen,
then go from there.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.353
So you guys are getting
an apartment.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.746
- Trying to.
- That's good.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.357
So everything's settled
with your wife?

13:58.054 --> 14:00.361
- Ethan.
- Okay, then.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.232
I'll go put in the order
for your tests.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.237
Hey there, Vincent.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.074
I'm looking right at it.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.555
Even my father still has
a left-to-right shunt

14:20.598 --> 14:22.513
through a patent
atrial septal defect.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.341
And I'm telling you
it wasn't there

14:24.385 --> 14:26.430
after I placed
the intracardiac patch.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.955
Negative bubble test.
His post-op echo was good.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.217
I fixed the problem.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.890
- Clearly, you didn't.
- You're incredible.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.892
You've made it clear you think
I'm a horrible person.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.570
Now I'm a lousy surgeon as well?

14:35.613 --> 14:37.659
No, you're an excellent surgeon,

14:37.702 --> 14:40.531
which is why this is so glaring.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.490
I take it that's your
passive-aggressive way

14:42.533 --> 14:45.145
of saying I was careless?

14:45.188 --> 14:46.407
Or worse?

14:50.585 --> 14:52.021
However it happened,

14:52.065 --> 14:54.371
my father still needs
a repeat repair of his ASD

14:54.415 --> 14:58.071
and I am going to advise him
to have Dr. Latham perform it.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.029
At first, I thought
your attacks on me

15:00.073 --> 15:02.945
were just you blowing off
steam after we broke up.

15:02.989 --> 15:06.557
But now I really think
you're losing your mind.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.741
Gaia's body tested positive

15:16.785 --> 15:19.744
for a highly toxic substance
called thallium.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.659
There may have been traces
of it in the house

15:21.703 --> 15:23.923
where you all were staying.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.055
The good news is,
there is an antidote.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.059
Prussian blue.

15:30.103 --> 15:33.584
It stops the thallium from
being absorbed into your body.

15:33.628 --> 15:36.022
Meadow,
do you understand what...

15:36.065 --> 15:38.502
What Dr. Manning
is saying to you?

15:38.546 --> 15:40.417
Yes.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.117
Are you willing
to take the medicine?

15:47.120 --> 15:49.513
If you don't take
the Prussian blue soon,

15:49.557 --> 15:51.428
you will die from this.

15:54.605 --> 15:58.131
Will you leave me alone
if I take the pills?

15:58.174 --> 16:00.307
Promise.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.354
Okay.

16:04.398 --> 16:05.965
I-I'll take 'em.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.314
Okay.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.278
Here you go.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.769
We finally got through to her.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.423
Yeah, but why?

16:29.466 --> 16:31.164
I mean why now all of a sudden?

16:31.207 --> 16:33.296
I'll take the win.

16:35.429 --> 16:38.388
Would you do me a favor?
Keep a very close eye on her?

16:38.432 --> 16:40.651
- Sure.
- Thank you.

16:46.353 --> 16:47.745
Hey, let me ask you.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.486
What's going on
with Emily and Bernie

16:49.530 --> 16:51.184
and this hunt for an apartment?

16:51.227 --> 16:52.663
They're looking.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.883
Yeah, I heard her place
fell through, too expensive.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.667
I just hope Bernie
isn't dragging his feet.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.147
Well, Emily hasn't complained.

16:58.191 --> 17:01.107
Maybe, but she's still
sleeping at your place

17:01.150 --> 17:02.238
with the baby.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.153
- I don't mind.
- And Bernie's what?

17:04.196 --> 17:06.373
Sleeping across town
on his wife's couch?

17:06.415 --> 17:08.201
Doesn't seem to faze him a bit.

17:08.243 --> 17:11.377
Ethan, if you're thinking
of getting involved, don't.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.771
It's not gonna help.

17:13.815 --> 17:17.079
You're Bernie's doctor.
Focus on that, okay?

17:23.215 --> 17:26.696
Dr. Halstead,
this is Dr. Richard Haley.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.134
Mr. Wycoff's nephrologist.

17:28.176 --> 17:30.440
Nice to meet you.
So you'll handle the red tape?

17:30.484 --> 17:31.876
Absolutely.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.922
A VIP room is being prepared
for Mr. Wycoff

17:33.965 --> 17:35.663
as well as our conference room

17:35.706 --> 17:37.578
for you to consult
with our transplant team.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.667
I'm sorry. What's happening?

17:39.710 --> 17:41.079
Well, I didn't like
Brandon's labs.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.670
His phos is up and he's anemic.

17:42.713 --> 17:45.629
I'm moving up
his kidney transplant to today.

17:45.673 --> 17:48.110
I want him to get two units
of O-neg, stat.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.895
Whoa, whoa. Not so fast.
Mr. Wycoff's my patient.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.115
I'll handle those orders.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.682
Dr. Halstead.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.771
I appreciate you
getting the ball rolling,

17:56.814 --> 17:59.078
but Dr. Haley
is gonna take over.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.925
Miss Garrett,
I am not comfortable with this.

18:00.949 --> 18:03.101
Brandon doesn't seem to know
anything about his cousin.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.562
He's avoiding a paper trail
by paying cash,

18:05.606 --> 18:07.018
and now some doctor
we met two minutes ago

18:07.042 --> 18:09.000
is rushing him off to surgery?

18:09.044 --> 18:11.960
What about repeat labs?
Pre-op scans? HLA confirmation?

18:12.003 --> 18:13.744
It will all happen.

18:13.788 --> 18:16.791
Only now,
it's going to take place here

18:16.834 --> 18:17.922
instead of East Mercy.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.924
An easy and profitable win

18:19.968 --> 18:22.188
just fell into our laps,
Dr. Halstead.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.580
Be grateful.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.758
We're moving Mr. Wycoff
to the Ambassador Suite.

18:36.463 --> 18:37.464
It time?

18:37.507 --> 18:39.118
Not yet. Soon.

18:40.554 --> 18:43.122
Vee? Vee.

18:43.165 --> 18:46.212
Do you understand
what's happening?

18:49.171 --> 18:50.433
Oh.

18:50.477 --> 18:53.567
Um, Brandon, uh, need.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.003
I have give.

18:55.046 --> 18:59.138
You have to or want to?

19:02.489 --> 19:04.578
Dr. Manning, Dr. Charles.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.582
Monique, get me suction.

19:08.625 --> 19:09.800
Mm-hmm.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.065
I don't understand.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.869
The Prussian blue should
be making her better.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.808
It's only making her worse.

19:17.852 --> 19:20.550
It's 'cause she didn't
take the pills.

19:20.594 --> 19:21.551
Where are they?

19:21.595 --> 19:24.772
- Dr. Charles.
- Meadow, where...

19:24.815 --> 19:26.208
Monique.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.648
Meadow, without these pills,
you will die.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.303
We're supposed to die.

19:38.438 --> 19:41.963
The oceans are warming.

19:42.006 --> 19:45.009
Ice caps are melting.

19:45.053 --> 19:48.317
We're killing the planet
and no one cares.

19:52.582 --> 19:55.324
Except for us.

19:55.368 --> 19:58.197
The Angels of the Earth.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.685
"We, the Angels of the Earth,

20:08.729 --> 20:12.036
"will not be so blind to ignore
that human greed, negligence,

20:12.080 --> 20:13.908
"and abuse
are destroying the planet.

20:13.951 --> 20:18.042
We will serve the Earth
by removing ourselves from it."

20:18.086 --> 20:19.435
Oh, my God.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.413
They're a cult that believes
that Earth is destined

20:21.437 --> 20:24.527
for destruction and the only
solution is to kill themselves.

20:24.571 --> 20:27.008
At least they're not making
it all up out of thin air.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.290
Each one of their claims
is linked

20:28.314 --> 20:31.230
to a legitimate
scientific study.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.232
Yeah, I know,
but their whole manifesto

20:33.275 --> 20:35.146
is still one big suicide note.

20:35.190 --> 20:37.061
Well, at least you can
put her on a psych hold

20:37.105 --> 20:38.193
and we can force treatment.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.629
No, no, no, we can't.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.893
Look, a psych hold just means
we can keep her here

20:42.937 --> 20:44.721
so she doesn't harm
herself more.

20:44.765 --> 20:47.246
It still doesn't mean we can
make her take Prussian blue

20:47.289 --> 20:50.074
or undo the things
she's done to herself

20:50.118 --> 20:52.555
unless she wants us to.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.253
So what can we do?

20:54.296 --> 20:57.908
Well, it's a long shot,
but I could petition a court

20:57.952 --> 20:59.736
to deem her mentally incompetent

20:59.780 --> 21:01.651
because of the brainwashing
she's received

21:01.695 --> 21:03.131
at the hands of this cult.

21:03.174 --> 21:06.003
If not, Meadow controls
her own fate.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.273
I just got word your patient's

21:14.316 --> 21:15.883
gonna be admitted
and moved upstairs

21:15.926 --> 21:18.015
to meet with transplant.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.325
Mags.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.327
I need you to stall
the transfer.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.242
I'm waiting on calls
from translators.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.505
Gwen Garrett called me
personally on this one.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.333
I can buy you
maybe half an hour.

21:31.377 --> 21:34.075
That's not gonna do it. Damn it!

21:34.118 --> 21:35.903
Okay, let's get a head CT.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.426
- Will!
- Due diligence.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.123
I'm just making sure
there's not a delayed

21:39.167 --> 21:41.648
subdural hematoma that might
endanger Vee in surgery.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.956
This case smells that funky?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.002
It smells illegal.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.923
Okay, I'll order you the CT.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.141
You got an hour now.

21:57.185 --> 22:00.667
But if I were you,
I'd find a plan B.

22:00.710 --> 22:04.279
Yeah, I need Miss Goodwin.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.107
Dr. Latham,
how'd it go with my father?

22:06.150 --> 22:07.238
- No problems.
- Good.

22:07.282 --> 22:08.631
So, uh, what was it?

22:08.675 --> 22:10.764
Was the intracardiac patch
not sewn in properly

22:10.807 --> 22:12.461
or did the sutures come loose?

22:12.505 --> 22:14.985
Neither, the patch itself
was faulty.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.335
The patch?

22:16.378 --> 22:19.207
So there was no error
on Dr. Bekker's part.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.252
Absolutely not.

22:21.296 --> 22:24.125
Her sutures were placed
perfectly, as always.

22:29.609 --> 22:32.351
So, Bernie,
I've got your CT results.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.614
You have a complete
small bowel obstruction.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.572
Likely caused by adhesions
related

22:36.616 --> 22:39.488
to your pancreatic pseudocyst
surgery.

22:39.532 --> 22:40.576
Wow, uh...

22:40.620 --> 22:42.970
I've got an OR
prepped for you now.

22:43.013 --> 22:45.146
What about recovery time?

22:45.189 --> 22:46.669
A few days in the hospital,

22:46.713 --> 22:48.758
then another week or two
of bed rest.

22:48.802 --> 22:52.196
Honey, we'll have to put
a hold on our job

22:52.240 --> 22:53.589
and apartment search.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.330
Of course,
your health comes first.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.897
And I'll call Ashley
and let her know

22:56.940 --> 22:59.421
I'm gonna be there a bit longer.

22:59.465 --> 23:02.206
It's all gonna work out.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.904
How, Bernie?

23:05.471 --> 23:07.603
How is everything
gonna work out?

23:07.647 --> 23:11.041
Without a job?
Without a place to live?

23:12.695 --> 23:14.436
Can't you see how hard
this is on Emily?

23:14.480 --> 23:15.829
Not to mention her baby?

23:17.221 --> 23:18.745
For reasons I may
never understand,

23:18.788 --> 23:21.138
Emily loves you
with all of her heart.

23:21.182 --> 23:24.054
So start showing her
you feel the same way.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.882
Get it together.

23:25.926 --> 23:28.102
Mr. Kim? I'm Dr. Wilde.

23:28.145 --> 23:30.060
We're here to take you
to pre-op holding.

23:30.104 --> 23:31.845
Let's go.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.729
The black market?

23:46.773 --> 23:49.471
You think Mr. Wycoff is buying
your patient's kidney?

23:49.515 --> 23:50.951
Wouldn't be the first.

23:50.994 --> 23:53.432
World Health Organization
estimates that 7,000 kidneys

23:53.475 --> 23:55.912
are illegally harvested
annually.

23:55.956 --> 23:58.175
I have other reports
from human rights groups,

23:58.219 --> 23:59.742
economic equality firms.

23:59.786 --> 24:01.222
All right.

24:01.265 --> 24:04.312
"Buyers of trafficked organs
are high-income individuals

24:04.355 --> 24:05.574
"from developed countries.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.185
"The typical seller is male,
around 29,

24:08.229 --> 24:10.057
and from some of the world's
poorest areas."

24:10.100 --> 24:11.885
I mean, this is Brandon and Vee.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.278
Yes, they fit the profile,
and I'm well aware

24:14.322 --> 24:17.151
of the magnitude
of illegal organ transplants.

24:17.194 --> 24:20.633
But this is Brandon's file
from East Mercy.

24:20.676 --> 24:24.593
Uh, transplant list status
as well as Vee's donor papers.

24:24.637 --> 24:27.509
Our lawyers have been
all over these documents.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.729
Nothing appears out of place.

24:29.772 --> 24:32.383
And what about
the nephrologist, Dr. Haley?

24:32.427 --> 24:34.255
Privileges at hospitals
across the city,

24:34.298 --> 24:36.300
including ours.

24:36.344 --> 24:37.780
So Brandon's covered his bases.

24:37.824 --> 24:40.087
That doesn't mean
money hasn't changed hands.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.524
Miss Goodwin, I'm telling you,

24:42.568 --> 24:45.614
there's something going on here.

24:55.232 --> 24:58.018
This is the mission statement
of the Angels of the Earth.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.196
I've read it three times now.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.982
Are you beginning
to understand, then?

25:06.026 --> 25:07.331
I'm trying to.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.159
As a scientist, I agree.

25:09.203 --> 25:11.684
But I'm having a hard time
believing that the planet

25:11.727 --> 25:13.555
is doomed
to become uninhabitable.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.993
Or how poisoning yourself
with thallium will change that.

25:17.037 --> 25:21.781
Would you have heard of the
Angels of the Earth otherwise

25:21.824 --> 25:23.347
if I wasn't here?

25:23.391 --> 25:25.219
So you're a martyr?

25:29.310 --> 25:33.183
In 1963,
a monk set himself on fire

25:33.227 --> 25:36.535
in protest
of the Vietnamese government's

25:36.578 --> 25:40.669
discriminatory laws
against Buddhism.

25:40.713 --> 25:43.977
The government was overthrown.

25:44.020 --> 25:45.544
Is that your hope?

25:45.587 --> 25:48.938
That the government
is overthrown?

25:48.982 --> 25:50.287
No.

25:50.331 --> 25:54.683
My... my hope is that people
wake up and take action

25:54.727 --> 25:58.252
instead of continuing
to cook our planet

25:58.295 --> 26:00.907
by burning fossil fuels.

26:00.950 --> 26:04.214
So then you believe
the planet can be saved.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.521
You're twisting my words.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.044
- I'm not.
- Mm-hmm.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.916
Your logic is flawed.

26:09.959 --> 26:11.613
You want people to change,

26:11.657 --> 26:14.442
but you also think that change
will be meaningless.

26:14.485 --> 26:16.487
So what is the point
of martyring yourself

26:16.531 --> 26:18.402
if it's unclear
what you stand for?

26:23.320 --> 26:27.237
I-I'm not taking your pills.

26:29.762 --> 26:33.287
Meadow, your hair
is falling out.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.419
You're running out of time.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.073
Good.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.555
I am not gonna let you die.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.731
Monique, John?

26:42.775 --> 26:45.429
Put her in the soft restraints,
then prepare for an NG tube.

26:45.473 --> 26:46.866
I'm giving her
the Prussian blue.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.345
No!

26:48.389 --> 26:50.609
Maybe I should call Dr. Charles.

26:50.652 --> 26:51.871
I'm a licensed physician,

26:51.914 --> 26:54.003
and I am deeming the patient
nondecisional.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.744
Put her in the restraints.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.093
Now.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.747
No! No, you can't do that!

26:58.791 --> 27:00.488
I'm sorry.

27:00.531 --> 27:01.620
You can't!

27:01.663 --> 27:04.579
No, please!

27:04.623 --> 27:07.408
You can't do this! No!

27:07.451 --> 27:08.627
Stop.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.377
I have to ask you.

27:20.421 --> 27:24.033
Is Brandon paying
for your kidney?

27:33.347 --> 27:34.740
Money. All right?

27:34.783 --> 27:39.614
Is Brandon paying you money
for your kidney?

27:39.658 --> 27:43.444
No, uh... no money.

27:45.402 --> 27:47.491
It's okay.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.232
Just tell me the truth
so I can help.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.757
Help? Uh, yes.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.197
Ah.

28:03.594 --> 28:04.987
Me.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.511
Brandon.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.209
Uh-huh.

28:11.167 --> 28:14.170
Brandon sick.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.520
I help family.

28:21.525 --> 28:24.746
Dr. Halstead?
Is there a problem?

28:24.790 --> 28:26.530
No, just checking on Vee.

28:26.574 --> 28:28.576
Making sure he's okay.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.796
Me too.

28:30.839 --> 28:34.408
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.109
Look at us.

28:44.374 --> 28:47.551
My mom took me to Moldova
when I was eight.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.553
She wanted me to experience
the homeland.

28:49.597 --> 28:54.080
And village after village,
I was so bored.

28:54.123 --> 28:57.866
But then on the last day,
I met Vee.

28:57.910 --> 29:00.739
And we couldn't speak
to each other,

29:00.782 --> 29:02.741
but we both knew
how to play soccer.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.003
Football.

29:04.046 --> 29:05.700
Football, football.
I... football.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.748
Hmm?

29:14.187 --> 29:16.450
Thank you for what
you're doing for me.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.978
You're saving my life.

29:25.894 --> 29:29.028
I wish he knew
what I was saying.

29:30.856 --> 29:33.075
I think he does.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.733
I'll leave you guys alone.

29:46.959 --> 29:50.789
I have gifted millions
to this hospital.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.791
I expect first-class care.

29:52.834 --> 29:55.881
Connor, get in here.
You should hear this.

29:55.924 --> 29:58.622
A budget bloated with waste,

29:58.666 --> 30:00.066
and what is
Miss Garrett's solution,

30:00.102 --> 30:05.064
is to save money
on intracardiac patches.

30:05.107 --> 30:08.415
Again, Mr. Rhodes,
I sincerely apologize.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.939
I will personally look into

30:10.983 --> 30:13.115
how these patches
ended up in the OR

30:13.159 --> 30:15.596
and I will make sure
that it never happens again.

30:15.639 --> 30:18.338
Full report next board meeting.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.906
Of course.

30:20.949 --> 30:24.126
And Gwen... if memory serves,

30:24.170 --> 30:28.435
your contract extension is also
an agenda item at that meeting.

30:31.351 --> 30:33.657
I believe it is.

30:33.701 --> 30:36.704
Perfect. See you there.

30:46.148 --> 30:49.108
Hey, uh, just got an update.
Bernie's surgery went well.

30:49.151 --> 30:52.067
He'll be out soon.
That seat's taken.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.113
And that seat's taken too.

30:54.156 --> 30:57.986
Okay, I get it.
You're mad at me.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.988
Why'd you yell at Bernie
like that?

31:00.032 --> 31:01.685
I was sticking up for you.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.252
You were kicking him
when he's down.

31:03.296 --> 31:04.969
Everything I said,
Bernie needed to hear,

31:04.993 --> 31:06.386
and you were never gonna say it.

31:06.429 --> 31:09.911
Yes, I want an apartment.
I want him to get a job.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.652
But tough love
won't get us there.

31:11.695 --> 31:14.524
And coddling does?

31:14.568 --> 31:16.135
Miss Choi?

31:16.178 --> 31:18.528
Mr. Kim's being moved
to the ICU for recovery.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.574
Whenever you're ready,
you can go down and see him.

31:20.617 --> 31:21.880
Thanks, Lizzie.

31:24.273 --> 31:27.363
You don't get it.
Bernie's delicate.

31:27.407 --> 31:28.930
He's warm, affectionate,

31:28.974 --> 31:30.584
and he needs encouragement
and support.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.499
And if you can't
get behind that,

31:32.542 --> 31:35.154
then get out of our lives.

31:38.766 --> 31:42.509
Dr. Charles? I need you.

31:50.952 --> 31:53.650
What the hell were you thinking?

31:53.694 --> 31:55.063
You could lose
your license for this.

31:55.087 --> 31:57.176
- For doing what's right?
- For breaking the law!

31:57.219 --> 31:59.613
I don't want her
to die either, Natalie,

31:59.656 --> 32:02.094
but the woman has rights!

32:02.137 --> 32:03.922
What are you going to do?

32:03.965 --> 32:05.247
Well, now that
you've boxed me in,

32:05.271 --> 32:06.837
there's only one thing
that I can do.

32:06.881 --> 32:08.056
If you take out that tube,

32:08.100 --> 32:09.579
the only thing you will be doing

32:09.623 --> 32:13.061
is pushing Meadow
one step closer to death.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.455
Get out of my way.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.945
Okay, this is gonna
be uncomfortable.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.080
Sorry about that.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.434
I apologize for Dr. Manning.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.915
It... it's hard for her
to understand

32:40.959 --> 32:42.699
why you're doing this.

32:47.226 --> 32:49.489
I thought you'd want
to know that, um,

32:49.532 --> 32:51.491
because of your friend's deaths,

32:51.534 --> 32:55.321
everybody is talking about
Angels of the Earth right now.

32:55.364 --> 32:57.845
I mean, the Internet's
going crazy.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.021
We knew it would.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.718
So thallium, huh?

33:01.762 --> 33:02.850
Clever.

33:02.893 --> 33:06.506
A chemical compound
not found in nature.

33:06.549 --> 33:09.683
A poison that deteriorates
the body in much the same way

33:09.726 --> 33:11.990
that climate change
affects the Earth.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.643
It's poetic.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.950
You're smart.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.170
You know,
you've gotten pretty much

33:18.213 --> 33:19.954
everything you wanted.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.392
And all that's left now
is to wait?

33:23.436 --> 33:25.525
I think you've suffered
enough, Meadow.

33:25.568 --> 33:27.701
And I'd like to help ease
that transition

33:27.744 --> 33:32.140
and give you a couple of
sleeping pills if you let me.

33:33.794 --> 33:37.667
Suffering is the point.

33:37.711 --> 33:39.974
Look, Gaia put a bag
over her head.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.671
There is no one on the Internet

33:41.715 --> 33:43.586
calling her out
for taking a shortcut.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.197
Trust me.

33:48.374 --> 33:50.550
It's just a thought.

33:58.601 --> 34:00.995
Okay.

34:05.478 --> 34:08.219
I'll take the sleeping pills.

34:10.699 --> 34:12.614
Good.

34:19.579 --> 34:23.626
Give Meadow 5 of eszopiclone.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.585
It's okay.

34:31.504 --> 34:34.768
Meadow has agreed
to take eszopiclone.

34:34.811 --> 34:37.248
Once she's out, she will
no longer have the ability

34:37.292 --> 34:39.251
to advocate for herself.

34:39.293 --> 34:40.904
And a strong legal case
could be made

34:40.947 --> 34:44.168
that we then have the right
to act under implied consent

34:44.212 --> 34:47.781
as surrogate decision-makers
on her behalf.

34:47.824 --> 34:51.567
So you can replace the NG tube
and administer Prussian blue.

35:09.324 --> 35:11.109
- Ava, hold up.
- Leave me alone, Connor.

35:11.152 --> 35:14.155
Look, I am sorry for
jumping to conclusions earlier.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.741
I should have considered
the possibility

35:15.765 --> 35:18.681
that the patch failed before
placing all the blame on you.

35:18.725 --> 35:20.944
And?

35:22.120 --> 35:23.773
And what?

35:23.817 --> 35:25.384
Seriously, Connor?

35:25.427 --> 35:27.255
Accusing me of botching
your father's surgery

35:27.299 --> 35:29.997
is the only conclusion
you're sorry for?

35:31.520 --> 35:34.523
What about your claim
that I slept with him?

35:34.567 --> 35:36.612
That I manipulated
the oversight committee?

35:36.656 --> 35:39.049
That I let you cut my hand
in surgery?

35:39.093 --> 35:40.703
And God knows what else.

35:40.747 --> 35:44.751
No apology
for any of that madness.

35:44.794 --> 35:45.795
I'll be honest.

35:45.839 --> 35:50.365
When we broke up,
I was devastated.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.019
And I'm still getting over it.

35:52.062 --> 35:55.718
But at no point
have I cast you as a monster.

35:55.762 --> 35:58.808
So why do you insist
on making me one?

36:01.724 --> 36:04.205
Why do you want
to hurt me so badly?

36:15.738 --> 36:19.177
You're such a good baby.
Yes, you are.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.834
Hey, Bernie.

36:29.578 --> 36:32.451
Um, Bernie, look...

36:35.018 --> 36:37.020
I was out of line earlier.

36:41.286 --> 36:43.592
I appreciate you
saying that, Ethan.

36:45.420 --> 36:50.164
Now on, if you need anything...

36:50.208 --> 36:53.776
I want you to know you can come
to me, no questions asked.

36:56.823 --> 37:01.741
Em, do you mind if I, uh,
have a moment alone with Ethan?

37:01.784 --> 37:03.786
Okay. We'll be right outside.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.615
Let's go outside.
Let's go outside.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.582
You were right, Ethan.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.715
I better step it up,
and I'm going to.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.151
I promise.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.851
I'm glad to hear that.

37:24.894 --> 37:28.289
There is, uh, one thing
you can help me out with.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.161
Name it.

37:31.205 --> 37:34.295
Lately, I've been having trouble

37:34.339 --> 37:37.429
sustaining an erection.

37:37.472 --> 37:38.604
What?

37:38.647 --> 37:40.736
It's called
erectile dysfunction,

37:40.780 --> 37:46.612
and there's medication that...
That can possibly help.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.701
I'm reluctant to write you
a prescription.

37:48.744 --> 37:51.704
You should really talk
to a urologist.

37:54.663 --> 37:58.363
Thank you.
Thanks for everything, Ethan.

38:09.243 --> 38:10.723
Dr. Charles...

38:12.638 --> 38:14.248
I know you're upset with me.

38:14.292 --> 38:18.731
But I just wanted to thank you
for what you did today.

38:18.774 --> 38:21.081
We prevented a suicide.

38:21.124 --> 38:22.778
Have we, though?

38:22.822 --> 38:25.346
I mean, two doses of
Prussian blue won't be enough

38:25.390 --> 38:26.347
to neutralize the thallium.

38:26.391 --> 38:29.045
She's gonna need dozens more.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.656
When Meadow wakes up
tomorrow morning,

38:30.699 --> 38:32.353
the battle to get her
to take them,

38:32.397 --> 38:34.007
it starts all over,
and I'm just worried

38:34.050 --> 38:36.836
that... we haven't really
prevented a suicide

38:36.879 --> 38:40.361
as much as we've postponed one.

38:43.103 --> 38:46.628
Natalie, um...

38:46.672 --> 38:49.675
this is the second time
in as many months

38:49.718 --> 38:53.679
that you've, um,
well, you've misstepped,

38:53.722 --> 38:57.160
and I'm just wondering, is...
Is everything okay?

38:58.553 --> 39:00.468
Yeah.

39:00.512 --> 39:02.296
Okay.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.386
Well, um,
I will see you tomorrow.

39:22.098 --> 39:23.230
Hey, Phillip.

39:23.273 --> 39:25.058
Oh, hey.

39:25.101 --> 39:26.407
Waiting on Natalie?

39:26.451 --> 39:29.715
Yeah, she's picking Owen up
from daycare.

39:29.758 --> 39:33.501
Look, man, if I seemed
weird earlier, I'm sorry.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.329
What do you mean?

39:35.373 --> 39:39.942
I was just thrown when you
mentioned your ranch to Owen.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.597
I'm so sorry,
when I mentioned my...

39:42.641 --> 39:44.556
Your ranch.

39:44.599 --> 39:47.036
Oh, yeah. That.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.561
Well, look, uh,
the kid loves horses.

39:49.604 --> 39:52.259
I was just playing.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.740
So you don't own a ranch.

39:54.783 --> 39:58.439
No. No.

39:58.483 --> 39:59.571
Oh.

39:59.614 --> 40:01.703
But I figured that...

40:01.747 --> 40:04.576
Owen got a pretty big kick
out of it, right?

40:04.619 --> 40:07.448
Yeah, I guess.

40:10.495 --> 40:11.670
I'll see you around.

40:11.713 --> 40:14.412
Yeah, take care.
