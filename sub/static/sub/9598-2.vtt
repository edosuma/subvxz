00:09.514 --> 00:10.823
<i>Maura.</i>

00:11.418 --> 00:14.410
- Sweetheart.
- Good morning, Angela.

00:14.444 --> 00:17.246
- Hi.
- How you doing?

00:17.314 --> 00:20.716
Oh, I don't know.

00:20.784 --> 00:25.654
- [sighs] I don't know.
- Go ahead, Maura. Let it out.

00:27.090 --> 00:30.159
I'll get us some coffee.

00:30.193 --> 00:35.130
A tragic accident like that...

00:35.165 --> 00:38.033
you never really see it coming.

00:39.836 --> 00:42.938
[inhales deeply]
I am worried about Jane.

00:42.972 --> 00:45.774
Her and Barry were so close, and...

00:45.842 --> 00:48.310
well, with the pregnancy
and all those hormones ...

00:48.378 --> 00:49.778
Shh! Shh.

00:49.846 --> 00:51.347
Jane doesn't know that you know

00:51.381 --> 00:53.749
and she hasn't told anyone
else, so you need to just ...

00:53.783 --> 00:56.419
I know.
Keep my trap shut. I will.

00:56.586 --> 00:58.821
Doesn't mean that a mother can't worry.

00:58.855 --> 01:01.991
She's always been so good
about sympathizing with others.

01:02.025 --> 01:05.861
But when it comes to her own feelings,
she bottles everything up.

01:05.929 --> 01:09.598
She needs to let it out.
So do you.

01:09.633 --> 01:12.601
You need a good cry, a big cry.

01:12.669 --> 01:14.503
We will. In time.

01:14.538 --> 01:17.606
- Dabda.
- Gesundheit?

01:17.641 --> 01:22.778
The stages of grief.
Denial, anger, bargaining,

01:22.812 --> 01:24.613
depression, acceptance.

01:24.648 --> 01:26.749
It's from Elisabeth
Kubler-Ross' seminal work

01:26.783 --> 01:28.851
in the mid-20th century.

01:28.885 --> 01:30.619
Though current research
shows that yearning

01:30.654 --> 01:32.988
is actually a more accurate
expression of the final ...

01:33.023 --> 01:36.192
Okay. That all sounds great.
When's the crying start?

01:38.195 --> 01:41.597
- Hey. Morning, Ma.
- Hi, honey.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.034
Thanks for letting me
stay over last night.

01:45.068 --> 01:47.636
No problem. I didn't
want to be alone, either.

01:47.671 --> 01:50.906
- Where you going?
- To the station.

01:50.941 --> 01:52.608
Don't you think it would be better

01:52.642 --> 01:57.146
- to stay home and feel your feelings?
- Ma, he loved his work.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.915
He wouldn't want me to just
curl up and stop doing mine.

01:59.950 --> 02:01.917
I don't think that's what
your mom's suggesting.

02:01.952 --> 02:04.653
Maybe ... maybe you can sit
down, have a cup of coffee?

02:04.688 --> 02:06.789
<i>Real coffee.</i>

02:06.823 --> 02:10.292
- I can make us all some breakfast.
- I'll take the coffee.

02:10.327 --> 02:11.927
Oh, uh...

02:11.962 --> 02:16.765
Thanks.
See you later.

02:16.833 --> 02:20.002
- Wasn't that your vase?
- [door opens] Yep.

02:20.036 --> 02:23.072
Denial. [door closes]
Check.

02:52.769 --> 02:55.638
[sighs]

03:01.144 --> 03:02.846
Good morning.

03:03.613 --> 03:05.614
What are you doing here?

03:07.451 --> 03:09.919
I have dealt with hundreds of homicides

03:09.953 --> 03:11.787
and the grieving relatives
that go with them.

03:11.855 --> 03:13.189
- I can deal with this.
- Really?

03:13.223 --> 03:15.791
Because you had coffee
in your pencil holder.

03:15.859 --> 03:18.094
It's not a pencil holder.
Maura was messing with me.

03:18.128 --> 03:21.764
- Go home.
- [sighs] No.

03:21.798 --> 03:23.799
Maybe I wasn't clear.
I'm ordering you to go home.

03:23.834 --> 03:25.634
- You're ordering me?
- Yes.

03:25.669 --> 03:27.436
We don't have a case we're working on.

03:27.471 --> 03:29.071
I'm the sergeant
detective of this squad.

03:29.106 --> 03:31.032
- I have the authority to send you home.
- Oh, if you think I'm gonna

03:31.189 --> 03:32.217
- If I think you're not ...
- let you pull rank on me,

03:32.401 --> 03:34.293
- it's not ...
- Jane?

03:34.611 --> 03:36.045
Mrs. Frost.

03:36.079 --> 03:39.171
[sniffles] I'm sorry to interrupt.
[voice breaking] I...

03:39.172 --> 03:43.605
- I just didn't know where else to go.
- [sniffling] Uh... okay...

03:44.971 --> 03:47.072
[crying]

03:47.107 --> 03:49.875
I'm so sorry.

03:52.145 --> 03:55.335
<i>And then the funeral
director started asking me</i>

03:55.370 --> 03:57.719
all these questions like
did I want a viewing,

03:57.754 --> 03:59.952
should Barry wear his uniform,

03:59.986 --> 04:02.688
<i>what kind of music should they play.</i>

04:02.722 --> 04:05.858
And I realized... I don't know.

04:05.925 --> 04:09.328
- How could you?
- A couple of years ago, Barry sat me down

04:09.396 --> 04:12.731
and had me tell him what
I wanted at my service.

04:12.766 --> 04:15.234
It never dawned on me to ask about his.

04:15.268 --> 04:18.170
[voice breaking] He was just so young.

04:18.204 --> 04:21.874
Would you like us to take
care of the service for you?

04:23.677 --> 04:26.045
[sighs]
I couldn't ask you to do that.

04:26.079 --> 04:28.647
You didn't ask.
I volunteered.

04:28.682 --> 04:31.050
Even his father can't get here.
H-he's on a ship

04:31.051 --> 04:33.919
doing a support mission
in the middle of the Pacific.

04:33.953 --> 04:38.157
So... it would mean so
much if you could help.

04:38.191 --> 04:41.994
We'd be honored.

04:42.028 --> 04:43.996
And of course we'll,
uh, keep you in the loop

04:44.030 --> 04:47.299
- on all the preparations.
- Well...

04:47.334 --> 04:50.135
nobody knew my son
better than you all did,

04:50.170 --> 04:53.465
so whatever you decide,
I know it will be perfect.

04:53.533 --> 04:56.829
Just what Barry would have wanted.

04:59.728 --> 05:03.412
- Well, now you got a reason to go home.
- Vince, come on.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.915
Please don't pull rank on me now, okay?

05:05.949 --> 05:07.550
I know your heart is in the right...

05:10.153 --> 05:11.320
Gun!

05:11.354 --> 05:12.922
[guns cock]
Put your weapon down.

05:12.989 --> 05:14.323
- Put it down.
- Help me.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.992
We'll help you as soon
as you give us that gun.

05:23.300 --> 05:27.236
- What's your name?
- I-I don't know.

05:27.270 --> 05:29.071
Okay.
What kind of help do you need?

05:31.274 --> 05:34.243
[voice breaking] I killed someone.

05:34.277 --> 05:38.080
- Who?
- I don't know that, either.

05:42.152 --> 05:44.283
[handcuffs click]
Well, I guess we got a case now.

05:54.193 --> 05:55.360
How did you get here?

05:55.395 --> 06:02.067
I, um... I walked by
the deli, dry cleaner,

06:02.135 --> 06:06.371
and then I saw a policeman walk
in here, so I-I followed him.

06:06.406 --> 06:11.510
- How about before that?
- I-I don't know.

06:11.544 --> 06:14.312
- What city are we in?
- Boston.

06:14.380 --> 06:18.083
- What's your favorite baseball team?
- Red Sox.

06:18.117 --> 06:20.085
<i>You said you killed someone.</i>

06:20.119 --> 06:22.254
Did that happen in the day or the night?

06:22.288 --> 06:25.090
I-I don't ... I don't know.

06:25.158 --> 06:27.192
[elevator bell dings]

06:29.996 --> 06:33.131
We just need it high enough
so I can remove her clothes in private.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.269
That was very considerate.

06:37.303 --> 06:39.104
I'd hate to have to testify
on why we undressed her

06:39.138 --> 06:40.539
in front of the entire
Boston police force.

06:40.573 --> 06:42.040
<i>Amanda: Doctor?</i>

06:42.075 --> 06:44.101
Uh, after we've collected
the clothing, take

06:44.102 --> 06:46.127
the tarp to evidence
and make sure we process

06:46.193 --> 06:48.246
- everything that fell off.
- Mm-hmm.

06:48.281 --> 06:51.883
Amanda's gonna remove your
clothes and your shoes.

06:51.918 --> 06:54.853
<i>And we have scrubs and
shoes for you to put on.</i>

06:54.887 --> 06:57.089
<i>If you're cold, I can give
you a reflective blanket.</i>

06:57.123 --> 06:58.623
O-okay.

07:04.664 --> 07:07.534
I'm not going home.

07:08.968 --> 07:11.970
Planning a funeral takes a lot of time.

07:12.004 --> 07:14.039
She might have committed
a murder or not.

07:14.073 --> 07:16.007
He would have wanted
me to stay on the job

07:16.042 --> 07:17.309
and figure out what happened.

07:17.343 --> 07:19.311
Have you noticed that
you won't say his name?

07:21.280 --> 07:22.981
Barry Frost.

07:23.015 --> 07:26.284
- There. You happy, Dr. Freud?
- Well, freud actually believed

07:26.319 --> 07:28.653
that everything was related to
some repressed sexual desire.

07:28.688 --> 07:30.489
I do not think that is the reason

07:30.523 --> 07:32.891
that you will not say
Detective Frost's name.

07:32.925 --> 07:35.193
I have to figure out who she is.
I will talk to you later.

07:35.228 --> 07:39.131
Probably shouldn't have said that.

07:39.465 --> 07:41.299
[sighs]
All his years on the force,

07:41.334 --> 07:43.935
he's entitled to the
pomp and circumstance,

07:43.970 --> 07:45.854
even if he didn't die
in the line of duty.

07:45.897 --> 07:49.330
Hey. I heard about Frost.
It's a real shame.

07:49.840 --> 07:55.079
- He was a good man.
- Yeah, he was. Thanks.

07:57.558 --> 07:59.225
Look, I know everybody means well,

07:59.260 --> 08:01.528
but that's gonna be real
tough to do 200 times today.

08:01.562 --> 08:05.198
[sighs] And, yes, of
course he deserves it.

08:05.232 --> 08:08.468
Frost deserves a cop's funeral.

08:08.502 --> 08:11.571
But if we go full pageant,
then it becomes a photo op.

08:11.605 --> 08:14.307
If it becomes a photo op,
then everyone shows up ...

08:14.341 --> 08:18.545
- the Cardinal, the Mayor.
- Frost hated the Mayor.

08:18.579 --> 08:21.614
He wrote in Bill "spaceman" Lee
instead of voting for him.

08:23.117 --> 08:25.952
Exactly.

08:25.986 --> 08:29.489
Let's keep what Frost liked
and ditch what he hated.

08:29.523 --> 08:34.460
So no to the Mayor and...

08:34.495 --> 08:38.565
- yes to bagpipes.
- How did he feel about "Danny boy"?

08:38.599 --> 08:43.203
Yes to bagpipes, no to "Danny boy."
You be in charge of the music.

08:43.236 --> 08:46.472
- I don't know anything about music.
- You want to do the eulogy?

08:47.641 --> 08:50.710
- You're good with music?
- Hey, I volunteered for pictures.

08:50.744 --> 08:52.478
Oh, I'm no good at pictures either.

08:52.513 --> 08:56.052
Well, why don't you just let me know
when you decide what you're least bad at?

08:57.953 --> 08:59.883
Hey Jane. Your woman's
fingerprints are a bust.

08:59.950 --> 09:03.353
She wasn't in the database.
But her gun was recently fired.

09:03.421 --> 09:05.488
Any dead bodies lying in the street

09:05.523 --> 09:07.490
that are in need of
a suspect to go with them?

09:07.525 --> 09:10.394
- Wouldn't that be convenient?
- Well, missing-persons' reports

09:10.395 --> 09:11.261
- matching her description?
- No.

09:11.295 --> 09:13.763
Uninvestigated gunshots
anywhere in the greater

09:13.764 --> 09:14.497
- Boston area?
- Oh, come on.

09:14.565 --> 09:16.416
We all know she's faking
amnesia to set up

09:16.417 --> 09:18.268
a mental-incapacitation
defense for a murder trial.

09:18.302 --> 09:21.455
Probably.
But she was covered in blood

09:21.456 --> 09:22.839
and had no visible injuries.

09:22.873 --> 09:25.041
I mean, based on volume
alone, someone is dead

09:25.076 --> 09:27.911
or going to be soon
if we don't find them.

09:27.945 --> 09:30.347
[beep] No shots. At least
not that shot alert picked up.

09:30.381 --> 09:32.182
Okay. Let's get her
picture to all roll calls,

09:32.216 --> 09:35.085
see if we can track her in
the homeland security cameras.

09:35.119 --> 09:39.889
You all know Roger Wise, the
department grief counselor.

09:39.924 --> 09:42.926
<i>Roger: I was very sorry to
hear about Detective Frost.</i>

09:42.960 --> 09:45.161
I'm here to help any way I can.

09:45.196 --> 09:47.831
So, I can't force any
of you to talk to Roger

09:47.865 --> 09:50.951
about this tragic auto accident.
But I can force you to sit

09:50.952 --> 09:53.503
with him for 30 minutes,
talk about anything you like.

09:53.537 --> 09:57.574
- So, who's first?
- I-I got to distribute the photo.

09:57.608 --> 10:02.512
- I got to check out the cameras.
- I'll, uh...

10:02.546 --> 10:04.948
Thanks for volunteering, detective.

10:05.015 --> 10:08.118
Takes a strong man to
open up about his feelings.

10:13.290 --> 10:17.327
Dr. Maura Isles initiating
the examination of...

10:17.361 --> 10:20.430
I-I don't want to call you "Jane Doe"

10:20.464 --> 10:22.432
because that's what
I call the other women

10:22.466 --> 10:27.370
who end up on this table who are...
less alive than you.

10:27.405 --> 10:30.974
So, based on the
flounce hem of your skirt

10:31.008 --> 10:34.310
and the elasticity of your skin,
I'd say you're in your mid-20s.

10:34.345 --> 10:38.114
The most popular baby name
25 years ago was Jessica.

10:38.149 --> 10:39.983
Okay. [beep]

10:40.017 --> 10:41.518
Maura Isles initiating the examination

10:41.585 --> 10:46.990
of Jessica Doe, female caucasian.
Approximate age is 25.

10:47.057 --> 10:49.426
I'm sorry to be talking
as if you weren't here.

10:49.460 --> 10:52.896
It's okay.
You're trying to help me, right?

10:52.930 --> 10:55.532
Uh, well, I'm ...

10:55.566 --> 10:58.868
I'm trying to find out
what happened to you.

10:58.936 --> 11:00.437
I'm going to take
scrapings to see if there's

11:00.471 --> 11:02.505
any tissues underneath your fingernails.

11:05.075 --> 11:09.245
- So, you like the Red Sox?
- Yeah.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.882
- Do you have a favorite player?
- Dustin Pedroia.

11:12.917 --> 11:15.418
Most defensive runs saved at his
position over the last three years.

11:15.453 --> 11:19.355
- He's got a nice smile.
- Yes, he does.

11:21.492 --> 11:26.429
When I was at BCU,
my roommate took me to a game,

11:26.464 --> 11:29.132
and it was the best hot dog I ever had.

11:29.166 --> 11:33.903
- It's the mustard.
- I didn't know that.

11:33.938 --> 11:37.607
Been to a game recently?

11:42.613 --> 11:45.315
[voice breaking] I don't know.

11:47.051 --> 11:51.521
It's okay.
I am going to floss your teeth.

11:51.589 --> 11:54.324
If you could just open
your mouth for me, please.

11:56.994 --> 11:59.295
I wonder what's in that mustard.

11:59.330 --> 12:01.698
Camera tracks her down
Tremont to Columbus.

12:01.732 --> 12:04.567
Then she heads onto the bike
path, Southwest corridor,

12:04.602 --> 12:06.569
and that's it 'cause the cameras stop.

12:06.604 --> 12:10.139
Okay. Well, I got a hit
on the gun registration.

12:10.174 --> 12:11.441
The owner reported it
stolen three years ago

12:11.509 --> 12:13.443
<i>and doesn't know our woman.</i>

12:13.511 --> 12:16.112
I finished my live autopsy.

12:16.146 --> 12:17.714
Well, technically it can't be
an autopsy because that is,

12:17.748 --> 12:20.149
by definition, an examination
of a body after death.

12:20.184 --> 12:23.319
Although I could be using the
word in the spirit of autopsia,

12:23.387 --> 12:25.922
from the Greek, meaning
"to see with one's own eyes..."

12:27.091 --> 12:29.659
- Anyway. Jessica ...
- Who's Jessica?

12:29.693 --> 12:31.361
The woman from the lobby.

12:31.428 --> 12:33.730
Oh, no, Korsak.
Maura's named her.

12:33.797 --> 12:35.665
Now we'll never be
able to give her back.

12:35.699 --> 12:37.467
<i>Maura: The blood on her clothes
was from a single subject,</i>

12:37.501 --> 12:41.337
- likely male, type A-negative.
- Okay. Probably caucasian.

12:41.372 --> 12:44.438
- Uh, in Boston, yes.
- And in Honolulu?

12:44.512 --> 12:48.111
Well, over a 60% chance that
the subject would be Polynesian.

12:48.145 --> 12:49.112
Do you make this stuff up 'cause

12:49.113 --> 12:51.447
- you know we can't check it?
- Yes.

12:51.482 --> 12:53.550
No. I'm not that fanciful.

12:53.584 --> 12:58.154
Uh, Jessica also had traces
of methylenedioxy on her skirt.

12:58.188 --> 13:01.090
Perfect, that narrows our search down
to 2,000 ecstasy dealers

13:01.125 --> 13:02.625
<i>and about a bajillion ecstasy users.</i>

13:02.693 --> 13:06.629
Oh, I also have a possible
explanation for her amnesia.

13:06.697 --> 13:10.099
She might be in a
dissociative fugue state.

13:10.134 --> 13:13.369
Is that Greek for "faking it?"
'Cause that's what we think right now.

13:13.404 --> 13:15.772
A fugue state is a very
rare condition that occurs

13:15.839 --> 13:18.274
when someone experiences
a trauma so severe

13:18.309 --> 13:20.777
that they block parts of their
consciousness related to it.

13:20.811 --> 13:25.081
A bad thing happens and they forget
anything that might remind

13:25.082 --> 13:26.516
- them of the bad thing.
- Yes.

13:26.550 --> 13:28.217
Jessica doesn't remember who she is

13:28.285 --> 13:31.421
<i>because it's directly connected
to the traumatic event.</i>

13:31.455 --> 13:33.122
But she remembers that
she likes the Red Sox

13:33.157 --> 13:36.859
because it's not.
Oh. There's my vase.

13:41.565 --> 13:43.666
Okay, assuming

13:43.701 --> 13:45.268
we thought this was real ...
which we do not ...

13:45.302 --> 13:46.603
how do we get her to snap out of it?

13:46.637 --> 13:48.771
I would suggest taking
her to familiar places

13:48.806 --> 13:51.140
and seeing if anything
triggers any memories.

13:51.175 --> 13:53.676
Great plan, but because of
her probably fake amnesia,

13:53.711 --> 13:55.044
we don't know anything about her.

13:55.079 --> 14:00.183
Uh, well, she did have
a firstpark ticket in her pocket

14:00.217 --> 14:03.319
and candy-coated fennel
seed in her teeth.

14:03.387 --> 14:06.789
Those are digestives often
found in Indian restaurants.

14:06.857 --> 14:08.591
So firstpark garages
near Indian restaurants.

14:08.626 --> 14:10.593
Does the phrase "wild goose chase"
mean anything to you?

14:10.628 --> 14:14.163
Yes, but...

14:14.198 --> 14:17.700
at least we get to try delicious
digestives all over the city.

14:17.735 --> 14:20.803
- Bye, Maura.
- Bye, Jane.

14:25.409 --> 14:28.244
All right. How about that?
It's called Taste of Tandoor.

14:28.278 --> 14:32.348
- No.
- How many stops do we have left?

14:32.383 --> 14:35.485
Two.
The next restaurant is on Emerson.

14:35.552 --> 14:37.286
Firstpark garage is around the corner.

14:37.321 --> 14:39.622
Oh. What do we do when
those turn up nothing?

14:39.657 --> 14:43.159
Call dispatch, have them put
her picture up on the website.

14:43.227 --> 14:45.361
Nothing? None of this
looks familiar to you?

14:45.429 --> 14:48.130
No. I'm sorry.

14:48.165 --> 14:49.799
Y-you had to have been
to at least one of these places.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.634
I mean, what about Abe & Louie's?

14:51.669 --> 14:53.336
Everybody in Boston's eaten there.

14:53.370 --> 14:56.272
No. Over there.
Across the street.

15:00.944 --> 15:02.779
Wait. Korsak, stop.

15:02.813 --> 15:04.647
Stop! Stop the car!
[tires screech]

15:06.917 --> 15:09.619
[horn honks]
[tires screech]

15:09.653 --> 15:12.188
<i>Woman: Oh, my gosh!
Look out for that car!</i>

15:12.222 --> 15:13.856
[horn honks]
[tires screech]

15:13.924 --> 15:15.376
<i>Man: What?! Are you crazy?!</i>

15:27.095 --> 15:28.929
[horn honks]

15:31.998 --> 15:34.201
Thanks.

15:34.235 --> 15:36.924
- I feel so stupid.
- No need.

15:37.505 --> 15:39.106
It just seemed so real.

15:39.140 --> 15:42.743
I mean, I could have sworn
he was standing right there.

15:42.777 --> 15:45.145
At the beginning of my career,

15:45.179 --> 15:47.147
I was first on the scene
at an auto accident.

15:47.181 --> 15:48.982
Older guy ran into a telephone pole.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.751
The M.E. at the time
thought he might have

15:50.785 --> 15:52.252
had a heart attack
and died at the wheel.

15:52.286 --> 15:55.188
And the man had a smile on his face

15:55.223 --> 15:57.157
like he died without
a care in the world.

15:57.191 --> 16:02.262
For months after that,
I saw the guy all over Boston ...

16:02.296 --> 16:04.898
sitting on a park bench,
once at Fenway Park.

16:04.932 --> 16:07.267
Did that really happen
or are you just telling me

16:07.268 --> 16:07.968
that to make me feel better?

16:08.002 --> 16:10.937
I swear to god. The
mind does funny things.

16:10.972 --> 16:13.106
Do you think Frost made us stop?

16:13.141 --> 16:14.875
Uh, I don't believe
in that stuff. Do you?

16:14.909 --> 16:16.260
No, but I think if I were dead

16:16.261 --> 16:20.046
and you were here with Frost,
he might have believed it.

16:21.182 --> 16:23.650
I mean, if she's running a con,

16:23.684 --> 16:25.919
does she actually think
she's gonna get away with it?

16:25.953 --> 16:27.921
I've said it before.

16:27.955 --> 16:30.891
Criminals are generally
very, very stupid.

16:30.958 --> 16:34.094
[horn honks]

16:41.302 --> 16:43.270
Okay, listen.

16:43.304 --> 16:45.872
I want to believe that what
you're saying is real ...

16:45.907 --> 16:47.507
that you don't remember
who you are, all right?

16:47.542 --> 16:49.509
And most days, I wouldn't
be able to do that.

16:49.544 --> 16:51.678
- But today I'm gonna try, okay?
- # Go 'round and 'round #

16:51.712 --> 16:53.647
- But if you don't remember something...
- # 'round and 'round #

16:53.681 --> 16:55.148
- ...I can't help you.
- # 'round and 'round #

Whoa. Whoa, whoa. What?
D-do you have children?

17:10.731 --> 17:13.066
I-I don't think so.

17:13.099 --> 17:16.002
Okay. Uh, does it have
something to do with kids?

17:17.305 --> 17:18.905
Are you a teacher?

17:20.340 --> 17:26.946
- Yes! [chuckles]
- Okay. Okay.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.750
Maybe he's helping us
solve this after all.

17:39.060 --> 17:42.175
- Any luck?
- It would help if teachers

17:42.176 --> 17:44.197
in Massachusetts had
fingerprints on file.

17:44.198 --> 17:45.298
I'll hop in my time machine

17:45.366 --> 17:47.200
and go back and let the
Union know your preference.

17:47.235 --> 17:51.071
W-without a name, I'm having
to call up individual schools.

17:51.105 --> 17:53.073
And I'm making a list
of absent teachers.

17:53.107 --> 17:55.242
And I'm pulling up
footage from schools nearby

17:55.276 --> 17:57.277
to see if she wandered
out of one of them.

17:57.311 --> 17:59.145
[groans]

17:59.180 --> 18:00.981
It's gonna take a
while to finish it all.

18:01.015 --> 18:04.751
I get it. Fingerprints on
file would be a lot easier.

18:04.785 --> 18:07.888
- Where's Jane?
- It was a long day. I sent her home.

18:07.922 --> 18:09.990
And she listened?
[chuckles]

18:10.057 --> 18:12.993
I suppose it's possible she's
sitting downstairs in the lobby.

18:14.662 --> 18:17.163
How's it coming with the
music for the funeral?

18:17.198 --> 18:20.834
Oh, I've eliminated many, many choices.

18:20.868 --> 18:22.836
- So nowhere.
- [chuckling] Basically.

18:22.870 --> 18:23.870
Hmm.

18:23.938 --> 18:27.140
[chuckles]

18:28.976 --> 18:32.045
- Lunch sucked today.
- What did you do?

18:32.079 --> 18:35.649
[sighs] I sat at my desk and...

18:35.683 --> 18:38.919
wondered where Frost
would have wanted to go.

18:38.953 --> 18:41.154
What did you decide?

18:43.391 --> 18:46.359
[voice breaking]
I ... I wasn't hungry.

18:48.229 --> 18:49.362
Hmm.

18:50.932 --> 18:53.667
Oh, hell.

18:57.305 --> 19:00.006
[knock on door] I'm headed home.

19:00.041 --> 19:02.742
Well, you're welcome to spend
the night again if you'd like.

19:02.777 --> 19:04.144
No, thanks. I'd rather be alone.

19:08.816 --> 19:13.053
- No offense.
- None taken. How are you holding up?

19:13.120 --> 19:15.188
[sighs]

19:15.222 --> 19:19.059
- I'm tired.
- Well, the development of the placenta

19:19.126 --> 19:20.827
is one of the most
energetically intense parts

19:20.861 --> 19:22.963
of the first trimester ...
that could be the reason.

19:22.997 --> 19:25.231
Or it could be that one of
my best friends just died.

19:25.966 --> 19:28.401
Yes. That could be it, too.

19:28.469 --> 19:32.706
- I saw him on the street today.
- I'm sorry?

19:32.740 --> 19:36.943
I mean, I didn't. [stammers]
I thought I saw him on the street today.

19:36.978 --> 19:39.245
That's called an anomalous experience.

19:39.280 --> 19:43.850
It's ... it's perfectly normal.
As is crying.

19:43.884 --> 19:45.852
How do you know I haven't cried yet?

19:45.886 --> 19:47.954
Because you would have
said, "I had a good cry

19:48.022 --> 19:49.789
and it didn't help,"
or something like that.

19:49.857 --> 19:52.092
How are you doing?

19:52.126 --> 19:54.094
I think I've moved
through denial and anger.

19:54.128 --> 19:56.363
I'm ready to move into bargaining

19:56.430 --> 19:58.164
and I'll have a good cry
when I get to depression.

19:58.199 --> 20:00.700
- Can't plan a cry, Maura.
- I'm not planning it.

20:00.735 --> 20:03.403
I'm just narrowing down
the window of its arrival.

20:03.437 --> 20:05.839
And it occurred to me today that ...

20:05.873 --> 20:08.375
that we need to talk
about our last wishes.

20:08.409 --> 20:11.478
- No, we don't.
- I want to be buried at sea.

20:11.512 --> 20:13.119
No. I hate boats.

20:13.120 --> 20:17.422
And I'd have to go to city hall
and get all kinds of permits and...

20:17.423 --> 20:20.134
no, just pick something more landlocked.

20:20.135 --> 20:24.497
Jane, I want to return to the
primordial soup that spawned us all.

20:24.532 --> 20:27.753
But nothing fancy ... a small group
of friends and family, a cello.

20:27.836 --> 20:31.826
We're on a boat, Maura.
And a cello is officially fancy.

20:31.936 --> 20:33.315
Well, there would only be one.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.359
And it should play
Bach's suite in "G" major.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.774
And then everyone can
toast me with a nice

20:38.775 --> 20:40.780
bottle of champagne before
you throw me overboard.

20:40.848 --> 20:45.365
- So, what do you want?
- I want to die one day before you

20:45.436 --> 20:48.555
so I don't have to go out on a boat.

20:48.589 --> 20:49.823
[elevator bell dings]

20:51.926 --> 20:53.226
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:54.829 --> 20:56.696
[chuckles]

21:03.404 --> 21:05.372
Hey, Ma.
What are you doing here?

21:05.406 --> 21:07.040
Making dinner.

21:07.074 --> 21:11.244
I really appreciate it,
but, uh, I'm not that hungry.

21:11.279 --> 21:13.480
Then you'll eat just a little bit.

21:13.548 --> 21:15.081
I just want to go to bed, Ma.

21:15.116 --> 21:18.385
You got to eat, Jane.
Even if you're sad.

21:20.121 --> 21:21.621
Come on.

21:26.394 --> 21:28.395
[sighs]

21:37.405 --> 21:41.174
- Why are you still here?
- For Jane.

21:41.209 --> 21:42.475
Yeah, I figured the
more progress we make,

21:42.510 --> 21:43.743
the less she'll have
to worry about the case.

21:43.778 --> 21:46.279
- What about you?
- Same thing.

21:46.314 --> 21:47.681
Come on! Please?

21:47.748 --> 21:49.983
Okay, well, t-the next time
you ask me for a favor...

21:50.017 --> 21:54.254
I'll... probably help you
out because I'm a decent guy.

21:54.322 --> 21:58.058
- But I will not be nice about it!
- What's going on?

21:58.092 --> 22:00.360
Well, we didn't get anywhere
with the local teachers' unions.

22:00.394 --> 22:01.695
And then it dawns on me.

22:01.729 --> 22:04.564
Maybe our woman doesn't
work in the public school.

22:04.599 --> 22:07.534
So I called a bunch of private schools
near Indian restaurants.

22:07.568 --> 22:10.270
- You know who she is?
- Lily Greene.

22:10.304 --> 22:13.773
Uh, she teaches at Red Tree preschool.

22:13.808 --> 22:16.109
Only I can't find a judge
to sign a search warrant.

22:16.143 --> 22:19.746
I walked in at the right moment.
That just happens to be my specialty.

22:24.168 --> 22:25.836
Good night.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.454
Have a good shift, Todd.

22:27.488 --> 22:30.156
Oh, you have a nice evening, too.
Uh, Dr. Isles?

22:30.191 --> 22:32.058
I-I heard about Detective Frost.

22:32.093 --> 22:34.527
I'm sorry. I know the
two of you were close.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.796
Thank you, Todd.

22:36.831 --> 22:40.200
He was a nice guy ...
a-a really nice guy.

22:41.702 --> 22:44.671
Yes. He was.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.451
[sniffles]

22:58.386 --> 23:01.254
[sobbing]

23:19.755 --> 23:20.755
[knocking]

23:20.756 --> 23:22.657
- Good morning.
- Shh!

23:22.691 --> 23:24.258
What?

23:24.292 --> 23:27.328
<i>- Oh. What is she doing here?
- Watching me.</i>

23:39.244 --> 23:43.481
Before we go to the station,
can we stop and get some breakfast?

23:43.549 --> 23:46.184
We're not going to the station.
We're going to Lily Greene's apartment.

23:46.218 --> 23:49.454
Oh. I'm so hungry.
Who's Lily Greene?

23:49.488 --> 23:52.023
You know, miss "I have blood all over me
and I don't know who I am."

23:52.057 --> 23:53.291
So you found out who
she is. That's great.

23:53.325 --> 23:56.027
- What did she say when you told her?
- Well, we haven't told her yet.

23:56.061 --> 23:57.295
I mean, we've got one
shot at a confession.

23:57.329 --> 23:59.764
So if we open the door to
her apartment and there's

23:59.765 --> 24:02.200
a dead body in there, it kind
of makes it a little difficult

24:02.234 --> 24:04.202
for her to keep faking amnesia ...

24:04.236 --> 24:08.272
- if that's what she's doing.
- Okay, so crime scene, then breakfast.

24:08.307 --> 24:10.408
Why didn't you eat a muffin
before you left the house?

24:10.442 --> 24:12.143
There's no nutrition in a muffin.

24:15.981 --> 24:19.217
There's no nutrition in gum.

24:19.251 --> 24:21.347
<i>Well, I like juicy fruit.</i>

24:36.268 --> 24:39.270
- Clear.
- Clear.

24:39.304 --> 24:42.507
- Can I come in now?
- Yeah.

24:42.574 --> 24:45.543
Just seems that we're one body
short of an actual crime scene.

24:45.577 --> 24:46.644
Well, there's been a crime.

24:46.678 --> 24:51.415
- Just not one requiring an autopsy.
- It's a very thorough search.

24:51.450 --> 24:53.050
Yeah, which begs the question,
what were they looking for?

24:53.085 --> 24:57.288
Found some money wrappers.
About $2,000 worth.

24:57.322 --> 25:00.291
I can fast-track them for drug residue.

25:04.196 --> 25:08.933
Looks like there's a Mr. Lily Greene.

25:08.967 --> 25:12.069
<i>Frankie: I pulled up her cellphone
records as soon as we got the warrant.</i>

25:12.104 --> 25:16.440
She made a lot of calls
to a guy named Toby Warren.

25:19.077 --> 25:21.012
Okay.
Let's get a warrant out for him, too.

25:29.187 --> 25:30.521
[grunts]

25:30.556 --> 25:33.958
Thanks.

25:35.661 --> 25:40.031
Barista gave me the usual.
I didn't have the heart to give it back.

25:40.065 --> 25:43.534
- What are you doing?
- Um...

25:43.569 --> 25:46.037
the part of the job that
Frost would normally do

25:46.071 --> 25:47.939
and a lot slower than
he would normally do it.

25:48.006 --> 25:50.608
So far, Lily Greene seems
like a stand-up citizen.

25:50.642 --> 25:52.610
There's not even a parking ticket.

25:52.644 --> 25:55.580
And all I got on Toby
Warren is that he's been

25:55.614 --> 25:57.949
collecting unemployment
for the past 18 months.

25:57.983 --> 26:01.018
Maybe she got tired of supporting him.
He trashed the apartment

26:01.053 --> 26:02.320
looking for extra money
to soften his landing.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.555
She tracked him down,
ended the relationship.

26:04.590 --> 26:07.992
I feel sorry for Kiki if this is how
you think you should end a relationship.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.728
I'm not dating Kiki.
She's my life coach.

26:14.466 --> 26:18.436
How about I take over... "that"
and you go get some fresh air?

26:18.470 --> 26:20.538
I can keep hitting the button.

26:20.572 --> 26:23.407
That's probably a good idea.

26:27.412 --> 26:29.923
<i>My condolences.</i>

26:31.882 --> 26:34.818
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:35.810 --> 26:38.378
How are you doing?

26:38.412 --> 26:42.615
If I get up at the funeral
and just say nothing,

26:42.650 --> 26:44.250
will you nod your head

26:44.285 --> 26:46.586
like I'm doing something
deep and meaningful?

26:46.620 --> 26:49.656
I absolutely will.

26:51.425 --> 26:53.393
Did you find anything at
Toby Warren's apartment?

26:53.427 --> 26:55.362
Not Toby Warren, if
that's what you mean.

26:55.396 --> 26:58.893
You have a "but" to go along
with that unhelpful information?

26:59.013 --> 27:02.369
His cellphone's been pinging
off the same tower for 24 hours.

27:02.436 --> 27:05.672
I had his service
provider turn on his GPS.

27:05.740 --> 27:07.607
Is that your way of telling
me to get off my ass?

27:07.641 --> 27:09.876
[clears throat]

27:11.479 --> 27:13.948
Come on.

27:14.732 --> 27:17.667
[guns cock]

27:42.326 --> 27:43.627
[camera shutter clicking]

27:43.694 --> 27:46.563
We got one bullet
embedded in the wood here.

27:46.631 --> 27:49.065
Hey, Frankie. Our gun may
have been discharged twice.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.200
Let's see if we can
find that other bullet.

27:50.268 --> 27:52.636
- Will do.
- Thanks.

27:52.670 --> 27:55.071
Based on this wound and that bullet,

27:55.106 --> 27:58.175
- he was kneeling when he died.
- It's an execution.

27:58.209 --> 28:01.178
So, the bullet entered
in his parietal bone

28:01.245 --> 28:03.180
<i>right above the lambdoid suture</i>

28:03.247 --> 28:05.248
<i>and it exited through the
right common carotid artery.</i>

28:05.283 --> 28:10.086
In order for her to be
covered in arterial spray

28:10.121 --> 28:13.423
- on that part of her clothes...
- She'd had to have been kneeling

28:13.491 --> 28:15.859
right next to him when he was shot.

28:15.893 --> 28:18.228
That's certainly something
I'd want to forget.

28:18.262 --> 28:21.631
But to create that angle
and this entry wound,

28:21.699 --> 28:26.536
the bullet fired at at least
15 degrees from perpendicular

28:26.571 --> 28:29.105
and at a distance of
greater than 18 inches.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.474
Mm-hmm, so that means
she would have to shoot

28:31.509 --> 28:35.812
across his body.
That can't be done.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.781
No. Not unless her
arms are four feet long.

28:37.815 --> 28:41.484
So, either she's Elastigirl
or Lily Greene didn't kill Toby Warren.

28:41.519 --> 28:44.621
Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb
and eliminate your Elastigirl theory.

28:44.655 --> 28:47.157
Hey, doc? I got a round
blood drop on the floor here.

28:47.191 --> 28:48.792
And no way that's splatter
from Toby Warren, right?

28:48.826 --> 28:50.760
That definitely didn't
come from Toby's wounds.

28:50.795 --> 28:53.396
I don't know where the second bullet is,
but it looks like it hit someone.

28:53.431 --> 28:57.234
Well, what if the tissue that you found
under Lily's fingernails

28:57.268 --> 28:59.236
were from her fighting the killer?

28:59.270 --> 29:01.404
It could be that's how
she ended up with the gun.

29:01.439 --> 29:04.474
Jane, this one's smeared.
Looks like they stepped in it.

29:04.508 --> 29:07.444
Judging from the stride,
looks like they were running.

29:07.478 --> 29:11.448
Okay. So...
someone shoots Toby.

29:11.482 --> 29:13.550
Lily ends up with the gun,
shoots that person,

29:13.618 --> 29:15.151
and he or she runs away.

29:15.186 --> 29:17.387
Those are the facts as
we currently know them.

29:17.455 --> 29:19.439
Just because Lily didn't
shoot Toby doesn't mean

29:19.440 --> 29:21.424
she wasn't involved in
whatever got him shot.

29:21.492 --> 29:23.560
- Is that your gut?
- No.

29:23.594 --> 29:28.498
No, my gut says that whoever
ran away is our killer

29:28.499 --> 29:32.435
and that Lily Greene is
a completely innocent schoolteacher

29:32.470 --> 29:35.071
who just had the worst
night of her life.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.680
Would you like a cup of coffee?

29:43.714 --> 29:46.416
It won't taste very good, but it'll be warm.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.319
No, thank you.
Did you find out who I am?

29:49.353 --> 29:52.289
We did.
Your name is Lily Greene.

29:52.323 --> 29:54.091
Um, you're a preschool teacher.

29:55.860 --> 29:57.694
Does any of that sound familiar?

29:57.728 --> 30:01.431
- Not really.
- Okay.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.267
We think we have an idea
of what happened to you.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.802
You do?

30:09.040 --> 30:13.421
Lily...
do you recognize this man?

30:14.045 --> 30:16.813
<i>Toby: No, I s-swear I'll make this right.</i>

30:16.881 --> 30:18.348
<i>If you just give me a chance.
I promise.</i>

30:18.382 --> 30:21.251
<i>I'll do anything.
It won't happen again.</i>

30:21.285 --> 30:22.786
<i>I didn't think ...
I mean, I didn't know.</i>

30:22.820 --> 30:24.454
<i>[gunshot]
[screams]</i>

30:24.489 --> 30:28.258
- No. No, no, no. No.
- Okay. I-I know this is hard.

30:28.292 --> 30:33.230
- I don't want to talk anymore.
- Lily... you're safe.

30:33.264 --> 30:36.333
Whatever happened, you're safe now.

30:36.367 --> 30:37.801
And pretending that it didn't happen ...

30:37.835 --> 30:40.837
it's not gonna change anything.

30:47.044 --> 30:51.148
<i>Toby: Please!
Don't. I swear I'll fix this.</i>

30:51.182 --> 30:53.783
<i>I can. If you just give
me a chance, I promise.</i>

30:55.987 --> 30:57.487
Toby.

30:59.323 --> 31:01.391
I'm so sorry, sweetie. He's dead.

31:01.459 --> 31:04.027
[sobs]

31:08.332 --> 31:11.001
Tell me what you remember.

31:11.035 --> 31:15.005
[voice breaking]
No, he was a good man.

31:15.039 --> 31:17.040
I think he just lost his way, you know?

31:17.074 --> 31:20.477
I do.
I do. What happened?

31:20.511 --> 31:23.079
A couple nights ago, Toby told me

31:23.114 --> 31:25.081
that in college he used to sell drugs

31:25.116 --> 31:27.450
and that he started again
when he lost his job.

31:27.485 --> 31:30.954
<i>He needed to pay his bills
so he took some money.</i>

31:30.988 --> 31:34.224
And the man he was
dealing for found out,

31:34.258 --> 31:37.027
said he had to give it back.

31:37.061 --> 31:42.165
<i>Toby told me he was in trouble.
I lent him everything I had.</i>

31:42.233 --> 31:44.801
It wasn't all he owed, but we thought,

31:44.835 --> 31:49.206
you know, if we just
showed good faith...

31:49.240 --> 31:52.475
but... it didn't matter.

31:52.510 --> 31:56.413
We'll make him pay for this, Lily.
Just help me find him.

31:57.480 --> 32:03.153
His name is Kyle.
That's all I know.

32:03.187 --> 32:05.322
That's enough.

32:05.356 --> 32:08.291
[crying]

32:08.359 --> 32:11.861
We'll find him. I promise.

32:11.896 --> 32:13.396
[elevator bell dings]

32:17.001 --> 32:21.371
Hi. Did you pick out
music for the funeral yet?

32:21.405 --> 32:23.940
I got it narrowed down
to about 20 choices.

32:23.975 --> 32:26.042
Which is only slightly
better than no choices.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.478
- Where are you with the pictures?
- Done.

32:28.512 --> 32:31.348
Did you know that he had
a wall full of albums?

32:31.415 --> 32:33.116
Guy loved music. Makes
sense he'd have a lot of CDs.

32:33.150 --> 32:37.854
Not CDs.
Vinyl.

32:37.888 --> 32:41.157
It was on the turntable.
It's probably the thing he listened to

32:41.192 --> 32:45.228
before he left on vacation.
Thought it might help you out.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.830
Detective Frost had good taste.

32:48.666 --> 32:53.203
[voice breaking] And just like that,
I've narrowed my choices down to one.

32:53.237 --> 32:55.238
Thanks, Frankie.

33:00.210 --> 33:03.413
Frankie, you sure this is a solid lead?

<i>Everybody going in and out of this place
looks more moonshine than ecstasy.</i>

33:06.917 --> 33:09.286

Kyle, but they've heard his name

33:09.320 --> 33:12.155
and they say this is where most of
the ecstasy in Boston passes through.

My mom took the food because she said
she knew what Frost would want.

Maura took the flowers

33:40.285 --> 33:42.352

knew anything about flowers.

the eulogy, I just...

concentration, you know? It...

a good cry, loosen yourself up.

candy back in its hiding place.

37:22.624 --> 37:25.024
[music]

37:27.663 --> 37:30.131
<i>a cop...</i>

37:35.270 --> 37:37.205
...a friend.

37:37.272 --> 37:41.542
<i>I met Barry when he joined homicide.</i>

37:41.577 --> 37:45.213
And he was so nervous because

37:45.247 --> 37:48.116
parts of the job didn't
really agree with him,

37:48.150 --> 37:50.718
<i>but he didn't let that stand in his way.</i>

37:50.786 --> 37:53.588
<i>He just wanted to be the
best cop that he could be.</i>

37:53.622 --> 37:55.823
<i>He wanted to work harder, be smarter,</i>

37:55.891 --> 37:58.226
<i>try new things, and push himself.</i>

37:58.293 --> 38:01.596
And I admired

38:01.630 --> 38:04.565
the passion that he brought to his work.

38:04.600 --> 38:09.737
I will miss him as my partner.

38:13.842 --> 38:17.945
And I will ... [voice breaking]
and I will miss him as my friend.

38:20.115 --> 38:25.019
<i>But as I was preparing this eulogy,</i>

38:25.054 --> 38:29.190
<i>I realized that I didn't want to
just think about what we've lost.</i>

38:29.224 --> 38:31.859
<i>I wanted to find something
that we could hold on to.</i>

38:31.927 --> 38:35.029
<i>So I started thinking about Barry</i>

38:35.064 --> 38:37.999
and ... and what I
really loved about him.

38:38.033 --> 38:41.169
And ... and one idea
kept coming to mind.

38:45.707 --> 38:48.643
I really loved how he made me laugh.

38:52.881 --> 38:56.717
<i>And I will miss that infectious smile</i>

38:56.785 --> 39:01.625
<i>and the joy that he
brought to every day.</i>

39:03.826 --> 39:08.763
So, in this moment when it
feels like there is none,

39:08.831 --> 39:10.898
here is the good news.

39:10.933 --> 39:12.700
[inhales sharply]

39:20.809 --> 39:23.811
[voice breaking]
Death may have taken Barry,

39:23.846 --> 39:28.316
but it can't take our memories of him.

39:28.383 --> 39:32.987
Those wonderful and perfect

39:33.021 --> 39:36.090
<i>and beautiful memories.</i>

39:37.993 --> 39:40.862
Those, thank god, are ours to keep.

39:50.072 --> 39:54.453
[piano plays "What a wonderful world"]

40:13.028 --> 40:14.996
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

40:15.030 --> 40:18.232
[sighs] Maura, I'm gonna be okay.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.134
Yes.

40:20.169 --> 40:23.437
No, no. I'm ... really,
I'm going right to bed.

40:24.907 --> 40:28.009
I know that you would come
over and stay with me, yes.

40:28.043 --> 40:30.778
You know you're a good friend, right?

40:31.013 --> 40:34.015
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

40:34.049 --> 40:35.049
[cellphone beeps]

40:37.121 --> 40:40.947
[music]

40:46.798 --> 40:51.131
<i>"Couldn't be better here,
but I miss you anyway.  Barry."</i>

40:52.401 --> 40:56.170
[sniffles]

41:03.178 --> 41:06.414
