00:07.674 --> 00:09.301
<i>- NClS.
- l need help.</i>

00:09.468 --> 00:12.721
<i>- You'll have to speak up, ma'am.
- l've been abducted.</i>

00:14.473 --> 00:16.225
<i>- Are you there, ma'am?
- Where is it?</i>

00:17.184 --> 00:18.810
No.

00:20.229 --> 00:23.232
<i>- NClS.
- My name is Wilkerson.</i>

00:25.150 --> 00:26.860
l've been abducted.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.154
Please. Please, help me.

00:29.321 --> 00:33.158
<i>- Ma'am.
- No. Help me, please!</i>

01:28.915 --> 01:30.250
Hi.

01:31.334 --> 01:33.503
You know what l like about coming
to work on a Sunday?

01:33.670 --> 01:36.423
- The relaxed dress code?
- Actually, no.

01:36.631 --> 01:40.093
lt offers us the unique chance
to get a glimpse

01:40.302 --> 01:42.095
into the private lives
of our co-workers.

01:42.262 --> 01:45.181
Except l have no interest
in your life.

01:45.432 --> 01:47.475
Now, me, l was playing football.

01:47.684 --> 01:52.606
lt's American football.
You, l'm guessing, yoga?

01:52.772 --> 01:56.276
Why do you insist on calling it football
when you don't use your feet?

01:56.484 --> 01:58.153
No. Hadn't though of that.

01:58.403 --> 02:00.113
Well, we kick it sometimes.
Listen to this.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.490
So anyway, right, it's first and goal.

02:02.699 --> 02:04.117
l'm about to snap the ball,

02:04.326 --> 02:05.619
and my butt starts to vibrate.

02:05.785 --> 02:07.787
l've seen this on TV.
There was a guy behind you.

02:07.954 --> 02:10.457
No, it wasn't the quarterback.
lt was my phone.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.626
So you keep it
in your pants at all times?

02:16.463 --> 02:17.631
Enough about me.

02:17.797 --> 02:20.800
- Let me guess. Pilates?
- Very good, Tony.

02:20.967 --> 02:24.304
l am an investigator.
lt's kind of what l do.

02:29.059 --> 02:31.144
l thought you said
you were doing Pilates.

02:31.311 --> 02:32.938
lsn't Pilates one of your martial arts?

02:33.146 --> 02:35.732
No, it's kind of like
expensive stretching.

02:35.982 --> 02:38.026
Well, then, l guess
l wasn't doing a Pilate.

02:39.027 --> 02:40.737
Mind giving me a hand with this?

02:40.987 --> 02:43.657
Yes, l do. Whose blood is that?

02:44.491 --> 02:45.659
Not mine.

02:49.579 --> 02:51.706
- Where's McGee?
- ln trouble.

02:51.873 --> 02:55.377
l left messages on his home phone,
cell and BlackBerry. No answer.

02:56.336 --> 02:57.546
Rule number three.

02:58.213 --> 03:00.840
Never be unreachable.
When Gibbs finds out about this--

03:01.007 --> 03:04.261
- Find out what, DiNozzo?
- We got a possible abduction, boss.

03:04.511 --> 03:07.847
Call came in at 0903,
Fairfax area code.

03:08.014 --> 03:10.559
Caller said her name was Wilkerson,
then the line went dead.

03:10.725 --> 03:12.185
Ran a reverse look-up
on the number.

03:12.352 --> 03:15.105
lt came back belonging
to a Navy lieutenant commander.

03:15.272 --> 03:18.108
Commander Wilkerson, stationed at
Department of Navy, Washington, D.C.

03:18.275 --> 03:20.026
No one answers
from her home phone or cell.

03:20.193 --> 03:21.403
She's currently on liberty,

03:21.570 --> 03:25.866
scheduled to be back at work
tomorrow morning at 07.

03:26.241 --> 03:28.869
That's a nice suit.
You didn't get married again, did you?

03:31.997 --> 03:34.624
lf you have more, DiNozzo,
now would be a good time.

03:34.875 --> 03:38.003
Yeah.
Her cell wasn't GPS-enabled,

03:38.211 --> 03:41.756
but the service provider
narrowed the call location,

03:42.007 --> 03:43.884
you know, to the-- To the--

03:44.050 --> 03:45.385
- Radius.
- Radius.

03:45.552 --> 03:47.512
The two-and-a-half-mile radius,
yeah.

03:47.679 --> 03:49.556
They said they'd contact us
if it's used again.

03:49.723 --> 03:51.433
We might be able to triangulate,
get a fix.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.226
- Where's McGee?
- l don't know.

03:53.393 --> 03:56.062
Sunday's a spiritual day
in your country, Gibbs. Perhaps--

03:56.271 --> 03:58.815
Did you get Lieutenant Commander
Wilkerson's home address?

03:59.065 --> 04:00.108
l did.

04:00.317 --> 04:01.526
Then why are you still here?

04:04.070 --> 04:06.239
Are you waiting for an invitation,
Officer David?

04:06.406 --> 04:09.284
- So you really are getting married?
- He means you're with me.

04:10.911 --> 04:14.080
- Oh, l knew that.
- Tick, tock, tick, tock.

04:14.289 --> 04:15.749
- Morning, men.
- Hi.

04:23.423 --> 04:26.051
Reporting for duty as ordered, sir.

04:26.259 --> 04:27.802
- Wrong hand, Abs.
- Sorry, sir.

04:27.969 --> 04:30.305
Call came in from a woman
claiming she was abducted, Abby.

04:30.472 --> 04:32.265
l need an acoustical analysis
of the tape.

04:32.432 --> 04:35.810
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- You always speak freely, Abs.

04:36.061 --> 04:38.605
l know. l just always wanted
to say that. So where's my tape?

04:38.772 --> 04:42.317
- On the way to your lab.
- Then so am l.

04:42.984 --> 04:45.654
lf l finish quickly, maybe l can
get back to Habitat for Humanity.

04:45.862 --> 04:48.281
l'm doing a bunch of wiring
for them this weekend.

04:48.448 --> 04:50.116
- We'll see, Abby.
- Thank you, sir.

04:50.283 --> 04:52.285
- Don't call me ''sir.''
- Thank you, ma'am.

04:57.123 --> 04:59.000
lt's clear she isn't home.
What's our plan?

04:59.209 --> 05:02.087
We use good old-fashioned
American ingenuity.

05:02.295 --> 05:04.965
Good plan,
except l'm not American, Tony.

05:05.131 --> 05:06.591
Well, lucky for you, l am.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.386
- We start looking for the key.
- Why would there be a key?

05:09.636 --> 05:11.721
Because they always hide one.

05:11.972 --> 05:14.140
lt's stupid, l know,
but it's what they do.

05:16.476 --> 05:17.811
You're certain there's no alarm?

05:18.019 --> 05:20.730
Positive. No sign, no alarm.
But there's always a key.

05:20.981 --> 05:23.108
You may wanna write that down.

05:25.318 --> 05:27.153
After you.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.881
- Clear.
- Clear.

05:46.131 --> 05:47.340
Very OCD.

05:47.549 --> 05:49.175
- OCD?
- Anal-retentive.

05:49.342 --> 05:51.636
- Are you're saying she's a neat freak?
- Yeah.

05:52.145 --> 05:53.980
Nice job with the lock, by the way.

05:54.189 --> 05:57.817
Thank you. lt was a very simple
pin-and-tumbler design.

05:57.984 --> 06:00.737
So are handcuffs, but l bet you
couldn't get out of a pair of those.

06:00.945 --> 06:03.031
Are you saying
you'd like to handcuff me, Tony?

06:03.239 --> 06:04.949
lt's not really my thing, Ziva.

06:05.825 --> 06:07.660
l see.

06:08.828 --> 06:12.081
You're the one who likes
to be handcuffed, then, huh?

06:16.836 --> 06:17.879
Spread out.

06:21.591 --> 06:25.512
- What are we looking for exactly?
- Anything that's out of place.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.056
You're gonna have to be
a little bit more specific.

06:28.264 --> 06:29.349
We're looking for a reason

06:29.557 --> 06:31.476
why someone would kidnap
our Naval officer.

06:32.018 --> 06:37.273
Preferably before Gibbs
asks us for it.

06:39.609 --> 06:41.236
<i>You're absolutely certain
the phone call</i>

06:41.402 --> 06:43.571
<i>was from Lieutenant Commander
Wilkerson, Agent Gibbs?</i>

06:43.780 --> 06:45.198
Not yet, captain.

06:45.406 --> 06:48.201
l was hoping you could
help me out with that.

06:49.702 --> 06:52.288
<i>- l need help.
- You'll have to speak up, ma'am.</i>

06:52.539 --> 06:54.582
<i>l've been abducted.</i>

06:56.417 --> 06:58.628
<i>That's her. That's her voice.</i>

06:58.878 --> 07:00.088
Why would someone abduct her?

07:00.296 --> 07:02.882
<i>- She's a Force Protection Officer.
- Protecting what?</i>

07:03.550 --> 07:05.009
<i>Right now, my worst nightmare.</i>

07:06.094 --> 07:08.847
<i>We're now at Force Protection
condition delta, gentlemen.</i>

07:09.055 --> 07:10.557
<i>- Notify the admiral.
- Yes, sir.</i>

07:10.723 --> 07:12.183
<i>l'm heading your way,
Agent Gibbs.</i>

07:12.392 --> 07:14.185
<i>l need to come in
to brief you personally.</i>

07:14.394 --> 07:16.354
That's great, captain.
You mind telling me why?

07:16.563 --> 07:20.066
<i>Last night a shipment of nuclear
fuel rods left a reactor plant in Ohio.</i>

07:20.316 --> 07:21.943
<i>- Bound for?
- That's classified.</i>

07:22.151 --> 07:25.738
<i>Only a handful of people know
the exact route that train is taking.</i>

07:25.947 --> 07:28.074
And Lieutenant Commander
Wilkerson was one of them.

07:35.081 --> 07:36.958
Houdini?

07:37.167 --> 07:39.294
How are you
at picking computer locks?

07:39.460 --> 07:42.630
Not very good. Why, did you find
something interesting, Tony?

07:45.300 --> 07:47.552
Tony, did you find
something interesting?

07:48.511 --> 07:50.138
- Tony.
- Hands over your heads.

07:50.388 --> 07:53.057
Now. You too, lady.

07:55.977 --> 07:58.313
Make any sudden moves, l shoot.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.731
Do we understand each other?

07:59.898 --> 08:03.067
Okay, relax, quick-draw. We're feds.

08:03.276 --> 08:05.153
Yeah? What agency?

08:05.403 --> 08:06.487
- N--
- NClS.

08:07.906 --> 08:08.948
Never heard of it.

08:09.157 --> 08:11.910
- Naval Criminal lnvestigative Service.
- Never heard of it.

08:12.118 --> 08:15.955
You never actually get used to it.
You think you will, but you never do.

08:16.164 --> 08:18.958
- Okay, l have a badge.
- Sit down.

08:22.253 --> 08:23.296
Cuff yourself to him.

08:24.172 --> 08:26.633
- l'd rather you shoot me first.
- Cuff yourself, dirtbag.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.519
Now, you cuff yourself to the chair.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.860
You're making a big mistake.

08:46.027 --> 08:47.695
Yeah, like you did
setting off the alarm?

08:48.404 --> 08:51.741
There's supposed to be a sign outside.
There's supposed to be a sign outside.

08:51.991 --> 08:54.869
Kids probably stole it. Don't move!

08:58.832 --> 09:02.919
Central, got two suspects
claiming to be feds.

09:04.921 --> 09:09.843
No little red light on the radio
means the radio not working.

09:12.554 --> 09:14.597
- Hey.
- Will you please calm down?

09:14.764 --> 09:17.433
This guy is a little jumpy
and nervous, so just relax.

09:17.684 --> 09:18.935
No sudden moves, all right?

09:22.021 --> 09:24.274
No, no! Don't shoot!

09:24.524 --> 09:27.443
- Don't shoot.
- Nobody's gonna shoot anyone.

09:27.652 --> 09:30.029
- Right, Officer David?
- He called me a dirtbag.

09:30.238 --> 09:32.740
- l'm sorry, ma'am.
- Ma'am?

09:36.536 --> 09:38.788
<i>- My name is Wilkerson.
- You hear that?</i>

09:40.039 --> 09:41.249
- Hear what?
- Gibbs,

09:41.416 --> 09:43.585
l thought your hearing
was better than your eyesight.

09:43.751 --> 09:44.961
How wrong was l?

09:45.170 --> 09:47.755
Okay, l'll just back up, slow it down,

09:47.964 --> 09:51.050
fiddle with the hertz a bit
and we will interpret this as we go.

09:51.259 --> 09:52.302
lt'd be a good idea.

09:52.552 --> 09:55.263
<i>- Okay, just after she says her name--
- Wilkerson--</i>

09:56.764 --> 09:57.891
Name that tune, Gibbs.

09:58.099 --> 09:59.809
- That's a tyre skid.
- Yes.

09:59.976 --> 10:01.311
So the car braked.

10:01.561 --> 10:04.439
<i>- Next up, is the funk.
- Abducted.</i>

10:04.898 --> 10:08.234
Manual trunk release.
Now, the second that happens,

10:08.443 --> 10:11.821
the ambient noise changes.
Mostly the engine sound.

10:13.323 --> 10:14.490
She's in a car trunk.

10:14.699 --> 10:16.826
Yes again.
Now for the big finish.

10:17.076 --> 10:21.456
Exactly 3.4 seconds later,
the trunk is slammed shut.

10:21.664 --> 10:25.835
But the engine sound stays the same
until the phone shut off.

10:27.212 --> 10:28.963
They took the phone,
left her in the trunk.

10:29.130 --> 10:30.256
l'm afraid so, Gibbs.

10:30.423 --> 10:32.842
- How much time does she have?
- There's a lot of factors.

10:33.009 --> 10:35.303
Depends on the age of the car,
how airtight's the trunk,

10:35.470 --> 10:37.347
- how much CO2 she releases--
- Abby.

10:38.348 --> 10:41.267
Twelve hours she might be safe,
then she'd slip into a coma.

10:41.476 --> 10:43.645
After 1 7,
she'd definitely run out of oxygen.

11:04.249 --> 11:07.502
We stopped the nuclear-supply train
in Pennsylvania, in a rural area.

11:07.352 --> 11:10.188
lt's heavily armoured and defended
by FAST Company Marines.

11:10.397 --> 11:12.232
The fuel rods are
in a containment capsule

11:12.399 --> 11:14.109
capable of withstanding
small-arms fire.

11:14.276 --> 11:17.529
However, if someone did manage
to detonate those fuel rods,

11:17.696 --> 11:19.197
they would irradiate
a 1 0-mile radius.

11:19.364 --> 11:22.284
How many other people
know about the train's route?

11:22.492 --> 11:24.369
The personnel onboard escorting,

11:24.578 --> 11:27.080
two Cobras flying air escort
and my staff.

11:27.289 --> 11:30.000
And Lieutenant Commander
Wilkerson's involvement?

11:30.208 --> 11:33.503
She helped plan both the primary
and alternate routes.

11:33.712 --> 11:35.964
What the hell was she doing
on liberty, captain?

11:36.173 --> 11:38.717
She was never involved
in the operational phase.

11:38.925 --> 11:41.136
And she specifically
requested today off.

11:41.386 --> 11:43.930
- Why?
- l didn't ask.

11:44.139 --> 11:47.184
Are you suggesting
that she's somehow involved in this?

11:47.392 --> 11:49.144
She's one of my finest officers.

11:49.394 --> 11:52.063
What's next on your checklist?
Do you want me to guess?

11:52.272 --> 11:55.776
We head back to the processing plant
and reschedule our delivery.

11:55.984 --> 11:57.611
Think they'll hit us
on the way back?

11:57.778 --> 12:01.823
l think we ought to find your missing
officer before we move that train again.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.956
l thought you said
she was organized.

12:10.123 --> 12:12.626
Her house looked like
Martha Stewart's jail cell, only neater.

12:12.793 --> 12:14.544
Her hard drive is a mess.

12:14.753 --> 12:16.421
There's subfolders with subfolders,

12:16.588 --> 12:18.381
thousands of files,
all password-protected.

12:18.548 --> 12:21.134
She didn't know
the concept of ''delete.''

12:21.343 --> 12:22.928
Boss, l'm sorry l'm late.

12:24.679 --> 12:26.640
Look who's joined us.
The ghost of David Niven.

12:26.807 --> 12:29.392
l couldn't hear my cell because
of the commotion where l was.

12:29.559 --> 12:31.478
- Where was you?
- lt won't happen again.

12:31.645 --> 12:34.940
- You're right, it won't. Help Abby.
- Help Abby with what?

12:36.233 --> 12:39.069
Okay, l'll have Abby fill me in.

12:39.277 --> 12:40.946
What do we know?

12:41.113 --> 12:44.199
Don't even try to act all normal
dressed like this. Come on.

12:44.366 --> 12:46.827
What is wrong
with what l'm wearing?

12:47.452 --> 12:50.580
You got elbow pads. Look at this.

12:50.789 --> 12:53.792
You're like, ''Mr. Peabody,
where's the Wayback Machine?''

12:54.000 --> 12:56.962
ls there a costume party? lt's like
you're like an English professor.

12:57.129 --> 12:59.131
- What are you doing?
- You finished?

12:59.297 --> 13:01.007
No, l haven't even started yet,
Banacek.

13:01.216 --> 13:03.218
What do you got here?

13:05.637 --> 13:07.222
Oh, you smoke a pipe, McGee?

13:07.389 --> 13:09.766
- l do not--
- This is his writing pipe.

13:09.933 --> 13:12.352
Our McGee fancies himself
a novelist.

13:12.561 --> 13:14.855
- l am a novelist.
- Don't listen to him, McGee.

13:15.021 --> 13:17.858
l think your attire is quite sexy.

13:18.066 --> 13:19.568
Thank you, Ziva.

13:19.776 --> 13:23.238
Can we continue with this or are
you guys gonna make out for a while?

13:25.991 --> 13:27.784
- Can l?
- By all means.

13:27.993 --> 13:30.579
The computer belongs
to an abducted Navy officer.

13:30.745 --> 13:31.997
All her files are encrypted.

13:32.164 --> 13:34.082
She hasn't defragged her drive
since she got it,

13:34.249 --> 13:35.959
- so it'll take time--
- Found something.

13:36.126 --> 13:37.502
- What?
- Electronic date book.

13:37.669 --> 13:38.712
Where?

13:38.879 --> 13:41.465
lt's an icon, centre of the desktop.
l use the same program.

13:41.631 --> 13:45.010
Don't worry, Abby. Sometimes it's hard
to see the jungle through the ferns.

13:46.344 --> 13:49.264
- Right.
- What do we have?

13:49.514 --> 13:52.434
Looks like her last appointment
was today at 8:30 a.m.

13:52.642 --> 13:54.811
A half an hour before she called us.

13:55.103 --> 13:57.647
- lt say where?
- Braddock Mall.

14:03.195 --> 14:05.113
<i>Please take the ticket.</i>

14:05.280 --> 14:07.616
Just out of curiosity,
who taught you to drive?

14:07.824 --> 14:09.159
l did.

14:14.247 --> 14:16.708
On the chance that l can
see something at warp speed,

14:16.875 --> 14:18.543
what kind of car are we looking for?

14:18.710 --> 14:22.255
Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson
drives a 2002 silver Jetta.

14:22.464 --> 14:24.424
- Figures.
- What figures?

14:24.633 --> 14:26.176
- Chick car.
- Meaning?

14:26.384 --> 14:28.470
There are guy cars
and there are chick cars.

14:28.678 --> 14:30.388
lt's a known and irrefutable fact.

14:30.597 --> 14:32.099
Was it a government study?

14:32.891 --> 14:35.852
lt's just a thing you know.
You don't know how, you just do.

14:42.609 --> 14:47.989
Sebring, Liberty, Jetta and Bug,
the whole VW line, all chick.

14:48.156 --> 14:51.243
Mustang, Camaro, Escalade,
PT Cruiser, all guy.

14:51.409 --> 14:53.078
Hummer is very guy,
with adequacy issues.

14:53.245 --> 14:55.747
And then there's some
that go both ways.

14:58.917 --> 15:00.669
lt's an Accord, not a Jetta.

15:02.462 --> 15:03.672
But case in point.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.924
Mini Cooper and Acura
fall in the same category.

15:06.091 --> 15:08.093
You've given this a lot of thought.
lt's very sad.

15:08.260 --> 15:10.512
Well, then there's the Miata.
lt's a special case.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.890
Leans to chick but can go guy.
Usually means he's in denial, though.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.102
Stop!

15:18.103 --> 15:21.982
Gladly, if it means l don't have to listen
to your automobile gender issues.

15:22.190 --> 15:24.025
Plate matches.

15:25.861 --> 15:28.029
<i>Abducted.</i>

15:28.738 --> 15:30.991
The car definitely hit something
in the road.

15:31.199 --> 15:32.367
Play it back again.

15:34.327 --> 15:36.621
l mean,
can you please play it back again?

15:36.830 --> 15:37.956
Better, Timmy.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.418
You're mad at me.

15:41.626 --> 15:45.964
l have better things to do than deal
with your pipe-smoking fetish, McGee.

15:46.173 --> 15:49.551
l told you that l don't smoke it.
lt is purely an inspirational thing.

15:49.759 --> 15:52.304
Whatever. lf you wanna get cancer,
it's not my concern.

15:52.512 --> 15:53.764
Abby, l don't smoke.

15:53.972 --> 15:57.142
The important thing here is to dissect
this tape and try to get something

15:57.350 --> 15:59.394
that will help find Lieutenant
Commander Wilkerson.

15:59.603 --> 16:00.645
Of course.

16:03.857 --> 16:06.693
You're not the only one who came
to work dressed differently today.

16:07.486 --> 16:09.112
l saw Tony and Ziva.

16:09.321 --> 16:11.573
l was talking about me.
Here's a hint.

16:11.782 --> 16:13.200
l'm not one of the Village People.

16:17.245 --> 16:19.790
Oh, no, the Habitat for Humanity
was this weekend?

16:22.042 --> 16:25.962
Abby. Abby, l'm so sorry, okay?
l'm sorry. l completely forgot.

16:26.713 --> 16:27.839
You must hate me.

16:28.048 --> 16:30.008
l could never hate you, McGee.

16:36.264 --> 16:38.016
Don't let it happen again.

16:43.563 --> 16:45.357
There's no commander in here.

16:47.442 --> 16:51.113
- Need any help with that, Tony?
- No, l've got it.

16:51.321 --> 16:54.866
lt's just been a while since
l broke into cars on a regular basis.

16:55.075 --> 16:58.370
- You broke into cars?
- l was a cop in Baltimore.

16:58.578 --> 17:01.623
You stole cars for the police?

17:01.832 --> 17:05.961
No. You wouldn't believe how many
kids lock themselves in by accident.

17:06.169 --> 17:08.922
Or suicides that lock themselves
in on purpose.

17:09.131 --> 17:12.884
Drug addicts who think they're
on a trip, only the car's not moving.

17:13.510 --> 17:16.637
- Old people. l love them--
- Fond memories. Can l try that now?

17:16.847 --> 17:19.641
No. l almost got it.

17:19.849 --> 17:24.396
Just gotta stick it in,
twist it around a little bit.

17:24.771 --> 17:28.023
There it is.
Now l give it a nice firm yank--

17:32.320 --> 17:36.283
Happens with the German cars
sometimes. Be right back.

17:41.413 --> 17:44.499
- No one likes a show-off.
- Got something.

17:48.336 --> 17:50.130
Open up.

17:57.304 --> 17:59.055
Roll the tape.

18:00.599 --> 18:04.060
- l tell you how much l like movies?
- Only several times a day.

18:05.896 --> 18:09.316
<i>lt's Sunday the 1 4th, 0833.</i>

18:09.483 --> 18:12.611
<i>Location, the parking garage
at Braddock Mall.</i>

18:12.778 --> 18:15.155
<i>The agreed-upon meeting place
with my target.</i>

18:15.322 --> 18:17.491
<i>He's promised money
and a place to stay</i>

18:17.657 --> 18:20.535
<i>in exchange
for my willing cooperation.</i>

18:21.745 --> 18:23.747
Why don't l think what she said
is a good thing?

18:23.914 --> 18:25.999
Because you're a better agent
than you are a driver.

18:28.460 --> 18:31.046
Boss, it looks like she used
an lDEA algorithm

18:31.254 --> 18:33.590
to generate a short key
for some of the files.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.592
Got the software working now.

18:35.842 --> 18:39.846
<i>As for the rest, l am condensing
like extensions into their own subsets.</i>

18:40.055 --> 18:42.265
<i>- ln English, McGee.
- l am working on</i>

18:42.474 --> 18:45.727
opening the locked files
and establishing protocol.

18:45.936 --> 18:49.147
Gibbs, what he's trying to say
is that there's a crap load of stuff.

18:49.356 --> 18:51.900
<i>The sheer volume
of material is daunting.</i>

18:52.109 --> 18:54.444
Even for a guy in a turtleneck.

18:54.653 --> 18:57.447
<i>- But l'm working it as fast as l can.
- Work faster, McGee.</i>

18:57.614 --> 19:00.033
lf she's still in the car trunk,
we have 8 hours to find her

19:00.242 --> 19:04.162
- till she runs out of air.
- That's not strictly accurate, Jethro.

19:04.371 --> 19:08.041
l was on the 9th with a shot at a
$1 0 Nassau when Abby called.

19:08.250 --> 19:11.628
She wanted to make certain
her survival figures were accurate.

19:11.795 --> 19:12.963
How far off were they, Duck?

19:13.171 --> 19:16.800
Well, they were spot on,
but something she said bothered me.

19:17.384 --> 19:21.304
She arrived at her figures based on
a young woman in good health.

19:21.513 --> 19:23.140
Well, given the dire circumstances,

19:23.390 --> 19:26.893
l thought it best to verify that
that was, in fact, the case.

19:27.060 --> 19:28.478
Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson

19:28.687 --> 19:33.233
was treated for acute bronchitis
by an intern at the base two days ago.

19:33.442 --> 19:35.610
With her lungs
in that condition, well,

19:35.819 --> 19:38.530
they would not be operating
as efficiently as normal.

19:38.738 --> 19:42.325
- How long?
- Her survival time would be shortened

19:42.534 --> 19:44.077
by several hours.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.896
- You've been so helpful. l don't know--
- DiNozzo.

20:11.104 --> 20:13.940
l hope that was background
on Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson.

20:14.107 --> 20:15.776
l talked to everyone
in her command.

20:15.942 --> 20:17.944
They think she's clean.
Not much social life.

20:18.111 --> 20:20.489
Spends half her time at work,
half at home on her computer.

20:20.655 --> 20:22.282
She's basically a McGee.

20:22.449 --> 20:25.786
He's not responsible for the movement
of nuclear fuel rods across country.

20:25.952 --> 20:27.537
And McGee didn't make
a personal video

20:27.704 --> 20:29.831
about money and transport
to a safe house.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.168
What's with that video? lt doesn't make
any more sense than that phone call.

20:33.335 --> 20:38.548
They both accomplished one thing.
The train is no longer mobile.

20:39.841 --> 20:42.928
Navy can't risk moving it until
they find out what happened to her.

20:43.970 --> 20:46.014
- Navy.
- Yeah.

20:46.223 --> 20:47.307
As in us!

20:48.975 --> 20:52.479
- Boss, l think l have something here.
- Show me, McGee.

20:52.646 --> 20:54.231
l'm not 1 00 percent sure
it's anything,

20:54.397 --> 20:56.274
but l found something
that could possibly help.

20:56.441 --> 20:58.110
- Show me.
- Wilkerson's e-mail log

20:58.276 --> 21:01.113
shows that she sent 1 4 messages
from the same location last night.

21:01.279 --> 21:02.948
lt wasn't her home lSP.

21:03.115 --> 21:06.034
- l can't read that.
- lt's encrypted.

21:06.868 --> 21:09.746
- Then un-crypt it.
- Abby and l are working on it.

21:10.497 --> 21:11.998
Why am l sitting here
looking at you?

21:12.165 --> 21:13.834
l thought that it might
be helpful to know

21:14.000 --> 21:16.461
that Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson
sent all these emails

21:16.628 --> 21:19.131
from a store called PBJ.
at the Braddock Mall in Fairfax.

21:19.297 --> 21:21.007
Wilkerson could suffocate
at any time,

21:21.174 --> 21:23.760
and you couldn't tell me this
with a phone call, McGee?

21:24.010 --> 21:26.263
Well, l could. l should've.

21:32.185 --> 21:33.728
- Hi.
- Hello.

21:33.979 --> 21:35.856
Can l help you?

21:36.189 --> 21:39.776
NClS, l'm Agent DiNozzo,
this is Officer David.

21:40.026 --> 21:42.779
- lt stands for Naval Criminal--
- lnvestigative Service.

21:43.029 --> 21:45.240
We've worked with NClS before.

21:45.490 --> 21:48.618
l'm Ross Logan.
l run this chapter of PBJ.

21:48.869 --> 21:50.078
Peanut butter and jelly, yes?

21:50.287 --> 21:53.582
Actually, no. lt stands
for Perverts Brought to Justice.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.126
We're a non-profit
that helps law enforcement

21:56.293 --> 21:57.794
track down online paedophiles.

21:57.961 --> 21:59.045
That was my second guess.

22:00.505 --> 22:01.548
That's Amanda Wilkerson.

22:02.883 --> 22:04.009
ls she in trouble?

22:04.217 --> 22:06.052
- She's been--
- Why ask if she's in trouble?

22:06.219 --> 22:07.888
- l guess past experience.
- Meaning...?

22:08.054 --> 22:10.724
Meaning we have a strict policy
to only monitor suspected abusers.

22:10.891 --> 22:13.560
We never confront.
That's obviously your job.

22:13.727 --> 22:16.646
l'm gonna take a wild stab and say
Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson

22:16.897 --> 22:18.940
- didn't always follow policy.
- lnitially, no.

22:19.107 --> 22:21.276
She had a few confrontations
with some of our targets.

22:21.443 --> 22:23.653
One ended up suing us
for harassment.

22:23.904 --> 22:27.073
- How long did she volunteer here?
- She started about two years ago.

22:27.240 --> 22:30.577
Ever since her 1 4-year-old niece
was raped by an online predator.

22:30.744 --> 22:33.413
- What's she done now?
- Gone missing.

22:33.622 --> 22:36.041
Her e-mail records say
she was here last night.

22:36.917 --> 22:40.170
She was. The 8-to-midnight shift.

22:40.420 --> 22:42.589
Last couple weeks,
she's been working a pervert

22:42.756 --> 22:44.925
with the screen name
''Fleet Captain.''

22:45.092 --> 22:46.760
He thinks Amanda's 1 4.

22:46.927 --> 22:49.137
But there's a transcript
of last night's conversation.

22:49.304 --> 22:51.556
lt's very...explicit.

22:51.723 --> 22:54.226
- More like sickening.
- They're called perverts for a reason.

22:54.392 --> 22:56.853
- You got an address for this freak?
- Unfortunately, no.

22:57.020 --> 23:00.190
His connections route through a dozen
different lSPs and they change nightly.

23:00.524 --> 23:02.067
Gonna need your server
and files, then.

23:02.234 --> 23:04.152
Our best hackers
haven't been able to track him.

23:04.319 --> 23:06.363
- You haven't met our hacker.
- He's good?

23:06.613 --> 23:08.198
Does a bear sit in the woods?

23:08.448 --> 23:10.450
Are you the crackerjack team
on this job?

23:10.617 --> 23:12.077
She's lsraeli.

23:12.244 --> 23:14.371
Look, l know l got
the bear thing right.

23:22.838 --> 23:24.214
What can l do to help, McGee?

23:24.464 --> 23:26.883
You can stop touching things
when you're not grounded.

23:27.134 --> 23:28.343
Right, sorry.

23:28.593 --> 23:30.387
Hack away.
You won't even notice me here.

23:30.637 --> 23:32.222
Okay, but you're standing
on my foot.

23:32.472 --> 23:34.850
Thought it was a cable.
My apologies once again.

23:35.100 --> 23:37.310
Sure there isn't something
you wanna help Abby with?

23:37.519 --> 23:40.147
No. l wish to improve
my computer skills.

23:40.355 --> 23:42.607
So come on, hacky-sacky.

23:43.608 --> 23:45.152
Right.

23:53.618 --> 23:55.912
l isolated the sound
of the commander's phone call.

23:56.163 --> 23:57.998
What do you think?

24:01.359 --> 24:03.987
The ''thunk'' sort of sounds like metal.

24:05.030 --> 24:07.449
You don't think l haven't
already ''thunk'' that, Tony?

24:07.616 --> 24:08.700
Why'd you ask me to listen?

24:08.909 --> 24:10.911
l went to a Plastic Death concert
last night.

24:11.119 --> 24:13.246
l couldn't even hear my alarm.
l wanna be sure.

24:13.413 --> 24:15.582
Oh, play it again.

24:19.794 --> 24:21.463
- A train track?
- Yes.

24:21.630 --> 24:23.381
Railroad tracks would be
the obvious choice,

24:23.548 --> 24:26.009
but there isn't a second ''thunk''
or a ''thack,''

24:26.176 --> 24:28.011
not even a ''thock'' on that track.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.597
Have you been reading a lot
of Dr. Seuss books?

24:30.805 --> 24:32.724
You know l love me
some Theodor Geisel.

24:35.185 --> 24:39.314
<i>- You'll have to speak up, ma'am.
- l've been abducted.</i>

24:40.357 --> 24:42.150
l think l heard something
after the ''thunk,''

24:42.317 --> 24:44.694
but the scream kind of covers it.
Can you erase that part?

24:44.861 --> 24:47.489
No, but l can mess
with the frequencies.

24:47.656 --> 24:50.075
The sound you heard, was it higher
or lower than her scream?

24:50.242 --> 24:54.371
<i>- Lower.
- l've been abducted.</i>

24:57.415 --> 24:58.541
lt was a railroad track.

24:58.708 --> 25:02.003
Her scream was covering the ''thunk.''
l need to wear earplugs at concerts.

25:02.170 --> 25:06.508
Okay, the commander was
at the Braddock Mall at 8:30 a.m.

25:06.675 --> 25:09.928
Crossed railroad tracks
20 minutes later.

25:11.263 --> 25:15.392
There. Those are the only railroad
tracks within 1 5 miles of the mall.

25:15.976 --> 25:18.770
Ox Road. That's good work, Abby.

25:19.229 --> 25:20.772
Assuming Abby is correct,

25:20.939 --> 25:23.108
the vehicle harbouring
Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson

25:23.275 --> 25:25.193
left the mall via Ox Road.

25:25.360 --> 25:28.071
The car travelled southbound,
passing three gas stations,

25:28.238 --> 25:30.365
a Wal-Mart
and this Lexus dealership.

25:30.532 --> 25:33.285
2.6 miles later
they passed by this bank,

25:33.451 --> 25:36.246
just before crossing
the Dungy Street railroad tracks.

25:36.413 --> 25:38.498
How many times you pass Go?

25:39.291 --> 25:40.750
Collect your $200?

25:40.959 --> 25:43.128
You know, Monopoly, the board game?
lt's American.

25:45.422 --> 25:49.259
Ox Road eventually comes to an end
at the luxury living community

25:49.467 --> 25:50.594
of Terra Trace Estates.

25:50.760 --> 25:54.014
The Fairfax police are now focusing
their search on this central area.

25:54.180 --> 25:58.268
They estimate between 8 to 9 hours
for a thorough search.

25:58.977 --> 26:01.271
Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson
doesn't have that long.

26:01.479 --> 26:04.316
Which is why l tracked down
the only available surveillance video

26:04.482 --> 26:06.776
on or near Ox Road.

26:06.943 --> 26:08.278
Hit the little right button.

26:10.155 --> 26:12.532
This is the internal security camera

26:12.699 --> 26:15.118
of a Northern Virginia
Savings and Trust ATM.

26:15.327 --> 26:18.914
Now, it sits about 300 yards north
of the train tracks at Ox Road, right?

26:19.122 --> 26:21.791
Now, we know the car passed
over the tracks at 0904.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.711
Speed limit is 35 miles per hour.

26:24.961 --> 26:28.715
We gotta assume our abductor didn't
wanna attract attention by speeding.

26:28.965 --> 26:32.636
Our car should be passing
this camera around--

26:32.802 --> 26:35.472
Hold on a second.
Carry the seven. Divide by six--

26:35.639 --> 26:37.474
Right, here.

26:39.017 --> 26:41.645
- l'm switching banks.
- You really think she's hot?

26:41.811 --> 26:44.689
She's a perfect 1 0 with a great--

26:45.315 --> 26:47.233
l saw that.
Why'd you give her the soft touch?

26:48.652 --> 26:50.862
- Thank you, boss.
- ls that the best shot you can get?

26:51.071 --> 26:53.156
There's a few frames
just after she blocks our view

26:53.323 --> 26:55.533
with her incredible figure.

26:56.326 --> 26:59.496
That's a 1 989 Mercedes
560 SEL, boss.

26:59.663 --> 27:01.331
l can't see the plate.

27:01.498 --> 27:04.376
Well, use your little clicker
and zoom in.

27:05.335 --> 27:08.004
That first number's either
an eight or a six.

27:08.171 --> 27:09.506
lt's an eight.

27:10.006 --> 27:12.759
With all due respect, sir, your eyesight
isn't exactly your strong--

27:13.885 --> 27:16.221
863 Romeo Charlie Tango.

27:16.471 --> 27:19.557
Nine cars reported stolen
from Northern Virginia this morning.

27:19.766 --> 27:21.476
One is a Benz 560 SEL.

27:21.685 --> 27:25.188
- William Lafferty, Fairfax, Virginia.
- Move it.

27:33.530 --> 27:35.198
How long has your car
been missing?

27:35.365 --> 27:39.536
Well, l just reported it missing
this morning.

27:40.579 --> 27:42.539
l went out to get the paper

27:42.747 --> 27:44.708
- and it was gone.
- When did you last see it?

27:47.002 --> 27:48.920
Last night around 9.

27:49.129 --> 27:52.507
- l came back from renting a movie.
- What movie?

27:53.550 --> 27:55.260
- Does it matter?
- Oh, yeah.

27:55.510 --> 27:59.639
- The title's kind of embarrassing.
- Back of the store? Triple X?

27:59.889 --> 28:03.059
<i>- No.
- Weekend at Bernie's Part Two.</i>

28:03.226 --> 28:04.769
That's even worse.

28:04.936 --> 28:08.607
- Anyone else have keys to your car?
- No, l live alone.

28:08.815 --> 28:10.066
Someone stole my car

28:10.233 --> 28:13.403
- and used it in a crime, right?
- What makes you think that?

28:13.570 --> 28:17.616
Three feds looking for a stolen
'89 Mercedes. l'm not an idiot.

28:17.824 --> 28:19.409
- You've been home all morning?
- Yeah.

28:19.576 --> 28:22.037
- What happened?
- Can anyone verify that?

28:23.830 --> 28:27.250
l didn't have anything
to do with whatever shooting

28:27.417 --> 28:30.045
- or robbery my car was in.
- Yeah, Gibbs.

28:30.253 --> 28:31.838
<i>Boss, hey, l picked up a trace on...</i>

28:32.005 --> 28:34.132
Lionfish, trigger and clown.
l breed them.

28:34.925 --> 28:36.551
l hate clowns.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.136
Good work, McGee.
We're on our way.

28:38.303 --> 28:39.846
Someone's using
Wilkerson's cell phone.

28:40.013 --> 28:41.598
McGee's getting a fix.

28:41.765 --> 28:43.934
- What about my car?
- We'll call you.

28:44.142 --> 28:47.103
<i>Keep going. Keep going.</i>

28:47.270 --> 28:49.189
<i>Okay, it's directly north
of you right now.</i>

28:49.439 --> 28:51.816
<i>You should be right by him, boss.
Phone's still in use.</i>

28:52.067 --> 28:53.151
Yeah, l got it, McGee.

28:53.860 --> 28:56.780
Signal's coming from
1 00 yards of here. lt's still active.

29:15.090 --> 29:16.925
- Freeze! NClS!
- Don't shoot.

29:17.092 --> 29:19.052
<i>- lt's not our beer.
- Hello? Danny?</i>

29:19.219 --> 29:20.637
Yeah, we found it.

29:20.804 --> 29:22.472
<i>- Danny?
- Who's on the phone?</i>

29:23.640 --> 29:25.600
- My girlfriend?
- Hi.

29:25.809 --> 29:27.143
Oh, my God,
don't touch me there.

29:27.852 --> 29:30.647
He's gonna have to call you back.
Bye.

29:30.814 --> 29:32.023
You're busted.

29:42.926 --> 29:45.637
Definitely Lieutenant Commander
Wilkerson's cell phone, boss.

29:45.803 --> 29:47.347
Five calls made in the last hour.

29:47.555 --> 29:50.391
Two to an adult chat line.
Three to a teenage girl in Manassas.

29:50.558 --> 29:52.810
Coordinate with the locals.
l want the park searched.

29:53.019 --> 29:54.562
Sheriff's department is en route.

29:54.771 --> 29:56.856
They say they bought their phones
from another boy.

29:57.065 --> 29:59.025
- This boy have a name?
- l'm sure he does.

29:59.192 --> 30:02.403
- They, however, claim not to know it.
- They also claim this isn't their beer.

30:02.570 --> 30:04.113
You don't think l know they're lying?

30:04.864 --> 30:07.325
Thank you, because l do.

30:07.533 --> 30:10.161
- They're only children.
- Actually, they're teenagers.

30:10.370 --> 30:12.497
Whatever. The little one
was about to cry.

30:12.664 --> 30:14.082
You have to draw the line
somewhere.

30:14.248 --> 30:17.210
l mean, these boys are not
potential suicide bombers.

30:18.419 --> 30:20.296
And l don't interrogate children.

30:20.546 --> 30:23.549
No, you don't, Ziva.

30:23.716 --> 30:25.260
You talk to them.

30:27.553 --> 30:30.473
Why would Commander Wilkerson
pretend to be a 1 4-year-old girl?

30:30.682 --> 30:33.977
She was luring an online predator into
a meet at Braddock Mall this morning.

30:34.143 --> 30:36.729
Her disappearance has nothing to do
with the fuel-rod shipment?

30:36.896 --> 30:38.314
- Maybe.
- The e-mails could be

30:38.481 --> 30:40.358
the way she communicates
with her cell.

30:40.525 --> 30:42.694
ln a paedophilia chat room
on the lnternet?

30:42.902 --> 30:44.153
Give me a break.

30:44.362 --> 30:46.155
Your response, captain,
is the exact reason

30:46.364 --> 30:48.658
why intelligence operatives
use such methods.

30:49.575 --> 30:50.910
You still think there's a threat?

30:52.203 --> 30:56.082
That train doesn't move
until we find the commander.

31:01.212 --> 31:02.630
We didn't know
the phone was stolen.

31:02.797 --> 31:05.133
We bought it from a guy
we know at school.

31:05.925 --> 31:11.139
- l want the name, Beavis.
- We don't, like, ''know'' know him.

31:11.306 --> 31:15.184
Yeah, meaning
we don't exactly know his name.

31:16.269 --> 31:21.107
Well, l, like, think you're, like, totally,
like, lying, like.

31:21.316 --> 31:23.860
- You wanna know why?
- Because you're old?

31:27.488 --> 31:32.118
Funny guy. You're playing
a dangerous game, small fry.

31:32.285 --> 31:34.203
Ops. Yeah, it's DiNozzo.

31:34.412 --> 31:37.665
Hey, Mattie. l need to requisition
two sets of genital cuffs,

31:37.874 --> 31:42.295
and l gotta requisition
the mark-5 Taser again.

31:42.503 --> 31:45.882
No, you don't have to clean them.
l'll wear rubber gloves. Thanks.

31:47.425 --> 31:49.427
l'm thirsty.
Can l get you something to drink?

31:50.178 --> 31:51.387
You really should,

31:51.554 --> 31:54.182
because interrogation
makes you a little dehydrated.

31:55.767 --> 31:58.311
Okay. Oh, before l forget.

31:58.519 --> 32:02.231
Any history of testicular cancer
or high blood pressure in the family?

32:03.399 --> 32:06.444
Okay, you know what? You guys
think about that for a second.

32:06.653 --> 32:07.904
l'm gonna do a little refill,

32:08.154 --> 32:10.531
and we'll talk about
the boring stuff later, funny guys.

32:13.952 --> 32:16.287
- Genital cuffs?
- Steve Martin, Michael Caine,

32:16.454 --> 32:19.040
<i>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.</i>

32:19.248 --> 32:21.250
- Great.
- Whatever. lt's working.

32:21.459 --> 32:22.502
<i>We have to tell them.</i>

32:22.710 --> 32:24.879
<i>He's bluffing. There's no such thing
as genital cuffs.</i>

32:25.088 --> 32:27.840
- What if there is?
- lf Geck finds out we ratted on him?

32:28.007 --> 32:30.718
These guys aren't even cops. They're
some secret government agency.

32:30.885 --> 32:32.845
You see the way she was
playing with her knife?

32:33.012 --> 32:36.266
<i>Yeah, l know. lt was kind of hot,
like Salma Hayek in Desperado.</i>

32:36.474 --> 32:37.725
Never seen that.

32:39.394 --> 32:41.729
All right.

32:41.938 --> 32:44.524
- That's for the number.
- What number?

32:45.525 --> 32:47.277
Geck's, Beavis.

32:47.902 --> 32:51.281
Write. Write. Write, write, write.

32:54.742 --> 32:58.037
And that is how you interrogate kids.

33:00.331 --> 33:02.500
This guy's not
your average pervert, Abs.

33:02.709 --> 33:04.752
He's got some serious
programming skills.

33:04.961 --> 33:07.380
- Well, so do we.
- That might not be enough this time.

33:07.547 --> 33:09.090
Don't say that, McGee.

33:09.257 --> 33:11.009
Commander Wilkerson's
almost out of time.

33:12.260 --> 33:14.721
Damn it. l keep losing
his connection in Madrid.

33:14.887 --> 33:17.140
Okay, that's it.
You need a break.

33:17.348 --> 33:20.810
- We don't have time for breaks, Abby.
- We don't, but you do.

33:21.019 --> 33:23.813
How many times have l told you
he's not a toy?

33:23.980 --> 33:25.815
Hi, Gibbs.
He's getting a little stressed out.

33:26.024 --> 33:29.110
So am l. Tell me you two
have found ''Captain Pervert.''

33:29.319 --> 33:31.070
lt's ''Fleet Captain Pervert.''

33:31.237 --> 33:33.531
And we keep losing
his computer's connection in Spain.

33:33.740 --> 33:35.783
- Un-lose it.
- lt doesn't work that way.

33:35.950 --> 33:39.037
lt's true. The servers are down, we
can't pick up his trace without them.

33:39.245 --> 33:41.789
Pick it up somewhere else.
Look, we already know

33:41.956 --> 33:43.374
this guy is somewhere
in Virginia,

33:43.541 --> 33:45.752
otherwise he couldn't have
shown up at Braddock Mall.

33:45.918 --> 33:47.503
We also know
he stole a car this morning

33:47.670 --> 33:48.963
from a home in Fairfax County.

33:49.881 --> 33:52.050
- Why didn't you think of that?
- Me? What about you?

33:52.258 --> 33:54.510
- Can you find him or not?
- lf he's in Fairfax--

33:54.677 --> 33:56.429
Then we can match
his computer's profile

33:56.596 --> 33:59.599
- against lSP node service in the area.
- Maybe an hour, Gibbs.

33:59.766 --> 34:01.517
- Good, You have--
- Twenty minutes, l know.

34:01.684 --> 34:03.853
- We know.
- l was gonna say 1 0.

34:14.989 --> 34:17.574
Look, we need to know
where your son is, Mr. Geckler.

34:17.784 --> 34:19.953
Well, where does
he usually hang out on Sundays?

34:20.161 --> 34:22.746
<i>- Braddock Mall and in an arcade.
- Okay.</i>

34:22.914 --> 34:24.248
Well, if he gets home,

34:24.415 --> 34:27.668
tell him he can't leave,
and you call me. Thank you.

34:27.918 --> 34:29.545
He appears to be a busy
young man.

34:29.795 --> 34:31.505
He's also our only link
to the commander.

34:31.714 --> 34:34.884
Not anymore. Give the kid's stuff
to McGee. We found the pervert.

34:35.092 --> 34:36.135
Where?

34:36.344 --> 34:40.639
The computer he was using traces
back to 23346 Maple Street.

34:40.848 --> 34:44.060
- Mr. Clown-Fish?
- William Lafferty?

34:44.310 --> 34:45.645
Come on, let's roll.

34:56.697 --> 34:58.574
Just give me 1 0 seconds and l'll--

35:01.869 --> 35:02.954
DiNozzo, we're in position.

35:05.790 --> 35:07.792
<i>And all Ron does is spray.</i>

35:07.959 --> 35:13.464
<i>Ron, what if this gets on some
area of our skin that we don't want it?</i>

35:13.631 --> 35:15.758
- DiNozzo coming in.
- Clear.

35:15.967 --> 35:19.846
Back of the house is clear, boss.
Looks like this guy left in a hurry.

35:20.013 --> 35:23.349
- You think, DiNozzo?
- And he won't be coming back.

35:27.854 --> 35:30.356
- Bleach.
- He poisoned his fish?

35:30.523 --> 35:32.066
Because he couldn't take them
with him.

35:32.275 --> 35:34.485
These fish
were his prized possessions.

35:34.694 --> 35:37.196
lf he can't have them, no one can.

35:37.405 --> 35:39.365
Fits the profile
of a malignant narcissist.

35:39.532 --> 35:41.743
- Spread out.
- What are we looking for, Gibbs?

35:41.909 --> 35:43.911
Anything that will tell us
where this freak went.

35:55.173 --> 35:57.091
Jason Geckler.

35:57.342 --> 35:58.801
My name's Special Agent McGee,
NClS.

35:58.968 --> 36:01.262
Like l told your other agents,
l'm not saying anything

36:01.471 --> 36:02.847
until my dad gets here.

36:03.473 --> 36:05.934
He's on his way.
He also said that he expects you

36:06.142 --> 36:08.394
- to give us your full cooperation.
- Yeah?

36:08.603 --> 36:10.855
And how do l know
that you really talked to him?

36:11.940 --> 36:14.359
He wanted me to remind you

36:14.525 --> 36:18.863
that Winthrop Military Academy
is still accepting applications.

36:19.072 --> 36:21.032
He would never send me there.

36:22.116 --> 36:24.494
lt kind of costs money, dude.

36:32.919 --> 36:34.003
Look familiar?

36:35.588 --> 36:38.633
lt was being used
by two of your classmates,

36:38.883 --> 36:42.262
a Timothy Griffin
and Daniel Austin.

36:42.470 --> 36:44.097
They said they got it from you.

36:44.305 --> 36:45.390
Did they, now?

36:45.556 --> 36:49.394
Well, l'll just have to be sure to thank
them for that when l get home.

36:49.978 --> 36:51.980
Look, a woman's life
is at stake here, okay?

36:52.188 --> 36:54.482
l need to know
where you got the phone.

37:05.910 --> 37:09.622
Tim and Dan, they must be
pretty scared of you, huh?

37:10.707 --> 37:12.625
What makes you say that?

37:12.834 --> 37:15.253
Come on.
They're obviously geeks.

37:15.461 --> 37:17.213
We used to shove them into lockers,

37:17.422 --> 37:19.799
pull their gym shorts off in class,

37:20.008 --> 37:21.718
drop their books down the toilet.

37:23.344 --> 37:26.014
lt's even better
if they start crying, right?

37:27.557 --> 37:29.017
Or wet their pants.

37:31.185 --> 37:34.272
Yeah, well, that too.

37:36.065 --> 37:37.317
You know what the best part is?

37:37.525 --> 37:39.902
When you get older, you're not
gonna remember their names,

37:40.069 --> 37:42.614
but you know what? They're always
gonna remember yours.

37:42.822 --> 37:44.365
That's pretty cool, huh?

37:45.491 --> 37:48.620
You know, l really haven't thought
about it too much.

37:51.748 --> 37:53.082
Well, l have.

37:53.958 --> 37:56.836
You know why?
Because l was one of those kids.

37:57.045 --> 38:00.506
And l've been looking forward
to this day my entire life, dirtbag.

38:00.715 --> 38:02.091
But l didn't do anything.

38:02.258 --> 38:04.177
l got you for aiding
and abetting a kidnapping,

38:04.344 --> 38:07.805
interfering in a Federal investigation
and selling stolen property.

38:08.681 --> 38:10.016
You know what that means?

38:10.224 --> 38:13.269
That means they can try you
as an adult, Geck.

38:13.478 --> 38:14.896
And when you're in prison,

38:15.104 --> 38:17.482
every night when you're
crying yourself to sleep,

38:17.690 --> 38:20.151
l want you to think of me, tough guy.

38:21.527 --> 38:23.988
We're done here.

38:24.155 --> 38:26.407
- See you in court.
- Wait, wait, wait.

38:26.616 --> 38:28.910
Look, l found it, all right?

38:29.118 --> 38:30.703
l can show you where.

38:36.209 --> 38:37.835
BOLO's out on Lafferty, boss.

38:38.628 --> 38:41.172
And his passport expired.
He can't leave the country.

38:42.215 --> 38:44.509
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Boss, l just spoke with Geckler.

38:44.717 --> 38:46.803
He said he found the phone
at around noon today.

38:47.428 --> 38:50.640
- Where, McGee?
- The Braddock Mall parking garage.

38:50.807 --> 38:52.600
Lafferty must have driven
her back there.

38:55.561 --> 38:57.939
- Where we going now, boss?
- The mall.

39:00.024 --> 39:01.693
And they have a problem
with my driving?

39:20.378 --> 39:21.921
Drop your weapon.

39:22.589 --> 39:25.216
- NClS. Get down on your knees!
- Okay, okay. All right.

39:25.383 --> 39:27.635
- Put your hands on your head!
- Okay.

39:29.512 --> 39:31.889
- You let me know if l'm hurting you.
- lt hurts. lt hurts.

39:32.056 --> 39:33.224
Good.

39:34.976 --> 39:36.102
Squeegee gun?

39:37.770 --> 39:39.731
l was only trying
to teach her a lesson.

39:40.565 --> 39:41.899
Ross Logan, boss.

39:42.066 --> 39:44.193
The man who runs
Perverts Brought to Justice.

39:44.402 --> 39:46.946
l knew she was gonna confront
Fleet Captain, so l followed her.

39:47.113 --> 39:49.407
You kidnapped her and locked her
in the trunk of a car.

39:49.616 --> 39:52.619
To scare her. That's all.
l came back. l was letting her out.

39:52.827 --> 39:55.705
Look, we have rules for a reason.
Breaking them could get her killed.

39:55.913 --> 39:59.083
She's on her way
to Bethesda in a coma, Logan.

40:01.586 --> 40:03.171
Hey!

40:04.422 --> 40:07.842
<i>Look, l never meant
for Amanda to get hurt.</i>

40:08.092 --> 40:09.802
<i>l'll be sure to tell her that
if she lives.</i>

40:09.969 --> 40:11.804
<i>Why do you think l parked the car
at the mall?</i>

40:11.971 --> 40:14.432
<i>- l wanted someone to find her.
- Where's Lafferty?</i>

40:14.599 --> 40:16.100
- Who?
- Fleet Captain.

40:16.267 --> 40:18.269
- How would l know?
- You were working with him.

40:19.103 --> 40:20.647
Are you insane?

40:20.855 --> 40:23.816
l've dedicated my life to putting
perverts like that behind bars.

40:24.025 --> 40:25.485
You were driving his car.

40:25.693 --> 40:28.863
Because when l confronted him
at the garage, the guy just took off.

40:29.113 --> 40:30.657
- Without his car?
- They're cowards.

40:30.865 --> 40:31.908
<i>lt's pretty common.</i>

40:32.116 --> 40:35.995
<i>Oh, really? ls it also common
to kidnap your co-worker?</i>

40:37.205 --> 40:39.248
l had to make a choice.

40:40.208 --> 40:44.128
We provide you with the transcripts
of them soliciting sex from minors.

40:44.295 --> 40:47.006
We give you their names,
their addresses,

40:47.215 --> 40:50.051
and you know what happens
most of the time? You let them walk.

40:50.969 --> 40:53.388
- ls that true, McGee?
- Well, the system isn't perfect.

40:53.638 --> 40:55.473
The punishment doesn't
fit the crime.

40:55.640 --> 40:58.351
Personally, l prefer simpler ways
of handling things.

40:58.559 --> 41:00.353
l don't suppose
any of those ways are legal.

41:01.062 --> 41:02.647
<i>So you decided to frame him?</i>

41:02.814 --> 41:04.357
Amanda spends a few hours
in a trunk,

41:04.524 --> 41:06.526
Fleet Captain spends
at least 1 0 years in prison.

41:06.693 --> 41:08.736
That sounds like a fair trade to me.

41:09.320 --> 41:11.572
Look, monsters
like Lafferty destroy lives.

41:11.739 --> 41:13.366
That guy deserves to be in prison.

41:13.574 --> 41:17.161
Be patient. You may see him there
before you get out.

41:19.414 --> 41:20.832
This is classic.

41:21.040 --> 41:24.043
l go to jail while he's free
to find a real 1 4-year-old.

41:24.252 --> 41:26.838
You think that's justice,
Agent Gibbs?

41:33.720 --> 41:36.306
- Where's the boss-man?
- Think he went home.

41:36.514 --> 41:37.807
He never leaves before l do.

41:38.016 --> 41:40.518
- lt's been a long Sunday, Abby.
- Alrighty.

41:40.727 --> 41:42.228
Just got off the phone
with Bethesda.

41:42.395 --> 41:44.439
Commander Wilkerson
is a little dehydrated,

41:44.606 --> 41:46.107
but otherwise doing just fine.

41:46.316 --> 41:49.777
So you could say today
would qualify as a success.

41:49.986 --> 41:52.405
Except we let a pervert get away.

41:53.740 --> 41:56.492
Gibbs went home
with a child molester on the loose?

41:56.701 --> 42:00.204
- There's no way.
- You're right.

42:00.371 --> 42:01.497
Then where is he?

42:10.048 --> 42:13.051
The paedophile's at the front of the line
putting his bag on the belt now.

42:13.217 --> 42:15.720
<i>- Get him.
- Roger that, Agent Gibbs.</i>

42:18.473 --> 42:21.100
<i>- Grab him.
- l got him.</i>

42:21.309 --> 42:22.810
<i>Let go of me!</i>

42:24.228 --> 42:25.980
<i>- Come on.
-Stay back.</i>

42:26.272 --> 42:27.774
<i>We have everything under control.</i>

42:28.399 --> 42:29.859
<i>All right, let's go.</i>
