12:22.359 --> 12:24.259
- Lilly, we gotta
get back to the White House.

12:24.394 --> 12:25.760
- Wait, what? Why?

12:25.896 --> 12:27.729
- I'll explain everything
once I get back.

12:27.864 --> 12:29.297
- What? No.
- Look...

12:29.433 --> 12:30.732
- No.
No, don't, don't,

12:30.867 --> 12:33.435
don't leave me here. Please.
You guys can't.

12:36.706 --> 12:38.473
- If anybody comes
through that door,

12:38.608 --> 12:39.808
you shoot to kill.

12:39.943 --> 12:41.609
- Well, make sure
it's not housekeeping.

12:41.745 --> 12:44.546
- She knows the difference.
- You sure about that?

12:44.681 --> 12:47.916
- Max, why don't you
go wait for me in the car?

12:48.051 --> 12:49.884
- I'm giving you three minutes.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.720
- All I need is one.
All right, I'll be there.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.956
Wait for me.
- He's waiting for you.

12:55.091 --> 12:57.058
- Damn it! Max.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.893
- One minute.

13:00.897 --> 13:03.598
- Do you have to leave me?

13:03.733 --> 13:06.134
- I'll be right back.

13:06.269 --> 13:11.139
- All right.
He tried to kill me, Bobby.

13:11.274 --> 13:15.243
- He tried to get information.
- Wait. How do you know that?

13:15.378 --> 13:17.011
- It's what they all do.

13:19.950 --> 13:24.419
- I can't believe he left me
in Kyle's hands.

13:24.554 --> 13:28.122
- Lilly, I promise you,
I will kill that son of a bitch.

13:28.258 --> 13:30.058
- No.

13:30.193 --> 13:32.660
- No?

13:32.796 --> 13:34.529
- You have to let me do it.

13:37.367 --> 13:39.968
- I will if Max
doesn't kill him first.

13:40.103 --> 13:41.703
- No.

13:45.208 --> 13:49.944
Just get him to me.
That's all I ask.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.579
That's all.

13:54.284 --> 13:57.619
- I'll work on that.
I gotta go.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.588
- All right.

14:00.724 --> 14:03.091
Am I safe?

14:03.226 --> 14:06.261
- I swear to you, you are.
Okay?

14:09.733 --> 14:11.766
- Okay.

14:11.902 --> 14:13.935
- I'll be back.
- Thank you.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.310
- I'll be right back.

14:25.248 --> 14:27.181
- MAX: Yep.

14:27.317 --> 14:29.751
Enough with the
damn romance bullshit.

14:29.886 --> 14:31.719
- Weren't you supposed
to be at the car?

14:31.855 --> 14:34.088
- Yeah, well, I couldn't
count on your ass to be there.

14:34.224 --> 14:35.990
I was right, so come on.

14:44.267 --> 14:45.533
- Go ahead.

14:45.669 --> 14:51.606
- ♪

15:07.724 --> 15:10.658
- You don't eat much.

15:10.794 --> 15:12.627
- I'm not very hungry.

15:15.065 --> 15:19.267
- Well, in that case,
let's chat.

15:19.402 --> 15:23.071
- Hmm. I thought you didn't
feel like doing that.

15:23.206 --> 15:28.309
- Oh, I don't.
But this is a monologue.

15:28.445 --> 15:31.412
Shall I begin?

15:31.548 --> 15:33.982
- By all means.

15:34.117 --> 15:36.317
- Not that I
needed your permission.

15:38.822 --> 15:41.823
Your husband has leveled
some extraordinary claims

15:41.958 --> 15:45.093
against me and my husband.

15:45.228 --> 15:49.397
- Well, I'm sorry, but I don't
know anything about that.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.466
- You don't know?

15:51.601 --> 15:53.267
- No.

15:53.403 --> 15:55.870
- Why don't you know?

15:56.006 --> 15:59.440
- Well, I tend to stay
out of politics.

15:59.576 --> 16:01.409
I just like
to run the house.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.611
- Bitch.

16:03.747 --> 16:05.680
- Excuse me?

16:05.815 --> 16:08.583
- You are just as ambitious
as I am.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.518
- [sighs] Ma'am...

16:10.654 --> 16:13.821
- Cut the shit.

16:13.957 --> 16:16.457
See, this is why I don't
like talking to you.

16:16.593 --> 16:20.628
You're so damn fake.

16:20.764 --> 16:24.899
What are you two up to?
Hmm?

16:25.035 --> 16:28.002
- I'm sorry.
I really don't know

16:28.138 --> 16:31.939
what you're talking about.
I don't.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.642
- Are you trying
to take over the White House?

16:34.778 --> 16:35.910
- No.
- The Oval?

16:36.046 --> 16:37.178
- [scoffs] Not at all.

16:37.313 --> 16:39.580
Now, why would we
wanna do that?

16:39.716 --> 16:44.352
You and your husband are doing
such an excellent job.

16:44.487 --> 16:48.923
- You think so?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Absolutely.

16:49.059 --> 16:51.993
- He hasn't done shit
since his first day.

16:52.128 --> 16:53.494
- Oh.

16:53.630 --> 16:56.964
- Donald and my father
have been running this country.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.334
- I didn't know
anything about that.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.804
- Yes, you did.

17:02.939 --> 17:06.274
- How would I know that?
Huh?

17:06.409 --> 17:10.078
- Okay, you know what?
I can't stand a fake-ass bitch.

17:10.213 --> 17:13.648
What's your plan, girl?
Tell me.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.417
- There is no plan.
I'm telling you,

17:16.553 --> 17:19.554
I know nothing about
what you're talking about.

17:19.689 --> 17:25.293
- You know nothing is the
operative word of that sentence.

17:27.163 --> 17:31.365
- Hmm. Well, I'm out of time.

17:31.501 --> 17:34.902
And I need to go meet
with my husband, so...

17:35.038 --> 17:37.572
- VICTORIA: Hmm.
So the First Lady

17:37.707 --> 17:43.544
invites you to lunch and you
have to meet with your husband?

17:43.680 --> 17:45.780
- Yes.

17:45.915 --> 17:48.015
- So rude.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.251
- Well, I'm sorry.

17:50.386 --> 17:54.856
- Why are you here?
What's your plan?

17:54.991 --> 17:58.693
- I keep telling you,
there is no plan.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.028
- I'm not -- with you!

18:01.164 --> 18:05.233
- [sighs] First Lady.

18:05.368 --> 18:08.035
- Second Lady.

18:10.540 --> 18:16.077
- Well, I swear to you

18:16.212 --> 18:18.579
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:18.715 --> 18:19.914
- Hmm.

18:20.049 --> 18:25.386
- Hmm?
So I hate to be rude,

18:25.522 --> 18:27.188
but I'm going to leave.

18:29.359 --> 18:32.126
- But you haven't
touched your entree, dear.

18:35.732 --> 18:37.965
- My apologies.

18:45.942 --> 18:47.642
- [door slamming]

18:47.777 --> 18:49.243
- Bitch.

18:52.849 --> 18:54.482

18:56.753 --> 18:59.387
- DALE: Hey.
- Hey, kids.

18:59.522 --> 19:02.089
You've been talking
in here for a while.

19:02.225 --> 19:06.828
- Yeah, yeah.
We were just talking.

19:06.963 --> 19:09.831
- Everything okay?

19:09.966 --> 19:11.199
- It will be.

19:11.334 --> 19:13.234
- Okay.
Well, uh, the store

19:13.369 --> 19:16.571
hasn't been open all day,
so I'm gonna go.

19:16.706 --> 19:17.939
But keep...

19:18.074 --> 19:20.441
- Uh, I will, yep,
I'll go with you.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.944
- Wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure?

19:23.079 --> 19:24.812
- Yeah.

19:24.948 --> 19:26.380
- Sharon?

19:26.516 --> 19:30.184
- No, I'm coming with you.
- Yeah, and I'll go, too.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.087
- You're coming?
- Yeah, we should all go.

19:33.223 --> 19:34.922
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

19:35.058 --> 19:37.692
Are you both sure about this?

19:37.827 --> 19:42.463
- Yeah.
- What am I missing?

19:42.599 --> 19:45.233
- Nothing.
Um, can you help me up?

19:45.368 --> 19:47.568
- Dale, if I have to help
you up, that's another reason

19:47.704 --> 19:49.871
why you should just be staying
right there in that bed.

19:50.006 --> 19:51.439
- I'm not staying here.

19:51.574 --> 19:53.941
- All right, listen.
We'll all go.

19:54.077 --> 19:56.510
Okay?

19:56.646 --> 19:58.012
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:58.147 --> 19:59.614
- But before we go,
does anybody wanna

19:59.749 --> 20:03.384
tell me what's going on?

20:03.519 --> 20:06.053
- Look, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

20:06.189 --> 20:08.723
Let's just go.

20:08.858 --> 20:10.591
- Okay. Let's go.
Easy.

20:16.165 --> 20:17.732
I'll wait for you outside.
- Okay.

20:17.867 --> 20:19.133
- Okay.

20:20.904 --> 20:24.038
- You got it?
- Yeah.

20:24.173 --> 20:25.406
- You can just
put your shoes

20:25.541 --> 20:27.108
on like that
and you got shot?

20:27.243 --> 20:29.477
- Yeah. [laughs]
- Well.

20:29.612 --> 20:32.914
- It's okay. Good.
- I guess you are a champion.

20:33.049 --> 20:36.017
- Non-lethal rounds.
- That's right. Yep.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.085
- Remember, yeah,
non-lethal rounds.

Will there be another guest?

be highly inappropriate.

a problem, ma'am?

22:30.383 --> 22:34.952

It's shocking.

Some grape soda.

a little bit like a Merlot.

You heard the First Lady.

A Merlot, please.

There's chicken,

That's what I'd do to you.

very different women.

Aren't we?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.238
We are nowhere near the same.

- Exactly.

- Yes.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.578

you know my father.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.953
- Sure you will.

24:16.088 --> 24:19.990

your ass wouldn't be here.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.592
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

24:21.727 --> 24:27.498

If you try one thing,

24:27.633 --> 24:29.600
your ass will be fired.

Of course.

Enjoy your lunch. [laughs]

- She wanted me to sit down.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.860
- What kind
of a sick game is this?

24:55.995 --> 24:57.895
- One that she
likes to play.

24:58.030 --> 25:02.800
- Priscilla.
- But I'm so much better at it.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.069
- I don't like this.

25:05.204 --> 25:08.038
- Well, she started it.

- Well.

to finish her?

- I would never.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.851
- Priscilla?

- I would never.

25:23.456 --> 25:25.990

25:26.125 --> 25:27.992
- Look at my face.

- Don't make me.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.503
- Don't make you do what?

25:39.639 --> 25:43.307
- I can have you removed.

25:43.442 --> 25:44.842
- You would do that
to me, Richard?

25:44.977 --> 25:49.380
- Yes. If it means saving
your life, I would.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.652

39:35.423 --> 39:37.523
- Son of a bitch.

39:37.659 --> 39:39.459
- Hello, everybody.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.995
I'd just like to say
that I'm proud to be honoring

39:42.130 --> 39:43.563
two American heroes.

39:43.698 --> 39:46.733
I have with me Max Carter
and Robert Cayden.

39:46.868 --> 39:49.636
We've been doing a full
investigation on what happened.

39:49.771 --> 39:53.940
These agents are not at fault.
They were investigating a crime.

39:54.075 --> 39:56.376
Agent Yuma did not
know the deceased.

40:00.482 --> 40:02.515
- Hunter.
- HUNTER: I know.

40:02.651 --> 40:04.484
- What the hell is going on?

40:04.619 --> 40:06.953
- ELI: From what we understand,
these agents were

40:07.088 --> 40:09.756
investigating her homicide
and uncovered evidence

40:09.891 --> 40:12.959
which links the White House
to these crimes.

40:13.094 --> 40:14.627
- MAN: Are you saying
you think someone

40:14.763 --> 40:16.829
is connected in the White House
to these deaths?

40:16.965 --> 40:19.432
- Yes.
- MAN: Well, who could that be?

40:19.567 --> 40:21.067
- I have a clear view
at this time.

40:21.202 --> 40:26.639
And we believe it to be
the President and First Lady.

40:26.775 --> 40:29.008
Now, we are as eager
to get to the bottom of this

40:29.144 --> 40:32.578
as are the FBI and DOJ.
- What the --?

40:32.714 --> 40:35.381
- ELI: But I'd like to reiterate
that Agents Yuma,

40:35.517 --> 40:37.617
Carter, and Cayden
are not suspects,

40:37.752 --> 40:39.452
we are happy to report.

40:39.587 --> 40:41.254
They are heroic agents.

40:41.389 --> 40:43.790
Max should be given the
Presidential Medal of Freedom

40:43.925 --> 40:45.491
for the way he's
served his country,

40:45.627 --> 40:48.061
as should former agent Cayden.

40:48.196 --> 40:52.065
They are pariots and they
should be celebrated as such.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.600
- MAN: How far do you think
the President's involvement is?

40:54.736 --> 40:56.769
- All the way.
And we are committed

40:56.905 --> 40:58.771
to making sure
that the individuals responsible

40:58.907 --> 41:01.974
for these heinous deaths
are brought to justice.

41:02.110 --> 41:03.876
- That son of a bitch.

41:04.012 --> 41:06.212
- MAN: You said deaths.
There's more than one?

41:06.347 --> 41:08.715
- At this time, we know of two.
And as a result,

41:08.850 --> 41:10.917
my office is invoking
the 25th Amendment to remove

41:11.052 --> 41:16.489
the President immediately.
- [audience chattering]

41:19.327 --> 41:22.395
- Okay.
I'm done.

41:25.266 --> 41:27.767
You dropped something.

41:31.039 --> 41:32.171
- ANNOUNCER:
Next on "The Oval"...

41:32.307 --> 41:33.873
- Don't go.
- Kyle, shut the hell up.

41:34.008 --> 41:35.842
- You mother --!
- SAM: Shut the hell up!

41:35.977 --> 41:38.444
- To the Oval, now.

41:40.115 --> 41:41.380
- We have all the proof
that we need.

41:41.516 --> 41:44.884
- And what proof is that?
These two?

41:45.019 --> 41:48.621
- She is a horrible human.
- Is she?

41:48.757 --> 41:50.590
- PRISCILLA: And how bad she
treats her children?

41:50.725 --> 41:53.059
- I'd need to see the wizard
to be able to cry

41:53.194 --> 41:56.662
for this mother --. [laughs]

41:56.798 --> 41:58.297
[gasping] I can't breathe.
