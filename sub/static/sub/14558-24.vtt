WEBVTT

00:10.778 --> 00:13.314
* One... take control of me?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.083
* You're messin' with
the enemy *

00:15.116 --> 00:17.818
* Said it's two,
it's another trick *

00:17.851 --> 00:19.687
* Messin' with my mind,
I wake up *

00:19.720 --> 00:22.323
* Chase down an empty street

00:22.356 --> 00:24.492
* Blindly snap
the broken beats *

00:24.525 --> 00:26.694
* Said it's gone
with the dirty trick... *

00:26.727 --> 00:29.430
Only when you are already late.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.368
* I tell you I want you

00:36.370 --> 00:38.439
* I tell you I need you

00:38.472 --> 00:40.508
* Friends, take control of me

00:40.541 --> 00:42.776
* Stalking cross
the gallery... *

00:42.810 --> 00:44.345
(remote beeps,
explosion thunders)

00:51.785 --> 00:53.787
That was just to show you
that I could.

00:53.821 --> 00:54.888
Hey, put that down!

00:54.922 --> 00:58.159
I'm a speed dial away.
from collapsing this bridge.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.727
Hey... what's it going to take

00:59.760 --> 01:00.794
for that not to happen?

01:00.828 --> 01:03.197
* I tell you I want you

01:05.833 --> 01:07.701
* I tell you I need you

01:10.138 --> 01:12.840
* I tell you I want you....

01:14.275 --> 01:16.144
Hey.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.578
So what's up?
He asked for me?

01:17.611 --> 01:18.646
You and Charlie.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.713
No coincidence
I was driving across

01:19.747 --> 01:21.182
that bridge today.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.517
CHARLIE: Hey, Don.
What's going on?

01:23.551 --> 01:24.585
I don't know,
you got me.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.519
But we're going
to find out.

01:26.387 --> 01:29.423
(phone ringing)

01:29.457 --> 01:30.358
This is Agent
Don Eppes.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.760
What was your junior year
batting average?

01:32.793 --> 01:35.729
What was my junior
year batting average?

01:35.763 --> 01:37.431
.293.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.832
That would be your brother.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.135
I'd really like to meet him.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.270
All right, well,

01:42.303 --> 01:43.337
we can work
that out.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.405
Why don't you
just come on in?

01:44.438 --> 01:47.708
Professor Eppes is out here
in seven minutes...

01:47.741 --> 01:48.876
or the next bomb goes off.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.145
What?

01:51.179 --> 01:52.813
What do we got?
We have C4

01:52.846 --> 01:54.282
with cell phone
detonators--

01:54.315 --> 01:56.217
I saw the same setup
in Tel Aviv.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.017
His placement

01:57.050 --> 01:59.187
indicates a solid
understanding

01:59.220 --> 01:59.987
of structural mechanics.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.422
- See those metal ribs?
- Uh-huh.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.656
They support
the arch--

02:02.690 --> 02:04.358
if he takes out
enough of them,

02:04.392 --> 02:05.459
the arch is going
to collapse,

02:05.493 --> 02:06.727
and it's gonna bring the entire
bridge down with it.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.929
DAVID: And our jammer doesn't
have the range, but if we knew

02:08.962 --> 02:10.398
what service he was on,
we'd be able

02:10.431 --> 02:11.632
to shut down
a whole grid of towers.

02:11.665 --> 02:12.700
COLBY:
And the only way

02:12.733 --> 02:13.501
to figure that out
would be to get a closer look

02:13.534 --> 02:15.536
at the cell phones
on the bombs.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.904
David, you want to take
a little climb?

02:16.937 --> 02:19.407
Yeah, bridge didn't kill me
once today--

02:19.440 --> 02:20.574
might as well give it

02:20.608 --> 02:22.410
- another shot.
- DON: Careful there, huh?

02:22.443 --> 02:25.646
So... you know I'm always happy
to help you, right?

02:25.679 --> 02:28.316
What, a face-to-face with
this guy cross the line?

02:28.349 --> 02:29.850
Frankly, yeah.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.548
(treads clattering)

03:04.952 --> 03:06.420
K Level thinking... good.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.855
You might keep up.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.857
Just try to find
out what he wants.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.559
Ask him why he asked
for you and me.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.828
Sorry, sir,
you have us at a loss.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.929
Have I met you before?

03:15.963 --> 03:16.864
No.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.933
But I'm an ardent admirer
of your work--

03:19.967 --> 03:20.868
the Eppes Convergence.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.237
"The more you read and learn,

03:23.271 --> 03:25.606
the less your adversary
will know."

03:25.639 --> 03:26.974
- I'm sorry?
- Ah, that's...

03:27.007 --> 03:28.842
that's The Art of War.
That's Sun Tzu.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.912
Very good.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.848
Each time you answer a question
correctly,

03:34.882 --> 03:37.518
I'll throw away a phone.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.520
Each time you're wrong,
I'll detonate a bomb.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.356
How many questions do you
suppose you can afford

03:42.390 --> 03:43.357
to get wrong?

03:43.391 --> 03:45.359
Uh, before the bridge collapses?

03:45.393 --> 03:46.460
Six.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.029
They will get harder.

03:49.062 --> 03:49.963
(coughs)

03:53.967 --> 03:55.936
In 1972,

03:55.969 --> 03:57.871
when the
Merkle-Hellman

03:57.905 --> 03:59.440
knapsack algorithm
was published--

03:59.473 --> 04:00.841
1978.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.611
Francis Bacon posited

04:03.644 --> 04:06.314
four obstructions
to the scientific method.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.615
The Idols of the Mind:

04:07.648 --> 04:09.283
The cave...

04:09.317 --> 04:10.651
The theatre...

04:10.684 --> 04:12.453
The tribe...

04:12.486 --> 04:15.623
The... um...

04:16.590 --> 04:17.391
(speed-dial beeping)

04:23.431 --> 04:25.399
...the marketplace, damn it!

04:25.433 --> 04:26.567
You didn't give me enough time!

04:26.600 --> 04:28.402
I'm not just testing
your mind,

04:28.436 --> 04:30.070
I'm testing your heart.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.707
I'm going to give over
my life's work to you people.

04:33.741 --> 04:34.975
What work? What are we
talking about here?

04:35.008 --> 04:36.977
When the inventor
of the chessboard

04:37.010 --> 04:39.046
sold his creation to a king,

04:39.079 --> 04:43.417
he asked for a single grain
of wheat for the first square,

04:43.451 --> 04:45.986
two for the second,
four for the third,

04:46.019 --> 04:47.788
doubling the amount each time--

04:47.821 --> 04:50.658
How many grains of wheat
was the inventor asking for?

04:52.059 --> 04:53.894
It's the wheat and
chessboard problem--

04:53.927 --> 04:54.928
It's two to the 64th, minus one.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.598
It's...
too easy a question.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.737
He's on VeraCell.

05:03.771 --> 05:04.972
TECH:
I need every VeraCell tower

05:05.005 --> 05:07.040
on a grid
within five miles

05:07.074 --> 05:08.942
of the Sixth Street bridge
shut down now.

05:08.976 --> 05:13.046
I would give you more time,
if I had it, Professor.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.616
(coughing):
Everyone deserves more time.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.884
CHARLIE:
All right, I mean...

05:16.917 --> 05:18.419
I can't be totally sure
about this.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.821
Well, it's all
we got-- do it.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.556
18 quintillion...

05:22.590 --> 05:24.958
446 quadrillion...

05:24.992 --> 05:27.628
744 trillion...

05:27.661 --> 05:29.530
73 billion...

05:29.563 --> 05:31.899
799 million...

05:31.932 --> 05:34.034
551,000...

05:34.067 --> 05:36.670
six hundred and fifteen.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.739
No.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.940
That's not right.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.141
Yes, it is.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.443
Aw, come on.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.980
Why don't you tell me
what the answer is.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.883
I've given you everything
you need.

05:51.051 --> 05:54.154
(speed-dial beeps,
then alarm beeps)

05:54.187 --> 05:56.156
VeraCell cell grid is down.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.057
Towers are down.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.027
Come on, let's go!

06:00.060 --> 06:01.995
DON:
Get down on your knees!

06:02.029 --> 06:03.731
It's over!
Get down on your knees!

06:03.764 --> 06:05.933
Get down!

06:05.966 --> 06:08.368
If you find the Janus List,
trust it!

06:09.102 --> 06:10.404
Get down!

06:22.049 --> 06:23.617
Hey.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.553
What do you got
there, a smoothie?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.588
- Pepto Bismol.
- Oh, yeah.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.590
Oh, buddy, come on, you got
to give yourself a break.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.559
Look, you did the best
you could, all right?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.794
I was right about the wheat
and chessboard problem.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.863
Your bomber's got
third-degree burns,

06:35.896 --> 06:38.866
shotgun wounds to
the lungs, stomach--

06:38.899 --> 06:41.134
ICU says it's a matter
of when, not if.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.636
When'd you get back?

06:42.670 --> 06:44.505
Just this morning.
Nice to see you.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.174
You know about Larry,
that he's...?

06:47.207 --> 06:48.408
In a monastery.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.512
I got a note underneath my door
in really nice calligraphy.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.581
How'd your assignment go?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.519
Or maybe I'm not
supposed to know.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.655
The prints I.D.'d your guy
as Taylor Ashby.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.457
He has dual citizenship between

07:03.491 --> 07:05.659
us and the Brits, and he worked
for a company called Blackrain.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.596
It's like a Halliburton of
international intelligence.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.664
Like, what
kind of stuff?

07:10.698 --> 07:12.065
Our CIA asked
their director

07:12.099 --> 07:14.134
for a first look
at whatever they find.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.203
You know, he said
a lot of cryptic things

07:16.236 --> 07:17.605
about his life's work.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.240
He was testing us--
K level thinking.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.609
MEGAN:
He's a narcissist.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.877
Goes along with
a sociopathic personality.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.145
Guy organized this whole thing

07:25.178 --> 07:26.947
as just like
an elaborate suicide note.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.583
DON: Yeah, but I mean, this
isn't some freak with a grenade.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.219
This guy went to a lot of
trouble, makes no demands.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.454
He did make one demand.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.492
To talk with us.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.631
(British accent):
There are over a thousand

07:43.664 --> 07:46.033
foreign operatives
on your soil.

07:46.066 --> 07:49.670
Since 9/11, with your resources
diverted to fighting terrorism,

07:49.703 --> 07:52.673
much of the monitoring
has been outsourced.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.544
I don't know whether

07:56.577 --> 07:59.613
spy craft attracts disturbed
personalities or makes us.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.682
Ashby was a spy?

08:01.715 --> 08:04.251
Well, that's stretching things.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.054
In his heyday, he was
a fairly skilled cryptographer.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.255
I hired him
after MI-6

08:08.288 --> 08:09.623
made him redundant.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.825
British Intelligence fired him?

08:11.859 --> 08:12.926
Cryptography has become
the province

08:12.960 --> 08:15.729
of 25-year-old
mathematics prodigies.

08:15.763 --> 08:16.764
Poor old Ashby

08:16.797 --> 08:17.865
couldn't make the transition

08:17.898 --> 08:19.567
from invisible ink
and microfilm.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.034
Then what'd
he do for you?

08:21.068 --> 08:22.603
Data analysis.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.106
Tell the truth, though, I, uh...

08:26.139 --> 08:28.576
I think I hired him
because I felt sorry for him.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.877
30 years

08:29.910 --> 08:32.580
serving his country,
he deserved better

08:32.613 --> 08:34.848
than a cold water flat
in the East End.

08:34.882 --> 08:38.686
He screamed something
about a Janus List.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.620
(groans)

08:39.653 --> 08:43.824
It's an old spy fiction.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.761
A master list of double agents
and traitors.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.329
Janus, the two-faced Roman god.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.931
But how do you know
it's a fiction?

08:54.635 --> 08:55.535
You know what they give you

08:55.569 --> 08:57.304
when you get killed
in our line of duty?

08:57.337 --> 08:59.740
An anonymous star

08:59.773 --> 09:01.008
on a blank wall.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.645
Taylor Ashby was
an old, lonely man.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.615
My guess is that what
he couldn't achieve in life,

09:07.648 --> 09:10.017
he could pretend
to have in death.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.123
ASHBY: Each time you answer a
question correctly,

09:16.156 --> 09:18.692
I'll throw away a phone.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.929
Each time you're wrong,
I'll detonate a bomb.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.197
You're not supposed to be
looking at that.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.767
You're not supposed to
leave it lying around.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.869
Oxford.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.904
First class honors
in English Lit,

09:30.938 --> 09:33.641
dissertation on Shakespeare.

09:33.674 --> 09:37.177
No, he chose us for a...

09:37.210 --> 09:38.846
he chose me for a reason.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.114
You know, nothing he did
seemed rash

09:41.148 --> 09:44.151
or... or unpremeditated.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.687
Francis Bacon posited four...

09:46.720 --> 09:48.822
You know, a lot of people think

09:48.856 --> 09:51.859
that Francis Bacon was
the real Shakespeare.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.927
That he hid codes
in the prose of his plays

09:53.961 --> 09:56.129
that reveal him to be
the true author of the works.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.699
Supposedly, there was
even an inscription

09:58.732 --> 10:01.702
on a bust of Shakespeare that
used a code of letter-shapes.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.170
Right, the Bacon Ci...

10:03.203 --> 10:05.072
the Bacon Cipher.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.649
In their prime-- Ruth or Bonds?

10:15.683 --> 10:18.285
Uh... Williams.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.720
He was a war hero,

10:19.753 --> 10:21.689
played the game clean,
and no juice.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.124
Fire alarm's crooked.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.760
Yeah, I'd have taken Ruth.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.195
'Cause he hit
all those home runs,

10:28.228 --> 10:29.763
and he was drunk.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.031
(chuckles)

10:35.736 --> 10:36.937
I got a bug here.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.772
Really?

10:38.806 --> 10:40.874
Looks like one of ours.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.876
Yeah?

10:44.011 --> 10:46.279
This one doesn't.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.750
DAVID:
Six electronic

10:49.783 --> 10:52.019
listening devices; our techs
have already I.D.'d

10:52.052 --> 10:52.853
four of them.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.388
We got French,
Israeli, Russian...

10:55.422 --> 10:56.890
and our very own NSA.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.391
COLBY: And Ashby had to have
known about it, too.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.260
I mean, there's no way
surveillance pros

11:00.293 --> 11:02.162
would've scratched
the switch plate

11:02.195 --> 11:03.931
or left the fire alarm
hanging loose.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.166
So he knows who's listening
and he knows how.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.235
Obviously, he's controlling
what they hear.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.303
MEGAN: Hey, Ashby was discharged
from MI-6

11:10.337 --> 11:12.072
with a psychopathic
personality disorder.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.274
Which is right in line
with what McClair said,

11:14.307 --> 11:15.909
and the behavior
out on the bridge.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.344
Yeah, but he also said
he's a nobody,

11:17.377 --> 11:18.879
and we got half the world

11:18.912 --> 11:20.047
bugging his apartment.
What'd the NSA say?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.715
DAVID:
Same thing they always do.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.851
They're gonna get back to us.

11:23.884 --> 11:24.818
Well, get back to
them; see if they

11:24.852 --> 11:27.220
know anything
about that, uh, Janus List.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.756
MEGAN:
I-I see there's some

11:28.789 --> 11:30.190
unanswered questions here,
but I don't really think

11:30.223 --> 11:31.925
there's a crime to be solved.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.761
Well, that's my decision, right?

11:35.763 --> 11:36.897
(chuckles)

11:36.930 --> 11:37.664
Miss this?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.767
(laughs):
More than you know.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.036
And for the record,

11:43.070 --> 11:44.772
what exactly were
you guys thinking,

11:44.805 --> 11:46.874
climbing out on the bridge
before the bomb squad?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.142
(chuckles):
That was his big idea.

12:00.821 --> 12:04.758
I'm not sure you can
hear me, but...

12:04.792 --> 12:06.827
that question
you asked me...

12:09.429 --> 12:11.999
I know that you know
that I was correct.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.770
You were trying
to tell me something--

12:16.804 --> 12:18.906
Bacon, Merkle-Hellman...

12:18.939 --> 12:21.208
You were talking
about code.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.210
You were talking in code.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.878
(monitor beeping)

12:26.379 --> 12:28.348
(beeping accelerates)

12:28.381 --> 12:30.450
WOMAN (on intercom):
Dr. Andrew to ICU-- stat.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.551
Dr. Andrew to ICU-- stat.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.220
What's the FiO2
on the ventilator?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.222
WOMAN:
Normal-- 50%.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.990
DOCTOR:
Lungs are clear.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.927
This makes no sense; we've got
to be looking at artifacting.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.196
Order a chest X-ray; I don't
want to take any chances.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.065
(monitor beeping)

12:51.872 --> 12:53.173
I need a pen.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.808
Uh, who has a pen?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.109
WOMAN:
Here you go.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.961
Hey.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.929
- Hey.
- How's it going?

13:15.963 --> 13:17.130
Charlie, are you
kidding me?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.531
They're gonna
charge us for this.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.401
Yeah, but listen, so see how the
oxygen saturation flash

13:21.434 --> 13:23.904
keeps cycling through the same
sequence of numbers?

13:23.937 --> 13:27.007
His finger is tapping out
those numbers.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.309
Merkle-Hellman
is based in cryptography.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.978
Francis Bacon,
Bacon's Cipher...

13:31.011 --> 13:32.846
Wait, wait, he was a
cryptologist for the Brits.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.015
I mean, that would be
unbelievable

13:35.048 --> 13:36.483
if this guy actually could

13:36.516 --> 13:40.020
talk to you,
communicate through all this.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.588
But there are
a million codes, man.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.424
I don't know how I'm going to
figure out which one he chose.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.426
What about that one
you got wrong, the chess one?

13:46.459 --> 13:48.428
I didn't get it wrong,
I got it right. What about it?

13:48.461 --> 13:49.963
Every code has a key,

13:49.997 --> 13:51.899
so maybe there was some
reason that he was lying.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.035
You know, the Russians

13:55.068 --> 13:57.604
used something called...

13:57.637 --> 13:59.106
Don't start
writing on the...

13:59.139 --> 14:01.441
...a Straddling
Checkerboard.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.944
It's a pretty simple
substitution code

14:03.977 --> 14:07.915
where the letters of a message
are replaced with digits.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.051
You start with the highest
frequency letters first.

14:11.084 --> 14:14.354
Zero, one, two, three,
four, five...

14:14.387 --> 14:16.957
...Z-K...

14:16.990 --> 14:19.492
...Y-D-H...

14:19.526 --> 14:23.997
J-A-N...

14:24.031 --> 14:25.432
U-S...

14:37.544 --> 14:39.046
"Janus poisoned me."

14:49.489 --> 14:52.092
MEGAN: Ashby had traces of
Thallium in his bloodstream.

14:52.125 --> 14:55.062
Thallium is what Saddam
used against dissidents.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.164
They'd have a final drink with
their guard

14:57.197 --> 14:57.965
as they were released,

14:57.998 --> 14:59.366
and seven days
later, lights out.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.935
So wait, you're saying he knew
he was dying

15:01.969 --> 15:02.802
before he got on the bridge?

15:02.835 --> 15:04.337
So we got a homicide,
not a suicide.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.106
Thanks for not saying
"I told you so."

15:06.139 --> 15:07.674
Well, you didn't
give me a chance.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.610
Well, I don't understand, why do
you think he didn't call us

15:10.643 --> 15:12.679
or try to talk then?

15:12.712 --> 15:14.581
Well, he knew his apartment was
bugged,

15:14.614 --> 15:15.415
he knew he'd been poisoned.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.649
Compounded with delusions of
grandeur

15:16.683 --> 15:18.518
and a paranoid nature...

15:18.551 --> 15:21.621
Maybe he thought it was the only
way we'd take him seriously,

15:21.654 --> 15:22.055
I guess, right?

15:22.089 --> 15:22.855
Um, it's work.

15:22.889 --> 15:23.323
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.058
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:25.092 --> 15:25.925
According to the NSA,

15:25.959 --> 15:28.095
your guy over
at Blackrain is right.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.197
This "Janus List"--
thing doesn't exist.

15:30.230 --> 15:34.067
But McClair, he undersold
Ashby's history.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.069
Turns out this guy
is a Cold War legend.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.171
COLBY:
Double and triple agent.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.639
By the time MI-6 cut him loose,

15:39.672 --> 15:41.574
nobody knew which side
he was playing for.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.709
Yeah, and those wire taps?

15:42.742 --> 15:44.277
They turned them
over after we threatened

15:44.311 --> 15:46.413
to sell their bug
to the Russians.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.747
But look what we turned up.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.116
ASHBY:
This line isn't clean.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.383
MAN:
By the time anyone reads

15:50.417 --> 15:51.718
this transcript, I'm in Beijing.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.186
I want money.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.454
Dwayne Carter.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.989
That conversation
happened two hours

15:56.023 --> 15:57.757
before we busted him trying
to leave the country.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.891
Last time I heard,

15:58.925 --> 16:01.628
they were keeping him at
an army base for safekeeping.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.396
- So I can track him down.
- Not alone.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.766
Are you kidding me?
You still don't trust me?

16:06.799 --> 16:07.734
You covered for the guy.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.502
Don, as soon as I found out
he was working

16:09.536 --> 16:11.071
for the Chinese,
I took him down.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.339
Whatever happened,

16:12.372 --> 16:14.741
I've logged some serious time
with this guy in Afghanistan.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.376
If he's going
to open up to anybody,

16:16.409 --> 16:18.011
- it's going to be to me.
- You go with him.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.118
DAVID:
Taylor Ashby.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.320
I heard he's dying.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.056
How'd you hear that?

16:29.089 --> 16:31.024
(laughs)

16:31.058 --> 16:33.160
When you tried to get
to China, Dwayne,

16:33.193 --> 16:35.162
you called him,
asked for money.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.730
Ashby tried to deal himself
back into the big game.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.299
Use his position
at Blackrain

16:39.332 --> 16:41.468
to become an information
clearinghouse.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.071
Any time I came across something
the Chinese wouldn't miss,

16:44.104 --> 16:45.205
I'd sell it off to him.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.373
Names,

16:46.406 --> 16:48.808
intercepts... junk, usually.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.377
What did he do with it?

16:50.410 --> 16:51.578
I didn't ask.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.180
I gave him intel,

16:53.213 --> 16:56.083
he gave me brown paper
bags full of cash.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.717
He ever tell you about something
called the Janus List?

17:00.653 --> 17:04.124
In the spook business, we call
what I gave you "the sample."

17:04.157 --> 17:07.560
You want the rest, you got to
pay for it like everybody else.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.163
Talk to my lawyers.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.199
You're on your last appeal,
Dwayne.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.300
If you don't want to cooperate,

17:13.333 --> 17:15.302
you might as well place an order
for your last meal.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.138
That easy, is it, Granger?

17:18.171 --> 17:20.107
A man who
saves your life,

17:20.140 --> 17:22.742
you put him in jail, walk away?

17:22.775 --> 17:24.411
You think this guy
is your friend,

17:24.444 --> 17:26.113
- you can think again.
- That's enough.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.680
'Cause the things
I could tell you

17:27.714 --> 17:29.849
about squeaky clean
Colby Granger--

17:29.882 --> 17:31.451
things we saw,
things we did...

17:31.484 --> 17:33.120
Screw you, Dwayne.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.020
You can walk away, Granger,

17:34.053 --> 17:35.655
but we're not done
with each other yet.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.557
He's wasting our time,
David, let's go.

17:37.590 --> 17:37.924
I saved your life!

17:37.957 --> 17:39.426
I own it!

17:42.862 --> 17:44.831
DON:
I face off

17:44.864 --> 17:47.134
against so many
guys, Charlie.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.136
I don't know what it is,
something about this guy,

17:49.169 --> 17:50.203
some look in his eyes.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.638
A remarkable mind...

17:51.671 --> 17:55.408
accounting for David's
travel path, constructing a code

17:55.442 --> 17:57.444
- to tell us he was poisoned.
- Amazing.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.279
While he's dying, you know?

17:59.312 --> 18:01.714
I think he did it
to tell us something

18:01.748 --> 18:04.251
that we wouldn't have
believed any other way.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.485
Yeah, so what is it?

18:05.518 --> 18:07.120
They all say that Janus List
doesn't exist.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.422
You know what I'm
wondering is why us?

18:09.456 --> 18:11.158
He knew everything
about us:

18:11.191 --> 18:12.259
the Eppes Convergence,

18:12.292 --> 18:14.627
- your batting average.
- So what...

18:14.661 --> 18:15.862
- Hey, Amita.
- Hi.

18:15.895 --> 18:16.863
How're you doing?

18:16.896 --> 18:18.030
All of the books you asked for.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.200
Plus another two on Francis
Bacon that I really like.

18:23.336 --> 18:26.306
Merkle-Hellman's
knapsack algorithm...

18:26.339 --> 18:28.175
You know, I wondered about that.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.476
I mean, if Ashby
was a cryptographer,

18:29.509 --> 18:30.777
wouldn't he have known
that Merkle-Hellman's

18:30.810 --> 18:32.412
encryption has been broken?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.181
He wanted us to break it.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.616
Don, think of everything
that happened on that bridge.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.819
Everything he did
and everything he said

18:39.852 --> 18:42.722
as things you would pack
with you on a trip,

18:42.755 --> 18:46.493
but you have a single knapsack
that can hold only 30 pounds.

18:46.526 --> 18:49.262
Each item has a value
and a weight to it.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.432
Your challenge is
to take the greatest value

18:52.465 --> 18:53.600
within the specified weight.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.268
In combinatorics,

18:55.302 --> 18:57.204
we call it
a "knapsack algorithm."

18:57.237 --> 18:59.272
So what if every number
he gave us,

18:59.306 --> 19:02.342
every question he asked...

19:02.375 --> 19:04.344
had a specific function?

19:04.377 --> 19:06.246
A specific value?

19:06.279 --> 19:07.347
Like my batting average.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.350
Right, which was, uh, .293.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.451
Then he asked us

19:11.484 --> 19:13.686
how many bombs it would take
to take down the bridge,

19:13.720 --> 19:14.887
and that was six.

19:14.921 --> 19:18.491
- Uh-huh.
- Merkle-Hellman was 1978,

19:18.525 --> 19:20.860
- but he said '72.
- '72.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.262
64 chess squares.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.163
And the answer to the problem.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.339
(mouthing)

19:32.372 --> 19:33.640
DON:
All right, so?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.975
The Straddling
Checkerboard code.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.545
Man, he thought he was
going to die on that bridge.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.779
He had no idea

19:39.812 --> 19:41.414
he would use it
in the hospital,

19:41.448 --> 19:42.949
so what if...?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.329
Wait, check this out.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.504
NaomiVaughn@laledger.org.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.007
NAOMI: Five times a week
somebody calls me

20:08.040 --> 20:10.277
and tells me they
have my Pulitzer story.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.778
Taylor was number six.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.913
And what was
he offering?

20:13.946 --> 20:16.349
An expose on international
intelligence.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.818
He felt that so much work
was being outsourced

20:18.851 --> 20:21.288
that these multinational
companies were spying

20:21.321 --> 20:24.257
on two and three competing
sides at the same time.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.926
Like Blackrain
International.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.296
He said he had
a list of spies.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.330
The Janus List?

20:30.363 --> 20:31.598
Yeah.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.765
Ms. Vaughn,

20:32.799 --> 20:34.867
I'm gonna ask you if
I can see your notes

20:34.901 --> 20:36.636
and correspondence,
whatever you have.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.871
Ask or tell?

20:38.905 --> 20:40.273
Whatever makes
you feel better

20:40.307 --> 20:42.609
about handing them over.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.651
What you got there, Donny?

20:51.684 --> 20:53.653
Oh, it's an
MI-6 file.

20:53.686 --> 20:54.987
It's like a book.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.055
It's amazing.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.691
This guy Ashby crossed the
Berlin Wall four times.

20:58.725 --> 21:02.762
He was interrogated
by the GRU, KGB...

21:02.795 --> 21:05.298
That's something, huh?

21:07.066 --> 21:10.570
Guy like this risks his life
for 30 years,

21:10.603 --> 21:13.406
and nobody cares, you know?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.942
Nobody's going
to read this stuff.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.010
This really you?

21:19.412 --> 21:20.780
Don Eppes empathizing
with a lunatic

21:20.813 --> 21:22.415
who tried to blow up a bridge?

21:22.449 --> 21:26.586
I can understand how
you wonder, is it

21:26.619 --> 21:28.355
worth it?

21:28.388 --> 21:30.357
Do any of us make a difference?

21:30.390 --> 21:32.325
Yeah.

21:32.359 --> 21:33.760
Gets harder as you get older.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.563
(phone ringing)

21:36.596 --> 21:37.997
(sighs)

21:38.030 --> 21:39.432
Hey, where are you at?

21:39.466 --> 21:40.299
CHARLIE:
Still at the hospital.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.335
There's just some work
on the window

21:42.369 --> 21:45.438
I need to copy down
before they clean it, so, uh...

21:45.472 --> 21:47.340
Uh, where'd
the security guard go?

21:47.374 --> 21:48.941
Fight broke
out in the E.R.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.009
What are you talking about?

21:50.042 --> 21:52.445
Uh, the security guard
posted with Ashby is gone.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.846
I guess there was a fight
downstairs?

21:53.880 --> 21:55.014
Wait. He left his post?

21:55.047 --> 21:56.749
Charlie, you get security
in there

21:56.783 --> 21:58.385
right away, okay?
I'm on my way.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.619
Okay, all right.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.522
Um... how do I get
a dial tone?

22:02.555 --> 22:03.890
There's no dial tone?

22:09.662 --> 22:12.098
Uh, hey, listen,

22:12.131 --> 22:14.100
Lois, we need
to get this patient

22:14.133 --> 22:15.134
out of here
right now.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.168
That's impossible.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.303
Someone has already tried
to poison this man,

22:17.336 --> 22:20.006
and they may very well be coming
to kill him right now.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.941
So I am an FBI...

22:21.974 --> 22:24.377
You know, I work for the FBI.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.479
Can't you protect him?

22:26.513 --> 22:29.081
Well, uh, actually,
I'm a mathematician.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.488
No one uses
these tunnels anymore.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.390
They were built
as bomb shelters

22:37.424 --> 22:39.626
during World War II, but with
the earthquakes around here,

22:39.659 --> 22:41.628
you're better off taking
your chances above ground.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.863
Few people realize that most
deaths from an earthquake

22:43.896 --> 22:47.400
occur afterwards from fire,
ruptured gas lines.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.367
Sorry. Nervous energy.

23:13.626 --> 23:14.794
No signal.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.729
Hey, in here.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.502
(latch clicks)

23:36.716 --> 23:37.984
(beeping)

23:38.017 --> 23:39.952
Are you familiar
with Lorentz's Force Law?

23:39.986 --> 23:42.789
(beep, buzzing)

23:42.822 --> 23:45.625
Guess not.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.026
5:00 Coffee Barn in Westwood?

23:47.059 --> 23:48.961
No, that won't be a problem.

23:50.697 --> 23:53.800
On second thought, we might need
to put that on hold.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.668
Let me get
back to you.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.804
Someone just tried
to kill Taylor Ashby.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.540
Hey, look, I gave you guys

24:00.573 --> 24:02.809
everything I had-- all
my notes, my e-mails.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.844
If we could find you,
whoever came after Ashby

24:04.877 --> 24:05.745
might be able to, as well.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.714
We think it would be best
if you were

24:07.747 --> 24:09.749
under protective custody
at this point in time, ma'am.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.785
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.923
Charlie?

24:16.956 --> 24:17.824
Hey.

24:17.857 --> 24:18.691
How are you?

24:18.725 --> 24:20.993
Dad, I risked my life
for a dying man.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.228
I mean, that's not me.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.229
I acted recklessly

24:23.262 --> 24:26.098
against my own instinct
for self-preservation.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.767
And yet, in a weird way,

24:27.800 --> 24:29.736
I have never felt more...

24:29.769 --> 24:31.738
empowered.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.706
You sound like Don.

24:33.740 --> 24:34.907
You know, a mind
this brilliant deserves

24:34.941 --> 24:36.743
to know that it didn't die
in vain.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.878
That it didn't
live in vain.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.479
AMITA:
Charlie!

24:41.714 --> 24:43.550
I'm fine.
(gasps)

24:43.583 --> 24:44.751
- I'm fine.
- Oh.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.758
Chopper's not coming.

24:51.791 --> 24:52.925
Really?

24:52.959 --> 24:54.794
Why not? Because we just
arrested

24:54.827 --> 24:56.763
the guy you paid
to kill Ashby.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.798
Yeah, that'd be two days
before the Thallium

24:58.831 --> 25:00.733
and the burns
would have done him in.

25:00.767 --> 25:03.836
I kept that old man
on the payroll for ten years,

25:03.870 --> 25:06.172
and he repaid me
by compiling a Janus List.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.743
Look, it's nothing personal.

25:10.777 --> 25:11.911
You almost got

25:11.944 --> 25:14.614
my brother killed with all
your cloak and dagger crap.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.816
Well, we had no reason
to think he'd still be there.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.852
This is bigger
than him.

25:19.886 --> 25:20.953
It's bigger than all of us.

25:20.987 --> 25:24.223
A Janus List is not some
random collection of spies.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.193
It's a carefully selected
group of pressure points

25:27.226 --> 25:28.995
designed to cripple
intelligence operations.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.863
Why is it no one thinks
the list even exists?

25:30.897 --> 25:32.832
Who's going to take that risk?

25:32.865 --> 25:33.800
I'm not.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.234
Your government isn't.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.770
Why am I not
wearing handcuffs?

25:37.804 --> 25:41.040
Because the State Department
has already told you not

25:41.073 --> 25:42.775
to arrest me.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.246
And, uh, just for the record,
I didn't poison Ashby.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.848
But if he
had compiled

25:48.881 --> 25:51.784
a Janus List, and if he talked
to a reporter about it,

25:51.818 --> 25:54.086
then we're all better off
when he can't talk anymore.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.788
We're not done, you and I.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.790
Really?

25:57.824 --> 26:01.661
You can't even stop a helicopter
from landing in your own city.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.806
Uh, looks quiet.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.842
There's no cars
unaccounted for.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.109
Nobody on
the beach.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.145
Hey, we're really sorry
about the inconvenience.

26:19.178 --> 26:21.981
We wouldn't have done this
if we didn't think

26:22.014 --> 26:22.782
it was absolutely
necessary.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.016
I don't understand
what's going on.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.886
You grab me off the street,
you take away my cell phone...

26:26.919 --> 26:27.820
COLBY: Well, that's for your
safety.

26:27.854 --> 26:30.022
Somebody could zero in
on your GPS chip.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.858
Well, so far, the only people

26:31.891 --> 26:33.626
threatening my well-being
are you people.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.294
Perhaps you don't
respect the rights

26:35.327 --> 26:38.197
that the Constitution
extends to reporters

26:38.230 --> 26:39.966
or to citizens, for that matter.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.001
MEGAN: Hey, my heart bleeds for
the hair appointment

26:42.034 --> 26:44.203
you're going to miss
and the date you're not going

26:44.236 --> 26:46.839
to get tonight, but assuming
you know how I feel

26:46.873 --> 26:49.008
about the Constitution
just makes you look stupid.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.920
Wow.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.189
I think I preferred
the sarcastic

27:03.222 --> 27:05.324
yet still
friendly Megan.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.960
That side of you actually
just scared me a little bit.

27:18.705 --> 27:19.806
Hey, are you all right?

27:19.839 --> 27:23.175
Yeah. Sorry.

27:23.209 --> 27:26.345
You know, swearing an oath
to the FBI was the first time

27:26.378 --> 27:29.916
in my life I... I ever felt
like I was a part of something.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.718
I felt good,
you know?

27:31.751 --> 27:33.119
I-I liked what I was doing.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.987
Past tense?

27:35.021 --> 27:37.824
Let's just say

27:37.857 --> 27:40.359
the past six weeks
put some beliefs to the test,

27:40.392 --> 27:43.029
and I'm not sure that I passed.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.031
Well, you may be
talking

27:45.064 --> 27:46.232
to the wrong guy.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.100
I come from five generations

27:48.134 --> 27:50.803
of duty, honor,
following orders.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.739
Yeah? Whose orders
were you following

27:52.772 --> 27:54.707
when you went out
on that bridge?

27:54.741 --> 27:58.044
Something's going
on with you, Colby.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.946
David told me what happened
with Carter.

27:59.979 --> 28:04.116
Yeah, well, me
and Dwayne is...

28:04.150 --> 28:06.052
I mean, it's complicated.

28:06.085 --> 28:09.288
Why? Because he saved your life?

28:09.321 --> 28:12.091
Among other things.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.864
Everything just seems
complicated now.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.311
Just the two?

28:32.344 --> 28:33.946
Just the two.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.048
Only one we need alive
is the reporter.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.226
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.761
Hey, how's Ashby?

28:48.795 --> 28:52.932
He's still alive.
I mean, they don't know why.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.234
I don't know what it is about
the guy-- it's like I feel...

28:55.267 --> 28:57.103
Feel obligated
to see

28:57.136 --> 28:59.005
his work through, right?

28:59.038 --> 29:01.373
Yeah. Why do you think?
'Cause he picked us?

29:01.407 --> 29:05.444
Maybe it makes you think
what will my life come down to?

29:05.477 --> 29:08.014
A couple of papers,
a few ideas?

29:08.047 --> 29:09.281
He's smart, huh?

29:09.315 --> 29:10.449
Yeah.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.818
Like your kind of smart?

29:11.851 --> 29:13.052
Yeah.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.254
It's amazing how
you guys see things.

29:15.287 --> 29:19.325
You know, how you spin them.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.932
Hey, we got

29:25.965 --> 29:27.834
- a wireframe of the bridge?
- Yeah.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.201
(computer trilling)

29:29.235 --> 29:30.870
Can-Can you just
spin it?

29:30.903 --> 29:32.071
(computer trilling)

29:32.104 --> 29:33.339
Can I use this thing?

29:33.372 --> 29:35.374
Yeah, sure.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.343
DON:
There were explosives here...

29:37.376 --> 29:38.878
here...

29:38.911 --> 29:40.579
and here.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.015
Can you show me more
of a side view?

29:43.049 --> 29:45.818
(typing,
computer trilling)

29:45.852 --> 29:46.919
And more explosives

29:46.953 --> 29:51.190
here, here, here and here.

29:51.223 --> 29:54.293
Can you turn it,
like, uh, 90 degrees?

29:54.326 --> 29:57.529
(computer trilling)

29:57.563 --> 29:59.798
Yeah, that's it.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.936
How are you seeing this?

30:03.970 --> 30:06.305
I don't know.
It's just coming to me.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.875
Is that the face
that I make when I...?

30:10.576 --> 30:12.611
It's G-A-B-C-D-E-F

30:12.644 --> 30:14.613
...sharp.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.249
See, I paid attention
during piano lessons.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.985
That's the G major scale.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.419
What do you think it means?

30:20.452 --> 30:21.453
Well, I don't know.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.155
You can't expect me
to know everything, right?

30:26.959 --> 30:28.928
DAVID:
Pending your cooperation,

30:28.961 --> 30:30.897
the U.S. Attorney has
agreed to drop you

30:30.930 --> 30:32.031
as a top
security risk.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.867
Takes the needle
out of your arm.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.236
Life imprisonment--
that's the best you guys can do?

30:37.269 --> 30:38.504
Live long
enough, Dwayne,

30:38.537 --> 30:41.640
maybe somebody's going to change
their attitude toward treason.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.242
Who poisoned Ashby?

30:43.275 --> 30:44.877
The Chinese. No.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.412
The Israelis,
the Russians,

30:46.445 --> 30:47.646
the Brits-- take your pick.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.415
See you before
you die, Dwayne.

30:49.448 --> 30:50.582
You were right.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.020
Ashby was building a Janus List.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.621
I sold him three names. I was
going

30:55.654 --> 30:57.256
to sell him a fourth
when you guys busted me.

30:57.289 --> 30:58.457
Building it?

30:58.490 --> 31:00.559
Yeah, he said someone would,
sooner or later,

31:00.592 --> 31:02.661
and if he could figure it out,
he could keep it safe.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.163
The man was
brilliant,

31:04.196 --> 31:07.399
but he was a head case.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.435
Where's the list, Carter?

31:09.468 --> 31:10.536
You think he told me?

31:10.569 --> 31:11.570
(scoffs)

31:12.571 --> 31:13.906
I'm probably on it.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.508
All I know is, a lot
of people would like

31:16.542 --> 31:18.911
to see that list disappear,
including anybody on it.

31:18.945 --> 31:22.214
But none of them would have
chosen slow-acting poison.

31:22.248 --> 31:24.116
You're saying somebody wants
the list to be found?

31:28.287 --> 31:29.021
Hey, Sinclair?

31:30.222 --> 31:31.924
When you see Granger,
tell him...

31:31.958 --> 31:34.460
Yeah, tell him
I was a much better friend

31:34.493 --> 31:36.963
than he gave me credit for.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.630
What does that mean, Dwayne?

31:38.664 --> 31:40.199
He'll know.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.902
And if he doesn't,
the hell with him, anyway.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.042
I'm gonna go to bed.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.211
Can I lock the door
or is that a breach of protocol?

31:52.244 --> 31:53.445
No, that's fine.

31:53.479 --> 31:56.048
I have a clear line of sight
to the bedroom from the balcony.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.217
I'll keep my clothes on, then.

32:03.555 --> 32:06.993
Lights are on next door.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.727
- I have no cell service.
- COLBY: No, no, no.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.662
They've jammed the phones;
we got no power.

32:10.696 --> 32:11.663
Get into the
bathroom,

32:11.697 --> 32:12.598
lay down in the tub.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.066
It's made of granite;
it'll protect you.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.238
We have a grand piano.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.507
(piano playing ascending scale)

32:21.540 --> 32:23.209
And an organ.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.111
(organ playing ascending scale)

32:25.144 --> 32:27.246
Hey. So, we've tried
18 musical ciphers...

32:27.279 --> 32:28.114
Right.

32:28.147 --> 32:29.448
CHARLIE:
...converting to tablature...

32:29.481 --> 32:30.282
Mm-hmm.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.284
...even frequencies
for each note...

32:32.318 --> 32:33.485
You know what?
I think we're just reaching.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.620
I mean, we're
getting too far

32:34.653 --> 32:36.522
away from the facts with all
this.

32:36.555 --> 32:37.389
Yeah, I think so, too.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.291
Ashby gave us
all our answers here.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.426
DON:
Right.

32:40.459 --> 32:41.994
And here.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.262
(cell phone ringing)

32:44.363 --> 32:45.297
Hey.

32:45.331 --> 32:46.332
DAVID:
Colby's not picking up

32:46.365 --> 32:49.135
on the safe house land line
or his cell phone.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.102
I'm on my way.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.570
- I'll meet you up there, okay?
- All right.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.044
(siren blaring)

32:58.077 --> 33:00.279
Come on... pick up.

33:26.272 --> 33:27.739
They have night vision.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.042
Everything Ashby said...

33:30.076 --> 33:32.644
everything, every choice he made

33:32.678 --> 33:34.246
has a meaning
and a second meaning.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.748
Except Francis Bacon
and the Sun Tzu quote.

33:36.782 --> 33:37.749
Right.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.185
"The more you read and learn,

33:39.218 --> 33:40.786
the less your adversary
will know."

33:43.455 --> 33:46.358
All right, lay down cover,
I'll go move Naomi.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.326
Got it.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.767
CHARLIE:
These numbers gave us

33:55.801 --> 33:57.403
Naomi Vaughn's e-mail address,

33:57.436 --> 34:00.406
and we assumed that he was
pointing us toward her.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.773
But what if

34:01.807 --> 34:03.275
he was being literal.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.212
Pull up his e-mails
to her again.

34:13.352 --> 34:14.620
Yeah, see...?

34:14.653 --> 34:16.388
Okay, see this?

34:16.422 --> 34:17.523
Why...

34:17.556 --> 34:19.491
Why is this e-mail three times
bigger than the others?

34:19.525 --> 34:21.160
(siren blaring)

34:23.395 --> 34:25.231
I don't know.
It's probably some excess code.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.365
Okay, so, can you, um...?

34:36.708 --> 34:38.377
Wait a minute!

34:38.410 --> 34:39.511
Stop! Stop-stop-stop-stop!

34:39.545 --> 34:41.547
Francis Bacon-- Bacon Cipher.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.450
In which each letter is
represented by a combination

34:44.483 --> 34:45.651
of five A's and B's

34:45.684 --> 34:47.853
from which he encoded
and decoded messages.

34:47.886 --> 34:48.854
A's and B's...

34:48.887 --> 34:50.156
For ones and zeros.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.228
Yeah.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.429
Good.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.365
And-And-And-And then,
and then...

34:59.398 --> 35:01.200
Yeah.

35:02.768 --> 35:03.702
"Janus is in
your mailbox."

35:12.744 --> 35:15.847
All he had to do was
hack into her voice mail

35:15.881 --> 35:18.650
and set up a second account,
which she wouldn't know about,

35:18.684 --> 35:21.720
which she couldn't
access without...

35:21.753 --> 35:23.322
NAOMI'S VOICE:
You've reached the voice mailbox

35:23.355 --> 35:25.691
of Naomi Vaughn.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.893
Without G-A-B-C-D-E-F

35:27.926 --> 35:29.495
and "sharp."

35:29.528 --> 35:33.399
ASHBY'S VOICE:
Welcome to the Janus List.

35:33.432 --> 35:35.234
The following people
have been co-opted.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.236
If all are exposed,
the infrastructure

35:37.269 --> 35:39.738
of two intelligence networks
will collapse.

35:39.771 --> 35:43.542
MI-6 Agent Richard Collins
of the UK, by the Russians;

35:43.575 --> 35:46.245
Russian SVR Agent
Andrei Gorelov,

35:46.278 --> 35:47.179
by the South Koreans...

35:48.714 --> 35:50.249
French Secret Service Agent
Laurent Dassin...

35:50.282 --> 35:51.283
You all right?

35:51.317 --> 35:52.718
- ...by the United States...
- Yeah.

35:52.751 --> 35:53.852
- Where's Colby?
- In the bedroom.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.255
United States
Counter Intelligence Agent

35:56.288 --> 35:57.489
Dwayne Carter...

35:57.523 --> 35:58.490
Colby!

35:58.524 --> 36:00.626
...by the Chinese;

36:00.659 --> 36:02.461
United States FBI Agent

36:02.494 --> 36:06.798
Colby Granger,
also by the Chinese.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.201
(helicopter flying overhead)

36:09.235 --> 36:10.269
Colby!

36:12.671 --> 36:13.772
Colby!

36:15.707 --> 36:16.742
Stop right there.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.682
Come this way now,
with me.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.551
Here you go.

36:29.788 --> 36:30.922
(handcuffs clicking)

36:35.327 --> 36:38.897
Some old man makes things up
and leaves them in a voice mail,

36:38.930 --> 36:41.333
just like that, and you're
gonna believe him over me?

36:41.367 --> 36:43.269
Where were you taking
Naomi Vaughn?

36:43.302 --> 36:44.403
I was moving her
out of

36:44.436 --> 36:46.272
the fire zone.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.406
Oh, and leaving
Megan there, huh?

36:47.439 --> 36:49.475
You knew you were on the list;
you were gonna kill her.

36:50.676 --> 36:51.777
No, Don...

36:51.810 --> 36:53.645
We got six countries with
bugs in Ashby's apartment,

36:53.679 --> 36:54.780
but no Chinese-- why's that?

36:56.348 --> 36:57.449
(Don chuckles)

36:57.483 --> 36:58.550
You know what
we're gonna do.

36:58.584 --> 36:59.385
Tomorrow morning,
we're gonna start

36:59.418 --> 37:00.719
picking through
your miserable life.

37:00.752 --> 37:01.653
We're gonna look at
your bank account,

37:01.687 --> 37:03.789
your credit cards
and your dirty laundry,

37:03.822 --> 37:04.823
the whole nine yards.

37:04.856 --> 37:05.857
Are you really
gonna waste

37:05.891 --> 37:07.593
more of our time?

37:12.464 --> 37:13.932
All right.

37:13.965 --> 37:17.403
The Chinese bug
was in the sofa cushion,

37:17.436 --> 37:18.737
where I put it two years ago.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.539
Oh, my God.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.675
I pulled it when David
was in the kitchen.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.944
DON: You understand what you're
saying?

37:25.977 --> 37:28.847
COLBY:
Nothing you don't already know.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.682
Nothing everybody's not
gonna know tomorrow.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.384
David, David,
David, David...

37:32.418 --> 37:33.419
Relax.

37:33.452 --> 37:34.486
How long you been lying to us?

37:34.520 --> 37:36.355
From the beginning, David.
That's what a spy does.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.656
Oh, a spy?

37:37.689 --> 37:38.724
You're not a spy.

37:38.757 --> 37:39.991
You're a damn
traitor!

37:40.025 --> 37:42.428
All that crap about
serving your country!

37:42.461 --> 37:44.463
Come on. Look,
get out of here.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.464
Just get out.

37:45.497 --> 37:46.264
And what was that the other day

37:46.298 --> 37:47.699
on the bridge?
You weren't trying

37:47.733 --> 37:48.700
to save Ashby, were you?

37:48.734 --> 37:49.668
You were trying to buy time

37:49.701 --> 37:51.002
for yourself.

37:51.036 --> 37:51.937
Who poisoned him?

37:53.439 --> 37:54.873
Who poisoned him?

37:54.906 --> 37:58.344
Who gained?

37:58.377 --> 38:00.979
(siren blaring)

38:02.948 --> 38:03.715
FBI.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.617
Let go of that prisoner
right now.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.553
CIA's gonna handle
all this now.

38:07.586 --> 38:08.987
Yeah, and this is
a legal document signed by

38:09.020 --> 38:10.356
- the Attorney General.
- Wait!

38:10.389 --> 38:11.823
- Wait! We had a deal.
- Uh-uh.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.859
We had a deal. I'm supposed
to be traded to the Chinese.

38:13.892 --> 38:14.860
You do something.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.662
Yeah, you had a pretty
slick deal, didn't you?

38:16.695 --> 38:17.996
You had Ashby poisoned
from inside prison,

38:18.029 --> 38:19.431
you exposed
the Janus List,

38:19.465 --> 38:20.866
and then you let
all hell break loose,

38:20.899 --> 38:22.868
and now you're gonna
make yourself useful.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.970
Yeah, bargaining down
your threat assessment

38:25.003 --> 38:26.705
so you could be traded
back to Beijing.

38:26.738 --> 38:27.739
Who the hell told you that?

38:30.075 --> 38:31.677
You son of a bitch.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.681
You son of a bitch.

38:35.714 --> 38:36.882
Nine months.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.117
Nine months, I don't say
a word about you.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.119
You give me up in five minutes?

38:41.152 --> 38:42.688
You tried to have me killed.

38:42.721 --> 38:43.555
No.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.791
I tried to have
Naomi Vaughn killed--

38:45.824 --> 38:46.992
something you should've
done for me!

38:47.025 --> 38:49.861
Just shut up, Dwayne.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.899
(laughing)

39:03.809 --> 39:06.478
Can't believe this has happened.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.414
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

39:12.484 --> 39:14.152
(steady beeping)

39:14.185 --> 39:15.887
(flatline tone)

39:15.921 --> 39:18.757
(alarm beeping)

39:19.891 --> 39:22.594
CHARLIE:
He built that Janus list

39:22.628 --> 39:23.695
so that he could matter again.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.397
And that's what
killed him.

39:27.733 --> 39:31.470
I think this is probably
the way he wanted to go out--

39:31.503 --> 39:33.071
back in action, not...
(clears throat)

39:33.104 --> 39:35.641
not sitting behind
some desk somewhere.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.512
Well, he was pretty spectacular
behind that desk.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.782
That's an amazing mind.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.485
Made him tough.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.554
Made him... brave.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.723
Brave in the face
of danger.

39:53.859 --> 39:54.760
In the face of death.

39:55.994 --> 40:01.700
* What a day to be alive...

40:03.935 --> 40:05.837
* What a day to realize...

40:05.871 --> 40:07.205
Come on.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.876
* I'm not dead...

40:10.909 --> 40:12.744
ALAN: You know, the more I think
about this

40:12.778 --> 40:16.748
Mr. Ashby-- how much
you've told me about him--

40:16.782 --> 40:19.818
the more I feel like
I knew him.

40:19.851 --> 40:20.986
DON:
Tell me about it.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.921
Took two of us
to understand one of him.

40:24.890 --> 40:27.893
"Light many lamps
and gather round his bed.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.996
"Lend him your eyes, warm blood
and will to live.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.931
"But Death replied,

40:32.964 --> 40:35.133
"'I choose him.'

40:35.166 --> 40:37.769
"So he went, and there was
silence in the summer night.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.774
"Silence and safety,
and the veils of sleep.

40:44.643 --> 40:47.546
And then, far away,
the thudding of the guns."

40:49.648 --> 40:51.950
Yeah, I like that.

40:51.983 --> 40:54.720
When it's your time,
just go in peace, huh?

40:54.753 --> 40:55.887
(glasses clinking)

40:57.889 --> 41:01.960
* What a wonderful life now...

41:01.993 --> 41:03.228
See, to me, I think,

41:03.261 --> 41:04.663
I think it's
more about

41:04.696 --> 41:07.866
having to face
a new fight tomorrow.

41:09.034 --> 41:12.270
So rest while you can.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.140
* What a day
to say good-bye... *

41:15.173 --> 41:16.575
You know, this proves something

41:16.608 --> 41:18.076
your mother and I
always knew about you two.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.645
What's that?

41:19.678 --> 41:21.212
You're both right.

41:21.246 --> 41:26.785
* Bring on the evening hours

41:26.818 --> 41:28.286
* I cry

41:28.319 --> 41:33.525
* Bring on the evidence

41:33.559 --> 41:37.829
* Of my life.
