00:48.997 --> 00:51.170
Let's go party.

00:58.757 --> 01:02.344
Yeah, baby.
Yeah. Gilly, get out here.

01:02.970 --> 01:05.438
Yeah. Yeah.

01:06.098 --> 01:08.601
Let's go, baby, we got bitches waiting.

01:11.436 --> 01:17.504
Go. Faster. Put the pedal to the metal.
Party. Go. Go. Go.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.408
Yeah, Jake.

01:23.198 --> 01:24.791
Yeah.

01:30.831 --> 01:36.591
Hey, ladies. We are here. You guys are crazy.
Get ready to party. Yeah. We are here.

01:37.421 --> 01:38.924
Whoa.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.427
Yo, Nathan.

01:45.512 --> 01:52.729
Dude, you're crazy. Yes, I am.
You all right, man? Okay. Yeah, I am good.

01:52.729 --> 01:54.484
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

02:00.944 --> 02:02.867
- Check it out.
- Dude.

02:03.947 --> 02:07.163
Gilly. Yo, guys, be right back.

02:09.161 --> 02:13.127
What's up, homey? Check it out, man.
Good quality. You like?

02:13.127 --> 02:17.003
Thanks, man. This is hot.
That's right. All right, man. Peace.

02:21.089 --> 02:24.760
Two hundred bucks, man.
Dude, that's criminal.

02:24.760 --> 02:28.438
No, it's a fair price.
I make the best fake IDs in Pennsylvania.

02:28.438 --> 02:30.936
You know what? You should put that
on your college application.

02:35.479 --> 02:38.983
Dude. I can't believe
like mainstream you guys are.

02:38.983 --> 02:41.114
You guys are so mainstream.
I got to get you some underground...

02:41.114 --> 02:43.366
Yo, heads up. Coming your way.

02:44.029 --> 02:45.872
Here we go again.

02:59.779 --> 03:01.380
Uh-oh. Here she comes.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.389
- Hey, Karen.
- Hi, Nathan.

03:05.092 --> 03:09.142
Watch it. Watch it? Watch what?
You bumped into me.

03:09.142 --> 03:12.775
Billy. Billy, I am serious.
Listen to me. Billy. Billy.

03:15.686 --> 03:17.154
Come on.

03:21.441 --> 03:23.535
- Is he serious?
- Whoa.

03:24.986 --> 03:28.661
- That was exciting.
- Let's go get drunk.

03:31.493 --> 03:34.791
You ready? Hold it, hold it.

03:36.415 --> 03:39.089
Wait. Ball. Ball. Ball.

03:42.421 --> 03:43.673
Every time.

03:45.424 --> 03:48.143
- All right.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait. Announcement.

03:48.969 --> 03:50.687
A little gift from my dad.

03:52.723 --> 03:56.247
VIP tickets to the first Pirates home game.

03:57.310 --> 03:59.563
Dude, I will drink to that.

03:59.813 --> 04:04.292
Let's have a good night, boys. Let's toast.
Let's do it. A great night. Yeah.

04:09.239 --> 04:10.411
Whoa.

04:20.541 --> 04:23.386
Look at this guy. Hey, wake up.

04:23.920 --> 04:28.758
Look, whoever you are, you got to get out of
here. My parents will be home in an hour.

04:28.758 --> 04:32.639
All right, girls, we got to hurry up.
My parents will kill me.

04:35.474 --> 04:37.067
Trish, do you have any more bags?

04:37.809 --> 04:40.358
You know, you really don't have to
help me pick up all this stuff.

04:40.358 --> 04:42.485
It's okay. It's the least I can do.

04:42.485 --> 04:47.778
If my parents see you here, they might get
really pissed at me, though. Yeah. Mine, too.

04:52.657 --> 04:53.954
Perfect timing.

05:08.757 --> 05:12.269
All right, get those mitts on. Wake up.
Can't believe you're making me fight hungover.

05:12.269 --> 05:17.980
You want to drink like a man? Let's see if you can
fight like a man. Come on, let's go. Hit me.

05:21.102 --> 05:24.447
Come on. Hit me. It's not patty-cake.
Punch me. Here.

05:27.734 --> 05:32.118
Move your feet. I am right here.
Knock my head off. Come on.

05:32.118 --> 05:36.205
Come on, son. Hands up. My boys.

05:38.203 --> 05:39.830
Hands up. Come on.

05:40.914 --> 05:44.050
This is bullshit.
I will tell you what's bullshit.

05:44.050 --> 05:48.512
Bullshit's getting so drunk that you can't
defend yourself. You can't watch your back.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.183
That's bullshit, son.

05:59.015 --> 06:01.814
Come on. Turn around. Move. Let's go.

06:02.060 --> 06:04.262
- Kevin.
- What?

06:06.439 --> 06:08.191
Bet you're glad you went last night now.

06:08.191 --> 06:12.496
Doesn't taste as good on the way out
as it did on the way in, I will bet, huh?

06:14.364 --> 06:15.616
See, this is what I call a party.

06:17.033 --> 06:21.671
You want to hurt me, Nathan?
Don't get mad, get even. Don't lose control.

06:21.671 --> 06:23.999
Think about it.
Clear your head now. Focus.

06:26.001 --> 06:28.220
Bear hug? That's all you got?

06:29.462 --> 06:34.183
Come on. Your mother hits harder than that.
Show me something. You're so slow.

06:34.183 --> 06:36.136
Come on. Pay attention. Come on.

06:39.264 --> 06:41.107
Use your head, Nathan. Think.

06:41.107 --> 06:44.940
You better show me something soon, son,
or you're going to go down. Come on.

06:50.025 --> 06:53.988
I thought we were boxing. You always said
the person that ends the fight was the winner.

06:53.988 --> 06:56.368
Do I look like I am done?

06:57.532 --> 07:01.870
You want to play with no rules? You better
be careful what you let out of the box.

07:04.956 --> 07:07.835
Come on. Get up.
That wasn't that hard, Nathan.

07:07.835 --> 07:09.545
What's the matter?
Come on. Use your anger.

07:09.545 --> 07:13.427
Think about it. Keep control. Look for
an opening. What are you going to do?

07:13.427 --> 07:16.434
You can't punch me. You can't kick me.
What are you going to do?

07:18.219 --> 07:21.560
Come on. Is that all you got?
You got to get me off balance.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.143
Going to dance all day?
You going to show me something?

07:24.809 --> 07:28.070
Good shot. Now we're talking.

07:31.358 --> 07:34.237
I am bigger than you,
but you can take me, Nathan. Come on.

07:42.494 --> 07:43.541
Wait till you get old.

07:44.412 --> 07:46.710
Hey, guys. Guys.

07:48.917 --> 07:53.165
Kevin. You got me.
Finish me off. Take me......

07:54.089 --> 07:57.517
Enough. What? We're just working out.

07:57.926 --> 08:01.813
You look like you're trying to kill each
other. Nah. No, we're good. Right, Nate?

08:05.684 --> 08:07.186
Good job, son.

08:10.355 --> 08:11.732
You....

08:12.107 --> 08:15.447
God, you smell like beer.
Can I take a shower?

08:16.528 --> 08:19.786
I just don't want to get a phone call one night
that you wrapped your motorcycle around a tree.

08:19.786 --> 08:21.616
I wasn't even driving.

08:21.616 --> 08:27.459
Hey, you were out all night. You didn't call.
You're grounded for a week. Are you serious?

08:27.459 --> 08:30.917
Yeah, I am serious.
Why? Do you not trust me?

08:31.459 --> 08:33.427
After last night, not so much.

08:34.087 --> 08:36.966
Did you ever hear that phrase,
"Trust needs to be earned"?

08:43.638 --> 08:45.140
...he doesn't do yoga. Whoa.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.396
- He did yoga before.
- He did not do yoga.

08:48.393 --> 08:50.270
- Tell him.
- You went to a yoga class?

08:50.729 --> 08:54.483
Mom took me. You're serious? See?
And you were in pain the next day.

08:54.483 --> 08:55.943
- Admit it. Tell him.
- When did you take him to yoga?

08:55.943 --> 08:58.740
You didn't ask me about taking him to yoga.
I have to ask you everything that I do?

08:58.740 --> 09:02.870
No. If you believe in secret lives
in this house, I didn't get the memo.

09:02.870 --> 09:06.377
Your dad needs yoga. Tell him. He has more
important things to do with his day.

09:06.377 --> 09:09.456
You really do need yoga. It's good for
your mind. What's yoga for?

09:09.456 --> 09:11.842
Your body. Your spirit.
Tell me a practical application for yoga.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.628
You could use some. That will happen
the day I take up basket-weaving.

09:14.628 --> 09:18.514
Hey, Nathan, you're on clean-up duty. Come on.
Your mother cooked. I worked all day.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.592
- What did you do?
- That's right.

09:41.446 --> 09:43.574
Are you going to spin me? Whoa.

09:44.616 --> 09:46.118
You got it.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.554
You have gotten better and better,
you know that?

09:59.881 --> 10:02.596
You always have new problems.
It's always my fault. What is it now?

10:02.596 --> 10:05.307
It's every single time, Billy.
Because it's mostly your fault, Karen.

10:05.307 --> 10:07.806
It's always my fault. Have you thought
about that? All you think about is football.

10:07.806 --> 10:09.391
If you're so over this,
then just get out of here.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.772
You know what? I will get out of here.
I don't need this.

10:11.772 --> 10:15.071
You're in high school, Karen.
I could have any girl I want in college.

10:15.730 --> 10:16.652
God.

10:23.488 --> 10:25.240
What are you looking at, freak?

10:37.836 --> 10:40.089
Sometimes I do feel like a freak.

10:43.091 --> 10:45.264
I walk around like everybody else.

10:47.053 --> 10:50.853
But inside I just feel different.

10:51.933 --> 10:54.436
Like I am a stranger in my own life.

10:56.146 --> 10:59.571
Or I am sitting at the breakfast table
with my parents,

11:00.275 --> 11:01.822
and I am just like,

11:03.278 --> 11:08.495
"Who are these people?" Don't you think
everybody feels that way growing up?

11:10.326 --> 11:11.623
Do they all go to a shrink?

11:12.662 --> 11:18.835
Not everyone has insomnia and impulsivity and
rage issues, Nathan. I used your technique.

11:20.795 --> 11:23.298
Last night, this guy snapped at me,

11:23.965 --> 11:28.094
and I had this overwhelming urge to run
across the street and smash his face in.

11:29.512 --> 11:30.604
But you contained it.

11:32.307 --> 11:34.935
Yeah. I put the anger away.

11:35.226 --> 11:37.979
I chilled. It wasn't worth it.

11:40.899 --> 11:42.446
That's great, Nathan.

11:42.446 --> 11:47.034
Do you realize we probably would have been having
this discussion in juvenile court a year ago?

11:48.239 --> 11:50.207
You're making progress.

11:54.746 --> 11:56.840
But I still have the dreams.

12:00.752 --> 12:02.675
When was the last one?

12:05.340 --> 12:08.847
Two nights ago. Any new details?

12:09.928 --> 12:11.225
It was mostly the same.

12:12.013 --> 12:13.981
I see the woman standing there.

12:15.016 --> 12:17.610
She starts singing to me.
I think it's a lullaby.

12:17.936 --> 12:19.483
Then comes the attack.

12:31.824 --> 12:33.246
And then it's over.

12:37.956 --> 12:40.590
Nathan, some dreams are based in reality,

12:40.590 --> 12:48.616
but others are our mind's way of handling anxiety
just by pushing it deep into your subconscious.

12:48.616 --> 12:52.812
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Don't most psychiatrists want to

12:53.972 --> 12:55.974
unearth these things?

12:57.016 --> 12:58.984
I am not most psychiatrists.

13:00.520 --> 13:01.646
Our time is up.

13:04.274 --> 13:06.493
- Have a good week, Nathan.
- Thanks.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.006
Go, Talbots, go.

14:04.250 --> 14:08.296
I think you won that match. Definitely.
You know what? You guys are both dicks, okay?

14:08.296 --> 14:11.428
I don't know how you all convinced me
into joining the wrestling team.

14:11.428 --> 14:13.475
It was your idea.
It's fun, Gilly, it's fun.

14:13.475 --> 14:16.179
You know what? It's probably a lot of fun
when you out there kicking ass,

14:16.179 --> 14:18.811
but let me tell you, it's a lot less fun
when you getting the smack down.

14:22.602 --> 14:25.446
Come on, Nathan. Come on. You got this.
You got him. Hold on. Hold on.

14:25.446 --> 14:28.674
You got him. Take him down.
Take him. Damn.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.494
Pin him down, man.
You got this. You got this.

14:32.487 --> 14:35.827
Keep him pinned. Game over.

14:41.204 --> 14:45.254
Yeah, sure. It's easy when your
guy just rolls over for you.

14:45.254 --> 14:49.466
Come on, he didn't even put up a fight.
Could you take him? Yeah, probably.

14:57.929 --> 14:58.930
Whoa.

14:59.222 --> 15:01.566
You joining the militia group or something?

15:02.225 --> 15:05.980
So I go to the gun range three to
four times a week to blow off steam.

15:05.980 --> 15:09.072
I am a virgin.
What else am I going to do? True.

15:09.072 --> 15:11.947
He was there, right?
He was there, but he hasn't called me back.

15:13.486 --> 15:16.706
Here we go again. You look at her.

15:16.706 --> 15:20.661
She glances back at you.
You both totally dig each other.

15:20.661 --> 15:22.290
And yet nobody pulls the trigger.

15:23.454 --> 15:27.375
Grow a pair and make that happen, man.
You act like you're afraid to talk to her.

15:27.375 --> 15:28.675
I am not afraid.

15:28.675 --> 15:33.848
I don't want to go to class. Me neither.
Then do something. Fine.

15:35.633 --> 15:36.850
Watch.

15:40.221 --> 15:41.313
Hey.

15:42.432 --> 15:43.649
Karen.

15:44.142 --> 15:45.815
- Smooth.
- Yeah.

15:46.686 --> 15:50.236
All I am asking is that you do
the minimal amount of work in this class

15:50.236 --> 15:53.284
to give yourself the illusion
that you're actually learning something,

15:53.284 --> 15:58.490
and to give me a modicum of self-respect,
like I am actually teaching a class.

15:59.407 --> 16:03.287
It's called sociology. The study of society.

16:03.661 --> 16:08.963
People. Besides yourselves. You're going to
choose one of these topics on the screen....

16:08.963 --> 16:11.920
to be the subject
of your 10-page research paper.

16:11.920 --> 16:17.638
You should know that your 10-page research paper
is going to constitute 75% of your midterm grade.

16:17.968 --> 16:21.471
Oh, yes, yes, I know, I know, I know.
Your lives have been ruined.

16:21.471 --> 16:27.143
But you know what Mr. Miles is going to do
for you? I am going to assign you a partner,

16:27.143 --> 16:31.523
so that you can learn to share
responsibilities, to share the work load.

16:31.523 --> 16:35.530
Ernesto, you're going to work with Susan.
Nathan, meet Karen.

16:37.069 --> 16:41.950
Gilly, you're going to be working with Sean.
And let's see, Ladislav and Mohammed.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.373
Romeo, Juliet.

17:08.099 --> 17:12.623
Hi, Mrs. Harper. Hey, how are you?
What a surprise? How are you?

17:48.942 --> 17:52.653
I am not doing all the work for you
on this research paper. You got that?

17:53.271 --> 17:54.818
Got it.

17:55.982 --> 17:58.326
You still like games.

18:00.861 --> 18:03.330
When was the last time you were here?

18:04.365 --> 18:06.493
You had a bunk bed.

18:08.077 --> 18:09.203
Wow.

18:10.162 --> 18:17.550
Hey. Kids want something to eat or drink
or some more pillows to sit on the floor?

18:17.550 --> 18:18.925
Mom.

18:19.171 --> 18:23.259
Okay. You want the door open or closed?
Close it. Please.

18:25.219 --> 18:26.596
Okay.

18:33.894 --> 18:37.569
Uh, well, we should probably get to work.

18:39.609 --> 18:43.239
Says here over 2,300 Americans
are reported missing every day.

18:45.197 --> 18:47.996
I found a website for missing kids here.

18:49.410 --> 18:58.757
They have height, weight, age, favorite
foods, medical reports. Check it out.

19:00.671 --> 19:02.093
Wow.

19:02.423 --> 19:06.556
Last place they were seen. People they
were affiliated with. Everything.

19:07.553 --> 19:08.930
Yeah.

19:15.645 --> 19:18.273
I will send you this link.

19:21.651 --> 19:26.034
What was that story I heard about you waking up
in your underwear on the lawn after that party?

19:29.784 --> 19:33.163
Just a practical joke.

19:33.163 --> 19:34.881
- Right.
- Not worth explaining.

19:37.350 --> 19:41.254
And I had pants on. Yeah.

19:45.966 --> 19:50.141
I thought your boyfriend was going to take a
swing at me that night. He's not my boyfriend.

19:51.639 --> 19:52.640
Hmm.

19:54.266 --> 19:56.769
What'd you say to him anyway
to make him back off so quickly?

19:56.769 --> 19:58.900
I told him that
you'd kick him in his big fat head

19:58.900 --> 20:02.358
and embarrass him in front of everyone
if he didn't stop acting like a dick.

20:02.733 --> 20:05.202
How'd you know
I would have kicked him in the head?

20:05.569 --> 20:11.500
How long have we lived across the street
from each other, Nathan? Hey, check this out.

20:14.537 --> 20:15.959
What is it?

20:15.959 --> 20:21.340
I found this site that shows you mock-ups
of what missing kids might look like today.

20:21.340 --> 20:25.765
And if you recognize a person,
you can click on their childhood pics.

20:26.966 --> 20:28.684
Check out this guy.

20:28.684 --> 20:33.022
Jason Statham meets Justin Bieber.

20:33.022 --> 20:35.316
Seriously.

20:35.683 --> 20:37.185
Uh, next.

20:38.853 --> 20:39.979
Oh.

20:42.523 --> 20:45.026
Ryan Seacrest meets.....

20:45.693 --> 20:47.821
- Lady Gaga.
- Whoa.

20:49.613 --> 20:51.331
Next.

20:52.450 --> 20:54.452
Matt Damon meets.....

20:57.538 --> 20:58.790
you.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.835
That doesn't look like me.

21:02.626 --> 21:04.970
Nope. You're right.
It's definitely not you.

21:04.970 --> 21:07.047
This kid's too cute.

21:11.510 --> 21:13.808
- Could you send me a link to that site?
- Yeah.

21:19.018 --> 21:23.524
My uncle's coming to check up on me
because my folks are out of town.

21:24.398 --> 21:26.821
When did you want to start outlining?

21:28.903 --> 21:31.076
How about I come over in an hour?

21:31.697 --> 21:34.871
Yeah, yeah, awesome. Bye.

21:49.298 --> 21:50.424
Weird.

22:46.397 --> 22:48.991
You're going to put me off my food now.

23:00.744 --> 23:03.344
Marlin and Lorna Price?

23:14.425 --> 23:16.427
So the lemon and then the capers.

23:18.053 --> 23:20.226
- Saute it a bit.
- Hey, what's going on?

23:21.724 --> 23:27.234
Hey, where do you think you're going? What?
Come here. Did you forget you were grounded?

23:28.522 --> 23:31.446
Nathan. Your mother said get over here.
Get over here.

23:34.737 --> 23:39.375
What's up? Are you going to Karen's?
Yeah, it's for a school project. What project?

23:41.619 --> 23:44.042
It's on websites.

23:44.496 --> 23:48.759
Can I go? And you have to get it done tonight?
And it has to be finished? Pretty much.

23:48.759 --> 23:51.553
- For school?
- For school.

23:52.504 --> 23:54.632
- If it's for school, right?
- Right.

23:55.215 --> 24:00.220
He's still grounded. Right. Okay.
It's work. Okay.

24:00.220 --> 24:03.182
Okay. Be quick. Understood.
Be back for dinner.

24:03.766 --> 24:07.107
Deal. Bye. And behave yourself.

24:15.986 --> 24:18.994
Our little boy.
I can't believe I just agreed to that.

24:18.994 --> 24:22.577
God, Karen.
I remember when she was just a child.

24:22.826 --> 24:24.749
She's kind of hot now.

24:25.287 --> 24:30.583
She's sweet. And kind. Sweet. Did I...
I meant kind. And he's a good boy. Yeah.

24:30.583 --> 24:35.340
All right, I see the resemblance, but I
really don't think this is you, Nathan.

24:35.673 --> 24:38.176
Okay, good. Tell me why.

24:38.801 --> 24:42.101
First of all,
this kid's three-and-a-half years old.

24:42.101 --> 24:49.110
Don't we all look the same at that age? Yes.
But we have the same exact chin. Coincidence.

24:49.853 --> 24:52.857
Fine. Explain this.

24:54.858 --> 25:00.031
Okay. It's a similar shirt. Not just the
shirt. The stain on the left shoulder.

25:06.286 --> 25:08.505
Here. Look.

25:14.086 --> 25:15.633
Holy shit.

25:21.635 --> 25:23.558
Online contact.

25:28.684 --> 25:31.312
Steven Price.

25:52.332 --> 25:55.051
My name is Marisa.

25:56.670 --> 25:58.388
Marisa?

25:59.923 --> 26:01.015
Nathan.....

26:06.263 --> 26:07.685
Possibly.

26:08.057 --> 26:11.357
Can you tell me more?

26:22.488 --> 26:24.161
I mean, I don't get it.

26:24.573 --> 26:28.749
Don't you think it's weird that
she wants to know what your address is?

26:35.459 --> 26:39.175
Why does it matter where you are now?
You could just be tipping them off.

26:39.175 --> 26:42.177
It's really suspicious to me, Nathan.
It doesn't feel right.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.223
Don't you think you should
talk to your parents about this?

26:50.849 --> 26:55.900
Mr. Kozlow. You wanted me to notify you
immediately if the website got a hit.

26:59.942 --> 27:02.411
And if anyone ever finds out,
then you're going to get in trouble

27:02.411 --> 27:03.988
because it's probably a false accusation.

27:03.988 --> 27:06.824
And then I am going to get in trouble
because now I am involved, too.

27:06.824 --> 27:07.999
Don't you think it's weird?

27:12.913 --> 27:15.587
Maybe this is all just a mistake.

27:15.587 --> 27:19.754
You could be adopted. You know,
dropped on a doorstep. You never know.

27:22.339 --> 27:27.644
If I were adopted, why would my picture
end up on a missing persons website?

27:28.595 --> 27:35.811
A better question would be if this is for real,
then who are those people living in your house?

27:36.036 --> 27:37.733
We're going to be out there, 
We're going to dive...

27:37.733 --> 27:41.659
He's going to want to dive with us, okay?
We need you to study. All right?

27:41.659 --> 27:43.201
Rigging. How weather changes.

27:43.402 --> 27:45.154
There will be times your
mother and I are asleep.

27:45.154 --> 27:47.331
You got to take the helm.
Our lives will be in your hands.

27:47.331 --> 27:50.205
I don't want to make this sound too ominous,
but it's dangerous out there.

27:50.205 --> 27:52.753
The ocean is a big scary beast, man.

28:07.634 --> 28:08.851
What you got there?

28:10.345 --> 28:11.437
Um.....

28:13.390 --> 28:15.438
I lost my driver's license.

28:16.059 --> 28:19.355
Need this to get a new one.
That what's really going on?

28:19.730 --> 28:23.108
Yeah, what else would be going on?
You're not getting a fake ID?

28:23.609 --> 28:24.511
No.

28:28.322 --> 28:32.080
What's going on, man? Oh, man.
I don't know. Must be losing my mind.

28:32.080 --> 28:36.380
My parents are too boring to be psychos.
Hey, you never know, man.

28:37.164 --> 28:39.542
Now here's you at two years old.

28:40.375 --> 28:41.547
Three-ish.

28:42.252 --> 28:43.674
Five.

28:44.755 --> 28:46.428
Nice. Nice.

28:51.053 --> 28:52.771
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

28:54.348 --> 28:58.560
Okay. You see this picture of you when you
were five? Yeah, why? It's cropped weird.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.817
Slight outline of a person's shoulder.

29:01.063 --> 29:04.984
Clearly zoomed in a touch, like someone
didn't want to be seen in this picture.

29:04.984 --> 29:08.825
Any more photographs of you when you were
younger? Those are the ones that are questionable.

29:08.825 --> 29:10.201
Not really.

29:10.489 --> 29:15.293
Just a ton more of me by myself. A few family
photos is all you have from your childhood?

29:16.787 --> 29:19.210
All that I could find.

29:20.332 --> 29:23.461
Nathan, I have got a million
embarrassing family photos.

29:23.461 --> 29:28.140
Enough to make me want to vomit.
And you're telling me all you have is two?

29:45.190 --> 29:49.528
What? You're too cool to say hi now? Hi.

29:59.579 --> 30:00.922
Teenagers.

30:14.636 --> 30:15.933
Hi, bud.

30:17.180 --> 30:18.978
What you looking at?

30:31.737 --> 30:33.455
Your baby shirt.

30:35.032 --> 30:37.000
Are you my mother?

30:41.538 --> 30:43.256
You are my son.

30:44.583 --> 30:48.053
You don't understand, baby.
It's complicated. Answer me.

30:48.879 --> 30:51.428
Are you my mother?

30:55.761 --> 30:58.935
No, Nathan. I am not.

31:02.225 --> 31:05.729
We wanted to tell you for so long
and we just couldn't.

31:07.064 --> 31:10.944
Go ahead. Tell me. All of it.

31:14.905 --> 31:17.784
Kevin's a part of this. I got to go.

31:19.951 --> 31:22.500
Sweetie, don't judge us so quickly,
all right?

31:22.500 --> 31:24.456
You don't know.

31:26.583 --> 31:28.256
I love you.

31:28.794 --> 31:30.796
You're what's made us a family.

31:32.506 --> 31:35.601
I love you and you're my son.
Nothing's going to change that.

31:38.929 --> 31:39.930
Don't.

31:43.517 --> 31:44.860
Don't.

31:47.854 --> 31:49.481
I am so sorry.

31:50.607 --> 31:52.405
Don't hate me, okay?

31:54.486 --> 31:56.580
Got to go get your dad.

32:09.126 --> 32:12.346
Yeah?
Hey. I heard you pull up, so.....

32:12.754 --> 32:15.758
Karen, it's true. My mom just admitted it.

32:15.758 --> 32:19.596
What? God, Nathan, you must be
freaking out. I will be over in a minute.

32:19.596 --> 32:21.976
Okay, come in the back door.

32:31.773 --> 32:33.150
I am so sorry.

32:45.537 --> 32:49.716
Ms. Harper? Yes. How are you this evening?
Fine, thank you.

32:49.716 --> 32:52.340
We're investigators with the
Bridgewater Juvenile Justice Department.

32:55.505 --> 33:01.686
It's about your son Nathan. I have a couple
questions for him. May we come in for a moment?

33:01.686 --> 33:03.183
Wait, wait, wait.

33:06.683 --> 33:08.230
Kev.

33:09.644 --> 33:11.567
Where is he? Where is he?

33:11.855 --> 33:13.448
Tell us where he is.

33:32.501 --> 33:34.378
You can't have my son.

33:47.432 --> 33:48.558
Who are you?

33:57.776 --> 33:59.574
Get it started. I will get the kid.

34:48.159 --> 34:49.251
Mara.

35:06.928 --> 35:10.812
Go, Nathan, go. Go now.
No, son. Run.

35:11.141 --> 35:12.768
And don't stop.

35:31.328 --> 35:32.830
Karen.

35:35.332 --> 35:37.755
Hey. Get in the house.

35:40.337 --> 35:42.055
Come on, move.

35:45.075 --> 35:47.999
It's going to be all right.
You're going to be fine.

35:48.178 --> 35:51.523
You won't even feel this.
Such a waste, you know that?

35:52.599 --> 35:53.600
Hey.

36:35.767 --> 36:37.735
Who are you?

36:38.395 --> 36:44.321
Who are you? Answer me. Answer me.
Nathan, stop. You killed my parents.

36:44.321 --> 36:46.495
Stop. Stop.
I will tell you what you need to know.

36:47.237 --> 36:50.741
But I am not dying here.
There's a bomb in the oven.

36:52.116 --> 36:53.163
What?

37:00.309 --> 37:01.961
Oh, my God.

37:17.058 --> 37:18.731
Dive.

38:35.303 --> 38:37.101
Sir, you're next.

38:43.228 --> 38:46.172
Dr. Pedway...

38:57.992 --> 39:00.370
Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.

39:03.832 --> 39:08.173
How bad is it? I don't know. It hurts.
I am taking you to the hospital.

39:33.278 --> 39:36.498
We need a doctor. Anybody?
We need a doctor, please.

39:56.050 --> 39:58.178
Hello? Hello?

39:58.970 --> 40:02.356
911. What's your emergency?
My parents were just murdered.

40:02.356 --> 40:07.232
And I think the people who did it are after
me, too. What's your location, sir?

40:09.731 --> 40:11.950
I am at a hospital.

40:12.358 --> 40:16.788
Vassar Brothers Hospital. But my parents
were killed at 2009 Clearwater Drive.

40:17.780 --> 40:19.327
Please hold.

40:19.616 --> 40:22.460
Hold? What do you mean, "Hold"?

40:23.119 --> 40:24.541
Clearwater Drive.

40:26.623 --> 40:31.174
I am Slade McKassen: Topping our news,
a dramatic fire in suburban Bridgewater

40:31.174 --> 40:33.471
believed to have been caused by a gas leak.

40:34.297 --> 40:36.800
There have been
no reported injuries at this time.

40:37.342 --> 40:41.347
Police say the residents were out of town
at the time of the incident.

40:41.347 --> 40:44.481
We will have more later on in
our broadcast. Nathan?

40:45.266 --> 40:46.893
Nathan, are you there?

40:47.685 --> 40:49.813
- Yes.
- Are you okay?

40:51.230 --> 40:56.282
I am shaken up a bit, but...
Wait. How'd you know my name?

40:58.738 --> 41:00.365
My name's Frank Burton.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.993
- I work for the CIA.
- The CIA?

41:03.993 --> 41:08.335
Why am I talking to the CIA? I need to
know if you're okay. Am I okay?

41:08.998 --> 41:12.586
I just saw my parents get murdered
in front of my eyes.

41:12.586 --> 41:17.386
Have you spoken to anyone since the incident?
Beside Karen Murphy? No.

41:17.386 --> 41:21.265
Good. Don't talk to anyone. Don't contact
anyone. Stay right where you are.

41:21.265 --> 41:25.144
There will be two men coming to find you
shortly. One's wearing a red flannel shirt.

41:25.144 --> 41:28.851
They're there to help you.
Nathan, you have to trust me.

41:28.851 --> 41:30.819
Trust needs to be earned.

41:32.730 --> 41:34.027
Nathan? Nathan?

41:34.027 --> 41:36.196
Why am I talking to the CIA?

41:37.110 --> 41:39.704
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

41:40.613 --> 41:43.913
I just saw my parents get murdered
in front of my eyes.

41:46.285 --> 41:47.707
Yeah?

41:49.622 --> 41:53.672
They're at Vassar Brothers Hospital.
It's about 10 minutes away.

41:56.879 --> 41:59.598
One of the ER doctors
will come check on you soon.

42:02.301 --> 42:05.350
I want the video feeds from every
security camera in that hospital.

42:10.977 --> 42:12.274
Put this on.

42:13.438 --> 42:14.815
What?

42:15.857 --> 42:17.484
Dr. Bennett? What are you doing here?

42:17.484 --> 42:20.320
There's no time to explain, Nathan.
We have got to get out of here.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.577
Put that on. Walk behind me.
Cover your face from the cameras.

42:23.577 --> 42:27.001
What do you have to do with all this?
I am a friend of your father's.

42:27.001 --> 42:30.922
My father was just killed.
I am talking about your real father.

42:32.582 --> 42:38.300
Wait. What? Karen.
There's no time. I came for you, Nathan.

42:38.921 --> 42:40.514
I am not leaving without her.

42:43.760 --> 42:44.932
They're here already.

42:50.224 --> 42:52.192
- We're on site.
- Where's my surveillance video?

42:53.603 --> 42:55.480
- Hey.
- Hi.

42:55.980 --> 42:57.607
It's okay. She's my.....

42:57.607 --> 43:00.280
Doesn't matter. Let's go. Yeah.

43:00.610 --> 43:04.747
I am looking for these two teenagers.
My nephew and his girlfriend. They run away.

43:08.510 --> 43:10.282
Go fast.

43:13.473 --> 43:14.816
Faster.

43:17.794 --> 43:18.841
Come on.

43:23.775 --> 43:26.973
Left. Take the exit. Go left.

43:30.515 --> 43:32.313
- We're in.
- Where are you, Nathan?

43:33.184 --> 43:35.186
- Where is it?
- Over here.

43:41.067 --> 43:42.489
I hate balloons.

43:44.570 --> 43:45.696
We have got a hit.

43:48.407 --> 43:50.125
We have a visual on the target.

43:50.576 --> 43:52.249
Garage. Second floor.

43:55.331 --> 43:56.753
Stop.

43:58.042 --> 44:03.222
Target is fleeing. Westbound. Late model
silver BMW. We're in pursuit. Stay on him.

44:03.222 --> 44:07.556
Sir. What? FaceRec got another hit.
You should take a look.

44:11.473 --> 44:13.770
You can kiss your pension goodbye, Geri.

44:14.308 --> 44:15.855
Nathan.

44:16.686 --> 44:18.939
There will be time for you
to deal emotionally with all of this,

44:18.939 --> 44:21.023
but right now,
you have to get your shit together.

44:23.985 --> 44:25.202
Who are you really?

44:26.000 --> 44:28.243
Agent Brock, target is proceeding south.

44:28.243 --> 44:31.496
I am one of your keepers, Nathan.
I am put in place to look after you.

44:31.496 --> 44:34.045
Just like Mara and Kevin were.
They died protecting you.

44:34.045 --> 44:36.122
This is crazy.
Call the police or something.

44:36.122 --> 44:38.799
I already tried.
I dialed 911 back at the hospital,

44:38.799 --> 44:41.594
and some guy came on the line
saying he was with the CIA.

44:42.003 --> 44:45.347
Frank Burton. Burton? I work for him.
What? Or I did.

44:46.257 --> 44:49.514
He can't be trusted. There were only
four of us who knew your identity.

44:49.514 --> 44:52.518
Mara, Kevin, me and Burton.
Two of us are dead.

44:53.097 --> 44:56.522
Until I can get in touch with Martin,
we have to consider Burton unreliable.

44:58.644 --> 45:01.246
Target heading
west over the Fourth Street Bridge.

45:02.732 --> 45:09.489
Here. 4-3-1-1 Clarendon Boulevard. Apartment 2.
Arlington, Virginia. Memorize the address.

45:09.489 --> 45:11.916
Find your way there and just sit tight
until someone contacts you.

45:11.916 --> 45:13.664
What? We're just supposed to
wait for someone?

45:13.664 --> 45:16.963
It's the arrangement I made with your father
in case something like this ever happened.

45:16.963 --> 45:19.541
Who is my father?
Who were my real parents?

45:19.832 --> 45:21.084
She has heard too much already.

45:21.084 --> 45:23.928
What? Are you serious?
As soon as you can, dump those clothes.

45:23.928 --> 45:27.591
Agent Brock, we're recalculating the
coordinates. Now in less than 20 seconds,

45:27.591 --> 45:29.596
we're going to hit a soft curve
just before the bridge.

45:29.596 --> 45:31.973
I am going to slow down
just enough for you to jump out.

45:31.973 --> 45:35.606
Jump? What? Their field of vision will be
obscured. It's 30 feet down to the river.

45:35.606 --> 45:40.273
Dr. Bennett, this is insane. Fifteen seconds.
And remember, from now on, do not trust anybody

45:40.273 --> 45:45.400
except Martin Price and Paul Rasmus.
I don't even know these people. I need answers.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.235
You have been looking for answers
your whole life.

45:47.235 --> 45:50.288
You just didn't know what questions to ask.
You can do this, Nathan.

45:50.288 --> 45:52.206
Now you have 10 seconds to open that door.

45:52.573 --> 45:56.077
After you jump, I will create a diversion.
I don't know if I can handle this.

45:56.077 --> 45:58.754
Five seconds. Leave the girl.
You're better off alone.

45:58.754 --> 46:00.251
- Where am I supposed to go?
- Just trust me.

46:01.958 --> 46:04.464
Take a breath. Jump. Now.
It's going to be okay.

46:04.464 --> 46:06.295
Ready..... jump.

46:08.506 --> 46:10.099
Get out of here.

46:13.594 --> 46:16.063
One lousy state trooper?
That's all you could get?

46:16.063 --> 46:18.896
- Don't lose that kid.
- We're on it, chief.

46:44.458 --> 46:46.335
Come on. Let's go.

46:49.797 --> 46:53.601
All right, we have to get in the river. What?
Why? Because he will try and track us.

46:53.601 --> 46:54.890
Right here.

46:57.847 --> 46:58.939
Watch your feet.

47:14.780 --> 47:16.407
Behind here.

47:27.118 --> 47:31.263
Was Nathan Price in the Vehicle?
I want confirmation.

47:33.383 --> 47:37.983
Okay, sit down. Relax.

47:39.096 --> 47:43.651
You stay right here. I am going to
be right back, okay? Stay.

48:16.926 --> 48:20.521
Hey. Come on.

49:49.643 --> 49:51.020
It's okay.

49:53.606 --> 49:55.859
You were crying in your sleep.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.623
- I was dreaming about...
- I know.

50:08.162 --> 50:10.256
You don't have to say it.

50:20.758 --> 50:22.635
I have to get you home.

50:22.635 --> 50:26.222
Nathan, I can't go home.
You will be safe there.

50:26.222 --> 50:30.935
I won't be safe there. We're not safe here.
We're not safe anywhere. Come on. Let's go.

50:30.935 --> 50:35.148
Where are we going to go now? Just walk. I can't
go back there, Nathan. Don't you understand?

50:35.148 --> 50:38.617
My parents are in Italy. And even if
they were home, they can't protect me.

50:38.617 --> 50:40.615
What are we supposed to do? Call 911 again?

50:40.615 --> 50:45.329
Look. Whoever these people are, whatever
they want, they're after me, not you.

50:45.329 --> 50:47.994
I think they will leave you alone.
Do you really believe that?

50:47.994 --> 50:50.375
Or are you thinking about what
your therapist said back in the car?

50:50.375 --> 50:52.127
- Your chances are better alone.
- No.

50:52.373 --> 50:53.590
Of course not.

50:55.584 --> 50:59.339
It's just, suddenly
everyone around me is dying, Karen.

51:00.381 --> 51:02.304
And I don't want anything to happen to you.

51:02.841 --> 51:08.227
We have to stick together, Nathan. Who else
are we going to trust now, except for each other?

51:12.893 --> 51:14.190
Come on.

51:17.022 --> 51:20.777
All right, here's the latest intel
we have on Martin Price's current mission.

51:21.360 --> 51:24.364
Ten days ago, Martin Price obtained
a high-value piece of intel.

51:24.364 --> 51:32.129
Specifically, a list of 25 encrypted names,
US politicians and intelligence officers,

51:32.129 --> 51:35.879
all of whom had sold state secrets
at one time or another.

51:36.292 --> 51:39.546
The list was stolen from this man.
Nikola Kozlow.

51:40.087 --> 51:46.310
Ex-Serbian Secret Service. Now, freelance intel
broker and operative. He wants it back. Badly.

51:47.094 --> 51:49.188
Yesterday, there was
an attack on the residence....

51:49.188 --> 51:52.688
where Martin's son Nathan lived.
Two of our undercover agents were killed.

51:52.688 --> 51:58.982
The attackers were hired guns. Btrava. Connections
tracing them all the way back to Nikola Kozlow.

51:58.982 --> 52:02.364
Martin Price is the agency's
most valuable black ops agent.

52:02.364 --> 52:07.573
Keeping his son Nathan safe from Kozlow is our
top priority. How did Kozlow find Martin's son?

52:08.240 --> 52:13.333
We think he discovered the existence of the boy
a couple of years ago through a cyber attack.

52:13.333 --> 52:17.258
He's been phishing ever since
with fake missing persons websites.

52:17.750 --> 52:20.003
One of his traps finally worked.

52:20.628 --> 52:24.306
Nathan Price is the bargaining chip.
How so?

52:26.925 --> 52:31.351
If Kozlow gets to the kid before we do,
he gets the list off Martin.

52:31.351 --> 52:34.024
What do I need to know
that you're not telling me?

52:35.100 --> 52:39.022
The boy escaped from us last night
with some help from a veteran operative.

52:39.022 --> 52:45.444
Geri Bennett. Her vehicle was empty when we
got there. No sign of her. No sign of the kids.

52:45.444 --> 52:46.491
Frank.

52:54.000 --> 52:59.133
Get this situation under control
before things get any messier.

53:13.555 --> 53:16.229
- Hey, can you take us to Virginia?
- Get in.

53:16.850 --> 53:18.944
- It's crunch time, Frank.
- Yeah, where the hell is Martin?

53:18.944 --> 53:22.944
Last contact we had was the Peshawar drop
two days ago. He's vanished since then.

53:22.944 --> 53:25.242
- The fastest he can make it back here...
- Is about 36 hours,

53:25.242 --> 53:27.160
which is how long we have
got to find this kid.

53:27.653 --> 53:31.999
Track the girl. Track his friends.
Track anyone they have ever spoken to.

53:32.741 --> 53:37.042
Put out an alert to all overseas stations.
Get a fix on Nikola Kozlow.

53:37.042 --> 53:39.415
If they can't locate him,
that means he's probably already here.

53:39.415 --> 53:41.250
So we can add him
to our list of headaches as well.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.503
Clarendon Avenue. This is the street.

53:53.345 --> 53:54.892
Hello?

55:11.757 --> 55:16.103
"Lorna Price. 1-7-9-3-7 Calvary Road."

55:19.598 --> 55:21.896
"G-3-7-7."

55:26.355 --> 55:27.402
What is it?

55:28.106 --> 55:30.484
- I know this woman.
- Who is she?

55:32.611 --> 55:33.908
I think she's my mother.

55:39.701 --> 55:42.204
This must be Martin Price's apartment.

55:48.377 --> 55:50.345
I am going to call my uncle.

55:51.255 --> 55:52.472
Let him know I am still alive.

55:58.262 --> 56:00.264
- Hello?
- Uncle Danny?

56:01.557 --> 56:03.309
I am sorry,
I must have dialed the wrong number.

56:04.935 --> 56:10.782
Karen? Karen Murphy, is that you? Who is this?
Someone who's trying to help you and Nathan.

56:11.233 --> 56:12.325
How do you know my name?

56:14.528 --> 56:15.950
You're in danger, Karen.

56:17.531 --> 56:19.579
There are other people trying to find you.

56:21.451 --> 56:23.249
- Who is this?
- Nathan?

56:23.912 --> 56:26.711
Listen to me, Nathan,
we're going to find you.

56:27.541 --> 56:30.511
You can't hide from us.
For your own safety.....

56:30.961 --> 56:32.258
Let's go.

56:32.258 --> 56:33.923
Kids.

56:41.263 --> 56:42.515
Thanks.

57:11.668 --> 57:14.137
This address could be 15 years old.

57:14.755 --> 57:20.056
You know the chances of finding your mother
living there are... I know. But it's all we have.

57:32.981 --> 57:36.326
- This is an odd address.
- Look at the numbering.

57:38.779 --> 57:40.702
"G-3-7-7."

57:42.532 --> 57:44.876
That's her plot number.

58:28.328 --> 58:30.376
You know what's messed up?

58:33.208 --> 58:35.836
I never knew either one of my mothers.

58:37.838 --> 58:42.768
The one who raised me,
I had no clue who she really was

58:43.343 --> 58:45.562
or what she sacrificed for me.

58:48.265 --> 58:49.892
And Lorna Price.

58:51.351 --> 58:53.228
All she was, was a face in a dream.

58:54.062 --> 58:55.814
Now she has a name.

58:56.815 --> 58:58.909
But she's still a dead end.

59:01.111 --> 59:03.614
Nathan, maybe she's not a dead end.

59:06.950 --> 59:08.918
These flowers are fresh.

59:09.786 --> 59:11.413
I will handle this.

59:14.916 --> 59:16.634
- Hello.
- Hi. How can I help you?

59:17.419 --> 59:19.922
My brother and I just came
from visiting our mother's grave

59:19.922 --> 59:23.760
and we saw that some flowers
had been delivered there recently.

59:23.760 --> 59:26.937
Is there any way you could check
and see who sent them?

59:27.512 --> 59:30.231
We came a really long way to visit her.

59:30.807 --> 59:34.061
Couldn't you just help out
with this little favor?

59:37.898 --> 59:40.367
- Okay. What's the name?
- Lorna Price.

59:49.534 --> 59:53.205
Okay, so the flowers came from Omaha,
Nebraska. A Mr. P. Rasmus.

59:53.205 --> 59:56.258
It looks like it's going to be
a longstanding order.

59:57.876 --> 59:59.128
Do you have an address for that?

01:00:02.506 --> 01:00:05.009
SIGNIT just got a hit
on a name Lorna Price.

01:00:05.467 --> 01:00:07.970
Came from a computer
in a place called Calvary Cemetery.

01:00:09.971 --> 01:00:14.310
Calvary Cemetery. The CIA is mobilizing
a strike team out of Pittsburgh.

01:00:18.313 --> 01:00:21.612
Dr. Bennett said we could trust Paul Rasmus.
We have to find him.

01:00:21.612 --> 01:00:26.330
You want to drive to Nebraska? No. We have
probably been in this car too long already.

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:29.495
We need to ditch it. What then? We'd never
even make it through airport security.

01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:32.373
They know our names, our faces.
I know. I have another plan.

01:00:52.389 --> 01:00:57.937
Tuscarora Pike. Route 15.
You're very close to them.

01:01:20.375 --> 01:01:23.507
Dude. Hey, man. These guys came
to my house asking questions.

01:01:23.507 --> 01:01:27.932
I had to sneak out back. This is some deep,
deep shit. Did you bring what I asked for?

01:01:27.932 --> 01:01:31.303
Yeah, three different IDs in three different
states. Yeah, that works. Karen.

01:01:31.303 --> 01:01:35.816
I went through all your Facebook photos. I chose
the one of you from that pep rally last month...

01:01:35.816 --> 01:01:37.734
because I thought you looked really good in it.

01:01:37.734 --> 01:01:41.563
But I could use the one from the beach...
These will be fine. Thanks, Gilly. Cool.

01:01:43.732 --> 01:01:45.780
Let's move. We should get going now.

01:01:46.234 --> 01:01:48.532
This isn't safe for any of us.

01:01:49.279 --> 01:01:51.077
I am sorry about your parents.

01:01:53.491 --> 01:02:00.666
Listen, if there's anything else I could do
for you, if you need cash or.... we're okay.

01:02:02.209 --> 01:02:03.802
See you, Gilly.

01:02:03.802 --> 01:02:06.275
- Thanks, man.
- See you.

01:02:18.683 --> 01:02:19.900
Tell me when you have him.

01:02:36.868 --> 01:02:43.467
Amtrak train 29, the Capitol Limited from
Pittsburgh to Omaha is now boarding on track seven.

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:47.087
Step this way, please.

01:02:48.797 --> 01:02:50.844
- Thank you. Enjoy your trip.
- I will.

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.897
Capitol Limited, Pittsburgh to Omaha...

01:03:01.897 --> 01:03:05.317
....is now boarding on track 7.
Go ahead.

01:03:09.778 --> 01:03:16.625
Have a nice trip. Once again, Amtrak train
29 now boarding on track 7.

01:03:41.141 --> 01:03:43.394
Good thing it's only one night.

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:47.317
Mmm-hmm.

01:03:54.988 --> 01:03:56.865
Do you remember that summer when

01:03:57.365 --> 01:04:00.494
our families were both
staying at Canadohta Lake?

01:04:02.245 --> 01:04:08.966
After eighth grade. In the boathouse,
we skipped the canoe trip.

01:04:11.546 --> 01:04:14.265
Yeah. I remember.

01:04:16.217 --> 01:04:17.218
Kind of.

01:04:18.219 --> 01:04:20.893
When we came back to school that year,

01:04:21.765 --> 01:04:23.017
how come you never asked me out?

01:04:23.516 --> 01:04:24.984
I don't know.

01:04:27.062 --> 01:04:31.238
I just thought summer was summer and...

01:04:40.784 --> 01:04:42.286
Are we going to die, Nathan?

01:04:47.082 --> 01:04:48.174
No.

01:04:53.588 --> 01:04:55.590
I won't let that happen.

01:05:20.448 --> 01:05:22.621
- Wow.
- What?

01:05:23.368 --> 01:05:25.791
That's better than middle school.

01:05:31.126 --> 01:05:33.970
That's because I know what I am doing now.

01:05:42.095 --> 01:05:43.972
And no braces, either.

01:06:24.554 --> 01:06:26.602
We should get some food.

01:06:28.683 --> 01:06:32.358
Yeah. I am starving.

01:06:37.025 --> 01:06:38.368
I will go.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.537
Okay.

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:49.504
I will....
I will knock twice before keying in.

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:51.877
All right.

01:07:07.764 --> 01:07:12.060
I am on a train, heading south of the city.
Very good.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.276
We're coming up on the Cincinnati station.
We will be waiting at the next stop.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.744
I am so hungry.

01:07:24.614 --> 01:07:26.742
He might like that.

01:07:49.305 --> 01:07:51.148
Shut up.

01:08:09.117 --> 01:08:11.245
Tell me what room he's in.

01:08:15.456 --> 01:08:16.957
No, no, no.

01:08:18.251 --> 01:08:19.423
Pretty fingers.

01:08:22.005 --> 01:08:24.303
Tell me the room. Now.

01:10:13.241 --> 01:10:14.914
You're going to play some more, huh?

01:10:16.119 --> 01:10:17.245
You little man.

01:10:33.445 --> 01:10:36.999
Come on, Nathan. Use your anger.
Think about it. Keep control.

01:10:45.022 --> 01:10:47.821
Come on, Nathan. Do something.
You're going to go down here.

01:10:59.245 --> 01:11:01.714
What can you do? Focus.

01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:05.005
Think about it. Think.

01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:08.296
Think about it.

01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:31.669
Come on.

01:12:14.612 --> 01:12:16.535
Hey, hey.

01:12:30.461 --> 01:12:32.008
Watch it.

01:12:35.758 --> 01:12:37.385
Hold on. I need to catch a breath.

01:12:43.558 --> 01:12:45.231
Okay.

01:13:07.081 --> 01:13:09.709
He really is Martin's fucking kid.

01:13:16.841 --> 01:13:22.313
They can't have got very far on foot.
Let's round them up. Wrap up this thing.

01:13:33.316 --> 01:13:34.568
I didn't get it until now.

01:13:34.568 --> 01:13:38.997
All that time spent training,
wrestling, sparring.

01:13:39.063 --> 01:13:43.409
He was preparing me. For this moment.

01:13:44.327 --> 01:13:47.797
A few days ago,
we were just a couple of high school kids.

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:52.584
Already feels like a lifetime ago.
Because it was.

01:14:05.473 --> 01:14:10.402
Agent Burns, we have a visual on the
target. Going south on route 51.

01:14:18.027 --> 01:14:19.529
- Come on.
- Kid.

01:14:20.613 --> 01:14:21.705
Give it up, kid.

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:26.745
Nathan. Nathan. Nathan.

01:14:27.912 --> 01:14:30.256
Come on, why are you running?

01:14:30.915 --> 01:14:32.292
Look around.

01:14:32.833 --> 01:14:35.086
Is anybody pointing a gun at you?

01:14:35.378 --> 01:14:37.255
We're not threatening you.

01:14:37.922 --> 01:14:42.935
If you're really the CIA,
what's my real name? Nathan Price.

01:14:44.136 --> 01:14:48.182
Steven. Steven Price.
Steven's your middle name.

01:14:48.182 --> 01:14:51.269
They argued about it,
but your mom thought Nathan was better.

01:14:51.269 --> 01:14:54.985
How do you know that? I was at the hospital
the night you were born, Nathan.

01:14:55.731 --> 01:14:59.118
What do you want? I'd like to get
out of this dirt, for starters.

01:14:59.118 --> 01:15:03.198
You kids, you been on the run
for what, 22 hours? Got to be hungry.

01:15:04.865 --> 01:15:06.788
How about I buy you a burger
and a milkshake?

01:15:23.175 --> 01:15:25.269
You must have been hungry.

01:15:37.682 --> 01:15:40.225
Karen, could I have
some alone time with Nathan?

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.789
Agent Burns will help you
tend to those bruises.

01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:49.702
Come sit over here.

01:15:50.995 --> 01:15:53.339
You must have a lot of questions.

01:15:54.165 --> 01:15:58.002
Who killed my parents?
You mean Mara and Kevin? Yes.

01:15:58.335 --> 01:16:02.389
His name is Nikola Kozlow.
He's an independent black ops agent.

01:16:02.389 --> 01:16:03.758
Like.....

01:16:04.258 --> 01:16:06.602
Like my father? Yes. But Kozlow works for 
the bad guys. Martin is... was one of us.

01:16:06.602 --> 01:16:13.059
Like my father? Yes. But Kozlow works for 
the bad guys. Martin is... was one of us.

01:16:13.059 --> 01:16:15.437
The woman you know as Dr. Bennett
trained him.

01:16:15.895 --> 01:16:17.317
Lorna, too.

01:16:18.481 --> 01:16:21.610
Whose idea was it to put me in

01:16:23.569 --> 01:16:25.697
foster care, or whatever you want to call it?

01:16:25.946 --> 01:16:30.789
When your mother died... to be honest, we weren't
sure whether Martin was going to crack or not.

01:16:30.789 --> 01:16:34.293
He was in no condition to raise a child.
He realized that.

01:16:34.747 --> 01:16:39.669
I told him I would make sure you were safe,
so Martin could carry on doing what Martin does.

01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:42.797
What exactly is that?
It's a messy world, Nathan.

01:16:42.797 --> 01:16:46.905
People like Martin and Kozlow
are just two sides of the same coin.

01:17:09.115 --> 01:17:10.241
Listen, kid.

01:17:10.449 --> 01:17:13.999
The world you have just been dropped into
is a world very few people get to see.

01:17:13.999 --> 01:17:16.172
You're getting a glimpse
behind the curtain.

01:17:16.539 --> 01:17:23.467
What we're engaged in here is a polite war. It's
not about bullets and bombs, borders or territories.

01:17:23.467 --> 01:17:26.095
The currency of this war is information.

01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:30.262
Zeroes and ones, Nathan.
Data. And that's what Kozlow's after.

01:17:31.137 --> 01:17:32.810
What does Kozlow want from me?

01:17:36.517 --> 01:17:41.150
Martin recently stole something very valuable
from Kozlow and he wants it back.

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:45.360
If Kozlow gets you, it puts your father
in a very compromised position.

01:17:47.444 --> 01:17:50.539
Why should my father
suddenly start caring about me now?

01:17:50.539 --> 01:17:53.205
Nathan, you don't know
the first thing about your father.

01:17:56.078 --> 01:17:57.751
I know he scares the shit out of you.

01:17:58.747 --> 01:17:59.794
Mmm.

01:18:00.624 --> 01:18:03.298
Byers, report. Torres, report.

01:18:03.836 --> 01:18:05.304
Torres, report.

01:18:13.304 --> 01:18:15.807
This thing that Kozlow wants so badly,

01:18:16.265 --> 01:18:18.734
what my father stole, what is it?

01:18:19.268 --> 01:18:23.523
To the naked eye, it's a sequence of
meaningless numbers and letters.

01:18:23.523 --> 01:18:28.907
It's actually an encrypted list of 25 people
who have sold or traded state secrets.

01:18:29.528 --> 01:18:33.453
Do you have any idea how valuable that
kind of information is, Nathan?

01:18:37.494 --> 01:18:39.337
Your name's on that list, isn't it?

01:18:41.457 --> 01:18:43.676
You have a vivid imagination.

01:18:44.168 --> 01:18:45.590
That's a very dangerous thing.

01:18:53.177 --> 01:18:55.054
- Go. Go. 
- Go.

01:18:56.714 --> 01:18:59.308
Drop. Get down. Stay down.

01:18:59.516 --> 01:19:00.563
Get behind something solid.

01:19:09.335 --> 01:19:11.678
Stay here and keep your heads down.

01:19:15.449 --> 01:19:16.917
Stay down.

01:19:24.541 --> 01:19:25.542
Come on.

01:19:38.097 --> 01:19:39.849
Nathan? Nathan?

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:52.244
What the hell is going on, Nathan?

01:19:52.244 --> 01:19:56.744
My parents' murder, everything we have
been through, it's all about a damn list.

01:19:57.074 --> 01:19:59.702
- What list?
- A list of names my father stole.

01:19:59.702 --> 01:20:03.961
This guy Kozlow came after me, thinking
he'd force my father to give it back.

01:20:05.708 --> 01:20:09.258
The crazy part is I have had it all along
and didn't even realize it.

01:20:09.753 --> 01:20:11.926
It's in the phone
I picked up back at the apartment.

01:20:12.423 --> 01:20:15.142
Martin must have
texted it to himself for safekeeping.

01:20:15.142 --> 01:20:17.436
Jesus, Nathan,
why didn't you give it to the CIA?

01:20:17.436 --> 01:20:23.438
Because Dr. Bennett was right about
not trusting Burton. We're on our own.

01:20:30.607 --> 01:20:33.611
Where'd you get that phone?
The guy on the train who attacked us.

01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:36.447
Hello?

01:20:37.281 --> 01:20:42.503
Convenient thing with cell phones, they can
be turned into listening devices, as well.

01:20:42.503 --> 01:20:46.540
Kozlow. You have something that belongs to
me. Now it's time to give it back.

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:51.670
What use is it to you? Don't be a foolish boy.
Hand it over and you will be left alone.

01:20:51.670 --> 01:20:55.049
What kind of guarantee can you give me?
I can guarantee this.

01:20:55.049 --> 01:21:01.605
If you don't surrender that list, I will be
killing every friend you have. Jake, Gilly, neighbors.

01:21:01.605 --> 01:21:06.231
Even your boring teachers. And when I am finished,
you will be responsible for the death.....

01:21:06.231 --> 01:21:08.979
of every friend you have on Facebook.

01:21:08.979 --> 01:21:13.530
But I think it's one person in particular
you don't want to see get hurt.

01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:21.000
Am I right, Nathan? Her parents arrive on Alitalia
flight 4-4-9 tomorrow afternoon at 3:20 p.m.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.083
If I don't have the list by then,
they're dead.

01:21:25.083 --> 01:21:28.757
You can tell her all about
what it's like to lose your parents.

01:21:28.757 --> 01:21:33.053
It's a feeling you must know by now.
Am I right, Nathan? Or am I right?

01:21:33.053 --> 01:21:37.008
Okay. Okay.
So, how do you propose we do this?

01:21:37.424 --> 01:21:42.562
Simple. I give you a time and a place.
No. I will pick the time and place.

01:21:43.847 --> 01:21:45.339
Somewhere public.

01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:57.003
Someone backtracked our signal.

01:21:57.003 --> 01:21:58.746
Let's go, guys.

01:22:01.865 --> 01:22:03.333
Don't move.

01:22:06.036 --> 01:22:07.037
Good.

01:22:07.538 --> 01:22:11.216
I am only sorry there weren't more of
them there. Yes, sir another thing.

01:22:11.542 --> 01:22:15.383
What? We found a digital record.
Nathan Harper has the list. No, no, no.

01:22:15.383 --> 01:22:18.640
He's on his way to meet with Kozlow
to hand it over. Where?

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:42.039
- Were you followed?
- No, I don't think so.

01:22:42.039 --> 01:22:45.000
I took my 80-year-old neighbor's car.
Can't you tell it smells in here?

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.714
Did you do what I asked?

01:22:51.157 --> 01:22:54.260
- Did you?
- Yeah, man, just like you said.

01:22:55.085 --> 01:22:59.807
Patio section. VIP access only.
It's under 23D.

01:23:02.676 --> 01:23:05.429
- Thanks, man.
- Good luck.

01:23:07.556 --> 01:23:09.729
I wish there was another way.

01:23:10.309 --> 01:23:11.811
So do I.

01:23:23.489 --> 01:23:26.283
I assure you, I have the situation under
control. Do you have the boy?

01:23:26.283 --> 01:23:31.588
No. Do you have the list? No, but....
Then you don't have things under control, Frank.

01:24:15.749 --> 01:24:17.592
- Hello?
- Hello, Nathan.

01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:24.095
Who is this? It's me. I need you to turn
around and walk out of that stadium, now.

01:24:24.095 --> 01:24:27.390
Martin? You sure have grown.

01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:31.648
I know veteran agents who couldn't have handled
what you have been through in the past 24 hours.

01:24:32.391 --> 01:24:36.942
But you can't go in there. Kozlow will
take the list and he will kill you.

01:24:37.604 --> 01:24:41.199
Not if I kill him first.
You're not ready for that.

01:24:41.199 --> 01:24:43.528
- I have made it this far, haven't I?
- You don't need to do this.

01:24:43.528 --> 01:24:46.580
I am on my way. Just trust me, Nathan.
Give me a chance.

01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:49.499
- You had 15 years, Martin.
- Nathan, this is not the time for that.

01:24:49.499 --> 01:24:52.704
- I am done waiting.
- Right now, you need to hear me out.

01:25:15.851 --> 01:25:18.320
- Nathan?
- The ticket's at the foot of the statue.

01:25:52.346 --> 01:25:55.691
Ticket. Please have your tickets ready.

01:25:56.767 --> 01:25:57.984
Thanks.

01:26:12.866 --> 01:26:14.493
Well?

01:26:17.371 --> 01:26:18.463
Where is this kid?

01:26:55.909 --> 01:26:57.582
Burns, do you have anything yet?

01:26:58.036 --> 01:26:59.083
Nothing yet, Frank.

01:27:00.747 --> 01:27:01.794
Where are you, kid?

01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:03.713
Excuse me.

01:27:03.959 --> 01:27:06.670
- Watch it. Get up.
- Hey. Jerk.

01:27:14.761 --> 01:27:16.308
Popcorn?

01:27:22.102 --> 01:27:25.697
I don't understand this game at all,
but I like popcorn.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.909
I am glad you're enjoying yourself.

01:27:39.369 --> 01:27:42.043
What happened? What did I miss?

01:27:47.294 --> 01:27:49.137
You got my list?

01:27:50.255 --> 01:27:54.642
How do I know you won't kill me
once I give it to you? You don't trust me?

01:27:56.803 --> 01:27:58.396
You murdered my parents.

01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:05.674
They weren't your real parents.
I can tell you all about your real parents but,

01:28:09.274 --> 01:28:11.276
I am not so sure
you want to know the truth.

01:28:14.613 --> 01:28:15.705
What truth?

01:28:16.448 --> 01:28:20.419
Martin was, as they call, a Class 5,

01:28:20.419 --> 01:28:23.794
which means he had the authority
to break the Geneva Convention.

01:28:23.997 --> 01:28:28.548
To kill women, children, whatever was
necessary to accomplish his mission.

01:28:28.877 --> 01:28:31.847
But your mother,
on the other hand, so loyal.

01:28:32.172 --> 01:28:37.349
She wouldn't give up Martin's location
even to save her own life.

01:28:40.388 --> 01:28:41.435
You killed her.

01:28:41.848 --> 01:28:42.895
Wasn't my intention.

01:28:44.267 --> 01:28:45.484
She was a stubborn woman.

01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:51.533
Do you remember, Nathan?

01:28:52.025 --> 01:28:53.948
You should. You were there, too.

01:28:54.194 --> 01:28:56.117
Paris, 1995.

01:28:56.530 --> 01:28:58.157
Nathan, think.

01:29:01.034 --> 01:29:02.911
It's a funny thing, the human mind.

01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:06.168
I am trained to pay attention to details,
from the hair on your neck

01:29:06.168 --> 01:29:10.719
to the location of
every security camera in this stadium.

01:29:11.127 --> 01:29:17.055
But in that hotel room,
I made one tiny, colossal mistake.

01:29:17.843 --> 01:29:19.641
I forgot to check under the bed.

01:29:21.555 --> 01:29:22.852
The bed.

01:29:32.774 --> 01:29:34.572
Nathan.

01:29:44.077 --> 01:29:45.920
Go. Go. Go.

01:30:12.689 --> 01:30:14.862
Is this what you're looking for?

01:30:15.317 --> 01:30:18.036
Now we have to give me
what we agreed upon, right, Nathan?

01:30:19.404 --> 01:30:20.576
Hey.

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:27.796
Frank? I have location on Nathan. Where is
he? The seats above the visitors' box.

01:30:27.796 --> 01:30:29.168
And moving fast.

01:30:34.294 --> 01:30:35.796
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:30:36.922 --> 01:30:38.999
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:30:41.885 --> 01:30:42.932
Hey.

01:30:49.684 --> 01:30:51.436
I am sorry.

01:31:04.783 --> 01:31:08.837
Martin? You're alive. That's good.
Where are you? In a shop on the upper level.

01:31:09.079 --> 01:31:14.585
Listen to me. I need you to lead him outside to
the south parking lot. If I do that, I am dead.

01:31:14.585 --> 01:31:20.006
If you stay where you are, you're dead for sure.
Lead him outside. Trust me. Why should I?

01:31:21.758 --> 01:31:23.556
Because I am here, son.

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:46.032
- Hey.
- Watch it.

01:32:32.996 --> 01:32:35.044
Come on, Martin.

01:32:43.381 --> 01:32:44.849
Nathan.

01:32:45.967 --> 01:32:47.435
Nathan.

01:32:49.671 --> 01:32:51.968
Stop, I will shoot.

01:32:58.313 --> 01:33:00.000
It's over, Nathan.

01:33:00.273 --> 01:33:02.571
Trust me, Nathan. I am here, son.

01:33:04.527 --> 01:33:07.906
You're not as good as your father, Nathan.

01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:11.118
You sure about that?

01:33:17.791 --> 01:33:18.883
Martin.

01:33:39.187 --> 01:33:41.281
Nathan? I will take that.

01:33:47.754 --> 01:33:52.163
Now you're just like your dad, huh?
Let's go.

01:34:00.959 --> 01:34:04.759
I told you we had the situation under control,
sir. I have it. Good work. Let me see it.

01:34:04.759 --> 01:34:06.840
- It's still encrypted, sir.
- That's all right.

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:09.597
Let me get it to the lab and I will make sure
you have the decrypted file....

01:34:09.597 --> 01:34:15.310
on your desk first thing in the morning. That's
funny. Martin said that would be the first sign.

01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:19.729
You talked to Martin? He said that you'd
insist on overseeing decryption yourself,

01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:22.690
to give you a chance
to take your name off the list.

01:34:25.191 --> 01:34:26.864
Come on, Frank.

01:34:27.277 --> 01:34:30.371
We got a long debriefing ahead of us.

01:34:30.947 --> 01:34:32.540
Let him go.

01:34:33.449 --> 01:34:35.247
He's family.

01:34:38.037 --> 01:34:39.960
I am sorry. For everything.

01:34:41.791 --> 01:34:47.429
I will see you soon. Martin? Mmm-hmm.
Give the phone to my kid, Frank.

01:34:53.386 --> 01:34:55.434
He wants to speak to you.

01:34:59.434 --> 01:35:03.400
You're very brave, Nathan.
I handled things with Hudson.

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.402
You and Karen won't have to
worry about the agency from now on.

01:35:06.608 --> 01:35:07.700
Where are you?

01:35:08.151 --> 01:35:12.451
I am right here. Watching from a distance.
Like I always have.

01:35:12.739 --> 01:35:18.624
All I ever wanted was to keep you safe.
Make sure you didn't get hurt. But I failed.

01:35:18.624 --> 01:35:21.001
I am sorry, Nathan. I truly am.

01:35:21.539 --> 01:35:23.257
When can I see you?

01:35:24.167 --> 01:35:28.388
Why don't you come out here and talk to me in
person? I'd like that. More than you can imagine.

01:35:29.172 --> 01:35:31.095
- But it's not possible.
- Why not?

01:35:31.591 --> 01:35:33.719
I made certain choices a long time ago.

01:35:33.719 --> 01:35:36.930
I have to live with the consequences of
those choices, but you don't have to.

01:35:37.889 --> 01:35:41.022
Well, then it's up to me.
I want to meet you.

01:35:41.022 --> 01:35:44.775
You don't understand the risk.
I don't care about the risks.

01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.908
You remind me of your mother.

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.743
Martin?

01:35:53.029 --> 01:35:54.121
Dad?

01:35:56.241 --> 01:35:57.618
Nathan.

01:35:58.451 --> 01:36:00.453
I am your father,

01:36:00.912 --> 01:36:03.085
but I will never be your dad.

01:36:03.498 --> 01:36:08.174
I lost that chance a long time ago.
I don't know if you can understand my reasons.

01:36:08.174 --> 01:36:12.215
Maybe someday you will.
But you're the only family I have left.

01:36:13.299 --> 01:36:16.348
You're leaving me all alone.
You're going to be all right.

01:36:17.971 --> 01:36:19.348
Sorry, son.

01:36:21.724 --> 01:36:23.442
Goodbye, Nathan.

01:36:35.113 --> 01:36:36.581
Nathan.

01:37:03.850 --> 01:37:04.942
Dr. Bennett?

01:37:05.393 --> 01:37:06.485
Hello, Nathan.

01:37:07.478 --> 01:37:08.650
Hi.

01:37:09.314 --> 01:37:10.987
Call me Geri.

01:37:11.649 --> 01:37:15.532
I can't believe you're alive. Me?
What about you guys?

01:37:16.446 --> 01:37:18.869
How are you doing with all of this?

01:37:19.907 --> 01:37:22.706
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I am fine.

01:37:26.205 --> 01:37:28.048
It's for your own protection.

01:37:28.416 --> 01:37:29.918
I know.

01:37:30.918 --> 01:37:32.090
But where do I go from here?

01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:36.425
Your father wanted me to talk to you about
making arrangements for a new home.

01:37:36.883 --> 01:37:39.682
Nothing can replace Kevin and Mara.
I know that.

01:37:39.682 --> 01:37:45.733
But we thought maybe you'd want to consider
coming to live with me until you finish high school.

01:37:47.852 --> 01:37:52.945
Then you have college and......
You know, whatever else you want to pursue.

01:37:53.733 --> 01:37:55.485
How does that sound?

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.490
Yeah, that sounds good.

01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:08.507
- Okey-dokey.
- So, shall we get out of here?

01:38:15.088 --> 01:38:16.260
Not quite yet.

01:38:18.758 --> 01:38:20.852
I will make sure he gets home all right.

01:38:21.344 --> 01:38:22.345
Oh.

01:38:22.929 --> 01:38:28.435
I see. Okay. That's cool. I will just...
You know, I will be here. All right.

01:38:30.603 --> 01:38:32.150
And, Nathan,

01:38:33.731 --> 01:38:36.985
about a certain young lady, I was wrong.

01:38:38.444 --> 01:38:40.321
You should hold onto her.

01:38:41.072 --> 01:38:42.449
Yeah.

01:38:44.283 --> 01:38:46.456
She's worth it.

01:38:55.795 --> 01:39:00.137
Sorry we missed the game.
You can take me to another one.

01:39:02.301 --> 01:39:09.685
It's a date. So, you mean this isn't going to be
like eighth grade after the boathouse between us?

01:39:11.477 --> 01:39:14.526
You know what the problem was
back in eighth grade?

01:39:17.233 --> 01:39:19.611
I just wasn't ready for you yet.

01:39:19.702 --> 01:39:23.532
Mmm. So I had to wait four years
for you to ask me out?

01:39:25.658 --> 01:39:27.035
Yeah.

01:39:27.827 --> 01:39:32.085
But you got to admit, it was one
pretty exciting first date.

01:39:33.791 --> 01:39:35.338
Definitely.
