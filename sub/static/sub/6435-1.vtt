00:02.836 --> 00:05.170
(birds chirping)

00:08.842 --> 00:11.543
(heavenly chorus singing
jubilant gospel melody)

00:20.487 --> 00:22.721
Glory be to god!

00:22.723 --> 00:25.157
What's happening, pimps?

00:25.159 --> 00:27.126
(laughing):
Hey!

00:27.128 --> 00:29.461
What's up, dianne?

00:29.463 --> 00:31.964
Oh, this better be good, hmm?

00:31.966 --> 00:33.832
What's up?
You ain't happy to see your boy?

00:33.834 --> 00:35.534
You said you had something
to tell me about jason,

00:35.536 --> 00:36.969
So what is it?
Okay, okay.

00:36.971 --> 00:40.339
Pops said
that he wants you with jason

00:40.341 --> 00:42.074
So much
that he's never,

00:42.076 --> 00:45.077
Ever sending any good man
your way again.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.678
None. Finito.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.214
Whew! So glad to get that
off my chest.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.416
That was a burden on me.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.684
D-d-d-did you just curse me?

00:52.686 --> 00:54.153
Nah, nah, not me.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.320
God. Pops.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.489
Okay, you had me come
all the way down here

00:57.491 --> 00:58.991
To curse me?

00:58.993 --> 01:00.826
Couldn't tell you nothing
like that on the phone.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.661
That's some (bleep) shit
to say to somebody.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.863
Jesus christ,
you are such a (bleep) asshole!

01:04.865 --> 01:06.498
(bleep) you,
you fake-ass

01:06.500 --> 01:08.400
Giant ashy ankle
crusty nail

01:08.402 --> 01:10.836
Stupid-ass hood rat
mother(bleep)!

01:10.838 --> 01:12.771
Looking like a big-ass
sack of potatoes.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.573
You sorry, broke-ass,
dirty mother(bleep).

01:14.575 --> 01:15.774
Bye, dianne!
(bleep) you!

01:15.776 --> 01:17.176
God bless.
Ooh!

01:48.208 --> 01:50.409
(laughing)

01:50.411 --> 01:51.477
Jesus!

01:51.479 --> 01:53.412
(both laughing)

01:53.414 --> 01:55.881
Trayvon:
Oh... Oh... Oh...

01:55.883 --> 01:56.949
Oh, finally!

01:56.951 --> 01:58.484
Man, I'm so happy
to see you, man!

01:58.486 --> 01:59.718
Where the homies at?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.053
Uh, they're, uh...

02:01.055 --> 02:02.421
They're-they're back at fish's.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.089
Oh.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.657
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.726
Oh, all right,
I-I get it, I get it.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.162
They must got something
big planned for your boy.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.563
Tell me they didn't.
They ain't do that, did they?

02:11.565 --> 02:12.564
I don't think,

02:12.566 --> 02:13.632
I don't think so, no.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.234
Okay, it's gonna be cake.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.468
They gotta have cake,
you know what I'm sayin'?

02:16.470 --> 02:17.469
You know your boy love cake.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.504
Carrot cake,
banana cake...

02:18.506 --> 02:20.072
Listen, big guy,

02:20.074 --> 02:21.507
I'm, I'm-I'm just here
to pick you up, man.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.775
That's it.
Pick me up in what?

02:23.777 --> 02:26.111
I'm so glad to be home.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.046
G-o-d, hold it down.

02:29.449 --> 02:30.983
Jesus, I lost my job
over some racist bs.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.918
Hey, that was your fault, man.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.820
Stop blaming the white man
for everything, dawg.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.689
Hey, little rick, are you still
playing football?

02:37.691 --> 02:39.925
Hey, edna, ron!
What's up, y'all?

02:39.927 --> 02:41.293
Orlando! What's up, dawg?

02:41.295 --> 02:42.961
Hey, you owe me five dollars.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.696
Hey, lorenzo!
What's up, dawg?

02:44.698 --> 02:45.998
(jesus laughs)

02:46.000 --> 02:47.266
Man: Yo, jesus,
I can't find my keys.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.667
Living room, couch,
right pillow.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.701
By the window.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.203
Stop losing shit all the time.

02:52.872 --> 02:54.706
Boonie:
Oh, there you go.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.108
Man, you just
getting here?

02:56.110 --> 02:57.476
Where was you
at all night?

02:57.478 --> 03:00.512
Where your ass
ain't never at.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.713
Getting this money, nigga.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.448
Well, maybe I
could give money,

03:03.450 --> 03:05.017
If a certain
selfish nigga

03:05.019 --> 03:06.985
Would let his homeboys in
on his little secret hustle.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.453
Mm-hmm.
Nigga, trust me,

03:08.455 --> 03:10.022
Ain't a damn one of y'all
built for this hustle.

03:10.024 --> 03:12.157
Hey, but what y'all
doing later on, though?

03:12.159 --> 03:14.793
Man, you forgot
what today is, huh?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.795
What's today?
Jesus coming back today.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.363
Nigga, you serious?
That's today?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.565
Yeah. So we good.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.732
Jesus coming back,

03:20.734 --> 03:21.967
I-I know he got a plan from god

03:21.969 --> 03:23.335
To let us know what to do.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.469
Nigga, we ain't good!

03:24.471 --> 03:25.537
We gotta clean
this place up!

03:25.539 --> 03:27.005
Man, get up!
Fish!

03:27.007 --> 03:29.341
Hey, relax,
go wash your ass, man.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.809
We was just about
to clean up, man.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.211
It won't take
but two minutes.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.345
No, nigga, call trayvon.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.880
Tell him we need him
to go to the store.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.181
Trayvon already went
to pick up jesus.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.482
Fish:
When he supposed
to get out?

03:37.484 --> 03:40.686
Man, they're supposed
to be back in, like, uh,

03:40.688 --> 03:43.989
Not that long, man.
Hold on, let me check.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.557
Oh. Shit.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.659
I missed y'all.
Man, I love you guys
so much, man.

03:47.661 --> 03:48.927
I'm so glad
to be home.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.229
(rattling doorknob)

03:50.231 --> 03:52.164
Well! Look who it is!

03:52.166 --> 03:54.066
Jesus christ!

03:54.068 --> 03:56.034
Mr. I'm holier than everybody
in the whole (bleep) world.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.770
(laughing):
Hey!

03:58.772 --> 04:00.005
What's crackin' with you, lloyd?

04:00.007 --> 04:02.007
What you got going
on right here?

04:02.009 --> 04:04.776
What's crackin' is, things
have changed around here.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.278
What residence
are you here to visit?

04:06.280 --> 04:07.613
Aw, come on, man.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.014
You know I'm here
to see fish.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.382
Sign in.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.385
And I need two forms of I.D.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.753
Lloyd, you know me, man.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.355
Come on, man, it's your boy.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.723

04:17.725 --> 04:19.024
I need your
social security number, punks!

04:19.026 --> 04:21.526
Man, this is about
to be so bomb!

04:21.528 --> 04:23.729
You know I ain't never had
no surprise party, man.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.364
I'm about to act
surprised as a mug.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.699
I might get up there and scream
and pee on myself or something.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.368
Is that too much?
Come on, trayvon.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.536
Hey, jesus, I suggest lowering
your expectations a little.

04:31.538 --> 04:32.738
(chuckles)

04:32.740 --> 04:34.139

04:35.608 --> 04:37.542
♪

Trayvon:
I, um,

04:50.057 --> 04:51.823
I told you to lower
your expectations.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.392
The day jesus returns

04:53.394 --> 04:55.727
To walk with his homies
on this earth one more time,

04:55.729 --> 04:56.995
And this is what

04:56.997 --> 04:58.830

05:00.401 --> 05:02.301
But don't even trip, though.
I got something for you.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.502

05:19.286 --> 05:21.253

Sorry there's no milk.
...And this is the
best you can do?

05:23.624 --> 05:25.524
All y'all just like,

"oh, he ain't tripping.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.761
Whatever."

05:29.763 --> 05:31.096
Jesus, man, it ain't

We just been struggling, man.

Under one roof like a family,

05:42.609 --> 05:44.176

05:44.178 --> 05:46.178
That's what he want;
he want us together.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.179
Breaking bread,

05:47.181 --> 05:49.114
Sharing stuff--
sharing cable,

05:49.116 --> 05:49.948
Internet,

05:49.950 --> 05:51.116
Your loops, you know.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.884
Netflix,
blankets and stuff,

05:52.886 --> 05:55.620
Floor space and perhaps
a couch or two?
Fish:
Whoa, whoa.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.888
What's up with all this sharing?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.190
You trying to stay here?

05:58.192 --> 05:59.624
I mean, maybe just
for a night or two.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.959
Fish:
Oh, hell, nah.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.461
We already ain't
got enough room, man.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.695
No room for jesus?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.364
So-so that's what you saying?

06:05.366 --> 06:06.631
No room for jesus christ

06:06.633 --> 06:07.999
In your heart or your crib, huh?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.003
He's sleeping in my bed.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.239
(pounding on door,
all arguing at once)

06:14.241 --> 06:17.008
Hey, I heard

Oh, no, no, nigga.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.144

06:23.916 --> 06:25.517
Hey, what's up,

06:25.519 --> 06:27.986
How was the nuthouse?
Man, you know,

06:27.988 --> 06:29.855
I don't care about
that shit, nigga.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.423
I was just being
facetious.

06:32.825 --> 06:34.393
Your new rent agreement.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.162
Says right here that this unit
has a two-nigga limit.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.363
Lloyd:
Two niggas.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.532
Right now,
I'm counting two, three,

06:40.534 --> 06:41.767
Four niggas.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.001
Anybody that violates
these rules

06:43.003 --> 06:45.504
Is subject
to immediate expulsion

06:45.506 --> 06:46.838
From the complex.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.006
Vic, man, come on, man.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.441
Chill out, man, stop tripping.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.209

Vic:
That's good,

06:51.211 --> 06:53.178
'cause there's also some
new visiting hours.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.247
From 8:00

6:00.

06:55.249 --> 06:58.016
Anybody found on the complex
after those hours

06:58.018 --> 06:59.918
Who is not a resident
will also be subject

06:59.920 --> 07:03.221
To immediate expulsion
from the complex.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.023

07:05.025 --> 07:07.092
To enter any unit
at any time,

07:07.094 --> 07:08.927
Without prior notice,

07:08.929 --> 07:10.462
To enforce these rules.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.364
Management also got the right
to get its ass blasted

07:12.366 --> 07:14.065
If he come in my place
without notice.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.601

A rubber band?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.403
Nigga, you on parole.
You ain't got no gun.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.205
You don't know
what the (bleep) I got.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.541
Look, nigga, stop trying
to act tough with me, okay?

07:22.543 --> 07:25.377
You ain't tough.
You a male model, nigga.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.745
Right now you should be
somewhere, in your drawers,

07:26.747 --> 07:28.313
Trying to sell some perfume.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.715
(lloyd snickering)
obey the rules.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.884
Nigga, do you got
a crush on me or something?

07:33.986 --> 07:36.555
Vic got a crush on fish,
and lloyd jealous.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.557
Hey, ya'll niggas should be
trying to figure out

07:38.559 --> 07:41.159
Which two of y'all is gonna be
getting out of here tonight.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.727
That's right!

07:42.729 --> 07:44.262
Hey, so I told my moms,

07:44.264 --> 07:47.432
"if you talk disrespectfully
to me again, it's on."

07:47.434 --> 07:49.801
That's when she put me out

Yeah, and I got caught lying on

07:53.407 --> 07:56.408

07:56.410 --> 07:58.944
Hey, look, jesus, I ain't gonna

08:01.615 --> 08:03.482
Man, god wants y'all

08:10.591 --> 08:12.924

08:12.926 --> 08:14.626
Major game

08:14.628 --> 08:18.330
You know what I mean? He gave me
the vision and I can see it.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.965
It's so

Yeah, that's what

08:32.144 --> 08:33.712
No, man, I'm serious,

08:33.714 --> 08:36.615
No more jail, no more schemes,

08:36.617 --> 08:38.283
He want us to go out there

08:38.285 --> 08:40.452
And here's the best part:

08:40.454 --> 08:43.788
We gonna be spreading the word.
Did pops tell you
how we supposed

08:43.790 --> 08:46.791
To make this "legit" paper?
Not exactly, but, you know,
we'll figure that out.

08:46.793 --> 08:49.861
Yeah, 'cause we damn sure
ain't figured it out yet.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.531
Fish, where you going, dawg?

Oh...

08:55.068 --> 08:57.702

What about you--

09:11.318 --> 09:12.717
You know what

09:12.719 --> 09:14.152
Man, pops ain't showing me, man.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.987
I mean, maybe
he don't want us to know.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.690
Could be legit.
I don't know, but I saw
what he put in that bag.

09:18.692 --> 09:21.693
What'd he put in the bag?
A ski mask

09:21.695 --> 09:24.029
And a gun.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.464
He going skiing in
a bad neighborhood.

09:35.441 --> 09:37.008
Boonie:

Hey, what this dude up to, man?

09:45.586 --> 09:46.918

Now I don't know

09:53.093 --> 09:54.893
Hey, jesus, use
your x-ray vision.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.095
Boonie, I don't have
x-ray vision, dawg.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.198
Thanks for the ride, pimps!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.866
(stammers)
(fish cackles)

10:01.868 --> 10:03.568
(bleep)!
Man, I had

10:03.570 --> 10:06.538
Damn! We got to walk.

10:12.111 --> 10:16.047
(fish chuckling)

10:16.049 --> 10:17.449
Very funny, fish.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.783
Man, y'all

10:18.785 --> 10:21.252
Man, we were just
worried about you, dawg.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.621
Hey, what you always say, jee?

10:22.623 --> 10:23.955
Free will means you free

10:23.957 --> 10:27.659
God help you.
Ah, whatever.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.429
(sharp banging)

10:31.431 --> 10:33.331
Jesus: What's up
with all that, man?

10:33.333 --> 10:34.799
Visiting hours

10:34.801 --> 10:36.401
Which means all non-residents

10:36.403 --> 10:39.571
Must exit the complex

10:39.573 --> 10:41.973
Two of you niggas,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.482
Go ahead, man.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.183
You sure?

10:52.185 --> 10:54.285

<i>I don't know why every time</i>
<i>I ask y'all to do something</i>

11:28.622 --> 11:29.821
I got to hear this shit.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.823
That bitch
is crossing the line, hear?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.858
Think she gonna
start her own operation.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.827
Listen,
all I need you to do

11:35.829 --> 11:38.296
Is to go over there
and make her understand

11:38.298 --> 11:40.732
Who's working for who.
That's it.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.368
We're not enforcers, mom.
I'll go over there
and teach that bitch a lesson.

11:43.370 --> 11:48.039
Thank you, fish, real man
who I wish was my son.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.841
You know what, ma?
You gonna try that shit

11:49.843 --> 11:51.710
On the wrong person
one day, for real.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.478
I'm telling you.
What, you scared

11:53.480 --> 11:55.380
Of a single mom
who does yoga, boonie?

11:55.382 --> 11:58.583
Really? I'm just asking you
to deliver a message.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.018
I'm paying you, ain't I?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.487
A eighth of some
little bullshit weed?

12:02.489 --> 12:03.855
Jesus christ, ma!

12:03.857 --> 12:05.090
(knocking on sliding glass door)
well, you...

12:05.092 --> 12:06.391
(heavenly chorus sings)

12:06.393 --> 12:08.893
Oh, look who's here!

12:08.895 --> 12:11.096
Aw, jesus! My sweet lord.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.731
Oh, it's so good to see you.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.265
That's what
I'm talking about!

12:14.267 --> 12:15.900
That's how you greet
his high holiness,

12:15.902 --> 12:17.402
You know what I mean?
You like that, huh?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.571
I love it.
Jesus, this spread
is for you.

12:19.573 --> 12:23.575
And look here-- I had a cake
delivered and everything.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.810
(jesus gasps)

12:27.012 --> 12:29.180
Boonie: That's that jesus
everybody believe in.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.516
But (bleep) him, you my man.
This nigga

12:31.518 --> 12:33.685
Don't never
come through.
Anyway, ms. Tudi...

12:33.687 --> 12:37.255
Mm-hmm?
Thank you so much, 'cause you
know, I got cats I mess with

12:37.257 --> 12:38.923
Every day who claim

12:38.925 --> 12:41.292
They love me--
they ain't got no cake.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.561
I know, but look here,
we all did miss you.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.197
We missed you
so, so much.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.032
Jesus: Hey, but did the homies
tell you the amazing news?

12:48.034 --> 12:50.034
No, ain't nobody
told me nothing.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.970
Pops got at me, right?
Uh-huh.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.738
And he gave me the word.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.740
And he told me
he want us to go legit,

12:55.742 --> 12:57.475
Get straight
and make this real paper.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.110
Dig that!
(chuckles)
ooh, speak, lord!

12:59.112 --> 13:01.946
And stay
out of trouble.
Yes!

13:01.948 --> 13:03.214
Man, she want me and
fish to go and...

13:03.216 --> 13:05.450
Boonie, shut up.
Jesus is talking.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.951
Go ahead, lord jesus.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.620
Well, then he want us to
go out and spread the word.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.889
I'm talking about everywhere--
we gonna reach far and wide.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.625
Compton to cairo.
Spread the word,
go legit, huh?

13:13.627 --> 13:16.127
Amen.
(whoops)
I love it.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.629
This gonna cost me some money?

13:17.631 --> 13:20.231
Not a dime.
Hallelujah.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.467
She's so phony with you, jesus.
She want me and fish

13:22.469 --> 13:25.436
To go visit this girl and
enforce some of her weed money.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.472
No, ms. Tudi, see, see,
that's what I'm talking about.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.974
We ain't got to do the janky
shit no more-- we good.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.444
I understand, lord, and, oh,
you know I be trying to walk

13:33.446 --> 13:35.780
In your holy and righteous path.
You know that, right?

13:35.782 --> 13:39.017
Jesus, my weed business
is falling apart.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.186
A-and I still got this
house note I got to pay.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.822
But, ms. Tudi, you...
Oh, I knew you'd understand.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.191
I'm so glad you're back.
Oh, praise the lord!

13:46.193 --> 13:47.659
God is good.
All the time.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.227
Ms. Tudi:
All the time! Oh, huh.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.864
Get it done, hear?

13:54.133 --> 13:56.768
Cake looks wonderful.
(chuckles)

14:00.472 --> 14:02.006
Yo, bitch.

14:02.008 --> 14:05.910
You about to find out
who really runs this shit.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.682
Boonie:<i> Hey, man, so,</i>
<i>you cool with this, man?</i>

14:10.684 --> 14:11.850
<i>You know, us going</i>
<i>to shake down</i>

14:11.852 --> 14:13.484
That yoga chick
and all that?

14:13.486 --> 14:14.986
Hell, yeah, I'm cool.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.822
Nigga, you scared, man?
Just relax. And think about it--

14:17.824 --> 14:19.224
You get your mom
off your back and we get

14:19.226 --> 14:21.759
A pinch of that weed, too.
(knocking on door)

14:31.570 --> 14:34.539
Shalinka? Hey, what you
doing over here?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.507
I need me some me time.
What?

14:36.509 --> 14:39.310
I got a burke williams gift
certificate for my birthday.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.246
I just need you
to watch the kids.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.348
I'm only gonna be gone
a couple of hours.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.084
Just don't leave 'em alone.
I left 'em with a babysitter

14:46.086 --> 14:48.653
Last time.
You left 'em with
a pit bull, boonie!

14:48.655 --> 14:50.221
A pit bull is not
a babysitter!

14:50.223 --> 14:52.190
Hey, that's
a highly trained pit bull.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.058
She had kids before.
Hey, what's that--

14:54.060 --> 14:56.394
The kids out there?
They down there, yeah.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.230
Hey! Hey, what's up?
Boon-boon/boonlinka:
Hi, daddy!

14:59.232 --> 15:01.699
Daddy'll be down
in a minute!
Boon-boon: Hurry up!

15:01.701 --> 15:03.167
Hey, look,
let me tell you something.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.503
Me and fish, we got
some serious business to handle.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.405
You can't just be poppin'
by here like this.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.374
I'm not popping by.
I got your kids.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.377
And what business
you and the pretty convict have?

15:12.379 --> 15:14.279
Y'all don't have
no damn business,

15:14.281 --> 15:16.848
Neither one of y'all,
in here trying to run capers

15:16.850 --> 15:18.917
Instead of getting serious
about life.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.352
All I asked you to do was
watch your kids.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.687
Take 'em somewhere,

15:22.689 --> 15:24.889
Walk 'em down the street,
throw 'em in the air.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.624
It don't matter.
Kiss they cheek.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.427
Do some daddy shit.
It's only a couple of hours.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.895
Dag.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.464
These bitches wonder
why they single moms.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.533
But, look, man, you know...
No "look" nothing, nigga.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.069
You better figure
something out quick.
Hey, man, I got this, man.

15:38.071 --> 15:41.272
See, my moms and link, they
think I'm not a good father,

15:41.274 --> 15:43.775
But I got this-- I know
how to play this.
Watch this.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.743
Hey, kids! Hey!

15:45.745 --> 15:47.412
Y'all want some ice cream?
Boon-boon/boonlinka: Yeah! Yeah!

15:47.414 --> 15:48.746
Daddy got you! We gonna go
get some ice cream! (chuckles)

15:48.748 --> 15:50.548
Boon-boon/boonlinka:
Yay! Ice cream!

15:50.550 --> 15:51.616
We'll do the ice cream thing.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.718
I'm telling you, it'll work.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.121
Isn't this ice cream
is the best one ever?
All right, it should be

15:57.123 --> 15:59.223
Up here
in the next couple blocks, man.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.625
Hey,
this hood don't look too bad.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.794
Look at that cat!
Fish: Boonie, just go in there,

16:02.796 --> 16:04.228
Deliver the message,
and get out, man.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.030
I'm gonna stay in the car
with the kids.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.467
Hey, you see that broad
up there in the street?

16:10.736 --> 16:11.736
What the (bleep)?!

16:11.738 --> 16:12.904
Boonie: Turn, man!

16:12.906 --> 16:13.905
Get the (bleep)
out of here, man!

16:13.907 --> 16:15.473
Fish: I'm trying to!

16:15.475 --> 16:18.142
Damn it! This bitch is crazy!
Boonie: What the hell?!

16:18.144 --> 16:20.511
Get off this street now!
Go, go, go, go!

16:20.513 --> 16:22.647
I'm going! I'm going!

16:22.649 --> 16:24.115
Man, what the (bleep) was that?

16:24.117 --> 16:26.084
Y'all all right?
(kids laughing)

16:26.086 --> 16:28.486
Hey, man, you got shot, dawg.
What?

16:28.488 --> 16:31.489
Jesus christ!
Hey, don't call jesus, man!
He gonna find out!

16:31.491 --> 16:34.125

If I had listened to jesus,

16:34.127 --> 16:35.460

16:55.849 --> 16:57.515
A video game!
And we got ice cream!

16:57.517 --> 16:59.617
Okay. Okay.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.387
Hey, well, look, I'm not okay.
Are you out

You know that?
See? What'd I tell you?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.031
What did I tell you?

17:13.033 --> 17:16.534
Hey, jesus, save me, man.
Save me. I got shot, man.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.870
Ow! Ow!

17:18.872 --> 17:21.906
That's what I told him, jee.
Ain't nothing but a fat wound.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.875
Man, I can't believe this, man.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.377
I go away all that time
and come back to this?

17:26.379 --> 17:29.247
Everybody I know

17:29.249 --> 17:30.882
Actin' like some idiots

17:30.884 --> 17:32.483
Look, man, I'm sorry, man,
but if y'all don't want

17:32.485 --> 17:34.218
To follow your boy,
it's cool, man.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.088
I can pack up and hit a new
spot, get some new followers,

17:37.090 --> 17:39.657
People who want to spread
the word of god, man.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.726
I'm out of here, man.
I'm headed to inglewood,

17:41.728 --> 17:43.394
Where folks appreciate your boy.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.696
Hey, jee, hey, I was just
driving the car, man.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.898
Ms. Tudi:
Don't worry about it, fish.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.266
He said that before.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.568
He ain't going nowhere.
He's jesus.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.638
Fish: You just goin',
forsakin' us like that?

17:55.874 --> 17:57.208
(knocking on side of van)

17:57.210 --> 17:59.944
Yo.

for a second?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.551
Look, man, I just...

18:06.553 --> 18:08.719
I just wanted to
say I'm sorry.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.588
I mean, I feel like lately
there's a lot of distance

18:10.590 --> 18:13.591
Between us, and I
know it's my fault.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.460
I just been doing
a lot of stuff lately

18:15.462 --> 18:17.695
That I ain't exactly
proud of, jee.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.063
But that's the only
way I'm surviving.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.398
And not just for me, man.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.867
I've been
holding down boonie and j.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.368
We thought you was gonna be
gone for a few days, man.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.070
You been gone for,
like, six months.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.139
I know, man.
It's my bad, dawg.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.975
It's just... (sighing)

18:30.977 --> 18:32.410
I was just reaching
so many brothers

18:32.412 --> 18:34.212
When I was in the hospital, man.

18:34.214 --> 18:37.115
I-I didn't even want to leave.
Well, what

18:37.117 --> 18:40.118
We needed you, too, man.
We still need you.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.620
Niggas love you, brah.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.422

18:51.464 --> 18:53.131
And if I'm gonna

18:53.133 --> 18:54.665
You gonna have
to straighten up, man.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.434

18:58.838 --> 19:02.507

homeboy head right, though.
