00:32.000 --> 00:33.980
>> John: HI THERE!

00:34.020 --> 00:34.980
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:35.020 --> 00:36.980
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

00:37.020 --> 00:38.980
THINK OF IT LIKE ANTARCTICA,

00:39.020 --> 00:40.880
IT'S A BLINDINGLY WHITE EXPANSE

00:41.000 --> 00:41.020
OCCASIONALLY INTERRUPTED

00:41.020 --> 00:42.980
BY A SINGLE WELL-DRESSED BIRD.

00:43.020 --> 00:43.980
AND IT HAS BEEN A GENUINELY

00:44.020 --> 00:45.980
EXTRAORDINARY WEEK FOR

00:46.020 --> 00:46.980
THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:47.020 --> 00:48.980
A SIGN OF JUST HOW CRAZY THINGS

00:49.020 --> 00:50.980
GOT IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TIME

00:51.020 --> 00:52.980
TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

00:53.020 --> 00:53.980
TRUMP REPORTEDLY PAID INCOME TAX

00:54.020 --> 00:54.980
RANGING FROM THE HIGH THREE

00:55.020 --> 00:56.980
FIGURES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO

00:57.020 --> 00:57.980
ZERO FIGURES FOR MULTIPLE YEARS,

00:58.020 --> 00:59.760
OR THE FACT THAT HIS WIFE WAS

01:00.000 --> 01:00.980
CAUGHT ON TAPE ESSENTIALLY

01:01.020 --> 01:01.980
SAYING "FUCK CHRISTMAS,"

01:02.020 --> 01:03.980
OR EVEN THIS MOMENT IN TUESDAY'S

01:04.020 --> 01:05.980
CATASTROPHIC DEBATE.

01:06.020 --> 01:06.980
>> THE LOW POINT OF THE DEBATE,

01:07.020 --> 01:08.980
AND POSSIBLY OF TRUMP'S ENTIRE

01:09.020 --> 01:09.980
CAMPAIGN, WAS WHEN THE PRESIDENT

01:10.020 --> 01:11.980
REFUSED TO CONDEMN

01:12.020 --> 01:13.980
WHITE SUPREMACISTS.

01:14.020 --> 01:14.980
>> ARE YOU WILLING TONIGHT TO

01:15.020 --> 01:17.000
CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND

01:17.000 --> 01:17.020
MILITIA GROUPS?

01:17.020 --> 01:18.980
>> SURE.

01:19.020 --> 01:20.980
>> AND TO SAY THAT THEY NEED

01:21.020 --> 01:22.980
TO STAND DOWN AND NOT ADD

01:23.020 --> 01:23.980
TO THE VIOLENCE IN A NUMBER OF

01:24.020 --> 01:24.980
THESE CITIES.

01:25.020 --> 01:25.980
>> I'M WILLING TO DO ANYTHING,

01:26.020 --> 01:26.980
I WANT TO SEE PEACE.

01:27.020 --> 01:27.980
>> WELL, THEN DO IT, SIR.

01:28.020 --> 01:29.980
>> DO IT, SAY IT.

01:30.020 --> 01:30.980
>> YOU WANT TO CALL THEM --

01:31.020 --> 01:32.000
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO CALL THEM?

01:32.000 --> 01:32.020
GIVE ME A NAME.

01:32.020 --> 01:32.980
GIVE ME A NAME.

01:33.020 --> 01:33.980
>> WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND

01:34.020 --> 01:34.980
RIGHT-WING MILITIAS.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.980
>> PROUD BOYS.

01:37.020 --> 01:37.980
>> PROUD BOYS, STAND BACK AND

01:38.020 --> 01:42.980
STAND BY.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.000
>> John: THAT DOES NOT GET

01:45.000 --> 01:45.960
ANY EASIER TO WATCH.

01:46.000 --> 01:46.020
BECAUSE THE QUESTION WAS

01:46.020 --> 01:48.000
"DO YOU CONDEMN

01:48.000 --> 01:48.020
WHITE SUPREMACISTS?"

01:48.020 --> 01:48.980
TO WHICH TRUMP RESPONDED BY

01:49.020 --> 01:49.980
ESSENTIALLY RALLYING THEM.

01:50.020 --> 01:51.940
AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANOTHER

01:52.000 --> 01:52.980
DEBATE QUESTION THAT EASY, OR AN

01:53.020 --> 01:53.980
ANSWER THAT HORRIBLE, ASIDE FROM

01:54.020 --> 01:54.980
MAYBE CHRIS WALLACE ASKING "HOW

01:55.020 --> 01:55.980
MANY FINGERS AM I HOLDING UP?"

01:56.020 --> 01:56.980
AND TRUMP RESPONDING, "HITLER

01:57.020 --> 01:58.980
HAD SOME REALLY GOOD IDEAS."

01:59.020 --> 02:00.980
BUT OBVIOUSLY, THE BIGGEST NEWS

02:01.020 --> 02:01.980
OF THE WEEK CAME EARLY FRIDAY

02:02.020 --> 02:03.980
MORNING, WHEN TRUMP REVEALED

02:04.020 --> 02:05.980
THAT HE AND MELANIA HAD TESTED

02:06.020 --> 02:07.980
POSITIVE FOR THE CORONAVIRUS.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.980
IT WAS NEWS THAT FELT BOTH

02:10.020 --> 02:10.980
SHOCKING AND UTTERLY INEVITABLE,

02:11.020 --> 02:12.980
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT JUST THREE

02:13.020 --> 02:16.980
DAYS EARLIER, HE'D STOOD ON

02:17.020 --> 02:17.980
A DEBATE STAGE AND, WHEN ASKED

02:18.020 --> 02:19.000
ABOUT WHETHER HE'D DOWNPLAYED

02:19.000 --> 02:19.020
THE EFFICACY OF MASKS,

02:19.020 --> 02:19.980
SAID THIS:

02:20.020 --> 02:20.980
>> I MEAN, I HAVE A MASK RIGHT

02:21.020 --> 02:21.980
HERE.

02:22.020 --> 02:22.980
I PUT A MASK ON, YOU KNOW, WHEN

02:23.020 --> 02:23.980
I THINK I NEED IT.

02:24.020 --> 02:24.980
WHEN NEEDED, I WEAR MASKS.

02:25.020 --> 02:25.980
>> OKAY.

02:26.020 --> 02:26.980
LET ME ASK --

02:27.020 --> 02:28.000
>> I DON'T -- I DON'T WEAR

02:28.000 --> 02:28.020
A MASK LIKE HIM.

02:28.020 --> 02:28.980
EVERY TIME YOU SEE HIM, HE'S GOT

02:29.020 --> 02:29.980
A MASK.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.980
HE COULD BE SPEAKING 200 FEET

02:32.020 --> 02:32.980
AWAY FROM HIM, HE SHOWS UP

02:33.020 --> 02:34.000
WITH THE BIGGEST MASK I'VE EVER

02:34.000 --> 02:34.020
SEEN.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.980
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:37.020 --> 02:37.980
BIDEN WEARS A MASK IN SITUATIONS

02:38.020 --> 02:40.000
WHERE IT'S DANGEROUS NOT TO.

02:41.000 --> 02:41.980
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT TRUMP

02:42.020 --> 02:42.980
WOULD BE LIKE STANDING NEXT

02:43.020 --> 02:43.980
TO A BEEKEEPER.

02:44.020 --> 02:45.980
"I DON'T WEAR A BEEKEEPER SUIT

02:46.020 --> 02:46.980
LIKE HIM.

02:47.020 --> 02:47.980
EVERY TIME YOU SEE HIM, HE'S

02:48.020 --> 02:48.980
WEARING A BEEKEEPER SUIT.

02:49.020 --> 02:49.980
NOT ME, BECAUSE I'M SMART AND

02:50.020 --> 02:50.980
STRONG.

02:51.020 --> 02:51.980
THIS WHOLE BEE THING IS A HOAX

02:52.020 --> 02:52.980
ANYWAY."

02:53.020 --> 02:54.980
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, THE PRESIDENT

02:55.020 --> 02:55.980
HAVING THE CORONAVIRUS IS

02:56.020 --> 02:57.980
A VERY BIG DEAL.

02:58.020 --> 02:59.980
AND WE'RE RECORDING THIS

03:00.020 --> 03:01.980
ON SATURDAY, SO WHO KNOWS WHAT'S

03:02.020 --> 03:03.980
HAPPENED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.980
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT SO FAR,

03:06.020 --> 03:06.980
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS HANDLED

03:07.020 --> 03:08.980
THE SITUATION TERRIBLY.

03:09.020 --> 03:09.980
FIRST, THE NEWS ONLY CAME OUT

03:10.020 --> 03:11.980
AFTER REPORTERS DISCOVERED THAT

03:12.020 --> 03:12.980
ONE OF TRUMP'S CLOSEST AIDES,

03:13.020 --> 03:14.980
HOPE HICKS, WHO'D TRAVELED WITH

03:15.020 --> 03:15.980
TRUMP TO THE DEBATE, HAD TESTED

03:16.020 --> 03:16.980
POSITIVE.

03:17.020 --> 03:18.980
PROMPTING THE OBVIOUS QUESTION

03:19.020 --> 03:19.980
OF WHEN THE PRESIDENT LEARNED

03:20.020 --> 03:22.000
HE'D BEEN EXPOSED, AND WHAT HE'D

03:22.000 --> 03:22.020
DONE ABOUT IT, AND THE ANSWERS

03:22.020 --> 03:24.980
THERE WEREN'T GREAT.

03:25.020 --> 03:27.980
>> THE WHITE HOUSE KNEW ON

03:28.020 --> 03:28.980
THURSDAY MORNING THAT HOPE HICKS

03:29.020 --> 03:32.980
HAD SYMPTOMS OF CORONAVIRUS, BUT

03:33.020 --> 03:33.980
DESPITE THAT, THE PRESIDENT WENT

03:34.020 --> 03:34.980
AHEAD WITH PLANS TO TRAVEL

03:35.020 --> 03:35.980
TO NEW JERSEY FOR A FUNDRAISER

03:36.020 --> 03:36.980
ANYWAY.

03:37.020 --> 03:37.980
>> IT WAS DEEMED SAFE FOR

03:38.020 --> 03:40.980
THE PRESIDENT TO GO.

03:41.020 --> 03:41.980
HE SOCIALLY DISTANCED, IT WAS AN

03:42.020 --> 03:43.940
OUTDOOR EVENT, AND IT WAS DEEMED

03:44.000 --> 03:45.980
SAFE BY WHITE HOUSE OPERATIONS.

03:46.020 --> 03:46.980
>> John: OKAY, NORMALLY I'D

03:47.020 --> 03:47.980
CRITICIZE THE WHITE HOUSE

03:48.020 --> 03:48.980
OPERATIONS TEAM FOR EITHER

03:49.020 --> 03:50.980
HAVING NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT IS

03:51.020 --> 03:51.980
AND ISN'T SAFE OR JUST NOT

03:52.020 --> 03:52.980
CARING, BUT GIVEN THAT THERE'S

03:53.020 --> 03:54.980
A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE THAT MOST

03:55.020 --> 03:56.980
OF THEM HAVE COVID NOW,

03:57.020 --> 03:57.980
I GUESS I'LL JUST SAY,

03:58.020 --> 03:59.980
"FEEL BETTER, GUYS."

04:00.020 --> 04:00.980
AND SO MANY OF THE DECISIONS

04:01.020 --> 04:01.980
TRUMP AND THOSE AROUND HIM MADE

04:02.020 --> 04:03.980
THIS WEEK NOW LOOK APPALLING

04:04.020 --> 04:05.980
IN HINDSIGHT -- FROM HIS FAMILY

04:06.020 --> 04:06.980
REFUSING TO WEAR MASKS

04:07.020 --> 04:08.980
AT TUESDAY'S DEBATE, TO FAILING

04:09.020 --> 04:09.980
TO NOTIFY ANYONE ON THE BIDEN

04:10.020 --> 04:10.980
TEAM THAT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN

04:11.020 --> 04:12.980
EXPOSED, TO THE FACT THAT

04:13.020 --> 04:13.980
THE FUNDRAISER HE ATTENDED

04:14.020 --> 04:15.700
JUST BEFORE TESTING POSITIVE

04:16.000 --> 04:17.980
WAS A FUCKING BUFFET!

04:18.020 --> 04:19.980
BUT MAYBE THE EVENT THAT LOOKS

04:20.020 --> 04:20.980
THE WORST TOOK PLACE LAST

04:21.020 --> 04:21.980
WEEKEND.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.980
>> THERE IS ALSO SOME FOCUS

04:24.020 --> 04:24.980
ON THIS EVENT THAT WAS HELD

04:25.020 --> 04:26.980
AT THE WHITE HOUSE LAST SATURDAY

04:27.020 --> 04:27.980
WHEN THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED HIS

04:28.020 --> 04:28.980
PICK FOR THE SUPREME COURT,

04:29.020 --> 04:29.980
AMY CONEY BARRETT.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.980
WE KNOW THAT UTAH SENATOR

04:32.020 --> 04:32.980
MIKE LEE, WHO WAS AT THAT EVENT,

04:33.020 --> 04:34.980
THE PRESIDENT OF NOTRE DAME, WHO

04:35.020 --> 04:35.980
WAS ALSO AT THAT EVENT, HAVE

04:36.020 --> 04:36.980
BOTH TESTED POSITIVE NOW FOR

04:37.020 --> 04:37.980
THE CORONAVIRUS.

04:38.020 --> 04:39.980
OBVIOUSLY, WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS

04:40.020 --> 04:41.980
WERE AT THAT EVENT, AND SO THERE

04:42.020 --> 04:42.980
IS THE POTENTIAL THAT ALL OF

04:43.020 --> 04:43.980
THIS BEGAN THERE.

04:44.020 --> 04:45.980
>> John: YES, MUCH LIKE

04:46.020 --> 04:46.980
THE SLEW OF UTTERLY HORRIFYING

04:47.020 --> 04:48.980
SUPREME COURT RULINGS OVER

04:49.020 --> 04:49.980
THE NEXT FEW DECADES, IT SEEMS

04:50.020 --> 04:50.980
WE MAY LOOK BACK ON LAST

04:51.020 --> 04:52.980
SATURDAY'S WHITE HOUSE EVENT AND

04:53.020 --> 04:55.980
SAY, "ALL OF THIS BEGAN THERE."

04:56.020 --> 04:57.980
AND THERE IS SOMETHING UTTERLY

04:58.020 --> 04:58.980
INFURIATING ABOUT WATCHING THEM

04:59.020 --> 04:59.980
HUGGING EACH OTHER WHEN MANY IN

05:00.020 --> 05:01.980
THIS COUNTRY HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR

05:02.020 --> 05:02.980
FAMILIES FOR MONTHS OR HAVE DIED

05:03.020 --> 05:05.980
ALONE IN A HOSPITAL!

05:06.020 --> 05:06.980
AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY'RE

05:07.020 --> 05:07.980
PUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK --

05:08.020 --> 05:08.980
MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT'S THAT

05:09.020 --> 05:09.980
THEY'RE RISKING INFECTING

05:10.020 --> 05:10.980
OTHERS.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.980
THE THING ABOUT A HIGHLY

05:13.020 --> 05:14.980
CONTAGIOUS VIRUS IS, YOUR

05:15.020 --> 05:15.980
RECKLESSNESS COULD END UP

05:16.020 --> 05:16.980
KILLING SOMEONE YOU NEVER MEET.

05:17.020 --> 05:18.980
AND THEY'RE STILL DOING IT!

05:19.020 --> 05:20.980
BILL BARR, WHO WAS AT THAT EVENT

05:21.020 --> 05:22.980
AND MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED,

05:23.020 --> 05:23.980
IS CHOOSING NOT TO QUARANTINE

05:24.020 --> 05:24.980
HIMSELF.

05:25.020 --> 05:25.980
MEANWHILE, FOUR REPUBLICANS WHO

05:26.020 --> 05:27.980
TRAVELED WITH TRUMP THIS WEEK

05:28.020 --> 05:29.980
NOT ONLY DIDN'T QUARANTINE,

05:30.020 --> 05:30.980
THEY SHOWED UP TO THE HOUSE

05:31.020 --> 05:32.980
TO VOTE IN PERSON, THEN THREE

05:33.020 --> 05:33.980
OF THEM TOOK A DELTA FLIGHT

05:34.020 --> 05:35.980
HOME!

05:36.020 --> 05:37.980
THE FRUSTRATING THING IS,

05:38.020 --> 05:38.980
REPUBLICANS SEEM TO BE HANDLING

05:39.020 --> 05:40.980
THIS OUTBREAK THE WAY THEY'VE

05:41.020 --> 05:41.980
HANDLED THE WHOLE PANDEMIC, WITH

05:42.020 --> 05:42.980
A MIXTURE OF DENIALISM, HUBRIS,

05:43.020 --> 05:44.980
AND TREATING IT MORE AS

05:45.020 --> 05:45.980
A P.R CRISIS THAN ONE OF

05:46.020 --> 05:47.980
PUBLIC HEALTH, WHICH HAS HAD

05:48.020 --> 05:49.980
HUGE KNOCK-ON EFFECTS.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.980
AND THERE MIGHT BE NO BETTER

05:52.020 --> 05:52.980
EXAMPLE OF THIS THAN THIS TRUMP

05:53.020 --> 05:53.980
SUPPORTER -- OUTSIDE THE

05:54.020 --> 05:55.980
HOSPITAL TRUMP WAS RUSHED TO ON

05:56.020 --> 05:56.980
FRIDAY -- EXPLAINING WHY HE

05:57.020 --> 05:59.980
WASN'T WEARING A MASK.

06:00.020 --> 06:03.000
>> WELL, I'M YOUNG, AND I'M NOT

06:04.000 --> 06:05.980
AT RISK FOR COVID, SO WITH THE

06:06.020 --> 06:07.980
SURVIVAL RATES THAT WE'VE SEEN,

06:08.020 --> 06:09.980
IT'S FRANKLY HYSTERIA WHAT WE'RE

06:10.020 --> 06:12.980
SEEING WITH COVID, SO.

06:13.020 --> 06:15.000
>> ARE YOU EVER CONCERNED YOU

06:16.000 --> 06:16.020
COULD POSSIBLY BE ASYMPTOMATIC

06:16.020 --> 06:18.980
AND PASS IT TO SOMEONE ELSE?

06:19.020 --> 06:21.980
>> YES, I DO HAVE THOSE

06:22.020 --> 06:22.980
CONCERNS, BUT I DON'T BUY INTO

06:23.020 --> 06:24.980
THE FEARMONGERING.

06:25.020 --> 06:25.980
>> John: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU

06:26.020 --> 06:27.980
TALKING ABOUT?

06:28.020 --> 06:28.980
YOU'RE ONLY THERE BECAUSE THE

06:29.020 --> 06:29.980
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

06:30.020 --> 06:31.980
IS IN THE BUILDING BEHIND YOU

06:32.020 --> 06:33.980
WITH A PRETTY BAD CASE OF

06:34.020 --> 06:34.980
FEARMONGERING.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.980
AND AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO SHOUT

06:37.020 --> 06:37.980
AT THAT GUY, YOU HAVE TO

06:38.020 --> 06:38.980
REMEMBER THAT THIS

06:39.020 --> 06:39.980
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN

06:40.020 --> 06:40.980
DOWNPLAYING THE VIRUS SO MUCH

06:41.020 --> 06:44.980
AND FOR SO LONG, THAT FOR

06:45.020 --> 06:45.980
TRUMP'S DIE-HARD SUPPORTERS, ANY

06:46.020 --> 06:47.980

12:16.020 --> 12:16.980
REVOLVERS AND ARMBANDS AT

12:17.020 --> 12:18.980
A POLLING SITE IS NEVER

12:19.020 --> 12:20.980
A GREAT LOOK, CONSIDERING THAT

12:21.020 --> 12:21.980
THE LITERAL DEFINITION OF AN

12:22.020 --> 12:23.980

12:25.020 --> 12:26.980
THE SAFETY OF THE POLLS.

12:27.020 --> 12:29.980
THAT INCIDENT CAUSED SUCH

12:30.020 --> 12:30.980
AN OUTCRY, THE DEMOCRATS SUED,

12:31.020 --> 12:31.980
AND THE RNC ENTERED INTO A

12:36.020 --> 12:36.980

12:37.020 --> 12:40.980

12:41.020 --> 12:43.000

12:45.020 --> 12:46.980
IT'S REGAIN A NATION'S TRUST.

12:47.020 --> 12:48.980

12:49.020 --> 12:50.980

12:53.020 --> 12:53.980

13:05.020 --> 13:06.980
VOTERS, WHO ALREADY FACE

13:07.020 --> 13:07.980
SUBSTANTIALLY LONGER WAIT TIMES

13:08.020 --> 13:10.000
THAN WHITE VOTERS.

13:11.000 --> 13:11.980
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE IMPACT

13:12.020 --> 13:12.980
OF FEWER POLLING PLACES IN THIS

13:13.020 --> 13:13.980
YEAR'S PRIMARIES, BECAUSE WATCH

13:14.020 --> 13:15.980
THIS GEORGIA VOTER SHOW YOU HOW

13:16.020 --> 13:19.980
LONG HIS LINE WAS.

13:20.020 --> 13:22.980
>> SEVEN HOURS, 45 MINUTES, AND

13:23.020 --> 13:25.980
13 SECONDS, IT TOOK FOR ME TO

13:26.020 --> 13:28.980
VOTE IN FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.980
AS SOON AS I SAW THE LINE,

13:31.020 --> 13:32.980
I HIT THE STOPWATCH ON MY PHONE.

13:33.020 --> 13:36.980
I SPENT THE FIRST COUPLE HOURS

13:37.020 --> 13:37.980
LISTENING TO THE NEW

13:38.020 --> 13:38.980
RUN THE JEWELS ALBUM.

13:39.020 --> 13:39.980
AND THEN I ENDED UP LISTENING

13:40.020 --> 13:42.980
TO THE ENTIRE DISCOGRAPHY.

13:43.020 --> 13:43.980
AND THEN I STARTED WATCHING

13:44.020 --> 13:44.980
SEASON 8 OF

13:45.020 --> 13:48.980
"CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM."

13:49.020 --> 13:50.100
THAT'S FIVE HOURS.

13:51.000 --> 13:51.020
IT WAS 1:00 IN THE MORNING AND

13:51.020 --> 13:52.980
SOMEBODY WAS LIKE, "HEY, Y'ALL

13:53.020 --> 13:53.980
REMEMBER WE CAME TO VOTE

13:54.020 --> 13:55.100
YESTERDAY, RIGHT?"

13:56.000 --> 13:56.980
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

13:57.020 --> 13:58.980
CAN YOU IMAGINE WATCHING

13:59.020 --> 13:59.980
FIVE HOURS OF STREAMING VIDEO

14:00.020 --> 14:00.980
ON YOUR PHONE WHILE STANDING

14:01.020 --> 14:01.980
IN LINE TO VOTE?

14:02.020 --> 14:03.980
YOU CAN'T?

14:04.020 --> 14:04.980
WHAT IF EACH VIDEO WAS LESS THAN

14:05.020 --> 14:05.980
TEN MINUTES AT A TIME, WITH

14:06.020 --> 14:06.980
COMMERCIALS?

14:07.020 --> 14:07.980
STILL NO?

14:08.020 --> 14:08.980
HOW ABOUT IF YOU COULD WATCH

14:09.020 --> 14:09.980
THE SHOW VERTICALLY OR

14:10.020 --> 14:10.980
HORIZONTALLY?

14:11.020 --> 14:11.980
NO AGAIN?

14:12.020 --> 14:12.980
OKAY, SORRY, QUIBI, I GUESS IT'S

14:13.020 --> 14:17.980
OFFICIAL: YOU'RE A BAD IDEA.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.980
>> BAD IDEA!

14:21.020 --> 14:23.000
>> John: I HATE TO BREAK THIS TO

14:23.000 --> 14:23.020
YOU $2 BILLION IN.

14:23.020 --> 14:23.980
YOU KNOW WHAT -- WHO KNOWS?

14:24.020 --> 14:24.980
MAYBE ONE OF YOUR SHOWS WILL

14:25.020 --> 14:26.000
BE A HIT, LIKE THE ONE ABOUT

14:26.000 --> 14:26.960
FLIPPING HOUSES WHERE GRISLY

14:27.000 --> 14:27.020
MURDERS TOOK PLACE.

14:27.020 --> 14:27.980
REALLY?

14:28.020 --> 14:28.980
AW, COME ON.

14:29.020 --> 14:29.980
STRANGER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.

14:30.020 --> 14:34.000
AFTER ALL, HBO MAX STILL EXISTS,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
AND THEY CHARGE $14.9 --

14:38.000 --> 14:38.020
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

14:38.020 --> 14:41.980
YOU ARE COMPLETELY RIGHT.

14:42.020 --> 14:42.980
I CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

14:43.020 --> 14:43.980
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THIS

14:44.020 --> 14:44.980
TOGETHER -- THE LONG LINES,

14:45.020 --> 14:45.980
THE POSSIBILITY OF HARASSMENT,

14:46.020 --> 14:46.980
AND THE LOOMING THREAT OF

14:47.020 --> 14:47.980
THE PANDEMIC -- IT'S NO WONDER

14:48.020 --> 14:48.980
THAT AROUND 40% OF AMERICANS SAY

14:49.020 --> 14:49.980
THEY'LL BE VOTING BY MAIL THIS

14:50.020 --> 14:50.980
YEAR.

14:51.020 --> 14:51.980
BUT THAT HAS ACTUALLY OPENED UP

14:52.020 --> 14:53.980
A WHOLE NEW FRONT IN

14:54.020 --> 14:54.980
REPUBLICANS' WAR ON

14:55.020 --> 14:55.980
DEMOCRATIC VOTES.

14:56.020 --> 14:56.980
AND TO UNDERSTAND WHY, IT HELPS

14:57.020 --> 14:57.980
TO UNDERSTAND ONE KEY STATISTIC:

14:58.020 --> 14:59.980
THE MAJORITY OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS

15:00.020 --> 15:01.980
SAY THEY'LL VOTE IN PERSON ON

15:02.020 --> 15:02.980
ELECTION DAY, WHILE THE MAJORITY

15:03.020 --> 15:04.980
OF BIDEN SUPPORTERS SAY THEY'LL

15:05.020 --> 15:07.980
VOTE BY MAIL.

15:08.020 --> 15:08.980
SO IT'S CLEARLY VERY MUCH IN

15:09.020 --> 15:10.980
TRUMP'S INTEREST TO TRY AND

15:11.020 --> 15:11.980
DISCREDIT VOTING BY MAIL,

15:12.020 --> 15:13.980
CLAIMING IT'S RIFE WITH FRAUD,

15:14.020 --> 15:14.980
DESPITE THE FACT -- AS STUDIES

15:15.020 --> 15:16.980
AND COURT CASES HAVE REPEATEDLY

15:17.020 --> 15:18.980
SHOWN -- IT ISN'T.

15:19.020 --> 15:20.980
AND IT'S NOT JUST TRUMP CLAIMING

15:21.020 --> 15:21.980
THEY'RE ILLEGITIMATE, EVEN

15:22.020 --> 15:23.940
BILL BARR, HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
HAS JOINED IN, SAYING SHIT LIKE

15:25.000 --> 15:31.980
THIS.

15:32.020 --> 15:33.980
>> WHEN -- WHEN GOVERNMENT

15:34.020 --> 15:35.980
GOVERNMENTS START ADOPTING THESE

15:36.020 --> 15:36.980
PRACTICES LIKE MAIL-IN BALLOTS

15:37.020 --> 15:38.980
THAT OPEN THE FLOODGATES OF

15:39.020 --> 15:39.980
POTENTIAL FRAUD, THEN PEOPLE'S

15:40.020 --> 15:40.980
CONFIDENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF THE

15:41.020 --> 15:42.980
ELECTION IS GONNA BE UNDERMINED.

15:43.020 --> 15:44.980
AND THAT COULD TAKE THE COUNTRY

15:45.020 --> 15:45.980
TO A VERY DARK PLACE IF WE LOSE

15:46.020 --> 15:47.980
CONFIDENCE IN THE OUTCOMES OF

15:48.020 --> 15:48.980
OUR ELECTIONS.

15:49.020 --> 15:49.980
>> John: YEAH, BUT YOU'RE

15:50.020 --> 15:50.980
THE ONE UNDERMINING

15:51.020 --> 15:51.980
OUR CONFIDENCE!

15:52.020 --> 15:53.980
YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT THERE!

15:54.020 --> 15:54.980
AND AS FOR THE NOTION THAT

15:55.020 --> 15:56.980
"THIS COULD TAKE THE COUNTRY

15:57.020 --> 15:57.980
TO A DARK PLACE?"

15:58.020 --> 15:59.980
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

16:00.020 --> 16:00.980
BUT EVERYTHING WITHIN DRIVING

16:01.020 --> 16:01.980
DISTANCE OF DISNEYLAND IS

16:02.020 --> 16:02.980
COVERED IN SMOKE, THERE'S

16:03.020 --> 16:04.980
A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT JUST

16:05.020 --> 16:05.980
INFECTED THE PRESIDENT, AND

16:06.020 --> 16:06.980
YOU'RE ON TELEVISION IN STUPID

16:07.020 --> 16:08.980
WOODY ALLEN GLASSES CALLING

16:09.020 --> 16:09.980
THE LEGITIMACY OF OUR DEMOCRACY

16:10.020 --> 16:12.000
INTO QUESTION.

16:13.000 --> 16:13.980
WE'RE IN THAT VERY DARK PLACE

16:14.020 --> 16:15.980
ALREADY, BILLIAM.

16:16.020 --> 16:16.980
TRUMP HIMSELF HAS GONE OUT OF

16:17.020 --> 16:18.980
HIS WAY TO CLAIM THAT ALL MANNER

16:19.020 --> 16:19.980
OF BALLOT FRAUD IS ALREADY

16:20.020 --> 16:20.980
TAKING PLACE.

16:21.020 --> 16:22.980
HE EVEN RATTLED OFF EXAMPLES

16:23.020 --> 16:23.980
DURING TUESDAY'S DEBATE.

16:24.020 --> 16:24.980
>> THEY'RE SENDING MILLIONS OF

16:25.020 --> 16:26.980
BALLOTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

16:27.020 --> 16:27.980
THERE'S FRAUD.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.980
THEY FOUND THEM IN CREEKS.

16:31.020 --> 16:31.980
THEY FOUND SOME, JUST HAPPENED

16:32.020 --> 16:32.980
TO HAVE THE NAME "TRUMP" JUST

16:33.020 --> 16:35.000
THE OTHER DAY IN A WASTEPAPER

16:35.000 --> 16:35.020
BASKET.

16:35.020 --> 16:35.980
THEY'RE BEING SENT ALL OVER

16:36.020 --> 16:36.980
THE PLACE.

16:37.020 --> 16:39.000
THEY SENT TWO IN A DEMOCRAT

16:39.000 --> 16:39.020
AREA.

16:39.020 --> 16:39.980
THEY SENT OUT A THOUSAND

16:40.020 --> 16:40.980
BALLOTS.

16:41.020 --> 16:42.980
EVERYBODY GOT TWO BALLOTS.

16:43.020 --> 16:43.980
THIS IS GOING TO BE A FRAUD LIKE

16:44.020 --> 16:45.980
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.580
>> John: OKAY, I KNOW THAT

16:48.000 --> 16:48.980
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT, BUT -- AS

16:49.020 --> 16:49.980
YOU'VE PROBABLY GUESSED -- THAT

16:50.020 --> 16:51.980
WAS A 12-COURSE TASTING MENU

16:52.020 --> 16:52.980
OF HORSESHIT.

16:53.020 --> 16:53.980
BECAUSE HE IS WILDLY

16:54.020 --> 16:55.700
MISREPRESENTING EVERY SINGLE

16:56.000 --> 16:57.980
ONE OF THOSE CASES.

16:58.020 --> 16:58.980
FIRST, ON THE BALLOTS IN THE

16:59.020 --> 16:59.980
CREEK EXAMPLE, HE SEEMS TO

17:00.020 --> 17:01.980
BE REFERRING TO REPORTS OF

17:02.020 --> 17:02.980
A FEW ABSENTEE BALLOTS

17:03.020 --> 17:03.980
IN WISCONSIN BEING FOUND

17:04.020 --> 17:04.980
IN TRAYS OF MAIL THAT WERE FOUND

17:05.020 --> 17:06.980
IN A DITCH.

17:07.020 --> 17:07.980
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW, THE TRAYS

17:08.020 --> 17:10.980
WERE FULL OF ALL SORTS OF MAIL,

17:11.020 --> 17:11.980
AND STATE ELECTION OFFICIALS

17:12.020 --> 17:12.980
LATER CLARIFIED THEY ACTUALLY

17:13.020 --> 17:14.820
"DID NOT INCLUDE ANY WISCONSIN

17:15.000 --> 17:16.980
BALLOTS" WHATSOEVER.

17:17.020 --> 17:18.980
AS FOR THE WASTEPAPER BASKET

17:19.020 --> 17:20.980
EXAMPLE, THAT WAS AN INCIDENT

17:21.020 --> 17:21.980
WHERE A TEMP WORKER, WHO'D ONLY

17:22.020 --> 17:22.980
WORKED AT THE COUNTY ELECTION

17:23.020 --> 17:24.980
OFFICE FOR THREE DAYS,

17:25.020 --> 17:25.980
MISTAKENLY DISCARDED NINE

17:26.020 --> 17:27.980
BALLOTS, AND WHEN HIS BOSSES

17:28.020 --> 17:28.980
REALIZED WHAT HE'D DONE,

17:29.020 --> 17:30.980
THEY IMMEDIATELY REPORTED IT

17:31.020 --> 17:31.980
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE LOCAL,

17:32.020 --> 17:33.980
STATE, AND FEDERAL LEVEL.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.980
AND JUST SPARE A QUICK THOUGHT

17:36.020 --> 17:37.980
FOR THAT TEMP.

17:38.020 --> 17:38.980
IMAGINE IF SOME STUPID MISTAKE

17:39.020 --> 17:40.980
YOU MADE AT WORK ENDED UP BEING

17:41.020 --> 17:41.980
HELD UP AS EVIDENCE OF

17:42.020 --> 17:42.980
A LEFT-WING CONSPIRACY AGAINST

17:43.020 --> 17:44.980
THE PRESIDENT.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.980
IMAGINE BUYING THE WRONG K-CUPS

17:48.020 --> 17:48.980
FOR THE BREAK-ROOM AND NEXT

17:49.020 --> 17:51.980
THING YOU KNOW, TUCKER CARLSON

17:52.020 --> 17:54.000
IS ON TV SCREAMING ABOUT HOW

17:54.000 --> 17:54.020
THE RADICAL LEFT IS

17:54.020 --> 17:55.980
DECAFFEINATING THE SUBURBS.

17:56.020 --> 17:56.980
AND FINALLY, AS FOR THOSE

17:57.020 --> 17:57.980
THOUSAND EXTRA BALLOTS HE

17:58.020 --> 17:59.880
MENTIONED -- THAT WAS A FUCK UP

18:00.000 --> 18:00.980
WHERE SOME VOTERS IN

18:01.020 --> 18:01.980
FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA,

18:02.020 --> 18:02.980
WERE SENT TWO MAIL-IN BALLOTS

18:03.020 --> 18:04.980
BY MISTAKE.

18:05.020 --> 18:07.980
WHICH SOUNDS BAD, BUT THE KEY

18:08.020 --> 18:09.980
THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT

18:10.020 --> 18:10.980
BECAUSE BALLOTS ARE MATCHED TO

18:11.020 --> 18:12.760
INDIVIDUAL VOTERS, THE SYSTEM

18:13.000 --> 18:13.980
IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT PEOPLE

18:14.020 --> 18:15.980
VOTING TWICE.

18:16.020 --> 18:17.980
YOU MAY HAVE TWO BALLOTS,

18:18.020 --> 18:18.980
BUT YOU CAN ONLY CAST ONE.

18:19.020 --> 18:21.980
AND LOOK, MISTAKES ARE GOING TO

18:22.020 --> 18:22.980
HAPPEN IN AN ELECTION WITH OVER

18:23.020 --> 18:23.980
100 MILLION BALLOTS.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.980
THEY SHOULDN'T, BUT THEY WILL.

18:27.020 --> 18:28.980
AND WHEN THEY DO, WE SHOULD MOVE

18:29.020 --> 18:30.980
FAST TO CORRECT THEM.

18:31.020 --> 18:32.980
BUT NONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES TRUMP

18:33.020 --> 18:33.980
CITED, ALL OF WHICH HAVE LIT UP

18:34.020 --> 18:34.980
RIGHT-WING MEDIA, APPEAR TO

18:35.020 --> 18:35.980
BE PART OF ANY SCHEME

18:36.020 --> 18:36.980
TO STEAL VOTES.

18:37.020 --> 18:40.980
AND IF THEY ARE, THE SCHEME

18:41.020 --> 18:41.980
SEEMS TO BE HORRIBLY

18:42.020 --> 18:42.980
COORDINATED,

18:43.020 --> 18:43.980
TOTALLY NONSENSICAL, AND

18:44.020 --> 18:44.980
EXTREMELY DUMB.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.980
SO THE FACT IS THAT FEARS OVER

18:47.020 --> 18:47.980
MAIL-IN BALLOT FRAUD HAVE BEEN

18:48.020 --> 18:48.980
WILDLY OVERBLOWN.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.980
AND TO THE EXTENT THERE IS ANY

18:51.020 --> 18:52.980
DANGER WITH THEM, IT'S ACTUALLY

18:53.020 --> 18:56.980
A FAR MORE MUNDANE ONE, AND

18:57.020 --> 18:59.000
THAT'S THAT YOU COULD END UP

18:59.000 --> 18:59.020
HAVING YOUR BALLOT REJECTED FOR

18:59.020 --> 18:59.980
TECHNICAL REASONS.

19:00.020 --> 19:01.980
>> IN THE 2020 PRIMARIES,

19:02.020 --> 19:03.980
MORE THAN 550,000 BALLOTS

19:04.020 --> 19:05.980
WERE REJECTED IN 30 STATES

19:06.020 --> 19:06.980
DUE TO MISSING SIGNATURES,

19:07.020 --> 19:08.880
MISSED DEADLINES, OR SIGNATURES

19:09.000 --> 19:09.980
THAT COULD NOT BE VERIFIED.

19:10.020 --> 19:11.980
>> John: THINK ABOUT THAT --

19:12.020 --> 19:13.640
OVER HALF A MILLION BALLOTS

19:14.000 --> 19:14.980
WERE REJECTED IN THE PRIMARIES!

19:15.020 --> 19:15.980
THAT'S PRACTICALLY AN ENTIRE

19:16.020 --> 19:16.980
WYOMING DISAPPEARING

19:17.020 --> 19:20.980
INTO THIN AIR.

19:21.020 --> 19:21.980
THAT IS REALLY BAD, UNLESS IT'S

19:22.020 --> 19:23.980
THE ACTUAL WYOMING DISAPPEARING,

19:24.020 --> 19:24.980
IN WHICH CASE, IT MIGHT BE FOR

19:25.020 --> 19:25.980
THE BEST.

19:26.020 --> 19:26.980
IT'S A SEMI-ARID SANDBOX FILLED

19:27.020 --> 19:28.980
WITH FLUFFY COWS AND NOTHING.

19:29.020 --> 19:30.980
THE MOST FAMOUS PART OF WYOMING

19:31.020 --> 19:31.980
IS THE STATE TRYING TO SWALLOW

19:32.020 --> 19:33.980
ITSELF UP, AND THE SECOND MOST

19:34.020 --> 19:34.980
FAMOUS PART IS IT SPITTING

19:35.020 --> 19:35.980
ITSELF OUT AGAIN.

19:36.020 --> 19:37.980
IT'S CLEAR THAT EVEN YOU DON'T

19:38.020 --> 19:38.980
LIKE YOU, WYOMING, AND IT'S

19:39.020 --> 19:39.980
GETTING HARD FOR THE REST OF US

19:40.020 --> 19:40.980
TO WATCH.

19:41.020 --> 19:42.980
AND TO BE FAIR TO VOTERS,

19:43.020 --> 19:44.340
BALLOTS CAN BE TRICKY.

19:45.000 --> 19:45.980
SOME STATES HAVE SECRECY

19:46.020 --> 19:47.980
ENVELOPES, WHICH YOU DON'T SIGN,

19:48.020 --> 19:48.980
WHICH YOU THEN HAVE TO PUT

19:49.020 --> 19:49.980
INSIDE A DECLARATION ENVELOPE,

19:50.020 --> 19:52.980
WHICH YOU DO.

19:53.020 --> 19:55.000
IT CAN BE CONFUSING, SO MAKE

19:55.000 --> 19:55.960
SURE YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS

19:56.000 --> 19:56.980
CAREFULLY.

19:57.020 --> 19:57.980
AND IT'S ALSO SURPRISINGLY

19:58.020 --> 19:58.980
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT

19:59.020 --> 20:00.980
THE SIGNATURE THAT YOU'RE USING.

20:01.020 --> 20:02.980
BECAUSE THEY MATCH THEM AGAINST

20:03.020 --> 20:03.980
THE ONE THEY HAVE ON RECORD FOR

20:04.020 --> 20:04.980
YOU, EITHER FROM WHEN YOU

20:05.020 --> 20:06.980
REGISTERED TO VOTE, OR THE ONE

20:07.020 --> 20:07.980
YOU HAVE ON FILE AT THE DMV.

20:08.020 --> 20:09.980
AND REPLICATING YOUR OWN

20:10.020 --> 20:11.980
SIGNATURE CAN BE MORE DIFFICULT

20:12.020 --> 20:12.980
THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT, AS THIS

20:13.020 --> 20:14.980
HANDWRITING EXPERT EXPLAINS.

20:15.020 --> 20:16.980
>> ORSINI SAYS NO TWO SIGNATURES

20:17.020 --> 20:17.980
ARE IDENTICAL AND VARY OVER

20:18.020 --> 20:19.980
TIME.

20:20.020 --> 20:20.980
>> HAND SIZE AND AGE AND

20:21.020 --> 20:22.980
ILLNESS, MEDICATION.

20:23.020 --> 20:23.980
THE WRITING POSITION

20:24.020 --> 20:24.980
THEY WERE IN.

20:25.020 --> 20:25.980
WERE THEY DEPRESSED?

20:26.020 --> 20:27.980
ALL OF THOSE KIND OF FACTORS

20:28.020 --> 20:28.980
COME INTO PLAY.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.980
>> LOOK AT THESE ACTUAL

20:31.020 --> 20:31.980
SIGNATURES FROM FORMER PRESIDENT

20:32.020 --> 20:32.980
RICHARD NIXON OVER A SIX-YEAR

20:33.020 --> 20:34.980
PERIOD.

20:35.020 --> 20:36.980
>> IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE

20:37.020 --> 20:37.980
SAME PERSON.

20:38.020 --> 20:39.000
>> EXACTLY.

20:39.000 --> 20:39.020
BUT YET IT IS.

20:39.020 --> 20:39.980
IT'S THE SAME SIGNATURE.

20:40.020 --> 20:40.980
>> John: YEAH, THE TRUTH IS,

20:41.020 --> 20:41.980
OUR SIGNATURES CHANGE OVER TIME.

20:42.020 --> 20:43.980
AND SOMETIMES, OVER THE COURSE

20:44.020 --> 20:45.980
OF A SINGLE DAY, BECAUSE LET'S

20:46.020 --> 20:47.980
BE HONEST, WE ALL HAVE AT LEAST

20:48.020 --> 20:49.980
TWO SIGNATURES -- THE REAL ONE,

20:50.020 --> 20:50.980
AND YOUR COFFEE SHOP SIGNATURE,

20:51.020 --> 20:52.980
WHICH IS USUALLY JUST A LINE

20:53.020 --> 20:53.980
AND, DEPENDING ON YOUR MOOD,

20:54.020 --> 20:56.980
A COUPLE OF LOOP-DE-LOOPS.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.000
LOOK, YOU'RE GETTING A MUFFIN,

20:58.000 --> 20:58.020
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,

20:58.020 --> 20:58.980
CALLIGRAPH THE iPAD?

20:59.020 --> 20:59.980
OF COURSE NOT.

21:00.020 --> 21:00.980
IT'S YOUR POINTER FINGER,

21:01.020 --> 21:01.980
IT'S NOT YOUR ART FINGER.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.980
IT'S FOR POINTING.

21:04.020 --> 21:04.980
AND IN THEORY, SOME STATES

21:05.020 --> 21:05.980
ARE SUPPOSED TO LET YOU KNOW

21:06.020 --> 21:06.980
IF YOUR BALLOT WAS DISQUALIFIED,

21:07.020 --> 21:07.980
BUT IN PRACTICE,

21:08.020 --> 21:09.980
THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN.

21:10.020 --> 21:10.980
JUST WATCH ONE CALIFORNIA MAN

21:11.020 --> 21:11.980
LEARN IT HAPPENED TO HIM

21:12.020 --> 21:14.980
IN 2018.

21:15.020 --> 21:15.980
>> TATTOO ARTIST JOHNNY TREVINO

21:16.020 --> 21:17.980
LOVES TO CREATE.

21:18.020 --> 21:18.980
>> GOOD TO GO.

21:19.020 --> 21:19.980
>> DRAWING ON HUMAN SKIN.

21:20.020 --> 21:20.980
>> LOOK AT HOW SMOOTH IT IS,

21:21.020 --> 21:21.980
TOO.

21:22.020 --> 21:22.980
>> THAT'S WHY TREVINO SAYS IT

21:23.020 --> 21:24.980
CAME AS A SHOCK WHEN WE SHOWED

21:25.020 --> 21:25.980
HIM THAT THE WAY HE DRAWS HIS

21:26.020 --> 21:26.980
SIGNATURE ACTUALLY CAUSED HIS

21:27.020 --> 21:29.000
BALLOT TO BE REJECTED DURING THE

21:30.000 --> 21:30.980
LAST MAJOR ELECTION IN 2018.

21:31.020 --> 21:31.980
>> THE REASON IS NO SIGNATURE

21:32.020 --> 21:34.980
MATCH.

21:35.020 --> 21:35.980
I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS.

21:36.020 --> 21:36.980
>> DOES THAT FRUSTRATE YOU?

21:37.020 --> 21:37.980
>> YES.

21:38.020 --> 21:40.980
BECAUSE I'M A TATTOO ARTIST AND

21:41.020 --> 21:41.980
SOMETIMES I WRITE IT BEAUTIFUL

21:42.020 --> 21:42.980
AND SOMETIMES I JUST SIGN IT

21:43.020 --> 21:43.980
QUICK.

21:44.020 --> 21:44.980
AND I BET YOU A LOT OF PEOPLE DO

21:45.020 --> 21:45.980
THAT.

21:46.020 --> 21:46.980
>> John: OKAY, THAT IS

21:47.020 --> 21:47.980
UNFORTUNATE TO FIND OUT.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.980
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY,

21:50.020 --> 21:50.980
"SOMETIMES I WRITE IT BEAUTIFUL

21:51.020 --> 21:51.980
AND SOMETIMES I JUST SIGN IT

21:52.020 --> 21:52.980
QUICK" IS ONE OF THE LAST THINGS

21:53.020 --> 21:53.980
YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE

21:54.020 --> 21:55.980
GIVING YOU A TATTOO.

21:56.020 --> 21:56.980
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH

21:57.020 --> 21:57.980
"YOU KNOW, I'M MORE OF

21:58.020 --> 21:59.980
A HANDS-FREE ARTIST."

22:00.020 --> 22:01.980
BUT LOOK, LET'S SAY THAT NONE OF

22:02.020 --> 22:03.980
WHAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT SO FAR

22:04.020 --> 22:04.980
TURNS OUT TO BE A PROBLEM.

22:05.020 --> 22:05.980
EVERYONE BEHAVES THEMSELVES AT

22:06.020 --> 22:07.980
POLLING PLACES, THE LINES AREN'T

22:08.020 --> 22:09.980
TOO LONG, AND NOBODY FUCKS UP

22:10.020 --> 22:12.980
THEIR MAIL-IN BALLOT.

22:13.020 --> 22:16.980
THERE IS STILL ONE MORE

22:17.020 --> 22:17.980
POTENTIAL WRINKLE IN THIS

22:18.020 --> 22:19.000
ELECTION, AND IT HAPPENS AFTER

22:19.000 --> 22:19.020
YOU'VE VOTED.

22:19.020 --> 22:20.000
BECAUSE MAIL-IN BALLOTS IN

22:20.000 --> 22:20.020
PARTICULAR CAN TAKE A LONG TIME

22:20.020 --> 22:22.980
TO COUNT.

22:23.020 --> 22:23.980
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE -- IT'S

22:24.020 --> 22:24.980
A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE.

22:25.020 --> 22:26.980
>> BEFORE THE COUNT CAN BEGIN,

22:27.020 --> 22:27.980
A SERIES OF PROCEDURES NEED TO

22:28.020 --> 22:28.980
BE FOLLOWED -- LIKE MAKING SURE

22:29.020 --> 22:29.980
THE VOTE COUNT FROM A PARTICULAR

22:30.020 --> 22:33.980
PRECINCT MATCHES UP WITH

22:34.020 --> 22:34.980
THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF BALLOTS

22:35.020 --> 22:35.980
RECEIVED.

22:36.020 --> 22:36.980
THE CITY OF GRAND RAPIDS HAS

22:37.020 --> 22:37.980
ISSUED SOME 35,000 ABSENTEE

22:38.020 --> 22:38.980
BALLOTS.

22:39.020 --> 22:39.980
>> JUST THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF

22:40.020 --> 22:41.980
OPENING THAT MANY ENVELOPES,

22:42.020 --> 22:42.980
THAT TAKES A LONG TIME.

22:43.020 --> 22:46.000
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE IT

22:46.000 --> 22:46.020
DOES.

22:46.020 --> 22:48.980
35,000 IS A SHIT-TON OF

22:49.020 --> 22:49.980
ENVELOPES, AND OPENING THEM IS

22:50.020 --> 22:50.980
GOING TO TAKE A LONG FUCKING

22:51.020 --> 22:51.980
TIME.

22:52.020 --> 22:53.980
WHICH, BY THE WAY, SHOULD

22:54.020 --> 22:54.980
PROBABLY BE THE OFFICIAL TAGLINE

22:55.020 --> 22:55.980
OF EVERY SINGLE AWARD SHOW:

22:56.020 --> 22:56.980
THE OSCARS!

22:57.020 --> 22:57.980
THERE ARE A SHIT TON OF

22:58.020 --> 22:58.980
ENVELOPES TO OPEN, SO IT'S GONNA

22:59.020 --> 23:00.980
TAKE A LONG FUCKING TIME!

23:01.020 --> 23:01.980
SUNDAY, 8:00, 7:00 CENTRAL,

23:02.020 --> 23:02.980
ON ABC.

23:03.020 --> 23:05.000
AND MAKING IT WORSE, IN SOME

23:06.000 --> 23:06.020
KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES, LIKE

23:06.020 --> 23:07.980
PENNSYLVANIA AND WISCONSIN,

23:08.020 --> 23:09.640
THEY'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO

23:10.000 --> 23:10.980
BEGIN PROCESSING MAIL-IN BALLOTS

23:11.020 --> 23:12.980
UNTIL ELECTION DAY ITSELF.

23:13.020 --> 23:13.980
WHICH BRINGS US TO SOMETHING

23:14.020 --> 23:16.980
VERY IMPORTANT.

23:17.020 --> 23:17.980
BECAUSE THERE IS A NATURAL

23:18.020 --> 23:18.980
VULNERABILITY HERE THAT

23:19.020 --> 23:19.980
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN MAY BE ABLE

23:20.020 --> 23:20.980
TO EXPLOIT IF WE'RE NOT

23:21.020 --> 23:21.980
EXTREMELY CAREFUL.

23:22.020 --> 23:23.980
REMEMBER, HE MAY RECEIVE

23:24.020 --> 23:25.940
A LARGER PROPORTION OF IN-PERSON

23:26.000 --> 23:26.980
VOTES, AND THOSE WILL GET

23:27.020 --> 23:28.580
COUNTED FASTER, LEADING TO

23:29.000 --> 23:29.980
A POTENTIAL PROBLEM.

23:30.020 --> 23:31.980
>> ELECTION EXPERTS SAY ONE

23:32.020 --> 23:32.980
POSSIBLE ELECTION SCENARIO IS

23:33.020 --> 23:34.980
WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE BLUE SHIFT.

23:35.020 --> 23:36.980
WITH TRUMP AHEAD ON ELECTION

23:37.020 --> 23:38.980
NIGHT AND BIDEN PULLING IN FRONT

23:39.020 --> 23:39.980
AFTER ELECTION NIGHT THROUGH

23:40.020 --> 23:42.000
MAIL-IN BALLOTS.

23:42.000 --> 23:42.020
>> THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS

23:42.020 --> 23:43.400
ELECTION NIGHT RESULTS.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.980
THEY'RE ONLY PARTIAL RESULTS AND

23:45.020 --> 23:47.000
THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN PARTIAL

23:47.000 --> 23:47.020
RESULTS.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.980
>> John: EXACTLY.

23:49.020 --> 23:49.980
MANY VOTES ARE COUNTED AFTER

23:50.020 --> 23:51.980
ELECTION NIGHT.

23:52.020 --> 23:53.980
AND THIS YEAR, THE DISCREPANCY

23:54.020 --> 23:54.980
IN HOW PEOPLE VOTE COULD LEAD TO

23:55.020 --> 23:56.980
A SO-CALLED "BLUE SHIFT," WHICH

23:57.020 --> 23:57.980
I KNOW SOUNDS LIKE A EUPHEMISM

23:58.020 --> 23:59.980
FOR A SMURF'S BOWEL MOVEMENT,

24:00.020 --> 24:00.980
BUT IT ACTUALLY REFERS TO

24:01.020 --> 24:02.980
THE IDEA THAT, SINCE MORE BIDEN

24:03.020 --> 24:03.980
SUPPORTERS ARE VOTING BY MAIL,

24:04.020 --> 24:05.980
DEMOCRATS COULD INITIALLY BE

24:06.020 --> 24:07.980
BEHIND, THEN PULL AHEAD ONCE ALL

24:08.020 --> 24:10.980
THE MAIL BALLOTS ARE COUNTED.

24:11.020 --> 24:12.980
THE CONCERN IS THAT, IN THAT

24:13.020 --> 24:13.980
EARLY STAGE, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

24:14.020 --> 24:14.980
COULD DECLARE VICTORY, AND CLAIM

24:15.020 --> 24:15.980
ANY ADDITIONAL BALLOTS ARE

24:16.020 --> 24:17.980
FRAUDULENT.

24:18.020 --> 24:18.980
HE HIMSELF HAS TWEETED THAT WE

24:19.020 --> 24:20.980
"MUST KNOW ELECTION RESULTS ON

24:21.020 --> 24:23.000
THE NIGHT OF THE ELECTION,

24:23.000 --> 24:23.020
NOT DAYS, MONTHS, OR EVEN

24:23.020 --> 24:24.980
YEARS LATER."

24:25.020 --> 24:26.980
BUT HERE'S THE THING: WE DON'T

24:27.020 --> 24:27.980
NEED TO KNOW ON THE NIGHT, AT

24:28.020 --> 24:29.980
ALL.

24:30.020 --> 24:30.980
PROJECTING WINNERS ON ELECTION

24:31.020 --> 24:32.980
NIGHT CAN BE A BIT LIKE

24:33.020 --> 24:33.980
SUMMARIZING "GET OUT" WHEN

24:34.020 --> 24:34.980
YOU'VE ONLY SEEN THE BEGINNING:

24:35.020 --> 24:35.980
IT'S ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO MEETS

24:36.020 --> 24:36.980
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S PARENTS FOR THE

24:37.020 --> 24:37.980
FIRST TIME, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY

24:38.020 --> 24:38.980
NERVE-RACKING!

24:39.020 --> 24:40.980
BUT LUCKILY, HER PARENTS SEEM

24:41.020 --> 24:42.980
LIKE A COUPLE OF REAL SWEETIES,

24:43.020 --> 24:44.980
SO EVERYTHING'S COOL!

24:45.020 --> 24:45.980
YEAH, THAT'S HOW IT STARTS, BUT

24:46.020 --> 24:46.980
MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP TALKING

24:47.020 --> 24:48.980
UNTIL YOU KNOW THE WHOLE STORY.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.980
AND IN AN ELECTION WITH SO MANY

24:51.020 --> 24:52.980
MAIL-IN VOTES, IT MAY TAKE

24:53.020 --> 24:54.980
SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER TO GET

24:55.020 --> 24:55.980
THE FINAL RESULTS THAN IT HAS IN

24:56.020 --> 24:57.980
THE PAST, AND THE SWING COULD BE

24:58.020 --> 25:01.980
EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED.

25:02.020 --> 25:02.980
THAT IS WHY ELECTION OFFICIALS

25:03.020 --> 25:03.980
ARE SO ANXIOUS TO RESET OUR

25:04.020 --> 25:04.980
EXPECTATIONS.

25:05.020 --> 25:05.980
>> THE EXPECTATION IS ELECTION

25:06.020 --> 25:07.980
NIGHT, LIKE MOST ELECTION

25:08.020 --> 25:08.980
NIGHTS, AROUND MIDNIGHT, 1:00,

25:09.020 --> 25:10.980
WE KNOW WHO THE PRESIDENT IS

25:11.020 --> 25:11.980
GOING TO BE.

25:12.020 --> 25:13.880
AND IN 2020, THAT IS SIMPLY NOT

25:14.000 --> 25:14.980
GOING TO BE THE CASE.

25:15.020 --> 25:16.980
THE EXPECTATION SHOULD BE THAT

25:17.020 --> 25:17.980
WE WILL PROBABLY NOT KNOW THE

25:18.020 --> 25:18.980
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

25:19.020 --> 25:23.980
UNTIL MID TO LATE NOVEMBER.

25:24.020 --> 25:24.980
>> John: YEAH, IF THIS ELECTION

25:25.020 --> 25:25.980
IS CLOSE, WE MAY NOT KNOW

25:26.020 --> 25:26.980
FOR A WHILE.

25:27.020 --> 25:28.460
SO IT MIGHT HELP TO STOP

25:29.000 --> 25:29.020
THINKING OF IT AS

25:29.020 --> 25:29.980
"ELECTION NIGHT" AND MORE AS AN

25:30.020 --> 25:30.980
"ELECTION MONTH," WHICH IS A LOT

25:31.020 --> 25:31.980
LIKE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS IT'S

25:32.020 --> 25:33.980
THEIR "BIRTHDAY MONTH" IN THAT

25:34.020 --> 25:34.980
THE VERY CONCEPT MAKES EVERY

25:35.020 --> 25:36.980
DECENT AMERICAN WANT TO VOMIT.

25:37.020 --> 25:37.980
AND THIS IS GOING TO TAKE AN

25:38.020 --> 25:39.880
ADJUSTMENT ON EVERYBODY'S PART,

25:40.000 --> 25:40.980
FROM INDIVIDUAL VOTERS,

25:41.020 --> 25:41.980
TO TV NETWORKS THAT ARE

25:42.020 --> 25:43.000
ACCUSTOMED TO GOING ALL-OUT

25:43.000 --> 25:43.960
IN SELLING "ELECTION NIGHT"

25:44.000 --> 25:47.980
AS AN EVENT.

25:48.020 --> 25:51.000
TO SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS THAT

25:51.000 --> 25:51.020
COULD BECOME CESSPOOLS OF

25:51.020 --> 25:51.980
MISINFORMATION.

25:52.020 --> 25:52.980
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF PLACES

25:53.020 --> 25:53.980
WHERE REPUBLICANS MIGHT BE ABLE

25:54.020 --> 25:54.980
TO PUT THEIR THUMB ON THE SCALE

25:55.020 --> 25:56.000
THIS ELECTION.

25:57.000 --> 25:57.980
AND IF YOU THINK ANY OF THIS IS

25:58.020 --> 25:58.980
ME BEING PARANOID, YOU SHOULD

25:59.020 --> 26:00.980
KNOW, IT'S ALREADY STARTED.

26:01.020 --> 26:03.000
IN WISCONSIN, REPUBLICAN

26:03.000 --> 26:03.020
LEGISLATORS THREATENED TO SUE

26:03.020 --> 26:04.980
ELECTIONS OFFICIALS FOR HOLDING

26:05.020 --> 26:05.980
AN EARLY-VOTING EVENT WHERE

26:06.020 --> 26:07.000
10,000 PEOPLE CAST BALLOTS,

26:07.000 --> 26:07.960
SUGGESTING THEY MIGHT SEEK TO

26:08.000 --> 26:08.020
HAVE ALL THOSE VOTES

26:08.020 --> 26:09.980
INVALIDATED.

26:10.020 --> 26:11.580
MEANWHILE, IN TEXAS, THEIR

26:12.000 --> 26:12.980
GOVERNOR HAS INSISTED THAT

26:13.020 --> 26:14.980
DROP-OFF LOCATIONS FOR ABSENTEE

26:15.020 --> 26:15.980
BALLOTS BE LIMITED TO JUST ONE

26:16.020 --> 26:17.980
PER COUNTY, WHETHER IT'S

26:18.020 --> 26:18.980
LOVING COUNTY, WHICH HAS JUST

26:19.020 --> 26:20.980
169 RESIDENTS, OR HARRIS COUNTY,

26:21.020 --> 26:23.980
WHICH HAS MORE THAN

26:24.020 --> 26:25.980
FOUR MILLION,

26:26.020 --> 26:27.000
ALTHOUGH I GUESS THAT DOES TRACK

26:27.000 --> 26:27.020
WITH TEXAS'S FAMOUS SLOGAN:

26:27.020 --> 26:27.980
DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS, UNLESS

26:28.020 --> 26:28.980
YOU'RE DIRECTING THEM TO A

26:29.020 --> 26:29.980
SINGLE VOTING NEXUS,

26:30.020 --> 26:30.980
EVEN WHILE SOME OF THEM COULD BE

26:31.020 --> 26:36.980
DANGEROUSLY INFECTIOUS.

26:37.020 --> 26:37.980
THAT SLOGAN NEVER MADE SENSE

26:38.020 --> 26:38.980
TO ME UNTIL JUST NOW.

26:39.020 --> 26:39.980
AND THIS BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL

26:40.020 --> 26:40.980
POINT: WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP

26:41.020 --> 26:41.980
THE SYSTEM RUN SMOOTHER?

26:42.020 --> 26:43.000
WELL, LUCKILY, THERE ARE STEPS

26:43.000 --> 26:43.780
YOU CAN TAKE.

26:44.000 --> 26:44.020
FIRST, AS AN INDIVIDUAL,

26:44.020 --> 26:44.980
MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.980
YOU CAN FIND INFORMATION FOR

26:47.020 --> 26:47.980
YOUR STATE AT CanIVote.org.

26:48.020 --> 26:51.980
IF YOU WANT TO DO IT IN-PERSON,

26:52.020 --> 26:52.980
ON ELECTION DAY, THAT'S GREAT.

26:53.020 --> 26:53.980
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T WANT EVERYONE

26:54.020 --> 26:54.980
DOING THAT, BECAUSE REMEMBER:

26:55.020 --> 26:55.980
WITH FEWER POLLING PLACES OPEN

26:56.020 --> 26:57.880
THIS YEAR, THAT COULD LEAD TO A

26:58.000 --> 26:59.980
"RUN THE JEWELS" LISTENING PARTY

27:00.020 --> 27:01.980
THAT NOBODY WANTS.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.980
SO IF YOUR SCHEDULE IS FLEXIBLE

27:04.020 --> 27:04.980
ENOUGH, AND YOU LIVE IN A STATE

27:05.020 --> 27:05.980
WHERE YOU CAN VOTE EARLY, YOU

27:06.020 --> 27:06.980
SHOULD DO THAT, ESPECIALLY TO

27:07.020 --> 27:07.980
MAKE THE LINES SHORTER ON

27:08.020 --> 27:08.980
ELECTION DAY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T

27:09.020 --> 27:09.980
HAVE THAT LUXURY.

27:10.020 --> 27:11.980
NOW IF YOU WANT TO VOTE BY

27:12.020 --> 27:12.980
MAIL, THAT'S GREAT, TOO.

27:13.020 --> 27:13.980
BUT WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO

27:14.020 --> 27:14.980
FLATTEN THE VOTING CURVE TO TAKE

27:15.020 --> 27:16.980
THE PRESSURE OFF THE SYSTEM.

27:17.020 --> 27:17.980
SO REQUEST YOUR BALLOT AS EARLY

27:18.020 --> 27:20.980
AS POSSIBLE, READ ALL THE

27:21.020 --> 27:21.980
INSTRUCTIONS, AND SEND IT BACK,

27:22.020 --> 27:22.980
OR DROP IT OFF, AS SOON AS

27:23.020 --> 27:24.980
YOU'VE FILLED IT IN.

27:25.020 --> 27:25.980
OH, AND ALSO, DO BE CAREFUL WITH

27:26.020 --> 27:26.980
YOUR SIGNATURE, UNLESS YOU WANT

27:27.020 --> 27:27.980
SOME LOCAL NEWS REPORTER TO SHOW

27:28.020 --> 27:29.980
UP TWO YEARS FROM NOW AND TELL

27:30.020 --> 27:30.980
YOU YOUR VOTE DIDN'T COUNT AND

27:31.020 --> 27:31.980
THROW YOUR SKILLS AS A TATTOO

27:32.020 --> 27:33.980
ARTIST INTO SIGNIFICANT DOUBT.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.980
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE STILL

27:36.020 --> 27:38.980
WORRIED ABOUT MAILING YOUR

27:39.020 --> 27:39.980
BALLOT IN, IT IS WORTH KNOWING

27:40.020 --> 27:40.980
46 STATES HAVE SOME FORM OF

27:41.020 --> 27:41.980
BALLOT TRACKING, SO YOU CAN

27:42.020 --> 27:42.980
BE SURE IT WAS RECEIVED AND

27:43.020 --> 27:43.980
COUNTED.

27:44.020 --> 27:44.980
AND YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY USE

27:45.020 --> 27:46.980
THAT RESOURCE IF YOU CAN.

27:47.020 --> 27:48.980
THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO

27:49.020 --> 27:50.980
REMEMBER IS, THIS ELECTION IS

27:51.020 --> 27:51.980
ALREADY VERY DIFFERENT FROM ALL

27:52.020 --> 27:52.980
THOSE BEFORE IT.

27:53.020 --> 27:54.980
SO WE ALL NEED TO BE ON TOP OF

27:55.020 --> 27:55.980
NOT ONLY OUR OWN VOTING PLANS,

27:56.020 --> 27:56.980
BUT MAKING SURE OUR FRIENDS AND

27:57.020 --> 27:57.980
FAMILY ARE ON TOP OF THEIRS AS

27:58.020 --> 28:00.980
WELL.

28:01.020 --> 28:02.980
BECAUSE I HAVE TO SAY, IF YOUR

28:03.020 --> 28:03.980
PLAN IS TO JUST SIT BACK AND

28:04.020 --> 28:05.980
EXPECT THE SYSTEM TO MAGICALLY

28:06.020 --> 28:06.980
WORK ITSELF OUT, AND THAT THIS

28:07.020 --> 28:07.980
MAN WILL HAVE A THREE-QUARTER

32:30.020 --> 32:31.980

ISN'T A VERY ELEGANT PAINTING

32:35.020 --> 32:35.980
OF WENDY EATING A LAMB CHOP,

32:36.020 --> 32:38.980
I SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

32:39.020 --> 32:41.980
LOOK, IN MOMENTS OF SUFFERING,
