[Pepi whistling]

01:47.315 --> 01:49.150
- Morning, Mr. Pirovitch.
- Good morning.

01:49.233 --> 01:52.027
- Always the first one, huh?
- It's none of your business.

01:52.111 --> 01:54.279
And let me tell you,
it doesn't hurt to be too early.

01:54.363 --> 01:57.157
What for and why?
Who sees you? Me.

01:57.241 --> 02:00.285
And who sees me? You.
What does it get us?

02:00.369 --> 02:02.662
Can we give each other a raise?
No.

02:02.747 --> 02:03.914
What are you doing
with that bicycle?

02:03.998 --> 02:05.290
You're not supposed
to take it at home.

02:05.374 --> 02:07.000
Better not let
Mr. Matuschek see it.

02:07.084 --> 02:09.294
Why don't you tell him?
It's alright with me.

02:09.377 --> 02:10.961
You know where I was last night
while you were home

02:11.047 --> 02:12.590
soaking your feet in hot water?

02:12.673 --> 02:14.883
Running my legs off
for Mrs. Matuschek.

02:14.967 --> 02:16.468
"Pepi, go to the dressmaker."

02:16.552 --> 02:18.428
And when I come back,
"Oh, Pepi, will you please

02:18.512 --> 02:19.888
pick up a package
at the drugstore?"

02:19.972 --> 02:21.390
Good morning.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.892
- Good morning, Miss Kaczek.
- Good morning.

02:22.975 --> 02:25.268
- How's your little boy?
- Much better, thanks.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.896
We called Dr. Hegedus.

02:26.979 --> 02:28.313
Oh, he's a very
expensive doctor.

02:28.397 --> 02:30.065
Well, what can you do?

02:30.149 --> 02:32.234
I figured I'd cut down
on my cigars for a few weeks.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.610
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:33.694 --> 02:35.195
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Ilona.

02:35.279 --> 02:37.906
Oh, that's a new silver fox!
It's stunning!

02:37.990 --> 02:39.324
It must have been
pretty expensive.

02:39.408 --> 02:41.159
Oh, it was. I hesitated

02:41.243 --> 02:42.661
a long time before I bought it.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.580
I said, "No, I can't afford it."

02:44.664 --> 02:46.207
And still, I couldn't
take my eyes off it.

02:46.290 --> 02:48.166
And then I said,
"No, I have no right to--"

02:48.250 --> 02:50.210
And then he said,
"Oh, go on and take it."

02:50.294 --> 02:52.296
- Oh, trying to be clever!
- Shut up.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.131
- Good morning.
- Morning, Mr. Kralik.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.800
Pepi, go to the drugstore and
get me a bicarbonate of soda.

02:56.884 --> 02:58.385
- What's the matter, Kralik?
- Do you feel well?

02:58.469 --> 03:00.220
Oh, it's alright. Just a..

03:00.304 --> 03:03.140
Good morning, good morning,
good morning, good morning.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.559
- Want to hear a joke?
- No.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.227
What's the matter, folks?

03:07.311 --> 03:09.479
Not awake yet? Look at me.

03:09.563 --> 03:11.606
I bet I haven't slept
half as much as you.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.651
Friends, Romans, countrymen

03:13.734 --> 03:15.277
to tell you the truth, I, uh..

03:15.361 --> 03:16.779
...had quite a time last night.

03:16.862 --> 03:18.613
We don't want to hear
the poor girl's name.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.825
Tell me, Kralik,
how was the dinner last night?

03:20.908 --> 03:22.868
Oh, yes, that's right!

03:22.952 --> 03:24.662
Mr. Kralik had dinner
with the boss last night.

03:24.745 --> 03:26.997
Well, well, well, how was it?
Tell us all about it.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.373
Are you a partner now,
Mr. Kralik?

03:28.457 --> 03:29.583
Don't be funny.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.001
[indistinct chatter]

03:31.085 --> 03:32.711
- Tell us about it.
- How was it?

03:32.795 --> 03:35.214
Well, it was a very nice
evening, and I enjoyed myself.

03:35.297 --> 03:36.798
I bet the food was good.

03:36.882 --> 03:38.341
- Well, you can imagine.
- Tell me.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.010
Is it true Mrs. Matuschek
had her face lifted?

03:40.094 --> 03:41.512
Well, how could I know that?

03:41.595 --> 03:43.763
Well, how old did she look
to you last night?

03:43.848 --> 03:45.266
Well, 40.

03:45.349 --> 03:46.725
She had her face lifted.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.185
I think Mrs. Matuschek

03:48.269 --> 03:49.228
is a very charming woman.

03:49.311 --> 03:50.895
Who said she isn't?

03:50.980 --> 03:52.648
And don't you try to make
something out of nothing.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.692
I didn't say Mrs. Matuschek
is not charming.

03:54.775 --> 03:56.610
But I said she is charming.
What's wrong with that?

03:56.694 --> 03:58.445
So the food was good?

03:58.529 --> 04:00.656
Seven courses, not
including the hors d'oeuvres.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.032
I bet you were sitting
next to Mrs. Matuschek.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.325
Yes, I was.
What do you think of that?

04:03.409 --> 04:04.910
- I bet you were brilliant.
- No.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.912
I just kept still
and tried to learn something.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.330
Here's your bicarbonate,
Mr. Kralik.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.082
- Thanks, Pepi.
- Uh, bicarbonate? Aren't you..

04:10.166 --> 04:11.750
I had a little too much
goose liver last night.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.711
I see. What's the matter?
Wasn't it any good?

04:14.795 --> 04:16.922
Now, look here, Vadas.
Now, just a minute.

04:17.005 --> 04:18.382
Folks, come over.
Did you hear what he said?

04:18.466 --> 04:19.925
Just, I want you to hear this.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.344
Did I make any derogatory remark
about the goose liver?

04:22.428 --> 04:23.887
- No, not any!
- Not one word!

04:23.971 --> 04:26.306
I merely said that
I had too much goose liver.

04:26.390 --> 04:28.558
"A little too much goose liver."

04:28.642 --> 04:29.893
"A little too much goose liver."

04:29.977 --> 04:32.187
Not one word more,
and not one less.

04:32.271 --> 04:35.148
[clamoring]

04:38.194 --> 04:40.196
- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
- Yeah, good morning.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.197
Here.

04:44.241 --> 04:45.951
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.963
Who put this 32.50 suitcase
in the window?

04:59.006 --> 05:00.340
I did, Mr. Matuschek.

05:01.717 --> 05:02.884
I guess it's alright.

05:02.968 --> 05:04.886
Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

05:04.970 --> 05:07.389
- Yeah. Pepi.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.641
Just, uh, go across the street

05:09.725 --> 05:11.309
to the drugstore,
and get me some

05:11.393 --> 05:12.894
bicarbonate of soda.

05:12.978 --> 05:14.562
Yes, sir.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.148
Allow me, Mr. Matuschek.
May I help?

05:19.985 --> 05:20.944
There we are, Mr. Matuschek.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.796
- Pirovitch.
- Hmm?

05:38.879 --> 05:41.548
- Wanna hear something nice?
- Yes. What is it?

05:41.632 --> 05:43.133
- A letter from a girl.
- Oh.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.847
"My heart was trembling
as I walked into the post office

05:48.931 --> 05:51.433

...oh, my dear friend."

06:00.359 --> 06:01.651
What is all this?

06:01.735 --> 06:03.737
You see, I wanted to buy
an encyclopedia.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.781
Encyclopedia?
What're you talking about?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.366
Well, you come to a time
in your life

06:07.449 --> 06:09.325
when you get tired
of going to cafes

06:09.410 --> 06:11.912
dance halls every night, and
you want to improve yourself.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.248
I've heard you want to study
something about art and

06:14.331 --> 06:15.915

all this to do with the letter?

06:20.421 --> 06:22.881
Well, you know I can't afford
a new encyclopedia

06:22.965 --> 06:24.758
so I was looking through the ads
in the Sunday paper

06:24.842 --> 06:26.260
and I got on the wrong page

06:26.343 --> 06:28.219
and I came across this ad,
and it..

06:28.304 --> 06:30.180
Wait a minute,
I have it right here.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.224
Here, read that.

06:47.114 --> 06:49.324
I know those ads.
The papers are full of them.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.742
How long has this been going on?

06:50.826 --> 06:52.369
Well, we've exchanged
four letters.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.164
- Four letters?
- And she's no ordinary girl.

06:55.247 --> 06:56.248
Now listen to this.

06:57.666 --> 07:00.126
"Are you tall? Are you short?

so long as our minds meet?"

07:07.885 --> 07:09.720
That's beautiful.

07:09.803 --> 07:11.054
- It is, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

of these cigarette boxes

What do you think of it?

07:39.375 --> 07:40.501
I think it's great.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.086
Well, open it.

No, Mr. Matuschek,
it's not for us.

But you haven't listened to it.
It plays "Ochi Tchornya."

07:51.220 --> 07:53.472
Well, even if it played
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony

07:53.555 --> 07:56.099
I'd still say no.
No, I just don't like the idea.

07:56.183 --> 07:58.602
It's wonderful the way you can
make up your mind so quickly.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.437
I've been in this business
for 35 years.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.980
It took me a whole hour
to decide

08:02.064 --> 08:03.607
that I like this box.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.025
But, of course, you're a genius.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.152
You know so much more than I.

- Mr. Vadas?
- Coming, Mr. Matuschek.

08:12.032 --> 08:13.158
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek?
- Look here.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.534
What do you think of this?

08:14.618 --> 08:16.036
Now, I want your honest opinion.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.371
Don't let me influence you.

08:29.466 --> 08:31.050
Well, Miss Novotni?

08:31.135 --> 08:33.470
Well, I think people
who smoke cigarettes

08:33.554 --> 08:35.514
and love to hear "Ochi Tchornya"
will like it.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.056
I'd even go further.
I think it'll make

08:37.140 --> 08:38.517
music lovers
out of cigarette smokers

08:38.600 --> 08:40.268
and cigarette smokers
out of music lovers.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.602
I think it's sensational!

08:41.687 --> 08:43.270
Yeah, well, Mr. Kralik

08:43.355 --> 08:44.689
have you thought it over?

08:44.773 --> 08:46.733
Yes. I still think it's

08:46.817 --> 08:48.568
uh, inadvisable.

08:48.652 --> 08:51.655
Well, give me one reason!

08:51.739 --> 08:54.158
Well, let's say that a man
smokes 20 cigarettes a day.

08:54.241 --> 08:56.993
That means that 20 times a day
he has to open this box

08:57.077 --> 08:59.412
and 20 times a day he has
to listen to "Ochi Tchornya."

08:59.496 --> 09:01.331
It's a perfectly terrible idea.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.708
And besides, it's imitation
leather, the glue's no good

09:03.792 --> 09:05.293
in two weeks the whole thing
will fall apart

09:05.377 --> 09:06.711
and all you'll have left
is "Ochi Tchornya."

09:06.795 --> 09:08.213
You don't have to tell me

09:08.297 --> 09:10.924
that-that-that it's
imitation leather. I know that.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.510
You just sell things
and let me do the buying, huh?

09:13.594 --> 09:15.679
Excuse me, Mr. Matuschek.

to think about it.

No, no, no, no,
it's not the price.

I-I'm not quite sure

Yes, Mr. Miklos.

You can't expect me to make up
my mind in five minutes!

09:45.501 --> 09:47.920
Well, if that's the case,
then I'll have to say no.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.655
with or without
fitted accessories, eh?

10:15.739 --> 10:17.907
Uh, I really didn't come in
to buy a bag.

10:17.991 --> 10:19.617
Oh, I beg your pardon.

10:19.701 --> 10:21.369
Well, what can I show you?

10:21.453 --> 10:22.745
To tell you the truth, I

10:22.830 --> 10:24.039
really didn't come in
to buy anything.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.749
That's perfectly alright.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.918
Now, if you wish to look around,
just make yourself at home.

10:28.001 --> 10:29.127
Yes, thank you.

10:31.421 --> 10:34.924
Uh, I wonder if I could see
Mr. Matuschek.

10:35.008 --> 10:36.551
Well, unfortunately,
Mr. Matuschek

10:36.635 --> 10:38.595
is quite busy at the moment.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.180
Of course, I could
call him if you wanted.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.182
Oh, yes. I'd appreciate it.
Thank you very much.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.476
But if you will tell me your
wishes, it's quite possible

10:44.560 --> 10:45.978
I could take care of
them myself actually.

10:47.479 --> 10:49.772
Well, I noticed
in your shop window

10:49.857 --> 10:50.983
that you're having
a summer sale.

10:51.066 --> 10:52.567
Oh, yes, madam.
Everything in the shop

10:52.651 --> 10:53.818
is marked down 25 percent.

10:53.902 --> 10:55.153
Some articles even more.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.321
Uh, well, we have..

10:56.405 --> 10:58.031
Now, take for instance
this compact.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.950
Yesterday you couldn't get it
for a penny less than $3.90.

11:00.033 --> 11:01.492
Today, we're selling it
for $2.25.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.204
Oh, really?
Yes, that's a wonderful bargain.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.998
Yeah, well, everything
in the shop is a bargain today.

11:06.081 --> 11:08.708
Yes, I imagine you'll be
doing your big business.

11:08.792 --> 11:10.043
Oh, well, I have no doubt of it.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.128
You were very wise
to come early.

11:11.211 --> 11:12.545
We'll probably have
such a rush

11:12.629 --> 11:14.339
and won't be able
to take care of the customers.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.757
Well, in that case,
maybe you should

11:15.841 --> 11:16.925
take on some extra help.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.301
Oh, we probably will.

11:18.385 --> 11:20.387
Well, maybe you could use me.

11:20.470 --> 11:21.929
I'm looking for a job.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.394
You know,
that-that wasn't very nice

11:27.477 --> 11:29.437
L-letting me go through
the whole routine.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.356
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I really didn't mean to.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.899
Do you think you could help me
to get a job here?

11:32.983 --> 11:34.609
Well, I-I'd like to,
but there's no opening.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.152
But you just told me you'd need
some extra people

11:36.236 --> 11:37.403
because of the rush.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.157
Well, look around for yourself.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.200
You can see what kind
of business we're doing.

11:43.368 --> 11:44.327
I beg your pardon.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.330
Yes, madam?

11:46.413 --> 11:47.622
How much is that belt
in the window

11:47.706 --> 11:49.374
the one that says $2.95?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.042
- $2.95.
- Oh, no.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.048
Excuse me, but may I tell you
my qualifications?

11:57.132 --> 11:58.383
Look, I could do anything
for you, I'd do it.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.135
You know, I'm not
an inexperienced girl.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.929
But I know the situation here,
and there's no chance.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.013
I worked for two years
at Blasek and Company

12:03.096 --> 12:04.472
and I left of my own accord.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.307
And before that I was at
Latzki Brother 10 months.

12:06.391 --> 12:08.434
My dear child, even if you'd
worked at Mintz and Kramer--

12:08.518 --> 12:10.770
I did! I know how to take care
of the finest clientele.

12:10.854 --> 12:12.355
Well, we don't deal with
that class of people here.

12:12.439 --> 12:13.940
- We have middle-class trade.
- Middle-class?

12:14.024 --> 12:15.233
What kind of trade do you think
Blasek and Company has?

12:15.317 --> 12:16.609
They'd take me back
right this minute.

12:16.693 --> 12:17.902
Why don't you go back?

12:17.986 --> 12:19.362
Well, that's another story.

12:19.446 --> 12:20.864
Look, if it was up to me,
I'd put you

12:20.948 --> 12:22.115
to work right away.
But I'm not the boss.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.533
Then why don't you
let me see him?

12:23.617 --> 12:25.577
Well, he's in sort of
a bad mood today.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.704
Oh, I'll take a chance.
Maybe I can cheer him up.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.831
(Kralik) 'My dear young lady,
I've been here for nine years'

12:29.915 --> 12:31.917
'and I know Mr. Matuschek
inside out.'

12:32.000 --> 12:34.127
I can predict
his every reaction.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.713
I could tell you word for word
exactly what he'd say.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.673
Mr. Kralik?

12:38.757 --> 12:39.841
Uh, I beg your pardon.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.093
Just, uh,
just one moment, please.

12:42.177 --> 12:43.094
It's alright.

12:45.013 --> 12:48.057
So, you know every reaction
of mine, huh?

12:48.141 --> 12:49.976
You know me inside out?

12:50.060 --> 12:53.271
You know what I think
even before I thought of it.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.106
You're not only a genius,
you're a mind reader.

12:55.190 --> 12:56.774
- Mr. Matuschek--
- Never mind.

12:56.858 --> 12:57.859
Eh..

12:58.735 --> 12:59.944
Good morning, madam.

13:00.028 --> 13:01.696
I am Mr. Matuschek.

13:01.780 --> 13:05.533
- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
- Here, please, sit down.

13:05.617 --> 13:07.744
'So, I don't know
what the difficulty is'

13:07.828 --> 13:09.287
but I can assure you, madam

13:09.371 --> 13:11.456
that the word "impossible"
is not in the vocabulary

13:11.540 --> 13:12.916
of Matuschek and Company.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.459
I'm so happy
to hear you say that.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.835
[laughs]
Yes, and I mean it.

13:15.919 --> 13:17.879
- Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes, madam?

13:17.963 --> 13:19.172
I was at Blasek and Company--

13:19.256 --> 13:20.840
Oh, madam. I'm sure you'll find

13:20.924 --> 13:22.467
much nicer things in my shop.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.678
Oh, no, I mean, I worked there.

13:24.761 --> 13:26.888
- I'm looking for a job.
- Oh, no, no, that's impossible.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.348
- It's-it's out of the question.
- Mr. Matuschek--

13:28.432 --> 13:30.725
No, I've-I've no time.
No time. I'm very busy.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.436
I-I'm very sorry.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.563
I'm afraid you're just
wasting your time.

13:35.647 --> 13:37.106
But I've got to have a job.

13:37.190 --> 13:38.399
Mr. Kralik?

13:38.483 --> 13:39.942
Just a moment, Mr. Matuschek.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.403
Have you tried
Baum's Department Store?

13:42.195 --> 13:43.571
Every entrance.

13:43.655 --> 13:45.490
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.409
Maybe after inventory.

13:47.492 --> 13:49.410
- When will that be?
- In a week or so.

13:49.494 --> 13:51.370
- Kralik!
- Just a minute, Mr. Matuschek!

13:51.455 --> 13:53.165
Please, may I leave my address?

13:53.248 --> 13:55.250
Oh, yes, yes. If we need
anybody, you'll be the first.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.461
My name is Kiara Novak,
Duna Street, 42.

13:57.544 --> 14:00.088
And if you need me in a hurry,
you can phone 246-422.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.340
That's the, uh, grocery store
downstairs. Ask for Johanna

14:02.424 --> 14:03.925
and tell her you have
a business message for Kiara.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.637
"Business message for Kiara."
Yes, I have that.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.181
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek?
- Uh, close the door.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.479
Kralik, why did you put me

14:15.562 --> 14:17.647
in that situation
in front of the whole shop?

14:17.731 --> 14:20.150
Well, I'm very sorry, sir,
but it was not my fault.

14:20.233 --> 14:21.943
Well, whose fault was it? Mine?

14:22.027 --> 14:23.611
Well, yes.

14:23.695 --> 14:25.571
What's the matter with you,
Kralik?

14:25.655 --> 14:27.031
You're my oldest employee.

14:27.115 --> 14:29.784
I do everything I can
to show my appreciation.

14:29.868 --> 14:31.578
I-I-I ask you to my house.

14:31.661 --> 14:32.995
Well, I'm very grateful, sir.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.082
Well, you have a funny way
of showing it.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.500
You know how much
I value your judgment

14:37.584 --> 14:39.502
and on every occasion
you contradict me.

14:39.586 --> 14:41.087
Whatever I say, you say, "no."

14:41.171 --> 14:42.922
Alright, sir, from now on,
I say, "yes."

14:43.006 --> 14:44.590
"Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

14:44.674 --> 14:47.385
Certainly, Mr. Matuschek.
Yes, Mr. Matuschek."

14:47.469 --> 14:50.388
That was a nice party
last night, huh?

14:50.472 --> 14:51.973
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.435
Yes, I, uh, I had
a lot of fun, didn't you?

14:55.519 --> 14:56.561
Yes. I..

14:56.645 --> 14:58.021
Yeah, well, I'm-I'm glad

14:58.105 --> 15:00.190
you enjoyed yourself so much.

15:00.273 --> 15:01.732
That-that little poem
that you wrote

15:01.817 --> 15:03.109
in Mrs. Matuschek's guest book

15:03.193 --> 15:05.278
did you, uh,
make that up yourself?

15:05.362 --> 15:07.364
Well, it's sort of
half and half.

15:07.447 --> 15:08.823
Half and half? How do you mean?

15:08.907 --> 15:11.159
- Half Shakespeare and half me.
- Oh.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.535
See, I just changed
the lines around

15:12.619 --> 15:14.203
to suit the occasion.

15:14.287 --> 15:15.788
I made that last line rhyme

15:15.872 --> 15:17.248
with Matuschek, that's all.

15:17.332 --> 15:19.751
Oh, well, Mrs. Matuschek
liked it very much.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.378
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

15:21.461 --> 15:24.338
You-you made
a fine impression on her.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.676
Mrs. Matuschek thinks
a lot of you.

15:27.759 --> 15:31.053
And you know, I think
a lot of Mrs. Matuschek.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.849
[instrumental music]

15:33.932 --> 15:35.600
- Mr. Matuschek?
- 'Yes?â™ª

15:35.684 --> 15:37.560
I think I've found a customer
for the cigarette box.

15:37.644 --> 15:39.062
- Uh-huh!
- What price shall I quote?

15:39.146 --> 15:40.564
Well, let me see now.

15:40.647 --> 15:42.982
It, uh, it costs us $2.85

15:43.066 --> 15:44.692
and I think we get
five percent di..

15:47.696 --> 15:49.072
Let me take care of this,
Mr. Matuschek.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.242
Now, look, uh..

15:52.325 --> 15:54.160
There's no use waiting now.
Believe me.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.536
If there's an opening,
you'll be the first one.

15:55.620 --> 15:56.912
Uh, just a moment.

15:56.997 --> 16:00.250
Tell me, would you buy
a box like this?

16:00.333 --> 16:03.419
Oh, Mr. Matuschek, I couldn't
buy anything at the moment.

16:03.503 --> 16:05.338
No, no, no, no.
I-I-I-I want your opinion.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.714
Your honest opinion.

16:06.798 --> 16:08.257
'Now, don't let me
influence you.'

16:08.341 --> 16:10.676
'I just want your opinion.'

16:10.760 --> 16:12.052
Do you like this box?

16:12.137 --> 16:14.722
Oh, yes, I do.
I think it's lovely.

16:14.806 --> 16:16.057
Yeah. Why?

16:17.225 --> 16:18.309
- Why?
- Yeah.

16:20.103 --> 16:21.646
I think it's romantic.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.064
What's romantic about it?

16:24.691 --> 16:26.150
Well..

16:26.234 --> 16:29.320
...cigarettes and music.
I don't know.

16:29.404 --> 16:33.157
It-it-it makes me think
of moonlight and..

16:34.784 --> 16:36.535
...cigarettes and music.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.413
There's the woman's
point of view.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.749
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

16:40.832 --> 16:42.750
- Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes, Miss..

16:42.834 --> 16:44.168
- Novak.
- Novak.

16:44.252 --> 16:45.586
How much are you selling it for?

16:45.670 --> 16:48.964
Well, uh, let me see. $4.25.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.718
- $4.25?
- Yes, $4.25.

16:51.801 --> 16:54.386
That's a bargain!
That's a real bargain!

17:00.185 --> 17:03.313
Good morning, madam.
It's a lovely box, isn't it?

17:03.396 --> 17:05.106
Oh, yes.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.193
It's a candy box, isn't it?

17:08.276 --> 17:10.694
Yes, madam, a candy box

17:10.779 --> 17:12.446
and I should say,
a very unusual one.

17:13.573 --> 17:15.156
May I open it for you?

17:17.160 --> 17:19.412
Oh, yes, madam.
That's "Ochi Tchornya."

17:19.496 --> 17:20.872
It's a very popular classic.

17:20.955 --> 17:22.874
Oh, no, that would never do.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.751
Where do people
get ideas like that?

17:24.834 --> 17:27.044
Can you imagine, every time
you take a piece of candy

17:27.127 --> 17:28.587
you have to listen to that song?

17:28.672 --> 17:30.298
No, I couldn't buy
a thing like that.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.050
'It's really too silly. No.'

17:32.133 --> 17:34.135
I know just what you mean,
madam.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.803
And yet, do you know
that some of our customers

17:35.887 --> 17:37.555
like it for the very thing
you object to.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.140
We've sold quite a few
especially to ladies.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.892
- Really?
- Yes, madam.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.310
There's no denying that we all

17:42.394 --> 17:44.270
have a weakness for candy.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.563
And when I say weakness
I don't mean to say

17:45.647 --> 17:46.689
anything against candy. Oh, no.

17:46.773 --> 17:48.274
I only mean that

17:48.358 --> 17:51.194
uh, sometimes we are inclined
to overdo it a little.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.487
I suppose so.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.114
For instance, madam,
have you any idea

17:54.197 --> 17:55.907
how many pieces of candy
you eat a day?

17:55.991 --> 17:57.283
No, I never gave it a thought.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.701
That's just it. We pick up

17:58.785 --> 18:00.036
a piece of candy absent-mindedly,

18:00.120 --> 18:01.621
then we take another piece.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.873
Before we know it, we've gained
a couple of pounds.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.375
And that's when
our troubles begin.

18:05.458 --> 18:06.792
Massages, electric cabinets.

18:06.876 --> 18:08.127
Oh, don't I know it.

18:08.211 --> 18:10.379
Now, this little box

18:10.463 --> 18:12.465
makes you candy-conscious.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.467
That's what "Matuschek
and Company" designed it for.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.511
Every time you open it,
this little tinkling song

18:16.595 --> 18:18.221
is a message to you.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.557
"Too much candy,
now be careful."

18:22.642 --> 18:24.101
How much is it?

18:24.185 --> 18:26.103
$5.50, reduced from $6.95.

18:26.187 --> 18:28.397
It's a real bargain.

18:28.481 --> 18:31.192
- I'll take it.
- Thank you, madam.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.152
Well, what do you say now?

18:33.236 --> 18:34.779
I think people
who like to smoke candy

18:34.863 --> 18:36.531
and listen to cigarettes
will love it.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.616
[chuckles]

18:39.951 --> 18:42.078
No. Well,
don't let me influence you.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.538
I want your opinion.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.874
'Your honest opinion,
that's all I want!'

18:48.752 --> 18:51.629
[engine revving]

18:56.259 --> 18:57.927
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.898
- Morning.
- Good morning, Kralik.

19:09.981 --> 19:11.983
Well, I've got a big
dinner date tonight.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.234
- With the boss?
- Oh, no.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.153
He never invites me anymore.

19:15.236 --> 19:17.279
Say, how do you figure him out,
anyway?

19:17.364 --> 19:19.240
I give up.
It's certainly very difficult

19:19.324 --> 19:20.491
to get along with him
these days.

19:20.575 --> 19:23.411
Yeah, he never talks to me
anymore.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.955
I hope he's feeling
more cheerful today.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.041
He better, because I'm going
to ask him for a raise.

19:28.124 --> 19:31.335
- A.. A raise?
- Mm-hmm.

19:31.419 --> 19:33.796
Pirovitch, do you mind if I ask
you a personal question?

19:33.880 --> 19:35.548
- No, go ahead.
- Well, it's very confidential.

19:35.632 --> 19:36.883
Yes, sure.

19:36.966 --> 19:38.258
Well, now suppose
that a fellow like me

19:38.343 --> 19:39.761
wants to, wants to get married.

19:39.844 --> 19:41.345
Well, that's wonderful!

19:41.429 --> 19:43.055
That's the best thing
that could happen to you.

19:43.139 --> 19:44.181
- Who's the girl?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

19:44.265 --> 19:45.891
What did I say?
I said, "suppose."

19:45.975 --> 19:47.977
I said, "a fellow like me."
I didn't say me.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.812
Now, look.
Now, how much did it cost

19:49.896 --> 19:51.814
you to live,
you and Mrs. Pirovitch?

19:51.898 --> 19:53.274
Leaving out the children.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.234
Well, why fool yourself?

19:55.318 --> 19:56.861
[laughs]

19:56.945 --> 19:58.988
Well, let's say temporarily.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.573
How much does it cost?

20:00.657 --> 20:02.200
- Well, it can be done.
- Yeah?

20:02.283 --> 20:04.451
Yes, and very nicely.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.913
U-uh, naturally,
you can't be extravagant.

20:06.996 --> 20:08.247
Well, I suppose a fellow

20:08.331 --> 20:09.582
gets an apartment
with three rooms.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.958
Dining room, bedroom,
living room.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.752
Three room? What do you need
three rooms for?

20:12.836 --> 20:14.128
You live in the bedroom.

20:14.212 --> 20:15.838
- Where do you eat?
- In the kitchen.

20:15.922 --> 20:17.298
You get a nice big kitchen.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.508
Where do you entertain?

20:18.591 --> 20:20.551
Entertain?
What are you, an ambassador?

20:20.635 --> 20:22.136
Who do you want to entertain?

20:22.220 --> 20:24.388
Listen, if someone
is really your friend

20:24.472 --> 20:25.890
he comes after dinner.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.643
Oh, no. Oh..

20:28.727 --> 20:30.228
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Novak.

20:30.311 --> 20:31.603
How's your wife, Mr. Pirovitch?

20:31.688 --> 20:33.147
- Oh, my goodness!
- What's the matter?

20:33.231 --> 20:34.941
I forgot to call Dr. Hegedus.

20:35.024 --> 20:35.983
Something serious
with your wife?

20:36.067 --> 20:37.526
No, no, she couldn't be better.

20:37.610 --> 20:38.694
Well, what do you want
to call the doctor for?

20:38.778 --> 20:40.446
If I don't call him, he'll come.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.782
Excuse me, I'd better
telephone him right away.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.242
I hope it isn't too late.

20:54.002 --> 20:56.087
- Miss Novak?
- Yes, Mr. Kralik?

20:56.171 --> 20:58.298
Uh, I noticed that
you wore a yellow blouse

20:58.381 --> 21:00.132
with light-green dots yesterday.

21:00.216 --> 21:02.635
No, Mr. Kralik.
As usual, you're mistaken.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.846
It was green blouse
with light-yellow dots.

21:04.929 --> 21:06.805
And everybody else thought
it was very becoming.

21:06.890 --> 21:09.100
I don't remember every remarking
about your neckties.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.435
And believe me, Mr. Kralik,
if you think

21:10.518 --> 21:11.936
I couldn't say anything
about your neckties

21:12.020 --> 21:14.063
just ask Mr. Vadas. So, please
leave my blouse alone.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.189
It's none of your business.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.482
Well, I'm sorry. Mr. Matuschek

21:16.566 --> 21:17.692
seems to think
it is my business.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.235
Oh, yes, that's right.

21:19.319 --> 21:20.778
I'm working under you.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.238
Well, from now on,
I'll telephone you every morning

21:22.322 --> 21:23.990
and describe exactly
what I'm going to wear.

21:24.073 --> 21:25.449
And before I select
my next season's wardrobe

21:25.533 --> 21:27.451
my dressmaker will submit
samples to you.

21:27.535 --> 21:29.119
Imagine you dictating
what I should wear.

21:29.204 --> 21:30.997
Well, for heaven's sake,
I don't care what you wear.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.332
If you wanna look like a pony
in the circus, it's alright.

21:33.416 --> 21:34.959
But I have my troubles of my own
without your blouse

21:35.043 --> 21:36.210
coming between
Mr. Matuschek and me.

21:36.294 --> 21:37.461
Listen, I sold
as much goods yesterday

21:37.545 --> 21:38.837
as anybody else in the shop.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.757
$95.50 isn't bad for
a rainy Monday three weeks

21:40.840 --> 21:42.091
before Christmas. Did you tell
that to Mr. Matuschek?

21:42.175 --> 21:43.801
- Yes, I did.
- And what did he say?

21:43.885 --> 21:45.386
He said, "Tell her not to come
in that blouse anymore."

21:45.470 --> 21:46.721
- Tell him I won't.
- I will!

21:50.892 --> 21:52.810
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.437
Well, I caught him just in time.

21:54.521 --> 21:55.688
Saves me five pengo

21:55.772 --> 21:57.023
and that counts
when you're married.

21:57.106 --> 21:58.273
Is this tie alright
to wear to work?

21:58.358 --> 21:59.817
Yeah, quite alright. Come on.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.360
Tell me, who is the girl?

22:01.444 --> 22:04.029
Oh, well, you know that girl
I was corresponding with?

22:04.113 --> 22:05.280
Oh, yes,
about the cultural subjects.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.908
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

22:06.991 --> 22:09.368
Well, after a while
we got on the subject of love

22:09.452 --> 22:11.704
...naturally
on a very cultural level.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.372
Well, what else can you do
in a letter?

22:13.456 --> 22:15.624
He is the most wonderful girl
in the world.

22:15.708 --> 22:17.459
Is she pretty?

22:17.544 --> 22:19.295
She has such ideals

22:19.379 --> 22:20.838
and such a viewpoint on things

22:20.922 --> 22:22.256
that she's so far
above the girls

22:22.340 --> 22:24.133
you meet today,
there's no comparison.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.676
So, she is not so very pretty?

22:25.760 --> 22:27.678
- Oh, no, don't say that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

22:27.762 --> 22:29.096
The main thing
is that you like her.

22:29.180 --> 22:30.973
Yeah, I hope I will.

22:31.057 --> 22:32.433
What do you mean?
You love a girl

22:32.517 --> 22:34.101
and you don't know
if you like her?

22:34.185 --> 22:36.854
Well, that's-that's
just the question.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.064
I haven't met her yet.

22:38.147 --> 22:40.065
- What? You haven't met her yet?
- No.

22:40.149 --> 22:43.152
I keep postponing it
and postponing it. I..

22:43.236 --> 22:44.779
I'm scared.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.239
You see, this girl thinks

22:46.322 --> 22:47.948
I'm the most
wonderful person in the world.

22:48.032 --> 22:49.491
And after all there is

22:49.576 --> 22:51.452
a chance she might be
disappointed.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.788
- Yes, there is a chance.
- Yeah. On the other hand--

22:53.872 --> 22:55.623
Uh, you might be
disappointed, too.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.291
And I don't dare think about it.

22:59.043 --> 23:00.711
Pirovitch..

23:00.795 --> 23:02.546
...did you ever get a bonus?

23:03.590 --> 23:05.967
Yes, once.

23:06.050 --> 23:09.470
Yeah, the boss hands you
the envelope.

23:09.554 --> 23:13.099
You wonder how much is in it,
and you don't want to open it.

23:13.182 --> 23:15.851
As long as the envelope's
closed, you're a millionaire.

23:15.935 --> 23:19.188
You keep, you keep postponing
that moment and..

23:19.272 --> 23:22.483
...oh, you can't
postpone it forever.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.236
I'm meeting her tonight,
8:30 in a cafe.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.405
- A red carnation?
- Yeah.

23:27.488 --> 23:29.740
Yeah. She's using one
for a bookmark

23:29.824 --> 23:31.826
in a copy of Tolstoy's
"Anna Karenina."

23:31.910 --> 23:33.620
And I'm wearing one in my lapel.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.080
I haven't slept for days.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.456
I'm sure she'll be beautiful.

23:37.540 --> 23:39.041
Well, not too beautiful.

23:39.125 --> 23:40.793
Oh, what chance
would a fellow like me--

23:40.877 --> 23:42.545
What do you want, a homely girl?

23:42.629 --> 23:44.464
No, no.

23:44.547 --> 23:46.298
Now, you-you knock on
wood for me.

23:47.383 --> 23:49.843
Just a lovely, average girl.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.680
That's...that's all I want.

23:52.764 --> 23:55.641
[engine revving]

24:00.063 --> 24:01.689
Thank you, my good man.

24:01.773 --> 24:02.774
Morning, everybody.

24:07.153 --> 24:09.029
Here, my good fellow,
keep the change.

24:09.113 --> 24:10.906
- Send your boy through college.
- Thank you, sir.

24:10.990 --> 24:13.033
Well..

24:13.117 --> 24:14.785
...I can see by the expression
on your underpaid faces

24:14.869 --> 24:16.412
that you wonder
where I get all this money.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.414
No, Mr. Vadas, I don't wonder.

24:18.498 --> 24:20.541
- What do you mean?
- I just mean, I don't wonder.

24:29.258 --> 24:30.759
(all)
Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.

24:34.347 --> 24:36.515
This window looks terrible.

24:36.599 --> 24:37.641
There isn't a shop on the street

24:37.725 --> 24:38.892
that doesn't look better
that this.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.770
It's a wonder we get any
customers.

24:40.853 --> 24:43.230
Well, we'll stay tonight
after closing hours

24:43.314 --> 24:45.357
'and redecorate it.'

24:45.441 --> 24:46.859
I'll have to get out of it
some way.

24:46.943 --> 24:48.361
Oh, Kiara, you haven't
got a chance.

24:48.444 --> 24:50.988
I have a very important
engagement tonight at 8:30.

24:51.072 --> 24:54.241
And I have to go home first.
You see, I have to change.

24:54.325 --> 24:55.826
Ilona, tell me,
did you notice the blouse

24:55.910 --> 24:57.286
I wore yesterday, the green one?

24:57.370 --> 24:58.579
With the light yellow dots?

24:58.663 --> 24:59.747
I thought it was
simply stunning.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.207
Did you, really?
Oh, I'm so glad.

25:01.290 --> 25:03.542
You see, I'm planning
to wear it tonight.

25:03.626 --> 25:05.002
[telephone rings]

25:06.337 --> 25:08.047
Hello?

25:08.131 --> 25:11.509
Oh. Yeah, hello, darling.

25:11.592 --> 25:13.844
Well, you were sleeping, and
I didn't want to disturb you.

25:13.928 --> 25:15.804
You came home late last night.

25:15.888 --> 25:18.265
I thought perhaps you'd like
to sleep a little longer.

25:19.767 --> 25:21.518
No, no. I'm not angry.

25:21.602 --> 25:22.978
Did you have a good time?

25:24.731 --> 25:27.608
Yeah. Well, that's all
that matters, isn't it?

25:29.027 --> 25:29.986
What?

25:30.862 --> 25:33.155
Thousand pengo?

25:33.239 --> 25:35.324
But, Emma,
I don't understand it.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.992
Only last Monday I gave you..

25:38.369 --> 25:39.995
No, no, no.
I'm not complaining.

25:40.079 --> 25:41.747
It's quite a bit of money.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.500
Yeah, well, alright, alright.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.252
I'll s-send it over
as soon as possible.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.546
Yeah, goodbye.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.843
[knock on door]

25:53.926 --> 25:54.927
Come in.

25:59.474 --> 26:00.683
- What is it?
- Mr. Matuschek..

26:00.767 --> 26:02.059
I'd like to
talk to you for a moment.

26:02.143 --> 26:03.269
Well, is it important?

26:03.352 --> 26:05.937
Uh, well, it's important to me.

26:06.022 --> 26:08.441
Is it important
to Matuschek and Company?

26:08.524 --> 26:10.025
- Not exactly, sir.
- Well, then, I'm sorry.

26:10.109 --> 26:12.277
I'm busy.
You'll have to see me later.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.997
- Pardon me, sir.
- Well, what is it now?

26:23.081 --> 26:24.832
Well, sir,
for several days your attitude

26:24.916 --> 26:26.918
toward me seems to have changed.

26:27.001 --> 26:30.129
- Oh. Has it?
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek, it has.

26:30.213 --> 26:32.381
Now, really, I'm completely
at a loss to understand it.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.425
After all, I do my work.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.844
- And you get paid for it?
- Yes, sir.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.930
- Every month?
- Yes, sir.

26:39.013 --> 26:41.724
Yes, well, everything seems to
be alright then, doesn't it?

26:43.059 --> 26:44.393
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

26:51.567 --> 26:52.901
Did you see him?

26:52.985 --> 26:55.153
I'm not going to stand
for this much longer.

26:55.238 --> 26:56.614
What does that man
want of me, anyway?

26:56.697 --> 26:58.365
And why does he always
have to pick on me?

26:58.449 --> 27:00.159
Well, you are
his oldest employee.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.452
Well, that's a fine reason.

27:01.536 --> 27:02.662
He picks on me, too.

27:02.745 --> 27:04.580
The other day
he called me an idiot.

27:04.664 --> 27:05.915
What could I do?

27:05.998 --> 27:07.332
I said, "Yes, Mr. Matuschek

27:07.416 --> 27:09.918
I'm an idiot." I'm no fool.

27:10.002 --> 27:12.504
Listen, maybe he has
business worries.

27:12.588 --> 27:15.465
Or maybe he has some trouble
with his wife.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.260
Is that, uh, true, Pirovitch?

27:17.343 --> 27:19.303
Is he having trouble
with his wife?

27:19.387 --> 27:21.764
I don't, I don't know
it's none of my business.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.516
I'm talking to Kralik.
What do you want?

27:23.599 --> 27:26.059
And I don't know anything.
Leave me alone, please.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.728
Kralik, don't be impulsive.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.396
Not at a time like this.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.690
Not when millions of people
are out of work.

27:31.774 --> 27:33.317
I can get a job anywhere.

27:33.401 --> 27:34.944
Can you? Let's be honest.

27:35.027 --> 27:36.528
Anyway, I'll take a chance.

27:36.612 --> 27:38.905
I'm no coward, you know.
I'm not afraid.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.866
I am. I have a family.

27:40.950 --> 27:41.951
Well, I haven't.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.662
Think it over.

27:44.745 --> 27:46.830
Those were nice letters,
weren't they?

27:50.418 --> 27:52.503
[clattering]

27:57.884 --> 27:59.093
(Novak)
'It's already been paid for.'

27:59.177 --> 28:01.053
Just leave it downstairs
at the desk.

28:01.137 --> 28:03.055
Mr. Kralik, do you think
I'll have to work tonight too?

28:03.139 --> 28:04.723
After all, I'm a child.

28:04.807 --> 28:06.558
- No, you don't have to stay.
- Do you mean it?

28:06.642 --> 28:08.435
Yeah, I'll straighten it out
with Mr. Matuschek.

28:08.519 --> 28:09.645
Thanks, Mr. Kralik!

28:17.570 --> 28:18.904
- May I help you, Mr. Kralik?
- No, thank you.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.572
Oh, no trouble at all.

28:20.656 --> 28:22.240
I put all the imported bags
over there on the shelf.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.576
- Alright.
- Is that how you wanted it?

28:23.659 --> 28:25.452
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

28:25.536 --> 28:27.663
I'd appreciate it if you'd tell
me if there's anything wrong.

28:27.747 --> 28:28.914
Since when have you
become so interested

28:28.998 --> 28:30.332
in my idea of what's wrong?

28:30.416 --> 28:31.708
Well, I want to please you,
Mr. Kralik.

28:31.792 --> 28:33.126
After all,
I'm working under you.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.087
Now, you don't have to keep
harping on that.

28:35.171 --> 28:37.339
Oh, no, I didn't mean it
that way at all, Mr. Kralik.

28:37.423 --> 28:39.049
Regardless of what I think
of you personally

28:39.133 --> 28:40.968
I believe that anybody
who works with you

28:41.052 --> 28:43.637
and doesn't get a great deal
out of it, is just plain dumb.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.934
Just what do you mean? What do
you think of me personally?

28:49.018 --> 28:51.103
Oh, well, I mean

28:51.187 --> 28:52.605
uh, since you ask

28:52.688 --> 28:54.606
no matter what anybody else
says against you

28:54.690 --> 28:56.024
I think you're a gentleman.

28:57.276 --> 28:58.735
Well, I try to be.

28:58.819 --> 29:00.195
And, oh, Mr. Kralik

29:00.279 --> 29:02.447
you have no idea what that means
to a working girl.

29:02.531 --> 29:04.574
What a girl goes through
in some shops.

29:04.659 --> 29:05.701
Now, take for instance
when I was with

29:05.785 --> 29:06.827
Foeldes Brothers and Sons.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.078
Well, the sons were alright

29:08.162 --> 29:10.080
but the brothers, Mr. Kralik..

29:10.164 --> 29:11.582
And that's why I like it here
so much.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.417
When you say, "Miss Novak

29:13.501 --> 29:16.086
let's go into the stockroom
and put some bags on the shelf"

29:16.170 --> 29:18.255
well, you really want
to put some bags on the shelf.

29:18.339 --> 29:21.342
And that's my idea
of a gentleman.

29:21.425 --> 29:24.177
Well, I just don't believe
in mixing bags with pleasure.

29:27.890 --> 29:29.308
- Mr. Kralik.
- Yes, Miss Novak?

29:29.392 --> 29:30.559
About that blouse--

29:30.643 --> 29:32.102
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I had to do that.

29:32.186 --> 29:34.021
But I wanna thank you.
I'm so glad you did it.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.606
You know,
in the bottom of my heart

29:35.690 --> 29:37.483
after thinking it all over,
you're so right.

29:37.566 --> 29:39.401
- That blouse was awful.
- Oh, no, not awful.

29:39.485 --> 29:41.069
Yes, it was!

29:41.153 --> 29:42.737
Of course, I wouldn't
admit it at the time

29:42.822 --> 29:44.782
but what woman would?
We hate to admit we are wrong.

29:44.865 --> 29:45.949
That's why we're so feminine.

29:46.033 --> 29:46.992
Oh. Well..

29:48.661 --> 29:49.745
...you know, this is
the first time you've shown

29:49.829 --> 29:51.580
a little sense.

29:51.664 --> 29:53.123
Quite a change in you,
Miss Novak.

29:53.207 --> 29:54.666
I know it, Mr. Kralik.

29:54.750 --> 29:56.126
Now, if you just
keep this up and I think

29:56.210 --> 29:57.794
we'll be able
to get along much better.

29:57.878 --> 29:58.962
Thank you, Mr. Kralik.

29:59.046 --> 30:00.422
Quite alright, Miss Novak.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.217
You know, I was planning to wear

30:03.301 --> 30:04.844
that awful blouse tonight.

30:04.927 --> 30:07.012
- I have a date with--
- Tonight?

30:07.096 --> 30:08.764
Oh, didn't you hear
what Mr. Matuschek said?

30:08.848 --> 30:10.516
We have to stay here
and decorate the windows.

30:10.599 --> 30:12.392
- Oh! I almost forgot.
- Yes.

30:13.602 --> 30:14.603
Oh..

30:16.439 --> 30:18.607
Uh, would it be possible..

30:18.691 --> 30:20.192
Do you think you could
spare me tonight?

30:20.276 --> 30:22.778
And then maybe Mr. Matuschek
would let me off.

30:22.862 --> 30:24.488
Oh, so that's why
I'm a gentleman.

30:24.572 --> 30:25.823
And that's why you've learned
from me all of a sudden?

30:25.906 --> 30:27.407
I don't understand, Mr. Kralik.

30:27.491 --> 30:29.242
- You want to get the night off?
- I have to, Mr. Kralik.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.578
Well, you're out of luck.

30:30.661 --> 30:32.496
Oh, that was
such an obvious trick.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.123
- I almost fell for it, too.
- Please, Mr. Kralik.

30:34.206 --> 30:36.041
I have to get off tonight.
It's terribly important.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.960
You know, for the last six
months, you've done everything

30:38.044 --> 30:39.879
you could to antagonized me
and now you have the nerve--

30:39.962 --> 30:42.089
You haven't been very nice
to me either.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.465
No matter what I do, it's wrong.

30:43.549 --> 30:45.384
If I wrap a package,
that's not the right way.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.970
If I make a suggestion and
some of them are very good..

30:48.054 --> 30:49.180
- You don't even listen.
- Here.

30:49.263 --> 30:50.973
Everything has to be done
just exactly

30:51.057 --> 30:53.017
your way,
and then you don't like it.

30:53.100 --> 30:54.142
When I first came
into this shop

30:54.226 --> 30:56.478
I was full of life
and enthusiasm

30:56.562 --> 30:58.146
and now I'm nothing!

30:58.230 --> 31:00.106
You've taken
my personality away!

31:00.191 --> 31:02.151
You're a dictator,
that's what you are!

31:02.234 --> 31:03.360
Well, let me tell you,
Mr. Kralik

31:03.444 --> 31:04.903
any day now I may be
in a position

31:04.987 --> 31:06.321
where I don't have
to work anymore.

31:06.405 --> 31:07.406
And then Mr. Kralik, I'll really

31:07.490 --> 31:08.991
tell you what I think of you.

31:09.075 --> 31:10.367
As for that blouse,
I think it's beautiful

31:10.451 --> 31:11.702
and I'm going to wear it
tonight!

31:13.120 --> 31:14.704
Mr. Kralik, I don't like you.

31:17.833 --> 31:19.417
Mr. Matuschek, may I
speak to you for a moment?

31:19.502 --> 31:20.794
Well, what is it?

31:20.878 --> 31:22.546
Would it be possible,
by any chance..

31:22.630 --> 31:24.590
Do you think you could
spare me tonight?

31:24.673 --> 31:26.341
Well, let me see,
we need three people

31:26.425 --> 31:28.093
to dress the "A" window.

31:28.177 --> 31:31.305
- Mr. Kralik?
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.891
Can you get along
without Miss Novak tonight?

31:33.974 --> 31:36.351
Mr. Matuschek, I'd like
to talk to you for a moment.

31:36.435 --> 31:37.853
Oh, you want to go, too?

31:37.937 --> 31:39.521
Well, yes, sir.
I'd appreciate it very much.

31:39.605 --> 31:41.732
What is this? Does everybody
want to leave here?

31:41.816 --> 31:43.692
Is this the interest
you show in my shop?

31:43.776 --> 31:45.277
Once a year, I ask you to stay.

31:45.361 --> 31:47.613
I'm sorry, sir,
if I'd only known yesterday.

31:47.696 --> 31:49.948
Oh, I see.
You want a special invitation.

31:50.032 --> 31:52.159
Well, next time, I'll send you
an engraved announcement.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.577
- Mr. Matuschek?
- Yeah?

31:53.661 --> 31:55.746
I have talked
everything over with Mr. Kralik.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.164
I know his ideas.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.250
And I think Miss Novotni
and I can manage

31:59.333 --> 32:00.876
the novelty window by ourselves.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.795
Did I ask you for your advice?

32:02.878 --> 32:05.005
What do you mean Mr. Kralik
and you talked things over?

32:05.089 --> 32:07.091
- Whose shop is this?
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.511
So you want the evening off,
Mr. Kralik?

32:10.594 --> 32:11.761
Well, that's alright.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.347
I think we can manage
without you.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.099
Mr. Matuschek,
this is the first time in years

32:15.182 --> 32:17.142
I have asked a favor. If it
weren't so very important--

32:17.226 --> 32:18.852
I've given you your evening.
What more do you want?

32:18.936 --> 32:20.228
Do you want a brass band
to see you off?

32:20.312 --> 32:21.771
Mr. Matuschek,
I think you're being unjust!

32:21.856 --> 32:23.148
I'm being unjust?

32:23.232 --> 32:25.609
Once a year, I ask
six ladies and gentlemen

32:25.693 --> 32:27.319
six, mind you,
when next door

32:27.403 --> 32:28.862
a shop twice as big as mine

32:28.946 --> 32:30.405
employs only four!

32:30.489 --> 32:32.157
Oh! Good morning, madam.

32:32.241 --> 32:33.700
Is there something
I can show you?

32:33.784 --> 32:36.161
Have you any traveling bags
for men with a zipper?

32:36.245 --> 32:37.579
Oh, yes, madam,
we have all types

32:37.663 --> 32:39.081
of traveling bags for men
with zippers.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.332
Thank you very much.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.792
I'm just doing a little
window-shopping

32:41.876 --> 32:43.794
for my husband.
He'll be here tomorrow.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.880
Well, I'll be delighted
to serve him, madam.

32:45.963 --> 32:48.090
- Thank you. Good morning.
- Good morning, madam.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.052
Six ladies and gentlemen

32:53.137 --> 32:54.555
who stand around here for days

32:54.638 --> 32:56.473
telling jokes
and talking about the movies

32:56.557 --> 32:57.933
while I pay the gas and the rent

32:58.017 --> 32:59.268
and the light, and the taxes

32:59.351 --> 33:00.518
and their salaries!

33:00.603 --> 33:02.354
[telephone rings]

33:02.438 --> 33:04.022
Good morning.
Matuschek and Company.

33:05.649 --> 33:06.983
What?

33:07.067 --> 33:08.485
Yeah, just a moment.

33:09.570 --> 33:10.529
Mr. Pirovitch!

33:16.368 --> 33:18.828
Yes? Ah, mama. I called you.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.915
Imagine, mama,
we are decorating the window

33:20.998 --> 33:21.957
after closing hours

33:22.041 --> 33:23.375
so, we won't have to have dinner

33:23.459 --> 33:25.294
with the Laszlos.
Isn't that wonderful?

33:25.377 --> 33:27.003
Yes, I knew you'd be glad.

33:27.087 --> 33:28.129
Goodbye, mama.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.469
Six people I ask,
one day a year

33:33.552 --> 33:36.471
to be so kind
as to redecorate a window.

33:36.555 --> 33:38.348
And you have the nerve,
Mr. Kralik

33:38.432 --> 33:39.641
the oldest employee
in the place

33:39.725 --> 33:40.934
who should set an example.

33:41.018 --> 33:42.519
Mr. Matuschek,
you spoke like this

33:42.603 --> 33:44.605
to me yesterday.
What did I do yesterday?

33:44.688 --> 33:46.856
The whole week
you've treated me like this

33:46.941 --> 33:48.609
and without any reason.

33:48.692 --> 33:50.819
Without any reason?

33:50.903 --> 33:52.613
Maybe I have more reason
than you think.

33:54.573 --> 33:57.117
Well, it's obvious that
you're not satisfied with me.

33:57.201 --> 34:00.829
Well, you can draw
your own conclusions.

34:00.913 --> 34:04.166
Well, in that case, I think
there's just one thing to do.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.918
Perhaps we'd better
call it a day.

34:08.087 --> 34:10.047
[telephone rings]

34:10.130 --> 34:11.505
Matuschek and Company.
Good morning.

34:11.590 --> 34:13.091
Oh, yes, Mrs. Matuschek,
he's here.

34:13.175 --> 34:15.342
Mrs. Matuschek on the telephone.

34:15.427 --> 34:17.512
Hello, Emma.

34:17.596 --> 34:19.179
No, no, I'm not
coming home tonight.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.809
Oh. Alright.
Yes, alright, alright.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.978
I'll-I'll-I'll
send it right over.

34:25.062 --> 34:26.438
Yeah.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.565
Uh, just put a 1,000 pengo
in an envelope

34:28.649 --> 34:31.360
and have Pepi take it over
to Mrs. Matuschek right away.

34:31.443 --> 34:33.862
Pepi is out. He has quite a few
packages to deliver

34:33.946 --> 34:35.530
and he won't be back
until after lunch.

34:35.614 --> 34:38.658
Mr. Kralik and I always
have lunch at Farago's.

34:38.742 --> 34:41.161
It's only a few blocks
from your home, Mr. Matuschek.

34:41.245 --> 34:43.413
We can deliver it.
Isn't that right, Mr. Kralik?

34:44.831 --> 34:47.583
- Yes.
- No, thank you, Mr. Kralik.

34:49.587 --> 34:51.672
Oh. Mr. Vadas.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.922
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

34:54.007 --> 34:55.634
I, uh, I don't like

34:55.717 --> 34:57.302
to break in
on your lunch hour.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.971
That's perfectly alright.
It'll be a pleasure.

35:00.055 --> 35:02.057
- Thank you, Mr. Vadas.
- Not at all.

35:05.477 --> 35:08.354
[engine revving]

35:11.984 --> 35:14.861
[clattering]

35:28.542 --> 35:29.834
Mr. Kralik

35:29.918 --> 35:31.294
will you come to my office?

35:31.378 --> 35:33.296
I'd like to talk to you.

35:33.380 --> 35:34.297
Yes, sir.

35:40.220 --> 35:41.346
Good luck, Kralik.

35:49.438 --> 35:50.480
Yes, sir?

35:50.564 --> 35:53.191
Oh, Mr. Kralik, I, uh..

35:53.275 --> 35:54.484
...I've been thinking all day

35:54.568 --> 35:55.860
about what you said
this morning.

35:55.944 --> 35:57.445
Oh, I'm very sorry,
Mr. Matuschek.

35:57.529 --> 35:59.113
I'm afraid I lost my temper.

35:59.198 --> 36:01.033
Oh, no, no, no.
I think you were right.

36:01.116 --> 36:03.326
I...I really believe

36:03.410 --> 36:05.328
that you'd be happier
somewhere else.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.754
Well, you think so, sir?

36:13.837 --> 36:15.255
Yes, I-I'm sure of it.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.298
Uh..

36:21.887 --> 36:23.471
Well, I..

36:23.555 --> 36:25.598
...guess there's nothing more
to be said.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.810
No. Well, let me see.

36:27.893 --> 36:29.561
You're naturally entitled

36:29.645 --> 36:30.812
to a month's pay.

36:30.896 --> 36:33.523
That's 200 pengo.

36:33.607 --> 36:35.358
- That's right, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

36:36.443 --> 36:38.194
Will you, please

36:38.278 --> 36:39.946
sign this receipt?

36:44.535 --> 36:47.829
And here, here's a letter

36:47.913 --> 36:49.873
which certainly
won't handicap you

36:49.957 --> 36:52.125
in seeking employment.

36:52.209 --> 36:53.293
Thank you, sir.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.213
Well, I guess

36:57.297 --> 37:00.550
we might just as well
say goodbye.

37:00.634 --> 37:02.636
- Goodbye, Mr. Matuschek.
- Goodbye.

37:14.356 --> 37:15.273
Well?

37:24.450 --> 37:25.534
What happened?

37:37.921 --> 37:39.380
"To whom it may concern..

37:40.966 --> 37:43.468
"I wish to state
that Mr. Alfred Kralik

37:43.552 --> 37:45.929
"leaves my employ
of his own accord.

37:48.015 --> 37:50.267
"Mr. Kralik started
with Matuschek and Company

37:50.350 --> 37:52.435
"nine years ago
as an apprentice.

37:54.104 --> 37:55.522
"Though with diligence,
he advanced

37:55.606 --> 37:57.107
"to the position of clerk.

37:58.984 --> 38:01.903
"For the last five years,
he has been our first salesman.

38:04.156 --> 38:06.241
"We have found him reliable

38:06.325 --> 38:09.661
"efficient, resourceful.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.705
"We can recommend him
without reserve.

38:13.540 --> 38:15.333
"He carries with him
our best wishes

38:15.417 --> 38:17.627
"for his success
in his future career.

38:20.005 --> 38:21.214
Hugo Matuschek."

38:44.446 --> 38:45.989
Kra..

38:46.073 --> 38:48.825
Kralik, I still
can't believe it.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.744
There's no reason.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.038
Listen, the boss doesn't
have to give you a reason.

38:53.121 --> 38:55.123
That's one of the wonderful
things about being boss.

38:56.708 --> 38:58.251
Well..

38:58.335 --> 38:59.878
...I wanted to get off tonight.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.048
I got off alright.

39:03.131 --> 39:04.924
Kralik, you're not going?

39:05.008 --> 39:07.844
No, I couldn't face her tonight.

39:07.928 --> 39:10.388
You see, this morning
I had a position, a future.

39:11.181 --> 39:12.182
Now..

39:13.141 --> 39:14.392
See, I-I-I'm afraid

39:14.476 --> 39:16.478
I sort of exaggerated
in my letters.

39:16.562 --> 39:19.106
I showed off a little, you know.

39:19.189 --> 39:21.357
She's expecting to meet
a pretty important man.

39:21.441 --> 39:24.360
Well, I'm in no mood
to act important tonight.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.248
Well..

39:37.583 --> 39:38.750
Oh, I, uh..

40:03.483 --> 40:05.526
[clears throat]
My dear Kralik

40:05.611 --> 40:07.029
I think I speak
for all of us, when I say

40:07.112 --> 40:09.572
this is a shock
and a surprise.

40:09.656 --> 40:11.783
We all feel we are losing
a splendid fellow worker

40:11.867 --> 40:13.076
and we certainly
wish you the luck

40:13.160 --> 40:14.786
which you so rightfully deserve.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.542
Now, Kralik

40:20.626 --> 40:22.669
we are going
to see each other soon.

40:22.753 --> 40:25.797
If you have an evening
with nothing to do..

40:25.881 --> 40:26.923
...you know where we live.

40:27.007 --> 40:28.842
Alright, Pirovitch. Goodbye.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.052
Goodbye, Kralik.

40:33.972 --> 40:37.141
Well, Ilona,
I'm going to miss you.

40:37.225 --> 40:39.644
Well, I...I don't understand.

40:39.728 --> 40:41.354
Oh, it's nothing unusual.

40:41.438 --> 40:42.897
It happens every day.

40:42.981 --> 40:45.191
Somebody gets fired and..

40:45.275 --> 40:47.860
- Goodbye, Ilona.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.573
Flora.

40:51.657 --> 40:52.949
Oh, Flora, you'll notice

40:53.033 --> 40:54.367
when you look through
my sales book

40:54.451 --> 40:55.660
I've cancelled slip number five

40:55.744 --> 40:57.495
but I deducted it
from the total. So..

40:58.830 --> 40:59.789
Goodbye.

41:08.173 --> 41:09.757
Ms. Novak, if I had
anything to do

41:09.841 --> 41:11.050
with you not getting
the evening off

41:11.134 --> 41:12.593
I'm sorry. I--

41:12.678 --> 41:14.971
It was my fault anyway
that you got into this trouble.

41:15.055 --> 41:16.556
Please, believe me,
I'm sorry, too.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.725
- That's alright.
- It's true we didn't get along.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.894
- No.
- I guess we fought a lot.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.646
But losing a job
at a time like this

41:22.729 --> 41:23.855
is something you don't wish--

41:23.939 --> 41:25.023
On your worst enemy.

41:25.107 --> 41:26.691
I didn't say that, Mr. Kralik.

41:26.775 --> 41:28.818
Well, let's not quarrel anymore.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.363
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.

41:42.833 --> 41:45.710
[telephone rings]

41:47.337 --> 41:48.254
Yes?

41:49.589 --> 41:50.506
Well?

41:52.676 --> 41:54.594
Oh, you have.

41:56.179 --> 41:59.432
Well, how soon
can you come over here?

41:59.516 --> 42:02.060
Yeah, well..
Well, come right away. I'll..

42:02.144 --> 42:04.437
Right. I'll be waiting here.

42:11.903 --> 42:13.487
Uh, you may all go home.

42:13.572 --> 42:15.448
We'll finish
the windows tomorrow.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.599
- Oh, excuse me. Good night!
- Good night.

42:45.687 --> 42:46.646
[door closes]

42:53.570 --> 42:56.447
[dialing]

43:02.829 --> 43:05.832
Hello? Is this Mrs. Hojas?

43:05.916 --> 43:08.877
This is Mr. Pirovitch,
Mr. Kralik's friend.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.128
Yes, I-I know
he isn't there yet.

43:11.213 --> 43:13.590
Will you please tell him
when he comes

43:13.673 --> 43:16.384
that we are not working tonight,
and I am coming over.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.428
Yes. Thank you.

43:23.642 --> 43:25.727
I hope you don't mind,
Mr. Matuschek.

43:25.811 --> 43:28.188
He probably feels pretty low
tonight, and I thought--

43:28.271 --> 43:30.147
You don't have to explain.

43:30.232 --> 43:32.734
What you do after working hours
is your own business.

43:32.818 --> 43:33.944
Thank you, sir.

43:36.154 --> 43:37.572
You haven't changed your mind

43:37.656 --> 43:39.532
by any chance, Mr. Matuschek?

43:39.616 --> 43:41.034
You've got the evening off,
haven't you?

43:41.118 --> 43:42.452
Well, go home.

43:42.536 --> 43:44.746
He's the best man you had,
Mr. Matuschek.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.289
Why did you let him go?

43:46.373 --> 43:47.624
I warn you, Mr. Pirovitch--

43:47.707 --> 43:49.875
His whole life
he lived in this shop.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.295
He was almost like a son to you.

43:52.379 --> 43:54.172
And you were so proud of him.

43:54.256 --> 43:56.758
You invited him to your home
again and again.

43:56.842 --> 43:59.010
Mr. Pirovitch, you want to keep
your job, don't you?

44:00.387 --> 44:02.263
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

44:02.347 --> 44:04.140
I have a family.

44:04.224 --> 44:05.350
Two children.

44:05.433 --> 44:07.476
In that case,
mind your own business

44:07.561 --> 44:08.770
and go home.

44:09.896 --> 44:11.147
Yes, Mr. Matuschek.

44:17.612 --> 44:19.447
- Goodnight, Mr. Matuschek.
- Goodnight, Mr. Matuschek.

44:19.531 --> 44:20.448
Oh, goodnight.

44:25.453 --> 44:27.496
- Goodnight, Mr. Matuschek.
- Goodnight, Vadas.

44:27.581 --> 44:29.374
Oh, I beg your pardon,
Mr. Matuschek.

44:29.457 --> 44:31.125
I'm, I'm not quite certain

44:31.209 --> 44:33.085
if I delivered
Mrs. Matuschek's message.

44:33.170 --> 44:34.546
She told me when I gave her
the 1,000 pengo

44:34.629 --> 44:36.047
to remind you to call her

44:36.131 --> 44:38.133
in case you change your mind
and don't work tonight.

44:38.216 --> 44:39.425
- Yes, you told -me, Vadas.
- I..

44:40.302 --> 44:41.803
Uh..

44:41.887 --> 44:43.388
You know, Mr. Matuschek

44:43.471 --> 44:45.431
the last time I had the pleasure

44:45.515 --> 44:47.099
to be at your apartment
was several months ago

44:47.184 --> 44:49.686
when you sent me after
your briefcase, you remember?

44:49.769 --> 44:51.187
Today I had a chance
to get a glimpse

44:51.271 --> 44:52.939
of your new dining room set.

44:53.023 --> 44:55.692
- Oh.
- It's exquisite, really.

44:55.775 --> 44:57.026
I can imagine
what it'll look like

44:57.110 --> 45:00.446
with all the lights on
at a dinner party.

45:00.530 --> 45:03.616
- It must be simply stunning.
- Well, thank you, Vadas.

45:03.700 --> 45:05.201
- Goodnight, Mr. Matuschek.
- Goodnight, Vadas.

45:05.285 --> 45:06.327
Goodnight.

45:33.355 --> 45:34.481
[sighs]

45:41.321 --> 45:42.447
[knock on door]

45:49.913 --> 45:51.456
- Good evening, Mr. Matuschek.
- Good evening.

45:52.874 --> 45:53.791
Please.

45:56.753 --> 46:00.923
- So it's true?
- I'm afraid so, Mr. Matuschek.

46:01.007 --> 46:03.467
Here we have a complete record
from our operatives..

46:03.551 --> 46:05.844
...two of our most reliable men.

46:05.929 --> 46:08.181
"Report on Mrs. Emma Matuschek.

46:08.265 --> 46:10.433
"On December 6th, Mrs. Matuschek
left her residence

46:10.517 --> 46:13.978
"on Vales Street, 23,
at 8:45 pm.

46:14.062 --> 46:16.355
"She walked two blocks up
to Karto Street where she

46:16.439 --> 46:17.773
"engaged a taxi.

46:17.857 --> 46:19.441
"At 9:03, the taxi stopped
at the corner

46:19.526 --> 46:21.361
"of Trantor and Bralter Streets.

46:21.444 --> 46:24.780
There, Mrs. Matuschek was joined
by a young man."

46:24.864 --> 46:26.740
Well, Mr. Matuschek,
your suspicion was right.

46:26.825 --> 46:28.868
- It was one of your employees.
- Hm.

46:28.952 --> 46:33.289
Both our operatives identified
him later as Mr. Vadas.

46:33.373 --> 46:36.667
- Vadas?
- Yes.

46:36.751 --> 46:41.130
Uh, Ferencz Vadas.
Danube Place, 56.

46:41.214 --> 46:44.008
There is such a man
in your employ, isn't there?

46:44.092 --> 46:45.676
Yes, yes. Yeah.

46:56.187 --> 46:59.607
Twenty-two years
we've been married.

46:59.691 --> 47:01.859
Twenty-two years
I was proud of my wife.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.655
Well, she..

47:05.739 --> 47:08.742
...just didn't want to
grow old with me.

47:08.825 --> 47:10.493
Oh, if you'll send me your bill

47:10.577 --> 47:11.995
I'll take care of it
immediately.

47:12.078 --> 47:13.662
Oh, thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

47:15.582 --> 47:17.458
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

47:43.651 --> 47:44.693
Good evenin..

47:48.740 --> 47:49.866
[phone ringing]

47:53.119 --> 47:54.829
Hello?

47:54.913 --> 47:58.291
Uh, uh, no, Mrs. Matuschek.
This is Miss Kaczek speaking.

47:58.375 --> 48:00.710
Good evening. Who?

48:00.794 --> 48:04.631
Pepi? No, Pepi isn't back yet.

48:04.714 --> 48:08.634
I see, Mrs. Matuschek.
He did some errands for you.

48:08.718 --> 48:10.803
Oh, you don't say!

48:10.887 --> 48:13.472
He forgot to pick up a bottle of
perfume at Chabot's?

48:13.556 --> 48:15.349
Isn't that too bad!

48:15.433 --> 48:18.477
Yes, I'll give a good scolding
to the little rascal.

48:18.561 --> 48:21.355
Have a good time,
Mrs. Matuschek. Goodnight.

48:43.420 --> 48:46.506
- Mr. Matuschek! Don't do that--
- 'Go away! Go away!â™ª

48:46.589 --> 48:47.715
- 'No, Mr. Matuschek!'
- 'Leave me!'

48:47.799 --> 48:48.925
[glass shatters]

49:01.688 --> 49:03.272
Why don't you go in, Kralik?

49:03.356 --> 49:06.025
I really think you should go in
and keep your date.

49:06.109 --> 49:08.903
Now, Pirovitch, just do me
a favor and deliver my note.

49:08.987 --> 49:11.322
Alright.

49:11.406 --> 49:13.950
Now, Pirovitch, I don't want
to know what she looks like.

49:14.033 --> 49:16.702
Uh, if she's bad looking, I've
had enough bad news for today

49:16.786 --> 49:18.496
and if she's lovely, it'll just
make it more difficult.

49:18.580 --> 49:20.415
- So don't tell me.
- No, I won't.

49:20.498 --> 49:22.374
Now, what's the name
of that book?

49:22.459 --> 49:24.836
- "Anna Karenina," by Tolstoy.
- "Anna Karenina."

49:24.919 --> 49:26.962
Anna.. And a red carnation
as a bookmark.

49:27.046 --> 49:28.213
- Red carnation.
- Uh-huh.

49:28.298 --> 49:30.133
Let me see. Just a minute.

49:35.889 --> 49:38.850
- Do you see anything?
- Not yet. Uh..

49:38.933 --> 49:41.393
- Oh! There's a beautiful girl!
- Really?

49:41.478 --> 49:44.063
- Very beautiful, but no book.
- No book.

49:46.191 --> 49:48.276
Wait a minute.
I think I see it.

49:48.359 --> 49:50.069
- Yeah?
- Right here under the window.

49:50.153 --> 49:52.029
Ye.. Yes.

49:52.113 --> 49:56.117
"A-Anna Karenina by Tolstoy."

49:56.201 --> 49:57.911
- That's right.
- And a carnation.

49:57.994 --> 49:59.954
Uh-huh.

50:00.038 --> 50:04.333
I can't see her face. She's
sitting behind a clothes rack.

50:04.417 --> 50:06.585
There's a cup of coffee
on the table.

50:06.669 --> 50:08.629
- Yeah?
- She's taking a piece of cake.

50:08.713 --> 50:12.007
- Uh-huh.
- Kralik, she is dunking.

50:12.091 --> 50:13.884
- Well, why shouldn't she dunk?
- Alright.

50:13.968 --> 50:16.553
- Alright.
- Alright.

50:16.638 --> 50:17.972
- She is leaning forward now.
- Uh-huh.

50:18.056 --> 50:19.682
She..

50:19.766 --> 50:23.436
- Well, can you see her?
- Yes.

50:23.520 --> 50:26.314
- Is she pretty?
- Very pretty.

50:26.397 --> 50:27.523
She is, huh?

50:29.651 --> 50:31.986
I should say, uh, she looks..

50:32.070 --> 50:36.199
She has a little of the coloring
of, of Kiara.

50:36.282 --> 50:38.367
Kiara?
What, Miss Novak of the shop?

50:38.451 --> 50:40.453
Now, Kralik, you must admit, uh

50:40.537 --> 50:42.372
Kiara's a very good-looking
girl.

50:42.455 --> 50:44.832
And personally, I've always
found her a very likeable girl.

50:44.916 --> 50:47.668
Yeah, well, this is a fine time
to talk about Miss Novak. Now..

50:47.752 --> 50:49.336
Well, if you don't like
Miss Novak

50:49.420 --> 50:51.255
I can tell you right now,
you won't like that girl.

50:51.339 --> 50:53.716
- Why?
- Because it is Miss Novak.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.676
[instrumental music]

51:13.570 --> 51:15.238
Now..

51:15.321 --> 51:17.323
...shall I give the note
to the waiter now?

51:17.407 --> 51:19.033
No.

51:19.117 --> 51:21.744
Well, what do you want to do,
let the poor girl wait?

51:21.828 --> 51:23.496
Oh, why shouldn't Miss Novak
wait for me?

51:23.580 --> 51:26.082
For the last six months
she's fought with me every day.

51:26.165 --> 51:29.293
But still, she wrote those
letters, my friend.

51:31.296 --> 51:34.632
I know. My misfortune.

51:34.716 --> 51:37.719
- Goodbye, Pirovitch.
- Goodbye, Kralik.

51:37.802 --> 51:39.470
Thank you.

51:45.935 --> 51:47.895
Excuse me, miss, please
could I have this chair?

51:47.979 --> 51:51.107
Oh, no! No, you can't!
I-I'm expecting somebody.

51:51.190 --> 51:52.316
He probably should be here
any minute.

51:52.400 --> 51:55.027
That's alright. That's..

51:55.111 --> 51:57.321
Carnation, huh?

51:57.405 --> 51:59.824
A few nights ago we had
a case with roses.

51:59.907 --> 52:02.034
Turned out very nice, very nice.

52:02.118 --> 52:03.536
But once,
about three months ago

52:03.620 --> 52:06.831
we had a very sad case
with gardenias.

52:06.914 --> 52:08.999
She waited all evening
and nobody came.

52:09.083 --> 52:12.169
And when we cleaned the cafe,
underneath one of the tables

52:12.253 --> 52:14.004
we found another gardenia.

52:14.088 --> 52:16.298
You can imagine,
the man must've come in

52:16.382 --> 52:18.133
taken one look at her,
said, "Phooey!"

52:18.217 --> 52:20.344
And threw away his gardenia.

52:20.428 --> 52:21.720
Is your clock a little fast?

52:21.804 --> 52:24.640
My own says 8:27
and yours says 8:31.

52:24.724 --> 52:27.435
Oh, listen, you have nothing
to worry about.

52:27.518 --> 52:29.353
A pretty girl like you! Ha-ha.

52:29.437 --> 52:32.398
If he doesn't come,
I'll put on a carnation myself.

52:32.482 --> 52:34.275
- 'Waiter.'
- Yes, sir.

52:36.194 --> 52:39.071
[mellow music]

53:05.014 --> 53:08.517
- Oh, hello, Miss Novak.
- Oh. Good evening, Mr. Kralik.

53:08.601 --> 53:11.270
Well, quite a coincidence.
I had an appointment here, too.

53:11.354 --> 53:12.813
Why, you haven't seen
Mr. Pirovitch by any chance?

53:12.897 --> 53:14.523
No, no, I haven't.

53:14.607 --> 53:18.277
Alright.
Well, guess I'll wait.

53:18.361 --> 53:20.071
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- Yes, I do.

53:20.154 --> 53:22.739
You know, I have
an appointment, too, Mr. Kralik.

53:22.824 --> 53:25.076
Oh, oh, yes, I remember.
Yes. I..

53:26.786 --> 53:29.288
My, your friend seems to be
a little late.

53:29.372 --> 53:31.499
And I'll thank you
not to be sarcastic.

53:31.582 --> 53:33.917
I know you've had a bad day, and
you probably feel very bitter.

53:34.001 --> 53:36.128
- Still, that's no reason--
- Bitter? Me?

53:36.212 --> 53:37.671
About leaving
Matuschek and Company?

53:37.755 --> 53:39.965
Wh-when I got home
and sat at the phone

53:40.049 --> 53:42.509
in five minutes I had
what amounts to two offers.

53:42.593 --> 53:46.888
Well, I congratulate you.
I wish you good luck.

53:46.973 --> 53:50.518
Oh, I see you're reading
Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina."

53:50.601 --> 53:52.519
- Yes, do you mind?
- No, no.

53:52.603 --> 53:54.938
I just didn't expect
to meet you in a cafe

53:55.022 --> 53:57.524
with Tolstoy, that's all.
It's quite a surprise.

53:57.608 --> 54:00.027
I didn't know you went in
for high literature.

54:00.111 --> 54:03.239
There are many things you don't
know about me, Mr. Kralik.

54:03.322 --> 54:07.576
Uh-huh. H-have you read
"Crime and Punishment"

54:07.660 --> 54:09.662
by Dostoyevsky?

54:09.746 --> 54:11.164
- No, I haven't.
- I have.

54:13.583 --> 54:16.669
There are many things you don't
know about me, Miss Novak.

54:16.753 --> 54:18.671
As a matter of fact,
there might be a lot

54:18.755 --> 54:20.047
we don't know about each other.

54:20.131 --> 54:21.841
You know, people seldom
go to the trouble

54:21.924 --> 54:23.467
of scratching the surface
of things

54:23.551 --> 54:25.219
to find the inner truth.

54:25.303 --> 54:28.389
Well, I really wouldn't care to
scratch your surface, Mr. Kralik

54:28.473 --> 54:30.808
because I know exactly
what I'd find.

54:30.892 --> 54:33.185
Instead of a heart, a handbag.

54:33.269 --> 54:35.938
Instead of a soul, a suitcase.

54:36.022 --> 54:37.523
And instead of an intellect

54:37.607 --> 54:41.110
a cigarette lighter
which doesn't work.

54:43.654 --> 54:46.281
Well, that's very nicely put.

54:46.365 --> 54:48.700
Yes, comparing my intellect

54:48.785 --> 54:52.288
with a cigarette lighter
that doesn't work.

54:52.371 --> 54:56.871
Yeah, that's a very interesting
mixture of poetry and meanness.

54:57.251 --> 54:58.502
- Meanness? Let me--
- Well, now..

54:58.586 --> 55:00.004
Don't misunderstand me,
Miss Novak.

55:00.087 --> 55:01.755
I'm only trying to pay you
a compliment.

55:01.839 --> 55:06.339
Mr. Kralik, please! I told you
I was expecting somebody.

55:06.677 --> 55:09.054
Look, if your party doesn't
show up, would I..

55:09.138 --> 55:11.181
Don't worry about that.
My party will show up.

55:11.265 --> 55:13.767
So you don't have to
entertain me.

55:13.851 --> 55:14.977
Uh-huh.

55:32.036 --> 55:33.787
Have you read Zola's
"Madame Bovary?"

55:33.871 --> 55:35.664
"Madame Bovary" is not by Zola.

55:35.748 --> 55:38.250
Mr. Kralik, are you still here?

55:38.334 --> 55:40.502
Are you deliberately trying
to spoil my evening?

55:40.586 --> 55:42.754
Why do you want to do me harm?
Why do you hate me so?

55:42.839 --> 55:45.132
- I don't hate you.
- Oh! I suppose you love me.

55:45.216 --> 55:47.426
Well, why should I? What've you
done to make me love you?

55:47.510 --> 55:49.970
- I don't want you to love me.
- I don't!

55:51.806 --> 55:54.683
[instrumental music]

56:00.606 --> 56:02.024
Do you know what that tune
reminds me of?

56:02.108 --> 56:05.903
Yes, thank you. Two dozen
unsold cigarette boxes.

56:05.987 --> 56:08.739
No, no, no. Wrong again.

56:08.823 --> 56:11.534
It reminds me of a girl
out of a job.

56:11.617 --> 56:13.493
A very nice girl, too,
I thought.

56:13.578 --> 56:16.330
You thought that.
How you can lie!

56:16.414 --> 56:18.207
Of course that was before you
started to make fun of me

56:18.291 --> 56:22.003
and giving imitations of me
in the locker room.

56:22.086 --> 56:24.546
And I'd like to take this
opportunity, Miss Novak

56:24.630 --> 56:27.090
to inform you that I don't
walk like a duck

56:27.174 --> 56:29.134
and I'm not bowlegged.

56:29.218 --> 56:31.678
- Aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

56:31.762 --> 56:34.306
Well, I have information
to the contrary.

56:34.390 --> 56:35.974
Mr. Vadas assured me
that you have

56:36.058 --> 56:37.350
your trousers specially made.

56:37.435 --> 56:39.145
Well, that's a lie! Mr. Vadas.

56:39.228 --> 56:40.854
So that's the kind
of a man you trust.

56:40.938 --> 56:42.648
I've never been to a tailor
in my life.

56:42.732 --> 56:44.316
If you think I'm bowlegged,
come on out in the sidewalk

56:44.400 --> 56:45.776
and I'll pull up my trousers.

56:45.860 --> 56:46.902
How would you like it
if I started making remarks

56:46.986 --> 56:48.278
about how red your hands are?

56:48.362 --> 56:49.738
- Just exactly what you did.
- Oh, no.

56:49.822 --> 56:51.448
Not until after you started
making fun of my legs.

56:51.532 --> 56:52.950
My hands aren't red at all!

56:53.034 --> 56:55.161
No, after I called your
attention to them.

56:55.244 --> 56:57.120
Now, let me tell you something,
Miss Novak.

56:57.204 --> 56:58.496
You may have very beautiful
thoughts

56:58.581 --> 57:00.165
but you certainly hide them.

57:00.249 --> 57:01.583
As far as your actions
are concerned

57:01.667 --> 57:03.126
you're cold and snippy
like an old maid

57:03.210 --> 57:04.419
and you're gonna have a tough
time getting a man

57:04.503 --> 57:06.046
to fall in love with you.

57:06.130 --> 57:07.714
Ian old maid?

57:07.798 --> 57:10.467
So, no man could fall in love
with me?

57:10.551 --> 57:13.220
Really, Mr. Kralik, you're
getting funnier every minute.

57:13.304 --> 57:16.181
Why, I could show you letters
that would open your eyes.

57:16.265 --> 57:17.599
No, I guess not, you probably

57:17.683 --> 57:19.142
wouldn't understand
what's in them.

57:19.226 --> 57:21.519
They're written by a type of man
so far superior to you

57:21.604 --> 57:23.355
it isn't even funny.

57:23.439 --> 57:25.732
[scoffs] I have to laugh
when I think of you

57:25.816 --> 57:27.192
calling me an old maid.

57:27.276 --> 57:30.028
You! You little
insignificant clerk.

57:31.864 --> 57:33.740
[music continues]

57:44.293 --> 57:46.712
- Goodbye, Miss Novak.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.

57:58.641 --> 58:01.268
Well, doctor, I would say
it's a nervous breakdown.

58:01.352 --> 58:02.603
What do you think?

58:02.687 --> 58:04.188
It appears to be
an acute epileptoid

58:04.271 --> 58:06.439
manifestation and a pan phobic
melancholiac

58:06.524 --> 58:08.526
with some indication
of a neurasthenia cordus.

58:08.609 --> 58:10.569
Is that more expensive
than a nervous breakdown?

58:10.653 --> 58:12.321
Uh, pardon me, Mr. Katona.

58:12.405 --> 58:13.864
Precisely what position
do you hold

58:13.948 --> 58:15.366
with Matuschek and Company?

58:15.449 --> 58:18.452
Well, uh, I would describe
myself as a contact man.

58:18.536 --> 58:20.538
I keep contact between
Matuschek and Company

58:20.621 --> 58:23.582
and the customers...
on a bicycle.

58:23.666 --> 58:25.250
Do you mean, an errand boy?

58:25.334 --> 58:28.170
Doctor, did I call you
a pill-peddler?

58:34.218 --> 58:35.594
- Hello, Mr. Kralik.
- Well, how is he?

58:35.678 --> 58:37.054
I wanna thank you for your
splendid reaction

58:37.138 --> 58:38.973
to my telephone call.
I knew you wouldn't fail us.

58:39.056 --> 58:40.015
- Is it serious?
- Actually..

58:40.099 --> 58:41.225
It was a terrible shock.

58:41.308 --> 58:42.851
Well, I have to get over it.

58:42.935 --> 58:44.811
Now this whole thing must be
kept in strictest confidence.

58:44.895 --> 58:46.271
What I told you over
the telephone is between

58:46.355 --> 58:48.732
the three of us. Me,
Mr. Matuschek, and you. Here.

58:57.199 --> 59:00.785
Ah. Thank you for coming,
Kralik. Thank you.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.037
Sit down.

59:06.083 --> 59:10.378
You, you remember the last time
you came to my house for dinner?

59:10.463 --> 59:14.963
I said that if things go well,
I might take it easier

59:15.134 --> 59:19.634
and maybe by Christmas
make you manager of the shop.

59:20.556 --> 59:23.976
Well, now I have to
take it easier.

59:26.479 --> 59:29.106
Would you care to work
for me again?

59:29.190 --> 59:31.400
- Uh, after--
- No, uh..

59:31.484 --> 59:33.986
Don't even think about it, sir.

59:34.070 --> 59:36.655
Is it possible that I ever
distrusted you?

59:36.739 --> 59:39.199
I.. I hated you.

59:39.283 --> 59:43.245
I-I couldn't stand
your presence anymore.

59:43.329 --> 59:45.831
That's how far jealousy
can drive a man.

59:45.915 --> 59:48.042
No, but that's all over
now, sir. You..

59:50.878 --> 59:55.048
When I, when I first got that
anonymous letter, I laughed.

59:55.132 --> 59:56.675
I..

59:56.759 --> 01:00:01.259
My wife having secret rendezvous
with one of my employees.

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:04.474
My wife! It's-it's..

01:00:04.558 --> 01:00:07.769
Oh, but how could you
suspect me, sir?

01:00:07.853 --> 01:00:11.189
Well, you see, you were
the only one of my employees

01:00:11.273 --> 01:00:15.318
who had been to my home
and you sent my wife flowers

01:00:15.402 --> 01:00:18.446
- But that-that was--
- You don't have to tell me.

01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:23.031
I.. But when that poison gets
into a man's mind, it's-it's..

01:00:23.494 --> 01:00:25.829
[sighs]

01:00:25.913 --> 01:00:29.583
- Just try to understand.
- I do understand, sir.

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:31.293
Yes. Right.

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:40.093
Here. Here are the keys
to Matuschek and Company.

01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:44.973
Thank you, sir.

01:00:51.188 --> 01:00:54.274
Uh.. What shall I do about Mr--

01:00:54.358 --> 01:00:56.401
Vadas? Well, I..

01:00:56.485 --> 01:00:59.237
I want him dismissed
as quietly as possible.

01:00:59.321 --> 01:01:00.822
No, no scandal.

01:01:00.906 --> 01:01:04.326
Don't-don't even mention
the subject to him.

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:06.120
We won't lower ourselves.

01:01:06.203 --> 01:01:07.829
Very good, sir.

01:01:07.913 --> 01:01:09.831
And this is going to be
the biggest Christmas

01:01:09.915 --> 01:01:11.499
in the history
of Matuschek and Company.

01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:13.669
- I know it will.
- Yes, sir. Goodbye.

01:01:13.752 --> 01:01:15.295
Yeah.

01:01:15.379 --> 01:01:17.547
- Uh, Kralik?
- Yes, sir?

01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:21.051
Well, now that
you're the boss, if you

01:01:21.135 --> 01:01:23.470
want to give yourself a raise..

01:01:23.554 --> 01:01:26.598
[chuckles softly] Well, sir,
I'll talk it over with myself

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:28.016
and if I don't ask for
too much money

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.061
I'll give it to myself.
Thank you, sir.

01:01:31.145 --> 01:01:32.729
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:36.859
Well, goodbye, Mr. Matuschek.

01:01:36.942 --> 01:01:39.277
Oh, Pepi, I-I don't know
how to thank you.

01:01:39.361 --> 01:01:41.112
Uh, you saved my life.

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.865
Don't mention it.
It was a pleasure.

01:01:42.948 --> 01:01:45.033
Now if you want anything else,
you know where to reach me.

01:01:45.117 --> 01:01:48.161
I'm still nothing but an errand
boy at Matuschek and Company.

01:01:48.245 --> 01:01:51.289
[chuckling] In other words,
you'd like to be a clerk, huh?

01:01:51.373 --> 01:01:52.916
I wouldn't put it that brutally.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.710
Well, when I get
feeling better--

01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:56.544
Then you might change your mind.

01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:59.381
Besides, who knows how long
you'll have to stay here.

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:01.758
You're a pretty sick man,
Mr. Matuschek.

01:02:01.842 --> 01:02:03.385
This isn't just
an ordinary breakdown.

01:02:03.469 --> 01:02:05.888
Alright, you're a clerk.
Now, go on! Get out of here!

01:02:05.971 --> 01:02:07.764
Thanks, Mr. Matuschek!

01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:12.644
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:19.026 --> 01:02:21.153
My dear Kralik, I think
I speak for all of us

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:23.447
when I say heartiest
congratulations.

01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:25.031
[sighs]
What a load off my mind.

01:02:25.115 --> 01:02:27.117
Now we're all one little
happy family again.

01:02:27.201 --> 01:02:28.827
And Kralik, I want you
to be assured

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.579
of my cooperation
to the fullest extent.

01:02:30.663 --> 01:02:32.665
I want you to be
a great success and..

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.249
Oh, yes. That's right.

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.375
From now on, you are going
to the office.

01:02:35.459 --> 01:02:37.043
- Aren't you?
- That's right.

01:02:37.127 --> 01:02:39.045
Well, if anybody deserves it,
it's you, my boy.

01:02:39.129 --> 01:02:40.672
Uh, nice little ring, isn't it?

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:43.008
I had a little luck
last night, too. Real diamond.

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:45.511
- Mm-hm.
- My grandma gave it to me.

01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:46.970
That's what you get
when you're a good boy.

01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:49.056
Some boys get red apples,
I get diamonds.

01:02:49.139 --> 01:02:50.306
- Good one?
- Yeah.

01:02:50.391 --> 01:02:51.683
By the way, Kralik,
I have some

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:53.477
very unusual ideas
for that new window display.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.019
Well, thank you, Vadas,
I think the rest of us

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:57.606
will take care of the windows
alright.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.109
Right now, I'd like you to go
into the stockroom

01:03:00.192 --> 01:03:02.527
and you know those big suitcases
on the top shelf?

01:03:02.611 --> 01:03:04.112
- Yes. The, uh, black suitcase.
- That's right.

01:03:04.196 --> 01:03:05.864
And then there are the big
brown suitcases.

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:07.532
- On the bottom shelf?
- On the bottom shelf.

01:03:07.616 --> 01:03:10.410
Now, I want you to take all
the big black suitcases

01:03:10.494 --> 01:03:12.412
from the top shelf and move them
to the bottom shelf

01:03:12.496 --> 01:03:13.955
and all the big brown suitcases

01:03:14.039 --> 01:03:15.874
from the bottom shelf
and move them to the top shelf.

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.417
- But Kralik--
- You don't wanna do it?

01:03:17.501 --> 01:03:19.544
I didn't say anything like that.
Of course, I'll do it.

01:03:19.628 --> 01:03:21.671
- Ha-ha. I'm a good soldier.
- Alright, do it right away.

01:03:21.755 --> 01:03:22.922
[chuckles]
Yes.

01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:26.802
- Thank you.
- Alright.

01:03:44.111 --> 01:03:45.695
312-683, please.

01:03:47.906 --> 01:03:49.699
Is this the Atlas Employment
Agency?

01:03:49.783 --> 01:03:52.744
Uh, this is Mr. Katona of
Matuschek and Company speaking.

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.830
We have an opening
for a new errand boy.

01:03:54.913 --> 01:03:56.831
Now see here,
I want an educated

01:03:56.915 --> 01:04:00.126
healthy boy,
good family and no bad habits.

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:02.170
Oh, send me four or five.
I'll look them over.

01:04:02.254 --> 01:04:03.630
And right away, if you please.

01:04:03.714 --> 01:04:05.173
Uh, tell them to ask
for Mr. Katona

01:04:05.257 --> 01:04:07.550
of the sales department.
Alright.

01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:11.138
What's the matter, didn't you
ever see a clerk

01:04:11.221 --> 01:04:12.305
in your life before?

01:04:12.389 --> 01:04:13.890
- Who made you a clerk?
- Yes.

01:04:13.974 --> 01:04:15.809
Who did this dreadful thing?

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:18.145
Listen, folks, I can't give you
the whole story, actually

01:04:18.228 --> 01:04:19.771
and I'm tied up
with my word of honor.

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:21.731
But, uh, if it hadn't been
for me, this place

01:04:21.815 --> 01:04:23.316
would be closed
on account of suicide

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.818
and you'd all be out of a job.

01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:27.070
[telephone ringing]

01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:28.780
Matuschek and Company,
good morning.

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:31.366
Oh, yes, Mrs. Matuschek.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:33.577
Don't miss this, folks.

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.454
Hello, Mrs. Matuschek.

01:04:36.538 --> 01:04:39.499
Yes, this is Pepi speaking.

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:41.918
That's right.

01:04:42.002 --> 01:04:44.921
Oh, I didn't bring you
that bottle of perfume?

01:04:45.005 --> 01:04:46.589
Well, you're never going
to get it!

01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:48.049
What do you think of that?

01:04:48.133 --> 01:04:51.427
Your perfume days
are over, Mrs. M!

01:04:51.512 --> 01:04:54.515
Yes! This is Pepi speaking.

01:04:54.598 --> 01:04:58.685
Oh, you want to speak to
Mr. Matuschek? That's too bad.

01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:02.189
Just at the moment he's up
in a balloon with two blondes.

01:05:02.272 --> 01:05:04.023
Now watch this.

01:05:04.108 --> 01:05:07.611
You wouldn't like to speak
by any chance to Mr. Vadas?

01:05:07.694 --> 01:05:10.405
[laughing]

01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:12.991
That got her.
Draw your own conclusions.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:21.625
You, uh, sent for me, chief?

01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:24.001
Vadas, I'm a little worried
about you.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:25.378
You think you're gonna be
comfortable

01:05:25.462 --> 01:05:26.921
under a former, fellow clerk?

01:05:27.005 --> 01:05:28.798
You know, working under
a younger man?

01:05:28.882 --> 01:05:30.174
Kralik, this is
the age of youth

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:31.843
and I always ride
with the times.

01:05:31.927 --> 01:05:33.678
You're a smart young man
and my hat's off to you.

01:05:33.762 --> 01:05:35.388
Alright, now, let's stop
beating around the bush.

01:05:35.472 --> 01:05:37.140
You know, you and I
never got along.

01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:39.017
- Oh, you really think so?
- Oh, come on, admit it.

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:40.852
- You don't like me.
- I don't?

01:05:40.936 --> 01:05:42.354
Now, wait a minute, Kralik.
Wait a minute.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:43.730
You are the boss.
That's right.

01:05:43.814 --> 01:05:45.857
But I am not going to be
a "yes" man. No, sir.

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:48.193
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to contradict you.

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:50.070
I do like you!

01:05:50.154 --> 01:05:53.282
- Anything else bothering you?
- Yes. I don't like you.

01:05:53.365 --> 01:05:56.284
Uh-huh. Mm.
That's every man's privilege.

01:05:56.368 --> 01:05:58.953
I thank you for being so frank,
now, at least I know my problem

01:05:59.037 --> 01:06:00.830
and it's entirely up to me
to make you change your mind.

01:06:00.914 --> 01:06:03.374
And you know, I don't think
it'll be so very hard.

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:06.295
No.. Kralik, I heard the
funniest joke last night.

01:06:06.378 --> 01:06:07.337
- Do you want to hear it?
- No!

01:06:07.421 --> 01:06:09.464
[telephone ringing]

01:06:09.548 --> 01:06:10.882
Hello!

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.926
Yes, this is
Matuschek and Company.

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:16.346
Who's call.. Johanna?

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:18.932
You're calling for Miss Novak.

01:06:19.016 --> 01:06:20.851
What's the matter with her?

01:06:20.934 --> 01:06:23.561
Well, I hope
it's nothing serious.

01:06:23.645 --> 01:06:25.521
Oh, fine, I'm glad to hear that.

01:06:25.606 --> 01:06:26.690
Alright, now,
tell her not to worry.

01:06:26.773 --> 01:06:27.940
Unless she's absolutely alright

01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:29.693
tell her not to come today.

01:06:29.776 --> 01:06:31.861
[stammers]
No, there's no hurry now.

01:06:31.945 --> 01:06:33.863
And tell her to be sure and
take good care of herself.

01:06:33.947 --> 01:06:35.531
Alright.

01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:37.492
Really, Kralik, that's a,
that's a wonderful attitude.

01:06:37.576 --> 01:06:39.452
- What's so wonderful about it?
- Well..

01:06:39.536 --> 01:06:41.454
After all, I've been around, you
know, and I have my eyes open.

01:06:41.538 --> 01:06:42.997
If anyone didn't agree with you
around here, it certainly was

01:06:43.081 --> 01:06:44.123
nobody else but Miss Novak.

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:45.792
Just leave Miss Novak
out of this.

01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:47.002
Alright, alright, I..
Please don't misunderstand me.

01:06:47.085 --> 01:06:48.836
I-I have nothing against
Miss Novak.

01:06:48.921 --> 01:06:50.589
On the contrary, I think she's
a very, very nice girl.

01:06:50.672 --> 01:06:52.006
Only sometimes, you know,
she went a little bit too far.

01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:53.674
- Don't you think?
- Alright. Now just..

01:06:53.759 --> 01:06:55.343
We don't want to have another
word about Miss Novak.

01:06:55.427 --> 01:06:56.928
She's a fine girl and she's
working very hard

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.930
and she's a good salesgirl,
and you shut up!

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:00.432
Y-you misunderstand me.
I didn't..

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:01.642
I didn't mean any offense,
as a matter of fact

01:07:01.725 --> 01:07:02.934
I was agreeing with you--

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:05.562
I don't want you
to agree with me!

01:07:05.646 --> 01:07:07.648
- You're fired.
- Oh. So I'm fired--

01:07:07.731 --> 01:07:09.941
You're fired, now, get out of
here, you two-faced

01:07:10.025 --> 01:07:11.609
double-crossing, two-timer!
Now, go on.

01:07:11.693 --> 01:07:14.612
- Get out of here!
- Folks! Folks!

01:07:14.696 --> 01:07:17.281
Folks!
Did you hear what he called me?

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:19.201
I want you to remember it,
on the witness stand.

01:07:19.284 --> 01:07:20.952
He called me a double-crossing
two-timer!

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.287
A double-crossing
two-timer!

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:23.622
Alright, now, I told you
to get out of here!

01:07:23.705 --> 01:07:25.456
Now, go on. Get out!

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:27.584
Don't you push. Don't you push!

01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:29.044
What right have you got
to fire me anyway?

01:07:29.127 --> 01:07:30.461
Does Mr. Matuschek know
about this?

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:31.922
No! What do you think of that?

01:07:32.005 --> 01:07:33.548
Mr. Matuschek doesn't know
anything about this.

01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:34.841
I'm the manager, and you
don't work here anymore!

01:07:34.925 --> 01:07:36.676
So, you are the manager?

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.344
How do I know you're the
manager? Anyone can say that.

01:07:38.428 --> 01:07:40.138
Prove it to me. Prove it to me
in black and white.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:41.431
Oh, you want it in black
and white? Alright!

01:07:41.515 --> 01:07:43.892
You're gonna get it
in black and blue.

01:07:45.769 --> 01:07:48.646
[instrumental music]

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:58.031
Alright! Alright. Nice little
case of assault and battery.

01:07:58.115 --> 01:08:00.575
You'll hear from my lawyer.
What about my salary?

01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:03.286
Get the man's salary.

01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:05.497
- Here it is, Mr. Vadas.
- We have everything prepared.

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:06.873
We don't want to waste any time.

01:08:06.957 --> 01:08:08.166
Pardon me, sir. Your garments.

01:08:09.459 --> 01:08:11.252
You.. By the way..

01:08:11.336 --> 01:08:12.754
I'm entitled to
a letter of reference.

01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:15.298
I forgot it.
Flora, take a letter.

01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:18.343
Uh.. To whom it may concern.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.053
Mr. Vadas has been in the employ

01:08:20.136 --> 01:08:21.846
of Matuschek and Company
for the last two years

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:23.680
during which time he has been
very efficient

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:25.933
as a stool pigeon,
a troublemaker, and a rat.

01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:27.144
And if he doesn't clear out of
here

01:08:27.227 --> 01:08:28.685
he's get a punch in the nose.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.395
Your very truly, Alfred Kralik

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:32.564
Manager of Matuschek
and Company.

01:09:06.892 --> 01:09:08.018
[knocking on door]

01:09:11.438 --> 01:09:13.314
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Novak.

01:09:14.858 --> 01:09:18.069
Well, I suppose you're surprised
to see me back.

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:20.863
Naturally. I'm glad
you have your job back again.

01:09:20.947 --> 01:09:22.406
I congratulate you.

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:24.242
I hear you haven't been
feeling well.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:28.826
Oh, that's alright, thank you.
I wanted to see Mr. Matuschek.

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:32.125
Uh.. Uh..

01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:36.671
Well, here he is.
Uh, I'm Mr. Matuschek.

01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:39.090
Mr. Kralik, don't make
any jokes. Not today.

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:42.468
Please, if you want to pick
on me, do it some other time.

01:09:42.551 --> 01:09:45.429
Well, I-I don't know
what to say. I..

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.349
I've been trying to tell you
that Mr. Matuschek

01:09:47.432 --> 01:09:49.100
isn't here, and I'm the manager.

01:09:49.184 --> 01:09:50.894
Haven't you got
any heart at all?

01:09:50.977 --> 01:09:53.270
Can't you see I'm not well?
I can hardly see straight.

01:09:53.354 --> 01:09:56.232
This room, everything is just
going round and round.

01:09:56.316 --> 01:09:58.318
In this state of mind,
I ask you a simple question

01:09:58.402 --> 01:10:00.237
and instead of having
any consideration for me

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.946
you just try deliberately
to frighten me.

01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:03.906
[telephone ringing]

01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.991
Excuse me.

01:10:07.828 --> 01:10:10.038
Hello.

01:10:10.122 --> 01:10:11.498
Mr. Foeldes?

01:10:11.581 --> 01:10:13.666
Oh! Hello, Mr. Foeldes.

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.918
Yes. Well, thank you very much.

01:10:16.002 --> 01:10:18.337
Yes, yes, it all happened
this morning.

01:10:18.422 --> 01:10:20.882
Uh-huh.
That's right, Mr. Foeldes.

01:10:20.966 --> 01:10:23.635
No, Mr. Matuschek won't be
with us for a while.

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:26.930
Mm, well.. Oh, well,
now please, Mr. Foeldes.

01:10:27.013 --> 01:10:29.056
I-I don't own the shop yet.

01:10:29.141 --> 01:10:31.143
I'm only the manager, you know.

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:34.312
Yes. Oh, goodbye, Mr..

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:37.690
Miss Novak! Kiara! Kiara!
Miss Novak.

01:10:44.865 --> 01:10:47.617
- Good evening, Miss Novak.
- Good evening, Mr. Kralik.

01:10:47.701 --> 01:10:51.246
I hope you'll forgive this
intrusion, but I..

01:10:51.329 --> 01:10:54.707
Being in charge of the shop,
I feel more as like a father

01:10:54.791 --> 01:10:57.001
to our little family, I..

01:10:57.085 --> 01:10:58.836
And I, uh..

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:02.924
Anyway, uh,
how are you, young lady?

01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:07.095
I'll be alright, Mr. Kralik.
Please sit down.

01:11:07.179 --> 01:11:08.346
Thank you.

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.477
You know, Christmas is coming
soon and we're certainly

01:11:14.561 --> 01:11:16.854
going to miss a good, little
worker like you in the shop.

01:11:16.938 --> 01:11:18.481
So, you better get well.

01:11:18.565 --> 01:11:20.358
I'm sure I'll be alright
in a day or two.

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.402
But that doesn't mean that you
should neglect yourself.

01:11:22.486 --> 01:11:25.280
Now, I-I'm very serious
about this..

01:11:25.363 --> 01:11:26.822
...because I-I feel
more or less

01:11:26.907 --> 01:11:28.199
responsible for the whole thing.

01:11:28.283 --> 01:11:29.867
- You?
- Yes. I..

01:11:29.951 --> 01:11:33.871
Oh, no, Mr. Kralik. Oh, no.
I think I can relieve your mind.

01:11:33.955 --> 01:11:36.248
It wasn't your fault at all.

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:40.833
No, there's a much bigger
reason, unfortunately.

01:11:42.255 --> 01:11:44.173
Well, don't you think
you oughta call a doctor?

01:11:44.257 --> 01:11:46.217
No, I don't need
to see a doctor.

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:50.801
No, my trouble is what
one might call...psychological.

01:11:51.223 --> 01:11:53.058
Oh. Uh-huh.

01:11:53.141 --> 01:11:57.562
Well, it's my own personal
problem and I'll come out of it.

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:59.814
Oh, I'm sorry. It's..

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:02.734
It's a shame you have to
go through all this.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:05.862
Of course, as long as it's only
psychological, you won't..

01:12:05.946 --> 01:12:09.115
Only psychological!

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:13.699
Mr. Kralik, it's true
we're in the same room

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:15.997
but we're not
in the same planet.

01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:20.752
Miss Novak, I..

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:24.381
Although I'm the victim
of your remark

01:12:24.464 --> 01:12:27.133
I can't help but admire
the exquisite way

01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:29.177
you have of expressing yourself.

01:12:31.388 --> 01:12:35.100
You certainly know how
to put a man in his planet.

01:12:35.183 --> 01:12:36.684
Aunt Anna has something for you!

01:12:36.768 --> 01:12:38.186
She has? Well, why doesn't
she come in?

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:39.479
Come in, Aunt Anna!

01:12:40.564 --> 01:12:42.357
Oh.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.984
Oh, uh, this is Mr. Kralik
of Matuschek and Company.

01:12:45.068 --> 01:12:46.527
- I'm glad to meet you.
- How do you do?

01:12:46.611 --> 01:12:48.904
- I hope it's good news.
- I'll tell you later.

01:12:52.742 --> 01:12:54.535
Oh. W-well, Mr. Kralik

01:12:54.619 --> 01:12:56.329
it certainly was kind
of you to drop in.

01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:58.039
But I don't wanna spoil
your whole evening.

01:12:58.123 --> 01:13:01.126
I have nothing to do. No. Go
right ahead and read the letter.

01:13:01.209 --> 01:13:02.627
Don't, don't worry about me.

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:04.796
- 'If you don't mind.'
- No, not at all.

01:13:14.639 --> 01:13:15.765
[chuckles]

01:13:30.697 --> 01:13:34.117
- Good news?
- Very good news.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.409
Mr. Kralik, I can promise you

01:13:35.493 --> 01:13:36.494
I'll be back in the shop
tomorrow

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:37.912
and I'll be on my toes!

01:13:37.996 --> 01:13:40.081
I'll sell more goods
than I ever sold before.

01:13:40.165 --> 01:13:43.293
Well!
That's quite a change in you.

01:13:43.376 --> 01:13:45.586
It's amazing
what one letter can do.

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:46.962
You know, if I weren't
feeling so happy

01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:48.298
I'd be very annoyed with you.

01:13:48.381 --> 01:13:51.050
With me? Why?

01:13:51.134 --> 01:13:53.678
Why? Because you really spoiled
my date last night.

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.346
You see, I wasn't so wrong
when I asked you

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.848
not to sit at my table.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:58.433
This gentleman did come
to the cafe.

01:13:58.516 --> 01:14:00.726
He looked in the window,
saw us together

01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:02.853
and misunderstood.

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.522
Oh, he thought
you and I were friends?

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:05.940
He must have. Listen.

01:14:08.276 --> 01:14:11.362
"Tell me and be frank.
I think you owe it to me.

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:13.948
"Who is this
very attractive young man?

01:14:14.032 --> 01:14:17.076
He's just the type
women fall for."

01:14:20.288 --> 01:14:21.414
[laughter]

01:14:23.124 --> 01:14:25.126
I'm sorry I caused you
so much trouble.

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.629
Oh, it's alright.
I'll straighten it out.

01:14:27.712 --> 01:14:30.047
It won't hurt him
to be a little jealous.

01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:35.095
He doesn't seem to be much of
a man, this friend of yours.

01:14:35.178 --> 01:14:36.596
I mean, he walks away.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.764
He's afraid to come over
to the table

01:14:37.847 --> 01:14:39.557
when another man
is sitting there.

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:43.519
No, Mr. Kralik, he's was not
afraid, I can assure you.

01:14:43.603 --> 01:14:46.689
He's tactful. He's sensitive.

01:14:46.773 --> 01:14:48.441
He's not the type of man
who would walk up

01:14:48.525 --> 01:14:50.235
to a table uninvited.

01:14:50.318 --> 01:14:52.486
Well, it's difficult to explain
a man like him

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:54.488
to a man like you.

01:14:54.572 --> 01:14:57.157
Where you would say, "Black,"
he would say, "White."

01:14:57.242 --> 01:15:01.663
Where you would say, "Ugly,"
he says, "Beautiful."

01:15:01.746 --> 01:15:04.999
And where you say, "Old maid,"
he says..

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:09.583
[murmurs] "Eyes that
sparkle with fire and mystery."

01:15:10.463 --> 01:15:13.716
[murmurs]
"Vivacious."

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.094
[murmurs]
"Fascinating."

01:15:17.178 --> 01:15:18.304
[giggles]

01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:22.392
I remind him of gypsy music.

01:15:24.769 --> 01:15:28.397
Speaking of gypsy music,
we've had a lot of trouble

01:15:28.481 --> 01:15:29.982
selling those Ochi Tchornya
boxes, haven't we?

01:15:30.066 --> 01:15:31.525
Oh, well, that doesn't make any
difference.

01:15:31.609 --> 01:15:33.861
Mr. Kralik, you can consider
one box definitely sold.

01:15:33.945 --> 01:15:36.197
Yes. I've just had an
inspiration.

01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:38.700
I'm going to give
one of my friend for Christmas.

01:15:38.783 --> 01:15:42.536
Oh, Miss Novak, now, you're
taking an awful chance. Oh, yes.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:45.080
Why don't you give him a,
um, wallet?

01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:46.624
Oh, I'm sure he'd be
crazy about it.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:49.127
Any man would be. A wallet
is a very practical thing.

01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:50.920
And besides, we have those
new imported pig skins--

01:15:51.004 --> 01:15:52.296
Oh, no, no, I'm not interested.

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.465
I'd make you a special price.

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:57.301
No, I'm sorry.

01:15:57.385 --> 01:15:59.929
You know, besides
being a very practical thing

01:16:00.013 --> 01:16:03.766
a, a wallet is quite romantic.

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:06.102
You see, on one side,
he has your last letter

01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:08.855
on the other side,
a picture of you.

01:16:08.938 --> 01:16:11.899
And when he opens it,
there you are.

01:16:11.983 --> 01:16:13.693
And that's all the music
he wants.

01:16:15.945 --> 01:16:20.115
Why, Mr. Kralik,
you surprise me.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.368
That's very well-expressed.

01:16:23.828 --> 01:16:27.414
Yes, I must admit,
that's very nice.

01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:30.043
No, just the same, I'm gonna
give him a cigarette box.

01:16:32.587 --> 01:16:36.382
Well, I guess there isn't
much more I can say.

01:16:36.466 --> 01:16:38.593
Except that I wish you a
Merry Christmas. Both of you.

01:16:38.676 --> 01:16:40.678
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Kralik.
- Goodnight, Miss Novak.

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:42.180
Goodnight, Mr. Kralik.

01:16:54.067 --> 01:16:56.819
- Rudy!
- Yes, Mr. Katona?

01:16:56.903 --> 01:16:59.155
- Do you know what time it is?
- A few minutes after 8:00.

01:16:59.239 --> 01:17:00.531
- And you're still here?
- Well, I was just--

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:02.033
Don't contradict me,
just listen!

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.743
Yes, Mr. Katona.

01:17:03.827 --> 01:17:06.371
You have to be faster,
especially on a day like this.

01:17:06.454 --> 01:17:08.873
It's Christmas Eve, young man.

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:10.208
Am I asking too much?

01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:11.917
- No, Mr. Katona.
- Alright.

01:17:16.172 --> 01:17:17.923
Folks, I have great news for ya.

01:17:18.007 --> 01:17:20.009
I talked to the hospital, and
Mr. Matuschek is much better.

01:17:20.093 --> 01:17:22.929
- Oh! That's wonderful!
- Well, can we visit him?

01:17:23.012 --> 01:17:24.096
Oh, let's all get together
and buy him

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.639
a nice Christmas present.

01:17:25.723 --> 01:17:27.266
I have a suggestion,
let's get him a cute little

01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:29.018
Christmas tree
for his hospital room.

01:17:29.102 --> 01:17:30.561
Well, that's all very nice,
but I think the biggest

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:32.021
Christmas present
we could give him tonight

01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:33.564
is an empty bare-looking shop

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:35.316
with nothing in it except money
in the cash register.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.859
Now, now, come on, folks!

01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:38.277
Let's make this the biggest
Christmas Eve

01:17:38.361 --> 01:17:39.612
in the history
of Matuschek and Company.

01:17:39.696 --> 01:17:41.114
[clamoring]

01:17:41.197 --> 01:17:45.034
Where's Kiara? Kiara! Kiara!
Miss Novak!

01:17:45.118 --> 01:17:47.286
Coming! Coming! Yes, Mr. Kralik,
what is it?

01:17:47.370 --> 01:17:50.289
- H-h-how are you today?
- Fine.

01:17:50.373 --> 01:17:52.625
Good. Now, we're expecting
a terrific business today.

01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:55.586
And it's going to be tough.
But don't overdo it.

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:11.269
Now, Miss Novak, I wonder if I
could ask a little favor of you?

01:18:11.352 --> 01:18:13.312
With pleasure, Mr. Pirovitch.

01:18:13.396 --> 01:18:16.899
I wanted to buy one of those
Ochi Tchornya boxes, but Kralik

01:18:16.983 --> 01:18:20.403
tells me you took the only one
that really works.

01:18:20.486 --> 01:18:24.823
That's right. I bought it
for my boyfriend.

01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:26.701
Oh! Ah!

01:18:26.784 --> 01:18:27.910
He's coming tonight.

01:18:27.994 --> 01:18:29.954
We're going to celebrate
Christmas Eve.

01:18:31.748 --> 01:18:34.167
Mr. Pirovitch,
can you keep a secret?

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:35.876
On my word of honor.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.337
Well, when I come back Monday,
I..

01:18:38.421 --> 01:18:41.215
...I might have a ring
on my finger.

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:43.050
Maybe, you never know.

01:18:43.134 --> 01:18:44.802
What? That's wonderful!

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:47.054
And that's the young man
who'll get the cigarette box?

01:18:47.138 --> 01:18:48.347
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

01:18:48.431 --> 01:18:49.890
Then let's drop the whole thing.

01:18:49.974 --> 01:18:51.433
You see, I thought
of giving it, uh

01:18:51.517 --> 01:18:52.935
to my wife's uncle
for Christmas.

01:18:53.019 --> 01:18:54.979
I'm so sorry, can't you give him
something else?

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:59.442
Uh, it's not so easy.
You see, I don't like him.

01:18:59.525 --> 01:19:01.777
I hate to spend a nickel on him.

01:19:01.861 --> 01:19:03.153
Still, I must
give him a present.

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:05.406
So I thought if I have
to give him a present

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:07.992
at least give him something
he won't enjoy.

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:10.536
The box costs 2.29.
That's a lot of money.

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:13.706
But it's worth it to ruin
my wife's uncle's Christmas.

01:19:16.459 --> 01:19:20.959
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Novak.
I forgot you always liked those.

01:19:21.547 --> 01:19:24.758
Oh, no, no, Mr. Pirovitch.
Speak freely.

01:19:24.842 --> 01:19:28.428
Tell me, if, uh,
you were in my position

01:19:28.513 --> 01:19:30.431
what would you give him?

01:19:30.515 --> 01:19:33.184
That's hard to say.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:34.811
What would you say
to the idea of

01:19:34.894 --> 01:19:39.394
uh, well, let's say,
maybe, a wallet?

01:19:40.316 --> 01:19:41.942
That's an inspiration.

01:19:42.026 --> 01:19:44.820
Uh, you mean, uh, one of those
imported pig skins?

01:19:44.904 --> 01:19:48.449
- That's what I was thinking of.
- You can't miss.

01:19:48.533 --> 01:19:51.160
If I would get such a wallet,
I would be

01:19:51.244 --> 01:19:53.913
one of the happiest men
in the world.

01:19:53.997 --> 01:19:57.709
On one side..
Oh, here, I'll show you.

01:19:57.792 --> 01:20:01.003
See, on one side,
I put a picture of my wife

01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:04.131
and on the other side,
my little baby.

01:20:04.215 --> 01:20:06.842
When I open it,
it says, "Papa"

01:20:06.926 --> 01:20:08.344
and not Ochi Tchornya.

01:20:08.428 --> 01:20:10.638
[laughter]

01:20:10.722 --> 01:20:12.557
Thank you very much,
Mr. Pirovitch.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.224
I'll think it over.

01:20:18.563 --> 01:20:20.815
Kralik, you'll get the wallet.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:27.863
[crowd clamoring]

01:20:35.038 --> 01:20:36.622
[cash register machine clinking]

01:20:37.874 --> 01:20:39.458
[indistinct chatter]

01:20:44.714 --> 01:20:46.632
[cash register machine clinking]

01:21:00.563 --> 01:21:01.522
[clinking]

01:21:04.233 --> 01:21:06.193
Well, Mr. Matuschek,
what are doing here?

01:21:06.277 --> 01:21:07.820
Since when are you back?

01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:10.281
Oh, I'm not here, I'm supposed
to be a pretty sick man

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:12.200
that's what my doctor tells me.

01:21:12.283 --> 01:21:13.742
But after all,
it's Christmas Eve.

01:21:13.826 --> 01:21:16.161
I couldn't stay away any longer.

01:21:16.245 --> 01:21:18.872
Can you imagine me, over two
weeks in the hospital

01:21:18.956 --> 01:21:20.874
without seeing
a single customer?

01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:22.459
And the only piece
of leather goods

01:21:22.543 --> 01:21:24.628
in the place
was my nurse's handbag.

01:21:24.712 --> 01:21:26.672
And where do you think
she got it?

01:21:26.756 --> 01:21:28.382
At Blasek and Company!

01:21:28.466 --> 01:21:30.509
And they expect me to get well?

01:21:30.593 --> 01:21:32.761
Have you been
by Blasek and Company?

01:21:32.845 --> 01:21:34.137
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:35.723
What kind of business
are they doing?

01:21:35.807 --> 01:21:38.726
Well, they're pretty busy,
but no comparison with this.

01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:41.020
Ah, good.
This is alright, huh?

01:21:41.104 --> 01:21:43.940
Now Mr. Matuschek,
take it easy. Don't overdo.

01:21:44.023 --> 01:21:47.443
Oh, no, I'm not, don't be.
I'm not a fool.

01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:50.530
I just came around to find out
if the shop was still here.

01:21:50.613 --> 01:21:52.239
[laughs]
And then I go.

01:21:52.323 --> 01:21:53.991
Well, Merry Christmas,
Mr. Matuschek.

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:55.534
Same to you.

01:21:55.618 --> 01:21:57.786
Do you think Eric
would like that briefcase?

01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:00.247
I don't know. I'm not so sure.

01:22:00.331 --> 01:22:03.459
Oh, uh, pardon me, ladies,
I-I can't see very well

01:22:03.543 --> 01:22:05.002
without my glasses.

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:07.171
Could you tell me the price
on that briefcase?

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:08.589
24.50.

01:22:08.673 --> 01:22:13.173
24.50! My, what values
you get here, eh?

01:22:13.469 --> 01:22:15.846
I wonder how Matuschek
and Company can do it.

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:19.350
Well, if you don't know,
Mr. Matuschek, who should?

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:20.643
Uh..

01:22:23.604 --> 01:22:25.480
[clinking]

01:22:28.985 --> 01:22:30.403
Well, how much is it?

01:22:33.573 --> 01:22:36.659
Nine thousand six hundred fifty
four and seventy five.

01:22:36.742 --> 01:22:39.453
- Oh!
- That's wonderful.

01:22:39.537 --> 01:22:41.580
That's the biggest day
since '28.

01:22:41.664 --> 01:22:43.791
You-you should be very proud.

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:47.879
And I, I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:51.131
Two hours ago when I walked
in here, I was a sick man.

01:22:51.215 --> 01:22:54.259
But you, Kralik,
and you, Pirovitch

01:22:54.343 --> 01:22:57.095
you're the best doctors.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:00.308
And you, Kiara and Ilona
and Flora

01:23:00.391 --> 01:23:01.934
you're wonderful nurses.

01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:03.519
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:23:03.603 --> 01:23:06.939
Oh! Well, Pepi, you know
what I think about you.

01:23:07.023 --> 01:23:08.566
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

01:23:08.649 --> 01:23:11.234
Well, this morning
when I received

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:14.989
the little Christmas tree
that you all sent me

01:23:15.072 --> 01:23:16.490
I was deeply moved.

01:23:16.574 --> 01:23:19.868
I-I read your little note
over and over.

01:23:19.952 --> 01:23:23.580
And it made me very happy
that you missed me

01:23:23.664 --> 01:23:27.209
and hoped that I'd be
coming back home soon again.

01:23:28.711 --> 01:23:32.923
You're right, this is my home.

01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:36.010
This is where I spent
most of my life.

01:23:37.803 --> 01:23:41.765
Well, now, no Christmas
is complete without a bonus.

01:23:41.849 --> 01:23:43.392
Am I right?

01:23:43.476 --> 01:23:45.394
[laughs]

01:23:45.478 --> 01:23:48.731
- Mr. Kralik.
- Thank you, sir.

01:23:48.814 --> 01:23:52.067
- Kiara.
- Oh, Mr. Matuschek. Thank you.

01:23:52.151 --> 01:23:54.987
- Pepi.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

01:23:55.071 --> 01:23:56.947
Flora. Here.

01:23:59.116 --> 01:24:02.577
- Ilona.
- Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

01:24:02.662 --> 01:24:06.082
And Pirovitch. You, uh..

01:24:06.165 --> 01:24:10.127
You know that I've called you
names on several occasions.

01:24:10.211 --> 01:24:12.713
Well, when you see the bonus,
you'll realize

01:24:12.797 --> 01:24:14.590
that I didn't mean it.

01:24:14.674 --> 01:24:17.093
Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

01:24:17.176 --> 01:24:20.012
Well, I guess that's about all.

01:24:20.096 --> 01:24:23.849
Oh! Uh, here, uh,
what's your name?

01:24:23.933 --> 01:24:25.100
Rudy.

01:24:25.184 --> 01:24:27.936
- Oh, well, Rudy.
- Good boy.

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:31.940
- Here. There. There.
- Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

01:24:32.024 --> 01:24:34.443
Oh, it's alright, Rudy.

01:24:36.195 --> 01:24:37.196
Too much.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.990
We'll leave the shop just

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:40.783
as it is till after the holiday.

01:24:40.866 --> 01:24:44.786
I-I want you all to go home now
and have a very Merry Christmas.

01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:46.746
- Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
- Thank you.

01:24:49.542 --> 01:24:54.042
Well, Kralik, 9,654 and 75.

01:24:55.965 --> 01:24:57.341
[laughs]
That's wonderful.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:59.260
- Wonderful.
- Thank you, sir.

01:24:59.343 --> 01:25:02.554
Oh, thank you, Flora.
Thank you.

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:09.019
- There you are, sir.
- So..

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:12.439
Well, I think I'll have a..

01:25:12.523 --> 01:25:16.652
...little dinner now,
and celebrate Christmas.

01:25:16.736 --> 01:25:18.863
Uh..
Have you ever been to Biro's?

01:25:18.946 --> 01:25:21.239
Oh, no sir, I'm afraid
that's way over my head.

01:25:21.324 --> 01:25:24.160
Oh, well, but Christmas only
comes once a year.

01:25:24.243 --> 01:25:26.203
[laughs]
How about joining me

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:29.248
and we'll break a bottle
of champagne together?

01:25:29.332 --> 01:25:31.876
Mr. Matuschek, I-I'd love
nothing more but I--

01:25:31.959 --> 01:25:34.002
Oh, you-you have another
engagement, huh?

01:25:34.086 --> 01:25:35.337
Well, it-it's just a--

01:25:35.421 --> 01:25:37.172
No, no, shh! Not another word.

01:25:37.256 --> 01:25:39.591
I just wanted to be sure
that you weren't alone.

01:25:39.675 --> 01:25:43.428
[laughs] Well, have a wonderful time,
and-and Merry Christmas.

01:25:43.512 --> 01:25:45.680
- The same to you, sir.
- Yeah.

01:25:48.809 --> 01:25:51.186
[indistinct chatter]

01:25:58.319 --> 01:25:59.695
Eh..

01:25:59.779 --> 01:26:02.156
Well, Pirovitch, I, uh..

01:26:02.239 --> 01:26:03.615
I presume you're going to have

01:26:03.699 --> 01:26:05.659
a nice little party
at your house tonight.

01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:08.454
Yes, I should say.

01:26:08.537 --> 01:26:11.748
You probably have some guests?

01:26:11.832 --> 01:26:13.625
No, no, no, Mr. Matuschek.

01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:16.336
Just my wife, my boy,
and my little baby and myself.

01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.922
That's all we want,
and we are very happy.

01:26:19.006 --> 01:26:21.758
Yeah. Well, Merry Christmas.

01:26:21.842 --> 01:26:23.510
Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek.

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:33.979
Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek.

01:26:34.063 --> 01:26:35.647
Oh, thank you, Flora and please

01:26:35.731 --> 01:26:37.232
give my regards to your mother.

01:26:37.316 --> 01:26:39.151
Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.

01:26:42.446 --> 01:26:44.448
Still hanging around the shop,
eh, Mr. Matuschek?

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:46.617
- Yeah.
- Can't get away from here, huh?

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:48.536
Well, you'd better
hurry home, son.

01:26:48.619 --> 01:26:51.163
You, uh, you're probably
celebrating Christmas

01:26:51.247 --> 01:26:52.957
with your mother and father.
Am I wrong?

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.168
Yes, Mr. Matuschek. See that
girl over there on the corner?

01:26:56.252 --> 01:26:58.462
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm her Santa Claus.

01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:01.382
- Goodnight, Mr. Matuschek.
- Uh, goodnight.

01:27:05.428 --> 01:27:08.055
Mr. Matuschek, I don't know
how to thank you

01:27:08.139 --> 01:27:09.640
for that marvelous present.

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:11.809
After all, I'm only working here
a short time.

01:27:11.892 --> 01:27:15.270
Oh, that's alright.
What was your name?

01:27:15.354 --> 01:27:17.105
- Rudy.
- Rudy.

01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:19.024
- How old are you, Rudy?
- Seventeen.

01:27:19.108 --> 01:27:21.193
Seventeen.
That's a wonderful age.

01:27:21.277 --> 01:27:22.987
You've got your whole life
ahead of you.

01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:24.571
But it's up to you
what you make of it.

01:27:24.655 --> 01:27:25.906
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:27.950
Well, uh, you better not
squander that money.

01:27:28.033 --> 01:27:29.909
You take it home and give it
to your mother, huh?

01:27:29.994 --> 01:27:32.079
My people don't live here
in town, Mr. Matuschek.

01:27:32.163 --> 01:27:33.664
Is that so?

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:34.915
Have you no other relations
here?

01:27:34.999 --> 01:27:36.625
No, Mr. Matuschek.

01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:40.462
You mean you're all alone
in Budapest on Christmas Eve?

01:27:40.546 --> 01:27:42.673
That's right.

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:46.677
Rudy!
Do you like chicken noodle soup?

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.304
I certainly do, Mr. Matuschek.

01:27:48.387 --> 01:27:51.681
Yeah, and, uh, and what would
you think of roast goose

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:53.559
stuffed with baked apples?

01:27:53.642 --> 01:27:55.644
And fresh boiled potatoes
and butter

01:27:55.728 --> 01:27:57.896
and some red cabbage
on the side, huh?

01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:59.189
- I'd love it!
- Yeah?

01:27:59.273 --> 01:28:02.234
And then cucumber salad
with sour cream?

01:28:02.318 --> 01:28:03.902
Oh, Mr. Matuschek!

01:28:03.986 --> 01:28:07.990
And then a double order of apple
strudel with vanilla sauce.

01:28:08.073 --> 01:28:09.657
- Sounds wonderful!
- Yes!

01:28:09.742 --> 01:28:13.370
Well, you're going to have it,
Rudy. Come on. Here, taxi!

01:28:15.873 --> 01:28:17.624
Oh, it's lovely,
I'm sure he'll like it.

01:28:17.708 --> 01:28:18.750
I think so, too.

01:28:18.834 --> 01:28:20.460
Well, Merry Christmas, Kiara.

01:28:20.544 --> 01:28:22.504
And I hope everything turns out
just the way you want it to.

01:28:22.588 --> 01:28:24.298
Thank you, Ilona,
Merry Christmas to you too.

01:28:24.381 --> 01:28:25.715
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:28:33.724 --> 01:28:35.142
Oh, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

01:28:35.226 --> 01:28:36.227
I'll be out in just a second.

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:37.728
Oh, that's alright, no hurry.

01:28:39.146 --> 01:28:41.898
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, uh..

01:28:41.982 --> 01:28:45.860
I decided to follow
your advice after all.

01:28:45.945 --> 01:28:48.030
- Wanna see something?
- Uh-huh.

01:28:57.998 --> 01:28:59.749
Oh!

01:29:01.085 --> 01:29:02.586
Oh!

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.881
Oh! That's beautiful.

01:29:05.965 --> 01:29:07.967
Look, why don't you try it on?

01:29:08.050 --> 01:29:10.135
Yeah, come on, I'd like to see
what it looks like on a girl.

01:29:10.219 --> 01:29:11.345
[chuckles]

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.187
- Are those real diamonds?
- They're pretty near.

01:29:20.271 --> 01:29:21.397
Oh, my!

01:29:22.982 --> 01:29:24.858
My!

01:29:24.942 --> 01:29:27.152
I didn't know
you had a girlfriend.

01:29:27.236 --> 01:29:30.822
Oh, yes, it probably isn't easy
for you to imagine anyone

01:29:30.906 --> 01:29:32.532
like a man of my type--

01:29:32.616 --> 01:29:35.910
Oh, Mr. Kralik, don't let's
start all over again.

01:29:35.995 --> 01:29:38.789
It's Christmas, and I'd like
to be friends with you.

01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:41.166
Beside, you're wrong.

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.877
Do you mind if I tell you
something?

01:29:43.961 --> 01:29:45.212
No, not at all.

01:29:45.296 --> 01:29:47.798
Well, when I first
came to work here

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:50.301
something very strange
happened to me.

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:52.636
I got psychologically mixed up.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.179
- You don't say?
- Yes.

01:29:54.263 --> 01:29:56.515
I found myself looking at you
again and again.

01:29:56.599 --> 01:29:58.601
I just couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

01:29:58.684 --> 01:30:00.185
-Oh.
-Mm- hm.

01:30:00.269 --> 01:30:02.062
And all the time
I kept saying, to myself

01:30:02.146 --> 01:30:04.648
"Kiara Novak, what on earth
is the matter with you?

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:05.941
"This Kralik
is not a particularly

01:30:06.025 --> 01:30:07.359
attractive type of man."

01:30:07.443 --> 01:30:09.194
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, not at all.

01:30:09.278 --> 01:30:13.156
Now, here comes the paradox.
I found myself falling for you.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.491
- I can't believe it.
- Yes, Mr. Kralik.

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:16.201
And very much so.

01:30:16.285 --> 01:30:17.911
- You certainly didn't show it.
- Listen..

01:30:17.995 --> 01:30:19.955
In those first few weeks..

01:30:20.039 --> 01:30:22.666
I-I know you won't misconstrue
what I'm going to say to you.

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.877
After all, I'm very happily
engaged.

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:26.127
At least it looks that way.

01:30:26.211 --> 01:30:27.754
Yes. Well, go on.

01:30:27.838 --> 01:30:30.924
Oh, I-in those first few weeks,
there were moments

01:30:31.008 --> 01:30:32.718
in the stockroom

01:30:32.801 --> 01:30:35.261
when you could have swept me
off of my feet.

01:30:38.265 --> 01:30:40.642
Now I'm getting
psychologically mixed up.

01:30:40.726 --> 01:30:43.061
Well, you see, I was
a different girl, then.

01:30:43.145 --> 01:30:45.480
I was really rather naive.

01:30:45.564 --> 01:30:46.940
All my knowledge came from books

01:30:47.024 --> 01:30:48.066
and I'd just finished a novel

01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:50.152
about a glamorous French actress

01:30:50.235 --> 01:30:52.946
from the <i>Comedie Francaise.</i>

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:55.198
That's a theater in France.

01:30:55.282 --> 01:30:57.033
And when she wanted
to arouse a man's interest

01:30:57.117 --> 01:30:58.618
she treated him like a dog.

01:30:58.702 --> 01:31:00.620
Yes, well, you treated me
like a dog.

01:31:00.704 --> 01:31:04.833
Yes, but instead of
licking my hand, you barked.

01:31:04.917 --> 01:31:07.502
You see, my mistake was
I didn't realize that

01:31:07.586 --> 01:31:09.087
the difference between
this glamorous lady

01:31:09.171 --> 01:31:12.048
and me was that she was with
the <i>Comedie Francaise</i>

01:31:12.132 --> 01:31:15.135
and I was with
Matuschek and Company.

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:17.804
Oh, well, that's all
forgotten now.

01:31:17.888 --> 01:31:20.390
So now you're going
to see your girlfriend.

01:31:20.474 --> 01:31:21.892
By the way, is it serious?

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:23.602
Yes, very.

01:31:23.686 --> 01:31:28.186
Maybe, maybe we'll both be
engaged Monday morning.

01:31:28.732 --> 01:31:29.983
I think we will.

01:31:30.067 --> 01:31:31.193
Well, I don't misunderstand me

01:31:31.276 --> 01:31:32.485
I just said in my case

01:31:32.569 --> 01:31:34.112
it might happen.

01:31:34.196 --> 01:31:37.324
Well, as a matter of fact,
I can tell you, it will happen.

01:31:40.202 --> 01:31:41.786
How do you know?

01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:44.038
Well, we won't go into that.

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:53.841
Mr. Kralik, wh-what do
you mean you know?

01:31:53.924 --> 01:31:55.634
Uh, well, I guess
I might as well tell you.

01:31:55.718 --> 01:31:57.261
- He came to see me.
- Who?

01:31:57.344 --> 01:31:59.095
Your fiance.

01:31:59.179 --> 01:32:00.638
- Yes, yes, he came last night.
- But..

01:32:00.723 --> 01:32:02.224
You shouldn't have told him
who I am.

01:32:02.307 --> 01:32:04.100
I spent a very
uncomfortable hour.

01:32:04.184 --> 01:32:05.518
Apparently, he didn't
believe it when you wrote

01:32:05.602 --> 01:32:07.228
that I meant nothing to you.

01:32:07.312 --> 01:32:11.316
[sighs] I can't get it into my
head. Coming to see you?

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.527
Oh, no, that doesn't
sound like him at all.

01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:15.612
Well, now, listen, I've
straightened everything out.

01:32:15.696 --> 01:32:16.988
Yeah, you don't have to worry.

01:32:17.072 --> 01:32:20.200
You.. In a little while
you'll be Mrs. Popkin.

01:32:20.284 --> 01:32:22.995
M-Mrs. Popkin?

01:32:23.078 --> 01:32:24.746
That's the name, isn't it?
Popkin.

01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:26.331
That's the name he gave me.

01:32:26.415 --> 01:32:30.335
Pop.. Oh, yes, that's right.
Popkin. Popkin.

01:32:30.419 --> 01:32:33.422
And a very nice fellow.
A very nice fellow.

01:32:33.505 --> 01:32:34.923
I congratulate you.

01:32:35.007 --> 01:32:36.133
Thank you.

01:32:38.343 --> 01:32:42.843
I think he's a very
attractive man, don't you?

01:32:43.265 --> 01:32:44.933
Oh, yes. Yes.

01:32:45.017 --> 01:32:48.520
For his type, I'd say yes.

01:32:48.604 --> 01:32:52.441
You would, uh, really classify
him as a definite type?

01:32:52.524 --> 01:32:56.819
Oh, absolutely! And, uh, don't
you try and change him now.

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:59.615
Now don't put him on a diet.

01:32:59.698 --> 01:33:03.243
- Would you call him fat?
- Well, I wouldn't.

01:33:03.327 --> 01:33:04.745
But, of course, that's just
a matter of opinion.

01:33:04.828 --> 01:33:06.621
Now personally, I think
that little stomach of his

01:33:06.705 --> 01:33:08.373
gives him a nice, homey quality.

01:33:08.457 --> 01:33:10.625
And that's what you want
in a husband, isn't it?

01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:13.461
- Oh, yes, that's what I want.
- Yeah.

01:33:13.545 --> 01:33:14.879
And you're perfectly right.

01:33:14.963 --> 01:33:16.631
Now if I were a girl
and had to choose

01:33:16.715 --> 01:33:18.174
between a young,
good-for-nothing

01:33:18.258 --> 01:33:21.135
with plenty of hair,
and a good solid, mature citizen

01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:23.555
I'd pick Mathias Popkin
every time.

01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:29.561
Well, anyway,
he has a fine mind.

01:33:29.645 --> 01:33:32.814
Uh, didn't he impress you
as being rather witty?

01:33:32.898 --> 01:33:34.608
Well, he struck me
as rather depressed

01:33:34.691 --> 01:33:36.025
but of course, it's unfair
to judge a man

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:37.277
when he's out of a job.

01:33:37.361 --> 01:33:39.946
Out of a job!
He never told me!

01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:41.656
Why, that shows you
how sensitive he is.

01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:43.700
[stammers]
You have nothing to worry about.

01:33:43.784 --> 01:33:45.327
No, he feels
that both of you can live

01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:47.453
very nicely on your salary.

01:33:49.623 --> 01:33:53.293
Did you tell him
h-how much I make?

01:33:53.377 --> 01:33:55.921
Well, he's your fiance,
and he asked me.

01:33:56.004 --> 01:33:58.464
I, when I told him
what salary you made

01:33:58.549 --> 01:34:00.342
he was a little worried

01:34:00.425 --> 01:34:02.385
but then I promised him that you
were gonna get a raise

01:34:02.469 --> 01:34:04.220
and he felt much better
about it.

01:34:04.304 --> 01:34:06.097
And let me tell you,
mentioning that bonus

01:34:06.181 --> 01:34:08.474
didn't do you any harm at all.

01:34:08.559 --> 01:34:10.894
Oh, this is terrible.

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:12.229
Why, I'm outraged!

01:34:12.312 --> 01:34:16.107
I had no idea he was
materialistic like this.

01:34:16.191 --> 01:34:17.400
Why, if you could read
his letters.

01:34:17.484 --> 01:34:21.984
Such ideals,
such a lofty point of view.

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:25.868
- I could quote you passages.
- For instance?

01:34:25.951 --> 01:34:30.451
Well, "True love is to be two,
and yet one. A man--"

01:34:32.082 --> 01:34:36.294
"A man and a woman
blended as angels.

01:34:36.378 --> 01:34:39.506
Heaven itself." That's Victor
Hugo. He stole that.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:42.467
Oh.

01:34:45.762 --> 01:34:48.389
And I thought
I was the inspiration

01:34:48.473 --> 01:34:51.767
for all those beautiful
thoughts.

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:56.352
Now I find he was just copying
words out of a book.

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:59.067
He probably didn't mean
a single one of them.

01:35:00.611 --> 01:35:01.695
Well, uh..

01:35:03.697 --> 01:35:05.657
I'm sorry you feel this way
about it.

01:35:05.741 --> 01:35:09.661
I'd hate to think I'm spoiling
your Christmas.

01:35:09.745 --> 01:35:14.124
I'd built up
such an illusion about him.

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:16.627
I thought he was so perfect.

01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:20.046
I had to come along
and destroy it, huh?

01:35:20.130 --> 01:35:21.631
That's alright.

01:35:21.715 --> 01:35:25.510
I-I guess I really ought
to thank you.

01:35:28.013 --> 01:35:30.473
Kiara, if I'd only known
in the beginning

01:35:30.557 --> 01:35:31.849
how you really felt about me

01:35:31.934 --> 01:35:34.102
things would have been
different. I..

01:35:34.186 --> 01:35:37.397
We wouldn't have been fighting
all the time.

01:35:37.481 --> 01:35:39.024
If we did quarrel,
it wouldn't have been

01:35:39.107 --> 01:35:41.317
over suitcases and handbags

01:35:41.401 --> 01:35:43.820
but over something like whether

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:45.155
your aunt or grandmother

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:47.241
should live with us or not.

01:35:50.953 --> 01:35:55.453
It's sweet of you to try to
cheer me up.

01:35:55.999 --> 01:35:58.626
I guess we'd better say
goodnight.

01:36:00.587 --> 01:36:04.424
You have an engagement,
yes, and so have I

01:36:04.508 --> 01:36:05.926
and we shouldn't be late.

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:09.554
Do you know what I wish
would happen?

01:36:09.638 --> 01:36:12.182
When your bell rings at 8:30,
and you open the door

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:15.394
and instead of Popkin,
I come in.

01:36:15.477 --> 01:36:17.479
No, please, don't make it more
difficult for me.

01:36:17.562 --> 01:36:20.439
- And I'd say, "Kiara, darling."
- Oh, no, you mustn't.

01:36:20.524 --> 01:36:23.527
Oh, dearest, sweetheart Kiara,
I can't stand it any longer.

01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:26.696
Please take your key
and open post office box 237

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.656
and take me out of my envelope
and kiss me.

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.242
Mr. Kralik, you must..

01:36:47.801 --> 01:36:49.135
Dear friend.

01:36:51.930 --> 01:36:53.014
You?

01:36:54.474 --> 01:36:55.766
Dear friend?

01:37:00.105 --> 01:37:01.815
Are you disappointed?

01:37:08.405 --> 01:37:11.908
Psychologically,
I'm very confused..

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:18.874
...but personally,
I don't feel bad at all.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.167
Oh, Kiara.

01:37:24.588 --> 01:37:28.675
Tell me, when you came
to the cafe that night..

01:37:28.759 --> 01:37:30.969
Oh, I was pretty rude, wasn't I?

01:37:31.053 --> 01:37:33.180
- Oh, no. No.
- Yes, I was.

01:37:33.263 --> 01:37:35.056
Don't you remember? I..

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:37.308
Why, I called you bowlegged.

01:37:37.392 --> 01:37:39.185
Oh, well, yeah, I know.

01:37:39.269 --> 01:37:41.104
And I was going to prove to you
that I wasn't.

01:37:41.188 --> 01:37:43.064
I was going to go out to the
street and pull up my trousers.

01:37:43.148 --> 01:37:44.983
[chuckles]
Yes. Well..

01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:48.612
Would you mind very much if I
asked you to pull them up now?

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.797
[instrumental music]
