16:35.579 --> 16:39.249
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

16:40.209 --> 16:42.294
How dare you show your face to me.

16:42.461 --> 16:47.841
[sighs] I know you're angry.
You have every right.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.093
But it is good to see you, Puss.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.221
[Puss growls]
- Are those new boots?

16:52.387 --> 16:56.892
No! They are the same boots
I wore when you betrayed me.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.645
[stammers] Betrayed you?

16:59.811 --> 17:01.897
You left me cracked
in pieces on a bridge,

17:02.064 --> 17:03.232
surrounded by soldiers!

17:03.398 --> 17:04.733
They wrote a song about it!

17:04.900 --> 17:08.069
And how did we get
on that bridge in the first place?!

17:08.237 --> 17:11.114
Because we were brothers, and brothers
are supposed to look after each other...

17:11.281 --> 17:12.449
Humpty!

17:14.701 --> 17:16.703
Remember why we're here.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.205
I should have known.

17:20.249 --> 17:22.459
I had the magic beans in my grasp,

17:22.626 --> 17:27.464
and you sent this very attractive
devil woman to interfere.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.216
You are a curse on my life!

17:29.383 --> 17:31.051
Whoa, whoa, wait. Hear me out. OK?

17:31.218 --> 17:33.762
Yes, yes, I sent Kitty
to bring you here.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.098
But she is no ordinary thief.

17:37.808 --> 17:39.560
She's Kitty Soft paws.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.895
The softest touch in Spain.

17:42.062 --> 17:45.023
That's a lot of heel for a guy,
don't you think?

17:48.068 --> 17:49.486
[sighs]

17:49.653 --> 17:51.989
Look, with Kitty's skill,
your sword and my brain,

17:52.155 --> 17:53.740
we've got a fighting chance here.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.743
Puss, come on, you of all people
know that nobody's ever ripped off

17:56.910 --> 17:59.538
the giant's castle
and lived to tell the tale.

17:59.705 --> 18:02.040
You want to survive? You need a plan.

18:03.125 --> 18:07.504
And I've studied this job
my whole life. You know that.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.798
Let's be honest.

18:09.965 --> 18:12.342
Without me, you don't even know
where to plant the beans, Puss.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.887
But Jack and Jill do.
They're on their way.

18:17.306 --> 18:22.311
We go up the beanstalk outlaws,
and we come down legends.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.023
So what do you say?

18:26.982 --> 18:28.317
Partners?

18:31.320 --> 18:33.989
No. Never again.

18:35.824 --> 18:39.494
I'm sorry, OK? How long
are you gonna hold a grudge?

18:39.661 --> 18:43.999
It's been seven years!
That's like 35 cat years.

18:44.166 --> 18:47.502
You need me! And I need you.

18:49.379 --> 18:53.634
Puss! You got any idea what they
do to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

18:55.302 --> 18:56.720
[ballad stops]

18:57.679 --> 19:00.015
I'll tell you this, my friend.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.559
It ain't over easy.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.145
Ohhh!

19:07.022 --> 19:10.692
Adi√≥s... Humpty Dumpty.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.823
[ballad resumes]

19:16.990 --> 19:18.867
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.078
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.372
I know how to speak meow.

19:23.705 --> 19:26.249
Sad story with your twisted lies

19:26.416 --> 19:29.336
in your greasy shell
that smells like old ham!

19:29.503 --> 19:32.214
I should crack you open for... [gasps]

19:33.048 --> 19:35.050
[growls playfully]

19:35.217 --> 19:37.177
[grunting]

19:42.015 --> 19:44.518
[Kitty chuckling] Look what I found.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.563
[sing-songy]
Someone forgot his money.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.148
[coins rattle]

19:51.608 --> 19:54.444
Oh, you are dangerous.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.656
[chuckles] Humpty says you like danger.

20:00.909 --> 20:04.496
Just think of all the trouble
we can get into.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.751
The two of us together.

20:09.918 --> 20:13.922
We can steal a lot of golden eggs.

20:15.132 --> 20:16.133
Hmm?

20:17.634 --> 20:18.635
[groans]

20:20.095 --> 20:22.472
And... you owe me.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.559
- I owe you?
- Mm-hm.

20:25.726 --> 20:28.145
You hit me in the head with a guitar.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.522
I regret the guitar.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.816
OK, I forgive you.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.193
So... you're in?

20:35.360 --> 20:36.987
[chuckling]

20:37.154 --> 20:41.742
There is one teeny, tiny,
itty-bitty problem.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.660
And what is that?

20:43.827 --> 20:46.955
You work for the egg!

20:47.122 --> 20:48.665
Oh, come on, Puss.

20:48.832 --> 20:52.169
What happened between you
and Humpty that was so bad?

20:54.463 --> 20:57.174
I am afraid with me and Humpty...

20:57.340 --> 21:00.260
[sighs] ...the scars are too deep.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.806
[sighs]

21:04.973 --> 21:07.934
It all started a long time ago.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.811
Oh, no. You really don't have to tell me

21:09.978 --> 21:12.898
- your whole life story, please.
- You may want to sit.

21:14.316 --> 21:18.153
It is at times quite... painful.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.905
OK, here we go.

21:21.281 --> 21:25.494
It was a year in which
the rain had not fallen.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.289
<i>The wind was big
and the basket was small.</i>

21:29.998 --> 21:31.958
<i>For days, I bounced along...</i>

21:32.125 --> 21:37.506
<i>a hungry little kitten with no milk,
no mama, and no litter box.</i>

21:37.672 --> 21:42.177
<i>Until I came to rest at a home
for lost children.</i>

21:44.429 --> 21:45.597
[mews]

21:45.764 --> 21:48.308
Ohh. [chuckles]

21:48.475 --> 21:49.935
[clicks tongue]

21:50.101 --> 21:54.022
<i>[Puss] Her name was Imelda.
And, like a mother,</i>

21:54.189 --> 21:57.692
<i>she took me into her heart
and raised me as her own.</i>

21:57.859 --> 21:59.986
[kids shouting]

22:00.153 --> 22:01.446
[Imelda] Silencio.

22:02.447 --> 22:03.740
<i>Silencio.</i>

22:03.907 --> 22:06.117
<i>[Puss] She was an angel of kindness.</i>

22:06.284 --> 22:08.161
<i>Silencio!</i>

22:08.328 --> 22:10.455
<i>[shouting stops]
[Puss] Most of the time.</i>

22:10.622 --> 22:14.209
I'd like to introduce
a new boy joining us.

22:14.376 --> 22:18.046
It's OK, peque√±o.
You show with the face.

22:21.967 --> 22:23.301
Go on.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.264
[mews]

22:28.932 --> 22:32.310
<i>[Puss] And that was
the moment I met...</i>

22:32.477 --> 22:34.312
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.481
[boy] Hey, Whiskers!

22:36.648 --> 22:38.733
You're sitting
in Little Boy Blue's chair.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.403
[squeaks]
- Oh, come on. Is this necessary?

22:41.570 --> 22:43.655
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

22:43.822 --> 22:45.615
Who asked you, Breakfast?

22:45.782 --> 22:47.242
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue:

22:47.409 --> 22:50.537
If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

22:50.704 --> 22:52.497
- Let's spin him.
[shrieks]

22:52.664 --> 22:54.332
Please don't spin me. Do not spin me!

22:54.499 --> 22:56.960
Not again! No! I'm gonna yolk!

22:57.127 --> 23:00.672
<i>[Puss] Even though he took
my beans, the egg stood up for me,</i>

23:00.839 --> 23:02.966
<i>- and I decided then...
[grunts]</i>

23:03.133 --> 23:05.343
<i>that I would always
have his back.</i>

23:06.052 --> 23:07.220
[grunts]

23:09.055 --> 23:10.056
[hisses]

23:12.601 --> 23:13.852
Wow!

23:14.019 --> 23:16.187
That was very impressive. Thanks!

23:16.354 --> 23:18.481
[horn blowing]
[girl] Hey, egg boy!

23:18.648 --> 23:20.734
[girl clucks]

23:20.901 --> 23:23.737
<i>[Puss] There was something
about this strange little egg</i>

23:23.904 --> 23:25.864
<i>that intrigued me.</i>

23:41.546 --> 23:44.925
[shrieks] Oh... it's you.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.384
I've been collecting for months now.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.887
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky. You know what I mean?

23:50.555 --> 23:53.308
[whispering]
Magic beans... is what they are.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.395
Hello? You gonna tell all the other kids

23:57.562 --> 24:00.148
that I believe in magic now?
Is that what you're gonna do?

24:02.442 --> 24:04.361
No? What's your name?

24:04.861 --> 24:07.822
[mews]
- You don't say much, do you?

24:07.989 --> 24:10.367
I think I'll call you Sparky.

24:11.326 --> 24:12.661
Whiskers?

24:12.827 --> 24:14.037
Zoltar!

24:15.997 --> 24:18.750
How about Puss?

24:18.917 --> 24:22.629
<i>[Puss] Humpty's mind was full
of imagination and invention.</i>

24:22.796 --> 24:24.422
[Humpty] What is that,
50 feet down there?

24:24.589 --> 24:29.052
Here we go. Give me a... [yelling] Puss!

24:29.219 --> 24:33.348
[gasps]
- Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

24:33.515 --> 24:36.059
[laughs, grunts]

24:36.226 --> 24:40.355
<i>[Puss] He spoke of legends and
adventures beyond my wildest dreams.</i>

24:40.522 --> 24:43.608
Oh, when I find those
magic beans, they'll grow a vine

24:43.775 --> 24:45.944
straight up into the clouds,

24:46.111 --> 24:50.407
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure...

24:51.199 --> 24:53.201
the Golden Goose.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.578
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

24:55.745 --> 25:00.709
Just one of her golden eggs...
could set me for life.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.294
It's my destiny, Puss.

25:03.461 --> 25:08.925
I can't really explain it,
but I just feel like I belong up there.

25:09.092 --> 25:12.137
[sighs]

25:13.263 --> 25:15.598
Oh, boy. This is awkward.

25:15.765 --> 25:19.436
This is kind of a solo dream here.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.689
I don't need any dead weight,
you know, holding me down.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.482
[purring]

25:24.649 --> 25:27.777
What are you doing?
Oh, man, that's good.

25:27.944 --> 25:31.573
The eye thing that you're doing,
that is really splendid.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.743
OK, let me just think for a second.
All right... OK.

25:34.909 --> 25:38.204
Uh... This is crazy, but...

25:38.371 --> 25:41.541
I am considering a partnership.

25:43.168 --> 25:45.045
I just need to know one thing.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.380
Can you commit?

25:47.964 --> 25:49.799
<i>Si...</i> I can commit.

25:49.966 --> 25:53.261
Oh, you can talk!
Could you help me up?

25:53.428 --> 25:55.638
[grunting]

25:55.805 --> 25:56.973
OK...

25:58.850 --> 26:00.268
[Humpty] First rule of Bean Club...

26:01.644 --> 26:04.731
you do not talk about Bean Club.

26:04.898 --> 26:06.733
Second rule of Bean Club...

26:06.900 --> 26:10.945
is you don't talk
about Bean Club. You ready?

26:11.112 --> 26:12.238
Ready.

26:13.031 --> 26:15.408
From this day forth,
it shall be known...

26:16.076 --> 26:18.953
Never alone, always together...

26:19.120 --> 26:20.580
Humpty and Puss...

26:20.747 --> 26:22.248
[both] Brothers forever.

26:23.166 --> 26:26.753
<i>[Puss] And from that moment on,
we were united on a great adventure</i>

26:26.920 --> 26:29.005
<i>to find the magic beans.</i>

26:29.172 --> 26:30.215
Help me up.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.008
Egg me.

26:32.175 --> 26:33.802
<i>[Puss] Humpty was the brains...</i>

26:33.968 --> 26:36.846
[screams] Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

26:37.013 --> 26:39.724
<i>[Humpty] That really hurt!
[Puss] ...and I was the skill.</i>

26:40.767 --> 26:42.060
[Humpty] I'm cracked!

26:43.895 --> 26:45.730
We got red beans, green beans,

26:45.897 --> 26:49.067
coffee beans, lima beans...
but no magic beans.

26:50.485 --> 26:53.905
- Would you care for a jelly bean?
- Oh, thank you.

26:54.072 --> 26:56.533
<i>[Puss] Finding them
meant everything to us.</i>

26:57.158 --> 27:00.078
[Humpty] Oh, I almost forgot
the most important thing.

27:00.245 --> 27:01.913
That's me and you, Puss.

27:03.414 --> 27:04.916
Me and you.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.585
<i>[Puss] But we never did find them.</i>

27:07.752 --> 27:11.005
<i>And, as years passed,
the quest for magic beans</i>

27:11.172 --> 27:15.468
<i>seemed more and more
like the dreams of a child.</i>

27:15.635 --> 27:16.678
Aw!

27:16.845 --> 27:20.849
<i>[Puss] As teenagers,
Humpty and I looked for trouble...</i>

27:21.015 --> 27:22.851
<i>and often found it.</i>

27:23.017 --> 27:27.188
Third time this month, Imelda.
Next time is jail time.

27:27.355 --> 27:29.566
They're just kids. [chuckles]

27:29.732 --> 27:32.235
They are thieves.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.445
[Imelda clears throat]

27:36.281 --> 27:39.200
You are better than this.

27:39.367 --> 27:42.537
I believe in you with all my heart.

27:42.704 --> 27:46.332
Please do not let me down.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.084
I hate this place.

27:48.251 --> 27:50.795
I cannot wait for us to get out of here.

27:52.380 --> 27:54.591
Throw a rock.
It'll make you feel better.

27:56.009 --> 27:57.302
[bellows] [crowd gasps]

27:57.468 --> 27:58.636
Oh, boy. We should go.

28:01.139 --> 28:03.183
<i>[Puss] On instinct, I reacted.</i>

28:03.349 --> 28:04.350
Ha!

28:05.101 --> 28:06.144
[grunts]

28:06.311 --> 28:07.979
[bull snorts]
- Aah!

28:09.856 --> 28:12.358
[bellows in slow motion]

28:17.030 --> 28:21.201
He saved the Comandante's mother!

28:21.367 --> 28:23.786
[moos]

28:26.915 --> 28:29.667
You saved my mother.

28:29.834 --> 28:32.670
Se√±ior Puss... he is a hero!

28:32.837 --> 28:34.672
[cheering]

28:34.839 --> 28:39.177
Today we see that courage and bravery

28:39.344 --> 28:41.221
come in all sizes!

28:41.387 --> 28:45.808
<i>[Puss] Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.</i>

28:45.975 --> 28:48.603
These are for you, my boy.

28:48.770 --> 28:53.608
Wear them as a symbol
of honor... and justice.

28:53.775 --> 28:57.528
I will make you proud, Mama.

28:57.695 --> 29:02.700
You already have, my Puss In Boots.

29:05.036 --> 29:08.289
<i>[Puss] How strange it was
to give a cat boots...</i>

29:08.456 --> 29:11.626
<i>but, whoa... I looked good!</i>

29:11.793 --> 29:15.296
<i>And as the light of my path
grew brighter...</i>

29:15.463 --> 29:19.133
<i>Humpty's road grew ever darker.</i>

29:20.510 --> 29:22.262
[footsteps approach]

29:25.556 --> 29:27.308
Gracias, Comandante.

29:27.475 --> 29:29.852
Be careful of the company you keep.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.771
[Spits]

29:31.938 --> 29:35.066
I know! I know, I never should've
tried something without you.

29:35.233 --> 29:37.360
You're not stealing
lollipops any more, Humpty.

29:37.527 --> 29:38.736
This is getting serious.

29:38.903 --> 29:41.281
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.658
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

29:43.825 --> 29:46.577
I've been casing the silversmith
and it's perfect.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.205
You and me, in and out, 50 seconds tops.

29:49.372 --> 29:52.000
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.794
These people have done nothing to us.

29:54.961 --> 29:58.423
Our home? OK, yeah, I get it now.

29:58.589 --> 30:02.010
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

30:02.176 --> 30:03.553
That is not true.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.805
We weren't born here. We're orphans!

30:05.972 --> 30:07.765
All we got is each other,
you understand?

30:07.932 --> 30:09.559
We are better than this.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.478
But we're partners.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.689
We are brothers.

30:15.690 --> 30:18.151
But I am not stealing any more.

30:20.695 --> 30:23.156
<i>[Puss] But Humpty
would not give up so easily.</i>

30:23.323 --> 30:25.283
[yowls]
[Humpty] I'm in trouble, Puss!

30:25.450 --> 30:27.660
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

30:27.827 --> 30:29.954
They're coming for me.
Just get me over this wall.

30:30.121 --> 30:33.916
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

30:42.675 --> 30:45.511
[distant whistle blowing]

30:45.678 --> 30:47.972
OK, I've got everything.
We did it. Come on, let's go!

30:48.139 --> 30:49.640
How could you do this to me?!

30:49.807 --> 30:52.268
I did you a favor!
We can finally get out of here!

30:52.435 --> 30:55.063
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

30:55.229 --> 30:56.731
[Puss yowls] [groans]

30:58.983 --> 31:01.652
[gasps] You disgrace those boots!

31:01.819 --> 31:03.696
Comandante, please, I can explain!

31:03.863 --> 31:04.947
Arrest them!

31:05.114 --> 31:07.617
- Hiyah!
[whinnies]

31:09.243 --> 31:11.371
[Humpty] Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

31:11.537 --> 31:14.415
- You tricked me!
- I had to! You left me no choice!

31:14.582 --> 31:16.501
[horse whinnies]

31:18.086 --> 31:19.462
[men shouting]

31:22.590 --> 31:24.759
[gasps]
- Mama...

31:24.926 --> 31:26.761
<i>Peque√±o.</i>

31:27.553 --> 31:28.596
Oh! Watch out!

31:32.767 --> 31:34.477
Oh! Oof!

31:45.029 --> 31:48.699
- Oh, no.
[Humpty] Puss. I can't get up.

31:48.866 --> 31:50.993
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

31:51.160 --> 31:52.578
Freeze!

31:53.329 --> 31:55.081
Puss, save me!

31:56.124 --> 31:57.208
Save yourself.

31:58.418 --> 31:59.585
[guard] We got you.

32:14.517 --> 32:18.187
<i>[Puss] I lost everything
I cared about that day.</i>

32:19.188 --> 32:21.023
<i>My brother.</i>

32:21.190 --> 32:22.692
<i>My honor.</i>

32:22.859 --> 32:24.360
<i>My home.</i>

32:25.862 --> 32:30.450
<i>All I thought about was
the disappointment in my mama's eyes.</i>

32:31.868 --> 32:34.370
And I have been running ever since.

32:38.541 --> 32:41.377
The egg betrayed me.

32:41.544 --> 32:46.424
- His lies cost me everything.
[snoring]

32:47.425 --> 32:49.719
- Hew [snorts] I'm awake!

32:49.886 --> 32:52.013
[Humpty] You think
I don't want to fix the past?

32:55.516 --> 32:57.018
I can't get down.

32:57.185 --> 32:58.728
[sighs]

33:00.021 --> 33:02.315
[grunts]

33:06.110 --> 33:10.031
Listen. A day... A day doesn't go by

33:10.198 --> 33:12.325
when I don't think about what I lost.

33:14.535 --> 33:17.038
I lost my best friend.

33:17.205 --> 33:20.208
My only friend. And I get it now.

33:20.374 --> 33:22.585
I got greedy and desperate
and I let you down.

33:22.752 --> 33:24.795
I let myself down.

33:24.962 --> 33:27.465
All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

33:27.632 --> 33:31.594
Give me that second chance
and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.

33:31.761 --> 33:34.680
[sighs] Please, Puss.

33:34.847 --> 33:37.725
Let me show you
what our friendship meant to me.

33:38.851 --> 33:41.145
[sighs]

33:42.480 --> 33:45.274
- I will do it.
- Oh, that's great.

33:45.441 --> 33:50.446
I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo... not for you.

33:50.613 --> 33:53.991
We are not partners
and we are not friends.

33:55.409 --> 34:00.623
OK. I promise this time,
I will not let you down.

34:01.415 --> 34:03.668
Yes! [laughs]

34:03.834 --> 34:06.295
I think we got our Bean Club back.

34:08.005 --> 34:09.549
[grunts]

34:15.596 --> 34:17.723
[squealing]

34:26.148 --> 34:27.650
Humpty's plan better work.

34:27.817 --> 34:30.652
Listen, you just need
to worry about your part.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.822
Don't screw it up.

34:32.989 --> 34:35.324
- What?
- Again with the mask?

34:35.491 --> 34:38.286
I don't need style advice
from Mr. Dusty Boots.

34:38.452 --> 34:39.453
Huh?!

34:46.543 --> 34:48.337
Come on, Puss. Now!

34:51.507 --> 34:52.507
[both grunting]

34:52.675 --> 34:55.219
Our biological clocks
are tickin', darlin'.

34:55.386 --> 34:56.721
You gotta look at the big picture.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.973
- What's your problem?
- Huh?

34:59.140 --> 35:03.019
Listen. I put a lot of work
into my body. I look good, and I am not

35:03.185 --> 35:04.604
- just gonna throw that away.
[gasps]

35:07.523 --> 35:09.650
[whispers] Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

35:09.817 --> 35:11.152
[Jill] We're gonna start small.
- Look.

35:11.319 --> 35:13.404
[Jill] Let's just pretend
you have a baby.

35:14.905 --> 35:17.700
Excellent. [chuckles]

35:20.536 --> 35:23.080
[Jill] I don't have time to be at home
with no diapers and baby socks.

35:23.247 --> 35:25.916
You don't have to, Jill.
I'll be the stay-at-home dad.

35:26.083 --> 35:28.544
We got ten hungry piggies,
there in the back.

35:28.711 --> 35:31.505
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.591
[Jack] Little Hamhock's my favorite.
- You've got to hurry up.

35:33.758 --> 35:35.343
- Shh!
[Jack] He's a cute little bugger.

35:35.509 --> 35:37.553
Why are you not using your claws?

35:37.720 --> 35:39.680
Would you please just shut up!
I'm on it!

35:39.847 --> 35:42.308
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet.

35:42.475 --> 35:44.977
- Your claws!
- I don't have any claws, all right?!

35:45.144 --> 35:47.146
[snorting]
[Jill] Was that Hamhock?

35:47.313 --> 35:48.564
[Kitty gasps] [snorting]

35:48.731 --> 35:50.358
Shh. Shh. Shh.

35:53.319 --> 35:56.364
There, there.
Sleepy, sleepy, big, fat piggy.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.407
[squeals happily]

35:58.574 --> 36:01.077
[Jill] Remember when we had to pretend
we had that monkey one time...?

36:01.243 --> 36:03.037
- You babysit.
[groans]

36:03.204 --> 36:05.790
- Soft paws.
[Jack] When did we have a monkey?

36:05.956 --> 36:07.583
[Jill continues indistinctly]
[sighs]

36:08.876 --> 36:10.753
- Well?
[Jill] ...what happened last time...

36:10.920 --> 36:13.923
- You sat on it, Jack.
- Hello, beans of legend.

36:14.924 --> 36:16.884
- Let's go.
[squealing loudly]

36:18.552 --> 36:20.137
[groans]

36:21.138 --> 36:23.391
[metallic clicking]

36:24.975 --> 36:28.521
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Jill.

36:28.688 --> 36:31.232
You messed with our baby.

36:31.399 --> 36:32.775
[growling]

36:32.942 --> 36:36.195
And you took my beans. [cackles]

36:37.154 --> 36:38.364
- Sausage bomb!
[squealing]

36:38.531 --> 36:40.491
[yowling] [Jack] Whoa!

36:44.578 --> 36:47.039
[Jill] You're gonna pay for this!
Soul-sucking cats!

36:47.206 --> 36:49.208
[muffled shouting]

36:49.375 --> 36:50.459
Signal the egg!

36:51.836 --> 36:54.004
- Yes!
[Whip cracks]

36:57.967 --> 36:59.593
- OK.
- Ready.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.303
- Set.
- Go!

37:02.388 --> 37:03.431
Ow!

37:04.390 --> 37:06.517
[Jill cackling]

37:07.309 --> 37:08.769
[groans]

37:13.691 --> 37:15.025
[squealing]

37:15.192 --> 37:16.944
[grunts]

37:17.111 --> 37:19.363
[Jill snarling]
- Oh, my God!

37:21.449 --> 37:24.034
[snarling] [gasps]

37:26.871 --> 37:27.955
Whoa!

37:30.791 --> 37:32.042
[groans]

37:32.209 --> 37:33.794
[grunting]

37:33.961 --> 37:35.129
[sighs] Ah!

37:35.296 --> 37:37.006
[Jill chuckles]

37:37.173 --> 37:40.009
All right, cat.
Give me them beans.

37:40.176 --> 37:41.510
[yells, whimpers]

37:41.677 --> 37:44.430
Is it true
a cat always lands on its feet?

37:44.597 --> 37:47.349
No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!

37:48.058 --> 37:49.643
Well, let's find out.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.020
Hiyah!

37:51.187 --> 37:52.980
[Jill shrieks]
- Hiyah!

37:57.318 --> 37:58.986
See? I told you I wouldn't let you down!

37:59.153 --> 38:02.198
[gun blast]
- You think this is over? Ha!

38:04.617 --> 38:05.451
[gasps]

38:06.577 --> 38:09.371
[whinnies]
- Hey, that was close!

38:09.538 --> 38:10.831
[cackles]

38:15.503 --> 38:16.545
Hiyah!

38:19.799 --> 38:20.883
Now!

38:21.967 --> 38:23.719
[Humpty screams]

38:23.886 --> 38:27.348
We just got to make it
to that bridge! Hang on!

38:28.766 --> 38:31.268
- Humpty! There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

38:31.936 --> 38:32.770
[squealing]

38:35.940 --> 38:37.650
[yelling] [squealing]

38:37.817 --> 38:39.568
[both] Humpty!

38:39.735 --> 38:42.446
[screaming]

38:42.613 --> 38:43.531
[both gasp]

38:43.697 --> 38:47.660
- We're going to die!
[whinnies]

38:50.663 --> 38:52.456
[shouts echoing]

38:58.838 --> 39:02.258
- I hate cats.
- This is war!

39:05.469 --> 39:08.347
[cheering, laughter echoing]

39:09.390 --> 39:10.808
[laughter]

39:10.975 --> 39:12.643
Giant's castle...

39:13.310 --> 39:14.812
here we come.

39:17.606 --> 39:19.817
[Puss sighs] I must hand it to the egg.

39:19.984 --> 39:22.778
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

39:22.945 --> 39:26.115
I mean, flaws.
That was what I meant, not claws.

39:26.282 --> 39:28.284
He's not a cat. [chuckles nervously]

39:28.450 --> 39:31.328
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

39:31.495 --> 39:32.872
Got it.

39:33.038 --> 39:35.916
[muttering] OK, we should be close!

39:37.126 --> 39:39.211
Keep your eyes out
for any strange cloud activity!

39:40.504 --> 39:43.090
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

39:43.257 --> 39:45.551
and you'll never even know I was there.

39:46.343 --> 39:47.720
[gasps]

39:48.929 --> 39:50.347
[groans]

39:51.807 --> 39:52.892
Kitty?

39:54.310 --> 39:56.186
You are not as good as they say.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.190
You're better.

40:03.319 --> 40:05.821
I will respect your privacy.

40:09.450 --> 40:12.953
[Kitty sighs] OK. I'll tell you.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.748
I was just a stray...

40:15.915 --> 40:18.584
but I had beautiful claws.

40:19.960 --> 40:23.631
One day,
a really nice couple took me in.

40:23.797 --> 40:26.133
Gave me milk every morning.

40:26.300 --> 40:27.635
Loved me.

40:29.470 --> 40:34.475
Maybe I scratched their curtains
or played too rough with the hamster.

40:34.642 --> 40:36.977
I don't know why they did it.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.688
But they took my claws.

40:41.357 --> 40:45.402
- Cat people are crazy.
[chuckles]

40:45.569 --> 40:47.321
Stop the coach! I think this is it!

40:53.327 --> 40:57.373
[shrieks] Ooh! Whoo!

40:57.539 --> 40:59.333
[muttering]

41:04.880 --> 41:07.049
[panting]

41:08.092 --> 41:09.635
Can you believe this, Puss?

41:09.802 --> 41:12.554
After all these years!

41:14.056 --> 41:17.226
Here. I want you to plant them.

41:23.107 --> 41:25.317
That... is a strange cloud.

41:25.484 --> 41:26.944
[gasps]

41:28.362 --> 41:31.824
[Humpty] Whoa! OK! This is it!
It's happening, hurry!

41:34.576 --> 41:36.036
This Way!

41:36.203 --> 41:38.288
Good, good.
Come on, come on, come on.

41:38.455 --> 41:40.708
Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.

41:40.874 --> 41:42.543
Hole! Right here.

41:45.546 --> 41:47.089
Now place the beans.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.093
[gasps]
Place the beans carefully, please.

41:51.260 --> 41:54.430
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

41:54.596 --> 41:58.559
OK, good. Very good
Now just stand back.

42:05.482 --> 42:08.277
[wind howling]

42:09.403 --> 42:10.612
[gasps]

42:15.617 --> 42:17.578
[Puss grunting]

42:21.457 --> 42:22.541
[grunts]

42:23.584 --> 42:25.711
[booming]

42:28.797 --> 42:31.383
[whooshing]

42:31.550 --> 42:33.177
Whoa! [shrieks]

42:41.977 --> 42:43.228
What's happening here?

42:43.395 --> 42:45.189
Maybe the magic rubbed off
in your pocket?

42:45.355 --> 42:48.567
- That's impossible.
- OK, OK. Let's not panic.

42:48.734 --> 42:50.778
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

42:50.944 --> 42:54.656
So, come on...
say something nice to it.

42:54.823 --> 42:55.908
OK.

42:56.950 --> 42:58.577
Let me just think for a second.

42:59.411 --> 43:00.412
Hi, little plant.

43:00.579 --> 43:01.580
[yelps]

43:03.499 --> 43:05.918
[stalk creaking]

43:08.170 --> 43:09.505
Whoa!

43:13.383 --> 43:15.969
[screaming]

43:16.136 --> 43:17.846
[grunts, gasps]

43:23.894 --> 43:25.229
[shouts, grunts]

43:27.439 --> 43:28.440
YOW!

43:28.607 --> 43:29.608
Oh!

43:30.526 --> 43:32.820
[grunts, chuckles]

43:35.656 --> 43:36.824
[grunts]

43:38.075 --> 43:40.661
[thunder booms] [groans]

44:19.032 --> 44:20.617
[gasps]

44:21.535 --> 44:23.704
[in high-pitched voice] Uh, guys? Whoa!

44:23.871 --> 44:25.706
[both in high-pitched voices] Humpty!

44:25.873 --> 44:28.876
- I do not see him. Do you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

44:29.042 --> 44:31.253
You sound weird.

44:31.420 --> 44:34.381
Ah! It's the thin air!

44:35.340 --> 44:39.178
Come on in! It feels great!

44:40.470 --> 44:42.681
[cheering]

44:45.642 --> 44:48.520
- The cloud, it tickles my nose.
[Humpty] Hoo-hoo!

44:48.687 --> 44:52.191
That's because they effervesce!
Who knew? Ho-ho!

44:52.357 --> 44:53.358
[chuckles]

44:54.776 --> 44:55.944
[chuckles]

44:56.486 --> 44:57.487
[chuckles]

44:58.238 --> 44:59.239
Come on.

44:59.406 --> 45:01.366
[playful shouting]

45:06.121 --> 45:07.623
[growls playfully]

45:14.379 --> 45:15.380
[gasps]

45:17.174 --> 45:18.342
Gotcha!

45:19.259 --> 45:20.385
[yowls playfully]

45:20.552 --> 45:22.304
[laughing]

45:22.471 --> 45:24.473
- Meow.
[chuckles]

45:24.640 --> 45:27.643
Hey, Puss.
What do you think? Do I shave?

45:27.809 --> 45:28.810
[chuckles]

45:28.977 --> 45:30.604
Let me show you something.

45:37.569 --> 45:40.030
Somewhere down there,
there are two little kids,

45:40.197 --> 45:42.324
I don't know, maybe orphans,

45:42.491 --> 45:45.410
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

45:45.577 --> 45:47.329
dreaming about the future.

45:48.330 --> 45:50.165
That was me and you, Puss.

45:50.832 --> 45:52.834
Me and you.

45:54.670 --> 45:55.963
[Kitty] Boys!

45:56.129 --> 45:59.091
You might want to take a look at this.

46:02.719 --> 46:05.305
[Humpty] The giant's castle.

46:06.098 --> 46:08.016
[gasps, chuckles]

46:08.225 --> 46:10.560
OK, time to suit up.

46:10.727 --> 46:11.770
Humpty!

46:11.937 --> 46:14.106
[Humpty] I'll fit right in
with the golden eggs.

46:14.273 --> 46:15.357
[groans]

46:18.110 --> 46:19.820
Brilliant or what, huh?

46:19.987 --> 46:23.532
Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

46:23.699 --> 46:26.201
What? Are you embarrassed?

46:26.368 --> 46:27.619
I'm not.

46:28.120 --> 46:32.374
[chuckles] Puss, remember when
everyone was laughing at Bean Club?

46:32.541 --> 46:35.544
[Puss] And who is laughing now?
Ha-ha! We are!

46:46.388 --> 46:48.223
Wow!

46:50.392 --> 46:51.393
[cloud thunks]

47:00.569 --> 47:03.572
[Humpty in normal voice]
That is our target.

47:03.739 --> 47:05.907
[in normal voice] Hey, you don't
sound like an elf any more.

47:06.074 --> 47:07.784
It's because the air pressure
in here is normal.

47:07.951 --> 47:08.952
Let's go.

47:12.998 --> 47:16.626
So here is the plan: You two get
the golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

47:16.793 --> 47:19.546
There's no giant to fight.
The giant's been dead for years.

47:19.713 --> 47:21.965
- What?!
- You didn't do the reading, did you?

47:22.132 --> 47:25.594
<i>Jack</i> and the Beanstalk, chapter 14,
"Giant Takes a Big Dirt Nap."

47:25.761 --> 47:28.513
- Ahh! Ankle burn.
[monstrous roar]

47:28.680 --> 47:30.349
[yelps] [Puss grunts]

47:30.515 --> 47:33.352
- Wha... What was that?
- They call it the Great Terror.

47:33.518 --> 47:35.937
It's the monster that guards
the Golden Goose.

47:36.104 --> 47:38.607
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

47:38.774 --> 47:42.319
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

47:42.486 --> 47:44.404
[whispers] Follow me and keep quiet.

47:44.571 --> 47:46.865
[Humpty's suit squeaking]

47:51.661 --> 47:54.331
[panting] [suit squeaking]

47:54.498 --> 47:55.749
Shh! Humpty!

47:55.916 --> 47:58.835
I can't help it.
Everything's rubbing and pinching!

47:59.002 --> 48:00.545
I need powder!

48:04.299 --> 48:05.467
[gasps]

48:08.345 --> 48:10.931
[distant shattering]
[monstrous roar]

48:11.098 --> 48:12.641
[Humpty shrieks]

48:12.808 --> 48:15.644
[thudding footsteps]

48:16.937 --> 48:18.313
How are we gonna get across?

48:18.480 --> 48:20.482
[clinking]
- Champagne.

48:24.027 --> 48:25.320
Cheers!

48:27.531 --> 48:30.659
[screaming]

48:32.828 --> 48:35.080
[roaring]

48:37.165 --> 48:38.917
Do not worry. I will protect you.

48:39.084 --> 48:41.753
[Tumbling] [gasps]

48:41.920 --> 48:43.088
What are you gonna do?

48:43.255 --> 48:45.090
Hit it in the head with a guitar?

48:45.257 --> 48:48.301
Please. Stop bringing up the guitar.

48:56.184 --> 48:58.562
[groans]

49:00.897 --> 49:02.941
[shrieking]

49:04.860 --> 49:06.653
[whimpering]

49:06.820 --> 49:09.197
Catch me! [yells]

49:10.365 --> 49:11.616
[roars]
- Hurry!

49:12.993 --> 49:14.369
Hide!

49:15.620 --> 49:16.872
[Humpty] Don't look at it!

49:17.038 --> 49:22.377
[bellowing breaths]
[Humpty gasping, muttering]

49:22.544 --> 49:25.130
- Shh! Humpty! Be quiet!
- I'm hyperventilating!

49:25.297 --> 49:28.884
[muffled] I said I couldn't breathe and
then you zipped the thing over my mouth!

49:29.050 --> 49:32.471
Shh! Hey. You gotta
get it together. Come on!

49:32.637 --> 49:33.889
OK.

49:38.268 --> 49:39.895
[Humpty grunts]

49:41.480 --> 49:42.898
[sighs]

49:45.484 --> 49:47.360
[gasps]

49:48.945 --> 49:52.532
[Humpty] Look at this.
It's egg paradise.

49:54.117 --> 49:56.786
It's so beautiful,
I feel like I belong here.

49:56.953 --> 49:58.538
[laughs maniacally]

50:00.165 --> 50:01.500
Whoo!

50:01.666 --> 50:02.959
[groans]

50:03.126 --> 50:05.504
Golden eggs. Oh!

50:06.755 --> 50:08.089
Grab as many as you can.

50:08.256 --> 50:13.053
[grunting] I thought they were
going to be like chicken size.

50:13.220 --> 50:17.432
Can you imagine laying
one of these? Ouch!

50:17.599 --> 50:21.102
- Puss! Ow!
[grunting]

50:21.978 --> 50:23.480
How are we supposed to get
these out of here?

50:23.647 --> 50:25.023
- I don't know.
- Shh!

50:25.190 --> 50:26.691
[quacking] [gasps]

50:27.442 --> 50:29.486
Oh, my!

50:32.280 --> 50:35.116
[Peeps]
[Puss] The Golden Goose.

50:36.785 --> 50:39.454
Just look at her. Isn't she beautiful?

50:39.621 --> 50:41.122
[Squawks]

50:41.289 --> 50:43.333
[quacks softly]

50:45.293 --> 50:46.670
- [Deeps, coos] [Humpty sighs]

50:46.836 --> 50:50.006
[cooing]
- Oh!

50:50.173 --> 50:52.551
Oh... My sweet darling.

50:52.717 --> 50:56.096
[Humpty giggles]
- I think she likes you.

50:56.263 --> 50:59.182
[monstrous roar] [gasping]

50:59.349 --> 51:00.642
[whispering] Let's just take her.

51:00.809 --> 51:02.602
Wait a minute.
This is the goose of legend.

51:02.769 --> 51:04.396
We don't know what happens
if we take her.

51:04.563 --> 51:05.564
[roaring]

51:05.730 --> 51:08.984
I know what happens
if we don't take her, we got nothing.

51:09.150 --> 51:13.280
Guys, guys. It's a gold peeper.
We're taking it!

51:13.446 --> 51:16.825
[squawking] [panting]

51:16.992 --> 51:20.704
[thudding steps]

51:22.998 --> 51:24.124
Almost there!

51:25.709 --> 51:26.876
[gasping]

51:27.043 --> 51:28.044
[Humpty] Hang on!

51:28.211 --> 51:30.589
[screaming]

51:34.092 --> 51:35.218
Hang on!

51:41.391 --> 51:44.436
- Ow!
[Humpty shrieking]

51:44.603 --> 51:46.146
- Whoa!
[chirps]

51:46.313 --> 51:48.273
[groaning]

51:48.440 --> 51:50.483
[monstrous roar]

51:56.239 --> 51:57.616
[Humpty] It's coming!

51:57.782 --> 51:59.326
Run!

52:05.832 --> 52:07.834
[shrieking]

52:10.295 --> 52:11.296
[gasps]

52:12.714 --> 52:14.966
[grunts, groans]

52:15.133 --> 52:16.343
Kitty!

52:18.595 --> 52:20.221
What are you doing?

52:21.348 --> 52:22.349
[yells]

52:29.272 --> 52:32.108
[squawking] [shouting]

52:42.911 --> 52:45.705
[Puss] Hang on!
[Kitty] Whoa!

52:48.708 --> 52:50.085
Come here, you.

52:53.963 --> 52:54.964
Go'¬£ you!

52:56.424 --> 52:57.884
She's mine now!

52:58.718 --> 53:01.638
[monstrous roar]

53:06.393 --> 53:07.769
[grunting]

53:07.936 --> 53:09.562
Hello!

53:10.522 --> 53:11.523
[shouts]

53:14.943 --> 53:18.113
Oh, no! Fly, little gosling, fly!

53:18.279 --> 53:20.907
[Humpty screaming]

53:22.283 --> 53:25.161
No! It's not supposed to be this way!

53:27.163 --> 53:28.832
- Puss?
- No.

53:30.917 --> 53:32.961
[Humpty sighs]

53:33.128 --> 53:35.004
[laughs] [grunts]

53:35.171 --> 53:36.881
[Humpty screaming]

53:37.048 --> 53:39.008
Uh... I'm sorry. [chuckles]

53:39.175 --> 53:40.176
Hmm.

53:46.766 --> 53:49.728
[laughing]

53:54.649 --> 53:56.484
Thanks, Ginger.

53:59.487 --> 54:01.906
[peeps softly]

54:02.073 --> 54:05.118
Um, we should maybe cut that down.

54:06.119 --> 54:07.662
[distant squealing]

54:09.122 --> 54:10.373
[Jill] Look at that.

54:10.540 --> 54:12.459
You finally got
that family you wanted, Jack.

54:12.625 --> 54:14.878
[grunts]
- Did you hear that?

54:15.044 --> 54:16.379
I think he just called me Daddy.

54:16.546 --> 54:20.884
- Oh! He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

54:22.385 --> 54:26.681
[grunts] [squealing]

54:31.436 --> 54:34.189
[Jill] Well, what is it?
[boar squeals]

54:34.355 --> 54:36.274
[rumbling]

54:36.441 --> 54:37.692
Huh?

54:39.986 --> 54:41.988
[boars squeal]

54:44.032 --> 54:47.327
- I do believe that's our cue.
[boar squeals]

54:47.494 --> 54:49.162
[Jack] Hah!

54:51.706 --> 54:53.333
[Puss and Humpty]
To paying back San Ricardo!

54:53.917 --> 54:55.460
To being rich!

54:55.627 --> 54:56.753
<i>Ol√©!</i>

54:57.587 --> 55:00.256
[flamenco music playing]

55:03.676 --> 55:06.513
[rhythmic clanking] [laughing]

55:07.472 --> 55:09.682
Ha! Ha!

55:09.849 --> 55:12.393
[chuckles] You.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.978
Me?

55:14.145 --> 55:16.314
Yeah, yeah, baby! [grunts]

55:18.316 --> 55:20.151
[Humpty] One, two, cha-cha-cha!

55:20.318 --> 55:22.779
Three, four, cha-cha-cha! One, two...

55:22.946 --> 55:24.280
[peeps]
- What?!

55:26.032 --> 55:30.036
There is one word for you,
Kitty Softpaws: Me-wow!

55:30.203 --> 55:32.622
I know you have quite
a reputation with the ladies,

55:32.789 --> 55:35.124
Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

55:35.333 --> 55:38.127
I've also been known as the...
Furry Lover!

55:38.294 --> 55:39.587
[grunts]

55:40.505 --> 55:42.549
But that was before I met you.

55:42.715 --> 55:43.967
You don't know me, Puss.

55:44.133 --> 55:47.762
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm all about the score.

55:47.929 --> 55:49.973
Come on. Look me in the eyes

55:50.139 --> 55:52.851
and tell me all you
care about is the gold.

55:53.935 --> 55:56.938
- Puss...
- Kitty...

55:57.105 --> 55:58.398
[Deeps]
- Oh, my God!

55:58.565 --> 55:59.983
[both hissing]

56:00.149 --> 56:02.610
[laughing] New partners!

56:02.777 --> 56:05.280
[hushed] Do not fall
for his animal magnetism.

56:05.446 --> 56:06.531
You stay focused.

56:07.407 --> 56:08.783
- Ah!
' What?!

56:09.742 --> 56:11.202
[Kitty giggles]

56:12.495 --> 56:14.831
[rhythmic clanking]

56:17.333 --> 56:20.628
[clears throat] So... I have
been thinking, Miss Softpaws,

56:20.795 --> 56:24.591
that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

56:24.757 --> 56:26.259
together.

56:28.303 --> 56:30.513
Puss, you have to go, now.

56:30.680 --> 56:33.099
You do not have to push me away any more.

56:33.266 --> 56:35.226
- You can trust me.
- But...

56:35.393 --> 56:37.145
Give it up for the legends
of San Ricardo,

56:37.312 --> 56:39.606
Humpty and Puss! We did it!

56:39.772 --> 56:41.733
[laughing]

56:41.900 --> 56:45.320
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty! Stay up with us.

56:45.486 --> 56:49.282
No, I feel a... [coughs]
hairball coming on.

56:50.199 --> 56:52.994
OK, yeah.
Have fun with that!

56:53.161 --> 56:55.204
We should give her some privacy.

56:57.707 --> 57:00.251
I never thought we would get to here.

57:01.502 --> 57:03.880
After all we went through...

57:04.047 --> 57:06.382
to pull this off, together.

57:08.301 --> 57:10.595
It is good to have my brother back.

57:11.220 --> 57:14.265
Yep. Sure is.

57:14.432 --> 57:16.935
[yawns] Well, we have
a big day tomorrow.

57:17.101 --> 57:20.188
[grunts] Pretty exciting stuff.

57:20.355 --> 57:21.731
We should get some rest.

57:23.232 --> 57:26.611
- Good night, Humpty.
[quacking, cooing]

57:32.158 --> 57:33.576
- Canasta!
[thumps]

57:40.708 --> 57:43.378
[cawing]

57:58.643 --> 58:00.311
[groans]

58:02.772 --> 58:03.982
[Squawks]

58:04.148 --> 58:07.026
[screams] I am still alive!

58:07.193 --> 58:09.028
[cawing]

58:10.071 --> 58:11.197
[gasps]

58:12.448 --> 58:14.450
Jack and Jill.

58:15.743 --> 58:16.744
Kitty?

58:17.537 --> 58:18.579
Humpty?

58:20.957 --> 58:22.792
I will find you.

58:23.292 --> 58:24.711
[Caws]

58:27.505 --> 58:29.340
- Get out of here!
[squawks]

58:43.229 --> 58:45.815
[grunts] [whinnies]

58:59.328 --> 59:00.955
[horse nickers]

59:05.710 --> 59:07.128
[sighs]

59:10.548 --> 59:12.175
[grunting]

59:15.303 --> 59:16.637
Huh?

59:19.474 --> 59:21.225
[grunting]

59:23.102 --> 59:24.437
Be gone!

59:26.022 --> 59:29.484
[Humpty] What do you want?
Gold? I have gold!

59:29.650 --> 59:32.487
[Jill laughs]
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

59:32.653 --> 59:34.280
[Jack chuckling] With our own gold.

59:34.447 --> 59:36.407
[Jill] Come on now, all we want
is a little breakfast.

59:36.574 --> 59:37.742
[Humpty] No, no, please!

59:37.909 --> 59:39.577
[Jack] How do you like
your eggs, pumpkin?

59:39.744 --> 59:41.162
Humpty, no!

59:41.788 --> 59:43.831
[Humpty screams]

59:43.998 --> 59:46.375
[cackles]

59:46.542 --> 59:49.087
[sighs] Hello, Puss.

59:49.253 --> 59:50.880
[all] Surprise!

59:51.047 --> 59:53.007
[laughing]

59:54.050 --> 59:55.134
What is going on?

59:55.301 --> 59:59.305
It's a surprise party,
and the surprise is on you.

59:59.472 --> 01:00:02.058
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:03.684
You were in cahoots?!

01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:06.312
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:13.528
I spent a lot of time in prison
preparing for this.

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:16.531
- You set me up.
- Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:21.035
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

01:00:21.202 --> 01:00:25.665
This little adventure
was about one thing.

01:00:26.624 --> 01:00:27.959
Revenge.

01:00:29.168 --> 01:00:35.133
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there. [echoing]

01:00:55.236 --> 01:00:59.031
You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss?
Well, so did I.

01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:02.118
- Why would you do this?
- You left me on that bridge!

01:01:02.285 --> 01:01:04.370
You abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

01:01:04.537 --> 01:01:07.165
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:09.417
Well, now you're finally
gonna know what it feels like,

01:01:09.584 --> 01:01:12.336
you know, to trust someone
and have them stab you in the back.

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:14.297
Guards!

01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:19.260
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

01:01:19.427 --> 01:01:21.429
Consider this the final
meeting of Bean Club.

01:01:21.596 --> 01:01:24.182
- I should scramble you with onions!
[shrieks]

01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:26.767
You should never have come back.

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:31.355
[growls]
[lmelda] Peque√±o! Wait.

01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:33.649
Do not fight them, please.

01:01:33.816 --> 01:01:36.611
Mama! Listen to me. I can explain.

01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:41.199
No. Puss, no more running.

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:45.494
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:50.291
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:53.044
I let you down.

01:01:55.922 --> 01:01:57.924
Paws where we can see them!

01:01:59.091 --> 01:02:01.093
Turn around... slow.

01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:04.764
Slower!

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:14.523
Step into the carrier... quiet-like.

01:02:22.698 --> 01:02:23.908
Attention! Attention, everyone!

01:02:24.075 --> 01:02:26.285
If you could just come in
a little closer.

01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:27.995
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:31.499
I present to you...
the Golden Goose of legend!

01:02:31.666 --> 01:02:34.210
[peeping]
[crowd gasping, chattering]

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.632
Kitty. Not you, too?

01:02:44.262 --> 01:02:46.847
[Humpty laughs] Gold for everyone!

01:02:47.014 --> 01:02:49.433
Boo! Boo! Boo! [cackles]

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.228
We got some fresh,
hot gold here, people!

01:02:52.395 --> 01:02:56.691
Step right up! Get it hot!

01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:59.193
<i>[crowd] Huevos! Huevos! Huevos!</i>

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:08.619
One hat.

01:03:08.786 --> 01:03:10.913
One belt.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.332
And two boots...

01:03:13.499 --> 01:03:16.294
once a symbol of honor.

01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:20.256
One bottle of catnip?

01:03:20.423 --> 01:03:23.426
Uh... it is for my glaucoma.

01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:26.554
[yowls] [door slams]

01:03:27.346 --> 01:03:30.599
This is where you belong, outlaw.

01:03:30.766 --> 01:03:35.479
And this is
where you will stay... forever.

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:42.528
[sighs]

01:03:50.286 --> 01:03:52.455
[man] Whoo-hoo!
[shrieks]

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:55.541
No, no. Don't stop on my account.

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:11.766
Well, it looks like the egg
got what he wanted.

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:13.726
You're talking about Humpty?

01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:15.478
[babbles] Don't say his name!

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:19.231
I used to share this cell
with that smelly thing.

01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:22.443
Happiest day of my life was
when he left.

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:25.196
Till I realized he stole my magic beans.

01:04:25.363 --> 01:04:28.407
Wait, wait, wait!
You had the beans? Who are you?

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:31.452
[snores]
- Hey! What's your name?

01:04:31.619 --> 01:04:34.163
[screams] Andy Beanstalk!

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:36.248
My friends call me Jack.

01:04:36.415 --> 01:04:39.627
I traded the family cow for them beans.

01:04:39.794 --> 01:04:41.629
Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow.

01:04:41.796 --> 01:04:44.799
It was some other family's family cow.
That's why I got eight to ten.

01:04:44.965 --> 01:04:49.053
Always know which cow is yours.

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.514
[snores]
- Crazy man. Wake up!

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.266
[gasps]
- What else do you know?

01:04:54.433 --> 01:04:58.354
We're all goners,
thanks to that little stinky!

01:04:58.521 --> 01:05:03.567
I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:05.945
Don't take the goose. Why?

01:05:06.112 --> 01:05:08.072
[Shores] [groans]

01:05:08.239 --> 01:05:13.452
[gasps] The Great Terror!
That's the Golden Goose's mama.

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:14.870
Oh, no.

01:05:15.037 --> 01:05:17.706
And she will be out for blood

01:05:17.873 --> 01:05:21.377
when she comes back for her baby.

01:05:21.544 --> 01:05:22.962
[gasps] Guard!

01:05:23.129 --> 01:05:26.215
San Ricardo is in terrible danger!
You must listen to me!

01:05:26.382 --> 01:05:27.383
Quiet, you!

01:05:40.062 --> 01:05:42.356
[Puss yowling]

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.611
[yowling continuing]

01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:53.325
[groans] Shut up.

01:05:54.869 --> 01:05:58.456
[yowling] [groans angrily]

01:06:00.249 --> 01:06:04.670
- Shh!
[growls]

01:06:06.922 --> 01:06:09.341
[purring] [gasps]

01:06:10.593 --> 01:06:13.095
Open the door.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.062
Drop the weapon.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.191
Very good.

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:27.526
Step aside.

01:06:28.194 --> 01:06:29.862
No. [grunts]

01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:31.655
- Diablo Gato!
[gasps]

01:06:32.573 --> 01:06:34.658
Nice try. [snickers]

01:06:35.409 --> 01:06:37.119
[muffled scream]

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:39.580
Huh?

01:06:46.795 --> 01:06:48.547
I hope you can forgive me.

01:06:48.714 --> 01:06:51.175
Apology accepted!

01:06:52.593 --> 01:06:54.553
I don't really have time for you.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.805
I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

01:06:56.972 --> 01:06:58.849
Wait, Puss!

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:01.018
Don't you see? I'm here because...

01:07:02.353 --> 01:07:04.522
I am here because you made me realize

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:08.234
that there is something
I care about more than gold.

01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:10.653
Something?

01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:13.989
OK. Someone.

01:07:14.156 --> 01:07:16.700
He's about two feet tall,
wears high heels.

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.327
Handsome?

01:07:18.494 --> 01:07:20.496
He's very handsome.

01:07:20.663 --> 01:07:22.581
- A real beefcake?
- Mm-hm.

01:07:22.748 --> 01:07:24.041
- A stallion?
- Yes.

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.960
- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

01:07:26.126 --> 01:07:29.213
[chuckles] But this
does not make us even.

01:07:30.005 --> 01:07:32.466
- Freeze!
- Yes, it does.

01:07:32.633 --> 01:07:34.426
- No, no, no, it doesn't.
[whimpers]

01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:36.303
[both yowling]

01:07:36.679 --> 01:07:38.013
[screams]

01:07:38.806 --> 01:07:39.848
I saved you!

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.184
You owed me one.

01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:44.812
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

01:07:47.189 --> 01:07:48.524
So now you owe me two.

01:07:51.443 --> 01:07:53.028
[guards shouting]

01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:55.823
- You're a lot of work.
- I know. But I am worth it!

01:07:56.615 --> 01:07:57.616
Ha-ha!

01:08:00.452 --> 01:08:02.871
You are not getting away, Puss In Boots!

01:08:03.539 --> 01:08:05.040
Wrong boots.

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:07.126
Kitty!

01:08:07.293 --> 01:08:09.503
Now we're even! [yowls]

01:08:17.386 --> 01:08:19.971
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:22.850
Chances of a giant goose
destroying the town...

01:08:23.017 --> 01:08:24.977
one hundred percent.

01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:32.568
<i>[Puss] Never alone,
always together...</i>

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:33.986
<i>[Humpty] Humpty and Puss...</i>

01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:35.738
<i>[both] Brothers forever.</i>

01:08:35.904 --> 01:08:38.448
[sighs] [peeping]

01:08:38.616 --> 01:08:40.158
Come on, sweetie.

01:08:40.326 --> 01:08:42.578
Let's, uh, get out of here
before Mama shows up.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:46.832
I should make you
into an egg salad sandwich!

01:08:46.999 --> 01:08:49.585
[shrieks] That is disgusting!

01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:53.255
- Give me the goose, Humpty.
- No can do, I'm afraid.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:55.299
See, the mama's on her way,
and when she gets here,

01:08:55.466 --> 01:08:59.345
it's bye-bye San Ricardo and
everything you ever cared about!

01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:03.932
[scoffs] Revenge on me is one thing,
but why Imelda? Why the orphanage?

01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.725
This is our home.

01:09:05.893 --> 01:09:07.728
You mean your home.

01:09:07.895 --> 01:09:12.024
[sighs] I never belonged here.

01:09:12.191 --> 01:09:13.567
We had a plan to get out of here,

01:09:13.734 --> 01:09:16.779
but then you became a hero and
you picked this place over me.

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:17.946
[sighs]

01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:21.033
You left me with nothing.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:28.707
Humpty... I'm sorry I hurt you.

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:33.295
But do not take it out on these people.

01:09:33.462 --> 01:09:35.130
You are better than this!

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:38.676
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, come on!

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.551
I know the real Humpty.

01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:44.848
The way you saw the world!
The inventor! The dreamer!

01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:47.518
What happened to that guy?

01:09:47.685 --> 01:09:50.770
[distant roaring]

01:09:50.938 --> 01:09:52.523
[wings flapping]

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.150
I... I think it's too late.

01:09:55.317 --> 01:09:57.611
It is never too late
to do the right thing.

01:09:57.778 --> 01:10:00.155
Together we can save San Ricardo!

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:09.456
I can forgive you, Humpty...
if you help me now.

01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:11.709
Really?

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:14.294
After everything I put you through?

01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:17.256
Prove to me there is still
a good egg in you.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.051
<i>I'll</i> try.

01:10:23.011 --> 01:10:24.138
[gasping]

- You can't save us both.
- Yes, I can! Just hang on!

01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:12.009
Puss, you have to save the baby,
or the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:15.762
It's the right thing to do.

01:15:19.224 --> 01:15:21.893
I will not let you go, Humpty.

01:15:22.978 --> 01:15:24.104
I know you won't.

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:27.399

- Yeah, I think it's wonderful...
- And I got a goose egg.

01:16:56.738 --> 01:16:58.323
It's him. Puss In Boots.

01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:00.325
He saved us from the giant goose!

01:17:00.492 --> 01:17:02.410
His sword is like lightning!

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:04.371
They say he has ten lives.

01:17:04.538 --> 01:17:08.416
His boots are made
of the finest Corinthian leather.

01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:10.877
He only drinks whole milk.

01:17:14.381 --> 01:17:15.674
<i>Good leche.</i>

01:17:15.841 --> 01:17:19.136
He's no outlaw. He saved us!

01:17:19.928 --> 01:17:21.847
[Puss] Uh, meow?

01:17:23.515 --> 01:17:26.059
A gift for you, Mama.

01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:32.732
I have to go.
The soldiers are coming for me.

- I am so proud of you, my son.

01:17:39.948 --> 01:17:44.578
Today, you faced the past
with bravery and honor.

01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:47.414
You earned those boots.

01:17:47.581 --> 01:17:52.586
And the people know that you are
San Ricardo's greatest hero.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.463
I did it for you, Mama.

01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:59.384
You will always be in my heart.

01:17:59.551 --> 01:18:01.761
And you in mine.

01:18:04.264 --> 01:18:06.391
