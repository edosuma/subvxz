bought the fundraising table
for two reasons.

14:45.465 --> 14:48.642
First, we love Mayor Bradley,
and want to keep him

14:48.816 --> 14:50.253
right where he is.

14:50.427 --> 14:52.864
And second...

14:53.038 --> 14:54.910
to get your attention.

14:55.084 --> 14:57.390
Oh, well, you've got it.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.002
Though I'm still
a little uncertain as to

15:00.176 --> 15:02.526
how I even came to yours.

15:02.700 --> 15:06.312
I've been working in real estate
for 17 years.

15:06.486 --> 15:08.227
Your name has continually
come up

15:08.401 --> 15:10.360
in connection with large...

15:10.534 --> 15:13.015
very large deals
in real estate development

15:13.189 --> 15:15.060
and local politics.

15:15.234 --> 15:16.627
When you back a project,

15:16.801 --> 15:18.846
city council almost always
votes your way.

15:19.021 --> 15:21.414
Well, that's just a lifetime
of cultivating relationships

15:21.588 --> 15:25.418
that have the potential
to move business forward.

15:25.592 --> 15:29.074
That's exactly why I'm here.

15:29.248 --> 15:30.815
I think I may be able
to help you.

15:30.989 --> 15:34.732
Oh?
How so, exactly?

15:34.906 --> 15:37.213
In the last year,
my son and I have been

15:37.387 --> 15:41.086
-acquiring commercial properties
in South Central Los Angeles.
-Mm.

15:41.260 --> 15:44.829
As you well know, in order
to maximize a property's value,

15:45.003 --> 15:46.744
it's essential to understand
the comps

15:46.918 --> 15:49.399
and the competition.

15:51.227 --> 15:53.620
Four years ago, your company,

15:53.794 --> 15:57.059
backed mostly by bank loans,

15:57.233 --> 15:59.539
started buying up properties
in Leimert Park.

15:59.713 --> 16:04.283
Building what you called
the Eastside Business Complex.

16:04.457 --> 16:06.894
But you underestimated
local resistance,

16:07.069 --> 16:08.461
and despite your connections,

16:08.635 --> 16:11.073
the process has been
dragging on.

16:11.247 --> 16:13.945
You've been hemorrhaging cash
to the tune of about 13%

16:14.119 --> 16:16.208
while you try to push
the final few holdouts

16:16.382 --> 16:18.254
out of your way.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.477
And I'll bet you're here
dangling your son's drug money

16:24.651 --> 16:25.783
to bail me out.

16:25.957 --> 16:27.263
Hmm? Is that it?

16:29.395 --> 16:32.485
My son is no longer
in that business.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.187
You've come this far,

16:38.361 --> 16:41.842
angling to get yourself
into my business.

16:44.715 --> 16:47.631
So I need to ask you...

16:47.805 --> 16:50.112
what is it you want, Cissy?

16:58.381 --> 17:00.470
[phone ringing nearby]

17:10.697 --> 17:13.483
Is there anything at all
that you want to say?

17:16.529 --> 17:18.053
Guess I should have known.

17:18.227 --> 17:21.491
Yeah, I sort of figured
shipping guns

17:21.665 --> 17:24.059
to Central America
would have tipped it.

17:31.805 --> 17:33.938
You know, the good news is

17:34.112 --> 17:35.722
it means you're protected.

17:37.811 --> 17:39.683
Protected by a government
that sells coca

17:39.857 --> 17:41.859
to their own people, hmm?

17:43.948 --> 17:45.732
How many people you know

17:45.906 --> 17:48.039
kill a DEA agent
and get away with it?

17:54.393 --> 17:56.830
I'll stay with you as long as
we kill the people

17:57.004 --> 17:58.876
that killed my family.

18:03.010 --> 18:04.708
[door unlocks, opens]

18:04.882 --> 18:06.884
WOMAN:
Teddy McDonald?

18:11.715 --> 18:14.065
Teddy McDonald.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.416
These men crossed the border
yesterday evening at 5:23.

18:17.590 --> 18:20.027
They returned less than
two hours later. We believe

18:20.202 --> 18:21.768
they are the ones
who killed your assets.

18:23.379 --> 18:24.989
You know where they live?

18:25.163 --> 18:26.556
Of course.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.036
Fuentes?
The men?

18:29.211 --> 18:30.908
Sí.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.042
I've been instructed
to provide local support

18:35.217 --> 18:37.480
with some conditions.

18:37.654 --> 18:40.874
No violence here in Tijuana.
No executions.

18:41.048 --> 18:45.879
No shooting up private homes
or, say, a police station.

18:46.053 --> 18:48.230
You know what these people did?

18:48.404 --> 18:50.319
I do.

18:50.493 --> 18:52.582
What else do you have
on Fuentes?

18:55.150 --> 18:58.109
There are a few options.
Ideally, we should isolate him.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.333
This, uh, his house
near San Vicente

19:04.507 --> 19:05.943
on the ocean-- is it secluded?

19:06.117 --> 19:07.988
Secluded and fortified.

19:08.163 --> 19:09.990
He'll go there
if he feels cornered.

19:10.165 --> 19:12.384
We can use informants,
have word trickle down

19:12.558 --> 19:14.517
that the CIA
has him in its sights.

19:14.691 --> 19:16.606
Our intel indicates
he would take men with him

19:16.780 --> 19:18.477
for protection,
likely the same ones

19:18.651 --> 19:20.131
that killed your assets.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.308
Could take a little while
to have word leak.

19:23.482 --> 19:24.570
We do have
some time constraints.

19:24.744 --> 19:26.790
GUSTAVO:
We need to scare him.

19:28.618 --> 19:30.750

is why do you

Because that way you become
a part of the corporation.

27:40.631 --> 27:43.590
