WEBVTT

00:05.176 --> 00:07.088
Avery, that's
so beautiful.

00:07.088 --> 00:08.839
Thank you.

00:08.839 --> 00:10.841
I designed it for
tonight's big fashion show.

00:10.841 --> 00:13.344
It's a huge opportunity
for me to promote my designs.

00:13.344 --> 00:15.436
And no, you can't put on
my dress and play

00:15.436 --> 00:17.017
tiny red-headed
Avery again,

00:17.017 --> 00:19.400
'cause that was just weird.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.562
Me, play dress-up?

00:21.562 --> 00:23.444
Please. I'm nine.

00:23.444 --> 00:25.736
I'm almost double-digits,
Avery.

00:25.736 --> 00:27.318
Drink that in.

00:27.318 --> 00:30.151
I have worked for weeks
on this dress.

00:30.151 --> 00:31.742
It is perfect.

00:31.742 --> 00:34.155
When I look at it,
I feel a sense of calm.

00:34.155 --> 00:36.207
[shrieks]
She has a unibrow!

00:36.207 --> 00:38.249
Oh, it's just
a piece of lint.

00:42.213 --> 00:44.125
What is this, hon?

00:44.125 --> 00:45.336
I didn't order anything.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.088
Maybe it's my new
pirate grill.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.170
It's like a regular grill,
but the ad really got me

00:49.170 --> 00:51.592
when they said you could make
ham-barghh-ers.

00:53.134 --> 00:55.266
Oh.

00:55.266 --> 00:59.140
Salami, prosciutto,
summer sausage.

00:59.140 --> 01:01.182
It's a deli basket.

01:01.182 --> 01:03.144
But there's no card.

01:03.144 --> 01:05.946
Oh, maybe one of
my patients has developed

01:05.946 --> 01:08.068
a case of compulsive
gift-giving.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.691
I'll cure him slowly.

01:10.691 --> 01:13.033
We should take
this basket
for a picnic.

01:13.033 --> 01:16.657
I have the afternoon free
since my Pilates instructor
tried to kill me.

01:16.657 --> 01:18.579
Or maybe I got stuck
in the machine.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.371
The point is, I'm not
allowed back there.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.416
Has anyone seen
my dress?

01:25.416 --> 01:28.299
Freddy, Gracie?

01:28.299 --> 01:29.260
What are you guys up to?

01:29.260 --> 01:31.091
We're playing tennis.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.804
What's tennis, Avery?

01:37.017 --> 01:38.479
Oh, no.

01:38.479 --> 01:40.721
No. No, it can't be.

01:42.273 --> 01:46.106
What has someone done
to my dress?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.439
No!!

02:05.546 --> 02:08.379
With no time to fix her dress
before the fashion show,

02:08.379 --> 02:10.341
Avery had to withdraw.

02:10.341 --> 02:12.513
So she put all her energy
into solving

02:12.513 --> 02:15.015
the case of
the ruined dress.

02:15.015 --> 02:16.717
Although, if it's
a mystery,

02:16.717 --> 02:18.759
maybe I should blog like
a detective.

02:18.759 --> 02:20.891
Murdered dress lay there

02:20.891 --> 02:23.894
like a fog over
the Pasadena pier.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.767
Pasadena doesn't
have a pier,

02:26.767 --> 02:28.399
but that doesn't matter.

02:28.399 --> 02:31.732
It's just another day
in the 'dena.

02:31.732 --> 02:34.985
How could someone ruin
my beautiful dress?

02:34.985 --> 02:37.578
The fabric's faded,
there are blue smudges,

02:37.578 --> 02:39.740
and someone
painted over it.

02:39.740 --> 02:42.203
Things like this aren't
supposed to happen in the 'dena.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.875
And why did I just
call it the 'dena?

02:44.875 --> 02:46.877
That's what happens
in the 'dena.

02:46.877 --> 02:48.589
It changes you.

02:48.589 --> 02:50.751
You start calling it
the 'dena.

02:52.293 --> 02:54.345
One second, Avery.

02:54.345 --> 02:56.176
Don't worry, kid.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.928
Savannah Snoops,
kid detective,

02:57.928 --> 03:00.511
star of the book series
Savannah Snoops, Kid Detective,

03:00.511 --> 03:02.603
is on the case.

03:02.603 --> 03:04.184
Chloe--

03:04.184 --> 03:07.107
Just a second.
I have to play her in.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.442

03:15.816 --> 03:18.819
Chloe, my dress was
really important to me,

03:18.819 --> 03:20.951
and someone destroyed it.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.122
This is serious.

03:22.122 --> 03:23.954
I need to figure out
who did this.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.957
It's pretty obvious
the puppies did it.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.169
Case solved.

03:36.837 --> 03:39.970
No, the puppies were
just as surprised as I was

03:39.970 --> 03:41.392
when we dug up the dress.

03:41.392 --> 03:45.185
Okay, Savannah's
back on the case.

03:45.185 --> 03:47.648
I already got suspects.

03:47.648 --> 03:50.020
Red pony, blue pony.

03:50.020 --> 03:51.652
Green pony, pink pony.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.195
And I also suspect
a dolphin,

03:55.195 --> 03:56.657
but I can only
draw ponies,

03:56.657 --> 03:59.950
so the dolphin's
gonna walk.

03:59.950 --> 04:03.454
As much as I appreciate
your unintentional commentary

04:03.454 --> 04:06.497
on the arbitrary nature
of our criminal justice system,

04:06.497 --> 04:08.709
this is not helping.

04:08.709 --> 04:11.041
Kid, I've solved
47 cases

04:11.041 --> 04:12.923
in ten easy-to-read books.

04:12.923 --> 04:15.426
I think I know
what I'm doing.

04:18.679 --> 04:20.681
Look, our neighbors,
the Wallaces,

04:20.681 --> 04:22.222
are having a picnic, too.

04:22.222 --> 04:25.306
He's always
copying me, hon.

04:25.306 --> 04:28.188
I got golf clubs,
he got golf clubs.

04:28.188 --> 04:30.441
I married a gorgeous,
statuesque blonde,

04:30.441 --> 04:32.983
he married a gorgeous,
statuesque blonde.

04:32.983 --> 04:35.316
- You think she's pretty?
- What?

04:35.316 --> 04:37.157
I don't notice
that sort of stuff.

04:37.157 --> 04:39.239
Is that even a woman?

04:41.902 --> 04:43.163
[both] Oh, hi.

04:43.163 --> 04:45.666
Look at them
copying us.

04:45.666 --> 04:48.409
We wave and
they wave back.
When does it end?

04:48.409 --> 04:51.251
We should have another
kid and see what they do.

04:53.714 --> 04:55.916
So who's ready
for a picnic?

04:58.919 --> 05:00.921
Where's our salami?

05:00.921 --> 05:02.763
Our salami's gone.

05:02.763 --> 05:05.556
The Wallaces
have a salami.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.519
We had our backs to them
when we were at the drink cart.

05:08.519 --> 05:11.642
They have gone from
copycatting to stealing.

05:11.642 --> 05:13.313
I'm gonna go over
there and talk to them.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.235
Hurry. I'm pre-salivating.

05:15.235 --> 05:17.067
I don't wanna waste it.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.110
Hey, Dean, June.

05:20.110 --> 05:23.824
Wow, that is
a nice-looking
salami you got there.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.156
We had one just like that.

05:26.156 --> 05:28.499
So maybe you could keep
your eyes out

05:28.499 --> 05:32.252
for a salami that looks
exactly like that one.

05:33.794 --> 05:35.416
Look, we're just over here

05:35.416 --> 05:38.048
minding our own business,
like normal people do.

05:38.048 --> 05:40.591
We're having another kid.
Your move.

05:42.302 --> 05:44.134
Look out.
The remote's jammed.

05:47.518 --> 05:50.350
Bennett, what
are you doing?
Just move.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.773
My legs are too scared
to move.

05:58.318 --> 06:00.150
Oh, my hamstring.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.743
If this keeps you
out of bike shorts
this summer,

06:02.743 --> 06:05.446
I will never
forgive them.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.370
There's a break
in the case.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.704
I can draw a dolphin.

06:13.704 --> 06:15.085
All right, Chloe.

06:15.085 --> 06:17.838
You follow that lead
as far as it takes you.

06:17.838 --> 06:20.591
If I'm gonna figure out
who ruined the dress,

06:20.591 --> 06:22.713
I need to think about
who had a motive.

06:22.713 --> 06:24.885
And I know who that is.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.267
I know it was you.

06:32.222 --> 06:34.605
You were mad at me,
and you hated the dress.

06:34.605 --> 06:36.607
That's why you
ruined it.

06:38.228 --> 06:40.150
I would never do that.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.823
Don't you remember
the argument we had earlier?

06:42.823 --> 06:44.194
No, Avery, I don't remember

06:44.194 --> 06:45.486
what I had for breakfast
this morning.

06:45.486 --> 06:47.197
My burps
taste like pickle.

06:47.197 --> 06:48.829
Could that be a clue?
I don't know,

06:48.829 --> 06:49.990
but if you wanna
solve a mystery,

06:49.990 --> 06:51.702
there's your mystery.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.244
Tyler, I don't care about
what you had for breakfast,

06:54.244 --> 06:56.206
except that it's
balanced and nutritious,

06:56.206 --> 06:58.248
because it's the most
important meal of the day.

06:58.248 --> 07:01.882
That is right, I can accuse
and educate at the same time.

07:01.882 --> 07:04.384
This is about when you
got angry at me this morning.

07:04.384 --> 07:06.136
You've been spending
so much time

07:06.136 --> 07:08.308
on that stupid dress,
you didn't help me

07:08.308 --> 07:10.350
fix my uniform
like you promised.

07:12.012 --> 07:15.516
So I did have a pickle
for breakfast.

07:15.516 --> 07:17.728
But that doesn't prove
I wrecked your dress.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.480
You know what?
You're right.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.321
Maybe I just
jumped to conclusions.

07:21.321 --> 07:23.273
Just one more thing;
this probably isn't
even important.

07:23.273 --> 07:25.946
But was this shirt
always pink?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.780
Yes, and you can't
prove otherwise.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.742
Oh, really?

07:31.742 --> 07:33.784
What about this selfie
on your Buddy Bop page?

07:33.784 --> 07:35.996
This is the same shirt,
and it was white.

07:35.996 --> 07:38.789
I said that selfies
would one day be my downfall.

07:38.789 --> 07:40.170
It's a selfie-fulfilling
prophecy.

07:42.082 --> 07:44.545
You put my dress
in the washing machine

07:44.545 --> 07:47.007
to ruin it.
That's how it got faded.

07:47.007 --> 07:49.680
Then the red from my dress
bled onto your white shirt,

07:49.680 --> 07:51.181
turning it pink.

07:51.181 --> 07:53.393
If my shirt got washed
with your dress,

07:53.393 --> 07:55.145
someone else
must've done it.

07:55.145 --> 07:57.307
The last time I saw your dress,
it was hanging in your closet.

07:57.307 --> 07:59.099
I took a sewing kit
off of your dresser

07:59.099 --> 08:00.360
to sew up my uniform.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.733
And I did a pretty
darn good job.

08:04.194 --> 08:07.107
Oh, that's where
the rest of my pickle went.

08:07.107 --> 08:10.991
Wait. My sewing kit shouldn't
have been on my dresser.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.372
I always keep it
in my closet.

08:12.372 --> 08:14.164
Keeps me from
sleep-sewing.

08:14.164 --> 08:15.956
It's very disconcerting
to wake up

08:15.956 --> 08:19.249
in a nightgown sewn from
towels and toilet paper.

08:19.249 --> 08:23.253
But this might be a clue
as to who destroyed my dress.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.546
When I heard my sewing kit
was on my dresser,

08:25.546 --> 08:28.128
I got suspicious,

08:28.128 --> 08:30.551
because it had been
in my closet blocking my dress.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.553
Someone who wanted
to destroy my dress

08:32.553 --> 08:34.184
would've had to move
my sewing kit.

08:34.184 --> 08:36.476
I don't see what that
has to do with me.

08:36.476 --> 08:38.639
I'm innocent.
Just ask my lawyer.

08:41.061 --> 08:45.145
He's from the law firm
of Monkey, Monkey,
Monkey and Goat.

08:45.145 --> 08:47.237
Goat just made partner.

08:47.237 --> 08:50.991
[whispering] He married
Monkey's daughter.

08:50.991 --> 08:53.153
Come clean, Stan.

08:53.153 --> 08:55.155
There are bite marks
on my sewing kit.

08:55.155 --> 08:56.997
Fine, but I only moved it

08:56.997 --> 08:59.209
to get to the swim gear
in your closet.

08:59.209 --> 09:01.421
You were too busy to take
the puppies to the beach

09:01.421 --> 09:04.084
like you promised,
so I had to do it myself.

09:04.084 --> 09:06.667
I got stung by
a jellyfish.

09:06.667 --> 09:10.130
I peed on my sister.

09:10.130 --> 09:12.883
Avery, you've been so busy
with your fashion,

09:12.883 --> 09:15.095
you haven't had time
for me and my puppies.

09:15.095 --> 09:16.847
I wish your fashion
never existed.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.639
And there's your motive.

09:18.639 --> 09:22.102
I need to speak to my lawyer.
Oh, no!

09:22.102 --> 09:26.106
Whoever destroyed your dress
must've bumped off Robert.

09:27.107 --> 09:29.279
Give up the case, Avery.

09:29.279 --> 09:31.151
How many bodies
have to pile up

09:31.151 --> 09:33.904
before you say
"No more"?

09:33.904 --> 09:36.196
Pretending
your stuffed monkey is dead

09:36.196 --> 09:38.078
will not get you
out of this.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.040
I have an alibi.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.201
I was with the puppies
all day.

09:41.201 --> 09:43.253
Daddy, Daddy,
Daddy, Daddy.

09:43.253 --> 09:45.415
Daddy!

09:45.415 --> 09:48.128
What are we talking about?

09:48.128 --> 09:50.090
Yes, we were with Daddy.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.552
And Uncle Karl.

09:52.552 --> 09:54.134
He taught us words.

09:54.134 --> 10:00.140
"Nefarious," "diabolical,"
and "show-stopper."

10:00.140 --> 10:02.522
Wait, Karl was here today?

10:02.522 --> 10:04.104
I should've guessed.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.896
I'm gonna go talk to him.

10:07.397 --> 10:09.489
Freddy, you didn't
have to pee on Gracie.

10:09.489 --> 10:12.322
It's a myth that it helps
jellyfish stings.

10:12.322 --> 10:15.495
Gracie got stung
by a jellyfish?

10:19.079 --> 10:21.121
Oh, no.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.703
When we went back up
to the drink cart,

10:22.703 --> 10:24.124
someone must've taken
the mortadella.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.087
[both] The Wallaces.

10:27.087 --> 10:29.299
Maybe I can see
if they have it.

10:29.299 --> 10:32.132
These are really
powerful binoculars.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.304
June's pores
are so tiny.

10:36.256 --> 10:38.138
I mean, does she even
have skin?

10:39.850 --> 10:41.521
Oh, they're getting up.
This is our chance.

10:41.521 --> 10:43.684
You hurt your hamstring,
so I'll go over there.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.226
If anything goes wrong,
I'll make an eagle sound.

10:46.226 --> 10:48.188
- Cree!
- No.

10:48.188 --> 10:49.690
We have to be stealthy.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.072
If I see anything,
I'll make an eagle sound.

10:52.072 --> 10:54.074
Craw!

10:54.074 --> 10:56.326
And that is what
an eagle sounds like.

10:56.326 --> 10:58.658
My brother trained one
to attack me.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.292
- Craw!
- Cree!

11:12.292 --> 11:14.594
- Craw!
- Cree!

11:14.594 --> 11:17.177
Craw!

11:17.177 --> 11:19.559
Cree!

11:23.764 --> 11:25.515
All right, Karl.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.571
And that's why we knock.

11:33.153 --> 11:36.406
I know you sneaked
over to my house,
and destroyed my dress.

11:36.406 --> 11:39.159
Don't try to deny it,
because the puppies
already sold you out.

11:39.159 --> 11:40.911
Oh, nonsense. What motive
would I have

11:40.911 --> 11:42.282
for destroying your dress?

11:42.282 --> 11:44.584
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

11:44.584 --> 11:46.586
What motive could you
possibly have?

11:46.586 --> 11:48.498
After all, you love
my fashion.

11:48.498 --> 11:49.960
That's true.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.832
The fact that I'm
so devoted to it

11:51.832 --> 11:54.174
doesn't bother you
in the slightest.

11:54.174 --> 11:57.297
You are correct, madam.

11:57.297 --> 12:01.221
If I spent my entire life
doing fashion--

12:01.221 --> 12:03.263
It would be a complete
waste of your time.

12:03.263 --> 12:05.265
A frilly, pointless distraction
that would keep you from

12:05.265 --> 12:07.107
truly noble pursuits.

12:07.107 --> 12:10.150
I wish every last stitch
perished in flames!

12:10.150 --> 12:12.022
Oopsy-doo.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.855
And there's your motive.
I knew you did it.

12:14.855 --> 12:16.616
No, Avery.

12:16.616 --> 12:18.238
You're my closest friend.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.200
I wish you
only the best.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.913
And I would never
willingly harm or sabotage you.

12:22.913 --> 12:25.245
Besides, you have
no evidence, you swine.

12:26.366 --> 12:28.288
Well, I am gonna find some.

12:29.289 --> 12:33.293
Founding father
finger puppets?

12:33.293 --> 12:35.635
Sometimes, the founding
fingers like to gather

12:35.635 --> 12:39.179
and debate the merits
of a bicameral legislature.

12:39.179 --> 12:42.222
Thomas Jeffer-thumb
is quite the rabble rouser.

12:46.096 --> 12:49.059
Hey. This is my sketchbook.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.061
Let me guess.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.483
After destroying my dress,
you were also gonna destroy

12:53.483 --> 12:56.817
my sketches to squelch
my love of fashion for good.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.239
Oh, you mean, like
the Frankenstein movie

12:59.239 --> 13:01.111
where, after destroying
the monster,

13:01.111 --> 13:03.163
the villagers wanna destroy
Dr. Frankenstein's journal.

13:03.163 --> 13:05.866
Why did I just say that?
I'm not helping my case.

13:05.866 --> 13:08.458
But the analogy fits
so perfectly.

13:08.458 --> 13:11.211
I'm torn; I'm furious
at what you did,

13:11.211 --> 13:13.123
yet satisfied that
I caught you.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.375
I'm satis-furious.

13:15.375 --> 13:18.128
Avery, I didn't know
about the sketchbook.

13:18.128 --> 13:20.090
People leave things here
all the time.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.972
Mother left me in here once
when I was a child,

13:21.972 --> 13:23.683
and I sorta just
made it my own.

13:25.886 --> 13:27.387
A red hair.

13:27.387 --> 13:29.229
Chloe?

13:29.229 --> 13:32.022
Congratulations.
A breakthrough in the case.

13:32.022 --> 13:33.813
The founding fingers
would like to celebrate

13:33.813 --> 13:35.775
by doing the wave.

13:38.989 --> 13:41.071
Oh, careful,
Dr. Franklin.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.743
You're old.

13:48.158 --> 13:51.291
Chloe, I found
my sketchbook

13:51.291 --> 13:54.374
in Karl's shed,
and your hair was in it.

13:54.374 --> 13:56.957
I can't believe
you would do this.

13:56.957 --> 13:58.548
You knew how much
that dress meant to me.

14:01.171 --> 14:03.463
Chloe's making
a break for it. Get her!

14:06.306 --> 14:07.968
Get off me, Savannah.

14:10.270 --> 14:12.432
You have the right
to remain silent, Chloe.

14:14.564 --> 14:17.237
Avery, help me.
I'm still your sister.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.152
Chloe got away.

14:23.984 --> 14:26.156
But I got this blue
eye shadow from her pocket,

14:26.156 --> 14:28.368
so she'll be back,
if she ever wants

14:28.368 --> 14:30.790
her dolls to look
dramatic and mysterious again,

14:30.790 --> 14:33.954
and she does.

14:33.954 --> 14:35.665
Okay.

14:35.665 --> 14:39.259
Savannah, a detective
as brilliant as you are

14:39.259 --> 14:41.551
must have a theory
as to why Chloe would do this.

14:41.551 --> 14:43.593
Sure, Chloe loves
playing dress-up,

14:43.593 --> 14:45.555
but you can't
pin this one on her.

14:45.555 --> 14:47.267
There's no way she could've
done all that damage

14:47.267 --> 14:48.428
to the dress
on her own.

14:48.428 --> 14:50.350
Wait a minute.

14:50.350 --> 14:53.433
You're right.
I've cracked the case.

14:53.433 --> 14:55.605
Who's the sista
who's cracked the case?

14:55.605 --> 14:59.279
Avery. Pak-chika,
pak-chika, pak-chika.

14:59.279 --> 15:01.401
That's right,
my theme song's funkier.

15:04.734 --> 15:07.287
The summer sausage
is gone.

15:07.287 --> 15:09.329
How did they get
our summer sausage?

15:09.329 --> 15:13.123
We were being so careful
before our nap.

15:13.123 --> 15:15.455
We have got to get a look
inside their basket

15:15.455 --> 15:17.167
and confirm,
once and for all,

15:17.167 --> 15:19.039
that they have taken
our meats.

15:19.039 --> 15:20.420
I can't go back over there.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.252
You can't go over there,

15:22.252 --> 15:26.426
but June, who's wearing the same
sweater you have at home, can.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.758
Do I look like June?

15:28.758 --> 15:32.142
Wow! You really do.

15:32.142 --> 15:35.145
I mean, what does June
look like again?

15:35.145 --> 15:37.767
Maybe if he only
sees me from the back.

15:37.767 --> 15:39.319
Perfect.

15:39.319 --> 15:41.521
Now's your chance.
Go.

15:45.825 --> 15:47.117
June?

15:47.117 --> 15:48.828
[high-pitched voice]
Yes.

15:48.828 --> 15:50.240
- Ellen?
- No.

15:52.412 --> 15:55.285
Hi, Ellen.

15:55.285 --> 15:57.037
What is wrong
with you people?

15:57.037 --> 15:59.079
It's too late
for apologies.

16:00.670 --> 16:02.542
We know what you did,

16:02.542 --> 16:04.424
and we are not going to
let you get away with it.

16:04.424 --> 16:06.426
Ever hear of something
called payback?

16:06.426 --> 16:08.588
Well, get ready for
a big, steaming slice of it.

16:08.588 --> 16:10.390
Come on, honey.

16:10.390 --> 16:14.264
- Oh, your salami?
- Give myself a facial.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.725
My salami.

16:18.358 --> 16:21.811
A loofah.
Think I'll take a shower.

16:21.811 --> 16:25.815
I was feeling bad
about stealing Bennett
and Ellen's meat all day,

16:25.815 --> 16:27.527
but now that I see
what they're doing

16:27.527 --> 16:29.279
to those delightful
Wallaces,

16:29.279 --> 16:31.571
they kinda deserve it.

16:34.914 --> 16:37.577
I think we made
our point.

16:37.577 --> 16:39.329
Come on, Ellen.

16:43.002 --> 16:48.178
Well, I have solved the murder
of the ornamental dress.

16:48.178 --> 16:50.220
Actually, I solved it
two hours ago.

16:50.220 --> 16:52.182
Spent the last two hours
coming up with the line

16:52.182 --> 16:56.596
"murder of
the ornamental dress.

16:56.596 --> 16:58.978
Each of you
had a motive.

16:58.978 --> 17:02.352
So I was trying to figure out
which one of you did it.

17:02.352 --> 17:04.274
But then Chloe said

17:04.274 --> 17:05.775
she couldn't have
done it on her own,

17:05.775 --> 17:07.487
which made me realize,

17:07.487 --> 17:09.699
- none of you could have.
- [all sighing]

17:09.699 --> 17:11.911
- It was all of you.
- [all gasping]

17:14.414 --> 17:16.366
It all started with
a certain someone

17:16.366 --> 17:18.498
who loves playing
dress-up.

17:18.498 --> 17:21.121
I realized the weird smudges
came from the blue eye shadow

17:21.121 --> 17:22.832
Chloe had in her pocket.

17:22.832 --> 17:25.255
This is what Avery gets
for coming between

17:25.255 --> 17:27.217
a little girl
and her dress-up time.

17:27.217 --> 17:31.801
[evil laughter]

17:33.263 --> 17:35.435
But Tyler
hated the dress, too,

17:35.435 --> 17:38.228
so he decided he'd ruin it
more by washing it.

17:38.228 --> 17:40.850
This is what she gets
for not helping me

17:40.850 --> 17:42.602
fix my BMX uniform.

17:42.602 --> 17:45.645
And this is what I get
for washing reds with whites.

17:45.645 --> 17:47.687
An awesome pink shirt.

17:47.687 --> 17:50.780
[both laughing evilly]

17:50.780 --> 17:54.154
Then Karl sent Chloe off
to get my sketchbook.

17:54.154 --> 17:56.075
Why do you need
the sketchbook?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.578
It's from Frankenstein.
I'll explain later.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.290
Ow! My hair.

18:00.290 --> 18:03.583
Don't worry, it can't
possibly be of any consequence.

18:04.754 --> 18:06.756
Then he painted over it.

18:06.756 --> 18:10.130
This is what she gets
for not listening to
my life coaching.

18:10.130 --> 18:13.263
[all laughing evilly]

18:13.263 --> 18:15.765
Then you took it to Stan
so that he could do

18:15.765 --> 18:16.926
his dirty work.

18:16.926 --> 18:18.138
This is what she gets

18:18.138 --> 18:20.560
for not spending time
with my puppies.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.896
What? Do you expect me
to chew it with my teeth

18:26.896 --> 18:29.279
like some sort of animal?

18:30.860 --> 18:33.533
And now, we commit
this desecrated symbol

18:33.533 --> 18:36.075
of Avery's hubris
to the earth.

18:36.075 --> 18:38.908
Burying forever her pretense
to greatness

18:38.908 --> 18:42.372
with our blatant act
of depravity.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.123
Ditto.

18:45.915 --> 18:49.749
We must make a pact
to never speak of this again.

18:49.749 --> 18:52.882
[all laughing evilly]

18:54.754 --> 18:57.887
So are we getting ice cream
after this dark ritual?

18:59.889 --> 19:01.931
And that's how
you all did it.

19:01.931 --> 19:04.434
Who proved you all
were in cahoots?

19:04.434 --> 19:07.897
Avery. Pak-chika,
pak-chika, pak-chika.

19:11.070 --> 19:12.772
I think
we have to tell her.

19:12.772 --> 19:14.234
Very well.

19:14.234 --> 19:16.196
Avery, your song
is a derivative rip-off.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.078
I mean what happened
to the dress.

19:19.078 --> 19:21.080
I did play dress-up
with your dress,

19:21.080 --> 19:23.583
and those blue smudges
were makeup, but...

19:25.164 --> 19:26.786
Darn it, Avery.

19:26.786 --> 19:28.288
I didn't even want to try on
your dress

19:28.288 --> 19:29.589
till you told me
I couldn't.

19:29.589 --> 19:33.383
I feel so bad.
But I look so good.

19:35.134 --> 19:38.678
I'll just be super careful
taking off the dress.

19:44.264 --> 19:47.186
Oh, no.
I got makeup on it.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.230
Oh, man, Avery's gonna be
really upset if she sees this.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.191
But I can fix it.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.733
Hey, I can't make it worse.

19:53.733 --> 19:55.194
Well, I made it worse.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.868
[Tyler] So we took it to
the one person

19:58.868 --> 20:01.200
who we thought could
repaint your dress.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.952
Don't worry,
I fixed it.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.664
Using Avery's sketchbook
as a guide,

20:04.664 --> 20:06.205
along with the skill
I developed

20:06.205 --> 20:07.747
studying art at
the Sorbonne...

20:07.747 --> 20:09.128
online seminar.

20:12.001 --> 20:14.133
I thought you said
Karl was a good painter.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.676
Yeah, he did that great
painting of Mom and Dad.

20:16.676 --> 20:18.097
Oh, this?

20:21.180 --> 20:23.102
I love that painting.

20:24.604 --> 20:25.895
[Stan] When I saw what
they'd done,

20:25.895 --> 20:28.187
I knew they had
to come clean.

20:28.187 --> 20:31.150
Guys, we owe it to Avery
to take this to her,

20:31.150 --> 20:32.652
and tell her the truth.

20:35.064 --> 20:36.946
[fabric rips]

20:38.818 --> 20:40.660
Or we could bury it.

20:42.572 --> 20:45.455
We must make a pact
to never speak of this again.

20:45.455 --> 20:47.206
This would be
so much cooler

20:47.206 --> 20:49.078
if we were all
wearing black robes.

20:51.210 --> 20:53.172
We feel terrible about
what we did.

20:53.172 --> 20:54.374
We're really sorry, Avery.

20:54.374 --> 20:56.175
We totally blew it.

20:56.175 --> 20:58.298
I'm sorry, too.

20:58.298 --> 21:01.010
But I can't get that
"pak-chika, pak-chika"
out of my mind.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.262
It makes me wanna strut.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.264
Well, I guess I understand

21:05.264 --> 21:07.266
that none of you were
trying to hurt me.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.268
It was all just a mistake,
followed by a cover-up,

21:09.268 --> 21:12.692
and some horribly
stupid nonsense.

21:12.692 --> 21:15.525
It's how we do
in the 'dena.

21:18.658 --> 21:20.610
So I learned that when
you hurt your friends,

21:20.610 --> 21:22.241
you should own up to it.

21:22.241 --> 21:24.163
If only Robert
were still alive.

21:24.163 --> 21:26.205
Oh, Robert!

21:26.205 --> 21:28.207
You're back
on your feet!

21:28.207 --> 21:30.750
Oh, no, Robert,
you're a zombie.

21:32.752 --> 21:34.834
No, you cannot
eat my brains.

21:34.834 --> 21:36.676
No, you cannot.

21:36.676 --> 21:38.297
No, you cannot!

21:41.971 --> 21:45.094
Honey, I eventually realized
it wasn't you,

21:45.094 --> 21:47.927
and went back.

21:47.927 --> 21:51.230
The point is, we taught
those Wallaces a lesson.

21:53.272 --> 21:56.145
Bennett, the dogs
have all the meat.

21:56.145 --> 21:57.647
It wasn't the Wallaces.

21:57.647 --> 22:01.320
Stan must've followed us,
and then taken our food.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.743
You know what
we have to do.

22:03.743 --> 22:05.615
Apologize to the Wallaces?

22:05.615 --> 22:07.116
Or...

22:10.370 --> 22:13.753
We must make a pact to never
speak of this again.

22:13.753 --> 22:16.836
We really should be
wearing black robes for this.
