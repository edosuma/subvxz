LUCIOUS:
Previously on Empire...
So I don't have ALS.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.539
Myasthenia gravis.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.041
COOKIE:
Look, no matter
what, Tiana,

00:07.075 --> 00:08.676
you're family to us.

00:08.709 --> 00:11.812
Yo, you tryin' to make
some money up in here?

00:11.845 --> 00:12.913
Plead guilty.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.248
LUCIOUS:
I don't care how many of us

00:14.282 --> 00:15.383
you've locked behind bars.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.584
You ain't never
gonna be nothing

00:16.617 --> 00:18.419
but a black bitch
in cheap shoes.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.688
COOKIE: In partnership
with Mimi Whiteman,

00:20.721 --> 00:22.990
we have taken a controlling
interest in Empire.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.558
Sorry, brother,
it's just business.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.659
Yeah, it's just business.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.196
Right, Mimi?
Lucious Lyon is Empire.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.997
Without him,
the company is nothing.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.366
I'm gonna bury
your album, Hakeem.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.668
Get out of my father's house.
You betrayed him.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.371
Who do you think
you're talking to?

00:37.405 --> 00:39.039
You done now, lady.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.879
I gave my whole life
to this place.

00:45.913 --> 00:48.349
My album done...
now it's gone.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.450
Stop complainin'.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.419
We don't need this place.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.920
We can start our own company.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.022
I woke up this morning thinking

00:55.055 --> 00:57.125
why don't we do
what the hell I said?

00:57.158 --> 00:58.626
We gonna start
our own company.

00:58.659 --> 00:59.927
ANDRE:
It'll never work, Mom.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.028
The business has
changed completely

01:01.061 --> 01:02.029
since you and
Dad started out.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.697
This could work.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.099
We just need a dope name.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.800
We've got Hakeem.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.403
All he has to do is record
one more song for his album.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.139
Empire will never
let us have that album.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.406
You heard Jamal.
He's going to bury it.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.407
Let me deal with Jamal.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.542
All right, bye.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.544
Look, Mom, we need
to go after Royale T,

01:16.577 --> 01:18.379
Ratzo and Tiana.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.647
No, I already talked to Tiana.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.881
She's down with us.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.816
We just gotta get you
back into the studio.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.753
Okay, Mom, I'm so much more
than just a rapper.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.222
Let me develop my own artists.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.923
I bet Anika can get V.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.559
No! No.
Anika's out.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.227
I don't want to see
her lying face,

01:33.261 --> 01:34.562
you understand me, Keem?

01:34.595 --> 01:35.663
I told V we'd get
straight to work

01:35.696 --> 01:36.764
recording her
new single, so...

01:36.797 --> 01:38.299
Are you sure
Cookie wants me?

01:38.332 --> 01:39.967
Yeah, she definitely
wants you.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.235
Pride of the Lyons is wack.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.303
It's a terrible name.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.771
Did you tell Mom
you talked to Anika?

01:43.804 --> 01:45.806
Man, she don't want
nothing to do with her,

01:45.839 --> 01:48.108
Thank you.
but I told Anika
to come anyway.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.811
Nah, I like Pride
of the Lyons better.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.946
Look, we can call it
whatever you want, baby,

01:52.980 --> 01:54.582
as long as you in it with me.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.016
I think you should
reconsider Anika.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.585
She's one of the top
A&Rs in the business.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.921
I don't care how good she is,
I don't trust her ass.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.956
I just need you
with me on this, baby.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.325
I'm thinking about it, Ma.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.793
Just give me
a second to breathe.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.830
I actually think it could work.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.932
(phone line ringing)

02:11.965 --> 02:12.933
COOKIE: Hello?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.502
Hey, Ma, I want to start

02:14.535 --> 02:15.769
a girl group
like Destiny's Child.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.371
That's a great idea, Keem.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.640
Look, I think I got
a space for us to rent

02:19.673 --> 02:21.108
if Andre can
cut us a deal.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.109
Is Andre in?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.711
Well, he's gonna be.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.713
Look, just meet me at
Ghetto Ass Studio tomorrow.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.449
She's kidding, right?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.851
Forget Lyon's Den,
let's just call it The Pigsty.

02:30.884 --> 02:31.852
Man, we need a name
like Em...

02:31.885 --> 02:32.853
Forget the name, okay?

02:32.886 --> 02:34.355
The name is beside the point.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.690
You ain't born with your name.
You grow into it.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.627
Yeah, when we started Empire,
we wasn't no Empire.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.363
Making music
in Carol's living room

02:42.396 --> 02:44.532
until we graduated
to a garage

02:44.565 --> 02:46.867
that was way grimier
than this place.

02:46.900 --> 02:50.371
But see, it was those first few
songs that planted the seeds.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.173
Then I had to sit
on the sidelines

02:53.207 --> 02:54.842
and watch Lucious grow it

02:54.875 --> 02:57.044
into a multimillion-dollar
company

02:57.077 --> 03:00.848
worthy of a name like Empire.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.251
It's my time.
(chuckles)

03:03.284 --> 03:04.718
So whatever we call it,

03:04.752 --> 03:06.820
as long as Momma's got
something to do with it,

03:06.854 --> 03:08.822
it's gonna live up to its name.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.023
Let's go.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.099
MAN: You need what?

03:19.132 --> 03:20.234
I want to make a deal

03:20.268 --> 03:21.369
for using this space

03:21.402 --> 03:22.836
as our main base
of operations.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.238
That's crazy.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.239
You crazy.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.674
Oh, I know I'm crazy.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.841
Everybody knows
my mother's crazy.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.243
You're already in
one of our studios.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.911
Anika's recording with V.
What?!

03:30.944 --> 03:33.347
* The hourglass moves on

03:33.381 --> 03:34.915
* A grain

03:37.285 --> 03:40.354
* And our path is torn

03:40.388 --> 03:42.390
* And strained...

03:42.423 --> 03:43.891
Okay, wait.
Cut it right there.
Oh.

03:43.924 --> 03:44.892
V...

03:44.925 --> 03:47.528
You sound amazing.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.129
Um, there's just
one little thing

03:49.162 --> 03:51.131
that I think
I want to tweak.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.366
I feel like we might
need just to...

03:52.400 --> 03:53.534
I know what we need.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.035
'Cause I wrote it.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.604
Okay, look,

03:56.637 --> 03:57.805
I am on your side.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.039
All right?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.541
Now, I understand
that you're frustrated.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.542
I get it.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.577
You know what?

04:03.611 --> 04:05.479
I can't.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.381
V...

04:07.415 --> 04:08.549
V, wait, wait wait, wait.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.117
Beat it, boo boo kitty.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.619
I'm working with Veronica now.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.921
I don't even know
why you here.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.156
Okay, let's hear it
from the top.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.058
You know, this place remind me

04:18.091 --> 04:20.093
of the free clinic
back in Philly.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.496
We all right over there?

04:22.530 --> 04:24.164
Uh... no, actually.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.066
I don't have your
authorization form.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.135
What are you talking about?

04:28.168 --> 04:29.269
It was in your file

04:29.303 --> 04:30.604
when you got your meds,
a few days ago.

04:30.638 --> 04:31.772
Now it's not.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.607
Oh, come on, man,
I'm in here every week.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.942
I got myasthenia gravis.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.277
I sit down,
you demonstrate on my vein...

04:37.311 --> 04:38.979
I need my meds, pops.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.314
Mr. Lyon, I can't
dispense your meds

04:40.348 --> 04:41.315
without the
authorization form

04:41.349 --> 04:42.616
or I'm gonna get fired.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.418
You gonna get worse than fired
if you don't give me

04:44.452 --> 04:45.619
my meds right now.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.754
I need...
Come on, Mr. Lyon.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.821
Oh, come on...
Really? Really?

04:47.855 --> 04:48.922
Do I really gotta
push the button?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.424
Come on, I know
it ain't your fault.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.792
I know you gotta...
There's nothing I
can do about it.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.927
It's probably just
a filing mistake.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.195
If I were you...

04:55.228 --> 04:56.530
call your lawyer.
Right away.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.632
I'll get a C.O. to take
you back to your cell.

05:01.835 --> 05:05.973
* I was born to love you

05:06.006 --> 05:07.975
* And nobody else will do

05:08.008 --> 05:10.778
* I would rather die than live

05:10.811 --> 05:12.446
* Without you

05:12.480 --> 05:14.448
* And everybody know it too

05:14.482 --> 05:17.351
* Don't know why we go to war

05:17.385 --> 05:20.988
* But the one thing
that's for sure *

05:21.021 --> 05:24.558
* I was born to love you

05:24.592 --> 05:26.494
* And no one...

05:26.527 --> 05:29.630
* Born to love you,
born to love you *

05:29.663 --> 05:32.733
* Born to love you,
yeah, yeah yeah yeah *

05:32.766 --> 05:34.735
* I was born to love you
* Born to love you *

05:34.768 --> 05:36.003
* Born to love you *

05:36.036 --> 05:38.472
* Born to love you,
yeah-ah-ah-ah *

05:38.506 --> 05:41.308
* Born to love you *
* Born to love you

05:41.341 --> 05:42.710
* Born to love

05:42.743 --> 05:44.177
* Born to live

05:44.211 --> 05:46.980
* Born to die
if I lose your kiss *

05:47.014 --> 05:49.383
* Born to hold

05:49.417 --> 05:51.151
* Won't let go

05:51.184 --> 05:53.053
* Born to love you

05:53.086 --> 05:57.591
* So you'll always know.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.761
(applause)

06:03.363 --> 06:05.232
WOMAN:
Wow.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.669
That was amazing.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.237
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.005
Looking forward to
speaking to you.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.607
Oh, looking forward
to speaking to you, as well.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.509
I'm so happy you even
want to talk to me.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.510
Oh, of course.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.045
Thank you.
Who wouldn't?

06:18.078 --> 06:19.046
Okay.
MAN: Rolling!

06:19.079 --> 06:21.214
Jamal Lyon.
Yes.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.517
Wow, look at you!
(chuckles)

06:23.551 --> 06:25.252
Thank you for
that incredible song.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.855
Thank you.
And for
inviting us into

06:27.888 --> 06:29.189
your gorgeous home.
Of course.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.924
Any time. Yeah.
We're so lucky

06:30.958 --> 06:32.259
to have you here on
Spilling the Tea.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.094
As you can see from our P.A.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.363
over there, who has
a little crush on you,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.899
you have quite the female fans.

06:38.932 --> 06:39.967
Yeah, they're beautiful.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.935
I love them so much.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.303
How do you deal
with that?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.238
How do you feel,
having all of these women

06:45.272 --> 06:47.207
showering you
with attention

06:47.240 --> 06:49.209
and going crazy over you?
Men, as well,

06:49.242 --> 06:50.711
by the way.
(laughs)

06:50.744 --> 06:52.446
It's great.
I mean, we-we love,

06:52.480 --> 06:53.714
we love everybody.
It's beautiful.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.415
It must be tough
on relationships,

06:55.449 --> 06:56.950
though, right?
No, I don't think so.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.152
Um, if, uh,
if the relationship is solid.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.888
I don't...
It doesn't
cause jealousy?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.556
No, I don't... No.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.924
SHARON:
His name is Michael.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.093
He's a little shy,
but trust me, ladies,

07:06.126 --> 07:07.961
he is adorable.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.297
Plus, he cooked us
the most amazing meal

07:10.330 --> 07:12.466
while we were setting up.
But still,

07:12.500 --> 07:13.734
you know you're a lucky
guy, Michael, right?

07:13.767 --> 07:14.802
Yeah.
JAMAL:
Nah.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.003
No, no, I'm the lucky one.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.104
So, Jamal,

07:17.137 --> 07:19.106
can we expect a new album,

07:19.139 --> 07:21.408
a new Jamal Lyon album,
any time soon?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.143
You know we're all
waiting for it.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.479
Uh, I don't know about "soon."

07:25.513 --> 07:28.315
Uh... I am
creating music.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.817
You know, it's my everything,

07:29.850 --> 07:31.985
and, you know,
just been a little...

07:32.019 --> 07:33.153
I've been a little busy.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.154
You've been a little busy,

07:34.187 --> 07:35.623
haven't you?
A little busy, yeah.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.957
But while your father
is still awaiting trial...

07:36.990 --> 07:39.693
Mm-hmm?
Can you talk to
us about that?

07:39.727 --> 07:41.328
I know it must be
hard for you.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.764
Yeah. Uh, I can't say
too much about it,

07:43.797 --> 07:45.332
but, you know, I'm...

07:45.365 --> 07:47.167
just that I'm working
on my music,

07:47.200 --> 07:49.837
a-as always, and making sure

07:49.870 --> 07:51.839
that I continue to make smart

07:51.872 --> 07:53.974
business decisions,
you know.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.475
But, sure, what my dad
is going through,

07:55.509 --> 07:58.278
(elevator bell dings)
it's-it's hard.
It's hard on us all.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.479
Yes, and that's why it's gonna

07:59.513 --> 08:01.148
take all of us
to get through it.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.616
Uh, Jamal, I need
to talk to you.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.617
Wait, isn't this your...

08:03.651 --> 08:04.952
This is my mother.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.520
I'm sorry, you guys.
And his producer
and manager,

08:06.554 --> 08:08.055
until a couple
of hours ago.
(anxious laugh)

08:08.088 --> 08:09.657
Cookie Lyon.
We spoke on the phone, Sharon.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.858
Good to see you.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.560
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh. Yeah, Mom.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.361
Let's go. Come on.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.331
I am trying to do an interview,
in case you didn't notice.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.800
In case you have not noticed,

08:19.833 --> 08:21.301
I set up that interview.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.570
I have to get to the lawyer
after this,

08:22.603 --> 08:23.971
to try to get my father
out of jail,

08:24.004 --> 08:25.172
since you all bailed on him,

08:25.205 --> 08:26.807
so can we make this quick?
Please?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.376
Look, I need to talk
to you about Hakeem.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.544
Oh. Little baby traitor.

08:30.578 --> 08:33.513
He didn't do anything
to hurt you, Jamal.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.482
He was hurt. By Lucious.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.551
And I know you know
what that feels like.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.992
I need you to give Hakeem
his album back.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.027
Why would I do that?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.162
(sighs)

08:49.196 --> 08:50.397
Jamal, you already won.

08:50.430 --> 08:54.201
You run the Empire.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.236
All Hakeem's got is his music.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.008
I know you.

09:01.041 --> 09:05.112
See, Lucious is trying
to make you like him, but...

09:05.145 --> 09:07.180
you ain't him.
(chuckles)

09:07.214 --> 09:10.350
So come on in here,
walk me to these elevators.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.853
Show these cameras how good
you're being to your mom.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.287
It's Mom.
Can't say nothing to Mom.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.956
I'm sorry for
the interruption.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.691
Sharon, it was good
to see you, girl.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.359
Yeah. Sorry, Sharon.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.394
We just have some
business to finish up.
That's right. I'll be back.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.199
Oh, and, uh, Jamal...

09:26.233 --> 09:27.534
one last thing:

09:27.567 --> 09:29.436
I wanted to tell you first,

09:29.469 --> 09:31.304
before you hear it
out here in these streets.

09:31.338 --> 09:35.342
Me, Andre and Hakeem,
we're starting our own company.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.482
(men shouting, whooping)

09:42.515 --> 09:44.217
MAN: Come on, man, don't let him
by you like that!

09:44.251 --> 09:45.585
CLYDE:
You see this?

09:45.619 --> 09:46.887
Stayed in Iraq too long.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.321
First off all,
we ain't had no business

09:48.355 --> 09:49.556
over there in the first place.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.158
Their infrastructure
wasn't ready.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.559
GUY:
You guys paying attention

09:52.592 --> 09:53.927
to Professor Clyde here,

09:53.961 --> 09:57.230
showing off about how much
he reads the newspapers?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.066
That's what type of time we on.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.567
(men chuckle)

10:00.600 --> 10:03.403
Hey, Lucious, you finish writing
that verse yet or what?

10:03.436 --> 10:04.905
Damn skippy I did.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.640
Oh, man.

10:06.674 --> 10:07.941
Run that.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.277
Run that.
Man, I get paid to perform.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.980
Man, you get paid to shut
this whole place down.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.447
(laughing)

10:14.481 --> 10:15.448
All right.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.517
(clears throat)
Oh, yeah.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.486
Hit me with a beat.
I got it.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.488
* Temperatures in the hundreds

10:21.521 --> 10:23.156
* Hot as hell at this moment

10:23.190 --> 10:24.858
* Everything look suspicious

10:24.892 --> 10:26.326
* Coming around these corners

10:26.359 --> 10:29.296
* A man wanted, you can play
around if you want to *

10:29.329 --> 10:31.331
* Ain't no safety,
ain't no holster *

10:31.364 --> 10:33.033
* And my hands is on it

10:33.066 --> 10:35.769
* And I ain't going as easy
as you think I'm gon' go *

10:35.803 --> 10:38.005
* I'm-a lay low fo' a minute

10:38.038 --> 10:39.639
* Then I'm comin' for those

10:39.673 --> 10:41.541
* That decided
to cross the road *

10:41.574 --> 10:43.043
* And roll with
the wrong folks *

10:43.076 --> 10:44.611
* Like playing a grand piano

10:44.644 --> 10:46.513
* But tapping the wrong notes

10:46.546 --> 10:47.715
* Clyde told me

10:47.748 --> 10:49.182
* Keep your eyes
for them jealous hittas *

10:49.216 --> 10:50.784
* Clyde told me

10:50.818 --> 10:52.552
* Keep your head low
'cause they takin' pictures *

10:52.585 --> 10:53.987
* My partner Clyde told me

10:54.021 --> 10:55.889
* When they try to convince you
they chillin' with you *

10:55.923 --> 10:59.559
* Pay very close attention,
my hitta, my hitta, my hitta *

10:59.592 --> 11:00.961
* Snitch (coughs) bitch

11:00.994 --> 11:02.796
* Snitching-ass bitches

11:02.830 --> 11:05.232
* Snitch bitch,
snitching-ass... *
(Lucious coughing)

11:05.265 --> 11:07.300
LUCIOUS: Hey...
CLYDE:
You all right, bro?

11:07.334 --> 11:09.502
Hey, you good?

11:09.536 --> 11:11.071
(coughing)

11:11.104 --> 11:12.973
(heart beating rapidly)
(echoing):
Tell me what you need, bro.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.474
(echoing):
You need some water, man?

11:14.507 --> 11:15.475
(coughing continues)

11:15.508 --> 11:16.877
You cool, Lou?

11:16.910 --> 11:21.815
(coughing)

11:21.849 --> 11:24.051
You having a little
trouble breathing, inmate?

11:24.084 --> 11:26.820
Can't you see this man
need medical attention?

11:26.854 --> 11:28.588
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Give me a minute.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.656
All right, well,

11:29.689 --> 11:31.324
party's over.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.693
Now, get the hell
off my table, boys.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.695
We men.

11:35.729 --> 11:36.730
Excuse me?

11:36.764 --> 11:37.831
You called us "boys."

11:37.865 --> 11:39.166
Ain't no boys
over here; we men.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.268
Oh, come on, Clyde.
Don't mind him, man.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.103
We used to punk bitches
like that back in the day.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.171
Go on about your business.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.906
Did you just threaten me, boy?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.841
OFFICER: What?
(alarm whooping)

11:47.875 --> 11:49.943
Oh, come on, man!
What you gonna do?

11:49.977 --> 11:52.712
(alarm continues whooping)

11:52.746 --> 11:53.847
(alarm stops)
Get his ass out of here.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.682
Come on.
It's all right, Big Country.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.716
CLYDE: Aw, man,
ain't stressin' it.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.085
Be cool, man.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.552
Forget whose house this is.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.288
Mine!

12:01.321 --> 12:02.355
My table.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.224
My newspaper!

12:04.257 --> 12:05.692
That's my basketball goal.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.094
My everything!

12:07.127 --> 12:08.929
Don't you forget that.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.798
(coughs)

12:10.831 --> 12:13.200
Punk ass.

12:13.233 --> 12:17.037
(dance beat playing)

12:17.070 --> 12:20.373
WOMAN:
* If you're not down
for the game *

12:20.407 --> 12:22.309
* Then you're not down with me

12:22.342 --> 12:23.443
What's your name?
What's her name?

12:23.476 --> 12:24.978
Stacy.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.313
* It's about to get mean...

12:26.346 --> 12:27.614
Thank you, Stacy.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.116
* Ooh, dangerous...
Thank you, Stacy.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.751
Thank you.
Thank you.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.957
Valentina Galano?

12:36.990 --> 12:38.591
Galayna...?
Galindo.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.294
It's an old Spanish name meaning
"prophetic, philosophical

12:41.328 --> 12:43.096
and opinionated."
HAKEEM: Hey.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.898
We'll be the ones
with the opinions.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.800
Okay, Valentina, girl,
show me what you got.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.101
CHICKEN:
Okay, hit it.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.903
(dance beat starts playing)

12:49.937 --> 12:52.272
* Hit me up like every night

12:52.305 --> 12:54.641
* Say you want to have
a pillow fight *

12:54.674 --> 12:56.643
* But you're holding back
and I don't know why *

12:56.676 --> 12:58.912
* Baby, can I just be real?

12:58.946 --> 13:02.249
* Getting hot
when I'm all alone *

13:02.282 --> 13:04.317
* Every time your name
drops on my phone *

13:04.351 --> 13:05.752
* But a picture
just ain't enough *

13:05.785 --> 13:07.988
* Need a little something
to feel *

13:08.021 --> 13:09.089
* Yeah

13:09.122 --> 13:11.424
* All we do is talk about it

13:11.458 --> 13:13.493
* But can't we just
be about it? *

13:13.526 --> 13:15.762
* Show me what you gonna
do about it. *

13:15.795 --> 13:17.597
(chuckles)

13:17.630 --> 13:18.999
Damn, you ain't
playing no games.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.934
So, do I have the job?

13:20.968 --> 13:22.936
I'm trying to keep it at three,

13:22.970 --> 13:24.637
but we got three girls
we like, you know?

13:24.671 --> 13:25.638
You definitely a contender.

13:25.672 --> 13:26.840
What do you mean "three"?

13:26.874 --> 13:27.975
Three girl group.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.609
On Instagram,
it didn't say anything

13:29.642 --> 13:30.844
about a girl group.

13:30.878 --> 13:31.945
Yeah, it did.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.780
You just missed
the fine print.

13:33.813 --> 13:37.284
Whatever. I'm not interested
in being a part of a group.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.119
Thank you.
We gave you a shot.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.154
(speaking Spanish)

13:44.657 --> 13:46.526
Let me just translate a bitch.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.028
With or without you,

13:48.061 --> 13:50.030
I shine.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.365
She crazy.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.800
I love her.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.168
CHICKEN: You sure you
want to do this?

13:55.202 --> 13:56.236
Three girls together?

13:56.269 --> 13:59.306
It's gonna be that...
all the time.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.740
* Don't keep me waiting

14:00.773 --> 14:01.909
* I've been here all night

14:01.942 --> 14:03.476
Hakeem...

14:03.510 --> 14:06.379
* Stop hesitating...
Hakeem... Please.
Please. Thank you.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.814
What is this mess, man?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.049
It's auditions, bro--
when you want to be a mogul.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.483
Keep going, babe.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.152
* You're not that typical...

14:12.185 --> 14:14.054
Don't you sing another word.
Don't sing another word.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.189
You can't go off

14:16.223 --> 14:17.657
and make moves like this
without checking in

14:17.690 --> 14:19.026
with the rest of us--
you know that.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.493
I don't need permission.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.661
We're partners.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.197
CHICKEN:
Isabel, keep going.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.566
HAKEEM:
Come on, you ready?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.335
* I picked you out
of the candy shop *

14:28.368 --> 14:30.203
* One look and you made
my heart go pop pop... *

14:30.237 --> 14:31.671
Why you letting Hakeem
launch a girl group?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.540
Excuse me. Don't knock
your brother's hustle.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.342
No, Hakeem needs to be
recording new music.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.910
Not wasting his time
hitting on girls.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.946
That's how Jay-Z and your
father built their careers.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.414
Besides, he gots a whole
album ready to drop.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.849
On Empire, Mom.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.919
I spoke to Jamal and I asked him
to give it back to Hakeem.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.021
Did he say yes?
Not yet.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.756
Hakeem needs
to be recording new music

14:49.789 --> 14:52.225
or the ship is gonna sink
before it even leaves the port.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.261
(sighs)

14:59.166 --> 15:00.533
(whooping)

15:00.567 --> 15:02.602
Look, baby, if you trying
to get your demo heard,

15:02.635 --> 15:04.704
this ain't how you go about it.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.873
Contrary to the little
pack of lap dogs you got

15:06.906 --> 15:09.209
following you around up in
here, you see not everybody's

15:09.242 --> 15:11.211
interested in being
up your ass, Lyon.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.213
Then tell me
what your interests are,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.914
McKnight.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.549
(imitating raspy voice):
My interest is that

15:16.583 --> 15:17.917
your wheezing and your breath--

15:17.951 --> 15:19.886
(normal voice): I'm a little
concerned about that.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.721
Is it, is it getting any better?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.390
(raspy):
Oh, it's fine.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.924
I'm touched that y'all care.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.227
(chuckles)
We don't care.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.462
Matter of fact,
we-we could give a damn.

15:29.496 --> 15:33.333
You see, I think you
make us all look bad.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.568
As far as I'm concerned,

15:35.602 --> 15:38.105
the world would be a better
place without you in it.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.740
But the Federal Prosecutor,

15:40.773 --> 15:43.110
Ms. Roxanne Ford...

15:43.143 --> 15:45.412
she's more forgiving than me.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.981
And that medication of yours--

15:48.015 --> 15:49.916
it might just magically

15:49.949 --> 15:52.619
turn up if you just be
a little more cooperative.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.955
Think about that.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.804
So, Tiana's in the big studio
tomorrow, working on a new song.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.474
It'll be our first shot
at releasing a single.

16:14.507 --> 16:18.045
HAKEEM:
Can I just worry about
my girl group, please?

16:18.078 --> 16:20.647
You mean your personal
speed dating service?

16:20.680 --> 16:21.981
Look, I haven't
found my Beyoncé yet,

16:22.015 --> 16:24.351
but I found a couple girls
that's really good.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.553
You know,
but they're both Hispanic.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.488
Ain't nothing wrong
with a couple of J-Lo's

16:28.521 --> 16:30.290
as long as they
can really sing.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.691
Well, damn.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.195
What is she doing here?

16:35.228 --> 16:37.297
What-what are you doing here?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.298
We need to talk about Vee.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.233
We don't need
to talk about nothing.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.668
You need to get out.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.503
Why do you keep coming around?
ANDRE: Mom, Mom...

16:43.536 --> 16:45.004
Don't nobody want you here,
Anika!
Enough, enough!

16:45.038 --> 16:47.006
Hakeem,

16:47.040 --> 16:48.641
what's the problem
with the two Latinas?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.143
Uh, look,
I thought it'd be cool--

16:50.177 --> 16:51.911
we had one white girl,
you know,

16:51.944 --> 16:53.313
one black girl and one Hispanic.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.215
I'm-a call 'em
Rainbow Sensation.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.018
Boom-- platinum album.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.388
That's the dumbest name
I ever heard.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.823
Actually, that may be
the dumbest name known to man.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.325
Did your daddy
drop you on your head?

17:05.358 --> 17:06.493
Anika liked it.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.661
The concept, not the name.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.896
It's a marketable
concept.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.164
Yeah... (chuckles)

17:11.198 --> 17:12.732
And Anika knows marketing.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.668
She made a whole career
selling her ass.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.903
Oh, as opposed to you

17:16.936 --> 17:18.671
and your stellar career
in pharmaceuticals?

17:18.705 --> 17:21.441
Let me tell you something, ho.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.510
If it weren't for women like me,

17:23.543 --> 17:27.013
bitches like you would spend
a lifetime on their knees.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.750
Or underneath
my 20-year-old son.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.352
Mom, it's none of your business
who I get dirty with.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.187
Good luck.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.022
Hey, you need
the luck, girl.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.624
I don't understand
what part of

17:37.657 --> 17:39.726
"don't want you here"
you don't get.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.533
There you go.
All right, good.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.700
Thank you, brother.
Appreciate it.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.937
I thinking about, uh,
giving Hakeem back his album.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.972
With our stock plummeting.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.875
What kind of message that gonna
send to the shareholders?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.310
That we're completely
unthreatened by Cookie Lyon

17:57.344 --> 17:59.212
and her little startup.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.947
What are they calling it?

18:00.980 --> 18:02.249
It ain't got a name yet.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.584
'Cause they plan on
piggybacking off of mine.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.720
Hakeem belongs at Empire.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.056
If he wants his album heard,

18:10.089 --> 18:11.891
he gonna have to come
back to the Empire.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.360
You got to make that happen.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.297
All right.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.068
(grunts)

18:22.101 --> 18:23.903
Dad, what's the matter?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.238
What's wrong with you?

18:25.272 --> 18:26.339
Nothing.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.408
Fine.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.909
In fact, I'm better
than fine, man.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.413
I got this new melody
that's... my own.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.915
I made my own heat.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.150
Yeah?

18:37.184 --> 18:38.451
I'm actually
thinking about doing

18:38.485 --> 18:40.620
a Lucious Lyon joint
from the joint.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.789
(both laughing)

18:42.822 --> 18:44.424
While I'm still in here.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.159
Be so dope, Dad.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.594
That gonna be epic.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.996
Beautiful.
Hey, son.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.764
How you gonna
do that up in here?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.333
Just get me, um,

18:53.366 --> 18:56.269
some basic recording
equipment: a laptop...

18:56.303 --> 18:59.272
and, uh,
they got a new thing--

18:59.306 --> 19:01.208
a mini twister.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.844
And they got a Step Up, too.
Get me a Step Up, too.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.379
MAN: (clears throat)
Excuse me.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.447
Couldn't help overhearing.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.282
My name is Thurston Rawlings.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.850
Friends call me Thirsty.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.285
I think I could be
of some service.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.354
Purple suit,
no cross talk!

19:14.387 --> 19:15.955
Okay.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.490
Oh, you're a lawyer, huh?

19:17.524 --> 19:19.459
We got a lawyer, man.
Thank you.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.194
I don't doubt that,
but if you don't mind me asking,

19:21.228 --> 19:23.630
when's the last time
they got you a bail hearing?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.833
And where did you go to
law school, Mr., uh, Rawlings?

19:26.866 --> 19:28.034
University of Guam.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.669
Now, I know it's not
Harvard, but...

19:29.702 --> 19:31.871
same curriculum,
different campus.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.306
You're preaching
to the choir, man.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.708
Harvard ain't done
nothing for me these days.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.645
You think you can
do better, Thirsty?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.012
JAMAL: Wait...
I wouldn't waste
your time, Mr. Lyons.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.314
Hey, you, you're
out of bounds!

19:41.348 --> 19:42.615
I'm sorry, man,
hold on one second.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.720
I ain't trying to knock
nobody's hustle, but...

19:47.754 --> 19:51.491
University of Guam with
the... the discount suit?

19:51.524 --> 19:52.892
THIRSTY:
Really?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.327
No disrespect, son,
but I don't think

19:54.361 --> 19:56.162
Ms. Roxanne Ford
gives a damn where I shop.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.530
Do you?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.168
What do you know about her?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.670
Withholding your meds?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.004
That's one of her stunts.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.073
She's trying to get you
to cop a guilty plea.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.542
Mama plays dirty,
but I got no qualms

20:09.576 --> 20:10.777
getting in the mud
with her.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.844
Discount suit and all.

20:11.878 --> 20:12.845
OFFICER:
All right, let's go.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.013
Yes, I am ready
to go, Officer.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.147
Thank you very much.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.855
Set up a meeting.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.090
CHICKEN:
And five, six,

20:24.123 --> 20:25.525
seven, eight...

20:25.558 --> 20:28.094
(dreamy dance beat playing)

20:28.127 --> 20:30.730
Yeah, groove it out,
groove it out!

20:33.300 --> 20:34.401
Hit this beat.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.868
(steel drum beat begins)

20:35.902 --> 20:37.203
* How many girls in the world

20:37.236 --> 20:38.538
* Right now

20:38.571 --> 20:39.906
* Who know
what I'm talking 'bout *

20:39.939 --> 20:41.073
A little bit more attitude.
Come on, ladies!

20:41.107 --> 20:43.075
* A man who calls you
pretty at home *

20:43.109 --> 20:46.279
* But never
when he takes you out *

20:46.313 --> 20:48.047
* Didn't want it when
you had it, admit it *

20:48.080 --> 20:50.717
* And now you're like a light,
turned on *

20:50.750 --> 20:52.552
Come on, Ti.
* Didn't want me
when you had it *

20:52.585 --> 20:54.621
* I get it and now
you want me back *

20:54.654 --> 20:56.389
* But I'm gone

20:56.423 --> 20:57.924
* And I'm on fire

20:57.957 --> 20:59.892
* I'm like a spark
in the dark sky *

20:59.926 --> 21:03.062
* You're like a deer
caught in headlights *

21:03.095 --> 21:05.765
* You got me wrong,
but it's all right *

21:05.798 --> 21:07.634
* Now I'm like ooh, ooh

21:07.667 --> 21:10.403
* See me up in the club
like woo-ooh *

21:10.437 --> 21:12.905
* Don't matter,
I ain't worried about you-ooh *

21:12.939 --> 21:14.807
* 'Cause I left
that girl behind *

21:14.841 --> 21:16.142
I want to see you
dig on this one.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.311
* So let me introduce you
Come on, lower!

21:18.345 --> 21:21.448
* To the new and improved
brand-new, ooh *

21:21.481 --> 21:23.616
* You didn't want it when
you had it, that's coo-ool *

21:23.650 --> 21:25.117
Real low!
* Now I've gone from the one

21:25.151 --> 21:27.787
* To the two-- two point oh.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.490
(chuckles)

21:30.523 --> 21:32.459
Take five.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.527
Okay, okay.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.828
You on fire, Mama.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.964
I want to know where
you learned that from.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.265
Do you got that song
that you owe me?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.467
Nah, not yet.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.435
You know, I'm a little
hectic right now, but...

21:42.469 --> 21:43.936
Mm, I get it.

21:43.970 --> 21:44.937
I know how it goes.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.439
You trying to be
Diddy and all.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.274
Ti, you know, that's what
I want to talk to you about.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.442
What's up?

21:49.476 --> 21:51.778
My girl group.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.279
Oh, you want me to like...

21:53.312 --> 21:54.947
rehearse with them and
coach them and stuff?

21:54.981 --> 21:56.282
I want you to join them.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.317
You're kidding, right?
Listen, Ti.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.786
This could be big for you.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.287
And I'm talking about you being

22:01.320 --> 22:02.622
in the forefront
of the whole situation.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.957
But I'm already in the
front of my own situation.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.460
And if this is what this
company is gonna be
about, then, like...

22:07.494 --> 22:09.396
Hey, hey, hey.
What happened?

22:09.429 --> 22:11.297
Nothing, I just offered
an opportunity to be a part

22:11.330 --> 22:12.965
of a groundbreaking
musical phenomenon.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.367
Cookie, if this is
what this company

22:14.401 --> 22:15.802
is gonna be about,
I'm out.

22:15.835 --> 22:19.338
Uh, Tiana, look, um, Hakeem is
just a little overexcited.

22:19.372 --> 22:22.375
Come to my office, I want
to talk to you about something.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.552
(tires screech)

22:34.186 --> 22:35.254
Get in.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.995
What's up, boss man?

22:43.029 --> 22:44.664
I ain't your boss man.

22:44.697 --> 22:48.935
I saw Dad today, and he wants
you back at Empire.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.504
So do I.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.839
Why now?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.874
'Cause we're family.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.845
And it's time to move
past what y'all did.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.848
So that mean you'll bring
Cookie and Andre back too.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.750
That's what you're saying?

23:03.783 --> 23:05.885
Let's take it one step
at a time, all right?

23:07.820 --> 23:11.458
Hakeem, you got a huge
career ahead of you.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.526
Come back to Empire,
we'll release your album,

23:13.560 --> 23:15.562
give it a huge push,
the whole thing.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.932
Come on, fool, don't
be crazy, you know it.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.471
(door opens)

23:24.504 --> 23:27.239
(door closes)

23:36.415 --> 23:37.750
Let's go.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.389
Adios amigos...

23:43.422 --> 23:45.057
(speaks garbled Spanish)
VALENTINA: What?

23:45.091 --> 23:46.759
You got to teach me Spanish.
Mm-hmm.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.095
I studied my ass
off in 12th grade,

23:49.128 --> 23:51.297
and I still flunked español.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.600
Come here.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.502
* Hating on the sideline,
debt that *

23:55.535 --> 23:58.337
* She know exactly where
she can find the best at *

23:58.370 --> 24:00.907
* I'm leaning, two-seater,
we rolling *

24:00.940 --> 24:02.909
* We speeding, stick shift,
she holding... *

24:02.942 --> 24:05.578
So you're really not doing
your little girl group?

24:05.612 --> 24:07.279
I'm thinking about going
back to Empire.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.949
See, if that girl group
was a part of Empire,

24:09.982 --> 24:11.951
then I would definitely
be a part of it.

24:11.984 --> 24:16.623
Empire is hip-hop
legendary.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.291
I'm trying to be a
legend, aren't you?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.162
What can I get for you,
pretty lady?

24:24.564 --> 24:27.433
Nothing, thanks.
(clears throat)

24:27.466 --> 24:30.102
I haven't really been
drinking too much lately.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.038
Oh, well...

24:32.071 --> 24:34.774
I am drinking
much more than usual.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.108
(both chuckle)

24:36.142 --> 24:37.476
What's up?

24:40.146 --> 24:42.782
Um...

24:42.815 --> 24:44.116
God, I'm so nervous.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.818
I...
Why?

24:48.320 --> 24:51.958
Well... I'm not
supposed to be here,

24:51.991 --> 24:55.294
so if I could talk
to you in confidence.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.630
Andre would kill me if
he knew I were here.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.900
I'm not gonna say
anything, I swear.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.235
I'm scared for him, Jamal.

25:03.269 --> 25:06.238
He's miserable.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.307
Empire is everything to him,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.977
and, without it,
he's completely lost.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.511
Yeah, well, then why is
he doing the whole thing

25:12.545 --> 25:13.980
with my mom and Hakeem
like that?
I know, I know.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.314
But that's not him.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.849
That's not who he is.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.486
Look, Andre messed up.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.154
Obviously. He knows that.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.157
But I'm asking you,
as his brother,

25:25.191 --> 25:27.827
to find it in your heart
to forgive him.

25:27.860 --> 25:32.164
Because all he wants is
to be back at Empire

25:32.198 --> 25:34.166
with you and Lucious

25:34.200 --> 25:39.038
at the company that he gave
his entire life and heart to.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.978
I miss him, too,
Rhonda, I do.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.950
There's just so much stuff
that I'm handling now.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.052
Trust me,
I'd give anything

25:53.085 --> 25:55.655
to be able to just
hand that off to Andre.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.693
(anxious laugh)

26:00.727 --> 26:04.063
The reason I'm not drinking
is because I'm pregnant.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.400
We're having a baby.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.570
Are you serious?

26:11.604 --> 26:14.741
Yes, I'm serious.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.743
I mean, obviously I'm-a
talk to Lucious now.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.144
Really? Really?
Of course.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.479
Uncle Jamal.
Uncle Jamal.

26:20.512 --> 26:23.382
What they know
about Uncle Jamal?
(laughing):
Sounds good, man.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.217
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.886
Thank you.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.889
And obviously, you know,
don't say anything.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.892
Uh-uh.
Andre would never
forgive me, really, so...

26:32.925 --> 26:34.226
But I'm gonna handle it.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.227
Thank you.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.395
I'm so happy for y'all.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.764
Thank you.
That's so amazing.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.269
(lock buzzing)

26:46.773 --> 26:48.107
Lyon.

26:54.346 --> 26:55.581
A little something
from your lawyer...

26:55.614 --> 26:57.616
Thirsty Rawlings.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.620
My lawyer?

27:06.458 --> 27:09.095
OFFICER:
Make a left.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.097
Last door.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.766
I know I bust you up
the other day.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.768
I had to do that.

27:15.802 --> 27:19.772
You should know Thirsty got
a lot of friends in here.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.473
Open it up.

27:27.513 --> 27:30.216
Oh! You ready
to smash this, brother?

27:30.249 --> 27:31.550
(Guy laughs)

27:31.583 --> 27:34.453
Afterburners, baby...
afterburners.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.555
LUCIOUS:
How much time we got?

27:36.588 --> 27:37.790
You got 65 minutes
before the shift change.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.025
I'm locking you in,

27:39.058 --> 27:40.793
so nobody can get on you
for being out of bounds,

27:40.827 --> 27:42.795
but you got to work fast.
Thank you, bro.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.230
This is what I got--
check it out.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.966
(siren wails, music begins)

27:46.999 --> 27:48.000
Ooh, I like
the police car.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.971
I love what you did
with the hums.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.974
Open up a track for me.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.142
(whoops)

27:56.175 --> 27:57.643
* Sitting back
* Uh-huh *

27:57.676 --> 27:59.345
* Reminiscing

27:59.378 --> 28:01.347
* Of how I used to get down
and dirty wit cha *

28:01.380 --> 28:02.648
* Come on *

28:02.681 --> 28:04.516
* Pull up on a hot block
to come and get you *

28:04.550 --> 28:05.517
* Yeah! *

28:05.551 --> 28:06.853
* Wit a pistol cocked

28:06.886 --> 28:08.721
* To handle all issues
* Whoo! *

28:08.755 --> 28:10.656
* But never would I thought
in a million wishes *

28:10.689 --> 28:12.091
* Man! *

28:12.124 --> 28:14.093
* After all we stood for,
you would start snitching *

28:14.126 --> 28:15.427
* What? *

28:15.461 --> 28:17.396
* I disregarded lessons
that were shared with me *

28:17.429 --> 28:18.765
* Go on *

28:18.798 --> 28:20.199
* 'Cause I was taught
I'm not supposed to trust any *

28:20.232 --> 28:21.700
* Ah! *

28:21.734 --> 28:24.670
* It's hard to see the frame
when you in the picture *

28:24.703 --> 28:27.406
* But now the picture's faded,
bitch, I'm done wit cha *

28:27.439 --> 28:28.741
* Hey! *

28:28.775 --> 28:30.276
* So go on 'head
* Go on 'head *

28:30.309 --> 28:31.510
* Handle your business
* Handle your business *

28:31.543 --> 28:32.912
* And get right
* Uh-huh *

28:32.945 --> 28:34.546
* 'Cause I'm coming to get cha
* At ya! *

28:34.580 --> 28:37.383
* Streets are watching,
eyes are on me *

28:37.416 --> 28:40.519
* Closest to me done
switched up on me *

28:40.552 --> 28:43.890
* Days are long
and nights are lonely *

28:43.923 --> 28:47.293
* It's better to know it
'cause now I know it and... *

28:47.326 --> 28:48.694
* You ain't nothing
but a snitch, bitch *

28:48.727 --> 28:50.396
* Snitching ass bitch

28:50.429 --> 28:51.898
* Snitch, bitch
* And you are *

28:51.931 --> 28:53.866
* Snitching ass bitch,
and you know it *

28:53.900 --> 28:55.734
* And you know it,
and you know it *

28:55.768 --> 28:57.236
* And you know it,
and I know it *

28:57.269 --> 28:58.905
* And I know it,
and you know I know it *

28:58.938 --> 29:00.239
* You know I know it

29:00.272 --> 29:01.573
* Temperatures in the hundreds

29:01.607 --> 29:03.242
* Hot as hell at this moment

29:03.275 --> 29:06.245
* Everything looks suspicious
coming around these corners *

29:06.278 --> 29:07.579
* A man wanted
* You know it *

29:07.613 --> 29:09.315
* You can play around
if you want to *

29:09.348 --> 29:11.283
* Ain't no safety,
ain't no holster *

29:11.317 --> 29:13.285
* And my hands is on it

29:13.319 --> 29:15.888
* Now I ain't going as easy
as you think I'm gon' go *

29:15.922 --> 29:17.723
* I'm-a lay low for a minute

29:17.756 --> 29:19.391
* Then I'm coming for those

29:19.425 --> 29:22.461
* That decided to cross the road
and roll with the wrong folks *

29:22.494 --> 29:25.998
* Right *
* Like playing a grand piano
but tapping the wrong notes *

29:26.032 --> 29:27.333
* Whoo! *
* Clyde told me

29:27.366 --> 29:29.268
* Keep your eyes open
for them jealous hittas *

29:29.301 --> 29:30.569
* Clyde told me

29:30.602 --> 29:31.570
* Keep your head low

29:31.603 --> 29:33.005
* 'Cause they taking pictures

29:33.039 --> 29:34.406
* My partner Clyde told me

29:34.440 --> 29:36.075
* When they try to convince you
they chillin' with you *

29:36.108 --> 29:37.343
* Pay very close attention

29:37.376 --> 29:38.978

29:39.011 --> 29:42.348
* 'Cause you snitch, bitch,

29:42.381 --> 29:44.016
* Snitch, bitch

29:44.050 --> 29:45.251
* Snitching ass bitch

29:45.284 --> 29:46.919
* And you know it,
and you know it... *

29:46.953 --> 29:48.454
* And you know it,

30:05.571 --> 30:09.341

(humming melody)

30:11.911 --> 30:16.715
(music track fades,
as singers hum melody solo)

30:18.317 --> 30:20.052
That's a great session, man.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.288
That's a Lucious Lyon hit
right there.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.723
I wish Clyde was here.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.625
Good thing I got to work early

30:26.658 --> 30:28.627
or you degenerates might have
got away with this trash.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.163
Come on, man, we just trying
to make a little music.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.798
You out of bounds, inmate.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.500
With contraband!

30:34.533 --> 30:35.834
Lock 'em up!

30:35.868 --> 30:36.835
All of 'em!

30:36.869 --> 30:38.837
We already locked up, brother.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.173
I'm not your brother, inmate.

30:47.779 --> 30:50.416
We was just talking
about your ass.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.084
Is that right?

30:52.118 --> 30:53.452
Talk about it in the hole.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.094
McKNIGHT: How does it feel
to be in there now, huh?

31:02.128 --> 31:04.196
You rap like you
some sort of tough guy.

31:04.230 --> 31:07.199
But in here, you just
another prisoner.

31:07.233 --> 31:10.169
Matter of fact,
I could kill you right now.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.172
Wouldn't be no consequences.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.841
Just another dead rapper.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.509
You sure about
that, baby blue?

31:17.543 --> 31:18.677
Oh, I'm sure.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.679
'Cause, see, I'm all
about the consequences.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.615
I got consequences from
uptown to downtown,

31:23.649 --> 31:25.617
from the five boroughs
to the seven continents,

31:25.651 --> 31:27.619
that know each and every
person in this world

31:27.653 --> 31:28.620
that you care about.

31:28.654 --> 31:29.721
You threatening me, inmate?

31:29.755 --> 31:31.390
Nah, no threats.

31:31.423 --> 31:32.691
Just stating the obvious.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.694
'Cause that's not a violation.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.229
That's a new charge.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.897
You gonna get hit
with more years

31:38.931 --> 31:42.201
than all your gold
and platinum records combined.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.535
Nah, that's where
you're mistaken,

31:43.569 --> 31:44.870
'cause I'm not
getting convicted.

31:44.903 --> 31:45.871
You know why?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.539
Let me guess.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.874
'Cause you innocent, right?

31:48.907 --> 31:50.542
No-- since when
does that matter?

31:50.576 --> 31:52.211
I'm not getting convicted

31:52.244 --> 31:54.546
because people like you
and that bitch Miss Ford,

31:54.580 --> 31:55.948
y'all make mistakes.

31:55.982 --> 31:56.983
I don't.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.633
(tires screeching)

32:20.306 --> 32:21.407
(grunting)
(blows smacking)

32:21.440 --> 32:24.076
Where is it?

32:24.110 --> 32:25.277
Don't know
what you talking about.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.046
The music, scumbag.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.929
You sure everything
is on there?

32:43.962 --> 32:47.299
Yeah, I double-checked
before we cracked his ribs.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.804
All right, you two
take a dance class.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.173
Yes, sir.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.978
Uh, what is it that you wanted
to talk to me about, Andre?

33:00.012 --> 33:01.647
HAKEEM: Hey, Ma,
I need to talk to you.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.216
Save it, baby.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.885
I already know your father
and your brother Jamal

33:06.918 --> 33:08.687
are trying to get you
back to Empire,

33:08.720 --> 33:11.457
and I guess I got to understand.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.160
So you saying you want me
to go back to Empire?

33:14.193 --> 33:17.029
No, it's breaking my heart,
but I can't stop you.

33:17.063 --> 33:19.131
Taking your Rainbow Abomination
with you?

33:19.165 --> 33:20.666
Rainbow Sensation
ain't happening.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.301
I found three
chicks I like,

33:22.334 --> 33:24.303
but they all Latina and feisty.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.637
You are aware

33:25.671 --> 33:27.173
that the English-speaking
Latino market

33:27.206 --> 33:29.141
is the fastest-growing,
largest, untapped market

33:29.175 --> 33:30.542
in the country, right?

33:30.576 --> 33:32.244
An all-Latina girl group,
that could be huge, man.

33:32.278 --> 33:33.479
Really?
Yep.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.214
So we may have
something here,

33:35.247 --> 33:37.816
if I can get Valentina
on our team instead of Empire.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.818
I thought you were going back?

33:39.851 --> 33:41.687
I'm not going back to Empire.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.190
I'm not working for
Dad or Jamal punk-ass.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.525
I'm gonna be hip-hop legendary
in my own right.

33:46.558 --> 33:47.826
So you giving up
on your album?

33:47.859 --> 33:49.661
Did I say that?

33:49.695 --> 33:50.829
Check this out.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.331
Chicken, do it.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.566
Your boy is going
for the crown.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.867
My album,

33:55.901 --> 33:57.203
the one Empire

33:57.236 --> 33:59.037
wasn't gonna drop,

33:59.071 --> 34:00.539
I just leaked it online.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.174
Are you crazy?
Isn't that illegal?

34:02.208 --> 34:03.542
I don't know and I don't care.

34:03.575 --> 34:04.810
You don't know
and you don't care?

34:05.611 --> 34:07.579
Are you stupid?
Are you?

34:08.714 --> 34:11.016
Empire is gonna sue
the hell out of you.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.684
Uh...
And they'd be right to.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.019
I don't care
if they sue us.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.554
I don't care if
I lose money from it.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.923
All I care about is that my
music is out to the world

34:17.956 --> 34:19.091
and that it's gonna
be legendary.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.492
CHICKEN:
You right.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.861
That's it.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.696
I'm done.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.031
Andre!

34:26.064 --> 34:28.667
I don't care.
Andre!

34:29.735 --> 34:32.037
Andre!

34:32.070 --> 34:33.239
Andre...

34:33.272 --> 34:34.773
Andre!

34:36.508 --> 34:38.043
You worry too much.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.612
There is no way Jamal gonna sue
his own brother.

34:40.646 --> 34:43.349
No, no, you don't
worry enough, Cookie.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.818
I'm sorry, Mom.

34:46.852 --> 34:50.556
Okay, it's not you, it's not,
it's not even Hakeem.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.890
This isn't me.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.592
This is a scrappy
little setup.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.427
It's not what I've been
working for all these years.

34:55.461 --> 34:56.762
It's not what I want.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.765
My heart is not in this, Mom.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.801
Please...

35:02.834 --> 35:05.137
I need you to let me go.

35:05.171 --> 35:07.072
Let me go, Mom.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.674
No.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.075
Mom...
Andre, please.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.577
I need you...
I need you.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.644
Let me go, Mom.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.780
Andre...
Let me go.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.815
Let me go.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.622
(sniffles)

35:30.996 --> 35:32.931
This room is full of Torahs.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.966
I copped the building
from the Vizhnitz Dynasty.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.268
The Fishnets who?

35:36.302 --> 35:38.670
It's a Jewish thing,
a Hasidic dynasty.

35:38.704 --> 35:39.938
You see them all over
this neighborhood,

35:39.971 --> 35:41.440
the crazy dudes
with the curlicues

35:41.473 --> 35:42.608
and the big black hats.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.776
Dynasty, hmm.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.813
That's a dope name.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.781
So are you saying this
space is available?

35:49.815 --> 35:51.450
The whole floor?

35:51.483 --> 35:53.952
Might be, if it means
getting you out of my face.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.988
(chuckles)

35:57.022 --> 35:58.724
Yeah, this could work.

35:58.757 --> 36:01.793
As soon as you clean
this place up, of course.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.230
Actually, since you'll be
the one renting it,

36:04.263 --> 36:06.265
that'll be your ass
doing the cleaning.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.168
(giggles)

36:10.202 --> 36:12.371
Mazel tov.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.977
(lock buzzes in distance)

36:19.010 --> 36:21.213
I hear you want
to come back to Empire.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.217
I never should've been a part
of that hostile takeover.

36:25.251 --> 36:28.320
I messed up big-time,
Pop, and I know it.

36:28.354 --> 36:32.057
Hurt me to my core to watch you
take sides against me, son.

36:34.393 --> 36:37.062
Empire's in my blood.

36:37.095 --> 36:39.331
When I bleed, I bleed Empire.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.032
Now, I'm ask...

36:42.434 --> 36:43.835
I'm praying...

36:43.869 --> 36:46.538
that you'll forgive me, Pop.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.507
You still going to church?

36:48.540 --> 36:50.108
Yes, sir, yes, sir,
every Sunday.

36:50.141 --> 36:51.710
Still believe in God?
Yes, sir.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.512
Good.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.381
Then you pray to God
that He forgives you,

36:55.414 --> 36:56.548
'cause I don't.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.120
Pop, wait a minute.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.355
Pop!

37:03.389 --> 37:05.391
Pop!

37:09.295 --> 37:11.797
For years, you rejected Jamal
because of who he is.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.932
Now he's running the company.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.901
Hakeem, he slept
with your fiancée.

37:15.934 --> 37:19.538
Apparently, you want
him back at Empire.

37:19.571 --> 37:20.706
Here I stand,

37:20.739 --> 37:23.909
contrite, remorseful, humble.

37:25.277 --> 37:28.814
And yet you look at me...

37:28.847 --> 37:30.849
like I'm some kind of mutant.

37:34.119 --> 37:36.121
Why do you hate me?

37:38.357 --> 37:41.427
WOMAN: Dwight,
why are you so sad, baby?

37:41.460 --> 37:43.795
You want me
to sing you a song?

37:43.829 --> 37:46.097
What song
do you want me to sing?

37:46.131 --> 37:48.834
Hmm, "Itsy Bitsy Spider"?

37:48.867 --> 37:51.236
Again? Okay.

37:51.269 --> 37:56.308
* The itsy bitsy spider

37:56.342 --> 37:59.110
* Went up the water spout

37:59.144 --> 38:02.280
* Down came the rain

38:02.314 --> 38:05.317
* And washed the spider out

38:09.321 --> 38:12.958
(weakly):
* Out comes the sun

38:12.991 --> 38:18.430
* And dries up all the rain

38:18.464 --> 38:22.133
* And the itsy bitsy spider

38:22.167 --> 38:25.003
* Went up the spout again... *

38:28.407 --> 38:30.409
I don't hate you.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.317
(lock buzzes)

38:59.037 --> 39:02.140
JAMAL: * You know that I never
did let you down *

39:02.173 --> 39:03.809
* Why you don't come around

39:03.842 --> 39:05.811
* You don't come around, no

39:05.844 --> 39:08.880
* Da-da-da-da, you on top

39:08.914 --> 39:11.149
* It wasn't true
if it wasn't *

39:11.182 --> 39:15.721
* And sayin' sorry
just don't cut it *

39:15.754 --> 39:18.323
* Don't cut it

39:18.356 --> 39:22.828
* Saying sorry
just don't cut it *

39:22.861 --> 39:24.696
* Just don't

39:24.730 --> 39:26.832
* Just don't...

39:26.865 --> 39:28.667
What you think of that?

39:28.700 --> 39:29.835
I love it.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.236
I'm glad to hear
you singing again.

39:31.269 --> 39:33.171
I know it's been
hard to find time.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.306
Yeah.
I wrote this for you.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.910
I did.

39:40.612 --> 39:44.182
Come on home to Empire.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.485
We'll do more stuff together.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.387
That's what I miss.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.389
Yeah, me, too.

39:51.423 --> 39:53.825
But I ain't coming back
to Empire.

39:55.326 --> 39:57.028
What about your album?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.296
What about it?

39:58.329 --> 39:59.731
I put it out.
I leaked it online.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.603
Seriously?

40:06.137 --> 40:08.173
So that's how
we gonna roll, Hakeem?

40:09.174 --> 40:10.408
Yeah?

40:10.442 --> 40:13.044
You'll never see a penny.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.646
We'll sure the drawers
off your black ass.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.047
That's exactly why
I'm not coming back

40:16.081 --> 40:18.249
to your stupid-ass Empire.

40:18.283 --> 40:20.586
But tell Father

40:20.619 --> 40:22.921
when I get
to Madison Square Garden,

40:22.954 --> 40:24.222
I'm-a comp y'all
some VIP tickets.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.390
I got y'all.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.225
You ain't gonna sell out
the Garden.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.494
Not yet, but I will.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.228
And guess what, we got a name.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.429
It's called Lyon Dynasty.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.231
(sighs)

40:33.264 --> 40:34.399
That's corny.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.901
Get up out of here.
You corny.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.069
Jamal, you think you on top now,

40:38.103 --> 40:40.271
our little Dynasty's
gonna crush your Empire.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.644
* Oh, no, chain on froze

40:45.677 --> 40:48.413
* Sideline lookin',
what you hatin' on me for? *

40:48.446 --> 40:49.581
* Like, whoa

40:49.615 --> 40:51.583
* Don't be too bold

40:51.617 --> 40:53.318
* Better get ya coat
'cause I'm way too cold... *

40:53.351 --> 40:54.920
So it's just me and you?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.588
This is supposed to be
our new kingdom?

40:56.622 --> 40:59.591
Yeah, that's right.

40:59.625 --> 41:02.293
So take this broom
and help me.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.162
* Better get ya coat
'cause I'm way too cold *

41:04.195 --> 41:06.197
* Oh, oh...

41:11.970 --> 41:13.438
* Yeah...

41:13.471 --> 41:17.609
(siren wailing)

41:17.643 --> 41:19.277
RADIO DJ:
Whoo! Shots fired, New York.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.479
I cannot stop
playing this one.

41:21.513 --> 41:22.814
You already know this--
that exclusive

41:22.848 --> 41:25.050
Lucious Lyon joint.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.484
Classic Empire for you, baby.

41:26.518 --> 41:28.319
Right here.

41:28.353 --> 41:30.455
He dropped that from prison?
How?

41:30.488 --> 41:33.191
Your daddy, he has his ways.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.193
He always did.

41:35.226 --> 41:36.795
LUCIOUS:
* Down and dirty wit ya
* Come on! *

41:36.828 --> 41:38.129
* I'll pull up
on the hot block *

41:38.163 --> 41:40.298
* To come and get ya...
Damn, that's hot.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.001
You know he gonna
come after us hard.

41:43.034 --> 41:45.503
Well, there's not much
he can to do us right now.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.673
That's why we got to hurry up
and get this thing together

41:47.706 --> 41:48.974
before he gets out of jail.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.642
Come on.

41:50.676 --> 41:52.844
* You know I know it...!

41:52.878 --> 41:55.814
(protesters chanting outside)

41:55.847 --> 41:57.348
ROXANNE: Your Honor,
this is unacceptable.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.484
If the defense counsel
isn't present

41:59.517 --> 42:01.152
at the bail hearing
that he called,

42:01.186 --> 42:02.988
then he's wasting our time.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.556
The hell kind of lawyer

42:04.590 --> 42:05.657
doesn't show up for
his own hearing?

42:05.691 --> 42:07.325
(protestors continue
chanting outside)

42:07.358 --> 42:08.660
WOMAN (outside):
Let him go!

42:08.694 --> 42:09.728
(Roxanne scoffs)

42:09.761 --> 42:11.730
MAN (outside):
...you let Lucious go!

42:11.763 --> 42:13.699
MAN 2 (outside):
Let him go!

42:13.732 --> 42:15.500
(protestors continue shouting)

42:15.533 --> 42:16.501
THIRSTY: I'm here!

42:16.534 --> 42:18.837
I'm here,
I'm here, Your Honor.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.338
JUDGE ROBBINS: I was
this close to throwing

42:20.371 --> 42:22.574
your client back in jail,
Mr. Rawlings.

42:22.608 --> 42:23.875
My docket's backed up enough
as it is.

42:23.909 --> 42:25.543
The court
still validates, right?

42:26.712 --> 42:28.013
I-I got the new evidence
right here.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.581
Just bring it straight up here.

42:29.615 --> 42:31.449
Does counsel think he's not
going to share

42:31.482 --> 42:33.351
this new evidence
with the prosecutor?

42:33.384 --> 42:34.419
I wouldn't think
of it, Ms. Ford.

42:34.452 --> 42:35.553
Thank you.

42:46.431 --> 42:48.566
JUDGE ROBBINS:
I think I've...

42:48.600 --> 42:50.368
seen enough.

42:50.401 --> 42:53.038
This court finds
that Mr. Lyon

42:53.071 --> 42:55.607
poses no flight
risk and rules

42:55.641 --> 42:57.408
to release him on bail...
What?!

42:57.442 --> 42:58.877
Your Honor, this is a travesty!

42:58.910 --> 43:00.245
(camera shutters clicking)

43:00.278 --> 43:02.080
The people will
not stand by

43:02.113 --> 43:04.883
while you--
That is my ruling, Ms. Ford.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.885
Bail is granted
at one million dollars.

43:06.918 --> 43:14.159
ROXANNE:
Your Honor!
