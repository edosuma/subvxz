01:56.590 --> 01:57.850
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Ben.

01:58.050 --> 01:59.050
What gives?

01:59.220 --> 02:01.600
We're looking for a couple of Indians
broke out of jail.

02:02.970 --> 02:04.300
Young bucks in fancy shirts.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.150
If you see anything of them,
telephone my office at Palm Grove.

02:07.310 --> 02:08.729
Okay.

02:15.650 --> 02:17.900
Those Indians they're looking
for must be from around here.

02:18.070 --> 02:21.830
- They always head for home.
- Home being Key Largo.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.700
Want something, Jack?

03:06.870 --> 03:09.120
- Mr. Temple around?
- He ain't here.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.420
Hotel is closed.

03:10.580 --> 03:13.450
- When will he be back?
- I don't know.

03:28.020 --> 03:29.020
Have a beer?

03:29.190 --> 03:30.810
- The bar is closed.
- That's right.

03:30.980 --> 03:32.770
I told you, didn't I? Hotel's closed.

03:33.150 --> 03:35.190
In the summertime, everything's closed.

03:35.820 --> 03:37.650
Give him a drink.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.530
Give him a drink!

03:43.700 --> 03:46.160
You heard me! Give him a drink!

03:48.500 --> 03:50.750
- You said beer?
- Mmm-hmm.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.040
Thank you.

03:53.290 --> 03:55.090
Think nothing of it.

03:57.090 --> 04:01.250
Bargain Lass on the outside
is running very fast and very hard.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.800
It's Lady Bountiful,
they haven't caught her yet.

04:03.970 --> 04:05.600
Come on, Lady Bountiful.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.380
Come on, Lady Bountiful!

04:07.560 --> 04:08.680
Come on!

04:08.850 --> 04:10.600
Lady Bountiful by three lengths.

04:11.690 --> 04:12.770
How's that for picking them?

04:12.940 --> 04:14.690
Can I pick them or can't I?

04:20.440 --> 04:21.850
That's him.

04:26.370 --> 04:27.740
I'll take it up.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.910
If he wants you, he'll send for you.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.920
I like Fancy Free.

04:39.090 --> 04:42.180
Carrying 118 pounds.
That's a lot of weight.

04:42.340 --> 04:45.390
- What do you think?
- Fancy Free.

04:45.930 --> 04:47.720
- You play the ponies?
- No.

04:47.890 --> 04:49.730
- Why not?
- I haven't the money.

04:49.890 --> 04:53.650
Aw. Angel, another beer for the gentleman.

04:54.230 --> 04:55.900
You see, I play the long shots.

04:56.270 --> 04:58.400
Betting on a favorite, what do you win?

04:58.650 --> 05:01.030
When a horse comes in for me,
he pays plenty.

05:01.190 --> 05:02.940
Take Fancy Free,

05:03.570 --> 05:06.160
"Morning Line, 12-1."

05:06.320 --> 05:08.230
Oops, that's ridiculous.

05:08.410 --> 05:10.790
He should be 4-1, even less.

05:10.950 --> 05:12.110
Look at that breeding.

05:12.290 --> 05:16.380
"By Chance Play,
out of Misconstrue by Omaha."

05:16.880 --> 05:18.960
Course, he hasn't won in 11 starts, true.

05:19.130 --> 05:20.510
But he's been twice on the money.

05:20.670 --> 05:23.300
And today he's running
a $3,000 claiming race.

05:23.470 --> 05:25.180
Ought to be a cinch.

05:25.430 --> 05:26.470
Yes?

05:26.720 --> 05:27.760
What's your name?

05:27.970 --> 05:30.430
McCloud. Frank. By John, out of Helen.

05:31.890 --> 05:32.930
I'm Miss Dawn.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.480
Miss Gaye Dawn.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.260
You. He wants you.

05:39.770 --> 05:42.770
Uh, please excuse me.

05:51.620 --> 05:52.790
Who's that?

05:53.080 --> 05:54.620
- I don't know.
- What's he want?

05:54.960 --> 05:56.120
Old man Temple.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.170
Look, mister, if you're thinking
of putting up here, the hotel's closed.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.420
- Won't be open for another month.
- What are you doin' here?

06:04.630 --> 06:05.970
- We're guests.
- Yeah, but you just said...

06:06.130 --> 06:08.040
We're here by special arrangement.

06:09.260 --> 06:11.430
I don't plan to stay.
I just wanna see Mr. Temple.

06:12.010 --> 06:13.550
Oh, well, why didn't you say so?

06:13.970 --> 06:15.340
He's out by the boathouse.

06:38.170 --> 06:39.460
- Mr. Temple?
- Yeah?

06:39.830 --> 06:41.620
My name's McCloud. Frank McCloud.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.380
McCloud, huh?

06:45.010 --> 06:47.300
- Well, not Major McCloud?
- Yes, sir.

06:47.470 --> 06:48.510
Nora!

06:48.880 --> 06:51.040
Nora! Nora!

06:51.350 --> 06:53.470
Come here! When did you get here?

06:53.640 --> 06:55.520
A few minutes ago.
I'm on my way to Key West.

06:55.770 --> 06:58.020
Did you come on the bus? I saw it stop.

06:58.190 --> 06:59.560
Hey, Nora!

06:59.730 --> 07:00.900
Hurry up!

07:01.150 --> 07:02.360
Come here!

07:03.230 --> 07:04.610
Look who's here.

07:05.190 --> 07:06.900
This is George's wife.

07:07.070 --> 07:08.610
This is Major Frank McCloud.

07:08.820 --> 07:09.870
How do you do, Mrs. Temple?

07:10.030 --> 07:12.450
Your husband and I were
in the same outfit overseas.

07:12.620 --> 07:14.160
As if she didn't know.

07:14.580 --> 07:16.410
I wrote you a letter, Major, to St. Louis.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.530
It was sent on to Portland,
St. Paul and Memphis,

07:18.710 --> 07:20.330
all those places, before it came back.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.250
- Ever been down here before?
- No, sir.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.080
George was right.

07:25.380 --> 07:28.300
The Keys are different than
anything I've ever seen. And hotter.

07:28.470 --> 07:31.680
Uh, don't look for it to get
any cooler before November.

07:32.260 --> 07:34.760
The thermometer will go down to about 100.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.890
The sand flies and mosquitoes
will disappear.

07:38.730 --> 07:42.020
It'll be right livable for about
three months on the Keys.

07:42.190 --> 07:43.570
Except for the tourists.

07:44.940 --> 07:47.320
- That Black Caesar's Rock?
- How'd you know?

07:47.740 --> 07:50.240
For one who's never been here,
I know a lot about these Keys.

07:50.860 --> 07:52.810
They were a favorite subject with George.

07:53.070 --> 07:56.070
He used to dig
for pirate gold right over there.

07:56.540 --> 08:00.170
He never lost hope of finding
Blackbeard's own treasure.

08:00.790 --> 08:03.080
He must've dug 10,000 holes.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.550
- Ever find anything?
- Oh, sure.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.220
Saltwater, every time.

08:08.550 --> 08:10.430
How long you gonna be with us, Major?

08:10.720 --> 08:12.720
- An hour or so.
- An hour?

08:12.930 --> 08:16.560
You can spare more time than that, surely.
We got a lot to talk about.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.260
I'll talk as long as you like, Mr. Temple.

08:18.430 --> 08:20.140
Good, then you'll stay overnight.

08:20.770 --> 08:22.310
He can have George's room.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.680
Yes, Dad.

08:25.650 --> 08:27.360
- May I help you?
- Yeah, if you will, please.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.980
Afternoon, Mrs. Temple.

08:34.820 --> 08:38.030
Mr. Temple.
Any news of the Osceola brothers?

08:38.200 --> 08:39.750
Oh, I'm sorry, Ben.

08:40.409 --> 08:44.080
I want you to meet my son's
commanding officer, Major McCloud.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.880
- How do you do?
- Officer Ben Wade. Sawyer.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.040
How do you do?

08:48.210 --> 08:50.470
If you don't mind, Mr. Temple,
we'd like to have a look around.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.800
Ah, you won't find those Indians,
'cause they ain't here.

08:54.470 --> 08:57.600
Maybe they're in the mangrove swamps.
Maybe.

08:57.810 --> 09:01.020
Or maybe if you wanna go wading,
you might find them. Maybe.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.440
But if I was you,
I'd save myself the trouble.

09:04.810 --> 09:07.690
No doubt they'll give
themselves up before morning.

09:08.650 --> 09:11.990
Well, they sure enough ought to.
That's a fact, Mr. Temple.

09:12.150 --> 09:15.160
'Cause the longer they stay at large,
the tougher it's gonna be on 'em.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.870
Fool Indians.
Thirty days to do and they bust out.

09:18.030 --> 09:22.620
Well, 30 days in jail for an Indian
is like 30 years for somebody else.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.960
Anyway, I'd like to have a look around.

09:25.170 --> 09:28.130
Now, look here, Clyde, if Mr. Temple
says they ain't here, they ain't.

09:28.290 --> 09:30.660
His word's good enough for me,
and it ought to be good enough for you.

09:31.010 --> 09:33.010
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Temple.
Come on, Clyde.

09:34.680 --> 09:38.350
Those two brothers and my boy, George,
grew up together.

09:38.510 --> 09:40.060
There's no harm in them.

09:40.220 --> 09:43.890
They just went to Palm Grove
and got a little snootful

09:44.180 --> 09:46.850
and started to take Florida
back for the Indians.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.320
Came mighty near succeeding, too.

09:49.480 --> 09:52.150
I sent word for them to
come in and give themselves up.

09:52.530 --> 09:55.450
Not that I'm supposed to know where
they are, you understand.

09:56.070 --> 10:00.370
Oh, Major, I want you to meet
Mr., uh, Mr....

10:00.530 --> 10:01.690
- Bass.
- Garcia.

10:01.870 --> 10:02.870
We've already met.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.210
My son's commanding officer overseas.

10:05.370 --> 10:06.370
Yeah?

10:06.540 --> 10:09.000
They were in the
Italian Campaign together.

10:09.210 --> 10:11.670
- From Salerno to Cassino.
- Yeah.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.720
My boy, George, was killed in Cassino.

10:14.970 --> 10:16.010
Yeah?

10:28.020 --> 10:29.610
What's going on here?

10:29.900 --> 10:31.020
Nothing, Mr. Temple.

10:31.190 --> 10:32.690
What's the matter with her?

10:33.190 --> 10:36.240
- Nora? Nora!
- Yes, Father.

10:36.450 --> 10:38.530
What ails that girl? She hurt?

10:39.200 --> 10:41.080
Case of one too many,
that's all, Mr. Temple.

10:41.240 --> 10:45.000
Now, look here! If you people can't
behave yourselves, you gotta leave.

10:45.410 --> 10:46.830
What did you hit her for?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.750
I'll let you in on something.
She's a lush, the lady.

10:50.290 --> 10:53.130
After she bends the elbow a few times,
she begins to see things,

10:53.750 --> 10:55.830
rats, roaches, snakes, bats, you know.

10:56.630 --> 10:58.930
A sock in the kisser is the only thing
that'll bring her out of it.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.060
Your room's ready, Major.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.940
How long have they been here?

11:08.480 --> 11:10.650
That one, Curly, and the woman
showed up first.

11:10.940 --> 11:12.650
Dad Temple told them
we were closed for the summer,

11:12.820 --> 11:14.780
but he offered to rent
the whole hotel for a week.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.570
It was so much money,
Dad couldn't afford to turn it down.

11:18.150 --> 11:21.020
Mr. Brown and the others arrived
in that big boat four days ago.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.330
Which one is Brown?

11:22.620 --> 11:25.500
He's in number 11. Never comes out
of his room except at night.

11:25.790 --> 11:26.910
What's he like?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.830
He's a lady-killer, or thinks so.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.160
Rich, I guess, from the way the others
jump when he lifts a finger.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.090
Out of season in this heat.

11:34.630 --> 11:37.130
Why would they decide
to sit down on Key Largo?

11:38.300 --> 11:40.140
They'll be leaving here
tonight or tomorrow.

11:41.590 --> 11:42.790
Major?

11:45.100 --> 11:47.730
- Were you with George when he died?
- Yes.

11:48.310 --> 11:49.730
Was he in very much pain?

11:50.190 --> 11:51.650
He never knew what hit him.

11:53.150 --> 11:54.770
I was afraid he might have suffered.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.820
Come down to Dad's room
when you're ready, Major.

12:32.060 --> 12:33.190
Excuse me.

12:33.850 --> 12:35.100
Staying the night, huh?

12:35.650 --> 12:36.900
I'm Curly Hoff.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.110
I heard how you were with
old man Temple's son in Italy.

12:40.690 --> 12:41.980
The kid got it, huh?

12:42.200 --> 12:43.360
Ah, too bad.

12:43.910 --> 12:46.700
I hope you didn't take offense
at the way we handled you downstairs.

12:46.870 --> 12:49.040
You caught Toots and me at a bad time.

12:49.370 --> 12:51.410
We were ready to bite anybody's head off.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.530
Especially a certain blonde's.

12:54.210 --> 12:57.420
Look, five of us. We come down here
for the deep-sea fishing.

12:57.590 --> 12:58.880
All the way from Milwaukee.

12:59.090 --> 13:03.180
More than a year, we'd been planning
to come down here and fish our brains out.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.220
So what happens? One guy brings a blonde.

13:06.390 --> 13:08.720
And after we all swore
up and down, no dames!

13:08.930 --> 13:10.850
But he's gotta bring her, this guy.

13:11.060 --> 13:14.480
Well, if she isn't drunk and crying,
she's got a hangover and arguing.

13:14.850 --> 13:17.560
One minute she gets sore at you
and won't talk to you at all.

13:17.770 --> 13:20.430
The next she's making a play for you
right in front of the guy.

13:20.690 --> 13:23.030
And he gets sore at us, mind you, not her.

13:23.610 --> 13:26.370
Everything's spoiled,
including our dispositions.

13:26.910 --> 13:29.240
It's cost us all this dough, and for what?

13:29.450 --> 13:30.620
The world's worst time.

13:31.950 --> 13:34.280
Now, I ask you, can you blame us
for getting rude?

13:34.580 --> 13:36.710
- No, I don't blame you.
- How about a little drink, pal?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.250
Not right now, thanks.

13:38.540 --> 13:39.580
Hotel Largo.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.550
Come on, just to show
there's no hard feelings.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.880
No, thank you.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.470
Oh, thank you very much.

13:46.050 --> 13:48.100
- Storm signals are up.
- What does that mean?

13:48.350 --> 13:49.760
Hurricane's on its way.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.430
See what I mean? Hurricanes yet.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.090
Dad's in here, Major.

13:59.610 --> 14:00.650
Sit down, Major.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.150
The war's over, Mr. Temple.
I'm not a Major anymore.

14:04.320 --> 14:08.700
Oh, I know the men that were in it
don't like talking about the war,

14:09.240 --> 14:11.540
and I don't like imposing on you.

14:12.620 --> 14:16.920
But this letter here from the War
Department is the only facts we have.

14:17.670 --> 14:21.250
And, well, it leaves us in the dark
about a few things.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.260
I'll tell you everything I know,
Mr. Temple.

14:23.590 --> 14:25.050
Will you, Frank? Will you?

14:25.470 --> 14:26.800
I'd be most grateful.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.960
- Where shall I start?
- Anywhere.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.140
Well, he was a good soldier, Mr. Temple,
from start to finish.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.980
You'd have been proud of him
like every man in his regiment was.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.430
- Were they, Frank?
- And with good reason.

14:40.110 --> 14:41.480
It wasn't just a matter of doing his duty.

14:41.650 --> 14:44.400
He was always looking
for a way to do more.

14:44.570 --> 14:46.200
And finding it.

14:46.990 --> 14:48.780
George was a born hero, Mr. Temple.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.290
He couldn't imagine his death.
Only dishonor.

14:52.490 --> 14:53.910
No, of course not.

14:54.330 --> 14:56.620
It's a wonder he lasted till Cassino.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.540
When you believe like George believed,
maybe dying isn't very important.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.840
Once, outside San Pietro,
George and a couple of others

15:07.010 --> 15:09.140
established a forward observation post.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.170
They got a direct hit,
and the others were killed.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.390
That left it up to George.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.520
For three days and three nights
he stayed awake directing our fire.

15:18.190 --> 15:20.560
Most of that time,
I was on the other end of the line.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.190
To keep himself awake,
he talked into the phone.

15:24.980 --> 15:26.520
Talked and talked.

15:27.690 --> 15:29.730
Most of his talk was about you two.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.740
You'd be surprised how much
I know about you both.

15:33.530 --> 15:36.530
For instance, inside your wedding ring,
Nora, there's an inscription,

15:37.040 --> 15:38.160
"Evermore."

15:39.000 --> 15:40.080
That's right.

15:40.580 --> 15:41.710
And you, Mr. Temple.

15:42.330 --> 15:45.540
Do you remember telling George what
this hollow is above the upper lip?

15:46.380 --> 15:50.340
Before he was born, you said
he knew all the secrets of life and death.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.560
Then at the moment of his birth, an angel
came and put his finger right here.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.260
And sealed his lips.

15:58.140 --> 16:00.060
I remember that. Yup.

16:01.350 --> 16:05.400
He couldn't have been more than seven years
old when I told him that fairy story.

16:07.030 --> 16:08.610
What's it like where he's buried?

16:10.110 --> 16:12.320
Just crosses on a slope.

16:13.620 --> 16:15.450
High up, there's what's left of a church.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.400
You can see a river from where George is.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.500
I'd like to pay a visit to that place.

16:23.420 --> 16:24.750
Yep, I would.

16:25.880 --> 16:28.550
Nora, maybe we'll do just that.

16:29.630 --> 16:32.590
Go to Italy and see
where George is buried.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.970
It belongs to us, don't it?
That plot of ground?

16:38.770 --> 16:40.770
I'm very grateful to you, Frank.

16:41.390 --> 16:42.390
Thank you.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.930
There was a storm warning, Dad.

16:50.780 --> 16:52.360
You better see to the boat, dear.

17:25.980 --> 17:27.319
What brought you down this way, Frank?

17:27.480 --> 17:30.070
I like the sea and thought maybe
I'd like to make my living on it.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.950
- Doing what?
- Doesn't matter. Hand on a fishing boat.

17:33.150 --> 17:35.770
Life on land's become
too complicated for my taste.

17:36.490 --> 17:37.990
What did you do before the war, Frank?

17:38.280 --> 17:39.980
I was circulation manager for a newspaper.

17:40.330 --> 17:43.080
- You never went back to it?
- Yeah, but I couldn't stick it.

17:44.790 --> 17:46.710
I've done lot of things
since I left the paper.

17:47.170 --> 17:50.000
Driving taxis, waiting on tables,
anything to make a dollar.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.630
Including day labor.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.220
Getting kind of rough.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.180
Major, this is Mr. Feeney.

17:56.380 --> 17:57.710
- Hi, pal.
- How do you do?

18:00.680 --> 18:02.350
How's your ground tackle off the stern?

18:02.520 --> 18:03.560
Plenty heavy.

18:04.310 --> 18:07.360
Then we'd better just double up
on these bowlines.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.190
Where'd you learn about boats?

18:13.900 --> 18:15.910
My first sweetheart was a boat.

18:18.870 --> 18:19.950
Hey!

18:20.490 --> 18:22.040
How do you like that boat?

18:23.040 --> 18:26.500
Nice craft. She ought to be away
from those reefs with this blow comin' up.

18:26.710 --> 18:28.080
That so?

18:36.050 --> 18:37.590
Put that on that piling over there.

19:07.620 --> 19:08.830
Charlie!

19:09.500 --> 19:11.920
Charlie Wenoka and his family,
Crawfish Island.

19:12.750 --> 19:16.130
The Wenokas are royalty.
Charlie's a prince of the Seminole nation.

19:16.380 --> 19:18.590
His ancestors go back to the gods.

19:18.930 --> 19:21.260
He sells seashells by the seashore.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.740
Hello, Mama Ochobee.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.670
Every Indian around here is
a descendent of Mama Ochobee.

19:56.960 --> 20:00.630
She admits to being 108 years old.
But she has a son who's 112.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.220
So, we suspect Mama doesn't tell
the truth about her age.

20:03.390 --> 20:04.970
New husband?

20:05.260 --> 20:07.880
Him new husband? No, Mama.
Not new husband.

20:09.310 --> 20:10.980
- Got cigarette?
- What?

20:11.270 --> 20:12.980
- You got cigarette?
- Yeah.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.910
Pretty big blow coming, Mama?

20:26.120 --> 20:27.330
Pretty big.

20:32.170 --> 20:34.880
The Indians always know.
Don't ask me how, but they do.

20:35.040 --> 20:38.660
More will be along. They always come to
us from as far as Matecumbe Key.

20:39.010 --> 20:42.180
This one was born in our hotel lobby
during the last big blow, weren't you?

20:42.340 --> 20:43.470
Yes.

20:45.350 --> 20:46.850
Hello, Tom. Hello, John.

20:47.010 --> 20:49.170
- Tom and Johnny Osceola, Frank.
- How are you do?

20:49.470 --> 20:50.760
- How do you do?
- Hello.

20:51.020 --> 20:54.440
We get Mr. Temple message.
We here give ourself up to police.

20:54.650 --> 20:56.150
He thinks it's the best thing.

20:56.310 --> 20:58.220
What Mr. Temple say, we do.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.860
Him good friend to Indian.

21:00.110 --> 21:03.160
Why don't you go on over to the hotel?
And Dad'll call Palm Grove.

21:03.450 --> 21:04.530
Thanks, Miss Nora.

21:13.250 --> 21:16.000
Poor fellas, they got into some trouble
and were arrested.

21:16.170 --> 21:18.250
Yes, I know.
Mr. Temple told me about them.

21:18.420 --> 21:21.090
They really trust Dad Temple.
All the Indians.

21:21.510 --> 21:24.180
As far as they're concerned,
he's the United States of America.

21:24.930 --> 21:26.390
You're very happy here, aren't you?

21:26.850 --> 21:28.810
- Very.
- You're never lonely?

21:31.020 --> 21:33.230
Did George tell you?
I met him at a USO dance.

21:33.850 --> 21:35.440
He was lonesome. He wanted company.

21:36.270 --> 21:37.820
I was working at a defense plant.

21:38.270 --> 21:40.810
I knew lots of people,
but I was lonesome, too.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.610
Before George, my life
hadn't made much sense.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.740
I never had much of a home,
and I didn't like what I had.

21:48.120 --> 21:49.120
George...

21:49.450 --> 21:50.870
George gave me roots.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.790
When he went overseas,
I came down here to stay with his father.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.500
And the roots took hold.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.000
Now I'm, I'm like one of those mangroves.

22:11.220 --> 22:12.930
Our local police always get their Indian.

22:13.270 --> 22:15.390
You close the shutters
while I get the oil lamps.

22:53.470 --> 22:55.840
Hey, pal. Getting ready
for the hurricane, eh?

22:56.270 --> 22:58.020
How's about joining me
for that little drink now?

22:58.310 --> 22:59.310
No, thanks.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.470
- You're not a drinking man?
- No, not right now.

23:01.730 --> 23:02.780
Hey, Curly.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.610
What all happens in a hurricane?

23:05.150 --> 23:08.320
The wind blows so hard
the ocean gets up on its hind legs

23:08.490 --> 23:09.910
and walks right across the land.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.690
And singing this song,

23:11.910 --> 23:15.120
"Rain, rain go away.
Little Ralphie wants to play."

23:17.160 --> 23:18.990
Isn't that Ben Wade's car?

23:19.540 --> 23:21.210
Nora! Have you seen him?

23:21.500 --> 23:22.840
No, Dad, I haven't.

23:23.340 --> 23:24.510
Here's a good one.

23:24.670 --> 23:27.550
They're snooping around looking
for these two boys, and here they are.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.390
Better go out there and sit
in his car and wait for him.

23:31.550 --> 23:33.500
Or better yet, go and find him.

23:38.060 --> 23:39.190
What's so funny, Toots?

23:39.350 --> 23:40.940
There are two cons in a cell, see?

23:41.190 --> 23:43.480
And one con was trying to sell
the other one a fountain pen.

23:43.860 --> 23:45.900
And he says,
"This pen is guaranteed for life."

23:47.530 --> 23:48.650
What's the matter? Don't you get it?

23:48.990 --> 23:50.030
A con.

23:50.490 --> 23:51.910
"Guaranteed for life."

23:52.240 --> 23:53.490
We get it, all right.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.540
Have you seen Wade or Sawyer
anywhere around, Frank?

23:56.700 --> 23:57.700
No, sir, I haven't.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.880
- His car's out there in the rain.
- Yes, I know.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.330
It's funny.

24:02.540 --> 24:05.090
How about a drink, everybody?
What'll it be, Miss Temple?

24:05.460 --> 24:06.550
Nothing, thanks.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.170
- How about you, Pop?
- Uh...

24:08.340 --> 24:09.680
He's not supposed to drink anything.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.260
That leaves it up to you, pal.

24:13.090 --> 24:14.170
Another time.

24:14.890 --> 24:15.930
What's the matter? Don't you like me?

24:16.100 --> 24:18.230
I'm beginning to think
I got smallpox or something.

24:21.730 --> 24:23.940
Are you still laughin'
at that stinking joke?

24:24.150 --> 24:25.190
Here's another one.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.150
Elevator's busting through a roof, see?

24:27.440 --> 24:29.650
And the elevator boy's saying
to a couple of passengers,

24:30.320 --> 24:32.070
"I told you there was no 11th floor."

24:35.330 --> 24:36.830
Explain it for us, Toots.

24:38.580 --> 24:39.620
Wise guy.

24:43.460 --> 24:44.500
What's the idea of them?

24:45.420 --> 24:47.840
They shut the electricity off,
we still have light.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.970
I hear that a hurricane blows off roofs,

24:51.130 --> 24:52.930
uproots trees and puts
the snatch on people.

24:53.220 --> 24:55.850
And they all go flyin' around
in the sky together. Is that right?

24:56.470 --> 24:57.600
Absolutely.

24:57.850 --> 25:01.310
It's raining in on Ben's car.
You better close the windows, Nora.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.890
Ralph, go put up the windows in that car.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.430
What, get caught out in that hurricane?
Not me, brother.

25:08.020 --> 25:09.270
I'll take it.

25:13.110 --> 25:14.450
Don't you answer it.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.290
Yes?

25:21.200 --> 25:23.030
No, Mr. Temple's not here now.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.790
No, she's not here either.

25:26.880 --> 25:27.920
Me?

25:28.130 --> 25:29.800
I'm a guest at the hotel.

25:31.340 --> 25:32.760
No, we haven't seen him.

25:33.050 --> 25:34.300
Give me that phone.

25:35.510 --> 25:38.510
Yes. If Sawyer shows up,
I'll have him call you right back.

25:46.150 --> 25:47.520
Easy does it, soldier.

26:23.470 --> 26:26.800
The phone rang, and the girl
started for it and I stopped her.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.900
The soldier wants to get rough,
so we show him our rods.

26:30.360 --> 26:33.190
I'm glad the old man's in a wheelchair.
He'd be lots of trouble.

26:33.740 --> 26:35.530
- Who was on the phone?
- The law.

26:36.700 --> 26:38.490
That means he won't be long.

26:38.700 --> 26:39.740
Then what?

26:39.990 --> 26:41.160
We'll see.

26:47.580 --> 26:49.540
You'd think this rain would
cool things off, but it don't.

26:51.250 --> 26:53.880
- Gonna have a hurricane, are we?
- Yeah, so they say.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.880
I'm not afraid of that gun.

26:56.050 --> 26:57.720
Go ahead! Shoot!

26:57.970 --> 26:59.930
Yeah, I'm not afraid.

27:03.720 --> 27:04.800
Brown!

27:05.060 --> 27:06.690
Hey, you! Brown!

27:25.540 --> 27:28.670
Are you thieves or what? You want money?
Is this a robbery?

27:28.830 --> 27:31.170
That's right, Pop.
We're gonna steal all your towels.

27:31.330 --> 27:34.790
That big gun in your hand
makes you look grown-up, you think.

27:35.420 --> 27:39.090
I'll bet you spend hours posing
in front of a mirror holding it.

27:39.380 --> 27:40.830
Trying to look tough.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.930
- Shut up.
- You scum.

27:43.350 --> 27:44.520
Toots...

27:45.430 --> 27:48.140
- Tell him not to call me names.
- Shut up, Toots.

27:50.940 --> 27:52.150
Now, listen.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.730
I don't want any trouble.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.570
With you. With anybody.

27:59.150 --> 28:00.560
Now, how about it? Gonna act sensible?

28:00.740 --> 28:02.450
Why are they pointing those guns at us?

28:02.700 --> 28:05.700
Now, look, Pop. Forget the questions.
What you don't know won't hurt you.

28:06.450 --> 28:07.960
We'll be out of here in a couple of hours.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.540
Try to put up with us that long, huh?

28:12.540 --> 28:13.920
What're we gonna eat tonight, sister?

28:14.130 --> 28:15.300
Pompano, maybe?

28:15.460 --> 28:18.010
Am I to understand we're your prisoners?

28:18.260 --> 28:22.510
Well, put it this way, Pop, you're gonna
be my guests for a little while.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.810
You know, back in Chi, in the old days,

28:26.970 --> 28:29.260
we used to pay $8 to $10
for an order of pompano.

28:30.310 --> 28:32.810
They used to fly it in,
the way they served it,

28:33.350 --> 28:35.430
done up in a brown paper bag.

28:36.690 --> 28:37.860
Got any champagne, miss?

28:39.440 --> 28:40.480
No champagne.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.280
Well, that's too bad.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.330
Champagne and pompano.

28:45.490 --> 28:46.790
They really go together.

28:52.170 --> 28:53.460
This one's coming around.

28:57.460 --> 28:58.670
Still feel tough?

29:06.510 --> 29:07.680
Sawyer.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.850
You won't get away with it, Rocco.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.530
Why'd you hurt that boy?

29:28.580 --> 29:29.790
He's a cop, that's why.

29:29.950 --> 29:31.000
Well, who are you?

29:31.540 --> 29:32.660
Why are you here?

29:33.370 --> 29:35.830
- Answer me!
- Oh, stop hollering, old man.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.300
Johnny Rocco, of course.

29:40.130 --> 29:41.340
Hot water.

29:44.680 --> 29:45.800
Get some.

29:48.640 --> 29:49.850
Yeah, that's right.

29:50.810 --> 29:52.180
Johnny Rocco.

29:52.770 --> 29:55.060
- I know that name.
- Sure, Pop. Who doesn't?

29:55.270 --> 29:57.440
Johnny Rocco the gangster, Mr. Temple.

29:57.980 --> 29:59.730
The one and only Rocco.

30:00.070 --> 30:02.190
Rocco. Rocco?

30:02.860 --> 30:04.910
What's that, Pop? I'm kind of deaf.

30:05.110 --> 30:06.280
Rocco!

30:06.610 --> 30:07.730
Oh.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.240
He said, "Rocco."

30:14.120 --> 30:15.920
But they threw you out of the country.

30:16.420 --> 30:17.580
Yeah.

30:18.580 --> 30:19.790
Yeah, that's right.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.760
After living in the USA
for more than 30 years,

30:22.920 --> 30:25.260
they... They called me
an undesirable alien.

30:26.180 --> 30:27.430
Me, Johnny Rocco.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.720
Like I was a dirty Red or somethin'.

30:31.260 --> 30:32.630
Then how could you be here?

30:33.810 --> 30:35.100
Well, maybe I'm not, Pop.

30:36.020 --> 30:38.560
This ain't real, what's happenin'.
You're having a dream.

30:38.730 --> 30:40.070
Wake up, Pop. You're snoring.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.650
You're right.

30:41.860 --> 30:43.610
You shouldn't have been deported.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.280
You should've been exterminated.

30:48.950 --> 30:50.120
Rocco...

30:51.580 --> 30:52.870
I must apologize for Mr. Temple.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.460
He doesn't know what he's talking about,
or, who to.

30:55.960 --> 30:59.290
Sir, Johnny Rocco was more than a king.
He was an emperor.

30:59.790 --> 31:02.800
His rule extended over beer,
slot machines, the numbers racket,

31:02.960 --> 31:04.630
and a dozen other forbidden enterprises.

31:05.260 --> 31:06.510
He was a master of the fix.

31:07.090 --> 31:10.390
Whom he couldn't corrupt, he terrified.
Whom he couldn't terrify, he murdered.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.930
You filth. You city filth.

31:14.100 --> 31:17.190
Oh, Mr. Temple, you're
hopelessly old-fashioned.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.310
Your ideas date back years.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.320
You're still living in the time
when America thought

31:21.480 --> 31:23.480
it could get along
without the Johnny Roccos.

31:24.070 --> 31:26.530
Welcome back, Rocco. It was all a mistake.

31:27.030 --> 31:29.160
America's sorry for what it did to you.

31:29.820 --> 31:31.700
On the level, boss, were you that big?

31:31.910 --> 31:33.740
On the level, are you that dumb?

31:35.490 --> 31:36.610
Yeah.

31:37.830 --> 31:38.870
Yeah, that's me.

31:40.670 --> 31:42.170
Sure, I was all of those things.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.000
And more.

31:44.550 --> 31:46.670
When Rocco talked,
everybody shut up and listened.

31:47.090 --> 31:48.380
What Rocco said, went.

31:49.050 --> 31:50.340
Nobody was as big as Rocco.

31:51.970 --> 31:53.600
It'll be like that again, only more so.

31:54.510 --> 31:56.170
I'll be back up there one of these days.

31:56.470 --> 31:57.930
And then you're gonna
really see something.

31:58.180 --> 32:00.760
If the time ever comes when your kind

32:00.940 --> 32:03.320
can walk a city street in daylight

32:03.480 --> 32:05.530
with nothing to fear from the people...

32:05.860 --> 32:08.030
The time has come, Mr. Temple. It's here.

32:08.990 --> 32:10.110
Okay.

32:10.860 --> 32:11.940
You know all about me.

32:13.530 --> 32:15.040
Now, what's with you, wise guy?

32:17.120 --> 32:18.250
Well, give.

32:18.620 --> 32:20.420
- In the war, weren't you?
- Yes.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.790
- Get any medals?
- A couple.

32:24.380 --> 32:26.340
- Brave, huh?
- Not very.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.290
- Why'd you stick your neck out?
- No good reason.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.050
What are you saying, Frank?

32:32.390 --> 32:34.050
I believed some words.

32:34.850 --> 32:36.010
Words? What words?

32:36.720 --> 32:40.640
Well, they went like this,
"But we are not making all this sacrifice

32:40.810 --> 32:42.730
"of human effort and human lives

32:42.900 --> 32:46.730
"to return to the kind of a world
we had after the last world war."

32:48.070 --> 32:49.110
Huh.

32:56.620 --> 32:59.450
"We're fighting to cleanse
the world of ancient evils.

33:00.370 --> 33:01.540
"Ancient ills."

33:03.710 --> 33:04.840
What's that all about?

33:05.580 --> 33:07.080
I remember those words.

33:07.590 --> 33:08.760
Well, that makes two of us.

33:10.130 --> 33:13.590
We rid ourselves of your kind
once and for all.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.390
You ain't comin' back!

33:15.590 --> 33:17.050
Who's gonna stop me, old man?

33:18.060 --> 33:19.890
If I wasn't a cripple...

33:20.060 --> 33:22.690
You wouldn't be talking this way.
Right, Pop?

33:23.100 --> 33:25.230
Filth! You filth!

33:25.400 --> 33:26.440
Get him, will you!

33:26.610 --> 33:28.110
- Sic him, Pop!
- Stand your ground!

33:28.270 --> 33:30.270
"Stand your ground."
You're killing me, Pop.

33:32.150 --> 33:34.600
Come on. Come on, Pop.
You're not quitting, are you?

33:34.780 --> 33:37.530
My boy, George, never quit,
and I ain't quitting.

33:37.950 --> 33:40.120
That's the spirit, Pop. Never say die.

33:55.470 --> 33:56.760
You little wildcat.

33:57.470 --> 33:58.890
Smelled blood, huh?

33:59.430 --> 34:00.600
Got your appetite up, huh?

34:03.140 --> 34:04.190
Hey, boss.

34:04.390 --> 34:05.640
Miami wants you on the phone.

34:27.290 --> 34:29.670
A whole bunch of people out on the porch,
look like Indians.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.340
- What do they want?
- They want in.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.420
- What for?
- The hurricane.

34:33.670 --> 34:34.840
All right, keep them out.

34:35.510 --> 34:36.639
Hello?

34:36.929 --> 34:38.179
Yeah, this is Mr. Brown.

34:38.679 --> 34:42.179
Hello? Oh, hello, Ziggy. How are you?

34:42.889 --> 34:44.560
I recognized your voice, yeah.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.690
Swell hearin' it again.

34:48.350 --> 34:50.219
How's every little thing?

34:51.520 --> 34:53.270
- Maybe it's the law.
- Right. Show him in.

34:53.860 --> 34:55.030
Hey, that's swell.

34:55.190 --> 34:56.310
This end, too.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.280
Look, when are you coming down?

34:59.530 --> 35:02.370
What hurricane? That right?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.250
- I want to see the boss.
- It's the skipper!

35:10.500 --> 35:12.250
- Mr. Temple, Mr. Temple, please!
- Well, look, uh...

35:12.420 --> 35:14.970
You're only a couple of hours away.
You can beat the hurricane out.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.090
No, it's gotta be tonight.

35:18.050 --> 35:19.550
Yeah, see you in a couple of hours.

35:20.220 --> 35:21.260
Bye.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.720
Storm warning. Big blow on the way.

35:25.350 --> 35:27.730
- So what?
- This coral reef not safe.

35:27.940 --> 35:29.810
Got to make for deep water right away.

35:30.310 --> 35:31.730
That boat stays right here.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.110
Too dangerous. Boat break up on reef.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.240
I tell you when to move that boat.

35:36.990 --> 35:38.110
I am skipper.

35:38.650 --> 35:39.900
Now, look.

35:40.410 --> 35:41.660
I paid you.

35:42.030 --> 35:43.950
- Now, you do what I say.
- Please, señor.

35:44.120 --> 35:46.040
You want half money back? I give.

35:46.330 --> 35:47.500
But got to move boat.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.240
Give me your rod.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.090
See this?

35:52.920 --> 35:54.920
You move that boat,
I'll blow your brains out.

35:55.250 --> 35:56.330
Okay, okay.

35:58.970 --> 36:00.550
We'll be out of here in a couple of hours.

36:01.010 --> 36:02.100
I'll be ready.

36:02.340 --> 36:04.500
Go out and move that car around the back.

36:05.310 --> 36:07.810
I come back here looking
for those Osceola boys.

36:08.390 --> 36:10.020
I knew they were somewhere around here.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.440
Down the lobby,
I ran up against these two.

36:13.980 --> 36:16.860
They didn't look right to me,
so I asked them a few questions.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.990
By the way they answered me,
I knew there was something fishy.

36:20.450 --> 36:22.240
So I put in a call to Ben Wade,

36:22.410 --> 36:24.530
but, before I can get through,
the lights went out on me.

36:26.950 --> 36:28.210
I woke up in there.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.710
Rocco was standing over me.

36:30.870 --> 36:32.780
I recognized him right away
from the pictures.

36:33.880 --> 36:36.800
I made a break for the door,
and the lights went out again.

36:37.460 --> 36:38.580
I'm the electrician.

36:50.810 --> 36:52.350
Angel. Shave.

36:53.810 --> 36:55.360
What did Miami have to say?

36:55.900 --> 36:57.110
Everything's okay.

36:57.860 --> 36:59.320
How soon will they be down?

36:59.490 --> 37:01.490
They were leaving right away.

37:06.530 --> 37:07.900
How're you feeling, copper?

37:09.120 --> 37:10.870
I'll say one thing, you sure can take it.

37:12.500 --> 37:15.000
By the way Toots poured it on,
I'm surprised you ever woke up.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.510
Phew. Boy, sure is hot.

37:19.880 --> 37:20.970
Not too close.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.340
So I won't get away with it, huh?

37:25.640 --> 37:28.220
How many times I heard that
from dumb coppers. I couldn't count.

37:28.510 --> 37:29.590
I still say it.

37:31.230 --> 37:33.350
You'd give your left eye
to nail me, wouldn't you, huh?

37:35.980 --> 37:37.440
You can see the headlines, can't you?

37:38.270 --> 37:40.520
"Local Deputy Captures Johnny Rocco."

37:41.530 --> 37:43.240
Your picture would be in all the papers.

37:44.320 --> 37:47.160
You might even get to tell on
the newsreel how you pulled it off.

37:47.620 --> 37:48.700
Yeah.

37:49.910 --> 37:51.160
Well, listen, hick.

37:51.540 --> 37:54.370
I was too much for any big-city
police force to handle.

37:55.210 --> 37:56.710
They tried, but they couldn't.

37:58.290 --> 38:00.700
Took the United States government
to pin a rap on me.

38:01.210 --> 38:02.620
Yeah, and they won't make it stick!

38:03.970 --> 38:05.510
You hick!

38:06.260 --> 38:09.060
I'll be back pulling strings to get guys
elected mayor and governor

38:09.220 --> 38:10.810
before you ever get 10-buck raise!

38:11.560 --> 38:12.560
Yeah.

38:12.890 --> 38:15.440
How many of those guys in office
owe everything to me?

38:16.400 --> 38:17.560
I made them.

38:17.900 --> 38:21.070
Yeah, I made them, just like a tailor
makes a suit of clothes.

38:21.820 --> 38:24.990
I take a nobody, see, teach him what to
say, get his name in the papers.

38:25.490 --> 38:27.320
I pay for his campaign expenses.

38:27.950 --> 38:31.080
Dish out a lot of groceries and coal.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.120
Get my boys to bring the voters out.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.420
And then count the votes,
over and over again

38:35.580 --> 38:37.250
till they added up right,
and he was elected.

38:39.380 --> 38:40.710
Then what happened?

38:41.920 --> 38:44.670
Did he remember when the going got tough?

38:44.840 --> 38:46.180
When the heat was on?

38:46.550 --> 38:47.930
No, he didn't want to.

38:48.590 --> 38:51.000
All he wanted was
to save his own dirty neck.

38:51.180 --> 38:53.430
Yeah, that's enough of that.
Give me a towel, will you?

38:54.020 --> 38:56.770
Yeah. "Public Enemy," he calls me!

38:58.310 --> 39:01.400
Me, who gave him his public,
all wrapped up with a fancy bow on it!

39:02.780 --> 39:04.150
Angel, lay my clothes out.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.350
- What suit?
- The gray one.

39:06.570 --> 39:09.280
- What color shirt?
- A white one, of course.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.410
Some little wildcat.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.880
I knew one like you a long time ago.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.840
Scratched, kicked, bit.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.090
Regular hellion.

39:28.590 --> 39:30.140
She even stuck a knife in me once.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.310
Irish kid.

39:33.510 --> 39:37.630
Little and kind of skinny she was
but a real fireball.

39:39.440 --> 39:41.110
Her name was Maggie Mooney.

39:42.860 --> 39:45.900
But for professional reasons,
I had her change it to Gaye Dawn.

39:46.860 --> 39:48.740
She was a knockout in those days.

40:15.930 --> 40:16.930
Hold on.

40:17.140 --> 40:18.270
Why, you...

40:39.710 --> 40:42.670
Go ahead, boss, smack her.
Get it out of your system.

40:43.040 --> 40:48.170
Look at him. The great Johnny Rocco
with Nora's spittle hanging from his face!

40:48.550 --> 40:49.550
Shut up, old man!

40:49.720 --> 40:51.970
Come over here. I'd like to spit on you.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.430
Give me. Give me!

40:58.770 --> 41:00.600
Nothing to stop me from
wiping you all out.

41:00.890 --> 41:03.760
What good will that do, boss? Forget it.
Her kind's a dime a dozen.

41:03.940 --> 41:05.770
I say smack her and let it go at that.

41:06.270 --> 41:08.310
Oh, that'd be right for you, Toots,
not for him.

41:09.070 --> 41:10.740
I need your advice, I ask for it.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.560
The Roccos don't,
or they wouldn't be Roccos.

41:13.740 --> 41:16.740
No, Toots. Smacking her isn't enough
for such an insult. He'd have to kill her.

41:17.780 --> 41:19.740
Then he'd have to kill
the rest of us because we witnessed it.

41:20.290 --> 41:23.290
Not just Mr. Temple and me,
but all the witnesses.

41:24.210 --> 41:25.540
It's kill us all or nothing.

41:25.750 --> 41:28.090
He needs you and Curly and Angel.

41:28.630 --> 41:29.760
So it'll be nothing.

41:32.470 --> 41:34.590
Wise guy.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.050
Unlock this door!

41:36.600 --> 41:38.770
Unlock this door! I want out!

41:40.890 --> 41:42.020
Let her out.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.360
I take off my hat to you, soldier.

41:54.780 --> 41:58.030
It's good thing you said what you did when
you said it, or he'd have started shooting.

41:58.740 --> 42:02.080
Close shave for you folks.
Closer than the one he got from Angel.

42:05.790 --> 42:07.960
Where is everybody? Downstairs?

42:13.050 --> 42:15.470
Oh... Hello, everybody.

42:16.260 --> 42:17.300
Hi, fella.

42:20.720 --> 42:21.810
Where's Johnny?

42:22.350 --> 42:23.730
He's in there getting dressed.

42:23.890 --> 42:24.940
I need a drink.

42:25.730 --> 42:27.480
What's everybody doing upstairs?

42:29.770 --> 42:30.770
Honey?

42:32.530 --> 42:33.900
Have you been crying?

42:34.650 --> 42:36.690
Why? Has somebody been mean to you?

42:37.360 --> 42:40.530
Him? Did you make her cry?
If you did, you ought to be ashamed.

42:40.870 --> 42:43.160
- How about a little drink, huh?
- No, thanks.

42:43.330 --> 42:45.670
- Oh, come on. It'll chase the blues away.
- No.

42:47.170 --> 42:48.670
- I'll have one.
- The boss said...

42:48.830 --> 42:50.660
I don't care what the boss said.
I need a drink.

42:51.840 --> 42:53.840
- Good evening, Mr. Temple.
- Miss.

42:54.840 --> 42:55.930
You got a cigarette?

42:56.840 --> 42:57.890
Thanks.

42:58.640 --> 42:59.850
Did your horse win?

43:00.220 --> 43:01.470
- Uh, my horse?
- Mm.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.560
Oh, no, I'm afraid he
ran out of the money.

43:03.720 --> 43:04.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.530
Oh...

43:17.400 --> 43:19.480
I think I'll go to my room.

43:23.490 --> 43:24.690
I feel faint.

43:25.910 --> 43:27.460
What I need is a drink.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.710
That's what I need.

43:30.210 --> 43:31.420
Say, how about it, you?

43:31.590 --> 43:32.880
How many times do I have to tell...

43:33.050 --> 43:34.550
The boss say you get no more drink.

43:34.710 --> 43:36.040
Oh, he did, did he?

43:36.550 --> 43:37.800
Well, this is a free country.

43:38.220 --> 43:39.720
If I want a drink, I can have one.

43:40.840 --> 43:43.130
I can buy my own. There!

43:43.310 --> 43:44.350
Sorry.

43:44.890 --> 43:47.480
- The boss say...
- The boss! The boss! He can go to...

43:48.310 --> 43:49.730
Oh, hello, darling.

43:50.730 --> 43:52.770
How come it's hotter at night
than in the day?

43:54.110 --> 43:55.650
And when it's raining than when it ain't?

43:57.070 --> 43:58.240
Huh, wise guy?

43:58.400 --> 43:59.400
I don't know.

44:00.530 --> 44:01.700
You don't know.

44:02.410 --> 44:04.160
I thought you knew all the answers.

44:04.790 --> 44:07.080
I thought you was a wise guy
from way back.

44:07.250 --> 44:09.250
Darling, you've hurt yourself!

44:09.620 --> 44:11.490
Your face! How in the world...

44:16.090 --> 44:17.260
Oh...

44:19.760 --> 44:20.970
- What's funny?
- Nothing.

44:21.680 --> 44:22.800
Then, why'd you laugh?

44:23.260 --> 44:24.390
I don't know.

44:24.850 --> 44:26.060
Dumbbell.

44:28.100 --> 44:29.440
What's worse, Curly?

44:29.770 --> 44:32.270
A dumbbell or a wise guy?

44:32.770 --> 44:34.230
A wise guy, I guess.

44:36.730 --> 44:38.640
Got a million dollars?

44:38.820 --> 44:39.860
No.

44:40.900 --> 44:42.440
- How much?
- Nothing.

44:42.860 --> 44:43.900
But you're a wise guy.

44:45.120 --> 44:48.040
Well, you see, I was educated
only in impractical things.

44:48.200 --> 44:49.650
With you, it's just the opposite.

44:53.130 --> 44:54.630
I'm afraid. I hate thunder.

44:54.790 --> 44:56.290
Is this it? Is it?

44:56.460 --> 44:58.170
- It's the beginning.
- I'm afraid!

44:58.340 --> 45:00.930
Well, can cars get through
during a hurricane?

45:01.090 --> 45:02.890
Maybe. Maybe not.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.140
I think I'll have a...

45:05.720 --> 45:07.680
- A scotch and water, please.
- No.

45:09.060 --> 45:10.850
- Please, darling.
- No!

45:12.060 --> 45:13.980
You know, what you were saying,
that's the truth.

45:14.230 --> 45:16.320
Only you don't believe it.
I can see right through you.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.150
What you really think is
"I'm better than Rocco.

45:19.190 --> 45:22.530
"He's filth!"
Like the old man said, right?

45:22.700 --> 45:23.700
Right.

45:23.910 --> 45:25.660
"He's got a gun, you think,
and I haven't."

45:25.870 --> 45:27.160
You figure it's the gun.

45:28.330 --> 45:29.700
Well, listen, soldier.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.670
Thousands of guys got guns,
but there's only one Johnny Rocco!

45:33.830 --> 45:35.130
How do you account for it?

45:35.420 --> 45:36.840
Well, he knows what he wants.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.590
- Don't you, Rocco?
- Sure.

45:38.750 --> 45:40.870
- What's that?
- Tell him, Rocco.

45:41.760 --> 45:43.300
Well, I want, uh...

45:43.590 --> 45:46.100
He wants more. Don't you, Rocco?

45:46.300 --> 45:48.130
Yeah, that's it. More.

45:48.310 --> 45:49.680
That's right, I want more.

45:50.020 --> 45:51.430
Will you ever get enough?

45:51.680 --> 45:53.180
Will you, Rocco?

45:53.520 --> 45:55.100
Well, I never have.

45:55.270 --> 45:56.690
No, I guess I won't.

45:57.980 --> 45:59.530
You, do you know what you want?

45:59.940 --> 46:02.780
Yes, and I had hopes once,
but I gave them up.

46:03.030 --> 46:04.320
Hopes for what?

46:04.570 --> 46:07.120
A world in which there's
no place for Johnny Rocco.

46:08.030 --> 46:09.400
Yeah?

46:11.540 --> 46:13.040
Okay, soldier.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.880
Here's your chance.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.040
Give me.

46:21.630 --> 46:24.090
Okay, soldier, you can make
your hopes come true.

46:25.470 --> 46:26.970
But you gotta die for it.

46:27.550 --> 46:29.430
See where I'm aiming? Right at your belly.

46:30.720 --> 46:31.890
Go ahead, shoot.

46:33.230 --> 46:35.100
- Get away, sister.
- Get away, Nora.

46:35.270 --> 46:36.270
Shoot!

46:37.400 --> 46:38.980
All right, you got a gun now.

46:39.360 --> 46:40.400
You gonna use it or not?

46:41.110 --> 46:42.150
Kill him, Major!

46:42.320 --> 46:44.110
Yeah, kill him, Major.

46:44.490 --> 46:47.240
Go ahead, show them
how you're not afraid to die.

46:47.570 --> 46:48.620
Shoot!

46:57.580 --> 46:59.590
Looks like you don't want it enough,
what you want.

47:04.010 --> 47:06.130
Tootsy laughs when something's
funny for a change.

47:06.760 --> 47:09.510
One Rocco more or less
isn't worth dying for.

47:11.810 --> 47:13.020
Give me that gun.

47:13.180 --> 47:14.930
Oh, no, I'm afraid you'd use it.

47:15.520 --> 47:18.150
One old man more or less
isn't worth dying for.

47:19.600 --> 47:21.010
What's the matter, sister?

47:22.270 --> 47:24.770
You look like you lost somebody
near and dear.

47:27.990 --> 47:29.450
A live war hero.

47:30.820 --> 47:32.440
Now I know how you did it.

47:33.790 --> 47:35.870
Hey, Curly, Gaye, anybody!

47:36.040 --> 47:37.040
Want a hero?

47:37.250 --> 47:38.790
Here's one for sale, cheap.

47:39.620 --> 47:41.240
All right, Rocco.

47:41.840 --> 47:42.840
All right!

47:43.750 --> 47:45.960
Let's you and me play that game now!

47:46.970 --> 47:49.300
You can stop me from going out that door.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.680
But you gotta die first.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.800
If he shoots me, you still get it.

47:56.100 --> 47:57.180
Get out of my way.

48:03.440 --> 48:04.650
Get away from that door!

48:31.130 --> 48:32.630
The gun wasn't loaded.

48:34.930 --> 48:36.430
He didn't have a chance.

48:38.350 --> 48:39.520
Murderer.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.050
Had to do it, old man.

48:43.020 --> 48:45.400
Or he would've been
out that door and gone.

48:45.690 --> 48:46.900
He's gone now.

48:48.110 --> 48:50.740
That's right, sister.
The gun wasn't loaded.

48:51.610 --> 48:53.190
But our hero didn't know it.

49:03.540 --> 49:06.090
You knew the gun was empty,
didn't you, son?

49:06.380 --> 49:08.210
You could tell by the weight.

49:08.380 --> 49:09.720
No, sir. I didn't know.

49:10.050 --> 49:11.510
He just didn't have the nerve, Pop.

49:11.880 --> 49:12.960
Let's face it.

49:13.130 --> 49:14.500
You were smart, fella.

49:14.720 --> 49:16.720
What happened to him
would've happened to you.

49:17.180 --> 49:19.560
It's better to be a live coward
than a dead hero.

49:20.560 --> 49:22.310
Oh, excuse me.

49:23.940 --> 49:26.270
You weren't afraid, son. We all know that.

49:26.440 --> 49:27.980
Oh, yes, I was afraid.

49:28.150 --> 49:29.860
But that's not why
I didn't pull the trigger.

49:30.070 --> 49:32.820
What do I care about Johnny Rocco,
whether he lives or dies?

49:32.990 --> 49:35.070
I only care about me. Me and mine!

49:35.700 --> 49:38.740
Rocco wants to come back to America,
let him. Let him be president!

49:38.910 --> 49:41.080
I fight nobody's battles but my own.

49:41.410 --> 49:43.450
I can't see it your way, Frank.

49:43.960 --> 49:45.580
Sawyer didn't either.

49:45.830 --> 49:46.910
He was a fool.

49:47.500 --> 49:50.090
Me, die to rid the world
of a Johnny Rocco?

49:51.550 --> 49:52.550
No, thanks.

49:52.840 --> 49:57.180
If I believed your way,
I'd want to be dead, too.

49:59.760 --> 50:00.920
It's true.

50:01.600 --> 50:02.770
You are a coward.

50:02.930 --> 50:05.930
What you're saying now is only
to save your coward's face.

50:06.100 --> 50:07.180
Now, Nora.

50:07.440 --> 50:09.110
Maybe Frank's right.

50:10.610 --> 50:11.940
Maybe he's right.

51:01.950 --> 51:03.330
Okay.

51:04.500 --> 51:06.000
Okay, okay.

51:07.210 --> 51:09.460
Hey, what's the idea, Ziggy?
Why ain't you started yet?

51:10.630 --> 51:11.920
So what?

51:12.340 --> 51:13.420
Huh?

51:13.630 --> 51:16.180
What's the matter, you guys?
Didn't I take chances?

51:16.670 --> 51:18.080
Now listen, I make the run from Cuba.

51:18.260 --> 51:22.180
I risk my neck, my boat and the shipment,
and you won't come out in the rain?

51:22.470 --> 51:25.520
Well, you listen to me. Either you
show tonight or the deal is off.

51:26.180 --> 51:27.970
Well, I know a dozen guys who'd just break
their necks

51:28.140 --> 51:29.680
to get their mitts on this shipment.

51:30.020 --> 51:33.030
Look, my watch says 8:00.

51:33.190 --> 51:35.780
I give you two hours.
You ain't here by 10:00, the deal is off.

51:37.070 --> 51:38.200
Hello?

51:38.910 --> 51:40.030
Hello?

51:40.200 --> 51:41.200
Hey!

51:44.330 --> 51:45.580
Oh!

51:57.590 --> 51:59.090
Downstairs, everybody.

52:30.420 --> 52:31.420
Hey.

52:32.420 --> 52:33.750
Didn't I say no drinking?

52:33.920 --> 52:36.340
Oh, please, honey. Just one?

52:51.440 --> 52:52.940
Bring down the shipment.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.610
In there.

53:10.290 --> 53:12.250
Mr. Temple.

53:12.710 --> 53:13.830
Wait.

53:14.290 --> 53:15.840
Is that someone calling?

53:16.790 --> 53:19.080
There were some Indians at the door.
I sent them away.

53:19.260 --> 53:20.420
You had no right.

53:21.470 --> 53:22.470
Oh...

53:28.140 --> 53:29.140
Listen to it.

53:29.310 --> 53:31.480
"The upstairs shutters gotta be closed,"
she said.

53:31.640 --> 53:33.140
If they ain't, the roof might come off.

53:33.310 --> 53:34.650
Go close them.

53:46.530 --> 53:49.080
One thing I can't stand
is a dame that's drunk.

53:50.370 --> 53:52.160
What I mean, they turn my stomach.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.460
No good to themselves or anybody else.

53:58.670 --> 54:00.050
She got the shakes, see?

54:00.550 --> 54:01.880
So she has a drink to get rid of them.

54:02.050 --> 54:03.680
That one tastes so good
so she has another one.

54:03.840 --> 54:05.840
First thing you know, she's stinko again.

54:06.180 --> 54:08.180
You gave me my first drink, Johnny.

54:08.350 --> 54:10.350
Oh, so it's all my fault now?

54:11.020 --> 54:13.020
Everybody has their first drink,
don't they?

54:13.180 --> 54:14.680
But everybody ain't a lush!

54:15.020 --> 54:17.770
If I'd known you was gonna act this way,
I wouldn't have come here.

54:18.360 --> 54:20.820
If I'd known what you're like,
you wouldn't have been asked.

54:23.360 --> 54:25.280
Eight years since I seen her.

54:30.410 --> 54:32.000
You wouldn't know it was the same dame.

54:33.370 --> 54:36.040
You certainly haven't changed one bit.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.340
Meaning what?

54:39.000 --> 54:40.210
Nothing.

54:41.300 --> 54:43.300
Gee, honey, you're as mean as can be.

54:44.550 --> 54:47.550
Mean as can be.
Now what does that remind me of?

54:47.760 --> 54:48.970
Well, don't you remember?

54:49.140 --> 54:51.220
That was in a song. She used to sing it.

54:51.390 --> 54:52.980
Yeah, that's right.

54:53.520 --> 54:56.100
I gave her her first chance, took her out
of the chorus, made her a singer.

54:56.310 --> 54:57.440
Mention that while you're at it.

54:57.600 --> 55:00.390
Why ain't you a singing star
instead of a lush?

55:00.770 --> 55:02.730
Gee, Johnny, I didn't mean anything.

55:02.940 --> 55:05.240
Yeah, she could've had a future.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.900
That's right. She had everything.

55:07.070 --> 55:08.950
Voice, looks.

55:09.320 --> 55:10.520
Plenty of class.

55:11.330 --> 55:12.700
I was the rage.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.080
Gee, honey.

55:17.830 --> 55:19.710
Now, look, Gaye.

55:20.790 --> 55:22.830
Why don't you give us your old song, hmm?

55:25.300 --> 55:27.890
- You mean, right now?
- Yeah.

55:30.430 --> 55:32.600
- I can't.
- Ah, sure you can.

55:33.100 --> 55:34.600
Please, Johnny, don't make me.

55:35.140 --> 55:36.770
I won't make you do anything.

55:39.060 --> 55:40.770
Tell you what,
I got a proposition for you.

55:41.360 --> 55:43.110
Now, you sing us your song,
you can have a drink.

55:47.200 --> 55:48.530
Can I have the drink first?

55:48.700 --> 55:50.120
No! The song.

55:50.280 --> 55:51.660
Then the drink.

55:54.950 --> 55:56.460
Without any accompaniment?

55:56.660 --> 55:58.790
Now, look, do you want a drink
or don't you?

56:04.250 --> 56:05.290
All right.

56:15.310 --> 56:16.430
Well?

56:16.810 --> 56:18.480
My gowns were gorgeous.

56:19.140 --> 56:21.680
Always low-cut. Very décolleté.

56:22.770 --> 56:24.690
I wore hardly any makeup.

56:25.270 --> 56:27.270
Just some lipstick, that's all.

56:27.820 --> 56:30.490
No lights, just a baby spot.

56:31.530 --> 56:32.950
I wouldn't have any entrance.

56:33.160 --> 56:34.660
They'd play the intro in the dark

56:34.910 --> 56:39.120
and a spot would come on and there I'd be.

56:50.840 --> 56:52.340
Well, go ahead. Sing.

58:33.490 --> 58:34.780
Oh.

58:34.950 --> 58:37.620
- Give me that drink now, Johnny.
- No.

58:40.120 --> 58:41.870
- Johnny.
- No!

58:42.160 --> 58:44.620
- But you promised.
- So what?

58:45.000 --> 58:47.580
- You said that...
- But you were rotten.

58:48.630 --> 58:49.960
Oh, no.

59:34.420 --> 59:35.720
Thanks, fella.

59:40.470 --> 59:41.720
You're welcome.

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:02.690
- Play a little gin?
- Okay.

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:04.240
- For how much?
- You name it.

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.700
Nickel a point.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.980
Hey, old man.

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:31.440
How bad can it get?

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.980
I asked you a question! Did you hear me?

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:40.200
Well, worst storm we ever had
was back in '35.

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:45.370
Wind whipped up a big wave and sent it
busting right over Matecumbe Key.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.330
Eight hundred people
were washed out to sea.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.210
How far away was that from here?

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.040
A few miles.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.640
Listen to it.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.910
I'm sorry about the things
I said upstairs.

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:25.230
I know they aren't true.
Will you forgive me, Frank?

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:26.620
Of course.

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:29.960
He might've killed you, but that made
no difference, you had to help her.

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:33.070
Your head said one way,
but your whole life said another.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.120
The other things, maybe they're true.
Maybe it is a rotten world.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.260
But a cause isn't lost as long as
someone's is willing to go on fighting.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.250
Well, I'm not that someone.

01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:45.010
But you are.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.640
You may not want to be,
but you can't help yourself.

01:01:47.810 --> 01:01:49.470
Your whole life's against you.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.310
What do you know about my life?

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.810
A whole lot.

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.400
From the way you look and talk,
and from things George wrote me.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.700
Most of his last letter was
all about you and him on the phone.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.660
Only he had it the other way.
You were the one on the hill.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.250
What's the matter with you?

01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:58.870
Nothing.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.470
Why is everybody so quiet?

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:06.510
Come on, talk, why don't you?

01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:08.470
Well?

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:10.310
You, Curly, say something.

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:13.340
- What do you want me to say?
- Oh, anything, just so it's talk.

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:16.260
- Go ahead!
- I'm trying to think.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.320
I bet you two or three years,
we get Prohibition back.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.530
Go on.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.110
- This time we make it stick.
- Yeah.

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.480
I bet you two or three years,
Prohibition comes back.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.270
Absolutely, yeah.

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:34.330
The trouble was, see before, I mean,
too many guys wanted to be top dog.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:36.790
That was the trouble, yeah.

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:39.710
One mob gets to massacring another.

01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:42.380
The papers play it up big. Big, see?

01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:44.300
- So what happens?
- So what?

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:46.420
Naturally, the papers play it up big,

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:49.430
and the public, they get the idea
that Prohibition's no good.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:52.810
That if they can get rid of it.

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.270
- Prohibition, I mean...
- I don't believe it.

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:58.300
Eight hundred guys getting washed
out to sea. You're a liar!

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.400
Nobody would live here
after a thing like that happened.

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:01.650
Would they, Curly?

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.820
I remember reading about it
in the papers at the time.

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.780
A relief train was dispatched from Miami.

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:10.320
The barometer was down to about 26 inches

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:13.450
when that train pulled into Homestead.

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.500
Engineer backed his string
of empty coaches

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.460
into the danger zone
and the hurricane hit.

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:23.920
Knocked those coaches right off the track.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:28.430
200 miles an hour, that wind blew.

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:34.390
A tidal wave, 12 feet high
went right across the Key.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.470
Whole towns were wiped out.

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:41.140
Miles and miles of track
were ripped up and washed away.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.560
Nothing was left.

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:47.430
More than 500 bodies were
recovered after the storm.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.160
And for months afterwards,

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:53.700
corpses were found in the mangrove swamps.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.080
You don't like it, do you, Rocco?
The storm?

01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:03.410
Show it your gun, why don't you?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.340
If it doesn't stop, shoot it.

01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:13.550
So the public votes out Prohibition.

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:15.850
And that's the end of the mobs.

01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:17.960
Next time, it'll be different, though.

01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:19.940
We learned our lesson, all right.

01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:22.900
Next time, the mobs'll get together.

01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:28.180
Make a big wave.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.690
Send it crashing down on us.

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.070
Destroy us all, if need be.
But punish him.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.480
Oh, shut up, old man!
I'm warning you, shut up!

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:38.410
Hear me. Hear me.

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:39.790
- I'll kill you!
- Rocco!

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:41.150
Make a big wave.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:45.000
Send it against us. Take us all.
But destroy him.

01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:46.630
Rocco.

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.320
Mr. Temple!

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:10.630
Mr. Temple!

01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:05.100
The storm's passing.

01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.400
A torn shutter or two,
some trash on the beach.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.980
In a few hours, there'll be little
to remind you of what happened tonight.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.029
Will we ever see you again, Frank?

01:08:17.529 --> 01:08:19.029
Yeah, the storm.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:21.160
It's passing.

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:24.700
- Will we?
- I hope so.

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:26.870
Why don't you stay right on
here with us, Frank?

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.460
You're most welcome.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:30.920
Go on, tell him, Nora.

01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:34.540
If he decides to stay here with us,
we'd be most happy.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.340
Go on, tell Frank.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.050
Have you any folks?

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.300
No.

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:44.600
I'd be proud to have you
regard us as your family.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.020
Maybe that isn't what Frank wants.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.470
Oh, I don't mean to set onto you, son.

01:08:50.729 --> 01:08:53.189
Think it over.
Don't give your answer right away.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.149
Hey, boss! Hey, hey, boss!

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:57.029
- What's the matter?
- The boat's gone!

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:58.529
What?

01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:10.000
He did it.

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.630
I told him I'd kill him,
but he did it just the same.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.040
Maybe he'll come back
now the storm's over.

01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:16.210
- No.
- Why not?

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.760
Because he believed me
when I told him I'd kill him.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.920
Well, what are we gonna do?

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:20.430
- We can't stay here!
- Can we?

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:26.550
Hey, boss?

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:34.609
Your mistake, sister.

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:36.819
- We're not in any trouble.
- Got something?

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:41.779
There's another boat out there.
It ain't much, but it'll get us to Cuba.

01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:43.279
Who's going to run it?

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:49.870
Him.

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:54.780
Mr. Temple! You not good man!
You not let nobody in! That's no good!

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.090
Tom Osceola.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:57.920
- Tom, Tom...
- Oh, shut up!

01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:00.300
You leave women and baby out here
in storm? That no good!

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:03.000
You no more friend, my brother and me.
We no do like you say anymore!

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:05.510
No go Ben Wade!
You no good friend to Indian!

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.470
Tom, Tom!

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:11.310
You told me you sent them away.
You lied to me.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.150
They were outside
my door during the whole storm.

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.360
- So what?
- Well, they might've died out there.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.940
And who cares?

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:19.650
You filth.

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.650
What he said, you can run a boat.
That's a fact, huh?

01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:25.160
His first sweetheart was a boat.

01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:27.870
You're taking us to Cuba.

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.120
Why should I?

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.860
Because you know
what'll happen to you if you don't.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.250
I won't take you.

01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:35.290
You mean, you'd rather die than take us?

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.210
- I didn't say that.
- Hmm?

01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:40.800
You won't kill me because I'm your
only chance of getting away from here.

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:44.720
There's other ways of getting at you.
Right, Toots?

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:45.970
Right.

01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:48.630
- Maybe I'm up to them.
- Oh, no, you wouldn't be.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:52.730
After a few minutes of Toots, here, you'll
begin to ask yourself questions like,

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.310
"What if I come out of this a cripple?"

01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:00.020
And uh, "Do I care whether they make
their getaway or don't?"

01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:02.530
All your answers would be right ones.

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:05.030
- I'm not so sure.
- I am.

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:07.490
Of course, if you're anxious
and want to find out

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.870
just how good you are at taking it,
we'll accommodate you.

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:12.580
But let me warn you.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.620
Toots hasn't had much practice.

01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:16.540
Kind of rusty. Might slip.

01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:18.700
And that'd be too bad.

01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:22.250
Because you made real sense
upstairs when you said that, uh,

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.720
"One Rocco more or less
ain't worth dying for."

01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:30.260
Ziggy!

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.720
Yeah.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.520
Mr. Temple!

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:38.730
Mr. Temple!

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.150
The law.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.240
One wrong word out of anybody
and he gets it the same as Sawyer did.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.700
Temple!

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.280
Understand me, old man?

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:48.780
Temple!

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.490
Now, you, sister, let him in.

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:57.250
Hey, Temple!

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:07.720
Good evening, Ms. Temple.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.130
I'm looking for Sawyer. Is he here?

01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:11.510
No.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.260
Has he been here?

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.600
No.

01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:17.850
That's funny. He put a call into me
from here about 7:00.

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.600
- Did he?
- Yeah.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.610
- Good evening, Temple. Folks.
- Ben.

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:24.600
- Pretty good blow, huh?
- Yeah.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.940
Did some damage, I see.

01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:29.610
Power lines are down
in a couple of places.

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:32.080
- How's the road?
- Passable.

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.120
I'm trying to locate Sawyer.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.780
Seen him, anybody?

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:46.090
Have you seen Sawyer?

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.460
No.

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:51.390
Well, he was here, I know
because he called me from here.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.970
About 7:00.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.350
I called back a few minutes later.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.060
Somebody answered. Was it one of you?

01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:00.400
I did.

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:02.270
Oh, you?

01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:05.260
I just come down from upstairs
when you called.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.570
There was nobody around, so I answered.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.070
Probably he stopped in to make his call.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.490
Then he went on and got caught
in the storm.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.740
He's stalled someplace along the road
right now, probably.

01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:17.830
Well, he ain't between here
and Palm Grove.

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.750
And he wouldn't have called me
unless it was something special.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.540
Seen anything of the Osceola brothers?

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.090
- Have you?
- No.

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:30.080
I figured that was what was all about.
His call, I mean.

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:31.590
The Osceola brothers.

01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:34.640
Couple of Indians busted out of jail,
and we're looking for them.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.800
Oh.

01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:38.100
I'll take a run down Matecumbe Way.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:41.100
If Sawyer shows up, tell him to wait.
I'll be back.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.690
See you later.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.280
First visit to the Keys, Mr...

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.100
- Brown.
- Yeah.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.910
Late in the season for a storm like this.

01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:54.620
They usually hit the early part
of the summer.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:55.780
Oh, is that so?

01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:57.700
- Been doing any fishing?
- Yeah.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.410
Well, there's no better fishing
anywhere than on the Keys.

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:02.290
See you later.

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.340
It's him!

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.690
Sawyer!

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:08.270
He's murdered!

01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:11.110
Well, look, I didn't wanna say anything.
After all, it's not my business.

01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:14.100
But those Indians you were
talking about, they were here.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.450
The Osceolas?

01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:18.910
Yeah, they were here all during the storm.
They left only a couple of minutes ago.

01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:51.060
Stop!

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.030
Stop or I'll shoot!

01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:58.990
Watch yourselves. Stay in line.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.930
He's dead.

01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:22.510
Your Indians murdered Sawyer.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.470
You lied to me, Temple.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.390
You said you hadn't seen the Osceolas.
You lied, didn't you?

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.010
I knew Sawyer had been here.
That's why he called me.

01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:32.690
Because he'd found the Osceolas.

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.610
They thought they could hide it
by sinking his body,

01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:37.520
but they couldn't. The storm tore
his body loose and threw it up.

01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:39.490
Right at your door.

01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:42.910
And that's where the crime belongs,
at your door.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:47.500
You probably knew they killed Sawyer.
I wouldn't put it past you!

01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:50.370
And I'm gonna lay charges
naming you as accessory.

01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:52.540
What was the shooting?

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.420
The Osceolas, they tried to get away.

01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:56.510
I killed them both.

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:14.900
Brown, what's your first name?

01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:17.070
Howard.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.480
Address?

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.410
Hotel Central, Milwaukee.

01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:27.150
- How long you gonna be here?
- A week.

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.580
Haven't I seen you someplace before?

01:17:33.210 --> 01:17:34.590
I don't think so.

01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:36.990
You.

01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:40.260
Hoff. Richard.

01:17:41.970 --> 01:17:44.140
Hotel Central, Milwaukee.

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.310
We're all together.

01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:48.680
Your full name.

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:51.510
Frank McCloud. No address.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.850
What are you doing here?

01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.650
Passing through.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.030
You.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.110
Bass. Edward Bass.
Hotel Central, Milwaukee.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.440
We're all together.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.870
How far to Key West?

01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:14.250
How far to Key West?

01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:16.460
About 100 miles.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.090
Some hurricane.

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:20.420
Thought it would blow us
right out into the ocean.

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:24.010
Had to pull up on the road for
a couple of hours till it blew over.

01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:26.250
That's some hurricane.

01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:28.350
I'll be back in the morning.

01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:31.180
Can we get something to eat?

01:18:32.230 --> 01:18:33.440
Can we?

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.500
In there, everybody.

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:17.350
Hi, Ziggy!

01:19:17.850 --> 01:19:19.680
Johnny-boy, how are you?

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:22.360
Well, well, well. What do you know?

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.200
You're a sight for sore eyes!

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:26.860
Come on in.

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:29.980
Hey, boys. Ziggy!

01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:33.040
It's sure great to see you again,
Johnny pal.

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:35.200
Well, it sure is swell.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.130
Hey, Rocco. You put on a little weight.

01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:42.300
Well, now wait a minute.
Look who's talking!

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.550
Oh, look out!

01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:48.590
- Say, guess who's here?
- Who?

01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:50.590
Gaye!

01:19:50.890 --> 01:19:51.890
Gaye, where are you?

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:53.640
Gaye Dawn? Don't tell me!

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.390
Well, I'll be...

01:19:58.730 --> 01:20:02.440
- Say, she's as pretty as ever.
- Yeah.

01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:08.020
Where you been all the time
Johnny was away, huh?

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.490
Around.

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:12.200
If I'd have known that, I'd have
tried to beat Johnny's time.

01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:14.660
Same old Ziggy, huh?

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.120
All right, baby.

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.340
I know you fellas are in a hurry, huh?

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:22.500
Yeah.

01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:24.210
Oh, uh, Curly.

01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:39.430
Lou.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.030
Paper has a good feel.

01:21:03.670 --> 01:21:05.170
Lathe work's okay.

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:09.170
Portrait's good. No breaks in the lines.

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:11.680
- Serial numbers check out?
- Yeah, naturally.

01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:21.310
Back color's okay.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.230
High-class merchandise.

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:27.190
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:51.050
Hey, fella, what are you gonna do?

01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:54.140
Don't go with them.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.890
They'd wait till you get them
inside of Cuba, then they'd kill you.

01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.890
You'd never walk off that boat.

01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:02.770
She's right, Frank.
Tell them you'll go, or they'll hurt you.

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:06.270
Then when you get outside in the dark,
make a break, run. Try to get away.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.110
It's your only chance, fella.

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.610
Frank, what are you thinking?

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.620
You were right.

01:22:15.490 --> 01:22:19.410
Your head says one thing
and your whole life says another.

01:22:20.290 --> 01:22:22.210
Your head always loses.

01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:26.000
Out there in the dark,
make a break for it.

01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:27.540
Run, fella!

01:22:28.090 --> 01:22:31.050
Yeah, that's what my head says.

01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:32.920
You gonna make a fight of it, Frank?

01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:34.720
I've got to.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.800
Not that one Rocco more or less makes
any difference in this world.

01:22:38.890 --> 01:22:40.770
What I said upstairs still goes.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.520
I haven't changed my tune.

01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:46.980
It's just that I've got to.

01:22:47.150 --> 01:22:50.900
Well, if you're a fighter,
you can't walk away from a fight.

01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:52.740
That's the answer, I guess.

01:22:56.530 --> 01:22:58.160
Here you are, Curly.

01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:00.040
Well, Johnny pal.

01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:01.790
When are you coming back again?

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.080
It won't be long now.

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:06.080
With you back again,
it'll be like old times, huh?

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:12.210
- You know something?
- Yeah?

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.550
I bet inside of two years
we have Prohibition back again.

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.970
- Only this time, it's gonna be different.
- Right.

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.640
- The mobs will be together.
- Yeah.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.920
- No more blasting each other.
- You said it.

01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:27.690
- So long, Johnny pal.
- So long, Ziggy.

01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:29.970
- Yeah. Yeah.
- See you when.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.240
Let's get started.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:47.330
Bring everything down.
The soldier's stuff, too.

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.710
Oh, soldier?

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.750
Give Ralph a hand.

01:23:51.630 --> 01:23:52.800
Coming with us?

01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:54.720
Yes or no? I'm in a hurry.

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:56.880
Toots, go to work on him.

01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:01.090
You win.

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:03.640
I thought you'd change your mind
the last minute.

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.690
Well, what's the damage, old man?

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:09.860
That ought to take care of it.

01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:13.070
Want to come along, sister?

01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:19.160
All right.

01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:40.550
Okay, boys.

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:52.900
Give me.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.450
Where are my things?

01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:02.690
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
You're not coming.

01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:05.650
Here, on this, you can
stay drunk for a month.

01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:07.540
- Johnny, please take me with you.
- Let go.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:10.740
- Get away!
- You got to, Johnny. You got to, please!

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.380
- Come on.
- I'll stop drinking. I'll do anything.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.710
Only take me with you.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.210
- Please, Johnny. I love you! I need you!
- Let go of me, will you?

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:19.800
I'll kill myself, I will! Johnny, please!
Please!

01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:22.430
Listen, I'll be good to you,
like I was before.

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.220
I won't let you go without me!
You've got to take me with you!

01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:27.850
- You've got to, you've got to!
- Get away from me!

01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.390
Come on, soldier!

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.480
Get going, soldier.

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.200
Good luck, son.

01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:47.160
Yeah, good luck.

01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:08.390
Why doesn't he run?

01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:10.350
Run, fella, run!

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.610
Why doesn't he run?

01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.660
Will you cast off that bowline?

01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:12.500
Stand by that stern line.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.870
Okay, let her go.

01:27:58.710 --> 01:28:00.590
That was his only chance.

01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:02.880
He didn't take it.

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.870
He should've run.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.220
The lines are dead.

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.620
How we doing?

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.590
We're right on course.

01:28:48.970 --> 01:28:50.760
Well, keep us that way.

01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:01.360
How you feeling, Toots?

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.770
Oh, I feel awful.

01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:05.440
Why don't you go downstairs?

01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:07.180
It's too hot down there.

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:10.110
What time is it?

01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:13.410
A little after four.

01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.290
We're not halfway there, yet.

01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:18.040
- Johnny's sleeping?
- Yeah.

01:29:41.890 --> 01:29:43.760
Dog, Unit, Man, Roger.

01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:48.030
Numeral 0-2-2-4-0-0-Z.

01:29:48.570 --> 01:29:50.150
Man, Roger, X-ray, George.

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.410
Group numerals 4-5.

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:57.160
Missing fishing boat Santana
is being taken to Cuba. X-ray.

01:29:57.490 --> 01:30:00.240
Sea search of area B immediately. X-ray.

01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:02.410
Is us they are talking about on the radio?

01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:04.080
Oh, let them.

01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:07.450
In a fog like this, they couldn't find
the Queen Mary.

01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:10.370
Hey, Curly!

01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:15.180
What time is it?

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:18.010
- A little after four.
- Oh.

01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:20.480
- Say, Johnny.
- Yeah.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:23.010
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.860
- About Gaye.
- What about her?

01:30:26.110 --> 01:30:28.320
Do you think it was such a good idea
not to bring her?

01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:31.980
- She's pretty sore.
- Oh, so she's sore.

01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:34.070
Yeah, but she might squeal.

01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:36.410
Just for spite.

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:38.240
On Ziggy, I mean.

01:30:40.450 --> 01:30:41.530
Well?

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.880
Oh.

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.170
I get it.

01:30:47.710 --> 01:30:49.460
There's only one Johnny.

01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:19.160
Hey, you.

01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:22.410
Take a look over the stern.
See if we picked up any kelp.

01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:31.920
Oh.

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:33.760
I feel awful.

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.650
Toots, help!

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:23.300
Curly?

01:32:24.850 --> 01:32:26.180
What's the matter?

01:32:29.650 --> 01:32:30.980
Curly?

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:37.980
My gun. It's gone.

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.030
Gaye.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.080
Toots.

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:52.380
Ralph.

01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:55.630
Soldier.

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:57.470
Hey there, soldier!

01:32:58.420 --> 01:32:59.460
Soldier?

01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:07.680
Curly.

01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:12.150
- Angel, you go up.
- Huh?

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.650
Go on! Do you hear me?

01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:15.820
I'll get killed.

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:17.930
You gonna go up there? Are you?

01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:20.860
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Toots killed him, he's dead.

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.030
Then you go check.

01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:32.380
Soldier.

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.000
Listen to me.

01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:36.250
Angel and Curly are dead.

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.080
There's just me and you.

01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:40.760
From now on, we'll be partners.
Everything will be 50-50.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.130
What do you say?

01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:44.550
Can you hear me?

01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:47.140
What do you say? Is it a deal?

01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:52.730
I know what you're thinking.

01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:55.480
You get rid of me and have all
the money for yourself, is that it?

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:56.980
Is it?

01:33:57.230 --> 01:33:58.280
Answer me!

01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:03.280
I'll tell you what.

01:34:04.410 --> 01:34:06.080
Suppose I say the money is yours.

01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:08.500
Yeah!

01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:12.750
Here, look!

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:16.500
It's yours.

01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:18.120
All yours, soldier.

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:19.960
Plenty more when we get to Cuba.

01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:22.750
Okay, soldier?

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.000
You hear me?

01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:26.810
I'll make you rich!

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.600
Soldier!

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.770
Soldier!

01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:37.320
You're not big enough to do this to Rocco.
I'll kill you!

01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:39.530
You'll never bring me in. Never!

01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:45.450
Look, soldier, I know what it is.

01:34:46.570 --> 01:34:49.650
You figure I got a gun,
so you can't trust me. Right?

01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:52.150
Okay.

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.210
Look!

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.010
See?

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:03.750
I'm leveling with you.

01:35:04.630 --> 01:35:05.960
Okay, soldier?

01:35:06.970 --> 01:35:07.970
I'm coming out.

01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:11.550
Okay, soldier?

01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:16.150
I got no gun and I'm coming out.

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.770
Soldier!

01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:54.580
Mayday. Mayday.

01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:56.250
Mayday.

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.290
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.

01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:02.340
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.

01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:05.250
This is Abel, Sugar, Abel, Nan.
Abel, Sugar, Abel, Nan.

01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:08.090
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.
Calling Nan, Mike, Abel.

01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:09.680
Come in, please.

01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:13.350
This is Nan, Mike, Abel.
This is Nan, Mike, Abel. Go ahead.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.270
This is Abel, Sugar, Abel, Nan.

01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:18.560
The Santana.

01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:21.060
My name is Frank McCloud.

01:37:21.850 --> 01:37:25.600
I'm about 12 miles off
Boot Key Harbor, on my way in.

01:37:26.190 --> 01:37:27.190
Over.

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:30.060
Are you all right?
Are you all right? Over.

01:37:31.110 --> 01:37:34.690
Yes, but I need medical attention. Over.

01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:36.950
Continue on course.

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:38.650
Stand by on this frequency.

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.290
I'm standing by.

01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:46.460
Will you put me through to
the Largo Hotel?

01:37:47.170 --> 01:37:48.340
Stand by.

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.220
State police picked up that fellow Ziggy
and his men crossing into Georgia.

01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:56.600
You'll have to go up
and identify 'em, miss.

01:37:59.810 --> 01:38:01.190
Mr. Temple.

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:03.770
I'm mighty grateful to you
for saving my life and all

01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:07.070
but those two boys, the Osceolas.

01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:10.640
I'd rather been killed than have
innocent blood on my hands.

01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:13.320
Oh, I'm the one to blame.

01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:16.030
If they hadn't trusted me,
they wouldn't have turned up here

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.040
and they'd still be alive.

01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:21.330
It seems we can't do anything
but harm to those people

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.250
even when we go to help them.

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.630
No, Mr. Temple, it wasn't you.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.050
It wasn't the law or anybody.

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:30.130
It was only Johnny Rocco.

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:33.090
Nobody in the whole world is safe
as long as he's alive.

01:38:35.890 --> 01:38:37.600
We better go, miss.

01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:57.700
Hotel Largo.

01:38:59.950 --> 01:39:01.040
Frank.

01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.880
Oh, thank God.

01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:35.650
He's all right, Dad.
He's coming back to us.
