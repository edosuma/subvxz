WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.253
Hey.

00:06.423 --> 00:07.506
Six dollars, please.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.217
Six? I just had it for one night. It's 3.

00:10.385 --> 00:14.054
Eight o'clock is the cutoff.
And, oh, it's 8:02.

00:15.724 --> 00:18.434
You know, in a weird way,
you have too much power.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.646
Look, you're gonna have to help me
out here because I only have 3.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.857
I can help with that.

00:25.775 --> 00:29.028
Oh, my God. Richard?

00:29.696 --> 00:31.613
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.366
Wow. Your lip went bald.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.578
Thanks.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.457
So you look great.

00:41.624 --> 00:42.708
Yeah, right. Ha, ha.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.002
No, you do. You...

00:45.170 --> 00:47.421
- You just... You...
- What?

00:47.672 --> 00:49.882
You got panties stuck to your leg.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.930
Ahem, that's because I was just grabbing
some things out of the dryer...

00:57.098 --> 00:59.224
...and static cling. Ha, ha.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.810
Or maybe it's just because God knew
I'd be running into you...

01:01.978 --> 01:03.687
...and saw an opportunity.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.856
It's good to see you.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.983
It's good to see you too.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.705
- See that guy? He's in "Classics" now...
- Who?

02:03.873 --> 02:07.251
...but you know as soon as we leave,
he's going straight to the porn.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.544
He's gonna go up to the counter
with Citizen Kane...

02:09.711 --> 02:12.172
...Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.
- Ha, ha.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.928
This is nice.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.888
- Ha, ha. Yeah.
- I miss this.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.431
Me too.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.392
So you wanna get a hamburger
or something?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.727
Aw, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.730
No. Just friends. I won't grope you.
I promise.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.567
Yeah, I think it's too soon.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.528
No, it's not too soon. I had lunch at 11.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.992
Yeah, baby.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.453
- What are you doing?
- Making chocolate milk. You want some?

02:43.621 --> 02:45.164
No, thanks. I'm 29.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.500
Oh, my God. I gotta go to work.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.003
What time do you think
you're gonna get off tonight?

02:51.171 --> 02:52.921
I don't know, honey.
It could be really late.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.673
Oh, come on. Not again.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.718
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.
Listen, I'll make a deal with you, okay?

02:57.886 --> 02:59.469
- Mm.
- Every night that you're asleep...

02:59.637 --> 03:01.263
...before I get home from work...
- Yeah.

03:01.431 --> 03:05.350
...I will wake you up in a way
that has proved very popular in the past.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.312
Well, now, if you need to stay late,
I want to be supportive of that.

03:08.479 --> 03:09.688
Thank you.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.607
- Hi.
- Hey, Pheebs.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.066
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.694
Look at you.
Since when do you Rollerblade?

03:15.862 --> 03:18.071
Oh. Since tomorrow.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.282
I met this really cute guy in the park.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.952
And he, like, you know, jogs and blades
and swims, and so we made a deal.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.831
He's gonna teach me how
to do all sorts ofjock stuff.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.500
- And what are you gonna do for him?
- I'm gonna let him.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.336
- Okay.
- Cool.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.630
- Morning.
- Hey.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.049
- Somebody got in late last night.
- Ahem.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.384
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

03:40.762 --> 03:44.139
- When did this happen?
- Oh, um, around 8:02.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.017
And we, uh, talked for a little while...

03:47.185 --> 03:49.811
...and then, um, we went out
for an innocent burger.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.564
Oh, there's no such thing
as an innocent burger.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.484
- Are you gonna see him again?
- Tomorrow night.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.527
Monica, what are you doing?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.988
Well, she spent the last six months
getting over him...

04:00.156 --> 04:04.785
...and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.247
It's not a date, okay?

04:08.414 --> 04:11.708
I'm just gonna teach him how to make
a lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.503
Well, you might want to make a little extra
because, you know...

04:14.671 --> 04:17.047
- ...you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
- Mm.

04:18.173 --> 04:20.175
We're not gonna have sex.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.177
Okay? Nothing's changed here.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.680
He still doesn't want children,
and I still do.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.765
So that's why we're gonna
just be friends.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.642
Naked friends.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.649
- Hey. Do you have any ice?
- Hey.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.067
Check the freezer.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.695
If there's none in there,
we're probably out.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.155
Are you just getting home from work?
It's late.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.658
Yeah, I know.
I had the greatest day, though.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.327
I got to sit in on a meeting
with the reps from Calvin Klein.

04:48.037 --> 04:51.540
I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie,
she ordered a ton of it.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.874
How was your day?

04:53.042 --> 04:56.253
I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth
using just my tongue.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.381
Hmm.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.841
Um...

05:01.426 --> 05:04.553
Why do you have a copy of The Shining
in your freezer?

05:04.721 --> 05:08.557
Oh. I was reading it last night
and I got scared, so...

05:10.560 --> 05:13.228
But, uh, you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

05:13.396 --> 05:15.605
Well, safer.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.399
I never start reading The Shining...

05:17.567 --> 05:20.152
...without making sure
we got plenty of room in the freezer.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.403
- You know?
- Ha, ha.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.739
How often do you read it?

05:23.948 --> 05:26.533
Haven't you ever read the same book
over and over again?

05:26.701 --> 05:29.578
Well, um, I guess I read Little Women
more than once.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.039
But that's a classic.
What's so great about The Shining?

05:32.206 --> 05:35.876
The question should be, Rach,
"What is not so great about The Shining?"

05:37.253 --> 05:40.922
Okay? And the answer would be, "Nothing."
All right?

05:41.090 --> 05:42.883
This is, like, the scariest book ever.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.802
I bet it's way better
than that classic of yours.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.096
- Ha, ha.
- Okay.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.432
Uh, well, we'll just see about that, okay?

05:50.600 --> 05:56.313
I will read The Shining,
and you will read Little Women.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.981
- All right, you got it.
- All right?

05:58.149 --> 05:59.191
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.652
- Uh, now, Rach, these little women...
- Yeah.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.238
How little are they?

06:05.531 --> 06:08.408
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

06:14.123 --> 06:17.959
- Um, Chandler, Ross? This is Robert.
- Oh, hey.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.253
- Hi.
- You have lipstick right here.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.130
- Oh.
- Huh. That's okay, it's mine.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.840
We just kissed.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.302
So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

06:27.470 --> 06:30.013
Well, I'm from California.

06:30.264 --> 06:33.683
Right, right. Sometimes you guys
just burst into flame.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.823
I'm up. Ahem. I'm up. I've gotten up now.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.908
Anybody, uh, want anything?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.410
- I'll have coffee.
- Yeah, me too.

06:51.577 --> 06:55.080
- Yeah, make that three.
- Okay. Ross, why don't you come with me?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.167
Okay. Ha, ha.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.504
What is the matter with you?
What's going on?

07:02.672 --> 07:04.673
Robert's coming out.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.967
What do you mean? What, is he gay?

07:09.011 --> 07:10.387
No, he...

07:13.099 --> 07:15.434
He's coming out of his shorts.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.688
What?

07:19.981 --> 07:22.524
The man is showing brain.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.489
Are you sure? Hold on.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.201
Ahem. I'm sorry, you guys.
That was a coffee and a...

07:33.369 --> 07:35.203
- Coffee. We could write it down.
- Okay.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.331
No, no. That won't be, uh...
Won't be necessary.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.549
- Well?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.759
What do we do? What do we do?

07:49.927 --> 07:55.140
Well, I suppose we just
try to not look directly at it.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.560
Like an eclipse.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.734
When people compliment me
on my cooking tonight, what do I say?

08:05.902 --> 08:09.779
Well, you say, "Thank you very much."
And then you buy me something pretty.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.741
Come on, we're gonna
put our hands in this bowl...

08:12.909 --> 08:15.952
...and we're gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.706
Ooh, this feels very weird.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.959
Heh. You touch people's eyeballs every day
and this feels weird?

08:23.127 --> 08:25.253
Yeah, well, sure, I touch them.

08:25.421 --> 08:28.131
But I spent years
learning not to squish them.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.889
That's my hand.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.890
Oh.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.519
- Okay.
- Gotta keep squishing.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.020
The tomatoes are squishing.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.481
- Oh, yeah. Oh.
- Oh.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.067
Oh, gosh. You got some on your shirt.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.443
- Yeah.
- Hold on a second.

08:48.611 --> 08:53.406
Okay, just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.825
It should, um, do...

08:57.245 --> 08:58.745
...the trick.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.256
What?

09:09.423 --> 09:11.633
Um, you've got some on your pants.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.472
I'll just throw them out.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.313
These little women.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.357
Wow.

09:28.526 --> 09:29.609
You're liking it, huh?

09:29.777 --> 09:33.321
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.657
I don't see how
he could ever forgive her.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.871
Um, Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.208
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

09:47.461 --> 09:48.837
Oh.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.008
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

09:53.175 --> 09:55.760
Because that is the one thing missing
from The Shining.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.849
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.353
No wonder Rachel had to read this
so many times.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.024
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.109
Hey, how'd the, uh, basketball go?

10:11.277 --> 10:16.281
Oh, okay. I learned how to shoot a lay-up,
a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

10:16.532 --> 10:17.949
You mean a 3-pointer?

10:18.117 --> 10:20.619
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.706
So, um, is there a phone here
I can check my messages?

10:24.874 --> 10:29.044
- Yeah, in the back. Do you want a quarter?
- Oh, no. I always carry one in my sock.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.059
What are you doing?
Get back over on your side of the...

10:44.226 --> 10:45.852
Hello.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.525
- Hi. I'm Joey. We haven't met.
- Hi.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.611
- Uh, good to meet you. Robert.
- Okay.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.699
What?

11:00.368 --> 11:03.703
What? You guys, what is going on?

11:03.913 --> 11:05.664
Do you not like Robert?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.124
Why are you laughing?

11:08.376 --> 11:10.335
Calm down. No reason to get testy.

11:15.966 --> 11:18.677
- You guys. Come on.
- We're sorry.

11:19.178 --> 11:24.641
It just seems that Robert isn't
as concealed in the shorts area...

11:24.809 --> 11:26.267
...as, uh, one may have hoped.

11:27.561 --> 11:28.937
How do you mean?

11:29.105 --> 11:31.398
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:32.024 --> 11:36.861
Uh, Robert? Could you, uh,
pass me those cookies?

11:37.279 --> 11:38.697
Sure.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.079
So how'd the lasagna go over?

11:46.706 --> 11:50.667
Really? Good.
So you owe me three pretty things.

11:51.961 --> 11:55.130
Yeah. I've been thinking about you too.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.467
Well, no. It's hard, this platonomy thing.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.970
What...? It's a word.

12:05.141 --> 12:09.561
Yeah. I do think it's better this way.
Yeah, we're being smart.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.771
Yes, I'm sure.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.942
You really sure?

12:17.361 --> 12:18.486
I'll call you back.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.916
So we can be friends
who sleep together.

12:32.334 --> 12:35.462
Absolutely.
This'll just be something we do.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.964
Like racquetball.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.593
Yeah. Sounds smart and healthy to me.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.347
So, um, just out of, uh, curiosity...

12:46.515 --> 12:50.810
...um, do you currently have
any other racquetball buddies?

12:51.812 --> 12:52.937
Just your dad.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.276
Although that's actually racquetball.

12:58.444 --> 13:02.113
You know, I do have a blind date...

13:02.281 --> 13:05.366
...with my sister's neighbor
next Tuesday.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.038
Do you want me to cancel it?

13:10.581 --> 13:11.706
No.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.084
- No.
- Yeah.

13:15.252 --> 13:19.172
Because if you did,
that means you'd be canceling for me.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.051
- And we're just friends.
- Exactly.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.679
Hey.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.723
Hey. Oh, don't sit down.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.600
- Ready to go to the batting cage?
- You bet.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.894
And first, here's a gift. Ha, ha.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.939
Oh, wow.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.567
- Hey.
- Stretchy pants?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.903
Well, those are the greatest things
in the world.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.614
If I were you, I'd wear them every day,
every day.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.910
Jeez, thank you. Really, that's so nice.

13:49.078 --> 13:53.456
But, um, to be honest,
I don't think I can wear these.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.876
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.129
I'm sorry.

14:00.297 --> 14:03.007
That's all right. I'll figure...

14:05.094 --> 14:07.637
- Hey.
- How you doing?

14:07.805 --> 14:09.639
- How's it going?
- Good.

14:09.807 --> 14:10.849
- Good.
- Hey, Rach?

14:11.016 --> 14:14.727
- How you doing with The Shining?
- Uh, Danny just went into Room 217.

14:14.895 --> 14:18.606
Ooh. The next part's the best.
When that dead lady in the bathtub...

14:18.774 --> 14:21.192
No, no, no. Come on.
You're gonna ruin it.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.736
All right, I'll talk in code.

14:23.904 --> 14:27.282
Remember when the kid sees
those two blanks in the hallway?

14:28.158 --> 14:29.868
- Yeah, that's very cool.
- Yeah.

14:30.035 --> 14:34.622
Ooh. All blank and no blank
makes blank a blank-blank, right?

14:36.667 --> 14:38.293
Oh, no, no. No, the end.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.587
When Jack almost kills them all
with that blank...

14:40.754 --> 14:43.423
...but then in the last second
they get away. Aw.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.676
Joey, I can't believe you just did that.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.512
I can't believe she cracked your code.

14:54.476 --> 14:58.187
All right, okay. Laurie proposes to Jo
and she says no...

14:58.355 --> 15:02.650
...even though she's still in love with him.
And then he ends up marrying Amy.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.612
Hey.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.156
Mine was by accident.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.532
All right.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.202
The boiler explodes and destroys
the hotel and kills the dad.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.372
Beth dies.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.884
Beth...? Beth dies?

15:28.052 --> 15:29.093
Mm-hm.

15:29.261 --> 15:33.097
Is that true?
If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

15:33.474 --> 15:36.768
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

15:36.936 --> 15:39.228
- What?
- Joey's asking if you've just ruined...

15:39.396 --> 15:42.774
...the first book he's ever loved
that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.572
No. She doesn't die.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.616
Then why would you say that?

15:55.621 --> 15:59.540
Because I wanted to hurt you.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.962
Oh, there they are. I dropped my keys.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.341
Got them.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.389
Hi.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.433
Sorry. I'm sorry.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.727
You would not believe my day.

16:20.062 --> 16:23.815
I had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off...

16:23.983 --> 16:28.111
...I lost one of my fake boobs
in a grill fire.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.991
What are you smiling at?

16:33.158 --> 16:35.451
Sorry, I was just thinking your day
could still pick up.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.084
Hello.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.795
I love this friend thing.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.804
Listen, Robert's gonna be here
any second...

16:54.972 --> 16:57.015
...so could one of you just tell him?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.683
- Oh.
- Please, right now.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.854
No, every time I see him, it's like,
"Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"

17:04.647 --> 17:05.690
We can't tell him.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.901
You can't go up to a guy you barely know
and talk about his...

17:09.528 --> 17:11.319
...stuff.

17:11.488 --> 17:15.324
He's right. Even if it's
to say something complimentary.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.663
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:20.830 --> 17:21.873
So you ready for the gym?

17:22.040 --> 17:25.084
They've got this new rock-climbing wall.
We can spot each other.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.505
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.135
What?

17:35.012 --> 17:37.555
Okay. Listen, ahem, Robert...

17:37.890 --> 17:41.684
- Hey, don't we have to?
- Yeah, we got... Yeah. Mm-hm.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.314
Um...

17:48.233 --> 17:49.984
I think you're really, really great.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.488
Oh, God. Here we go again.

17:53.655 --> 17:58.201
Why does this keep happening to me?
Is it something I'm putting out there?

18:00.412 --> 18:04.082
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

18:07.169 --> 18:10.880
I don't know what to say.

18:11.048 --> 18:15.802
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.199
Ow.

18:39.034 --> 18:43.538
Really? Well, it's just like
everyone else's apartment.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.540
It's got, uh, rooms and walls and ceilings.

18:45.707 --> 18:48.251
I just wanted to see
where you live. Now give me the tour.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.503
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.880
- Uh, this is the living room.
- That's nice.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.298
All right.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.135
- And this is the kitchen.
- That's real pretty.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.178
Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?

18:59.346 --> 19:03.391
The bedroom.
Well, it's pretty much your typical...

19:04.726 --> 19:07.061
...bedroom.
- Oh, ha, ha.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.480
- We're still on this side of the door. Ha, ha.
- Mm-hm.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.065
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.

19:11.233 --> 19:15.778
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.
Thanks for a lovely evening.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.506
So, um, who is she?

19:35.674 --> 19:39.427
Oh, ha, ha. That was the blind date
I told you about.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.680
- She called and switched it from Tuesday.
- Aw.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.641
Did you like her?

19:45.976 --> 19:50.771
And I'm just asking as a friend
because I am totally fine with this.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.109
Well, you seem fine.

19:55.819 --> 19:59.071
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine. I'm not.

19:59.239 --> 20:02.992
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.578
She wants to see your bedroom.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.587
You know what?

20:16.798 --> 20:19.133
What if we're friends...

20:19.801 --> 20:21.719
...who don't see other people?

20:24.181 --> 20:25.640
You mean like exclusive friends?

20:26.475 --> 20:28.059
Why not?

20:28.810 --> 20:32.146
I mean, this has been
the most amazing week.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.566
Would it be so terrible?

20:36.401 --> 20:40.488
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

20:42.824 --> 20:47.161
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends...

20:47.329 --> 20:50.748
...and vowed to be friends forever.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.378
Wow.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.507
You know, we're back where we were.

21:01.051 --> 21:06.305
Honey, I would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

21:06.473 --> 21:10.226
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.730
Okay. Okay, one thing's changed.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.859
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.612
You know what?

21:22.030 --> 21:24.865
I gotta walk out of here right now.

21:26.201 --> 21:30.204
Because getting over you is
the hardest thing that I have ever had to do.

21:31.164 --> 21:34.041
Um, I don't think I could do it again.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.003
I know I couldn't.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.047
Yeah.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.051
So...

21:52.436 --> 21:55.354
How about one last game of racquetball?
Hmm?

22:00.902 --> 22:03.404
- Watch the thorns.
- Ow.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.871
What?

22:13.540 --> 22:15.249
Beth is really, really sick.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.751
Oh.

22:20.756 --> 22:24.800
Jo's there, but I don't think
there's anything she can do.

22:28.263 --> 22:29.680
- Joey?
- Yeah?

22:29.931 --> 22:32.350
You wanna put the book in the freezer?

22:33.268 --> 22:35.353
Okay.
