10:35.677 --> 10:36.678

10:36.761 --> 10:38.304
- What is it?
- Big bag o' weed.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.347
It's mint leaves.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.100
And when they dip it in the
zooty chemicals, it turns to angel dust.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.477
And to you, it's $200.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.188
That's a lot of bank
for a little booty bandit like you.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.774
[scoffs] I ain't no booty bandit.
I get more ladies than you.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.818
- Yeah? Like who?
- All the "itas."

10:51.901 --> 10:55.738
Lolita, Onita and Carmelita.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.699
Man, you ain't never had Carmelita.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.951
- Carmelita is one fine <i>mamacita</i>.
- [Boo-Boo] Yeah, I did.

11:00.034 --> 11:03.705
- And she kissed me on the lip.
- Okay, okay, big man. Focus.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.040
Bring back the leaves
while they still wet with chemical

11:06.124 --> 11:09.210
and you graduate from singin' and dancin',
make you some real money.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.420
You need me to carry this?

11:10.503 --> 11:13.339
Yeah, I need you to take these
to a nigga named Popeye.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.259
He gonna dip this shit. Then I need you
to bring back the zooty bang.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.636
- You dig?
- Cool. Who's Popeye?

11:18.720 --> 11:22.390
He a Vietnam vet. They say he know
ten ways to kill a man with his pinky.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.809

explain these numbers to me.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.540
If I may.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.250
Page one comes from Accounting.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.628
It breaks down everything to do
with Mylene's second single.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.505
It entered the charts at number 43,
which is probably where it will peak.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.051
- Then you got the gross, net...
- Shane. Tell him about page two.

11:58.468 --> 12:02.597
Page two. This page right here,
this is the really exciting part.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.682
Basically, the numbers on page two,

12:04.766 --> 12:07.769
they represent a predictive, statistical
and marketing analysis that Mylene...

12:07.852 --> 12:11.356
Shane's computer is just saying
what I've been saying for the last month.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.566
We believe Mylene can become

12:13.650 --> 12:16.069
the number one disco artist
in the country.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.862
She brought down the house
on <i> Platinum Boogie</i>,

12:17.946 --> 12:21.824
so we are willing to commit the resources
and spare no expense

12:21.908 --> 12:24.494
for Mylene to record her first full album

12:24.577 --> 12:26.704
on Marrakesh Star Records.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.623
[Francisco and Shane laugh]

12:28.706 --> 12:32.835
- An album. Oh, this is great news then.
- It's good business.

12:32.919 --> 12:37.757
Mylene is worth the risk.
Singles exist to sell albums.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.841
That's where the money is.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.010
[Shane] And the money, Cisco.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.888
We're talking about the possibility
of seven or eight figures.

12:43.972 --> 12:47.058
And that's per album.
And this would just be the first of many.

12:47.725 --> 12:48.559
Come here.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.687
I get a little emotional.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.023
- [Francisco] Thank you.
- [chuckles]

12:55.316 --> 12:59.070
Here's the thing.
Mylene's two little disco hymns were hits,

12:59.404 --> 13:03.741
but no way can we do a full album
of religious music.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.494
This ain't Utah. We ain't Mormons.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.413
Mylene, she's Pentecostal.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.541
My grandma's a Sufi mystic.
I'm not trying to take her to number one.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.292
So, what exactly are you saying?

13:13.376 --> 13:15.503
I'm saying this religious stuff,
it's... it's nice,

13:15.586 --> 13:17.505
but it don't crack the top 40.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.298
It's like this "Muskrat Love"

13:19.382 --> 13:22.135
or Alvin and the fuckin' Chipmunks.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.887
- It's a gimmick.
- So, what exactly are you suggesting?

13:27.265 --> 13:30.518
Sex. It's ageless, it's timeless
and it sells.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.854
Roy is just sayin'
maybe we can get Mylene

13:32.937 --> 13:35.273
- out of the fringes, into the main...
- Mylene's a good girl.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.399
So's Donna Summer.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.317
Donna's very religious.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.278
But she plays a role.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.864
We always keep it clean
and she's got six albums now.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.532
[Roy] A serious artist.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.701
Not a novelty act.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.913
And as a result,
Donna's children's children's children

13:50.997 --> 13:52.540
most likely be set for life.

13:53.124 --> 13:56.127
Mylene, honestly,
she's like a daughter to me.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.464
We're not looking at this as some kind of
quick payday off of her.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.884
I'm talking about
long-term financial growth.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.218
Don't say anything.

14:04.594 --> 14:05.887
Think about it for a minute.

14:05.970 --> 14:06.846
Okay, okay, okay.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.182
I... I hear you. I hear both of you.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.647
[Ezekiel] <i>Hey, well, listen.</i>

14:16.731 --> 14:19.776
<i>- You know how Leon got a sister?</i>
<i>- </i> [Mylene] <i>That lives on Long Island?</i>

14:19.859 --> 14:21.527
Yeah. Well, she just had a baby

14:21.611 --> 14:23.988
and Leon and Wanda
went to visit for a few days.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.740
So, the apartment is empty.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.868
- I was thinking...
- Zeke.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.661
Why didn't you come
to my <i>Tiger Beat</i> shoot?

14:31.746 --> 14:32.789
[sighs]

14:33.122 --> 14:36.376
Truth is, I was feeling bad
about the whole thing at the restaurant.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.086
Bad like I was fucking pissed.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.964
So, I wound up working late
at the office with this girl.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.342
- This girl?
- Yeah, my coworker.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.718
She pretty?

14:47.178 --> 14:48.679
She's okay, but...

14:48.763 --> 14:49.764
But you got down with her.

14:49.847 --> 14:50.890
No. No.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.186
She did try to kiss me, though.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.521
But it was for a second

14:56.604 --> 14:59.190
and I stopped it
and I got the hell out of there fast.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.360
I just wanted to be honest with you.
I'm sorry.

15:05.655 --> 15:06.489
Mylene.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.741
- Mylene.
- You know what?

15:09.200 --> 15:10.326
I should be honest, too.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.788
The night of my photo shoot,
Shane drove me home

15:13.871 --> 15:15.164
and I was upset.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.543
I mean, I've been upset with everyone
wanting things from me, so...

15:18.626 --> 15:21.754
I got emotional and we smoked a joint
together so I could calm down.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.631
Wait, you smoked weed
with somebody else?

15:23.714 --> 15:24.632
You kissed somebody else.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.716
She kissed me.

15:25.800 --> 15:26.717
You kissed back.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.137
Are you in love with him?

15:30.721 --> 15:32.598
- Are you in love with him?
- What?

15:33.057 --> 15:36.519
Hell, no, Zeke, I told you he got a wife
and he ain't you.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.276
Remember when we promised,
all we gotta do is love each other?

15:44.235 --> 15:45.069
Of course.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.447
I think...

15:47.738 --> 15:48.573
we both...

15:49.365 --> 15:50.199
I mean...

15:51.534 --> 15:53.244
maybe we forgot that a bit recently.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.748

[overlapping chatter]

30:44.176 --> 30:45.552
Now, here's your competition.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.096
Something the matter?

30:48.180 --> 30:49.014
No, sir.

30:49.097 --> 30:52.684
I just thought this was a regular event
for all prospective students, not...

30:52.768 --> 30:53.602
Not what?

30:53.727 --> 30:55.979
Nothing. Who were the people
in the room we left?

30:56.063 --> 30:58.607
Well, current students,
faculty, distinguished alumni.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.317
You see, Ezekiel, for years,

31:00.400 --> 31:03.570
Yale has been focused
on recruiting minority students.

31:03.945 --> 31:06.531
And even
with the <i>California v. Bakke</i> decision,

31:06.615 --> 31:09.868
our enthusiasm for diversity
has not wavered one iota.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.244
I marched with King.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.746
- Wow, that's...
- I did, too.

31:12.829 --> 31:17.292
Mm-hmm. And, if we could, we would admit
every promising young person in this room,

31:17.376 --> 31:21.129
because we understand that diversity
is an essential component

31:21.213 --> 31:24.424
of our ability to offer the
best possible education to our students.

31:24.508 --> 31:26.468
So, what you need to do is mix and mingle.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.303
Talk to the representatives of Yale.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.679
And just be yourself.

31:30.055 --> 31:33.308
In fact, um... Ezekiel Figuero...

31:33.392 --> 31:36.061
- Catch you later. Hey.
- ...meet Tate Poindexter, class of '78.

31:36.478 --> 31:40.315
Tate, uh, show Ezekiel around,
make sure he meets all of our folks.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.692
You two are practically neighbors,
by the way.

31:42.776 --> 31:44.361
- You're from the Bronx?
- Scarsdale.

31:44.694 --> 31:45.570
Here, come on.

31:45.904 --> 31:46.905
I'll show you around.

31:46.988 --> 31:47.823
Have fun, boys.

31:48.073 --> 31:48.907
Hey.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.826

33:19.873 --> 33:22.667
Hey, Roy, it's lucky
I didn't have this kid shot

33:22.751 --> 33:25.629
when he was into us for 25 large
at the poker table.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.757
- It's a gorgeous song, Jackie.
- Gorgeous! Gorgeous!

33:28.840 --> 33:30.550
- And it's a hit!
- [chuckles]

33:30.634 --> 33:33.011
Ramon, <i>loco,</i>
considering that you took out a loan

33:33.094 --> 33:37.891
for a quarter of a million from the bank
to buy this cathedral,

33:37.974 --> 33:39.643
you better hope this thing is a hit.

33:39.726 --> 33:40.560
Wait. What?

33:40.644 --> 33:42.521
<i>Papi,</i> you... You bought this?

33:42.604 --> 33:46.191
- How are you gonna pay for it?
<i>- Nina,</i> last week,

33:46.650 --> 33:49.361
we were approved
by the National Pentecostal Board

33:49.444 --> 33:51.738
to expand our presence in the Bronx.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.198
This is our sacred mission.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.284
My brother isn't the only one
with a vision.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.995
Now, Jackie, this song of yours, uh...

33:59.955 --> 34:01.164
I have concerns.

34:02.791 --> 34:05.210
This, these lyrics...

34:05.752 --> 34:10.047
"I want to open my eyes
and see you on the other side."

34:10.130 --> 34:11.632
To whom is Mylene referring?

34:11.716 --> 34:14.302
Because it sounds
like she's running away with a lover.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.344
Oh, no, it's...

34:15.428 --> 34:18.639
She's referring to Jesus,
on the other side, in heaven.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.893
Ah. Well, this needs to be clearer.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.728
<i>Oye, hermano. Tranquilo.</i>

34:23.812 --> 34:24.938
It's very clear, Ramon.

34:25.021 --> 34:28.483
Okay, well,
unfortunately Roy and I are running late,

34:28.567 --> 34:31.110
so please let us know whatever you decide.

34:31.527 --> 34:32.362
Nice song, Jackie.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.447
Uh, but, Roy,

34:35.532 --> 34:37.659
<i>Tio </i> said if you like it
we could talk about the album.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.078
Something's come up, Mylene.
Problem in the studio.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.454
We'll reschedule soon.

34:41.538 --> 34:43.039
- Okay.
- Gentlemen, before you go,

34:43.456 --> 34:44.666
I would like you to know

34:44.748 --> 34:47.418
that all of your efforts
on behalf of my daughter,

34:47.502 --> 34:48.712
they are greatly appreciated.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.297
It's our pleasure.

34:51.047 --> 34:51.880
Thank you.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.759
But also, know this:

34:55.051 --> 34:57.679
Given the incredible undertaking

34:57.762 --> 34:59.848
that we are embarking on
with this new church...

35:01.850 --> 35:05.186
Mylene must be present in the church

35:05.562 --> 35:08.982
and she must sing more for the church

35:09.608 --> 35:13.069
to fill the Lord's seats
and the parishioners' hearts

35:13.153 --> 35:16.698
with love, faith and generosity.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.992
And she will have her career, too.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.453
The will of Jehovah is first,

35:21.536 --> 35:25.624
and then her family and then
the church and its parishioners

35:25.707 --> 35:28.084
and only after that, her career.

35:28.335 --> 35:29.628
- Are we clear?
- Crystal.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.672
And we appreciate your candor,
Pastor Cruz.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.132
Bye.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.426
[stammers] I'll be waiting on your call.

35:37.010 --> 35:37.844
All right.

35:38.511 --> 35:40.472
[Roy] First he kills the <i>Tiger Beat</i> cover,

35:40.555 --> 35:45.060
now this fucking douchebag pastor,
fucking sanctimonious prick.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.227
Fuck yeah, man.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.855
So, when should I reschedule with Mylene?

35:49.022 --> 35:50.231
Don't reschedule.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.524
Don't call her.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.027
Don't give her a call back
if she calls you.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.362
Give it about a week.

35:55.445 --> 35:57.614
She'll go into a panic
that we've forgotten her.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.825
After that she'll do and sing
whatever the fuck we say.

36:00.909 --> 36:05.288
"Toy Box" and Stigwood's fucking movie,
and fuck Misty Holloway, too.

36:05.413 --> 36:06.247
[Shane] Genius, Roy.

36:06.748 --> 36:07.624
Feel like a burger?

36:07.832 --> 36:10.752
Let me ask you straight up,
and don't take this the wrong way,

36:10.835 --> 36:12.128
but why Yale?

36:12.629 --> 36:14.005
I mean, if you got the grades,

36:14.089 --> 36:16.966
why not go to one of those Ivy League
black schools down South?

36:18.176 --> 36:19.010
Um...

36:21.179 --> 36:22.097
Here you are, sir.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.099
Because I'm not just black.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.726
So, then what are you?

36:27.519 --> 36:28.937
A Jew like Tate here?

36:29.020 --> 36:29.979
What does it matter?

36:30.605 --> 36:31.648
- What are you?
- Excuse me?

36:31.731 --> 36:34.651
He's black and Puerto Rican, Strawbridge.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.236
[speaking in accent] Puerto Rican.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.697
- I should've guessed by your shoes.
- His shoes?

36:38.780 --> 36:41.533
[in normal voice] Yeah, don't you know why
all Puerto Ricans got pointy shoes?

36:42.033 --> 36:44.619
[with accent] So they can kill
all the cockroaches in the corners.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.580
[laughs]

36:48.832 --> 36:49.833
Yale men can drink.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.876
- Can you drink?
- What you got?

36:52.460 --> 36:54.421
Bartender, some shots.

36:54.504 --> 36:55.338
Line 'em up.

36:55.672 --> 36:56.506
Yes, sir.

36:56.589 --> 37:00.385

50:13.761 --> 50:16.305
Anybody ain't up these fucking stairs
and in this house

50:16.388 --> 50:19.808
by the time I count five,
I'm gonna beat the black off you.

50:19.892 --> 50:20.935
[Boo-Boo] This is your fault.

50:21.018 --> 50:23.562
Until it grows back
and beat if off you again twice!

50:23.646 --> 50:25.105
No, that's a special edition.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.024
Ah!

50:27.107 --> 50:29.068
- Are you a drug dealer?
- What the f...?

50:29.151 --> 50:31.111
- Are you a goddamn drug dealer?
- [Ezekiel] No! What?

50:31.195 --> 50:33.447
Found your stash box, that's right.

50:33.739 --> 50:35.449
And you high right now, ain't you?

50:35.532 --> 50:38.619
Looking like Charlie Chan's
Puerto Rican half-breed love child.

50:38.702 --> 50:41.538
- I'm not high and I'm not a drug dealer.
- Empty your pockets.

50:41.789 --> 50:42.623
No, what?

50:42.706 --> 50:45.417
After everything we've been through
with your no-good father!

50:45.501 --> 50:47.211
Apple never fall far from the tree.

50:50.756 --> 50:52.049
Where did you get this from?

50:52.716 --> 50:55.135
- Don't lie to me!
- I'm an MC. I'm a performer.

50:55.219 --> 50:56.887
We make music. You know that.

51:03.852 --> 51:05.312
Hey.

51:05.938 --> 51:07.231
Princess Mylene.

51:07.982 --> 51:11.151
Um... Books ain't here
if that's who you're looking for.

51:12.611 --> 51:14.238
[Adele] What is this?

51:16.115 --> 51:16.949
Reefer.

51:17.157 --> 51:17.992
Spray paint.

51:18.492 --> 51:19.326
Markers.

51:20.202 --> 51:21.161
[Adele] More reefer.

51:21.704 --> 51:22.538
A condom.

51:23.747 --> 51:24.581
Cigarettes.

51:26.417 --> 51:29.253
- My grandfather's switchblade?
- And more reefer.

51:30.212 --> 51:31.505
- [Adele] Oh, no.
- What?

51:32.131 --> 51:33.007
What's this?

51:34.383 --> 51:35.718
[Winston] Where's the cocaine, Marcus?

51:36.135 --> 51:38.220
- Cocaine?
- Don't lie to me, son.

51:38.304 --> 51:40.014
All that, I know you selling drugs.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.724
You got your brothers slinging too?

51:41.890 --> 51:43.517
- No, Dad.
- It's not true.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.769
It's not true.
We got the money from the music.

51:45.853 --> 51:48.439
We're trying to build a business,
like you and Mom with the shop.

51:48.522 --> 51:50.566
- Yeah, sure.
- [Wanda] So, tell me this.

51:51.358 --> 51:52.359
Where's the gun?

51:53.193 --> 51:54.778
Gun? What? I don't got no gun.

51:55.612 --> 51:57.823
- What gun?
- Ditched it in the river, probably.

51:57.906 --> 52:01.118
Your teacher came here tonight
with that Francisco Cruz.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.370
They said you pulled a gun
on some white people

52:03.454 --> 52:05.873
- at that college event today.
- It wasn't me.

52:05.956 --> 52:07.416
- Who was it?
- It wasn't nobody.

52:07.499 --> 52:10.336
Must've been somebody, because
they fired you from that internship.

52:10.419 --> 52:12.546
You can kiss
that college scholarship goodbye.

52:12.629 --> 52:15.090
Crashing Ezekiel's college event
with a gun?

52:15.174 --> 52:17.259
Ruining his chance of going to Yale?

52:17.343 --> 52:19.303
- My <i>tio </i> told me.
- Take a chill pill, all right?

52:19.386 --> 52:21.722
You need to go back to
whatever sewer hole you came from.

52:22.306 --> 52:28.103
Ezekiel has a future, a real future,
and you... You can't stand it, can you?

52:28.520 --> 52:33.317
So, you sell him on this
bullshit hippity hoppity fake-ass dream

52:33.400 --> 52:35.319
so you can watch him sink to your level.

52:35.402 --> 52:37.237
And I suppose this paint you got stashed

52:37.321 --> 52:39.740
is because you got a commission
from the Rockefellers

52:39.823 --> 52:42.993
- to redesign the city hall.
- I paint the club we perform at.

52:43.077 --> 52:43.911
I told you this.

52:43.994 --> 52:47.581
A truancy officer came by this evening
and said that Boo-Boo cut school.

52:47.664 --> 52:51.210
I told him he must be mistaken
until he showed me the summons.

52:51.293 --> 52:53.128
They didn't call my name for attendance.

52:54.421 --> 52:55.964
Got some 411 for your uppity ass.

52:56.048 --> 52:58.425
Our music is a reality.
Ain't no fucking dream.

52:58.509 --> 53:02.471
Your music is a joke!
It's not even music, Shao.

53:02.554 --> 53:05.224
You fucking take songs,
real songs, and you...

53:05.307 --> 53:07.476
you make noise over it
and say a bunch of rhymes

53:07.559 --> 53:09.228
a ten-year-old can make up
in their sleep.

53:09.311 --> 53:10.479
That's your opinion.

53:12.314 --> 53:15.609
But I'll tell you something else:
Your disco music is fuckin' wack.

53:15.692 --> 53:16.610
Shit won't last.

53:17.111 --> 53:20.614
It's all commercialized and spoon-fed
for some dummies or some shit.

53:20.781 --> 53:21.782
Just like you.

53:23.117 --> 53:24.868
Street performance doesn't make
this kind of money.

53:24.952 --> 53:27.121
We play at clubs now. Les Inferno, 10-51.

53:27.204 --> 53:29.164
- Les Inferno?
- Drug dens.

53:29.248 --> 53:31.583
- Both of them.
- We just perform.<i> Tia,</i> I swear.

53:31.667 --> 53:34.837
You can ask Mrs. Kipling.
You know how strict she is with her kids.

53:34.920 --> 53:37.631
Four rules. That's all I ever asked.

53:37.714 --> 53:41.260
Stay in school, no drugs,
no gangs and no graffiti.

53:41.343 --> 53:43.011
Y'all flying colors now, too?

53:43.345 --> 53:45.889
All we're doing is trying
to make music, I swear!

53:45.973 --> 53:49.101
We let you do the music
because we trusted you!

53:49.184 --> 53:50.936
How are we supposed to trust you now?

53:51.019 --> 53:53.105
Stay the fuck away or you might get hurt.

53:53.188 --> 53:55.566
[funk music playing]

53:57.443 --> 53:59.445
And who's gonna hurt little old me, huh?

54:00.362 --> 54:02.739
- You?
- My <i> tio, </i> Papa Fuerte, okay?

54:02.823 --> 54:04.450
He can take you out like that.

54:04.533 --> 54:07.411
- So, don't test me, Shao!
- Yeah, you know what I heard today?

54:07.494 --> 54:09.746
That nigga old, he done for.

54:09.830 --> 54:12.458
- Good. Keep thinking that.
- Mylene, I got backups here...

54:13.083 --> 54:14.877
but I'm not gonna need them
to protect myself

54:14.960 --> 54:17.254
from some old, nobody spic
like your faggot-ass uncle.

54:17.337 --> 54:21.383
Sabrina Rodriguez told me that
you can't even get it up,<i> puto maricon,</i>

54:21.467 --> 54:23.886
and the way you be all up
in Ezekiel's business,

54:23.969 --> 54:26.805
- maybe you got the hots for my boyfriend.
- [stops music]

54:27.264 --> 54:28.974
- I ain't no faggot.
- Get your own man.

54:32.144 --> 54:34.855
Miss Green and Francisco Cruz
spoke out for you today

54:34.938 --> 54:37.274
and they begged Mr. Gunns
to give you a second chance.

54:37.357 --> 54:39.109
- Okay.
- Tomorrow you're gonna go meet him.

54:39.193 --> 54:40.486
That's great. Okay.

54:40.903 --> 54:42.237
- You better fix it.
- I will.

54:42.988 --> 54:43.822
I promise.

54:44.490 --> 54:46.867
[Shaolin]
And, hey, you got an okay voice...

54:47.993 --> 54:49.495
but you can't shake no booty.

54:49.870 --> 54:52.790
You know why? You're an uptight,
frigid, Bible-ass bitch.

54:52.873 --> 54:54.208
Excuse me?

54:54.291 --> 54:56.001
Donna Summers? Sexy.

54:56.752 --> 54:58.045
Tina Turner's sexy.

54:58.670 --> 54:59.755
Because they all woman.

55:01.924 --> 55:02.758
But you a child.

55:03.175 --> 55:05.802
Nothing between your legs
and nothing between your ears.

55:05.886 --> 55:08.430
You ain't about
to be no fucking disco queen.

55:08.514 --> 55:10.682
Honkies ain't stupid.
They can smell a pretender.

55:10.766 --> 55:12.893
- I'm not a pretender.
- Yes, you are.

55:13.852 --> 55:14.770
Be gone, bitch.

55:20.359 --> 55:23.320
You gotta swing them hips a little harder,
make that ass bounce.

55:23.403 --> 55:24.947
I expected trouble from Dizzee.

55:25.030 --> 55:27.324
He come out the womb
like Hannibal sacking Rome,

55:27.407 --> 55:29.117
but the three of you all at once?

55:29.576 --> 55:34.081
Your mother and I break our asses
to provide and then y'all making mutiny?

55:36.500 --> 55:38.752
Well, now, no more music.

55:38.835 --> 55:40.337
- Period.
- Dad, this is our life.

55:40.420 --> 55:41.880
[Winston] Sit your ass down.

55:41.964 --> 55:43.715
- Man.
- And no more going out.

55:44.007 --> 55:45.884
After school, y'all come straight home.

55:45.968 --> 55:47.844
You do your homework, your chores,

55:47.928 --> 55:53.559
you eat your dinner, brush your teeth,
wash your ass and go the fuck to sleep!

55:53.642 --> 55:54.726
What?

55:55.269 --> 55:57.062
- This is jive.
- [Ra-Ra] Okay, okay, okay.

55:57.145 --> 55:59.773
Dad, Dad, Dad. Listen, listen.
None of this matters, man.

55:59.856 --> 56:02.484
Don't start with me.
Here we go with the negotiations.

56:03.110 --> 56:06.196
You ain't Monty Hall, son,
and this ain't <i>Let's Make a Deal.</i>

56:07.656 --> 56:11.326
You know what? You're right, Dad.
Everything you said is exactly right.

56:12.119 --> 56:12.953
Totally.

56:13.745 --> 56:15.205
I'm sorry for letting you down.

56:15.539 --> 56:17.624
[Winston] No more music.

56:17.708 --> 56:18.834
We're... We're all sorry.

56:21.211 --> 56:22.045
I'm not.

56:22.754 --> 56:23.589
Shut up, Diz.

56:23.672 --> 56:24.631
I love you.

56:26.883 --> 56:27.718
I'm sorry.

56:28.260 --> 56:29.261
I promise I'll fix it.

56:33.557 --> 56:34.850
And now you have a curfew.

56:41.231 --> 56:42.608
[Wanda] <i>And no more music.</i>

56:47.779 --> 56:50.282
["Love Don't Live Here Anymore" playing]
