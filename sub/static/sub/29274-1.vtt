for anything.

16:48.615 --> 16:50.051
Yeah, and then
I got the opportunity

16:50.183 --> 16:51.753
- and I decided to do it.
- Look, I don't mind you going.

I just wish you would've
told me, that's all.

16:54.287 --> 16:56.390
Well, I just apologized, Dani.

16:57.424 --> 16:59.327
You didn't apologize,
you said sorry,

16:59.460 --> 17:01.428
which sounds more like,
"Too bad."

17:06.299 --> 17:07.602

And I don't need an apology.

about it, that's all.

I should just leave.

can you come?

I was dating Connie

to the train station.

back for you.

Well, the truck
only had room for two.
