01:13.920 --> 01:15.359
Hey!

01:18.120 --> 01:19.520
Hey.

01:32.439 --> 01:35.120
- Faster, Callum! Faster!
- Beautiful!

01:39.719 --> 01:42.560
- Yeah, that's a lot of...
- Look at the hills. They're beautiful.

01:45.519 --> 01:47.079
Smile for the camera!

01:47.200 --> 01:49.560
Hello! Hey! Hello, Mum!

01:52.840 --> 01:55.079
- My God.
- Whoo!

01:55.200 --> 01:56.600
Faster!

01:58.200 --> 01:59.240
I love you!

01:59.359 --> 02:00.359
I love you too!

02:00.480 --> 02:01.560
Whoo!

02:03.079 --> 02:04.159
Go faster!

02:07.439 --> 02:08.520
Whoo!

02:27.199 --> 02:28.319
Faster, Callum!

02:49.240 --> 02:50.120
January!

02:50.240 --> 02:51.680
Is she going to be okay?

02:51.800 --> 02:53.480
Is she going to be all right?

02:54.759 --> 02:56.799
Hey. Hey. Hey, Jan. Hey.

02:56.919 --> 02:59.000
Stay with me babe, okay?

03:00.680 --> 03:01.800
Jan.

03:01.919 --> 03:03.319
Someone talk to me!

03:03.439 --> 03:05.240
Is she going to be okay?

03:15.280 --> 03:16.520
Jan...

06:12.000 --> 06:14.120
Mum! Mummy!

06:14.240 --> 06:16.199
They're coming!

06:21.680 --> 06:23.439
Is this your house?

06:23.560 --> 06:24.920
Is this where you grew up?

06:25.040 --> 06:27.439
I can't remember.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.920
God, you should see
my Mum's place.

06:28.959 --> 06:30.079
It's a right shit hole.

06:32.639 --> 06:33.800
Fuck.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.439
Ms. Dunfield, I'm Thomas.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.040
Your butler?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.920
The family are very
excited to see you.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.560
You have a butler?

07:14.560 --> 07:15.920
- Welcome.
- Surprise!

07:22.279 --> 07:23.679
January?

07:25.879 --> 07:27.240
Your hair looks nice.

07:29.839 --> 07:31.479
You told them, didn't you?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.400
No one told us about this.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.040
You still look beautiful to me.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.160
I've missed you so much.

07:45.199 --> 07:46.039
Mum.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.840
Mum.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.680
You can't remember anything
before the accident?

08:04.800 --> 08:05.920
Nothing.

08:12.680 --> 08:13.879
Will it come back?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.800
I really don't know.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.576
- Did the doctors check you for clots?
- Yeah.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.480
- Hemorrhages?
- Yes.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.855
Laurence, stop
interrogating her.

08:21.879 --> 08:23.495
I'm just checking
there's nothing else the matter.

08:23.519 --> 08:24.735
She couldn't come back
if there were.

08:24.759 --> 08:25.879
You trust a Mexican doctor?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.279
It's a Brazilian.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.400
Rio's in Brazil, not Mexico.

08:31.519 --> 08:33.480
I did Geography.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.399
Can hold my breath
for three minutes.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.480
Did you, um, make the banner?

08:48.600 --> 08:50.680
It... it's good.

08:50.799 --> 08:52.919
It's nothing really.

08:54.559 --> 08:55.919
How long was I away for?

08:56.039 --> 08:57.879
- Six years.
- Six.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.959
How did you crash the scooter?

09:03.080 --> 09:04.160
- Dad.
- Shush, Katherine.

09:04.279 --> 09:05.439
I'm curious myself.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.000
Were you speeding?

09:11.840 --> 09:13.120
Then you could have slowed down.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.200
I was there too.

09:16.039 --> 09:17.480
It's just as much my fault.

09:23.279 --> 09:25.240
One of you can still walk.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.279
You should keep your mouth shut.

09:52.039 --> 09:54.039
Callum.

09:54.159 --> 09:55.439
Hey, hey, come on.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.200
So what do I need around here?

10:21.320 --> 10:23.160
Wellies? Boots?

10:23.279 --> 10:24.720
Cloth cap? Whippet?

10:26.759 --> 10:27.840
Jan?

10:30.240 --> 10:31.240
Jan?

10:32.399 --> 10:34.840
When she hugged me,
nothing came back.

10:36.399 --> 10:37.879
I didn't ask for this.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.799
Well, where else
could we have gone?

10:42.200 --> 10:44.240
I'm only here because I'm sick.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.080
They must think
I'm so fucking selfish.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.480
No, they don't.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.879
Didn't I ever tell you
why I left?

10:56.559 --> 10:58.439
Well, you wouldn't
talk about it.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.800
What if I never remember?

11:03.279 --> 11:06.839
Well, when you first woke up,

11:06.960 --> 11:09.000
you thought I was there
to change the bedpans.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.320
But you remember me now,
don't you?

11:13.440 --> 11:14.880
You felt right.

11:15.919 --> 11:17.120
So will they.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.320
Eventually.

11:20.919 --> 11:23.719
Come on.
Let's take your drugs.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.320
Yeah?

11:30.679 --> 11:33.000
I have prepared
the guest room for you, sir.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.919
It's across in the east wing.

11:35.039 --> 11:36.519
No, I'm all right here.
Thanks.

11:36.639 --> 11:38.919
Only married couples
can share beds, sir.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.480
House rules, I'm afraid.

11:43.759 --> 11:45.399
What century is this?

11:46.960 --> 11:48.240
I'll be outside.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.399
Now I feel like
Mister fucking Darcy.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.680
I love you.

12:10.759 --> 12:12.080
See you in the morning.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.240
I think I prefer
the other part of the house.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.320
Bet you can play some wicked games
of hide-and-seek here though.

12:38.480 --> 12:41.639
The family have never
been ones for games, sir.

12:41.759 --> 12:43.000
How do you know?

12:43.120 --> 12:44.679
Well, I've lived here
all my life.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.280
My father was the butler
before me.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.360
Can I ask you a question?

12:51.480 --> 12:52.639
Of course.

12:52.759 --> 12:54.439
Was January happy here?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.360
I think so.

13:02.679 --> 13:05.120
I'm trying to understand
why she left.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.919
I just want to help her,
that's all.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.919
I'm just a butler, sir.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.240
Your room.

13:21.399 --> 13:22.959
What the fuck?

15:12.840 --> 15:16.320
You... ever shot
anything before?

15:23.279 --> 15:24.600
You want to?

15:33.799 --> 15:35.319
My arms are fine.

15:36.639 --> 15:37.720
I forgot.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.680
You always liked
doing things your own way.

15:43.279 --> 15:45.079
You can do my makeup for me.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.480
Really?

15:48.519 --> 15:50.319
Just don't make
me look like a slut.

15:52.759 --> 15:54.439
Bloody hell!

15:57.279 --> 15:58.919
Never mind.

15:59.039 --> 16:01.039
Have another go.

16:01.159 --> 16:05.639
The recoil takes a bit
of getting used to.

16:08.039 --> 16:10.480
It's only the gangs back home
that have guns.

16:11.519 --> 16:13.360
Well, you need them here.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.360
Hunting, putting things down,
that sort of thing.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.320
That's the way it is.

16:17.440 --> 16:18.720
I suppose it's...

16:18.840 --> 16:21.040
I suppose it's more of a tool
than a weapon out here.

16:21.159 --> 16:22.879
No, it's a weapon all right.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.855
That's the worst mistake
you can make,

16:25.879 --> 16:27.240
to forget that.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.919
We're miles away
from the police here.

16:30.039 --> 16:32.120
What if somebody broke in?

16:33.519 --> 16:36.159
It's always a weapon.

16:40.159 --> 16:41.360
There you go.

16:42.799 --> 16:44.319
Whoa.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.960
Did I get it?

16:49.840 --> 16:52.200
How much would it cost...

16:52.320 --> 16:53.720
for you to go to London...

16:53.840 --> 16:55.720
and not come back?

16:55.840 --> 16:59.120
You don't have a job...

16:59.240 --> 17:01.759
don't have anywhere to live...

17:01.879 --> 17:04.480
If you can't look
after yourself...

17:04.598 --> 17:06.638
how are you gonna
look after her?

17:06.759 --> 17:08.519
I'm staying with her.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.599
And you can't change that.

17:12.279 --> 17:14.358
And besides...

17:14.480 --> 17:15.759
I've got the gun.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.720
It's not loaded.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.000
We...

17:23.118 --> 17:25.559
We'll have more luck
over the hill.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.759
Just be careful going up.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.400
It's slippy.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.600
Callum's nice, isn't he?

17:35.720 --> 17:37.279
He's all right.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.040
Do you have a boyfriend?

17:39.160 --> 17:40.279
No.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.160
All the boys around here
look like Dad.

17:42.279 --> 17:43.559
You should go to the city.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.600
Meet someone
who isn't covered in mud.

17:45.720 --> 17:46.920
I couldn't do that.

17:47.039 --> 17:48.639
Nothing's stopping you.

17:49.640 --> 17:50.880
I'm settled here.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.680
You'll settle for this?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.240
Yes.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.120
This is our home.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.519
This is how we live.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.920
We can't all run away
when we feel like it.

18:05.119 --> 18:07.079
Some of us have responsibility.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.800
You're too skinny.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.200
You need to put on some weight.

18:15.319 --> 18:17.000
I couldn't eat solids
for a month.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.800
We'll have you plumped up
in no time.

18:23.119 --> 18:25.479
So, what do you think?

18:33.240 --> 18:34.680
I'm so glad you're home.

19:02.519 --> 19:04.639
When did you stop liking beans?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.680
I'm fine.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.839
- Come on. Just a little cup.
- No thanks.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.039
Please? For me?

19:12.160 --> 19:13.880
Will you stop mollycoddling her?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.039
Don't you have a job to go to?

19:16.160 --> 19:17.360
It's my day of rest.

19:18.599 --> 19:19.919
Animals don't get sick
on Sunday?

19:21.400 --> 19:23.600
It's the Lord's day.
He's got them covered.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.079
Play nice, you two.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.200
I'm not playing anything.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.456
She can't mind her own business.

19:27.480 --> 19:28.720
Only because I care.

19:28.839 --> 19:30.239
You just have nothing
better to do.

19:30.319 --> 19:31.839
- Yes, I do.
- Like what?

19:31.960 --> 19:33.840
Get married? Have babies?

19:33.960 --> 19:36.279
- Laurence...
- Why don't you all just shut the fuck up?!

19:40.400 --> 19:42.680
Don't speak in front
of Mum like that.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.920
Apologize.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.000
Hang these.

20:08.519 --> 20:09.559
Apologize.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.360
Hey, I actually shot one!

20:13.039 --> 20:14.799
Hey.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.240
Wow.

20:16.359 --> 20:18.479
What you been doing?
Face painting?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.599
What are they, dear?

20:51.440 --> 20:53.120
Morphine.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.559
Can I have one?

20:56.279 --> 20:57.879
You have your own medicine.

21:14.680 --> 21:15.960
Who painted that?

21:18.240 --> 21:19.559
Katherine did.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.480
She did it for me
from an old photograph.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.400
You were away so long
and you never called.

21:27.799 --> 21:29.159
Was I really that bad?

21:30.480 --> 21:32.519
You had your moments.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.160
What the fuck are you doing?

22:07.640 --> 22:09.160
She's having a hard time.

22:09.279 --> 22:11.279
Hard times aren't exclusive.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.759
Everybody has them.

22:12.880 --> 22:16.080
Not everybody disowns
their family though.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.200
Dude, she can't remember.

22:18.319 --> 22:19.879
Dude, I remember.

22:21.319 --> 22:23.240
She's always thought
she's too good for us.

22:23.359 --> 22:24.679
I don't believe that.

22:24.799 --> 22:26.559
She's always been difficult.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.799
Nothing's changed.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.040
She's looking for attention.

22:29.079 --> 22:29.960
Yeah, she can be hard work,

22:30.079 --> 22:31.559
but crippling herself
is a bit much.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.039
No, you crippled her.

22:35.359 --> 22:37.279
But I think she's making
the most of it.

22:38.359 --> 22:39.599
That's sick.

22:39.720 --> 22:42.120
You don't know
what she's really like, do you?

22:43.839 --> 22:47.559
Hey, guess what this is?

22:51.279 --> 22:52.680
It's a ladder.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.640
No?

23:21.119 --> 23:22.119
Jan?

23:24.599 --> 23:25.879
It's nothing.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.200
Are you sick?

23:30.559 --> 23:31.759
What is it?

23:33.519 --> 23:35.440
When did I stop liking beans?

23:38.319 --> 23:39.439
Beans?

23:43.599 --> 23:45.759
Way to kill the mood, babe.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.760
- Seriously.
- What? Seriously?

23:47.880 --> 23:49.200
Did I ever like them?

23:51.079 --> 23:52.199
No.

23:57.359 --> 24:00.319
Something doesn't feel right.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.320
Yeah, that just might be
the amnesia messing with you.

24:04.519 --> 24:06.480
It doesn't explain why I left.

24:08.359 --> 24:11.519
It probably could have
been an age thing, you know?

24:13.599 --> 24:14.696
You might have been difficult.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.600
What do you mean?

24:16.720 --> 24:18.400
No, don't... don't...
Don't worry about it.

24:18.519 --> 24:20.200
You think I did something?

24:20.319 --> 24:24.039
No, no. I'm just saying that
that some families don't always get on.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.400
It doesn't mean that you...

24:26.559 --> 24:28.319
Babe, you're be...
You're being paranoid.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.920
Fine. I'm crazy.

24:30.039 --> 24:31.759
People do just go crazy
for no reason.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.760
Well, the brain damage
might have something

24:33.880 --> 24:35.360
to do with that, yeah.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.240
So I'm making it up now.
It's all my fault.

24:37.359 --> 24:38.479
No, I didn't say that.

24:38.599 --> 24:39.599
Look, you...

24:39.720 --> 24:41.240
You just need time to adjust.

24:41.359 --> 24:43.079
This is all new to you.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.880
This has been hard
for me too, you know.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.599
Hard for you?

24:46.720 --> 24:48.480
I'm the one who can
hardly fucking walk.

24:48.599 --> 24:50.055
I'm the one who
can't remember anything.

24:50.079 --> 24:52.039
Yeah, and I'm the one
who sat by your bedside

24:52.160 --> 24:53.240
for four months.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.599
Do you know how much shit
I've got to deal with?

24:55.720 --> 24:57.456
Do you know how much shit
I've had to deal with

24:57.480 --> 24:59.519
since you crashed the scooter?

25:03.920 --> 25:05.120
Fuck you.

25:09.359 --> 25:10.519
Shit!

25:42.000 --> 25:43.160
I'll find a way.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.880
Thomas?

25:49.000 --> 25:50.279
Is that you?

25:52.119 --> 25:53.439
Yes, sir.

25:53.559 --> 25:55.159
Get in here.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.120
Callum?

27:25.279 --> 27:26.279
Callum?

27:31.559 --> 27:32.559
Callum?

27:34.200 --> 27:35.319
Callum?

27:59.480 --> 28:00.480
Where is he?

28:00.559 --> 28:01.679
Who?

28:03.359 --> 28:04.959
What did you say to him?

28:05.079 --> 28:08.000
I asked him to leave.
He did.

28:08.119 --> 28:09.599
He wouldn't.

28:09.720 --> 28:10.759
I beg to differ.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.120
Callum's not like that.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.839
I made him an offer.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.240
He took it.

28:15.359 --> 28:17.479
He obviously didn't love you
as much as you thought.

28:17.599 --> 28:19.359
Boys can be so mean.

28:21.039 --> 28:22.399
I need to call him.

28:22.519 --> 28:23.879
Phone's dead.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.240
We didn't pay the bill.

28:25.359 --> 28:26.639
One of you must have a mobile.

28:26.759 --> 28:27.960
What for?

28:28.079 --> 28:30.519
This is bullshit.
You're liars! Every...

28:30.640 --> 28:31.920
That's enough!

28:33.480 --> 28:34.960
You don't talk
to anyone like that.

28:35.079 --> 28:36.240
Not at my table.
But I...

28:36.359 --> 28:40.079
- You come back here
after all these years,

28:40.200 --> 28:43.000
we allow
your worthless boyfriend...

28:43.119 --> 28:47.159
- Don't call him that.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

28:47.319 --> 28:53.000
I am tired of you
behaving like an outsider.

28:53.119 --> 28:56.159
You should never have left.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.519
It's changed you.

28:59.799 --> 29:00.799
You're not the same girl.

29:00.839 --> 29:03.839
You're... you're not our Jan.

29:03.960 --> 29:07.799
Your sister was doing
your washing the other day.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.039
She came across a T-shirt.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.400
You know what it said?

29:15.480 --> 29:16.880
"Queen slut."

29:21.880 --> 29:24.280
Do you know what a slut is?

29:26.640 --> 29:29.640
Why advertise yourself as one?

29:31.359 --> 29:35.799
From now on, we are
going back to the old ways.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.680
The way it was before you left.

29:37.799 --> 29:40.519
From now on, you will dress
as a proper girl.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.759
Is that understood?

29:43.240 --> 29:47.680
That boy was no good for you.

29:50.759 --> 29:52.799
You need time to heal.

29:54.359 --> 29:57.439
We are your family.

30:00.599 --> 30:03.719
You don't need anyone else.

30:55.359 --> 30:58.039
Don't you look pretty.

31:01.599 --> 31:04.240
Jan, we were wondering...

31:04.359 --> 31:06.359
We all do chores around here...

31:06.480 --> 31:09.039
Thomas, bless him,
he can't do everything,

31:09.160 --> 31:11.960
so we all pitch in.

31:12.079 --> 31:14.679
I know you weren't very well,
but you can help out now.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.440
It'll make you feel
like you're part of the family.

31:22.039 --> 31:23.879
Might make you feel
closer to Mum.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.160
Thomas.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.840
Come here. Here. Here.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.400
What are you doing?

31:50.240 --> 31:51.759
Pick it up.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.880
Oops-a-daisy.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.320
Probably best
if you don't stand up. Careful.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.880
Careful.

32:41.799 --> 32:44.279
God, I'm so jealous of you.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.840
I'd love a wheely chair.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.640
Can you do tricks yet?

32:50.759 --> 32:53.640
If I had a broken leg
or something

32:53.759 --> 32:57.559
and had one of these,
first thing I'd be doing

32:57.680 --> 32:59.920
is bunny hops
up and down the corridor.

33:00.039 --> 33:03.399
When my head stops spinning,
I'll give it a go.

33:03.519 --> 33:06.160
That bump on the noggin
really fucked you up, didn't it?

33:09.880 --> 33:11.040
Do you still smoke?

33:11.160 --> 33:12.279
Yeah.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.520
Laurence?

33:14.640 --> 33:15.759
Yeah?

33:16.920 --> 33:18.640
Why aren't you
and Katherine married?

33:18.759 --> 33:20.319
'Cause we're brother and sister?

33:20.440 --> 33:21.519
You know what I mean.

33:23.039 --> 33:25.599
Well, to be honest...

33:28.119 --> 33:29.319
I don't know.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.240
It's not like
I'm a virgin or anything.

33:33.119 --> 33:34.159
I'm not ugly, am I?

33:34.279 --> 33:36.079
You're not ugly.

33:41.119 --> 33:42.439
There was a girl.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.880
But I tried to make it work.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.240
But it didn't happen.

33:50.359 --> 33:51.679
How about Katherine?

33:51.799 --> 33:53.759
Some birds just
don't leave the nest.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.000
You're definitely not a virgin.

33:58.599 --> 34:00.599
How many?

34:00.720 --> 34:01.960
I'm not telling you that.

34:02.079 --> 34:04.159
Is it over 20?

34:04.279 --> 34:05.599
I can't remember.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.575
- I'll tell you how many I've had.
- I don't care.

34:07.599 --> 34:09.759
Six. I've had six.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.000
How many?

34:11.119 --> 34:12.199
I'm not saying.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.080
- Come on. You can tell me.
- No, I can't.

34:14.239 --> 34:16.199
- I'm your bro.
- Are you?

34:17.840 --> 34:19.440
You don't think so?

34:23.679 --> 34:26.159
Well, you know how
we can prove it?

34:26.840 --> 34:28.000
How?

34:28.360 --> 34:30.120
Suck my cock.

34:31.599 --> 34:34.400
It's not incest
if you don't think we're related.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.960
And you did just say
I'm not ugly.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.639
Is this a joke?

34:40.760 --> 34:42.159
You tell me.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.599
God, you really
are sick, aren't you?

35:16.679 --> 35:20.039
When you were away,
I never stopped thinking about you.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.199
I've never been out
of the county.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.840
You've been all over the world.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.519
I used to lie in bed
when I couldn't sleep

35:35.639 --> 35:38.319
and imagine what you were doing.

35:38.440 --> 35:41.840
What you were seeing
at that very moment.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.840
You saw some beautiful things,
didn't you?

35:48.280 --> 35:50.240
Tell me about the places.

35:52.519 --> 35:53.840
I can't.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.280
I have flashes.

36:03.199 --> 36:04.919
I can see things...

36:07.239 --> 36:09.000
but it doesn't make sense.

36:14.239 --> 36:16.719
I can...

36:16.840 --> 36:18.320
see beaches...

36:19.800 --> 36:21.720
and forests...

36:25.800 --> 36:28.080
but there's nothing
personal to it.

36:31.400 --> 36:35.680
It's... just air.

36:37.199 --> 36:38.839
What a shame.

36:41.679 --> 36:43.919
Such a waste of a life.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.320
Good night.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.000
- Mum?
- Yes?

37:13.440 --> 37:15.639
Will you stay with me for a bit?

37:45.320 --> 37:47.640
It's pretty chilly.
Best if you stay here.

37:49.119 --> 37:50.719
What's that for?

37:50.840 --> 37:53.120
- See that field?
- Yeah?

37:53.239 --> 37:54.439
In it, there's a large bull

37:54.559 --> 37:56.920
whose testicles
I need to examine.

37:57.039 --> 37:59.000
And I'm going to make sure
it's bloody unconscious

37:59.119 --> 38:00.639
before I do so.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.880
Back in a jiffy.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.039
Put the radio on if you like.

38:21.159 --> 38:22.639
I'm okay.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.760
He thinks he's a vet.

38:42.079 --> 38:44.239
Come back. Come back to me now.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.039
You are doing so well.

38:52.679 --> 38:54.599
Good. That's it.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.080
You could be a ballet dancer.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.440
I'm so proud of you.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.480
- Mum?
- Yes?

39:20.599 --> 39:22.480
What's my favorite color?

39:27.079 --> 39:30.239
I thought you ladies
might like some refreshment.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.240
That's so sweet of you, Thomas.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.800
Thank you.

39:52.679 --> 39:53.919
Okay.

39:54.039 --> 39:55.759
Where's the nearest phone?

39:57.239 --> 39:58.439
It's in the village.

39:58.559 --> 40:00.159
Can you take me to it?

40:00.280 --> 40:02.040
With your father's
permission, yes.

40:02.159 --> 40:03.879
I don't need his permission.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.320
Look, your father is
very protective of you in this state.

40:07.480 --> 40:10.159
I need to ring Callum.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.655
I don't think it's wise to be having
this conversation here, Miss.

40:12.679 --> 40:13.856
All you have to do
is take me there.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.200
I can look after myself.

40:17.559 --> 40:20.000
Your family love you very much.

40:20.119 --> 40:21.799
You shouldn't disappoint them.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.440
Now, is there anything else?

41:13.920 --> 41:15.280
Jan?

41:21.920 --> 41:23.240
January?

41:35.360 --> 41:36.480
Jan?

41:46.599 --> 41:47.799
Jan, are you in there?

41:47.920 --> 41:49.119
I'm getting changed.

41:49.239 --> 41:50.919
- Do you need a hand?
- No, I'm fine.

41:52.519 --> 41:54.559
Are you fucking deaf?
Go away!

41:55.719 --> 41:57.159
I was only trying to help.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.000
You don't have to be
a bitch about it.

42:56.199 --> 42:58.519
Jan, it's time for breakfast.

43:06.679 --> 43:08.679
I'm sorry about
calling you a bitch.

43:08.800 --> 43:09.920
I didn't mean it.

43:12.679 --> 43:14.719
We can go out today if you want.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.079
Go to the village.

43:16.199 --> 43:17.639
Do some shopping.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.639
Jan, this is silly.

43:32.280 --> 43:34.640
Fine. Have it your way.

44:24.159 --> 44:26.159
January?

44:26.280 --> 44:28.880
I'm warning you.
Open this door at once.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.159
Albert, you're scaring her.

44:31.280 --> 44:32.280
Shut up.

44:47.559 --> 44:50.519
I swear to God,
I will kick this door down

44:50.639 --> 44:52.839
if you don't open
the door this minute!

44:52.960 --> 44:54.000
Daddy...

44:54.119 --> 44:55.880
Albert, stop it. Stop it.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.440
January, open this door!

45:09.679 --> 45:11.239
January...

45:13.079 --> 45:15.000
I'm angry with you, darling.

45:16.639 --> 45:18.319
Take all the time you want.

45:20.719 --> 45:22.159
I love you.

45:41.360 --> 45:42.480
January?

45:44.800 --> 45:47.000
I'd really like
to hear your voice.

47:18.119 --> 47:20.159
January, open this door!

47:20.280 --> 47:24.519
Door! Door! Door!

50:32.400 --> 50:34.160
In the room.

50:34.280 --> 50:36.680
You're being
very stupid right now.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.760
Keys.

50:46.800 --> 50:48.480
Get in!

50:48.599 --> 50:50.519
How far do you think
you're going to get?

50:54.719 --> 50:56.199
Come on!

51:00.840 --> 51:01.840
In.

51:05.599 --> 51:06.639
Close the door.

53:17.199 --> 53:18.480
You see what you've done?

53:20.480 --> 53:21.920
I should have
fucking killed her.

53:22.039 --> 53:23.320
You can't. She's mine.

53:24.800 --> 53:26.240
She held a knife to your throat.

53:26.360 --> 53:27.599
She's not well.

53:27.719 --> 53:29.439
You're in so much trouble.

53:32.079 --> 53:36.440
January, we're trying
to understand your situation.

53:36.559 --> 53:39.119
It's very hard for all of us.

53:39.239 --> 53:40.959
You're not my dad.

53:41.079 --> 53:43.079
He's not my brother.

53:43.190 --> 53:46.710
And she is definitely not
my fucking sister.

53:48.157 --> 53:49.598
Dad!

53:49.715 --> 53:51.710
You know you're not right
in the head, don't you?

53:51.843 --> 53:53.285
I have proof.

53:55.008 --> 53:56.008
Proof?

53:56.070 --> 53:58.845
I'd like to see that.

53:58.969 --> 54:00.070
I think we all would.

54:01.481 --> 54:03.248
It's in my pocket.

54:13.960 --> 54:16.240
Where did you get this?

54:18.239 --> 54:19.679
I won't ask you again.

54:26.519 --> 54:28.719
- You!
- Albert!

54:28.840 --> 54:30.240
It wasn't him.

54:30.360 --> 54:32.200
Albert!

54:36.760 --> 54:39.600
If it wasn't for your mother,
you'd have been dead

54:39.719 --> 54:40.976
the minute you walked
through the door.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.400
My mum killed herself.

54:42.519 --> 54:44.400
I know.

54:44.519 --> 54:45.960
We were here.

54:47.079 --> 54:48.199
Who are you?

54:49.559 --> 54:51.400
People you thought
didn't matter.

54:52.840 --> 54:55.079
Our lives weren't perfect,
but we coped

54:55.199 --> 54:57.000
until your bastard father

54:57.119 --> 54:59.759
came along
and changed everything.

54:59.880 --> 55:01.760
What did you do to my dad?

55:01.880 --> 55:03.119
I made it right.

55:04.559 --> 55:06.079
And Callum?

55:08.199 --> 55:09.839
Worthless.

55:09.960 --> 55:11.199
Just like your dad.

55:16.119 --> 55:18.079
One way or another...

55:19.440 --> 55:20.816
you're going to be
part of this family.

55:20.840 --> 55:22.200
Never!

55:24.039 --> 55:25.320
Yes.

55:27.039 --> 55:29.039
Never.

55:37.239 --> 55:39.119
Please! Please don't
let him do this.

55:39.239 --> 55:40.239
Please don't.

55:40.360 --> 55:42.680
Please, please, please!

55:42.800 --> 55:44.280
Please.

55:44.400 --> 55:46.519
Katherine, please listen.

55:46.639 --> 55:48.400
Mum, help me.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.480
Please.

55:52.599 --> 55:54.039
It's for the best.

55:56.800 --> 55:58.360
Just be brave.

56:00.599 --> 56:01.799
Please!

56:53.920 --> 56:55.200
Please...

57:00.480 --> 57:02.159
Please! Please!

57:03.599 --> 57:06.440
No! Stop!

57:08.760 --> 57:10.080
Please don't!

59:07.719 --> 59:09.159
Clean yourself up.

59:21.440 --> 59:25.039
He might not show it,
but Daddy really does care for you.

59:38.519 --> 59:40.280
I don't have to be nice to you.

59:41.599 --> 59:43.559
Don't believe me?

59:43.679 --> 59:45.919
Dig Callum up and see
what I did to him.

59:53.400 --> 59:54.760
Now let's try that again.

01:00:06.159 --> 01:00:07.719
When Katherine was a young girl,

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.760
I gave her a rabbit.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.280
Every day she fed it,

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.119
played with it.

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:18.159
But one winter, it got so cold,

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.160
all the animals died.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.960
We had nothing to eat.

01:00:25.159 --> 01:00:28.839
So, Father took the rabbit
and broke its neck.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.599
He had to... so that
he could feed us.

01:00:35.239 --> 01:00:37.159
Katherine cried for weeks.

01:00:39.639 --> 01:00:42.679
Sometimes sacrifices
have to be made.

01:00:44.639 --> 01:00:46.799
Sometimes you have to do...

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.320
horrid things to protect
the ones you love.

01:01:36.719 --> 01:01:38.519
There's no point hiding.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.679
Come on, girl.

01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:52.599
You know it's no use.

01:01:58.239 --> 01:02:01.199
No! No! No!

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.079
Just one more.

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:25.519
You need your strength.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.840
Eat.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.440
There's two of you now.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.600
Good girl.

01:02:43.719 --> 01:02:44.919
Good girl.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.039
A pregnant girl shouldn't be
living in a basement.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.760
You're really upsetting Mummy.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.880
A real mum wouldn't
let this happen.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.080
We're only taking what's ours.

01:03:32.199 --> 01:03:34.439
You think this'll make
all this yours?

01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:35.719
It's still my house.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.240
No, it's our house.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.519
We've had it for ages.

01:03:40.639 --> 01:03:42.440
No one cares.

01:03:42.559 --> 01:03:45.599
You know, the villagers don't know that
your daddy's dead.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.800
To be honest, they wouldn't give
a hoot even if they did.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.840
He wasn't... gregarious.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.960
Do you know what that means?

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.360
It doesn't have to be like this.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.000
You can have your old room back.

01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:03.279
Be part of a real family.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.480
All you have to do is ask.

01:04:07.599 --> 01:04:09.000
Open the door.

01:04:28.679 --> 01:04:29.879
Night night.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.680
It's a really good way
of expressing yourself.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.280
Just paint what you feel.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.480
Close them.

01:05:58.239 --> 01:06:00.199
You were always the favorite,

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.320
even though
you were never there.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.920
Mum always said
you were special.

01:06:28.639 --> 01:06:30.239
It was an accident.

01:06:31.239 --> 01:06:32.439
I slipped.

01:06:37.519 --> 01:06:38.759
I'm sorry.

01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:41.960
Can I live upstairs again?

01:07:47.159 --> 01:07:49.920
I promise I'll be good.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.439
How did you sleep?

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.800
Better.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.880
We have a surprise for you.

01:08:26.238 --> 01:08:27.840
Wait till you see this.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.319
You're going to love it.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.879
It's absolutely beautiful.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.680
That's it.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.118
Now then, come on.

01:08:36.238 --> 01:08:37.719
There we are.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.279
Here she comes.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.118
Here we are.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.560
There.

01:08:50.238 --> 01:08:53.880
And... surprise!

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.680
Father and Laurence spent
all night fixing it.

01:09:04.078 --> 01:09:06.800
It was yours
when you were a baby.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.399
What do you say?

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.520
Thank you.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.399
I haven't seen you smile
for so long.

01:10:02.039 --> 01:10:03.600
They told me...

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:09.360
that they would kill you
if I said anything.

01:10:11.279 --> 01:10:13.199
See, they were just the staff.

01:10:13.319 --> 01:10:16.079
They tended the land,
they cooked, they cleaned,

01:10:16.199 --> 01:10:18.720
and this is their revenge.

01:10:20.359 --> 01:10:23.000
To make you suffer...

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:24.760
and to make me serve.

01:10:28.079 --> 01:10:29.760
What did my dad do?

01:10:31.119 --> 01:10:33.720
Thomas, drinks.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.000
Sweet dreams.

01:13:35.479 --> 01:13:37.559
- I'm cold...
- I knew you couldn't be trusted.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.480
You stupid child.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.079
Gonna learn?

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.119
Get up!

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.440
Will you take this to January?

01:15:59.319 --> 01:16:01.519
I do love you.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.440
Mum made you some milk.

01:16:36.119 --> 01:16:37.599
January?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.439
Why do you think I'm special?

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.120
Because of this?

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.840
Just calm down.

01:16:53.239 --> 01:16:55.199
I don't want my baby to live.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.480
Not here. Not with you.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.280
Please.

01:17:00.399 --> 01:17:01.439
Put it down.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.680
What'll you do?
Shoot me?

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.079
You're insane.

01:17:06.199 --> 01:17:07.960
And whose fault is that?

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.319
I want to leave.

01:17:14.439 --> 01:17:16.119
I want to leave right now.

01:17:16.239 --> 01:17:18.599
Why? No one else wants you.

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.520
Why else am I special?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.439
Is it because Daddy never
wanted to fuck you?

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.720
Stop it.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.840
And he never will.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.480
He'll never love you
like he loves me,

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.760
and neither will Mum.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
You'll always come second best.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.720
Go on.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.960
Do it.

01:17:42.359 --> 01:17:43.679
Kill me.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.600
This is not just about you!

01:18:00.359 --> 01:18:02.319
I won't tell Daddy about this.

01:18:04.039 --> 01:18:05.680
It'll be our secret.

01:19:11.039 --> 01:19:14.119
For years, they watched
your father's decline,

01:19:14.239 --> 01:19:16.039
waiting for their chance.

01:19:16.159 --> 01:19:18.079
And when Callum called
about the accident,

01:19:18.199 --> 01:19:19.960
they took their revenge.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.480
See, your father, he forced himself
on one of the coal workers.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:28.119
He got her pregnant.

01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:29.439
Then, when the baby was born,

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.480
he took it off her
and he raised it as his own.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.440
And the woman you thought
was your mother,

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.039
she couldn't live
with the guilt.

01:19:38.119 --> 01:19:40.880
All of the staff knew.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.199
We just had to watch you grow up
and keep everything a secret.

01:19:45.319 --> 01:19:48.199
And your real mother,
she knew everything,

01:19:48.319 --> 01:19:50.399
so she told you,
and that's why you ran away.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.000
Who is she?

01:19:52.119 --> 01:19:53.720
Who's my mum?

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.279
You already know the truth.

01:20:01.359 --> 01:20:02.559
We have to go.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.800
We have to go now.

01:20:08.319 --> 01:20:09.840
Please.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.159
Please, Miss.

01:20:13.399 --> 01:20:14.960
Give me the gun.

01:20:31.039 --> 01:20:32.239
Go on.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.280
January, hello.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.440
You need to calm down
and think about this.

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.359
I'd never hurt you.

01:21:13.479 --> 01:21:14.839
I love you...

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.920
my little sister.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.119
So I guess that blow job's
out the window.

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:04.360
What the fuck is going on?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.960
Not in my fucking house!

01:22:17.239 --> 01:22:20.599
You fucking bitch!

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.800
Mum.

01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.119
I'm so sorry.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:03.760
I'm going to miss you.
