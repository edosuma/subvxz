WEBVTT

00:05.227 --> 00:05.854
Hey, Ariel.
Hey.

00:05.990 --> 00:07.070
Having fun?

00:07.171 --> 00:08.151
Yeah.

00:08.423 --> 00:09.831
Thanks for inviting me.

00:09.935 --> 00:11.421
Oh, thanks for saying yes.

00:11.813 --> 00:13.652
I know it was kind of
last minute, so...

00:14.485 --> 00:15.788
ASHLEY:
Ariel! Wyatt!

00:17.885 --> 00:19.747
They're about to announce
the king and queen.

00:24.516 --> 00:25.770
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:25.963 --> 00:27.300
the king and queen

00:27.447 --> 00:29.149
of the Bates Middle
School Spring Fling...

00:29.234 --> 00:30.434
I give you...

00:30.522 --> 00:32.546
Wyatt Forrester
and Ariel Dubois!

02:19.582 --> 02:20.871
Don't!

02:24.747 --> 02:26.193
Bad dream?

02:28.002 --> 02:29.442
Nightmare.

02:29.578 --> 02:32.985
Honest-to-God nightmare.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.656
Can I ask you something?

02:35.753 --> 02:36.953
Shoot.

02:38.207 --> 02:41.657
Is Ariel going to that big
school dance on Saturday?

02:41.748 --> 02:43.033
Gee, honey...

02:43.112 --> 02:46.152
wasn't that you sitting next
to me at dinner last night,

02:46.342 --> 02:49.214
when Ariel declared that not
only would she not be going

02:49.310 --> 02:51.547
to the big dance at her
school on Saturday night,

02:51.656 --> 02:52.562
but that, furthermore,

02:52.651 --> 02:54.145
she would never be
going to any dances

02:54.245 --> 02:58.233
anywhere for all of eternity,
because Wyatt Forrester

02:58.328 --> 03:00.568
had not invited her
to the Spring Fling,

03:00.664 --> 03:02.712
but was, in fact,
rumored to be going

03:02.801 --> 03:04.312
with her most hated enemy,

03:04.391 --> 03:06.127
Crystal Beckman instead.

03:07.096 --> 03:09.854
She's not going.
She's not going.

03:09.999 --> 03:11.598
She's not going...

03:11.815 --> 03:14.822
and she's absolutely
miserable about it.

03:16.669 --> 03:18.677
Perfect.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.844
Ooh!

04:09.483 --> 04:11.795
That shows too much booby.

04:13.098 --> 04:14.388
What? It does.

04:14.491 --> 04:16.339
Mom would never
let you wear that.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.260
I told you,

04:17.387 --> 04:20.091
I don't want that one, I'm
looking for something special.

04:20.797 --> 04:21.786
Good morning, my tribe.

04:21.870 --> 04:22.914
Who wants pancakes?

04:23.034 --> 04:25.377
Me!
Me, too.

04:25.458 --> 04:26.666
What's the occasion?

04:26.754 --> 04:28.145
It's a lazy
Sunday morning,

04:28.250 --> 04:30.217
and I feel like making pancakes.

04:30.281 --> 04:32.597
JOE:
Well, suddenly, I feel
like making bacon.

04:32.832 --> 04:33.875
ARIEL:
That's it!

04:33.996 --> 04:35.395
I found my dress.

04:36.337 --> 04:37.410
What dress?

04:37.523 --> 04:39.244
That I'm going to wear
to the Spring Fling.

04:39.874 --> 04:40.858
Isn't it beautiful?

04:40.961 --> 04:42.337
Isn't it just to die?

04:42.441 --> 04:44.649
It is.
That is just to die.

04:45.968 --> 04:47.464
But I thought you
weren't going to the dance.

04:47.567 --> 04:51.246
I thought Wyatt Forrester
asked Crystal Beckman

04:51.350 --> 04:53.109
and you'd sworn off dances
forever.

04:53.206 --> 04:55.238
What could have
possibly changed

04:55.431 --> 04:56.992
between now
and last night?

04:57.295 --> 04:58.684
She had a dream.

04:58.838 --> 05:00.086
No kidding.

05:00.813 --> 05:01.676
What do you mean?

05:01.745 --> 05:02.693
What kind of dream?

05:02.812 --> 05:04.420
I dreamed that Wyatt and I
were at the dance,

05:04.528 --> 05:06.483
and I was wearing this dress,

05:06.924 --> 05:10.243
and we talked and drank punch
and had the best time.

05:12.003 --> 05:13.754
Uh-huh.
And then...

05:13.840 --> 05:16.530
when they announced king
and queen, it was Wyatt and me.

05:16.626 --> 05:17.777
And we got on the stage,

05:17.868 --> 05:19.921
and somebody handed me
a big bouquet of flowers,

05:20.003 --> 05:21.586
and put a crown on my head.

05:21.985 --> 05:25.081
And buckets of rose petals
fell from the ceiling.

05:25.968 --> 05:27.785
We were covered in them.

05:27.919 --> 05:29.491
It was so magical.

05:34.555 --> 05:37.040
Well, that sounds like
a lovely dream, sweetheart.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.665
Okay, pancake time.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.481
Wait!

05:40.752 --> 05:42.599
See, when I woke up,

05:42.719 --> 05:44.653
it didn't feel like
a regular dream.

05:45.248 --> 05:47.414
It felt like
one of those dreams.

05:48.276 --> 05:49.582
You know... special.

05:49.663 --> 05:52.640
And now, I think maybe Wyatt's
going to ask me to the dance,

05:52.734 --> 05:55.014
and after all,
I need to be ready,

05:55.154 --> 05:57.805
and I need to have this dress.

05:58.987 --> 06:00.892
Okay, Ariel--
and I'm not saying you are--

06:00.972 --> 06:02.742
but what if you're mistaken
about this dream?

06:02.838 --> 06:05.500
What if Wyatt doesn't
ask you to the dance?

06:05.988 --> 06:07.794
That looks like a
pretty expensive dress

06:07.877 --> 06:10.734
to just have hanging unworn
in your closet, sweetheart.

06:10.848 --> 06:13.702
But... if I don't go,
we can take it back.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.085
And can't we just
look at the dress,

06:16.158 --> 06:17.574
just in case?

06:17.685 --> 06:20.184
And it says in the ad it's at
Your Perfect Day Bridal Salon,

06:20.289 --> 06:22.443
and that's right next
to Fashion Square.

06:22.534 --> 06:23.338
Okaywe'll go look.

06:23.439 --> 06:25.267
Now?
Now, I'm making pancakes.

06:25.325 --> 06:27.580
But suppose someone
goes in and buys it.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.531
I'll take you to see it
right after breakfast.

06:29.627 --> 06:30.514
But, Mom--

06:30.618 --> 06:31.842
Zip. Sit.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.986
Go. Now.

06:35.544 --> 06:36.362
ARIEL:
Really, Mom,

06:36.434 --> 06:38.128
don't you think it's the
prettiest dress ever?

06:39.008 --> 06:40.450
It's the prettiest ever.

06:50.926 --> 06:53.824
Before you get too attached,
how much?

06:54.714 --> 06:56.256
Only...

06:57.760 --> 06:59.072
$148.

07:01.175 --> 07:04.655
Great, well, you can wear it
to every dance you ever attend,

07:04.735 --> 07:06.856
then you can pass it on
to Bridgette, then Marie,

07:07.049 --> 07:09.550
and then I'll be buried in it.

07:10.966 --> 07:12.278
Thanks, Mom.

07:13.861 --> 07:15.317
I'm going to go try it on.

07:29.867 --> 07:30.986
Hello?

07:34.811 --> 07:36.475
Hello?

07:39.017 --> 07:40.641
Hello?

07:40.721 --> 07:42.018
Is anyone back there?

07:43.105 --> 07:45.266
I have an eager 13-year-old

07:45.305 --> 07:48.376
ready to take that little pink
chiffon number off your hands.

07:48.801 --> 07:49.833
Hello?

07:52.355 --> 07:53.682
(quietly):
Oh, my...

07:56.297 --> 07:57.265
Mom, where are you?

07:57.329 --> 07:58.528
It fits perfectly!

07:58.596 --> 07:59.671
Ariel!

08:00.263 --> 08:01.537
Ariel, stay where you are.

08:01.616 --> 08:02.642
Mom?

08:02.848 --> 08:05.008
Come with me.
Mom, what are you doing?

08:06.656 --> 08:09.893
Ariel, you said that the
front door was open, right?

08:09.989 --> 08:11.398
ALLISON:
We just went right in.

08:11.479 --> 08:13.510
The door to the back of
the shop was open, too.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.637
Do you know who
they are yet?

08:18.052 --> 08:20.771
Patty and Claire Chase,
mother and daughter.

08:21.203 --> 08:23.275
Patty owned the shop, and
according to nearby merchants,

08:23.340 --> 08:25.483
Claire used to help out
afternoons and weekends.

08:26.282 --> 08:28.325
Last night, we're thinking
right around closing time,

08:28.857 --> 08:31.012
someone came in
and shot them both.

08:31.291 --> 08:32.993
Was it a robbery?

08:33.313 --> 08:35.731
No money was taken
from the cash register.

08:35.866 --> 08:37.812
Nothing else was disturbed.

08:38.289 --> 08:40.961
Looks like the whole
point was just to kill
these two women.

08:47.095 --> 08:48.496
Those were
the two dead bodies

08:48.560 --> 08:50.496
they were taking out
of there, weren't they?

08:51.975 --> 08:54.558
The woman who owned the
shop, and her daughter.

08:56.502 --> 08:57.997
And they were shot?

08:58.398 --> 08:59.708
Ariel...

08:59.781 --> 09:01.221
Why can't I know?

09:02.070 --> 09:04.060
Yes, they were shot.

09:11.019 --> 09:12.564
How old was she?

09:14.140 --> 09:15.691
The girl, I mean.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.363
Fourteen.

09:32.649 --> 09:33.807
Come in.

09:40.295 --> 09:41.543
JOE:
Hey, kiddo.

09:42.945 --> 09:44.390
Hi, sweetie.

09:45.582 --> 09:46.631
Mom...

09:46.750 --> 09:47.799
Yes, sweetie?

09:47.894 --> 09:49.990
What am I supposed to do
with the dress?

09:55.949 --> 09:59.698
I mean, I can't keep it
or anything.

10:00.323 --> 10:02.260
I don't want to, obviously.

10:04.027 --> 10:06.405
And we didn't pay
for it, so...

10:06.543 --> 10:08.058
I'll take it to work
with me tomorrow.

10:08.133 --> 10:10.515
Someone there will figure
out how we should handle it.

10:14.897 --> 10:16.177
Good night.

10:16.905 --> 10:18.225
Good night.

10:18.401 --> 10:19.817
JOE:
Good night, honey.

10:28.059 --> 10:29.990
So I guess she's
holding up all right.

10:30.327 --> 10:31.527
How about you?

10:32.063 --> 10:33.806
(sighing):
I'm a mess.
Can't you tell?

10:35.646 --> 10:36.869
Here's what
I keep telling myself:

10:36.896 --> 10:38.359
Ariel didn't see the bodies
in that room.

10:39.485 --> 10:41.101
She didn't see any of the blood.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.845
I just keep telling myself

10:43.006 --> 10:46.125
maybe without all those
terrible images in her head,

10:46.324 --> 10:48.925
she'll put all this behind her
quicker than we think.

10:49.796 --> 10:52.027
At least that's
what I keep telling myself.

10:53.140 --> 10:54.435
So what about you?

10:55.060 --> 10:57.314
Do you still have those
images in your head?

10:57.451 --> 11:01.267
Unfortunately, my head is
so crammed with terrible images,

11:01.377 --> 11:02.836
I feel like I should open
a library

11:02.906 --> 11:04.505
and start lending them out.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.261
I'll be okay.

11:11.662 --> 11:15.362
If she's okay, I'm okay.

11:57.659 --> 11:58.925
Bad dream?

11:59.788 --> 12:01.775
Just more terrible images

12:01.832 --> 12:04.567
for the lending library
in my head.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.149
Hmm.

12:12.753 --> 12:14.459
(banging on door)
Mom, open the door!

12:15.409 --> 12:16.350
Mom!

12:23.423 --> 12:24.375
Mom!

12:25.439 --> 12:26.491
Mom...!

12:46.219 --> 12:47.284
Hey, darlin'.

12:50.602 --> 12:52.146
You're up early.

12:54.378 --> 12:55.570
I guess.

12:59.985 --> 13:01.272
What are you working on?

13:01.792 --> 13:02.896
History.

13:03.106 --> 13:04.450
I've got a test
on Friday.

13:04.544 --> 13:05.874
You're, uh...

13:05.961 --> 13:08.975
studying on Monday for
a test you have on Friday?

13:11.838 --> 13:13.463
I couldn't sleep, okay?

13:13.655 --> 13:14.878
Okay.

13:15.808 --> 13:17.342
You want to talk
about it?

13:17.703 --> 13:18.789
No.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.227
I was thinking of making
some cinnamon toast.

13:22.493 --> 13:23.871
Would you like that?

13:25.669 --> 13:27.281
No, not really.

13:29.235 --> 13:31.637
Well, there must be
something I can make you.

13:32.452 --> 13:34.324
Can you make time speed up?

13:35.188 --> 13:36.795
Can you make me
already be at school,

13:36.904 --> 13:37.900
laughing with my friends

13:37.979 --> 13:40.620
instead of sitting here,
thinking about stuff

13:40.677 --> 13:44.287
that I really don't want
to be thinking about?

13:44.404 --> 13:46.354
Or even better,
can you go back

13:46.442 --> 13:48.346
and make yesterday
not happen?

13:51.994 --> 13:53.480
No.

13:55.185 --> 13:57.136
I can't do that.

13:59.745 --> 14:02.750
Then I guess there's really
nothing you can do for me.

14:07.784 --> 14:09.104
Okay.

14:11.395 --> 14:14.140
Well, if it isn't
the famous Ariel Dubois.

14:15.185 --> 14:15.909
Famous?

14:16.041 --> 14:17.034
What does that mean?

14:17.138 --> 14:18.465
You didn't see the paper?

14:18.793 --> 14:20.439
It's all over the front page.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.928
The murders
in that dress shop.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.011
You and your mom
finding the bodies.

14:26.087 --> 14:27.359
My name was in the paper?

14:27.456 --> 14:28.327
Big as life.

14:28.420 --> 14:29.514
Great.

14:29.868 --> 14:31.826
So, was it scary?

14:31.912 --> 14:33.503
Was there a ton
of blood and guts?

14:33.609 --> 14:34.494
Um...

14:34.632 --> 14:37.632
you know, it was really
my mom who found them

14:37.762 --> 14:40.414
and I don't really want to
talk about it, if that's okay.

14:40.669 --> 14:41.990
Sure, whatever.

14:42.918 --> 14:44.251
So, has Wyatt
finally asked you

14:44.334 --> 14:45.714
to the Spring Fling
or what?

14:46.499 --> 14:47.746
Why would he ask me?

14:47.785 --> 14:49.417
You already told me that
he was going with Crystal.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.658
Didn't you hear?

14:50.740 --> 14:51.921
They had a fight.

14:52.008 --> 14:52.976
He's still looking for a date,

14:53.056 --> 14:55.415
and I hear you're number one
on his list of possibles.

14:56.064 --> 14:56.905
Great.

14:57.025 --> 14:58.657
I still don't have
anything to wear.

14:59.143 --> 15:01.034
You better find something quick,
'cause here comes Wyatt.

15:01.106 --> 15:02.147
What?

15:03.793 --> 15:04.768
Hey, Ariel.

15:05.168 --> 15:06.449
Oh, hey, Wyatt.

15:06.744 --> 15:07.872
Bye, Ariel.

15:07.929 --> 15:09.111
Hi, Wyatt.

15:10.656 --> 15:11.839
You heading this way?

15:11.935 --> 15:14.008
Yeah; English with
Mr. Harper.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.431
Oh, I had him last year.

15:15.551 --> 15:16.671
Did he make you
act out a scene

15:16.734 --> 15:17.902
from a famous
novel yet?

15:18.150 --> 15:19.279
No, not yet.

15:19.398 --> 15:21.438
Um, but I think
that's next month.

15:21.501 --> 15:22.821
Yeah, ours was
pretty funny.

15:22.982 --> 15:24.973
Eric Anderson did
Catcher in the Rye,

15:25.030 --> 15:26.293
but he played Phoebe.

15:40.827 --> 15:41.988
Are you okay?

15:43.451 --> 15:44.521
What?

15:47.146 --> 15:48.097
I'm fine.

15:49.075 --> 15:49.786
Are you sure?

15:49.874 --> 15:51.849
You seem kind
of distracted.

15:52.297 --> 15:53.088
No.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.568
Not distracted.

15:56.047 --> 15:57.487
I'm fine.

15:59.183 --> 16:01.007
Well, I... I guess I
better get back to class.

16:01.271 --> 16:02.615
I'll see you
around, okay?

16:10.437 --> 16:11.669
He came in
through the back door.

16:14.531 --> 16:16.700
Are we talking about what I
think we're talking about?

16:18.644 --> 16:21.509
And I take it that this
information came to you...

16:23.003 --> 16:24.292
last night.

16:24.526 --> 16:25.611
He came in
through the back.

16:25.733 --> 16:28.203
He found Patty Chase crying
in the sewing room.

16:28.326 --> 16:29.757
Everything happened
really fast.

16:29.892 --> 16:30.905
Patty turned around,

16:31.010 --> 16:33.522
and he just...
started shooting.

16:33.611 --> 16:35.811
He just kept shooting
until she was dead.

16:35.971 --> 16:38.251
That pretty much corroborates
what forensics told us.

16:38.629 --> 16:40.123
The killer did
his job and split.

16:40.195 --> 16:42.266
Wasn't polite enough to
stick around and leave
us any useful fibers

16:42.353 --> 16:43.384
or fingerprints.

16:43.826 --> 16:45.993
I'm guessing that doesn't
leave us any suspects.
(sighs)

16:46.081 --> 16:47.786
So far, not a one.

16:49.232 --> 16:51.136
Found out Claire's
father, Patty's husband,

16:51.201 --> 16:52.449
died three years ago.

16:52.799 --> 16:55.449
Patty's friends say she
hadn't started dating again,

16:55.631 --> 16:58.023
so no angry ex-husbands or
boyfriends in the picture.

16:59.551 --> 17:00.821
No enemies to speak of.

17:00.904 --> 17:02.358
Not a whole lot for
us to work with.

17:04.526 --> 17:07.117
Yeah, my mom's got me helping
out today for a couple hours.

17:07.207 --> 17:09.662
She's out
with her "mystery man" again.

17:11.157 --> 17:12.972
(giggles)
No, I haven't met him yet.

17:13.348 --> 17:15.932
She won't even admit
she's dating somebody.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.132
It's, like, whatever.

17:17.212 --> 17:18.147
She's having sex.

17:18.236 --> 17:19.532
Big deal.

17:20.467 --> 17:21.563
No, it's okay.

17:21.644 --> 17:22.709
And it's, like, the only time

17:22.786 --> 17:24.155
I can get on the computer
without her hanging

17:24.237 --> 17:25.519
over my shoulder,
you know?

17:27.559 --> 17:28.454
Hang on.

17:28.566 --> 17:30.028
Hi, can I help you?

17:30.100 --> 17:32.778
Um, yeah, I'm here to
pick up my wedding dress.

17:32.820 --> 17:34.484
I had it altered
and somebody, uh--

17:34.590 --> 17:35.957
I think her
name was Patty--

17:36.013 --> 17:37.635
she said I could
pick it up today.

17:37.986 --> 17:38.939
The name's Janet.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.249
Oh, right.

17:44.905 --> 17:46.009
Did you want
to try it on,

17:46.099 --> 17:47.504
just to make
sure it fits?

17:48.137 --> 17:50.872
Um... yeah,
sure, okay.

18:01.688 --> 18:02.710
Okay, I'm back.

18:03.519 --> 18:06.245
Yeah, I got three messages from
Brady, but it's all real casual.

18:06.302 --> 18:07.717
I don't think he's gonna--
(computer beeps)

18:09.393 --> 18:11.445
That weird guy
is IM'ing me again.

18:11.580 --> 18:13.940
He keeps saying he wants
to meet me at Fashion Square

18:13.964 --> 18:15.097
and see a movie.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.678
God, like I really believe
he's 15.

18:16.775 --> 18:18.775
He's probably, you know, 30.

18:21.566 --> 18:23.428
(giggles)
You're crazy.

18:24.595 --> 18:26.268
Okay, but if anything goes wrong

18:26.363 --> 18:29.443
and I get in trouble with my
mom, I'm totally blaming you.

18:31.410 --> 18:36.050
"Hey, Shred182,
you sound really kewl.

18:36.690 --> 18:40.073
"Let's meet. Food court. 4:30.

18:40.158 --> 18:41.320
See ya!"

18:42.336 --> 18:44.049
How long do you think
he'll sit there

18:44.107 --> 18:46.055
before he figures out
he's been stood up?

18:47.720 --> 18:48.712
Hey, I got to go.

18:55.271 --> 18:56.534
You look really nice.

18:57.582 --> 18:58.590
Do I?

18:58.647 --> 18:59.582
Yeah, I love
that dress.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.166
That's one of
my favorites.

19:02.366 --> 19:03.837
Really?

19:06.469 --> 19:07.629
You want it?

19:08.853 --> 19:10.692
Because you... you can have it.

19:12.773 --> 19:14.860
I don't really think I'm going
to need it after all.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.138
The thing is, I don't...

19:21.495 --> 19:23.370
I don't know how
to get out of this.

19:24.844 --> 19:25.713
Have any advice?

19:25.795 --> 19:30.018
Any tips you can offer on how
I'm supposed to tell my fiancé

19:30.679 --> 19:32.222
I'm just not that into him?

19:33.735 --> 19:37.828
Because I think a fresh start
is in order for me.

19:38.352 --> 19:41.070
I think
about 3,000 miles

19:41.141 --> 19:44.068
between he and I is
called for, you know?

19:44.164 --> 19:45.620
Starting right now.

19:52.172 --> 19:53.108
That's my mom.

19:53.187 --> 19:54.235
I'm gonna go get her.

19:55.666 --> 19:56.714
You do that.

19:57.243 --> 19:59.409
Tell her I... I want
to return the dress.

20:01.833 --> 20:02.946
Mom, there is a girl

20:03.025 --> 20:05.147
out there,
completely freaking.

20:05.216 --> 20:07.119
She pulled off
her dress and she's...

20:10.528 --> 20:11.518
Mom, what happened?

20:11.611 --> 20:13.677
It's okay.
Don't be upset.

20:16.687 --> 20:18.055
Oh, my God.

20:18.407 --> 20:21.126
Did your boyfriend do that?
I don't have a...

20:21.199 --> 20:22.598
Don't lie to me.

20:23.446 --> 20:24.694
Please.

20:26.828 --> 20:29.910
Okay. I broke up with him.

20:30.228 --> 20:32.159
I think this was his
parting gift to me.

20:33.559 --> 20:34.686
But look, he's gone now

20:34.780 --> 20:36.659
and he's not
coming back, so...

20:37.358 --> 20:38.860
let's just forget him.

20:39.021 --> 20:40.067
Okay?

21:06.960 --> 21:08.239
Mom?

21:08.432 --> 21:09.959
Can you come out here, please?

21:10.552 --> 21:12.239
Can you come
out here, please?

21:14.383 --> 21:15.879
ARIEL (as Claire fades):
Mom?

21:16.254 --> 21:17.902
Mom, please?

21:22.165 --> 21:23.678
What's going on back there?

21:24.141 --> 21:25.612
Ariel, is something
the matter?

21:26.477 --> 21:28.337
I'm fine. Really.

21:32.012 --> 21:33.668
She won't leave me alone.

21:34.643 --> 21:36.531
Who won't?

21:37.875 --> 21:40.129
I'm guessing the girl
who died yesterday.

21:43.666 --> 21:45.634
I'm having dreams about her.

21:46.803 --> 21:50.400
Scary, awful dreams
about her murder.

21:54.232 --> 21:56.905
What am I supposed
to do about it?

21:59.974 --> 22:01.327
I don't know.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.767
I don't have a good
answer to that question.

22:03.847 --> 22:08.295
I've struggled with that
same thing my whole life.

22:08.437 --> 22:09.645
Great.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.518
Her mom has
this boyfriend.

22:17.244 --> 22:18.867
Doesn't seem very nice.

22:20.123 --> 22:22.091
I think he may
have hit her once.

22:23.803 --> 22:25.123
This is great.

22:25.214 --> 22:26.739
Honey, thank you.

22:27.067 --> 22:29.763
I'll call Detective Scanlon
and let him know.

22:29.873 --> 22:31.227
If you have any
other dreams...

22:31.307 --> 22:33.713
I don't want any more dreams.

22:34.529 --> 22:37.032
I just want for all
of this to go away.

22:38.169 --> 22:40.187
I want a normal life.

22:40.274 --> 22:41.705
I want to be normal.

22:41.785 --> 22:43.329
You are normal.
Right.

22:44.169 --> 22:45.936
You should've never
had children.

22:46.986 --> 22:48.448
Not when you knew
there was a chance

22:48.507 --> 22:50.015
they'd be like you.

22:56.029 --> 22:57.583
All locked up.

23:00.733 --> 23:02.325
Did Ariel say "good night"?

23:04.827 --> 23:06.195
Just not to me.

23:07.561 --> 23:08.948
She'll come around.

23:09.163 --> 23:10.163
Give her time.

23:11.203 --> 23:12.562
What if she doesn't?

23:12.635 --> 23:14.058
She will.

23:20.126 --> 23:21.675
PATTY:
Hey, it's me.

23:21.764 --> 23:22.916
When are you gonna be home?

23:24.561 --> 23:26.377
Okay, but come straight home
after practice.

23:26.465 --> 23:28.474
No dawdling
with the friends, okay?

23:29.265 --> 23:30.281
Did you, uh,

23:30.361 --> 23:32.416
change your Friend Section
password?

23:33.288 --> 23:36.031
Claire, come on, we agreed
you could have the page

23:36.127 --> 23:38.415
as long as I have
unrestricted access.

23:39.583 --> 23:41.357
The password, please.

23:42.911 --> 23:45.061
Invasive? Yeah, that's cute.

23:45.182 --> 23:47.334
Thank you. See you later.

23:48.826 --> 23:50.517
Invasive.

24:07.210 --> 24:07.817
MAN (on voicemail):
Leave a message

24:07.895 --> 24:09.562
after the beep
and I'll get back to you.

24:09.689 --> 24:11.047
(machine beeps)
Uh, Mr. Wallaby,

24:11.143 --> 24:12.327
uh, yes, this is Patty Chase

24:12.416 --> 24:14.136
of Your Perfect Day
Bridal Salon.

24:14.736 --> 24:17.216
I'm calling about a wedding
dress that was

24:17.312 --> 24:19.351
dropped off here yesterday

24:19.534 --> 24:21.887
by your fiancee, Janet.

24:22.701 --> 24:24.174
You know, I-I believe

24:24.293 --> 24:25.677
she indicated
to my daughter Claire,

24:25.784 --> 24:28.445
that she wanted to return
the dress you purchased for her,

24:28.565 --> 24:29.836
but I'm afraid
that won't be possible,

24:29.901 --> 24:31.052
since it's been altered.

24:32.093 --> 24:33.573
Would you have
her contact me, please?

24:33.668 --> 24:34.638
My number is

24:34.715 --> 24:37.372
555-0132.

24:41.756 --> 24:42.672
Oh, Claire...

24:43.128 --> 24:45.102
what have you done?

24:50.085 --> 24:51.556
(mumbling):
What's going on?

24:52.468 --> 24:53.741
Everything okay?

24:53.836 --> 24:55.060
Everything's fine.

24:55.125 --> 24:56.900
Just... I had
another dream

24:56.956 --> 24:58.956
about the bridal
shop killings.

24:59.147 --> 25:01.803
I didn't see the killer.

25:02.170 --> 25:03.923
At least I don't
think I did.

25:05.475 --> 25:08.610
That's all the more reason
to go back to sleep.

25:09.146 --> 25:10.561
Hmm.

25:10.834 --> 25:11.817
CLAIRE:
I know, seriously,

25:11.897 --> 25:13.329
she's so crazy and paranoid.

25:13.408 --> 25:15.696
And she says I can't
go back on to Friend Section

25:15.744 --> 25:17.553
for six months.

25:18.056 --> 25:19.351
I told her it
was all your fault,

25:19.441 --> 25:21.441
you told me to trick the guy
in the first place.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.863
But she didn't-- I did!

25:22.927 --> 25:24.079
She didn't even care.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.359
She said, "The world is full
of predators

25:26.420 --> 25:29.101
and it's best not to go around
trying to piss them off."

25:31.589 --> 25:33.381
Ah, the magic hour.

25:33.477 --> 25:34.581
Listen, I gotta close up.

25:34.677 --> 25:35.772
Can I call you later?

25:36.389 --> 25:37.885
Okay. Bye.

25:53.596 --> 25:55.017
MAN:
Hi. Hey.

25:55.078 --> 25:58.260
Uh... can you open
the door, please?

26:00.276 --> 26:01.824
Yeah, no-no, I know
you're closed,

26:01.873 --> 26:03.092
but I'm not here to shop, uh...

26:03.834 --> 26:05.700
You must be Claire, right?

26:06.389 --> 26:07.796
Is your mom in there?

26:07.850 --> 26:09.528
Because I-I, um...
I really need

26:09.602 --> 26:11.433
to talk to her.
Hey, cut that out!

26:12.231 --> 26:14.247
Oh, no-no. It's okay, um...

26:14.487 --> 26:15.951
Just go get your mom, all right?

26:16.048 --> 26:18.474
And tell her to open
the door and talk to me.

26:18.574 --> 26:20.695
Huh?
I know who you are, you know.

26:20.767 --> 26:22.577
And she doesn't want to see you.

26:23.616 --> 26:24.893
What do you mean?

26:25.998 --> 26:27.918
What did she tell you?

26:28.454 --> 26:29.951
(banging)
Where is she?

26:31.117 --> 26:32.013
No, hey!

26:32.094 --> 26:33.334
Hey, no, no, no, no.

26:33.452 --> 26:36.404
Hey! Hey!
(banging on door continues)

26:43.955 --> 26:46.856
Mommy, I wanted the puffy ones.

26:46.943 --> 26:48.170
These are the puffy ones.

26:48.265 --> 26:49.736
They're plenty puffy.

26:52.279 --> 26:53.594
All right,
go get the puffy ones,

26:53.674 --> 26:54.772
I'll eat these.

26:54.797 --> 26:56.050
Thanks, Mommy.

26:56.602 --> 26:57.537
How about you?

26:57.595 --> 26:58.759
Are you all right?

27:00.095 --> 27:01.224
You happy?

27:01.312 --> 27:02.774
Happy!

27:02.951 --> 27:04.191
Glad to hear it.

27:11.353 --> 27:13.165
Ariel...

27:13.861 --> 27:14.909
I saw him.

27:16.004 --> 27:17.832
I saw the killer.

27:27.253 --> 27:28.514
I can't believe
you think it's a good idea

27:28.603 --> 27:30.168
to bring our daughter
down to the police station

27:30.266 --> 27:31.673
to work with a sketch artist.

27:31.754 --> 27:33.713
Believe me, I'd have
given anything

27:33.786 --> 27:35.048
to have had Ariel's dream.

27:35.169 --> 27:37.516
But for some reason,
it seems like I'm
getting dreams

27:37.552 --> 27:40.664
from Patty, and Ariel's
getting dreams from Claire.

27:40.799 --> 27:43.239
And, for some reason,
I don't know,

27:43.303 --> 27:45.207
it seems like they have
very different ideas

27:45.264 --> 27:47.199
about who might
have done it.
Well, how can that be?

27:47.220 --> 27:49.719
They were both killed
by the same person.
I don't know, Joe.

27:50.407 --> 27:51.606
(spits)
Maybe because
they're deaths

27:51.679 --> 27:53.406
were so sudden, so violent;

27:53.878 --> 27:55.173
maybe because one
or both of them

27:55.241 --> 27:57.357
didn't literally
see who did it.

27:57.558 --> 27:59.301
Well, that's all
well and good,

27:59.418 --> 28:02.365
but our oldest child is
clearly taking no pleasure

28:02.459 --> 28:05.277
in being the go-between
in all this.
I know that.

28:05.877 --> 28:06.877
I'll try to make
it as quick

28:06.933 --> 28:08.405
and painless
as possible.

28:08.912 --> 28:10.147
She's not gonna be alone.

28:10.244 --> 28:12.050
I'll be with her the
whole time, which I'm sure

28:12.123 --> 28:14.427
will be a great
comfort to her.

28:20.218 --> 28:22.417
She has to forgive
me sometime, right?

28:22.954 --> 28:24.481
She has to.

28:30.608 --> 28:32.503
He had a longer nose.

28:32.608 --> 28:34.984
You know, pointier.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.926
Like... Jim Carrey
in that movie.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.742
(laughs):
Longer and pointier.

28:41.598 --> 28:43.301
Got it.

28:43.439 --> 28:44.814
Ladies.

28:45.169 --> 28:46.214
Wayne, can I steal

28:46.269 --> 28:47.639
Mrs. Dubois
for a moment?

28:49.708 --> 28:52.198
Go on, Mom. I'm fine.

28:56.883 --> 28:58.589
Tell me this is about a lead.

28:59.251 --> 29:00.658
This has to do with a lead.

29:00.795 --> 29:02.602
Two, in fact.
I spoke with
the president

29:02.698 --> 29:04.519
of Friend Section,
and as long as we have

29:04.588 --> 29:06.119
the appropriate paperwork,
he's willing to help us

29:06.192 --> 29:08.783
identify the person
who threatened
Claire Chase online.

29:09.128 --> 29:12.343
We should have Shred182's
name and address by
the end of the day.

29:12.503 --> 29:13.583
And this morning,
we got a call

29:13.640 --> 29:15.943
from one of the merchants
in Chase's strip mall

29:16.006 --> 29:18.061
about something he
saw Saturday night.

29:18.646 --> 29:19.935
Apparently,
around 6:00,

29:19.958 --> 29:23.197
he heard some
tires squealing in
the parking lot.

29:23.287 --> 29:25.934
When he looked out
his window, he saw
a car speeding away,

29:26.085 --> 29:27.717
made a note of the
plate and called us.

29:27.820 --> 29:29.948
The police traced the number
to a man named Ben Radley.

29:29.989 --> 29:32.043
Mr. Radley admits
that he knew Patty Cse,

29:32.100 --> 29:34.403
and claims he was a good friend
of her late husband's.

29:34.499 --> 29:36.860
Said he took her
out for a cup of
coffee on Saturday,

29:36.939 --> 29:38.971
but that she was
alive when he left.

29:39.541 --> 29:40.827
He insists he
would never, ever

29:40.909 --> 29:42.577
hurt the wife of
his dead friend.

29:42.696 --> 29:44.239
And then I asked if he'd ever
sleep with the wife

29:44.313 --> 29:46.329
of his dead friend--
things got real quiet.

29:47.182 --> 29:49.071
Mr. Radley's a married man.

29:49.263 --> 29:50.767
Patty's secret boyfriend.

29:52.799 --> 29:54.190
You think Ariel would
be up for taking

29:54.246 --> 29:55.694
a gander at the
guy in person,

29:55.778 --> 29:57.709
let us know if he's the
man from her dream?

29:58.407 --> 29:59.557
I don't know.

29:59.654 --> 30:00.956
It would help us

30:01.014 --> 30:03.197
to at least know if we're
on the right track.

30:12.467 --> 30:14.957
I need to see his face.

30:24.569 --> 30:25.810
That's not him.

30:26.921 --> 30:28.535
No, I'm not discouraged.

30:30.129 --> 30:32.496
All right, tomorrow then.

30:33.088 --> 30:34.865
Bridge,  honey,
it's time for bed.

30:35.272 --> 30:37.064
Okay, Mommy.

30:41.919 --> 30:43.494
So what was that?

30:43.607 --> 30:45.469
Claire's online stalker.

30:45.567 --> 30:47.614
Turned out to be
a 15-year-old kid

30:47.718 --> 30:50.238
who had an alibi
for Saturday night.

30:50.517 --> 30:53.454
And apparently, Patty's
married boyfriend

30:53.493 --> 30:54.727
has never owned a firearm.

30:54.791 --> 30:56.425
So we're back at square one.

30:57.524 --> 30:59.238
Can you tell Ariel
it's time for bed?

30:59.309 --> 31:01.773
Last time I knocked,
she told me to go away.

31:01.908 --> 31:04.020
Mmm, she's upset.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.876
I know she's upset.

31:05.956 --> 31:07.605
She's upset, I'm upset.

31:07.643 --> 31:09.388
It's been a lousy week.

31:10.332 --> 31:12.148
Can you please just tell her?

31:19.897 --> 31:20.858
Who is it?

31:20.977 --> 31:22.113
It's Dad.

31:22.676 --> 31:24.497
Oh. Come in.

31:27.473 --> 31:29.489
Your mom wanted me to tell you
it's time for bed.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.096
Gee, I can't wait.

31:31.183 --> 31:33.072
Oh, boy, maybe I'll have
another scary dream

31:33.152 --> 31:34.807
about killers who don't exist.

31:35.176 --> 31:36.344
Yeah, you might.

31:37.672 --> 31:40.688
But then you're going to
wake up, calm yourself down,

31:40.765 --> 31:42.735
because you know that
it's just a dream,

31:43.278 --> 31:44.487
and you're going to be okay.

31:45.062 --> 31:47.878
And after that you're
going to go the bathroom,

31:47.962 --> 31:49.697
and you're going to brush
your beautiful blonde hair,

31:49.766 --> 31:52.004
which, along with this
propensity for bad dreams,

31:52.062 --> 31:53.830
you also got
from your mother.

31:55.213 --> 31:56.389
And then, when you're
through with that,

31:56.470 --> 31:57.835
you're going
to go to school,

31:57.911 --> 32:00.053
where you're going
to apply your natural

32:00.316 --> 32:04.699
inquisitiveness to whatever is
happening in that classroom.

32:05.586 --> 32:06.476
And when you do that,

32:06.556 --> 32:09.530
I want you to keep in mind that
that comes from your mom, too.

32:11.226 --> 32:14.538
But listen, it doesn't
matter what I say.

32:14.649 --> 32:16.314
You're going to do
whatever you're going to do,

32:16.405 --> 32:18.498
and you're going to feel
whatever you're going to feel.

32:18.580 --> 32:21.216
You're going to stay
mad at your mom

32:21.296 --> 32:24.240
for as long as you feel
like staying mad at your mom.

32:24.399 --> 32:26.175
And you know
how I know that?

32:26.215 --> 32:28.199
Because that's
pure Mom, too.

32:29.639 --> 32:31.759
It's all the same
bundle, honey.

32:32.614 --> 32:35.206
It's all in the same
wonderful bundle.

32:37.758 --> 32:39.621
Give me a kiss.

32:48.093 --> 32:49.331
Good night, Daddy.

32:49.420 --> 32:50.979
Good night, sweetheart.

33:06.121 --> 33:06.968
I don't know.

33:07.060 --> 33:08.438
She just locked the door.

33:08.794 --> 33:10.194
She's back there
with someone.

33:10.290 --> 33:11.202
I think it's her boyfriend,

33:11.323 --> 33:13.313
who she told me she
dumped two days ago.

33:15.064 --> 33:16.559
I... I don't
want this, Ben.

33:17.144 --> 33:18.295
I got to call you back.

33:19.911 --> 33:21.032
Mom?

33:21.139 --> 33:22.110
Are you okay?

33:23.039 --> 33:24.055
I'm fine, honey.

33:25.174 --> 33:26.614
I'll...
I'll just be a second.

33:28.374 --> 33:29.935
I want you to have it.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.717
My daughter is working,
and you shouldn't be here.

33:32.822 --> 33:34.340
I'm gonna leave, Alana.

33:34.405 --> 33:37.477
I know I said that before,
but I'm serious this time.

33:37.620 --> 33:38.675
We can be together.

33:38.757 --> 33:40.364
We can go out in public.
No.

33:41.203 --> 33:42.674
Now, I have said this before.

33:42.715 --> 33:45.634
This... what...
this thing-- us--

33:45.708 --> 33:47.298
it's-it's-it's
an indiscretion,

33:47.354 --> 33:48.482
it's-it's
a lapse of judgment.

33:48.538 --> 33:50.578
It was never going
to be permanent.

33:51.363 --> 33:55.402
Ben... I don't want you
to leave your family.

33:59.497 --> 34:01.472
And I don't want this.

34:03.288 --> 34:05.158
What about what I want?

34:07.096 --> 34:08.862
Mom, open the door!

34:09.569 --> 34:11.119
Open the door!

34:11.226 --> 34:12.551
Claire.

34:14.405 --> 34:16.399
I'm okay, honey.

34:16.501 --> 34:18.270
You just watch the store.

34:20.839 --> 34:22.380
Claire.

34:23.226 --> 34:24.427
Have you got a minute
to talk to me?

34:24.522 --> 34:26.723
I mean, you're not closing
up or anything, right?

34:28.172 --> 34:29.531
Yeah, we're still open.

34:29.621 --> 34:30.751
I'm sorry about yesterday.

34:30.833 --> 34:31.981
I thought you
were someone else.

34:32.077 --> 34:33.498
No, no, it's fine, um...

34:33.594 --> 34:35.833
I wanted to talk to you
about my fiancee.

34:35.885 --> 34:38.010
She, she, uh, she came
in here on Wednesday

34:38.085 --> 34:39.552
and she returned a dress,

34:39.808 --> 34:41.768
a wedding dress.

34:42.161 --> 34:43.176
She was going to wear it

34:43.264 --> 34:45.159
to our wedding,
tonight, in fact.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.447
We were going to
be married... tonight.

34:47.536 --> 34:49.222
Do you remember that dress?

34:49.313 --> 34:50.424
Kind of.

34:50.815 --> 34:52.471
Yeah, sure.

34:53.311 --> 34:54.735
Well, see, you know,
the thing is, Claire,

34:54.835 --> 34:56.241
that means you've
seen my fiancee

34:56.279 --> 34:58.142
more recently than I have.

34:58.374 --> 35:00.320
See, she left my place
on Tuesday night,

35:00.421 --> 35:01.726
and I haven't heard
from her since.

35:01.828 --> 35:04.326
And her mother, her mother's
not telling me anything.

35:04.437 --> 35:06.776
So the only thing
that I know for sure,

35:07.009 --> 35:09.787
is that this is the last
place she visited right here:

35:10.018 --> 35:13.355
Your Perfect... Day

35:14.124 --> 35:15.594
Dress Shop.

35:15.995 --> 35:18.642
Oh, I like it-- you know,
the name and everything.

35:18.738 --> 35:20.545
It's-it's cute,
it's uh...

35:20.908 --> 35:23.329
charming,
but I've got to tell you,

35:23.394 --> 35:25.276
I don't think it fits right now.

35:25.681 --> 35:28.992
Because my day has been
anything but perfect.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.711
In fact, my day
has pretty much sucked,

35:31.831 --> 35:33.032
just like yesterday.

35:33.135 --> 35:34.743
Monday pretty much bit,

35:34.872 --> 35:36.959
and tomorrow's not
looking good either.

35:37.373 --> 35:38.679
I don't know
what to tell you.

35:38.798 --> 35:40.655
I only talked to her
for, like, a minute.

35:40.784 --> 35:44.663
Well, a lot can happen in
a minute, though, right?

35:45.238 --> 35:47.644
What I want to know,
Claire, is when you

35:47.764 --> 35:50.133
were helping my fiancee,

35:50.989 --> 35:53.084
did she give you a hint,

35:53.644 --> 35:57.485
a clue as to where she
might have been headed?

35:57.975 --> 35:58.980
No, I'm sorry,

35:59.060 --> 36:01.731
she just dropped off
the dress and left.

36:03.699 --> 36:05.530
Did she happen to mention

36:05.611 --> 36:07.962
why she decided to end
a three-year relationship

36:08.037 --> 36:09.878
without so much
as a phone call?

36:09.974 --> 36:11.222
Don't call me!

36:11.309 --> 36:13.211
Nothing? Nothing
at all? No hint.

36:13.372 --> 36:16.977
No. Maybe you scared her.

36:17.712 --> 36:20.722
Or maybe she just figured
she'd finally bled me dry.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.433
You can't take blood
from a stone, Claire.

36:24.513 --> 36:26.928
Are you familiar
with that expression?

36:33.879 --> 36:35.174
Damn it, that's my car!

36:35.454 --> 36:36.951
Hey! Hey, stop!

36:37.047 --> 36:38.119
That's my car!

36:38.502 --> 36:40.326
Hey! Hey!

36:50.604 --> 36:52.109
Mom! You better
come out here!

36:52.181 --> 36:54.231
This guy is
completely losing it!

36:54.276 --> 36:56.100
You, hey!
Did you see what happened?

36:56.468 --> 36:59.563
Hey, lady, did you
get a license plate number?

37:23.866 --> 37:25.195
Mom!

37:25.298 --> 37:26.537
Oh, my God, Mom?

37:26.641 --> 37:28.471
Mom! Mom!

37:28.545 --> 37:32.335
Mom! Mom! Open the door!

37:32.648 --> 37:33.304
Please.

37:33.410 --> 37:34.529
Mom!

37:34.784 --> 37:36.126
Please, don't.

37:37.728 --> 37:39.254
Please, don't.

37:39.346 --> 37:40.703
Mom.

38:04.234 --> 38:07.299
So let me get this straight.

38:07.378 --> 38:10.203
You were both wrong,
and you were both right?

38:10.355 --> 38:12.154
Well, Ariel misunderstood

38:12.237 --> 38:13.344
what Claire was
trying to show her,

38:13.426 --> 38:16.440
just like I misunderstood what
Patty was trying to show me.

38:16.578 --> 38:19.822
The dreams they were sending us
weren't about the boyfriend

38:19.847 --> 38:20.918
or the guy on the Internet.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.802
They were about
the jilted fiancee.

38:24.265 --> 38:26.683
We just didn't realize it,
until we compared notes.

38:26.790 --> 38:27.688
Got it.

38:27.933 --> 38:28.558
I think.

38:28.678 --> 38:30.461
Each of you is only
getting half the story.

38:30.568 --> 38:31.621
If anyone wants the whole story,

38:31.721 --> 38:33.836
I've got Mr. Wallaby
in the interrogation room.

38:34.690 --> 38:35.923
I know what he looks like.

38:35.992 --> 38:37.239
I can do this without
you, if you like.

38:37.311 --> 38:40.813
No, I want to be there.

38:41.388 --> 38:42.699
Okay.

38:52.873 --> 38:54.099
That's him.

38:54.705 --> 38:56.122
That's him.

38:56.218 --> 38:57.642
Okay.

39:15.655 --> 39:16.758
Claire?

39:19.638 --> 39:20.871
Wait!

39:26.853 --> 39:27.981
Hey, there.

39:28.709 --> 39:30.181
Oh, Wyatt.

39:30.539 --> 39:31.788
I was...

39:32.285 --> 39:33.805
looking for someone.

39:34.052 --> 39:35.940
That's funny, 'cause I
was looking for you.

39:36.892 --> 39:37.915
You were?

39:39.275 --> 39:40.579
Well, I was wondering
if you wanted to go

39:40.636 --> 39:41.875
to the Spring Fling with me.

39:41.932 --> 39:44.773
I know it's kind of last minute,
and if you say no, it's okay.

39:44.865 --> 39:47.115
No. I mean, yes.

39:47.169 --> 39:49.913
It's just... I don't
have anything to wear.

39:50.121 --> 39:52.185
Well, wear what you have on.

39:52.522 --> 39:53.849
You look great.

39:57.329 --> 39:59.904
So, it's a date, right?

40:00.424 --> 40:01.384
Yeah.

40:01.616 --> 40:02.795
It's a date.

40:02.979 --> 40:04.214
Cool.

40:12.575 --> 40:15.342
Ladies and gentlemen,
the king and queen

40:15.415 --> 40:17.238
of the Bates Middle School
Spring Fling--

40:17.303 --> 40:20.854
I give you Wyatt Forrester
and Ariel Dubois.

40:58.553 --> 40:59.623
You okay?

40:59.700 --> 41:01.000
Is she home yet?

41:01.727 --> 41:05.071
Baby, she just left
an hour and a half ago.

41:06.727 --> 41:08.135
You're not worried, are you?

41:08.215 --> 41:11.023
Mm. Not even a little bit.
