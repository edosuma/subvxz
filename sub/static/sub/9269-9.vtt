00:32.597 --> 00:33.637
Get up!

00:35.557 --> 00:37.156
What time is it?

00:37.157 --> 00:40.397
Time you did some work.
Lying around like a useless lump!

00:41.637 --> 00:44.396
Sorry, Dad. I don't feel well.

00:44.397 --> 00:46.997
You think I take the day off
when I feel poorly?

00:48.157 --> 00:49.317
Feeble little runt!

00:53.637 --> 00:55.797
Look at you. Pathetic!

00:57.917 --> 00:59.756
You're meant to be a man!

00:59.757 --> 01:03.637
But what did I expect?
You take after your mother.

01:05.837 --> 01:07.276
What did you say?

01:07.277 --> 01:08.916
You heard.

01:08.917 --> 01:10.997
You're just like your mother.

01:18.957 --> 01:21.916
I'm nothing like my mother!

01:21.917 --> 01:25.117
Pathetic, am I? A little runt?
Get off me!

01:26.517 --> 01:28.717
Why should I?
Now who's the feeble one?

01:34.117 --> 01:36.516
Things are going to change around
here, Dad.

01:36.517 --> 01:38.117
Things are going to change!

02:09.396 --> 02:11.276
Mrs McCarthy. Honestly!

02:11.277 --> 02:15.316
I go away for one week and when
I come back, what do I find?

02:15.317 --> 02:16.716
Chaos!

02:16.717 --> 02:19.116
That is a slight exaggeration.

02:19.117 --> 02:23.036
Ooh, has someone done the Mass
lists or the bidding prayers

02:23.037 --> 02:24.876
or written up the weekly collection?

02:24.877 --> 02:26.956
There have been
slips in administration.

02:26.957 --> 02:29.037
Slips? It's a complete landslide!

02:30.237 --> 02:33.717
And who on earth is
responsible for that?

02:36.317 --> 02:39.436
We decided to let
Mrs Tindall have a turn.

02:39.437 --> 02:41.396
She's been waiting for a very,
very long time.

02:41.397 --> 02:46.596
I am very, very well aware!
Look at that foliage.

02:46.597 --> 02:47.637
It's half-dead!

02:52.197 --> 02:54.316
Who would have thought
flower arranging could be

02:54.317 --> 02:55.916
so dangerous?

02:55.917 --> 02:58.236
I think it was the eryngium
that got me.

02:58.237 --> 03:00.876
What? Sea holly?

03:00.877 --> 03:02.316
Oh.

03:02.317 --> 03:04.796
Well, you take the eye drops
three times a day,

03:04.797 --> 03:07.557
and my wife will make you an
appointment to have the stitches out.

03:08.637 --> 03:12.196
Are you all right,
Mrs McCarthy? Yes, fine.

03:12.197 --> 03:14.517
Well... I'm still a bit shaken.

03:15.637 --> 03:18.197
Now you know why
I don't have flowers in the surgery.

03:19.397 --> 03:21.877
Although I do have one very
beautiful rose.

03:24.117 --> 03:26.636
So, when would be convenient
for you?

03:26.637 --> 03:29.957
I suppose I could do any
morning except Tuesday.

03:31.237 --> 03:33.437
Nine o'clock, Tuesday.

03:34.917 --> 03:38.036
I said any morning except Tuesday!

03:38.037 --> 03:39.876
Um... Sorry!

03:39.877 --> 03:40.996
Tuesday afternoon?

03:40.997 --> 03:45.397
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Am I surrounded by incompetence?

03:48.397 --> 03:49.957
Oona? Oona?

03:51.037 --> 03:52.076
I'm sorry.

03:52.077 --> 03:55.796
No, no. I'm sorry.
What's the matter?

03:55.797 --> 03:56.836
It's nothing.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.437
No, it's not nothing.
Just look at the state you're in.

04:01.237 --> 04:02.277
It's just...

04:04.517 --> 04:06.437
..I think I'm going to have a baby.

04:10.157 --> 04:12.637
Come on! Come on! Move!

04:16.837 --> 04:17.957
Must stop smoking.

04:24.317 --> 04:26.636
Traditionally, Sid,
shouldn't you be inside the car?

04:26.637 --> 04:27.916
That's very funny.

04:27.917 --> 04:30.996
I've been saying to Lady F we should
get this serviced for weeks.

04:30.997 --> 04:36.836
Does she listen? Mind you,
only 200 yards to the garage.

04:36.837 --> 04:38.476
I will share your load.

04:38.477 --> 04:39.956
Ah, would ya?

04:39.957 --> 04:43.916
Right, I'll steer. Right, you ready?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.637
One, two... What?

05:01.437 --> 05:04.197
That was Alfred. You know,
Farmer Tatton's son?

05:05.717 --> 05:08.997
Well, if he carries on riding like
that, he won't be for much longer.

05:12.157 --> 05:13.676
'What did he say?'

05:13.677 --> 05:15.277
I haven't told him.

05:16.997 --> 05:20.516
Why on earth not?
He's a doctor, for heaven's sake!

05:20.517 --> 05:22.196
It's just...

05:22.197 --> 05:24.677
Last year, I lost a baby.

05:26.357 --> 05:27.397
Oh.

05:28.557 --> 05:32.836
And afterwards, the doctors said
I could never have another.

05:32.837 --> 05:36.436
Adam was sad,
so perhaps it was a blessing.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.396
He's too old for a family.

05:38.397 --> 05:40.636
Oh, he may have said that,

05:40.637 --> 05:45.756
but I've known him since before you
were... Well, for a very long time.

05:45.757 --> 05:47.796
And he is the kindest of men.

05:47.797 --> 05:50.196
I'm sure he'll be
thrilled at your news.

05:50.197 --> 05:51.796
I've tried to tell him,
but recently,

05:51.797 --> 05:53.756
he just seems so distracted.

05:53.757 --> 05:55.756
He's a very busy man.

05:55.757 --> 05:57.316
I know,

05:57.317 --> 06:00.996
but please, don't tell
anyone till I know for sure.

06:00.997 --> 06:03.477
I am the soul of discretion.

06:05.997 --> 06:08.717
Though I may have to start knitting!

06:11.837 --> 06:14.476
Excuse me! You're excused.

06:14.477 --> 06:15.876
What do you want?

06:15.877 --> 06:18.037
Isn't it obvious, Oona?

06:20.037 --> 06:21.997
Alfred wanted to see you.

06:22.997 --> 06:25.917
Right, well,
you'd better come through.

06:32.197 --> 06:34.876
So, what seems to be the trouble?

06:34.877 --> 06:36.237
Well, I need some painkillers.

06:37.237 --> 06:39.596
And where's the pain this time?

06:39.597 --> 06:42.236
It's the headaches.
They're all the time now,

06:42.237 --> 06:45.516
like someone's banging
a hammer on my skull.

06:45.517 --> 06:46.677
Look, Alfred.

06:48.197 --> 06:50.836
I do have to be careful about
how many of these I prescribe.

06:50.837 --> 06:51.877
I'm in agony here.

06:55.077 --> 06:57.956
I think we both know what you could
do to reduce the headaches.

06:57.957 --> 06:59.436
Give it to me!

06:59.437 --> 07:01.076
All I'm saying is that certain
actions

07:01.077 --> 07:02.476
have inevitable consequences.

07:02.477 --> 07:04.396
What, like if you marry
a woman half your age,

07:04.397 --> 07:06.677
then she'll run off
with somebody else?

07:08.957 --> 07:11.596
Let's just stick to your health
problems, shall we?

07:11.597 --> 07:14.797
Don't bother. I reckon you've got
enough problems of your own.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.437
Alfred! Alfred, wait!

07:24.437 --> 07:26.397
I don't know how you put up with
that old fool.

07:27.717 --> 07:30.236
You want to spend some time
with a real man.

07:30.237 --> 07:31.476
Come see me at the barn.

07:31.477 --> 07:33.636
Not today. Not tomorrow.

07:33.637 --> 07:34.677
Never!

07:38.317 --> 07:39.357
I'll see you later.

07:43.877 --> 07:44.916
Adam?

07:44.917 --> 07:47.197
That boy gets more like his father
every day.

07:48.357 --> 07:49.756
Do you fancy some lunch?

07:49.757 --> 07:52.717
No. I've, um,
got some errands to do.

07:59.757 --> 08:02.917
Now, about these annual reports...

08:05.277 --> 08:06.317
Don't say it.

08:07.437 --> 08:08.477
Say what, Mrs M?

08:09.957 --> 08:14.196
That I...
That I look like Lord Nelson.

08:14.197 --> 08:15.877
I was going say Long John Silver.

08:18.597 --> 08:20.036
Pay no attention.

08:20.037 --> 08:24.036
I'm sure Dr Crawford did
an excellent job with your stitches.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.476
He did.

08:25.477 --> 08:28.396
Do you know, he spent ten minutes
looking for the right

08:28.397 --> 08:31.476
shade of thread to match my eyebrows?

08:31.477 --> 08:33.196
How very meticulous.

08:33.197 --> 08:36.395
And then I bumped into Alfred Tatton
at the surgery.

08:36.397 --> 08:39.716
He is turning into a very
unpleasant young man.

08:39.717 --> 08:42.797
Mm... He does seem to be
a lost soul.

08:44.477 --> 08:46.116
You lost something, Mrs M?

08:46.117 --> 08:50.276
Oh, I left my eye drops at the
surgery. Well, it'll have to wait.

08:50.277 --> 08:52.756
Now, about these annual reports,

08:52.757 --> 08:55.396
which you have done no
work on whatsoever.

08:55.397 --> 08:57.636
Yes, well, that sounds
like a marvellous idea,

08:57.637 --> 09:01.676
but I did promise to speak to
Mr Sims about the Bishop's visit.

09:01.677 --> 09:02.797
Mm. What?

09:04.317 --> 09:07.716
And I could pick your eye drops
up on the way over.

09:07.717 --> 09:09.076
It's a good idea.

09:09.077 --> 09:10.117
But...

09:11.437 --> 09:12.677
I think we need...

09:22.917 --> 09:24.796
Oh, you were a while.

09:24.797 --> 09:26.956
I ran into Mrs Gillespie.

09:26.957 --> 09:29.156
You know what a chatterbox she is.

09:29.157 --> 09:30.796
Are we going for lunch?

09:30.797 --> 09:34.956
Ah, well, Mrs McCarthy forgot
her eye drops,

09:34.957 --> 09:39.276
but before that, I'd better give
Alfred his prescription.

09:39.277 --> 09:40.317
Right.

09:43.237 --> 09:45.196
I'll be as quick as I can.

09:45.197 --> 09:48.917
I tell you what. Why don't
we take a picnic up to Tawny Lake?

09:55.277 --> 09:57.396
Oh, Father! Oona!

09:57.397 --> 09:58.676
I'm looking for eye drops.

09:58.677 --> 10:01.076
I think Mrs McCarthy may have
mislaid them.

10:01.077 --> 10:03.036
Oh, my husband's just
gone off with them.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.076
Really? Where to?

10:04.077 --> 10:05.516
Tatton Farm.

10:05.517 --> 10:08.596
Well, it's not too far.
Try and catch him.

10:08.597 --> 10:10.797
And I can have a word with
young Alfred.

10:12.637 --> 10:14.036
Everything all right?

10:14.037 --> 10:15.757
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

10:18.837 --> 10:19.997
Everything's fine.

10:36.997 --> 10:38.037
Mind my bike!

10:57.437 --> 10:58.477
Alfred?

11:09.357 --> 11:10.477
No! No!

11:35.917 --> 11:38.636
Father Brown. Everything all right?

11:38.637 --> 11:41.157
No. Everything is not all right.

11:46.557 --> 11:48.757
That'll do for now.
Thank you, Doctor.

11:52.077 --> 11:54.636
I don't know how this could
have happened.

11:54.637 --> 11:56.157
What a terrible accident.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.077
Yes. It must have been.

12:01.357 --> 12:03.357
These machines are so unreliable.

12:06.477 --> 12:08.437
I'm sure there'll be a full
investigation.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.956
He was such a good boy, you know.

12:11.957 --> 12:13.237
Couldn't do enough for me.

12:15.437 --> 12:19.757
Maybe God took him
because he was short of angels.

12:24.797 --> 12:26.596
Inspector? Father Brown.

12:26.597 --> 12:27.916
Isn't it interesting?

12:27.917 --> 12:31.356
Whenever there's a suspicious death,
you're never far away.

12:31.357 --> 12:33.636
Does the Grim Reaper give you
advance warning?

12:33.637 --> 12:35.036
I don't want to step on your toes.

12:35.037 --> 12:36.596
Obviously.

12:36.597 --> 12:39.716
But why do you consider this
death suspicious?

12:39.717 --> 12:42.397
Several reasons.
One of which, Alfred fell backwards.

12:43.397 --> 12:46.516
But if he'd been loading the machine,
he would have been facing forwards.

12:46.517 --> 12:49.156
It's difficult to believe that
an experienced operator would

12:49.157 --> 12:50.236
suddenly fall in,

12:50.237 --> 12:53.276
whereas it's very easy
indeed for him to be pushed.

12:53.277 --> 12:55.036
So what brought you to Tatton Farm?

12:55.037 --> 12:57.276
I wanted to catch Dr Crawford,
but his wife said

12:57.277 --> 13:00.316
he'd already left for Tatton Farm,
so I came after him.

13:00.317 --> 13:02.196
Interesting.

13:02.197 --> 13:03.516
What is?

13:03.517 --> 13:04.876
You both made the same journey,

13:04.877 --> 13:07.756
but you went by bicycle
and the doctor came by car.

13:07.757 --> 13:10.677
So how did you manage to
get here first?

13:13.957 --> 13:15.836
Just double check all of that.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.637
Thank you for your time.
We'll be in touch.

13:30.597 --> 13:34.476
And if you ever need to talk, the
door of St Mary's is always open.

13:34.477 --> 13:35.516
Thank you, Father.

13:35.517 --> 13:38.796
Because I was a surprised when you
described your son as an angel.

13:38.797 --> 13:42.676
I know, in the past, you said that
living with him was a trial.

13:42.677 --> 13:46.156
We had our ups and downs,
but he were a good boy.

13:46.157 --> 13:49.716
I prefer to concentrate
on the happy memories.

13:49.717 --> 13:52.596
What was your last memory of Alfred?

13:52.597 --> 13:53.637
What?

13:55.517 --> 13:56.957
When did you last see him?

13:57.957 --> 14:00.957
I need to lie down, Father.
Good day to you.

14:05.037 --> 14:06.276
'It's awful.'

14:06.277 --> 14:07.717
What do they think happened?

14:08.837 --> 14:10.436
It was an accident.

14:10.437 --> 14:11.476
Of course.

14:11.477 --> 14:13.476
He fell.

14:13.477 --> 14:18.277
It would have been very quick.
I mean, I don't think he suffered.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.596
Er... There's just one thing
I must do.

14:21.597 --> 14:25.157
Adam, there's just something I've
been meaning to tell you.

14:26.717 --> 14:27.996
What?

14:27.997 --> 14:29.037
Dr Crawford.

14:30.117 --> 14:31.157
Can we have a word?

14:33.397 --> 14:36.476
So, you went straight
from the surgery to the barn?

14:36.477 --> 14:40.676
That's right. I parked round
the corner in Lovage Lane.

14:40.677 --> 14:43.756
These country roads play havoc
with your suspension.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.156
Mm.

14:45.157 --> 14:47.156
I'd say that's a two-minute journey.

14:47.157 --> 14:50.197
And yet, you're unaccounted for,
for nearly ten.

14:51.877 --> 14:54.637
Well, I may have stopped
somewhere along the way.

14:55.717 --> 14:56.756
Really?

14:56.757 --> 15:00.157
Actually, yes. I think
I did stop to admire the lavender.

15:01.157 --> 15:02.196
Is that so?

15:02.197 --> 15:04.996
It's rather magnificent
this time of year.

15:04.997 --> 15:06.036
Hm.

15:06.037 --> 15:08.556
What time was this exactly?

15:08.557 --> 15:09.597
Well, er...

15:10.917 --> 15:14.476
Quarter past, 12.20. Does it matter?

15:14.477 --> 15:16.556
I'd say it does matter.

15:16.557 --> 15:19.236
John Tatton has just
lost his only son.

15:19.237 --> 15:24.236
Yes. Yes, he's had such a terrible
run of tragedies.

15:24.237 --> 15:26.837
He must constantly be asking
himself, why me?

15:29.597 --> 15:31.276
Mm.

15:31.277 --> 15:35.116
You know, if I had to name anyone,
I'd go for John Tatton. Would you?

15:35.117 --> 15:36.916
Such a cruel man!

15:36.917 --> 15:40.156
He never seemed able to look his son
straight in the eye.

15:40.157 --> 15:42.157
Bit late for the post,
isn't it, Mrs M?

15:44.877 --> 15:46.117
There's no name on it.

15:52.557 --> 15:57.116
"Alfred Tatton was
killed by Dr Crawford." No!

15:57.117 --> 15:58.957
Who could have written such a thing?

16:01.357 --> 16:02.397
Who indeed?

16:07.517 --> 16:09.876
Inspector, did you want to see me?

16:09.877 --> 16:12.597
Always a pleasure, Father,
but no, I'm here for the funeral.

16:13.957 --> 16:18.516
Have you seen these? Several dozen
letters, sent all over town.

16:18.517 --> 16:19.996
We're looking into who sent them

16:19.997 --> 16:23.076
and the possibility
that it could be true.

16:23.077 --> 16:24.397
Sid? Sid?

16:26.877 --> 16:29.677
I want you to try every
typewriter in Kembleford.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.356
The library, village shop, school.

16:33.357 --> 16:38.476
Even the one Mrs McCarthy uses. And
see if you can find a match for this.

16:38.477 --> 16:40.236
Why do I get all the boring jobs?

16:40.237 --> 16:43.396
Because it is vital
that we find the author.

16:43.397 --> 16:45.637
They're called poison pen
letters for a reason.

16:55.637 --> 16:58.516
Mr Tatton... My condolences.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.756
You're very kind, Mrs McCarthy,

17:00.757 --> 17:04.556
but the best thing in my life
has been taken away from me.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.156
Of course. If you'll excuse me.

17:09.156 --> 17:10.196
Oona!

17:11.357 --> 17:14.715
Don't you know its bad luck to come
to a funeral in your condition?

17:14.717 --> 17:18.036
Sh! I don't want anyone to know.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.156
You still haven't told?

17:20.156 --> 17:22.236
It just never seems the right time.

17:22.237 --> 17:23.915
And now these awful letters!

17:23.916 --> 17:27.036
Oh, you shouldn't pay a blind
bit of notice to them.

17:27.037 --> 17:28.076
Nobody else has.

17:28.077 --> 17:30.116
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.996
And where is your husband?

17:31.997 --> 17:33.317
I don't know. Amen.

17:41.237 --> 17:44.796
I'm so, so very sorry. You're drunk!

17:44.797 --> 17:46.316
Drunk? Of course I'm not drunk!

17:46.317 --> 17:49.596
Showing up at my son's funeral
in that state! It's disrespectful!

17:49.597 --> 17:52.436
Well, your son was hardly the most
respectful of people.

17:52.437 --> 17:53.677
How dare you!

17:55.917 --> 17:58.036
You seen this? Hm? What is it?

17:58.037 --> 18:00.517
I think you know.
It's true, isn't it?

18:03.077 --> 18:05.116
It was you! You're a murderer!

18:05.117 --> 18:06.956
It should be you in that grave!

18:06.957 --> 18:08.356
Stand back! Calm down, please.

18:08.357 --> 18:10.356
You're just going to let him get
away with it?

18:10.357 --> 18:12.436
We are investigating
your son's death,

18:12.437 --> 18:13.837
but would ask you to be patient.

18:17.157 --> 18:19.237
It's all right. Don't make a fuss!

18:21.397 --> 18:22.997
Why is everybody staring at me?

18:36.237 --> 18:37.876
I'm sorry, Father,

18:37.877 --> 18:41.396
but I had to come here in case
I did something I'd regret.

18:41.397 --> 18:47.916
You made a very serious public
allegation.

18:47.917 --> 18:49.556
I don't regret one word of it.

18:49.557 --> 18:53.317
What makes you so sure that
Dr Crawford killed your son?

18:54.357 --> 18:57.356
You remember how my Eileen died?

18:57.357 --> 18:58.397
A road accident.

19:00.117 --> 19:01.956
Eileen used to drink

19:01.957 --> 19:04.997
till she could hardly put one
foot in front of another.

19:06.277 --> 19:08.717
One day, she went to see
Dr Crawford...

19:11.397 --> 19:12.757
..drunk out of her mind.

19:15.637 --> 19:18.957
He gave her a prescription for a
headache and sent her on her way.

19:20.837 --> 19:22.637
She walked straight into a lorry.

19:23.797 --> 19:26.396
I'm sure if he could have foretold
the future,

19:26.397 --> 19:28.276
he would have stopped her.

19:28.277 --> 19:31.876
He sent my Eileen to her death
and now he's killed my boy.

19:31.877 --> 19:33.676
I'm sure of it!

19:33.677 --> 19:35.876
Did you send those letters, John?

19:35.877 --> 19:40.237
No, but I'd like to shake
the hand of whoever did.

19:43.957 --> 19:47.317
I can't prove he did it,
but I know he had the motive.

19:49.477 --> 19:50.517
Really?

19:51.877 --> 19:54.637
Oona was having an affair with
Alfred, you know.

19:56.317 --> 19:57.677
He often used to boast about it.

20:02.797 --> 20:06.036
What's wrong with you?
I've never seen you drink before.

20:06.037 --> 20:07.757
Maybe it's time I started. What?

20:09.397 --> 20:11.396
Seeing Alfred, a young man,

20:11.397 --> 20:14.956
suddenly taken, it makes you think.
Maybe it's time we started living.

20:14.957 --> 20:17.156
But you were drunk at a funeral,
Adam!

20:17.157 --> 20:18.836
Yes, and in a few hours,
I'll be sober,

20:18.837 --> 20:21.597
whereas Alfred... Alfred will...
Poor Alfred!

20:24.797 --> 20:26.116
I'm sorry.

20:26.117 --> 20:27.557
It's these letters, isn't it?

20:29.317 --> 20:31.117
I just need to lie down for a while.

20:32.957 --> 20:35.676
Yesterday, you were going to tell me
something.

20:35.677 --> 20:40.317
What? No. No, it's nothing.
Go and lie down.

20:47.557 --> 20:49.076
Oona.

20:49.077 --> 20:51.836
I'm sorry. My husband can't see
anyone at the moment.

20:51.837 --> 20:55.236
Indeed,
he did seem somewhat overwrought.

20:55.237 --> 20:57.637
He does get upset
whenever a patient dies.

20:58.997 --> 21:00.037
Yes, of course.

21:01.597 --> 21:02.996
And you? Were you upset?

21:02.997 --> 21:04.156
What do you mean?

21:04.157 --> 21:07.116
Well, were you close to
Alfred Tatton?

21:07.117 --> 21:08.156
No.

21:08.157 --> 21:10.997
I saw him when he came to
the surgery, but that's it.

21:12.877 --> 21:13.917
Corona Standard.

21:15.117 --> 21:17.117
Er, yes, it's my husband's.

21:18.837 --> 21:23.236
Why don't you type a notice to say
that afternoon surgery is cancelled?

21:23.237 --> 21:25.916
No! He just needed a few
minutes' rest.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.157
I'm sure he's better now.

21:28.717 --> 21:30.317
Then I'll pop in and see him.

21:37.157 --> 21:38.197
Just a minute.

21:45.077 --> 21:46.117
Yes?

21:47.757 --> 21:48.797
Father Brown!

21:51.797 --> 21:53.236
What on earth?

21:53.237 --> 21:55.117
Yes, I'm feeling much
better, thank you.

21:56.557 --> 22:00.956
There's been a lot of talk
about your behaviour today.

22:00.957 --> 22:05.556
My behaviour? All I was trying to do
was pay my condolences.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.836
Yet you told John Tatton
you were sorry.

22:07.837 --> 22:09.557
What exactly are you sorry about?

22:11.837 --> 22:14.517
I'm sorry that I didn't get
to his son sooner...

22:15.597 --> 22:18.236
..that I paused along the way,
I'm sorry that I can't bring

22:18.237 --> 22:20.996
people back from the dead.

22:20.997 --> 22:23.157
Sorry. Things just keep going wrong.

22:25.117 --> 22:27.476
Have any idea who wrote this letter?

22:27.477 --> 22:31.117
Some very troubled individual.
I won't let it bother me.

22:32.637 --> 22:34.037
That's the spirit.

22:36.837 --> 22:38.477
Didn't know you were an astronomer.

22:47.917 --> 22:50.756
It's just...
Just something I dabble in.

22:50.757 --> 22:52.637
Yes, everyone should have a hobby.

22:54.477 --> 22:55.916
Was there anything else?

22:55.917 --> 22:56.957
No.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.637
I'm so sorry,
but they wanted to speak with you.

23:04.157 --> 23:05.196
What's this about?

23:05.197 --> 23:08.557
We can tell you at the station
if you'd like to come this way.

23:11.597 --> 23:13.837
Inspector... And you can stay
right where you are.

23:29.677 --> 23:33.516
I have brought your laundry.
A clean cassock.

23:33.517 --> 23:34.716
Yes.

23:34.717 --> 23:38.197
And I've sorted out the mess you
left the accounts in.

23:39.837 --> 23:40.877
No.

23:42.317 --> 23:45.637
Oh, they asked if you'd like to be
the next Pope. Yes.

23:49.837 --> 23:52.676
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

23:52.677 --> 23:56.596
Oh, nothing important. What's that?

23:56.597 --> 24:00.156
It was written on the typewriter
that lives on Oona's desk.

24:00.157 --> 24:03.677
The same typewriter that wrote
the poison pen letters.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.317
How do you know?

24:07.757 --> 24:09.396
Look at the O.

24:09.397 --> 24:10.596
Yes?

24:10.597 --> 24:12.237
Every single one blocked in.

24:13.837 --> 24:17.476
But that means...
Do you think that...

24:17.477 --> 24:21.676
Right, well, I have tried
every typewriter in town.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.756
Not one of them matches.

24:23.757 --> 24:26.117
I think that deserves a cup of tea.

24:28.237 --> 24:29.557
Or something stronger.

24:32.317 --> 24:35.357
I'm afraid we've discovered
something unpleasant.

24:36.997 --> 24:39.517
The letters were written by Oona.

24:50.597 --> 24:51.637
Oona?

25:00.917 --> 25:01.957
Hello?

25:12.357 --> 25:13.677
Sid's shepherd's crook.

25:21.637 --> 25:22.677
Father Brown?

25:24.197 --> 25:26.356
What have you got there?

25:26.357 --> 25:29.116
Adam's star charts.
Your husband said I could

25:29.117 --> 25:32.596
borrow them.
I thought lying was a sin, Father.

25:32.597 --> 25:33.637
Yes, it is.

25:36.157 --> 25:40.596
And you haven't been
honest about your relationship with

25:40.597 --> 25:41.637
Alfred Tatton.

25:47.117 --> 25:51.556
Of course Alfred used to chase Oona.
It was embarrassing!

25:51.557 --> 25:53.477
He seemed to be obsessed with her.

25:54.757 --> 25:56.477
And how did she feel about him?

25:57.477 --> 25:59.277
He repulsed me.

26:03.437 --> 26:06.517
Did you ever see him
outside of the surgery?

26:10.717 --> 26:11.756
Oona?

26:11.757 --> 26:14.516
All right! I did go to the
barn on the day that he died,

26:14.517 --> 26:17.676
but only to tell him to leave me
alone, once and for all.

26:17.677 --> 26:21.196
Why did you wait
so long to talk about this?

26:21.197 --> 26:24.197
Because I knew it would look
suspicious. And it does.

26:25.677 --> 26:28.317
But what is even more
suspicious is this.

26:31.517 --> 26:33.956
I've no idea who wrote the letter.

26:33.957 --> 26:35.357
A patient with a grudge?

26:36.557 --> 26:39.397
I think this was written by someone
who knows you very well.

26:41.717 --> 26:43.836
Who wrote the letter?

26:43.837 --> 26:45.916
'It wasn't me.'

26:45.917 --> 26:49.036
It was written on your typewriter.

26:49.037 --> 26:52.036
I could never write such a thing.

26:52.037 --> 26:54.757
The police will believe otherwise.

26:56.797 --> 26:58.117
I can't write English.

27:01.477 --> 27:02.517
What?

27:03.917 --> 27:06.077
All my education was in Gaelic.

27:08.157 --> 27:10.317
I can't read or write
English at all.

27:12.477 --> 27:16.716
You see, despite your lies,
someone out there knows the truth.

27:16.717 --> 27:18.636
I'm telling you the truth.
I didn't kill him!

27:18.637 --> 27:20.796
Though you admit
he had designs on your wife.

27:20.797 --> 27:22.996
Yes, he had excellent taste!

27:22.997 --> 27:24.716
And you knew you were
going to lose her.

27:24.717 --> 27:26.436
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

27:26.437 --> 27:31.596
Still, you and Oona had 18
months together. Not a bad innings.

27:31.597 --> 27:33.796
Inspector, just stop this.

27:33.797 --> 27:36.476
Because how could you ever compete
with such a young man?

27:36.477 --> 27:38.356
Just stop it,
whatever you're suggesting!

27:38.357 --> 27:39.876
One so much more virile!

27:39.877 --> 27:42.917
Just shut up!
Just shut up about Alfred Tatton!

27:50.637 --> 27:52.637
All right. It was me.

27:55.317 --> 27:56.357
What?

27:57.477 --> 27:59.236
I did it.

27:59.237 --> 28:00.277
I killed him.

28:05.557 --> 28:08.996
I cannot believe
I was fooled by that woman!

28:08.997 --> 28:11.036
Well, if that's Ursa Major...

28:11.037 --> 28:12.676
This eye patch must have made me
blind!

28:12.677 --> 28:15.836
..then that should be...
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

28:15.837 --> 28:17.596
What if it isn't Dr Crawford's?

28:17.597 --> 28:18.796
What if it's...

28:18.797 --> 28:20.476
The pole star!

28:20.477 --> 28:22.157
Are you listening to me?

28:24.957 --> 28:27.876
Mrs McCarthy, don't move.

28:27.877 --> 28:30.756
What? Stand perfectly still.

28:30.757 --> 28:32.836
Are you all right, Father?

28:32.837 --> 28:36.677
Yes, unlike the poor soul who
will have made these drawings.

28:37.957 --> 28:40.316
Father, I need to... Ah, Sid!

28:40.317 --> 28:41.356
You're here to tell me

28:41.357 --> 28:43.716
that Dr Crawford has been
charged with murder.

28:43.717 --> 28:46.116
Well, yeah, that's right.
And indeed he's confessed.

28:46.117 --> 28:47.996
Well, yeah, he has.
How do you know?

28:47.997 --> 28:49.877
Because it's written in the stars.

28:52.997 --> 28:56.716
Father Brown, I do hope you're
here for religious purposes,

28:56.717 --> 28:58.556
and not to meddle.

28:58.557 --> 29:00.196
I don't know what you mean.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.596
Perhaps you should
think about leaving things to

29:02.597 --> 29:04.196
the professionals from now on.

29:04.197 --> 29:07.636
Never forget, the professionals
built the Titanic.

29:07.637 --> 29:09.237
But an amateur built the Ark.

29:17.917 --> 29:19.356
Hello, Adam.

29:19.357 --> 29:21.077
Hello, Father.

29:22.117 --> 29:23.477
Thank you for coming.

29:26.437 --> 29:28.756
I hear you've confessed.

29:28.757 --> 29:33.396
I knew Alfred had designs on Oona,
so I followed him to the barn

29:33.397 --> 29:34.796
and told him to leave her alone.

29:34.797 --> 29:37.316
And he laughed at me.

29:37.317 --> 29:40.916
Said I was a clapped-out
old has-been, who could never please

29:40.917 --> 29:42.397
her the way he could.

29:44.477 --> 29:48.837
So I climbed the ladder
and I threw him into the metal jaws.

29:53.077 --> 29:55.316
I'd like to say it was
a moment of madness

29:55.317 --> 29:57.517
but I think I went there intending to
do it.

30:00.157 --> 30:01.197
Well, thank you.

30:02.677 --> 30:04.236
What for?

30:04.237 --> 30:06.076
The story.

30:06.077 --> 30:07.916
And when you're released
without charge,

30:07.917 --> 30:11.916
you may think about taking up
a new career writing pulp fiction.

30:11.917 --> 30:13.436
Oh?

30:13.437 --> 30:15.597
You wrote those poison pen letters,
didn't you?

30:17.357 --> 30:20.076
But why would you write something
that could lead to

30:20.077 --> 30:21.437
the hangman's noose?

30:24.517 --> 30:26.957
I think the answer
lies in these charts.

30:28.597 --> 30:30.236
They're not stars, are they?

30:30.237 --> 30:31.916
They're marks.

30:31.917 --> 30:36.877
Maybe moles on a human's body.
Perhaps a patient?

30:38.477 --> 30:41.196
But not just any old patient.

30:41.197 --> 30:43.677
Someone whom you observe
every day.

30:45.517 --> 30:49.917
They are a self-portrait...
of your body.

30:52.357 --> 30:53.676
If anyone could see through me

30:53.677 --> 30:55.836
I might have known it would be you.

30:55.837 --> 30:57.637
Is there something you want
to confess?

30:59.837 --> 31:02.116
Bless me Father for I have sinned.

31:02.117 --> 31:05.396
It has been three weeks
since my last confession.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.317
And they've been busy weeks.

31:08.317 --> 31:09.717
What are those marks?

31:10.997 --> 31:12.317
Tumours on the skin.

31:13.517 --> 31:17.236
The first sign of a virulent
form of cancer.

31:17.237 --> 31:19.157
I've only got a few months left.

31:21.877 --> 31:23.316
So sorry.

31:23.317 --> 31:24.517
Well, it's not your fault.

31:26.437 --> 31:29.516
When I found out, my first thought
was to take my own life.

31:29.517 --> 31:31.317
But suicide is a mortal sin.

31:32.397 --> 31:35.597
And then came that day in the barn.

31:38.757 --> 31:40.956
'I'd gone to give
Alfred his prescription,

31:40.957 --> 31:43.077
'and he was blind drunk, as usual.

31:44.597 --> 31:51.117
'As I entered, he turned to see
who it was and he lost his balance.'

31:57.637 --> 31:59.637
There was nothing
I could do to save him.

32:01.797 --> 32:02.997
I see.

32:04.397 --> 32:06.996
There was a whisky bottle on
the floor

32:06.997 --> 32:11.036
and I knew that John had lost his
wife to alcohol and I thought

32:11.037 --> 32:13.997
it might break his heart
if his son went the same way.

32:15.197 --> 32:17.637
So I picked it up
and took it to my car.

32:19.317 --> 32:21.597
'And then when I came back you were
there.'

32:24.317 --> 32:27.037
Father Brown! Everything all right?

32:29.437 --> 32:32.596
I can see how you would want to
protect his reputation.

32:32.597 --> 32:36.596
But why frame yourself for a murder
that was never committed?

32:36.597 --> 32:40.676
Because I've only got a few
months left to live

32:40.677 --> 32:43.756
and a hangman's noose is a less
painful end.

32:43.757 --> 32:46.556
And I'll be saving Oona
the trouble of nursing me

32:46.557 --> 32:48.917
and the pain of watching me
rot away.

32:51.277 --> 32:54.357
And John. Poor John.

32:55.597 --> 32:58.917
It must be the worst thing in
the world to lose your only child.

32:59.917 --> 33:03.476
But he might gain some comfort
from believing that it was a crime,

33:03.477 --> 33:08.237
not some random act of God and
that the murderer had been punished.

33:10.437 --> 33:12.756
'As I walked towards you that day,

33:12.757 --> 33:15.117
'with that machine in the background,
I thought...

33:16.957 --> 33:18.357
'I can't save Alfred.

33:19.677 --> 33:22.516
'But I can help the people
left behind.

33:22.517 --> 33:28.077
'Before making a quick, painless,
if rather theatrical exit myself.'

33:29.837 --> 33:34.357
So, it was almost therapeutic
writing those letters.

33:36.197 --> 33:38.277
Knowing they would start a rumour.

33:39.277 --> 33:41.637
Which would lead in a few weeks
to a guilty verdict.

33:44.037 --> 33:45.997
This is simply
suicide by another name.

33:47.397 --> 33:52.437
It will bring no peace to John.
It will break Oona's heart.

33:54.637 --> 33:58.076
And it will horrify anyone who
has ever known you.

33:58.077 --> 33:59.557
No, you're wrong.

34:00.637 --> 34:03.517
They'll be happy to see me hanged
because they'll think I'm guilty.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.677
Besides, it's too late.

34:07.997 --> 34:12.036
Public opinion is against me and it's
my first court appearance next week.

34:13.237 --> 34:16.917
When they ask me how I plead and I
say that one word.

34:20.197 --> 34:23.315
It's only a matter of time.
It is not too late.

34:23.317 --> 34:26.476
Oh, but it's been good to have
someone to confide in.

34:26.476 --> 34:29.516
And it's nice to know that thanks to
the seal of the confessional nothing

34:29.516 --> 34:31.917
I've said can go beyond these walls.

34:45.476 --> 34:46.516
'Little runt!

34:48.476 --> 34:51.117
'You're just like your mother!

34:52.877 --> 34:55.036
'Things are going to
change around here, Dad.'

34:55.036 --> 34:56.077
John!

34:58.597 --> 34:59.836
John!

34:59.837 --> 35:01.557
'Things are going to change!'

35:06.597 --> 35:07.757
Father.

35:15.917 --> 35:19.036
Did you know Dr Crawford's
appearing in court?

35:19.037 --> 35:21.797
When? This afternoon. Right.

35:23.197 --> 35:26.796
Well, he'll soon get what
he deserves. And I can look him

35:26.797 --> 35:30.636
in the eye as the noose goes
round his neck.

35:30.637 --> 35:33.077
And I can say, "This is for Alfred."

35:34.477 --> 35:38.117
And when you've done that, will
you feel less guilty?

35:45.757 --> 35:47.237
It was me, Father.

35:49.277 --> 35:50.317
I killed him.

35:51.917 --> 35:54.276
Not with my own hands,
but I drove him to it.

35:54.277 --> 35:55.996
How?

35:55.997 --> 35:57.877
Three years ago, with Eileen.

35:59.237 --> 36:03.236
I didn't do enough for her,
when she was in the gutter.

36:03.237 --> 36:06.197
Someone said she ran in front of
that lorry.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.996
And I knew Alfred drank,
the way she did,

36:10.997 --> 36:13.476
which was why I was so hard on him.

36:13.477 --> 36:15.597
I wanted him to knuckle down.

36:17.677 --> 36:19.637
But what if I drove him to this?

36:21.917 --> 36:23.797
Was he having an affair with Oona?

36:25.317 --> 36:26.837
I don't know.

36:28.117 --> 36:31.837
Perhaps it was just
a teenage boy bragging.

36:34.597 --> 36:36.597
But you needed someone to blame?

36:42.477 --> 36:46.396
I don't really think
Dr Crawford did it, Father.

36:46.397 --> 36:48.196
Why would he?

36:48.197 --> 36:53.077
If you truly believe that...
you should come to the court.

36:55.117 --> 36:56.597
Please.

36:58.277 --> 37:03.557
Please God, whatever happens to me,
will you keep my child safe?

37:06.117 --> 37:08.917
And help me to understand
why my husband did this.

37:15.677 --> 37:17.397
Father?

37:20.957 --> 37:23.476
I've just been talking to Mr Tatton.

37:23.477 --> 37:25.996
He's decided to come to
court with me.

37:25.997 --> 37:27.476
Right.

37:27.477 --> 37:29.037
I wish that you would do the same.

37:30.597 --> 37:32.277
Just to say goodbye.

37:33.397 --> 37:38.037
To a man you promised to love,
to honour...

37:40.437 --> 37:42.677
Father Brown?
I'm sorry.

37:45.197 --> 37:48.156
I got a bit
close to the threshing machine.

37:48.157 --> 37:49.477
It's this chaff...

37:51.037 --> 37:52.356
Chaff?

37:52.357 --> 37:55.677
Yes, I got some in my cassock
last week.

37:56.917 --> 37:58.677
It seems to get everywhere.

38:00.317 --> 38:04.597
But I do my husband's laundry and
his suit was completely spotless.

38:05.597 --> 38:07.116
Was it?

38:07.117 --> 38:08.717
Yes, it was!

38:11.117 --> 38:13.756
'A general practitioner is to
appear in court today,

38:13.757 --> 38:16.196
'charged with the murder of one
of his patients.

38:16.197 --> 38:20.196
'Dr Adam Crawford of Kembleford,
Gloucestershire, is said to

38:20.197 --> 38:24.277
'have deliberately pushed 19-year-old
Alfred Tatton to his death.'

38:27.117 --> 38:28.996
Adam, why are you doing this?

38:28.997 --> 38:31.916
We know you didn't kill Alfred.
I know he drank.

38:31.917 --> 38:35.196
Are you trying to punish me?
Because I've done nothing wrong.

38:35.197 --> 38:36.796
Just go, Oona.

38:36.797 --> 38:38.476
I can't.

38:38.477 --> 38:41.636
Everyone thinks I was with Alfred
and that's why you killed him.

38:41.637 --> 38:43.716
People spit at me in the street.

38:43.717 --> 38:44.996
I did a terrible thing.

38:44.997 --> 38:46.636
And now I have to pay for it.

38:46.637 --> 38:50.836
No, you don't. You're lying
and you're destroying my life.

38:50.837 --> 38:54.396
Why? You have to forget me.
You have to leave Kembleford.

38:54.397 --> 38:55.596
You can start again.

38:55.597 --> 38:59.236
With a child who'll never know
their father?

38:59.237 --> 39:00.996
What?

39:00.997 --> 39:02.597
I'm going to have your baby.

39:06.117 --> 39:09.597
Adam. I love you!

39:30.317 --> 39:34.957
Are you Adam Henry Crawford
of Kembleford in Gloucestershire?

39:38.157 --> 39:40.357
I am.
Adam Henry Crawford...

39:41.637 --> 39:45.277
..you are accused of the wilful
murder of Alfred Tatton.

39:47.557 --> 39:48.717
How do you plead?

40:06.637 --> 40:07.677
Not guilty.

40:16.477 --> 40:19.357
I've come to see my husband.
Take her through.

40:23.437 --> 40:27.356
You'll get into serious trouble one
day. Interfering in police business.

40:27.357 --> 40:30.036
I don't believe this was
police business.

40:30.037 --> 40:32.036
This was a terrible accident,

40:32.037 --> 40:35.957
where, for whatever reason, someone
decided to take the blame.

40:36.957 --> 40:39.716
Perhaps on this occasion,
you might be right.

40:39.717 --> 40:41.077
Indeed.

40:42.157 --> 40:44.676
And perhaps some things are too
important to be left to

40:44.677 --> 40:46.197
the professionals.

40:58.237 --> 41:00.437
How could you tell such
a terrible lie?

41:06.517 --> 41:10.836
For a long time now, I've not been
very well, and...

41:10.837 --> 41:13.197
I couldn't bare
the thought of you seeing me suffer.

41:15.277 --> 41:19.157
So I thought this would be
the easy way out.

41:20.237 --> 41:21.837
Is it serious?

41:23.117 --> 41:24.277
You will get better?

41:25.877 --> 41:27.636
I don't know.

41:27.637 --> 41:29.756
But doctors said you could
never have children,

41:29.757 --> 41:31.636
so what do they know?

41:31.637 --> 41:33.037
Is there anything we can do?

41:34.077 --> 41:37.237
I can find out. I'm not giving up.

41:40.597 --> 41:42.637
What are we going to call this baby?

41:45.357 --> 41:50.277
Well... do you want a boy or a girl?

41:52.757 --> 41:56.197
I want a girl.
I want a girl just like you.

41:58.637 --> 42:00.437
I think we should call her Hope.

42:13.597 --> 42:17.916
Mrs McCarthy!
Turned your back on piracy, I see.

42:17.917 --> 42:20.037
Are you... knitting?

42:21.037 --> 42:22.077
No.

42:23.077 --> 42:27.436
Well, yes, obviously,
but for no particular reason.

42:27.437 --> 42:30.117
You knew Oona was expecting,
didn't you?

42:31.517 --> 42:34.796
All right, but I was sworn to
secrecy.

42:34.797 --> 42:38.276
Even though it would have been quite
useful for me to know.

42:38.277 --> 42:40.276
Oh, talk of the devil.

42:40.277 --> 42:42.356
How are you, Oona?

42:42.357 --> 42:44.556
I'm great, thanks, Father Brown.

42:44.557 --> 42:46.356
How's Adam?

42:46.357 --> 42:50.076
He's fine, he's... looking forward to
the future.

42:50.077 --> 42:52.716
Oh, that's very good to hear.

42:52.717 --> 42:55.876
Of course, I never suspected
either of you of anything.

42:55.877 --> 42:58.157
Course not.

42:59.157 --> 43:01.956
And I hope you will accept
this little

43:01.957 --> 43:05.316
garment as a token of our ongoing
friendship.

43:05.317 --> 43:06.436
Thank you.

43:06.437 --> 43:09.796
That's very impressive knitwear,
Mrs McCarthy.

43:09.797 --> 43:13.596
But I think I read that
women of Breganmore have much more

43:13.597 --> 43:15.796
chance of producing twins.

43:15.797 --> 43:17.196
Old wives' tales.

43:17.197 --> 43:20.756
No, it's true.
Sure, I'm one of triplets myself.

43:20.757 --> 43:22.356
Oh...

43:22.357 --> 43:23.796
Indeed.

43:23.797 --> 43:25.796
I'll have to get some more wool,
then!

43:25.797 --> 43:27.676
Yes, I think you will.

43:27.677 --> 43:29.197
Happy knitting.
