00:03.645 --> 00:06.698
????????????????

00:06.698 --> 00:08.593
?????

00:09.270 --> 00:10.687
??????????

00:10.687 --> 00:14.771
???????into her eyes...

00:14.771 --> 00:16.604
everything else just fell away.

00:16.637 --> 00:18.960
That was it.
Bang, I was gone.

00:18.960 --> 00:19.246
Wow.

00:19.247 --> 00:20.825
Where were you?

00:20.826 --> 00:24.203
Fat Bobby's Sports Bar
and Grill.

00:24.203 --> 00:25.804
That's where all
the magic started.

00:29.303 --> 00:32.302
You guys met at a place
called Fat Bobby's?

00:32.337 --> 00:34.570
Mmm, well, we were in college.

00:34.603 --> 00:36.537
ARIEL:
Still...

00:36.570 --> 00:37.969
Hey, you want to hear
something funn

00:38.003 --> 00:40.136
Daddy and I almost met
three years earlier.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.999
Really?
JOE:
Ye, that's right.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.800
I was a junior in college

00:43.833 --> 00:46.100
and I had a project on display

00:46.134 --> 00:49.334
at the Mesa University
Science and Engineering Fair.

00:50.367 --> 00:51.933
Won third place.

00:51.967 --> 00:54.200
Yeah, we didn't put it
together till years later,

00:54.234 --> 00:56.234
but I was also at
that science fair.

00:56.267 --> 00:57.800
And you guys didn't
see each other?

00:57.833 --> 01:00.200
I guess not.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.599
I like to think
I would've remembered.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.065
Well, that's a
much better story

01:04.066 --> 01:05.867
than meeting at a place
called Fat Bobby's.

01:05.901 --> 01:07.867
Too bad it didn't
happen that way.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.449
Yeah, then I could be older now.

01:10.449 --> 01:11.815
I could be 11.

01:17.516 --> 01:20.048
Hey, Ariel, where's your sister?

01:20.082 --> 01:22.449
What are you talking about?
She's right here?

01:24.482 --> 01:27.382
Joe, did you see her
go to her bedroom?
Who?

01:27.415 --> 01:29.549
Our daughter, Joe.

01:29.582 --> 01:31.349
She's right over there.

01:38.482 --> 01:40.915
Ariel, what's going on?
Where are your sisters?

01:40.948 --> 01:43.115
What are you talking about, Mom?

01:43.149 --> 01:44.681
What sisters?

01:44.715 --> 01:46.648
Okay, this isn't funny.

01:46.681 --> 01:48.982
Will you talk to your
children about...

01:50.549 --> 01:52.715
* 

01:54.516 --> 01:56.282
Oh, my God.

01:56.315 --> 01:58.282
What's happening?

01:59.315 --> 02:01.549
What's happening?

02:01.582 --> 02:03.549
WOMAN:
 <i>Hey, lazy bones.</i>

02:03.582 --> 02:06.149
Wake up! Are you planning
on getting up

02:06.182 --> 02:08.149
and dressed at any point today?

02:08.181 --> 02:11.915
Mom?

02:11.948 --> 02:14.748
I just had the strangest dream.

02:14.781 --> 02:24.781

03:01.813 --> 03:03.784
Allison.He's out catting around.

03:04.813 --> 03:05.749
He'll be back.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.049
You have exactly two minutes

03:07.082 --> 03:08.650
to find something to eat
for breakfast.

03:08.683 --> 03:09.815
I'm not hungry.

03:09.849 --> 03:11.514
What if he gets
hit by a car?

03:11.515 --> 03:13.916
What if he gets lost?

03:13.949 --> 03:15.916
I'll buy you a puppy.

03:15.949 --> 03:17.849
You ready?
Mm-hmm.

03:17.882 --> 03:20.582
When I get married,
I'm staying married.

03:20.615 --> 03:21.749
I'm never getting a divorce.

03:21.782 --> 03:24.149
Ally, cut your
mom some slack.

03:24.183 --> 03:26.183
It's not like the
divorce was her idea.

03:26.216 --> 03:29.183
I know. When I get married,
it's going to be forever.

03:29.216 --> 03:31.049
Married?

03:31.083 --> 03:34.116
How 'bout we get someone to ask
us to the junior prom first?

03:36.316 --> 03:38.482
Which reminds me.
The Mesa University

03:38.515 --> 03:40.482
Science and Engineering Fair
is this weekend.

03:40.515 --> 03:42.716
You want to go?
That's so weird.

03:42.749 --> 03:44.283
Why, because it's
a science fair?

03:44.316 --> 03:46.549
Girls are allowed to want
to go to science fairs.

03:46.582 --> 03:48.450
And I'll let you in
on a little secret.

03:48.482 --> 03:50.716
You know what they have
a lot of at science fairs?

03:50.749 --> 03:52.216
Boys.

03:52.249 --> 03:55.549
No. I mean that
you're asking me.

03:55.582 --> 03:57.450
I had a dream about this.

03:57.482 --> 03:59.016
About the science fair?

03:59.049 --> 04:00.816
About us going, but...

04:00.849 --> 04:03.049
it wasn't really about that.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.816
I was married and I was
telling my kids about it.

04:05.849 --> 04:08.397
Kids?
Three. All girls.

04:08.397 --> 04:09.696
And I was telling them

04:09.729 --> 04:11.196
about how I almost
met their dad

04:11.230 --> 04:12.095
at this science fair.

04:12.096 --> 04:14.699
There's a dad? A husband?

04:14.700 --> 04:17.233
Ally, you are such a tramp.

04:17.267 --> 04:19.267
No.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.500
He was really kind
of cute for an old guy.

04:21.535 --> 04:23.567
He had really great hair.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.934
Well, that's nice.

04:24.967 --> 04:26.834
Look, I hate to
burst your bubble,

04:26.867 --> 04:29.068
but scientifically speaking...

04:29.101 --> 04:32.001
Dreams are just random firing
of neurons in your brain.

04:32.034 --> 04:33.334
They don't mean anything.

04:33.368 --> 04:35.301
They certainly can't
predict the future.

04:35.334 --> 04:36.934
What are you trying to say?

04:36.967 --> 04:39.068
I'm trying to say, I don't
think you're actually

04:39.101 --> 04:40.700
going to meet
Mr. Fabulous Hair

04:40.734 --> 04:42.468
at the science fair
this weekend.

04:43.868 --> 04:46.277
Still want to go? Say yes.

04:46.277 --> 04:47.543
Yes.

04:47.577 --> 04:48.744
Later, 'gator.

04:48.776 --> 04:50.843
While, 'dile.

04:55.710 --> 04:57.010
JOE:
 <i>Milk.</i>

04:57.043 --> 04:58.510
Pink or brown?

04:58.543 --> 05:00.277
Both. Okay.

05:00.310 --> 05:01.644
Fruit wraps...
(carts crashing)

05:01.677 --> 05:03.776
I'm so sorry. I...

05:03.809 --> 05:06.210
That's okay. No harm, no...

05:06.243 --> 05:08.310
Ally?

05:08.343 --> 05:10.477
Allison Rolen?

05:10.510 --> 05:12.243
Is that you?
I can't believe it!

05:12.277 --> 05:13.943
Hey.
Stephen!

05:14.976 --> 05:16.577
Hey! When did you
get into town?

05:16.610 --> 05:18.043
I heard you were
living in New York.

05:18.076 --> 05:20.110
I was. I... New York,

05:20.143 --> 05:22.343
Fort Lauderdale,
Lititz, Pennsylvania.

05:22.377 --> 05:24.410
You move around a lot
in my line of work.

05:24.443 --> 05:27.010
You know, I don't even know
what it is you do.

05:27.043 --> 05:29.610
Have I even seen you
since high school?

05:29.644 --> 05:31.377
Are you married?
Do you have kids?

05:31.410 --> 05:34.043
No wife. No kids. No dogs.
(chuckles)

05:34.076 --> 05:36.343
Did I mention I move around
a lot in my line of work?

05:36.377 --> 05:39.543
Marketing. Telecommunications.
Cellular phones.

05:39.577 --> 05:42.143
You must do very well.
Everyone I know has one.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.909
Hi. How're you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

05:44.943 --> 05:47.043
Stephen Campbell,
this is Joe Dubois,
Hi.

05:47.076 --> 05:48.677
my husband. Engineer.

05:48.710 --> 05:51.010
Hello.
Wife. Three kids.

05:51.043 --> 05:52.976
High school.
Next-door neighbor.

05:53.010 --> 05:54.909
Comic book freak.
You still?

05:54.943 --> 05:56.110
Still.

05:57.644 --> 05:59.243
Oh, hey, let me
give you my number.

05:59.277 --> 06:00.943
Let's get together and
have lunch or something.

06:00.976 --> 06:02.477
That sounds great.

06:02.510 --> 06:04.343
And, uh... how's Izzy?

06:04.377 --> 06:05.677
You're still close?

06:05.710 --> 06:07.477
No, we sort of
lost touch.

06:07.510 --> 06:09.677
She went to Harvard
and I went to Mesa.

06:11.176 --> 06:13.143
So I'll call you?

06:13.176 --> 06:14.943
Yeah, you better.

06:14.976 --> 06:16.809
Good to meet you.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.876
Yes. So long.

06:22.076 --> 06:23.377
Hmm, so what are we talking?

06:23.410 --> 06:26.143
Friend? Boyfriend?
Unrequited love?

06:26.176 --> 06:27.943
Hmm...
All of the above?

06:27.976 --> 06:29.210
Crush. I think.

06:29.243 --> 06:31.377
Him on me. Junior year
of high school.

06:31.410 --> 06:34.043
Aah.
He was pretty shy back then.

06:34.076 --> 06:36.976
Oh, that was not a shy hug
that he gave you.

06:37.010 --> 06:39.210
Well, I guess he's not
as shy as he used to be.

06:44.076 --> 06:45.631
Hello?

06:46.243 --> 06:47.798
An hour.

06:48.510 --> 06:50.065
Yeah, sure.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.210
Okay, bye.

06:55.210 --> 06:56.275
Why do I get the feeling

06:56.276 --> 06:58.910
that I'm gonna be unpacking
all these groceries

06:58.943 --> 07:01.443
by myself? Huh? Huh?

07:04.943 --> 07:07.410
Looks like she was raped
and then strangled to death.

07:07.443 --> 07:09.010
And here's the weird part.

07:09.044 --> 07:10.643
After she was dead,
we think the killer

07:10.677 --> 07:12.710
took the time to redress her
and wash her face

07:12.743 --> 07:15.077
and wrap her up
before he dumped her.

07:15.110 --> 07:17.137
Tow truck driver
working in the area

07:17.138 --> 07:18.405
saw a white sedan

07:18.438 --> 07:20.905
stopped on the shoulder
sometime after midnight.

07:20.938 --> 07:22.438
Afraid that's about
the closest thing

07:22.472 --> 07:24.938
we have to a real clue.

07:24.971 --> 07:27.539
Her name's Nancy Claymore.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.572
Her parents reported her

07:28.605 --> 07:31.105
missing two days ago.

07:31.138 --> 07:34.038
Oh, my God. How old is she?

07:35.071 --> 07:36.871
She just turned 13.

07:43.305 --> 07:45.138
YOUNG ALLISON:
 <i>Have you ever seen</i>
 <i>a dead person?</i>

07:45.172 --> 07:48.172
Oh, my God. You found
a funny cigarette

07:48.205 --> 07:50.572
in your mom's purse
again, didn't you?

07:51.871 --> 07:54.205
I had another dream last night.

07:54.238 --> 07:56.539
Like the last one.
Set in the future?

07:56.572 --> 07:58.804
I explained
this to you.

07:58.838 --> 08:02.238
I just... it felt so real.

08:02.272 --> 08:04.338
I mean, it was so specific.
No, it wasn't.

08:04.372 --> 08:07.071
It just seemed that way.

08:07.105 --> 08:08.905
You were in it.

08:08.938 --> 08:11.905
I mean...
we had lost touch.

08:11.938 --> 08:12.905
We weren't friends anymore.

08:12.938 --> 08:14.838
Well, see, that's
what I mean.

08:14.871 --> 08:16.838
That's never gonna happen.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.205
I was, like, a cop
or something.

08:19.238 --> 08:22.338
Oh, future cop. Cool.

08:22.372 --> 08:24.671
There was this girl.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.771
Nancy Claymore.

08:26.804 --> 08:28.938
She was 13 and she
had been murdered.

08:28.971 --> 08:31.605
Allison.

08:31.639 --> 08:34.272
Come on.
Future cop?

08:34.304 --> 08:35.871
Future dream?

08:35.905 --> 08:38.472
You really think
any of this is gonna happen?

08:38.505 --> 08:40.671
I don't know.

08:40.703 --> 08:42.770
When I dream it...

08:42.804 --> 08:44.871
it all seems so plausible.

08:44.905 --> 08:46.372
You know?

08:46.405 --> 08:48.539
There's nothing about it
that couldn't happen.

08:51.238 --> 08:53.038
Although...

08:53.071 --> 08:55.305
Actually, in the dream...

08:55.338 --> 08:57.639
I did run in this guy.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.038
His name was Stephen,

08:59.071 --> 09:01.405
and I think he was supposed
to be an old friend.

09:02.905 --> 09:04.572
From high school.

09:04.605 --> 09:07.238
I don't know no
stinkin' Stephen.

09:07.272 --> 09:09.038
And <i>I</i> don't know
no stinkin' Stephen.

09:09.071 --> 09:12.138
Ah, praise the Lord.
Hallelujah!

09:12.172 --> 09:14.871
The girl was blind,
now can see!

09:18.405 --> 09:20.372
Looks like you're
getting a new neighbor.

09:24.771 --> 09:26.338
YOUNG ALLISON:
Hi.

09:26.372 --> 09:28.738
What's going on?
Somebody new moving in?

09:28.771 --> 09:31.605
Uh... just me and my dad.

09:33.738 --> 09:35.738
I'm, uh, I'm Stephen.

09:35.995 --> 09:36.995
????????

09:43.412 --> 09:45.379
...and we've got
the mountains.

09:45.612 --> 09:47.679
And the deserts,
obviously.

09:49.245 --> 09:50.712
A lot of seniors,

09:52.046 --> 09:54.912
after they get their license,
will, like, rent a dune buggy

09:54.946 --> 09:58.812
and just spend the day up there
getting trashed.

10:01.479 --> 10:03.912
Well, what, uh...
what about comic book stores?

10:03.946 --> 10:06.278
You guys have,
you guys have comic book stores?

10:07.816 --> 10:08.679
In Chicago,
they're...

10:08.712 --> 10:11.445
they're all over the place.

10:11.479 --> 10:13.046
You read comic books?

10:13.079 --> 10:17.579
Uh... I collect
graphic novels, yes.

10:19.245 --> 10:20.912
What? Come on,
have you ever seen one?

10:20.946 --> 10:22.579
I mean, come on,
you have, you have,

10:22.612 --> 10:24.345
you have <i>Watchmen,</i>
you have <i>Secret Wars,</i>

10:24.379 --> 10:26.779
you have <i>The Dark Knight.</i>

10:26.812 --> 10:29.946
(laughing)
You got to know... you got
to know <i>The Dark Knight.</i>

10:29.979 --> 10:31.445
Come on.

10:31.479 --> 10:33.879
No, the guy, this guy... ah...

10:33.912 --> 10:35.553
the guy who does them,
Frank Miller,

10:35.553 --> 10:37.854
he's just-- he's this,
he's this genius.

10:37.887 --> 10:38.854
IZZY:
Genius?

10:38.887 --> 10:40.653
Like Isaac Newton?

10:40.687 --> 10:42.287
Like Galileo?

10:42.321 --> 10:44.221
I'm talking about
a living genius.

10:44.254 --> 10:45.753
Okay, I'm talking about someone

10:45.787 --> 10:47.187
who makes a difference
in my life,

10:47.221 --> 10:49.653
not some guy who just had
an apple fall on his head

10:49.687 --> 10:51.154
like a million years ago.

10:51.187 --> 10:53.386
Oh, don't mind her.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.321
If you say he's a genius,
I'm sure he's a genius.

10:58.154 --> 11:00.587
(whispers):
Thank you.

11:00.620 --> 11:04.287
But, you know, you don't have
to take my word for it.

11:04.321 --> 11:05.787
Saturday, there's a, uh,

11:05.820 --> 11:07.954
comic book convention
at the Civic Center.

11:07.987 --> 11:10.453
This Saturday,
that's the science fair.

11:13.887 --> 11:17.187
At the college?

11:18.820 --> 11:20.087
I mean, that was the plan.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.221
You know, why don't you just...

11:22.254 --> 11:23.653
why don't you just thi
about that?

11:23.687 --> 11:24.954
Yeah, we will.

11:33.353 --> 11:34.920
What goes in here?

11:34.954 --> 11:37.187
Oh, um...

11:37.221 --> 11:41.287
that is my...
dad's collection.

11:41.321 --> 11:43.020
Collection of what?

11:49.221 --> 11:50.321
No, it's okay.

11:50.353 --> 11:54.120
It's, it's...
it's not loaded.

11:54.154 --> 11:55.453
ALLISON:
 <i>Pablo.</i>

11:55.486 --> 11:57.486
Here, kitty.
(dog barks in distance)

11:58.520 --> 12:00.987
DIANE: Did that cat
run off again?

12:01.020 --> 12:02.987
He'll be back.

12:05.020 --> 12:06.987
Were you at the Campbells again?

12:07.020 --> 12:10.120
Izzy and I were just hanging out
with Stephen.

12:10.154 --> 12:12.987
He's nice.

12:13.020 --> 12:15.154
You're not over there
drinking or anything?

12:15.187 --> 12:17.020
No, Mom, nothing.

12:17.054 --> 12:19.386
I don't even think they
have liquor in their house.

12:19.420 --> 12:22.887
I think Mr. Campbell
is kind of... strict.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.553
Well, what about
Mrs. Campbell?

12:25.587 --> 12:26.787
They moved in a week ago.

12:26.820 --> 12:28.787
I still haven't caught
a glimpse of her.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.353
Oh, there is no
Mrs. Campbell.

12:30.386 --> 12:32.020
I mean, I think
they're divorced.

12:33.054 --> 12:34.854
Really?

12:34.887 --> 12:37.054
So he's raising
that boy all alone.

12:37.087 --> 12:38.587
Mom.

12:38.620 --> 12:40.020
I don't think
it's a good idea

12:40.054 --> 12:42.154
for you to get involved
with Mr. Campbell.

12:42.187 --> 12:45.254
Who said anything
about getting involved?

12:45.287 --> 12:47.620
There's nothing wrong
with baking them

12:47.653 --> 12:48.987
a batch of cookies,
is there?

12:49.020 --> 12:50.553
To say "Welcome
to the neighborhood."

12:51.587 --> 12:53.720
I'm going to sleep.

12:53.753 --> 12:56.254
DEVALOS:
 <i>I appreciate everyone</i>
 <i>coming together this afternoon.</i>

12:56.287 --> 12:59.820
I know that since we've formed
this Nancy Claymore Task Force,

12:59.854 --> 13:03.620
we've all been taking a lot
of criticism in the press,

13:03.653 --> 13:05.887
and while there
haven't been any major
breakthroughs in the case,

13:05.920 --> 13:08.120
there is some new information
we wanted to share.

13:08.154 --> 13:09.221
Lee?

13:09.254 --> 13:12.087
Um, the police psychiatrist
is saying

13:12.120 --> 13:15.187
this is probably the first time
the perpetrator killed.

13:15.221 --> 13:18.120
According to him, the
murder scene and the methodology

13:18.154 --> 13:21.287
are riddled with wt they call
"indicators of remorse."

13:21.321 --> 13:23.154
Taking the time
to re-dress the victim,

13:23.187 --> 13:24.787
wash her, wrap her
in a blanket.

13:24.820 --> 13:26.420
They feel all of these
things are indications

13:26.453 --> 13:28.453
that the killer felt
badly about what he did.

13:28.486 --> 13:30.687
Not badly enough, unfortunately,

13:30.720 --> 13:32.620
to pick up the phone
and turn himself in.

13:32.653 --> 13:34.386
DEVALOS:
The doctors feel

13:34.420 --> 13:36.787
that while he's never killed,
he'll probably have

13:36.820 --> 13:40.486
a long record of inappropriate
conduct with minor girls.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.620
That's why we've supplied each
of you with a complete file

13:43.653 --> 13:45.054
of all the registered
sex offenders

13:45.087 --> 13:46.854
here in the Phoenix metro area.

13:46.887 --> 13:48.453
Study the sheets.

13:48.486 --> 13:49.987
Feel free to conduct
any interviews

13:50.020 --> 13:52.386
if you feel there is cause.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.820
And what a wonderful
coincidence.

13:54.854 --> 13:58.386
Here come the latest sheets.

13:58.387 --> 13:59.587
Add these to
your binders.

13:59.620 --> 14:01.020
These would be for
anyone who's relocated

14:01.053 --> 14:02.754
to our jurisdiction in
the last four weeks,

14:02.787 --> 14:04.921
and as ordered by the courts,

14:04.953 --> 14:07.554
have registered their
whereabouts with the police.

14:10.304 --> 14:13.104
Oh, my God.

14:13.137 --> 14:14.670
You know this man?

14:15.503 --> 14:18.304
I knew him... in high school.

14:18.338 --> 14:21.704
Suddenly last week,
there he was in the supermarket.

14:21.737 --> 14:25.603
Says here he raped a
14-year-old girl
back in Pennsylvania.

14:25.637 --> 14:27.704
You've got
some interesting friends.

14:28.770 --> 14:31.104
STEPHEN:
 <i>Hey, Allison.</i>

14:31.137 --> 14:33.603
Wake up.

14:33.637 --> 14:36.137
Allison.
(dog barking)

14:40.971 --> 14:43.004
I've got a surprise for you.

14:45.004 --> 14:46.438
What are you doing here?

14:46.470 --> 14:48.603
It's the middl
of the night.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.704
Yeah, I couldn't sleep,

14:51.737 --> 14:54.669
and I saw this little guy
sneaking through my backyard,

14:54.670 --> 14:56.804
so I chased him down.

14:56.927 --> 15:00.294
I know how worried you get
when he's out all night.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.567
thanks for bringing him home.

15:14.601 --> 15:16.567
Yeah, no problem.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.567
you should, um...

15:26.601 --> 15:28.534
you should
probably get going.

15:28.567 --> 15:32.100
Yeah, I don't want my dad
to figure out I'm gone.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.201
But I'll, I'll
see you tomorrow?

15:36.234 --> 15:38.001
Yeah.

16:03.442 --> 16:05.075
What's the matter,
Future Cop?

16:05.108 --> 16:07.509
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.875
Don't make fun.

16:09.908 --> 16:11.042
I had another dream.

16:11.075 --> 16:12.375
Oh, boy.

16:12.409 --> 16:15.042
Just give me
your opinion.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.108
What if I saw something,

16:17.142 --> 16:18.776
dreamt something
about a person?

16:18.808 --> 16:21.509
Something horrible, something
that they were going to do

16:21.542 --> 16:23.509
in the future.

16:23.542 --> 16:26.709
Even if I couldn't prove it,
shouldn't I tell somebody?

16:26.742 --> 16:29.075
Shouldn't I try
and stop it?

16:29.108 --> 16:32.975
Um, in my opinion, no.

16:33.008 --> 16:34.108
No?

16:34.142 --> 16:38.008
No, people will
think you're nuts.

16:38.042 --> 16:40.875
I'm your best friend,
and I think you're nuts.

16:40.908 --> 16:44.509
But I'm talking
about something--

16:44.542 --> 16:46.309
it's so awful,
it's so evil...

16:46.342 --> 16:47.442
Hey.

16:47.475 --> 16:49.709
You want to know what
I really believe?

16:49.742 --> 16:51.642
You don't like the
way the future looks?

16:51.676 --> 16:53.108
Change it.

16:53.142 --> 16:57.208
It hasn't happened yet;
it's subject to alteration.

16:57.242 --> 17:00.642
You believe someone's going
to do something awful.

17:00.676 --> 17:04.075
Then don't let them.

17:04.108 --> 17:05.776
For that matter,

17:05.808 --> 17:09.974
if you believe we're going
to stop being friends,

17:10.008 --> 17:11.041
don't allow it.

17:12.509 --> 17:17.208
The next time someone wants
to do something with you,

17:17.242 --> 17:19.075
and you already
have plans with me,

17:19.108 --> 17:21.608
don't tell them that
you'll think about it.

17:22.941 --> 17:24.142
That's my future.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.675
I've got to go.
Well, Izzy...

17:25.709 --> 17:27.108
I got class.

17:35.941 --> 17:40.142
Hey. So, uh, 
what have you decided?

17:43.509 --> 17:45.975
About Saturday,
the, uh, comic show?

17:46.008 --> 17:48.609
Yeah, I know.
I, I just... I can't.

17:48.642 --> 17:50.841
Wh-why?

17:50.875 --> 17:52.742
Because I can't.

17:52.776 --> 17:55.175
I mean, I don't
want to.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.941
I'm going to the Science
Fair with Izzy.

17:56.975 --> 17:58.108
I told her I would,

17:58.142 --> 18:00.908
and she's my best friend
and she's counting on it.

18:03.175 --> 18:05.475
All right.

18:05.509 --> 18:07.042
Okay, well, then maybe
we can, uh,

18:07.075 --> 18:09.308
maybe we can do something
Sunday.

18:09.309 --> 18:10.942
I don't think so.

18:10.975 --> 18:12.741
I mean, I'm
kinda feeling that

18:12.775 --> 18:15.509
maybe it would just
be better if...

18:15.542 --> 18:17.008
I don't know.

18:17.042 --> 18:19.442
Well, why?

18:19.476 --> 18:20.708
What, what...

18:20.741 --> 18:22.808
have I done something wrong?

18:22.842 --> 18:25.641
No, it's just... it's me.

18:25.675 --> 18:27.008
I'm going through something.

18:27.042 --> 18:28.746
Trying to figure something out.

18:28.747 --> 18:30.613
Maybe, maybe I can help.

18:30.647 --> 18:33.047
I don't think so.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.513
Not right now.

18:35.546 --> 18:39.647
You sure I haven't, I haven't
done anything...

18:39.680 --> 18:41.446
to make you, make you mad at me?

18:41.480 --> 18:43.880
No, you didn't do anything.

18:43.913 --> 18:45.613
I'm not mad at you.

18:45.647 --> 18:48.480
Yeah.

18:48.513 --> 18:50.999
Right, I mean, how,
how could you be?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.801
All I did was bring back
your cat, right?

18:53.833 --> 18:57.833
I really do appreciate that.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.167
Yeah, sure you do.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.167
Really, I'm sorry. It's...

19:03.200 --> 19:04.300
really, it's me.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.567
Yeah, sure it is.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.734
SCANLON:
 <i>It's right this way,</i>
 <i>Mr. Campbell.</i>

19:11.767 --> 19:13.233
This should only take
a few moments.

19:13.234 --> 19:14.467
Whatever you say.

19:14.501 --> 19:17.700
I'm just, I'm completely baffled
as to why...

19:17.733 --> 19:20.300
Stephen, it's nice
to see you again.

19:20.334 --> 19:21.700
Allison.

19:21.733 --> 19:22.733
I didn't get

19:22.766 --> 19:23.766
a chance to tell you

19:23.800 --> 19:25.067
I work for the District
Attorney's office.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.067
I asked the detective

19:26.100 --> 19:28.367
to contact you.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.766
I was hoping you
could help us with

19:29.800 --> 19:31.967
the Nancy Claymore case.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.434
I'm sorry. Who?

19:34.467 --> 19:35.800
SCANLON:
A 13-year-old girl.

19:35.833 --> 19:38.601
She was kidnapped
and murdered last week.

19:38.633 --> 19:39.766
We're conducting
preliminary interviews

19:39.800 --> 19:41.733
with several persons
of interest

19:41.766 --> 19:45.234
based on their histories
of sexual assault on minors.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.933
Stephen, please, have a seat.

19:57.601 --> 19:59.933
SCANLON:
Two years ago you
pleaded no contest

19:59.967 --> 20:02.501
to a charge of sexual battery
on a 14-year-old girl.

20:02.534 --> 20:07.267
Yes. I made an error
in judgment.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.833
You want to tell us about that?

20:08.867 --> 20:12.000
She told me she was 20,
and I believed her.

20:12.033 --> 20:14.100
According to her deposition,
she asked you several

20:14.134 --> 20:15.300
times to stop.

20:15.334 --> 20:17.467
It looks like
the charges were
reduced from rape

20:17.501 --> 20:19.467
to battery to avoid a trial.

20:19.501 --> 20:21.967
Because they couldn't prove
their case,

20:22.000 --> 20:23.666
because there was no case.

20:23.700 --> 20:27.000
It was all lies.

20:27.033 --> 20:30.501
When her parents found out
about us, they got angry at her,

20:30.534 --> 20:32.933
so she lied to them
about what happened.

20:32.967 --> 20:35.567
She lied to them
the way she lied to me,

20:35.601 --> 20:38.499
and now because of her lies,

20:38.500 --> 20:42.134
I'm considered a predator
in the eyes of the law.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.100
So what do you want to know,

20:47.134 --> 20:49.267
Detective?

20:49.301 --> 20:51.034
Allison,

20:51.067 --> 20:53.100
how can I convince you
of my innocence?

20:55.234 --> 20:56.366
SCANLON:
You can tell me

20:56.400 --> 20:58.067
where you were on the
afternoon of the 15th.

20:59.715 --> 21:01.467
I... I was at home.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.267
Can anyone else
confirm that?

21:04.300 --> 21:06.667
No, I don't think so.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.100
What color car do you drive?

21:09.133 --> 21:10.801
White.

21:12.734 --> 21:14.099
Would you be willing
to provide us

21:14.100 --> 21:15.399
with a sample of your DNA,

21:15.400 --> 21:18.067
or are you gonna make me, uh,
fetch it from Pennsylvania?

21:18.100 --> 21:22.067
Uh, I have nothing to hide.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.767
Okay.

21:30.967 --> 21:32.700
You'll understand, right,

21:32.733 --> 21:35.767
when I don't call you about
getting together for lunch?

22:00.466 --> 22:02.633
Pablo,

22:02.667 --> 22:04.934
is that you?

22:07.767 --> 22:09.934
Here, kitty.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.400
Here, boy.

22:41.229 --> 22:42.996
I know you're upset.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.795
Sometimes

22:44.796 --> 22:46.295
in nature these things happen.

22:46.329 --> 22:48.362
A bigger animal
comes along and...

22:48.362 --> 22:49.629
Mom,

22:49.663 --> 22:53.096
I don't think
an animal killed Pablo.

22:54.696 --> 22:56.663
I think...

22:57.730 --> 22:59.929
I think maybe
the Campbell boy did it.

22:59.962 --> 23:03.830
Oh, I know you're upset.
Allison...

23:03.863 --> 23:05.897
He was mad at me.

23:05.929 --> 23:07.929
He likes me, and...

23:07.962 --> 23:10.563
and I've kind of
been avoiding him.

23:10.596 --> 23:13.196
So you think he killed your cat?

23:13.946 --> 23:14.879
Allison.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.880
And that's not the only thing.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.747
I've been having dreams again.

23:21.780 --> 23:24.280
You know this is crazy talk,

23:24.313 --> 23:26.446
and you know it upsets me,

23:26.480 --> 23:28.613
and it has nothing to do

23:28.647 --> 23:31.812
with the cat being torn apart
by a dog or a coyote...

23:31.813 --> 23:33.813
Mom, I'm trying to tell you.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.447
I've had dreams about him

23:35.480 --> 23:37.046
in the future,

23:37.080 --> 23:40.013
doing horrible things to girls.

23:40.046 --> 23:42.513
Girls younger than me.

23:42.547 --> 23:46.013
Well, I-I... I got
to tell you something.

23:46.046 --> 23:48.779
That says a lot more about you
than it does him.

23:50.347 --> 23:52.347
Why would you dream

23:52.380 --> 23:56.247
about anyone doing anything
to young girls?

23:58.146 --> 24:00.347
Well, you know who
I blame for this?

24:00.380 --> 24:02.380
Mom, we're not talking
about Grandma now.

24:02.413 --> 24:06.325
For filling your head full
of this nonsense about dreams,

24:06.325 --> 24:07.658
about the future.

24:07.659 --> 24:09.993
It was bad enough
I had to endure it

24:10.026 --> 24:12.225
growing up when I
was under her roof.

24:12.259 --> 24:14.159
But now?
Mom...

24:14.192 --> 24:16.993
You grandmother does not know
the future.

24:17.026 --> 24:19.326
She does not have visions
or dreams.

24:19.359 --> 24:21.092
She's crazy.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.726
Mom, what are you doing?

24:22.759 --> 24:24.225
I need you to listen.

24:24.259 --> 24:25.826
You're upset.
Please.

24:25.859 --> 24:27.159
I just want you to take one

24:27.192 --> 24:28.526
of these pills
and get some sleep.

24:28.559 --> 24:30.092
Mom, I need you
to listen to me!

24:30.125 --> 24:32.693
No. I won't listen.

24:32.726 --> 24:35.001
Not when you're
talking crazy.

24:35.002 --> 24:38.036
I don't want to listen
to anything about dreams,

24:38.069 --> 24:41.703
about special feelings, about

24:41.736 --> 24:44.569
predictions.

24:44.603 --> 24:47.102
Are you gonna take one
of these or not?

24:52.736 --> 24:54.736
IZZY:
Hey.

25:04.869 --> 25:07.670
I'm so sorry about Pablo.

25:08.969 --> 25:10.969
Your mom told me.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.935
It's really awful.

25:17.503 --> 25:19.869
Anyway, I want you to know,

25:19.902 --> 25:21.202
I totally understand

25:21.236 --> 25:23.603
if you don't want
to come with me today.

25:25.036 --> 25:26.670
What are you
talking about?

25:26.703 --> 25:29.236
To the science fair.

25:29.269 --> 25:31.369
Oh.

25:31.403 --> 25:32.770
Right.

25:32.802 --> 25:35.136
I mean, I...
I know you're upset.

25:35.169 --> 25:37.136
I know you're depressed, so...

25:37.169 --> 25:39.202
relax.

25:39.236 --> 25:41.069
We don't have to go.

25:41.102 --> 25:43.069
We can just stay here.

25:46.336 --> 25:49.436
Besides, we don't
want to risk

25:49.469 --> 25:53.136
running into
your future husband accidentally

25:53.169 --> 25:55.269
and messing up everything

25:55.303 --> 25:57.403
that's supposed
to happen in the future,

25:57.436 --> 26:01.536
and completely screwing up
the balance of nature,

26:01.569 --> 26:04.169
and changing the course

26:04.202 --> 26:06.236
of human development

26:06.269 --> 26:08.269
on the planet Earth.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.835
Actually...

26:12.869 --> 26:14.503
I think I
want to go.

26:14.536 --> 26:16.169
 IZZY:
 <i>Okay.</i>

26:16.202 --> 26:17.770
I'm totally confused.

26:17.802 --> 26:19.336
Now we're looking
for Mr. Goodhair?

26:19.369 --> 26:20.835
Yeah.

26:20.869 --> 26:22.403
Don't you see?

26:22.436 --> 26:24.503
He's part of the future
I've been dreaming.

26:24.536 --> 26:26.869
In my dreams, I don't
meet him until college,

26:26.902 --> 26:28.736
unless right
now, right here,

26:28.770 --> 26:30.835
I make it a point
to meet him.

26:30.869 --> 26:32.770
(camera shutter clicking)
I change
the future.

26:34.272 --> 26:36.930
And then maybe,
just... just maybe,

26:36.930 --> 26:39.396
all the bad things
I've been dreaming
about won't happen.

26:39.397 --> 26:40.797
Allison?

26:40.831 --> 26:43.797
You are in dire need
of psychological help,

26:43.831 --> 26:46.497
or, I don't know, a...

26:46.530 --> 26:49.597
conk on the noggin
with a big hammer or something.

26:49.630 --> 26:52.464
You're not gonna meet
this Joe guy today.

26:52.497 --> 26:54.964
He's not in here.

26:54.997 --> 26:57.697
He's in there.

26:57.731 --> 26:59.164
He doesn't exist.

26:59.198 --> 27:01.330
Well, we'll just
see, won't we?

27:01.363 --> 27:02.864
(laughing):
Oh!

27:07.697 --> 27:09.664
Come here for a second.

27:10.931 --> 27:12.697
How would you
pronounce that name?

27:14.831 --> 27:17.230
Joseph Duboys?

27:17.264 --> 27:19.430
Yoseph Dew-bwa?

27:19.464 --> 27:21.297
I think
this is it.

27:21.330 --> 27:23.297
I think this is his.

27:23.330 --> 27:24.931
Looks like the future's safe.

27:24.964 --> 27:26.297
Did you see that?

27:30.797 --> 27:32.764
What are you guys
looking at?

27:32.797 --> 27:34.197
Hey.

27:34.230 --> 27:36.664
You know, I've been looking
for you two everywhere.

27:36.697 --> 27:39.297
What are you doing here?

27:39.330 --> 27:41.297
I don't know.

27:41.330 --> 27:44.297
Um, it was kind of a...
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.664
You know, I knew
this was where

27:46.697 --> 27:48.596
you really wanted to be,
so I thought,

27:48.597 --> 27:50.462
if Allison wants to go
to the science fair,

27:50.463 --> 27:54.085
then, you know, the hell
with the comic book convention.

27:57.366 --> 27:59.232
That's so sweet.

28:00.532 --> 28:03.005
So, you guys want
to grab some lunch after?

28:03.006 --> 28:04.972
I'm, uh...

28:05.006 --> 28:06.273
I'm buying.

28:06.306 --> 28:09.606
No. I just... I really
want to go home after.

28:09.640 --> 28:10.849
Oh.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.850
I guess, um,

28:12.882 --> 28:14.516
you didn't hear.

28:14.549 --> 28:16.683
Pablo was killed last night.

28:16.716 --> 28:18.716
In her yard.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.549
Like, a dog

28:20.583 --> 28:22.383
or something.

28:24.649 --> 28:26.649
Oh, that's terrible.

28:27.783 --> 28:28.949
That's terrible.

28:28.982 --> 28:31.349
Allison, I am so sorry.

28:33.116 --> 28:34.583
This is really awful. Allison...

28:34.616 --> 28:36.383
IZZY:
Allison,

28:36.416 --> 28:37.449
what are you doing?

28:37.450 --> 28:38.450
It's okay.
She's just...

28:38.483 --> 28:40.649
She's-She's upset.

28:41.652 --> 28:44.085
You stay away from me.

28:44.086 --> 28:45.752
I know all about you.

28:45.786 --> 28:47.420
I know who you are.

28:47.453 --> 28:48.251
IZZY:
Allison,

28:48.252 --> 28:50.319
what's wrong with you?
Nothing.
She's upset.

28:50.352 --> 28:53.020
That's all. She just doesn't
know what she's talking about.

28:53.053 --> 28:54.085
I have to go.

28:54.086 --> 28:55.086
I have to go home.

28:55.119 --> 28:59.678
I need to be by
myself for a while.

28:59.679 --> 29:02.012
SCANLON:
 <i>Do you know why you're here?</i>

29:02.013 --> 29:03.045
Because

29:03.046 --> 29:05.071
there's been a screw-up
somewhere.

29:05.071 --> 29:06.804
Because somebody,
someplace has made a mistake.

29:06.837 --> 29:08.304
SCANLON:
Well, should
that turn out

29:08.337 --> 29:09.636
to be the case,
then you're absolutely

29:09.637 --> 29:11.303
within your rights
to file a complaint

29:11.337 --> 29:12.504
th the proper authorities.

29:12.537 --> 29:14.236
But I suspect
you'll be a little busy

29:14.237 --> 29:16.437
finding yourself
a good defense attorney.

29:18.652 --> 29:19.651
What's this?

29:19.652 --> 29:20.718
Who are these people?

29:20.719 --> 29:22.051
ALLISON:
These are
the faces

29:22.052 --> 29:23.353
of the seven
young girls

29:23.386 --> 29:25.885
that you raped but
chose not to kill.

29:25.919 --> 29:27.519
The seven that
we know about.

29:27.553 --> 29:29.152
The seven that
we can prove.

29:31.634 --> 29:33.000
You believe this?

29:33.001 --> 29:34.999
You believe
that I raped all these girls?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I believe in
science, Stephen,

29:37.033 --> 29:38.968
and the science
says you did it.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.100
SCANLON:
Not only were we able
to make a DNA tch,

29:42.133 --> 29:43.766
but no matter what part
of the country

29:43.767 --> 29:45.267
these abductions
and rapes occurred in,

29:45.301 --> 29:48.260
it coincided with your arrival
and departure from that region.

29:48.261 --> 29:49.460
ALLISON:
It's just a
matter of time.

29:49.461 --> 29:50.627
We're faxing
your photograph

29:50.660 --> 29:53.470
to the local police
in each jurisdiction.

29:54.128 --> 29:56.827
These girls will
identify you.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.912
They will testify.

29:58.913 --> 30:00.879
But that's the least
of your problems,

30:00.913 --> 30:01.877
because we're charging you

30:01.878 --> 30:03.912
with the murder
of Nancy Claymore.

30:06.646 --> 30:08.613
I see.

30:08.646 --> 30:10.679
And...

30:10.713 --> 30:12.745
what is it you want from me?

30:12.778 --> 30:14.878
A confession
would be nice.

30:14.912 --> 30:17.512
It would save
us the effort

30:17.546 --> 30:20.679
and the expense
involved in a trial.

30:20.713 --> 30:23.412
I am authorized
to offer you

30:23.446 --> 30:27.512
life without the
possibility of parole.

30:27.546 --> 30:30.312
My goodness.

30:30.346 --> 30:33.379
Your mom must be awfully
proud of you.

30:33.412 --> 30:36.279
I'm trying to help you
avoid the death penalty.

30:36.312 --> 30:38.379
Again?

30:40.579 --> 30:43.812
Do you remember...

30:43.845 --> 30:47.812
the day your Mom had you bring
some cookies over to my house?

30:49.713 --> 30:51.845
Of course you don't.

30:51.878 --> 30:54.912
It wasn't a particularly
important day for you.

30:54.945 --> 30:57.479
All you did was walk over

30:57.512 --> 31:00.246
to the new neighbors' house
and knock on the front door.

31:01.550 --> 31:02.523
Okay...

31:02.987 --> 31:05.321
But, see,
what you didn't know

31:05.354 --> 31:09.087
was that right before you
knocked on that door...

31:09.088 --> 31:11.287
I had a gun in my mouth.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.654
And I was determined
to kill myself.

31:13.687 --> 31:17.053
I remember it so clearly.

31:17.054 --> 31:18.387
Across the street..

31:18.421 --> 31:22.187
the McElroys were getting ready
for their family reunion.

31:22.221 --> 31:26.321
And down the block,
some guy was washing his car

31:26.354 --> 31:30.187
and he had his car radio
blasting "Sister Christian."

31:30.221 --> 31:33.387
My dad had just kicked
the crap out of me for

31:33.421 --> 31:36.721
leaving a jar of jelly
out on the counter overnight.

31:36.754 --> 31:39.387
So I sat down
on the couch.

31:39.421 --> 31:44.287
I put one of his precious
antique revolvers in my mouth,

31:44.321 --> 31:46.120
and then...

31:46.154 --> 31:48.521
there was a knock on the door.

31:50.888 --> 31:55.154
And who did I find standing
on my doorstep...

31:55.187 --> 31:58.888
but the girl next door...

31:58.921 --> 32:01.421
Allison Rolen.

32:01.454 --> 32:02.987
My secret crush.

32:03.020 --> 32:07.454
And wonder of wonders
we talked,

32:07.488 --> 32:08.821
and...

32:08.855 --> 32:12.688
started thinking that maybe
she likes me.

32:12.721 --> 32:16.020
And maybe life is worth
living after all.

32:18.521 --> 32:20.821
I need a confession, Stephen.

32:20.855 --> 32:22.554
Are you prepared to do that?

32:22.588 --> 32:25.588
Do I call a stenographer?

32:25.621 --> 32:28.955
Or do I call my boss and tell
him that we are having a trial?

32:34.287 --> 32:35.888
You hear that knock?

32:37.554 --> 32:39.354
Isn't she something?

32:39.387 --> 32:42.321
She's going to save
my life again.

32:59.987 --> 33:03.387
Hey. What's going on?

33:07.087 --> 33:09.287
What did he do to you?

33:09.321 --> 33:12.421
I don't know... he just...

33:12.454 --> 33:15.621
one minute we were
just talking, and then...

33:15.654 --> 33:18.493
he tried to kiss me...

33:18.493 --> 33:20.625
and then he was...

33:20.626 --> 33:22.926
on top of me and...

33:22.960 --> 33:25.793
I said, "No," and then...

33:25.826 --> 33:27.826
he got really angry.

33:27.859 --> 33:31.659
Izzy, did he hurt you?
No.

33:31.693 --> 33:35.459
No. We heard
his dad come home.

33:35.492 --> 33:38.893
And then he let go of me,

33:38.926 --> 33:42.592
and I just ran out the back
door and I came over here.

33:42.626 --> 33:45.559
(dog barking)
I just...

33:46.626 --> 33:50.393
I can't let my mom
see me like this.

33:50.427 --> 33:51.693
Can I come in?

33:51.726 --> 33:54.427
Please? Can I just...?
Of course, you can.

33:54.459 --> 33:56.226
Sure. Come on.

34:03.559 --> 34:04.893
(sobbing):
Allie...

34:04.926 --> 34:07.492
I don't know what
would have happened

34:07.526 --> 34:11.193
if his dad hadn't come hom

34:11.226 --> 34:13.525
I really don't.

34:13.559 --> 34:17.626
Yeah, well... I do.

34:17.659 --> 34:20.226
I know.

34:31.550 --> 34:33.283
Can I throw these
out somewhere?

34:33.284 --> 34:35.818
I don't want to
take a chance on
my mom seeing them.

34:35.851 --> 34:37.117
Yeah, sure.

34:42.417 --> 34:44.985
I really think we
need to tell someone.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.518
Tell them what?

34:47.551 --> 34:51.618
Tell 'em... that he scared me?
That he's a jerk?

34:51.650 --> 34:53.951
Last night, you
said that...
Yeah. Well...

34:53.985 --> 34:57.016
Last night I was upset.

34:57.050 --> 34:58.484
Today I see that I'm fine

34:58.518 --> 35:00.184
and that nothing
really happened.

35:01.322 --> 35:02.956
Not really.

35:02.990 --> 35:05.322
But Izzy...

35:05.356 --> 35:07.955
what if you knew he was
going to do it again?

35:07.956 --> 35:09.490
But worse.

35:09.522 --> 35:11.789
What if you knew other girls
were going to get hurt?

35:11.822 --> 35:13.655
Is this dream talk again?

35:13.689 --> 35:15.822
Listen to me.

35:15.823 --> 35:17.489
I don't know anything about
the future, Allison,

35:17.522 --> 35:19.689
and neither do you.

35:19.722 --> 35:22.856
This is about me.

35:22.889 --> 35:28.856
This is about something that
really happened to me.

35:28.889 --> 35:32.923
And that means I get to decide
what to do about it.

35:33.362 --> 35:34.895
I'm sorry.

35:34.928 --> 35:36.229
Promise me.

35:36.262 --> 35:39.329
Promise me you won't tell anyone
about this.

35:42.962 --> 35:44.662
Allison, promise me.

35:46.126 --> 35:47.658
And promise me

35:47.659 --> 35:49.626
we'll never talk
about this again.

35:49.659 --> 35:50.925
Izzy...

35:50.958 --> 35:53.891
Promise me!

35:56.558 --> 35:58.259
I promise.

36:02.358 --> 36:03.915
Okay.

36:04.759 --> 36:08.191
Well, I guess I better go.

36:10.959 --> 36:12.592
Izzy?

36:16.392 --> 36:19.325
This is it, isn't it?

36:19.358 --> 36:23.126
We're not gonna be friends
after this, are we?

36:23.191 --> 36:27.592
Why are you saying that?

36:27.625 --> 36:29.925
Isn't there enough bad already?

36:29.959 --> 36:31.158
Why do you say that?

36:31.191 --> 36:35.059
I don't know.

36:35.092 --> 36:38.059
It's just a feeling I have.

36:50.925 --> 36:52.625
Oh, good, you're here.

36:52.659 --> 36:56.191
Uh, Stacey called in sick--
lazy, hung-over tramp--

36:56.225 --> 36:57.992
so I have to cover her shift.

36:58.026 --> 37:01.558
And, uh, can you bring
these cookies over

37:01.592 --> 37:02.625
to the Campbells' house

37:02.659 --> 37:05.710
along with that note
inviting Mr. Campbell

37:05.710 --> 37:07.609
over for dinner next week?

37:07.610 --> 37:10.310
Mom, the last place
in the world I want to go

37:10.343 --> 37:11.442
is the Campbell house.

37:11.443 --> 37:13.243
Why, did you and
Stephen have a fight?

37:13.276 --> 37:14.776
No.

37:14.809 --> 37:16.676
What's the problem, then?

37:16.709 --> 37:20.743
I can't talk about it,
but I'm not going over there.

37:20.776 --> 37:22.809
I'm asking you, please.

37:22.843 --> 37:24.410
No.

37:24.443 --> 37:27.143
I don't ask
for much from you.

37:27.176 --> 37:32.010
Tips are lousy, your dad's
child-support payment is late,

37:32.043 --> 37:34.176
and the car needs new
brake pads

37:34.210 --> 37:35.743
I can't pay for.

37:35.776 --> 37:37.642
So do this one
thing for me,

37:37.676 --> 37:40.976
okay, without
giving me any attitude.

37:45.809 --> 37:47.943
Okay.

38:55.909 --> 38:58.709
I talked to the police.

38:58.743 --> 39:01.943
He shot himself.

39:01.976 --> 39:06.943
I'm so sorry, honey,
but he's dead.

39:09.343 --> 39:11.809
I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.

39:11.810 --> 39:14.277
I know you cared
about him.

39:14.309 --> 39:17.943
I did.

39:17.976 --> 39:19.210
I really did.

39:19.243 --> 39:21.210
I know.

39:22.003 --> 39:23.836
Would you like me to give you
something...

39:23.870 --> 39:26.102
help you sleep?

39:26.136 --> 39:30.570
Actually, I'm...

39:30.603 --> 39:32.703
I'm kinda scared to dream.

39:32.736 --> 39:35.469
That's silly.

39:35.503 --> 39:41.803
The thing a person needs most
at a time like this is sleep.

39:43.870 --> 39:48.703
And the thing a person
needs to do the most is forget.

40:24.937 --> 40:25.870
Bye!

40:25.903 --> 40:27.770
Bye, Mom!

40:29.870 --> 40:32.751
Oh, I forgot. I'm supposed
to stay after school

40:32.751 --> 40:34.150
and work
with my new lab partner,

40:34.183 --> 40:35.916
so can you pick me up at 4:30?

40:35.950 --> 40:38.516
Well, this is a heck of a time
to mention it, Ariel.

40:38.517 --> 40:39.917
I have the meeting
this afternoon.

40:39.950 --> 40:42.017
I know. I'm sorry.

40:42.050 --> 40:43.483
Um... wait.

40:43.517 --> 40:44.483
Nancy!

40:46.034 --> 40:47.849
Do you think your mom
could drop me at home

40:47.850 --> 40:48.883
after we're done working?

40:48.917 --> 40:50.284
Sure, I guess
that'd be okay.

40:50.317 --> 40:52.350
Mom, this is Nancy Claymore.

40:52.384 --> 40:53.650
She just started here this week.

40:53.683 --> 40:55.583
Hi, Mrs. Dubois.

40:55.616 --> 40:57.650
So her mom's

40:57.683 --> 40:59.117
gonna drop me
at home later, okay?

40:59.150 --> 41:01.284
Well, sure, that's okay.

41:01.317 --> 41:02.883
Nancy, you look so familiar.

41:02.917 --> 41:04.317
Have we met before?

41:04.350 --> 41:06.483
Um, I don't think so.

41:06.516 --> 41:09.516
Must be my imagination.
