WEBVTT

00:00.080 --> 00:01.330
- Previously on "Nashville"...

00:01.330 --> 00:02.830
- This idea of a midnight
release is a risk

00:02.830 --> 00:04.620
I don't think we should be
taking with your first single.

00:04.620 --> 00:06.170
- He wants you out.
- This is the way

00:06.170 --> 00:07.710
it's gonna have to be.
There's not way around it.

00:07.710 --> 00:09.290
- You found this girl
on the street.

00:09.290 --> 00:10.620
- That's why I brought her here.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.420
- You can stay,
until we figure something out.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.830
- I'm pregnant,
and you're the father.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.500
- You haven't even looked
at the bloody appetizers,

00:15.500 --> 00:17.170
and guess what?
I'm a father.

00:17.170 --> 00:18.790
- You're the best person I've
ever known.

00:18.790 --> 00:21.500
Please just say
you'll try with me.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.170
- I want my name next album
to be a gospel album.

00:24.170 --> 00:26.790
- You took a risk.
Sometimes that pays off,

00:26.790 --> 00:30.000
Sometimes...
- It blows up in your face.

00:33.210 --> 00:35.290
- Nope.
Can't see it.

00:35.290 --> 00:37.670
- Then you're blind.
Watch again.

00:39.670 --> 00:40.830
- It just--it looks
like nothing.

00:40.830 --> 00:42.330
Like maybe you
pulled a muscle.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.380
If you weren't
making me watch it,

00:43.380 --> 00:44.670
I would never be able to tell.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.670
Plus, you know how
easily suggestible I am.

00:47.670 --> 00:49.790
Plus, you're faking it.

00:49.790 --> 00:52.040
- I am not faking it.
- You are.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.580
Hey, how fast do you think
that plane was going

00:53.580 --> 00:54.620
when you hit the ground?

00:54.620 --> 00:56.620
- What?

00:56.620 --> 00:58.120
- All I'm saying is,

00:58.120 --> 01:00.330
stay focused on
the positive stuff, Jules.

01:00.330 --> 01:02.670
All things considered,
you're doing great. Come on.

01:02.670 --> 01:05.580
- Glenn, I don't want to hear
about how great I'm doing.

01:05.580 --> 01:07.790
I want to hear about
how great I am.

01:07.790 --> 01:10.290
- Okay. You do not
have to push yourself.

01:10.290 --> 01:12.330
You need to just stick to--

01:12.330 --> 01:14.170
- Don't start!

01:14.170 --> 01:15.670
I need a hit.

01:15.670 --> 01:18.380
That is the only way
that people forget a bomb.

01:18.380 --> 01:21.500
I need to make a new album.
And it better be a mindblower.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.500
You need to start looking
for new songs.

01:24.500 --> 01:27.670
And I don't want to be on a list
behind Miranda and Carrie

01:27.670 --> 01:29.540
and Kasey and Kelsea
and whatever.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.500
I want number one pick

01:31.500 --> 01:33.620
of the best of what's out there.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.120
And I'm gonna start
writing songs too.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.500
- (chuckles)
- What?

01:38.500 --> 01:40.670
- She's back.

01:45.380 --> 01:46.670
(text message rings)

01:49.120 --> 01:51.330
- Is that Damien?
- Yep.

01:52.710 --> 01:54.500
- What's he want?
(text message rings)

01:54.500 --> 01:55.960
- (sighs)

01:58.420 --> 02:00.790
- He's outside.

02:00.790 --> 02:02.420
- What's he doing outside?
(text messages continue)

02:02.420 --> 02:03.880
- Oh, he's at the door.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.040
- What?
Why doesn't he just knock?

02:07.040 --> 02:09.040
(knocking on door)

02:13.000 --> 02:15.960
- Ha, ha, ha!

02:15.960 --> 02:17.960
Can you believe it?
We are actually doing this.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.380
- What are we doing?

02:19.380 --> 02:20.880
- We're having a baby!

02:20.880 --> 02:22.620
Where's our little mum?

02:22.620 --> 02:25.580
Ah, there she is.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.000
How are you feeling?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.120
- Uh, surprised.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.170
- Look, I know I shouldn't
barge in on you like this.

02:31.170 --> 02:33.960
But, guys, we can do this.
And don't get me wrong.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.460
I'm not gonna interfere
with your lives.

02:35.460 --> 02:38.170
It's all gonna
be about the baby.

02:38.170 --> 02:40.790
Hello, Rupert.

02:40.790 --> 02:43.580
I mean, theoretically,
if it's a boy.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.790
We don't have to
decide that now.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.830
- Oh, good.
- I love you guys!

02:46.830 --> 02:48.380
I really do!

02:51.880 --> 02:55.830
(telephone rings)

02:57.670 --> 02:59.960
- Is any body...

02:59.960 --> 03:02.420
Highway 65?

03:02.420 --> 03:05.420
Oh, hey, Erika.
Yeah, it's Bucky.

03:05.420 --> 03:06.790
Ha, yeah.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.540
Deacon?

03:09.540 --> 03:13.380
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Yeah...

03:14.620 --> 03:15.670
- Oh, sorry.

03:15.670 --> 03:17.040
- I'm sorry.
Can you hold one second, please?

03:17.040 --> 03:18.500
What's up?

03:18.500 --> 03:20.420
- Yeah, that was
Erika at the Bluebird.

03:20.420 --> 03:21.710
She wants to know if you
might want to play

03:21.710 --> 03:23.500
a writers in the round
tomorrow night.

03:26.580 --> 03:28.920
- Let me call you right back.
All right, thanks.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.790
Tomorrow night?
- Yeah. Colin had to drop out.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.960
- You know, I don't know.
I got Daphne.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.710
I got this girl, I told you,
staying with us--it's just...

03:42.710 --> 03:44.500
why are you looking
at me like that, Buck?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.120
- Wha--How was I
looking at you?

03:46.120 --> 03:47.500
- What?
You think I should do it?

03:47.500 --> 03:49.670
- Well, yeah, of course,
if you want to.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.620
- I'll be honest, Buck,

03:54.620 --> 03:56.710
I haven't even touched
a guitar since...

03:58.830 --> 04:02.620
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
I'll call her back.

04:02.620 --> 04:03.880
- Wait. Hold on.

04:06.670 --> 04:08.420
Maybe I could
get a babysitter...

04:08.420 --> 04:09.830
- Well, I can bring
the girls if you want.

04:09.830 --> 04:11.540
- You don't have to do--
you know what?

04:11.540 --> 04:13.880
It's probably a bad idea.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.670
- I don't think it's a bad idea.

04:15.670 --> 04:17.920
I think it's a hard idea.

04:17.920 --> 04:21.460
You know how much Rayna loved
seeing you play at the Bluebird.

04:21.460 --> 04:22.920
She used to tell me she thought

04:22.920 --> 04:26.670
that was where you were
most at home, artistically.

04:26.670 --> 04:28.120
I just don't think
she'd want you

04:28.120 --> 04:30.710
to let that part of yourself go.

04:30.710 --> 04:32.500
I think she'd say
something like,

04:32.500 --> 04:35.960
"Hey, Deacon, you know,
you're made of music.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.620
It's the thing that's
always healed you.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.540
And it's the best part of you.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.670
And if you can gather yourself
and make yourself do it,

04:41.670 --> 04:45.920
you're gonna be
better off for it."

04:45.920 --> 04:48.670
Something like that.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.580
- That sounds about right.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.960
- Okay...

05:00.960 --> 05:02.670
Okay, I'll call Erika
and let her know.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.960
- Hey, Buck?

05:05.960 --> 05:07.620
I hope you know
I'm sorry as hell

05:07.620 --> 05:08.830
about the way things
turned out around here.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.000
I just hate it.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.830
- Yeah, I know.
Me too.

05:15.460 --> 05:16.920
- Bucky...

05:19.500 --> 05:23.790
thank you...
for everything.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.000
- New chapter.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.500
- (sighs) What if
nobody even plays it?

05:43.500 --> 05:45.000
That could happen.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.880
Or worse, what if they hear it
and they hate it?

05:47.880 --> 05:51.540
- Or what if they play it,
and everybody loves it?

05:51.540 --> 05:53.120
I mean, that could happen too.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.380
- I really hope so.

05:55.380 --> 05:57.790
I'm such a wreck.

05:57.790 --> 05:58.920
- Well, why don't you
play that thing

05:58.920 --> 06:01.040
you were working on before?

06:01.040 --> 06:02.670
I think you were getting
somewhere with it.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.540

- Say what?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.670
I wasn't gonna say anything.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.500
Since you brought it up,

07:43.500 --> 07:45.830
what does it mean,
"We're having a baby"?

07:47.500 --> 07:51.500
- Uh, well, he's the father.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
Beyond that, I have no idea.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.460
- Great.
Can't wait to find out.

07:56.460 --> 07:58.420

without a net here too.

07:58.420 --> 07:59.960

Scarlett?

07:59.960 --> 08:01.620
How do I fit into this?

08:01.620 --> 08:03.080
- None of us planned to be here,
Gunnar.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.960
Not you, not me,
sure as hell not Damien.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.830
But it's not about us.
It's about the baby.

08:08.830 --> 08:11.000
- Yeah, I wish
I could believe that.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.830
- What is that supposed to mean?

08:12.830 --> 08:14.120
- I mean, it's obvious.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.670
- Oh, you think I wanted this?

08:16.670 --> 08:18.670
- Again, how the hell
should I know?

08:18.670 --> 08:20.540
Figuring out what you want

08:20.540 --> 08:22.460
would take a team of
shrinks and mind readers

08:22.460 --> 08:24.540
working around the clock
year in and year out.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.170
And maybe, just maybe,
they might be able

08:26.170 --> 08:29.120
to come up with some idea
of what makes your mind work.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.080
Or what the hell it is you want!

08:31.080 --> 08:33.540
- Well, you're not
wrong about that.

Nope, not wrong at all.

08:48.670 --> 08:50.170
Where are all the good songs?

08:50.170 --> 08:52.960
- We're out to every
publisher in town.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.670
There's still stuff coming in.

08:54.670 --> 08:56.040
But there's a lot of people
recording right now.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.540
- Oh, my God.

08:57.540 --> 08:59.710
Am I gonna have to write
this whole record?

08:59.710 --> 09:01.540
Seriously, do I have to do
everything myself?

09:01.540 --> 09:05.000
- Like I said,
still shaking the trees.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.830
- You know, when I
get back from Kimmel,

09:06.830 --> 09:09.080
I want 10 great songs.

09:09.080 --> 09:12.000
- Oh.
- Oh?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.460
- Yeah...

09:14.460 --> 09:16.830
For the time being, that's off.
It was next on my list.

09:16.830 --> 09:18.830
- What the hell?
- Well, the thing is,

09:18.830 --> 09:20.460
there's really nothing
for us to promote right now.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.120
You probably don't wanna
blow an appearance

09:22.120 --> 09:23.620
until you have
a record coming out.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.170
- W-w-wait,
so you're telling me

09:25.170 --> 09:27.790
that they bumped me?
Or you cancelled it?

09:29.380 --> 09:30.500
- Let's split the difference.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.500
- They bumped me!?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.960
- No, no...
- Oh!

09:35.960 --> 09:39.380
- Well, at least you can get
started writing right away.

09:39.380 --> 09:41.500
- Do you hear that?

09:41.500 --> 09:43.670
- What?

09:43.670 --> 09:46.080
- You really don't hear that?

09:46.080 --> 09:50.080
That is the sound of the door
slamming on my career!

09:50.080 --> 09:51.620
- Juliette, it's not that...

09:51.620 --> 09:54.620
- And once that door closes,
it closes hard!

09:54.620 --> 09:56.500
And don't forget
that I'm a woman.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.670
Our comebacks don't come
until we're too old to care.

10:01.830 --> 10:03.960
What about Travis Stroud?

10:03.960 --> 10:05.960
- He's great.
He's busy.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.000
I don't think he can
jump right in.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.830
- Glenn, what's with
your attitude?

10:10.830 --> 10:13.500
Travis loves me!

10:13.500 --> 10:16.500
He does!
He loves me.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.670
We have written
some great tunes!

10:19.670 --> 10:21.670
You know, forget it.
Get me his number.

10:21.670 --> 10:24.000
And I will call him myself.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.380
- And welcome back.
We are with Maddie Jaymes.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.000
How's it going?
- It's going great.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.830
- Great. So you and your sister

10:33.830 --> 10:35.420
have been singing together
since you were little.

10:35.420 --> 10:37.420
You've performed at
the Grand Ole Opry.

10:37.420 --> 10:39.540
And some gigs with your parents.

10:39.540 --> 10:41.000
How does it feel to be
doing it all on your own?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.960
- Feels awesome.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.670
You know, I mean,
we still sing together.

10:44.670 --> 10:46.460
And we write sometimes too.

10:46.460 --> 10:49.460
- So you wowed everyone
at the CMT Music Awards

10:49.460 --> 10:51.500
with that heartbreaking
rendition

10:51.500 --> 10:53.620
of your late mother,
Rayna Jaymes', song.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.710
Are you going to cover
any of her other songs?

10:55.710 --> 10:58.920
- Um, I hadn't planned to.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.620
The stuff I'm writing is much
more pop than anything she--

11:01.620 --> 11:03.500
- Is it tougher to sing
now that she's gone?

11:03.500 --> 11:06.830
Do you think about her when
you're writing or performing?

11:06.830 --> 11:10.830
- Um, I'm not sure I really
understand what you're asking.

11:10.830 --> 11:15.000
Do you mean like in the moment?
When I'm recording the EP or...

11:15.000 --> 11:17.540
- Can you give us an idea
of what it's like

11:17.540 --> 11:19.000
when your mother is a mega star

11:19.000 --> 11:21.670
beloved by her fans for decades?

11:21.670 --> 11:25.080
How it feels to try
to fill those boots?

11:25.080 --> 11:27.960
- Um...

11:29.880 --> 11:31.670
I couldn't.

11:35.380 --> 11:38.080
- Hurry up, girls!
Time to go!

11:38.080 --> 11:40.500
(girls giggle)

11:40.500 --> 11:41.790
What is on your face?

11:41.790 --> 11:43.920
- Makeup...nothing.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.580
- You can't wear that
to the Bluebird, sweetie.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.040
Come on, take it off.
I'm gonna be late.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.000
- Okay. Can we just stay here?
Because we wanna watch a movie.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.120
- No you can't stay here, honey.
- Why not?

11:51.120 --> 11:53.880
- Because your sister's not here
and you don't have a babysitter.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.500
I told you you're going.
Now let's go.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.000
- Wait, we're just gonna
sit on that sofa.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.920
And watch a movie.
- I know where the sofa is.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.500
- I think he's afraid that
I'm gonna steal something.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.170
Or make you smoke or do drugs.

12:02.170 --> 12:03.920
I won't.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.000
- Okay, seriously, what
do you think's gonna happen?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.750
Think we're gonna
burn the house down?

12:07.750 --> 12:09.040
I don't know if you remember,
we tried that once.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.000
And it didn't work.
- Okay, stop.

12:13.790 --> 12:16.710
Promise me,
you won't do anything.

12:16.710 --> 12:18.120
I will be back in two hours.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.670
Your butts will be
on that sofa, or else.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.540
- We swear.
- (clicks tongue)

12:29.120 --> 12:30.460
- (sighs) Oh, my God.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.620
- That's Gary Nicholson,
everybody.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.830
- Thank you.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.620
- Well, Jessie, now that
you've heard the competition,

12:47.620 --> 12:48.960
You must be feeling pretty good.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.830
- (laughs)

12:50.830 --> 12:52.500
- The good thing about us
is we're not that hard to top.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.380
- Oh, I don't know about that.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.620
- You're all in
for a real treat right now.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.380
Most of y'all probably know
Jessie's music.

12:58.380 --> 12:59.960
But you might not know, she used
to be a real regular here.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.670
Played here all the time.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.000
- I was...

13:03.000 --> 13:04.620
but I took a little break
for a while,

13:04.620 --> 13:07.000
to go ruin my life, so...
(audience chuckles)

13:07.000 --> 13:08.620
- It's the country music
thing to do.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.460
- Exactly.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.000
- Well, she's back and
we're glad to have you here

13:12.000 --> 13:13.920
with your fellow train wrecks
safe at the Bluebird.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.880
Jessie Caine, everybody.

13:18.080 --> 13:21.080
- Thank you. Thanks.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.080
- Thank you, Jessie.

14:21.080 --> 14:25.670
- I know you two had a, uh...
complicated time too.

14:25.670 --> 14:27.830
- Yeah.

14:27.830 --> 14:29.920
Just got to be thankful

14:29.920 --> 14:32.960
for the time we had
together now, you know.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.080
She was the love of my life.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.670
- I know.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.670
- It's okay.
You got him back on track.

14:40.670 --> 14:42.000
- Barely.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.670
It's like the only reason
he wanted me on the show

14:43.670 --> 14:45.540
was to ask about my mom.

14:45.540 --> 14:47.750
How could he think
I could even talk about it

14:47.750 --> 14:50.170
without completely losing it?

14:50.170 --> 14:52.420
It just makes me so mad.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.000
- You know,

14:54.000 --> 14:55.670
you don't have to keep
subjecting yourself to this.

14:55.670 --> 14:58.420
I mean, maybe you should
let some time pass

14:58.420 --> 14:59.830
before you do this stuff.

14:59.830 --> 15:02.670
Just let people hear your music,
you know?

15:02.670 --> 15:04.000
(siren)

15:04.000 --> 15:05.620
Oh, no.
- Are you kidding me?

15:05.620 --> 15:07.920
Why are they pulling us over?

15:07.920 --> 15:10.000
- I have no idea.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
All right, just be cool.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.710
- Good evening.

15:24.710 --> 15:26.170
Do you know why
I pulled you over?

15:26.170 --> 15:27.790
- Uh, no, sir, I do not.

15:27.790 --> 15:30.420
- You did a rolling stop
back there.

15:30.420 --> 15:32.380
- Uh, back where, sir?
- May I see your license,

15:32.380 --> 15:34.880
insurance, and
vehicle registration, please?

15:34.880 --> 15:37.000
- You didn't roll through
any stop signs.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.170
- Uh, my license
is in my wallet.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.500
And my registration and
insurance is in the glove box.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.380
Is it okay if I reach for it?

15:43.380 --> 15:44.830
- But, which stop sign
did we roll through?

15:44.830 --> 15:46.170
Because we didn't.
We stopped at all of them.

15:46.170 --> 15:47.960
- Honey, I got this.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.880
- No. I just want to know which
stop sign we rolled through.

15:52.170 --> 15:55.920
- Okay, I'm gonna open
my glove box now.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.620
- This is crazy.
Why won't you answer me?

15:57.620 --> 15:58.710
- Ma'am, please be quiet.

15:58.710 --> 16:00.710
- I'm just asking a question.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.120
Why won't you answer?

16:02.120 --> 16:04.750
- What's your business
in this area?

16:04.750 --> 16:07.500
- What?
- Wait. It's in here somewhere.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.040
- What do you mean, what's our
business in this area?

16:09.040 --> 16:11.620
What is that supposed to mean?

16:11.620 --> 16:12.710
- Here.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.380
- We're being stopped
by this cop for no reason.

16:23.380 --> 16:25.460
What's your name, officer?

16:25.460 --> 16:27.120
- Look, Maddie...
- No.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.120
I'm asking which stop sign
we supposedly rolled through.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.670
And he can't give us
a simple answer.

16:32.670 --> 16:34.620
- Would you mind stepping out
of the vehicle, please?

16:34.620 --> 16:36.710
- Look, officer,
if it's all the same to you,

16:36.710 --> 16:38.790
I'd really prefer not to.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.380
People are starting to film us.

16:40.380 --> 16:41.880
- Why do you want him
to get out of the car?

16:41.880 --> 16:44.920
For rolling through a stop sign?
This is crazy.

16:44.920 --> 16:49.500
- Okay, officer, I'm gonna exit
the vehicle as you suggested.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.330
I'm just gonna take off
my seatbelt now.

16:52.710 --> 16:54.620
- God. Why are you
making him get out?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.040
- Step over here, please.

17:02.830 --> 17:04.830
Ma'am, please stay in the car.
- You want him to get out?

17:04.830 --> 17:06.170
Why didn't you
ask me to get out?

17:06.170 --> 17:07.670
Because he's black?
Is that why?

17:07.670 --> 17:10.120
Because he's not
driving a Range Rover?

17:10.120 --> 17:11.790
Why is there one rule for him
and one for me?

17:11.790 --> 17:13.670
He did nothing wrong!

17:13.670 --> 17:15.670
- Ma'am, do not come over here!
- Maddie, get back in the car.

17:15.670 --> 17:17.120
- If you don't comply, we're
gonna be forced to restrain you.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.670
- Stop right there!
- This is insane.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.670
- He did nothing wrong!
- Get back in the car.

17:20.670 --> 17:21.920
- Stop.
- Maddie, seriously.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.960
- Cuff her.
- This is insane!

17:23.960 --> 17:26.080
- Don't touch him!
- No just, wait a second.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.670
- Cuff her.
We'll finish this downtown.

17:27.670 --> 17:29.170
- Are you serious?
Are you kidding me?

17:29.170 --> 17:31.000
- No, ma'am, I'm not.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.460
You're being detained for
failure to follow my command.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.710
- You know, I think I was 15

17:41.710 --> 17:43.710
the first time
I heard y'all play.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.830
I remember looking up
to the stage, and thinking

17:45.830 --> 17:48.000
I really hope I find
a love like that someday.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.080
- That's really sweet.
Thank you.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.830
- Yeah.

17:50.830 --> 17:52.620
- We were all pretty young
back then, especially you.

17:52.620 --> 17:55.830
- Yeah, well,
I sure as hell ain't now.

17:55.830 --> 17:57.710
- Good to see you back.
You been gone too long.

17:57.710 --> 18:01.710
- Yeah, and I'm sure you've
heard all the reasons why.

18:01.710 --> 18:04.460
- Well, I don't much
go in for gossip, so...

18:04.460 --> 18:07.830
- Well, whatever you did hear,
it was worse.

18:07.830 --> 18:10.670
Divorce is not for sissies.
- So I hear.

18:10.670 --> 18:11.920
- But what's done is done,
I guess.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.670
(phone rings)

18:13.670 --> 18:16.040
It's complicated, yeah.
- Thanks.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.670
- Hi, sweet pea.
What's going on?

18:21.710 --> 18:22.830
You what?

18:24.670 --> 18:26.000
- It was a complete joke
that we even got stopped!

18:26.000 --> 18:27.290
- Maddie...

18:27.290 --> 18:28.830
- He said we were rolling
through a stop sign?

18:28.830 --> 18:30.670
Which we definitely were not!

18:30.670 --> 18:32.670
- That is not the point!
Don't do that!

18:32.670 --> 18:35.120
You're lucky as hell
they didn't charge you.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.830
You okay?

18:36.830 --> 18:38.790
- Yes, sir.
Just a little shaken up.

18:38.790 --> 18:40.880
- Yeah, I shouldn't wonder.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.920
- I was just standing up
for our rights.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.620
- That's not how you do it.

18:47.830 --> 18:49.500
- Travis!

18:49.500 --> 18:51.040
- Girl, you are a sight
for sore eyes.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.620
- There you go, baby.
- Thank you.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.670
- Thank you for finding time
to see me today.

18:55.670 --> 18:57.500
- Of course.
- Congratulations!

18:57.500 --> 18:59.040
You've been sweeping up!

18:59.040 --> 19:01.540
I mean, five number ones
in a year?

19:01.540 --> 19:03.000
- I'm having a good run.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.500
Glad to see
you're back up and at 'em.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.120
- Well, you know,
can't keep a bad girl down.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.790
- There's a song right there.

19:09.790 --> 19:11.380
- Let's write it.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.000
I'm gonna start
working on a new record.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.500
I'm hoping you can share a
little bit of the old magic.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.000
I've got a few ideas I've been
kicking around in my head.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.670
- I bet you do.
After all you've been through?

19:19.670 --> 19:21.460
If you can't come up
with a song idea out of that,

19:21.460 --> 19:22.790
you might as well hang it up.

19:22.790 --> 19:24.790
- (laughs)
- Hey!

19:24.790 --> 19:27.880
You're close with Rayna's
daughter, Maddie, aren't you?

19:27.880 --> 19:29.670
- Yeah, very.

19:29.670 --> 19:33.080
- I've got a song I think
will be great for her.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.960
It's pretty pop,
so she sprang to mind.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.920
But it's a stone hit
if I've ever heard one.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.000
Would love to get it to her.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.420
What's the best way to do that,
do you think?

19:42.420 --> 19:44.170
- I'm happy to pass it along.

19:44.170 --> 19:45.710
- That'd be great.

19:45.710 --> 19:48.670
I will send you an MP3 as well.

19:48.670 --> 19:51.170
- All right.
- Yeah.

19:51.170 --> 19:52.670
Let's hear what you got.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.960
- Why can't you just tell us
where we're going?

19:58.960 --> 20:00.830
- Curiosity killed the cat.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.880
- I'm sure the cat died
in a car accident.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.580
- Or of fright.
Wrong side! Wrong side!

20:04.580 --> 20:06.830
(horn honking)

20:06.830 --> 20:09.080
- Ha ha. Oops.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.040
What'd you think
of the name Rupert?

20:11.040 --> 20:12.670
It was my grandfather's name.
I mean, if it's a boy.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.670
- Okay, would you
slow down a little bit?

20:14.670 --> 20:16.000
On everything?

20:17.500 --> 20:19.460
- It's perfect!
I already made an offer.

20:19.460 --> 20:20.960
And there's plenty of room.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.830
This way, I can
be here for Rupert.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.670
- I really wish you'd
stop calling him that.

20:24.670 --> 20:25.960
- I mean, if we're
gonna co-parent,

20:25.960 --> 20:27.500
it makes a lot of sense,
doesn't it?

20:27.500 --> 20:30.000
- You want to live here?
- I mean, for a while.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.830
At least until
we send him to Eton.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.080
Every man in my family has
been there for generations.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.790
Come on.
Take a look around.

20:43.670 --> 20:46.460
- What do you think?
- About which part?

20:46.460 --> 20:48.080
I mean, this house?
Rupert?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.710
Who's, apparently, going to go
to Eton and play cricket.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.080
And have crumpets, or what,
a lot of little bottles?

20:52.080 --> 20:55.460
Cheerio governor!

20:55.460 --> 20:57.120
I don't know what
the hell to think...

20:57.120 --> 20:58.620
of any of this.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.710
- Oh, my God!
- (laughing)

21:05.710 --> 21:07.960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.540
- Daphne, think fast!

21:09.540 --> 21:13.120
- Oh, my God!
- (laughs)

21:13.120 --> 21:14.670
- Hey, Daph,
can I talk to you a sec?

21:16.500 --> 21:18.040
- Yeah. Sorry.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.670
- Look, sweetie,
Liv is a nice girl.

21:28.670 --> 21:30.170
And I know y'all are
having a great time.

21:30.170 --> 21:31.670
But I just need you to know

21:31.670 --> 21:33.170
that this can't
stay like this forever.

21:33.170 --> 21:35.080
- Dad, she did nothing wrong.
She's helping.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.460
- I didn't say she did anything
wrong. I know she didn't--

21:37.460 --> 21:39.040
- So you're gonna put her
back in the streets?

21:39.040 --> 21:43.380
- No....Look.
We know she has parents.

21:43.380 --> 21:45.500
We know that now.
- No, no, she doesn't.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.460
She has two drug addicts

21:47.460 --> 21:48.790
that don't care where she is
or who she's with.

21:48.790 --> 21:50.580
Parents?
No, that's not what she has.

21:50.580 --> 21:52.040
- We don't know
her real situation.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.500
- You don't believe me?
- It's not you.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.670
- Fine. Kick her out.

21:56.670 --> 21:58.500
She'll go back to the river.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.000
And who knows
what will happen to her.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.580
But you tell her.
I'm not doing it.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.670
- I'm not kicking her out.

22:04.670 --> 22:07.380
I'm just saying
she can't stay here forever.

22:07.380 --> 22:09.120
We'll figure it out.
I'll talk to people.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.580
We'll find out our rights.
We'll find out her rights.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.960
- Thank you.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.000
- Oh, my God!

22:15.000 --> 22:17.960
- No! He did nothing wrong!
- Oh, my God...

22:17.960 --> 22:20.460
- It's online.
- What?

22:22.670 --> 22:25.500
- This is insane
What are you doing?

22:25.500 --> 22:29.000
Are you kidding me?
- No, ma'am, I'm not.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.580
- These comments
are really mean!

22:30.580 --> 22:32.580
(phone rings)
- What? What are they saying?

22:32.580 --> 22:33.960
- Nothing.
It doesn't matter what they're..

22:33.960 --> 22:35.620
- Yes, it does matter!
- No, don't read the comments!

22:35.620 --> 22:38.920
And you do not respond!

22:38.920 --> 22:42.000
Hello?
- It's on the news?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.040
- You got the wrong number!
Don't answer your phone.

22:46.380 --> 22:48.120
Stop.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.920
- This is a nightmare.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.960
- And this can be his--

22:57.960 --> 23:01.420
I mean, the baby's room.

23:01.420 --> 23:05.040
And it connects to this lovely
little room for the nanny.

23:05.040 --> 23:08.420
I know it's unorthodox.
But so is everything these days.

23:08.420 --> 23:11.620
I really think
this can work, guys.

23:11.620 --> 23:14.960
- I think I'm gonna
check out the back yard.

23:18.170 --> 23:19.670
- This is all
really overwhelming.

23:19.670 --> 23:22.040
- I know.
- (chuckles)

23:22.040 --> 23:24.120
- Scarlett, I am really ashamed

23:24.120 --> 23:27.500
of how I reacted
when you told me the news.

23:27.500 --> 23:30.500
Because it is great news.
And I'm really happy.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.500
I wasn't contemplating
being a father any time soon.

23:32.500 --> 23:36.000
But we all have to
grow up sometime.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.120
I think you'll be
a spectacular mum.

23:38.120 --> 23:41.500
- I've had zero training, so...

23:44.460 --> 23:46.960
(both chuckling)

23:46.960 --> 23:49.460
- It doesn't show yet.

23:50.710 --> 23:53.750
- I think this can work.

23:53.750 --> 23:57.000
By this, I mean, this house,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.710
you and me,
and baby makes three.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.710
- Are you asking me
to live here with you?

24:10.710 --> 24:13.000
- I'm saying if you want to.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.710
If you want to start
a real little family,

24:15.710 --> 24:16.920
I think we can do this.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.880
- I think I need some time
to think about this.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.580
- Of course.
Take your time.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.120
- Excuse me!
Are you Clayton Carter?

25:00.120 --> 25:01.790
- Well, who are you?

25:01.790 --> 25:03.420
- Are you Maddie Conrad's
boyfriend?

25:03.420 --> 25:05.830
- Whoa! Excuse me?
- How would you characterize

25:05.830 --> 25:08.040
your relationship to Maddie?
- I don't know you, man, okay?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.620
I've never seen you
before in my life.

25:09.620 --> 25:11.620
Why would I answer a bunch of
questions from a total stranger?

25:11.620 --> 25:13.620
- Okay, so you're not denying
there's a romantic relationship?

25:13.620 --> 25:15.500
- Wait, what? No.
I mean, yes.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.830
I deny that.
Look, she's just a friend, okay?

25:18.830 --> 25:20.790
Someone I play music with.
That's all.

25:20.790 --> 25:23.080
- How long have you known her?
- I said that's all!

25:23.080 --> 25:24.830
Okay, do you want
to have a problem?

25:24.830 --> 25:26.120
Just keep on asking questions.

25:26.120 --> 25:29.460
- Yeah, but...
- Don't follow me!

25:51.620 --> 25:53.040
- Meanwhile, Maddie Jaymes,

25:53.040 --> 25:55.120
daughter of the much mourned
country super star,

25:55.120 --> 25:57.080
Rayna Jaymes,
was arrested last night

25:57.080 --> 26:00.380
after an altercation
with police in Nashville. Watch.

26:00.380 --> 26:02.000
- No, he did nothing wrong!
- Ma'am, if you don't...

26:02.000 --> 26:03.080
- This is insane!

26:03.080 --> 26:04.830
- Maddie, look,

26:04.830 --> 26:06.880
this whole thing can blow over
in a few days, okay?

26:06.880 --> 26:09.040
We're drafting you
a press release.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.790
And we can go over it
with you before.

26:10.790 --> 26:12.420
You'll have full say
on everything.

26:12.420 --> 26:13.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.830
- Hope I'm not interrupting.

26:15.830 --> 26:17.670
- Not at all.
We were just...

26:17.670 --> 26:18.960
- I'm here to see her.

26:18.960 --> 26:22.920
- Right, yeah. Sorry.

26:22.920 --> 26:26.000
I'll see about...something.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.540
- Thank you.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.710
Well, girl, you have made
quite a splash.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.710
- It's so not funny, Juliette.

26:35.710 --> 26:37.880
- I know, I know.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.460
It feels like the whole world
is looking at you.

26:40.460 --> 26:42.830
But do you feel like
you did something wrong?

26:42.830 --> 26:44.830
- No, I don't!
That's the thing.

26:44.830 --> 26:46.380
It just looks like I did.

26:46.380 --> 26:47.790
- If you feel
all right about it,

26:47.790 --> 26:49.710
then great.
Own it.

26:49.710 --> 26:52.080
Stand up and take
whatever comes.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.670
I know you have heard
the expression,

26:54.670 --> 26:58.880
"There is no such thing
as bad publicity", right?

26:58.880 --> 27:00.830
Well, in this day and age,
it's the truth.

27:00.830 --> 27:02.670
I'm not saying it's right.

27:02.670 --> 27:06.830
But at least you've gotten
everyone's attention.

27:06.830 --> 27:08.670
Now you just need
to handle it with grace.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.710
And it'll all be fine.

27:10.710 --> 27:12.330
- It really does not feel
like that right now.

27:14.920 --> 27:17.380
- It is going to be fine, babe.

27:17.380 --> 27:20.750
I promise you.
Okay?

27:23.920 --> 27:25.830
- You busy?

27:31.920 --> 27:34.960
Hey.

27:40.670 --> 27:42.620
Wouldn't you like to
talk about all this?

27:42.620 --> 27:44.830
- I think if you got
something you wanna say,

27:44.830 --> 27:46.500
you should say it.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.830
There's obviously something
on your mind.

27:47.830 --> 27:51.460
- Please don't be short with me,
Gunnar.

27:51.460 --> 27:53.170
He asked me live with him.

27:53.170 --> 27:56.670
- I didn't ask.
- But you wanted to, so I'm...

27:56.670 --> 27:59.420
- And what did you say?

27:59.420 --> 28:01.620
I only want to know
because right now,

28:01.620 --> 28:04.620
I feel like a man
without a country.

28:04.620 --> 28:08.670
You want to go live
in that mansion, go ahead.

28:08.670 --> 28:10.830
You want to be
with the guy, go do it,

28:10.830 --> 28:12.120
if that's what you really want.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.000
But if it's not,
tell me it's not.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.790
Just tell me the truth.

28:17.710 --> 28:19.040
- You say that like it's not

28:19.040 --> 28:21.420
what I've been doing
this whole time.

28:21.420 --> 28:22.750
- Such a simple question!

28:22.750 --> 28:26.040
Do you have feelings
for the guy or not?

28:26.040 --> 28:28.920
- Yeah.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.080
I would be lying to you

28:31.080 --> 28:33.540
if I said I didn't
feel anything for him.

28:33.540 --> 28:35.380
And I'd be lying
if I said I was happy

28:35.380 --> 28:36.960
about how all this came out.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.120
But I don't know
what's right anymore.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.380
So I'm just trying...

28:41.380 --> 28:43.380
- I know what's not right.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.540
You got to give up something.

28:45.540 --> 28:48.040
So just let me know
when you decide.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.500
- Maddie?

29:02.500 --> 29:04.170
- No, it's just me.

29:04.170 --> 29:07.380
Is she not here?
She's who I was coming to see.

29:07.380 --> 29:09.920
- Not home yet.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.830
- How's she doing?

29:11.830 --> 29:16.040
- Well, she, you know,
freaked out.

29:16.040 --> 29:20.120
Upset...
Her life is basically over.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.790
- Yeah, I know
just how she feels.

29:21.790 --> 29:25.000
- Don't we all.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.920
- (crying)

29:29.710 --> 29:33.670
- Listen, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

29:33.670 --> 29:35.920
- Come on, now.
What? Tell me?

29:35.920 --> 29:39.040
- It's really not a big deal.

29:39.040 --> 29:43.500
Sorry...

29:43.500 --> 29:45.670
Damien wants to buy
a mansion in Nashville

29:45.670 --> 29:47.830
so the three of us
can co-parent together

29:47.830 --> 29:50.000
until such time as
the baby named Rupert

29:50.000 --> 29:53.120
goes to prep school
and learns to play cricket.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.500
And I swear to God I wish
I was having puppies.

29:55.500 --> 29:56.790
Because then I could
give one to everybody.

29:56.790 --> 30:00.500
And we could all
go on our merry way.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.120
- It would uncomplicate
things considerably.

30:03.120 --> 30:06.000
- A little bit.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.500
- How's that make you feel,

30:07.500 --> 30:09.000
him being here
and Gunnar and all?

30:09.000 --> 30:12.500
- How would you feel?

30:12.500 --> 30:13.920
- I don't know.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.960
- What to say,

30:15.960 --> 30:17.580
or whether to be happy or sad,

30:17.580 --> 30:20.500
or just totally freak out.

30:20.500 --> 30:23.880
Yeah, I'm right there with you.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.380
- You want a hug or something?

30:26.380 --> 30:27.670
- God, no.
Anybody touches me,

30:27.670 --> 30:29.040
I'll start crying
and can't stop.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.880
It's horrible.
Thank you.

30:33.580 --> 30:35.170
- You got any idea
what you're gonna do?

30:35.170 --> 30:36.830
- None whatsoever.

30:36.830 --> 30:41.000
I actually think this is
some kind of karmic payback.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.120
I never understood
when people would say

30:43.120 --> 30:47.380
they love more than one person.

30:47.380 --> 30:52.080
I thought it was
a load of crap, and...

30:52.080 --> 30:54.880
I guess I am that person.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.670
Shows how much I know.

30:56.670 --> 30:59.580
Joke's on me.
Ha-ha.

30:59.580 --> 31:03.830
- How's Gunnar?
- Crushed.

31:03.830 --> 31:06.000
- I guess all you can do

31:06.000 --> 31:08.500
is just keep being honest
with everybody,

31:08.500 --> 31:11.000
especially yourself.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.540
Just let the chips
fall where they may.

31:16.790 --> 31:18.920
- I'll have that hug now.
- Gotcha.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.750
- How you holding up, baby?

31:26.750 --> 31:30.500
- What else can I do?
- I know, I know.

31:30.500 --> 31:34.080
The whole situation
is so messed up.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.540
- Hey, thanks for always
being there for me, Ruby.

31:36.540 --> 31:37.880
- Hey, you know
I always will be.

31:42.790 --> 31:45.710
I'll leave you to it.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.790
- Why'd you want
to meet me here?

31:52.790 --> 31:55.580
- Because there are reporters
outside of my door.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.960
I can't get home.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.880
- So sorry.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.460
How did they find out
where you live?

32:00.460 --> 32:03.620
- I don't know, Maddie.
They followed me.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.120
It seems like everywhere I go,
people keep asking me about you.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.920
More to the point,
you and me.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.420
- What do you tell them?

32:12.420 --> 32:15.080
- Look, I tell them
we're just friends.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.170
Just someone I play music with.

32:18.170 --> 32:21.830
- Is that true?
Why would you say that?

32:21.830 --> 32:24.620
- Because that's the way
it needs to be.

32:24.620 --> 32:26.080
- What do you mean?

32:26.080 --> 32:28.080
- Look, I can't deal with any--
- No, I'm sorry.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.620
I'm really sorry, Clay.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.000
I was not trying
to start any of this.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.580
I was just so mad at the guy
who was pulling us over.

32:33.580 --> 32:35.120
And I was trying to protect you.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.880
- Look, I know, okay?
I know.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.500
Have you ever read
James Baldwin's book,

32:44.500 --> 32:47.080
"Another Country"?
- No.

32:47.080 --> 32:50.000
- You should.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.500
We live in two
different worlds, Maddie.

32:53.500 --> 32:54.960
I get it, okay?
I get it.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.670
You were just trying
to stand up for me.

32:57.670 --> 33:00.000
But I could've
gotten shot, okay?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
That's what I have
to think about.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.500
Not whether or not I did or
didn't run through a stop sign.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.120
But am I gonna
get out of this alive?

33:06.120 --> 33:09.880
- Oh, my God.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.620
- I just think,
I need some time for now.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.120
- Are you saying you don't
care about me?

33:20.120 --> 33:21.670
- No.

33:21.670 --> 33:25.000
Okay, I'm absolutely
not saying that.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.170
I'm saying if I care about you

33:28.170 --> 33:30.710
and you care about me,

33:30.710 --> 33:34.000
you just let me
by myself for now.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.920
- Sorry.
You been waiting long?

33:43.920 --> 33:45.500
- Not really.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.920
- Can we walk?
- Sure.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.500
I'm assuming you had some
thoughts about my proposal.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.040
Good things, I hope.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.830
- Yeah, I did.

33:57.830 --> 34:00.830
It's an amazing house.
- Isn't it?

34:00.830 --> 34:03.500
- Yeah, and you're
a really wonderful person.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.540
You surprised me.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.500
You're so much fun
in all the best ways.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.000
And I think that
you really would like

34:11.000 --> 34:13.670
to be that guy
who lives in that house.

34:13.670 --> 34:16.540
And be a good daddy
and a good whatever.

34:16.540 --> 34:19.000
- I would like to be that guy.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.830
- But let's be real.

34:20.830 --> 34:23.040
You're not that guy, are you?

34:23.040 --> 34:24.790
- See, this is why
you're amazing.

34:24.790 --> 34:26.880
This is why I think
I could be that guy.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.580
Because we haven't known
each other that long.

34:28.580 --> 34:30.500
And already you know me better
than any woman ever has.

34:35.670 --> 34:39.500
- Still, you're not
that guy, are you?

34:40.670 --> 34:44.620
- We don't know that, do we?

34:44.620 --> 34:48.330
- Yeah, we kind of do know that.

34:49.710 --> 34:50.880
- I don't know. Do we?

34:55.960 --> 34:57.960
All right, uh,

34:57.960 --> 34:59.500
if we're being completely
honest with ourselves,

34:59.500 --> 35:03.000
which I hate to be,
I suppose we do know.

35:05.830 --> 35:07.580
- Walk away. Go.
Walk.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.540
- Scarlett...
- I said walk, not talk. Go.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.830
- Please!
Well, don't be angry.

35:11.830 --> 35:15.040
It's not good for the baby.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.790
I still love you.

35:50.380 --> 35:53.120
- I'm good, thank you.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.880
Listen, this is one of those
good news-bad news calls.

35:55.880 --> 35:58.790
I played the song for Maddie.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.830
And she doesn't think
that it's quite right for her.

36:00.830 --> 36:02.580
- Wow. It's a hit, for sure.

36:02.580 --> 36:05.000
- I know, I know.
I was surprised too.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.540
Because I think it's incredible.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.880
- I really believe in it.

36:07.880 --> 36:11.170
- So, listen, what if
I record the song,

36:11.170 --> 36:13.000
and I put it on my album?

36:13.000 --> 36:15.670
- If you think it's in
your wheelhouse, do it.

36:15.670 --> 36:19.830
- Great, good.
I will have Glenn call.

36:19.830 --> 36:21.790
- When do you think
you and I could write again?

36:21.790 --> 36:23.920
- Soon.
I have to run now,

36:23.920 --> 36:26.330
but I'm excited.
Bye, Juliette.

36:29.710 --> 36:30.880
- (sighs)

36:30.880 --> 36:32.670
(knock on door)
- Who is it?

36:32.670 --> 36:35.790
- Can I come in?
- No. It's okay.

36:35.790 --> 36:37.620
- Okay, I'm coming in.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.000
- No.
That's not what I meant.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.620
- I know what you meant.

36:41.620 --> 36:43.460
Come here.

36:46.670 --> 36:49.580
- I can't believe
all this is happening.

36:49.580 --> 36:51.500
I was really just trying
to stand up for him.

36:51.500 --> 36:55.830
- I know that.
He knows it too.

36:55.830 --> 36:58.580
- No one else does.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.000
They all think
I'm this spoiled brat.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.500
- Oh, come on...
- I know.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.500
Disrespected the cops.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.710
And they think I'm the worst.
And so does Clay.

37:05.710 --> 37:07.960
- No, he does not.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.460
- He doesn't want
to see me anymore.

37:11.460 --> 37:14.460
He thinks we should
just be friends.

37:14.460 --> 37:18.000
You know what that means.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.670
- Maybe it's not such
a bad idea right now.

37:20.670 --> 37:24.080
Just take a little break.
And let things blow over.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.960
- This isn't going to blow over.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.460
He thinks I ruined his life.

37:28.460 --> 37:31.830
And, honestly, maybe I have.

37:31.830 --> 37:35.670
- I know it probably
seems like that right now.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.670
But you haven't ruined anything.

37:37.670 --> 37:39.670
- I care so much about him.

37:39.670 --> 37:40.920
- I know.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.500
- I really thought
he cared about me.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.500
You know, we never even had sex.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.960
It never even got that far.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.710
And that's just
who he is, you know.

37:52.710 --> 37:56.830
He's always protecting me.

37:56.830 --> 38:00.880
And I just destroyed
any shot we could have.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.670
- Come on, now.

38:02.670 --> 38:05.420
Hey, look,
I know this probably ain't gonna

38:05.420 --> 38:07.080
make you feel
any better right now.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.790
But I've learned some lessons in
all these mistakes I made.

38:09.790 --> 38:11.670
One thing is for sure, babe.

38:11.670 --> 38:14.830
Life is long and things change.

38:14.830 --> 38:18.830
Nothing stays the same forever.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.830
You know that by now.

38:23.670 --> 38:24.960
Baby doll,
when it comes to love,

38:24.960 --> 38:27.380
if it's not meant to be,

38:27.380 --> 38:29.170
there's nothing in the world
that can make it happen.

38:29.170 --> 38:33.380
But if it is, ain't nothing
in the world can stop it.
