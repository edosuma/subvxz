00:01.000 --> 00:02.763
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:02.800 --> 00:04.768
- Why are you here?
- Police asked me to stay.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.597
I'm talking about the funeral,
if Charlotte was as horrible

00:06.640 --> 00:08.392
as you told the judge
she was, why did you go?

00:08.440 --> 00:10.101
Did you lie in court?
Was it all an act?

00:10.140 --> 00:11.232
So you could
walk out like a victim?

00:11.270 --> 00:13.238
Do you have feelings for--

00:13.280 --> 00:14.770
I don't even know
if he feels the same way.

00:14.810 --> 00:17.370
(Hanna)
I think that
you should find out.

00:21.350 --> 00:23.079
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you want.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.280
I know you're lost right now.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.049
I know you're,
you're filled with anger

00:26.090 --> 00:27.250
and you're full of despair--

00:27.290 --> 00:28.484
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:28.520 --> 00:29.521
Charlotte, I know that

00:29.560 --> 00:30.527
you did this to protect me.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.518
What the hell
was Ezra doing there?

00:34.860 --> 00:36.396
(Hanna)
What's wrong? Who's that from?

00:36.430 --> 00:37.761
(Ashley)
It's from Detective Calderon.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.791
They just confirmed
that the tape was erased.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.364
He needs to own up
to what he did!

00:41.400 --> 00:43.630
You're asking me
to confess to a murder.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.763
Where did you go that night
after you left Aria?

00:45.810 --> 00:47.505
- Get out!
- 'We're gonna leave.'

00:47.540 --> 00:49.246
But you two better
figure this out.

00:50.610 --> 00:54.239
* I just kept hoping

00:54.280 --> 00:57.113
* I just kept hoping

00:57.150 --> 01:00.119
* The way would become clear

01:04.490 --> 01:07.425
* I spent all this time

01:08.800 --> 01:11.360
* Tryna play nice

01:11.400 --> 01:14.563
* And fight my way here

01:18.810 --> 01:23.247
* See I've been having me
a real hard time *

01:23.280 --> 01:26.113
* But it feels so nice

01:26.150 --> 01:29.540
* To know I'm gonna be alright

01:33.860 --> 01:37.785
* So Ijust kept dreaming

01:37.830 --> 01:41.254
* Yeah I just kept dreaming

01:41.300 --> 01:43.564
* It wasn't very hard

01:48.470 --> 01:52.304
* I spent all this time

01:52.340 --> 01:55.730
* Tryna figure out why

01:55.780 --> 01:58.305
* Nobody on my side *

02:01.480 --> 02:04.415
[intense music]

02:14.260 --> 02:15.625
You guys, I'm so sorry.

02:15.660 --> 02:16.319
I was up late last night

02:16.370 --> 02:17.723
prepping for town hall meeting.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.795
I turned my phone off.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.932
Who the hell sent that?

02:20.970 --> 02:22.528
Someone who has our new number.

02:22.570 --> 02:25.368
Like Ali? We all know I am
at the top of her suspect list.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.503
Maybe that's why
Sara's hanging around.

02:27.540 --> 02:28.871
She might not be able
to cut around me

02:28.910 --> 02:30.400
but she can still type a text.

02:30.450 --> 02:31.849
So I'm guessing everything
she told the judge

02:31.880 --> 02:33.245
about Charlotte was a lie.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.269
Maybe she came
back here to mourn

02:34.320 --> 02:35.617
the death of her mentor

02:35.650 --> 02:36.878
not her tormentor.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.649
So we're-we're definitely saying

02:38.690 --> 02:39.759
that Sara's the stalker?

02:39.790 --> 02:42.327
I'm telling you guys
that bitch wasn't Stockholmed.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.282
(Spencer)
'Well, the only thing
we know for sure is that'

02:44.330 --> 02:46.525
she has spent two years
helping Charlotte torture us.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.653
That's plenty of time to perfect
the art of cyber stalking.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.918
Or it could just be some techie
at the phone company

02:50.970 --> 02:53.939
with too much time on his hands.

02:53.970 --> 02:55.938
[sighs]
God, I miss New York.

02:55.970 --> 02:57.801
I am addicted
to Blue Bottle Coffee.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.274
One cup and you feel like
you can handle anything

03:00.310 --> 03:01.675
your boss throws at you.

03:01.710 --> 03:03.575
Staplers, her phone--

03:03.610 --> 03:05.703
You boss literally
throws things at you?

03:08.820 --> 03:10.344
Wait. What are you doing?

03:10.390 --> 03:11.948
I lied to Lorenzo
yesterday and he knows it.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.412
I don't have any time
to play games.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.678
Like the techie's
really gonna respond.

03:20.460 --> 03:22.690
Okay, the techie's typing.

03:25.670 --> 03:26.989
[phone beeps]

03:27.040 --> 03:28.632
"Yes. ll

03:37.650 --> 03:40.346
* Got a secret can you keep it

03:40.380 --> 03:42.746
* Swear this one you'll save

03:42.790 --> 03:45.418
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:45.450 --> 03:47.782
* Taking this one
to your grave *

03:47.820 --> 03:50.425
* If I show you
then I know you *

03:50.460 --> 03:52.928
* Won't tell what I said

03:52.960 --> 03:55.394
* 'Cause two can keep a secret

03:55.430 --> 03:57.728
* If one of them is dead *

03:59.470 --> 04:01.734
So you're with Dr. Rollins?

04:02.970 --> 04:05.939
Ah, sounds peaceful there.

04:05.970 --> 04:09.007
Okay, well, give us a call
if you need anything.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.541
Bye.

04:10.580 --> 04:13.048
So Alison's
at the Rollins' family farm

04:13.080 --> 04:14.809
in Eastern Pennsylvania.

04:14.850 --> 04:16.738
They're on a dairy tour
right now.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.815
Okay, if Ali's really
tasting Amish cheese

04:18.850 --> 04:20.681
do you think
she could be the cyber stalker?

04:20.720 --> 04:23.757
If is a really big
two letter word, Hanna.

04:23.790 --> 04:26.395
Whoever this person is
they think that we know

04:26.430 --> 04:28.625
who killed Charlotte and
they're sending us these texts

04:28.660 --> 04:29.820
because they want us
to rat that person out.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.462
Okay, but we do know
who killed her.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.899
- Don't we?
- Ezra said he didn't do it.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.396
(Spencer)
'Maybe that's what
you heard, Aria'

04:34.440 --> 04:35.498
but the rest of us heard Ezra

04:35.540 --> 04:37.906
kick us out of his apartment.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.828
Guys.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.542
(man on TV)
And every member of this police
department is taking this case

04:42.580 --> 04:45.970
not just seriously
but personally.

04:46.010 --> 04:48.740
Without going into detail
that can harm the investigation

04:48.780 --> 04:50.816
'I can tell you
that we are narrowing down'

04:50.850 --> 04:52.579
'our list of suspects.‘

04:52.620 --> 04:54.781
We're confident we know
what the murder weapon was

04:54.820 --> 04:56.378
and we will find it.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.079
'The person who killed
Charlotte DiLaurentis'

04:58.130 --> 05:00.519
'will be brought to justice.‘

05:01.930 --> 05:03.727
Aria.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.438
Oh, what's my dad doing here?

05:08.470 --> 05:10.700
(Hanna)
'Looks like he got a room.'

05:10.740 --> 05:12.776
I didn't know
he was seeing anyone.

05:12.810 --> 05:14.937
Yeah, it's because
they're doing it at The Radley.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.379
[elevator dings]

05:17.980 --> 05:21.313
[cell phones ringing]

05:26.990 --> 05:28.457
(Hanna)
'It's a 9 iron.‘

05:28.490 --> 05:30.082
You could kill
somebody with that.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.826
Do we really think
that's a murder weapon?

05:32.860 --> 05:34.350
Does Ezra play golf?

05:35.800 --> 05:37.961
Hey, guys, enjoy!

05:38.000 --> 05:39.490
Sabrina, hey!

05:39.540 --> 05:40.859
Can I talk to you for a second?

05:40.900 --> 05:42.834
- It's Aria, right?
- Yes. Hey!

05:42.870 --> 05:45.703
Um, uh, look,
so I've been helping Ezra

05:45.740 --> 05:48.732
out with his new book
and I'm a little worried.

05:48.780 --> 05:50.577
He hasn't been answering
any of my calls.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.976
- Ezra's out of town.
- Are you sure?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.976
I saw him leave, so yeah!

05:55.020 --> 05:56.749
Do you know where he went?

05:56.790 --> 05:59.953
When he gets like this, I've
learned it's best not to ask.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.754
- Like this?
- There is dark and brooding.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.018
And then there's dark
and depressed.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.494
I would check that box for Ezra.

06:08.100 --> 06:11.820
Look, he disappears a lot.
He's usually back in a few days.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.529
Look, he-he didn't tell me
he was going out of town

06:15.570 --> 06:18.607
but I know that he finished
the next chapter of his book

06:18.640 --> 06:19.971
and I'm supposed
to proofread the pages

06:20.010 --> 06:21.477
before I e-mail them to my boss.

06:21.510 --> 06:24.809
So...could you just
let me into the loft?

06:26.650 --> 06:29.949
Please. Mate, my job
is on the line here.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.116
I hear you, Aria.

06:31.150 --> 06:33.015
But if I let you
into my boss' apartment

06:33.060 --> 06:35.449
my job's gonna be on the line.

06:35.490 --> 06:36.627
Sorry.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.564
[indistinct chatter]

06:52.480 --> 06:54.573
- Hey!
- Hey.

06:56.950 --> 07:00.113
Thanks for making
the coffee this morning.

07:00.150 --> 07:03.586
Yeah, I'm sorry, I had to run
to a breakfast meeting

07:03.620 --> 07:06.453
and then...all of this.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.051
You didn't sneak out
because of--

07:09.090 --> 07:11.627
No! God, no!

07:11.660 --> 07:14.857
Last night was perfect.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.027
Did you know that
89% of all young voters

07:17.070 --> 07:18.992
when recently surveyed said
that the recent economic slump

07:19.030 --> 07:21.464
has forced them
to put their life plans on hold?

07:21.500 --> 07:23.934
- Gil, what's up?
- This was updated this morning.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.528
It's everything
you'd wanna know about

07:25.570 --> 07:26.935
the Phillips' family
and then some.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.232
I will eat, live and
breathe this. Thank you, Gil.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.147
- Wow. That is a thick file.
- Yeah!

07:32.180 --> 07:34.011
Okay, Candidate Phillips.

07:34.050 --> 07:35.915
She gave the commencement speech
at Wesleyan

07:35.950 --> 07:38.646
before earning her JD
at Georgetown.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.650
Her favorite ice cream
IS actually sorbet

07:42.690 --> 07:44.555
and she often binges
on candy corn

07:44.590 --> 07:45.887
while on the campaign trail.

07:45.930 --> 07:47.522
Oh, candy corn?

07:47.560 --> 07:48.993
That's a serious
sugar addiction.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.463
Yeah!

07:52.030 --> 07:55.033
'And here is the recon
on her family.'

07:57.110 --> 07:59.032
I mean, we have to assume
that they know as much about us

07:59.070 --> 08:00.606
as we know about them.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.575
I know it's a little
awloNard considering.

08:03.610 --> 08:05.942
Yeah, you said
Yvonne was nice, right?

08:05.980 --> 08:08.119
Yeah, yeah, we've only
hung out a couple of times

08:08.150 --> 08:10.243
but...she seems okay.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.612
Cool, um, ifI didn't think
this town was small when I left

08:13.660 --> 08:15.753
it certainly is now.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.590
Hey, um, I was, uh,
thinking about

08:19.630 --> 08:23.566
taking a drive to see Toby.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.858
Um..

08:27.600 --> 08:29.704
Yeah, I'm cool with that.

08:35.310 --> 08:37.073
Um..

08:37.110 --> 08:39.749
...so since we, uh..

08:40.920 --> 08:43.639
I..
Should I get my own place?

08:45.590 --> 08:47.683
Is that what you want?

08:48.620 --> 08:50.759
Is that what you want?

08:53.630 --> 08:57.566
Look, I just need you
to promise me one thing.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.692
Okay.

08:58.730 --> 09:00.129
I will always get the first cup

09:00.170 --> 09:01.569
of coffee in the morning.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.204
[chuckles]

09:03.240 --> 09:04.730
Spencen.

09:04.770 --> 09:06.931
...I promise I will not
come between you

09:06.980 --> 09:09.073
and your relationship
with caffeine.

09:09.110 --> 09:10.748
Thank you.

09:10.780 --> 09:13.874
Wow! It's so short.
You look hot.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.569
- Where are you?
- 'I'm at the airport.‘

09:15.620 --> 09:18.612
- Babe, you're leaving early.
- Mm-hmm. Is that a problem?

09:18.650 --> 09:20.049
- Never.
- 'I'm gonna rent a car.'

09:20.090 --> 09:22.650
- You got any preference?
- Oh, you don't need one.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.885
Lucas is letting us use his Jag.
Comes with a loft.

09:24.930 --> 09:26.818
- You wanna pick me up then?
- In Philly?

09:26.860 --> 09:29.863
(Jordan)
'I'm taking the company plane.
We can land in Brookhaven.‘

09:29.900 --> 09:32.164
I'll see you on the runway.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.590
Company plane? That's fancy.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.301
And it's literally
a private jet.

09:37.340 --> 09:38.830
It's so nice.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.134
Flying private makes
the first class feel like coach.

09:41.180 --> 09:43.045
- It totally ruins you.
-Hmm.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.878
That's a high class
problem to have.

09:45.910 --> 09:50.279
Okay, so he's charming,
handsome and he adores you.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.015
I'm not seeing a downside.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.950
- Yeah, me neither.
- What?

09:53.990 --> 09:56.288
So how come you've been engaged
for almost a year

09:56.320 --> 09:57.878
but you haven't set
a wedding date?

09:57.930 --> 10:01.957
Well, I think
I'm finally ready to do that.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.061
I told Spencer it was okay
if she and Caleb got together.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.931
Wait, what? Back up.

10:07.970 --> 10:11.235
Yeah, she likes him like that.

10:11.270 --> 10:13.807
And does he like her like that?

10:13.840 --> 10:16.775
She's Spencer.
What's not to like?

10:16.810 --> 10:18.675
- You're really okay with that?
- You know what?

10:18.710 --> 10:21.838
Ever since I've been back here,
all I've done is spin and twirl.

10:21.880 --> 10:26.283
And with Jordan, I don't spin
and I don't twirl.

10:26.320 --> 10:30.689
He keeps me grounded and
I really like how that feels.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.897
So when's the wedding?

10:32.930 --> 10:34.898
Well, I've been honest with him

10:34.930 --> 10:36.659
about everything in my life,
but the other night

10:36.700 --> 10:38.019
I lied to him about

10:38.070 --> 10:40.664
sneaking out of the room
to erase that tape.

10:41.740 --> 10:43.162
Sorry that we asked
you to do that.

10:43.210 --> 10:46.031
I'm gonna tell my mom
what happened and then..

10:46.070 --> 10:49.278
...I'll tell Jordan and
if he still wants to marry me

10:49.310 --> 10:51.346
then I'm ready.

10:51.380 --> 10:53.644
[cell phone rings]

10:56.950 --> 10:58.645
It's Aria.

11:01.390 --> 11:02.880
Thanks.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.750
So you're really doing
this all by yourself?

11:04.790 --> 11:06.018
Yvonne's been helping.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.426
Please, I've banged
my thumb more times

11:08.460 --> 11:10.018
than I've hit the nails.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.197
- Hey, Caleb.
- Hey, how are you?

11:12.230 --> 11:14.039
- I'm with you, by the way.
- Really?

11:14.070 --> 11:15.389
Yeah, I mean,
I can jack a mainframe

11:15.440 --> 11:17.067
with a screwdriver,
but you give me power tools

11:17.110 --> 11:18.429
I am the dumbest guy
in the room.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.108
When my eyes see a power saw

11:20.140 --> 11:22.005
my mind sees a finger
with no hands.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.179
Yeah, and a chainsaw takes me
straight to no arms.

11:24.210 --> 11:25.802
- How about a wood chipper?
-Hmm.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.078
- :Fargo!"
- Fargo!"

11:27.120 --> 11:28.075
[laughing]

11:28.120 --> 11:29.917
And I see mulch.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.180
That's because you don't watch
TV or go to the movies with me.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.882
- That's not entirely true.
- Mm.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.286
- We stream.
- Yes.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.958
It's embarrassing,
but we've been binging

11:40.000 --> 11:40.989
on "The Tonight Show."

11:41.030 --> 11:42.292
Why is it embarrassing?

11:42.330 --> 11:44.161
Fallon is hilarious.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.895
[chuckles]

11:45.930 --> 11:48.239
- What?
- Yeah, you explain it.

11:48.270 --> 11:52.161
If I'm late for this prep
meeting, my mom's gonna kill me.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.178
I'll see you tomorrow
at the town hall.

11:54.210 --> 11:57.179
Yeah, I've heard you've joined
the Hastings' campaign.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.074
- Yep.
- What?

11:58.110 --> 12:00.442
You're-you're,
you're working for Veronica.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.072
I found out this morning.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.145
Yeah, she is kind of
a tough lady to say no to.

12:04.190 --> 12:07.079
Well, I look forward
to finally meeting Spencer.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.350
Bye! Bye!

12:12.830 --> 12:15.196
Wow, when I'm falling
for a girl, I, uh

12:15.230 --> 12:16.766
usually cook her a meal.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.268
You are building her a house.

12:20.970 --> 12:23.165
So how about you? You, uh..

12:23.210 --> 12:25.132
You cooking for anyone?

12:26.910 --> 12:29.401
Does that have to do with Hanna?

12:29.440 --> 12:31.772
You're still holding on to that?

12:33.480 --> 12:36.142
Uh, actually
I connected with someone

12:36.180 --> 12:39.115
a few years ago.

12:39.150 --> 12:41.152
The timing wasn't right
and it was just..

12:41.190 --> 12:44.159
It-it felt really complicated.

12:44.190 --> 12:47.159
It still is pretty complicated.

12:48.230 --> 12:49.549
That's why I'm here.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.965
For someone
who's a straight shooter

12:51.000 --> 12:53.093
you're really talking
in circles.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.035
It's Spencer.

13:01.340 --> 13:03.103
Oh!

13:03.150 --> 13:05.300
We-we've just been spending
a lot of time together

13:05.350 --> 13:08.217
as-as friends and..

13:08.250 --> 13:11.947
Look, if-if you're not okay
with this, just say the word.

13:13.990 --> 13:16.083
How does she feel about it?

13:17.030 --> 13:19.123
I think the same.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.958
Well, if it's what you both
want, then it's not complicated.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.263
Well, I guess
we'll see how it goes.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.601
You wanna put me to work?

13:39.650 --> 13:41.072
I mean, I-I suck at power tools

13:41.120 --> 13:42.439
but I can probably
pound a few nails.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.449
No, I gotta go. I'm meeting
Yvonne's parents for lunch.

13:45.490 --> 13:48.186
So I should probably go change.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.448
Okay, well, thanks for the beer.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.378
Okay.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.385
Anytime.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.332
I called his landline,
I called his cell phone

14:04.370 --> 14:06.133
I even called
his little brother.

14:06.170 --> 14:08.274
'It's not like Ezra to just
walk out on me like this.‘

14:08.310 --> 14:10.005
But Sabrina said
it kind of is like him now.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.244
Aria, where's your off switch?

14:11.280 --> 14:12.918
- You're gonna blow a circuit.
- No.

14:12.950 --> 14:15.271
This is just level two.
Do you wanna see level three?

14:15.320 --> 14:17.015
[sighs]
Man, I miss yoga class.

14:17.050 --> 14:18.085
I miss Liam. I miss Boston.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.315
I miss sanity, Emily.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.625
[exhales sharply]
Okay, ujjayi breath, Aria.
Just breathe.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.359
[exhales sharply]

14:27.930 --> 14:29.591
- Better now?
- No.

14:29.630 --> 14:32.394
I need you to keep Sabrina busy
while I get the key to Ezra's.

14:32.430 --> 14:35.035
Aria, I like her.
I don't wanna lie to Sabrina.

14:35.070 --> 14:37.630
Okay, fine, so just go,
go buy her a cup of coffee.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.661
You just said that you like her,
so it shouldn't be that hard

14:39.710 --> 14:42.008
to make a friendly conversation.
There's no lying in that.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.179
Okay, then we're deceiving her.

14:44.210 --> 14:46.349
Emily, I'm sorry. I really am.

14:46.380 --> 14:49.042
But I need to see if that 9 iron
is missmg from Ezra's clubs.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.480
Aria, I'm trying to get
my life together, okay?

14:51.520 --> 14:53.488
I wanna do the right thing,
not move two steps back.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.080
I understand that,
but if Ezra killed Charlotte..

14:56.120 --> 14:57.553
Breaking and entering,
it's a crime.

14:57.590 --> 14:59.182
We're not stealing anything.

14:59.230 --> 15:00.527
[sighs]
Okay, fine.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.199
But what do we do
if Ezra did kill Charlotte?

15:03.230 --> 15:06.097
Do we text a photo of him to
our new cyber bully Sara Harvey?

15:06.130 --> 15:09.497
No, but at least we'll know
what we're up against.

15:15.210 --> 15:17.144
[sighs]

15:28.560 --> 15:31.529
[instrumental music]

15:50.180 --> 15:52.045
[camera shutter clicks]

15:55.450 --> 15:58.385
[dramatic music]

16:16.770 --> 16:18.533
Hey, honey. I didn't know
you were coming.

16:18.570 --> 16:21.676
I was just headed out to
the hotel to meet with Spencer.

16:21.710 --> 16:23.371
This town hall
is turning out to be

16:23.410 --> 16:25.207
quite a nice
little event for us.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.445
I erased the security footage
from the hotel

16:27.480 --> 16:30.187
the night
Charlotte was murdered.

16:30.220 --> 16:31.539
[sighs]
Oh, Hanna.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.615
We had nothing to do
with what happened to her

16:33.660 --> 16:36.982
but...now it looks like
we could have.

16:42.630 --> 16:45.019
Okay, so you don't have a TV

16:45.070 --> 16:47.766
you don't have a cell phone
and you don't have a computer?

16:47.800 --> 16:49.290
Not even a Facebook account.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.467
Sorry, but Twitter
is the new Facebook

16:51.510 --> 16:53.137
and now Snapchat's
the new Twitter

16:53.180 --> 16:55.171
but Periscope might be
the new Snapchat.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.747
(Sabrina)
'This is why I stay unplugged.‘

16:57.780 --> 16:59.042
[chuckling]

16:59.080 --> 17:00.638
Um, so what prompted

17:00.680 --> 17:02.545
your social media blackout?

17:02.580 --> 17:05.481
When I got sick, I realized
that someday I will disappear.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.080
But while I'm still here,
I want people to see me

17:08.120 --> 17:11.521
the actual me,
not the me on some web page.

17:13.230 --> 17:16.222
So does that work?
Do people see the real you?

17:16.260 --> 17:18.262
Well, you're here
having coffee with me.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.133
You didn't text,
you didn't send an e-mail.

17:24.270 --> 17:26.261
Um..

17:26.310 --> 17:29.404
...Sabrina, I have
to tell you something.

17:32.850 --> 17:35.717
You make a perfect cappuccino.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.513
[chuckles]

17:37.550 --> 17:40.383
Do you wanna live dangerously
and have one more?

17:40.420 --> 17:43.127
I'll step out
on the ledge with you.

17:45.660 --> 17:48.390
Hanna, why couldn't you
have just left it alone?

17:48.430 --> 17:51.319
I screwed up. I know that.
But I did it for Aria.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.564
_ _ You're not
in high school anymore.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.092
- You don't owe them anything.
- But they're still my friends.

17:56.140 --> 17:59.439
And what's the big deal?
No evidence, no crime, right?

17:59.470 --> 18:01.631
The security company we use
backs up all of our tapes

18:01.680 --> 18:04.308
to a hard drive that they store
at some place called The Farm.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.102
If the police get ahold
of that drive

18:06.150 --> 18:07.640
they'll see
that Aria left the hotel

18:07.680 --> 18:09.671
and they'll know that you're
the one who erased the footage.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.688
Can we go to The Farm?
Can we get it before they do?

18:11.720 --> 18:14.154
No, Hanna. We can't.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.459
Ezra?

18:27.440 --> 18:30.136
[intense music]

18:37.180 --> 18:39.375
Five, six, seven..

18:41.420 --> 18:42.546
[sighs]

18:43.420 --> 18:44.739
- Hey, Gil.
- Hey.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.280
Look, uh, Ashley's running late

18:46.320 --> 18:48.379
but we can still walk
through the event.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.389
So you and Yvonne
are gonna be sitting here.

18:51.430 --> 18:52.658
We're expecting a decent turnout

18:52.690 --> 18:54.920
'so we're gonna get
some extra chairs.‘

18:54.960 --> 18:56.496
The event's gonna have
an informal feel.

18:56.530 --> 18:58.919
Hopefully sparking,
uh, audience participation.

18:58.970 --> 19:01.939
Possibly a lively impromptu
debate between you and Yvonne.

19:01.970 --> 19:05.303
- I'm sorry. A debate?
- Only if it comes naturally.

19:05.340 --> 19:06.739
Now you might get a question
on Lafeyette

19:06.770 --> 19:08.499
it's okay.
Answer naturally.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.179
Just do not pretend to know
something that you don't know.

19:11.210 --> 19:15.317
That's how you wind up
a viral video. Okay?

19:15.350 --> 19:17.648
[cell phone beeps]

19:17.690 --> 19:19.908
- Spencer?
- Yeah. It's great.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.781
Great. Excuse me.

19:21.820 --> 19:25.927
Uh, no, no, no. No, no.
Chair goes over there.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.497
[cell phone beeps]

19:34.700 --> 19:37.635
[intense music]

19:50.650 --> 19:51.912
[beeps]

19:51.950 --> 19:53.281
(woman on speaker)
'Ezra, hi.'

19:53.320 --> 19:54.651
'It's Stephanie from Habitat.‘

19:54.690 --> 19:57.727
'I'm back in the States.
Let's grab a coffee.‘

19:57.760 --> 19:59.853
[beeps]

19:59.890 --> 20:00.857
(Byron on speaker)
'Ezra.‘

20:00.900 --> 20:02.322
Dad?

20:02.360 --> 20:04.567
'I have to talk
to you about..'

20:04.600 --> 20:07.694
'Well, about what you think
you saw that night.‘

20:11.610 --> 20:13.578
* Let's do this together
let's do this together **

20:13.610 --> 20:15.601
This was amazing, but I'm,
I'm usually not terrified

20:15.640 --> 20:17.278
but these planes
were so much smaller--

20:17.310 --> 20:19.904
Em, Em, can I borrow you?

20:19.950 --> 20:22.418
Yeah, I'm just in the middle
of a conversation right--

20:22.450 --> 20:24.418
It's urgent.

20:24.450 --> 20:25.610
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:25.650 --> 20:28.858
Just need to talk to my friend,
that's all.

20:28.890 --> 20:31.950
Uh, so rain check on the rest
of your Haiti adventure?

20:31.990 --> 20:34.390
Yeah, sorry about all this.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.894
I used to mellow out
with weed. Just sayin'.

20:38.930 --> 20:40.466
Thanks.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.809
Okay, so what'd you find?

20:44.840 --> 20:48.401
Em...I-I think my dad
might have had something

20:48.440 --> 20:50.544
to do with Charlotte's murder.

20:52.850 --> 20:55.546
I'm sorry, Jordan.

20:55.580 --> 20:58.413
More about lying to you
than erasing that tape.

20:59.820 --> 21:02.812
I totally get it
if you don't wanna marry me.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.299
You actually think
I'd let something like this

21:07.330 --> 21:08.888
come between us?

21:08.930 --> 21:11.467
Yes, you screwed up, but..

21:11.500 --> 21:12.967
...you're protecting a friend

21:13.000 --> 21:16.993
and that is one of the many
things I love about you.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.702
You're the most loyal person
I've ever met.

21:19.740 --> 21:22.300
That's why I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

21:23.110 --> 21:24.577
Blow.

21:28.650 --> 21:30.413
And do you seriously want a wife

21:30.450 --> 21:32.645
that you might have to visit
behind six inches of glass?

21:32.690 --> 21:34.908
[chuckling]
You're not Hannibal, Hanna.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.452
People screw up,
that's why lawyers have jobs.

21:38.490 --> 21:39.889
We can get ahead of this

21:39.930 --> 21:41.522
but you're gonna have to be
honest about everything

21:41.560 --> 21:44.028
from now on, okay?

21:44.070 --> 21:46.823
Okay. I'm gonna call my dad.

21:46.870 --> 21:50.067
I'm sure_he has _
some connections in Philly.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.534
Do you really have
to tell pappie?

21:52.570 --> 21:55.778
Hanna, my family loves you.
It's gonna be okay.

21:57.410 --> 21:59.401
[cell phone vibrates]

22:05.120 --> 22:06.940
(Jordan)
'Hey, dad, it's me.'

22:06.990 --> 22:10.448
Yeah, good. Um, uh,
I've got a quick favor to ask.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.779
I got another text too.

22:12.830 --> 22:14.525
(Hanna)
'What'd yours say?'

22:14.560 --> 22:15.822
Why are you whispering?

22:15.860 --> 22:17.623
Because Jordan's here.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.819
(Spencer)
'Well, did you
tell him about it?‘

22:18.870 --> 22:21.395
Because I really
wanna tell Caleb.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.534
Because he's Caleb or...
because you guys are--

22:24.570 --> 22:25.832
You know what, Hanna.

22:25.870 --> 22:27.838
Look, if you're really
not okay with this--

22:27.880 --> 22:29.905
Wow, that was fast.

22:29.940 --> 22:31.999
It's never gonna
happen again, okay?

22:32.050 --> 22:33.517
I swear it.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.614
You know what, that was
just a knee-jerk reaction.

22:37.650 --> 22:40.039
It's fine, Spencer, really.

22:40.090 --> 22:41.557
I told Jordan I erased the tape

22:41.590 --> 22:43.729
but I'm afraid to tell him
about that text.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.081
I mean, this person
threatened to blow us up.

22:46.130 --> 22:48.690
My-my brain is telling me
to be honest, but..

22:48.730 --> 22:51.426
...my PTSD is telling me
to shut the hell up.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.994
Let me get Caleb on this.

22:53.030 --> 22:54.463
Maybe he can shut this down

22:54.500 --> 22:56.161
and then you can tell
Jordan everything.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.464
Okay. Do it, Spencer.

23:03.210 --> 23:06.509
[intense music]

23:16.990 --> 23:18.651
-Hey.
-Hmm"

23:19.830 --> 23:22.424
There's something
that you need to see.

23:34.940 --> 23:35.975
Caleb's making progress.

23:36.010 --> 23:37.477
He says
that the signal's bouncing

23:37.510 --> 23:38.704
through several proxy servers

23:38.750 --> 23:40.513
but he's been able
to spoof the IP address

23:40.550 --> 23:42.575
and backtrace it _
to an encrypted connection.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.884
- What does that mean?
- 'I'm not entirely sure.‘

23:44.920 --> 23:46.114
But he does think
that he's zeroing in

23:46.150 --> 23:47.651
on the location of the source.

23:47.690 --> 23:49.487
Okay, let's say
it's coming from The Radley.

23:49.520 --> 23:50.589
Can he narrow it down
to the room?

23:50.630 --> 23:52.052
He doesn't really have to.

23:52.090 --> 23:53.796
I mean, if we're right about
Sara, she's the only person

23:53.830 --> 23:55.627
who's staying at The Radley
who spent two years

23:55.660 --> 23:58.868
in Charlotte's School
For Stalkers.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.960
Um, can you just call me back
after you talk to Aria's dad?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.900
Yeah.

24:03.940 --> 24:06.602
[whispers]
Hi. Congratulations
on the engagement.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.575
Oh, my gosh,
it's so good to see you..

24:09.610 --> 24:13.569
- Spencer, hi. I'm Yvonne.
- Hi. Hi.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.576
Oh, sorry,
we're a family of huggers

24:15.620 --> 24:17.713
and Toby's told me
so much about you.

24:17.750 --> 24:19.615
Yeah, you're an impressive
woman yourself.

24:19.650 --> 24:22.517
Top of your class,
double major at Smith. Wow.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.585
So they gave you
a packet on me too?

24:24.630 --> 24:26.882
Yeah. Sorry, I had to read that.

24:26.930 --> 24:27.954
Well, me too.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.719
DC must be missing
its brightest young lobbyist.

24:30.770 --> 24:33.068
You know as well as I do
that a campaign is won or lost

24:33.100 --> 24:35.239
in the last three weeks, so..

24:35.270 --> 24:36.737
...I'm not gonna get
another vacation day

24:36.770 --> 24:38.704
for the next three years
of my life, but I thought

24:38.740 --> 24:41.004
it was important for me
to be here for my mom.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.645
Yeah, I've heard
you're not a fan of Rosewood.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.817
I, uh, I told Yvonne that

24:47.850 --> 24:50.068
I was Green Acres
and you were Park Avenue.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.111
[laughs]

24:52.150 --> 24:53.708
Green Acres?

24:53.760 --> 24:57.014
He's just kidding.
We watch a lot of retro TV.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.548
Oh, God, I'm getting
a ticket. Sorry.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.919
Oh, yeah, fine.

25:06.270 --> 25:08.135
So you saw the ring earlier?

25:08.170 --> 25:09.728
Yeah, I mean,
I-I wasn't trying to be

25:09.770 --> 25:11.704
a crazy ex-girlfriend stalker.

25:11.740 --> 25:13.674
- I just, I was there.
- It's a small town.

25:13.710 --> 25:16.270
We're gonna run into each other.

25:16.310 --> 25:18.107
So you didn't propose?

25:18.150 --> 25:21.574
Officer Toby, can you
help me out with this?

25:25.920 --> 25:28.912
- Nice meeting you, Spencer.
- Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

25:34.230 --> 25:37.529
[intense music]

25:46.240 --> 25:48.037
He's not here.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.901
But his car's parked
right outside.

25:55.780 --> 25:58.783
- 'Hello.'
- Dad.

25:58.820 --> 26:01.118
- I need to talk to you.
- 'It's not a good time, Aria.'

26:01.160 --> 26:02.889
- 'I'm in a meeting.‘
- This can't wait.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.888
(Byron on phone)
'I'm sorry,
I-I really have to go.‘

26:04.930 --> 26:06.989
'I'll call you later.
I love you.'

26:09.260 --> 26:11.569
He hung up on me.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.661
I think she knows.

26:18.340 --> 26:20.604
Something's really wrong.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.131
Where are you going with this?

26:23.180 --> 26:26.001
- 'You went to see her?'
- 'Yes, Byron. I did.'

26:26.050 --> 26:28.268
Why on earth
would you go see her?

26:28.320 --> 26:29.947
I.. Enough, okay? Please.

26:29.980 --> 26:32.915
She kidnapped
and tortured our daughter.

26:32.950 --> 26:36.010
I went to visit her today
to hear Charlotte's story.

26:36.060 --> 26:37.755
(Byron)
'After I asked you not to go.'

26:37.790 --> 26:40.088
She did terrible things,
Byron. Terrible.

26:40.130 --> 26:43.190
And I wanted to know why.
I needed to know why.

26:43.230 --> 26:44.891
Okay. Why did she do it?

26:44.930 --> 26:48.388
They put her in that horrible
place when she was just a child.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.761
And they never came back
to get her.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.266
I mean, can you even imagine?

26:52.310 --> 26:55.700
I don't want to imagine, okay?
I don't need to know why.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.879
I just need to know that
she's gonna stay locked away

26:57.910 --> 27:01.038
and never hurt Aria again.

27:01.080 --> 27:04.208
Charlotte's doctors say
she's improving.

27:04.250 --> 27:08.084
That she's rebalancing
after all the years of neglect.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.886
Wait. Are you saying
that they may let her out?

27:11.930 --> 27:13.420
That's a decision for the court.

27:13.460 --> 27:16.020
Well, I'm not interested
in the court.

27:16.060 --> 27:18.665
Charlotte DiLaurentis will walk
the streets of Rosewood

27:18.700 --> 27:20.793
over my dead body.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.730
- I'm calling him back.
- Wait.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.670
Where does your dad
keep his golf clubs?

27:27.710 --> 27:30.031
In his car.

27:30.080 --> 27:33.777
Wait, I-I used to keep
an extra set of keys somewhere..

27:34.450 --> 27:36.714
Em?

27:36.750 --> 27:38.809
I forgot to put this back.

27:40.150 --> 27:42.254
The good news is
you didn't kill Charlotte.

27:42.290 --> 27:44.451
But you faked an alibi
and you tampered with evidence

27:44.490 --> 27:45.923
in a murder investigation.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.758
Those are serious offenses.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.153
I'm screwed, aren't I?

27:50.200 --> 27:52.168
Only if they can prove
you did it.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.361
But I did do it.

27:54.400 --> 27:57.460
I'm the only person
you're gonna tell that to.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.764
I'm very good at my job,
Hanna, but I can't protect you

27:59.810 --> 28:01.129
unless you tell me
everything you know.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.876
There can't be any surprises
when they're questioning us.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.484
Hanna, that's it, right?

28:11.520 --> 28:13.442
You've told us everything?

28:13.490 --> 28:15.788
Yeah. You know
everything I know.

28:16.860 --> 28:17.986
(Spencer)
'Hey.'

28:22.400 --> 28:24.766
You and Yvonne going camping?

28:24.800 --> 28:27.166
She's got a lot
on her plate right now.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.065
Like you.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.967
Oh, so you're pulling a Toby.

28:32.010 --> 28:35.332
Spence, we're not an us anymore.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.905
You don't get to weigh in
on my life.

28:37.950 --> 28:41.477
I just thought that we found
a way to be friends.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.045
Honestly..

28:44.090 --> 28:45.887
...it was a lot easier
being your friend

28:45.920 --> 28:47.342
when you lived in DC.

28:47.390 --> 28:50.279
Toby, you know that I can't go
anywhere right now, okay?

28:50.320 --> 28:52.982
The cops are asking us
a hundred questions and..

28:53.030 --> 28:55.897
...I am really helping
my mom with this campaign.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.993
I get it, Spence.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.295
[chuckles]

29:03.340 --> 29:06.537
Why is it so easy
to fall back into old habits?

29:06.570 --> 29:09.437
They're hard to give up.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.869
That's what makes them habits.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.910
I'm sorry, Toby.

29:15.950 --> 29:19.181
Don't apologize.
Nobody did anything wrong.

29:21.390 --> 29:24.848
Well, are you at least gonna
stay for tomorrow's event?

29:25.830 --> 29:27.957
l
. Im sure
Yvonne s counting on you.

29:30.830 --> 29:32.320
I'll be there.

29:42.380 --> 29:44.905
Make a right up
at this next intersection.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.100
Why was it so easy
to track down that signal?

29:47.150 --> 29:50.540
And also why build a firewall
if it's so easy to break down?

29:50.580 --> 29:51.979
I was just hoping
you were gonna tell me

29:52.020 --> 29:53.419
all these texts
were coming from The Radley.

29:53.450 --> 29:55.384
Hmm, so we could break
into Sara's room

29:55.420 --> 29:57.456
and kick her ass together?

29:57.490 --> 29:58.582
You know what they say.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.421
That was an attempt
at a non-sarcastic joke.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.358
Didn't, didn't really make it.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.828
Hey, um, I actually,
I wanted to ask you something.

30:15.610 --> 30:17.168
Already?

30:18.950 --> 30:21.817
Why did you delete
that text about Toby?

30:24.550 --> 30:27.018
You saw it?

30:27.050 --> 30:30.383
Spencer, I'm a professional.
It's kind of what I do.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.457
I don't know, I just..

30:35.500 --> 30:39.960
This was new and I_didn't
want it to get complicated.

30:42.140 --> 30:45.462
I just wanted things
to stay new and easy.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.374
Okay.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.975
I get that.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.624
[indistinct chatter]

31:13.600 --> 31:15.238
(Sabrina)
Hey, Emily.

31:15.270 --> 31:16.965
I didn't wanna think
that's what happened..

31:17.000 --> 31:18.900
No, no, no. I, uh..

31:18.940 --> 31:20.100
We were just trying
to help Ezra.

31:20.140 --> 31:21.129
You and his ex-girlfriend Aria?

31:21.180 --> 31:22.499
It's not what it looks like.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.076
There's gonna be a lock
on that box tomorrow.

31:24.110 --> 31:25.145
You don't have to do that.
We won't--

31:25.180 --> 31:26.374
And I actually thought you cared

31:26.410 --> 31:27.547
about what I had to say.

31:27.580 --> 31:28.547
I did. I dO--

31:28.580 --> 31:29.615
Life is short, Emily.

31:29.650 --> 31:30.617
Save your lies for someone

31:30.650 --> 31:32.948
who has time to hear them.

31:35.990 --> 31:38.083
Sabrina, you don't have
to do that.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.557
Remember to use_
as few words as p055ible

31:41.600 --> 31:42.658
when answering his questions.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.622
Yes, no and I don't recall.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.194
That's all
that needs to be said.

31:46.230 --> 31:47.959
[sighs]
He's gonna know I'm lying.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.093
It doesn't matter
if he can't prove it.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.341
(Jordan)
It's okay,
you're not in this alone.

32:11.260 --> 32:14.718
Hanna, you're free to go.
At least for now.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.318
Wait. Why? What happened?

32:16.360 --> 32:19.420
The security company lost
The Radley backup drive.

32:19.470 --> 32:20.619
They lost it?

32:20.670 --> 32:23.298
You didn't do that, did you?

32:23.340 --> 32:24.500
No.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.298
Let's get out of here.

32:35.350 --> 32:38.285
[dramatic music]

33:01.810 --> 33:03.402
No lock.

33:26.100 --> 33:29.194
[dramatic music]

33:37.640 --> 33:39.574
[cell phone vibrates]

33:49.660 --> 33:53.050
It's happening again...isn't it?

34:02.870 --> 34:06.169
Four, five, six,
seven, eight, ni..

34:11.210 --> 34:13.576
[intense music]

34:41.580 --> 34:44.549
[instrumental music]

35:11.410 --> 35:13.207
All my friends turn out
for national elections

35:13.240 --> 35:14.468
but most of us don't even know

35:14.510 --> 35:16.273
when our local elections
are held.

35:16.310 --> 35:19.609
Or really who
our local representatives are.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.619
Until my mom got involved
in the campaign, I didn't.

35:22.650 --> 35:25.448
Is young voter turnout low
because we don't care to ask?

35:25.490 --> 35:28.516
Or is it because we're_ confused
and we're skeptical?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.255
A lot of politicians
came to power

35:30.290 --> 35:31.621
on the backs of rich donors.

35:31.660 --> 35:33.651
They like it when
you're confused and cynical.

35:33.690 --> 35:34.691
Yvonne's right.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.392
For them, the less you know,
the less you care.

35:37.430 --> 35:40.422
So they get to make a lot
of the big decisions for you.

35:40.470 --> 35:42.233
But we _do have_access
to information

35:42.270 --> 35:43.669
and we wanna help you find it.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.531
We're on opposite sides
of this campaign

35:45.570 --> 35:47.561
'but on this issue,
we stand together.‘

35:47.610 --> 35:49.703
If you don't vote,
you don't have a voice.

35:51.380 --> 35:53.746
Are you okay with opening
this up to questions?

35:53.780 --> 35:56.248
Absolutely, Spencer.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.248
If you guys have any questions
we'd be really happy

35:58.290 --> 35:59.609
'to answer them.‘

36:01.590 --> 36:03.478
Hanna, your mom
just got into the elevator.

36:03.520 --> 36:05.226
'(Hanna)
It's a go?'

36:10.730 --> 36:13.722
(Aria on phone)
'We need to find out if
Ezra's hiding out with my dad.‘

36:15.800 --> 36:17.961
She's logged out.
I don't know her password.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.706
(Aria)
'Not really my department.‘

36:19.740 --> 36:22.937
Hanna can't figure out
her mom's password.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.847
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:25.880 --> 36:29.418
Um, okay, what was the name
of your first pet?

36:30.750 --> 36:32.388
Guppy.

36:32.420 --> 36:34.251
You named a guppy Guppy?

36:34.290 --> 36:36.258
I was two.

36:36.290 --> 36:38.429
Uh, try your birthday.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.350
- I'm in.
- 'Okay.'

36:42.400 --> 36:44.561
(Caleb)
'I'll call you
if she comes back down.'

36:44.600 --> 36:46.989
- Hey, Caleb.
- 'Yeah?‘

36:47.030 --> 36:50.397
I'm really glad about Spencer.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.659
I mean, that she told you
about the texts.

36:53.710 --> 36:55.302
Yeah, me too.

36:56.710 --> 36:58.439
[cell phone beeps]

37:02.820 --> 37:04.981
Whoever it is,
they were expecting us.

37:05.020 --> 37:07.409
They meaning Sara?

37:07.450 --> 37:09.554
You saw her
that night at Radley.

37:09.590 --> 37:12.718
Sara wasn't just wearing that
red coat, she was rocking it.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.296
The more I think about it,
the more I think

37:14.330 --> 37:16.389
that everything she told
that judge was a lie.

37:16.430 --> 37:18.398
Sara wasn't forced to play
the game. She wanted to.

37:18.430 --> 37:20.489
Maybe you're right,
but there's someone else

37:20.530 --> 37:22.691
who's seeking justice
for Charlotte.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.334
Are you absolutely sure
that Alison's out of town?

37:25.370 --> 37:27.838
I'm not absolutely sure
about anything anymore.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.703
Aria, guys don't always
have full sets of golf clubs.

37:30.740 --> 37:32.549
Maybe your dad
never had a 9 iron.

37:32.580 --> 37:35.515
And that just happens to be
the club this Not A has?

37:35.550 --> 37:37.711
I was trying to be
a calming influence, Emily.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.012
I'm sorry.

37:39.050 --> 37:41.484
Hey. Neither your dad
or Ezra are staying here.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.953
Wait, what about Sara?

37:42.990 --> 37:45.550
She put a Do Not Disturb sign
on her door two days ago

37:45.590 --> 37:47.023
and she instructed
the staff to not go

37:47.060 --> 37:48.288
in her room when she's gone.

37:48.330 --> 37:49.558
What is she doing in there?

37:49.600 --> 37:52.728
I'll take building a lair
for 300 Alex.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.989
(Yvonne)
Be inspired to create the future
you imagine by voting.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.531
What it really comes down
to you guys is this.

37:58.570 --> 37:59.730
'Nothing's ever gonna change'

37:59.770 --> 38:01.806
unless you make
your voice heard.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.673
Thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.644
[applause]

38:15.920 --> 38:17.478
That was fun.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.681
That really was fun.

38:19.730 --> 38:21.823
- Oh, excuse me one second.
- Yeah.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.837
I like her.

38:30.870 --> 38:32.508
She's one of a kind.

38:32.540 --> 38:36.431
I'll stay out of your way,
okay? I promise.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.402
You were right yesterday.

38:38.450 --> 38:41.715
Leaving would have been
a mistake.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.787
Look, I know it's hard
for all of us being back here.

38:44.820 --> 38:46.412
We've to force ourselves
to remember that

38:46.450 --> 38:48.554
we're not the people
that we once we were.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.985
But-but it's temporary, right?

38:53.030 --> 38:56.898
I mean, you are eventually
going back to DC.

38:56.930 --> 39:00.764
Yeah, they want me back
the second the election's over.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.848
How did I do?

39:12.880 --> 39:14.711
Guys?

39:14.750 --> 39:16.047
(Hanna)
'We were so busy looking
at the murder weapon'

39:16.080 --> 39:17.115
that we didn't notice--

39:17.150 --> 39:18.583
The carpet.

39:18.620 --> 39:19.644
(Hanna)
'You know, my mom spent weeks'

39:19.690 --> 39:20.816
trying to match the uniforms

39:20.850 --> 39:21.487
to those colors.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.885
So the person who sent this

39:22.920 --> 39:23.909
is staying at The Radley.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.053
Just like Sara Harvey.

39:26.090 --> 39:27.079
It's my dad.

39:27.130 --> 39:28.552
- Answer it.
- Answer it.

39:30.530 --> 39:32.464
- Dad?
- 'Hey, Aria.‘

39:32.500 --> 39:34.695
(Byron on phone)
'I know that you're with
your friends right now'

39:34.740 --> 39:36.833
'but I need to see you alone.‘

39:36.870 --> 39:39.430
'There's something
I need to tell you.'

39:42.740 --> 39:45.709
[dramatic music]

40:21.880 --> 40:24.849
