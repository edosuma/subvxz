WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.071
- HEY.

00:03.104 --> 00:04.805
ACCORDING TO THIS,
WE CAN AFFORD A CAR PHONE.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.475
- NO, NO CAR PHONE.
- WHY?

00:07.508 --> 00:09.577
WHY DO YOU FIGHT TECHNOLOGY?

00:09.610 --> 00:11.612
- OH, I'M AGAINST TECHNOLOGY?
- YEAH.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.782
- YEAH. WHO INTRODUCED YOU
TO THE WONDER BRA?

00:21.755 --> 00:23.524
- WELL, A MAN THAT RADICAL

00:23.557 --> 00:27.161
SHOULD WELCOME
A SIMPLE CAR PHONE.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.362
- WHY? SO YOU CAN JUST
TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS

00:28.396 --> 00:30.064
WHEREVER YOU GO?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.499
LOOK,
JUST SWEAT IT OUT

00:31.532 --> 00:33.167
'CAUSE SOON THE PHONE'S
GOING TO BE A LITTLE CHIP

00:33.201 --> 00:35.069
AND YOU CAN JUST HAVE IT
IMPLANTED IN YOUR HEAD.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.337
- WELL, GOOD.
I CAN'T WAIT.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.605
- YEAH, YOU'D LOVE THAT.

00:37.638 --> 00:41.242
I GOT A CALL COMING, YEAH.
HI, LINDA.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.477
HOW ARE YOU?
YEAH.

00:43.511 --> 00:46.714
OH, MY OTHER LINE,
I GOT TO PUT YOU ON HOLD.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.250
JULIE!
HI, JULIE, YEAH.

00:49.283 --> 00:52.286
OH, LINDA'S RIGHT HERE.
NO, I'LL PUT YOU ON CONFERENCE,

00:52.320 --> 00:56.657
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
YEAH, HOW ARE YOU GUYS, HUH?

00:56.690 --> 01:01.061
WHOA, HOLD ON, GUYS,
I'M GETTING A FAX.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.168
HI, I'M RAY,

01:07.201 --> 01:08.436
AND I LIVE HERE
IN LONG ISLAND

01:08.469 --> 01:10.104
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.405
SHE'S GREAT
WITH THE KIDS,

01:11.439 --> 01:13.507
THE HOUSE,
EVERYTHING.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.443
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE DOES IT.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.145
WE'VE GOT
A DAUGHTER, ALLY,

01:17.178 --> 01:20.548
AND TWIN
TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.783
IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THE KIDS.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.786
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.355
THAT'S RIGHT,

01:27.388 --> 01:30.524
AND MY BROTHER
LIVES WITH THEM.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.692
NOW, NOT EVERY FAMILY

01:31.725 --> 01:33.694
WOULD GO BY
ON A CONVEYER BELT FOR YOU,

01:33.727 --> 01:35.296
BUT MINE WOULD,
BECAUSE--

01:35.329 --> 01:37.665
- EVERYBODY
LOVES RAYMOND.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.267
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.310
ALL THREE KIDS ASLEEP.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.578
HUH?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.880
YOU THOUGHT I COULDN'T
GET ALLY TO TAKE A NAP.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.482
- AW, GOOD JOB, HONEY.
- YEAH.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.418
BY THE WAY,
TOMORROW WE HAVE TO BUY A PONY.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.424
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT
THIS GREAT BIG STAIN HERE?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.159
THAT CARPET GUY
SWORE UP AND DOWN

02:05.193 --> 02:06.594
THAT HE COULD
GET IT OUT.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.629
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT STAINS, ALL RIGHT?

02:08.662 --> 02:11.332
THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP;
THE HOUSE IS QUIET.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.434
NOW IT'S QUALITY TIME.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.170
JUST ME AND YOU.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.578
- YOU BETTER BE LOOKING
AT JEWELRY ADS.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.182
- OH!

02:28.216 --> 02:30.518
YOUR FATHER
HAS FINALLY DONE IT.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.852
- WHAT'S THAT,
BUCKLE HIS PANTS?

02:33.487 --> 02:34.955
- I WISH.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.624
THAT MAN HAS BEEN SITTING
IN FRONT OF THE TV

02:36.657 --> 02:38.626
EVERY DAY FOR 45 YEARS.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.860
"GET ME THIS;
GET ME THAT.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.531
YOU'RE CLIPPING THEM
TOO SHORT."

02:43.564 --> 02:47.235
THAT INGRATE CAN'T STOP
HOUNDING ME FOR FIVE MINUTES!

02:47.268 --> 02:49.970
OOH.
THAT'S INTERESTING.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.240
- YEAH, UH,
WE'VE SEEN THE STAIN.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.642
- OH, YOU KNOW, DEBRA,
WITH SOMETHING LIKE A SPILL,

02:54.675 --> 02:57.278
I FIND IT BEST TO WIPE IT UP
THE DAY IT HAPPENS.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.714
- MARIE--

03:00.748 --> 03:01.815
WHERE'S MY SANDWICH?

03:01.849 --> 03:03.251
- WHERE?

03:03.284 --> 03:05.886
EXACTLY WHERE YOU THREW IT--
IN THE GARBAGE.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.989
- WHERE IT BELONGED,
BECAUSE IT WAS NO GOOD!

03:09.022 --> 03:11.292
I SAID I WANTED
A TUNA SALAD SANDWICH!

03:11.325 --> 03:12.793
- AND LIKE A JERK,
I MADE IT FOR YOU!

03:12.826 --> 03:13.794
- HEY, THE KIDS--

03:13.827 --> 03:14.795
- NO!
NO, YOU DIDN'T!

03:14.828 --> 03:15.963
THAT WAS NOT TUNA SALAD.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.232
IT HAD NO CELERY IN IT!

03:18.266 --> 03:19.867
- OH, SO ONCE
I FORGOT THE CELERY.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.869
SO WHAT?
- SO WHAT?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.637
SO IT'S NOT TUNA SALAD!

03:23.671 --> 03:25.739
IT HAD NO BITE!
IT HAD NO CRUNCH!

03:25.773 --> 03:26.874
- OH, POOR YOU.

03:26.907 --> 03:27.875
- YEAH, POOR ME.

03:27.908 --> 03:28.942
RAYMOND, WHAT IS IT

03:28.976 --> 03:31.211
THAT MAKES TUNA SALAD
TUNA SALAD?

03:34.348 --> 03:35.416
COME ON!

03:35.449 --> 03:36.417
- IT'S THE CELERY,
THE CELERY.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.851
- UH-HUH.
UH-HUH!

03:37.885 --> 03:41.322
IT'S THE CELERY THAT MAKES
TUNA SALAD TUNA SALAD!

03:41.355 --> 03:43.724
WHAT YOU GAVE ME
WAS TUNA SLOP!

03:46.294 --> 03:47.295
- I PUT IN MAYO.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.329
I PUT IN DILL.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.497
I PUT IN PEPPER.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.832
I MASHED IT, I MIXED IT,
I SPREAD IT,

03:51.865 --> 03:54.835
AND YOU HAVE THE NERVE
TO SAY "SLOP" TO ME?

03:54.868 --> 03:55.836
- YES.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.037
SLOP TO YOU.
- OH!

03:57.070 --> 03:59.940
- SLOP TO YOU!
- OH.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.045
- HE WAS ON THE DEBATE TEAM.
- OH.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.514
[babies crying]

04:06.547 --> 04:08.782
NOW THE KIDS ARE--
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

04:08.816 --> 04:09.750
- I'D LIKE TO GET THEM.
- NO, NO, NO!

04:09.783 --> 04:11.785
- CAN I GET THEM?

04:11.819 --> 04:13.387
- THIS IS A NUTHOUSE.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.755
I'LL COME BACK
WHEN IT'S CALMER.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.024
LET'S GO, MARIE.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.059
- I'M NOT COMING.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.961
- BUT I'M STILL HUNGRY.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.663
- WELL, I'M STILL NOT COMING.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.898
CHOP YOUR OWN DAMN CELERY.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.569
- FINE!

04:28.602 --> 04:29.703
WHO NEEDS YOU?

04:29.737 --> 04:31.038
I'LL DO IT MYSELF!

04:32.940 --> 04:35.476
WHERE ARE THE KNIVES?

04:35.509 --> 04:36.810
- [laughs]

04:36.844 --> 04:39.046
- NEVER MIND!
I'LL USE MY RAZOR.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.487
- OH, THANK GOD
THEY'RE GONE.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.455
HMM.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.822
- THEY?

04:48.856 --> 04:51.759
- THEY. THE TWINS.
GONE BACK TO SLEEP.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.927
- GONE DOWN.
- AND YEAH.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.396
- DID YOU WANT ME TO GO?

04:55.429 --> 04:56.964
- NO, NO,
OF COURSE NOT, MARIE.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.967
- GOOD, BECAUSE I'M NOT
GOING BACK TO THAT HOUSE.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.702
- RIGHT.
UNTIL YOU COOL OFF.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.736
- NO, I'VE HAD IT.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.905
I'M STAYING HERE.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.841
- RIGHT.
TILL DINNER TIME.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.110
- I DON'T WANT DINNER.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.746
MAYBE I'LL BE HUNGRY
IN THE MORNING.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.050
- SHE DOESN'T EAT MUCH.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.494
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'S DOING UP THERE?

05:26.527 --> 05:28.829
- YOU HEAR THAT?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.464
- NO.
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.901
- THAT'S THE SOUND OF
ALL OUR CLOTHES BEING REFOLDED.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.805
- BOY, SHE DOESN'T STOP.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.608
HOW DID YOU SURVIVE
GROWING UP WITH HER?

05:40.641 --> 05:43.977
- I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.849
- I THINK SHE'S COMING.

05:54.722 --> 05:58.526
- YOU KNOW, DEAR,
YOUR CLOTHES ARE A DISASTER.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.495
YOU KNOW, THOSE WIRE HANGERS
CREASE EVERYTHING.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.464
OH.
SORRY.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.367
- OH, LOOK, HE'S UP.

06:08.602 --> 06:09.803
- OH.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.104
- MM. HI. HI.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.105
- WHERE'S YOUR IRON?

06:12.139 --> 06:13.574
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.042
MARIE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
IRON OUR CLOTHES.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.810
- WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW

06:16.844 --> 06:19.012
WHEN RELATIVES
ARE GOING TO COME BARGING IN.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.515
- AH, THAT'S TRUE.

06:21.549 --> 06:22.950
- LIKE MAYBE THERE'S
A BIG OCCASION,

06:22.983 --> 06:25.118
AND THE HOUSE IS FILLED
WITH RELATIVES.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.887
- LIKE WHAT?
WHAT OCCASION, MA?

06:26.920 --> 06:29.022
- I DON'T KNOW.
BIRTH. GRADUATION.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.624
CHRISTMAS. DEATH.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.461
- ALL MY FAVORITES.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.662
- I'M SERIOUS.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.197
I MEAN, GOD FORBID
IF SOMEONE SHOULD DIE,

06:37.230 --> 06:38.666
I MEAN, WHAT--

06:38.699 --> 06:40.501
IF YOU WERE TO DIE, DEBRA,

06:40.534 --> 06:43.170
EVERYONE WOULD BE HERE.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.539
AND IMAGINE THEM
UP IN THAT MESSY CLOSET

06:45.573 --> 06:48.108
TRYING TO PICK OUT
SOMETHING FOR YOU TO WEAR.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.211
- MA--

06:51.244 --> 06:52.780
- AND THEN AFTERWARDS,
THEY'LL WANT TO TAKE CLOTHES,

06:52.813 --> 06:54.181
SO YOUR DRAWERS
SHOULD BE VERY NEAT

06:54.214 --> 06:56.650
SO THEY CAN LOOK THROUGH
AND SEE WHAT THEY LIKE.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.453
- SO HOW WILL SHE DIE?

06:59.487 --> 07:01.789
- OH.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.791
NO, THE THING IS,
YOU WANT TO BE REMEMBERED

07:03.824 --> 07:07.495
AS A BEAUTIFUL,
CLEAN PERSON.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.500
- ANYTHING SHE COOKS FOR ME,
YOU'RE TASTING FIRST, OKAY?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.535
- DON'T WORRY.
SHE'LL BE GONE SOON, ALL RIGHT?

07:14.568 --> 07:16.870
MY FATHER CAN'T LAST ALONE
MUCH LONGER.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.071
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
GO IN THERE

07:18.105 --> 07:20.207
AND GIVE HER
A LITTLE NUDGE?

07:20.240 --> 07:22.442
- IS IT REALLY OUR BUSINESS?

07:24.077 --> 07:27.781
- RAY, SHE'S IN THERE
CHISELING MY HEADSTONE.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.517
- I JUST CAN'T
TELL HER TO LEAVE.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.251
SHE--YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'LL DO?
SHE'LL GIVE ME THE LOOK.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.786
- "THE LOOK."
- YEAH.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.488
- WELL, IT'S EITHER THAT

07:34.522 --> 07:36.957
OR WALK ACROSS THE STREET
AND SEE YOUR DAD.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.593
- I'LL TRY MOM.

07:43.864 --> 07:44.832
- ISN'T THIS FUNNY?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.567
I CAN'T FIND ONE
WITHOUT SPOTS.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.502
[chuckles]

07:48.536 --> 07:50.037
- LOOK, MA,
I GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.572
- YES, DEAR?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.011
- I'M GOING FOR A WALK.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.723
- DAD, CAN I COME IN?

08:09.757 --> 08:11.191
- YOU MAY ENTER!

08:13.627 --> 08:15.863
- LISTEN, DAD--

08:15.896 --> 08:16.897
WHAT, IS YOUR TV BROKEN?

08:16.930 --> 08:18.231
- OF COURSE NOT.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.299
LOOK. SEE?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.201
I TAPED DOWN THE SCAN BUTTON.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.971
NOW WHEN I'M FLIPPING CHANNELS,
I DON'T HAVE TO MOVE.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.274
- THAT'S GOOD.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.709
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TAPE
YOUR EYELIDS OPEN,

08:28.742 --> 08:31.111
AND THEN YOU'LL NEVER MISS
ANYTHING.

08:31.144 --> 08:34.114
- THAT'S SILLY.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.883
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, DAD.
WE GOT TO TALK.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.551
- ALL RIGHT. SIT DOWN.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.252
FIRST I WANT YOU
TO TRY SOMETHING.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.155
I WAS SOMEPLACE TODAY
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN 30 YEARS.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.957
GUESS WHERE I WENT.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.793
- THE BARBER.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.127
- UH--

08:52.332 --> 08:53.934
CLOSE.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.068
I WENT TO THE SUPERMARKET!

08:55.102 --> 08:56.069
- OH.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.204
- YEAH, I WANT YOU TO TASTE

08:57.237 --> 08:58.972
THIS GREAT NEW THING
THEY HAVE NOW.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.609
IT'S CALLED SALSA.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.010
- I'VE HAD SALSA, DAD.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.645
- NO KIDDING?
- YEAH, YEAH.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.947
- I BET YOU NEVER
PUT IT ON A CHIP.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.049
- YEAH, EVEN ON A CHIP.
I KNOW, IT'S GOOD.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.150
- GOOD?

09:10.183 --> 09:12.152
IT'S GENIUS.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.154
AND THE WOMAN IN THE SUPERMARKET
WAS GIVING IT AWAY,

09:14.187 --> 09:15.756
NO CHARGE.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.058
- THAT'S CALLED A SAMPLE, DAD.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.093
- I MUST'VE HAD 50 OF THEM.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.929
NO, THIS WOMAN,
SHE WAS GREAT.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.230
SHE HAD ON A BIG SOMBRERO.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.633
SHE'S SITTING
ON A PLASTIC BURRO.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.868
HEY, I'LL TAKE YOU
TO SEE HER.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.137
- [laughs]

09:30.170 --> 09:33.240
OH, YIPPEE.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.075
LISTEN, DAD, ABOUT MOM.
YOU CAN'T JUST--

09:35.108 --> 09:36.143
- FORGET MOM.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.845
LOOK AT ME.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.913
THIS IS THE REAL ME!

09:39.947 --> 09:41.682
I CAN DO WHAT I WANT--

09:41.715 --> 09:43.183
WHEN I WANT--

09:43.216 --> 09:45.118
AND HOW I WANT IT!

09:45.152 --> 09:47.020
I'M A FREE MAN!

09:49.022 --> 09:52.025
CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE?

09:52.059 --> 09:54.261
- IT'S BETTER IF I DON'T.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.362
- LOOK, LIKE TONIGHT.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.164
NO MORE WOMEN'S ENTERTAINMENT.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.265
NO "EMMA."

09:58.298 --> 09:59.933
NO "SENSE AND SENSIBILITY."

09:59.967 --> 10:01.669
NO "HOWARD'S END."

10:01.702 --> 10:03.303
NO, LOOK.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.039
I'VE GOT THE COMPLETE WORKS
OF ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER--

10:06.073 --> 10:09.109
EXCEPT THE ONE
WHERE HE GETS PREGNANT.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.410
- DAD, COME ON,
LISTEN TO ME.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.745
- WHAT? WHAT?

10:11.779 --> 10:13.380
- YOU CAN'T JUST STAY--
YOU--

10:16.183 --> 10:18.251
OH, GOD, WHAT CAN I SAY?
LOOK AT YOU.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.987
- [laughs]

10:20.020 --> 10:22.255
- YEAH, YOU'RE HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.256
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.192
GOOD FOR YOU, DAD.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.994
- YOU WANT TO JOIN ME LATER?

10:27.027 --> 10:28.829
- OH, I MIGHT HAVE TO.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.331
- IT'S THE PERFECT EVENING:

10:31.364 --> 10:34.234
"TERMINATOR 2" AND SALSA.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.070
[Imitating Schwarzenegger]
"YOU'LL BE BACK."

10:44.044 --> 10:45.913
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
WITHOUT FRANK?

10:45.946 --> 10:47.815
WHERE'S FRANK?

10:47.848 --> 10:49.783
- RIGHT NOW HE'S PROBABLY TAPING
THE TOILET HANDLE DOWN

10:49.817 --> 10:51.819
SO HE NEVER HAS TO FLUSH.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.694
- ISN'T HE COMING
TO GET HER?

11:00.728 --> 11:02.362
- I WAS THINKING THAT MY MOTHER
SHOULD PROBABLY SPEND

11:02.395 --> 11:04.031
A LITTLE MORE TIME HERE.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.066
- OH, WHAT HAPPENED?

11:06.099 --> 11:07.234
DIDN'T YOU TALK TO HIM?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.368
- I TRIED!

11:08.401 --> 11:09.837
I TRIED, BUT I--

11:09.870 --> 11:11.905
I THINK I PUSHED
A LITTLE TOO HARD,

11:11.939 --> 11:14.207
'CAUSE I LET HIM HAVE IT,
AND THEN HE THREW ME OUT.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.344
- YOU'RE LYING.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.281
- ALL RIGHT,
HOW DO YOU ALWAYS KNOW?

11:22.449 --> 11:23.817
NO.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

11:23.851 --> 11:26.253
WHAT, DOES MY NOSE
GET LONGER?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.822
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.459
- LOOK, I-I COULDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.861
HE'S HAPPY.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.428
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THIS.

11:35.462 --> 11:39.299
IT'S LIKE HE'S BEEN PAROLED
FROM THE MARRIAGE PRISON.

11:39.332 --> 11:43.837
THE ONE SOME GUYS
THINK THEY'RE IN.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.338
- WELL, LOOK, IF YOU CAN'T
TELL YOUR FATHER,

11:45.372 --> 11:46.473
THEN I'M TELLING YOUR MOTHER

11:46.506 --> 11:47.908
SHE'S GOT TO GO HOME
RIGHT NOW,

11:47.941 --> 11:49.476
'CAUSE I CAN'T
TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.979
- THE LOOK.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.113
- UH, MARIE--

11:53.146 --> 11:54.447
- YEAH.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.183
- MARIE, CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.885
- ANYTHING, DEAR.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.724
- I'M GOING FOR A WALK.

12:06.927 --> 12:07.895
- YEAH, NOT SO EASY.

12:07.928 --> 12:08.962
- DON'T!

12:10.130 --> 12:11.899
- YOU THOUGHT YOU--
- NO, NO, NO.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.234
DON'T!

12:18.005 --> 12:19.206
- RAY?

12:31.451 --> 12:35.188
- DEBRA, YOU'VE BEEN GONE
A HALF HOUR.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.090
I'M ALL ALONE HERE.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.261
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OVER THERE?

12:41.294 --> 12:42.996
- I'LL BE HOME LATER, RAY.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.297
I'M GOING TO STAY
FOR DINNER.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.398
YEAH.
[laughs]

12:45.432 --> 12:46.800
- MORE SALSA?

12:46.834 --> 12:49.069
- OOH.
GRACIAS, SENOR.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.005
YES, WE ARE ACTUALLY
HAVING A NICE TIME.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.307
AND I COULD USE A BREAK
FROM YOUR MOTHER TOO.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.508
- [laughs]

12:55.542 --> 12:57.410
BYE-BYE!

12:58.979 --> 13:00.013
ARE YOU READY
FOR THE SURPRISE?

13:00.047 --> 13:02.149
- MMM.
I'M STARVED.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.316
- OKAY.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.055
HERE IT IS.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.892
OLE.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.426
- OOH.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.995
A DINNER OF EGGS.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.229
- AHH--

13:16.263 --> 13:17.564
BUT NOT JUST ANY EGGS.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.532
EGGS WITH SALSA ON THEM.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.935
THEY'RE CALLED
HUEVOS RANCHEROS.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.136
- OH-HO.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.538
- THIS DISH IS GOING TO
SWEEP THE NATION.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.240
YES, SIR.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.843
FILL YOUR FACE,
I MADE MUCHO.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.444
- MMM.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.046
THANK YOU.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.348
THAT'S REALLY SWEET OF YOU,
FRANK.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.384
- [mouth full]
HMM. I CAN BE SWEET.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.452
IT TAKES PEOPLE TIME
TO DISCOVER THAT.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.921
OH, I'M SORRY.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.189
DID I SPRAY YOU
A LITTLE?

13:42.222 --> 13:43.423
- THAT'S OKAY.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.461
- HI, MOM.
HI, DAD.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.829
- HI, ROBERT.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.469
- WHERE'S MOM?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.138
- MOM WHO?

14:00.573 --> 14:03.010
- WHAT'S DEBRA DOING HERE?

14:03.043 --> 14:04.011
- WELL, YOUR MOM
WENT TO BE WITH RAY,

14:04.044 --> 14:07.514
AND I CAME OVER
TO BE WITH FRANK FOR A WHILE.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.082
- WHERE DO I GO?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.921
- WHEREVER YOU WANT.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.956
LIVE YOUR LIFE!

14:29.636 --> 14:31.238
- THAT'S MOM'S CHAIR.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.510
- MOM, ALL THREE KIDS ASLEEP?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.179
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.480
- WHAT, IS IT HARD?

14:40.513 --> 14:41.982
I CUDDLED THEM.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.051
I READ A STORY.
I SANG.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.253
YOU FORGET I'M A MOTHER?

14:46.286 --> 14:48.956
- HOW COULD I?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.557
LISTEN, MA,
ABOUT DAD--

14:50.590 --> 14:53.426
- NO, I'M NOT TALKING TO HIM
UNTIL HE APOLOGIZES.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.662
- YEAH, BUT DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST--

14:55.695 --> 14:57.998
HEY, WHAT'S THE STEAK FOR?

14:58.031 --> 15:00.533
- MY SON.
[laughs]

15:00.567 --> 15:02.669
- AND YOU LEFT THE FAT ON?

15:02.702 --> 15:05.605
DEBRA--DEBRA ALWAYS CUTS
THE FAT OFF.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.640
- ON STEAK PIZZAIOLA?

15:07.674 --> 15:09.409
WHAT, DO I LOOK INSANE?

15:09.442 --> 15:10.944
- STEAK PIZZAIOLA?

15:10.978 --> 15:14.114
REAL STEAK PIZZAIOLA
WITH THE CHEESE ON THE TOP?

15:14.147 --> 15:16.449
- OF COURSE.
A THICK LAYER.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.717
WHY?
DEBRA DOESN'T USE CHEESE?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.652
- NOPE. NO.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.689
SHE COOKS FOR HEALTH.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.158
- WHAT COULD BE HEALTHIER
FOR YOU THAN THE FOOD YOU LOVE?

15:25.192 --> 15:26.159
HUH?

15:26.193 --> 15:27.427
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.728
- LOOK HERE.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.097
I MADE A PECAN PIE.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.500
- OH...

15:33.533 --> 15:35.268
OH, MAN.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.007
- GO AHEAD;
GO TAKE A NAP.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.441
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN IT'S READY.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.611
OOH, YOU WANT SOME MILK
TO TIDE YOU OVER?

15:44.644 --> 15:46.713
- OKAY.
- OKAY, SIT DOWN.

15:46.746 --> 15:51.718
OKAY, I GOT, UM,
SKIM AND WHOLE IN HERE.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.487
- I'LL TAKE WHOLE.

15:54.521 --> 15:58.025
- OH--YOU WANT
SOME CHOCOLATE IN IT?

15:58.058 --> 16:00.027
- OKAY.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.430
- OKAY.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.498
I'LL HAVE SOME TOO.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.699
[door opens]

16:06.733 --> 16:07.700
- I FOUND YOU.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.436
- OH, ROBBIE, SIT DOWN.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.039
WE'RE HAVING CHOCOLATE MILK.
YOU WANT SOME?

16:12.072 --> 16:13.473
- OKAY.

16:19.546 --> 16:23.083
- OH, I LOVE TAKING
GOOD CARE OF MY BOYS.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.087
- I LIKE A LOT OF CHOCOLATE.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.488
- OKAY.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.195
- BRILLIANT, HUH?

16:35.228 --> 16:37.630
- WHEN DOES IT STOP?

16:37.664 --> 16:40.433
- WHEN IT GETS
TO SOMETHING GOOD.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.735
- DO WE HAVE TO FLIP
THE CHANNELS SO MUCH?

16:42.769 --> 16:45.572
I'M GETTING A MIGRAINE.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.174
- YOU GET USED TO IT.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.109
LOOK AT ME.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.485
- IT'S OFF NOW, FRANK.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.819
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.523
UH, I COULD USE ANOTHER SHOT
OF ICE CREAM.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.526
MARIE USUALLY WARMS UP
THE FUDGE A LITTLE.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.296
- THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK MARIE TO DO IT.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.431
- SHE'S NOT HERE.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.767
- AH, AND WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IS?

17:14.801 --> 17:16.403
- WELL, SHE'S, UH--

17:16.436 --> 17:17.404
- WHAT, FRANK?

17:17.437 --> 17:18.405
- SHE'S--
SHE'S--

17:18.438 --> 17:19.406
- WHAT?

17:19.439 --> 17:20.640
- A WOMAN.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.475
- AH.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.576
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

17:23.610 --> 17:27.847
COULD--COULD I TELL YOU
A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT WOMEN?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.416
- OH, BROTHER.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.386
- SEE, UM--

17:33.420 --> 17:35.255
A WOMAN WANTS
TO BE NURTURING, HMM?

17:35.288 --> 17:36.556
SHE WANTS TO BE GIVING,

17:36.589 --> 17:38.825
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IF THERE'S NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT,

17:38.858 --> 17:41.361
NO RECIPROCATION,

17:41.394 --> 17:43.463
WELL, IT CAN LEAD
TO HURT FEELINGS

17:43.496 --> 17:45.632
AND EVEN RESENTMENT.

17:45.665 --> 17:46.833
- OKAY.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.368
DON'T WARM THE FUDGE.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.671
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING
TO MAKE THIS SIMPLE.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.406
I'M LEAVING NOW.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.841
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE
ON YOUR OWN.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.609
AND JUST REMEMBER, FRANK,

17:56.643 --> 17:58.778
THE SUPERMARKET CAN BE
A VERY LONELY PLACE.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.880
THERE ISN'T ALWAYS GOING TO BE
SOME LADY ON A PLASTIC DONKEY

18:00.913 --> 18:03.783
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.886
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE
HOW MUCH YOU NEED MARIE.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.722
- BECAUSE I DON'T.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.358
- DON'T YOU SEE?

18:11.391 --> 18:12.792
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT
THE PERFECT MARRIAGE.

18:12.825 --> 18:13.893
YOU NEED FUDGE,

18:13.926 --> 18:15.895
AND SHE NEEDS
TO WARM IT UP FOR YOU.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.297
- WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE,

18:17.330 --> 18:19.666
WHY DOESN'T SHE
JUST COME BACK OVER HERE?

18:19.699 --> 18:22.635
- MAYBE SHE'S TIRED, FRANK.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.137
I MEAN, I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
FOR THREE HOURS,

18:24.171 --> 18:26.339
AND I NEED A NAP.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.441
- I GOT THE COUCH.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.578
- LOOK, FRANK,
I AM BEGGING YOU.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.481
JUST--JUST GO OVER
AND APOLOGIZE TO HER.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.683
SHE JUST WANTS
TO BE APPRECIATED.

18:36.716 --> 18:40.520
NO WOMAN WANTS TO BE
THE MOMMY ALL THE TIME.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.522
- WHO WANTS MORE CEREAL?

18:47.327 --> 18:48.461
OOH.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.832
- HEY--A PRIZE.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.901
LUCKY ME.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.772
- WHY LUCKY YOU?

18:59.806 --> 19:02.475
WHO SAID IT'S YOURS?

19:02.509 --> 19:05.378
- IT WAS IN MY BOWL.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.547
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT'S MY BOWL,

19:07.580 --> 19:09.316
'CAUSE IT'S MY HOUSE.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.152
SO LUCKY ME.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.189
- HEY, COME ON.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.591
- YOU GOT IT THE LAST TIME.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.427
- THAT WAS 30 YEARS AGO.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.596
- RELAX, ALL RIGHT?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.365
I MAY NOT EVEN WANT IT.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.600
YOU CAN HAVE IT
IF I DON'T WANT IT.

19:29.436 --> 19:33.740
A SUBMARINE POWERED
BY BAKING SODA.

19:33.773 --> 19:34.807
WANT IT.

19:38.878 --> 19:39.912
- NO WAY.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.414
- I DON'T THINK
I EVER GOT THAT ONE.

19:41.448 --> 19:44.451
- YOU GOT EVERYTHING.
- DID NOT.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.618
- GIVE IT.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.587
- GET OUT OF HERE.
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.721
- CAN TOO.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.490
- COME ON,
I TAUGHT YOU BOYS TO SHARE.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.225
I TOLD YOU--OH!

19:52.259 --> 19:53.960
I TAUGHT YOU TO SHARE!

19:57.864 --> 20:00.333
- AH!

20:00.367 --> 20:03.470
- NO, ROBBIE.
OH, NO, NO, NO.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.572
- AH!

20:05.605 --> 20:07.474
- OH, BE CAREFUL
OF YOUR EYES!

20:09.942 --> 20:11.010
OH, MY GOODNESS.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.479
- OH, YOU'RE HOME.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.816
- JUST DO WHAT I DO, ROBERT.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.851
TELL HIM YOU'RE TIRED,
AND HE'LL CLIMB OFF.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.461
- ARE YOU HAPPY?

20:28.495 --> 20:30.730
SMASHED.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.932
- WHY CAN'T YOU BOYS
PLAY NICE?

20:32.965 --> 20:34.334
- HE STARTED IT.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.335
- DID NOT.
- DID TOO.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.504
- DID NOT!
- DID TOO!

20:39.406 --> 20:41.508
LISTEN, MA--
- DID NOT!

20:43.310 --> 20:44.844
- YOU HAVE TO GO HOME NOW.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.946
- ME? WHY?
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

20:46.979 --> 20:49.549
- WELL, LOOK AT ME.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.451
I'M--I'M A GROWN MAN, MA,
OKAY?

20:51.484 --> 20:53.653
I HAVE KIDS OF MY OWN.

20:53.686 --> 20:54.921
LOOK, IF YOU WANT
TO BABY SOMEBODY,

20:54.954 --> 20:56.523
GO BABY DAD.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.291
- HE NEEDS YOU, MARIE.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.293
- HE NEEDS ME?

21:00.327 --> 21:01.828
NOT UNTIL HE CRAWLS OVER HERE

21:01.861 --> 21:03.763
AND APOLOGIZES
ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES

21:03.796 --> 21:06.466
AM I GOING BACK
TO THAT TUNA HELL!

21:08.935 --> 21:10.537
- DON'T YOU SEE, MA?

21:10.570 --> 21:12.505
IT'S WHERE YOU BELONG.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.509
- HI.

21:16.543 --> 21:19.712
MARIE, I'M GOING
TO THE STORE.

21:19.746 --> 21:22.081
YOU WANT TO WALK ALONG?

21:22.114 --> 21:24.684
- OH, YOU APOLOGIZED!

21:26.586 --> 21:27.887
- I'M NOT APOLOGIZING.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.423
I JUST RAN OUT OF SALSA.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.791
- SALSA?

21:31.824 --> 21:33.693
WHEN DID WE EVER USE SALSA?

21:33.726 --> 21:36.396
- A LOT'S CHANGED
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.339
- SO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED, RAY?

21:46.373 --> 21:48.608
- I WOULD,
BUT I'M A LITTLE DIZZY.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.976
SO HOW DID YOU GET MY FATHER
TO COME OVER?

21:50.009 --> 21:51.744
- OH, I JUST EXPLAINED TO HIM
WHAT WOMEN NEED,

21:51.778 --> 21:53.480
AND HE UNDERSTOOD.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.848
- NO. REALLY.
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.650
YOU KNOW, FOR WHATEVER REASON
THAT RELATIONSHIP WORKS,

21:57.684 --> 21:59.786
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
EXAMINE IT TOO CLOSELY.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.054
- YEAH, IF ONLY
THAT WAS POSSIBLE.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.990
- YEAH.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.859
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU AND ROBERT,
WRESTLING LIKE THAT.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.027
WHAT GOT INTO YOU TWO?

22:08.060 --> 22:09.529
- I DON'T KNOW.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.897
IT WAS STUPID.
I KNOW IT WAS STUPID.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.865
- ACTUALLY, IT SEEMED
KIND OF FUN.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.501
AH!

22:17.003 --> 22:17.970
- OH--

22:18.004 --> 22:19.806
TOO SLOW.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.884
- THERE SHE IS.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.722
LUCKY ME.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.559
- WHY LUCKY YOU?

22:42.862 --> 22:44.564
- HEY, COME ON.
