00:01.958 --> 00:04.874
[up-tempo jazz playing]

00:04.961 --> 00:07.877
[indistinct conversations]

00:11.098 --> 00:12.360
Let's do it.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.014
[clinking]

00:15.972 --> 00:18.583
- Thank you, Sadie.
- Mm-hmm.

00:18.670 --> 00:23.023
My friends, I am so proud
and happy to welcome you

00:23.110 --> 00:25.460
to this celebration
of my son Xander

00:25.547 --> 00:28.767
the new C.E.O.
of Harrington Media.

00:28.854 --> 00:32.119
[male #1]
'Here, here.'

00:32.206 --> 00:35.078
Where is
the little cuss, anyway?

00:35.165 --> 00:37.994
Late for work already,
not a good sign.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.517
Elizabeth, text him,
would you?

00:39.604 --> 00:40.779
You got it.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.129
Um, I am sure my husband

00:42.216 --> 00:44.435
'has a very good excuse
for his..'

00:44.522 --> 00:46.394
'Ah, there you are, Xander.'

00:48.309 --> 00:49.701
[male #2]
'Bravo Xander.'

00:51.834 --> 00:53.966
[crowd applauding]

01:00.103 --> 01:01.539
[crowd gasping]

01:01.626 --> 01:03.063
[murmuring]

01:10.983 --> 01:12.594
[Cho]
That's what killed
Xander Harrington,

01:12.681 --> 01:13.986
'and this is where he was
attacked.'

01:14.074 --> 01:15.640
'Now, the blood trail
starts here'

01:15.727 --> 01:17.381
'right where the letter opener
was found.'

01:17.468 --> 01:19.470
The deputy coroner says it was
a single stab wound to the neck.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.994
Now the blow sends him
backwards.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.127
He slams his head,
goes down.

01:24.214 --> 01:27.435
He's dazed, slowly bleeding out
for a good 20 minutes or so,

01:27.522 --> 01:30.133
then somehow gathers himself up
and goes for help.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.222
Coroner couldn't believe he even
made it out to the party.

01:32.309 --> 01:35.312
Party which was for him.
Guy just got a big promotion.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.009
Had a wife and kid.
How sad is that?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.533
Sad. Anything else?

01:38.620 --> 01:40.274
Well, according to the victim's
father, there was

01:40.361 --> 01:42.537
a confidential business file on
this desk that's gone missing.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.843
- Nothing else taken.
- What was the file about?

01:44.930 --> 01:48.151
Plans for the "Daily Observer,"
the newspaper.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.501
'Debt restructuring,
cost cutting, layoffs.'

01:50.588 --> 01:52.155
Layoffs?

01:52.242 --> 01:53.939
Any "Observer" employees
invited to the party?

01:55.941 --> 01:58.379
So you're all reporters
for the, uh, "Observer."

01:58.466 --> 01:59.815
'That's right.'

01:59.902 --> 02:01.904
Xander Harrington--
man of the people, huh?

02:01.991 --> 02:04.602
Inviting
the ink-stained wretches.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.256
Xander was a good guy.

02:06.343 --> 02:07.736
Did any of you hear
about the layoffs

02:07.823 --> 02:08.997
that were coming up soon?

02:09.085 --> 02:10.826
Layoffs?
What layoffs?

02:10.913 --> 02:13.829
Well, actually, there's,
uh, quite a long list.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.875
'Yeah. It appears that
no one is safe.'

02:16.962 --> 02:19.356
'Must be very scary in the
newspaper business these days.'

02:19.443 --> 02:21.402
That's a very lovely dress.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.099
'Great color.'

02:23.186 --> 02:24.622
Well, thank you.
[chuckles]

02:24.709 --> 02:26.015
I'm Heather Evans.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.843
Hello, Heather Evans.
You're very attractive.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.497
It's probably why
your name's not on that list.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.326
Good-looking women live
in a different world.

02:32.413 --> 02:34.458
Excuse me? What's this list
you keep mentioning?

02:34.545 --> 02:36.504
Oh, come on, Heather. The list
that was in the file

02:36.591 --> 02:38.897
that you took
off Xander Harrington's desk.

02:38.984 --> 02:40.682
Everyone here..
We mention layoffs,

02:40.769 --> 02:42.336
and everyone
here reacts except you

02:42.423 --> 02:44.512
'because you have read
the list.'

02:44.599 --> 02:46.122
Oh, that's ridiculous.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.124
I didn't go anywhere near
Xander's desk.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.082
Bravo. Very well played,

02:50.170 --> 02:52.128
considering the stress
you must be feeling right now.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.999
You know, I was hoping
to dazzle you all

02:54.086 --> 02:57.960
with my uncanny detective
skills, but you force me..

02:58.047 --> 03:00.136
...you force me to just reveal
the humdrum facts

03:00.223 --> 03:02.356
and point out that you have
blood on your shoes, Heather.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.014
[Lisbon]
'Could you step out
of your shoe, ma'am?'

03:09.101 --> 03:11.103
"Stop the presses"?
That's the phrase, right?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.584
"Stop the presses."
Yeah. Got it.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.587
Always wanted to say that.

03:19.111 --> 03:22.027
[theme music]

03:31.167 --> 03:33.430
Xander Harrington caught you
snooping in his office

03:33.517 --> 03:35.302
and you killed him.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.347
Now maybe
you didn't mean to do it.

03:37.434 --> 03:38.914
You were surprised, scared--

03:39.001 --> 03:41.525
No. I didn't even see him.

03:41.612 --> 03:45.225
It was dark. No lights.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.183
Curtains were drawn.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.925
I went to the desk

03:50.012 --> 03:51.579
I took the file..

03:51.666 --> 03:52.971
...and I ran.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.932
If I'd known he was..

03:58.673 --> 04:01.458
My God,
I would never have..

04:01.545 --> 04:03.504
How'd you know
that there was a list at all?

04:06.507 --> 04:09.118
Someone told you. Who?

04:09.205 --> 04:10.641
A confidential source.

04:10.728 --> 04:13.035
And you'll go to jail
to protect this source?

04:17.213 --> 04:20.911
Ed. Edward Harrington.
Xander's brother.

04:20.999 --> 04:23.263
He, um..

04:23.350 --> 04:26.135
He said there were gonna be
layoffs on Monday.

04:26.222 --> 04:27.702
'I just,
I just wanted to know

04:27.789 --> 04:29.660
'whether or not
I still had a job.'

04:32.228 --> 04:36.276
- It's a very good job.
- Not anymore, it's not.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.278
[Cho]
'Tell me exactly what
happened from the beginning.'

04:38.365 --> 04:40.323
Ma'am? Is there, uh..

04:40.410 --> 04:42.630
I-Is there something specific
that you wanted?

04:42.717 --> 04:46.677
No. No.
Just keeping apprised.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.331
Huh.

04:48.418 --> 04:49.941
Alex Harrington
is the owner

04:50.028 --> 04:52.248
of the seventh largest
media conglomerate in the world.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.858
Yes, ma'am.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.512
And you don't want
to disappoint a man

04:55.599 --> 04:57.384
who owns 200 TV stations
and a national newspaper.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.516
No, ma'am.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.301
Looks like Heather's cleared.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.433
Timeline puts her at the bar
at the time of the attack.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.783
That's according to several male
guests who remember her well.

05:05.870 --> 05:09.961
Figures. Only leaves 196 party
guests and 42 staff

05:10.048 --> 05:12.877
as potential suspects.
Start with the brother.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.575
Okay.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.664
Take Rigsby.

05:18.535 --> 05:19.971
Problem?

05:20.058 --> 05:22.234
Nope. Not at all.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.976
Ma'am? You're giving
my team assignments?

05:25.063 --> 05:28.328
I know. I'm sorry.
Should've been your call.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.808
I just want to make sure
those two can hack it.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.332
Fair enough.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.515
[Lisbon]
'The head of your
security said'

05:41.602 --> 05:43.995
'that the house is fully wired,
but the family asked'

05:44.082 --> 05:46.433
the cameras inside be
turned off? Why's that?

05:46.520 --> 05:48.696
I take responsibility
for that.

05:48.783 --> 05:52.613
No, it's my fault. I'm Tara--
Alex's wife. This is Ella.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.094
And I'm the one who had
the cameras disconnected.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.400
It's my fault.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.315
It's nobody's fault,
dear. Hush.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.012
Why'd you do it?

06:01.099 --> 06:03.928
Cameras and panic rooms
and armed guards--

06:04.015 --> 06:06.017
'it's a lot to take.'

06:06.104 --> 06:09.107
I hated feeling watched
in my own home.

06:09.194 --> 06:11.240
'Seems so silly now.'

06:11.327 --> 06:15.200
I'm sorry. How long until you
take that horrible stuff down?

06:15.287 --> 06:16.854
Forensics has promised
to release the crime scene

06:16.941 --> 06:19.161
as soon as possible. I am
so sorry for any inconvenience.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.423
[Ella whimpers]

06:20.510 --> 06:21.555
Excuse me.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.210
Uh, I'm too upset.

06:25.297 --> 06:28.083
Uh, m-m-may I?

06:28.170 --> 06:30.259
Thank you.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.174
[laughs]

06:32.261 --> 06:34.306
[Lisbon]
'You and Xander were close?'

06:34.394 --> 06:37.048
He and Sadie were
my only true friends.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.963
People seem more interested

06:39.050 --> 06:41.966
in befriending
your money and connections

06:42.053 --> 06:45.317
when you're married to
the C.E.O. Of Harrington media.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.017
[Alex]
Yes, I suppose
it can be difficult at times.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.889
By the way,
it'sformerC.E.O.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.196
- Xander forced me out.
- 'Really?'

06:54.283 --> 06:55.980
[Alex]
'Really.'

06:56.067 --> 07:00.289
'He convened the board,
secured the necessary votes.'

07:00.376 --> 07:02.247
Son staged a coup.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.988
Yes.

07:04.075 --> 07:07.078
You have any idea the guts
it takes to pull that off?

07:07.165 --> 07:11.953
Xander proved he could lead.
I've never been prouder of him.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.869
Proud of, uh, Eddie, too,
my other son.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.697
[Patrick]
'Well, of course.'

07:16.784 --> 07:20.440
But Xander had
the strength to lead, the guts.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.746
That's important to you,
isn't it? Guts?

07:22.833 --> 07:27.229
Of course. Guts, heart.
What else is there?

07:27.316 --> 07:30.537
Spleen, liver, kidneys,
uh, genitalia.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.539
Lot of important stuff there.

07:32.626 --> 07:35.150
Are you being flippant
with me?

07:35.237 --> 07:37.195
'My son is dead.'

07:37.282 --> 07:38.893
Forgive me. I-I was.

07:38.980 --> 07:41.025
Lost myself for a second.
Forgot where I was.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.463
But, you know, that-that's
a very beautiful painting.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.421
Very nice work, yeah.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.423
Can I talk to you
for a moment?

07:50.557 --> 07:51.819
[whispers] Quit that!

07:51.906 --> 07:53.951
- What?
- Poking the bigwig.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.736
"Poking the bigwig."

07:55.823 --> 07:59.043
Ah, I like it.
It's got a nice ring to it.

07:59.130 --> 08:02.482
I understand it's compulsion
you're not fully in control of

08:02.569 --> 08:04.179
but I wish you would try.

08:04.266 --> 08:07.269
It would make our work
a lot easier if you did...try.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.053
- Did you see that?
- What?

08:09.140 --> 08:10.794
Right outside that window.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.536
There's a pink unicorn.
Amazing!

08:13.623 --> 08:15.277
Now you're hallucinating.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.106
No. No, no, look.
It's right outside the window.

08:18.193 --> 08:20.064
Seriously, look.
It's a unicorn!

08:20.151 --> 08:21.588
I want to see!

08:24.329 --> 08:26.506
- I don't see a unicorn.
- It's right there.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.203
[whispers]
I'm trying to trick her.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.553
Oh. Yes.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.250
What a nice unicorn.

08:32.337 --> 08:33.774
'Yeah, very nice unicorn.'

08:33.861 --> 08:36.254
So you like to have
secret tea parties?

08:36.341 --> 08:38.082
How did you know
about the tea party?

08:38.169 --> 08:41.738
Oh, you know, I kind of like
secret tea parties, too.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.698
- I'm Patrick. That's Teresa.
- Hi.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.395
I'm Ashley Harrington.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.179
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- You, too.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.790
Now who's your mom and dad?

08:49.877 --> 08:51.835
Xander Harrington
and Sadie Cardozo Harrington.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.794
I know my address
and phone number, too.

08:53.881 --> 08:57.319
Very good. Patrick and I are
actually looking for your mommy.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.973
- Do you know where she is?
- Outside.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.714
We could go cheer her up.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.367
Is she sad, sweetie?

09:02.454 --> 09:05.327
She misses daddy.
He went away on a trip.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.505
'Yes, he did.'

09:12.116 --> 09:14.641
Mr. Harrington, you prodded
Heather Evans into going

09:14.728 --> 09:16.512
into your brother's office,
didn't you?

09:16.599 --> 09:18.514
I told her
the file was on the desk.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.951
What she did with that
information is her problem.

09:21.038 --> 09:23.127
You're the west coast
head of media operations

09:23.214 --> 09:26.043
and you tell an employee about
a confidential layoff list?

09:26.130 --> 09:28.742
Well, I had
a feeling she'd be grateful.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.831
And she was.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.920
You exchanged the information
for sex.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.448
Yes. I did.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.102
Gate security
has you leaving the party

09:41.189 --> 09:43.234
just before your brother died
of his injuries.

09:43.321 --> 09:46.194
I didn't know what had happened,
and I didn't particularly want

09:46.281 --> 09:49.501
to watch his coronation,
frankly. It's boring.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.809
Forgive me, Xander.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.637
Did you kill
your brother, Ed?

09:54.724 --> 09:56.465
Would you give us a second?

09:58.336 --> 09:59.990
No, I did not
kill my brother.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.905
Well, you didn't seem
that sad about his death.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.386
Well, maybe I just don't
display my emotions to cops.

10:05.735 --> 10:06.780
Maybe.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.479
Look, I'd like to tell you
that Xander and I

10:10.566 --> 10:12.350
were the best of friends,
but we weren't.

10:12.437 --> 10:15.789
We're just different people.
We weredifferent people.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.532
He'd..

10:20.620 --> 10:23.579
...always do the right things,
say the right things.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.103
Dad would say, "jump."
he'd ask, "how high?"

10:26.190 --> 10:28.149
And you?

10:28.236 --> 10:30.630
Dad never asks me to jump.

10:30.717 --> 10:34.155
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Baby, hmm?

10:34.242 --> 10:36.418
- We're going to get ice cream.
- Okay. One scoop, okay?

10:36.505 --> 10:37.941
[kisses]
No spoiling dinner.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.987
- Okay.
- One scoop it is.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.902
And I'll e-mail
you the Arizona overnights.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.860
You've got that conference call
tomorrow with the affiliates.

10:43.947 --> 10:47.603
- Okay. Thanks, Elizabeth.
- Come on.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.695
You haven't told her?

10:52.782 --> 10:54.741
[sighs]

10:54.828 --> 10:57.918
How do you tell a six-year-old
her father's never coming home?

10:58.005 --> 10:59.397
Well, she pretty much
knows already.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.356
She just doesn't
understand it yet.

11:01.443 --> 11:05.055
Nor do I. I just..

11:05.142 --> 11:09.364
I keep thinking Xander would
know exactly what to say to her.

11:09.451 --> 11:10.974
It's so stupid, huh?

11:11.061 --> 11:12.889
Xander
must have had enemies..

11:12.976 --> 11:15.326
...business rivals
that resented his success?

11:15.413 --> 11:17.938
Um...sure.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.896
Yeah, but nothing abnormal.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.858
Well, there is
the "Visualize" thing.

11:24.945 --> 11:27.861
The "Observer" is about to run
an investigative series

11:27.948 --> 11:30.167
and it's gonna be
very critical.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.517
Visualize?
The sort of religious group?

11:32.604 --> 11:34.171
No, it's more like a cult.

11:34.258 --> 11:37.174
It's brainwashing
with a sideline in tax fraud.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.699
You know, we got
a-a pretty nasty letter

11:39.786 --> 11:41.526
from their leader,
Bret Stiles

11:41.613 --> 11:44.704
threatening unspecified
trouble if we ran it.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.227
I can get you a copy.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.708
Oh, you-you had me
at "cult."

11:52.102 --> 11:54.104
Creepy.

11:54.191 --> 11:56.454
What, you don't like
giant eyeballs?

11:56.541 --> 11:58.065
No.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.851
Hi. I'm Steven Wench.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.810
Most folks call me
Brother Steve.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.637
Are you the CBI folks
who called?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.815
Yeah. Brother Patrick
and, uh, my brother Cho.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.251
[Steve]
'Well, come this way.'

12:10.338 --> 12:11.905
'I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
Mr. Stiles'

12:11.992 --> 12:13.254
isn't on the premises today.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.516
Where is he?

12:14.603 --> 12:16.431
At this precise moment,
I don't know.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.389
Bret lives spontaneously.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.827
But I'm happy to help
with any questions.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.524
I have a question.

12:22.611 --> 12:25.222
Uh, what are they doing
in there with those gizmos?

12:25.309 --> 12:28.530
That's where our technicians
assess for inner vision.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.967
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:31.054 --> 12:33.013
That sounds fun.
Can anyone do that?

12:33.100 --> 12:35.493
Um...sure.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.452
Excellent. Cho, you got
the interview, right?

12:37.539 --> 12:39.062
Just, uh, sign in.

12:39.149 --> 12:40.411
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.370
- Hey.
- Hi, I wanna go.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.633
- Have a seat.
- Cool.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.635
Excellent.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.593
Alright.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.986
[imitates buzzer]

12:50.073 --> 12:51.292
Just kidding.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.076
W-what do I do?

12:53.163 --> 12:54.643
Well, place your fingers
on the orb

12:54.730 --> 12:55.862
and, uh, tell me your name.

12:55.949 --> 12:56.993
You first.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.473
David.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.388
Hi, David. I'm Patrick.

13:00.475 --> 13:01.998
Fingers on the orb.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.962
'Do you find sadness
in the world around you?'

13:09.049 --> 13:11.312
Yes.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.837
Do you find yourself dwelling
on the misfortunes of your past?

13:16.230 --> 13:17.448
Yeah.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.191
Do you often think

13:21.278 --> 13:23.237
people are secretly
out to get you?

13:23.324 --> 13:24.934
Yes.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.459
How you doing?

13:28.546 --> 13:29.983
- How am I doing?
- Yeah.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.593
Uh, how am I doing?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.682
Well, Patrick

13:33.769 --> 13:38.034
you have serious issues
with paranoia and depression

13:38.121 --> 13:40.863
and negative thinking
in general.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.778
What?

13:42.865 --> 13:46.695
I would recommend our immersive
visualization program for you

13:46.782 --> 13:48.828
as a matter of urgency.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.833
Oh, okay. Um..

13:53.920 --> 13:56.661
do-do-do you..
Do you take that?

13:56.748 --> 13:58.881
Ah! Not so fast.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.709
You thought you had me,
didn't you?

14:04.887 --> 14:06.541
Maybe we should get going.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.151
We gotta go get a warrant.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.205
Before coming
to persecute us,

14:18.292 --> 14:21.208
did you even look
at Xander Harrington's wife?

14:21.295 --> 14:23.558
Sadie. We look at everyone, sir.
What about her?

14:23.645 --> 14:25.995
We heard there was trouble
in her marriage.

14:26.082 --> 14:30.652
If Xander divorced her,
there's a prenup.

14:30.739 --> 14:32.567
But if he dies,
she gets it all.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.047
Where'd you
hear that, Steve?

14:34.134 --> 14:36.092
Do-do you have someone
on the inside?

14:36.179 --> 14:38.181
I've said enough.
Please leave.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.574
Do you have a gift shop?

14:39.661 --> 14:41.271
'Cause I'd love
an eyeball mug or something.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.794
- No.
- Okay.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.237
[male #3]
Good job, Steven.

14:50.324 --> 14:54.545
Good job. That was...
beautifully handled.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.243
Thank you, Mr. Stiles.

14:56.330 --> 14:59.550
No, thank you.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.988
So the guy claims Stiles is only
threatening legal trouble

15:02.075 --> 15:04.468
that visualize is a religion
of science and peace.

15:04.555 --> 15:07.384
Tell that to the TV reporter
from Atlanta.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.865
Last spring,
he went off on visualize

15:09.952 --> 15:11.345
next day, he was flying
through the windshield

15:11.432 --> 15:13.042
of a member's car.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.740
One more thing. About Sadie
and Xander's marriage..

15:15.827 --> 15:17.438
An affair?

15:17.525 --> 15:19.222
No.

15:19.309 --> 15:22.399
Xander and I have been
partners in everything

15:22.486 --> 15:24.575
since the first week
of business school.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.752
I loved him,
and I respected him.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.972
I had no reason to stray.

15:30.059 --> 15:31.843
Neither did he.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.846
Sometimes you don't need
a reason.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.500
Oh.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.502
Agent Lisbon, you're here.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.113
Something to report?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.202
No, she just, um, thinks

15:42.289 --> 15:44.639
I was screwing around
on your son.

15:44.726 --> 15:48.512
Excuse me.
I have better things to do.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.732
Do you think
she was having an affair?

15:50.819 --> 15:52.603
On balance, no.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.128
Go on.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.739
Sadie loves this company,
as well as my son.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.872
She'd never risk everything
for a roll in the hay.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.484
Ambitious as all hell,
that girl.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.312
I like it.
Don't get me wrong.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.791
She's doubled our profit

16:06.878 --> 16:08.880
since she took over
running the TV stations.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.232
Um...
Excuse my rudeness.

16:12.319 --> 16:15.496
[beeps]

16:15.583 --> 16:16.888
Agent Lisbon.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.155
Get everybody
out of the house.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.070
- There's not enough time.
- Do what you can.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.028
Tara! Sadie!

16:26.115 --> 16:27.769
[cell phone rings]

16:27.856 --> 16:29.989
[groans]

16:30.076 --> 16:31.381
[beep]

16:31.468 --> 16:33.383
Hello?

16:33.470 --> 16:35.646
It's me. I need your help.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.257
Lisbon, you need my help?

16:37.344 --> 16:39.128
I need your help
finding a bomb.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.223
There's still time. You're good
at this kind of thing.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.877
If we find the bomb intact

16:48.964 --> 16:50.487
maybe we can still
get rid of it.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.620
What, are you nuts?
What do you want to do that for?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.535
It's a bomb.
Just get out of there.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.319
The guy's got comprehensive
home insurance, I'm sure.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.582
Oh, come on, Jane. We've got
two minutes. Alright?

16:58.669 --> 17:00.149
Where did they put it?

17:00.236 --> 17:02.369
They said it was somewhere
in the grand salon.

17:02.456 --> 17:03.979
Well, if they called it
the grand salon

17:04.066 --> 17:05.372
then obviously
they're insiders.

17:05.459 --> 17:06.634
Good point.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.330
Uh, l-leading us where?

17:08.417 --> 17:09.723
'Uh, let me see.'

17:09.810 --> 17:11.595
'Uh, if I was familiar
with that room'

17:11.682 --> 17:13.771
'I would plant a bomb..'

17:13.858 --> 17:17.165
'Try under the sofa.
No, no, no, no, no.'

17:17.252 --> 17:19.473
'The cupboard over by the Dutch
forgery in the corner.'

17:19.560 --> 17:22.301
Uh, th-the painting?
How do you know it's a forgery?

17:22.388 --> 17:23.999
'Eh, the brushwork,
it's all wrong.'

17:24.086 --> 17:25.392
'It's way too loose.'

17:29.309 --> 17:32.921
- Oh, my God. You were right.
- 'Yeah, well, of course.'

17:33.008 --> 17:35.097
That looser feeling didn't
develop until much later on.

17:35.184 --> 17:38.057
No! The bomb. I found it.
One minute left.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.581
Oh, good. Time to leave.
Get out of there.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.409
Lisbon, if you think
I am even gonna engage

17:42.496 --> 17:44.063
in this game
of "which wire to pull"

17:44.150 --> 17:45.368
I'm not interested.
I don't wanna play that game.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.544
'Just leave right now.
Run. Okay?'

17:47.631 --> 17:50.808
- You're right. I'm outta here.
- Thank you. Good.

17:50.895 --> 17:53.985
Where's mommy?

17:54.073 --> 17:57.467
- Hang on.
- 'Ashley?'

17:57.554 --> 18:00.079
- Ashley, we have to leave now.
- No!

18:00.166 --> 18:01.602
'Lisbon!'

18:01.689 --> 18:03.212
Ashley, get out
from under there. Ashley.

18:03.299 --> 18:04.953
No! No! I want my mommy!

18:05.040 --> 18:06.389
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on there?

18:06.476 --> 18:08.261
'Ashley, come on.'

18:08.348 --> 18:12.091
No! Leave me alone!
I want my mommy!

18:12.178 --> 18:13.962
Come out! You come out now!
That's an order!

18:14.049 --> 18:15.485
Lisbon, pick up
the girl and leave.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.008
Just pick her up
and take her outside.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.707
You can do that.
Run away now.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.100
Lisbon?

18:23.580 --> 18:24.842
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.757
Lisbon!

18:26.844 --> 18:28.672
No, no, no, no.

18:28.759 --> 18:29.978
Screw it.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.589
Lisbon!

18:47.126 --> 18:49.563
You are a very bad girl.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.652
[sighs]
You're a bad girl.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.568
[sighs]

19:00.704 --> 19:02.793
Agent Lisbon.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.360
Thank you.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.406
Thank you for saving
my granddaughter.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.234
We are so grateful.

19:08.321 --> 19:09.713
It's all part of the service.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.976
No, you were brave
and resourceful

19:12.063 --> 19:14.457
and I'll make sure
your supervisors say as much

19:14.544 --> 19:16.329
'in your file.'

19:16.416 --> 19:19.767
Look, if there's ever anything
I can do for you personally

19:19.854 --> 19:21.334
please don't hesitate.

19:21.421 --> 19:22.987
Well, you could offer her
the pad

19:23.074 --> 19:24.554
for a weekend during the summer.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.121
Actually, uh, I was wondering
if I could speak

19:26.208 --> 19:28.428
with some of your staff
who had access to that room.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.778
Ah, Edward.
Thank you for joining us.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.345
I just heard what happened.
Is everyone alright?

19:32.432 --> 19:34.173
Oh, everyone's fine. It's fine.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.652
Well, if there's anything I can
do to help

19:35.739 --> 19:37.132
just say the word. I'm here.

19:37.219 --> 19:40.266
Actually, uh, I'll be
issuing an announcement

19:40.353 --> 19:43.704
and I wanted to let
you and Sadie know first.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.185
Announcements?
Ooh, I love announcements.

19:46.272 --> 19:49.579
Um, sh-should we order up
a round of cocktails?

19:49.666 --> 19:51.233
I'll make this quick.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.931
Uh, as much as it pains me
to discuss business

19:54.018 --> 19:55.846
at a time like this..

19:55.933 --> 19:58.327
But the fact is,
we do have shareholders,

19:58.414 --> 20:01.896
and the board has demanded a new
C.E.O. be announced immediately.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.767
[whispers]
Sadie, I bet.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.819
- Uh..
- Sadie. Wow.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.517
'Uh... Ed, I-I'm sorry.'

20:14.604 --> 20:16.954
No. No, that's okay.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.696
That's.. It's your right
to name whoever you want.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.482
Uh, I-I don't know
what to say, Ed. I'm..

20:22.569 --> 20:26.181
No, it's okay. It's, um...
I get it. I get it.

20:26.268 --> 20:29.271
Um, I'm sure you'll do
a great job. Congratulations.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.713
Okay...

20:36.800 --> 20:38.672
Well, I'm not gonna
say anything.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.113
The bomb threat..
We got something.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.071
It came from the phone
of Elizabeth Stanfeld.

20:47.158 --> 20:51.162
Sadie Harrington's assistant.
Let's go get that warrant.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.555
Nice work.

20:52.642 --> 20:53.948
Thanks.

21:00.563 --> 21:03.218
Kitchen's clear.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.741
Bedroom, too.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.616
Van Pelt been
acting weird to you?

21:09.703 --> 21:12.401
Pleasedon't talk to me
about Van Pelt.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.925
No, I won't. Has she?

21:15.012 --> 21:17.276
No.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.800
It's just she's..
She's been smiling at me.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.802
No kidding.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.195
Sometimes I think
she might still be into me.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.154
That'd be weird, huh?

21:26.241 --> 21:28.417
You're weird.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.332
Cold.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.378
You know, I don't think
Stanfeld's been here in a while.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.902
Hey, check this out.

21:34.989 --> 21:37.078
"Visualize. A tool for living."

21:38.688 --> 21:41.517
'Elizabeth Stanfeld's
a member of visualize.'

21:41.604 --> 21:45.304
Looks like Bret Stiles is gonna
be talking to us after all.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.829
The eye is not
just the window to the soul.

21:48.916 --> 21:52.876
It is the key
to unlocking your greatness.

21:52.963 --> 21:54.661
It is the key

21:54.748 --> 21:58.273
because when you see it,
you will be it.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.057
[Bret]
'One more time.'

22:03.147 --> 22:06.629
The eye is not just
the window to the soul.

22:06.716 --> 22:07.978
It is the key
to unlocking your greatness.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.807
[Patrick]
'Excuse me. I'm sorry. Uh..'

22:10.894 --> 22:15.116
The eye is the key?
Or the window? Or is it both?

22:15.203 --> 22:16.596
I'm a little confused.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.467
Mr. Jane, I presume.

22:18.554 --> 22:20.426
- Yeah.
- Hello. Welcome.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.297
Oh, you're expecting us?

22:22.384 --> 22:25.996
Oh, yes. And I presume this is
your long-suffering colleague

22:26.083 --> 22:27.563
agent Lisbon.

22:27.650 --> 22:31.088
If I may say, she is
more beautiful than advertised.

22:31.175 --> 22:33.700
Oh, thanks, guy.
Take a little break. Thank you.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.789
Give us a few minutes.
Thank you.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.053
[clears throat]

22:39.140 --> 22:40.794
Elizabeth Stanfeld..

22:40.881 --> 22:44.145
...your, um... "dear friend
and fine student"

22:44.232 --> 22:46.452
she planted a bomb
at the Harringtons' house

22:46.539 --> 22:49.063
'a bomb she couldn't have
possibly made herself.'

22:49.150 --> 22:52.022
Lisbon here defused it.
Heroine.

22:52.109 --> 22:56.157
Oh. Well, I-I'm..
I mean, I may have taught her.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.159
Uh... Stanfeld?

22:58.246 --> 22:59.856
Oh.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.771
Uh, w-was she a brunette?

23:01.858 --> 23:04.121
Mr. Stiles, "dear friend"?

23:04.208 --> 23:05.688
Well, yeah, but, you know

23:05.775 --> 23:07.037
I've signed millions
of these in my time.

23:07.124 --> 23:08.822
I always like
to personalize them.

23:08.909 --> 23:11.128
It's a little trick I learned
from an old friend of mine

23:11.215 --> 23:12.869
Ronnie Reagan.

23:12.956 --> 23:15.350
So you have no knowledge
of this woman?

23:15.437 --> 23:17.004
You have no knowledge
of any attacks

23:17.091 --> 23:20.790
on the Harrington family?
That's your position, is it?

23:20.877 --> 23:23.184
No, it's not my position.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.578
Actually, it's the truth.

23:25.665 --> 23:28.972
My eyes aren't, uh...
windows or doors

23:29.059 --> 23:30.409
or even keys,
for that matter.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.975
I use 'em
to look at things

23:32.062 --> 23:34.238
and what I'm looking at
right now is a big, fat liar.

23:34.325 --> 23:37.328
[chuckles]
Really?

23:37.416 --> 23:40.810
Really. Yes. Betrayed
by a faint facial tremor.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.856
You could work on that
in the mirror.

23:42.943 --> 23:46.033
You'd get
some great results.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.687
Mm.

23:47.774 --> 23:50.559
You know, now I see why..

23:50.646 --> 23:54.563
...Red John really enjoys
sparring with you.

23:54.650 --> 23:57.131
A worthy adversary, yeah?

23:57.218 --> 23:58.437
Yes.

24:00.961 --> 24:03.485
Straight for the jugular.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.400
Obviously,
you struck a nerve.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.836
Hmm.

24:06.923 --> 24:10.274
Losing a wife and a child
like that..

24:10.361 --> 24:12.886
Well, it makes

24:12.973 --> 24:16.106
a man reckless, untethered.

24:16.193 --> 24:19.153
'Fills him with anger and shame'

24:19.240 --> 24:21.111
'that he cannot express.'

24:23.853 --> 24:27.204
Well, must makeyourjob
very hard, hmm?

24:27.291 --> 24:30.251
Yes, but the health
plan's great.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.429
[chuckles]

24:34.516 --> 24:37.171
Mr. Jane,
I think we can help you.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.955
I think we can scrub

24:39.042 --> 24:42.698
that shame and grief
and self-hatred

24:42.785 --> 24:45.222
right out of your system.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.224
Bret, please.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.794
[laughs]
We both know what you are.

24:51.881 --> 24:54.449
I mean, let's be honest here.
You're a con man.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.364
I mean, you're very charming,
and you're very good at it

24:56.451 --> 24:58.453
but you're just a con man.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.238
And you could no more help me
than you can fly to the moon.

25:01.325 --> 25:04.851
Mm.Nowwho's struck a nerve?

25:07.593 --> 25:10.334
Nobody's past helping..

25:10.421 --> 25:12.075
...even you.

25:12.162 --> 25:13.424
Believe me
when I say this, Bret

25:13.512 --> 25:14.904
you don't want
to make this personal.

25:16.732 --> 25:18.212
Now give us Stanfeld

25:18.299 --> 25:20.997
or I will make it
my sole purpose to hound you

25:21.084 --> 25:23.391
for the rest
of your miserable, phony life.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.915
[laughs]
Whoa.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.439
Am I hearing a threat here?

25:28.527 --> 25:31.399
I mean, a-aren't there rules
about this sort of thing? Hmm?

25:31.486 --> 25:33.357
Like you said, untethered.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.360
'Mr. Stiles'

25:36.447 --> 25:38.972
the percentage play here
is to give us Stanfeld.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.888
She's not gonna betray you.
She's loyal.

25:43.063 --> 25:45.152
Forget it, Lisbon.

25:45.239 --> 25:46.806
I'm bored.

25:50.287 --> 25:53.900
Elizabeth is at
Edward Harrington's penthouse.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.858
She went to Edward?
To do what?

25:55.945 --> 25:57.860
I don't know.

25:57.947 --> 26:01.168
Uh, she didn't tell me.
I gave her no instructions.

26:01.255 --> 26:04.388
She went of her
own free will.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.390
'Have a nice day.'

26:06.477 --> 26:08.915
Rigsby, get to Ed Harrington's
place immediately.

26:30.327 --> 26:32.329
[moans]

26:32.416 --> 26:34.070
Police! Don't move!

26:34.157 --> 26:36.246
- Let me see your hands! Freeze!
- Mr. Harrington?

26:36.333 --> 26:40.207
Mr. Harrington,
are you...alright?

26:40.294 --> 26:42.470
Yep. I think he's...fine.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.428
What the hell
is going on?

26:49.172 --> 26:50.696
[Rigsby]
'See, the way
it looks from here'

26:50.783 --> 26:53.046
'is that you and Elizabeth
were in this together.'

26:53.133 --> 26:54.874
Take out Xander

26:54.961 --> 26:56.832
take out your father

26:56.919 --> 26:59.400
live happily ever after
with her and Bret Stiles.

26:59.487 --> 27:03.143
No. I'm not into
that visualize crap.

27:03.230 --> 27:07.147
If I had any idea, I..
Uh, she was just..

27:07.234 --> 27:08.888
...just a friend.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.716
Convenient, though, that
she seems intent on taking out

27:10.803 --> 27:13.109
everyone between you and the top
job at Harrington media.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.241
Was Sadie next?

27:14.328 --> 27:16.156
How do you know
Iwasn't next?

27:16.243 --> 27:19.376
Visualize wanted to kill us all
because of that idiotic story.

27:19.463 --> 27:20.682
Then why didn't
she kill you, Ed?

27:20.769 --> 27:22.292
'I-I don't know.'

27:22.379 --> 27:23.946
- 'You ever meet Bret Stiles?'
- No.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.469
Anyone at all
from the visualize organization?

27:25.556 --> 27:26.645
No.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.429
So let me get this straight..

27:28.516 --> 27:30.300
she was sleeping with you
because you were a Harrington

27:30.387 --> 27:33.782
but not an important enough
Harrington to kill. Is that it?

27:33.869 --> 27:35.871
So, you're a stooge.

27:35.958 --> 27:39.005
Yeah, I'm a stooge.
Thanks for the heads-up.

27:46.142 --> 27:48.536
So Bret Stiles claims
you acted alone.

27:48.623 --> 27:50.538
But you had
an accomplice, didn't you?

27:50.625 --> 27:52.192
An accomplice to what?

27:52.279 --> 27:55.369
The bombing attempt.
We've got your phone records.

27:55.456 --> 27:57.240
Slam dunk. 20 years.

27:57.327 --> 28:01.375
2 decades.
7,000 days living in a box.

28:01.462 --> 28:02.724
'I don't know how people do it.'

28:02.811 --> 28:04.073
[Cho]
'Now help yourself out here.'

28:04.160 --> 28:05.379
We know
someone gave you that bomb.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.076
We know
you didn't kill Xander.

28:07.163 --> 28:08.948
Sadie Harrington was with you
the entire party.

28:09.035 --> 28:12.342
- Of course I didn't kill him.
- But you know who did.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.693
Give us a name,
and we can talk a deal.

28:18.087 --> 28:20.960
I'm looking down at you
from a great height.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.138
'You're like ants.'

28:25.225 --> 28:28.445
It's sad how far
I am beyond you people..

28:28.532 --> 28:30.404
...spiritually and mentally.

28:30.491 --> 28:34.103
Mm. But, uh, physically

28:34.190 --> 28:36.715
I think we, uh,
we might have the upper hand.

28:36.802 --> 28:40.283
And physically is kinda
how they roll in prison.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.937
Just because
you've stopped my work

28:42.024 --> 28:44.244
doesn't mean others
won't follow in my path.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.682
'You can't imprison the truth.'

28:47.769 --> 28:51.642
Oh, Lizzy, you are
batnuts crazy. Batnuts, girl.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.863
But that's okay. You're young.
Youcanrecover your wits.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.604
'You're gonna have to work
very hard'

28:56.691 --> 28:58.345
but you've given me
a very good idea

28:58.432 --> 28:59.563
and I thank you.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.524
Excuse me. We've come
to take my son home.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.352
This is a family matter.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.789
I'm sorry, sir, but we haven't
finished questioning him.

29:07.876 --> 29:10.923
Edward made a mistake. It was
dangerous, yes, but not criminal

29:11.010 --> 29:14.361
so unless you have some evidence
linking him to a crime

29:14.448 --> 29:15.884
I'd like you to let him go.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.625
Let the poor wretch go,
Van Pelt.

29:17.712 --> 29:21.237
He's guilty of nothing except
extremely poor decision-making

29:21.324 --> 29:23.500
sexual partner-wise,
and, uh..

29:23.587 --> 29:25.415
...who hasn't been there?

29:25.502 --> 29:27.026
Jane.

29:27.113 --> 29:29.419
It isn't in my authority
to allow that, sir

29:29.506 --> 29:31.726
'but if you'll wait a moment,
I'll find agent Lisbon'

29:31.813 --> 29:33.815
'and she may be able
to help you out.'

29:33.902 --> 29:36.426
- 'Dad?'
- 'Never mind. There he is.'

29:36.513 --> 29:38.080
'Eddie, we're leaving.'

29:40.474 --> 29:43.999
You bastard!
You stupid son of a bitch!

29:44.086 --> 29:48.308
How could you endanger us?
Ashley was nearly killed.

29:48.395 --> 29:49.875
I'm sorry.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.528
I'm gonna go wait
in the car.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.139
I'm really sorry.

29:53.226 --> 29:55.315
You're sorry? Sorry?

29:56.620 --> 29:58.622
Have you
no common sense, boy?

29:58.709 --> 30:00.146
Are you completely--

30:00.233 --> 30:02.061
Sir, you're gonna have
to take it easy.

30:02.148 --> 30:06.065
Anyhow, here we are. Let's go
home and discuss this.

30:06.152 --> 30:09.024
[Van Pelt]
'Mr. Harrington, that
isn't going to be possible.'

30:09.111 --> 30:10.373
[ring]

30:10.460 --> 30:12.506
Oh, hell. Not again.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.813
- What's wrong?
- Miserable cowards.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.903
- More threats!
- What does it say?

30:17.990 --> 30:21.863
"Next time
you won't be so lucky."

30:21.950 --> 30:24.083
Sent from the same number
as the earlier threat.

30:24.170 --> 30:26.694
I thought you had traced
that call to Stanfeld.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.087
Well, they likely use
the same number

30:28.174 --> 30:29.610
for many different cloned cells.

30:29.697 --> 30:31.394
It proves it's
the same people, anyhow.

30:31.481 --> 30:32.961
Meaning Visualize.

30:33.048 --> 30:34.920
Agent Hightower,
I'm going to need

30:35.007 --> 30:36.617
additional protection
for my family

30:36.704 --> 30:38.662
at least until we can get
to the house in London.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.751
Mr. Harrington, while your
family's safety is at stake

30:40.839 --> 30:42.928
maybe it's best
to postpone the expose.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.930
If I gave in,
where does it stop?

30:45.017 --> 30:47.149
My family would be
under constant threat

30:47.236 --> 30:50.587
from people who don't like
what I print or air.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.546
We need protection,
Agent Hightower.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.243
Mr. Harrington, the police
assigned to you

30:54.330 --> 30:57.377
are very well-trained
personnel. We can add more if--

30:57.464 --> 31:00.510
I want your best people..
Ms. Lisbon and her team.

31:00.597 --> 31:02.251
I'll insist on it.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.036
Mr. Harrington, that's
very flattering, but you--

31:04.123 --> 31:07.604
And if you could release
my son now, I'd appreciate it.

31:10.129 --> 31:12.000
I'll see what we can do.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.619
She's about to throw out
the queen of spades.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.621
Stop showing off.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.843
[sighs]

31:28.930 --> 31:30.801
Ha.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.238
[Patrick]
'That's what's called'

31:32.325 --> 31:33.761
'cutting off your nose
to spite your face.'

31:33.848 --> 31:35.154
[cell phone rings]

31:35.241 --> 31:36.590
- I'll take that. Thank you.
- Lisbon.

31:36.677 --> 31:38.200
- Goodnight, everyone.
- Goodnight.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.986
Alex, I told Ash she could stay
up if you tucked her in.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.639
- Is that okay?
- Absolutely.

31:42.726 --> 31:43.902
Thank you.

31:46.426 --> 31:47.818
Night, sweetie.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.298
Perimeter's clear, boss.

31:49.385 --> 31:51.387
'Just checked in
with the guards outside.'

31:51.474 --> 31:55.391
Gin. There you go.
Who's next? Any takers?

32:05.184 --> 32:08.491
[clicks]

32:08.578 --> 32:10.450
- Wish me luck.
- Uh-huh.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.112
- Double.
- Sure.

32:22.157 --> 32:25.117
[clatter]

32:25.204 --> 32:26.292
'Mm.'

32:26.379 --> 32:27.510
You're a lucky man.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.556
- No such thing as luck.
- Really?

32:29.643 --> 32:32.689
It's all about knowing
the odds, seizing the chances.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.735
'No luck involved.'

32:34.822 --> 32:36.606
Hogwash.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.130
Hogwash?

32:38.217 --> 32:40.567
You heard me. Hogwash.
What's that?

32:42.699 --> 32:45.093
- What?
- Shh!

32:45.180 --> 32:46.312
[Lisbon]
'What are you..'

32:46.399 --> 32:48.183
[Patrick]
'Shh!'

32:48.270 --> 32:50.533
Wait a minute.
I hear it, too.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.450
[whispers]
I got Ashley covered here.

32:56.539 --> 32:58.150
[whispers]
It's coming from in there.

32:58.237 --> 32:59.499
[whispers]
Xander's office?

32:59.586 --> 33:01.022
It's been sealed
since the murder.

33:03.155 --> 33:05.200
[sighs]

33:15.776 --> 33:17.038
[switch clicks]

33:26.395 --> 33:27.788
Clear.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.920
Wow. Could've sworn
I heard someone in here.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.490
Oh, what's this?

33:36.362 --> 33:39.191
[chuckles]
That's Ashley's.

33:39.278 --> 33:41.889
- So?
- 'That's it.'

33:41.976 --> 33:43.760
What's it?

33:43.847 --> 33:47.329
She was here.
She was right here.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.724
- What's he talking about?
- No idea.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.552
That's why she's been
so quiet and withdrawn.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.119
She witnessed the murder.

33:56.469 --> 33:57.905
[alarm wailing]

33:57.992 --> 33:59.254
[Lisbon]
'The power's been cut.'

33:59.341 --> 34:03.911
Uh...w-we have
a-a backup generator.

34:03.998 --> 34:07.219
[Van Pelt]
'Perimeter's been breached.
Someone's on the grounds.'

34:07.306 --> 34:09.134
Copy that, Van Pelt.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.745
Charlie king one,
check the grounds.

34:11.831 --> 34:14.226
Charlie king one,
do you copy?

34:14.313 --> 34:16.184
'Charlie king one?'

34:20.754 --> 34:22.060
'We're on our way
to the safe room.'

34:22.147 --> 34:23.409
'Secure Tara, Sadie
and the baby. Go!'

34:26.455 --> 34:27.456
Come on.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.545
- Seal the door now.
- Mm.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.551
[lock clicks]

34:35.638 --> 34:37.161
[voice breaks]
Grandpa?

34:40.904 --> 34:42.732
[chuckles]

34:42.819 --> 34:44.647
It's okay, honey.

34:49.522 --> 34:50.739
Don't be scared.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.092
We're safe in here.

34:56.224 --> 34:58.357
Everything's gonna be
alright.

34:59.662 --> 35:02.665
Come on.

35:02.752 --> 35:05.059
There you go.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.496
Oh, I could do
with some Chocolate.

35:07.583 --> 35:11.239
You have any, uh,
chocolate, Grace?

35:11.326 --> 35:13.285
- No.
- Just a little bit?

35:13.372 --> 35:15.983
- Van Pelt, what's the status?
- Lisbon, that was very good.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.593
I have one question.
Who the hell is Charlie king?

35:17.680 --> 35:19.421
Call it up.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.075
[taps keys]

35:21.162 --> 35:23.077
[clicks]

35:26.167 --> 35:28.343
I want mommy.

35:31.390 --> 35:35.742
Hey, you remember the party
we had a few days ago?

35:35.829 --> 35:37.091
With all the flowers
and music?

35:37.178 --> 35:38.571
That's right.

35:38.658 --> 35:41.661
You were in daddy's office
that afternoon

35:41.748 --> 35:44.446
before the guests got here
for the party, remember?

35:44.533 --> 35:46.666
Uh, were you maybe..

35:46.753 --> 35:49.234
...hiding under his desk?

35:49.321 --> 35:52.019
Playing tea party?

35:52.106 --> 35:54.978
It's alright if you were.
You won't get in trouble.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.114
Tell grandpa
the truth, sweetheart.

36:03.422 --> 36:04.771
[sighs]

36:04.858 --> 36:07.252
Ashley...

36:07.339 --> 36:09.602
'if you were there'

36:09.689 --> 36:12.518
'maybe you saw the game'

36:12.605 --> 36:15.608
'grandpa was playing
with daddy.'

36:15.695 --> 36:17.175
Did you?

36:20.134 --> 36:22.092
What the hell is going on?

36:22.180 --> 36:24.138
Uh, we--it's a very clever plan.
Would you like me to explain?

36:24.225 --> 36:26.358
Wait. Why are they in the safe
room? What are you doing?

36:26.445 --> 36:28.229
Ma'am, if you'll come with me,
I'll explain everything.

36:28.316 --> 36:29.622
'I want to know.'

36:31.363 --> 36:33.191
Thirty seconds
and I'm pulling the plug.

36:34.757 --> 36:37.064
Daddy's dead, isn't he?

36:37.151 --> 36:38.544
It was a game.

36:39.980 --> 36:44.027
When your daddy fell.. I
t was an accident.

36:44.114 --> 36:46.334
I didn't mean to do it.

36:49.381 --> 36:51.209
[lowered voice]
Cho.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.472
Put your hands
on your head.

36:53.559 --> 36:54.864
Now.

36:56.475 --> 36:58.216
You're under arrest.

37:02.481 --> 37:03.786
[sighs]

37:07.790 --> 37:10.140
You're a bastard!

37:10.228 --> 37:12.360
Uh, well,
thanks for the, uh, feedback.

37:12.447 --> 37:13.753
Always appreciated.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.711
What's wrong with grandpa?

37:15.798 --> 37:18.018
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.459
You've got nothing.

37:24.546 --> 37:27.114
My lawyers will
grind this to dust.

37:28.985 --> 37:31.161
Don't say a single thing,
either of you.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.861
They're saying I killed Xan.

37:34.948 --> 37:36.297
Well, that's not true, right?

37:37.907 --> 37:39.344
Of course not.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.084
It was very sweet
seeing you with Ashley.

37:41.171 --> 37:43.826
Uh, I guess after two sons

37:43.913 --> 37:46.002
when she came along,
it lit up your world.

37:48.004 --> 37:49.223
Strange, though,
that you can't

37:49.310 --> 37:51.007
so much as look
at your own daughter

37:51.094 --> 37:53.445
nor barely touch
your lovely wife.

37:56.709 --> 37:59.538
How'd you find out
the baby wasn't yours?

37:59.625 --> 38:01.975
I know that you believed Tara
was having an affair with Xander

38:02.062 --> 38:04.194
and that your son was
Ella's biological father.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.848
'And you were partly right.'

38:05.935 --> 38:07.241
'I mean, she was having an
affair with your son'

38:07.328 --> 38:10.592
but it wasn't with Xander.
Was it, Ed?

38:10.679 --> 38:12.377
Huh?Oh!

38:12.464 --> 38:14.335
Yeah, I figured it out
when I saw you two at the CBI.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.859
She was very angry
with you, very angry.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.470
'Pure jealousy.'

38:20.254 --> 38:21.560
Oh, my God.

38:22.474 --> 38:24.040
I'm..

38:24.127 --> 38:25.477
Ella's father.
Congratulations.

38:25.564 --> 38:27.696
She's a real peach, actually.
She's great.

38:27.783 --> 38:30.873
No. Can't be.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.701
[whispers]
I am so sorry.

38:32.788 --> 38:35.008
No! It was Xander!

38:37.837 --> 38:39.186
It was Xander.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.883
Okay. We'll take that
as a confession.

38:40.970 --> 38:43.103
- Thank you.
- Come on. Let's go.

38:43.190 --> 38:45.453
You really don't think
I can do anything, do you?

38:47.803 --> 38:50.458
- It can't be.
- Well, it is. Sorry.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.113
You killed the wrong son.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.377
[gasps]

39:02.905 --> 39:06.779
Xander and Tara
seemed too close.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.827
Always whispering together
in the corners

39:11.914 --> 39:14.743
breaking apart
when I'd come into the room.

39:14.830 --> 39:17.093
They were friends.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.400
They were probably talking
about her affair with Ed.

39:23.143 --> 39:27.103
So I ordered
a paternity test.

39:27.190 --> 39:28.627
The results came back

39:28.714 --> 39:30.585
the day of the party.

39:33.414 --> 39:36.417
Ella is not my child..

39:36.504 --> 39:38.637
...but you know
that already, don't you?

39:38.724 --> 39:40.378
What did you expect, dad?

39:40.465 --> 39:42.554
You treat her like just another
one of your possessions

39:42.641 --> 39:43.816
but she's not!

39:43.903 --> 39:45.687
[Alex]
'I confronted Xan.'

39:45.774 --> 39:48.081
- You betrayed me!
- He didn't deny it.

39:50.997 --> 39:54.087
Why didn't he just deny it?

39:54.174 --> 39:56.872
[Patrick]
'He just naturally assumed
you knew it was Ed.'

39:56.959 --> 39:59.048
You!

39:59.135 --> 40:00.746
Aah!

40:00.833 --> 40:02.748
When I think..

40:04.271 --> 40:07.840
...of what poor Ashley saw..

40:07.927 --> 40:10.059
...she didn't see anything.
I made it up.

40:12.801 --> 40:14.281
But the teacup,
she was there.

40:14.368 --> 40:16.849
[whispers]
Yes, I know.

40:16.936 --> 40:19.417
But it's all in the wrist.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.477
[Bret]
'My good friend Senator Aleman'

40:36.564 --> 40:38.610
is very concerned
about my treatment.

40:38.697 --> 40:41.134
Of course, youdoknow
the good senator, huh?

40:41.221 --> 40:43.136
Chair of
the justice committee.

40:43.223 --> 40:45.138
I know him.

40:45.225 --> 40:47.880
Bret Stiles.
Good to see you.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.447
Looking sharp.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.753
[clears throat]
I mean, I'd hate to tell him

40:51.840 --> 40:55.975
that you failed to resolve
this matter.

40:56.062 --> 40:57.716
So why don't we
resolve it right now?

40:57.803 --> 40:59.413
- Mm.
- Good.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.981
Patrick, Mr. Stiles
here says that

41:02.068 --> 41:05.114
you antagonized him
and conducted yourself

41:05.201 --> 41:07.116
in a way that reflected
poorly on the bureau.

41:07.203 --> 41:08.596
Do you have anything
to say?

41:10.468 --> 41:13.166
Uh, no.
I'm-I'm good, thanks.

41:13.253 --> 41:14.776
Okay.

41:14.863 --> 41:16.256
Actually, there's one thing
I'd like to say.

41:16.343 --> 41:17.866
Is this gonna be helpful,
Patrick?

41:17.953 --> 41:19.564
- Probably not.
- Okay, then, there you go.

41:19.651 --> 41:21.957
Nice talking with you.

41:22.044 --> 41:24.917
What? You're-you're kidding,
right? That's it?

41:25.004 --> 41:27.963
No. Do give my best
to Senator Aleman.

41:28.050 --> 41:30.400
Is he still seeing
that stripper in Bakersfield?

41:32.054 --> 41:33.665
'Lovely girl.'

41:37.451 --> 41:38.974
Well, well.

41:41.107 --> 41:43.936
I can see that
I've met my match here.

41:44.023 --> 41:45.720
You two..

41:45.807 --> 41:47.592
...quite the double act.

41:47.679 --> 41:50.464
Ah. I will retreat,
chastened.

41:54.120 --> 41:56.035
By the way..

41:58.559 --> 42:01.431
...we will find a way to charge
you with that attempted bombing.

42:03.259 --> 42:05.523
Miss Hightower, shh.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.525
Don't push your luck.

42:11.311 --> 42:12.834
So long, Bret.

42:14.967 --> 42:17.709
Don't draw the
wrong lesson here, Patrick.

42:17.796 --> 42:19.493
I've got Stiles checkmated.

42:19.580 --> 42:22.061
But if a player
with real juice came in here

42:22.148 --> 42:25.412
I'd want to see
you dance for him.

42:25.499 --> 42:27.588
Isn't that what we just did?

42:27.675 --> 42:29.503
You know what I mean.

42:29.590 --> 42:31.244
Okay.

42:31.331 --> 42:33.115
And I do love to dance.

42:46.259 --> 42:48.740
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
