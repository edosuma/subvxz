Will!

00:17.103 --> 00:18.766
This is not good!

00:20.569 --> 00:22.136
Dammit, it's not working.

00:22.138 --> 00:23.834
Boost to full power!

00:23.836 --> 00:24.903
No, no, no,
hold on a second.

00:24.905 --> 00:26.204
Please...

00:26.206 --> 00:27.669
Don't do this.

00:27.671 --> 00:29.671
Please, don't do this.

00:40.813 --> 00:42.549
Oi!

00:42.551 --> 00:43.851
Where are you going?

00:43.853 --> 00:45.253
Just keep it
in here!

01:16.293 --> 01:19.160
A full stun charge
did bugger-all.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.897
Are you sure
you've never seen

01:20.899 --> 01:21.832
anything
like this before?

01:21.834 --> 01:23.869
This is entirely new.

01:31.113 --> 01:32.747
Abby...

01:32.749 --> 01:34.916

Someone needs to stay with her
at all times.

01:52.644 --> 01:54.444
Agreed.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.247
It's okay, Deco.

01:58.249 --> 02:00.650
We'll make the place
nice for her, mate.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.393
You said
this would stop.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.526
I know.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.095
Something's preventing

02:10.097 --> 02:12.531
the DNA inhibitors
from working.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.333
Three transformations
in 24 hours?

02:15.335 --> 02:17.736
Magnus, she's getting
stronger and crazier.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.506
I realize that, Will.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.411
We'll find something,
I promise.

02:24.413 --> 02:26.013
Get in touch with Henry.

02:26.015 --> 02:28.115
I'll be in the lab.

02:37.692 --> 02:40.828
We're backtracking
from the first incident.

02:40.830 --> 02:43.330
Look, I know
things are crazy over there,

02:43.332 --> 02:45.065
but seriously,

02:45.067 --> 02:49.336
it's like working with one hand
tied behind my back here.

02:49.338 --> 02:51.004
Uh, okay.

02:51.006 --> 02:54.240
I'm just going to pretend that's
your frustration talking--

02:55.609 --> 02:57.544
and you're welcome.

03:06.121 --> 03:07.188
How is she?

03:07.190 --> 03:08.356
She's not good.

03:08.358 --> 03:09.724
Another episode?

03:09.726 --> 03:11.159
She's sedated now.

03:11.161 --> 03:12.527
She's under watch.

03:12.529 --> 03:14.096
Dr. Magnus said
that she'd be fine.

03:14.098 --> 03:16.732
These things take time, Gavin.

03:16.734 --> 03:18.434
It would be nice
if we could find something

03:18.436 --> 03:19.768
to help her out.

03:19.770 --> 03:21.804
Well, I don't even know
what we're looking for.

03:21.806 --> 03:23.806
A cocoon? A husk?
Excrement?

03:23.808 --> 03:25.474
Okay, will you stop
with the list-making already?

03:25.476 --> 03:26.308
Please?

03:26.310 --> 03:27.609
Sorry.

03:27.611 --> 03:28.677
And stop with
the constant apologizing!

03:28.679 --> 03:30.412
Sorry.

03:30.414 --> 03:31.546
My mother was...

03:31.548 --> 03:32.481
Canadian.

03:33.616 --> 03:35.517
Mazel tov.

03:35.519 --> 03:38.286
Okay, so, you get the call,

03:38.288 --> 03:40.222
and it's about a...

03:40.224 --> 03:41.590
Super-large gorilla, really?

03:41.592 --> 03:45.494
Well, protocol is
we check every tip.

03:45.496 --> 03:47.663
Which began here,

03:47.665 --> 03:48.764
a block by block search.

03:48.766 --> 03:51.101
Which we just retraced.

03:51.103 --> 03:53.804
Now, are you sure
you never found, saw,

03:53.806 --> 03:54.871
smelled anything?

03:54.873 --> 03:56.773
No.

03:56.775 --> 04:00.310
Just suddenly
Abby wasn't Abby anymore.

04:01.914 --> 04:03.347
I didn't know people
could change like that.

04:03.349 --> 04:04.581
Yeah, well, they can.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.617
Some of us more than others.

04:06.619 --> 04:09.820
It's just rare to be able
to control it like I do.

04:10.955 --> 04:12.455
S-sorry, you...

04:12.457 --> 04:14.491
You mean you can change into...

04:14.493 --> 04:16.426
Know what a werewolf is?

04:16.428 --> 04:17.327
Close enough.

04:18.963 --> 04:20.230
Oh, my God.

04:20.232 --> 04:22.500
Oh, don't worry, Gavin.

04:22.502 --> 04:24.969
I haven't devoured a Canadian
in months.

04:31.678 --> 04:33.847
You've been studying
transformations

04:33.849 --> 04:34.981
since the 19th century,

04:34.983 --> 04:36.216
and still we're in
the dark about this?

04:36.218 --> 04:39.519
I am trying everything, Will.

04:39.521 --> 04:42.589
Every DNA lock I try,
the creature overcomes it.

04:42.591 --> 04:44.357
This is a genetic tidal wave,

04:44.359 --> 04:45.758
and I have no idea
how to stop it,

04:45.760 --> 04:47.060
let alone what started it.

04:47.062 --> 04:49.428
It's a virus,
she's the host...

04:52.999 --> 04:54.967
I will find a way.

04:56.636 --> 05:00.305
I know what it's like, Magnus,

05:00.307 --> 05:02.574
to lose yourself.

05:02.576 --> 05:04.477
It's happened to me twice.

05:04.479 --> 05:06.346
When your body

05:06.348 --> 05:07.347
is not your own.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.416
I need information,

05:09.418 --> 05:11.985
anything to help us understand
what we're dealing with.

05:14.288 --> 05:16.690
I'm going to reduce
her meds slightly

05:16.692 --> 05:18.992
just to let her
resurface.

05:18.994 --> 05:20.493
It's so risky, Magnus.

05:20.495 --> 05:22.595
You need to talk to her, Will.

05:22.597 --> 05:25.598
You need to try to keep her
grounded in this reality

05:25.600 --> 05:26.465
if you can.

05:26.467 --> 05:29.402
Anything,
no matter how obscure,

05:29.404 --> 05:31.337
could give us
a way to cure her.

05:32.973 --> 05:36.275
I know how close you two are,

05:36.277 --> 05:38.511
and that may be our best weapon
at this point.

05:45.819 --> 05:46.785
I'm sorry.

05:46.787 --> 05:49.354
It's all right.

05:50.356 --> 05:52.824
We'll fix this.

05:52.826 --> 05:54.893
We always do.

06:29.462 --> 06:31.497
The same?

06:31.499 --> 06:32.665
No seizures,
no transformations

06:32.667 --> 06:35.367
for the past four hours.

06:35.369 --> 06:36.769
Get some rest.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.637
I've got her.

06:38.639 --> 06:40.505
I'm fine.

06:40.507 --> 06:42.608
You've been with her
for two days, Will.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.677
You need food
and sleep.

06:46.914 --> 06:48.015
I'm not leaving her.

06:51.720 --> 06:52.753
Okay, then.

06:52.755 --> 06:53.788
Me neither.

06:55.024 --> 06:57.125
Music?

06:57.127 --> 06:58.093
Yeah, sure.

06:58.095 --> 06:59.428
Nothing too loud, though.

06:59.430 --> 07:01.130
Don't worry, mate.

08:03.084 --> 08:07.352
So when she speaks,
it comes out as song?

08:07.354 --> 08:08.520
Because her DNA
is being over-written,

08:08.522 --> 08:09.688
she can only perceive

certain harmonic

we can't exactly call in
a full forensics team--

10:50.649 --> 10:52.482
your call, not mine--

10:52.484 --> 10:53.716
I say we do
a door-to-door canvassing

10:53.718 --> 10:54.917
of the neighborhood.

10:54.919 --> 10:56.452
Someone's got to have seen
or heard something.

10:56.454 --> 11:00.490
If someone saw something,
it would be headline news.

11:00.492 --> 11:02.192
Most abnormals are pretty good
at staying out of sight.

11:02.194 --> 11:04.228
Yes, we're dealing
with monsters,

11:04.230 --> 11:06.598
but the basic tenets
of detective work

11:06.600 --> 11:07.732
still apply here--

11:07.734 --> 11:09.568
Dude...

11:09.570 --> 11:10.569
Sorry.

11:10.571 --> 11:12.071
I said the "M" word.

11:12.073 --> 11:14.107
Please don't werewolf on me.

11:14.109 --> 11:16.109
HAP.

11:16.111 --> 11:18.044
Hyper-accelerated--

11:18.046 --> 11:19.279
never mind.

11:20.281 --> 11:23.549
Scan the area, full spectrum.

11:24.751 --> 11:25.884
Where are you going?

11:27.620 --> 11:29.020
I'm going to talk to
Red List dealers

11:29.022 --> 11:30.621
in the area.

11:30.623 --> 11:31.656
Criminals?

11:31.658 --> 11:33.691
Yes, criminals,

11:33.693 --> 11:35.626
which is why I'm not
bringing you with me.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.194
Might as well have
a big sign on you

11:37.196 --> 11:38.262
that says "narc."

11:39.264 --> 11:40.664
Call me if you find anything.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.278
Uh, Henry?

11:54.280 --> 11:57.015
I said I'll be back!

11:57.017 --> 11:59.817
I found something.

12:10.332 --> 12:11.765
Thermal residue.

12:14.135 --> 12:15.703
It's coming from...

12:32.352 --> 12:35.987
That is a cocoon,
isn't it?

12:40.626 --> 12:42.828
You say you found this
against a brick wall?

12:42.830 --> 12:43.962
Behind some garbage.

12:43.964 --> 12:48.000
Actually
I found... it.

12:48.002 --> 12:49.235
So, what is it,
Red List?

12:49.237 --> 12:50.636
Likely.

12:50.638 --> 12:52.038
It's very similar

12:52.040 --> 12:54.007
to the larval pocket
of a galvanic blood tick.

12:54.009 --> 12:55.676
Um, what?

12:55.678 --> 12:58.378
They often partner
with parasitical organisms,

12:58.380 --> 13:02.015
ones specifically designed
to mutate human DNA.

13:02.017 --> 13:03.750
They're extremely rare.

13:03.752 --> 13:05.785
One would never be found
in an urban environment

13:05.787 --> 13:06.619
by accident.

13:06.621 --> 13:07.854
Which means this cocoon

13:07.856 --> 13:09.622
was deliberately placed
in that alleyway

13:09.624 --> 13:11.824
in order to test this parasite
on a human victim.

13:11.826 --> 13:13.392
So somebody
puts the parasite

13:13.394 --> 13:15.194
into the blood tick,

13:15.196 --> 13:17.029
Abby finds
the blood tick cocoon...

13:17.031 --> 13:19.365
And becomes infected
with a microscopic parasite

13:19.367 --> 13:21.067
we've never even
heard of before.

13:21.069 --> 13:22.235
Wait, the cocoon was
placed in the alley

13:22.237 --> 13:23.236
by whom?

13:24.939 --> 13:26.039
Hollow Earth insurgents.

13:26.041 --> 13:27.340
We've never seen
a parasite

13:27.342 --> 13:28.675
mutate this rapidly.

13:28.677 --> 13:29.943
We can't even identify it.

13:29.945 --> 13:31.979
So all these
angry monsters--

13:31.981 --> 13:34.682
abnormals--

13:34.684 --> 13:36.351
from the center
of the earth.

13:36.353 --> 13:37.185
They did this?

13:37.187 --> 13:39.755
They're tracking us.

13:39.757 --> 13:40.989
They would have known

13:40.991 --> 13:42.857
that Abby is connected,
however discreetly,

13:42.859 --> 13:43.992
to my Sanctuary.

13:43.994 --> 13:45.026
They'd want to know

13:45.028 --> 13:46.461
if I could prevent
the mutation or not.

13:46.463 --> 13:47.428
You were totally set up.

13:47.430 --> 13:48.830
Doc, this is very bad.

13:48.832 --> 13:50.431
If that creature becomes
fully realized,

13:50.433 --> 13:53.034
then normal human beings
will become a means

13:53.036 --> 13:56.004
to populate the surface
with Hollow Earth abnormals.

13:56.006 --> 13:57.939
Total foothold
scenario.

13:57.941 --> 13:59.373
So Abby
is a test case

13:59.375 --> 14:02.844
for a full-on
monster invasion.

14:02.846 --> 14:05.246
Excuse me.

14:05.248 --> 14:08.216
I need to go throw up.

14:16.059 --> 14:19.795
My mom used to sing to me.

14:23.799 --> 14:26.868
In fact, when I...

14:26.870 --> 14:28.704
When I can't remember her voice,

14:28.706 --> 14:31.406
I just think of
all those cheesy songs

14:31.408 --> 14:32.908
she used to sing to me.

14:34.344 --> 14:36.211
If I...

14:36.213 --> 14:39.047
If I fell down,
or if I couldn't sleep,

14:39.049 --> 14:42.484
if I had a nightmare,

14:42.486 --> 14:44.085
she'd sing to me.

14:49.125 --> 14:52.327
And then after she died...

14:57.900 --> 15:02.503
So thanks...

15:02.505 --> 15:04.337
for contracting
the one condition

15:04.339 --> 15:06.806
that makes me
do something I hate.

15:10.777 --> 15:14.079
Look, I'll make you a deal.

15:16.782 --> 15:20.318
I'll try to sing...

15:20.320 --> 15:24.857
If you stick around
a little while longer.

15:26.260 --> 15:29.763
That sound
like a deal?

16:24.188 --> 16:25.254

Okay, I...

Maybe I'll rejoin the FBI,

<i>Hello, Helen.</i>

21:14.055 --> 21:14.821
<i>Some problems,</i>
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

21:14.823 --> 21:16.322
Complications
have arisen.

21:16.324 --> 21:17.690
<i>Need some answers right away--</i>

21:17.692 --> 21:19.158
<i>a few concerns</i>
<i>about our direction--</i>

21:19.160 --> 21:20.226
okay, one at a--

21:20.228 --> 21:21.527
the sand Ray's
giving birth

21:21.529 --> 21:22.895
in a zone that's
not been cleared.

21:22.897 --> 21:23.896
<i>Funds have</i>
<i>been diverted</i>

21:23.898 --> 21:25.297
<i>to a traceable account.</i>

21:25.299 --> 21:27.499
<i>People are not safe</i>
<i>in the city any longer.</i>

21:27.501 --> 21:28.800
<i>The government's asking</i>
<i>for our tax returns.</i>

21:28.802 --> 21:30.569
Fine, let me--

21:30.571 --> 21:32.470
<i>I suggest you switch to gold.</i>
<i>It's easier to unload.</i>

21:32.472 --> 21:33.471
Is there something
we can give her

21:33.473 --> 21:35.406
to ease her labor pains?

21:35.408 --> 21:37.308
<i>I don't like</i>
<i>the use of force,</i>

21:37.310 --> 21:38.809
<i>but we need</i>
<i>some more protection.</i>

21:38.811 --> 21:41.445
<i>A dummy corporation</i>
<i>won't make this go away.</i>

21:43.916 --> 21:45.717
<i>We need</i>
<i>a new accountant.</i>

21:45.719 --> 21:46.851
<i>A shipment of new guns.</i>

21:46.853 --> 21:48.287
<i>I think she's having triplets.</i>

21:48.289 --> 21:50.289
<i>We need to transfer funds.</i>

21:50.291 --> 21:51.523
<i>Risk of</i>
<i>intervention...</i>

21:51.525 --> 21:52.891
<i>Risk of losing lives...</i>

21:52.893 --> 21:54.626
<i>Risk of going bankrupt.</i>

21:54.628 --> 21:56.228
Risk of getting hives.

21:56.230 --> 21:57.963
<i>I love money!</i>

21:57.965 --> 21:58.797
Stop!

22:00.667 --> 22:03.435
The sand ray needs some sugar,
and keep her in the shade.

22:03.437 --> 22:05.771
Gold's a bold suggestion,
but too risky, I'm afraid.

22:05.773 --> 22:09.407
Who cares about an audit?
We've been through that before.

22:09.409 --> 22:11.876
Your guns arrive tomorrow.
Let me know if you need more.

22:11.878 --> 22:12.710
But--

22:12.712 --> 22:13.444
<i>thank you.</i>

22:13.446 --> 22:14.846
<i>Doctor!</i>

22:14.848 --> 22:16.780
Risk in doing business?
Since when is that hot news?

22:16.782 --> 22:18.115
Have we ever shied away

22:18.117 --> 22:20.250
from things
that others wouldn't do?

22:20.252 --> 22:22.652
If you think we've lost our way,
feel free to step aside.

22:22.654 --> 22:26.223
There's other pressing business.
I'm afraid we're out of time.

How bad?

26:31.418 --> 26:35.721
Completely new pathways
in half her cerebral cortex.

26:35.723 --> 26:38.858
You said the singing
would help keep her human.

26:38.860 --> 26:39.892
And it did...

26:39.894 --> 26:42.829
Temporarily.

26:44.198 --> 26:45.698
We've tried
every musical key,

26:45.700 --> 26:48.634
even subsonic frequencies.

26:48.636 --> 26:50.669
This isn't a virus, Will.

26:50.671 --> 26:52.404
This is a new life form

26:52.406 --> 26:56.574
overtaking

26:58.277 --> 26:59.277
You think

27:01.447 --> 27:03.781
I think...

We should prepare for the worst.

27:04.817 --> 27:06.851
No, no.

27:06.853 --> 27:08.686
I do not accept that, okay?

27:08.688 --> 27:09.721
There is a way to save her.

27:09.723 --> 27:10.722
We just haven't found it yet.

27:10.724 --> 27:12.858
The timeline is not good.

27:12.860 --> 27:14.393
Well, then put her on ice
until we can understand this.

27:14.395 --> 27:16.929
Cryogenics might just
kill her outright,

27:16.931 --> 27:19.565
or make the creature
even stronger.

27:19.567 --> 27:20.466
We have no idea.

27:20.468 --> 27:21.868
Well, figure it out!

27:25.473 --> 27:27.473
What is the point
of this entire place

27:27.475 --> 27:29.942
if we can't save
the people that...

27:34.514 --> 27:35.880
Oh, Magnus...

27:39.218 --> 27:40.818
It's not over yet.

29:25.624 --> 29:26.824
It makes sense.

29:26.826 --> 29:29.926
Do you see it now,
sweetheart?

29:32.363 --> 29:33.997
Thank you, father.

29:33.999 --> 29:38.402
Never lose faith.

29:43.975 --> 29:46.843
All right,
I'm listening.

29:46.845 --> 29:48.311
Of course
there are risks,

29:48.313 --> 29:49.712
but hear me out.

29:49.714 --> 29:51.414
My father had a theory

29:51.416 --> 29:53.016
about the origins
of abnormal life,

29:53.018 --> 29:54.417
specifically that

29:54.419 --> 29:56.619
of the most powerful
beings amongst us--

29:56.621 --> 29:59.021
vampires, haps,
shape-shifters--

29:59.023 --> 30:00.856
that their particular DNA

30:00.858 --> 30:02.958
aggressively sought
to define itself.

30:02.960 --> 30:03.992
Which is how
those races were born.

30:03.994 --> 30:05.694
Exactly.

30:05.696 --> 30:07.797
Now, she is being
consumed by cells

30:07.799 --> 30:11.568
that are determined to
become something more.

30:11.570 --> 30:15.405
I've been working
on this night and day.

30:15.407 --> 30:17.741
This is the only
solution we have, Will.

30:21.847 --> 30:23.147
Tell me.

30:23.149 --> 30:26.516
If we harvest a larval
segmented annelid,

30:26.518 --> 30:28.585
and implant it
into her stomach wall,

30:28.587 --> 30:30.020
there is a chance

30:30.022 --> 30:32.056
that the invading DNA
will be attracted

30:32.058 --> 30:34.091
to the simpler,
more malleable life form.

30:34.093 --> 30:36.761
Wait a second, so...

30:36.763 --> 30:39.864
You're talking about
creating another creature

30:39.866 --> 30:40.864
and putting it inside of Abby?

30:40.866 --> 30:42.032
If it takes,

30:42.034 --> 30:43.834
the annelid will develop
rapidly, within hours,

30:43.836 --> 30:45.402
but Abby's system

30:45.404 --> 30:47.405
will sustain
no further damage.

30:47.407 --> 30:49.107
Okay, that sounds positive.

30:50.510 --> 30:51.977
Until...

30:51.979 --> 30:54.147
the new life form
reaches maturity.

30:54.149 --> 30:57.551
At which point, it will emerge
from her body...

30:57.553 --> 30:59.086
Rather violently.

31:08.058 --> 31:10.825
This is your solution?

31:10.827 --> 31:13.160
Why don't you just
bore a hole in her brain,

31:13.162 --> 31:14.362
or use leeches?

31:14.364 --> 31:15.863
Once this new creature
leaves her body,

31:15.865 --> 31:17.097
I can save her--

31:17.099 --> 31:19.200
Are you willing
to bet her life on that?

31:19.202 --> 31:20.768
Because I'm not.

31:20.770 --> 31:23.938
There will be trauma, Will,
I realize,

31:23.940 --> 31:24.806
but if I time this right--

31:24.808 --> 31:26.107
No.

31:26.109 --> 31:28.175
That's not
what's happening here, is it?

31:29.911 --> 31:31.778
See, you're so intoxicated
by the possibility

31:31.780 --> 31:32.979
of creating

31:32.981 --> 31:34.147
some amazing
new "life form"

31:34.149 --> 31:37.216
that you're ignoring
other options.

31:37.218 --> 31:39.819
That is not the case,
I assure you.

31:39.821 --> 31:42.287
Growing a monster
inside my girlfriend,

31:42.289 --> 31:44.022
and then patching her up
after it chews its way out

31:44.024 --> 31:45.323
is not an answer!

31:45.325 --> 31:46.958
I've already started
an ovulation cycle

31:46.960 --> 31:47.793
on the annelid.

31:47.795 --> 31:49.061
What?

31:49.063 --> 31:49.828
I intend to
harvest the larva

31:49.830 --> 31:50.562
within the hour--

31:50.564 --> 31:51.897
Like hell you will.

31:51.899 --> 31:56.201
My only concern
is for Abby's well being.

31:56.203 --> 31:57.870
It's my call.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.238
This is what we're doing, Will.

32:00.807 --> 32:03.075
We'll see about that.

32:14.720 --> 32:18.389
Henry, Declan,
we have a situation.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.361
Nice work, H.
Your finest hour.

32:24.363 --> 32:25.462
Will--

32:25.464 --> 32:26.864
you too, Deco.
Hope you're proud.

32:26.866 --> 32:28.800
The Doc is trying
to save her life.

32:28.802 --> 32:30.001
If it were Erika
down there,

32:30.003 --> 32:31.169
you wouldn't be
such a suck-ass right now!

32:31.171 --> 32:32.103
Dude, don't push me.

32:32.105 --> 32:32.971
Oh, I'm just
gettin' started!

32:32.973 --> 32:36.075
That's enough, both of you!

32:37.277 --> 32:40.113
As soon as this is over,
you're free.

32:52.027 --> 32:53.159
Watch him.

32:53.161 --> 32:55.027
Magnus' orders.

33:07.774 --> 33:10.008
You are sure
about this?

33:11.411 --> 33:14.113
Prep the O.R.

33:14.115 --> 33:15.848
You know,

33:15.850 --> 33:18.518
I've done combat medicine,
but I'm not a surgeon.

33:20.121 --> 33:21.522
If you'd rather someone
else was with you...

33:23.058 --> 33:24.960
We're dealing with
a hybrid species, Declan.

33:24.962 --> 33:26.962
If something goes wrong,
I need you there.

33:35.104 --> 33:36.872
Upper abdomen
for the incision point.

33:38.174 --> 33:39.508
Scalpel.

33:52.288 --> 33:53.989
What about
patient consent?

33:53.991 --> 33:54.890
It's not your call.

33:54.892 --> 33:56.225
Doesn't that
count for anything?

33:56.227 --> 33:57.893
It'll be over soon,
so just take--

33:57.895 --> 33:59.428
She's gonna be
dead soon, Henry!

33:59.430 --> 34:01.430
You're letting your emotions
run the game, dude.

34:01.432 --> 34:03.264
Oh, and what are you
suddenly, huh?

34:03.266 --> 34:04.299
Mr. Stoic?

34:04.301 --> 34:06.534
I trust Magnus, Will.

34:06.536 --> 34:09.504
So should you.

34:09.505 --> 34:12.541
Please, man...

34:12.543 --> 34:14.909
Please, Henry?

34:14.911 --> 34:17.079
I've got to get out of here!

34:17.081 --> 34:18.246
I gotta get out of here!

34:24.353 --> 34:25.219
Don't do it!

34:32.094 --> 34:33.027
534...

34:34.164 --> 34:35.297
534!

34:43.840 --> 34:45.107
Thanks.

34:45.109 --> 34:47.275
You're welcome.

34:50.813 --> 34:52.982
Gestation time, two hours.

34:52.984 --> 34:55.884
Ultrasound shows rapid growth,
but no movement.

34:58.255 --> 34:59.954
Blood pressure's crashing.

35:01.256 --> 35:02.423
Six units of blood
on standby.

35:02.425 --> 35:04.258
Saline wide open.

35:04.260 --> 35:05.092
We'll need containment.

35:05.094 --> 35:06.527
On it.

35:10.599 --> 35:12.467
This is happening more
rapidly than I'd hoped.

35:12.469 --> 35:14.369
Heart rate's in the red.

35:14.371 --> 35:16.172
She's going into shock.

35:19.076 --> 35:19.910
Keep this IV in her!

35:28.152 --> 35:28.985
Magnus!

35:28.987 --> 35:30.120
Keep her still!

35:30.122 --> 35:31.354
I need to give it an exit point!

35:33.391 --> 35:34.324
There's too much movement.

35:34.326 --> 35:36.159
I can't make a clean incision.

35:36.161 --> 35:37.928
She needs more sedation!

35:44.502 --> 35:45.335
Dear God.

35:59.797 --> 36:02.833
Containment,
quickly!

36:06.537 --> 36:08.138
One milligram EPI, stat!

36:09.774 --> 36:11.342
Magnus...

36:15.514 --> 36:18.450
Crash cart!

36:32.298 --> 36:35.834
Charging!

36:35.836 --> 36:36.868
Clear!

36:40.573 --> 36:44.175
♪ Just stay... ♪

36:44.177 --> 36:45.009
Clear!

36:45.011 --> 36:46.277
♪ Just stay... ♪

36:46.279 --> 36:47.945
No.

36:47.947 --> 36:49.280
Again! 360!

36:49.282 --> 36:50.147
Charging!

36:50.149 --> 36:51.482
Clear!

36:57.324 --> 36:59.357
We got her.

37:39.432 --> 37:42.333
Hey, you.

37:42.335 --> 37:45.037
Hey.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.308
You okay?

37:52.679 --> 37:55.215
Traumatized.

37:55.217 --> 37:58.519
But too much singing
will do that to a person.

37:58.521 --> 38:00.987
From what I heard,
it was...

38:00.989 --> 38:03.323
kinda romantic.

38:07.994 --> 38:11.230
I'm okay.

38:11.232 --> 38:12.998
Come here.

38:17.536 --> 38:23.207
I'm okay. Really.

38:23.209 --> 38:26.644
I won't be wearing a bikini
anytime soon.

38:34.154 --> 38:36.690
This time I was sure...

38:36.692 --> 38:37.725
I mean, I really thought--

38:37.727 --> 38:39.493
Hey.

38:40.996 --> 38:44.165
If this doesn't disaster-proof
our relationship,

38:44.167 --> 38:45.733
nothing will.

38:50.372 --> 38:53.107
I feel like I'm cursed.

38:54.676 --> 38:57.478
I feel like...

38:57.480 --> 39:01.415
Anybody who gets close to me
has got a target on their back.

39:03.051 --> 39:04.652
But you didn't
lose me.

39:06.422 --> 39:09.224
And you won't.

39:09.226 --> 39:11.025
Okay?

39:15.164 --> 39:17.598
I can handle monsters.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.401
I can handle death.

39:20.403 --> 39:24.672
But I can't...Handle...
Singing.

39:26.075 --> 39:27.242
But you're so good at it.

39:27.244 --> 39:30.111
No, I'm not good at it,
so just stop, okay?

39:30.113 --> 39:32.380
And I have a mountain
of paperwork to do

39:32.382 --> 39:34.349
because of you, so...
You owe me.

39:34.351 --> 39:36.584
Go.

39:36.586 --> 39:38.386
I'll be here.

40:18.192 --> 40:19.726
There you are.

40:19.728 --> 40:22.629
Haven't seen you
all day.

40:22.631 --> 40:24.631
I just needed
some space.

40:24.633 --> 40:27.168
As long as you're not
hiding from me.

40:27.170 --> 40:29.770
No.

40:29.772 --> 40:34.609
Will, you obviously have
something to say to me.

40:34.611 --> 40:37.746
Besides thank you
for saving her?

40:39.116 --> 40:42.184
That's not very sincere.

40:42.186 --> 40:45.688
Out with it, please.

40:50.093 --> 40:52.094
It worked.

40:52.096 --> 40:54.295
It did, but...

40:54.297 --> 40:56.097
That procedure should have

40:56.099 --> 40:59.567
never happened.

40:59.569 --> 41:00.601
But you never met
a compromise

41:00.603 --> 41:04.138
you didn't steamroll
right through.

41:06.308 --> 41:08.676
This hit close to home...

41:10.145 --> 41:12.713
And...

41:12.715 --> 41:16.550
You shut me down.

41:16.552 --> 41:19.419
You've been
a wonderful soldier, Will.

41:19.421 --> 41:21.889
You have done everything
I've asked you, and more.

41:21.891 --> 41:23.691
You could run
this Sanctuary,

41:23.693 --> 41:27.529
hell, the entire network,
brilliantly.

41:27.531 --> 41:30.332
Because you always fight
for what you believe is right.

41:30.334 --> 41:35.203
Even when we disagree.

41:35.205 --> 41:36.772
I'm not too proud to admit

41:36.774 --> 41:40.342
that I am <i> very</i> used
to getting my own way.

41:40.344 --> 41:41.510
Sometimes to a fault.

41:41.512 --> 41:42.745
Right...

41:42.747 --> 41:44.212
Don't think
you're going to melt me

41:44.214 --> 41:45.680
with that...

41:45.682 --> 41:46.448
...British charm of yours.

41:46.450 --> 41:49.484
Perish forbid.

41:52.321 --> 41:53.788
You never
compromise, Will,

41:53.790 --> 41:58.792
and that's the man I hired
to be my protege.

42:02.865 --> 42:04.232
How am I doing?

42:04.234 --> 42:06.802
Honestly?

42:06.804 --> 42:09.571
I couldn't be more proud.
