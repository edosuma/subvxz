00:03.969 --> 00:05.445
Free Bobby to ride free!

00:05.469 --> 00:09.161
Free Bobby to ride free!
Free Bobby to ride free!

00:09.185 --> 00:10.796
Free Bobby to ride free!

00:10.820 --> 00:12.932
- Who's Bobby?
- He's their president.

00:12.956 --> 00:14.033
He's on trial in there for running

00:14.057 --> 00:15.634
a meth lab out of his garage.

00:15.658 --> 00:17.937
Bobby's riding five to seven,
what Bobby's riding.

00:17.961 --> 00:19.805
Back behind your bikes, guys!

00:19.829 --> 00:21.106
...free! Free Bobby to ride...

00:21.130 --> 00:23.609
It's a free country, Porky!

00:23.633 --> 00:25.811
- Back behind your bikes now.
- We got a right

00:25.835 --> 00:28.314
- to be heard!
- Behind your bikes, you do.

00:28.338 --> 00:31.106
Free Bobby to ride free!
Free Bobby to ride free!

00:32.442 --> 00:34.019
Hey! Hey! Hey, what's going on?

00:38.348 --> 00:40.326
I'm an uncle. I'm an uncle.

00:40.350 --> 00:41.727
Walsh, behind you!

00:49.692 --> 00:51.397
Where is Officer Janko?!

00:51.422 --> 00:52.867
Excuse me, ma'am, we're a little busy.

00:52.891 --> 00:55.148
- Please take a seat.
- I need to speak to her now.

00:55.173 --> 00:57.204
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
ask you to calm down, please.

00:57.228 --> 01:00.508
I'm not going to calm down until
you bring me Officer Janko.

01:00.532 --> 01:02.308
She's not here now. Maybe
I can help you with something?

01:02.332 --> 01:05.340
Yeah. You could start by explaining

01:05.340 --> 01:07.343
why I got a doctor

01:07.367 --> 01:10.022
badgering me and calling my house

01:10.046 --> 01:12.291
after my car accident last week.

01:12.315 --> 01:14.156
I'm sorry, what does this
have to do with Officer Janko?

01:14.180 --> 01:15.928
I was in a single-car crash.

01:15.952 --> 01:17.396
- Uh-huh.
- She's the only person

01:17.420 --> 01:19.731
that knows about this accident
besides me,

01:19.755 --> 01:21.633
and she filed a damn report.

01:21.657 --> 01:23.313
- Did you go to the hospital?
- No.

01:23.337 --> 01:25.604
- File a claim?
- I didn't even tell my husband,

01:25.628 --> 01:27.139
'cause I knew he'd have a fit.

01:27.163 --> 01:29.515
Look, I'm-I'm sure
it's probably a coincidence.

01:29.539 --> 01:32.311
I've read about cops
selling accident reports

01:32.335 --> 01:34.246
- like this before.
- I think you might

01:34.270 --> 01:35.581
be getting ahead of yourself.

01:35.605 --> 01:37.216
Here's the information.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.851
Dr. Mehta.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.986
Janko must have tipped off the doctor,

01:41.010 --> 01:42.577
who knows who else?

01:44.180 --> 01:45.657
All right.

01:45.681 --> 01:49.294
And you were alone in the store
when the robbers entered?

01:49.318 --> 01:51.486
I'm-I'm always the first one in.

01:52.855 --> 01:54.831
I thought the front door was locked

01:54.855 --> 01:57.169
when I opened up the safe
and started taking inventory

01:57.193 --> 01:59.805
of the jewels, but he entered,

01:59.829 --> 02:03.342
pulled the gun, pointed
it right at my face.

02:03.366 --> 02:06.411
And did he push you or hit you?

02:06.435 --> 02:09.383
No. He just said...

02:09.771 --> 02:12.387
"Call the cops and you're dead."

02:12.842 --> 02:16.144
So I just stood there and
watched him empty out the safe.

02:17.380 --> 02:19.447
Well, you did the smart thing.

02:20.483 --> 02:22.361
Can he find me?

02:23.065 --> 02:24.563
What do you mean?

02:24.587 --> 02:26.465
I-I don't know how this works.

02:26.489 --> 02:28.233
Is a crime report public?

02:28.257 --> 02:29.952
My name as a witness?

02:29.977 --> 02:32.322
No. Police report is not made public.

02:32.347 --> 02:33.847
So he can't, right?

02:37.567 --> 02:39.311
Full disclosure.

02:39.335 --> 02:42.214
A new fairness law
went into effect recently.

02:42.238 --> 02:45.117
It requires us to hand over
witnesses' contact information

02:45.141 --> 02:47.119
to the defense attorneys.

02:47.143 --> 02:48.598
You mean, like my address?

02:48.622 --> 02:50.932
Well, yes, but just to the attorneys.

02:50.957 --> 02:52.668
How is that fairness?

02:52.982 --> 02:55.460
I mean, what about
the witnesses, the victims?

02:55.484 --> 02:57.396
How-How's that fair to us?

02:57.933 --> 03:00.699
Katie, Goodman is in Rikers
until the trial.

03:00.723 --> 03:03.188
There is nothing to worry about.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.910
Ms. Hodge?

03:11.934 --> 03:13.579
I was in the building,

03:13.603 --> 03:15.681
thought I'd save myself a trip later.

03:15.705 --> 03:17.049
Goodman case files?

03:17.073 --> 03:18.951
Yes. It's been 15 days.

03:18.975 --> 03:20.516
You're now required by law

03:20.540 --> 03:22.162
to give over the witnesses' information.

03:22.187 --> 03:24.723
Actually, the law says
15 days from arraignment,

03:24.747 --> 03:26.325
so I have two more hours.

03:26.349 --> 03:28.327
So you're one of those.

03:28.351 --> 03:29.595
One of what?

03:29.619 --> 03:32.497
I just think it's a sin
to waste a colleague's time.

03:33.010 --> 03:35.400
I am happy to save you a trip.

03:36.154 --> 03:37.669
Do me a favor?

03:37.693 --> 03:40.439
Treat this like the loaded weapon it is.

03:40.463 --> 03:42.507
Kind of an overstatement.

03:42.531 --> 03:44.376
Well, maybe.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.679
But your client is
a repeat violent offender.

03:47.703 --> 03:50.849
So yes, the new law says I have
to hand over the contacts.

03:50.873 --> 03:52.818
It does not say you need to download

03:52.842 --> 03:54.847
all the names and addresses to him.

03:55.144 --> 03:56.460
I will do whatever I see fit

03:56.484 --> 03:59.162
to make sure that my client
receives a fair trial.

03:59.186 --> 04:00.699
I am sure you will.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.932
You have a good day.

04:02.786 --> 04:04.787
I will certainly try.

04:07.293 --> 04:09.271
And at 10:30 you are
meeting with Chief Kimura

04:09.296 --> 04:10.673
to review her proposal

04:10.698 --> 04:13.173
on new mental health
training initiatives.

04:13.288 --> 04:14.469
At 11:00...

04:14.493 --> 04:16.002
Push back my 11:00.

04:16.026 --> 04:18.173
I'm gonna need more time with Kimura.

04:18.197 --> 04:20.406
All right. So 11:30?

04:20.430 --> 04:22.888
- Good.
- Great. So at 11:30

04:22.888 --> 04:25.073
you will meet
with Chief Fitzgerald about...

04:25.098 --> 04:28.300
Could it wait five minutes?
We are almost done.

04:28.324 --> 04:30.613
Actually, no, it can't.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.082
A lawsuit's just been filed
against the department

04:33.106 --> 04:35.734
claiming excessive force
was used during an arrest.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.169
So? We get those complaints all the time.

04:40.172 --> 04:42.550
The plaintiff is an NYPD detective

04:42.574 --> 04:45.476
who's been deep undercover
the last nine months.

04:48.352 --> 04:49.943
Our officer

04:49.967 --> 04:53.217
didn't know he was
taking down a fellow cop.

04:58.523 --> 04:59.834
What do we got?

04:59.858 --> 05:01.676
Vic is a white male in his 50s

05:01.676 --> 05:03.054
found this morning by a jogger.

05:03.078 --> 05:05.223
Wife, kids and the nanny were
asleep up their apartment.

05:05.247 --> 05:06.691
His name is Felix Roth.

05:06.715 --> 05:08.559
- Like the photographer?
- Beats me.

05:08.583 --> 05:11.295
His wife's upstairs... you can
ask her if he takes pictures.

05:11.319 --> 05:12.363
You think?

05:12.387 --> 05:13.698
We got it from here.

05:13.722 --> 05:15.500
Danny, this guy's been all over the news

05:15.524 --> 05:16.868
the past couple of weeks.

05:16.892 --> 05:18.603
- What'd he do?
- Well, more like

05:18.627 --> 05:19.737
what didn't he do?

05:19.761 --> 05:21.239
A ton of his former models

05:21.263 --> 05:22.807
came forward claiming sexual assault.

05:22.831 --> 05:24.509
It's up to, like, 20 now,

05:24.533 --> 05:27.868
- and counting. Real nasty stuff, too.
- Really?

05:28.904 --> 05:31.572
So 'twas beauty killed the beast.

05:58.087 --> 05:59.635
That's the wife, Allie Roth.

06:00.176 --> 06:01.554
All right, thanks.

06:02.225 --> 06:03.902
Mrs. Roth?

06:03.926 --> 06:05.319
Detective Reagan.

06:05.343 --> 06:07.092
This is my partner, Detective Baez.

06:07.093 --> 06:09.738
Wanted to offer our condolences.

06:09.762 --> 06:11.039
Thank you.

06:11.063 --> 06:12.607
I'm sure this has been
a very difficult time

06:12.631 --> 06:14.276
for your family already,.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.678
The past few weeks have been hell.

06:16.702 --> 06:18.814
When's the last time
you saw your husband?

06:18.838 --> 06:20.248
Three days ago.

06:20.272 --> 06:22.918
I asked him to stay at a hotel
until everything blew over.

06:22.942 --> 06:24.219
Any idea why he

06:24.243 --> 06:26.188
would come back here last night?

06:26.212 --> 06:27.823
Not a clue.

06:27.847 --> 06:30.859
I have no idea why he'd
be dropping by at that hour.

06:32.218 --> 06:34.029
Where are Thatcher and Everest?

06:34.053 --> 06:35.330
In the playroom.

06:35.354 --> 06:38.465
Detectives, this is our nanny, Melissa.

06:38.489 --> 06:40.869
If you don't mind,
I'd like to check on my kids.

06:40.893 --> 06:42.604
Of course.

06:42.628 --> 06:44.581
Uh, I'm Detective Reagan.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.112
This is my partner, Detective Baez.

06:46.136 --> 06:47.876
Would you mind if we
ask you a few questions?

06:47.900 --> 06:49.211
- Mm-hmm.
- How long have you worked

06:49.235 --> 06:50.345
for the Roths?

06:50.369 --> 06:52.885
- Um, about a year.
- Is there anything unusual

06:52.909 --> 06:55.050
- we should know about them?
- There's nothing usual

06:55.074 --> 06:56.184
about them.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.853
But Felix was a great father.

06:57.877 --> 06:59.387
He loved his children.

06:59.411 --> 07:01.089
Mm-hmm. Do you live here?

07:01.113 --> 07:03.058
No. I-I live with my dad in the Bronx.

07:03.082 --> 07:06.328
But I do stay over when I work
late and have to be in early.

07:06.352 --> 07:08.163
So you were here last night?

07:08.187 --> 07:10.260
- I was.
- Did you see

07:10.284 --> 07:12.934
or hear anyone enter
or leave the apartment?

07:12.958 --> 07:15.370
No. Uh, Mrs. Roth went to bed before me,

07:15.394 --> 07:16.505
and I didn't hear anything

07:16.529 --> 07:18.173
until the doorman came in with the news.

07:18.197 --> 07:21.743
Any chance Mrs. Roth might have
been involved in this?

07:21.767 --> 07:23.707
God, no. Of course not.

07:23.731 --> 07:25.213
I... I mean, they had their issues,

07:25.237 --> 07:26.481
but she loved him.

07:26.505 --> 07:27.816
She could never.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.921
Did you ever see Mr. Roth
bring another woman back here?

07:30.945 --> 07:33.131
No. He wasn't sneaking around.

07:33.155 --> 07:35.457
But you have heard the accusations?

07:35.481 --> 07:36.758
You mean the lies?

07:36.782 --> 07:38.894
He wasn't that kind of man.

07:38.918 --> 07:41.530
Okay? He... he was a lot of things,

07:41.554 --> 07:44.055
but he wasn't the monster
they made him out to be.

07:50.162 --> 07:52.607
Hey, Sarge. Heard you wanted to see me.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.076
Do you remember a woman
by the name of Donna Davis?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.279
You wrote an accident report
for her last week.

07:57.303 --> 07:58.795
Oh, yeah, how could I forget?

07:58.819 --> 08:01.616
She was a hot mess. She
ran a car into a stop sign.

08:01.640 --> 08:02.918
Who does that?

08:02.942 --> 08:04.853
So you...

08:04.877 --> 08:06.388
completed that report?

08:06.412 --> 08:08.590
Yeah. I was... I was riding with Long,

08:08.614 --> 08:10.959
but... I completed the report.

08:10.983 --> 08:12.661
You have any idea
how that accident report

08:12.685 --> 08:14.429
could have ended up in the hands

08:14.453 --> 08:16.665
of some ambulance chaser named Dr. Mehta?

08:16.689 --> 08:18.700
- Wait. What?
- Or do you think

08:18.724 --> 08:21.303
that Long could have sold it
or shared it?

08:21.327 --> 08:23.071
Long? No.

08:23.095 --> 08:24.951
No chance he could've let it
slip into the wrong hands?

08:24.975 --> 08:28.506
No, there's no way.
What is with the third degree?

08:28.530 --> 08:30.745
I hate to say it,
but your partners since me

08:30.769 --> 08:33.081
haven't exactly had
the best track record.

08:33.105 --> 08:34.514
First it was Maya, then Troy...

08:34.514 --> 08:35.491
It's like it's becoming a pattern.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.784
Okay, well, here's a pattern.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.369
Once a report has been processed,

08:39.393 --> 08:42.346
every officer in this precinct
has access to it.

08:42.371 --> 08:44.249
Okay, we'll have to start by following up

08:44.274 --> 08:45.637
with the officer who wrote it.

08:45.661 --> 08:48.020
Wait, you're no longer my sergeant...
You should have given this

08:48.044 --> 08:50.303
- to McNichols to look into.
- If I gave it to McNichols,

08:50.327 --> 08:52.240
she would send it right over
to IAB, as per protocol.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.317
I'm trying to help you out

08:53.341 --> 08:54.496
by getting to the bottom of this.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.554
Well, I don't need your help.
I haven't done anything wrong.

08:59.848 --> 09:01.325
<i>Detective Alex Porter</i>

09:01.349 --> 09:04.028
filed the suit, but he
won't pop as a cop.

09:04.052 --> 09:06.230
- How come?
- He used his undercover name.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.756
- So, one good thing.
- Two good things.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.602
Porter's been embedded for nine months

09:11.626 --> 09:14.405
with the Satan's Bishops motorcycle gang.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.706
They hate cops.

09:15.730 --> 09:17.041
And how is that a good thing?

09:17.065 --> 09:19.809
Means he probably started
the fight and escalated it...

09:19.809 --> 09:21.620
Another layer of his cover.

09:21.644 --> 09:25.057
And filing a lawsuit for damages
was also part of the play.

09:25.081 --> 09:27.119
Please walk me through the allegations.

09:27.143 --> 09:29.628
Porter was part of a protest
outside the courthouse

09:29.652 --> 09:31.697
where the club's president is being tried

09:31.721 --> 09:33.599
on drugs and weapons charges.

09:33.623 --> 09:35.167
Conner and the cops stepped in...

09:35.191 --> 09:37.369
Conner's a first-rate cop, boss.

09:37.393 --> 09:39.638
...when the gang
advanced on the courthouse.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.739
Fights broke out.

09:40.763 --> 09:42.099
Body cams.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.276
Conner was working the detail in uniform,

09:44.300 --> 09:47.045
but he's a detective assigned
to the 3-6 squad.

09:47.069 --> 09:48.639
So he's not required to wear a body cam.

09:48.663 --> 09:49.748
Exactly.

09:49.772 --> 09:50.883
Cell phone video.

09:50.907 --> 09:52.151
None that have surfaced.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.153
Well, there's one out there.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.988
There always is, so find it.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.158
Because we shouldn't
talk to our undercover.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.276
It's not worth the risk.

10:01.884 --> 10:05.280
Well... I'm afraid
that's gonna be my decision.

10:06.255 --> 10:09.723
I'm just saying these bikers
watch each other like hawks.

10:09.808 --> 10:12.471
Their main business
is running illegal firearms

10:12.495 --> 10:13.739
up here from down south.

10:13.763 --> 10:15.440
- I know that.
- There's no loyalty

10:15.464 --> 10:17.509
to a cause, a movement, a religion.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.678
Just a bunch of mercenaries and pirates.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.013
Nobody trusts anybody
despite all the blood oaths

10:22.038 --> 10:23.039
and sacred bonds.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.450
I know that, too.

10:24.853 --> 10:26.776
I saw this documentary.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.546
Let me talk to Conner.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.825
So he can tell you how innocent he is

10:31.849 --> 10:33.259
and you can tell me?

10:33.283 --> 10:35.482
I'm afraid that's only half the story.

10:35.506 --> 10:37.487
Boss, I know Conner. He's a good cop.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.657
Let me get a read. That's my job.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.559
No, that's procedure.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.228
The job is to get a read,
and if it's squirrelly,

10:44.252 --> 10:46.264
report that fact back to me.

10:46.288 --> 10:48.289
Copy that, boss.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.474
Well, it's about time.

10:56.498 --> 10:57.448
I was with Chatwal.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.975
Why's it always got to be you
that stands up to the D.A.?

10:59.999 --> 11:02.037
I don't know.
I guess all of my colleagues

11:02.061 --> 11:04.589
care about the future of their jobs.

11:05.097 --> 11:06.733
And what was your angle?

11:08.259 --> 11:09.945
That you can't have

11:09.969 --> 11:12.180
huge policy changes

11:12.204 --> 11:14.516
without being prepared
on the retail level.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.384
I mean, it's our fault we're not ready,

11:16.408 --> 11:18.424
and the cracks are starting to show.

11:18.448 --> 11:21.056
And when you say our fault,
you mean his fault?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.857
Implied.

11:22.881 --> 11:24.859
But he's not willing to do anything

11:24.883 --> 11:26.628
that might indicate that...

11:26.652 --> 11:28.997
the new laws are anything but perfect.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.599
So we all got to suffer
because of this guy's ego?

11:31.623 --> 11:34.169
Yes, and his reelection chances,

11:34.193 --> 11:35.927
- of course.
- Damn it.

11:35.951 --> 11:37.072
What?

11:37.096 --> 11:38.073
Katie Gray's on her way

11:38.097 --> 11:39.708
to St. Benjamin in an ambulance.

11:39.732 --> 11:41.733
Let's go.

11:45.257 --> 11:47.602
And when I reached down for my keys...

11:47.627 --> 11:50.061
I felt someone behind me.

11:51.397 --> 11:54.232
He shoved me up against the door.

11:56.435 --> 11:58.436
Hit me in my face.

12:01.674 --> 12:03.452
And he threw me on the ground.

12:03.476 --> 12:05.887
We're gonna find whoever did this.

12:05.911 --> 12:07.712
Not with my help.

12:09.181 --> 12:10.826
You told me not to worry.

12:10.850 --> 12:12.728
Now look at me.

12:12.752 --> 12:14.096
I understand...

12:14.678 --> 12:16.331
why you feel that way.

12:16.355 --> 12:19.064
But this robbery doesn't
necessarily connect to Goodman.

12:19.088 --> 12:21.103
Okay, you got proof?

12:21.127 --> 12:22.648
No.

12:22.672 --> 12:24.646
Then please, just leave.

12:32.404 --> 12:34.655
Let's just give her
some time to calm down.

12:34.679 --> 12:36.451
She's right not to trust me.

12:36.475 --> 12:38.268
Yeah, but you're not
the one that hurt her.

12:38.292 --> 12:40.155
Are you the assigned A.D.A.?

12:40.179 --> 12:42.291
Uh, no, she's a witness in another case.

12:42.315 --> 12:43.525
Did you bring her in?

12:43.549 --> 12:45.000
I was the first on the scene.

12:45.001 --> 12:47.152
And it matches a string of robberies

12:47.176 --> 12:48.253
in her neighborhood and...

12:48.277 --> 12:49.587
And then beaten up?

12:49.611 --> 12:52.090
No, just the purses with the others.

12:52.114 --> 12:53.858
So it's not really a match.

12:53.882 --> 12:55.026
Well, not...

12:55.050 --> 12:56.427
exactly, no.

12:56.451 --> 12:58.897
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

12:59.806 --> 13:02.433
This was a loud and clear
warning not to testify.

13:02.457 --> 13:05.436
Yeah, but Marcus Goodman
is still at Rikers.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.397
So, he outsourced it.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.609
Look, we owe it
to the rest of the witnesses

13:11.633 --> 13:13.478
on that list to keep them safe.

13:14.174 --> 13:15.875
I agree.

13:17.472 --> 13:19.150
Did you know
that Roth's wife Allie

13:19.174 --> 13:20.318
was a model, too?

13:20.342 --> 13:22.921
Yeah, it says here she was
one of his first muses.

13:22.945 --> 13:24.355
Yeah, well, it says in this interview

13:24.379 --> 13:26.090
that they had sex the day they met.

13:26.114 --> 13:27.492
During a photo shoot.

13:27.516 --> 13:28.793
Right on the studio floor.

13:28.817 --> 13:31.038
Soho in the '80s. Times were different.

13:31.062 --> 13:33.097
Thanks, Debbie Harry.
The point I'm trying to make is,

13:33.121 --> 13:35.033
that's the same exact move

13:35.057 --> 13:37.770
that all these young women
are accusing him of now.

13:37.794 --> 13:39.504
The move he made on his
wife back in the day.

13:39.528 --> 13:40.538
So?

13:40.562 --> 13:41.940
So, if he liked them young

13:41.964 --> 13:43.274
back when he met his wife,

13:43.298 --> 13:45.143
maybe he still likes them young.

13:45.167 --> 13:47.378
And she got sick of being
traded in for newer models,

13:47.402 --> 13:48.780
and finally snapped.

13:48.804 --> 13:50.181
Yes.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.482
I've heard of weaker motives.

13:51.506 --> 13:53.418
Think she's done grieving?

13:53.442 --> 13:55.209
Let's go find out.

13:58.778 --> 14:00.030
<i>I was new to the city,</i>

14:00.054 --> 14:03.500
I was broke,
and he made me an overnight success.

14:03.524 --> 14:04.734
He gave me my life.

14:04.758 --> 14:06.836
Yeah, how did it feel
to watch him continue

14:06.860 --> 14:09.362
to do that to younger girls
year after year?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.744
I didn't watch.

14:14.768 --> 14:16.546
We didn't talk about it.

14:16.570 --> 14:18.214
But, yeah, I knew.

14:18.238 --> 14:19.983
That's why I wanted out.

14:20.007 --> 14:22.318
And that's why you murdered your husband?

14:23.477 --> 14:24.564
Seriously?

14:24.588 --> 14:25.624
Dead serious.

14:25.648 --> 14:27.991
God, no. No, that's...

14:28.015 --> 14:30.193
that's why I brought the models he abused

14:30.217 --> 14:32.418
to the reporter who broke the story.

14:33.687 --> 14:34.931
What are you talking about?

14:34.955 --> 14:36.199
I'd never see our kids again

14:36.223 --> 14:37.500
if I filed for divorce.

14:37.524 --> 14:38.758
What makes you say that?

14:40.307 --> 14:43.219
Felix is famous and powerful

14:43.244 --> 14:44.873
and highly functional.

14:44.898 --> 14:47.911
And I'm washed up and under
treatment for depression.

14:47.935 --> 14:50.113
So he would've gotten
custody, no doubt about it.

14:50.137 --> 14:51.848
Even my lawyer said so.

14:51.872 --> 14:53.116
Okay, so let me get this straight.

14:53.140 --> 14:55.085
You're telling us that you purposely

14:55.109 --> 14:58.088
orchestrated your husband's downfall?

14:58.112 --> 15:00.390
It's easy math, Detectives.

15:00.414 --> 15:03.927
No more Felix,
no more Felix-signed prints.

15:03.951 --> 15:06.229
Yes, I killed his reputation.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.515
But I did not kill my husband.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.468
She's holding out on something.

15:11.492 --> 15:13.336
Well, according to the nanny, she was

15:13.360 --> 15:15.038
in the apartment the entire time.

15:15.062 --> 15:17.307
Okay, well, where's the nanny today?

15:17.331 --> 15:18.975
Could be her day off?

15:18.999 --> 15:20.810
Well it's not <i>our</i> day off.

15:20.834 --> 15:22.746
I say we lean in on the nanny.

15:22.770 --> 15:25.749
Find out what she really
thinks of her dear family

15:25.773 --> 15:27.774
and beloved boss.

15:32.171 --> 15:33.890
That's what they got you doing, Sid...

15:33.914 --> 15:36.359
Retail interviews on civilian complaints?

15:36.383 --> 15:37.594
Just when they pop.

15:37.618 --> 15:38.928
How'd this pop?

15:38.952 --> 15:40.063
How about I ask the questions?

15:40.087 --> 15:41.164
Shoot.

15:41.188 --> 15:42.298
Chain of events.

15:42.322 --> 15:44.033
These Satan's Bishops guys

15:44.057 --> 15:45.301
were advancing on the courthouse.

15:45.325 --> 15:47.552
We were under orders to
keep them at the curb.

15:47.576 --> 15:49.611
We ordered them back, they kept going.

15:49.635 --> 15:51.377
- Who laid hands first?
- The biker.

15:51.401 --> 15:53.654
- And you did what?
- Pushed him away.

15:53.678 --> 15:55.378
He kept coming, so I took him down.

15:55.402 --> 15:57.135
- Choke hold?
- No.

15:57.159 --> 16:00.350
- Choke hold light?
- I got a grip.

16:00.374 --> 16:02.318
For, like, five seconds.

16:02.342 --> 16:04.120
He was pretty greasy...
You've seen these guys.

16:04.144 --> 16:05.255
Hard to get a handle on them.

16:05.279 --> 16:07.690
- Uh-huh.
- It's all about money.

16:07.714 --> 16:10.305
The way the city pays out,
it's like cops are ATMs.

16:10.329 --> 16:11.694
Burns my ass, too.

16:11.718 --> 16:12.796
So you know what I'm saying.

16:12.820 --> 16:13.830
Loud and clear.

16:13.854 --> 16:15.265
- But here's the thing.
- Hmm?

16:15.289 --> 16:18.434
Is there any chance you might've
been a little too aggressive?

16:18.751 --> 16:20.770
I know I acted fairly.

16:20.794 --> 16:22.639
And besides, you've seen these guys,

16:22.663 --> 16:24.474
these bikers... They're dirt bags.

16:24.498 --> 16:25.809
Can't affect how you treat them.

16:25.833 --> 16:27.010
I know that.

16:27.260 --> 16:28.711
It was all clean.

16:28.735 --> 16:30.146
- Mm-hmm.
- By the book.

16:30.170 --> 16:32.215
And every other guy on the scene
will attest to that.

16:32.239 --> 16:33.783
They got my back.

16:33.807 --> 16:36.486
Uh-huh, they got your back.

16:36.510 --> 16:38.154
Or...

16:38.771 --> 16:40.590
they're hiding the truth.

16:40.940 --> 16:42.592
You have any more questions,

16:42.616 --> 16:44.656
I'll see you with a union rep present.

16:44.680 --> 16:45.970
All right, fair enough.

16:45.994 --> 16:47.463
What the hell happened to you, Sid?

16:47.487 --> 16:49.488
You used to be one of us.

16:54.194 --> 16:55.438
Hey, Long.

16:55.462 --> 16:56.840
What's up, Sarge?

16:56.864 --> 16:59.375
Ask you something? Have you
ever been to a Dr. Mehta?

16:59.399 --> 17:01.578
Yeah. You looking for a new doc?

17:01.602 --> 17:02.979
Just curious.

17:03.003 --> 17:04.814
Well, he's a great guy.

17:04.838 --> 17:06.816
Been helping cops and
their families for years.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.251
Doesn't matter if the stuff is covered.

17:08.275 --> 17:10.252
He's never turned away a boy in blue.

17:10.277 --> 17:11.887
Ah, so, you recommend him?

17:11.912 --> 17:13.623
You bet your ass I would.

17:13.646 --> 17:15.959
Plus, he's been struggling lately.

17:15.983 --> 17:17.809
All these fancy new
urgent cares popping up

17:17.833 --> 17:19.462
all over the city... it's
tough for an old school

17:19.486 --> 17:21.263
GP like him to keep afloat.

17:21.288 --> 17:23.599
That why you've been
feeding him accident reports?

17:23.624 --> 17:25.101
Excuse me?

17:25.125 --> 17:27.069
It's been going on, and you
just laid out a perfect reason

17:27.094 --> 17:28.671
why a good guy might
do something like that.

17:28.988 --> 17:30.733
Hey, boss...

17:30.837 --> 17:32.548
just move along?

17:32.985 --> 17:34.986
Is that a threat?

17:35.369 --> 17:38.004
There's nothing to see here, I promise.

17:40.674 --> 17:41.985
<i>You know, there's still</i>

17:42.009 --> 17:44.954
no proof that Katie's
assault was tied to Marcus.

17:44.978 --> 17:46.692
This isn't on you.

17:46.716 --> 17:50.460
I know, just find Ms. Stewart,
offer her protection.

17:50.484 --> 17:52.996
Just play it safe until we know more.

17:53.020 --> 17:55.698
You're not gonna be able to
protect every witness like this.

17:55.722 --> 17:57.867
Why? There's only five of them.

17:57.891 --> 18:01.070
Yeah, I mean, as this problem grows.

18:01.094 --> 18:04.774
Asking cops to watch out
for witnesses and victims

18:04.798 --> 18:07.543
of every case that
this office is prosecuting

18:07.567 --> 18:10.346
is completely unrealistic.

18:10.370 --> 18:13.917
Chatwal is not gonna ask for
special help from One PP.

18:13.941 --> 18:15.190
You know 'cause you asked?

18:15.214 --> 18:17.877
Yeah, and he tore me up.

18:20.814 --> 18:23.340
I can see why she likes
staying over at the Roths.

18:23.364 --> 18:25.336
Yeah, me, too.

18:28.422 --> 18:31.357
Melissa, it's Detective
Reagan and Baez. Open up.

18:35.996 --> 18:37.974
Melissa isn't home.

18:37.998 --> 18:39.409
You're her father?

18:39.433 --> 18:40.910
Hector Rodriguez.

18:40.934 --> 18:42.078
Do you mind if we come in

18:42.102 --> 18:43.947
just for a minute,
ask you a few questions?

18:43.971 --> 18:45.214
Yes, please.

18:45.238 --> 18:46.272
Thank you.

18:49.609 --> 18:51.020
Thanks.

18:51.044 --> 18:52.757
That's a beautiful statue.

18:52.781 --> 18:54.540
Reminds me of my mother's.

18:54.565 --> 18:56.209
That was passed down
to me from my mother.

18:56.234 --> 18:57.645
Oh, yeah? Where you from?

18:58.061 --> 19:00.530
- Monte Cristi.
- Dominican Republic?

19:00.554 --> 19:02.265
Melissa was born here, though.

19:02.289 --> 19:03.766
- I have the papers.
- That's okay.

19:03.790 --> 19:06.803
We're not worried about
her immigration status.

19:06.827 --> 19:09.539
We're more interested in her former boss.

19:09.563 --> 19:10.796
Felix Roth?

19:12.099 --> 19:14.544
I never approved
of her work for that man.

19:14.568 --> 19:16.612
- Why not?
- The money she earned

19:16.636 --> 19:18.081
was coming directly from sales

19:18.105 --> 19:20.083
of his sinful photos.

19:20.107 --> 19:22.352
I told her she wasn't allowed to go back

19:22.376 --> 19:23.619
and must quit.

19:23.643 --> 19:25.803
Well, she didn't quit, did she?

19:25.827 --> 19:27.070
No.

19:27.094 --> 19:28.825
She disobeyed me, went back to work,

19:28.849 --> 19:31.490
and now she's mixed up
in this murder investigation.

19:31.490 --> 19:33.402
- Right.
- Have you noticed anything

19:33.426 --> 19:35.003
off about her recently?

19:35.027 --> 19:36.505
She acting any differently?

19:36.991 --> 19:39.274
I barely recognize her anymore.

19:39.298 --> 19:40.509
Do you know where she is?

19:40.533 --> 19:41.743
We had a fight.

19:41.767 --> 19:43.013
She took off.

19:43.037 --> 19:44.903
What did you two fight about?

19:46.138 --> 19:48.617
She told me she was pregnant.

19:48.641 --> 19:51.338
Does she have a boyfriend?

19:53.179 --> 19:54.890
What's it matter?

19:54.914 --> 19:56.892
She said she wanted to get rid of it.

19:56.916 --> 19:58.627
My grandchild.

19:58.651 --> 20:00.362
Do you know where she went

20:00.386 --> 20:01.830
after you two had a fight?

20:02.308 --> 20:05.757
I've been calling her
but she won't answer.

20:09.537 --> 20:10.873
Melissa was calling and texting

20:10.897 --> 20:14.076
a number registered to
Felix Roth Studios all hours.

20:14.445 --> 20:15.811
Felix had a second number?

20:15.835 --> 20:16.812
Yep.

20:16.836 --> 20:19.314
- His business.
- Mm-hmm.

20:19.338 --> 20:23.018
So maybe Melissa was
more than just his nanny.

20:23.496 --> 20:25.120
Explains why she defended him.

20:25.144 --> 20:26.955
Also explains something else.

20:26.979 --> 20:28.257
What?

20:28.281 --> 20:29.858
She's pregnant.

20:30.181 --> 20:32.382
What if Felix is the father?

20:33.786 --> 20:35.597
Explains why Mrs. Roth

20:35.621 --> 20:37.299
would have been angry enough to kill him.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.268
Yeah. Now we just have to explain

20:39.292 --> 20:41.169
why Mrs. Roth sent Melissa

20:41.193 --> 20:43.205
a $10,000 Venmo payment.

20:43.724 --> 20:46.431
Uh, maybe a very generous
Christmas bonus?

20:47.466 --> 20:49.211
At the end of January?

20:49.235 --> 20:51.980
Well, what do you think it is,
hush money?

20:52.004 --> 20:54.527
There's only way to find out.

20:55.174 --> 20:56.451
Forget Conner's a cop.

20:56.475 --> 20:57.686
Think of him as a perp.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.321
You still buying the whole hog?

20:59.782 --> 21:00.979
Yes.

21:02.114 --> 21:03.392
The whole hog?

21:03.416 --> 21:05.627
I don't think what happened
rises to the level

21:05.651 --> 21:07.362
of a complaint and a payout.

21:07.386 --> 21:08.497
Payout?

21:08.521 --> 21:10.866
- Yeah.
- Policy on settling complaints

21:10.890 --> 21:12.801
is not in your purview. Clear?

21:12.825 --> 21:14.169
- Yes.
- Nor is being

21:14.193 --> 21:16.805
the rank and file's favorite uncle.

21:16.829 --> 21:18.473
Well, those days are gone.

21:18.497 --> 21:21.176
Give me a break. You bucking
to be back in a precinct?

21:21.200 --> 21:23.134
- No.
- Then cut it out.

21:26.772 --> 21:29.985
My account of the conversation
would be that Detective Conner

21:30.009 --> 21:31.987
used appropriate force.

21:32.011 --> 21:34.656
Okay? He framed his recounting
in a way that might help

21:34.680 --> 21:36.358
keep his balls out of the wringer,

21:36.405 --> 21:39.440
which is insurance
any smart cop would take out.

21:40.453 --> 21:41.730
Come in.

21:41.754 --> 21:44.366
I just got word
that two more citizens arrested

21:44.390 --> 21:46.868
at that protest filed similar complaints.

21:46.892 --> 21:48.770
"Citizens"? You know
what those guys call themselves?

21:48.794 --> 21:51.473
Satan's Bishops!
Don't give me "citizens."

21:51.497 --> 21:53.231
Porter's a cop!

21:56.230 --> 21:58.613
I would remind you
that the first complaint

21:58.637 --> 22:00.801
came from one of our own.

22:03.602 --> 22:05.389
Yes, sir.

22:09.184 --> 22:11.616
Anything I can do?

22:13.564 --> 22:14.796
Yeah.

22:14.820 --> 22:16.988
Can you do the impossible?

22:25.156 --> 22:26.596
I can have this ready
for you in five minutes.

22:26.621 --> 22:27.680
- Hey.
- Yeah. Perfect.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.391
Hey. Uh, I'm glad I caught you.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.927
Did you talk to Long?

22:31.137 --> 22:33.746
Yeah. He said there's nothing to see.

22:33.747 --> 22:35.192
Jamie, I really think
that you should just drop

22:35.217 --> 22:36.747
- this whole thing.
- Which is a lot different

22:36.772 --> 22:38.857
than saying I know nothing about this.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.301
I got to take this to IAB.

22:40.325 --> 22:41.503
No, you don't.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.837
Yeah, of course I do.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.839
Jamie, this is a lot
bigger than you think.

22:45.864 --> 22:46.508
Okay.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.009
What does... what does that mean?

22:48.033 --> 22:50.612
Multiple cops, multiple precincts.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.347
All feeding this guy reports?

22:52.371 --> 22:53.681
That's what I'm hearing.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.216
- Then I got to do something.
- No.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.417
You got to get to the bottom of it.

22:56.441 --> 22:57.852
That's what you got to do.

22:57.876 --> 23:01.289
These guys are passing out
people's private information.

23:01.313 --> 23:02.457
They are breaking the law.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.993
Do you ever consider how this affects me?

23:05.569 --> 23:06.861
What are you talking about?

23:06.885 --> 23:08.763
All these guys,
they think that I'm a rat,

23:08.787 --> 23:11.332
and I'm coming in and running
and I'm tattling to the boss.

23:11.356 --> 23:13.835
That is not what I meant to happen.

23:13.859 --> 23:15.455
Then handle it.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.072
There's dinner in the fridge.

23:18.499 --> 23:19.774
You cooked?

23:19.798 --> 23:21.176
It tastes a lot like the taco truck

23:21.200 --> 23:22.767
from up the street.

23:33.979 --> 23:37.492
You ever feel like you woke up
in an alternate universe?

23:37.516 --> 23:39.794
Like a, um, like an Opposite Day?

23:39.818 --> 23:42.497
No, more like an Opposite World.

23:42.521 --> 23:44.165
Where it's like what?

23:44.189 --> 23:45.500
Where it's like the one person

23:45.524 --> 23:46.835
in this murder case

23:46.859 --> 23:49.704
who liked the victim, who
actually stood up for the victim

23:49.728 --> 23:51.206
is suddenly nowhere to be found.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.808
But all the likely suspects
are everywhere to be found?

23:53.832 --> 23:57.328
Exactly. The betrayed wife,
the young women

23:57.353 --> 23:59.223
he's accused of assaulting
throughout the years,

23:59.247 --> 24:00.658
they're all ready, willing

24:00.682 --> 24:02.775
and able to cooperate 24/7.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.452
I got one of my cops

24:04.476 --> 24:07.188
accusing another of my
cops of excessive force.

24:07.212 --> 24:09.491
I guess that's an Opposite World.

24:09.515 --> 24:12.316
The cop got a beef
with the cop they're accusing?

24:13.971 --> 24:17.455
Well... it's, uh, complicated.

24:19.471 --> 24:21.136
Oh. Well, who do you believe?

24:21.160 --> 24:24.372
Okay. I mean, here's the thing.

24:24.396 --> 24:25.874
In my usual world,

24:25.898 --> 24:28.877
I could just lean in on
the officer's account.

24:28.901 --> 24:29.978
I know their training.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.213
I know the oath that they take.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.015
Hell, I recited it to most of them.

24:34.039 --> 24:37.886
But in this case,
they're both my officers.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.688
Hmm.
I guess that's Opposite World.

24:40.712 --> 24:41.823
There you go.

24:41.847 --> 24:43.925
I think you might be onto something here.

24:43.949 --> 24:45.360
Wow. If you agree with me,

24:45.384 --> 24:47.429
- then I know it must be Opposite World.
- No.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.798
I'm trying to wrap my head around why

24:49.822 --> 24:51.833
I'm now required by law

24:51.857 --> 24:54.135
to hand over the witnesses' names,

24:54.159 --> 24:55.737
addresses, everything

24:55.769 --> 24:57.513
to the attorney for the defendant.

24:57.891 --> 24:59.063
As in the attorney

24:59.087 --> 25:00.975
- can share it with the defendant?
- It's like,

25:00.999 --> 25:02.710
just, "Here it is. Here's everyone

25:02.734 --> 25:04.813
"that is going to testify against you

25:04.837 --> 25:06.047
and how to get ahold of 'em."

25:06.071 --> 25:07.414
It's like I woke up in...

25:07.438 --> 25:08.947
Telling you, it's a real thing.

25:08.971 --> 25:10.919
Now you guys got me thinking like this.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.272
- How's that?
- I got these cops that I think

25:13.296 --> 25:16.524
are sidelining as shills for
a doc-in-a-box in our precinct,

25:16.548 --> 25:18.560
and I haven't sent it up to IAB yet.

25:19.036 --> 25:20.495
You didn't hear that.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.796
Hey, hear what?

25:21.820 --> 25:24.099
Because something tells me

25:24.123 --> 25:26.067
that maybe things aren't what they seem.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.346
In Opposite World.

25:27.370 --> 25:29.370
- Opposite World.
- That's right.

25:29.394 --> 25:30.505
Opposite World.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.864
Telling you.

25:39.438 --> 25:41.405
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.764
I'm not gonna do this again.

25:56.788 --> 25:58.233
Do what?

25:58.257 --> 26:00.135
I know that look.

26:02.538 --> 26:05.124
Yes, I need your help.

26:11.158 --> 26:12.781
And there it is.

26:14.539 --> 26:16.750
Call Baker and make an appointment.

26:16.775 --> 26:18.941
I'd like to keep this off the books.

26:18.965 --> 26:21.956
And I would rather keep a
separation of church and state

26:21.980 --> 26:23.559
between you and me.

26:26.437 --> 26:29.264
Our witnesses and victims are at risk

26:29.288 --> 26:31.055
with this new disclosure law.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.788
Laws I had no hand in writing.

26:34.812 --> 26:36.337
You didn't write 'em, any of 'em,

26:36.361 --> 26:38.373
but you do uphold them.

26:40.075 --> 26:42.043
Why are you carrying
Chatwal's water again?

26:42.067 --> 26:44.712
Look, he is not going to ask
for extra protection

26:44.736 --> 26:46.614
because he thinks it will reflect poorly

26:46.638 --> 26:49.417
on the criminal justice reform
that he championed.

26:49.794 --> 26:51.653
And he'd be right.

26:51.677 --> 26:53.655
My fight

26:54.131 --> 26:57.325
is for the innocent people at risk,

26:57.349 --> 26:59.717
and I need your help.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.265
Erin, I will do everything I can

27:04.289 --> 27:06.467
to keep those people safe.

27:06.491 --> 27:08.303
But your office needs

27:08.327 --> 27:10.939
to work out flaws in your system.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.275
Your office.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.988
Not mine.

27:29.709 --> 27:31.226
How was the tour?

27:31.250 --> 27:33.228
Another day at the office.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.562
Uneventful, huh?

27:34.586 --> 27:36.297
- Just the way you like it?
- Look,

27:36.321 --> 27:38.632
I know you think
you got to turn this over.

27:38.656 --> 27:39.834
I get it.

27:39.858 --> 27:42.827
- But just do me one favor, okay?
- What's that?

27:45.103 --> 27:47.404
Come meet me here at
the end of your tour.

27:50.202 --> 27:53.214
You want me to wait to make
the notification to IAB?

27:53.238 --> 27:55.883
Please, boss. I'm not a bad guy.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.619
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

27:57.643 --> 27:59.120
Just trust me, okay?

27:59.144 --> 28:00.688
One condition.

28:00.712 --> 28:01.818
Anything.

28:01.842 --> 28:03.424
You lay off Eddie and spread the word.

28:03.448 --> 28:05.216
She had nothing to do with this.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.210
Someone's at the door.

28:37.651 --> 28:38.860
Henry.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.129
<i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> author.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.397
Starts with a "T."

28:42.421 --> 28:43.821
T.E. Lawrence.

28:45.910 --> 28:47.358
Thanks.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.599
So, how are you doing, Detective?

28:56.635 --> 28:58.346
Okay.

28:58.563 --> 29:00.264
Except for this.

29:01.467 --> 29:02.917
Want to sit down?

29:03.477 --> 29:04.950
Sure.

29:07.212 --> 29:08.682
Coffee?

29:10.643 --> 29:13.294
So, you got a problem with this meeting.

29:13.318 --> 29:14.396
Yeah.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.621
Yes... sir.

29:19.057 --> 29:20.994
Okay. If you were me,
what would you have done?

29:21.018 --> 29:23.638
Taken my word I was the victim
of excessive force

29:23.662 --> 29:25.247
by an NYPD officer.

29:25.271 --> 29:28.176
- A fellow detective.
- Yes,

29:28.200 --> 29:29.577
which makes it even worse.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.113
The higher up you rise,
the more you should know better.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.615
We do take you at your word.

29:34.639 --> 29:36.507
Then why the off-campus get-together?

29:37.609 --> 29:40.922
Part of my job is to protect your cover.

29:40.946 --> 29:44.343
But as you know, we do
have to get both sides.

29:46.051 --> 29:49.330
And his side was... Let me guess...

29:49.354 --> 29:52.351
Appropriate action
under the circumstances.

29:52.758 --> 29:54.964
- That's about it.
- That being

29:54.988 --> 29:57.171
his full weight on his knee in my kidney

29:57.195 --> 29:59.073
and then his knee in my crotch,

29:59.097 --> 30:01.809
with his mitt on my windpipe

30:01.833 --> 30:04.802
and a kick to the head for dessert.

30:12.377 --> 30:15.323
And it is your belief you sustained that

30:15.347 --> 30:17.592
in your action with Detective Conner?

30:18.002 --> 30:20.284
Yes, sir, that's my belief.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.969
Okay, who put hands on first?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.513
I did.

30:30.598 --> 30:32.140
I'm playing a role.

30:32.164 --> 30:35.443
I need to be convincing in that role.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.678
I tried to tell him I was undercover.

30:37.702 --> 30:40.014
I said it right to him. "I'm an uncle."

30:40.038 --> 30:41.516
You sure he heard you?

30:41.540 --> 30:42.850
Honestly, it...

30:42.874 --> 30:44.852
it might have come out
a little messed up,

30:44.876 --> 30:47.054
what with the choke hold he had on me.

30:47.078 --> 30:48.289
So no.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.914
But that doesn't clear him.

30:51.082 --> 30:54.328
Why not let someone
else file a complaint?

30:54.352 --> 30:57.064
Why is it you who goes the extra mile?

30:57.088 --> 30:58.566
Come on.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.836
Bunch of outlaw bikers crying
"that cop roughed me up"?

31:01.860 --> 31:04.172
How seriously do you think
that would land?

31:04.196 --> 31:06.674
You sent me undercover

31:06.698 --> 31:08.009
to root out some bad guys.

31:08.048 --> 31:11.717
You didn't say only these bad guys.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.216
If I see the guns they run
up here getting delivered

31:15.240 --> 31:17.185
to the Convent of the Sacred Heart,

31:17.209 --> 31:19.654
I'm giving up the nuns.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.789
Same as this cop.

31:22.119 --> 31:23.987
That's how I see the job.

31:29.588 --> 31:32.533
Here's some cell phone video
that caught my arrest.

31:33.303 --> 31:36.272
You're welcome
for me not making it public.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.306
This it?

31:56.330 --> 31:58.926
TARU said Melissa's phone
pinged in the vicinity

31:58.950 --> 32:00.795
of 37 Prince Street about 20 minutes ago.

32:00.819 --> 32:03.598
- It's got to be it.
- Well, it looks like a doctor's office.

32:03.941 --> 32:05.574
- It's a gynecologist.
- That appropriate?

32:05.598 --> 32:07.909
- Should we wait outside?
- What? Are you serious?

32:07.933 --> 32:10.438
We've been looking for her
for two days. For all we know,

32:10.462 --> 32:13.274
she's probably come and gone.
We have to go inside.

32:13.298 --> 32:15.766
Okay. We'll go inside.

32:20.805 --> 32:23.518
Melissa, we need to talk to you.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.152
This is none of your business.

32:25.176 --> 32:26.714
No, it <i>is</i> our business.

32:27.865 --> 32:29.966
Is Felix the father?

32:32.011 --> 32:33.203
Yes.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.931
Then, who found out about it
and killed him?

32:36.955 --> 32:38.733
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.001
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:40.025 --> 32:42.370
Look, we know that Allie wired you money.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.372
You've been on the run for two days.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.607
Allie didn't kill him.
She could never. She...

32:46.631 --> 32:48.309
She just told me

32:48.333 --> 32:50.144
to lay low until the press dies down.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.713
She gave me a place to stay,
paid for this appointment.

32:52.737 --> 32:54.918
Well, your father thinks
you're not having this baby.

32:54.942 --> 32:58.353
Yeah, well, I don't know how I'd
support it on my own. Don't you see?

32:58.377 --> 33:00.645
Allie was kind enough
to make me an appointment here

33:00.669 --> 33:02.156
to consider my options.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.491
Kind enough?

33:03.515 --> 33:04.625
She's not kind.

33:04.649 --> 33:05.749
She's playing you.

33:05.773 --> 33:07.421
If Felix is the father,

33:07.445 --> 33:09.797
she'll have to share
half the estate with you.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.689
And she's not gonna do that.

33:12.677 --> 33:15.055
Okay, but Allie didn't kill him.

33:15.859 --> 33:17.390
Then who <i>did</i> kill him?

33:19.237 --> 33:21.311
Come on, Melissa. If you know
who killed him, you got to tell us.

33:21.336 --> 33:24.119
I couldn't admit to him
that I'd had consensual sex,

33:24.144 --> 33:26.022
so I told him Felix raped me, okay?

33:26.047 --> 33:28.659
Like they said
he did to all the other girls.

33:30.236 --> 33:32.709
When I told him, he said I was tainted.

33:32.733 --> 33:34.688
He was more upset
than I had ever seen him, and...

33:34.712 --> 33:36.958
Okay. Who is "he"?

33:36.982 --> 33:39.450
Who is the "he" that killed Felix?

33:43.968 --> 33:45.333
My father.

34:01.731 --> 34:02.975
Hey.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.677
Looking for Hector Rodriguez.

34:04.701 --> 34:06.920
- Seen him?
- I don't know any Hector Rodriguez.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.965
Says he don't know Hector.

34:08.989 --> 34:10.734
Well, that's funny
'cause his daughter said

34:10.757 --> 34:12.005
he practically lives here.

34:12.029 --> 34:13.770
Yeah, I'm sorry. No Hector tonight.

34:13.793 --> 34:15.605
So you <i>do</i> know Hector?

34:15.629 --> 34:17.607
Hey! Talking to you.

34:17.630 --> 34:19.708
Yeah, but he's not here.

34:20.289 --> 34:21.679
Okay, play stupid.

34:21.703 --> 34:24.880
Anybody want to point us in the
direction of Hector Rodriguez?

34:26.076 --> 34:27.250
No? Okay.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.518
Maybe we'll start checking
all your papers then, huh?

34:30.076 --> 34:31.976
What do you say?

34:34.114 --> 34:36.293
Hey. What the hell are you doing?

34:36.317 --> 34:37.793
- Excuse me?
- What are you doing

34:37.818 --> 34:39.094
right there with the button?

34:39.119 --> 34:40.196
Where does the button ring?

34:40.219 --> 34:41.364
Basement? Bathroom?

34:41.388 --> 34:42.436
What?

34:42.956 --> 34:44.456
Okay.

34:46.092 --> 34:47.223
Step back.

34:47.248 --> 34:49.159
You, move. Come on. Move!

34:49.184 --> 34:50.360
All right.

34:50.563 --> 34:51.630
Get back.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.829
Hector?

35:11.785 --> 35:13.542
- Hector! Hold it!
- Go! Go! Go!

35:14.488 --> 35:16.032
Wait!

35:16.056 --> 35:17.608
Hold it!

35:17.632 --> 35:19.669
Hey!

35:19.693 --> 35:21.471
Go!

35:23.263 --> 35:25.442
Get your hands where I can see
'em right now! Get 'em up!

35:25.466 --> 35:27.410
- All right. No, no, no, no.
- Hands up!

35:27.434 --> 35:29.848
No, no, no, I got nothing.
Driver, get your hands up, too.

35:29.872 --> 35:31.815
Keep 'em where
I can see 'em now! Hands up!

35:31.839 --> 35:33.616
Out of the car. Come on.
Hands on the vehicle.

35:33.640 --> 35:34.905
Right there.

35:35.876 --> 35:37.854
I'm ready to atone for my sins.

35:38.367 --> 35:40.323
I made a terrible mistake.

35:40.347 --> 35:41.892
I didn't mean to hurt him,

35:41.916 --> 35:43.426
but he called her a whore,

35:43.450 --> 35:45.562
and laughing at me.

35:45.586 --> 35:47.364
I'm so sorry.

35:47.388 --> 35:49.833
Roth got what he deserved.

35:49.857 --> 35:52.024
The judge'll decide what you get.

35:55.050 --> 35:56.239
<i>This morning,</i>

35:56.263 --> 35:58.108
the police arrested a suspect trying

35:58.132 --> 36:00.744
to break in to one
of the witnesses' homes.

36:00.768 --> 36:03.012
And this concerns me how?

36:03.036 --> 36:06.383
The suspect is your client's
younger brother Michael.

36:06.407 --> 36:08.418
He was found with Katie Gray's ID

36:08.442 --> 36:09.537
and credit cards.

36:09.561 --> 36:11.688
And he's not my client.

36:11.712 --> 36:14.013
- His brother is.
- Wow.

36:14.037 --> 36:15.592
- That's a fact.
- It's also

36:15.616 --> 36:16.828
a fact that there's a direct line

36:16.852 --> 36:18.862
from that witness list,
that you yourself took

36:18.886 --> 36:20.764
from this office, to that suspect.

36:20.788 --> 36:22.555
I had no idea.

36:23.590 --> 36:25.568
Wasting people's time is a sin.

36:25.592 --> 36:26.870
I am with you there.

36:26.894 --> 36:28.738
But taking a flawed law

36:28.762 --> 36:30.974
and using it
for your own personal gain...

36:30.998 --> 36:32.976
That is a lot worse.

36:33.836 --> 36:36.346
I am just doing what I'm paid for.

36:36.370 --> 36:38.848
Said every coward ever. Now please leave.

36:38.872 --> 36:41.885
All I did was review the list
of witnesses with my client.

36:41.909 --> 36:43.342
- Get out.
- I didn't give...

36:48.248 --> 36:49.816
Hello.

36:55.155 --> 36:58.001
Now, what she did is
not wrong under the law.

36:58.025 --> 36:59.736
All she did was

36:59.760 --> 37:02.772
give her client the witness list
that we handed over.

37:03.243 --> 37:05.442
So we'll fix it.

37:05.871 --> 37:07.177
So, what are we gonna do?

37:07.201 --> 37:10.213
Just give fake names and addresses?

37:10.237 --> 37:12.705
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

37:16.577 --> 37:21.024
Just feels like we keep pushing
the same mountain all the time.

37:21.048 --> 37:22.459
Well, hey,

37:22.483 --> 37:25.585
even if we only get an inch,
that's something, right?

37:31.625 --> 37:34.307
<i>We'll conduct</i> a
thorough investigation,

37:34.331 --> 37:36.940
make sure this isn't a habit
he got covered up.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.875
I watched the video.

37:38.899 --> 37:40.410
He didn't just cross a line.

37:40.434 --> 37:42.278
He drove right over it

37:42.302 --> 37:43.980
- and then backed up again.
- No one just

37:44.004 --> 37:46.257
wakes up one day
and decides to act like that.

37:46.281 --> 37:47.750
Conner's our guy, too.

37:47.774 --> 37:49.219
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

37:49.243 --> 37:50.920
Are you really still defending him?

37:50.944 --> 37:52.689
He deserves due process.

37:52.713 --> 37:54.791
No spin is
gonna change what we saw.

37:54.815 --> 37:57.250
Come on, guys. Whose
side are you on anyway?

37:59.473 --> 38:00.718
Sid.

38:02.014 --> 38:03.581
Boss?

38:06.226 --> 38:08.705
Money and manpower on an investigation?

38:09.226 --> 38:10.707
Seriously?

38:10.731 --> 38:12.108
No?

38:12.563 --> 38:14.106
No.

38:17.589 --> 38:19.236
What's he got coming?

38:20.907 --> 38:23.519
Um... you tell me.

38:23.544 --> 38:25.033
No.

38:25.472 --> 38:26.994
You tell me.

38:32.374 --> 38:34.293
It's not for me to decide.

38:34.855 --> 38:37.045
But I asked you.

38:38.297 --> 38:39.536
Boss?

38:39.719 --> 38:41.216
Lieutenant.

38:44.636 --> 38:46.142
Place Detective Conner

38:46.166 --> 38:48.901
on modified assignment
pending an investigation?

38:52.812 --> 38:55.105
Slap on the wrist, given what we know.

38:56.910 --> 38:58.878
Fleet services?

39:07.721 --> 39:09.799
That kind of bad apple can do damage

39:09.823 --> 39:11.497
we only learn about too late.

39:12.558 --> 39:14.559
Better to be proactive.

39:15.562 --> 39:17.640
Suspension, effective immediately.

39:18.420 --> 39:21.434
Have the department advocate
prepare charges and specs.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.676
Pretty harsh.

39:28.701 --> 39:30.635
Yeah. Sends a message.

39:32.518 --> 39:34.257
And that's your call?

39:35.562 --> 39:37.383
Well... he left us no choice.

39:39.386 --> 39:40.818
Then get on it.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.801
Right away, boss.

40:17.257 --> 40:18.601
Thanks for coming.

40:19.022 --> 40:20.637
Jochens, what are you doing here?

40:20.661 --> 40:23.272
You remember when I busted
my back at the Academy?

40:23.296 --> 40:24.382
Of course.

40:24.406 --> 40:26.824
Dr. Mehta's the one who got me
back on my feet.

40:26.848 --> 40:28.055
All right, but that doesn't...

40:28.079 --> 40:30.380
And remember when we took
that call at the Bedford Houses,

40:30.404 --> 40:31.781
back when we were in the 12th?

40:31.805 --> 40:33.416
Yeah, you went down pretty good.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.251
- And I thought I wasn't gonna...
- Dr. Mehta

40:35.275 --> 40:36.719
helped you recover.

40:36.743 --> 40:38.232
- You starting to follow along?
- Yeah.

40:38.256 --> 40:40.356
I understand
the doc here helped you all out,

40:40.380 --> 40:41.624
but what you're doing is wrong.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.192
Says who?

40:43.216 --> 40:45.028
All we're doing is recommending a doc

40:45.052 --> 40:47.030
we trust to people that
we helped out on the streets.

40:47.054 --> 40:48.464
Actually, you're driving business

40:48.488 --> 40:50.566
to the doc, using private information

40:50.590 --> 40:53.002
that's entrusted to you
as NYPD police officers.

40:53.026 --> 40:54.971
May I say something?

40:55.254 --> 40:56.788
Shoot.

40:57.971 --> 41:00.550
I could barely cover my rent already.

41:00.901 --> 41:04.013
Then, last month,
they upped it on me again.

41:04.037 --> 41:06.906
I was about to close up shop,
when these officers...

41:09.030 --> 41:12.021
...got wind and came to my rescue.

41:12.045 --> 41:13.589
You notice that fancy

41:13.613 --> 41:15.792
- new urgent care next door?
- I'm sure

41:15.816 --> 41:18.582
it doesn't help, but I can't
allow this to continue.

41:20.667 --> 41:22.632
We came up with a compromise.

41:22.656 --> 41:24.000
Which is?

41:24.504 --> 41:26.602
We help him out the right way...

41:26.626 --> 41:29.966
By recommending him
to friends, family, or

41:29.990 --> 41:31.678
whoever we can get to listen.

41:32.018 --> 41:33.629
No more using the reports.

41:33.654 --> 41:36.065
And you expect me to just forget
about what went on up to now?

41:36.090 --> 41:38.302
No, we... we don't expect it.

41:38.327 --> 41:41.897
We... we're just asking for it.

41:48.115 --> 41:49.404
No.

41:50.762 --> 41:52.491
You never asked for it.

41:54.788 --> 41:56.411
Copy that, boss.

41:59.693 --> 42:01.694
Okay, nothing to see here.
