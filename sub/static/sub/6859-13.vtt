00:49.491 --> 00:50.951
Obi-Wan Kenobi,

00:51.437 --> 00:55.602
Once a Jedi master, now a Jedi slave.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.252
Pitiful.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.880
Keep eyes on your toil, skug!

01:33.772 --> 01:37.476
Everything about this place
is design to shadow with the will.

01:37.601 --> 01:39.828
It has already begun to affect
this poor people.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.854
Speech is forbidden.

01:44.128 --> 01:45.162
I'm sorry.

01:45.287 --> 01:46.564
It won't happen again.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.317
There will be punishment!

01:49.453 --> 01:50.892
Stop, it's my mistake.

01:51.017 --> 01:52.219
Leave him alone!

01:57.937 --> 02:00.709
How a slave gives me commands.

02:01.803 --> 02:02.482
Beg!

02:03.121 --> 02:04.975
Beg me, before this one dies.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.456
Because of you!

02:08.330 --> 02:09.162
Please.

02:09.515 --> 02:11.148
Forgive me, master.

02:18.623 --> 02:20.082
Keep away from me.

02:20.356 --> 02:22.352
Jedi only make things worse.

02:39.281 --> 02:43.548
<i>Long have Sith empire has been build
to bond the back of slaves.</i>

02:44.164 --> 02:45.839
<i>To carry on this tradition,</i>

02:45.964 --> 02:47.359
<i>we will require,</i>

02:47.897 --> 02:48.749
<i>millions.</i>

02:49.670 --> 02:54.560
I assure you the queen's defiance
will not sorrow your plans, master.

02:55.050 --> 03:00.570
<i>If she fails to see the error
of her ways, end her rule.</i>

03:19.713 --> 03:22.227
Have you considered my offert?

03:22.642 --> 03:24.619
If you vow loyalty to me,

03:25.166 --> 03:27.477
I will free your friends.

03:28.034 --> 03:29.767
It's not an easy decision.

03:31.247 --> 03:32.149
Curious.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.848
I thought the jedi were selfless.

03:35.060 --> 03:37.392
Placing the needs of others
before their own.

03:46.790 --> 03:47.702
My Queen,

03:48.108 --> 03:49.314
I bring word.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.493
Count Dooku is on his way here.

03:52.986 --> 03:54.639
Sooner than anticipated.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.324
Make preparations for his arrival.

03:59.747 --> 04:01.409
So even you have a master.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.424
Dooku is not my master.

04:05.417 --> 04:08.407
Perhaps you should not
attempt this meeting.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.666
Can I trust you not to run away.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.546
I don't run away from anything,
your highness.

04:35.903 --> 04:38.497
Get off, ya miserable tin can!

04:42.866 --> 04:45.127
Get down there and find that Jedi.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.191
Yes, sir!

05:00.856 --> 05:02.001
Nice work, pal.

05:02.126 --> 05:03.359
You find ahsoka?

05:13.284 --> 05:15.058
I wasn't expecting you Count.

05:15.980 --> 05:17.714
Not without an invitation.

05:18.089 --> 05:19.589
But I was invited.

05:19.933 --> 05:21.849
By your faithful adviser.

05:24.028 --> 05:28.303
He's concerned of how attached
you've become to Skywalker.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.624
Skywalker is a symbol of my...

05:31.546 --> 05:34.131
Our power to enslave even jedi.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.948
Your power over him is an illusion.

05:37.161 --> 05:38.205
You forget.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.703
I was once of Jedi myself.

05:41.271 --> 05:43.430
You have little in commun
with Anakin.

05:45.534 --> 05:46.477
Please.

05:46.872 --> 05:49.365
Care my plans for the Jedi
then decide.

05:50.176 --> 05:51.382
Right now,

05:51.507 --> 05:54.189
At my facility in the Kadavo system,

05:54.477 --> 05:57.178
Obi-Wan Kenobi is in despair.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.418
I'm listening.

05:59.543 --> 06:01.749
Kenobi is coming to realize,

06:01.874 --> 06:04.205
Perhaps for the first time
in his life.

06:04.854 --> 06:08.138
That is effort to help others
will only injure them.

06:13.350 --> 06:16.735
<i>As plans for escape
and hope for rescue faide.</i>

06:17.282 --> 06:18.609
<i>The gnawing fear,</i>

06:18.734 --> 06:20.765
<i>that he will never be
able to take action</i>

06:20.890 --> 06:22.562
<i>will grow in Kenobi's heart.</i>

06:25.231 --> 06:28.342
<i>To ease the burden
of his fellow slaves.</i>

06:28.657 --> 06:31.302
<i>Defiance, will become compliance.</i>

06:32.705 --> 06:35.624
<i>When Kenobi realize that he cannot
help those around him,</i>

06:36.212 --> 06:38.168
<i>his spirit will break,</i>

06:38.655 --> 06:41.543
<i>and he will be mine.</i>

06:42.592 --> 06:45.998
If such Jedi as Skywalker
and Kenobi can fall,

06:46.510 --> 06:48.841
how many other will follow?

06:52.454 --> 06:56.240
Imagine an army
of Jedi in your service.

06:56.365 --> 06:59.091
Zygerria will be invincible.

06:59.775 --> 07:02.674
The most ambitious plan
your highness.

07:03.454 --> 07:07.194
Only my call is not the enslavement
of the jedi order.

07:07.812 --> 07:09.697
But it extermination.

07:10.245 --> 07:12.469
I have come to supervise
their execution.

07:12.594 --> 07:14.425
Perform it, if necessary.

07:14.973 --> 07:15.824
Now...

07:16.432 --> 07:17.770
summon skywalker.

07:36.237 --> 07:37.423
{PUB}Hello master.

07:37.548 --> 07:39.660
It took you long enought.

07:39.785 --> 07:41.619
I knew you had a nice view.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.019
Are you okay?

07:59.637 --> 08:01.471
I sense a disturbance in the force.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.482
It's Dooku.
I need you to get our ship.

08:04.715 --> 08:06.073
Here, take this comlink.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.917
Where are you going?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.990
The Queen knows where Obi-Wan is.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.402
Hold on to that comlink
and wait for my signal.

08:15.149 --> 08:16.274
Come on, artoo.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.978
I have no desire
to end Skywalker's life.

08:23.566 --> 08:24.671
He has become,

08:24.894 --> 08:27.640
a valuable asset to me in my throne.

08:27.985 --> 08:30.417
Your compliance is not optional.

08:30.671 --> 08:33.303
I command you to kill Skywalker.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.761
I will not be ordered
about in my own palace, Count!

08:37.475 --> 08:39.529
If you won't to do my bidding,

08:39.654 --> 08:42.134
Perhaps your prime minister will.

08:43.453 --> 08:44.982
What does he mean?

08:45.150 --> 08:48.330
I'm sorry your majesty,
but the Count is right.

08:48.716 --> 08:50.337
The Jedi should die.

08:51.049 --> 08:53.401
You're not fit to be Queen anylonger.

08:54.049 --> 08:55.874
Atai, you traitor!

08:56.370 --> 08:59.036
I'll make you both pay
for this treachery.

09:05.902 --> 09:09.510
Punishment for a slave
who disobeys her master.

09:10.645 --> 09:12.064
That's enough, Dooku!

09:20.237 --> 09:23.349
I see the queen
has given you a long leech.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.142
One more step,

09:25.386 --> 09:27.463
and I will end her life.

09:27.707 --> 09:30.423
Why would you think
I care about the slaver scum?

09:31.325 --> 09:32.085
Indeed.

10:00.147 --> 10:01.383
The Queen!

10:01.636 --> 10:03.560
She was murdered by the Jedi.

10:08.180 --> 10:09.983
That's our signal, let's get going.

10:22.062 --> 10:23.538
Take your vengeance!

10:44.519 --> 10:45.644
Your highness.

10:45.938 --> 10:47.205
No escape.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.397
For any of us.

10:51.213 --> 10:52.774
Where is Obi-Wan?

10:53.027 --> 10:53.797
Tell me.

10:55.234 --> 10:56.663
Kadavo system.

10:57.596 --> 11:00.221
You were right, Skywalker.

11:02.410 --> 11:03.880
I am a slave,

11:04.789 --> 11:07.344
just as you are.

11:39.169 --> 11:41.703
Someone wishes to speak with you.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.524
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

11:45.783 --> 11:48.468
<i>in chains once again I see.</i>

11:48.593 --> 11:49.770
Count Dooku,

11:50.126 --> 11:52.343
still afraid to get your hands dirty?

11:52.837 --> 11:55.981
I would gladly make
an exception my friend.

11:56.591 --> 12:01.931
I wanted to say a proper farewell
before keeper Agruss puts you to death.

12:22.819 --> 12:25.565
Keeper, this ship is making
unschedule landing

12:25.690 --> 12:27.187
on platform two-four.

12:44.392 --> 12:46.204
So much for a ride home.

12:46.329 --> 12:49.004
- What now?
- We get through the old-fashioned way.

12:53.249 --> 12:54.080
<i>Kenobi,</i>

12:54.205 --> 12:56.608
<i>tell your young friend Skywalker,</i>

12:56.776 --> 12:58.256
<i>if he does not surrender,</i>

12:58.570 --> 13:01.884
<i>the slaves will be terminated
in his name.</i>

13:06.440 --> 13:07.647
<i>I'm glad to see you.</i>

13:07.912 --> 13:09.998
<i>But I'm afraid our host
feels otherwise.</i>

13:10.373 --> 13:12.165
You can't make eveyone happy.

13:13.185 --> 13:15.982
<i>Then threaten to kill the slaves
unless you surrender.</i>

13:16.107 --> 13:18.443
It's good to see you always
ready to negociate.

13:18.568 --> 13:20.960
But I've had enough
bargaining with slave drivers.

13:21.342 --> 13:24.386
<i>You must realize this is a fight
you cannot win alone.</i>

13:25.046 --> 13:26.404
Who said I was alone?

13:39.002 --> 13:41.698
A fleet of four ships have jumped
of hyperspace in sector six.

13:41.911 --> 13:43.461
Jedi reinforcements.

13:49.037 --> 13:52.080
The whole fleet as a wolf pack.
Celerate to attack speed

13:52.248 --> 13:54.357
This is Warthog.
We're going in.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.052
Rex! Now!

14:02.397 --> 14:03.451
About time.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.534
Those tower are ray-shielded.

14:16.257 --> 14:18.791
I hope you told master Plo
not to destroy this installation,

14:18.916 --> 14:20.433
before we get off of it.

14:21.071 --> 14:22.662
All of us, and the slaves.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.114
We'll need a bigger ship.

15:07.121 --> 15:08.240
{PUB}Catch too much hit.

15:10.199 --> 15:11.906
R7, cut the engines!

15:26.942 --> 15:28.860
You got him, good work general.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.725
Keep your focus, Warthog.

15:30.850 --> 15:32.426
Watch out for those towers!

15:57.729 --> 15:59.875
The walls, they're electrified.

16:39.978 --> 16:41.859
The controls are destroyed,
master Plo.

16:41.984 --> 16:43.611
There is nothing we can do from here.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.714
I cannot move the cruiser
in the rescue operation

16:48.839 --> 16:51.116
until those enemy cannons
aren't destroyed.

16:51.241 --> 16:52.991
<i>We'll take care of those cannons.</i>

16:53.116 --> 16:56.227
Make sure that cruiser gets down here.
We're running out of time.

16:56.498 --> 16:57.974
I'm going to go help my people.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.474
- I'll see if I can buy us some time.
- Good luck.

17:11.094 --> 17:12.016
Incoming.

17:32.009 --> 17:32.877
A jedi!

17:59.745 --> 18:00.792
We're all clear.

18:00.917 --> 18:02.976
Bring the cruiser down
to the landing pad.

18:03.101 --> 18:04.581
Cancel that order, master!

18:04.706 --> 18:06.334
<i>There is no way to get the people,</i>

18:06.502 --> 18:08.902
out of the holding cell
and up to the landing platform.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.422
But I have an idea.

18:10.547 --> 18:13.381
We need to have the cruiser
move in underneath the facility.

18:13.506 --> 18:15.125
We can escape on to the ship,

18:15.250 --> 18:17.429
<i>If admiral Coburn can get
a close enought.</i>

18:18.047 --> 18:19.416
You heard commander Tano.

18:19.541 --> 18:22.010
I want the men top side
as rocket packs and cable guns.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.622
- Move it!
- Yes sir!

18:39.457 --> 18:40.997
Come now, master Kenobi.

18:41.464 --> 18:44.873
I know a jedi won't kill
an unarmed man.

18:51.478 --> 18:52.593
I'm no jedi.

19:27.594 --> 19:29.337
Okay, everyone. Get ready.

19:29.672 --> 19:31.252
We'll have to go by groups.

19:53.251 --> 19:54.011
Gotcha!

20:07.540 --> 20:09.365
That's everyone.
We have to go.

20:09.490 --> 20:11.453
The facility's breaking up.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.549
Okay, master Plo.
The cruiser is clear.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.358
All gunships, fire!

20:50.166 --> 20:52.545
I thank you, Jedi,

20:52.670 --> 20:55.079
and the republic
for saving our lifes.

20:55.204 --> 20:56.819
Ahsoka is the real hero.

20:56.944 --> 20:58.329
Without her creativity,

20:58.454 --> 21:00.650
I don't think we would gone
your people to safety.

21:01.064 --> 21:01.997
Indeed.

21:02.564 --> 21:03.700
{pos(190,220)}Padawan Tano,

21:03.825 --> 21:05.597
{pos(190,220)}might I have a word in private?

21:05.994 --> 21:06.987
{pos(190,220)}Of course.

21:13.130 --> 21:14.194
Ahsoka,

21:14.427 --> 21:17.103
You have done a great deed
for your people today.

21:17.478 --> 21:18.441
You're sad?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.938
You and the Jedi have done your best,

21:22.063 --> 21:24.164
but I do not think
our people will recover

21:24.289 --> 21:26.829
from this horror anytime soon.

21:27.356 --> 21:29.579
I understand, but in the end,

21:30.062 --> 21:32.839
surviving this were only
strenght on the people.

21:32.964 --> 21:33.791
Perhaps.

21:34.484 --> 21:36.896
And perhaps the people of Kiros,

21:37.021 --> 21:39.167
will also join the republic.

21:39.552 --> 21:41.640
I think that's a wise choice,
governor.
