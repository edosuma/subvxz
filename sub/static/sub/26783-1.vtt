WEBVTT

00:12.052 --> 00:13.984
<i>Great, great.</i>

00:14.020 --> 00:15.619
I will have all the Christmas
decorations

00:15.655 --> 00:17.321
in your office
before you know it.

00:17.357 --> 00:18.856
No one is going to recognize
this place

00:18.891 --> 00:20.291
when they come in tomorrow.

00:20.326 --> 00:22.693
Wow. It's gonna be beautiful.

00:22.728 --> 00:25.729
Well, Christmas is kind of
my specialty.

00:25.765 --> 00:27.565
I wish we had known about you
last year.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.467
Oh, I haven't been
in Boston that long.

00:29.502 --> 00:31.802
I moved from Seattle
just after last Christmas

00:31.837 --> 00:34.038
to start my own
interior design company.

00:34.074 --> 00:35.673
That's a long way to come.

00:35.708 --> 00:38.676
Well, that wasn't
the only reason.

00:38.711 --> 00:40.010
Oh, no?

00:40.046 --> 00:41.345
No.

00:41.381 --> 00:43.448
Uh, I found out that I had
family in Vermont.

00:43.483 --> 00:44.582
[ding]

00:46.219 --> 00:48.419
But it wasn't just spending time
with my family

00:48.455 --> 00:50.521
over Christmas that made it
so wonderful.

00:50.557 --> 00:51.889
I met someone.

00:51.958 --> 00:53.491
Someone very special.

00:53.560 --> 00:56.427
Something tells me he felt
the same way about you.

00:56.496 --> 00:58.862
Before I met Ian, I spent most
of my life trying to avoid

00:58.898 --> 01:03.367
the holiday hoopla but he made
me believe in Christmas again.

01:03.436 --> 01:05.303
We had fallen in love
at Christmas

01:05.337 --> 01:07.972
so it just seemed right for us
to get engaged then, too.

01:08.007 --> 01:09.974
He proposed? At Christmas?

01:10.009 --> 01:11.309
Mmmhmm.

01:11.377 --> 01:12.743
That's so romantic.

01:12.778 --> 01:14.878
We rode up on a horse-drawn
carriage to a gazebo

01:14.947 --> 01:16.481
shining with Christmas lights.

01:16.549 --> 01:18.048
So when are you getting married?

01:18.084 --> 01:19.283
Christmas Day.

01:19.319 --> 01:20.751
Oh my gosh, that's perfect.

01:20.786 --> 01:22.686
And the greatest part
of the story

01:22.722 --> 01:24.322
is it's just getting started.

01:44.110 --> 01:50.281
[phone rings]

01:50.316 --> 01:51.616
I was just thinking about you.

01:51.651 --> 01:53.717
Hey, I'm still trying to find
a gift for your folks.

01:53.786 --> 01:54.852
Any ideas?

01:54.887 --> 01:56.521
<i>Hey, remember what they said.</i>

01:56.556 --> 01:58.556
"This wedding is all
we want for Christmas."

01:58.625 --> 02:00.324
I know, but I'd still like
to thank them

02:00.393 --> 02:02.527
for letting us have the wedding
dinner at the inn.

02:02.562 --> 02:03.894
Are you kidding?

02:03.963 --> 02:06.130
They've absolutely loved
helping us make all our plans.

02:06.166 --> 02:07.231
<i>I know.</i>

02:07.267 --> 02:08.999
<i>They're so sweet.</i>

02:09.035 --> 02:12.136
So when're you heading back?

02:12.172 --> 02:13.704
I just have a few things
to wrap up

02:13.739 --> 02:15.339
at the office tomorrow morning.

02:15.375 --> 02:17.941
Uh- huh. And then
you're coming home?

02:17.977 --> 02:20.778
Ian, I've barely been
gone a week.

02:20.813 --> 02:23.814
<i>Doesn't mean I can't miss you.</i>

02:23.883 --> 02:26.350
And then I'm coming home.

02:26.386 --> 02:28.186
I love you.

02:28.254 --> 02:30.221
I love you, too.

02:38.331 --> 02:40.130
Oh, Ian, good.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.466
Do you know when Miranda
plans on going back to Boston

02:42.502 --> 02:43.668
for her final dress fitting?

02:43.703 --> 02:45.403
She's still in Boston, mom.

02:45.438 --> 02:47.805
But do you know when her final
dress fitting is?

02:47.840 --> 02:50.474
It is so sweet, she asked me
to go with her and Margaret.

02:50.510 --> 02:53.077
But I still have to schedule
the wedding cake delivery.

02:53.145 --> 02:56.581
Right. Ok, uh, I can be here
for that then.

02:56.616 --> 02:58.216
Like you won't have
enough to do?

02:58.251 --> 02:59.850
You worry too much, mom.

02:59.885 --> 03:01.419
Trust me, this wedding's
gonna be great.

03:01.454 --> 03:03.787
That's exactly what your father
said on our wedding day.

03:03.823 --> 03:05.989
Just before the roof in
the church started to leak.

03:06.025 --> 03:07.558
Oh.

03:07.594 --> 03:10.828
As I recall it was more like
a downpour than a leak.

03:10.863 --> 03:12.296
[laughs]

03:12.332 --> 03:13.764
And when everyone was running
around looking for

03:13.799 --> 03:16.133
a mop and a bucket
my husband to be

03:16.168 --> 03:17.801
got a big grin on his face.

03:17.837 --> 03:19.237
Could you blame me?

03:19.272 --> 03:20.605
If the wedding was that much fun

03:20.673 --> 03:22.106
I couldn't wait for
the marriage to start.

03:22.141 --> 03:23.474
[laughs]

03:32.652 --> 03:38.723
[phone buzzes]

03:38.791 --> 03:39.857
Hi, Margaret.

03:39.925 --> 03:41.125
Hello, Miranda.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.260
I know that you're busy,

03:42.295 --> 03:43.694
I hope that I'm not
interrupting.

03:43.730 --> 03:44.995
<i>Not at all, no.</i>

03:45.030 --> 03:47.030
I just had some
wonderful news.

03:47.066 --> 03:48.232
What is it?

03:48.268 --> 03:49.833
<i>Well, you remember I spoke
to you about</i>

03:49.869 --> 03:51.435
Yvonne and Amelia Williams,

03:51.471 --> 03:52.536
they were very close
to your father.

03:52.572 --> 03:53.871
Sure, sure.

03:53.906 --> 03:55.673
<i>They're lovely people.</i>

03:55.708 --> 03:58.842
I am so delighted, they would
love to come to the wedding.

04:00.413 --> 04:02.012
Oh.

04:02.047 --> 04:03.381
Really?

04:03.416 --> 04:07.451
I know that I should have spoken
to you about this but...

04:07.487 --> 04:09.219
well, I hope you understand,

04:09.255 --> 04:11.389
they cared so much
about your father

04:11.424 --> 04:14.825
and when they heard that
he had a daughter they-

04:14.894 --> 04:17.495
well, and you're such an
important part of this family,

04:17.529 --> 04:20.096
they said they couldn't
wait to meet you.

04:22.535 --> 04:25.068
Thank you, that's
really wonderful.

04:42.789 --> 04:44.355
Miranda.

04:44.390 --> 04:46.757
When you and I met
two years ago

04:46.793 --> 04:51.829
there's no way we
could have known that...

04:51.864 --> 05:01.305
there... there was no way
we could have known that...

05:01.341 --> 05:04.342
that I would never be able
to write my own wedding vows.

05:24.230 --> 05:25.596
Excuse me.

05:25.631 --> 05:26.664
Hi.

05:26.733 --> 05:28.699
Hi.

05:28.735 --> 05:31.101
Um, I'm looking
for Miranda Chester.

05:31.136 --> 05:32.336
I'm Miranda.

05:32.405 --> 05:33.404
Hi.

05:33.439 --> 05:34.605
Hi.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.939
My name's Charles Finley.

05:35.975 --> 05:37.241
I don't have an appointment,
I'm afraid.

05:37.276 --> 05:41.679
That's ok, but I'm- I'm not
actually here today.

05:41.714 --> 05:43.180
I'm- I'm sorry?

05:43.249 --> 05:44.882
I just mean I'm only here
to wrap up a few things

05:44.917 --> 05:46.817
and then I'm leaving
until after the holidays.

05:46.853 --> 05:48.285
Right.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.653
Oh, you're getting married.

05:49.722 --> 05:52.222
I am, yes. Christmas day.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.124
Wow.

05:54.159 --> 05:55.426
Um, congratulations.

05:55.461 --> 05:56.861
Thank you.

05:56.896 --> 05:58.161
So then I guess you're not
taking on

05:58.197 --> 06:01.198
any new office decorating
clients today.

06:01.233 --> 06:02.600
I'm not, no.

06:02.668 --> 06:05.736
But let me take down
your contact information

06:05.772 --> 06:07.371
and then I can get
back to you-

06:07.407 --> 06:08.806
Uh, no.

06:08.841 --> 06:11.275
Don't worry, I'll get back
in touch with you.

06:11.310 --> 06:12.242
Ok.

06:12.278 --> 06:13.243
Yeah.

06:51.684 --> 06:54.351
What are you doing here?

06:54.386 --> 06:56.587
I thought I'd wait so I could,
you know,

06:56.622 --> 06:58.722
be the first to welcome
you back.

07:05.798 --> 07:09.800
So, how long have you
been waiting?

07:09.836 --> 07:13.437
Not long, just a couple
of days.

07:18.878 --> 07:20.310
Totally worth it.

07:20.346 --> 07:21.946
Oh, you!

07:22.482 --> 07:24.214
Coming, I'm coming!

07:24.249 --> 07:26.016
Ah, there she is!

07:26.051 --> 07:26.817
Hi!

07:26.853 --> 07:28.352
Hello, Miranda.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.419
Hi, Ellie.

07:29.455 --> 07:30.721
Merry Christmas.

07:30.756 --> 07:32.490
Merry Christmas.
Everything looks so beautiful.

07:32.525 --> 07:33.824
Oh, thank you.

07:33.860 --> 07:35.058
Hello, Ian.

07:35.094 --> 07:37.327
We have our girl back
for another Christmas.

07:37.363 --> 07:38.496
And you know what they say.

07:38.531 --> 07:40.163
Third time's the charm.

07:40.232 --> 07:42.232
Well, it certainly is
for you two.

07:42.267 --> 07:43.534
Hi Aunt Miranda!

07:43.569 --> 07:44.768
Oooh!

07:44.804 --> 07:45.970
Merry Christmas.

07:46.005 --> 07:47.437
Merry Christmas.

07:47.507 --> 07:49.339
You guys must have been
very busy

07:49.375 --> 07:51.074
while I was in Boston
this time.

07:51.110 --> 07:52.275
Do you like the tree?

07:52.311 --> 07:53.844
I think it's the best
one yet.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.212
It's amazing.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.914
Miranda, I've been practicing
how to throw the petals

07:56.949 --> 07:58.348
when I'm the flower girl
at your wedding.

07:58.384 --> 08:00.450
Really? That's great.

08:00.486 --> 08:03.086
It's a very important job,
you know.

08:03.122 --> 08:04.421
But I'm the ring bearer.

08:04.456 --> 08:05.956
You can't have a wedding
without the rings.

08:05.992 --> 08:06.991
Mmm-mmm.

08:07.026 --> 08:08.458
That's right, buddy.

08:08.494 --> 08:09.359
You know, I was a ring bearer
when I was about your age.

08:09.395 --> 08:10.728
Really?

08:10.763 --> 08:12.162
Mmmhmm. If you have any
questions just ask away.

08:12.197 --> 08:13.397
Thanks, Ian.

08:13.432 --> 08:14.598
[laughs]

08:14.634 --> 08:15.566
Ok, I'm gonna go put these
things in my room.

08:15.601 --> 08:16.901
I'll come with you.

08:16.969 --> 08:18.035
I'll get the rest of your things
from the car.

08:18.103 --> 08:19.570
Oh, here you go.

08:23.442 --> 08:26.577
Oh, you put up all the Christmas
decorations.

08:26.612 --> 08:29.479
Well, we love having you
for the holidays.

08:29.515 --> 08:30.714
But fair warning,

08:30.750 --> 08:32.015
we're gonna have to make
the most of it this year

08:32.051 --> 08:33.482
because next year
you're gonna be

08:33.519 --> 08:35.184
in your own home for Christmas.

08:35.254 --> 08:37.054
I know, I can hardly believe it.

08:37.089 --> 08:38.488
The first day that we met did
you ever imagine

08:38.524 --> 08:39.990
things would turn out this way?

08:40.025 --> 08:41.291
Well, when you fall in love
at Christmas

08:41.326 --> 08:43.360
I can't imagine things
turning out any other way.

08:43.395 --> 08:44.895
[laughs]

08:46.832 --> 08:49.332
Thank you, Pastor Wayland,
for performing our ceremony.

08:49.368 --> 08:51.635
We really appreciate you taking
time out of your Christmas

08:51.671 --> 08:53.771
to marry us on Christmas day.

08:53.806 --> 08:55.539
My pleasure, Miranda.

08:55.575 --> 08:57.575
Now that we have
this chance to talk,

08:57.610 --> 09:00.744
just the two of us, I've known
Ian and his family for years.

09:00.813 --> 09:02.546
I'd like to get to know you
a little better.

09:02.582 --> 09:03.981
Well, that sounds great.

09:04.050 --> 09:07.217
You know, Margaret and I have
known each other forever.

09:07.286 --> 09:11.254
As a matter of fact I married her
son Peter to his wife, Ellie.

09:11.323 --> 09:12.790
She told me.

09:12.825 --> 09:15.525
So you've known Margaret
a very long time.

09:15.561 --> 09:18.195
You must have known
her husband, James.

09:18.230 --> 09:21.899
I knew your father
very well, yes.

09:21.934 --> 09:24.835
Sorry. I guess I'm still
just getting used to the idea

09:24.870 --> 09:27.071
of people knowing
I was his daughter.

09:27.106 --> 09:31.108
Well, I can assure you Margaret
is making sure everyone knows.

09:31.143 --> 09:32.843
I'm beginning to get
that feeling.

09:32.878 --> 09:34.645
But let me ask you something.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.947
Why Christmas day?

09:36.983 --> 09:39.249
What's so important about that?

09:41.787 --> 09:45.856
Christmas was always
very special to my mom.

09:45.891 --> 09:48.592
But after I lost her I...

09:48.628 --> 09:49.727
I guess I didn't really feel

09:49.762 --> 09:52.997
like I had anything
to celebrate.

09:53.032 --> 09:56.700
But all that changed
after I found my family

09:56.736 --> 09:58.836
and met Ian.

09:58.904 --> 10:02.072
Now it feels like
everything good in my life

10:02.141 --> 10:04.474
has come out of Christmas.

10:04.510 --> 10:06.376
So what better way to start
our lives together

10:06.411 --> 10:11.248
than to do so on the day
that makes us both so happy?

10:11.283 --> 10:12.916
I agree.

10:15.587 --> 10:18.722
So I talked to Pastor Wayland,
we're all set,

10:18.758 --> 10:20.290
the only thing is he wants
to talk to both of us

10:20.325 --> 10:21.892
before the wedding.

10:21.927 --> 10:23.360
Oh, absolutely.

10:23.395 --> 10:25.062
Just let me know when.

10:25.131 --> 10:26.930
How are you doing on your vows?

10:26.966 --> 10:28.699
Yeah, uh, yeah, great.

10:30.369 --> 10:32.402
Really.

10:32.437 --> 10:35.839
I have never known you to be
at a loss for words before.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.374
What? No. No.

10:37.409 --> 10:38.809
We said that we were gonna
write our own vows

10:38.878 --> 10:40.377
and that's what I'm gonna do.

10:40.412 --> 10:46.516
I'm just trying to find a way
to say uh... stuff.

10:46.552 --> 10:47.718
Stuff.

10:47.787 --> 10:48.986
Yeah.

10:51.090 --> 10:54.591
Anyway, let's go see how my
dad's making out on the set.

11:08.741 --> 11:10.207
Oh, there you are.

11:10.275 --> 11:11.742
Hi.

11:11.777 --> 11:14.178
Looks like Ian's really put
everyone to work in there.

11:14.213 --> 11:15.846
Well, if they'd stop laughing
long enough

11:15.881 --> 11:17.380
to get any actual work done...

11:17.416 --> 11:18.849
[laughs]

11:18.884 --> 11:20.350
I didn't realize
until I got back here

11:20.385 --> 11:21.651
just how much I was looking
forward to singing

11:21.687 --> 11:23.386
a Christmas carol again.

11:23.422 --> 11:25.723
And before you know it you
will have that thing memorized

11:25.758 --> 11:27.191
just like the rest of us.

11:27.259 --> 11:28.759
[laughs]

11:28.794 --> 11:30.694
By the way, I heard from another
of James' friends this morning.

11:30.730 --> 11:31.829
Really?

11:31.864 --> 11:34.698
Yeah, Thomas Reed,
an old fellow actor.

11:34.734 --> 11:37.701
He said he'd love to come
to the wedding.

11:37.737 --> 11:42.239
Oh, um... you invited him, too.

11:42.307 --> 11:45.442
I did it again, didn't I?

11:45.477 --> 11:48.411
Um, it's just that I am so
excited about this wedding

11:48.480 --> 11:51.215
and about you and...

11:51.250 --> 11:54.118
and the fact that you and I
can do this together.

11:54.153 --> 11:56.386
Well, I think it's so wonderful
that they can come,

11:56.421 --> 11:59.289
I just- I'm not sure there'll be
enough room at the cottage, so-

11:59.324 --> 12:00.758
You're exactly right.

12:00.793 --> 12:02.525
I mean, that- that place
is too small.

12:02.561 --> 12:05.395
But I think that I have
a solution.

12:05.464 --> 12:06.764
You do?

12:06.799 --> 12:10.400
Why not have the wedding
at Peter and Ellie's house?

12:10.469 --> 12:12.502
And we can put up a tent
on the back lawn

12:12.571 --> 12:14.738
and that way you'll have
plenty of room.

12:14.774 --> 12:16.240
Oh, your father
and I just had

12:16.308 --> 12:20.043
the most wonderful
parties there.

12:20.079 --> 12:21.879
That's... I...

12:21.914 --> 12:25.415
Just think about it, ok?

12:25.450 --> 12:27.151
I will.

12:31.991 --> 12:33.690
[sighs]

12:33.725 --> 12:36.559
Ian, Margaret invited
so many people.

12:36.595 --> 12:38.228
Well, we'll talk to her
about that.

12:38.297 --> 12:40.164
You didn't see her face.

12:40.199 --> 12:42.232
I've never seen her like that.

12:42.268 --> 12:47.637
When she talks about our wedding
she's just so... vibrant.

12:47.706 --> 12:51.574
It's like for the first time
she wants everyone to know.

12:51.610 --> 12:52.810
To know?

12:52.878 --> 12:54.544
What do you mean?

12:54.579 --> 12:56.180
Look.

12:57.316 --> 13:00.818
Everyone she invited,
they knew my father.

13:00.853 --> 13:02.019
Mmmhmm.

13:02.087 --> 13:03.153
Cared about him.

13:03.222 --> 13:04.354
Mmmhmm.

13:04.389 --> 13:05.856
I think, for Margaret,
our wedding is a chance

13:05.891 --> 13:09.626
to show people that I'm a part
of him and he's a part of me

13:09.695 --> 13:14.664
and she cares about me
the way he would have.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.666
That's actually pretty sweet.

13:16.702 --> 13:19.903
I know.

13:19.939 --> 13:21.138
What would you like to do?

13:21.173 --> 13:23.640
I don't know.

13:23.675 --> 13:25.008
Come here.

13:33.518 --> 13:36.920
I just can't help
but wonder...

13:36.956 --> 13:39.156
what if something happens?

13:39.191 --> 13:41.358
Happens, like what?

13:41.426 --> 13:46.529
I don't know, just something
to spoil this for us.

13:46.598 --> 13:48.298
Nothing is gonna spoil this
for us.

13:48.367 --> 13:49.532
I promise.

13:49.568 --> 13:50.834
How can you be so sure?

13:50.870 --> 13:52.269
Because I'm pretty sure
that every couple

13:52.304 --> 13:55.239
wants their wedding day to be
perfect just like we do.

13:55.274 --> 13:57.374
And they worry about
what can go wrong.

13:57.442 --> 14:00.110
But there are two things that
I feel very confident about.

14:00.179 --> 14:01.745
What?

14:01.813 --> 14:04.014
The first is something
always goes wrong.

14:04.083 --> 14:05.582
Great.

14:05.617 --> 14:07.784
And the second is that something
always goes wrong.

14:07.819 --> 14:09.119
Ian!

14:09.154 --> 14:10.587
[laughs]

14:10.622 --> 14:12.155
But nothing is gonna stop us
from having the wedding day

14:12.191 --> 14:13.690
that we've always wanted.

14:13.725 --> 14:15.893
Nothing.

14:15.928 --> 14:17.660
Thank you.

14:22.201 --> 14:23.700
Goodnight.

14:27.306 --> 14:29.572
And the flowers you ordered
for your bouquet are on the way.

14:29.641 --> 14:30.807
They're gonna be beautiful.

14:30.842 --> 14:32.075
Thank you so much, Lydia.

14:32.111 --> 14:33.076
Mmmhmm.

14:33.112 --> 14:34.177
Now, Margaret
mentioned something

14:34.213 --> 14:36.646
about a change of venue
for the wedding?

14:36.681 --> 14:37.680
She did?

14:37.716 --> 14:38.882
It's not a problem,

14:38.918 --> 14:39.849
just be sure to let me know
where you want

14:39.885 --> 14:40.984
everything delivered.

14:41.020 --> 14:42.119
See you later.

14:42.154 --> 14:43.720
Bye.

15:04.543 --> 15:05.475
Thank you.

15:05.510 --> 15:06.476
Yeah.

15:06.545 --> 15:07.544
Merry Christmas.

15:07.579 --> 15:08.711
<i>Merry Christmas to you,
too.</i>

15:30.802 --> 15:32.269
Hi.

15:32.304 --> 15:34.104
Miranda, hi.

15:34.139 --> 15:36.506
Hi, Peter.

15:36.541 --> 15:38.241
No hug for your future
father-in-law?

15:38.277 --> 15:40.243
Well, bring it in.

15:40.279 --> 15:41.511
Nice to see you again.

15:41.546 --> 15:42.712
You too.

15:42.781 --> 15:44.114
I'm sorry I missed you
this morning,

15:44.149 --> 15:45.548
I had to get out of
the house early.

15:45.584 --> 15:47.351
We're finalizing plans for
the Christmas tree lighting.

15:47.386 --> 15:48.551
Oh, no, it's fine.

15:48.620 --> 15:49.853
The kids have kept me busy.

15:49.888 --> 15:51.121
I'm sure they have.

15:51.190 --> 15:52.822
So what brings you
by the theatre?

15:52.858 --> 15:54.257
Well, Ian had some errands
to run

15:54.293 --> 15:55.625
so I thought I'd do
some shopping

15:55.660 --> 15:57.294
and then I saw you outside
of the theatre

15:57.363 --> 15:58.862
talking to someone.

15:58.897 --> 16:00.763
Ah, our mystery man.

16:00.799 --> 16:02.466
No, he seems like
a nice enough guy,

16:02.534 --> 16:04.734
it's just not every day
that someone just drops in

16:04.803 --> 16:06.936
out of nowhere and wants
to make a donation.

16:06.972 --> 16:08.071
A donation?

16:08.107 --> 16:09.373
To the theatre.

16:09.408 --> 16:11.375
Mr. Finley says he'd be more
than happy to help.

16:11.410 --> 16:14.211
So who is this
generous stranger?

16:14.246 --> 16:15.678
Not quite sure.

16:15.714 --> 16:18.815
He found his way here all
the way from sunny California.

16:18.884 --> 16:20.683
California. Really.

16:20.719 --> 16:23.620
He said he remembers dad
from his acting days

16:23.655 --> 16:25.722
and when he read about
the Whitcomb Theatre

16:25.757 --> 16:27.124
he decided to get in touch.

16:27.159 --> 16:29.659
Did he happen to say where
he read about the theatre?

16:29.728 --> 16:31.694
I don't think so.

16:31.730 --> 16:33.130
I'm sure we'll hear more
about it

16:33.165 --> 16:34.964
when we see him the next time.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.733
Oh, he's- he's coming
back to town?

16:36.768 --> 16:38.968
Actually, he said something
about staying at the inn.

16:39.004 --> 16:41.371
He wanted to take in some of
our town's Christmas spirit.

16:41.407 --> 16:44.607
Um, I have a few more errands
to run so I'm gonna go.

16:44.643 --> 16:45.575
- See you at the house.
- Ok.

16:45.610 --> 16:46.543
Bye.

16:46.578 --> 16:47.710
Bye.

16:51.716 --> 16:52.882
<i>Miranda.</i>

16:52.918 --> 16:54.684
Oh, it's so good to see you.

16:54.719 --> 16:55.919
You too.

16:55.954 --> 16:56.886
How are you?

16:56.922 --> 16:58.422
Good.

16:58.457 --> 16:59.423
Yeah? Are you crazed with all
these last minute wedding plans?

16:59.491 --> 17:00.657
Not just yet.

17:00.692 --> 17:01.691
Good, let's keep it that way.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.060
Mmmhmm.

17:03.095 --> 17:05.494
Meanwhile, our Christmas
rush is officially underway.

17:05.531 --> 17:06.628
Mmmhmm.

17:06.665 --> 17:08.165
Plus a wonderful wedding.

17:08.233 --> 17:11.068
So you know where everything is,
uh, help yourself to some tea.

17:11.136 --> 17:12.635
There's fresh scones
in the tea room.

17:12.671 --> 17:14.371
I'll be in as soon as I can,
we'll catch up.

17:14.406 --> 17:15.405
Ok. Thanks, Catherine.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.040
[phone ringing]

17:18.109 --> 17:20.042
Carlton Heath Inn,
Merry Christmas.

17:36.228 --> 17:37.527
Mr. Finley.

17:37.563 --> 17:39.362
Hello, uh, Ms. Chester.

17:39.398 --> 17:40.863
You show up in my office
in Boston

17:40.899 --> 17:42.432
and the next day
you turn up here.

17:42.468 --> 17:44.000
That's no coincidence,
is it?

17:44.035 --> 17:45.202
Miranda-

17:45.270 --> 17:46.803
I know why you're here.

17:46.838 --> 17:48.838
This is about James Whitcomb.

17:48.873 --> 17:50.340
About how no one knew
he was my father-

17:50.375 --> 17:51.508
No. No.

17:51.543 --> 17:54.511
Miranda, this is not
about your father.

17:54.546 --> 17:56.346
I'm here because of
your mother.

17:59.084 --> 18:01.351
What about her?

18:01.386 --> 18:04.221
Um, is there somewhere else
we can talk?

18:09.094 --> 18:12.229
I saw your mother play, Miranda,
in the Tempest.

18:12.297 --> 18:15.265
Eve was mesmerizing.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.267
But so was your father.

18:17.336 --> 18:19.336
A remarkable man from everything
I've heard about him.

18:19.371 --> 18:20.637
So you were there.

18:20.672 --> 18:21.838
You saw them.

18:21.873 --> 18:22.905
Yeah.

18:22.974 --> 18:24.608
Eve invited me.

18:24.643 --> 18:26.776
And how did you know her?

18:30.749 --> 18:32.549
Eve was my sister.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.753
I'm your uncle.

18:45.248 --> 18:46.947
That- that's impossible.

18:46.983 --> 18:49.484
I'm sorry, but my mother
was an only child.

18:49.552 --> 18:51.051
She told me that
when her parents died

18:51.087 --> 18:52.520
she had no other family.

18:52.555 --> 18:53.687
Miranda-

18:53.756 --> 18:55.156
And when she died I had
no other family.

18:55.225 --> 18:56.724
Until I came here.

18:56.759 --> 18:57.958
Please, let me explain.

18:57.994 --> 18:59.427
There's nothing to explain.

18:59.462 --> 19:00.794
You're not the first person
to show up here

19:00.830 --> 19:02.830
at Christmas asking questions,

19:02.865 --> 19:04.932
digging into my family's
privacy,

19:04.967 --> 19:08.536
risking their happiness
and my father's good name.

19:08.571 --> 19:10.004
You're too late.

19:10.039 --> 19:12.373
Whatever it is you're trying
to gain it's not gonna happen

19:12.408 --> 19:16.177
so please just...
leave me alone.

19:16.246 --> 19:18.212
Let us enjoy our Christmas

19:18.248 --> 19:21.415
and let me have the wedding
that I've always wanted.

19:21.451 --> 19:24.718
Look, I never came here
to tell you any of this.

19:24.754 --> 19:27.255
Then why are you here?

19:27.290 --> 19:29.857
Because after I met you
in Boston,

19:29.892 --> 19:31.192
you told me you were
getting married,

19:31.227 --> 19:33.961
I wanted to do something nice
for you.

19:33.996 --> 19:36.430
I knew you'd never accept
a wedding gift

19:36.499 --> 19:39.400
from a complete stranger, so...

19:39.435 --> 19:42.736
So you offered to make a
donation to the theatre.

19:42.805 --> 19:44.138
Yeah.

19:44.174 --> 19:46.274
You told them you were
from California.

19:46.342 --> 19:47.841
That's true.

19:47.877 --> 19:50.278
A small town in the northern
part of the state.

19:50.313 --> 19:51.479
But when you came to my office

19:51.548 --> 19:54.014
you made it seem like
you were from Boston.

19:54.050 --> 19:55.749
Yeah.

19:55.785 --> 19:58.852
Look, I just um...

19:58.888 --> 20:02.089
I wanted an excuse to meet you,
to talk with you.

20:06.896 --> 20:10.631
So you expect me to believe
that my mother had a brother

20:10.667 --> 20:15.469
with a different last name
who she never told me about?

20:15.505 --> 20:17.738
Chester was your mother's
middle name.

20:17.773 --> 20:20.074
She used it for a stage name.

20:23.179 --> 20:28.015
Miranda, I never meant
to upset you.

20:28.050 --> 20:30.218
After I leave tomorrow
you'll never see me again,

20:30.253 --> 20:32.853
I promise.

20:32.888 --> 20:34.788
I'm so sorry.

20:43.799 --> 20:45.499
It was actually Ian's idea
the first time

20:45.535 --> 20:47.201
that we delivered gift baskets
at Christmas.

20:47.237 --> 20:48.569
Remember, Ian?

20:48.605 --> 20:50.838
Mmmhmm. My first year back
helping out with the inn.

20:50.873 --> 20:52.306
It was only a couple days
before Christmas.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.908
And we were in a rush and
we put all of the cookies

20:54.977 --> 20:57.245
in the baskets
with everything else.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.912
Yeah, and dad and I were gonna
deliver them first thing

20:58.948 --> 21:01.382
in the morning so I thought
it would be a good idea

21:01.451 --> 21:03.584
<i>if I put them in the back
of the truck the night before.</i>

21:03.620 --> 21:05.519
<i>That was a bad idea.</i>

21:07.624 --> 21:08.789
What happened?

21:08.824 --> 21:10.558
Sorry, what happened?

21:10.593 --> 21:13.761
It- it turns out raccoons
have a serious sweet tooth.

21:13.796 --> 21:15.195
[laughing]

21:15.231 --> 21:16.397
Uh-huh.

21:16.432 --> 21:17.798
So, needless to say,

21:17.833 --> 21:20.468
we were up very early the next
morning baking cookies.

21:20.536 --> 21:21.535
Mmm.

21:23.539 --> 21:24.772
<i>Oh, there we go.</i>

21:24.807 --> 21:26.140
<i>Alright.</i>

21:38.655 --> 21:39.720
[sighs]

21:54.570 --> 21:56.003
[doorbell rings]

21:56.038 --> 21:57.605
I've got it.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.240
Hi.

22:00.276 --> 22:02.209
My name's Thomas Reed,
I'm here to see Margaret.

22:02.278 --> 22:03.911
Tommy.

22:05.682 --> 22:07.648
Merry Christmas, Margaret.

22:07.684 --> 22:10.083
Merry Christmas.

22:10.119 --> 22:12.052
I- wha- what are you doing here?

22:12.087 --> 22:14.488
I know I should have
called first but uh,

22:14.524 --> 22:15.956
I wanted to surprise you.

22:15.991 --> 22:17.057
To say the least.

22:17.092 --> 22:18.392
[laughs]

22:18.461 --> 22:20.127
Thomas Reed, this is my son,
Peter.

22:20.162 --> 22:21.929
Peter, this is Thomas Reed,

22:21.964 --> 22:23.397
he was a close friend
of your father's.

22:23.433 --> 22:24.799
They were in the theatre
together.

22:24.834 --> 22:26.166
We met back in the day
when your mom

22:26.235 --> 22:28.068
used to bring you backstage
after your dad's shows.

22:28.103 --> 22:29.403
I was a lot younger then.

22:29.472 --> 22:30.371
Weren't we all?

22:30.440 --> 22:31.839
[laughs]

22:31.907 --> 22:34.241
Well, I have a few things to do,
I'll let you two catch up.

22:34.276 --> 22:35.343
Nice to see you again.

22:35.378 --> 22:36.310
And you.

22:36.346 --> 22:37.277
Bye, dear.

22:37.313 --> 22:38.278
Bye.

22:39.849 --> 22:41.849
Margaret, you look amazing.

22:41.917 --> 22:43.116
Oh, stop.

22:43.152 --> 22:44.418
Ah, but then you always did.

22:44.454 --> 22:46.320
And you were always
a good actor.

22:46.356 --> 22:47.822
[laughs]

22:47.857 --> 22:50.858
So tell me, what- what on earth
are you doing here so early?

22:50.893 --> 22:52.560
The- the wedding isn't
until Christmas.

22:52.595 --> 22:54.928
Well, after I got your email
about it I-

22:54.964 --> 22:57.798
I started thinking about
James and you

22:57.834 --> 23:01.836
and how much I enjoyed
our time together back then

23:01.871 --> 23:05.606
and I realized how long
it's been since I've seen you.

23:05.641 --> 23:08.576
Oh, it's good to see you,
Tommy.

23:14.350 --> 23:18.085
When you came into my life
something changed.

23:18.120 --> 23:19.953
Things changed.

23:19.989 --> 23:20.954
Whatcha doing there?

23:20.990 --> 23:22.089
Nothing.

23:22.124 --> 23:23.223
Ok.

23:23.259 --> 23:24.759
Here, let me take that.

23:27.997 --> 23:29.229
Hmm.

23:35.170 --> 23:36.537
Miranda.

23:38.140 --> 23:40.841
I just...

23:40.877 --> 23:42.810
I just have one question for you
before you leave.

23:42.845 --> 23:44.578
Sure.

23:46.282 --> 23:50.083
How did you know that
I was Eve's daughter?

23:50.119 --> 23:52.953
It's true I had no idea Eve
had a daughter.

23:52.988 --> 23:55.589
Not until I saw the article
on the internet last Christmas

23:55.625 --> 23:57.925
about James Whitcomb.

23:57.993 --> 24:00.594
The internet. Of course.

24:00.630 --> 24:03.096
So it was the story
that brought you here.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.036
Listen, Miranda, I don't
blame you for being skeptical.

24:14.176 --> 24:16.644
You know, your mother
loved Christmas.

24:20.149 --> 24:22.182
Merry Christmas, Miranda.

24:30.225 --> 24:31.859
I really missed you, Tommy.

24:31.894 --> 24:34.127
Oh, it's just so nice
to have someone

24:34.163 --> 24:35.930
to share all these
old memories with.

24:35.965 --> 24:39.767
Yeah, I've- I've missed you,
too, Margaret.

24:39.802 --> 24:42.536
But I can't remember the last
time anyone called me Tommy.

24:42.572 --> 24:46.039
Oh. Well, that's, you know,
an old habit. Sorry.

24:46.075 --> 24:48.241
No, I- I like it.

24:48.310 --> 24:51.111
Suddenly I feel kinda...
energized.

24:54.884 --> 24:56.717
Can I get you
some more coffee?

24:56.752 --> 24:58.652
Yeah, that'd be great.

24:58.688 --> 24:59.653
Thank you.

24:59.689 --> 25:01.121
Sure.

25:09.665 --> 25:10.731
Do you believe him?

25:10.800 --> 25:11.966
No, I...

25:14.704 --> 25:16.003
I don't know.

25:22.712 --> 25:27.748
Miranda, he admitted that
he found out about you online.

25:27.783 --> 25:29.950
He saw the story about how
you came to Carlton Heath,

25:29.986 --> 25:31.418
he found out who
your father was-

25:31.453 --> 25:35.756
I know, but he also didn't
ask for anything.

25:35.791 --> 25:39.493
And he left after I asked
him to leave.

25:39.529 --> 25:44.364
I just... I got a feeling.

25:46.268 --> 25:49.403
Look, what if it's true?

25:49.471 --> 25:50.938
What if my mother didn't
tell me about him

25:50.973 --> 25:54.808
the same way she didn't tell me
about my father?

25:54.844 --> 25:57.344
What if he really is my uncle?

26:00.983 --> 26:05.586
I understand why you'd want it
to be true.

26:07.523 --> 26:09.089
What?

26:09.792 --> 26:11.825
For the first time you'd get
to hear about a part

26:11.861 --> 26:13.627
of your mother's life
that you never knew.

26:13.663 --> 26:16.530
A part of you
that you never knew.

26:16.566 --> 26:19.266
What better gift than
to open a window

26:19.301 --> 26:21.301
into that part of your world?

26:27.376 --> 26:29.443
Maybe it is too good to be true.

26:43.460 --> 26:47.028
You know, there is one thing
we haven't talked about yet.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.663
What?

26:48.731 --> 26:52.333
Well, I believe it's traditional
for the bride and groom

26:52.369 --> 26:56.103
to have the first dance
at their wedding.

26:56.173 --> 26:57.772
Oh.

26:57.807 --> 26:58.973
Yes, yes.

26:59.042 --> 27:02.377
I believe I have heard something
about this.

27:02.445 --> 27:04.111
And it occurred to me
that you and I

27:04.147 --> 27:06.047
don't do much dancing.

27:06.082 --> 27:07.882
That's true.

27:07.950 --> 27:09.651
So...

27:09.719 --> 27:11.519
So what're we doing?

27:11.555 --> 27:12.487
Wait for it.

27:12.522 --> 27:13.621
Ok.

27:17.994 --> 27:19.994
I thought we could...

27:22.432 --> 27:24.131
Practice.

that you may want to have

28:15.184 --> 28:17.518

at our house?

28:17.554 --> 28:21.522
Oh, um... we talked about it.

28:21.591 --> 28:24.992
Is that what you want to do?

28:25.027 --> 28:26.661
Um...

28:26.696 --> 28:28.129
Ok.

28:28.164 --> 28:29.764
Having been Margaret's
daughter-in-law

28:29.832 --> 28:31.165
for some time now,

28:31.200 --> 28:32.133
if you want my advice?

28:32.168 --> 28:33.501
Mmmhmm.

28:33.570 --> 28:34.736
Just be direct

28:34.771 --> 28:36.070
Direct.

28:36.139 --> 28:37.338
Yes, You may have noticed
that she's not really one

28:37.374 --> 28:38.806
to beat around the bush.

28:38.841 --> 28:40.141
[phone rings]

28:40.176 --> 28:41.676
Oh, sorry.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.979
Hi, this is Miranda.

28:46.048 --> 28:47.482
Yes, hi.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.683
Oh.

28:48.718 --> 28:50.785
Fantastic. We will be
there tomorrow.

28:50.820 --> 28:51.952
Thanks.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.390
My dress is ready.

28:55.425 --> 28:56.758
[squealing]

28:56.793 --> 28:58.826
I can't wait to see it!

29:10.440 --> 29:13.073
Alright, one week and counting
until Christmas

29:13.109 --> 29:16.778
and the wedding that we've
all been waiting for.

29:16.813 --> 29:20.315
Lydia will deliver the flowers
in the afternoon,

29:20.350 --> 29:24.319
we have our photographer and
someone to video the ceremony.

29:24.354 --> 29:26.421
You really think two cameras
is enough?

29:26.456 --> 29:27.955
Two are plenty.

29:30.360 --> 29:33.661
Ian and Andrew are getting
their tux fittings on Thursday,

29:33.697 --> 29:35.530
musicians are on stand-by.

29:35.565 --> 29:38.333
Oh, when are you two meeting
with Pastor Whalen?

29:38.368 --> 29:39.834
The day after tomorrow.

29:39.902 --> 29:41.202
Although I'm not totally sure

29:41.237 --> 29:42.903
what we're supposed
to talk to him about.

29:42.972 --> 29:44.672
Don't worry, he has a sixth
sense about these things,

29:44.708 --> 29:46.574
it'll be fine.

29:46.609 --> 29:48.142
Is everything ok in there?

29:48.177 --> 29:49.276
<i>Um...</i>

29:51.548 --> 29:52.714
Honey?

29:52.749 --> 29:54.014
Do you need some help?

29:54.050 --> 29:57.952
Uh, no, no. I'm good.
Thanks.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.721
<i>Are you ready?</i>

29:59.756 --> 30:01.589
All set.

30:01.624 --> 30:03.057
<i>Here goes.</i>

30:05.261 --> 30:06.461
Oh.

30:06.496 --> 30:07.628
Oh, Miranda.

30:07.664 --> 30:08.696
<i>What do you think?</i>

30:08.732 --> 30:11.833
You- you look absolutely
breathtaking.

30:11.868 --> 30:14.134
Beautiful. Beautiful.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.871
Oh, honey, I am so happy
for you.

30:19.275 --> 30:20.608
Thank you.

30:20.677 --> 30:22.777
And Thomas said that most of
the questions he gets

30:22.812 --> 30:25.279
from his students are still
about his work with James.

30:25.314 --> 30:26.280
Really?

30:26.349 --> 30:27.749
Wow.

30:27.817 --> 30:29.283
Yeah, we've been talking
on the phone

30:29.318 --> 30:32.253
and sharing old stories.

30:32.321 --> 30:34.756
I had forgotten
how funny he is.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.123
Hmm.

30:36.158 --> 30:37.725
Well, he sounds really nice.

30:37.761 --> 30:39.026
Mmm.

30:39.061 --> 30:41.496
Sounds like you two are
really hitting it off.

30:41.564 --> 30:43.898
What? No. No.

30:43.933 --> 30:46.000
Tommy's just a friend.

30:46.035 --> 30:47.735
[together] Tommy.

30:49.171 --> 30:50.705
Well, I would really like
to meet him.

30:50.774 --> 30:51.939
Oh, you will.

30:51.974 --> 30:53.741
No, he's coming to the wedding,
remember?

30:53.777 --> 30:55.175
Oh, of course.

30:55.211 --> 30:56.611
Oh, and speaking of that, have
you given any more thought

30:56.646 --> 31:00.815
to my idea of having
the ceremony at the house?

31:00.850 --> 31:04.786
Ian and I talked about it.

31:04.854 --> 31:06.320
At the house?

31:06.355 --> 31:07.755
Oh, Catherine,
don't you remember

31:07.791 --> 31:10.090
all those wonderful parties
that James and I had there?

31:10.126 --> 31:11.392
Yeah, no, I do.

31:11.428 --> 31:13.027
And I talked to the tent company

31:13.062 --> 31:14.495
and even on such short notice

31:14.564 --> 31:17.799
they said that it's not
a problem, they can do it.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.266
Oh.

31:19.302 --> 31:21.302
So we just have to get back
to them as soon as possible.

31:21.370 --> 31:24.972
I mean, we still have
so much to do.

31:25.007 --> 31:26.373
Yeah.

31:28.878 --> 31:33.347
Miranda, when I first met you...
no, saw you...

31:33.382 --> 31:37.217
when you first walked
into my life...

31:37.253 --> 31:40.855
In all the time I've known you
my feelings have never changed.

31:52.969 --> 31:54.569
[honking]

31:56.573 --> 31:58.138
You're back.

31:58.174 --> 31:59.474
I'm back.

31:59.542 --> 32:00.875
How'd it go with your dress?

32:00.910 --> 32:02.510
You'll just have to wait
and see.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.345
I'm looking forward to it.

32:06.415 --> 32:08.816
Have you told Margaret yet?

32:08.852 --> 32:11.151
I kinda chickened out.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.387
I just didn't know how
to tell her.

32:13.422 --> 32:15.923
Well, we'll work on it
on the way.

32:15.959 --> 32:17.424
Where are we going?

32:19.028 --> 32:21.328
The McKendrick
family tradition lives on.

32:25.368 --> 32:27.101
You're delivering baskets.

32:27.136 --> 32:28.268
Ho, ho, ho.

33:29.799 --> 33:32.833
Hey there, how'd it go?

33:32.869 --> 33:34.234
It's gonna be another great
Christmas, dad.

33:34.270 --> 33:35.502
Ah.

33:35.538 --> 33:36.671
Hey, sweetie.

33:36.706 --> 33:37.638
Oh, a package came for you.

33:37.674 --> 33:38.639
A package?

33:38.675 --> 33:39.807
Yeah. I put it in the office.

33:39.876 --> 33:41.008
Thank you.

33:41.044 --> 33:42.309
I didn't order a package.

33:42.344 --> 33:43.811
Maybe it's an early
Christmas present.

33:43.846 --> 33:46.681
Or maybe it's an early
wedding present.

34:15.712 --> 34:17.478
What is it? What'd you get?

34:20.882 --> 34:22.783
What's wrong?

34:25.054 --> 34:26.687
Who is she?

34:30.693 --> 34:32.259
My mother.

34:44.627 --> 34:45.993
Who sent these?

34:53.603 --> 34:54.534
Charles Finley.

34:54.571 --> 34:55.835
Mmmhmm.

34:57.873 --> 34:59.674
Look at this one.

35:01.877 --> 35:03.477
Look at that costume.

35:03.513 --> 35:05.646
It must have been
junior high.

35:05.715 --> 35:07.415
Her first play.

35:07.450 --> 35:08.982
She told me she only had
one line,

35:09.018 --> 35:10.318
but that was enough.

35:10.353 --> 35:13.387
She had been bitten
by the acting bug.

35:13.423 --> 35:15.189
I'm sorry you've never seen
any of these before.

35:15.258 --> 35:17.057
We travelled around so much
growing up,

35:17.093 --> 35:19.026
she didn't really hang on
to photos or keepsakes

35:19.061 --> 35:21.128
from when she was a girl.

35:21.163 --> 35:24.632
Just what she could fit
in her suitcase.

35:24.667 --> 35:31.639
She told me so many stories
but these... these make it real.

35:35.545 --> 35:37.177
I can't believe I let him go.

35:37.213 --> 35:41.148
We still don't know that Finley
is who he claims to be.

35:41.183 --> 35:43.183
How else would he have
these photos?

35:43.253 --> 35:46.019
I need to find out if
he's really my uncle

35:46.055 --> 35:48.055
and I need to know
what happened between them

35:48.124 --> 35:50.524
and why she never
told me about it.

36:19.722 --> 36:21.221
What do you think?

36:21.291 --> 36:23.257
I think it looks beautiful.

36:23.293 --> 36:25.225
I thought I'd get a jump on this
for Santa's grand entrance

36:25.261 --> 36:26.894
at the tree lighting tonight.

36:26.962 --> 36:28.429
Oh.

36:28.464 --> 36:31.632
I assume Prancer will be pulling
Santa's sleigh again this year?

36:31.668 --> 36:33.734
With bells on.

36:33.770 --> 36:35.903
Oh, I see what you did there.

36:35.938 --> 36:38.939
You know, Mrs. Claus was such
a big hit last year

36:38.974 --> 36:42.042
I was thinking she might like to
come along tonight for the ride.

36:42.077 --> 36:43.477
Hmm, were you?

36:43.513 --> 36:48.416
I mean, since she will be
the real Mrs. Claus very soon.

36:48.484 --> 36:50.284
She wouldn't miss it
for the world.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.853
Santa will be very happy
to hear that.

36:54.824 --> 36:56.156
So I tried to find
Charles Finley

36:56.192 --> 36:58.426
on the internet last night.

36:58.494 --> 37:00.461
I couldn't find anyone
by that name or description

37:00.496 --> 37:01.595
in California.

37:01.631 --> 37:02.663
Oh, no?

37:02.699 --> 37:03.864
No.

37:03.899 --> 37:07.468
Charlie, Chuck, even Chaz,
I tried them all.

37:07.503 --> 37:09.370
I just wish I knew a little more
about who he is

37:09.405 --> 37:11.238
or where exactly he lives.

37:11.307 --> 37:12.773
What his job is.

37:12.809 --> 37:14.408
Anything.

37:14.444 --> 37:17.010
Well, we'll just have
to keep looking.

37:17.046 --> 37:19.913
In the meantime I believe
we have one or two things

37:19.949 --> 37:22.650
to help keep us in
the holiday spirit.

37:22.685 --> 37:24.618
Would you mind hanging those
on the back for me?

37:40.002 --> 37:41.502
When is Santa coming?

37:41.537 --> 37:44.572
Oh, I'm sure he will be here
any minute.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.306
Margaret!

37:46.342 --> 37:47.475
Tommy?

37:47.543 --> 37:48.743
Merry Christmas.

37:48.778 --> 37:50.344
I didn't know you were
coming tonight.

37:50.380 --> 37:51.846
Well, I heard about

37:51.914 --> 37:53.547
the Christmas tree lighting
and I thought I'd check it out.

37:53.583 --> 37:56.016
Oh. Look at you
full of surprises.

37:56.051 --> 37:57.518
[laughs]

37:57.587 --> 37:59.019
You remember my son,
Peter.

37:59.054 --> 38:00.087
Yes, hi.

38:00.155 --> 38:01.221
Welcome back.

38:01.290 --> 38:02.356
His wife, Ellie.

38:02.425 --> 38:03.758
My grandchildren,
Mark and Julia.

38:03.793 --> 38:04.725
Hi.

38:04.761 --> 38:05.993
Hi.

38:06.028 --> 38:07.495
We're having some people
over to the house

38:07.530 --> 38:10.931
after the tree lighting,
hope you can join us.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.199
I don't want to intrude.

38:12.234 --> 38:15.436
Don't be silly, Tommy.
Of course you're coming.

38:15.471 --> 38:17.705
Well, how could I say
no to that?

38:19.509 --> 38:22.009
Why don't we go and get that
hot chocolate and warm up?

38:22.044 --> 38:23.176
Sounds good.

38:23.212 --> 38:24.278
Nice to meet you.

38:24.313 --> 38:25.245
Nice to see you.

38:25.281 --> 38:26.213
Bye.

38:26.248 --> 38:27.281
<i>We'll see you two later.</i>

38:27.349 --> 38:28.516
Shall we?

38:28.551 --> 38:30.518
Don't mind if I do.

38:32.054 --> 38:33.888
Oh my, look at that.

38:33.923 --> 38:35.956
<i>What a beautiful tree.</i>

38:37.427 --> 38:39.827
Merry Christmas!

38:39.862 --> 38:42.496
Merry Christmas!

38:43.633 --> 38:47.435
[applause]

38:47.904 --> 38:49.737
Merry Christmas, everybody!

38:49.772 --> 38:51.705
Merry Christmas!

38:51.774 --> 38:52.973
Ho, ho, ho.

38:53.008 --> 38:54.642
What a turn out.

39:02.051 --> 39:04.752
Merry Christmas.

39:04.787 --> 39:07.054
So good to see everyone again.

39:10.159 --> 39:11.358
Everybody ready?

39:11.393 --> 39:12.827
(All): Yes!

39:15.465 --> 39:17.030
Ten.

39:17.066 --> 39:27.808
(All): Nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

39:27.877 --> 39:33.948
[cheering]

39:37.453 --> 39:39.086
Merry Christmas!

39:39.121 --> 39:40.488
<i>Merry Christmas, Santa.</i>

39:41.858 --> 39:43.724
Merry Christmas, Julia.

39:43.759 --> 39:45.225
Merry Christmas.

39:50.199 --> 39:51.164
Hi sweetie.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.332
You see, Miranda?

39:52.368 --> 39:54.001
We hung your stocking
just like last year.

39:54.036 --> 39:55.068
I see that.

39:55.104 --> 39:56.403
Thank you so much.

39:56.438 --> 39:58.639
And after you're married
we'll put one up for Ian, too.

39:58.674 --> 40:01.408
Well, if he's a good boy.

40:03.679 --> 40:07.381
Miranda, I have someone who very
much would like to meet you.

40:07.416 --> 40:08.916
This is Thomas Reed.

40:08.985 --> 40:10.150
Thomas, Miranda.

40:10.185 --> 40:11.284
Hi.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.586
What a pleasure
to finally meet you.

40:12.622 --> 40:14.454
Your father was a very
dear friend of mine.

40:14.490 --> 40:16.289
Well, it's very nice
to meet you.

40:16.325 --> 40:17.691
Maybe later I could uh,

40:17.727 --> 40:19.960
share some wonderful stories
about him.

40:19.996 --> 40:22.129
I'd like that so much.

40:22.164 --> 40:23.230
<i>(Margaret): Come with me.</i>

40:23.265 --> 40:24.231
<i>I want you to meet
Ian's parents.</i>

40:24.266 --> 40:25.365
<i>(Thomas): Nice to meet you.</i>

40:25.401 --> 40:26.834
<i>(Miranda): You too.</i>

40:27.637 --> 40:29.102
Miranda, can I show
you something?

40:29.138 --> 40:30.504
Sure.

40:30.540 --> 40:32.439
You remember our mystery man?

40:32.474 --> 40:33.674
What about him?

40:33.743 --> 40:35.442
Turns out he wasn't just talk.

40:35.511 --> 40:36.810
I got an email from him

40:36.846 --> 40:39.013
wanting to make a donation
to the theatre.

40:39.081 --> 40:41.682
Wha- that's- wow.

40:41.717 --> 40:45.385
So his name really is Finley.

40:45.421 --> 40:46.820
Well, according to this,

40:46.856 --> 40:51.224
it's Joseph Charles Finley
of Fuller Springs, California.

40:51.260 --> 40:53.060
So Charles is his middle name.

40:53.095 --> 40:56.063
But he insists that his donation
be anonymous.

40:56.098 --> 40:58.165
He doesn't want us
to use his name.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.234
Just shows you how wrong
you can be about someone.

41:04.674 --> 41:06.306
Yes, it does.

41:19.589 --> 41:22.189
<i>(Ellie): Miranda, Ian's here.</i>

41:26.729 --> 41:30.464
Now, what about
the service itself?

41:30.532 --> 41:32.032
What do you have in mind?

41:32.068 --> 41:33.801
Well, we'd like
to keep it simple.

41:33.836 --> 41:35.736
Really just an opportunity
to include

41:35.771 --> 41:37.871
our friends and family
in our celebration.

41:37.907 --> 41:39.372
Um, we've written our own vows.

41:39.441 --> 41:40.808
<i>How's that going?</i>

41:40.876 --> 41:42.009
Good. All done.

41:42.511 --> 41:44.478
Really?

41:44.513 --> 41:45.779
Aren't you?

41:45.815 --> 41:49.149
Yeah. I mean, practically.

41:49.184 --> 41:51.719
I have some tweaking
to do, but yeah.

41:51.754 --> 41:52.853
Good.

41:54.690 --> 41:58.425
I understand from Margaret
there may be a change in venue?

41:58.460 --> 42:01.996
The Whitcomb home
instead of your cottage?

42:02.031 --> 42:06.834
Well, we haven't exactly
decided yet.

42:06.869 --> 42:08.936
Christmas is in four days.

42:08.971 --> 42:12.673
And it's at the top of our list.

42:12.708 --> 42:14.374
What about family?

42:14.409 --> 42:16.543
Is everyone on board
with the marriage?

42:16.578 --> 42:19.312
Any issues you'd like
to talk over?

42:19.348 --> 42:21.214
My parents absolutely
love Miranda.

42:21.250 --> 42:22.716
They can't wait for us
to be married.

42:22.785 --> 42:24.151
That's what I like to hear.

42:24.186 --> 42:25.953
Miranda?

42:26.022 --> 42:29.056
Um, Ian and I haven't really
talked about it yet

42:29.125 --> 42:32.893
but I've been thinking
and there is someone else

42:32.928 --> 42:35.262
I'd like to invite
to the wedding.

42:35.297 --> 42:37.364
A family member?

42:37.399 --> 42:39.133
Um, maybe.

42:39.168 --> 42:41.434
I'm- I'm actually not sure yet.

42:41.470 --> 42:44.038
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

42:44.073 --> 42:45.338
(whispering): You didn't tell me
that you wanted

42:45.374 --> 42:46.774
to invite him to our wedding.

42:46.809 --> 42:48.275
I just thought about it
on the way over here.

42:48.310 --> 42:49.543
You don't know anything
about him.

42:49.578 --> 42:51.311
I know, but I would talk
to him first

42:51.346 --> 42:54.581
to make sure before I invited
him to the wedding.

42:54.616 --> 42:57.685
Ian, is there something
you'd like to say to Miranda?

42:57.753 --> 43:01.655
Miranda grew up not knowing
who her family was.

43:01.691 --> 43:04.324
Now that she does it means
everything to her.

43:06.395 --> 43:10.597
All I want is for her to be
happy on our wedding day.

43:27.705 --> 43:28.871
I like him.

43:28.907 --> 43:31.507
Me too.
Good guy.

43:31.543 --> 43:32.508
Yeah.

43:34.579 --> 43:36.279
Thank you for what you said
about inviting Charles

43:36.315 --> 43:37.480
to the wedding.

43:37.515 --> 43:39.582
Sure. Joseph.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.850
What?

43:40.885 --> 43:42.819
His real name is Joseph Finley,

43:42.854 --> 43:48.624
which he forgot to mention
when he met you, apparently.

43:48.660 --> 43:52.162
You think inviting him
is a mistake.

43:53.865 --> 43:55.398
I meant what I said.

43:55.434 --> 43:57.033
I want you to be happy.

43:57.069 --> 43:58.768
I know, but there was more
you wanted to say

43:58.803 --> 44:00.403
when Pastor Whalen asked.

44:00.439 --> 44:01.771
What if you're wrong?

44:01.806 --> 44:03.539
What if he's just some guy
who's in this for himself?

44:03.575 --> 44:05.976
Who thinks he can get something
out of it?

44:06.011 --> 44:07.877
I don't believe that's true.

44:07.912 --> 44:10.780
What if it is?
What then?

44:10.815 --> 44:14.417
I told you, I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt you

44:14.486 --> 44:16.186
and I'm worried about
what this might do to you,

44:16.254 --> 44:18.554
and to this day that means
so much to us.

44:18.590 --> 44:19.722
Ian...

44:22.027 --> 44:25.895
Look, when I came to Carlton
Heath two years ago

44:25.964 --> 44:29.199
I was looking for my family
and no one believed me...

44:29.234 --> 44:31.234
except you.

44:31.303 --> 44:34.270
And if you hadn't I never
would have had the chance

44:34.306 --> 44:38.008
to prove that my story was true
and we wouldn't be

44:38.043 --> 44:40.443
about to start
our lives together.

44:43.181 --> 44:47.384
If there is even the slightest
chance that his story is true,

44:47.419 --> 44:49.152
that he's just trying
to find his family

44:49.187 --> 44:52.889
the same way I was trying
to find mine,

44:52.924 --> 44:55.758
shouldn't I give him
that chance?

45:00.298 --> 45:02.065
I hope you're right.

45:06.804 --> 45:08.604
Me too.

45:18.150 --> 45:19.516
[knocking]

45:19.551 --> 45:20.750
Come in.

45:25.524 --> 45:28.024
I'm not supposed
to wake you up.

45:28.060 --> 45:30.160
It's alright, sweetie.
I'm already awake.

45:30.228 --> 45:31.694
Can I ask you something?

45:31.729 --> 45:32.995
Of course.

45:35.934 --> 45:38.734
Everybody else is busy with work
and shopping and stuff

45:38.803 --> 45:40.803
and Mark is going sledding
with his friends.

45:40.838 --> 45:42.072
Uh-huh.

45:42.107 --> 45:44.174
But I really wanna bake
Christmas cookies

45:44.209 --> 45:46.642
and mom says I'm not old enough
to do it by myself,

45:46.711 --> 45:48.411
even though I totally could.

45:48.447 --> 45:49.946
Lots of times,
even when she's there,

45:49.981 --> 45:52.482
I do everything anyway and she
doesn't even have to help me.

45:52.551 --> 45:56.852
Julia, I would love to make
Christmas cookies with you.

45:56.921 --> 45:57.954
Really?

45:57.989 --> 45:59.189
Mmmhmm.

45:59.224 --> 46:00.523
Just let me get dressed.
I'll meet you out there.

46:00.559 --> 46:01.991
Thank you, Auntie Miranda.

46:02.026 --> 46:03.426
[laughs]

46:07.699 --> 46:10.700
You know, I was thinking
about it,

46:10.735 --> 46:13.903
that the last time you wore
a tux you must have been

46:13.938 --> 46:15.605
in high school, right?

46:15.673 --> 46:18.674
<i>Senior prom under protest.</i>

46:18.710 --> 46:20.310
What're you talking about?

46:20.378 --> 46:22.878
Everybody wears a tux to prom.

46:22.914 --> 46:25.448
<i>It doesn't mean
you have to like it.</i>

46:25.484 --> 46:28.618
It's a special occasion.
One of life's moments.

46:28.653 --> 46:30.653
Like getting married.

46:30.722 --> 46:32.422
Well, the getting married part
is great

46:32.457 --> 46:35.525
but does the bow tie have
to cut off my air supply?

46:35.594 --> 46:37.127
You look like a million bucks.

46:37.195 --> 46:38.694
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:40.465 --> 46:43.566
Oh, hey, we've come up
with a new floor plan.

46:43.602 --> 46:45.034
If we rearrange the dining room

46:45.069 --> 46:46.469
there'll be plenty of room
for everybody.

46:46.505 --> 46:47.770
You don't have to do that.

46:47.805 --> 46:50.140
Are you kidding?
We're having a blast.

46:50.175 --> 46:53.576
You just let us know if there's
anything else you need.

46:53.612 --> 46:56.712
How are you
with wedding vows?

46:56.781 --> 46:58.914
Stuck, are you?

46:58.950 --> 47:00.416
I know what I wanna say.

47:00.452 --> 47:01.751
I know the words to say it,

47:01.819 --> 47:03.653
I just can't seem to get them
in the right order.

47:03.688 --> 47:05.121
And there's just been
so many distractions

47:05.157 --> 47:06.489
over the last couple of days...

47:06.525 --> 47:07.823
That's normal.

47:07.859 --> 47:09.959
You're both busy,
got so much to do.

47:09.994 --> 47:12.094
This is different.

47:12.164 --> 47:14.464
You wanna talk about it?

47:14.499 --> 47:17.200
I think Miranda and I need
to work it out.

47:17.235 --> 47:20.102
She's just been through so much
over the last two years.

47:20.138 --> 47:25.007
I really wanted this to be...
simple for her.

47:25.043 --> 47:29.579
Well, whatever's going on son,
simple or not,

47:29.648 --> 47:32.948
I'm sure that you and Miranda
will work it out.

47:32.984 --> 47:35.685
'Cause that's what a vow is,
right?

47:35.720 --> 47:38.621
It's a promise from the heart
to somebody you love

47:38.690 --> 47:42.792
that no matter what
you'll always be there.

47:42.827 --> 47:44.927
And from what I can see,

47:44.962 --> 47:48.831
you and Miranda took that vow
a long time ago.

47:48.900 --> 47:51.401
I am so proud of you, son.

47:54.972 --> 47:56.206
Thanks, dad.

47:59.077 --> 48:00.810
I still can't breathe.

48:04.816 --> 48:06.749
[laughs]

48:06.784 --> 48:07.850
Miranda?

48:07.885 --> 48:09.118
Mmmhmm?

48:09.153 --> 48:10.286
Were you ever flower girl
at a wedding?

48:10.322 --> 48:13.223
Mmmhmm. When I was
about your age.

48:13.258 --> 48:15.358
Were you ever kind of
nervous about,

48:15.427 --> 48:18.428
you know, doing it wrong?

48:18.496 --> 48:22.064
Maybe a little,
but you know what?

48:22.100 --> 48:23.566
What?

48:23.602 --> 48:27.270
I remembered that out of all
the little girls in the world

48:27.305 --> 48:29.372
the bride had chosen me
to throw the petals

48:29.407 --> 48:33.476
for her to walk down the aisle,
just like I chose you.

48:33.511 --> 48:37.447
And I am sure you are going
to do a wonderful job.

48:37.482 --> 48:38.648
I can't wait.

48:38.683 --> 48:40.250
Neither can I.

48:40.285 --> 48:42.619
Well, what do you think?

48:42.654 --> 48:43.919
I think they're ready.

48:43.955 --> 48:45.521
I do, too.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.960
That's the angel bracelet
that Ian gave to you

48:51.028 --> 48:52.895
the first Christmas
you were here.

48:52.964 --> 48:55.398
Yes.

48:55.433 --> 48:57.066
Yes, it is.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.701
It's very pretty.

48:58.737 --> 49:03.573
Sometimes, when I look at it
and I think very hard about Ian

49:03.608 --> 49:04.974
and just how much he means
to me-

49:05.009 --> 49:06.676
[phone buzzes]

49:09.981 --> 49:11.347
[laughs]

49:16.187 --> 49:18.254
Your timing is incredible.

49:18.290 --> 49:19.922
<i>What'd I do?</i>

49:19.991 --> 49:22.825
Oh, just made Julia and me
believe in Christmas magic.

49:22.860 --> 49:24.226
With one phone call?

49:24.262 --> 49:25.328
Not bad.

49:25.363 --> 49:26.329
[giggles]

49:26.364 --> 49:27.463
Where are you?

49:27.499 --> 49:29.064
I just finished getting my tux.

49:29.100 --> 49:31.033
<i>Oh! How'd it go?</i>

49:31.068 --> 49:33.536
I guess you'll just have
to wait and see.

49:33.605 --> 49:37.307
Sounds like we both have
something to look forward to.

49:37.342 --> 49:39.108
Listen, about yesterday,

49:39.143 --> 49:41.311
I think sometimes
I worry too much.

49:41.346 --> 49:44.146
No, I think you worry
just the right amount.

49:44.182 --> 49:46.081
So you're ok?

49:46.117 --> 49:48.884
Hey, we're getting married
in three days.

49:48.920 --> 49:52.121
<i>I'm a lot more than ok.</i>

49:52.156 --> 49:53.489
I'm gonna head over
to the theatre,

49:53.525 --> 49:54.724
help dad out with rehearsal.

49:54.793 --> 49:56.559
Why don't you come by later?

49:56.594 --> 49:57.727
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

49:57.762 --> 49:59.028
I love you.

49:59.063 --> 50:00.496
I love you, too.

50:03.034 --> 50:04.834
Oh, you little sneak!

50:04.869 --> 50:06.869
You are in trouble, missy!

50:06.938 --> 50:07.970
[laughs]

50:10.710 --> 50:12.242
Margaret.

50:12.278 --> 50:13.577
Oh, hello, Ian.

50:13.613 --> 50:15.413
How's it going in there?

50:15.481 --> 50:16.847
Good. Good.

50:16.916 --> 50:19.717
No, your father seems more
than ready to be back on stage.

50:19.752 --> 50:21.151
No kidding.

50:21.187 --> 50:22.353
Well, I better get in there,

50:22.422 --> 50:24.288
make sure he doesn't chew up
the scenery.

50:24.357 --> 50:27.391
Oh, Ian, uh, did Miranda mention
that she met Thomas Reed

50:27.427 --> 50:28.826
at the party last night?

50:28.894 --> 50:30.561
Yeah, she told me about that.

50:30.596 --> 50:32.530
He so enjoyed talking to her.

50:32.565 --> 50:38.869
Gosh, I have known Tommy for,
what, 40 years now?

50:38.938 --> 50:40.871
He was always such a good friend
to James and me

50:40.906 --> 50:45.643
but now that it's just
the two of us it feels...

50:45.678 --> 50:47.378
it feels strange.

50:47.413 --> 50:49.847
Well, Miranda said he seems like
a really nice guy.

50:53.085 --> 50:55.453
You knew, didn't you?

50:55.488 --> 50:57.254
When you met Miranda
two Christmases ago,

50:57.289 --> 50:59.590
you knew how you felt
about her.

50:59.659 --> 51:01.158
Yeah, I guess I figured out
pretty quick

51:01.193 --> 51:02.593
that I wanted to be with her.

51:02.628 --> 51:04.027
Yeah, I could tell.

51:04.063 --> 51:06.530
I remember thinking how
extraordinary it was that,

51:06.599 --> 51:08.399
despite everything,
all the obstacles

51:08.434 --> 51:12.002
that stood between
you and Miranda, you...

51:12.037 --> 51:17.441
you always stayed true to your
feelings and you found a way.

51:17.477 --> 51:19.910
Here you are,
about to be married.

51:19.945 --> 51:22.480
Here we are.
I'm a lucky guy.

51:22.515 --> 51:25.383
No, no. Luck had nothing
to do with it.

51:25.418 --> 51:28.619
You fell in love and you
were fearless with your love.

51:30.890 --> 51:32.823
That's uh... thank you.

51:39.599 --> 51:41.766
It's just been so long.

51:44.003 --> 51:49.206
Margaret, I'm no expert, but you
said you and Thomas are friends.

51:49.241 --> 51:50.474
That seems like a pretty
good place

51:50.510 --> 51:52.476
for two people to start out.

51:55.047 --> 51:58.282
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

51:58.317 --> 52:00.350
Thank you.

52:33.453 --> 52:36.487
[phone rings]

52:38.357 --> 52:39.590
Merry Christmas,
thanks for calling

52:39.659 --> 52:41.024
Grace Fellowship Church,
this is Nicole,

52:41.060 --> 52:42.993
<i>how may I help you?</i>

52:43.062 --> 52:46.029
Hi, um... I hope I have
the right number.

52:46.065 --> 52:49.700
I was um, I'm just trying
to reach Charl-

52:49.735 --> 52:51.635
I'm trying to reach
Joseph Finley.

52:51.671 --> 52:54.638
Oh, I'm sorry, Pastor Finley
is off until the holidays.

52:56.809 --> 52:58.308
Pastor Finley?

52:58.344 --> 53:01.111
Yes, that's right.

53:01.180 --> 53:03.681
I'm just curious, how long
has he been a pastor there?

53:03.749 --> 53:06.249
<i>Oh, gosh, 20 years?</i>

53:06.285 --> 53:08.886
Yeah, he's become quite
the fixture around here.

53:08.955 --> 53:11.455
We're all very fond
of Pastor Charlie.

53:13.192 --> 53:14.758
I thought Charles was
his middle name.

53:14.794 --> 53:17.127
<i>Uh, everyone's been calling
him Pastor Charlie for,</i>

53:17.196 --> 53:18.829
<i>like, forever.</i>

53:20.900 --> 53:24.234
Is there um- do you-
do you have a cell number

53:24.303 --> 53:25.268
where I could reach him?

53:25.304 --> 53:26.470
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

53:26.506 --> 53:29.072
But he does check in sometimes
for messages.

53:32.678 --> 53:34.344
Could you please tell him
that Miranda called?

53:34.380 --> 53:36.446
<i>Miranda, sure.
Merry Christmas, Miranda.</i>

53:36.482 --> 53:38.616
Thank you.

53:47.527 --> 53:48.458
He's a pastor?

53:48.494 --> 53:49.994
Mmmhmm.

53:50.029 --> 53:53.497
Has been for years at the same
church in Northern California.

53:56.602 --> 53:58.068
I don't understand.

53:58.137 --> 53:59.803
Why wouldn't he just
tell you that?

53:59.839 --> 54:01.605
I don't know.

54:01.641 --> 54:05.042
But he came here at Christmas,
Ian, and...

54:05.077 --> 54:07.177
and it was to find me.

54:07.212 --> 54:09.079
Someone he believed
was his family,

54:09.148 --> 54:12.282
and I... I didn't listen.

54:12.317 --> 54:16.420
Well, that's- that's not...
no one would expect you

54:16.455 --> 54:19.690
to just open your arms and
welcome him into the family.

54:21.594 --> 54:26.664
The way everyone opened
their arms to me?

54:26.699 --> 54:28.799
Tell me what you wanna do.

54:32.471 --> 54:35.372
I want to marry you
at Christmas.

54:36.909 --> 54:41.011
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

54:41.047 --> 54:42.846
And I need to find him.

54:42.882 --> 54:46.750
I just... I need to know.

54:48.120 --> 54:50.487
Ok. I think we should do
all of the above,

54:50.556 --> 54:51.922
but first let's get out
of the cold.

54:51.958 --> 54:53.256
Ok.

54:53.325 --> 54:54.291
Ok.

54:56.261 --> 54:57.527
Hello?

54:57.563 --> 54:59.329
Oh, hi Miranda.

54:59.364 --> 55:00.864
You two look busy.

55:00.933 --> 55:02.566
Uh, we sent Peter on an errand
with the kids

55:02.602 --> 55:05.002
so we could finally get some
Christmas wrapping done.

55:05.037 --> 55:06.336
Oh.

55:06.371 --> 55:07.771
Why don't you sit down
and join us?

55:07.807 --> 55:10.173
Thank you, but I'm actually
feeling a little tired.

55:10.209 --> 55:12.810
I think I'm just gonna head
to my room.

55:12.845 --> 55:14.011
Wait, you're not getting sick

55:14.046 --> 55:15.646
right before your wedding,
are you?

55:15.681 --> 55:17.615
It was just a busy day.

55:17.650 --> 55:18.983
Ok.

55:19.051 --> 55:20.751
But let us know if
you need anything.

55:20.820 --> 55:22.653
I will. Goodnight.

55:22.688 --> 55:24.254
Goodnight.

55:24.289 --> 55:27.524
Oh, uh, Miranda, I- I spoke
with that tent company again.

55:27.559 --> 55:30.427
They tell me they hadn't
heard from you.

55:30.462 --> 55:32.162
No.

55:32.197 --> 55:33.964
Well, we don't have
a lot of time left

55:34.000 --> 55:35.933
so you really should
speak to them.

55:35.968 --> 55:37.868
Margaret...

55:37.903 --> 55:39.336
You know what?

55:39.371 --> 55:43.674
I'm gonna run and just go
get some tape from the office.

55:51.316 --> 55:55.719
Margaret, I so appreciate
everything you've done

55:55.788 --> 55:57.454
to help plan this wedding.

55:57.489 --> 56:00.257
Ian and I both do.

56:00.325 --> 56:04.528
But... we want to be married
at the cottage.

56:04.563 --> 56:06.697
Oh, but there are
so many people.

56:06.732 --> 56:11.869
I know, but... the cottage has
just been a part of this family

56:11.904 --> 56:16.373
for so long and that makes
it mean even more to me.

56:16.408 --> 56:20.544
There's really nowhere we'd
rather start our lives together.

56:20.579 --> 56:24.247
And being there, it just...

56:24.283 --> 56:26.784
it makes me feel closer
to my father

56:26.852 --> 56:29.787
even though he won't be there
to walk me down the aisle.

56:32.658 --> 56:38.528
Of course, I... I just didn't
know that you felt that way.

56:38.564 --> 56:40.798
Thank you for understanding.

56:44.170 --> 56:45.302
Goodnight.

56:46.105 --> 56:47.171
Goodnight.

56:59.852 --> 57:00.918
[knocking]

57:00.986 --> 57:02.519
Come in.

57:02.554 --> 57:03.754
Miranda.

57:03.789 --> 57:05.122
Hi.

57:05.191 --> 57:07.057
Um, forgive the intrusion.

57:07.093 --> 57:09.827
Um, I just wanted to apologize.

57:09.895 --> 57:12.963
What you said about the cottage,
I should have realized.

57:12.998 --> 57:17.201
I'm afraid I've just been
a little distracted lately.

57:17.236 --> 57:19.369
It's alright, really.

57:19.438 --> 57:22.606
But now that I know we will
make this right,

57:22.674 --> 57:24.341
I promise you.

57:24.376 --> 57:25.976
Thank you.

57:27.412 --> 57:30.313
<i>Oh, what a cute girl.
Who is that?</i>

57:32.985 --> 57:35.853
That's my mother.

57:35.888 --> 57:37.420
In high school.

57:37.456 --> 57:39.823
Every Christmas she worked
at the mall.

57:41.761 --> 57:44.228
Miranda?

57:44.263 --> 57:48.098
I just haven't seen any of these
photos until a few days ago.

57:48.134 --> 57:50.234
Where did they come from?

57:53.906 --> 57:55.538
My uncle.

57:58.043 --> 58:00.410
I- I'm sorry, I don't
understand.

58:00.445 --> 58:03.147
I thought you told me that
your mother had no siblings.

58:03.182 --> 58:05.615
That's what I thought.

58:05.651 --> 58:10.154
I first met him in Boston
and then he- he came here

58:10.189 --> 58:16.226
to tell me who he was and...
and he sent me those photos.

58:16.262 --> 58:18.262
So you knew nothing
about this man

58:18.297 --> 58:20.463
and your mother never mentioned
she had a brother?

58:20.499 --> 58:21.832
No.

58:29.441 --> 58:31.608
I just wish that you had felt

58:31.643 --> 58:33.343
that you could have come
to me about this.

58:33.378 --> 58:36.313
I wanted to, I just didn't...

58:36.348 --> 58:38.682
You didn't what?

58:38.717 --> 58:41.218
You've seemed so happy
with Thomas

58:41.253 --> 58:44.487
and I didn't want you to have
to worry about any of this.

58:53.999 --> 58:56.120
Still haven't heard from Finley?

58:57.809 --> 59:00.243
Did I do the right thing
telling Margaret about him?

59:00.278 --> 59:02.178
Of course.

59:02.214 --> 59:04.214
I could just see how concerned
she was that this was gonna

59:04.282 --> 59:08.651
affect the family and that's-
that's the last thing I want.

59:08.686 --> 59:10.353
I know that, love.

59:10.422 --> 59:12.222
And after Margaret has had
some time to think about it

59:12.257 --> 59:15.191
she'll understand that, too.

59:15.227 --> 59:17.793
I hope you're right.

59:17.862 --> 59:19.195
Have you ever asked yourself

59:19.231 --> 59:21.931
why your mother kept
these secrets from you?

59:21.966 --> 59:25.368
I think she was just trying to
protect me from getting hurt.

59:25.403 --> 59:27.203
I think so, too.

59:27.272 --> 59:28.938
Kinda like you.

59:28.973 --> 59:30.573
The first time you came here
you were ready to leave

59:30.642 --> 59:32.142
without telling anyone
who you were.

59:32.177 --> 59:33.776
You were gonna keep it a secret.

59:33.811 --> 59:35.512
But I stayed because of you.

59:35.547 --> 59:39.415
No. You stayed because of you.

59:39.451 --> 59:42.452
You're so much stronger than
you give yourself credit for.

59:42.487 --> 59:44.120
You don't need to keep secrets
to protect yourself,

59:44.156 --> 59:46.589
or anyone else,
for that matter.

59:53.998 --> 59:58.168
Ah, Peter told me
you'd be here.

59:58.203 --> 59:59.636
Am I interrupting?

59:59.671 --> 01:00:02.138
Thomas, I didn't think I'd see
you until tomorrow.

01:00:02.207 --> 01:00:05.007
Well, I had this sudden urge
to be roasting chestnuts

01:00:05.043 --> 01:00:07.743
over an open fire,
like in the song.

01:00:07.779 --> 01:00:09.579
Well, what a nice surprise.

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:11.814
I also heard there's
a performance tonight

01:00:11.849 --> 01:00:14.717
of a certain Dickens classic.

01:00:14.752 --> 01:00:16.852
I thought we might get a bite
to eat and see it together.

01:00:16.921 --> 01:00:19.355
Uh, my grandchildren
are in the show

01:00:19.391 --> 01:00:21.524
and I always go
with Peter and Ellie.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.826
But of course you're welcome
to join us.

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:27.530
Sounds like I should
have called first.

01:00:27.566 --> 01:00:28.931
I'm sorry.

01:00:28.966 --> 01:00:30.900
No, you have no reason
to apologize.

01:00:30.935 --> 01:00:34.837
I've enjoyed our time together
as much as you have.

01:00:34.906 --> 01:00:37.507
No, it's I who should apologize.

01:00:40.144 --> 01:00:42.178
What're you talking about?

01:00:42.214 --> 01:00:45.348
Well, I just realized that,
uh, I've allowed myself

01:00:45.417 --> 01:00:48.150
to become distracted and there's
just so much going on

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:51.387
so I feel that I should just
take a step back

01:00:51.423 --> 01:00:56.292
and focus on my family.

01:00:56.328 --> 01:01:01.664
I think your family's doing
just fine, Margaret.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:06.502
Maybe it's time to focus
on yourself a little bit.

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:08.504
Who knows what
might happen?

01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:27.323
<i>[bells tolling]</i>

01:01:27.359 --> 01:01:31.127
Wow, that looks great.

01:01:31.162 --> 01:01:33.396
There you go.

01:01:47.279 --> 01:01:48.745
Mr. Finley?

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:52.081
Oh, Miranda. Hi.

01:01:52.116 --> 01:01:55.951
I was just on my way to come
and find you but...

01:01:55.987 --> 01:01:57.787
I've never been able
to resist church bells,

01:01:57.822 --> 01:01:59.389
especially at Christmas.

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:00.856
You got my message.

01:02:00.892 --> 01:02:04.059
Yeah. And you got
those pictures of Eve?

01:02:06.898 --> 01:02:10.466
Why didn't you tell me that you
were the pastor of your church?

01:02:10.535 --> 01:02:12.067
I thought about
how it would sound,

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.170
me coming here asking
for your trust

01:02:14.205 --> 01:02:16.138
and then saying I was
a man of the cloth.

01:02:16.207 --> 01:02:18.207
Might have just been a little
too convenient,

01:02:18.242 --> 01:02:20.109
don't you think?

01:02:20.144 --> 01:02:21.744
Probably.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.081
Anyway, I figured no matter
what I said

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:27.283
you're gonna have to make up
your own mind

01:02:27.352 --> 01:02:29.352
whether to believe me or not.

01:02:31.923 --> 01:02:33.856
Ah, so beautiful.

01:02:35.493 --> 01:02:41.197
<i>[bells tolling]</i>

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.934
When I saw mom's photos
they reminded me

01:02:45.002 --> 01:02:47.670
so much of all the stories she
told me about her childhood.

01:02:47.706 --> 01:02:49.305
[laughs]

01:02:49.374 --> 01:02:53.242
She was a real firecracker,
your mom.

01:02:53.277 --> 01:02:55.745
Nothing slowed her down.

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.013
But she never told me
about you.

01:03:00.952 --> 01:03:03.720
Well, it's not what
she wanted.

01:03:06.358 --> 01:03:07.890
What happened?

01:03:10.094 --> 01:03:14.296
When I went to see her
in the Tempest I was uh...

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:17.933
a young pastor in my very
first church

01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:22.204
and I was so certain about
right and wrong.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.740
Everything was black and white.

01:03:23.775 --> 01:03:29.111
There was no room for grey
or doubt or...

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:35.418
Anyway, she introduced me after
the show to James Whitcomb

01:03:35.487 --> 01:03:38.320
and they were so much in love.

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:40.222
Everyone could see it.

01:03:40.258 --> 01:03:44.326
But then I found out that he was
still in the middle

01:03:44.396 --> 01:03:53.636
of his divorce and that was just
simply not acceptable to me.

01:03:53.671 --> 01:03:57.840
I told her so in so many words.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:04:00.476
I said some things
that night that...

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:06.649
What did she say?

01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:10.185
Well, she was stunned.
She was hurt.

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:15.124
She hugged me, hard,
told me she loved me.

01:04:18.696 --> 01:04:20.863
I never spoke to her again.

01:04:24.669 --> 01:04:28.838
She never told you about me?

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:31.507
I never gave her
the chance.

01:04:31.543 --> 01:04:33.976
What do you mean?

01:04:34.011 --> 01:04:38.514
When she phoned
a few months later

01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:42.251
and I was still so sure of how
things should be in the world.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.555
I was so arrogant.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.825
I never picked up the phone.

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.294
And then, ultimately of course,
the phone stopped ringing.

01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:57.433
I realize now that she was-

01:04:57.469 --> 01:04:59.669
she was trying to tell me
about you.

01:04:59.704 --> 01:05:03.606
She was reaching out to me,
her brother, for help

01:05:03.675 --> 01:05:05.307
and I just wasn't there
for her.

01:05:05.343 --> 01:05:07.343
You didn't know.

01:05:07.411 --> 01:05:08.644
Yeah.

01:05:08.713 --> 01:05:11.814
I've told myself
that a thousand times.

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:13.415
It doesn't matter.

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:15.017
She was family.

01:05:15.052 --> 01:05:18.253
I should have been there
for her no matter what.

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:20.356
Did you even know how
to reach her?

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:26.161
I mean, she moved around
so much at that time

01:05:26.197 --> 01:05:29.665
I uh, I lost track of Eve.

01:05:34.038 --> 01:05:36.372
And then I found out

01:05:36.407 --> 01:05:42.745
she had a beautiful daughter
named Miranda,

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.347
and all I want now is
to tell you how sorry I am

01:05:45.383 --> 01:05:48.117
that I was never there
for you, either.

01:05:53.257 --> 01:05:56.626
I am very glad you're here now.

01:06:02.934 --> 01:06:04.433
Well, I- I should get going.

01:06:04.468 --> 01:06:05.902
It's almost Christmas,

01:06:05.937 --> 01:06:08.437
you must have a million things
to do before the wedding.

01:06:08.472 --> 01:06:10.773
There's someone I'd really
like you to meet.

01:06:19.316 --> 01:06:20.616
Are you sure?

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:23.853
Very much.

01:06:38.822 --> 01:06:41.456
<i>(Announcement): The show will
begin in two minutes,</i>

01:06:41.491 --> 01:06:44.259
<i>please take your seats.
That's two minutes.</i>

01:06:45.228 --> 01:06:46.828
I was just calling you.
The show's about to begin.

01:06:46.864 --> 01:06:48.196
Sorry we're late.

01:06:48.265 --> 01:06:52.333
Ian, I'd like you to meet
Charles Finley, my uncle.

01:06:52.369 --> 01:06:54.002
It's a great pleasure
to meet you, Ian.

01:06:54.038 --> 01:06:55.971
And congratulations
on the upcoming wedding.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.172
Nice to meet you, too.

01:06:57.207 --> 01:06:58.473
It's a pleasure.

01:06:58.508 --> 01:06:59.942
Think we can find an extra seat
in there?

01:06:59.977 --> 01:07:01.076
Yeah, of course.

01:07:01.111 --> 01:07:02.578
Thank you.

01:07:04.715 --> 01:07:06.748
There isn't doubt
but ever about that.

01:07:06.784 --> 01:07:09.384
<i>And scrooge's name was
good upon change for anything...</i>

01:07:09.453 --> 01:07:11.252
[crowd laughing]

01:07:13.256 --> 01:07:14.189
[laughter]

01:07:14.224 --> 01:07:16.858
God bless us, everyone.

01:07:16.894 --> 01:07:22.263
[applause]

01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:28.971
Have you seen this weather
report for Christmas Eve?

01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:30.371
Hmm?

01:07:30.407 --> 01:07:33.308
It looks like there's
a front moving in.

01:07:33.343 --> 01:07:35.543
Good. Looks like we'll have
a white Christmas.

01:07:35.579 --> 01:07:36.745
Hmm.

01:07:38.682 --> 01:07:40.248
Oh, and a white wedding.

01:07:40.283 --> 01:07:41.717
[chuckles]

01:07:41.752 --> 01:07:43.619
White wedding.
That's good.

01:08:15.152 --> 01:08:17.484
Listen, we're taking the kids
for hot chocolate.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.121
Why don't you join us?

01:08:19.156 --> 01:08:22.390
Uh... I don't think so.
I have a lot to do here.

01:08:22.459 --> 01:08:24.059
But you go ahead.

01:08:26.263 --> 01:08:28.595
I was surprised I didn't see
Thomas Reed

01:08:28.631 --> 01:08:30.598
at the show last night.

01:08:30.634 --> 01:08:33.600
You two seemed to really
hit it off.

01:08:33.636 --> 01:08:37.706
Peter, I have known Thomas
most of my life

01:08:37.741 --> 01:08:43.111
and we did not hit it off,
he's... he's just a good friend.

01:08:43.147 --> 01:08:46.081
And a really nice guy who
I think would like to spend

01:08:46.116 --> 01:08:48.448
Christmas with you.

01:08:48.484 --> 01:08:52.554
And who makes you smile in a way
I haven't seen in a long time.

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:55.390
Just saying.

01:09:05.502 --> 01:09:08.303
So tomorrow morning we are
opening presents very early

01:09:08.337 --> 01:09:11.006
with the kids and then
we're having a quick breakfast

01:09:11.041 --> 01:09:13.008
before Ian and I have to start
getting ready,

01:09:13.042 --> 01:09:15.077
so you should just plan
on coming over to the house.

01:09:15.112 --> 01:09:18.747
You're so kind to invite me
for Christmas and the wedding,

01:09:18.782 --> 01:09:23.018
but um... this is your
family here.

01:09:23.053 --> 01:09:26.154
This- this is your home.

01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:28.990
This is where you and Ian
are gonna start

01:09:29.026 --> 01:09:30.558
to build a life together.

01:09:30.594 --> 01:09:34.395
This is a time when you should
be with people you're close to.

01:09:34.464 --> 01:09:35.764
People you love.

01:09:35.799 --> 01:09:39.334
And I would- I would never want
to intrude on that.

01:09:39.368 --> 01:09:43.238
But I have so many more stories
to tell you about your mother,

01:09:43.273 --> 01:09:47.475
so believe me, we'll be together
again very, very soon.

01:09:50.046 --> 01:09:52.781
Merry Christmas, Miranda.

01:09:52.816 --> 01:09:55.583
Merry Christmas,
Uncle Charlie.

01:10:16.039 --> 01:10:17.839
I don't want you to...

01:10:17.875 --> 01:10:21.276
No, that's no good.
Anyway.
