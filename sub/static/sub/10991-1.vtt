WEBVTT

00:00.051 --> 00:03.054
Snowdrop, Stripes, Fluffy...

00:03.137 --> 00:06.391
and Ginger, there's Spot, <i>Whiskers...</i>

00:07.392 --> 00:09.352
I don't think so, dear.

00:09.644 --> 00:13.273
What do we do before we eat?
We wash our hands, young lady.

00:13.356 --> 00:15.275
Hygiene.

00:16.568 --> 00:17.569
Go on.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.654
It's down there.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

01:11.497 --> 01:13.499
The MirrorMask.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.961
He used to talk about it, of course.

01:17.462 --> 01:21.382
My husband, the late Mr. Bagwell.

01:21.758 --> 01:24.010
Fluffy, don't do that!

01:26.638 --> 01:30.058
Mr. Bagwell used to say that...

01:30.600 --> 01:34.687
the MirrorMask concentrated your desires...

01:34.812 --> 01:36.022
your wishes.

01:36.481 --> 01:39.025
It gave you what you needed.

01:39.817 --> 01:41.778
I remember I said to him...

01:41.819 --> 01:45.406
"Mr. Bagwell,
how can a mask know what you need?"

01:45.823 --> 01:46.950
And he said...

01:47.075 --> 01:51.704
"Cynthia, remember,
I don't know what I'm talking about."

01:51.788 --> 01:52.664
Excuse me.

01:53.039 --> 01:57.335
I was just wondering if you had any more
of those amazing cakes?

01:58.169 --> 01:59.629
I'll go and see, dear.

02:00.838 --> 02:02.006
Thanks.

02:04.175 --> 02:06.052
Why did you have to interrupt her?

02:06.761 --> 02:09.305
Because she's barking mad.

02:16.020 --> 02:19.482
- What does it say?
- "Don't let them see you're afraid."

02:19.607 --> 02:23.444
Don't let who see?

02:23.945 --> 02:26.489
You're not going already, are you, dear?

02:26.573 --> 02:29.284
You know,
I could freshen up the spare room...

02:29.367 --> 02:33.246
- and your jester could sleep in the attic.
- I'm not a jester.

02:33.329 --> 02:36.916
I'm a very important man. I've got a tower.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.668
That's nice, dear.

02:38.835 --> 02:41.087
I'm afraid we are really busy. But thank you.

02:41.212 --> 02:45.842
Here are some cakes for the road.
You never know when you might need them.

02:46.217 --> 02:50.138
And, dear, don't let them see you're afraid.

03:00.398 --> 03:02.817
Absolutely mad as pilchards.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.907
Why do you keep saying you've got a tower?

03:09.240 --> 03:10.366
Because I have.

03:12.368 --> 03:13.536
Where is it?

03:14.370 --> 03:16.581
- <i>Well...</i>
- Do you live in it?

03:18.583 --> 03:21.961
- How big is it?
- Huge, enormous.

03:22.295 --> 03:25.757
Hundreds of rooms. Stairs. Doorknobs.
A scullery.

03:26.007 --> 03:28.176
Possibly more than one scullery, actually.

03:29.010 --> 03:30.470
Right, and...

03:31.095 --> 03:33.473
I can't see it, <i>because...</i>

03:35.350 --> 03:36.809
We're not talking.

03:37.602 --> 03:38.603
What?

03:39.562 --> 03:41.105
We aren't talking.

03:42.148 --> 03:43.566
The tower and I had...

03:44.567 --> 03:47.695
a minor disagreement,
and it left without me.

03:48.446 --> 03:53.034
I said something stupid,
and it just flew off without me.

03:54.869 --> 03:57.956
Why don't you find it and say you're sorry?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.917
Valentines never apologize.

04:01.042 --> 04:03.878
Stupid building.

04:04.462 --> 04:07.257
Buildings never leave without you
where I come from.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.759
Hungry.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.388
- Is this a riddle thing?
- Hungry.

04:18.184 --> 04:19.351
Still hungry.

04:19.601 --> 04:22.563
I've got a plan. Leave this completely to me.

04:22.981 --> 04:24.065
Hello, puss.

04:24.232 --> 04:27.610
I'm out of riddles,
but how about a "knock-knock" joke?

04:27.735 --> 04:29.571
I know the best one in the world.

04:29.654 --> 04:31.573
- The best?
- Absolutely.

04:31.614 --> 04:32.740
You start.

04:32.907 --> 04:34.284
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

04:34.325 --> 04:35.743
Keep walking.

04:41.666 --> 04:43.251
Now what do we do?

04:44.210 --> 04:46.087
That was as far as my plan went.

04:49.591 --> 04:50.758
What does it say?

04:50.842 --> 04:52.594
"My pages taste excellent...

04:52.635 --> 04:55.555
"but are stickier than toffee
and very hard to chew."

04:56.723 --> 04:58.641
What an appalling book.

04:58.725 --> 05:01.936
That's the most useless thing
it's told us so far.

05:02.186 --> 05:04.480
It's not. It's a brave thing to say.

05:39.891 --> 05:42.435
This nonsense has gone on
quite long enough.

05:43.227 --> 05:45.688
She needs to grow up and come home.

05:45.855 --> 05:49.359
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go and get her!

05:59.827 --> 06:04.040
If I tell you something weird,
will you think I'm crazy?

06:04.415 --> 06:06.626
Yes. I expect so.

06:09.379 --> 06:12.799
Because when I look through windows,
not all of them...

06:13.424 --> 06:15.134
I see someone who isn't me.

06:15.260 --> 06:20.181
How odd. I do the same thing.
Me. Window. Look through it.

06:20.598 --> 06:24.060
Not me. The ones I see myself in are called...

06:24.560 --> 06:26.020
"mirrors."

06:26.271 --> 06:27.730
But she looks like me.

06:28.731 --> 06:30.566
But she isn't me.

06:31.818 --> 06:33.736
She's arguing with my dad.

06:36.739 --> 06:38.408
- "Get higher."
- What?

06:38.491 --> 06:42.704
The giant statue said, "Get higher."
Do you see anything higher than that place?

06:42.787 --> 06:43.788
Long way up.

06:46.749 --> 06:47.834
Look.

07:20.950 --> 07:22.952
There's nothing here, you know.

07:24.370 --> 07:27.123
This place is waiting to collapse
into a heap of rubble.

07:27.498 --> 07:28.625
It can't be safe.

07:28.708 --> 07:30.752
You're such a coward. It's <i>perfectly...</i>

07:37.592 --> 07:38.676
Coward?

07:38.843 --> 07:41.721
I prefer to think of myself
as prudent, cautious.

07:41.888 --> 07:45.308
And unlike some people I could name,
still up here.

07:49.562 --> 07:50.563
Hello!

07:50.688 --> 07:53.191
I'm not coming down there after you.
It's not safe.

07:53.316 --> 07:56.152
No, I'm not hurt, thanks for asking.

07:59.656 --> 08:00.865
Hello.

08:06.454 --> 08:07.455
Hi!

08:08.414 --> 08:09.832
My name's Helena.

08:13.544 --> 08:14.545
Malcolm.

08:14.712 --> 08:15.713
Bob.

08:17.924 --> 08:18.925
Bob.

08:22.095 --> 08:23.221
Bob.

08:24.889 --> 08:28.226
Hi, Bob. All the Bobs.

08:29.227 --> 08:30.186
Malcolm.

08:32.230 --> 08:33.188
Bobs.

08:34.774 --> 08:37.777
I'm looking for something. The charm.

08:39.611 --> 08:41.364
It's like a mask.

08:43.366 --> 08:45.535
Face? Yes.

08:46.494 --> 08:47.579
A face.

08:47.662 --> 08:49.831
You're having a party down there
or something?

08:49.872 --> 08:52.917
Valentine, you should come down,
I've made some friends.

08:53.001 --> 08:54.168
Nicely.

08:59.465 --> 09:00.717
Are you okay?

09:01.301 --> 09:03.845
See, look, I'm looking for a MirrorMask.

09:04.429 --> 09:05.388
Look.

09:05.972 --> 09:07.807
See, I already have the key.

09:08.933 --> 09:11.019
- Mask?
- Yes.

09:11.769 --> 09:12.729
Is it here?

09:20.612 --> 09:21.738
How regrettable.

10:17.585 --> 10:18.753
Help!

10:23.132 --> 10:26.761
I can go. I'm not supposed to be here at all.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.731
Get higher!

11:05.675 --> 11:06.968
Did you see that?

11:07.552 --> 11:10.096
I want to go over there, towards the border.

11:25.570 --> 11:28.364
Thank you, Bobs, Malcolm.

11:30.116 --> 11:31.326
Nicely.

11:35.997 --> 11:38.291
So what are we doing here?

11:38.791 --> 11:42.045
We're going to get the MirrorMask.
I know where it is.

11:42.253 --> 11:46.215
It's halfway between the night lands
and the day lands. It's on the border.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.928
I knew I could help.
I hate being so helpless.

11:50.386 --> 11:52.221
Valentine, look.

11:53.222 --> 11:56.893
We call them windows. They aren't unusual.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.321
Stop that! He's horrible.

12:09.364 --> 12:12.700
- You're horrible!
- Hey, calm down.

12:14.619 --> 12:16.037
There's nothing there.

12:41.271 --> 12:45.858
So what are we meant to be seeing?
Is this like the windows thingy again?

12:46.317 --> 12:49.279
I know it's here.
It was so obvious when I saw it.

12:49.487 --> 12:52.490
We often confuse what we wish for
with what is.

12:54.284 --> 12:56.578
These are the dreamlands on the borders.

12:57.579 --> 13:01.457
It's all wishes, hopes...

13:01.874 --> 13:03.293
and memories.

13:15.847 --> 13:17.765
It's all so familiar.

13:19.017 --> 13:20.643
I know all this.

13:24.314 --> 13:25.481
Helena?

13:29.903 --> 13:30.945
Mum?

13:36.659 --> 13:37.869
Honestly.

13:38.745 --> 13:41.289
- Mum?
- What have you lost now?

13:42.790 --> 13:46.502
I'm looking for a MirrorMask...

13:48.004 --> 13:50.673
but I don't know what it is...

13:51.674 --> 13:52.842
or how big it is...

13:53.176 --> 13:55.219
or why it's missing, or anything, really.

13:56.054 --> 13:57.805
Well, where did you last see it?

13:58.306 --> 13:59.974
I don't think I ever have.

14:00.058 --> 14:03.061
- Who had it last?
- I suppose you did.

14:04.812 --> 14:06.105
No, she did.

14:09.484 --> 14:12.153
Or maybe it was that princess
they were talking about.

14:15.198 --> 14:16.741
I don't know.

14:17.492 --> 14:19.369
I was sure it was here.

14:20.411 --> 14:22.080
You give up so easily.

14:22.163 --> 14:23.706
I'm never going to find it.

14:23.790 --> 14:27.669
Never put off till tomorrow
what you can put off until the day after.

14:31.381 --> 14:32.840
I want to come home now.

14:36.552 --> 14:38.054
I want you to be okay, Mum.

14:40.223 --> 14:43.059
- I'm scared, Mum.
- I'm scared, too, love.

14:45.019 --> 14:46.896
That's why I'm having this dream.

14:48.523 --> 14:50.733
Do you think they've started to operate yet?

14:54.487 --> 14:56.573
Maybe everybody gets dreams like this...

14:56.656 --> 14:58.700
when they start poking around in your head.

14:58.741 --> 15:01.160
It's not your dream, Mum. It's mine.

15:03.413 --> 15:06.040
That's the kind of thing
people say in dreams.

15:11.713 --> 15:12.922
Hello.

15:14.007 --> 15:15.508
Did I dream you a boyfriend?

15:16.593 --> 15:20.305
No, you did not! He's <i>not...</i> He's just <i>a...</i>

15:24.851 --> 15:26.477
I'm sorry I brought it up.

15:28.438 --> 15:31.190
Now, you're looking for something,
you know it's here...

15:31.482 --> 15:33.651
you can't find it, so look again.

15:35.445 --> 15:40.033
I'll bet it's just like your aunt Nan's teeth.
It's probably staring you right in the face.

15:42.660 --> 15:43.661
Mum.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.793
I'm sure it's here.

15:52.378 --> 15:54.213
I'm just not looking hard enough.

16:00.970 --> 16:04.849
It's not her dream. It's my dream.

16:04.974 --> 16:06.476
And if it were me...

16:07.268 --> 16:10.021
I'd put a little building
out there in the middle.

16:10.104 --> 16:11.522
A small building...

16:11.981 --> 16:14.525
but just the right size. It's obvious.

16:15.068 --> 16:17.612
And there'd be a small bridge
going across to it.

16:17.737 --> 16:21.282
Just like that one.
I don't know why I didn't see it before.

16:22.492 --> 16:26.496
You aren't my boyfriend, you know,
even if this is my mum's dream.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.927
Well, one of them must fit.

17:26.180 --> 17:27.682
My arm!

17:28.975 --> 17:32.854
- You're hurt. Stay here. Don't move.
- What about you?

17:33.062 --> 17:34.188
I'm a panther.

17:34.814 --> 17:37.483
I shall slip unnoticed
through the darkness...

17:37.734 --> 17:40.320
like a dark, unnoticeable, slippy thing.

17:40.945 --> 17:42.113
Valentine.

17:42.697 --> 17:45.241
I know we haven't always got on, but...

17:46.993 --> 17:51.623
I'm really grateful for all your help. I
couldn't have done any of this without you.

17:51.915 --> 17:53.166
I do my best.

17:55.293 --> 17:56.794
Come back soon.

18:52.475 --> 18:53.518
Dad?

19:00.108 --> 19:03.278
Dad. That's not me.

19:03.861 --> 19:06.698
Dad. I'm here. Dad!

19:17.625 --> 19:19.002
Help!

19:19.043 --> 19:20.587
Help me!

19:28.553 --> 19:31.014
I don't know what time you call this.

19:31.681 --> 19:33.474
I've been worried sick about you.

19:36.311 --> 19:38.521
I just want to hear a little...

19:38.771 --> 19:41.065
"Sorry for putting you to all this trouble."

19:41.691 --> 19:43.943
Would it be too much to ask for an apology?

19:44.027 --> 19:45.111
Me?

19:45.194 --> 19:47.572
You're the one causing all the damage.

19:50.074 --> 19:52.410
Don't be ridiculous.

19:54.454 --> 19:57.582
- Who do you think is destroying this world?
- You are.

19:57.749 --> 19:59.459
I've seen the black shadows.

19:59.626 --> 20:01.753
What would any worried mother do?

20:02.670 --> 20:05.048
I was just trying to bring us back together.

20:05.131 --> 20:07.550
That's why you put up
the "wanted" posters?

20:08.051 --> 20:10.762
People do it for lost pets...

20:11.971 --> 20:15.975
and a daughter
is a lot more important than a pet.

20:16.059 --> 20:17.852
I'm not your daughter.

20:24.734 --> 20:25.860
You'll do.

20:26.694 --> 20:29.530
We can fix your hair.

20:29.572 --> 20:33.284
Those clothes will have to go.

20:33.409 --> 20:35.453
I'll get the servants to burn them.

20:35.536 --> 20:39.415
I don't know what you're trying to pull,
but there are people who know where I am.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.961
- Valentine will rescue me.
- Valentine.

20:43.753 --> 20:45.588
I'd nearly forgotten about him.

20:53.263 --> 20:54.597
Valentine?

20:56.975 --> 21:00.019
Well, we were already here,
and she'd put up the posters.

21:00.144 --> 21:02.730
Reward paid. Nothing personal.

21:03.564 --> 21:05.108
It's just supply and demand.

21:05.233 --> 21:06.859
You pathetic creep.

21:07.193 --> 21:11.072
Rocks and logs can bite like dogs,
but words will never hurt me.

21:11.114 --> 21:14.284
You useless cake-hogging coward!

21:14.367 --> 21:15.785
I did not hog that cake!

21:15.868 --> 21:19.122
I'm sorry, Mr. Valentine...

21:19.831 --> 21:21.916
but I shall have to hurry you along.

21:22.458 --> 21:24.794
I need to spend some serious...

21:25.128 --> 21:28.256
"quality" time with my little girl.

21:28.339 --> 21:29.799
Right.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.343
Thank you for popping by.

21:32.468 --> 21:37.098
I believe somebody said something
about jewels.

21:37.682 --> 21:40.643
- As many as I can carry?
- If you must.

21:58.578 --> 22:02.624
Right, so, no hard feelings then, yeah?

22:02.749 --> 22:04.125
Just go.

22:04.167 --> 22:08.421
I'm on my way out. Off to get <i>the...</i>
Nothing more to say.

22:08.504 --> 22:11.174
- Throw him out.
- Yeah, right.

22:13.343 --> 22:17.555
The princess will be going to her chambers.

22:21.351 --> 22:22.727
Please. Just let me go.

22:22.810 --> 22:25.438
Darling. You know what you need?

22:25.855 --> 22:27.815
I need to find the charm.

22:27.857 --> 22:30.151
I need to wake the White Queen. I need...

22:30.193 --> 22:32.195
You need a pretty frock.

22:33.029 --> 22:35.031
- And a happy smile.
- A smile?

22:35.740 --> 22:39.577
With a smile on your face,
everything will seem brighter, because...

22:40.578 --> 22:43.414
from now on we <i>are...</i>

22:44.582 --> 22:45.792
What?

22:45.875 --> 22:47.752
- I don't know.
- Tell her!

22:47.877 --> 22:50.880
Not at home to Mr. Grumpy, Your Majesty.

22:51.339 --> 22:52.507
Exactly.

27:59.439 --> 28:02.191
Presenting the MirrorMask.

28:18.166 --> 28:19.667
<i>"Dearest Mama...</i>

28:20.293 --> 28:23.546
<i>"as by now you may have realized,</i>
<i>I have found the MirrorMask.</i>

28:24.005 --> 28:26.883
<i>"I will use it to go away.</i>
<i>There are other places.</i>

28:27.175 --> 28:29.636
<i>"I'll find one with another girl in it like me.</i>

28:30.470 --> 28:32.513
<i>"A life I can take."</i>

28:32.597 --> 28:33.973
Stupid.

28:35.892 --> 28:37.268
<i>"Of course...</i>

28:37.727 --> 28:40.855
<i>"if I use the MirrorMask,</i>
<i>it may upset things a bit.</i>

28:42.815 --> 28:46.611
<i>"But you can't run away from home</i>
<i>without destroying somebody's world."</i>

28:51.741 --> 28:53.576
Have some more ice cream, Princess.

28:54.410 --> 28:57.580
No, thank you, dearest Mama.
I believe I have had sufficient.

28:58.414 --> 29:00.959
Well, your manners are much improved,
anyway.

29:11.678 --> 29:13.930
- What's that?
- I have no idea.

29:23.314 --> 29:24.315
Go on.

29:25.275 --> 29:26.651
Be my eyes.

29:28.319 --> 29:31.990
- Find out what's happening.
- You know what's happening.

29:32.740 --> 29:35.451
She's going to destroy everything,
your real daughter.

29:36.119 --> 29:39.414
When she left, she threw this whole world
out of balance, and now...

29:39.622 --> 29:40.957
it's falling apart.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.959
You will not talk to me like that!

29:48.131 --> 29:50.258
Dear Mama, sorry, Mama.

29:52.552 --> 29:54.971
Can I have some more ice cream now,
please?

30:14.198 --> 30:18.453
I suppose that "oops" and "I promise
not to do it again" isn't actually going to...

30:18.953 --> 30:20.204
cut the mustard.

30:20.830 --> 30:23.625
Helena, if I was to <i>say...</i>

30:34.010 --> 30:36.137
If I was to say something apologetic...

30:37.055 --> 30:40.850
it would reflect my feelings
in this matter accurately.

30:41.851 --> 30:44.062
And you were right, you know...

30:44.729 --> 30:46.773
and I was not as right as you were.

30:47.190 --> 30:48.316
About everything.

30:49.067 --> 30:50.360
The windows.

30:50.401 --> 30:52.362
The world ending.

30:52.904 --> 30:56.532
And you probably hate me.
I mean, I'd hate me, too.

31:04.457 --> 31:05.500
Look...

31:07.543 --> 31:09.295
whatever she's done to you...

31:10.838 --> 31:13.007
I know you're still in there.

31:26.771 --> 31:29.941
Oh, well! Onwards and upwards.

31:52.297 --> 31:53.381
Butterfingers.

31:54.090 --> 31:55.592
Well, if I was that princess
and I wanted to hide something...

31:58.928 --> 32:01.222
I'd hide it in my bedroom.

32:01.306 --> 32:03.391
We've looked all over. It's not here.

32:04.309 --> 32:06.519
Well, that's what I'd do.

32:08.313 --> 32:09.564
What are you saying?

32:09.856 --> 32:11.899
Something destroyed the Pit of Despair.

32:11.983 --> 32:14.444
The Swamp of Doom simply isn't there
anymore.

32:14.527 --> 32:17.739
It was a lovely swamp.
You can't get them like that these days.

32:17.780 --> 32:20.658
I'm afraid somebody is actually doing this.

32:20.909 --> 32:21.910
Who?

32:21.951 --> 32:24.746
Somebody who hates me.

32:24.787 --> 32:28.583
Nobody hates you, Majesty. We love you.

32:31.127 --> 32:32.253
Crawler.

32:33.212 --> 32:34.923
But he has a point.

32:35.632 --> 32:37.300
I must call a council.

32:40.970 --> 32:42.764
It's all falling apart.

32:44.140 --> 32:46.100
It's all her fault, that girl.

32:46.809 --> 32:48.394
Let me see her note again.

32:58.821 --> 33:00.823
She says she found the MirrorMask.

33:01.115 --> 33:04.577
- That's probably how she got out of here.
- We looked everywhere.

33:05.245 --> 33:06.829
We looked all over the place.

33:07.038 --> 33:09.499
We could keep looking
until the end of the world.

33:11.542 --> 33:13.419
Message from Her Majesty.

33:13.503 --> 33:15.964
Affairs of state, means she's very busy...

33:16.089 --> 33:18.633
and you'll be eating in your room tonight.

33:18.758 --> 33:20.009
Mama is too kind.

33:25.848 --> 33:27.058
Right.

33:28.059 --> 33:30.436
Well, bon appétit.

33:30.770 --> 33:32.522
Please thank Her Majesty for me.

33:40.196 --> 33:41.364
Food!

33:47.537 --> 33:49.497
We've missed so many opportunities.

33:50.373 --> 33:52.500
We don't even have the <i>Really useful book.</i>

33:59.591 --> 34:01.217
There's just one page left.

34:04.053 --> 34:05.555
What if it's the wrong page?

34:11.643 --> 34:13.688
"Remember what your mother told you."

34:13.771 --> 34:14.897
Mine always said...

34:15.481 --> 34:17.734
"It's a dog-eat-dog world, Son...

34:17.817 --> 34:19.610
"you get them before they get you.

34:19.902 --> 34:21.029
"Eat your greens.

34:21.404 --> 34:24.866
"Please don't do that. Don't embarrass me
in front of the neighbors.

34:24.991 --> 34:28.494
"It will be best for everyone if you
leave home and don't ever come back."

34:30.038 --> 34:31.873
She wasn't actually my mum, either.

34:33.458 --> 34:34.958
She bought me from a man.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.922
I miss my mum.

34:39.672 --> 34:41.716
She'd always have good advice.

34:43.176 --> 34:46.387
Like, when you lose something, she'd say,
"Don't you give up.

34:47.889 --> 34:51.935
"Most of the time,
it's just staring you right in the face."

34:59.776 --> 35:01.736
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

35:01.819 --> 35:04.280
Absolutely! If we just put little wheels...

35:04.322 --> 35:06.783
on the bottoms of our shoes,
we could just roll around.

35:06.824 --> 35:09.285
No, silly.
Where's the best place to hide a mirror?

35:30.390 --> 35:32.058
We need to find a window.

35:32.892 --> 35:34.811
Before or after dinner?

35:35.228 --> 35:36.396
Oh, Valentine!

35:40.066 --> 35:41.276
Faster.

35:41.484 --> 35:44.028
- Keep on, hurry.
- Princess!

35:45.071 --> 35:46.739
Not again.

35:48.825 --> 35:52.870
Keep going. Faster. Keep going. Yes. Faster!

35:53.162 --> 35:57.625
Run. Keep going. Faster.
Don't let anything distract you.

35:58.126 --> 35:59.460
Food!

36:00.044 --> 36:03.506
But we have to keep going.
There isn't enough time!

36:03.590 --> 36:05.133
You're absolutely right.

36:05.633 --> 36:06.843
All right.

36:11.681 --> 36:13.641
Is he very holy, my love?

36:14.559 --> 36:16.769
Holy? No.

36:17.061 --> 36:18.855
I don't think so.

36:19.606 --> 36:22.901
The holy people. They eat the future fruit...

36:22.984 --> 36:26.446
and then they bring back words of wisdom.

36:26.654 --> 36:30.950
Sometimes they write whole books.
It's wonderful.

36:31.784 --> 36:33.578
Takes one fruit...

36:34.203 --> 36:36.831
300 years to grow, my petal.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.542
Not bad. Rather yummy, actually.

36:39.709 --> 36:41.336
Why do they call it a future fruit?

36:41.377 --> 36:45.673
Because that's where you go
when you eat it, my love.

36:53.723 --> 36:55.600
Valentine, give me the MirrorMask.

36:55.850 --> 36:57.060
For heaven's sake.

36:57.143 --> 36:59.854
There's only one way out, and I'm taking it.
Goodbye.

37:09.697 --> 37:10.698
Bring beer.

37:20.541 --> 37:23.544
That's not my future.

37:25.004 --> 37:27.006
No! I don't want to be a waiter!

37:30.093 --> 37:33.930
I think a retaliatory strike
against the White City...

37:34.055 --> 37:36.557
is really the only way to go on this.

37:36.683 --> 37:38.643
You are talking through your hat!

37:38.768 --> 37:40.311
With respect, Majesty...

37:40.436 --> 37:42.814
I think this entire
end-of-the-world scenario...

37:42.897 --> 37:44.857
is grossly over-exaggerated.

37:44.941 --> 37:48.278
- We are wildly overreacting to a minor...
- Minor?

37:48.361 --> 37:51.155
You try living in a swamp
that isn't there anymore, mate.

37:51.239 --> 37:53.533
You come and tell me that that's minor.

37:53.616 --> 37:57.829
Look. All I'm saying is,
is there a place for total world destruction...

37:57.954 --> 38:00.290
vis-a-vis a scenario, which is simply not...

38:05.378 --> 38:06.421
What?

38:07.839 --> 38:09.132
It's the Princess.

38:10.300 --> 38:13.303
What about the Princess?

38:13.636 --> 38:17.307
You remember what you said the first time
that she ran away?

38:18.975 --> 38:21.060
The first time?

38:26.482 --> 38:29.819
This MirrorMask, there must be a way
to use it to get us out of here.

38:29.861 --> 38:32.947
I need to find a window. If I can see her,
I bet I can get to her.

38:32.989 --> 38:34.741
There won't be any windows in the forest.

38:34.824 --> 38:36.868
- I have to see what she's doing.
- We know that.

38:36.951 --> 38:39.412
Whether she means to or not,
she's destroying the world.

38:39.495 --> 38:42.498
Yeah, and eating chips, snogging boys,
smoking and everything!

38:51.841 --> 38:55.470
Why do people wear these stupid dresses?

39:01.726 --> 39:05.271
I should have known you'd have something
to do with this, Valentine.

39:05.355 --> 39:06.314
<i>Well...</i>

39:06.814 --> 39:10.109
You listen to me. Your daughter
is going to destroy everything.

39:10.610 --> 39:13.029
I need to find a window and get back there.

39:13.196 --> 39:15.698
Please, let us go.

39:16.241 --> 39:19.202
- You are my daughter.
- But you know that's not true.

39:19.327 --> 39:20.828
I am a reasonable woman.

39:22.038 --> 39:23.498
You come back with me.

39:23.998 --> 39:27.669
I'll execute Valentine humanely.

39:28.253 --> 39:31.381
- And we'll say no more about it.
- She's not a pet.

39:31.464 --> 39:35.635
She's not even a child anymore.
You have to let her grow up.

39:35.718 --> 39:39.222
You mean, let her choose her own food...

39:39.472 --> 39:42.225
her own clothes, make her own decisions.

39:43.393 --> 39:46.854
- Love her, don't try to possess her.
- Yes.

39:47.188 --> 39:49.023
That's exactly what I mean.

39:50.066 --> 39:52.068
Absolutely out of the question.

39:54.779 --> 39:57.365
I don't need this, you know.
I'm a very important man.

39:57.407 --> 39:59.909
If we can't get away from her,
you're a very dead man.

39:59.951 --> 40:02.787
That thing that you have that makes light.
Where is it?

40:03.454 --> 40:05.498
And the mask. Give me the MirrorMask.

40:06.332 --> 40:08.543
For God's sake. I know what I'm doing!

40:12.755 --> 40:15.550
It should have been here by now.
That was always our signal.

40:15.592 --> 40:17.343
I thought you said you had an argument.

40:17.427 --> 40:20.471
More of a difference of opinion.
I was completely in the right.

40:21.139 --> 40:23.099
Sometimes you just have to say sorry.

40:23.182 --> 40:25.560
No. I'll never say that.

40:33.151 --> 40:35.069
All right. I'll say it!

40:36.446 --> 40:38.698
I'm sorry!

40:45.622 --> 40:47.916
You have a real tower.

40:47.957 --> 40:50.668
Well, you know, I am a very important man.

41:22.867 --> 41:24.118
Look.

41:24.619 --> 41:26.788
There's only one way out. The windows.

41:26.913 --> 41:29.916
The ones I drew. They're doors between
our world and her world...

41:29.999 --> 41:31.376
and she's destroying them.

41:31.459 --> 41:35.338
Valentine! Give me the MirrorMask.
For heaven's sake!

41:39.467 --> 41:40.843
What's happening?

41:42.720 --> 41:45.556
<i>There's no more windows left. It's over.</i>

41:46.808 --> 41:47.976
<i>She won.</i>

41:52.355 --> 41:53.856
I'm not going back.

42:56.711 --> 42:58.838
No. I'm not going back!

42:58.922 --> 43:01.674
- This is my world.
- No! I like it here.

43:01.758 --> 43:03.134
I just want a real life.

43:03.217 --> 43:06.387
Real life? You couldn't handle real life.

43:53.559 --> 43:54.727
Helena.

43:59.315 --> 44:00.858
- Dad?
- Hello.

44:02.527 --> 44:03.861
It's gone.

44:06.072 --> 44:08.116
It's a funny place to go to sleep, love.

44:08.825 --> 44:10.159
I wasn't asleep.

44:10.493 --> 44:11.911
Mum! Is <i>she...</i>

44:12.453 --> 44:15.790
There's no news yet.
We've got to keep our fingers crossed.

44:16.624 --> 44:18.668
Look at you. In your pj's.

44:19.377 --> 44:22.171
Come on, you're going to be freezing.
Come on, here.

44:22.672 --> 44:24.007
Put this on.

44:26.301 --> 44:28.386
There we go. Okay?

44:30.013 --> 44:31.639
It's in my pocket.

44:34.851 --> 44:36.019
Hello.

44:37.020 --> 44:38.104
Yeah.

44:38.438 --> 44:39.981
He's here. I'll put him on.

44:40.690 --> 44:43.026
- It's for you. It's the hospital.
- Hello.

44:44.569 --> 44:45.653
Yes.

44:51.075 --> 44:52.410
Thank you...

44:53.328 --> 44:54.704
for telling me.

44:56.247 --> 44:57.457
Yeah.

44:58.750 --> 45:00.835
I'll make the arrangements.

45:00.919 --> 45:02.712
Please.

45:04.297 --> 45:07.050
What did they say? Dad?

45:08.718 --> 45:11.804
She's fine, she's going to be fine.

45:13.181 --> 45:14.557
They got it all.

45:27.695 --> 45:29.489
Let's go in and get ready.

45:31.282 --> 45:32.742
We are going to be fine.

46:05.233 --> 46:07.777
Actually, I've always fancied
joining a circus.

46:07.902 --> 46:12.115
All right. You need to be over 18,
pass the audition, and mad.

46:12.407 --> 46:13.408
Thanks.

46:32.176 --> 46:33.469
I'm sorry.

46:35.305 --> 46:36.764
That's okay.

46:36.806 --> 46:39.309
- I was talking to the woman in the window.
- My mother.

46:39.392 --> 46:42.312
I was talking to the lovely lady
in the window.

46:42.604 --> 46:45.648
You know, I always wanted to work
in the circus.

46:47.275 --> 46:50.361
Good. You'd have made a lousy waiter.

46:55.825 --> 46:56.951
Yeah.

46:59.037 --> 47:00.079
What?

47:01.305 --> 47:07.366
