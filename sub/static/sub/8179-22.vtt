READ THE PAPER,

00:29.161 --> 00:31.579
OR ARE YOU GONNA
STRANGLE SOMEONE?

00:31.731 --> 00:35.233
THE CHEAP INK THEY USE
MAKES MY FINGERS BLACK.

00:46.545 --> 00:49.364
OK. THANKS FOR
WETTIN' DOWN PAGE 1.

00:49.431 --> 00:51.366
BY THE WAY, YOU GOT
A PHONE CALL BEFORE.

00:51.433 --> 00:53.401
SOME GUY IRV
FROM THE SENIOR CENTER.

00:53.469 --> 00:55.403
HE WANTED TO KNOW
IF YOU COULD, UH,

00:55.471 --> 00:57.539
FILL IN FOR HIM AT THE
FRONT DESK NEXT WEEK.

00:57.607 --> 01:01.242

OF AUTHORITY IN YEARS.

01:01.310 --> 01:03.595
NO, I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T DO IT.

01:05.164 --> 01:07.332
OR COULD I?

01:08.834 --> 01:12.036
THE WILL IS THERE, BUT
DO I HAVE THE STAMINA?

01:12.104 --> 01:15.039
DAMN IT, IF IRV NEEDS
ME, I CAN'T LET HIM DOWN!

01:15.107 --> 01:16.958
I'LL DO IT.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.327

01:47.023 --> 01:49.824
LET'S LIGHT THIS CANDLE.

01:52.812 --> 01:56.114
JOSEPHINE, CAN I SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

01:58.417 --> 01:59.584
HAVE A SEAT.

02:02.588 --> 02:06.123
AS YOU KNOW, I'M TAKING OVER
THE REINS FROM IRV.

02:06.192 --> 02:09.460
I THINK WE SHOULD DISCUSS
WHAT I EXPECT FROM YOU.

02:11.029 --> 02:13.281
WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?

02:14.750 --> 02:17.101
I'M THE GUY
WHO'S GONNA MAKE THIS

02:17.169 --> 02:20.538
THE BEST-RUN SENIOR CENTER
IN THE CITY.

02:20.606 --> 02:21.889
THAT'S WHO.

02:23.525 --> 02:27.445
NOW, WHAT'S ON
MY CALENDAR?

02:33.085 --> 02:36.721

03:04.283 --> 03:06.684

JUST OUT OF THE BLUE.

03:06.752 --> 03:08.920
WIFE'S CLEARLY

AHEM.

STRIP CLUB?

04:16.305 --> 04:19.156
JUST TAKE ME HOME.

04:19.224 --> 04:20.125
FINE.

04:20.274 --> 04:21.575
LOOK, SPENCE...

04:21.642 --> 04:25.213
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA FIND
SOMEBODY JUST AS GOOD AS DENISE,

04:25.280 --> 04:26.214
IF NOT BETTER.

04:26.281 --> 04:28.165
OH, YEAH? RIGHT.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.734
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M GONNA FIND A WOMAN

04:29.802 --> 04:33.554
WHO'S AS INTO AVANT-GARDE FILM
AS I AM OR FOLK DANCING

04:33.622 --> 04:37.258
OR IS A NINTH-LEVEL PLAYER
THE GATHERING?

04:39.594 --> 04:41.428
ABSOLUTELY.

04:41.496 --> 04:43.297
NO, I BLEW IT.

04:43.365 --> 04:46.433
I- I SHOULD HAVE
FOUGHT FOR HER.

04:46.501 --> 04:49.237
I SHOULD HAVE GRABBED HER
BY THOSE INCREDIBLE SHOULDERS

04:49.271 --> 04:53.540
AND SAID, "I LOVE YOU,
AND I KNOW YOU LOVE ME."

04:53.608 --> 04:55.476
BUT DID I DO THAT? NO.

04:55.543 --> 04:58.579
YOU KNOW WHY? SAME REASON
I'M SELLING TOKENS ON THE SUBWAY

04:58.647 --> 05:00.381
INSTEAD OF DRIVING THE TRAIN.

05:00.448 --> 05:02.467
I THOUGHT YOU FAILED
THE PSYCH TEST.

05:02.534 --> 05:04.469
YOU DIDN'T SEE
THAT INKBLOT!

05:04.536 --> 05:07.305
THE BOTTOM LINE IS
EVERYTHING WOULD BE DIFFERENT

05:07.373 --> 05:09.340
IF I'D JUST
TAKEN A STAND!

05:09.408 --> 05:11.976
WELL, MAYBE IT'S
NOT TOO LATE.

05:12.044 --> 05:13.311
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:13.378 --> 05:15.313
TO TELL DENISE WHAT YOU JUST TOLD US.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.815
BUT SHE'S GETTING MARRIED
IN MEMPHIS TOMORROW.

05:17.883 --> 05:22.654
I MEAN, EVEN IF I WANTED TO, I
COULDN'T MAKE IT THERE IN TIME.

05:22.721 --> 05:25.723
YOU COULD IF WE
START DRIVING RIGHT NOW.

05:25.791 --> 05:27.458
REALLY?

05:27.526 --> 05:29.561
KELLY AND THE KIDS
ARE AT HER MOM'S.

05:29.628 --> 05:31.663
I GOT NOPLACE ELSE
TO BE. I'M IN.

05:31.730 --> 05:33.481
YOU REALLY THINK
WE CAN DO THIS?

05:33.549 --> 05:35.483
IF WE'RE GONNA GO
ON AN EXTENDED TRIP,

05:35.551 --> 05:37.985
I'M GONNA HAVE TO STOP
AND GET MY BITE PLATE.

05:38.053 --> 05:39.654
BUT WHAT-WHAT IF
I'M WRONG, THOUGH?

05:39.721 --> 05:41.989
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T
LOVE ME BACK?

05:42.057 --> 05:43.658
WELL, MAYBE SHE DOES,
AND MAYBE SHE DOESN'T.

05:43.725 --> 05:45.193
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.927
BECAUSE IF I SLEEP
WITHOUT THAT THING,

05:46.995 --> 05:48.763
MY JAW SNAPS SHUT
LIKE A BEAR TRAP.

05:48.830 --> 05:50.198
I DON'T KNOW.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.499
SPENCE, LOOK, YOU
GOT A CHANCE HERE,

05:51.567 --> 05:52.834
AND YOU
GOTTA GO FOR IT.

05:52.901 --> 05:54.085
IF YOU DON'T
GO FOR IT,

05:54.152 --> 05:55.687
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

05:55.754 --> 05:58.156
SO WHERE AM I
STEERING THIS CAR?

06:00.659 --> 06:02.026
MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE.

06:02.094 --> 06:03.294
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! YEAH!

06:03.361 --> 06:04.762
YEAH!

06:31.023 --> 06:32.590
W- WHY CAN'T I?

06:32.658 --> 06:35.326

06:35.393 --> 06:36.928
LOOK, ALL I WANT
IS POP-TARTS.

06:38.430 --> 06:39.447
PLEASE, OK?

06:39.515 --> 06:41.165

WOULD DO THIS THING, OK?

06:41.233 --> 06:43.001
I'M-YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:43.068 --> 06:45.169
I'M DOING IT.

06:45.237 --> 06:46.521
SHE'S COOL.
SHE'S VERY COOL.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.410
OK, SHE CHECKED IN
LAST NIGHT?

06:52.477 --> 06:53.845
OK, GREAT, THANKS.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.115
I GOT IT. DENISE IS STAYING AT
THE WEST MEMPHIS ECONO-LODGE.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.150
FANCY.

06:59.218 --> 07:00.968
WELL...

07:01.036 --> 07:03.354
IN ABOUT 10 HOURS,
SHE'S GONNA OPEN HER DOOR

07:03.421 --> 07:06.824
TO FIND ME STANDING THERE
HOLDING A SINGLE RED ROSE

07:06.892 --> 07:08.559
AND SAYING,
"EXCUSE ME, MISS,

07:08.627 --> 07:12.463
I THINK I LEFT
MY LOVE IN HERE."

07:12.531 --> 07:14.398
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
THERE YOU GO.

07:14.466 --> 07:17.201
IN CASE I DIDN'T SAY IT,
THANKS FOR THIS.

07:17.269 --> 07:18.769
THAT'S WHAT
FRIENDS DO.

07:18.837 --> 07:20.170
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.

07:20.238 --> 07:21.338
RIGHT BACK AT YA.

07:21.406 --> 07:24.108
I'M GLAD YOU'RE

07:26.645 --> 07:29.246
OK, LOVE SCENE OVER.

07:29.314 --> 07:30.965
WE'RE COMING UP

GREAT!

07:32.534 --> 07:35.920

07:38.524 --> 07:39.757
AND THEN STRAIGHT
THROUGH BARTLETT

07:39.825 --> 07:41.025
AND ON INTO MEMPHIS.

07:41.092 --> 07:43.193
HEH HEH.

07:43.261 --> 07:45.580
OH, DEAC, DOESN'T
YOUR DAD LIVE IN BARTLETT?

07:45.647 --> 07:46.948
UH-HUH.

07:47.015 --> 07:49.917
NO REASON WE CAN'T STOP IN
ON THE WAY BACK.

07:49.985 --> 07:50.985
THAT'S OK.

07:51.053 --> 07:51.885
NNNNNN!

07:52.037 --> 07:54.005
NO, I MEAN, IT'S SILLY.
IT'S ON THE WAY.

07:54.073 --> 07:55.573
I SAID NO.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.926
WHAT PART OF NNNN-NN
DIDN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:58.994 --> 08:01.546
SORRY.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.597
HEY, IS IT ME OR...

08:03.665 --> 08:06.067
THOSE COWS GETTING
ANYBODY ELSE HUNGRY?

08:06.135 --> 08:08.335
I COULD EAT.

08:08.403 --> 08:10.138
WHY DON'T YOU
WAKE DANNY UP?

08:10.205 --> 08:12.173
OH, HE'S ASLEEP?

08:12.241 --> 08:14.675
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO SLEEP
WITHOUT HIS BITE PLATE.

08:14.743 --> 08:16.277
HEY, DANNY, WE'RE GONNA
GET SOME FOOD.

08:16.344 --> 08:17.461
DANNY!

08:17.529 --> 08:19.313
OH.

08:29.657 --> 08:31.208
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:31.276 --> 08:32.208
I NEED $600.

08:32.277 --> 08:34.061
WHAT?

08:34.129 --> 08:36.046
I NEED $600.

08:36.114 --> 08:37.881
OW!

08:37.948 --> 08:39.183
CAN YOU GIVE THE GUY
A CREDIT CARD?

08:39.251 --> 08:41.969
HE WON'T TAKE ONE.
HE WANTS CASH.

08:42.037 --> 08:43.104
WHAT?

08:43.172 --> 08:44.270
HE WANTS CASH!

08:44.339 --> 08:45.272
OW!

08:45.340 --> 08:47.141
IT HURTS TO TALK.

08:47.209 --> 08:47.975
WHAT?

08:48.043 --> 08:50.344
IT HURTS WHEN I TALK!

08:50.411 --> 08:52.697
CAN WE JUST PAY THE GUY
AND GET OUT OF HERE?

08:52.765 --> 08:55.132
LOOK, I'VE GOT $100.

08:57.068 --> 08:58.152
I GOT, LIKE, 80.

08:58.219 --> 08:59.754
I GOT, LIKE, 50.

08:59.821 --> 09:00.955
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

09:01.023 --> 09:03.808
WELL, MY WALLET'S AT HOME
ON MY DRESSER

09:03.875 --> 09:06.144
NEXT TO MY BITE PLATE.

09:06.211 --> 09:09.464
WE'RE STILL WAY SHORT.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

09:24.746 --> 09:27.982
I DON'T THINK THIS THING
FITS RIGHT.

09:28.050 --> 09:30.234
YEAH, WELL, IT COST ME
A LEATHER JACKET,

09:30.301 --> 09:32.803
SO I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO MAKE IT FIT.

09:32.871 --> 09:35.105
LOOK AT THAT,
CACHINGO INDIAN CASINO.

09:35.173 --> 09:36.741
OH, YEAH?

09:36.809 --> 09:38.409
WE NEED CASH, AND YOU CAN
GET A CRAPLOAD OF MONEY

09:38.476 --> 09:40.377
WITH JUST YOUR CREDIT
CARD AT THOSE PLACES.

09:40.445 --> 09:42.330
GUYS, IT'S 22 MILES
OUT OF THE WAY.

09:42.397 --> 09:43.430
WE'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE IT TO THE HOTEL

09:43.498 --> 09:45.566
BEFORE DENISE LEAVES
FOR THE WEDDING.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.318
YOU WANT TO STOP A WEDDING,
YOU DO IT AT THE CHURCH.

09:47.386 --> 09:48.319
EVERYBODY
KNOWS THAT.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.021
I STILL SAY WE KEEP GOING.

09:51.089 --> 09:53.758
WHOA, SHE'S TURNING.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

09:53.825 --> 09:55.259
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:55.327 --> 09:56.294
IT'S NOT ME.
IT'S THE CAR.

09:56.361 --> 09:57.328
SHE'S TAKING US THERE.

09:57.396 --> 09:59.530
SHE DOES THIS
WITH KRISPY KREME, TOO.

09:59.598 --> 10:02.833
JUST GO IN AND GET
MONEY. NO GAMBLING, OK?

10:02.901 --> 10:04.168
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

10:11.009 --> 10:12.426
SHUTTY.

10:17.248 --> 10:18.850
STILL DECLINED, MA'AM.

10:18.917 --> 10:19.634
WHAT?

10:24.122 --> 10:25.356
SORRY.

10:25.423 --> 10:28.125
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

10:29.995 --> 10:32.629
DO I HAVE TO PUT
THIS STUFF BACK OR...

10:32.697 --> 10:36.601
YEAH. EXCUSE ME. THANK YOU.

10:36.668 --> 10:38.569
I'M SORRY. SORRY.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.805
THANKS.

10:49.647 --> 10:51.415
HI, IRV.

10:51.483 --> 10:54.251
IRV'S NOT HERE. THE
NAME'S ARTHUR SPOONER.

10:54.319 --> 10:55.820
AND YOU ARE?

10:55.921 --> 10:58.522
STEVE GITT.
I'M WITH ROYALE PUDDING.

10:58.590 --> 11:00.575
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU,
MR. GITT.

11:00.642 --> 11:02.677
HOW YOU LIKE TO PREY
ON THE ELDERLY

11:02.744 --> 11:05.713
AND THEIR WEAKNESS
FOR CREAMY DESSERTS.

11:07.532 --> 11:08.883
WELL, NEWS FLASH, MISTER.

11:08.951 --> 11:12.753
YOUR DAYS OF PRICE GOUGING
ARE ABOUT TO END.

11:12.821 --> 11:16.974
UM, WHAT WE CHARGE IS RIGHT IN
LINE WITH THE OTHER COMPANIES.

11:17.042 --> 11:18.826
I DON'T WANT SOME PRICE
COOKED UP

11:18.894 --> 11:21.896
IN THE SMOKE-FILLED ROOMS
OF YOUR PUDDING CARTEL.

11:23.031 --> 11:24.565
I WANT REAL VALUE.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.734
NOW, I'M GOING TO
WRITE DOWN A NUMBER,

11:26.802 --> 11:30.638
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO PAY FROM NOW ON.

11:33.892 --> 11:36.059
WHERE'S A PEN?

11:36.127 --> 11:37.061
YOU CAN USE MINE.

11:37.129 --> 11:37.828
THANK YOU.

11:40.448 --> 11:42.717
WHAT'S THIS,
YOUR COMPANY LOGO?

11:42.784 --> 11:43.917
MM-HMM.

11:43.985 --> 11:46.920
MMM, IT'S QUITE
A HANDSOME PEN.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.207
YOU CAN KEEP IT
IF YOU WANT.

11:50.275 --> 11:53.043
YOU MEAN THAT?

11:53.111 --> 11:54.128
SURE.

11:56.815 --> 11:59.683
NICELY PLAYED, MR. GITT.

12:02.921 --> 12:04.087
HOW ARE WE DOING
ON TIME?

12:04.155 --> 12:05.456
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY, SPENCE.

12:05.524 --> 12:06.590
WE'LL GET YOU TO YOUR PRECIOUS WEDDING.

12:06.658 --> 12:08.025
TAKE IT EASY ON HIM.

12:08.092 --> 12:10.327
THANKS, BUT I THINK I
HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR ADVICE

12:10.395 --> 12:12.029
BACK AT THAT
BLACKJACK TABLE.

12:12.096 --> 12:13.314
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

12:13.382 --> 12:14.698
"OH, YOU GOTTA
SPLIT THOSE 8s. "

12:14.766 --> 12:17.367
YOU ALWAYS SPLIT 8s.
THAT'S WHAT THE BOOK SAYS.

12:17.435 --> 12:19.703
<i>WHAT BOOK IS THAT, THE SECRETS
OF LOSING, BY I.B. STUPID?</i>

12:19.771 --> 12:20.721
HE'S RIGHT. YOU
ALWAYS SPLIT 8s.

12:20.788 --> 12:22.139
YOU DIDN'T HELP
MATTERS EITHER,

12:22.206 --> 12:23.774
SMILING AT ME
LIKE THAT... JINXY.

12:23.842 --> 12:26.009
DON'T CALL ME JINXY.

12:26.077 --> 12:27.094
YOU OWE ME $200.

12:27.162 --> 12:28.378
YOU OWE ME A NEW
LEATHER JACKET.

12:28.446 --> 12:29.246
GUYS...

12:29.314 --> 12:30.664
THAT'S JINXY'S FAULT!

12:30.732 --> 12:32.166
DON'T SAY THAT!

12:32.234 --> 12:33.351
JUST SHUT UP.

12:33.418 --> 12:34.885
I GOT A SLIGHTLY
BETTER IDEA.

12:34.953 --> 12:36.653
<i>WHY DON'T YOU
SHUT UP?</i>

12:36.721 --> 12:38.606
YOU'RE BUYING ME
A JACKET.

12:38.673 --> 12:42.376
OK, DON'T BE
TOUCHING ME.

12:42.444 --> 12:44.278
I'LL TOUCH YOU
ALL I WANT.

12:44.346 --> 12:47.314
DON'T DO THAT, MAN!

12:47.382 --> 12:51.785
OH! OH, MY GOD.
THE ANNOUNCEMENT FLEW OUT!

12:51.853 --> 12:52.903
SO?

12:53.055 --> 12:55.389
I DON'T REMEMBER
THE NAME OF THE CHURCH.

12:58.993 --> 13:01.011
HELLO.

13:01.079 --> 13:01.979
HEY, IT'S ME.

13:02.046 --> 13:03.347
OH, HEY, HONEY.

13:03.414 --> 13:05.182
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS
NOW?

13:05.249 --> 13:06.633
I DON'T KNOW.
BUTTCRACK, KENTUCKY.

13:06.701 --> 13:08.335
BUTTCREEK.

13:09.604 --> 13:11.838
ANYWAY, I LOST THE
NAME OF THE CHURCH

13:11.906 --> 13:12.940
THAT DENISE IS GETTING
MARRIED IN.

13:13.007 --> 13:14.408
DO YOU HAVE THE PAPER THERE?

13:14.476 --> 13:15.860
UH, YEAH.
I THINK I DO.

13:15.927 --> 13:18.161
HEY, HONEY,
FUNNY STORY.

13:18.229 --> 13:19.663
I WAS AT THE MARKET
TODAY.

13:19.731 --> 13:22.633
I HAD A CART LOADED
WITH STUFF,

13:22.701 --> 13:24.434
AND THEY WOULDN'T
TAKE MY CREDIT CARD.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.670
AND HERE'S
THE FUNNY PART...

13:26.738 --> 13:28.639
THEY SAID IT WAS
MAXED OUT

13:28.706 --> 13:31.625
BECAUSE OF A CHARGE
AT A CACHINGO CASINO.

13:31.693 --> 13:34.312
REALLY?

13:34.379 --> 13:37.047
DID YOU LOSE $600?

13:37.115 --> 13:38.815
ONLY BECAUSE
OF SPLITSY AND JINXY!

13:38.883 --> 13:40.934
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?

13:41.002 --> 13:43.520
DO YOU HAVE THE NAME
OF THE CHURCH?

13:43.588 --> 13:46.190
YES, I HAVE IT. GREATER MOUNT
MORRIS FIRST PRESBYTERIAN.

13:46.258 --> 13:48.058
GREAT. THANK YOU.

13:48.126 --> 13:50.327
AND BY THE WAY, YOU DO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE DEAD, RIGHT?

13:50.395 --> 13:52.562
OH, SURE.

13:52.630 --> 13:53.564
I GOT IT.

13:53.631 --> 13:56.667
GREAT. NOW WE NEED GAS,
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

13:56.734 --> 13:58.152
I HAVE ONE MORE CREDIT CARD,

13:58.220 --> 14:00.387
BUT I'M ONLY SUPPOSED TO USE
IT IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY.

14:00.455 --> 14:02.323
IT'S GOT, LIKE,
A 30% INTEREST RATE.

14:02.390 --> 14:04.558
I THINK THIS IS
AN EMERGENCY.

14:06.928 --> 14:11.348
HEY, WE NEED A FILL-UP
ON, UH, PUMP NUMBER 3.

14:11.416 --> 14:12.849
WHOA.

14:12.917 --> 14:15.186
WE DO NOT ACCEPT VISA.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.570
WHAT?

14:16.638 --> 14:19.356
DINER'S CLUB OR SUNOCO-
EITHER ONE.

14:19.424 --> 14:21.475
IS THERE ANYPLACE AROUND
HERE THAT DOES ACCEPT IT?

14:21.543 --> 14:23.176
INDIAN CASINO UP THE ROAD.

14:35.056 --> 14:36.190
DIFFERENT CARD.

14:43.098 --> 14:44.732
DECLINED.

14:46.785 --> 14:48.386
I KNOW THE DRILL.

14:51.907 --> 14:53.173
PARDON ME.

15:05.503 --> 15:08.339
"HAPPY VALLEY PUDDING."

15:09.707 --> 15:13.110
YOU GOT A NICE PRODUCT,
MR. LUCAS.

15:13.178 --> 15:14.561
THANKS. I LIKE IT, TOO.

15:14.629 --> 15:16.496
MAYBE A BIT TOO MUCH.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.334
I'M JUST GONNA JOT DOWN
A FEW NOTES HERE

15:20.402 --> 15:21.668
WITH MY PEN.

15:21.736 --> 15:22.669
OH, MY.

15:22.737 --> 15:24.438
I SEEM TO HAVE
INADVERTENTLY

15:24.506 --> 15:28.208
GRABBED THE PEN PROVIDED
TO ME BY ROYALE PUDDING,

15:28.276 --> 15:32.046
YOUR FIERCEST COMPETITOR.

15:33.397 --> 15:34.631
THIS IS AWKWARD.

15:34.699 --> 15:35.900
HOW SO?

15:35.967 --> 15:39.269
WELL, JUST THAT IT'S
QUITE A NICE PEN.

15:39.337 --> 15:44.008
IT WOULD TAKE A STRONG MAN
NOT TO BE SEDUCED BY IT.

15:46.744 --> 15:49.412
IT'S LEAKING A LITTLE INK
ON YOUR HAND THERE.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.865
STOP BEING COY, MR. LUCAS.
YOU'RE A MAN OF THE WORLD.

15:51.933 --> 15:53.233
YOU WANT A SHOT
AT THIS ACCOUNT,

15:53.301 --> 15:56.770
START BATTING YOUR EYES
AND SHOW ME YOUR GOODIES.

15:56.838 --> 15:58.706
WHAT?!

15:58.774 --> 16:02.025
PERKS! SWAG!
START WOOING ME.

16:02.093 --> 16:03.444
UM...

16:03.511 --> 16:06.780
I HAVE A RICE PUDDING
SAMPLE,

16:06.847 --> 16:09.049
BUT IT'S BEEN IN MY CAR
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

16:09.117 --> 16:11.101
THAT'S IT?

16:11.169 --> 16:14.771
THEN WHY THE HELL ARE YOU
WASTING MY VALUABLE TIME?

16:14.839 --> 16:17.625
YOU CALLED ME!
AT HOME ON A SUNDAY!

16:17.692 --> 16:20.928
YOU KNOW WHAT?
GET OUT.

16:20.995 --> 16:22.946
LEAVE THE RICE PUDDING.

16:26.384 --> 16:28.886
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE JUST
ENTERED TENNESSEE.

16:30.421 --> 16:33.157
GOVERNOR PHIL BREDESEN
WELCOMES YOU.

16:33.224 --> 16:36.060
HEY, BREDESENYYYY!

16:36.127 --> 16:39.196
OH, GOD, THE YELLOW LIGHT ON
THE FUEL GAUGE JUST WENT ON.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.165
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S
JUST TO SCARE PEOPLE.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.933
WE COULD'VE GOTTEN GAS

16:43.000 --> 16:45.669
IF YOU GUYS HADN'T GAMBLED
AWAY ALL OUR MONEY AGAIN!

16:45.736 --> 16:47.804
SEE, THAT'S JUST
POINTING OUT A PROBLEM

16:47.872 --> 16:50.674
WITHOUT OFFERING
A SOLUTION.

16:52.377 --> 16:53.977
HEY, DEAC, UM...

16:54.045 --> 16:55.812
YOUR DAD LIVES
RIGHT ON THE WAY.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.581
COULDN'T WE ASK HIM
FOR THE GAS MONEY?

16:57.649 --> 17:00.083
LOOK, I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO SEE HIM.

17:00.151 --> 17:02.953
YOU KNOW WHAT, DEAC?
MAYBE HE'S CHANGED.

17:03.020 --> 17:06.021
MAYBE IF YOU TOLD HIM
HOW YOU FELT,

17:06.089 --> 17:08.191
YOU KNOW,
HOW HE HURT YOU,

17:08.260 --> 17:11.994
YOU GUYS COULD FORGE A
WHOLE NEW RELATIONSHIP.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.499
THAT'S RIGHT, OLD MAN.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.301
ALL I EVER WANTED WAS MY DADDY
TO TELL ME THAT HE LOVED ME.

17:18.369 --> 17:19.935
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, BOY,

17:20.003 --> 17:22.172
I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT
I EVEN AM YOUR DADDY,

17:22.240 --> 17:23.839
THE WAY YOUR MAMA
CATTED AROUND.

17:23.907 --> 17:26.277
DON'T YOU TALK
ABOUT MY MAMA!

17:26.344 --> 17:28.412
I'LL KILL YA!

17:28.480 --> 17:31.148
THEY'RE GETTING IT
ALL OUT. THAT'S GOOD.

17:32.367 --> 17:34.268
YEAH, YOU HIGHTAIL IT,
BOY.

17:34.336 --> 17:36.136
AND DON'T YOU
EVER COME BACK!

17:39.724 --> 17:41.225
LET'S GO.

17:46.364 --> 17:49.967
SO HOW DID YOU DO
MOOLAH-WISE?

17:56.341 --> 17:58.792
OK, 2 MILES AWAY.
HOW WE DOING ON GAS?

17:58.859 --> 18:00.177
W- WE'RE OK.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.128
I BEEN DOING
A LOT OF COASTING.

18:03.698 --> 18:06.934
PLEASE, GOD, IF YOU
CARE ANYTHING ABOUT ME,

18:07.001 --> 18:10.037
LET THIS CAR GO
2 MORE MILES.

18:15.977 --> 18:19.380
OK, BIG GUY
NOT A SPENCE FAN.

18:26.454 --> 18:30.124
OW!

18:31.760 --> 18:32.760
I'M COMIN', BABY.

18:32.827 --> 18:34.427
YOUR KNIGHT IN
SHINING ARM-

18:35.696 --> 18:37.897
OH, GOD! AAH!

18:37.965 --> 18:38.599
COME ON.

18:38.666 --> 18:40.517
I THINK I SPRAINED
MY ANKLE.

18:40.584 --> 18:42.152
GO ON WITHOUT ME.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.487
UM...

18:43.555 --> 18:46.290
I DON'T WANT TO
MARRY DENISE.

18:46.357 --> 18:49.442
BUT I CAN'T WALK.

18:59.871 --> 19:03.306
OW! AAH! AH!

19:13.150 --> 19:14.300
ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS IT. GO.

19:14.368 --> 19:15.368
GO!

19:21.025 --> 19:24.778
ACTUALLY, SHE'S PROBABLY
ALREADY MARRIED BY NOW.

19:24.846 --> 19:27.147
WHAT SAY WE HEAD BACK?

19:27.215 --> 19:28.215
WHAT?!

19:28.283 --> 19:30.117
YEAH, I CHANGED
MY MIND.

19:30.185 --> 19:31.352
THIS WAS FUN.

19:31.419 --> 19:32.752
Y- YOU'RE DOING THIS.

19:32.820 --> 19:35.455
WHAT IF I'M WRONG?
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T LOVE ME?

19:35.523 --> 19:36.656
YOU'RE STILL
DOING IT!

19:36.724 --> 19:37.657
OW!

19:37.725 --> 19:40.027
SPENCE, YOU
LISTEN TO ME.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.629
WE WENT THROUGH HELL
TO GET YOU HERE.

19:42.697 --> 19:46.367
I MEAN, DANNY, HE MAY
NEVER EAT SOLID FOOD AGAIN.

19:46.434 --> 19:49.269
AND I GAMBLED AWAY
A MORTGAGE PAYMENT,

19:49.337 --> 19:50.904
AND NOW I GOTTA GO HOME
AND FACE A WIFE

19:50.972 --> 19:54.141
WHO'S GONNA KICK MY ASS!

19:54.209 --> 19:56.926
AND THIS MAN-
THIS MAN IS BROKEN.

19:56.994 --> 19:58.128
TO GET YOU HERE,

19:58.195 --> 19:59.363
HE HAD TO LEARN THAT HIS
DADDY DOESN'T LOVE HIM

19:59.430 --> 20:00.664
AND HIS MAMA
SLEPT AROUND.

20:00.732 --> 20:01.665
<i>MIGHT'VE
SLEPT AROUND.</i>

20:01.733 --> 20:03.467
MIGHT'VE
SLEPT AROUND.

20:03.534 --> 20:05.034
AND WHY DID WE DO IT?

20:05.102 --> 20:07.103
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

20:07.171 --> 20:09.339
'CAUSE WE
BELIEVE IN YOU.

20:09.407 --> 20:11.157
SO THE LEAST YOU CAN DO

20:11.225 --> 20:14.478
IS BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF, TOO.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.217
LET'S STOP A WEDDING.

20:22.687 --> 20:25.822
...IN MARRIAGE, THE MOST
SACRED OF INSTITUTIONS.

20:25.890 --> 20:28.525
BUT FIRST...
IF THERE IS ANYONE HERE

20:28.593 --> 20:30.059
WHO HAS REASON TO BELIEVE

20:30.127 --> 20:33.413
THESE TWO SHOULD NOT
BE JOINED IN SACRED MATRIMONY,

20:33.480 --> 20:36.567
LET HIM SPEAK NOW
OR FOREVER HOLD HIS PEACE.

20:40.355 --> 20:41.454
I DO!

20:41.523 --> 20:44.257
I LOVE YOU,
DENISE RUTH BATTAGLIA!

20:45.860 --> 20:47.678
I LOVE YOU, TOO, TED.

20:47.745 --> 20:50.447
I'M SO SORRY, SCOTT.

21:02.410 --> 21:03.944
OH, HI, SPENCE.

21:04.011 --> 21:05.845
GLAD YOU COULD COME.

21:12.203 --> 21:13.270
HUH!

21:23.298 --> 21:26.699
SO, HOW'S EVERYONE ENJOYING
THEIR AFTER BINGO TREAT?

21:26.767 --> 21:28.769
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GETTING PUDDING.

21:28.836 --> 21:31.104
WHY ARE WE EATING
BAKED BEANS?

21:31.172 --> 21:32.789
IT'S A CHANGE OF PACE.

21:32.857 --> 21:35.559
OPEN YOUR MINDS,
YOU OLD BUZZARDS!
