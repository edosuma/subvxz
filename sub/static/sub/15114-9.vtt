Woman: I've been concerned
any improvement

00:04.606 --> 00:06.708

00:06.742 --> 00:09.177
Was Tom Kane admitted to your clinic?
I need to know.

00:09.211 --> 00:10.913
Yes.
We treated him.

00:10.947 --> 00:13.950
That bag you dropped was
light at least five grand.

00:15.553 --> 00:17.753
- Mayor Rutledge is in the hospital.
- How can I help?

00:17.754 --> 00:19.514

I want you to take her home.

00:19.758 --> 00:20.892

00:25.687 --> 00:27.207
I'm not going to answer that question.

00:27.234 --> 00:28.594
Don't you think we deserve to know

00:28.595 --> 00:29.795

00:29.803 --> 00:31.270
I made a fucking mistake.

00:31.305 --> 00:33.205
When I become the next governor,

00:33.239 --> 00:37.477
you and I will seldom coincide
legislatively or otherwise.

00:40.782 --> 00:42.016

It pains me to be the bearer of bad news.

00:45.053 --> 00:47.333
Is this really the legacy
you want to leave behind, Mac?

00:47.334 --> 00:49.691
Allowing the state's
largest city to go under?

00:49.725 --> 00:52.327
This bond acquisition vote

00:52.361 --> 00:53.928

The governor of the goddamn

02:57.361 --> 03:01.497
You...
have no idea.

03:08.905 --> 03:10.772
How is he?

03:13.309 --> 03:15.276
I'm not sure you have the right to know.

03:15.311 --> 03:17.211
Excuse me?

03:17.245 --> 03:20.013
I spoke to his nurse.
Nadeem, I believe.

03:20.048 --> 03:22.328
He suggested you could have
had something to do with it.

03:22.329 --> 03:24.551
That, for whatever reason,

03:24.585 --> 03:28.288
you may have withheld your grandfather's
medication, causing him to fall.

03:28.323 --> 03:30.557
Is that what you call it?
Medication?

03:30.592 --> 03:32.826
The doctors can't say

03:32.860 --> 03:35.095
if he'll ever come out of the coma.

03:35.129 --> 03:38.098
Hard enough seeing him
live through a stroke.

03:38.132 --> 03:40.934
You mean the one that you caused?

03:42.637 --> 03:44.571
Sorry?

03:44.605 --> 03:46.973
His stupor.
It didn't just happen.

03:47.008 --> 03:49.309
It was induced.
And you kept him that way

03:49.344 --> 03:51.946

you keep giving him.

03:51.980 --> 03:54.620

- Why did you do it?

03:54.621 --> 03:56.351

04:38.693 --> 04:41.828

Nice. How's he gonna pay

Exactly. If Kane
can't stop the bleeding,

but known and without association.

06:08.084 --> 06:10.219
<i>I'll make the call.</i>

<i>shelters, and community centers.</i>

07:58.696 --> 08:01.864
Sir, I understand your hostility
towards Alderman Ross,

08:01.899 --> 08:04.567
but his ward's already stretched

08:04.601 --> 08:06.269
in terms of public services.

08:06.303 --> 08:09.906
And he no longer has to provide them
to residents of Lennox Gardens,

08:09.940 --> 08:11.641
because there are none.

08:13.310 --> 08:15.211
At the moment.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.980
I'll notify DFSS about shuttering
those agencies right away.

08:18.014 --> 08:20.105
Smaller measures like these can help,

08:20.106 --> 08:23.386
but, with all due respect, they're a drop
in the bucket given the city's deficit.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.788
What we really need is a federal bailout.

08:25.823 --> 08:28.124
Which is why I want you in DC.

08:28.158 --> 08:29.625
I need you to push for TARP funds.

08:45.875 --> 08:49.578
Make our guests more comfortable.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.254
It was sound advice and I took it.

His biggest PAC contributor for years.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.967

God knows the State's Attorney will
do anything to get into the papers.

09:48.915 --> 09:51.715
No, I'm pretty sure Doyle got this
handed to him on a silver platter.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.041

way too much credit.

09:54.075 --> 09:56.677
And anyway, McGantry is yesterday's news.

09:56.711 --> 10:01.149
Today is all about the fact that Chicago's

10:35.584 --> 10:39.620
It's not my fault the city can't meet
its obligations on loan interests.

10:39.655 --> 10:42.390
Kane's been working
this Ponzi scheme for years.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.525
By the time the receiver gets it straight,

Unlike our mayor, I can rise again.

The city has a pension payment tomorrow
of over half a million dollars.

11:55.997 --> 11:58.666
We could save that by shutting
down select transit lines

11:58.700 --> 12:00.501

And 5:00 a.m.

12:02.103 --> 12:03.838
It'll buy us some time, anyway.

12:09.378 --> 12:12.647
Do it, but don't spare rush hour.

12:12.682 --> 12:15.417
Not a cut the public will respond well to.

12:15.451 --> 12:16.891
Perhaps you should make a statement.

12:16.892 --> 12:18.987
Last thing I want to do
is become the official face

12:19.021 --> 12:22.490
of this crisis when it is the
council that is wholly to blame.

12:22.525 --> 12:26.094
I just wish some informed insider

12:26.128 --> 12:28.763
would say the same to the press.

12:30.299 --> 12:31.666

13:01.865 --> 13:03.867
I've noticed.

13:03.901 --> 13:06.002
My family's made more than one overture.

13:06.037 --> 13:07.904
Yeah.

13:07.939 --> 13:10.174
But at the moment,

13:10.208 --> 13:13.177
Chicago is experiencing
financial difficulties.

13:13.211 --> 13:15.546
And you see an opportunity.

13:15.580 --> 13:18.215
I do.

13:22.721 --> 13:26.323
Does the mayor even know that I'm here?

13:26.358 --> 13:29.126
( Laughs ) He does.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.796
- But this was your idea?
- Mm-hmm.

13:33.131 --> 13:35.432
Yes.

13:37.736 --> 13:40.805
Well, allow me to be the first Vacarro

13:40.839 --> 13:43.174
to contribute to Tom Kane's PAC.

13:46.412 --> 13:49.114
John,

13:49.148 --> 13:51.984
now is not the time to think small.

13:55.922 --> 13:59.524
( Crowd chanting ) No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!

13:59.558 --> 14:03.161
No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!

14:03.196 --> 14:05.663
- ( Horns honking )
- No more cutbacks!

14:05.698 --> 14:08.099
<i>( Phone ringing )</i>

14:08.134 --> 14:11.236
( Chanting continues )

14:14.640 --> 14:16.374
( Phone ringing )

14:16.409 --> 14:17.675
<i>Recording:
This is Ian Todd.</i>

14:17.710 --> 14:19.270
<i>Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

14:19.271 --> 14:20.578
<i>- ( Line beeps )
- It's Emma.</i>

14:20.613 --> 14:24.149
You need to come here right away.

14:24.183 --> 14:26.284
They've locked me in.

14:26.318 --> 14:28.119
I have to see you.
I need you.

14:28.154 --> 14:30.394
<i>- ( Beeps )
- If you are satisfied with your message...</i>

14:30.395 --> 14:33.091
Protesters: No more cutbacks!
No more cutbacks!

14:33.125 --> 14:35.059
No more cutbacks!

14:35.094 --> 14:36.895
Mr. Todd!
Mr. Todd!

14:36.929 --> 14:39.431
Any comment on the deficit that
stands to bankrupt the city?

14:39.465 --> 14:42.368
Um, yes.

14:42.402 --> 14:43.936
I do, actually.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.730
Having worked with several
council members,

14:45.731 --> 14:47.474
I'm struck by the lack of responsibility

14:47.508 --> 14:49.442
being taken by its leadership
in this crisis.

14:49.477 --> 14:52.478
No less than a month ago, all 50 aldermen

14:52.512 --> 14:54.413
approved pay raises for themselves.

14:54.447 --> 14:57.816
But when the mayor needed help in
balancing the budget, they refused.

14:57.851 --> 15:01.253
Now they're off the radar
while public services are cut,

15:01.288 --> 15:04.357
citizens suffer, and an emergency manager

15:04.391 --> 15:07.194
with a six-figure salary
is appointed.

15:07.228 --> 15:10.330
Where's the democracy in that?

15:10.365 --> 15:11.665
Excuse me.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.467
<i>( Chanting continues ) No more cutbacks!</i>

15:13.501 --> 15:16.970
What qualifies someone,
do you suppose, to run a city?

15:17.005 --> 15:19.106
Mr. Kane, out of respect
for your position,

15:19.140 --> 15:21.441
I came here after hours
so as not to cause any...

15:21.476 --> 15:23.544
<i>Did you study law?</i>

15:23.578 --> 15:27.514
Economics?
Get elected?

15:27.549 --> 15:30.618
My team is here to ensure a
smooth transition of power.

15:30.652 --> 15:34.255
The fact is, no matter how
much money you move around

15:34.289 --> 15:37.124
or how many light switches you
turn off or jobs you eliminate,

15:37.159 --> 15:39.193
the city will default.

15:39.228 --> 15:42.430
<i>And because that is
the reality of the situation,</i>

15:42.464 --> 15:45.232
I wanted to give you the opportunity
to speak with your unions

15:45.267 --> 15:48.102
before I cut pensions
and cancel contracts.

15:50.973 --> 15:53.340
Do you really think

15:53.375 --> 15:57.478
I'd allow the likes of you
to take this from me?

15:57.513 --> 16:01.616
<i>A bean counter?
A shyster?</i>

16:01.650 --> 16:03.730
Someone who has more regard
for the almighty dollar

16:03.731 --> 16:05.854
than the people of this city.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.392
Short of a miracle,
I'll be back in two days.

16:32.247 --> 16:33.848
I'll see you then.

16:43.825 --> 16:45.225
Hope to be your next governor.

16:45.242 --> 16:47.162
Your campaign's been
on quite a roller coaster.

16:47.163 --> 16:49.963
With the positive press you've gotten
since your mea culpa interview,

16:49.964 --> 16:52.004
think you still have a shot
at winning the office?

16:52.005 --> 16:54.116
Absolutely.
Because I still care about Illinois.

16:54.117 --> 16:56.117
Which is why I didn't
approve the mayor's request

16:56.118 --> 16:57.678
for a state-funded bailout.
Thank you.

16:57.679 --> 16:59.599
Mr. Kane's played a big part
in your candidacy.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.920
- Has that changed?
- Well, he knows, as State Treasurer,

17:01.942 --> 17:04.511
I have a fiscal responsibility
to each and every taxpayer.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.413
So in good conscience I can't saddle them

17:06.446 --> 17:08.080
with a debt incurred in a single city.

17:08.116 --> 17:10.636
And how are the people of Chicago
supposed to feel about that?

17:10.637 --> 17:12.752
Well, they should be angry.
And I don't blame them.

17:12.787 --> 17:15.222
They shouldn't have to feel
the pain of mismanagement.

17:15.256 --> 17:17.656
And people can think what
they want about me personally,

17:17.691 --> 17:20.327
but my record will show I have
tremendous fiscal discipline.

17:20.361 --> 17:23.029
Hi, how are you? Thank you so much.
Good to meet you.

17:23.064 --> 17:25.098
Hi, nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.

17:25.132 --> 17:26.679
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi. Good.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.200
- Thank you so much for your support.
- Nice to see you again.

17:29.204 --> 17:31.244
Yes, great to see you.
Thank you for your support.

17:31.245 --> 17:32.645
Thank you so much for your support.

17:32.646 --> 17:34.407
Let's wrap this up, okay?
Thanks, folks.

17:34.442 --> 17:35.875
See you at the polls.

17:35.909 --> 17:37.510
City's closing this line down anyway.

17:41.714 --> 17:43.949
What you're suggesting is unprecedented.

17:43.983 --> 17:45.617
Worked for the auto industry.

17:45.651 --> 17:47.385
That was corporate.

17:47.419 --> 17:51.223
You are talking about using TARP
funds to buy up municipal debt.

17:51.257 --> 17:53.658
The mayor's hoping the
Treasury will be pragmatic.

17:53.693 --> 17:56.728
We go down, it's not just
Chicago that feels the pain.

17:56.762 --> 17:58.463
Not pragmatic to open the door,

17:58.497 --> 18:02.067
allowing every distressed city
to claim our limited funds.

18:02.101 --> 18:05.203
Illinois' 20 electoral votes.

18:06.740 --> 18:09.708
It is unclear that a weakened
Kane can deliver that.

18:09.743 --> 18:12.812
Can we get the mayor on
the phone with the secretary

18:12.846 --> 18:14.547
to discuss our proposal?

18:24.859 --> 18:26.699
Why don't you just
fucking roll over and die?

18:26.700 --> 18:28.295
Sorry, I told him...

18:28.329 --> 18:30.731
Nice to see you, too, William.

18:30.765 --> 18:32.366
You want this city to suffer,

18:32.400 --> 18:34.701
at least have the decency
to spread it around,

18:34.735 --> 18:37.203
not just gut my ward, which as you know,

18:37.238 --> 18:39.372
don't have much to begin with.

18:39.406 --> 18:42.008
- Why?
- Why what?

18:42.042 --> 18:43.843
This?

18:43.878 --> 18:46.146
Don't you care about your constituents?

18:46.180 --> 18:47.847
The people you were elected to serve?

18:47.882 --> 18:51.953
Do you want to see them
at the mercy of an outsider?

18:54.957 --> 18:57.058
As opposed to you?

19:02.364 --> 19:06.300
You are not that petty or stupid.

19:06.334 --> 19:08.235
( Chuckles )

19:10.838 --> 19:14.007
Your time has come.

19:14.042 --> 19:16.242
<i>Our time.</i>

19:18.846 --> 19:21.615
Years of bloody battle between us,

19:21.649 --> 19:25.518
now we both lose to a third party.

19:27.788 --> 19:30.457
You're the one who
pushed it over the edge.

19:31.993 --> 19:33.660
With that.

19:37.065 --> 19:40.067
That, Alderman...

19:41.570 --> 19:43.738
can save us both.

19:48.811 --> 19:51.779
<i>- ( Music playing on radio )
- ( Phone ringing )</i>

20:00.855 --> 20:01.922
Hey, Roxie.

20:05.860 --> 20:08.595
A little bit of this
for a little bit of that?

20:14.202 --> 20:17.171
It's Meredith Kane.
How are you?

20:17.205 --> 20:19.006
<i>Mac: I'm just fine.
Thanks for asking.</i>

20:19.041 --> 20:22.643
Funny you should call.
The wife asked about you just last night.

20:22.678 --> 20:25.480
Oh, give my best to Edie.

20:25.514 --> 20:27.983
Mac, I know you're busy,
but if at all possible,

20:28.017 --> 20:29.785
I'd love to meet you for lunch.

20:29.819 --> 20:32.688
<i>- You here in Springfield?
- No, in Chicago.</i>

20:32.722 --> 20:35.024
But I could have you flown in
on a friend's private jet.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.559
We could chat.

20:36.593 --> 20:38.361
Last time we did

20:38.395 --> 20:40.930
resulted in a steep National Guard bill.

20:40.964 --> 20:43.465
No, this won't cost a thing.

20:43.500 --> 20:47.335
I'll have you back in Springfield
in a couple of hours.

20:47.370 --> 20:48.937
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.441
Never pass on a free lunch.

20:52.476 --> 20:54.977
( Chuckles )
Wonderful. I'll see you soon.

20:57.147 --> 21:00.249
You really do smooth out
my rough edges, don't you?

21:07.790 --> 21:10.759
( Door creaks, bangs )

21:18.433 --> 21:20.701
Hello?

21:22.771 --> 21:25.239
You weren't lying when you
said someplace out of the way.

21:25.274 --> 21:28.009
Well, I can't be too careful
with the goods that I got.

21:28.043 --> 21:29.643
I like the sound of that.

21:29.678 --> 21:33.414
Your suspicions about Ezra
Stone are not unfounded.

21:35.350 --> 21:37.151
Meaning it was an inside job.

21:37.186 --> 21:39.754
Gotta be some terms here
if you want the full story.

21:41.524 --> 21:43.725
You know, last time
I saw you, you were barside

21:43.759 --> 21:45.594
with Kane's pal from the O'Hare ceremony.

21:45.628 --> 21:48.229
Kind of seemed like you guys
were part of the same fan club.

21:48.264 --> 21:49.764
Past tense.

21:49.799 --> 21:52.600
Look, CPD's been doing
Kane's dirty work for years.

21:52.634 --> 21:55.536
Then he turns around and scrapes
Royczyk like shit from his shoe.

21:55.571 --> 21:57.192
Now he's eyeballing our pension funds

21:57.193 --> 21:58.673
to keep the city from going belly up.

21:58.707 --> 22:00.775
You'll go on record?

22:00.809 --> 22:02.710
For 10,000 bucks.

22:02.744 --> 22:04.745
We don't pay for stories.

22:04.780 --> 22:06.460
<i>Well, you don't get 'em this good, either.</i>

22:06.461 --> 22:09.183
What, toxic waste
in Bensenville? Please.

22:09.218 --> 22:12.453
The "Sentinel" is a paper of record,
detective Dinovo, not a tabloid.

22:12.487 --> 22:14.167
Yeah, and I'm a man without retirement pay

22:14.168 --> 22:15.789
who needs to leave town if I go public.

22:15.824 --> 22:18.425
I'd say 10 grand was a bargain.
Take it or leave it.

22:18.460 --> 22:20.260
There's more to tell.

22:26.567 --> 22:27.867
<i>( Door slams )</i>

22:27.901 --> 22:31.270
<i>( Muffled voices speaking within )</i>

22:31.305 --> 22:33.372
...that's not
what she said to me...

22:33.407 --> 22:35.241
Hey, I don't blame you.

22:35.275 --> 22:37.543
Afternoon, gentlemen.

22:37.577 --> 22:39.678
Mr. Taylor.

22:41.248 --> 22:44.083
Come here, man.
It's good to see you, man.

22:44.117 --> 22:45.584
- It's good to be seen.
- Yeah.

22:45.619 --> 22:47.720
How you doing?

22:47.754 --> 22:50.623
Fine now that charges
against me got dropped.

22:50.657 --> 22:52.959
I'm grateful for everything
you did in that regard.

22:52.993 --> 22:55.128
You kept your head
when you were in custody.

22:55.162 --> 22:59.466
That kind of loyalty is
something I very much value.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.568
Of course it is.

23:02.637 --> 23:05.740
So the Gardens are done for a while,

23:05.774 --> 23:08.176
but I'd imagine you still
need some help in the field.

23:08.210 --> 23:11.714
I understand young brother covered
for me while I was gone, but...

23:11.748 --> 23:13.415
Trey, go down the hall, get us some ice.

23:13.450 --> 23:15.618
I want to fix the ward boss a drink,

23:15.652 --> 23:17.687
<i>catch him up on things.</i>

23:17.721 --> 23:19.222
<i>Trey:
All right.</i>

23:21.391 --> 23:23.359
<i>Kenya: How your family, man?
Everybody good?</i>

23:23.393 --> 23:24.627
<i>Everybody's good.</i>

23:24.661 --> 23:26.762
You had sex with Treasurer Zajac?

23:26.797 --> 23:30.700
Oral.
In his office.

23:30.734 --> 23:33.002
That part was okay with me.

23:33.036 --> 23:36.338
But then he eliminated my
internship, which was way not okay.

23:36.372 --> 23:39.207
And when I saw him on the street,

23:39.241 --> 23:42.043
he pretended he didn't know me.

23:42.077 --> 23:43.744
( Scoffs )

23:43.779 --> 23:45.512
Wow.

23:45.547 --> 23:47.047
He's just a hypocrite,

23:47.081 --> 23:49.783
telling people he's only had one affair.

23:49.817 --> 23:52.085
It's a lie.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.221
Patty, I get why you want
to hold him accountable.

23:54.255 --> 23:57.324
I do. It's a completely
healthy reaction.

23:58.893 --> 24:01.061
But if you go public with this,

24:01.096 --> 24:02.896
you will be savaged.

24:02.930 --> 24:04.965
You will be painted as a slut.

24:04.999 --> 24:06.667
He will deny it, say you're delusional,

24:06.701 --> 24:10.103
and everyone will believe him.

24:10.138 --> 24:12.506
Don't throw your future away on this.

24:14.075 --> 24:15.710
He's not worth it.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.716
I really thought you'd be on my side.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.384
I need a breakdown ward by ward.

24:23.419 --> 24:26.154
Get me the southeast first.

24:33.229 --> 24:36.498
I am.
Just sleep on this, okay?

24:36.532 --> 24:38.033
Give it some thought.

24:38.067 --> 24:40.635
Call me tomorrow and we'll talk about it.

24:43.173 --> 24:45.441
Okay.

24:54.084 --> 24:55.819
So what was that all about?

24:55.853 --> 24:58.355
Oh, she used to work for Zajac.

24:58.389 --> 25:01.124
She's looking for a new job,

25:01.159 --> 25:03.994
but we don't have any space for her.

25:18.210 --> 25:21.012
Getting too old for this shit.

25:21.046 --> 25:23.147
Description, location,

25:23.181 --> 25:25.149
compensation.

25:25.183 --> 25:27.451
Tonight.

25:34.093 --> 25:35.693
I'm meeting with Senator Carter later.

25:35.728 --> 25:38.930
<i>If we can get assurances that
banking won't go after them,</i>

25:38.964 --> 25:40.565
<i>maybe we can get the Fed to help.</i>

25:40.599 --> 25:42.267
Good, keep at it.

25:42.301 --> 25:43.535
How are things going there?

25:43.569 --> 25:45.771
A day from shutting down schools.

25:47.474 --> 25:48.941
I'll keep you posted.

25:50.511 --> 25:53.113
You may be my only hope.

26:07.394 --> 26:10.597
Mac's quite affable, though he and
my husband have had their moments.

26:10.631 --> 26:13.700
Which is why you're here
and not the mayor himself.

26:13.734 --> 26:16.302
As you can imagine, he's quite busy.

26:16.337 --> 26:18.138
And I do play a role.

26:18.172 --> 26:21.775
Oh, it's quite clear how much
political power you have, Meredith.

26:21.810 --> 26:22.943
( Chuckles )

26:32.755 --> 26:34.323
( Laughs ) Mac.

26:34.357 --> 26:37.660
A fella could get used to this.

26:37.694 --> 26:40.463
Mac, this is John Vacarro.

26:40.497 --> 26:41.797
John, Mac Cullen.

26:42.833 --> 26:45.534
So, what's for lunch?

26:45.569 --> 26:47.303
( Laughs ) Let's go.

26:53.309 --> 26:54.909
<i>John: I'm not much of
a gambler myself,</i>

26:54.910 --> 26:57.012
<i>but the track has proven
to be a solid investment.</i>

26:57.046 --> 26:59.647
<i>People seem to enjoy it.
Bought it several years ago.</i>

26:59.682 --> 27:02.383
Put in a global pari-mutuel
betting system.

27:02.418 --> 27:03.951
Been a moneymaker ever since.

27:03.986 --> 27:06.053
Very nice.
As is the box.

27:06.088 --> 27:08.355
Nothing quite like it in Springfield.

27:08.389 --> 27:10.724
Excuse me.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.659
Mrs. Kane.

27:12.694 --> 27:14.595
Meredith, are you all right?

27:14.629 --> 27:16.897
Yeah, I just needed to sit for a second.

27:16.932 --> 27:19.767
Shall we cut to the chase
before the horses do?

27:19.801 --> 27:21.969
Absolutely.

27:22.003 --> 27:25.539
McGantry's property
surrounding Lennox Gardens.

27:25.573 --> 27:27.841
- Now owned by the state.
- Go on.

27:27.876 --> 27:31.111
I buy it at market value plus 5%.

27:31.145 --> 27:34.614
Do you? Shouldn't that be phrased
as a question, Mr. Vacarro?

27:34.649 --> 27:37.517
- ( Meredith chuckles )
- We both know market value these days

27:37.552 --> 27:39.019
<i>is a turd with a price tag.</i>

27:39.054 --> 27:42.089
Three years ago, McGantry
bought that same real estate

27:42.124 --> 27:43.691
for a hell of a lot more than that.

27:43.725 --> 27:45.626
That was then, Mac.

27:45.661 --> 27:47.929
And this is now, I suppose.

27:47.963 --> 27:50.566
We take the guarantee to the banks

27:50.600 --> 27:52.568
<i>as collateral for emergency loans.</i>

27:52.602 --> 27:55.371
You come out looking like
the savior of Chicago.

27:55.405 --> 27:56.806
Jesus.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.108
Someone get me a pair
of tights and a cape.

27:59.142 --> 28:02.044
- Is that my new identity since the riots?
- Meredith: Why not?

28:02.078 --> 28:05.381
Think I'll get a chance to place
a bet before I have to go?

28:11.154 --> 28:13.022
Meme.

28:13.056 --> 28:16.025
<i>- ( Car approaching )
- ( Speaking softly )</i>

28:16.059 --> 28:18.327
( Music playing within )

28:21.665 --> 28:23.432
Hey, hey.

28:23.466 --> 28:25.400
Hard man to find, huh, cuz?

28:25.435 --> 28:28.136
Just been working
in different places, man.

28:28.171 --> 28:31.473
Hmm, sound about right.

28:31.508 --> 28:33.988
You wouldn't be thinking of
running off on me now, would you?

28:33.989 --> 28:35.644
<i>I will find you.</i>

28:35.678 --> 28:37.412
I ain't going nowhere, bro.

28:37.447 --> 28:39.815
I'm just building my business back up.

28:39.849 --> 28:41.617
I got a little now if you want it.

28:41.651 --> 28:43.351
The fuck is that?

28:43.386 --> 28:45.620
<i>( Chuckles )</i>

28:45.654 --> 28:47.455
5K is some serious paper, man.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.090
And I ain't got 10 years to wait on you.

28:49.124 --> 28:52.193
Have all my money today or we got issues.

28:53.763 --> 28:55.864
You know I ain't got that shit, man.

28:59.769 --> 29:01.936
Hey, look, tell me something, man.

29:01.971 --> 29:04.239
Really.

29:04.273 --> 29:06.441
That little white girl worth all this?

29:07.743 --> 29:10.478
Man, I'm done with that bitch.

29:10.512 --> 29:12.046
Look at the man.

29:12.081 --> 29:14.315
He done with her...

29:14.350 --> 29:17.085
and yet the debt remains.

29:18.821 --> 29:21.590
So tell me, what we gonna do about that?

29:29.066 --> 29:31.100
What's up with the Zajac volunteer?

29:31.134 --> 29:34.737
Oh, she was inexperienced.
We don't need her.

29:34.771 --> 29:37.606
You're lying.
Why?

29:37.640 --> 29:39.074
I'm not.

29:39.108 --> 29:40.809
If another one's come out of the woodwork,

29:40.843 --> 29:42.410
why aren't we running with it?

29:44.613 --> 29:46.113
Catherine, it's gilding the lily.

29:46.148 --> 29:47.468
<i>Tina:
Not when he's trending up.</i>

29:47.469 --> 29:49.816
Proof that it was more than
one affair could finish him.

29:49.851 --> 29:51.852
If you've got something
on Zajac, I want it.

29:51.887 --> 29:54.121
So either he banged the fat chick

29:54.155 --> 29:56.790
or she's mad he didn't bang her.
Which is it?

29:58.359 --> 30:01.495
She's just a kid, okay?
If we go public...

30:01.529 --> 30:03.630
This is my fourth run.

30:03.664 --> 30:06.566
I don't give a shit
about collateral damage.

30:08.853 --> 30:10.688
But the meeting was set.

30:10.722 --> 30:13.357
- He can't see you. I'm sorry.
- Can't or won't?

30:13.391 --> 30:15.993
Carter's been waiting 15 years
to get the gavel on banking.

30:16.027 --> 30:17.427
He's not gonna give it up for this.

30:17.428 --> 30:18.996
He owes his career to Kane.

30:19.030 --> 30:22.132
You think he can get by without
Cook County next primary?

30:22.166 --> 30:24.835
Look, everyone's watching Walsh/Zajac

30:24.869 --> 30:26.736
and thinking maybe Kane's
finally irrelevant.

30:26.771 --> 30:28.705
She wins, his pull evaporates.

30:28.739 --> 30:32.041
People forget a fundamental truth.

30:32.076 --> 30:34.577
Tom Kane always finds a way.

30:34.611 --> 30:36.171
The further you back him into a corner,

30:36.180 --> 30:39.115
the more painful the cuts
when he fights his way out.

30:40.384 --> 30:42.385
I'm sorry.

30:43.521 --> 30:45.789
( Sighs )

30:49.761 --> 30:52.863
After all this, I'm getting no?

30:52.898 --> 30:56.200
( Laughs ) Welcome to politics.

30:56.234 --> 30:58.536
You might wish you'd stayed out.

30:59.805 --> 31:03.108
Thanks, you two, but I need to get going.

31:03.142 --> 31:05.811
Need to check in with Borden
before it gets too late.

31:05.845 --> 31:08.146
- Sorry you couldn't stay longer, Governor.
- Ah.

31:08.181 --> 31:10.216
With only a few months left in office,

31:10.250 --> 31:13.218
I'm sure Mac wants to make
the most of them.

31:13.253 --> 31:17.222
Tell Tom I wish him
the best with this thing.

31:17.257 --> 31:19.291
I really do.

31:19.326 --> 31:20.760
Will do.

31:20.794 --> 31:22.896
Which way to the jet?

31:32.207 --> 31:34.075
( Dial tone beeping )

31:34.109 --> 31:36.777
( Ringing )

31:36.811 --> 31:39.280
<i>Tom:
Tell me.</i>

31:39.314 --> 31:41.382
He's not on board.

31:41.416 --> 31:44.952
They say a mule will labor 10 years

31:44.986 --> 31:46.887
willingly and patiently

31:46.921 --> 31:49.723
for the privilege
of kicking you just once.

31:49.757 --> 31:52.225
He wants more than that.

31:52.260 --> 31:54.661
Yeah.
Speak later.

31:57.765 --> 32:00.100
<i>Payroll for sanitation won't
be met without more cuts.</i>

32:00.135 --> 32:02.236
At this point,

32:02.270 --> 32:04.872
we're at mandated furloughs
for nonessential city workers.

32:08.576 --> 32:10.844
- Any word from Mona?
- Nothing encouraging.

32:13.782 --> 32:15.850
Sir, is it possible that...

32:15.884 --> 32:18.585
will we lose control of the city?

32:25.293 --> 32:27.660
I want this delivered by hand...

32:29.263 --> 32:31.297
to Governor Cullen.

32:31.332 --> 32:34.934
I believe Governor Cullen is out
of the office until tomorrow.

32:34.969 --> 32:37.436
Then deliver it as soon as possible,

32:37.471 --> 32:40.506
God damn it.

32:43.043 --> 32:44.711
Yes, sir.

32:44.745 --> 32:47.914
Mr. Mayor, just thought
you should know,

32:47.949 --> 32:51.351
<i>the emergency manager is meeting with her
advance team in the conference room.</i>

32:52.887 --> 32:55.021
10% across-the-board
layoffs aren't enough.

32:55.055 --> 32:57.256
We'll need at least 18.

32:57.291 --> 32:59.492
It has not been two days.

32:59.527 --> 33:01.494
You are interlopers here

33:01.529 --> 33:03.730
because of my hospitality.
I want you to leave now.

33:03.764 --> 33:06.567
First off, this advance team
is here by order of the state.

33:06.601 --> 33:09.136
- And in 24 hours...
- Get out!

33:09.170 --> 33:11.538
You!

33:12.674 --> 33:14.208
You're postponing the inevitable.

33:22.816 --> 33:25.351
She's wrong.

33:51.313 --> 33:53.515
<i>( Bushes rustling )</i>

33:55.718 --> 33:58.253
- Are you out of your mind?
- I wanted to see you.

33:58.287 --> 34:00.889
Here, in the middle of nowhere,

34:00.924 --> 34:02.925
after not calling me for days?

34:02.959 --> 34:04.727
Yeah, I know I've been out of touch.

34:04.761 --> 34:06.428
No word, no explanation.
Nothing.

34:06.463 --> 34:09.130
Kane has a brain disease.

34:09.152 --> 34:11.032
I was tracking that
before Rosebud came along.

34:11.067 --> 34:12.907
Reason I was over
the border when you called?

34:12.940 --> 34:14.501
That's where he was during the riots...

34:14.502 --> 34:17.706
an experimental treatment
center just outside of Toronto.

34:17.739 --> 34:22.543
My gut says that Stone knew
about the illness as well,

34:22.578 --> 34:24.445
saw that Kane was unfit for office,

34:24.480 --> 34:27.348
so he leaks the Bensenville
story under the name Rosebud.

34:27.382 --> 34:31.485
Kane ultimately finds out
about it and kills him for it.

34:31.520 --> 34:35.489
The burglary gone bad, which every other
paper in town seems so ready to print...

34:35.523 --> 34:37.563
I've got the lead detective
ready to go on record,

34:37.563 --> 34:40.164
say the whole damn thing was a
cover-up as long as I pay for it.

34:40.194 --> 34:42.862
Now I'm not exactly ready
to bite that fucking bullet,

34:42.897 --> 34:44.563
but, goddamn, I mean, we've got him.

34:44.599 --> 34:47.000
- We've got Kane by the balls.
- We?

34:48.168 --> 34:50.036
Yeah, you told me Rosebud was Stone.

34:50.071 --> 34:53.808
<i>I did not. I told you
it may be Stone.</i>

34:53.842 --> 34:57.845
<i>May be. And I told you, Sam.
No one else.</i>

34:57.880 --> 35:00.581
So don't even fucking think
about using my name, okay?

35:00.616 --> 35:02.583
Look, he can't touch you
from a prison cell.

35:02.618 --> 35:04.052
That's exactly where he's going.

35:04.086 --> 35:05.820
You think Kane is blinded by ambition?

35:05.855 --> 35:07.535
You may want to take a look in the mirror.

35:07.536 --> 35:08.589
Oh, Jesus.

35:08.624 --> 35:10.784
Fucking me isn't enough?
Now you're gonna analyze me?

35:10.785 --> 35:12.193
Excuse me?

35:12.227 --> 35:13.761
<i>Wow.</i>

35:13.795 --> 35:16.197
Look, I didn't mean that.

35:16.231 --> 35:18.499
Don't use my name.

35:20.569 --> 35:22.403
I'm gonna use your name anyway.

35:22.437 --> 35:24.105
You'll be subpoenaed.

35:24.139 --> 35:26.941
Do it.
I'll deny everything.

35:26.976 --> 35:30.411
Oh, and by the way...
fuck you!

35:36.885 --> 35:39.653
Tina: You know, you just...
you can't trust her.

35:39.688 --> 35:41.355
I think we can.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.725
Defending that kid today was a
big move for her as a person.

35:44.759 --> 35:47.729
Since when do you give a damn
about Kitty as a person?

35:47.763 --> 35:49.264
Take it easy.

35:49.298 --> 35:53.201
Good news is, we want another
Zajac scandal, we got it.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.369
Yeah, no thanks to her.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.571
- I need a cigarette.
- No, you don't.

35:57.606 --> 36:00.774
Sit down.
Sit down.

36:00.809 --> 36:03.377
She knows people, so what?

36:03.411 --> 36:06.480
She does.
You know me.

36:10.385 --> 36:12.385
I'll be back in a minute.

36:17.625 --> 36:20.027
Senator Walsh?

36:20.061 --> 36:21.595
<i>Just wanted to say</i>

36:21.629 --> 36:24.431
congratulations on your campaign.

36:24.466 --> 36:27.301

36:27.335 --> 36:29.455
Well, thank you so much.
Let's see if we can make it

36:29.456 --> 36:31.171
to the governor's office this time, huh?

36:31.206 --> 36:33.473
- Yeah.
- Thanks again.

- Would you mind if I...

36:57.000 --> 36:58.634
Go home.

36:58.668 --> 37:01.637
Would you like me to
arrange for your car to...

37:01.671 --> 37:03.839
It's a sailor's term

37:03.873 --> 37:06.508
for being overtaken by misfortune.

37:08.378 --> 37:13.182
"Hard up in a clinch and no
knife to cut the seizing."

37:19.557 --> 37:21.725
I'm not going anywhere.

37:26.964 --> 37:28.465
You're dismissed.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.767
Yes, sir.

37:38.276 --> 37:40.110
( Sighs )

37:55.460 --> 37:56.794
Where's Trey?

37:56.828 --> 37:58.948
I don't know, man.
But he asked me to talk to you...

37:58.949 --> 38:00.765
To what?
Waste my fucking time?

38:00.799 --> 38:04.035
A few weeks in a suit and
he's a player now? Tell him...

38:04.069 --> 38:06.189
Hold up, nigga.
I'm here to tell you something, man.

38:06.190 --> 38:08.907
- That right?
- He wants you gone, right?

38:08.941 --> 38:11.443
So we got one way you can do it,

38:11.477 --> 38:13.211
or we got another.

38:13.246 --> 38:16.181
( Laughing )

38:19.686 --> 38:21.554
Are you serious?

38:21.588 --> 38:24.090
You think you can just get up
in my car and threaten me?

38:24.125 --> 38:25.685
I'm trying to do you a favor here, bro.

38:25.719 --> 38:28.399
And I'm gonna do you one by not
punching you in your goddamn face.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.481
Get the fuck out.

38:29.482 --> 38:31.362
If you don't do this,
he'll kill us both, man.

38:31.363 --> 38:33.803
- I promise you that.
- I ain't scared of that motherfucker.

38:33.804 --> 38:36.044
- And sure as hell ain't scared of you.
- Keep talking.

52:26.708 --> 52:28.576
Not what he wanted.

52:28.610 --> 52:30.845
And you weren't gonna win, Ben.

52:30.879 --> 52:33.881
We all but bought Cook County.

52:36.619 --> 52:38.686
What'll she do?
Walsh.

52:40.389 --> 52:42.590
Open a homicide investigation.

52:42.625 --> 52:44.860
Not much else she can do.

52:47.129 --> 52:48.963
You're gonna be the next governor.

52:51.334 --> 52:53.501
He owns you.

53:04.414 --> 53:06.415
Kane:
There you are.

53:09.719 --> 53:12.521
So, what do you want to do?

53:14.790 --> 53:16.624
You know what I want.

53:16.659 --> 53:19.127
Not this.

53:20.596 --> 53:22.163
What do you want to do now?

53:24.166 --> 53:27.670
Those TARP funds you had me chasing,

53:27.704 --> 53:30.106
we were never gonna get them, were we?

53:32.276 --> 53:36.146
You just wanted me out of the
way so you could do this.

53:38.215 --> 53:40.316
You have a daughter, yes?

53:42.253 --> 53:44.020
Mine's 10.

53:46.257 --> 53:48.358
It always mattered very much to me

53:48.392 --> 53:52.362
that she was
proud... of me.

53:52.396 --> 53:54.765
What I do.

53:56.300 --> 53:58.836
And yet, I'm still here.

53:58.870 --> 54:02.740
<i>So I must be lying to someone.</i>

54:06.144 --> 54:08.846
<i>And what about you?</i>

54:08.880 --> 54:11.883
Who are you lying to?

54:13.286 --> 54:17.122
There was no political upside
to the promises you made.

54:17.157 --> 54:21.694
So either you give a shit
and you pussied out,

54:21.728 --> 54:24.964
or you're a motherfucking lunatic!

54:29.036 --> 54:31.403
( Snaps ) Which is it, Tom?

54:49.822 --> 54:52.757
Your naiveté was charming for a time,

54:52.791 --> 54:55.293
Ms. Fredricks.

54:58.296 --> 55:00.431
Even enchanting.

55:02.734 --> 55:04.435
I wondered what it would feel like

55:04.469 --> 55:06.437
to bask in the admiration

55:06.471 --> 55:09.407
of someone so pure of intent.

55:13.345 --> 55:15.813
It was nice.

55:18.116 --> 55:20.384
But now I know.

55:22.387 --> 55:23.854
Don't bother to collect your things.

55:23.889 --> 55:25.956
I'll have someone send them along.

55:29.193 --> 55:32.296
Oh, and give my best to Bitsy.

55:36.567 --> 55:39.668
I'm sure she's very proud of you.

55:58.954 --> 56:01.422
Miss.

56:01.456 --> 56:04.225
- Yes?
- If you wouldn't mind.

56:10.166 --> 56:11.600
What is this about?

56:11.634 --> 56:13.702
<i>Doyle:
Get in!</i>

56:15.037 --> 56:17.106
Now!
