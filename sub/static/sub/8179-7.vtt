OWN LOGO INTO THE MEAT.

01:19.729 --> 01:21.963

01:22.031 --> 01:23.398
STUPIDEST THING

01:25.818 --> 01:28.119
SEARED RIGHT

GONNA LOVE HIM?

01:47.540 --> 01:48.689
CARRIE,
THERE ARE NO WORDS.

01:48.757 --> 01:50.058
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
NOT EVEN AT AN APPOINTMENT.

01:50.126 --> 01:52.260
IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE HAVING LUNCH.

01:52.328 --> 01:53.895
I CAN'T WAIT.

01:53.962 --> 01:56.464

01:56.532 --> 01:57.599

01:57.666 --> 01:59.934
THEY KEEP THEIR OFFICES AT 18 DEGREES.

WAS ACTUALLY ON THE PHONE,

02:02.538 --> 02:05.039

02:28.597 --> 02:29.530
AAH!

02:29.598 --> 02:31.566
OH, GOD!

02:31.634 --> 02:34.786
THAT'S IT! WE'RE

02:34.854 --> 02:36.938
WE DON'T NEED A NEW GRILL.

UH... YEAH. SURE.

03:07.870 --> 03:10.655
COOL. ANOTHER TIME, THEN.

03:10.723 --> 03:12.239
ANYWAY, I DON'T
WANNA HOLD YOU UP.

03:12.307 --> 03:13.775
JUST WANTED YOU GUYS

03:13.842 --> 03:16.443

03:38.751 --> 03:42.369
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? YOU PUT
WEEDS INTO PEOPLE'S GARDENS?

03:42.437 --> 03:44.054
NO, NO. I TAKE 'EM OUT.
IT'S A GOOD THING.

03:44.122 --> 03:46.474
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WANNA
CALL ATTENTION TO WEEDS?

03:46.542 --> 03:48.660
OK, YOU'RE OVERTHINKING IT. IT'S CATCHY.

03:48.727 --> 03:50.028

DO YOU HAVE A GIFT
SHOP HERE OR SOMETHING?

04:39.461 --> 04:40.862
HEY, YOU'RE FUNNY.

04:40.930 --> 04:45.599

04:47.469 --> 04:49.303
THANK YOU.

05:00.715 --> 05:01.883
AND SHE
CAN USE THE TIME

05:01.950 --> 05:04.068
TO FIND ANOTHER
GYNECOLOGIST.

05:04.136 --> 05:06.254
SO, CARRIE,

05:06.322 --> 05:08.340
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR ME,

05:08.407 --> 05:10.608
OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS?

05:10.676 --> 05:14.479
WELL, I'M GUESSING I SHOULDN'T
BE LATE FOR MY NEXT APPOINTMENT.

05:14.546 --> 05:16.297
IT'S NOT IDEAL.

05:16.365 --> 05:20.134
OK. LET ME JUST MAKE A FEW
NOTES IN YOUR CHART HERE.

05:20.201 --> 05:21.152
ALL RIGHT.

05:21.303 --> 05:22.503
YOU MIND IF
I MOVE YOUR PURSE?

05:22.570 --> 05:23.671
OH, YEAH. SORRY.

05:23.738 --> 05:26.774

A LANDSCAPER?

05:29.544 --> 05:31.112

05:34.183 --> 05:35.783
BUT HE HAS
A REAL KNACK FOR IT.

05:35.851 --> 05:38.052
HUH. THAT COULD REALLY
WORK OUT WELL FOR ME.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.088
WE NEED A LITTLE WORK
DONE ON OUR FRONT YARD.

05:40.156 --> 05:43.524
BUT I ONLY
WANNA SPEND $500.

05:43.592 --> 05:45.326
GIVE HIM A CALL.
TAKE A FLIER.

05:45.393 --> 05:47.594
GREAT. THANKS.

05:49.081 --> 05:51.449

IT'S A STEAK-EYE VIEW.

06:30.038 --> 06:32.473
LOOK AT THIS. WE'RE
ZOOMING INTO THE DRIP TRAY

06:32.541 --> 06:34.608

06:34.676 --> 06:37.545
DRIP TRAY,
LAVA ROCKS.

06:37.612 --> 06:39.747
FEELS SEXY,

06:39.814 --> 06:42.150
WOULD YOU JUST PICK ONE

06:42.217 --> 06:43.584
AND JUST BUY IT?

06:44.920 --> 06:47.355
HELLO?

06:58.049 --> 06:59.517
NO, HE'S OUT NOW.

06:59.584 --> 07:01.719
OH, OK. CAN YOU SEE THAT HE GETS THIS?

07:01.786 --> 07:03.187
A SLIM-JIM?

07:03.255 --> 07:05.523
YEAH. YEAH, HE BROUGHT
ONE ON OUR WALK TODAY,

07:05.591 --> 07:07.191
AND A COUPLE OF THE DOGS TAG-TEAMED HIM

07:07.259 --> 07:08.926
AND TOOK IT AWAY.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.129
YOU MADE A SPECIAL TRIP
FOR THIS?

07:12.197 --> 07:14.415
HE WAS
PRETTY INSISTENT.

07:14.482 --> 07:16.316
OK, I'LL

07:22.157 --> 07:24.658
WHAT A GREAT JOB DANNY
DID ON HIS FRONT YARD.

07:24.726 --> 07:26.928
I GUESS SOMEBODY
WAS WRONG ABOUT HIM.

07:26.995 --> 07:29.163
OK, MY IDIOT COUSIN
CAN DIG A DITCH.

07:29.230 --> 07:31.832
OH, HOW

07:32.801 --> 07:34.686
DID YOU JUST

07:38.524 --> 07:40.024
YEAH.

07:40.092 --> 07:41.993
GOSH, I HEAR

07:42.060 --> 07:43.828
I MEAN, IS THERE ANY

07:43.896 --> 07:46.831
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR GUY?

07:46.899 --> 07:49.433
DR. AMBROSE? WELL, I SAW
HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES,

07:49.502 --> 07:53.137
AND THEN HE KEPT
CALLING ME LATE AT NIGHT.

07:54.272 --> 07:55.305
I MEAN, IS THERE
ANY WAY YOU COULD

07:55.373 --> 07:57.341
PUT IN A GOOD WORD
FOR ME WITH CRAWFORD?

07:57.409 --> 07:59.243
UH-HUH. UH-HUH. UM.

07:59.311 --> 08:00.812
NO. NO.

08:00.879 --> 08:01.963
WELL-
I CAN'T.

08:02.031 --> 08:03.047
IF YOU JUST-
I DON'T WANT TO.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.215
IT WON'T
TAKE 2 SECONDS.

08:04.282 --> 08:05.216
I JUST
DON'T WANT TO.

08:05.283 --> 08:06.317
OK, THANK YOU.
OK. ALL RIGHT.

08:06.385 --> 08:07.652
THANKS VERY MUCH.

08:20.865 --> 08:21.799
OH, YEAH! I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE WITH HIM.

08:21.866 --> 08:22.800
HE'S THRILLED.

08:22.867 --> 08:23.801
I KNOW.

08:23.868 --> 08:24.968
AND AS A TOKEN
OF MY APPRECIATION,

08:25.036 --> 08:27.572
I BOUGHT YOU
A PRUNUS PERSICA.

08:27.639 --> 08:31.008
OR, AS YOU KIDS CALL IT, AN APPLE TREE.

08:31.076 --> 08:32.844
SWEET. YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE TOO MANY APPLES.

08:32.912 --> 08:36.347
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE BURIED
IN THEM IN ABOUT 18 YEARS.

08:36.414 --> 08:38.115

08:53.849 --> 08:56.050
NO, THAT'S ME WITH A
REALLY BIG GREEN THUMB.

09:01.256 --> 09:04.358

09:04.426 --> 09:05.726
YEAH? SO?

09:05.794 --> 09:07.845

THE JOB RAN OVER.
IT HAPPENS.

09:09.965 --> 09:12.199
OK. HE'S GONNA FREAK
OUT WHEN HE SEES THIS.

09:12.267 --> 09:13.917
HE CAN FREAK OUT
ALL HE WANTS.

09:13.985 --> 09:18.222
HE GOT HIS HEDGES.
NOW I GETS MY CABBAGE.

09:18.289 --> 09:20.524
YEAH, AND HE
DROPS ME AS A PATIENT

09:20.592 --> 09:21.692
'CAUSE HE'S GONNA
BLAME ME FOR THIS.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.794
OH, COME ON.
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

09:23.862 --> 09:25.713
YOU DON'T
CROSS THIS GUY, OK?

09:25.780 --> 09:27.515
SORRY, PAL. YOU'RE
ONLY CHARGING HIM $500.

09:27.583 --> 09:28.549
I CAN'T DO THAT.

09:28.617 --> 09:29.417
YOU'RE DOING IT.

09:29.484 --> 09:31.002
I CAN'T! I
ALREADY OWE IT ALL!

09:31.069 --> 09:33.404
I GOT ALL THESE PLANTS ON
CREDIT FROM THE NURSERY.

09:33.472 --> 09:34.255
I GOTTA PAY MY WORKERS.

09:34.322 --> 09:36.174
THIS THING ALONE
WAS $63.

09:36.241 --> 09:37.976
YOU CHARGED HIM
FOR MY APPLE TREE?!

09:38.043 --> 09:41.262
IT'S HOW
THE BUSINESS WORKS!

09:41.330 --> 09:42.963
YOU'RE A MORON!

09:43.031 --> 09:44.699
DON'T LET ME
BOTHER YOU, KIDS.

09:44.767 --> 09:46.801
JUST MEASURING OUT
A NEW SPOT FOR MY GRILL.

09:46.869 --> 09:48.853
SORRY, CARRIE. THE BILL
IS WHAT IT IS, ALL RIGHT?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.938
I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR
CHARITY. I'M A BUSINESSMAN.

09:51.006 --> 09:52.773
WELL, FINE. I'M JUST GONNA CALL
HIM AND TELL HIM NOT TO PAY YOU.

09:52.841 --> 09:54.108
WELL, THEN,
I'LL SUE HIM.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.409
OR, BETTER YET,
I'LL GO TO HIS HOUSE

09:55.476 --> 09:56.677
AND RIP OUT
ALL MY PLANTS.

09:56.745 --> 09:57.678
PARDON ME.

09:57.746 --> 09:59.013
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

09:59.081 --> 10:00.281
YEAH, WELL,
BELIEVE IT, BABY.

10:01.850 --> 10:05.036
I'M GONNA LOSE
MY GYNECOLOGIST.

10:05.103 --> 10:07.338
HOLLY'S GUY
SOUNDED PRETTY GOOD.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.716
HEY, HON.

10:18.783 --> 10:20.351
WATCHING A WESTERN?

10:20.419 --> 10:22.186
YEAH.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.338
WHO MADE
SALOON FURNITURE?

10:24.406 --> 10:28.175
NEVER REALLY HELD UP
DURING A FIGHT.

10:28.243 --> 10:29.443
AND THOSE BANISTERS,

10:29.511 --> 10:31.345
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF EVEN HAVING ONE?

10:32.798 --> 10:35.199
HA HA!

10:35.266 --> 10:38.135
THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU. I NEVER
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

10:41.406 --> 10:43.841
OKAY,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:46.578 --> 10:47.278
HERE'S THE THING.

10:47.346 --> 10:49.296
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU HEARD

10:49.364 --> 10:50.832
WHAT WENT DOWN
WITH DANNY AND I,

10:50.899 --> 10:53.568
BUT IT TURNS OUT HE'S GONNA
OVERCHARGE MY GYNECOLOGIST

10:53.635 --> 10:55.269
BY, LIKE, $400.

10:55.337 --> 10:56.637
YEAH?

10:56.704 --> 10:58.455
OK, NOW, I'M JUST THROWING
THIS OUT THERE, OK?

10:58.523 --> 11:02.493
I'M JUST SPITBALLING. I WANT YOU
TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND, ALL RIGHT?

11:02.561 --> 11:05.113
I WANT US TO PAY
THE EXTRA $400.

11:10.903 --> 11:12.486
OK, COOL.
ALL RIGHT.

11:12.553 --> 11:13.788
SO I'M JUST GONNA
GO SCOOT ON DOWN

11:13.855 --> 11:15.005
TO THE ATM,
ALL RIGHT?

11:15.073 --> 11:16.891
AND I'LL SEE YOU
IN A MINUTE.

11:16.958 --> 11:19.994
SALOON FURNITURE.
YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN!

11:20.061 --> 11:20.761
HEY! HEY!

11:20.829 --> 11:22.013
YOU DON'T GOTTA
GO TO THE ATM,

11:22.080 --> 11:23.514
I GOT IT RIGHT HERE.
I GOT IT RIGHT HERE.

11:23.582 --> 11:24.782
NOT A PROBLEM.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.186
HERE IT IS,
100, 200, 300,

11:28.253 --> 11:30.188
NO HUNDRED EVER.

11:31.373 --> 11:33.691
COME ON, DOUG!

11:33.759 --> 11:35.292
NO, IT'S INSANE. I'M NOT
PAYING FOR DANNY'S SCREWUP.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.577
LET DANNY PAY FOR IT.

11:36.645 --> 11:37.978
HE CAN'T PAY FOR IT.
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY.

11:38.046 --> 11:39.380
BESIDES,
HE'S A LOOSE CANNON.

11:39.447 --> 11:42.316
HE COULD FREAK OUT AND LEAVE
A DEAD SHRUB IN THE GUY'S BED.

11:42.384 --> 11:44.835
LET ME JUST GET
THE 500 FROM CRAWFORD,

11:44.903 --> 11:46.403
PUT IT
IN WITH OUR MONEY,

11:46.471 --> 11:47.872
AND I'LL GIVE IT
ALL TO DANNY.

11:47.939 --> 11:50.574
NOBODY HAS TO KNOW ANYTHING,
AND EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

11:50.642 --> 11:52.743
EXCEPT FOR CHUBBY.

11:53.929 --> 11:56.880
DOUG... PLEASE.

11:56.949 --> 12:00.651
I CANNOT LOSE
THIS GYNECOLOGIST.

12:00.718 --> 12:02.303
WHAT IS IT
ABOUT THIS GUY?

12:02.371 --> 12:05.739
WHAT-WHAT GOES ON
IN THAT ROOM?

12:06.608 --> 12:08.893
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S EVERYTHING.

12:08.961 --> 12:11.629
I MEAN, EVEN THE
LIGHTING IN THERE, DOUG.

12:11.696 --> 12:13.998
I STAYED AFTER
TO REDO MY MAKEUP,

12:14.066 --> 12:17.635
AND IT CAME OUT PERFECT.

12:17.702 --> 12:21.873
WELL, MAYBE LOSING YOUR GYNECOLOGIST
IS A GOOD LESSON FOR YOU.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.776
MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU WANNA
DO SOMETHING NICE FOR DANNY,

12:24.843 --> 12:28.012
YOU'LL THINK TO YOURSELF,
"OOH. LAST TIME I DID THIS,

12:28.080 --> 12:31.482
I LOST MY GYNECOLOGIST."

12:31.549 --> 12:34.452
LOOK, I KNOW IN A LOGICAL
WORLD, IT MAKES NO SENSE,

12:34.519 --> 12:36.787
BUT I THINK IF YOU WERE A
WOMAN, YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

12:36.855 --> 12:38.522
EVEN IF WE DO
PAY THE 400 BUCKS,

12:38.589 --> 12:40.825
THAT'S ALL THE EXTRA MONEY
WE GOT LYING AROUND, YOU KNOW?

12:40.892 --> 12:42.592
HOW AM I GONNA
PAY FOR MY GRILL?

12:42.660 --> 12:43.995
YEAH.

12:44.062 --> 12:46.430
OH... MY GOD.

12:46.498 --> 12:48.732
COME ON. WE'LL JUST
CANCEL THE NEW ONE,

12:48.800 --> 12:50.067
AND I'LL
LIGHT THE OLD ONE.

12:50.135 --> 12:52.102
YOU NEVER
HAVE TO TOUCH IT.

12:52.170 --> 12:53.654
GREAT, SO I'LL STILL
HAVE MY CRAPPY OLD GRILL

12:53.721 --> 12:57.475
AND A WIFE
WITH A SMOKING HEAD.

12:58.677 --> 13:00.578
SORRY, TOOTS.
AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

13:03.965 --> 13:08.368
HEY. UH, I GOTTA TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THIS DANNY/ GYNECOLOGIST THING.

13:08.436 --> 13:09.870
HEY, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
THAT? CARRIE WANTS US

13:09.938 --> 13:12.573
TO PAY $400 TO DANNY,
MAN. FREAKIN' CRAZY.

13:12.641 --> 13:14.007
YEAH, CRAZY.

13:14.075 --> 13:16.326
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO PAY THAT.

13:16.394 --> 13:18.762
WHAT? WHY
SHOULD I PAY IT?

13:18.830 --> 13:19.580
BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN
WAS REFERRED

13:19.648 --> 13:21.065
TO DR. CRAWFORD
BY YOUR WIFE,

13:21.133 --> 13:22.499
WHO WAS REFERRED
BY MY WIFE,

13:22.567 --> 13:23.801
AND NOW
MY WIFE'S HYSTERICAL

13:23.869 --> 13:24.969
THAT IF THIS THING
BLOWS UP,

13:25.037 --> 13:26.503
SHE'S GOING DOWN
WITH CARRIE.

13:26.571 --> 13:29.707
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

13:29.774 --> 13:31.659
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS I JUST
GOT BACK TOGETHER WITH KELLY.

13:31.727 --> 13:32.760
I DON'T NEED HER
RUNNING AROUND

13:32.828 --> 13:34.962
CRYING ABOUT LOSING
HER GYNECOLOGIST.

13:35.030 --> 13:36.430
SORRY, DUDE,
I CAN'T DO IT.

13:36.498 --> 13:38.833
OH, YOU'RE DOING IT.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.184
OH, REALLY?
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME?

13:40.252 --> 13:42.119
MAYBE I WILL.

13:42.187 --> 13:44.321
ALL RIGHT,
THEN LET'S GO.

13:44.389 --> 13:45.472
OW!

13:47.359 --> 13:48.942
YOU SAID LET'S GO!

13:49.010 --> 13:51.195
DID NOT EXPECT THAT!

13:51.263 --> 13:52.879
I'M SORRY, MAN.

13:52.947 --> 13:55.683
LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT
MY MARRIAGE BACK TOGETHER HERE.

13:55.750 --> 13:56.883
FINE!
I'LL DO IT.

13:56.951 --> 13:58.552
THANK YOU.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.220
WHAT IS IT
WITH THIS DOCTOR?

14:00.288 --> 14:01.888
WHAT DO THEY LOVE
SO MUCH ABOUT HIM?

14:01.956 --> 14:04.024
I DON'T KNOW.
HE-HE'S SOOTHING.

14:04.091 --> 14:06.159
HE PUTS THEM AT EASE.

14:08.162 --> 14:10.431
HE'S LIKE
THE VAGINA WHISPERER.

14:23.728 --> 14:25.462
HEY.

14:27.065 --> 14:28.999
HOW'S IT GOING?

14:31.069 --> 14:34.404
DON'T WORRY. NOBODY'S
TRYING TO LIGHT YOU.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.942
JUST GONNA
CHECK OUT YOUR GAS FLOW.

14:40.679 --> 14:43.814
SO... HOW ABOUT
THEM KNICKS, HUH?

14:45.951 --> 14:47.151
I TELL YOU,
I THINK THIS YEAR

14:47.219 --> 14:49.220
THEY'RE LOOKING
PRETTY GOOD IF THEY-

14:54.259 --> 14:56.193
I WILL SEE YOU
IN HELL.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.564
HI, HONEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:00.632 --> 15:02.833
OH, JUST TRYING TO
COOK DINNER AND NOT DIE.

15:02.901 --> 15:04.835
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU HATE THIS GRILL,

15:04.903 --> 15:07.071
BUT EVERYTHING
WORKED OUT GREAT.

15:07.139 --> 15:09.106
DANNY THINKS DR. CRAWFORD
PAID FOR THE WHOLE THING.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.242
DR. CRAWFORD THINKS
HE ONLY PAID $500.

15:11.309 --> 15:13.911
IT'S OVER. AND
I PROMISE YOU NEXT YEAR,

15:13.979 --> 15:15.980
I WILL BUY YOU
AN EVEN BETTER GRILL.

15:16.047 --> 15:17.264
STOP SAYING GRILL.

15:17.332 --> 15:20.200
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GO
COOK THIS MEAT INSIDE, OK?

15:22.237 --> 15:24.372
AAH!

15:29.344 --> 15:31.144
HONEY, THERE'S A MESSAGE
ON THE MACHINE.

15:31.212 --> 15:32.613
DID YOU CHECK IT?
NO!

15:34.749 --> 15:35.949
GREETINGS, AMERICANS,

15:36.017 --> 15:38.752
AND WELCOME
TO TODAY'S MORON REPORT.

15:38.820 --> 15:41.121
SEEMS DR. CRAWFORD
WAS SO HAPPY WITH THE JOB

15:41.189 --> 15:43.624
THIS MORON DID
IN HIS FRONT YARD

15:43.692 --> 15:47.094
THAT HE JUST HIRED HIM
TO DO HIS WHOLE BACKYARD.

15:48.263 --> 15:50.097
HUH! GUESS HE DIDN'T
HAVE ANY PROBLEM

15:50.164 --> 15:51.965
WITH THE $900 AFTER ALL.

15:52.033 --> 15:54.968
OOH! FILE THIS
UNDER "BURNED."

15:56.938 --> 15:59.457
OW! WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

15:59.524 --> 16:00.891
YOU'RE GONNA CALL
DR. CRAWFORD.

16:00.959 --> 16:03.294
YOU'RE GONNA TELL HIM YOU'RE
SICK, TELL HIM YOU DIED,

16:03.362 --> 16:06.063
TELL HIM YOU SLICED OFF YOUR
FOOT WITH A GARDEN WEASEL.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.631
JUST GET OUT OF IT.

16:07.699 --> 16:09.550
WHY SHOULD I GET OUT
OF IT? THE GUY LOVES ME.

16:09.617 --> 16:11.785
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
HAPPIER WITH THE JOB I DID.

16:11.852 --> 16:15.088
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
IT COST $500.

16:15.156 --> 16:17.407
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? HE PAID ME 900.

16:17.475 --> 16:18.659
NO, HE PAID YOU 500,

16:18.727 --> 16:21.161
AND DOUG AND I PAID THE
REST OUT OF OUR POCKETS.

16:21.229 --> 16:22.946
YOU DID?
YEAH.

16:23.014 --> 16:26.249
SO CRAWFORD THOUGHT I DID
ALL THAT WORK FOR JUST 500?

16:26.317 --> 16:28.585
AGAIN, YEAH.

16:28.653 --> 16:30.387
UH-OH.

16:30.455 --> 16:33.123
UH-OH? UH-OH WHAT?

16:33.191 --> 16:36.593
W
- WELL, I THOUGHT HE WAS FINE PAYING DOUBLE THE ESTIMATE,

16:36.661 --> 16:38.929
SO I THOUGHT
I'D GIVE TRIPLE A SHOT.

16:38.997 --> 16:42.599
OH, MY GOD! YOU ARE THE
STUPIDEST PERSON ALIVE!

16:42.667 --> 16:44.234
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU GUYS WOULD BE WILLING

16:44.302 --> 16:45.869
TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE
ONE MORE TIME, WOULD YOU?

16:45.937 --> 16:48.505
OW! SAME ONE!

16:48.573 --> 16:51.608
WOULD YOU PLEASE GET YOUR
GOLDFISH OUT OF MY BATHTUB?

16:51.676 --> 16:53.077
ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE
NOT GOLDFISH, OK?

16:53.144 --> 16:54.377
THEY'RE JAPANESE KOl,

16:54.445 --> 16:56.446
AND THEY'RE REALLY
EXPENSIVE, SO HANDS OFF.

16:56.514 --> 16:59.282
WHOA, WHOA. ARE THOSE
KOl FOR DR. CRAWFORD?

16:59.350 --> 17:01.418
YEAH.
DID HE ASK FOR KOl?

17:01.485 --> 17:03.453
NOT IN SO MANY WORDS.

17:03.521 --> 17:05.256
IT'S ONE WORD!

17:05.323 --> 17:06.723
ABOUT MY BATH?

17:06.790 --> 17:08.592
IS THIS THE WAY
YOU TAKE A BATH?

17:08.659 --> 17:09.792
YEAH.

17:09.861 --> 17:12.628
<i>YOU LOOK LIKE ERNIE FROM SESAME STREET.</i>

17:12.696 --> 17:13.864
WHAT DID I
DO TO YOU?

17:13.932 --> 17:15.665
I DON'T
- NOTHING. I'M SORRY.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.501
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

17:17.568 --> 17:19.303
I- I CAN'T RUN
A BUSINESS.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.672
OH, MAN! WHY DID I LISTEN
TO THAT FORTUNE COOKIE?!

17:22.740 --> 17:23.940
I HATE ME!

17:24.008 --> 17:25.642
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER HERE.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.743
CALL DR. CRAWFORD.
I WILL DIAL.

17:27.811 --> 17:28.779
ALL RIGHT, BUT I'LL
TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.

17:28.846 --> 17:30.314
HE'S GONNA
BE PRETTY PISSED.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.382
I ALREADY
DUG UP HIS YARD

17:31.449 --> 17:33.450
AND I MAY HAVE CUT
HIS PHONE LINE.

17:34.852 --> 17:38.122
OK, DANNY. I GUESS YOU HAVE
TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

17:38.189 --> 17:40.824
BUT HERE'S HOW
IT'S GONNA GO DOWN.

17:40.892 --> 17:42.459
LOOK AT ME.
I CAN'T.

17:42.527 --> 17:44.962
LOOK AT ME!

17:45.030 --> 17:46.397
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE HIM

17:46.464 --> 17:48.432
EXACTLY WHAT HE ASKED FOR

17:48.499 --> 17:51.902
FOR EXACTLY THE AMOUNT YOU
TOLD HIM IT WAS GONNA COST,

17:51.970 --> 17:55.039
AND IT'S GONNA BE
FRIGGIN' GORGEOUS,

17:55.106 --> 17:58.475
OR I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM.

18:06.918 --> 18:07.818
YEAH.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.386
IT WAS FUNNY.

18:09.454 --> 18:10.454
HEY, NICE JOB
UP THERE

18:10.521 --> 18:12.056
WITH THE KARAOKE,
MY FRIEND.

18:12.123 --> 18:15.059
OH, THANKS, MAN. AND I
WASN'T JUST TALKING SMACK.

18:15.126 --> 18:17.061
YOU DO HAVE
BETTE DAVIS EYES.

18:21.299 --> 18:23.800
CARRIE, THIS IS
DR. CRAWFORD.

18:23.868 --> 18:26.837
SORRY ABOUT THE CONNECTION.
I'M ON MY CELL.

18:26.904 --> 18:29.473
SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH MY HOME PHONE.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.841
ANYWAY,
I'M JUST CALLING

18:30.908 --> 18:32.709
BECAUSE DANNY

18:32.777 --> 18:35.145
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO GET A HOLD OF HIM SINCE.

18:35.213 --> 18:37.547
I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN
TONIGHT UNTIL MONDAY,

18:37.615 --> 18:41.218
BUT IF YOU SPEAK TO HIM,
PLEASE LEAVE ME A MESSAGE.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.855
THANKS. BYE!

18:44.922 --> 18:47.157
YOU LET YOUR COUSIN
DO ANOTHER JOB FOR HIM?

18:47.225 --> 18:49.175
I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL
AFTER HE STARTED IT.

18:49.243 --> 18:50.260
WELL, WHERE IS HE?

19:05.426 --> 19:09.262
OK. IT'S 1 A.M. I'M STANDING
IN YOUR GYNECOLOGIST'S BACKYARD

19:09.330 --> 19:12.299
PLANTING A PEAR TREE.

19:12.366 --> 19:14.167
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND AFTER THIS,

19:14.235 --> 19:16.503
WE HAVE A WHOLE ROW OF
MORNING GLORIES TO PLANT,

19:16.571 --> 19:17.738
SO KEEP IT MOVING.

19:17.806 --> 19:19.673
WHY THE HELL AM I PUSHING
THE DAMN WHEELBARROW?

19:19.741 --> 19:20.741
HE'S YOUR DOCTOR!

19:20.809 --> 19:22.709
JUST KEEP IT DOWN.
HOW'S IT GOING?

19:22.777 --> 19:24.511
NOT GOOD. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M LOOKING AT HERE.

19:24.579 --> 19:25.612
I THINK
I'M GONNA CRY.

19:27.381 --> 19:28.549
DEACON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:28.616 --> 19:29.616
RELAX.
THE GUY'S OUT OF TOWN.

19:29.684 --> 19:31.051
I JUST WANT
TO CHECK OUT HIS PLACE.

19:31.118 --> 19:33.404
WHAT'S HE GOT
GOING ON IN THERE?

19:33.471 --> 19:36.073
OH, MY GOD! HE'S
GOT VAGINAS IN JARS!

19:38.709 --> 19:41.145
I THINK
THOSE ARE PEACHES.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.617
OH.

19:47.685 --> 19:49.353
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

19:49.421 --> 19:51.304
CAN YOU GUYS GET
BACK TO WORK, PLEASE?

19:51.372 --> 19:52.822
AW, MAN.

19:52.891 --> 19:55.359
I NEVER FELT LIKE
LESS OF A MAN IN MY LIFE.

19:57.295 --> 19:59.696
OH, THIS IS
JUST A JOKE!

19:59.764 --> 20:02.032
TURN IT OFF!

20:02.100 --> 20:04.535
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
- IT'S PROBABLY ON A TIMER!

20:04.603 --> 20:06.470
YOU GUYS, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT. JUST KEEP DIGGING.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.105
WHAT?! WHAT? IT'S JUST WATER!

20:08.172 --> 20:09.623
WHAT ARE YOU,
A BIG BABY?

20:09.691 --> 20:12.225
OH, MY GOD,
LOOK AT THIS!

20:12.293 --> 20:15.562
HE'S GOT THE CHARMASTER
8000! HE'S GOT MY GRILL!

20:18.232 --> 20:21.835
WITH A PATRIOTS LOGO!
THAT IS SO WRONG!

20:28.159 --> 20:29.660
AND THAT'S IT.

20:29.727 --> 20:31.662
WE ARE DONE HERE.

20:31.729 --> 20:33.463
REALLY?

20:33.531 --> 20:37.501
WOW. THAT WAS DELIGHTFUL.

20:37.568 --> 20:39.153
SUPER.

20:39.220 --> 20:41.171
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW HAPPY I AM

20:41.239 --> 20:43.173
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO DR. AMBROSE ANYMORE.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.908
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR FITTING ME IN.

20:44.976 --> 20:47.394
WELL, NORMALLY YOU'D HAVE
TO WAIT AT LEAST A YEAR,

20:47.462 --> 20:50.264
BUT YOU CALLED
ON THE RIGHT DAY.

20:50.331 --> 20:52.866
I CAME HOME EARLY FROM
MY VACATION LAST NIGHT

20:52.934 --> 20:55.002
AND FOUND
2 OF MY PATIENTS

20:55.070 --> 20:57.504
SOAKING WET, STANDING
IN A HOLE IN MY BACKYARD

20:57.572 --> 21:01.241
SLAPPING EACH OTHER.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

21:01.309 --> 21:04.261
THERE ARE A LOT OF
SICK PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD.

21:15.439 --> 21:16.640
HELLO?

21:16.708 --> 21:18.108
HELLO, CARRIE?

21:18.175 --> 21:21.144
THIS IS DR. AMBROSE.

21:21.212 --> 21:23.413
OH, HI.

21:23.481 --> 21:25.181
WHAT'S UP?

21:26.305 --> 21:32.201
