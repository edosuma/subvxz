00:00.200 --> 00:01.399
Previously on "Heartland":

00:05.837 --> 00:08.606
Hey, you're okay.
You're okay.

00:08.674 --> 00:09.706
Amy Fleming.

00:09.774 --> 00:11.141
Stewart Forrest, Caesar's trainer.

00:11.208 --> 00:12.342
<i>He's an Olympic hopeful.</i>

00:12.410 --> 00:13.443
I mean, I don't know how you did that,

00:13.511 --> 00:15.178
but... thank you.

00:16.113 --> 00:17.514
You are not gonna believe this.

00:19.684 --> 00:21.151
Miracle girl?

00:21.218 --> 00:22.486
Fine. But you know I need you
to get back to me

00:22.553 --> 00:23.620
like yesterday.

00:25.822 --> 00:27.690
Trouble in Dubai?

00:27.758 --> 00:29.659
I'm having some cash flow issues.

00:29.726 --> 00:31.160
When chase said you couldn't
come to the movie,

00:31.227 --> 00:34.129
I should've just gone home.

00:34.197 --> 00:35.298
What movie?

00:35.365 --> 00:36.766
When you were studying, last night?

00:36.833 --> 00:38.033
I never meant...

00:38.101 --> 00:39.168
I didn't know that...

00:39.235 --> 00:40.636
Soraya.

00:40.704 --> 00:41.836
Chase.

00:41.904 --> 00:42.837
What?

00:42.905 --> 00:44.673
We can't do this.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.873
Do what?

00:45.941 --> 00:47.742
You're dating my best friend.

00:47.810 --> 00:48.876
And if I wasn't?

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

01:23.711 --> 01:26.346
Well, look at that!

01:26.413 --> 01:29.148
You're famous.

01:29.216 --> 01:31.249
And a real nice picture too,

01:31.317 --> 01:33.184
don't you think?

01:33.252 --> 01:34.853
Oh, wow!

01:34.920 --> 01:36.087
That's pretty cool.

01:36.155 --> 01:37.956
Thanks.

01:38.023 --> 01:39.624
Off to school.
See you, guys.

01:39.692 --> 01:40.892
See ya.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.695
I am so proud of you.
You know that?

01:43.763 --> 01:45.330
Thank you.

01:45.997 --> 01:48.198
So, now, what are you doing
cleaning out Copper's stall?

01:48.266 --> 01:51.168
Well, Mallory sure isn't
showing up to do it.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.603
She hasn't called or anything?

01:52.671 --> 01:55.939
No. And I'm the one ends up
looking after her horse.

01:56.007 --> 01:59.577
You're, you're not too famous
to help me out, are you?

01:59.644 --> 02:01.111
Uh... no.

02:02.045 --> 02:03.045
Good.

02:03.113 --> 02:04.514
'Cause I wanna show this to Lou.

02:06.183 --> 02:08.485
Well, Stewart Forrest!
Good to see you.

02:08.551 --> 02:10.453
Hey! Stewart!

02:10.520 --> 02:11.788
Have you seen this?

02:11.856 --> 02:13.723
My Amy right there on the cover

02:13.791 --> 02:16.058
of <i>Western Financial Group</i> magazine.

02:16.126 --> 02:17.459
I did see it, yes.

02:17.527 --> 02:19.294
That's kind of why I'm here.

02:19.362 --> 02:20.962
It's been a while, miracle girl.

02:21.030 --> 02:22.598
- How have you been?
- Great!

02:22.665 --> 02:24.566
Good, 'cause I have a job for you.

02:24.634 --> 02:26.968
I need your help
with training someone.

02:27.036 --> 02:29.671
How could I possibly help you
with horse training?

02:29.739 --> 02:30.873
Oh, I think you can.

02:30.940 --> 02:32.007
You busy right now?

02:32.074 --> 02:34.241
Um...

02:34.309 --> 02:35.777
No.

02:35.844 --> 02:37.612
Then why don't you
come over to my barn

02:37.679 --> 02:39.346
and I'll show you.

02:39.415 --> 02:40.748
No-no, they can't!

02:40.816 --> 02:43.150
They can't do that.
We have it in writing.

02:44.620 --> 02:45.620
I thought we had people
representing us over there?

02:45.687 --> 02:46.921
Do we not?

02:46.988 --> 02:50.290
Are we not paying people
to represent us there?!

02:50.357 --> 02:52.158
What? No.
Are you crazy?

02:52.226 --> 02:53.393
I can't turn around

02:53.461 --> 02:54.628
and get on a plane back to Dubai.

02:54.695 --> 02:55.762
What am I gonna tell my wife?

02:57.899 --> 03:00.567
I gotta call you back.

03:00.635 --> 03:02.436
I will call you back.
Yes.

03:03.370 --> 03:05.171
What was that about?

03:05.239 --> 03:06.705
It's nothing.
It's Doug.

03:06.773 --> 03:07.973
You know, he doesn't feel
like he's ining his job

03:08.041 --> 03:09.775
unless everyone's having
a heart attack.

03:09.843 --> 03:10.910
You didn't have to end your call.

03:10.977 --> 03:12.344
I just wanted to show you something.

03:12.412 --> 03:15.380
Oh, honey, I'm happy
to get off the phone, honestly.

03:15.449 --> 03:17.516
- What's up?
- Look at this.

03:18.919 --> 03:19.985
Running strollers.

03:20.053 --> 03:21.586
Lightweight graphite composite,

03:21.654 --> 03:23.287
yet sturdy enough for gravel roads.

03:23.355 --> 03:25.490
Wow! it's...

03:25.558 --> 03:27.124
buy a small vehicle for that price.

03:27.192 --> 03:29.226
Yeah, they're a little more than some,

03:29.294 --> 03:31.362
- but you get what you pay for, right?
- Mm-hmm.

03:31.430 --> 03:32.964
I am not going to be
one of those mothers

03:33.031 --> 03:34.532
who carries around pregnancy pounds

03:34.600 --> 03:36.267
the next 15 years.

03:36.335 --> 03:37.935
You wouldn't want that, would you?

03:38.002 --> 03:39.670
Is there a right answer
to that question?

03:39.737 --> 03:41.171
So... the fit
or the summit?

03:42.540 --> 03:44.307
Uh... which one
comes with a motor?

03:44.375 --> 03:46.042
Well, Peter, just help me choose.

03:48.179 --> 03:49.446
Guys, look at this.

03:49.514 --> 03:51.548
Aww! Look at Amy!

03:52.484 --> 03:53.549
I have to head into town;

03:53.617 --> 03:55.250
I need a new pair of wire strippers.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.620
Amy's got my truck.
Can you give me a lift?

03:57.688 --> 03:58.855
I can do that.
No problem.

03:58.922 --> 04:00.990
- Uh... Peter?
- Yeah?

04:01.057 --> 04:02.391
Which stroller?

04:02.459 --> 04:03.526
Oh, honey, they're
ridiculously expensive.

04:03.594 --> 04:05.928
Let's figure something else out, okay?

04:08.064 --> 04:10.899
Two things a father
should not attempt:

04:10.967 --> 04:12.567
Teaching your daughter to drive

04:12.635 --> 04:16.004
and trying to coach her
before a big competition.

04:16.071 --> 04:17.005
Right, Riana?

04:17.072 --> 04:18.238
Right, dad.

04:18.307 --> 04:19.741
He's a really beautiful horse.

04:19.809 --> 04:20.909
Addison.

04:20.976 --> 04:22.477
Had my eye on him for two years

04:22.545 --> 04:25.079
and he finally became available.

04:25.147 --> 04:27.815
Paid too much for him
but he's worth it.

04:27.883 --> 04:31.184
<i>Look, Riana's got qualifiers
in a couple of weeks.</i>

04:31.252 --> 04:32.319
She's enthusiastic,

04:32.387 --> 04:33.621
wants to compete more than anything,

04:33.688 --> 04:37.725
but we never really found
the right horse for her until now.

04:37.792 --> 04:38.993
Wanna take him out for a spin?

04:39.060 --> 04:40.127
Yeah.

04:42.062 --> 04:43.229
Come on.

04:56.176 --> 04:57.709
She seems pretty tentative.

04:57.777 --> 04:59.377
<i>That's why I need your help.</i>

04:59.445 --> 05:01.046
See, Addison's the kind of animal

05:01.113 --> 05:03.148
that can really build the reputation

05:03.215 --> 05:04.850
of a young rider.

05:04.918 --> 05:07.352
He's too flat...
collect him up.

05:08.287 --> 05:10.221
That's a lot of horse for that girl,

05:10.289 --> 05:11.790
and a lot of bit.

05:11.858 --> 05:13.624
It's the only
way she can control him.

05:15.393 --> 05:16.627
Okay, sit back.

05:16.695 --> 05:18.095
<i>Sit back, drive!</i>

05:19.031 --> 05:20.531
<i>Drive!</i>

05:20.599 --> 05:21.966
- Watch... watch...

05:22.034 --> 05:24.068
Go around! Riana!

05:28.440 --> 05:30.239
You okay, honey?

05:31.876 --> 05:32.876
It's okay, I'm fine.

05:32.944 --> 05:34.410
You took a bit of a knock there.

05:34.478 --> 05:36.179
Oh, that was my fault.

05:36.246 --> 05:37.380
Riana,

05:37.448 --> 05:38.582
why don't you just take a break.

05:38.649 --> 05:40.817
Let him catch his breath, walk it out.

05:40.885 --> 05:42.452
Uh, okay.

05:42.519 --> 05:44.754
Honestly, I'm fine.
It was totally my fault.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.462
That is way too much horse
for that girl.

05:53.529 --> 05:55.097
I bought him for her specifically.

05:55.164 --> 05:57.967
She has to learn how to
handle horses like this.

05:58.034 --> 05:59.167
She's just not ready.

05:59.235 --> 06:02.203
I don't think I can help you.

06:02.270 --> 06:04.872
Are you actually turning
this job down?

06:04.940 --> 06:06.207
I guess I am.

06:07.142 --> 06:10.377
Well, that's not very good
for her career...

06:10.445 --> 06:11.512
Or yours.

I've got nothing to say to you, chase.

07:08.033 --> 07:10.901
No one turns down Stewart Forrest.

07:10.969 --> 07:12.069
How did do you hear about that?

07:12.137 --> 07:14.805
I got friends in high places.

07:14.873 --> 07:16.006
I don't wanna talk to you.

07:16.074 --> 07:17.241
Hey, hey,
don't be like that.

07:19.578 --> 07:20.611
We're in the same business;

07:20.679 --> 07:21.779
We can't afford to be strangers.

07:21.846 --> 07:22.912
Do you know how much trouble

07:22.980 --> 07:24.314
you caused me with Soraya?

07:24.382 --> 07:26.616
She'll get over it.
It's fine. Trust me.

07:26.684 --> 07:28.684
- Trust you?! You're kidding, right?
- Amy.

07:29.420 --> 07:33.356
$150,000 dollar horse
and the big man's daughter.

07:33.424 --> 07:34.658
Trainer to the Olympians.

07:34.725 --> 07:36.326
You pull this off,
you'll look like a genius.

07:36.394 --> 07:38.627
Riana's not ready to compete
on that horse.

07:38.695 --> 07:40.062
Not in two weeks, not in four weeks,

07:40.129 --> 07:41.797
maybe not ever.

07:41.864 --> 07:43.299
It's a train wreck waiting to happen.

07:43.366 --> 07:45.100
It would be irresponsible
of me to take it on.

07:47.470 --> 07:48.804
See this?

07:48.871 --> 07:50.639
This kind of attention
can disappear overnight

07:50.707 --> 07:51.940
if word gets out you walked away

07:52.008 --> 07:53.975
from a difficult training situation.

07:54.043 --> 07:56.211
By next issue nobody cares, I promise.

07:56.278 --> 07:57.845
Soraya, hey.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.648
Hi.

08:00.716 --> 08:01.649
Great. Look,
don't worry about her.

08:01.717 --> 08:02.817
I'll deal with it.

08:02.884 --> 08:04.118
You got bigger problems than Soraya.

08:04.186 --> 08:07.788
Call Stewart Forrest back, Amy, okay,

08:07.856 --> 08:09.824
and beg for I'm serious.

08:09.891 --> 08:12.025
It's important if you
wanna stay in the business.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.052
Hi, Stewart.
It's Amy.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.455
Listen, I've changed my mind.

08:43.522 --> 08:47.759
I'd like to see what I can do
to help Riana.

08:47.826 --> 08:49.661
Okay. Great.

08:49.729 --> 08:50.962
I'd rather work with her at Heartland,

08:51.029 --> 08:52.529
if you don't mind.

08:53.465 --> 08:56.967
Okay. I'm sorry about
all the back and forth.

08:57.034 --> 08:58.435
Okay. Bye.

09:11.348 --> 09:13.383
I don't get it.

09:13.450 --> 09:15.251
There's no jumps.

09:16.186 --> 09:18.321
Well, you just seemed
a little tense on Addison,

09:18.390 --> 09:20.990
so I want you to dress up first
just get you moving together

09:21.057 --> 09:22.392
and feeling comfortable
with one another...

09:22.459 --> 09:24.326
without the distraction of the jumps.

09:24.394 --> 09:26.461
You mean just like flat work?

09:26.529 --> 09:29.298
Well, I mean getting to know
his movements,

09:29.365 --> 09:32.000
just become familiar with him.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.403
You know, a horse has to want
to perform for you,

09:34.470 --> 09:36.137
but he's gotta trust you first.

09:36.205 --> 09:39.407
Look, I have two weeks
to get ready for a show.

09:39.474 --> 09:42.176
Dad expects me to be working
on my combinations.

09:42.243 --> 09:45.479
Can we just try it my way first?

10:21.047 --> 10:22.280
Hey, Riana?

10:22.349 --> 10:23.482
Why don't you come in for a minute?

10:25.752 --> 10:28.319
I think I'm gonna change out your bit.

10:28.387 --> 10:29.487
Why?

10:29.555 --> 10:30.822
This is just a little severe for him.

10:30.889 --> 10:33.023
He's fighting it and
making it tougher for you.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.494
Dad says I need this bit
or I won't be able to control him.

10:36.562 --> 10:38.730
Well, there's different ways
of controlling a horse.

10:40.999 --> 10:42.900
I'm not comfortable
switching out the bit.

10:42.968 --> 10:44.200
Dad says it's what I need.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.469
That bit is useful

10:45.536 --> 10:46.670
in the hands of
an experienced rider, but...

10:46.738 --> 10:49.473
I am an experienced rider.

11:02.819 --> 11:04.086
Yeah.

11:04.153 --> 11:05.421
Well, call me right after then.

11:05.489 --> 11:06.722
Listen, Jennifer,

11:06.790 --> 11:07.523
you gotta keep me in the loop here.

11:07.591 --> 11:08.824
Hey, you want coffee?

11:08.892 --> 11:10.593
No thanks.

11:10.660 --> 11:12.094
Yeah, no, I understand that.

11:12.161 --> 11:14.062
<i>Seriously, Jennifer,
you have to let me know.</i>

11:17.433 --> 11:18.900
Hello, Mallory.

11:18.967 --> 11:20.101
Coffee, please.

11:20.168 --> 11:21.302
Menu?

11:21.370 --> 11:24.472
Naw. I just come by
for a quick chat.

11:24.540 --> 11:25.673
Great.

11:25.741 --> 11:27.409
I haven't seen you at the ranch.

11:27.476 --> 11:29.444
Well, I have a job, Jack.
I've been working.

11:29.512 --> 11:31.145
I can see that.

11:31.213 --> 11:33.447
But Copper isn't getting
the attention he deserves

11:33.515 --> 11:35.181
and that's not fair.

11:35.249 --> 11:37.651
Well, I don't have time
to go out there everyday.

11:37.719 --> 11:39.386
Well, Amy and I sure
don't have the time

11:39.454 --> 11:40.721
to look after your horse.

11:40.789 --> 11:43.356
Well, Amy has time
to teach some girl to jump,

11:43.425 --> 11:44.625
doesn't she?

11:44.692 --> 11:46.192
After she's been
promising me for what?...

11:46.260 --> 11:47.394
three years now?

11:47.461 --> 11:50.362
What's that got to do with you
taking care of your horse?

11:50.431 --> 11:53.766
Okay, I don't work at
heartland anymore, remember?

11:53.834 --> 11:55.568
You can't boss me around.

11:55.636 --> 11:57.503
No. No, you're right.

11:57.571 --> 12:00.440
But if you don't start
looking after Copper,

12:00.507 --> 12:03.142
then I get to start
charging you for his keep.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.655
So, how's school going?

12:16.722 --> 12:18.022
Well, I'm a little
behind the eight ball

12:18.090 --> 12:20.390
<i>because of the classes I missed,</i>
<i>but I'm getting there.</i>

12:20.459 --> 12:21.459
I got a big test tomorrow,

12:21.526 --> 12:22.960
so it's gonna be a late night.

12:23.027 --> 12:27.030
No chance I could get you
for a couple hours tomorrow?

12:27.098 --> 12:29.199
Sorry, Jack, I got school.

12:29.267 --> 12:31.134
That big wind last week
knocked a couple of trees down

12:31.202 --> 12:33.136
at your dude ranch.

12:35.073 --> 12:36.138
Sorry.

12:37.074 --> 12:38.441
Um...

12:38.509 --> 12:40.309
Yeah, hey, Jack, I could...

12:40.377 --> 12:41.678
I could help you out with that.

12:41.745 --> 12:43.780
- That's a nice offer.
- Yeah, sure.

12:43.848 --> 12:47.717
So... Amy, how's it going
with Riana and her horse?

12:47.785 --> 12:50.219
Okay.
She's just a little prickly.

12:51.154 --> 12:52.220
Someone told me I'd be crazy

12:52.288 --> 12:54.122
if I turned down Stewart Forrest.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.256
Someone who?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.427
Uh, chase, actually.

13:01.430 --> 13:02.598
You still talk to that guy?

13:02.665 --> 13:04.165
I thought you fired him.

13:04.233 --> 13:05.300
I did.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.406
Well, um...
Thanks for dinner, Lou.

13:12.474 --> 13:15.109
I'm going to get some studying done.

13:16.311 --> 13:17.378
Okay.

13:37.732 --> 13:39.465
Oh, thank you.

13:41.067 --> 13:42.234
So...

13:42.301 --> 13:43.368
How did Peter seem

13:43.436 --> 13:45.470
when you guys went into town today?

13:45.539 --> 13:48.774
Oh, he seemed...
Preoccupied.

13:48.842 --> 13:50.175
What, did he go off

13:50.243 --> 13:52.611
and talk on his phone the whole time?

13:54.548 --> 13:55.347
He did, didn't he?

13:55.415 --> 13:56.915
No, come on, Lou.

13:56.982 --> 13:59.551
He's got a business to run
and it'nonot easy for him.

13:59.618 --> 14:02.887
I know, but there's something
going on, grandpa.

14:02.955 --> 14:04.022
Like what?

14:06.191 --> 14:07.391
I don't know.

14:07.459 --> 14:09.393
But there's something
he's not telling me.

14:09.461 --> 14:12.863
I can feel it in my gut and...

14:12.931 --> 14:14.765
I'm kinda scared actually.

14:14.832 --> 14:16.934
I think he is too.

14:17.001 --> 14:19.002
- Really?
- Well, sure.

14:19.071 --> 14:20.538
Well, the thrill of finding out

14:20.605 --> 14:21.838
you're gonna be a new father

14:21.906 --> 14:24.608
is always followed by the panic

14:24.676 --> 14:26.610
that you're gonna be a new father.

14:28.912 --> 14:31.481
Yeah. Well, I hope
that's all it is.

14:31.549 --> 14:33.883
Well, I'm sure it is.

14:33.951 --> 14:35.017
Okay.

14:38.255 --> 14:39.322
Thanks.

14:45.795 --> 14:47.662
No, no, I get it.
I get it.

14:47.730 --> 14:50.265
Don't worry about it, Jennifer.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.000
I'll try to figure something out.

14:52.068 --> 14:55.137
Okay, I'll let you know.
Bye.

14:55.205 --> 14:56.738
Everything okay?

14:57.673 --> 14:59.408
Yeah. Yeah.

15:01.810 --> 15:03.144
Hey, um...

15:06.948 --> 15:10.184
You know it's okay to be nervous.

15:10.252 --> 15:11.519
About what?

15:11.587 --> 15:14.855
The baby...
being a new father...

15:14.923 --> 15:16.823
No, I'm not.
I'm not nervous.

15:16.890 --> 15:19.192
It's gonna be fine.

15:19.260 --> 15:21.161
I'm nervous.

15:21.229 --> 15:22.462
I'm not exactly Mother Earth

15:22.530 --> 15:25.665
where babies are concerned.

15:26.601 --> 15:28.335
You're gonna be amazing.

15:28.402 --> 15:29.469
Yeah?

15:31.639 --> 15:32.704
Yeah.

15:37.977 --> 15:39.845
There.

15:39.912 --> 15:42.914
See, that's better, isn't it?

15:48.554 --> 15:49.854
Hey, honey, listen.

15:49.921 --> 15:52.190
If I had to go away
for a couple of days, um...

15:52.258 --> 15:54.392
would you be all right with that?

15:56.662 --> 15:58.296
You're talking about Dubai.

15:58.364 --> 15:59.597
You know it's not a couple of days;

15:59.665 --> 16:02.066
It'll turn into weeks.

16:04.102 --> 16:05.636
Forget it.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.304
Just forget it.

16:08.239 --> 16:09.939
Forget it.

16:10.007 --> 16:11.875
You know, I get the whole
cold feet new father thing,

16:11.942 --> 16:13.243
I do, I get it.

16:13.311 --> 16:15.145
But if you just don't wanna
be here anymore,

16:15.213 --> 16:16.880
then I can't stop you.

16:16.947 --> 16:18.282
It's not that I don't wanna be here!

16:18.349 --> 16:19.783
I mean, God knows
you spend all of your time

16:19.850 --> 16:22.051
talking to people there,
you might as well be there.

16:22.118 --> 16:23.919
Oh God.
Come on, Lou...

16:23.987 --> 16:25.954
And okay, you know what?
You've got me thinking...

16:26.022 --> 16:28.724
Maybe there's someone else
you'd rather be with.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.560
What?!
What're you talking about?

16:30.627 --> 16:31.794
Every time I walk into the room

16:31.861 --> 16:33.062
you hang up the phone, Peter.

16:33.129 --> 16:34.963
What am I supposed to think?!

16:35.031 --> 16:36.665
Just forget it, okay?

16:36.732 --> 16:38.500
Forget I said anything, all right?

16:38.568 --> 16:39.634
I'm sorry.

17:01.370 --> 17:03.438
<i>We're closed.</i>

17:03.506 --> 17:05.339
For you.

17:05.407 --> 17:06.473
No.

17:07.976 --> 17:09.511
Okay, the whole movie thing with Amy?

17:09.578 --> 17:11.112
Totally a bad idea.
I get it.

17:11.180 --> 17:13.547
But honestly
it was completely innocent,

17:13.614 --> 17:15.115
at least for me it was.

17:15.183 --> 17:17.584
I'm not used to being
in a committed relationship,

17:17.652 --> 17:18.785
okay? it's kind of a first for me

17:18.853 --> 17:20.454
and I... I'm not clear
on all the rules.

17:20.521 --> 17:21.820
The rules?

17:21.888 --> 17:25.025
You mean like thou shall not hit on
thy girlfriend's best friend?

17:25.093 --> 17:27.327
Okay, "hitting on" is not what it was.

17:29.029 --> 17:30.430
Amy's a colleague

17:30.497 --> 17:32.998
and I need to stay casual and friendly
with her for business reasons.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.600
And I was wrong to suggest the movie,

17:34.668 --> 17:36.835
but I didn't intend anything by it.

17:36.903 --> 17:39.072
Are you really that dense
or do you think I am?

17:39.139 --> 17:41.174
No, I'm the dense one.
I am.

17:41.241 --> 17:43.742
And the thing that kills me
is that I've hurt you

17:43.810 --> 17:45.110
by being thoughtless and stupid.

17:45.178 --> 17:46.811
And I've been lying awake at night

17:46.879 --> 17:51.516
trying to figure out
how to make it up to you.

17:51.584 --> 17:53.651
You don't buy your way
out of the dog house, Chase.

17:55.588 --> 17:57.889
I'm gonna keep trying.

17:57.957 --> 17:59.691
I'm not giving up.

17:59.758 --> 18:01.325
You mean too much to me.

18:22.846 --> 18:24.647
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:26.550 --> 18:27.817
Coffee?

18:27.884 --> 18:28.951
Thanks.

18:30.287 --> 18:32.955
Listen, I'm gonna go give
Jack a hand this morning, okay?

18:33.023 --> 18:34.090
Okay.

18:37.594 --> 18:40.796
Honey, look, about last night, um...

18:40.864 --> 18:42.698
I never should've
brought up going away.

18:42.766 --> 18:45.434
It's the last thing I wanna do.

18:45.502 --> 18:48.770
And I love you, you're beautiful.

18:50.372 --> 18:51.673
You are.

18:52.808 --> 18:54.943
And you know what?
I want you to go ahead

18:55.011 --> 18:57.545
and buy that crazy running stroller.

18:57.613 --> 19:00.481
<i>If that's what you want,
that's what you should have.</i>

19:00.549 --> 19:01.482
<i>I gotta go.</i>

19:01.550 --> 19:02.617
Okay.

19:16.564 --> 19:17.865
All right, Addison,

19:17.932 --> 19:21.534
you gonna be a good boy
for Riana today, huh?

19:23.270 --> 19:25.004
Hey.
Good luck on your test.

19:25.072 --> 19:26.205
Thank you.

19:26.273 --> 19:28.240
Um, I just wanted to say

19:28.308 --> 19:30.209
that it's none of my business

19:30.277 --> 19:32.145
what you do with Chase or anyone else.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.246
<i>It's your call.</i>

19:34.314 --> 19:36.082
It's okay.

19:36.150 --> 19:38.016
I just hear the guy's name

19:38.084 --> 19:40.719
and it kinda rubs me the wro w way.

19:40.787 --> 19:41.853
I just don't like him

19:41.921 --> 19:42.888
and I know that's my problem

19:42.955 --> 19:44.189
<i>and not yours, so...</i>

19:44.256 --> 19:47.225
Yeah, I don't like him
all that much either, Ty.

19:47.293 --> 19:49.094
Really?

19:49.162 --> 19:50.228
Yeah, I mean,

19:50.296 --> 19:51.196
we have to work together sometimes,

19:51.263 --> 19:52.330
but that's it.

19:52.398 --> 19:53.798
But you fired him.

19:57.769 --> 20:00.437
It's none of my business.

20:01.940 --> 20:03.273
See ya.

20:03.341 --> 20:04.408
Yeah.

20:27.263 --> 20:28.831
Yeah, I...

20:28.898 --> 20:31.466
I don't like getting involved
in other people's problems,

20:31.534 --> 20:34.603
but Lou's getting worried about you.

20:34.670 --> 20:37.072
Yeah.

20:37.140 --> 20:39.074
And I'm not always

20:39.142 --> 20:40.508
the sharpest knife in the drawer,

20:40.576 --> 20:42.176
but even I can tell

20:42.244 --> 20:45.012
that the problem you had
before is getting bigger.

20:46.148 --> 20:47.181
Ah, it's not.

20:47.249 --> 20:49.117
It's not a big deal, Jack.

20:49.184 --> 20:50.818
Aw, don't B.S. me.

20:51.754 --> 20:54.388
If you wanna talk about it,
I'll listen;

20:54.456 --> 20:56.124
If you don't, fine.

20:59.260 --> 21:01.128
Okay. Well, um...

21:01.195 --> 21:02.328
Okay, yeah.

21:02.396 --> 21:03.463
I mean, I do have some problems,

21:03.530 --> 21:05.598
but I also have a very pregnant

21:05.666 --> 21:07.100
and somewhat hormonal wife at home,

21:07.168 --> 21:08.501
so I'm trying not to complicate things

21:08.569 --> 21:10.837
anymore than they already are,
you know?

21:10.905 --> 21:12.972
Sounds reasonable.

21:15.341 --> 21:17.709
So, tell me, when you...

21:18.645 --> 21:19.812
When your wife was pregnant

21:19.880 --> 21:22.648
and you had...
certain anxieties,

21:22.715 --> 21:24.784
did you tell her about 'em?

21:24.851 --> 21:26.585
Good lord, no.

21:28.121 --> 21:32.257
But, you know,
when a Bronc rider climbs on,

21:33.859 --> 21:35.726
he's gotta open the gate and ride

21:35.795 --> 21:37.461
or get off that animal.

21:37.529 --> 21:38.562
And if he doesn't,

21:38.630 --> 21:40.064
he might just get kicked to death

21:40.132 --> 21:41.199
right there in the chute,

21:41.267 --> 21:43.935
and that is no way to go.

21:48.472 --> 21:50.573
I'm not sure what we're
talking about here, Jack?

21:50.641 --> 21:52.976
We're talking about you.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.851
3-6-7-7.

22:01.952 --> 22:03.286
Um, 0-6-11.

22:04.121 --> 22:07.656
Yup. And that's for the "fit"
in green, right?

22:08.591 --> 22:09.658
Okay.

22:11.695 --> 22:14.396
I'm sorry? No.
There must be a mistake.

22:14.464 --> 22:15.731
Um...

22:16.533 --> 22:18.666
What, no explanation?
Just "refused"?

22:20.870 --> 22:23.004
Okay, I understand.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.041
Hey.
Hi.

22:26.108 --> 22:28.609
Um, so, weirdest thing just happened.

22:28.677 --> 22:29.711
What's that?

22:29.778 --> 22:31.379
I went to buy that stroller

22:31.447 --> 22:33.881
and the credit card was refused.

22:33.982 --> 22:37.017
- That's a mistake.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

22:37.085 --> 22:39.486
Can I see it?
You know what?

22:39.554 --> 22:41.055
I use this card in Dubai a lot.

22:41.122 --> 22:43.891
All the foreign travel...
They probably flagged it.

22:43.959 --> 22:45.692
I'll give 'em call and look into it.

23:06.445 --> 23:07.512
Good boy.

23:10.183 --> 23:11.683
Did you see?

23:11.751 --> 23:14.119
I think it's lots better.

23:14.187 --> 23:15.520
And what's different to you?

23:15.588 --> 23:17.022
I dunno,

23:17.090 --> 23:18.790
it's kind of like
we're talking to each other.

23:18.858 --> 23:20.192
Like I think what I want him to do

23:20.260 --> 23:22.159
and he does it.

23:22.227 --> 23:23.694
Well, that's only gonna
get better.

23:23.762 --> 23:25.062
Let's set up a few low jumps

23:25.130 --> 23:26.497
and let's see if you can
keep the nice even pace

23:26.564 --> 23:28.266
that you have.

23:32.237 --> 23:35.406
<i>I thought you
were out here training?</i>

23:35.473 --> 23:36.907
Where are the jumps?

23:36.974 --> 23:39.042
Dad, we're making
some progress I think.

23:39.110 --> 23:41.644
Why isn't she working
on her combinations?

23:41.712 --> 23:43.513
This isn't Pony club.

23:43.580 --> 23:44.714
She's got a short window

23:44.782 --> 23:46.316
to get a whole lot of work done.

23:46.384 --> 23:49.119
Dad, we were just about
to set up the jumps.

23:49.186 --> 23:50.820
Is that right?

23:50.888 --> 23:52.222
I'm paying you to get her ready.

23:52.290 --> 23:54.123
I'm paying you a lot!

23:54.190 --> 23:55.857
We were just about to start jumping.

23:55.926 --> 23:57.993
See that you do, please.

23:58.061 --> 24:00.462
Riana, you're running out of time.

24:00.530 --> 24:03.698
<i>You don't want to be embarassed
at Qualifiers, do you?</i>

24:03.766 --> 24:04.833
No, dad.

24:22.304 --> 24:23.404
Mallory!

24:24.339 --> 24:26.407
There's some guy, he wants to see you.

24:26.475 --> 24:28.109
What guy?

24:28.177 --> 24:30.145
Good looking guy.

24:30.212 --> 24:31.880
Just outside here.

24:32.815 --> 24:33.882
Right there.

24:38.619 --> 24:40.821
What are you doing?!

24:40.889 --> 24:43.257
I am in the middle of a shift!

24:43.324 --> 24:45.125
He needs to be brushed out,

24:45.193 --> 24:47.761
ridden a little,
and have his stall cleaned.

24:52.766 --> 24:55.567
And he misses you, obviously.

24:55.635 --> 24:57.770
What do you want me to do?
Quit my job?

24:57.838 --> 24:59.305
Should I take him over
to your folks place

24:59.372 --> 25:00.973
and turn him out in the yard?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.474
Or are you gonna do something good

25:02.542 --> 25:04.610
for this poor animal?

25:04.678 --> 25:07.113
Just take him home, okay?

25:07.181 --> 25:10.182
I'll be there in the morning.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.521
Good job, Copper.

25:20.359 --> 25:21.659
Honey?

25:21.727 --> 25:24.862
Did you talk
to the credit card company?

25:24.930 --> 25:26.530
Ah, no.
Not yet.

25:26.597 --> 25:27.764
I'll, uh...

25:27.833 --> 25:29.533
I'll give 'em a call later today.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.701
I'm just looking

25:30.768 --> 25:31.902
at the real estate listings in Calgary

25:31.970 --> 25:33.204
and the value
of the condo's gone way up.

25:33.271 --> 25:35.139
Oh really?

25:35.207 --> 25:36.540
<i>Yeah, it's a big bounce
back from two years ago.</i>

25:36.607 --> 25:38.275
I'm thinking maybe we should sell,

25:38.343 --> 25:40.476
while the market's up.

25:40.544 --> 25:41.945
Why would we sell?

25:42.012 --> 25:44.480
I thought we wanted
to keep a place in the city.

25:44.548 --> 25:47.150
Yeah. No, no reason.

25:47.218 --> 25:49.352
I just, uh...
I saw it as more

25:49.419 --> 25:50.486
of an investment property, you know?

25:50.554 --> 25:53.189
We're hardly ever in it and, uh...

25:53.257 --> 25:54.523
Anyway, just a thought.

25:56.059 --> 25:58.193
That's, uh...

26:03.099 --> 26:04.166
Honey.

26:05.668 --> 26:07.236
We're not in trouble, are we?

26:07.303 --> 26:09.537
No, of course not.
Why? Why do you ask?

26:09.605 --> 26:12.673
Because lately it's like
you're not really here.

26:12.741 --> 26:14.008
Well, I'm a little distracted,
to be honest.

26:14.076 --> 26:15.509
I got a lot of things on the go here.

26:15.577 --> 26:16.978
<i>Well, we need to talk it out.</i>

26:18.580 --> 26:19.680
There's nothing to talk out!
I don't know what it...

26:19.748 --> 26:21.249
why are you getting upset?

26:21.316 --> 26:22.549
I'm not, honey!
I just...

26:22.617 --> 26:23.918
You know, between you and Jack,

26:23.986 --> 26:24.952
I just feel like
I'm on the witness stand

26:25.020 --> 26:25.987
all the time here, you know?

26:26.054 --> 26:27.755
What? Okay, Peter,
you know what?

26:27.822 --> 26:29.222
We both know
there's something going on

26:29.290 --> 26:31.791
and why don't you
just tell me the truth?!

26:34.828 --> 26:36.162
Just answer it!

26:38.165 --> 26:40.300
Hey, Jennifer.

26:40.368 --> 26:42.369
I... I don't have an answer
for that right now, honestly,

26:42.436 --> 26:44.036
but... well,
have you contacted them?

26:46.472 --> 26:47.572
It's a little further over here.

26:50.410 --> 26:52.077
That's your solution, right there.

26:52.145 --> 26:53.512
It's a snaffle bit.

26:53.579 --> 26:55.147
I was gonna change out
Addison's bit anyway.

26:55.215 --> 26:56.882
It's not just any bit.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.817
It's a Chase Powers
"power bit."

26:58.885 --> 27:00.418
It's an ordinary bit, Chase.

27:00.485 --> 27:01.819
But you'll be using
the Chase Powers method.

27:01.887 --> 27:03.821
Which is what exactly?

27:03.889 --> 27:05.689
Which is instilling confidence.

27:05.757 --> 27:08.192
Look, I'll come by tomorrow
and I'll show you.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.427
This little baby's gonna save your job

27:09.494 --> 27:12.130
with Stewart Forrest, I promise.

27:12.197 --> 27:13.898
Okay, but you would do this
because...?

27:13.966 --> 27:16.133
Because it's how I'm launching
my whole product line.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.167
This is just the beginning.

27:17.235 --> 27:19.136
I got big plans.

27:20.171 --> 27:22.072
Soraya! Soraya, please!

27:22.140 --> 27:23.773
I'm a little busy, Amy.

27:23.841 --> 27:25.375
Just wait.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.610
Look, I can't stand this anymore.

27:27.678 --> 27:29.146
You're my best friend

27:29.213 --> 27:30.847
and I hate that there's
this thing between us now.

27:30.915 --> 27:32.949
Well, I didn't put it there.

27:32.983 --> 27:35.284
Can't we just work this out?

27:35.352 --> 27:37.420
Look, Chase told me that
he explained everything.

27:38.355 --> 27:39.388
Honestly, Amy,

27:39.456 --> 27:41.824
I don't know who to trust anymore.

27:41.891 --> 27:42.825
I'm really confused.

27:42.892 --> 27:44.260
I just need my space, okay?

27:57.006 --> 27:59.341
Peter you awake?

29:05.470 --> 29:06.537
Oh, my God.

29:18.782 --> 29:20.450
You lost?

29:20.518 --> 29:22.352
Just waiting for Amy.

29:22.420 --> 29:23.486
Oh.

29:24.987 --> 29:26.388
So you having any luck?

29:26.456 --> 29:27.756
With what?

29:27.823 --> 29:29.291
You know, patching things up
with the ex?

29:29.359 --> 29:32.694
I mean, why else would you
come crawling back to Heartland?

29:32.762 --> 29:34.530
I don't have to explain myself to you.

29:34.597 --> 29:36.765
I'm just making conversation
there, big guy.

29:36.832 --> 29:39.334
Amy, Chase is here to see ya.

29:39.402 --> 29:40.968
Thanks.

29:41.036 --> 29:43.137
Um, Riana, this is Chase Powers.

29:43.205 --> 29:44.372
Good to meet you!

29:44.440 --> 29:45.540
Ready to try Chase Powers' method?

29:45.607 --> 29:47.208
I have never, never had a client

29:47.276 --> 29:48.209
that didn't become a better rider

29:48.277 --> 29:49.410
on the first day,

29:49.478 --> 29:52.547
and the secret is this new bit.

29:53.482 --> 29:54.748
Really?

29:54.816 --> 29:56.783
Now, listen, your dad's
the best there is,

29:56.850 --> 29:58.952
but that bit he's got you using
is getting in your way.

29:59.019 --> 30:00.687
This new Chase Powers "power bit"

30:00.754 --> 30:02.622
is made for riders
at exactly your level.

30:02.690 --> 30:05.258
So what do you say,
you wanna give it a shot?

30:05.326 --> 30:06.393
Okay!

30:07.428 --> 30:09.296
You won't be sorry.

30:10.231 --> 30:11.831
It's just an ordinary soft bit.

30:11.899 --> 30:13.132
I know that and you know that,

30:13.200 --> 30:14.467
but she doesn't have to know that.

30:14.534 --> 30:17.736
It's about selling confidence.

30:17.804 --> 30:19.071
<i>I can't believe you
went behind my back!</i>

30:19.139 --> 30:20.772
What else was I supposed to do?

30:20.840 --> 30:22.975
You wouldn't tell me anything.

30:23.042 --> 30:24.276
We're supposed to trust each other.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.612
Don't talk to me about trust, Peter!

30:26.679 --> 30:28.480
You're the one
who said everything was fine

30:28.547 --> 30:30.014
and obviously it's not!

30:30.082 --> 30:31.583
I'm dealing with it.

30:31.650 --> 30:33.118
Why wouldn't you tell me?

30:33.185 --> 30:34.986
Did you think it was over my head?

30:35.053 --> 30:37.355
I have my MBA, remember?
I'm not stupid.

30:37.423 --> 30:38.356
I'm taking care of it, Lou!

30:38.424 --> 30:39.857
I just said that.
Please.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.192
Really?

30:41.260 --> 30:43.894
How are you taking care of it, Peter?

30:43.962 --> 30:45.829
All four of the banks
that Bedford deals with

30:45.896 --> 30:48.465
are calling in their loans
simultaneously.

30:48.533 --> 30:50.501
Your personal line of credit
is maxed out,

30:50.568 --> 30:53.170
all the credit cards are stopped.

30:53.238 --> 30:54.571
Where did the money go, Peter?

30:57.708 --> 30:59.343
<i>I wanna know what's going
on and, most importantly,</i>

30:59.410 --> 31:01.511
I wanna know why you didn't tell me?!

31:01.578 --> 31:04.380
I didn't tell you, Lou,
because of this!

31:04.448 --> 31:06.182
Okay?

31:06.250 --> 31:07.816
I didn't want you to flip out.

31:07.884 --> 31:09.484
That is so patronizing
and condescending!

31:09.552 --> 31:10.685
I can't even believe

31:10.753 --> 31:12.053
it just came out of your mouth!

31:12.988 --> 31:15.290
And while we are talking about trust,

31:15.358 --> 31:18.026
who the hell is Jennifer?

31:19.962 --> 31:21.329
Jennifer?

31:21.397 --> 31:22.531
Yeah!

31:22.598 --> 31:24.431
Jennifer is a lawyer.

31:24.499 --> 31:25.732
One of the many lawyers that I have

31:25.800 --> 31:27.934
trying to dig us
out of this mess, Okay?

31:28.002 --> 31:29.403
Who'd you think she was, Lou?

31:29.471 --> 31:30.704
What mess?

31:31.573 --> 31:33.507
Okay, you wanna know exactly
what's going on?

31:33.575 --> 31:34.708
Yes!

31:34.776 --> 31:36.577
Okay, Bedford Oil
is about two days away

31:36.645 --> 31:37.911
from insolvency...

31:37.979 --> 31:39.547
that's personal
and professional bankruptcy.

31:39.614 --> 31:40.680
I'm broke!

31:41.882 --> 31:43.082
I mean, I'm so screwed

31:43.150 --> 31:44.850
I don't even know
if I can afford baby food,

31:44.918 --> 31:48.054
let alone expensive
baby strollers, okay?

31:48.121 --> 31:49.189
Happy?

32:28.593 --> 32:30.159
Woo-hoo!

32:30.228 --> 32:31.894
Look at you!
Great work!

32:33.831 --> 32:35.765
You feel the difference?
It's amazing, isn't it?

32:35.833 --> 32:37.267
You were totally right!

32:37.335 --> 32:38.735
This is way, way better.

32:38.802 --> 32:39.969
Wow.

32:40.037 --> 32:42.739
That's all you;
That wasn't me.

32:42.806 --> 32:44.473
I think I'm ready
for the big jumps.

32:44.541 --> 32:45.674
Absolutely!

32:45.742 --> 32:47.643
Okay, but let's not go too fast.

32:47.711 --> 32:49.378
All right?

32:49.446 --> 32:51.247
You're welcome.

32:55.518 --> 32:57.386
Mr. Forrest.
Good to see you again.

32:57.454 --> 32:58.687
Chase Powers.

32:58.755 --> 33:00.188
Your daughter's gonna be a fine rider.

33:00.256 --> 33:01.822
I know.

33:01.890 --> 33:04.325
Amy, I thought I made it clear

33:04.393 --> 33:07.061
I wanted Riana working
on her combinations.

33:07.129 --> 33:08.763
This is a course
for five-year-olds.

33:08.830 --> 33:11.299
She needs to be schooling
a meter at least.

33:11.367 --> 33:13.000
We've actually been doing
the basic work necessary

33:13.068 --> 33:14.469
to get your daughter
in a good relationship

33:14.536 --> 33:15.202
with her new horse.

33:15.271 --> 33:16.536
It's okay, dad.

33:16.604 --> 33:17.971
We're trying out a new bit

33:18.038 --> 33:19.573
and that's making all the
difference in the world.

33:19.641 --> 33:21.141
A new bit?

33:21.208 --> 33:22.242
Why are you changing his bit?

33:22.310 --> 33:23.610
I explained this already.

33:23.678 --> 33:25.479
Dad, let me show you.

33:25.546 --> 33:28.948
I'm actually getting better.
Watch this!

33:45.899 --> 33:46.865
Riana, don't do the big jumps;

33:46.933 --> 33:48.366
We haven't worked on them yet.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.440
Riana!

33:55.508 --> 33:57.375
Pull him up!

34:02.114 --> 34:03.481
Riana!

34:03.549 --> 34:05.349
Riana!

34:08.052 --> 34:09.320
Honey, are you okay?

34:09.387 --> 34:11.154
I'm sorry, daddy.

34:12.089 --> 34:13.190
I'm so sorry.

34:13.257 --> 34:15.125
Let me have a look at your arm.

34:16.328 --> 34:17.860
Okay, I'm taking you to a hospital.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.330
And you, get my horse back!

34:22.866 --> 34:24.567
You're okay.
Whoa.

34:25.502 --> 34:26.936
Good boy.
You're okay.

34:27.871 --> 34:29.103
You're okay.

34:40.817 --> 34:42.217
He's hurt.

35:14.528 --> 35:16.696
How long have you known?

35:17.631 --> 35:19.399
Couple months.

35:19.466 --> 35:22.667
Before I found out I was pregnant?

35:22.735 --> 35:24.369
Way before that.

35:25.304 --> 35:27.906
When I was still in Dubai?

35:27.973 --> 35:30.141
Yup.

35:33.613 --> 35:35.947
All those long hours...
the dinners...

35:36.015 --> 35:39.082
the...
the never being home...

35:43.688 --> 35:45.423
what happened?

35:49.594 --> 35:50.795
You know we borrowed pretty heavily

35:50.862 --> 35:53.631
when we partnered
with El Alyria, right?

35:53.698 --> 35:56.533
We were told our level
of foreign investment

35:56.600 --> 35:59.335
was allowed
in the United Arab Emirates.

35:59.403 --> 36:00.870
But it turns out that El Alyria lied

36:00.938 --> 36:03.239
about their own resources.

36:03.307 --> 36:04.307
How could they do that?

36:04.374 --> 36:05.875
They did,

36:05.943 --> 36:07.176
and they seized all our assets

36:07.244 --> 36:10.079
and now our banks
want their money back.

36:14.183 --> 36:16.051
You know, I thought I could
find a way out of this mess

36:16.118 --> 36:20.221
until the UAE courts
refused to even hear our case.

36:20.289 --> 36:23.459
And that's why you're always
on the phone.

36:24.393 --> 36:26.727
Yeah. Lawyers, bankers...

36:26.795 --> 36:29.363
Anyone who's got a connection.

36:30.532 --> 36:34.268
I've been making phones ring
all over Dubai.

36:35.270 --> 36:38.405
It's not how I planned it, Lou.

36:39.708 --> 36:41.909
God, I really screwed things up.

36:42.844 --> 36:44.644
Hey!

36:44.712 --> 36:47.647
We're gonna get through this.

36:47.715 --> 36:50.383
We could lose everything.

36:53.588 --> 36:55.388
Not everything.

37:05.665 --> 37:08.367
So I guess that Chase Powers bit
worked out real well.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.569
That's not why he crashed.

37:10.637 --> 37:12.204
Riana's way over mounted on Addison.

37:12.271 --> 37:15.106
Chase was just trying
to get her confidence back.

37:15.173 --> 37:16.474
If it takes a little salesmanship,

37:16.542 --> 37:17.609
what's the harm?

37:17.676 --> 37:19.377
Sounds like
you drank the Kool-aid.

37:19.444 --> 37:20.478
You know what?
All you can think about

37:20.546 --> 37:22.313
is butting heads with Chase.

37:22.381 --> 37:24.715
The less I have to do
with Chase the better.

37:26.751 --> 37:28.085
Stewart. Um...

37:28.153 --> 37:29.353
We've just called our vet.

37:29.421 --> 37:30.821
He's gonna come check Addison.

37:30.889 --> 37:34.025
Thank you, but I'll have
my vet deal with this.

37:34.092 --> 37:35.826
I want this horse trailered

37:35.894 --> 37:38.028
and brought back
to my barn immediately.

37:38.095 --> 37:39.829
Okay.
How's Riana?

37:40.764 --> 37:43.166
She has a badly sprained wrist.

37:43.234 --> 37:44.234
Your job was to get them ready

37:44.301 --> 37:45.668
for competition in two weeks,

37:45.736 --> 37:49.339
but instead you managed
to injure them both.

37:49.407 --> 37:51.508
Amy wasn't the one riding the horse.

37:51.575 --> 37:54.943
I suggest you stay out of this, son.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.913
I put a lot of bit
on that horse for a reason.

37:57.980 --> 38:01.083
You put my daughter on
a Ferrari with no brakes.

38:01.151 --> 38:03.952
I was trying to get
her confidence back.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.155
Riana is just terrified
of disappointing you.

38:06.222 --> 38:08.723
Don't try to blame this on me.

38:08.791 --> 38:11.159
That magazine cover?

38:11.226 --> 38:14.862
I made you into the miracle girl;

38:15.797 --> 38:17.798
I can unmake you.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.675
Yeah, that's the long form agreement.

38:28.742 --> 38:31.378
I combed it a million times.

38:31.446 --> 38:33.813
You have a solid case.

38:34.748 --> 38:37.150
Yeah, maybe if the judge
is from Pincher Creek I do.

38:37.218 --> 38:40.120
Well, then you have to go there.

38:40.188 --> 38:41.354
You have to stand in their kitchen

38:41.422 --> 38:42.888
and bang your fists on the tables

38:42.956 --> 38:44.190
and demand justice.

38:45.125 --> 38:46.525
And if that doesn't work,

38:46.593 --> 38:48.860
then we'll go at it
from the diplomatic angle.

38:48.928 --> 38:52.664
Bring in the International
Trade Commission.

39:03.509 --> 39:06.177
I am so glad you're on my team...

39:06.245 --> 39:09.414
And I'm sorry I kept it from you.

39:09.482 --> 39:13.251
You know, I didn't expect to be
facing fatherhood and bankruptcy

39:13.319 --> 39:14.651
at the same time.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.953
We're not there yet.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.366
You're mad at me too?

39:29.434 --> 39:30.766
I can tell.

39:31.701 --> 39:34.069
I can't be everywhere at once.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.772
Better late than never, I guess.

39:37.707 --> 39:39.609
I used to love coming here.

39:39.676 --> 39:42.311
Heartland was like
a second home to me.

39:42.379 --> 39:44.614
Now everything has changed.

39:44.681 --> 39:48.049
I don't know what to tell you
about that, Mallory.

39:48.117 --> 39:50.985
Maybe you've changed
a little yourself.

40:08.170 --> 40:09.436
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:09.504 --> 40:11.505
- Sign here, please.
- Sure.

40:18.079 --> 40:19.745
Good.. thanks.

40:30.957 --> 40:32.091
What's that?

40:32.159 --> 40:34.626
It's a Demand letter.

40:34.694 --> 40:36.094
Oh my God.

40:37.597 --> 40:39.798
Stewart Forrest intends
to sue Heartland

40:39.865 --> 40:40.932
for negligence.

40:46.539 --> 40:48.340
Amy, you know there has to be
paperwork done

40:48.408 --> 40:49.974
on every horse
that comes to Heartland.

40:50.042 --> 40:51.108
I know.

40:51.176 --> 40:52.210
So Stewart didn't sign anything?

40:52.277 --> 40:53.344
No waiver,

40:53.412 --> 40:54.345
no contract for services, nothing?

40:54.413 --> 40:55.446
Stewart Forrest...

40:55.514 --> 40:56.414
I just figured it wouldn't matter.

40:56.481 --> 40:57.582
Amy!

40:57.649 --> 40:59.083
Besides, Lou,

40:59.150 --> 41:00.251
every time he came here,

41:00.319 --> 41:01.485
he was telling me off about something.

41:01.553 --> 41:02.853
I just didn't feel
like the timing was right.

41:02.921 --> 41:04.388
Okay, okay...

41:06.057 --> 41:08.391
Well, that makes it
his word against yours,

41:08.459 --> 41:09.859
I guess.

41:09.927 --> 41:13.396
So an Olympic trainer
against a no-name kid.

41:13.464 --> 41:15.198
I don't stand a chance.

41:29.509 --> 41:31.309
Hey, Soraya.

41:31.377 --> 41:32.477
Hey!

41:32.545 --> 41:33.478
Um, I heard you're having some trouble

41:33.546 --> 41:34.780
with Stewart Forrest.

41:34.848 --> 41:37.215
Good news travels fast, huh?

41:37.283 --> 41:39.684
Well, I'm sorry to hear it.

41:40.619 --> 41:42.186
Are we okay?

41:45.524 --> 41:47.224
I think so.

41:49.161 --> 41:50.628
Okay, good.

41:58.602 --> 42:00.771
Amy! Check out
the next thing.

42:00.838 --> 42:02.305
Chase Powers' signature horses.

42:02.373 --> 42:04.708
Pre-trained... no muss, no fuss.

42:04.776 --> 42:06.576
Pay a premium,
but you get a luxury model

42:06.644 --> 42:09.179
totally tacked out and test driven.

42:09.246 --> 42:10.613
It's gonna be big.

42:10.682 --> 42:13.282
Stewart Forrest is suing me.

42:13.349 --> 42:14.884
She got too enthusiastic.
It happens.

42:14.951 --> 42:16.418
Chase, you egged her on.

42:16.486 --> 42:17.753
No, I didn't.

42:17.821 --> 42:19.655
I'm the better maker,
the confidence giver.

42:19.723 --> 42:21.490
I solve problems,
watch the DVD.

42:21.558 --> 42:23.959
No, you make more problems
than you solve.

42:24.027 --> 42:25.695
I'm sick of it.

42:25.762 --> 42:28.429
Chase Powers' signature horses.
