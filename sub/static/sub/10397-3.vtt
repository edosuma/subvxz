<i>What does it mean to be strong?</i>

00:09.217 --> 00:12.888
<i>It implies hardness, inflexibility.</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:17.934
<i>Okinawa is a place with a fighting tradition.</i>

00:17.935 --> 00:22.313
<i>A history of ferocious resistance.</i>

01:15.492 --> 01:17.451
<i>This is Okinawa.</i>

01:17.452 --> 01:20.039
<i>Just south of mainland Japan.</i>

01:21.498 --> 01:24.082
<i>For all the relative rigidity of the mainland,</i>

01:24.083 --> 01:26.878
<i>Okinawa answers in its own unique way.</i>

01:26.879 --> 01:30.130
<i>Don't eat the same thing each day. That's boring.</i>

01:30.131 --> 01:32.008
<i>There's even an Okinawan term for it,</i>

01:32.009 --> 01:34.552
<i>"chanpuru," something mixed.</i>

01:34.553 --> 01:38.180
<i>Bits borrowed from all over,
served up for anyone to eat.</i>

01:38.181 --> 01:41.099
<i>But maybe you're more familiar
with the name, Okinawa,</i>

01:41.100 --> 01:43.310
<i>from this, as the setting</i>

01:43.311 --> 01:45.772
<i>for some of the most horrifyingly bloody battles</i>

01:45.773 --> 01:49.651
<i>of the Second World War. How horrifying?</i>

01:52.446 --> 01:55.531
<i>For the Allies, there were
more than 50,000 casualties</i>

01:55.532 --> 01:58.492
<i>with around 12,000 killed or missing in action,</i>

01:58.493 --> 02:01.662
<i>over nearly three months of fighting.</i>

02:01.663 --> 02:04.624
<i>More than 100,000 Japanese soldiers</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:08.461
<i>and Okinawan conscripts were
killed defending the island.</i>

02:08.461 --> 02:11.505
<i>Civilians were stuck in the
middle of the two armies</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:12.924
<i>and got crushed.</i>

02:12.925 --> 02:14.884
<i>No one will know for sure,</i>

02:14.885 --> 02:19.597
<i>but historians estimate 150,000
men, women, and children</i>

02:19.598 --> 02:23.267
<i>lost their lives during the battle.</i>

02:23.268 --> 02:25.937
<i>What most don't know is that Okinawa had only</i>

02:25.938 --> 02:28.564
<i>become Japan fairly recently.</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:31.692
<i>That to a great extent,
Okinawans didn't even consider</i>

02:31.693 --> 02:35.195
<i>themselves really Japanese, or vice versa.</i>

02:35.196 --> 02:37.991
<i>That Okinawans and Japanese considered themselves</i>

02:37.992 --> 02:41.327
<i>to be different ethnicities,
spoke two different languages</i>

02:41.328 --> 02:43.955
<i>and culturally, culinarily, and in many other ways</i>

02:43.956 --> 02:46.206
<i>looked in different directions.</i>

02:46.207 --> 02:52.046
<i>Yet, Okinawans were asked to
make the ultimate sacrifice,</i>

02:52.047 --> 02:55.299
<i>and they did.</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:57.885
<i>That's not just ancient history.</i>

02:57.886 --> 03:01.681
<i>It informs the present, still.</i>

03:01.682 --> 03:04.767
<i>Okinawa is the largest of over 100 islands</i>

03:04.768 --> 03:07.603
<i>making up the Ryukyu island chain.</i>

03:07.604 --> 03:12.275
<i>It's just over 300 miles from
the mainland, but worlds apart.</i>

03:13.610 --> 03:16.487
<i>Okinawa is different.</i>

03:16.488 --> 03:19.281
<i>It's tropical. Clear waters.</i>

03:19.282 --> 03:21.034
<i>Some of the best beaches in Asia,</i>

03:21.035 --> 03:23.911
<i>with a decidedly more laid back, less frenetic,</i>

03:23.912 --> 03:28.290
<i>self-serious attitude than the mainland.</i>

03:28.291 --> 03:32.753
<i>You can feel it. You can see it.</i>

03:32.754 --> 03:35.757
<i>It's just different here.</i>

03:42.056 --> 03:47.226
<i>2,000 pounds of heavily muscled
beef enters the arena.</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:51.064
<i>You can feel the ground shake
under its heavy hooves.</i>

03:51.065 --> 03:54.026
<i>His opponent awaits.</i>

03:56.528 --> 03:59.864
<i>Togyu, also known as ushi-zumo</i>

03:59.865 --> 04:04.078
<i>sumo, yes, but bull sumo.</i>

04:11.210 --> 04:13.669
<i>These are professionals,</i>

04:13.670 --> 04:17.255
<i>and like Jake LaMotta and Chuck Wepner before them,</i>

04:17.257 --> 04:21.301
<i>they shall live to fight, or
do other stuff, another day.</i>

04:21.302 --> 04:24.388
<i>Having shed decidedly less blood than either</i>

04:24.389 --> 04:26.016
<i>of those two gentlemen.</i>

04:29.561 --> 04:31.896
<i>Two animals, two handlers.</i>

04:31.897 --> 04:35.233
<i>And they do, like, the Burgess
Meredith job in</i> Rocky.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.359
<i>Like fighters in sumo, the bulls are ranked</i>

04:37.360 --> 04:40.362
<i>by their ability, their record in the ring.</i>

04:40.363 --> 04:43.157
<i>The highest being yokozuna.</i>

04:43.158 --> 04:45.868
<i>This is Kenny Aman. He lives up the road.</i>

04:45.869 --> 04:48.871
Is there a time limit or do
they go till somebody gives up?

04:48.872 --> 04:52.208
I think they pretty much go
until somebody gives up.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.668
When it gets... -A points system?

04:54.669 --> 04:57.213
No, no, there's no points system.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.299
Basically, when the other one
turns around and runs away,

05:00.300 --> 05:02.885
that's the winner.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.054
Few times one bull will
actually get around to the side

05:05.055 --> 05:06.680
and actually be able to flip the bull over.

05:06.681 --> 05:10.226
Right. Win, lose or survive? Both?

05:10.227 --> 05:12.770
Once in a while, you'll have injuries,

05:12.771 --> 05:15.231
but most of the time the bulls go home.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.233
They go home to be happy. -They do.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.359
Nobody's turned into steak or cutlets.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.279
No.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.363
<i>Togyu started as early as the 17th century</i>

05:23.364 --> 05:26.075
<i>with farmers pitting bull against bull.</i>

05:26.076 --> 05:28.368
<i>They love it in agricultural communities like this,</i>

05:28.369 --> 05:30.246
<i>so much so that it was briefly banned</i>

05:30.247 --> 05:32.832
<i>in some places because farmers
were spending too much time</i>

05:32.833 --> 05:36.294
<i>at the fights and not enough
time growing sugarcane.</i>

05:36.295 --> 05:38.838
<i>Like Cus D'Amato and the young Tyson,</i>

05:38.839 --> 05:42.091
<i>their handlers raise these beasts from calves,</i>

05:42.092 --> 05:43.509
<i>caring for them on one hand,</i>

05:43.510 --> 05:45.303
<i>and training them, conditioning them</i>

05:45.304 --> 05:49.224
<i>to be monsters in the ring on the other.</i>

05:50.142 --> 05:53.187
Oh! -Oh!

06:03.571 --> 06:06.908
Yeah. Does one wager on this?

06:08.243 --> 06:12.079
I guess the official answer would be

06:12.080 --> 06:17.459
that gambling's illegal in Japan, but...

06:17.460 --> 06:19.545
<i>Intermission.</i>

<i>No. Better. Much better. Yakitori.</i>

06:26.053 --> 06:28.888

06:28.889 --> 06:32.183

Oh, yeah. -Oh, he's ready to go.

This is the tofu, which you eat a little at a time.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.506
Is it that strong? -It is a little strong, yeah.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.551
It has, like, a cheese type of texture.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.474

09:18.475 --> 09:21.435
So you grew up in New Jersey.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.897
How did you find your way to Okinawa?

09:24.898 --> 09:28.901
Well, my mom was from here. My dad was in the Navy.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.903
Mm-hm. -He was stationed here.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.323
Met my mom and wound up back in New Jersey

09:34.324 --> 09:36.116
because that's where my dad was from, Paterson.

09:36.117 --> 09:39.119
And I was born and raised there.

09:39.120 --> 09:44.624
The school I went to was
predominantly Caucasian kids.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.920
There wasn't many Asian-Americans at all.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.713
Right. -And I always had

09:49.714 --> 09:53.675
this kind of, like, identity complex.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.178
There would be, like, times where people would come

09:56.179 --> 09:58.514
to the house. They'd say,
"Oh, where's your mom from?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.974
"- Is she from China?" -Oh, God, right.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.769
Open the refrigerator and there
would be some weird food.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.439
"Hey, what's that?" Every time I heard that,

10:06.440 --> 10:09.400
I was like, wow, am I, like, am I different?

10:09.401 --> 10:11.735
So one day my mom says

10:11.736 --> 10:14.572
we're going back to Okinawa on a family trip.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.407
I was 17 years old. -You'd never been

10:16.408 --> 10:18.075
up to that point? -No, but when I got off

10:18.076 --> 10:20.578
the plane, I don't know what it was.

10:20.579 --> 10:24.582
It was like, I'm here, this is my home.

10:24.583 --> 10:28.961
Being able to connect to my
heritage, I felt something.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.880
I was like, wow, I belong here.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.008
How about the food? What was in that refrigerator?

10:35.009 --> 10:39.054
Because I know a lot of kids who
grew up with that same sort

10:39.055 --> 10:42.266
of uncertainty

10:42.267 --> 10:44.726
when they brought their friends home from school

10:44.727 --> 10:47.146
to their house and opened the refrigerator.

10:47.147 --> 10:51.942
You know, kimchee, or cabbage, or fish sauce.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.278
They were aware of it when
they visited their friends.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.071
And they were acutely uncomfortable with it

10:56.072 --> 10:59.199
when their friends came over.
Man, have things changed,

10:59.200 --> 11:01.785
as far as attitudes,

11:01.786 --> 11:05.456
pretty much the engine of the new American cuisine,

11:05.457 --> 11:07.833
are kids with childhoods like yours.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.044
I don't mean what's hip, what's the next new thing.

11:11.045 --> 11:16.425
I mean, literally redefining
what is American cuisine.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.636
Let's put it this way.

11:18.637 --> 11:22.264
The central irony of this story is that, you know,

11:22.265 --> 11:24.892
your mom would have been, like, hipster hero.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.980
<i>Still another American invasion</i>

11:29.981 --> 11:32.690
<i>in the Pacific. The objective is Okinawa,</i>

11:32.691 --> 11:35.528
<i>one of the ring of island
fortresses protecting Japan</i>

11:35.529 --> 11:38.280
<i>300 miles away.</i>

11:38.281 --> 11:41.699
<i>On April 1st, 1945,</i>

11:41.700 --> 11:45.204
<i>a U.S. invasion fleet of nearly 1,500 ships,</i>

11:45.205 --> 11:49.333
<i>a landing force of 182,000 people,</i>

11:49.334 --> 11:53.587
<i>that's 75,000 more than
Normandy, approached Okinawa.</i>

11:53.588 --> 11:57.466
<i>What came next was what Okinawans called</i>

11:57.467 --> 12:00.428
<i>a typhoon of steel.</i>

12:04.932 --> 12:07.226
<i>Having island hopped across the Pacific,</i>

12:07.227 --> 12:11.522
<i>Allied forces saw Okinawa as a
key base for fleet anchorage,</i>

12:11.523 --> 12:14.358
<i>troop staging and air operations for the final push</i>

12:14.359 --> 12:16.985
<i>into the Japanese mainland and victory.</i>

12:16.986 --> 12:20.030
<i>The fighting was brutal for both sides.</i>

12:20.031 --> 12:23.116
<i>The cost in lives and resources
for the Allied forces</i>

12:23.117 --> 12:25.536
<i>was tremendous. And when it was over,</i>

12:25.537 --> 12:28.163
<i>military planners looked at the mainland,</i>

12:28.164 --> 12:30.374
<i>looked at what Okinawa had cost them,</i>

12:30.375 --> 12:34.294
<i>and projected even more appalling losses.</i>

12:34.295 --> 12:37.465
<i>What came next, we all know.</i>

12:40.218 --> 12:43.429
<i>What is not widely known is that more people died</i>

12:43.430 --> 12:46.181
<i>during the Battle of Okinawa than all those killed</i>

12:46.182 --> 12:51.229
<i>during the atomic bombings
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</i>

13:03.408 --> 13:05.743
Right. -So they had to

13:05.744 --> 13:10.247
keep the U.S. military forces as long as possible

13:10.248 --> 13:13.959
in Okinawa, so that they could prepare defense

13:13.960 --> 13:16.253
to protect mainland Japan.

13:16.254 --> 13:21.091
So ever since the Battle of Okinawa,

13:21.092 --> 13:25.387
Okinawan people say we were sort of...

13:25.388 --> 13:28.181
What do you call it? -Sacrifice?

13:28.182 --> 13:30.392
Yes. Uh-huh.

13:30.393 --> 13:34.313
<i>Masahide Ota is a former governor of Okinawa.</i>

13:34.314 --> 13:37.524

<i>then dressed with sugar and soy.</i>

14:58.189 --> 15:03.152
<i>And pork shoulder dredged in
black sesame then steamed.</i>

15:08.742 --> 15:13.078
You have described that, uh,

15:13.079 --> 15:18.166
you were shocked and surprised
to see the Japanese soldiers,

15:18.167 --> 15:22.422
their treatment of Okinawans was
not good during the battle.

15:39.272 --> 15:43.024
And if you use the Okinawan language,

15:43.025 --> 15:46.278
you will be killed as a spy, you know?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.154
Right. -But Okinawan people

15:48.155 --> 15:50.824
could not understand standard language.

15:50.825 --> 15:55.871
So when Japanese soldiers
killed lots of local people...

15:55.872 --> 15:59.583
Particularly given the experience of the war,

15:59.584 --> 16:03.378
how Japanese do you think most people feel here?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.672
There's a fundamental difference between

16:05.673 --> 16:08.508
Japanese culture and Okinawan culture.

16:08.509 --> 16:12.095
Japanese culture is war culture,

16:12.096 --> 16:15.725
but Okinawan culture is absence of militarism.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.018
Okinawan people are happy-go-lucky people.

16:19.019 --> 16:21.772
Do you think that easygoing...

16:21.773 --> 16:26.610
that reputation, that tradition
of being happy-go-lucky,

16:26.611 --> 16:28.194
do you think this has led

16:28.195 --> 16:30.572
to Okinawans being taken advantage of?

16:30.573 --> 16:35.327
I mean, for instance, the U.S. military bases.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.872
Okinawa is one percent of the landmass of Japan,

16:38.873 --> 16:41.708
and yet what percentage of the military bases

16:41.709 --> 16:44.419
are here on Okinawa? Almost all of them.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.464
Okinawa seems to be asked to
make a lot of sacrifices,

16:47.465 --> 16:51.384
uh, for the mainland. Will that ever step?

16:51.385 --> 16:54.137
You are talking about NIMBY.

21:07.433 --> 21:12.729
So, Okinawa's most famous
export, perhaps, is karate.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.273
Uh-huh. -When most of us think

21:15.274 --> 21:19.485
of karate, we think of striking. Exclusively.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.739
Is that an accurate representation

21:22.740 --> 21:25.158
of what you're doing? -The
basis of Okinawan karate

21:25.159 --> 21:29.704
is that it was used primarily as a defensive art.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.539
In other words, being able to, you know,

21:31.540 --> 21:34.667
control and subdue the opponent.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.170
Usually if you could, in a humane way,

21:37.171 --> 21:39.672
but then if you had to finish them,

21:39.673 --> 21:41.299
then you had the ability to finish them.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.135
The striking is important,

21:43.136 --> 21:45.637
but a lot of the technique is not about striking.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.680
It's about submission techniques.

21:47.681 --> 21:51.268
Some of that is to do with
kyushu, attacking nervepoints.

21:51.269 --> 21:53.478
And Hokama Sensei, in particular,

21:53.479 --> 21:58.150
is extremely skilled at dealing with, you know,

21:58.151 --> 22:01.319
bigger, stronger opponents. -Human engineering.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.488
Very important.

22:03.489 --> 22:07.075
Point, point, point, point, point,

22:07.076 --> 22:10.036
Point, point, point, point,

22:10.037 --> 22:13.414
then this point.

22:13.415 --> 22:19.254
No... No... open.

<i>The demonstration of Hokama Sensei's open-hand</i>

22:22.049 --> 22:27.513
<i>kyushu technique becomes a

22:30.141 --> 22:31.599

22:31.600 --> 22:35.312
<i>Human engineering with a terrifying logic,</i>

22:35.313 --> 22:37.897
<i>one attacks the weak point.</i>

22:37.898 --> 22:39.774
<i>All I know how to do in this situation, by the way,</i>

22:39.775 --> 22:43.569
<i>is pull guard and look for
something to choke or lock.</i>

22:43.570 --> 22:46.239
<i>Nope. Apparently, they don't know</i>

22:46.240 --> 22:48.616
<i>what tapping out means here. I was tapping</i>

22:53.413 --> 22:55.165
<i>right into my brain pan.</i>

22:55.166 --> 22:58.210
There was a saying in the old
days if there was a fight

22:58.211 --> 23:02.547
happening somewhere in town,
people would go have a look

23:02.548 --> 23:04.549

23:04.550 --> 23:07.635
with fists or open hands? If
they're fighting with fists,

23:07.636 --> 23:09.554
they'd say, don't bother, it's an amateur fight.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.015
If they were fighting with open hands,

23:12.016 --> 23:13.517

27:21.098 --> 27:25.184

for the entire country.</i>

27:25.185 --> 27:28.563
<i>Currently there are close to
30 military installations</i>

27:28.564 --> 27:32.400
<i>on Okinawa, and even though
it's one of the smallest</i>

27:32.401 --> 27:35.278
<i>Japanese prefectures in terms of livable area,</i>

27:35.279 --> 27:37.196
<i>they accommodate more than half</i>

27:37.197 --> 27:40.699
<i>of the foreign military presence.</i>

27:40.700 --> 27:45.037
<i>Even more problematic, much
of Okinawa's arable land</i>

27:45.038 --> 27:47.499
<i>suitable for farming on an island whose whole</i>

27:47.500 --> 27:50.042

<i>is eaten up by military bases.</i>

27:58.511 --> 28:01.387
The military base issue, is this more important

28:01.388 --> 28:03.139
for older people or younger people?

28:03.140 --> 28:05.682
- It's for older people.
- It's for the older people.

28:05.683 --> 28:09.479
Yes. So when you actually go to
a place where they have, like,

28:09.480 --> 28:13.149
a protest going on, I will say
over 80 percent of the people

28:13.150 --> 28:18.237
- are all retired persons.
- Why do you think that is?

28:18.238 --> 28:23.284
This is only my opinion, but Japanese imperial army

28:23.285 --> 28:26.120
did a lot of brutal stuff on this island

28:26.121 --> 28:29.040
and war never ended for some people.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.376
And the feelings that they got suppressed,

28:31.377 --> 28:33.919
all of a sudden, after they retired,

28:33.920 --> 28:36.797
they kind of burst and they wanted to kind of...

28:36.798 --> 28:38.633
Act out. -Act out.

28:38.634 --> 28:41.594
<i>This is Keji Yota,</i>

28:41.595 --> 28:43.179
<i>he's an Okinawan farmer,</i>

28:43.180 --> 28:45.723
<i>and this is Nishimachi,</i>

28:45.724 --> 28:48.685
<i>a small noodle shop that
bears only the owner's name</i>

28:48.686 --> 28:51.938
<i>and serves only Okinawan-style soba.</i>

28:53.148 --> 28:56.067
<i>Pork belly or ribs is the meat.</i>

28:56.068 --> 28:58.695
<i>The broth a mix of fish, chicken, pork,</i>

28:58.696 --> 29:01.113
<i>and vegetable stocks.</i>

29:01.114 --> 29:03.199
<i>Okinawan soba differs greatly</i>

29:03.200 --> 29:05.451
<i>from what we know from the mainland.</i>

29:05.452 --> 29:07.953
<i>They use wheat noodles instead of buckwheat,</i>

29:07.954 --> 29:11.332
<i>a nod perhaps to the spaghetti
eating Marines they lived with</i>

29:11.333 --> 29:13.000
<i>all these years.</i>

29:13.001 --> 29:15.461
<i>Garnishes are spring onion, fish cake</i>

29:15.462 --> 29:18.214
<i>and slices of omelet. Add your pickled ginger,</i>

29:18.215 --> 29:22.176
<i>and togarashi hot sauce, and hoo-rah.</i>

29:22.177 --> 29:26.514
It seems the anti-base sentiment also coincides

29:26.515 --> 29:29.183
with an anti-central government sentiment.

29:29.184 --> 29:32.061
You do bear a hugely disproportionate

29:32.062 --> 29:36.023
burden of bases. Isn't some
activism called for here?

29:36.024 --> 29:40.612
I think the young generation
should decide what to do

29:40.613 --> 29:43.864
for our future instead of the
old people just fighting

29:43.865 --> 29:46.825

29:46.826 --> 29:51.997
To me, I really feel a strong need to forgive.

29:51.998 --> 29:54.876
Mm-hm. -And then forget.

29:57.421 --> 30:00.881
<i>Long before the war, the Americans arrived.</i>

30:00.882 --> 30:03.760
<i>Long before the Satsuma invaded from the mainland,</i>

30:03.761 --> 30:07.513
<i>Okinawa was a kingdom. The Ryukyu Kingdom.</i>

30:07.514 --> 30:10.642
<i>A prosperous and peaceful island chain</i>

30:10.643 --> 30:12.351
<i>with no standing army.</i>

30:12.352 --> 30:16.855
<i>They were farmers, traders,
and necessarily diplomats</i>

30:16.856 --> 30:20.610
<i>whose eyes, more often than
not, looked west to China</i>

30:20.611 --> 30:23.862
<i>rather than to the more isolated mainland.</i>

30:23.863 --> 30:26.574
<i>While Japan as it existed then was isolationist,</i>

30:26.575 --> 30:28.701
<i>racially and ethnically, culturally,</i>

30:28.702 --> 30:32.455
<i>and in every other way, the Ryukyu Kingdom</i> was not.

30:32.456 --> 30:36.250
<i>They were more open, more multicultural,</i>

30:36.251 --> 30:40.087
<i>more used to and predisposed to
dealing with the outside world</i>

30:40.088 --> 30:42.633
<i>and its influences.</i>

30:44.343 --> 30:46.803

<i>Kumejima is a small island that
has been largely untouched</i>

<i>by the changes in the world.</i>

30:57.481 --> 31:03.486
<i>People farm and fish as they always did.</i>

31:03.487 --> 31:07.990

<i>This is Bunshiro Nagame and Yohina Tomohiro,</i>

31:11.537 --> 31:14.913

31:14.914 --> 31:18.167

31:18.168 --> 31:22.673
And no military bases. No American presence.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.471

31:30.472 --> 31:33.432
There was. -

31:33.433 --> 31:37.687

Tourism. Fishing. -Fishing.

develop here and have the locals

31:58.333 --> 32:00.586
