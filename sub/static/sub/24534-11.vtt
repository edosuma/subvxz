00:05.880 --> 00:07.370
Alicia!

00:08.590 --> 00:09.830
Alicia!

00:58.010 --> 00:59.341
Hey!

04:15.210 --> 04:16.586
Mississippi?

04:33.310 --> 04:34.470
Hello?

04:47.200 --> 04:48.360
Hello?

04:57.670 --> 04:58.989
Anybody here?

05:50.720 --> 05:52.460
Is that you, Polar Bear?

05:52.770 --> 05:54.806
Do you copy? Over.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.641
Do you copy? Over.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.157
Erm...

06:11.490 --> 06:12.696
Hello.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.399
Who Is this?

06:18.960 --> 06:20.700
Er, my name...

06:22.630 --> 06:27.658
I think I, er, hitched a ride
accidentally in the back of a semi.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.887
I somehow found myself at this...

06:31.300 --> 06:32.506
This truck stop.

06:33.430 --> 06:34.670
Which one?

06:36.560 --> 06:38.596
Er, which one what?

06:38.690 --> 06:39.839
Which location?

06:43.440 --> 06:45.021
Think it's Mississippi.

06:46.570 --> 06:48.731
Sweet syrup on a shortstac/g that’s...

06:49.450 --> 06:51.406
Thatis farther than I thought

06:51.700 --> 06:53.907
Make yourself at home.
You know what we say.

06:53.990 --> 06:55.946
Take what you neeo; leave what you don’t.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.496
Hey, who are you?

06:58.580 --> 07:00.286
And what is this place?

07:02.670 --> 07:04.035
Hello?

07:05.460 --> 07:06.870
Hello? Hey!

09:23.390 --> 09:24.766
I'm not armed.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.509
Get out.

09:29.310 --> 09:32.985
Er, you give me a minute?

09:38.490 --> 09:39.730
Thank you.

09:51.170 --> 09:52.296
All my life,

09:53.170 --> 09:54.501
people like you

09:55.090 --> 09:57.627
been usin' stalls made for people like me.

09:58.590 --> 10:00.342
I never ask the question,

10:01.260 --> 10:04.388
but I'ma ask it now. Why?

10:05.560 --> 10:06.766
I'm...

10:09.520 --> 10:11.010
I'm gonna be honest.

10:12.940 --> 10:15.147
It always seemed like a little apartment.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.691
It is.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.191
Especially when it has a sink.

10:20.070 --> 10:22.652
I guess everybody likes it
when it feels a little homey.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.940
I accept the
exp/anao’o.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.866
Now, what's in this bag?

10:32.710 --> 10:34.291
Somebody told you
you could take all of this?

10:34.380 --> 10:36.792
Yeah, somebody did. A woman.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.290
Whoever I talked to on the radio.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.596
You talked to somebody on the radio?

10:42.680 --> 10:44.386
I talked to somebody on the radio.

10:44.470 --> 10:46.301
You talked to somebody on the radio?

10:46.390 --> 10:48.722
Yes, I talked to somebody on the radio.

10:48.810 --> 10:51.142
- You talked--
- Can you lower that, please?

10:51.230 --> 10:52.299
Sure can.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.140
That voice, it said,

10:58.240 --> 11:00.196
"Take what you need,
leave what you don't."

11:01.620 --> 11:03.656
I thought that's what
all this was here for.

11:03.740 --> 11:04.786
It is.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.498
Stevie forget to tell us
she talked to one of our visitors?

11:11.330 --> 11:14.788
You'll have to excuse my brother.
He's a little jumpy.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.449
Brother?

11:18.510 --> 11:19.579
We're twins.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.716
What exactly is it you do here?

11:26.520 --> 11:29.728
We pack 'em. We drive 'em. We deliver 'em.

11:30.350 --> 11:34.389
When the world went dingo scat,
we just kept on doing what we always did.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.937
Knew where the warehouses
full of supplies were.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.488
Knew roads other people didn't,
where to find diesel.

11:40.570 --> 11:44.449
We've been livin' on the fringes.
Fringes are all that's left.

11:45.620 --> 11:49.249
When the road get bumpy,
you keep on movin' ahead in your truck.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.740
It's "keep on truckin'."

11:51.830 --> 11:53.320
Keep on truckin'.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.705
Man, you mind lowering that now?

11:56.800 --> 11:58.290
Ain't gonna happen.

11:58.380 --> 12:01.042
Wendell, lower the damn gun. Come on.

12:04.470 --> 12:06.711
And your power, your water?

12:06.970 --> 12:09.097
Solar panel, water pump, and cistern.

12:09.180 --> 12:12.479
Hey, we have satellite TV
if anybody was still broadcasting.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.357
There more?

12:18.110 --> 12:20.237
More of you, places like this?

12:26.450 --> 12:28.111
You don't have to tell me.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.610
Not my business.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.741
How about you tell us, like,
where you headed?

12:35.040 --> 12:37.531
So we can get you kitted out
and on your way.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.456
Heading back, erm...

12:41.920 --> 12:43.376
Back east.

12:45.090 --> 12:46.421
Back east where?

12:47.680 --> 12:48.886
Virginia.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.670
Place where people
were trying to start over.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.227
Were trying to build something better.

12:56.310 --> 13:01.100
Shit! We got you 400 miles closer
and saved your ass from the hurricane.

13:01.190 --> 13:02.270
Hurricane?

13:02.610 --> 13:04.066
Worst I've ever seen.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.777
Levees broke. Roads washed out.

13:08.070 --> 13:11.699
_ Tried six different routes
Just to get from Beaumont to Lafayette.

13:14.620 --> 13:15.780
What?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.741
I have people back there.

13:18.630 --> 13:19.745
Had.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.456
Wen.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.173
I lost Benelli. My bichon frise.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.755
I know.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.501
I'm just sayin', I know his pain.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.635
Yeah.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.347
I don't suppose I can convince you
to drive me back there.

13:35.440 --> 13:40.389
Bro. We ain't much without our truck,
and I don't think it can make it.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.180
Yeah, I understand.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.942
All the same, I'm gonna have to try.

13:49.530 --> 13:51.862
Now, there's a bridge
just north of where

13:51.950 --> 13:55.033
the Christopher Columbus
Transcontinental Highway used to run.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.951
Now, that's how we got here.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.531
If you're luclq, it's still standing.

14:01.170 --> 14:02.376
What you're doing--

14:04.340 --> 14:07.127
There ain't a whole lot of people
doing things like this these days.

14:07.470 --> 14:10.507
Hey, they looked down on us
when the soda was flowin',

14:10.850 --> 14:14.342
but we got a code,
and we keepin' it alive.

14:15.390 --> 14:16.687
And what is it?

14:19.440 --> 14:20.555
The code.

14:21.570 --> 14:26.143
You gotta help people
when they need that help.

14:27.740 --> 14:29.901
And then you gotta keep your truck movin'.

14:29.990 --> 14:32.402
- Keep on truckin'.
- Keep on truckin'.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.206
Dig it.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.536
Enjoy your trip.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.156
Well, come by and say so long.

16:42.250 --> 16:43.490
Travel safe.

16:43.580 --> 16:45.457
You could be there
for us too, right? Travel safe.

16:45.540 --> 16:46.700
So long.

17:29.540 --> 17:30.586
Sarah?

17:31.840 --> 17:33.205
Wendell, you there?

17:33.670 --> 17:34.796
Mitch, is that you?

17:34.880 --> 17:37.212
It's not Mitch, man. It's Morgan.

17:37.430 --> 17:38.590
Yeah, Morgan.

17:40.890 --> 17:42.460
You know, your maps...

17:43.220 --> 17:45.131
You really know which roads are clear?

17:45.770 --> 17:46.930
Yeah, why?

17:49.810 --> 17:52.278
The bridge, it's out.

17:53.110 --> 17:54.771
I'm just gonna come back.

17:55.860 --> 17:59.899
I thought maybe you could take me
to that place I was telling you about.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.070
What about your friends?

18:12.210 --> 18:15.122
I said the bridge is out,
and I'm coming back, okay?

18:42.700 --> 18:44.190
That's a half a point.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.535
What?

18:46.620 --> 18:48.156
You almost clipped that bird.

18:48.330 --> 18:49.456
You copy?

18:50.460 --> 18:51.666
Go for Sarah.

18:51.790 --> 18:54.839
I'm here. I'm at the truck stop.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.830
We ran into some trouble on our last stop.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.467
More dead than we thought.

18:59.880 --> 19:04.749
Meet us on 91, mile marker 64.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.260
Copy.

19:08.350 --> 19:10.898
Hey, there any other places like this
on the way east?

19:11.310 --> 19:12.891
Piss while you got a pot.

19:13.610 --> 19:17.182
That is the last outpost
on this inhospitable frontier.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.690
Ana; Mo-mo...

19:22.070 --> 19:23.310
I'm sorry.

19:23.950 --> 19:26.487
I know helping those people
meant a lot to you.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.410
Hey, hang on!

20:58.750 --> 21:00.456
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.437
How long's it take
to run across a goddamn field?

21:19.400 --> 21:20.435
Huh.

21:22.940 --> 21:24.191
I got food...

21:24.780 --> 21:27.988
Water in my car.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.650
Man, is that, erm...

21:32.410 --> 21:35.117
A particularly floral double IPA? Yeah.

21:36.210 --> 21:37.666
With hints of citrus.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.239
A-holes who tried to kidnap me,

21:40.340 --> 21:42.547
threw me into my last case
of summer stock.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.331
What happened? Who tried to kidnap you?

21:45.880 --> 21:47.040
Think I got a good look?

21:48.180 --> 21:49.420
And what did they want?

21:50.140 --> 21:51.255
Recipes.

21:51.430 --> 21:52.806
Recipes for what?

21:55.600 --> 21:56.806
Been

21:57.900 --> 21:59.549
I brew beer.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.276
Goddamn staff of life.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.876
There are people in these parts?

22:24.960 --> 22:27.963
What are you?
Part of a group or a settlement?

22:28.050 --> 22:31.178
No. Just me at my brewery.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.306
Augie's Ale.

22:33.390 --> 22:35.301
Maybe you heard of it.
We won all kinds of very important--

22:35.390 --> 22:36.596
- No.
- Awards.

22:37.940 --> 22:41.728
I grow hops
and whatever I can manage up on the roof.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.236
And who you making the beer for?

22:49.950 --> 22:52.657
You got a point to life,
or are you lookin' for one?

22:55.120 --> 22:56.781
I'm just trying to get back home.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.281
Okay. So you got something.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.918
Here's what I got, the future.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.951
We're gonna infest this planet again.
It's what we do.

23:07.050 --> 23:09.291
An ice age couldn't knock us out.

23:10.130 --> 23:14.305
You see, one day, everything that we lost,
we're gonna rebuild.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.727
We're gonna start again. It's inevitable.

23:17.810 --> 23:21.223
So, I make beer.

23:26.650 --> 23:28.311
You think I'm nuts, don't you?

23:28.570 --> 23:30.606
Actually, no.

23:31.490 --> 23:34.527
I'm going some place where
people are trying to do just that.

23:36.330 --> 23:40.243
Rebuild. I mean, not make beer.

23:40.330 --> 23:42.241
Seriously? Where?

23:42.330 --> 23:43.490
Virginia.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.547
I'm meeting up with some folks
who are gonna give me a lift.

23:49.050 --> 23:50.460
You want to come?

24:23.920 --> 24:25.581
Hey.

24:26.250 --> 24:27.490
Where are you guys?

24:28.500 --> 24:31.253
In back.
Just hitching up the gio’o’yup.

24:32.340 --> 24:33.830
What the hell, Morgan?

24:36.140 --> 24:37.255
Hey.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.346
No, I'm not gonna lower it.

24:45.100 --> 24:47.648
You found him. Thanks.

24:56.780 --> 24:59.658
This place in Virginia,
is it close to DC?

25:01.330 --> 25:03.537
Who does this truck really belong to?

25:05.080 --> 25:06.820
What happened to him?

25:07.670 --> 25:09.206
Don't worry about him.

25:09.960 --> 25:13.748
We left him by the side of the road,
somewhere in Texas.

25:14.840 --> 25:18.503
Right by one of those mile markers
where he was dropping off a box.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.342
But we wasn't assholes about it.
We left him the box.

25:21.430 --> 25:25.184
He always put 'em at a marker
that ended in four.

25:26.020 --> 25:28.978
Made it real easy to snatch his rig.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.938
You can't protect what's yours...
It ain't yours.

25:33.780 --> 25:35.099
This truck,

25:36.070 --> 25:39.983
these boxes, you could be helping people.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.902
We could. But the universe gave me
a pretty good reason not to.

25:44.370 --> 25:46.326
Those boxes are doing us a lot more good

25:46.420 --> 25:48.991
than they are
rottin' on the side of the road.

25:53.130 --> 25:55.928
This place, where is it?

25:57.890 --> 26:02.429
Hey, man, we been on the road
for a long time. Too long.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.307
The hell's this have to do with me?

26:04.430 --> 26:06.261
I like beer, Jimbo.

26:06.690 --> 26:07.725
It's Jim.

26:08.020 --> 26:10.011
- You never tried Jimbo?
- Nope.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.931
Dude, it's an awesome variant
to your name.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.179
I'd think about it.

26:14.570 --> 26:15.639
I'm set.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.106
Hey, yo, listen, man.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.613
We got the truck, we got the maps,
and we got the journal the guy kept.

26:20.990 --> 26:23.538
Now, I know you want to get there
just as much as we do.

26:23.700 --> 26:25.406
- So tell us where it is.
-Mmmmmm.

26:29.330 --> 26:31.207
Hey, yo, you know what, Sarah?

26:31.290 --> 26:33.588
- Start drivin' towards Virginia.
-Mmmmmm.

26:33.750 --> 26:36.412
He got about 1,000 miles
to change his mind.

27:09.580 --> 27:10.877
Hops, malt.

27:12.340 --> 27:13.989
Enough kettles and chillers.

27:14.420 --> 27:15.751
Yeast cake.

27:16.920 --> 27:20.799
I could make this work.
I mean, on a small scale.

27:24.390 --> 27:26.267
They didn't bring the swag.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.806
I spent a fortune on that stuff.

27:29.770 --> 27:33.479
I mean, this chick said
she was a fan of my work.

27:33.810 --> 27:36.028
Came to my brewery just to see
if there was any stock left,

27:36.110 --> 27:38.817
and finding me there was a bonus.

27:39.860 --> 27:43.193
But I can make this work.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.826
Tell them where we're going.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.029
You're not serious.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.370
I find people now?

27:53.750 --> 27:56.662
With no competition,
water sources going bad like they are?

27:56.960 --> 27:59.008
It's a better market for me now
than it ever was then.

27:59.090 --> 28:01.467
They kidnapped you. They tied you up.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.749
They tied you up.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.092
Because I was trying to stop them
from kidnapping you,

28:05.180 --> 28:06.499
and now you want to throw in with them?

28:06.600 --> 28:07.885
They're grifters.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.427
They'll get on board
once they see the profit potential.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.800
Man, you're as bad as they are.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.265
I mean, not money.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.761
Of course, not at first,
but where we're going,

28:16.860 --> 28:19.317
there's gotta be some kind of
bartering system in place.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.480
Or we can start one.

28:22.820 --> 28:25.027
I'm not taking you people
anywhere near there.

28:29.580 --> 28:31.787
Let me tell you a story, Morgan.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.623
Back when things were the way they were,

28:36.340 --> 28:40.049
I made a deal to sell
my little microbrewery

28:40.130 --> 28:43.088
to a multinational conglomerate.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.001
It took a lot of hustling to get there.

28:46.640 --> 28:50.019
Win all the right awards,
print in all the right trade mags.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.170
But it worked.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.392
I was about to cash in.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.140
I was supposed to be rich.

29:03.070 --> 29:05.982
And those dead things
stumbling around out there

29:06.070 --> 29:08.322
took that away from me, so just...

29:09.950 --> 29:11.440
Just let me get it back.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.826
Tell them where we're going.

29:19.590 --> 29:22.206
Yeah, I know. I get it.

29:22.300 --> 29:26.259
Used to be, er, commercials
during football games

29:26.340 --> 29:28.797
and buckets of suds at the local dives.

29:29.810 --> 29:32.017
But we've turned back time here, mister.

29:34.060 --> 29:37.143
History is built on beer.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.185
We are back to a time

29:41.280 --> 29:46.695
where _a safe and sterile source
of hydration and nutrItIon IS needed.

29:47.570 --> 29:50.733
Yeah. It is the staff of life.

29:51.620 --> 29:55.863
We were nomads.
Beer made us settle and become farmers.

29:55.960 --> 30:00.954
Egyptians, Sumerians,
Babylonians, Incans, the Chinese.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.837
Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer.

30:05.930 --> 30:09.047
You know people who want the world
to come back together again.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.176
They need me.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.426
They need this stuff.

30:14.060 --> 30:16.551
They need beer.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.075
We're too heaw.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.126
Start unloading.

30:50.930 --> 30:54.093
We got off easy.
At least we stayed on the road.

31:12.910 --> 31:15.902
I thought about it.
I'm not giving you the recipe.

31:16.830 --> 31:18.741
You probably wouldn't be able
to replicate it anyway.

31:18.830 --> 31:23.665
But if this place turns out to be
what he says it is,

31:24.340 --> 31:29.004
I think we can come to a, er,
mutually beneficial arrangement.

31:29.090 --> 31:33.208
Whoa, hold up. We got a lot to talk about.
You know, there's some complexity here.

31:33.300 --> 31:34.506
Do I get beer?

31:34.890 --> 31:36.300
All you can drink.

31:37.180 --> 31:38.226
Deal.

31:39.140 --> 31:40.300
Really?

31:45.940 --> 31:48.397
Oh. Yeah, hang on to that.
Those are hard to come by.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.310
Can't brew if you can't get there.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.856
Gonna have to get creative.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.479
What about you, Mo-mo?

31:57.490 --> 31:59.902
You really want to stay tied up back here?

32:05.710 --> 32:07.086
You know, the sooner that you tell us--

32:07.170 --> 32:08.831
Hey, Bear in the bushes.

32:16.720 --> 32:20.053
I don't like this.
There could be more nearby.

32:20.310 --> 32:21.595
All right, in the truck.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.140
I'm not leaving without that chiller.

32:31.490 --> 32:32.650
Morgan!

33:09.980 --> 33:11.777
Hey, can I get some help here?

33:19.450 --> 33:22.749
Man. Jimbo real/y boneo’ you.

33:23.870 --> 33:26.623
Right. So you gonna help me or what?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.547
Depends. You gonna tell us
where we ’re going?

33:39.560 --> 33:43.519
It's I-81, exit 77-C.

33:44.390 --> 33:47.052
Second road you pass,
you go along for ten miles.

33:48.110 --> 33:51.102
I'll tell you where we go from there
once you get me there.

33:53.570 --> 33:55.447
How do I know you're telling the truth?

33:56.070 --> 33:58.948
How do I know you're actually gonna
get me off of this thing?

33:59.030 --> 34:00.907
You gotta get us the whole way.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.412
You go along that road
I was just telling you about

34:12.590 --> 34:15.127
till you get to a billboard for cat food.

34:16.090 --> 34:19.548
You turn left. We go about five miles,

34:20.300 --> 34:21.597
and then we're there.

34:24.810 --> 34:26.095
So?

34:31.650 --> 34:33.060
Who's going first?

34:35.900 --> 34:38.983
I've been living in a brewery
since this whole thing started.

34:39.070 --> 34:41.322
I haven't been out until now. I mean, I...

34:41.410 --> 34:43.116
I don't do this kind of thing.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.498
Huh. Me neither.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.370
Sorry, Morgan.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.548
You made it this long without us.
I think you got this.

34:54.420 --> 34:55.626
Hey.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.587
Hey, you can't just turn around
and walk away!

35:01.220 --> 35:02.596
Sure, we can. You did.

35:03.010 --> 35:04.420
What are you talking about?

35:08.310 --> 35:09.516
The bridge.

35:11.190 --> 35:12.600
We knew it wasn ’t out.

35:13.730 --> 35:16.358
You said you were going to
help your friends, but...

35:17.190 --> 35:20.239
Guess we're not the only ones
pretending to be something we're not.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.480
Hey!

35:29.620 --> 35:30.700
Hey!

36:16.460 --> 36:18.291
You don't have to do this.

36:22.630 --> 36:24.291
You can come back.

36:32.060 --> 36:33.846
I know you can hear me.

36:37.730 --> 36:39.641
You know what? I'm just gonna say it.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.236
I could've crossed that bridge.

36:47.870 --> 36:51.613
Could be on my way back to Texas
right about now, but I'm not.

36:55.250 --> 36:57.377
Had a little bit of time
to think about it here and...

37:06.010 --> 37:07.591
I am a coward.

37:12.390 --> 37:16.599
I'd helped those people back there,
I mean, at least I thoughtI had, but...

37:21.400 --> 37:22.776
Wasn't enough.

37:23.900 --> 37:25.197
I can see that.

37:27.910 --> 37:31.539
They needed something and it was
something that I could not give them.

37:32.620 --> 37:34.201
Didn't think I could,

37:35.370 --> 37:36.997
so I got scared.

37:40.250 --> 37:43.128
Scared that if I went back,
I would just make things worse.

37:43.550 --> 37:44.790
So...

37:49.890 --> 37:51.517
Don't you come back.

37:52.140 --> 37:53.425
Not for me.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.436
I can't ask that.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.892
Maybe I can ask you to come back
just so I can do the right thing.

38:11.490 --> 38:12.570
Hello?

38:53.200 --> 38:55.691
Shit.

40:41.310 --> 40:42.766
If you're still listening,

40:44.230 --> 40:45.936
there's something I want you to know.

40:47.440 --> 40:52.275
What you said about those boxes
not doing anybody any good,

40:52.530 --> 40:54.737
just rotting in the middle of the road,

40:56.580 --> 40:58.070
you were wrong.

41:33.860 --> 41:37.023
There ’5 no exit 77-C oﬁ‘I-8J.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.881
How long it take you to figure that out?

41:59.720 --> 42:01.210
Couple hundred miles.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.720
Where's Jim?

42:04.770 --> 42:06.681
He's sleepin' one off.

42:08.270 --> 42:10.431
See? You didn't need our help.

42:11.610 --> 42:13.271
I heard you on the walkie last night.

42:14.610 --> 42:18.068
You think draggin' ass back to Texas
really gonna make a difference?

42:18.280 --> 42:20.271
I think the person
you stole that truck from

42:20.370 --> 42:23.692
didn't know if anybody would find the box
that he left on the side of the road,

42:23.790 --> 42:25.530
but he left it there anyway.

42:26.750 --> 42:28.160
Think he tried.

42:29.210 --> 42:30.837
And that's what I'm gonna do.

42:32.710 --> 42:34.291
So you two gonna let me pass?

42:36.720 --> 42:38.585
You gonna tell us the right exit?

42:41.140 --> 42:43.051
You still want to go to Virginia?

42:44.430 --> 42:46.170
Then you can be my ride,

42:46.480 --> 42:48.721
but we're gonna pick up
some other people first.

42:48.980 --> 42:51.107
Or I just continue on foot, man.

42:52.110 --> 42:53.975
And it wouldn't be the first time.

43:03.200 --> 43:06.579
You said to me that the universe gave you
a reason not to help.

43:07.330 --> 43:09.537
I think it's trying to tell you
something different now.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.376
We gonna pick up some people.

43:17.010 --> 43:18.921
And we're gonna turn around
and we're gonna take that rig

43:19.010 --> 43:20.637
straight back to Virginia.

43:22.260 --> 43:23.500
No.

43:24.890 --> 43:27.302
We gonna make some stops along the way.

43:53.040 --> 43:56.703
I don ’t know your name,
and I don ’t know where you are.

44:00.970 --> 44:02.961
I don ’t even know if you can hear me.

44:04.850 --> 44:08.092
ButI talked to one of your friends
when I was at the truck stop.

44:17.780 --> 44:20.442
Now, I ’m with some people, and...

44:22.280 --> 44:23.816
We have your truck.

44:35.340 --> 44:36.910
We ’re heading back to Texas.

44:37.840 --> 44:39.580
We ’re bn'nging it back to you.

44:43.130 --> 44:46.805
So, wherever you are, we'll keep looking.

44:48.770 --> 44:51.637
You hang on, because we're coming.

44:54.480 --> 44:56.141
We ’l/ see you on up the road.

45:06.200 --> 45:10.318
Well, Purvis, gonna be going
on the road again after all.

45:34.100 --> 45:36.261
It looks like we're going to Texas.
