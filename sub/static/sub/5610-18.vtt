You have to be willing
to play dirty.

39:19.560 --> 39:22.814
Because that, it seems, is
the only thing that works.

39:22.820 --> 39:25.027
Oh, maybe I was wrong
to say you shouldn't worry

39:25.030 --> 39:27.396
about your friend.
Hey, I never wanted
to leave Sistemics.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.891
My dad pulled me out.
You guys are my people.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.185
It's not them.

39:31.190 --> 39:32.248
Why should we believe
a word you say?

39:32.250 --> 39:34.195
Look, I can --
I can prove it.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.485
Tell me what to do.
I can prove It.
That's good.
Prove it right now.

39:35.490 --> 39:36.479
How?

39:36.490 --> 39:37.741
Hit him.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.115
What?

39:40.410 --> 39:41.627
Is he your friend or not?

39:44.210 --> 39:46.166
I don't have another heart

39:46.170 --> 39:48.161
Don't remember how to say

39:48.170 --> 39:51.958
I don't want you
to let me down sometimes

39:51.970 --> 39:53.926
I already know this part

39:53.930 --> 39:55.841
Leave it for another day
I'm not afraid.

39:55.850 --> 40:00.002
Wish it wasn't
this hard sometimes

40:00.010 --> 40:03.013
Now I don't even know
if you want to stay
[ Coughing ]

40:03.020 --> 40:05.011
There. Happy?
Oh, hit him again.

40:05.020 --> 40:07.727
[ Sighs ]
That look was on your face

40:07.730 --> 40:09.607
Now you want to save this
house

40:09.610 --> 40:11.692
Well it's far too late

40:11.700 --> 40:13.861
Oh, you want to be my healer

40:13.870 --> 40:16.191
Now that I'm up in flames
Here.
Now use this.

40:16.200 --> 40:22.799
But I was burned
before the fire

40:22.800 --> 40:24.165
I'm burned up

40:24.170 --> 40:26.536
Miranda: The FBI is still
a man's world,

40:26.540 --> 40:28.952
and in a man's world...

40:28.960 --> 40:31.929
men get away with murder.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.216
But I was burned
before the fire

40:34.220 --> 40:36.040
It's too late for me.

40:36.050 --> 40:38.427
But it's not for you.

40:38.430 --> 40:41.809
They are going to try
to hold you down.

40:41.820 --> 40:44.391
They are going to try
to hold you accountable

40:44.400 --> 40:47.551
for things
that they never would be.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.892
But I was burned
before the fire
But don't let them.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.561
You keep fighting.

40:51.570 --> 40:53.231
You do
what you have to do.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.946
Before the fire
AgaIn.

40:56.700 --> 40:59.407
[ Groans ]

40:59.410 --> 41:01.025
Again.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.376
-Again.
-Aah!

41:04.540 --> 41:07.452
Stop!
What are you doing?

41:11.250 --> 41:12.797
[ Crying ]
Oh, my God, Will!

41:12.800 --> 41:14.540
[ Sobbing ]

41:14.550 --> 41:17.383
I was burned before

41:17.390 --> 41:21.383
Raina, where are you?
I've been calling.

41:21.390 --> 41:23.551
[ Sighs ]
Caleb, he's just not --

41:23.560 --> 41:25.596
Not what?

41:25.600 --> 41:26.806
What?

41:26.810 --> 41:29.358
They don't know I'm gone,
so we got to hurry.

41:29.360 --> 41:32.238
If you're out, the only place
I'm taking you is to rehab.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.446
You need help.
Whoa, whoa, okay.

41:33.450 --> 41:35.600
You can take me to Promises
when thIs Is all over,

41:35.610 --> 41:37.487
but [sniffles ] right now,
I think you're the only one

41:37.490 --> 41:38.866
that needs help.

41:38.870 --> 41:41.156
So, where's my bag?

41:41.160 --> 41:43.537
I threw it out here somewhere --
dropped It out the WIndow.

41:43.540 --> 41:45.997
Caleb: Keep an eye out
for my mom's henchmen.
Okay.

41:47.580 --> 41:48.956
Oh, yeah.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.506
Okay.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.882
She fell for it.

41:58.890 --> 42:00.790
We're on our way now.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.347
I'll see you soon.
