00:00.710 --> 00:03.169
_

00:08.451 --> 00:09.992
Fingers on the reader.

00:11.287 --> 00:12.677
Glasses off, please.

00:20.463 --> 00:21.992
Welcome home.

00:22.799 --> 00:24.085
Ma'am...

00:25.335 --> 00:27.136
Your glasses.

00:33.376 --> 00:35.344
Citizens or permanent residents

00:35.378 --> 00:38.113
of other countries must
have a valid passport

00:38.148 --> 00:39.848
or valid visitor's visa.

00:45.822 --> 00:48.390
- Here he is.
- All right.

00:49.692 --> 00:51.693
- Good to see you.
- Oh, yeah.

00:55.698 --> 00:56.865
Hi.

01:00.270 --> 01:02.292
Hey, Rod!

01:06.376 --> 01:08.417
Ms. Wicker?

01:08.845 --> 01:10.412
Bryan Mills.

01:10.447 --> 01:12.548
I'm sorry, do we... Do
we know each other?

01:12.582 --> 01:14.650
I was told you'd be expecting me.

01:14.684 --> 01:16.373
Where's Liev?

01:16.493 --> 01:19.254
- Liev?
- Who told you I was expecting you?

01:19.289 --> 01:22.424
My boss, Christina Hart.

01:22.459 --> 01:24.493
Right.

01:24.527 --> 01:26.562
Yes, of course, please...

01:26.596 --> 01:28.002
Lead the way.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.531
- This way.
- Yeah.

01:34.437 --> 01:37.039
- Everything okay, Ms. Wicker?
- Call me Leah.

01:37.159 --> 01:38.507
Leah.

01:38.541 --> 01:40.676
And you tell me.

01:40.710 --> 01:43.679
- Tell you what?
- Is everything okay?

01:43.713 --> 01:45.481
So far, so good.

01:47.717 --> 01:50.252
- Where are we going?
- O.D.N.I.

01:50.286 --> 01:54.371
- My nephew's expecting me.
- You have a nephew here in DC?

01:54.491 --> 01:55.591
Liev.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:05.335 --> 02:07.269
Possible tourist alert.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.856
- A black Audi?
- Hopefully nothing.

02:20.402 --> 02:23.397
Okay, now we know it's not nothing.

02:23.517 --> 02:24.820
Could be her guys.

02:24.854 --> 02:27.155
Mossad? Mossad doesn't know I'm here.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.124
No one knows I'm here.

02:29.158 --> 02:30.855
Except Liev.

02:38.134 --> 02:40.936
- Clear.
- For now.

02:40.970 --> 02:42.671
And you are?

02:42.705 --> 02:43.796
Rem.

02:45.141 --> 02:46.608
And you?

02:46.642 --> 02:48.777
- John.
- Scott.

02:48.811 --> 02:52.083
Why ask O.D.N.I. for
protection instead of Mossad?

02:53.549 --> 02:55.016
Are you sure we lost them?

02:55.835 --> 02:57.819
Uh, looks like it.

02:57.854 --> 02:58.981
Why?

03:01.090 --> 03:03.458
I met Christina Hart in Beirut, '93.

03:03.493 --> 03:05.627
When she was CIA.

03:05.661 --> 03:07.896
And now it's her turn to have my back.

03:07.930 --> 03:08.997
Doing what?

03:11.234 --> 03:13.135
That's between me and her.

03:17.673 --> 03:19.875
12:00, black Audi.

03:19.909 --> 03:21.676
You two, with me.

03:21.711 --> 03:23.764
What are you doing? What are you doing?

03:25.214 --> 03:26.581
Where are they going?

03:26.616 --> 03:28.984
Sometimes, the best defense is offense.

03:32.054 --> 03:34.365
- I need a weapon.
- You're an Israeli

03:34.485 --> 03:36.337
- Intelligence Agent, right?
- A spy?

03:36.457 --> 03:38.771
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard. Who's your main focus?

03:38.795 --> 03:40.929
Who do you specialize in? ISIL?

03:40.963 --> 03:43.598
Hezbollah? Boko Haram? Who?

03:43.633 --> 03:45.734
Iran. My specialty is Iran.

03:45.768 --> 03:49.704
- Now can I have a weapon, please?
- Relax, we got ya.

03:55.878 --> 03:57.712
Empty. Car is empty.

03:59.024 --> 04:00.248
What the...

04:00.283 --> 04:02.684
Skylark is gone. Skylark is gone.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.854
Two for one! Two for one right here.

04:05.888 --> 04:07.505
Two for one!

04:44.351 --> 04:45.961
There. Sun hat.

04:45.995 --> 04:48.330
On foot, heading towards the river.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.773
Leah!

05:35.845 --> 05:38.121
- What?
- Nothing.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.355
Iranian?

05:42.475 --> 05:44.472
I don't know. Could be.

05:45.254 --> 05:47.055
I'm an Israeli Agent.

05:47.089 --> 05:50.039
- Half the world wants me dead.
- And if you hadn't just killed him,

05:50.159 --> 05:51.707
we would've had a better chance

05:51.827 --> 05:55.100
of figuring out who he is
and who the hell he works for.

06:00.336 --> 06:03.038
- Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:08.806 --> 06:10.362
There she is.

06:11.275 --> 06:14.211
- Made you a cup of tea.
- Oh, I actually brought my own.

06:14.245 --> 06:15.635
Is that okay?

06:16.481 --> 06:17.547
Yeah.

06:21.486 --> 06:23.587
- Milk? Sugar?
- Iced.

06:23.621 --> 06:25.422
I like it iced.

06:33.931 --> 06:35.198
Leah.

06:36.801 --> 06:38.301
Christina.

06:45.843 --> 06:48.065
- Eight years.
- Mm.

06:49.180 --> 06:51.715
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Mm, liar.

06:51.749 --> 06:53.617
Go grab your tea. We need to talk.

06:55.853 --> 06:59.435
So how 'bout we start
from the beginning?

07:00.658 --> 07:01.903
The beginning?

07:02.023 --> 07:04.261
When you reached out to me
the day before yesterday...

07:04.295 --> 07:06.524
From Tel Aviv, right?

07:07.331 --> 07:08.799
You said you were coming to DC,

07:08.833 --> 07:10.834
and you... you needed my help.

07:10.868 --> 07:12.333
Right...

07:13.371 --> 07:15.043
Because I'm meeting an asset

07:15.163 --> 07:17.407
from Tehran who deals only with me.

07:17.442 --> 07:19.342
No one else even knows of his existence.

07:19.377 --> 07:21.344
Not even Mossad?

07:21.379 --> 07:23.847
I made him this promise 14 years ago

07:23.881 --> 07:25.282
when I recruited him.

07:25.316 --> 07:26.583
And who called for the meeting?

07:26.617 --> 07:28.852
He did, two days ago...

07:28.886 --> 07:30.735
Highest priority.

07:32.356 --> 07:33.890
What do you need from me?

07:40.865 --> 07:42.667
Remember Beirut?

07:43.568 --> 07:47.337
Where I was your safety
net in uncertain times?

07:49.407 --> 07:52.008
Yow owe me one.

07:53.811 --> 07:55.332
And do you have any

07:55.452 --> 07:59.130
idea what your asset needs
to tell you so urgently?

08:00.229 --> 08:01.885
You think it has to do with

08:01.919 --> 08:03.553
the Prime Minister's visit to Congress?

08:03.588 --> 08:05.989
Maybe. I won't know until I see him.

08:06.023 --> 08:08.020
Do you have a place and
time set for the meeting?

08:08.140 --> 08:11.328
Mm, not yet. Step by
step is very cautious.

08:11.362 --> 08:15.031
I land, I wait, he makes
contact when he's ready.

08:15.066 --> 08:17.300
Why does Mossad think you're here?

08:17.335 --> 08:18.802
To see my nephew.

08:18.836 --> 08:20.768
- Liev.
- And his wife.

08:21.381 --> 08:22.820
He's married?

08:30.848 --> 08:33.582
Okay, I need you to stay here.

08:33.618 --> 08:36.004
- Where are you going?
- Going to find out who's

08:36.124 --> 08:39.437
trying to kill you and why. Don't
want you meeting with anyone

08:39.557 --> 08:42.058
- until I know it's safe.
- I can't not meet an Asset.

08:42.092 --> 08:45.610
You asked for my help,
and now you're gonna get it.

08:46.106 --> 08:48.064
So take a breath.

08:48.099 --> 08:49.833
Can you do that for me?

08:52.470 --> 08:53.871
Thank you.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.338
Okay.

09:01.045 --> 09:04.414
I wanna put these two
on a 24-hour watch.

09:04.448 --> 09:07.044
- Liev and Laurie Wicker.
- Protective over-watch.

09:07.164 --> 09:10.787
I'm going to go see my
counterpart in Israeli Intelligence.

09:17.829 --> 09:20.096
- Christina.
- Zev.

09:20.131 --> 09:21.698
Forgive my surprise,

09:21.732 --> 09:24.067
but a visit in person
on such short notice?

09:24.187 --> 09:27.470
And on the Eve of my Prime
Minister's arrival to the United States?

09:27.505 --> 09:30.688
- I need your help with something.
- Ah, well...

09:30.808 --> 09:32.850
He says with a sigh of relief.

09:32.970 --> 09:34.544
Of course. Please.

09:34.579 --> 09:36.479
For you, anything.

09:36.514 --> 09:37.714
Thank you.

09:40.651 --> 09:43.086
Is that tension that I sense?

09:43.120 --> 09:45.589
- In the air?
- In you.

09:45.623 --> 09:48.391
That's just the
nature of our friendship.

09:50.528 --> 09:54.397
And never drink coffee
without fine chocolate.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.000
Thank you.

09:57.034 --> 09:59.903
So how may I help?

10:01.038 --> 10:03.106
Do you know who that is?

10:08.546 --> 10:09.961
No.

10:10.081 --> 10:12.582
Well, he's taken quite a beating.

10:12.617 --> 10:13.917
Who did this?

10:13.951 --> 10:15.187
I don't know.

10:17.622 --> 10:20.690
Whoever it was knew what he was doing.

10:20.725 --> 10:22.859
- Is he Iranian?
- It's hard to say.

10:22.894 --> 10:25.629
- Where's the body?
- Federal Center morgue.

10:27.899 --> 10:29.699
Can you help me?

10:29.734 --> 10:32.068
I may know a few people.

10:57.929 --> 10:59.547
I, uh...

11:00.478 --> 11:02.378
I believe these are yours.

11:16.113 --> 11:18.515
Please don't leave me alone again.

11:18.549 --> 11:19.816
Okay.

11:28.059 --> 11:30.660
Anyone ever tell you
you have a kind face?

11:32.229 --> 11:33.496
I do?

11:37.068 --> 11:39.151
Tell me about yourself.

11:40.604 --> 11:42.672
There's not much to tell.

11:42.707 --> 11:44.574
I doubt it.

11:46.744 --> 11:48.267
Really, I'm...

11:48.497 --> 11:50.251
I'm not interesting.

11:53.217 --> 11:55.952
I'm in shock, Bryan.

11:55.987 --> 11:58.455
Are you familiar with
how to treat shock?

11:58.489 --> 12:00.223
Up to a point.

12:00.257 --> 12:03.526
Human warmth, connection.

12:08.666 --> 12:10.233
I just killed a man.

12:15.006 --> 12:16.940
You do have a kind face.

12:19.176 --> 12:21.611
Maybe you should call your nephew.

12:21.645 --> 12:23.947
- My nephew?
- Tell him you're okay.

12:32.256 --> 12:34.362
- Reza Saadon.
- Who?

12:34.482 --> 12:36.493
I need to speak to Reza Saadon.

12:38.963 --> 12:42.165
Reza Saadon is the Senior
Quds Force Agent working in DC

12:42.199 --> 12:44.067
- Spelling?
- S-A-A-D...

12:44.101 --> 12:46.002
- Got it.
- Israeli Intelligence knows of

12:46.037 --> 12:48.772
a Senior Iranian Quds Force
Operative in the United States,

12:48.806 --> 12:51.074
- and we're just finding out now?
- Please.

12:51.108 --> 12:53.843
You mean to tell me that the
U.S. doesn't have any agents

12:53.878 --> 12:56.513
operating in Israel that
we don't know about?

12:56.547 --> 12:58.181
He teaches at Mount Pleasant...

12:58.215 --> 13:00.016
- Tenured.
- Middle Eastern studies.

13:00.051 --> 13:03.153
If the Iranians targeted me,
he's the one who ordered it.

13:03.187 --> 13:06.156
We need to make sure
this is very, very quiet.

13:06.190 --> 13:09.192
This is a Senior Iranian
Quds Force Operative,

13:09.226 --> 13:11.961
which means we were never on
the Mount Pleasant campus

13:11.996 --> 13:14.164
and this never happened.

14:14.058 --> 14:15.925
Cover the stairs and the door.

15:51.155 --> 15:53.256
Step away, please.

15:53.290 --> 15:56.107
Your hands, so I can see them.

15:58.529 --> 16:00.196
I'm... I'm leaving.

16:03.534 --> 16:06.336
I don't want any trouble...

16:06.370 --> 16:08.137
Not on a college campus.

16:08.172 --> 16:09.565
Who are you?

16:14.979 --> 16:16.946
- You're making a big mistake.
- Shh.

16:16.981 --> 16:18.448
People are trying to read.

16:31.542 --> 16:32.942
Finally.

16:58.202 --> 17:01.514
It's been a long time, Reza.

17:02.276 --> 17:03.486
Why?

17:04.030 --> 17:05.554
Why did you do this?

17:12.616 --> 17:16.319
We've known each other for, what?

17:16.353 --> 17:18.354
14 years.

17:20.124 --> 17:21.890
Truly that is enough time

17:22.289 --> 17:24.394
to earn your respect.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.444
Respect?

17:39.410 --> 17:43.205
After what we have done for each other.

17:43.834 --> 17:46.459
What have you done for me?

17:47.952 --> 17:50.715
Are you okay, Leah?

17:52.223 --> 17:55.858
You disgust me.

17:58.540 --> 17:59.729
Why?

17:59.763 --> 18:01.864
What have I done?

18:01.899 --> 18:04.834
I am your asset. I contacted you.

18:04.868 --> 18:08.504
You sent a man to kill me.

18:08.539 --> 18:10.773
Did you hear what I just said?

18:10.808 --> 18:13.670
An Iranian Quds Force Operative...

18:13.790 --> 18:15.424
One of yours.

18:16.113 --> 18:18.981
I no longer work for
Iran. You know that,

18:19.101 --> 18:21.533
because you are the one that turned me

18:21.653 --> 18:25.455
14 years ago in exchange for my life.

18:25.489 --> 18:26.916
Since then,

18:27.036 --> 18:29.974
I have been working for you...

18:30.094 --> 18:31.319
For Mossad...

18:31.439 --> 18:33.220
Against Iran. I... I've lied

18:33.340 --> 18:37.114
to the Director of my ministry,
I have lied to my fellow agents,

18:37.234 --> 18:39.269
I have lied to my wife.

18:41.171 --> 18:44.941
And now you have blown my cover.

18:49.580 --> 18:50.743
Why?

18:56.920 --> 18:59.188
Because you...

19:02.626 --> 19:03.939
You...

19:04.828 --> 19:06.353
You tried to kill me.

19:09.099 --> 19:11.901
Are you sure you're okay?

19:15.506 --> 19:18.482
Leah?

19:22.846 --> 19:25.715
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

19:27.017 --> 19:29.986
Oh, my God.

19:32.389 --> 19:35.625
Alzheimer's. Early onset?

19:42.132 --> 19:45.001
They can't know... My agency.

19:45.035 --> 19:46.135
No one can.

19:46.170 --> 19:47.837
Is it possible they already do

19:47.871 --> 19:49.906
from your doctor?

19:54.678 --> 19:57.180
- If they know...
- They do.

19:57.214 --> 19:59.916
- They must.
- Then they wanna retire me.

20:02.219 --> 20:03.554
With a bullet.

20:03.674 --> 20:06.956
The things I know from all
the years of intelligence work,

20:06.990 --> 20:10.326
and now they can't take the risk

20:10.361 --> 20:13.930
of leaving me to...

20:19.069 --> 20:21.420
And they want to do it here...

20:23.073 --> 20:26.210
Of all places, now.

20:27.077 --> 20:29.803
And for it to look like an Iranian hit.

20:32.716 --> 20:34.297
I feel...

20:36.253 --> 20:37.553
I feel...

20:37.588 --> 20:38.654
Alone.

20:41.692 --> 20:44.160
So alone.

20:48.966 --> 20:52.535
I was in a car accident not long ago,

20:52.569 --> 20:56.005
where I sustained a concussion.

20:56.039 --> 20:59.572
And when I went to the doctor,
she told me that I have a...

21:00.744 --> 21:02.578
A lump in my brain.

21:02.613 --> 21:03.679
A lump?

21:07.384 --> 21:08.651
Christina...

21:10.654 --> 21:12.588
I'm sorry.

21:12.623 --> 21:14.257
It's benign.

21:14.291 --> 21:15.625
- You sure?
- No.

21:17.294 --> 21:19.429
I keep putting off the biopsy.

21:21.498 --> 21:24.934
So you're not alone, okay?

21:30.307 --> 21:31.928
I live my life

21:32.339 --> 21:34.601
on my own terms.

21:35.179 --> 21:38.714
You can be sure that
I'm gonna die on them,

21:38.749 --> 21:41.050
on my favorite beach in Roatán,

21:41.084 --> 21:42.618
with...

21:42.653 --> 21:45.621
Rosé and a good book.

22:00.704 --> 22:03.005
- I owe you an apology.
- My wife.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.674
Where are my children?

22:04.708 --> 22:07.543
They're safe. You'll be relocated.

22:10.347 --> 22:11.754
I was doing good work.

22:11.874 --> 22:13.283
- Was I not?
- Yes.

22:13.403 --> 22:16.433
Important work. And you do this to me?

22:16.553 --> 22:19.285
After I have been
nothing but loyal to you.

22:20.324 --> 22:22.225
What is going on, Leah?

22:24.228 --> 22:26.083
Give me a second.

22:27.731 --> 22:29.465
You think we should intervene?

22:29.500 --> 22:31.167
He's her asset.

22:31.201 --> 22:34.537
But she's confusing the
past with the present.

22:34.571 --> 22:36.439
That's how this disease works.

22:36.473 --> 22:39.998
It comes in unpredictable waves.
I mean, sometimes the brain is fine.

22:41.078 --> 22:43.479
Sometimes it struggles.

22:43.514 --> 22:45.448
He called her.

22:45.482 --> 22:48.632
The Israeli Prime Minister is coming to
town, and we need the intelligence

22:48.752 --> 22:51.554
he was gonna share
with her and only her.

22:51.588 --> 22:53.222
That is the priority.

22:53.257 --> 22:56.125
Before anything else,
that is the priority here.

22:58.161 --> 23:00.781
The critical intelligence
you have for me...

23:04.735 --> 23:06.536
You said it was urgent.

23:06.570 --> 23:10.706
There is an Iranian Quds
Force Cell Organization

23:10.741 --> 23:14.410
operating in a safe house in Virginia.

23:14.444 --> 23:16.679
They are waiting there for
the Prime Minister's arrival.

23:16.799 --> 23:18.314
Their plan?

23:18.348 --> 23:20.683
All I know is the location
of the safe house

23:20.717 --> 23:23.219
from where they are
going to stage their attack.

23:44.741 --> 23:46.709
Ever since I arrived,

23:46.743 --> 23:48.778
someone has been trying to kill me.

23:48.812 --> 23:51.293
The Iranians don't even know you exist.

23:53.884 --> 23:55.684
What about Mossad?

23:57.421 --> 23:59.255
Why would they want to kill you?

24:03.293 --> 24:05.227
My money's on the Iranians.

24:06.758 --> 24:08.731
You don't believe her own agency

24:08.765 --> 24:11.200
would be trying to kill her?

24:11.234 --> 24:12.401
You do?

24:17.641 --> 24:19.602
My God, you do.

24:20.344 --> 24:22.211
Right now, our job is to protect

24:22.245 --> 24:25.314
the Israel Prime Minister
from an Iranian hit.

24:25.349 --> 24:28.731
Go get the address from Leah.
Roll those guys up fast.

24:38.829 --> 24:41.757
_

24:53.635 --> 24:57.438
LR-010. Winds are 270 and 10 knots.

24:57.472 --> 24:59.673
Runway one right. You're clear to land.

25:00.954 --> 25:02.843
LR-010, copy.

25:20.896 --> 25:22.648
Narrow departure frequency.

25:22.768 --> 25:25.633
Local, channel five, log 4674.

25:25.667 --> 25:27.450
Runway one-zero.

25:47.923 --> 25:50.258
- That was quick.
- For you, anything.

25:51.359 --> 25:56.191
May... May I ask why you
wanted this so urgently?

25:56.663 --> 25:57.812
Sure.

25:59.434 --> 26:00.534
Mm.

26:11.613 --> 26:14.867
Omid Piruz, Quds Force... Iranian.

26:15.550 --> 26:17.547
Now are you going to

26:17.667 --> 26:20.406
- tell me what's going on?
- Oh, Zev, please, you know you need

26:20.526 --> 26:23.901
- to stay off the grass here.
- Well, I was just

26:24.021 --> 26:26.381
hoping to ask a favor of you

26:26.501 --> 26:27.990
in return.

26:28.609 --> 26:30.000
That sounds fair.

26:30.120 --> 26:33.217
One of my agents hasn't checked in.

26:33.471 --> 26:34.875
Leah Wicker?

26:34.995 --> 26:37.304
She passed through
your customs yesterday

26:37.339 --> 26:38.873
under a U.S. passport.

26:38.907 --> 26:41.375
A Quds Operative found
dead under a bridge,

26:41.409 --> 26:43.199
and a missing Mossad Agent.

26:44.058 --> 26:47.882
Really, you know nothing
of my missing agent?

26:49.985 --> 26:51.819
I'll keep an ear to the ground.

26:51.853 --> 26:53.387
- How 'bout that?
- Christina,

26:53.421 --> 26:55.456
we are friends. Are we not?

26:55.490 --> 26:58.435
- Good friends.
- Ah.

26:59.995 --> 27:02.296
The worst two words a man can hear

27:02.330 --> 27:04.932
from the lips of a beautiful woman.

27:04.966 --> 27:07.060
Zev, you're really too much.

27:13.942 --> 27:15.476
Shalom.

27:15.510 --> 27:16.986
Shalom.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.571
Got a 12-35, runway one
center. Line up and wait.

28:02.090 --> 28:04.838
Shh.

28:12.434 --> 28:13.901
Freeze. Don't move at all.

28:17.772 --> 28:19.917
Lights, lights.

28:22.210 --> 28:24.871
Down!

28:30.618 --> 28:34.936
You were gonna shoot down
the Israeli Prime Minister's plane...

28:35.056 --> 28:36.875
in America.

28:37.625 --> 28:39.137
Let me guess.

28:39.694 --> 28:42.571
You were gonna pin it on
a terrorist organization,

28:42.691 --> 28:44.832
which your government
would then condemn?

28:51.940 --> 28:54.190
Show this one the picture.

28:55.910 --> 28:58.045
How you doing?

28:58.079 --> 28:59.936
This is a buddy of yours?

29:05.620 --> 29:08.466
- You speak English?
- No.

29:09.301 --> 29:11.058
No, you don't speak English,

29:11.092 --> 29:12.807
or no, he's not a buddy of yours?

29:23.915 --> 29:25.271
What is this?

29:25.391 --> 29:27.941
It's when you decide
if an already crappy night

29:27.976 --> 29:29.610
can get any worse.

29:29.644 --> 29:32.479
Yes or no, do you know
the man in the picture?

29:42.090 --> 29:44.945
Zev told me he was Iranian.

29:45.612 --> 29:48.913
The Iranians we captured
swear he's Mossad.

29:49.033 --> 29:50.516
And I believe them.

29:52.953 --> 29:54.286
Are you sure?

29:54.321 --> 29:56.399
I think Zev knows you're here.

30:05.198 --> 30:08.934
Then it's time to confront this head-on.

30:10.704 --> 30:12.405
Are you ready?

30:13.180 --> 30:14.440
We don't have a choice.

30:25.852 --> 30:27.955
My brain is tired.

30:37.286 --> 30:40.697
- Everything I have...
- Don't talk like that, please.

30:40.710 --> 30:43.917
My apartment, my house in Tel Aviv,
everything goes to Liev and Laurie.

30:44.037 --> 30:46.271
And you'll tell them yourself.

30:46.306 --> 30:49.308
Do you think I'm gonna
get out of this alive?

30:49.342 --> 30:51.443
After last night, I'd
say they owe you one.

30:51.478 --> 30:53.612
Ah, Leah.

30:53.646 --> 30:55.314
"Leah."

30:55.348 --> 30:57.383
You say it like my grandmother.

30:57.417 --> 30:59.030
She was a wonderful woman.

30:59.150 --> 31:01.020
You know, I saved your life once.

31:03.323 --> 31:05.791
- Sarajevo, '94.
- That was you?

31:06.760 --> 31:08.227
And for your information,

31:08.261 --> 31:10.496
I just saved our Prime Minister's life.

31:11.931 --> 31:13.665
So what happened to a gold watch

31:13.700 --> 31:15.968
and a condo on the Mediterranean?

31:21.708 --> 31:24.552
I just want to ask you one question.

31:25.445 --> 31:29.381
Was it you who gave the
order to have me killed?

31:29.416 --> 31:31.750
Or was it an agency directive?

31:31.785 --> 31:33.541
Leah, please.

31:39.327 --> 31:41.081
Are you acting alone?

31:45.632 --> 31:46.899
Yeah...

31:49.369 --> 31:51.003
You are acting alone.

31:51.037 --> 31:53.705
Good, that's all I need to know.

32:02.449 --> 32:05.265
Skylark is flying.

32:14.961 --> 32:16.361
Go!

32:22.001 --> 32:24.470
I need to get to my nephew's
apartment in McLean.

32:24.504 --> 32:26.805
I have a go-bag and a car there.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.127
Out the back.

33:25.165 --> 33:26.951
Get out of here.

33:32.972 --> 33:34.673
Car keys.

33:43.082 --> 33:45.450
Ah!

33:54.761 --> 33:56.061
No!

33:56.095 --> 33:58.199
They're Israeli Agents. No kill shots.

34:23.458 --> 34:25.433
A motorist crashed into a gas main

34:25.553 --> 34:27.920
Outside of an Adams-Morgan
apartment building yesterday,

34:27.955 --> 34:29.656
causing an explosion

34:29.690 --> 34:32.692
and forcing the
evacuation of two buildings.

34:32.726 --> 34:35.262
There is one fatality,
the driver of the car,

34:35.295 --> 34:38.039
and we are waiting...

34:38.900 --> 34:41.368
They'll ID her body
within the next few hours.

34:47.574 --> 34:50.543
I'm just glad you all got to know her

34:50.578 --> 34:52.478
even a little bit.

35:05.743 --> 35:08.126
From a little
shop on J Street.

35:09.396 --> 35:11.531
I'm sorry for your loss, Christina.

35:11.566 --> 35:13.266
Mm, our loss.

35:13.386 --> 35:15.395
Yes, yours and mine,

35:16.404 --> 35:18.684
America and Israel.

35:19.507 --> 35:21.240
Iran's gain.

35:21.676 --> 35:23.018
Iran.

35:24.479 --> 35:28.115
She was a most painful
thorn in their side.

35:28.149 --> 35:30.591
- Legendary, I'm told.
- Yeah. Yes.

35:31.552 --> 35:34.488
But at least she is at peace now.

35:36.724 --> 35:40.060
And here you are with more chocolates.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.395
Life must go on.

35:41.429 --> 35:43.383
Leah would've wanted that.

35:44.899 --> 35:47.557
And for our friendship to continue.

35:48.186 --> 35:50.037
In her memory.

35:50.568 --> 35:52.068
Mm.

35:52.963 --> 35:56.713
Do you really believe the
Iranians planted that bomb?

35:58.056 --> 35:59.677
You don't?

36:07.455 --> 36:08.555
Enjoy.

36:17.398 --> 36:19.433
Bittersweet.

36:29.644 --> 36:31.025
You got a minute?

36:32.198 --> 36:33.432
Sure.

36:41.889 --> 36:44.191
What is it, Bryan?

36:48.763 --> 36:50.636
I guess I'm... I'm...

36:51.899 --> 36:53.850
I'm a little worried about you.

36:55.503 --> 36:57.871
Mossad found out about Leah's diagnosis

36:57.905 --> 36:59.806
from her medical records.

36:59.841 --> 37:02.576
I went to the doctor under a fake name.

37:02.610 --> 37:05.810
No one needed to know
about my concussion.

37:05.930 --> 37:09.249
Thank you, but it's really
nothing to be concerned about.

37:09.283 --> 37:12.137
Well, I think I'd be a bit concerned
about a tumor in my head.

37:12.257 --> 37:14.554
No one else knows about
my diagnosis but you.

37:14.589 --> 37:17.691
Is that something I should
be concerned about?

37:22.405 --> 37:23.760
No.

37:24.999 --> 37:26.233
We're good.

37:28.536 --> 37:29.736
Good.

37:47.889 --> 37:49.623
- Hey.
- Hey, Harry.

37:49.657 --> 37:51.577
It's, what? 3:00 a.m.?

37:51.697 --> 37:53.593
I tried calling your phone, but, uh...

37:53.628 --> 37:56.263
Oh, I must've left it
on "do not disturb."

37:56.297 --> 37:58.567
Were you busy writing?

37:59.901 --> 38:02.369
No, I was busy sleeping.

38:02.403 --> 38:03.603
Oh.

38:05.306 --> 38:07.808
- Anyway...
- Take your coat?

38:09.644 --> 38:11.451
I like your face.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.125
Okay.

38:14.982 --> 38:16.983
Do you have a problem with that?

38:21.109 --> 38:24.193
Did you come here at 3:00
in the morning to tell me that?

38:33.401 --> 38:36.111
I lost someone today.

38:37.271 --> 38:38.472
What?

38:51.052 --> 38:52.873
You're freezing.

38:53.788 --> 38:56.104
Come on. Come sit down.

39:00.628 --> 39:03.550
But it made me start to think, you know.

39:03.670 --> 39:05.699
She was all alone...

39:05.733 --> 39:08.171
Just this life of service and secrets...

39:08.291 --> 39:12.572
And I suddenly realized
that that could be me

39:12.607 --> 39:14.774
one day, you know,

39:14.809 --> 39:16.910
in the not-too-distant future.

39:16.944 --> 39:18.345
Christina...

39:18.379 --> 39:21.047
Unless I do something about it.

39:27.822 --> 39:30.357
Are you open to ideas?

39:30.391 --> 39:32.470
Ideas are good.

39:33.341 --> 39:35.566
3:00 in the morning?

39:37.296 --> 39:39.933
I'll take a good idea
any time of the day.

40:23.110 --> 40:24.895
How do I look?

40:30.256 --> 40:31.913
That face.

40:44.767 --> 40:46.811
Well played.

40:50.571 --> 40:52.295

41:03.084 --> 41:04.784

41:25.459 --> 41:27.358
