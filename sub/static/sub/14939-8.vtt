So exactly how much stuff
are you giving away?

01:50.624 --> 01:51.758
I don't know.

01:51.792 --> 01:53.226
Whatever you guys
don't want,

01:53.260 --> 01:54.927
we'll send 'em
to the homeless shelter.

01:54.962 --> 01:57.429
And this is part
of your therapy?

01:57.464 --> 01:58.830
Rosen's idea.

01:58.865 --> 02:00.799
I've accumulated a lot
of things throughout the years.

02:00.833 --> 02:02.333
Hmm.

02:02.368 --> 02:04.536
Pushing people?

02:04.570 --> 02:06.705
Rosen thinks surrounding
myself with ill-gotten gains

02:06.739 --> 02:08.973
keeps me hooked
into my old lifestyle,

02:09.008 --> 02:10.543
my old patterns.

02:10.578 --> 02:12.078
Does anyone have dibs
on the Blu-ray?

02:18.053 --> 02:19.353
Yeah, Patti, what's up?

02:22.124 --> 02:24.326
Yeah, okay.
Just one second.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.996
A seminar on police tactics?

02:27.030 --> 02:28.465
All my buddies
at the ATF take it.

02:28.499 --> 02:30.333
Well, this
is hostage rescuing.

02:30.368 --> 02:31.602
"Breach and clear."

02:31.636 --> 02:33.304
What the hell
is breach and clear?

02:33.338 --> 02:34.939
Well, that's my point.
I've told you a million times.

02:34.973 --> 02:36.741
- We have to be prepared.
- Yeah, first badges.

02:36.775 --> 02:38.509
Hmm?
And now this mandate?

02:38.543 --> 02:40.411
Just read the thing.
Let me know what you think.

02:40.445 --> 02:42.213
Slots are filling fast.
I need to book this.

02:42.247 --> 02:44.482
Wait, wait, Bill.
"Multiple threat assessment"?

02:44.516 --> 02:46.050
I mean, what is this?

02:46.084 --> 02:47.952
Jacketed versus
hollow point?

02:47.986 --> 02:49.453
Seriously,
can you imagine me

02:49.488 --> 02:51.956
firing an AK-47,
much less Gary?

02:51.991 --> 02:53.826
Gary's a special case, okay?
But you--

02:53.860 --> 02:55.961
I've never fired a gun
in my life.

02:55.996 --> 02:57.596
And that's
a conscious choice.

02:57.631 --> 02:59.799
It's time for you
to make some new choices.

03:08.242 --> 03:10.510
Looking for anything
in particular?

03:10.545 --> 03:12.512
Yeah, a going away present
for my kid.

03:12.547 --> 03:14.381
Tyler's leaving?

03:14.415 --> 03:16.349
Patti wants a fresh start,
so she's, uh,

03:16.384 --> 03:18.485
she's movin' back to Nevada.

03:18.519 --> 03:19.585
And she's taking Tyler with her.

03:19.620 --> 03:21.054
Ah, sorry to hear that,
Cameron.

03:21.088 --> 03:22.655
That--that's terrible.

03:22.689 --> 03:25.425
Yeah, well, when you
go into a custody hearing

03:25.459 --> 03:27.394
with a couple of DUIs,
you...

03:27.428 --> 03:28.929
don't normally win.

03:36.672 --> 03:39.974
You're not thinking of giving
your son that, are you?

03:46.482 --> 03:50.887
You know, I, uh,
I haven't really...

03:50.921 --> 03:52.755
been to too many
meetings lately.

03:55.326 --> 03:56.760
I think that's
an excellent idea.

04:13.980 --> 04:15.680
Uh, Gary,

04:15.715 --> 04:17.615
you're supposed
to take your shoes off.

04:17.649 --> 04:18.683
No, no,
I like it this way.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.983
It's all buzzy.

04:20.017 --> 04:21.952
Do you have one
where I can lie down?

04:23.088 --> 04:24.054
No.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.489
Get one.
Give it to me.

04:25.523 --> 04:27.191
Hey, do you guys know
where Hicks is?

04:27.225 --> 04:28.192
Yeah, he just left.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.693
No...No, no.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.262
I...

04:31.296 --> 04:32.329
I had it all planned out.

04:32.364 --> 04:33.564
I was gonna take Omar
from the gym,

04:33.598 --> 04:34.832
but then him
and his boyfriend

04:34.866 --> 04:36.167
decided to go
on a cruise last minute and...

04:36.201 --> 04:38.168
Hicks was my backup plan
and...

04:38.203 --> 04:39.403
and now I don't know
what to do.

04:39.437 --> 04:40.804
You should get
a foot massager.

04:40.838 --> 04:42.639
It's very therapeutic.

04:42.674 --> 04:43.974
This one has 15 settings

04:44.008 --> 04:45.942
and a shiatsu mode.

04:45.977 --> 04:48.245
I-I don't want
a foot massager, Gary.

04:48.279 --> 04:50.447
I could help if I knew
what you were talking about.

04:50.482 --> 04:53.150
My sister, she's having
her engagement party,

04:53.185 --> 04:54.952
and if I show up
without a date,

04:54.986 --> 04:56.287
my mother is gonna
auction me off.

04:56.321 --> 04:58.189
Okay, well, take Harken.

04:58.223 --> 04:59.489
Isn't he a little old?

04:59.524 --> 05:01.191
Plus, he's married.
That's just weird.

05:01.225 --> 05:02.993
So Rosen's out.

05:03.027 --> 05:04.528
Isn't there someone
you can push?

05:04.562 --> 05:06.464
I mean, the express mail guy's
gonna be here

05:06.498 --> 05:07.598
in 15 minutes.

05:07.632 --> 05:10.501
Look, Nina,
if I don't find a date,

05:10.535 --> 05:11.735
I'm gonna spend
the rest of the year

05:11.770 --> 05:13.137
going on blind dates
with third cousins.

05:14.740 --> 05:17.141
My feet are so happy.

05:21.246 --> 05:24.147
It's just desperate.

05:24.182 --> 05:26.116
Desperate times...

05:27.318 --> 05:28.284
Thanks, Margaret.

05:28.318 --> 05:30.186
That was real.

05:30.220 --> 05:31.721
Anyone else like to share?

05:36.027 --> 05:37.060
Cameron?

05:39.497 --> 05:40.731
Cameron...

05:40.765 --> 05:42.633
If I may...

05:47.373 --> 05:48.940
I'd like to say something.

05:52.412 --> 05:54.647
Yeah, go for it.

05:58.352 --> 05:59.986
My name is Jonas.

06:00.021 --> 06:02.423
- I am not an alcoholic.
- Whoa.

06:02.457 --> 06:04.291
We said at the start

06:04.325 --> 06:05.726
no sharing
unless you're one of us.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.529
I may not have experienced
your pain personally,

06:08.563 --> 06:10.931
but I can help you.

06:10.965 --> 06:12.700
How many people here
are happy?

06:12.734 --> 06:14.268
Truly happy?

06:14.303 --> 06:16.036
Look, Gil asked
you nicely.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.605
Are you happy?

06:17.639 --> 06:18.706
You don't look it.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.040
That's it.
It's time to go.

06:20.074 --> 06:22.042
I have my answer.

06:22.076 --> 06:24.210
And I have your answer.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.203
Yeah, it's pretty.
There's really good food.

07:00.204 --> 07:01.270
There's gifts.

07:01.305 --> 07:03.572
Yeah.

07:07.377 --> 07:09.712
Is that Rachel with a boy?

07:12.015 --> 07:13.682
Her poor mother.

07:13.716 --> 07:15.484
They're all
talking about us.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.452
Yeah, of course they are.
We're special.

07:17.487 --> 07:19.287
I should go
congratulate Sari,

07:19.322 --> 07:20.489
and remember,

07:20.523 --> 07:21.957
we've only been dating
for two weeks.

07:21.991 --> 07:24.326
Yeah, Rachel,
I memorized the cover story.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.128
I'm a professional
government agent.

07:26.162 --> 07:27.496
Yes, I know, Gary.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.398
Just please don't say that
to anyone else, okay?

07:29.432 --> 07:31.033
- Okay.
- Oh, and thank you.

07:31.068 --> 07:32.669
You're really helping.
Rachel!

07:32.703 --> 07:34.871
- Pa.
- I didn't think you'd come.

07:34.906 --> 07:36.907
<i>Salam.</i>

07:36.942 --> 07:38.942
I know how it is between
you and your sister.

07:38.977 --> 07:41.579
That's--that's a wool
and silk blend.

07:41.613 --> 07:43.347
- It's Italian.
- What, you know your fabrics?

07:43.382 --> 07:44.782
Your family
in the business?

07:44.816 --> 07:46.017
Heh, I like jackets.

07:46.051 --> 07:47.251
Then you should wear one.

07:49.588 --> 07:50.921
You're sick.

07:50.956 --> 07:52.923
You know, sick people
shouldn't come to parties.

07:52.958 --> 07:54.458
It's rude.

07:54.492 --> 07:55.793
Papa, are you all right?

07:55.827 --> 07:57.227
Yes, it's nothing,
Rachel.

07:57.262 --> 07:58.695
It's nothing to worry about.
It's a cough.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.301
No, there's definitely
something wrong.

08:04.335 --> 08:05.769
Oh.

08:05.803 --> 08:08.405
Please, Rachel,
not now with the smells.

08:08.439 --> 08:09.973
No...that's her ability.

08:10.008 --> 08:11.642
That's what makes her special.
Gary...

08:11.677 --> 08:13.011
- Her synesthesia.
- Gary, stop.

08:13.045 --> 08:14.479
I'm glad
I don't have it, though.

08:14.514 --> 08:15.480
I don't--
I don't like smells.

08:15.515 --> 08:16.515
Gary, you're not helping.

08:16.549 --> 08:18.183
What is it?
Is something wrong?

08:18.218 --> 08:19.751
Look...I'm sorry, mom.

08:19.786 --> 08:22.020
I don't mean to upset
anybody, it's just...

08:22.055 --> 08:24.523
Papa, you need
to go to the doctor.

08:24.557 --> 08:25.724
Right away.

08:25.758 --> 08:28.193
Enough.
Not here, not now. Enough!

08:28.227 --> 08:30.229
- I'm not kidding!
- Enough!

08:31.498 --> 08:33.332
This is a special day
for your sister.

08:33.366 --> 08:35.267
Please, don't ruin it.

08:38.404 --> 08:40.572
Do we go back
to the office now?

08:42.674 --> 08:43.775
Yeah.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.159
Hicks, it's, like, 7:00 a.m.

09:01.194 --> 09:03.629
I know.

09:03.664 --> 09:04.864
My God, you look beautiful.

09:12.673 --> 09:14.007
Are you okay?

09:14.041 --> 09:15.508
I'm more than okay.

09:16.677 --> 09:18.645
Nina, my life...

09:18.679 --> 09:20.913
my life
finally makes sense.

09:20.948 --> 09:22.282
But you know how it is.

09:22.316 --> 09:24.951
I mean, you go along,
and things are one way and...

09:24.985 --> 09:26.352
I don't know,
you just start to think

09:26.387 --> 09:28.187
that they're always
gonna be that way, but...

09:28.222 --> 09:29.855
but then, one day,
out of nowhere,

09:29.889 --> 09:31.090
it's different.

09:32.559 --> 09:34.760
Well, you definitely
seem different.

09:34.794 --> 09:36.595
I want you to come
with me, Nina.

09:36.629 --> 09:38.096
Listen, there's something--
I wanna show you something.

09:38.130 --> 09:39.097
It is amazing.

09:39.131 --> 09:40.398
What about work?

09:40.433 --> 09:41.566
We can be late
for one day.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.601
Come on.

09:43.636 --> 09:44.836
Do this for me.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.674
Okay.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.009
Okay.

10:02.491 --> 10:04.725
So what is it
you want to show me?

10:04.760 --> 10:06.660
Not that I don't
enjoy the tour.

10:06.695 --> 10:08.195
I want you to meet
my friend Jonas.

10:08.230 --> 10:10.298
They said
he'll be out soon.

10:10.332 --> 10:12.033
He's preparing to speak
at a big gathering this weekend.

10:12.067 --> 10:13.968
There's gonna be
thousands of people.

10:14.002 --> 10:15.202
Sounds like a big shot.

10:15.236 --> 10:16.504
I'm telling you, Nina,

10:16.538 --> 10:17.905
there's something
about this guy.

10:17.939 --> 10:19.139
Something different.

10:19.174 --> 10:21.308
Something you have
to experience for yourself.

10:21.342 --> 10:23.009
Wait, are you saying that...

10:23.044 --> 10:26.614
you've experienced firsthand
what this Jonas can do?

10:26.648 --> 10:29.751
Jonas can make you see things
in a new light, I promise you.

10:29.785 --> 10:31.720
These people look pushed.

10:33.690 --> 10:35.191
Is Jonas an Alpha?

10:35.225 --> 10:36.225
Nina, I'm happy.

10:36.259 --> 10:38.327
First time
I'm actually happy.

10:38.362 --> 10:40.096
I just--I want you
to be happy too.

10:40.131 --> 10:41.398
That's it.
We're out of here.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.868
Hello.
Trouble in paradise?

10:43.902 --> 10:45.603
Jonas,
this is my friend Nina

10:45.637 --> 10:46.837
I was telling you about.

10:46.872 --> 10:48.305
And I'm...afraid
she's not sure

10:48.340 --> 10:49.740
if she wants to be here.

10:49.774 --> 10:50.941
I know I don't.

10:50.975 --> 10:52.376
How can you know anything?

10:52.410 --> 10:54.878
You've only just arrived.

10:54.913 --> 10:57.748
You're gonna tell me
what's going on here.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.750
What you're doing
to all these people.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.753
Cameron told me about you.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.388
The wonderful things
you can do.

11:03.422 --> 11:04.889
It's not working.

11:06.392 --> 11:07.525
Cameron...

11:07.559 --> 11:09.060
- Trust me, Nina.
- Get us out of here.

11:09.094 --> 11:10.428
You're gonna thank me.

11:26.648 --> 11:29.149
Rachel, did you get me
the hummus?

11:29.183 --> 11:31.651
You promised me
the leftover hummus.

11:31.685 --> 11:32.818
Bottom shelf, Gary.

11:32.853 --> 11:34.453
Oh, ah.

11:34.488 --> 11:35.554
I like hummus.

11:35.588 --> 11:37.623
'Cause it's all one color,

11:37.657 --> 11:38.790
and it's soft.

11:40.693 --> 11:42.694
Is your father
at the hospital?

11:42.728 --> 11:44.129
Did you get
the test results?

11:44.163 --> 11:45.831
He didn't go.

11:45.865 --> 11:47.166
He won't listen to me.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.567
No, but he has
to listen to you.

11:48.602 --> 11:50.770
Otherwise--otherwise,
he'll just get sicker.

11:50.805 --> 11:52.639
And then--and if you
get too sick,

11:52.673 --> 11:53.974
then you die,
and then it's too late.

11:54.008 --> 11:55.643
Gary, I can't talk
about this with you, okay?

11:55.677 --> 11:56.944
No, but you have
to talk to me,

11:56.979 --> 11:58.980
because I'm pretending
to be your boyfriend.

11:59.014 --> 12:00.615
I don't think
you'd understand, Gary.

12:00.650 --> 12:03.919
- My family--
- No, I--you don't understand.

12:03.953 --> 12:05.987
Rachel, uh...

12:06.022 --> 12:08.524
I always say
what's on my mind.

12:08.558 --> 12:10.859
And you should
learn from me.

12:10.893 --> 12:12.293
Yeah.

12:12.328 --> 12:15.029
You have to go, and you have
to tell your father the truth.

12:15.064 --> 12:17.098
And then you have
to keep telling him.

12:17.132 --> 12:18.967
You have to keep telling him
the truth

12:19.001 --> 12:20.702
until he pays attention.

12:20.736 --> 12:22.403
Just like I do with Bill.

12:22.438 --> 12:25.139
Or like this, like
I'm doing it with you now.

12:25.173 --> 12:27.074
Rachel, come on.
You gotta--

12:27.108 --> 12:28.708
you gotta go
and you gotta tell him.

12:28.743 --> 12:31.411
And I won't stop talking to you
until you do go.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.513
Okay?

12:33.547 --> 12:34.748
Okay, Gary.

12:34.782 --> 12:35.882
Okay.

12:41.756 --> 12:43.891
I'm looking out for you.

14:45.387 --> 14:46.454
What happened to him?

14:46.488 --> 14:48.089
Nothing to alarm here.

14:48.123 --> 14:50.058
Everyone back to work.

14:50.092 --> 14:51.760
He looks sick.

14:51.961 --> 14:54.563
Sometimes the darkness
overwhelms my followers.

14:54.598 --> 14:55.979
I think he needs a doctor.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.114
A doctor
wouldn't understand

14:57.148 --> 14:58.482
what we're trying
to accomplish here

14:58.516 --> 14:59.917
or what's
attacking this man.

14:59.951 --> 15:02.118
Our boss, Dr. Rosen,
he understands us.

15:02.153 --> 15:03.687
He'd understand you.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.467
Hello.

15:54.502 --> 15:56.503
Are you here
to see father?

15:56.537 --> 15:58.137
Well, that depends.

15:58.172 --> 16:00.173
Uh, who is your father?

16:00.207 --> 16:03.609
Jonas.
He's everyone's father.

16:03.644 --> 16:05.578
Daddy used to be my father,

16:05.613 --> 16:08.649
but they had to burn daddy up
when he got sick.

16:08.683 --> 16:10.918
We practice cremation.

16:10.952 --> 16:13.821
Environmentally, it's
more responsible than burial.

16:13.856 --> 16:15.556
Father, I want
to see the lights!

16:15.591 --> 16:17.058
Can I see the lights?

16:17.093 --> 16:18.861
Not now, Teddy.
Go find your friends, okay?

16:21.064 --> 16:22.464
You must be Jonas.

16:22.499 --> 16:23.932
Dr. Rosen, I hope
you're as competent

16:23.967 --> 16:25.234
as Nina and Cameron
say you are.

16:25.268 --> 16:27.269
I expected them
to meet me here.

16:27.304 --> 16:29.238
Uh, I should probably
speak with them.

16:29.273 --> 16:30.573
Don't you want to see
your patients first?

16:30.608 --> 16:33.043
Patients?
Um, plural?

16:33.077 --> 16:35.212
Uh, Mr. Hicks didn't go
into that much detail

16:35.246 --> 16:36.447
on his call.

16:36.481 --> 16:37.915
He just said
that I was the, uh,

16:37.950 --> 16:39.183
the only one
who could help.

16:39.217 --> 16:40.852
It's much more complicated
than that.

16:49.928 --> 16:51.161
This is it.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.712
How long has
this man been like this?

17:10.747 --> 17:13.281
A week or so.

17:13.315 --> 17:15.183
We can force him to eat
and drink a little.

17:15.217 --> 17:16.550
But eventually,
they waste away.

17:16.585 --> 17:17.984
And then others?

17:18.020 --> 17:20.055
Some longer, some less.

17:20.089 --> 17:21.455
These people need to be
in a hospital.

17:21.491 --> 17:23.791
Can't you help them?

17:23.827 --> 17:25.261
I can certainly try.
I...

17:27.130 --> 17:28.598
Oh.

17:28.632 --> 17:30.533
For starters,
this man needs IV fluids.

17:30.568 --> 17:32.302
He's extremely dehydrated.

17:32.337 --> 17:34.304
And this woman is...

17:38.143 --> 17:39.677
this woman is dead.

17:39.711 --> 17:42.213
She's been dead for hours.

17:42.247 --> 17:44.615
I've seen it so often.

17:44.649 --> 17:46.083
I try to stop it.

17:46.117 --> 17:48.285
I try to keep them safe
from the world.

17:48.319 --> 17:52.021
But...it's everywhere,
the enemy.

17:52.056 --> 17:54.323
I'm not sure I'm quite
following you.

17:54.358 --> 17:56.358
I show them the truth
behind the world.

17:56.393 --> 17:58.060
It's my gift.

17:58.094 --> 17:59.762
I let them see the light...

17:59.796 --> 18:03.133
The interconnectedness
of all things, all people.

18:03.167 --> 18:04.567
You're an Alpha.

18:04.602 --> 18:06.836
Nina and Cameron, they said
you'd understand that--

18:06.871 --> 18:09.706
Uh, yes, I have, uh,
studied people like you,

18:09.740 --> 18:12.776
uh, quite extensively.

18:12.810 --> 18:16.914
Perhaps you could describe
what exactly it is you do.

18:16.948 --> 18:18.448
Perhaps I could show you.

18:18.483 --> 18:21.685
No, I don't think that would
be a good idea right now.

18:21.719 --> 18:23.120
It'll make you happy
and content.

18:23.154 --> 18:25.223
I don't need to be happy
or content at the moment.

18:25.257 --> 18:26.557
I need to be very focused.

18:26.592 --> 18:28.159
People are very sick.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.327
You would rather
live in darkness?

18:29.362 --> 18:31.163
Uh, yes, for now.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.265
Uh...

18:33.299 --> 18:35.701
Could I see Mr. Hicks
and Ms. Theroux?

18:35.735 --> 18:38.903
I think talking to them
would be very helpful.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.507
This way.

18:48.447 --> 18:50.248
Doc.

18:50.282 --> 18:51.716
Oh, this is a bit awkward.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.185
Uh, Nina, don't get up
on my account.

18:54.219 --> 18:56.487
It's, uh--would you
excuse us for a moment, please?

18:56.521 --> 18:57.487
Don't take too long.

18:57.522 --> 18:59.089
Those people downstairs
need you.

19:03.728 --> 19:05.296
Uh, this might be
stating the obvious,

19:05.330 --> 19:07.766
but this man has used
his Alpha ability on you.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.902
Jonas doesn't call it
an ability.

19:09.936 --> 19:12.838
He says it's a divine gift.

19:12.873 --> 19:15.041
There's this light,
this light of the world,

19:15.075 --> 19:17.243
and it's in all of us.

19:17.278 --> 19:20.045
It connects us.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.781
Look, Doc, I know it's hard
to understand that it's there,

19:22.816 --> 19:24.250
but once Jonas
explains it to you,

19:24.284 --> 19:25.517
you'll see it.

19:25.552 --> 19:26.718
Everything just makes sense.

19:26.752 --> 19:29.054
This might seem all
quite miraculous to you,

19:29.088 --> 19:30.421
but what
you're experiencing

19:30.456 --> 19:31.856
has nothing to do
with the divine.

19:31.890 --> 19:33.091
This is a result
of his ability.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.425
His Alpha ability.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.260
You should let him
show you.

19:36.295 --> 19:39.965
Uh...well,
maybe I will, Nina.

19:39.999 --> 19:42.601
Um, but, uh...

19:42.635 --> 19:43.602
not right now.

19:43.637 --> 19:44.737
Uh, right now,

19:44.772 --> 19:46.239
I need you
to put on some clothes,

19:46.273 --> 19:47.841
and come back
to the office with me.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.276
Clearly, we have
a lot to discuss.

19:49.310 --> 19:51.144
But I don't want
to do it here.

19:51.179 --> 19:52.446
I don't get it.

19:52.480 --> 19:53.781
I mean, I thought this
is what you wanted for us--

19:53.815 --> 19:55.116
for us to find peace.

19:55.150 --> 19:58.019
You should be happy
for us.

19:58.053 --> 20:00.121
I am...believe me.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.722
But we should go.

20:14.134 --> 20:18.136
Cell phones
are a distraction.

20:18.171 --> 20:19.604
Part of the white noise
of the world

20:19.639 --> 20:21.774
that keeps us from
truly knowing each other.

20:21.808 --> 20:23.008
I see.

20:23.042 --> 20:25.711
Have you blocked
the signal somehow or--

20:25.745 --> 20:28.180
We disabled
the only tower for miles.

20:28.214 --> 20:29.514
The patients are waiting.

20:37.990 --> 20:40.224
Heh. You're curing them.

20:40.259 --> 20:41.992
Uh, diagnosing them.

20:42.027 --> 20:45.663
I-I believe these people
are suffering

20:45.697 --> 20:49.600
from a form of
encephalitis lethargica.

20:49.634 --> 20:53.637
It's a condition
which attacks the brain

20:53.671 --> 20:56.373
and leaves the individual
speechless and, well,

20:56.407 --> 20:57.440
emotionless.

20:57.475 --> 20:58.742
Let me ask you something.

20:58.776 --> 21:01.277
When you share your ability
with these people,

21:01.312 --> 21:03.046
they see things, right?

21:03.081 --> 21:06.517
Light and, uh,
angels that they draw?

21:06.551 --> 21:09.321
They perceive
the luminous.

21:09.355 --> 21:12.024
There's a neurological
explanation for all of this.

21:12.058 --> 21:15.361
Are you familiar
with the pineal gland?

21:15.395 --> 21:18.298
Overstimulation can induce
hallucinations,

21:18.332 --> 21:19.966
brilliant visions,
and often,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.335
an overwhelming sense
of well being.

21:22.370 --> 21:25.038
You think you can
quantify everything.

21:25.072 --> 21:27.374
Put it into a little box.

21:27.408 --> 21:29.910
If you'd just let me show you,
you'd see.

21:29.944 --> 21:32.279
Well, you run the risk
of turning your doctor

21:32.313 --> 21:33.680
into another patient.

21:33.714 --> 21:36.983
Th-there is, however,
a medication

21:37.017 --> 21:39.118
which could help--
L-Dopa.

21:39.152 --> 21:42.455
I can run out right now
and bring some right back.

21:42.489 --> 21:44.257
I'll send someone.
How much do you need?

21:44.291 --> 21:46.292
Well, they'll only
give it to a doctor.

21:46.326 --> 21:48.328
So write a prescription.

21:57.304 --> 21:59.005
Last drop-off is 10:00 p.m.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.707
Pop!

22:00.741 --> 22:02.175
Rachel!

22:05.413 --> 22:07.247
It's late, don't you have work
in the morning?

22:07.281 --> 22:10.183
Yeah. Look...

22:10.217 --> 22:12.451
Back home in Tehran,
when you were a doctor...

22:12.486 --> 22:14.086
what would you do
if a patient

22:14.121 --> 22:15.688
wouldn't listen
to your recommendation?

22:15.722 --> 22:16.989
But you're not a doctor.

22:17.024 --> 22:19.158
And I haven't been one
for a very long time.

22:19.192 --> 22:21.227
Papa, you're sick.

22:21.261 --> 22:22.429
And you need to get help.

22:22.463 --> 22:24.430
Rachel...

22:24.464 --> 22:25.531
I'm tired.

22:25.565 --> 22:27.166
I want my dinner.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.567
Hey. Hey.

22:28.601 --> 22:30.002
Listen to me.

22:30.036 --> 22:31.837
When Sari and Darius
and I were little

22:31.871 --> 22:33.238
and we got sick,

22:33.272 --> 22:35.340
you brought us
our medicine.

22:35.375 --> 22:36.575
You made sure
we got our sleep.

22:36.609 --> 22:37.576
You never left our side.

22:37.610 --> 22:38.577
You're my children.

22:38.611 --> 22:40.712
And you're my papa.

22:40.746 --> 22:42.914
And, papa, you have cancer.

22:42.948 --> 22:44.449
In your throat.

22:44.483 --> 22:46.351
And if you don't do something
about it soon,

22:46.385 --> 22:48.753
you will die.

22:48.788 --> 22:50.455
You will not see
your grandchildren.

22:50.489 --> 22:53.425
You will not
walk me down the aisle.

22:53.460 --> 22:54.760
You'll be gone.

22:54.795 --> 22:56.929
All because
you were too stubborn

22:56.964 --> 22:58.831
to listen
to your loved ones.

23:01.035 --> 23:02.435
- I--
- Now...

23:02.469 --> 23:03.803
are you gonna
go to the doctor?

23:03.837 --> 23:05.238
Or do I have
to talk to mom?

23:08.642 --> 23:13.145
You were such a quiet,
obedient child.

23:13.179 --> 23:16.615
I'm not a child anymore.

23:16.649 --> 23:19.350
Tomorrow, okay?

23:19.385 --> 23:21.152
Or I'm coming back.

23:34.168 --> 23:35.302
Oh, no!

23:41.742 --> 23:43.209
Shoot.

23:47.014 --> 23:49.082
Dr. Rosen...

23:49.116 --> 23:51.117
Jonas is looking for you.

23:56.523 --> 23:58.857
Maria Parsonetti
came to us

23:58.892 --> 24:00.225
a drug-addicted runaway.

24:00.260 --> 24:02.194
She ascends now.

24:02.228 --> 24:05.398
May her soul be blessed as
it returns to the great light.

24:05.432 --> 24:06.866
And together, we say...

24:06.900 --> 24:08.101
Amen.

24:12.239 --> 24:15.174
That woman didn't
have to die.

24:15.209 --> 24:17.010
And you're going to have to burn
a lot more bodies

24:17.044 --> 24:18.645
before this is done.

24:18.679 --> 24:22.115
This is how
it's always been.

24:22.149 --> 24:24.784
If these people's lives
mean anything to you,

24:24.818 --> 24:26.719
make sure it
ends differently this time.

24:36.591 --> 24:38.591
Pop, I'm so glad.

24:38.954 --> 24:40.716
You let me know as soon
as you get the test results.

24:40.717 --> 24:42.618
Promise?

24:42.652 --> 24:44.553
Pop, I don't need
to be protected,

24:44.587 --> 24:46.422
I need the truth.

24:46.456 --> 24:47.590
Okay.

24:47.624 --> 24:49.592
Did you ask if there's
any more hummus?

24:49.626 --> 24:51.361
I really like the hummus.

24:51.395 --> 24:52.461
Gary, I will get my mom

24:52.496 --> 24:53.696
to make you as much hummus
as you want.

24:53.730 --> 24:55.432
Guys, guys, guys.
Where is everybody?

24:55.466 --> 24:57.767
I'm calling--phones,
texting--no one's answering.

24:57.802 --> 24:59.937
Dr. Rosen never turned up
to drive me.

24:59.971 --> 25:01.305
He didn't pick you up
this morning?

25:01.339 --> 25:02.907
No, my mom
had to drive me.

25:02.941 --> 25:05.176
And she said that I made her
late for work,

25:05.210 --> 25:06.777
but she made me
late for work too.

25:06.812 --> 25:08.579
You know, Nina didn't
come home last night.

25:08.614 --> 25:11.048
And, actually, she hasn't
returned any of my texts.

25:11.083 --> 25:13.251
I think I heard her leave
with Hicks yesterday morning.

25:13.285 --> 25:14.652
- Gary, can you please try--
- Yeah, yeah, Bill.

25:14.686 --> 25:17.121
Ping ping ping.

25:17.155 --> 25:19.657
Out of area,
out of area, out of area.

25:19.691 --> 25:20.958
What does that mean?

25:20.993 --> 25:22.059
It means out of area.

25:22.094 --> 25:23.461
It means no one's
near a tower.

25:23.495 --> 25:25.429
- What, all three of them?
- Yeah, it's weird.

25:25.464 --> 25:27.565
'Cause I can only ping them
if they're near a tower.

25:27.599 --> 25:29.600
Gary, you're gonna have
to figure out something else.

25:29.635 --> 25:31.369
I'll check
Dr. Rosen's computer.

25:31.403 --> 25:33.671
Bill, did you know
his password is...

25:33.705 --> 25:34.705
- No, I don't know...
- S-W-1...

25:34.740 --> 25:36.207
- Gary...
- M-M-3-R.

25:36.241 --> 25:39.277
It's "swimmer," but it's
numbers instead of vowels.

25:39.312 --> 25:40.813
Let's go check
the computer first.

25:40.847 --> 25:44.217
It's clever.
I set it up.

25:50.457 --> 25:52.191
That doesn't seem
to be working.

25:52.226 --> 25:54.260
Eh...

25:54.294 --> 25:55.628
I could increase the dosage,

25:55.663 --> 25:58.498
but I'm afraid
it might kill her.

25:58.532 --> 26:00.099
Maybe it's meant to be.

26:02.536 --> 26:03.569
Um...

26:04.771 --> 26:08.307
Mr. Englin, uh...

26:08.341 --> 26:11.511
you said it's always
been like this.

26:11.545 --> 26:15.248
When was the first time
this happened around you?

26:15.282 --> 26:17.450
I was very young.

26:17.485 --> 26:19.286
My father was a preacher.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.855
He was the first person
I gifted.

26:21.889 --> 26:23.857
And he realized
I'd been given...

26:23.892 --> 26:25.727
A divine calling.

26:25.761 --> 26:28.463
So he brought you
in to the family business,

26:28.497 --> 26:30.131
so to speak.

26:30.166 --> 26:31.199
I was helping people.

26:31.234 --> 26:32.334
Yeah.

26:32.368 --> 26:35.771
The entire congregation
was grateful.

26:35.805 --> 26:37.072
And then...

26:37.106 --> 26:39.508
people started
getting sick.

26:39.542 --> 26:40.909
People you'd gifted?

26:40.943 --> 26:43.412
My father said
it was the devil's work.

26:43.446 --> 26:46.115
That the darkness was trying
to steal back my gift.

26:46.149 --> 26:47.649
He prayed on it.

26:47.684 --> 26:50.986
And he saw how
to save everyone.

26:51.020 --> 26:53.789
Well, how exactly
did he do that?

26:53.823 --> 26:57.426
He purified
his congregation.

26:57.460 --> 26:59.294
With fire.

27:14.244 --> 27:17.046
It's--it's working.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.915
Here, take some more.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.454
Did I do anything stupid?

27:24.488 --> 27:27.090
All I remember
is glowy lights

27:27.124 --> 27:28.758
and feeling really,
really good.

27:28.792 --> 27:31.561
Like a speed ball,
but...way better.

27:31.595 --> 27:34.263
I gave you insight.

27:34.297 --> 27:35.431
Not a drug.

27:35.465 --> 27:36.766
Call it what you want,

27:36.800 --> 27:39.302
but put that in a bottle,
I'd crawl right inside.

27:43.340 --> 27:46.608
Do you feel any connection
at all with that man?

27:46.643 --> 27:48.310
Or anyone else right now?

27:48.345 --> 27:51.748
I just wanna go home.

27:51.782 --> 27:53.615
That could be a problem.

27:56.286 --> 27:58.288
Yep.

27:58.322 --> 27:59.990
- Right here.
- Yeah, right.

28:00.024 --> 28:02.192
- Bill...Bill...
- Yeah?

28:02.227 --> 28:03.928
Dr. Rosen's last Google.

28:03.962 --> 28:05.963
It shows that he went
to Connecticut,

28:05.998 --> 28:09.034
to a house that used
to belong to Fred Bask.

28:09.068 --> 28:11.102
And he--he was old,
and he died.

28:11.137 --> 28:13.971
And then he gave
his house away as a gift.

28:14.006 --> 28:15.506
To the Reverend
Jonas Englin.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.475
He's some sort
of a religious leader.

28:17.509 --> 28:18.743
Yeah, and he's
speaking tomorrow

28:18.777 --> 28:20.011
at a big church--
- Wait, wait, wait.

28:20.045 --> 28:22.380
So Rosen
is with a religious group?

28:22.414 --> 28:24.982
What the hell is going on?

28:33.391 --> 28:36.427
Excuse me, where's
the medication that was here?

28:36.461 --> 28:37.595
Father took it away.

28:41.834 --> 28:43.535
Of course I took it.

28:43.569 --> 28:44.736
Gil may live,

28:44.771 --> 28:46.772
but your poison
robbed him of my gift.

28:46.806 --> 28:50.876
Mr. Englin, your gift
is what is killing those people.

28:50.910 --> 28:52.211
That is a lie.
It's not me.

28:52.245 --> 28:54.779
It's the world!
It's the darkness!

28:54.814 --> 28:56.949
I understand that
you're going to be speaking

28:56.983 --> 28:58.550
to some sort of
religious gathering.

28:58.585 --> 29:00.352
To spread the light, yes.

29:00.386 --> 29:01.987
It's what
I was meant to do.

29:02.021 --> 29:03.856
And you're going to expose
all these people

29:03.890 --> 29:05.358
to your--your ability?

29:05.392 --> 29:08.127
Dr. Rosen...

29:08.162 --> 29:09.696
you've seen the pain.

29:09.730 --> 29:12.198
The indignities
all around us.

29:12.233 --> 29:13.467
The terrible things

29:13.501 --> 29:15.235
the unenlightened
do to themselves and others.

29:15.269 --> 29:17.905
I can change that.

29:17.939 --> 29:19.707
Or is this broken world
enough for you?

29:19.742 --> 29:22.277
Making people sick,
killing them, it--

29:22.311 --> 29:24.613
that's not gonna
fix anything.

29:24.647 --> 29:26.982
So will you please
give me back this medicine

29:27.017 --> 29:28.751
so that I can help
your people?

29:30.486 --> 29:35.157
Do you know what
the worst part of my gift is?

29:35.191 --> 29:37.059
I can't feel it.

29:37.093 --> 29:39.560
Like you, I'm trapped
in the darkness.

29:39.595 --> 29:42.229
I would sacrifice everything,
even my life,

29:42.264 --> 29:44.732
to experience for just
one moment

29:44.766 --> 29:46.500
what I give to others.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.469
So tell me what's better--

29:48.503 --> 29:49.804
a lifetime of suffering

29:49.838 --> 29:51.572
or a short time in paradise?

29:51.607 --> 29:54.009
You don't have the right
to make that choice for people!

29:54.043 --> 29:55.577
Well, neither do you.

29:55.611 --> 29:58.080
No more poison.

29:58.114 --> 30:00.449
You'll have to come up
with another answer.

30:00.484 --> 30:04.053
Find a way to give my people
paradise and life...

30:04.087 --> 30:06.756
or the others
are gonna die too...

30:06.791 --> 30:08.091
including Nina and Cameron.

30:10.928 --> 30:13.163
Stop. This is the address
on Rosen's computer.

30:13.197 --> 30:14.964
Okay, I'm picking up
a lot of heartbeats,

30:14.999 --> 30:16.599
40 or 50, at least.

30:16.634 --> 30:19.468
Do you at least hear Rosen
or Hicks or Nina?

30:19.503 --> 30:21.804
No, it's too far,
even for me.

30:21.838 --> 30:24.306
These dead bodies look like
barbecued chicken.

30:24.340 --> 30:26.274
Gary, not appropriate.

30:26.308 --> 30:27.375
This guy scares me.

30:27.409 --> 30:28.843
Like Jim Jones scary.

30:28.877 --> 30:30.077
Well, let's just hope
he hasn't started

30:30.112 --> 30:31.646
handing out
the purple kool-aid.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.048
Rachel, I need a visual
on an entry.

30:35.351 --> 30:37.586
Front door is covered.

30:37.620 --> 30:39.687
There's some windows
low on the side

30:39.722 --> 30:41.923
that nobody's watching--
we can go in that way.

30:41.958 --> 30:44.326
Well, no, no, no, no.
I'll go in alone, okay?

30:44.360 --> 30:45.327
- No!
- Bill, no.

30:45.361 --> 30:46.595
I go alone.

30:46.629 --> 30:47.596
If you don't hear from me
in 20 minutes,

30:47.630 --> 30:48.964
you call tactical.

30:48.998 --> 30:50.432
Let 'em know it's
a hostage situation, okay?

30:50.466 --> 30:51.533
- Bill, that's wrong.
- Let 'em know--

30:51.567 --> 30:52.701
under no circumstances

30:52.735 --> 30:54.236
are you to follow me
in here, Gary.

30:56.339 --> 30:58.474
But...

30:58.508 --> 31:00.677
Okay. Okay.

31:41.519 --> 31:43.520
Doc!

31:43.555 --> 31:44.822
Bill.

31:44.856 --> 31:46.490
Bill, you've got
to get out of here.

31:46.524 --> 31:47.491
Right now.

31:47.525 --> 31:49.026
Bill...

31:49.060 --> 31:50.393
Nina...

31:50.427 --> 31:53.396
Give me the gun.

31:59.235 --> 32:01.103
And come with me.

32:03.940 --> 32:05.006
Nina...

32:05.040 --> 32:07.675
Nina!
Nina, don't do this!

32:07.709 --> 32:09.282
Nina!

32:10.747 --> 32:11.947
Okay.

32:12.312 --> 32:13.745
Tactical's on their way.

32:14.364 --> 32:16.865
No, you have to sterilize
my phone when you use it.

32:16.899 --> 32:19.034
- Gary, I'm sorry, my--
- Bacteria.

32:19.068 --> 32:20.836
Ear wax.
I know, I know.

32:20.870 --> 32:22.537
I'm sorry, my phone
does not work up here.

32:22.572 --> 32:24.005
Here, it's clean.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.674
Thank you.

32:25.708 --> 32:28.176
This is wrong, though.

32:28.210 --> 32:29.344
Bill needs us.

32:29.379 --> 32:30.846
I bet he's in trouble
right now.

32:30.880 --> 32:31.847
We should just go in.

32:31.881 --> 32:33.348
Hey, no.
Bill said no.

32:33.382 --> 32:35.117
I don't hear any gunshots,
and there's no fighting.

32:35.151 --> 32:37.619
We wait.

32:37.654 --> 32:39.288
The police are coming here?

32:39.322 --> 32:41.391
It's not the police,
it's D.O.D., so...

32:41.425 --> 32:43.360
that means assault rifles,
flak jackets

32:43.394 --> 32:44.661
and armored vehicles

32:44.695 --> 32:47.398
and helicopters and...

32:47.432 --> 32:49.867
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I didn't know that--

32:49.901 --> 32:51.002
You can
call them off, right?

32:51.036 --> 32:52.103
No, I can't.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.805
They think it's
a hostage situation.

32:53.839 --> 32:55.106
They think I'm a hostage,

32:55.140 --> 32:58.775
and, oh, and Hicks
and Nina and Dr. Rosen.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.011
I must pray on this.

33:01.046 --> 33:02.646
We'll be all right.

33:07.418 --> 33:11.454
You guys have been
holding out on me, huh?

33:11.488 --> 33:14.456
I had no idea...I needed this.
I know.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.926
Everyone should
feel this way.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.827
Everyone will.

33:27.404 --> 33:30.773
You were a mistake.

33:30.808 --> 33:32.542
I never should have
agreed to bring you here.

33:32.576 --> 33:36.246
N-no, you were right
to bring me here.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.714
You wanted to help
these people,

33:37.748 --> 33:38.881
and so do I.

33:38.916 --> 33:40.349
I just need more time.

33:40.384 --> 33:41.918
Time?

33:41.952 --> 33:43.285
To find a treatment?

33:43.320 --> 33:45.721
Or time for your
government thugs

33:45.756 --> 33:47.123
to invade my home?

33:47.157 --> 33:50.026
No one wants any violence.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.927
I can bring peace
to the entire world.

33:51.962 --> 33:54.396
Why would I let anyone
stand in my way?

33:54.430 --> 33:59.635
Jonas, you are so much more
than your ability.

33:59.670 --> 34:02.505
Your message about
connectedness

34:02.539 --> 34:04.373
and that there's a light
in all of us,

34:04.408 --> 34:06.008
that is worth hearing.

34:06.043 --> 34:07.176
Those are just words.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.779
Without my gift,
they're just words.

34:09.813 --> 34:11.581
- Words have power.
- No!

34:11.616 --> 34:13.417
You want to make me
into a charlatan.

34:13.451 --> 34:15.418
Faith healing
and revival tents

34:15.453 --> 34:17.087
and bless you
for this donation.

34:17.121 --> 34:19.156
Jonas, your ability
is killing these people.

34:19.190 --> 34:23.259
I gave these people
paradise.

34:23.293 --> 34:24.960
Once they experience it,
they can't let it go.

34:24.995 --> 34:26.262
How do you know?

34:26.297 --> 34:27.630
Have you asked
any of them?

34:30.534 --> 34:31.568
What about Gil?

34:31.601 --> 34:33.036
He was ready
to drink again.

34:33.070 --> 34:35.304
You're asking me to let you
tear it away from them?

34:35.339 --> 34:37.907
- No.
- I'd rather die first.

34:37.942 --> 34:40.043
So would they.

34:40.077 --> 34:41.811
My father understood that.

34:41.846 --> 34:44.280
I never did until today.

34:46.150 --> 34:48.318
This time, I won't run
from the flames.

34:48.351 --> 34:49.518
You'll burn too.

34:49.553 --> 34:52.121
But you'll never
know paradise.

35:25.590 --> 35:26.623
Hey.

35:26.657 --> 35:28.658
You wanna try
to give me a hand?

35:28.693 --> 35:29.860
Gettin' lazy on me, Bill?

35:29.894 --> 35:31.361
No, I...I amped up,

35:31.396 --> 35:32.463
but it didn't work.

35:32.497 --> 35:33.564
- All right.
- It's weird.

36:11.137 --> 36:12.370
Cameron?

36:12.405 --> 36:14.539
Cameron...Cameron...

36:14.573 --> 36:16.574
What's wrong?

36:16.608 --> 36:18.309
He's been called.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.711
We all have.

36:29.553 --> 36:30.920
Oh, jeez.

36:56.086 --> 36:58.154
Don't be afraid.

36:58.188 --> 37:00.281
You came to me broken,

37:00.282 --> 37:01.482
looking for answers.

37:01.516 --> 37:03.818
From the pain that
infects this world.

37:03.852 --> 37:05.120
And I healed you.

37:05.154 --> 37:07.923
I showed you the light.

37:07.957 --> 37:09.057
The connection,
not just to each other,

37:09.091 --> 37:11.426
but to something
greater than ourselves.

37:12.795 --> 37:16.031
The outside world
doesn't understand it.

37:16.065 --> 37:20.936
They think everyone should
live in fear and darkness.

37:20.970 --> 37:23.538
It frightens them
that we live free

37:23.572 --> 37:25.974
and without worry.

37:26.008 --> 37:27.776
And now they are
beating down our walls,

37:27.811 --> 37:30.446
trying to destroy what we've
built here.

37:30.480 --> 37:33.082
It can't happen today.

37:33.116 --> 37:35.551
Today, the light
that shines from me

37:35.586 --> 37:37.653
shines for us all.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.689
Join me in the light.

37:39.723 --> 37:41.691
And we'll spend
eternity together.

37:41.725 --> 37:43.125
What are you doing?

37:43.160 --> 37:44.293
It's alright.

37:46.129 --> 37:47.329
Dr. Rosen...

37:47.364 --> 37:49.097
take your poison
out of here.

37:49.132 --> 37:50.833
Put the torch into
the furnace, Jonas, please.

37:50.867 --> 37:53.402
This is the only way out!

37:53.436 --> 37:54.636
Please do it.

37:54.671 --> 37:56.438
Lee...

37:56.473 --> 37:59.174
500 milligrams to as many
people as you can.

37:59.209 --> 38:00.676
- Nina, don't listen to him.
- No, no.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.945
- No, just don't move.
- Nina, no.

38:02.979 --> 38:05.014
You can't control them
anymore.

38:05.048 --> 38:07.016
I'm not gonna let you bring
darkness into my house.

38:07.051 --> 38:08.318
Don't do this, Jonas.

39:34.970 --> 39:36.638
Hey.

39:36.672 --> 39:39.041
Jonas's victims are responding
to the L-Dopa,

39:39.075 --> 39:41.377
like you said they would.

39:41.411 --> 39:44.213
I think tactical's got
everything under control.

39:44.248 --> 39:45.815
We can go.

40:04.502 --> 40:06.503
Oh, I see him.
Stop.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.105
Dad! Dad.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.081
I talked to mom.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.416
She said cancer.

40:19.451 --> 40:20.918
Stage one.

40:20.952 --> 40:21.919
It's very treatable.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.454
They never catch it
this early.

40:23.488 --> 40:25.522
But then...

40:25.557 --> 40:28.325
no one else has
a daughter like you.

40:28.360 --> 40:31.528
I'm so glad.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.497
You're a miracle.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.970
Now...your Aunt Parashtou.

40:38.004 --> 40:39.938
She's coming to dinner.
Okay.

40:39.973 --> 40:42.508
Uh, she's got a mole
she needs you to look at.

40:44.711 --> 40:45.777
Okay.

40:49.549 --> 40:50.583
Hey.

40:52.385 --> 40:53.385
Hey.

40:55.221 --> 40:56.255
So...

40:56.289 --> 40:58.057
group should be
interesting today.

41:00.760 --> 41:02.195
We're not gonna
talk about it, right?

41:02.229 --> 41:04.563
What happened between us.

41:06.233 --> 41:09.869
I figure that's
a private conversation.

41:09.903 --> 41:13.339
I'll just pretend
it never happened.

41:13.374 --> 41:16.142
I'll talk about Tyler,
how he's leaving and, uh,

41:16.177 --> 41:18.111
how I can't stop it.

41:20.982 --> 41:23.217
Still can't believe
Rosen saw us naked.

41:31.293 --> 41:33.928
Doc, you ready?
We're waiting on you.

41:33.963 --> 41:35.964
In a minute.

41:35.998 --> 41:37.632
You okay?

41:39.936 --> 41:41.203
Am I okay?

41:41.238 --> 41:42.438
Well...

41:42.472 --> 41:44.140
I killed a man, Bill.

41:44.174 --> 41:46.009
No, you killed a bad guy

41:46.043 --> 41:48.911
and saved a whole lot of folks
from being barbecued.

41:48.945 --> 41:50.546
That's the part
you hold onto.

41:52.916 --> 41:54.749
How does it feel?

41:55.751 --> 41:57.018
The light.

41:57.052 --> 41:59.053
Oh, I, um...

41:59.087 --> 42:01.055
never felt better
in my life.

42:01.089 --> 42:02.923
I mean, I still
can't amp up,

42:02.957 --> 42:05.092
and I'm glad to be
among the breathing,

42:05.126 --> 42:06.827
but...

42:06.861 --> 42:09.229
You know, Bill...

42:09.263 --> 42:12.399
the D.O.D. is going
to cover this whole thing up.

42:12.433 --> 42:14.434
If you kill someone,
you should pay a price.

42:14.469 --> 42:16.537
You are definitely
paying the price.

42:17.906 --> 42:20.513
So why don't we
just go and...Talk about it

42:20.538 --> 42:22.828
with the group, or...not, or...

42:23.460 --> 42:24.660
Okay, Dr. Harken.

42:26.399 --> 42:27.599
Alright, then...

42:27.624 --> 42:30.565
here's some advice...
next time aim for the chest.

42:31.029 --> 42:32.229
It's an easier stop.

42:32.858 --> 42:34.651
I was aiming for his chest.
