00:24.324 --> 00:27.594
If your heels
are nimble and light,

00:27.627 --> 00:31.464
you may get there
by candlelight.

00:33.166 --> 00:36.236
How many miles to Babylon?

00:36.269 --> 00:39.739
Three score and ten.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.275
Can I get there by candlelight?

00:42.308 --> 00:46.112
Yes, and back again.

00:49.182 --> 00:52.118
If your heels
are nimble and light,

00:52.152 --> 00:54.521
you may get there
by candlelight.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.390
How many miles to Babylon?

00:57.424 --> 01:00.193
Three score and ten.

01:00.226 --> 01:03.229
Can I get there by candlelight?

01:03.263 --> 01:05.432
Yes, and back again.

01:05.465 --> 01:09.135
If your heels
are nimble and light,

01:09.169 --> 01:13.139
you may get there
by candlelight.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.909
How many miles to Babylon?

01:15.942 --> 01:17.811
Three score and ten.

01:17.844 --> 01:20.213
Can I get there by candlelight?

01:20.246 --> 01:22.582
Yes, and back again.

01:22.615 --> 01:25.618
How many miles to Babylon?

01:25.652 --> 01:27.520
Three score and ten.

01:27.554 --> 01:29.556
Can I get there by candlelight?

01:29.589 --> 01:32.125
Yes, and back again.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.200
Jack?

01:41.901 --> 01:43.870
What are you doing up?

01:43.903 --> 01:47.273
Look, there's a...

01:47.307 --> 01:49.375
You must've been having a dream.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.778
It's no wonder
you're stirred up.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.347
I wasn't able to sleep, myself.

01:58.251 --> 02:00.386
Out of sight, out of mind.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.659
We should try
and get some sleep.

02:06.693 --> 02:09.395
It's gonna be
a big day tomorrow.

04:13.119 --> 04:14.420
Boo.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.589
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.625
Here.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.832
That's it?

04:31.404 --> 04:35.541
All my promises are
about to come true.

04:35.575 --> 04:38.444
No more worrying
about the mortgage,

04:38.478 --> 04:41.948
no more having to
work for that S.O.B.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.752
Let's see what they offer you
before we start

04:45.785 --> 04:47.787
counting any chickens.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.664
Jack, go on, before you're late.

05:02.869 --> 05:06.572
Maybe we'll celebrate our
next anniversary on the moon.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.564
Come on. Shit.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.137
What time is it?

05:38.171 --> 05:39.105
Sorry?

05:39.138 --> 05:40.139
What time?

05:43.576 --> 05:46.546
He should be here
any minute, sir.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.848
Excuse me, would either
of you like a refill?

05:48.881 --> 05:51.818
This is second cup, Alice.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.754
If he's much longer,
I will burst.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.457
Sorry.

05:58.891 --> 06:00.893
Hey! Off the lawn!

06:02.995 --> 06:05.031
I'd just like to thank you,
again, Professor,

06:05.064 --> 06:06.566
for agreeing
to sponsor our project.

06:06.599 --> 06:09.202
I'm already starting
to regret it.

06:11.971 --> 06:13.639
Sorry.

06:13.673 --> 06:14.941
Sorry. I'm here.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.042
I have seminar starting.

06:16.075 --> 06:17.610
We need to be fast.

06:17.643 --> 06:19.779
The professor's taking us
to see our new lab.

06:19.812 --> 06:20.847
Lead the way.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.582
Thanks for starting without me.

06:22.615 --> 06:23.783
What was I supposed to do?

06:23.816 --> 06:25.518
We had no idea when
you were coming.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.096
It's not my fault,
my truck wouldn't start.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.821
You think I'd be late - today?

06:28.855 --> 06:30.056
Hey.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.492
Smile, Rich, we made it.

06:32.525 --> 06:36.796
You will be working here,
under my guidance.

06:36.829 --> 06:41.701
As I told Richard,
before you made grand entrance,

06:41.734 --> 06:45.805
you need to figure out
the basic science of your work.

06:45.838 --> 06:49.509
Even Wright brothers
tested over 50 models

06:49.542 --> 06:51.844
to establish
new lift coefficient

06:51.878 --> 06:54.881
before they make
plane that can fly.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.983
Well, we're gonna
make their plane

06:57.016 --> 06:58.684
look like a horse-drawn buggy.

06:58.718 --> 07:03.923
What I mean is, I expect
the same theoretical rigor

07:03.956 --> 07:05.958
from you two.

07:08.127 --> 07:09.962
Here we are.

07:09.996 --> 07:13.633
Home of Caltech's
first ever rocketry team.

07:13.666 --> 07:17.136
Let us hope
it is not also the last.

07:22.141 --> 07:25.044
Fantastic.

07:28.247 --> 07:30.049
So this is the room
you're giving us?

07:30.082 --> 07:32.051
Once you clear out, of course.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.853
Richard?

07:35.054 --> 07:37.256
What about the rest of it?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.258
My partner said
sponsored projects

07:39.292 --> 07:41.761
get all the resources
they need from the university.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.763
Normally, that is the case,

07:43.796 --> 07:45.765
but yours is far
from normal project.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.936
You were able to produce

07:49.969 --> 07:54.707
a-an impressive amount
of thrust in the desert.

07:54.740 --> 07:57.009
I'm giving opportunity to prove

07:57.043 --> 07:58.978
this was not a fluke.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.847
That was no fluke.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.981
It was a breakthrough.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.851
Maybe. But question is,

08:04.884 --> 08:09.021
can you repeat result
without killing anybody?

08:09.055 --> 08:11.657
Design a rocket motor
that can sustain

08:11.691 --> 08:16.028
200 pounds of thrust
for at least a minute,

08:16.062 --> 08:20.566
then we can talk about
additional resources.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.736
How are we gonna build
anything without any money?

08:23.769 --> 08:27.039
He said "design," not "build."

08:27.073 --> 08:29.909
This is why
he gets perfect marks.

08:29.942 --> 08:32.912
Yes, Richard, there will be

08:32.945 --> 08:37.950
no tests on campus without my
approval of a written proposal.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.952
From humble beginnings,

08:39.986 --> 08:41.988
I expect great things.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.962
Welcome to Caltech.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.805
What do you think this does?

08:59.839 --> 09:01.908
No idea.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.877
We should probably hold
onto it, just in case.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.846
We're supposed to be
clearing the space out,

09:06.879 --> 09:09.115
not adding
to your personal collection.

09:09.148 --> 09:12.818
Whoa, look at this
old accelerometer.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.387
It's probably broken.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.231
Besides, we're not gonna be
measuring acceleration

09:16.255 --> 09:17.657
anytime soon.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.091
Of course we will.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.127
Were you listening?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.862
We have to solve
for the basic science

09:22.895 --> 09:24.130
before we launch anything.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.332
Just because we're
at Caltech now

09:26.365 --> 09:27.743
doesn't mean we have
to completely change

09:27.767 --> 09:29.769
the way we work.

09:34.173 --> 09:37.743
Listen, I know that explosion
might've spooked you a little.

09:37.777 --> 09:39.745
No, what-what spooks me

09:39.779 --> 09:42.748
is that it doesn't seem
to have spooked you at all.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.784
Well, we can either
dwell on the past,

09:44.817 --> 09:46.285
or we can start
writing the proposal

09:46.319 --> 09:49.388
for our next test rocket.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.824
The sooner we do that, the
sooner we get it built.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.327
The sooner we get it built,
the sooner we get funding.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.329
No, Jack, we're not here
to build rockets.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.331
We're here to build
rocket science.

09:58.364 --> 09:59.699
What's the difference?

09:59.732 --> 10:00.732
The difference...

10:03.069 --> 10:06.272
Look, I don't think
that we can do this alone.

10:06.305 --> 10:09.909
I think we should fill out
our team and find people

10:09.942 --> 10:12.745
who have an expertise
that neither of us possess.

10:12.778 --> 10:17.083
Fluid dynamics, physics,
applied mathematics.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.052
You don't think we're capable
of figuring that stuff out?

10:20.086 --> 10:21.887
No, I don't.

10:21.921 --> 10:25.458
We have access to some of the
brightest minds on Earth, now.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.226
Why wouldn't
we take advantage of that?

10:27.259 --> 10:28.794
Because we got this far
on our own.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.129
You remember what von Braun

10:30.162 --> 10:32.031
wrote to me in his letter?

10:32.064 --> 10:34.233
He has, he has 20 people
working under him.

10:34.266 --> 10:36.035
It's just how things
are done here, Jack.

10:36.068 --> 10:39.205
What we're doing wasn't done
here at all until today.

10:40.272 --> 10:43.376
I got to get back to work.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.721
My "doctor's appointment" was
supposed to be over an hour ago.

10:45.745 --> 10:48.014
So we're agreed, then, yes?

10:48.047 --> 10:49.181
Sure.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.317
Whatever you say.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.064
Parsons.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.800
Don't care if you're sick,
you're on the clock.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.802
Plenty of other guys
be happy for the work

11:09.835 --> 11:12.171
if you don't want it.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.128
Hey.

11:36.162 --> 11:39.131
I'm just about done here.

11:39.165 --> 11:42.501
Just need that magic ingredient.

11:43.869 --> 11:47.173
The key, see if she starts.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.208
You fixed my truck?

11:49.241 --> 11:51.110
That was the idea.

11:51.143 --> 11:52.845
Come on, get in.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.880
See if she goes.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.143
Really gun her!

12:24.176 --> 12:26.545
Check she's firing
on all cylinders!

12:26.579 --> 12:29.415
Ain't that the sweetest sound?

12:29.448 --> 12:30.416
What did you do to it?

12:30.449 --> 12:33.152
Opened up the venturis,
draw some more air in.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.554
A trick I learned
when I used to race stock cars.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.791
You are gonna notice
a lot more power.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.935
What's going on?

12:49.969 --> 12:52.338
I went in to find
what was broken,

12:52.371 --> 12:54.073
saw a way to make it
even better.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.307
Why?

12:55.341 --> 12:57.843
That's what neighbors do.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.846
We keep an eye out
for one another.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.618
Is this about what I saw?

13:05.651 --> 13:07.103
Depends. What did you see?

13:07.104 --> 13:08.554
That woman.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.222
- What woman?
- The one who almost had.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.357
A knife put through her.

13:11.390 --> 13:16.128
A human sacrifice?
That'd be something.

13:21.133 --> 13:24.637
She has been peeking out
at me all afternoon.

13:24.670 --> 13:27.273
Never came out to offer me
a refreshment or even say hi.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.475
Now, you can tell her from me,
"I do not bite."

13:33.345 --> 13:35.147
You ever need anything,

13:35.181 --> 13:38.017
ever again, you know
where to find me.

13:51.263 --> 13:54.266
I think we should
call the police.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.102
And what? Have him arrested
for fixing our car?

13:57.136 --> 14:00.206
He's probably the one who
broke it in the first place.

14:00.239 --> 14:02.374
Only to make it run better.

14:02.408 --> 14:06.278
I can't figure out
what this guy's after.

14:06.312 --> 14:08.447
Well, it seems pretty obvious.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.049
You saw something
you shouldn't have,

14:10.082 --> 14:12.384
and now he's making sure
you don't tell anybody.

14:12.418 --> 14:14.453
Maybe it was a mistake
to tell you.

14:14.486 --> 14:18.057
Do you think he
knows that I know?

14:18.090 --> 14:19.391
That's not what I meant.

14:19.425 --> 14:24.263
I don't think he's
trying to scare us.

14:24.296 --> 14:26.565
Or at least, that's not all
he's trying to do.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.475
My father taught me
about symbols like this.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.010
Your father?

14:38.043 --> 14:41.046
This was before he left.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.416
I was seven or eight.

14:44.450 --> 14:48.020
Most parents teach their
children the ABCs at that age.

14:48.053 --> 14:52.424
Marvel wasn't most parents.

14:52.458 --> 14:56.996
No, I suppose not.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.398
He told me they're not
all meant as hexes.

15:02.334 --> 15:04.303
Some are gateways.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.373
Gateways to what?

15:09.375 --> 15:12.378
Hey. You know I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.513
It's silly. We should
be celebrating.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.082
Instead, we're talking about
that creep across the way.

15:17.116 --> 15:20.452
Then let's forget
about all this and celebrate.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.191
To all our dreams coming true.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.665
What is weighing on you

15:32.698 --> 15:34.700
today, my child?

15:37.603 --> 15:40.539
How can you tell when you're
in the presence of evil?

15:42.541 --> 15:46.078
I mean, did Eve know
the serpent was evil,

15:46.111 --> 15:48.247
and that's what tempted her?

15:48.280 --> 15:51.016
Or was she so innocent that
she just didn't know any better?

15:51.050 --> 15:55.688
I take it you're here on behalf
of your husband again.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.589
Yes.

15:57.623 --> 16:01.126
What precisely
are we talking about now?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.528
This new neighbor of ours.

16:02.561 --> 16:06.265
I find his behavior
repellent, but Jack...

16:06.298 --> 16:08.734
he almost seems compelled.

16:08.767 --> 16:11.603
What threat does this man pose?

16:11.637 --> 16:13.772
That is precisely what
I would like to find out,

16:13.806 --> 16:16.408
but Jack refuses to
listen to reason.

16:16.442 --> 16:20.212
Susan, it has been a joy
to see you grow up

16:20.245 --> 16:24.416
to be such an upright,
responsible young woman.

16:24.450 --> 16:29.788
Do you have anything to confess?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.757
I do, Father.

16:35.127 --> 16:39.365
Jack and I are still
taking precautions.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.800
We talked about this.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.369
I know.

16:43.402 --> 16:46.538
You speak of Eve.

16:46.572 --> 16:49.208
Do you remember
the first instruction

16:49.241 --> 16:51.610
she was given?

16:51.643 --> 16:54.513
Be fruitful and multiply.

16:54.546 --> 16:55.848
I know.

16:55.881 --> 17:00.085
I am sorry for this
and all of my sins.

17:00.119 --> 17:03.589
What would you have me do?

17:03.622 --> 17:06.191
Simple.

17:06.224 --> 17:09.261
A flower only opens

17:09.294 --> 17:11.597
for a bee who's come
to pollinate.

17:14.133 --> 17:17.368
There's a pecking order
that must be respected.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.505
Colleagues ask questions first,

17:19.538 --> 17:22.441
then the grad students,
then, if there's time,

17:22.473 --> 17:24.810
undergrads.

17:24.843 --> 17:27.413
Where am I on that list?

17:27.445 --> 17:28.614
I doubt I'll have much to say

17:28.647 --> 17:31.683
about the laminar boundary layer
around an elliptic cylinder.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.552
The topic is not important.

17:33.585 --> 17:37.222
Every student from GALCIT
will be there.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.425
This is where we should
be recruiting people.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.860
Yeah, right.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.595
This is where the best
and brightest minds

17:43.629 --> 17:46.365
on campus congregate, right?

17:46.398 --> 17:48.233
We should be in there with them.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.368
Don't, Jack.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.537
The Athenaeum is invite only.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.704
We'll see about that.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.848
The lecture is in ten minutes.

17:53.872 --> 17:57.576
Hold your horses. I'm just gonna
get a quick peek inside.

17:57.609 --> 18:00.579
Good day, sir. Is there
something I can help you with?

18:00.612 --> 18:02.815
Yeah, maybe you can.
I'm looking for the room

18:02.848 --> 18:04.066
my pal Bertie ate in.

18:04.067 --> 18:05.284
Bertie?

18:05.317 --> 18:07.619
As in Einstein.
His friends call him Bertie.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.288
Are you a member
of the faculty club?

18:09.321 --> 18:11.657
You never know, I may be.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.358
Well, the moment you're invited,

18:13.392 --> 18:15.403
you're more than welcome
to look in any room you like.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.396
In the meantime,
please be on your way.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.565
Your loitering is bothering
our guests.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.535
Good afternoon,
Professor Hammond.

18:23.569 --> 18:27.873
Some day, this place
is gonna be begging me to join,

18:27.906 --> 18:31.210
and I'll agree
on one condition only:

18:31.243 --> 18:33.345
That they fire
their fucking doorman.

18:35.414 --> 18:37.683
In most cases, the
boundary layer is turbulent

18:37.716 --> 18:39.585
over much of the airfoil.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.221
But the properties of the
small laminar region downstream

18:42.254 --> 18:44.389
from the stagnation point

18:44.423 --> 18:47.292
have a noticeable impact
on the transition phenomena.

18:47.326 --> 18:50.863
I would like to thank
Professor Mesulam

18:50.896 --> 18:53.966
for his generosity in checking
the mathematical derivations.

18:53.999 --> 18:58.203
If there remains any questions
that you would like to ask,

18:58.237 --> 19:01.240
I will now briefly
open the floor.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.875
Yes, you in the back.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.277
Thank you for that
illuminating talk, Professor.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.222
I've learned everything
I would ever want to know

19:07.246 --> 19:08.780
about laminar boundary layers,

19:08.814 --> 19:12.417
but I'm curious if you've ever
given thought to aircraft

19:12.451 --> 19:15.354
that wouldn't experience
that sort of air friction?

19:15.387 --> 19:16.889
I'm afraid I don't follow.

19:16.922 --> 19:18.824
I don't mean aircraft
designed to fly

19:18.857 --> 19:20.826
within Earth's atmosphere,

19:20.859 --> 19:23.395
but those designed to
leave Earth altogether.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.565
Which one of my students
put you up to this?

19:26.598 --> 19:28.233
No one did, sir.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.435
I'm not interested
in playing along.

19:30.469 --> 19:33.005
Is there anyone who would like
to ask a serious question?

19:33.038 --> 19:34.540
I am being serious.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.275
My partner here and I
are heading up.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.976
Caltech's first
project dedicated

19:38.010 --> 19:39.912
to the science of rocketry.

19:42.781 --> 19:46.752
This is the project you left
the propeller team for,

19:46.785 --> 19:48.754
Mr. Onsted?

19:50.422 --> 19:53.292
Speak up, Richard.
I don't think they heard you.

19:53.325 --> 19:55.928
Um, yes, sir.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.297
Yes, it is, Professor Tillman.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.666
Because he realized
the same thing I did,

20:00.699 --> 20:03.969
that propellers
are a dying technology.

20:04.002 --> 20:05.971
This institute prides itself

20:06.004 --> 20:08.674
on breaking new frontiers,
and yet, I can't help but notice

20:08.707 --> 20:11.510
a certain acquiescence
to the status quo.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.712
The question you all
must ask yourselves:

20:13.745 --> 20:15.681
Do you wish to merely
be technicians,

20:15.714 --> 20:17.583
- or are you innovators?
- That's enough.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.561
Rockets are the future, whether
you want to believe in them

20:19.585 --> 20:21.053
or not.

20:21.086 --> 20:22.897
And Mr. Onsted and I are going
to build machines

20:22.921 --> 20:25.424
that will allow mankind
to explore the cosmos,

20:25.457 --> 20:26.792
and we're looking for

20:26.825 --> 20:29.528
a few fortunate souls
to join our team.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.630
Only the most brilliant

20:31.663 --> 20:35.367
and bold among you need apply.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.035
No, no. No, no, no.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.972
What's your name?

20:41.673 --> 20:44.376
Parsons, sir. Jack Parsons.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.711
Are you a student?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.713
I'm entirely unfamiliar
with you.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.381
I'm not a student, no.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.350
I'm a chemist, primarily.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.018
You kidding me?

20:53.051 --> 20:55.921
"A chemist, primarily"?

20:55.954 --> 20:57.689
Perhaps you're aptly named Jack,

20:57.723 --> 21:00.726
as in "of all trades..."

21:00.759 --> 21:02.961
master of none"?

21:02.995 --> 21:04.863
I'd venture to say
I know more about chemistry

21:04.896 --> 21:06.098
than anyone in this room.

21:06.131 --> 21:08.000
I'd venture to say

21:08.033 --> 21:10.636
that you'd venture to say
a lot of things.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.615
You claim you're working on
the science of rocketry,

21:13.639 --> 21:15.016
but that's a contradiction
in terms.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.042
Rockets aren't science.

21:17.075 --> 21:21.113
They're a harebrained idea
fit only for Hollywood films.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.815
And here's why.

21:25.817 --> 21:29.488
I, realize
you're primarily a chemist,

21:29.521 --> 21:31.456
but a man working on rockets

21:31.490 --> 21:33.659
ought to be familiar with
the basics of aeronautics.

21:47.072 --> 21:50.442
Do you know what
this equation suggests?

21:54.046 --> 21:55.047
Excuse me.

21:55.080 --> 21:55.981
What's the matter?

21:56.014 --> 21:57.883
Surely a man as confident
as yourself knows

21:57.916 --> 22:00.852
the fundamental equation
of airplane performance.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.521
Since we don't have all day,

22:02.554 --> 22:05.624
let me explain in terms
a layman would understand.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.492
From this equation,
one could extrapolate

22:07.526 --> 22:09.995
that the amount of fuel needed
for an aircraft

22:10.028 --> 22:13.432
to achieve thrust greater than
the pull of gravity

22:13.465 --> 22:16.501
would be so heavy as to render
such a feat impossible.

22:16.535 --> 22:19.404
Or, unless you've come up
with some kind of

22:19.438 --> 22:23.075
magical fuel that none of us
have ever heard of?

22:23.108 --> 22:24.876
I haven't,

22:24.910 --> 22:26.945
but that doesn't mean I won't.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.447
Excuse me?

22:28.480 --> 22:29.915
Just because the
math doesn't exist

22:29.948 --> 22:31.526
for what we're trying
to do, doesn't mean

22:31.550 --> 22:33.085
what we're trying
to do can't exist.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.087
And maybe gravity will reverse,

22:35.120 --> 22:37.055
and maybe the sky
will turn purple,

22:37.089 --> 22:40.492
and maybe, just maybe,
Santa Claus is real.

22:44.062 --> 22:46.832
This is Caltech, Mr. Parsons.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.101
We don't deal in fantasy.

22:49.134 --> 22:51.737
We deal in hard facts.

26:02.661 --> 26:03.895
Jack?

26:03.929 --> 26:06.131
Why didn't you tell me
you were home?

26:09.701 --> 26:11.069
What are you doing?

26:11.102 --> 26:13.738
I tried knocking.
Nobody answered.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.941
So you just came in?

26:15.974 --> 26:18.109
Orange tree in my backyard
is going bananas.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.918
Anyway, I got more than
I know what to do with,

26:21.947 --> 26:24.292
so thought I'd come over, make
you some fresh-pressed juice.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.384
Got to find a juicer.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.120
Jack will be home any minute.

26:29.154 --> 26:30.655
Don't worry.

26:30.689 --> 26:31.923
There's plenty for everybody.

26:31.957 --> 26:34.426
Ooh, got you.

26:34.459 --> 26:37.162
You know,
for someone who's married

26:37.195 --> 26:39.230
to a man who handles
dangerous chemicals all day,

26:39.264 --> 26:42.701
I thought you'd have
a thicker skin.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.102
Come on. Sit down.

26:44.135 --> 26:46.204
Make yourself comfortable.

27:05.357 --> 27:08.760
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

27:10.762 --> 27:12.831
Are you and Jack happy?

27:12.864 --> 27:15.233
Are you?

27:17.035 --> 27:18.937
Of course.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.407
It's just,
he's out of the house a lot,

27:22.440 --> 27:26.144
and he could be up to anything
and you'd never know.

27:26.177 --> 27:29.214
I know exactly what he's doing.

27:29.247 --> 27:33.118
Well, I guess it cuts both ways.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.919
You could be up to anything

27:34.953 --> 27:36.688
while he's out
and he'd never know.

27:38.289 --> 27:40.759
I don't... I don't know
what you're implying,

27:40.792 --> 27:44.195
but Jack and I
tell each other everything.

27:44.229 --> 27:46.464
Of course you do.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.968
The lie of marriage.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.971
You think you know somebody,
but there are some things

27:53.004 --> 27:57.108
that you can never truly know.

28:01.046 --> 28:03.248
Why are you doing this?

28:03.281 --> 28:05.016
I'm just curious.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.352
You know, some people
read books, and...

28:07.385 --> 28:09.254
I read people.

28:36.147 --> 28:38.817
On a farm just
outside Creve Coeur, Missouri.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.785
Now, I don't speak French,

28:40.819 --> 28:42.987
but supposedly
that means brokenhearted.

28:43.021 --> 28:44.355
No one's happy there.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.523
Small-minded people

28:45.557 --> 28:48.159
living small-minded lives.

28:48.193 --> 28:51.229
Welcome home.

28:51.262 --> 28:54.365
Just getting better acquainted
with your lovely wife here.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.034
Get out.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.168
Excuse me?

28:57.202 --> 28:58.837
I said get out.

28:58.870 --> 29:00.472
You can't just come
into a man's home.

29:00.505 --> 29:03.408
Do you only go places
where you're allowed?

29:03.441 --> 29:07.078
A bit of the pot calling
the kettle black.

29:07.112 --> 29:09.247
I'm just trying to
share my bounty, Jack.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.815
I like to share things.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.317
Let me ask you something.

29:12.350 --> 29:14.319
When you were a boy and
tried to summon the devil,

29:14.352 --> 29:17.856
you ever wonder what you'd have
done if he'd actually shown up?

29:21.559 --> 29:24.329
We think he's part of one of
those fringe religious groups

29:24.362 --> 29:26.431
that are popping up
all over the city.

29:26.464 --> 29:29.100
He stuck this to our door.

29:35.473 --> 29:37.575
What do you think
the "93" means?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.911
That we're gonna be the 93rd?

29:39.944 --> 29:41.079
93rd...?

29:41.112 --> 29:42.514
Victim, or something?

29:42.547 --> 29:45.617
Pretty sure if this guy
had 92 other victims,

29:45.650 --> 29:47.252
we'd know about it.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.420
Yes. Of course.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.556
He try something when
he was alone with you?

29:51.589 --> 29:55.527
No. Not exactly.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.129
He was acting
menacing enough though.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.431
Asking all these
strange questions.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.867
But he didn't take nothin'?

30:05.103 --> 30:07.272
Not that we're aware of, no.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.477
What are you going to do?

30:12.510 --> 30:13.611
Lot of kooks out there.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.146
If we arrested every one,

30:15.180 --> 30:17.248
no space left
for the actual criminals.

30:17.282 --> 30:18.459
But what if
he threatens us again?

30:18.483 --> 30:19.951
Well, like my pop always said,

30:19.984 --> 30:22.353
"Best way to stop a bully

30:22.387 --> 30:24.222
is to bully him back."

30:46.611 --> 30:48.179
Did you tell him?

30:48.213 --> 30:49.280
What?

30:49.314 --> 30:50.682
About my dream?

30:50.715 --> 30:52.984
You think I'd tell
that lunatic anything?

30:53.017 --> 30:55.019
How long was he in here
before you came in?

30:55.053 --> 30:57.322
I have no idea.

30:59.157 --> 31:00.491
Son of a bitch.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.360
That must be how he knew!

31:02.393 --> 31:05.196
Knew what?

31:05.230 --> 31:07.465
Jack, what are you going to do?

31:14.439 --> 31:16.040
Howdy, neighbor.

31:16.074 --> 31:18.376
How do you like having
a fucking knife pointed at you?

31:18.409 --> 31:20.445
I've faced worse.

31:25.316 --> 31:26.985
What're you looking for?

31:27.018 --> 31:28.229
What's the matter?
You don't like people

31:28.253 --> 31:29.621
going through - your - Shit?

31:30.655 --> 31:33.625
Fascinating read.

31:33.658 --> 31:35.960
Too bad you're nothing like
the man who wrote it.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.562
I am the man who wrote it.

31:37.595 --> 31:38.930
I don't think so.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.336
The boy who wrote that knew
who he was and what he wanted.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.005
He wanted to perform magic,

31:47.038 --> 31:49.607
ride a comet, conjure the devil.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.185
The man in front of me
leaves in a three-piece

31:51.209 --> 31:52.610
in the morning,
gets back at night

31:52.644 --> 31:55.380
in a goddamn monkey suit
with his name stitched in it.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.316
All these different costumes.
No fucking idea who he is.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.094
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

32:00.118 --> 32:01.619
Keep trying to work so hard

32:01.653 --> 32:03.254
to keep up the illusion
that you matter,

32:03.288 --> 32:04.522
but you know you don't.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.591
You know
that if you died tomorrow,

32:06.624 --> 32:08.993
the world would
just go on spinning.

32:09.027 --> 32:11.129
I know, 'cause I used
to be the same.

32:11.162 --> 32:14.198
Then I found a different way.

32:14.232 --> 32:17.135
The note I left
was not a threat.

32:17.168 --> 32:19.370
It was an invitation.

32:19.404 --> 32:21.773
To what?

32:21.806 --> 32:23.508
A place where you can be the man

32:23.541 --> 32:24.776
you always dreamed of being.

32:24.809 --> 32:26.678
I don't need help.

32:26.711 --> 32:29.147
I just got my foot
in the door at Caltech.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.416
You don't believe me?

32:31.449 --> 32:35.119
Stodgy place like that'll never
appreciate a man like you.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.221
Everything you know,
you learned in your garage.

32:37.255 --> 32:39.400
- So what?
- They're gonna do everything in their power.

32:39.424 --> 32:42.460
To make you feel like you don't
belong, if they haven't already.

32:42.493 --> 32:44.662
You can stop proselytizing.
I'm not interested.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.532
Really? Or are you just chicken?

32:47.565 --> 32:49.267
Call me that one more time.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.736
Or what? You're gonna call
the police on me again?

32:59.811 --> 33:02.580
How much longer do you need
to keep working there?

33:02.613 --> 33:06.484
My boss asked me to stay until
they can find a replacement.

33:06.517 --> 33:09.721
I felt bad leaving them
in the lurch,

33:09.754 --> 33:11.689
so I'm gonna
work there weekdays.

33:11.723 --> 33:15.293
Nights and weekends
with Richard for a while.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.328
I thought your position
at Caltech would mean

33:17.362 --> 33:19.597
I'd get to see more
of you, not less.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.399
Yeah, it will,

33:21.432 --> 33:24.802
once Pueblo can find someone
to fill my shoes.

33:24.836 --> 33:28.272
Granted, they are
pretty big shoes to fill.

33:30.241 --> 33:32.143
Just make sure you
keep this Sunday free.

33:32.176 --> 33:35.546
We have dinner with my family.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.316
He specifically asked
if you'd be there.

33:38.349 --> 33:42.320
All the more reason to skip it.

33:42.353 --> 33:45.857
I think we need to stay
on his good side, don't you?

33:45.890 --> 33:50.628
He's keeping us
in the bank's good graces.

33:50.661 --> 33:55.266
Unless you think that's no
longer going to be an issue?

33:55.299 --> 33:57.535
All right. I'll go.

33:57.568 --> 34:00.338
I'll even bring my mother.

34:00.371 --> 34:03.841
Make Virgil think twice
about inviting us next time.

34:08.413 --> 34:12.382
And when you go out
today, lock the doors.

34:12.417 --> 34:14.152
I thought you dealt with him.

34:14.185 --> 34:16.687
I did. Just in case.

35:11.709 --> 35:13.711
My mailbox was stuffed full
of them this morning.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.580
You mean, what I did paid off?

35:15.613 --> 35:18.616
Sure did. This is a promising CV

35:18.649 --> 35:21.552
from a Mr. Gordon,
first name Flash.

35:21.586 --> 35:23.588
This one is from John Carter,

35:23.621 --> 35:25.490
sent all the way
from Mars, apparently.

35:25.523 --> 35:26.958
This one's from Buck Rogers.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.602
That one should go
to the top of the heap,

35:28.626 --> 35:29.894
don't you think?

35:29.927 --> 35:31.529
This is quite a team

35:31.562 --> 35:33.498
that you have managed
to assemble here, Jack.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.739
What the hell are you
guys doing here?

35:41.772 --> 35:42.940
We're here for the rockets.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.475
Let me guess.

35:44.509 --> 35:46.344
You're the Green Hornet
and he's Kato.

35:46.377 --> 35:47.678
What?

35:48.679 --> 35:50.515
No.

35:50.548 --> 35:53.784
This is just to keep the head
warm and to attract the dames.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.219
And Kato

35:55.253 --> 35:56.721
is Japanese,
if I'm not mistaken.

35:56.754 --> 35:59.724
Chiang here is Chinese.

35:59.757 --> 36:01.626
Is that right?

36:01.659 --> 36:04.629
It's a good thing he doesn't
listen to the Green Hornet,

36:04.662 --> 36:06.907
'cause nothing pisses him off
like people making that mistake.

36:06.931 --> 36:11.369
Samson Hunt's the name,
fluid dynamic's the game.

36:11.402 --> 36:13.004
"Samson Hunt"?

36:13.905 --> 36:15.439
You know these guys?

36:15.473 --> 36:16.508
I know

36:16.509 --> 36:17.542
of.

36:15.473 --> 36:17.542
Them.

36:17.575 --> 36:20.678
They've had some trouble getting
onto any other thesis teams.

36:20.711 --> 36:24.248
Well, that's because nobody gave
Chiang the respect he deserves,

36:24.282 --> 36:25.626
but he sparked to what you
said in Tillman's lecture

36:25.650 --> 36:27.852
about you guys
not having the math

36:27.885 --> 36:29.520
for what you're
trying to do here.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.494
What did you guys
just say to each other?

36:36.527 --> 36:38.029
Inside joke.

36:38.062 --> 36:39.697
All right. Joke's over.

36:39.730 --> 36:42.266
Tell him to put down
the goddamn chalk.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.470
I wouldn't, if I were you.

36:48.706 --> 36:49.874
Wait.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.680
This is incredible.

36:55.713 --> 36:58.583
What is?

36:58.616 --> 37:00.952
Don't you see it?

37:03.721 --> 37:04.789
May I?

37:29.513 --> 37:31.949
You're smart.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.551
For an American.

39:08.813 --> 39:12.550
Mother? Open sesame.

39:15.219 --> 39:17.421
Jack, my darling.

39:23.094 --> 39:26.597
Say something, I've missed
the sound of your voice.

39:26.630 --> 39:29.133
Are you ready?

39:29.166 --> 39:32.803
Come in for one moment,
I have a surprise for you.

39:34.939 --> 39:38.743
What kind of surprise?

39:38.776 --> 39:41.145
You're a Caltech man now.

39:41.178 --> 39:45.516
That must be commemorated.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.184
Guess which hand.

39:49.253 --> 39:50.554
You always guess right.

39:53.557 --> 39:57.528
That fob you wear ought to
be attached to something.

40:00.564 --> 40:03.167
Thank you.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.569
How much did you pay for it?

40:05.603 --> 40:08.072
None of your business.

40:08.105 --> 40:10.541
I won't be needing eight
place settings anytime soon.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.576
Besides, when we move
back to the big house,

40:12.610 --> 40:14.145
we can buy a new set.

40:17.715 --> 40:19.683
You spoil me.

40:19.717 --> 40:21.485
We have to keep up appearances.

40:21.519 --> 40:23.821
Especially around you-know-who.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.656
I thought we were past that.

40:25.689 --> 40:27.825
We'll never be past that.

40:27.858 --> 40:31.228
The best defense against
condescension is prosperity.

40:31.262 --> 40:34.565
Which is why one always
shows up bearing gifts.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.501
You know, Virgil hates it
when you bring flowers.

40:37.535 --> 40:38.669
He's allergic.

40:38.702 --> 40:39.770
Is he?

40:42.706 --> 40:46.243
My gosh! In front of
the whole department?

40:46.277 --> 40:47.412
Yeah.

40:47.413 --> 40:48.546
You didn't tell me this.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.080
Must've slipped my mind.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.558
There's been a lot of exciting
things happening.

40:51.582 --> 40:52.983
It's hard to keep track.

40:53.017 --> 40:55.686
We just had two geniuses
join our team.

40:55.719 --> 40:57.688
One of them comes all the way
from China.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.523
- How exotic.
- Patty. Elbows.

41:02.593 --> 41:04.962
Tell us more
about this talk you gave.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.764
It sounds fascinating.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.799
Well, all of GALCIT was there.

41:08.833 --> 41:12.036
Everybody was very keen
to hear about our work.

41:12.069 --> 41:13.313
Sorry, a-am I correct
in understanding

41:13.337 --> 41:15.639
that the-the university
is funding you

41:15.673 --> 41:18.776
to design a rocket
intended to reach the moon?

41:19.877 --> 41:21.979
That's the ultimate objective,
yes.

41:22.012 --> 41:23.781
Neat-o.

41:23.814 --> 41:25.850
That reminds me
of an article I read,

41:25.883 --> 41:29.720
some years ago,
about a man named, Goddard.

41:29.753 --> 41:33.057
Robert Goddard? He was an early
pioneer of the field.

41:33.090 --> 41:34.825
Yes, that's the one.

41:34.859 --> 41:36.260
What did he do?

41:36.293 --> 41:38.295
Goddard was the first
to successfully fire

41:38.329 --> 41:40.030
a liquid fueled rocket.

41:40.064 --> 41:41.298
I thought you were the first?

41:41.332 --> 41:42.967
No, I-I believe this man,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.736
Goddard beat Jack
by about ten years.

41:45.769 --> 41:47.771
Shared many of the same
aspirations, in fact.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.950
- That's right.
- Now, forgive me if-if I'm misremembering,

41:49.974 --> 41:51.559
Th-this was.

41:51.560 --> 41:53.143
The New York Times, mind you...

41:53.177 --> 41:55.913
And-and I know I'm no scientist

41:55.946 --> 41:57.848
like our man Jack, here...

41:57.882 --> 42:00.017
But this article
made it seem like

42:00.050 --> 42:02.720
those aspirations
were preposterous.

42:02.753 --> 42:05.189
That a rocket stood no chance of
working in outer space.

42:05.222 --> 42:07.625
Something to do with the lack
of air to push against.

42:07.658 --> 42:10.327
Well, Virgil, that criticism
grossly misunderstands.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.630
Newton's third law of motion:

42:12.663 --> 42:15.699
That for every action, there is
an equal and opposite reaction.

42:15.733 --> 42:17.067
S-So you consider yourself

42:17.101 --> 42:18.386
more of an expert than.

42:18.387 --> 42:19.670
The New York Times?

42:19.703 --> 42:21.171
When it comes to rockets, I do.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.873
So you truly do believe,

42:22.907 --> 42:24.341
that you, Jack Parsons,

42:24.375 --> 42:26.710
can build a ship
that will take us all

42:26.744 --> 42:27.912
to the moon?

42:27.945 --> 42:29.246
Yes.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.148
Where do you get such faith
in yourself?

42:31.181 --> 42:34.351
Where do you get
your faith in God?

42:34.385 --> 42:36.954
Well, see, the difference is,

42:36.987 --> 42:38.856
other people share my faith.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.229
Sorry.

42:46.797 --> 42:51.235
Now, Lucifer's original sin...

42:51.268 --> 42:53.237
was pride?

42:53.270 --> 42:56.373
Thinking that he was

42:56.407 --> 42:59.810
an equal of the Lord.

42:59.843 --> 43:01.979
Now, remember, Jack,
you are just a man,

43:02.012 --> 43:05.282
a man with responsibilities.

43:12.122 --> 43:14.191
So instead of attempting
the impossible,

43:14.224 --> 43:17.394
you should focus on
paying your mortgage.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.029
Susan, go and fetch
my checkbook.

43:19.063 --> 43:20.731
- Virgil.
- Now, I'm sorry.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.709
When I married into this family,
your mother was a widow

43:22.733 --> 43:24.401
and you were
a helpless young girl.

43:24.435 --> 43:27.037
I swore to ensure
your well-being,

43:27.071 --> 43:28.138
and when Jack married you,

43:28.172 --> 43:30.207
he assumed that obligation.

43:35.079 --> 43:38.916
We women can take better care
of ourselves than you think.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.986
Your father's money took care
of you, until it ran out.

43:44.355 --> 43:47.992
Now, I am making this out
to the bank,

43:48.025 --> 43:50.027
so don't you get any ideas.

43:50.060 --> 43:53.163
This is not a-a gift, mind you.

43:53.197 --> 43:55.065
This is a loan.

43:55.099 --> 43:58.202
It's time you two
started facing...

43:59.937 --> 44:01.672
reality.

44:14.785 --> 44:17.054
Don't let what he said
get to you.

44:17.087 --> 44:20.057
He's just jealous.

44:20.090 --> 44:21.925
It's true.

44:21.959 --> 44:25.162
He thinks he's smarter
than everyone.

44:25.195 --> 44:28.165
It needles him to know
an actual genius.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.137
Did you know?

44:33.170 --> 44:35.239
Know what?

44:39.209 --> 44:41.779
He said he just wanted to talk.

44:46.116 --> 44:48.919
We don't have to deposit the
check, if you don't want to.

45:23.153 --> 45:25.389
Wait there.

46:20.511 --> 46:22.388
You're right, okay?! I'm not
the man I thought I'd be

46:22.412 --> 46:24.581
when I was
eight fucking years old!

46:24.615 --> 46:26.116
No one is!

46:26.150 --> 46:28.852
You get married.
You get responsibilities.

46:28.886 --> 46:30.854
We can't all be like you.

46:34.158 --> 46:36.293
You can be exactly like me.

46:36.326 --> 46:39.596
You just need to have
an open mind.

46:39.630 --> 46:42.466
Jack, please come inside.

46:48.005 --> 46:50.407
How many miles to Babylon?

46:53.076 --> 46:55.045
What did you just say?

46:55.078 --> 46:58.081
I heard it's three score
and ten.

46:58.115 --> 47:00.484
How the fuck
did you know about that?

47:02.953 --> 47:06.156
That wasn't written
in any of my notebooks.

47:06.190 --> 47:08.559
No. It wasn't.

47:08.592 --> 47:12.362
So how did you know?!

47:14.364 --> 47:16.066
Magick.
