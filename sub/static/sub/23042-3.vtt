Lincoln Park High won the last
nine out of ten Red North meets.

10:37.797 --> 10:40.380
Ain't no way we're not
gonna beat them.

10:40.380 --> 10:41.839
Nine out of ten,
which means they lost one

10:41.839 --> 10:44.338
- and could lose again.
- Hey, y'all.

10:44.338 --> 10:47.463
Look like somebody on
the struggle bus this morning.

10:47.463 --> 10:49.296
I didn't sleep well.

10:49.296 --> 10:50.338
He nervous about that play.

10:50.338 --> 10:51.380
Play, what play?

10:51.380 --> 10:53.630
My baby in a play?

10:53.630 --> 10:56.005
The Wiz,  he auditioned for it.

10:56.005 --> 10:57.046
The Wiz,  really?
That's good.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.839
Well, then put your marker in.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.672

11:08.672 --> 11:11.714

to your sister like that.

11:11.714 --> 11:14.755
- Morning, babe.
- Morning.

11:14.755 --> 11:15.922

11:21.213 --> 11:21.922
Nothing.

11:21.922 --> 11:24.088

Look, the reason I didn't
tell y'all about the play

11:37.922 --> 11:40.505

13:36.797 --> 13:37.797
You know, I stopped
by the house yesterday,

13:37.797 --> 13:39.588
and she was saying something

13:39.588 --> 13:40.839
about her selling the house
or something like that.

13:42.672 --> 13:45.338

13:45.338 --> 13:47.130
whatever she about to do,
she about to fuck it up.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.296
- So...
- She ain't thinking straight.

13:48.296 --> 13:51.714
Exactly, which is why
I was thinking maybe you could,

13:51.714 --> 13:54.463
you know, stop over there
and talk to her.

13:54.463 --> 13:55.296
See if she signed anything.

- Okay, look.

21:52.296 --> 21:54.463

being built ten minutes away

21:54.463 --> 21:55.338

22:20.338 --> 22:21.964

the best thing

22:21.964 --> 22:23.714

22:23.714 --> 22:25.672

straight through the money,

22:25.672 --> 22:26.547

she gonna be knocking at.

22:26.547 --> 22:29.672
