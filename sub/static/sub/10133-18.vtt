[sighs]

17:13.449 --> 17:15.869
Michelle, what are you

17:13.449 --> 17:15.869
doing in here?

17:15.910 --> 17:18.496
What are you doing in here?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.081
Is this what you do every day

17:18.538 --> 17:21.081
when I leave for school?

17:21.123 --> 17:23.334
Sneak in here

17:21.123 --> 17:23.334
and play with my toys?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.127
Every day.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.173
Michelle, listen to me.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.718
I'm ditching school because

17:29.215 --> 17:31.718
I'm not taking my class picture

17:31.759 --> 17:33.720
with this thing on my nose.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.889
But you can't tell

17:33.761 --> 17:35.889
anyone I'm home.

17:35.930 --> 17:39.183
- Pinky swear?

17:35.930 --> 17:39.183
- Pinky swear.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.269
Okay, now.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.897
You have to do me a favor.

17:43.938 --> 17:47.483
Go downstairs to the kitchen

17:43.938 --> 17:47.483
and get me something to eat.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.277
And if anyone asks

17:47.525 --> 17:50.277
who the food is for

17:50.319 --> 17:53.072
you say, nobody.

17:53.113 --> 17:56.034
- Got it?

17:53.113 --> 17:56.034
- Got it, dude.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.552
[scoffs]

18:24.729 --> 18:26.773
Mm. I'm a good cook.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.485
Michelle,

18:28.900 --> 18:31.485
you just ate breakfast.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.198
This is not for me.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.868
- Well, then who is it for?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.868
- Nobody.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.378
Michelle, this sandwich

18:47.001 --> 18:49.378
is inside out.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.758
You're supposed

18:51.130 --> 18:53.758
to say, thank you.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.428
- 'Michelle!'

18:55.051 --> 18:57.428
- Oh, no. It's Joey.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.430
Remember, I'm not here.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.312
Oh, Michelle. You are gonna make

19:03.559 --> 19:06.312
such a mess up here.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.897
Too late.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.027
- 'Hey.'

19:10.900 --> 19:13.027
- Uh-oh.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.325
Hey, you, doggy.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.325
That's for nobody.

[sighs]

19:27.834 --> 19:29.418
Oh, hi, Joey.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.130

19:29.460 --> 19:32.130

19:32.171 --> 19:33.464
Out.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.927
Steph, why aren't you in school?

19:37.969 --> 19:41.097
Joey, please don't make me

19:37.969 --> 19:41.097
go to school like this.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.641
You already broke my nose on TV.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.769
Now you're gonna make me

19:43.683 --> 19:46.769
be teased for a whole year?

19:46.811 --> 19:48.437
What did I ever do to you?

19:48.479 --> 19:50.439
All I did was love you.

19:52.150 --> 19:55.028
Oh, you never have to

19:52.150 --> 19:55.028
go to school again.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.282
Stephanie, what are you

19:58.572 --> 20:00.282
doing here?

20:00.324 --> 20:03.911
Joey says I never have to

20:00.324 --> 20:03.911
go to school again!

20:03.953 --> 20:05.371
Jess, look,

20:03.953 --> 20:05.371
she's way too embarrassed

20:05.412 --> 20:07.040
to get her picture

20:05.412 --> 20:07.040
taken like this.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.709
We'll write her a little note,

20:07.081 --> 20:09.709
Danny will never know.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.085
Works for me.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.589
Now, Stephanie.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.801
Pal, you're only in

20:15.631 --> 20:18.801
the second grade once..

20:18.843 --> 20:20.344
...hopefully.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.846
Now, a class picture

20:20.386 --> 20:21.846
is something

20:21.888 --> 20:23.556
you can treasure forever.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.558
If you miss that picture,

20:23.597 --> 20:25.558
you may regret it

20:25.599 --> 20:28.186
for the rest of your life.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.771
I'm willing to take that chance.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.357
Let me put it another way.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.357
You're going to school.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.068
- But, Uncle--

20:33.399 --> 20:35.068
- I don't want any buts.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.485
Now, go downstairs

20:35.109 --> 20:36.485
and wait for me.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.863
- Okay, I'll go.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.863
- Alright.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.492
But I'm not gonna smile.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.039
- This is all my fault.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.039
- Yes, it is.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.374
- Thanks for the pep talk.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.374
- Come on, Joey, grow up, man.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.543
Feeling guilty's not gonna

20:50.416 --> 20:52.543
help anybody.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.671
Oh, great, now I'm feeling

20:52.585 --> 20:55.671
guilty about feeling guilty.

20:55.713 --> 20:59.092
Joseph, snap out of it.

20:55.713 --> 20:59.092
You're a comedian.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.052
You're supposed to make people

20:59.133 --> 21:01.052
laugh at their troubles.

21:01.094 --> 21:04.346
There's a little girl downstairs

21:01.094 --> 21:04.346
who I know could use a laugh.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.182
Ain't you gonna go down there

21:04.388 --> 21:06.182
and take care of business

21:06.224 --> 21:08.893
or you're gonna stay up here

21:06.224 --> 21:08.893
and wallow in your self-pity?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.561
Just give me one more wallow.

[instrumental music]

21:19.946 --> 21:22.198
- Joey, what are you doing here?

21:19.946 --> 21:22.198

21:22.240 --> 21:24.324
Come on, everybody's ready

21:22.240 --> 21:24.324
to take the class picture.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.203
Do I have to?

21:24.366 --> 21:27.203
I'm gonna look so silly.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.537
You're not gonna look

21:27.245 --> 21:28.537
any sillier

21:28.579 --> 21:30.123
than the rest of the class.

21:32.083 --> 21:35.169
(all)

21:32.083 --> 21:35.169
Hi, Stephanie.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.755
Alright. This is great.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.800
And I got you a pair too.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.800
Now, go take that picture.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.010
Thanks, Mr. Egghead.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.096
- Thanks, Professor.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.096
- Hmm.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.432
Joseph, this is one

21:46.305 --> 21:48.432
of the stupidest ideas

21:48.474 --> 21:51.518
you've ever had..

21:48.474 --> 21:51.518
And one of the best.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.728
Good job.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.981
Okay, everybody.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.981
One, two, three, smile.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.151
And now one without the glasses.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.866
Yeah, what the heck.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.952
Alright, everyone

22:05.908 --> 22:07.952
say the secret word

22:07.994 --> 22:09.536
and of course,
