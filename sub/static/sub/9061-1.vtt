We did not think that karting
could become a career.

AYRTON'S FATHER
MILTON DA SILVA

01:36.800 --> 01:40.270
But it has become a
big part of our lives

01:40.480 --> 01:46.471
and we are a bit worried because
then along came Formula One.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.038
May God protect him forever.

01:49.238 --> 01:50.239
AYRTON'S MOTHER
NEYDE SENNA

01:50.240 --> 01:52.959
All the dangers are my biggest fear.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.032
I would like to thank him
because he is a good son

01:56.120 --> 02:00.955
and this year he has worked
very hard and honestly.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.194
For me, it is more important than any title.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.152
The time has come.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.074
Ayrton is ready to ride in a Formula
One car for the first time.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.758
I believe it was God
who gave me this opportunity,

02:47.960 --> 02:50.838
I've been waiting for a long time.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.590
And now it is helpful
to remain calm, tranquil, relaxed.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.670
Ayrton, this is a beautiful city,

06:33.760 --> 06:37.435
with wonderful streets to walk,
but unsuitable to host a race, no?

06:37.520 --> 06:38.555
REGINALDO LEME

06:39.240 --> 06:41.470
Indeed. I arrived at the last minute

06:41.680 --> 06:44.148
and I was surprised.
I've never been to Monaco.

06:44.480 --> 06:47.438
I did some testing

06:47.520 --> 06:51.513
and fortunately, I managed
to adapt to the track.

06:51.920 --> 06:56.357
There is no margin for error,
any error would result in an accident.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.358
But for now, I'm satisfied.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.671
I was travelling a lot, as a
Formula One journalist

07:04.760 --> 07:07.672
when Ayrton began to be noticed
driving a Toleman.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.991
Toleman was not a winning team.

07:14.320 --> 07:20.070
The car was bad and never won a race.

07:20.400 --> 07:25.713
That's why what Ayrton did in Monaco
was true genius.

VOICE OF JAMES HUNT
1976 FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPION

10:34.360 --> 10:36.157
Incredible!

10:40.920 --> 10:44.117
Ayrton raises his arms
and gestures with enthusiasm!

10:44.440 --> 10:47.512
Celebrating as if he won the race!

10:47.800 --> 10:49.836
If we had continued for a few more laps,

10:50.440 --> 10:54.149
I am sure Ayrton would have passed him.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.276
I had a serious chance of winning.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.677
But until you cross the finishing line
in first position,

11:01.800 --> 11:02.994
it is impossible to make a prediction.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.675
Formula One is politics, money

11:07.120 --> 11:10.795
and while you are making your way through it,
you must deal with such things.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.797
Ayrton Senna
the new star of Formula One!

12:33.840 --> 12:36.308

AYRTON'S MOTHER
NEYDA SENNA

15:18.960 --> 15:22.191
For example, he always paid attention
in the classroom at school,

15:22.400 --> 15:24.834
so he didn't have to study at home

15:24.920 --> 15:28.708
and so he had more time
to play on his go-kart.

REGINALDO LEME
GLOBO TV COMMENTATOR

16:25.440 --> 16:30.434
When the conditions were bad
and the track became slippery

16:30.520 --> 16:31.919
he had a higher gear.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.870
The Estoril race was incredible.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.110
He lapped all his opponents except one.

16:55.120 --> 16:58.476
It is wonderful!
An extraordinary feeling.

16:59.480 --> 17:03.359
I am very happy because,
in my second year in Formula One,

17:03.680 --> 17:07.150
I managed to fulfill my first dream,
which was to win my first Grand Prix.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.231
It is something unique.

17:32.600 --> 17:36.513
It was raining really hard.
There was no competition, really.

17:36.600 --> 17:42.232
He would have won that race if it was run 100 times.

17:42.320 --> 17:46.233
It was an important race for
Brazil for many reasons,

17:46.320 --> 17:50.074
including the fact that on that day,

17:50.160 --> 17:56.471
the first elected Brazilian President,
Tancredo Neves, died.

17:56.560 --> 18:00.075
It was a very important
political moment for Brazil,

18:00.160 --> 18:02.594
because he was the first elected president

18:02.680 --> 18:05.672
after the end of the dictatorship.

18:05.760 --> 18:09.912
He was ill for a long time and died.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.915
There was a risk that Brazil
would suffer another blow

18:15.000 --> 18:17.992
or something like that, which nobody wanted.

18:18.080 --> 18:22.596
Senna's win was very important
in that sense,

18:22.680 --> 18:27.231
for the public, for the Brazilian people
and for us there,

18:27.320 --> 18:31.950
and I'm sure he also realised this
later in the evening

18:32.040 --> 18:35.316
when we were at dinner. We went to dinner,

18:35.400 --> 18:39.359
but later that night after leaving the
restaurant he caught a plane to return to Brazil.

18:52.640 --> 18:56.838
I think many Japanese girls are fans of Mr. Senna.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.679
Now I am close to him
and I'm so nervous...

21:34.680 --> 21:41.430
At that time the strongest teams
were Williams and McLaren.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.590
McLaren was,

21:45.280 --> 21:48.716
I would say, a constructor
which had always reflected

21:49.000 --> 21:50.877
the same values as Ayrton.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.236
In that sense Ayrton and Ron Dennis
had much in common.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.835
They were both perfectionists...

21:57.960 --> 22:00.235
Let's put it like this. Both have

22:00.320 --> 22:06.156
the idea that nothing will go wrong
if something is well planned and executed

22:06.240 --> 22:09.630
and have always fought
by the same ideals.

22:09.720 --> 22:15.436
Ron comes from a background of hard work.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.630
He has struggled to get where he is now

22:17.720 --> 22:21.395
and has been successful in life.
They are both very close.

22:21.680 --> 22:27.789
At that time the trilogy "The best
team, best driver, best car"

22:27.880 --> 22:31.350
was led by Ron Dennis at McLaren.

WOGAN TALK SHOW, BBC

26:07.440 --> 26:13.672
In Formula One your teammate
is your biggest rival,

26:13.800 --> 26:16.837
the first person to beat

26:16.960 --> 26:20.111
because he is the only one who
has a car equal to your own.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.749
I can have the excuse that I run in the
McLaren and the Ferrari is better

26:23.840 --> 26:27.116
or I can be in the Ferrari when the
McLaren is better, but I can't say

26:27.200 --> 26:32.269
that my Ferrari is different
from that of my teammate.

26:32.400 --> 26:36.633
Usually early in his career

26:36.720 --> 26:38.950
when a driver arrives in a team

26:39.040 --> 26:41.793
his main rival is his teammate.

26:41.880 --> 26:47.231
If he goes fatster than his
teammate has a chance to move on.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.914
If he doesn't accomplish this,
it's the end of his career.

AYRTON'S SISTER

28:04.760 --> 28:06.512
He was very nervous.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.516
It was as if he bore the weight
of the world on his shoulders

28:11.080 --> 28:15.756
because he now had the responsibility

28:15.880 --> 28:20.237
to demonstrate he was
a first rate driver.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.956
Before Senna arrived at McLaren

28:24.040 --> 28:28.556
Alain Prost was considered the destroyer
of teammates.

28:28.640 --> 28:33.159
I remember Jo Ramirez said to me:

28:33.240 --> 28:35.549
"Reginald, I am very concerned

28:35.640 --> 28:39.030
"What will happen
with Ayrton at McLaren.

28:39.120 --> 28:44.950
"I know he has talent,
but Prost is a fighter,

28:45.040 --> 28:48.237
"He creates an atmosphere of war

28:48.320 --> 28:50.550
"Which helps him to destroy his opponents,

28:50.640 --> 28:53.712
"As he did with Keke Rosberg."

28:53.800 --> 28:57.156
Using the word "destroy"
in the technical sense.

28:57.240 --> 29:02.993
Destroyed on the track,
beating his opponent mentally.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.674
I said to Jo Ramirez:

29:05.760 --> 29:07.671
"Jo, with Senna it will be different.

29:07.760 --> 29:12.199
"Because he has more
talent than the other drivers

29:12.280 --> 29:15.078
"Prost will look to divide the team."

29:15.160 --> 29:17.071
And that's what happened.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.151
Alain Prost was scared.

29:19.240 --> 29:23.789
Despite all that Prost had
in terms of talent,

29:23.880 --> 29:26.792
understanding of a race, intelligence

29:26.880 --> 29:29.917
and cold blood, he was surprised

29:30.000 --> 29:32.912
when he began racing with Ayrton.
He would never have thought

29:33.040 --> 29:35.554
a driver could be as good as Ayrton was.

It is one of the few things
that we can still be proud of.

42:30.760 --> 42:34.309
Once, I asked Ayrton
"When will you think about quitting?"

42:34.400 --> 42:37.597
He said, "Mum, the day I am
the champion I will stop."

42:37.800 --> 42:41.031

I think everybody is excited,

45:17.200 --> 45:19.839
It is curious

45:19.920 --> 45:24.198
that the English term "teammate"
is translated into the Portuguese "companheiros de equipe".

45:24.280 --> 45:28.114
I've often used the term
"Enemies of the team".

45:28.200 --> 45:34.710
Because if you have two drivers, as
in the case Prost and Ayrton,

45:34.800 --> 45:41.713
as teammates, inevitably
internal strife will arise.

The order of the grid is always one or the other.

48:58.720 --> 48:59.948
It is a war between them.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.638
For the French driver Alain Prost,

49:01.720 --> 49:04.837
he believes his teammate is unfair to him.

49:04.960 --> 49:09.712
and these disagreements could
affect the rest of the season.

49:12.160 --> 49:15.789
Grand Prix after Grand Prix they were
more and more distant from each other.

"He wants war."

49:22.240 --> 49:23.559

59:32.480 --> 59:35.631
at the Grand Prix of Japan

59:35.720 --> 59:38.757
is to exclude the number one car

After the race, a giant screen has

Instead of trying

The rivalry between Ayrton and Prost

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.155
is the biggest rivalry I've ever seen in sports

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:45.997

It was a rivalry involving everything.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:04.357
There were criticisms,

in the history of Formula One

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.993

Championship ruined.

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.277
They accuse each other,

His reaction was violent.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.834
Mansell goes straight on!

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.515
The Championship is over.
Mansell cannot get out of the gravel trap.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:35.715
AYRTON SENNA
three-time WORLD CHAMPION

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:41.432
Ayrton Senna of Brazil,
three-time Formula One World Champion!

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:46.351
A lifetime dedicated to this moment

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.956
by a genius of international sport.

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:54.077
Three-time world champion
and many other titles ahead of him.

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.196
And only 31 years of age.

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.955
Thirty three wins, three world titles.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:04.909
Breaking record after record.
He celebrates as only Senna can do.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:10.512
The third world title puts Senna
amongst the greatest of all time.

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.437
It is very special for me.

01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.039
Thank you so much.

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:41.389
SAO PAULO
5th NOVEMBER 1991

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:47.478
I followed Senna, walked with him

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.275
on the streets of many countries around the world,

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:57.195
in particular to get to the circuits, such as in Japan,

01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:01.950
where there is a one kilometer walk to reach the hotel

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:05.675
and to reach the circuit you
must cross an amusement park

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:12.029
And I thought: "How can a person
be worshipped in this way?"

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:16.159
It was a worship without limits.

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:36.717
I kissed the hands of Senna, the left hand
of Senna, three-times world champion.

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:41.271
I want to see Senna.
I want to hug him and kiss him.

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.351
I have got a box with
photos and newspaper articles.

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.038
Everything you can imagine.

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.549
He is the only good thing in Brazil, right?

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.708
It is a wonderful party.

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:17.917
Anything goes. What matters is happiness.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.156
Have you spoken about Formula One today?

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.755
Formula One is too rigid.
Today is Carnival.

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:34.433
Have any of your girls
ever told you: "Faster, Ayrton?"

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.079
Yes.

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.351
Ayrton acheiving the third world title

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:48.830
was the culmination of a script
he had written for himself

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.672
well before entering Formula One,

01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.116
because he knew he could do it
and could do even more.

01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:58.230
The great idol of sport in Brazil.

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.755
With the third title, he became
the world's great sporting idol.

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:30.355
NIGEL MANSELL WORLD CHAMPION 1992

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:44.553
The negotiations were lengthy

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:47.438
and we still do not know who will be
Prost's teammate.

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.035
The three-time world champion has signed

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.917
a two-year contract with Williams

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.195
and during the week
will begin testing the car.

VOICE OF ALAIN PROST

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:07.154
I'm pretty sure of one thing:

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.152
I'm the one that has more to lose.

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:19.239
Because I'm at an age near the peak of my career

01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:24.235
and the number of years in the career
of a Formula One driver is limited.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:31.830
So if I stop, I'd lose out
more than anyone else,

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:35.270
both professionally and personally.

01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:40.999
ADRIANE GALISTEU

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.597
In 1993, Ayrton drove
his car so brilliantly.

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.591
For me, it was his best season.

MONACO GRAND PRIX

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.629
Ayrton fought so hard to win at
Monaco, but did not make it,

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:14.118
fought to win at Suzuka, but did not make it,

01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:18.193
and when he was struggling to get into Williams

01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:21.590
he thought it was  the end of his career.

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:25.998
Sometimes it makes no sense... We always say

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:30.676
that we must fight for our ideals,
for what we want out of life.

01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:35.709
But sometimes the battles
do not bring the desired results.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF WILLIAMS DRIVERS

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.437
For Ayrton Senna, it is
a race against time.

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:51.558
He has to attune himself to be an integral
part of the team and adapt to the new car.

01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:54.518
He says he is not yet comfortable.

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:59.276
The car no longer has the electronic
components used last year.

01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:03.914
He is without traction control, special
brakes and active suspension.

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:09.717
The cars are much less stable

01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:13.873
without the electronically controlled suspension.

01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:17.919
As a result, they are more difficult to drive

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:23.394
and it is very likely that more cars will leave the track.

01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:28.716
So we might see more cars crashing,
giving more excitement to the audience.

01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:31.554
Also for us, as long as nothing happens to the drivers.

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:35.235
Otherwise, it is not a good situation.

even for a moment.

02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:11.358

Do you know Ayrton
or should I introduce you?

02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:51.118
We met four years earlier. I already met him.

02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:53.196
Knew him by name, or in person?

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:58.631
I know him because I follow
Formula One and then we met in person.

02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:00.876
Why are you so nervous, then?

02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:05.471
When we stand next to a person like
him we always become emotional.

02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:10.072

and the future champion.

GLOBE F1 COMMENTATOR

02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:13.638
That Saturday, at dinner,
Frank Williams was not at all sure

02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:15.278
that Senna would be present on the grid.

02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:21.993
I was sure that he did not want to compete.

02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:35.079
The last time I saw Ayrton
was that Sunday.

02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:37.191
He was very agitated.

02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:40.158
Some friends went to talk to him.

02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:43.915
He was very agitated, was going from
the Williams motor home to the pits.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:50.959
Back and forth. Before I take my
position in the commentary box,

02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:55.238
I always ask questions about strategy to

02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:59.069
Brazilian drivers
and others who are near.

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:00.912
Some respond, others do not

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:05.119
but they reveal some information

02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:07.839
I can report to the public
during the race.

02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:13.199
I expected to be able to ask Ayrton
some questions, but could not.

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:16.477
I realized that this was not the time
for such an interview.

02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:21.955
SUNDAY
1st MAY 1994

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:03.188
That morning when I awoke,

02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:05.077
God asked me to speak to him.

VIVIANE SENNA
AYRTON'S SISTER

02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:10.674
He opened the Bible and
read a passage that said

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:15.788
God would give him
the greatest gift of all,

02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:20.590
that of God himself.

02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:26.390
A collision.

02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:29.631
Everyone swerves around. Look.

02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:33.390
Lamy arrives at full speed.

SAFETY CAR

02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:12.918
They told me that Ayrton had confessed to
someone before the race

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.754
that he would carry an Austrian flag in his overalls.

02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:21.997
In victory, or if he was
on the podium, which was very likely,

02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:26.910
he wanted to show the flag
as a tribute to Roland Ratzenberger.

02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:33.034
Lights out on the safety car.

02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:36.516
It means that the safety car
is about to come into the pits.

02:16:40.719 --> 02:16:43.553
Starting again. Senna is in the lead.

02:16:43.879 --> 02:16:45.199
Schumacher is second.

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:57.075

In my opinion,
the steering column broke

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.877
and the car became uncontrollable.

02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:16.154
But above all, it was inevitable

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:22.270
because the car crashed
at such an angle. The suspension arm

02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:24.032
went into his helmet.
