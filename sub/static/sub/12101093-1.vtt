WEBVTT

00:03.926 --> 00:05.696
APS Films.

00:18.875 --> 00:20.810
Hi, sorry to do this.

00:20.843 --> 00:24.881
I know it's against the
rules of this whole thing,

00:24.914 --> 00:27.718
but I just wanted to take
one second of your time.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.886
My name's Logan Clark
and I made a movie

00:29.919 --> 00:33.791
that I am so proud of and I
really think you'd like it.

00:33.824 --> 00:35.893
And I would love to
share it with you.

00:35.925 --> 00:38.629
It's about a guy making
his way in the world.

00:38.662 --> 00:41.665
There's relationship drama
and his friends are so funny.

00:41.697 --> 00:46.069
The whole cast is super
talented and it looks amazing.

00:46.102 --> 00:49.739
I mean, honestly, I put
everything I have into this

00:49.773 --> 00:52.876
and I know that you're
probably skeptical

00:52.910 --> 00:56.113
because it is an indie film but-

00:56.145 --> 00:57.981
- Wait.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.849
Are you talking to me?

00:59.882 --> 01:00.584
Yeah.

01:00.617 --> 01:01.684
Sorry.

01:01.718 --> 01:03.721
I'm better at directing
than pitching.

01:03.754 --> 01:04.555
Should I?

01:04.588 --> 01:05.623
I should start over?

01:05.656 --> 01:06.457
Start over.

01:06.490 --> 01:07.925
No, no, you're good.

01:07.957 --> 01:10.660
Why don't you tell
me what those are?

01:10.693 --> 01:12.897
Oh, these are panko
crusted crab cakes

01:12.930 --> 01:15.967
with a roasted
pepper chive aioli.

01:17.668 --> 01:18.636
Always loved aioli.

01:18.668 --> 01:19.869
Never figured out what it is.

01:19.903 --> 01:21.205
It's just mayonnaise.

01:21.237 --> 01:22.138
It's not just mayonnaise.

01:22.171 --> 01:23.706
No, it's not just mayonnaise.

01:23.740 --> 01:25.142
So you made a movie.

01:25.174 --> 01:26.109
Is it scary?

01:26.142 --> 01:27.912
No, it's indie comedy.

01:27.945 --> 01:29.946
It's not really
laugh driven though.

01:29.980 --> 01:30.880
No laughs.

01:30.913 --> 01:32.016
Well they're contextual.

01:32.049 --> 01:33.150
When's it come out?

01:33.183 --> 01:34.585
TBD.

01:34.618 --> 01:35.786
We submitted to a
bunch of festivals,

01:35.818 --> 01:37.520
so we're just waiting to hear.

01:37.553 --> 01:39.457
And you know, I was
hoping maybe you

01:39.490 --> 01:40.991
or one of the other agents.

01:41.023 --> 01:41.959
How'd you know I was an agent?

01:41.992 --> 01:45.029
All the caterers know
who the agents are.

01:45.061 --> 01:46.096
I hope you don't
mind me pitching.

01:46.129 --> 01:47.665
Oh, what are you pitching?

01:47.698 --> 01:50.868
The crab cakes I hope.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.837
Is everything okay here?

01:52.870 --> 01:53.904
Yeah.

01:53.936 --> 01:55.939
These fucking rock.

01:55.972 --> 01:57.474
Oh wonderful.

01:57.508 --> 01:58.108
Thank you.

01:58.141 --> 01:59.076
Enjoy.

01:59.109 --> 02:00.845
Logan, we need you upfront.

02:00.877 --> 02:01.712
Yeah.

02:02.812 --> 02:04.013
Ah.

02:04.046 --> 02:05.648
Sorry, I feel like
I flubbed this.

02:05.681 --> 02:07.684
- Let me take it from the top.
- Okay, rule of thumb.

02:07.718 --> 02:10.019
You should be able to pitch
a movie in 10 syllables.

02:10.053 --> 02:10.954
Oh, okay.

02:13.524 --> 02:16.160
Relationship with this guy who-

02:16.192 --> 02:16.993
- No, it's too long.

02:17.026 --> 02:18.228
Try this.

02:18.262 --> 02:20.898
Woman gets trapped
on a treadmill.

02:23.267 --> 02:24.101
Dreadmill.

02:25.234 --> 02:26.769
Did you just
come up with that?

02:26.803 --> 02:28.772
No, that's the movie
this whole party's for.

02:28.804 --> 02:32.843
That's the dumbest
idea I've ever heard.

02:32.875 --> 02:35.745
No, that's a $9,000 budget
that's gonna make 38 millions.

02:35.779 --> 02:36.680
It's genius.

02:36.713 --> 02:38.816
They put hot sauce on this?

02:38.849 --> 02:40.049
Cholula.

02:40.083 --> 02:43.587
Look, how honest do you want
me to be with you right now?

02:43.619 --> 02:44.788
Very honest.

02:46.889 --> 02:48.692
No one gives a shit.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.595
About you.

02:52.629 --> 02:53.964
This isn't to hurt
your feelings.

02:53.996 --> 02:54.831
This is just reality.

02:54.864 --> 02:57.267
Like no one's impressed
by your ambition

02:57.300 --> 02:59.102
or that you made a movie
or what you put into it

02:59.136 --> 03:01.704
'cause everybody says
that and nobody knows you.

03:01.738 --> 03:02.973
And no one wants
to sell your film

03:03.006 --> 03:06.243
unless it sells
itself like Dreadmill.

03:06.275 --> 03:09.012
Honestly, the best
advice I could give you

03:09.046 --> 03:10.281
is to take everything
you've learned

03:10.314 --> 03:14.150
about show business and
start flipping houses.

03:17.087 --> 03:20.323
But if I could just get you
to watch it, I do have a link.

03:20.357 --> 03:23.127
I need you to leave that man.

03:25.095 --> 03:28.299
Look, if it gets into a
reputable festival and wins,

03:28.332 --> 03:31.268
hit me up and I'll try to
get my boss to watch it.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.838
Sucks on this side too, man.

03:35.172 --> 03:36.007
Wait.

03:37.073 --> 03:38.942
Let me help you out.

03:41.712 --> 03:42.312
Pop pop.

03:42.345 --> 03:44.081
Uh oh.

03:44.113 --> 03:45.081
Logan.

03:45.114 --> 03:46.983
Toni, I'm sorry.

03:47.017 --> 03:49.353
You are on busing and trash
for the rest of the night.

03:49.386 --> 03:52.022
And if I see you harass
another guest, you're gone.

03:52.054 --> 03:52.956
Okay, I was just-

03:52.989 --> 03:55.291
- Serving yourself
instead of crab cakes.

03:55.325 --> 03:56.260
Yeah, I know.

03:56.292 --> 03:57.861
And I'm getting complaints.

03:57.893 --> 03:59.796
Look Logan, we all
have our things.

03:59.829 --> 04:01.165
Okay, my TikTok's blowing up,

04:01.197 --> 04:02.599
but you don't see
me talking about it.

04:02.632 --> 04:03.833
That would be sad.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.636
You cannot walk
around talking about

04:05.668 --> 04:07.971
some movie you
wanna make some day.

04:08.005 --> 04:09.607
Toni, I already made it.

04:09.639 --> 04:11.308
Oh, congratulations.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.879
Now you have time to
take out the trash.

04:30.861 --> 04:33.130
Tell me you have good news.

04:33.163 --> 04:34.165
We got in.

04:36.399 --> 04:38.001
I figured that's
what this was about.

04:38.034 --> 04:38.835
Okay.

04:38.868 --> 04:40.070
Where, Sundance?

04:40.103 --> 04:42.940
No, not Sundance, but
better if you ask me.

04:42.973 --> 04:46.711
So we didn't get into
Sundance?

04:47.444 --> 04:49.079
Jesus, come on already.

04:49.111 --> 04:52.048
We have been officially
selected to premiere our movie

04:52.082 --> 04:56.754
at the Hollywilde International
Film Festival of Cinema.

04:59.221 --> 05:00.890
The what?

05:00.923 --> 05:03.060
A festival in the forest
reserves, cabin country.

05:03.092 --> 05:05.962
The best kept secret in the biz.

05:07.329 --> 05:10.034
You said better than Sundance.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.869
They close deals there.

05:11.901 --> 05:14.404
International
distribution, Logan.

05:14.437 --> 05:15.305
They want our premiere?

05:15.337 --> 05:16.139
Yeah.

05:16.173 --> 05:17.074
Fuck that.

05:17.106 --> 05:18.041
We'll wait for something better.

05:18.075 --> 05:19.709
We can't wait.

05:19.743 --> 05:21.178
Okay.

05:21.211 --> 05:22.913
We gotta pay our investors
back, otherwise we're fucked.

05:22.945 --> 05:23.780
Okay?

05:26.315 --> 05:28.385
Also, I already accepted.

05:28.418 --> 05:29.219
What?

05:29.252 --> 05:30.087
We already agreed.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.120
You are the show.

05:31.154 --> 05:31.988
I am the business.

05:32.022 --> 05:33.457
This is business.

05:33.490 --> 05:34.425
You didn't even ask.

05:34.457 --> 05:35.958
Because I knew
that you were gonna-

05:35.991 --> 05:36.993
- Fuck.

05:37.026 --> 05:37.827
Okay, okay, okay.

05:37.861 --> 05:38.762
Hey, you're okay.

05:38.795 --> 05:40.698
Hey, you want an old fashioned?

05:40.731 --> 05:42.433
Hey, can we get someone
to get an old fashioned

05:42.466 --> 05:44.300
for my friend please?

05:44.334 --> 05:45.235
Fuck.

05:45.267 --> 05:47.437
Logan, Logan, come here.

05:47.471 --> 05:48.839
This is a win.

05:49.772 --> 05:51.708
No, it's not.

05:51.741 --> 05:57.180
This is a compromise, but
that's all it ever is with me.

05:57.214 --> 05:58.149
Right?

05:58.182 --> 06:00.818
It's either a flat out
no or a compromise.

06:00.851 --> 06:05.089
I am so sick of watching
everyone around me make it

06:06.123 --> 06:08.291
while I serve them drinks.

06:10.192 --> 06:13.464
This was supposed to be
my ticket into the club

06:13.497 --> 06:18.235
where producers asked me
what I want to make next.

06:18.267 --> 06:19.335
Have a blast.

06:34.851 --> 06:37.053
They want the premiere.

06:37.087 --> 06:39.288
So then why not
give him the premiere?

06:39.322 --> 06:40.990
Because it's the premiere.

06:41.024 --> 06:43.093
It's like your only
bargaining chip.

06:43.125 --> 06:47.231
Yeah, but aren't they
the only ones who've asked?

06:47.264 --> 06:48.165
Was that offensive?

06:48.197 --> 06:49.233
You don't get it, babe.

06:49.265 --> 06:50.166
You're a lawyer.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.834
Hollywood is cutthroat.

06:51.868 --> 06:54.437
And these film festivals, they
can make or break careers.

06:54.471 --> 06:56.240
But if it doesn't
work, that's it.

06:56.272 --> 06:57.340
It's over.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.175
It's like a house that's
been on the market too long.

06:59.209 --> 07:00.476
Nobody wants to buy that shit.

07:00.510 --> 07:02.178
They're like something bad
happened in that house.

07:02.212 --> 07:03.312
I know something bad.

07:03.346 --> 07:04.815
Somebody was murdered
in that house.

07:04.848 --> 07:07.017
And if I move in there,
me and my family are next

07:07.050 --> 07:08.352
because that house is cursed.

07:08.385 --> 07:09.553
And that's-

07:09.586 --> 07:11.788
- If there is only
one offer on the table

07:11.822 --> 07:16.160
and I have zero leverage
and I'm desperate,

07:16.192 --> 07:17.428
I take the offer.

07:19.029 --> 07:19.863
Ugh.

07:20.830 --> 07:21.964
I didn't mean it like that.

07:21.998 --> 07:22.800
I know.

07:22.832 --> 07:23.800
I feel like it was fair.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.370
I'm not trying
to be offensive.

07:28.238 --> 07:29.305
Do you believe me?

07:29.339 --> 07:30.339
Yes.

07:30.373 --> 07:31.474
Really?

07:31.507 --> 07:32.442
Yeah.

07:32.474 --> 07:33.376
Sorry.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.945
You don't have to be sorry.

07:37.380 --> 07:42.084
Look, I think this movie
has been holding us hostage.

07:42.118 --> 07:45.288
It has and it's, you
know, time to let it go.

07:45.322 --> 07:47.257
Put it out into the world.

07:47.289 --> 07:50.359
I feel like it's a
chance to sell it.

07:50.392 --> 07:55.965
I just thought I did
everything I was supposed to do.

07:55.998 --> 07:57.200
Let me in.

07:57.233 --> 07:58.803
Let me get in here.

08:02.238 --> 08:04.274
Look, the real reason
I want you to go

08:04.307 --> 08:08.913
is because I believe in you
and I want you to be happy.

08:10.413 --> 08:14.050
I really want
people to like it.

08:14.084 --> 08:14.918
Well.

08:16.319 --> 08:18.622
There's only one
way to find out.

08:18.654 --> 08:19.455
Hey, Alex.

08:20.923 --> 08:23.960
So I've been thinking
it over a lot

08:23.993 --> 08:28.364
and doing some research and
yeah, definitely not going.

08:29.365 --> 08:31.034
You fucking bitch.

08:31.067 --> 08:31.869
I'm sorry.

08:31.901 --> 08:32.502
I'm sorry.

08:32.535 --> 08:33.337
Please continue on.

08:33.369 --> 08:34.437
Are you serious?

08:34.470 --> 08:35.671
No, look.

08:35.705 --> 08:37.373
I can't find a single reason
why we would go to this thing.

08:37.406 --> 08:38.975
And I don't think
I could stomach-

08:39.008 --> 08:40.443
- You know what
I cannot stomach?

08:40.477 --> 08:43.647
Losing insurmountable
amount of money on a movie

08:43.680 --> 08:45.382
that will never see
the light of day

08:45.415 --> 08:47.584
because you can't humble
yourself to accept a victory

08:47.617 --> 08:50.520
unless it's the perfect
fucking victory you created

08:50.552 --> 08:53.222
- in your own fucking head.
- I think we can do better.

08:53.256 --> 08:54.156
Oh, you do?

08:54.190 --> 08:55.425
Because I just got off the phone

08:55.458 --> 08:57.526
with the festival
director, Montgomery Nash,

08:57.560 --> 08:59.329
and we are nominated.

09:01.698 --> 09:03.233
We're in competition?

09:03.266 --> 09:04.368
Oh yeah, that's right.

09:04.401 --> 09:06.570
Best actor, screenplay,
cinematography,

09:06.603 --> 09:09.339
directing and best film.

09:09.372 --> 09:11.341
Come on, they want you.

09:11.373 --> 09:12.909
Man, you are the darling
of this festival.

09:12.943 --> 09:13.644
No, no, no, no.

09:13.676 --> 09:14.644
Hey, don't do that.

09:14.677 --> 09:16.512
It's gonna take this
puppy to the next level.

09:16.546 --> 09:17.680
Don't do that.

09:17.714 --> 09:18.647
This isn't a scene in the
movie where the friend tries

09:18.681 --> 09:20.651
to convince the hero
to go on an adventure.

09:20.684 --> 09:22.219
You're the hero of the story?

09:22.252 --> 09:23.053
You're not the hero.

09:23.085 --> 09:23.686
I'm the hero.

09:23.719 --> 09:25.955
No, I am the hero.

09:25.988 --> 09:27.023
I am the hero.

09:27.056 --> 09:29.158
That is so narcissistic
to call yourself a hero.

09:29.191 --> 09:32.061
I'm just a friend in the
movie that is your life.

09:32.094 --> 09:33.497
In my life, I'm the hero.

09:33.530 --> 09:35.531
You're the friend.

09:35.565 --> 09:38.468
We're all the heroes
of our own journeys.

09:38.501 --> 09:39.670
I'd be honored
to play the friend

09:39.703 --> 09:40.671
in any one of your movies.

09:40.704 --> 09:42.171
Kyle, no.

09:44.708 --> 09:46.209
Okay, here we go.

09:46.242 --> 09:48.612
The world premiere
of "Unknown Unknowns"

09:48.645 --> 09:50.414
followed by a Q&A
with writer, director,

09:50.446 --> 09:52.481
producer, editor,
and star Logan Clark,

09:52.515 --> 09:54.318
producer Alexandria Davis,

09:54.350 --> 09:57.186
and cinematographer
Tomas Jonsson.

09:58.387 --> 10:00.357
They spelled your
name all foreign.

10:00.390 --> 10:02.526
Yeah, the Swedish
spelling has umlauts.

10:02.559 --> 10:04.026
Also I'll be speaking
with a slight accent

10:04.060 --> 10:06.095
for the duration
of the festival.

10:06.128 --> 10:09.432
Like this right yeah
so just all play along.

10:09.465 --> 10:10.299
Yeah?

10:10.334 --> 10:13.002
You want us to
pretend you're Swedish?

10:13.036 --> 10:14.570
I am Swedish.

10:14.603 --> 10:16.205
Okay?

10:16.238 --> 10:18.240
I did a DNA test and
everything so it's legit.

10:18.273 --> 10:19.108
All right?

10:21.243 --> 10:22.411
What?

10:22.445 --> 10:23.446
What?

10:23.479 --> 10:24.748
Guys, listen.

10:24.781 --> 10:26.516
My main source of income
right now is renting gear.

10:26.549 --> 10:29.286
I am fucking invisible
because nobody cares

10:29.319 --> 10:33.522
about 25 years of
professional experience.

10:33.555 --> 10:37.094
Now they hear I'm Swedish,
I'm immediately qualified.

10:37.127 --> 10:41.565
So.

10:41.598 --> 10:42.399
My idols.

10:42.431 --> 10:45.502
It does look
better for the film.

10:45.535 --> 10:46.570
Any mention
of me in there?

10:46.603 --> 10:48.405
No. Nobody cares about a
production assistant.

10:48.438 --> 10:49.539
Yeah.

10:49.571 --> 10:51.207
It's Logan.

10:51.241 --> 10:52.442
It's Alex.

10:52.474 --> 10:53.276
It's me.

10:54.276 --> 10:55.445
Then it's you.

10:56.478 --> 10:58.482
You just touched
the bottom of my shoe.

10:58.515 --> 10:59.783
Yes.

10:59.815 --> 11:03.185
It's like where
the dog shit lives.

11:03.219 --> 11:04.521
Clean up the dog shit.

11:04.554 --> 11:05.589
Come on.

11:19.301 --> 11:21.337
It's pretty nice here.

11:21.371 --> 11:23.774
See, told you so.

11:23.806 --> 11:26.175
Has an old
timey kind of vibe.

11:27.576 --> 11:28.477
Look at
the way they shot

11:28.511 --> 11:30.680
my bends over the mountains.

11:30.713 --> 11:33.550
What I could shoot
here with an ND9.

11:33.583 --> 11:36.520
Well this is nice.

11:36.552 --> 11:39.422
To be on a road
that is not a road.

11:39.455 --> 11:40.289
Goddammit.

11:48.631 --> 11:49.766
So.

11:49.799 --> 11:50.600
Left?

11:50.632 --> 11:52.301
Right.

11:52.334 --> 11:54.204
Are you saying that
I'm right or to go right?

11:54.237 --> 11:55.539
I'm not sure.

11:55.571 --> 11:58.507
I think we can all
agree that someone

11:58.541 --> 12:00.643
has definitely been murdered
at one of these places.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.311
So be sure.

12:25.134 --> 12:27.136
Okay, so open concept.

12:28.371 --> 12:30.307
Ooh, also all the
beds are bunk beds.

12:30.339 --> 12:31.708
Surprise.

12:31.741 --> 12:32.843
Ha.

12:32.876 --> 12:34.310
Smart leaving that out.

12:34.344 --> 12:38.082
I call top bunk unless
any of you guys want it.

12:42.886 --> 12:44.154
If it makes
you feel any better,

12:44.186 --> 12:45.421
I won't be sleeping here.

12:46.589 --> 12:47.824
How's that?

12:47.857 --> 12:50.694
Festival groupies,
townies, hill people.

12:50.727 --> 12:52.762
Half their reason
to come is to come.

12:54.229 --> 12:56.666
Don't say that to anyone else.

12:56.699 --> 12:59.368
What, you never
heard that saying?

12:59.401 --> 13:01.403
It's actual saying.

13:01.436 --> 13:04.173
Honestly, it's kind of nice.

13:04.206 --> 13:06.709
Yeah, that's so great.

13:08.177 --> 13:09.778
Are you doing that
thing where you just agree

13:09.811 --> 13:12.414
with everything I say, but
you're actually working?

13:12.448 --> 13:14.718
Man, that is so exciting.

13:17.186 --> 13:17.786
Okay.

13:17.820 --> 13:18.622
Wait, wait, wait.

13:18.655 --> 13:19.656
I'm sorry.

13:19.689 --> 13:21.458
I'm just so swamped.

13:21.491 --> 13:22.526
You don't have to apologize.

13:22.559 --> 13:23.360
It's all right.

13:23.392 --> 13:24.194
I get it.

13:24.227 --> 13:25.428
I'm excited for you.

13:25.460 --> 13:26.495
Go get 'em.

13:26.528 --> 13:28.664
I'm excited for you.

13:28.698 --> 13:30.267
I love you.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.702
And I'm so excited to see
you on your big night.

13:32.734 --> 13:34.370
Woo hoo.

13:34.403 --> 13:35.171
I love you, too.

13:35.204 --> 13:36.573
I'll see you in
a couple of days.

13:36.605 --> 13:37.406
Bye.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.275
Bye.

13:42.711 --> 13:43.512
You know what?

13:43.546 --> 13:44.680
Use this one.

13:44.714 --> 13:46.483
Hey, you want anything
from the store?

13:46.516 --> 13:47.450
I'm okay.

13:48.350 --> 13:49.818
What the fuck is casual chic?

13:49.852 --> 13:51.655
It's like something
old, something new.

13:51.688 --> 13:52.656
Hey, listen.

13:52.689 --> 13:54.491
It doesn't matter what we wear

13:54.523 --> 13:56.659
because the film
speaks for itself.

13:56.693 --> 13:58.895
Okay, when we're here,
you're not a waiter.

13:58.927 --> 14:00.462
I'm not a personal assistant.

14:00.496 --> 14:03.433
You are the director
and I am the producer

14:03.465 --> 14:05.801
of a feature film, okay.

14:05.834 --> 14:08.704
So you need to sell
them like you sold me

14:08.738 --> 14:11.608
when you cold called my boss
and I picked up the phone.

14:11.641 --> 14:15.478
Okay, so chin up,
shoulders back and be cool.

14:15.511 --> 14:17.314
Oh captain, my captain.

14:17.347 --> 14:19.749
I would follow you to
the seventh gate of hell.

14:19.781 --> 14:23.920
Start by following me to
this casual chic gala mixer.

14:23.953 --> 14:24.887
Same thing.

14:24.921 --> 14:28.825
♪ And time mean only spells ♪

14:28.858 --> 14:30.260
I'm excited to
work on next project.

14:30.292 --> 14:32.728
Oh, the next project
is so exciting.

14:32.762 --> 14:34.631
It's probably our most
ambitious one to date.

14:34.664 --> 14:35.765
For sure, yeah.

14:35.797 --> 14:36.698
Yeah.

14:36.733 --> 14:37.800
So we had this one
idea that we would do

14:37.834 --> 14:41.271
just with one single
continuous shot of a marathon.

14:41.304 --> 14:42.539
Person running a marathon.

14:42.571 --> 14:44.273
But we won't be
using any trucks.

14:44.306 --> 14:45.774
Hi, you
here for the party?

14:45.807 --> 14:47.977
It certainly would appear so.

14:48.011 --> 14:49.779
Yeah, we have a
movie here. Yeah.

14:49.811 --> 14:51.714
"Unknown Unknowns".

14:51.748 --> 14:52.549
He's the show.

14:52.581 --> 14:53.482
I'm the business.

14:53.516 --> 14:54.317
Welcome.

14:54.349 --> 14:55.384
It's $20 a ticket.

14:55.417 --> 14:56.752
20.

14:56.786 --> 14:57.720
$20?

14:57.753 --> 14:58.754
Per ticket.

14:58.787 --> 14:59.788

14:59.821 --> 15:00.589
Oh, nice.

Shut up, Kyle.

15:05.594 --> 15:06.430

15:08.363 --> 15:08.998

15:11.800 --> 15:14.771
Okay, now these are
your entrance tickets.

15:14.804 --> 15:16.506
These are your drink tickets.

15:16.539 --> 15:17.874
And these are the
raffle tickets.

15:17.906 --> 15:20.776
Make sure you don't confuse
your entrance tickets

15:20.810 --> 15:22.612
with your raffle tickets.

15:22.645 --> 15:23.947
Can I just give
my entrance ticket

15:23.979 --> 15:26.349
right back to you
since I'm entering?

15:26.382 --> 15:29.453
No, you're gonna
give that to Gary.

15:30.786 --> 15:31.854
Hey, man.

15:31.887 --> 15:32.888
Hey, Gary.

15:34.324 --> 15:34.958

This is gonna take an hour.

16:01.017 --> 16:02.819
Yeah, that might be ambitious.

16:02.852 --> 16:03.853
Oh.

16:07.589 --> 16:09.725
Hello, hello and hello.

16:09.758 --> 16:12.728
Welcome and good
evening fellow artists.

16:12.762 --> 16:13.930
My name is Montgomery Nash.

16:13.963 --> 16:16.900
I am your humble director and
founder of the 12th annual

16:16.932 --> 16:20.402
Hollywilde International
Film Festival of Cinema.

16:20.435 --> 16:22.805
And it is my distinct
honor and pleasure

16:22.839 --> 16:24.406
to be here with
you tonight staring

16:24.440 --> 16:25.608
at all of your
beautiful, smiling,

16:25.641 --> 16:27.743
excited, and nervous faces.

16:27.776 --> 16:29.378
Don't feel self-conscious
about that.

16:29.411 --> 16:30.579
I speak from personal experience

16:30.613 --> 16:34.751
having directed seven
independent films.

16:34.783 --> 16:35.984
Thank you.

16:36.017 --> 16:37.720
Now this is my favorite
part of the festival.

16:37.753 --> 16:40.389
The Genesis, the inception,
the very beginning.

16:40.422 --> 16:42.524
It's almost like the lights
coming down in the house

16:42.557 --> 16:44.059
before we roll reel one.

16:44.093 --> 16:45.695
Anything can happen.

16:45.728 --> 16:47.397
Anything will happen.

16:47.430 --> 16:48.931
Lives will change.

16:58.775 --> 16:59.743
I'd also like to
thank all of you

16:59.776 --> 17:02.512
for your generous
voluntary ticket donation.

17:02.545 --> 17:03.780
That was voluntary?

17:03.813 --> 17:05.448
I'm gonna go get my money back.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.116
Will help to contribute
to my non-profit,

17:07.150 --> 17:09.953
Friends of Nash, a
program dedicated

17:09.986 --> 17:12.921
to shepherding neurologically
challenged filmmakers.

17:12.955 --> 17:15.825
Thanks to all of you a
differently abled filmmaker

17:15.857 --> 17:18.794
will be able to shadow an
actual feature film director

17:18.827 --> 17:20.863
on an actual feature film set.

17:20.896 --> 17:22.931
That being a set of my
next independent feature,

17:22.965 --> 17:25.901
"An Army of Juan" an
original screenplay

17:25.934 --> 17:27.870
that I recently
penned to represent

17:27.903 --> 17:30.440
the underserved Latin market.

17:30.472 --> 17:31.874
Okay, enough about my charity.

17:31.908 --> 17:33.810
Get this out of here.

17:33.843 --> 17:36.146
Tonight is about all of you.

17:36.179 --> 17:38.515
We only invite the best films.

17:38.547 --> 17:41.917
Well, my money is
halfway to Boca Raton now.

17:41.950 --> 17:43.085
And with that, I
would like to take

17:43.119 --> 17:45.522
just a moment to
share our nominees.

17:45.555 --> 17:47.990
Winners will be announced
at our awards ceremony,

17:48.024 --> 17:51.928
which will be co-hosted by
a secret celebrity guest.

17:51.960 --> 17:52.795
Okay.

17:52.828 --> 17:54.963

18:02.537 --> 18:04.007
They must be our competition.

18:04.039 --> 18:05.107

18:05.141 --> 18:06.508
Good old Hollywood.

18:06.542 --> 18:09.012
"Unknown Unknowns",

18:20.555 --> 18:22.025
Also really excited
for these guys.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.227
They literally just flew in
from our sister festival.

18:24.259 --> 18:26.595
Anyone here ever
heard of Sundance?

18:26.629 --> 18:28.598
Please try not to bombard
them with questions.

18:28.631 --> 18:32.869

this little guy

18:40.876 --> 18:42.110
all the way from Omaha, Nebraska

18:42.143 --> 18:44.046
with the world
premiere of his film

18:44.080 --> 18:46.583
shot completely
on an iPhone six.

18:49.285 --> 18:51.054

best directing.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.921
Did he say cinematography?

18:52.955 --> 18:54.090
I didn't catch it.

18:54.123 --> 18:54.923
On an iPhone.

18:54.957 --> 18:55.959
An iPhone six.

18:55.991 --> 18:56.792
You know what?

18:56.825 --> 18:58.126
Maybe it's beautiful.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.796
I can guarantee
you if it was shot

18:59.828 --> 19:01.630
on a fucking iPhone six
it's not fucking beautiful.

19:01.663 --> 19:02.598
I thought you were Swedish.

19:03.766 --> 19:05.901
Already banned in five states.

19:05.934 --> 19:09.605
"The Red in the Middle" by
Lexie Buff and Miranda Brown.

19:09.639 --> 19:12.041
Straight from
Nigeria Fela Akesi.

19:12.074 --> 19:13.642
His film has subtitles.

19:13.676 --> 19:15.979
Directed by Archibald
and Remington Haddock.

19:16.011 --> 19:18.080
Yes, they're from England
and yes, they're here.

19:18.113 --> 19:21.084
Documentarian and cancer
patient Oliver Samson.

19:21.116 --> 19:21.750
There he is right there.

19:21.785 --> 19:22.986
This one's really important.

19:23.018 --> 19:24.053
Nominated for best actor.

19:24.085 --> 19:25.587
Nominated for best actress.

19:25.621 --> 19:27.123
Nominated for best screenplay.

19:27.155 --> 19:28.892
Best cinematographer.

19:28.924 --> 19:30.225
For most acting in a film.

19:30.258 --> 19:31.627
Best outtakes reel.

19:31.661 --> 19:32.828
Nominated for.

19:33.996 --> 19:35.163
I feel like I've said
that a lot tonight.

19:35.197 --> 19:38.034
Nominated for best
directing and best film.

19:38.066 --> 19:40.703
Everyone here is nominated.

19:42.904 --> 19:46.910
Okay, so everyone's
nominated along with us.

19:46.942 --> 19:49.045
Don't forget, we're being
recognized alongside

19:49.077 --> 19:51.680
some very competent filmmakers.

19:53.882 --> 19:55.285
You know what they
didn't recognize?

19:55.317 --> 19:59.689
Was the difference between
capturing images in true 4K

19:59.721 --> 20:02.791
with master prime lenses
versus a point and shoot

20:02.825 --> 20:05.995
consumer phone camera from 2014.

20:06.027 --> 20:07.162
And I have a question.

20:07.196 --> 20:09.265
Were there any wedding
videographers in the competition?

20:09.297 --> 20:12.134
I'd very much like to
know if that was the case.

20:12.168 --> 20:16.139
Would you please tell me what
in cock's name is this about?

20:16.171 --> 20:17.007
Fuck.

20:18.841 --> 20:21.010
I just can't believe
that I won the raffle.

20:21.043 --> 20:23.979
Me, a lowly PA gets
to be a special guest

20:24.013 --> 20:26.683
on Montgomery Nash's podcast.

20:26.716 --> 20:27.551
Wow.

20:33.122 --> 20:37.627
Look, they tricked us into
giving them the premiere.

20:37.660 --> 20:40.063
Now, we gotta get
the fuck outta here.

20:40.095 --> 20:42.699
There's nothing for you in LA.

20:42.731 --> 20:46.168
No, tell me what else
you got going on, huh?

20:47.836 --> 20:48.637
You?

20:49.372 --> 20:51.173
I know you don't.

20:51.207 --> 20:52.208
Exactly.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.843
None of this changes the fact

20:53.875 --> 20:55.143
that we still have
the best movie here

20:55.177 --> 20:56.746
and we still have the premiere

20:56.778 --> 20:59.681
and there are a dozen
buyers out there

20:59.715 --> 21:04.020
just waiting to see a movie
that we are all nominated for.

21:04.053 --> 21:08.757
All that matters right now
winning an award, making a deal.

21:08.790 --> 21:10.357
We are so close to
the finish line.

21:10.359 --> 21:12.629
All we have to do is get
people to the premiere.

21:12.661 --> 21:13.296
So please.

21:14.363 --> 21:16.732
I need your help.

21:16.766 --> 21:18.034
All right.

21:18.066 --> 21:19.201
Look, we're here.

21:19.235 --> 21:20.436
Let's do it.

21:20.469 --> 21:25.141
But if we are going to compete
in this mid level festival,

21:28.076 --> 21:30.046
we better win it all.

21:31.212 --> 21:32.114
I'll pass out flyers.

21:32.148 --> 21:34.851
Do not just hand out flyers.

21:34.883 --> 21:36.151
You earn your place
at this table.

21:36.184 --> 21:39.855
You prove your
worth to this film.

21:39.889 --> 21:41.190
I understand.

21:56.104 --> 22:00.009
Does anybody wanna see
a free movie tomorrow?

22:01.242 --> 22:02.144
This guy.

22:07.882 --> 22:10.186
Do you guys wanna see
a free movie tomorrow?

22:10.219 --> 22:11.054
No, fuck off.

22:15.391 --> 22:16.392
Okay, there you go.

22:16.424 --> 22:17.259
Thank you.

22:17.293 --> 22:18.094
No problem.

22:18.126 --> 22:19.261
Have a good one.

22:19.295 --> 22:20.095
Bye.

22:36.077 --> 22:37.145
Hey, can I call you back?

22:37.179 --> 22:38.948
Just going for a
run on my treadmill.

22:38.980 --> 22:40.282
Yeah, my dad bought it for me.

22:40.315 --> 22:41.483
Work hard, play hard.

22:44.886 --> 22:46.121
Hello.

22:46.154 --> 22:48.056
Are you ready
for a killer workout?

22:48.090 --> 22:48.958
Who's this?

22:48.990 --> 22:51.994
If you stop
running, you die.

22:53.362 --> 22:54.162
I'm watching you.

22:54.196 --> 22:55.430
Help me.

22:55.463 --> 22:57.132
You think
this is a game?

22:57.165 --> 22:59.234
I don't wanna die.

23:03.205 --> 23:05.308
Dreadmill.

23:10.145 --> 23:12.214
Let's see one of
these movies here.

23:12.248 --> 23:14.316
One of these movies?

23:14.350 --> 23:17.853
At the Hollywilde International
Festival of Cinema?

23:17.886 --> 23:19.321
Our movie's one
of these movies.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.256
Yeah.

23:20.289 --> 23:21.857
Isn't the point of
being at a film festival

23:21.891 --> 23:23.426
to see a bunch of movies?

23:23.459 --> 23:26.094
Well, I'm a little
busy right now.

23:26.128 --> 23:27.864
Besides, the only
picture I'm gonna see

23:27.896 --> 23:32.367
at this shit show is "Bubbles"
by widdle Max Titty Fuck.

23:34.402 --> 23:36.338
Let's see "Black,
Brown and Beige".

23:36.372 --> 23:38.440
It starts in 20.

23:38.473 --> 23:41.076
Is that the one about the
white girl with a cool take

23:41.110 --> 23:43.546
who finds out her dad had
a bunch of secret families

23:43.578 --> 23:45.280
of all different ethnicities

23:45.314 --> 23:47.350
and she drives cross
country to meet them

23:47.382 --> 23:50.419
and finds out they're
not so different?

23:50.451 --> 23:52.756
Fuck, that is so indie.

23:53.988 --> 23:55.825
Yeah, I'll see that.

23:59.295 --> 24:02.265
You know, we all
have the same dad.

24:04.400 --> 24:08.905
When you think about it,
every human has the same dad.

24:10.271 --> 24:11.306
And mom.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.319
People would just realize

24:23.352 --> 24:27.556
that we're all brothers and
sisters, we could end racism.

24:27.590 --> 24:28.424
Racism.

24:29.557 --> 24:30.559
Shit's loco.

24:33.394 --> 24:35.530
♪ Brothers and sisters ♪

24:35.564 --> 24:38.267
♪ Misses and misters ♪

24:38.299 --> 24:43.138
♪ All different colors
and all the same ♪

24:43.171 --> 24:45.074
♪ You left our family ♪

24:45.106 --> 24:46.274
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

24:46.307 --> 24:48.411
♪ And started more families ♪

24:50.312 --> 24:52.148
Jesus Christ.

24:52.180 --> 24:53.615
That song was the last straw.

24:53.649 --> 24:55.952
I mean, how fucking
terrible is it

24:55.985 --> 24:58.054
that we have to leave early?

24:58.086 --> 25:00.256
I know, but we have to so.

25:00.288 --> 25:01.289
Oh, hey guys.

25:01.323 --> 25:02.123
Hey.

25:02.157 --> 25:02.959
Really great job.

25:02.991 --> 25:04.192
Oh, thank you.

25:04.226 --> 25:06.094
There's still like
an hour left though.

25:06.128 --> 25:07.930
Yes, but we
actually have to go.

25:07.962 --> 25:10.432
We have to go do an
interview for our movie so.

25:10.466 --> 25:12.501
Who with?

25:12.534 --> 25:14.370
- Friends of film.
- The Jewish.

25:14.402 --> 25:16.104
The Jewish friends of film.

25:16.138 --> 25:18.608
It really like bums me
out when I see artists

25:18.641 --> 25:20.476
who are like I'm just
here for my movie.

25:20.508 --> 25:21.911
You know?

25:21.943 --> 25:23.478
I don't care about
the other work.

25:23.511 --> 25:24.913
I care, man.

25:24.947 --> 25:27.083
And I support your
work, honestly.

25:27.115 --> 25:29.317
I just think maybe it
wasn't for me, you know.

25:29.351 --> 25:31.053
- Maybe he just didn't get it.
- Oh.

25:31.085 --> 25:32.488
You didn't get it.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.321
It's not for everyone.

25:33.354 --> 25:34.289
It's fine.

25:34.323 --> 25:35.557
Okay.

25:35.591 --> 25:37.293
Listen, I don't want
to lie to you guys.

25:38.324 --> 25:38.493
All right.

25:38.526 --> 25:41.529
You seem super chill, but
that was hard for me to watch.

25:41.563 --> 25:44.367
I mean the handheld was
unmotivated and all over the place.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.368
It was like the whole
movie took place

25:45.401 --> 25:46.635
during a two hour earthquake.

25:46.669 --> 25:48.304
The framing was super tight.

25:48.336 --> 25:49.337
Oh, thank you.

25:49.371 --> 25:50.272
Yeah, not like that.

25:50.305 --> 25:51.641
Sorry. Do you even
know your characters?

25:51.673 --> 25:53.075
Because to me they just seem

25:53.107 --> 25:54.209
like stereotypes
you use to pander

25:54.242 --> 25:56.411
and not even for comedy,
which is even more offensive.

25:56.444 --> 25:57.546
I will say your
Hispanic character

25:57.578 --> 25:59.981
was very obviously
an Italian man.

26:00.015 --> 26:00.917
Oh yeah, Giuseppe.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.317
I dated him for awhile.

26:02.351 --> 26:03.452
He's so talented, right?

26:03.485 --> 26:05.021
He can play every race.

26:05.054 --> 26:05.655
Oh no.

26:05.688 --> 26:06.589
Okay.

26:06.622 --> 26:08.056
I'm just saying don't make

26:08.090 --> 26:09.325
what you think
people want to see.

26:09.357 --> 26:11.326
Make what you want to say.

26:11.360 --> 26:14.997
Plus you broke the
180 like 24 times.

26:15.029 --> 26:16.431
One man's opinion, you know.

26:16.465 --> 26:17.700
Sure, but it's also-

26:17.732 --> 26:19.534
- Yeah and rules are
meant to be broken.

26:19.567 --> 26:21.336
I mean, that's the first rule.

26:21.370 --> 26:23.104
A lot of our work is
based on that principle.

26:23.138 --> 26:25.441
Yeah, but you should know
the rules that you're breaking.

26:25.473 --> 26:26.274
Yeah, no doubt.

26:26.307 --> 26:27.542
No doubt.

26:27.575 --> 26:29.511
Hey, your movie is,
what is it called?

26:29.545 --> 26:31.346
"Unknown Unknowns".

26:31.380 --> 26:32.248
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.315
Yeah.

26:33.348 --> 26:34.450
So we're reviewing all
the films at the festival

26:34.482 --> 26:36.318
for our blog Fest and Furious.

26:36.352 --> 26:37.253
You've probably heard of it.

26:37.286 --> 26:39.488
We have like 1500 subscribers.

26:41.523 --> 26:44.260
I bet your movies
like perfect.

26:44.293 --> 26:46.462
I can't wait to review it.

26:54.169 --> 26:56.738
You can't talk to your
fellow filmmakers that way.

26:56.771 --> 26:59.407
I don't think you can
call what they make film.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.575
What is this place?

27:00.609 --> 27:03.579
Jesus, there's a bird in here.

27:03.612 --> 27:04.246
Acting.

27:05.646 --> 27:08.183
It is the single hardest thing

27:08.217 --> 27:12.621
that anyone can choose
to do with their lives.

27:12.653 --> 27:15.391
This showcase is a brain
child of yours truly

27:15.423 --> 27:16.725
and it is something
that I have used

27:16.758 --> 27:20.563
to cast three of my
very own feature films.

27:21.529 --> 27:22.430
So I hope that it provides all

27:22.465 --> 27:24.400
of you artists with
the spark necessary

27:24.432 --> 27:28.069
to turn your special
project into an inferno.

27:28.103 --> 27:29.471
Oh.

27:29.505 --> 27:31.574
And there goes a little
campfire in the wind right now.

27:31.606 --> 27:32.507
Sweet fuck.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.709
Who's this fucking fuck kid?

27:34.742 --> 27:37.145
And talented actress who stars

27:37.179 --> 27:39.114
in the film "Black,
Brown and Beige",

27:39.148 --> 27:40.616
which just premiered
over at the rustic.

27:40.649 --> 27:44.286
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Marcy Bloom.

27:47.422 --> 27:48.556
I need a drink.

27:48.590 --> 27:50.192
You all are so nice.

27:50.225 --> 27:51.360
It makes me nervous.

27:51.392 --> 27:52.527
Oh blah.

27:52.561 --> 27:57.333
So I recently discovered a
movie from way back in 1994.

27:58.633 --> 28:01.336
It was a time when women
weren't yet afforded

28:01.370 --> 28:04.707
the opportunity to play
awe inspiring roles

28:04.739 --> 28:07.375
that really test the
limits of our craft.

28:07.409 --> 28:09.411
Man, she is amazing.

28:09.444 --> 28:10.712
Easy, kiddo.

28:10.746 --> 28:12.547
Don't fall in love
with an actress.

28:12.581 --> 28:13.582
I'm not.

28:13.614 --> 28:15.084
You better not.

28:15.116 --> 28:16.786
You read the Bible?

28:16.818 --> 28:18.486
Well, I got this
passage memorized.

28:18.519 --> 28:20.623
Just out of curiosity.

28:20.655 --> 28:21.623
Why not?

28:21.657 --> 28:23.559
Because you can never
truly have their love.

28:23.592 --> 28:24.593
Never.

28:24.625 --> 28:25.627
How come?

28:25.661 --> 28:27.296
They have been
taught to believe

28:27.328 --> 28:30.331
that their brand is their
self and like any corporation,

28:30.364 --> 28:32.133
there's always a bottom line.

28:32.167 --> 28:34.503
They are their own commodity.

28:34.536 --> 28:36.439
You know it's not
unlike prostitution

28:36.471 --> 28:39.141
except you know
without the sex part.

28:39.173 --> 28:40.408
Finally.

28:40.441 --> 28:41.609
Isn't that kind
of sexist though?

28:41.642 --> 28:42.777
Dude, male actors
are just as bad.

28:42.811 --> 28:44.180
Oh, if not worse.

28:44.212 --> 28:45.380
If they're working,
they're convinced

28:45.413 --> 28:47.749
that anything they do might
mean they never work again.

28:47.783 --> 28:51.654
And if they're not working,
they have no self-worth.

28:51.687 --> 28:53.856
Naturally they wanna be
leaders and providers.

28:53.889 --> 28:57.626
But in reality, they have
no control over anything.

28:57.659 --> 29:00.095
So they try to control
their relationship.

29:00.129 --> 29:01.330
It's exhausting.

29:01.363 --> 29:03.666
I get it, so just date
outside the industry.

29:03.699 --> 29:04.600
Eh.

29:04.632 --> 29:05.534
They never really understand.

29:05.566 --> 29:06.568
Well then.

29:07.768 --> 29:09.171
What am I supposed to do?

29:09.203 --> 29:11.807
When I strike my
vengeance upon you.

29:18.146 --> 29:18.746
There you go.

29:18.779 --> 29:19.581
Clap.

29:24.253 --> 29:25.488
Thanks everyone.

29:29.790 --> 29:31.626
Excuse me, I'd like.

29:35.530 --> 29:39.434
Have you ever heard the proverb
art comes not from the dues,

29:39.468 --> 29:41.469
but from the artist?

29:41.503 --> 29:46.509
I prefer this one.

29:47.543 --> 29:49.645
I don't understand.

29:49.678 --> 29:53.415
Walk softly,
carry a big stick.

29:53.448 --> 29:54.682
Yeah.

29:54.716 --> 29:56.619
So you're the guy that
shot "Unknown Unknowns"?

29:56.651 --> 29:57.719
Yes, that's correct.

29:57.753 --> 29:58.588
I am.

30:02.958 --> 30:05.561
I know you're not from Sweden.

30:05.594 --> 30:10.266
You talk crazy kid.

30:10.298 --> 30:11.901
You're a crazy talker.

30:11.933 --> 30:14.536
Your brain is
filled with crazies.

30:14.569 --> 30:15.671
Yeah.

30:15.703 --> 30:16.504
You could change your website,

30:16.537 --> 30:18.606
but you can't
change the internet.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.309
Who's the poser now?

30:21.709 --> 30:23.812
Who's the poser, he says?

30:23.844 --> 30:25.581
He's a crazy person.

30:25.613 --> 30:27.882
Someone's led a
crazy person out.

30:27.915 --> 30:29.417
Tiny crazy.

30:29.450 --> 30:30.286
Goddammit.

30:31.953 --> 30:34.890
Can I get a fucking
whiskey please?

30:35.824 --> 30:36.725
I'ma grab a beer.

30:36.757 --> 30:37.759
You want one?

30:37.793 --> 30:38.594
Sure.

30:38.626 --> 30:39.427
Okay.

30:39.460 --> 30:40.295
Ooh.

30:40.328 --> 30:41.663
Hey, can I borrow
your credit card?

30:41.697 --> 30:42.631
Yeah.

30:42.663 --> 30:44.866
My identity's been stolen.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.669
That's the reason.

30:46.701 --> 30:47.737
That sucks.

30:48.737 --> 30:49.772
You okay?

30:49.805 --> 30:50.639
Ugh, I'm stressed.

30:50.672 --> 30:51.640
You know, I'm stressed
about tomorrow.

30:51.673 --> 30:53.908
Stressed about getting
people to the premiere.

30:53.941 --> 30:56.679
Stressed about
selling this thing.

30:56.711 --> 30:57.779
Just kind of.

30:58.980 --> 31:00.382
I know.

31:00.414 --> 31:02.383
We'll pound the
pavement tomorrow.

31:02.417 --> 31:03.252
Okay.

31:05.554 --> 31:07.389
I'ma go get those drinks.

31:07.421 --> 31:08.257
Okay.

31:09.790 --> 31:10.892
Thank you.

31:15.998 --> 31:17.600
You wanna
see a movie tomorrow?

31:17.632 --> 31:18.567
Nah, I'm good.

31:18.601 --> 31:19.569
Do the nominators even
know the differences

31:19.602 --> 31:22.403
between the color sensor
and auto focus smart?

31:22.437 --> 31:23.339
Designed to fit your pocket.

31:23.372 --> 31:24.806
And the craft and the care

31:24.840 --> 31:28.611
that goes into creating
15 stops of dynamic range.

31:28.643 --> 31:30.679
I went to film school and
I don't even understand it.

31:30.711 --> 31:31.646
Fuck everybody.

31:31.680 --> 31:32.480
Excuse me.

31:32.514 --> 31:33.382
Hey.

31:33.414 --> 31:34.782
Hi. Yeah, I don't
want to be a dick,

31:34.815 --> 31:36.418
but you guys were
kind of dicks first

31:36.450 --> 31:38.420
by covering all our
posters with your posters.

31:38.452 --> 31:40.021
Yeah, what the fuck?

31:40.055 --> 31:40.855
Fucking.

31:40.889 --> 31:42.291
Kyle.

31:42.324 --> 31:43.491
Yeah, but you told
me specifically-

31:43.525 --> 31:46.594
- Not to cover anyone
else's posters.

31:46.628 --> 31:47.830
Sorry, guys.

31:47.863 --> 31:49.030
PA. I'm sure he didn't
mean any offense.

31:49.064 --> 31:50.332
Yeah, we get it.

31:50.364 --> 31:51.767
It's the hustle, right?

31:51.799 --> 31:52.801
Yeah.

31:54.036 --> 31:54.836
I'm Logan.

31:54.870 --> 31:55.671
Yeah, I remember.

31:55.703 --> 31:56.704
I'm Sarah.

31:56.738 --> 31:57.572
Max.

31:57.605 --> 32:00.475
Tomas Jonsson,
director of photography.

32:00.508 --> 32:01.776
It's our DP Tom.

32:01.809 --> 32:03.411
Tomas.

32:03.444 --> 32:04.445
Tomas.

32:04.478 --> 32:05.680
Nominated.

32:05.713 --> 32:06.815
Also from Sweden.

32:06.847 --> 32:07.649
Wow.

32:07.682 --> 32:08.850
Bergman.

32:08.883 --> 32:10.352
It's cool you're
out here hitting the streets.

32:10.384 --> 32:12.820
I mean, considering Sundance.

32:12.853 --> 32:14.957
Sundance doesn't mean shit.

32:14.989 --> 32:16.025
Really?

32:16.057 --> 32:18.559
Not unless you have Ryan
Gosling in your movie.

32:18.593 --> 32:19.862
I mean, yeah, we have agents now

32:19.894 --> 32:23.632
and solid TBTs on
Insta for like a year,

32:23.664 --> 32:27.802
but no distribution, no
financing for our next film.

32:27.835 --> 32:29.771
You got to hunt
for your own food.

32:29.805 --> 32:31.073
We're headed to
this masterclass.

32:31.105 --> 32:32.775
Y'all wanna join?

32:32.807 --> 32:35.743
Montgomery Nash's guide
to the cinematic landscape.

32:35.776 --> 32:37.645
Sounds cringe.

32:37.679 --> 32:40.315
Isn't that kind of the
point of film festivals?

32:40.348 --> 32:44.652
A place for filmmakers to
exchange and enhance ideas.

32:44.686 --> 32:48.390
Otherwise we could
just send links.

32:48.422 --> 32:51.294
I mean, plus we could
actually learn something.

32:52.893 --> 32:53.695
Cinema.

32:55.130 --> 32:57.333
Cinema!

32:58.933 --> 33:01.703
The landscape is
changing before our eyes

33:01.737 --> 33:03.971
as fast as Peter
O'Toole blew out a match

33:04.005 --> 33:07.810
and made an entire desert
appear before our eyes.

33:07.843 --> 33:09.844
As fast as a single cut.

33:11.580 --> 33:13.049
The blink of an eye.

33:16.384 --> 33:21.022
That was "Lawrence of Arabia"
is the film I was referring to

33:21.055 --> 33:24.793
with the match thingy there.

33:24.825 --> 33:26.527
I know there's some
younger artists

33:26.561 --> 33:28.397
that's part of our
masterclass today,

33:28.430 --> 33:30.999
not that that excuses you
from knowing your history.

33:32.633 --> 33:34.435
The future is now.

33:34.469 --> 33:39.475
And that future is the
self-contained horror slash thriller.

33:40.674 --> 33:42.143
It can be either really so long

33:42.177 --> 33:45.715
as it is limited to
one little location.

33:46.648 --> 33:47.483
A jukebox.

33:49.785 --> 33:50.853
A tractor tire.

33:52.487 --> 33:53.389
Tiny.

33:53.421 --> 33:54.789
I can't actually do this.

33:54.823 --> 33:56.758
I'm freaking out.

33:56.792 --> 33:58.694
I'm gonna stay.

33:58.727 --> 33:59.527
Really?

33:59.561 --> 34:00.728
Yeah.

34:00.761 --> 34:03.698
I'm interested to see how far
he can actually take this.

34:03.731 --> 34:04.899
Quick exercise.

34:05.734 --> 34:07.936
Please share with me
some little places

34:07.969 --> 34:09.971
you could trap two women in.

34:10.004 --> 34:10.805
Anyone.

34:10.839 --> 34:11.940
Yes.

34:13.140 --> 34:16.177
Okay, I don't know what that
is, but it sounds foreign,

34:16.210 --> 34:19.013
which is important for
the foreign film markets.

34:19.047 --> 34:20.783
Anything else?

34:20.815 --> 34:23.185
An automatic pool cover.

34:23.218 --> 34:24.420
I'm sorry, no, you can't.

34:24.453 --> 34:25.053
You can't do that.

34:25.085 --> 34:25.953
It's already a movie.

34:25.986 --> 34:27.522
I actually reviewed
it for my website.

34:27.556 --> 34:28.757
Oh.

34:28.790 --> 34:30.025
A website.

34:30.058 --> 34:31.727
Now that.

34:31.759 --> 34:33.194
That is forward thinking.

34:33.227 --> 34:34.962
Never been done before.

34:34.995 --> 34:37.465
So as you can see, it could
be just about anywhere.

34:37.498 --> 34:38.466
Ooh, I don't know.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.436
How about a wooden box?

34:41.502 --> 34:43.506
Sheila, Jen, come on up.

34:53.181 --> 34:54.817
Escaping.

34:57.218 --> 34:58.019
Busted.

34:58.053 --> 34:59.455
Yeah.

34:59.488 --> 35:01.190
I guess self-contained horror

35:01.223 --> 35:03.826
slash thriller films
aren't really my thing.

35:03.859 --> 35:04.893
Yeah.

35:04.926 --> 35:06.128
Me neither.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.962
It's like, I'm glad you
guys stretched a buck,

35:07.995 --> 35:08.997
but I'm still paying full price.

35:09.029 --> 35:10.598
So take me somewhere.

35:10.631 --> 35:11.966
Just be a play.

35:12.000 --> 35:12.634
You know?

35:13.768 --> 35:14.970
Hey, can I bum one of those?

35:15.002 --> 35:15.937
Yeah.

35:15.971 --> 35:17.573
Thanks.

35:22.676 --> 35:24.745
There you go.

35:28.082 --> 35:28.883
You good?

35:28.917 --> 35:29.551
Yeah.

35:32.087 --> 35:34.957
Altitude has got me, I think.

35:34.989 --> 35:35.825
Yeah.

35:36.924 --> 35:37.926
Sorry.

35:37.959 --> 35:39.261
I'm Logan, by the way.

35:39.294 --> 35:40.496
I know who you are.

35:40.529 --> 35:41.129
I'm Kim Lincoln.

35:41.161 --> 35:42.797
Yeah, I forgot.

35:42.830 --> 35:46.234
We were all introduced when
everyone was nominated.

35:47.234 --> 35:50.271
Yeah.

35:50.305 --> 35:52.140
God, it's
bullshit, isn't it?

35:52.172 --> 35:53.207
What is?

35:53.241 --> 35:54.910
This whole festival.

35:54.942 --> 35:57.912
It's just a bunch of
self-proclaimed artists

35:57.946 --> 35:59.148
in a circle jerk.

36:00.314 --> 36:02.950
Man, this is about
to get real weird.

36:02.984 --> 36:03.919
What is?

36:03.951 --> 36:05.187
This relationship.

36:05.219 --> 36:06.821
How so?

36:06.855 --> 36:10.860
I'm the senior programmer
of the circle jerk so.

36:13.594 --> 36:14.196
Fuck.

36:14.228 --> 36:15.062
Mm hm, yeah.

36:15.096 --> 36:16.064
I am so sorry.

36:16.096 --> 36:18.232
It's okay.

36:18.265 --> 36:19.066
That sucks.

36:19.100 --> 36:20.268
You're fine.

36:22.102 --> 36:25.306
I think the festival experience
is all about perspective.

36:25.339 --> 36:29.178
You know, I really liked
your film by the way.

36:31.279 --> 36:32.047
Yeah?

36:32.080 --> 36:33.114
Yeah.

36:34.082 --> 36:36.051
I bet you say that
to all the filmmakers.

36:36.084 --> 36:38.020
Yeah, I do.

36:38.053 --> 36:39.121
No.

36:39.154 --> 36:40.089
I loved it.

36:41.723 --> 36:44.593
Your balance between humor
and drama was quite elegant.

36:44.625 --> 36:47.062
It's like you managed to
capture this raw humanity

36:47.094 --> 36:49.797
while still allowing us to
crack up at the brevity of life.

36:49.830 --> 36:53.134
Very John Cassavetes
meets Sophia Coppola.

36:56.270 --> 36:58.973
That's like exactly
what I was going for.

36:59.006 --> 37:01.642
Senior fucking
programmer, dude.

37:03.611 --> 37:05.079
Are you okay?

37:05.113 --> 37:05.846
I don't smoke.

37:05.879 --> 37:07.047
I don't smoke.

37:07.080 --> 37:08.316
I don't know why I thought
that'd be good, but it was not.

37:08.350 --> 37:09.884
It did not good.

37:11.953 --> 37:13.055
You good?

37:13.087 --> 37:14.288
Yeah, I'm good.

37:14.321 --> 37:16.223
You know, can I
make an observation?

37:16.256 --> 37:18.659
You seemed jaded.

37:18.692 --> 37:19.761
Please, don't hold back.

37:19.794 --> 37:20.629
I can take it.

37:20.661 --> 37:21.863
Be honest with me.

37:21.895 --> 37:24.065
No, it's just like
you made one feature.

37:24.098 --> 37:26.167
You already seem exhausted.

37:26.201 --> 37:29.103
One feature and 27 shorts.

37:29.136 --> 37:30.339
Great.

37:30.372 --> 37:33.975
I mean, why'd you
become a filmmaker?

37:34.009 --> 37:34.910
I don't know.

37:34.942 --> 37:37.645
I can't tie it to one thing.

37:37.678 --> 37:41.015
I guess, because I grew up in
the golden age of indie films.

37:41.049 --> 37:42.718
Well so did everyone
else that you grew up with.

37:42.750 --> 37:45.019
Yeah, but for my friends,

37:45.053 --> 37:47.154
making movies was
just something fun

37:47.187 --> 37:50.892
to do on the weekends,
but I was obsessed.

37:54.129 --> 37:58.701
God, I hate fucking talking
like this but making movies

38:00.167 --> 38:03.070
helped me understand the world

38:03.103 --> 38:08.109
and I hoped would help the world
understand me a little bit.

38:10.779 --> 38:12.081
So, I went all in.

38:15.082 --> 38:18.853
And I did it just in
time for no one to care.

38:19.988 --> 38:21.723
God, boo hoo.

38:21.756 --> 38:23.024
Do you like your movie?

38:23.058 --> 38:24.193
Yeah.

38:24.225 --> 38:27.028
Then what the fuck does
it matter what anyone cares?

38:27.062 --> 38:28.029
I mean, you made one, Logan.

38:28.062 --> 38:29.730
You added to the culture.

38:29.763 --> 38:31.932
Well, 'cause it's my career.

38:31.966 --> 38:34.736
And the movie's tied
entirely to my identity.

38:34.768 --> 38:35.404
And.

38:37.038 --> 38:39.007
And if I don't make it,
what else is there for me?

38:39.040 --> 38:40.709
You wanna know a secret?

38:40.741 --> 38:42.910
There's no such
thing as making it.

38:42.944 --> 38:45.313
Even when you're there,
you're never there.

38:45.346 --> 38:47.114
It's always gonna be
one step out of reach

38:47.147 --> 38:48.883
and that's the way it should be.

38:48.917 --> 38:50.819
Besides, by the time you have
a ton of money in the bank,

38:50.852 --> 38:53.788
you're gonna feel like
a hack, so fuck it.

38:55.823 --> 38:57.091
I was an executive at a studio

38:57.125 --> 38:59.460
that killed everything
I loved about movies.

38:59.493 --> 39:01.129
I actually just came out here

39:01.161 --> 39:03.397
to do mushrooms with my
friends, which was magical,

39:03.431 --> 39:05.801
but then a week
turned into a month

39:05.834 --> 39:07.402
and cut to seven years later.

39:07.435 --> 39:09.705
Instead of cut to,
can we dissolve to?

39:09.738 --> 39:11.272
You're so dumb.

39:11.306 --> 39:13.241
Anyway, I love it here.

39:13.274 --> 39:16.844
I mean, plus the fest allows
me to keep movies in my orbit.

39:16.877 --> 39:20.147
Nash and I are expanding
into more production, too.

39:20.181 --> 39:22.284
Sounds like you got
everything you want.

39:22.317 --> 39:25.921
The dating scene
could use a little help.

39:27.254 --> 39:28.957
Anyway, this is my place.

39:28.989 --> 39:30.158
Oh wow.

39:30.190 --> 39:31.093
It's a nice place.

39:31.125 --> 39:33.461
Yeah, gets the job done.

39:33.495 --> 39:35.263
I've got a hot tub.

39:38.466 --> 39:40.736
So, big premiere tonight.

39:40.768 --> 39:41.368
Yeah?

39:41.402 --> 39:42.204
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:42.236 --> 39:43.238
Yeah.

39:43.270 --> 39:44.272
I'm excited.

39:44.305 --> 39:45.306
You should be.

39:45.339 --> 39:46.307
I am, yeah.

39:46.341 --> 39:48.176
Should actually probably
go get ready for that.

39:48.209 --> 39:49.009
Oh, okay.

39:49.042 --> 39:49.977
Yeah, cool.

39:50.944 --> 39:52.279
Well, thanks for walking me.

39:52.312 --> 39:53.814
Yep.

39:53.848 --> 39:56.151
But don't smoke
any more cigarettes.

39:56.183 --> 39:56.984
I won't.

39:57.018 --> 39:58.153
Okay.

39:58.185 --> 39:59.388
All right, Logan.

40:03.024 --> 40:04.159
I'll see you tonight.

40:04.192 --> 40:06.361
See you tonight.

40:08.029 --> 40:09.064
Should probably get moving

40:09.096 --> 40:10.899
- if you wanna get there.
- Yup, yup.

40:10.931 --> 40:13.033
Dude, suck her dick.

40:13.067 --> 40:14.936
Okay, well we had a nice chat.

40:14.968 --> 40:17.404
Okay, but literally
suck her dick.

40:17.437 --> 40:19.440
She can get us a trophy.

40:20.841 --> 40:21.910
Hey, where you been?

40:21.942 --> 40:23.377
We gotta go soon.

40:26.948 --> 40:28.783
I watched "Bubbles".

40:30.051 --> 40:31.319
The whole thing.

40:31.352 --> 40:32.554
The little kid movie?

40:32.587 --> 40:34.823
Jesus, it was that bad?

40:34.855 --> 40:35.491
No.

40:37.192 --> 40:38.160
It was good.

40:39.127 --> 40:40.027
Absolutely.

40:51.406 --> 40:52.207
Hello?

40:53.241 --> 40:56.078
You can't hate me, okay?

40:57.312 --> 41:00.214
You don't sound
like you're in a car.

41:00.247 --> 41:03.217
Because I'm still
at the office.

41:03.250 --> 41:04.319
Really?

41:04.352 --> 41:08.924
I'm so sorry, but they're
making me first chair.

41:08.957 --> 41:12.861
I have to be here to
present in the morning.

41:12.893 --> 41:13.529
Okay.

41:14.629 --> 41:16.230
I know it sucks.

41:16.263 --> 41:17.865
It's all right.

41:22.937 --> 41:24.205
I love you.

41:24.239 --> 41:26.241
Yeah, I love you, too.

41:29.410 --> 41:31.312
Hey, what's up?

41:31.346 --> 41:32.414
Amy can't come.

41:32.446 --> 41:33.347
Oh, damn.

41:34.248 --> 41:35.082
You okay?

41:36.551 --> 41:37.386
Yeah.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.288
Let's do this.

41:47.562 --> 41:48.363
Okay.

41:49.564 --> 41:51.199
Hey, you guys ready?

41:51.232 --> 41:52.334
I'm so pumped.

41:52.366 --> 41:53.535
Kyle, no.

41:53.567 --> 41:54.368
Chill, man.

41:54.402 --> 41:55.270
Do not embarrass us.

41:55.303 --> 41:56.305
Okay.

42:05.046 --> 42:06.381
What the fuck?

42:07.381 --> 42:08.382
What?

42:08.415 --> 42:09.417
I created a job.

42:09.450 --> 42:10.919
It's a win-win.

42:10.951 --> 42:12.419
Hey.

42:12.453 --> 42:14.389
You excited?

42:14.422 --> 42:15.557
Are you excited?

42:17.292 --> 42:18.560
I mean.

42:18.593 --> 42:20.194
This is the premiere.

42:20.227 --> 42:22.329
It's the first time people
are gonna see it so.

42:22.363 --> 42:23.330
Yeah.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.235
Okay, everybody.

42:27.268 --> 42:30.472
I am told there will be
press at the red carpet.

42:30.504 --> 42:31.906
Play it cool.

42:38.478 --> 42:40.348
It's more like
a red welcome mat.

42:40.381 --> 42:41.583
Filmmaker badges.

42:41.616 --> 42:43.018
Hey, let's grab
some pics and video.

42:43.051 --> 42:45.020
I gotta check with
the projectionist.

42:45.053 --> 42:46.453
Should I also do an interview

42:46.486 --> 42:47.687
since I have a speaking role?

42:47.721 --> 42:50.091
Kyle, if you say one word,
I will throw you into traffic.

42:50.123 --> 42:51.259
Okay.

42:51.292 --> 42:52.227
I'm Allison.

42:52.259 --> 42:52.993
I'll be interviewing you.

42:53.027 --> 42:53.628
Hey.

42:53.660 --> 42:55.029
Hi.

42:55.062 --> 42:56.964
Logan Clark, writer,
director, actor.

42:56.997 --> 42:57.598
Oh.

42:57.631 --> 42:58.432
Cool.

42:58.466 --> 43:00.301
I'm also an actress.

43:00.335 --> 43:02.404
So if you ever
wanna collaborate.

43:02.437 --> 43:03.438
Thanks.

43:03.471 --> 43:04.372
Sure.

43:04.404 --> 43:05.372
I'll give this to my producer.

43:05.406 --> 43:06.641
Oh, you know what?

43:06.674 --> 43:09.210
One for each and an extra.

43:09.243 --> 43:10.679
- Oh.
- Have a ball with them.

43:10.712 --> 43:12.380
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

43:12.413 --> 43:15.183
Allison Sharp here with
writer, director, actor,

43:15.216 --> 43:17.551
producer, editor, Logan Clark.

43:17.585 --> 43:19.454
What else do you do?

43:19.486 --> 43:20.321
I bake.

43:22.991 --> 43:23.591
Not really.

43:23.623 --> 43:24.426
That was, sorry.

43:24.459 --> 43:25.527
I was joking.

43:26.694 --> 43:27.962
Okay.

43:27.995 --> 43:28.629
Sorry.

43:30.464 --> 43:34.169
Now I hear you really let
it all hang out in this film.

43:34.201 --> 43:36.404
Full frontal nudity.

43:36.437 --> 43:37.372
Whoa.

43:37.404 --> 43:40.975
Yeah, but it's not
intended as shock humor

43:41.009 --> 43:42.444
so much as our heroes-

43:42.477 --> 43:43.712
- You.

43:43.745 --> 43:46.647
Maybe I should be
interviewing you.

43:46.681 --> 43:48.350
You.

43:48.382 --> 43:52.520
My character's expression of
his freedom and fearlessness

43:53.721 --> 43:55.357
and his rejection
of societal norms.

43:55.390 --> 43:56.223
Yes.

43:56.256 --> 43:58.058
But also it's funny.

43:58.091 --> 44:00.361
Well, it is a penis.

44:00.395 --> 44:01.296
That's true.

44:01.328 --> 44:03.731
So what's your movie about?

44:03.765 --> 44:06.433
And why do you think
people want to see it?

44:06.466 --> 44:07.267
Wow.

44:07.301 --> 44:08.103
Yeah.

44:08.136 --> 44:09.337
Yeah.

44:09.370 --> 44:11.506
Well, I guess the movie
is about what happens

44:11.538 --> 44:13.274
when your dreams meet reality.

44:13.306 --> 44:18.680
Oh, kind of like those memes,
expectation versus reality.

44:18.712 --> 44:19.513
I don't know.

44:19.547 --> 44:21.216
Oh, okay.

44:21.248 --> 44:24.419
Well, so like I did this insta
post about "Dirty Dancing".

44:24.451 --> 44:27.756
So what I did is I pulled
from JLo's booty shake video

44:27.788 --> 44:31.692
to show what I think I look
like and then get this.

44:31.725 --> 44:36.530
A dog humping a pillow for
what I really look like.

44:36.564 --> 44:37.531
Ugh, ugh, ugh.

44:39.267 --> 44:40.067
Yeah.

44:40.100 --> 44:40.701
Yeah.

44:40.734 --> 44:42.136
Yeah, like that.

44:42.169 --> 44:44.372
Like that or like
expecting to be able

44:44.404 --> 44:46.373
to talk about your
movie but in reality,

44:46.406 --> 44:49.477
being told about
someone else's memes.

44:49.509 --> 44:50.745
What the hell was that?

44:50.777 --> 44:51.678
I don't know.

44:51.712 --> 44:53.047
It was like an episode
of "Black Mirror".

44:53.080 --> 44:54.048
Is my face bleeding?

44:54.082 --> 44:54.681
No, no, no.

44:54.714 --> 44:55.517
No, you're fine.

44:55.549 --> 44:56.718
You are fine.

44:56.750 --> 44:58.386
Okay listen, your movie
is about to premiere

44:58.419 --> 45:00.154
in front of an audience
that loves movies.

45:00.187 --> 45:03.424
And I mean, it's
just dying to laugh.

45:03.457 --> 45:04.291
Stop giving me tickets.

45:04.326 --> 45:05.660
There's no reason
for these tickets.

45:05.692 --> 45:08.196
These tickets don't
mean anything.

45:13.533 --> 45:15.402
God, she's so nice.

45:15.435 --> 45:16.703
I really want to date her.

45:16.736 --> 45:18.138
Are you sure I'm not allowed?

45:18.172 --> 45:19.274
I cannot give
advice right now.

45:19.306 --> 45:20.341
There's too much on the line.

45:20.373 --> 45:21.576
Okay.

45:21.609 --> 45:24.478
There are a lot
of people here.

45:24.511 --> 45:26.280
The projectionist has
his head up his ass.

45:26.314 --> 45:27.714
I didn't have time to QC.

45:27.747 --> 45:29.716
So we have no idea how
it's gonna look and sound?

45:29.750 --> 45:31.518
It's the middle
of the festival.

45:31.551 --> 45:33.120
I'm sure it's fine.

45:34.888 --> 45:35.723
Logan, sh.

45:39.826 --> 45:41.129
The format's off.

45:41.161 --> 45:41.763
What?

45:41.796 --> 45:43.464
It's cropped a little.

45:43.497 --> 45:44.531
Fuck.

45:44.564 --> 45:46.467
It's scaled to about 110%.

45:46.500 --> 45:47.768
I can't even tell.

45:47.801 --> 45:49.570
No, he's right.

45:49.603 --> 45:50.672
We need to stop it.

45:50.705 --> 45:52.607
Or we're gonna have a
lot of unintended haircuts.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.642
No one can tell
but the two of you.

45:54.674 --> 45:55.676
It is going great.

45:55.710 --> 45:57.846
You're gonna kill it.

45:57.879 --> 45:59.614
I'm gonna set the
building on fire.

45:59.647 --> 46:00.649
No.

46:03.651 --> 46:05.419
They're into it.

46:09.623 --> 46:10.625
My hands are so sweaty.

46:10.658 --> 46:11.459
It's okay, it's okay.

46:11.491 --> 46:12.326
I'm sorry.

46:12.359 --> 46:13.160
Sh.

46:16.897 --> 46:20.835
They don't sell those in
singles.

46:26.406 --> 46:28.308
That is your penis.

46:28.341 --> 46:30.210
Yes, it is.

47:14.388 --> 47:16.223
I don't know
what a Frenchie is.

47:16.256 --> 47:17.424
How about a rum and Coke?

47:17.457 --> 47:18.258
Thanks for coming.

47:18.292 --> 47:19.060
Thanks for being here.

47:19.093 --> 47:19.861
- Great film.
- Thank you.

47:19.893 --> 47:20.761
Hey.

47:20.794 --> 47:21.595
Hi.

47:21.629 --> 47:22.430
Congratulations.

47:22.462 --> 47:23.363
Thank you.

47:23.397 --> 47:24.498
Was even better
on the big screen.

47:24.531 --> 47:25.332
Right?

47:25.366 --> 47:26.201
It's like night and day.

47:26.234 --> 47:27.435
I know.

47:27.468 --> 47:29.837
Hey, do you have plans
for lunch tomorrow?

47:29.870 --> 47:30.703
No.

47:30.738 --> 47:32.473
Great, because I
got you a sit down

47:32.506 --> 47:34.241
with a hot shot
producer over at Disney.

47:34.274 --> 47:34.942
She's a friend of mine.

47:34.975 --> 47:36.611
She saw the film.

47:36.643 --> 47:38.712
She said she might have
some work to throw your way.

47:38.745 --> 47:39.713
You're the best.

47:39.747 --> 47:40.448
Yeah.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.984
- That's amazing.
- I know.

47:43.017 --> 47:46.520
And the flower growing out
of the crack in the pavement.

47:46.553 --> 47:47.754
Come on.

47:47.788 --> 47:48.990
That's like my new
"Garden State".

47:49.022 --> 47:50.691
Oh, wow.

47:50.725 --> 47:53.428
Yeah, that's also a movie.

47:53.460 --> 47:55.430
Can you please get us
an interview with Logan?

47:55.462 --> 47:56.296
Oh, of course.

47:56.330 --> 47:58.333
- Oh.
- Ah, thank you.

47:58.366 --> 47:59.734
Seriously, great job.

47:59.767 --> 48:00.734
Skol.

48:01.634 --> 48:04.705
What lens
package did you use?

48:06.774 --> 48:07.741
Haag and Dorf.

48:07.774 --> 48:10.444
It's the guys I stole
the glass patent from.

48:10.477 --> 48:13.413
Yeah, I don't know
who those guys are,

48:13.446 --> 48:14.982
but they sound pretty dope.

48:15.015 --> 48:17.651
BT dubs, your shit
looked bad ass.

48:17.685 --> 48:19.320
Well, thanks, man.

48:19.352 --> 48:21.822
I wanted to tell you that
I saw your movie, too,

48:21.855 --> 48:23.790
and I think you
have an amazing eye.

48:23.823 --> 48:26.393
That's nice of you to say.

48:26.426 --> 48:30.731
If you set it with a real
accent, I might believe you.

48:32.433 --> 48:33.635
I mean it.

48:33.667 --> 48:35.769
What you did with
available light,

48:35.803 --> 48:39.806
felt like watching "Barry
Lyndon" or "The Long Goodbye".

48:39.839 --> 48:43.611
And you did it just with
a consumer CCD and iMovie.

48:43.643 --> 48:47.714
I mean, you were like tin
cup with a seven iron.

48:47.747 --> 48:50.517
Your references
are old as fuck, bro.

48:50.551 --> 48:53.755
Hey, brilliant work was
done way before you were born.

48:53.788 --> 48:55.990
Somebody should
do their homework.

48:56.022 --> 48:59.626
I'm talking the criterion
collection, little man.

48:59.660 --> 49:03.897
And old fucks like myself, you
can still learn a lot from us

49:03.931 --> 49:07.702
and old folks could probably
learn a lot from you, too.

49:07.734 --> 49:09.937
Like for real though,
you need to focus

49:09.969 --> 49:12.873
on more than just movies.

49:12.906 --> 49:13.841
What's that?

49:13.875 --> 49:17.312
I made like eight
features on my phone.

49:17.344 --> 49:18.546
How much longer is this format

49:18.578 --> 49:20.647
of storytelling
gonna be a thing?

49:20.681 --> 49:23.484
I'm worried about
the next generation.

49:23.517 --> 49:24.319
What's the next?

49:24.352 --> 49:25.520
Like four year olds?

49:25.553 --> 49:27.622
Fuck yeah, four year olds.

49:27.654 --> 49:31.493
I mean, they're growing
up on VR and AR, CYOA.

49:33.093 --> 49:36.997
- Choose your own adventure.
- Your own adventure.

49:37.964 --> 49:39.733
Hey, there he is.

49:39.767 --> 49:40.868
Mr. Director.

49:40.901 --> 49:42.803
Hey, this guy.

49:42.837 --> 49:44.505
Listen, I just
wanted to let you know,

49:44.538 --> 49:46.708
this is my favorite
film of the festival.

49:46.741 --> 49:47.675
Really?

49:47.707 --> 49:48.875
Absolutely.

49:48.908 --> 49:50.444
Truly it is. I mean,
this is the kind of film

49:50.477 --> 49:52.546
that I started
this festival for.

49:52.580 --> 49:53.881
That means so much, man.

49:53.913 --> 49:55.415
Let me guess.

49:55.448 --> 49:57.684
You got rejected by
all the other fests.

49:57.718 --> 49:58.786
Yeah, pretty much.

49:58.819 --> 50:01.556
You know why that is, right?

50:01.589 --> 50:03.091
It's 'cause you scare them.

50:03.123 --> 50:04.725
I'm okay with that.

50:04.759 --> 50:07.862
I mean, since when did it
become so scary to scare people?

50:07.895 --> 50:10.531
I mean, they're just
intimidated by your talent.

50:10.564 --> 50:12.567
Trust me, I know
what that's like.

50:12.600 --> 50:13.801
Yeah, man.

50:13.834 --> 50:16.136
I knew we nominated
you for a reason.

50:16.169 --> 50:17.571
God, you're gonna make me cry.

50:17.605 --> 50:18.406
Ah, come on.

50:18.439 --> 50:19.640
You deserve it.

50:19.672 --> 50:21.642
And listen, don't tell
anybody I told you this,

50:21.674 --> 50:23.810
but I'm fairly certain
you'll be heading home

50:23.843 --> 50:27.514
with some hardware in
your luggage this week.

50:27.547 --> 50:28.815
Thank you, Mr. Nash.

50:28.848 --> 50:30.151
Stop that.

50:30.183 --> 50:32.486
My friends call me Monty.

51:06.486 --> 51:07.921
Logan.

51:07.955 --> 51:08.790
Amy.

51:09.957 --> 51:12.859
You got
drunk, didn't you?

51:12.893 --> 51:14.862
I got very drunk.

51:14.895 --> 51:15.830
Yes, I did.

51:17.631 --> 51:20.968
You wanna go to bed and
just call me in the morning?

51:21.000 --> 51:21.803
No, no, wait.

51:21.835 --> 51:22.636
Hold on.

51:22.669 --> 51:24.505
I called for a reason.

51:25.739 --> 51:26.574
Oh.

51:31.011 --> 51:31.913
Hey.

51:31.946 --> 51:33.047
No, I just.

51:35.582 --> 51:40.020
I wanted to say I'm really
bummed you didn't make it.

51:41.622 --> 51:43.491
You really let me down.

51:43.524 --> 51:44.125
What?

51:44.158 --> 51:44.959
No, no, no.

51:44.991 --> 51:45.993
No, it's whatever.

51:46.026 --> 51:46.993
It's whatever.

51:47.027 --> 51:49.030
I just try and communicate.

51:50.897 --> 51:52.866
They really liked it.

51:52.899 --> 51:54.035
They liked me.

51:56.102 --> 51:59.172
And I wish you could
have been there.

51:59.205 --> 52:01.508
I'm really sorry.

52:01.542 --> 52:04.011
I really wanted to be there,

52:04.044 --> 52:05.913
but I couldn't get
away from work.

52:05.946 --> 52:07.515
I called you.

52:07.547 --> 52:09.716
And it was a big deal for.

52:11.785 --> 52:12.587
Logan.

52:30.803 --> 52:32.072
Pancakes are ready.

52:37.810 --> 52:38.613
Everything's fine.

52:38.645 --> 52:39.814
It's all good.

52:43.049 --> 52:43.884
Ah.

52:53.259 --> 52:54.861
Yeah.

52:54.895 --> 52:56.130
I'm gonna need that
fuel for my meeting

52:56.163 --> 52:57.832
with that producer at Disney.

52:57.864 --> 52:58.799
Oh hell yes.

52:58.832 --> 52:59.634
I heard.

53:01.234 --> 53:04.604
Man, we are putting the
wild and Hollywilde.

53:04.638 --> 53:05.273
Hey.

53:07.341 --> 53:08.910
I don't have a plate.

53:08.942 --> 53:10.111
Kyle will eat it.

53:10.143 --> 53:12.747
Man, you do not get
bigger than Disney.

53:12.779 --> 53:15.015
I know and they have a record
of putting indie directors

53:15.049 --> 53:16.984
at the helm of huge franchises.

53:17.017 --> 53:18.953
"Super" to "Guardians
of the Galaxy".

53:18.986 --> 53:20.955
"Cop Car" to
"Spider-Man Homecoming".

53:20.988 --> 53:23.223
"What We Do in the Shadows"
to "Thor Ragnarok".

53:23.256 --> 53:25.125
"Swingers to "Iron Man".

53:25.158 --> 53:26.294
Yeah.

53:26.326 --> 53:27.995
No well, Favreau didn't
direct "Swingers".

53:28.027 --> 53:29.830
He directed "Made"
and then "Elf"

53:29.863 --> 53:33.134
and then "Jumanji",
"Kids in Space".

53:33.167 --> 53:34.168
"Zathura".

53:34.201 --> 53:35.603
Why do I know that?

53:35.636 --> 53:36.237
Yeah.

53:36.270 --> 53:38.139
And then "Iron Man".

53:39.839 --> 53:41.341
Hey, I just got off
the phone with Nash.

53:41.375 --> 53:42.310
Is anyone eating that?

53:42.343 --> 53:43.143
Nope.

53:43.176 --> 53:44.578
All you.

53:44.611 --> 53:45.745
Anyway, he wants
you guys to come

53:45.779 --> 53:47.848
to the podcast recording.

53:47.881 --> 53:48.683

53:48.716 --> 53:49.884

53:51.085 --> 53:51.886

53:51.919 --> 53:53.087

54:50.277 --> 54:52.713
I am your host, Montgomery Nash,

54:52.745 --> 54:54.047
and our guest today
hails all the way

54:54.080 --> 54:55.915
from sunny Los
Angeles, California.

54:55.948 --> 54:58.718
He's part of the film crew
of "Unknown Unknowns",

54:58.752 --> 55:00.187
which just had its
world premiere here

55:00.219 --> 55:03.123
at the Hollywilde International
Film Festival of Cinema.

55:03.156 --> 55:05.125
It's wonderful to
welcome the winner

55:05.158 --> 55:07.093
of our Friends of Nash raffle.

55:07.127 --> 55:10.096
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Kyle the PA.

55:10.129 --> 55:10.997
Thank-

55:11.031 --> 55:12.866
- You know, Kyle, as
a director myself,

55:12.899 --> 55:16.202
I know how thankless,
seemingly useless,

55:16.236 --> 55:19.140
and basically shitty
your job can be as a PA.

55:19.172 --> 55:20.707
And yet it's still vital.

55:20.741 --> 55:23.444
Wouldn't you say so, Logan?

55:23.477 --> 55:25.179
I don't have a mic.

55:25.212 --> 55:26.013
Well tell you what.

55:26.046 --> 55:27.281
Why don't you just?

55:27.314 --> 55:29.049
Why don't you to just partner
up shotgun here to your buddy?

55:29.082 --> 55:29.883
Bring that.

55:29.917 --> 55:30.985
Tell you what.

55:31.018 --> 55:33.821
Just grab that apple box
and set it up New York style

55:33.853 --> 55:35.455
and we'll have a little
conversation with you.

55:35.489 --> 55:37.058
Yup, see this
gentleman knows exactly

55:37.091 --> 55:37.991
what I'm talking about.

55:38.024 --> 55:39.192
He knows his way around a set

55:39.225 --> 55:43.229
because this is the director,
writer, producer, editor,

55:43.263 --> 55:45.132
and star of "Unknown Unknowns".

55:45.165 --> 55:47.902
Please welcome to the
podcast Logan Clark.

55:47.935 --> 55:49.303
- Thanks for having me.
- Me too.

55:49.335 --> 55:52.238
Logan, what three
directors would you say

55:52.272 --> 55:54.808
that you most pattern
yourself after?

55:54.841 --> 55:57.243
That's always
a tough question.

55:57.277 --> 55:58.946
Probably Scorsese-

55:58.978 --> 55:59.879
- Nope.

55:59.913 --> 56:01.181
The correct answer is no one.

56:01.214 --> 56:04.250
You see, in order for a filmmaker
to truly find his voice,

56:04.283 --> 56:08.154
he must fail miserably and then
find his voice in the wake.

56:08.187 --> 56:09.723
Oh, wow.

56:09.756 --> 56:11.224
- Okay.
- Listen up, Kyle the PA.

56:11.257 --> 56:12.893
This applies to you, too.

56:12.926 --> 56:16.730
You know, we all fail,
but we must never give up.

56:17.931 --> 56:20.401
That's what they want
us to do and every no

56:20.433 --> 56:23.169
is just that much closer
to a yes and you know here

56:23.203 --> 56:25.973
at the Hollywilde International
Film Festival of Cinema,

56:26.006 --> 56:28.808
films come to life and
I'll tell you this much

56:28.841 --> 56:30.910
to anybody listening to the
sound of my voice right now.

56:30.944 --> 56:33.279
If I were a betting
man, I'd bet it all

56:33.312 --> 56:35.348
on "Unknown
Unknowns" selling big

56:35.381 --> 56:38.151
and saving independent cinema.

56:38.185 --> 56:39.520
Indie comedies are dead.

56:39.553 --> 56:40.353
I loved your film.

56:40.386 --> 56:41.287
I really did.

56:41.321 --> 56:43.089
The voices are strong and raw.

56:43.122 --> 56:43.923
And the images.

56:43.957 --> 56:44.859
I mean, wow.

56:44.892 --> 56:46.060
You guys should be proud.

56:46.093 --> 56:47.393
But there just isn't
much we can do with it.

56:47.426 --> 56:49.262
I mean, if there's no
explosion every six minutes,

56:49.296 --> 56:50.931
I can't sell Russia or China.

56:50.964 --> 56:51.866
Boom right there.

56:51.899 --> 56:53.100
That's half of your market.

56:53.134 --> 56:54.902
There is the runaway chance
that this has a sweeping run

56:54.935 --> 56:56.937
in the western
markets, US and Europe.

56:56.969 --> 56:58.004
Japan for some reason.

56:58.038 --> 56:59.206
We include them.

56:59.239 --> 57:00.775
You look at the research,
the likelihood of your film

57:00.808 --> 57:02.276
performing in any
of these markets

57:02.308 --> 57:05.044
is basically null and void if
you don't have Ryan Gosling.

57:05.078 --> 57:06.514
If you don't have Emma Stone.

57:06.547 --> 57:09.283
We need both Ryan
Gosling and Emma Stone.

57:09.315 --> 57:11.218
Because at the end of the day,

57:11.250 --> 57:13.353
we aren't selling a movie,
we're selling a poster.

57:13.386 --> 57:15.288
We're selling a trailer.

57:15.321 --> 57:17.290
We're selling Coca-Cola.

57:18.457 --> 57:20.326
No one gives a fuck
if your movie sucks.

57:20.359 --> 57:22.095
There are only five
genres that really sell.

57:22.129 --> 57:23.364
Female-driven thriller.

57:23.397 --> 57:24.465
Any action movie
where the poster

57:24.497 --> 57:25.899
has a guy with a gun in it.

57:25.933 --> 57:27.368
Family movies
with a talking dog.

57:27.401 --> 57:29.370
Any western with
like an old white guy

57:29.402 --> 57:30.370
and like a cool black guy.

57:30.404 --> 57:33.073
Baby adoption kidnapping
thrillers all day.

57:33.105 --> 57:34.575
Unless it's the best
film since "Pulp Fiction",

57:34.607 --> 57:36.243
the market serves one purpose.

57:36.276 --> 57:37.277
Butts in seats.

57:37.310 --> 57:38.312
That's it.

57:38.344 --> 57:40.047
Can I fill 2000
screens worldwide?

57:40.080 --> 57:42.348
And if I can't do that, can I
convince to 10 million people

57:42.381 --> 57:45.351
to spend 3.99 to watch it
in the next five years?

57:45.384 --> 57:48.321
If you're missing any of those
ingredients, our answer's no.

57:48.355 --> 57:49.423
We're gonna have to pass.

57:49.455 --> 57:51.558
I wish you luck, but
that's gonna be a no for me.

57:51.591 --> 57:53.459
If the world
wanted micro-budget,

57:53.493 --> 57:56.297
introspective journeys
by unknown auteurs,

57:56.330 --> 58:00.267
then I would buy it,
but they don't, so no.

58:00.299 --> 58:02.368
We'd love to add
it to our library.

58:02.402 --> 58:03.404
Really?

58:03.437 --> 58:04.238
That is such great news.

58:04.270 --> 58:05.171
Oh.

58:05.205 --> 58:08.142
How much were you thinking?

58:08.174 --> 58:09.475
Oh, zero.

58:09.509 --> 58:12.046
I mean like
guaranteed upfront.

58:12.078 --> 58:12.879
Yeah, zero.

58:12.913 --> 58:14.181
$0.

58:14.214 --> 58:14.848
American.

58:18.618 --> 58:21.354
To me, the real turning point

58:21.388 --> 58:23.023
was Favreau
directing "Iron Man".

58:23.056 --> 58:24.325
I mean, that was a
stroke of genius.

58:24.357 --> 58:26.026
You already have
all of the previous.

58:26.058 --> 58:27.527
Now let's bring the
characters to life.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.462
And I love that you guys
have been running with that.

58:29.495 --> 58:31.198
I mean, Taika, gun, Watts.

58:31.230 --> 58:32.899
It's amazing instinct.

58:32.933 --> 58:34.301
Well, I appreciate
that, Logan.

58:34.334 --> 58:36.169
I mean, it's not
exactly my department,

58:36.203 --> 58:38.405
but I'll pass it along.

58:38.437 --> 58:40.573
Well, so what have
you been working on?

58:40.607 --> 58:42.610
Oh, well I just
finally got a green light

58:42.643 --> 58:45.079
after fucking three
months of begging

58:45.111 --> 58:47.046
to adapt this Amy
Forrester novel.

58:47.080 --> 58:47.882
"Equity"?

58:47.915 --> 58:48.515
Yeah.

58:48.547 --> 58:51.317
It's my favorite book.

58:51.350 --> 58:52.252
No kidding.

58:52.285 --> 58:55.321
I have read it like 12 times.

58:55.355 --> 58:56.590
Wow.

58:56.622 --> 59:00.393
Well, we had Fincher attached
for awhile, but to be honest,

59:00.426 --> 59:04.397
he and the studio don't
exactly see eye to eye so.

59:04.431 --> 59:07.935
Well, I would absolutely
love to be considered.

59:07.968 --> 59:08.870
For what?

59:14.440 --> 59:16.310
To make your movie.

59:16.343 --> 59:17.310
For.

59:17.343 --> 59:19.112
Oh, for "Equity"?

59:19.145 --> 59:19.980
Yeah.

59:22.214 --> 59:23.450
To direct it?

59:24.651 --> 59:26.486
I thought that's what
we were talking about.

59:26.520 --> 59:27.688
I'm sorry.

59:27.721 --> 59:30.556
Kim said this was
about future projects.

59:30.589 --> 59:31.424
Oh.

59:35.462 --> 59:36.497
No.

59:38.431 --> 59:39.632
No.

59:39.665 --> 59:40.934
I've got Inarritu
attached to direct.

59:40.968 --> 59:42.335
Locked that down last week.

59:42.368 --> 59:43.504
No, but for you.

59:46.540 --> 59:47.909
I've got this.

59:52.546 --> 59:55.149
Jackal.

59:55.181 --> 59:57.183
Yeah, I have this
little side project.

59:57.216 --> 59:59.218
Deals mostly with online
marketing strategies

59:59.252 --> 1:00:00.454
and I would like to bring you in

1:00:00.486 --> 1:00:03.222
to be our signature director.

1:00:03.256 --> 1:00:08.328
13 spots, six seconds a
piece, 500 bucks a pop.

1:00:08.361 --> 1:00:09.363
What do you say?

1:00:51.471 --> 1:00:52.272
Bourbon apple sangria.

1:00:52.305 --> 1:00:54.274
You fucking serious?

1:00:55.741 --> 1:00:57.010
Cool flick.

1:00:58.611 --> 1:01:01.347
That scene with the cereal
bowl full of crickets.

1:01:01.381 --> 1:01:02.649
I was so confused.

1:01:02.681 --> 1:01:04.084
We loved that.

1:01:04.116 --> 1:01:05.319
I was like,
what is happening?

1:01:05.352 --> 1:01:06.553
We loved that.

1:01:06.585 --> 1:01:09.390
I mean, this is
my favorite film.

1:01:09.422 --> 1:01:12.091
This is my favorite
film of the festival.

1:01:12.125 --> 1:01:13.560
I wouldn't be surprised if
you guys are heading home

1:01:13.593 --> 1:01:17.397
with some hardware in
your luggage this week.

1:01:17.431 --> 1:01:19.767
My friends call me Monty.

1:01:27.674 --> 1:01:28.776
He kisses
everybody's ass.

1:01:28.808 --> 1:01:30.511
That's his style.

1:01:30.544 --> 1:01:32.346
You know, I really
thought for a minute there.

1:01:32.379 --> 1:01:33.147
What?

1:01:33.180 --> 1:01:34.547
That he liked your
movie the best?

1:01:34.580 --> 1:01:35.781
Yeah.

1:01:35.815 --> 1:01:39.520
Well he did, but he also liked
the Sundance movie the best

1:01:39.553 --> 1:01:42.321
and the British one
and the Nigerian one.

1:01:42.355 --> 1:01:44.224
I mean, every movie Nash
sees at his festival

1:01:44.256 --> 1:01:45.725
is his favorite movie.

1:01:45.759 --> 1:01:47.428
It's the nature of the beast.

1:01:47.460 --> 1:01:50.464
Onto the next, which is really
where your head should be.

1:01:50.497 --> 1:01:52.265
I mean, what do you
want to do next?

1:01:52.299 --> 1:01:53.100
A show?

1:01:53.132 --> 1:01:54.634
Another movie?

1:01:54.667 --> 1:01:55.468
Me.

1:01:57.837 --> 1:01:59.640
Hey.

1:01:59.672 --> 1:02:00.607
Can we talk?

1:02:01.575 --> 1:02:04.343
Hey Alex, this is Kim.

1:02:04.377 --> 1:02:06.447
- Kim, Alex.
- Oh, hey, great to meet you.

1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:07.448
She's head a programming.

1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:08.681
Oh hey, so nice to meet you.

1:02:08.714 --> 1:02:10.084
I really appreciate being here.

1:02:10.116 --> 1:02:10.716
It's okay.

1:02:10.750 --> 1:02:12.352
Great meeting you.

1:02:12.384 --> 1:02:15.288
Hey, before we get too
loaded, I may have some news.

1:02:15.321 --> 1:02:16.622
Hey.

1:02:16.656 --> 1:02:17.458
Hey.

1:02:17.491 --> 1:02:18.292
Hey, man.

1:02:18.325 --> 1:02:19.225
Hey, man.

1:02:19.259 --> 1:02:20.694
You're from that TV place?

1:02:20.727 --> 1:02:21.661
Okay man, sorry.

1:02:21.694 --> 1:02:23.830
You interrupted my friend here.

1:02:23.864 --> 1:02:25.466
Let me guess.

1:02:25.498 --> 1:02:28.267
You drove from the TV place
in your Mercedes-Benz.

1:02:28.301 --> 1:02:29.703
The TV place.

1:02:29.736 --> 1:02:31.172
Do you mean LA?

1:02:32.705 --> 1:02:34.173
Oh, oh.

1:02:34.207 --> 1:02:37.478
I'm sorry, Mr. Hollywood Elite.

1:02:37.511 --> 1:02:38.411
My bad.

1:02:38.444 --> 1:02:40.713
No, I think you're fine, man.

1:02:40.747 --> 1:02:46.520
Look, I feel like it's important
that you know I'm not rich.

1:02:46.553 --> 1:02:47.453
Okay?

1:02:47.486 --> 1:02:48.689
I don't do that for a living.

1:02:48.721 --> 1:02:50.123
I serve people food.

1:02:50.156 --> 1:02:53.593
And I eat out of a can
more than my cat does.

1:02:53.627 --> 1:02:56.529
How long have you been
knowing my friend Kim, hm?

1:02:56.562 --> 1:02:57.363
Oh.

1:02:58.864 --> 1:02:59.466
A day.

1:02:59.498 --> 1:03:00.567
Not long enough.

1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:01.768
Sorry.

1:03:01.801 --> 1:03:03.437
He's the local town
idiot being protective.

1:03:03.469 --> 1:03:05.471
Blade, he's all right.

1:03:05.504 --> 1:03:06.405
Wait a minute.

1:03:06.439 --> 1:03:08.308
Your name is Blade?

1:03:08.341 --> 1:03:09.609
Is that real?

1:03:09.643 --> 1:03:10.577
Like from a baby?

1:03:10.609 --> 1:03:11.577
Baby Blade.

1:03:11.611 --> 1:03:13.814
Hey, let's not poke the bear.

1:03:13.846 --> 1:03:15.314
We have a problem here?

1:03:15.348 --> 1:03:16.216
Is that what's going on?

1:03:16.248 --> 1:03:17.884
Oh, okay, man.

1:03:17.917 --> 1:03:18.751
Listen.

1:03:19.685 --> 1:03:21.388
Listen.

1:03:21.421 --> 1:03:26.560
My only problem is that
you are a walking cliche

1:03:26.593 --> 1:03:29.263
and your choices are obvious.

1:03:29.296 --> 1:03:30.531
Like if you were auditioning

1:03:30.564 --> 1:03:31.931
for the role of local town bully

1:03:31.964 --> 1:03:33.600
in a movie that I was casting,

1:03:33.632 --> 1:03:37.603
I would ask you politely
to tone it down.

1:03:37.636 --> 1:03:39.272
This is too much, man.

1:03:39.306 --> 1:03:41.341
It's like you saw "Back
to the "Future" once

1:03:41.373 --> 1:03:43.377
and you were like
fuck yeah Biff,

1:03:43.410 --> 1:03:44.344
but don't get me wrong, man.

1:03:44.377 --> 1:03:45.679
I love a good bully.

1:03:45.712 --> 1:03:48.614
I mean, you got Ace
Merrill, John Bender,

1:03:48.647 --> 1:03:52.285
even Johnny Lawrence,
man, but you.

1:03:52.319 --> 1:03:54.421
You're more of an O'Doyle.

1:03:54.453 --> 1:03:55.756
You're like Deebo.

1:03:55.788 --> 1:03:59.526
You are a deductive,
an original device

1:03:59.558 --> 1:04:02.196
that I have seen
thousands of times over.

1:04:02.228 --> 1:04:05.732
And I don't know if it's
the beer or just my words,

1:04:05.765 --> 1:04:07.600
but let me make
it simple for you.

1:04:07.634 --> 1:04:09.836
You are underwritten.

1:04:09.868 --> 1:04:10.502
Ow.

1:04:11.971 --> 1:04:13.739
Blade, what the fuck?

1:04:13.772 --> 1:04:14.607
Ow.

1:04:17.843 --> 1:04:19.546
How would
you shoot that?

1:04:19.578 --> 1:04:20.413
That.

1:04:22.248 --> 1:04:25.285
Dirty overs and a wide.

1:04:25.317 --> 1:04:26.486
Not too cutty.

1:04:27.721 --> 1:04:29.989
Get into the action.

1:04:30.022 --> 1:04:30.857
Close.

1:04:31.924 --> 1:04:33.693
Too close.

1:04:33.727 --> 1:04:37.397
Buzz critical focus to
feel the inebriation.

1:04:40.634 --> 1:04:42.969
How are you only 15 years old?

1:04:43.002 --> 1:04:46.739
I spent most of my
life looking at screens.

1:04:48.274 --> 1:04:51.611
Poor parenting makes
the best artists,

1:04:54.614 --> 1:04:56.382
but seriously, where the
fuck are your parents?

1:04:57.951 --> 1:04:59.353
Who fights
at film festival?

1:04:59.386 --> 1:05:00.286
No.

1:05:00.319 --> 1:05:01.654
Can you call that a fight?

1:05:01.687 --> 1:05:03.289
At least Logan shamed him

1:05:03.323 --> 1:05:06.627
with all those encyclopedic
references to cinema.

1:05:06.660 --> 1:05:08.828
Shamed him enough for
him to abandon his words.

1:05:08.861 --> 1:05:09.662
Yeah.

1:05:09.696 --> 1:05:10.596
Okay.

1:05:10.629 --> 1:05:11.864
This is us, so thank you, Kim.

1:05:11.897 --> 1:05:13.566
Oh, no problem.

1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:16.036
Tomorrow I'll introduce you
to some drunker, bigger guys.

1:05:16.069 --> 1:05:18.772
Hey, you sure we
can't offer you a ride home?

1:05:18.805 --> 1:05:20.339
I'm gonna walk.

1:05:20.372 --> 1:05:21.374
All right, cool.

1:05:21.408 --> 1:05:22.676
Hey, say good night, Logan.

1:05:22.709 --> 1:05:23.877
I was actually thinking

1:05:23.910 --> 1:05:26.879
that Logan might
wanna walk me home.

1:05:35.087 --> 1:05:36.856
Maybe another time.

1:05:38.058 --> 1:05:41.262
Man, I thought you
guys wanted to win.

1:05:44.397 --> 1:05:45.032
Kidding.

1:05:49.736 --> 1:05:51.038
You really got us.

1:05:51.071 --> 1:05:53.406
Yeah, that was funny.

1:05:53.439 --> 1:05:54.340
Good night, Kim.

1:05:54.373 --> 1:05:55.709
It was real nice meeting you.

1:05:55.741 --> 1:05:57.410
You, too.

1:05:57.444 --> 1:06:00.980
Hey, maybe they'll have
an award for most boring.

1:06:01.013 --> 1:06:02.716
Have a good night.

1:06:07.654 --> 1:06:09.489
Are you serious?

1:06:09.522 --> 1:06:10.824
She's got a weird
sense of humor.

1:06:10.857 --> 1:06:12.492
No, no, no, not her. You.

1:06:12.524 --> 1:06:14.660
Maybe another time?

1:06:14.694 --> 1:06:16.697
You told me to suck her dick.

1:06:16.730 --> 1:06:17.964
Not literally.

1:06:17.997 --> 1:06:21.500
You literally said literally.

1:06:21.533 --> 1:06:23.636
I didn't do anything.

1:06:23.669 --> 1:06:24.771
Just drop it.

1:06:39.819 --> 1:06:42.089
What'd you want to tell me?

1:06:42.122 --> 1:06:44.056
How could I forget?

1:06:44.089 --> 1:06:44.890
Oh, that's right.

1:06:44.924 --> 1:06:45.959
Violence.

1:06:49.895 --> 1:06:52.498
We may have a buyer.

1:06:52.531 --> 1:06:53.566
Seriously?

1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:54.668
Yeah.

1:06:54.701 --> 1:06:56.770
Yeah, they love the movie.

1:06:56.803 --> 1:06:59.005
They're a free streaming app

1:06:59.038 --> 1:07:00.741
and all they wanna do
is change the ending,

1:07:00.774 --> 1:07:02.808
crop out the nudity and chop
it into 10 minute vignettes

1:07:02.841 --> 1:07:04.977
so they can sell online ads.

1:07:10.417 --> 1:07:11.918
Okay.

1:07:11.951 --> 1:07:15.489
So obviously you told
them to fuck off.

1:07:15.522 --> 1:07:16.656
Hang on.

1:07:16.689 --> 1:07:17.524
What?

1:07:17.556 --> 1:07:18.158
No.

1:07:18.190 --> 1:07:18.991
Okay.

1:07:19.024 --> 1:07:20.660
No way.

1:07:20.692 --> 1:07:23.497
Okay, this is a real
offer from the real world.

1:07:23.529 --> 1:07:24.997
It's a deal.

1:07:25.031 --> 1:07:26.632
Yeah, for them.

1:07:27.933 --> 1:07:28.768
Fuck.

1:07:38.111 --> 1:07:41.147
Did you even call anyone else?

1:07:41.181 --> 1:07:44.751
Where do you think
I have been all day?

1:07:44.783 --> 1:07:46.986
I called every
distributor in the world.

1:07:47.020 --> 1:07:49.156
All my meetings
today were a bust.

1:07:49.189 --> 1:07:51.725
No one offered
any money upfront.

1:07:51.757 --> 1:07:54.160
This is our best and only offer.

1:07:54.194 --> 1:07:56.962
So once again I'm
left with a choice

1:07:56.995 --> 1:08:00.767
that's not really a choice
because you're the business.

1:08:00.799 --> 1:08:01.968
The business of killing art.

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:02.902
Hey, you know what?

1:08:02.935 --> 1:08:04.603
Your art.

1:08:04.636 --> 1:08:06.006
It doesn't come to life
without me securing money

1:08:06.038 --> 1:08:08.642
and contracts and
locations and equipment

1:08:08.674 --> 1:08:11.812
and a fucking vegan
option for your actress.

1:08:11.844 --> 1:08:13.180
Killing art.

1:08:13.212 --> 1:08:14.881
You think I'm in
this for the money?

1:08:14.913 --> 1:08:16.649
I am fucking broke.

1:08:16.683 --> 1:08:18.084
You had your identity stolen.

1:08:18.117 --> 1:08:19.085
You'll get your money back.

1:08:19.117 --> 1:08:19.986
It happens all the time.

1:08:20.019 --> 1:08:21.021
No, no, no.

1:08:21.054 --> 1:08:22.456
I am busted.

1:08:22.488 --> 1:08:23.622
Okay.

1:08:23.656 --> 1:08:24.558
Because all the
money from investors,

1:08:24.590 --> 1:08:26.225
it just it never came through.

1:08:26.259 --> 1:08:28.895
So all of this
money is all debt.

1:08:28.928 --> 1:08:29.996
It is all credit cards.

1:08:30.028 --> 1:08:30.863
It is all loans.

1:08:30.897 --> 1:08:32.131
I am in the red.

1:08:32.165 --> 1:08:35.602
I am like deeply
hemorrhaging red.

1:08:35.635 --> 1:08:37.537
So if this doesn't work out,

1:08:37.569 --> 1:08:42.041
then you might feel bad about
yourself, but I am fucked.

1:08:43.675 --> 1:08:45.644
Why didn't you tell me?

1:08:45.678 --> 1:08:46.979
Because we were.

1:08:48.147 --> 1:08:51.751
We were two weeks
away from production.

1:08:51.783 --> 1:08:53.853
I felt like I failed you.

1:08:55.054 --> 1:08:56.523
I've never done this.

1:08:56.555 --> 1:08:59.992
I've never successfully
raised money for a movie.

1:09:00.026 --> 1:09:02.595
No one takes me
seriously, not even you.

1:09:02.629 --> 1:09:03.229
Yeah, I do.

1:09:03.263 --> 1:09:05.232
No, you do not.

1:09:05.264 --> 1:09:06.899
You have never
respected my opinion,

1:09:06.933 --> 1:09:10.036
despite the fact that I am
always looking out for you.

1:09:10.068 --> 1:09:10.970
Give me one example.

1:09:11.004 --> 1:09:12.038
Okay.

1:09:13.206 --> 1:09:14.007
Your dick.

1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:15.007
What?

1:09:15.041 --> 1:09:16.643
In the movie.

1:09:16.675 --> 1:09:18.143
Look, a guy's dick is only funny

1:09:18.176 --> 1:09:21.113
if it is like pathetically
small or impossibly humongous,

1:09:21.147 --> 1:09:24.050
and in the context of your
character being depressed,

1:09:24.082 --> 1:09:26.085
the dick should have been
resting on the balls.

1:09:26.118 --> 1:09:27.953
But no, there is clearly a gap

1:09:27.987 --> 1:09:29.890
between the dick and the balls.

1:09:29.922 --> 1:09:31.224
And I remember telling you.

1:09:31.256 --> 1:09:33.759
I said, Logan, you are
fluffing it too much,

1:09:33.792 --> 1:09:36.996
but oh no, no, your ego has
to come before the movie.

1:09:37.029 --> 1:09:38.732
So now the audience
is left confused

1:09:38.764 --> 1:09:41.867
and I'm left with a movie
that is way less marketable,

1:09:41.901 --> 1:09:44.004
but hey, you know,
at least your wee wee

1:09:44.037 --> 1:09:47.541
looked above average for
all the festival groupies.

1:09:47.573 --> 1:09:49.608
Everything is all about you.

1:09:49.642 --> 1:09:50.742
And you know what?

1:09:50.777 --> 1:09:53.680
I actually, I don't mind
playing second fiddle to you,

1:09:53.712 --> 1:09:56.550
but for once I would
like some respect.

1:09:56.582 --> 1:09:58.617
I would like some credit

1:09:58.651 --> 1:10:00.754
because you never even
said thank you once,

1:10:00.787 --> 1:10:03.756
you selfish fucking prick.

1:10:07.827 --> 1:10:09.296
Hey, where are you going?

1:10:09.328 --> 1:10:10.697
None of your business.

1:10:10.729 --> 1:10:12.165
Oh, you gonna go fuck
that nice lady now?

1:10:12.197 --> 1:10:16.102
I no longer require
your personal assistance.

1:10:20.639 --> 1:10:24.143
You're being an
asshole to both of them.

1:10:41.193 --> 1:10:41.995
Hey, bud.

1:10:42.028 --> 1:10:43.029
How you doing?

1:10:43.062 --> 1:10:44.831
How can I help you?

1:10:46.099 --> 1:10:51.171
Can I get that bottle of Oak
Ridge and a box of condoms?

1:10:52.205 --> 1:10:54.274
That's
a fun combo, man.

1:10:54.306 --> 1:10:56.910
Is that a magnum
you're looking for?

1:10:56.943 --> 1:10:57.877
You know what?

1:10:57.910 --> 1:10:58.810
I already have some magnums.

1:10:58.845 --> 1:11:00.180
So if you could just
do the regular ones,

1:11:00.212 --> 1:11:02.047
that's probably
that's good for me.

1:11:02.081 --> 1:11:02.882
I got options then.

1:11:02.915 --> 1:11:04.216
Right.

1:11:16.362 --> 1:11:18.031
Hey, Logan.

1:11:18.063 --> 1:11:18.898
What's up?

1:11:19.866 --> 1:11:21.368
YOLO, right?

1:11:21.401 --> 1:11:23.202
Oh.

1:11:23.236 --> 1:11:26.171
Yeah, but you were going home.

1:11:26.205 --> 1:11:28.341
I guess I changed my mind.

1:11:30.175 --> 1:11:31.210
Okay.

1:11:32.879 --> 1:11:34.314
You did invite me over, right?

1:11:34.346 --> 1:11:37.684
Yeah, I did, but
you shot me down,

1:11:37.716 --> 1:11:39.786
so I asked somebody else.

1:11:41.254 --> 1:11:42.889
Really?

1:11:42.921 --> 1:11:44.991
Look, I'm just trying
to have a little fun.

1:11:45.023 --> 1:11:46.425
I mean, between this
and the music festival,

1:11:46.459 --> 1:11:50.196
I only get to
feast twice a year.

1:11:50.229 --> 1:11:52.799
I'm fucking with you, Logan.

1:11:52.831 --> 1:11:55.334
But yeah, seriously.

1:11:55.367 --> 1:11:56.169
Sorry.

1:11:59.938 --> 1:12:01.273
Understood.

1:12:01.306 --> 1:12:02.108
Okay.

1:12:02.140 --> 1:12:03.977
Well I'm probably gonna.

1:12:04.010 --> 1:12:06.346
Oh yeah, yeah.

1:12:06.379 --> 1:12:07.680
Okay.

1:12:10.248 --> 1:12:11.317
Have fun.

1:12:11.349 --> 1:12:12.251
Oh.

1:12:14.019 --> 1:12:15.388
Thanks.

1:12:15.420 --> 1:12:17.123
Yeah, all right.

1:12:23.229 --> 1:12:24.064
All right.

1:12:25.331 --> 1:12:26.166
Well.

1:12:39.946 --> 1:12:41.247
You piece of shit.

1:12:43.483 --> 1:12:44.317
Come on.

1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:49.355
Stupid.

1:13:09.942 --> 1:13:12.312
Hey, can we just do
apologies tomorrow, please?

1:13:12.345 --> 1:13:14.080
Because you're not gonna believe

1:13:14.112 --> 1:13:18.784
how excited I am for
the award show tomorrow.

1:13:18.818 --> 1:13:20.287
And now you're here?

1:13:21.287 --> 1:13:22.989
What did you do?

1:13:25.491 --> 1:13:28.027
What did Alex say I did?

1:13:28.059 --> 1:13:28.861
Doesn't matter.

1:13:28.894 --> 1:13:30.730
I see it on your face.

1:13:32.230 --> 1:13:33.500
Why are you fighting?

1:13:33.532 --> 1:13:35.234
You could've died.

1:13:36.434 --> 1:13:37.504
Does it hurt?

1:13:42.175 --> 1:13:42.976
I'm sorry.

1:13:46.946 --> 1:13:50.117
I'm sorry for
missing your premiere.

1:13:51.216 --> 1:13:52.018
Wait, I don't understand.

1:13:52.050 --> 1:13:52.951
How are you here?

1:13:52.984 --> 1:13:53.987
I thought you had to present.

1:13:54.019 --> 1:13:54.953
Oh, they settled.

1:13:54.987 --> 1:13:57.390
I'll tell you about it later.

1:13:57.422 --> 1:13:59.526
Let me get you some ice, okay.

1:13:59.559 --> 1:14:01.294
That looks really bad.

1:14:06.064 --> 1:14:07.968
I'm glad you're back.

1:14:09.402 --> 1:14:10.237
Me, too.

1:14:13.939 --> 1:14:15.407
Look, about earlier.

1:14:17.076 --> 1:14:18.211
I know I'm a lot of work.

1:14:18.243 --> 1:14:19.278
No shit.

1:14:21.246 --> 1:14:23.816
But also I'm sorry that I lied.

1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:28.921
I'm awake.

1:14:28.955 --> 1:14:30.422
I'm sorry.

1:14:30.456 --> 1:14:31.257
Jesus.

1:14:31.290 --> 1:14:32.325
Come on.

1:14:32.358 --> 1:14:34.327
I didn't know when it
was a good time to leave.

1:14:34.359 --> 1:14:36.429
I was waiting for a lull.

1:14:39.431 --> 1:14:41.099
There was no lull.

1:14:49.642 --> 1:14:51.845
Are you sure you don't want
to stay for the award show?

1:14:51.877 --> 1:14:55.014
Nah, I got to catch
a flight to South Bay.

1:14:55.046 --> 1:14:57.317
It was good meeting you, Tom.

1:14:57.349 --> 1:14:59.285
Great meeting you, too, kid.

1:15:04.290 --> 1:15:07.160
Max, try to read
up on your history.

1:15:07.193 --> 1:15:08.261
I will.

1:15:08.294 --> 1:15:10.897
Try to keep up with the future.

1:15:14.466 --> 1:15:15.301
Shit.

1:15:16.635 --> 1:15:17.469
Shit.

1:15:19.471 --> 1:15:20.372
Oh, fuck.

1:15:22.174 --> 1:15:23.844
He's my best friend.

1:15:25.243 --> 1:15:28.147
Ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the 12th annual

1:15:28.179 --> 1:15:32.251
Hollywilde International Film
Festival of Cinema award show.

1:15:35.654 --> 1:15:37.523
It is my pleasure to
introduce the founder

1:15:37.555 --> 1:15:40.893
and director Mr.
Montgomery Nash.

1:15:47.666 --> 1:15:50.035
Thank you very much, Kim.

1:15:50.068 --> 1:15:52.304
By the way, I should say
that's not our music.

1:15:52.337 --> 1:15:53.473
Kim is just so beautiful,

1:15:53.505 --> 1:15:57.075
the music plays
everywhere she walks.

1:15:57.108 --> 1:16:00.946
Very, very, very,
very beautiful woman.

1:16:00.979 --> 1:16:04.616
Not that that's her only
function as far as I'm concerned.

1:16:04.649 --> 1:16:06.252
As an individual.

1:16:08.621 --> 1:16:09.989
Women in film.

1:16:11.224 --> 1:16:14.494
Well, I think right now would
be a really good time for me

1:16:14.527 --> 1:16:17.430
to bring up my super
secret celebrity co-host

1:16:17.462 --> 1:16:19.532
and dear personal friend.

1:16:19.564 --> 1:16:22.367
Ladies and gentlemen, the
legendary, the talented,

1:16:22.401 --> 1:16:25.171
the beautiful Miss
Rachel Leigh Cook.

1:16:34.412 --> 1:16:36.281
Hey, she doesn't
just have the music.

1:16:36.314 --> 1:16:37.215
It looks like she
brought her own

1:16:37.248 --> 1:16:39.484
wrap around lighting package.

1:16:39.518 --> 1:16:41.154
With the, you know.

1:16:41.187 --> 1:16:44.390
Soft lighting is a gal's
best friend and a person's.

1:16:44.422 --> 1:16:48.161
Would you mind saying
some words, Rachel?

1:16:48.193 --> 1:16:49.028
Hi.

1:16:50.062 --> 1:16:52.497
It's my first time here.

1:16:52.531 --> 1:16:55.268
Oh, it's so beautiful.

1:16:55.300 --> 1:16:59.071
I really wanted to come
out as a proud supporter

1:16:59.104 --> 1:17:03.276
of Montgomery's amazing
charity, Friends of Nash.

1:17:03.309 --> 1:17:04.711
And I gotta say I
was pretty surprised

1:17:04.743 --> 1:17:08.714
when he asked me to co-host
tonight's award ceremony.

1:17:08.747 --> 1:17:12.484
Not that surprised
because we'd been speaking

1:17:12.518 --> 1:17:14.520
as friends for a
long time about it

1:17:14.553 --> 1:17:17.156
because we are close
personal friends and cohorts.

1:17:17.188 --> 1:17:18.257
So, she knew.

1:17:21.626 --> 1:17:23.528
And we're here so.

1:17:23.562 --> 1:17:25.497
Is she like a player
in independent films?

1:17:25.531 --> 1:17:27.567
To all
of the filmmakers.

1:17:27.599 --> 1:17:28.500
Sh.

1:17:28.533 --> 1:17:29.335
And your wonderful work.

1:17:29.367 --> 1:17:30.335
And congratulations
to you, Monty.

1:17:30.368 --> 1:17:33.305
What you've done here
is absolutely amazing.

1:17:33.339 --> 1:17:34.174
Oh.

1:17:37.309 --> 1:17:42.315
And your obvious passion for
film is impossible to ignore.

1:17:43.482 --> 1:17:44.484
Seriously.

1:17:44.517 --> 1:17:45.484
So, thank you.

1:17:48.453 --> 1:17:49.589
Rachel Leigh Cook,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:17:49.621 --> 1:17:50.522
Right here.

1:17:52.323 --> 1:17:53.158
Rachel Leigh Cook.

1:17:56.228 --> 1:17:58.565
Hey, she really is all that.

1:18:00.465 --> 1:18:01.533
I get it.

1:18:01.567 --> 1:18:03.036
Well, you know, it takes a lot

1:18:03.068 --> 1:18:04.569
to put a festival
like this together.

1:18:04.603 --> 1:18:05.505
Believe me, I should know.

1:18:05.537 --> 1:18:06.638
It's a lot of moving parts.

1:18:06.671 --> 1:18:08.440
So before we go any further,

1:18:08.474 --> 1:18:10.176
I would like to invite my staff

1:18:10.209 --> 1:18:12.545
and all of our volunteers up
here to share some thank yous

1:18:12.577 --> 1:18:14.613
and say a few
words individually,

1:18:14.647 --> 1:18:16.683
one at a time individually.

1:18:25.123 --> 1:18:26.492
I needed a break.

1:18:26.524 --> 1:18:27.626
What's happening now?

1:18:27.660 --> 1:18:28.627
Oh, they're showing
that short doc

1:18:28.661 --> 1:18:29.796
about a cancer survivor.

1:18:29.828 --> 1:18:31.496
It's actually like
super powerful.

1:18:31.529 --> 1:18:34.466
I just like was
not ready for it.

1:18:40.473 --> 1:18:42.341
Oliver Samson,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:18:42.373 --> 1:18:44.242
Hey Ollie, you should
keep the bald head.

1:18:44.276 --> 1:18:45.778
Looks bad ass.

1:18:45.810 --> 1:18:49.614
I've got to because
of the chemotherapy.

1:18:49.648 --> 1:18:50.817
I know that.

1:18:52.651 --> 1:18:53.553
Why wouldn't?

1:18:53.586 --> 1:18:54.520
Why wouldn't I know that?

1:18:54.553 --> 1:18:55.354
Have a seat.

1:18:55.386 --> 1:18:56.589
Okay.

1:18:56.621 --> 1:18:59.491
Hey, a blessing in
disguise some would.

1:19:00.593 --> 1:19:01.493
Okay.

1:19:01.527 --> 1:19:04.596
Now onto best cinematography.

1:19:04.630 --> 1:19:05.631
You okay?

1:19:05.663 --> 1:19:08.233
I'm really nervous.

1:19:08.267 --> 1:19:11.604
It's like this actually
matters to me or something.

1:19:11.636 --> 1:19:12.638
That's a good thing.

1:19:12.670 --> 1:19:14.639
Not if I lose.

1:19:14.672 --> 1:19:15.608
Max Ferber.

1:19:23.648 --> 1:19:24.649
Max, couldn't be here,

1:19:24.684 --> 1:19:28.554
but he asked me to accept
this on his behalf.

1:19:28.586 --> 1:19:30.555
Remember his name because
I believe we'll all

1:19:30.589 --> 1:19:32.625
be working for him one day.

1:19:33.725 --> 1:19:34.861
Max Ferber.

1:19:38.296 --> 1:19:40.700
Oh by the way, I'm not Swedish.

1:19:41.599 --> 1:19:43.301
But I am.

1:19:43.335 --> 1:19:46.139
I just actually I pushed the
envelope just a little bit.

1:19:50.442 --> 1:19:53.379
We are all
originally from Africa.

1:19:53.412 --> 1:19:55.715
This is for Africa.

1:19:58.850 --> 1:20:03.790
Thank you for this but I
reject being labeled an actress.

1:20:04.924 --> 1:20:06.192
I'm an actor.

1:20:07.358 --> 1:20:08.460
If you were sick,
you wouldn't go

1:20:08.493 --> 1:20:10.496
to a doctoress now would you?

1:20:10.528 --> 1:20:12.431
Who here saw my film?

1:20:18.304 --> 1:20:20.706
You should see my film.

1:20:20.738 --> 1:20:21.773
It's important.

1:20:23.209 --> 1:20:24.644
People are dying.

1:20:28.380 --> 1:20:30.449
Five fucking hours,
still no awards.

1:20:30.482 --> 1:20:31.283
This is it.

1:20:31.317 --> 1:20:31.917
Best director.

1:20:31.951 --> 1:20:33.019
This is you.

1:20:33.051 --> 1:20:34.886
Well, I don't want to
speak for Rachel Leigh Cook,

1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:39.392
but I know that I can't hardly
wait for this next category.

1:20:43.229 --> 1:20:45.198
I'm not in that movie.

1:20:51.870 --> 1:20:53.573
All right.

1:20:53.605 --> 1:20:56.975
It's time for best director
and don't worry, everyone.

1:20:57.009 --> 1:20:59.578
I wasn't nominated this year.

1:21:03.616 --> 1:21:04.817
The winner is.

1:21:09.822 --> 1:21:11.757
Sarah Kinsey "Obfuscate".

1:21:29.308 --> 1:21:30.743
This is so stupid.

1:21:30.776 --> 1:21:33.613
I think I'm more upset
that I actually care.

1:21:33.645 --> 1:21:35.014
It's okay to care.

1:21:39.852 --> 1:21:43.421
Try to remember
what really matters.

1:21:43.455 --> 1:21:44.790
You didn't almost kill yourself

1:21:44.822 --> 1:21:47.593
making this movie
for some award.

1:21:47.626 --> 1:21:49.996
Making the movie was the award.

1:21:51.429 --> 1:21:52.731
Remember all those
nights you didn't

1:21:52.764 --> 1:21:54.299
even wanna watch TV with me

1:21:54.332 --> 1:21:56.736
because you were
too excited to write

1:21:56.769 --> 1:21:58.504
and then shooting
in different places

1:21:58.537 --> 1:22:00.439
and forgetting to eat and sleep

1:22:00.471 --> 1:22:05.010
because you were too busy
doing what you loved.

1:22:05.044 --> 1:22:06.879
You took an idea from your brain

1:22:06.912 --> 1:22:09.682
and you turned it into a thing.

1:22:10.616 --> 1:22:11.684
You did that.

1:22:13.786 --> 1:22:15.020
That's the prize.

1:22:16.822 --> 1:22:18.291
You're right.

1:22:19.457 --> 1:22:20.792
I don't need some fucking-

1:22:20.826 --> 1:22:21.627
We won.

1:22:21.660 --> 1:22:22.193
Get in here.

1:22:22.227 --> 1:22:23.296
- What?
- Best film.

1:22:23.328 --> 1:22:23.929
We fucking won.

1:22:23.961 --> 1:22:25.129
Oh my God.

1:22:25.162 --> 1:22:26.998
- Best film, babe. Best film.
- I forgot about best film.

1:22:27.032 --> 1:22:28.401
I forgot about it.

1:22:28.434 --> 1:22:29.335
I love you.

1:22:29.367 --> 1:22:29.968
I love you.

1:22:30.001 --> 1:22:30.803
Go, go, you go.

1:22:30.836 --> 1:22:31.737
You gotta be there.

1:22:31.769 --> 1:22:32.904
All right, all right.

1:22:34.773 --> 1:22:35.975
Congratulations, Logan.

1:22:36.007 --> 1:22:38.010
It's some of your best work.

1:22:38.042 --> 1:22:38.844
Thank you.

1:22:38.876 --> 1:22:39.745
Woo.

1:22:39.778 --> 1:22:41.013
Congratulations.

1:22:41.045 --> 1:22:43.815
Thank you, Rachel Leigh Cook.

1:22:44.782 --> 1:22:47.085
Wow, I really was
not expecting this.

1:22:47.118 --> 1:22:47.953
Best film.

1:22:50.688 --> 1:22:52.924
Jesus, I didn't realize how
much this would affect me.

1:22:54.926 --> 1:22:58.563
I came here thinking I was
bigger than this festival.

1:22:58.596 --> 1:23:05.970
I was critical and judgmental,
but we are all so similar.

1:23:06.004 --> 1:23:08.707
I mean, we're all here.

1:23:09.841 --> 1:23:13.946
How many people here make
a living making movies?

1:23:15.913 --> 1:23:18.818
Yeah, we are not in
competition with each other.

1:23:18.850 --> 1:23:22.554
We beg, borrow, steal
and do whatever it takes

1:23:22.587 --> 1:23:24.622
to bring our story to life,

1:23:24.656 --> 1:23:27.760
but none of us know what
the hell is going on

1:23:27.792 --> 1:23:31.096
or what's gonna get made
or if it'll even work.

1:23:31.130 --> 1:23:32.531
And then once we're done,

1:23:32.563 --> 1:23:34.566
we don't know if anyone
is even gonna see it,

1:23:34.599 --> 1:23:36.835
and if they do, they
don't wanna pay for it,

1:23:36.868 --> 1:23:39.505
even though we are all broke.

1:23:41.038 --> 1:23:43.576
I may be holding this award,

1:23:44.742 --> 1:23:49.748
but everyone in this
room is a winner.

1:23:49.782 --> 1:23:54.920
We made something from nothing

1:23:54.952 --> 1:24:01.026
and none of us
did it on our own.

1:24:01.059 --> 1:24:06.431
This award belongs to my
director of photography.

1:24:06.465 --> 1:24:09.635
Tom Jonsson, the
best eye in the west.

1:24:10.836 --> 1:24:14.106
This award belongs to and I
cannot believe I'm saying this.

1:24:14.139 --> 1:24:20.813
Kyle the PA, your presence
on set was never not known.

1:24:20.845 --> 1:24:23.114
But truly this award belongs

1:24:23.148 --> 1:24:27.520
to Alexandria
Davis, my producer,

1:24:27.553 --> 1:24:30.523
but more importantly, my friend.

1:24:31.622 --> 1:24:34.727
Without you, this movie
would never have been made.

1:24:42.033 --> 1:24:44.836
To making movies and
hopefully figuring out

1:24:44.870 --> 1:24:47.973
a more sustainable business
model for making them.

1:24:55.880 --> 1:24:59.617
Wow, what an incredible
year for cinema.

1:24:59.651 --> 1:25:01.120
Well, that's our show.

1:25:01.153 --> 1:25:03.222
Goodnight, everybod...

1:25:03.255 --> 1:25:06.559
Not so fast there, Mr. Nash.

1:25:06.591 --> 1:25:09.728
The festival has one
more award to hand out.

1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:10.562
What?

1:25:10.595 --> 1:25:11.763
What do you mean?

1:25:11.796 --> 1:25:13.898
I don't have this
reflected in my notes.

1:25:13.931 --> 1:25:15.201
What's going on?

1:25:15.233 --> 1:25:18.470
Well, this week has been
all about the filmmakers

1:25:18.504 --> 1:25:21.841
and not nearly enough about
the festival's creator,

1:25:21.873 --> 1:25:25.176
Mr. Montgomery Nash, so we
would like to take this time

1:25:25.210 --> 1:25:30.983
to recognize his incredible
contribution with this,

1:25:31.015 --> 1:25:34.519
the Hollywilde
International Film Festival

1:25:35.987 --> 1:25:40.758
of Cinema magnanimous award.

1:25:40.791 --> 1:25:42.227
Okay, wow.

1:25:42.260 --> 1:25:44.062
What?

1:25:44.095 --> 1:25:44.929
Excuse me, sir.

1:25:44.962 --> 1:25:46.064
Excuse me.

1:25:46.098 --> 1:25:47.800
Ollie, could you keep it down?

1:25:49.934 --> 1:25:53.205
You know, Timothy Busfield
is a mentor of mine.

1:25:53.237 --> 1:25:54.939
Hey, hold this for one second.

1:25:54.973 --> 1:25:56.007
I gotta go schmooze.

1:25:56.041 --> 1:25:57.142
Have you seen Amy?

1:25:57.175 --> 1:25:58.878
Logan.

1:25:58.911 --> 1:25:59.812
Hey.

1:25:59.845 --> 1:26:00.813
Hello.

1:26:00.845 --> 1:26:01.647
Hi.

1:26:01.679 --> 1:26:02.747
Hi.

1:26:02.781 --> 1:26:03.616
Oh.

1:26:04.550 --> 1:26:05.584
Thank you.

1:26:05.617 --> 1:26:06.819
You're welcome.

1:26:06.852 --> 1:26:08.854
Hey, I didn't get
to hear your speech.

1:26:08.886 --> 1:26:11.023
We were having all these
technical issues in the back,

1:26:11.055 --> 1:26:13.925
but I wanted to say congrats.

1:26:13.959 --> 1:26:16.828
Yes, I will accept that.

1:26:17.162 --> 1:26:18.363
Okay, good.

1:26:18.397 --> 1:26:21.634
Hey, look, I'm really sorry
about what happened last night,

1:26:21.666 --> 1:26:23.701
but if you wanted
to come over later,

1:26:23.734 --> 1:26:26.071
I was able to salvage
some of those condoms

1:26:26.104 --> 1:26:28.574
that I assume you spilled
out by my trashcan.

1:26:28.607 --> 1:26:29.242
Logan.

1:26:30.309 --> 1:26:31.176
Logan.

1:26:31.209 --> 1:26:32.010
Who is this?

1:26:32.044 --> 1:26:33.112
Oh God, don't tell me.

1:26:33.144 --> 1:26:34.045
This is-

1:26:34.078 --> 1:26:36.081
- I'm Amy, Logan's girlfriend.

1:26:36.113 --> 1:26:37.049
We live together.

1:26:37.081 --> 1:26:38.616
Of course you do.

1:26:38.649 --> 1:26:39.250
I didn't know.

1:26:39.283 --> 1:26:40.085
Yeah, no, I know.

1:26:40.117 --> 1:26:41.252
And that's, everybody.

1:26:41.286 --> 1:26:42.721
There's a lot of how-

1:26:42.754 --> 1:26:43.889
- You're unbelievable.

1:26:43.921 --> 1:26:44.790
Amy, come on.

1:26:44.822 --> 1:26:45.957
Amy.

1:26:45.991 --> 1:26:46.992
I'm sorry.

1:26:47.024 --> 1:26:47.826
Me, too.

1:26:47.858 --> 1:26:48.893
Logan.

1:26:48.926 --> 1:26:50.129
Go fuck yourself.

1:26:52.163 --> 1:26:53.933
Amy, I swear nothing happened.

1:26:53.965 --> 1:26:55.968
Condoms by her trashcan.

1:26:56.001 --> 1:26:57.002
Okay, that happened.

1:26:57.035 --> 1:26:58.671
Look, I was drunk, okay.

1:26:58.703 --> 1:27:00.072
And I thought it would
help the movie's chances.

1:27:00.104 --> 1:27:01.306
She's senior programmer.

1:27:01.340 --> 1:27:03.842
You must think I'm
a total fucking idiot.

1:27:03.875 --> 1:27:05.243
Nothing happened.

1:27:05.277 --> 1:27:07.011
She was with somebody else.

1:27:07.045 --> 1:27:08.113
Oh, so.

1:27:08.145 --> 1:27:10.148
Oh, she rejected you.

1:27:10.181 --> 1:27:13.318
And then you ripped up a box
of condoms in a fit of rage.

1:27:13.352 --> 1:27:14.252
- Look.
- Got it.

1:27:14.286 --> 1:27:15.854
Nothing actually happened.

1:27:15.886 --> 1:27:16.955
Yes, Logan.

1:27:16.987 --> 1:27:19.591
Something has been happening
for a really long time

1:27:19.625 --> 1:27:22.861
because you need validation
to measure your worth.

1:27:22.894 --> 1:27:24.363
You were already loved.

1:27:24.395 --> 1:27:26.197
And winning this fucking trophy

1:27:26.230 --> 1:27:27.332
from a festival you
didn't even wanna

1:27:27.366 --> 1:27:29.001
go to in the first place

1:27:29.033 --> 1:27:33.605
is the first time I've seen
you smile like that in.

1:27:33.639 --> 1:27:34.739
I don't know.

1:27:36.174 --> 1:27:37.910
Well, I like smiling.

1:27:38.910 --> 1:27:39.912
So I'm done.

1:27:41.112 --> 1:27:42.347
Okay, if we could just-

1:27:42.380 --> 1:27:44.249
- You leave me alone or
I'll fucking clock you.

1:27:54.660 --> 1:27:56.260
Well, so the good
news is this award-

1:27:56.294 --> 1:27:57.962
- I don't care.

1:27:57.996 --> 1:27:59.931
- What?
- Sell it to whoever you want.

1:27:59.965 --> 1:28:00.699
I don't care anymore.

1:28:00.732 --> 1:28:01.367
Logan.

1:28:25.090 --> 1:28:25.991
What are you doing?

1:28:26.024 --> 1:28:29.961
I'm about to jackal
off to this jerky.

1:28:29.995 --> 1:28:30.830
Cut.

1:28:38.103 --> 1:28:38.904
Hey, Logan.

1:28:38.937 --> 1:28:39.738
Hey.

1:28:39.770 --> 1:28:40.871
Real quick.

1:28:40.906 --> 1:28:44.076
So am I supposed to be
embarrassed that I got caught

1:28:44.108 --> 1:28:47.412
or am I just so excited
I don't even care?

1:28:48.813 --> 1:28:49.747
Let's look at the sides.

1:28:49.781 --> 1:28:50.850
Okay, yeah.

1:28:52.884 --> 1:28:55.154
Yeah see, there's an
exclamation point.

1:28:55.187 --> 1:28:58.858
So does that mean I'm
excited to jackal off?

1:29:00.224 --> 1:29:02.026
Honestly, I'd
just say it like,

1:29:02.059 --> 1:29:05.163
this is gonna happen
whether you watch me or not.

1:29:05.197 --> 1:29:06.265
- Right?
- Yeah.

1:29:07.364 --> 1:29:09.201
Sounds good.

1:29:09.233 --> 1:29:11.770
Can we make the door blue?

1:29:13.071 --> 1:29:14.473
Yeah.

1:29:14.505 --> 1:29:16.240
You got it.

1:29:18.343 --> 1:29:19.144
Hello.

1:29:19.176 --> 1:29:21.313
Hi, Amy.

1:29:21.345 --> 1:29:23.147
It's me.

1:29:23.180 --> 1:29:24.950
Can we talk?

1:29:37.162 --> 1:29:38.063
Hey.

1:29:38.096 --> 1:29:39.898
I just came down
to tell you in person

1:29:39.930 --> 1:29:42.134
that I'm filing a restraining
order against you.

1:29:42.166 --> 1:29:43.334
I know I've been
calling a lot.

1:29:43.367 --> 1:29:44.769
You've left me a voicemail

1:29:44.803 --> 1:29:47.840
every single day
for three months.

1:29:47.872 --> 1:29:48.473
That's not romantic.

1:29:48.506 --> 1:29:50.308
That's harassment.

1:29:50.341 --> 1:29:51.876
Wait, hang on.

1:29:56.982 --> 1:29:58.317
I love you, Amy.

1:29:59.283 --> 1:30:00.285
And when we were together,

1:30:00.318 --> 1:30:03.889
you were the only
real thing I had

1:30:03.921 --> 1:30:07.058
and at night at the
festival I just,

1:30:07.091 --> 1:30:10.929
I felt inadequate and I
wanted to be validated.

1:30:10.961 --> 1:30:14.299
And I am truly sorry
that I had hurt you

1:30:15.267 --> 1:30:17.403
in order to understand that.

1:30:18.502 --> 1:30:19.337
I just.

1:30:20.938 --> 1:30:24.209
I got so caught up in
wanting to win, you know,

1:30:24.242 --> 1:30:27.212
and wanting to be the guy.

1:30:28.112 --> 1:30:29.847
The hero of my own.

1:30:35.487 --> 1:30:39.291
It sucks because you
became the villain in mine.

1:30:56.373 --> 1:30:57.309
What's that?

1:30:57.341 --> 1:30:59.143
That is a royalty statement.

1:30:59.176 --> 1:31:02.046
People are finding are
movie all over the world.

1:31:02.080 --> 1:31:03.881
I made my money back.

1:31:03.915 --> 1:31:05.117
That's great.

1:31:05.149 --> 1:31:06.951
Yeah and making a
movie that breaks even

1:31:06.984 --> 1:31:09.287
is a huge success in this town.

1:31:09.321 --> 1:31:13.425
And I used that to convince
some real investors this time

1:31:13.457 --> 1:31:16.828
to invest in a second
feature with you directing.

1:31:16.862 --> 1:31:18.264
So what do you say?

1:31:20.431 --> 1:31:21.532
I don't know.

1:31:21.567 --> 1:31:22.901
Yeah, okay, great. Let's
get on the horn tomorrow.

1:31:22.934 --> 1:31:23.969
Alex, I said I don't know.

1:31:24.001 --> 1:31:26.004
Yeah, well I do know
because this is our dream.

1:31:26.037 --> 1:31:26.939
So what the fuck?

1:31:26.971 --> 1:31:27.605
I.

1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:32.211
I just gave so much of myself

1:31:32.243 --> 1:31:34.546
to the first one and for what?

1:31:38.215 --> 1:31:41.553
I don't think I can handle
failing like that again.

1:31:41.586 --> 1:31:42.421
Failing?

1:31:44.889 --> 1:31:46.325
What'd you expect?

1:31:46.358 --> 1:31:48.360
You swung for the
fences, you got on base.

1:31:48.393 --> 1:31:50.261
Most people don't even
get a chance at bat.

1:31:50.295 --> 1:31:52.297
Yeah, it's not failing.

1:31:52.330 --> 1:31:54.131
It's growing.

1:31:54.165 --> 1:31:56.401
Quitting is failing,
you fucking baby.

1:31:56.434 --> 1:31:58.203
You know, you used to
be my goddamn hero.

1:31:58.236 --> 1:32:00.372
Now you've proven all your
worst fears to be true.

1:32:00.404 --> 1:32:04.042
You are a hack and an
egomaniac and a fraud.

1:32:05.309 --> 1:32:06.544
What was that speech you gave

1:32:06.577 --> 1:32:08.446
about wanting to be
a part of something?

1:32:08.479 --> 1:32:13.050
You just had a producer offer
you a movie and you said no.

1:32:13.084 --> 1:32:14.353
Why?

1:32:14.385 --> 1:32:16.053
Because it's not
fucking Judd Apatow?

1:32:16.086 --> 1:32:17.455
Who gives a shit?

1:32:17.488 --> 1:32:18.924
Yeah, I love Judd Apatow.

1:32:18.956 --> 1:32:21.225
And I'd worked with
him in a heartbeat,

1:32:21.259 --> 1:32:25.464
but fuck trying to be somebody
else or in their club.

1:32:26.965 --> 1:32:29.334
Why don't you start
your own club?

1:32:29.367 --> 1:32:31.503
I'd love to be a
part of that club.

1:32:31.536 --> 1:32:33.372
Tom would love to be
part of that club, too,

1:32:33.404 --> 1:32:35.006
before he dies of old age.

1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:36.241
Hey.

1:32:36.273 --> 1:32:37.508
You have everything
you need right here

1:32:37.541 --> 1:32:39.210
and if you can't see that

1:32:39.243 --> 1:32:41.013
or you don't have
something you wanna say,

1:32:41.045 --> 1:32:44.415
or you just want to make money,
well then why don't you move

1:32:44.448 --> 1:32:47.585
anywhere the fuck
else and sell plastic?

1:32:49.354 --> 1:32:53.358
Or better yet, you still
got that award on you?

1:32:53.390 --> 1:32:54.393
Yeah.

1:32:58.429 --> 1:33:00.598
Why don't you sell these?

1:33:12.176 --> 1:33:13.377
Okay.

1:33:13.411 --> 1:33:14.246
Okay?

1:33:16.547 --> 1:33:17.983
Yeah.

1:33:18.015 --> 1:33:21.252
If all of you guys are
in, then let's do it.

1:33:23.688 --> 1:33:25.023
Okay.

1:33:25.055 --> 1:33:28.493
What if we make a
movie about a festival?

1:33:34.532 --> 1:33:35.467
Nah.

1:33:35.500 --> 1:33:36.434
- I don't think so.
- That would never work.

1:33:36.468 --> 1:33:38.202
No, 'cause showbiz
movies, they don't work.

1:33:38.236 --> 1:33:39.270
That's too inside baseball.

1:33:39.304 --> 1:33:41.406
I mean, unless you
literally had Ryan Gosling.

1:33:41.438 --> 1:33:42.239
No, no, no.

1:33:42.273 --> 1:33:43.174
About the film.

1:33:43.207 --> 1:33:44.442
- What we just did.
- Such a bad investment.

1:33:44.475 --> 1:33:45.743
It would be a bad idea.

1:33:55.220 --> 1:33:56.154
What was that?

1:33:56.187 --> 1:33:57.255
I don't know.

1:33:57.287 --> 1:33:59.090
I think I looked at the camera.

1:33:59.123 --> 1:33:59.992
What is my line?

1:34:00.024 --> 1:34:00.591
That's a good thing.

1:34:00.625 --> 1:34:01.660
That's a good thing.

1:34:01.693 --> 1:34:02.494
I was just-

1:34:02.527 --> 1:34:03.729
- What?

1:34:03.761 --> 1:34:05.130
Serving crab cakes
instead of yourself.

1:34:05.162 --> 1:34:05.997
No.

1:34:06.764 --> 1:34:08.968
Cinema!

1:34:11.469 --> 1:34:13.505
It's not just mayonnaise.

1:34:17.608 --> 1:34:19.010
A big chunk just
went down my throat.

1:34:19.044 --> 1:34:19.644
Okay.

1:34:19.676 --> 1:34:21.246
This is so ridiculous.

1:34:21.278 --> 1:34:22.179
Okay, one more.

1:34:22.212 --> 1:34:23.514
Prove your worth to this.

1:34:23.547 --> 1:34:25.416
Okay,
try it one more.

1:34:25.450 --> 1:34:26.651
Fuck, it was good, too.

1:34:26.684 --> 1:34:27.586
Yeah,
that was great.

1:34:27.618 --> 1:34:28.553
You got so excited.

1:34:28.586 --> 1:34:30.255
I did.

1:34:30.287 --> 1:34:33.424
We're reviewing all the
films for our blog fest and.

1:34:33.457 --> 1:34:34.625
We just started
so we don't know.

1:34:34.658 --> 1:34:36.060
Yeah, we don't know
what it's called.

1:34:36.094 --> 1:34:36.795
Allison Sharp
here with writer,

1:34:36.827 --> 1:34:39.730
producer, actor, editor, and.

1:34:39.764 --> 1:34:40.565
Bop, bop.

1:34:40.598 --> 1:34:41.800
Here I go.

1:34:41.832 --> 1:34:43.535
That was even better
on the brick screen.

1:34:43.568 --> 1:34:45.637
You from that Hollywood?

1:34:45.670 --> 1:34:47.605
You from that LA place?

1:34:47.639 --> 1:34:48.440
Sorry.

1:34:48.473 --> 1:34:49.274
My bad, dude.

1:34:49.306 --> 1:34:50.108
Are there any radio?

1:34:50.140 --> 1:34:51.576
Wedding videographers?

1:34:51.608 --> 1:34:52.544
I have a question.

1:34:52.577 --> 1:34:54.413
Were there any wedding?

1:34:54.446 --> 1:34:55.247
Fuck.

1:34:55.279 --> 1:34:56.081
I have a question.

1:34:56.113 --> 1:34:56.714
Oh, I have a question.

1:34:56.747 --> 1:34:57.782
Were there any widow?

1:34:57.815 --> 1:34:59.117
Fuck.

1:34:59.149 --> 1:35:01.353
Were there any
wedding videographers?

1:35:01.385 --> 1:35:03.421
Versus a point
and shoot concern.

1:35:03.455 --> 1:35:04.355
Fuck.

1:35:04.389 --> 1:35:06.491
In true 4K with master pry.

1:35:06.523 --> 1:35:07.526
Fuck, that's not it.

1:35:07.559 --> 1:35:08.794
Versus a point and
shoot consumer.

1:35:08.827 --> 1:35:10.629
Fucking fuck.

1:35:10.662 --> 1:35:14.499
Versus appointed shoot
consumer fuck phone.

1:35:14.532 --> 1:35:15.434
Fuck me.

1:35:15.466 --> 1:35:17.201
Very much like to know that.

1:35:17.234 --> 1:35:18.569
What the fuck is with?

1:35:18.603 --> 1:35:19.604
Fuck it.

1:35:19.636 --> 1:35:21.639
Plus the first
allows me to kill.

1:35:21.672 --> 1:35:25.210
Nope,
gotta go back.

1:35:25.242 --> 1:35:27.278
Goddammit, Dunbar.

1:35:27.312 --> 1:35:29.113
Not too long ago I was working

1:35:29.147 --> 1:35:33.117
on a medical supply commercial
with Corbin Bernsen and he.

1:35:34.586 --> 1:35:35.554
Quick story.

1:35:35.586 --> 1:35:36.754
Couple of summers ago,
I was standing in line

1:35:36.787 --> 1:35:40.491
at an El Pollo Loco behind
the dad from "Family Matters".

1:35:40.524 --> 1:35:41.559
And I.

1:35:42.693 --> 1:35:43.629
Not a lot of people know this,

1:35:43.662 --> 1:35:47.199
but Suzanne Pleshette
is my godmother and.

1:35:48.632 --> 1:35:51.368
Why would I ever even care
to even sit down and write that

1:35:51.402 --> 1:35:53.371
and then ask so many
people I care about

1:35:53.403 --> 1:35:55.739
to come give up their
days for a month

1:35:55.773 --> 1:35:57.342
in the middle of the
summer when the weather-

1:35:57.375 --> 1:35:58.643
