_ You think someone _
tipped him off we were coming?

00:32.110 --> 00:35.489
Did you warn Joe
Marty's team was on its way
to Katherine Hale's house?

00:35.600 --> 00:38.615
-You really knew

There is a very good
reason that such an impressive

01:57.920 --> 02:00.457
have such a dearth
of publicly-a va/lab/e work.

IEP Analytics wasn ’t really

02:03.480 --> 02:05.584
It was a CIA front.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.909

This ob vious/y isn ’t
what we imagine

02:13.410 --> 02:15.230
when we think of the CIA,

02:15.340 --> 02:17.991
computer scientists
in an office in Georgetown
writing algorithms.

02:18.100 --> 02:21.752
These were not
field-operat/ves,
these were analysts,

02:21.860 --> 02:24.727
hand-picked to come up
with out-of-the-boX solutions

02:24.830 --> 02:27.003

What might
Turner’s motives have been
to target such a place?

02:33.430 --> 02:36.490
Do we have to assume that
this is related to the attack
on ComQuest F/e/d?

02:36.600 --> 02:39.728
If Caleb Wolfe
or the authorities have
answers to those questions,

02:39.840 --> 02:41.057
they’re not lett/ng on.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.378
And how did Caleb Wolfe
come upon this information?

02:43.480 --> 02:45.345
What were his motives
for releas/ng It?

02:45.450 --> 02:47.145
[female expert]
Caleb Wolfe
/s an act/wst.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.502
He’s a resource
for wh/st/eb/owers.

02:49.610 --> 02:51.783
In this case,
we just don ’t know
who blew the wh/st/e.

02:51.890 --> 02:53.539
[man on TV]
Turner and Wolfe
knew each other

02:53.650 --> 02:55.515
wh/le they were both
grad students at MIT.

02:55.620 --> 02:58.430
[female expert]
The two
smartest students at MIT
knowing each other

02:58.540 --> 03:00.599
is hardly surpn'sing.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.874
This guy goes online, and he
starts spread/ng a bunch
of pro vocative allegations

03:03.980 --> 03:06.323
and it spreads through
the med/a l/ke wﬂdfire.

03:06.430 --> 03:10.002
But I would just rem/nd
our prudent American
consumers of information. . .

03:10.110 --> 03:13.329
-[Marty] I'm seeing it.
-[Reuel on phone]
I ’ve been
speaking to the director.

03:13.430 --> 03:16.536
Now he's convinced
that it can't be
a connCIdence

03:16.640 --> 03:19.370
that Joe Turner's old friend
Caleb Wolfe

03:19.480 --> 03:22.256
has come up with information
relevant to our case.

03:22.360 --> 03:27.184
Working theory around here
is that Turner joined
the agency as a Trojan horse.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.862
And if so, might call Wolfe
for safe harbor.

03:30.970 --> 03:33.541
And Wolfe’s network
could hide him Indefinite/y.

03:33.650 --> 03:36.198
[Marty on phone]
The FBI
has been hunting Caleb Wolfe
for three years.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.473
How do we use him
to find Turner?

03:38.580 --> 03:40.593
Janice Haron.

03:40.700 --> 03:44.796
Now she hasn't had any known
contact with Wolfe or Turner
since they left MIT, but, uh...

03:44.900 --> 03:46.288
[punching in code]

03:46.390 --> 03:49.041
As far as we know, she's clean.

03:49.150 --> 03:52.722
The Bureau thinks that
she's still connected to Wolfe
and,uh".

03:52.830 --> 03:54.889
If that's the case, then, uh,

03:54.990 --> 03:58.096
she's the logical intermediary
between Wolfe and Turner.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.896
Do you have someone
you can trust
to look into this?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.888
[Marty] I'll take care of it.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.219
How did Caleb Wolfe
come to be In possess/on
of such sensitive information

04:06.330 --> 04:08.264
on a top-secret CIA project?

04:08.370 --> 04:11.385
I th/nk the unexplored
poss/b/lity here, is that
this whole thing

04:11.490 --> 04:14.641
Is a left-wing conspiracy
aimed to discredihng the CIA.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.235
[sighs]

04:22.340 --> 04:24.956
Who doesn't keep
an old cell phone or laptop
lying around the house?

04:25.060 --> 04:30.965
Rick doesn't live here
full time, and Richard,
his dad, was 97 when he died.

04:31.070 --> 04:35.689
He used to say, "I was born
after the Great War, before we
knew enough to number them."

04:35.790 --> 04:39.499
[chuckles]
He was a total Luddite.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.716
Only had a TV
because he liked CSI.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.298
What if they didn't
stay in touch?

04:45.400 --> 04:47.743
I mean, you're assuming
that if you got in touch
with Janice,

04:47.850 --> 04:50.944
she could put you in touch
with Caleb, but maybe
they're out of contact.

04:51.050 --> 04:54.668
And, you know, even if
they weren't, why assume
that Caleb knows anything?

04:54.770 --> 04:56.874
Well, Caleb obviously
knows something.

04:56.980 --> 04:59.631
No one outside the CIA
was supposed to know
aboutIEP.

04:59.740 --> 05:03.073
Maybe if we get together
we can learn something.

05:03.180 --> 05:04.750
Okay, well,
we're wasting our time.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.067
We're not gonna find
a cell phone or computer
in this house.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.369
The police are gone.

05:12.470 --> 05:16.008
I mean, you couldn't risk
being seen outside, but...

05:16.110 --> 05:18.135
-No.
-You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.333
I'm not seeing anyone else
get hurt because of me.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.431
Well, I'm not asking
your permission.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.379
I'm no longer your hostage.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.584
Didn't the CIA train you?

05:27.690 --> 05:29.942
-Yeah, of course.
-We||, did they ever teach you

05:30.050 --> 05:32.223
what to do if you're caught
behind enemy lines,

05:32.330 --> 05:35.140
and you needed to trust
someone else
who could help you?

05:35.250 --> 05:37.718
Trust them, no,
manipulate them, yeah.

05:37.820 --> 05:40.357
Well, in this case,
you don't have to do that.

05:40.460 --> 05:45.159
Listen, have you considered
that you might have some form
of Stockholm syndrome?

05:45.260 --> 05:47.160
-[Kathy] Of course.
-And?

05:47.270 --> 05:49.124
I liked you
before you took me hostage.

05:49.230 --> 05:53.883
Yeah, Kathy, I like you too,
which is why I cannot
let you do this.

05:53.990 --> 05:57.016
Look, I don't know a lot about
this kind of stuff,

05:57.120 --> 05:58.769
but it would seem to me
that you're fighting an enemy

05:58.880 --> 06:00.609
who's got you
pretty out-matched.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.017
And the only way
you're gonna survive

06:02.120 --> 06:05.009
is if you use every weapon
at your disposal.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.122
[Kathy]
You can turn around now.

06:10.010 --> 06:12.001
This is a bad idea.

also search/ng for a Georgetown
resident Kather/ne Hale,

06:56.050 --> 06:57.995
who they figure may be
Turner’s latest victim.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.795
That's $33.95,

06:59.900 --> 07:01.891
and I'll need to see some ID.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.571
-ID?
-That's the law.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.468
-Why?
-Terrorists.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.449
Well, look,
I don't have a license.

07:13.550 --> 07:15.962
A passport or a library card
would do.

07:16.070 --> 07:18.459
Uh, I don't have
my wallet with me.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.257
-Then, I can't help you.
-Wait, no. I need it
to call my sister.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.954
-It doesn't matter
who you have to call.
-She's coming to get me.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.511
ID.

07:33.170 --> 07:36.298
The reason I don't have

07:36.410 --> 07:38.230
my license,

07:38.340 --> 07:41.412
or my credit cards
is because my husband
took them from me.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.091
Or maybe we should
call the police.

07:50.110 --> 07:52.123
He's a cop.

07:52.230 --> 07:54.221
Shit.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.661

08:47.240 --> 08:50.585
Yeah, I mentioned to
my daughter that I needed
a new one.

08:50.690 --> 08:53.500
She broke open her piggy bank
and bought it for me.

08:53.610 --> 08:55.601
What did you tell her
when she gave it to you?

08:56.170 --> 08:57.580
The truth.

08:57.690 --> 09:00.238
I told her it was
the most beautiful laptop case
I'd ever seen,

09:00.340 --> 09:02.638
and that I would
cherish it always.

09:02.740 --> 09:05.072

10:44.720 --> 10:46.494

Your friend from MIT
was on the news.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.409
[Janice]
He's been on the news all day.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.863
No, your other friend.
The one you didn't sleep with.

10:50.970 --> 10:51.902
Caleb?

10:52.010 --> 10:53.420
-Yeah.
-What's he gotta say?

10:53.530 --> 10:56.829
Uh, he said that
Joe Turner was in the CIA.

10:56.930 --> 11:00.263
-Really?
-Yeah, I DVR'd it for you.

11:00.370 --> 11:02.213
The government would
have you believe
they were just ciwl/ans

11:02.300 --> 11:04.712
caught in a shooting,
but that’s not the real story.

11:04.820 --> 11:07.232
They were American
service members,
and they were targeted.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.331
Can you believe that?

11:10.300 --> 11:12.404
I guess you can never
really tell who someone is.

11:12.510 --> 11:14.501
-Hmm.
-[cell phone vibrates]

11:16.870 --> 11:18.940

-[Joe on phone]
This a bad time?

11:22.160 --> 11:24.151
It's work.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.731
Why are you calling me?

11:26.840 --> 11:28.455
I need to see Caleb.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.334
Yeah, but why
are you call/ng me?

11:30.440 --> 11:33.898
Because you're the only
person who can get in touch
with him, Janice.

11:34.010 --> 11:35.784
I don't talk to Caleb anymore,

11:35.890 --> 11:37.983
and you're a fugitive
from the law.

11:38.090 --> 11:40.308
Just talking to you
on the phone
I can get disbarred.

11:40.410 --> 11:43.072
Janice, you know I didn't
kill anyone, okay?

11:43.180 --> 11:45.751
No, I don't know
shit about you!

11:45.860 --> 11:47.430
We used to know each other
a long t/me ago,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.872
but that was a long time ago.

11:49.980 --> 11:51.982
And then you jo/ned the CIA.

11:55.190 --> 11:56.441
How is she?

11:56.550 --> 11:58.006
Who?

11:58.110 --> 12:01.568
The woman
you're holding hostage.
Is she all right?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.671
Kathy? Yeah, she's fine.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.297
Turn yourself in.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.288
IfI do, they will kill me.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.459
Do it in a very public place.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.609
They, they shot
Lee Harvey Oswald
on TV, Janice.

12:14.210 --> 12:16.383
Well, then, I guess
you're out of options.

12:16.490 --> 12:18.503
Janice, I...

12:18.610 --> 12:20.749
I know some stuff.

12:20.850 --> 12:23.512
Stuff that Caleb
will wanna hear.

You can.

Bob Partridge is a senior
CIA officer

14:54.490 --> 14:56.481
and Joe Turner's mentor.

14:57.090 --> 14:58.626
And you think Partridge is--

14:58.730 --> 15:00.743
Well, I've been looking
into your files,

15:00.850 --> 15:04.069
and it doesn't seem like
you've ever done anything
like this before.

15:04.180 --> 15:05.909
And... Wait, do you think
that I'm...

15:06.020 --> 15:09.148
I wanna know how it is
that you got a55igned
to my team.

15:09.260 --> 15:11.251
I do not know Bob Partridge.

15:12.180 --> 15:14.683
I asked my superior
for reassignment.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.564
Why?

15:16.670 --> 15:19.389
Because I am capable of doing
more than what I was doing.

15:20.750 --> 15:24.299
I need to know
who I can trust in this office.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.391
You can trust me.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.751
Good.

15:36.530 --> 15:38.862
[Joe as a ch/ld]
My father
didn ’t believe in hunt/ng.

15:38.970 --> 15:40.983
No, he didn't
like hunting personally,

15:41.090 --> 15:43.081
but he believed in it.

15:44.090 --> 15:46.069
In its necessity.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.556
You mean culling?

15:47.660 --> 15:50.515
If you don't cull,
the quantity
of the population

15:50.620 --> 15:53.396
and the food supplies dwindle,

15:53.500 --> 15:55.809
then a lot more deer die.

15:55.910 --> 15:58.367
And they die
a lot more painfully.

15:58.470 --> 16:00.461
It's not entirely clear to me.

16:02.030 --> 16:03.679
Do you mean to tell me that

16:03.790 --> 16:07.135
you wouldn't push one person
_ under the tracks
if you knew that it would save

16:07.240 --> 16:10.095
five people at the station?

16:10.200 --> 16:11.019
No.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.690
What about if it was 10 people?

16:12.800 --> 16:15.746
-No.
-What about if it was
a bad person?

16:15.850 --> 16:17.784
You're talking about
human lives

16:17.890 --> 16:19.664
like they are trading cards.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.147
[Bob]
How many lives

16:22.250 --> 16:24.320
would it take
to make you wﬂ/ing

16:24.900 --> 16:26.913
to trade

16:27.020 --> 16:28.669
a single human life?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.350
There is no number.

16:30.460 --> 16:31.518
How can you say that?

16:31.620 --> 16:34.680
If you don't pick a number,
you can't lower it.

16:34.790 --> 16:36.781
[Bob chuckles]

16:43.150 --> 16:45.152
Do you see it?

16:46.680 --> 16:48.671
[Joe] Yeah.

16:58.490 --> 17:00.481
[gun cocks]

17:03.050 --> 17:05.041
[gunshot]

17:19.750 --> 17:22.503
How did you get to be
so self-assured, huh?

17:24.830 --> 17:26.832
You're a special kid.

17:32.360 --> 17:35.966
You could be a great service
to the world one day.

17:41.130 --> 17:43.121
How?

17:43.890 --> 17:45.892
That's not for me to decide.

18:22.890 --> 18:24.881
[unlocks door]

18:28.820 --> 18:30.811
[Bob exhales]

18:32.580 --> 18:34.571
Bob Partridge.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.581
What do I call you
just for conversation?

18:39.910 --> 18:41.901
Why are you in my car?

18:42.630 --> 18:45.929
We're both
watching Janice Haron,

18:46.030 --> 18:49.534
hoping she leads us
to Joe Turner.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.757
Marty thinks
you have an inside man
on our team.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.700
Are you supposed
to be telling me that?

18:57.810 --> 19:01.268
If I'm telling you something
you already know,
what does it matter?

19:01.370 --> 19:03.361
Marty, huh? You two close?

19:04.930 --> 19:06.932
Not as close as you used to be.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.795
[chuckles]
Did she tell you that?

19:15.900 --> 19:18.061
I heard it almost ended
your marriage.

19:19.590 --> 19:22.343
A spy's wife
catches him cheating.

19:24.710 --> 19:26.701
[keyboard clacking]

19:27.880 --> 19:29.859
-[knock on door]
-Come in.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.293
Ma'am, I've been trying
to gain access
to the IEP computers,

19:33.400 --> 19:35.209
but I can't get
a straight answer about
what happened to them.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.424
The IEP computers
were classified.

19:37.530 --> 19:39.521
Why? What did you think
you'd find on them?

19:41.450 --> 19:43.441
[sighs]

19:44.290 --> 19:48.590
I'm not sure I understand
why Joe Turner would've done
what we think he did.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.793
What's your theory?

19:50.900 --> 19:54.313
The people who worked here were
given the freedom and resources
to do whatever they wanted,

19:54.420 --> 19:57.526
to look at
any dark corner, and...

19:57.630 --> 20:00.360
Maybe one of them
found something they weren't
supposed to,

20:00.470 --> 20:03.121
and that's why
they were targeted?

20:03.230 --> 20:07.064
So, Joe Turner was the sole
innocent to make it out
of here alive?

20:08.120 --> 20:10.259
I know it's a stretch.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.170
No. It's smart.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.010
I mean, frankly, we don't know
what happened here, right?

20:16.120 --> 20:20.682
So, yes, it is best
not to get overly-attached
to any one narrative.

20:22.170 --> 20:23.865
Tell you what.

20:23.970 --> 20:27.428
I'll put in a request
to Langley, and try and get
access to those computers.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.033
-Thank you.
-Now, you should call it
a night and get some rest.

20:30.140 --> 20:32.131
Yes, ma'am.

20:33.460 --> 20:34.711
Take the alley.

20:34.820 --> 20:36.356
You don't wanna
run into that crowd.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.462
What crowd?

20:42.350 --> 20:44.944
[Marty] It's touching that
people have come out to mourn.

20:45.950 --> 20:48.896
Human life has no value,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.991
but the human dead,
they celebrate.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.351
This world is fucked.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.522
[exhales deeply]

21:15.340 --> 21:17.331
[indistinct chattering]

21:27.030 --> 21:29.032
Dr. and Mrs. Tan?

21:30.560 --> 21:33.051
I'm Sharla.
I knew your daughter.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.151
-[gasp51
-We had no idea.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.419
[Mrs. Tan]
She wasn't allowed to tell us.

21:38.530 --> 21:41.943
Had I known, I would have told
her how proud I was of her.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.507
She was a very good friend.

21:44.610 --> 21:47.124
One of the finest people
that I have ever known.

21:48.170 --> 21:50.172
And I truly loved her.

21:50.660 --> 21:52.651
[sobbing]

22:01.550 --> 22:03.723
[Kathy] If they were
willing to kill everyone
in your office,

22:03.830 --> 22:05.639
maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.741
What wasn't such a good idea?

22:08.270 --> 22:09.294
Getting you the phone.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.391
Oh, it was a terrible idea.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.111
And all I had
was bad options, so...

22:14.880 --> 22:16.871
What if she does call back?

22:18.560 --> 22:20.983
Well, I'll answer.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.342
Find out what Caleb knows,
tell him what I know.

22:23.450 --> 22:25.520
Try to figure out
what the fuck is going on.

22:26.130 --> 22:28.121
Then?

22:28.970 --> 22:30.551
Well, fight.

22:30.660 --> 22:32.651
-Fight?
-Yeah.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.516
The CIA?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.952
Well, it's, it's probably
not the whole CIA, Kathy,
but, you know...

22:37.060 --> 22:40.564
Yeah... Yeah, just a few
should't_ have too much trouble
givmg you a problem.

22:40.670 --> 22:42.604
You know what?
A couple of them have been
trying to kill me

22:42.710 --> 22:44.405
for the last two days
and yet, here I am.

22:44.510 --> 22:46.501
Even you have to be surprised
you're alive.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.351
You know,
when I joined the CIA,

22:56.680 --> 22:58.671
I thought I could change things

22:59.650 --> 23:01.641
from the inside.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.940
But I was wrong.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.029
You chose what you thought
was the harder path.

23:07.130 --> 23:09.064
Nobility is in the intention.

23:09.170 --> 23:13.550
There's nothing noble about
turning my back on a problem
I may have helped create.

23:13.660 --> 23:17.073
What happened
wasn't your fault.

23:17.180 --> 23:19.944
I mean, one of the other people
in your office could have found
those 12 companies, then what?

23:22.510 --> 23:25.286
You have survivor's guilt, Joe.
Your sin is you're alive.

23:25.390 --> 23:27.961
Come on, Kathy.
Is that your Psych 101 pitch?

23:28.070 --> 23:29.560
Why do something
that's gonna get you killed?

23:29.670 --> 23:32.878
Because if I don't, a whole
lot of people are going to die.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.951
[speaking in Arabic]

23:40.570 --> 23:42.879
[overlapping chatter]

23:53.580 --> 23:55.571
[beeps]

24:00.790 --> 24:02.781
[watcher] Look who's here.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.871
[sighs]

24:37.020 --> 24:39.011
[watcher] Target's in position.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.551
[speaking in Arabic]

25:20.060 --> 25:22.085
Green light.

25:22.190 --> 25:24.181
[dramatic music playing]

25:24.790 --> 25:25.927
[clicks]

25:26.030 --> 25:28.021
[air hissing]

25:45.010 --> 25:47.001
[watcher] Hallway is clear.

25:50.890 --> 25:52.892
[door beeps open]

25:54.260 --> 25:56.251
[door closes]

26:05.910 --> 26:07.901
[clicks]

26:11.750 --> 26:13.752
[clicks]

26:17.080 --> 26:19.071
Hallway is clear.

26:33.980 --> 26:35.971
[Bob] Can I ask you a question?

26:37.260 --> 26:39.694
Why are you pursuing

26:41.060 --> 26:43.164
Joe Turner?

26:43.270 --> 26:45.261
You don't really believe

26:47.110 --> 26:50.409
he just up and killed everyone
in his office, do you?

26:50.510 --> 26:54.014
At the very least,
he was working
with the people who did.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.270
Why would a person like that

26:57.080 --> 26:58.377
just snap?

26:58.480 --> 27:00.471
I don't know.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.962
But it happens.

27:04.130 --> 27:06.121
Maybe it's all of this.

27:07.290 --> 27:12.239
For two million years,
we spent most of our time
just keeping ourselves alive...

27:14.260 --> 27:17.479
Killing the food we needed
to keep us from starving,

27:17.580 --> 27:20.196
building shelter
so we wouldn't freeze,

27:20.300 --> 27:23.428
fighting our enemies
to protect what was ours.

27:26.030 --> 27:29.841
Now we spend our days
doing jobs we don't care about,

27:29.950 --> 27:34.694
so we can spend our nights
in front of a television that
tells us to go online

27:34.800 --> 27:36.415
and buy things,

27:36.520 --> 27:38.511
things we don't need,

27:38.920 --> 27:40.990
using money we never see

27:41.640 --> 27:43.642
or touch,

27:44.610 --> 27:46.601
yet it enslaves us.

27:47.610 --> 27:50.443
We've left the real world
for an imaginary one,

27:52.770 --> 27:54.772
and it's made us crazy.

27:56.340 --> 27:59.912
_Didn't it also make us
into a CIVIlized soaety?

28:00.020 --> 28:02.079
No.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.182
It's made us America.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.252
[line ringing]

28:23.360 --> 28:25.362
-[cell phone ringing]
-[Joe] Oh, shit!

28:25.690 --> 28:27.681
Hello?

28:33.250 --> 28:35.309
II D", "X",

28:35.420 --> 28:37.411
"Y", "5 15" I

28:39.580 --> 28:41.571
Thank you.

28:42.580 --> 28:43.558
Wait, what's that mean?

28:43.660 --> 28:45.605
It's a cipher.

28:45.710 --> 28:47.280
[Joe]
We used
to use it in school.

28:47.390 --> 28:48.721
It’s an address.

28:48.830 --> 28:50.764
Janice is sett/ng up
a meeting for me and Caleb.

28:50.870 --> 28:52.679
You don't have to do this, Joe.

28:52.790 --> 28:55.338
I work for one of the top
law firms in the country.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.931
We have a lot of
political clout.

28:58.040 --> 29:01.191
We represent congressmen,
_ three of the five
liVing ex-preSIdents.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.290
I could bring you in.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.903
We'd be with you
every step of the way.
I guarantee it.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.001
Why do you give a shit?

29:08.650 --> 29:10.299
I mean, you hardly know me,

29:10.410 --> 29:12.401
and for half the time
you have known me,
you thought I was crazy.

29:13.810 --> 29:15.812
Why do you care?

29:16.220 --> 29:18.313
Going to that store today
was the first time

29:18.420 --> 29:20.957
that I didn't choose
the safest option.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.051
Because that's what
I have always done,

29:24.100 --> 29:26.000
made my decisions
based on fear.

29:26.110 --> 29:30.160
You were the first
unplanned thing that's
happened in my adult life.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.329
And I have no idea
what's gonna happen next.

29:32.430 --> 29:34.204
Kathy.

29:34.310 --> 29:37.814
But if you walk out that door,
I know you're gonna die.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.297
There is nothing noble
about being killed.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.335
You know, I'm fucking sick
of seeing the truth twisted.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.261
IfI can do something
about it, I'm gonna
do something about it.

29:46.370 --> 29:47.860
You don't even know
what the truth is.

29:47.970 --> 29:50.382
No, but what I do know
is that those people
didn't blink an eye

29:50.490 --> 29:53.004
at killing my friends
to protect
whatever the truth is.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.548
[Bob] You know,
she may not even go anywhere.

29:56.660 --> 29:59.072
What if she does go somewhere
and leads us to your boy?

29:59.180 --> 30:01.171
Then we'll bring him in.

30:02.660 --> 30:05.026
Enough of my kids have died
already this week.

30:14.510 --> 30:17.809
[sighs] Now, when I leave,
you give it two hours.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.729
-Then what?
-Then you run out
the front door,

30:19.840 --> 30:22.172
you scream your fucking head
off, you go to a neighbor's
and you call the cops.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.372
-Okay.
-Okay?

30:23.480 --> 30:24.902
Now, the feds are gonna
interview you.

30:25.010 --> 30:26.625
You were bound and gagged.

30:26.730 --> 30:28.584
We never spoke.
I never said a word to you.

30:28.690 --> 30:30.419
That way they can't
trip you up on your story.

30:30.530 --> 30:33.021
-Why?
-Because, Kathy, you're not
gonna know who you can trust.

30:33.130 --> 30:36.475
The only person you can trust
is Bob Partridge.

30:36.580 --> 30:38.389
-How will I ﬁnd him?
-He'|| find you.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.353
Maybe right away.

30:39.460 --> 30:40.916
You do everything he says.

30:41.020 --> 30:42.032
-Got it?
-Got it.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.676
Okay.

30:43.780 --> 30:45.782
That's it.

30:47.870 --> 30:49.861
Kathy, there's one more thing
you need to know.

30:51.430 --> 30:54.240
There is a woman,
and she picked me up

30:54.350 --> 30:56.568
the night after we met
at a bar.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.410
She told me that
some fucking guy
was harassing her.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.375
We went back to my place,
and the next day,

31:02.480 --> 31:04.016
she tried to kill me.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.259
And I'm pretty sure
she killed everyone
in my office.

31:06.370 --> 31:08.622
-You slept with the woman
that shot you?
-Kathy, please listen.

31:08.730 --> 31:11.142
She has long black hair, okay?

31:11.250 --> 31:13.423
Dark brown eyes,
she sounds Middle-Eastern,

31:13.530 --> 31:16.033
uh, Arabic, maybe Israeli.

31:16.140 --> 31:18.950
If you come across her,
you fucking run.

31:19.060 --> 31:20.277
Okay?

31:20.380 --> 31:22.371
-Okay.
-All right.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.331
Why do you have to be the one
to fight people like that?

31:27.910 --> 31:31.641
Listen, you rub this against
something sharp.
You make it look legit.

31:31.750 --> 31:33.741
Are you really that smart?

31:35.550 --> 31:37.552
Obviously not.

31:59.620 --> 32:01.611
[Joe breathing heavily]

32:13.150 --> 32:15.368
[female newscaster]
In the Middle East;
two m/l/ion Muslims

32:15.470 --> 32:19.531
all over the world
are con verg/ng on Saudi Arabia
this week for the Hajj.

32:19.640 --> 32:23.292
Babe, I gotta go.
I have some work
I need to deal with.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.856
Well, it's 9:00 at night.

32:24.960 --> 32:29.624
Yeah, it's, uh...
I may not come home at all.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.539
That's fucking ominous.
Is everything okay?

32:31.650 --> 32:33.789
You're stoned.

32:33.890 --> 32:35.949
Ijust mean I might
crash on the office couch.

32:36.050 --> 32:39.349
You need to take care of
yourself, honey, so you can
take care of everyone else.

32:39.460 --> 32:40.711
Thank you, babe.

32:40.820 --> 32:42.811
-Love you.
-Love you.

32:48.510 --> 32:50.501
[suspenseful music playing]

33:10.490 --> 33:12.481
[car engine starts]

33:22.140 --> 33:25.758
[man] ...courage to change
the things I can

33:25.860 --> 33:28.363
[all] and wisdom to know
the difference.

33:28.470 --> 33:31.689
Welcome, everyone,
my name's Frank,
and I'm an alcoholic.

33:31.790 --> 33:34.167
-[a|l] Hi, Frank.
-Bef_ore I introduce
tonight's speaker,

33:34.270 --> 33:36.727
I wanna thank Marissa
for setting up the chairs,

33:36.830 --> 33:40.652
Aiden for bringing the cookies,
and John for the refreshments.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.751
-[a|l] Thanks, John.
-[Frank] Welcome.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.431
[indistinct chattering]

35:18.570 --> 35:20.618
If he does show up,
how do you wanna play this?

35:23.860 --> 35:26.374
I'll walk over and I'll ask him
to get in the car.

35:27.220 --> 35:29.222
What if he runs?

35:30.230 --> 35:32.221
He won't run.

35:33.190 --> 35:35.181
Not from me.

36:04.180 --> 36:06.171
[chuckles]

36:07.220 --> 36:09.211
[siren wailing]

36:27.680 --> 36:29.682
[suspenseful music playing]

36:43.900 --> 36:45.891
I can get
myself home from here.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.491
Nice meeting you, Bob.

36:51.310 --> 36:52.880
Yeah.

36:52.990 --> 36:55.663
_ It was nice _
meeting you too, Gabrielle.

36:57.350 --> 36:59.341
I know who you are.

36:59.670 --> 37:02.377
Israeli Special Forces.

37:02.480 --> 37:07.133
Kinetic scores off the charts,
especially for a person
with your small stature.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.515
Only problem was
you were psychologically

37:11.690 --> 37:13.624
unstable...

37:13.730 --> 37:16.540
Borderline personality
disorder,

37:16.650 --> 37:18.641
a morbid fascination
with death,

37:19.370 --> 37:20.837
a possible nymphomaniac.

37:20.940 --> 37:24.159
I had never seen that
on a file before today.

37:24.260 --> 37:27.297
And really, you cannot
make that shit up. So...

37:29.300 --> 37:31.768
Special Forces discharged you.

37:31.870 --> 37:33.940
Mossad wouldn't have anything
to do with you, but we...

37:35.110 --> 37:36.884
We took you on.

37:36.990 --> 37:39.481
An Arab Israeli who joins

37:39.590 --> 37:41.717
an occupying forces army,

37:42.680 --> 37:44.819
what does that say about her?

37:44.920 --> 37:46.899
You have an excellent record.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.991
But four years ago...

37:50.000 --> 37:51.501
[sighs]

37:51.610 --> 37:55.649
Your relationship
with the agency appears
to just end, and I

37:57.010 --> 38:00.832
can't find a trace of you
anywhere since.

38:00.940 --> 38:03.158
So my question is,

38:03.260 --> 38:06.798
what the hell have you
been doing for the last
four years

38:06.900 --> 38:10.961
that is so fucking sensitive
I can't know about it?

38:11.070 --> 38:13.743
If you're not working for us,
who are you working for?

38:14.790 --> 38:16.781
Who sent you here?

38:23.920 --> 38:25.911
That's three questions.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.758
If someone kills my kids,
I'm gonna come after them.

38:41.660 --> 38:43.651
[knocking on door]

38:51.060 --> 38:53.062
[knocking continues]

39:01.030 --> 39:03.157
[knocking on door]

39:14.210 --> 39:16.201
[speaking in Arabic]

39:32.310 --> 39:34.801
[Nathan ]
The prelim/nary stages
are complete.

39:34.910 --> 39:37.606
Abu-Saeed has been infected.

39:37.710 --> 39:42.192
The delivery man is en route
to meet with his friends _
from the mosque for their trip.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.048
We're working on that.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.775
The other asset

39:48.880 --> 39:52.122
is embedded
with a special task force unit
hunting Turner.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.081
Yes, sir.

40:04.060 --> 40:06.039
[door opens in distance]

40:06.140 --> 40:08.131
[suspenseful music playing]

40:19.110 --> 40:21.101
[indistinct chattering]

40:34.370 --> 40:36.986
[Frank] Okay,
thanks for sharing, Billy.

40:37.090 --> 40:39.627
Okay, that's all the time
we have.

40:39.730 --> 40:43.473
Before we close, does anyone
have a burning desire?

40:43.580 --> 40:46.492
I mean, anyone feel like
they're gonna use?

40:48.180 --> 40:50.171
Anyone?

40:50.700 --> 40:52.691
[sighs]

41:20.130 --> 41:22.121
Hey.

41:22.890 --> 41:24.892
Sharla, right?

41:25.380 --> 41:26.916
Figured you'd found
some other bar.

41:27.020 --> 41:28.794
I've been sober for two years.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.993
Well, you're in luck,

41:31.100 --> 41:33.091
we just got ourselves
a new coffee machine.

41:33.910 --> 41:35.366
Shot of 1942.

41:35.470 --> 41:37.461
It's good coffee.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.631
On me.

41:57.770 --> 41:59.101
Another.

41:59.210 --> 42:02.327
[door opens and closes]

42:10.140 --> 42:11.471
Caleb sent me.

42:11.580 --> 42:13.116
And where is Caleb?

42:13.220 --> 42:14.687
Not here.

42:14.790 --> 42:16.599
-Is he coming?
-No.

42:16.710 --> 42:17.881
Then who the fuck are you?

42:17.990 --> 42:20.049
I'm the guy who can take you
to see Caleb.

42:20.150 --> 42:22.141
[rhythmic music playing]

42:31.040 --> 42:33.531
You look familiar to me.
Where do I know you from?

42:33.640 --> 42:35.642
-I'm Bradley Cooper.
-[chuckles]

42:36.290 --> 42:37.541
I'm Allen.

42:37.650 --> 42:39.948
-[Sharla] Allen?
-Yeah.

42:40.050 --> 42:41.699
Can I get
one of your cigarettes?

42:41.810 --> 42:43.346
First, I gotta search you.

42:43.450 --> 42:46.499
You know what?
I think I can
save you the time.

42:58.230 --> 42:59.720
Can I get another?

42:59.830 --> 43:01.821
Please? Thank you.
Do you like Tequila?

43:02.430 --> 43:04.432
Can I buy you that shot?

43:05.520 --> 43:07.511
A romantic.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.631
I still gotta search you, man.

43:12.560 --> 43:14.824
I gotta get you
to strip down first.

43:14.930 --> 43:16.943
-Are you fucking serious?
-It's just business, man.

43:17.050 --> 43:19.189
I'm not looking
for a relationship
or anything here.

43:19.290 --> 43:21.281
[upbeat music playing]

43:22.290 --> 43:24.281
Oh, baby, you smell so fine.

43:28.420 --> 43:30.593
How do I know
you even know Caleb?

43:30.700 --> 43:32.691
He said he used
to call you Rico.

43:36.590 --> 43:38.581
[moaning]

43:58.250 --> 44:00.844
Oh, baby!
[muttering indistinctly]

44:06.380 --> 44:08.371
What's wrong? What's wrong?
What's wrong?

44:08.740 --> 44:10.799
What, seriously?

44:10.900 --> 44:12.197
[Derek] Here.

44:12.300 --> 44:13.471
The fuck are those?

44:13.580 --> 44:15.582
You'll be up in an hour,
no headache.

44:16.350 --> 44:19.080
-No.
-This isn't a negotiation, man.

44:19.190 --> 44:20.600
No, come on, baby, come on.

44:20.710 --> 44:22.701
I said no.

44:25.270 --> 44:26.851
I made a mistake.

44:26.960 --> 44:29.849
Caleb has as much of a reason
to wanna see me as I do
to see him.

44:29.960 --> 44:31.951
-These are my orders, man.
-Yeah?

44:32.400 --> 44:34.049
Fuck your orders.

44:34.160 --> 44:35.980
Fucking cock-tease.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.866
Yeah, and you're a limp-dick
piece of shit who can only get
pussy off a drunk woman.

44:38.970 --> 44:40.267
Fuck you.

44:40.370 --> 44:42.383
Touch me again
and I will put you
in the fucking hospital.

44:42.490 --> 44:45.914
Okay, okay. You don't have
to take this shit
if you don't want to.

44:46.020 --> 44:49.956
But you're gonna wear
a hood once you're inside
the van, okay?

44:50.060 --> 44:52.528
-Sure, whatever.
-All right. Right this way.

44:55.660 --> 44:57.662

Hello!

45:47.480 --> 45:48.697
Caleb!

Let me the fuck out!
