WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.644
Incoming,
peds in respiratory distress.

00:03.680 --> 00:05.746
30 seconds out. We got this.

00:06.783 --> 00:09.050
Hey, love.

00:09.085 --> 00:10.184
What are you doing here?

00:10.219 --> 00:12.164
Aren't you supposed to be home
taking care of yourself?

00:12.188 --> 00:13.721
I don't wanna stay at home.

00:13.756 --> 00:15.890
Just can't stop thinking
about things.

00:15.925 --> 00:18.059
I'd rather be here, busy.

00:18.094 --> 00:19.226
You sure?

00:21.264 --> 00:22.663
Since we lost the baby,

00:22.699 --> 00:24.999
Things with me and tate
are just different.

00:25.034 --> 00:26.767
I need to work.

00:26.803 --> 00:28.903
All right, well, you tell me
if you need anything.

00:28.938 --> 00:31.572
Okay? You got this?

00:31.608 --> 00:33.140
You're going to treatment 2.

00:33.176 --> 00:34.742
Emergency landing at o'hare.

00:34.777 --> 00:36.777
7-year-old girl
collapsed mid-flight.

00:36.813 --> 00:39.180
Acute shortness of breath
started on the plane.

00:39.215 --> 00:42.016
One albuterol and one racemic
epi given en route.

00:42.051 --> 00:43.985
Sats? Low 90s.

00:44.020 --> 00:46.087
Meds didn't do much.

00:46.122 --> 00:48.756
All right, gently.

00:48.791 --> 00:50.124
One, two, three.

00:50.159 --> 00:51.759
Mommy?

00:54.397 --> 00:56.197
She's just telling
her daughter to be calm.

00:56.232 --> 00:57.865
We speak english.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.667
Lungs sound congested...
Rhonchi throughout.

00:59.702 --> 01:01.769
Let's get a chest x-ray.
I'm dr. Choi.

01:01.804 --> 01:03.315
I'm gonna be taking care
of your daughter.

01:03.339 --> 01:05.105
Where are you traveling from?
Ecuador.

01:05.141 --> 01:07.119
All right, has your daughter
ingested any drugs? Alcohol?

01:07.143 --> 01:08.809
Anything we should be aware of?
No.

01:08.845 --> 01:10.122
Any medical issues
we should be aware of?

01:10.146 --> 01:11.812
She can never get enough air.

01:11.848 --> 01:13.280
Her lips are always blue.

01:13.316 --> 01:15.282
Her whole life,
the doctor in my village...

01:15.318 --> 01:16.384
She says she can't help.

01:16.419 --> 01:18.986
We were going to minneapolis
to see a heart doctor.

01:19.022 --> 01:19.854
Definitely volume overloaded.

01:19.889 --> 01:21.956
Let's get five milligrams
of lasix iv.

01:21.991 --> 01:24.825
Bp, 108 over 82.

01:24.861 --> 01:26.994
Heart rate, 110.
Could be a pulmonary issue,

01:27.030 --> 01:28.829
Or any number
of congenital heart defects.

01:28.865 --> 01:30.898
Let's get an ekg, and call ct.

01:30.933 --> 01:32.845
We're gonna do everything we can
for your daughter.

01:32.869 --> 01:34.001
Thank you.

01:36.105 --> 01:39.006
Incoming. Dr. Manning? Yep.

01:39.042 --> 01:41.208
Teresa azen, 25.

01:41.244 --> 01:42.977
Persistent vegetative state.

01:43.012 --> 01:44.979
Brought in by
her long-term care facility.

01:45.014 --> 01:46.847
After blood was discovered
in her urine.

01:46.883 --> 01:50.384
Now let's get vitals, a temp,
cbc, cmp, ua with c&s.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.019
Could just be a uti,

01:52.055 --> 01:53.866
But let's look at her kidneys
with an ultrasound.

01:53.890 --> 01:55.990
To rule out hydro from a stone.
Got it.

01:56.025 --> 01:58.859
All right, on my count,
one, two, three.

02:01.097 --> 02:02.830
Brain injury? Car crash.

02:05.735 --> 02:06.600
Teresa, I'm dr. Manning.

02:06.636 --> 02:09.904
I'm gonna take
good care of you, okay?

02:11.374 --> 02:13.174
G-tube looks good.

02:15.411 --> 02:17.044
Temp, 100.6.

02:19.882 --> 02:21.916
Unresponsive.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.762 --> 02:34.762
No kidney stones.
Let's look at the bladder.

02:39.769 --> 02:41.880
How long did you say she was in
a vegetative state for?

02:41.904 --> 02:42.970
Five years.

02:45.908 --> 02:48.876
We need to call the police.
This woman is pregnant.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.466
There's vaginal trauma,

03:03.567 --> 03:05.901
Which explains the blood
in the urine.

03:05.937 --> 03:08.671
Thank you.

03:08.706 --> 03:11.907
Is this our victim? Yeah.

03:11.943 --> 03:14.477
It's awful.
You ever see anything like this?

03:14.512 --> 03:16.545
I wish I could say I hadn't.
Okay, let's lift.

03:16.581 --> 03:19.649
One, two, three.

03:19.684 --> 03:22.551
So helpless.

03:22.587 --> 03:23.931
We're looking into
all of the employees.

03:23.955 --> 03:24.887
At teresa's facility.

03:24.922 --> 03:27.757
We're checking visitor logs,
security footage.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.425
We'll find out
who had access to her.

03:29.460 --> 03:30.460
And to her floor.

03:30.495 --> 03:32.495
But the rape kit's
only supposed to reveal dna.

03:32.530 --> 03:34.063
For the past five days.

03:34.098 --> 03:36.699
How is this gonna help?
I hate to say this,

03:36.734 --> 03:39.201
But the likelihood
in a case like this.

03:39.237 --> 03:41.904
Is that the offender's
been assaulting her regularly,

03:41.939 --> 03:43.973
Maybe even daily.

03:45.209 --> 03:48.911
Hey, teresa's parents are here.

03:48.946 --> 03:51.847
Okay.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.586
David and angela azen,

03:57.622 --> 04:00.923
This is detective lindsay
and dr. Manning.

04:00.958 --> 04:04.093
I am so sorry for
what happened to your daughter.

04:04.128 --> 04:06.529
How could someone
do this to her?

04:06.564 --> 04:08.698
Are you gonna
catch this monster?

04:08.733 --> 04:11.233
Yes, we've already opened
an investigation,

04:11.269 --> 04:15.571
And finding whoever did this
is a top priority for us.

04:15.606 --> 04:16.772
I just want you to know,

04:16.808 --> 04:21.110
We are gonna give your daughter
the best possible care.

04:21.144 --> 04:24.513
Why don't you go spend
some time with your daughter?

04:34.992 --> 04:37.059
We have 18 patients
on this floor,

04:37.095 --> 04:40.763
All suffering from
serious mental illnesses.

04:40.798 --> 04:43.632
Since age 13,
henry has been battling.

04:43.668 --> 04:47.670
Anorexia nervosa coupled with
borderline personality disorder.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.972
Evelyn struggles
with schizophrenia,

04:50.007 --> 04:53.008
Auditory hallucinations,
paranoia.

04:53.044 --> 04:54.844
We have her on
a new anti-psychotic,

04:54.879 --> 04:57.646
Hoping that'll curb
her violent tendencies.

04:59.517 --> 05:00.349
Patients might be here.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.818
Anywhere from six weeks
to six months.

05:02.854 --> 05:04.854
You're not listening!

05:04.889 --> 05:07.590
You don't belong here. Get out!

05:07.625 --> 05:09.992
Get out! That's enough, tom.

05:10.027 --> 05:12.762
Why don't we go work
on your art project?

05:16.167 --> 05:18.033
Who are you?

05:18.069 --> 05:21.804
I'm dr. Reese.
I'm visiting from chicago med.

05:21.839 --> 05:23.506
He's right.

05:23.541 --> 05:25.674
I don't belong here.

05:25.710 --> 05:29.845
All the doctors think I'm crazy,
but I'm not.

05:29.881 --> 05:33.215
Dr. Reese, we're moving on.

05:33.251 --> 05:34.917
She's the worst.

05:39.090 --> 05:41.023
Hey, just so you know,

05:41.058 --> 05:43.926
"crazy" is a word I never use.

05:47.231 --> 05:49.832
And we've got ms. Perreira...
Post op day two.

05:49.867 --> 05:52.701
We removed her chest tube
and wires this morning.

05:52.737 --> 05:55.638
She is tolerating a diet,
and looking good.

05:55.673 --> 05:57.072
She's on a solid dose
of morphine.

05:57.108 --> 05:59.074
And what about consults?

05:59.110 --> 06:01.877
We have two in the micu,
one for an aortic valve,

06:01.913 --> 06:03.546
And the other for
a potential bypass.

06:03.581 --> 06:05.225
All right.
Let's go have a look, everybody.

06:05.249 --> 06:07.049
Just a moment. One more thing...

06:07.084 --> 06:10.586
More of a question, really.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.622
What does a jewish pirate say?

06:16.127 --> 06:18.093
I beg your pardon, dr. Latham?

06:18.129 --> 06:21.897
What does a jewish pirate say?

06:23.768 --> 06:25.334
Ahoy vey.

06:27.238 --> 06:30.840
Get it? Ahoy vey.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.710
All right, that's a...

06:34.745 --> 06:36.278
That is a good one, dr. Latham.

06:36.314 --> 06:39.682
Jewish humor. Long tradition.

06:39.717 --> 06:41.851
Shall we move on to the micu?

06:45.289 --> 06:47.857
So I take it that your tms
treatments are going well.

06:47.892 --> 06:51.260
Yes, I've been picking up on
all sorts of subtleties.

06:51.295 --> 06:52.928
In the way people communicate.

06:52.964 --> 06:54.864
For instance,
it never dawned on me.

06:54.899 --> 06:57.099
The profound purpose behind
sharing a joke.

06:57.134 --> 07:01.036
Well, what is it?

07:01.072 --> 07:03.138
Camaraderie, dr. Rhodes.

07:03.174 --> 07:04.306
Camaraderie.

07:06.811 --> 07:09.245
Hey, check out what I got you.

07:11.749 --> 07:14.750
Mousse de maracuj¡.

07:14.785 --> 07:16.252
Your favorite.

07:16.287 --> 07:17.820
When I was, like, eight.

07:17.855 --> 07:21.690
Well, still, I thought
it might make you feel better.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.201
He's trying, april.

07:34.038 --> 07:35.971
No one knows what to say.

07:37.475 --> 07:39.775
There's nothing to say.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.948
How were rounds
at the youth hospital?

07:45.983 --> 07:46.882
Brutal.

07:46.918 --> 07:48.751
I'm sure there's
a more clinical term, but...

07:48.786 --> 07:49.786
I hear ya.

07:49.820 --> 07:52.187
It's really hard
to see so many teenagers.

07:52.223 --> 07:53.055
Suffering from
psychological trauma.

07:53.090 --> 07:55.457
Yeah, younger patients
are the hardest.

07:55.493 --> 07:58.928
Very tough to draw a line
between an actual disorder.

07:58.963 --> 08:00.829
And good old-fashioned
adolescence.

08:00.865 --> 08:02.798
How do you learn
to make that call?

08:02.833 --> 08:05.200
Tourist asks a new yorker,

08:05.236 --> 08:08.337
"how do you get to
carnegie hall?"

08:08.372 --> 08:09.772
Practice.

08:13.210 --> 08:14.843
Hi.

08:14.879 --> 08:17.179
So teresa is approximately
ten weeks along.

08:17.214 --> 08:20.115
In her pregnancy. God.

08:20.151 --> 08:24.186
Fortunately, termination
will be a painless procedure.

08:24.221 --> 08:25.988
Wait, termination?

08:27.391 --> 08:29.291
We don't want that.

08:29.327 --> 08:31.026
We wanna keep the baby.

08:31.062 --> 08:32.361
I'm sorry.

08:32.395 --> 08:35.164
I thought,
given the circumstances...

08:35.198 --> 08:36.865
Mr. And mrs. Azen,

08:36.900 --> 08:39.368
Nothing has to be decided today.

08:39.403 --> 08:41.703
No, we've made up our mind.

08:41.739 --> 08:44.039
It is terrible what happened
to our daughter,

08:44.075 --> 08:46.508
But even if it came from a rape,

08:46.544 --> 08:48.877
The baby's still part of teresa.

08:48.913 --> 08:51.180
The only part we have left.

08:51.215 --> 08:53.882
Yes, and I can understand that,

08:53.918 --> 08:55.751
But in your daughter's
condition,

08:55.786 --> 08:56.952
I have to tell you,

08:56.988 --> 09:02.024
Taking this pregnancy to term
would be extremely difficult.

09:02.059 --> 09:03.425
Why? Her brain has been injured,

09:03.461 --> 09:05.995
But her body's healthy. No.

09:06.030 --> 09:09.231
At five years in a persistent
vegetative state, it's not.

09:09.266 --> 09:12.034
This is a high risk situation
for pulmonary embolism,

09:12.069 --> 09:14.937
Sepsis, colonic obstruction,
respiratory failure.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.739
But those are just risks, right?

09:16.774 --> 09:17.873
It could all work out.

09:17.908 --> 09:20.743
They are extremely high risks.

09:20.778 --> 09:22.789
If you have your daughter
go through with this pregnancy,

09:22.813 --> 09:26.882
There is a chance that
she will not survive.

09:26.917 --> 09:29.885
She's hardly living as it is.

09:29.920 --> 09:34.256
If she dies giving birth,
maybe that's a merciful outcome.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.260
Sometimes, I've wished for that.

09:40.898 --> 09:43.132
There is another issue
to consider.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.267
Given the abuse
your daughter has undergone,

09:45.302 --> 09:48.270
<i>Do you believe that she would
want to keep this pregnancy?</i>

09:49.940 --> 09:52.141
In any case,

09:52.176 --> 09:55.110
You are teresa's guardians,

09:55.146 --> 09:57.780
And therefore speak
on her behalf.

09:57.815 --> 10:00.015
Your wishes will be honored.

10:04.488 --> 10:07.556
So based on the echo
and the ct scans,

10:07.591 --> 10:10.492
Your daughter is suffering from
a congenital heart condition.

10:10.528 --> 10:13.896
Known as tetralogy of fallot.

10:13.931 --> 10:15.297
It's a condition that puts.

10:15.332 --> 10:17.132
A significant amount of stress
on the heart,

10:17.168 --> 10:19.435
And it's something that needs
to be addressed surgically.

10:19.470 --> 10:21.303
I can pay.
I bought travel insurance.

10:21.338 --> 10:24.273
It's an emergency surgery.
We would operate regardless.

10:24.308 --> 10:26.241
We'll take your daughter
to the pediatric icu,

10:26.277 --> 10:27.976
And get her ready.

10:31.015 --> 10:32.981
Are you all right?
I know this is a lot.

10:33.017 --> 10:35.184
I'm fine. Mommy?

10:42.159 --> 10:44.593
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
you sure you're okay?

10:44.628 --> 10:46.295
Maybe I should take
a look at you.

10:46.330 --> 10:48.030
No, no, I haven't had
anything to eat...

10:48.065 --> 10:50.099
No sleep. I'll be okay.

10:51.535 --> 10:54.870
Hey, april, so sorry to
hear about the baby.

10:54.905 --> 10:58.507
How you holding up?
It's okay. I'm okay.

11:10.187 --> 11:12.121
Talk to me, cesar.

11:12.156 --> 11:13.388
Suicide attempt.

11:13.424 --> 11:15.290
15-year-old female
from county psych.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.192
She swallowed bleach,
sodium hydroxide,

11:17.228 --> 11:20.229
And some sort of rust remover.
Hydrofluoric acid.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.397
Okay, call toxicology,
get an ng tube in her,

11:22.433 --> 11:24.199
Push an amp
of calcium gluconate,

11:24.235 --> 11:25.134
And hang a magnesium drip.

11:25.169 --> 11:27.536
Watch for v-tach,
and get a psych consult.

11:27.571 --> 11:29.371
You have to get
dr. Reese for me.

11:29.406 --> 11:31.006
I need to talk to her.

11:36.788 --> 11:38.555
I wasn't trying
to commit suicide.

11:38.591 --> 11:40.235
Offering classes in english
I was trying to see you.

11:40.259 --> 11:42.226
Do you believe it's okay
to hurt yourself?

11:42.261 --> 11:43.861
How else could I get to you?

11:43.896 --> 11:45.896
It's not like I can ask
for a phone call.

11:45.931 --> 11:48.732
Nancy, you... you could have
seriously hurt.

11:48.768 --> 11:50.467
Or even killed yourself.

11:50.503 --> 11:52.770
You have to help me
get out of there.

11:52.805 --> 11:55.639
They locked me up after
I got in a fight with my mom,

11:55.674 --> 11:57.908
But she's bipolar...
Has been for years.

11:57.943 --> 12:00.744
Hey, I'm sorry, but I'm...
I'm not your psychiatrist.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.579
My mom came at me with a hammer.

12:02.615 --> 12:04.481
While I was sleeping.

12:04.517 --> 12:06.483
I was trying to defend myself.

12:06.519 --> 12:07.985
That doesn't make me crazy.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.487
No. If that were the situation,

12:10.523 --> 12:12.556
It would be reasonable
to defend yourself.

12:12.591 --> 12:14.758
See?

12:14.794 --> 12:17.494
You're the only one
who said that.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.430
All the other doctors think
I'm psychotic,

12:19.465 --> 12:22.332
But my mom's
the one who's crazy.

12:22.368 --> 12:24.001
Dr. Reese?

12:24.036 --> 12:26.603
Could I speak to you
for a second?

12:26.639 --> 12:28.472
I'll be right back.

12:33.379 --> 12:35.579
Yeah, could... could you...
Could you fill me in?

12:35.614 --> 12:38.315
I understand that
you ran into nancy on...

12:38.350 --> 12:40.284
On rounds this morning? Yes.

12:40.319 --> 12:42.920
Could you have said anything.

12:42.955 --> 12:44.366
To make her think
it was a good idea.

12:44.390 --> 12:45.830
To come over here
and... and see you?

12:45.858 --> 12:49.493
All I said was "crazy"
isn't a word I ever use.

12:49.528 --> 12:52.763
Gotta be very careful.

12:52.798 --> 12:54.965
The way we talk to
younger psych patients.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.768
You know, they're much more
vulnerable to mixed messages.

12:57.803 --> 13:00.637
She seems to think that
you're some sort of ally.

13:00.673 --> 13:02.639
I am.

13:02.675 --> 13:03.607
Aren't we all?

13:03.642 --> 13:05.809
To get her
the right treatment, of course,

13:05.845 --> 13:07.644
But this is a young woman.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.681
Who purposefully drank
extremely toxic chemicals.

13:10.716 --> 13:12.783
I mean, nancy's been
diagnosed with.

13:12.818 --> 13:15.018
Borderline personality disorder.

13:15.054 --> 13:17.621
She has severe bouts
of manic depression.

13:17.656 --> 13:20.991
Uncontrollable hysteria,
paranoid delusions.

13:21.026 --> 13:22.793
People who suffer
from these disorders.

13:22.828 --> 13:25.729
Can be very persuasive,
very manipulative,

13:25.764 --> 13:27.498
And a danger to themselves,

13:27.533 --> 13:29.333
So we just...
We have to be careful.

13:29.368 --> 13:31.835
We wouldn't wanna
put her in a position.

13:31.871 --> 13:34.438
Where she wanted to
harm herself again.

13:38.744 --> 13:40.144
Ms. Cespedes?

13:42.748 --> 13:44.681
Can I get your signature
on this consent?

13:44.717 --> 13:46.884
This gives us
permission to operate.

13:55.628 --> 13:57.038
Ms. Cespedes,
you don't look well to me.

13:57.062 --> 13:58.902
You could've picked up a virus
while traveling.

13:58.931 --> 14:01.565
May I please check your pulse?

14:01.600 --> 14:04.034
Is everything all right?
I told you I'm fine.

14:04.069 --> 14:04.968
Please.

14:05.004 --> 14:06.837
Let's go back to
the emergency department,

14:06.872 --> 14:08.539
And let me take a look at you.

14:08.574 --> 14:12.042
Just show me
where the bathroom is, please.

14:12.077 --> 14:14.845
Yeah. Follow me.

14:25.791 --> 14:28.559
Hey. Her parents here?

14:28.594 --> 14:30.928
No, making calls outside...

14:30.963 --> 14:32.396
Looking for a new care facility.

14:33.766 --> 14:35.446
Did you hear
they wanna keep the pregnancy?

14:37.102 --> 14:40.571
When you can't talk,
you don't get to say nothing.

14:40.606 --> 14:42.940
Yeah, well, I don't think
it's the right thing.

14:44.677 --> 14:45.909
Maggie?

14:48.948 --> 14:50.781
Did you see that?

14:50.816 --> 14:53.650
I know pvs patients do that,
and it's just a reflex,

14:53.686 --> 14:56.787
But didn't it seem like
there was more going on?

14:56.822 --> 14:59.890
Wishful thinking.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.227
Teresa, can you hear me?

15:03.262 --> 15:06.196
If you can hear me,
please open your eyes.

15:15.140 --> 15:19.610
Teresa, if you can hear me,
squeeze my hand.

15:26.218 --> 15:30.087
In my time at the vent farm,
I've seen this a lot...

15:30.122 --> 15:34.691
Blinking, spasms,
sudden jerks of movement.

15:34.727 --> 15:37.261
Never ends up meaning
what you want it to.

15:43.869 --> 15:46.203
Let's get a ct brain.

15:46.238 --> 15:49.573
On a five-year coma patient?
Just in case.

15:58.150 --> 16:00.117
Hey, sarah,

16:00.152 --> 16:01.818
You... you got a second?

16:01.854 --> 16:04.054
I heard that,

16:04.089 --> 16:06.123
Most of the psych residents
get therapy.

16:06.158 --> 16:07.958
Yeah.

16:07.993 --> 16:10.994
Have you tried it?

16:11.030 --> 16:13.196
Um, I'm... i'm sorry.
Can we talk later?

16:13.232 --> 16:15.165
Sure. Yeah.

16:17.569 --> 16:18.869
How's she doing?

16:18.904 --> 16:20.537
Well, we've flushed her
pretty good.

16:20.572 --> 16:21.616
She'll be
medically cleared soon,

16:21.640 --> 16:23.907
And will have to go back to
the psych hospital.

16:25.210 --> 16:28.745
You buy her story? I don't know.

16:28.781 --> 16:30.547
She's on a six-month psych hold.

16:30.582 --> 16:32.861
Does she seems like she requires
that much time locked up?

16:32.885 --> 16:36.186
Don't ask me.
Psych's way too spongy.

16:36.221 --> 16:38.689
In med school, my head-shrink
professor took us to the mall,

16:38.724 --> 16:41.858
And asked us to point out people
we thought were mentally ill.

16:41.894 --> 16:44.194
No one could agree.

16:44.229 --> 16:46.863
That is when I knew
I wanted to be an ed doc.

16:46.899 --> 16:49.232
Much clearer business. Yeah.

16:49.268 --> 16:50.901
I wish there was a way
to evaluate nancy.

16:50.936 --> 16:52.703
Like an ed doc.

16:52.738 --> 16:53.904
Well, maybe there is.

16:53.939 --> 16:57.174
Like I tell my residents,
always go back to the history.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.847
Mommy?

17:03.882 --> 17:05.682
Mommy?

17:05.718 --> 17:06.849
Where's my mommy?

17:06.885 --> 17:08.630
Hey, bruna, she's out
in the waiting room right now.

17:08.654 --> 17:09.920
I need her.

17:09.954 --> 17:10.787
You're gonna be okay,
sweetheart.

17:10.823 --> 17:13.056
We're gonna take
very good care of you.

17:13.092 --> 17:15.092
Marty, now might be a good time.

17:15.127 --> 17:17.961
To start the sedation.
Please, I want my mommy.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.596
Hold on, marty.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.965
I would want my mom too.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.902
If I were in a new place
with new people.

17:35.180 --> 17:39.249
You know what?
Everyone here has one job,

17:39.284 --> 17:41.918
And that is to make you
feel better.

17:41.954 --> 17:43.754
And by the time we're finished,

17:43.789 --> 17:45.288
You won't have
trouble breathing.

17:45.324 --> 17:47.724
You won't faint on airplanes.

17:47.760 --> 17:50.093
You'll be a healthy little girl.

17:50.129 --> 17:51.762
How does that sound to you?

17:51.797 --> 17:54.998
You can really fix me? Yes.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.267
Now I need you to do
something for me.

17:57.302 --> 17:59.836
Can you count to 100?
In spanish?

17:59.872 --> 18:02.639
And by the time you're finished,

18:02.674 --> 18:04.341
Your mother will be
right next to you.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.810
I promise.

18:06.845 --> 18:09.813
Uno...

18:09.848 --> 18:13.083
Dos...

18:13.118 --> 18:15.152
Tres...

18:21.994 --> 18:23.827
Hey, april.
Is she still in there?

18:23.862 --> 18:25.140
Says she's okay,
but keeps vomiting.

18:25.164 --> 18:27.130
Won't open the door,
so I called maintenance.

18:27.166 --> 18:30.801
Zulmira...

18:30.836 --> 18:32.046
Zulmira, open the door, please.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.671
Hold on. I got this.

18:37.176 --> 18:39.209
Just give me a minute.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.844
Stay away.

18:44.183 --> 18:47.184
It was the only way
I could get her to america.

18:47.219 --> 18:48.985
April, what's going on?
I'll be fine.

18:52.858 --> 18:55.358
She just needed a good hospital.

18:55.394 --> 18:58.161
Okay... she's overdosing!

18:59.832 --> 19:02.032
How do you know?
She's a drug mule.

19:10.532 --> 19:12.111
Blood glucose is good,
but tachycardic as hell.

19:12.135 --> 19:15.003
Bp's 150 over 110.
Heart rate, 150.

19:15.038 --> 19:16.549
There's still two packets
in your stomach.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.206
One of them
appears to be leaking.

19:18.241 --> 19:21.009
We need to know. Is it cocaine?

19:21.044 --> 19:24.145
Just so we can help you.

19:26.049 --> 19:26.881
Yes.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.127
Okay, we need to
get these out now.

19:28.151 --> 19:29.250
Before they burst.

19:29.286 --> 19:31.030
Let's get an egd scope
and 70 milligrams of ketamine.

19:31.054 --> 19:33.388
You can't take it out.
You'll die of an overdose.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.634
If any more cocaine
leaks into your intestine.

19:34.658 --> 19:37.458
Can you give me medicine?
No, we need to remove them.

19:37.494 --> 19:39.327
Would you give it to the police?

19:41.331 --> 19:42.897
We'll explain
the situation to them.

19:42.933 --> 19:44.866
No, I can't go to prison
in my country.

19:44.901 --> 19:46.234
They'll kill me.

19:46.269 --> 19:49.103
Bruna needs me.
She will starve without me.

19:50.340 --> 19:51.384
Tell goodwin
we need a court order.

19:51.408 --> 19:52.874
To remove the drug packets.

19:52.909 --> 19:54.053
She'll be dead
by the time it's approved.

19:54.077 --> 19:54.876
Call pd.

19:54.911 --> 19:56.055
Maybe they can bring a warrant
in time.

19:56.079 --> 19:58.079
Please, just leave me alone.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.381
Zulmera, if you don't let us
remove those packets,

20:00.417 --> 20:04.319
You will die.

20:04.354 --> 20:07.021
I-I can't go to prison.

20:09.592 --> 20:11.993
Do you want bruna
to wake up from surgery.

20:12.028 --> 20:14.529
And learn that
her mother has died?

20:14.564 --> 20:18.399
You can't help her in any way
if you're dead.

20:18.435 --> 20:21.202
Let us keep you alive, please.

20:23.306 --> 20:24.450
Okay.
All right, come on, let's go.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.541
Yeah.

20:38.621 --> 20:40.433
You think there's any chance
of brain activity?

20:40.457 --> 20:41.723
I don't see how.

20:41.758 --> 20:43.725
A lot of brain volume loss
and atrophy.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.260
This is not the healthy brain
of a 25-year-old.

20:46.296 --> 20:47.428
But even with some atrophy,

20:47.464 --> 20:49.530
Couldn't there still be
consciousness?

20:49.566 --> 20:52.066
What was her glasgow coma score?

20:52.102 --> 20:54.102
There was no response.

20:54.137 --> 20:56.437
Yeah, this woman is in
a persistent vegetative state...

20:56.473 --> 20:58.706
My guess,
for the rest of her life.

20:58.742 --> 21:01.409
But I'm almost sure
I saw something in her eyes,

21:01.444 --> 21:04.579
Like she was aware of us
talking about her or something.

21:04.614 --> 21:08.616
Maybe you want that so much,
you're projecting?

21:08.651 --> 21:10.985
I... i don't know.

21:11.021 --> 21:13.287
I do feel terrible for her.

21:13.323 --> 21:15.123
She's pregnant.

21:15.158 --> 21:17.392
She was sexually assaulted
at her care facility,

21:17.427 --> 21:19.060
And her parents wanna
keep the baby.

21:19.095 --> 21:20.762
I just...

21:20.797 --> 21:22.630
If I could somehow
get through to teresa,

21:22.665 --> 21:25.400
She might finally have a say
in what happens to her.

21:25.435 --> 21:28.169
I'm sorry, natalie.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.571
You know what,
I want a neurology consult.

21:30.607 --> 21:32.473
Have abrams take a look.

21:34.511 --> 21:36.411
Dr. Charles,
do you have a minute?

21:36.446 --> 21:38.446
I do.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.783
In order to get
a more complete history,

21:41.818 --> 21:43.484
I contacted the officer.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.787
Who arrested nancy
and her mother.

21:45.822 --> 21:46.788
He sent me his report.

21:46.823 --> 21:49.323
It said they often get called
to nancy's house.

21:49.359 --> 21:51.759
On domestic disputes
involving the mother.

21:51.795 --> 21:53.661
She's been in and out of jail
for assault.

21:53.696 --> 21:55.696
In fact,
she is at county right now.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.331
Please take a look.

21:57.367 --> 21:59.600
This could just mean that,
you know,

21:59.636 --> 22:01.669
Mental illness runs in...
In nancy's family,

22:01.704 --> 22:04.305
And she and her mom suffer
from the same disorder.

22:04.340 --> 22:05.440
Or it could mean that

22:05.475 --> 22:08.509
Nancy was wrongfully committed
by an unstable mother.

22:08.545 --> 22:10.178
The one thing we know for sure...

22:10.213 --> 22:13.548
It was her mother's testimony
that got nancy committed,

22:13.583 --> 22:16.651
And her mother's
an unreliable witness.

22:19.489 --> 22:21.155
We have a seven-year-old female,

22:21.191 --> 22:23.691
Here for reconstruction
of tetralogy of fallot.

22:23.726 --> 22:26.694
Once we are in the chest
and on bypass, we will relieve.

22:26.729 --> 22:29.697
The right ventricular
outflow tract stenosis.

22:29.732 --> 22:31.365
Scalpel?

22:33.837 --> 22:36.304
I want you to observe
as I start at the sternal notch.

22:36.339 --> 22:39.440
And cut to the xiphoid.

22:49.119 --> 22:50.485
Dr. Latham?

22:53.890 --> 22:56.257
Dr. Latham, is everything okay?

22:56.292 --> 22:58.526
Yes, yes, dr. Rhodes.

23:03.233 --> 23:04.732
All right, I got it.

23:04.767 --> 23:07.468
Okay, one left.

23:08.705 --> 23:10.745
She'll be waking soon.
Dose her again with ketamine?

23:10.773 --> 23:13.207
No, let's just finish this.

23:25.121 --> 23:27.421
Okay. Go ahead, jeff.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.425
Almost there.

23:36.132 --> 23:37.598
All right, I got it.

23:37.634 --> 23:39.700
Okay, pulling it out.

23:42.906 --> 23:44.083
I think it burst
in her esophagus.

23:44.107 --> 23:46.374
Give her 20 more of labetolol,
and start an esmolol drip.

23:46.409 --> 23:48.287
Jeff, get the crash cart ready,
and give me the nitro.

23:48.311 --> 23:50.411
Got it.

23:50.446 --> 23:51.746
Just lie back. Stay calm.

23:54.784 --> 23:56.504
She's having a cocaine-induced
heart attack.

23:58.788 --> 24:01.322
Giver her two of versed iv.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.291
Open your mouth,
open your mouth.

24:03.326 --> 24:04.637
I'm gonna spray nitroglycerin
under your tongue.

24:04.661 --> 24:07.728
It'll make you feel better.

24:13.870 --> 24:16.470
St segments are improving.

24:16.506 --> 24:18.239
Does your chest still hurt?

24:18.274 --> 24:20.308
No.

24:20.343 --> 24:23.444
Sats are good.
Okay, heart rate, 120s.

24:23.479 --> 24:25.546
She's out and stable.

24:27.350 --> 24:28.716
Okay, what's the call?

24:31.287 --> 24:34.322
We don't have a choice.
We got to report it.

24:34.357 --> 24:36.502
Look, this was the only way
she could get her daughter.

24:36.526 --> 24:37.959
The operation she needed.

24:39.796 --> 24:42.430
Why can't we destroy it?
Who would that harm?

24:42.465 --> 24:45.199
Smuggling cocaine
is a serious crime.

24:45.235 --> 24:48.169
If she made it to her dealers,

24:48.204 --> 24:51.505
People would've been harmed,
possibly kids.

24:51.541 --> 24:53.207
She can't just
get away with that.

24:53.243 --> 24:55.676
She hasn't. Look at her.

24:55.712 --> 24:57.845
Five minutes ago,
her heart wasn't beating.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.046
April... no.

24:59.082 --> 25:01.882
She wasn't trying to deliver it.
She was trying to flush it.

25:01.918 --> 25:03.384
To destroy evidence.

25:03.419 --> 25:06.354
As of now,
it's a victimless crime.

25:06.389 --> 25:08.522
She is a good mother,

25:08.558 --> 25:10.191
Who did the only thing
she knew how.

25:10.226 --> 25:12.226
To help her daughter.

25:12.262 --> 25:15.196
If we destroy this packet,

25:15.231 --> 25:18.532
We'll be committing a crime.

25:18.568 --> 25:19.900
We don't have a choice.

25:19.936 --> 25:22.370
He's right.

25:24.674 --> 25:26.707
Sorry.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.158
Dr. Manning. Yes.

25:35.193 --> 25:37.427
Where are we
with teresa's treatment?

25:37.462 --> 25:38.940
I'd like to run
a few more blood tests.

25:38.964 --> 25:40.930
To rule out
any potential infection,

25:40.966 --> 25:42.999
And I'd also like to look into
physical therapy.

25:43.034 --> 25:46.002
Are there any medical issues
you're still treating?

25:46.037 --> 25:47.837
No, um,

25:47.873 --> 25:49.839
We've treated
the vaginal bleeding.

25:49.875 --> 25:51.775
Then it's time to discharge her.

25:51.810 --> 25:54.010
Her parents have found
a new care facility,

25:54.045 --> 25:56.079
And they're eager to get
their daughter settled in.

25:56.114 --> 25:57.914
How do we know
teresa will be safe?

25:57.949 --> 26:00.683
How do we know
she won't get abused again?

26:00.719 --> 26:03.086
She has suffered so much.
I just...

26:03.121 --> 26:04.888
Just what?

26:06.792 --> 26:08.591
What can you do?

26:08.627 --> 26:09.926
We all wish we could do more,

26:09.961 --> 26:11.628
But our job is
to treat the ailment.

26:11.663 --> 26:13.763
That brought the patient in,

26:13.799 --> 26:15.431
And that's all.

26:20.705 --> 26:23.106
It's time to give her back
to her parents.

26:26.678 --> 26:29.012
We've finished the repair,
and now coming off bypass.

26:29.047 --> 26:30.647
We're off bypass.

26:30.682 --> 26:33.616
At the end of any surgery,
when the patient has been...

26:33.652 --> 26:36.619
Pulmonary artery pressure is 50.

26:36.655 --> 26:38.688
Coming up to 70.
And the left ventricular?

26:38.723 --> 26:39.789
100.

26:39.825 --> 26:42.826
Well, let's not get excited.
She'll ride it out.

26:42.861 --> 26:44.994
It's dropping... 80.

26:45.030 --> 26:46.496
Should we put her
back on bypass?

26:46.531 --> 26:47.831
We... we... I think we should...

26:47.866 --> 26:50.333
We... we... should...
She's throwing pvcs.

26:50.368 --> 26:51.568
75.

26:51.603 --> 26:53.403
Pulmonary hypertension's
getting worse.

26:53.438 --> 26:54.482
Your graft has to be stenotic.

26:54.506 --> 26:56.673
Bypass, dr. Latham.
We need to fix the graft.

26:56.708 --> 26:59.509
We could try a...
Pul-pulmonary vasodilator.

26:59.544 --> 27:01.689
Vasodilator's not gonna do it.
We need to open her back up.

27:01.713 --> 27:03.146
Blood pressure's
dropping rapidly.

27:03.181 --> 27:04.480
We're losing her. Dr. Latham...

27:04.516 --> 27:07.016
She's peri-arrest. Dr. Latham...

27:11.423 --> 27:13.823
Step away, dr. Latham.

27:13.859 --> 27:16.693
Step away.

27:16.728 --> 27:18.928
Marty, re-dose of heparin.
Let's get her back on bypass.

27:18.964 --> 27:20.864
I'm reopening the heart.

27:36.481 --> 27:38.181
There you are.

27:38.216 --> 27:39.616
Hey, how 'bout we, um...

27:39.651 --> 27:41.851
How 'bout we hang out
after work?

27:41.887 --> 27:44.554
Yeah, maybe go get some of your
favorite fries or something.

27:44.589 --> 27:45.955
Noah, please. I get it,

27:45.991 --> 27:49.025
But just give me
some space, okay?

27:57.102 --> 27:58.735
So I understand that
you believe that.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.203
You've been
wrongfully committed.

28:00.238 --> 28:02.739
Is that right? Yes, definitely.

28:03.642 --> 28:06.609
Ever been hospitalized
before, nancy?

28:06.645 --> 28:09.078
Besides for the night my mom
attacked me with a hammer?

28:09.114 --> 28:11.080
No.

28:11.116 --> 28:13.549
You wanna tell me a little bit
about your mom?

28:13.585 --> 28:15.952
I would. Finally.

28:15.987 --> 28:17.620
Hi, nancy. How are you?

28:20.792 --> 28:21.925
Okay.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.760
I'm dr. Baker,
nancy's psychiatrist.

28:23.795 --> 28:25.561
Dan charles. Nice to meet you.

28:25.597 --> 28:27.730
This is dr. Halstead,
and I think you know dr. Reese.

28:27.766 --> 28:30.800
Yes, I'm glad to see
our girl here is in good hands.

28:30.835 --> 28:33.002
When will she be discharged?
She's clear.

28:33.038 --> 28:34.671
We just need to remove
the ng tube,

28:34.706 --> 28:36.139
And she'll be ready to go.

28:36.174 --> 28:37.240
Good.

28:38.777 --> 28:40.777
Do you mind? Could I get
a quick word outside?

28:40.812 --> 28:42.879
Of course.

28:46.151 --> 28:47.817
Are you aware that
nancy's mother has.

28:47.852 --> 28:50.954
An extensive arrest record?
No, I wasn't.

28:50.989 --> 28:51.989
Why?

28:52.023 --> 28:54.524
Well, it seems that
she might've been committed.

28:54.559 --> 28:57.260
Largely based on
her mother's version of events.

28:57.295 --> 28:58.372
Dr. Charles, nancy was committed.

28:58.396 --> 29:00.964
Because I deemed her
a threat to herself and others.

29:00.999 --> 29:02.999
I... i was just wondering.

29:03.034 --> 29:05.868
If you thought that there was
any chance that,

29:05.904 --> 29:08.638
Your assessment
might've been colored by.

29:08.673 --> 29:10.974
A potentially unreliable history
given by the mother.

29:11.009 --> 29:13.209
My assessment was colored by
20 years of experience.

29:13.244 --> 29:15.812
In adolescent psychiatry.
And quite frankly,

29:15.847 --> 29:17.024
I don't appreciate
being second-guessed.

29:17.048 --> 29:19.782
By a doctor who's only known
my patient for one afternoon.

29:19.818 --> 29:21.662
I just saw the potential
for a biased narrative,

29:21.686 --> 29:23.686
And I wanted to make sure
you had all the facts.

29:23.722 --> 29:25.221
A biased narrative.

29:25.256 --> 29:26.990
As nancy's
court-appointed doctor,

29:27.025 --> 29:30.526
I'd advise you to worry about
your own patients, dr. Charles.

29:33.598 --> 29:36.632
Hey, are you discharging her?

29:36.668 --> 29:38.801
I just finished
the paperwork now.

29:42.774 --> 29:45.008
Dr. Manning. Yes.

29:45.043 --> 29:46.242
Your coma patient...

29:46.277 --> 29:50.313
Given the abysmal treatment
she received at that facility,

29:50.348 --> 29:51.681
I couldn't help but wonder.

29:51.716 --> 29:53.516
What other ways
they might've failed her,

29:53.551 --> 29:55.985
So I reviewed her history.
Did you find anything?

29:56.021 --> 29:57.887
I'm afraid not,
but I do have one question.

29:57.922 --> 30:00.656
What time of day
did you perform that neuro exam?

30:00.692 --> 30:02.325
Morning. Why?

30:02.360 --> 30:04.193
Sometimes,
traumatic brain injuries.

30:04.229 --> 30:05.661
Result in a patient developing.

30:05.697 --> 30:07.697
Irregular sleep/wake
circadian cycles,

30:07.732 --> 30:10.867
So it's possible
teresa's become nocturnal.

30:10.902 --> 30:12.702
I suggest we try
that test again.

30:12.737 --> 30:14.070
Great.

30:15.774 --> 30:17.707
Mr. And mrs. Azen...

30:17.742 --> 30:20.043
This is dr. Abrams,
chief of neurosurgery.

30:20.078 --> 30:23.246
Do you mind if we perform
one more test on your daughter?

30:23.281 --> 30:25.848
Well, the emts from her
new facility are on their way.

30:25.884 --> 30:28.051
It should just take a moment.

30:31.923 --> 30:35.658
Teresa, if you can hear me,
please open your eyes.

30:38.596 --> 30:40.229
I've asked her that
a million times.

30:40.265 --> 30:43.099
I know.
Just bear with me a moment.

30:44.903 --> 30:47.070
Teresa, if you can hear me,

30:47.105 --> 30:49.806
Please move your eyes
side to side.

30:53.678 --> 30:55.778
I'm sorry.

30:55.814 --> 30:57.246
I finished teresa's discharge.

30:57.282 --> 30:59.215
As soon as
her transportation arrives...

30:59.250 --> 31:00.250
Hold on.

31:00.285 --> 31:04.387
There's a condition
called locked-in syndrome.

31:04.422 --> 31:06.322
If your daughter has it,
she'd be conscious,

31:06.357 --> 31:09.058
But she wouldn't be able to
move her eyes side to side.

31:09.094 --> 31:11.327
She could, however, move them...

31:11.362 --> 31:12.962
Well, let's see.

31:14.699 --> 31:15.865
Teresa...

31:15.900 --> 31:18.835
I need you to move your eyes
up and down for me, please.

31:18.870 --> 31:20.303
Up and down.

31:22.107 --> 31:23.906
Did you see that?

31:23.942 --> 31:26.109
What was that?

31:26.144 --> 31:28.010
Teresa, if you can hear me,

31:28.046 --> 31:31.380
Please move your eyes
up and down again.

31:37.322 --> 31:38.921
My god.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.209
I don't understand.

31:51.244 --> 31:53.277
How did you wake her
from the coma? Come after me?

31:53.313 --> 31:54.212
I didn't.

31:54.247 --> 31:57.548
I don't believe
she ever was in a coma.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.116
What?

31:59.152 --> 32:00.451
We need more tests
to be certain,

32:00.487 --> 32:03.154
But it's my opinion
that her accident caused.

32:03.189 --> 32:04.789
A stroke to the brain stem,

32:04.824 --> 32:06.424
Which included
the basilar artery.

32:06.459 --> 32:07.358
What does that mean?

32:07.393 --> 32:09.994
The stroke left her
completely paralyzed,

32:10.029 --> 32:11.395
But still conscious.

32:11.431 --> 32:13.097
Locked-in syndrome...

32:13.132 --> 32:17.568
She's awake,
but locked in her body.

32:17.604 --> 32:20.471
All these years?

32:20.507 --> 32:24.008
She's always been awake?

32:24.043 --> 32:25.910
Yes.

32:25.945 --> 32:30.081
She heard everything we said...

32:30.116 --> 32:31.816
I said.

32:31.851 --> 32:33.985
And she was conscious.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.954
While some monster
assaulted her?

32:36.990 --> 32:39.323
My poor baby.

32:41.060 --> 32:44.295
I know, it's so terrible.
I'm so sorry.

32:44.330 --> 32:47.164
But at least
you haven't lost her.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.500
It's possible.

32:49.536 --> 32:53.137
That some of her paralysis
is the result of spasticity,

32:53.172 --> 32:55.172
And it's therefore treatable.

32:55.208 --> 32:57.341
With muscle relaxants
and physical therapy.

32:57.377 --> 32:59.544
Wait, will she get better?

32:59.579 --> 33:01.112
She'll never be
fully functional,

33:01.147 --> 33:04.448
But she should
regain some movement.

33:04.484 --> 33:07.485
We can also order
an infrared eye-tracking device.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.186
That'll allow teresa
to communicate.

33:09.222 --> 33:11.622
Through a computer. Communicate?

33:11.658 --> 33:12.857
Yeah. And she'll be able to.

33:12.892 --> 33:14.392
Put together words
and sentences.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.160
You'll be able to
have a conversation.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.296
With your daughter again.

33:18.331 --> 33:21.966
A conversation?

33:22.001 --> 33:23.968
With my little girl?

33:24.003 --> 33:25.536
Thank you.

33:25.572 --> 33:28.639
We'll give you time alone
with your daughter now.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.111
Thank you.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.385
Sarah?

33:41.421 --> 33:43.087
Th-they're telling me
to get dressed.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.423
They're sending me back.
I know. I'm sorry.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.659
Sarah, please, help me.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.361
I tried. I did,

33:50.396 --> 33:53.230
But dr. Baker has
conservatorship over you.

33:53.266 --> 33:54.231
According to the courts,

33:54.267 --> 33:56.534
She has to be the one
to change the diagnosis,

33:56.569 --> 33:58.169
And we couldn't change her mind.

34:00.073 --> 34:03.107
Hey, I'm not giving up,

34:03.142 --> 34:06.043
And you can't either.
Stay strong.

34:06.079 --> 34:09.179
We'll figure something else out.

34:09.215 --> 34:11.248
Okay?

34:16.289 --> 34:17.420
Give me a second.

34:19.993 --> 34:22.592
Dr. Charles, I know I don't have
any definitive proof,

34:22.629 --> 34:23.672
But she is sane. I know it.

34:23.696 --> 34:24.940
We can't let her go back.
Slow down, dr. Reese.

34:24.964 --> 34:29.065
Dr. Baker just doesn't want to
admit that she misdiagnosed her.

34:29.101 --> 34:31.101
You know what,
I happen to agree with you.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.003
I'm filing an appeal.

34:32.038 --> 34:34.138
You... you don't think
she's mentally ill?

34:34.172 --> 34:36.072
Can't be positive,
but either way,

34:36.109 --> 34:38.074
She should not be locked up
on a long-term hold.

34:38.110 --> 34:40.277
Based solely on
her mother's testimony.

34:40.313 --> 34:42.112
Need some help! Treatment 1.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.052
What happened?
Give me some pressure.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.954
Must've grabbed the scalpel
from the cart.

34:49.989 --> 34:52.389
Tourniquet her arm,
and give me a hemostat.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.260
It's tied.
I-i'm not crazy, sarah.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.695
I-I'm not.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.350
Surgery turned out well today.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.385
Thanks to you, dr. Rhodes.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.667
It's been a long day,
dr. Latham.

35:24.691 --> 35:26.390
How 'bout a drink?

35:33.833 --> 35:36.267
SeÃƒÂ±orita cespedes...

35:41.708 --> 35:43.074
Gracias.

35:46.379 --> 35:48.079
We need to talk to goodwin.

35:55.388 --> 35:59.490
Trafficking of cocaine
is a felony.

35:59.525 --> 36:03.360
That means calling
the dea, homeland,

36:03.396 --> 36:04.829
The whole nine yards.

36:04.864 --> 36:07.531
All that over one packet?

36:07.567 --> 36:11.068
Well, if the evidence
is just this one,

36:11.104 --> 36:15.106
That doesn't demonstrate intent
to traffic and sell.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.109
Were there more?

36:19.679 --> 36:21.712
No.

36:21.748 --> 36:23.614
The one packet is all we found.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.318
That's correct.

36:29.522 --> 36:32.389
Dr. Choi?

36:32.425 --> 36:34.492
Anything to add?

36:36.262 --> 36:38.162
Dr. Choi...

36:42.602 --> 36:44.135
No.

36:47.874 --> 36:50.141
Then that's that.

37:02.789 --> 37:04.555
Thank you, dr. Choi.

37:05.892 --> 37:09.426
Do not put me
in that position again...

37:09.462 --> 37:11.162
Either of you.

37:16.135 --> 37:18.269
I don't know that
I helped zulmera.

37:18.304 --> 37:21.272
She still has to deal with
the people whose drugs she lost.

37:21.307 --> 37:23.440
She is a resourceful woman.

37:23.476 --> 37:24.208
She's gonna do what she needs.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.709
To take care of
that little girl.

37:25.745 --> 37:28.779
I had to at least
try to help her.

37:28.815 --> 37:31.882
If I had a child,
I would've done the same thing.

37:31.918 --> 37:34.185
I know.

37:35.254 --> 37:37.721
Thank you.

37:37.757 --> 37:40.591
And thank you for earlier...

37:40.626 --> 37:42.426
About the baby.

37:49.802 --> 37:52.436
It's my fault.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.238
Why'd you say that?

37:54.273 --> 37:56.473
I gave her false hope.

37:56.509 --> 37:58.175
I told her I believed
she was stable.

37:58.211 --> 38:01.645
When she clearly isn't.
I'm not sure I agree.

38:01.681 --> 38:04.915
I mean, just made her case
a little tougher,

38:04.951 --> 38:08.319
But I'm still gonna
file the appeal.

38:08.354 --> 38:09.486
Why would you do that.

38:09.522 --> 38:11.488
When she just
tried to kill herself?

38:11.524 --> 38:14.491
Losing hope is not
a sign of mental illness.

38:14.527 --> 38:16.327
It's a sign of being human.

38:16.362 --> 38:19.363
I mean, the poor girl... she has
a violent, unstable mother,

38:19.398 --> 38:21.343
And her fate is in the hands
of this psychiatrist.

38:21.367 --> 38:23.767
Who doesn't believe
a word she says.

38:23.803 --> 38:25.970
I mean, given those odds,
I can absolutely understand.

38:26.005 --> 38:28.672
Why she'd fall into despair.

38:48.761 --> 38:51.295
Had to prove me wrong,
didn't ya?

38:56.402 --> 38:58.869
Looks like you're gonna
get your wish.

38:58.905 --> 39:00.971
She will have a say
in her future.

39:08.581 --> 39:11.649
Dr. Latham, you decide on
that drink after all?

39:14.921 --> 39:17.488
Maimonides... 12th century
rabbi and physician.

39:17.523 --> 39:20.858
He said that the risk
of a wrong decision.

39:20.893 --> 39:24.862
Is preferable to
the terror of indecision.

39:24.897 --> 39:26.597
I have never had
a moment like today.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.732
Before I started
my tms treatments.

39:28.768 --> 39:31.368
I wouldn't worry.
I doubt it'll happen again.

39:33.773 --> 39:35.584
That girl was more than
just a surgical challenge.

39:35.608 --> 39:38.742
She became a human being to me.

39:38.778 --> 39:40.778
I lost my detachment.

39:40.813 --> 39:43.447
I cannot afford that.

39:43.482 --> 39:46.650
I'm ending my treatments,
at least for the time being.

39:48.087 --> 39:49.264
Well, I'm sorry that
you feel like.

39:49.288 --> 39:52.890
You have to make that decision,
but I trust your judgement.

39:56.595 --> 39:57.928
When you started
your fellowship,

39:57.964 --> 40:00.831
I told you that
you were not my first choice.

40:02.969 --> 40:04.868
After working with you
these last months,

40:04.904 --> 40:07.404
I would like to say that
I cannot imagine.

40:07.440 --> 40:11.342
A finer surgeon or person
than you, dr. Rhodes.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.046
Thank you.

40:17.850 --> 40:21.051
Well, let's leave it at that.
Yeah.

40:21.087 --> 40:25.789
I would like a drink.
Scotch for me... neat.

40:25.825 --> 40:29.360
And another for my friend.

40:51.884 --> 40:54.018
Hey.

40:54.053 --> 40:56.120
Look, I'm... i'm sorry.

40:56.155 --> 40:59.490
Okay, I... i...
I don't know what to say.

40:59.525 --> 41:02.659
I got no clue
what you're going through,

41:02.695 --> 41:04.128
But I wish I could help.
