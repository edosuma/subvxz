01:28.900 --> 01:30.567
Fuck all, I'm just
around at the green.

01:32.775 --> 01:34.317
Why, what's up?

01:40.400 --> 01:42.942
Yeah, I might have
somebody, yeah.

01:46.692 --> 01:48.608
Here, come in for a second.
My brother wants us.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.608
- For what?
- Don't know.

01:52.483 --> 01:54.317
What's the craic? All right?

01:54.733 --> 01:55.983
Buzz into the gaff, yeah?

02:02.400 --> 02:04.442
Right, lads,
I'm going to give you the shit. Fuck 'em.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.400
Don't tell anybody
where you're hiding it.

02:06.483 --> 02:08.108
If anything goes missing,
I'm dead.

02:08.567 --> 02:09.858
Are you taking it, yeah?

02:10.358 --> 02:11.567
Yeah, no bother.

02:14.275 --> 02:15.567
I'll talk to you
after, all right?

02:15.650 --> 02:16.692
I appreciate that, all right?

02:16.775 --> 02:17.858
- No bother, yeah?
- See you later.

02:17.942 --> 02:19.025
See you.

02:35.108 --> 02:37.108
- Michael?
- Yeah.

03:06.858 --> 03:09.025
- All right, Grandad.
- Morning.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.358
It's cold.

03:14.441 --> 03:15.733
Is there any milk?

03:17.150 --> 03:18.108
It's looking at you.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.400
Is that all that's left?

03:22.775 --> 03:24.108
I'm off to the shops.

03:24.941 --> 03:26.066
Have toast.

03:38.733 --> 03:41.525
- What are you doing later?
- Meeting Orla.

04:15.983 --> 04:17.940
Barry's after texting me there, yeah?
He said, "Move that."

04:19.608 --> 04:21.649
- Do you want it back?
- No, he just said, "Move it."

04:22.316 --> 04:24.733
- Where am I supposed to move it?
- How am I supposed to know?

04:26.858 --> 04:28.275
Here, hold on, boys.

04:31.275 --> 04:33.900
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

05:07.816 --> 05:08.858
Who was that?

05:08.941 --> 05:10.983
It was just Gary.
It was nothing.

05:11.775 --> 05:13.066
I'd say so.

05:15.233 --> 05:16.358
It was.

05:16.525 --> 05:17.858
How was it nothing?

05:18.400 --> 05:19.566
It just was.

05:25.483 --> 05:26.691
Your dinner's ready.

05:30.108 --> 05:30.983
I have to go.

05:31.691 --> 05:32.733
See you later.

05:53.691 --> 05:55.108
Michael?

05:57.566 --> 06:00.150
I'm Detective Belton from
St. Donnan Garda Station.

06:00.691 --> 06:02.191
I have a warrant to
search this house.

06:02.941 --> 06:04.900
If you wouldn't mind going into the sitting room there for me, please, sir?

06:05.275 --> 06:06.358
Thank you very much.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.733
- For what?
- You too, sir, please.

06:08.816 --> 06:09.775
Thank you very much.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.858
Now sit down there, young man.

06:18.108 --> 06:19.275
This is a mistake.

06:19.358 --> 06:21.566
Sure, it'll all be cleared up in a minute.
Don't worry about it.

06:21.983 --> 06:23.150
Sit down there.

06:31.108 --> 06:33.025
Can I have another look
at that warrant, please?

06:33.108 --> 06:35.483
Did you not see it the first time?
It hasn't changed.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.441
Detective...

06:49.483 --> 06:51.025
- Is this your bag, Michael?
- Guard.

06:51.983 --> 06:53.358
- Michael, is this your bag?
- Guard.

06:53.441 --> 06:54.900
Sir, please.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.483
Michael?

06:57.941 --> 06:58.775
Yeah.

07:00.358 --> 07:01.441
All right, Michael.

07:02.275 --> 07:04.275
I'm arresting you
under Section 15

07:04.358 --> 07:06.608
of the Misuse of Drugs
Act 1977,

07:06.691 --> 07:10.275
for the possession of controlled drugs for unlawful sale or supply.

07:11.066 --> 07:14.066
Anything you say can be used in evidence against you in a court of law.

07:14.858 --> 07:16.691
You have the right
to a solicitor.

07:16.775 --> 07:17.900
If you cannot afford one,

07:17.983 --> 07:19.650
one will be provided to you.

07:19.733 --> 07:21.066
Do you understand your rights?

07:23.650 --> 07:24.650
Yeah.

07:25.025 --> 07:26.025
All right, stand up.

07:26.358 --> 07:27.900
Get up there, son.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.108
- Is that okay for you? Not too tight, no?
- No.

07:42.525 --> 07:43.858
I'll follow you down, Michael.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.858
Do you have a solicitor?
- I think so.

07:59.441 --> 08:02.441
- You don't know who it is, do you?
- My grandad knows.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.858
They're all in court now
anyway, until this evening.

08:05.733 --> 08:07.066
If you just tell us
who gave you the bag,

08:07.150 --> 08:08.941
and I can sort bail
and you can go home.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.858
Your da's in jail, isn't he?

08:22.983 --> 08:24.566
If you tell us
who gave you the bag,

08:25.399 --> 08:27.441
we'll see if we can get him out a little bit early.

08:27.524 --> 08:28.733
I'm not a rat.

08:29.441 --> 08:31.066
You're not
a dealer either, Michael.

08:36.607 --> 08:37.816
<i><font color=#ffffff>All right, so, Michael,</font></i>

08:37.899 --> 08:40.107
<i><font color=#ffffff>can you confirm your address</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>for me, please?</font></i>

08:41.316 --> 08:44.941
<i><font color=#ffffff>15 Fortune Avenue,</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>St. Donnan Estate.</font></i>

08:46.566 --> 08:47.774
<i><font color=#ffffff>Can you describe</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>the house?</font></i>

08:49.149 --> 08:51.233
<i><font color=#ffffff>It's brown</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>with a white door.</font></i>

08:53.108 --> 08:55.483
<i><font color=#ffffff>And your bedroom,</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>where is it in the house?</font></i>

08:56.274 --> 08:57.191
<i><font color=#ffffff>It's at the front.</font></i>

08:58.066 --> 08:58.983
<i><font color=#ffffff>All right.</font></i>

09:00.733 --> 09:01.816
<i><font color=#ffffff>Where were you this morning?</font></i>

09:03.191 --> 09:04.233
<i><font color=#ffffff>I was at home.</font></i>

09:06.983 --> 09:08.774
<i><font color=#ffffff>And can you</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>tell us what we found</font></i>

09:08.858 --> 09:10.816
in your bedroom this morning?

09:12.274 --> 09:13.608
No comment.

09:16.483 --> 09:18.899
You already told us
the bag was yours, Michael.

09:20.566 --> 09:21.524
Did you not?

09:24.483 --> 09:25.858
When I asked you this morning,

09:27.191 --> 09:29.899
"Was the bag yours?"
You said, "Yeah."

09:31.358 --> 09:32.358
Yeah.

09:32.816 --> 09:34.066
Good, okay.

09:38.399 --> 09:40.024
Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

09:41.691 --> 09:42.733
No.

09:45.316 --> 09:46.274
Okay.

10:04.024 --> 10:09.524
Okay, Michael,
I am charging you with possession of a Class A substance

10:09.608 --> 10:11.233
with intent to supply.

10:11.566 --> 10:13.274
And I'm granting you
station bail

10:13.358 --> 10:15.316
of one hundred euro, okay?

10:16.316 --> 10:19.149
Now you'll be due to appear
in Court on February 20th.

10:20.358 --> 10:21.649
Sign this, please.

10:25.149 --> 10:26.191
Have you anything to say?

10:27.858 --> 10:29.108
Can I have me phone back?

10:29.358 --> 10:30.816
It's being held in evidence.

10:31.858 --> 10:33.108
Get on to your solicitor.

10:40.108 --> 10:41.316
<i><font color=#ffffff>Why did you do it?</font></i>

10:42.316 --> 10:43.524
Gary's my mate.

10:44.233 --> 10:45.691
And you always do
what they tell you?

10:45.774 --> 10:46.816
No.

10:47.941 --> 10:49.358
I was supposed to move it.

10:49.941 --> 10:50.941
It's my own fault.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.566
Did you tell them anything?

10:54.108 --> 10:55.108
No.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.191
I called a solicitor.
You could go down for this, you know.

11:02.566 --> 11:04.608
- I know, yeah.
- Is that all you can say?

11:04.691 --> 11:06.024
Well what do you want me
to say?

11:06.941 --> 11:08.941
Just when we were
getting somewhere.

11:11.733 --> 11:12.858
They took my phone.

11:17.149 --> 11:18.483
I want it back.

11:19.066 --> 11:21.399
- Where are you going?
- Away from you.

11:28.899 --> 11:31.858
Hang on. What the fuck are you doing around here,
you stupid cunt?

11:31.941 --> 11:34.358
{\An3}-What?
- I told you to fucking move it.

11:34.441 --> 11:36.608
- I was going to.
- You were going to, what good is that?

11:37.358 --> 11:39.608
They showed up at my house.
I might go down for this.

11:39.691 --> 11:41.066
Well, it's your own
fucking fault.

11:41.483 --> 11:42.483
Come on, man.

11:42.566 --> 11:45.024
Stay away from here,
you fucking eejit.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.024
<i><font color=#ffffff>Did you hear?</font></i>

11:59.191 --> 12:00.274
<i><font color=#ffffff>Yeah.</font></i>

12:00.649 --> 12:01.649
<i><font color=#ffffff>Where are you?</font></i>

12:01.816 --> 12:02.941
I'm at the shops.

12:03.983 --> 12:05.858
- Can you come out?
- <i><font color=#ffffff>No.</font></i>

12:06.399 --> 12:07.566
<i><font color=#ffffff>My da won't let me.</font></i>

12:09.733 --> 12:10.858
Who told you?

12:11.608 --> 12:12.774
<i><font color=#ffffff>Everyone knows.</font></i>

12:14.108 --> 12:16.774
- <i><font color=#ffffff>Are you all right?</font></i>
- Yeah, I'm grand.

12:17.858 --> 12:19.108
<i><font color=#ffffff>Did you do it?</font></i>

12:19.274 --> 12:20.399
Do what?

12:20.899 --> 12:22.524
I was only holding a bag
for Gary.

12:24.566 --> 12:25.566
<i><font color=#ffffff>What's going to happen?</font></i>

12:27.274 --> 12:28.358
I don't know, do I?

12:32.941 --> 12:34.024
What are you doing?

12:35.274 --> 12:36.608
<i><font color=#ffffff>I'm watching "Pointless."</font></i>

12:37.649 --> 12:38.649
Who are you with?

12:39.524 --> 12:40.524
<i><font color=#ffffff>Ash.</font></i>

12:41.191 --> 12:42.191
<i><font color=#ffffff>I've to go.</font></i>

12:42.524 --> 12:43.691
<i><font color=#ffffff>Talk to you later, yeah?</font></i>

12:44.149 --> 12:45.399
See you later.

13:07.566 --> 13:08.983
You made a mistake.

13:15.691 --> 13:17.066
Do you think I'll go down?

13:22.524 --> 13:23.858
I don't know.

13:34.983 --> 13:36.441
I'm going to bed, yeah?

13:49.233 --> 13:51.858
<i><font color=#ffffff>Nothing before you turned 18 will be taken into account,</font></i>

13:51.941 --> 13:55.066
but your probation order last October will be a factor,
I'm afraid.

13:55.941 --> 13:57.482
Will he do time
for this?

13:58.191 --> 13:59.982
Well, be prepared
for it, Michael.

14:00.232 --> 14:02.191
He's not involved in drugs.

14:02.274 --> 14:05.107
It's enough involvement for a custodial sentence,
I'm afraid.

14:07.274 --> 14:08.941
Would you recommend
an early plea?

14:10.316 --> 14:12.232
Well, it's safer
to look at the evidence first.

14:12.316 --> 14:13.732
It might not be strong enough.

14:14.566 --> 14:16.482
But an early plea
will mean a lighter sentence?

14:16.566 --> 14:18.024
If convicted, yes.

14:23.107 --> 14:25.774
You're free to ignore my advice.
It's up to you.

14:28.732 --> 14:30.274
When did you leave school,
Michael?

14:31.357 --> 14:32.357
Fourth year.

14:33.566 --> 14:35.191
Tell him about that teacher.

14:35.274 --> 14:36.649
What's that got to do
with this?

14:36.732 --> 14:39.149
He was bullied
by a teacher at school.

14:42.357 --> 14:43.816
What did you
do then?

14:45.066 --> 14:46.649
Worked with my Grandad
for a bit.

14:47.649 --> 14:50.399
- Doing what?
- Painting and decorating.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.524
Then I started
Youth Reach last year.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.982
Well, I think we should get this over as quick as possible.

15:09.607 --> 15:10.816
I might not
go down.

15:12.649 --> 15:13.774
It doesn't matter.

15:16.274 --> 15:17.816
I can't go through it
with you.

15:18.982 --> 15:20.524
Your da
can't tell you what to do.

15:20.607 --> 15:21.691
It's not him.

15:22.066 --> 15:23.107
It is.

15:23.982 --> 15:25.191
I know it is.

15:27.024 --> 15:28.107
It's not.

15:32.274 --> 15:33.607
I'm only 16.

15:35.274 --> 15:36.524
I wasn't dealing.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.232
It was just a favor.

15:39.732 --> 15:40.816
I know.

15:47.691 --> 15:48.774
I wasn't dealing.

15:48.857 --> 15:50.232
{\An3}All right, you weren't dealing.

15:50.857 --> 15:52.107
I don't do that.

15:54.982 --> 15:57.566
{\An3}-I'm sorry.
- It's a bit late now, isn't it?

15:58.649 --> 15:59.941
Please.

16:00.191 --> 16:01.232
No.

16:01.732 --> 16:02.816
Where are you going?

16:03.566 --> 16:05.691
- Orla.
- Leave me alone.

16:46.982 --> 16:48.482
<i><font color=#ffffff>So,</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>just take responsibility.</font></i>

16:48.566 --> 16:50.816
<i><font color=#ffffff>Make a solemn promise you won't be in trouble with the law again.</font></i>

16:51.399 --> 16:52.524
No bother.

16:52.857 --> 16:54.524
Is there any more he can do?

16:55.066 --> 16:57.191
Just be respectful,
stand up straight

16:57.274 --> 16:59.232
Say, "Yes, Judge,"
"No, Judge."

16:59.316 --> 17:00.441
Hands by your side.

17:00.524 --> 17:03.232
- Yeah
- Okay? Ready to go?

17:10.607 --> 17:14.148
On the first of February,
I arrested Michael McCrea,

17:14.357 --> 17:18.607
under Section 15 of
the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977,

17:18.691 --> 17:23.191
for possession of controlled drugs for unlawful sale or supply.

17:24.023 --> 17:28.857
He was detained for questioning under Section 2 at St.
Donnan Garda Station.

17:29.274 --> 17:31.357
He was released
on station bail

17:31.441 --> 17:33.649
to appear before this court
this morning, Judge.

17:35.232 --> 17:36.191
Good morning, Judge,

17:36.274 --> 17:38.232
I appear on behalf of
Michael McCrea.

17:38.316 --> 17:40.107
Judge, I have
a Precis of Evidence

17:40.191 --> 17:42.691
and I'm requesting a short remand to take instructions.

17:43.024 --> 17:44.982
My client wishes to
plead guilty this morning.

17:45.066 --> 17:46.524
He is not working at present.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.441
He is a student,
currently studying at Youth Reach

17:49.524 --> 17:51.607
and will be making
an application for legal aid.

17:52.691 --> 17:54.149
Is there
any objection to this?

17:54.399 --> 17:55.566
No, Judge.

17:55.941 --> 17:59.316
Can I hear an outline of the facts for
consideration for jurisdiction, please?

17:59.399 --> 18:00.566
Yes, judge, um...

18:00.649 --> 18:05.691
The address 15 Fortune Avenue where Mr.
McCrea resides was searched

18:05.774 --> 18:10.107
and a white plastic bag was found in a wardrobe in an upstairs room.

18:12.232 --> 18:16.899
It contained 30 grams of cocaine with
a street value of around 2,000 Euro.

18:18.649 --> 18:20.982
Are there any aggregation factors I should know of?

18:21.399 --> 18:22.399
No, Judge.

18:26.066 --> 18:28.524
I'm not going to
finalize this today.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.774
To be remanded on continuing bail for a probation report.

18:32.024 --> 18:33.066
Thank you, Judge.

18:33.316 --> 18:34.399
Thank you, Judge.

18:35.566 --> 18:36.857
Okay, come.

18:52.649 --> 18:53.857
Do you want me to open it?

19:05.149 --> 19:06.482
Thursday.

19:09.524 --> 19:11.524
This one's at two o'clock.

19:13.357 --> 19:14.357
What does that mean?

19:17.316 --> 19:18.482
Am I going down?

19:29.607 --> 19:32.065
Okay everyone,
drop your essay in the box on the way out

19:32.149 --> 19:33.774
and don't forget to
put your name on it.

19:40.524 --> 19:42.565
Michael? Can I have a word?

19:44.190 --> 19:45.607
I heard about what happened.

19:46.357 --> 19:47.857
Is there anything
that we can do from here?

19:49.065 --> 19:50.274
No, I don't think so.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.649
You must be under
a lot of pressure.

19:54.732 --> 19:58.315
{\An3}-You said about Pearse College?
- Yeah, Social Care, wasn't it?

19:58.399 --> 20:00.482
- Yeah.
- Okay, yeah, would you be interested?

20:00.940 --> 20:02.107
Yeah.

20:02.190 --> 20:03.940
Right, I'll make that call
for you.

20:04.024 --> 20:05.607
- Thanks, miss.
- Okay.

20:40.857 --> 20:42.940
- How's it going, Michael?
- All right.

20:43.274 --> 20:44.399
Are you well?

21:07.107 --> 21:08.232
Michael?

21:11.982 --> 21:13.232
What are you doing up?

21:14.274 --> 21:15.399
Where were you?

21:15.899 --> 21:16.940
Out.

21:19.065 --> 21:20.107
How are you doing?

21:21.357 --> 21:22.524
Shite.

21:25.774 --> 21:27.982
I want you to visit
your da tomorrow.

21:28.357 --> 21:30.107
Ask him what he thinks.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.690
<i><font color=#ffffff>I'm still</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>in the Medical Unit.</font></i>

22:01.232 --> 22:03.482
You won't see me
if you come here.

22:04.357 --> 22:05.524
I know that.

22:08.649 --> 22:09.982
Why didn't you move it?

22:11.607 --> 22:12.774
I was going to.

22:15.274 --> 22:16.399
What do you want me to say?

22:17.357 --> 22:18.440
Nothing, Da.

22:23.732 --> 22:25.149
Stop thinking so much.

22:27.607 --> 22:28.607
I'm not.

22:34.399 --> 22:35.524
How's my da?

22:38.565 --> 22:39.565
Yeah, he's grand.

22:47.190 --> 22:48.607
You'll be all right.

22:56.565 --> 22:58.357
Pass the remote there,
will you?

22:58.899 --> 23:00.649
No, I'm watching this.

23:02.524 --> 23:05.232
- I'm away to bed then.
- Go then.

23:40.815 --> 23:41.857
I feel sick.

23:46.107 --> 23:47.649
Go back to bed.

23:49.274 --> 23:50.899
I won't be able for it.

23:51.732 --> 23:54.065
It won't be
as bad as you think.

23:54.815 --> 23:55.940
It will.

23:58.982 --> 24:01.107
You'll have to
toughen up, Michael.

24:04.107 --> 24:05.690
Just keep your head down.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.815
Don't piss anybody off
and you'll be okay.

24:10.899 --> 24:13.315
There's a lot of
normal people in there.

24:14.649 --> 24:15.940
You can do it.

24:16.982 --> 24:19.315
- I can't.
- You can.

24:23.899 --> 24:25.815
You're not a kid anymore.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.440
Go back to bed now.

24:54.232 --> 24:55.940
Don't say where you're from

24:56.274 --> 24:58.315
unless you know
who you're talking to.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.524
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

25:03.398 --> 25:04.523
Now, eat.

25:05.732 --> 25:06.982
I'm not hungry.

25:07.357 --> 25:08.732
Well, force yourself.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.440
Are you ready?

25:38.482 --> 25:39.565
Are you going to be all right?

25:40.273 --> 25:41.482
Yeah.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.940
The defendant is also
attending Youth Reach,

25:56.023 --> 25:58.440
currently finishing
a QQI Level Four

25:58.523 --> 26:00.190
in General Learning.

26:00.773 --> 26:02.232
He has expressed
a desire to attend

26:02.315 --> 26:03.857
a Further Education college.

26:04.982 --> 26:07.690
Judge, Michael is not
ordinarily involved

26:07.773 --> 26:08.857
in the drug trade.

26:08.940 --> 26:10.565
He was impulsive and naive

26:10.648 --> 26:12.232
and didn't think
through his actions.

26:12.690 --> 26:15.023
There are other
mitigating circumstances.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.648
There was a lack of
parental influence

26:16.732 --> 26:17.982
in Michael's life growing up.

26:18.565 --> 26:19.773
His mother died,

26:19.857 --> 26:21.940
and his father
is currently in prison.

26:22.398 --> 26:24.815
We ask for some leniency
in this instance

26:24.898 --> 26:27.315
to allow Michael
to further his education.

26:28.315 --> 26:30.023
Have you anything
to say, Mr. McCrea?

26:31.440 --> 26:32.523
Yes, Judge.

26:32.940 --> 26:35.065
I just want to say
I'm sorry for what I done

26:35.815 --> 26:37.815
and I promise
it won't happen again.

26:39.773 --> 26:43.732
You say impulsive and naive but this is not a first conviction.

26:43.815 --> 26:44.857
No, Your Honor.

26:44.940 --> 26:47.148
I see he was on probation bond
at the time of his offence

26:47.232 --> 26:49.940
with conditions that he does not offend in the next 12 months.

26:50.023 --> 26:52.732
His last conviction was
due to similar naivety.

26:52.815 --> 26:55.023
He was a passenger
in a stolen car.

26:55.190 --> 26:57.523
But Michael is
on a positive path now,

26:57.607 --> 26:59.273
and he has learned
his lesson this time.

26:59.773 --> 27:02.148
His grandfather is here
to support him today.

27:05.023 --> 27:07.273
This is a serious crime.

27:10.232 --> 27:14.815
Young man,
do you realize the consequences of the drug trade in our society?

27:18.398 --> 27:19.607
Yes, Judge.

27:20.690 --> 27:21.982
My mam

27:22.565 --> 27:25.232
died of a drug overdose
when I was really young.

27:29.357 --> 27:33.482
Michael McCrea, you were a minor,
but essential cog

27:33.857 --> 27:35.690
in a well-oiled machine.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.898
I have a duty to impose
a custodial sentence.

27:43.440 --> 27:47.482
It is the court's belief that you would benefit from a short,
sharp shock.

27:48.023 --> 27:51.107
Taking into account a plea of guilty at an early stage,

27:51.898 --> 27:54.773
I sentence you
to three months in custody.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.398
One month suspended.

28:01.648 --> 28:04.148
I hope you will learn
from this, Mr. McCrea

28:04.690 --> 28:06.732
and we don't see you
before the courts again.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.440
Michael.

28:44.232 --> 28:45.440
Just hang on there
a second.

28:45.940 --> 28:47.148
Any phone on you?

28:51.815 --> 28:52.815
He got nothing.

29:01.982 --> 29:04.273
All right, pal?
What's the story?

29:06.732 --> 29:07.982
What are you up for?

29:10.357 --> 29:12.107
Huh?

29:14.773 --> 29:15.857
Where are you from?

29:17.398 --> 29:18.898
I know your face
from somewhere.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.857
{\An3} Take responsibility for the crime,
make a sincere oath.

29:21.940 --> 29:23.232
You won't be in trouble
with the law again.

29:23.315 --> 29:24.357
Mr. McCrea?

29:25.148 --> 29:27.065
Give me a call
if you need anything, anytime.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.482
Hands out of your pockets,
okay?

29:58.982 --> 30:00.398
Where did you
get the chain, mate?

30:00.607 --> 30:01.732
I bought it a while back.

30:06.023 --> 30:07.982
Yeah, I'm surprised
they let you in with that.

30:11.190 --> 30:12.273
Leave him alone, lads.

30:12.357 --> 30:14.815
If anybody says anything,
I'm going in, I'm not getting out.

30:14.898 --> 30:17.690
So you'll see me inside.
If you see me inside, come over to me

30:17.982 --> 30:19.232
I'll look after you.

30:23.565 --> 30:25.898
Now, Michael, are you right?

30:26.190 --> 30:27.273
Let's go.

30:27.565 --> 30:29.273
Michael, listen to what I said
to you, do you hear me?

30:31.023 --> 30:32.482
He's not going to last long.

30:33.190 --> 30:34.315
I'll see him inside.

30:35.607 --> 30:36.815
He's going to get
bleedin' tore out of it.

30:36.898 --> 30:38.148
Hand over the chain.

30:40.231 --> 30:42.981
- What's the name?
- Michael McCrea.

30:45.315 --> 30:46.398
The address?

30:47.148 --> 30:49.481
15 Fortune Avenue,
St. Donnan Estate.

30:50.898 --> 30:52.648
Are you fighting with anyone?

30:53.106 --> 30:54.148
No.

30:55.606 --> 30:56.981
Do you need protection?

30:58.690 --> 30:59.856
No.

31:00.273 --> 31:01.523
Empty out the pockets.

31:08.315 --> 31:09.981
Just hang in there
for a second.

31:16.148 --> 31:17.481
Right, this way.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.273
Ever in jail before?

31:25.856 --> 31:27.690
- No.
- Never?

31:28.856 --> 31:30.231
You get used to it.

32:10.940 --> 32:11.981
McCrea?

32:25.731 --> 32:26.940
Stop there.

32:30.648 --> 32:31.731
Thanks.

32:32.690 --> 32:33.731
Come on.

32:36.356 --> 32:37.523
Stop.

32:42.523 --> 32:43.565
Step up.

32:47.190 --> 32:48.440
Show me your hands.

32:59.481 --> 33:00.815
Make some room, lads.

33:16.648 --> 33:17.940
Come on.

33:19.940 --> 33:21.606
Okay, have you anything
sharp in your pockets?

33:21.690 --> 33:23.648
{\An3}-No.
- I'm going to search you, okay?

33:23.731 --> 33:25.231
Okay, hold out your arms.

33:34.231 --> 33:37.273
Okay go over to that man there.
He needs to have a word with you.

33:41.273 --> 33:42.398
Are you all right?

33:43.731 --> 33:44.773
Scared?

33:46.190 --> 33:47.440
We'll keep an eye on you.

33:48.690 --> 33:49.940
Put your back
against the wall.

33:55.023 --> 33:56.190
Straight ahead.

33:59.731 --> 34:00.731
Good man.

34:01.231 --> 34:02.231
Come back to me.

34:02.981 --> 34:04.898

{\An8}Straight on.

37:28.648 --> 37:30.523
{\An8}You're going through
that gate there.

37:34.356 --> 37:37.689
Inmate 10287E,
Michael McCrea, sir.

37:44.689 --> 37:45.856
What are you looking at?

37:49.231 --> 37:50.273
Go on in.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.189
Take a seat.

38:01.064 --> 38:03.064
Now do you intend to
appeal your sentence?

38:03.981 --> 38:05.148
No, sir.

38:07.564 --> 38:08.606
Look at me.

38:09.981 --> 38:11.981
We're not going to have any trouble with you now,
are we?

38:13.189 --> 38:14.314
No, sir.

38:17.564 --> 38:19.439
Now take a good look at these.

38:21.523 --> 38:22.773
Do you know any of those men?

38:26.814 --> 38:27.814
I don't think so.

38:30.106 --> 38:31.648
What about
these fellas here?

38:34.189 --> 38:35.773
I know them to see.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.689
Probably not very happy
with you, are they?

38:41.981 --> 38:42.981
Well?

38:44.064 --> 38:45.814
Probably not, I don't know.

38:47.939 --> 38:49.273
You have any family in here?

38:50.648 --> 38:52.606
My da's in the Medical Unit.

38:53.689 --> 38:56.398
- Do you want to speak to a counselor?
- No.

38:57.606 --> 38:59.023
Who do you want
on your visitor list?

39:01.064 --> 39:02.439
Francis McCrea.

39:05.439 --> 39:06.814
Orla Kerr.

39:10.189 --> 39:11.273
Anyone else?

39:12.523 --> 39:13.731
Use words.

39:14.523 --> 39:15.564
No, sir.

39:36.606 --> 39:39.064
Some people stay
in holding for days.

39:39.481 --> 39:40.814
You're lucky,

39:47.439 --> 39:48.773
Wait here.

40:11.939 --> 40:13.189
What's your name?

40:14.814 --> 40:16.481
Michael.

40:39.398 --> 40:40.439
Hello, Francis.

40:42.606 --> 40:43.856
You want to put the kettle on?

40:44.189 --> 40:45.398
What do you want?

40:45.481 --> 40:46.814
Close that door.

40:58.648 --> 40:59.939
Let them in.

41:01.356 --> 41:02.648
Let them in!

41:21.689 --> 41:22.856
What do you want?

41:23.481 --> 41:26.314
What do you think I want?
That gear is owed me.

41:29.273 --> 41:30.481
He was only holding it.

41:32.314 --> 41:33.856
Yeah and then he lost it.

41:34.606 --> 41:36.189
Well, it wasn't his fault.

41:37.356 --> 41:38.481
Look...

41:38.981 --> 41:41.981
I'm not getting bleedin' shot
for you or your grandson.

41:42.606 --> 41:43.647
You're out of options here.

41:44.231 --> 41:46.272
You don't not pay.

41:51.064 --> 41:52.439
It's not his debt.

41:55.022 --> 41:56.106
Then whose is it?

41:56.856 --> 41:58.397
Whoever he was holding it for.

42:01.397 --> 42:02.647
Look,

42:03.606 --> 42:05.231
{\an3}he was told to move that stuff.

42:05.981 --> 42:07.272
He didn't move it.

42:08.189 --> 42:10.481
So explain to me
how it's not his fault?

42:12.897 --> 42:14.314
I'm not paying you anything.

42:15.606 --> 42:17.606
Take your mates
and get out of my home.

42:20.856 --> 42:22.147
There's fuck all here.

42:26.814 --> 42:28.314
Do you want a warning?

42:30.606 --> 42:31.606
No.

42:31.814 --> 42:32.939
No.

42:33.022 --> 42:34.106
- No.
- No.

42:36.022 --> 42:37.064
That's it?

42:37.147 --> 42:38.939
I'll pay. I'll pay.

42:39.564 --> 42:41.397
I'm going to be here
Friday morning.

42:42.189 --> 42:43.814
I want two grand off you.

42:44.856 --> 42:45.897
Do you hear me?

42:47.606 --> 42:48.606
Do you?

42:49.022 --> 42:50.022
I hear.

42:51.189 --> 42:53.106
Good, tell me you're
going to have it.

42:53.897 --> 42:54.981
I'll have it.

42:55.606 --> 42:57.147
Tell me how you're
going to get it?

42:59.689 --> 43:01.897
- I'll borrow it.
- From who?

43:03.147 --> 43:04.481
I don't know yet.

43:12.731 --> 43:14.522
If you try and disappear,

43:17.064 --> 43:19.314
- I'm going to take it out of Michael inside.
- I won't.

43:27.356 --> 43:30.106
Come on, let's go.

44:15.939 --> 44:17.147
Inmate at the gate.

45:02.522 --> 45:04.522
- Where you from, pal?
- What?

45:04.606 --> 45:06.731
- Where you from?
- Dublin.

45:07.147 --> 45:08.397
Are you being smart?

45:09.814 --> 45:11.856
- Are you?
- No.

45:11.939 --> 45:13.939
- Where you from?
- Dublin.

45:15.356 --> 45:16.772
Do you know
what you just did?

45:19.272 --> 45:20.731
Do you remember me?

45:21.856 --> 45:22.856
Huh?

45:22.939 --> 45:24.064
I don't know you.

45:24.147 --> 45:26.731
That's not what I said.
Do you recognize me?

45:29.647 --> 45:31.606
- Do you hear me, are you deaf?
- I heard you.

45:33.522 --> 45:36.231
- What's your problem?
- There's no problem.

45:37.022 --> 45:38.481
Where are you from?
It's a simple question.

45:39.022 --> 45:40.939
I told you.

45:42.397 --> 45:44.106
- Do you want to get your throat slit?
- No.

45:44.647 --> 45:45.772
- Do you?
- No.

45:47.147 --> 45:49.189
- Then why are you being smart?
- I'm not.

45:49.272 --> 45:50.439
Look at me.

45:51.731 --> 45:53.814
- Say you're sorry.
- I'm sorry.

45:55.272 --> 45:56.397
Too late, cunt.

46:16.439 --> 46:18.064
Do you know anyone
in here?

46:19.106 --> 46:21.481
- Yeah.
- Who?

46:23.481 --> 46:24.772
No one?

46:26.481 --> 46:27.606
A few people.

46:31.231 --> 46:33.272
If you don't know anyone,
you're fucked.

46:50.397 --> 46:53.897
All right, Francis?
- I'd like to take it all out please, Sandra.

46:55.856 --> 46:57.189
You can't pay them.

46:58.231 --> 47:00.147
Well, tell me what to do then?

47:02.106 --> 47:04.272
You know they'll just
keep coming back.

47:06.814 --> 47:09.772
The only thing I can do is
be firm, hold my ground.

47:10.772 --> 47:12.272
Tell them I've no more money.

47:12.939 --> 47:14.981
But they don't care
where you get the money.

47:16.189 --> 47:18.939
Hope they'll move on to some other poor unfortunate.

47:34.022 --> 47:35.772
There's a 125 there.

47:39.647 --> 47:41.022
Thanks, Des.

47:41.855 --> 47:43.397
I'll get it back to you.

47:45.855 --> 47:47.314
You know what I'm
going to ask next.

47:49.522 --> 47:51.064
"Any drink in here?"

47:53.730 --> 47:55.022
I'm only joking.

48:41.230 --> 48:42.230
Hello?

48:51.439 --> 48:53.105
Keep him there, yeah?

48:53.355 --> 48:54.480
Check his pockets.

48:55.480 --> 48:56.814
What has he got?

48:56.980 --> 48:58.605
- What has he got?
- Let go of me.

49:00.064 --> 49:01.605
Fuck all.

49:01.689 --> 49:02.939
Oh, here you go.

49:10.689 --> 49:11.772
Come on.

49:31.189 --> 49:33.105
I want that remote back.

49:34.355 --> 49:36.022
You have to stand up
to that prick.

49:37.605 --> 49:38.772
Will you help me?

49:40.897 --> 49:42.439
You have to do it yourself.

49:46.397 --> 49:48.605
If I get another charge,
I lose my kids.

49:49.189 --> 49:50.397
Yeah?

49:51.314 --> 49:52.939
She said she'd leave me, yeah?

49:54.105 --> 49:55.564
Just keep me well out of it.

49:59.605 --> 50:01.189
Why are you in here?

50:03.105 --> 50:05.147
I was in a scrap
on Leeson Street.

50:06.772 --> 50:08.022
Was it bad?

50:10.230 --> 50:11.439
Yeah.

50:12.022 --> 50:13.230
I've a problem with anger.

50:22.439 --> 50:24.022
Who beat you up?

50:30.230 --> 50:32.147
{\An3}-More than one?
- I don't want to talk about it.

50:32.230 --> 50:33.439
How many?

50:35.272 --> 50:36.355
One.

50:38.397 --> 50:40.022
And a few of his mates.

50:43.730 --> 50:45.772
You have to stand up
for yourself in here.

50:48.314 --> 50:49.564
You won't be here long.

50:53.105 --> 50:54.355
I can't do it.

50:55.314 --> 50:56.522
What does that mean?

50:58.189 --> 51:01.105
- I won't make it.
- You will make it.

51:02.939 --> 51:04.147
Do you hear me?

51:11.064 --> 51:12.730
What was that course
in Pearse College?

51:14.397 --> 51:15.480
Social Care.

51:16.730 --> 51:17.897
Wait...

51:18.814 --> 51:20.647
Think about when you get out.

51:25.439 --> 51:27.480
You've got to fight back
in here, Michael.

51:28.439 --> 51:29.605
Look at me.

51:30.855 --> 51:32.189
Do you hear me?

52:01.272 --> 52:02.355
McCrea?

52:04.689 --> 52:06.105
You have to attack
that fella.

52:06.980 --> 52:08.022
What?

52:08.730 --> 52:10.064
You have to attack him.

52:15.939 --> 52:17.980
- It's none of your business.
- He'll be back in to you then.

52:18.730 --> 52:20.689
Again and again
and more people will.

52:21.855 --> 52:23.564
Come on, he's in his cell now.

52:24.230 --> 52:25.522
- No.
- No?

52:26.855 --> 52:27.939
All right.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.605
I wait outside
the door, you follow.

52:31.022 --> 52:32.730
I'm not asking, how's that?

52:34.105 --> 52:35.189
What do you mean?

52:35.689 --> 52:39.189
If I don't move off,
that means he's in there on his own.

52:41.272 --> 52:42.772
Do you understand?

52:44.980 --> 52:46.189
Why are you doing this?

52:47.855 --> 52:49.064
For your own good.

53:02.063 --> 53:03.147
Do it.

53:03.980 --> 53:05.230
Fucking do it.

53:05.563 --> 53:06.772
Do it.

53:13.605 --> 53:14.772
Do it.

53:32.522 --> 53:33.647
Leave him alone.

53:35.022 --> 53:36.980
Where's your fucking mates now?
- Let's go.

53:37.063 --> 53:38.063
Go.

53:38.855 --> 53:40.480
Back to your cell, man.
Quick.

54:35.063 --> 54:36.480
Hello, Francis.

54:42.105 --> 54:43.772
{\An3}What are you watching, "Darts?"

54:49.105 --> 54:50.605
What are you, pissed?

54:51.647 --> 54:52.855
I don't drink.

54:53.438 --> 54:54.522
Since when?

54:54.605 --> 54:55.730
Nineteen years.

54:58.480 --> 54:59.480
Do you like "Darts"?

54:59.980 --> 55:01.313
I want to make
something clear.

55:01.730 --> 55:02.772
Who's he?

55:02.855 --> 55:04.688
I want to make
something very clear.

55:05.063 --> 55:07.313
- Well, hurry up.
- I'm paying the debt.

55:07.688 --> 55:10.980
- Yeah, I know.
- Because of what Michael got messed up in.

55:12.313 --> 55:14.105
But I'm not paying you thugs
another penny.

55:14.563 --> 55:15.563
Are you not?

55:16.063 --> 55:17.230
You can kill me.

55:18.105 --> 55:20.188
But you're not getting
nothing more from me.

55:24.647 --> 55:26.522
Don't worry about it,
no one's killing anyone.

55:33.688 --> 55:35.522
- Yes.
- That's me cleaned out.

55:40.188 --> 55:41.772
Tony.

55:49.522 --> 55:51.230
Don't be worrying about it,
old man.

55:52.980 --> 55:54.147
The debt's paid now.

56:01.480 --> 56:02.647
See you later.

56:41.563 --> 56:42.563
Open your hand.

56:43.313 --> 56:45.730
- What?
- Open your hand.

56:48.438 --> 56:49.522
Put it away.

56:50.188 --> 56:51.313
Put it away.

56:51.772 --> 56:54.105
- I don't want that.
- Hold it until I want it.

56:55.147 --> 56:56.855
'Cause we help each other
in here.

56:56.938 --> 56:58.563
Don't call anyone with that.

57:06.563 --> 57:09.063
The case
got a strike out anyway.

57:09.147 --> 57:11.022
The fuckin' copper
never turned up.

57:14.230 --> 57:15.605
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

57:17.522 --> 57:19.855
The shopkeeper's family
and all were there.

57:21.397 --> 57:23.397
- That's mad.
- Mmm.

57:28.063 --> 57:29.147
Do what I say, yeah?

57:29.647 --> 57:30.897
Yeah.

57:42.022 --> 57:43.230
Stay.

57:43.313 --> 57:44.897
Sit down, sit down.

57:45.522 --> 57:47.563
Michael, this is Steve.

57:52.022 --> 57:54.063
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

57:54.438 --> 57:55.647
I saw your brother.

57:56.605 --> 57:57.605
With his bird, was it?

57:58.313 --> 57:59.772
No, my ma.

58:03.980 --> 58:05.480
Did they leave my money?

58:07.438 --> 58:10.022
Dave, you know,
you said I could give that to you next week.

58:10.105 --> 58:11.188
Sit down.

58:12.522 --> 58:14.730
- Sit the fuck down.
- What are you doing?

58:16.688 --> 58:19.772
So you knew they were coming,
and you didn't tell them, hmm?

58:22.397 --> 58:23.480
Hmm?

58:23.563 --> 58:26.230
- Sorry, I didn't think--
- Look at me. You didn't think.

58:27.063 --> 58:28.063
You didn't fuckin' think.

58:28.688 --> 58:29.896
Steve.

58:29.980 --> 58:31.021
Steven.

58:34.771 --> 58:36.355
Look at me.

58:37.396 --> 58:38.813
Do you think
I'm a fuckin' mug?

58:39.396 --> 58:40.938
No.

58:44.813 --> 58:45.980
Michael, come here.

58:46.105 --> 58:47.563
No, no.
Michael, please.

58:47.646 --> 58:48.938
No, you don't have
to do this, lads.

58:49.021 --> 58:52.355
You don't want to do this.
Don't! Please, don't do this.

58:52.771 --> 58:54.605
What are you doing?

58:54.688 --> 58:58.855
No! Please!
Please, no! Please! No!

58:58.938 --> 59:00.855
Please! No...

59:31.438 --> 59:32.771
Are we quits now?

59:42.063 --> 59:46.188
Ask me again and I'll stamp your face into the concrete.

59:56.313 --> 59:57.896
Open your hand.

01:00:02.313 --> 01:00:03.521
Hold it.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.771
I first went into prison
when I was 13.

01:00:54.688 --> 01:00:56.980
I've been inside
most of my life.

01:00:59.105 --> 01:01:01.355
I got out for the last time
in 2007

01:01:02.105 --> 01:01:03.480
an angry man.

01:01:05.188 --> 01:01:07.521
I think
everyone comes out bitter

01:01:07.605 --> 01:01:08.980
no matter what they tell you.

01:01:10.438 --> 01:01:12.771
The longer the stretch,
the bigger the scar.

01:01:14.146 --> 01:01:16.563
I still feel anger
when I see a uniform.

01:01:17.355 --> 01:01:19.146
I don't think that'll change.

01:01:22.355 --> 01:01:25.313
The reason they asked me
to do this is

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:29.271
I've finished a Masters now
in Criminology

01:01:29.605 --> 01:01:31.438
and I'm applying
for a Doctorate.

01:01:34.521 --> 01:01:37.063
When I say that out loud,
it doesn't sound like me.

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:43.605
The last time I came out,

01:01:44.396 --> 01:01:46.105
I done nine year
for armed robbery.

01:01:47.188 --> 01:01:48.355
They said to me,

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:51.730
"Sam, all you need to
change now is everything."

01:01:54.146 --> 01:01:55.813
They were talking
about my addiction.

01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:59.021
Which started during
my first sentence

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.896
and that led to all
my other convictions.

01:02:04.146 --> 01:02:06.271
A lot of people
don't understand

01:02:07.271 --> 01:02:10.230
that when everyone around you
is doing gear

01:02:11.521 --> 01:02:13.855
and your self-worth
is rock bottom,

01:02:15.313 --> 01:02:17.105
it can make sense inside.

01:02:18.896 --> 01:02:21.688
For me,
it was relief from the pain of being a prisoner.

01:02:22.855 --> 01:02:24.396
Like a day out.

01:02:26.771 --> 01:02:27.980
But as most of you know,

01:02:28.396 --> 01:02:30.396
the pain is much worse
when you have a drug habit.

01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:38.188
For me and my family,
heroin meant a road to complete hell.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.605
I'd get clean
and then relapse.

01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:45.813
Get clean again, relapse.

01:02:49.146 --> 01:02:51.646
And then I got clean
for my grand-daughter

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:52.813
Kelly's communion.

01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:58.063
I did it for her.

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.438
And I'm not going back.

01:03:08.605 --> 01:03:11.938
Eileen, down the community
center is my guardian angel.

01:03:13.188 --> 01:03:15.521
She got me onto an
Open University course.

01:03:16.105 --> 01:03:17.230
I flew through it.

01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:20.938
At 45, I realized
I was intelligent.

01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:27.063
In college, good things
started to happen.

01:03:27.771 --> 01:03:30.896
The more I achieved,
the more I wanted to continue.

01:03:31.771 --> 01:03:33.313
And I could see that the first half of my life

01:03:33.396 --> 01:03:34.730
had been such a waste.

01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:41.146
I hope you've taken
something from this.

01:03:42.813 --> 01:03:45.563
I want to thank you for
letting me tell my story.

01:03:47.271 --> 01:03:48.813
I'll take any questions.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.605
Maybe we can get
a bit of a conversation going.

01:03:57.146 --> 01:03:58.396
<i><font color=#ffffff>Explain the point</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>of college?</font></i>

01:03:58.479 --> 01:03:59.688
<i><font color=#ffffff>To get a decent job?</font></i>

01:04:00.021 --> 01:04:02.188
You'll always have to
tick that box, Michael.

01:04:02.646 --> 01:04:03.938
And if they've to pick
between you

01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:05.438
and someone
without a conviction,

01:04:05.521 --> 01:04:07.021
who are they going to pick?

01:04:09.771 --> 01:04:11.479
Forget about buying a house.

01:04:12.521 --> 01:04:14.646
Forget about
going to the States.

01:04:15.938 --> 01:04:18.729
- For how long?
- For life, pal.

01:04:22.688 --> 01:04:25.688
- Why?
- Why? Why do you think?

01:04:27.021 --> 01:04:28.479
To keep us down.

01:04:29.688 --> 01:04:31.979
You're fucked out there now
if you want to live straight.

01:04:32.438 --> 01:04:36.188
Your sentence only starts when you're released,
just watch.

01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:39.563
<i><font color=#ffffff>Do you have kids?</font></i>

01:04:51.896 --> 01:04:53.229
I've a son in Wales.

01:04:54.521 --> 01:04:55.771
Yeah?

01:04:58.979 --> 01:05:00.271
Bobby.

01:05:04.229 --> 01:05:05.646
He's 12.

01:05:07.646 --> 01:05:08.854
Bobby.

01:05:11.313 --> 01:05:12.646
Does he visit?

01:05:15.396 --> 01:05:16.854
He's in Wales.

01:05:20.063 --> 01:05:21.646
Is that where his ma lives?

01:05:25.771 --> 01:05:26.938
No.

01:05:37.354 --> 01:05:38.563
No.

01:05:44.438 --> 01:05:45.688
Open your hand.

01:05:48.313 --> 01:05:50.104
Put the fuckin' thing away.

01:05:50.188 --> 01:05:52.646
- Slash his face.
- What?

01:05:53.104 --> 01:05:55.063
Not a bleedin' scratch, deep.

01:05:56.396 --> 01:05:57.938
On my own?

01:07:07.188 --> 01:07:09.063
<i><font color=#ffffff>I'm sick.</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>I don't give a fuck.</font></i>

01:07:10.438 --> 01:07:12.688
I'm after throwing up,
and I've a fucking headache.

01:07:13.313 --> 01:07:14.604
Do it.

01:07:16.813 --> 01:07:18.188
I can't.

01:07:19.854 --> 01:07:21.354
I'm not cut out for it.

01:07:24.271 --> 01:07:26.938
The next time you try
and fuck up my system,

01:07:27.646 --> 01:07:29.021
you think of Francis.

01:08:08.896 --> 01:08:09.938
Oi?

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.645
McCrea?

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.770
Governor wants to see you.

01:08:57.563 --> 01:08:59.104
- For what?
- Now!

01:09:22.979 --> 01:09:24.479
Do you know
what he wants me for?

01:09:25.438 --> 01:09:27.354
Have you been doing anything
you're not supposed to?

01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:29.395
No.

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.895
Then you've nothing to
worry about, have you?

01:09:38.812 --> 01:09:40.479
Were you involved
in that yesterday?

01:09:41.395 --> 01:09:42.395
No.

01:09:55.146 --> 01:09:58.479
Inmate 10287E
Michael McCrea, sir.

01:09:59.104 --> 01:10:00.437
Yes, sir.

01:10:11.937 --> 01:10:14.604
Right, send him in.
In you go.

01:10:19.979 --> 01:10:20.979
Sit.

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:36.437
You're being released.
You'll be outside at midday tomorrow.

01:10:38.687 --> 01:10:39.896
Thanks.

01:10:41.187 --> 01:10:43.562
- Do you have anywhere to live?
- Yeah.

01:10:46.396 --> 01:10:49.854
You'll be given details of your post-release program later on.

01:10:50.979 --> 01:10:52.229
Before you leave.

01:10:54.062 --> 01:10:56.396
- Thanks, sir
- Right, that's all.

01:11:03.062 --> 01:11:04.021
Grandad?

01:11:04.646 --> 01:11:07.562
- I'm getting out.
- <i><font color=#ffffff>Thank God.</font></i>

01:11:07.646 --> 01:11:08.937
I'll be outside
at 12:00 tomorrow.

01:11:09.687 --> 01:11:10.771
I'll be there.

01:11:11.562 --> 01:11:13.104
<i><font color=#ffffff>No you don't have to,</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>don't be worrying.</font></i>

01:11:13.187 --> 01:11:14.229
<i><font color=#ffffff>I'll see you at home.</font></i>

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:15.687
I'll be there.

01:11:19.396 --> 01:11:20.979
<i><font color=#ffffff>Grandad, I just...</font></i>

01:11:22.854 --> 01:11:25.479
<i><font color=#ffffff>I'm sorry about everything.</font></i>

01:11:25.562 --> 01:11:27.021
It's over now, Michael.

01:11:29.021 --> 01:11:30.479
<i><font color=#ffffff>Look, I've to go back</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>now, yeah?</font></i>

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:33.021
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:11:33.979 --> 01:11:35.104
<i><font color=#ffffff>I'll see you.</font></i>

01:11:51.604 --> 01:11:53.187
- Guess what?
- Guess what?

01:11:53.271 --> 01:11:54.687
What the fuck is this?

01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:58.187
I couldn't say no.

01:11:58.812 --> 01:12:00.896
- You trying to get me more charges, is it?
- No.

01:12:00.979 --> 01:12:03.771
- I can't get any more time, you know that.
- I know.

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:06.771
- You trying to ruin my life?
- No, Ray.

01:12:08.604 --> 01:12:09.812
What else is there?

01:12:10.979 --> 01:12:12.021
Just a phone.

01:12:12.104 --> 01:12:13.687
Just a phone...
Then get it.

01:12:22.687 --> 01:12:24.146
Are you fucking for real?

01:12:26.146 --> 01:12:28.021
Just give it back to him,
all of it, yeah?

01:12:29.437 --> 01:12:30.437
I can't.

01:12:31.521 --> 01:12:32.896
What do you mean you can't?

01:12:34.312 --> 01:12:35.604
Now!

01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:38.937
Don't push me, Michael.

01:13:00.521 --> 01:13:01.854
I'm getting out.

01:13:05.187 --> 01:13:06.479
Tomorrow.

01:13:10.104 --> 01:13:11.562
Sorry I fucked up.

01:13:16.562 --> 01:13:17.729
I have your stuff.

01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:26.729
Give it.

01:13:34.729 --> 01:13:35.729
Michael.

01:13:38.771 --> 01:13:39.812
Sit down.

01:14:14.812 --> 01:14:17.312
Don't let anyone fuck
with you out there, okay?

01:14:20.604 --> 01:14:22.229
Good lad, go.

01:14:23.729 --> 01:14:24.812
Go.

01:14:53.312 --> 01:14:55.396
<i><font color=#ffffff>We're not going to see you back in here again, Michael,</font></i>

<i><font color=#ffffff>Yeah.</font></i>

01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:16.770
<i><font color=#ffffff>Good.</font></i>

01:15:16.854 --> 01:15:18.479
McCrea, get ready.

<i><font color=#ffffff>Your probation officer's</font></i>

01:15:30.062 --> 01:15:31.937
- Cheers, Ray.
- Take it easy, Michael.

01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:41.687
Don't go acting the big man
when you get out.

01:15:42.354 --> 01:15:43.604
I won't.

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.479
- Good luck.
- Cheers.

01:15:50.354 --> 01:15:52.354
- Good luck, Michael.
- Cheers.

<i><font color=#ffffff>Just tell me again now what he needs to bring with him.</font></i>

A CV

01:16:26.562 --> 01:16:30.229
and two references.

01:16:31.562 --> 01:16:33.437
Um... Now you...

01:16:34.645 --> 01:16:39.020
Tell me,
would a character reference be all right?

01:16:41.937 --> 01:16:45.020
- Michael, what's the story?
- All right?

01:16:45.104 --> 01:16:46.854
- When did you get out?
- Just today.

01:16:46.937 --> 01:16:48.770
- Why didn't you ring me?
- Just out.

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:50.187
- You are, are you?
- Yeah.

01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:51.770
- Dog rough, was it?
- Yeah.

01:16:52.062 --> 01:16:53.354
- If you say so.
- Rough.

01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:09.645
Michael? Michael?

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.687

01:17:20.854 --> 01:17:22.270
Yeah, they fucking are scum.

01:17:24.312 --> 01:17:26.104
Do you think they'll have
more people than us?

01:17:26.187 --> 01:17:28.937
No way,
we have a bigger estate.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.770
Count me out, lads, yeah?

01:17:31.437 --> 01:17:32.645
Suit yourself.

01:17:33.604 --> 01:17:35.770
The bleedin' cops are
watching Facebook, you thick.

01:17:36.645 --> 01:17:37.645
Well, get off it.

01:17:41.187 --> 01:17:42.187
Oi!

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:44.645
Are you involved
in these fights?

01:17:45.187 --> 01:17:46.187
No.

01:17:46.479 --> 01:17:48.770
- Do you know there's a curfew?
- I'm 18.

01:17:49.104 --> 01:17:51.395
- Are you being smart?
- No.

01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:53.479
Do you want me to get
out of this car?

01:17:53.562 --> 01:17:54.562
No.

01:17:58.437 --> 01:17:59.479
Empty your pockets.

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:04.895
The other ones.

01:18:10.604 --> 01:18:12.479
- Where are you going?
- Home.

01:18:13.687 --> 01:18:15.812
- Well, hurry up then.
- Yes, Guard.

01:18:33.645 --> 01:18:34.645
All right, Grandad?

01:18:35.479 --> 01:18:37.687
Thought I'd do
some decent food.

01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:38.770
Lovely.

01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:40.312

Yeah.

01:18:43.187 --> 01:18:44.187
Well, just...

01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:46.479
Just be yourself.

01:18:47.312 --> 01:18:48.770
Are you sure about that?

01:19:08.854 --> 01:19:10.979
<i><font color=#ffffff>Could you tell us</font></i>

<i><font color=#ffffff>That's okay, Michael.</font></i>

01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:28.020
<i><font color=#ffffff>Why are you interested</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>in Social Care?</font></i>

01:19:29.604 --> 01:19:32.770
Uh... My teacher said
it would suit me?

01:19:33.604 --> 01:19:34.645
Okay.

01:19:36.062 --> 01:19:39.062
- I work well with people.
- Right.

01:19:41.145 --> 01:19:42.770
I'm trying to better myself.

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:46.229
Okay. And have you
read the prospectus?

01:19:47.187 --> 01:19:48.729
No, sorry.

01:19:50.187 --> 01:19:52.395
- But I will.
- That's fine.

01:19:56.145 --> 01:20:00.020
I want to use what happened to me as a positive,
to help others.

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:02.312
I think I'd be good
at stuff like that.

01:20:03.312 --> 01:20:05.479
Okay, do you have
your references with you?

01:20:05.562 --> 01:20:07.020
Yeah, right here.

01:20:18.354 --> 01:20:20.604
- Francis McCrea?
- My grandad.

01:20:22.062 --> 01:20:24.729
We need employment or
educational references.

01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:28.145
They said I could choose
a character one?

01:20:28.812 --> 01:20:31.979
I'm waiting on my school one,
and one of them is from Youth Reach.

01:20:53.228 --> 01:20:54.895
All right, Michael.
All right?

01:20:55.145 --> 01:20:56.978
Are you just out?
Yeah, man.

01:20:57.062 --> 01:20:58.645
Well, Henry's da
is in there now.

01:20:58.728 --> 01:20:59.728
For what?

01:20:59.812 --> 01:21:02.270
For driving in the bus lane.
Is he actually?

01:21:02.353 --> 01:21:04.603
Yeah, he is.
Ah, that's stupid.

01:21:04.687 --> 01:21:05.770
I know, isn't it?

01:21:06.312 --> 01:21:07.812
What were you in there for?

01:21:08.562 --> 01:21:10.562
Holding drugs for a mate
Eh.

01:21:11.312 --> 01:21:13.937
See, that's what happens when you get in with the wrong crowd,
isn't it?

01:21:15.312 --> 01:21:16.687
I brought it in
last week.

01:21:17.603 --> 01:21:19.645
That letter only entitles you
one weeks' payment.

01:21:19.728 --> 01:21:21.937
So you need to sign on
to the live register now.

01:21:22.603 --> 01:21:23.937
Well, sign me on, then.

01:21:24.978 --> 01:21:26.520
You need to
give me an address.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.520
Love,
I'm only out a week.

01:21:30.103 --> 01:21:31.687
I'm sorry, Mr. Moore.

01:21:32.228 --> 01:21:33.645
I'm between places.

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.353
I need an address.

01:21:35.937 --> 01:21:39.270
Now in the meantime,
you can go down to your local community welfare officer.

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:42.437
They will sort you out with
one weeks' emergency payment.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:45.687
Or you can go down to the homeless unit on Parkgate Street.

01:21:46.562 --> 01:21:48.478
Why don't you people
give me an address?

01:21:50.187 --> 01:21:53.603
Will you come back to us when you have
everything required to sign on, please?

01:21:53.687 --> 01:21:55.895
{\An3}-What am I supposed to live on?
- Thank you.

01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:58.937
{\An3}Are you trying to send me back?

01:22:03.895 --> 01:22:05.478
This is a fucking joke.

01:22:11.937 --> 01:22:14.937
Nothing's gonna happen.

01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:20.437
Tony.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:23.687
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:22:28.145 --> 01:22:29.145
Hello, Michael.

01:22:30.478 --> 01:22:31.603
Take a seat.

01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:36.978
Must be good to be out, right?

01:22:38.103 --> 01:22:39.228
What do you want?

01:22:40.728 --> 01:22:41.812
Tell him.

01:22:43.103 --> 01:22:44.687
I didn't agree to anything.

01:22:46.812 --> 01:22:48.270
Just fucking tell him.

01:22:49.687 --> 01:22:53.020
They want me to take drugs into the prison when I'm visiting Christy.

01:22:55.187 --> 01:22:57.812
- Christy's agreed.
- I doubt that.

01:22:58.270 --> 01:23:00.145
Well, you know, agreed.

01:23:00.687 --> 01:23:01.895
Didn't have a choice.

01:23:02.353 --> 01:23:03.562
Much like you.

01:23:06.187 --> 01:23:08.062
Whatever you lost,
I'll pay for it.

01:23:09.895 --> 01:23:11.270
Bill's already been paid.

01:23:13.187 --> 01:23:14.645
Did he not tell you?

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.728
You paid them?

01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:19.395
What else could I do?

01:23:21.687 --> 01:23:23.187
What else could he do?

01:23:24.603 --> 01:23:25.895
So, are you gonna do it?

01:23:29.728 --> 01:23:31.520
I know guys you don't
want to fuck with.

01:23:33.312 --> 01:23:35.728
- Locked up?
- He's not doing it.

01:23:50.562 --> 01:23:52.520
If he doesn't do what I say,

01:23:53.478 --> 01:23:55.187
I'm going to take your da.

01:23:56.437 --> 01:23:57.978
You'll never see him again.

01:24:07.645 --> 01:24:10.687
You're not doing this.
- What choice do I have?

01:24:11.812 --> 01:24:13.353
Why did you pay them?

01:24:17.187 --> 01:24:18.937
I want you to go up North.

01:24:21.895 --> 01:24:24.728
- You're not doing this.
- Will you go to your nan?

01:24:25.937 --> 01:24:27.645
This isn't right, Grandad.

01:24:30.437 --> 01:24:31.645
It's not right.

01:24:34.853 --> 01:24:36.853
- It's not right, Grandad.
- Calm down.

01:24:54.353 --> 01:24:56.062
How did the interview go?

01:24:58.395 --> 01:24:59.478
Fuck the interview.

01:25:00.145 --> 01:25:01.145
Where are you going?

01:25:01.228 --> 01:25:02.353
Fuck this place.

01:25:02.437 --> 01:25:04.145
Michael. Michael!

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.436
Oi.

01:27:18.811 --> 01:27:19.853
What are you doing?

01:27:25.853 --> 01:27:27.186
Go near my grandad again,

01:27:27.645 --> 01:27:29.020
I'll be fucking back.

01:27:49.645 --> 01:27:51.686
- Michael?
- Yeah.

01:27:56.228 --> 01:27:57.270
Are you okay?

01:27:58.811 --> 01:27:59.853
Yeah.

01:29:11.936 --> 01:29:14.103
<i><font color=#ffffff>This was a vicious</font></i>
<i><font color=#ffffff>and brutal attack.</font></i>

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:18.561
Michael McCrea,
you are sentenced to three years in custody.

01:29:50.603 --> 01:29:52.270
Have you ever been
to prison before?

01:29:53.436 --> 01:29:54.520
Yeah.

01:29:54.603 --> 01:29:57.478
Are you involved in any feuds
at the moment, Mr. McCrea?

01:29:58.728 --> 01:29:59.728
Yeah.

01:30:00.811 --> 01:30:01.978
With who?

01:30:15.853 --> 01:30:17.603
You don't want to
fuck this up, Francis.

01:30:34.978 --> 01:30:36.728
You're going
through that gate there.
