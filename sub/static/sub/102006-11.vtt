09:05.745 --> 09:07.380
I'm just gonna drive her away.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.115
Athena, you are not Beatrice.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.784
You're not your mother.

09:10.850 --> 09:15.121
In that moment,
it felt like I was.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.525
<i>BUCK:</i>
<i>Hey, so,</i>

09:18.591 --> 09:21.194
what do you know
about the 911 call center?

09:21.261 --> 09:23.997
(chuckles):
Uh, next to nothing.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.665
Your sister works there, right?

09:25.732 --> 09:29.436
Yeah, she does. Uh, her boss,
Sue, is really great.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.505
She's actually been at
the call center since it opened.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.807
‐Since the '60s?
‐No.

09:33.873 --> 09:36.509
That's‐that's when they created
the number. Call center

09:36.576 --> 09:39.112
here in L. A. didn't open
till 1984.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.547
And did you know dispatchers

09:40.613 --> 09:42.749
aren't even classified
as first responders

09:42.816 --> 09:44.818
in most parts of the country?

09:44.884 --> 09:45.819
Which is crazy.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.488
Uh, only changed
here in California last year.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.057
Interesting.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.030
‐Yeah?
‐Hey. So, um, the other night,

09:57.097 --> 09:59.265
Sue was hit by a car.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.501
Uh, driver just took off.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.103
That's awful.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.537
Did you know

10:04.604 --> 10:08.007
less than ten percent
of hit‐and‐runs ever get solved?

10:08.074 --> 10:09.476
Yes, though it doesn't feel

10:09.542 --> 10:12.445
like you're just citing
another interesting fact now.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.415
So, police have no leads.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.016
I checked.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.451
And I figured maybe the public

10:18.518 --> 10:20.920
could help, but the public
would need to know

10:20.987 --> 10:22.755
about the hit‐and‐run.

10:22.822 --> 10:23.923
Oh.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.326
Maybe if they saw it
on the news?

10:26.392 --> 10:29.662
It just so happens
I have, uh, a friend

10:29.729 --> 10:32.465
‐who's also
a fantastic reporter.
‐(chuckles)

10:32.532 --> 10:37.003
And I‐I thought
maybe she could do me a favor.

10:37.670 --> 10:40.406
If I'm gonna sell this
to my assignment editor,

10:40.473 --> 10:44.077
I'm gonna need a better hook
than just a hit‐and‐run.

10:44.144 --> 10:48.014
Okay. Uh, like what?

10:48.648 --> 10:51.251
Tell me more
about the call center.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.489
<i>JOSH:</i>
<i>Sue took a pretty bad hit.</i>

10:56.556 --> 10:59.893
A concussion, plus some
pretty severe internal injuries.

10:59.959 --> 11:05.298
But she's out of surgery,
and Don says she did well.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.567
God. I think I took that call.
I didn't know.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.269
JOSH:
There's no way for you to know.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.704
Woman who called it in
never said Sue's name.

11:11.771 --> 11:14.474
‐What about the guy who hit her?
‐Police are still looking.

11:14.541 --> 11:18.912
I'm... I'm not sure
what else we...

11:18.978 --> 11:21.147
Uh, if people need someone
to talk to?

11:21.214 --> 11:24.918
Yes. Counselors are available
if anyone needs to talk.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.920
And I'm here
if you need anything.

11:26.986 --> 11:31.691
I'll update you as I get more
information, but until then...

11:33.426 --> 11:35.795
Just keep Sue in your thoughts.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.601
Okay.
(sniffles)

11:46.706 --> 11:49.209
<i>SUE:</i>
<i>Josh, don't go any further,</i>

11:49.275 --> 11:51.678

a really stupid idea.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.423

<i>‐Don't.</i>

12:05.592 --> 12:06.793
Listen to me.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.528
The fire.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.029
I think it's coming
from the floor below.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.431
What do I do now?

12:11.497 --> 12:13.466
<i>JOSH:</i>

12:15.134 --> 12:16.936

she was blocking your car in?

12:17.003 --> 12:19.105
Yeah, she is,
with a baseball bat!

12:19.172 --> 12:21.908
Get out of that car
and tell me where my child is!

12:21.975 --> 12:24.677

Tracie in a month.

‐I swear fore God, Keith,
I'm not playing with you!

‐(car door closes)
‐Come on out, coward!

12:30.516 --> 12:32.952
If you hit that vehicle,
I have to arrest you.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.288
‐Oh, thank you.
‐My daughter's missing!

12:35.355 --> 12:36.923
I know he did something to her!

12:36.990 --> 12:38.358
I understand you're upset,

12:38.424 --> 12:39.826
but getting yourself arrested
will not solve anything.

12:39.892 --> 12:43.796
Why are you talking to her?!
She's been terrorizing me

12:43.863 --> 12:45.798
for the past half an hour.
You need to arrest her!

12:45.865 --> 12:49.102
Shut your mouth and that window.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.275
Tell me about your daughter.

12:55.341 --> 12:58.044
Tracie. Just turned 21.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.646
She's been gone for two days.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.447
Hasn't been home,
hasn't been to work.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.116
Her friends haven't heard
from her.

13:03.182 --> 13:04.384
I'm losing my mind here.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.618
You think he knows where she is?

13:05.685 --> 13:08.621
She broke it off with him
a few weeks back.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.724
And he's not the type
who likes to be told "no."

13:24.337 --> 13:27.240
Talk and don't even think
about lying to me.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.342
Uh, I don't know where she is.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.311
I haven't seen
or talked to her in weeks.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.179
Where have you been
the last two days?

13:33.246 --> 13:34.681
Moving into my mama's basement.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.015
A million people saw me there.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.051
I'm gonna need you
to start making a list

13:38.117 --> 13:39.652
of those million people.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.854
Okay.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.857
Did you file a police report?

13:44.924 --> 13:47.894
They asked me if I was sure
she didn't just run away.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.730
Then they said
they'd get back to me.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.365
I'm not holding my breath.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.201
Didn't seem like
my girl was a high priority.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.104

14:07.580 --> 14:09.215
aside from a photo
and the initial

14:09.282 --> 14:10.683
statement from her mother?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.919
This is Nelson's case, right?

14:12.985 --> 14:15.154
Would be if he were working it.
Instead,

14:15.221 --> 14:16.422
he decided to wait and see.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.157
Maybe she'll just
come back on her own.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.692
She's not the kind
of missing girl

14:19.759 --> 14:21.594
that makes the evening news.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.163
Solid job, solid family.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.631
No history of drugs or alcohol.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.302
‐Oh. There's an ex.
‐Yeah, with an alibi.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.838
I was gonna go by her place
of business,

14:31.904 --> 14:34.674
‐talk to the folks there.
‐Well, you want some company?

14:34.741 --> 14:36.309
I'm sure Nelson won't mind.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.678
I'm sure Nelson won't notice.

18:53.265 --> 18:55.067
but you need to take care
of yourself, too.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.936
It's like she always says,

18:57.003 --> 18:58.504
"We've all got people
we love out there.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.107
The best thing we can do
is our jobs."

19:01.173 --> 19:03.142
I remember you
saying that to me.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.511
I got it from her.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.815

from her.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.183

19:15.021 --> 19:16.322

19:16.389 --> 19:18.858
W‐We are just gonna
have all the faith in her

19:18.924 --> 19:21.661
that she's had
in all of us, right?

19:23.095 --> 19:25.398
She's gonna pull through this.

<i>HEN:</i>
<i>I didn't even know</i>

19:27.233 --> 19:30.002

‐Exactly.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.437
That's the problem.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.272
I'm a police officer,
and I didn't know

19:33.339 --> 19:34.807
there was a missing girl.

19:34.874 --> 19:39.011
That mother came to us for help,
and they couldn't be bothered.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.546
"Wait and see if she turns up."

19:40.613 --> 19:43.149
We wouldn't be waiting
and seeing if that was

19:43.215 --> 19:44.650
a 20‐something‐year‐old
white woman.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.419
We'd be out combing the streets.

19:46.485 --> 19:48.654
Mm‐hmm. You know,
when I was a kid,

19:48.721 --> 19:51.624
the cops used to do a community
outreach in my neighborhood.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.627
They'd, like, you know,
play basketball with the kids,

19:54.694 --> 19:57.029
do little dances with them.

19:57.096 --> 20:00.566
Always coming to the cookout,
so to speak.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.836
But to this day,
I have never seen police

20:03.903 --> 20:06.272
hooping with kids
in Beverly Hills.

20:06.338 --> 20:09.842
You know, it makes you wonder,
why, why do they need to know us

20:09.909 --> 20:11.911
to do the job
that they're paid for?

20:11.977 --> 20:14.980
Tens of thousands
of missing people.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.717
And we just write them off.

20:18.517 --> 20:20.519
You thinking about
that little girl?

20:20.586 --> 20:22.922
The one who disappeared
when you were a kid?

20:22.988 --> 20:24.590
No.

20:24.657 --> 20:28.027
I'm thinking about
my little girl.

20:28.094 --> 20:32.832

get a place of her own.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.602
I bet you shut that down
real quick.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.472
Why does everybody think
I'm such a hard‐ass

20:39.538 --> 20:41.941
that all I know
how to do is say no?

20:42.007 --> 20:44.076
Don't answer that.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.411
(laughs softly)

20:45.478 --> 20:47.346
I told her it would be okay.

20:47.413 --> 20:51.217
You know, giving Nia back

20:51.283 --> 20:53.219
was the hardest thing
I've ever done.

20:53.285 --> 20:55.621
‐Mm.
‐And not just because

20:55.688 --> 20:57.757
I loved her as my own,

20:57.823 --> 21:01.460
or that she had become
part of the family.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.429
It was the fear

21:03.496 --> 21:07.166
that she was going back
into a bad situation.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.569
That someone would hurt her,

21:10.636 --> 21:13.305
and I wouldn't be there
to protect her.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.741
Well, May's an adult.

21:15.808 --> 21:19.845
I have to accept that I can't
protect her anymore.

21:19.912 --> 21:23.482
All the bad things that
you see in the world, Athena,

21:23.549 --> 21:28.053
and your... your baby bird is
trying to leave the nest?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.189
You're allowed to be scared.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.591
You know what scares me more?

21:33.659 --> 21:35.828
Becoming that voice

21:35.895 --> 21:39.865
inside my daughter's head
that makes her doubt herself.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.835
Then don't.

21:42.902 --> 21:46.071
Be the voice that teaches her
to protect herself

21:46.138 --> 21:48.607
when the world doesn't.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.011
If she wants
to leave the nest...

21:52.077 --> 21:54.847
be the voice
that teaches her how to fly.

What was she doing at a casino?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.536
ATHENA:
Winning, apparently.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.205
Her coworker said she'd go
a couple of nights a week,

22:53.272 --> 22:54.540
clean up playing poker.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.976
So, what, she was
hustling guys at cards?

22:57.042 --> 22:59.011
I didn't say that.
I said she was good.

22:59.078 --> 23:02.147
Whatever the guys assumed about
her skills, that's on them.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.482

23:03.549 --> 23:04.650
They're talking,

23:04.717 --> 23:05.985

23:06.051 --> 23:07.353
Never looks at him.

23:07.419 --> 23:09.755
I'm guessing they probably
didn't come in together.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.857
No... but they left together.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.459
RANSONE:
Mm. Hmm.

23:13.525 --> 23:14.960
Too much to drink?

23:15.027 --> 23:18.030
Waitress said she didn't
serve her alcohol.

23:18.097 --> 23:21.033
Two iced teas and a water.

down and grabs her purse.

23:25.537 --> 23:28.173
RANSONE:
He moves his hand.
He put something in her drink.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.210
And then walks her out the door.

23:32.811 --> 23:33.979
RANSONE:
Maybe we'll get lucky,

23:34.046 --> 23:35.347
and he'll drive
towards the camera.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.549

23:37.616 --> 23:38.584
There he is.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.720

He must have

23:41.787 --> 23:43.255
one of those blocker covers.

23:43.322 --> 23:45.190

Red.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.795

ATHENA:
Heard she wasn't the first girl.

39:13.451 --> 39:16.120
RANSONE:
Probably the third.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.589
We got lucky.

39:17.655 --> 39:19.791
We found her just in time.

ATHENA:
I'm not sure
how lucky she feels.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.438
You changed your mind
about me moving out?

39:33.504 --> 39:35.440
No. I know that
this is something

39:35.506 --> 39:38.943
that's important to you,
but knowing that you're okay?

39:39.010 --> 39:40.345
That's what's important to me.

39:40.411 --> 39:42.747
So I've made a list
of acceptable neighborhoods,

39:42.814 --> 39:46.017
what to look for in a building,
what to avoid.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.586
These are my conditions.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.290
Oh. This is a lot of conditions.

39:52.357 --> 39:54.726
Some are negotiable.
Some are not.

39:54.792 --> 39:57.495
Starting with no first‐floor
apartments, no balconies.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.697
Also, once you've narrowed down
the field,

39:59.764 --> 40:03.067
I want to take a look in person,
meet your building manager.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.669
Run a background check?

40:04.736 --> 40:07.639
I just want to keep you safe.
