02:17.762 --> 02:19.764
Why don't they make trains
like this anymore?

02:20.348 --> 02:22.725
Our generation's not allowed
to have nice things.

02:30.775 --> 02:35.238
Never thought I'd say this,
but these make me miss the heroin.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.528
-God, I miss...
-...this.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.156
Me, too.

03:25.830 --> 03:30.251
Life on beta blockers...
is no life at all.

03:31.252 --> 03:32.086
What?

03:33.421 --> 03:36.299
-We're not alone.
-From last night?

03:36.382 --> 03:38.259
Aye, from last night.

03:38.968 --> 03:42.222
Though what drove me
to such recklessness, I can't say.

03:42.931 --> 03:47.685
-I'm Riley and this is Will.
-Oh, nice try.

03:48.269 --> 03:53.399
But you can just call me...
the Old Man of Hoy.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.362
What's his name?

03:57.445 --> 03:59.113
He doesn't trust us.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.074
[Mr. Hoy] Of course I don't trust you.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.744
I barely escaped with my frontal lobes
from your wee disco.

04:04.827 --> 04:05.954
[Riley] So did we.

04:06.913 --> 04:10.375
It seems like you took your blockers
at the same we took ours.

04:10.458 --> 04:16.256
Aye, maybe it's true that you got out
like me by the hair on your chinny-chin.

04:16.881 --> 04:22.679
Or maybe, just maybe,
you were supposed to get out.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.975
He thinks the concert was a BPO trap.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.560
I've seen more than my fair share
of snares.

04:31.354 --> 04:37.151
[sighs] You do not remain free
for 30 years by being the trusting kind.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.451
Now, whether I'm right or wrong about you,

04:46.077 --> 04:51.541
I suspect we'll be seeing each other again
soon enough.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.034
[Sun] I have to go.

05:27.785 --> 05:28.786

05:40.298 --> 05:42.050

-But what?

You were out all day,
you slept on the couch...

07:10.263 --> 07:11.431
Are you mad at me?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.266
No.

07:13.349 --> 07:17.019
-Or me?
-I've been mad at many things these days.

07:18.604 --> 07:19.772
Mostly myself.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.444
No, it's my fault. It's...
I push too much.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.155
-I get too excited about things.
-No, no, no. No, this is on me.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.407
I shouldn't have made an issue
out of the letter.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.326
No one needs to apologize.
Please, Dani, sit.

07:32.410 --> 07:36.164

It smells so freaking good!

We love how excited you get.

07:42.795 --> 07:43.754
We do.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.215
Family, I have something
very important to say.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.259
This is my mother's special omelet.

07:48.926 --> 07:52.555
She would cook this for my father
whenever he was missing Spain.

07:54.015 --> 07:57.268
You both know me well enough to know
that when I am upset,

07:58.186 --> 08:00.438
I cannot listen to anyone or anything.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.606
Oh, yeah.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.359
But last night, I heard a voice...

08:06.819 --> 08:09.447
and that voice was speaking to me
as clear as a bell.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.200
What did it say?

08:12.283 --> 08:17.371
It said, "Pack your bags, family.

I heard I had a visitor at the office
the other day.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.757
-I shouldn't have come.
-No. The guys you met are assholes.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.218
They're sons of the rich
who play at journalism

09:54.302 --> 09:57.221

It's true. I've also loved men.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.951
I fall in love with the person,
not their genitals.

talks like a greeting card, but...

how beautiful the world can be.

24:03.191 --> 24:07.195
Kenyan men... we both know
they're not very open-minded.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.572
That's true.

24:09.239 --> 24:12.284
So... a little surprising.

24:13.326 --> 24:15.036
Not as much as you think.

24:18.707 --> 24:22.919
Did you ever wonder why Silas had such
easy access to the drugs that I needed?

24:27.174 --> 24:28.800
We both have the virus.

24:31.386 --> 24:35.932
And what's more, he told me
that very soon, they may have a cure.

24:44.524 --> 24:45.692
Now why are you crying?

24:51.198 --> 24:52.908
Because I sometimes forget that...

24:55.994 --> 24:58.038
life's not just full of surprises.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.335
It's also full of gifts.

25:07.839 --> 25:08.757
Yes.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.369
Oh, man.

25:37.953 --> 25:38.787
What?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.288
It's amazing.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.750
Whole underground world
of abandoned places

25:43.833 --> 25:45.877
people use like their hotel rooms.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.421
It's more like camping.

25:48.505 --> 25:51.675
The same rules, you try to leave it better
than how you found it.

25:51.758 --> 25:54.928
If I had a good show, I'd always try
and leave a little gift somewhere.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.639
-Like what?
-Mm...

25:58.265 --> 26:00.934
Money. Drugs. Music.

26:04.479 --> 26:06.022
Where did you get those?

26:06.106 --> 26:07.440
[Riley] Train station.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.985
Thought we could use them
to cover the windows.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.569
Confuse anyone dropping in.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.865
Have I mentioned
how in love with you I am?

26:25.625 --> 26:27.335
It really isn't the same, is it?

26:27.419 --> 26:30.297
Well... it's not bad.

26:32.716 --> 26:36.428
It could be the way that older couples
who've been together a long time feel like

26:36.511 --> 26:37.554
when they kiss.

26:38.888 --> 26:42.392
Yeah, I like the idea of a long life
spent kissing you.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.728
Mm-hm.

26:48.773 --> 26:53.069
Eh... this is some
stomach-churning domesticity.

26:53.153 --> 26:56.197
Seriously. This is factory-farming shit.

26:56.781 --> 26:59.242
Oh, no. Another visitor?

26:59.326 --> 27:02.996
-Did the blockers wear off early?
-Take your complaint to the FDA, mate.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.583
-It's Puck.
-From the lab?

27:06.666 --> 27:09.919
Oh, sharp as a bowling ball.

27:10.003 --> 27:12.881
I don't understand. If you're a sensate,
why didn't we connect?

27:12.964 --> 27:15.884
-Three guesses.
-Must've been on blockers when we met.

27:15.967 --> 27:19.304
Ding. Bowling ball continues to impress.

27:19.387 --> 27:21.514
Hey, ask him how he avoids BPO.

27:21.598 --> 27:25.226
Oh! Ask him if you and I can have
just a quick fuck.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.021
-[groans]
-[Puck moaning]

27:28.104 --> 27:29.272
What did he say?

27:30.148 --> 27:33.568
-He's not being very helpful.
-Why, am I supposed to be?

27:34.235 --> 27:37.030
At Vincent's, you knew what blockers were
and you didn't tell me.

27:37.113 --> 27:40.158
-Oh, I told you enough.
-Tell him that we need help.

27:40.658 --> 27:43.286
If nothing changes,
if no one figures out how to stop BPO,

27:43.370 --> 27:45.038
then one day he's gonna need
the same kind of help.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.331
Over here, hero.

27:47.374 --> 27:48.917
Free advice:

27:49.000 --> 27:53.421
if you bump into one of our kind,
assume that they are BPO collaborators.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.715
Be particularly suspicious

27:55.799 --> 27:58.927
if you hear about their daring escape
from The Rock in Iceland,

27:59.010 --> 28:03.723
while also appearing live on stage
at an underground EDM concert.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.559
He doesn't trust us either.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.063
-Can you blame me?
-Why come to the concert?

28:10.647 --> 28:13.775
What can I say?
The dick wants what the dick wants.

28:15.193 --> 28:20.698
Sex... can be such a good trust-builder.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.868
I don't think so.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.674
[speaking Italian]

28:37.757 --> 28:39.342
Can you tell me
where you get your blockers?

28:39.426 --> 28:41.052
I make them myself, puttanella.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.930
Listen, the hardest part
is getting the samples

28:44.013 --> 28:45.306
without a leash around my neck.

28:45.390 --> 28:50.103
But lucky you seem to already have yours,
the latest ones with less side effects.

28:50.770 --> 28:53.106
Seems like somebody
might have a friend at BPO.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.150
Wait.

28:56.484 --> 28:59.654
Blockers aren't gonna keep you safe
forever, Riley Blue. Not from BPO.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.742
And not from me.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.210
What did he say?

29:16.045 --> 29:21.050
I think I just picked up the equivalent
of a sensate STD.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.595

-Hey, Monsieur Gorilla, where's the ball?

29:40.445 --> 29:43.907
Where did the ball go?
Oh, it's in your goal!

29:45.492 --> 29:47.744
Come on, Felix, stop trash-talking.
Let's play!

30:02.926 --> 30:04.594
Where are you? Here!

30:16.397 --> 30:17.482
Ah!

30:19.609 --> 30:21.402
-[Wolfgang] Hey, you all right?
-I'm fine.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.121
-That's what I'm talking about!
-You all right?

30:34.833 --> 30:37.085

That was fucking real!

31:24.799 --> 31:27.510
Do you have to do everything so intensely?

31:28.261 --> 31:29.262
No.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.849
Just the things that matter.

31:35.351 --> 31:36.644
[gasps] Oh...

31:36.728 --> 31:38.855
These are the last year reports

31:38.938 --> 31:41.691
Yeah, you can just put them there.

31:41.774 --> 31:42.817
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.278
Um...

31:46.905 --> 31:48.656
About last night...

31:49.824 --> 31:54.329
I... needed you and you were there for me.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.582
But it was wrong.

31:57.665 --> 31:58.750
Why?

31:59.500 --> 32:00.919
You know why.

32:05.423 --> 32:08.509
You weren't in my bed any more
than I'm sitting on this desk here.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.262
It's in our heads, like a fantasy.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.098
Last night was not a fantasy.

32:15.099 --> 32:18.186
What's true is that married women
like to fantasize.

32:18.686 --> 32:22.065
-It's what keeps marriages together.
-No.

32:22.649 --> 32:23.816
I don't. I...

32:24.734 --> 32:26.027
I must not.

32:26.527 --> 32:29.614
Okay, you're in Bombay, I'm in Berlin.
I think you're safe.

32:29.697 --> 32:34.035
Please. Last night made me realize
that I can't be trusted with my thoughts.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.496
Come on, Wolfie!
Let's finish Fuchs' Fucks!

32:37.914 --> 32:40.500
I need help and you have to help me.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.920
I'm trying to make a life.

32:44.003 --> 32:44.837
Hmm.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.757
Pretending isn't a life.

32:48.257 --> 32:50.426
-[Felix] Wolfie!
-Yeah! Coming!

33:04.941 --> 33:07.944
So... big day tomorrow.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.031
Do you know what you're gonna say?

33:14.158 --> 33:16.953
What... Do you think
I should say something?

33:17.036 --> 33:19.330
You don't have to do it
if you don't feel comfortable.

33:19.414 --> 33:20.581
Yes. Absolutely.

33:21.332 --> 33:25.545
But... you're so good
when you speak from your heart.

33:26.129 --> 33:29.257
Baby, the interview you did
at the premiere was incredible.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.718
I think it had a lot to do
with these people inviting you.

33:31.801 --> 33:34.971
Of course.
I mean, it has over a million views.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.057
-Really?
-You haven't watched it?

33:39.392 --> 33:41.144
I'm banned from social media.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.146
You just love to look at the bad stuff.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.940
-Yeah, that is true.
-[Hernando] Mm-hmm.

33:52.989 --> 33:55.241

Oh, my God. Look! Look!

Thank you, São Paulo!

35:30.419 --> 35:31.629
Thank you.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.843

that I am very honored to be here.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.554
[cheering]

35:46.602 --> 35:47.979
That isn't the truth.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.359
To be honest with you, I...

35:54.986 --> 35:57.405
I have never been as scared
as I am right now.

36:00.366 --> 36:05.037
All of my life, I've had to pretend
to be something I wasn't.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.541
And to become what I wanted to become...

36:10.334 --> 36:11.836
I couldn't be what I am.

-[cheering]

36:43.618 --> 36:44.660
Oh.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.584
Why did I have to be so afraid
to say that?

36:52.960 --> 36:57.089
Because I know that people are afraid
of people that are different from them.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.592
And admitting that I am different

36:59.675 --> 37:02.595
and refusing to pretend
to be something I am not,

37:02.678 --> 37:05.514
may cost me a career of pretending
to be things that I am not,

37:05.598 --> 37:08.726
which is kind of crazy
when you think about it.

37:08.809 --> 37:09.810
But I did.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.271
I did.

37:12.355 --> 37:15.942
For years, I was living
inside the fake world of a movie set,

37:16.025 --> 37:19.070
never daring to imagine that one day...

37:20.488 --> 37:24.075
I might be brave enough
to do something like this.

And whatever it costs
for me to be able to do this...

But why?

41:49.840 --> 41:50.925
I can take it.

41:52.718 --> 41:56.055

is a black hole

to make my wedding all about you.

42:21.997 --> 42:24.667
Actually, there is one thing
I could really use some help on--

42:24.750 --> 42:25.709
Nom!

42:26.710 --> 42:28.379
It's the cabin!

42:28.462 --> 42:30.589
-What?
-I emailed Abrasax Electronics.

42:30.673 --> 42:34.009
They found an old shipping report
and, oh, my God!

42:34.093 --> 42:36.220
-What?
-It's up near Dancing Water.

42:37.930 --> 42:40.432
-That's weird.
-What's Dancing Water?

42:40.516 --> 42:43.936
Um, that's the commune
where Neets grew up.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.020
-Um...
-Mom is gonna freak!

42:45.104 --> 42:48.691
-Okay, we gotta get up there.
-I'm sure she'll want to come.

42:48.774 --> 42:51.569
-I'm gonna text her. Bye, sweetie.
-Bye.

42:51.652 --> 42:56.574
I'm-- I love you. But I gotta...
I gotta go. Okay, just call me.

42:58.534 --> 43:01.537
[beeping]

43:06.375 --> 43:08.127
[Elizabeth's voice overlapping]
Come on, sleepy.

43:08.210 --> 43:10.379
The world isn't going to save itself.

43:33.360 --> 43:37.156
[Chelsea, voice echoing]
Daddy, look what I made!

43:38.741 --> 43:42.202
Now this line describing the flank,
that is sublime.

43:42.786 --> 43:44.997
Come, let Daddy get dressed.

44:14.860 --> 44:16.403
[line ringing]

44:17.196 --> 44:18.656
[man] Good morning, Milton.

44:19.156 --> 44:21.033
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

44:21.116 --> 44:24.453
The Chairman is very excited.
It's a very big day for us.

44:24.953 --> 44:27.289
-It is.
-We are counting on you.

44:27.373 --> 44:28.540
How are you feeling?

44:33.545 --> 44:34.672
Are you all right?

44:37.091 --> 44:38.550
Something's about to happen.

44:41.387 --> 44:42.680
Something bad.

44:52.815 --> 44:53.732
Ah!

44:54.441 --> 44:55.442
What the fuck?

44:56.527 --> 44:57.945
I was bored.

45:02.699 --> 45:03.909
Don't bother on my account.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.037
Where have you been?

45:07.121 --> 45:08.580
Did you miss me?

45:09.623 --> 45:12.960
I know you want to tell her to fuck off,
but we need information.

45:15.129 --> 45:16.338
You use blockers.

45:17.047 --> 45:18.590
Everyone does.

45:18.674 --> 45:21.510
-Where do you get them from?
-My contact.

45:21.593 --> 45:24.972
-Does he have a name?
-Yeah. "My Business."

45:25.681 --> 45:27.724
I thought you said
we could help each other.

45:27.808 --> 45:30.060
Not that. Ask something else.

45:30.561 --> 45:31.728
Show her the picture.

45:36.442 --> 45:38.360
Do you know who this guy is?

45:41.196 --> 45:43.198
-Walk away, Lila.
-[Wolfgang] Hmm?

45:44.575 --> 45:45.868
You do know him.

45:48.036 --> 45:49.621
Walk away now.

46:06.138 --> 46:08.223
Love to talk, but my date's arrived.

46:28.410 --> 46:29.661
[Wolfgang] I wouldn't.

46:31.121 --> 46:33.373
-Why?
-Two of the goons were rentals.

46:33.916 --> 46:36.668
They'll go in, sweep the room,
then head back out here.

47:35.060 --> 47:37.729
Ah... Ms. Facchini.

47:37.813 --> 47:39.106
Mr. Bohm.

47:39.189 --> 47:40.649
I was hoping it'd be you.

47:42.234 --> 47:43.318
Why?

47:47.239 --> 47:49.616
Fuchs doesn't see what you are.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.618
He doesn't know.

47:51.702 --> 47:52.786
But I do.

47:53.787 --> 47:55.747
You are just like me.

47:55.831 --> 47:56.707
You're in luck--

48:05.215 --> 48:06.842
Was he right about you?

48:06.925 --> 48:10.429
If you're trying to find a difference
between us, you're wasting your time.

48:10.512 --> 48:12.681
I'm not the one with a leash
around my neck.

48:13.181 --> 48:16.727
-Lila, why are you still talking to him?
-I know what I'm doing.

48:16.810 --> 48:18.604
You said we needed each other,

48:18.687 --> 48:21.398
but as soon as I ask you for something,
you walk away.

48:21.481 --> 48:22.858
Be smart.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.861
-How long has he been after you?
-A year.

48:25.944 --> 48:28.447
-A year?
-That has to be a lie.

48:29.448 --> 48:32.326
-Maybe the Cannibal is getting slow.
-The Cannibal?

48:32.909 --> 48:35.954
Clustercide. Story is he ate his own.

48:36.038 --> 48:38.749
-Do you know his real name?
-No one does.

48:38.832 --> 48:40.292
Someone must.

48:40.375 --> 48:42.002
This cluster is dead.

48:44.171 --> 48:45.589
Is this one of yours?

48:46.048 --> 48:49.384
Yeah. He thought you were as hot as I do.

48:50.010 --> 48:52.262
But right now, all he thinks
is that you're lying.

48:52.346 --> 48:54.014
What do you think?

48:55.515 --> 48:56.350
We'll see.

49:05.484 --> 49:09.363
You know, you never think about
how ubiquitous immigrant food

49:09.446 --> 49:12.699
like General Tso's chicken
and pepperoni pizza has become--

49:12.783 --> 49:15.035
Until you realize you're
a different human species on the run

49:15.118 --> 49:17.371
from an evil organization
trying to lobotomize you?

49:17.454 --> 49:18.288
Exactly.

49:25.337 --> 49:27.631
Did we make a mistake doing the concert?

49:27.714 --> 49:31.343
No. It just proved there's a whole bunch
more of us out there than we thought,

49:31.426 --> 49:33.970
and that there must be some kind
of an intelligence network

49:34.054 --> 49:35.597
because they all seemed to know
who you were.

49:35.681 --> 49:38.600
We just have to try and figure out a way
to get them to trust us.

49:38.684 --> 49:40.811
Aye, that's the rub, laddie.

49:42.104 --> 49:43.522
Mr. Hoy is back.

49:43.605 --> 49:47.859
What a charming little empty box
you've chosen here.

49:47.943 --> 49:51.571
All the modern amenities of a prison cell.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.198
Where are you visiting from?

49:53.281 --> 49:57.536
I call it my speakeasy
'cause you can speak easy in here.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.664
Soundproofing. Eighteen inches thick.

50:01.957 --> 50:04.292
All the modern amenities of a coffin.

50:04.376 --> 50:05.794
Aye.

50:06.420 --> 50:12.134
So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie
are not a pair of headhunters,

50:12.217 --> 50:14.803
putting on your show was a terrible risk.

50:14.886 --> 50:17.556
Care to explain what possessed you?

50:18.682 --> 50:22.394
Well, Mr. Hoy,
if you're not a BPO headhunter,

50:22.477 --> 50:26.022
then leaving your coffin
to come to my show was a terrible risk.

50:27.190 --> 50:29.943
-What possessed you?
-Huh...

50:32.195 --> 50:36.533
Maybe... after 30 years of surviving...

50:38.368 --> 50:42.456
not living, mind you, but surviving...

50:43.623 --> 50:47.711
maybe after 30 years of blockers,
and coffins, and boxes...

50:48.962 --> 50:54.426
maybe I realized...
I'm slowly dying of survival.

51:00.640 --> 51:01.725
[sighs]

51:02.642 --> 51:04.144
I'm sick of this.

51:05.520 --> 51:07.397
-I'm done playing by the rules.
-What are you doing?

51:07.981 --> 51:10.984
-What's going on?
-Mr. Hoy needs a reason to trust us.

51:29.294 --> 51:30.587
There you are, Mr. Hoy.

51:31.630 --> 51:35.550
Aye, well, you do not need
to be Sherlock Holmes.

51:36.676 --> 51:39.387
If you're a headhunter
or looking to make a deal with BPO,

51:39.471 --> 51:41.264
you know where to find me.

51:41.848 --> 51:42.849
Ach!

51:43.350 --> 51:45.852
You've gone and done it now, Miss Blue.

51:46.728 --> 51:48.313
You've done it now.

51:49.314 --> 51:54.653
I'm not about to be out-trusted
by a DJ from Iceland.

51:54.736 --> 51:58.365
[chuckles] With hair the color of a Smurf!

51:58.448 --> 52:02.410
Come on now, Miss Blue.
Let's get out of here.

52:02.994 --> 52:05.705
Come on, Miss Blue! My library.

52:10.210 --> 52:12.921
And this is my laboratory.

52:14.005 --> 52:15.006
This way.

52:30.939 --> 52:34.401
Welcome to the Highlands of Scotland,
Miss Blue.

52:35.068 --> 52:36.695
[Riley] It's beautiful.

52:37.988 --> 52:39.322
Reminds me of home.

52:41.449 --> 52:42.617
[woman] Dinner's ready.

52:42.701 --> 52:44.703
Aye, just a moment.

52:44.786 --> 52:48.039
Has another of your invisible friends
dropped by?

52:48.123 --> 52:52.085
Aye, Kirsty. This is Miss Blue.
She's from Iceland.

52:52.168 --> 52:55.505
A lady invisible friend, is it?

52:56.047 --> 52:59.634
Well, now, there's a turn-up for the book.

53:00.927 --> 53:02.637
Invite her in.

53:03.221 --> 53:06.182
There's stovies and mushy peas,

53:06.266 --> 53:09.728
-and fried Mars bar for dessert.
-[chuckles]

53:13.273 --> 53:14.733
She's lovely.

53:14.816 --> 53:17.068
She's a sweet old bird, all right.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.906
-Is she family?
-More than most.

53:21.489 --> 53:23.575
She was the wife of one of my cluster.

53:24.159 --> 53:27.829
I was with him when he died.
He asked me to take care of her.

53:28.830 --> 53:33.251
But the funny thing is,
I think I'm looking after her,

53:33.335 --> 53:35.754
and she thinks she's looking after me.

53:37.088 --> 53:39.090
But who's to know who's right, eh?

53:44.846 --> 53:48.224
[Amanita grunts] This is
where the dads said it should be.

53:49.017 --> 53:50.936
I really love your dads.

53:52.020 --> 53:55.315
Just the fact that they all wanted
to take care of you

53:55.398 --> 53:57.692
and be a part of your life.

53:57.776 --> 53:59.069
People used to give me shit

53:59.152 --> 54:02.364
when I used to use all three
of their names on my school forms.

54:02.447 --> 54:05.533
But I think I knew I was pretty lucky
in the dad department.

54:07.702 --> 54:11.456
Do you think what my dad said about me
to Teagan is true?

54:12.916 --> 54:15.085
That you're a black hole of narcissism?

54:17.253 --> 54:20.966
Look, most of us either have our heads
stuck in the sand or stuck up our own ass.

54:21.049 --> 54:24.678
It's human nature to think our problems
are the only problems.

54:25.512 --> 54:29.224
Neets... God, I'm sorry.

54:30.058 --> 54:32.811
I've been... let's be generous and say

54:32.894 --> 54:36.398
not entirely myself
and focused on many other things.

54:37.107 --> 54:39.234
You mean besides your amazing girlfriend?

54:39.734 --> 54:44.322
Who's been beyond amazing.
Like, approaching saint status.

54:44.406 --> 54:45.490
[laughs]

54:45.573 --> 54:47.242
I would look good as a statue.

54:47.575 --> 54:48.785
I'm serious.

54:50.078 --> 54:54.457
I know I could not survive
any of this crazy shit without you.

55:06.219 --> 55:07.220
What?

55:08.138 --> 55:09.180
It's her.

55:10.056 --> 55:11.057
Angelica?

55:14.811 --> 55:17.313
[both chuckle]

55:18.106 --> 55:19.441
[Mr. Hoy] Spring of '52.

55:19.524 --> 55:22.902
A very, very covert conference
was convened

55:22.986 --> 55:25.363
at the British airbase on Cyprus.

55:25.447 --> 55:30.118
Authorities from NATO, the Warsaw Pact,
China, and the Arab League

55:30.201 --> 55:33.413
sat locked in a room debating reality.

55:33.496 --> 55:37.375
After weeks of haggling, walk-outs,
and bullying,

55:37.459 --> 55:42.005
the Biologic Preservation Organization
was born.

55:43.339 --> 55:44.883
How do you know all of this?

55:44.966 --> 55:46.134
I was there.

55:46.926 --> 55:51.723
I assisted Ruth El-Saadawi
in drafting the initial charter

55:51.806 --> 55:55.268
and guidelines
for research into sensacity.

55:55.769 --> 55:59.439
Signatories guaranteed human rights
to sensoriums

55:59.522 --> 56:04.652
and agreed not to deploy them
for military needs.

56:05.153 --> 56:06.613
That's Ruth there.

56:07.989 --> 56:09.365
Is that you?

56:09.449 --> 56:11.201
Handsome bugger, eh? [chuckles]

56:12.452 --> 56:13.953
Where did it all go?

56:14.496 --> 56:15.955
This is crazy cool.

56:16.039 --> 56:19.125
It's exactly what I read in that book
by the woman who started BPO.

56:19.209 --> 56:20.668
-Ruth El-Saadawi.
-Yes.

56:20.752 --> 56:23.379
She talked about psycellium
as a morphogenic field

56:23.463 --> 56:26.174
and how it made connections
like the synapses in our brain,

56:26.257 --> 56:28.676
storing them the way memories are stored.

56:29.844 --> 56:31.846
She's the mother of this claid.

56:33.223 --> 56:35.600
-What's a claid?
-A cluster.

56:35.683 --> 56:39.020
Sequoias are like us, polypliotic.

56:40.647 --> 56:43.108
-Can you still see her?
-Yeah.

56:44.526 --> 56:46.444
She lived here.

56:47.362 --> 56:50.240
The cabin is beautiful.

56:51.241 --> 56:54.160
-She looks so different.
-How do you mean?

57:01.209 --> 57:02.710
She looks happy.

57:04.838 --> 57:09.425
Why didn't the charter just announce
to the world that Homo sensoriums exist?

57:09.509 --> 57:13.930
Look, we all know sapiens.

57:14.013 --> 57:16.099
I mean, some of my best friends
are sapiens.

57:17.142 --> 57:21.396
When sapiens feel safe,
they're the nicest people you could meet.

57:21.479 --> 57:25.150
However, feed their inner demons,
frighten them,

57:25.733 --> 57:29.112
find reasons for them
to divide themselves from otherness,

57:29.195 --> 57:33.825
and then watch those selfsame sapiens
drop bombs on whole cities,

57:33.908 --> 57:37.036
drive planes into buildings

57:37.120 --> 57:40.582
and happily herd millions
of their own kind

57:40.665 --> 57:42.792
into gas chambers.

57:42.876 --> 57:45.962
And that's just what they would do
to each other.

57:46.463 --> 57:49.549
What wouldn't they do
to a totally different species?

57:50.049 --> 57:53.887
That's why Ruth herself
advocated total secrecy.

57:54.471 --> 57:56.806
Was Ms. El-Saadawi a sensate?

57:56.890 --> 57:59.851
No, but her twin sister was.

57:59.934 --> 58:02.103
They came from a village in Egypt.

58:02.187 --> 58:05.273
Not long after her sister's cluster birth,

58:05.899 --> 58:10.278
she was stoned to death
for immorality and witchcraft.

58:11.529 --> 58:15.366
Ruth went from being a doctor one day
to a crusader the next,

58:15.450 --> 58:19.871
and did everything she could to prevent it
from happening to someone else's sister.

58:21.748 --> 58:23.583
If she was alive today...

58:24.417 --> 58:27.337
she'd look at what BPO has become

58:27.921 --> 58:29.339
and she would weep.

58:32.509 --> 58:33.468
[Nomi] Wait.

58:33.927 --> 58:35.345
-[Amanita] What?
-Something's wrong.

58:36.012 --> 58:37.889
The research might be helpful.

58:37.972 --> 58:39.516
[man] That's what the Nazis said!

58:40.141 --> 58:41.684
You fucking hide out in Walden

58:41.768 --> 58:43.853
while they herd the rest of us
into cattle cars.

58:43.937 --> 58:46.648
[Angelica]
Do you think they might be right?

58:46.731 --> 58:47.815
[Jonas] I'll go to Iceland.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.901
She's fighting with her cluster.

58:49.984 --> 58:52.737
[Angelica] Be careful.

58:55.073 --> 58:57.784
Can I ask you
about one of the BPO hunters?

58:58.451 --> 58:59.577
Do you know him?

59:01.829 --> 59:03.331
If he's the one that's after you,

59:03.957 --> 59:10.880
I must say, I underestimated
either your recklessness or your courage.

59:11.631 --> 59:12.924
What's his real name?

59:13.007 --> 59:15.635
I don't know myself.
Not sure I want to know.

59:15.718 --> 59:22.016
When our kind have nightmares about BPO,
they're usually about him.

59:24.060 --> 59:26.729
-Where do I find him?
-Huh!

59:27.939 --> 59:30.483
I do not ken where you get
your brass goolies from,

59:31.526 --> 59:34.112
but maybe I'll be able
to give you what you want.

59:34.195 --> 59:37.740
But fair warning,
it comes with a price, like as not.

59:38.950 --> 59:40.201
I'll pay it.

59:41.077 --> 59:45.707
There's a network of us,
strung out about the world.

59:45.790 --> 59:47.750
The Archipelago, we're called.

59:47.834 --> 59:51.170
Isolated above, but connected below.

59:51.921 --> 59:55.633
I ask someone I know,
who asks someone they know, who asks...

59:55.717 --> 59:57.343
Well, you get the gist.

59:57.427 --> 1:00:00.638
Sapiens invented Google in the 1990s.

1:00:01.598 --> 1:00:05.310
We've had it since the Neolithic.

1:00:05.393 --> 1:00:06.686
[chuckles]

1:00:07.478 --> 1:00:09.063
How long does it take?

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:13.943
I'm looking for Cannibal.

1:00:42.221 --> 1:00:44.015
Get him on the phone now!

1:00:44.098 --> 1:00:47.518
I don't know what he thinks he's doing.
This is my research, this is my project.

1:00:47.602 --> 1:00:49.062
Tell him I'm gonna straighten him out!

1:00:51.814 --> 1:00:56.569
I've got the answer,
but I don't think you're going to like it.

1:01:00.281 --> 1:01:01.616
I was getting nervous.

1:01:03.076 --> 1:01:04.202
I'm all right.

1:01:05.828 --> 1:01:07.038
I learned a lot.

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:11.376
About BPO and how it changed
over the years.

1:01:13.419 --> 1:01:16.130
There's someone on the inside
who knows Whispers.

1:01:19.342 --> 1:01:20.343
Did you get a name?

1:01:21.344 --> 1:01:23.471
-Not yet.
-Why not?

1:01:27.225 --> 1:01:29.143
Mr. Hoy said I have to go to Chicago.

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:32.939
But I have to go alone.

1:01:36.317 --> 1:01:37.402
Nom!

1:01:53.793 --> 1:01:55.336
[Nomi] Dr. Metzger.

1:01:55.420 --> 1:01:58.005
I don't know what they taught you
in med school,

1:01:58.089 --> 1:02:03.177
but the word "helping" doesn't mean
handcuff people and chop up their brains.

1:02:03.261 --> 1:02:04.595
Prep her for surgery.

1:02:04.679 --> 1:02:05.888
Nomi, what have you done?

1:02:09.183 --> 1:02:10.226
Is he in there?

1:02:10.852 --> 1:02:12.145
What is he doing?

1:02:12.228 --> 1:02:15.022
I told you,
he's trying to destroy my work.

1:02:31.956 --> 1:02:33.124
I love you.

1:02:42.008 --> 1:02:44.844
You really believe
that neurografting is possible?

1:02:44.927 --> 1:02:47.180
God save us from this idiot.

1:02:58.900 --> 1:03:00.860
All that work lost.

1:03:00.943 --> 1:03:04.822
-What will we do now?
-I'll start over.

1:03:09.827 --> 1:03:10.745
What happened?

1:03:12.079 --> 1:03:15.792
I don't know. But everything
started to go wrong when Angelica...

1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:17.210
...went to Chicago.
