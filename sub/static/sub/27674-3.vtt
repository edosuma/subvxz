00:00.250 --> 00:01.663
(dramatic music)

00:01.663 --> 00:03.408
- [Male] Possible eyes on wanted fugitive.

00:03.408 --> 00:04.891
- Roger that, are you pushing in?

00:04.891 --> 00:06.393
- Stand still, stand still!

00:06.393 --> 00:08.245
- Go go go go go go go!

00:08.245 --> 00:11.090
- Nick Batchelor, your
time on the run is over.

00:11.090 --> 00:13.377
Paul, you have been hunted down.

00:13.377 --> 00:14.210
- Yes!

00:14.210 --> 00:15.314
(clapping)

00:15.314 --> 00:16.731
Get in there.

00:16.731 --> 00:20.056
- [Narrator] With two fugitives captured,

00:20.056 --> 00:21.960
eight remain at large.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.976
- [Emma] Come on Jess!

00:23.976 --> 00:27.156
- [Narrator] If they can
evade the hunters for 25 days.

00:27.156 --> 00:28.965
- Oh for God's sake, no.

00:28.965 --> 00:31.830
- [Narrator] They'll
win a share of Â£100,000.

00:31.830 --> 00:33.663
- Can I come with you?

00:34.545 --> 00:36.362
Ah, it worked!

00:36.362 --> 00:39.209
- Matthew Mason is
essentially an elite soldier.

00:39.209 --> 00:41.240
That makes him technically a machine.

00:41.240 --> 00:44.151
- Heading to Abergavenny,
boom boom boom boom boom.

00:44.151 --> 00:46.559
- So we've got his Google Map history.

00:46.559 --> 00:48.575
This does look like a route.

00:48.575 --> 00:49.945
There he is, there he is.

00:49.945 --> 00:50.778
- Yes!

00:50.778 --> 00:55.778
- Every pub, every hotel,
say, "Have you seen this man?"

00:55.779 --> 00:58.138
- [Ben] Emma and Jess, both nurses.

00:58.138 --> 00:59.766
- [Emma] I'll get in the front.

00:59.766 --> 01:00.974
- I want it so much.

01:00.974 --> 01:03.019
- [Female] That's Stewart McCray.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.352
- Find that car.

01:06.035 --> 01:08.468
- [Female] That's them, that's the car.

01:08.468 --> 01:09.969
- That was a Volvo XC90.

01:09.969 --> 01:11.191
- There's no way they know we're here,

01:11.191 --> 01:14.108
there was nobody following us here.

01:22.838 --> 01:25.588
(dramatic music)

01:31.641 --> 01:33.835
- [Steve] That is his
vehicle, Craig's vehicle.

01:33.835 --> 01:35.731
- We've got an image
through of that vehicle.

01:35.731 --> 01:38.827
- [Peter] Stand by, we've
got a location we think.

01:38.827 --> 01:41.195
- [Narrator] Having cracked
Jess and Emma's network,

01:41.195 --> 01:43.922
the hunters have identified
their most recent journey

01:43.922 --> 01:46.422
with associate Stewart McCray.

01:47.812 --> 01:50.655
- Paul and Jill, could
you go as a priority?

01:50.655 --> 01:52.871
We believe that they're there.

01:52.871 --> 01:54.734
- [Paul] Yeah no worries mate.

01:54.734 --> 01:57.041
- [Emma] Am I allowed one drumstick?

01:57.041 --> 01:58.307
- [Jess] There's only one.

01:58.307 --> 01:59.140
- There's only one?

01:59.140 --> 01:59.973
- [Jess] Yeah.

01:59.973 --> 02:00.806
- Are you serious?

02:00.806 --> 02:01.639
- Yep.

02:06.014 --> 02:07.642
- [Paul] Well there's people there.

02:07.642 --> 02:10.252
- Yeah, there's a lot of
movement in the lounge.

02:10.252 --> 02:12.488
- Oh, oh my God, Jess.

02:12.488 --> 02:15.277
Jess, Jess, that's not funny, oh my God.

02:15.277 --> 02:16.110
- Stop it.

02:16.985 --> 02:17.985
Dude, chill.

02:21.668 --> 02:23.259
That's the hunters.

02:23.259 --> 02:26.072
How do they know we're here?

02:26.072 --> 02:28.442
- [Emma] Jess, they're seeing
us climb over the fence.

02:28.442 --> 02:29.388
- [Jess] No they haven't.

02:29.388 --> 02:30.568
- [Emma] Yes they are,
they're right there.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.901
- At the back, at the back, at the back.

02:39.899 --> 02:41.482
- [Emma] Oh my God.

02:48.437 --> 02:49.795
- Lost here.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.289
Here here.

02:51.289 --> 02:52.706
- [Emma] Jess go.

02:54.385 --> 02:55.524
Oh my God.

02:55.524 --> 02:57.397
- Active message, decamp.

02:57.397 --> 02:59.057
- Roger that.

02:59.057 --> 03:00.427
Right, go go go.

03:00.427 --> 03:02.179
Go towards the property.

03:02.179 --> 03:05.448
Lost sighting of Emma and Jess
decamping from that property.

03:05.448 --> 03:08.316
- Mate, did you see a
girl run through here?

03:08.316 --> 03:09.455
- Round the back.

03:09.455 --> 03:11.038
- There?

03:11.038 --> 03:13.863
So lost in the back garden.

03:13.863 --> 03:15.932
Excuse me, is there a girl
running through your garden?

03:15.932 --> 03:18.083
- [Jill] Yeah, just seen her.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.666
Jess, stop running!

03:23.583 --> 03:25.381
Your time on the run is over.

03:25.381 --> 03:26.292
- Oh we got one.

03:26.292 --> 03:27.471
We got one, we got one.

03:27.471 --> 03:29.721
(laughing)

03:34.709 --> 03:37.827
- Emma, you've been hunted down.

03:37.827 --> 03:38.827
- Yes!

03:38.827 --> 03:41.615
Get in there.
(clapping)

03:41.615 --> 03:43.189
Oh, look at her face.

03:43.189 --> 03:44.942
- How has this happened?

03:44.942 --> 03:46.942
- [Emma] It's all right.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.593
- [Jess] Oh my God.

03:50.593 --> 03:51.958
I'm so sad.

03:51.958 --> 03:54.472
How have they found us here?

03:54.472 --> 03:55.457
Fuck you.

03:55.457 --> 03:56.361
- Nevermind.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.095
Don't be a sore loser, Jess.

03:58.095 --> 03:59.059
- Fuck off.

03:59.059 --> 04:01.309
(laughing)

04:03.598 --> 04:05.598
- What a touch of class.

04:09.922 --> 04:13.489
Jess told us quite
clearly to foxtrot Oscar.

04:13.489 --> 04:16.989
It makes the capture all that bit sweeter.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.564
- [Jess] It's been the
most stressful thing

04:21.564 --> 04:22.956
I think I've ever done.

04:22.956 --> 04:25.149
But I'm glad I did it with Emma.

04:25.149 --> 04:28.163
And we only had one
argument, so that's great.

04:28.163 --> 04:30.620
- [Emma] I've literally
had the time of my life.

04:30.620 --> 04:33.502
I've gained a lot more
confidence than I had before.

04:33.502 --> 04:38.335
And it's safe to say I will
never want to do a real crime.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.186
- Okay, only six remaining fugitives.

04:45.186 --> 04:46.741
What do we know about them?

04:46.741 --> 04:49.638
We will start with Frank and Harry.

04:49.638 --> 04:53.412
The last sighting of these
two is almost a week old,

04:53.412 --> 04:54.408
correct?

04:54.408 --> 04:56.238
- Yeah, southeast of Chester.

04:56.238 --> 04:59.071
Don't know the drop off point yet.

05:00.412 --> 05:02.705
- On the road again.

05:02.705 --> 05:05.700
Probably the biggest
issue about being so rural

05:05.700 --> 05:07.617
is going to the toilet.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.566
- [Frank] Basil!

05:09.566 --> 05:10.445
- [Harry] Yeah?

05:10.445 --> 05:11.983
- [Frank] Urgh, you aint
going for a number two

05:11.983 --> 05:12.988
in there are you?

05:12.988 --> 05:15.848
- Well I'm not going in a field again.

05:15.848 --> 05:16.792
Frank!

05:16.792 --> 05:17.741
Fuck off!

05:17.741 --> 05:18.991
Fuck off Frank!

05:19.826 --> 05:20.849
Stop!

05:20.849 --> 05:22.229
Fucking stop!

05:22.229 --> 05:25.202
Stop the fucking, no I swear...

05:25.202 --> 05:26.535
Frank!

05:26.535 --> 05:27.400
Stop!

05:27.400 --> 05:29.324
Fucking stop now!

05:29.324 --> 05:30.157
Frank!

05:31.376 --> 05:33.311
- [Peter] Ismail and Nathanael.

05:33.311 --> 05:35.998
- [Female] In Ismail's
name there are quite a few

05:35.998 --> 05:39.168
Amazon receipts where he has
bought survival equipment

05:39.168 --> 05:40.771
prior to him going on the run.

05:40.771 --> 05:43.881
- [Female] So they could
have just been camping out.

05:43.881 --> 05:47.207
- You know what, I honestly
feel so much better

05:47.207 --> 05:48.718
being out here.

05:48.718 --> 05:51.017
Out into the beautiful wilderness.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.434
- We thought about bringing hiking boots.

05:56.359 --> 06:00.246
Converses are like a
decent all round shoe.

06:00.246 --> 06:02.469
- We are city boys, out of our depth,

06:02.469 --> 06:05.228
but we will make it with Converses,

06:05.228 --> 06:07.222
we will make it without.

06:07.222 --> 06:08.959
- [Peter] Matt Mason.

06:08.959 --> 06:11.435
- Last sighting of him
generally southbound

06:11.435 --> 06:13.027
towards Abergavenny.

06:13.027 --> 06:16.147
- Cyber managed to get
hold of a hard drive.

06:16.147 --> 06:19.367
We've got walking routes,
we've got text messages,

06:19.367 --> 06:22.034
all pointing to that Wales area.

06:31.326 --> 06:32.576
- Just woke up.

06:36.003 --> 06:37.503
Midges everywhere.

06:38.881 --> 06:40.714
And it's father's day.

06:41.903 --> 06:43.491
(yawns)

06:43.491 --> 06:46.991
This is my first father's day as a father.

06:49.318 --> 06:51.977
Being in the marines,
you spend a lot of time

06:51.977 --> 06:54.802
traveling the world, you spend
a lot of time enjoying life,

06:54.802 --> 06:57.052
and I never thought I'd settle down.

06:57.052 --> 07:00.335
And then my wife came
along and it all changed.

07:00.335 --> 07:03.490
Now we've got a beautiful
nine month old son

07:03.490 --> 07:04.706
called Herry.

07:04.706 --> 07:06.674
He's the best thing that
every happened to me.

07:06.674 --> 07:08.787
I don't think fatherhood's changed me,

07:08.787 --> 07:11.195
but I think my wife
would probably disagree.

07:11.195 --> 07:12.837
She says I've gone a lot softer,

07:12.837 --> 07:15.100
find myself watching Britain's
Got Talent and crying.

07:15.100 --> 07:18.334
I'm only joking, I'm only joking, I don't.

07:18.334 --> 07:20.258
This is the first time I've been away

07:20.258 --> 07:22.719
for a substantive time from Herry.

07:22.719 --> 07:25.414
The more he grows the more I realize that

07:25.414 --> 07:28.040
I don't wanna spend a lot
of time away from him.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.384
I wanna read him bedtime stories.

07:30.384 --> 07:32.825
I wanna play a massive
part in his upbringing.

07:32.825 --> 07:34.263
- [Female] It won't fit you.

07:34.263 --> 07:36.410
- I know yeah, it's for my little son.

07:36.410 --> 07:38.134
He's only 10 months so he's got time

07:38.134 --> 07:39.357
to grow into it hasn't he?

07:39.357 --> 07:40.464
- [Female] Oh yeah.

07:40.464 --> 07:42.287
- It will be nice to see
them and I'm sure I'm gonna

07:42.287 --> 07:44.892
come up with some plan or
strategy to get in there,

07:44.892 --> 07:46.475
under the hunters' noses,

07:46.475 --> 07:48.520
I think that's more than achievable.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.013
I'm gonna get him that.

07:50.013 --> 07:52.478
- [Male] I'm sure he'll
appreciate his present.

07:52.478 --> 07:53.934
- Nice one, thank you very much.

07:53.934 --> 07:54.767
Cheers.

07:59.126 --> 08:03.063
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the sacrifices we make.

08:03.063 --> 08:06.265
Today, for the first time in his life,

08:06.265 --> 08:09.812
Steve Hersey is celebrating father's day,

08:09.812 --> 08:12.291
but he's here catching fugitives.

08:12.291 --> 08:15.131
And on that very note, today will be

08:15.131 --> 08:17.798
Matt Mason's first father's day.

08:19.427 --> 08:21.699
- I just wonder how it's changing him,

08:21.699 --> 08:25.329
'cause he's such a independent person.

08:25.329 --> 08:28.329
But having a kid changes everything.

08:29.951 --> 08:33.151
- You just have to look
at one of these pictures

08:33.151 --> 08:35.862
and you can see the
devotion to the little boy.

08:35.862 --> 08:37.297
- Really protective.

08:37.297 --> 08:39.880
- I think here we've
got his achilles heel.

08:39.880 --> 08:44.188
This is not a man who's going
to stay away from his family.

08:44.188 --> 08:49.021
- If he gets to see his child,
I will be hugely irritated.

08:55.841 --> 08:59.591
- Suns out, what could
go possibly wrong, eh?

09:00.437 --> 09:04.233
- [Narrator] Matt has completed
his route through Wales.

09:04.233 --> 09:07.089
- You can see in the far
distance across the water,

09:07.089 --> 09:09.404
that's where I'm gonna meet my wife,

09:09.404 --> 09:11.680
see my little boy.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.902
- [Narrator] He's now
close to the home of his

09:13.902 --> 09:18.573
brother and sister-in-law,
Duncan and Rachel Cox.

09:18.573 --> 09:22.887
- The main focus of today is
getting to my brother-in-law

09:22.887 --> 09:24.449
to chat about how we could potentially

09:24.449 --> 09:26.728
set up a meeting with my wife and son.

09:26.728 --> 09:28.394
I know where I'm gonna meet him.

09:28.394 --> 09:30.191
We arranged a verbal meet,

09:30.191 --> 09:33.351
so there's no digital footprint there.

09:33.351 --> 09:35.291
- [Narrator] Knowing his
brother-in-law Duncan

09:35.291 --> 09:37.512
is attending an event at a local hotel,

09:37.512 --> 09:41.268
Matt's made a plan to meet him there.

09:41.268 --> 09:43.858
- So he's approaching now.

09:43.858 --> 09:46.019
I'm happy there's no one.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.602
I can't see anyone.

09:51.730 --> 09:53.439
How you doing man?
- How you doing?

09:53.439 --> 09:54.657
- Pretty good mate, how are you?

09:54.657 --> 09:55.960
So mate, is there gonna be a chance

09:55.960 --> 09:57.567
for me to meet Lindsay tonight?

09:57.567 --> 09:58.804
- If you want to do something

09:58.804 --> 10:00.083
it needs to be at the monument.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.571
- All right cool mate.

10:02.571 --> 10:04.736
- [Narrator] Having agreed for the meet

10:04.736 --> 10:06.903
to be at a local monument,

10:08.113 --> 10:11.845
Duncan drops Matt off at a
farm two miles from his house.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.098
- Cheers mate.

10:13.098 --> 10:17.849
- [Narrator] Before leaving
to tell Lindsay the plan.

10:17.849 --> 10:19.685
- It's a big score against the hunters.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.229
It's showing them that actually

10:21.229 --> 10:22.640
if I wanna meet my wife and son

10:22.640 --> 10:25.095
we can make that happen.

10:25.095 --> 10:27.384
Ultimately it sends the message that

10:27.384 --> 10:29.301
they're not in control.

10:36.061 --> 10:39.103
- We've got this assessed
route that we think he's on.

10:39.103 --> 10:41.710
- [Narrator] After accessing
Matt's search history,

10:41.710 --> 10:46.365
HQ uncovered a planned route
through Wales into England.

10:46.365 --> 10:48.307
- If he's coming in this direction,

10:48.307 --> 10:50.104
puts himself into this area.

10:50.104 --> 10:51.335
- In Gloucester?

10:51.335 --> 10:53.260
- [Female] Yeah this is Gloucester, yeah.

10:53.260 --> 10:56.409
- [Peter] Who do we know
that lives in and around

10:56.409 --> 10:59.223
that area that he might rely upon?

10:59.223 --> 11:02.806
- If you look in terms
of who lives nearby,

11:03.876 --> 11:04.883
Rachel Cox.

11:04.883 --> 11:06.105
- Sister-in-law.

11:06.105 --> 11:08.856
Duncan Thompson, Rachel Cox's partner.

11:08.856 --> 11:10.806
We know that Lindsay spends all her time

11:10.806 --> 11:12.338
at her sisters, don't we?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.643
It's too much of a coincidence.

11:14.643 --> 11:17.257
- Is this movement indicative of Mason

11:17.257 --> 11:19.498
going towards the home address of Cox

11:19.498 --> 11:22.037
to see wife and baby, Lindsay and Harry?

11:22.037 --> 11:25.761
- We've got nothing else
to go on, so go for it.

11:25.761 --> 11:26.717
- Hi Steven.

11:26.717 --> 11:28.552
We believe, we can't be for sure,

11:28.552 --> 11:30.556
we believe Mason, not far from Gloucester,

11:30.556 --> 11:33.065
generally towards Rachel Cox address.

11:33.065 --> 11:35.450
- Rachel Cox is about 30/35 minute drive

11:35.450 --> 11:36.858
from where you are.

11:36.858 --> 11:38.058
You lot spread out.

11:38.058 --> 11:40.479
Let's see if we can't
catch ourselves a marine.

11:40.479 --> 11:42.479
- Let's fucking do this.

11:49.684 --> 11:52.434
(horse whinnies)

11:53.363 --> 11:55.298
- I'm confident that
the hunters don't know

11:55.298 --> 11:57.999
where I am now because if
they did they would be here.

11:57.999 --> 12:00.837
I've been here long enough
for them to sweep in,

12:00.837 --> 12:03.083
trap me in this barn and get me,

12:03.083 --> 12:04.324
but they haven't.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.241
So I'm more than happy.

12:09.472 --> 12:10.424
- Hi Steve.

12:10.424 --> 12:13.127
- [Male] We've just reached
Rachel and Duncan's address.

12:13.127 --> 12:15.928
- [Male] Let's have a look.

12:15.928 --> 12:19.694
- [Male] Look for any curtain twitches.

12:19.694 --> 12:21.788
(doorbell ringing)

12:21.788 --> 12:24.120
- [Male] I don't really
see no movement, you?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.236
- [Male] Negative.

12:25.236 --> 12:26.698
No one's in mate.

12:26.698 --> 12:29.938
- I can't see Matt Mason
going to Cox's address.

12:29.938 --> 12:32.356
I think he would be far enough aware that

12:32.356 --> 12:34.021
he can sit and watch.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.574
- [Peter] So we'll focus on
the surrounding area, shall we?

12:36.574 --> 12:38.737
- We just need to make sure that we check

12:38.737 --> 12:40.315
all buildings and outbuildings,

12:40.315 --> 12:41.706
just to cover all our bases.

12:41.706 --> 12:42.864
- Right, let's go.

12:42.864 --> 12:44.447
Move out, move out.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.382
- Like a million places to hide.

12:49.382 --> 12:51.545
- It's a guessing game
at the moment, this,

12:51.545 --> 12:55.763
but we're gonna go with it,
until we can rule it out.

12:55.763 --> 12:57.754
- See what happens if we shake the tree.

12:57.754 --> 13:02.140
- Let's get over here and
clear these properties.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.544
Where would he be?

13:03.544 --> 13:06.612
If he was hiding, where would he be?

13:06.612 --> 13:07.847
(dog barks)

13:07.847 --> 13:09.847
There goes the surprise.

13:13.878 --> 13:16.045
- Hear a few funny noises.

13:17.936 --> 13:18.769
Hello?

13:21.088 --> 13:24.921
- This would be the
perfect place to hide out.

13:28.069 --> 13:31.068
Let's have a look round here.

13:31.068 --> 13:31.901
- Hello?

13:44.130 --> 13:46.163
There's a little doorway down there.

13:46.163 --> 13:47.486
- [Female] What, round that side?

13:47.486 --> 13:48.366
- [Female] Yeah.

13:48.366 --> 13:50.116
- [Narrator] Matt is waiting to rendezvous

13:50.116 --> 13:51.505
with his wife Lindsay.

13:51.505 --> 13:54.505
Ground hunters are combing the area.

13:57.019 --> 14:00.172
- Just have a look round here.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.422
- [Matt] Hello?

14:02.499 --> 14:03.365
- Matt.

14:03.365 --> 14:04.816
- [Matt] Ah fucking hell, ey up mate.

14:04.816 --> 14:05.664
- All right mate.

14:05.664 --> 14:07.183
Yeah slight change of plan.

14:07.183 --> 14:08.724
- Well he aint in there.

14:08.724 --> 14:09.628
- Clear.

14:09.628 --> 14:11.809
- We've just searched
most of the outbuildings.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.200
There's no movement.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.845
- We just need to make sure every single

14:14.845 --> 14:16.478
building there's been checked.

14:16.478 --> 14:19.045
He's in that area somewhere,
so just keep doing it,

14:19.045 --> 14:21.182
keep doing it, keep doing it.

14:21.182 --> 14:22.539
- All received.

14:22.539 --> 14:25.130
- I'm thinking of getting
the drone to that location.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.905
- [Peter] Drone's on its way.

14:27.905 --> 14:29.493
- Yeah, slight change of plan.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.103
Lindsay's not gonna be down here til 10.

14:31.103 --> 14:31.936
- Tonight?

14:31.936 --> 14:32.769
- 10 tonight.

14:32.769 --> 14:34.326
- Is Lindsay gonna be on her own is she?

14:34.326 --> 14:35.500
- Lindsay'll be on her own.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.737
I'll bring you the car
but I've gotta just...

14:36.737 --> 14:38.778
- Right, okay, cool.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.798
Hopefully I'll see my wife tonight.

14:40.798 --> 14:42.073
Not gonna see Herry.

14:42.073 --> 14:45.614
Bit gutted but looking
forward to giving my wife

14:45.614 --> 14:47.911
a big squeeze, passing
over Herry's present

14:47.911 --> 14:50.720
and sticking one to the hunters.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.092
(light melodic music)

14:54.092 --> 14:56.098
- [Harry] Stinging nettles everywhere.

14:56.098 --> 14:57.711
Ow.

14:57.711 --> 14:58.544
Ow.

15:01.424 --> 15:02.942
Frank, wait.

15:02.942 --> 15:03.775
Ow.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.613
- Lazy bunch of hunters.

15:06.613 --> 15:08.291
They like their cars and helicopters

15:08.291 --> 15:10.973
and they don't like
being on foot too much.

15:10.973 --> 15:13.358
So hopefully we're gonna out trick 'em

15:13.358 --> 15:15.409
by going back to the old fashioned way,

15:15.409 --> 15:18.401
using our legs we were given.

15:18.401 --> 15:20.537
- [Narrator] Brothers Harry and Frank

15:20.537 --> 15:24.059
have so far hiked over 100 miles.

15:24.059 --> 15:26.203
- We were very different children.

15:26.203 --> 15:28.545
Frank basically lives outdoors.

15:28.545 --> 15:31.395
- [Frank] Harry cares
about like moisturizing

15:31.395 --> 15:33.389
and loves social media.

15:33.389 --> 15:36.063
- Frank doesn't even know
how to work an iPhone.

15:36.063 --> 15:37.318
- I do, I've got an iPhone.

15:37.318 --> 15:39.985
- Yeah but you don't know how to work it.

15:39.985 --> 15:40.902
Ah my legs.

15:43.141 --> 15:44.397
Woo.

15:44.397 --> 15:47.247
(laughing)

15:47.247 --> 15:48.080
Ow.

15:48.921 --> 15:50.588
Can someone help me?

15:52.117 --> 15:53.680
- [Frank] You all right?

15:53.680 --> 15:54.600
- No.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.785
My backpack was too heavy and I fell back.

15:57.785 --> 15:58.618
Oh fuck.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.563
If I nearly died there...

16:03.686 --> 16:06.147
- Harry being the youngest,
I take it upon myself

16:06.147 --> 16:09.397
to make sure I help him out when I can.

16:10.304 --> 16:14.864
- I'm not the person on
paper to go outdoors hiking.

16:14.864 --> 16:18.836
My mum wouldn't believe I'm
doing this, that's for sure.

16:18.836 --> 16:21.038
- He was young when my mum died,

16:21.038 --> 16:23.223
he was young when dad died.

16:23.223 --> 16:25.686
I'm only three years older
but whatever I'm feeling

16:25.686 --> 16:28.796
I think it must be a damn site
worse for him being younger.

16:28.796 --> 16:31.104
My dad, he used to come
into my school assembly

16:31.104 --> 16:33.760
and shout my name out and
said he needed a word with me.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.773
He was well embarrassing yeah.

16:35.773 --> 16:37.623
They were my worst memories at the time

16:37.623 --> 16:39.433
but looking back, yeah,
they're probably the best ones.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.979
- They're the ones you
remember the most as well,

16:40.979 --> 16:41.812
aren't they?

16:41.812 --> 16:43.521
- Yeah the funny ones.

16:43.521 --> 16:45.120
- [Harry] Is this where we're camping?

16:45.120 --> 16:46.074
- Good for me.

16:46.074 --> 16:47.611
You're all right Harry, it's fine.

16:47.611 --> 16:49.615
You're with me, you aint
on your own are you?

16:49.615 --> 16:51.258
- Okay.

16:51.258 --> 16:54.985
Frank's definitely more
of the father role to me.

16:54.985 --> 16:56.235
All the way in.

16:57.336 --> 16:58.427
- Good lad.

16:58.427 --> 17:01.301
- He has taken that on
since he was about 18.

17:01.301 --> 17:04.377
And he took on dad's business
from a very young age.

17:04.377 --> 17:06.429
- That's me done.

17:06.429 --> 17:07.762
Harry in a tent.

17:08.968 --> 17:11.578
- It's not my ideal place to pitch up

17:11.578 --> 17:14.078
but beggars can't be choosers.

17:18.220 --> 17:19.658
Are you a parking ticket?

17:19.658 --> 17:23.988
Because you have got fine
written all over you.

17:23.988 --> 17:26.427
- [Narrator] HQ have
investigated the brothers'

17:26.427 --> 17:28.791
online presence and gained access

17:28.791 --> 17:31.296
to Harry's social media accounts.

17:31.296 --> 17:34.118
- Just looking through his photos here.

17:34.118 --> 17:36.045
He looks very outgoing.

17:36.045 --> 17:39.871
He's quite a flamboyant
personality by the look of it.

17:39.871 --> 17:42.530
But Frank doesn't have
any social media profile.

17:42.530 --> 17:45.179
No Facebook, no Twitter, no nothing.

17:45.179 --> 17:49.176
Seems to lead a very different
kinda life than Harry does.

17:49.176 --> 17:52.889
He inherited a campsite
from the father who died.

17:52.889 --> 17:54.450
- [Female] I think that
their mum might have

17:54.450 --> 17:55.750
passed away as well.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.044
- [Female] That's the
mum and the dad, right?

17:57.044 --> 17:58.127
- Yeah.

17:58.127 --> 18:00.414
- These boys have gone on the run

18:00.414 --> 18:04.566
just four months after
they've lost their mother.

18:04.566 --> 18:08.486
There's no doubt that these
two are doing it for mum,

18:08.486 --> 18:11.999
and that emotional
drive will act as a bond

18:11.999 --> 18:14.046
between the two I'm sure.

18:14.046 --> 18:17.875
But it gives the whole
experience an added intensity

18:17.875 --> 18:21.833
that I think probably lead to problems.

18:21.833 --> 18:24.583
- [Frank] Come on Harry, keep up.

18:27.769 --> 18:30.473
- [Harry] I'm just tired of walking.

18:30.473 --> 18:34.063
- Harry's tired, we've
walked a long way today.

18:34.063 --> 18:35.980
Morale's down big time.

18:40.688 --> 18:43.254
(gunshots)

18:43.254 --> 18:44.087
Gunshots.

18:45.936 --> 18:46.994
- What?

18:46.994 --> 18:47.911
- Gunshots.

18:50.474 --> 18:52.087
(gunshot)

18:52.087 --> 18:53.372
Are we all right to sit
down for five minutes mate?

18:53.372 --> 18:54.520
- You can sit round there.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.993
- Top man yeah, thank you.

18:55.993 --> 18:58.243
(gunshots)

18:59.755 --> 19:01.626
All right Harry?

19:01.626 --> 19:03.008
- [Harry] I'm fine.

19:03.008 --> 19:04.870
- [Frank] It's getting a bit emotional.

19:04.870 --> 19:08.780
- I don't know, it just gives
you time to think doesn't it?

19:08.780 --> 19:09.947
- Yeah I know.

19:13.490 --> 19:15.706
- Mum only died in the last four months,

19:15.706 --> 19:17.718
but even dad, what five years ago,

19:17.718 --> 19:19.968
it's all still quite fresh.

19:22.566 --> 19:24.651
- Mum was diagnosed with dementia,

19:24.651 --> 19:27.308
she was young, and within
three years it killed her.

19:27.308 --> 19:30.102
My dad was more of a shock.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.872
He was fit and healthy.

19:31.872 --> 19:35.872
We found at home dead
with a heart attack at 55.

19:36.952 --> 19:39.353
You aint gotta be tough all the time.

19:39.353 --> 19:42.671
It's all right to let
it out now and again.

19:42.671 --> 19:43.522
- It's hard.

19:43.522 --> 19:44.829
- [Frank] Yeah it is hard.

19:44.829 --> 19:47.780
Nothing in life comes easy mate.

19:47.780 --> 19:50.951
Nothing worth having comes easy anyway.

19:50.951 --> 19:53.736
- I'm going on the run
to challenge myself.

19:53.736 --> 19:55.677
We've had a bit of a shit year,

19:55.677 --> 19:57.789
but we always say, us Savages,

19:57.789 --> 19:59.930
we don't give up no matter what.

19:59.930 --> 20:02.430
That's a family trait of ours.

20:03.396 --> 20:05.465
Do you know what, we better make it

20:05.465 --> 20:07.965
to the fucking end after this.

20:16.659 --> 20:19.326
- I've got a good vantage point.

20:19.326 --> 20:21.659
Hunters don't know I'm here.

20:22.672 --> 20:25.067
- [Narrator] Matt has arrived
at the rendezvous point

20:25.067 --> 20:27.465
to meet with his wife, close to the home

20:27.465 --> 20:30.132
of his sister-in-law Rachel Cox.

20:31.482 --> 20:34.379
- My missus now is probably not too happy,

20:34.379 --> 20:37.856
you know, and Dunc is running
around like a blue-ass fly,

20:37.856 --> 20:39.916
but it's not me against the hunters

20:39.916 --> 20:43.416
it's me and my family against the hunters.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.750
- Ooh, we have had a bit of activity.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.397
Lindsay Mason's phone.

20:48.397 --> 20:49.648
- Where is this?

20:49.648 --> 20:53.712
- Not too far from Rachel Cox
and Duncan Thompson's house.

20:53.712 --> 20:54.879
- Yes!

20:54.879 --> 20:56.869
- [Male] Something's brewing down there.

20:56.869 --> 20:58.013
What do you think?

20:58.013 --> 20:59.901
- [Peter] I don't think
it's a coincidence.

20:59.901 --> 21:02.040
- He's having some contact and he's gonna

21:02.040 --> 21:03.788
see his wife and see his kid.

21:03.788 --> 21:05.016
- It makes sense.

21:05.016 --> 21:05.849
- Yeah.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.668
Right, we've got a drone down there.

21:07.668 --> 21:09.395
Get him to get the most
appropriate lens on

21:09.395 --> 21:10.895
and have a fly by.

21:15.329 --> 21:17.460
- [Jason] Are you picking
this feed up live?

21:17.460 --> 21:18.329
Over.

21:18.329 --> 21:19.324
- Yeah, received.

21:19.324 --> 21:20.541
We can see it, thank you.

21:20.541 --> 21:22.485
- Hopefully flush Matt Mason out.

21:22.485 --> 21:24.541
(dramatic music)

21:24.541 --> 21:29.374
- [Narrator] HQ launch the
drone to search the local area.

21:30.786 --> 21:32.688
- Two people there.

21:32.688 --> 21:34.271
Three people there.

21:35.517 --> 21:37.976
- [Narrator] Ground hunters
are poised to move in

21:37.976 --> 21:39.929
if a positive ID is made.

21:39.929 --> 21:41.832
- There's one person on the right.

21:41.832 --> 21:43.053
One person with a dog.

21:43.053 --> 21:45.052
- Someone in the field by the looks of it.

21:45.052 --> 21:47.802
(dramatic music)

21:49.093 --> 21:51.260
- That looks like a drone.

21:57.763 --> 22:02.172
We're just gonna stroll
off, nice and easy.

22:02.172 --> 22:04.568
No it's still up there now.

22:04.568 --> 22:06.404
We're taking a nice stroll.

22:06.404 --> 22:08.334
- [Female] Doesn't look
like a fugitive does it?

22:08.334 --> 22:11.710
- Let's try and get a bit
closer, just give me a second.

22:11.710 --> 22:13.474
- The drone's following us.

22:13.474 --> 22:15.851
That big fucking forest over there.

22:15.851 --> 22:17.946
Straight in there.

22:17.946 --> 22:20.049
Shit's just got real.

22:20.049 --> 22:20.882
Bastards.

22:28.395 --> 22:29.833
(dramatic music)

22:29.833 --> 22:32.626
- [Jason] I'm getting closer.

22:32.626 --> 22:35.517
- Feeling a little bit
confused if I'm honest,

22:35.517 --> 22:39.434
because they're not gonna
know where I've been.

22:42.262 --> 22:44.593
- [Narrator] Matt Mason's
plan to meet his wife

22:44.593 --> 22:47.553
has been disrupted by a drone.

22:47.553 --> 22:50.304
- [Jason] I can't see
under the treeline, over.

22:50.304 --> 22:51.150
- Yes yes.

22:51.150 --> 22:52.967
How much flying time
have you got left Jason?

22:52.967 --> 22:54.357
- We've got about eight minutes left

22:54.357 --> 22:56.024
on the current batteries, over.

22:56.024 --> 22:58.774
(dramatic music)

23:00.569 --> 23:04.319
- This is a risk that
I'm, that I wanna take.

23:05.533 --> 23:07.479
- Okay drone is returning Zoe.

23:07.479 --> 23:10.090
Gonna bring the drone
back to us for change.

23:10.090 --> 23:12.101
- [Zoe] Obviously losing light now.

23:12.101 --> 23:14.518
- This is really frustrating.

23:16.885 --> 23:18.421
- [Matt] I haven't heard
anything of the drone

23:18.421 --> 23:19.838
for five minutes.

23:23.747 --> 23:26.070
- [Narrator] Matt's waiting
to intercept Lindsay

23:26.070 --> 23:29.175
at a footpath leading to the monument.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.421
- I'm in a really well concealed spot

23:31.421 --> 23:34.197
overlooking the main path.

23:34.197 --> 23:35.649
We're covered from the air,

23:35.649 --> 23:37.861
especially with the light dropping.

23:37.861 --> 23:39.736
I'm fully confident that if the hunters

23:39.736 --> 23:41.975
were 20 minutes to me right,

23:41.975 --> 23:45.892
they would not have a
Scooby-Doo that I'm here.

23:50.531 --> 23:52.937
I just hope that they're
not tailing my missus

23:52.937 --> 23:54.521
because she won't come,

23:54.521 --> 23:57.521
and all this will have been in vain.

23:59.026 --> 24:01.484
It's the sound of shoes.

24:01.484 --> 24:04.484
(suspenseful music)

24:06.960 --> 24:08.498
(whistles)

24:08.498 --> 24:09.331
My missus.

24:10.461 --> 24:11.461
- Oh my God.

24:12.667 --> 24:13.596
- Ssh.

24:13.596 --> 24:14.873
Come on, come on.

24:14.873 --> 24:16.364
How are we doing?

24:16.364 --> 24:17.531
Give us a hug.

24:20.961 --> 24:22.147
How you doing?

24:22.147 --> 24:23.230
- Really bad.

24:25.123 --> 24:26.555
- Was you being followed?

24:26.555 --> 24:27.894
- No, no.

24:27.894 --> 24:30.098
- [Narrator] Lindsay's
used a friend's car,

24:30.098 --> 24:33.587
unknown to the hunters,
to travel to the forest.

24:33.587 --> 24:35.277
- They bugged my phone.

24:35.277 --> 24:37.224
They've put a tracker on the car.

24:37.224 --> 24:39.474
- Go this way, go this way.

24:41.333 --> 24:42.922
- We're shitting a brick.

24:42.922 --> 24:43.871
Swear to God.

24:43.871 --> 24:46.976
Because they have been on
us like I have no tomorrow,

24:46.976 --> 24:48.460
because they're waiting for us to fuck up

24:48.460 --> 24:50.068
'cause they know you won't.

24:50.068 --> 24:51.209
- Brilliant, how's Herry?

24:51.209 --> 24:52.042
Oh.

24:52.042 --> 24:52.888
- He's really good.

24:52.888 --> 24:54.721
- I've got him summat.

24:56.569 --> 24:59.482
It's a little bit big,
but he can grow into it.

24:59.482 --> 25:00.561
- I love it.

25:00.561 --> 25:03.422
- Right, give a big hug
to Herry for me all right?

25:03.422 --> 25:04.304
- Okay.

25:04.304 --> 25:07.082
- All right, I'll see you in 12 days.

25:07.082 --> 25:07.915
- All right.

25:07.915 --> 25:08.831
- All right, have a good'un.

25:08.831 --> 25:10.248
See you in a bit.

25:15.488 --> 25:17.321
My family are amazing.

25:20.122 --> 25:21.789
They are incredible.

25:23.910 --> 25:26.221
We're back on now, we're back in the game,

25:26.221 --> 25:28.471
we're back in it to win it.

25:36.066 --> 25:37.704
(groaning)

25:37.704 --> 25:40.056
- There's water in my fucking shoe.

25:40.056 --> 25:41.543
Oh no.

25:41.543 --> 25:43.207
Foot is drenched.

25:43.207 --> 25:45.595
- Right, it is very wet there,

25:45.595 --> 25:48.243
so what you wanna do is
stand on these reeds.

25:48.243 --> 25:50.830
- [Ismail] Oh my days.

25:50.830 --> 25:52.506
- [Nathanael] By the end of this

25:52.506 --> 25:53.872
I'm gonna call you wet foot.

25:53.872 --> 25:54.968
- [Ismail] Wet foot?

25:54.968 --> 25:56.416
It sounds so derogatory.

25:56.416 --> 25:58.323
(laughing)

25:58.323 --> 26:00.546
- [Narrator] Best friends
and recent graduates

26:00.546 --> 26:03.653
Nate and Ish are staying
off the hunters' radar

26:03.653 --> 26:04.986
by wild camping.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.769
- We've known each other for seven years,

26:08.769 --> 26:11.942
since we both studied
architecture at Huddersfield.

26:11.942 --> 26:13.420
- We're like brothers.

26:13.420 --> 26:14.915
I call his mum auntie.

26:14.915 --> 26:17.282
I call his sisters like my older sisters.

26:17.282 --> 26:20.775
- I have actually got your mum
saved in my phone as mum#2.

26:20.775 --> 26:22.016
(laughing)

26:22.016 --> 26:25.766
- All that wet stuff,
isn't that spider eggs?

26:28.306 --> 26:31.123
- No please tell me, I
have a serious phobia.

26:31.123 --> 26:34.669
We need to find a path and
we stay the freak on it.

26:34.669 --> 26:36.960
- One of our friends
starting calling us Nish.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.763
Nate and Ish.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.773
Nish.

26:39.773 --> 26:41.835
It sounds like we're in a relationship.

26:41.835 --> 26:43.792
No we are not a couple.

26:43.792 --> 26:46.347
- Yeah, we're not a couple.

26:46.347 --> 26:48.255
- Look at that fog.

26:48.255 --> 26:50.345
- It's a key point in our lives where

26:50.345 --> 26:52.494
we've been through the education system,

26:52.494 --> 26:54.725
we're right at the end,
we're about to start,

26:54.725 --> 26:56.441
really kick off our careers.

26:56.441 --> 26:58.024
- Can you see that?

26:58.867 --> 27:01.832
- 50 grand would be life changing.

27:01.832 --> 27:05.387
50 grand will take care
of like university debts.

27:05.387 --> 27:07.104
This looks good.

27:07.104 --> 27:09.441
- Do you know what, five grand right now

27:09.441 --> 27:11.358
would be life changing.

27:15.243 --> 27:17.105
- [Peter] Nathanael and Ismail.

27:17.105 --> 27:18.727
What do we know about them?

27:18.727 --> 27:20.449
Who are the known associates that

27:20.449 --> 27:22.008
they're gonna reach out to?

27:22.008 --> 27:23.871
- They've got a broad
network of individuals

27:23.871 --> 27:25.977
that they've met through the
University of Huddersfield.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.601
- Apparently they're really into gym,

27:27.601 --> 27:30.371
and they're all gym boys,
into their football.

27:30.371 --> 27:32.846
- Bank records seem to show they probably

27:32.846 --> 27:35.743
live beyond their means,
it would appear they are

27:35.743 --> 27:37.446
in quite a lot of student debt.

27:37.446 --> 27:38.279
- Right.

27:38.279 --> 27:39.390
Do we exploit this?

27:39.390 --> 27:41.145
We've got to, it's our open goal innit?

27:41.145 --> 27:43.625
- Just to pop them up,
let's freeze their accounts.

27:43.625 --> 27:44.723
- Oh yes please.

27:44.723 --> 27:46.381
We'll strategically block their accounts,

27:46.381 --> 27:47.784
so it can cause them to reach out

27:47.784 --> 27:49.014
to ask other people for help,

27:49.014 --> 27:50.035
'cause as soon as they do that,

27:50.035 --> 27:51.594
that throws up leads for us.

27:51.594 --> 27:52.921
Always playing games,

27:52.921 --> 27:56.647
you've just gotta be the better player.

27:56.647 --> 27:58.483
(groaning)

27:58.483 --> 28:00.816
- [Ismail] Oh for fuck sake.

28:02.117 --> 28:04.324
I mean this is just ridiculous.

28:04.324 --> 28:05.432
- Oh my days.

28:05.432 --> 28:07.646
I slept til 1:00 a.m. beautifully.

28:07.646 --> 28:10.012
When I was woken I was soaking wet

28:10.012 --> 28:12.169
and so was my sleeping bag,

28:12.169 --> 28:16.223
and I looked up and I was
like what the hell is that?

28:16.223 --> 28:17.811
What am I looking at?

28:17.811 --> 28:19.662
And it was the mountains.

28:19.662 --> 28:21.049
(laughing)

28:21.049 --> 28:24.480
My roof had come off,
everything was drenched.

28:24.480 --> 28:25.730
It's just nuts.

28:27.550 --> 28:31.383
- It's been a few days
of walking and camping.

28:32.868 --> 28:35.634
I'm soaking wet through, I'm aching,

28:35.634 --> 28:37.881
I've slept with a rock in my back,

28:37.881 --> 28:41.655
and to be honest I just
wanna find some buildings.

28:41.655 --> 28:44.643
- [Narrator] Nate and Ish
are abandoning wild camping

28:44.643 --> 28:47.861
and heading to the nearest B&B.

28:47.861 --> 28:49.821
- So we've got a two mile hike,

28:49.821 --> 28:52.582
which at the end of it will be hopefully

28:52.582 --> 28:55.249
some help to get us dry and fed.

28:58.336 --> 29:00.726
- [Narrator] The six
remaining fugitives are

29:00.726 --> 29:02.360
scattered around the country,

29:02.360 --> 29:06.096
staying off grid in their
bid to evade the hunters.

29:06.096 --> 29:08.670
Having walked for miles
through Derbyshire,

29:08.670 --> 29:12.337
Frank and Harry are
resting up in Doveridge.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.862
(gunshot)

29:16.862 --> 29:20.142
- Shotguns, bacon sarnies and cups of tea.

29:20.142 --> 29:21.831
Bless you, you're an absolute diamond.

29:21.831 --> 29:23.415
Best woman I've met all the trip this is.

29:23.415 --> 29:27.279
- Probably be the only one that's why.

29:27.279 --> 29:28.946
- [Harry] Thanks Jo.

29:30.969 --> 29:33.234
- [Narrator] Days of
hiking and camping off grid

29:33.234 --> 29:36.728
have taken their toll on student Harry.

29:36.728 --> 29:38.940
- You feeling better, yeah?

29:38.940 --> 29:41.633
Stuff's got heavy, it's
catching up on Harry I think.

29:41.633 --> 29:43.093
But it's understandable.

29:43.093 --> 29:45.203
I mean he's walked a hell of a long way,

29:45.203 --> 29:48.321
he's got bad feet, he's been bitten badly,

29:48.321 --> 29:53.321
and I think he's feeling sorry
for himself a little bit.

29:53.573 --> 29:56.941
So the plan is we wanna get out of here,

29:56.941 --> 29:59.253
start making our way home.

29:59.253 --> 30:01.071
We wanna be around our area.

30:01.071 --> 30:04.388
Hopefully we get through this
hurdle and he'll be all right,

30:04.388 --> 30:07.106
we'll come out the other side.

30:07.106 --> 30:10.035
- [Narrator] Keen to take his
brother to home territory,

30:10.035 --> 30:13.532
Frank has a plan to misdirect the hunters.

30:13.532 --> 30:14.788
(gunshot)

30:14.788 --> 30:16.688
- [Frank] I'm gonna make a video.

30:16.688 --> 30:18.467
We'll post it to Bleksley.

30:18.467 --> 30:19.585
- [Male] Fire.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.067
- The hunters are obviously gonna

30:21.067 --> 30:22.680
track the email and find this place,

30:22.680 --> 30:24.352
by which time we'll be long out of here.

30:24.352 --> 30:25.852
- And again, fire.

30:26.920 --> 30:29.027
- [Frank] Happy hunting Peter.

30:29.027 --> 30:30.381
- Happy hunting!

30:30.381 --> 30:32.798
- Catch me if you can, Peter.

30:34.197 --> 30:37.066
- [Narrator] Frank and Harry
have enlisted manager Jo

30:37.066 --> 30:39.818
to get them out of the immediate area.

30:39.818 --> 30:41.883
- Jo, what will you do if the hunters come

30:41.883 --> 30:43.855
to investigate the club and you?

30:43.855 --> 30:45.795
- I will deny even seeing you.

30:45.795 --> 30:48.279
- Jo will tell 'em to piss off.

30:48.279 --> 30:51.546
So we're gonna get a
lift off Jo's son in law.

30:51.546 --> 30:53.209
- Put your bags in the boot.

30:53.209 --> 30:54.722
- [Harry] It feels good to know

30:54.722 --> 30:56.284
that we're aiming to get home.

30:56.284 --> 30:58.892
- If they're onto us now
we're gonna keep pushing on.

30:58.892 --> 31:02.370
Expect the worst, hope for the best.

31:02.370 --> 31:04.304
- Chief, we've got a message.

31:04.304 --> 31:05.360
It's a video.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.193
- Right.

31:08.642 --> 31:10.371
- Hi Peter, it's Frank.

31:10.371 --> 31:13.240
We're way on target and
you're well off the mark.

31:13.240 --> 31:17.730
- [Ben] He's taken a while to
come up with that one liner.

31:17.730 --> 31:18.914
- [Female] Miss.

31:18.914 --> 31:19.792
Miss.

31:19.792 --> 31:21.480
- Happy hunting Peter.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.874
- Happy hunting.

31:22.874 --> 31:23.970
- [Steve] That's Harry.

31:23.970 --> 31:25.961
- Couldn't hit a cow's arse with a banjo.

31:25.961 --> 31:27.748
- [Ben] What do you
think about that Steve?

31:27.748 --> 31:31.415
- I would definitely
find out where that is.

31:33.104 --> 31:35.480
So this sign here, that's quite prominent,

31:35.480 --> 31:36.542
garden stand.

31:36.542 --> 31:38.924
Haven't really heard that term
before at a shooting range.

31:38.924 --> 31:42.003
Just literally doing a
image search on Google

31:42.003 --> 31:43.968
for garden stand shooting range,

31:43.968 --> 31:46.391
brings up this photo
here which actually says

31:46.391 --> 31:48.744
garden stand four, that
says garden stand two.

31:48.744 --> 31:50.985
It looks like pretty much the same sign,

31:50.985 --> 31:54.562
and this comes back to a site
for Doveridge Shooting Range.

31:54.562 --> 31:56.587
Looked it up on mapping.

31:56.587 --> 31:59.054
That's a stand, the garden stand.

31:59.054 --> 32:00.788
So it's definitely that site,

32:00.788 --> 32:02.760
so it's definitely taken in Doveridge.

32:02.760 --> 32:03.895
- Good work mate.

32:03.895 --> 32:05.390
- Yeah.

32:05.390 --> 32:07.612
- [Narrator] CCTV from the shooting range

32:07.612 --> 32:11.864
reveals both the fugitives
and their getaway vehicle.

32:11.864 --> 32:14.391
- [Female] The name of
the registered owner

32:14.391 --> 32:15.855
is Joanne Gilligan.

32:15.855 --> 32:18.252
That's the manager of the shooting range.

32:18.252 --> 32:19.764
- [Female] We're getting closer.

32:19.764 --> 32:21.145
- Hello guys.

32:21.145 --> 32:22.794
Joanne Gilligan.

32:22.794 --> 32:24.985
Basically we really need
to get in front of her

32:24.985 --> 32:26.573
and get as much as we possibly can.

32:26.573 --> 32:27.406
- [Female] Okay.

32:27.406 --> 32:28.463
- [Ben] That'd be great.

32:28.463 --> 32:29.370
- [Female] Cheers Ben.

32:29.370 --> 32:30.376
- See you in a bit, bye bye.

32:30.376 --> 32:31.626
- [Female] Bye.

32:35.645 --> 32:37.125
- [Male] Hi, are you Jo?

32:37.125 --> 32:38.208
- Yeah.

32:38.208 --> 32:41.147
- Jo, you met a couple of lads
down at the shooting range.

32:41.147 --> 32:42.028
- No.

32:42.028 --> 32:44.206
- [Male] You haven't met them?

32:44.206 --> 32:45.817
No one, no?
- No one.

32:45.817 --> 32:48.832
- [Female] I'd imagine that
you've sorted 'em out a lift.

32:48.832 --> 32:49.825
- Me?

32:49.825 --> 32:50.999
(laughing)

32:50.999 --> 32:52.535
- [Female] So that's a yes then.

32:52.535 --> 32:53.695
- [Jo] I won't tell ya.

32:53.695 --> 32:55.736
- [Female] Right, but you
did sort 'em out a lift.

32:55.736 --> 32:58.352
- Yeah but I'm not telling ya.

32:58.352 --> 33:00.103
- [Female] When they were here.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.186
- Yeah.

33:01.186 --> 33:03.362
You know they were here anyway don't ya?

33:03.362 --> 33:04.939
You know they were here.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.053
They were here.

33:06.053 --> 33:09.419
- [Female] So was it friends
or family that helped?

33:09.419 --> 33:10.720
Was it family?

33:10.720 --> 33:11.931
- My lips are sealed.

33:11.931 --> 33:13.695
I'm not telling ya.

33:13.695 --> 33:16.528
Truthfully, I'm not gonna give in.

33:18.260 --> 33:19.648
- [Female] Hi Ben.

33:19.648 --> 33:20.884
- [Ben] Hello there.

33:20.884 --> 33:23.755
- [Female] Long story short
the boys were definitely here.

33:23.755 --> 33:26.677
Jo's facilitated a lift out of the area.

33:26.677 --> 33:29.139
- So it's someone close to the family,

33:29.139 --> 33:32.150
whoever's driven 'em, but no way on Earth

33:32.150 --> 33:33.742
could we get that information out of her.

33:33.742 --> 33:35.202
- Okay, right.

33:35.202 --> 33:38.498
- Harry and Frank have
clearly done a very good job

33:38.498 --> 33:41.033
in persuading people to protect them.

33:41.033 --> 33:43.008
But we'll still catch them,

33:43.008 --> 33:45.468
because as soon as they make a mistake

33:45.468 --> 33:47.885
we'll be back on their trail.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.382
- That was horrible.

33:55.382 --> 33:57.557
I got soaked through completely.

33:57.557 --> 34:01.376
You just realize that you
are out of your depth.

34:01.376 --> 34:02.373
(laughs)

34:02.373 --> 34:04.456
Like nature is gonna win.

34:05.575 --> 34:07.871
I'm ready for breakfast.

34:07.871 --> 34:10.383
- [Narrator] After days of wild camping,

34:10.383 --> 34:12.839
best friends Nate and Ish are recovering

34:12.839 --> 34:14.698
at the Ladybower Inn.

34:14.698 --> 34:16.385
- [Female] Right, scrambled egg.

34:16.385 --> 34:18.156
- [Ismail] Yes please.

34:18.156 --> 34:19.358
Thank you.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.152
- I love mayonnaise.

34:21.152 --> 34:22.681
- I knew you were gonna
bring up the mayonnaise.

34:22.681 --> 34:23.917
- I have to bro.

34:23.917 --> 34:25.609
Do you have any mayo?

34:25.609 --> 34:26.442
- [Female] Mayo?

34:26.442 --> 34:27.884
- [Nathanael] Yeah.

34:27.884 --> 34:29.784
- [Ismail] Nathan's the
only person that I know

34:29.784 --> 34:31.572
who's ever put mayonnaise on a biscuit.

34:31.572 --> 34:33.115
- I did it to prove a point.

34:33.115 --> 34:34.193
- That's disgusting.

34:34.193 --> 34:36.811
- I don't just be putting
mayonnaise on biscuits.

34:36.811 --> 34:38.672
- [Female] Very strange meal.

34:38.672 --> 34:39.705
- Yeah it is.

34:39.705 --> 34:40.538
Thank you.

34:47.197 --> 34:48.313
- There y'are mate.

34:48.313 --> 34:49.313
- Thank you.

34:53.701 --> 34:56.201
Oh it says it's been declined.

34:57.398 --> 35:00.065
I'm gonna try that again please.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.327
- [Male] Still no dice?

35:03.327 --> 35:04.160
- No.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.838
Give me two seconds please mate.

35:06.838 --> 35:10.073
- Okay guys, in relation to Nate and Ish,

35:10.073 --> 35:12.596
use of bank card has been attempted

35:12.596 --> 35:14.355
at the following address.

35:14.355 --> 35:16.228
Ladybower Inn, Bamford.

35:16.228 --> 35:18.685
And the card was declined
'cause we froze the account.

35:18.685 --> 35:19.554
- Lovely.

35:19.554 --> 35:20.450
- Yes.

35:20.450 --> 35:21.441
- Nice one.

35:21.441 --> 35:23.997
- What's the nearest ground hunter team?

35:23.997 --> 35:25.412
- Ah, fuck sake.

35:25.412 --> 35:27.066
Resources were hours away.

35:27.066 --> 35:28.907
The good thing is we can rely on

35:28.907 --> 35:30.575
other technical data to point us

35:30.575 --> 35:31.835
in the right direction.

35:31.835 --> 35:33.664
So hopefully they're
fleeting out the area,

35:33.664 --> 35:36.851
disorganized, without a plan, confused,

35:36.851 --> 35:39.077
paranoid, tired, pissed off.

35:39.077 --> 35:40.571
- Ish.

35:40.571 --> 35:41.902
It's been declined.

35:41.902 --> 35:43.565
So they've blocked it.

35:43.565 --> 35:45.710
How much cash do you have?

35:45.710 --> 35:46.960
- [Ismail] 35.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.263
- You don't even have 40?

35:48.263 --> 35:50.544
- I've got five pound in coins.

35:50.544 --> 35:52.306
- Come come come come 'cause yeah,

35:52.306 --> 35:53.725
it's fucking ridiculous.

35:53.725 --> 35:55.308
- Just take it all.

35:57.284 --> 35:58.577
- That's 40 mate.

35:58.577 --> 36:00.160
- Cheers.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.437
- Sorry about that mate.

36:01.437 --> 36:02.270
Cheers.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.312
Oh my gosh.

36:05.211 --> 36:06.644
Blocking our cards.

36:06.644 --> 36:07.676
I'm angry.

36:07.676 --> 36:09.982
That is the worst thing you can do to me,

36:09.982 --> 36:11.419
let me try and pay for something

36:11.419 --> 36:12.693
and not have money to pay for it.

36:12.693 --> 36:13.631
- I hate it.

36:13.631 --> 36:15.191
These arseholes.

36:15.191 --> 36:17.613
- That there takes the biscuit.

36:17.613 --> 36:19.804
What are we gonna do?

36:19.804 --> 36:21.500
Ish, what we gonna do?

36:21.500 --> 36:23.583
What are we gonna do Ish?

36:33.217 --> 36:35.346
(tense music)

36:35.346 --> 36:37.069
- Drop you here champs, if that's okay.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.434
- Yeah, thank you.
- Nice one.

36:38.434 --> 36:40.336
- [Narrator] After HQ blocked their card,

36:40.336 --> 36:43.646
the fugitives have persuaded
B&B owner Shaun White

36:43.646 --> 36:46.702
to drive them to a nearby pub.

36:46.702 --> 36:47.535
- Thank you.

36:47.535 --> 36:49.251
Very much appreciate it.

36:49.251 --> 36:51.567
Let's do this, let's
get off the road mate.

36:51.567 --> 36:54.120
- [Narrator] They're trying
to get to Huddersfield,

36:54.120 --> 36:57.175
where they studied at university.

36:57.175 --> 36:58.553
- [Nathanael] Hiya.

36:58.553 --> 37:01.406
Do you have a phone I
can borrow by any chance?

37:01.406 --> 37:02.739
- [Female] Yeah.

37:04.308 --> 37:05.354
- [Female] Hiya.

37:05.354 --> 37:06.713
- Hiya, how long will it take for

37:06.713 --> 37:08.600
the taxi to get to Huddersfield?

37:08.600 --> 37:10.652
- [Female] It'll be
about 10 to 15 minutes.

37:10.652 --> 37:12.402
- Perfect, thank you.

37:14.502 --> 37:17.352
- [Narrator] The fugitives
have also called an associate,

37:17.352 --> 37:19.788
Dodie, who's agreed to pay their taxi fare

37:19.788 --> 37:21.944
to a gym where he trains.

37:21.944 --> 37:23.880
- Top Bodies, Huddersfield.

37:23.880 --> 37:24.797
We're good.

37:28.326 --> 37:31.631
- Failed transaction was
at the Ladybower Inn.

37:31.631 --> 37:35.381
- [Narrator] HQ are examining
technical data around the B&B,

37:35.381 --> 37:38.328
after Nate and Ish's
failed bank transaction,

37:38.328 --> 37:40.828
to try and find their getaway.

37:41.815 --> 37:44.320
- We've done a couple of
checks on the property,

37:44.320 --> 37:46.257
appears to be the owner-occupier

37:46.257 --> 37:47.910
is a guy called Shaun White.

37:47.910 --> 37:50.411
We've looked at his
historical cell records

37:50.411 --> 37:53.864
and he's done this journey
after the failed transaction,

37:53.864 --> 37:55.760
heading back towards Huddersfield,

37:55.760 --> 37:57.467
the university that they went to.

37:57.467 --> 37:58.441
- Ah.

37:58.441 --> 38:00.458
- [Narrator] Tracking Shaun's phone,

38:00.458 --> 38:02.921
the hunters suspect he
may have taken the boys

38:02.921 --> 38:04.522
halfway to Huddersfield.

38:04.522 --> 38:08.631
But they need to find the exact
location where he left them.

38:08.631 --> 38:10.709
- [Male] So I wanna know what's here.

38:10.709 --> 38:13.366
- [Male] There's a little
pub right by that last ping.

38:13.366 --> 38:15.142
- Ye Olde Mustard Pub.

38:15.142 --> 38:16.657
Ye olde fucker.

38:16.657 --> 38:20.099
Can we get some checks
on CCTV for that pub?

38:20.099 --> 38:22.196
- The requests are going in as we speak.

38:22.196 --> 38:27.029
- [Ben] If we can get that
onward movement we're laughing.

38:32.071 --> 38:34.275
- This is probably the happiest I've been.

38:34.275 --> 38:35.692
- [Nathanael] Thank you very much.

38:35.692 --> 38:36.978
- No problem, thank you.

38:36.978 --> 38:38.910
- [Narrator] Nate and Ish have made it

38:38.910 --> 38:42.883
to the refuge of a gym where
a friend, Dodie, trains.

38:42.883 --> 38:45.130
- I'm going to make myself comfortable.

38:45.130 --> 38:47.106
- Nate, why don't you do some legs?

38:47.106 --> 38:48.712
- [Nathanael] Because I've been walking

38:48.712 --> 38:50.917
for like 11 days, idiot.

38:50.917 --> 38:52.749
Why don't I do some legs?

38:52.749 --> 38:54.127
- [Ismail] Wow.

38:54.127 --> 38:55.151
Hey hey, hey hey.

38:55.151 --> 38:57.891
- Right, who can explain
to me what's going on?

38:57.891 --> 38:59.971
One of my regular customers just called

38:59.971 --> 39:01.718
he said, "Oh there's some guys in the gym

39:01.718 --> 39:03.426
"who I don't recognize."

39:03.426 --> 39:05.857
- [Narrator] Gym owner John
Froud has been tipped off

39:05.857 --> 39:09.062
that strangers are in his premises.

39:09.062 --> 39:10.643
- We are on the run.

39:10.643 --> 39:12.249
I rang Dodie earlier this morning

39:12.249 --> 39:14.388
and I was like, "Dodie,
can you please pick us up?"

39:14.388 --> 39:18.189
- Here he is.
(phone ringing)

39:18.189 --> 39:20.689
- How we doing, you all right?

39:22.324 --> 39:23.823
That's all I need to hear.

39:23.823 --> 39:25.209
Yeah all right, cheers.

39:25.209 --> 39:26.456
See ya, bye.

39:26.456 --> 39:30.432
My position with whatever
you guys are doing is

39:30.432 --> 39:34.577
if Dodie says he can trust
you, then I trust you.

39:34.577 --> 39:35.881
It's that simple.

39:35.881 --> 39:37.496
- We're unsure what we're doing next,

39:37.496 --> 39:40.766
we don't know if there's any
places we can camp tonight.

39:40.766 --> 39:42.459
- I'm not gonna promise you anything.

39:42.459 --> 39:43.556
- Nah that's cool.

39:43.556 --> 39:45.348
- But let me just go and
have a word with somebody.

39:45.348 --> 39:46.527
You can trust me.

39:46.527 --> 39:48.657
- [Ismail] Yeah honestly,
I already trust you.

39:48.657 --> 39:49.856
- I'll see you in a bit.

39:49.856 --> 39:50.963
- All right cheers.

39:50.963 --> 39:52.768
Mate, my balls are sweating.

39:52.768 --> 39:53.601
I'm sorry.

39:53.601 --> 39:58.585
Felt like we're being
interrogated, like shitting myself.

39:58.585 --> 40:02.173
- Ben, we've got CCTV on Nate and Ish.

40:02.173 --> 40:03.090
Here we go.

40:04.498 --> 40:06.097
That's definitely Nate.

40:06.097 --> 40:07.521
- [Ben] Get in there.

40:07.521 --> 40:10.473
Any phone records on that pub?

40:10.473 --> 40:12.832
- [Narrator] Examining phone
records when Nate and Ish

40:12.832 --> 40:14.756
were dropped off at the second pub,

40:14.756 --> 40:17.038
the hunters discovered
calls which could indicate

40:17.038 --> 40:19.468
the next leg of their journey.

40:19.468 --> 40:22.441
- One comes back to a little taxi company.

40:22.441 --> 40:24.380
That was a 49 second call.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.611
- All right wicked.

40:25.611 --> 40:27.273
We can do investigations and then find out

40:27.273 --> 40:29.856
exactly where the drop off was.

40:30.713 --> 40:34.014
- Ben, we just got the details
back on that taxi journey.

40:34.014 --> 40:37.002
Being dropped off at Top Bodies Express.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.120
- [Ben] Boom.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.439
That's Huddersfield where
they both studied at uni.

40:40.439 --> 40:41.322
- Yeah.

40:41.322 --> 40:42.209
- Excellent.

40:42.209 --> 40:44.554
We are hours behind, this is good.

40:44.554 --> 40:46.254
This is the best we've had.

40:46.254 --> 40:48.284
- We've identified John
Froud as the director

40:48.284 --> 40:51.984
on Company's House of Top Bodies Express.

40:51.984 --> 40:53.681
- John Froud has got rental properties

40:53.681 --> 40:56.000
all across that area.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.679
So potential there for
like a bed down location

40:58.679 --> 41:01.444
or part of the network
that's gonna come into play.

41:01.444 --> 41:03.172
- Wonder what he can tell us.

41:03.172 --> 41:05.206
- [Ben] Absolutely.

41:05.206 --> 41:07.588
The drop off point to the taxi put it

41:07.588 --> 41:10.833
to a Top Bodies Gym in Huddersfield.

41:10.833 --> 41:11.845
- Awesome.

41:11.845 --> 41:14.030
- [Ben] We're on the
nose with this one now

41:14.030 --> 41:18.113
and we're gonna be all
over it like a nasty rash.

41:21.166 --> 41:24.668
- [Male] We need to get
in, how the fuck we get in?

41:24.668 --> 41:26.497
(knocking)

41:26.497 --> 41:29.390
- Could have John Froud still at the gym.

41:29.390 --> 41:32.662
Perhaps he's shut the shutters
up and they might be inside.

41:32.662 --> 41:35.500
- We are tracking two guys.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.109
Are they in there now?

41:37.109 --> 41:38.397
- [Male] No no no no.

41:38.397 --> 41:39.693
- Could we have a look around?

41:39.693 --> 41:41.157
- Yeah course we can, yeah.

41:41.157 --> 41:42.528
- [Male] Thanks man.

41:42.528 --> 41:44.054
What's in this door, mate?

41:44.054 --> 41:46.721
- [Male] It's just a store room.

41:49.064 --> 41:51.332
- [Female] So you don't
know the two lads, no?

41:51.332 --> 41:52.478
- [Male] No not at all.

41:52.478 --> 41:53.643
- [Female] Never met 'em before?

41:53.643 --> 41:54.765
- [Male] No, no.

41:54.765 --> 41:56.592
- [Male] I was like oh
they've gotta be in there,

41:56.592 --> 41:58.508
they've gotta be in
there, gotta be in there.

41:58.508 --> 41:59.591
Fucking hell.

42:02.811 --> 42:05.350
(fly buzzing)

42:05.350 --> 42:07.056
- Huddersfield.

42:07.056 --> 42:08.145
- Ismail.

42:08.145 --> 42:10.480
How safe do you feel right now my G?

42:10.480 --> 42:11.471
- Quite safe mate.

42:11.471 --> 42:14.070
I'd rather have fleas on me than hunters.

42:14.070 --> 42:14.903
- Exactly.

42:15.969 --> 42:18.865
- [Narrator] Gym owner John
Froud has put the boys up

42:18.865 --> 42:21.785
in one of his rental properties.

42:21.785 --> 42:23.716
- Let's just try and not get caught here.

42:23.716 --> 42:24.904
- I'll be honest mate,

42:24.904 --> 42:26.650
I'm not worried about them coming here.

42:26.650 --> 42:29.567
(knocking at door)

42:35.152 --> 42:36.141
Hiya.

42:36.141 --> 42:37.342
- Hiya, you all right?

42:37.342 --> 42:38.590
- Yeah.

42:38.590 --> 42:41.698
- Right, we've had a small development.

42:41.698 --> 42:43.963
Just got a phone call on my way home,

42:43.963 --> 42:47.286
he said, "Some guys came in to the gym,

42:47.286 --> 42:48.845
"were looking for these guys

42:48.845 --> 42:50.715
"and now they're asking about you."

42:50.715 --> 42:51.572
Meaning me.

42:51.572 --> 42:53.336
So they are onto me.

42:53.336 --> 42:56.279
But as far as I guess,
they're only interested in me

42:56.279 --> 42:58.814
as another person that
may have just briefly

42:58.814 --> 43:02.322
encountered you, and may
not have even been told.

43:02.322 --> 43:05.464
They don't know what John Froud's like.

43:05.464 --> 43:08.832
The only weak link is my location being on

43:08.832 --> 43:11.368
on my phone while I was here today.

43:11.368 --> 43:12.625
- [Ismail] Today, yeah.

43:12.625 --> 43:14.576
- But obviously they don't know that

43:14.576 --> 43:16.324
otherwise they'd be here by now,

43:16.324 --> 43:17.680
you'd already be nicked.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.292
- What do we do now?

43:19.292 --> 43:20.450
- Just breathe.

43:20.450 --> 43:21.283
- Do we...

43:21.283 --> 43:22.989
- Just breathe, it's all right mate.

43:22.989 --> 43:23.993
It's all right.

43:23.993 --> 43:24.910
- I'm trying to.

43:24.910 --> 43:26.876
- Because if you calm
down we can make these...

43:26.876 --> 43:28.134
We can just think straight.

43:28.134 --> 43:29.237
- [John] Right, I'm gonna get off.

43:29.237 --> 43:30.257
- Thanks a lot John.

43:30.257 --> 43:32.182
- No problem, I'll call
in tomorrow at some point.

43:32.182 --> 43:33.402
All right then, take care.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.390
- Thanks again John.

43:34.390 --> 43:35.412
- Cheers for now.

43:35.412 --> 43:36.819
- See you later.

43:36.819 --> 43:40.468
Do we leave Huddersfield
and shoot off somewhere?

43:40.468 --> 43:43.284
- They're gonna be expecting
us to be on foot and camping,

43:43.284 --> 43:44.742
so I think we're safe here.

43:44.742 --> 43:45.898
We stay here, safe as houses

43:45.898 --> 43:48.815
and we just keep our nuts together.

43:52.426 --> 43:53.880
- [Male] All right John.

43:53.880 --> 43:55.450
How you doing buddy?

43:55.450 --> 43:57.024
- [Narrator] Ground hunters have tracked

43:57.024 --> 43:59.194
John Froud to his home address.

43:59.194 --> 44:00.733
- I got a bizarre phone call,

44:00.733 --> 44:03.207
so I was kind of half
expecting you to turn up.

44:03.207 --> 44:04.126
- [Male] Right.

44:04.126 --> 44:08.596
- Saying how a couple of
lads came into his gym.

44:08.596 --> 44:10.519
- [Male] One's called Ish, Ismael,

44:10.519 --> 44:13.745
the other one's call
Nathanael, Nate, about 25.

44:13.745 --> 44:16.362
- [Male] Well put it this
way, have you seen 'em?

44:16.362 --> 44:17.195
- No.

44:18.195 --> 44:19.558
It makes sense.

44:19.558 --> 44:22.131
- [Male] Just that you're
shaking, that's all.

44:22.131 --> 44:24.677
- [Male] We know they got
bounced onto your gym,

44:24.677 --> 44:26.404
so we know they turned up there.

44:26.404 --> 44:28.394
- [Male] So talk to me about that.

44:28.394 --> 44:29.718
(laughing)

44:29.718 --> 44:32.269
'Cause currently you're
looking a bit silly currently.

44:32.269 --> 44:34.617
- No no, you're the blokes
that are now looking silly.

44:34.617 --> 44:36.064
- [Male] Okay, why's that?

44:36.064 --> 44:38.450
- You know why that is,
'cause you know what

44:38.450 --> 44:40.132
you just told me is complete bullshit

44:40.132 --> 44:41.829
and you're stabbing in the dark.

44:41.829 --> 44:42.709
Don't ya?

44:42.709 --> 44:43.705
Come on.

44:43.705 --> 44:45.222
Look at me.

44:45.222 --> 44:46.055
You do.

44:48.249 --> 44:51.166
- Where's your phone at the moment?

44:53.901 --> 44:56.776
I wanna look at your geographic
position on that phone,

44:56.776 --> 44:59.445
'cause that phone tells
us everywhere you've gone.

44:59.445 --> 45:01.747
I find it odd that you've
deleted all your call history.

45:01.747 --> 45:05.159
And that's a man who's
got something to hide.

45:05.159 --> 45:06.992
- [Male] Corby Street.

45:07.835 --> 45:10.324
So what were you doing
in that part of town?

45:10.324 --> 45:11.598
- I was working.

45:11.598 --> 45:13.371
- [Male] Okay, where abouts?

45:13.371 --> 45:14.623
- Corby Street.

45:14.623 --> 45:15.992
- [Male] So who's house was it?

45:15.992 --> 45:16.825
- Mine.

45:16.825 --> 45:17.658
- [Male] Your house?

45:17.658 --> 45:18.491
- Yeah.

45:18.491 --> 45:19.324
- [Male] Rental?

45:19.324 --> 45:20.157
- [John] Yeah.

45:20.157 --> 45:21.175
- [Male] Got any other
rentals in the town?

45:21.175 --> 45:22.008
- [John] Yeah one or two.

45:22.008 --> 45:22.841
- [Male] Got a few.

45:22.841 --> 45:25.127
Do you have any paperwork
that can clarify that?

45:25.127 --> 45:26.360
- I'll go and find it.

45:26.360 --> 45:27.696
- No, here, I know where it is.

45:27.696 --> 45:29.156
- You know where it is?

45:29.156 --> 45:30.614
- Yeah.

45:30.614 --> 45:32.884
- [Male] We know they've
stayed in Corby Street.

45:32.884 --> 45:34.345
You know that I know that.

45:34.345 --> 45:36.258
- I don't know how you would know that

45:36.258 --> 45:37.945
because I don't think they did.

45:37.945 --> 45:38.824
- Okay.

45:38.824 --> 45:41.111
You all right yeah?

45:41.111 --> 45:42.769
Can I see your phone again.

45:42.769 --> 45:44.377
Minutes ago you rang Mike.

45:44.377 --> 45:46.112
Okay talk to me about that.

45:46.112 --> 45:48.516
Why'd you feel the need to
speak to Mike so quickly?

45:48.516 --> 45:50.428
- He's one of my mates,
I wanna speak to him.

45:50.428 --> 45:52.215
- Mike's running round
to one of your houses now

45:52.215 --> 45:53.557
to turf the lads out.

45:53.557 --> 45:54.975
- Hey he might be mightn't he?

45:54.975 --> 45:55.854
- That's it.

45:55.854 --> 45:57.246
- There's no point saying anything else.

45:57.246 --> 45:58.291
- [Male] Let's go.

45:58.291 --> 46:00.245
Get the call in to Ben now.

46:00.245 --> 46:01.314
Ben?

46:01.314 --> 46:02.569
- [Ben] You all right gents?

46:02.569 --> 46:04.868
- [Male] Nathanael and Ismail,
they're at Corby Street now,

46:04.868 --> 46:07.739
we've ripped his story apart,
he's gone into the house,

46:07.739 --> 46:10.098
made two calls to a guy called Mike.

46:10.098 --> 46:10.990
- Yep.

46:10.990 --> 46:12.816
- He's rung him to tell 'em to get out.

46:12.816 --> 46:14.027
- [Ben] Cool, nice one.

46:14.027 --> 46:15.802
- [Peter] Great work fellas.

46:15.802 --> 46:17.219
We're on our way.

46:18.359 --> 46:20.713
- We anticipate that they potentially are

46:20.713 --> 46:22.840
or about to vacate Corby Street.

46:22.840 --> 46:26.687
Okay, we're entering
target premises area now.

46:26.687 --> 46:31.687
(knocking at door)
(tense music)

46:37.776 --> 46:38.609
- Fuck.

46:40.449 --> 46:41.399
- On route.

46:41.399 --> 46:43.801
- We have to get out of here now.

46:43.801 --> 46:44.899
- Boom.

46:44.899 --> 46:46.402
- We need your help.

46:46.402 --> 46:48.665
We've pushed our luck,
we've played with fire.

46:48.665 --> 46:50.059
(knocking at door)

46:50.059 --> 46:51.379
- I'm lost and lonely.

46:51.379 --> 46:54.464
I haven't got anyone that
I can ring to help me.

46:54.464 --> 46:55.939
- ETA four minutes.

46:55.939 --> 46:57.946
- [Matt] Turning and
running isn't an option.

46:57.946 --> 47:00.697
- This capture will be ours to enjoy.

47:00.697 --> 47:03.447
(dramatic music)
