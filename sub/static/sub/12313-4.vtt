WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:03.468
Help! Someone please help my brother.

00:03.619 --> 00:04.721
Hang in there, Ian.

00:04.754 --> 00:06.222
I promise you'll get
your foot back in a sec.

00:06.254 --> 00:07.924
I'd like to speak to your folks anyway.

00:07.955 --> 00:09.057
They're not around, but, uh,

00:09.090 --> 00:10.525
do you have, like, a card or something?

00:10.558 --> 00:14.197
I've actually been in a lot of
pain since the bike accident.

00:14.229 --> 00:15.764
It looks like pancreatitis,

00:15.798 --> 00:17.834
so I'll need to reexamine
you at some point.

00:17.866 --> 00:19.068
And I'd like to talk to your aunt

00:19.101 --> 00:20.236
so that she knows what's going...

00:20.269 --> 00:21.304
Yeah, that's fine.

00:27.509 --> 00:29.378
All right, check with the
ER in Riverhead then.

00:29.411 --> 00:31.747
Just get back to me, ASAP though, okay?

00:31.780 --> 00:34.016
All right, bye.

00:34.050 --> 00:35.952
Really? Two phones?

00:35.984 --> 00:37.085
You know you're running a hospital,

00:37.118 --> 00:38.320
not a stock exchange, right?

00:38.353 --> 00:40.022
One for hospital business development,

00:40.056 --> 00:41.691
one for staffing.

00:41.724 --> 00:43.293
And one for HankMed.

00:43.325 --> 00:44.627
This one usually stays in the bag though

00:44.660 --> 00:45.929
'cause three phones
would look ridiculous.

00:45.962 --> 00:46.996
Plus, you pretty much got the day-to-day

00:47.029 --> 00:48.031
handled over there anyway.

00:48.063 --> 00:49.564
Well, not today.

00:49.597 --> 00:51.400
The bookkeeper dropped
off these spreadsheets.

00:51.434 --> 00:53.436
I need you to decipher them, please.

00:54.569 --> 00:55.771
Looks like we're low on retainers.

00:55.804 --> 00:57.005
Oh, my God.

00:57.039 --> 00:59.375
What, business development emergency?

00:59.407 --> 01:01.109
No. Emergency room emergency.

01:01.143 --> 01:03.513
Most of the physicians have come
down with this awful summer cold

01:03.545 --> 01:04.980
right when the head
of ER is on vacation,

01:05.013 --> 01:06.115
so it's just causing a whole bunch of...

01:06.148 --> 01:07.316
Oh, my God!

01:07.350 --> 01:08.717
Now Dr. Roseman can't make it back

01:08.750 --> 01:10.953
till later today. I gotta go.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.422
I gotta find someone to cover the ER.

01:12.455 --> 01:15.291
I could do it.

01:15.324 --> 01:16.459
You?

01:16.491 --> 01:18.026
Yeah, I could cover the shift.

01:18.059 --> 01:19.695
It took the threat of an
international incident

01:19.729 --> 01:22.664
to make you an attending,
and that was just on paper.

01:22.697 --> 01:25.535
You're House Call Hank,
not Hospital Hank.

01:25.568 --> 01:27.203
For you, I can make an exception.

01:27.235 --> 01:30.439
I'll even give you a family discount.

01:38.247 --> 01:40.984
- Morning, Jeremiah.
- Yes, it is.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.351
Any chance you can help
me with appointments?

01:42.384 --> 01:43.819
It's just you and me today.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.655
Of course, I've been working on
these data tables for hours.

01:46.688 --> 01:49.458
I could use a break.

01:49.491 --> 01:50.559
What?

01:50.592 --> 01:52.661
You just called seeing patients a break.

01:52.694 --> 01:54.062
You've come a long way

01:54.095 --> 01:56.732
since you were isolating
yourself in here.

01:56.765 --> 01:58.434
Why is it just the two of us today?

01:59.869 --> 02:02.138
- What do we got?
- Male, 30s. Syncope.

02:02.170 --> 02:04.473
Full-thickness forehead laceration.

02:07.476 --> 02:10.947
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Clear the way.

02:10.979 --> 02:12.781
Welcome to the ER, Dr. Lawson.

02:12.815 --> 02:14.783
But we usually just let
the EMTs bring them in.

02:14.817 --> 02:16.552
Oh, okay. What's your name?

02:16.585 --> 02:18.254
- Barry.
- Hi, Barry, I'm Hank.

02:18.287 --> 02:19.522
Let's take a look at this.

02:19.555 --> 02:20.857
When is the doctor getting here?

02:20.889 --> 02:22.257
I am the doctor.

02:22.291 --> 02:26.128
Oh, uh, call me Dr. Lawson.

02:26.162 --> 02:27.330
So what happened?

02:27.363 --> 02:28.663
I was chopping vegetables for a salad.

02:28.697 --> 02:31.533
This new diet is more
work than it's worth.

02:31.567 --> 02:33.136
Suddenly I got dizzy.

02:33.168 --> 02:35.337
Next thing I knew, I was
on the floor bleeding.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.239
I must have hit the
counter on the way down.

02:37.273 --> 02:38.941
Huh. Do you have a history
of heart disease?

02:38.973 --> 02:40.910
- Any shortness of breath?
- No.

02:40.942 --> 02:42.511
Okay, you said you're on a new diet.

02:42.544 --> 02:43.678
Do you eat a lot of salad?

02:43.711 --> 02:46.448
I do now. I just went vegetarian.

02:46.482 --> 02:47.750
Dr. Lawson, should I call plastics?

02:47.782 --> 02:48.851
No, I can stitch it myself.

02:48.883 --> 02:50.952
I need a 4.0 Vicryl, 6.0 nylon.

02:50.985 --> 02:52.587
My ER is short on physicians.

02:52.620 --> 02:54.256
You need to delegate.

02:54.289 --> 02:57.793
Uh, all right, call plastics.

02:57.827 --> 02:59.362
But make sure Barry's
hematocrit is over 30.

02:59.394 --> 03:01.029
Let me know immediately if it's not.

03:01.062 --> 03:02.464
Got it.

03:06.602 --> 03:08.471
Hi, Hank.

03:12.475 --> 03:15.578
Jill.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.884 --> 03:27.552
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

03:27.585 --> 03:29.151
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

03:29.303 --> 03:31.011
Well, I was gonna call you,
but then I saw your name

03:31.155 --> 03:32.923
on the ER board, and I just...

03:32.956 --> 03:34.924
I thought it'd be more
fun to surprise you.

03:34.958 --> 03:37.358
Mission accomplished.

03:38.038 --> 03:39.740
Oh, Hank, sorry.

03:39.772 --> 03:41.073
This is Dr. deGroot.

03:41.106 --> 03:43.009
Oh, please, call me Hans.

03:43.043 --> 03:44.243
Hans, nice to meet you.

03:44.277 --> 03:46.046
So what are you doing here?

03:46.079 --> 03:48.048
Well, the foundation had a
fundraiser in the city,

03:48.080 --> 03:49.415
and they flew us in at the last minute.

03:49.449 --> 03:51.350
And, well, ever since

03:51.384 --> 03:53.287
they put a picture of Hans
and me on the homepage,

03:53.319 --> 03:55.822
we've accidentally become
the face of the clinic.

03:55.855 --> 03:57.090
Ah.

03:57.122 --> 03:58.825
And who wouldn't want to
open up their checkbook

03:58.859 --> 04:01.128
after seeing a photo of
this beautiful woman

04:01.160 --> 04:02.795
vaccinating a baby?

04:02.829 --> 04:05.199
Okay, look, I'm pretty sure that

04:05.231 --> 04:06.733
it's the shirtless shot
of you in the rain

04:06.765 --> 04:08.201
that tends to seal the deal.

04:08.235 --> 04:09.870
- Huh.
- I gave my shirt to that boy

04:09.903 --> 04:13.206
as a makeshift sling. It
was medically necessary.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.042
- Okay.
- Huh.

04:15.074 --> 04:17.144
Hey, so, uh, cancel your plans tonight.

04:17.177 --> 04:18.144
I'm trying to get everyone together

04:18.177 --> 04:19.478
for a HankMed family reunion

04:19.511 --> 04:20.747
before we head off on the red-eye.

04:20.779 --> 04:22.382
- I wouldn't miss it.
- Good.

04:22.415 --> 04:24.084
And if it's not too much to ask,

04:24.117 --> 04:25.285
I wondered if you could help me

04:25.317 --> 04:27.286
with some antibiotics for the trip back.

04:27.319 --> 04:29.656
I have a sore throat. Probably strep.

04:29.689 --> 04:31.158
Been getting it a lot.

04:31.190 --> 04:33.193
Okay, let me take a look.

04:37.863 --> 04:41.000
Yeah, you do have a
low-grade temp... 99.9.

04:41.033 --> 04:42.735
- Any other symptoms?
- Just a sore throat.

04:42.769 --> 04:45.072
Okay, I'm just gonna
grab a quick culture.

04:49.242 --> 04:51.177
Open up, please.

04:52.312 --> 04:54.615
Great. Wow.

04:54.648 --> 04:56.550
I never thought I would see Hank Lawson

04:56.583 --> 04:58.252
back in the ER.

04:58.285 --> 04:59.586
What brought you in from the cold?

04:59.619 --> 05:01.655
Ah, it's just for today. Long story.

05:01.687 --> 05:03.156
- I'll tell you tonight.
- Okay.

05:03.189 --> 05:06.126
- Jill? Oh, my gosh!
- Hey!

05:06.158 --> 05:08.228
Aww, my favorite ER taskmaster... hi!

05:08.261 --> 05:11.564
Wow. We need to catch up.

05:11.598 --> 05:14.167
And, Dr. Lawson, we've got an
ingrown toenail with paronychia.

05:14.199 --> 05:15.569
Okay, I'll be right there.

05:15.601 --> 05:17.703
Um, here is a script for penicillin,

05:17.737 --> 05:19.773
and I will let you know the
results of the strep test.

05:19.805 --> 05:21.474
- Thank you.
- Okay.

05:21.507 --> 05:22.808
So good to see you.

05:22.841 --> 05:24.144
So yeah, I'll see you tonight, okay?

05:24.177 --> 05:25.412
All right, great.

05:25.444 --> 05:27.713
- All right, bye.
- Bye. Nice to meet you, Hans.

05:27.747 --> 05:29.083
Bye.

05:31.550 --> 05:34.553
Dr. Lawson?

05:34.586 --> 05:37.423
- Dr. Lawson!
- Yes, right. Coming.

05:41.694 --> 05:43.430
Hello, Miss Green?

05:43.462 --> 05:45.798
I'm Dr. Sacani from HankMed.

05:45.832 --> 05:47.000
Oh, hi.

05:47.033 --> 05:49.269
Sorry, I got buried in my work,

05:49.301 --> 05:51.036
and I forgot you were coming.

05:51.070 --> 05:52.538
That's all right.

05:52.572 --> 05:54.908
I'm familiar with the experience
of being lost in one's work.

05:54.940 --> 05:56.308
What can I do for you?

05:56.341 --> 05:58.144
Uh, I've been feeling...

05:58.278 --> 06:00.747
well, it's my head,

06:00.780 --> 06:03.450
and I... I just feel...

06:03.482 --> 06:05.985
Is your headache sharp or a dull pain?

06:06.018 --> 06:08.554
Uh, dull at the temples.

06:08.588 --> 06:10.256
Just on and off for a few weeks.

06:10.290 --> 06:11.491
What else?

06:11.523 --> 06:15.095
You just feeling sort of, um,
achy, tired, sore, weak?

06:15.127 --> 06:16.962
Weak... that's it.

06:16.996 --> 06:20.000
And my wrist started
hurting this morning.

06:20.033 --> 06:22.535
Okay, um, we'll start with an exam.

06:22.568 --> 06:24.571
I'll get some vitals.

06:36.381 --> 06:38.117
Dr. Sacani?

06:38.150 --> 06:41.353
Uh, those bottles have scrolls in them,

06:41.386 --> 06:43.656
like the Message Tree from
"The Chronicles of Zall."

06:43.689 --> 06:45.891
Are you a C.G. Leviathan fan?

06:45.924 --> 06:47.360
Well, I...

06:47.393 --> 06:49.095
You're obviously
familiar with the books.

06:49.127 --> 06:50.562
Uh, very.

06:50.595 --> 06:51.997
There's a book festival in town.

06:52.030 --> 06:52.999
I was thinking of going.

06:53.032 --> 06:54.034
They're gonna have a, uh,

06:54.066 --> 06:55.401
a panel on whether
Jazwick is really dead.

06:55.434 --> 06:57.836
Sacerdas saw his death in a vision,

06:57.869 --> 07:00.506
but the visions have been
changeable in the past.

07:00.540 --> 07:03.076
I saw that they were doing that panel.

07:03.109 --> 07:05.645
Are you going?

07:05.677 --> 07:08.081
I-I considered it, but, uh...

07:08.114 --> 07:10.450
It's... crowds make me nervous.

07:10.482 --> 07:12.052
Oh, me too.

07:12.085 --> 07:14.120
But I was hoping I could find out

07:14.153 --> 07:16.222
whether Leviathan has finished
writing the new installment.

07:16.254 --> 07:19.191
He is as mysterious as his next book.

07:19.225 --> 07:21.594
Even the Internet doesn't
know who he really is.

07:21.626 --> 07:23.896
Oh, um, your blood
pressure is a bit high,

07:23.929 --> 07:25.531
so we should, uh, keep an eye on that.

07:25.564 --> 07:26.865
In the meantime, I'd like
to examine your wrist,

07:26.898 --> 07:28.268
and I'll draw some blood

07:28.300 --> 07:29.935
to check for thyroid irregularities

07:29.968 --> 07:32.071
or nutritional deficiencies.

07:32.105 --> 07:34.540
Uh, Ms. Green, what is your first name?

07:34.573 --> 07:36.876
Cindy.

07:36.908 --> 07:39.111
Cin...

07:39.145 --> 07:40.747
Wait... oh.

07:40.780 --> 07:44.551
Cindy Green. C.G.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.386
You're C.G. Leviathan?

07:47.987 --> 07:50.422
Hey, Lena from the bike crash, right?

07:50.456 --> 07:51.758
- Yeah.
- How's your brother's foot?

07:51.790 --> 07:53.225
He's great. Back to
bouncing off the walls.

07:53.258 --> 07:55.128
Well, you're not. So what's going on?

07:55.161 --> 07:56.830
I keep throwing up.

07:56.863 --> 07:58.698
Apparently, taco trucks
that are Instagram famous

07:58.731 --> 08:00.399
can still give you food poisoning.

08:00.433 --> 08:01.734
Okay, well, let's make
sure it's not something

08:01.767 --> 08:03.435
worse than bad tacos.

08:03.469 --> 08:06.306
Lie back, please.

08:06.339 --> 08:08.741
Does that hurt?

08:08.774 --> 08:10.210
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

08:10.243 --> 08:12.045
No, I just... I think that
it's just that I'm sore

08:12.077 --> 08:13.445
from all the throwing up.

08:13.479 --> 08:15.981
Right, um, Margaret?

08:16.015 --> 08:18.517
We need a CBC, BMP, UPREG,

08:18.551 --> 08:20.719
and then start her on
Zofran and IV fluids.

08:20.753 --> 08:22.856
- Doctor?
- Hey, um...

08:22.888 --> 08:24.323
you're in good hands with
Nurse Margaret here.

08:24.356 --> 08:25.724
I'll come back soon to check up on you.

08:25.758 --> 08:26.893
Hey, what are you doing here?

08:26.925 --> 08:28.126
Did you get an executive paper cut

08:28.159 --> 08:29.828
from all that business developing?

08:29.861 --> 08:31.463
Uh, no, I'm here 'cause, uh,

08:31.496 --> 08:34.832
your department's backed up.

08:34.866 --> 08:38.035
Connecting with patients makes
you an amazing concierge doctor,

08:38.068 --> 08:39.972
but you can't run the ER like HankMed.

08:40.005 --> 08:42.942
So just... just treat
them and move on, okay?

08:42.975 --> 08:44.744
Wait, did you seriously
just come down here

08:44.776 --> 08:45.911
to tell me to move the meat?

08:45.944 --> 08:47.246
No, I came down here

08:47.279 --> 08:48.648
to tell you to move the patients.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.715
Huh.

08:49.749 --> 08:51.017
Like that guy with the
cut on his forehead.

08:51.049 --> 08:52.385
- Barry?
- Yes, Barry.

08:52.418 --> 08:53.553
You know you spent 22%
more time with him

08:53.586 --> 08:55.188
than our average for lacerations?

08:55.221 --> 08:57.724
22%... what happened during that 22%?

08:57.756 --> 08:59.892
Did you learn all his hopes and dreams?

08:59.925 --> 09:01.927
No, I learned that he's
on a new vegetarian diet,

09:01.961 --> 09:03.263
which caused anemia.

09:03.295 --> 09:04.863
That's why he fainted.
That's what I learned.

09:04.896 --> 09:07.332
- Clear the way! Bed right here!
- Male, late 40s.

09:07.366 --> 09:08.433
He was found unconscious in his office.

09:08.467 --> 09:10.035
He has no pulse and is not responding

09:10.068 --> 09:11.437
to chest compressions.

09:11.470 --> 09:13.206
Okay, thank you. Let's
get him on the bed.

09:13.239 --> 09:16.409
On three... one, two, three.

09:16.442 --> 09:19.578
Okay.

09:19.611 --> 09:20.579
What's this?

09:20.612 --> 09:22.414
Who wears a fanny pack with a suit?

09:22.448 --> 09:23.816
This is not the time.

09:23.848 --> 09:24.950
It's not a fanny pack.

09:24.983 --> 09:25.951
It's a battery.

09:25.985 --> 09:29.422
It's connected to something.

09:29.454 --> 09:31.423
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop.

09:31.457 --> 09:33.492
He has a Left Ventricular
Assist Device in his heart.

09:33.525 --> 09:34.861
Compressions could kill him.

09:34.894 --> 09:38.097
Um, call the cardiothoracic surgeon.

09:38.130 --> 09:39.532
Tell her to prep the OR.

09:39.564 --> 09:42.234
The wire from the battery pack
to his pump has been cut.

09:42.268 --> 09:43.870
The pump was the only
thing perfusing his body.

09:43.903 --> 09:46.072
Yeah, we don't have time to replace it.

09:46.105 --> 09:48.408
Okay, um, get me a scalpel,

09:48.441 --> 09:50.243
electrical tape, a bunch of hemostats,

09:50.275 --> 09:51.910
and some cardboard.

09:51.943 --> 09:54.280
We're gonna reconnect the battery.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.917
Thank you.

09:58.951 --> 10:00.420
His SpO2 is below 80.

10:00.452 --> 10:02.322
Ground it.

10:13.164 --> 10:15.801
Okay, good.

10:34.754 --> 10:36.188
He's pinking up.

10:36.222 --> 10:37.723
Nice work, Dr. Lawson.

10:37.756 --> 10:40.258
I've never seen that before.

10:40.292 --> 10:42.862
You hired the right guy
for the right day.

10:53.424 --> 10:55.026
I just stumbled into my desk.

10:55.059 --> 10:57.630
Isn't an X-ray a bit overkill?

10:57.663 --> 10:59.365
No, it's an appropriate diagnostic tool

10:59.398 --> 11:01.668
given the amount of swelling
and tenderness in your wrist.

11:04.403 --> 11:06.572
I got that.

11:12.878 --> 11:15.413
It is fractured, which is surprising,

11:15.447 --> 11:17.817
given the low-impact
nature of your injury.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.555
Um, I'll splint the wrist for now,

11:19.587 --> 11:22.057
and we can put the cast on
when the swelling subsides.

11:22.367 --> 11:23.669
It broke so easily.

11:23.701 --> 11:26.404
I... I know I don't get out much,

11:26.437 --> 11:27.822
but I'm not frail.

11:27.994 --> 11:29.263
We'll do some bone density tests

11:29.296 --> 11:30.633
to see if there's
something else going on.

11:30.787 --> 11:33.389
And your wrist will heal
soon, so don't worry.

11:33.422 --> 11:34.627
You'll be typing again in no time.

11:34.788 --> 11:35.990
Wait, I won't be able to type?

11:36.022 --> 11:38.091
How much time is "no time"?

11:38.124 --> 11:39.959
Well, as you yourself wrote,

11:39.993 --> 11:41.829
"The Great Sea can be crossed quickly,

11:41.862 --> 11:43.497
but better to cross it safely."

11:46.266 --> 11:48.868
You're worried because
you're on a deadline?

11:48.901 --> 11:52.372
Book six is due to my editor next month.

11:52.406 --> 11:54.608
The fans are waiting.

11:54.641 --> 11:57.678
Yes, we are.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.712
What brought you to my books?

11:59.746 --> 12:02.483
Um, I have trouble picking up on

12:02.516 --> 12:04.584
unarticulated emotions sometimes,

12:04.618 --> 12:06.152
and my therapist
recommended your fiction

12:06.185 --> 12:08.321
as an intermediary step
'cause the characters

12:08.354 --> 12:11.558
often tell you exactly
what they're feeling.

12:11.592 --> 12:15.262
But you read me though, just now.

12:15.295 --> 12:18.031
You knew why I was worried.

12:18.065 --> 12:20.200
I must be making progress.

12:20.233 --> 12:21.868
I don't mean to brag.

12:21.901 --> 12:25.605
I have trouble relating
to people sometimes too.

12:25.638 --> 12:28.007
They can be so loud and fast.

12:28.041 --> 12:31.878
Everyone coming at you, wanting answers.

12:31.911 --> 12:34.348
That's why I love writing.

12:34.381 --> 12:37.919
My characters quiet down
when I tell them to.

12:39.853 --> 12:42.957
- I could type.
- What?

12:42.989 --> 12:44.657
You could dictate, and I could type.

12:44.690 --> 12:45.993
According to Mavis Beacon,

12:46.026 --> 12:49.096
I'm above average in
both speed and accuracy.

12:49.128 --> 12:50.163
You should know,

12:50.196 --> 12:52.332
I am bound by doctor-patient
confidentiality,

12:52.366 --> 12:56.303
not to divulge any secrets
I may learn about Zall.

12:56.335 --> 12:57.971
Is this you being nice

12:58.004 --> 13:00.740
or you wanting to know
what happens in book six?

13:00.773 --> 13:03.476
Um, both.

13:09.215 --> 13:10.683
<i>So what else is new?</i>

13:10.717 --> 13:13.020
I miss caffeine.

13:13.052 --> 13:15.088
Well, on the plus side,

13:15.122 --> 13:17.690
you are the most beautiful
pregnant woman ever.

13:17.723 --> 13:19.926
Can you please
come over every morning

13:19.959 --> 13:21.929
and tell me that when I
can't fit into anything?

13:21.962 --> 13:23.597
Deal.

13:23.629 --> 13:25.732
In a few weeks, I don't know
where you're gonna be coming to.

13:25.766 --> 13:27.568
Still no word from Johns Hopkins?

13:27.600 --> 13:29.535
Nope, nothing yet.

13:29.569 --> 13:30.971
Well, be patient.

13:31.003 --> 13:32.705
You'll end up where
you're supposed to be.

13:32.738 --> 13:35.242
What matters is that
you're taking a leave.

13:35.275 --> 13:36.776
Like you did.

13:36.810 --> 13:40.046
Yeah, remember how terrified I was?

13:40.079 --> 13:42.016
But once I realized it was my dream,

13:42.049 --> 13:45.219
there was no turning back.

13:45.252 --> 13:46.853
Hey...

13:46.887 --> 13:49.356
I am so proud of you.

13:49.388 --> 13:52.125
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
for taking this on, Jill.

13:52.159 --> 13:55.763
The Divya Katdare I
know can handle it all.

13:55.796 --> 13:58.331
- Hey!
- Hey.

13:58.364 --> 14:01.267
Here you go. Extra hot, extra shot.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.304
- You remembered.
- I did.

14:03.337 --> 14:05.506
So how's it going in the ER?

14:05.539 --> 14:08.409
Yeah, word is you pulled
off this miraculous save

14:08.441 --> 14:09.876
with cardboard and duct tape?

14:09.910 --> 14:11.844
Oh, uh, actually, it
was electrical tape.

14:11.877 --> 14:13.012
Oh.

14:13.046 --> 14:14.848
You do know the point of
an ER is that they have

14:14.881 --> 14:16.116
all the equipment that you need

14:16.148 --> 14:17.517
that you don't need to build
some crazy contraption

14:17.550 --> 14:18.885
like you do at HankMed?

14:18.918 --> 14:20.687
I had to rewire an LVAD on the fly.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.489
I mean, they don't exactly have
a tool for that lying around.

14:23.522 --> 14:25.725
Some things don't change.

14:25.758 --> 14:27.695
It is so good to all be together again.

14:27.728 --> 14:28.862
You sure you can't stay awhile?

14:28.894 --> 14:30.965
I really wish I could,

14:30.998 --> 14:32.465
but we've got so much
going on right now.

14:32.498 --> 14:35.034
The foundation wants to send me
to some of their other clinics

14:35.067 --> 14:37.770
to introduce our new health
care training initiative.

14:37.803 --> 14:39.539
Jill is being modest.

14:39.572 --> 14:40.974
She designed the program herself,

14:41.008 --> 14:42.309
and because it's been so successful,

14:42.341 --> 14:44.477
they wanna put it in clinics
all over the world.

14:44.511 --> 14:46.180
Oh, my God. That sounds incredible.

14:46.213 --> 14:47.181
Thank you.

14:48.648 --> 14:52.119
Ugh, I'm all set for the trip back.

14:52.152 --> 14:55.388
First-world medicine is amazing.

14:56.790 --> 14:58.626
Hans, I'm so glad to finally
meet you on this trip.

14:58.658 --> 15:00.426
I've heard so much about you.

15:00.460 --> 15:02.061
You have?

15:02.095 --> 15:04.965
Well, yeah, hello! The monsoon story?

15:04.998 --> 15:07.033
- The monsoon story.
- Oh, right, right, right.

15:07.066 --> 15:09.235
When there was a puddle so
big outside Jill's bungalow

15:09.268 --> 15:10.403
that people were actually fishing in it.

15:10.436 --> 15:14.374
Yeah, no. The other monsoon story.

15:14.407 --> 15:15.942
When the village flooded

15:15.975 --> 15:18.345
and Hans improvised a rope
bridge across the ravine.

15:18.378 --> 15:19.912
He even saved the goat.

15:19.946 --> 15:21.014
Ah.

15:21.047 --> 15:22.515
I just knew the right knots to tie.

15:22.548 --> 15:24.851
At last, my scouting days in Naaldenveld

15:24.884 --> 15:27.120
gave me something besides chigger bites.

15:28.287 --> 15:30.023
And what did the grateful
villagers call you?

15:33.259 --> 15:35.828
Dr. Big One.

15:35.862 --> 15:37.931
- Dr. Big One?
- Mm.

15:37.964 --> 15:40.099
His surname, deGroot,
translates that way.

15:40.133 --> 15:42.335
Oh, how nice for you.

15:42.369 --> 15:45.272
Mine means "son of
Lawrence." -

15:47.106 --> 15:49.475
Hey, isn't that Lena Crawford?

15:49.508 --> 15:51.044
Is her pancreatitis acting up?

15:51.077 --> 15:54.047
Pancreatitis? She didn't mention that.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.782
Excuse us a moment.

15:58.051 --> 16:00.554
- Hey, Lena.
- You okay?

16:00.586 --> 16:02.522
Why didn't you tell me
about your pancreatitis?

16:02.556 --> 16:05.124
Because I'm better now. That
was, like, forever ago.

16:05.157 --> 16:07.027
Well, you may not be completely better.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.897
Your vomiting could be caused
by pancreatic pseudocysts.

16:09.930 --> 16:12.700
I'm fine. I'm sorry, I
really need to get going.

16:12.733 --> 16:14.468
No, you really need to stay here.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.802
If you have pseudocysts,
we have to drain them.

16:15.835 --> 16:19.772
Otherwise they could rupture.

16:19.806 --> 16:22.109
Please, come back with us.

16:32.119 --> 16:33.753
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:33.787 --> 16:38.091
Evan, thank you for sending so
many supplies to the clinic.

16:38.124 --> 16:39.258
Oh, of course.

16:39.292 --> 16:40.460
Yeah, Hamptons Heritage
is always happy to do

16:40.494 --> 16:43.330
what we can for the, uh, people of...

16:43.363 --> 16:45.398
- Sierra Leone.
- Sierra Leone.

16:45.431 --> 16:46.499
That's right, and all nations, really.

16:46.532 --> 16:47.633
That's why I paused just then.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.470
I was gonna list them all.

16:49.503 --> 16:51.003
Uh, have you guys seen Hank yet?

16:51.037 --> 16:53.639
Yeah, uh, in the ER, of all places.

16:53.672 --> 16:54.941
Mm-hmm.

16:54.974 --> 16:56.744
And he helped me out with a
much needed prescription.

16:56.776 --> 16:58.111
Oh, I hope everything's okay.

16:58.145 --> 17:01.248
Yeah, just running a slight fever.

17:01.281 --> 17:04.217
And you were just in Sierra Leone?

17:04.251 --> 17:05.452
Right this way, please.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.887
Ladies and gentlemen, nice and easy.

17:06.919 --> 17:09.355
<i>Code quarantine, ER.
Code 529.</i>

17:09.387 --> 17:11.523
- Hey, what's going on?
- Quarantine.

17:11.558 --> 17:13.594
<i>Down the hall to the right or left.</i>

17:13.627 --> 17:15.428
Keep calm. Look the other way.

17:15.462 --> 17:18.232
All right, this is clear.

17:18.263 --> 17:20.066
Guys, guys, what's happening?

17:20.098 --> 17:22.468
I forgot about first-world bureaucracy.

17:22.502 --> 17:23.869
We're activating quarantine protocol.

17:23.904 --> 17:25.704
If a patient possibly has Ebola...

17:25.738 --> 17:28.007
Ebola? He has strep.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.610
He has a fever and was
just in Sierra Leone.

17:30.644 --> 17:32.513
Okay, okay. Help me out here.

17:32.545 --> 17:33.780
Was Hans in an area
where there have been

17:33.813 --> 17:36.082
reported cases of Ebola?

17:38.452 --> 17:40.053
There have been no recent cases.

17:40.086 --> 17:42.055
Right, and he's showing
no other symptoms.

17:42.088 --> 17:43.257
If a patient presents with a fever

17:43.290 --> 17:44.925
and has just visited an outbreak region,

17:44.957 --> 17:46.259
I have to quarantine, okay,

17:46.292 --> 17:47.994
until we get the results
of a blood test.

17:48.028 --> 17:51.198
Ev, you're overreacting.

17:51.231 --> 17:53.801
I'm following protocol.

17:56.735 --> 17:58.805
Let's go, guys.

18:06.639 --> 18:08.849
- Paper booties.
- Paper booties.

18:09.033 --> 18:10.002
Paper booties.

18:10.034 --> 18:11.169
Damn it.

18:11.203 --> 18:12.838
"Dan's Papers" has it already.

18:12.870 --> 18:15.139
Evan R. Lawson.

18:15.173 --> 18:17.009
No, no, no. This is not a crisis.

18:17.292 --> 18:18.459
Sanitize your hands thoroughly.

18:18.493 --> 18:19.628
There's a chart on the wall.

18:19.660 --> 18:20.563
Yeah, don't need a chart.

18:20.595 --> 18:22.829
No, that's not true. We're
just covering our bases.

18:23.039 --> 18:25.041
That's right. I've notified the DOHMH.

18:25.073 --> 18:26.509
Now we're just waiting for the LRN

18:26.543 --> 18:27.710
to finish EVD testing.

18:27.744 --> 18:29.079
And, uh... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:29.111 --> 18:31.014
"Make sure to let the
sanitizer dry completely

18:31.046 --> 18:32.381
before putting the gloves on."

18:32.415 --> 18:33.917
Yeah, why don't I take
over the checklist?

18:33.949 --> 18:36.953
- No, it's...
- I know protocol.

18:41.824 --> 18:43.092
Thank you.

18:43.126 --> 18:45.028
- Nitrile gloves.
- Nitrile gloves.

18:45.061 --> 18:48.165
Well, no comment. No, sorry, bye.

18:48.197 --> 18:49.632
Evan R. Lawson.

18:49.666 --> 18:51.268
Yes, thank you for calling back.

18:51.301 --> 18:53.069
Uh-huh, yes, this is
definitely a crisis.

18:53.101 --> 18:55.206
We need CDC backup, ASAP.

18:55.238 --> 18:57.206
You know, Jill, I'm the Ebola lead here.

18:57.239 --> 18:59.708
I need to ask if you
traveled to Sierra Leone.

18:59.742 --> 19:01.110
No. Hans went alone.

19:01.143 --> 19:04.380
Okay, disposable gown.

19:05.782 --> 19:07.650
What about your contact with Hans?

19:07.684 --> 19:09.653
I thought you weren't
worried about Ebola.

19:09.686 --> 19:11.955
I'm not, but I'm worried about you.

19:14.524 --> 19:16.158
Hans came straight from Sierra Leone,

19:16.191 --> 19:18.260
and we met up at the fundraiser,

19:18.293 --> 19:20.831
but he left early because
he had a sore throat.

19:20.863 --> 19:23.566
- Face mask.
- Face mask.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.601
Well, I'm still gonna want to

19:24.634 --> 19:26.002
take your temperature
when we're done here.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.269
When will that be?

19:27.303 --> 19:29.639
It takes about 10 minutes
to don, 20 to doff.

19:29.671 --> 19:31.507
<i>man over PA system: Trauma 100.</i>

19:31.541 --> 19:33.443
<i>MVA. Three non-critical.</i>

19:33.475 --> 19:35.377
They're gonna need you.

19:35.411 --> 19:37.714
I can do the blood draw on Hans.

19:37.747 --> 19:39.616
Hank, you can't do everything.

19:39.648 --> 19:40.983
All right? We can handle this.

19:41.017 --> 19:42.986
Okay.

19:45.687 --> 19:48.791
Okay, let's go, Margaret.

19:48.825 --> 19:52.261
- Paper booties.
- Paper booties.

19:54.830 --> 19:57.567
Hey... whoa! You okay?

19:57.599 --> 19:58.868
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good.

19:58.902 --> 20:00.203
I just needed some fresh air.

20:00.235 --> 20:02.204
All right, I need to talk
to you about a patient.

20:02.238 --> 20:06.443
Right. Wait, wait.

20:06.475 --> 20:07.844
Hey, come on.

20:11.713 --> 20:14.117
Ix-nay on the arantine-quay.

20:16.385 --> 20:18.521
What are you talking about?

20:19.722 --> 20:21.424
Oh, you don't know.

20:21.456 --> 20:25.594
Um, so Hans... Jill's Hans,

20:25.627 --> 20:28.097
he's under quarantine
for possible Ebola.

20:28.131 --> 20:29.166
But don't worry.

20:29.199 --> 20:30.500
Even though we came in contact with him,

20:30.532 --> 20:32.535
we're not considered persons
under investigation

20:32.568 --> 20:33.936
unless a positive blood test comes back.

20:33.970 --> 20:35.838
And I acted really quickly,
so I'm fully confident

20:35.872 --> 20:37.174
that you and your baby are totally...

20:37.206 --> 20:38.841
What are his symptoms?

20:38.875 --> 20:41.178
Just a fever so far.

20:41.211 --> 20:42.612
You know, Ebola's only contagious

20:42.645 --> 20:43.980
when someone is symptomatic

20:44.012 --> 20:45.581
and only through close
and direct contact

20:45.615 --> 20:47.284
with infected bodily fluids.

20:47.317 --> 20:48.617
You sound just like Hank.

20:48.651 --> 20:50.120
We both studied medicine.

20:50.153 --> 20:51.221
Oh, really? You did?

20:51.253 --> 20:52.822
Did you both study running a hospital?

20:52.856 --> 20:54.857
Did you?

20:54.891 --> 20:57.427
Let's just say for a second,
okay, hypothetically...

20:57.460 --> 20:59.261
let's just say I let this go,

20:59.295 --> 21:00.263
and it is Ebola.

21:00.296 --> 21:01.832
What happens?

21:01.865 --> 21:04.201
First, Boris fires me, okay?

21:04.233 --> 21:07.002
Then the community goes into a panic,

21:07.036 --> 21:09.773
as Ebola spreads across
the entire country

21:09.806 --> 21:11.607
until we're in a zombie apocalypse.

21:11.641 --> 21:13.977
Hank disagreed with your
zombie apocalypse theory?

21:14.010 --> 21:17.646
Yes.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.049
But I'm right, right? I
had to call a quarantine.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.318
I don't have all the facts.

21:21.350 --> 21:22.953
Totally get that, but I am right.

21:22.985 --> 21:24.186
While you're worrying about being right,

21:24.220 --> 21:25.655
I'm worried about Lena.

21:25.687 --> 21:26.655
Who's Lena?

21:26.689 --> 21:28.058
She's a HankMed patient

21:28.090 --> 21:30.426
with traumatic pancreatitis,
which caused pseudocysts.

21:30.460 --> 21:31.828
She needs a laparoscopic procedure...

21:31.860 --> 21:34.830
Are you coming up to a word
I'll understand anytime soon?

21:34.864 --> 21:38.068
She's 17 years old, and
her parents passed away.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.768
Oh.

21:39.801 --> 21:42.738
Um, well, her guardian will
have to clear the surgery.

21:42.771 --> 21:44.808
Her Aunt Rosanna returned my call

21:44.840 --> 21:46.141
from an out-of-state number.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.177
She was very vague about where she was,

21:48.211 --> 21:49.980
so I'm starting to wonder
if she's reliable.

21:50.012 --> 21:52.414
Lena has two younger brothers.

21:52.447 --> 21:54.516
I stopped by to check in on
them, but they weren't home.

21:54.549 --> 21:57.887
I just... I don't know
who's watching them.

21:59.588 --> 22:01.491
I'll have a social worker
look into it, okay?

22:01.523 --> 22:03.926
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.363
As airbag burns go, this
one's pretty minor.

22:06.395 --> 22:08.529
You can pick up your
Bacitracin prescription

22:08.564 --> 22:09.666
on the way out.

22:09.699 --> 22:10.667
No hurries.

22:10.700 --> 22:11.902
My dad's just gonna lecture me

22:11.934 --> 22:13.435
about being a bad driver anyways.

22:13.469 --> 22:15.105
Hey, you were in an accident.

22:15.137 --> 22:17.139
And it wasn't even my fault.
It was the shoe's fault.

22:17.173 --> 22:18.607
My heel got caught on the floor mat.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.043
Well, maybe stick to flats for a while.

22:20.076 --> 22:22.379
You know what, that may not
be a bad idea after all,

22:22.412 --> 22:23.712
'cause now I can go shopping.

22:23.745 --> 22:25.314
You see? There's always a silver lining.

22:25.347 --> 22:27.116
- Thank you.
- You got it.

22:33.923 --> 22:36.326
Ugh, I'm so sorry about all this.

22:36.358 --> 22:37.827
Nah, don't be.

22:37.859 --> 22:39.663
This is the best sleep
Hans has had in years,

22:39.695 --> 22:41.597
thanks to the air conditioning.

22:41.631 --> 22:43.500
It's very luxurious.

22:43.532 --> 22:45.534
Another silver lining.

22:47.470 --> 22:50.273
You know, Hank, you should
cut Evan some slack.

22:50.306 --> 22:51.741
Even though he's wrong?

22:51.773 --> 22:53.909
Protocols are designed
to cover everything.

22:53.943 --> 22:55.845
Including the hospital's ass.

22:55.877 --> 22:58.013
You remember what it was like
dealing with bureaucracy.

22:58.047 --> 22:59.182
I do.

22:59.214 --> 23:00.817
I guess it was just a little easier

23:00.849 --> 23:02.351
when you were the administrator.

23:02.385 --> 23:05.454
I was never your boss.

23:05.488 --> 23:07.390
And we didn't always see eye to eye.

23:07.423 --> 23:10.961
I think we did pretty well together.

23:10.993 --> 23:13.129
We did.

23:15.597 --> 23:18.467
I'm so surprised to see you here,

23:18.501 --> 23:20.403
even as a favor to your brother.

23:20.435 --> 23:21.570
Yeah, I don't know.

23:21.604 --> 23:23.405
Maybe I wanted to see if
I still had it in me.

23:23.439 --> 23:25.642
The truth is, I forgot
how much fun it is.

23:25.674 --> 23:28.578
Well, mostly. What about you?

23:28.610 --> 23:30.446
This make you miss the Hamptons?

23:30.480 --> 23:32.582
I miss it every day.

23:32.615 --> 23:33.849
Especially the people,

23:33.883 --> 23:38.154
but I love being in Africa.

23:38.186 --> 23:40.022
It's the best decision I've ever made.

23:40.056 --> 23:43.058
I needed to challenge myself,

23:43.091 --> 23:47.129
and now I just... I feel more alive.

23:47.163 --> 23:50.032
It works for you. You look happy.

23:50.066 --> 23:52.169
Mm. You look happy too.

23:55.937 --> 23:56.905
Hans?

24:00.475 --> 24:03.178
Hey. Are you okay?

24:03.212 --> 24:06.016
My fever has spiked.

24:06.049 --> 24:07.917
102 degrees.

24:10.420 --> 24:12.756
I didn't see that twist coming,

24:12.789 --> 24:14.324
but I did know Jazwick wasn't dead.

24:14.356 --> 24:17.426
I can't believe
that I'm trusting you.

24:17.460 --> 24:19.062
I gave you my word.

24:19.095 --> 24:20.864
Okay.

24:20.896 --> 24:25.201
So remember when Gompho
discovered the mystery herbs?

24:25.233 --> 24:26.935
Right. You mean Ocimum discovered them.

24:26.969 --> 24:28.270
The herbalist.

24:28.303 --> 24:31.373
Oh, I... I mixed them up. That's so odd.

24:31.406 --> 24:32.375
Actually, sit down for a minute.

24:32.407 --> 24:34.877
I should recheck your blood pressure.

24:39.182 --> 24:40.416
Something wrong?

24:40.450 --> 24:42.986
I'm putting myself into
the world of my story.

24:43.019 --> 24:45.188
It's not easy with you here.

24:45.221 --> 24:48.924
I-I don't usually bring people
in with me when I write.

24:48.958 --> 24:50.860
Well, I wish I were more
of a creative type,

24:50.893 --> 24:52.562
so I could keep up.

24:52.595 --> 24:54.697
I don't think of it as creating.

24:54.730 --> 24:58.135
I just follow the characters
where they lead me.

24:59.969 --> 25:03.073
I know it sounds strange to
say about a fantasy kingdom,

25:03.106 --> 25:05.674
but it's very real to me.

25:05.708 --> 25:07.710
I developed a virosome.

25:07.742 --> 25:08.877
What's that?

25:08.911 --> 25:09.946
It's a synthetic vector

25:09.979 --> 25:11.548
that combines the carrying capacity

25:11.580 --> 25:14.283
and immune advantages of plasmids

25:14.317 --> 25:16.618
with the specificity and
efficiency of a virus.

25:16.652 --> 25:18.354
And that's what it felt like to me.

25:18.386 --> 25:21.590
I-I followed the data and
saw where it led me...

25:21.624 --> 25:24.861
from the security of my lab,

25:24.894 --> 25:26.429
but I also find good things

25:26.462 --> 25:30.800
when I venture out into other worlds.

25:34.470 --> 25:37.841
Um, uh, so...

25:37.874 --> 25:40.943
when Oon proposes,

25:40.976 --> 25:44.880
- Astaria says yes.
- Right.

25:44.914 --> 25:47.416
Oh, no, but, uh, he's
evil and her brother.

25:47.450 --> 25:52.255
Oh, I... I don't know why I keep...

25:52.288 --> 25:55.125
You all right?

25:55.157 --> 25:56.525
- Oh.
- Oh.

25:56.558 --> 25:58.427
200 over 130. That's too high.

26:00.195 --> 26:01.697
Easy.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.568
<i>911.</i>

26:05.600 --> 26:06.768
This is Dr. Jeremiah Sacani.

26:06.801 --> 26:08.370
I have a patient in hypertensive crisis.

26:08.404 --> 26:10.440
<i>- What's your address?</i>
- 40 Timber Lane.

26:10.472 --> 26:14.042
<i>- We're on our way.</i>
- Thank you.

26:14.076 --> 26:16.379
I'm gonna give you Labetalol
to temporize your BP.

26:18.713 --> 26:20.517
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

26:23.818 --> 26:25.922
That's good.

26:25.954 --> 26:27.823
He said the Tylenol you gave him

26:27.856 --> 26:30.326
helped his fever, but his
eye is really swollen.

26:30.358 --> 26:33.495
Okay, um, put him on speaker.

26:33.529 --> 26:34.763
Hans,

26:34.797 --> 26:36.732
are you feeling nauseous at all?

26:36.766 --> 26:38.401
<i>No.</i>

26:38.433 --> 26:40.802
<i>But we all know that eye swelling</i>

26:40.836 --> 26:42.739
<i>is a late-stage Ebola symptom.</i>

26:42.771 --> 26:45.140
<i>Hey, let's wait for the test results</i>

26:45.174 --> 26:46.675
before you start talking like that.

26:46.709 --> 26:47.943
Yeah, Jill's right.

26:47.976 --> 26:49.645
<i>Why would you have a late-stage symptom</i>

26:49.678 --> 26:51.046
<i>before any of the early ones?</i>

26:51.079 --> 26:53.149
Hey.

26:53.182 --> 26:55.084
Dr. Roseman just showed
up for the evening shift,

26:55.116 --> 26:56.351
which means you're free.

26:56.385 --> 26:57.587
Okay, good, good.

26:57.619 --> 26:59.321
I wanna get a closer look at Hans' eye.

26:59.355 --> 27:00.990
All right, I'll help with the PPE.

27:01.022 --> 27:05.328
I just... I can't figure out
why it would only be one eye.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.129
Wait a second. Wait a second.

27:07.163 --> 27:10.866
Hans, does your eye feel warm?

27:10.899 --> 27:13.602
<i>My whole face feels warm.</i>

27:13.635 --> 27:16.173
<i>Okay, have you ever had
a blowout fracture?</i>

27:17.405 --> 27:18.907
<i>Yes.</i>

27:18.941 --> 27:21.611
<i>Okay, I'm going in.</i>

27:21.644 --> 27:24.347
Whoa, you gotta get in your gear.

27:24.379 --> 27:26.648
He has an infection that's
clearly getting worse.

27:26.682 --> 27:29.885
Okay, we have to start him on
broad-spectrum antibiotics now,

27:29.918 --> 27:31.119
or he could go septic and die

27:31.153 --> 27:33.189
while we wait for the Ebola test.

27:33.222 --> 27:36.058
Henry, you go in there without
gear, you're quarantined too.

27:38.527 --> 27:40.530
Henry.

27:42.517 --> 27:44.687
So your eye swelling is unilateral,

27:44.719 --> 27:46.554
and you haven't had any
nausea or vomiting?

27:46.653 --> 27:49.156
When I was 12, I hit my face on the ice

27:49.190 --> 27:52.126
and broke the floor of my eye socket.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.929
I was saving my little brother
when he fell through.

27:54.961 --> 27:56.530
Of course you were.

27:56.564 --> 27:58.767
And they put in a metal plate?

27:58.799 --> 27:59.767
Yes.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.635
I think your strep throat bacteria

28:01.669 --> 28:03.838
spread to the plate, which
is acting as a nidus

28:03.871 --> 28:06.908
for the bacteria to lodge and multiply.

28:06.940 --> 28:09.344
Bacterial biofilms on the implant.

28:09.376 --> 28:11.613
Exactly.

28:11.645 --> 28:12.946
I hope you're right.

28:12.979 --> 28:16.785
Well, let's prove I am.

28:16.817 --> 28:21.155
Okay, I'm just gonna give
you some numbing drops.

28:22.489 --> 28:24.492
Okay, good.

28:26.093 --> 28:28.063
And here we go.

28:35.902 --> 28:36.871
Yep.

28:36.903 --> 28:39.641
Sure looks like an infection.

28:39.673 --> 28:41.509
Let's check it out.

28:47.648 --> 28:49.885
Okay, I'm just gonna add some dye.

28:53.488 --> 28:56.123
And now we just need...

28:56.157 --> 28:57.358
Ah.

28:57.391 --> 28:59.760
I guess I'll have to send it to the lab.

28:59.794 --> 29:01.563
You're looking for a microscope?

29:01.595 --> 29:04.364
Yeah.

29:04.398 --> 29:07.035
A microscope app.

29:07.067 --> 29:09.871
Never know when I'm
unable to get to a lab.

29:11.138 --> 29:13.507
I am definitely getting one of those.

29:13.540 --> 29:15.543
Okay.

29:21.015 --> 29:23.552
Yep, there it is.

29:25.219 --> 29:26.220
Guys?

29:29.489 --> 29:32.192
<i>There are white cells and
bacteria in the fluid,</i>

29:32.226 --> 29:33.862
<i>which confirms infection.</i>

29:33.894 --> 29:37.364
That's why he has a fever.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.469
- Boys, come on, please.
- Hey.

29:42.502 --> 29:43.604
Give it back.

29:43.638 --> 29:45.540
Hey, guys. How are you?

29:45.573 --> 29:48.942
I'm Evan. I'm the
hospital administrator.

29:48.976 --> 29:51.579
That means boss.

29:51.612 --> 29:53.147
I'm Wes. This is Ian.

29:53.180 --> 29:55.583
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:55.615 --> 29:59.953
That makes you Lena, right?

29:59.987 --> 30:02.290
So there's a guy refilling
the vending machine

30:02.323 --> 30:03.458
at the end of the hall.

30:03.490 --> 30:05.225
If you drop my name,

30:05.258 --> 30:07.628
Evan R. Lawson, he'll
give you a freebie.

30:10.998 --> 30:13.934
Then you and I could talk.

30:13.968 --> 30:15.737
Go ahead, guys.

30:15.769 --> 30:17.238
- Yes!
- Evan R. Lawson.

30:17.270 --> 30:19.273
Don't forget the R!

30:24.377 --> 30:25.946
So your doctor tells
me you're checking out

30:25.979 --> 30:27.915
against medical advice?

30:27.949 --> 30:29.984
Yeah, because this stupid hospital,

30:30.017 --> 30:31.451
which I guess means you,

30:31.485 --> 30:33.921
decided to send a social
worker to my house.

30:33.954 --> 30:35.556
Right.

30:35.590 --> 30:37.792
We were just worried
about your brothers.

30:37.825 --> 30:39.693
They were at the neighbors',
but now there's gonna be

30:39.727 --> 30:41.528
a child services
investigation and a hearing,

30:41.562 --> 30:43.431
so thank you very much for
messing up our lives.

30:43.463 --> 30:47.200
So your aunt is away?

30:49.769 --> 30:51.038
When's she coming home?

30:51.072 --> 30:53.308
Tomorrow.

30:57.044 --> 30:58.179
I don't believe you.

30:58.211 --> 30:59.180
Now I'm a liar.

30:59.212 --> 31:01.016
No, you're a survivor.

31:02.315 --> 31:04.919
I know 'cause I used to be one too.

31:04.951 --> 31:07.756
Yeah, well, I don't believe you.

31:09.623 --> 31:12.392
I lost my mom when I was, uh,

31:12.425 --> 31:13.860
I guess a little younger than you.

31:13.893 --> 31:16.296
This is after my dad bailed,

31:16.329 --> 31:18.298
so then it was just me and my brother.

31:18.332 --> 31:19.968
We bounced around,

31:20.000 --> 31:24.972
but mostly we just had each other.

31:25.006 --> 31:26.940
Does that sound familiar?

31:28.508 --> 31:30.612
Just because you had to take
care of your little brother

31:30.644 --> 31:31.645
doesn't mean you know anything...

31:31.679 --> 31:35.783
No. He had to take care of me.

31:35.815 --> 31:37.986
I was the little brother.

31:38.018 --> 31:40.954
So I know how much your
brothers need you.

31:40.988 --> 31:42.523
You can't really be there for them

31:42.556 --> 31:44.325
if you don't get well.

31:44.357 --> 31:47.361
So...

31:47.394 --> 31:49.730
can they stay at the neighbors'
for a couple more days?

31:52.199 --> 31:56.004
Can you call off the investigation?

31:56.036 --> 31:59.440
No, but I can be on your side.

32:25.132 --> 32:27.200
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:27.234 --> 32:29.404
Your blood pressure is stabilized.

32:29.437 --> 32:33.608
Um, but your lab results show
high sugar and low potassium.

32:33.641 --> 32:35.109
So I ran your cortisol levels,

32:35.142 --> 32:37.679
and they confirm Cushing's disease.

32:37.711 --> 32:39.079
What is that?

32:39.113 --> 32:41.215
Uh, an adenoma on your pituitary gland

32:41.248 --> 32:43.316
is causing it to release too much ACTH,

32:43.350 --> 32:45.253
which stimulates cortisol production.

32:45.286 --> 32:47.255
Your headaches, weakness,

32:47.287 --> 32:49.323
bone loss, confusion,
high blood pressure

32:49.355 --> 32:50.892
were all caused by too much cortisol.

32:50.924 --> 32:52.759
Will I be okay?

32:52.793 --> 32:55.263
After a transsphenoidal
adenomectomy, yes.

32:55.296 --> 32:57.297
I love those words,

32:57.331 --> 33:00.568
but the only one I understood was "yes."

33:00.601 --> 33:04.104
Um, surgeons will remove the adenoma,

33:04.138 --> 33:06.340
through your nose, actually,
which is minimally invasive.

33:06.373 --> 33:09.876
You'll be back to work in a couple days.

33:09.910 --> 33:11.079
And until your wrist heals,

33:11.112 --> 33:13.081
you can count on me
as your stenographer.

33:13.113 --> 33:15.950
Oh, thank you.

33:15.982 --> 33:18.351
My editor thanks you too.

33:18.384 --> 33:22.155
Speaking of Zall, I had a thought.

33:22.189 --> 33:23.524
If I could get you out of the hospital

33:23.556 --> 33:25.727
for a few hours before the surgery,

33:25.759 --> 33:28.563
would you accompany me on a quest?

33:32.665 --> 33:35.235
Yes, I assure you the
crisis is under control.

33:35.268 --> 33:36.403
Hold on for one second.

33:36.437 --> 33:38.039
I told you there's no news story here,

33:38.072 --> 33:39.239
'cause there was never a crisis.

33:39.273 --> 33:41.309
It...

33:41.342 --> 33:42.477
I'll call you back.

33:42.509 --> 33:44.612
Don't worry, I'm not contagious.

33:44.644 --> 33:47.448
Hans' Ebola test came back negative.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.850
And his CT proved that
he had strep bacteria

33:49.883 --> 33:51.652
on the metal plate in his face.

33:51.684 --> 33:53.653
He'll be okay.

33:53.687 --> 33:54.889
Thanks.

33:54.921 --> 33:56.623
You're very welcome.

33:56.657 --> 33:59.961
For the record though, I knew it.

33:59.994 --> 34:02.662
I knew you would never be
able to take directions

34:02.695 --> 34:04.097
from your little brother.

34:04.130 --> 34:05.866
If Jill had told you to
quarantine a patient,

34:05.900 --> 34:07.067
you would've done it.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.668
You wouldn't have challenged her
in front of the whole hospital.

34:08.702 --> 34:09.969
It wasn't the whole hospital.

34:10.003 --> 34:11.438
Besides, I was right about Hans.

34:11.472 --> 34:13.040
Yeah, but you didn't
know you were right.

34:13.072 --> 34:15.342
I mean, what if it had been Ebola

34:15.376 --> 34:16.543
and not just face strep?

34:16.577 --> 34:17.911
Have you even thought about that?

34:17.945 --> 34:19.478
Regardless, at least at HankMed,

34:19.512 --> 34:21.181
you dismissed me in private, Henry.

34:21.215 --> 34:22.815
Maybe I dismissed some of
your crazy ideas, but I...

34:22.849 --> 34:24.583
Crazy ideas? Oh, my God. Crazy ideas?

34:24.617 --> 34:26.353
Crazy ideas that built
a successful business,

34:26.387 --> 34:27.588
is that what you were gonna say?

34:27.621 --> 34:29.456
Not that you even noticed,
actually, because apparently

34:29.489 --> 34:30.757
you thought I was just a bookkeeper,

34:30.791 --> 34:32.159
since that's all you replaced me with.

34:32.190 --> 34:33.860
Just so you understand,

34:33.893 --> 34:36.563
I was the CEO, CFO, community
outreach director,

34:36.597 --> 34:38.599
media director, and head of sales.

34:38.632 --> 34:39.733
That's five things.

34:39.766 --> 34:41.234
You replaced me with one thing.

34:41.266 --> 34:43.402
Well, I'm one thing. I'm a doctor.

34:43.436 --> 34:44.771
So you probably should've talked to me

34:44.804 --> 34:46.572
before you ordered a medically
unnecessary quarantine

34:46.606 --> 34:48.342
in the middle of the ER
that I was trying to run,

34:48.373 --> 34:49.376
just to help you out.

34:49.409 --> 34:50.545
What are you doing?

34:50.577 --> 34:51.679
We're in the middle of a conversation.

34:51.710 --> 34:52.679
And I'm in the middle
of an important job.

34:52.713 --> 34:54.014
Evan R. Lawson.

34:54.047 --> 34:55.149
Yeah, no, I got plenty of time to talk.

34:55.181 --> 34:57.985
What's up? Wait a minute, what?

34:58.017 --> 35:00.287
Oh, my God.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.023
Well, I thought the muffin selection

35:02.056 --> 35:03.523
in the cafeteria was pretty good.

35:03.557 --> 35:04.692
I don't know who authorized that.

35:04.724 --> 35:05.959
- Okay.
- Well, Cloris...

35:05.992 --> 35:07.094
No, no, no, Cloris, absolutely.

35:07.126 --> 35:08.528
Muffins are by far the
most important thing

35:08.561 --> 35:09.697
I have going on right now, so...

35:09.729 --> 35:11.164
- Okay, give it.
- No, I'm not gonna...

35:11.197 --> 35:12.333
- Give it.
- Stop it.

35:12.365 --> 35:13.700
Then hang up, so we can talk.

35:13.733 --> 35:15.670
- No.
- Give it to me!

35:15.702 --> 35:16.704
- Give me your phone!
- Oh, my...

35:16.737 --> 35:17.872
Henry, are you really doing this?

35:17.905 --> 35:19.607
- I'm really doing this!
- Hold on, Cloris!

35:19.639 --> 35:20.607
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I have your leg.

35:20.641 --> 35:22.677
Give it, give it, give it!

35:22.709 --> 35:23.677
It's mine!

35:27.280 --> 35:31.052
Are you happy now? Are you happy now?

35:31.084 --> 35:34.021
Ev. Ev!

35:42.300 --> 35:44.303
Hmm, yeah, it hurts.

35:47.005 --> 35:49.720
Yep, you definitely
scratched your cornea.

35:50.011 --> 35:52.046
You mean you scratched my cornea.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.836
So I'll give you some drops,

35:54.869 --> 35:56.304
and you'll have to wear an
eye patch for a few days.

35:56.526 --> 35:58.294
Like a pirate?

35:58.327 --> 35:59.996
My staff's gonna have a field day.

36:00.030 --> 36:01.631
You know, technically you're not
adhering to the call panel.

36:01.664 --> 36:03.533
I mean, you should really be
waiting for ophthalmology.

36:03.566 --> 36:05.168
Oh, so now you wanna start
following protocol?

36:05.202 --> 36:06.704
Well, I don't want to
upset the administrator.

36:06.736 --> 36:08.204
Oh, my... you know what? This whole...

36:08.238 --> 36:09.406
All right, look, look, look.

36:09.439 --> 36:11.508
You were right.

36:11.541 --> 36:13.443
I shouldn't have
questioned your authority.

36:13.477 --> 36:16.880
But for the record...

36:16.912 --> 36:18.849
I didn't replace you with a bookkeeper.

36:18.881 --> 36:20.550
I hired one because I
didn't want anyone else

36:20.584 --> 36:22.352
to be HankMed's CFO,

36:22.385 --> 36:24.454
and I kinda hoped that
once you'd settled

36:24.488 --> 36:27.791
into your job here, you'd
have more time for HankMed.

36:27.823 --> 36:29.992
Right. So you could keep
belittling me, right?

36:30.026 --> 36:32.796
No.

36:32.829 --> 36:34.564
Because I miss you.

36:36.365 --> 36:38.369
Huh?

36:38.401 --> 36:40.503
I miss you.

36:40.537 --> 36:43.941
It's strange not having
you there every day.

36:43.974 --> 36:47.010
And I know sometimes we argue,

36:47.043 --> 36:50.780
like today, but...

36:50.814 --> 36:53.417
I don't know, that's us,

36:53.450 --> 36:55.386
and I just...

36:55.419 --> 36:59.323
miss us.

36:59.356 --> 37:02.258
I miss us too.

37:04.561 --> 37:07.530
All right, it's eye patch time.

37:07.564 --> 37:09.133
This is great.

37:09.166 --> 37:10.667
It's gonna be a good look for you.

37:10.700 --> 37:13.738
Just hold that in place.

37:18.307 --> 37:21.144
- Huh.
- What? What?

37:21.177 --> 37:23.012
Just, um, open wide.

37:23.046 --> 37:24.548
My... my mouth?

37:24.581 --> 37:26.849
Your mouth. Open wide and say,

37:26.883 --> 37:28.651
"Ahh..." - Ahh...

37:28.684 --> 37:31.020
"Arrr, matey!"

37:33.122 --> 37:34.758
I hate you.

37:34.791 --> 37:38.028
Yeah, I hate you too.

37:49.305 --> 37:51.274
Your roots are showing.

37:51.307 --> 37:54.811
Tree puns. Clever.

37:54.845 --> 37:58.115
It doesn't look that busy.

37:58.148 --> 38:00.651
Well, the website did say
that the panel would be

38:00.684 --> 38:02.218
at the back of the...

38:04.887 --> 38:06.489
Wow.

38:06.523 --> 38:09.992
They're all here for my books?

38:10.026 --> 38:11.028
- Whoa.
- Hey.

38:11.061 --> 38:12.562
That's too many people.

38:12.595 --> 38:14.597
Ugh, maybe we should go.

38:14.631 --> 38:18.569
I... I... I can read
about the panel online.

38:18.602 --> 38:21.605
Astaria, we are on a quest.

38:28.778 --> 38:31.314
Don't worry, we'll blend right in.

38:31.347 --> 38:33.583
Just have to act like a couple of nerds.

38:33.617 --> 38:35.753
I think we can do that.

38:38.255 --> 38:39.923
Hey, thank you for your help with Lena.

38:39.956 --> 38:41.291
Yeah.

38:41.323 --> 38:43.226
Hopefully the social
services investigation

38:43.260 --> 38:44.628
will light a fire under her aunt,

38:44.660 --> 38:46.630
but, uh, Lena's not too happy about it.

38:46.662 --> 38:47.997
You did what you had to do.

38:48.030 --> 38:50.233
Thanks.

38:50.267 --> 38:52.503
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:52.535 --> 38:54.537
Aw, I really wish we didn't have to

38:54.570 --> 38:55.938
catch this flight tonight.

38:55.972 --> 38:58.374
It wasn't much of a reunion
with the quarantine and all.

38:58.407 --> 39:00.243
Yeah, sorry about that,

39:00.276 --> 39:02.778
even though I'd order it all over again.

39:02.811 --> 39:04.547
- Oh, God, really?
- No doubt.

39:04.581 --> 39:06.716
Totally understand, Evan.

39:06.749 --> 39:07.751
Yeah, nice to meet you.

39:07.783 --> 39:10.320
And, Hank, thank you for everything.

39:10.352 --> 39:13.590
Of course. It was great
to meet you, Hans.

39:13.622 --> 39:16.459
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

39:16.492 --> 39:19.762
Evan, I think you are doing a
great job with my old job.

39:19.796 --> 39:21.031
- Really?
- Yes.

39:21.064 --> 39:23.100
Thank you so much, Jill.

39:23.133 --> 39:25.468
Big shoes to fill.

39:27.671 --> 39:29.973
Divya, I want pictures of the new baby

39:30.006 --> 39:32.643
- and more pictures of Sashi and...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

39:32.675 --> 39:35.511
Well, the whole family,
just keep 'em coming, okay?

39:35.544 --> 39:37.880
- Promise?
- Promise.

39:37.914 --> 39:40.684
Oh, you're gonna be a fantastic doctor.

39:40.716 --> 39:43.019
Come back soon, please.

39:43.052 --> 39:45.788
Yeah.

39:51.827 --> 39:52.829
Ah.

39:57.767 --> 40:00.504
- It was so good to see you.
- You too.

40:00.537 --> 40:02.139
I feel like we barely
had a chance to talk.

40:02.171 --> 40:04.207
I know.

40:06.309 --> 40:09.178
- Maybe...
- Jill!

40:14.283 --> 40:18.088
- Good-bye, Jill.
- Good-bye, Hank.

40:41.144 --> 40:44.747
Well, she found a great guy.

40:44.780 --> 40:46.582
Huh?

40:46.615 --> 40:49.518
Hans.

40:50.552 --> 40:52.521
Oh, God, you thought that...

40:52.555 --> 40:54.725
What? What?

40:54.758 --> 40:57.127
Oh, Hank, Hans is gay.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.463
- He is?
- Yeah.

40:59.495 --> 41:01.097
- So they're not...
- No.

41:01.131 --> 41:02.532
We really need to get Hank on Facebook.

41:02.564 --> 41:04.867
Or what, are you gonna
make him walk the plank?

41:04.901 --> 41:05.902
Yeah.
