10:09.443 --> 10:10.609

10:16.416 --> 10:17.415
called the Body Lockers.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.717
Very funny, Todd.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.418
No, that's-that's true. I was.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.888
Shut the front door. What?
Yeah.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.224
We were good, too. Yeah.
We-we had some paid gigs.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.260
We did a show for State
Senator Tom Scofield.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.762
Scofield. No crap.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.064
You know, we got to focus here.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.266
Yeah.
Okay.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.902
Do a couple moves.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.437
(chuckles)

10:39.439 --> 10:40.572
Cool, all right.
I have...

10:40.574 --> 10:41.606
Let's see, I'm
a little rusty,

10:41.608 --> 10:43.608
but I think I can
do a little...

10:43.610 --> 10:45.276
You got it...
What?

10:45.278 --> 10:46.511
Give me...
give me your flashlight.
What? Yeah.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.646
Here, give me your light,
give me your light.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.647
Club atmosphere.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.648
I'm just trying to...

10:49.650 --> 10:50.782
Club atmosphere.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.083
...incorporate it into it,
but, I guess...

10:52.085 --> 10:53.151
Oh!

10:53.153 --> 10:54.919
Rolling at the club.
I think...

10:54.921 --> 10:55.920
Rolling at the club.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.188
Bottle full of bub.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.256
(laughs):
Nice!

10:58.258 --> 10:59.624
Thanks, man.
Hey!

10:59.626 --> 11:01.259
(laughs)
Very good. Okay.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.594
Let's focus up.
Focus up.
Yeah.

11:02.596 --> 11:05.497
Okay, let's open up
James McMaster.

11:07.967 --> 11:09.801
(sighs):
Whew.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.637
James McMaster is more of
a skeleton than a cadaver.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.105
Cadaver? I hardly knew her.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.473
Boom.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.610
(chuckles) Not really
the appropriate time for that.

11:18.612 --> 11:19.844
Okay.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.615
Okay, let's see
what is under

11:23.617 --> 11:26.117
door number...

11:26.119 --> 11:27.485
Nope.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.522
Okay, God, that looks more like
my nana's junk drawer.

11:30.524 --> 11:34.125
No offense... Tawny Daniels.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.462
These poor bodies
just did not keep.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.865
And Gail needs something she can
really practice on, you know?

11:40.867 --> 11:43.501
I think she needs a pancake
that's a little fresher

11:43.503 --> 11:45.503
off the griddle,
if you know what I'm saying.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.738
Tandy, you better not
be thinking

11:46.740 --> 11:48.206
what I think you're thinking.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.242
Sorry, Gordon.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.817
(sighs)

12:02.188 --> 12:03.388
Ugh!

12:03.390 --> 12:05.724
Think I need some of that
Clarice Starling

12:05.726 --> 12:07.659
under-the-nose cream.

12:07.661 --> 12:09.160
(grunts)

12:09.162 --> 12:11.496
Oh! Oh! I think I hit something.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.998
Oh, yeah, that feels like skull.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.533
Oh, yeah, and
there's some neck

12:15.535 --> 12:16.768
and ribs.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.503
Don't worry, Gordon,
I'm not gonna come

12:18.505 --> 12:19.838
anywhere near those balls.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.005
Hey, Todd, come on.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.007
I need your help, man.
Get in here.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.576
You know, Tandy,
I don't think I can, man.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.511
This isn't like the morgue.
I mean, I knew this guy.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.113
This is Gordon, man.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.381
I know this is hard,
but Gordon's dead,

12:30.383 --> 12:32.717
and there's nothing we can do
to bring him back to life.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.085
Okay.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.755
Yeah, get down here.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.757
(sobbing softly)

12:38.759 --> 12:40.692
Sorry, Tandy, I can't, man.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.060
Suck it up, Todd!

12:42.062 --> 12:43.194
I can't, man!

12:43.196 --> 12:45.196
(crying):
I'm spinning out!

12:45.198 --> 12:47.432
There's just all this stuff,
you know?

12:47.434 --> 12:50.869
Break up with Melissa,
Phil's getting sick,

12:50.871 --> 12:53.605
I'm having sex with Gail,
and now I'm digging up Gordon.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.873
I can't, man.
I just can't.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.207
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.542
You're having
sex with Gail?

12:57.544 --> 12:59.077
(sniffles)
Yes.

12:59.079 --> 13:02.947
Three times. We did it once, and
then we did it two more times.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.883
Does Melissa know?
Are you kidding me?!

13:04.885 --> 13:06.885
No!

13:06.887 --> 13:08.753
I went straight from
breaking up with Melissa

13:08.755 --> 13:10.221
to laying with Gail.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.924
And now I'm digging up
her ex.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.493
Sorry, Gordo, man!

13:15.495 --> 13:17.295
I'm out of control, brother!

13:17.297 --> 13:19.764
You're having sex
with Gail and Melissa?

13:19.766 --> 13:21.566
You dirty dog.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.067
Hey, up top, man.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.736
You're missing
the point, Tandy!

13:24.738 --> 13:27.438
This is the straw
that broke the camel's back!

13:27.440 --> 13:29.908
The camel is dead, and I ate it!

13:29.910 --> 13:31.309
Just like the bacon!

13:31.311 --> 13:32.811
Todd! Todd!
Which is
another thing I did!

13:32.813 --> 13:34.813
Todd! Get ahold
of yourself, man!
(sobbing)

13:34.815 --> 13:36.748
Hey, hey! Okay?

13:36.750 --> 13:37.816
Are you finished?
Yeah.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.584
'Cause there's a man
up in that house

13:39.586 --> 13:40.919
that needs our
help right now.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.453
And if we don't focus,

13:42.455 --> 13:44.956
we're gonna be digging another
hole right next to this one.

13:44.958 --> 13:45.957
Okay?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.792
So shut your
frickin' turd hole

13:47.794 --> 13:49.594
and grab your
dead buddy's legs.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.496
Come on!
Okay.

13:53.966 --> 13:57.468
(both grunting)

13:57.470 --> 13:59.037
(coughs)

13:59.039 --> 14:00.839
Oh, this
frickin' reeks!

14:00.841 --> 14:02.841
(grunting continues)

14:02.843 --> 14:05.009
Take a shower, dude.

14:16.655 --> 14:18.656
Gail.

14:18.658 --> 14:22.794
Todd and I have something
that Todd wants to tell you.

14:22.796 --> 14:24.696
I do?
Yeah.

14:26.298 --> 14:30.235
Uh, there was kind of
a hiccup at the morgue,

14:30.237 --> 14:32.537
so we had to improvise.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.538
Uh...

14:33.540 --> 14:35.473
the results of which

14:35.475 --> 14:39.310
might be slightly upsetting,
but...

14:39.312 --> 14:40.545
What is that?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.881
Oh.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.350
Melissa and Carol
found this for me.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.318
It's for surgery students.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.154
It's got, like,
guts and skin

14:50.156 --> 14:53.057
and appendix--
every-everything I need.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.326
So you won't be needing
a cadaver?

14:55.328 --> 14:56.895
Hardly knew her. Boom.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.196
Why, did you find one?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.164
No, we did...
uh, no, we did not.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.566
Uh, not anywhere.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.002
Wait, what did you
guys want to tell me?

15:04.004 --> 15:06.337
Uh, just that, you know,
Todd, uh, was once

15:06.339 --> 15:09.574
in a hip-hop dance group
called The Body Lockers.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.184
(whispers):
Yeah.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.452
Why would
that upset me?

15:21.454 --> 15:22.587
I think that's
beautiful.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.455
Oh.
When I look
at it this time,

15:24.457 --> 15:25.690
it doesn't upset me.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.191
It's like, I don't know
what I was thinking.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.960
'Cause it's great.
Thanks, Tandy.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.271
(both grunting)

15:48.247 --> 15:49.914
ERICA:
Hey.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.215
Don't worry, okay?

15:51.217 --> 15:54.152
It's gonna work.
Gail's been practicing.

15:57.222 --> 16:00.959
I'm sorry for how things
went down between us.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.560
Don't apologize.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.895
You didn't do anything wrong.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.597
You were just saying
how you felt.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.133
Besides, we can talk about
all this when you're better.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.070
When I'm better.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.738
Hey, buddy.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.239
I found a medicine
you can't buy.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.642
It's called laughter.
Oh!

16:17.644 --> 16:21.245
JK.
(chuckles)

16:21.247 --> 16:23.147
How's it looking, huh?

16:23.149 --> 16:26.117
He's in
a lot of pain, Tandy.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.119
(sighs)

16:28.121 --> 16:30.421
(mutters): Can you come here?
I want to ask you something.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.124
Sorry, I can't hear you.
Permission to buzz the tower?

16:33.126 --> 16:35.593
(mutters):
Can you get me some water?

16:35.595 --> 16:39.163
You want me to be the father

16:39.165 --> 16:41.632
of your unborn child?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.434
(quick exhale)

16:43.436 --> 16:46.304
(laughs)

16:46.306 --> 16:48.773
Can you get me some water?

16:48.775 --> 16:51.342
Oh, water. Yes.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.812
That's what
I thought you said.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.714
I will get the water.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.616
Yeah. Yeah.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.452
(chuckles)
Wa...

17:01.454 --> 17:04.622
Water coming up.
Happy to...

17:04.624 --> 17:06.624
(chuckles)

17:06.626 --> 17:08.526
Friggin' bag.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.963
(chuckles)
Laughter.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.331
MIKE:
<i>Oh, come on, you don't think</i>
<i>I've thought of this,</i>

17:13.333 --> 17:14.465
<i>like, a million times?</i>

17:14.467 --> 17:16.634
No, I-I'm...

17:16.636 --> 17:19.237
No, I'm telling you
it's impossible, okay?

17:19.239 --> 17:20.838
Yes, it is.

17:20.840 --> 17:24.142
Come on, there's no mission
control, there's no nothing.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.144
There's no way we can do it.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.713
It's impossible.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.481
You don't know

17:30.483 --> 17:32.717
what you're talking about.

17:32.719 --> 17:36.654
I know time is running out.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.723
But I'm scared.

17:50.669 --> 17:53.337
(loud groaning)

17:53.339 --> 17:56.074
Oh, that don't look right.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.709
Okay, back to the drawing board.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.679
Gail, we got to do this.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.282
Okay, I-I just need
one more dry run.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.850
Just-just one sec.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.518
No, it's got to be now, Gail.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.120
Okay, I'm... You know what,
I'm gonna take

18:09.122 --> 18:12.023
a quick smoke break and then
we're gonna go right to it.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.724
(groans)
Gail.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.059
Oh,

18:15.061 --> 18:17.195
Phil. Oh, my God.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.298
Oh, my God, Phil!

18:20.300 --> 18:22.433
Oh, farts.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.808
(beeps)

18:31.643 --> 18:34.212
You ready, Phil?

18:34.214 --> 18:35.746
I'll take that as a yes.

18:35.748 --> 18:39.050
What do you say we take this
baby out on the open road, huh,

18:39.052 --> 18:41.452
and, uh, we'll see
what she can do.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.323
Okay...

18:45.325 --> 18:46.757
here goes nothing.

18:46.759 --> 18:47.959
(engine whirrs)

18:47.961 --> 18:49.794
COMPUTER VOICE:
Separation sequence initiated.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.730
(monitor beeps steadily)
Okay, Todd, we're doing this.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.932
Phil, do you
have enough pills

18:54.934 --> 18:57.602
in you, honey?
Are you feeling any pain?

18:57.604 --> 19:01.239
I want you to know I'm gonna
do the very best I can, okay?

19:01.241 --> 19:03.474
Although I am not a doctor...

19:03.476 --> 19:04.742
I probably shouldn't say that.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.310
It's okay.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.188
Okay.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.791
Here we go.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.860
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:24.429 --> 19:26.697
Oh, I can't.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.166
I...
Gail.

19:31.436 --> 19:34.505
Just like we practiced, okay?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.507
Okay.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.612
(computer beeping,
engine humming)

19:41.614 --> 19:42.947
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:42.949 --> 19:45.516
Okay, hand me
the clampy thing.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.051
Okay.
No, no,
the, the, bigger one.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.352
Okay.
Yeah.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.656
Okay.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.859
(alarm beeping,
engine rumbling)

19:54.861 --> 19:56.294
I found it.
Found it? Yeah?

19:56.296 --> 19:58.529
I think I feel it. Okay.
Oh, good. Okay.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.630
Hard to see.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.365
We just got to
cut it out.
Yeah.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.334
(alarms wailing,
engine rumbling)

20:03.336 --> 20:05.536
Does that look right?
It looks great. You got it.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.339
No, no, no, something's wrong,

20:08.341 --> 20:09.974
it's filling up
