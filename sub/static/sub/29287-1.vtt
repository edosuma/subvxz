01:57.428 --> 01:59.362
Like, it's coming!

01:59.364 --> 02:01.430
Come on, gang. Down here.

02:01.432 --> 02:02.765
Are you sure, Fred?

02:02.767 --> 02:04.734
It doesn't look
very safe down there.

02:06.138 --> 02:08.404
It's gotta be better
than what's out there.

02:08.406 --> 02:10.874
Where? Where?
Where? Where?

02:10.876 --> 02:11.674
Out there.

02:11.676 --> 02:14.077
- No.
- Werewolf.

02:22.121 --> 02:24.790
You guys hide in the alley.
I'll go get help.

02:35.534 --> 02:36.969
It's a dead end.

02:37.803 --> 02:40.737
Or it's gonna be for us. Look!

02:45.344 --> 02:47.278
What are we going to do?

02:51.151 --> 02:53.019
What we always do, Daphne.

02:54.687 --> 02:56.622
Solve this mystery.

03:07.067 --> 03:08.432
Yes!

03:08.434 --> 03:09.734
Just as I thought.

03:09.736 --> 03:12.704
Old man Wither's son,
young man Withers.

03:12.706 --> 03:15.106
- Of course.
- Great job, Fred.

03:15.108 --> 03:19.777
Once again, you and the Mystery
Machine have saved the day.

03:19.779 --> 03:21.579
But what about
the other monsters?

03:21.581 --> 03:23.548
I think it's time
to round 'em up.

03:23.550 --> 03:24.684
But first...

03:49.509 --> 03:51.576
Now, for a little Monster Mash.

And now, for the unmasking.

05:03.952 --> 05:07.020
Of course,
it's the whole Withers family.

05:07.022 --> 05:09.256
And we would've
gotten away with it, too,

05:09.258 --> 05:11.758
if it weren't
for you meddling kids.

05:11.760 --> 05:15.363
- Great going, Freddie.
- We all did it together.

05:15.365 --> 05:16.863
We're awesome.

05:16.865 --> 05:19.168
And don't forget
the Mystery Machine.

05:19.701 --> 05:20.633
Thank you.

05:27.443 --> 05:28.510
No!

05:31.114 --> 05:33.548
No!

05:34.417 --> 05:35.716
Freddie! Freddie!

05:35.718 --> 05:38.588
Mystery Machine!
Where are you?

05:40.323 --> 05:41.555
Freddie, are you okay?

05:41.557 --> 05:43.991
Yeah. I... I must've dozed off.

05:43.993 --> 05:46.927
I had a terrible dream that
I lost the Mystery Machine.

05:46.929 --> 05:50.264
Oh, man, what a nightmare.

05:50.266 --> 05:53.703
Um, Freddie.
The Mystery Machine is gone.

05:57.374 --> 06:00.543
Ah, that's right. I sold it.

06:03.679 --> 06:04.912
Don't worry, Fred.

06:04.914 --> 06:06.114
You aren't
the only one depressed

06:06.116 --> 06:08.483
about Mystery Inc.
closing up shop.

06:08.485 --> 06:13.922
I've got an entire section on my <i>Big
Blog of Mysteries</i> called <i>Unsolved Capers.</i>

06:13.924 --> 06:16.792
And I guess, now, they'll
forever remain unsolved.

06:16.794 --> 06:20.529
Which, to be honest,
makes me a little crazy.

06:24.401 --> 06:26.435
- You have a blog?
- Yes.

06:26.437 --> 06:29.873
Which you know,
because you've all subscribed, right?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.678
Listen, I know things
haven't been the same

06:36.680 --> 06:39.214
since the sheriff lectured us
about staying out of trouble.

06:39.216 --> 06:42.617
Uh, of course, some things
haven't changed at all.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.921
Forty-one, 42.

06:45.923 --> 06:48.623
Forty-two sandwiches.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.693
I bet I can eat 'em
in 42 seconds.

06:51.695 --> 06:53.096
Forty-one.

06:54.832 --> 06:56.698
Well, I don't know
about you guys.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.767
But I'm itching
to solve a mystery.

06:58.769 --> 07:01.437
But we don't have
a mystery to solve.

07:01.439 --> 07:03.372
Maybe we solved them all.

07:03.374 --> 07:05.808
<i>Eye-witnesses report a
mysterious, ghost-like creature</i>

07:05.810 --> 07:07.677
<i>that floated through the scene,</i>

07:07.679 --> 07:11.180
<i>promising horrible doom and
destruction to all onlookers.</i>

07:11.182 --> 07:13.282
They say
the vegetable cannery's

07:13.284 --> 07:16.319
haunted by a laughing
green gargantuan.

07:16.321 --> 07:19.355
That's true. Every night
the ancient ghost materializes

07:19.357 --> 07:22.692
and asks passers-by
how to program a VCR.

07:23.862 --> 07:26.064
- What's a VCR?
- I don't know.

07:27.399 --> 07:28.898
Well, gang,

07:28.900 --> 07:30.800
looks like we've got
an embarrassment of riches.

07:30.802 --> 07:33.537
Nope. No, siree.

07:33.539 --> 07:36.206
The sheriff told us
to stay out of trouble.

07:36.208 --> 07:38.674
From now on,
the only mystery I care about

07:38.676 --> 07:40.244
is how to get
the rest of the ketchup

07:40.246 --> 07:41.612
out of this bottle.

07:42.714 --> 07:43.781
Yeah.

07:45.551 --> 07:47.117
- Ketchup.
- But Shaggy...

07:47.119 --> 07:48.485
No buts.

07:48.487 --> 07:51.622
We've been to every haunted
house, park and carnival

07:51.624 --> 07:54.558
north, south, east and west
of the Mississippi.

07:54.560 --> 07:58.695
- Plus the Mississippi.
- Oh, yeah, the Riverboat Wraith.

07:58.697 --> 08:01.365
Well, we've had it up to here.

08:01.367 --> 08:04.868
I guess we have used you
as live bait a few times.

08:04.870 --> 08:07.271
A few times, daily.

08:07.273 --> 08:10.007
Well, maybe you do
deserve a break.

08:10.009 --> 08:13.311
Okay, Shaggy and Scooby,
you've made your point.

08:13.313 --> 08:14.345
No more mysteries.

08:14.347 --> 08:17.147
Ah-ah-ah-ah,
we've heard that before.

08:17.149 --> 08:19.317
We're gonna need
more than that.

08:19.319 --> 08:22.187
Raise your right hands
and swear.

08:22.189 --> 08:24.690
- That's a menu.
- Oh, they know.

08:25.258 --> 08:26.790
Repeat after me.

08:26.792 --> 08:28.825
We, like, solemnly swear,

08:28.827 --> 08:32.263
to, like, not solve
any more mysteries, man.

08:32.265 --> 08:34.164
We, like, solemnly swear,

08:34.167 --> 08:37.135
to, like, not solve
any more mysteries, man.

08:37.136 --> 08:41.405
And a promise is like a promise
that can't be unpromised

08:41.408 --> 08:46.144
unless the promiser,
gets permission from the promisee.

08:46.146 --> 08:47.946
You dig?

08:47.948 --> 08:51.416
And a promise is
like a promise that can't be unpromised

08:51.418 --> 08:54.486
unless the promiser...

08:56.957 --> 08:58.691
Uh... Yeah.

08:58.693 --> 09:00.359
Court adjourned.

09:01.329 --> 09:03.962
All right. It's official.

09:03.964 --> 09:06.398
Mystery Inc.
is closed for business.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.169
Good. Best to leave the mystery
solving for the professionals.

09:10.171 --> 09:11.769
You guys have been
running around,

09:11.771 --> 09:13.138
looking for trouble
for so long,

09:13.140 --> 09:15.541
you've forgotten
how to just be kids.

09:15.543 --> 09:17.042
Opening lemonade stands,

09:17.044 --> 09:19.445
playing kick the can,
talent shows in the barns,

09:19.447 --> 09:22.915
sock hops,
potato sack races, eh?

09:22.917 --> 09:24.850
He's not wrong.

09:24.852 --> 09:28.187
- About the sock hops?
- About everything.

09:28.189 --> 09:31.890
What you need to do is treat
yourself to a vacation.

09:31.892 --> 09:35.194
Get away from the city.
Go have some fun.

09:35.196 --> 09:38.397
You know, that sounds
like a great idea.

09:38.399 --> 09:41.735
Maybe it'll take
my mind off of her.

09:41.737 --> 09:43.802
- Seconded.
- Where could we go?

09:43.804 --> 09:46.205
Oh, I know.
Maybe an amusement park.

09:46.207 --> 09:46.939
No!

09:46.941 --> 09:49.074
No way, no how.

09:49.076 --> 09:51.877
No amusement parks
that ended up being haunted.

09:51.879 --> 09:53.812
Or zoos with demon animals.

09:53.814 --> 09:56.148
- No...
- Opera phantoms.

09:56.150 --> 10:00.086
Right. In fact, no theaters
with phantoms of any kind.

10:00.088 --> 10:01.521
We're gonna stay right here

10:01.523 --> 10:04.823
and watch our favorite show
on that TV.

10:07.262 --> 10:09.963
Hello, sweeties.
It's me, Elvira.

10:09.965 --> 10:13.133
Your spook-tacular hostess
with the mostest.

10:13.135 --> 10:15.035
Back with more
cinematic turkeys

10:15.037 --> 10:18.171
that really put
the horrible in horror.

10:18.173 --> 10:20.373
I never understood
why you two chickens

10:20.375 --> 10:22.942
love watching
these terrible movies.

10:22.944 --> 10:24.978
Because these cheesy monsters
are the only kind

10:24.980 --> 10:26.913
that Scoob and I
aren't afraid of.

10:26.915 --> 10:28.915
Cheese.

10:28.917 --> 10:33.253
Okay, before we start tonight's
monstrous marathon of mediocre movies,

10:33.255 --> 10:36.122
I got a spine-tingling
treat for you.

10:36.124 --> 10:38.592
My spine's tingling already.

10:38.594 --> 10:44.831
An anonymous sponsor has offered
to provide my most fang-tastic fan

10:44.833 --> 10:46.933
an all expense-paid vacation

10:46.935 --> 10:50.037
to a tropical paradise.

10:50.039 --> 10:52.473
Hey! An island retreat
sounds fun.

10:52.475 --> 10:53.907
It sure does.

10:53.909 --> 10:56.344
Like, nothing bad's ever
happened in paradise.

10:56.346 --> 10:59.180
I'd wish you good fortune,
but you're already out

10:59.182 --> 11:02.350
'cause I've seen our next
movie, <i>Predator Jones.</i>

11:02.352 --> 11:04.618
It'll take
your breath away.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.755
If you're lucky.

11:14.832 --> 11:16.567
Drum roll, please.

11:21.505 --> 11:25.239
Ladies and gentlemen,
my agent.

11:27.711 --> 11:29.143
Uh, where was I?

11:29.145 --> 11:31.179
Oh, right. The hapless rube...

11:31.181 --> 11:34.716
Uh, I mean,
vacation winner is...

11:34.718 --> 11:36.086
Is the suspense killing you?

11:37.920 --> 11:40.489
Con-bat-ulations to...

11:40.491 --> 11:42.259
Shaggy Rogers.

11:44.862 --> 11:48.764
Shaggy is allowed to bring up
to three guests along with him.

11:48.766 --> 11:50.000
And one pet.

11:50.769 --> 11:52.701
Pet? Really?

11:52.703 --> 11:54.903
Uh... Oh, that's
what it says here, folks.

11:54.905 --> 11:58.608
All right, after the break,
I'll answer your questions.

11:58.610 --> 12:00.710
See you soon, sweeties.

12:00.712 --> 12:04.212
We're going on vacation! We're going on vacation!

12:04.214 --> 12:07.015
Huh. That's awfully convenient.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.351
I... Uh, no. Never mind.

12:09.353 --> 12:13.288
We promised not to look for another
mystery and I keep my promises.

12:13.290 --> 12:17.427
I choose to believe
it is in no way mysterious.

12:19.062 --> 12:20.730
Yeah, I guess you're right.

12:20.732 --> 12:22.665
I wonder when we get to go.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.135
No mystery there.

12:24.968 --> 12:26.335
Like, right now.

12:26.337 --> 12:28.640
Yeah, now.

12:34.212 --> 12:38.181
Man, I could get used to island life.

12:38.183 --> 12:39.850
How about you, Scoob?

12:39.852 --> 12:42.153
Yeah, it's the best.

12:44.489 --> 12:47.891
Yep. It sure is nice
out here on the open sea.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.092
No mysteries,
no worries.

12:51.362 --> 12:52.565
What?

12:53.766 --> 12:55.466
Ah! It's not there.

12:55.468 --> 12:58.469
There is absolutely
nothing mysterious going on.

12:58.471 --> 12:59.536
Nothing.

12:59.538 --> 13:01.170
Whew. Yeah,
you promised the sheriff,

13:01.172 --> 13:03.206
not to mention
Shaggy and Scooby.

13:03.208 --> 13:04.908
Hey, Fred, what are you doing?

13:04.910 --> 13:06.810
Me? Uh, nothing.

13:06.812 --> 13:09.513
Not thinking about the stuff that
I promised not to think about.

13:09.515 --> 13:11.915
You?
You guys good?

13:11.917 --> 13:13.650
Don't worry, Fred.
We get it.

13:13.652 --> 13:16.286
It's hard to think about
anything but solving mysteries.

13:16.288 --> 13:18.121
Why, I was about to
try and solve the mystery

13:18.123 --> 13:20.357
of how all these trees
in this tropical paradise

13:20.359 --> 13:22.092
don't look tropical at all.

13:22.094 --> 13:25.028
But then I reminded her that
we promised Scooby and Shaggy

13:25.030 --> 13:26.798
we wouldn't
solve any mysteries.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.966
Big or small.

13:27.968 --> 13:30.200
I mean,
look how happy they are.

13:35.942 --> 13:37.140
I know.

13:37.142 --> 13:38.442
Why don't we ask
the ferry captain

13:38.444 --> 13:40.310
how long
before we reach the island?

13:40.312 --> 13:42.947
Then all we'll need to worry about
is how much fun we're having.

13:42.949 --> 13:44.216
Great idea.

13:47.654 --> 13:49.119
Excuse me, Captain.

13:49.121 --> 13:51.556
Where did you say this island
was that we're going to?

13:51.558 --> 13:55.762
The darkest reaches of Davy Jones's
Locker, if you ask me.

13:56.897 --> 13:59.130
Oh-kay.

13:59.132 --> 14:01.466
And I thought
I was having a bad day.

14:01.468 --> 14:04.536
You seem scared, sir.
Are you all right?

14:04.538 --> 14:07.105
I'm past scared or all right.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.340
Tomorrow is my last trip
to the island

14:09.342 --> 14:12.644
on account
of... the zombies.

14:12.646 --> 14:15.146
Gee... If I cared
about solving mysteries,

14:15.148 --> 14:17.148
I might be thinking
about that other time

14:17.150 --> 14:19.050
we went to an island
filled with zombies.

14:19.052 --> 14:22.688
It's too bad I'm no longer
using my <i>Big Blog of Mysteries.</i>

14:22.690 --> 14:25.991
Why one might find such
information about that encounter

14:25.993 --> 14:28.393
on the "unsolved" page.

14:28.395 --> 14:30.462
But, of course,
there's no need to do that.

14:30.464 --> 14:32.998
I'm sure when the captain
refers to zombies,

14:33.000 --> 14:34.600
he's just using slang.

14:34.602 --> 14:36.936
He's probably
just talking about them.

14:41.742 --> 14:45.109
I think we may have reached
our sausage limit for the day.

14:45.111 --> 14:46.280
I agree.

14:54.455 --> 14:56.388
We're here.
But mind you,

14:56.390 --> 14:59.491
I'll be returning tomorrow
for the last time.

14:59.493 --> 15:02.261
Just before
the sun sets low.

15:02.263 --> 15:05.199
You'd be wise
to be back aboard.

15:05.801 --> 15:07.335
Or else...

15:08.670 --> 15:11.270
Or else we'll have
way too much fun.

15:11.272 --> 15:12.371
Am I right, gang?

15:12.373 --> 15:13.709
Thanks for the ride.

15:20.247 --> 15:22.916
See, it actually
does look tropical.

15:22.918 --> 15:24.451
No need to worry at all.

15:24.453 --> 15:27.420
And look,
native islanders.

15:27.422 --> 15:30.692
I bet they're here to give
us a real island greeting.

15:31.526 --> 15:33.927
Hi, I'm Fred. And, uh...

15:33.929 --> 15:36.365
Get out.

15:37.299 --> 15:38.698
Hmm, that's odd.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.734
Did he just say
to get out?

15:40.736 --> 15:42.602
I choose to believe that it's
some sort of island greeting,

15:42.604 --> 15:44.437
- like <i>aloha.</i>
- Gotcha.

15:44.439 --> 15:46.408
Get out to you too.

15:47.043 --> 15:48.475
Get out.

15:48.477 --> 15:50.845
Yes. Get out, everyone.

15:50.847 --> 15:53.382
Oh, so friendly.
I just love island life.

15:55.051 --> 15:56.917
Get out.

15:56.919 --> 15:59.252
Thanks. That's what
we're trying to do.

15:59.254 --> 16:01.589
Get out
and get to relaxing.

16:01.591 --> 16:04.259
Yeah, uh, get to relaxing.

16:06.663 --> 16:08.129
Get out.

16:08.131 --> 16:09.563
You must go
before it's too late.

16:09.565 --> 16:11.866
The island is infested
with zombies.

16:11.868 --> 16:16.003
And if you don't leave,
you could become one too.

16:16.005 --> 16:18.541
Did you say zombies?

16:20.877 --> 16:24.779
Well, then if I was a person that
was curious about such phenomena

16:24.781 --> 16:27.149
I'd probably
want to investigate that.

16:27.151 --> 16:30.718
But since I'm not,
I guess I'll, uh...

16:30.720 --> 16:31.888
I'll just go now.

16:35.658 --> 16:36.693
Tourists.

16:59.883 --> 17:02.251
This is a terrible van.

17:03.487 --> 17:05.353
I'm just saying
as vans go,

17:05.355 --> 17:06.655
this one's pretty basic.

17:06.656 --> 17:08.924
One color, no flower decals,

17:08.925 --> 17:11.492
no name written on the side,
I mean...

17:11.494 --> 17:13.096
What's it even called?

17:13.098 --> 17:14.531
The van.

17:15.232 --> 17:16.867
Mmm-hmm.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.637
Hmm. Boy, can
those two relax.

17:22.638 --> 17:26.809
Yeah, I guess small talk
isn't our thing, is it?

17:26.810 --> 17:28.677
Usually we're trying
to figure out

17:28.679 --> 17:31.948
how to escape some monster
or who did what, where.

17:31.950 --> 17:36.418
We've never really
just sat around and talked.

17:36.420 --> 17:37.887
Well, maybe we should start.

17:37.889 --> 17:40.257
Who saw
the big game last night?

17:46.197 --> 17:47.497
So, Velma,

17:47.499 --> 17:49.365
uh, what's your
favorite thing to do

17:49.367 --> 17:50.835
besides solving mysteries?

17:51.903 --> 17:53.905
There is nothing else.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.388
Scooby, how are you, buddy?

18:12.557 --> 18:14.624
Look out!

18:33.546 --> 18:35.311
- That's weird.
- What, Velma?

18:35.313 --> 18:38.315
It looks as though someone
deliberately cut this tree down

18:38.317 --> 18:40.184
and pushed it
into the road.

18:40.186 --> 18:43.387
And from the looks of it,
it seems like they used something sharp.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.623
Like a claw.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.258
Hmm?

18:47.260 --> 18:50.494
Uh, like something we don't
have to worry about.

18:50.496 --> 18:54.032
Absolutely. I mean,
trees fall all the time.

18:54.034 --> 18:55.668
Even trees made out of...

18:56.635 --> 18:58.002
- Plastic?
- Listen!

18:58.004 --> 19:00.637
Dudes, I know
there's mysterious stuff

19:00.639 --> 19:02.073
around every corner,

19:02.075 --> 19:03.676
but you promised.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.476
You're right, Shaggy.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.113
And we are going to keep
our promise no matter what.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.048
Right, gang?

19:10.050 --> 19:12.150
Right. No matter what.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.952
Right. No matter what.

19:13.954 --> 19:15.220
Good.

19:15.222 --> 19:18.424
Now, how about
we get back to that vacation?

19:27.033 --> 19:28.833
Anybody else hear that?

19:29.636 --> 19:32.739
Sorry, that's my phone.

19:34.841 --> 19:39.178
Anyway, looks like something's
slashed my van's tire.

19:39.180 --> 19:40.912
- Good.
- What?

19:40.914 --> 19:42.248
Uh... Nothing.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.949
Eh, probably some sharp rocks.

19:43.951 --> 19:47.219
- Or claws. I mean, a nail.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:47.221 --> 19:48.988
Hmm.

19:48.990 --> 19:51.257
Right. Nothing
out of the ordinary.

19:51.259 --> 19:53.759
I guess we'll just have to
hike the rest of the way.

19:53.761 --> 19:56.594
Ah! What a great way
to start a vacation.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.132
Right, gang?

19:59.066 --> 19:59.967
Yes.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.470
This is really going great.

20:18.019 --> 20:20.186
Moonstar Island Resort?

20:20.188 --> 20:21.620
Haven't we stayed here before?

20:21.622 --> 20:24.090
I'm sure it's just
part of a chain.

20:24.092 --> 20:26.959
I think Daphne's
thinking of Moonscar.

20:26.961 --> 20:29.495
The island we visited
with the zombies.

20:29.497 --> 20:31.932
And the cat people. And danger.

20:31.934 --> 20:34.435
The island
that's clearly not this one.

20:39.007 --> 20:40.740
Say,

20:40.742 --> 20:42.175
are you guys suggesting

20:42.177 --> 20:44.476
that there's something
mysterious going on here?

20:44.478 --> 20:45.845
- No.
- Not at all.

20:45.847 --> 20:47.914
- She was just, uh...
- Reminiscing.

20:47.916 --> 20:51.351
Yeah, about that summer when I
was working at that TV station

20:51.353 --> 20:52.519
<i>for my school project.</i>

20:52.521 --> 20:54.220
<i>Like, yeah, we know.</i>

20:54.222 --> 20:55.655
<i>I was determined</i>

20:55.657 --> 20:57.524
<i>to find an actual
supernatural case</i>

20:57.526 --> 20:59.292
<i>not just another guy in a mask.</i>

20:59.294 --> 21:01.094
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

21:01.096 --> 21:04.731
<i>We searched everywhere,
including Moonscar Island.</i>

21:04.733 --> 21:06.466
<i>Like,
we know all this.</i>

21:06.468 --> 21:09.136
<i>There we met a series
of very unusual people.</i>

21:09.138 --> 21:11.405
<i>Lena, Simone, Jacques,</i>

21:11.407 --> 21:13.540
<i>and who could forget
Snakebite Scrubbs.</i>

21:13.542 --> 21:14.908
<i>Not us.</i>

21:14.910 --> 21:16.676
<i>'Cause, like,
we were there.</i>

21:16.678 --> 21:18.279
<i>We arrived at a house</i>

21:18.281 --> 21:20.880
<i>that looked
a lot like this hotel.</i>

21:20.882 --> 21:23.184
<i>But then we were
attacked by zombies.</i>

21:23.186 --> 21:24.885
<i>But we found out
that the zombies</i>

21:24.887 --> 21:26.954
<i>were actually victims
of the cat people.</i>

21:26.956 --> 21:28.990
<i>who had been draining innocent
bystanders of their life force</i>

21:28.992 --> 21:32.093
<i>in order to stay alive
for over 200 years.</i>

21:32.095 --> 21:33.394
<i>Right.</i>

21:33.396 --> 21:35.363
<i>The cat people
were originally villagers</i>

21:35.365 --> 21:37.631
<i>who survived the pirate
Morgan Moonscar</i>

21:37.633 --> 21:40.835
<i>when he landed on the island
to bury his treasure.</i>

21:40.837 --> 21:44.138
<i>The villagers had called
upon their cat-god or something</i>

21:44.140 --> 21:45.706
<i>to get revenge.</i>

21:45.708 --> 21:48.542
<i>So he changed them
into werecats.</i>

21:48.544 --> 21:49.478
<i>Werecats.</i>

21:51.247 --> 21:53.147
<i>They were going to
steal our life-force, too.</i>

21:53.149 --> 21:55.783
<i>Something they could only do
during the harvest moon.</i>

21:55.785 --> 21:59.123
<i>But we were able to stop them
and they melted into nothing.</i>

22:01.724 --> 22:03.824
You know, I was
never really satisfied

22:03.826 --> 22:05.626
with how that whole thing
turned out.

22:05.628 --> 22:06.927
Since we're back,

22:06.929 --> 22:08.964
we could break
this thing wide open.

22:08.966 --> 22:11.835
Break? As in break a promise?

22:13.103 --> 22:17.739
Besides, this says Moonstar.
Not Moonscar.

22:17.741 --> 22:20.308
Plus, did you see
the palm trees and the sand?

22:20.310 --> 22:24.613
The only thing we have to do
on this island, man, is relax.

22:42.467 --> 22:44.866
It's beautiful.

22:44.868 --> 22:47.738
Thank you.
It's my pride and joy.

22:48.772 --> 22:50.039
And you are?

22:50.041 --> 22:52.408
I'm Shaggy Rogers,
the contest winner.

22:52.410 --> 22:54.110
Shaggy Rogers?

22:54.112 --> 22:55.044
Wonderful name.

22:55.046 --> 22:57.313
I'm Alan,
the hotel manager.

22:57.315 --> 22:58.713
We've been expecting you.

22:58.715 --> 23:02.285
Welcome to
Moonstar Island Resort.

23:02.287 --> 23:03.986
Why don't you
sign our guest book,

23:03.988 --> 23:05.620
while I check you in.

23:05.622 --> 23:06.891
Happily.

23:10.495 --> 23:13.996
Hmm. I'm sure there's a
perfectly reasonable explanation

23:13.998 --> 23:15.932
for the guestbook pages
being ripped out.

23:15.934 --> 23:17.102
Isn't there, Alan?

23:18.103 --> 23:19.137
Moths.

23:21.639 --> 23:23.373
Now, if you'll follow me,

23:23.375 --> 23:24.807
here at Moonstar,

23:24.809 --> 23:26.943
we take pride
in our luxury accommodations,

23:26.945 --> 23:28.845
and the safety
of our guests.

23:28.847 --> 23:30.113
As you can see,

23:30.115 --> 23:32.048
we have the highest
security standards

23:32.050 --> 23:34.151
to make sure you have
a pleasant stay.

23:34.153 --> 23:36.786
Wow. That's a lot of cameras.

23:36.788 --> 23:39.456
Only for your protection,
I assure you.

23:39.458 --> 23:41.325
Why would we
need protection?

23:41.327 --> 23:44.660
Gee, Fred, it sounds like you're
asking about something mysterious.

23:44.662 --> 23:47.397
You wouldn't be doing
that, now, would you?

23:47.399 --> 23:49.299
No, Shaggy, not at all.

23:49.301 --> 23:50.801
Just curious.

23:50.803 --> 23:52.803
This is my wonderful staff.

23:52.805 --> 23:57.007
The finest of the fine.
The cream of the crop, as they say.

23:57.009 --> 24:01.278
That's Jack, Linda,
Mona and Bugbite Stubbs.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.715
They'll be here to help you,
should the need arise.

24:04.717 --> 24:06.618
Why, those names
don't sound at all

24:06.620 --> 24:08.886
like the other names
from the other island adventure

24:08.888 --> 24:10.287
that we're not talking about.

24:10.289 --> 24:13.290
Well, when you hear
something suspicious,

24:13.292 --> 24:16.461
I guess the best thing to do
is ignore it.

24:19.299 --> 24:22.067
Huh? Everyone seems so...

24:22.735 --> 24:24.135
Attractive?

24:24.137 --> 24:26.072
Yes, well,
that's because we have...

24:29.209 --> 24:30.243
standards.

24:36.782 --> 24:38.116
But soft!

24:38.118 --> 24:40.885
What light
through yonder window breaks?

24:40.887 --> 24:44.422
It is the east,
and you are the sun.

24:44.424 --> 24:46.659
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

24:46.661 --> 24:49.796
Oh! Nice to meet you too.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.934
Say, you wouldn't happen to have a
place to eat around here, would you?

24:55.936 --> 24:59.405
All this excitement
has me and my buddy famished.

24:59.407 --> 25:02.308
Yes, and it's all free.

25:02.310 --> 25:03.708
Free?

25:03.710 --> 25:06.811
Yes, and we serve only the
finest of fine cuisine.

25:06.813 --> 25:08.447
Including...

25:08.449 --> 25:12.119
an unlimited supply
of gold wrapped Scooby snacks.

25:12.719 --> 25:14.587
Am I in heaven?

25:16.090 --> 25:19.191
Yes, and heaven
is just offstage right.

25:19.193 --> 25:20.794
All you can eat.

25:25.533 --> 25:27.766
We'll take that as a challenge.

25:29.136 --> 25:32.139
- Right, Scooby-Doo?
- Challenge accepted.

26:02.003 --> 26:04.704
Now, are there any
questions, concerns?

26:04.706 --> 26:08.375
- Ow!
- I don't know, Daphne, any concerns?

26:08.377 --> 26:10.910
Maybe about what might
be on the island?

26:10.912 --> 26:13.446
Something lurking
in the shadows?

26:13.448 --> 26:15.048
But we are not worried.

26:15.050 --> 26:16.549
Not even a little bit curious

26:16.551 --> 26:19.519
about what the ferry captain
told us on the way here.

26:19.521 --> 26:21.187
And what is that?

26:21.189 --> 26:23.189
Oh, he mentioned
something about the island

26:23.191 --> 26:25.327
being filled with zombies.

26:31.166 --> 26:32.966
We mustn't talk about that.

26:32.968 --> 26:36.404
It is the island's, uh,
greatest mystery.

26:36.406 --> 26:38.238
Mystery.

26:39.309 --> 26:40.741
Which means...

26:40.743 --> 26:44.846
Maybe we should, uh,
join the guys for some food.

26:49.686 --> 26:51.485
Oh, boy.

26:51.487 --> 26:54.155
I think I hurt my neck on that
last go-around on the buffet.

26:54.157 --> 26:57.958
Well, might I suggest
a nice, relaxing massage?

26:57.960 --> 26:59.226
Yes, you might.

26:59.228 --> 27:01.862
I'm up for anything
nice and relaxing.

27:01.864 --> 27:03.230
Me too.

27:03.232 --> 27:06.167
Excellent.
We've got a five star masseuse,

27:06.169 --> 27:10.438
who will work any knots
out of your food-laden bodies.

27:10.440 --> 27:11.439
Uh, shiatsu?

27:11.441 --> 27:13.242
No, Great Dane.

27:15.378 --> 27:19.080
This bathrobe is the comfiest
thing I have ever felt.

27:19.082 --> 27:20.451
What do you think, Scoob?

27:21.785 --> 27:23.052
Uh-huh.

27:29.593 --> 27:31.526
Wow. This is nice.

27:31.528 --> 27:35.532
I can feel the years of fear and
anxiety floating away already.

27:40.070 --> 27:42.604
Look, Scooby-Doo,
our masseuses are here.

27:42.606 --> 27:45.642
It's time to loosen up
the old muscles.

27:46.510 --> 27:48.011
Oh, fabo.

27:58.155 --> 28:00.055
I know, not much to look at.

28:00.057 --> 28:02.560
You really have your work
cut out for you, huh?

28:06.664 --> 28:09.601
Wow! Your hands
are really cold, dude.

28:10.435 --> 28:13.003
Ooh, freezing.

28:19.477 --> 28:22.612
Scooby, I know that the gang
is having a hard time

28:22.614 --> 28:24.946
not jumping at shadows
and solving mysteries,

28:24.948 --> 28:26.716
but I think
it's for the best.

28:26.718 --> 28:28.117
Maybe... Aah!

28:28.119 --> 28:30.088
They should get a massage, too.

28:31.022 --> 28:33.489
Ow! A little softer, would you?

28:33.491 --> 28:36.626
I have really sensitive skin
due to over nutrition.

28:36.628 --> 28:38.630
Not me. Dig in.

28:40.298 --> 28:41.164
Ow!

28:41.166 --> 28:42.900
Just a little lighter, please.

28:42.902 --> 28:45.501
I'm extremely fragile.

28:47.105 --> 28:49.642
Zombies!

28:50.275 --> 28:51.209
Zombies?

29:04.657 --> 29:06.022
And over here,

29:06.024 --> 29:08.792
we have our shuffleboard room,
pool room,

29:08.794 --> 29:10.262
and finally, garage.

29:10.763 --> 29:12.061
Jeepers.

29:12.063 --> 29:13.931
You sure have
thought of everything.

29:13.933 --> 29:17.100
Yes, and we have
so much more in store.

29:23.844 --> 29:25.211
No, it couldn't be.

29:28.013 --> 29:30.681
Sure sounds like her,
but it's not.

29:30.683 --> 29:34.284
It just can't be.
All right, hold on, Fred.

29:37.156 --> 29:40.224
Don't open that door.
You promised.

29:50.303 --> 29:52.204
Huh?

29:53.940 --> 29:55.208
Are you all right?

29:57.911 --> 29:59.544
Massage. Attack.

29:59.546 --> 30:00.747
Cold hands.

30:04.885 --> 30:08.686
I'm afraid your friend must have
hurt himself during the fall.

30:08.688 --> 30:10.788
I can't understand
a word he's saying.

30:10.790 --> 30:13.826
No. They're saying
that during their massage,

30:13.828 --> 30:17.662
two zombies appeared and
attacked them with cold hands.

30:19.499 --> 30:21.499
How could you
possibly know that?

30:21.501 --> 30:24.304
Oh, I'm fluent
in panic-Shaggy and Scooby.

30:25.472 --> 30:26.672
Zombies?

30:26.674 --> 30:28.807
Then the legend is true.
We've...

30:28.809 --> 30:32.011
Got a case of someone who has
an overactive imagination.

30:32.013 --> 30:33.779
- Huh?
- Huh?

30:33.781 --> 30:36.281
You heard the part
about the zombie, right?

30:36.283 --> 30:38.517
Of course,
but as a woman of science,

30:38.519 --> 30:40.920
I know there is
no such thing as...

30:40.922 --> 30:42.588
"zombies."

30:42.590 --> 30:44.055
There isn't?

30:44.057 --> 30:45.524
No, of course not.

30:45.526 --> 30:47.826
So it stands to reason
that what you saw

30:47.828 --> 30:49.495
wasn't a zombie at all.

30:49.497 --> 30:51.263
But what else
could it have been?

30:51.265 --> 30:53.599
Well, since it was
at the spa,

30:53.601 --> 30:57.871
I can only assume it was probably
other guests with mud masks on.

30:57.873 --> 31:00.072
Mud masks? Really?

31:00.074 --> 31:01.574
It does make more sense

31:01.576 --> 31:03.910
than flesh-eating,
undead monsters.

31:03.912 --> 31:05.146
Mm-hmm.

31:05.981 --> 31:07.279
Ugh.

31:07.281 --> 31:09.615
Daphne's right,
it was probably nothing.

31:09.617 --> 31:12.418
I mean, if there was
a real zombie lurking around,

31:12.420 --> 31:15.589
Scooby and Shaggy
would be nowhere near...

31:15.591 --> 31:17.958
Hey! Where's Scooby and Shaggy?

31:17.960 --> 31:20.159
Like, I know
where this is going, buddy.

31:20.161 --> 31:22.762
First, there's nothing
and then...

31:22.764 --> 31:23.964
There's something.

31:23.966 --> 31:25.264
Exactly.

31:25.266 --> 31:27.132
I say we hide out here.

31:27.134 --> 31:29.402
And only venture out
to grab some food.

31:29.404 --> 31:30.770
Speaking of which,

31:30.772 --> 31:33.907
I've got my emergency
hiding snack satchel

31:33.909 --> 31:35.508
for just such an occasion.

31:35.510 --> 31:37.911
Good thinking, Shaggy.

31:37.913 --> 31:41.314
I know. Like, no one
will ever find us down here.

31:50.793 --> 31:51.660
Ow!

31:59.468 --> 32:00.402
Oh?

32:01.804 --> 32:04.672
Hey! Haven't we
been here before?

32:04.674 --> 32:05.875
Hmm?

32:08.143 --> 32:09.812
Cat people.

32:10.947 --> 32:12.113
Cat people?

32:12.115 --> 32:13.414
But that doesn't
make any sense.

32:13.416 --> 32:15.282
We're on a completely
different island.

32:17.152 --> 32:18.919
Huh?

32:18.921 --> 32:20.287
Scooby-Doo,

32:20.289 --> 32:22.289
please tell me
that's your stomach.

32:22.291 --> 32:23.493
Uh-uh.

32:30.700 --> 32:31.699
Not again.

32:40.911 --> 32:42.944
Scooby? Shaggy?

32:42.946 --> 32:44.946
How long are we going
to keep this promise

32:44.948 --> 32:46.748
to not solve any mysteries?

32:46.750 --> 32:49.483
I mean, there's a lot of strange
things happening around here.

32:49.485 --> 32:52.954
And I'm dying to figure out
what is going on.

32:52.956 --> 32:53.955
Bad choice of words.

32:53.957 --> 32:55.424
You're choosing words

32:55.426 --> 32:57.826
and I'm barely
keeping it together over here.

32:57.828 --> 33:02.064
I mean, did you see the way the
staff reacted to the word "zombie"?

33:02.066 --> 33:03.832
I know.

33:03.834 --> 33:06.702
But we can't let
Scooby and Shaggy down.

33:06.704 --> 33:09.138
They've followed us
through a million mysteries.

33:09.140 --> 33:12.774
The least we can do is stick our
heads in the sand and avoid this one.

33:12.776 --> 33:16.478
I know you're right,
but it's so hard.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.081
Maybe after we find
Scooby and Shaggy

33:18.083 --> 33:20.449
we can occupy our minds
with something else.

33:20.451 --> 33:22.051
Like shuffleboard

33:22.053 --> 33:25.353
or whatever you're
supposed to do on vacation.

33:25.355 --> 33:27.190
Sounds like a plan, Velma.

33:27.192 --> 33:29.293
Scooby! Shaggy!

33:32.097 --> 33:34.362
Scoob! Shaggy!

33:57.689 --> 33:58.556
Huh?

34:01.193 --> 34:02.825
Find anything,
Freddie?

34:02.827 --> 34:04.660
Nothing.

34:04.662 --> 34:06.429
She's not out there at all.

34:06.431 --> 34:08.065
It's just a trick of the light.

34:08.067 --> 34:10.934
- She?
- Uh, I mean they.

34:10.936 --> 34:12.400
They're not out there.

34:12.402 --> 34:14.138
Did I say she?

34:14.139 --> 34:15.471
That's weird.

34:15.473 --> 34:17.875
But, no, not like,
this is a mystery weird.

34:22.848 --> 34:23.781
That should do it.

34:23.783 --> 34:25.481
What's gotten into you two?

34:25.483 --> 34:27.217
Like, what we've been saying.

34:27.219 --> 34:29.318
Zombies. They're everywhere.

34:29.320 --> 34:30.621
Zombies?

34:30.623 --> 34:32.856
We must run. Hide.

34:32.858 --> 34:35.092
Boys. We've already
been through this.

34:35.094 --> 34:37.995
There's no proof that zombies
are haunting the island.

34:37.996 --> 34:39.530
Let's be reasonable.

34:42.001 --> 34:43.936
It's coming from outside.

34:59.186 --> 35:01.052
Do those look like mud masks?

35:01.054 --> 35:02.319
Kind of.

35:02.321 --> 35:04.090
What are we going to do?
We're doomed.

35:05.792 --> 35:07.391
Uh...
Let me try that again.

35:07.393 --> 35:10.561
What are we going to do?
We're doomed!

35:10.563 --> 35:11.863
So much better.

35:15.135 --> 35:18.303
I'm sorry,
I must have fainted.

35:18.305 --> 35:19.637
What are we going to do?

35:21.508 --> 35:24.309
I was wondering
if there was any dessert or...

35:24.311 --> 35:26.911
Dessert? At a time like this?

35:26.913 --> 35:29.480
There's a horde of zombies
outside this hotel

35:29.482 --> 35:31.115
and you want to eat
chocolate pudding?

35:31.117 --> 35:33.585
Chocolate pudding?
That sounds great.

35:33.587 --> 35:36.188
- I'll take one.
- Me too.

35:36.190 --> 35:39.526
How can you think
of eating at a time like this?

35:40.061 --> 35:40.993
Yeah.

35:40.995 --> 35:41.963
Don't think...

35:42.929 --> 35:44.230
do.

35:44.232 --> 35:46.831
- We don't even have pudding.
- We brought our own.

35:46.833 --> 35:50.002
Regardless, the zombies
are gonna be here any second.

35:53.140 --> 35:55.076
Or, maybe minute.

36:00.848 --> 36:02.413
Half hour, tops.

36:02.415 --> 36:05.383
Aren't you
professional mystery-solvers?

36:05.385 --> 36:08.487
Can't you solve the mystery
that's happening right outside?

36:08.489 --> 36:11.523
We'd really,
really love to help.

36:11.525 --> 36:13.459
But we promised
Scooby and Shaggy

36:13.461 --> 36:15.661
that we wouldn't
solve any more mysteries.

36:15.663 --> 36:19.565
And a promise is a promise
is a promise.

36:19.567 --> 36:20.968
Remember, guys?

36:22.837 --> 36:26.805
I mean, uh, the only thing
that could break a promise

36:26.807 --> 36:29.242
is the person that they
promised the promise to

36:29.244 --> 36:32.178
saying that they could
break the promise.

36:32.180 --> 36:33.846
I get it. I don't.

36:33.848 --> 36:36.349
That's right. The people
that made us promise

36:36.351 --> 36:39.718
just have to say it's okay
for us to break that promise.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.521
What? Who cares about promises?

36:42.523 --> 36:44.357
There are zombies outside.

36:44.359 --> 36:45.625
We care.

36:45.627 --> 36:47.426
We made Shaggy
and Scooby a promise

36:47.428 --> 36:49.396
and we're gonna stand by it.

36:51.366 --> 36:53.669
Oh!

36:56.672 --> 36:59.407
We hereby exercise
the takesies-baksies clause

36:59.409 --> 37:02.008
to release you of the promise
to stop solving mysteries.

37:02.010 --> 37:04.544
- Oh, thank you, guys.
- Oh, finally.

37:05.747 --> 37:07.214
Wonderful.

37:07.216 --> 37:09.482
Now, the zombies!

37:09.484 --> 37:10.684
First things first,

37:10.686 --> 37:12.253
we need to secure
the perimeter.

37:12.255 --> 37:14.487
- I'll get the doors and windows.
- And Fred...

37:14.489 --> 37:18.159
I know. It's trap time.

37:53.263 --> 37:54.862
Lucky for us,

37:54.864 --> 37:57.265
zombies aren't the fastest
movers in the world.

38:00.503 --> 38:02.337
Um, should we be worried?

38:02.339 --> 38:05.541
Negative. Everything is
going exactly to plan.

38:10.981 --> 38:13.647
- It's quiet.
- Maybe they're sleeping.

38:13.649 --> 38:15.683
I get sleepy when I eat turkey.

38:15.685 --> 38:18.889
Maybe they ate
some turkey brains?

38:27.331 --> 38:30.565
Oh, no! They're all
pushing on the front door.

38:30.567 --> 38:31.733
Right where we want them.

38:31.735 --> 38:33.070
Now, Fred!

38:43.381 --> 38:44.414
You did it.

38:44.416 --> 38:46.950
I can't believe that worked.

38:55.626 --> 38:58.494
Say, do you smell something?

38:58.496 --> 39:00.764
Mm. Smells like barbeque.

39:02.666 --> 39:03.598
Fire!

39:12.610 --> 39:14.612
What's happening
to the zombies?

39:16.648 --> 39:18.681
They're... They're melting.

39:18.683 --> 39:20.983
Uh-huh. Just as I thought.

39:20.985 --> 39:22.618
These aren't zombies.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.789
They're witches.

39:26.292 --> 39:27.657
'Cause melting.

39:27.659 --> 39:29.727
No? Nobody else?

39:30.329 --> 39:31.930
Okay.

39:36.634 --> 39:38.569
Jack is a zombie?

39:38.571 --> 39:40.805
He's not the only one.

39:41.507 --> 39:43.273
Mona? Linda?

39:43.275 --> 39:46.543
I'm aghast.
Aghast, I tell you.

39:46.545 --> 39:49.279
No, Alan,
I don't think you are.

39:49.281 --> 39:50.646
What do you mean, Velma?

39:50.648 --> 39:52.149
It should be obvious.

39:52.151 --> 39:54.184
Would you like
to start us off, Daphne?

39:54.186 --> 39:55.618
My pleasure.

39:55.620 --> 39:58.622
It first started when Shaggy
and Scooby won that contest.

39:58.624 --> 40:00.724
<i>It was way too coincidental,</i>

40:00.726 --> 40:02.659
<i>and in fact,
was probably planned.</i>

40:02.661 --> 40:05.095
<i>And then the trees
leading up to the island,</i>

40:05.097 --> 40:06.964
<i>looked like they'd be
more at home in a swamp</i>

40:06.966 --> 40:09.032
<i>than in a tropical paradise.</i>

40:09.034 --> 40:11.569
But there are palm trees
on this island.

40:11.571 --> 40:12.803
How do you explain that?

40:12.805 --> 40:14.071
Plastic palm trees.

40:14.073 --> 40:15.939
And then,
remember when we arrived?

40:15.941 --> 40:19.511
and Mona couldn't help telling
Shaggy and Scooby, "Yes, and..."

40:19.513 --> 40:22.880
<i>That's an improv technique
taught in acting classes.</i>

40:22.882 --> 40:24.516
Yes, and...

40:24.518 --> 40:26.717
<i>she also told them
the buffet was stage right.</i>

40:26.719 --> 40:28.652
Which is also a theater term.

40:28.654 --> 40:30.054
That's right.

40:30.056 --> 40:32.056
And when Jack
quoted Shakespeare to Daphne

40:32.058 --> 40:35.360
it was from one of the most common
monologues used for theater auditions.

40:35.362 --> 40:36.660
But soft!

40:36.662 --> 40:38.897
What light
through yonder window breaks?

40:38.899 --> 40:42.066
Plus everyone
was way too good-looking.

40:42.068 --> 40:45.503
The men have perfect jaws,
the girls perfect hair.

40:45.505 --> 40:47.105
It's almost too perfect.

40:47.107 --> 40:49.174
And don't forget the cameras.

40:49.176 --> 40:50.241
That's right.

40:50.243 --> 40:52.110
There were cameras
all over the hotel.

40:52.112 --> 40:54.714
And the most
important clue.

40:55.348 --> 40:56.582
The guest book.

40:57.784 --> 40:59.317
There were pages
ripped out of it.

40:59.319 --> 41:02.187
Pages that had the signatures
of previous guests,

41:02.189 --> 41:04.189
including us.

41:04.191 --> 41:06.124
Uh-huh.

41:06.126 --> 41:08.327
This isn't
a tropical island at all.

41:08.329 --> 41:10.462
This is Moonscar Island.

41:10.464 --> 41:12.697
Or as I called it in my blog,

41:12.699 --> 41:14.933
Zombie Island.

41:14.935 --> 41:18.337
But the name of the hotel,
it's totally different.

41:18.339 --> 41:19.939
Not exactly.

41:19.941 --> 41:21.507
They changed one letter

41:21.509 --> 41:23.741
and they didn't even
do that very well.

41:23.743 --> 41:25.678
So what does that all mean?

41:25.680 --> 41:27.148
Isn't it obvious?

41:29.016 --> 41:31.383
That this isn't just a hotel,

41:31.385 --> 41:32.585
this is a location,

41:32.587 --> 41:34.320
and we are in...

41:34.322 --> 41:35.421
A movie.

41:35.423 --> 41:38.159
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

41:41.896 --> 41:44.298
You ruined everything.
Everything.

41:48.269 --> 41:49.001
Thanks?

41:49.003 --> 41:50.370
Thank you.

41:50.372 --> 41:53.105
You're right, Velma.
This is a movie.

41:53.107 --> 41:55.808
And I'm not just
Alan, the hotel manager,

41:55.810 --> 41:59.147
I'm Alan, the film director.

42:00.582 --> 42:02.082
Alan Smithee?

42:02.084 --> 42:04.985
Sure. And this was
to be my greatest masterpiece.

42:04.987 --> 42:07.721
Something that felt true,
that felt real.

42:07.723 --> 42:09.689
But now, it's ruined.

42:09.691 --> 42:11.224
Forever.

42:16.999 --> 42:18.865
But why us?

42:18.867 --> 42:22.035
Well, as you know, the only thing
studios care about these days

42:22.037 --> 42:25.238
are franchises, like those
found-footage horror movies

42:25.240 --> 42:27.274
that spawn a bazillion sequels.

42:27.276 --> 42:29.209
So I thought
I could do my own.

42:29.211 --> 42:31.712
In my research
for the next big thing,

42:31.714 --> 42:33.748
I happened upon your website,

42:33.750 --> 42:35.982
the <i>Big Blog of Mysteries.</i>

42:35.984 --> 42:37.420
We have a blog?

42:39.522 --> 42:40.554
What?

42:40.556 --> 42:42.292
As I was saying...

42:44.160 --> 42:47.161
<i>There is a section</i>
<i>called</i> Unsolved Capers.

42:47.163 --> 42:50.164
The most popular part,
if I don't mind saying so.

42:50.166 --> 42:53.567
<i>And in it, it has all this
stuff about a reluctant werewolf,</i>

42:53.569 --> 42:56.771
<i>and the tale of Zombie Island.</i>

42:56.773 --> 42:58.639
But Zombie Island
wasn't unsolved.

42:58.641 --> 43:00.141
The cat people disintegrated

43:00.143 --> 43:02.510
while the zombies went back
to an eternal rest.

43:02.512 --> 43:04.578
There is nothing
about what you just said

43:04.580 --> 43:05.714
that sounds solved.

43:05.716 --> 43:07.716
But you only
used the zombies.

43:07.718 --> 43:08.916
What about the cat people?

43:08.918 --> 43:10.851
Cat people, werewolves...

43:10.853 --> 43:12.987
Those costumes
are too expensive.

43:12.989 --> 43:14.589
Zombies, however,

43:14.591 --> 43:17.325
are as cheap as a bucket
of plastic prosthetic makeup.

43:17.327 --> 43:19.695
So I decided to make a movie.

43:19.697 --> 43:21.329
But first I had to figure out

43:21.331 --> 43:23.465
how to get you
back to the island.

43:23.467 --> 43:27.068
<i>I'd read about Shaggy and
Scooby's love of TV's Elvira.</i>

43:27.070 --> 43:28.836
<i>The horror hostess
with the mostest.</i>

43:28.838 --> 43:31.306
<i>And since all Hollywood
weirdos know each other,</i>

43:31.308 --> 43:33.475
<i>I called her up
and asked her to help sell</i>

43:33.477 --> 43:36.244
<i>the whole vacation
getaway ruse.</i>

43:36.246 --> 43:38.680
<i>You're the anonymous sponsor.</i>

43:38.682 --> 43:39.947
Guilty as charged.

43:39.949 --> 43:42.084
Then I needed
to introduce the zombies

43:42.086 --> 43:44.186
in a way that would
put the audience on edge,

43:44.188 --> 43:47.222
but not convince you guys
of the coming threat.

43:47.224 --> 43:50.659
So you cut the tree down
to block our way here.

43:50.661 --> 43:53.028
And slash the tour van's tires.

43:53.030 --> 43:54.963
Uh, no, actually.

43:54.965 --> 43:56.098
I don't know what that was.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.399
Another mystery.

43:57.401 --> 44:00.837
Maybe, just maybe
an unsolved one.

44:00.839 --> 44:02.739
Uh, yeah, well...

44:02.741 --> 44:06.509
<i>The first time I had the zombies
attack, was at the spa.</i>

44:06.511 --> 44:08.243
<i>But I was hoping
to have a sequence</i>

44:08.245 --> 44:09.746
<i>of being chased by the zombies,</i>

44:09.748 --> 44:12.280
<i>maybe a grand finale
involving the hotel.</i>

44:12.282 --> 44:13.816
But no,

44:13.818 --> 44:16.285
you figured a way to trap my
zombies before I could finish.

44:16.287 --> 44:18.086
I would've
gotten away with it, too,

44:18.088 --> 44:19.856
if it wasn't
for you meddling kids

44:19.858 --> 44:22.958
and your incredible talent
for solving mysteries.

44:26.964 --> 44:29.432
Months of research
down the drain,

44:29.434 --> 44:32.568
I even found this weird little
pendant on the island

44:32.570 --> 44:33.636
I thought was a good omen

44:33.638 --> 44:35.104
that the movie
was going to happen.

44:35.106 --> 44:36.840
Simone's pendant?

44:36.842 --> 44:38.708
Fat lot of good that did me.

44:38.710 --> 44:40.343
Well, it wasn't very nice.

44:40.345 --> 44:42.011
You had us all pretty worried

44:42.013 --> 44:44.113
that something nefarious
was going on.

44:44.115 --> 44:46.015
Yeah, and come to find out

44:46.017 --> 44:48.453
the only thing nefarious
was you.

44:51.624 --> 44:54.190
I'm sorry. I truly am.

44:54.192 --> 44:57.093
I thought
with your amazing performances,

44:57.095 --> 44:59.128
your good looks...

44:59.130 --> 45:03.300
Well...
I suppose so.

45:03.302 --> 45:05.134
...and comedic timing...

45:05.136 --> 45:07.071
All right! High five.

45:09.175 --> 45:11.575
...it really was going
to be an amazing movie.

45:11.577 --> 45:15.112
But now, I'll never be
able to finish the film.

45:15.114 --> 45:17.716
Oh, no.

45:25.124 --> 45:26.490
Don't cry, Alan.

45:26.492 --> 45:28.158
I mean, what you did was wrong,

45:28.160 --> 45:30.196
but we can still
do the movie.

45:30.797 --> 45:32.129
We can?

45:32.131 --> 45:34.565
Of course, we can.
How hard can it be?

45:34.567 --> 45:37.167
Memorize a few lines here,
look scared there.

45:37.169 --> 45:39.102
- Uh, you mean it?
- Why not?

45:39.104 --> 45:41.473
We are supposed
to be having fun, after all.

45:41.475 --> 45:43.675
And that will give me time
to finally figure out

45:43.677 --> 45:46.143
the "white whale"
of <i>Unsolved Capers.</i>

45:46.145 --> 45:49.279
The mystery
of Zombie Island.

45:49.281 --> 45:51.048
Then, ladies and gentlemen,

45:51.050 --> 45:53.286
let's make a movie.

45:55.856 --> 45:57.691
Few tears gets them every time.

46:09.102 --> 46:10.768
Hollywood.

46:10.770 --> 46:13.638
In this scene, you discover
the treasure of Morgan Moonscar

46:13.640 --> 46:15.774
and must open it,
in order to return

46:15.776 --> 46:19.812
the evil zombie spirits
back from whence they came.

46:19.814 --> 46:21.513
That's not how the story goes.

46:21.515 --> 46:24.182
The zombies were just victims
of the cat-people.

46:24.184 --> 46:28.052
Hello? "Based" on a true story.

46:28.054 --> 46:30.723
Uh, is it just me,
or now that Velma

46:30.725 --> 46:34.058
can solve mysteries again she's,
sort of, looking for one everywhere?

46:34.060 --> 46:37.363
One time, I swore off gluten
for a year, and after that,

46:37.365 --> 46:41.300
I ate more gluten in a day
than I had my entire life!

46:41.302 --> 46:42.670
I think this is like that.

46:44.639 --> 46:45.606
What's "gluten"?

46:47.842 --> 46:49.275
Now, it's cold out.

46:49.277 --> 46:50.809
You're wet and shivering.

46:50.811 --> 46:54.549
But we're not... wet.

47:05.761 --> 47:06.627
Action!

47:24.379 --> 47:26.348
It's her! She's back!

47:31.520 --> 47:34.020
Oh, I've missed you so much!

47:34.022 --> 47:35.157
Mm.

47:36.391 --> 47:37.924
I can't believe it.

47:37.926 --> 47:41.094
I can't believe it's you,
where have you been?

47:41.096 --> 47:43.296
Freddie, are you okay?

47:43.298 --> 47:47.667
Uh, Fred, that's not
the real Mystery Machine.

47:47.669 --> 47:48.936
You don't know.

47:48.938 --> 47:52.305
Maybe she got stronger,
and broke out to find me!

47:52.307 --> 47:53.810
Afraid not, Fred.

48:00.650 --> 48:03.784
Fred, gang, meet Seaver.
He's our stuntman.

48:03.786 --> 48:04.885
Howdy.

48:04.887 --> 48:06.687
Seaver had this beautiful
piece of machinery

48:06.689 --> 48:08.422
built for the climax
of the film.

48:08.424 --> 48:11.425
We're gonna jump this thing
over the hotel

48:11.427 --> 48:13.796
while being chased
by a zombie hoard!

48:14.597 --> 48:16.162
Whoa!

48:17.734 --> 48:20.501
Yep! I've been driving it
back and forth over the island

48:20.503 --> 48:23.070
since we came in
on that ferry yesterday.

48:23.072 --> 48:24.338
The ferry?

48:24.340 --> 48:26.907
Ha! I thought
I was hallucinating!

48:26.909 --> 48:28.309
Why didn't you tell us?

48:28.311 --> 48:29.877
Because of the promise.

48:29.879 --> 48:32.279
I was so desperate
to solve a mystery,

48:32.281 --> 48:35.282
I started thinking
I was just making one up!

48:35.284 --> 48:37.251
I almost thought
I was going crazy!

48:37.253 --> 48:40.055
But now that I know
I'm not going crazy...

48:40.057 --> 48:41.288
can I drive it?

48:41.290 --> 48:42.858
No, you may not.

48:42.860 --> 48:47.863
It takes a trained professional
to drive this thing.

48:47.865 --> 48:52.534
But... you can ride shotgun while
I park it in the ferry overnight.

48:52.536 --> 48:54.136
Cool!

48:54.138 --> 48:57.171
I'll let you boys handle that
while we head to our next scene.

48:57.173 --> 48:58.507
What's our next scene?

48:58.509 --> 49:01.177
Oh, you'll see.

49:06.250 --> 49:07.685
And, action!

49:08.819 --> 49:10.986
I'm hungry.

49:10.988 --> 49:14.189
Nah, no, no, no. Scooby, no.
The line is "I'm scared."

49:14.191 --> 49:15.259
Try it again.

49:16.894 --> 49:19.162
I'm hungry.

49:19.164 --> 49:21.998
No, no, Scoobs.
It's "I'm scared."

49:22.000 --> 49:23.434
The line is "I'm scared."

49:26.971 --> 49:27.839
I'm...

49:29.107 --> 49:29.974
hungry.

49:32.476 --> 49:34.476
It's not "I'm hungry,"
It's "I'm sca..."

49:34.478 --> 49:36.746
What? Uh-huh.

49:36.748 --> 49:39.615
Okay, Scooby, you know what?
I just found out...

49:39.617 --> 49:40.817
there's no more food.

49:40.819 --> 49:44.754
I repeat,
there is no more food.

49:44.756 --> 49:45.822
I'm...

49:45.824 --> 49:46.825
scared!

49:47.859 --> 49:48.727
Perfect!

49:50.161 --> 49:53.162
All right, Seaver.
Just run straight through the glass.

49:53.164 --> 49:57.633
This action camera will capture
everything in perfect high definition.

49:57.635 --> 49:59.268
Fred, what do you think
you're doing?

49:59.270 --> 50:03.306
I appreciate Seaver and all,
but I don't need a stuntman.

50:03.308 --> 50:04.774
I can do my own stunts.

50:04.776 --> 50:06.977
I'm a man of action, after all.

50:06.979 --> 50:11.048
No, Fred, you're a man
with an ascot.

50:11.050 --> 50:12.850
There's a huge difference.

50:12.852 --> 50:16.754
Listen, I really appreciate your
commitment to the role, Fred.

50:16.756 --> 50:19.857
But, what would happen
if you got hurt, huh?

50:19.859 --> 50:21.125
You're one of the stars.

50:21.127 --> 50:24.595
If you couldn't continue,
the movie would be over.

50:24.597 --> 50:26.230
I guess you're right. I...

50:26.232 --> 50:28.165
I am pretty important.

50:28.167 --> 50:29.767
Of course I'm right.

50:29.769 --> 50:32.268
I'm Alan Smithee. Have you seen
how many movies I've done?

50:32.270 --> 50:33.937
- No.
- Well, it's a lot.

50:33.939 --> 50:36.974
There's a whole bunch of them.
You have to trust me, Fred.

50:36.976 --> 50:37.943
You ready, Seaver?

50:40.913 --> 50:42.980
And, action!

50:42.982 --> 50:44.450
- Oh!
- Fred, don't!

50:47.254 --> 50:48.186
Ugh!

50:50.022 --> 50:50.890
Ugh!

50:51.991 --> 50:53.891
Missed it. Oh.

50:53.893 --> 50:54.760
Medic!

50:57.563 --> 50:59.596
Boss, we have a problem.

50:59.598 --> 51:01.565
What kind of problem?

51:05.138 --> 51:06.570
Ahhh!

51:06.572 --> 51:09.375
Like, I think we had
a wardrobe malfunction.

51:10.844 --> 51:12.476
Wardrobe!

51:12.478 --> 51:15.814
We're going to need
bigger pants.

51:15.816 --> 51:18.049
In this scene,
the zombies have you cornered.

51:18.051 --> 51:21.318
All you need to do
is stand there and look scared.

51:21.320 --> 51:22.319
Let's practice.

51:22.321 --> 51:24.357
Okay. Look scared.

51:28.495 --> 51:30.361
Yeah, sure.
I'll fix it in post.

51:30.363 --> 51:31.930
Places, everyone!

51:40.308 --> 51:41.541
Action!

51:51.418 --> 51:52.485
Look out!

51:59.694 --> 52:00.560
Oh!

52:02.697 --> 52:04.532
Alan, are you all right?

52:07.367 --> 52:09.735
Uh, yeah. But, what happened?

52:09.737 --> 52:12.771
It looks like someone
deliberately cut the rope.

52:12.773 --> 52:13.639
But, why?

52:13.641 --> 52:15.007
And is that...

52:15.009 --> 52:16.243
cat hair?

52:16.245 --> 52:18.544
The palm tree.
Simone's pendant.

52:18.546 --> 52:21.480
This is it, Velma!
One of the unsolved capers!

52:21.482 --> 52:24.317
It's happening. I have to go!

52:24.319 --> 52:26.685
Fred, I don't think she's okay.

52:26.687 --> 52:28.654
We've got bigger problems,
Daphne.

52:28.656 --> 52:31.191
It looks like we have
another mystery on our hands!

52:31.193 --> 52:32.524
Uh, could you say that again?

52:32.526 --> 52:34.393
Maybe with a little more oomph?

52:34.395 --> 52:36.528
Um, sure.

52:36.530 --> 52:37.696
Well, gang...

52:37.698 --> 52:39.034
Hold on, hold on,
I'm not ready.

52:39.700 --> 52:40.767
Okay, I'm good.

52:40.769 --> 52:44.037
In three, two, one.

52:44.039 --> 52:48.409
Well, gang, it looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.

52:51.046 --> 52:53.914
Cut! That was great.
Really great.

52:53.916 --> 52:54.783
Next scene.

53:15.837 --> 53:16.670
Ugh!

53:16.672 --> 53:18.838
Velma, Velma! Are you okay?

53:18.840 --> 53:20.640
I'm better than okay.

53:20.642 --> 53:24.511
I'm finally going to get to the
bottom of the Zombie Island Mystery!

53:24.513 --> 53:25.880
But we already have!

53:25.882 --> 53:28.249
It was just a movie
Alan wanted us to be in.

53:28.251 --> 53:31.419
Keep up, Blake.
Not that Zombie Island.

53:31.421 --> 53:32.753
The other one.

53:32.755 --> 53:34.355
The one where
the cat-people appeared

53:34.357 --> 53:35.656
and tried to suck
our life-force!

53:35.658 --> 53:37.358
There is no way they were real!

53:37.360 --> 53:39.627
It defies the laws of science.

53:39.629 --> 53:42.430
But it was, Velma!
We were there!

53:42.432 --> 53:44.699
No. It's got to be
something else.

53:44.701 --> 53:46.033
Something rational.

53:46.035 --> 53:48.169
And now that they're back,
this is my chance

53:48.171 --> 53:52.707
to find out what is really going
on or my name isn't Velma Garbo.

53:52.709 --> 53:54.475
Your name is Velma Dinkley.

53:54.477 --> 53:57.145
Not since I became
a movie star.

53:57.147 --> 53:58.014
Velma!

53:59.249 --> 54:01.017
Wait, the cat people are back?

54:05.521 --> 54:07.555
I know you're out there.

54:07.557 --> 54:10.227
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty.

54:17.334 --> 54:19.500
Okay, this is the last shot
of the day.

54:19.502 --> 54:21.370
The magic hour!

54:21.372 --> 54:23.839
We'll start up the weather machine
and have the zombies attack.

54:23.841 --> 54:26.210
All you have to do
is run the other way, okay?

54:29.313 --> 54:31.213
Run, run!

54:31.215 --> 54:32.082
Run!

54:36.720 --> 54:37.788
Shaggy!

54:40.458 --> 54:44.128
It's just a cat, Scoob.
Nothing to be worried about.

54:48.999 --> 54:50.801
Like, nevermind!

54:58.243 --> 54:59.110
Whoa!

55:12.924 --> 55:14.757
I know I should
be freaking out,

55:14.759 --> 55:18.129
but this is adding some serious
production value to the picture!

55:21.566 --> 55:23.032
Ahhh!

55:30.775 --> 55:32.176
Stay back.

55:32.178 --> 55:33.643
Ugh, stay back!

55:33.645 --> 55:34.879
I'm allergic!

55:36.614 --> 55:38.815
Sorry, boss. We quit.

55:43.721 --> 55:46.323
What? Come back,
you can't just leave!

55:46.325 --> 55:49.328
What about the art?
What about sacrifice?

56:03.642 --> 56:05.211
We can't keep this up.

56:09.583 --> 56:11.382
Are those cats?

56:11.384 --> 56:13.451
No. Those are...

56:13.453 --> 56:14.985
cat-people!

56:14.987 --> 56:15.855
Uh-oh.

56:19.658 --> 56:21.060
We have to get out of here.

56:22.462 --> 56:24.661
No! We have to finish the film!

56:24.663 --> 56:26.064
The film?

56:26.066 --> 56:27.599
We're being attacked
by immortal cat-people

56:27.601 --> 56:29.167
and you're worried
about the film?

56:29.169 --> 56:32.205
Who cares? There's gotta
be a way off this island!

56:34.307 --> 56:35.739
The ferry.

56:35.741 --> 56:36.841
Yes.

56:36.843 --> 56:38.243
I'll meet you there.

56:38.245 --> 56:40.711
He's right.
The last ferry leaves at dusk.

56:40.713 --> 56:43.982
If we hurry, we can get on it,
and get off the island!

56:43.984 --> 56:45.083
Come on!

56:55.463 --> 56:56.394
Alan?

56:56.396 --> 56:58.631
Oh, no! What did you do?

57:02.336 --> 57:03.902
We can't leave.

57:03.904 --> 57:06.372
Not until we finish this movie.

57:06.374 --> 57:08.773
We have to finish!

57:11.945 --> 57:13.379
Alan's lost it.

57:13.381 --> 57:16.250
And we've lost our only way
off this island.

57:22.557 --> 57:23.721
No!

57:23.723 --> 57:25.291
I won't lose another one.
Not again.

57:25.293 --> 57:28.296
Not this time.
Not this time!

57:29.363 --> 57:30.765
Fred, don't!

57:33.901 --> 57:35.201
Well, I'll be!

57:35.203 --> 57:37.405
Maybe he'll be a stuntman yet!

57:40.308 --> 57:43.010
Don't worry, baby.
Freddie's here.

57:54.889 --> 57:56.223
I don't see him!

58:13.275 --> 58:15.609
Everyone, get in
the Mystery Machine.

58:15.611 --> 58:16.478
Hurry!

58:32.595 --> 58:34.294
Don't worry about me.

58:34.296 --> 58:37.864
Someone grab a camera
and film this!

58:42.538 --> 58:44.507
Freddie, do something!

58:57.520 --> 59:00.588
Why would the cat-people
need Simone's pendant?

59:00.590 --> 59:02.390
Why, indeed.

59:02.392 --> 59:03.393
Hmm.

59:06.663 --> 59:08.464
Like, they're gaining on us!

59:11.134 --> 59:13.167
Uh-oh, what was that?

59:13.169 --> 59:15.539
Bad luck. Real bad luck!

59:17.240 --> 59:18.107
Ahhh!

59:24.847 --> 59:26.315
Look out!

59:26.317 --> 59:27.183
Thanks.

59:28.117 --> 59:30.186
Fred, "U" turn. Now!

59:51.241 --> 59:52.109
Ugh!

59:57.414 --> 59:58.282
Ugh!

01:00:03.354 --> 01:00:04.221
Ahhh!

01:00:27.545 --> 01:00:28.678
What now?

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.914
There's only one way
out of this, Fred.

01:00:32.183 --> 01:00:33.649
Do you think I can?

01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:35.387
I know you can.

01:00:46.264 --> 01:00:48.866
Freddie, what are you doing?

01:00:48.868 --> 01:00:50.368
Hold on, gang.

01:00:51.771 --> 01:00:53.972
Oh, I need an exterior shot.

01:01:01.913 --> 01:01:03.045
- Whoa!
- Yikes!

01:01:03.047 --> 01:01:04.115
Ahhh!

01:01:34.648 --> 01:01:36.180
Yes!

01:01:36.182 --> 01:01:39.051
That was amazing!
Let's do it again.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.285
Way to go, Fred!

01:01:41.287 --> 01:01:43.588
You were both fast and furious,

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.557
and thanks to my
high-flying drone,

01:01:45.559 --> 01:01:47.958
we got the whole thing
for the movie!

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.529
I think there are bigger things
to worry about than the movie.

01:01:51.531 --> 01:01:52.399
Look!

01:01:53.533 --> 01:01:55.966
Hurry, everyone!
Head for the hotel!

01:04:16.279 --> 01:04:20.648
Welcome to Moonstar Island Resort's
finest dining establishment.

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:22.917
For the discerning
immortal Cat Person,

01:04:22.919 --> 01:04:27.388
we have the finest fish caught
within the surrounding swamps.

01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:29.158
Please take a seat.

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:36.430
A wonderful
treat for you to eat.

01:04:36.432 --> 01:04:38.699
Bon appetit.

01:04:38.701 --> 01:04:40.303
It rhymes.

01:04:40.838 --> 01:04:42.403
Blech!

01:04:44.875 --> 01:04:47.543
Like, what kind of cat
doesn't like fish?

01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:07.865
Looks like they're on a roll.

01:05:12.236 --> 01:05:14.137
Where did you come from?

01:05:17.241 --> 01:05:18.475
Come on, guys.

01:05:22.413 --> 01:05:25.081
What do we do now?
They'll be after us in no time.

01:05:25.083 --> 01:05:26.951
We need a good place to hide.

01:05:28.585 --> 01:05:30.585
Why is everyone looking at us?

01:05:30.587 --> 01:05:31.788
How rude.

01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:34.757
Because, you two
are the best hiders we know.

01:05:34.759 --> 01:05:36.993
Good point.

01:05:36.995 --> 01:05:38.797
I think we know just the place.

01:05:42.834 --> 01:05:44.434
Everyone in, quick!

01:05:44.436 --> 01:05:48.004
Are we sure about this?

01:05:48.006 --> 01:05:49.307
Sure enough.

01:06:05.724 --> 01:06:06.856
Where are we?

01:06:06.858 --> 01:06:08.357
I remember this.

01:06:08.359 --> 01:06:10.693
This is where the Cat People
tried to siphon our life force,

01:06:10.695 --> 01:06:12.395
the last time we were here.

01:06:12.397 --> 01:06:15.398
But, we stopped them, remember?
Maybe these are...

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.867
relatives?

01:06:16.869 --> 01:06:18.736
Maybe, maybe not.

01:06:18.738 --> 01:06:21.504
Nothing ever felt right
about our previous adventure

01:06:21.506 --> 01:06:23.707
but I could never
figure out why.

01:06:23.709 --> 01:06:26.277
Hey, Scoobs. Move around
here, get some footage.

01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:34.918
You okay, Scoob?

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.285
Yeah.

01:06:36.287 --> 01:06:39.423
Now, why is there a hole in
the middle of this cave?

01:06:39.425 --> 01:06:41.158
Why are there holes everywhere?

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.661
It looks like someone's
been digging for something.

01:06:44.663 --> 01:06:47.531
Maybe the Cat People
needed a litter box.

01:06:47.533 --> 01:06:50.467
They must be looking for
Moonscar's lost treasure.

01:06:50.469 --> 01:06:54.271
But, why would mystical immortal
creatures need a treasure?

01:06:54.273 --> 01:06:56.207
My question, exactly.

01:06:56.209 --> 01:06:57.407
Look at this.

01:06:57.409 --> 01:06:59.144
It's the moondial.

01:06:59.146 --> 01:07:02.312
The Cat People were waiting
for the harvest moon to rise

01:07:02.314 --> 01:07:04.314
in order to steal
our life force.

01:07:04.316 --> 01:07:06.050
That's weird.

01:07:06.052 --> 01:07:09.053
The cat symbol on the moondial
looks just like Alan's pendant.

01:07:09.055 --> 01:07:12.422
That's all well and good
but if the Cat People are real,

01:07:12.424 --> 01:07:14.826
then the rest of
the legend is true too.

01:07:14.828 --> 01:07:16.961
If we don't
get out of here, we're dead,

01:07:16.963 --> 01:07:20.634
or at least undead which
also sounds pretty bad.

01:07:25.172 --> 01:07:27.305
Hmm.

01:07:27.307 --> 01:07:31.676
I think I figured out what's going on
with the Cat People and more importantly,

01:07:31.678 --> 01:07:33.778
I think I know
how to stop them.

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.581
But it's too late,
the harvest moon has risen.

01:07:36.583 --> 01:07:39.384
That means we're all
going to turn into zombies.

01:07:39.386 --> 01:07:41.319
This once,
I think you're right.

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:50.859
Brain.

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:13.881
I need brain.

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:19.421
No, stay back.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.591
Stop. We didn't know
the curse was real.

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:26.728
It wasn't even my idea.

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:32.465
As I suspected.

01:09:32.466 --> 01:09:35.970
The greeters and the ferry captain from
when we first arrived on the island.

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:38.673
What? You're
not zombies at all.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.644
And, you aren't
soul sucking Cat People.

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:48.115
Bravo! Bravo!

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:51.051
I really couldn't
ask for a better performance.

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:53.154
That was amazing.

01:09:53.156 --> 01:09:55.390
I didn't
know you had it in you.

01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:56.524
But how?

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.160
Well, it was easy, really.

01:09:58.162 --> 01:10:00.528
After we found out
they were making the movie,

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:04.732
I figured whoever was trying to sabotage
the film must be doing it for a reason.

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:09.603
When we saw the holes in the cavern
and the pedestal, it all made sense.

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:13.241
Someone from the island must be
looking for Moonscar's treasure.

01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:16.211
And who were the only people
that were on the island

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:18.013
but not part of the movie?

01:10:18.015 --> 01:10:19.414
These three.

01:10:19.416 --> 01:10:21.683
But, how did you know they'd be
frightened by the zombies?

01:10:21.685 --> 01:10:25.887
Well, if they were so convinced
that Moonscar's treasure existed,

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:27.456
which of course it doesn't,

01:10:27.458 --> 01:10:30.625
they must on some level
believe in the curse.

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:33.929
So, we left a pendant to draw
them further into the crypt.

01:10:33.931 --> 01:10:37.032
And dressed as zombies
to scare them into my trap.

01:10:37.034 --> 01:10:39.534
Which totally
worked by the way.

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:41.005
But, the gold?

01:10:42.172 --> 01:10:45.141
Good old gold foil
wrapped Scooby Snacks

Alan Smithee productions.

01:10:50.315 --> 01:10:53.249
There are still a
few things I don't understand.

01:10:53.251 --> 01:10:54.616
Just a few?

01:10:54.618 --> 01:10:57.552
Yeah, like how
did they control the cats?

01:10:57.554 --> 01:11:02.825
With this. The four of them used a cat whistle
to guide them into doing their bidding.

01:11:02.827 --> 01:11:05.461
Four? There's only three of us.

01:11:05.463 --> 01:11:07.697
Like, no way!

01:11:07.699 --> 01:11:11.200
There's the scary black cat, the one that
punctured the roof of the Mystery Machine.

01:11:11.202 --> 01:11:13.671
That attacked
us in the hallway.

01:11:15.273 --> 01:11:18.209
Scooby, tight close-up.
This big, right here.

01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:23.312
Maybe, just maybe,

01:11:23.314 --> 01:11:26.483
<i>there really is an immortal
Cat Person left on the island.</i>

01:11:26.485 --> 01:11:29.886
Maybe you didn't stop them all
the last time you were here.

01:11:29.888 --> 01:11:32.822
<i>Maybe, they still exist.</i>

01:11:32.824 --> 01:11:36.826
Roaming the island
for their next victim.

01:11:39.964 --> 01:11:41.999
Save that tape. That was money.

01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:43.900
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:43.902 --> 01:11:45.936
I know what you're thinking.

01:11:45.938 --> 01:11:49.707
I'm not saying that because based on
a true story will sell more tickets.

01:11:51.177 --> 01:11:53.277
Yeah, you're right.
That's exactly what I'm saying

01:11:53.279 --> 01:11:55.611
and it's gonna
go right under the title.

01:12:00.753 --> 01:12:04.290
And, here are your
escorts right on time.

01:12:06.826 --> 01:12:10.060
We would have gotten away with
it too, if it wasn't for you...

01:12:10.062 --> 01:12:13.398
- you...
- Meddling whippersnappers.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:18.303
And don't forget talented film
director, Alan Smithee.

01:12:18.305 --> 01:12:19.803
We haven't forgotten.

01:12:19.805 --> 01:12:21.872
You'll get yours, Smithee.

01:12:21.874 --> 01:12:24.875
I'm sure I will.
But not before you.

01:12:24.877 --> 01:12:28.912
Have fun serving
15 to eternity in prison, lady.

01:12:28.914 --> 01:12:32.517
Ugh, and I got so
close to finishing this film.

01:12:32.519 --> 01:12:35.086
All I needed was
a boffo finale.

01:12:35.088 --> 01:12:37.422
At least,
you gave it a try, Alan.

01:12:38.592 --> 01:12:41.261
Tickles!

01:12:50.704 --> 01:12:54.072
Would you look at that?
I wonder what they are doing.

01:12:54.074 --> 01:12:59.110
The legend stated that the cats were
the guardians of Moonscar's treasure.

01:12:59.112 --> 01:13:01.047
Maybe...

01:13:01.516 --> 01:13:02.883
Oh!

01:13:09.257 --> 01:13:10.690
Could it be?

01:13:11.526 --> 01:13:12.690
Oh, boy!

01:13:12.692 --> 01:13:14.493
It's gold!

01:13:14.495 --> 01:13:16.728
I can't believe it.

01:13:19.634 --> 01:13:21.100
I'm rich!

01:13:21.102 --> 01:13:23.469
Like, really, really rich.

01:13:23.471 --> 01:13:28.073
With all that gold,
you can make a sequel or maybe a trilogy.

01:13:28.075 --> 01:13:31.377
Yeah, a trilogy.

01:13:31.379 --> 01:13:35.416
Are you kidding me? After this flick,
I'm done with the movie business.

01:13:37.084 --> 01:13:40.085
But I thought
directing was your dream?

01:13:40.087 --> 01:13:42.188
I've got a new dream.

01:13:42.190 --> 01:13:46.892
One involving retirement on a tropical
island where no one gives you notes,

01:13:46.894 --> 01:13:51.331
and bets your future
on a weekend box office.

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:54.534
It's been a pleasure working with you
kids, it really has,

01:13:54.536 --> 01:13:56.238
but I'm retired.

01:13:58.806 --> 01:14:01.141
What a vacation, huh, gang?

01:14:01.143 --> 01:14:03.412
Maybe the best vacation ever.

01:14:04.379 --> 01:14:05.744
How so, Velma?

01:14:05.746 --> 01:14:09.182
I finally get to cross off one
of my unsolved capers.

01:14:09.184 --> 01:14:11.952
Unsolved? But, the Cat People
from last time...

01:14:11.954 --> 01:14:14.888
...must be the same people looking
for the treasure this time.

01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:16.923
And the original zombies?

01:14:16.925 --> 01:14:19.459
Swamp gas.

01:14:19.461 --> 01:14:22.829
I think it's best
to let her have this one, Fred.

01:14:22.831 --> 01:14:25.165
Point is,
we can't stop solving crimes

01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:28.001
because we might get hurt
or step on some toes.

01:14:28.003 --> 01:14:29.970
It is in our blood.

01:14:29.972 --> 01:14:32.839
It is our destiny.

01:14:32.841 --> 01:14:34.741
You know, Velma's right.

01:14:34.743 --> 01:14:37.877
We should never have made you guys
promise to not be who you are.

01:14:37.879 --> 01:14:39.614
Yeah.

01:14:39.616 --> 01:14:42.148
Besides, without burning off
calories running from monsters,

01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:44.418
I think I gained a whole pound.

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:47.255
Who knew being afraid
was such good exercise.

01:14:47.257 --> 01:14:50.059
So what do you say, gang?
Mystery Inc. forever?

01:14:53.196 --> 01:14:54.528
Freddie?

01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:57.498
Of course, I'm in.
But if we're gonna do this,

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:00.067
we're gonna need
the real Mystery Machine.

01:15:00.069 --> 01:15:03.504
Ah! I should have never sold
it in the first place.

01:15:03.506 --> 01:15:06.274
And we'll do whatever
we can to get it back.

01:15:06.276 --> 01:15:07.410
Mm-hmm.

01:15:08.444 --> 01:15:09.445
Then...

01:15:12.081 --> 01:15:14.616
Mystery Inc. forever!

01:15:15.952 --> 01:15:18.587
Oh, I can't believe it!

01:15:18.589 --> 01:15:20.888
Sheriff,
what are you doing here?

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:23.924
When I heard about some teenagers
and a dog getting into a mess

01:15:23.926 --> 01:15:25.360
with some crooks
dressed up as cats,

01:15:25.362 --> 01:15:27.828
I thought I'd come
take a look-see.

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:29.298
Turns out, I was right.

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.832
You kids are solving
mysteries again, aren't you?

01:15:31.834 --> 01:15:34.835
I thought we'd agreed you
weren't gonna do that anymore.

01:15:34.837 --> 01:15:37.773
But, Sheriff...

01:15:37.775 --> 01:15:39.907
We just have to
solve mysteries.

01:15:39.909 --> 01:15:41.743
It's the only thing
we're good at.

01:15:43.647 --> 01:15:47.883
Why won't you let us be who we were
meant to be?

01:15:47.885 --> 01:15:50.185
You know, you don't
need to cry, Daphne.

01:15:50.187 --> 01:15:52.487
I'm sure you can
do something else.

01:15:52.489 --> 01:15:55.891
But there is nothing else.

01:15:55.893 --> 01:15:58.293
It's our life's work.

01:16:02.734 --> 01:16:05.300
Uh...

01:16:05.302 --> 01:16:07.402
Well I guess if you have to.

01:16:07.404 --> 01:16:08.538
Thanks, Sheriff.

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:11.973
And a few tears
gets 'em every time.

01:16:11.975 --> 01:16:15.143
Well, since I can't
talk you out of it,

01:16:15.145 --> 01:16:18.281
all I can do is
tell you to be careful.

01:16:18.283 --> 01:16:20.115
There are a lot
of people out there

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:22.318
that won't take too kindly to
you meddling in their business.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.520
Understood. Thanks, Sheriff.

01:16:24.522 --> 01:16:26.955
All right, then. Why don't
I give you a lift home?

01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:28.391
Maybe in a little bit.

01:16:28.393 --> 01:16:31.363
Like, being a zombie
works up an appetite.

01:16:32.097 --> 01:16:33.898
It sure does.

01:16:39.003 --> 01:16:41.938
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:04.294
Hello, my little freaks.

01:17:04.296 --> 01:17:06.296
Welcome back to the show.

01:17:06.298 --> 01:17:10.367
Next up, we have a zombie flick
that's sure to make you meow for more.

01:17:10.369 --> 01:17:13.203
Hold onto your
tails as we watch,

01:17:13.205 --> 01:17:17.708
<i>"Zombie Teenagers and
The Island of Doom."</i>

01:17:17.710 --> 01:17:21.680
Ugh, seriously?
I mean, that's the title?

01:17:23.315 --> 01:17:25.349
Right.

01:17:25.351 --> 01:17:29.286
<i>On an island
surrounded by water...</i>

01:17:29.288 --> 01:17:31.856
<i>A group of gullible teenagers</i>

01:17:31.858 --> 01:17:34.091
<i>will face a terror</i>

01:17:34.093 --> 01:17:37.562
<i>that isn't human.</i>

01:17:37.564 --> 01:17:39.265
And... action!

01:17:40.132 --> 01:17:42.834
- I'm hungry.
- Cut!

01:17:42.836 --> 01:17:44.034
I'm hungry.

01:17:44.036 --> 01:17:45.403
Hungry.

01:17:45.405 --> 01:17:46.972
Hungry.

01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:51.810
Hungry.

01:17:51.812 --> 01:17:52.976
Hungry.

01:17:52.978 --> 01:17:54.779
Hungry.

01:17:54.781 --> 01:17:56.616
I'm...

01:17:58.885 --> 01:18:00.785
hungry.

01:18:00.787 --> 01:18:02.255
Cut!

01:18:02.923 --> 01:18:05.390
Action!

01:18:05.392 --> 01:18:09.160
Cut!
Ugh, Fred, not again.

01:18:09.162 --> 01:18:11.162
- Action!
- Like, listen.

01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:13.398
I know there's mysterious stuff
around every...

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.136
Cut, cut!
You ruined everything. Everything!

01:18:23.443 --> 01:18:26.745
Zoinks!

01:18:26.747 --> 01:18:27.780
Uh-oh.
