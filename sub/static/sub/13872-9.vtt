00:07.140 --> 00:10.632
Gentlemen, who stole my "hairarium"?

00:11.344 --> 00:13.505
- Your what?
- My hair helmet!

00:14.781 --> 00:17.306
That's right there. On your head.

00:19.552 --> 00:20.541
Bull...

01:03.496 --> 01:06.897
There's only one way
to get across this street:

01:06.966 --> 01:08.456
You close your eyes...

01:08.535 --> 01:11.595
and just bolt out there
with complete disregard for machines.

01:11.671 --> 01:15.835
What if I just kept one open
and maybe tried it that way?

01:15.909 --> 01:19.037
Yeah, if you think you're gonna
get somewhere in life by cheating.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.808
I mean, you may as well
just paint yourself yellow...

01:21.881 --> 01:24.543
run around like a maniac,
and call yourself Banana Man...

01:24.617 --> 01:26.414
'cause that's what you're doing.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.920
- What's that mean?
- Shut up. I'm trying to teach you.

01:28.988 --> 01:31.115
- Get out there, Banana Man!
- Okey-dokey.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.022
But wait a minute! Let's wait.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.755
- Hold on a minute. Stop.
- I did it. Look, I did it!

01:35.829 --> 01:39.765
- I'm across the street.
- Okay. Yes, you did... get lucky.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.858
Now, what did we learn today?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.926
Pedestrian always has the right of way.

01:44.003 --> 01:45.732
Yes. Except?

01:45.972 --> 01:49.135
- When you in the way?
- Exactly, my boy.

01:49.209 --> 01:52.838
Okay. This time we're gonna
cross the street the hard way.

01:52.912 --> 01:54.106
- The hard way?
- Longways.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.545
I'll keep score.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.877
What are you all doing?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.748
- Great. Geek patrol on alert.
- Send the nerd alarm.

01:59.819 --> 02:01.286
Look, we're not doing jack...

02:01.354 --> 02:04.619
so why don't you just go back inside
and stroke your test tubes...

02:04.691 --> 02:07.285
- like I know you love to do?
- Yeah. Go back inside.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.520
- We don't want any...
- Geek.

02:08.595 --> 02:11.359
Meatwad, come on in out of the road.
It's dangerous.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.423
This here's my road when I'm in it.
And I'm in it.

02:14.501 --> 02:17.129
- Who told you that?
- Master Shake.

02:17.604 --> 02:20.630
- Captain Master Shake.
- Of?

02:20.707 --> 02:24.268
Interplanetary Traffic Safety Squad
and Patrol.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.268
- Which unit?
- All units.

02:26.346 --> 02:27.472
Except?

02:27.547 --> 02:31.415
Except Jupiter and Spain,
unless otherwise noted.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.145
Good. We're learning something here.

02:33.219 --> 02:36.086
Meatwad, come here.
Traffic safety class is over. Forever.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.181
You leave now
and you're gonna get an "F."

02:38.258 --> 02:39.520
- Come on, Meatwad.
- He's right.

02:39.592 --> 02:43.153
If I don't pass this class,
I'm never gonna get a job crossing roads.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.390
But you're about to get a glass
of chocolate milk.

02:46.132 --> 02:48.464
- All right! Let's get the hell out of here.
- No!

02:48.535 --> 02:50.867
Grab my fry and look both ways for cars.

02:50.937 --> 02:53.804
Technically that's not
how the pros do it, but...

02:54.774 --> 02:56.605
<i>Don't drink the chocolate milk!</i>

02:56.676 --> 02:58.644
Do not drink the chocolate milk!

02:58.711 --> 03:01.043
- Damn, Meatwad. Your grip.
- I know. Come on.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.775
Let's go get me that chocolate milk.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.147
But you just said not
to drink the chocolate milk.

03:05.218 --> 03:08.312
I did? Hell, don't listen to me. Come on.

03:09.155 --> 03:10.850
<i>Don't drink the chocolate milk.</i>

03:10.924 --> 03:13.188
- Don't drink the chocolate milk.
- Okay, fine.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.955
- We won't drink any chocolate milk.
- What? How come?

03:16.029 --> 03:19.226
Look, just go into the kitchen,
and don't touch me.

03:19.999 --> 03:22.433
Don't you be giving it to me
in that sippy cup.

03:22.502 --> 03:25.369
I'm an adult and I deserve an adult glass.

03:28.641 --> 03:29.972
I don't think so.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.877
This milk is expired, Meatwad.

03:32.946 --> 03:36.507
I like it when it's chunky.
It's spreadable and it's edible.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.181
How could he have known
this milk was spoiled?

03:39.252 --> 03:40.742
It's been in there 18 months.

03:40.820 --> 03:44.153
- But he knew!
- Fellas, it doesn't matter.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.624
The point is I still am gonna eat it.

03:46.693 --> 03:51.027
You're not going to get it, Meatwad,
because this is going right in the garbage.

03:51.197 --> 03:54.166
<i>Don't open the trash.
Do not open the trash.</i>

03:54.234 --> 03:57.032
- Don't open the trash!
- What's in the trash?

03:57.103 --> 04:00.334
- Soon you will know.
- I guess we'll just have to find out.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.174
It's stinky, isn't it?
I knew it was gonna be stinky.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.007
He has the gift. He can see the future.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.013
Sometimes trash does stink, okay, Shake?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.446
But he predicted it.

04:09.515 --> 04:11.881
Surely you're not implying
that was coincidence.

04:11.951 --> 04:16.445
<i>No. It was The Prophecy,
starring Christopher Walken.</i>

04:16.522 --> 04:18.512
- He wasn't in that at all.
- He was.

04:18.591 --> 04:22.288
Look, you must tell me,
when am I getting some?

04:22.729 --> 04:25.323
But, you know, don't actually touch me.
You got germs.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.925
- Just grab on to this thing.
- Okay.

04:31.671 --> 04:32.933
French maid?

04:33.840 --> 04:35.239
You didn't expect me home...

04:35.308 --> 04:38.334
from the whipped-cream store
so soon, did you?

04:38.411 --> 04:40.174
And who's your lady friend?

04:40.380 --> 04:42.644
Wait! Don't open.
There's someone in here.

04:42.715 --> 04:44.307
I'm wrapping presents.

04:45.151 --> 04:47.551
What did she say? What was I doing?
Was she hot?

04:47.620 --> 04:49.144
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

04:49.222 --> 04:52.055
- Because you don't know, do you?
- I know. And it's sexy.

04:52.125 --> 04:56.994
I'll buy that, so long as everybody else
finally knows I got it going on.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.891
So I gotta go in your room now.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.423
I'm gonna be in there a long time,
and I'm not to be disturbed.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.036
- Watch this here.
- French maid?

05:05.104 --> 05:07.504
Wait! Don't open.
There's someone in here.

05:07.573 --> 05:08.938
I'm wrapping presents.

05:09.008 --> 05:12.000
I know what you're doing in there,
and I'm telling Frylock.

05:12.078 --> 05:15.775
He knows! He has the gift,
but he's about to lie to you.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.112
Please. We all know
what you do in there, Shake.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.913
You do it about five to six times a day.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.250
And what exactly is it that you think I do?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.655
<i>- I think you read Butt Frenzy.
- No, I don't.</i>

05:26.025 --> 05:28.550
But how did you know? You have the gift!

05:28.628 --> 05:31.062
I'm surrounded by shiners. Come on.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.155
- Where are we going?
- To exploit him.

05:33.966 --> 05:37.060
I need the numbers
for the Jersey Midnight Fantasy Pick 7...

05:37.136 --> 05:38.296
so latch on.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.563
- Don't hit me with that.
- I'll whale on you all I like.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.541
- Stop it. No.
- How's it taste?

05:44.277 --> 05:47.769
Okay. That was more of the future
of the back scratcher...

05:47.847 --> 05:49.781
- and not really you...
- Really?

05:49.849 --> 05:53.546
So let's just take this
and break it into a bunch of pieces...

05:53.619 --> 05:56.349
- Are you sure?
- ... and let me touch your hand.

05:56.422 --> 05:58.652
- I don't know.
- I'll be as gentle as a lamb...

05:58.725 --> 06:01.558
- Fine, but I'm against it.
- ... that works out with weights.

06:02.328 --> 06:05.320
<i>- One, two...
- My fingers, damn it.</i>

06:06.499 --> 06:09.798
<i>- ... three, four...
- Come on, this hurts!</i>

06:11.604 --> 06:13.367
- K-five?
- Yes. K-five.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.672
<i>- How you doing?
- Who are you talking to?</i>

06:18.745 --> 06:21.009
Come on. I just need one more.
Will you just...

06:21.080 --> 06:23.480
- The last one's seven.
- All right.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.040
That's what I was gonna put
before I talked to you.

06:26.119 --> 06:29.020
Just so we're clear here
on the distribution of funds.

06:29.088 --> 06:30.248
That's interesting.

06:30.323 --> 06:33.588
<i>Those are the same exact numbers
in your Learn to Count numbers book.</i>

06:33.659 --> 06:35.684
You're right. That is very interesting.

06:35.762 --> 06:39.163
You saying he's not right?
How do you explain the trash stinking?

06:39.232 --> 06:43.635
- I guess I can't.
- Need I remind you of the milk incident?

06:43.703 --> 06:47.799
The numbers are not one,
two, three, four, five, six, and seven.

06:47.874 --> 06:51.139
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven,
in order...</i>

06:51.210 --> 06:53.701
For frig! Damn it!

06:53.946 --> 06:55.573
What are the chances, Donna?

06:55.648 --> 06:58.048
Donna, how about shooting me
in the head?

06:58.117 --> 07:00.244
- It could've been a coincidence.
- Where is he?

07:00.319 --> 07:04.380
Because I predict his brain is about
to be yanked out right now.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.924
You picked the different numbers.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.324
Because you said that he would...
With the...

07:08.394 --> 07:11.761
- You're the brains that's coming out.
- Behold, it is I.

07:11.998 --> 07:15.126
I bestow upon you my dirty diapey.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.432
But there is another.

07:17.503 --> 07:20.529
Who among you
shall embark upon such a quest?

07:21.140 --> 07:23.836
To peel it off the ceiling.
It's stuck up there.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.571
Shut up. You're not Yoda.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.840
Yes, I foresaw that you would say that.

07:27.914 --> 07:31.782
But give forth to me your fry, Red One,
and secrets told shall be.

07:31.884 --> 07:34.751
You think you can see the future, huh?
Let's dance.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.591
Do not leave the house!

07:43.262 --> 07:46.231
You heard the man. Where are you going?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.995
I'm leaving the house,
because nothing's gonna happen to me.

07:49.068 --> 07:51.832
So are we. And guess what? He knew.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.838
Yep. I'm pretty amazing.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.567
The dog blew up again.

07:58.511 --> 07:59.671
Carlac, what's up?

07:59.745 --> 08:02.407
I thought we decided not to call me that.

08:02.482 --> 08:06.248
I wouldn't normally to your face,
but I'm feeling lucky.

08:06.319 --> 08:10.119
How much is in your wallet? What would
you say if I told you I could triple it?

08:10.189 --> 08:12.054
I would say I've heard this before.

08:12.124 --> 08:14.115
- The oil stain?
- Yeah. The oil stain.

08:14.193 --> 08:16.957
Tell me that does not totally look
like Jesus.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.930
People would have paid to see it
if this were the South, Carl.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.433
The sign and the poles cost money, Shake.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.198
And I still got about 1,000 of these
in my living room.

08:25.271 --> 08:28.570
We're hoping they ascend into heaven,
'cause no one's buying them.

08:28.641 --> 08:31.201
- How about in planes?
- They don't fit planes neither!

08:31.277 --> 08:33.506
They should. We designed them.

08:33.645 --> 08:36.945
Man, you are getting me so angry.

08:37.049 --> 08:40.506
Let's forget that, okay?
I've got something.

08:40.620 --> 08:44.784
There's science behind this,
and legend, and...

08:45.925 --> 08:46.949
Get over.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.560
Show him the damn future. Hurry up.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.790
Prepare to see what cannot be seen.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.425
Hang on. Shoot.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.969
What's the problem?
Do we have a problem?

08:58.037 --> 09:00.369
- Let me see your other hand.
- No.

09:00.439 --> 09:01.929
- What's happening?
- What the hell?

09:02.008 --> 09:03.703
- What's it doing?
- It's pissing me off.

09:03.776 --> 09:06.244
- No, it's about to. Just chill out.
- Kick it in.

09:06.312 --> 09:09.748
- I'm not gonna pay you to do that.
- Just give us a minute, Carl.

09:09.815 --> 09:11.339
- Will you hit it?
- It's coming.

09:11.417 --> 09:14.818
- Get a little professionalism, please.
- Try the middle finger.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.948
- Shoot.
- I've asked you nicely.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.786
This is going in your file.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.017
Don't make me go
to the higher-ups about this.

09:21.093 --> 09:23.857
Here it comes.
"The Giants are number one.

09:23.930 --> 09:27.593
"The Giants are number one,"
is the future. Your future.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.261
That's not a prediction. That's a fact of life.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.237
- Tell me something I don't know.
- Better do it, and quick.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.742
I didn't say jack to him
about having oil on his property.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.401
Are you prepared to tell him that?

09:38.477 --> 09:41.708
It's too late for concern. Where were you
when he was putting it up?

09:41.781 --> 09:43.043
You're the one that told him.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.709
Because you were the one
who was about to blow it!

09:45.785 --> 09:49.277
You said there's plenty of oil in Dallas,
they shouldn't have it all.

09:49.355 --> 09:52.415
<i>By the way, Dallas, that's on TV.</i>

09:52.491 --> 09:55.654
- So, Meatwad predicted oil?
- We're not telling you.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.697
You're toast, baby.
I'm talking to a dead man here.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.356
- Don't leave the house.
- Get off me.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.627
Do not leave the house.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.397
In that case,
I'll stay out here as long as I please.

10:04.470 --> 10:05.528
That's fine.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.866
This here's a good bed.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.942
- And this here is a good cheese.
- What are you doing?

10:13.012 --> 10:16.607
- Predicting the future.
- No. You're messing up my bedspread.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.980
I know. Look, I mean...

10:19.051 --> 10:21.884
Don't look in the room.
Do not look in the room!

10:21.954 --> 10:23.649
- See you.
- No, you don't.

10:23.756 --> 10:26.088
What the...
You've been eating all my caulk!

10:26.158 --> 10:28.319
Caulk? No. This is cheese.

10:28.394 --> 10:31.386
No. It's highly toxic industrial adhesive...

10:31.464 --> 10:34.160
used to connect electronic circuitry
to steel.

10:34.233 --> 10:36.167
- It's caulk.
- And it's good, too.
