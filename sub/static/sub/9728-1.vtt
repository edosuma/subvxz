02:06.710 --> 02:09.043
It's like selling ice to the Eskimos.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.787
I can't believe we pulled it off.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.255
They need those coprocessors.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.590
Hell, if they knew how to make 'em

02:14.593 --> 02:15.800
they wouldn't have to buy 'em.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.885
Next year, they will know how.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.050
By next year, I might
have something better.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.673
What?

02:21.683 --> 02:22.890
An idea, maybe.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.524
Guys, I'm
gonna run up to the room

02:31.526 --> 02:34.064
grab the number of this
hot young apprentice geisha

02:34.071 --> 02:35.937
have her call a couple of friends,

02:35.947 --> 02:37.438
and we will have a celebration.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.908
Listen, John, you
go for a celebration party.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.118
Go and have fun.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.453
I got a little work to do in the morning.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.039
I'm gonna have a drink
at the bar and go to bed.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.161
See you in the morning.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.288

04:12.377 --> 04:13.913
Yeah.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.754
I know it doesn't sound very interesting.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.293
You like computer chips?

04:20.177 --> 04:21.759
I make a pretty good living.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.462
What do you do?

04:28.810 --> 04:30.346
I drink sake.

04:32.856 --> 04:33.856
I can see that.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.101
Should you drink any more?

04:41.907 --> 04:42.907
No.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.985
Listen, it's pretty early.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.532
Maybe

04:49.539 --> 04:53.328
we could go out for dinner,
or see some Kabuki or

04:54.377 --> 04:55.377
go for,

04:58.590 --> 05:00.627
Bunduraku, which is my personal favorite.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.468
Or, there's a great

05:06.973 --> 05:09.681
Tiko concert in the gardens.

05:09.684 --> 05:10.515
Tiko?

05:10.519 --> 05:12.476
Tiko, you know, drums.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.640
Taiko.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.116
Can I try?

08:15.870 --> 08:16.870
Thanks.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.329
I guess it's good night.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.881
I, I had a great time.

08:39.852 --> 08:40.852
Very special.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.148
Thank you.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.941
Maybe, I'll see you again.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.192
I'll see you tomorrow for coffee, and

08:53.491 --> 08:55.448
at the coffee shop.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.489
Okay, listen, I'm not very good at this.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.326
I'm,

08:58.329 --> 08:59.410
okay, goodbye.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.124
Coat.

09:02.834 --> 09:03.834
What?

09:04.711 --> 09:06.168
Oh.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.171
My coat.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.588
Thanks.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.641
Don't go.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.511
But I thought you said...

09:24.606 --> 09:27.474
Don't go if you don't want to go.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.525
I don't want to go.

09:47.962 --> 09:48.962
Nice room.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.795
How long are you staying?

09:53.802 --> 09:55.384
Just tonight.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.217
Oh, really?

09:56.221 --> 10:00.386
Are you visiting Nagoya for
business or your family?

10:00.391 --> 10:02.178
Not visiting.

10:02.185 --> 10:06.304
Then, what are you doing here?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.231
I'm sorry, I don't speak Japanese.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.654
Oh, shut up.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.343
Piggies.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.882
Oh, yeah I like piggies.

10:42.892 --> 10:43.892
Yeah.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.850
I like piggies, too.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.734
Good.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.430
You know what I'm gonna do?

12:09.437 --> 12:11.019
I'm gonna cancel my flight.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.890
I'm gonna cancel my appointments.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.359
I'm gonna stay here for a few days.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.105
It's true, I've only been
in Japan on business,

12:20.114 --> 12:22.527
and, maybe I thought

12:22.533 --> 12:24.695
you and I could do a
little sightseeing, or...

12:24.702 --> 12:26.284
It sounds nice

12:27.622 --> 12:28.622
but it's impossible.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.169
I see.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.171
You have a husband.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.210
No.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.217
No husband.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.965
Do you have a boyfriend?

12:43.972 --> 12:44.972
No.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.015
Then

12:48.351 --> 12:50.013
I don't understand.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.056
Understand, you must leave now.

12:54.107 --> 12:58.442
I, I will never be able to explain to you

13:00.196 --> 13:01.528
what tonight meant for me.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.856
Thank you.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.788
I don't even know your name.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.335
Kirina.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.129
Kirina.

13:58.546 --> 13:59.546
Goodbye.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.674
Live long.

14:55.103 --> 14:59.939
I was told to do
it as painlessly as possible.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.057
Let me see your face.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.731
Before you kill me, let me see your face.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.905
No one but you has seen my face.

15:57.415 --> 16:00.078
I am known by reputation.

16:06.716 --> 16:07.716
Kirina.

16:09.886 --> 16:13.004
I was sent because he wanted the best.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.347
My skill is unmatched.

16:17.101 --> 16:22.096
It takes great skill to
butcher an unarmed woman.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.106
Enough!

16:25.485 --> 16:28.193
You can die painlessly or slowly.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.135
Choose.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.381
I wish to die slowly

16:58.559 --> 16:59.559
and with much pain

17:00.937 --> 17:03.805
so I remember what it was to be alive.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.982
You have great courage.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.575
But I have orders that it be quick.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.203
I am sorry.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.327
Be sorry for yourself.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.044
I am free.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.505
You are a coward, a slave.

17:36.347 --> 17:37.883
Room 2103.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.847
Send police immediately.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.519
No!

17:50.736 --> 17:52.193
Don't touch him!

18:02.623 --> 18:03.659
Go quickly.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.092
Hi.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.357
No!

23:11.307 --> 23:14.891
Mr. Racine, I have brought
two visitors to see you.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.261
Takeda Sensei and Mrs. Takeda.

23:17.271 --> 23:19.183
Takeda Sensei is a master of Kenjutsu

23:19.189 --> 23:22.398
and a descendant of a
great samurai family.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.519
He believes, and I also believe,

23:25.529 --> 23:27.691
that your life is in great danger.

23:28.866 --> 23:29.866
Danger?

23:30.618 --> 23:31.574
From what?

23:31.577 --> 23:33.318
The men who attacked you,

23:34.330 --> 23:38.540
they are ninja from a
cult called the Makato.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.704
Their leader is named Kinjo.

23:40.711 --> 23:42.998
No one outside of the Makato

23:43.005 --> 23:46.214
has ever seen Kinjo's face and lived.

23:46.216 --> 23:49.755
Nothing can stop them from
finding and killing you.

23:51.013 --> 23:54.177
So, how did they screw
up and leave me alive?

23:57.519 --> 24:00.102
Even monkeys fall out of trees.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.722
But they will not fail a second time.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.771
We must get you out of here immediately.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.191
I'm supposed to believe
I'm safer with you

24:08.197 --> 24:11.156
than in a hospital room
guarded by the police?

24:11.158 --> 24:14.026
We will take you to a safe place.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.402
An island off the coast of...

24:15.412 --> 24:17.369
Listen, listen, listen.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.830
I don't know you,

24:18.832 --> 24:19.832
either of you.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.412
And I don't believe you.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.661
I'm sorry, I can't think anymore.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.008
Mieko.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.865
I'm sorry, but I can't go with you.

24:57.871 --> 24:58.702
Even if I wanted to...

24:58.706 --> 24:59.913
Don't think of it now.

25:05.212 --> 25:08.171
We will stay in Nagoya for two days.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.548
If you need our help,

25:15.305 --> 25:18.013
please call me at this number.

26:05.022 --> 26:06.809
Sujin, Masado, come.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.528
I have called you before me so that

26:17.534 --> 26:19.742
you can fulfill your plan.

26:19.745 --> 26:20.701
Plan, Lord?

26:20.704 --> 26:24.118
Was it not your plan
to have my soul weakened

26:24.124 --> 26:25.615
so you could steal my power?

26:28.420 --> 26:32.755
Why else would you fail to kill
a man who has seen my face?

26:32.758 --> 26:34.465
Lord, it is impossible.

26:34.468 --> 26:35.834
We cut his throat.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.005
He was poisoned!

26:37.012 --> 26:38.423
I'm sure he was dead.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.046
He's alive.

26:40.057 --> 26:43.516
Since you are too well-trained
to make such a mistake,

26:43.519 --> 26:46.102
you must have planned to betray me.

26:48.065 --> 26:51.308
Now it's your opportunity.

26:53.403 --> 26:55.770
The foreigner has stolen
a piece of my soul.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.231
Just kill what remains.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.121
Test me.

27:04.832 --> 27:06.619
See if I have lost my powers.

27:08.252 --> 27:11.290
Master, we failed you,
but are forever loyal!

27:16.677 --> 27:18.134
You betrayed me!

27:21.306 --> 27:23.093
You will not die quickly.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.557
I will bury you up to your neck

27:24.560 --> 27:26.096
and leave you rot in the sun.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.721
Sujin, pick up your sword.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.188
You would have been my successor.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.060
Now, you have only one chance to live.

27:38.323 --> 27:43.318
I now decree, if Sujin kills me in combat

27:43.328 --> 27:46.196
he shall be my rightful
heir and your Lord.

27:47.958 --> 27:48.958
Sujin.

27:51.587 --> 27:52.587
Yeah.

27:53.797 --> 27:54.797
Come on.

28:33.754 --> 28:34.754
Get up!

28:42.888 --> 28:44.004
Here, take it.

28:46.850 --> 28:47.850
Come.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.260
Come!

29:12.042 --> 29:13.123
Make them suffer.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.025
Kirina.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.403
A whore with the face of a goddess

29:43.991 --> 29:46.278
and the spirit of a tiger.

29:50.414 --> 29:53.873
I have killed 100 men and women.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.082
Never hesitated.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.040
I can't believe that the gods

29:58.046 --> 29:59.537
would want such a woman to die.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.008
They must be angry with me.

30:04.886 --> 30:07.924
The gods are not
angry with you, My Lord.

30:08.849 --> 30:11.887
You are haunted by a memory, a ghost.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.808
When a woodsman cuts down a tree

30:15.814 --> 30:19.353
he must allow time for
its spirit to escape.

30:20.569 --> 30:24.404
As the woman died, her
spirit clung to the man.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.616
Cut him down and it will depart.

30:30.537 --> 30:31.537
Yes.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.497
He must die.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.962
I will kill him tonight.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.297
No.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.543
The spell of the woman has poisoned you.

30:46.553 --> 30:47.553
Send another.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.009
Do not tempt the gods.

30:54.728 --> 30:55.728
Junko.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.430
You are wise.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.600
I will send my best men.

31:05.739 --> 31:07.105
They will bring me his head.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.736
And then, it shall be buried forever.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.160
Mr. Racine, what are you doing out of bed?

32:36.163 --> 32:37.950
What am I doing?

32:37.956 --> 32:40.118
I'm getting out of here,
that's what I'm doing.

32:46.465 --> 32:49.424
You've seen too many samurai movies.

32:53.513 --> 32:54.674
You're safest here.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.297
We have taken every precaution.

33:06.610 --> 33:07.942
The stakeout across the street

33:07.944 --> 33:10.277
will make sure no one
can slip in from outside.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.613
There are two more police
officers in the hallway

33:12.616 --> 33:14.699
and a backup is parked outside.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.158
You are safer in this room

33:16.161 --> 33:20.155
than you could be
strolling in Central Park.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.298
What about this ninja cult?

33:32.219 --> 33:33.050
The Makato?

33:33.053 --> 33:34.794
Ah, Dr. Yamura told you that.

33:34.804 --> 33:38.172
He's repeating rumors and superstitions.

33:38.183 --> 33:42.177
There are no ninja cults in modern Japan.

33:51.821 --> 33:52.686
What about Kinjo?

33:52.697 --> 33:54.279
Kinjo?

33:54.282 --> 33:55.739
He told you that, too?

33:55.742 --> 33:56.858
Yeah.

33:56.868 --> 34:00.612
Kinjo is a myth, a boogeyman.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.248
The crime syndicates
encourage these stories

34:04.251 --> 34:06.538
to frighten people.

34:17.472 --> 34:22.012
Supposedly, there's a secret farm town

34:22.936 --> 34:25.098
full of ninjas.

34:25.105 --> 34:28.348
They kidnap children and
train them to be assassins.

34:28.358 --> 34:29.348
It's ridiculous!

34:31.277 --> 34:33.770
This isn't ancient Japan.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.568
We don't have ninja
running around with swords

34:36.574 --> 34:38.658
any more than you have cowboys and Indians

34:38.659 --> 34:40.275
fighting in Manhattan.

34:42.914 --> 34:43.914
In any case

34:45.125 --> 34:48.243
no swordsman can get past
a trained police officer

34:48.253 --> 34:49.960
carrying a modern gun.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.157
Maybe I was

35:28.251 --> 35:29.251
wrong.

35:32.672 --> 35:33.672
Maybe?

40:06.362 --> 40:07.362
Hey.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.200
I need a phone.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.201
A phone.

40:47.946 --> 40:48.732
Hello?

40:48.738 --> 40:49.774
Mr. Racine?

40:49.781 --> 40:50.646
Yes.

40:50.657 --> 40:52.273
Are you all right?

40:52.283 --> 40:54.991
We heard that ninjas
attacked the hospital.

40:54.994 --> 40:56.326
Are you safe?

40:56.329 --> 40:57.661
I don't know.

40:57.664 --> 41:00.156
You think
they are following you?

41:00.166 --> 41:02.249
I don't know.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.958
But I can't wait for you here.

41:07.715 --> 41:08.751
I may need to run.

41:08.758 --> 41:11.125
Can you get
to the railway station?

41:13.221 --> 41:14.221
Maybe.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.090
How do you say, Get me
a taxi, in Japanese?

41:22.438 --> 41:23.438
Okay.

41:30.989 --> 41:31.989
It works.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.231
I'll meet you at the station.

41:34.242 --> 41:35.574
Stand in the open.

41:35.576 --> 41:36.576
I'll find you.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.071
Are you sure you can do it?

41:43.334 --> 41:44.334
We'll see.

41:47.880 --> 41:48.711
Stop!

41:48.715 --> 41:50.047
Stop playing!

41:50.049 --> 41:52.917
Don't you know this is
just a form of gambling?

41:52.927 --> 41:54.463
Know what gambling does to you?

41:54.470 --> 41:56.132
It steals your soul.

41:56.139 --> 41:57.471
Don't touch me!

41:57.473 --> 41:59.465
Gambling causes impotence!

41:59.475 --> 42:02.263
It leads to mental destruction!

42:02.270 --> 42:03.806
It has to stop!

42:13.823 --> 42:14.823
Shit!

42:16.868 --> 42:17.699
Let's go!

42:17.702 --> 42:18.692
Go!

42:18.703 --> 42:19.534
Come on!

42:31.924 --> 42:33.460
Take me to the train station.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.126
Train station.

42:38.765 --> 42:39.972
Train.

42:45.813 --> 42:46.894
Don't ask me.

42:52.653 --> 42:55.817
You're probably going to
take me to the toy store.

43:09.879 --> 43:11.495
Listen.

43:11.506 --> 43:14.874
Keep the change, and take her home.

43:14.884 --> 43:15.884
Home.

43:20.056 --> 43:21.056
Oh, no.

43:21.766 --> 43:23.678
I think you've done enough for tonight.

43:25.478 --> 43:26.559
Bye, angel.

43:29.107 --> 43:30.143
Thank you.

43:30.149 --> 43:31.149
Thanks a lot.

43:32.735 --> 43:33.735
Go home now.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.047
Takeda is impressed, Mr. Racine.

44:00.054 --> 44:00.885
Really?

44:00.888 --> 44:03.551
No one's escaped the Makato before.

44:03.558 --> 44:05.971
Now you've done it twice.

44:05.977 --> 44:09.095
Well, tell him it's not a
skill I wanna keep practicing.

44:10.231 --> 44:11.472
When do we leave?

44:12.400 --> 44:15.268
There is a five a.m.
bullet train for Mihara.

44:15.278 --> 44:17.565
We can take a boat from
there to the island.

44:19.907 --> 44:20.988
Somebody followed you?

44:23.077 --> 44:26.912
I don't think so.

45:09.790 --> 45:10.997
Easy.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.366
It is only water.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.127
Did you have a vision?

45:19.133 --> 45:20.340
I don't know.

45:21.886 --> 45:24.469
A hallucination, maybe.

45:24.472 --> 45:27.590
It is poison from the shurikens.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.308
The ninja use it because it is quick.

45:30.311 --> 45:32.553
In small doses, it helps you to see

45:32.563 --> 45:34.020
into the world of the spirits.

45:35.524 --> 45:37.311
Maybe I'll use some next time

45:37.318 --> 45:38.854
I go to a Grateful Dead concert.

45:43.366 --> 45:44.366
Thank you.

45:56.003 --> 45:56.834
What?

45:56.837 --> 45:58.294
They are here.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.128
How does he know?

45:59.131 --> 46:00.667
It's best to keep moving.

46:02.301 --> 46:04.293
We must trust in Takeda.

46:04.303 --> 46:05.464
He knows.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.286
I gotta rest.

57:22.564 --> 57:23.600
No guns!

57:51.218 --> 57:53.585
What do we do if he loses?

57:53.595 --> 57:55.461
Takeda will not lose.

58:29.506 --> 58:30.917
Racine!

58:30.924 --> 58:31.924
Come here!

58:50.444 --> 58:51.560
Is this Kinjo?

58:55.657 --> 58:56.657
No.

58:58.368 --> 58:59.233
No?

58:59.244 --> 59:00.985
You think I would forget his face?

59:03.707 --> 59:04.707
Is this Kinjo?

59:20.599 --> 59:21.599
Come!

59:30.275 --> 59:31.275
Is this him?

59:34.780 --> 59:39.741
No, it's not him.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.367
Mr. Racine?

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:28.374
Yeah?

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:30.867
Please, follow me.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:31.708
Please.

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:32.827
Okay.

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:49.413
Ah.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:21.478
How did you talk your
way past the police?

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:23.104
It's all right.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.114
We are safe.

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:38.502
Listen, I don't want
to sound ungrateful, but

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:41.168
I would like to know
why you're helping me.

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:43.040
Two centuries ago

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:47.637
a rival clan hired the Makato
to destroy Takeda family.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:49.505
They almost succeeded.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:53.009
The Makato will keep killing
until someone stops them.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:56.228
That is why Takeda hoped
Kinjo was on the train.

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:58.769
Their leader has never lost a battle.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:01.441
That's why you want to help me?

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:04.812
For something that happened
hundreds of years ago?

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:08.442
When Kinjo comes,
Takeda will fight him.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.033
What if he doesn't come?

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:13.366
He will come.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.074
Listen.

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:20.544
I would like to get word to my
company, tell them I'm okay.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:23.998
No.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.927
That would be a mistake.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.513
Kinjo will learn where you are.

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:32.347
You're tired.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.350
Rest.

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:35.138
Yeah.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.145
You're right.

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.137
Thank you.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.605
I will take you to your room.

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:40.607
Okay?

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:49.611
What a beautiful place.

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:51.483
Isn't it?

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:40.376
Oshima!

01:05:57.662 --> 01:05:59.528
You, go away.

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:09.923
My Lord.

01:06:11.509 --> 01:06:12.509
The...

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:14.595
I know.

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:17.717
They're dead.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:26.230
I send my best men to be
slaughtered by a ghost

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:27.393
that only I could kill.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:29.401
Junko.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:32.353
She was also.

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:35.989
I should have never
listened to that woman.

01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:40.528
Send out all our spies.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:41.949
I want to know everything that happened.

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:43.697
I want to know where he is.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:48.623
Not heaven nor hell can
stop me from killing a man.

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:51.715
Now leave me.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:04.806
This ghost that will not die.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.311
Who is hunting whom?

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:12.486
I wonder.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:01.867
Excuse me?

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:16.425
The other one?

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:24.174
You know, I'm not exactly
in good shape right now, but

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:27.051
I guess, oh thanks.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.017
Thanks.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:28.932
Yeah.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.270
That's much better.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.809
Thank you, thank you.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:38.316
What are you doing?

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:45.197
Thanks a lot.

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:47.412
That's much better.

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:48.622
Thank you.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:49.625
Shit.

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:53.577
What does he think I am, a donkey?

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:05.555
Okay, I'm gonna head back to the castle.

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:07.470
It was a lovely afternoon.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.221
Excuse me.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:15.519
That's nice.

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:22.819
Oh, water.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:23.656
Thank you.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.660
That's nice.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.448
Are you crazy?

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:34.835
God, sake.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:35.667
My God!

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:36.671
Sake.

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:42.511
Oh, God.

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:48.430
My God, it's the worst sake.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:52.395
Thank you.

01:09:58.111 --> 01:10:00.945
Well, it's not that bad after all.

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:02.948
He tricked me.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.948
He tricked me with this
cheap homemade sake.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:11.951
I wish I could speak Japanese

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:17.453
so this guy would understand
the meaning of the words,

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:18.749
I'm not a donkey.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:27.429
Hey, come on.

01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:28.263
Okay?

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:31.304
I've been cleaning this
five times already.

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.017
Stop the dust!

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:33.806
Okay?

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:35.179
I'm doing you a favor.

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:37.146
Don't take advantage of me.

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:39.776
Then do it yourself.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:54.039
I have seen one before.

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:10.384
Are you sure?

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:14.093
This doesn't feel right.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.014
It should be it's a sword.

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:18.977
Take it easy.

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:20.190
Where's he going?

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:24.696
Apple.

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:30.696
That was great.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:36.958
Thanks.

01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:41.290
It's even better.

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.501
Listen.

01:11:44.509 --> 01:11:45.509
Can you teach me?

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:59.118
This better be your sister.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:02.711
Put it down.

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:06.334
I don't like you having
pictures of other girls around.

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:10.300
What's so special about this one?

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:15.765
Put it down.

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:20.010
There, it's down.

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.601
You little whore!

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:28.193
You better learn to respect me!

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:38.119
Who are you?

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:39.658
What?

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:40.665
Kinjo!

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:44.960
What are you doing here?

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:46.169
How did you get in?

01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:49.089
Leave silently.

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:50.967
Don't come back.

01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:55.963
Why did you kill Kirina?

01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.717
I didn't.

01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:00.727
You killed her.

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:03.845
Why did you have her killed?

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:10.193
She defied me.

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:13.573
How?

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.988
She asked to leave me.

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:20.904
Why?

01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:21.915
I don't know.

01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:26.586
Why?

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:28.916
I bought her in Soapland.

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:33.300
Her mother died at birth.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:36.716
Her pimp uncle sold her
to people worse than me.

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:40.841
I gave her fine clothes, jewels.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:42.888
Everything!

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:44.136
Expensive things!

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:49.019
Why did you kill her?

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:52.360
She begged me for freedom for years.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:58.655
Then demanded it, freedom
from me, Boss Nemura!

01:14:58.661 --> 01:14:59.661
I told her

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:04.239
if she left me, I would kill her.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.366
And?

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:07.660
She left me.

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:03.400
Racine,

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:04.410
outside.

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:43.482
So, you want to study Kenjutsu.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.824
No.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:47.820
We were just fooling around.

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:48.911
Killing time.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:50.701
Time does not die.

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:52.199
Only people.

01:17:52.209 --> 01:17:53.575
Come, I'll teach you.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:58.254
You have much to learn.

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:03.303
Right hand!

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:06.550
In Japan, no left hand.

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:23.863
Didn't that drunk teach you anything?

01:18:24.825 --> 01:18:26.407
Let's find out.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:27.821
Attack!

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:28.719
The lesson is not over yet.

01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:32.803
It is finished.

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:36.560
No, I still have much to learn.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:48.155
Don't mock me, Racine.

01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:02.629
So the old drunk taught
me something after all.

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:12.054
Enough.

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:14.925
I could have killed you 10 times.

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:15.935
Why didn't you?

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:20.889
I'm learning, Takeda.

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:23.437
Finally learning.

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:26.026
Why don't you kill me?

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:27.778
You want to.

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:29.238
I can see it in your eyes.

01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:34.619
Stop fighting.

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:38.490
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.991
His English isn't...

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:42.585
He understands English when he wants to.

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:44.545
Ask him why he's so sure that Kinjo

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:46.414
will come on this island.

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:47.836
I know ninja.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:50.085
No, the trail is cold by now.

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:53.509
If Kinjo knew where I was, he
would've showed up long ago.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:54.631
Kinjo will come.

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:56.473
Of course, he will come.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:58.594
Because you'll tell him I'm here.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:01.187
That's how Kinjo's men
found us on the train.

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:03.852
You sent word to them.

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:07.025
It's true, isn't it?

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.356
Ask him if it's true!

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.278
They would find you anyway.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:16.153
No, not on a train filled
with innocent people.

01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:18.621
They were slaughtered so
you could test your skill!

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:21.332
Paul, please!

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:22.416
Don't make him angry.

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:23.626
Takeda won't hurt me.

01:21:25.255 --> 01:21:26.621
He also won't let me leave.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.708
I'm your prisoner, right?

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:30.718
You are free to go.

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:35.714
See how long you live
without me to protect you!

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:38.307
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:40.472
I'm taking the first
flight back to New York.

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:42.596
And I'm gonna send Kinjo a postcard,

01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:44.689
see how well he does on my turf.

01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:19.307
Sorry, Mr. Racine.

01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:21.266
I request that you stay.

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:23.974
Request or command?

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:27.106
It will be foolish for you to leave.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.102
You think I don't know what's going on?

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:32.945
Do you really think a bunch of kids

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:34.905
can take on professional assassins?

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:38.443
You're going to get them all killed.

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:39.740
But I'm not gonna let you.

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:42.447
The bait is leaving.

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.825
This is between me and Kinjo.

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.451
It's between him and me, me!

01:22:47.588 --> 01:22:49.625
So, get the hell out of the way!

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:55.335
Not bad for a gaijin.

01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:06.679
Very good for gaijin.

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:30.545
Takeda?

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:35.087
He wants to challenge you in combat.

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:38.052
If you come alone and defeat him,

01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:39.967
Racine will be handed to you.

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:41.930
So anxious to die.

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:45.473
Then send word that you accept?

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:50.181
Of course.

01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:05.030
I came to say goodbye.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.281
Help me escape.

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:08.916
Kinjo only wants me.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:14.172
Everyone is in danger as long
as I'm here, and you know it!

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:17.341
I must stand by my husband,

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:20.011
even if I die.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.176
You will be safe here.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:25.675
I will see to it.

01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:39.567
Hey, can you help me?

01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:54.658
Oh, God, it's gonna take a week.

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:42.501
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:29:57.642 --> 01:29:59.929
Yeah, in the boat.

01:30:09.279 --> 01:30:10.770
Thanks for helping.

01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:21.197
Mieko.

01:30:21.207 --> 01:30:22.994
I can't leave Mieko.

01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:30.506
I can't keep running away.

01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:34.669
It's got to end here one way or another.

01:30:36.306 --> 01:30:38.889
If I've learned anything from Kirina

01:30:38.892 --> 01:30:41.430
it's that you have to accept
your fate with courage.

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:45.308
So, I'm gonna try.

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:48.849
You go.

01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.901
Yes, yes.

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:54.490
Yes.

01:30:56.534 --> 01:30:57.399
Thank you.

01:31:12.926 --> 01:31:14.633
Have a drink on me.

01:39:21.038 --> 01:39:22.404
Looking for me?

01:39:51.068 --> 01:39:52.068
Left hand.

01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:54.777
Maybe I got a chance.

01:41:13.693 --> 01:41:15.104
Break the sword.

01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:18.691
It's a living symbol of the Makato.

01:41:19.865 --> 01:41:23.609
Once it is broken they are finished.

01:43:02.134 --> 01:43:03.545
Don't you ever give up?

01:44:11.203 --> 01:44:12.203
Thanks.

01:44:15.541 --> 01:44:16.541
Takeda?

01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:25.550
But

01:44:26.677 --> 01:44:28.634
he will rest easier now.

01:44:30.431 --> 01:44:31.431
I'm sorry.

01:44:34.727 --> 01:44:36.013
Let me help you.

01:45:12.723 --> 01:45:15.807
I don't want to say
you're late, but it's over.
