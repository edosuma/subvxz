WEBVTT

00:09.218 --> 00:11.095
(PANTING)

00:17.727 --> 00:19.353
Batteries.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.151
Why don't they just come?

00:25.860 --> 00:27.653
What are they waiting for?

00:27.862 --> 00:29.071
Godot.

00:32.742 --> 00:33.951
Okay.

00:44.295 --> 00:48.382
M-A-M-J-J-A-S-O.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.884
What letter comes next?

00:50.092 --> 00:52.094
Uh, "N."

00:52.261 --> 00:53.721
March, April, May, June, July,

00:53.888 --> 00:56.432
August, September, October,
November.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.268
- Who's chasing you, man?
- Batteries.

00:59.477 --> 01:01.062
Oh, right.
Here you go.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.521
Try this one, Einstein.

01:02.688 --> 01:03.939
I'm looking for a word.

01:04.106 --> 01:05.586
The first two letters
indicate a male,

01:05.775 --> 01:06.776
the first three a female,

01:06.942 --> 01:08.611
the first four a great man,

01:08.778 --> 01:10.237
the whole word a great woman.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.822
What's the word?

01:12.031 --> 01:13.157
Tricky.

01:13.324 --> 01:14.700
Matt?

01:16.368 --> 01:19.038
If I wanted to go to school,
I would've stayed home.

01:20.331 --> 01:21.957
Nice talking with you.

01:24.335 --> 01:25.336
Got it.

01:25.461 --> 01:27.713
He, her, hero, heroine.

01:28.047 --> 01:29.548
Yeah, that's way too easy.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.300
(LAUGHING)

01:34.261 --> 01:35.261
I thought the bubbleheads

01:35.387 --> 01:37.431
put up a safety net
around Charleston.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.559
That's why God made people
like you, Craze, not to think.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.622
What I'm trying to say is,
if they did,

01:42.686 --> 01:43.846
why is it necessary for Mason

01:43.979 --> 01:45.499
to have us
practically living out here?

01:45.856 --> 01:46.982
She's got a point.

01:47.183 --> 01:49.503
What the hell do you think's
gonna happen if we get invaded

01:49.527 --> 01:50.903
while those bubbleheaded
bastards are over there

01:51.112 --> 01:52.988
roasting wienies
in their compound, huh?

01:53.364 --> 01:54.907
We all get scorched.

01:55.241 --> 01:56.575
I'm not taking any chances.

01:56.784 --> 01:57.952
Maybe the Professor's wrong.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.440
Maybe the fishheads
aren't coming.

01:59.537 --> 02:00.537
Oh, they're coming.

02:00.663 --> 02:02.915
You can throw out a mosquito net
the size of Texas.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.124
What happens, huh?

02:04.291 --> 02:06.168
One always gets through.

02:06.312 --> 02:07.312
That's why we're here.

02:07.336 --> 02:08.003
They are coming.

02:08.147 --> 02:09.147
If not today, tomorrow.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.548
And if not tomorrow,
the day after that.

02:10.714 --> 02:11.754
And when they do get here,

02:11.799 --> 02:14.343
I am gonna
fry me some fishhead ass.

02:16.262 --> 02:17.805
Little man,
what do you got for me?

02:18.139 --> 02:19.139
All the good stuff.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.724
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.727
I got you some cinnamon buns.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.563
Cinnamon buns, huh?

02:26.647 --> 02:27.898
Coffee.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.526
All right.

02:30.985 --> 02:33.237
You're gonna make one hell
of a thief one day, kid.

02:33.404 --> 02:34.404
Thanks.

02:34.613 --> 02:35.364
<i>Pope: Oh, this is great.</i>

02:35.531 --> 02:36.771
<i>Where'd you get all this stuff?</i>

02:36.782 --> 02:38.062
<i>Matt: You want more of anything?</i>

02:56.385 --> 02:58.304
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

03:03.726 --> 03:05.561
He looks like Frankenstein.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.022
At least
he's walking without crutches.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.191
Yeah, I thought
he'd be happier about it.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.109
I'm happier about it.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.196
How are you, Maggie?

03:16.697 --> 03:17.823
Long day-

03:22.995 --> 03:24.830
Looks like my day
is just beginning.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.497
Hal.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.633
What I'm saying is,
outside the military,

03:35.799 --> 03:36.799
there's maybe four people

03:36.967 --> 03:38.447
that know exactly
how this place runs.

03:38.594 --> 03:39.803
What are you worried about?

03:40.012 --> 03:41.597
What am I worried about?

03:43.196 --> 03:45.076
I'm worried about
picking somebody strong enough

03:45.100 --> 03:46.685
to stand up to them
if anything should happen to me.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.562
Any of the guys you're
considering can do the job,

03:48.729 --> 03:49.563
but unless you're planning on

03:49.730 --> 03:50.856
being impeached
or getting a stroke,

03:51.023 --> 03:52.691
I don't think
we have to worry about it.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.860
In the last two years,
I've been kidnapped,

03:55.069 --> 03:57.279
tortured, shot,
implanted with an eye worm.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.823
Last week, I was almost
torn apart by a harnessed kid

04:00.032 --> 04:01.825
and contaminated
by a nuclear reactor.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.662
I think we can count on
something happening, don't you?

04:05.204 --> 04:06.538
- Dan.
- Tom.

04:06.888 --> 04:08.808
I thought I was supposed to have
Anthony's report

04:08.832 --> 04:10.512
on that investigation
on my desk yesterday.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.744
I talked to him this morning.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.275
You'll have it
by the end of the day.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.463
Thank you.

04:15.066 --> 04:16.066
Jeanne?

04:16.090 --> 04:17.341
We gonna be ready by tonight?

04:17.508 --> 04:18.550
8 o'clock, right?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.637
Unless the world
falls off its axis.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.347
We'll be ready.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.892
You know, when you first
pitched me this idea,

04:27.059 --> 04:28.727
I wasn't too sure about it.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.313
But now I see
what you're going for.

04:31.647 --> 04:32.898
The tree of life.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.109
The tree of life.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.986
The tree of... Liberty.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.529
Liberty Tree.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.197
Yeah.
The Liberty Tree.

04:40.364 --> 04:41.532
I like that.

04:41.699 --> 04:42.825
This is good.

04:42.992 --> 04:43.993
Carry on.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.079
I'm gonna have to make a speech.

04:47.288 --> 04:48.649
I'm gonna need
some kind of speech.

04:48.664 --> 04:49.957
Here.
It's boilerplate,

04:50.124 --> 04:51.792
but it'll give you
something to work with.

04:54.003 --> 04:57.047
Mm. Mm!

04:57.464 --> 04:58.674
Hey, where you going?

04:58.841 --> 05:00.634
I got to hit the bushes.

05:00.801 --> 05:01.927
Craze?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.847
Take your snow tires.

05:13.439 --> 05:14.648
All right.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.911
She's old enough
to be your grandmother, kid.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.370
I heard that!

05:29.413 --> 05:30.956
- I wasn't talking to you.
- (LAUGHING)

05:31.332 --> 05:32.791
Ah, give the kid a break, Pope.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.169
It's probably the most exciting
thing he's ever seen.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.296
That true?

05:37.588 --> 05:38.630
Pretty much.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.591
Oh, man. That is sad.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.426
(GUNSHOT)

05:45.429 --> 05:46.597
You stay down, kid.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.891

- Yeah. Yeah.

05:51.769 --> 05:52.811

05:53.354 --> 05:54.354

05:54.480 --> 05:55.689
I'm on it! Go!

05:55.898 --> 05:57.024
I got this!

05:59.485 --> 06:00.485
Craze?

06:00.486 --> 06:02.071
What's going on?

06:07.854 --> 06:10.055
What's going on is this stupid
vest just saved your ass.

- Ah!

06:11.205 --> 06:12.539
Son of a bitch!
Come on, look. We got to move!

06:12.748 --> 06:13.749
- Pope! Pope!
- Let's go!

06:13.957 --> 06:15.334
I can't see.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.891
Don't move, okay?
I'll be right back.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.643
No! Don't leave me!

06:32.810 --> 06:34.770
Craze, you fell
on a piece of rebar.

06:34.937 --> 06:35.938
It's sticking
into the back of your head.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.439
- You can't feel that?
- No.

06:37.648 --> 06:39.688
I'm gonna get some...
I'm gonna get some help, okay?

06:39.691 --> 06:41.171
I will be right back.
You do not move.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.360
Tector!

06:42.361 --> 06:43.361
Go!

06:46.824 --> 06:47.950
I need a hacksaw.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.161
What's up?

06:52.204 --> 06:53.765
We're taking fire
on the perimeter, Tom.

06:53.789 --> 06:54.665
- How bad?
- Bressler: I'm not sure.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.583
Right now, it seems to be
confined to the northern sector.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.670
The 2nd Mass is out there...
Ben, Matt.

06:59.878 --> 07:00.963
Could be an advance.
Could be a probe.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.297
Or it could be
the Espheni offensive

07:02.464 --> 07:03.590
the rebel Skitters
have been warning us about.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.758
I got to get up there.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.301
Mr. President,
you being out there

07:06.428 --> 07:07.668
isn't gonna change a damn thing

07:07.678 --> 07:08.679
till we know
what we're dealing with.

07:08.887 --> 07:09.930
You'll be here, right?

07:10.264 --> 07:11.264
Where else would I be?

07:11.390 --> 07:12.599
Then you don't need me.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.644
All right.

(GUNFIRE, SHOUTING)

Hey!

You seen your brother?

07:27.990 --> 07:29.324
Came by, changed our batteries,
and headed out.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.251
- What do we got?
- Ghosts. Lots of firepower.

- Harnessed kids?
- Don't know.

07:33.537 --> 07:34.537
At least six, maybe more.

- Where's he from?
- Weaver: I don't know.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.369
If he's the real deal,

08:14.578 --> 08:15.913
he could be
an expeditionary force

08:16.079 --> 08:17.873
or he could be some nut job

08:18.081 --> 08:20.209
who ransacked
an army-surplus store.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.251
We should try and talk to them,

let them know
we're on the same side.

08:23.629 --> 08:24.990
If they were
interested in talking,

08:25.005 --> 08:27.216
they would've approached us
before they attacked us.

right now.

hanging over our heads.

- I don't like it, either.

okay?

11:06.041 --> 11:09.378
And she said, "Don't,"
and pulled her foot away.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.382
Then, when I was examining
her blood in the microscope,

11:13.548 --> 11:15.509
she said, "Mommy."

11:16.259 --> 11:18.720
And when I turned around,
she was standing there

11:18.970 --> 11:19.971
in the crib.

Looking at me, Lourdes.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.812

11:27.270 --> 11:28.897
Why... Why were you
taking her blood?

11:29.064 --> 11:30.273
Is something wrong with her?

11:30.440 --> 11:31.817
It's not normal, Lourdes.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.443
Whatever it is,
whatever's going on with her,

11:33.652 --> 11:35.362
- it is not normal!
- Okay. Okay.

I believe you.

I'm just trying to help.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.788
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

11:47.207 --> 11:48.333
You seen my son?

11:48.542 --> 11:50.335
He's next door with Pope.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.546
- Matt!
- Matt: Dad!

11:52.713 --> 11:53.839
Stay where you are!

11:53.964 --> 11:55.215
Pope: I got him, Professor.

11:55.882 --> 11:56.967
What do you got?

11:57.134 --> 11:58.885
Library.
Upper right side.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.679
- You sure?
- Yeah.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.931
I saw the muzzle flash.
He's there.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.599
That's where I'd be.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.288
So, what are we up against,
Professor?

12:06.476 --> 12:08.478
I'm not sure...
human beings.

12:08.635 --> 12:09.956
What the hell they got
against us?

12:09.980 --> 12:11.982
That's the $64 million question.

12:12.816 --> 12:13.900
Medevacs are in.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.869
Western sector reports
two Humvees moving out

12:15.944 --> 12:17.279
across the Cooper River bridge.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.864
Okay.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.910
If he's in there,
he just lost his ride home.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.162
You ready?

12:27.456 --> 12:28.456
Hey!

12:28.957 --> 12:30.625
We're humans over here!

12:32.210 --> 12:33.336
Stop shooting!

12:33.920 --> 12:35.672
We want to talk!

12:37.215 --> 12:38.592
Can you hear me?!

12:44.431 --> 12:46.016
So much for talking.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.938
(GRUNTING)

12:57.152 --> 12:58.236
He...

12:59.112 --> 13:00.781
She is still alive.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.575
We can't question her
if she's dead.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.452
This bitch shot Craze.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.622
Killing her
won't change that, son.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.799
You sure this is gonna work?

13:19.007 --> 13:20.258
Just hold her still, okay?

13:20.425 --> 13:21.635
Yeah.
Don't distract him, kid.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.970
He might cut off your fingers.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.433
I had this dog when I was a kid.

13:29.601 --> 13:33.104
Man, that dog could do tricks.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.315
I'd put a treat on her nose,

13:35.482 --> 13:38.151
and she'd just sit there
for, like, five minutes.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.905
She could smile, too.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.242
She had
the most beautiful smile.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.037
What was her name?

13:49.287 --> 13:50.330
Annabel.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.834
Sounds... regal.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.086
Yeah.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.879
Yeah, she was.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.506
Till her hind legs went out

13:59.714 --> 14:02.133
and she started
pissing all over the house.

14:02.676 --> 14:06.721
Then, one day...
she just won't eat anymore.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.474
That's a real uplifting story,
Craze.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.810
Shut up.
I'm trying to make a point here.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.062
What's your point?

14:17.065 --> 14:18.149
My point is...

14:19.484 --> 14:21.278
Her time had come, you know?

14:21.862 --> 14:23.071
Time for what?

14:24.281 --> 14:25.907
Pope knows.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.786
We're gonna get you out of here.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.039
I'm not gonna let you
die in this hole, okay?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.083
I promise.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.879
Keep sawing.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.084
Oh, I didn't know you were back.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.257
Cancel my afternoon meetings.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.474
Tom, can I talk to you?

14:51.641 --> 14:52.976
I'm sorry, Lourdes.
I don't really have time

14:53.101 --> 14:54.311
- right now.
- It's about Anne.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.397
Thank you.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.901
I found her in the lab
with Alexis this morning.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.194
She was doing a blood workup
on the baby.

15:03.475 --> 15:04.755
So, you're worried about Alexis?

15:04.779 --> 15:06.281
No. Anne.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.744
She's not in good shape, Tom.

15:11.286 --> 15:12.287
I think it's possible

15:12.454 --> 15:14.372
she's suffering
from postpartum depression,

15:14.581 --> 15:15.999
maybe even psychosis.

15:16.499 --> 15:20.086
She believes the baby is
talking to her and standing up

15:20.295 --> 15:22.505
and behaving in ways
that just aren't possible

15:22.672 --> 15:24.132
for a S-week-old infant.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.179
I appreciate you
letting me know.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.430
Tom.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.933
I did all the routine tests
on Alexis when she was born.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.559
They were normal.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.937
There's nothing wrong with her.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.564
Has Anne talked to you
about any of this?

15:41.399 --> 15:42.442
Urn...

15:54.663 --> 15:55.914
Where you going?

15:59.250 --> 16:00.585
I'm leaving.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.713
I don't understand.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.884
Maggie...
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

16:08.551 --> 16:09.719
God!

16:10.387 --> 16:11.972
What is going on with you?!

16:14.891 --> 16:16.184
You know how you accused me

16:16.393 --> 16:18.019
of holding something back,

16:18.228 --> 16:19.521
keeping secrets from you?

16:20.730 --> 16:21.940
I was right, wasn't I?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.609
Those dreams I've been having
aren't dreams.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.153
I've been going to see Karen.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.240
She implanted something in me.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.951
She controls me...
or part of me.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.327
All I know for sure

16:34.536 --> 16:35.912
is that I've been
going to see her.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.455
Okay.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.459
So, we get it out...
the bug.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.586
- It's too late for that, Maggie.
- No, it's not too late.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.296
We'll go to the infirmary.
We'll talk to Anne!

16:45.505 --> 16:47.666
Listen to what I have to say!
I am the President's son.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.552
I have access to information,

16:51.011 --> 16:52.721
and Karen wants information.

16:54.472 --> 16:55.765
We have a mole.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.036
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Hal, you're not the mole!

16:59.060 --> 17:01.062
And if you think I'm letting you
out there where Karen is,

17:01.271 --> 17:02.397
you're crazy.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.399
I have to go.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.694
Fine.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.083
Every relationship
I've ever been in

17:22.292 --> 17:23.376
has ended just like this.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.045
Something happens
that I don't like,

17:25.253 --> 17:28.089
and my head explodes,
and I bail.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.008
But not this time.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.344
I'm not giving up on you,
Hal Mason.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.014
I don't care
what that bitch has done to you

17:36.222 --> 17:37.557
or what she's made you do.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.350
We're gonna undo it, okay?

17:40.143 --> 17:41.269
You hear me?

17:44.898 --> 17:46.357
I'm not gonna let her win.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.787
I'm sorry.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.581
- What for?
- For being an ass.

18:04.417 --> 18:09.506
This job, it's, like,
25 hours a day, eight days a week,

18:10.006 --> 18:11.341
and I don't think I realized

18:11.508 --> 18:13.468
the toll
that it was taking on us.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.513
With this invasion
hanging over our heads,

18:16.679 --> 18:20.016
I've been...
more than preoccupied.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.102
I've been neglectful,
and I'm sorry.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.105
You knew
what you were getting into

18:25.313 --> 18:26.981
when you said yes to this job.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.659
Lourdes came to see me.

18:42.914 --> 18:45.875
Listen, you don't have to
go through this alone,

18:46.334 --> 18:47.585
whatever it is.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.671
We're in it together.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.593
I know that I haven't
really been doing my part,

18:52.632 --> 18:53.632
but that's gonna change.

18:53.758 --> 18:54.801
From now on,
I'm gonna be there for you.

18:55.009 --> 18:58.388
You have no idea
what you're talking about, Tom.

19:01.933 --> 19:02.976
Okay, you're right.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.395
Why don't you tell me
what's going on with you?

19:05.603 --> 19:06.938
You're not gonna like it.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.690
I'll keep an open mind.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.026
I don't think she's human.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.346
The rebar runs approximately

19:40.555 --> 19:42.223
across
the middle cerebral artery.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.184
The dark color here is blood

19:44.392 --> 19:46.561
because the artery
has been ruptured

19:46.769 --> 19:48.104
and she's hemorrhaging.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.023
- Is that why she can't see?
- No.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.192
The occipital lobe here
controls sight.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.944
And the rebar went through that,
ended up over here,

19:55.111 --> 19:56.871
missing the temporal lobe,
which is in front.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.531
That's why
she's still able to talk.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.243
We're not pulling
that thing out, are we?

20:02.994 --> 20:05.830
Right now, the rebar is the
only thing keeping her alive.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.249
It's acting like a cork.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.127
- So, as soon as we...
- I got it.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.343
The key is the fold.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.845
It's all in the fold.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.183
So, you want to tell me
what happened today?

20:26.851 --> 20:29.354
Your mom says that you've been
talking up a storm

20:29.896 --> 20:32.023
and standing around
in your crib,

20:32.398 --> 20:33.816
staring at her.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.152
What's next, the 100-yard dash?

20:37.695 --> 20:40.114
You know you're not supposed to
be doing any of that, right?

20:42.367 --> 20:44.619
See, this is where
the wings come into play.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.081
You just fold it over
like that...

20:49.749 --> 20:51.209
and pin.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.048
See?
It's all in the fold.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.134
I'm not crazy.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.595
I know.

21:03.554 --> 21:04.973
But have you looked at her
lately?

21:05.390 --> 21:06.711
I don't mean
through a microscope.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.559
I mean, have you
really looked at her?

21:08.977 --> 21:10.645
She's beautiful.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.858
Ten fingers. Ten toes.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.530
No claws. No scales.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.909
She's perfect.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.547
They've taken
almost everything from us.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.507
Don't let them take her.
Don't...

21:40.717 --> 21:42.093
Don't do that.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.138
I am not crazy, Tom.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.642
You're going through something,
though.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.270
I'm not a doctor.
I don't know what it is.

21:53.767 --> 21:55.207
Dad, sniper's
regained consciousness.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.983
Wait for me outside, please.

22:01.446 --> 22:02.822
I love you.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.037
And I'm here.

22:15.752 --> 22:16.919
I'll see you later.

22:25.219 --> 22:26.262
She say anything?

22:26.429 --> 22:27.764
Name, rank, serial number,

22:27.930 --> 22:29.432
and a few choice words
for my spikes.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.226
Bressler: Why were you firing
on my soldiers?

22:35.772 --> 22:37.732
What are you doing here?
What are you looking for?

22:38.274 --> 22:40.818
Katherine Fisher.
First Lieutenant.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.404
- Serial number 02...
- 022487.

22:43.571 --> 22:44.851
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.282
Unless you want
to get out the water board,

22:46.449 --> 22:47.825
I don't see her telling us much.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.619
Well, I hope it doesn't
come to that, Colonel.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.954
Figure of speech, sir.
Figure of speech.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.126
You hungry?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.088
Did you offer her any water?

23:00.755 --> 23:02.465
She hasn't asked for any.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.801
- Tom: Ben.
- Yep.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.054
Tell you what.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.264
Since you don't feel
like talking,

23:10.890 --> 23:12.809
how about I guess
what I think happened,

23:13.017 --> 23:15.019
and if I'm wrong,
you can feel free to disagree?

23:15.186 --> 23:16.229
You're wasting your time.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.564
Maybe, but I got five minutes.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.901
I think you've been out there
checking us out.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.070
Maybe for a day, two.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.696
Maybe more.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.117
I think you saw us working
with Skitters, spiked kids.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.786
I think you saw aliens
you hadn't seen before.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.204
And you probably thought

23:33.329 --> 23:34.969
that you'd stumbled
into an alien compound

23:35.039 --> 23:37.041
filled with human collaborators.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.459
Am I right?

23:40.169 --> 23:41.504
The world has changed,
Lieutenant.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.881
We are no longer fighting
the Espheni by ourselves.

23:44.048 --> 23:46.717
The Skitters that you saw
are rebels fighting with us.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.178
And the aliens you saw
are a race called the Volm,

23:49.345 --> 23:51.180
also our allies.

24:14.495 --> 24:15.935
You really want
to know what I think?

24:16.038 --> 24:17.038
Yes.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.917
I think the only good alien's
a dead alien.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.214
Colonel,
who the hell is this bozo?

24:25.381 --> 24:26.462
You best not let your mouth

24:26.632 --> 24:28.050
overload your tail there,
soldier,

24:28.217 --> 24:30.011
or this could go south
real quick.

24:30.511 --> 24:33.931
That man is the President
of the new United States,

24:34.140 --> 24:36.184
and you'd do well
to show some respect.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.817
You think
something's funny about that?

24:47.320 --> 24:49.322
I work for the President, sir...

24:50.156 --> 24:52.450
the real President,
Benjamin Hathaway.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.999
Who do you think sent me here?

25:06.005 --> 25:08.049
If it is the case,
I guarantee you

25:08.257 --> 25:09.759
her squad is hightailing it back

25:09.926 --> 25:11.385
to whatever hole
the President is hiding in.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.304
They're gonna tell him we're
collaborating with the enemy,

25:13.513 --> 25:15.033
and he's not gonna
look kindly upon us.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.098
Unless she's making it all up.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.586
She could be
spinning a fairy tale

25:17.683 --> 25:18.683
about President Hathaway.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.937
Well, if she isn't,
they'll be back in force.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.438
If she is, then we need
to get to the President,

25:22.647 --> 25:23.689
tell him what the hell
we're doing here.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.316
Professor, we're on high alert,

25:25.525 --> 25:27.527
anticipating
an Espheni strike any day.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.655
Every man, woman, and child
who can fire a weapon

25:30.863 --> 25:32.573
or fill a sandbag is spoken for.

25:32.783 --> 25:34.384
We can't afford
to be sending anybody out

25:34.408 --> 25:36.327
- on a wild goose chase right now.
- We can't afford not to, General.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.204
You really want to be fighting
this war on two fronts

25:38.412 --> 25:39.872
against the Espheni
and ourselves?

25:40.081 --> 25:41.541
If Benjamin Hathaway is alive,

25:41.707 --> 25:43.125
we don't know where he is.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.002
Unless we take the gloves off,

25:45.211 --> 25:46.796
that sniper's not gonna tell us.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.639
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

26:04.438 --> 26:05.565
- Hey-
- Hey-

26:05.773 --> 26:07.441
I thought you might be hungry.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.820
- And thirsty.
- (CHUCKLING)

26:11.070 --> 26:12.530
That must've set you back.

26:17.952 --> 26:19.996
I'm sorry about this morning.

26:20.162 --> 26:21.763
I shouldn't have
spoken to you like that.

26:21.872 --> 26:22.915
I'm sorry.

26:23.207 --> 26:24.417
That's okay.

26:25.126 --> 26:26.252
How you feeling?

26:26.711 --> 26:27.920
I'm fine.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.090
I'm not fine.
I don't know.

26:33.509 --> 26:36.429
I mean, looking at her now,

26:36.637 --> 26:40.266
she's everything I could've
wanted Tom's and my child to be.

26:41.517 --> 26:42.727
But?

26:44.437 --> 26:47.189
But I stopped believing
in Santa Claus two years ago.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.447
You want to know what I think?

26:55.489 --> 26:56.574
Thank you.

26:58.367 --> 27:01.704
I think for two years,
all we did was run.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.497
We survived by doing things

27:03.706 --> 27:05.583
we never thought
we'd be capable of.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.843
And now that we're settled down
in Charleston,

27:07.918 --> 27:09.754
it's catching up to us.

27:10.713 --> 27:13.049
We're all suffering
on some level.

27:15.801 --> 27:16.927
I just...

27:17.428 --> 27:19.889
I can't afford
to fall apart right now.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.517
- (SOBBING) You know?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

27:26.771 --> 27:28.731
I don't have to be back
at work until tomorrow.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.359
I can stay here all night
if you need me to.

27:32.610 --> 27:33.819
Thank you.

27:39.033 --> 27:40.242
Wait.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.496
Did Tom send you here?

27:46.916 --> 27:49.210
He doesn't even trust me
with my own baby.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.339
- He trusts you, Anne.
- Just leave.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.927
- Leave, Lourdes! Now!
- I'm sorry.

27:59.053 --> 28:00.554
I'm sorry, I...

28:00.930 --> 28:03.057
Tom asked me to stay
until he got home.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.572
How you doing, Bear?

28:18.781 --> 28:19.990
Hi, Dad.

28:21.659 --> 28:22.660
I brought you

28:22.827 --> 28:24.161
some hot chocolate.

28:25.830 --> 28:29.125
Jeanne: Mm. Hot. Thank you.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.419
I like this.
This is...

28:31.877 --> 28:33.003
This is good.

28:33.337 --> 28:36.215
I... I think
people are gonna like it, yeah.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.009
If anyone lives to see it.

28:43.514 --> 28:45.433
The Espheni are coming, Dad.

28:45.683 --> 28:47.101
We all know it.

28:47.727 --> 28:49.007
That makes
what you're doing here

28:49.103 --> 28:50.312
unimportant, a waste of time?

28:50.521 --> 28:51.731
No, sweetheart.

28:52.857 --> 28:53.858
This is...

28:55.109 --> 28:56.610
We're all gonna die.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.989
Yes. Someday.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.866
Someday, I surely plan to.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.243
I mean at their hands.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.620
Maybe.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.499
But as long as we're here,

29:11.459 --> 29:13.586
we can't stop doing what we do,

29:14.170 --> 29:15.838
being who we are.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.633
Otherwise,
we're just already dead,

29:19.800 --> 29:22.470
dead on our feet,
and what good is that?

29:27.183 --> 29:29.059
How do you stay so optimistic?

29:29.810 --> 29:31.187
If I'm optimistic,

29:31.395 --> 29:33.355
it's because I got
something worth dying for.

29:33.856 --> 29:34.899
Mm.

30:16.232 --> 30:18.275
- Hey-
- Hey-

30:26.158 --> 30:28.077
I heard about
what you did out there.

30:29.286 --> 30:30.454
I'm proud of you.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.214
Sometimes the best thing
that we can do for people

30:40.422 --> 30:43.968
is just to be there for them
as a witness...

30:45.386 --> 30:46.470
when they leave.

31:00.401 --> 31:02.903
You could be a real pain
in the ass, you know that?

31:04.655 --> 31:07.032
But you could fight
like a banshee.

31:18.586 --> 31:19.712
Thank you.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.011
(HEAVY SIGH)

31:32.224 --> 31:33.642
Pope: Nice words, Professor.

31:34.768 --> 31:38.689
But as usual,
too little too late.

31:39.023 --> 31:40.065
Pope.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.991
That's all right, Dan.
Let him speak his mind.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.364
She never should have been
out there.

31:48.198 --> 31:49.398
Hell, she was dead on her feet

31:49.450 --> 31:50.743
long before that shot rang out.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.453
Man, you got half my Berserkers

31:52.786 --> 31:54.914
working on your top-secret
bubblehead project,

31:55.080 --> 31:56.165
and the other half are
on the frontlines

31:56.332 --> 31:57.625
just in case
the fishheads get hungry.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.126
There's no rest.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.295
There's no explanations.

32:02.213 --> 32:04.733
We don't even know what the hell
it is we're helping them build.

32:04.757 --> 32:05.799
Do you?

32:06.592 --> 32:08.260
You don't...
You don't care.

32:09.011 --> 32:10.137
Not really.

32:11.472 --> 32:13.192
Lee's lying in there
with a hole in her head

32:13.307 --> 32:15.809
not because of them,
because of you.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.312
Mr. President.

32:20.606 --> 32:21.690
You.

32:23.817 --> 32:24.985
You're right.

32:53.555 --> 32:54.682
Pope, is that you?

32:54.848 --> 32:56.016
It's me.

32:56.517 --> 32:57.768
I'm right here.

33:01.355 --> 33:02.523
Where's the kid?

33:03.399 --> 33:04.483
Where's Matt?

33:04.900 --> 33:06.193
He took a break.

33:06.819 --> 33:09.363
He's coming.
He's coming back.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.282
You know his name, huh?

33:14.702 --> 33:15.702
Pope?

33:16.370 --> 33:17.830
Yeah, sweetheart?

33:19.456 --> 33:24.128
When we get out of here,
take me someplace, okay?

33:26.213 --> 33:27.381
Sure.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.049
Where you want to go?

33:35.055 --> 33:36.598
Disneyland.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.978
Disneyland?
- Yeah.

33:42.438 --> 33:44.606
Yeah, we could steal a car.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.775
No, not just any car...

33:47.901 --> 33:49.069
A nice car.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.739
Just me, you, and the kid.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.451
I can't go to Disneyland, Craze.

33:56.076 --> 33:57.286
They won't let me in.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.329
Why not?

34:00.039 --> 34:02.082
I got into a fistfight
with Goofy

34:03.500 --> 34:04.500
last time I was there.

34:04.668 --> 34:07.337
- I'm banned for life.
- (GROANS)

34:08.255 --> 34:10.215
Just my luck, huh?

34:16.555 --> 34:17.723
Pope?

35:21.036 --> 35:22.412
Maggie: Hal, listen to me.

35:22.746 --> 35:24.226
People died
because of the information

35:24.331 --> 35:26.083
the mole gave Karen.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.669
The Vice President was murdered.

35:28.962 --> 35:30.083
Do you remember killing him?

35:30.087 --> 35:31.588
Do you remember
telling Karen anything

35:31.797 --> 35:33.158
that would've gotten
people killed?

35:34.883 --> 35:35.884
Does it matter?

35:36.051 --> 35:38.387
Yeah, it matters, because
she made you do those things.

35:39.346 --> 35:41.265
Whatever it is you did,
if anything,

35:41.431 --> 35:43.350
you're not responsible for.

35:45.269 --> 35:47.020
Tell that
to the people who died.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.198
Listen to me.

35:59.449 --> 36:01.785
This is treason
we're talking about, all right?

36:01.994 --> 36:02.994
Murder.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.169
Do you have any idea
what's gonna happen to you

36:05.205 --> 36:06.665
if you turn yourself in?

36:06.999 --> 36:09.960
You have any idea how amped up
people are about this?

36:10.544 --> 36:13.589
They'll hang everything on you
whether you did it or not.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.508
Not even your father's gonna
be able to save you.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.621
You better
be sure about this, Hal,

36:19.678 --> 36:21.555
before you say
anything to anybody.

36:23.599 --> 36:24.600
I'm sure.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.445
I pushed the meeting
with Adam Nye to tomorrow.

36:36.612 --> 36:37.946
Water and Power and
the Housing Authority can wait

36:38.113 --> 36:39.198
till the end of the week.

36:39.406 --> 36:41.116
And I've set the follow-ups
with the V.P. candidates

36:41.241 --> 36:42.451
- for first thing in the morning.
- No need.

36:42.576 --> 36:43.535
I've already made my decision.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.078
- Who?
- You.

36:45.454 --> 36:46.496
Me?

36:46.872 --> 36:48.112
What... I don't know
if I can...

36:48.207 --> 36:49.207
But it's not...

36:49.291 --> 36:50.626
- I'm not...
- You'll be fine.

37:06.350 --> 37:09.561
- (CLEARING THROAT)
- (MIC FEEDING BACK)

37:10.604 --> 37:12.356
President Clinton once said

37:13.190 --> 37:16.109
that there would always be
a place in our collective memory

37:16.902 --> 37:18.779
for those who've willingly given
their lives

37:18.946 --> 37:20.697
so that we could live ours.

37:26.954 --> 37:30.540
Two years ago on this day,
our lives changed forever.

37:31.875 --> 37:37.965
Many of us lost our families,
our friends, our neighbors,

37:38.131 --> 37:39.508
but as I look...

37:48.141 --> 37:50.269
The truth is as I look
around here this evening,

37:50.435 --> 37:52.229
nothing much has really changed.

37:53.814 --> 37:57.109
We're still fighting,
still losing loved ones.

37:58.110 --> 38:04.491
Still living under fear,
still searching for... hope.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.970
In fact, as I look around here
this evening,

38:06.994 --> 38:08.412
it's really hard to look
at what we've built

38:08.620 --> 38:10.372
and not compare it
to what we've lost.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.792
I lost a friend today.

38:16.086 --> 38:20.590
And her sacrifice is
an all too familiar reminder

38:20.799 --> 38:22.676
that every single day matters.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.054
Every single one of us matters.

38:27.931 --> 38:29.683
Every single one.

38:31.393 --> 38:33.770
Tonight, we will inscribe
on the leaves of this tree

38:33.979 --> 38:37.232
the names of your loved ones
who have fought and fallen,

38:38.150 --> 38:40.902
those who have died
and deserve our remembrance.

38:42.904 --> 38:44.544
And so, like my friend,
they'll live here,

38:44.656 --> 38:46.450
on the Liberty Tree, forever.

38:49.286 --> 38:51.830
And though the branches
will undoubtedly grow,

38:52.831 --> 38:54.875
because the cost of freedom
is high,

38:55.584 --> 38:59.046
this memorial means that
no matter how much time goes by,

38:59.379 --> 39:02.049
no matter how hard living gets,
we will remember.

39:02.591 --> 39:05.218
We will remember that it's not
about how long we live

39:05.927 --> 39:09.306
but how we live
and what we leave behind.

39:11.850 --> 39:16.396
And we will remember
my friend, Lee Tedeschi.

39:17.981 --> 39:20.901
And all the others
and why they fought...

39:23.987 --> 39:25.238
and why we do.
