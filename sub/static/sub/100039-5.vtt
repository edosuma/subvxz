Right? [LAUGHS]

38:59.854 --> 39:01.465
Okay, but let's do it over here.

39:01.490 --> 39:04.562
Let's do it over here, come on.

39:04.587 --> 39:05.978
- ♪ And all of the nights ♪
- All right, come on.

39:05.979 --> 39:07.513
♪ And all of the days ♪

39:07.538 --> 39:08.859
This wall. Come on!

39:08.860 --> 39:10.506
♪ We're watching them fade away ♪

39:10.531 --> 39:11.595
Whoo!

39:11.620 --> 39:13.273
BOTH: One, two, three.

39:13.274 --> 39:14.710
♪ What a life when
you're rolling the dice ♪

39:14.735 --> 39:16.041
One, two...

39:16.066 --> 39:18.273
- Three.
- Aah!

39:18.298 --> 39:22.169
♪ And all of the nights
and all of the days ♪

39:22.194 --> 39:25.023
♪ We'll be watching it fading away ♪

39:25.048 --> 39:27.494
♪ And, oh, what a life when
you're rolling the dice ♪

39:27.519 --> 39:31.497
But the truth is, even when our
brain convinces us we're lost,

39:31.522 --> 39:34.767
if we try hard enough,
our bodies always remind us

39:34.792 --> 39:36.316
there's a way back.

39:37.016 --> 39:38.419
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:38.444 --> 39:40.159
I'll be right back.

39:40.184 --> 39:42.424
♪

39:42.449 --> 39:44.215
Hey. Hey. How's she doing?

39:44.240 --> 39:45.538
She's fully recovered.

39:45.563 --> 39:47.870
She's asking for Jell-O,
so I'm on a hunt.

39:47.895 --> 39:51.111
♪ And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I'm leaving now ♪

39:51.111 --> 39:52.618
Thank you.

39:52.642 --> 39:54.253
How are you doing?

39:54.277 --> 39:57.001
I'm glad Zola's okay.

39:57.025 --> 39:59.542
Good. Nancy.

39:59.566 --> 40:01.328
"The girl who cried medical emergency."

40:01.352 --> 40:02.717
That's what the judge called you.

40:02.741 --> 40:04.685
- How's your daughter?
- Much better, thank you.

40:04.709 --> 40:07.098
She had to have neurosurgery,
so I couldn't leave her.

40:07.122 --> 40:09.073
I get that. But sadly, you're
going to have to leave her,

40:09.097 --> 40:10.415
along with the rest of your children

40:10.439 --> 40:11.908
while you make up for your missed hours.

40:11.932 --> 40:14.998
I was able to squeeze a small
drop of humanity from the judge.

40:15.022 --> 40:17.630
Thank you. I will be
at trash duty first thing,

40:17.654 --> 40:20.092
and no more excuses,
as soon as she's sent home.

40:20.116 --> 40:22.989
Dr. Grey, you're not going back
to clean-up duty.

40:23.013 --> 40:25.423
You'll be making up
your missed hours in jail.

40:25.809 --> 40:28.451
And prepares us for
whatever fight lies ahead.
