WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.135
CARLOS' NIECE ARRIVED.

00:04.135 --> 00:06.137
WE WANT YOU TO BE PART
OF THIS FAMILY,

00:06.137 --> 00:07.678
BUT YOU WILL OBEY
OUR RULES.

00:07.678 --> 00:10.441
LYNETTE AND TOM
GOT BIG NEWS.

00:10.441 --> 00:12.513
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER BABY.
 TWINS.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.446
YOU WOULD ACTUALLY SEND
YOUR WIFE TO PRISON?

00:15.446 --> 00:18.018
MY WIFE--NO.
MY EX-WIFE--YOU BET.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.790
ORSON RESORTED TO BLACKMAIL.

00:19.790 --> 00:21.792
I THINK YOU'RE
THE MOST FASCINATING WOMAN

00:21.792 --> 00:24.795
THAT I HAVE EVER MET.
 AND KARL MADE HIS MOVE.

00:24.795 --> 00:26.697
KATHERINE'S MARRIAGE TO MIKE...

00:26.697 --> 00:28.759
THAT WOMAN I WAS WITH--
TELL HER I HAD TO GO.

00:28.759 --> 00:31.102
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
 WAS PUT ON HOLD.

00:31.102 --> 00:33.104
You guys are in danger.
Get out of that car.

00:33.104 --> 00:35.136
Get away from Dave.
 (tires screech)

00:35.136 --> 00:38.269
AND WHEN THE DUST SETTLED,
WEDDING BELLS RANG

00:38.269 --> 00:40.040
FOR SOMEONE.

00:44.245 --> 00:48.449
(Mary Alice) THE VEIL WAS MADE
FROM THE FINEST SILK.

00:50.321 --> 00:54.054
THE GARTER WAS TRIMMED
WITH HANDMADE LACE.

00:56.127 --> 01:00.361
THE SHOES WERE DESIGNED
BY THE TOP COUTURIER IN MILAN.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.062
YOU SEE,

01:02.062 --> 01:06.137
THE BRIDE WANTED ONLY THE BEST
FOR HER WEDDING DAY

01:06.137 --> 01:11.342
BECAUSE SHE WAS ABOUT TO MARRY
THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD...

01:11.342 --> 01:14.305
FOR THE SECOND TIME.

01:14.305 --> 01:17.778
(sighs) HOW DO YOU FEEL?
 LIKE THE WORST PERSON
IN THE WORLD.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.780
(scoffs) DON'T DO THIS
TO YOURSELF.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.082
KATHERINE IS NEVER GONNA
FORGIVE ME FOR THIS.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.085
(organ playing in distance)
 MOM, THIS IS YOUR DAY.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.119
YOU AND MIKE WERE MEANT
TO BE TOGETHER.

01:28.119 --> 01:30.090
(chuckles) WISH ME LUCK.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.462
(both chuckle)

01:34.795 --> 01:37.868
THEN BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME,

01:37.868 --> 01:39.530
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU

01:39.530 --> 01:41.802
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.135
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

01:57.248 --> 02:01.652
(cheering)

02:01.652 --> 02:03.654
YES, THE BRIDE WANTED

02:03.654 --> 02:06.227
THE BEST WEDDING
MONEY COULD BUY.

02:06.227 --> 02:10.901
BUT AS SHE LEFT THE ALTAR,
IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HER...

02:12.903 --> 02:15.906
SORRY I'M LATE.
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

02:15.906 --> 02:33.224
SHE SHOULD'VE SPENT MORE
ON SECURITY.

02:33.224 --> 02:36.887
IT'S NOT HARD
TO FIND SIN IN THE SUBURBS.

02:36.887 --> 02:41.232
JUST LOOK BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

02:41.232 --> 02:43.234
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'LL FIND YOUR NEIGHBORS

02:43.234 --> 02:45.396
CHEATING ON THEIR TAXES...

02:47.368 --> 02:49.840
AND DRINKING TOO MUCH VODKA...

02:49.840 --> 02:54.545
AND STEALING
THEIR FATHER'S MAGAZINES.

02:54.545 --> 02:58.649
YES, THE SUBURBS ARE FILLED
WITH SINNERS,

02:58.649 --> 03:01.712
SOME OF WHO OCCASIONALLY...
REPENT.

03:01.712 --> 03:04.685
WE CAN'T DO THIS.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.916
IT'S ADULTERY.

03:05.916 --> 03:08.559
LUCKILY, WE'RE BOTH ADULTS.
 (gasps)

03:08.559 --> 03:11.191
MMM. STOP! I'M MARRIED.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.665
YES, TO A MAN
WHO'S BLACKMAILING YOU.

03:14.665 --> 03:16.667
DON'T YOU THINK MAKING LOVE
TO YOUR DIVORCE LAWYER

03:16.667 --> 03:19.300
WOULD BE A NIFTY WAY
TO GET BACK AT HIM?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.771
MMM.

03:20.771 --> 03:23.274
(squeals) OH, KARL. NO. NO!

03:23.274 --> 03:25.576
NO.
 (sighs) WHAT NOW?

03:25.576 --> 03:27.578
IF I'M GONNA
BREAK A COMMANDMENT,

03:27.578 --> 03:29.580
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE
FOR A QUICKIE ON THIS COUCH.

03:29.580 --> 03:32.583
WHO SAID QUICKIE? I'VE GOT
40 MINUTES BEFORE MY 10:00.

03:32.583 --> 03:36.947
AND THOU SHALT GET SWEATY.
 I WANNA DO THIS. I DO.
BUT NOT HERE.

03:36.947 --> 03:38.949
I NEED TO FEEL SPECIAL.

03:38.949 --> 03:40.921
BUT YOU ARE SPECIAL.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.593
ARE YOU SAYING

03:42.593 --> 03:45.426
YOU'VE NEVER MADE LOVE
TO ANOTHER WOMAN ON THIS COUCH?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.628
NOT A SPECIAL WOMAN.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.929
OKAY.
 ALL RIGHT.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.931
I GET IT. I GET IT.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.504
I WANT THIS TO BE NICE FOR YOU.
I'LL FIND US A HOTEL.

03:53.504 --> 03:56.006
CALL ME LATER WHEN YOU'VE
SET SOMETHING UP.

03:56.006 --> 03:57.007
DONE.

03:57.007 --> 03:58.439
AHEM.

03:58.439 --> 04:01.972
AND JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,
THIS VISIT WAS NOT BILLABLE.

04:03.814 --> 04:07.478
MORNING. I'M LATE FOR SCHOOL.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR BREAKFAST.

04:07.478 --> 04:09.480
AT LEAST TAKE A MUFFIN.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.622
THANK YOU, UNCLE CARLOS.

04:11.622 --> 04:14.685
KIND OF WARM FOR A SWEATSHIRT,
ISN'T IT?

04:14.685 --> 04:17.458
OH, IT GETS REALLY COLD
IN THE CLASSROOM.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.290
MM. STOP.

04:20.930 --> 04:23.964
LIFT IT UP.
 (scoffs) GABY.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.966
GIRLS WHO SPEND AN HOUR
ON MAKEUP

04:25.966 --> 04:29.340
DO NOT WEAR BAGGY SWEATSHIRTS.
LIFT IT.

04:29.340 --> 04:31.001
(sighs)

04:32.673 --> 04:36.006
WELL, THAT OUGHTA
HEAT UP THE CLASSROOM.

04:36.006 --> 04:39.380
GO AND CHANGE.
 GABY, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.552
ALL THE GIRLS IN MY CLASS
DRESS LIKE THIS.

04:41.552 --> 04:43.814
THAT'S WHY YOUR SCHOOL NURSE
IS AN OBSTETRICIAN.

04:43.814 --> 04:46.917
WEAR SOMETHING ELSE.
 FINE. I'LL BORROW
ONE OF YOUR TOPS.

04:48.359 --> 04:50.060
IT MIGHT BE EXCITING

04:50.060 --> 04:52.062
FOR IT TO GO SOMEPLACE
BESIDES THE SUPERMARKET.

04:52.062 --> 04:53.424
(door slams)

04:53.424 --> 04:55.966
OH, SNAP!

04:55.966 --> 04:57.998
HEY, YOU I CAN HIT.

05:00.070 --> 05:01.702
(exhales deeply)

05:01.702 --> 05:04.435
DO YOU SEE
WHAT I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH?

05:04.435 --> 05:07.077
IT WAS JUST A SHIRT.
 YEAH?

05:07.077 --> 05:09.810
AND WHEN SHE CAME HOME PAST
CURFEW, IT WAS JUST 40 MINUTES.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.543
AND WHEN SHE TOOK MONEY
FROM MY PURSE, IT WAS JUST $5.

05:12.543 --> 05:16.547
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
MAKE EXCUSES FOR HER?
 SHE'S HAD A SAD LIFE.

05:16.547 --> 05:18.619
HER MOM'S IN JAIL.
HER DAD WALKED OUT.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.951
YEAH, YEAH, SHE'S ONE DEAD DOG
AWAY FROM A COUNTRY SONG.

05:20.951 --> 05:22.953
I DON'T CARE.
 WELL... (sighs)

05:22.953 --> 05:24.955
MAYBE SHE WOULD CALM DOWN

05:24.955 --> 05:28.028
IF SHE FELT
A LITTLE MORE SECURE HERE.
 I'M NOT SIGNING THOSE PAPERS.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.732
WE NEED TO BE
HER LEGAL GUARDIANS.
 AND LOOK AFTER HER
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS? NO.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.064
UNTIL I SEE A CHANGE
IN HER BEHAVIOR,

05:34.064 --> 05:36.437
I'M KEEPING
ALL MY OPTIONS OPEN.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.939
IS THIS BETTER?

05:38.939 --> 05:41.512
YES. VERY NICE.
THANK YOU.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.746
STOP.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.968
MMM. WHAT DO I SMELL?

06:07.968 --> 06:12.473
DESPAIR. MORTALITY.
PARALYZING FEAR.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.045
OH. I THOUGHT
IT WAS WAFFLES.

06:15.045 --> 06:18.048
DO YOU REALIZE THAT WHEN
 THESE TWINS FINISH HIGH SCHOOL,

06:18.048 --> 06:20.050
I'LL BE IN MY 60s?

06:20.050 --> 06:21.912
NO.

06:21.912 --> 06:24.755
NO, YOU'LL BE
IN YOUR, UH...

06:24.755 --> 06:26.086
HUH.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.758
AT THEIR GRADUATION,

06:27.758 --> 06:30.821
I WILL BE THE CRAZY OLD LADY
WITH OATMEAL ON HER CHIN.

06:30.821 --> 06:32.823
LOOK, I KNOW
THIS WASN'T PLANNED,

06:32.823 --> 06:34.825
BUT WE--WE CAN DO THIS.

06:34.825 --> 06:38.168
I MEAN, WE HAD A LOT OF FUN
RAISING THE FIRST FOUR KIDS.

06:38.168 --> 06:41.171
BUT WE WERE DONE, TOM.
WE WERE ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.

06:41.171 --> 06:43.133
NO MORE DIAPERS.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.476
NO MORE STRAINED CARROTS.

06:45.476 --> 06:48.178
NO MORE READING
STUPID "GOODNIGHT, MOON"!
 LYNETTE--

06:48.178 --> 06:50.180
AND WITH PRESTON
GOING TO EUROPE,

06:50.180 --> 06:52.182
WE EVEN HAD
ONE MOVING OUT!

06:52.182 --> 06:54.184
WE WILL NEVER BE DONE

06:54.184 --> 06:57.818
IF WE BIRTH TWO
EVERY TIME ONE MOVES OUT!

06:57.818 --> 07:00.190
THAT'S JUST MATH!

07:01.992 --> 07:04.825
EIGHT AND HALF MONTHS TO GO.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.497
YAY.

07:11.962 --> 07:14.465
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

07:14.465 --> 07:16.436
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.939
I WAS NEVER ABLE
TO PICTURE US OLD TOGETHER,

07:18.939 --> 07:22.042
SITTING ON THE PORCH,
GRAY HAIR.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.844
I TRIED,

07:23.844 --> 07:25.846
BUT I COULD NEVER SEE IT.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.448
(sighs) I'M SORRY.

07:31.021 --> 07:33.754
OH, KATHERINE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
 MIKE, PLEASE.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.056
I DON'T NEED
ANOTHER REMINDER OF YOU.

07:44.034 --> 07:45.566
(sighs)

07:45.566 --> 07:48.669
SO... HOW'D IT GO?
HOW WAS SHE?

07:48.669 --> 07:51.101
SHE WAS... OKAY.

07:51.101 --> 07:53.103
"OKAY"? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

07:53.103 --> 07:55.105
I MEAN, DID YOU TELL HER
EVERYTHING?

07:55.105 --> 07:57.107
DID YOU TELL HER
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED?

07:57.107 --> 07:59.950
YEAH. I THINK SHE'S TRYING
TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD.

07:59.950 --> 08:03.013
THE HIGH ROAD? UM, AS IN,
"I WISH YOU AND SUSAN THE BEST"?

08:03.013 --> 08:06.016
OR THE HIGH ROAD AS IN,
"WHEN I CUT SUSAN'S BRAKE LINE,

08:06.016 --> 08:08.519
SHE'LL CAREEN
OFF THE HIGH ROAD"?

08:08.519 --> 08:12.222
WELL, SHE KNOWS IT'S OVER,
AND SHE'S DEALING WITH IT.

08:12.222 --> 08:16.166
(sighs) MM, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY HARD FOR YOU.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.028
YEAH, IT WAS.
 MM.

08:18.028 --> 08:21.832
BUT NOW THAT SHE KNOWS, IT'LL BE
EASIER WHEN YOU TALK TO HER.

08:21.832 --> 08:24.004
ME TALK TO HER?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.676
UH, WHY? WHY? WHY?

08:25.676 --> 08:28.008
I--YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WAS DATING HER,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.911
I'M--I JUST...
(chuckles nervously) I DON'T...

08:30.911 --> 08:32.913
I THINK WE'RE GOOD NOW.

08:32.913 --> 08:36.717
HONEY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DEAL WITH HER AT SOME POINT.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.989
FINE. YES, I WILL. I WILL.

08:38.989 --> 08:42.052
UM, JUST, UH, NOT TODAY,
'CAUSE TODAY JULIE'S COMING HOME

08:42.052 --> 08:44.695
AND, UH... YOU KNOW,
I WANNA GET HER SETTLED IN.

08:44.695 --> 08:46.526
SO... WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.528
OOH, THAT'S NOT GOOD EITHER,

08:48.528 --> 08:51.201
'CAUSE JULIE AND I ARE GONNA
PICK OUT MY WEDDING DRESS.

08:51.201 --> 08:53.203
YOU LIVE RIGHT
ACROSS THE STREET FROM HER.

08:53.203 --> 08:55.836
YOU CAN'T AVOID HER
FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.137
WELL, NOT 50.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.110
(chuckles) JUST TILL
SHE'S TOO OLD TO THROW THINGS.

09:00.110 --> 09:02.643
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.974
(sighs)

09:03.974 --> 09:07.077
I THINK KATHERINE'S
REALLY GONNA SURPRISE YOU.

09:14.124 --> 09:16.126
(sighs)

09:25.095 --> 09:28.098
ALL OF THE WINDOWS ARE
TRIPLE PANE ENERGY EFFICIENT.

09:28.098 --> 09:30.240
OH, AND I SHOULD MENTION
THE HARDWOOD FLOORS WERE

09:30.240 --> 09:32.242
COMPLETELY REDONE RECENTLY.
BLACK WALNUT.

09:32.242 --> 09:34.775
IT'S NICE.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.278
SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME?

09:38.278 --> 09:41.852
NAH, I THINK YOU PRETTY MUCH
GOT IT COVERED.

09:41.852 --> 09:44.755
REALLY? CHECK ME OUT!
(chuckles)

09:44.755 --> 09:48.088
I'M--I'M NEW AT THIS. I JUST GOT
MY BROKER'S LICENSE LAST WEEK.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.621
CONGRATULATIONS.

09:50.621 --> 09:52.623
IT'S A PRETTY NICE HOUSE
FOR YOUR FIRST LISTING.

09:52.623 --> 09:54.625
I GOT REALLY LUCKY.
THE WOMAN WHO HANDLED

09:54.625 --> 09:56.627
THE PROPERTIES
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD--

09:56.627 --> 09:59.770
SHE SLAMMED HER CAR INTO A POLE
AND GOT FRIED BY A POWER LINE.

09:59.770 --> 10:02.332
LIKE I SAID, CONGRATS.

10:02.332 --> 10:04.835
UH, MRS. BOLEN'S
BEEN AWFULLY QUIET.

10:04.835 --> 10:09.109
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 ME? I'M THINKIN'
YOU'RE FULL OF CRAP.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.610
I'M SORRY?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.612
WELL, THE FACT THAT
WE CAN AFFORD THIS PLACE

10:12.612 --> 10:14.614
SAYS TO ME
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH IT.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.116
SO, UH, START TALKIN'.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.318
MOLD? TERMITES? LEAKY ROOF?

10:18.318 --> 10:22.122
HONESTLY, I HAVE TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.855
SURE, YOU COULD PLAY IT
LIKE THAT.

10:24.855 --> 10:29.199
BUT IF WE DO BUY THIS PLACE
AND IT TURNS INTO A MONEY PIT,

10:29.199 --> 10:32.202
I'M GONNA NEED TO
TAKE MY ANGER OUT ON SOMEONE.

10:32.202 --> 10:35.105
LIKE MAYBE THE REALTOR
WHO MADE A BIG DEAL

10:35.105 --> 10:38.108
OUT OF TELLING US HE LIVES
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET?

10:38.108 --> 10:40.110
OKAY, WELL, I DON'T KNOW

10:40.110 --> 10:43.043
THAT THIS IS
ACTUALLY CONSIDERED A FLAW,

10:43.043 --> 10:47.047
BUT A WHILE AGO, UH,
THE LADY WHO WAS LIVING HERE--

10:47.047 --> 10:50.050
SHE WAS APPARENTLY GOING
THROUGH KIND OF A TOUGH TIME,

10:50.050 --> 10:52.883
AND LONG STORY SHORT,
SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE.

10:55.686 --> 10:58.088
SHOT HERSELF...

10:58.088 --> 11:00.360
IN--IN THE HEAD.

11:02.192 --> 11:05.035
IN THIS ROOM.

11:05.035 --> 11:06.166
THAT'S IT?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.738
WELL, YEAH.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.372
WE'LL TAKE IT.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.145
REALLY? OH, THAT IS SO...
THAT IS--

11:15.145 --> 11:17.447
OKAY, I'LL JUST--I'LL JUST
GET THE PAPERWORK.

11:25.155 --> 11:27.057
IT'S A NICE PLACE.

11:27.057 --> 11:29.359
I THINK WE COULD
BE HAPPY HERE.

11:29.359 --> 11:32.362
RIGHT, DANNY?

11:32.362 --> 11:35.065
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME?

11:35.065 --> 11:38.198
I DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE HERE.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.000
OH, HONEY.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.132
WHOSE FAULT WAS THAT?

11:45.075 --> 11:49.039
JULIE! LOOK AT YOU!

11:49.039 --> 11:51.141
(speaking indistinctly)

12:04.955 --> 12:08.328
OH, ANGIE,
THESE ARE INCREDIBLE.
 (mouth full)
WHAT DO YOU CALL 'EM AGAIN?

12:08.328 --> 12:11.031
PIZZELLES. COME ON, EAT UP.
I MADE SIX DOZEN.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.163
MY GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPES
WERE ALWAYS FOR 30 PEOPLE.

12:13.163 --> 12:15.766
TRUST ME, SHE'D FATTEN
YOU FOUR UP IN A WEEK.

12:15.766 --> 12:18.468
THESE GO
STRAIGHT TO YOUR ASS.
 (women chuckle)

12:18.468 --> 12:20.070
HMM.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.773
OKAY. I'M SORRY.
DO YOU GUYS NOT SAY "ASS"?

12:22.773 --> 12:24.144
SURE, WE DO.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.146
COME ON, BREE. SHOW HER.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.849
SO, UH, SUSAN TELLS ME

12:28.849 --> 12:31.181
THAT YOUR SON
IS ABOUT TO START COLLEGE.

12:31.181 --> 12:33.353
MM-HMM. WE'RE JUST DEALING
WITH SOME PAPERWORK,

12:33.353 --> 12:35.425
BUT HE SHOULD BE STARTIN'
SOMETIME NEXT WEEK.

12:35.425 --> 12:37.427
OH, I THOUGHT HE WAS
ALREADY IN CLASS.

12:37.427 --> 12:40.460
UH, HE ASKED JULIE
TO TUTOR HIM IN MATH.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.962
REALLY?

12:41.962 --> 12:43.533
(doorbell rings)
 OH, THAT MUST BE KATHERINE.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.165
I'LL GET IT.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.298
KATHERINE? Y-YOU DIDN'T SAY
KATHERINE WAS COMING.

12:48.298 --> 12:50.300
SHE'S JUST DROPPING
SOMETHING OFF.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.373
WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU'VE SEEN
HER SINCE THIS MIKE THING.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.176
(voice raises)
OH, YEAH... SORTA.
 YOUR VOICE JUST GOT VERY HIGH.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.148
YOU HAVE TALKED TO HER,
HAVEN'T YOU?

12:58.148 --> 13:01.011
(normal voice) I'M...
(sighs) GOING TO.

13:01.011 --> 13:03.313
I'VE JUST BEEN SO BUSY
WITH ALL THE WEDDING PLANS.

13:03.313 --> 13:06.256
YEAH, I WOULDN'T OPEN
WITH THAT.

13:06.256 --> 13:07.357
HI.

13:07.357 --> 13:09.359
I'M JUST
DROPPING OFF THE MENU

13:09.359 --> 13:11.791
FOR THE DAVENPORT
ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.095
YOU FINISHED THAT? ALREADY?
IT'S THREE MONTHS AWAY.

13:15.095 --> 13:18.098
WELL, I HAVE A LOT OF FREE TIME
ON MY HANDS THESE DAYS.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.799
HELLO, SUSAN.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.102
OH!

13:22.102 --> 13:24.474
(chuckles nervously)
HI, KATHERINE.

13:24.474 --> 13:26.476
HOW--HOW ARE YOU DOING?

13:28.438 --> 13:32.112
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN A WHILE.
 WELL, I'VE BEEN...

13:32.112 --> 13:35.145
USING THE BACK DOOR A LOT MORE
LATELY. (chuckles nervously)

13:36.546 --> 13:38.919
KATHERINE, YOUR BUTTONS...

13:38.919 --> 13:40.250
OH!

13:40.250 --> 13:42.252
(laughing)

13:42.252 --> 13:45.825
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE MY HEAD IS ANYMORE.

13:53.203 --> 13:55.265
(door closes)

13:55.265 --> 13:58.208
WHOA. WAS IT JUST ME OR WAS THAT
THE MOST AWKWARD MOMENT EVER?

13:58.208 --> 14:00.510
YOU BET YOUR SWEET ASS
IT WAS.

14:06.216 --> 14:09.149
HON, COULD YOU GET ME
A GLASS OF WATER, PLEASE?

14:09.149 --> 14:10.951
YOU GOT IT.
 THANKS.

14:12.482 --> 14:14.184
(woman laughs)

14:15.625 --> 14:19.159
IT'S OUR FIRST.
 YEAH, I GOT THAT.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.330
HOW ABOUT YOU?

14:20.330 --> 14:23.333
FOUR AT HOME,
TWO ON THE WAY.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.496
OH, BIG FAMILY.
YOU'RE SO BLESSED.

14:26.496 --> 14:28.138
(forced chuckle)

14:28.138 --> 14:31.902
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING
BETTER THAN BEING A MOMMY.

14:33.543 --> 14:35.075
REALLY?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.377
I MEAN, I KNOW
IT'S A LOT OF WORK,

14:37.377 --> 14:40.510
BUT LUCKILY MY HUSBAND
PLANS TO BE REALLY HANDS-ON.

14:40.510 --> 14:43.483
YEAH.
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.285
PARDON?

14:45.285 --> 14:47.287
OH, HE'LL BE THERE AT FIRST,

14:47.287 --> 14:49.289
MAYBE EVEN
CHANGE A DIAPER OR TWO

14:49.289 --> 14:51.992
UNTIL THE NOVELTY WEARS OFF.
BUT THOSE 4:00 A.M. FEEDINGS

14:51.992 --> 14:54.124
HE SAID HE'D HELP OUT WITH?
FORGET IT.

14:54.124 --> 14:57.067
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW MY JOHNNY.
HE'S DIFFERENT.

14:57.067 --> 14:58.969
DOES HE HAVE BOOBS?

14:58.969 --> 15:00.500
NO.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.203
THEN YOU'RE
THE ONLY BAR IN TOWN.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.205
THAT BABY CAN
SCREAM INTO A BULLHORN,

15:05.205 --> 15:07.037
AND JOHNNY WON'T BUDGE.

15:07.037 --> 15:10.180
O-OKAY.

15:10.180 --> 15:12.242
THANKS.

15:12.242 --> 15:14.184
I'M NOT DONE.

15:14.184 --> 15:16.046
YOU SEE THIS?

15:16.046 --> 15:18.048
YOU'LL NEVER
WEAR A BIKINI AGAIN.

15:18.048 --> 15:21.251
BUT YOU'VE HAD FOUR KIDS,
AND YOU LOOK GOOD.

15:21.251 --> 15:23.253
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME NAKED.

15:23.253 --> 15:25.625
YOU MEAN STOMACH LOOKS LIKE
SPANISH STUCCO.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.297
AND MY BREASTS RESEMBLE

15:27.297 --> 15:29.299
TWO BALLOONS
YOU'D FIND BEHIND THE COUCH

15:29.299 --> 15:31.301
A WEEK AFTER THE PARTY.

15:31.301 --> 15:33.303
YOU KNOW, MOST WOMEN SAY

15:33.303 --> 15:36.006
THIS IS THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE
OF THEIR LIFE.

15:36.006 --> 15:37.407
MOST WOMEN ARE LIARS.

15:37.407 --> 15:39.939
MY MOTHER WAS LIAR,
AND HER MOTHER WAS A LIAR,

15:39.939 --> 15:41.941
AND YOUR MOTHER IS A LIAR.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.974
IT'S A LIE EVERY GENERATION
TELLS THE NEXT

15:43.974 --> 15:46.516
SO THEY CAN GET GRANDCHILDREN.
 PLEASE STOP TALKING TO ME.

15:46.516 --> 15:49.519
NO, YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS.
YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED.

15:49.519 --> 15:52.522
YOUR CHILDREN WILL HIT YOU
AND STEAL FROM YOUR PURSE.

15:52.522 --> 15:55.525
YOUR HUSBAND WILL BEGIN
TO BUY YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENTS

15:55.525 --> 15:57.227
AT THE CAR WASH.

15:57.227 --> 15:59.529
AND THE KICKER--
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

15:59.529 --> 16:02.592
THERE WILL BE SO MANY MOMENTS
WHEN YOU FEEL LONELY,

16:02.592 --> 16:06.136
BUT YOU WILL NEVER BE ALONE.

16:08.538 --> 16:10.540
THEY WERE OUT OF WATER.

16:10.540 --> 16:13.343
IS JUICE OKAY?

16:13.343 --> 16:16.206
(crying)

16:18.248 --> 16:21.611
HORMONES. GET USED TO IT.

16:21.611 --> 16:25.285
(Karl) I CANNOT BELIEVE
WE ARE FINALLY GOING TO DO THIS.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.288
YOU'RE NOT AN EASY WOMAN
TO PIN DOWN,

16:28.288 --> 16:32.322
BUT I SURE AM
GOING TO ENJOY TRYING.

16:32.322 --> 16:33.623
(laughs)

16:36.696 --> 16:37.767
WHAT?

16:37.767 --> 16:40.170
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

16:40.170 --> 16:44.074
HEY, I THINK I LOOK PRETTY GOOD
FOR MY AGE.

16:44.074 --> 16:46.376
NOT YOU, KARL. THE ROOM.

16:46.376 --> 16:49.079
IT'S FILTHY AND HIDEOUS.

16:49.079 --> 16:51.381
WELL, I TOOK YOU
TO A NICE HOTEL LAST WEEK,

16:51.381 --> 16:53.713
AND WE HAD TO LEAVE
'CAUSE YOU SAW SOMEONE YOU KNEW.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.716
WHO WE GONNA RUN INTO HERE?
 WELL, CERTAINLY NOT
A CLEANING LADY.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.389
OKAY, SO IT'S A LITTLE DUSTY.
BUT TRUST ME,

16:59.389 --> 17:02.292
ONCE I GET STARTED,
YOU'LL NEVER EVEN NOTICE.

17:02.292 --> 17:05.325
MY GOD, THOSE SHEETS!
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM?

17:05.325 --> 17:09.259
THEY'RE DISCOLORED, THREADBARE
AND REEK OF INDUSTRIAL BLEACH.

17:09.259 --> 17:12.061
YOU GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES,
THEY'LL REEK OF US.

17:12.061 --> 17:14.364
KARL, I'M NOT GONNA LIE
ON THAT REVOLTING SHEET,

17:14.364 --> 17:17.137
WONDERING HOW MANY JUNKIES
HAVE DIED ON IT.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.269
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO ABOUT IT?

17:20.640 --> 17:23.213
OOH, EGYPTIAN COTTON!

17:23.213 --> 17:26.546
THESE ARE PRETTY, AREN'T THEY?
 GREAT. LOVE 'EM. LET'S GO.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.549
IT DOESN'T HELP WHEN YOU SAY
THAT ABOUT EVERY SINGLE SET.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.551
BREE, AN HOUR AGO,
I WAS HALF-NAKED.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.554
NOW I'M SHEET SHOPPING.
FORGIVE ME IF I'M AN EASY SELL.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.357
I'M JUST NOT SURE THIS COLOR
WILL MATCH THE CARPET.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.359
WELL, GET 'EM IN BLUE.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.361
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
THEY'LL MATCH THEN.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.233
FINE. I'LL TAKE THESE.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.195
NOW WE JUST NEED TO STOP
FOR SOME FLOWERS.

17:45.195 --> 17:46.466
FLOWERS?

17:46.466 --> 17:49.269
I JUST WANT THIS AFFAIR
TO BE NICE.

17:51.271 --> 17:54.374
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT
THIS AFFAIR TO BE NICE.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.376
YOU DON'T WANT IT AT ALL.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.778
DON'T BE SILLY.
OF COURSE I DO.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.211
YOU MAY THINK YOU DO,

18:01.211 --> 18:03.213
BUT I'VE BEEN CHASING YOU
FOR TWO WEEKS,

18:03.213 --> 18:05.215
AND YOU'VE DOWN NOTHING
BUT THROW UP ROADBLOCKS.

18:05.215 --> 18:09.759
"NOT TONIGHT." "NOT THIS HOTEL."
"NOT THOSE SHEETS."

18:09.759 --> 18:13.193
KARL, IF YOU THINK I'VE BEEN
LEADING YOU ON, YOU'RE WRONG.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.566
BREE, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S JUST WHO YOU ARE.

18:16.566 --> 18:18.568
YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL
WHO NEVER BREAKS THE RULES

18:18.568 --> 18:21.501
NO MATTER HOW MISERABLE
IT MAKES HER.

18:21.501 --> 18:24.504
I THOUGHT A LITTLE KARL TIME
MIGHT BRIGHTEN YOUR DAY.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.506
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH
I CAN DO FOR SOMEONE

18:26.506 --> 18:28.778
WHO WOULD RATHER BE GOOD
THAN HAPPY.

18:36.546 --> 18:39.389
(doorbell rings)

18:39.389 --> 18:41.391
CAN I HELP YOU?

18:41.391 --> 18:43.523
I'VE GOT A DELIVERY
FOR SUSAN MAYER,

18:43.523 --> 18:47.227
BUT SHE'S NOT HOME.
DO YOU MIND SIGNING FOR HER?

18:47.227 --> 18:51.201
OH. THAT MUST BE HER GOWN.

18:51.201 --> 18:53.233
OF COURSE I'LL TAKE IT.

18:53.233 --> 18:56.236
WE DO THINGS LIKE THIS
FOR EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.168
IN FACT, JUST LAST MONTH,

18:58.168 --> 19:00.170
SHE TOOK IN
SOMETHING OF MINE.

19:11.781 --> 19:13.783
(sighs)

19:18.428 --> 19:20.260
OH, GOD.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.892
OH, GOD. OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

19:27.837 --> 19:30.700
UM, KATHERINE, IT'S ME.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.703
I-I'VE JUST COME OVER
TO PICK UP MY...

19:37.307 --> 19:38.708
HELLO, SUSAN.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.451
OKAY, I DID NOT
SEE THAT COMING.

19:41.451 --> 19:43.553
IT'S JUST SO BEAUTIFUL.

19:43.553 --> 19:45.555
I COULDN'T RESIST.

19:45.555 --> 19:48.388
WELL...

19:48.388 --> 19:51.621
THANK YOU FOR TAKING
SUCH GOOD CARE OF IT.

19:51.621 --> 19:53.793
(chuckles)

19:53.793 --> 19:55.795
BUT I SHOULD
PROBABLY GO NOW,

19:55.795 --> 19:59.599
SO IF YOU JUST WANNA
SLIP IT OFF AND...

19:59.599 --> 20:02.732
OH, WAIT.
I HAVE TO CHECK ON MY SAUCE.

20:04.534 --> 20:06.376
SAUCE?

20:06.376 --> 20:08.408
(bubbling)

20:08.408 --> 20:09.539
MMM!

20:09.539 --> 20:12.282
DOESN'T THAT SMELL GOOD?

20:12.282 --> 20:13.943
IT SMELLS DONE.

20:13.943 --> 20:15.885
(bubbling continues)

20:15.885 --> 20:19.249
WHY DON'T YOU STEP AWAY
FROM THE POT?

20:19.249 --> 20:21.691
OH, NO. THE SECRET IS
YOU HAVE TO KEEP STIRRING.

20:25.355 --> 20:26.626
YOU KNOW,

20:26.626 --> 20:28.998
I REALLY LOVE THIS FABRIC.

20:28.998 --> 20:30.660
IT FEELS SO EXPENSIVE.

20:30.660 --> 20:33.403
IT IS.

20:33.403 --> 20:35.705
THAT'S WHY
THEY HAD IT ALL PROTECTED

20:35.705 --> 20:39.569
WITH THAT ACID-FREE TISSUE PAPER
AND PLASTIC GARMENT BAG.

20:39.569 --> 20:41.441
HUH.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.373
MAYBE...

20:43.373 --> 20:46.576
I SHOULD GIVE YOU SOME
OF THIS SAUCE TO TAKE TO MIKE.

20:46.576 --> 20:48.448
(bubbling continues)

20:48.448 --> 20:50.780
HE USED TO LOVE MY SAUCE.

20:50.780 --> 20:52.582
OF COURSE,

20:52.582 --> 20:54.584
HE USED TO LOVE ME, TOO.

20:57.857 --> 21:02.362
OKAY, ENOUGH WITH THE SAUCE.
I WANT MY DRESS BACK NOW.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.802
OF COURSE. I'M SORRY.
CAN YOU PLEASE UNZIP ME?

21:12.802 --> 21:14.304
MM.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.307
(sighs)

21:20.510 --> 21:23.012
IT REALLY IS
A BEAUTIFUL DRESS.

21:24.814 --> 21:28.558
KATHERINE WAS ACTUALLY
 WEARING THE DRESS?

21:28.558 --> 21:31.791
YES! STOP BLOCKING MY LIGHT.
KEEP BLOTTING.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.823
UGH! MOM, RELAX.
WE GOT ALL THE SAUCE.

21:33.823 --> 21:36.826
NO, I STILL SEE FLECKS OF RED.
 IT'S YOUR THIRD WEDDING.

21:36.826 --> 21:38.828
AN ALL-WHITE DRESS
IS GONNA BE A STRETCH ANYWAY.

21:38.828 --> 21:40.500
DO ME A FAVOR.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.002
SAVE THE "MY MOM'S A SLUT" JOKES
FOR THE TOAST.

21:43.002 --> 21:46.436
YOU THINK I SHOULD
GO TALK TO HER AGAIN?
 WHAT? WHY?

21:46.436 --> 21:48.878
WELL, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY HURTING
MORE THAN I THOUGHT.

21:48.878 --> 21:50.880
EXCUSE ME,
SHE KIDNAPPED MY WEDDING DRESS

21:50.880 --> 21:53.082
AND HELD A POT OF SAUCE
TO ITS HEAD!

21:53.082 --> 21:55.815
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
DEFEND HER?

21:55.815 --> 21:58.888
I'M NOT DEFENDING HER. I'M JUST
A LITTLE CONCERNED. AREN'T YOU?

21:58.888 --> 22:01.721
NO! I MEAN...
(sighs) YES, I WAS.

22:01.721 --> 22:05.094
BUT AT THIS POINT,
I'M A LITTLE SICK OF HER.

22:05.094 --> 22:08.097
DO YOU KNOW THAT WHEN I TOLD
PEOPLE THAT I'M GETTING MARRIED,

22:08.097 --> 22:09.959
NO ONE SAYS CONGRATULATIONS.

22:09.959 --> 22:12.462
THEY ALL SAY, "OH, MY GOD.
IS KATHERINE OKAY?

22:12.462 --> 22:13.963
HOW'S KATHERINE?"

22:13.963 --> 22:16.966
DOES NO ONE REMEMBER
THAT YOU WERE WITH ME FIRST?

22:16.966 --> 22:19.369
SHE STOLE MY LEFTOVERS.
DOES NOBODY REMEMBER THAT?

22:19.369 --> 22:21.511
DID SHE JUST REFER TO ME
AS LEFTOVERS?

22:21.511 --> 22:24.113
MY POINT IS THAT I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

22:24.113 --> 22:26.876
YOU AND I HAVE A CHILD,

22:26.876 --> 22:30.420
AND I AM JUST TIRED
OF FEELING LIKE THE OTHER WOMAN.

22:33.022 --> 22:36.025
SCARY PART IS, OF THE TWO WOMEN
YOU COULD MARRY,

22:36.025 --> 22:39.358
THAT'S THE STABLE ONE.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.661
THANKS FOR TAKING ME
TO THE STORE.

22:41.661 --> 22:44.794
I PROMISED ROY
I'D MAKE HIM MEATLOAF.
 OH, I THINK IT'S SWEET

22:44.794 --> 22:48.137
THAT YOU FOUND A MALE COMPANION
AT THIS STAGE IN YOUR LIFE.

22:48.137 --> 22:51.401
ROY'S NO COMPANION.
THE MAN HAS SEEN PARIS.

22:53.102 --> 22:55.605
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M BACK IN THE SADDLE.

22:55.605 --> 22:58.107
IT STARTED ONE NIGHT
WHEN ROY ASKED

22:58.107 --> 23:00.650
IF MY BATHTUB
WAS BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO--

23:00.650 --> 23:03.653
HEY! YOU WANT ME TO CRASH
THE CAR? 'CAUSE I WILL.

23:07.917 --> 23:10.720
(car engine turns off)

23:10.720 --> 23:12.422
HEY, AUNT GABY.

23:12.422 --> 23:14.063
NEED YOUR CAR WASHED?

23:14.063 --> 23:16.526
OH! I'M AUNT GABY NOW?

23:16.526 --> 23:18.868
LET ME GUESS.
YOU WANT SOMETHING.

23:18.868 --> 23:21.170
WELL, THERE IS A PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT...

23:21.170 --> 23:22.702
REALLY?!

23:27.477 --> 23:29.138
OKAY, YOU CAN GO.

23:29.138 --> 23:31.481
SERIOUSLY?

23:31.481 --> 23:34.413
WELL, IF YOU CAN MAKE
AN EFFORT AROUND HERE,

23:34.413 --> 23:38.047
THEN I GUESS I CAN, TOO.
JUST BE HOME BY 10:00.

23:38.047 --> 23:40.890
YEAH, THAT'S THE THING.

23:40.890 --> 23:43.923
THE PARTY DOESN'T START
TILL 11:00.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.596
WHAT KIND OF PARTY
STARTS AT 11:00?

23:46.596 --> 23:48.598
THIS NEW DANCE CLUB
IS OPENING DOWNTOWN,

23:48.598 --> 23:51.200
AND IT IS, LIKE,
 THE HOTTEST THING EVER.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.634
EVERYBODY'S GOING.
 NOT EVERYBODY.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.936
IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT,
AND YOU KNOW THE RULES.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.138
BUT THANK YOU
FOR WASHING THE CAR.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.071
(grunts)

24:05.014 --> 24:07.016
WELL,
SHE'S QUITE THE CHARMER.

24:07.016 --> 24:09.018
DO YOU SEE
WHAT I'M DEALING WITH?
 (door closes)

24:09.018 --> 24:12.021
I MEAN, CARLOS AND I BASICALLY
TOOK HER OFF THE STREET.

24:12.021 --> 24:15.024
YOU'D THINK SHE'D BE GRATEFUL.
BUT EVERY DAY IS A BATTLE.

24:15.024 --> 24:17.026
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GET THROUGH TO HER.

24:17.026 --> 24:19.529
TEENAGE GIRLS--THEY'RE THE BEST
REASON FOR NOT HAVING KIDS.

24:19.529 --> 24:21.531
THANK GOD
ROY HAD A VASECTOMY.

24:24.163 --> 24:27.997
SO BASED ON THE DATA GIVEN
FOR THIS POPULATION,

24:27.997 --> 24:30.069
AND USING
THE STANDARD DEVIATION FORMULA,

24:30.069 --> 24:32.702
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS VARIABLE IS?

24:32.702 --> 24:36.205
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO A MOVIE SOMETIME?

24:36.205 --> 24:37.176
(chuckles)

24:39.108 --> 24:42.111
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WOULD
BE A DATE OR ANYTHING.

24:42.111 --> 24:44.684
WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

24:44.684 --> 24:46.716
FRIENDS GO TO MOVIES
ALL THE TIME.

24:46.716 --> 24:49.519
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THAT.

24:49.519 --> 24:50.990
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.622
(chuckles)

24:52.622 --> 24:55.965
I DID KNOW THAT.

24:55.965 --> 24:57.827
OKAY.

24:57.827 --> 24:58.968
REALLY?

25:00.229 --> 25:02.101
THAT'S GREAT. (chuckles)

25:02.101 --> 25:05.204
HEY, JULIE.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

25:05.204 --> 25:08.207
DANNY, DO ME A FAVOR AND TAKE
THE TRASH OUT, WILL YA?

25:08.207 --> 25:11.180
UH... CAN I DO IT
A LITTLE LATER?

25:11.180 --> 25:13.182
UH, YEAH. YEAH, YOU COULD,

25:13.182 --> 25:15.885
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
DO IT RIGHT NOW.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.052
HEY, THANKS FOR DOING THAT.

25:23.052 --> 25:24.193
DOING WHAT?

25:24.193 --> 25:26.756
NOT SHOOTING HIM DOWN.

25:26.756 --> 25:29.228
I KNOW HE'S PROBABLY NOT
YOUR TYPE.

25:29.228 --> 25:32.261
NO, I LIKE HIM. HE'S NICE.

25:32.261 --> 25:35.164
WELL, YEAH, YEAH,
BUT, UH...

25:35.164 --> 25:37.667
CLEARLY NOT IN YOUR LEAGUE.

25:48.818 --> 25:50.820
I'M SORRY YOU HAVE
TO WORK LATE, SWEETIE.

25:50.820 --> 25:53.322
DON'T WORRY ABOUT US.
EVERYTHING IS FINE HERE.

25:53.322 --> 25:55.825
(beep)
 GOOD NIGHT, ANA.

25:55.825 --> 25:58.057
(whispers) OH! SORRY.

25:58.057 --> 26:01.130
(imitating snoring)

26:10.199 --> 26:12.241
ANA PAID ME $5.

(music stops, crowd murmuring)

27:02.852 --> 27:06.125
OKAY. HI. MY NIECE IS SOMEWHERE
IN THIS BUILDING.

27:06.125 --> 27:10.029
SHE'S GOT BROWN HAIR,
GOLD LEGGINGS, A CREAM TOP...

27:10.029 --> 27:12.161
WHICH SHE TOOK FROM MY CLOSET.

27:12.161 --> 27:15.234
SO IF YOU COULD JUST LOOK AROUND
AND POINT HER OUT...

27:15.234 --> 27:18.207
(groaning and murmuring)

27:18.207 --> 27:21.210
NO, HEY, HEY, THIS IS IMPORTANT,
OKAY? SHE'S ONLY 16.

27:21.210 --> 27:25.114
AND SHE CAME HERE EVEN THOUGH
SHE KNEW SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO.

27:25.114 --> 27:28.718
(booing)

27:28.718 --> 27:30.379
HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!

27:30.379 --> 27:32.381
EITHER YOU FIND MY NIECE,

27:32.381 --> 27:36.085
OR I WILL CALL THE COPS
WITH THEIR DRUG-SNIFFING DOGS.

27:36.085 --> 27:39.088
(groaning,
indistinct conversations)

27:39.088 --> 27:42.431
(man) FOUND HER OVER HERE!

27:42.431 --> 27:45.434
HERE SHE IS!
 STOP. PUT ME DOWN.

27:45.434 --> 27:47.366
SOMEBODY...

27:47.366 --> 27:50.399
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.
LET ME DOWN.

27:50.399 --> 27:52.241
GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
UGH.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.405
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

27:56.405 --> 27:58.808
(indistinct conversations)
 (man)
PUT THE MUSIC BACK ON.

27:58.808 --> 28:01.310
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO MESS WITH ME.

28:08.017 --> 28:09.819
(engine turns off)

28:09.819 --> 28:12.121
(dog barking in distance)

28:12.121 --> 28:15.825
(sighs) I CANNOT
KEEP DOING THIS, ANA.

28:15.825 --> 28:20.269
OR WHAT?
YOU'RE GONNA THROW ME OUT?

28:20.269 --> 28:21.230
FINE.

28:23.132 --> 28:26.205
YOU'D ACTUALLY
BE DOING ME A FAVOR.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.207
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.280
YOU'RE 16. HOW EXACTLY
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE MONEY?

28:33.412 --> 28:35.785
I'M... I'M GONNA BE A MODEL.

28:37.887 --> 28:39.388
A MODEL?
 YEAH.

28:39.388 --> 28:42.321
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TELL ME
THAT I'M PRETTY ENOUGH.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.894
I-I WILL JUST--I'LL GO
TO PARIS OR NEW YORK,

28:44.894 --> 28:46.896
AND I'LL GET DISCOVERED.

28:46.896 --> 28:49.498
AND I WILL BE
RICH AND FAMOUS,

28:49.498 --> 28:52.802
AND NO ONE WILL EVER
TELL ME WHAT TO DO AGAIN.

28:52.802 --> 28:56.465
AND YOU REALLY THINK IT'S
THAT EASY TO BECOME A MODEL?

28:56.465 --> 28:58.167
IT WAS FOR YOU.

28:58.167 --> 29:01.070
WHAT, YOU LEFT HOME
WHEN YOU WERE ONLY 15.

29:01.070 --> 29:04.043
NO, I LEFT BECAUSE I HAD TO.
MY STEPFATHER WAS...

29:04.043 --> 29:06.115
(sighs) NOT A NICE MAN.

29:06.115 --> 29:08.117
MY MOTHER
DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ME.

29:08.117 --> 29:10.749
MY FATHER LEFT WHEN I WAS 3,

29:10.749 --> 29:14.253
AND MY MOTHER'S BEEN IN AND OUT
OF PRISON EVER SINCE.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.255
I CAN BEAT YOU AT THIS GAME.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.889
THIS IS NOT A GAME, ANA!
THIS IS YOUR LIFE.
 (sighs)

29:19.889 --> 29:21.891
YOU CAN'T SCARE ME,
ALL RIGHT?

29:21.891 --> 29:24.894
AND I DON'T STAY
WHERE I'M NOT WANTED.
 OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

29:24.894 --> 29:27.436
WE FEED YOU.
WE PUT A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD.

29:27.436 --> 29:31.370
AND YOU'RE ALSO KEEPING
ALL YOUR OPTIONS OPEN.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.943
YEAH.

29:33.943 --> 29:35.444
I HEARD.

29:41.450 --> 29:42.982
(car door slams)

29:42.982 --> 29:45.855
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE BACK.

29:45.855 --> 29:48.187
THE GIRLS HAVEN'T MADE A PEEP.

29:53.022 --> 29:54.363
GABY?

30:01.270 --> 30:05.204
(sighs)

30:07.376 --> 30:09.378
(sets down pen)
 NO MORE OPTIONS.

30:09.378 --> 30:11.510
I AM NOW OFFICIALLY
YOUR GUARDIAN.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.412
SO... WHAT?

30:13.412 --> 30:15.414
I'M SUPPOSED TO HUG YOU NOW?

30:15.414 --> 30:18.087
NO, YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT
TO HUG ME,

30:18.087 --> 30:20.089
BECAUSE FROM HERE ON OUT,

30:20.089 --> 30:22.391
I AM GONNA BE WATCHING YOU
LIKE A HAWK.

30:22.391 --> 30:25.394
I WANNA KNOW WHERE YOU ARE
GOING, WHO YOU ARE GOING WITH,

30:25.394 --> 30:27.356
AND WHEN YOU ARE COMING HOME.

30:27.356 --> 30:30.159
AND I'M GONNA KEEP YOU
FROM RUINING THAT LIFE

30:30.159 --> 30:32.161
YOU ARE SO ANXIOUS
TO START LIVING.

30:32.161 --> 30:35.134
YOU ARE SO MEAN.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.435
(grunts)
 YEAH.

30:36.435 --> 30:39.909
AND I WISH...

30:39.909 --> 30:42.571
(sighs) I WISH...

30:42.571 --> 30:47.176
SOMEONE HAD BEEN THIS MEAN TO ME
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.627
(running footsteps)
 (door slams)

30:58.627 --> 31:00.890
(Julie) DANNY, LOOK,
IT'S COMPLICATED.

31:00.890 --> 31:03.893
NO, IT'S REALLY SIMPLE,
JULIE.

31:03.893 --> 31:05.895
YOU ONLY CARE
ABOUT YOURSELF.

31:05.895 --> 31:09.398
(sighs)
PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN!
 GO TO HELL.

31:22.511 --> 31:24.313
(sighs)

31:24.313 --> 31:27.256
KATHERINE SAID YOU WERE HERE.

31:27.256 --> 31:29.488
AND I THOUGHT, SINCE YOU WERE
ALREADY IN CHURCH,

31:29.488 --> 31:31.220
WE MIGHT SEE THE PASTOR

31:31.220 --> 31:33.222
AND SCHEDULE
SOME COUNSELING SESSIONS.

31:33.222 --> 31:35.224
I DON'T NEED COUNSELING, ORSON.
I NEED A DIVORCE.

31:35.224 --> 31:37.326
DON'T TELL ME
WE DON'T NEED COUNSELING.

31:37.326 --> 31:40.029
YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING
IN THE GUEST ROOM FOR WEEKS.

31:40.029 --> 31:42.331
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
 I AGREE, AND IF YOU HAD

31:42.331 --> 31:46.075
AN OUNCE OF CHIVALRY,
YOU'D HAVE GIVEN ME THE MASTER.

31:46.075 --> 31:48.077
YOU MIGHT THINK
THAT WITHHOLDING SEX

31:48.077 --> 31:50.079
WILL MAKE ME
GIVE UP ON US.

31:50.079 --> 31:52.381
BUT I CAN BE VERY PATIENT.

31:52.381 --> 31:54.383
YOU DO REALIZE IN PRISON,

31:54.383 --> 31:56.685
I WENT THREE WHOLE YEARS
WITHOUT ANY SEX.

31:56.685 --> 31:58.687
NO, BUT THANK YOU
FOR CLEARING UP A QUESTION

31:58.687 --> 32:01.220
I NEVER QUITE KNEW
HOW TO ASK.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.622
BREE, EIGHT YEARS AGO,

32:03.622 --> 32:05.624
WE STOOD AT AN ALTAR
LIKE THIS,

32:05.624 --> 32:08.927
AND WE MADE A VOW BEFORE GOD
TO LOVE EACH OTHER.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.660
DO YOU THINK I HAVEN'T
STRUGGLED WITH THIS?

32:11.660 --> 32:14.703
I'VE STRUGGLED WITH THIS IN WAYS
YOU CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE.

32:14.703 --> 32:17.706
THEN LET ME HELP YOU.
I CAN MAKE YOU HAPPY AGAIN.

32:17.706 --> 32:20.709
HOW? BY BLACKMAILING ME?

32:20.709 --> 32:23.712
I'M NOT YOUR WIFE ANYMORE,
ORSON. I'M YOUR CAPTIVE.

32:23.712 --> 32:26.415
DON'T YOU FEEL ANY REMORSE
AT ALL OVER THAT?

32:26.415 --> 32:28.247
OF COURSE I DO,

32:28.247 --> 32:30.079
BUT SOMETIMES GUILT

32:30.079 --> 32:32.381
IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
FOR HAPPINESS.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.731
(man) THERE IT IS.
BABY NUMBER ONE.

32:42.731 --> 32:46.195
OH, MY GOD. IT WAS SO WORTH
CUTTING CLASS TO HEAR THIS.

32:46.195 --> 32:49.238
AND... THERE'S NUMBER TWO.
GOOD, STRONG HEARTBEATS.

32:49.238 --> 32:50.539
ISN'T THAT GREAT, LYNETTE?

32:50.539 --> 32:53.442
(heartbeats playing
over ultrasound monitor)

32:53.442 --> 32:56.975
YEAH. TERRIFIC.

32:56.975 --> 33:00.109
I'LL...

33:00.109 --> 33:02.481
GET THE NURSE,
HAVE HER COME CLEAN YOU UP.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.214
THANK YOU.

33:05.214 --> 33:07.356
(door opens and closes)

33:07.356 --> 33:10.989
SO WHAT'S WITH YOU?

33:10.989 --> 33:12.321
WHAT?

33:12.321 --> 33:14.323
THAT WAS AN AMAZING MOMENT,

33:14.323 --> 33:17.726
AND YOU JUST SAT THERE
LIKE Y-YOU DIDN'T EVEN CARE.

33:20.029 --> 33:21.500
I'M JUST TIRED.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.502
LOOK, I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN
A SHOCK,

33:23.502 --> 33:26.505
AND I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU TIME,
BUT IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS.

33:26.505 --> 33:30.439
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA START
GETTING EXCITED ABOUT OUR KIDS?

33:38.387 --> 33:39.748
WHAT?

33:48.457 --> 33:50.459
(voice breaks)
I DON'T LOVE THEM.

33:54.663 --> 33:56.665
LYNETTE.

33:56.665 --> 34:00.409
PLEASE. DON'T LOOK AT ME
THAT WAY.

34:00.409 --> 34:02.411
(sniffles)

34:02.411 --> 34:04.713
IF I CAN'T TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THIS,

34:04.713 --> 34:07.346
THEN I AM IN BIG TROUBLE.
(cries)

34:07.346 --> 34:10.819
YOU'RE JUST UPSET BECAUSE...
THIS WASN'T PLANNED.

34:10.819 --> 34:13.081
NONE OF THEM WERE PLANNED,

34:13.081 --> 34:15.384
BUT I LOVED
EACH OF OUR KIDS

34:15.384 --> 34:18.726
THE MOMENT I KNEW
THEY WERE COMING.

34:18.726 --> 34:22.831
(crying)
IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

34:22.831 --> 34:26.395
I DON'T LOVE THESE BABIES.

34:29.598 --> 34:31.699
STOP SAYING THAT.

34:31.699 --> 34:34.603
(cries)

34:34.603 --> 34:36.605
WHEN YOU HOLD THEM
IN YOUR ARMS,

34:36.605 --> 34:38.607
YOU WILL CARE
ABOUT THESE KIDS

34:38.607 --> 34:41.580
JUST AS MUCH
AS THE OTHERS.

34:47.815 --> 34:49.658
OKAY.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.505
(bells tolling)

35:12.211 --> 35:15.484
I THINK I LEFT SOMETHING
IN THE CAR. I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.

35:15.484 --> 35:17.186
(mouths word)

35:20.519 --> 35:22.251
(door opens)

35:22.251 --> 35:23.792
(door closes)
 BREE.

35:23.792 --> 35:25.794
(sighs) ORSON WILL DRINK
TOO MUCH TODAY,

35:25.794 --> 35:28.797
LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES AT WEDDINGS.
HE'LL BE ASLEEP BY 9:00.

35:28.797 --> 35:31.500
MEET ME AT THE SHANGRILA MOTEL
AT 9:30.

35:31.500 --> 35:34.463
AND YOU WON'T
BAIL ON ME AGAIN?
 I BOOKED THE ROOM LAST NIGHT.

35:34.463 --> 35:37.436
I'VE ALREADY CHANGED THE SHEETS
AND CLEANED THE BATHROOM.

35:37.436 --> 35:38.737
KISS ME.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.443
(sighs)

35:44.443 --> 35:46.445
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE GOOD GIRL?

35:46.445 --> 35:47.746
SHE DECIDED GUILT'S

35:47.746 --> 35:50.579
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
FOR HAPPINESS.

35:52.421 --> 35:54.723
(organ playing in distance)

35:54.723 --> 35:56.385
AHH.

35:56.385 --> 35:58.927
FRANKLY, I THINK
IT LOOKED BETTER ON ME.

35:58.927 --> 36:01.360
KATHERINE.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.932
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

36:03.932 --> 36:06.935
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT
I'VE BEEN OUT OF SORTS LATELY,

36:06.935 --> 36:09.268
AND I JUST COULDN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY.

36:09.268 --> 36:12.241
I MEAN, SURE, I WAS DUMPED
BY THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

36:12.241 --> 36:14.243
BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.
 (drops bracelet)

36:14.243 --> 36:15.804
AND THEN IT HIT ME.

36:15.804 --> 36:17.506
MY FRIEND--

36:17.506 --> 36:20.449
WHO WAS SORT OF RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY WORLD IMPLODING--

36:20.449 --> 36:23.612
NEVER BOTHERED
TO CROSS THE STREET

36:23.612 --> 36:25.614
TO SEE HOW I WAS DOING.

36:25.614 --> 36:27.316
(object clatters)

36:33.622 --> 36:35.624
DIDN'T HAVE THE...
(sniffs)

36:35.624 --> 36:38.527
DECENCY TO APOLOGIZE.

36:42.771 --> 36:44.433
I AM VERY, VERY--

36:44.433 --> 36:47.306
NO, NOT HERE. OUT THERE.

36:47.306 --> 36:50.509
IN THE HALLWAY?
 IN YOUR CEREMONY.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.712
EVERYBODY IN TOWN
KNOWS YOU HUMILIATED ME.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.585
I THINK I DESERVE
A PUBLIC APOLOGY.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.819
IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY WEDDING?

37:00.819 --> 37:03.522
I FOUND THE PERFECT SPOT,
RIGHT HERE.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.454
AFTER THE READING
OF ECCLESIASTES

37:05.454 --> 37:08.897
AND RIGHT BEFORE
"WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN."

37:08.897 --> 37:11.360
I AM NOT DOING THAT.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.801
YES, YOU WILL,

37:12.801 --> 37:15.934
OR I WILL CREATE A SCENE
 SO UGLY

37:15.934 --> 37:17.936
YOUR GUESTS WILL
STILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT

37:17.936 --> 37:19.568
ON YOUR GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY.

37:25.574 --> 37:27.546
OKAY.

37:28.847 --> 37:32.551
BUT I AM NOT HAPPY
ABOUT THIS.

37:32.551 --> 37:35.524
AW. TRY TO SMILE ANYWAY.

37:35.524 --> 37:37.586
NOBODY LIKES A GRUMPY BRIDE.

37:37.586 --> 37:41.590
WHY DON'T WE JUST
GET THIS OVER WITH?

37:41.590 --> 37:43.632
WOULD YOU MIND
GETTING MY GLOVES?

37:43.632 --> 37:45.634
THEY'RE IN THE GARMENT BAG.

37:48.897 --> 37:51.400
AAH!
 (thud, clatter)

37:51.400 --> 37:53.041
I'M SORRY.

37:53.041 --> 37:55.273
IT'S JUST UNTIL
AFTER THE CEREMONY.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.605
(Katherine) SUSAN!

37:56.605 --> 38:00.709
AND FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,

38:00.709 --> 38:02.711
YOU SHALL BE
EACH OTHER'S HOME.

38:02.711 --> 38:05.414
YOU SHALL BE
EACH OTHER'S SANCTUARY.

38:05.414 --> 38:08.587
(pounds on door)
 (grunts) SUSAN, LET ME OUT!

38:10.989 --> 38:12.661
WITH THIS RING,

38:12.661 --> 38:15.494
I THEE WED.

38:15.494 --> 38:18.427
(grunting)

38:20.929 --> 38:22.931
(chuckles)

38:22.931 --> 38:25.574
(cheering)

38:25.574 --> 38:28.437
AAH!

38:28.437 --> 38:30.379
(sighs)

38:30.379 --> 38:34.683
(cheering continues)

38:39.488 --> 38:42.621
SORRY I'M LATE.
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

38:42.621 --> 38:45.554
WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:45.554 --> 38:48.096
SUSAN KNOWS.

38:51.660 --> 38:54.563
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT,

38:54.563 --> 38:57.536
BUT I'M ASKING YOU NICELY
TO LEAVE.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.811
AND IF YOU DON'T,
SO HELP ME GOD,

39:02.811 --> 39:05.974
I WILL DRAG YOU
OUT OF THIS CHURCH MYSELF.

39:16.585 --> 39:18.627
I'M SORRY. I...

39:20.358 --> 39:21.830
I-I JUST WANTED...

39:28.767 --> 39:30.539
(whispers) I'LL GO.

39:30.539 --> 39:32.701
KATHERINE, WAIT.

39:34.403 --> 39:37.506
UH... OH.

39:41.610 --> 39:43.852
UH... (amplified voice)
HELLO, EVERYBODY.

39:43.852 --> 39:46.154
I JUST WANNA SAY SOMETHING.

39:47.586 --> 39:50.589
OH, WE DON'T NEED THIS
ON THE VIDEO.

39:50.589 --> 39:52.591
UM...

39:52.591 --> 39:55.063
WHEN MIKE ASKED ME
TO MARRY HIM...

39:55.063 --> 39:56.995
AGAIN,

39:56.995 --> 39:59.998
IT WAS ONE OF
THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF MY LIFE.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.070
BUT FOR SOMEONE ELSE,

40:02.070 --> 40:06.034
IT WAS THE DAY
HER WHOLE WORLD FELL APART.

40:06.034 --> 40:08.477
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT, I...

40:08.477 --> 40:10.108
I DIDN'T CARE.

40:12.641 --> 40:15.143
IN THAT MOMENT,
I WAS A SELFISH PERSON,

40:15.143 --> 40:18.186
AND I CHOSE MY HAPPINESS.

40:18.186 --> 40:20.749
BUT I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW

40:20.749 --> 40:23.622
THAT I AM TRULY SORRY

40:23.622 --> 40:25.624
FOR CHANGING HER PATH.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.095
AND I HOPE

40:27.095 --> 40:29.628
THAT KATHERINE MAYFAIR
FINDS HAPPINESS

40:29.628 --> 40:33.101
AND CAN FIND IT IN HER HEART
TO FORGIVE ME...

40:35.634 --> 40:37.636
(normal voice)
AND BE MY FRIEND AGAIN.

40:49.618 --> 40:52.521
(whispers)
I HOPE THAT HELPED.

40:52.521 --> 40:54.983
HONESTLY...

40:54.983 --> 40:56.655
IT DIDN'T.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.670
(sighs)
 (doors close)

41:13.702 --> 41:15.674
(exhales deeply)

41:15.674 --> 41:17.676
WHERE THE HELL IS DANNY?

41:17.676 --> 41:20.048
HE LEFT THE WEDDING TWO HOURS
AGO AND HE'S NOT IN HIS ROOM.

41:20.048 --> 41:23.481
HE'LL BE HOME SOON.
 YOU KNOW,
WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO THAT KID?

41:23.481 --> 41:26.715
HE'S STAYING OUT LATE, PICKIN'
FIGHTS WITH GIRLS IN PUBLIC.

41:26.715 --> 41:29.187
HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THAT.
 HE'S A TEENAGER.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.889
WELL, GO LOOK FOR HIM.

41:33.161 --> 41:35.624
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO MAKE WAVES HERE.

41:35.624 --> 41:39.167
EVERYONE HAS TO THINK
WE ARE NICE, NORMAL PEOPLE.

41:39.167 --> 41:41.029
YEAH.

41:51.680 --> 41:55.584
IT'S NOT HARD
TO FIND SIN IN THE SUBURBS.

41:55.584 --> 41:59.017
JUST LOOK BEHIND CLOSED DOORS,

41:59.017 --> 42:01.720
AND YOU'LL FIND YOUR NEIGHBORS

42:01.720 --> 42:03.892
CHEATING ON THEIR HUSBANDS....

42:07.796 --> 42:10.599
RESENTING THEIR CHILDREN...

42:14.032 --> 42:16.805
PLOTTING AGAINST THEIR FRIENDS.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.841
BUT AS MUCH AS WE LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT

42:22.841 --> 42:27.145
THE SINFUL THINGS PEOPLE DO...

42:28.677 --> 42:32.651
WE FORGET THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SIN...

42:32.651 --> 42:34.623
(bottles clanking)
 AND EVIL.

42:34.623 --> 42:37.686
(gasping)

42:37.686 --> 42:41.189
(choking)

42:41.189 --> 42:44.192
(dog barking)

42:45.563 --> 42:47.065
(thud)

42:47.065 --> 42:51.670
SADLY, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE
WILLING TO COME ALONG

42:51.670 --> 42:53.842
AND REMIND US.
