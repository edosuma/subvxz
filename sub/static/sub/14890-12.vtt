(Balki)
Okay, Dimitri, watch closely.

01:22.783 --> 01:26.286
We have here
an ordinary souffle pan.

01:27.153 --> 01:28.488
We say the magic words.

01:28.522 --> 01:33.827
Abracapocus elia kazan
and flambe.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.629
Ah!

01:45.438 --> 01:46.773
’Hey, cousin, you just’

01:46.807 --> 01:49.442
you just missed a magic trick
by the Great Balkini.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.412
Life is so unfair sometimes.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.281
Cousin, I could do it again.

01:55.315 --> 01:56.683
’No, thank you, Balki.’

01:57.784 --> 01:58.852
Well, that’s okay.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.587
You’ll see
plenty of magic tonight.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.288
The Amazing Timmy is performing

02:02.322 --> 02:04.224
at the Youth Center
charity show.

02:04.257 --> 02:05.559
Ping.

02:16.302 --> 02:20.173
Balki, I’m not going to the
Youth Center charity show.

02:20.206 --> 02:21.341
‐You’re not going?
‐No.

02:21.374 --> 02:22.643
You asked me this morning
if I was going.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.877
‐And what did I say?
‐You said no.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.246
And then you asked me again
at lunch, and what did I say?

02:26.279 --> 02:27.313
‐You said no.
‐That’s right.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.582
Do you see a pattern here?

02:30.751 --> 02:34.387
Well, you know,
usually, if I keep asking

02:34.420 --> 02:36.857
eventually, I wear you down.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.625
‐Well, the answer is still no.
‐I’ll check with you later.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.894
I’ll save you the trouble.
No.

02:40.927 --> 02:41.962
‐Come on, cousin.
‐No. No.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.630
‐Come on, please.
‐I’m not going.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.799
Come on, come on, come on,
you want to go, you want to‐‐

02:45.832 --> 02:47.734
‐Stop it.
‐Oh, God.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.303
I’m tired, I’m discouraged.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.972
Not to mention
a little cranky.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.640
And with good reason.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.341
All week long I dug and I dug

02:55.375 --> 02:57.911
trying to come up with
a big story, and I have nothing.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.379
Nothing.

03:15.896 --> 03:20.366
Wainwright rejected
every story idea I had.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.402
I‐if I don’t come up
with something

03:22.435 --> 03:25.405
a‐a story,
an interview, something...

03:27.874 --> 03:30.644
I’m going to be writing an
obituary for my own career.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.813
Well, at least
you’ll still be writing.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.951
Well, Balki, the important
thing is that I‐I get a story.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.301
This is important too,
the kids wait all year

03:55.335 --> 03:56.937
for this annual variety show.

03:56.970 --> 03:57.971
Ow.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.375
Y‐you know, they‐they’ll all be
looking forward to it.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.949
You don’t know
what you’re missing.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.985
‐Take photos.
‐Alright, alright.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.219
I’m gonna go get dressed.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.289
They‐they’re expecting me
to come and help them set up.

04:16.322 --> 04:19.425
But, cousin, cheer up,
you’ll come up with something.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.928
‐I got nothing.
‐Oh, come on, cousin.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.531
You never know,
life is full of surprises.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.599
‐Ping.
‐Ow.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.004
How did you do that?

04:31.037 --> 04:33.540
Well, I can’t tell you.
For two reasons.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.843
Number one, I’d be violating
the code of the magicians.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.879
And number two, I have no idea.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.749
[knock on door]

04:42.783 --> 04:43.984
Oh.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.991
‐Hello, Larry.
‐Oh, hello, Mrs. O’Neal.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.026
‐I hope I’m not bothering you.
‐No.

04:53.059 --> 04:55.662
I just wanted to drop off
these programs for Balki

04:55.696 --> 04:57.097
to bring to the show tonight.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.732
Well, I‐I’ll make sure
he gets them.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.033
Oh, thank you.

05:00.066 --> 05:03.904
Organizing this charity show
is so much work.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.839
Oh, I have to make
the seating arrangements

05:05.872 --> 05:07.073
talk to the lighting man

05:07.107 --> 05:10.611
and now, the Secret Service men
are driving me just crazy

05:10.644 --> 05:12.713
about Margaret Thatcher
stopping by.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.351
‐You didn’t hear that.
‐Margaret Thatcher?

05:18.384 --> 05:19.953
The ex‐prime minister
of Great Britain?

05:19.986 --> 05:24.490
Well, yes, but, oh, please
don’t say a word to anyone.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.427
She’s doing it for me
as a special favor.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.430
Mags and I went to
school together.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.633
And I promised her
there would be no press

05:32.666 --> 05:34.467
or television people there.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.571
Oh, she doesn’t want to make
a circus out of it, you know.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.840
Well, your secret is safe
with me.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.609
Oh, thank you, Larry.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.979
And remember,
mum’s the word on Mrs. T.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.447
Mum, mum, mum, mum, mum.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.519
Yes! Yes!

05:52.553 --> 05:54.988
‐Cousin?
‐Yes?

05:55.021 --> 05:57.357
‐About that charity show‐‐
‐Okay, I’ll come.

05:59.826 --> 06:00.994
Come again?

06:01.027 --> 06:03.063
You know, Balki, I’ve been
thinking about those kids.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.131
And I’ve been very selfish.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.000
Putting my career
above the happiness

06:07.033 --> 06:10.170
of those little children.
So, I’ve decided to come.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.839
Oh, cousin, now everything’s
coming up roses.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.344
(male #1)
’Ready? Ready.’

06:18.378 --> 06:21.982
Okay, Woody, concentrate.
Which shell is the pea under?

06:22.716 --> 06:24.651
Um...this one.

06:25.652 --> 06:26.753
Ta‐da!

06:33.459 --> 06:35.529
‐’Yeah.’
‐’Oh, great, great.’

06:35.562 --> 06:37.463
’You’re a little guy.
You have so many, uh...’

06:37.497 --> 06:39.032
[kids laughing]

06:40.501 --> 06:42.869
It’s okay. I know you’re
with the Secret Service.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.574
I’m handling things
for Mrs. O’Neil.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.442
Is everything
on schedule with Mrs. T?

06:51.512 --> 06:53.079
Everything’s fine, thanks.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.583
Roger.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.622
[laughing]

07:02.789 --> 07:04.157
Where’s the Amazing Timmy?

07:04.190 --> 07:05.491
He’s the last act, isn’t he?

07:05.526 --> 07:06.426
Oh, he’ll be here.

07:06.459 --> 07:09.763
He told me he had to go
to a stag party.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.598
That Timmy must love deer.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.069
Balki, a stag party’s
got nothing to do with deer.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.705
Well, cousin,
I beg to quibble with you.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.474
I distinctly remember
Timmy telling me

07:21.508 --> 07:24.144
that a certain Bambi was going
to be jumping out of a cake.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.848
My mistake.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.189
Oh, Mr. Amazing Timmy.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.659
I‐I want, I want you
to meet my cousin, Larry.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.028
It’s a pleasure
to meet you.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.135
[snoring]

07:49.169 --> 07:52.939
I have never seen a performer
so relaxed before a performance.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.544
Balki, he is drunk.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.779
Help me get him over
to the couch over here.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.113
Okay.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.849
[grunts]

08:02.883 --> 08:05.819
[both grunt]

08:15.328 --> 08:16.663
Oh!

08:26.873 --> 08:30.043
Well, looks like
the Amazing Timmy

08:30.076 --> 08:32.111
was practicing
his disappearing Scotch trick.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.782
Balki, go get some coffee.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.551
Cream and Sweet ’n Low, cousin?

08:37.583 --> 08:41.554
Not for me. For him, for him.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.760
Do you want anything?

08:51.998 --> 08:53.634
Is this the magic act?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.636
Well, it was.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.572
This is Agent Hansen.

08:58.605 --> 09:00.741
Show ended early.
Skip the youth center.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.009
Take Mrs. Thatcher
directly to her next stop.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.344
W‐w‐wait a minute.
What do you mean?

09:04.377 --> 09:05.912
She‐she’s still
coming here right?

09:05.946 --> 09:07.881
No, no, the show ends early

09:07.914 --> 09:09.249
and Mrs. Thatcher has
a very tight schedule.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.884
She goes right to her next stop.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.553
She can’t do that.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.188
She can do
whatever she wants.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.693
No, no, no, I‐I mean
th‐th‐the show will go on.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.162
Th‐the magic act will go on.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.932
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
You gotta get out there.

09:25.966 --> 09:29.235
You’ve got to do your magic act
or my life is over.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.875
Cousin, I had no idea
you were such a magic fan.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.645
That’s it, this show is over.

09:38.679 --> 09:42.248
No. No, no, no. No, no, no.
The show will go on.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.917
We have another magician.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.385
‐We do, cousin?
‐Yes.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.789
Yes, the Great Balkini
will go on.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.794
[instrumental music]

10:01.334 --> 10:03.303
[drum roll]

10:05.038 --> 10:06.039
Good evening.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.944
I am the Great Balkini.

10:13.413 --> 10:14.948
Oh.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.282
[laughing]

10:17.784 --> 10:18.919
And I would like you now

10:18.952 --> 10:21.955
to welcome
my lovely assistant, Cousini.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.902
For my first trick
I require a ten dollar bill.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.804
Cousini, have you
a ten dollar bill?

10:45.245 --> 10:48.081
For my first trick,
I will take this ten dollar bill

10:48.114 --> 10:50.350
and rip it in many, many pieces.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.892
[kids laughing]

11:03.864 --> 11:07.100
[clears throat]
I will rip this ten dollar bill
into many, many pieces.

11:12.506 --> 11:16.409
And now, I will magically
reassemble the ten dollar bill.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.713
Abracapocus elia kazan.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.717
Voila.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.854
[laughing]

11:29.189 --> 11:31.424
This is what
the Amazing Timmy taught you?

11:31.457 --> 11:33.226
You know, I‐I think
I know what went wrong.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.161
I think it’s supposed
to be a twenty.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.997
Have you, have you
got a twenty, cousin?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.498
‐No.
‐Cousin, I saw.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.766
‐I know you have a twenty.
‐No. No.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.967
‐No. No. No.
‐Let me have a twenty.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.268
Do another trick.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.072
[clears throat]
For my next trick

11:46.106 --> 11:47.473
I will make
this table disappear.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.213
Where do I
come up with them?

11:55.949 --> 11:59.085
For my next trick,
I will make a rabbit appear.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.153
[drum roll]

12:10.330 --> 12:12.733
Please note,
there is nothing in the bucket.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.909
[clears throat]

12:24.010 --> 12:26.479
Abracapocus elia kazam.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.883
And voila, a rabbit‐chicken.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.819
[laughing]

12:32.853 --> 12:34.888
A rabbit chi... A rabid chicken.

12:34.921 --> 12:38.058
Cousin, please take it away
before it bites someone.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.895
‐The rabbit, get to the rabbit.
‐Alright.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.802
’Now I will make
a rabbit appear.’

12:49.469 --> 12:51.938
’Abracapocus elia kazam.’

12:53.439 --> 12:54.340
’Voila.’

12:54.374 --> 12:58.178
‐Is she here yet?
‐No, is the act over?

12:58.211 --> 13:00.013
No.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.414
Well, it looks that way to me.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.852
B‐B‐Balki, Balki,
where are you going?

13:05.886 --> 13:08.154
I’m done, cousin, it’s over.
The show is over.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.224
And if I must say so myself
Balkini was a hit.

13:11.257 --> 13:14.060
Balki, you’ve gotta get back
out there and do more.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.029
Cousin, I‐I don’t have any more.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.534
Balki, Balki, if you
don’t go back out there

13:20.567 --> 13:22.468
Margaret Thatcher won’t show up.

13:22.503 --> 13:24.070
Eh...

13:28.975 --> 13:30.877
Margaret Thatcher?

13:30.911 --> 13:32.579
Margaret Thatcher?
No, I said "Body Snatcher."

13:32.613 --> 13:35.081
"Body Snatcher."
"Body Snatcher," yeah.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.149
La‐later on they’re showing

13:36.182 --> 13:37.951
"Invasion
Of The Body Snatchers."

13:37.984 --> 13:40.854
Which is why it is so important
that you go back out there

13:40.887 --> 13:44.457
because, uh,
because, uh, because, uh

13:44.490 --> 13:45.592
because of the children.

13:45.626 --> 13:47.528
The children,
look at the children.

13:47.561 --> 13:50.030
Just look at the children.
Just look at the children.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.232
‐Cousin.
‐Just look... Alright, I lied.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.467
I lied, I lied.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.402
I‐I’ll tell you the real truth.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.172
I have a very rare disease.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.642
‐Cousin.
‐Alright.

14:01.675 --> 14:06.580
Alright, I lied again,
I lied again, please.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.082
Alright, I’ll tell you
the real real truth.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.088
Well, when Mrs. O’Neil
came by to drop off the programs

14:15.121 --> 14:17.190
she let it slip that
Mrs. Thatcher was dropping by

14:17.223 --> 14:19.392
this evening, and she asked me
not to tell anyone.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.594
So, naturally,
I phoned Wainwright

14:20.627 --> 14:22.596
and‐and told him that
I’d have an exclusive interview

14:22.629 --> 14:24.330
on his desk tomorrow morning.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.001
And‐and now, she’s not coming
by, the show’s over

14:28.034 --> 14:30.136
I won’t get my interview

14:30.170 --> 14:34.140
and Mr. Wainwright’s
gonna fire me.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.183
So, you’re only here for
your own selfish reasons.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.952
‐That sounds so harsh.
‐And you lied to me.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.288
Ow! Yes, I lied to you.
It was for the children‐‐

14:48.321 --> 14:49.690
‐Cousin.
‐Alright, alright.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.292
I’m‐I’m just a selfish liar.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.662
There’s absolutely no reason
why you should help me.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.565
Well, that’s for sure.

14:59.365 --> 15:00.667
What’s the story?

15:02.603 --> 15:05.438
‐The show will go on.
‐Oh, it will?

15:05.471 --> 15:08.509
Oh, thank you, Balki.
Thank you, thank you.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.310
‐But I’m gonna need your help.
‐You got it.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.282
The show’s going on.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.492
‐Are you ready for more magic?
‐Yeah.

15:28.729 --> 15:30.997
For my first encore trick

15:31.031 --> 15:32.098
I will do the famous

15:32.132 --> 15:36.236
milk disappearing into
the newspaper funnel trick.

15:36.269 --> 15:40.173
Cousini, may I please have the
newspaper funnel and the milk?

15:42.375 --> 15:43.544
Thank you.

15:43.577 --> 15:46.613
Now, Cousini will place the
newspaper funnel into his pants.

15:53.587 --> 15:55.488
Oh, no, he won’t.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.390
Oh, yes, he will.

15:58.792 --> 16:03.096
If he really wants this
interview, believe me, he will.

16:14.140 --> 16:18.512
I will now pour the milk
into the newspaper funnel.

16:18.545 --> 16:19.445
You sure you know
what you’re doing?

16:19.479 --> 16:23.149
Oh, I’ve, I’ve
never been more sure.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.093
[laughing]

16:43.537 --> 16:45.005
Hey, they can’t all work.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.374
Cousini, please.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.717
I will now attempt...

16:58.284 --> 17:00.253
...to cut someone in half.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.356
Do I have any volunteers?

17:03.389 --> 17:06.192
Anyone? Just, just, just raise
your hands, raise your hands.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.429
Oh, here’s someone.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.766
Absolutely not.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.800
Well, then I guess
you don’t want that interview.

17:14.835 --> 17:16.336
Thank you and goodnight.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.339
W‐w‐wait a minute.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.406
Wo‐wouldn’t you, uh

17:20.440 --> 17:24.344
rather see a‐a‐a nifty
disappearing nickel trick?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.046
(all)
No.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.116
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:31.351 --> 17:35.522
Yeah, alright, uh,
the‐the Great Balkini.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.257
[all cheering]

17:39.760 --> 17:41.061
‐Get in the box.
‐W‐w‐wait.

17:41.094 --> 17:44.397
Wouldn’t it be more fun if one
of the kids got into the box?

17:44.430 --> 17:48.201
Yes, you would, yes, you would.
Wouldn’t that be fun?

17:48.234 --> 17:50.671
(all)
No!

17:50.704 --> 17:53.640
‐Well, you ungrateful little‐‐
‐Get in the box, Bozo.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.310
[instrumental music]

18:36.583 --> 18:37.884
Oh.

18:37.918 --> 18:39.485
[kids gasp]

18:42.689 --> 18:45.225
Balki, y‐y‐you sure
you know what you’re doing?

18:45.258 --> 18:46.927
Relax, cousin,
I’ve seen the Amazing Timmy

18:46.960 --> 18:49.262
do it a hundred times.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.897
Never could figure out
how it was done.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.603
Now, I will attempt
to cut Cousini in half.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.872
[drum roll]

19:08.949 --> 19:11.184
Whoa! Whoa. Oh!

19:24.464 --> 19:26.399
Oh, ah, oh, oh, ah.

19:33.840 --> 19:34.875
[screams]

19:41.748 --> 19:44.785
Now, shall we see if
the Great Balkini has succeeded?

19:57.397 --> 19:59.232
[all applauding]

20:11.311 --> 20:12.478
Oh.

20:12.513 --> 20:14.915
[Larry laughing]

20:19.385 --> 20:21.888
Stop it!

20:21.922 --> 20:27.360
Excuse me, Balkini,
I have a very special surprise.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.664
Mrs. Thatcher will be here
momentarily

20:30.697 --> 20:34.334
and she would love to say
a few words to all of you.

20:34.835 --> 20:36.402
[all applauding]

20:39.372 --> 20:41.842
Balki, Balki, put me back
together. Get me out of here.

20:41.875 --> 20:42.909
’Okay.’

20:42.943 --> 20:45.912
[panting]

20:47.581 --> 20:51.718
Now, I will attempt to put
Cousini back together again.

20:52.586 --> 20:54.555
[drum roll]

20:58.725 --> 21:01.061
Cousin, I‐I can’t,
I‐I can’t get it unlocked.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.228
Well, try harder.

21:03.997 --> 21:06.800
Let’s, uh, let’s get this
junk out of here, alright?

21:07.701 --> 21:10.804
Oh. Oh. Oh.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.473
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.581
[instrumental music]

21:22.749 --> 21:25.451
I’m really sorry that I couldn’t
let you out of the box.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.454
Oh, that’s okay, Balki.
It wasn’t your fault.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.390
I got what I deserved.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.727
I should have been honest
with you from the start.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.729
Well, I‐I can’t argue with that.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.932
I just wanted
that interview so much.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.003
And now I have to
tell Mr. Wainwright

21:43.036 --> 21:46.707
that I didn’t get an interview
with Margaret Thatcher

21:46.740 --> 21:50.877
because I was cut in half
and stuck in a box.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.648
Cousin, you know,
I think Mrs. Thatcher

21:54.681 --> 21:56.950
would find that really amusing.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.820
She’s‐she’s really
quite the charming lady.

21:59.853 --> 22:00.887
You talked to her?

22:00.921 --> 22:04.390
Oh, yes,
quite a bit actually.

22:05.025 --> 22:06.492
You‐you interviewed her?

22:07.160 --> 22:08.394
Oh, yeah, sure.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.731
Oh, I can’t believe this.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.133
Well, you know,
I am going to need a good writer

22:13.166 --> 22:15.902
to turn my interview
into an article.

22:16.903 --> 22:20.006
Do I, um, have any volunteers?

22:20.040 --> 22:21.542
Oh, oh, oh.

22:21.575 --> 22:23.510
Just, uh, raise your hands.

22:25.646 --> 22:27.147
[banging on box]

22:27.180 --> 22:29.049
Just, uh... Anybody?

22:29.082 --> 22:31.084
[sobbing]

22:31.117 --> 22:33.119
Oh, here’s one.

22:33.153 --> 22:36.623
Thank you, Balki. Thank you.

22:36.657 --> 22:38.625
I‐I hope you can make
something out of this, cousin.

22:38.659 --> 22:40.794
‐It’s pretty dry stuff.
‐I’ll try my best.

22:43.063 --> 22:44.831
[instrumental music]

22:54.007 --> 22:56.943
[instrumental music]
