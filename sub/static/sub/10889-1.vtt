01:27.686 --> 01:30.052
Oh!

01:30.089 --> 01:31.750
Oh my God, oh my God.

01:31.790 --> 01:34.657
Hello.
No one is available to take your call.

01:34.693 --> 01:36.991
Please leave a message
after the tone.

01:37.029 --> 01:39.554
Sammy boy.

01:39.598 --> 01:42.931
Big day today.
It's going to be great.

01:42.968 --> 01:45.835
Will you call me after your meeting?
I need you to talk me down.

01:45.871 --> 01:47.805
You're going to wear
the blue shirt, right?

01:47.840 --> 01:49.967
Ugh, this happens to me
every time I host a party.

01:50.009 --> 01:52.637
There's this moment beforehand
where I prepare myself to learn

01:52.678 --> 01:55.442
that I'm not nearly as well-liked
as I thought I was.

01:55.481 --> 01:58.609
Tuck tuck.
Don't forget to tuck.

01:58.651 --> 02:01.085
Ugh, this is weird, Sam.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.055
You've got to admit,
I'm having a weird party.

02:04.089 --> 02:06.990
Okay, why am I still talking?
You're probably gone by now.

02:07.026 --> 02:08.788
Oh look, you're calling me.

02:08.827 --> 02:10.317
- Hello?
- This is bad.

02:10.362 --> 02:12.660
- What? What happened?
- I overslept.

02:12.698 --> 02:14.529
Sam, the meeting's not till 10:00.
You'll be fine.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.558
Oh, I fear success.
Why do I fear success?

02:16.602 --> 02:18.001
What are you talking about?

02:18.037 --> 02:21.200
I went out last night trying to
fuck up my life and it worked.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.071
Wait, before we get to you,
can you come early tonight?

02:23.108 --> 02:24.598
I'm convinced no one's
going to show.

02:24.643 --> 02:26.110
You're wrong,
but I'll get there early.

02:26.145 --> 02:27.578
- When?
- First thing.

02:27.613 --> 02:28.773
Oh, I fucked this up bad.

02:28.814 --> 02:30.406
- I'm so fucked.
- Sam, breathe for me.

02:30.449 --> 02:32.110
- Take deep breaths.
- Whew.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.641
Good.
Now listen to me.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.620
It's going to go amazing.
Because you know why?

02:35.654 --> 02:37.212
- Why?
- Because it has to.

02:37.256 --> 02:40.054
You're the voice of our generation.

02:40.092 --> 02:42.890
- That's a lot of pressure.
- Sorry.

02:42.928 --> 02:44.896
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

03:15.561 --> 03:17.825
#Do I believe in this #

03:17.863 --> 03:21.993
#Or is this the only way
to get around in my life? #

03:25.304 --> 03:27.135
#Do I deserve this? #

03:27.172 --> 03:29.800
#No, you deserve
much better #

03:29.842 --> 03:32.242
#In your life #

03:32.277 --> 03:36.270
#In your life #

03:43.522 --> 03:47.720
#Thinking of you,
thinking of you #

03:47.760 --> 03:53.323
#So what can I do
when I'm thinking of you? #

04:04.009 --> 04:06.204
#Do I believe in this #

04:06.245 --> 04:10.341
#Or is this the only way
to get around in my life? #

04:13.585 --> 04:15.450
#Do I deserve this? #

04:15.487 --> 04:20.618
#No no, you deserve
much better in your life #

04:20.659 --> 04:25.221
#In your life #

04:32.104 --> 04:36.131
#Thinking of you,
thinking of you #

04:36.175 --> 04:41.044
#So what can I do
when I'm thinking of you? #

04:41.080 --> 04:45.073
#Thinking of you? #

04:45.117 --> 04:46.914
Stop.

04:49.955 --> 04:52.725
I said stop.

05:19.251 --> 05:21.446
Stopping 14th Street.
Next stop 23rd.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.478
Stand clear of the closing doors.

05:46.278 --> 05:50.112
It's okay.
We'll just, um...

05:50.149 --> 05:52.140
it'll be okay.

05:54.319 --> 05:55.980
Uh, hey.

05:56.021 --> 05:58.649
This... this kid got separated
from his mom on the train.

05:58.690 --> 06:02.057
- So?
- So? I gotta... what do I do?

06:02.094 --> 06:04.927
Well, take him to the police station...
21st and Third.

06:04.963 --> 06:07.864
Thanks. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.666
Hey, what are you doing?
They're going to help you.

06:16.108 --> 06:18.576
I gotta leave you here, dude.
I don't know what else to do with you.

06:21.613 --> 06:25.049
Fuck!
Don't swear.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.108
Do you know your address?

06:27.152 --> 06:29.416
Come on, dude, help me out.
I am so late.

06:29.454 --> 06:32.685
What's your name?
My name's Sam.

06:32.724 --> 06:34.715
Look, I... I know it's not good
to talk to strangers,

06:34.760 --> 06:37.285
but I'm clearly a good citizen
or something.

06:37.329 --> 06:40.025
I'm trying to help you.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.399
Subway's two blocks that way.

06:51.443 --> 06:53.434
Good luck.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.058
Smith-Crowley.

07:20.138 --> 07:22.163
Hi. I am ridiculously late

07:22.207 --> 07:23.765
for my meeting
with Paul Gertmanian.

07:23.809 --> 07:25.743
- Your name?
- Sam Wexler.

07:25.777 --> 07:27.768
Just take a seat.

07:39.258 --> 07:42.386
Smith-Crowley.

07:45.230 --> 07:47.391
Hey, um, when I go in there,

07:47.432 --> 07:49.423
would you mind
keeping an eye on him?

07:49.468 --> 07:51.402
What's his name?

07:51.436 --> 07:54.963
Ask him.
He likes to chat.

08:00.212 --> 08:02.680
Susan speaks
very highly of you.

08:02.714 --> 08:05.182
She told me, "The one thing
about Sam is he's always on time

08:05.217 --> 08:07.344
for an important meeting."

08:11.023 --> 08:13.514
Well...

08:13.558 --> 08:17.153
No, this is... this is tightly paced.
It's funny.

08:17.195 --> 08:19.186
Engaging characters
that sound like real people.

08:19.231 --> 08:20.721
It's...

08:20.766 --> 08:23.394
But... how to put this?

08:23.435 --> 08:25.164
Your protagonist Alan...

08:25.203 --> 08:26.568
- Alex.
- Right.

08:26.605 --> 08:29.472
I don't know if you want people
to love this guy or hate this guy.

08:29.508 --> 08:32.477
He's kind of ambitious.
He's kind of mature.

08:32.510 --> 08:36.379
He's kind of just kind of.
Novels are tricky, Sam.

08:36.414 --> 08:38.405
Susan says your short stories
are wonderful.

08:38.450 --> 08:40.042
But it seems to us
that you haven't

08:40.085 --> 08:43.145
entirely adapted
to the longer form.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.248
The novel requires a different kind
of commitment than the short story.

08:46.291 --> 08:47.656
Excuse me for one second.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.660
Hey hey!
Where are you going?

09:04.309 --> 09:09.042
Ah. Question: who is he?

09:09.081 --> 09:12.141
He's just, uh...

09:12.184 --> 09:14.311
just a kid.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.344
Thanks for coming in.

09:26.365 --> 09:29.163
- Bye, Rasheen.
- Bye.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.033
- Where are we going?
- Toy store.

09:37.075 --> 09:38.736
- Yes!
- Kidding.

09:38.777 --> 09:40.711
We're getting you back home
and out of my hair.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.442
You're not my responsibility.

09:44.950 --> 09:47.043
Dude, come on.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.021
Not cool, dude.
Not cool.

09:54.059 --> 09:56.892
Hey, can we stop running?
I'm almost 30.

09:58.497 --> 10:02.558
So look, you're obviously
having some family issues.

10:02.601 --> 10:05.798
But whatever.
It's childhood. It ends.

10:05.837 --> 10:07.896
Don't look at me like that.
You fucked... you screwed up

10:07.939 --> 10:09.998
a very important meeting
for me back there.

10:10.042 --> 10:11.509
I think I've been
more than accommodating.

10:11.543 --> 10:13.170
Now come on.
We gotta get you home.

10:13.211 --> 10:14.769
Your mom's probably
worried sick about you.

10:14.813 --> 10:17.247
She's not my mom.

10:17.282 --> 10:19.773
That woman on the train...
that wasn't your mom?

10:21.453 --> 10:23.853
Were those your brothers
and sisters?

10:25.357 --> 10:27.825
So... where's your mom?

10:29.461 --> 10:32.624
Were you... what's going on?
Were you living with that woman?

10:35.067 --> 10:37.058
Like in foster care?

10:44.443 --> 10:46.570
Come on.

10:48.647 --> 10:50.638
- I'm thirsty.
- Yeah, I know.

10:50.682 --> 10:53.617
I'm taking you to the place
with the best water in the city.

10:58.623 --> 11:00.614
Stay here.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.092
Come here.
Come on.

11:11.136 --> 11:13.297
Come on.

11:15.540 --> 11:18.134
Good. Look cute.

11:18.176 --> 11:19.939
Cuter. Come on.

11:19.978 --> 11:22.173
There, that's it.

11:25.050 --> 11:28.918
Hey!
Sorry, that was loud.

11:28.954 --> 11:30.717
Didn't mean to scr...

11:30.755 --> 11:33.246
- are you guys open?
- No, not yet.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.885
Can, uh, he get
a glass of water?

11:35.927 --> 11:37.360
Yeah sure.

11:41.266 --> 11:44.793
- So who's this?
- He's my little brother.

11:44.836 --> 11:46.827
Not my actual brother.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.840
I'm his big brother like...

11:48.874 --> 11:51.570
like Big Brother, Big Sister
kind of thing, you know?

11:51.610 --> 11:54.010
- That's great. Good for you.
- Yeah yeah.

11:54.045 --> 11:56.479
Good deeds.
Good deeds.

11:56.515 --> 11:59.814
It's nice to know there are still
good men in the world.

11:59.851 --> 12:03.685
- They're hard to find.
- That's what Flannery said, right?

12:08.126 --> 12:10.788
- So, uh, what's your name?
- Mississippi.

12:10.829 --> 12:14.390
- That's your real name?
- It's what everyone calls me.

12:14.432 --> 12:16.059
I'm assuming it's also
where you're from?

12:16.101 --> 12:17.591
Yes, sir.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.501
Wow, what are the odds
of that, right?

12:21.206 --> 12:23.868
So great.
You're... you're here a lot?

12:23.909 --> 12:26.571
Sadly, yes.

12:26.611 --> 12:29.102
Okay, that's enough.
Say thank you for the water.

12:29.147 --> 12:31.615
- Thank you for the water.
- Oh, look at that.

12:31.650 --> 12:33.675
You're welcome.

12:33.718 --> 12:36.016
Great, so we're going to...
we gotta...

12:37.956 --> 12:41.357
But... come on.
It was great meeting you.

12:41.393 --> 12:44.328
I'll come back here
and, you know,

12:44.362 --> 12:47.354
drink your alcohol
at some point.

12:47.399 --> 12:49.799
- That'd be nice.
- Great.

12:51.436 --> 12:55.202
- I'm Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

13:10.155 --> 13:12.214
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

13:12.257 --> 13:14.157
All right.

13:14.192 --> 13:16.558
Let's get a little snack.

13:16.595 --> 13:18.897
Then we'll get you back home.

13:25.837 --> 13:29.000
#Hobos and tacos
and broken down Hondas... #

13:29.040 --> 13:31.702
- Why can't I stay here?
- You can't stay here.

13:31.743 --> 13:33.734
- Why not?
- Because you can't.

13:33.778 --> 13:36.406
- Why can't I?
- Because I said so.

13:36.448 --> 13:39.076
- I wanna stay here.
- You've made that very clear.

13:39.117 --> 13:40.141
You can't stay here.

13:40.185 --> 13:41.652
- Please?
- No.

13:41.686 --> 13:42.744
- Please?
- No.

13:42.787 --> 13:43.776
- Please?
- No.

13:43.822 --> 13:44.846
- Please?
- No.

13:44.889 --> 13:47.153
- I really wanna stay here.
- Ahh.

13:47.192 --> 13:48.955
- We'll have fun.
- I can't hear you.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.518
- Please?
- I can't hear you.

13:50.562 --> 13:51.859
- Please?
- I can't hear you.

13:51.896 --> 13:55.195
#Palm trees, exposed knees,
I punched Mickey Rourke #

13:55.233 --> 14:00.398
#But I miss New York. #

14:06.077 --> 14:08.045
Fuck!
Don't swear.

14:08.079 --> 14:09.910
Let's go.

14:14.452 --> 14:16.647
Look at the time.

14:16.688 --> 14:18.781
Oh, early meaning late.

14:18.823 --> 14:21.121
- I am so sorry.
- I forgive you. Get in here.

14:21.159 --> 14:23.252
Wait, this is Rasheen.

14:26.831 --> 14:28.822
Oh. Okay.

14:28.867 --> 14:32.303
- Hi, Rasheen. I'm Annie.
- Hi.

14:32.337 --> 14:34.202
You'll explain later?

14:34.239 --> 14:35.831
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.671
Oh, how was the meeting?

14:37.709 --> 14:40.837
Okay, we'll talk.
Go get drunk.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.870
None for the kid.

14:45.650 --> 14:48.210
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, what's up?

14:48.253 --> 14:50.153
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:54.092 --> 14:56.617
- Can I have a cookie?
- Dude, it's a party.

14:56.661 --> 14:58.754
You can have, like, 10 cookies.

14:58.797 --> 15:00.788
Go crazy.

15:04.135 --> 15:05.625
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:05.670 --> 15:08.332
- What the fuck?
- Come on. Child.

15:08.373 --> 15:10.364
Rasheen, this is my cousin
Mary Catherine.

15:10.408 --> 15:13.172
We're not really cousins.
Parents... best friends.

15:13.211 --> 15:16.408
Look, he's riveted.
What's going on?

15:16.448 --> 15:18.439
I'm just... you know,
I'm looking after him for a while.

15:18.483 --> 15:20.781
And you thought,
"I know what kids love...

15:20.819 --> 15:22.377
alopecia awareness parties."

15:22.420 --> 15:24.081
Kind of.
How are you?

15:24.122 --> 15:26.283
- Horrible.
- Nice. Where's Charlie?

15:26.324 --> 15:28.792
He's in LA.
He's back tomorrow.

15:28.827 --> 15:32.888
- I like that Charlie.
- So do I. I'm a mess without him.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.097
This is fishy. Why do you have
a small child with you, Sam?

15:37.135 --> 15:39.535
We're going to mingle.
It was great to see you.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.630
I'm calling you tomorrow.

15:45.677 --> 15:48.510
Okay, I promise
this won't take long.

15:48.546 --> 15:50.377
It's actually just
an excuse to get drunk

15:50.415 --> 15:52.280
with the people that I love.

15:52.317 --> 15:56.583
So as a little extra dash of fun,
whenever anyone says...

15:56.621 --> 15:59.215
oh I don't know..."follicle,"
we could all drink.

15:59.257 --> 16:01.157
Follicle!

16:03.928 --> 16:08.297
Okay, now the first thing

16:08.333 --> 16:11.325
most people notice about me
is that I am hot.

16:11.369 --> 16:14.497
- Whoo!
- Yes! That is correct.

16:14.539 --> 16:16.097
I am superhot.

16:16.141 --> 16:20.544
I am also, in addition
to being superdrunk, hairless.

16:20.578 --> 16:23.069
And unlike some of the hot
gay men here, I do not wax.

16:23.114 --> 16:25.480
I have a very awesome
autoimmune disorder

16:25.517 --> 16:29.317
that we're all going
to learn about right now.

16:29.354 --> 16:31.151
The word "alopecia"
comes from the Greek...

16:33.625 --> 16:36.287
Uh, could everyone please
turn off their cell phones?

16:36.327 --> 16:39.125
- I'm really sorry.
- What?

16:39.164 --> 16:40.961
- I am so so so sorry.
- What? That is so rude.

16:43.802 --> 16:45.827
I need a drink.
Follicle.

16:45.870 --> 16:48.031
Whoo!

16:48.072 --> 16:50.063
- Hey.
- Oh my God, baby,

16:50.108 --> 16:53.202
I wish you were here
with me right now.

16:53.244 --> 16:56.407
I got Dave's jeep
and I'm driving on the PCH

16:56.448 --> 16:58.746
and the sun is about to set.

16:58.783 --> 17:01.081
It is fucking unbelievable!

17:01.119 --> 17:03.747
- How's Dave doing?
- Dave is amazing!

17:03.788 --> 17:07.917
You know I haven't encountered
a single mosquito since I've been here?

17:07.959 --> 17:09.983
It's like a no-mosquito zone.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.893
They're outlawed or something.

17:11.930 --> 17:15.262
Charlie, come home right now.
I miss you.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.701
Huh? Oh, baby,
you're breaking up.

17:18.736 --> 17:22.398
Charlie? Charlie?

17:22.440 --> 17:24.839
No, one more fun fact.

17:24.876 --> 17:28.539
- Wait, is everyone having fun?
- Yeah! Whoo!

17:28.580 --> 17:30.775
...how much things cost.
- Every time.

17:30.815 --> 17:34.148
- Hey, thanks.
- Bye. Thanks for coming.

17:34.185 --> 17:36.779
- Great party.
- Mwah!

17:36.821 --> 17:38.311
I never noticed
you didn't have hair.

17:38.356 --> 17:40.551
- Really? I never mentioned it?
- No.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.719
- Love you.
- Love you too.

17:42.760 --> 17:46.890
#Remind me again
just what you were saying #

17:46.931 --> 17:50.833
#When you walked in the room
when the music was playing #

17:50.869 --> 17:53.064
#When I was lost too #

17:53.104 --> 17:57.837
#But in my own thoughts
and I could not find you #

17:59.143 --> 18:02.943
#Tell me your story,
I'm listening this time #

18:02.981 --> 18:04.972
- # I can get us some glasses... #
- Thanks.

18:05.016 --> 18:06.574
#And a bottle of wine #

18:06.618 --> 18:09.143
#We can sit on the carpet #

18:09.187 --> 18:14.454
#Sit on the table
or sit on the moon #

18:14.492 --> 18:18.622
#You can reach for my hand,
you can say what you like #

18:18.663 --> 18:21.530
#Or just what you can't stand #

18:21.566 --> 18:25.263
# Be a boy or a little old man... #

18:25.303 --> 18:27.362
#Be what you want,
even nothing... #

18:27.405 --> 18:29.100
Say cheese.

18:29.140 --> 18:31.074
Ah.

18:31.109 --> 18:32.906
Don't worry.
I'll destroy that.

18:32.944 --> 18:34.775
Here, let me try this.

18:34.812 --> 18:37.042
There.

18:38.783 --> 18:40.774
Did you have a rough night?

18:42.053 --> 18:43.645
I got a question.

18:43.688 --> 18:47.124
Um... why aren't we better friends?

18:49.561 --> 18:52.621
Um, I wasn't aware
we were friends.

18:52.664 --> 18:56.691
Oh, I... I think we would
get along really well.

18:56.734 --> 18:58.725
Well...

19:00.538 --> 19:05.339
my best friend's name
is Sam, Sam.

19:05.376 --> 19:10.211
I mean, seriously,
how many Sams

19:10.248 --> 19:11.875
can a girl have in her life?

19:11.916 --> 19:13.383
Well, you can call me Sam 2.

19:13.418 --> 19:16.114
Sounds like a sequel.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.349
"In a world of Sams,

19:18.389 --> 19:21.017
Sam 2 is so much better."

19:23.061 --> 19:26.053
Oh, that was cheesy.
May I?

19:40.545 --> 19:44.106
Help me out with
something here, Sam #2.

19:44.148 --> 19:47.709
- You work in legal, right?
- Yes, I do. Yes.

19:47.752 --> 19:50.915
- Seventh floor.
- Mm-hmm.

19:50.955 --> 19:54.083
Why are you always
lurking around down here?

19:54.125 --> 19:56.923
Oh, come on, everybody knows
the party's on five.

19:56.961 --> 20:00.362
Philanthropic giving!
Whoohoo!

20:03.668 --> 20:07.297
- Oh God.
- Oh.

20:07.338 --> 20:09.431
Can you...

20:09.474 --> 20:13.035
Oh, that's good.
That was a good one.

20:13.077 --> 20:15.705
One...

20:15.747 --> 20:18.238
Got it.

20:18.282 --> 20:20.018
Oh my God.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.911
Sorry.
Here, sit.

20:25.323 --> 20:27.587
Listen, they're going
to deal with you,

20:27.625 --> 20:30.458
get you back home
or wherever.

20:30.495 --> 20:32.292
If they ask any questions,

20:32.330 --> 20:35.231
um, just tell them you've been
walking around or something.

20:35.266 --> 20:37.632
You know, don't...
don't mention my name.

20:37.669 --> 20:41.127
I don't want to get
in any trouble.

20:41.172 --> 20:43.640
It was nice meeting you.

21:04.128 --> 21:06.653
So Dave thinks he's going to get
this thing off the ground.

21:06.698 --> 21:09.360
- That's great.
- Yeah.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.130
He was the happiest
I've seen him in a long time.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.832
LA seems to agree with him.

21:14.872 --> 21:17.067
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:19.677 --> 21:22.976
He says he doesn't
miss New York at all.

21:23.014 --> 21:24.845
I knew he'd bail.

21:24.882 --> 21:27.976
He was always way too much of a wimp
to stay here forever.

21:28.019 --> 21:30.010
- Do you want to know what I want?
- Hmm?

21:30.054 --> 21:33.922
- An omelet.
- Oh, wait. I'm just curious.

21:33.958 --> 21:38.224
Why do you hate
Los Angeles so much?

21:38.262 --> 21:40.526
Because it's the epicenter
of all that is awful.

21:43.067 --> 21:45.467
- Wait.
- Feed me.

21:45.503 --> 21:48.472
Dave told me this awesome thing
about LA. No, listen.

21:48.506 --> 21:51.669
He says the whole town
is like this blank canvas,

21:51.709 --> 21:55.668
and whatever you bring to it...
that's what it is.

21:55.713 --> 21:58.978
It's just this random collection
of neighborhoods where it's always sunny

21:59.016 --> 22:02.975
and it basically reflects
wherever you're at back at you.

22:03.020 --> 22:05.454
So if you're happy, LA is great.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.515
If you're not, LA sucks.

22:07.558 --> 22:10.026
But it has nothing to do
with Los Angeles

22:10.061 --> 22:12.962
because... get this...

22:12.997 --> 22:15.192
there's no such thing.

22:17.368 --> 22:19.859
And?

22:19.904 --> 22:22.031
And that's it.

22:23.841 --> 22:28.175
If you don't feed me soon,
I'm going to eat your face.

22:28.212 --> 22:30.203
Let's go.

22:39.157 --> 22:42.957
Okay, what's going on?

22:42.994 --> 22:45.360
Dave said what?

22:45.396 --> 22:50.265
He wants to partner
with me, 50/50.

22:50.301 --> 22:53.395
But...

22:53.437 --> 22:57.237
we'd have to be out there.

22:58.643 --> 23:00.873
When?

23:00.912 --> 23:03.972
End of the month.

23:04.015 --> 23:06.006
And you want to do it?

23:31.509 --> 23:36.446
What I'm missing, I think,
is a great subject.

23:36.480 --> 23:40.473
Like... like the novel,
that which is new, you know?

23:40.518 --> 23:44.284
Where's my...
what do I draw upon?

23:45.456 --> 23:47.856
- I don't know.
- Exactly.

23:47.892 --> 23:49.951
I mean my great shame
as a writer

23:49.994 --> 23:53.657
is that I'm just this suburban kid
with good parents.

23:53.698 --> 23:57.395
You know,
I was fed, clothed,

23:57.435 --> 24:00.427
carpooled...
hardly Dickensian.

24:00.471 --> 24:02.939
- You know what I'm saying?
- Totally.

24:02.974 --> 24:05.568
I mean you...
with your situation...

24:05.610 --> 24:07.100
That's a gold mine.

24:07.144 --> 24:09.840
You got, like, tons of material

24:09.881 --> 24:13.442
all at the ripe old age
of whatever.

24:13.484 --> 24:16.351
How old are you anyway?

24:16.387 --> 24:18.787
I don't know.

24:18.823 --> 24:20.484
You don't know how old you are?

24:23.094 --> 24:25.255
When's your birthday?

24:39.810 --> 24:41.641
What are you so afraid of?

24:43.281 --> 24:46.409
I'm afraid my brain
is going to melt.

24:46.450 --> 24:49.476
I'm afraid we will never
walk anywhere ever again.

24:49.520 --> 24:53.115
I'm afraid we won't care
about things anymore

24:53.157 --> 24:56.558
except opening
weekend grosses

24:56.594 --> 24:59.324
and Pilates classes.

24:59.363 --> 25:02.855
Yeah, but you know they'd be,
like, the best Pilates classes.

25:02.900 --> 25:05.061
There's no art there.

25:05.102 --> 25:07.400
- That's ridiculous.
- They have no culture.

25:07.438 --> 25:09.269
New York has everything...

25:09.307 --> 25:12.538
the best restaurants,
best theater, museums...

25:12.576 --> 25:15.374
Right, and how many museums
do you go to in an average week?

25:15.413 --> 25:17.040
- I'm just curious.
- That is not the point.

25:17.081 --> 25:18.446
- Yes, that is the point.
- Not the point.

25:18.482 --> 25:19.972
I mean, what good is paying
out the nose to live here

25:20.017 --> 25:21.609
if we never
take advantage of it?

25:21.652 --> 25:24.314
We might as well live somewhere else
and just visit every once in a while

25:24.355 --> 25:25.845
and actually do things.

25:25.890 --> 25:28.484
You know, hit the Met,
take in a Broadway show,

25:28.526 --> 25:30.255
Carnegie Deli.

25:30.294 --> 25:32.694
"Wow, that's a really big sandwich.

25:32.730 --> 25:35.130
- I don't know if I can eat all that."
- I love New York.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.724
You're miserable more than not.

25:36.767 --> 25:39.827
Yes, but that is not
New York's fault.

25:42.907 --> 25:44.898
New York is...

25:46.444 --> 25:48.435
What?

25:50.815 --> 25:53.215
...home.

25:53.250 --> 25:55.514
You're asking me to leave home.

26:06.097 --> 26:07.758
You know this is my job,
don't you?

26:07.798 --> 26:09.493
I have to sit here and write things.

26:09.533 --> 26:11.933
It's... it's not easy
with you staring at me.

26:23.247 --> 26:26.045
Sorry I don't have a television.

26:27.351 --> 26:28.841
What's your thing?
What do you like?

26:28.886 --> 26:31.286
You like art, huh?
You like to draw?

26:31.322 --> 26:33.654
Really?

26:35.359 --> 26:38.294
Here, draw yourself a television.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.932
#So I have under two minutes
to sing you this song #

26:52.977 --> 26:56.003
#It's quite the challenge actually
because I've loved you so long #

26:56.047 --> 26:58.948
#And I know I'm always writing
so you think I'm good with words #

26:58.983 --> 27:02.077
#But I can hardly express
how I feel #

27:02.119 --> 27:05.020
#'Cause words aren't why
love is real #

27:05.056 --> 27:09.015
#And I don't know why
I love you, I just do #

27:10.561 --> 27:13.621
#There was a message in a bottle
at the bottom of the sea #

27:13.664 --> 27:16.758
#Somebody mistook rock
for paper accidenta-dentally #

27:16.801 --> 27:19.668
#So their letter never made it
to the lover they adore #

27:19.703 --> 27:22.672
#I had to fish it
from the ocean floor #

27:22.706 --> 27:25.800
#And I know you won't believe me,
but I swear to God it's true #

27:25.843 --> 27:28.607
#The letter said "I love you,
but I don't know why I do" #

27:28.646 --> 27:31.706
#That's exactly when it hit me,
that's exactly how I feel #

27:31.749 --> 27:35.048
#'Cause though
my love is real... #

27:35.086 --> 27:36.815
Amazing, right?

27:36.854 --> 27:38.378
Are you sure
you don't like these

27:38.422 --> 27:40.287
just because they're
a lot of pictures of you?

27:40.324 --> 27:41.814
No.

27:41.859 --> 27:45.226
But I do look
incredibly handsome

27:45.262 --> 27:46.786
in this one.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.389
Look at me.

27:48.432 --> 27:50.662
I'm like a dashing
Russian aristocrat.

27:50.701 --> 27:52.328
Oh.

27:54.038 --> 27:55.869
What do you think
was going on?

27:55.906 --> 27:57.931
I don't know.
Something bad.

27:57.975 --> 28:00.409
He says he won't go back.

28:01.512 --> 28:05.278
Well, he's supercute.
I say we keep him.

28:05.316 --> 28:07.807
I'm kidding.
We can't keep him.

28:07.852 --> 28:10.980
- Sam, don't keep him.
- I'm not keeping him.

28:11.021 --> 28:13.012
Calm down.

28:24.101 --> 28:27.434
Sorry about the ball.
It's all I got.

28:40.084 --> 28:42.075
Hello?

28:45.389 --> 28:47.653
Okay.

28:47.691 --> 28:50.091
No, it's not like I didn't
see this one coming.

28:51.962 --> 28:54.328
So that's the last of them, huh?

28:56.500 --> 29:00.732
No, I'm, uh... I'm fine.
Thanks.

29:19.390 --> 29:22.450
Did you know that my three
most financially successful years

29:22.493 --> 29:25.087
in New York City
were when I was dealing pot?

29:27.431 --> 29:29.899
You don't need Dave
or some crappy town

29:29.934 --> 29:31.424
to do something great.

29:31.468 --> 29:35.302
- I believe in you.
- Why?

29:35.339 --> 29:37.967
'Cause you're my man.

29:38.008 --> 29:41.569
You're my big, funny,
floppy-haired man.

29:42.680 --> 29:46.480
We don't need to know everything
in advance, okay?

29:46.517 --> 29:50.886
You'll figure out your thing
and we'll have money eventually.

29:50.921 --> 29:52.411
That's how it works.

29:52.456 --> 29:54.856
No, not here.

29:54.892 --> 29:56.587
Not always.

29:58.729 --> 30:02.358
I just want to feel like the crap
I put myself through is...

30:05.369 --> 30:07.200
I don't know.

30:07.238 --> 30:09.297
No no, yeah, I did.
I called him yesterday.

30:11.242 --> 30:13.403
I'm just tired.

30:23.554 --> 30:26.352
- Oh.
- Sorry.

30:26.390 --> 30:29.689
So I'm... I'm generally not
a happy hour kind of guy,

30:29.727 --> 30:33.424
- but I thought you might like...
- Oh, uh, yeah sorry. I can't.

30:33.464 --> 30:35.125
- It's a school night.
- Oh, yeah.

30:35.165 --> 30:37.156
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

30:37.201 --> 30:40.466
Oh. Two ships, two ships.

30:40.504 --> 30:42.665
- Hey, Beth.
- Hey.

31:38.562 --> 31:41.292
- What?
- What do you mean?

31:41.332 --> 31:43.027
Why did you want
to see me so bad?

31:43.067 --> 31:45.058
I just... does there have
to be a reason?

31:47.271 --> 31:49.136
I don't know.

31:49.173 --> 31:51.107
I still...

31:53.477 --> 31:55.536
Whatever.
It's just been a while.

31:55.579 --> 31:58.912
Have a drink with me.
Please?

32:28.379 --> 32:29.368
- She hated me.
- Not true.

32:29.413 --> 32:31.313
- She hated me.
- She didn't hate you.

32:31.348 --> 32:33.043
She just thought
you needed a haircut.

32:33.083 --> 32:35.142
Yeah well, I couldn't have been
nicer to that woman.

32:35.185 --> 32:39.485
I... I brought her flowers.
I even tucked my shirt in.

32:39.523 --> 32:41.957
Wow, shocking that
that didn't win her over.

32:41.992 --> 32:44.222
- Nothing would have.
- I'm her daughter.

32:44.261 --> 32:45.853
She didn't want me to get hurt.

32:45.896 --> 32:48.456
But I guess in fairness, you know,
she was wrong about you.

32:48.499 --> 32:51.024
Oh no, wait.
She was totally right.

32:51.068 --> 32:54.401
- Come on.
- Mothers are always right.

32:54.438 --> 32:56.099
I fuckin' hate that.

32:58.942 --> 33:02.969
I can handle your mother
hating me.

33:03.013 --> 33:05.447
I can't stand the thought
that you hate me.

33:17.528 --> 33:20.497
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:20.531 --> 33:23.694
- You're back.
- A man of my word.

33:23.734 --> 33:25.725
- Mississippi.
- Sam.

33:25.769 --> 33:31.537
- M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I?
- Very good.

33:31.575 --> 33:33.805
- How's your little brother?
- Who?

33:33.844 --> 33:35.937
- The kid?
- Oh, good.

33:35.979 --> 33:37.469
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
He's good.

33:37.514 --> 33:38.674
Well, it's great that you do that.

33:38.715 --> 33:41.377
You know, you're...
you're really good at your job.

33:41.418 --> 33:43.318
- Am I?
- Yeah, I've been...

33:43.353 --> 33:45.344
I've been watching you
do your thing.

33:45.389 --> 33:47.857
- You're good.
- Wow.

33:47.891 --> 33:50.121
I must be a really good actress

33:50.160 --> 33:52.424
because I fucking hate my job.

33:52.463 --> 33:54.124
- You're an actress?
- No.

33:54.164 --> 33:55.392
What do you do
when you're not here?

33:55.432 --> 33:57.730
- I sing.
- Sing? Songs?

33:57.768 --> 34:01.636
- Yeah, songs. Cabaret.
- Ah.

34:01.672 --> 34:03.936
- What do you do?
- I write.

34:03.974 --> 34:07.000
- Words?
- Yeah, words.

34:09.246 --> 34:11.271
So you sing.
Are you... you any good?

34:11.315 --> 34:13.612
Well, you come listen
and then tell me.

34:13.650 --> 34:16.083
No, I... I could never
come hear you sing.

34:16.119 --> 34:19.246
- Why not?
- Because I like you.

34:19.289 --> 34:20.880
That makes no sense.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.127
You happy to see me?

34:32.168 --> 34:34.159
I don't know yet.

34:44.848 --> 34:46.907
This is bad.

34:46.949 --> 34:49.214
I have to work in the morning.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.949
- Some people work.
- Hey, I work.

34:51.989 --> 34:54.753
Playing bass in a shitty band

34:54.791 --> 34:58.318
and considering applying
to grad school is not a job.

34:58.362 --> 35:00.023
You think the band is shitty?

35:02.266 --> 35:04.734
Well, you were front row
at every show.

35:04.768 --> 35:06.759
I was your girlfriend.

35:06.803 --> 35:10.762
That, like, contractually obligated me
to be a groupie.

35:10.807 --> 35:14.402
Yeah, but you always...

35:14.444 --> 35:17.538
you just looked like you were
enjoying yourself, that's all.

35:24.555 --> 35:27.456
I was.

35:27.491 --> 35:29.482
I did.

35:34.965 --> 35:37.433
All right, let's do this.
Tell me things.

35:37.467 --> 35:40.163
When, Mississippi,
did you leave Mississippi

35:40.203 --> 35:41.534
and come to New York City?

35:41.572 --> 35:43.096
- When I was 17.
- Oh great.

35:43.140 --> 35:44.732
So you've been here,
what, two years?

35:44.775 --> 35:48.006
- Aw, nice.
- Ooh wait, where's your accent?

35:48.045 --> 35:49.603
Oh, it's here...

35:49.646 --> 35:51.876
when I need it.

35:51.915 --> 35:53.212
Drink this.

35:53.250 --> 35:56.117
Yes, ma'am.
Cheers.

35:56.153 --> 35:58.144
Mm!

35:58.188 --> 35:59.849
What the fuck, man?

35:59.890 --> 36:01.653
Why won't you come
hear me sing?

36:01.692 --> 36:04.183
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

36:04.227 --> 36:06.127
Because I once dated
this girl in college

36:06.163 --> 36:07.653
who desperately wanted
to be an actress.

36:07.698 --> 36:09.222
I mean it was all she talked about.

36:09.266 --> 36:12.326
And I finally went
to see her in this play.

36:12.369 --> 36:13.529
Bad?

36:13.570 --> 36:17.438
So unburdened with talent
it was amazing.

36:17.474 --> 36:20.534
- I mean I had to break up with her.
- Because she was a bad actress?

36:20.577 --> 36:22.067
No, I didn't care
if she was good or not.

36:22.112 --> 36:24.740
It was... she so believed she was good
and it made me feel like,

36:24.781 --> 36:28.478
wow, this girl doesn't
know herself at all.

36:28.518 --> 36:31.646
And I think you're terrific.
I do.

36:31.688 --> 36:33.178
Therefore, I could never
come hear you sing

36:33.223 --> 36:35.157
because it'll change everything
if I learn you can't.

36:35.192 --> 36:37.023
- What if I'm amazing?
- What if you aren't?

36:37.060 --> 36:39.392
- What if you suck as a writer?
- I don't.

36:39.429 --> 36:43.365
Whoa, you are bad news.

36:49.873 --> 36:53.365
Sammy, I'm calling you
because you're my sponsor

36:53.410 --> 36:55.605
and I'm about to fall
off the wagon.

36:55.646 --> 36:58.581
It happens, right?
Don't be mad.

36:58.615 --> 37:00.776
Okay, I'm going to take
your not picking up to mean

37:00.817 --> 37:03.012
that the universe wants me
to fuck up badly right now.

37:03.053 --> 37:05.453
I'll call you tomorrow
and confess.

37:17.167 --> 37:19.158
Fuck!

37:36.787 --> 37:38.448
What's wrong?

37:38.488 --> 37:42.891
- I got bad news today.
- What?

37:42.926 --> 37:45.588
I'm a fuckin' failure.

37:45.629 --> 37:47.290
Aw.

37:47.330 --> 37:51.061
Fuck, I was impressive once.

37:51.101 --> 37:53.763
I'm telling you,

37:53.804 --> 37:56.898
parent-teacher conferences
back in the day...

37:56.940 --> 37:58.931
I was unstoppable.

37:58.975 --> 38:01.273
- Little Sammy Wexler.
- I'll bet you were.

38:01.311 --> 38:02.801
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:13.090 --> 38:15.320
It's okay to not
say anything, right?

38:15.358 --> 38:19.192
I always want to...
I always want to talk.

38:19.229 --> 38:22.858
I don't always have to be talking.

38:25.335 --> 38:27.599
You gotta stop me
because I'm just gonna keep...

38:27.637 --> 38:30.970
I'm just gonna keep going.
I don't know how those things...

38:47.524 --> 38:50.425
Shh.

38:59.202 --> 39:01.193
This way. Come.

39:01.238 --> 39:02.728
Wait wait, shh!

39:02.773 --> 39:05.606
Listen, there might be
a small black child

39:05.642 --> 39:07.405
sleeping on my couch,
so we have to be quiet.

39:07.444 --> 39:08.934
Might?

39:08.979 --> 39:10.469
There's definitely
a small black child

39:10.514 --> 39:12.038
sleeping on my couch,
so we have to be quiet.

39:12.082 --> 39:14.380
Okay.

39:14.417 --> 39:16.749
Shh shh!

39:16.787 --> 39:19.187
- Look look, it's my bedroom.
- Oh.

39:19.222 --> 39:21.952
- How nice is it in here?
- Amazing.

39:25.662 --> 39:28.460
- Hey.
- Hey. What?

39:28.498 --> 39:31.058
- I'm not going to sleep with you.
- Sure you are.

39:31.101 --> 39:35.060
- No, I can't.
- Come on, that's defeatist.

39:35.105 --> 39:37.232
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

39:37.274 --> 39:39.242
Ow!

39:39.276 --> 39:40.834
- Shh!
- Ah.

39:40.877 --> 39:43.539
- The children.
- Oh.

39:44.748 --> 39:47.581
- Does he stay with you a lot?
- Well, occasionally.

39:47.617 --> 39:50.950
You know, rough home life.

39:50.987 --> 39:53.922
Sam, I'm serious.
I'm not going to sleep with you.

39:55.492 --> 39:57.255
Does this have something
to do with Jesus?

39:57.294 --> 40:00.195
- Is that what this is?
- No.

40:00.230 --> 40:03.358
- I made a New Year's resolution.
- To what?

40:03.400 --> 40:05.960
To not be such a whore.

40:06.002 --> 40:08.562
How's that been going for you?

40:08.605 --> 40:10.630
Well...

40:10.674 --> 40:13.108
- Come on.
- No no no no, I barely know you.

40:13.143 --> 40:15.703
All I know is you've got all these
sort of idiotic theories, okay?

40:15.745 --> 40:18.407
I'm not going to spend
the night with you.

40:18.448 --> 40:21.417
Okay, fine. I don't...

40:21.451 --> 40:23.442
I don't think you should spend
the night with me either.

40:23.486 --> 40:26.421
You don't?

40:26.456 --> 40:28.924
I think you should spend
the next three nights with me.

40:28.959 --> 40:32.656
- What?
- I'm serious!

40:32.696 --> 40:34.527
Stay with me.
Three days.

40:34.564 --> 40:36.828
I've got an extra set of keys.
You come and go as you please.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.165
I knew that last shot
was a bad idea.

40:39.202 --> 40:41.261
What? Come on.
This will be awesome.

40:41.304 --> 40:45.570
Look, I totally agree...
one-night stands are the worst.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.600
So you want to have
a three-night stand?

40:47.644 --> 40:48.804
Yeah.

40:48.845 --> 40:50.403
What is this,
like your line or something?

40:50.447 --> 40:52.176
No.

40:52.215 --> 40:54.581
You've said that
to other girls before!

40:54.618 --> 40:57.746
I've never even thought this before,
but it's totally genius, isn't it?

40:57.787 --> 41:00.517
No, it's like the worst idea ever.

41:00.557 --> 41:03.993
Hey hey hey, you stay here
for three days.

41:04.027 --> 41:06.154
Who knows what could happen?

41:06.196 --> 41:07.788
We sleep together once...
let's be honest,

41:07.831 --> 41:09.992
the odds are I'm never
gonna call you.

41:10.033 --> 41:12.024
You just said that out loud.

41:12.068 --> 41:14.229
Come on. Come on!

41:14.271 --> 41:16.671
- No way.
- Move in with me for three days.

41:16.706 --> 41:19.197
My mother warned me
about guys like you.

41:19.242 --> 41:23.144
Seriously.
It'll be an adventure, huh?

41:23.179 --> 41:25.010
We'll cook.

41:25.048 --> 41:27.642
We'll make
obscene amounts of love.

41:27.684 --> 41:29.811
We'll play with the adorable kid
on the couch

41:29.853 --> 41:32.151
out there in the living room.

41:32.188 --> 41:34.748
Is this for real?

41:34.791 --> 41:36.918
- Yeah.
- We just met.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.656
- Isn't it going to be awkward?
- Yeah.

41:41.331 --> 41:44.698
This is... you're not going
to want me here for three days.

41:44.734 --> 41:47.032
Yes, I will. I do.
I wouldn't be asking you if I didn't.

41:47.070 --> 41:48.628
Yeah, now you do
because you're drunk.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.264
Are you going to be drunk
for three days?

41:50.307 --> 41:52.741
- Possibly.
- You're crazy.

41:52.776 --> 41:54.403
You're going to move in
with me for three days.

41:54.444 --> 41:56.742
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

41:56.780 --> 41:58.680
Making it official.

41:58.715 --> 42:01.240
Paperwork. Terms.

42:01.284 --> 42:03.343
Hey.

42:03.386 --> 42:04.910
I don't get to weigh in
on the terms?

42:08.124 --> 42:11.787
Okay, fine.
What are your terms?

42:11.828 --> 42:15.559
If I'm going to stay here
with you for three days

42:15.598 --> 42:18.396
I need you to be nice.

42:18.435 --> 42:21.199
Okay.

42:21.237 --> 42:23.228
But I'm going to need you
to be naked.

42:25.875 --> 42:28.673
Sam...

42:28.712 --> 42:31.738
I've been feeling
a little fragile these days.

42:33.049 --> 42:35.210
I need you to be nice.

42:38.855 --> 42:40.846
Okay.

42:44.995 --> 42:46.986
Sign it.

43:03.113 --> 43:05.911
#By the time you get
the postcard #

43:05.949 --> 43:09.441
#I'll say I didn't mean
the things I said #

43:09.486 --> 43:12.011
#The time you wanna
touch me #

43:12.055 --> 43:16.754
#I'll say I didn't really read
the books I said I read #

43:16.793 --> 43:20.126
#Go ahead, ring the doorbell,
I'll answer the door #

43:20.163 --> 43:22.495
# But what do you wanna talk... #

43:22.532 --> 43:24.022
#To me... #

43:24.067 --> 43:27.400
#40 hours ago
I was feelin' one way #

43:27.437 --> 43:30.497
#Now I'm feeling another #

43:30.540 --> 43:34.840
#Is there supposed to be
one thing to latch onto? #

43:34.878 --> 43:39.542
#I'm feelin' echo and blue
silhouettes upon my shoe #

43:39.582 --> 43:42.449
#Of the person
I once really knew... #

43:42.485 --> 43:44.544
Hey.

43:44.587 --> 43:47.055
We should do this again
sometime.

43:47.090 --> 43:51.356
- You think?
- Yeah, like a lot.

43:51.394 --> 43:54.557
Yeah, 'cause that always
works out great.

43:54.597 --> 43:56.360
Come on.

43:56.399 --> 43:58.833
Ira, why would I torture myself?

43:58.868 --> 44:01.598
- Come here.
- I have to go.

44:01.638 --> 44:05.233
You can be 45 seconds
late for work.

44:23.827 --> 44:27.524
You're worried you're going
to get hurt, right?

44:27.564 --> 44:30.965
But aren't we past all that?
We're great together.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.025
We should just...

44:35.004 --> 44:38.303
It's a bad idea.

44:38.341 --> 44:41.276
Look...

44:41.311 --> 44:43.745
I'm kind of seeing someone

44:43.780 --> 44:48.410
which I...
I think makes this safe

44:48.451 --> 44:52.182
because we can't get too into it,
which was the problem last time.

44:52.222 --> 44:54.452
But we're not exclusive,

44:54.491 --> 44:59.087
so you and I can still,
you know, whatever.

45:02.699 --> 45:04.963
Ann.

45:08.671 --> 45:11.401
Always making me the bad guy.

45:27.991 --> 45:29.959
5206?

45:29.993 --> 45:32.587
5208.

45:32.629 --> 45:34.529
- Damn it.
- What?

45:34.564 --> 45:36.896
I thought I had
another set of keys.

45:36.933 --> 45:38.958
- Are you working tonight?
- I'm singing.

45:39.002 --> 45:43.132
- Oh great. Where?
- I go on at 10:00.

45:43.173 --> 45:45.164
What time are you done?

45:47.477 --> 45:48.466
Okay, great.

45:48.511 --> 45:52.208
So, um, I gotta get some keys made
and I'll call you after.

45:55.418 --> 45:58.182
- Bye.
- Bye.

46:10.967 --> 46:13.060
Hey.

46:13.102 --> 46:15.570
- Did that girl leave?
- Yeah.

46:20.643 --> 46:24.943
- Did she say anything?
- Nope.

46:24.981 --> 46:26.471
You like French toast?

46:26.516 --> 46:28.074
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

46:28.117 --> 46:30.950
All right, let's make some.
Come on.

46:30.987 --> 46:33.285
We'll get all Kramer v. Kramer.

46:45.501 --> 46:47.731
Hey.

46:47.770 --> 46:49.863
You okay?

46:49.906 --> 46:52.033
Yeah, totally.

46:52.075 --> 46:54.202
Can I, uh... can I...
can I do anything for you?

46:54.244 --> 46:55.939
Nope.

46:57.113 --> 46:59.411
- Weren't you wearing that yesterday?
- Please go away.

46:59.449 --> 47:01.644
Sure, yeah.

47:03.219 --> 47:07.713
Ugh! He's a fucking 29-year-old
12-year-old.

47:07.757 --> 47:09.554
That's what he is.
That's all I meet.

47:09.592 --> 47:13.494
If there's a 29-year-old 12-year-old
within 100' of me,

47:13.529 --> 47:16.987
I will find that motherfucker
and I will sleep with him.

47:17.033 --> 47:18.967
It's my one gift.

47:19.002 --> 47:22.631
And they never call.
They just text... all of them!

47:22.672 --> 47:24.799
"Hey, what's going on?
I haven't seen you in a while.

47:24.841 --> 47:28.299
You wanna come over and fuck?"
"Well, fuck you!"

47:36.219 --> 47:38.483
I'm so sick of optimism.

47:38.521 --> 47:41.422
It's fucking exhausting.

47:43.526 --> 47:45.016
Listen.

47:47.397 --> 47:50.855
Why do you give a shit
what people like Ira think of you?

47:50.900 --> 47:52.765
Ira...

47:52.802 --> 47:54.565
You should give a shit
what people like me think of you.

47:54.604 --> 47:58.096
And I think you're one of the greats.
I always have.

47:58.141 --> 48:00.439
Everyone who loves you
thinks that, okay?

48:00.476 --> 48:02.000
- Okay?
- I love you, Sam.

48:02.045 --> 48:05.037
Are you listening to me?
I love you too.

48:05.081 --> 48:09.074
- Now get out there and...
- Oh. And get 'em.

48:09.118 --> 48:11.177
...philanthropic give.

48:14.057 --> 48:16.753
That was an uplifting lunch hour.

48:18.294 --> 48:20.421
We're dealing
with the kid thing tonight.

48:20.463 --> 48:23.921
- This is getting ridiculous.
- Okay.

48:23.966 --> 48:27.060
Hey, Ann.

48:27.103 --> 48:30.732
You don't have to
keep it together all the time.

48:30.773 --> 48:35.904
Yeah, the world will love a bald girl
who can't stop crying.

48:38.614 --> 48:40.717
Bye.

48:48.524 --> 48:50.651
You know, I'm not crazy
about that shirt.

48:50.693 --> 48:53.093
- Why?
- I'm your boyfriend.

48:53.129 --> 48:55.791
That makes me down.
I don't want to be down.

48:55.832 --> 48:59.268
- It's not about you.
- Who else are you dating?

48:59.302 --> 49:02.271
It's just nothing.
Who cares?

49:05.208 --> 49:07.301
Yeah well, what about the one
that says "I love nerds"?

49:07.343 --> 49:09.641
- I do love nerds.
- Well, it makes me feel weird.

49:09.679 --> 49:12.580
Well, Chuck, if you find
the "My man's a hot stud" t-shirt,

49:12.615 --> 49:15.083
Christmas is right around
the corner.

49:15.118 --> 49:18.554
I just don't know what you're trying
to announce, that's all.

49:23.659 --> 49:25.593
That's perfect.

49:25.628 --> 49:28.597
Are you going to throw a jacket
down over that or what?

49:30.633 --> 49:32.931
Grumpy.

49:34.404 --> 49:37.567
Okay, this... awesome.

49:37.607 --> 49:39.871
And you know the Clash?

49:39.909 --> 49:42.036
Dude, you don't know
the Clash?

49:42.078 --> 49:44.979
I have so much to teach you.

49:54.290 --> 49:56.588
Hi, Sam.
It's Mississippi.

49:56.626 --> 50:00.153
Remember me?
The girl from last night?

50:00.196 --> 50:05.293
Um, just wanted to remind you
I go on at 10:00 tonight.

50:05.334 --> 50:07.894
I... I promise not to suck.

50:07.937 --> 50:10.497
No pressure.

50:10.540 --> 50:12.974
I never heard from you
about the keys, so...

50:13.009 --> 50:16.172
I don't know.
I'll see you later, I guess.

50:16.212 --> 50:18.009
Okay, bye.

50:22.218 --> 50:24.618
#What are you so afraid of? #

50:24.654 --> 50:27.020
#Why are you feeling scared? #

50:27.056 --> 50:30.355
#What's the worst
that's gonna happen? #

50:32.562 --> 50:34.928
#Standing in the moonlight #

50:34.964 --> 50:39.867
#I can tell you feel doomed
though nothing is wrong #

50:39.902 --> 50:42.234
#No, nothing #

50:42.271 --> 50:48.073
#You say maybe a crane
will fall from the sky #

50:48.110 --> 50:52.570
#Maybe a dove will dive #

50:52.615 --> 50:59.487
#And die before your eye #

51:03.292 --> 51:05.783
#It's too early to say #

51:05.828 --> 51:10.231
#It's too early
to say good night #

51:10.266 --> 51:13.258
#Good night #

51:13.302 --> 51:15.702
#It's too early to read #

51:15.738 --> 51:21.734
#It's too early to read
by the firelight #

51:25.515 --> 51:27.813
#What are you so afraid of? #

51:27.850 --> 51:30.080
#Why are you feeling scared? #

51:30.119 --> 51:33.316
#What's the worst
that's gonna happen? #

51:35.358 --> 51:39.818
#Standing in the meadow
with sunlight in your eye #

51:39.862 --> 51:44.822
#And a sense
of so much sorrow #

51:44.867 --> 51:50.464
#You say maybe a plane
will fall from the sky #

51:50.506 --> 51:54.875
#Maybe a lover will lie #

51:54.911 --> 52:01.908
#And die before your eye #

52:05.521 --> 52:08.081
#It's too early to say #

52:08.124 --> 52:12.254
#It's too early
to say good night #

52:12.295 --> 52:15.389
#Good night #

52:15.431 --> 52:17.490
#It's too early to read #

52:17.533 --> 52:23.768
#It's too early to read
by the firelight #

52:25.308 --> 52:27.776
#It's too early to say #

52:27.810 --> 52:32.008
#It's too early
to say good night #

52:32.048 --> 52:35.040
#Good night #

52:35.084 --> 52:37.450
#It's too early to read #

52:37.486 --> 52:43.721
#It's too early to read
by the firelight. #

53:00.710 --> 53:03.508
Hi.

53:03.546 --> 53:05.537
Hi.

53:07.950 --> 53:10.214
I'm here.

53:10.252 --> 53:13.710
I can see that.

53:13.756 --> 53:16.850
I don't know why exactly.

53:16.892 --> 53:19.156
You didn't want to get sued.

53:19.195 --> 53:21.220
Right?

53:24.300 --> 53:27.133
Oh.

53:27.169 --> 53:30.366
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:34.644 --> 53:37.044
So I just had a little talk
with Rasheen.

53:38.514 --> 53:40.243
I asked about you being
his big brother.

53:40.282 --> 53:41.977
He had no idea
what I was talking about.

53:42.018 --> 53:44.145
Okay. Okay, wait.

53:44.186 --> 53:47.587
He said you met on the subway.
What the fuck is going on?

53:47.623 --> 53:49.215
Hold... hold... hold... hold on.
Hold on.

53:49.258 --> 53:51.283
- Just wait.
- Who is he? Why is he here?

53:51.327 --> 53:55.058
He got separated from his...
he had nowhere else to go.

53:55.097 --> 53:56.428
- How old is he?
- I don't know.

53:56.465 --> 53:59.263
- He doesn't know either.
- And...

53:59.301 --> 54:00.791
oh my God,
do you like little boys?

54:00.836 --> 54:03.896
What? No!
He's... he's in foster care, okay?

54:03.939 --> 54:05.873
He's been in seven
foster homes in his life.

54:05.908 --> 54:08.809
I... I think something was going on.
He says he won't go back.

54:08.844 --> 54:11.404
- Why didn't you go to the police?
- I did!

54:11.447 --> 54:13.608
Look, I... I realize
I'm in some trouble here,

54:13.649 --> 54:14.741
but I don't know what else to do.

54:14.784 --> 54:17.651
I'm just... I'm letting him stay here
until I can figure something out.

54:17.687 --> 54:21.145
- How long has he been here?
- Three, four days.

54:21.190 --> 54:25.684
You find a child on the subway
and you think you can just...

54:25.728 --> 54:28.162
just keep him here without letting
anyone know where he is?

54:28.197 --> 54:30.256
- That's...
- And you left him here

54:30.299 --> 54:31.789
while you were out
the other night.

54:31.834 --> 54:34.234
No, he was fine.
I... I put on some Leonard Cohen.

54:34.270 --> 54:36.261
He just knocked him right out.

54:38.741 --> 54:41.471
I have the worst taste in men.

54:49.452 --> 54:50.942
Sorry.

54:57.359 --> 55:01.090
Hold on.
I have some, uh...

55:01.130 --> 55:02.495
It's okay, honey.

55:04.400 --> 55:07.392
Hey, um, can you...

55:07.436 --> 55:09.495
I'm not good with blood.

55:12.074 --> 55:13.939
Congratulations, Sam.

55:13.976 --> 55:17.605
You've just become the most
unattractive man in the world.

56:15.070 --> 56:18.301
Hey. Hey hey hey.

56:18.340 --> 56:19.898
- You're really leaving?
- Yeah.

56:19.942 --> 56:21.432
- Why?
- I'm not a babysitter.

56:21.477 --> 56:24.378
- He's totally mellow. You...
- I was talking about you.

56:26.982 --> 56:29.542
You have to let someone
know where he is.

56:29.585 --> 56:31.416
- I will.
- Today.

56:31.453 --> 56:33.717
- He's...
- He's a child.

56:38.761 --> 56:41.855
I can't get involved with this
right now, Sam.

56:41.897 --> 56:44.866
I'm trying to get my life together,
not fuck it up more.

56:44.900 --> 56:48.597
Look, I'm sorry that I lied to you.

56:48.637 --> 56:50.798
I'm a good person.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.570
- I'm trying to do the right thing here.
- You're going to take care of him?

56:53.609 --> 56:56.510
- For now, until I can...
- You're a mess.

56:57.880 --> 57:01.247
What, you don't need a project?

57:06.488 --> 57:08.353
I'm a mess too.

57:08.390 --> 57:10.381
Trust me.

57:12.328 --> 57:15.161
So let's...

57:15.197 --> 57:17.563
let's clean each other up.

57:21.837 --> 57:23.828
Bye, Sam.

57:57.740 --> 58:00.106
Sam.

58:00.142 --> 58:03.112
Come home soon.

58:04.413 --> 58:06.904
Sorry.

58:06.949 --> 58:09.179
- Hey.
- Are you crazy?

58:09.218 --> 58:11.812
- Why is he still with you?
- I'm helping him.

58:11.854 --> 58:14.322
Well, I talked to my friend Jill,
who's a social worker,

58:14.356 --> 58:17.154
and according to New York state law,
you've kidnapped him.

58:17.192 --> 58:20.389
Are you okay?
Do you miss your family?

58:20.429 --> 58:21.987
Is he feeding you?

58:22.031 --> 58:23.760
- What are you eating?
- Don't answer that.

58:23.799 --> 58:27.326
Look, I get that this is
killer material for a novel.

58:27.369 --> 58:30.964
Sensitive white guy learns life lessons
by taking in small black...

58:31.006 --> 58:34.806
- You actually think that I'm...
- Are you writing about him, Sam?

58:34.843 --> 58:36.902
This is a big deal.

58:36.946 --> 58:40.438
You can't just keep him.
He's not a goldfish.

58:40.482 --> 58:43.212
You need to let someone
know where he is.

58:44.687 --> 58:46.678
Look at these.

58:50.826 --> 58:52.817
I'm anxious to see
what will happen

58:52.861 --> 58:55.830
if I give him more than two pens
and a highlighter.

59:02.071 --> 59:04.062
Come on.

59:11.447 --> 59:13.881
Please fix this.
Your mom would be so upset.

59:13.916 --> 59:17.010
And then she's going to call my mom
and my mom's going to call me,

59:17.052 --> 59:19.020
and I don't have the energy.

59:19.054 --> 59:22.820
It's okay.
I'm on it, I promise.

59:22.858 --> 59:25.418
Okay.

59:25.461 --> 59:27.156
- I think you're good.
- Great.

59:27.196 --> 59:29.426
- Hey, Rasheen, say thank you.
- Thank you.

59:31.500 --> 59:33.968
Thank you.

59:34.003 --> 59:36.164
Come on, let's go.

59:36.205 --> 59:38.196
- Hey, Sam.
- Yep?

59:39.842 --> 59:42.811
- You've spent time in Los Angeles.
- Yeah.

59:42.845 --> 59:45.109
- Do you like it?
- It's okay.

59:45.147 --> 59:47.342
Would you ever want
to live there?

59:47.383 --> 59:49.715
No. Okay.

59:49.752 --> 59:51.242
Come on.

01:00:03.265 --> 01:00:05.256
Go.

01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:17.273
People shouldn't be able
to give him so much shit.

01:00:17.312 --> 01:00:20.440
The man's made
some of the best movies of all time.

01:00:20.482 --> 01:00:22.507
He just makes too many of them.

01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:26.419
One every year?
Why not one every other year?

01:00:26.455 --> 01:00:29.151
Take some time off
to recharge,

01:00:29.191 --> 01:00:35.152
spend a little quality time
with the wife-slash-daughter.

01:00:35.197 --> 01:00:37.392
Get out there,

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:41.836
live a little, you know?

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:44.737
- Marry me.
- What?

01:00:44.773 --> 01:00:47.867
- Let's get married.
- What?

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.775
Marry me, baby.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:53.373
- Be my wife.
- What?

01:00:53.415 --> 01:00:56.441
I'm serious.
Let's do it.

01:00:56.485 --> 01:01:00.819
I'm sorry.
You're asking me to marry you?

01:01:00.856 --> 01:01:02.847
Yes.

01:01:18.507 --> 01:01:20.498
So?

01:01:24.079 --> 01:01:27.071
- You want to marry me?
- Totally.

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:29.084
Marriage.

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:39.593
- I'm not buying it.
- What?

01:01:39.628 --> 01:01:42.392
- There's something off about this.
- Wait, what are you talking about?

01:01:43.532 --> 01:01:47.229
Did you... did this just occur to you,
like, 60 seconds ago?

01:01:47.269 --> 01:01:48.531
- "Let's get married"?
- No.

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:51.095
I've been giving it
a lot of thought

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.041
and I think we should do it.

01:01:54.076 --> 01:01:58.479
Uh-huh.
You got a, you know, ring?

01:02:00.582 --> 01:02:02.447
Well, I will.

01:02:02.484 --> 01:02:05.351
I mean you will... get one.

01:02:05.387 --> 01:02:08.550
I didn't know you'd be
a stickler for protocol.

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:10.751
Come on, Mary Catherine,

01:02:10.792 --> 01:02:13.283
we're not those people.

01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:14.818
Just say yes.

01:02:14.863 --> 01:02:16.694
If we're not those people,
why even get married?

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:19.200
We make fun of married people.

01:02:19.234 --> 01:02:21.259
And didn't I tell you,
like, first thing

01:02:21.303 --> 01:02:23.703
I didn't think I should
ever get married?

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:26.264
- That I come from a long line...
- You come from a long line...

01:02:26.308 --> 01:02:28.139
- of divorced people.
- That's right.

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:31.704
I'm not genetically wired for it
and you said you felt the same.

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:34.443
So why this?
Why now?

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.781
Love.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.658
Huh.

01:02:43.692 --> 01:02:46.991
Wow.

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:49.827
You really want out, don't you?

01:02:56.171 --> 01:03:01.905
So I'm trying to let go
of the whole idea of... I don't know...

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:06.881
that we have to pay for our joy
with sorrow or tragedy,

01:03:06.915 --> 01:03:10.078
that there has to be
some sort of karmic balance.

01:03:10.118 --> 01:03:12.780
But it sure feels that way.
You know what I mean?

01:03:12.821 --> 01:03:15.221
Mm, absolutely.

01:03:15.257 --> 01:03:17.589
You're really smart.

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:24.962
I do this thing...

01:03:26.768 --> 01:03:28.633
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:30.297
Oh, come on, come on,
come on.

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:32.170
Anytime you want
an embarrassing story about me,

01:03:32.207 --> 01:03:36.303
just let me know.
I have tons... tons.

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:40.714
Okay, um...

01:03:40.749 --> 01:03:43.775
about a year ago,
I was in this cab

01:03:43.819 --> 01:03:47.277
and the cab driver, this Indian guy,
started telling me...

01:03:47.322 --> 01:03:50.450
he started telling me
all sorts of stuff.

01:03:50.492 --> 01:03:54.792
He... he was just looking at me
in the rearview mirror

01:03:54.830 --> 01:04:00.097
and he said, "Bliss...
bliss is your birthright."

01:04:00.135 --> 01:04:03.468
And I was like,
"Uh, 45th and Madison?"

01:04:05.207 --> 01:04:09.439
And he said, "You have
great potential in this lifetime.

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:14.108
The key to your life is gratitude.
You do not give enough thanks."

01:04:14.149 --> 01:04:16.276
And I said,
"Well, how do I do that?"

01:04:16.318 --> 01:04:19.515
And he said, "Simple.
Say thank you."

01:04:19.554 --> 01:04:21.545
And I said, "Well, when?"

01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:24.753
And he said, "All the time.
Right now."

01:04:24.793 --> 01:04:28.786
And he said after I say "thank you,"
I should say "more please."

01:04:29.965 --> 01:04:33.093
- Wait. "Thank you. More please"?
- Yeah.

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:37.572
That with gratitude the universe
is eternally abundant.

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:44.408
So I've been giving
gratitude a shot.

01:04:44.446 --> 01:04:46.038
Thank you.
More please.

01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:48.242
Thank you. More please.

01:04:48.283 --> 01:04:49.841
Thank you.
More please.

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:52.376
- How crazy am I sounding here?
- Oh, no no no no no.

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:55.549
No, not at all.
Not at all.

01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:59.026
Have... have you noticed
a difference?

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:01.052
- No.
- No?

01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:04.395
I mean yes, but whatever.

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:09.029
Anyway, what got you
into photography?

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:11.631
Oh, I wouldn't... I wouldn't
call it photography.

01:05:11.673 --> 01:05:13.664
What would you call it?

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:16.735
- Well, taking pictures, I guess.
- Okay.

01:05:16.778 --> 01:05:19.611
Well, why do you take pictures?

01:05:19.648 --> 01:05:21.980
Um, I don't know.

01:05:22.017 --> 01:05:25.145
When I... when I see
something I like looking at, I...

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:29.551
I get to keep looking at it.

01:05:43.605 --> 01:05:47.097
You shouldn't be flattered
that I came back.

01:05:47.142 --> 01:05:49.633
- Why?
- It's a bad sign.

01:05:49.678 --> 01:05:54.377
The men I fall for
are horrible and cruel.

01:05:56.852 --> 01:06:00.618
And if I'm here,
you must be one of them.

01:06:07.095 --> 01:06:12.089
I like having you here.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:14.466
Well, that's nice.

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:19.699
For the record
I still don't trust you.

01:06:19.741 --> 01:06:23.199
- You should trust me.
- Why should I?

01:06:24.913 --> 01:06:27.347
Because someone has to.

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:31.150
There was...
there was one time

01:06:31.186 --> 01:06:33.814
when I was in the...
in the second grade

01:06:33.855 --> 01:06:36.221
and we all got these pictures
of Santa Claus

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:37.953
that, you know,
were left empty and blank

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:39.961
and we were supposed to,
you know, color them in.

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:43.294
And so I colored Santa's clothes
the way I wanted

01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:47.097
and my teacher, Mrs. Porter,
she was just...

01:06:47.135 --> 01:06:50.832
ugh, she was just this miserable
miserable woman.

01:06:50.872 --> 01:06:53.773
She grabbed my paper
off my desk

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:56.209
and she held it up to the class
and she said,

01:06:56.244 --> 01:07:00.180
"Samuel here colored
Santa's pants blue.

01:07:00.215 --> 01:07:03.514
And we all know
that Santa's pants are red."

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:05.543
And she ripped up the paper,

01:07:05.587 --> 01:07:08.021
gave me a new one
and made me start over.

01:07:08.056 --> 01:07:10.524
- Mrs. Porter!
- I know.

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.322
So I ran home
screaming and crying.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.884
I told my parents what happened.

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:17.262
And my dad... my dad came to school
with me in the morning.

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:19.392
He barged
into the teachers' lounge

01:07:19.434 --> 01:07:21.334
and he started screaming
at Mrs. Porter,

01:07:21.369 --> 01:07:23.360
"Who says Santa's pants
have to be red?!"

01:07:23.405 --> 01:07:26.465
- Yes! Go, Dad!
- Right? That was awesome.

01:07:26.508 --> 01:07:27.805
- That was awesome.
- Wow.

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.242
And that was like a...
from that point on,

01:07:29.277 --> 01:07:31.108
that was like a battle cry
in my house, you know.

01:07:31.146 --> 01:07:33.478
"Who says Santa's pants have to be red?"

01:07:33.515 --> 01:07:36.075
- Yeah, who says?
- I know. I know. I know.

01:07:36.117 --> 01:07:38.381
So that was awesome.
But that's my pop.

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.581
What about your dad?
How's... what's he like?

01:07:40.622 --> 01:07:42.317
- Uh, he's great.
- He's great?

01:07:42.357 --> 01:07:44.791
- Yeah, he's the best.
- Mm.

01:07:44.826 --> 01:07:46.919
- This is me.
- Ooh.

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:48.953
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:07:50.999 --> 01:07:53.467
- This was nice.
- Mm.

01:07:53.502 --> 01:07:56.665
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:58.730
More please?

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.346
Right.

01:08:07.382 --> 01:08:08.872
I'll see you at work.

01:08:08.917 --> 01:08:10.612
- See ya.
- See ya.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.336
Dude.

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:36.707
This is really good.

01:08:46.187 --> 01:08:49.554
- Sam?
- Yeah?

01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:51.582
You're my best friend.

01:08:59.267 --> 01:09:01.258
Thanks, man.

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:04.761
You're mine too.

01:09:07.075 --> 01:09:09.635
So how can I help you?

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.545
Well, I have some questions
about foster care.

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:14.912
Okay. Uh...

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:17.111
Well, I might be interested
in taking someone in

01:09:17.152 --> 01:09:19.143
or on or whatever.

01:09:19.187 --> 01:09:21.984
- Okay. Are you married?
- No.

01:09:22.023 --> 01:09:24.617
- Job?
- Yeah. Well, freelance.

01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:26.649
But I should tell you I don't
really know how any of this works,

01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:29.993
but I'm interested in taking someone in
who's been in foster care.

01:09:30.031 --> 01:09:33.694
He's been staying with me and I think
the situation he was in wasn't great.

01:09:33.734 --> 01:09:36.363
Wait, you have this child
with you now?

01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:37.769
Yeah.

01:09:37.805 --> 01:09:41.242
A child who was in foster care
in the state of New York?

01:09:41.276 --> 01:09:43.107
Yeah, but he...

01:09:43.144 --> 01:09:46.203
And he's living with you,
yet you're not his legal guardian?

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:48.647
Why is that?

01:09:48.683 --> 01:09:52.551
And where is this child right now
while you're sitting here talking to me?

01:09:55.056 --> 01:09:57.752
No no no no. No.

01:09:57.792 --> 01:10:00.158
I'm sorry.

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:03.130
I'm a writer and I just...

01:10:03.164 --> 01:10:06.292
you know, I... I had some questions
about the whole deal.

01:10:06.334 --> 01:10:09.895
Mr. Wexler,
is this your current address?

01:10:09.938 --> 01:10:13.840
I'm sorry, there's been... it's fine.
Thank you for your time.

01:10:13.875 --> 01:10:15.866
Mr. Wexler?

01:10:34.929 --> 01:10:38.365
He looks like he should be
making balloon animals

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.061
at birthday parties.

01:10:40.101 --> 01:10:42.365
Why do I have to be
with balloon animal guy?

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:45.999
You don't have to do anything.
You just... he sounds great, that's all.

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:48.373
I want you to be happy.

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:51.811
And his name's Sam.
Come on, that's a strong name.

01:10:51.846 --> 01:10:54.280
And this coming from the guy
who likes his girls

01:10:54.315 --> 01:10:57.614
with belly button rings
and the lower back tattoos...

01:10:57.652 --> 01:10:59.916
- That is outrageous!
...spending half their lives

01:10:59.954 --> 01:11:02.218
- doing spinning classes.
- What?

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:05.886
And I'm sure Alabama is a homely
fat girl with a kickin' personality.

01:11:05.927 --> 01:11:08.896
- Mississippi.
- Whatever. Red states.

01:11:19.374 --> 01:11:22.172
Sammy,

01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:25.577
you said you were going to deal
with the kid thing yesterday.

01:11:25.613 --> 01:11:27.740
Everyone's getting worried.

01:11:27.782 --> 01:11:29.773
I know. I'm...

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.444
I will. It's...

01:11:38.326 --> 01:11:41.591
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:45.827
Um, Mississippi, Annie.
Annie, the famous Mississippi.

01:11:45.867 --> 01:11:48.836
- And I'm not famous?
- Shut up.

01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:51.566
- It's so nice to meet you.
- You too.

01:11:51.606 --> 01:11:54.803
So, uh, you're from Mississippi?

01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.538
Yep.

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:59.138
What's that like?
Don't answer that.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:04.413
I'm just talking
and this is me leaving.

01:12:04.452 --> 01:12:07.717
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

01:12:15.196 --> 01:12:16.754
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

01:12:16.798 --> 01:12:19.289
- I didn't see you sit down.
- Yeah, hi.

01:12:20.735 --> 01:12:22.566
Do you remember what you said to me

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:25.038
- the first night we kissed?
- No.

01:12:25.073 --> 01:12:28.770
I was wearing
this little black cocktail dress.

01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:32.940
It was way too fancy
for the bar we were at,

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:35.415
but I thought I could pull it off.

01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:37.884
You know, like,
"Oh, this little number?

01:12:37.919 --> 01:12:40.854
Just threw this on.
No big deal."

01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:44.624
You came and met us.

01:12:46.427 --> 01:12:50.727
I was all excited to see you.

01:12:50.765 --> 01:12:55.532
And you sat down
next to me at the table.

01:12:57.205 --> 01:13:01.642
- You really don't remember this?
- No.

01:13:04.112 --> 01:13:07.206
You looked at the dress
and you said,

01:13:07.248 --> 01:13:10.217
"Where are you going, prom?"

01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:12.412
I'm sorry.

01:13:12.453 --> 01:13:15.081
No, it was perfect

01:13:15.123 --> 01:13:18.115
because finally here he was...

01:13:18.159 --> 01:13:21.060
the guy who wouldn't let me
get away with anything.

01:13:24.599 --> 01:13:29.696
I always thought of that
as the moment you came into focus.

01:13:29.737 --> 01:13:35.733
Like, oh, there you were.

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.305
And now...

01:13:44.485 --> 01:13:48.888
it's like you're out of focus
all of a sudden,

01:13:48.923 --> 01:13:54.054
ever since you got back...
just fainter and fainter to me.

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:58.589
And I'm...

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:07.200
just sad to see you go,
that's all.

01:14:12.947 --> 01:14:15.814
I don't know if I'm going to go.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.584
Yes, you do.

01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:25.983
Make sure you get there
kind of early.

01:14:26.027 --> 01:14:27.654
I'm going to try
and reserve you a table,

01:14:27.695 --> 01:14:30.459
but it gets kind of crowded
and I don't want you to have to stand.

01:14:30.498 --> 01:14:32.591
- So get there kind of early.
- We're gonna get there kind of early.

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:34.693
Okay. Are you sure you know
where you're going?

01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:38.797
Uh, the city's on a grid,
so yeah, we'll figure it out.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:41.365
I'm so excited.
I'm kind of excited.

01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:43.240
- I'm totally excited.
- We are too.

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:46.372
- Okay. Bye.
- All right, bye.

01:14:46.414 --> 01:14:50.350
See you tonight.
Break a leg thing.

01:14:56.224 --> 01:14:59.682
- Ah.
- Ah.

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:08.066
What do we say if she's terrible?

01:15:08.102 --> 01:15:10.593
Tell her she looked pretty.

01:15:12.173 --> 01:15:14.038
That's a great idea, my friend.

01:15:14.075 --> 01:15:16.134
We're going to do that.

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:25.417
- Sam Wexler?
- Yeah?

01:15:25.453 --> 01:15:29.082
What... what's...
um, what's going on?

01:15:29.123 --> 01:15:30.784
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:15:30.825 --> 01:15:33.726
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

01:15:33.761 --> 01:15:35.490
- What's going on?
- You have the right to an attorney.

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:37.521
All right, what's going to happen...
what's going to happen to the kid?

01:15:37.565 --> 01:15:39.556
If you refuse that right,
the court will provide one for you.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.830
Okay okay.
Rasheen, it's going to be fine.

01:15:43.137 --> 01:15:45.002
He didn't do anything bad.

01:15:59.687 --> 01:16:02.087
Hey.

01:16:03.791 --> 01:16:05.884
I want you to read
lots of books, okay?

01:16:08.262 --> 01:16:11.163
I don't want you
to ever stop drawing.

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:13.997
Just... just keep doing it, okay?

01:16:14.035 --> 01:16:18.301
- Promise me.
- I promise.

01:16:18.339 --> 01:16:21.274
And I'll come to one
of your art shows in 20 years

01:16:21.309 --> 01:16:25.837
and I won't be able
to afford anything, but you'll, like...

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.871
you'll, like, sketch something
on a napkin for me

01:16:27.915 --> 01:16:29.906
and that'll be
my retirement fund, okay?

01:16:29.951 --> 01:16:33.546
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:12.325
Sam? Sam.

01:18:03.444 --> 01:18:06.743
#One and one
is through, you know #

01:18:06.781 --> 01:18:08.681
#The lily grew #

01:18:08.716 --> 01:18:10.650
- # Between the snow... #
- Well...

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:14.086
#I thought you knew
the lily grew #

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:18.058
#I thought you knew,
I thought you know #

01:18:18.092 --> 01:18:21.755
#Under cover we read plays #

01:18:21.796 --> 01:18:25.095
#Molière,
those were the days #

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:28.762
#Robespierre,
the Reign of Terror #

01:18:28.803 --> 01:18:33.536
#No underwear,
no wonder we're afraid #

01:18:33.574 --> 01:18:35.064
#My love, what gives? #

01:18:35.109 --> 01:18:36.599
I don't want to make you

01:18:36.644 --> 01:18:39.112
stay here with me
if you want out.

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:41.945
I want you to be happy,
even if I'm miserable.

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:44.451
I am not going to be the person
who ruins your life

01:18:44.485 --> 01:18:49.388
and shackles you to a city
or a woman you don't want.

01:18:49.423 --> 01:18:52.392
Oh God. Oh God,
this feels so awful,

01:18:52.426 --> 01:18:55.224
like some sort of
grand manipulation

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:58.198
when it should be
a happy thing maybe.

01:18:58.232 --> 01:19:01.429
But I'm totally freaked out
and I don't know who else to tell

01:19:01.469 --> 01:19:03.630
- and you're my best friend...
- Okay okay. Shh shh.

01:19:03.671 --> 01:19:07.573
...in the whole world and...
- Hey hey. Shh.

01:19:07.608 --> 01:19:09.473
Will you breathe?

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:13.640
Please please.

01:19:19.754 --> 01:19:22.018
Good.

01:19:22.056 --> 01:19:24.490
That's good.
Sit down.

01:19:28.829 --> 01:19:31.889
Now tell me what is going on.

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:34.697
I can't.

01:19:34.735 --> 01:19:37.829
I'm afraid of what will happen
when it hits the air.

01:19:37.872 --> 01:19:41.239
You can say anything to me.

01:19:41.275 --> 01:19:43.607
You threw a vase at my head
three years ago

01:19:43.644 --> 01:19:46.112
- and I stuck around, didn't I?
- You ducked.

01:19:46.147 --> 01:19:48.308
Fuck yeah, I ducked.
I have great reflexes.

01:19:48.349 --> 01:19:51.147
That's what I'm saying.
I can take it.

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:58.485
Whisper it to me.

01:20:27.922 --> 01:20:31.085
I will live wherever you want.

01:20:31.125 --> 01:20:33.992
- I'll move to LA.
- I'll stay in New York.

01:20:34.028 --> 01:20:37.828
- We can move to Los Angeles.
- We can move to Iceland.

01:20:37.865 --> 01:20:40.060
Fuck it. Let's move to Poland.

01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:42.262
Beirut! I don't care.

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:58.947
Did you get my message?

01:20:58.986 --> 01:21:01.011
I got 12 of them.
Were there more?

01:21:01.055 --> 01:21:03.046
Look, I... I don't know
what else to say.

01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:04.580
I don't care that
you weren't there, Sam.

01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:06.149
Well, what... what
do you want from me?

01:21:06.193 --> 01:21:08.320
I want you to go away!

01:21:10.965 --> 01:21:13.866
You're making me sad, okay?
And I want you to leave.

01:21:20.841 --> 01:21:24.777
You know how long
we knew each other?

01:21:24.812 --> 01:21:27.406
A week.

01:21:27.448 --> 01:21:30.008
One week.

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:34.317
I mean we were playing house
and it was fun, but...

01:21:35.456 --> 01:21:37.617
I'm sorry about Rasheen,

01:21:37.658 --> 01:21:40.320
but what did you expect
was going to happen?

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:46.166
I realized the problem.

01:21:48.235 --> 01:21:51.898
You write short stories

01:21:51.939 --> 01:21:55.204
and I think you like
living short stories.

01:21:58.479 --> 01:22:01.915
But I'm kind of ready
for the novel, you know?

01:22:11.292 --> 01:22:12.953
All right.

01:22:12.993 --> 01:22:15.553
Okay, what are we feeling,
red or white?

01:22:18.065 --> 01:22:20.158
- Sam?
- Hmm?

01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:22.601
We need to talk.

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:30.672
You mean the talk
where you tell me how great I am,

01:22:30.711 --> 01:22:33.839
but you can't get involved
and it's not me, it's you,

01:22:33.881 --> 01:22:35.906
and you're damaged
and you wish you could and...

01:22:39.019 --> 01:22:41.954
I refuse to have that talk.

01:22:41.989 --> 01:22:44.651
Now would you like red
or would you like white?

01:22:46.026 --> 01:22:48.017
Sam...

01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:54.262
look, I... I'm not...
I'm not good for you.

01:22:57.338 --> 01:22:59.533
What?

01:22:59.573 --> 01:23:01.063
Are you happy?

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:05.442
No, I'm not happy.

01:23:05.479 --> 01:23:07.743
I could make you happy.

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:14.079
Seriously, let me love you.

01:23:14.121 --> 01:23:17.955
I am totally up to the task.

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:20.825
Actually, I've already started.

01:23:20.861 --> 01:23:22.453
- I can't... I can't do this.
- No no no no.

01:23:22.496 --> 01:23:24.623
Don't... come on, don't walk out
on this before it even started.

01:23:24.665 --> 01:23:27.225
Please.

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:29.259
Look at me.

01:23:34.708 --> 01:23:38.144
I get it, okay?

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:40.511
I get it.

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:43.016
I'm not the guy you had in mind.

01:23:45.419 --> 01:23:47.819
But what if you don't know
what's best for you?

01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:52.657
- And you do?
- I believe I do.

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:58.063
Where did you come from,
Sam #2?

01:23:58.098 --> 01:24:00.328
Westchester.

01:24:01.969 --> 01:24:05.837
Do you want to know why
I hang out on the fifth floor?

01:24:07.408 --> 01:24:10.377
The first time I saw you...

01:24:10.411 --> 01:24:15.678
God, I thought, "Wow!

01:24:15.716 --> 01:24:20.449
Her... the girl
with the funny headwrap.

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:24.254
I want to be near that girl."

01:24:24.291 --> 01:24:27.852
Trust me, I don't
normally talk this way,

01:24:27.895 --> 01:24:30.125
but I am gone over you.

01:24:30.164 --> 01:24:32.029
- Stop, okay? Shut the fuck up.
- Why? Why?

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:33.931
Just stop, please. Just stop.
Don't say that.

01:24:33.968 --> 01:24:35.936
You can hear this.

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:42.241
- Close your eyes.
- What?

01:24:42.276 --> 01:24:44.506
I just want you to listen to me.

01:24:46.647 --> 01:24:48.512
Humor me, please?

01:24:57.024 --> 01:25:00.357
It's not easy to be adored.

01:25:00.394 --> 01:25:04.763
You in particular... you have
a tougher time with it than most.

01:25:04.798 --> 01:25:09.132
I get that.
But I want you to give it a try.

01:25:09.169 --> 01:25:11.535
Think of it as an experiment.

01:25:13.474 --> 01:25:17.570
I promise I will be very wonderful
at adoring you, Annie.

01:25:17.611 --> 01:25:20.944
It's an area where I think I've got
a great deal of talent.

01:25:24.518 --> 01:25:26.577
You're worth the adoration, Annie.

01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:28.611
You're worth it.

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:30.487
And the fact that
you don't believe it

01:25:30.524 --> 01:25:32.754
has nothing to do with
whether it's true or not.

01:25:32.793 --> 01:25:35.762
It is true for me

01:25:35.796 --> 01:25:38.526
and that is all that matters.

01:26:25.579 --> 01:26:29.640
#I was sleeping in the lilies #

01:26:29.683 --> 01:26:31.708
#Or was I up all night? #

01:26:31.752 --> 01:26:37.384
#These days it's hard to tell
what's half-asleep from fully alive... #

01:26:37.424 --> 01:26:39.051
Wexler!

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:42.995
#We were loving
like a landslide #

01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:46.967
#Or were we in a fight? #

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:50.596
This writer that I know
once told me this great thing.

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:52.902
He said every five years
he realizes

01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:56.103
what an asshole he was
five years ago.

01:26:56.143 --> 01:26:58.202
Every five years,
like clockwork, he goes,

01:26:58.245 --> 01:27:02.579
"Man, I was such an asshole
five years ago."

01:27:04.218 --> 01:27:07.119
So if we accept this,
that means everything

01:27:07.154 --> 01:27:10.180
we think and feel
and say now

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:14.524
in five years
will just be embarrassing.

01:27:14.561 --> 01:27:16.995
- This conversation?
- The worst.

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:18.692
We're going to hate
this conversation.

01:27:18.732 --> 01:27:20.723
- I hate it now.
- We're going to hate it in four years.

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:35.439
Did you play sports
when you were a kid?

01:27:35.482 --> 01:27:37.109
Yeah.

01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:39.346
You remember "Walk it off"?

01:27:39.386 --> 01:27:41.377
No matter what happened, right?

01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:43.947
I mean your eyeball could be,
like, hanging out of its socket.

01:27:43.991 --> 01:27:46.323
Coach would run over,
scoop you up.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.760
"Eh, you're all right, kid.
Just walk it off."

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.957
Yeah.

01:27:50.998 --> 01:27:53.899
And I'm sure a few of those times
I was legitimately hurt.

01:27:53.934 --> 01:27:56.300
But just having this concept...
walk it off...

01:27:56.336 --> 01:28:01.706
as a way to, I don't know,
heal myself... it worked.

01:28:01.742 --> 01:28:04.438
I just walked that shit off.

01:28:08.716 --> 01:28:12.447
I've been feeling lately
I'm maybe more resilient

01:28:12.486 --> 01:28:14.477
than I had thought.

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:17.751
But who knows?

01:28:17.791 --> 01:28:20.589
Maybe I'll feel differently
in five years.

01:28:22.529 --> 01:28:24.520
Who knows?

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:32.035
Hello.
No one is available to take your call.

01:28:32.072 --> 01:28:33.869
Please leave a message
after the tone.

01:28:35.042 --> 01:28:37.943
All right, I'm guessing
you're there,

01:28:37.978 --> 01:28:40.242
but you're sad
and you can't be bothered.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:44.774
But I have a tale to tell, Samuel,
and you need to hear it.

01:28:44.818 --> 01:28:46.979
So listen up.

01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:50.012
The scene: dinner with #2.

01:28:50.057 --> 01:28:53.618
Trying to cut him loose.
No such luck.

01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:55.150
So get this.

01:28:55.195 --> 01:28:57.561
You know how people say
beauty's on the inside?

01:28:57.598 --> 01:28:59.259
Well, that's total bullshit.

01:28:59.299 --> 01:29:03.531
Beauty is on the outside,
and I love me some beauty.

01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:05.060
I mean who doesn't?

01:29:05.105 --> 01:29:07.232
But here's the crazy thing,
Sammy boy.

01:29:07.274 --> 01:29:09.367
I'm listening to Sam #2.

01:29:09.409 --> 01:29:14.244
Listening because he made me
close my eyes... so hot.

01:29:14.281 --> 01:29:18.183
And he's making a total case
for me and him to be an item.

01:29:18.218 --> 01:29:22.951
And as he's talking,
it's like the molecules on his face

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:25.891
must have
rearranged themselves,

01:29:25.926 --> 01:29:28.087
because I open my eyes
and suddenly

01:29:28.128 --> 01:29:33.566
I am in front of the most beautiful,
gorgeous man...

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.693
like, a total hottie.

01:29:35.736 --> 01:29:38.705
And who knew? Sammy 2.
That rhymes.

01:29:38.739 --> 01:29:41.833
And you were right, by the way.
It is a strong name.

01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:45.311
So here's what I have to say to you
before the damn beep cuts me off.

01:29:45.345 --> 01:29:47.108
Sadness be gone.

01:29:47.147 --> 01:29:50.947
Let's be people who deserve
to be loved, who are worthy.

01:29:50.984 --> 01:29:53.680
Because we are worthy.
We really are.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:57.816
You've been telling me that for years
and now I get to spit it back at you.

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.890
You're a good man,
Sam Wexler.

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:03.988
Go get yourself loved.

01:30:04.031 --> 01:30:06.864
That's all I got.

01:30:27.721 --> 01:30:30.315
#Hey, Jo Jo #

01:30:30.357 --> 01:30:33.019
#Yeah, I know your name... #

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.893
Jill. Hey, it's Sam Wexler.

01:30:35.929 --> 01:30:37.920
I think Mary Catherine
told you I'd be calling.

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:41.833
#Thought I saw you
jump the Utah train... #

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:44.201
They moved him
to a different home.

01:30:46.273 --> 01:30:49.606
#Could be as well... #

01:30:51.111 --> 01:30:55.275
- Thank you.
- # I cannot tell #

01:30:55.315 --> 01:30:58.546
#Oh no, I cannot tell. #

01:31:11.531 --> 01:31:15.490
Okay, this... this last song...

01:31:16.803 --> 01:31:22.571
it's a happy song
about a happy song.

01:31:24.077 --> 01:31:27.706
It's kind of what I need
to hear right now.

01:31:27.748 --> 01:31:29.739
Thanks, y'all.

01:31:37.591 --> 01:31:41.459
#Sing me a happy song #

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:44.487
#About robins in spring #

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:50.627
#Sing me a happy song #

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:55.768
#With a happy ending #

01:31:57.811 --> 01:32:01.212
#Some cheerful roundelay #

01:32:01.248 --> 01:32:05.309
#About catching the ring #

01:32:05.352 --> 01:32:12.053
#Sing happy #

01:32:13.126 --> 01:32:18.962
#Sing me a sonnet
all about rolling in gold #

01:32:18.999 --> 01:32:24.665
#Some peppy melody
about rainbows blending #

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:29.665
#Nothing with phrases saying
you're out in the cold #

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:35.615
#Sing happy #

01:32:35.649 --> 01:32:41.246
#Tell me tomorrow's gonna be
peaches and cream #

01:32:41.288 --> 01:32:46.487
#Assure me clouds are lined
with a silver lining #

01:32:46.526 --> 01:32:51.463
#Say how you realize
an impossible dream #

01:32:51.498 --> 01:32:56.197
#Sing me a happy song #

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:04.442
#No need reminding me
that it all fell apart #

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:10.747
#I need no lyric singing
of stormy weather #

01:33:11.852 --> 01:33:17.688
#There's quite enough around me
that's breaking my heart #

01:33:17.724 --> 01:33:20.158
#Sing #

01:33:20.193 --> 01:33:25.688
#Sing a hallelujah #

01:33:25.732 --> 01:33:28.929
#And get up and shout #

01:33:28.969 --> 01:33:33.997
#Tell me the sun is shining
around the corner #

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:38.978
#Whoever's interested
in helping me out #

01:33:39.012 --> 01:33:45.110
#Please keep it happy #

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:55.655
#I'm only in the market
for long, loud laughter #

01:33:55.695 --> 01:34:00.189
#I'll let you serenade me
till dawn comes along #

01:34:00.233 --> 01:34:03.669
#Just make it a happy #

01:34:03.703 --> 01:34:10.700
#Keep it a happy song. #

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:23.279
Bravo! Whoo!

01:34:26.526 --> 01:34:28.517
Yeah!

01:34:41.341 --> 01:34:46.904
#I can't remember
what is wrong #

01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:51.611
#Well, I've been happy now
for way too long #

01:34:51.651 --> 01:34:54.984
#And oh #

01:34:55.021 --> 01:34:59.253
#We got a lot more to go #

01:35:03.597 --> 01:35:09.194
#I put a trash can
by the road #

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:13.935
#And filled it up
just to lighten my load #

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:17.466
#But oh #

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:21.470
#I got nowhere to go #

01:35:25.685 --> 01:35:31.123
#Someone's alone,
fell asleep on the phone #

01:35:31.158 --> 01:35:36.460
#Waiting like a dog
for a bone #

01:35:36.496 --> 01:35:42.196
#And how could it be
that a fish in the sea #

01:35:42.235 --> 01:35:47.764
#Can feel like
it's completely alone? #

01:35:47.807 --> 01:35:53.336
#The world may never know #

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:57.646
#The world may
never know #

01:35:59.753 --> 01:36:02.620
#Oh #

01:36:02.656 --> 01:36:08.288
#I know it hurt you,
'cause you cried #

01:36:08.328 --> 01:36:12.890
#I know it killed you,
but nobody died #

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:16.266
#And oh #

01:36:16.303 --> 01:36:20.831
#The city ain't nothing
but show #

01:36:25.212 --> 01:36:30.912
#I found a needle
in the hay #

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:35.752
#I found the sunshine
at the end of the day #

01:36:35.789 --> 01:36:39.122
#And oh #

01:36:39.159 --> 01:36:43.152
#I found a pearl
in the snow #

01:36:47.267 --> 01:36:52.967
#Someone's alone,
fell asleep on the phone #

01:36:53.006 --> 01:36:58.000
#Waiting like a dog
for a bone #

01:36:58.044 --> 01:37:03.846
#Oh, and how could it be
that a fish in the sea #

01:37:03.883 --> 01:37:09.844
#Can feel like
it's completely alone? #

01:37:09.889 --> 01:37:15.418
#The world may never know #

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:21.059
#The world may
never know #

01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:26.733
#The world may never know #

01:37:26.773 --> 01:37:31.710
#The world may
never know. #

01:37:38.685 --> 01:37:41.483
#It is a dream
that I will wake from #

01:37:41.521 --> 01:37:43.921
#There Trudy writes
this song #

01:37:43.957 --> 01:37:48.826
#There's no need for an escape,
you've never been here all along #

01:37:48.862 --> 01:37:53.492
#You were in the Caribbean #

01:37:53.533 --> 01:37:58.561
#I'm in New York now thinkin' #

01:37:58.605 --> 01:38:03.099
#You say you want me,
but you never came to get me #

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:05.236
#Oh, you never got me #

01:38:05.278 --> 01:38:10.978
#And I hope you don't haunt
these dreams ever again #

01:38:11.017 --> 01:38:14.453
#And the long walk to never #

01:38:14.487 --> 01:38:20.722
#Surely takes forever
and ever. #
