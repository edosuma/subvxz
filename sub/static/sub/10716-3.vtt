00:44.278 --> 00:46.447
I hope you don't think
this tragic incident

00:46.447 --> 00:47.782
has anything to do with us.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.017
Did you know him?

00:49.017 --> 00:50.318
- Mr. Allen?
- Yeah.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.385
Long-time regular.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.054
Always comped his room.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.255
What'd he play?

00:54.255 --> 00:55.590
Blackjack, poker.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.291
Any good?

00:57.291 --> 00:58.660
Bit of a rabbit.

00:58.660 --> 01:02.396
Played loose.
Schoolboy draws.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.398
Tell it so I
can understand it.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.167
He wasn't as good
as he thought he was.

01:06.167 --> 01:09.303
Ever get him in trouble?
He owe anybody?

01:09.303 --> 01:10.739
Not as far as I know.

01:10.739 --> 01:12.674
One thing I've learned
in this business, detective:

01:12.674 --> 01:14.976
you never really know
what's in a guy's pocket.

01:14.976 --> 01:16.645
You ever see him
with anyone

01:16.645 --> 01:18.379
around the hotel,
at the tables?

01:18.379 --> 01:19.480
Pal? Girl?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.849
Played solo.

01:20.849 --> 01:23.417
Far as I know, he always
checked in solo, too.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.919
I need to see the room.

01:24.919 --> 01:27.989
Since we didn't hear
from LAPD until Tuesday,

01:27.989 --> 01:30.291
there was no question
of preserving the scene.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.928
The room was rented last
Saturday,

01:33.928 --> 01:35.096
right after Mr. Allen
checked out,

01:35.096 --> 01:36.665
and of course
cleaned every day.

01:36.665 --> 01:38.066
I'm still gonna need
to see the room.

01:38.066 --> 01:40.669
Well, the current occupant
checks out tomorrow.

01:40.669 --> 01:42.904
Occupant?
When the LAPD called,

01:42.904 --> 01:44.773
they specifically asked
that the room be left empty

01:44.773 --> 01:46.708
until we had a chance
to check it out.

01:46.708 --> 01:48.810
What can I say?
Somebody made a mistake.

01:48.810 --> 01:50.912
Yeah they did.
Call the room.

01:51.780 --> 01:52.981
It's after midnight.

01:52.981 --> 01:55.049
Maybe the occupant's
in the casino.

01:56.384 --> 01:57.786
Well, like Mr. Allen,

01:57.786 --> 02:00.121
this guest is one of
our treasured regulars.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.456
Unless you have a warrant--

02:02.456 --> 02:04.258
I'll be back tomorrow.

02:04.258 --> 02:07.896
I'm also gonna need to talk
to the dealers, too,

02:07.896 --> 02:10.464
anyone else who had contact
with Allen last week.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.933
I'll make 'em
available to you.

02:11.933 --> 02:14.035
Hey, you want a room?
I'm happy to comp you.

02:14.035 --> 02:15.770
LAPD is picking up the tab.

02:15.770 --> 02:17.706
This would be an upgrade,
trust me.

02:17.706 --> 02:19.140
I'm also gonna need
to take a look

02:19.140 --> 02:20.709
at the eye in the sky
footage from last week.

02:20.709 --> 02:22.010
Sorry.

02:22.010 --> 02:24.445
You gonna make me get
a warrant for that, too?

02:24.445 --> 02:25.780
If it were up to me--

02:25.780 --> 02:27.716
I know.
You don't make the rules.

02:27.716 --> 02:29.884
I just make sure
they're followed.

02:53.942 --> 02:56.911
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:56.911 --> 02:59.180
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:59.180 --> 03:01.883
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:01.883 --> 03:04.919
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:04.919 --> 03:07.288
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:07.288 --> 03:10.191
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:10.191 --> 03:12.794
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:12.794 --> 03:14.763
* I can't let go *

03:26.908 --> 03:29.377
* I feel *

03:48.930 --> 03:50.298
Check it out.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.332
Look at that.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.368
I might have
to get me one of those.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.805
Yeah, well, now you can
afford one of these.

03:58.807 --> 04:00.241
What's this?

04:00.241 --> 04:01.675
What do you mean,
what's this?

04:01.675 --> 04:02.944
It's for
the other night.

04:02.944 --> 04:06.347
It's your little piece
of the Tito frito pie.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.817
Whooee. Ha ha ha ha.

04:08.817 --> 04:10.718
That's right.
That's three large, baby.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.020
You sure?

04:12.020 --> 04:13.822
Yeah, I'm serious.
You earned it.

04:13.822 --> 04:15.556
You--

04:15.556 --> 04:18.426
You scared the shit out
of that little freak Tito.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.694
Glad to see that you
still got it.

04:20.694 --> 04:24.332
Takes me back, watching you
work that kid over like that.

04:25.834 --> 04:28.837
Shit, man. I mean,
y'all got anything
else in the works?

04:34.208 --> 04:35.844
What do you mean, y'all'?

04:35.844 --> 04:38.046
Oh, I mean, I don't know.
I just assumed--

04:38.046 --> 04:39.948
You just assumed that what?

04:42.383 --> 04:45.854
Nothing, man. It's
just a figure of speech.

04:45.854 --> 04:47.655
That--
That shit right there.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.290
That drone is sweet,
bro.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.326
Yeah. That thing's
top of the line.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.028
25 minutes of flying time
on a single charge,

04:54.028 --> 04:55.864
real-time video.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.335
Oh, yeah. I definitely
got to get me one of those.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.204
Maybe you can get one
for your pops, too,

05:03.204 --> 05:05.974
for his birthday, so he
can keep an eye on you.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.176
Yeah, man.

05:08.176 --> 05:09.577
Maybe I'll get him one
with a joystick, too,

05:09.577 --> 05:11.379
so he can shove
it up his ass.

05:17.285 --> 05:19.453
Those pristine prints
on Allen's leather jacket?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.923
No matches. Not local,
not national. Nada.

05:21.923 --> 05:23.524
Mm-hmm. Figures.
Anything else?

05:23.524 --> 05:26.060
S.I.D. found trace
evidence of old blood

05:26.060 --> 05:27.628
in the trunk of his Bentley.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.629
And it's not Allen's.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.898
It could be anybody's.

05:29.898 --> 05:31.365
The guy who
details his car.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.333
Is there DNA?

05:32.333 --> 05:33.734
They're
trying to Minifiler it,

05:33.734 --> 05:35.003
but it's pretty degraded.

05:35.003 --> 05:36.370
Okay.
What about the estate?

05:36.370 --> 05:38.039
Is there
a life insurance policy?

05:38.039 --> 05:39.673
Is wifey
in for a windfall?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.642
One 20-year-old term policy.
250K.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.311
What's the house worth?

05:43.311 --> 05:45.613
Ran the comps.
Last sale in that neighb,

05:45.613 --> 05:48.382
similar square footage
and view, 4.2.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.650
That's nice.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.953
Allen had a jumbo first
and a home equity loan.

05:51.953 --> 05:55.924
Say Veronica sells
for 4.4.

05:55.924 --> 05:57.625
With commissions
and capital gains,

05:57.625 --> 05:59.427
she'll be lucky
to clear 200K.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.595
I wonder why he was using
his house as an ATM.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.498
Let's keep an eye on probate,
see how the estate settles.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.634
The thing is this guy
was a money launderer.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.937
Who knows what he's got
squirreled away and where?

06:08.937 --> 06:10.738
The widow, maybe?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.640
Yeah. Maybe she does.

06:33.094 --> 06:34.963
Marsha Macken.
Leave a message.

06:34.963 --> 06:36.697
Macken, Billets.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.566
I feel like some Cajun fries.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.302
And don't fucking tell me
you're cutting out carbs.

08:01.482 --> 08:04.552
Yeah, Arceneaux
stayed in the car.

08:04.552 --> 08:07.355
So you're on tape
making the pickup.

08:07.355 --> 08:09.790
- Yep.
- Any idea how far this goes?

08:09.790 --> 08:12.793
- Who else might be involved?
- Nope.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.263
He talks about it
getting bigger from here,

08:15.263 --> 08:17.365
but I'm not even
sniffin' it.

08:17.365 --> 08:20.334
Four months, it's all
penny-ante bullshit,

08:20.334 --> 08:23.704
just rolling dealers
and stealing doughnuts.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.972
You need to be patient.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.408
We chose you
because Arceneaux owes you.

08:27.408 --> 08:29.577
You had the opportunity
to hang him out to dry

08:29.577 --> 08:31.079
back at the Academy,
and you didn't.

08:31.079 --> 08:32.813
I was just as guilty
as he was.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.182
Which is why
he trusts you now.

08:34.182 --> 08:35.983
He doesn't trust me yet.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.885
Oh, but he wants to.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.287
It's whoever else
is involved

08:39.287 --> 08:41.455
that's keeping you
at arm's length.

08:41.455 --> 08:43.291
Well,

08:43.291 --> 08:45.459
I don't know if they're
gonna let me get any closer.

08:46.494 --> 08:51.432
Look, IAD believes--
and so do I--

08:51.432 --> 08:53.901
that your greatest deficit
in this operation

08:53.901 --> 08:55.736
is also your greatest asset.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.471
That I'm your son.

08:59.107 --> 09:01.775
You prove yourself,
and they will ask you in

09:01.775 --> 09:03.377
because you're my son.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.146
What you have access to
through me is valuable.

09:05.146 --> 09:06.714
They'll want it.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.781
Mm-hmm.

09:10.518 --> 09:12.420
You know I have to
talk shit about you.

09:12.420 --> 09:16.690
Oh, yeah, I mean
run you down 24/7.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.260
Don't tell me
you don't enjoy that.

09:19.260 --> 09:21.729
Hey,
maybe a little bit.

09:23.331 --> 09:25.566
Son, you have to make them
believe we're estranged.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.235
That's
what will get you in--

09:27.235 --> 09:30.338
well, that and your
reputation as a cowboy.

09:30.338 --> 09:32.406
Oh, which is
way overblown.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.142
- I hope so.
- Mm-hmm.

09:34.142 --> 09:36.677
Sometimes fear
is a good thing, George.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.613
Wouldn't hurt you to have
a little more of it.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.050
Wouldn't hurt you
to have more of what?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.353
- Humility.
- Oh, well,

09:45.353 --> 09:48.021
you've never lacked
for self-confidence.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.990
- Ha ha ha!
- Yeah, well, you know,

09:49.990 --> 09:51.392
I take after you,
Mama.

09:51.392 --> 09:52.926
- Me?
- Uh-huh.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.528
What about your father?

09:54.528 --> 09:58.166
There's a difference
between confident and cocky.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.368
- Oh.
- Okay.

10:00.368 --> 10:01.835
- There is?
- Mm-hmm.

10:01.835 --> 10:02.803
Thank you.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.626
You know, I appreciate
you checking in, Detective.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.596
We're not always
extended the courtesy.

10:30.264 --> 10:32.633
There's a few things
I'm gonna need, Captain.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.802
Absolutely.

10:34.802 --> 10:38.005
- Iverson, to my office.
- Right, Captain.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.308
I'll liaise you with one
of my homicide detectives.

10:40.308 --> 10:42.943
Hey, want to see a show
while you're in town?

10:42.943 --> 10:44.111
We can get you tickets.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.079
Jersey Boys?
Celine Dion?

10:46.079 --> 10:48.549
The Cirque du Soleil
sex show? It's hot.

10:48.549 --> 10:50.618
The missus and I,
we've seen it twice.

10:50.618 --> 10:51.652
No, thanks.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.221
Yeah, Captain?

10:53.221 --> 10:55.323
John Iverson, Harry Bosch.
LAPD homicide.

10:55.323 --> 10:56.557
Call me Ivy.

10:56.557 --> 10:58.726
Detective Bosch
is working a case.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.228
The victim was here
all last week.

11:00.228 --> 11:01.395
Checked out of
the Mirage Saturday,

11:01.395 --> 11:03.096
and was murdered
Saturday night.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.698
- In L.A..
- Looks that way.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.267
So you're retracing his steps.

11:06.267 --> 11:07.668
Something like that.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.470
He did a lot
of business in Vegas.

11:09.470 --> 11:12.139
Spent a fair amount of time
here over the years.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.841
I'd like you
to help Bosch out.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.510
I've put all our resources
at his disposal.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.313
My plate's heaped to
overflowing, Captain.

11:19.313 --> 11:21.582
Henrik's on the rubber gun
squad. He's available.

11:21.582 --> 11:23.617
I'm sure
you can find the time.

11:25.286 --> 11:27.655
I was just heading
outside to grab a smoke.

11:30.824 --> 11:31.959
Thank you, Captain.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.093
Whatever we can do.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.628
Don't hesitate to ask.

11:41.269 --> 11:42.903
Don't smoke.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.538
Oh, good for you.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.775
Ah, fuck it.

11:47.775 --> 11:51.279
We lifted some good prints
off Allen's leather jacket

11:51.279 --> 11:52.846
but didn't get a hit.

11:52.846 --> 11:56.384
You still have to get printed
in Nevada for a casino job?

11:56.384 --> 11:58.419
Any kind of club or casino.

11:58.419 --> 11:59.787
We'll run 'em.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.989
We got a lot of solid citizens
the Feds don't.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.090
I also need a warrant.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.425
You want me
to write up a warrant?

12:04.425 --> 12:05.759
I'll write it up.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.528
You just have to
attach your brag sheet,

12:07.528 --> 12:09.397
- get it to a friendly judge.
- What's it for?

12:09.397 --> 12:11.365
Security footage
at the Mirage.

12:13.301 --> 12:16.504
Okay. Anything else?

12:16.504 --> 12:18.572
There's a Mexican joint
I want to check out.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.873
Let me buy you lunch.

12:19.873 --> 12:20.941
Now you're talking.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.683
Cut. Print that.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.385
Let's reset.
We'll move in closer.

12:31.385 --> 12:33.421
Mr. Markoff, the police
want a word with you.

12:33.421 --> 12:34.922
Police? Where?

12:34.922 --> 12:38.759
All the way to the top.
Back to work, guys.

12:38.759 --> 12:39.693
Detective Edgar.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.228
- Larry Markoff?
- Yeah.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.796
You direct this?

12:42.796 --> 12:43.831
I know it was lousy.

12:43.831 --> 12:46.133
I wouldn't call it a crime.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.635
You're here about Tony?

12:47.635 --> 12:49.370
We're investigating
his murder.

12:49.370 --> 12:50.704
Yeah, it's terrible.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.406
Look, I haven't seen him
in 20 years,

12:52.406 --> 12:53.707
not since we did that flick.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.042
But talk to me
about Veronica Allen.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.377
- Ronnie?
- Yeah.

12:56.377 --> 12:59.012
Manipulative, toxic bitch.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.481
But a charmer.

13:00.481 --> 13:02.483
Melted butter wouldn't
melt in her mouth.

13:02.483 --> 13:04.117
For instance?

13:04.117 --> 13:07.488
There was another actress
on the set. Sweet kid.

13:07.488 --> 13:09.857
Ronnie made a big show of
taking Shannon under her wing.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.125
And then things
started going missing--

13:12.125 --> 13:13.661
little things, girly things,

13:13.661 --> 13:16.497
like lipstick, perfume,
costume jewelry.

13:16.497 --> 13:18.432
One day Ronnie said
she needed her hair clip.

13:18.432 --> 13:20.200
So Shannon said,
"I have one in my trailer,"

13:20.200 --> 13:21.635
so they sent a P.A.
to get it.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.970
And guess
what the P.A. finds.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.171
The missing stuff.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.839
You've seen this picture.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.109
Eh, and Tony fired her.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.144
Couldn't prove it.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.480
I know
Ronnie set her up.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.014
Why would she do that?

13:34.014 --> 13:34.982
Ronnie was crazy jealous.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.617
She had to be
the center of attention.

13:36.617 --> 13:38.118
I tried to tell Tony
she was bad news.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.587
Schmuck wouldn't listen.

13:39.587 --> 13:42.390
He was totally besotted,
head over fucking heels.

13:42.390 --> 13:43.624
She feel the same about him?

13:43.624 --> 13:45.693
Hah.
He got her out of porn.

13:45.693 --> 13:47.294
He bought her a house,
a Porsche,

13:47.294 --> 13:48.496
put a ring on her finger.

13:48.496 --> 13:50.163
He was her
fucking meal ticket.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.732
That's how she
felt about him.

13:51.732 --> 13:53.467
- Maybe she loved him.
- Hah.

13:53.467 --> 13:54.802
- Ronnie?
- Yeah.

13:54.802 --> 13:57.037
No, Ronnie never loved
nobody but Ronnie.

13:58.406 --> 14:00.841
Lets go,
back to work.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.311
Today's special,
tilapia Veracruz.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.546
Something to drink?

14:05.546 --> 14:07.114
- Dos Equis.
- Just water, please.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.983
And a double order of guac
and chips, por favor.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.619
Excuse me, Miss.

14:11.619 --> 14:14.321
You recognize this man?
He ever been in here before?

14:14.321 --> 14:16.424
Sorry. I don't.

14:16.424 --> 14:18.726
You should come
back at dinner,

14:18.726 --> 14:20.027
ask the other girls.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.462
Thank you.

14:21.462 --> 14:23.130
Ring a bell for you?

14:23.130 --> 14:25.298
This your vic?

14:25.298 --> 14:27.901
He looks like
a lot of these guys.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.202
Not local.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.704
These guys?

14:30.704 --> 14:33.607
Wise guys.
Wannabe wise guys.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.643
Yeah, tell me about
the mob here.

14:35.643 --> 14:37.778
These days?
They're Russian.

14:37.778 --> 14:39.747
Scary. Yeah.

14:39.747 --> 14:41.882
Super bugs.
That's what I call 'em.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.016
Super bugs?

14:43.016 --> 14:45.085
You can't kill 'em.
They keep evolving.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.787
World class hackers,

14:46.787 --> 14:49.256
always working new ways
to wire the slots,

14:49.256 --> 14:50.858
the roulettes, hack the cash.

14:50.858 --> 14:52.626
The casinos are
shitting themselves

14:52.626 --> 14:54.027
trying to fend them off.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.896
They still into
the old-school stuff?

14:55.896 --> 14:58.298
Oh sure. Loan-sharking,
drugs, girls.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.800
Gotta keep the losers
lubricated

14:59.800 --> 15:01.835
to keep them coming back,
right?

15:01.835 --> 15:05.272
You ever hear of a strip
club called Dolly's?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.575
Dolly's.
More than a lap dance.

15:07.575 --> 15:09.710
Drugs, girls,
credit card mill.

15:09.710 --> 15:12.613
Owner's a mobster
named Joey Marks--

15:12.613 --> 15:14.281
Joe Markaryan.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.049
Armenian?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.751
Works for the Russians.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.520
My victim's Armenian,
too.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.789
Made porn, washed money.

15:21.789 --> 15:23.957
He's got some kind
of connection to Dolly's--

15:23.957 --> 15:26.960
maybe a girlfriend,
maybe more.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.497
You think he was running a
fluff 'n fold for Joey Marks?

15:29.497 --> 15:31.131
He was running one
for somebody.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.800
Club's a cash cow.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.234
Joey's got a string of 'em.

15:34.234 --> 15:38.138
All that money's gotta go
somewhere to get clean.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.207
- Ah.
- There you go.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.177
Drinks are on the house.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.579
Thank you.

15:45.579 --> 15:47.214
Muchas gracias.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.583
Used to be they'd comp you
the whole shebang.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.251
Ain't like the old days.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.720
Yeah, huh?

15:52.720 --> 15:55.122
I want to talk
to this Joey Marks.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.190
Hah.
Good luck with that.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.727
Marks keeps a very low
profile these days.

15:59.727 --> 16:01.294
Ain't been seen
in public in months.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.329
Why's that?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.697
The FBI

16:03.697 --> 16:05.966
has a huge throbbing
hard-on for this guy.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.301
They had an undercover agent
in Marks' crew.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.303
Whoo. Disappeared.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.972
Feebs think
Marks had him whacked

16:11.972 --> 16:14.007
and buried out
in the desert.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.209
Mm.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.455
Lieutenant Billets.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.390
Oh. Brasher.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.559
It's good to see you.

16:31.559 --> 16:32.960
You too, ma'am.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.094
How're things?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.563
Okay.

16:35.563 --> 16:38.365
I mean, I'd rather be
back in Hollywood, but--

16:38.365 --> 16:41.368
Well, it was a difficult
situation.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.136
Yes, it was.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.839
And all said and done, I think
you handled it pretty well.

16:45.839 --> 16:49.142
Because I didn't throw your
pal Bosch under the bus?

16:49.142 --> 16:52.580
Like I said, it was
a difficult situation.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.214
- Grace.
- Hey.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.448
Captain.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.851
Old home week?
Catching up?

16:57.851 --> 16:59.653
I haven't
seen Officer Brasher

16:59.653 --> 17:01.454
since she transferred
to Pacific.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.223
Seems to be
working out.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.758
Couldn't be happier.

17:04.758 --> 17:07.928
The lieutenant and I
were in patrol together.

17:07.928 --> 17:10.063
Yeah, back when our
male partners

17:10.063 --> 17:12.232
wouldn't let us drive
or touch the radio.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.835
We were supposed
to stay out of the way,
keep our mouths shut,

17:14.835 --> 17:16.336
- and do the paperwork.
- Mm-hmm.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.972
In some ways, things
haven't changed that much.

17:18.972 --> 17:20.140
No?

17:21.341 --> 17:22.876
Look who you're talking to.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.277
There were no
female lieutenants

17:24.277 --> 17:26.714
or captains back then.
Exactly none.

17:26.714 --> 17:28.616
And you're still a cop.

17:28.616 --> 17:30.117
In the old days,
you'd be long gone.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.453
You hungry?

17:33.453 --> 17:34.988
- Starving.
- Let's do it.

17:43.631 --> 17:44.998
I got a name off the tape.

17:44.998 --> 17:46.499
The possible girlfriend?

17:46.499 --> 17:48.535
Layla. Like the song.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.137
What song?

17:50.137 --> 17:52.039
You know,
Derek and the Dominos?

17:52.039 --> 17:54.975
Never mind.
Here's the other thing.

17:54.975 --> 17:56.877
Pretty sure I picked up
a tail somewhere.

17:56.877 --> 17:59.546
- Pretty sure?
- They're good.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.681
And I'm paranoid.

18:00.681 --> 18:02.249
Who?

18:02.249 --> 18:03.350
The Feds, I don't know.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.652
Check your car for bugs?

18:04.652 --> 18:06.053
Right.

18:06.053 --> 18:07.821
These days, they don't need
a tail to track you.

18:08.756 --> 18:10.190
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.358
Gotta go.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.526
Later.
Tell Maddie I said hey.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.162
Yep.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.264
J. Edgar says hey.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.033
What kind of camp
is this?

18:20.033 --> 18:22.202
Science, technology,
engineering, math.

18:22.202 --> 18:25.873
Wow, that's impressive.
Like, algebra?

18:25.873 --> 18:27.675
You're not serious.

18:27.675 --> 18:29.409
Algebra's not serious?

18:29.409 --> 18:32.045
Robotics? App design?
Hello.

18:32.045 --> 18:34.381
I thought you wanted
to be a cop.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.983
In case you haven't noticed,

18:35.983 --> 18:38.085
nowadays, law enforcement
is all about technology.

18:38.085 --> 18:40.453
Okay, well, that's something
we could argue about,

18:40.453 --> 18:41.855
but let's not.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.223
What do you say, ice cream?

18:43.223 --> 18:46.259
How about gelato?

18:46.259 --> 18:47.460
Gelato. Yeah.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.362
Gelato.

18:55.803 --> 18:57.370
How's Lisa?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.538
She's good.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.140
She joined the Model UN
at school.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.175
They're teaching her
how to argue.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.877
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

19:03.877 --> 19:06.013
She's a teenager. She
need lessons in arguing?

19:06.013 --> 19:07.347
I know.
It shouldn't be legal.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.049
There oughta be a law.

19:09.049 --> 19:10.918
There oughta be a law
against these fries.

19:10.918 --> 19:12.619
- I know.
- Don't let me eat them all.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.787
Ehh.

19:14.922 --> 19:17.357
You see Jake Buller
made commander?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.626
Bullshit Buller? How?

19:19.626 --> 19:20.994
No mystery.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.396
When Tenzer was Deputy
Chief of the Valley,

19:23.396 --> 19:25.365
Buller's lips were
firmly glued to his ass.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.900
Oh, my God.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.468
Speaking
of Deputy Chiefs,

19:28.468 --> 19:30.603
is it true Irving's
gonna endorse O'Shea?

19:30.603 --> 19:31.905
That's the rumor.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.173
And if O'Shea wins,

19:33.173 --> 19:35.743
he makes Irving
Chief of Police?

19:35.743 --> 19:37.845
Wouldn't be
a bad deal for you.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.347
Marsha, are you implying

19:40.347 --> 19:42.315
that my lips are glued
to Irving's ass?

19:42.315 --> 19:44.417
No, not glued.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.786
Puckered, maybe?

19:45.786 --> 19:47.387
Go fuck yourself.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.758
Seriously, you're doing
a great job, Grace.

19:50.758 --> 19:52.225
Time you moved up.

19:53.761 --> 19:55.395
Taken the captain's exam?

19:55.395 --> 19:57.464
Not yet.

19:57.464 --> 19:58.832
Should I?

19:58.832 --> 20:00.801
Irving would
put in a good word.

20:00.801 --> 20:02.169
Meet him halfway.

20:04.071 --> 20:06.706
Time you had two bars
on your collar.

20:09.042 --> 20:12.412
That business with Kiz?

20:12.412 --> 20:15.816
It was a lapse in judgment.

20:15.816 --> 20:19.086
Well you're lucky
it didn't go sideways.

20:19.086 --> 20:22.322
In the old days,
you'd be long gone.

20:29.863 --> 20:32.199
So what's the difference?

20:32.199 --> 20:34.201
First of all,
gelato has less fat,

20:34.201 --> 20:36.403
so you can really
taste the flavor.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.805
Fat's a flavor.

20:37.805 --> 20:39.106
Daddy.

20:39.106 --> 20:42.642
Secondly, the texture
is a whole lot creamier.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.045
Creamier,
definitely.

20:47.114 --> 20:49.382
So what's
going on at home?

20:49.382 --> 20:50.851
I don't know.

20:50.851 --> 20:53.186
Mom and Reggie
were arguing a lot,

20:53.186 --> 20:56.156
and then all of a sudden
he goes to Hong Kong.

20:58.859 --> 21:00.627
What were they are
arguing about?

21:00.627 --> 21:04.397
Work. The casino.
Stuff.

21:07.167 --> 21:09.169
He's coming back, Maddie.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.840
I hope so.
He keeps Mom on track.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.842
How so?

21:14.842 --> 21:17.610
When he's around,
everything just works.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.713
There's food in the fridge.
I get to camp on time.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.582
Mom is
a whole lot calmer.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.251
What's she like now?

21:24.251 --> 21:27.254
Kind of just
all over the place.

21:28.922 --> 21:30.991
And I know this is
a weird thing to say

21:30.991 --> 21:32.860
because you and Mom were
married and everything.

21:32.860 --> 21:34.862
But Reggie's a good guy.

21:34.862 --> 21:38.365
And I wouldn't
want him to, you know,

21:38.365 --> 21:40.667
leave us for good.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.870
Of course you wouldn't.

21:42.870 --> 21:44.571
I get it.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.875
And it's okay.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.642
I'm glad he's a good guy.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.511
Okay?

21:52.712 --> 21:54.014
Come on.

22:56.944 --> 22:58.378
Lieutenant.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.349
Under the shirts.

23:02.349 --> 23:04.584
Pickup's every other week.

23:07.787 --> 23:08.956
What's this?

23:08.956 --> 23:12.425
We jacked a dealer.
3 G's.

23:12.425 --> 23:13.994
My cut.

23:13.994 --> 23:15.963
It's all in here.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.768
New players?

23:21.768 --> 23:23.570
Not yet.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.406
Every time I ask him about
it, he gets a little hinky.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.408
They're still
sniffing you out.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.410
I'd be worried
if they weren't.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.411
Yeah.

23:31.411 --> 23:34.481
Don't push.
Let it come to you.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.685
What if,
at the end of the day,

23:38.685 --> 23:39.987
it's just Eddie Arceneaux?

23:39.987 --> 23:41.154
You know, no crew.

23:41.154 --> 23:43.490
He's the only one there is.

23:43.490 --> 23:46.126
I've been doing this
a long time.

23:46.126 --> 23:47.995
Trust me.

23:47.995 --> 23:49.862
Arceneaux's just
the point of the spear.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.664
Be patient.

24:40.047 --> 24:42.549
**

24:44.184 --> 24:45.552
Good evening.

24:45.552 --> 24:47.320
Can I show you
to the Champagne Room?

24:47.320 --> 24:49.056
Not big on champagne.

24:49.056 --> 24:51.058
Preferred seating?
It's a better view.

24:51.058 --> 24:52.925
I'll take the cheap seats.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.795
That'll be $30
and a two-drink minimum.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.764
Those are the cheap seats?

25:01.701 --> 25:03.070
This way.

25:11.111 --> 25:12.812
I'll send your waitress over.

25:12.812 --> 25:13.946
Enjoy the show.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.515
Thank you.

25:32.299 --> 25:34.201
Mm. Hey, sweetie.

25:34.201 --> 25:36.536
I'm Amber.
What can I get you?

25:36.536 --> 25:38.105
Fat Tire, please.

25:38.105 --> 25:40.773
Hey, is Layla
working tonight?

25:40.773 --> 25:43.976
Layla?
You a friend of hers?

25:43.976 --> 25:45.245
Friend of a friend.

25:45.245 --> 25:47.314
Tell her Tony told me
to say hello.

25:47.314 --> 25:49.349
I'll send her over.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.131
You asked for me?

26:04.131 --> 26:05.798
- Layla?
- Uh-huh.

26:05.798 --> 26:06.966
Buy me a drink?

26:06.966 --> 26:08.435
Sure.

26:08.435 --> 26:10.303
But I'd rather
take care of you

26:10.303 --> 26:11.804
than give my money
to the bar.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.773
So go light, yeah?

26:13.773 --> 26:15.708
Cosmo, please.

26:17.177 --> 26:18.745
All you girls wear this?

26:18.745 --> 26:19.779
Yeah, it's pussy dust.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.548
Sorry. Say again?

26:21.548 --> 26:23.850
It's pussy dust.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.285
Pussy dust.

26:25.285 --> 26:27.954
We get a private room,
I'll show you my pussy dust.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.722
You like to party?

26:29.722 --> 26:31.191
Who doesn't?

26:34.661 --> 26:36.229
To happy endings.

26:37.164 --> 26:38.731
I love happy endings.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.500
Who doesn't?

26:44.070 --> 26:46.173
So Tony tells me
you're a friend of his.

26:46.173 --> 26:48.275
- Who?
- Tony Allen.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.812
Oh. Goose.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.046
Yeah, I know him.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.248
Goose?

26:55.248 --> 26:56.949
Because
that's all he drinks.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.219
Vodka.
Grey Goose vodka.

26:59.219 --> 27:01.288
You're not Layla.

27:02.522 --> 27:05.292
Sure I am,
if that's what you want.

27:05.292 --> 27:07.194
What difference
does it make?

27:07.194 --> 27:09.229
Let's
just have some fun.

27:09.229 --> 27:11.198
How about a lap dance,
darlin'?

27:11.198 --> 27:12.465
I'm good.

27:13.566 --> 27:16.836
How about the girl?
This Layla?

27:21.541 --> 27:22.442
Yeah.

27:22.442 --> 27:23.943
She working tonight?

27:23.943 --> 27:25.878
She doesn't work here
anymore.

27:25.878 --> 27:26.946
Quit?

27:26.946 --> 27:28.215
Shit-canned, okay?

27:28.215 --> 27:30.383
She Tony's girl?

27:30.383 --> 27:31.584
She thinks she is.

27:31.584 --> 27:33.220
Know where I can
find her?

27:33.220 --> 27:35.788
Probably with Tony,
fucking his brains out.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.525
Thanks for the drink.

27:38.525 --> 27:39.659
I need to talk to her.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.394
Keep your fucking hands
to yourself.

27:46.599 --> 27:48.235
Hey, hands off the dancers,
asshole.

27:48.235 --> 27:49.736
Lucky wants to have
a word with you.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.504
- Who's Lucky?
- The manager.

27:51.504 --> 27:54.507
Oh, yeah? I want
to talk to him, too.

27:54.507 --> 27:58.311
This piss,
it's not Fat Tire.

27:58.311 --> 28:00.079
People don't come here
for the beer, asshole.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.281
Let's go.

28:18.331 --> 28:19.732
Yeah.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.706
You wanna touch,
you gotta pay.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.309
Done nothing but
since I walked in here.

28:29.309 --> 28:32.078
Oh. Ha ha. How much
you out, big spender?

28:32.078 --> 28:33.280
Huh? 60, 70 bucks?

28:33.280 --> 28:34.914
Is that what
this is about?

28:34.914 --> 28:35.915
You want a refund?

28:35.915 --> 28:37.317
Aah!

28:38.618 --> 28:39.686
What the fuck
did you taze him for?

28:39.686 --> 28:42.088
He's strapped, Lucky. See?

28:42.088 --> 28:43.790
Fuck. He's a cop.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.393
Christ. What are you doing,
you dumb shit?

28:46.393 --> 28:48.127
Help him up.
Help him up.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.296
Come on.

28:49.296 --> 28:51.431
You stupid--
What's that?

28:51.431 --> 28:54.066
Hieronymus Bosch.
That's a mouthful, huh?

28:54.066 --> 28:56.403
Ha ha. Fuck.

28:56.403 --> 28:58.938
Most out-of-town cops,
when they come in here,

28:58.938 --> 29:00.640
they have the courtesy
and the good sense

29:00.640 --> 29:01.908
to let us know
that they're here.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.543
Easy peasy.
You had to make it hard.

29:03.543 --> 29:05.778
I'm sorry you got tazed,
but it's on you, buddy.

29:07.146 --> 29:10.317
Joey Marks know how you
treat the customers here?

29:11.651 --> 29:12.519
Joey who?

29:12.519 --> 29:14.153
He owns this shithole.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.689
Glitter Toe Entertainment
owns this shithole,

29:16.689 --> 29:18.858
and I happen to like it.
What do you want, Detective?

29:18.858 --> 29:20.960
I'm looking for a dancer
named Layla,

29:20.960 --> 29:22.962
- a friend of Tony Allen's.
- So?

29:22.962 --> 29:27.434
So? He was murdered
in L.A. last Saturday night.

29:28.668 --> 29:30.236
No shit.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.404
Goose is cooked.

29:31.404 --> 29:33.406
Heh heh.
Good old Goose, huh?

29:33.406 --> 29:34.974
So you knew him.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.676
Yeah. Oh. yeah, I knew him.

29:36.676 --> 29:38.077
You're all busted up
about that.

29:38.077 --> 29:41.348
Asshole poached my best girls
for his crummy pornos.

29:41.348 --> 29:43.049
When was the last time
he was in here?

29:43.049 --> 29:44.250
When was that,
last Friday?

29:44.250 --> 29:45.918
He got in my grill
about Layla.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.954
- I let her go.
- Why'd you let her go?

29:47.954 --> 29:49.422
She was a bitch.

29:49.422 --> 29:51.624
She didn't get along
with the other bitches.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.726
Not like there's a lack
of trim in this city.

29:53.726 --> 29:56.162
Rolls in on the Greyhound bus
every single day.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.764
Got an address on her?

29:57.764 --> 30:00.433
I have no addresses
on any of the dancers.

30:00.433 --> 30:02.335
Bullshit.
What about payroll?

30:02.335 --> 30:03.936
No payroll.
Limited partners,

30:03.936 --> 30:06.038
every single one
of them. Dolly's LLC.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.440
They pay to dance here.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.041
And after they take care
of the bouncers,

30:09.041 --> 30:11.744
the bartenders, and the DJs,
they get to keep what's left?

30:11.744 --> 30:13.813
Look, nobody put a gun
to their head

30:13.813 --> 30:15.615
and said "You get
on that pole, bitch."

30:15.615 --> 30:17.249
They leave this place
every single night

30:17.249 --> 30:18.818
with cash stuffed
up their coozies.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.120
You don't like it, you can
report it to the IRS.

30:26.092 --> 30:28.995
Billy, why don't you show
the detective to his car?

30:30.497 --> 30:32.499
Let's go, Detective.

30:33.366 --> 30:35.234
Hey. Tell you what.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.569
Why don't you
come back, Bosch,

30:36.569 --> 30:38.037
when you can really
enjoy the show, huh?

30:38.037 --> 30:39.872
I'll comp you a lap
dance, you cheap fuck.

31:04.431 --> 31:06.065
Detective from Los Angeles.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.769
Tony Allen...

31:13.205 --> 31:14.474
Uh-huh.

31:15.775 --> 31:16.809
Hmm.

31:28.254 --> 31:29.622
Go watch the floor.

31:38.465 --> 31:40.099
That was
just a love tap, bro.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.869
Get in your ride and get
the fuck out of here.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.075
What the fuck
is your problem?

31:49.075 --> 31:51.711
I said get the fuck out.
We're done, bitch.

32:37.524 --> 32:38.991
Oh, my God.

32:38.991 --> 32:41.060
Hey, Eleanor.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.530
I see your people skills
are what they always were.

32:43.530 --> 32:45.064
You okay?

32:45.064 --> 32:46.833
I'm fine.

32:52.171 --> 32:53.540
Hey, Dad.

32:53.540 --> 32:54.741
Hey, Mads.

32:54.741 --> 32:56.576
Whoa. What happened
to your face?

32:56.576 --> 32:58.545
Some punk ambushed me.

32:58.545 --> 33:00.112
Hope you hit him back.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.614
I straightened him out.

33:01.614 --> 33:02.915
Good.

33:05.852 --> 33:06.986
Ohh.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.555
Why would you tell her that?

33:08.555 --> 33:10.389
She oughta know.
She wants to be a cop.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.759
She does?  Great.

33:12.759 --> 33:14.994
- She hasn't told you?
- I'm her mother.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.629
She doesn't
tell me anything.

33:18.865 --> 33:21.100
So what's this case
you're working on?

33:21.100 --> 33:23.736
Man named Anthony Allen was
murdered last week in L.A.

33:23.736 --> 33:25.572
Just come back
from Vegas,

33:25.572 --> 33:27.239
trying to find out
what he was up to here.

33:27.239 --> 33:30.109
You're not here to ask me
to profile somebody, are you?

33:30.109 --> 33:31.210
No.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.280
Just came to spend time
with you and Maddie,

33:34.280 --> 33:36.215
see how you're doing.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.984
We're doing fine.

33:37.984 --> 33:38.951
Good.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.589
When's Reggie coming back
from Hong Kong?

33:43.623 --> 33:45.592
Why do you ask?

33:45.592 --> 33:47.594
Just curious.

33:50.597 --> 33:52.231
Excuse me.

33:54.834 --> 33:56.368
What did she say?

33:56.368 --> 33:57.770
Not much.

33:57.770 --> 33:59.405
When's Reggie getting back?

33:59.405 --> 34:01.240
She didn't say.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.909
That sucks.

34:17.724 --> 34:19.792
I wasn't feeling well,
Charlie.

34:19.792 --> 34:21.894
He's an important client.

34:21.894 --> 34:24.897
He expects and deserves
to be treated with respect.

34:24.897 --> 34:26.633
Lucy could've
played with him.

34:26.633 --> 34:30.102
He flew in from Macao to play
with you, specifically,

34:30.102 --> 34:31.303
not Lucy.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.371
The gweipo.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.473
I never use that word.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.408
Really? Never? Bullshit.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.645
Look, I'll play with him
tonight.

34:38.645 --> 34:40.312
I'm afraid it's too late.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.781
He went
to the Bellagio.

34:41.781 --> 34:43.650
You know, I'm the one

34:43.650 --> 34:45.217
who catches hell for
this from your husband.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.654
Look, I'm sorry about that.
I really am.

34:47.654 --> 34:49.822
- I'll explain it to him.
- Is there a problem here?

34:49.822 --> 34:51.157
Stay out of this, Harry.

34:51.157 --> 34:52.659
No problem, sir.

34:52.659 --> 34:54.326
This is between me
and Mrs. Woo.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.063
Yeah, but I'm here now. I'd
like to know what's going on.

34:57.063 --> 34:58.264
Harry, please.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.168
Let me at least call
the gentleman personally

35:02.168 --> 35:03.569
and apologize.

35:03.569 --> 35:04.771
Let me
talk to Mr. Woo,

35:04.771 --> 35:06.072
and I'll
get back to you.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.245
You missed work?

35:13.245 --> 35:14.881
I didn't feel like playing

35:14.881 --> 35:17.717
with some rich, entitled
asshole from Macao, okay?

35:17.717 --> 35:19.085
Okay.

35:19.085 --> 35:21.353
You know, I don't have
to answer to you, Harry.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.923
This is my business, my life.

35:27.860 --> 35:29.929
**

35:52.551 --> 35:54.353
Second thoughts?

35:56.856 --> 35:58.991
The Mayor
made a strong pitch.

35:58.991 --> 36:02.228
I told him I'd, uh,
pray on it.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.963
Have you?

36:03.963 --> 36:06.165
What do you think
I'm doing now?

36:07.166 --> 36:10.502
Well, you could
change your mind.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.171
Yeah.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.841
But if O'Shea wins,
I'm out of a job.

36:14.841 --> 36:16.776
And if O'Shea loses--

36:16.776 --> 36:18.945
Tenzer's still Chief.

36:20.446 --> 36:22.181
The Mayor said not forever.

36:22.181 --> 36:25.918
That's not exactly
a promise, is it?

36:27.519 --> 36:29.321
No, it's not.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.225
So tell me
what I should do.

36:36.763 --> 36:39.832
Roll the dice, sweetheart.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.136
And play me
that tune of yours I like.

36:49.809 --> 36:53.913
**

37:06.926 --> 37:09.328
This is
the 20-40 table.

37:11.864 --> 37:13.800
Run it in real time.

37:15.868 --> 37:17.169
Real time.

37:17.169 --> 37:18.637
There's Allen.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.139
Correct.

37:20.139 --> 37:21.808
There's
the leather jacket.

37:21.808 --> 37:23.810
Where are you at
with those prints?

37:23.810 --> 37:25.311
You just asked for that.

37:25.311 --> 37:28.380
It's Saturday. Things
move a little slower.

37:30.049 --> 37:32.118
You got another camera
on this table?

37:32.118 --> 37:33.152
Yeah. What do you want?

37:33.152 --> 37:35.387
The woman, her face.

37:39.225 --> 37:40.059
Here you go.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.031
You know her?

37:45.031 --> 37:47.566
No. Thought I did.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.701
Facial recognition
specialist is pretty good.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.438
You give him a few minutes,
he can probably ID her for you.

37:52.438 --> 37:55.274
No, that's all right.
Not who I thought it was.

37:59.045 --> 38:01.613
Ha ha! You are a dog.
Come on now.

38:05.551 --> 38:07.453
I knew you'd stick,
Basher.

38:07.453 --> 38:10.689
Bullshit, Edge.
You kept writing me up.

38:10.689 --> 38:11.757
You kept fucking up.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.359
Admit it.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.761
You thought I was a washout
from day one.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.496
A little dilettante,

38:17.496 --> 38:19.866
little rich white girl
looking to get kicks.

38:19.866 --> 38:20.967
- Not true.
- Mm-hmm.

38:20.967 --> 38:22.334
I thought you'd
make a good cop

38:22.334 --> 38:24.370
if you just stopped shooting
yourself in the foot.

38:24.370 --> 38:25.437
So to speak.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.506
Sorry. Didn't mean it
that way.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.976
No, it's cool. It's cool.
My cross to bear.

38:29.976 --> 38:31.343
Just gotta live with it.

38:31.343 --> 38:34.613
People will forget about it,
eventually, over time.

38:34.613 --> 38:37.449
Yeah, I hope so.

38:37.449 --> 38:40.086
Hey. This one's on me.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.691
Mm. Julia.

38:45.691 --> 38:46.993
George.

38:46.993 --> 38:48.627
Rhodes. What's up?

38:48.627 --> 38:49.896
Brasher.

38:49.896 --> 38:51.663
Hey. How's Pacific?

38:51.663 --> 38:53.632
Cool. Yeah.
Pacific's cool.

38:53.632 --> 38:54.700
Okay.

38:54.700 --> 38:55.935
Come on down to Muscle Beach.

38:55.935 --> 38:57.103
We'll work out, you know?

38:57.103 --> 38:58.804
- You could use it.
- Whoo!

38:58.804 --> 39:01.941
- You got jokes.
- What are you doing
in the hood?

39:01.941 --> 39:04.576
Ask you the same. You're
downtown now, right?

39:04.576 --> 39:06.378
Van Nuys. Narcotics.

39:06.378 --> 39:08.580
Oh, I heard
you were on a desk.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.350
What can I say?
They need me on the street.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.085
Hey.

39:13.085 --> 39:15.521
Now, I'll get that drink,
sir. Thank you.

39:15.521 --> 39:16.722
Uh, Edgewood's, too?

39:16.722 --> 39:18.124
Of course.

39:18.124 --> 39:20.059
Of course. Hey, Rhodes.

39:20.059 --> 39:21.327
- Uh-uh.
- Come on. One more?

39:21.327 --> 39:23.495
- One more?
- I'm driving, brother.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.797
You ain't nowhere
near .08, brother.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.234
I'm getting there fast, man.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.570
Hey, Julia,
it was nice seeing you.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.072
You too, Victor.
You too.

39:33.072 --> 39:35.641
- Be safe, man.
- Vic, hey, okay?

39:35.641 --> 39:36.943
All right now.

39:36.943 --> 39:38.577
Two Wild Turkeys, rocks.

39:38.577 --> 39:39.979
No, doubles. My tab.

39:39.979 --> 39:41.280
Pair of double Turkeys
on the rocks.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.982
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, George.

39:42.982 --> 39:47.319
Mm-hmm. Mm. You, uh--
You miss Hollywood?

39:47.319 --> 39:49.989
Because
I sure as shit don't.

39:49.989 --> 39:51.323
Really?

39:51.323 --> 39:54.126
You're not bored
in the Valley?

39:54.126 --> 39:57.296
Shit, no.
The Valley is back alley.

39:57.296 --> 39:59.498
- Pssht. It's sick.
- Really?

39:59.498 --> 40:02.468
Oh, but Hollywood
is for the turistas.

40:02.468 --> 40:05.271
It's like a fucking sea cruise
compared to the Valley.

40:05.271 --> 40:07.373
- Shit.
- Sounds like it suits you.

40:07.373 --> 40:09.508
Mm.

40:10.943 --> 40:12.711
And I get off on it.

40:12.711 --> 40:15.281
I do. I'm telling you.

40:15.281 --> 40:18.617
Street--
Street adrenaline?

40:18.617 --> 40:20.552
Oh. No high like it.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.721
I get that. I do.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.656
Double Turkeys.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.725
- Mm.
- Thank you.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.127
Yes, yes.

40:28.127 --> 40:29.195
Thanks again, George.

40:29.195 --> 40:30.429
Oh, yeah. Cheers, baby.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.031
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

40:32.031 --> 40:33.599
Be good.

40:33.599 --> 40:38.170
Mm-hmm. Mm. Ahh.

40:38.170 --> 40:42.441
The prophet Amos

40:42.441 --> 40:48.614
chastised the rich
and powerful of Samaria

40:48.614 --> 40:51.283
for living in luxury

40:51.283 --> 40:55.021
while they ignored the poor

40:55.021 --> 40:58.624
and turned their backs
on the helpless.

41:00.159 --> 41:04.563
It is the duty
of every one of us

41:04.563 --> 41:07.433
to heed the cry of Amos.

41:07.433 --> 41:09.101
- That's right.
- Yes, man.

41:09.101 --> 41:13.205
Let justice roll on
like a river,

41:13.205 --> 41:18.277
righteousness like
a never-failing stream.

41:18.277 --> 41:20.579
Amen.

41:24.683 --> 41:27.819
I grew up here,
this neighborhood.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.256
This was my family's church.

41:30.256 --> 41:33.259
Greater Page Temple
of God In Christ.

41:33.259 --> 41:35.294
We were here every Sunday--

41:35.294 --> 41:37.263
not just Christmas and Easter,

41:37.263 --> 41:38.697
every Sunday.

41:38.697 --> 41:41.567
And so I can think
of no more fitting place

41:41.567 --> 41:44.470
for me to endorse the next
mayor of our great city,

41:44.470 --> 41:46.505
Richard O'Shea.

41:50.642 --> 41:52.078
Thank you.

41:52.078 --> 41:54.413
Thank you,
Deputy Chief Irving.

41:54.413 --> 41:56.382
And thank you, Reverend Ott,

41:56.382 --> 41:57.983
for your hospitality

41:57.983 --> 42:02.088
and for that stirring
sermon on social justice.

42:02.088 --> 42:05.091
As we look to the future,
let us keep that--

42:05.091 --> 42:07.093
That prick.

42:07.093 --> 42:10.096
He never had any intention
of supporting me.

42:10.096 --> 42:11.730
"Pray on it," my ass.

42:13.165 --> 42:16.235
I think we need to
express our displeasure,

42:16.235 --> 42:17.669
send him a message.

42:19.905 --> 42:21.240
Yeah.

42:22.674 --> 42:24.310
I'm done.

42:24.310 --> 42:26.945
You hardly ate anything.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.747
I'm not hungry.

42:28.747 --> 42:30.282
It's your favorite.

42:30.282 --> 42:31.983
Not every night
it's not.

42:31.983 --> 42:34.520
Come on. We don't have
pizza every night.

42:34.520 --> 42:37.223
We do when Reggie's
not here.

42:37.223 --> 42:39.125
He makes dinner.

42:39.125 --> 42:42.594
Hey, it's no secret
I'm no cook.

42:42.594 --> 42:45.597
And he's a wizard
in the kitchen.

42:45.597 --> 42:46.832
I have homework.

42:46.832 --> 42:49.135
What, camp homework?

42:49.135 --> 42:51.237
I thought summer camp
was supposed to be fun.

42:51.237 --> 42:52.904
Me, too.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.640
You wanted to go there.

42:56.742 --> 42:59.211
Oh, my God.

42:59.211 --> 43:02.514
I swear, I am
so sick of her moods.

43:02.514 --> 43:05.417
Now she's complaining
about STEM camp.

43:09.521 --> 43:12.724
Eleanor, why didn't you
tell me you knew Anthony Allen?

43:12.724 --> 43:14.059
Who?

43:14.059 --> 43:16.027
My murder victim.
The case I'm working.

43:16.027 --> 43:17.963
Anthony Allen.

43:17.963 --> 43:19.631
I don't know him.

43:19.631 --> 43:21.467
I saw video of you

43:21.467 --> 43:23.469
playing poker with him
at the Mirage last week

43:23.469 --> 43:26.572
at the 20-40 table,
whatever the fuck that is.

43:26.572 --> 43:29.275
Wait, you mean Tony?
That's your victim?

43:29.275 --> 43:30.376
Come on, Eleanor.

43:30.376 --> 43:31.943
No, I hardly knew him.

43:31.943 --> 43:33.345
I only saw him
at the tables.

43:33.345 --> 43:35.046
I didn't even know
his last name.

43:35.046 --> 43:36.382
He was just Tony.

43:36.382 --> 43:38.884
Well, you were just
chatting away like old pals.

43:38.884 --> 43:41.019
That's because if you played
poker once in a while,

43:41.019 --> 43:43.222
you'd know. Perfect strangers
can get very chummy

43:43.222 --> 43:44.556
over a hand of cards.

43:44.556 --> 43:46.758
What were you doing
at the Mirage?

43:46.758 --> 43:49.328
Jesus, Harry,
I was there to unwind.

43:49.328 --> 43:50.729
I do that sometimes.

43:50.729 --> 43:53.599
You unwind from playing poker
by playing poker?

43:53.599 --> 43:55.234
That sounds like
a compulsion to me.

43:55.234 --> 43:58.504
God, you can be
such an asshole sometimes.

43:58.504 --> 44:00.239
Never miss a chance
to make me feel stupid.

44:00.239 --> 44:02.274
Where is this coming from?

44:02.274 --> 44:04.243
I see it all over your face.
You're out there

44:04.243 --> 44:06.345
doing important work,
meaningful work.

44:06.345 --> 44:08.046
And me,
I'm just a hustler,

44:08.046 --> 44:09.281
a casino shill
in an evening gown.

44:09.281 --> 44:10.449
You know that's not
what I think.

44:10.449 --> 44:12.218
That's exactly what you think.

44:12.218 --> 44:14.420
Jesus, Eleanor.
I'm worried about you.

44:14.420 --> 44:16.622
You're missing work.
Your husband's out of town,

44:16.622 --> 44:18.290
and you don't know
when he's coming back.

44:18.290 --> 44:19.625
You are erratic.

44:22.928 --> 44:24.563
Talk to me.

44:25.864 --> 44:27.399
Go away, Harry.

44:27.399 --> 44:29.568
You're just making
things worse.

45:09.908 --> 45:11.910
Be patient.

45:11.910 --> 45:14.079
You are my son.

45:14.079 --> 45:16.348
Fear is a good thing.

45:16.348 --> 45:18.750
Be patient.

45:18.750 --> 45:20.986
You are my son.

45:20.986 --> 45:23.355
Fear is a good thing.

45:23.355 --> 45:25.291
Be patient.

45:26.292 --> 45:27.626
Be patient.

45:28.694 --> 45:29.995
Be patient.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.864
You are my son.

45:32.864 --> 45:34.966
You are my son.

45:34.966 --> 45:37.068
You are my son.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.637
You are my son.
