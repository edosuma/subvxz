00:23.815 --> 00:26.026

00:26.026 --> 00:27.152
Who's that?

00:27.152 --> 00:29.279
Evie:
Allie, Alice in
Wonderland's daughter.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.240
A girl's gotta know
her competition.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.117
Or, in this case,
her "not‐etition."

00:34.117 --> 00:36.620
Get it? Because she's
not competition.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.663
I gots.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.414
I think living in Auradon
is getting to you.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.500
You really need to stop
with the made‐up words.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.876
Whyzies?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.378
Hey, Allie,
you okay?

00:44.378 --> 00:47.798
No! My partner lost her voice
and can't sing tonight!

00:47.798 --> 00:49.424
I need to find
a new partner now,

00:49.424 --> 00:52.219
or my chances of winning
go down the rabbit hole.

00:52.219 --> 00:55.055
You shrink one guy's head
and no one wants to sing
with you.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.766
Allie doesn't have a partner.
Why don't you two sing together?

00:57.766 --> 01:00.394
A VK?
Are you magical?

01:00.394 --> 01:03.188
Do you sprout horns?
Just how evil are you?

01:03.188 --> 01:04.564
I don't think
I can sing with her.

01:04.564 --> 01:07.317
If I hit a wrong note,
she might turn me into a frog.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.235
Never.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.487
I'd just shrink your head
like my last partner.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.531
Oh, it's disgusting!

01:12.531 --> 01:13.991
But curious.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.033
Can I touch it?

01:15.033 --> 01:17.286
Eww. Can you guys talk about
this somewhere else?

01:17.286 --> 01:18.287
We're up first.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.497
