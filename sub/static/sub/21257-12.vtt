WEBVTT

00:07.441 --> 00:08.676
Morning, Squirtle.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.244
Good morning, my girlfriend.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.845
I saved you
the Sunday crossword.

00:11.879 --> 00:14.315
Aww, you're so thoughtful.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.716
Oatmeal and soy sauce again?

00:15.749 --> 00:17.351
Mm-hmm. I love it.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.087
Well, everyone
has their thing.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.754
Oh, could you
grab me a pencil?

00:20.788 --> 00:23.091
I could, and I would,
and I would love to.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.794
**

00:37.037 --> 00:39.039
What the--
Oh!

00:39.073 --> 00:40.841
You found my moon landing
literature.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.443
Fascinating, right?

00:42.476 --> 00:45.946
Melinda, do you think
the moon landing was faked?

00:45.979 --> 00:47.948
Uh, yeah, don't you?

00:47.981 --> 00:50.718
Come on, Adam, I thought
you questioned everything.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.686
I do, but this

00:52.720 --> 00:54.622
is a straight-up
conspiracy theory.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.457
What's so bad about
conspiracy theories?

00:56.490 --> 00:59.293
They can be fun.
No, conspiracy theories
are dangerous,

00:59.327 --> 01:02.062
and irrational
and just plain wrong.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.265
The moon landing
definitely happened.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.966
Oh yeah? Then prove it.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.802
I can't believe this,
but I guess I have to.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.238
Hi, I'm Adam Conover

01:10.271 --> 01:11.905
and this is
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:11.939 --> 01:14.275
**

01:22.116 --> 01:24.585
Okay, explain it to me
one more time.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.555
Why do you think
the moon landing was faked?

01:27.588 --> 01:30.658
We're both skeptics, right?
So think about it skeptically.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.493
There's no way NASA
had the technology

01:32.526 --> 01:33.661
to go to the moon.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.329
They just filmed it
on a sound stage,

01:35.363 --> 01:36.597
that would've been
way easier.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.832
Yeah, that's what
conspiracy theorists think.

01:38.866 --> 01:42.336
But the truth is faking
the moon landing in 1969

01:42.370 --> 01:43.904
actually would have been harder

01:43.937 --> 01:46.640
than just going to the moon
in the first place.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.176
Here, I'll show you.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.179
Fake Moon Landing, take one.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.181
All right, in this scene
you're on the moon

01:53.214 --> 01:55.683
and it's real
and we're fooling America

01:55.716 --> 01:58.018
and action!

01:58.051 --> 02:00.020
See?
Stanley Kubrick just shot

02:00.053 --> 02:01.855
a guy jumping around on set

02:01.889 --> 02:03.257
and then they played it
back on TV.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.092
Sorry, but given
the filmmaking

02:05.125 --> 02:06.927
and lighting technology
at the time,

02:06.960 --> 02:09.029
that actually wouldn't
have been possible.

02:09.062 --> 02:12.200
Right, the lighting.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.202
Look at how bright it is.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.469
Look at these shadows.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.171
This was clearly shot
in a studio.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.372
(lights powering on)

02:18.406 --> 02:20.208
(man)
Actually...

02:20.241 --> 02:21.375
creating that lighting
would've been

02:21.409 --> 02:23.311
essentially impossible
in a studio.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.145
Melinda, meet Mark Schubin.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.715
He's a forensic
motion picture analyst

02:27.748 --> 02:29.049
and an Emmy-winning
light fellow

02:29.082 --> 02:31.952
of the Society of Motion Picture
and Television Engineers.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.555
Thanks, Adam.
Using image forensics,

02:34.588 --> 02:35.823
I can tell you that
the light source

02:35.856 --> 02:38.025
we see in the moon footage
is actually

02:38.058 --> 02:40.228
parallel sun rays
with no diffusion.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.231
If you look at the photos
from the Apollo mission,

02:43.264 --> 02:45.866
you can see that
all the shadows are parallel

02:45.899 --> 02:50.037
because the light source is
93 million miles away.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.573
(Adam)
But if you try to recreate
that same photo

02:52.606 --> 02:56.677
using studio lighting,
the shadows diverge.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.347
Huh...
Back in the '60s,

02:59.380 --> 03:01.181
the only way to recreate
that effect would be

03:01.215 --> 03:03.684
to build a wall of millions
of laser lights

03:03.717 --> 03:04.918
so close together,
they'd be like

03:04.952 --> 03:06.920
pixels on a TV screen.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.856
No, no, no, no, no!

03:08.889 --> 03:10.658
This lighting is all wrong!

03:10.691 --> 03:12.893
I need lasers, Peter! Lasers!

03:14.895 --> 03:17.097
But lasers back then
were big and costly,

03:17.130 --> 03:20.768
so rigging together
that many of that size

03:20.801 --> 03:22.903
would've required
an enormous apparatus

03:22.936 --> 03:26.106
that probably would've cost more
than the entire Apollo project.

03:26.139 --> 03:29.209
Perfect! This is great!

03:29.243 --> 03:31.245
Now we just need
millions of these lasers.

03:31.279 --> 03:34.415
Oh, uh, I don't know
if that's in our budget...

03:34.448 --> 03:37.217
Or the country's.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.052
Honestly, Peter...

03:39.086 --> 03:41.221
you make me furious.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.790
(Mark)
And in those days,

03:42.823 --> 03:45.793
the only lasers that were
practically available were red.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.696
Which means that color photos
we have from the moon landing

03:48.729 --> 03:50.698
would have been impossible.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.133
I can't shoot in red light!

03:53.166 --> 03:55.703
It makes this moon
look like a bordello!

03:55.736 --> 03:57.971
Correction!
We need millions

03:58.005 --> 04:01.141
of ultra rare,
multi-colored lasers.

04:01.174 --> 04:04.412
How do I explain... I mean,
that's not even a remotel--

04:04.445 --> 04:07.214
(high-pitched voice)
"How do I explain...
Even a remotely..."

04:07.247 --> 04:09.717
Go back to film school, Peter!

04:09.750 --> 04:11.619
Now today, we could recreate

04:11.652 --> 04:13.721
the correct lighting
with computer graphics.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.725
But in 1969,
those didn't exist.
Hmm.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.760
I've asked my colleagues
in forensics

04:19.793 --> 04:22.796
and in movie production and
given the parallel light rays

04:22.830 --> 04:26.166
and the detailed color photos,
we just cannot think of

04:26.199 --> 04:27.935
any way they could've faked
the moon landing

04:27.968 --> 04:29.837
with the technology
they had at the time.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.473
Hmm...
Thanks, Mark.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.141
Convinced?

04:34.174 --> 04:36.777
Maybe that's what
they want you to think.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.179
What if NASA secretly
created computer graphics

04:39.212 --> 04:41.081
and just kept it
from us for 40 years?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.183
Well, then an astronomical
number of people

04:43.216 --> 04:45.018
would've had to
keep that secret.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.855
Like over 400,000
NASA employees...

04:47.888 --> 04:50.858
You want all 400,000 of us
to keep our mouths shut?

04:50.891 --> 04:53.861
Yes, please.
Good luck.
We love gossip.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.029
(Adam)
... Scientists from Australia,
Spain and England

04:56.063 --> 04:57.765
who said they
independently picked up

04:57.798 --> 04:59.967
the moon landing
transmission from space...

05:00.000 --> 05:01.835
And why would we
lie for you?

05:01.869 --> 05:04.004
You're always making fun
of our Vegemite.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.507
(Adam)
... And the Russians,
our Space Race rivals

05:06.540 --> 05:08.709
who had every reason
to prove us wrong.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.811
It's been 50 years,
and we haven't even

05:10.844 --> 05:12.546
claimed that you faked it.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.882
You beat us
fair and square this time.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.650
But we'll get you back...
(snickering)

05:16.684 --> 05:19.387
in 2016!

05:19.420 --> 05:22.289
But where's the tangible proof
that we went to the moon, huh?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.792
There isn't any.
Actually, there is.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.560
While the astronauts
were on the moon,

05:26.594 --> 05:28.396
they laid out
a reflective material

05:28.429 --> 05:30.330
called retro reflectors.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.400
So today,
when an observatory on Earth

05:32.433 --> 05:34.067
aims a high-powered laser
at them,

05:34.101 --> 05:35.335
it bounces right back.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.573
Cut! Cut! Shut it down!

05:39.607 --> 05:40.908
This is impossible!

05:40.941 --> 05:42.676
Oh, no, no, no! Wait!

05:42.710 --> 05:44.878
It still could have
been faked.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.381
All you'd have to do is
secretly develop

05:47.415 --> 05:50.984
computer graphics technology
decades ahead of its time,

05:51.018 --> 05:53.854
convince multiple governments
to lie on our behalf,

05:53.887 --> 05:56.390
and then somehow get
retro reflectors

05:56.424 --> 05:59.827
to the moon without
actually going there.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.529
You could that, right?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.697
Forget it, lady.
It'd be easier to

06:03.731 --> 06:05.733
put a man on the moon.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.438
At the end of the day,
the evidence against

06:10.471 --> 06:12.840
the hoax hypothesis
is so overwhelming,

06:12.873 --> 06:15.776
you just have to accept
the simpler explanation.

06:15.809 --> 06:20.047
In 1969,
humans landed on the moon.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.381
Nope.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.350
What?
I'm not convinced.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.886
But I gave you facts,
and an expert

06:25.919 --> 06:28.121
and a comprehensive
list of citations.

06:28.155 --> 06:31.258
I'm sorry, it just
feels fishy to me.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.893
Why are you so upset
I believe this anyway?

06:32.926 --> 06:34.895
It's not like
conspiracy theories hurt anyone.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.464
Oh, no, that's not true.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.966
Conspiracy theories
can destroy lives.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.134
We're not making it to the
farmers market today are we?

06:41.168 --> 06:42.503
No, we're not.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.310
I can't believe you still think
the moon landing was faked.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.079
Come on,
what's the big deal?

06:52.112 --> 06:53.714
Conspiracy theories
are harmless.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.916
No, they definitely aren't.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.586
Let me tell you the story
of one conspiracy theory

06:58.619 --> 07:00.654
that destroyed
dozens of lives.

07:00.688 --> 07:04.057
And to do it, we'll have
to go back to the 1980s.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.893
**

07:05.926 --> 07:07.828
Aww, no rad '80s wardrobe?

07:07.861 --> 07:09.429
Sorry, how about a scrunchie?

07:09.463 --> 07:11.098
Ooh, thank you!

07:11.131 --> 07:13.066
Aww, what a cute
little daycare center.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.068
(children giggling)

07:15.102 --> 07:17.805
This daycare center
is a conspiracy

07:17.838 --> 07:19.840
to abduct children
and use them

07:19.873 --> 07:23.811
as blood sacrifices
for Satanic rituals!

07:23.844 --> 07:25.846
Okay, well that
is clearly insane.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.315
Yep, but at the time
most of America

07:28.348 --> 07:30.183
actually believed it.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.254
There is no question
that something

07:34.287 --> 07:35.789
is going on out there.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.124
(reporter)
Nationwide, we found that

07:37.157 --> 07:39.927
minor cases of Satanic activity
light up the map.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.763
These 12-year-old boys
with their parents' consent

07:42.796 --> 07:44.197
demonstrated how
they were taught

07:44.231 --> 07:46.299
to inflict pain
on their enemies.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.101
(reporter #2)
Contemporary Satanism
relies heavily

07:48.135 --> 07:50.671
on bizarre and sometimes
bloody ceremonies.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.306
The ideal sacrifice,
we are told,

07:53.340 --> 07:55.609
apparently requires babies.

07:55.643 --> 07:59.547
Oh! Oh yeah! Tuck--

07:59.580 --> 08:02.315
Sorry, taped over
my Jazzercise video.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.984
It may seem silly today,

08:04.017 --> 08:05.986
but at the time a survey found

08:06.019 --> 08:10.724
that 70% of Americans believed
Satanic ritual abuse was real.

08:10.758 --> 08:13.226
But after investigating
the matter for a decade,

08:13.260 --> 08:14.962
the FBI reported...

08:14.995 --> 08:16.664
(cameras clicking)

08:24.605 --> 08:25.639
(slurping)

08:25.673 --> 08:26.974
Baby breeding?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.909
So were the babies
breeding with each other?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.411
Or-- Wait, no,
this is crazy.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.013
Why did so many people
believe this?

08:33.046 --> 08:35.082
Well, the whole
Satan-palooza started

08:35.115 --> 08:37.250
because one guy lied
to get attention.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.752
Typical.

08:38.786 --> 08:41.755
(Adam)
In 1972, a man
named Mike Warnke

08:41.789 --> 08:43.924
wrote a memoir called
"The Satan Seller"

08:43.957 --> 08:47.294
about his supposed past
in an evil Satanic cult.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.041
That's gross.
And a lie.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.844
In 1992,
investigative journalists

09:03.877 --> 09:06.279
exposed Warnke
as a total fraud.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.281
And now he's
a stand-up comedian.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.718
What is daylight savings time?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.352
And if we're saving
so much of it,

09:12.385 --> 09:14.688
who's got it all?
(crickets chirping)

09:14.722 --> 09:17.457
Ugh, I think I liked
his old stuff better.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.792
Well, it was too late.
Warnke's fake memoir

09:18.826 --> 09:22.562
went viral
and inspired copycats.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.765
"Satanic cults are
kidnapping our children

09:24.798 --> 09:26.734
for blood sacrifices"?

09:26.767 --> 09:30.137
And it's happening
in our daycare centers!

09:30.170 --> 09:33.040
What?
(Melinda)
Yeah, about that...

09:33.073 --> 09:35.709
Why daycare centers?
Well, daycares were

09:35.743 --> 09:37.711
a relatively new
industry in the '80s

09:37.745 --> 09:40.313
and a lot of people weren't
comfortable with the idea.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.282
So when
the Satanic Panic hit,

09:42.315 --> 09:44.451
they were
the perfect scapegoats.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.586
Why do you wanna take care
of kids so bad, huh?

09:46.620 --> 09:50.824
So you can fatten 'em up
for Beelzebub's barbeque?

09:50.858 --> 09:52.159
She's a Satanist.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.861
No, I'm Episcopalian!

09:55.362 --> 09:58.498
Conspiracy theorists started
targeting daycare workers

09:58.531 --> 10:01.068
and unfortunately,
so did the police.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.736
(siren wailing)

10:02.770 --> 10:05.338
(Adam)
Of course, police couldn't
find any physical evidence

10:05.372 --> 10:07.474
of Satanic rituals
at daycare centers.

10:07.507 --> 10:10.744
So instead, they relied on
statements made by kids.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.746
(sniffs)

10:12.780 --> 10:15.916
No goats blood,
no baby's bones.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.418
Guess we're gonna have to...

10:18.451 --> 10:20.754
interrogate small children.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.856
(Adam)
Some cops were so convinced
the cults were real,

10:22.890 --> 10:24.457
they questioned kids
over and over

10:24.491 --> 10:26.126
until they got
the answers they wanted.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.161
I have to go,
I have to go!

10:28.195 --> 10:30.964
Well, you can go "potty"
after you admit

10:30.998 --> 10:33.633
your teacher's
a Satanist, Anne.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.870
Okay, she worships the devil

10:36.904 --> 10:38.538
and then I saw her
kissing the devil

10:38.571 --> 10:40.708
and she got meetings
with the devil!

10:40.741 --> 10:43.043
I knew it, you freak!
No, no, no!

10:43.076 --> 10:45.746
Come on, let's go!
Wait, I'm an Episcopalian!

10:49.416 --> 10:51.985
This practice quickly
spun out of control

10:52.019 --> 10:54.688
and childcare providers
across the country

10:54.722 --> 10:57.991
were falsely accused
of Satanic abuse.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.961
In total, more than
70 people were convicted

11:00.994 --> 11:03.731
for horrific crimes
they didn't commit.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.466
70?
They were later exonerated,

11:06.499 --> 11:10.704
but not before some had spent
more than 20 years in prison.

11:10.738 --> 11:14.507
They lost their homes,
their businesses, their freedom,

11:14.541 --> 11:16.643
all because of one
conspiracy theory

11:16.676 --> 11:18.746
that was never
even remotely true.

11:18.779 --> 11:22.850
That's terrible.
Yeah, it is.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.919
The stark truth is
this old-fashioned witch hunt

11:25.953 --> 11:27.921
actually happened
in America

11:27.955 --> 11:30.423
just a handful
of years ago.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.193
We'd all love to believe
that conspiracy theories

11:33.226 --> 11:36.429
are just harmless ideas
held by a few silly kooks.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.598
But if we're not careful,
they can take over

11:38.631 --> 11:40.500
the minds of the entire nation

11:40.533 --> 11:43.670
and lead us to persecute
our own fellow citizens.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.407
You're right.
Ideas can really hurt people.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.676
We have to be sure
what we believe is true.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.178
Good. I'm so glad that y--

11:51.211 --> 11:53.180
And I'm not sure
we landed on the moon.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.783
Really? Still?

11:55.816 --> 11:57.384
Adam, let it go.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.053
I'm just too skeptical
and rational to believe it.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.790
No, you don't believe it
because you're just the victim

12:02.823 --> 12:05.125
of the human brain's
faulty wiring.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.027
And that's what makes
everyone susceptible

12:07.060 --> 12:08.428
to conspiracy theories.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.897
Even you.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.264
I'm so sorry.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.969
Adam, just drop it.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.405
You're not gonna convince me
the moon landing wasn't faked.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.606
I've thought it through,

12:19.639 --> 12:20.974
and it's the most
rational conclusion.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.076
No, I'm afraid it isn't.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.879
Conspiracy theories feel
like they're rational,

12:25.913 --> 12:28.648
but that's because our brains
are hardwired in a way

12:28.681 --> 12:32.119
that causes us to make
cognitive mistakes.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.054
Humans are generally
very good

12:34.087 --> 12:36.156
at understanding
the world around us.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.992
We look for cause and effect,
we seek out patterns,

12:39.026 --> 12:42.495
and we ask why events happened
and who caused them.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.999
But those same impulses are also
subject to cognitive biases that

12:46.033 --> 12:49.669
can cause us to come up
with incorrect theories
about the world.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.504
For example...

12:51.538 --> 12:54.607
It makes us uncomfortable
when events are random

12:54.641 --> 12:58.178
so we tend to look for patterns
where they don't exist.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.512
Place your bets.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.982
**

13:02.015 --> 13:06.319
Huh, it's been
red the last ten times.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.122
We're due for a black!

13:09.156 --> 13:11.158
Put it all on black, baby!

13:12.659 --> 13:15.628
Red.
Ah, Spritz!

13:15.662 --> 13:19.032
We're also subject to what's
called intentionality bias.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.501
That means when something
negative happens to us,

13:21.534 --> 13:22.936
even when it's an accident,

13:22.970 --> 13:26.506
we tend to assume that
someone did it intentionally.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.177
I'm sorry, it got
damaged in shipping.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.182
The postal service
did this on purpose...

13:35.215 --> 13:38.251
because they want me to pay
extra for mail insurance!

13:39.586 --> 13:41.221
I'm onto your scheme!

13:41.254 --> 13:43.991
On top of this,
we're also victim

13:44.024 --> 13:46.226
to proportionality bias.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.062
Our brains crave a balance
of cause and effect

13:49.096 --> 13:51.498
so when an event
is huge and shocking,

13:51.531 --> 13:55.568
we need the cause to be
just as huge and shocking.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.737
Breaking news!
A Malaysian plane

13:57.770 --> 14:00.807
carrying over 200 passengers
has inexplicably

14:00.840 --> 14:03.310
gone lost at sea!

14:03.343 --> 14:06.546
What? I can't live in a world
where planes just malfunction

14:06.579 --> 14:09.249
and disappear for no reason!

14:09.282 --> 14:11.584
There's gotta be something
bigger behind it!

14:11.618 --> 14:15.422
When major events
are truly random,
it unnerves us.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.591
And our cognitive biases
start to take over.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.494
We begin to see patterns,
causes and effects,

14:21.528 --> 14:25.365
and shadowy actors
where none exist.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.267
Engine failure
is too simple.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.702
Maybe it got sucked
into a black hole

14:29.736 --> 14:31.504
put there by
the US government

14:31.538 --> 14:34.107
working... with Elvis!

14:34.141 --> 14:36.944
And when we're afraid
the effect intensifies.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.179
Research suggests that when
people feel threatened

14:39.212 --> 14:41.614
or out of control,
they become more prone

14:41.648 --> 14:43.383
to conspiratorial thinking.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.052
And there's evidence
that's why both

14:45.085 --> 14:47.620
Republicans and Democrats
become more susceptible

14:47.654 --> 14:50.991
to conspiracy theories
when their party loses power.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.067
How deep does this thing go?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.935
And that's why
conspiracy theories

15:01.969 --> 15:05.472
tend to form around
large, terrifying tragedies.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.974
For example...

15:07.007 --> 15:09.109
when JFK was assassinated,

15:09.142 --> 15:11.544
it was such a random
and horrific event,

15:11.578 --> 15:12.712
people couldn't believe

15:12.745 --> 15:14.781
it was the work
of just one man.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.649
(gasps)
The president was killed?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.818
It couldn't have been
just one crazy guy.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.887
There must be more to it!

15:20.920 --> 15:23.390
But when Ronald Reagan
was shot,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.925
there were no prominent
conspiracy theories.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.460
Why?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.496
Because Reagan didn't die.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.731
This made the event
less shocking,

15:31.764 --> 15:33.333
which made it easier
to accept

15:33.366 --> 15:35.268
the consensus explanation.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.670
Proportionality bias
in action.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.640
Huh, the president
was mildly injured.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.675
It sounds like it was
just one crazy guy

15:42.709 --> 15:44.244
and there's
nothing more to it.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.780
These biases are a natural part
of human cognition,

15:47.814 --> 15:49.682
which means
conspiratorial thinking

15:49.716 --> 15:52.419
isn't just for a few crazies
in tinfoil hats.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.454
We're all subject to it.

15:54.487 --> 15:59.159
51% of Americans still believe
in some JFK conspiracy theory.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.861
Take position
on the grassy knoll.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.696
And over a fifth
of Americans believe

16:03.730 --> 16:06.199
a UFO crashed at Roswell.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.468
I knew they were real!
I knew they were real!

16:08.501 --> 16:10.137
The fact is,
there's a little

16:10.170 --> 16:12.805
conspiracy theorist
in all of us.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.207
What if Melinda's right?

16:14.241 --> 16:15.942
Maybe the moon landing
was faked

16:15.975 --> 16:17.544
and my show's just
being controlled

16:17.577 --> 16:20.547
by the Illuminati!

16:20.580 --> 16:23.283
But we have to
resist that voice,

16:23.316 --> 16:25.318
because if we don't--
No!

16:25.352 --> 16:29.656
I'm the only one that sees
through the looking glass, man!

16:29.689 --> 16:31.124
Wake up, sheeple!

16:31.158 --> 16:33.293
The wool is being
pulled over your eyes

16:33.326 --> 16:36.029
and they're knitting
a sweater out your brain.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.997
Whew, looks like
I'm gonna need some help.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.301
Hey, Adam.
(gasps)
Lizard-person!

16:41.334 --> 16:44.504
No, Melinda, this is
Dr. Dan Jolley.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.639
He's a lecturer at
Staffordshire University

16:46.673 --> 16:48.208
in the UK
and an expert,

16:48.241 --> 16:50.643
in the psychology
of conspiracy theories.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.978
Melinda, it's true.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.182
We're all prone to
conspiratorial thinking.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.185
And the danger is that kind
of thinking can erode

16:58.218 --> 17:02.522
your trust in institutions
and the people around you.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.357
For example, if you
think the government

17:04.391 --> 17:06.659
is all plots and schemes,
you'll feel like

17:06.693 --> 17:09.229
nothing you do
will make a difference.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.764
So you're less likely to vote.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.434
Elections are all controlled
by the Bilderbergers.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.104
And exposure to
conspiracy theories

17:17.137 --> 17:21.441
can also make you less likely
to trust basic science.

17:21.474 --> 17:24.777
Global warming's a hoax.
And you'll be less likely

17:24.811 --> 17:27.614
to rely on proven
medical treatments

17:27.647 --> 17:30.183
in favor of hoax remedies.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.152
That's a Masonic symbol!
I know it is.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.456
The truth is,
conspiratorial thinking

17:36.489 --> 17:38.458
actually reduces your power

17:38.491 --> 17:40.627
to change the world
for the better.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.962
You begin to doubt everyone.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.964
Your friends, your family,

17:44.997 --> 17:48.301
even trusted sources
like the newspaper.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.603
And that's the greatest
irony of all.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.276
I wonder if
they're coming back.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.479
Now the truth is there are
real people in power

17:59.512 --> 18:01.714
who are trying to harm us
for their benefit.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.983
But they're not
some shadowy cabal

18:04.016 --> 18:06.052
controlling our brains
from a pyramid.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.987
Real conspiracies
are things like

18:08.020 --> 18:09.422
a California labor union

18:09.456 --> 18:11.758
that secretly
misappropriated funds,

18:11.791 --> 18:14.494
uncovered by Paul Pringle
in the "LA Times."

18:14.527 --> 18:18.498
Or how regulators in Florida
kept bad insurers open

18:18.531 --> 18:20.500
so the state
wouldn't have to pay,

18:20.533 --> 18:22.669
as reported on by
Paige St. John

18:22.702 --> 18:25.004
of the "Sarasota
Herald-Tribune."

18:25.037 --> 18:27.006
Or take any of
the marketing conspiracies

18:27.039 --> 18:28.608
we've talked about on our show

18:28.641 --> 18:32.279
which were originally uncovered
by scholars and journalists.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.748
Huh...
It is so important
to think critically

18:35.782 --> 18:37.317
and question common wisdom.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.453
But if you fall victim to these
insidious thought patterns

18:40.487 --> 18:43.656
and start distrusting
everyone and everything,

18:43.690 --> 18:46.526
you could end up disbelieving
the hardworking people

18:46.559 --> 18:49.095
who expose actual conspiracies.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.364
And that takes you
further from the truth.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.032
Not closer to it.

18:53.065 --> 18:56.436
You know what? I never
thought about it like that.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.805
You're right.
I don't want to live in a world

18:58.838 --> 19:01.140
where I don't trust anything.

19:01.174 --> 19:04.211
So, okay.
I'm not gonna believe

19:04.244 --> 19:06.479
in any of those
conspiracy theories.

19:06.513 --> 19:10.650
Oh, Melinda,
I'm so happy to hear that.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.653
Just the moon landing.
What?

19:13.686 --> 19:15.488
But I did the whole episode!

19:15.522 --> 19:16.823
That's how
it's supposed to work!

19:16.856 --> 19:18.825
Didn't I change the way
you see everything?

19:18.858 --> 19:20.159
No.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.894
This has never
happened before!

19:21.928 --> 19:23.630
Is my whole show a lie?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.198
Am I the one being ruined?

19:25.232 --> 19:28.000
(wheezing)
Okay, just calm down and
let's talk this through.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.338
Oh, boy.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.510
**

19:37.544 --> 19:39.746
Hello, everybody,
we are here behind the scenes

19:39.779 --> 19:40.913
on "Adam Ruins Everything."

19:40.947 --> 19:42.915
I am with Dr. Dan Jolley
because I have

19:42.949 --> 19:45.418
way more questions for him
about his work.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.853
Thanks for the invite,
it's so exciting

19:46.886 --> 19:48.688
to be here and talk to you
and your audience.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.723
Now, I understand
from what you've told me

19:50.757 --> 19:52.492
and I find this fascinating,

19:52.525 --> 19:54.026
that people who believe
in conspiracy theories

19:54.060 --> 19:57.096
can actually believe in two
that contradict each other.

19:57.129 --> 20:00.433
It may sound really wacky when
you first say it like that,

20:00.467 --> 20:02.269
but it's all based
around your beliefs.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.003
If your central belief
is that maybe

20:04.036 --> 20:06.706
you distrust the government,
it doesn't necessarily matter

20:06.739 --> 20:08.941
that the conspiracy theories
are contradictory

20:08.975 --> 20:11.711
as long as they support
that central belief.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.713
Earlier on our show,
we talk about how,

20:13.746 --> 20:16.449
well, if NASA faked
the moon landing,

20:16.483 --> 20:17.950
the theory there is that,
oh, they didn't have

20:17.984 --> 20:19.386
the technology,
they weren't able to do it.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.120
But then if you require that,
they actually have

20:21.153 --> 20:24.123
amazing filmmaking
faking technology.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.293
Those two ideas conflict.
Either they--
Yeah.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.728
Have a high level
of technology or they don't,

20:28.761 --> 20:30.196
but if you're distrustful
of the government,

20:30.229 --> 20:32.198
maybe you'll overlook
that contradiction--
Absolutely.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.766
As long as it makes sense
in the middle,

20:33.800 --> 20:35.802
you can endorse
multiple different things.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.770
People ask me sometimes,

20:37.804 --> 20:39.238
I've actually gotten
this question,

20:39.272 --> 20:41.708
my family member
or a loved one

20:41.741 --> 20:43.276
has really gone down
the rabbit hole

20:43.310 --> 20:46.045
of conspiracy theories
and they're saying crazy stuff.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.414
How do I get through to them?

20:47.447 --> 20:49.816
How do I talk to
that family member?

20:49.849 --> 20:51.651
I think the first thing
to really appreciate

20:51.684 --> 20:55.154
is why that person may believe
in that conspiracy theory.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.089
That person may be
just thinking

20:57.123 --> 20:59.959
about their viewpoint,
and not necessarily

20:59.992 --> 21:01.227
thinking about
the other facts.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.830
So you could maybe sort
of ask them questions--

21:03.863 --> 21:05.332
Yeah.
Rather than saying,
"Hey, this is wrong.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.667
Don't believe this."
Instead you could say,

21:07.700 --> 21:09.602
"Hey, have you thought
about looking into

21:09.636 --> 21:11.938
the author of this piece,
who's running this website?"

21:11.971 --> 21:15.908
I like that a lot-- So that
actually makes sense to me.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.777
It's very much
a trial and error
at this point.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.446
It's still kind of--
It's a new field,

21:19.479 --> 21:21.448
understanding
how to combat this.

21:21.481 --> 21:24.016
Because only a few years ago,
we thought they were harmless.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.353
Now more research
and others are showing

21:26.386 --> 21:27.854
that actually
they're quite harmful.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.456
It's thinking of,
"What can we do?"

21:29.489 --> 21:31.524
So a bit of research
that I have is that

21:31.558 --> 21:33.826
if you give someone
a counter-argument--

21:33.860 --> 21:35.161
So for example,

21:35.194 --> 21:38.264
the factual information
about vaccines--

21:38.297 --> 21:41.601
First, followed by
the conspiracy account,

21:41.634 --> 21:44.170
this appears
to give someone a shield

21:44.203 --> 21:45.605
against the conspiracy theory.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.708
It seems to improve their
intentions to vaccinate.

21:48.741 --> 21:53.045
However, if you give someone
the conspiracy theory first,

21:53.079 --> 21:56.048
followed by
that factual information,

21:56.082 --> 21:59.386
it doesn't appear to work.
Huh, so it's-- If you--

21:59.419 --> 22:01.521
If someone hears
the conspiracy theory first

22:01.554 --> 22:03.456
and then the correction,
they maybe still have

22:03.490 --> 22:04.724
the conspiracy theory
bouncing around in their heads.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.560
Absolutely.
Once it's established,

22:07.594 --> 22:09.396
it takes over
our belief system.

22:09.429 --> 22:12.899
And it's potentially quite
resistant to correction.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.635
And research has shown
that even just reading

22:15.668 --> 22:18.538
about conspiracy theories
can change the way you think

22:18.571 --> 22:19.906
without you being aware.
Wow.

22:19.939 --> 22:23.209
It's showing the hidden impact
of conspiracy theories.

22:23.242 --> 22:25.011
It often seems like
the people who are

22:25.044 --> 22:26.813
promoting
the conspiracy theories

22:26.846 --> 22:28.581
make the movies
that are fun to watch

22:28.615 --> 22:29.982
or the YouTube videos

22:30.016 --> 22:31.250
or they give
the inflammatory talks.

22:31.283 --> 22:32.585
And the people giving
the true information

22:32.619 --> 22:34.887
need to step up
and make our information

22:34.921 --> 22:37.223
more fun to experience.
Absolutely.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.492
And that potentially
is one way forward

22:39.526 --> 22:40.993
'cause it is difficult,
really,

22:41.027 --> 22:43.095
to kind of get
that information across

22:43.129 --> 22:46.098
in an accessible, engaging,
but accurate way.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.767
So even your show
is a perfect example

22:47.800 --> 22:50.603
of trying to do that--
We do our best.

22:50.637 --> 22:53.239
Getting across the psychology
and all the kind of biases

22:53.272 --> 22:55.708
as a way to make it
accessible to the audience.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.844
Well, thank you so much
for coming on the show, Dan.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.612
Well, thank you
for inviting me,
it's been great.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.481
And now, more
"Adam Ruins Everything."

23:03.883 --> 23:06.586
(heavy breathing)

23:06.619 --> 23:08.421
Here, breathe into this.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.356
Actually... most studies...

23:10.389 --> 23:11.524
advise against...

23:11.558 --> 23:12.792
using a paper bag...

23:12.825 --> 23:15.294
to treat hyperventilation.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.964
Adam, why do you do this?

23:17.997 --> 23:20.700
Why can't you just
let it go one time?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.068
I don't believe in
the moon landing.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.302
So what if I'm wrong?

23:23.335 --> 23:26.238
Because then you won't
know the truth.

23:26.272 --> 23:27.874
And it's always
better to know.

23:27.907 --> 23:31.644
Otherwise you're just going
through life being wrong.

23:31.678 --> 23:35.381
Adam, maybe everything
you said is true.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.250
But I'm not just
some person on your show.

23:38.284 --> 23:39.986
I'm your girlfriend.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.954
Sometimes you're gonna
think I'm wrong,

23:41.988 --> 23:44.323
and you're just gonna have
to be okay with that.

23:44.356 --> 23:48.060
But... I've never
done that before.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.996
I don't even know if I can.

23:50.029 --> 23:53.165
I mean, you believe
the moon landing was faked!

23:53.199 --> 23:55.334
And you eat oatmeal
with soy sauce on it.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.236
Same thing.
I don't think it is.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.405
Adam, I've tried it. It is.

23:59.438 --> 24:03.976
Hey, can you do this?
Can you let it go?

24:05.645 --> 24:09.949
Okay. I'll try. For you.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.852
Great, thank you.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.186
**

24:14.220 --> 24:16.122
Now I gotta check
my horoscope.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.124
Mercury's in retrograde!

24:18.157 --> 24:20.392
**

24:22.795 --> 24:24.597
**

24:24.631 --> 24:27.534
Hello? Hello?

24:27.567 --> 24:28.868
Can anyone help me?

24:28.901 --> 24:31.604
I seem to be stuck
in this woman's brain.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.974
Wow, she spends a lot of time
thinking about fountains.
