male narrator: In the criminal
justice system,

00:05.673 --> 00:07.341
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.676
In New York City
the dedicated detectives

00:08.709 --> 00:10.678
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.711 --> 00:12.280
are members of an elite squad

00:12.313 --> 00:14.515
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.217
These are their stories.

- [sighs]

00:28.662 --> 00:30.364
[exhales]

00:47.548 --> 00:49.083
Morning.
- Hey.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.851
- Hey, honey.
- Is that smoothie for me?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.520
- It is now.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.155
- Love the heels,
but be careful in the park.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.423
They'll catch in the grass.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.857
- Mom, I'll be fine.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.293
- [laughs]
- Love you.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.529
- Love you.
- Bye, Dad.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.796
- Where's Mom?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.665
- Left a note,
had to work a double.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.801
- Eee!

01:07.835 --> 01:09.537
- [exhales]

01:10.838 --> 01:12.473
- Okay, I'm hitting the park.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.542
[giggling]

01:15.576 --> 01:17.311
- All right, cool.
Check you later.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.249
- [laughs]

01:21.282 --> 01:23.784
- Afternoon, Darius!

01:23.817 --> 01:25.819
This yours?
- Yeah.

01:25.853 --> 01:30.691
- Keep it out of English class,
but keep drawing.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.160
You have talent.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.630
- You have talent.
- Shut up.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.634
- [laughs]
- That was nice.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.436
All right, here's your money.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.205
Here's your money.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.406
I was about to give you
a little bit more than...

01:45.439 --> 01:47.341
- There's more.
- No, that's it.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.743
What happened to the coins?
- Where's my money?

01:49.777 --> 01:51.545
- I didn't see you dancing,
little girl.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.215
- Yo, check out this dude
in the dress.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.387
- Nah, son.
That's a tore-up girl.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.523
- Only one way to find out.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.259
- Let's go home.
I'm hungry.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.527
- Hey, what's up with the skirt?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.761
- Excuse me.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.364
- He asked you a question.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.699
- You one of them he-shes?

02:11.732 --> 02:14.168
- Maybe you got a bra on
under there.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.603
- Let's see, tranny.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.238
- Nah, that can't be
a girl, man.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.739
- Nah, that's a dude.
- Get away from me.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.209
- What the hell?
Beat his ass.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.776
- Come on, slut.
- Get away.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.213
- Yo, just record it,
just record it.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.715
- Darius,
we're gonna get in trouble.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.183
- [laughs]
You want it?

02:29.217 --> 02:31.619
- That's not funny.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.255
- Okay, white girl.
- [laughs]

02:34.288 --> 02:36.424
You're not getting that camera
back, uh-uh.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.192
- Just give it back.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.660
- Aw, she likes you, Darius.

02:39.693 --> 02:40.961
- They dancing now.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.197
- Get off me, you freak.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.265
[gasping]

02:44.298 --> 02:46.634
[thud]
- [gasps]

02:57.878 --> 02:59.313
- We got to go. We got to go.
Come on.

02:59.347 --> 03:02.250
- Run.
- Come on.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.517
- Let's get out of here.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.386
- Run, man.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.288
- Come on.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.325
- Look.
Down there.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.597
- Hey.
Is she conscious?

03:16.630 --> 03:20.534
- In and out,
and she's not a she.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.735
- Transgender?

03:21.769 --> 03:23.504
- Boy dressed as a girl,
that makes him--

03:23.537 --> 03:25.339
her a special victim, right?

03:25.373 --> 03:27.007
- Yeah, good call.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.542
So, what, 4:00 in the afternoon,

03:28.576 --> 03:30.378
and these two are
the only witnesses?

03:30.411 --> 03:32.813
- Yeah, tourists, they stuck
around, said everyone else ran.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.482
- Everyone else?

03:34.515 --> 03:36.817
- Apparently three black kids
were teasing him--

03:36.850 --> 03:39.019
her--pulling up the skirt.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.289
Some others were egging them on,
recorded it.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.357
Then the vic got pushed off
the bridge and everyone ran.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.560
- What high schools
are around here?

03:46.594 --> 03:49.397
- Private, Felix Adler Academy.
Public, Shirley Chisholm.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.998
- Three guesses
which kids went where.

03:55.536 --> 03:58.506
[dramatic music]

03:58.539 --> 04:06.614
*

04:43.116 --> 04:45.319
I was taking pictures
on the bridge

04:45.353 --> 04:46.587
when they surrounded me.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.922
- Avery, can you describe them?

04:48.956 --> 04:52.393
- Black, my age.

04:52.426 --> 04:56.029
[inhales]
They were giving me the look.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.465
- What look is that?

04:58.966 --> 05:03.371
- The "freak needs to learn
a lesson" look.

05:07.841 --> 05:12.546
I tried to go,
but they started saying stuff.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.014
- What were they saying?

05:15.949 --> 05:18.952
- Tranny.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.990
He-she.
My personal fave.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.730
I told them to leave me alone.

05:29.763 --> 05:33.333
One grabbed my skirt,
another my camera.

05:35.903 --> 05:39.473
I was pushed,
and I tripped on my heels.

05:41.575 --> 05:45.613
- Avery, can you remember
anything else about the boys,

05:45.646 --> 05:50.618
anything they said
or that they did?

05:50.651 --> 05:53.821
- It was all a blur of shoving,

05:53.854 --> 05:58.459
people laughing, taking video.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.061
- This isn't the first time,

06:01.094 --> 06:04.097
and the local precinct
never follows up.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.933
- We will.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.936
We take this very seriously.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.871
I give you my word, Mr. Parker.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.876
You got something?

06:15.909 --> 06:17.411
- Well, we were
checking social media,

06:17.445 --> 06:19.513
lensing the area
where the crime occurred,

06:19.547 --> 06:20.981
and these finally popped up.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.451
- "These"?

06:23.484 --> 06:25.953
- Three separate
cell phone videos so far.

06:25.986 --> 06:29.690
They all begin after it started,
but you get the idea.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.459
- Let's see, slut.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.694
What's under there?
- Beat his ass.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.195
[smack]
- Oh, he's slapping him around.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.764
- Darius, we're going
to get in trouble.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.499
- All these people watching.
Nobody helps.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.133
- How long do they go on?
- To the fall.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.835
- You're not getting
that camera back, uh-uh.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.904
- Aw, she likes you Darius.
- They dancing.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.639
- Just give it back.

06:45.673 --> 06:49.543
- Get off me, you freak.
[gasping]

06:49.577 --> 06:51.211
- Do we have any idea
who posted these?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.914
- Well, according to Facebook,
it's two sophomores

06:53.947 --> 06:56.784
and one junior
from Shirley Chisholm.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.052
- That's it, guys,
let's go, full court.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.126
- I didn't do nothing.
I just took a video.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.595
- You watched a person
get assaulted

07:07.628 --> 07:08.962
and thrown over a bridge.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.698
- I didn't touch
that freak show,

07:10.731 --> 07:13.200
and why is he wearing a skirt,
acting all--whatever.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.968
- Who were the guys
messing with Avery?

07:15.002 --> 07:16.837
- I don't know.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.640
That's your job.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.975
- Yo, they slapping him around.
- This is deeply disturbing.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.578
- Yes, it is,
and three different students

07:24.612 --> 07:27.247
from your school
posted those videos.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.049
- Well, let me be clear.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.786
This behavior is in no way
indicative of our community.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.121
We strive for inclusion.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.824
- We understand.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.759
Who are these kids?

07:40.761 --> 07:45.065
[indistinct chatter]

07:45.098 --> 07:46.500
- All right, quiet.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.571
Keon Williams
and Markus Green, come with me.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.006
- Why?
- We didn't do nothing.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.542
- Now.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.712
- Why are you looking
for Darius?

07:58.746 --> 08:01.849
- It's a police matter.
Where is he?

08:01.882 --> 08:03.984
- He was here
before school began,

08:04.017 --> 08:05.753
very upset about something.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.721
I told him
we could talk after lunch.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.623
- He live nearby?
- He won't be there.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.125
He hates the projects.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.595
There is one place
he likes to go.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.872
- Darius McCrae?

08:24.905 --> 08:26.674
- Hey, NYPD.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.276
Darius, get up.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.311
- Come on.
I didn't do anything.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.047
- Come on, Darius, stand up.
Let's make this easy.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.186
- Yes, sir.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.673
- So you're saying
it wasn't your fault?

08:59.707 --> 09:01.942
- That tranny started it,
all up in our face with,

09:01.975 --> 09:04.244
you know, being weird.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.947
- That boy goes around
dressed like a girl?

09:06.980 --> 09:10.117
You should be talking
to his parents, not my son.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.185
- Well, they're in the hospital,

09:12.219 --> 09:15.856
and you're here,
so think about that.

09:17.324 --> 09:21.361
- Markus, did you beat up
on a girl?

09:21.394 --> 09:23.063
- He's not a girl, Grandma.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.165
He's one of them he-shes.
- Wow.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.835
- Acts like one, wears makeup.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.136
- Why would anyone do that?

09:29.169 --> 09:31.204
- That's not the issue.

09:31.238 --> 09:35.843
The issue is your grandson
pushed a kid off a bridge.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.277
- You did what?

09:37.310 --> 09:38.779
- I didn't push him
off a bridge, Grandma.

09:38.812 --> 09:39.980
I swear.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.015
- Then you better tell them
who did.

09:45.118 --> 09:48.321
- I don't know.
- Markus, look at me.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.792
I know that your grandmother
did not raise you to lie.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.831
- It was Darius.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.767
He's a grade above me.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.175
- Have a seat.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.914
- Am I going to jail?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.215
- When your mom gets here
we need to talk,

10:15.248 --> 10:16.750
but the best thing
to do is tell the truth.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.085
- You want a soda,
a sandwich or something?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.420
- My stomach's not feeling good.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.423
- Darius?
- This way, ma'am.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.093
I'm Sergeant Benson.
- Ms. McCrae.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.029
I'm Detective Tutuola.
This is Detective Rollins.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.330
- I'm sorry, Mom.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.833
I didn't mean
to do anything bad.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.702
- What do they think you did?

10:34.735 --> 10:37.070
- A teenager was assaulted
in Fort Tryon Park

10:37.104 --> 10:39.807
and is now in the hospital.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.843
- I didn't mean to hurt him.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.111
- Darius is a good kid.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.879
He takes care
of his little sister.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.881
He goes to--to church.

10:47.915 --> 10:50.851
- Okay, well, ma'am, we still
just need to talk to him, okay.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.152
- But he's only 15.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.887
- Which is
why we waited for you.

11:03.030 --> 11:03.163
.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.700
- We were just talking to him.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.736
I asked what was
up with the dress.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.771
- So Markus and Keon
were telling the truth?

11:10.804 --> 11:12.439
It was your idea?

11:12.472 --> 11:16.944
- Yes, but we were all
messing with him,

11:16.977 --> 11:19.446
tried to lift up the skirt.

11:19.479 --> 11:23.083
- Darius, why would
you do that?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.985
- I didn't want my friends
to think I was gay.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.253
- So you were being tough
around your boys.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.955
Is that why you pushed Avery?

11:27.988 --> 11:31.358
- No, he fell on me,
and I just pushed him away.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.393
I didn't mean for him
to go over the bridge.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.462
- Then why'd you run?

11:35.495 --> 11:38.465
- Because it was
the worst thing I ever did.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.869
I thought I killed someone.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.904
- This kid
seems genuinely upset.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.873
The other two,
they just think it's funny.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.841
- Yeah, well, the other two
didn't push Avery off a bridge.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.242
I mean, she could have died.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.811
- Bright side,
all three confessed.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.079
We got the video evidence.
We're done.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.914
- Look, the video is shaky.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.182
The kids are underaged.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.449
I just don't want anyone
claiming

11:56.483 --> 11:59.853
that those confessions
were coerced.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.790
Let's see if Avery
can come in and make an ID.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.124
- You got it.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.732
[sighs]

12:19.206 --> 12:23.310
- Number four.

12:23.343 --> 12:27.948
Number one.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.216
Three.

12:29.249 --> 12:33.186
- You did great, Avery.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.456
- They look smaller in there,
scared.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.291
- Well, they should be,
Avery.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.927
They're in trouble.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.062
- Did they say why they
did this to me?

12:42.095 --> 12:44.464
I'm not stupid.
I wasn't being cheeky.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.066
- It wasn't anything you did.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.200
We need to get back
to the hospital.

12:47.234 --> 12:50.938
- Excuse me...

12:50.971 --> 12:52.572
Are you the Parkers?
I'm Darius' mother.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.908
- Mrs. McCrae,
now may not be the best time.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.977
- Hold on.
I want to hear her out.

12:59.346 --> 13:03.050
- My son is really sorry
for hurting you.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.818
- Did he tell you
why he did this to me?

13:04.852 --> 13:07.921
- Avery, let's go.
- Just wait a minute.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.356
Ask him, please.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.158
- Okay, we need to leave, now.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.126
- Come on, this way, folks.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.500
- Wait, my son has to
spend the night here?

13:20.533 --> 13:22.335
- No, he's gonna
be able to go home.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.471
The desk sergeant's gonna

13:24.504 --> 13:28.208
give you a appearance ticket
for tomorrow in family court.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.476
- I have to work tomorrow.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.111
I'm a home care attendant.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.080
- Well, you're gonna
have to call in sick.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.314
You got to be there.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.815
- [exhales]

13:41.021 --> 13:42.956
- Those poor parents, right?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.157
- Yeah.

13:44.191 --> 13:48.161
You want one?
- Yeah, please.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.863
Hey, Rollins...

13:49.897 --> 13:52.099
let me ask you something.

13:52.132 --> 13:55.235
What makes a boy
decide to be a girl?

13:55.268 --> 13:57.537
I mean,
is it that he likes boys?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.039
He just doesn't
want to be gay?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.974
- Um...

14:02.375 --> 14:03.944
There's a difference

14:03.977 --> 14:06.546
between gender identity
and sexuality, Carisi.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.149
- Yeah, yeah.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.018
You know, my parents,

14:11.051 --> 14:13.053
they think this is
all about getting attention.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.922
- Uh-huh.

14:14.955 --> 14:18.525
You were a 14-year-old boy once.
[laughs]

14:18.558 --> 14:22.529
And would you or
any other boy you knew

14:22.562 --> 14:24.531
put on a skirt

14:24.564 --> 14:27.034
if it didn't come
from a really real place?

14:27.067 --> 14:31.871
- [scoffs]
No, not a chance.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.545
- Good afternoon.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.280
Which one of you
is Marcus Green?

14:43.083 --> 14:45.285
Come with me, please.
- Counselor, you want us inside?

14:45.318 --> 14:46.653
- If I need anything,
I'll let you know.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.232
Keon Williams?

15:02.502 --> 15:05.205
- Excuse me, I'm missing work.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.941
- I'll let you know
when it's your turn, okay?

15:07.975 --> 15:09.509
Keon?

15:18.986 --> 15:20.553
- It won't be long.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.030
- Thank you so much, Ms. Cox.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.332
I promise you.
Keon has learned his lesson.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.746
- The other boys got probation?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.681
- That will be
my recommendation.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.084
It's their first offense,
and they were both very clear

15:51.118 --> 15:53.353
that Darius was the one
who started this.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.022
- They were going at him, too.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.124
- But you were the one
who pushed Avery off the bridge.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.227
- I didn't mean to.
I just bugged out.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.461
He was touching me.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.630
- You "bugged out."

16:03.663 --> 16:07.567
Did it have anything to do
with Avery wearing a skirt?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.636
- I'm sorry,
my boy's not prejudiced.

16:09.669 --> 16:13.373
- I was just afraid.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.342
- How do you think Avery felt?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.580
- This is not fair.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.249
The other boys get probation,

16:22.282 --> 16:25.452
but she wants my Darius
to do three months in juvie?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.020
- That's what she wants.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.755
A judge still has to rule.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.158
- She also told me
that if it goes to trial,

16:31.191 --> 16:33.193
Darius could get a year.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.661
I said I wanted
to talk to a lawyer,

16:34.694 --> 16:37.297
but she said no one
was available today.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.299
- Well, that's your right.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.668
They're gonna have to wait.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.571
- Talk to that lady
about Darius.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.374
Let her know he's--
he's no thug,

16:47.407 --> 16:49.076
and he's had a lot to deal with.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.410
- I'll do what I can.

16:53.613 --> 16:57.184
- Darius, we have to pick up
your sister.

16:57.217 --> 17:03.190
- Detective Tutuola, can you
make sure Avery gets this?

17:03.223 --> 17:04.457
I need him to know I'm sorry.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.231
- What's that, drawings?
- It's an apology.

17:11.264 --> 17:14.234
- Well, and it's
an admission of guilt.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.069
You know, if you were Avery,
would you want to hear anything

17:16.103 --> 17:17.637
that Darius has
to say right now?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.772
- My son got the crap
kicked out of him

17:19.806 --> 17:22.642
when he was a boy
just for being gay.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.178
No one ever apologized to him.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.651
- Darius McCrae
wrote something for me?

17:31.684 --> 17:33.753
- He did.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.389
He wanted to apologize.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.658
- You don't have to read it
if you don't want to.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.294
- No, I do.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.565
[inhales]

17:51.804 --> 17:56.276
"If I could get a do-over,
I wouldn't do it."

18:15.462 --> 18:17.797
Did you tell him
I was into graphic novels?

18:17.830 --> 18:20.633
- No, we didn't know.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.408
- The boys took a plea.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.477
Does that mean Avery
won't have to testify?

18:30.510 --> 18:33.380
- The third boy, Darius,
is speaking with a lawyer,

18:33.413 --> 18:35.182
so we should know more tomorrow.

18:35.215 --> 18:39.752
- What Avery's gone through,
she's a tough kid.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.521
You must be proud.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.890
- Yeah, we are.

18:43.923 --> 18:47.126
- Code blue.
Code blue.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.201
- That's Avery's room.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.539
- Clear.
- Let's go.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.807
- My baby!

19:00.840 --> 19:02.209
- Please,
you have to wait outside.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.276
- No!
- No.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.477
- Avery?
- No, come on.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.845
- Check the heart...
- No pulse.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.714
- Let's--go on,
just give them some room.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.383
- Let's go again.
- Nothing.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.651
- Come on, Avery.
Stay with me, honey.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.520
Stay with me.
Clear!

19:13.553 --> 19:15.154
- [sobs]

19:19.826 --> 19:22.795
- One minute Avery's fine and
then she's gone just like that?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.531
- What happened?
- A fatty embolism.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.933
- Oh, no.
From the fractured leg, right?

19:26.966 --> 19:28.768
- Yes.

19:28.801 --> 19:32.272
When the femur fractured,
fatty globules were released.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.706
They traveled to the lungs.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.542
Death is almost instantaneous.

19:35.575 --> 19:39.812
- So this embolism was
a direct result of Avery's fall?

19:39.846 --> 19:42.249
- No question.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.817
- [sighs]
- Excuse me.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.653
- [sighs]
Oh, God.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.788
What do we say to them?
I'm sorry?

19:48.821 --> 19:50.557
- Never gets easier.

19:55.828 --> 19:59.699
Mr. and Mrs. Parker...

19:59.732 --> 20:02.235
I'm so sorry.

20:02.269 --> 20:05.305
- Thank you.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.474
[sobbing]

20:15.448 --> 20:16.849
- The M.E. confirm
cause of death?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.585
- Saddle embolism
to the lungs,

20:18.618 --> 20:20.953
direct result of
the broken femur from the fall.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.522
No intervening cause.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.557
- What does that mean
for these boys?

20:24.591 --> 20:26.426
- Well, Markus and Keon
didn't push her.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.261
They didn't cause the death.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.297
- But Darius McCrae did.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.664
- Sergeant Benson,

20:31.698 --> 20:33.766
we need to talk
about the Avery Parker murder.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.402
- Of course.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.270
Kenneth O'Dwyer, meet Pippa Cox.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.671
- It's nice to see you again,
Ms. Cox.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.940
You'll want to be
in on this meeting, too.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.610
The D.A.'s office
is taking over the prosecution.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.281
- Hold up.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.949
Now, you know Darius McCrae's
only 15 years old?

20:49.982 --> 20:52.385
- Yes, and if he's tried
in family court,

20:52.419 --> 20:53.953
he'll be charged
with juvenile delinquency

20:53.986 --> 20:56.289
and be back out on
the street again when he's 18.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.425
- You're looking
to charge him as an adult?

20:58.458 --> 20:59.726
- Second-degree manslaughter.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.728
- We can charge that
in family court.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.397
- We can, but we won't, and I
want to attach a hate crime.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.535
- Okay, wow.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.538
- There's an epidemic
of attacks on trans persons.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.972
We have to take a stand.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.342
- Yes, but I don't think
that this is that case.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.577
Darius seems like a good kid.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.380
- He went after Avery,
he taunted her,

21:20.413 --> 21:21.814
and he pushed her off a bridge.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.617
- But you want to charge
a 15-year-old as an adult?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.553
He could get 20 years.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.054
- It's more like seven,

21:28.087 --> 21:30.590
and while I appreciate
your sympathy for Darius McCrae,

21:30.623 --> 21:34.494
we can't wait for
a more overtly evil perp.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.564
We have to draw a line.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.970
- Darius and I, we feel
horrible that Avery died,

21:44.003 --> 21:46.339
but that was
because of something

21:46.373 --> 21:47.607
that went wrong at the hospital.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.442
- Well, the autopsy shows

21:49.476 --> 21:52.412
that it was a complication
resulting from the fall.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.381
- So what does--
what does that mean?

21:54.414 --> 21:56.082
- They're charging him
with manslaughter.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.017
He'll be tried as an adult.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.759
- My Darius?

22:06.793 --> 22:08.895
Mm,
Mm-mm-mm.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.930
Mm-mm.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.566
He's--he's just a kid.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.569
- But the DA and the mayor
want to send a message

22:16.603 --> 22:19.972
that hate crimes aren't
acceptable in New York City.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.575
- Hate crimes?

22:22.609 --> 22:25.812
The only person Darius
hates right now is himself.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.048
- I'm sorry.
This is where we are.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.619
- You said Darius
was in his room?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.626
- No, you got
to take him right now?

22:39.659 --> 22:41.794
- Yeah,
he's got to be arraigned.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.030
Can you call him, please?

22:46.466 --> 22:48.501
- [sobs]

22:57.744 --> 22:59.579
Darius?

23:00.780 --> 23:03.049
Darius, can you
come here, please?

23:07.186 --> 23:08.988
- Detective Tutuola?

23:09.021 --> 23:11.591
- You have to come with us.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.726
- Darius.
[cries]

23:34.614 --> 23:37.650
[sobs]

23:47.026 --> 23:48.861
- It's been wonderful
to hear so many people

23:48.895 --> 23:52.732
talk about Avery's life today.

23:52.765 --> 23:56.836
You don't know me, but I feel
like I know all of you.

23:56.869 --> 23:59.238
I was Avery's therapist,

23:59.271 --> 24:03.710
and she told me about the people
who were important to her,

24:03.743 --> 24:07.514
like Melody and Rain,

24:07.547 --> 24:12.218
who embraced her the first day
Avery wore a dress to school.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.687
Avery was inspired
by the compassion

24:14.721 --> 24:20.593
of her classmates, her teachers,
and even the police.

24:20.627 --> 24:24.030
This is Avery's legacy;

24:24.063 --> 24:28.568
tolerance, love,

24:28.601 --> 24:31.638
forgiveness.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.108
- Thank you.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.878
Thank you for coming.
- Beautiful, beautiful ceremony.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.246
- Avery was loved.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.749
- I can see that.

24:42.782 --> 24:46.919
- We heard that Darius McCrae
is gonna be charged as an adult.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.021
- I wish the DA
had come to the service.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.923
Everything Avery believed
was about forgiveness.

24:50.957 --> 24:53.059
- Well, the DA wants
to make sure

24:53.092 --> 24:57.229
that what happened to Avery
never happens again.

24:57.263 --> 25:00.867
- How?
By locking up a 15-year-old?

25:00.900 --> 25:02.835
Tell the DA
that's not what we want.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.170
- Lisa, please.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.072
- It's not what
Avery would want.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.209
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.954
- Look, we feel
the same way.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.623
All right, I'll call you back.
That was Barba.

25:23.656 --> 25:24.991
He argued that the case
should stay in family court,

25:25.024 --> 25:26.693
and that's
when O'Dwyer stepped in.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.761
- O'Dwyer's no dummy.
The new DA says jump,

25:28.795 --> 25:30.630
he laces up his sneakers.
- Counselor.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.699
- Well, at least you're not
bad-mouthing me behind my back.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.266
- Look, I'm sorry, Counselor.
It's just, you know,

25:34.300 --> 25:36.636
Avery's mom wants this
in family court.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.237
- I know. I got your messages.
I spoke to her.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.272
- You just ignored her wishes?

25:40.306 --> 25:42.041
- She's suffered
a terrible loss.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.310
I told her that she could speak
at the sentencing hearing.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.145
- Sentencing hearing?

25:46.178 --> 25:47.980
Darius's lawyer
is pleading guilty?

25:48.014 --> 25:50.082
- Not exactly.
He's asked for a bench trial.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.751
- Bench trial?

25:51.784 --> 25:54.053
So he's using
the Clarence Darrow strategy.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.756
Juries are more emotional than
judges, so if you give a judge

25:56.789 --> 25:58.324
absolute power
to declare someone guilty--

25:58.357 --> 26:01.227
- They're less likely
to impose a harsh sentence.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.162
- Yeah.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.737
- It was Darius's idea.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.004
- Yo, what's up with the skirt?

26:12.038 --> 26:13.740
- He saw Avery on that bridge.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.307
- He asked you a question.

26:15.341 --> 26:18.645
- He said we should see
what's under that skirt.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.283
- Get away from me.
- Let's see, tranny.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.284
- What's under there?

26:25.317 --> 26:29.055
- Darius called Avery a tranny?

26:29.088 --> 26:33.192
- Yeah, then he
grabbed at his skirt.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.161
- And what was happening here?

26:35.194 --> 26:37.063
- I tossed the camera to Darius.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.998
He played keep-away.

26:39.031 --> 26:42.001
When Avery reached for it,
he fell on Darius.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.302
- It's not funny.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.772
- And Darius, like, wigged out.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.274
He just pushed him
off that bridge.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.176
- What happened next?

26:50.209 --> 26:51.744
- I took Avery's
initial statement.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.380
She had a concussion
and a broken femur.

26:54.413 --> 26:57.283
- How did Avery
describe the attack?

26:57.316 --> 27:00.352
- Avery felt targeted, bullied.

27:00.386 --> 27:05.291
She was upset about the slurs
used: tranny, slut, he-she.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.159
Later, after she ID'd Darius,

27:07.193 --> 27:10.062
she made it very clear to me
that she was not "being cheeky."

27:10.096 --> 27:12.231
She'd done nothing
to provoke them.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.266
- Avery died two days later.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.269
The M.E. has already testified
that her death was

27:17.303 --> 27:19.405
a result of that assault.
Do you agree?

27:19.438 --> 27:22.374
- Yes, there were
no intervening factors.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.144
The saddle embolism that killed
Avery was a direct result

27:25.177 --> 27:28.014
of the broken femur
caused by the fall.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.683
- Thank you, Doctor.

27:30.717 --> 27:33.986
- Ms. Davis, you have been
Darius's English teacher

27:34.020 --> 27:37.323
and advisor
for the past two years.

27:37.356 --> 27:40.827
Has he ever had a problem
with LGBTQ students?

27:40.860 --> 27:43.362
- No. Darius has
a little sister,

27:43.395 --> 27:45.464
which may be why he was
protective of younger students

27:45.497 --> 27:47.166
being bullied,

27:47.199 --> 27:50.870
including one instance,
a student I believe to be gay.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.840
- And he himself has been
affected by violence?

27:53.873 --> 27:58.778
- Yes, last Christmas Darius
saw his older cousin get shot.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.448
It made an impact.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.016
His behavior changed.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.885
He began to study,
really apply himself.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.954
He didn't want
to become a statistic.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.956
He wanted to graduate,
become a graphic artist.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.891
He's quite talented.

28:11.924 --> 28:14.794
- And the day after
his encounter with Avery,

28:16.395 --> 28:19.165
how did he behave?
- He was distraught.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.801
We were going to talk,
but then the police came.

28:23.903 --> 28:27.173
I know the video
looks bad, Your Honor,

28:27.206 --> 28:29.175
but Darius is not a bad kid.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.779
He has a good heart,
and I know it's no excuse,

28:32.812 --> 28:35.314
but he's never been
exposed to transgender people,

28:35.347 --> 28:39.351
and I think
he just got...confused.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.321
- Thank you, Ms. Davis.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.390
Nothing further.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.192
- Mr. O'Dwyer?

28:46.225 --> 28:47.493
- No questions.

28:50.997 --> 28:53.032
- How are you two holding up?

28:53.065 --> 28:55.267
- We need to be here
for Avery.

28:55.301 --> 28:58.037
We also feel Darius
should be found guilty.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.239
- I'm just worried about what'll
happen to him when he is.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.141
- Judge Barth
keeps an open mind, so.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.045
- Olivia?

29:06.078 --> 29:07.980
- Dr. Lindstrom.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.381
- Let me walk you guys in,
all right?

29:09.415 --> 29:10.850
- Thank you, great.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.854
- The victim's parents.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.923
- They may not like
my testimony.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.791
- Well, despite their loss

29:18.825 --> 29:23.129
they've managed to find
some compassion for Darius.

29:23.162 --> 29:26.165
- Grace is usually
a better choice than bitterness.

29:32.004 --> 29:37.076
Darius McCrae is 15 years old,
and, like most male teenagers,

29:37.109 --> 29:40.479
his impulse control
is not quite evolved.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.214
The amygdala,
that part of the brain

29:42.248 --> 29:45.184
which is responsible
for impulsive behavior,

29:45.217 --> 29:46.385
is very active.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.920
- More so than reasoning
and judgment?

29:47.954 --> 29:49.221
- Yes.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.190
That is controlled
by the frontal lobe,

29:51.223 --> 29:54.593
which is still developing well
into an average person's 20s.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.362
- What, in your medical opinion,

29:56.395 --> 29:59.498
happened to Darius when he
encountered Avery Parker?

29:59.531 --> 30:02.835
- Avery was someone
very different

30:02.869 --> 30:07.506
from the biological boys
Darius knows,

30:07.539 --> 30:10.209
someone "other" in ways
that were threatening to a boy

30:10.242 --> 30:13.445
just beginning to mature
sexually and emotionally.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.582
- Do you think that Darius

30:16.615 --> 30:19.451
could have been motivated
by hate that afternoon?

30:19.485 --> 30:21.187
- No, I think it had
much more to do

30:21.220 --> 30:23.455
with Darius' own insecurity.

30:23.489 --> 30:27.459
He was flooded with fear
and the need to show his peers

30:27.493 --> 30:29.461
that he was a straight--

30:29.495 --> 30:31.931
a "real"--man.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.599
In conversations with Darius,
it became clear

30:33.632 --> 30:37.136
that he had very little exposure
to transgender individuals,

30:37.169 --> 30:40.539
certainly not enough to develop
either tolerance or hatred.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.241
- Thank you, Doctor.
Nothing further.

30:46.245 --> 30:47.646
- You testify that Mr. McCrae

30:47.679 --> 30:50.282
had little exposure
to transgender persons,

30:50.316 --> 30:54.320
that he was flooded with fear
when he saw Avery,

30:54.353 --> 30:56.355
yet he deliberately
approached her.

30:56.388 --> 30:59.391
He called her a tranny, a slut.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.461
He even said, "Let's see
what's under that skirt."

31:02.494 --> 31:05.231
- He was posturing
for his friends, yes.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.066
- Was he?

31:07.099 --> 31:11.603
When he taunted Avery,
when he harassed her,

31:11.637 --> 31:13.305
when he killed her,

31:13.339 --> 31:16.275
that was nothing
but poor judgment,

31:16.308 --> 31:19.245
lack of impulse control
typical of all teenagers?

31:19.278 --> 31:22.248
- Many teenagers
when compared to adults, yes.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.417
That's why most violent crime
is committed by youths

31:25.451 --> 31:26.986
under the age of 25,

31:27.019 --> 31:28.420
and it's certainly
why a 15-year-old

31:28.454 --> 31:30.256
should not be tried as an adult.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.925
- So, what, give him a mulligan?

31:32.959 --> 31:34.160
Boys will be boys?

31:34.193 --> 31:36.495
Are you saying
that when Mr. McCrae

31:36.528 --> 31:39.231
singled out a member
of a protected class,

31:39.265 --> 31:42.401
taunting Avery
because of her gender identity,

31:42.434 --> 31:44.170
he wasn't discriminating?

31:44.203 --> 31:46.005
- I don't believe so, no.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.640
- Then why didn't he push
someone else off the bridge?

31:48.674 --> 31:53.045
- As I said, his insecurity
caused him to react impulsively.

31:53.079 --> 31:56.415
- The same could be said of
gay-bashing, skinhead violence,

31:56.448 --> 31:58.350
and even lynchings.
- Objection, Your Honor.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.086
- Sustained, I'll disregard.

32:00.119 --> 32:03.255
Have you an actual question,
Mr. O'Dwyer?

32:03.289 --> 32:05.124
- I guess my question is
isn't that why

32:05.157 --> 32:08.127
we have hate crime laws
in this state?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.495
- Those laws
should be for adults.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.497
This case is exactly
when we should remember

32:11.530 --> 32:15.067
that the mind of
a child is still forming,

32:15.101 --> 32:16.969
and it is very different
than the mind of an adult.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.337
- Well, I think we need
to remember

32:18.370 --> 32:19.638
that there are hundreds

32:19.671 --> 32:22.074
of thousands of children
in New York City,

32:22.108 --> 32:27.079
yet only Darius McCrae pushed
another child off a bridge

32:27.113 --> 32:30.716
because, as you said,
Avery was "other."

32:35.421 --> 32:38.390
- When I saw Avery
fall off the bridge,

32:38.424 --> 32:40.659
I felt sick to my stomach.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.095
I feel sick all the time now.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.430
- Why is that?

32:46.165 --> 32:49.501
- 'Cause I know
how it feels to lose someone

32:49.535 --> 32:51.137
you love, like your--

32:51.170 --> 32:53.639
like your guts
are being ripped out,

32:53.672 --> 32:59.045
and that's what
I did to Avery's parents.

32:59.078 --> 33:04.116
I didn't want him--
her to die.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.618
I didn't hate Avery.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.688
I can never forgive myself.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.627
- Thank you, Darius.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.196
- Mr. O'Dwyer?

33:19.531 --> 33:22.268
- You say that you did not mean
to push Avery off the bridge.

33:22.301 --> 33:25.271
Why were you on the bridge
in the first place?

33:25.304 --> 33:27.139
- I just wanted
to talk to Avery.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.575
- Talk or tease?

33:33.745 --> 33:36.582
- A little bit of both, I guess.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.317
- And that was a choice
that you made?

33:41.387 --> 33:43.189
- Yes, sir.

33:43.222 --> 33:45.791
- When you approached Avery,
did she ask to be left alone?

33:50.096 --> 33:51.330
- Yes, sir.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.699
- And yet you
grabbed at her skirt.

33:53.732 --> 33:56.668
Was that a choice?
- Yes, sir.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.438
- And when you wouldn't give
Avery her camera back,

33:59.471 --> 34:02.241
was that a choice?
- Yes, sir.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.709
- But pushing her
was not a choice?

34:03.742 --> 34:08.180
- No, he just fell on me,
and I just reacted.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.650
- Why did Avery fall?

34:11.683 --> 34:13.852
Is it because you made
the choice to go after her,

34:13.885 --> 34:17.089
to tease her, to taunt her?

34:17.123 --> 34:19.158
Why would you do that?

34:27.466 --> 34:30.102
- I don't know.

34:30.136 --> 34:33.172
[whispering]
I don't even know, sir.

34:38.510 --> 34:42.148
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

34:47.553 --> 34:51.590
- We all are, Mr. McCrae.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.858
Nothing further.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.237
- I understand you have
one last witness, Mr. Varma?

35:05.271 --> 35:07.239
- Yes, Your Honor,
Mr. Eric Parker.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.208
- With all due respect
to Mr. Parker, his testimony

35:09.241 --> 35:11.677
is clearly more appropriate
for a victim impact statement.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.779
- Your Honor, he only
approached me yesterday,

35:13.812 --> 35:16.148
and I do believe
that Mr. Parker's testimony

35:16.182 --> 35:20.786
will influence your decision as
to the hate crime charge itself.

35:20.819 --> 35:24.523
- All right, I'll allow it.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.558
- Will you explain to the court
what that is, Mr. Parker?

35:28.260 --> 35:32.898
- An apology drawing
from Darius to Avery.

35:34.400 --> 35:38.437
Avery saw this shortly
before she died.

35:40.672 --> 35:41.907
It meant a lot.

35:44.443 --> 35:49.615
I know Avery felt forgiveness
toward Darius.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.818
- Defense Exhibit D, Your Honor.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.822
- [exhales]

36:08.467 --> 36:10.602
Mr. Parker,

36:10.636 --> 36:15.474
you wish to testify on behalf
of the defendant,

36:15.507 --> 36:17.509
the boy who has caused
your family so much pain?

36:19.345 --> 36:21.913
- Yes.

36:21.947 --> 36:25.351
My wife and I want to make sure
that Avery's death

36:25.384 --> 36:27.386
means something,

36:27.419 --> 36:30.456
that no transgender child
should ever again

36:30.489 --> 36:34.226
be singled out or hurt,

36:34.260 --> 36:38.930
but we also want
to make sure that the tragedy

36:38.964 --> 36:42.901
is not compounded by the tragedy

36:42.934 --> 36:46.738
of taking another child
away from his family.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.944
- Thank you for your compassion.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.753
- Do I think Darius McCrae
left home that morning

37:01.787 --> 37:03.922
with the intent
to kill Avery Parker?

37:03.955 --> 37:07.393
No, but intent
can be formed in an instant,

37:07.426 --> 37:12.464
and in that instant Mr. McCrae
saw Avery as "other,"

37:12.498 --> 37:16.368
someone he could taunt,
tease,

37:16.402 --> 37:18.737
someone
he could push off a bridge.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.607
- Darius knows that
what he did was wrong.

37:21.640 --> 37:25.677
That's evidenced by his remorse
and the apology letter he drew.

37:25.711 --> 37:29.281
Now, what happened
on that bridge was tragic,

37:29.315 --> 37:32.751
but sending a 15-year-old boy
to prison

37:32.784 --> 37:36.388
for an instant's loss of control
will not bring Avery back.

37:36.422 --> 37:39.425
- We have heard
that Mr. McCrae is a good kid,

37:39.458 --> 37:43.061
that his actions
were not motivated by hatred,

37:43.094 --> 37:48.066
but one purpose of punishment
is deterrence, to send a message

37:48.099 --> 37:52.904
that there are some actions
not acceptable to society.

37:52.938 --> 37:56.942
- Avery's parents have asked
this court for mercy.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.677
They believe the message

37:58.710 --> 38:02.348
that Avery would want to send
is one of compassion.

38:02.381 --> 38:07.553
Is sending a 15-year-old boy
to an adult prison

38:07.586 --> 38:10.556
really what's best for society?

38:10.589 --> 38:14.360
Are we living in the Dark Ages,
an eye for an eye?

38:14.393 --> 38:16.428
This is two lives lost.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.697
- Transgender teens
have a tough road.

38:18.730 --> 38:22.868
They're ostracized,
bullied, driven to suicide.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.970
I don't normally
go against the wishes

38:25.003 --> 38:28.374
of a victim's parents,

38:28.407 --> 38:31.343
but I never want to see
another child die

38:31.377 --> 38:33.645
simply for being who they are.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.984
- Thank you, Counselors.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.752
I appreciate all
of your arguments.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.087
We'll take a short recess.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.725
- [sighs]

38:52.898 --> 38:55.967
I thought it was real nice
of Mr. Parker

38:56.001 --> 38:58.504
to say the things that he said.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.472
- Mm-hmm.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.017
- It's gonna be okay, isn't it?

39:12.050 --> 39:14.953
- I hope so, Ms. McCrae.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.726
- The judge is coming back in.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.831
- Okay.

39:30.902 --> 39:34.005
- Are we all settled?

39:34.039 --> 39:36.107
Will the defendant please rise?

39:41.713 --> 39:46.485
I was moved by what witnesses
said about your character

39:46.518 --> 39:49.888
and capacity, Mr. McCrae.

39:49.921 --> 39:53.725
I was particularly moved
by Mr. Parker's testimony.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.997
However...

39:59.030 --> 40:02.834
it is unrealistic
to believe that violence

40:02.868 --> 40:05.003
against protected classes

40:05.036 --> 40:08.106
can be extinguished
without appropriate punishment

40:08.139 --> 40:11.910
under the law.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.113
Darius McCrae, I find you
guilty of manslaughter

40:15.146 --> 40:19.017
in the second degree with
the hate crime statute attached.

40:19.050 --> 40:22.454
- No, that's my baby!

40:22.488 --> 40:24.456
- Order, order.

Darius McCrae,

40:29.661 --> 40:33.064
you are hereby remanded

40:33.098 --> 40:36.201

at which time you will

40:36.234 --> 40:38.136
be transferred to Green
Haven Correctional Facility

40:38.169 --> 40:40.438
to serve out the remainder
