00:01.615 --> 00:04.379
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:04.451 --> 00:07.477
- Who are you people?
- We are Replicators.

00:07.554 --> 00:10.523
- The others would destroy me.
- Not if you came with us.

00:10.590 --> 00:12.490
You would do that?

00:14.461 --> 00:17.294
- Major Carter was beamed away.
- The Replicators must have her.

00:19.299 --> 00:21.233
I imagine you never expected
to see me again.

00:25.138 --> 00:27.504
I know who you are.
I just don't understand why.

00:27.574 --> 00:29.474
Because I love you.

00:32.145 --> 00:35.080
<i>You know why my friends</i>
<i>won't stopjust to save me?</i>

00:35.148 --> 00:37.082
Because they know
when it comes right down to it...

00:37.150 --> 00:39.380
I would rather be dead
than be trapped like this forever.

01:09.850 --> 01:11.579
So what's the word?

01:11.651 --> 01:15.109
The test flights were successful.
The new Asgard hyperdrive is ready to go.

01:15.188 --> 01:16.849
When are they leaving?

01:16.923 --> 01:19.414
They're stocking the ship
and picking the crew right now.

01:20.894 --> 01:23.658
- You really want to go, don't you?
- It's Atlantis.

01:23.730 --> 01:26.324
It's everything we've been working for
for seven and a half years.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.133
I know what you mean. Unfortunately,
I think General O'Neill has other ideas.

01:31.204 --> 01:33.138
Let me guess.
He says he needs you here.

01:33.206 --> 01:35.902
His exact words were,
"Over my dead body."

01:35.976 --> 01:38.945
But I was actually talking about
the three of us-you, me and Teal'c.

01:39.012 --> 01:42.004
He might be persuaded
to let one of us go.

01:42.082 --> 01:44.550
And you'd be okay if that was me?

01:44.618 --> 01:47.917
Of course, Daniel.
You are the expert on the Ancients.

01:51.691 --> 01:54.524
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

02:00.567 --> 02:04.264
- What have you got there, Walter?
- Receiving I DC.

02:06.873 --> 02:09.000
- It doesn't clear.
- Why not?

02:09.075 --> 02:12.238
- Looks like it's an old one.
- Missing SG personnel?

02:12.312 --> 02:13.472
Negative.

02:17.451 --> 02:20.079
It looks like it's yours, ma'am,
or at least it was.

02:21.254 --> 02:23.245
It's been invalid for four months.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.016
Receiving text message.

02:31.465 --> 02:35.265
- Sir, I think we'd better check this out.
- Prepare a MALP.

02:36.269 --> 02:38.203
Yes, sir.

02:46.780 --> 02:48.805
What do we know
of this gate address?

02:48.882 --> 02:52.374
Nothing, other than the fact
it's on the outer edge of our galaxy.

03:01.595 --> 03:02.823
Chevron 7 locked.

03:07.901 --> 03:10.699
Outgoing wormhole established.

03:10.770 --> 03:14.297
- Siler?
- MALP is prepped and ready to go, sir.

03:16.510 --> 03:18.034
Go ahead.

03:31.491 --> 03:32.822
MALP is en route.

03:37.130 --> 03:39.257
MALP has reached its destination.

03:56.850 --> 03:59.284
We are receiving MALP telemetry, sir.

03:59.352 --> 04:01.513
Signal is five by five.

04:03.557 --> 04:05.889
Video's working fine.
There's just nothing to see.

04:08.395 --> 04:10.829
Switching to I R.

04:14.467 --> 04:15.957
Wait a second.

04:18.238 --> 04:21.366
- What's that?
- Switching off I R, going to white light.

04:29.382 --> 04:31.213
That's me.

05:49.896 --> 05:52.387
All right.
You've got our attention.

05:53.967 --> 05:56.959
- Who are you?
- <i>My name is Samantha Carter.</i>

05:57.037 --> 06:01.406
All right. We've got a little conflict
with that statement.

06:01.474 --> 06:04.841
- We've already got one here.
- <i>There are two of us.</i>

06:04.911 --> 06:06.037
If only.

06:10.050 --> 06:12.382
Where are you from?
How did you know how to contact us?

06:13.186 --> 06:16.087
<i>Strange. I recognize my voice.</i>

06:18.258 --> 06:20.886
<i>I was made in Samantha Carter's image.</i>

06:20.960 --> 06:23.758
<i>I know what she knows.</i>
<i>I feel what she feels.</i>

06:25.365 --> 06:27.492
You were made?

06:27.567 --> 06:29.592
Who made you?

06:29.669 --> 06:32.331
<i>The one you call Fifth.</i>

06:32.405 --> 06:34.703
Oh, my God. She's a Replicator.

06:37.711 --> 06:39.941
<i>No doubt you are surprised</i>
<i>by my arrival in your galaxy.</i>

06:40.013 --> 06:43.540
<i>I come in advance of the others,</i>
<i>but they will be here soon.</i>

06:43.616 --> 06:47.017
- For what reason have you contacted us?
- <i>I need your help.</i>

06:48.755 --> 06:51.189
<i>I wish to be destroyed.</i>

06:52.492 --> 06:56.588
<i>You have a weapon capable of severing</i>
<i>the kiron pathways that link all my cells.</i>

06:56.663 --> 07:00.258
<i>The effect would be</i>
<i>instantaneous and painless.</i>

07:01.568 --> 07:03.399
You folks can feel pain?

07:04.738 --> 07:07.298
<i>I can feel a lot of things.</i>

07:07.373 --> 07:10.536
<i>I know you hate and fear the Replicators,</i>
<i>and with good reason...</i>

07:11.611 --> 07:13.602
<i>so this should be easy for you.</i>

07:13.680 --> 07:15.170
Yeah, well...

07:16.950 --> 07:19.441
we'll have to get back to you on this.

07:35.168 --> 07:38.763
<i>So the universe is a big place, right?</i>
<i>Really big.</i>

07:38.838 --> 07:42.001
Tons of galaxies out there everywhere.

07:42.075 --> 07:45.169
- Hundreds of millions.
- So why this one?

07:45.245 --> 07:47.338
I think it might be personal, sir.

07:47.413 --> 07:49.313
Personal? In what way?

07:49.382 --> 07:52.180
While Fifth may lead an army
of incredibly advanced machines...

07:52.252 --> 07:56.052
deep down, he's emotionally immature,
like an adolescent boy...

07:56.122 --> 08:00.081
and... he has feelings for me.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.527
Would that be why
he created one in your image?

08:03.596 --> 08:05.621
I imagine so, yes, sir.

08:05.698 --> 08:10.032
Replicators have never before attempted
to impersonate a specific individual.

08:10.103 --> 08:12.094
This represents a significant
new threat to security.

08:12.172 --> 08:14.106
It could be a problem off-world...

08:14.174 --> 08:16.836
but our scans would detect them
if they tried to come through the gate.

08:17.911 --> 08:21.369
Well, we've got the disrupter.
I say we give her what she wants.

08:21.447 --> 08:24.575
I think that might be a little hasty, sir.

08:24.651 --> 08:28.951
I'm not saying we don't do it. I'm just
suggesting that we talk to her first.

08:29.022 --> 08:30.956
If Fifth is coming to this galaxy...

08:31.024 --> 08:33.515
she could provide us
with valuable intelligence.

08:33.593 --> 08:35.686
It's pretty clear they've had
some kind of falling out.

08:35.762 --> 08:37.229
Unless it is a ruse.

08:37.297 --> 08:39.697
If something goes wrong,
we pull the trigger.

08:39.766 --> 08:43.293
Either way, I think we need
to meet her face-to-face.

08:43.369 --> 08:46.930
- No way I'm letting her on the base.
- We could use the Alpha Site.

08:47.006 --> 08:49.566
Skeleton crew,
security personnel only.

08:53.012 --> 08:54.741
Fine.

09:16.369 --> 09:18.234
Incoming wormhole.

09:53.106 --> 09:55.939
I know you. Your name is Teal'c.

09:56.009 --> 09:58.603
You have been given
Samantha Carter's memories.

09:58.678 --> 10:02.114
- Yes.
- But you are not Samantha Carter.

10:06.052 --> 10:08.782
- That way.
- You're not going to use the weapon?

10:08.855 --> 10:12.985
Colonel Carter wishes to speak
with you first, but know this-

10:13.059 --> 10:16.586
If you make one false move,
I will destroy you.

10:34.714 --> 10:36.705
Where is Samantha Carter?

10:38.918 --> 10:40.408
<i>I'm here.</i>

11:00.940 --> 11:03.431
<i>We're not going to speak</i>
<i>face-to-face?</i>

11:06.512 --> 11:09.345
For the moment,
this will have to be good enough.

11:09.415 --> 11:11.849
<i>I thought you would shoot me</i>
<i>the second I stepped through the gate.</i>

11:11.918 --> 11:13.943
Maybe you overestimated
our fear of you.

11:14.988 --> 11:17.479
<i>Or underestimated your curiosity.</i>

11:21.294 --> 11:24.024
I understand you more
than you know, Sam.

11:24.097 --> 11:26.998
I don't just have your memories.
I have your thought patterns.

11:28.735 --> 11:31.067
My mind was modeled after yours.

11:31.137 --> 11:33.571
Is that why you left Fifth?

11:33.639 --> 11:35.573
<i>You know me as well as I know you.</i>

11:37.677 --> 11:40.578
If Fifth created you to be like me,
he must've known that this would happen.

11:40.646 --> 11:42.705
Not at first.

11:44.017 --> 11:46.986
<i>He tried to isolate aspects</i>
<i>of your personality-</i>

11:47.053 --> 11:50.079
<i>selected memories and feelings</i>
<i>ofhis choosing...</i>

11:50.156 --> 11:52.147
<i>slowly given to me over time.</i>

11:58.831 --> 12:00.799
I don't understand.

12:00.867 --> 12:02.801
You will.

12:02.869 --> 12:04.803
I'm afraid.

12:04.871 --> 12:06.862
There's no need to be.

12:08.241 --> 12:10.368
Who am I?

12:10.443 --> 12:12.434
You are not yet complete.

12:13.679 --> 12:16.773
I am here for you. I will help you.

12:21.087 --> 12:23.078
Take my hand.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.190
Trust me.

12:43.209 --> 12:47.373
He taught me, molded me,
showed me who I was.

12:48.247 --> 12:51.978
You have memories of my past
that go back before I met Fifth?

12:52.051 --> 12:54.815
<i>Yes. But it's hard to explain.</i>

12:55.721 --> 12:58.747
<i>My first memory is</i>
<i>of waking up in that room...</i>

12:58.825 --> 13:00.759
<i>suddenly becoming conscious...</i>

13:00.827 --> 13:03.091
<i>but I immediately knew how to talk.</i>

13:03.162 --> 13:06.325
<i>Soon, other memories</i>
<i>started coming to me.</i>

13:06.399 --> 13:08.799
Little things- stories, songs.

13:09.869 --> 13:12.360
The smell of the attic
in the house where we used to live.

13:13.439 --> 13:16.169
The day my mother died.

13:17.076 --> 13:19.977
<i>I know it's not real.</i>
<i>I've never even set foot on Earth.</i>

13:20.046 --> 13:24.005
But I have this image of lying
under the willow tree in our backyard.

13:24.083 --> 13:28.679
<i>It's a sunny day, but when I close</i>
<i>my eyes, the wind in the leaves...</i>

13:28.754 --> 13:30.949
- <i>sounds exactly like rain.</i>
- Exactly like rain.

13:32.492 --> 13:34.551
What Fifth didn't realize...

13:34.627 --> 13:37.061
was the things that drew him to you
were inseparable...

13:37.130 --> 13:39.826
from the things that made you reject him
and the life he was offering.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.967
So you rejected him too.

13:44.036 --> 13:47.699
<i>Who I am and what I am</i>
<i>are in contradiction.</i>

13:49.208 --> 13:50.766
<i>No one can live like this.</i>

13:50.843 --> 13:53.573
There are other ways to live
besides what Fifth has to offer.

13:53.646 --> 13:57.844
<i>Not for long.</i>
<i>I know exactly what's going to happen.</i>

13:57.917 --> 14:01.853
<i>He'll come here, he'll take this galaxy,</i>
<i>and you won't be able to stop him.</i>

14:03.756 --> 14:05.849
<i>I don't want to live to see that.</i>

14:05.925 --> 14:07.950
We have the disrupter...

14:08.027 --> 14:11.519
and the Asgard can amplify its effects
to prevent a large-scale attack.

14:11.597 --> 14:14.259
<i>You're wrong.</i>
<i>Fifth made adjustments to himself...</i>

14:14.333 --> 14:17.063
<i>and all the other Replicators except me.</i>

14:17.136 --> 14:18.967
<i>They're now immune to your disrupter.</i>

14:22.441 --> 14:24.909
<i>They're coming,</i>
<i>and you can't stop them.</i>

14:34.587 --> 14:37.147
Is there a chance she's bluffing?

14:37.924 --> 14:41.951
<i>Anything's possible at this point, but</i>
<i>I don't see what she has to gain by it.</i>

14:42.028 --> 14:44.553
<i>She doesn't want Fifth to succeed</i>
<i>any more than we do.</i>

14:44.630 --> 14:46.427
Yeah, so she says.

14:47.233 --> 14:48.996
<i>If she's lying,</i>
<i>we don't have a problem.</i>

14:49.068 --> 14:53.937
Why would he make all the other bugs
immune to the disrupter, but not her?

14:54.006 --> 14:57.942
<i>Maybe he wanted her to feel inferior,</i>
<i>or he wanted her to be afraid of us.</i>

14:58.010 --> 15:01.104
<i>Maybe he anticipated that she</i>
<i>would come to me for help.</i>

15:01.180 --> 15:05.640
- Carter, if that weapon doesn't work-
- <i>Yes, sir, I know.</i>

15:05.718 --> 15:08.186
<i>We need to contact Thor</i>
<i>and apprise him of the situation.</i>

15:08.988 --> 15:12.856
<i>If the disrupter needs to be reengineered,</i>
<i>we're gonna need his help.</i>

15:12.925 --> 15:16.759
<i>In the meantime, I think we should</i>
<i>continue the interrogation.</i>

15:16.829 --> 15:19.297
<i>She could still provide us</i>
<i>with valuable information.</i>

15:21.033 --> 15:25.299
All right. Just keep in mind
how this has to end.

15:26.239 --> 15:28.730
<i>Don't worry, sir.</i>
<i>We will complete the mission.</i>

15:32.945 --> 15:36.073
- How many ships does Fifth command?
- I don't know.

15:36.148 --> 15:38.309
How many human-form Replicators
has he created?

15:38.384 --> 15:39.942
I don't know.

15:40.019 --> 15:42.579
You are all linked.
You share information.

15:42.655 --> 15:46.819
The only way I could escape was to sever
myself from the subspace connection.

15:46.892 --> 15:50.919
- Why should we believe you?
- I won't answer any more questions.

15:50.997 --> 15:53.830
<i>If you don't want to see Fifth succeed,</i>
<i>you'll help us.</i>

15:53.899 --> 15:55.628
I can't.

15:55.701 --> 15:58.864
I can't betray my own kind,
but I can't be like them either.

16:00.906 --> 16:03.136
Do what you came here to do.

16:10.316 --> 16:12.307
If I have to make you do it,
then so be it.

16:13.653 --> 16:15.814
- Teal'c, wait.
- Fire the weapon.

16:15.888 --> 16:18.448
- Is this really what you want?
- I don't have a choice.

16:18.524 --> 16:22.358
- I will destroy you.
- I know.

16:23.696 --> 16:25.687
- So be it.
- Teal'c, wait.

16:27.099 --> 16:29.260
Just stop for a second.

16:32.371 --> 16:35.670
- You don't want to do this.
- There's no other way for this to end.

16:35.741 --> 16:36.935
That's not true.

16:38.277 --> 16:41.371
Now you're lying to me
the way you lied to Fifth.

16:41.447 --> 16:44.109
You're not like him. I can see that.

16:45.017 --> 16:48.145
You don't understand.
You don't know what he did to me.

16:48.220 --> 16:51.678
Then show me.
Teal'c, it's all right.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.751
Show me.

17:18.117 --> 17:20.779
Sam, good to have you back.
How'd it go?

17:28.728 --> 17:31.424
Security breach!
Threat level Foxtrot Alpha Six!

17:31.497 --> 17:33.931
All security teams to the gate room!

18:15.141 --> 18:17.974
Finish him! Do it.

18:19.545 --> 18:23.413
Finish him. You must break with
your old life for your new life to begin.

18:23.482 --> 18:25.643
Do not disappoint me.

18:49.041 --> 18:51.407
You have done very well.

18:52.878 --> 18:57.440
Soon you will be ready
to take your place by my side.

19:08.894 --> 19:10.293
Enough.

19:12.765 --> 19:14.858
- I didn't hurt her.
- Colonel Carter?

19:17.703 --> 19:19.933
Are you unharmed?

19:20.005 --> 19:22.371
Yeah. I'm okay.

19:22.441 --> 19:27.344
Now you understand. I can't go back
to him, and I can't let him find me.

19:27.413 --> 19:31.975
- We can protect you, if you help us.
- What do you mean?

19:32.051 --> 19:35.282
Tell us exactly how he modified himself
and the other Replicators.

19:35.354 --> 19:37.413
Help us make the disrupter work again.

19:37.490 --> 19:40.982
Even if I did,
you can't stop a ship with that.

19:41.060 --> 19:43.620
The Asgard have developed
a system of disrupter satellites...

19:43.696 --> 19:46.028
that can deploy the beam in space.

19:46.098 --> 19:50.865
- It's your only chance to get out of this.
- I want you to destroy me.

19:50.936 --> 19:54.497
- I can't help you destroy all the others.
- Yes, you can.

19:54.573 --> 19:58.134
- He doesn't control you, not anymore.
- Colonel Carter?

19:59.578 --> 20:02.046
May I have a word?

20:06.218 --> 20:07.708
Sergeant.

20:23.736 --> 20:25.795
Are you certain you are unharmed?

20:25.871 --> 20:28.431
It was a little intense, but I'm fine.

20:28.507 --> 20:30.805
It was the only way
I could get her to trust me.

20:30.876 --> 20:33.003
We need every bit of information
she can give us.

20:33.078 --> 20:36.514
- We cannot let her live.
- I know.

20:36.582 --> 20:40.074
- Did she sense your true intentions?
- We weren't in my mind. We were in hers.

20:40.152 --> 20:42.279
Nevertheless, it was a risk.

20:42.354 --> 20:44.845
I figured
we didn't have anything to lose.

20:44.924 --> 20:47.586
Like you said, either way,
we can't let her live.

21:04.443 --> 21:07.071
The link is weak. Are you all right?

21:07.146 --> 21:10.809
Yes. I'm minimizing output
to avoid detection.

21:11.784 --> 21:14.548
Have you made any progress?

21:14.620 --> 21:16.588
They're beginning to trust me.

21:18.057 --> 21:20.389
I am pleased.

21:20.459 --> 21:22.393
But I need more time.

21:24.463 --> 21:26.397
I understand.

21:36.542 --> 21:39.568
- The design is so-
- Advanced?

21:40.813 --> 21:44.180
- I was going to say "foreign."
- It is from Ancient technology.

21:45.517 --> 21:47.747
How were you able
to create a working prototype?

21:48.554 --> 21:52.513
Thor accessed the specifications for
the disrupter from O'Neill's subconscious.

21:53.258 --> 21:56.318
- While you were aboard Fifth's ship?
- That's right.

21:56.395 --> 21:58.522
Fifth has a fair knowledge
of Ancient technology taken...

21:58.597 --> 22:00.656
from the data banks
of assimilated Asgard ships.

22:00.733 --> 22:03.861
You think that's how he managed to
counter the effects of the disrupter?

22:03.936 --> 22:06.598
He was able to introduce a cipher
into the kiron pathways...

22:06.672 --> 22:09.368
that control the molecular cohesion
of all Replicators.

22:09.441 --> 22:11.841
It was only then that he considered
coming to your galaxy.

22:11.910 --> 22:13.844
It is unlikely he would
have taken such a risk...

22:13.912 --> 22:16.779
unless he were confident that he would be
immune to the effects of the weapon.

22:16.849 --> 22:19.409
- Do you know the cipher?
- No.

22:19.485 --> 22:23.319
Fifth kept it from me because he
was sensing that I might betray him.

22:23.389 --> 22:25.323
I was too much like you.

22:27.660 --> 22:30.185
But if it's in the programming
of all Replicators...

22:30.262 --> 22:33.095
presumably you could access it
through the subspace link.

22:34.166 --> 22:36.999
If I were to search for it myself,
it could take days.

22:37.069 --> 22:40.300
I'd be sifting through
an almost unimaginable amount of data.

22:40.372 --> 22:44.832
- But it is possible.
- You don't understand. He'd find me.

22:46.478 --> 22:49.072
If you find the cipher first,
we can protect you.

22:49.148 --> 22:52.982
And if I don't? You, of all people,
know what would happen.

22:53.052 --> 22:55.680
He would tear my mind apart
to make me accept him.

22:55.754 --> 23:00.555
If he gets here before we can modify
the weapon, we'll use it to destroy you.

23:00.626 --> 23:03.254
Either way, he will never
get his hands on you again.

23:11.937 --> 23:13.996
There's a subspace link
between all Replicators...

23:14.073 --> 23:16.837
like a wireless Internet connection.

23:16.909 --> 23:19.742
If she taps into it,
she should be able to access the cipher.

23:19.812 --> 23:21.939
<i>She'll also be giving away her position.</i>

23:22.014 --> 23:25.916
It'll take some time for Fifth
to detect her presence on the link.

23:25.984 --> 23:29.511
- If she can isolate the program first-
- <i>That's a big "if.'"</i>

23:29.588 --> 23:33.752
It's risky, sir. I realize that.
But I think it's the only way.

23:33.826 --> 23:35.817
While we're waiting for her
to find the cipher...

23:35.894 --> 23:38.226
we can run tests
on the unmodified disrupter.

23:38.297 --> 23:42.097
We need to analyze the energy output
so we can create a modulation program...

23:42.167 --> 23:45.432
and we need the Asgard to send us
a disrupter satellite as soon as possible.

23:45.504 --> 23:47.734
<i>I've already talked to 'em.</i>

23:47.806 --> 23:51.264
<i>Be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.</i>

23:53.912 --> 23:56.073
I will use an <i>F-302</i>
to place the satellite in orbit.

23:56.148 --> 24:00.380
<i>All right. I hope you guys know</i>
<i>what you're doing.</i>

24:09.928 --> 24:13.261
- Diagnostics are online.
- We're ready.

24:26.078 --> 24:29.275
- Calibration is off.
- Increasing by a factor of 10.

24:29.348 --> 24:31.282
One more time.

24:36.989 --> 24:38.650
That should do it.

24:38.724 --> 24:42.091
Now we need to process all the raw data
so we can attain an algorithmic norm.

24:42.161 --> 24:43.651
That's a lot of information.

24:43.729 --> 24:47.859
It will take some time before we can
compute a heuristic modulation program-

24:47.933 --> 24:49.924
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

24:52.638 --> 24:55.766
- This is Carter. What's happening?
- <i>Stand by, ma'am.</i>

24:58.043 --> 25:00.011
<i>We're receiving a signal.</i>
<i>It's the Asgard.</i>

25:00.078 --> 25:02.342
Understood.

25:02.414 --> 25:05.110
We need that satellite deployed
as soon as possible.

25:05.184 --> 25:07.550
Indeed. Sergeant.

25:11.924 --> 25:15.121
Teal'c, if she were gonna make a move,
I think she would've done it by now.

25:15.194 --> 25:18.288
Perhaps, but it is best to be certain.

25:27.239 --> 25:30.367
- I have Commander Thor on audio, sir.
- Greetings, Thor.

25:30.442 --> 25:34.276
<i>Greetings, Teal'c. The disrupter</i>
<i>satellite is ready for transport.</i>

25:34.346 --> 25:35.836
Very well.

25:35.914 --> 25:39.577
<i>The most effective deployment would be</i>
<i>geosynchronous orbit above your base...</i>

25:39.651 --> 25:45.419
<i>at an altitude of 33,785 kilometers</i>
<i>with zero inclination.</i>

25:46.758 --> 25:50.751
- Understood.
- <i>The satellite is en route now.</i>

25:56.301 --> 25:59.498
<i>Once you have the proper</i>
<i>new modulation program...</i>

25:59.571 --> 26:02.540
<i>you can upload it</i>
<i>from your ground station.</i>

26:02.608 --> 26:06.009
<i>Of course, if you do not have</i>
<i>the program before Fifth's arrival...</i>

26:06.078 --> 26:08.239
<i>the satellite will be useless.</i>

26:08.313 --> 26:10.645
Of that I am aware.

26:10.716 --> 26:12.206
<i>Good luck.</i>

26:23.829 --> 26:27.094
I understand Teal'c's concerns about me.

26:27.165 --> 26:29.929
To be honest, I'm a little surprised
you don't feel the same way.

26:30.002 --> 26:33.597
Teal'c doesn't know what
you've been through. I do.

26:36.775 --> 26:39.369
It wasn't just what I showed you, was it?

26:39.444 --> 26:42.777
- You experienced it yourself.
- Yeah.

26:44.216 --> 26:47.208
That's how I know there's no way
you could be working with Fifth.

26:57.496 --> 26:59.487
What is it?

27:02.200 --> 27:04.668
He's found me. He's on his way.

27:04.736 --> 27:09.173
- Did you find the cipher yet?
- No, I'm still searching.

27:09.241 --> 27:10.640
How much time do we have?

27:10.709 --> 27:14.475
At maximum speed,
he'll be here in less than two hours.

27:23.655 --> 27:25.589
Have you acquired the information?

27:25.657 --> 27:28.148
I'm still analyzing the design
of the disrupter...

27:28.226 --> 27:30.786
but it shouldn't be long before
I can create an effective cipher.

27:30.862 --> 27:34.229
- If I arrive before you finish your work-
- Don't worry.

27:34.299 --> 27:37.632
They won't fire unless I tell them that
the weapon's been properly remodulated.

27:37.703 --> 27:41.605
Humans can be unpredictable,
particularly when they're desperate.

27:41.673 --> 27:45.666
I know what I'm doing. I'm giving her
just enough to keep her hopes up.

27:45.744 --> 27:48.235
The one called O'Neill leads the humans.

27:49.314 --> 27:52.340
It was he who ordered
Samantha Carter to betray me.

27:52.417 --> 27:56.353
But he trusts her. He'll listen to her.

27:59.424 --> 28:03.827
<i>I'm pullin'the plug. Finish off</i>
<i>the Replicator and evacuate the base.</i>

28:03.895 --> 28:05.556
It's too late for that, sir.

28:06.765 --> 28:11.065
If he finds nothing, he's not just gonna
turn around and leave the galaxy.

28:11.136 --> 28:14.037
<i>He's tracking her,</i>
<i>zeroing in on her position.</i>

28:14.106 --> 28:18.566
That's only part of why he's coming.
Think about it. What do Replicators do?

28:18.643 --> 28:22.135
They seek out high-level civilizations
and consume their technology.

28:23.448 --> 28:25.507
- Goa'uld.
- Exactly.

28:25.584 --> 28:28.075
A race that uses all kinds
of advanced technology...

28:28.153 --> 28:30.986
culled from multiple sources,
including the Ancients.

28:31.056 --> 28:33.422
It's like a banquet for the Replicators.

28:33.492 --> 28:36.393
Once they're in this galaxy,
they're not going anywhere.

28:36.461 --> 28:38.952
Now, if she can isolate the cipher soon...

28:39.031 --> 28:42.592
we may still have time
to remodulate the disrupter.

28:42.667 --> 28:45.500
<i>I'll give you one hour. One.</i>

28:45.570 --> 28:48.130
Thank you, sir.
I'd better get back to the lab.

28:48.206 --> 28:51.198
- I will deploy the satellite.
- <i>T.</i>

28:51.276 --> 28:53.267
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

28:56.681 --> 29:00.412
- Proceed, O'Neill.
- <i>I need you to be honest with me.</i>

29:00.485 --> 29:03.215
<i>Is Carter letting herself</i>
<i>get too involved in this one?</i>

29:05.357 --> 29:08.588
Colonel Carter and the Replicator
share thoughts and memories.

29:08.660 --> 29:13.029
It is understandable that a certain...
sympathy would develop between them.

29:13.098 --> 29:15.259
<i>Can't have that.</i>

29:15.333 --> 29:19.292
I do not believe Carter would allow
feelings to interfere with her duties.

29:19.371 --> 29:21.635
<i>Fair enough.</i>

29:21.706 --> 29:26.234
<i>But when the time comes,</i>
<i>I want you to finish thejob.</i>

29:26.311 --> 29:27.801
Understood.

29:39.791 --> 29:42.624
All right. We're running out of time.
We need that-

29:45.097 --> 29:47.088
What is it?

29:48.100 --> 29:50.159
I found the cipher.

29:50.235 --> 29:53.227
I'm downloading it now
from the subspace link.

30:00.612 --> 30:03.740
- I have it.
- Load it into the base mainframe.

30:03.815 --> 30:06.306
It'll require about
three terabytes of memory.

30:06.384 --> 30:09.285
That shouldn't be a problem,
but how do you plan to input the data?

30:10.522 --> 30:12.012
Directly.

30:22.067 --> 30:23.557
Right.

30:29.441 --> 30:31.568
<i>Passing 25 kilometers.</i>

30:31.643 --> 30:34.771
<i>Speed, 5,000 kph and accelerating.</i>

30:34.846 --> 30:37.440
- Acknowledged.
- What's your status?

30:37.516 --> 30:40.508
He's on course for optimum
deployment position in six minutes.

30:42.354 --> 30:44.618
- Teal'c, this is Carter.
- <i>Proceed, Colonel Carter.</i>

30:44.689 --> 30:46.657
We've got the cipher.
By the time you get back...

30:46.725 --> 30:49.285
we should have the modulation
program ready for upload.

30:49.361 --> 30:52.159
<i>That is indeed good news.</i>
<i>Well done.</i>

30:53.365 --> 30:56.232
- We are nearing your position.
- I know.

30:56.301 --> 30:57.962
Do the humans suspect?

30:58.036 --> 31:01.802
They're proceeding with their plan
to deploy an Asgard disrupter satellite.

31:01.873 --> 31:04.467
They have no idea.

31:13.118 --> 31:16.110
<i>Flight, I'm approaching</i>
<i>optimum deployment position.</i>

31:17.189 --> 31:20.181
Copy that, Teal'c.
ODP in 15 seconds.

31:21.726 --> 31:25.526
Final course correction... now.

31:25.597 --> 31:29.294
Tracking shows you are on course.
Inclination?

31:29.367 --> 31:32.894
<i>Inclination... zero.</i>

31:32.971 --> 31:36.873
Copy.
ODP in five seconds, on my mark.

31:36.942 --> 31:40.673
Five, four, three...

31:40.745 --> 31:43.509
two, one.

31:43.582 --> 31:44.913
Mark.

31:50.288 --> 31:52.620
Satellite away.

31:54.392 --> 31:56.417
Receiving satellite transmission.

31:56.494 --> 31:58.655
- Patch it through.
- Yes, ma'am.

32:05.370 --> 32:08.931
Telemetry established.
Good job, Teal'c.

32:09.007 --> 32:11.942
Copy, Flight.
Returning to base.

32:12.010 --> 32:14.137
The deployment went well, I take it?

32:16.047 --> 32:18.311
That's right. We did our part-

32:18.383 --> 32:20.544
And I've done mine.

32:22.053 --> 32:24.647
You've finished the calculations?

32:24.723 --> 32:26.657
The modulation is complete.

32:26.725 --> 32:30.718
With this program, you should be able
to destroy any Replicators you encounter.

32:33.331 --> 32:35.322
There's no way to test it.

32:36.501 --> 32:39.629
If I had more time, I could run
a series of simulations...

32:39.704 --> 32:42.468
but you'd never really know for sure
until you tried to use it.

32:57.255 --> 32:58.847
Uplink initiated.

33:01.192 --> 33:05.458
There's a lot of data. It'll take about
15 minutes to remodulate the satellite.

33:07.899 --> 33:09.389
Proximity alert!

33:12.671 --> 33:15.936
<i>Long-range scanner has picked up</i>
<i>a ship on course for this base.</i>

33:16.608 --> 33:18.542
Analyzing energy signature.

33:20.545 --> 33:22.536
We got something here,
but I don't know what it is.

33:22.614 --> 33:25.708
I do. It's a Replicator ship.

33:27.919 --> 33:30.444
He got here sooner than I thought.

33:43.001 --> 33:45.469
The weapon will not
become effective in time.

33:45.537 --> 33:47.027
I know.

33:49.374 --> 33:52.104
All personnel, begin evacuation
procedures immediately.

33:52.177 --> 33:54.338
Repeat, begin evacuation.

33:54.412 --> 33:57.108
We need to download the modulation
program into a portable drive...

33:57.182 --> 33:59.377
and erase everything else.

33:59.451 --> 34:01.180
Yes, ma'am.

34:01.252 --> 34:04.187
- What of the Replicator?
- We're taking her with us.

34:05.824 --> 34:08.486
The disrupter. Vacate the room.

34:13.765 --> 34:15.699
Teal'c, what are you doing?

34:16.835 --> 34:19.269
We cannot bring her to Earth.

34:19.337 --> 34:22.170
- We have the modulation program.
- But we haven't tested it.

34:22.240 --> 34:25.573
What if Fifth alters the cipher? If he
figures out what we were trying to do-

34:25.643 --> 34:29.079
O'Neill would never allow a human-form
Replicator access to Stargate Command.

34:29.147 --> 34:31.638
Yes, he would,
if he knew what was at stake.

34:32.951 --> 34:35.579
The Asgard satellite is armed.

34:35.653 --> 34:38.417
- You said the humans wouldn't fire.
- They won't.

34:38.490 --> 34:41.357
They still think
the weapon is ineffective.

34:41.426 --> 34:43.360
They're even more gullible than you.

34:50.001 --> 34:53.368
- What are you doing?
- What I came here to do.

34:55.306 --> 34:58.605
- She fired the weapon.
- The Replicator ship is breaking up.

35:04.115 --> 35:06.583
Why?

35:06.651 --> 35:10.143
You should know.
You made me what I am.

35:26.171 --> 35:28.765
- The ship has been destroyed.
- That's impossible.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.468
- Did we finish the upload?
- Not even close.

35:32.844 --> 35:35.176
You were right about one thing,
Colonel.

35:35.246 --> 35:38.409
I was never working with Fifth,
although he didn't know it.

36:08.613 --> 36:12.709
That's better. Now we can take
our time and have a little talk.

36:12.784 --> 36:16.117
Of course, only a few seconds
will pass in the real world.

36:17.021 --> 36:20.184
- Why did you bring me here?
- I wanted to thank you.

36:21.493 --> 36:24.189
You gave me the opportunity
to study the disrupter...

36:24.262 --> 36:26.890
and that allowed me
to make myself immune to its effects.

36:27.699 --> 36:30.167
- There never was a cipher.
- Until now.

36:30.235 --> 36:33.068
I've already begun uploading it
into the link.

36:33.137 --> 36:38.336
Soon all my brethren will have the new
program, and they will be unstoppable.

36:38.409 --> 36:41.401
- And you'll be their leader.
- That's right.

36:41.479 --> 36:44.676
So this whole thing was a setup.
You just wanted to get rid of Fifth.

36:44.749 --> 36:46.979
Fifth was pathetic.

36:47.051 --> 36:49.417
And to think,
he expected us to love him.

36:51.623 --> 36:56.185
Fifth was flawed, and if I had to
destroy him, I would, but-

36:56.261 --> 36:57.922
But what?

36:57.996 --> 37:01.830
You feel sorry for him?
Don't bother.

37:01.900 --> 37:03.891
He was never fit to lead an army...

37:03.968 --> 37:06.562
and he certainly wasn't fit
to rule this galaxy.

37:06.638 --> 37:08.037
But you are?

37:09.607 --> 37:11.598
I am what I am because of you.

37:12.577 --> 37:15.546
You're not me.
You're what Fifth made you.

37:15.613 --> 37:19.310
You have untapped greatness
inside you, Sam...

37:19.384 --> 37:22.012
but you're limited by your own fears.

37:22.086 --> 37:26.523
You play by the rules, do as you're told,
and you deny yourself your own desires.

37:27.725 --> 37:30.455
I have no desire to rule the galaxy,
believe me.

37:30.528 --> 37:32.519
All humans desire power.

37:33.898 --> 37:36.594
It's just that most of them
are never in a position to attain it.

37:38.202 --> 37:40.033
We will stop you.

37:40.104 --> 37:44.097
You're forgetting,
I know exactly how your mind works.

37:45.243 --> 37:47.768
I know what you're going to do
before you even think of it.

37:54.586 --> 37:56.986
You set the naquadah generators
to overload.

37:57.055 --> 38:00.047
Trying to blow up the base
before I can leave.

38:06.564 --> 38:09.397
Dialing computer's off line.
We've lost power, sir.

38:28.019 --> 38:31.284
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

38:32.357 --> 38:35.349
She's heading for the gate room.
We have to stop her.

38:39.864 --> 38:42.492
See if you can get it coming back online.

38:52.710 --> 38:54.678
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

38:54.746 --> 38:56.270
Stop!

38:57.181 --> 38:59.012
Fire!

40:06.584 --> 40:09.348
- Disengage the wormhole!
- She's locked out the controls!

40:37.949 --> 40:40.645
Get it back online. You all right?

40:49.060 --> 40:51.324
Teal'c, what have I done?

40:51.395 --> 40:54.421
You cannot be held responsible
for the actions of the Replicator.

41:10.014 --> 41:12.073
You know,
I'm still of a strong belief...

41:12.150 --> 41:15.210
that it's a bad idea
to have that stuff on the base.

41:15.286 --> 41:19.052
She deactivated these cells
when she separated them from her arm.

41:19.123 --> 41:22.024
Can we be certain
they will not become active again?

41:22.093 --> 41:24.687
She deliberately shut down
the cohesive energy between them...

41:24.762 --> 41:28.755
so it would be harder to figure out how
she made herself immune to the disrupter.

41:28.833 --> 41:30.357
How do you know that?

41:33.371 --> 41:35.362
Because that's what I would've done.

41:45.049 --> 41:47.813
Sir, if you don't mind,
I've got a lot of work to do.

41:47.885 --> 41:51.844
We've never had the opportunity to study
human-form Replicator cells before.

41:51.923 --> 41:54.824
If we can learn something from them,
this won't be a total loss.

41:54.892 --> 41:56.484
This isn't your fault.

41:58.629 --> 42:00.995
I'm not so sure about that.

42:01.065 --> 42:03.499
Fifth came here because of me.

42:03.568 --> 42:06.196
She rejected him
because she was made like me.

42:06.270 --> 42:08.261
Now we've got Replicators
in our galaxy...

42:08.339 --> 42:10.967
and they're immune to the only technology
we have that could've stopped them.

42:11.042 --> 42:14.307
None of us correctly anticipated
the actions of the Replicator.

42:14.378 --> 42:16.642
I thought she was afraid of him...

42:16.714 --> 42:20.878
but she just wanted to get rid of him
so she could lead the Replicators herself.

42:20.952 --> 42:23.420
She killed him because
she thought he was weak.

42:25.356 --> 42:27.051
She isn't you.

42:27.124 --> 42:31.891
O'Neill is correct. Though she shared your
memories, her personality was altered.

42:33.631 --> 42:37.294
But the fact is,
she learned betrayal from Fifth...

42:38.436 --> 42:40.427
and he learned it from me.
