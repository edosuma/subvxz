00:02.080 --> 00:04.100
<i>Previously on</i>
"Tyrant"

00:04.100 --> 00:05.689
I've been waiting for you
in the dairy shed.

00:05.689 --> 00:07.490
You were supposed
to help me make yogurt.

00:07.492 --> 00:10.193
I'm helping Khalil.

00:10.195 --> 00:11.394
[Ahmos] <i>He's been
distancing</i>

00:11.396 --> 00:13.663
himself lately
from his mother.

00:13.665 --> 00:16.566
- I think because she's leaving.
- Daliyah's leaving?

00:16.568 --> 00:17.734
For Germany.

00:17.736 --> 00:19.135
She's been accepted
at a program

00:19.137 --> 00:21.738
to bring solar power
to our village.

00:21.740 --> 00:23.573
- Where are the documents?
- What's wrong?

00:24.342 --> 00:26.576
[screaming] No, no!
Samira!

00:28.570 --> 00:30.580
[Samira gasping, panting]

00:30.582 --> 00:32.749
[Ihab] Abu Omar.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.184
- I should have known it was you.
- You know him?

00:35.186 --> 00:36.920
I want to help you
liberate Abuddin

00:36.922 --> 00:39.188
from the apostate
 Al Fayeeds.

00:39.190 --> 00:41.691
[Jamal] <i>I said there was
 to be no gas.</i>

00:41.693 --> 00:43.893
[gagging]

00:43.895 --> 00:46.729
- [Ahmos] <i>Yesterday in Ma'an... a thousand</i>
- [people screaming in terror]

00:46.731 --> 00:49.232
people dead.

00:49.234 --> 00:51.100
The legal team representing
the Al Fayeed trust

00:51.102 --> 00:52.735
is contesting the will.

00:52.737 --> 00:54.571
Okay, so how
 do I get it?

00:54.573 --> 00:58.007
You need to appear
in court in Abuddin.

00:58.009 --> 01:01.377
About the solar program...
It could make a real difference

01:01.379 --> 01:02.946
to people's lives here.

01:02.948 --> 01:05.848
I'll watch over Ghani
while you're gone.

01:07.452 --> 01:11.387
What kind of person
slaughters innocent people?

01:11.389 --> 01:13.756
I could.

01:13.758 --> 01:19.629
If Abu Omar can open
the palace gates...

01:19.631 --> 01:23.800
so I can slit the throat
of Jamal Al Fayeed.

01:23.802 --> 01:26.769
I could do those things
and so could you.

01:26.771 --> 01:29.505
You will be the first solar
engineer from Abuddin.

01:30.642 --> 01:33.643
[screaming, shouting]

01:33.643 --> 01:35.640
[German woman whimpering]

01:35.640 --> 01:37.640
[man gives orders, speaks local language]

[goats bleating]
[low hum of chat]

01:47.659 --> 01:51.628
[Bassam] So when the
 shadow moves around

01:51.630 --> 01:55.798
[donkey braying]
and passes... this stone,

01:55.800 --> 01:57.734
your mom
 will be in Germany.

01:57.736 --> 01:59.636
Okay.

01:59.638 --> 02:02.071
But I'd rather have
a iPhone to tell the time.

02:02.073 --> 02:03.439
[chuckles]

02:03.441 --> 02:04.807
Well, maybe one day,
if you're lucky,

02:04.809 --> 02:06.342
your dad'll buy you one.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.279
- [Ahmos chuckles]
- The Sumerians invented

02:10.281 --> 02:12.448
the sundial
 when this whole land

02:12.450 --> 02:13.916
was a country
called Mesopotamia.

02:13.918 --> 02:15.618
Different name.

02:15.620 --> 02:17.086
Same land.

02:17.088 --> 02:19.088
Same people.

02:19.090 --> 02:20.857
[low rumbling]

02:24.850 --> 02:28.850
[sound turns louder]
[man speaks indistinctly]

 of Tal Jiza,

02:33.838 --> 02:34.838
come to the square.

02:34.839 --> 02:37.674
You've been liberated

02:37.676 --> 02:40.143
by the Army
 of the Caliphate.

02:40.145 --> 02:44.881
People of Tal Jiza,
come to the square.

02:44.883 --> 02:49.118
You've been liberated
by the Army of the Caliphate.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.889
People of Tal Jiza...
come to the square.

02:52.891 --> 02:54.857
You've been liberated

02:54.859 --> 02:57.293
by the Army
 of the Caliphate.

02:58.797 --> 03:00.163
What is happening?

03:00.165 --> 03:05.868
[over bullhorn] People of Tal Jiza,
come to the square.

03:05.870 --> 03:09.505
You have been liberated
by the Army of the Caliphate.

03:09.507 --> 03:11.374
- [soldier] Go, go. 
- [over bullhorn] People of Tal Jiza,

03:11.376 --> 03:13.876
come to the square.

03:13.878 --> 03:17.680
You have been liberated
by the Army of the Caliphate.

03:17.682 --> 03:20.583
Follow the soldiers
to the square.

03:20.585 --> 03:24.687
People of Tal Jiza,
come to the square.

03:24.689 --> 03:27.990
You've been liberated
by the Army of the Caliphate.

03:27.992 --> 03:29.759
What's its range?

03:29.761 --> 03:31.494
2,000 meters.

03:31.496 --> 03:34.764
- But in my hands, it's a bit more.
- [calling to gathering continues]

03:34.766 --> 03:37.734
- Very cool. What?
- [calling to gathering continues]

03:37.736 --> 03:40.103
Don't talk to them,
don't even look at them.

03:40.105 --> 03:42.105
Not looking at them
won't make them go, okay?

03:42.107 --> 03:43.773
Come to the square.

03:43.775 --> 03:46.776
- You have been liberated
- [soldiers giving orders]

03:46.778 --> 03:49.178
by the Army of the Caliphate.

03:49.180 --> 03:52.910
Jill, what are you doing
just standing there?

03:52.910 --> 03:54.584
Make yourself useful.

03:54.586 --> 03:55.952
And show some enthusiasm.

03:55.954 --> 03:57.186
I'm doing my best.

03:57.188 --> 03:59.789
You're my wife.
At least try to look like

03:59.791 --> 04:01.390
you are glad to be here.

04:01.392 --> 04:02.959
Remember to keep the camera
running no matter what,

04:02.961 --> 04:04.761
and keep my husband in frame.

04:04.761 --> 04:06.530
[engine revving]

04:06.530 --> 04:07.964
You look tired.

04:07.966 --> 04:09.866
Another night
of comforting Faisel?

04:09.868 --> 04:12.735
We don't call that "comforting"
in America. We call it rape.

04:12.737 --> 04:15.738
A wife should do
 as she's told.

04:15.740 --> 04:17.607
It will get easier.

04:17.608 --> 04:20.041
Welcome, my friend.

04:20.043 --> 04:21.944
Come, come.

04:21.946 --> 04:23.780
Take them up,
everybody's waiting.

04:23.782 --> 04:27.840
- Sir.
- [soldiers giving orders to man]

04:28.787 --> 04:31.587
God honors the valiant man
who slays the unbeliever

04:31.589 --> 04:35.258
that brings death
 to his people.

04:35.260 --> 04:37.690
You'll be great.

04:39.690 --> 04:43.690
[low hum of chat]

04:47.472 --> 04:49.906
Why are you smiling?

04:49.908 --> 04:51.974
I don't know.

04:53.444 --> 04:55.970
Oh, shit.

04:55.970 --> 04:58.970
[German woman whimpering]

05:02.487 --> 05:04.821
Oh, my God.

05:04.823 --> 05:07.690
[whispers] Ahmos, no, no.
They will kill her.

05:07.692 --> 05:09.192
They'll kill you, too.

05:09.194 --> 05:10.827
And then what happens
to your family?

05:10.829 --> 05:12.862
- They all need you.
- [Ghani] Pick me up, Baba.

05:12.864 --> 05:14.984
I can't see anything.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.934
There's not much
for you to see, son.

05:17.936 --> 05:20.603
So let's play a game,
you and me, yeah?

05:20.605 --> 05:23.272
What game?

05:23.274 --> 05:25.875
Close your eyes,
 cover your ears

05:25.877 --> 05:29.612
and count 
as fast as you can.

05:29.614 --> 05:31.848
I'll do the same.

05:31.850 --> 05:33.716
Whoever counts highest wins.

05:33.718 --> 05:37.220
Okay? Ready, set, go.

05:37.222 --> 05:39.388
[both] One, two,

05:39.390 --> 05:42.892
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten,

05:42.894 --> 05:46.963
11, 12, 13... 14, 15, 16,

05:46.965 --> 05:49.732
- I am Ihab Rashid.
- [Ghani] 17, 18, 19, 20,

05:49.734 --> 05:55.338
- [Ghani] 21, 22, 23, 24...
- [Ihab] Son of Sheik Rashid,

05:55.340 --> 05:58.507
son of Abuddin.

05:58.509 --> 06:01.711
Humble servant of God.

06:01.713 --> 06:03.880
Our so-called
 government

06:03.882 --> 06:06.082
thought they had
 finished me.

06:06.084 --> 06:08.384
Jamal Al Fayeed
thought he had finished me.

06:10.521 --> 06:13.689
But Jamal Al Fayeed only
strengthened my faith.

06:13.691 --> 06:16.058
And so now...

06:16.060 --> 06:19.695
I have sworn allegiance
to the Army of the Caliphate.

06:19.697 --> 06:22.932
Good people of Tal Jiza,

06:22.934 --> 06:25.668
I've come home
 to liberate you

06:25.670 --> 06:28.070
from his apostate rule

06:28.072 --> 06:30.940
and from his collaborators.

06:30.942 --> 06:32.642
Like this man.

06:35.046 --> 06:39.382
This man, who
belongs to a regime

06:39.384 --> 06:42.451
that gasses
 its own people.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.950
[cocks gun]

06:46.950 --> 06:51.093
We have been denied
justice for too long.

06:51.095 --> 06:53.362
Today it is God's will

06:53.364 --> 06:55.631
that justice be done.

06:56.630 --> 06:59.360
[gunshot]
[crowd exclaims]

06:59.360 --> 07:02.360
[body thuds]
[Daliyah shivering]

07:03.274 --> 07:07.977
- 51, 52, 53... 
- [people murmuring indistinctly]

07:07.979 --> 07:10.279
Get a lower angle
 this time.

07:10.281 --> 07:13.115
Don't let them
 kill me, please.

07:13.117 --> 07:18.220
[Ihab] Or this woman who comes
here from the West

07:18.222 --> 07:20.990
to lead our women
on the wrong path.

07:20.992 --> 07:23.993
We have been denied justice
for far too long.

07:23.995 --> 07:28.397
But today it is God's will
that justice is done.

07:28.397 --> 07:30.335
[woman sobbing]

07:30.335 --> 07:32.335
[sobbing] Don't kill me,
 please.

07:32.337 --> 07:34.403
[gunshot]
[blood squirts]

07:34.403 --> 07:37.140
- [Jill screams]
- [Ahmos sobbing]

07:37.141 --> 07:39.008
67, 68...

07:39.008 --> 07:41.000
[Daliyah breaths heavily]

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
[not audible words]

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
[breathing anxiously]

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
[praying in Arabic]

07:58.796 --> 08:00.663
This woman, 
you all know her.

08:02.467 --> 08:06.202
She's from the village, she
has strayed from God's path.

08:06.204 --> 08:09.839
But the Army of the Caliphate
knows of the power of mercy.

08:12.276 --> 08:14.343
Come, get up.

08:14.610 --> 08:16.614
[flag flapping]

08:16.614 --> 08:19.148
Return to your family.

08:19.150 --> 08:21.150
Ask their forgiveness.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.352
Ask God's forgiveness.

08:26.791 --> 08:29.792
Yes, my friends, the Caliphate
knows the power of God's mercy.

08:29.794 --> 08:32.294
Ghani, you won. [chuckles]

08:32.296 --> 08:33.830
- You won.
- [Ihab's speech continues in background]

08:33.831 --> 08:35.131
- And look who's here.
- [Ihab's speech continues in background]

08:35.133 --> 08:36.966
Ommah!

08:42.073 --> 08:44.774
Ommah!

08:47.045 --> 08:51.047
[Ihab] We have come to Tal Jiza
on our way to Ma'an.

08:51.049 --> 08:54.316
Once we've liberated Ma'an,
we're moving on to Asima,

08:54.318 --> 08:59.155
where Jamal Al Fayeed will
finally know God's justice.

09:00.258 --> 09:03.826
To fulfill 
 this sacred cause,

09:03.828 --> 09:07.063
the sons of Tal Jiza
will become soldiers

09:07.065 --> 09:08.931
in the Army
 of the Caliphate.

09:08.933 --> 09:11.233
So every able-bodied
 mujahed

09:11.235 --> 09:14.103
between the ages of 15
and 50 will assemble here

09:14.105 --> 09:17.039
- after the <i> Asr</i> prayer.
- [people murmuring]

09:17.030 --> 09:19.175
- He's taking our sons.
- [people murmuring]

09:20.711 --> 09:23.546
[Ihab] We will remove
 this tyrant,

09:23.548 --> 09:28.084
and we will restore
God's law in this land.

09:28.086 --> 09:29.718
<i>- Takbeer!</i>
- [all] <i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

09:29.720 --> 09:35.691

Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio

10:44.830 --> 10:46.330
[door opens]

10:46.330 --> 10:48.030
I need to see
 the President.

10:48.032 --> 10:50.332
It's urgent.

10:50.332 --> 10:51.730
[door closes]

10:51.730 --> 10:54.537
The Chinese ambassador
sent this to me.

10:54.539 --> 10:57.006
- Solid gold.
- Mr. President...

10:57.008 --> 11:00.209
I have to think of something
to send him in return.

11:00.211 --> 11:03.946
Today, Uncle,
 the first new well

11:03.948 --> 11:06.849
in the Ma'an oil fields
becomes operational.

11:06.851 --> 11:08.384
Mr. President,

11:08.386 --> 11:11.320
approximately
 five hours ago,

11:11.322 --> 11:13.789
the Kassab Road Garrison
was overrun

11:13.791 --> 11:16.525
by a division
from the Army of the Caliphate.

11:16.527 --> 11:19.461
The Caliphate?

11:19.463 --> 11:21.363
In Abuddin?

11:21.365 --> 11:24.867
They executed
176 soldiers,

11:24.869 --> 11:27.169
looted the armory.

11:27.171 --> 11:28.737
Light tanks,
 heavy artillery.

11:28.739 --> 11:30.206
Nothing left behind.

11:32.743 --> 11:36.645
The good news is,
we are in communication

11:36.647 --> 11:40.316
with a half dozen men
who were able to escape.

11:40.318 --> 11:41.817
That's the
 good news?

11:41.819 --> 11:44.253
They managed to track
the Caliphate forces

11:44.255 --> 11:47.656
to a rural village, Tal Jiza.

11:47.658 --> 11:51.360
We suspect they're conscripting
men to fortify their ranks

11:51.362 --> 11:53.929
before moving on
 to Ma'an.

11:55.866 --> 11:58.234
Ma'an?

11:59.403 --> 12:03.672
It's the closest
 major city, and

12:03.674 --> 12:06.909
the Caliphate may find
sympathizers there.

12:06.911 --> 12:09.111
Because you gassed them.

12:09.113 --> 12:12.414
And there's the oil.

12:12.416 --> 12:14.183
And the Chinese.

12:16.354 --> 12:18.721
I've already ordered
the immediate evacuation

12:18.723 --> 12:21.290
of any Chinese nationals
who might be in harm's way.

12:21.292 --> 12:23.626
But I assure you,
this will be handled.

12:23.628 --> 12:26.262
[inhales deeply]

12:27.898 --> 12:30.432
Convene the council

12:30.434 --> 12:33.969
so that I can evaluate
your response to this crisis.

12:39.076 --> 12:42.278
You do have a response
to this crisis, right?

12:42.280 --> 12:44.446
Of course, Mr. President.

12:44.448 --> 12:46.282
Good.

12:50.488 --> 12:52.488
[indistinct chatter]

12:52.490 --> 12:54.423
Are you home
for good now, Ommah?

12:54.425 --> 12:57.726
Yes, my cub, I will
never leave you again.

12:57.726 --> 12:59.960
[chattering continues]

12:59.964 --> 13:03.332
These men...
What are they doing in Tal Jiza?

13:03.334 --> 13:05.100
Don't worry about that now.

13:05.102 --> 13:06.302
You'll be fine.

13:06.304 --> 13:07.836
You're tired?

13:07.838 --> 13:10.272
You'll nap at home.

13:10.274 --> 13:12.474
[Nasrin] We can't just
let them take our sons.

13:12.476 --> 13:14.443
[Ahmos] We're not <i> letting</i> them
do anything.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.845
Will you talk to him then?

13:16.847 --> 13:19.315
Go inside with the boys.
Help them pack.

13:19.317 --> 13:21.450
- Khalil?
- [Caliphate speech in background]

13:21.452 --> 13:25.754
Can we talk?
[engine revving]

13:25.756 --> 13:31.160
[speech continues]

13:31.162 --> 13:34.430
I am not a man
to trade hospitality,

13:34.432 --> 13:37.299
but please look
 after my sons.

13:37.301 --> 13:40.469
Munir is simple,
Kasim is reckless.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.504
I fear for them.

13:42.506 --> 13:44.206
Knowing that
 you are watching

13:44.208 --> 13:47.743
would mean everything
to their mother and to me.

13:48.979 --> 13:51.880
Ahmos, I can't.

13:51.882 --> 13:54.183
You and your family

13:54.185 --> 13:56.352
have shown me more kindness
than I've ever known,

13:56.354 --> 13:58.487
but I can't go
with the Caliphate.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.456
I have to leave.

14:00.458 --> 14:01.990
Leave?

14:01.992 --> 14:03.559
How do you expect
 to leave?

14:03.561 --> 14:05.527
They have sealed
 the village.

14:05.529 --> 14:06.962
Leaving is not an option.

14:06.964 --> 14:08.464
You don't understand.

14:08.466 --> 14:10.499
For me,<i> staying</i>
is not an option.

14:10.501 --> 14:14.837
Oh, I think I do understand
better than you do.

14:14.839 --> 14:17.906
[sighs] Ahmos, I would do
anything for you, but...

14:17.908 --> 14:21.377
Then do this.

14:21.379 --> 14:24.179
Look, I am an enemy 
of the State

14:24.181 --> 14:26.248
but I am also an
enemy of the Caliphate.

14:26.250 --> 14:29.585
If they see me, they will kill
me and anyone that I am with.

14:29.587 --> 14:31.053
Including your sons.

14:31.055 --> 14:33.555
You are just a runner,
aren't you?

14:33.557 --> 14:36.258
You run away
 from your family,

14:36.260 --> 14:39.027
run away from the army,
run away from the Caliphate.

14:39.029 --> 14:42.264
Now I ask you a favor,
you away run from me.

14:42.266 --> 14:45.401
Look, I know it
seems that way...

14:45.403 --> 14:48.003
It is that way.

14:54.678 --> 14:56.378
[sighs]

14:56.380 --> 15:00.682
If you do somehow get
away, God willing,

15:00.684 --> 15:04.019
follow the road north
for 17 kilometers,

15:04.021 --> 15:06.288
then west for ten.

15:06.290 --> 15:09.525
You will see a foot path that
will take you to some Bedouin.

15:09.525 --> 15:12.520
[footsteps approaching]

15:13.397 --> 15:15.597
Give this to any Bedu.

15:15.599 --> 15:18.400
They will help you
get to Beirut.

15:18.402 --> 15:20.869
Thank you.

15:20.871 --> 15:24.540
Don't thank me.
 It's our custom.

15:36.487 --> 15:40.722
We should have turned him
in when we had the chance.

15:40.724 --> 15:43.284
You could have
 gotten money.

15:58.676 --> 16:02.277
[sports broadcast on radio]

16:02.279 --> 16:05.347
[crying softly]

16:05.347 --> 16:07.340
[flags flapping]

16:07.340 --> 16:12.340
[crying continues]

16:12.340 --> 16:18.340
[broadcast on radio continues]

16:23.534 --> 16:25.100
- Don't move. 
- [man panting]

16:25.102 --> 16:27.102
Step back.
 Keep your hands up.

16:27.104 --> 16:29.538
I just want the truck, okay?

16:29.540 --> 16:32.674
I'm... I'm gonna take you
to a shed and tie you up.

16:32.676 --> 16:34.510
Just keep your hands up.

16:34.512 --> 16:37.713
[grunting]

16:37.713 --> 16:39.710
[glass shattering]

16:39.710 --> 16:41.710

16:41.986 --> 16:43.752
[grunting]

16:45.523 --> 16:47.523

[hinges squeaking]

17:34.450 --> 17:36.450
[Bassam breathing heavily]

17:50.387 --> 17:52.387
[reporter] Horrible mistake
from the young goalkeeper.

17:52.389 --> 17:54.790
That is the risk you take
when you come out that far.

17:54.792 --> 17:56.712
[broadcast continues indistinctly]

18:02.199 --> 18:04.766
You're not a Caliphate.

18:04.768 --> 18:06.234
I will kill you.

18:06.236 --> 18:08.270
Do you understand me?

18:08.272 --> 18:10.806
What do you
 want me to do?

18:10.808 --> 18:12.774
Go!

18:12.776 --> 18:14.610
[engine starting]

18:16.780 --> 18:19.982
You were stealing this
to go where?

18:19.984 --> 18:22.050
Lebanon.

18:22.052 --> 18:23.885
For what?

18:25.456 --> 18:27.589
To do what?!

18:27.591 --> 18:29.958
There's a
 checkpoint ahead.

18:31.462 --> 18:34.029
[groans softly]

18:38.736 --> 18:41.570
Salaam alaikum.

18:41.570 --> 18:43.500
[soldier speaks indistinctly]

18:43.500 --> 18:45.867
Let me see
 your identification.

18:47.177 --> 18:49.745
You are Faisel's wife.

18:58.689 --> 19:00.756
Let them pass.

19:00.756 --> 19:04.750
[engine roaring]

19:14.830 --> 19:18.270
You're the girl  from
 the square with the camera.

19:18.275 --> 19:20.509
Not anymore.

19:20.511 --> 19:22.878
Now drive us to Lebanon.

19:26.216 --> 19:29.851
[Jamal clears throat] All right, General.

19:29.853 --> 19:32.888
Tell the council
what is your plan

19:32.890 --> 19:36.858
to stop these evil killers
from reaching Ma'an.

19:36.860 --> 19:41.029
Before we begin,
Mr. President, you should know

19:41.031 --> 19:43.765
that this incursion
into Abuddin...

19:46.236 --> 19:48.236
Our intelligence suggests

19:48.238 --> 19:49.871
that the Caliphate forces

19:49.873 --> 19:52.874
are being led 
by Ihab Rashid.

19:54.712 --> 19:58.580
What are you
 talking about?

19:58.582 --> 20:00.749
Ihab Rashid is dead.

20:00.751 --> 20:06.054
Actually, uh, we never
recovered his body.

20:06.056 --> 20:10.920
It appears
 he fled to Syria.

20:10.928 --> 20:12.728
Joining the Army
of the Caliphate

20:12.730 --> 20:14.496
under the command
 of Abu Omar,

20:14.498 --> 20:18.166
with whom he attended
university.

20:18.168 --> 20:22.003
So you gassed
 Ma'an for nothing.

20:22.005 --> 20:23.605
I disagree.

20:23.607 --> 20:26.775
We crushed
 Ihab's insurgency.

20:26.777 --> 20:29.077
Crushed? Really?

20:29.079 --> 20:30.946
Is that what you call it?

20:30.948 --> 20:33.715
Only to have him spring up
like a rat

20:33.717 --> 20:36.752
from another hole
with the Caliphate Army?

20:36.754 --> 20:40.522
How did you not know
about this until now?

20:40.524 --> 20:43.925
Admittedly, it was a failure
of intelligence.

20:43.927 --> 20:45.727
Oh,

20:45.729 --> 20:50.160
General, you are way
too easy on yourself.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.604
[Jamal's hand thuds on table]

20:53.604 --> 20:55.604
So now what?

20:55.606 --> 20:57.939
Now what?

20:57.941 --> 21:02.611
How do we protect
our country, our oil?

21:02.613 --> 21:07.549
How do we keep Ihab Rashid
and these barbarians

21:07.551 --> 21:12.320
from cutting off the heads
of the Chinese engineers working

21:12.322 --> 21:15.323
in Ma'an at our invitation

21:15.325 --> 21:18.827
and putting them
on top of our oil derricks?

21:18.829 --> 21:21.630
[Tariq] Mr. President.

21:21.632 --> 21:26.468
There are only two roads
into and out of Tal Jiza.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.940
Four attack helicopters
from our base

21:31.942 --> 21:35.240
in Taltahar will crater
 both roads, [taps twice on map]

21:35.240 --> 21:38.446
effectively trapping the
enemy forces inside Tal Jiza,

21:38.448 --> 21:39.981
so armored divisions

21:39.983 --> 21:43.585
and artillery can lay
siege to the village.

21:43.587 --> 21:47.823
For God's sake, there are
civilians in Tal Jiza.

21:47.825 --> 21:52.360
Who've sworn their loyalty
to the Caliphate.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.360
[pen thuds]

22:01.872 --> 22:04.272
I am meeting
with the Chinese ambassador

22:04.274 --> 22:08.043
to tell him that
this incursion will be stopped,

22:08.045 --> 22:11.847
that his citizens in Ma'an
are in no danger.

22:11.849 --> 22:15.383
He will believe this
because I will give him my word.

22:15.385 --> 22:17.452
And you will not make
a liar of me.

22:32.970 --> 22:34.202
[thud] 
Please don't!

22:34.204 --> 22:36.204
Tell Faisel
who kidnapped his wife

22:36.206 --> 22:38.907
before your wives
have no husband.

22:38.909 --> 22:41.076
I can't tell you
what I don't know.

22:41.078 --> 22:43.879
Maybe Faisel can
help you remember.

22:43.881 --> 22:46.014
- [Ahmos gasping]
- [Faisel] He killed one of my fighters,

22:46.016 --> 22:48.516
- and he took my wife.
- [Nasrin whimpering]

22:48.518 --> 22:51.086
Tell me where this man is.

22:51.088 --> 22:52.954
I don't know.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.950
[Ahmos gasping]

22:55.692 --> 22:59.394
We have, uh, witnesses
who say he's your cousin.

23:01.531 --> 23:04.065
He's a stranger,

23:04.067 --> 23:06.568
someone
 we let into our home.

23:06.570 --> 23:10.739
So you must know
 where he went.

23:11.942 --> 23:15.577
No, I don't.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.747
Lebanon.

23:18.749 --> 23:21.583
He's going to Lebanon.

23:21.585 --> 23:24.085
Kasim.

23:25.355 --> 23:28.356
Tell me why I
shouldn't tell them.

23:28.358 --> 23:30.358
I owe Khalil nothing.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.960
None of us do.

23:34.898 --> 23:37.966
My father
 is a good Bedu.

23:38.969 --> 23:41.136
He gave shelter to a...

23:41.138 --> 23:44.205
to a stranger, that's all.

23:44.207 --> 23:47.042
This man, Khalil, do you know
where he's crossing the border?

23:53.540 --> 23:56.040
[engine roaring]

23:56.086 --> 23:59.587
How far is it to Lebanon?

23:59.589 --> 24:02.290
Um... another hour,
maybe a bit more.

24:02.292 --> 24:05.627
Think maybe you could take
that thing off my neck?

24:07.597 --> 24:09.664
How are we getting
across the border?

24:11.601 --> 24:13.401
There's a Bedouin
camp on this side.

24:13.403 --> 24:16.571
If I show them this,

24:16.573 --> 24:19.133
then they'll get us across.

24:19.977 --> 24:22.043
You sound American.

24:24.181 --> 24:25.181
You CIA?

24:25.182 --> 24:27.983
[scoffs]

24:27.985 --> 24:30.785
No, I'm a doctor...
<i>was</i> a doctor.

24:30.787 --> 24:33.788
[scoffs] Yeah, right.

24:33.790 --> 24:35.857
What kind of doctor
kills people?

24:42.165 --> 24:44.165
That wasn't my intention.

24:44.167 --> 24:46.001
All I wanted was...

24:46.001 --> 24:48.000
[sighs deeply]

24:49.106 --> 24:51.439
Forget it,
 it doesn't matter.

24:53.210 --> 24:57.779
Say I believe you,
you're an American doctor.

24:57.781 --> 25:00.782
Why are you here?

25:00.784 --> 25:02.784
This used to be
 my home.

25:02.786 --> 25:04.819
You were born here.

25:04.821 --> 25:06.888
Born and raised.

25:06.890 --> 25:09.024
And why did you leave
in the first place?

25:13.897 --> 25:18.400
Now, that's, um...
that's a long story.

25:18.402 --> 25:20.201
But you came back.

25:20.203 --> 25:21.669
Yeah.

25:21.671 --> 25:24.672
Why?

25:24.674 --> 25:26.808
To try and help my family.

25:26.810 --> 25:29.878
Try and do some good.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.147
But... [sighs]

25:34.051 --> 25:37.285
But what?!

25:40.590 --> 25:43.425
But being in this place forces
you to kill or be killed.

25:43.427 --> 25:46.895
Doesn't it?

25:50.934 --> 25:53.494
I don't want to live
like that anymore.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.660
[vehicle approaching]

26:13.757 --> 26:16.091
We walk from here.
[engine shuts off]

26:21.731 --> 26:24.299
How far?

26:24.301 --> 26:27.635
I'd say three
 or four miles.

26:29.773 --> 26:31.272
Do we really still
 need the gun?

26:31.274 --> 26:33.141
I'm not gonna hurt you.

26:33.143 --> 26:34.642
Yeah, people usually
tell me that

26:34.644 --> 26:37.204
when they're about to
do something to me.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.580
[wind gusting]

26:41.585 --> 26:44.285
Where in America?

26:44.287 --> 26:46.621
That you're... from?

26:49.493 --> 26:52.093
Pasadena.

26:52.095 --> 26:54.362
Where's home for you?

26:57.334 --> 26:58.466
All right.

26:58.468 --> 27:00.301
Chicago.

27:00.303 --> 27:02.804
Deerfield Park.

27:02.806 --> 27:05.173
Never really felt like home.

27:07.611 --> 27:10.245
A lot of kids
don't feel like they belong

27:10.247 --> 27:11.679
where they are.

27:11.681 --> 27:15.483
A lot of kids aren't Muslims
from Deerfield Park.

27:15.485 --> 27:18.119
Yeah, but there's plenty of
Muslims from Deerfield Park

27:18.121 --> 27:20.021
that don't run off
and join the Caliphate.

27:20.023 --> 27:21.156
Yeah, they deny
 who they are.

27:21.158 --> 27:24.359
And pretend like
 America's home.

27:24.361 --> 27:26.961
But not you, huh?

27:26.963 --> 27:28.630
What about your family?
They must miss you...

27:28.632 --> 27:30.198
Enough, enough talking.

27:33.170 --> 27:35.603
Shit!
[gun clatters on ground]

27:35.605 --> 27:37.672
[gasps]

27:38.975 --> 27:41.242
Oh, God! It's okay.

27:42.612 --> 27:46.047
It's okay.

27:46.049 --> 27:48.383
Let me see. [clears throat]

27:50.353 --> 27:52.720
I'm a doctor, remember?

27:54.720 --> 27:56.726
[Jill whimpering]

27:56.726 --> 27:58.326
Hopefully
 it's just a sprain,

27:58.328 --> 28:00.728
but either way
I'm gonna need to wrap it.

28:00.730 --> 28:03.464
Well, if you can
take baby steps,

28:03.466 --> 28:06.401
then hopefully we can get
to the Bedouin and they'll have

28:06.403 --> 28:08.236
a... a car
 or a camel.

28:08.238 --> 28:10.171
- [Jill groans]
- Otherwise,

28:10.173 --> 28:12.207
I'm gonna have to carry you
across the border.

28:12.209 --> 28:14.242
You're not leaving me?

28:14.244 --> 28:17.078
Put your hand
across my shoulder.

28:19.549 --> 28:25.420
Okay, let me get
you in some shade.

28:25.422 --> 28:27.422
[Ihab] <i>Oh, you should
 see the size</i>

28:27.424 --> 28:28.856
of our army now, Samira.

28:28.858 --> 28:30.358
This is an amazing
 thing to see.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.759
You were right, you were right.

28:31.761 --> 28:33.228
This is the way.

28:33.230 --> 28:35.263
This is how we will
take down these Al Fayeeds.

28:35.265 --> 28:37.265
This is how we will
take back our country.

28:37.267 --> 28:39.901
This is the way, Samira.

28:39.903 --> 28:43.638
So... I'll see you soon
in Ma'an, yes?

28:46.770 --> 28:48.778
[inhaling and exhaling]

28:48.778 --> 28:51.446
Keep an eye on your brother.

28:51.448 --> 28:55.283
I'm depending on you.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.280
[Ahmos sighs deeply]

29:10.433 --> 29:13.134
Keep an eye
 on your brother.

29:13.136 --> 29:15.770
I'm depending on you.

29:25.448 --> 29:28.116
[Abu Omar] You must be proud
of your big brothers.

29:28.118 --> 29:30.051
You should be.

29:30.053 --> 29:32.920
They are going to be
part of something very great.

29:32.922 --> 29:34.322
Something heroic.

29:34.324 --> 29:37.392
I'd bet you'd like
to be a part of it, huh?

29:37.394 --> 29:43.464
I could teach you the
craft of the knife.

29:44.467 --> 29:46.768
Would you like
 to hold it?

29:46.770 --> 29:49.330
[gasps] Ghani... no.

29:54.110 --> 29:57.645
If you want her, take her.

29:57.647 --> 30:01.215
I saw the way you looked at
her when you spared her life.

30:02.585 --> 30:05.353
I see the way you
look at her now.

30:07.590 --> 30:09.324
No.

30:09.326 --> 30:10.958

[explosions rumbling]

30:13.561 --> 30:17.560
[people chatting indistinctly]

30:18.501 --> 30:20.168
They're trying to take
out the main road.

30:20.170 --> 30:22.503
Take cover.
My men know what to do.

30:22.505 --> 30:25.239

30:25.239 --> 30:28.230

31:17.492 --> 31:18.928
[men laughing]

31:18.928 --> 31:20.928
Did the missiles damage
the road?

31:20.930 --> 31:23.770
[radio operator] Not enough
to keep us from passing.

31:23.770 --> 31:27.770
[cheering continues]

31:36.380 --> 31:38.381
[men speaking indistinctly]

31:38.381 --> 31:40.148
Come.

31:45.422 --> 31:47.588
Invite her to join us.

31:47.590 --> 31:49.390
[Daliyah] No.

31:49.392 --> 31:51.626
I beg of you, no, no.

31:51.628 --> 31:53.394
No! Ghani!

31:53.396 --> 31:54.629
- Ommah!
- Ghani!

31:54.631 --> 31:56.230
- Ommah!
- [Nasrin] What kind of Muslim

31:56.232 --> 31:57.632
steals a wife from
 her husband?

31:57.634 --> 32:00.268
A mother
 from her child?

32:00.270 --> 32:02.637
You have already taken
two of my sons.

32:02.639 --> 32:04.439
- [Daliyah] Ghani! Ghani!
- Ommah!

32:04.441 --> 32:05.640
No.

32:12.415 --> 32:14.482
[indistinct P.A. announcements]

32:14.482 --> 32:17.480
[keyboard clacking]

32:24.494 --> 32:26.127
[Jamal] Over the next
few hours and days,

32:26.129 --> 32:28.596
- Mom?
- [Jamal] you will hear propaganda

32:28.598 --> 32:30.998
from the so-called
Army of the Caliphate.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.569
These are lies meant
to provoke fear.

32:34.571 --> 32:37.338
Our forces have already
begun deploying

32:37.340 --> 32:39.273
from our base in Ma'an
to defend that city,

32:39.275 --> 32:40.508
should it come
 under attack.

32:40.510 --> 32:41.742
We're under attack?

32:41.744 --> 32:44.078
Ma'an is...

32:44.080 --> 32:46.447
across the country,
a couple hours by air.

32:46.449 --> 32:48.082
Jesus.

32:48.084 --> 32:50.084
[sighs] We'll go
 to the hotel.

32:50.086 --> 32:52.553
I can call the state department
and find out what's going on.

32:54.357 --> 32:56.657
- We're okay for now.
- [Jamal's speech continues in background]

32:56.659 --> 33:00.120
Timmons, do you mind
 finding us a car? I just want

33:00.120 --> 33:01.630
to call Emma make sure
 she's not freaking out.

33:01.630 --> 33:02.960
- [James] Yeah.
- [Molly] Thank you.

33:02.960 --> 33:05.032
Uh, Abdul, it's Sammy.

33:05.034 --> 33:07.134
Um, you're not gonna
 believe it,

33:07.136 --> 33:08.669
but I just landed
 in Abuddin.

33:08.671 --> 33:10.671
Saw what was
 happening in Ma'an.

33:10.673 --> 33:12.974
Just give me a call,
make sure you're okay.

33:12.976 --> 33:14.876
Who was that?

33:14.878 --> 33:16.544
Um...

33:16.546 --> 33:19.113
a friend who's looking
for work in Ma'an.

33:19.115 --> 33:20.781
Making sure he's all right.

33:20.783 --> 33:23.117
I didn't know you kept up
with anyone from Abuddin.

33:23.119 --> 33:25.653
Just this one guy
from... from before.

33:25.655 --> 33:29.624
A friend as in...

33:30.527 --> 33:33.794
A friend as in I'm just
worried about him.

33:33.796 --> 33:37.064
[softly] All right.

33:37.066 --> 33:38.900
[Jamal] ...that the terrorist,
 Ihab Rashid,

33:38.902 --> 33:41.636
has joined forces

33:41.638 --> 33:43.371
with these foreigners
 tells you

33:43.373 --> 33:45.740
how desperate
 he is to lay claim

33:45.742 --> 33:48.576
to a country whose people
have rejected him.

33:48.578 --> 33:49.977
But be assured,

33:49.979 --> 33:53.648
these foreign invaders
will be destroyed

33:53.650 --> 33:57.351
by the full might
of our military forces.

33:57.353 --> 34:01.389
Although we continue to strive
for a peaceful Abuddin,

34:01.391 --> 34:04.892
we are unafraid to use
whatever force is necessary

34:04.894 --> 34:06.661
to keep Abuddin united.

34:06.663 --> 34:10.231
Our resolve to defend
our country

34:10.233 --> 34:14.235
is as unshakable
as our faith in God.

34:14.235 --> 34:16.105
[camera shutter clicks]

34:16.105 --> 34:18.572
Thank you.

34:19.708 --> 34:20.942
The plans
 you asked me

34:20.944 --> 34:23.244
to give the
 Chinese ambassador

34:23.246 --> 34:26.112
to evacuate their nationals
from Ma'an.

34:26.114 --> 34:28.516
But it won't come to that.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.620
I didn't think
it would come to this.

34:32.621 --> 34:35.623
We will stop them,
 I assure you.

34:35.625 --> 34:37.024
Like you assured me

34:37.025 --> 34:39.092
you would stop them
 in Tal Jiza?

34:42.031 --> 34:44.465
We underestimated
 their arsenal.

34:44.467 --> 34:47.134
You underestimated
many things, Uncle.

34:47.136 --> 34:50.371
So forgive me if I no longer
feel very assured

34:50.373 --> 34:52.672
by your assurances.

34:54.670 --> 34:57.380
[footsteps departing]

34:57.380 --> 34:59.714
[Leila] That was good.

34:59.716 --> 35:02.216
Now the world will finally
understand the difference

35:02.218 --> 35:05.720
between a so-called
freedom fighter

35:05.722 --> 35:07.421
and a bloody terrorist.

35:07.423 --> 35:10.491
[clears throat] He was right,
 after all, Leila.

35:10.493 --> 35:11.659
Who?

35:11.661 --> 35:13.461
Bassam, he was right.

35:13.463 --> 35:16.063
And I should have
listened to him.

35:17.266 --> 35:19.066
Right about what?

35:19.068 --> 35:21.235
About what was
 bound to happen,

35:21.237 --> 35:23.004
sooner or later.

35:23.006 --> 35:24.672
[sighs]

35:24.674 --> 35:27.808
He knew Ihab Rashid
would never let go.

35:27.810 --> 35:29.844
He kept warning me,
 and I...

35:29.846 --> 35:32.847
[chuckles] I killed him.

35:39.322 --> 35:40.855
Try and put
 some weight on it.

35:40.857 --> 35:42.490
All right?

35:42.492 --> 35:43.758
[winces] Oh.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.826
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

35:45.828 --> 35:47.461
All right, lean on me.

35:47.463 --> 35:50.031
We'll take it one step
at a time, okay?

35:50.033 --> 35:52.166

is straight ahead.

35:53.269 --> 35:54.835

35:58.841 --> 36:00.675
[Faisel] Get away
 from her.

36:07.850 --> 36:09.517
- You are hurt?
- I'm fine.

36:09.519 --> 36:11.585
Did he touch you?

36:13.122 --> 36:14.722
I want to hear
 you say it.

36:14.724 --> 36:16.791
No, he didn't touch me.

36:23.866 --> 36:25.900
Whoever you are,

36:25.902 --> 36:27.802
you must be insane
to take my wife

36:27.804 --> 36:29.804
and think you would
get away with it.

36:29.806 --> 36:32.506
[groans]
[body thuds]

36:32.508 --> 36:34.875
Did you think I
wouldn't come for her?

[groaning]

36:40.810 --> 36:42.819
[gasping]

36:42.819 --> 36:45.610
- [Bassam sobbing]
- Stop. He didn't take me.

36:45.610 --> 36:47.922
- [Bassam moaning]
- I went with him.

36:47.924 --> 36:50.491
Why are you lying
to protect him?

36:50.493 --> 36:53.461
I'm not.
 I am not lying.

36:54.897 --> 36:58.566
I made him take me to
get away from you.

36:58.568 --> 37:01.969
I would rather die
than go back with you.

37:01.969 --> 37:03.960

You all right?

37:40.875 --> 37:42.870
[Jill breaths heavily]

37:43.112 --> 37:44.912
Here.

37:44.914 --> 37:46.981
Take this.

37:50.987 --> 37:53.420
And show this
 to any Bedouin.

37:53.422 --> 37:54.922
They'll get you
across the border.

37:54.924 --> 37:56.123
And what about you?

37:56.125 --> 37:57.391
Aren't you coming 
with me?

37:58.594 --> 38:00.961
No.

38:02.064 --> 38:03.264
I don't understand.
You said that...

38:03.266 --> 38:05.132
I know what I said.

38:05.134 --> 38:07.201
I was wrong.

38:09.639 --> 38:12.940
These men have come
to destroy my country.

38:12.942 --> 38:15.810
I can't keep running anymore.

38:15.812 --> 38:17.912
But what will you do?

38:20.817 --> 38:23.017
Whatever God's will
allows me to do.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.926
Go home.
