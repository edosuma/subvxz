00:57.815 --> 00:58.479
Oi!

01:09.115 --> 01:10.481
You're nicked.

01:13.082 --> 01:14.548
Nice bit of artwork.

01:26.915 --> 01:29.412
Tim, what do you think
you were playing at,

01:29.414 --> 01:32.313
to be brought home
in a police car?

01:32.315 --> 01:33.380
Saved the bus fare.

01:33.382 --> 01:34.513
Don't you get smart with me.

01:34.515 --> 01:36.313
He can't be smart.

01:36.315 --> 01:37.181
He's an idiot.

01:37.183 --> 01:38.380
You be quiet.

01:38.382 --> 01:39.613
You're not helping.

01:43.216 --> 01:45.148
Oh, get that thing away!

01:45.150 --> 01:46.815
Mum, tell him!

01:47.083 --> 01:48.579
Don't listen to her, Monty.

01:48.581 --> 01:50.014
You'll hurt his feelings,

01:50.016 --> 01:52.380
and he will crawl into
your room at night.

01:52.382 --> 01:53.446
Enough.

01:53.448 --> 01:54.947
Shona, bed.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.481
We don't want you
exhausted for your big day.

02:03.282 --> 02:04.349
Well?

02:08.381 --> 02:10.280
Any explanation?

02:10.282 --> 02:11.181
What's the point?

02:11.183 --> 02:12.613
Right, that's it.

02:12.615 --> 02:14.047
You're going on that
school trip tomorrow.

02:14.049 --> 02:15.546
But you said you were
gonna write a note.

02:15.548 --> 02:16.814
And you said you
were going to bed

02:16.816 --> 02:18.847
and not gallivanting
'round the city.

02:18.849 --> 02:21.682
You never would have
done this before.

02:22.649 --> 02:26.883
Just once, I wish you'd
think of the rest of us.

02:28.116 --> 02:32.348
What you do affects everybody.

02:55.049 --> 02:58.747
Seems like boys turn
from gentle Jekyll

02:58.749 --> 03:02.150
to Mr. Hyde like
they're switching sides.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.883
Do you have to do that?

03:04.649 --> 03:05.781
We're supposed to know it.

03:05.783 --> 03:07.616
Yeah, well, learn it silently.

03:09.315 --> 03:11.680
Like Two Face,
this new face I see

03:11.682 --> 03:13.514
on the flip side I
don't recognize...

03:13.516 --> 03:14.881
How can you not know it?

03:14.883 --> 03:16.749
I've heard it so
much, even I know it.

03:18.049 --> 03:19.981
Seriously, look, you
don't need to worry

03:19.983 --> 03:21.413
about the poetry comp.

03:21.415 --> 03:22.949
Yeah, you'll be crap anyway.

03:24.749 --> 03:25.781
Tim!

03:25.783 --> 03:27.050
What?

03:30.382 --> 03:31.482
Hey, Monty.

03:37.682 --> 03:38.814
Come on, love.

03:38.816 --> 03:40.682
Ignore him.
You'll be fine.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.380
Why does he
have to be such a dick?

03:43.382 --> 03:44.816
It's a boy thing.

03:49.017 --> 03:50.215
Tim, we're going.

03:50.217 --> 03:51.449
I'll get my folder.

03:59.549 --> 04:01.616
I've got to mow Mr. Nash's lawn.

04:02.582 --> 04:04.249
The Clements at
48 need the trees

04:04.251 --> 04:05.680
in their backyard cut down,

04:05.682 --> 04:08.082
but I'll be out after,
straight after that.

04:08.084 --> 04:09.982
Yeah, but please
don't be late, Mum.

04:09.984 --> 04:10.848
I won't.

04:23.282 --> 04:24.349
Tim.

04:29.017 --> 04:31.717
Willow has been
rehearsing all night.

04:32.550 --> 04:34.248
She is so gonna beat you, Shona.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.548
Yeah, well, for
your information,

04:35.550 --> 04:37.017
I've been up all night too.

04:39.817 --> 04:41.884
Have fun at the museum, losers.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.617
So, what does she mean?

04:45.817 --> 04:48.381
Thought you were
bunking the snoozeum.

04:48.383 --> 04:50.381
Slight change to
the old schedule.

04:50.383 --> 04:51.414
So you've got to go.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.381
And why are you laughing?

04:52.383 --> 04:53.483
You've gotta go too.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.650
At least we'll all
suffer together, though.

04:56.017 --> 04:58.683
Alright, silver
lining, check it.

04:59.817 --> 05:02.784
You are not gonna spray in
the Natural History Museum.

05:03.617 --> 05:04.848
But we don't know the
security arrangements.

05:04.850 --> 05:06.515
We don't know how many cameras.

05:06.517 --> 05:08.815
There's an infinite
number of variables

05:08.817 --> 05:10.381
which need to be
taken into account.

05:10.383 --> 05:11.448
It's okay, Alf.

05:11.450 --> 05:12.982
We don't need a risk assessment.

05:12.984 --> 05:13.982
It's exciting, isn't it?

05:13.984 --> 05:15.817
And silver lining two.

05:17.450 --> 05:18.414
Wow.

05:18.416 --> 05:19.648
Yeah!

05:19.650 --> 05:21.048
Used by U.S. marines.

05:21.050 --> 05:22.150
It's got the brightest...

05:25.450 --> 05:27.717
Oh, of course

05:34.583 --> 05:36.049
It's Georgia.

05:36.051 --> 05:38.150
She's, like, about 28.

05:38.152 --> 05:39.882
17 in three months.

05:39.884 --> 05:40.615
Height?

05:40.617 --> 05:42.049
Five foot six.

05:42.051 --> 05:42.882
Bust?

05:42.884 --> 05:43.848
34C.

05:43.850 --> 05:44.515
Star sign?

05:44.517 --> 05:45.515
Aquarius.

05:45.517 --> 05:46.884
For pity's sake.

05:48.316 --> 05:50.314
So, uh, plan, on the coach,

05:50.316 --> 05:51.648
we hole up at the back?

05:51.650 --> 05:52.681
And play Toasters
versus Werewolves

05:52.683 --> 05:54.281
where no one can see us.

05:54.283 --> 05:55.316
Classic.

05:55.517 --> 05:56.883
If you wanna slack
off and chillax,

05:56.885 --> 05:59.350
do it on your own
time, eh, Timothy?

05:59.550 --> 06:00.717
Yes, miss.

06:00.918 --> 06:03.581
And Toasters
versus Werewolves?

06:03.583 --> 06:05.116
That is so year six.

06:05.118 --> 06:08.517
You wanna be playing
Misogynist Air Strike Three.

06:10.018 --> 06:10.916
Oh.

06:17.718 --> 06:19.851
And she's our responsible adult.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.716
Mr. Thompson.

06:23.718 --> 06:25.783
Mr. David Thompson.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.783
Sir, if you don't open the door,

06:27.785 --> 06:29.851
we'll be back with
a court order.

06:31.018 --> 06:32.117
Mr. Thompson.

06:32.885 --> 06:34.517
I know he's in there.
I can see him.

06:39.551 --> 06:41.716
Who was that, Daddy?

06:41.718 --> 06:42.618
Shh.

06:44.718 --> 06:47.983
Didn't I say that
if you had the day off sick,

06:47.985 --> 06:49.716
then you could not
get in the way?

06:49.718 --> 06:52.584
Now, Daddy has a very
important day today, shh.

06:53.184 --> 06:54.716
Can I make cereal?

06:54.718 --> 06:56.482
Why don't you
have some toast, love?

06:56.484 --> 06:58.314
We don't have
cereal, do we?

06:58.316 --> 06:59.384
Fine!

07:17.218 --> 07:18.282
Hey, how you doing?

07:18.284 --> 07:19.415
My name is Mr. Lewis Groad.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.451
You can call me Mr. Lewis Groad.

07:24.051 --> 07:25.250
No, hang on.

07:25.252 --> 07:27.250
My name is Bond, James Bond.

07:27.252 --> 07:28.018
You can... okay.

07:29.118 --> 07:30.082
Hi, how you doing?

07:30.084 --> 07:31.551
My name is James.

07:33.417 --> 07:34.482
Hey, how you doing?

07:34.484 --> 07:35.582
My name is Mr. Lewis Groad.

07:35.584 --> 07:37.349
You can call me Lewis Groad.

07:37.351 --> 07:38.682
Mr. Lewis, oh, Jesus.

07:38.684 --> 07:39.682
Come on, Bond.

07:39.684 --> 07:40.783
I'm Bond, James Bond.

07:40.785 --> 07:42.518
You can call me James Bond.

07:47.085 --> 07:48.351
Soon be time.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.351
I bet we're both
thinking the same thing.

07:53.518 --> 07:56.150
How many sausages can
I fit in my mouth?

07:56.152 --> 07:57.382
What? No.

07:57.384 --> 07:58.449
Oh.

07:58.451 --> 07:59.682
This could be the big story

07:59.684 --> 08:00.952
that saves our
skins at the paper.

08:02.252 --> 08:03.349
Do you want a...

08:03.351 --> 08:04.415
Yeah, go on, then.

08:08.417 --> 08:09.451
Ah.

08:10.252 --> 08:13.216
Look what you've done.

08:13.218 --> 08:14.518
Sorry, sorry.

08:15.919 --> 08:17.584
- Stop it!
- Are you alright, though?

08:18.118 --> 08:20.282
- What do you think?
- Whoa!

08:22.351 --> 08:23.584
Look at me.

08:26.952 --> 08:29.984
And the Diplodocus,
also known as Dippy,

08:29.986 --> 08:31.650
is, of course, extinct.

08:31.652 --> 08:33.750
This great hall was
bequeathed to the museum

08:33.751 --> 08:37.650
by a rich philanthropist
who wanted to be remembered.

08:37.652 --> 08:39.852
Gather round, gather round.

08:41.251 --> 08:42.784
Any questions?

08:42.785 --> 08:44.619
If you can tear yourselves
away from your phones.

08:47.085 --> 08:48.950
"That's interesting,
Miss Halliday.

08:48.952 --> 08:51.950
"You've made me want to work
with fossils, Miss Halliday.

08:51.952 --> 08:53.983
"Thanks for being
so knowledgeable,"

08:53.985 --> 08:57.416
or even, "That's a nice
blouse, Miss Halliday."

08:57.418 --> 08:58.850
Just give me something.

08:58.852 --> 09:01.483
My therapist says it's
great for my self-esteem

09:01.485 --> 09:03.352
to get positive validation.

09:05.284 --> 09:07.018
Over sharing again, Rachel.

09:11.352 --> 09:12.949
Maybe we should go back.

09:12.951 --> 09:14.285
What do you think?

09:15.786 --> 09:17.450
This must go deep under London.

09:27.786 --> 09:29.585
This is so gross.

09:30.219 --> 09:32.251
Are they dead?

09:32.253 --> 09:33.318
Whoa.

09:41.519 --> 09:42.916
Maybe we
should just crash

09:42.918 --> 09:45.019
your sister's slam poem
thing at the school.

09:47.385 --> 09:48.418
Why?

09:49.119 --> 09:50.685
It's like she's here already.

09:51.485 --> 09:52.383
Mean.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.583
The chances of this working
out in our favor are very slim.

10:05.585 --> 10:07.184
I'm just saying.

10:07.186 --> 10:08.485
Come on.

10:17.052 --> 10:18.719
This is way too spooky.

10:21.585 --> 10:23.350
Freaked out now.

10:23.352 --> 10:25.117
We could actually be trespassing

10:25.119 --> 10:27.650
on London Underground
property now.

10:27.652 --> 10:30.283
We are like 100 miles
away from the museum.

10:30.285 --> 10:32.585
Oh, Alf,
stop wittering.

10:34.787 --> 10:36.517
Wow, that's one of
those marine ones.

10:36.519 --> 10:37.886
You never said you had that.

10:38.385 --> 10:41.153
Ow, what was that for?

10:53.452 --> 10:55.251
I don't like this.

10:55.253 --> 10:57.017
I don't like this at all.

10:57.019 --> 10:57.984
We're lost.

10:57.986 --> 10:59.316
We're definitely lost.

10:59.318 --> 11:01.383
It's fine, Alf.

11:01.385 --> 11:03.285
Listen.

11:03.787 --> 11:05.785
That does not sound good.

11:19.852 --> 11:20.718
Guys!

11:26.753 --> 11:28.185
- Who was...
- No idea.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.484
I'm not gonna ask.

11:29.486 --> 11:30.620
I'm scared.

11:32.686 --> 11:33.753
Here...

11:35.653 --> 11:37.019
Let's get out of here.

11:52.453 --> 11:53.686
Ladies and gentlemen.

11:56.220 --> 11:57.353
Pay attention.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.651
This number will become
relevant in a moment,

12:01.653 --> 12:03.920
so please remember it.

12:04.886 --> 12:08.317
Please meet, from New York,
my sponsor, Mr. Lewis Groad,

12:08.319 --> 12:12.384
the billionaire who has funded
my revolutionary research.

12:12.386 --> 12:13.918
And the light refreshments.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.651
Well, that's three
canapes per person.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.252
Although there seems
to be quite a few,

12:18.254 --> 12:22.020
so maybe make that two
canapes per person.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.018
I must ask for there
to be no photographs.

12:25.020 --> 12:26.951
We don't wanna see any
of this making its way

12:26.953 --> 12:28.085
onto the internet.

12:28.087 --> 12:29.185
You understand?

12:29.187 --> 12:30.118
If I see a camera or a phone,

12:30.120 --> 12:30.985
I'm gonna kill you.

12:30.987 --> 12:31.751
Metaphorically.

12:31.753 --> 12:33.218
No, no, no, I mean it.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.220
I'm gonna kill you.

12:35.187 --> 12:37.051
No, seriously, folks,
a real pleasure to say,

12:37.053 --> 12:39.687
hi, how you doing, y'all,
from New York City.

12:39.887 --> 12:43.652
Ladies and gentlemen, in life,

12:43.654 --> 12:45.818
what is the one question

12:45.820 --> 12:48.419
that every person
wants answering?

12:49.187 --> 12:50.654
Uh, what time's lunch?

12:51.554 --> 12:52.619
I was looking for something

12:52.621 --> 12:54.286
a little more philosophical.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.621
What <i>is</i> lunch?

12:57.319 --> 12:58.787
A little more?

12:59.187 --> 13:00.585
Does lunch exist?

13:00.587 --> 13:02.284
It's nothing to do with lunch.

13:02.286 --> 13:03.317
Forget lunch.

13:03.319 --> 13:05.152
Lunch is not part of this.

13:05.154 --> 13:07.853
No, as the years fly by,

13:08.654 --> 13:11.485
one question starts
to take precedence,

13:11.487 --> 13:16.286
the question, "how
long do I have left?"

13:17.254 --> 13:20.521
What if you could find out?

13:22.920 --> 13:23.787
Now...

13:25.220 --> 13:26.255
...you can.

13:27.753 --> 13:29.652
What I'm going
to show you today

13:29.654 --> 13:32.118
is a breakthrough in
scientific technology,

13:32.120 --> 13:35.619
something that has never
ever been done before,

13:35.621 --> 13:36.652
something mankind has dreamed

13:36.654 --> 13:38.885
of for thousands of years.

13:38.887 --> 13:42.153
This is the culmination
of my life's work,

13:42.155 --> 13:44.820
30 years of hard research.

13:45.787 --> 13:51.287
Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you the Vitalitron.

13:53.155 --> 13:55.352
Welcome to
the Vitalitron capsule,

13:55.354 --> 13:57.119
providing the
authoritative analysis

13:57.121 --> 13:59.887
and prediction of Earth
based organic matter.

14:03.054 --> 14:07.418
It can predict the longevity
of any living creature.

14:07.420 --> 14:10.153
It assesses over 30 parameters,

14:10.155 --> 14:13.818
weight, height, cellular
age, metabolic rate,

14:13.820 --> 14:15.253
blood pressure, et cetera.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.385
Full details are
in the leaflets,

14:18.387 --> 14:21.819
and then it makes
an exact prediction

14:21.821 --> 14:25.052
of the time of death
of that organism,

14:25.054 --> 14:28.287
and now a demonstration.

14:30.788 --> 14:32.986
When we started
this presentation,

14:32.988 --> 14:36.021
it had four minutes
left to live.

14:37.454 --> 14:39.086
Critical
organ failure

14:39.088 --> 14:42.385
expected in 10 seconds.

14:44.921 --> 14:47.654
Three, two, one,

14:50.387 --> 14:52.719
and life form is extinct.

14:52.721 --> 14:54.685
Predicted to the
second.

14:54.687 --> 14:57.119
Confirmation
of major organ failure.

14:57.121 --> 14:58.520
No pulse detected.

14:58.522 --> 15:02.119
Time of death
confirmed at 12:14 P.M.

15:02.121 --> 15:03.553
Any questions?

15:03.555 --> 15:05.453
Do you have any vol-au-vents?

15:05.455 --> 15:06.555
Not you.

15:07.455 --> 15:09.522
Have you ever tested
it on a human?

15:10.854 --> 15:14.088
That would be
unethical... apparently.

15:14.988 --> 15:17.555
Well, do you wanna test
it on my colleague?

15:18.188 --> 15:19.153
What?

15:19.155 --> 15:20.219
I am not testing it...

15:20.221 --> 15:21.386
No, no, test him, my colleague.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.086
I am not testing it on anyone.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.553
Well, I'll do it if he does it.

15:25.555 --> 15:26.621
See, we can do it together.

15:27.054 --> 15:28.587
How would that even work?

15:29.555 --> 15:31.355
He could sit on my lap?

15:31.555 --> 15:35.021
It will only take one
reading at a time.

15:36.054 --> 15:40.520
Now might be a good time
to explore the buffet.

15:49.854 --> 15:50.719
Yes.

16:01.888 --> 16:05.786
Let's say goodbye to Mr. David

16:05.788 --> 16:08.453
"Oh, look at how much
money you owe us.

16:08.455 --> 16:15.455
"You're a pathetic human being
and a bad father," Thompson,

16:16.089 --> 16:19.852
and then say, well,
hello there, Mr. Lewis,

16:19.854 --> 16:22.419
"Welcome to my dick
dickety doo dah

16:22.421 --> 16:24.519
"private members' drinking club

16:24.521 --> 16:26.654
"in downtown New
York City," Groad.

16:44.388 --> 16:45.552
You are not serious.

16:45.554 --> 16:47.022
Come on, man.

16:47.222 --> 16:48.120
I'm not turning it on.

16:48.122 --> 16:49.585
Just get out now.

16:49.587 --> 16:51.519
You can't know when
you're gonna die.

16:51.521 --> 16:52.386
What does it matter?

16:52.388 --> 16:53.722
Just press it.

16:57.655 --> 17:00.286
All systems are go.

17:00.288 --> 17:01.620
Building jigawatt battery.

17:01.622 --> 17:02.686
It might microwave him.

17:02.688 --> 17:03.920
We are transferring

17:03.922 --> 17:06.386
from grid power to
battery reserve.

17:09.454 --> 17:12.253
Calculating weight
and cellular age.

17:12.256 --> 17:13.421
What on earth?

17:14.789 --> 17:17.320
He should not
be in there.

17:23.156 --> 17:24.520
Yep?

17:24.521 --> 17:25.586
We've got a situation
here, Mr. Groad.

17:25.588 --> 17:27.888
Someone's inside the Vitalitron.

17:28.189 --> 17:29.688
How did that happen, Lena?

17:30.655 --> 17:32.722
Did you leave the
machine switched on?

17:33.789 --> 17:35.920
Cell analysis
data now complete.

17:35.922 --> 17:39.022
DNA molecule match
now in progress.

17:42.822 --> 17:47.389
Results due in three, two, one.

17:50.622 --> 17:52.389
Oh, my word.

17:56.090 --> 17:57.722
Well, how long have I got, then?

18:07.322 --> 18:11.588
You've got two
hours left to live.

18:14.655 --> 18:17.822
Well, it's obviously... failed.

18:20.289 --> 18:21.822
That can't be right, can it?

18:24.090 --> 18:24.956
Guys.

18:28.956 --> 18:31.553
This is the conclusive
test that we've needed.

18:31.555 --> 18:32.988
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

18:32.990 --> 18:34.888
But does it predict
accidents, though?

18:34.890 --> 18:36.287
What if Tim walked under a bus

18:36.289 --> 18:37.386
before the two hours is up?

18:37.388 --> 18:38.522
I'm still here, thanks.

18:38.790 --> 18:40.320
I suppose I'm saying if
he had an accident now,

18:40.322 --> 18:43.121
would he linger and then
finally die in in two hours?

18:43.123 --> 18:44.054
Really?

18:44.056 --> 18:45.320
If he goes under a bus,

18:45.322 --> 18:46.255
he dies sooner
than in two hours.

18:46.257 --> 18:47.653
He's not indestructible.

18:47.655 --> 18:52.588
Lena, how are the
calculations looking?

18:53.223 --> 18:56.788
The temporal calculations
seem accurate, Mr. Groad.

18:56.790 --> 18:59.988
Looks like we'll soon have
the ultimate validation.

18:59.990 --> 19:00.890
Fantastic.

19:01.090 --> 19:02.155
Fantastic?

19:02.157 --> 19:03.654
If it's true, Tim will be dead.

19:03.656 --> 19:08.255
Ah, sure, okay,
that was very crass

19:08.257 --> 19:09.255
and very insensitive of me,

19:09.257 --> 19:11.954
and for that I, hey.

19:11.956 --> 19:13.188
Hey, wait a minute.

19:13.190 --> 19:14.756
What are you guys doing here?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.521
School trip to the museum?

19:18.523 --> 19:19.990
This ain't no museum.

19:21.257 --> 19:24.289
We went on a bit of a wander.

19:24.523 --> 19:27.554
Hey, hey, hey, where you going?

19:27.556 --> 19:29.188
Lena. Lena!

19:29.190 --> 19:30.420
This is epic.

19:30.422 --> 19:31.921
And it's vital you
kids stay here,

19:31.923 --> 19:33.420
as I need to monitor
your progress

19:33.422 --> 19:34.523
over the course of
the next two...

19:34.890 --> 19:37.157
...hours.

19:37.356 --> 19:38.387
Stop them.

19:38.389 --> 19:40.422
Hey, you, you, stop them!

19:40.723 --> 19:43.420
I will pay you $100,000
each to catch them.

19:56.356 --> 19:57.422
Hey, this way.

20:08.489 --> 20:09.623
Keep up.

20:12.656 --> 20:14.122
What do we
do when we catch them?

20:14.124 --> 20:16.589
I don't know,
but I want that money.

20:18.422 --> 20:20.222
They're just out
through that hatch.

20:22.024 --> 20:23.387
God dang.

20:30.356 --> 20:32.556
I think
I broke my coccyx.

20:33.289 --> 20:34.258
Shut up.

20:35.158 --> 20:38.587
This could be the ultimate
test of the machine,

20:38.589 --> 20:39.822
but the boy has gone rogue.

20:39.824 --> 20:42.521
Now, we need to get him back.

20:42.523 --> 20:44.654
You understand me?

20:44.656 --> 20:48.089
Lena, those idiots
better find him, Lena,

20:48.091 --> 20:50.287
'cause if he does
not die as predicted,

20:50.289 --> 20:51.755
then it is the end
of the funding.

20:51.757 --> 20:53.487
It will be the end of you.

20:53.489 --> 20:54.855
Nobody is gonna buy this machine

20:54.857 --> 20:57.122
if it is not correct
100% of the time.

20:57.124 --> 20:58.487
It will be.

20:58.489 --> 21:01.022
And if it is not correct
100% of the time,

21:01.024 --> 21:03.554
then its use as a
diagnostic tool...

21:08.389 --> 21:10.122
Do you understand me?

21:10.124 --> 21:11.523
Is he going to die?

21:21.289 --> 21:23.055
And you're sure
you don't feel ill?

21:23.057 --> 21:25.091
You know, it's
not gonna be true.

21:25.524 --> 21:27.387
Well, the Victorians
had parlor tricks

21:27.389 --> 21:28.388
where they'd summon the dead,

21:28.390 --> 21:29.255
but it was just that.

21:29.257 --> 21:30.289
It was a trick.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.722
That was a real
press conference.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.655
She was a real scientist.

21:34.657 --> 21:36.091
That thing was real.

21:36.322 --> 21:37.855
You need to tell your mum.

21:37.857 --> 21:39.355
Oh, great idea.

21:39.357 --> 21:40.357
She'll just think I'm lying
to get out of the school trip.

21:40.657 --> 21:41.957
So what are you gonna do?

21:42.257 --> 21:43.357
What do you mean?

21:43.624 --> 21:45.221
Well, you can't just do
nothing for two hours.

21:45.223 --> 21:47.522
It'd be just like every
other two hours of your life.

21:47.524 --> 21:49.122
Oh, great,

21:49.124 --> 21:50.755
so mum says I'm selfish,
now you're saying I'm lazy.

21:50.757 --> 21:53.922
Do stuff, stuff you've
always wanted to do.

21:53.924 --> 21:55.789
That way, even if
the machine's wrong,

21:55.791 --> 21:58.157
you still get to do
some great things.

21:58.159 --> 21:59.256
What have you got to...

22:03.390 --> 22:04.490
...lose?

22:05.757 --> 22:07.690
Please tell me I'm not the
only one who can see that.

22:08.724 --> 22:10.157
Course we can see him.

22:10.159 --> 22:11.824
If you want a
photo, it's 10 quid.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.957
Maybe I should be
thinking of something.

22:20.657 --> 22:22.488
Is that a no?

22:22.490 --> 22:23.555
Charming.

22:30.191 --> 22:31.321
Get me out.

22:31.323 --> 22:32.791
Come on, mate.

22:41.191 --> 22:42.025
Come on.

22:48.224 --> 22:49.823
I can't face it.

22:49.825 --> 22:51.756
I really don't wanna go to
my auntie's this morning,

22:51.758 --> 22:52.323
not now.

22:52.892 --> 22:54.655
Why do you need
to see your aunt?

22:54.657 --> 22:56.825
Oh, I left my science homework
book at hers last night.

22:57.892 --> 23:00.290
Why do you need to do
your science homework?

23:02.557 --> 23:04.256
I'm just saying.

23:04.258 --> 23:05.355
That's a bit harsh.

23:05.357 --> 23:06.455
Nothing's gonna happen to him.

23:06.457 --> 23:08.056
Thanks for the support, guys.

23:08.058 --> 23:09.355
Look, can one of you just
go and knock on the door?

23:09.357 --> 23:11.023
She lives right here.

23:11.025 --> 23:13.689
Just tell her I told you to
pick up the green science book.

23:13.691 --> 23:15.357
It's on the kitchen table.

23:16.290 --> 23:17.321
Right, okay, I'll go.

23:17.323 --> 23:18.923
I feel bad now.

23:18.925 --> 23:19.689
Thanks, Vic.

23:19.691 --> 23:20.756
You're a true friend.

23:20.758 --> 23:21.823
We're just gonna wait down here

23:21.825 --> 23:23.222
so she doesn't notice I'm here.

23:23.224 --> 23:24.525
Okay.

23:33.458 --> 23:36.323
Oh, sorry, wrong house.

23:46.224 --> 23:47.691
That's not funny.

23:49.191 --> 23:50.291
Yes, it is.

24:00.591 --> 24:03.257
Guys, I know what we can do.

24:03.259 --> 24:04.456
Bucket list.

24:04.458 --> 24:05.691
What's going on it?

24:06.925 --> 24:08.558
Break into Gamer Shed
and nick some games.

24:08.958 --> 24:11.025
When will you have
time to play them?

24:12.291 --> 24:13.491
If you die.

24:13.825 --> 24:15.389
Yeah, and it can't be
anything illegal, anyway,

24:15.391 --> 24:17.025
'cause we're still
around to take the rap.

24:18.159 --> 24:19.556
<i>If</i> you die.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.024
What is the point of
doing a bucket list

24:21.026 --> 24:22.823
if you can't do
cool, illegal stuff?

24:22.825 --> 24:25.024
Well, you don't have
to do anything illegal.

24:25.026 --> 24:27.358
There must be other things
you've always wanted to do.

24:33.825 --> 24:35.257
I don't mean to rush you, but...

24:35.259 --> 24:38.893
Okay, drive with Lewis Hamilton.

24:40.125 --> 24:43.356
Yeah, okay, probably
a bit hard to arrange

24:43.358 --> 24:44.558
in two hours though.

24:45.092 --> 24:45.926
94 minutes.

24:46.458 --> 24:47.491
Alf.

24:49.324 --> 24:51.891
Okay, let's just
park Lewis Hamilton,

24:51.893 --> 24:55.859
and say, how about
having a drive with...

24:56.558 --> 24:57.591
...with my dad?

24:59.658 --> 25:01.826
Would he be dressed
as Lewis Hamilton?

25:02.759 --> 25:04.959
Would you like him to be?

25:08.458 --> 25:09.626
Okay, um...

25:10.992 --> 25:11.959
climb a mountain.

25:12.926 --> 25:14.223
Better.

25:14.225 --> 25:16.992
Not many mountains in this
part of London, though.

25:24.759 --> 25:25.626
Hi.

25:27.324 --> 25:28.389
I'm fine.

25:29.358 --> 25:31.023
Nervous, but I'm fine.

25:31.025 --> 25:34.592
Yeah, I know, brave
and heart and all that.

25:36.025 --> 25:36.893
See you later.

25:38.526 --> 25:40.459
You will be on time?

25:42.259 --> 25:43.392
Won't you?

25:51.958 --> 25:52.958
Okay.

25:53.626 --> 25:57.359
One, I wanna get over
my fear of heights.

26:00.526 --> 26:01.592
Write it.

26:05.125 --> 26:06.859
Fear of heights.

26:08.659 --> 26:11.992
Two, I wanna kiss a girl.

26:13.058 --> 26:14.023
Which girl?

26:14.025 --> 26:15.357
Oh, not just any girl.

26:15.359 --> 26:17.158
She's like a 10 on
the hotness scale,

26:17.160 --> 26:18.524
Georgia Miston.

26:18.526 --> 26:19.490
Georgia Miston?

26:19.492 --> 26:20.690
She's an 11, man.

26:20.692 --> 26:22.826
Beyond the scale, seismic.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.557
Good grief.

26:24.559 --> 26:26.757
Three, I wanna
throw up some graf.

26:26.759 --> 26:29.559
Number three,
throw up some graf.

26:32.193 --> 26:35.726
Four, I wanna be Steve McQueen

26:36.793 --> 26:39.492
in that movie where he
rides that motorbike.

26:40.392 --> 26:41.793
Put "ride a motorbike."

26:42.559 --> 26:43.824
Motorbike.

26:43.826 --> 26:44.924
Vroom.

26:45.893 --> 26:47.124
Done.

26:49.126 --> 26:50.026
You happy now?

26:59.893 --> 27:01.893
Bucket list, ah hah.

27:41.593 --> 27:43.359
That one.

27:48.660 --> 27:50.493
Just step on that ledge.

27:51.693 --> 27:54.160
It is theoretically
possible without dying.

27:54.393 --> 27:56.024
Alf.

27:56.026 --> 27:58.893
Yay, you can do it, man.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.591
There he is up there.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.792
He's gonna toss himself off.

28:04.794 --> 28:06.926
Slight problem, Mr. Groad.

28:07.959 --> 28:09.460
He's gonna kill himself.

28:11.293 --> 28:12.725
<i>Well, stop him.</i>

28:12.727 --> 28:14.159
They look like they're
trying to make him jump.

28:14.161 --> 28:15.691
What sort of friends are they?

28:15.693 --> 28:17.291
He wants him alive.

28:17.293 --> 28:18.360
Come on.

28:23.893 --> 28:24.926
Oh, go on.

28:33.527 --> 28:35.693
Remind me whose
bright idea this was.

28:36.826 --> 28:38.424
Sometimes you just
have to go for it

28:38.426 --> 28:41.027
and do the thing that
really scares you.

28:43.261 --> 28:44.458
It's fine.

28:44.460 --> 28:45.493
Look.

28:56.393 --> 28:57.493
Whoa.

29:00.094 --> 29:01.194
Hold it!

29:01.994 --> 29:04.525
What is it exactly
that you want from us?

29:04.527 --> 29:05.525
Calm down.

29:05.527 --> 29:06.925
Everyone calm down,

29:06.927 --> 29:08.927
and we can have a
nice cup of tea.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.792
Do young people still drink tea?

29:11.794 --> 29:12.892
You can have an orange squash

29:12.894 --> 29:15.925
in one of those carton things.

29:15.927 --> 29:19.659
Yeah, or perhaps, one of
those still, cloudy lemonades.

29:19.661 --> 29:21.827
I mean, they're very popular.

29:24.794 --> 29:27.561
Bottom line, we need you
to come back to the demo.

29:28.027 --> 29:29.127
Go away.

29:29.661 --> 29:31.324
Come back to the demo room,

29:31.326 --> 29:32.760
or I'll tell your mum.

29:36.360 --> 29:37.659
Hang on.

29:37.661 --> 29:38.858
That's made me
sound six years old.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.192
I'm not.

29:40.194 --> 29:42.360
I can drive and go out
with girls and everything.

29:45.528 --> 29:48.027
Does your mum know you've
got a time limit, Tim?

29:48.960 --> 29:49.825
Yeah.

29:52.060 --> 29:53.994
Well, you're a
bigger man than I am.

29:54.727 --> 29:56.526
I couldn't tell my
mum a thing like that,

29:56.528 --> 29:59.758
oh, see the look in her eyes.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.559
Didn't she plead to
be with you, Tim?

30:02.561 --> 30:06.292
Didn't she wanna spend
those last remaining...

30:06.294 --> 30:07.594
Okay, I'll come.

30:09.661 --> 30:12.027
I flunked the first
thing on the list anyway.

30:13.894 --> 30:14.559
Go on.

30:16.262 --> 30:17.060
Good boy.

30:18.027 --> 30:20.260
Well, that was easier
than I thought.

30:21.927 --> 30:22.691
Yeah.

30:22.693 --> 30:23.994
Run for it!

30:24.262 --> 30:25.126
Oi!

30:25.128 --> 30:26.292
What?

30:28.760 --> 30:31.925
No, of all the
underhanded, snide...

30:34.262 --> 30:35.892
How did they know
about the list?

30:35.894 --> 30:36.758
Who cares?

30:36.760 --> 30:38.392
I've gotta find Georgia Miston.

30:38.394 --> 30:39.660
72 minutes.

30:40.394 --> 30:42.392
Right, next on the
list, kiss a girl.

30:44.394 --> 30:45.294
Shut up.

30:50.727 --> 30:52.425
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

30:52.427 --> 30:55.260
Next time we grab the kid.

30:55.262 --> 30:57.026
Next time we'll just grab you.

30:57.028 --> 30:58.494
Hello, hi.

31:14.195 --> 31:15.826
Shona.

31:15.828 --> 31:17.526
When you see your brother,

31:17.528 --> 31:18.592
you tell him I was not
impressed that he went AWOL

31:18.594 --> 31:19.660
at the museum.

31:20.327 --> 31:22.095
Not coolio.

31:22.394 --> 31:24.228
No, Miss Forrest.

31:24.461 --> 31:25.659
Shouldn't you be coming in?

31:25.661 --> 31:26.859
You'll be on stage soon.

31:26.861 --> 31:29.260
- Are you excited?
- Nervous.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.661
That's the spirit.

31:53.327 --> 31:56.626
Organic life
form has exited the capsule.

31:56.628 --> 31:59.393
Unable to complete
monitoring analysis.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.993
This is most unusual.

32:03.995 --> 32:06.661
Connection to
online network lost.

32:23.163 --> 32:24.626
Look, don't worry.

32:24.628 --> 32:26.093
Just 'cause you
bottled one thing

32:26.095 --> 32:27.795
doesn't mean the other
stuff won't work out.

32:29.561 --> 32:31.094
Georgia's in there.

32:31.096 --> 32:32.360
The mammal
tour will be starting

32:32.362 --> 32:34.293
in the blue zone in 15 minutes.

32:36.761 --> 32:38.326
I didn't think it
would be this easy.

32:38.328 --> 32:41.692
You seemed so, I
don't know, heartfelt.

32:41.694 --> 32:43.127
To be honest, I
get a lot of guys

32:43.129 --> 32:44.759
saying they're gonna die,

32:44.761 --> 32:47.861
but most of them are lying
just so they can, you know?

32:48.462 --> 32:49.759
What was different about me?

32:49.761 --> 32:51.895
You're such a talented
graffiti artist.

32:52.129 --> 32:53.559
I am, aren't I?

32:53.561 --> 32:55.526
And the way you put
zero for every answer

32:55.528 --> 32:57.393
on that maths test as a protest

32:57.395 --> 33:00.526
against capitalism blew my mind.

33:00.528 --> 33:02.559
Did you know that I also
wrote Indian swear words

33:02.561 --> 33:03.426
all over my...

33:03.428 --> 33:04.559
Shhh.

33:04.561 --> 33:06.728
Come on, just kiss my face off.

33:11.561 --> 33:12.860
Can we sit here?

33:12.862 --> 33:14.592
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:14.594 --> 33:17.029
the velociraptor show
will begin in 10 minutes.

33:19.129 --> 33:20.493
He needs a plan.

33:20.495 --> 33:22.062
Has he got a plan?

33:31.196 --> 33:32.561
<i>You got a plan?</i>

33:32.762 --> 33:33.629
Yeah.

33:37.229 --> 33:38.695
He hasn't got a plan.

33:46.529 --> 33:48.227
- Ooh.
- Rookie error.

33:48.229 --> 33:49.495
No one wants to see that.

33:53.395 --> 33:54.929
Hi, Georgia.

33:56.062 --> 33:59.729
This may sound kind of
dumb, but can I kiss you?

34:00.896 --> 34:01.762
No.

34:05.529 --> 34:06.794
That went well.

34:06.796 --> 34:09.529
She doesn't wanna kiss him.

34:10.263 --> 34:11.960
Why are you pleased?

34:11.962 --> 34:13.527
I'm not... pleased.

34:13.529 --> 34:14.927
You were pleased.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.661
There was a definite
satisfaction in your...

34:19.096 --> 34:20.096
Oh.

34:20.529 --> 34:21.427
What are you...

34:21.429 --> 34:22.293
This is epic!

34:22.295 --> 34:23.360
It's not epic.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.893
Well, does he know?

34:24.896 --> 34:25.793
Do you know?

34:25.795 --> 34:27.860
You know, but he doesn't know,

34:27.862 --> 34:28.726
and now I know.

34:28.728 --> 34:29.793
Oh, no.

34:29.795 --> 34:31.594
Shut up about knowing, okay?

34:33.929 --> 34:35.927
Well, how are we
gonna find them?

34:35.929 --> 34:36.760
I don't know.

34:36.762 --> 34:38.527
Chase them at high speed?

34:38.529 --> 34:39.994
Oh, I forgot.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.293
You had to make sure
we had travel sweets

34:42.295 --> 34:44.094
and that I was sitting properly,

34:44.097 --> 34:45.793
so we lost them.

34:46.929 --> 34:49.393
My Auntie Gladys
said it never helps

34:49.396 --> 34:51.161
if you lose your temper.

34:51.164 --> 34:52.327
Focus.

34:52.329 --> 34:54.793
We know exactly what he's doing.

34:54.795 --> 34:56.594
What's number two on the list?

34:59.329 --> 35:00.262
Kissing Georgia.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.262
Aw, kissing Georgia,

35:03.930 --> 35:06.164
but we don't know
where he's doing it.

35:06.428 --> 35:07.930
Probably on the mouth.

35:08.829 --> 35:09.729
Just think.

35:10.695 --> 35:13.995
Where does a kid like
that meet this Georgia?

35:13.997 --> 35:14.961
Is it at work?

35:14.963 --> 35:15.727
Probably not.

35:15.729 --> 35:17.095
He doesn't have a job,

35:17.097 --> 35:20.629
so could she be a
friend of his sister's?

35:20.897 --> 35:21.763
Yes!

35:23.197 --> 35:25.527
She's too young to know anyone

35:25.529 --> 35:27.495
he'd be interested
in at that age.

35:29.462 --> 35:30.897
So, that leaves...

35:32.130 --> 35:33.462
Internet dating.

35:34.997 --> 35:36.329
More likely,

35:37.630 --> 35:40.630
he covets what he
sees every day.

35:44.130 --> 35:45.730
The Bible.

35:46.529 --> 35:47.596
Hannibal Lecter.

35:48.428 --> 35:50.028
He knows Georgia from school.

35:50.030 --> 35:51.393
He sees her every day,

35:51.395 --> 35:53.630
and where are most
of his school today?

35:56.097 --> 36:00.393
Uh, yeah,

36:00.395 --> 36:01.463
I know this.

36:02.863 --> 36:03.861
Mu...

36:03.863 --> 36:04.728
The mu...

36:04.730 --> 36:05.761
Mus...

36:05.763 --> 36:07.596
Muesli.

36:09.863 --> 36:10.730
That's a food.

36:11.363 --> 36:12.396
Oh.

36:12.596 --> 36:14.329
What would they be
doing at a food?

36:15.130 --> 36:16.496
Oh, a muesli...

36:19.530 --> 36:20.427
Muesli shop?

36:20.429 --> 36:22.528
Just drive.

36:22.530 --> 36:25.995
Muesli, a muesli and...

36:25.997 --> 36:27.130
Stop talking.

36:34.596 --> 36:36.494
That's okay.

36:36.496 --> 36:37.861
You're learning.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.394
Oh, God, he's going in again.

36:39.396 --> 36:40.561
- Stay here.
- Wait, wait.

36:40.563 --> 36:41.561
What are you gonna do?

36:43.165 --> 36:45.995
- Are you still here?
- He's still here.

36:45.997 --> 36:47.461
Fact is, he won't
be for much longer.

36:47.463 --> 36:48.694
Good.

36:48.696 --> 36:50.427
He won't be 'cause
he'll be gone.

36:50.429 --> 36:51.728
Dead.

36:51.730 --> 36:53.463
I've got 60 minutes
left to live.

36:56.530 --> 36:57.728
Right, come on.

36:57.730 --> 36:58.795
Put your hood up and grab him.

36:58.797 --> 37:00.561
I'm not a child snatcher.

37:00.563 --> 37:02.363
I think that's illegal.

37:03.098 --> 37:04.163
I'll tell the police

37:04.165 --> 37:05.594
it's in the kid's best interest

37:05.596 --> 37:07.062
as we have to get him
to a hospital, okay?

37:07.064 --> 37:07.996
Now, hurry up.

37:07.998 --> 37:09.129
His best interests?

37:09.131 --> 37:10.496
Uh huh.

37:12.131 --> 37:13.728
Why would you say that?

37:13.730 --> 37:14.628
Why would he say that?

37:14.630 --> 37:15.797
'Cause it's true.

37:17.231 --> 37:19.996
Look, you'll have lots
of times in your life

37:19.998 --> 37:20.896
when you can kiss a boy.

37:20.898 --> 37:22.528
I'm sure they'll all be great,

37:22.530 --> 37:24.064
but the bottom line
is this is it for him.

37:25.131 --> 37:26.796
He's never kissed a girl before.

37:26.798 --> 37:27.663
I have.

37:28.463 --> 37:29.862
Have you?

37:29.864 --> 37:31.496
We're kind of losing
the heat here. Can...

37:32.630 --> 37:35.796
Well, he's probably never
kissed a girl before,

37:35.798 --> 37:38.528
and for some reason
he wants to kiss you.

37:38.530 --> 37:40.129
I don't know why,

37:40.131 --> 37:43.631
but he doesn't wanna die
without doing that... thing.

37:44.798 --> 37:45.664
Hey!

37:49.564 --> 37:50.662
Come on, then.

37:50.664 --> 37:52.062
Got to admire roping in a friend

37:52.064 --> 37:53.695
and making up that trash.

38:00.329 --> 38:02.262
Hey, she's my girlfriend.

38:02.264 --> 38:03.329
What are you doing, you jerk?

38:03.664 --> 38:05.096
What are you doing?

38:05.098 --> 38:06.363
You don't own me.

38:08.064 --> 38:09.031
Where's Alf?

38:19.064 --> 38:20.862
I'm not Tim, you moron.

38:20.864 --> 38:23.129
Even he knows that.

38:23.131 --> 38:24.998
Oh, it's ringing.

38:25.898 --> 38:26.697
Give it.

38:30.364 --> 38:31.430
Hello, Tim.

38:33.031 --> 38:33.964
What do you want?

38:34.564 --> 38:35.729
<i>Listen up.</i>

38:35.731 --> 38:37.229
<i>I've been given carte blanche,</i>

38:37.231 --> 38:39.529
which means do whatever
the hell I want in French,

38:39.531 --> 38:41.196
to bring to bring
you back, Sonny Jim,

38:41.198 --> 38:43.428
and if that means eggs
have to be cracked

38:43.430 --> 38:44.964
and omelets have to be...

38:46.166 --> 38:47.097
Hey!

38:51.998 --> 38:53.931
You let the boy escape.

38:57.430 --> 38:58.962
Idiot.

38:58.964 --> 38:59.829
You...

38:59.831 --> 39:00.929
Come here.

39:00.931 --> 39:02.364
Hey, stop that.

39:04.297 --> 39:05.664
Here he is.

39:08.297 --> 39:09.762
What did you do that for?

39:09.764 --> 39:10.662
What?

39:10.664 --> 39:12.328
Say all that stuff to Georgia.

39:12.330 --> 39:15.529
'Cause you were doing so
well on your own.

39:15.531 --> 39:17.629
Quickly, they'll be after us.

39:17.631 --> 39:18.697
Come on, then.

39:29.032 --> 39:33.295
Seems like boys
turn from gentle Jekyll

39:33.297 --> 39:35.364
to Mr. Hyde like they're...

39:40.631 --> 39:42.030
You're so
going to win, Willow.

39:42.032 --> 39:45.196
Apparently Shona doesn't
even know her poem yet.

39:47.032 --> 39:47.899
Come on.

39:49.865 --> 39:50.732
Stop it.

39:51.464 --> 39:52.531
Grow up.

40:03.665 --> 40:04.899
So had you really?

40:05.765 --> 40:06.632
What?

40:07.330 --> 40:08.465
Kissed a girl.

40:09.632 --> 40:12.032
I don't think they saw me,
but we haven't got long.

40:13.032 --> 40:14.863
We haven't got long.

40:14.865 --> 40:17.096
Can't even do a bucket list.

40:17.098 --> 40:19.532
Two big fat failures.

40:20.899 --> 40:23.196
Why didn't I just
grab her and kiss her?

40:23.198 --> 40:24.930
Probably 'cause that
would have been assault.

40:24.932 --> 40:27.398
It's not like there's
time to send me to prison.

40:31.532 --> 40:33.465
It's all slipping
away, isn't it?

40:34.932 --> 40:37.030
- In one hour from now...
- 54 minutes.

40:37.032 --> 40:37.965
Alf!

40:38.832 --> 40:41.264
I thought accuracy
was important.

40:41.266 --> 40:43.062
This is useless.

40:43.064 --> 40:44.863
I'm useless and selfish.

40:44.865 --> 40:46.096
Mum was right.
What's the point?

40:46.098 --> 40:47.696
There it is.

40:47.698 --> 40:49.596
There's that can-do
attitude of yours

40:49.598 --> 40:51.530
that I just love.

40:53.565 --> 40:54.997
There's still time.

40:54.999 --> 40:56.530
Come on.

40:56.532 --> 40:57.897
There are two more
things on that list,

40:57.899 --> 41:00.563
even without the
kissing a girl thing,

41:00.565 --> 41:05.732
and, you know, there
are ways around that...

41:06.232 --> 41:07.498
...if you're...

41:07.698 --> 41:09.164
I think we should move
on to the next thing.

41:09.166 --> 41:10.365
Alf.

41:10.598 --> 41:11.966
You wanna do at
least one last graf.

41:12.865 --> 41:13.465
Yeah.

41:13.799 --> 41:16.498
Okay, so here's a brick wall.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.532
You could show me how
you make the stencil.

41:23.966 --> 41:25.230
Vic, maybe this
isn't the best one.

41:25.232 --> 41:26.398
It smells of...

41:29.598 --> 41:31.230
I can find a better wall.

41:31.232 --> 41:32.465
Whatever.

41:33.532 --> 41:34.565
Wait here.

41:38.365 --> 41:40.999
Oh, there are loads of walls.

41:42.099 --> 41:44.833
Yeah, that's the trouble
with cities, isn't it?

41:45.699 --> 41:48.197
Right, we concentrate
on the streets

41:48.199 --> 41:49.563
in the immediate vicinity

41:49.565 --> 41:52.030
of where we saw them
last, round here.

41:52.032 --> 41:54.331
They're teenagers,
inherently lazy.

41:55.331 --> 41:59.032
They'll use the first wall
they can to put up some graf.

42:01.800 --> 42:04.833
Or, there's another possibility.

42:05.966 --> 42:08.731
He said he wanted to throw
up some graffiti, hm?

42:08.733 --> 42:09.431
Yeah.

42:10.065 --> 42:12.733
But who said it would
be on a wall?

42:21.965 --> 42:24.331
- I don't...
- Oh, just come on.

42:36.499 --> 42:38.065
Oh, Tim, come on.

42:38.633 --> 42:40.963
Ow, what was that for?

42:40.965 --> 42:43.097
I'm trying to knock
some sense into you.

42:44.399 --> 42:46.866
Listen, by the looks of it,

42:47.633 --> 42:48.731
Alf's just got
into that gallery,

42:48.733 --> 42:50.432
so you can throw up some graf.

42:51.399 --> 42:52.766
How awesome is that?

42:54.167 --> 42:55.566
It's pretty cool.

42:55.766 --> 42:56.633
Come on.

42:57.399 --> 42:58.499
Trust us.

42:59.466 --> 43:01.399
What's the worst
that could happen?

44:00.066 --> 44:00.933
Stop.

44:09.567 --> 44:11.565
The whole place is
probably alarmed.

44:11.567 --> 44:13.567
Breaking that window
probably tripped it already.

44:13.834 --> 44:14.864
Probably?

44:14.866 --> 44:15.732
Definitely now.

44:15.734 --> 44:16.964
Come on.

44:16.966 --> 44:17.801
Hurry up.

44:20.866 --> 44:23.598
Lifeform organic
cell matter degeneration

44:23.600 --> 44:26.431
now at 70%.

44:26.433 --> 44:30.000
Confusion and disorientation
highly probable.

44:32.133 --> 44:34.398
Okay, this is the nearest one.

44:44.433 --> 44:45.500
Bingo.

44:48.167 --> 44:49.400
This is perfect.

44:50.066 --> 44:52.333
They've even left all these
blank canvases for you.

44:52.900 --> 44:56.333
I think you'll
find they're finished.

45:07.400 --> 45:08.798
We've got them cornered.

45:38.534 --> 45:39.632

Yeah, open up.

45:56.934 --> 45:58.899

Oh, press it stronger,

No, not yet, but we're trying.

46:43.535 --> 46:44.700
You couldn't help us, could you?

46:45.168 --> 46:46.366
I am the owner.

46:46.368 --> 46:47.601
You are trespassing.

46:49.168 --> 46:50.034
What?

46:51.201 --> 46:52.432
Oh, he says he's the owner,

46:52.434 --> 46:53.767
and we're trespassing.

46:54.700 --> 46:56.299
But I don't understand.

46:56.301 --> 46:59.765
Your banging would not set
off alarm, yet alarm goes.

46:59.767 --> 47:01.599
Oh, there's some kids inside,

47:01.601 --> 47:03.533
and we're trying to catch them

47:03.535 --> 47:05.233
because one of them,

47:05.235 --> 47:06.732
he's only got a short time to...

47:06.734 --> 47:09.499
The owner doesn't need to
know all that, does he?

47:09.501 --> 47:11.633
Now, whoa,
wait a minute.

47:11.635 --> 47:12.533
We're journalists.

47:12.535 --> 47:13.332
Journalists?

47:13.334 --> 47:14.665
He's right.

47:14.667 --> 47:15.665
We are tracking a
kid down in there,

47:15.667 --> 47:16.765
and it's very important

47:16.767 --> 47:19.468
that we get him back unharmed.

47:21.202 --> 47:22.401
We can give you money.

47:23.434 --> 47:24.399

important thing on the list,

47:46.401 --> 47:47.468
if I'm honest.

47:48.468 --> 47:50.068
Something to be remembered by.

47:51.102 --> 47:52.368
You'll be remembered...

47:54.135 --> 47:55.368
for being you.

47:56.835 --> 47:57.667
Thanks.

48:04.568 --> 48:06.499
I can't believe you
didn't do anything.

48:06.501 --> 48:08.000
You're meant to be the muscle.

48:08.002 --> 48:09.332
Excuse me.

48:09.334 --> 48:12.800
I am a still photographer
with slow metabolism.

48:12.802 --> 48:14.466
I'm not your hired heavy.

48:14.468 --> 48:16.267
Alright, shut up.

48:16.269 --> 48:17.768
We need to get in there.

48:20.135 --> 48:22.301
It's all wet on my underside.

48:22.935 --> 48:23.902
Be quiet.

48:34.635 --> 48:35.666
That's one thing off the list.

48:38.102 --> 48:39.235
Oi!

48:47.002 --> 48:48.902
You, take off stencil.

48:50.369 --> 48:52.066
You just hook your
nails underneath.

48:52.068 --> 48:55.167
She do it, not you
with your... hair.

48:55.169 --> 48:56.635
Okay, alright.

49:00.302 --> 49:01.866
Perfect.

49:01.868 --> 49:03.068
What is this?

49:05.402 --> 49:07.100
Oh, it's all about time.

49:07.102 --> 49:08.066
You've got this bit here.

49:08.068 --> 49:09.035
You've ruined my work.

49:11.002 --> 49:11.833
Your work?

49:11.835 --> 49:12.933
Explain before I kill you.

49:12.935 --> 49:14.333
You know what?

49:14.335 --> 49:15.666
This is the last painting
I'm ever gonna do anyway.

49:15.668 --> 49:17.333
That's before you came in here

49:17.335 --> 49:19.333
with your bat and your accent
and your threats, so hey.

49:19.335 --> 49:20.699
What is he talking about?

49:20.701 --> 49:22.599
I've only got 30
minutes left to live,

49:22.601 --> 49:24.866
so I took a bit of a risk to try

49:24.868 --> 49:27.533
and get some of my art into
a gallery in my lifetime.

49:27.535 --> 49:29.001
I'm sorry,

49:29.003 --> 49:31.302
but you must have done
some risky things, right?

49:31.502 --> 49:32.768
What do you know?

49:33.535 --> 49:35.201
We don't know anything.

49:35.203 --> 49:38.101
Art's supposed to provoke
some kind of response,

49:38.103 --> 49:40.833
and doing this has
already got a response.

49:40.835 --> 49:42.533
You hate it, and
you wanna kill me,

49:42.535 --> 49:44.201
and that is all good.

49:49.203 --> 49:50.801
Paint the others.

49:50.803 --> 49:53.500
I'm allergic if it comes
into contact with my skin...

49:53.502 --> 49:55.101
No, not them, you idiot.

49:55.103 --> 49:56.769
The other canvases.

49:57.069 --> 49:59.903
I don't have time, but I
can give you the sten...

50:00.601 --> 50:02.467
<i>Seems like boys turn</i>

50:02.469 --> 50:05.402
<i>from gentle Jekyll to Mr. Hyde.</i>

50:08.836 --> 50:10.533
I've gotta go.
I'm sorry.

50:10.535 --> 50:12.001
I'm really sorry.

50:12.003 --> 50:12.969
You can't just go!

50:13.302 --> 50:14.168
You did it.

50:14.170 --> 50:15.300
Motorbike next.

50:15.302 --> 50:16.201
No.

50:16.203 --> 50:17.836
Sorry.

50:35.369 --> 50:36.168
There you are!

50:36.170 --> 50:37.536
Come here!

50:38.236 --> 50:39.335
Grab him.

50:55.403 --> 50:57.636
Moore Auction House, please.

51:06.336 --> 51:07.803
Oh, not again.

51:10.602 --> 51:11.967
You can do this, Tim.

51:11.969 --> 51:13.567
Let us in.

51:13.569 --> 51:14.636
Open this door!

51:15.403 --> 51:16.435
Let us in.

51:17.702 --> 51:19.435
You have to do it.

51:20.303 --> 51:21.736
You're right.

51:23.769 --> 51:26.370
Yay, Tim's done another
thing on his list.

51:29.104 --> 51:29.934
Alf!

51:29.936 --> 51:31.403
Grab the boy.

51:33.669 --> 51:36.769
Come here, you.

51:37.536 --> 51:38.736
I'm sorry.

52:56.770 --> 52:59.902
<i>Seems like boys
turn from gentle Jekyll</i>

52:59.904 --> 53:00.904
<i>to Mr. Hyde.</i>

53:44.837 --> 53:45.436
Hello?

53:45.637 --> 53:47.138
How are you feeling?

53:47.737 --> 53:50.368
How did you get my...

53:50.370 --> 53:51.701
pushed for time.

53:51.703 --> 53:52.601
I know.

53:52.603 --> 53:54.537
It's vital you come back here.

53:55.436 --> 53:57.069
Can you save my life?

53:57.071 --> 54:00.236
I have a serum that
could prolong your life.

54:00.238 --> 54:01.701
Could?

54:01.703 --> 54:02.637
I need definite, otherwise
I'm wasting time.

54:39.205 --> 54:40.971
<i>Hi, this is Tim.</i>

54:41.571 --> 54:43.771
<i>You know what to do.</i>

54:44.138 --> 54:45.038
Shona?

54:48.471 --> 54:49.738
Understood.

54:50.971 --> 54:54.738
Okay, Mr. Groad wants to
know where Tim's gone.

54:57.172 --> 54:58.704
He's off the list, isn't he?

55:01.371 --> 55:03.269
I've got Tim's number.

55:03.271 --> 55:04.435
How did you get his number?

55:04.437 --> 55:05.638
They got my phone.

55:07.371 --> 55:08.836
Now, I could call him,

55:08.838 --> 55:10.838
but I doubt he'd
tell me, don't you?

55:12.272 --> 55:14.504
He did just abandon you.

55:17.005 --> 55:18.469
It's not his fault.

55:18.471 --> 55:20.571
He's not been the
same since his dad.

55:22.905 --> 55:24.771
All he cares about is himself.

55:25.938 --> 55:28.036
One of his school reports
has the word selfish

55:28.038 --> 55:29.402
in it eight times.

55:29.404 --> 55:30.836
Miss Halliday would
have used it too,

55:30.838 --> 55:32.238
but she went for
self-obsessed to be different.

55:32.437 --> 55:34.536
We can stay here for
as long as it takes,

55:34.538 --> 55:36.702
but I'm almost certain
you'd rather be with him

55:36.704 --> 55:38.771
when, well, you know.

55:42.371 --> 55:43.504
So where is he?

55:46.272 --> 55:48.569
School is really boring.

55:48.571 --> 55:51.402
End up in lectures,
just snoring.

55:51.404 --> 55:52.970
Wondering why...

55:52.972 --> 55:56.870
Remember, the hardest
thing about public speaking

55:56.872 --> 55:59.805
is imagining the abject
humiliation if you fail.

56:02.272 --> 56:03.872
Thanks for the advice, miss.

56:09.638 --> 56:11.972
She'd better be right.

56:14.304 --> 56:15.770
Ah, Mr. Groad.

56:15.772 --> 56:18.872
Yeah, his sister's gone
to some poetry thing.

56:19.872 --> 56:21.804
We're pretty certain
that's where he is.

56:21.806 --> 56:23.335
<i>Okay, get after him.</i>

56:23.337 --> 56:24.571
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

56:24.839 --> 56:27.304
<i>Don't worry.
We're on our way.</i>

56:27.806 --> 56:28.672
Good.

56:29.639 --> 56:31.637
It appears they've caught him.

56:31.639 --> 56:32.904
The boy's heading to his school,

56:32.906 --> 56:34.371
so I can get the
journey to bring him in.

56:34.605 --> 56:36.371
Don't worry, I'll go.

56:36.572 --> 56:38.170
You sure you can handle
this on your own?

56:38.172 --> 56:39.502
He's a child.

56:39.504 --> 56:41.639
Just need to give
him a bit of TLC.

56:42.205 --> 56:44.772
I'm surprised you even
know what that stands for.

56:45.371 --> 56:46.639
Of course I do.

56:48.072 --> 56:49.470
We have to handle
this sensitively

56:49.472 --> 56:51.136
to avoid a PR nightmare.

56:51.138 --> 56:52.371
We must show concern.

56:53.672 --> 56:56.505
I'll be the model of humanity...

56:59.605 --> 57:02.170
as long as he dies on time.

57:02.172 --> 57:04.037
Time
of death predicted,

57:04.039 --> 57:08.503
19 minutes, 36
seconds and counting.

57:08.505 --> 57:13.305
You stupid...

57:15.338 --> 57:16.203
what are you crying for?

57:16.205 --> 57:17.071
It's a moped.

57:19.906 --> 57:21.305
Ow.

57:43.705 --> 57:45.972
Hey, hey, are you okay?

57:47.239 --> 57:48.438
I didn't see you.

57:49.539 --> 57:51.739
You just ran out. Hey!

57:52.372 --> 57:54.403
There's no time to
wee, I'm afraid.

57:54.405 --> 57:55.271
Oh, I don't need to.

57:55.273 --> 57:56.436
No, not you, me.

57:58.206 --> 57:59.370
Oh, go, go, go.

57:59.372 --> 58:03.639
And remember, don't be useless.

58:11.006 --> 58:14.206
Willow Graves scores
nine from the judges.

58:14.472 --> 58:15.773
Go Willow,
you buried them!

58:43.139 --> 58:44.740
I'm going to perform a poem.

58:49.873 --> 58:51.873
It's about my useless brother.

58:58.972 --> 58:59.840
I lost the...

59:02.273 --> 59:03.540
Gonna try from memory.

59:12.972 --> 59:18.907
Seems like boys turn from
gentle Jekyll to Mr. Hyde

59:20.406 --> 59:22.640
like they're switching sides.

59:40.140 --> 59:41.039
Perfect.

59:43.207 --> 59:48.138
Seems like boys turn from
gentle Jekyll to Mr. Hyde

59:48.140 --> 59:50.473
like they're switching sides.

59:52.807 --> 59:54.840
But he didn't go
to the dark side.

59:55.807 --> 59:58.373
He just went to the <i>dick</i> side.

59:59.473 --> 01:00:01.005
Like Two Face,

01:00:01.007 --> 01:00:03.538
this new face I see
on the flip side,

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.040
I don't recognize...

01:00:08.874 --> 01:00:10.738
'Cause I used to have a brother

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.272
who played Connect Four with me,

01:00:13.274 --> 01:00:14.671
balloon off the floor with me.

01:00:14.673 --> 01:00:17.638
And now I've
got this monster,

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.404
selfish giant or ogre
who just doesn't care.

01:00:20.406 --> 01:00:22.272
Never helping Mum,

01:00:22.274 --> 01:00:24.772
shrugging so passively,

01:00:24.774 --> 01:00:27.772
actually causing us grief,

01:00:27.774 --> 01:00:31.741
like he wants to
make us suffer it,

01:00:33.174 --> 01:00:34.641
and we've had enough of it.

01:00:39.207 --> 01:00:41.437
It's time he looked up,

01:00:41.439 --> 01:00:42.607
started seeing.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.641
And turned back
into a human being.

01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:07.907
You deserve a better brother.

01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:15.474
I'm sorry,

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:20.907
but I want you to know,
I'm really proud of you.

01:01:29.707 --> 01:01:34.040
After a shaky start, Shona
Edge has scored a perfect 10.

01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:49.741
Enjoy it.

01:02:08.674 --> 01:02:10.805
At
the 15 minute mark,

01:02:10.807 --> 01:02:13.707
heart rate will
elevate to 100 bpm.

01:02:20.307 --> 01:02:23.438
Oh, God.

01:02:29.841 --> 01:02:30.740
Yes?

01:02:30.742 --> 01:02:32.674
Your services aren't required.

01:02:33.074 --> 01:02:34.175
Wait, what?

01:02:34.808 --> 01:02:37.772
Mr. Groad is no
longer in charge.

01:02:37.774 --> 01:02:39.039
He views this whole thing

01:02:39.041 --> 01:02:41.572
as some sort of
scientific exercise.

01:02:41.574 --> 01:02:43.908
I kept telling him "a boy's
life is at stake here."

01:02:44.974 --> 01:02:46.374
But we had instructions.

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:50.372
What's going?

01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:53.642
Change of plan.

01:02:54.108 --> 01:02:54.974
Back to the lab.

01:02:55.575 --> 01:02:57.405
So is this how I die, then,

01:02:57.407 --> 01:02:58.540
from being hit by a car?

01:02:58.542 --> 01:02:59.606
I have no idea.

01:02:59.608 --> 01:03:00.872
Something is going to kill you.

01:03:00.874 --> 01:03:02.540
You've got a great
bedside manner.

01:03:02.542 --> 01:03:05.006
The main thing is, I can help.

01:03:05.008 --> 01:03:07.208
I've got a team of
doctors waiting.

01:03:07.475 --> 01:03:08.906
- Really?
- And the serum I mentioned,

01:03:08.908 --> 01:03:10.872
it's gonna put a stop to this.

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:11.707
But how can it?

01:03:12.008 --> 01:03:13.338
Do you really have
time for a lecture

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.406
on biochemical nanotechnology?

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:19.705
Well, thanks a bunch.

01:03:19.707 --> 01:03:21.206
Ticked me off the list.
You didn't care, did you?

01:03:21.208 --> 01:03:22.373
If I hadn't gone, my sister
would have thought

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:23.640
I was trying to ruin...

01:03:23.642 --> 01:03:24.573
What has that
got to do with it?

01:03:24.575 --> 01:03:25.774
I wasn't doing my list.

01:03:26.675 --> 01:03:28.041
I had Shona's poem.

01:03:28.642 --> 01:03:30.908
I took it this morning
without her knowing.

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:33.908
I can't be selfish
all my life, can I?

01:03:35.008 --> 01:03:37.041
Is that how I'm
gonna be remembered?

01:03:52.308 --> 01:03:53.540
Take care of Monty for me.

01:03:54.941 --> 01:03:57.739
He eats most things,
especially sausages,

01:03:57.741 --> 01:03:59.007
and he tends to get really narky

01:03:59.009 --> 01:04:00.774
if there's too
much light around.

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:08.441
Finished?

01:04:18.741 --> 01:04:20.209
You've got a motorbike?

01:04:20.575 --> 01:04:21.774
Evidently.

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:24.240
Well, there's one
thing on my bucket list

01:04:24.242 --> 01:04:25.506
that I haven't done.

01:04:37.276 --> 01:04:38.375
Tim?

01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:41.508
What the...

01:04:43.142 --> 01:04:45.506
Victoria, what's going on?

01:04:45.508 --> 01:04:47.240
It's Tim.

01:04:47.242 --> 01:04:48.406
He's dying.

01:04:48.408 --> 01:04:49.873
What?

01:04:49.875 --> 01:04:50.942
In 14 minutes.

01:04:54.408 --> 01:04:56.540

Which way to the demo room?

01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:32.007
We're like a 100
miles away from the museum.

01:05:32.009 --> 01:05:33.742

What on earth for?

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:48.606
This is my laboratory.

01:05:48.608 --> 01:05:50.376
It's better if it's
just the two of us.

01:05:50.608 --> 01:05:52.275
But you said there
were gonna be doctors,

01:05:52.277 --> 01:05:53.673
and if we go to a hospital,

01:05:53.675 --> 01:05:54.975
they'll have all the
right gadgets and...

01:05:58.642 --> 01:05:59.775
I think I wanna go.

01:06:01.509 --> 01:06:02.608
Are you sure?

01:06:12.342 --> 01:06:13.409
Yay.

01:06:28.542 --> 01:06:30.275
What are you doing?

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:31.376
Waiting.

01:06:36.508 --> 01:06:38.376
Look, I'll take
the serum, alright?

01:06:38.642 --> 01:06:40.376
I may have lied a bit.

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:42.542
There is no serum.

01:06:43.409 --> 01:06:45.141
Well, what's...

01:06:45.143 --> 01:06:48.606
This is a traceless neurotoxin,

01:06:48.608 --> 01:06:52.776
just insurance, in case
you don't die on time.

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:57.043
Eight
minutes and counting.

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:09.576
This is the way we
know to the building.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:11.976
Plan B.

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:24.241
You are our first
official human test.

01:07:24.243 --> 01:07:26.210
The machine must
be proved right.

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:31.208
This machine will
change the world.

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:36.442
Everyone born in the future
will get their own expiry date.

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:40.607
The Long Lives, that's
what we'll call them,

01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:43.108
can plan ahead properly.

01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:45.341
The Short Lives, well,

01:07:45.343 --> 01:07:46.674
the world will know not

01:07:46.676 --> 01:07:49.440
to waste valuable
resources on them.

01:07:49.442 --> 01:07:50.741
That's just wrong.

01:07:50.743 --> 01:07:52.341
Bereavement won't
be such a shock.

01:07:52.343 --> 01:07:54.574
Couples can get married knowing

01:07:54.576 --> 01:07:59.541
that they'll be together
for an exact amount of time.

01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:02.408
The phrase "'till
death do us part"

01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:05.674
can be replaced with a date.

01:08:05.676 --> 01:08:07.377
How cool is that?

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:11.409
I wouldn't wanna know when
someone I love is gonna die.

01:08:11.643 --> 01:08:13.244
But you could plan.

01:08:13.843 --> 01:08:16.475
We went to the beach
day before my dad died.

01:08:18.044 --> 01:08:20.810
No one knew that was gonna
be the last time, so...

01:08:23.011 --> 01:08:24.044
we had a great time.

01:08:27.509 --> 01:08:29.276
It's not right to know.

01:08:41.977 --> 01:08:43.573
Are you sure this is
the quickest route

01:08:43.576 --> 01:08:44.908
to the other building?

01:08:44.911 --> 01:08:47.209
It's the
only way I know.

01:08:58.011 --> 01:09:00.642
<i>Lena, what on
earth are you doing?</i>

01:09:00.644 --> 01:09:02.042
Why is he tied up?

01:09:02.044 --> 01:09:03.841
Just call it
an insurance policy.

01:09:03.844 --> 01:09:05.474
<i>He's not
Frankenstein, you crazy woman.</i>

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:08.439
You want this machine to be
proven just as much as I do.

01:09:08.442 --> 01:09:10.276
<i>This is not right.</i>

01:09:10.278 --> 01:09:11.644
We can't do this, Lena.

01:09:11.844 --> 01:09:12.977
Man up.

01:09:13.977 --> 01:09:15.276
You're fired.

01:09:15.278 --> 01:09:18.011
The sound on this is really bad.

01:09:26.111 --> 01:09:27.777
A few moments left.

01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:29.810
We could play I Spy.

01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:37.042
What am I supposed to do?

01:09:37.044 --> 01:09:37.944
I can't stop it.

01:09:39.544 --> 01:09:41.710
It's not the machine
that's gonna kill him.

01:10:01.245 --> 01:10:03.542
Mr. Groad, hello, sir.

01:10:03.544 --> 01:10:04.642
<i>I need you to terminate</i>

01:10:04.644 --> 01:10:06.911
the demonstration in Room 101.

01:10:07.112 --> 01:10:08.742
Sorry, sir.

01:10:08.744 --> 01:10:12.410
Miss Eidelhorn sent everyone
home about 30 minutes ago.

01:10:13.011 --> 01:10:13.942
What?

01:10:13.944 --> 01:10:15.177
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:10:15.179 --> 01:10:16.443
I was just on the way
out the door myself.

01:10:16.811 --> 01:10:17.809
Okay, what's your name, son?

01:10:17.811 --> 01:10:19.012
<i>Kevin, sir.</i>

01:10:19.212 --> 01:10:21.675
Now, you listen very
carefully to me, Kevin.

01:10:21.677 --> 01:10:23.811
Lena has to be
stopped at all costs.

01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:27.443
What do we do?

01:10:28.577 --> 01:10:30.045
You look for a crowbar.

01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:32.377
I'll find another way in.

01:10:34.577 --> 01:10:36.508
I can pick the lock.

01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:38.845
What do you mean, you
can pick the lock?

01:10:39.112 --> 01:10:40.677
I've got tools.

01:10:44.377 --> 01:10:45.876
Oh.

01:10:49.577 --> 01:10:51.408
It's locked from the inside.

01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:52.675
The science woman,
she's gone rogue.

01:10:52.677 --> 01:10:53.876
She's gonna kill your friend.

01:10:53.878 --> 01:10:55.278
How do I get back to the car?

01:10:56.045 --> 01:10:57.776
Follow me.
Where are you parked?

01:10:57.778 --> 01:10:59.544
Stay there.
Do not move.

01:11:07.343 --> 01:11:09.912
Go on, please.

01:11:19.377 --> 01:11:20.443
- Yes.
- Yes!

01:11:36.278 --> 01:11:38.310
Wow, is that a chainsaw?

01:11:42.645 --> 01:11:44.978
Why am I attracted to a
woman with a chainsaw?

01:11:50.645 --> 01:11:52.812
Give me back my son.

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:56.543
No can do.

01:11:58.311 --> 01:11:59.378
Mum.

01:12:17.411 --> 01:12:19.011
Critical
organ failure

01:12:19.013 --> 01:12:21.812
expected in 20 seconds.

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:30.911
10 seconds.

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:31.778
Nine,

01:12:32.913 --> 01:12:34.409
eight,

01:12:34.411 --> 01:12:35.944
seven,

01:12:35.946 --> 01:12:37.342
six,

01:12:37.344 --> 01:12:38.944
five,

01:12:38.946 --> 01:12:40.376
four,

01:12:40.378 --> 01:12:41.877
three,

01:12:41.879 --> 01:12:43.409
two,

01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:44.643
one,

01:12:44.645 --> 01:12:46.676
and life form is extinct.

01:12:46.678 --> 01:12:49.409
Organ cell deterioration
and rigor mortis

01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:52.811
will set in in four hours.

01:12:52.813 --> 01:12:58.046
Time of death confirmed at
14:30 P.M. Greenwich Mean Time.

01:12:58.712 --> 01:13:01.111
This is the 17th successful test

01:13:01.113 --> 01:13:02.813
of the Vitalitron capsule.

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:08.844
The capsule now discharging
battery power back to the grid.

01:13:11.612 --> 01:13:12.710
♪ Tim's alive ♪

01:13:12.712 --> 01:13:13.610
♪ I'm so happy ♪

01:13:13.612 --> 01:13:14.476
♪ Tim's alive ♪

01:13:18.013 --> 01:13:19.344
Look out!

01:13:27.846 --> 01:13:30.579
Time I did something
nice for Tim.

01:13:32.378 --> 01:13:34.077
What are your
feelings, Mr. Groad?

01:13:34.079 --> 01:13:35.977
Well, I want you to know
that when I hired the woman,

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:39.744
her credentials were
absolutely impeccable,

01:13:39.746 --> 01:13:41.410
and I just realized
you're talking

01:13:41.412 --> 01:13:42.979
about the machine, ain't you?

01:13:44.145 --> 01:13:47.277
Well, there's no
denying it's a setback,

01:13:47.279 --> 01:13:49.677
but, hey, come on.

01:13:49.679 --> 01:13:50.946
It's great the kid survived.

01:13:51.412 --> 01:13:53.579
And why do you think
it didn't work?

01:14:03.579 --> 01:14:04.443
What's that?

01:14:04.445 --> 01:14:05.180
What?

01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:07.377
Is that something
in your pocket,

01:14:07.379 --> 01:14:08.078
or are you just
pleased to see me?

01:14:08.379 --> 01:14:09.379
What?

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:11.512
I thought I felt a rattling.

01:14:20.646 --> 01:14:21.779
He's not growling.

01:14:23.712 --> 01:14:24.879
I'm sorry.

01:14:27.612 --> 01:14:29.544
Don't you see what this means?

01:14:29.546 --> 01:14:31.345
He was in my pocket
when I was scanned.

01:14:31.679 --> 01:14:33.877
You can't scan two
things at once.

01:14:33.879 --> 01:14:35.443
I said that.

01:14:35.445 --> 01:14:36.877
Brilliant.

01:14:36.879 --> 01:14:38.646
The machine was not wrong.

01:14:39.746 --> 01:14:40.610
Amazing.

01:14:40.612 --> 01:14:42.445
So we can continue the testing.

01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:45.477
Hey, when I did rehire you?

01:14:45.479 --> 01:14:46.914
But surely...

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.878
You were prepared to kill the
boy to validate the machine.

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:51.477
You were even gonna implicate me

01:14:51.479 --> 01:14:53.077
in your disgusting,
stinking little scheme.

01:14:53.079 --> 01:14:54.712
The police are coming.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.146
Thank you.

01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:02.780
It was a real pleasure to
meet you, Miss Chainsaw Lady.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.814
Don't even think about it.

01:15:20.512 --> 01:15:21.977
Anything?

01:15:21.979 --> 01:15:24.578
Huh, I just don't know
how it didn't record.

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.914
Hm, it's almost
like incompetence.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.814
I have never wet myself.

01:15:33.412 --> 01:15:35.144
Oh, look. There it is.

01:15:35.146 --> 01:15:36.044
Look, right in there.

01:15:36.046 --> 01:15:37.111
Look, look, look.

01:15:37.113 --> 01:15:39.044
Ow.

01:15:39.046 --> 01:15:42.178
We're gonna have to
get another interview.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.079
Shona won the competition.

01:15:49.814 --> 01:15:51.611
I was so proud of you both.

01:15:53.046 --> 01:15:55.547
I've been mean to
her since Dad...

01:15:58.346 --> 01:16:00.580
I'm so sorry he's not here.

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.780
I know I can't be your dad,

01:16:05.814 --> 01:16:08.613
but I will always be your mum.

01:16:12.513 --> 01:16:14.880
He's part of all of us.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.013
He always will be,

01:16:17.814 --> 01:16:20.513
and it's fine to talk about him

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.913
whenever you want.

01:16:25.513 --> 01:16:26.580
Yeah.

01:16:27.913 --> 01:16:29.911
I thought you might
want a keepsake.

01:16:32.513 --> 01:16:34.045
A bucket list?

01:16:34.047 --> 01:16:36.611
We didn't do anything
illegal, but...

01:16:36.613 --> 01:16:38.547
Am I going to get letters?

01:16:45.281 --> 01:16:46.947
I'm really sorry about Monty.

01:16:47.547 --> 01:16:49.145
I know I hated him,

01:16:49.147 --> 01:16:52.680
but I'll help you throw a
small funeral if you like.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.945
Reconnecting
to online network.

01:17:08.947 --> 01:17:11.679
Data mining analysis
now complete.

01:17:11.681 --> 01:17:14.179
Discovery of second life form.

01:17:14.181 --> 01:17:18.646
Now calculating life
expectancy of second life form.

01:17:24.614 --> 01:17:28.712
Second life form
confirmation of human DNA.

01:17:28.714 --> 01:17:31.047
Time of death calculating.

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:35.546
Results due in 10 seconds.

01:17:35.548 --> 01:17:37.179
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

01:17:37.181 --> 01:17:38.279
Three,

01:17:38.281 --> 01:17:39.378
two,

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:40.447
one.
