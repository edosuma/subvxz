00:05.005 --> 00:06.006
<i>Previously on</i> Hightown...

00:06.040 --> 00:07.208
<i>You're pregnant.</i>
- Pretty fucking sure

00:07.241 --> 00:08.542
<i>who the father is--
that's the problem.</i>

00:08.576 --> 00:11.011
<i>Stop it!</i>
- You're fired.

00:11.045 --> 00:13.080
<i>The only thing I know
how to do is be a cop.</i>

00:13.114 --> 00:14.281
Could you help me out
a little bit here?

00:14.315 --> 00:17.685
If a civilian could find out
who supplied Coco Connor

00:17.718 --> 00:20.020
before this death,
that would work.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.489
Go make us some money, honey.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.257
<i>You know that girl
Jorge was banging?</i>

00:23.290 --> 00:24.358
Daisy.
- He's her pimp.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.127
Oh, she's gonna make
a nice little CI.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.661
I'm working
with Frankie and Jorge now.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.097
<i>But I could float you
a little something to sell inside.</i>

00:30.131 --> 00:32.133
I want to make you feel good.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.167
No.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.301
<i>What's your dad like?</i>

00:34.335 --> 00:35.636
He's an old-ass fisherman.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.204
Lost part of his finger
on a tuna boat

00:37.238 --> 00:38.706
and still made
his quota that day.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.041
I want to go
to the Drug Diversion Unit,

00:41.075 --> 00:42.410
do that easy time in green.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.278
Not giving you anything
till you give me something.

00:44.311 --> 00:47.415
<i>Kizzle--he's in

about shark poaching,

You really think
the Scrodfather's

04:25.666 --> 04:26.967
gonna talk to you?

04:27.001 --> 04:28.636
Yeah...

04:28.669 --> 04:31.372
because believe it or not,
we respect each other.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.007
He knows every fleet,
every fisherman,

04:33.040 --> 04:35.309
every goddamn fish
in the ocean.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.945
And that's how you solve cases.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.815
Or didn't they teach you that
down there at the State Police?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.926
Hey, now, Eddie Murphy, huh?

04:54.528 --> 04:56.964
What's the charge this time--
outsmarting an officer?

04:56.997 --> 04:58.365
I don't know, Gustavo.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.700
You tell me
what you've been doing.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.735
I'll tell you
what the charges are.

05:01.769 --> 05:02.803
He ever tell you the time

05:02.836 --> 05:04.638
that he tried to bust me
for fraud?

05:04.672 --> 05:05.973
He was selling flounder
for haddock.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.975
- Everybody knew that.
- Tell it to the judge.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.377
Oh, wait, he thought
it was bullshit, too.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.479
Oh, you mean the judge
who mysteriously retired

05:12.513 --> 05:15.382
back to Portugal three months
after your trial?

05:15.416 --> 05:16.684
<i>Can you blame the man?</i>

05:16.717 --> 05:19.319
Who wants to live in a dump
like New Bedford, huh,

05:19.353 --> 05:20.721
where everyone's on the take?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.456
All right, so, listen,

05:22.489 --> 05:23.957
we got some reports
of shark poaching on the Cape.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.826
Come on,
I'm a businessman, huh?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.695
You think I want to bother
with that shit?

05:27.728 --> 05:29.830
Of course not--we just thought
if anything was happening,

05:29.863 --> 05:31.832
you'd be the guy to talk to.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.368
Well, for one, there's
no uh, real domestic market

05:34.401 --> 05:35.869
for shark meat.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.505
<i>But some Asians in New York
go crazy for it.</i>

05:38.539 --> 05:39.873
They use the fins for soup

05:39.907 --> 05:41.341
and the rest

05:41.375 --> 05:43.577
for hard-on remedies
and whatnot.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.713
We know all that.
We need a name.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.348
For old times' sake.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.418
And maybe I don't go spot-check
the <i>Gemma Rose</i> right now.

05:54.054 --> 05:57.124
I heard a few things
about a Billy Moran.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.460
Like what?

05:59.493 --> 06:02.096
Oh, come on, that's your job.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.667
Billy Moran?
You fucking kidding me?

06:06.700 --> 06:07.801
What a waste of time.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.870
No, no, no.
It makes perfect sense.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.506
Billy was into some
wicked-weird shit before.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.375
And I got a deckhand on one
of his boats owes me a favor.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.611
Billy is Gustavo's competition.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.480
Gus is just trying
to get a free leg up.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.148
I'm gonna talk
to my deckhand friend

06:21.381 --> 06:22.883
- when we get back to the Cape.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.419
Jesus, you're such a stubborn
old goat, you know that?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.055
At least buy me
a Portuguese coffee

06:28.088 --> 06:30.657
while we're all the way out
in fucking New Bedford.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.093
Hey, you gonna see Rafael
while you're here?

06:34.995 --> 06:37.431
I wasn't planning on it.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.566
I-I'm just saying,
if- if you want to,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.802
I'm happy to go with you.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.971
Ah, come on, don't look
at me like that.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.973
Like what?

06:46.006 --> 06:48.842
Fuck it, let's just go.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.087
Fishery Service! Don't move!

07:01.121 --> 07:02.689
Don't worry.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.826
I can't even move
a goddamn bowel.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.467
What's new?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.436
You know, just--
just doing my thing.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.708
Long time, Ed.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.177
Yep.

07:26.513 --> 07:27.681
How you holding up?

07:27.714 --> 07:30.184
Are you kidding? Fucking great.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.586
- Whoa, man.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.788
That a late night
or an early morning?

07:34.822 --> 07:37.958
Oh, that's rich
coming from you.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.861
You know what? You're right.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.130
Knock yourself out, Dad.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.135
So...

07:48.168 --> 07:50.971
you came all the way here
just to see your old man?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.874
Uh...not me, no.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.076
Ed--Ed's looking
for a career drinker

07:56.109 --> 07:58.846
to watch
the Pats games with, right?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.948
Oh, shit, I'll watch
the game with you.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.917
Huh? We'll go to Sully's,
eat some wings.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.486
Maybe Jackie here can teach us
how to pick up chicks.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.157
I'm afraid those days
are behind me.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.693
Ah, whatever.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.127
- How's Mom?
Ugh.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.163
You know...

08:16.196 --> 08:18.198
always mad about something.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.235
You should call her.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.505
Oh, fuck. No, I do call her.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.709
<i>Yeah. Not my fault
she doesn't tell you anything.</i>

08:30.911 --> 08:33.113
Listen, we got to get back
to work, okay?

08:33.146 --> 08:35.015
Take care of yourself, <i>viejo.</i>

08:36.083 --> 08:38.552
Come on, Jack.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.254
<i>Un abrazo.</i>

08:41.555 --> 08:42.556
Eh?

08:56.937 --> 08:58.672
It's good to see you, <i>flaca.</i>

08:58.705 --> 09:01.575
Yeah, you too.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.577
All right.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.212
Come on.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.220
Ever since Anna was a baby,

09:13.253 --> 09:16.590
I would imagine what it would
be like to lose her.

09:16.623 --> 09:19.226
I know that sounds crazy,
but, I mean,

09:19.259 --> 09:21.662
doesn't every parent do that?

09:24.031 --> 09:25.565
It's something
I would test-drive

09:25.599 --> 09:26.900
every once in a while,

09:26.934 --> 09:29.636
just to imagine what the pain
would be like, but, um...

09:35.809 --> 09:38.078
It's unimaginable.

09:38.111 --> 09:42.683
Thank you, Martha.
Anyone else like to share?

09:47.654 --> 09:50.691
- Hi, I'm Ray.
Hi, Ray.

09:50.724 --> 09:54.194
My son, Nick...

09:54.227 --> 09:57.764
he took it really hard
after the divorce.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.634
He started acting out and...

10:00.667 --> 10:02.669
hanging out with a rough crowd.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.874
It all just happened right
in front of my eyes, you know.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.610
I just didn't do enough.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.013
And let's face it,
I was never a great father.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.819
Anyway, um, he's gone now.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.821
He's incarcerated.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.823
He's doing four years
for dealing drugs.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.625
I got a lot of shame
about this, 'cause--

10:25.659 --> 10:27.027
I mean, I don't even know
if I should be here.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.663
I'm listening to your stories.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.932
<i>Some of you have lost your
sons and your daughters,</i>

10:31.965 --> 10:35.669
and here I am with my son,
the drug dealer.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.939
<i>So, in a way,
I've lost him, too.</i>

10:59.359 --> 11:01.695
All right, see you.
See you.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.866
Hey, you're smart
to bring your own.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.868
You know, coffee usually sucks
at these things.

11:07.901 --> 11:11.171
I work at Dibby's, so it's
free, even on your off-days.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.806
Oh, wow, that's awesome.

11:12.839 --> 11:16.843
Yeah.
- Hey, um, I'm Ray, by the way.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.880
- Hi.
How you doing?

11:21.381 --> 11:24.051
I liked what you said
in your share.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.786
Made me feel better.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.055
My, um...

11:28.088 --> 11:29.923
my son was a dealer, too.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.726
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

11:32.759 --> 11:35.095
I mean, he made mistakes, sure,

11:35.128 --> 11:37.898
but he didn't have
to die like that.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.267
Oh, wait, wait,
what happened?

11:40.300 --> 11:44.037
Some scumbag killed him,
shot him,

11:44.071 --> 11:47.140
right in the face,
in his own damn car,

11:47.174 --> 11:48.408
over fucking drugs.

11:48.442 --> 11:52.079
- I am so sorry.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.146
What was your son's name?

11:53.180 --> 11:54.347
- Collin.
- Collin?

11:54.381 --> 11:57.217
Collin Connor.
Everyone called him Coco.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.752
Coco.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.922
Hey, do you know who was
supplying him the drugs?

12:01.955 --> 12:04.724
- Why's it matter now?
- No, I'm sorry, it doesn't.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.461
I was just wondering if your
son and my son knew each other.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.362
- Oh.
- So...

12:09.396 --> 12:12.065
Collin was mixed up with a lot
of people over the years,

12:12.099 --> 12:16.103
but last I knew,
it was with this Black girl.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.938
- Black girl?
- Yeah.

12:17.971 --> 12:21.408
- Was supplying him?
- I mean, yeah, I think so.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.110
- Yeah.
- She live around here?

12:23.143 --> 12:27.114
Well, she didn't grow up here,
I could tell you that much.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.083
I mean, I'm not--
I'm not racist or anything,

12:30.117 --> 12:32.452
but...you know what I mean.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.789
Yeah.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.292
What was her name?

12:40.827 --> 12:43.797
Who even cares anymore?
You know?

12:43.830 --> 12:45.132
Yeah. I know.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.768
It's okay.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.082
She's probably just got
the TV on too loud.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.518
- Yeah.
Yeah.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.821
Oh, my God.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.490
Look at my little lady-killer.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.459
<i>Hey, Nana.</i>
- Hi.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.494
All right, thanks, Mom.
I'm working late tonight,

13:14.528 --> 13:16.463
so I'll pick him up
in the morning.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.231
Just make sure
he's had his breakfast,

13:18.265 --> 13:19.266
and no sugar cereal.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.433
- I know the drill.
- Okay.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.903
But I don't have anything
for dinner tonight.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.305
Yeah.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.175
Just plain cheese.
He doesn't like pepperoni.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.110
What about the tip?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.313
Yep.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.848
Lights out by 8:30.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.483
And, seriously,
no candy before bed, okay?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.018
Remember what happened
last time?

13:38.051 --> 13:40.253
Something's different
about you.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.391
- What?

13:44.424 --> 13:45.959
Did you get your boobs done?

13:45.992 --> 13:48.228
What? No.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.564
It's okay.
They look very natural.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.200
Okay, can we stop
talking about this, please?

13:53.233 --> 13:54.868
- Hmm.
- Here's his stuff.

13:54.901 --> 13:55.902
Sure.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.038
All right. Mwah.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.839
I'll pick you up
in the morning, okay?

13:59.873 --> 14:01.007
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.842
Okay.
- Love you. Have fun.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.844
Say, "Bye, Ma."
Bye, Ma.

14:04.878 --> 14:08.048
Bye.
Come on, kiddo.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.859
Drug Diversion Unit, huh?

14:19.893 --> 14:21.595
So it's all drug dealers
up in here?

14:21.628 --> 14:24.898
It's not drug dealers.
It's drug addicts.

14:24.931 --> 14:27.000
Nonviolent motherfuckers.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.902
Dudes who don't need
to be in prison.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.370
They need to be in rehab.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.172
What these motherfuckers do,

14:32.205 --> 14:35.008
they put the rehab
in the prison.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.910
So you get clean
while you do your time.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.211
What's wrong with that?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.249
Shit's private.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.885
Some CEO making 60 Gs a month
off you and me being here.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.921
You think they gonna let
a Black man be free

14:47.954 --> 14:51.091
in this country
when they making money off us?

14:51.124 --> 14:52.392
Nah, bro.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.995
They want us in here--
real talk.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.897
So how long you in for?

14:57.931 --> 15:00.200
Judge say 36 months
if I'm good.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.534
Then I got to go
to a halfway house

15:01.568 --> 15:03.169
for who the hell knows
how long.

15:03.203 --> 15:06.239
Indeterminate sentencing.
Now, that shit's fucked up.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.540
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

15:07.574 --> 15:09.309
I ain't even have my trial yet.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.212
And we know it's gonna be
a while before that door opens.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.519
So you one of these
nonviolent motherfuckers?

15:21.454 --> 15:25.125
Man, I'm just some dude
out of Opa-Locka, Florida.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.495
- Mm, so you a Southern boy.
- Never felt like home, though.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.930
Always felt like
the town freak.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.300
It might because you're Black
with blonde hair.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.505
I just started listening
to beats,

15:38.538 --> 15:40.940
sipping on a little dirty Sprite.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.209
- So you was on that lean.
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:43.243 --> 15:46.112
But, you know, in FLA,
pills is everywhere,

15:46.146 --> 15:48.448
so I graduated
to Oxys right quick.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.319
<i>Next thing you know, fuck it,
I'm straight shooting dope,</i>

15:52.352 --> 15:55.422
<i>and I steal anything
that wasn't tied down.</i>

15:55.455 --> 15:58.291
My nasty ass stole
a girl's retainer once.

15:58.325 --> 16:01.227
You must have slung some
all that time.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.996
Little somethin'-somethin'
to get my piece,

16:03.029 --> 16:05.665
but never really made
no real money.

16:05.699 --> 16:08.335
I been in and out of lockup
since I was 16.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.104
Shit.
Vernon, you fucking tragic.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.474
One good thing
about Emerald City,

16:14.507 --> 16:17.344
they loose with that Suboxone.

16:17.377 --> 16:21.081
Since I been here,
I've been clean.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.050
Delgado.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.020
Let's go, man.
You got physical therapy.

16:27.053 --> 16:30.123
Oh, shit. Y'all got doctors
in this motherfucker?

16:39.232 --> 16:41.201
<i>♪ Baby ♪</i>

16:42.168 --> 16:45.305
<i>♪ Reach into my grave...♪</i>

16:47.674 --> 16:49.743
Ready to get started?

16:51.077 --> 16:54.080
<i>-Thanks, Thomas.</i>

16:55.215 --> 16:57.617
I'm Janelle,
your physical therapist.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.020
We're gonna start
rehabbing your injury.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.056
You the one that gets me
my pain meds?

17:03.089 --> 17:05.158
I help people heal
their injuries,

17:05.191 --> 17:06.559
not ignore them.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.062
There's no quick fix here.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.064
How's your leg feel now?

17:11.097 --> 17:12.699
My left leg hurts when I walk,

17:12.732 --> 17:14.701
but, um...

17:14.734 --> 17:17.170
my third leg's ready
for some exercise.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.640
- I need a male assist.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.075
<i>I'm on the way, Janelle.</i>

17:22.108 --> 17:24.544
Look, no, hold on, hold on.
I...

17:24.577 --> 17:26.212
I'm sorry.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.082
I shouldn't have said that,
all right? I apologize.

17:29.115 --> 17:32.152
<i>My mama didn't raise me
to talk to a lady like that.</i>

17:32.185 --> 17:34.554
It's just...

17:34.587 --> 17:37.824
this place makes you crazy.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.595
The way you're moving now,
you'll never heal right.

17:42.629 --> 17:46.065
If you work hard,
maybe you'll change that.

17:46.099 --> 17:49.669
But in here, you respect me.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.137
You pull that business again,

17:51.171 --> 17:53.807
and you'll be limping your way
back to GenPop.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.542
Got it?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.710
You okay?

17:57.744 --> 18:00.413
We still need that male assist?

18:00.447 --> 18:02.549
No, ma'am.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.285
Thanks, Thomas.
- Mm-hmm.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.153
We're good.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.360
You need to lose weight.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.597
<i>Best thing for that leg
is exercise and a good diet,</i>

18:17.630 --> 18:19.599
so stay out the commissary.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.601
That processed food
will kill you.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.269
And then I can get you a pass

18:23.303 --> 18:25.472
so you can spend
more time in the yard.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.775
Now, let's see
what we're working with.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.511
Make your way over
to the parallel bars.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.160
- I got you.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.869
You're stronger than you think.
You can do this.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.639
Now, hold on
with just your right hand.

19:18.224 --> 19:21.361
All right.
It's on, motherfuckers!

- Yeah.

20:18.618 --> 20:22.422
Anytime you need a moment,
I'm all ears.

20:26.926 --> 20:30.263
- Oh, shit. Donna came through.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.465
Daisy's real name
is Britney Chin.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.269
Okay.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.374
Britney Chin?
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:44.777 --> 20:47.914
Mm. Okay, solicitation, fraud.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.016
She did eight months
for trafficking class A

20:50.249 --> 20:51.484
<i>back in 2016.</i>

20:51.517 --> 20:55.622
Oh, fuck, yeah.
She's still on probation.

20:55.655 --> 20:59.025
Oh, Britney Chin,
we're coming for you, girl.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.660
Oh, shit, it's almost three.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.695
What? What?
What's happening at three?

21:02.729 --> 21:04.564
While you were out
chasing pirates,

21:04.597 --> 21:06.899
I set up a meeting with a CI.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.469
<i>Actually, I think
you might know her.</i>

21:23.316 --> 21:24.417
Hey, girl.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.753
Hey.
You look good.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.489
- Yeah, so do you.
- Thanks. Cutting sugar.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.858
Mm, that's the answer.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.029
"Not a cop," huh?

21:36.062 --> 21:37.630
<i>Hey, Renee.
Good to see you.</i>

21:37.664 --> 21:40.366
- What's this about?
- We're just checking in.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.969
Seeing how everything's
working out with Frankie.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.071
It's fucking amazing.
Thanks for asking.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.807
Good. I'm happy for you.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.942
And, look,
we owe you a lot, okay?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.678
You helped the department
weed out a bad apple--

21:51.711 --> 21:54.847
Okay, cut the shit.
What do you want?

21:56.649 --> 21:59.919
We've been hearing rumors
about prostitution at Xavier's.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.488
<i>We wouldn't want something
like that to blow back on you.</i>

22:02.522 --> 22:03.790
Yeah, right.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.992
Right, I know what you want.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.960
But those days
are behind me, so...

22:07.994 --> 22:09.962
We know you would never
betray Frankie.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.998
That's not that we're asking.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.067
We want Jorge.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.537
<i>We hear he's the one
who's pimping.</i>

22:17.570 --> 22:19.505
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:25.411 --> 22:29.582
But if Jorge were doing
something like that,

22:29.615 --> 22:31.017
it's not on me and Frankie.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.556
I don't have eyes in the back
of my head, you know?

22:36.589 --> 22:37.957
We know.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.859
We just wanted
to give you a heads-up.

22:41.761 --> 22:44.030
- So can I go?
- Of course.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.412
That was interesting.

22:59.445 --> 23:02.448
That was Renee throwing Jorge
under the bus.

23:03.616 --> 23:04.884
So what's the play?

23:04.917 --> 23:06.819
Work the Daisy lead,
catch her in the act,

23:06.853 --> 23:08.087
get her to talk.

23:08.121 --> 23:10.456
Like a sting operation.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.891
All right, so how's that work?

23:11.924 --> 23:14.427
Shit, we used to use Ray
for things like this.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.963
Look how that turned out.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.065
Now we got to train
someone else.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.900
I mean, how hard could it be
to find a guy

23:20.933 --> 23:22.535
who wants to get a blow job?

23:22.568 --> 23:25.772
Hey, Ray, what's so
important you had to drag me

23:25.805 --> 23:28.107
all the way out here
to the sticks?

23:29.742 --> 23:32.945
Coco Connor's supplier
was a Black girl.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.080
You got a name?

23:34.113 --> 23:35.982
No. No, no, no.
But hear me out here.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.484
How many Black females have you
and I arrested on the Cape?

23:38.518 --> 23:40.453
It's not many, right?

23:40.486 --> 23:43.623
So who's got juice?
Jericha Smith?

23:43.656 --> 23:46.459
No, she's doing eight years
in Framingham.

23:46.492 --> 23:48.895
Okay, okay, what about
that girl in Harwich?

23:48.928 --> 23:50.930
Um... Patricia Sinclair.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.965
Nah, she's been out of the game
for a while.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.066
She's got her CNA.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.835
Well, good for her.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.138
Hmm.

24:03.843 --> 24:07.547
Dealing with carfentanyl,
Wayne Grasa was the connect.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.448
What females run in his circle?

24:13.986 --> 24:17.590
Hey, you remember
the girls at Wayne's house?

24:17.623 --> 24:21.127
- The sisters.
- Ah, come on, those are kids.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.695
I mean...

24:23.863 --> 24:25.064
You know, the older one

24:25.097 --> 24:27.500
was kind of
a piece of work, though.

24:27.533 --> 24:30.837
Charmaine.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.539
I'll think about it.
Hit up my CI.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.675
Who's that?

24:35.708 --> 24:37.777
I ain't got to tell you shit.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.883
Don't you look mighty chipper?

24:45.651 --> 24:47.520
You like your new spot?

24:47.553 --> 24:49.856
<i>Those easy-time greens
are working out for you.</i>

24:49.889 --> 24:52.692
Ain't gonna lie.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.528
This rehab shit is dope.

24:55.561 --> 24:57.563
Got me stretching
and bending like a pretzel.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.965
You know, next time
they got you in there

24:58.998 --> 25:02.535
touching your toes,
remember who put you in here.

25:02.568 --> 25:05.071
And know that I can
take you back out again.

25:05.104 --> 25:08.641
I gave you a damn body, man.
Ain't that enough?

25:08.674 --> 25:11.711
It's enough when I say
it's enough.

25:13.746 --> 25:16.182
Now, tell me about
Charmaine Grasa.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.550
Who?

25:18.751 --> 25:19.919
So you don't know the girl

25:19.952 --> 25:23.723
that was in Wayne's house
the day you got shot.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.625
I hear you right?

25:25.658 --> 25:28.828
Little chick. Wayne's niece.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.730
Yeah, I seen her,

25:30.763 --> 25:32.765
usually on my way out.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.035
Well, any chance she took
over the family business

25:36.068 --> 25:37.570
once Wayne got pinched?

25:37.603 --> 25:40.573
You think Wayne is gonna let
a female take over?

25:40.606 --> 25:42.041
Come on, man.

25:42.074 --> 25:46.212
Well, any chance she, you know,
struck out on her own?

25:46.245 --> 25:48.281
And don't lie to me.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.049
How the fuck should I know?

25:50.082 --> 25:52.151
I never said more than
two words to her.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.223
You...

25:57.256 --> 26:00.559
are fucking useless.

26:00.593 --> 26:03.129
<i>Enjoy your yoga
while it lasts.</i>

26:18.277 --> 26:19.845
Excuse me.

26:19.879 --> 26:23.649
Can I see the, uh, visitor log
for inmate Emmanuel Delgado?

26:23.683 --> 26:24.684
Sure.

26:38.664 --> 26:40.900
Charmaine Grasa.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.803
That lying motherfucker.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.074
<i>All right, gentlemen,</i>

26:48.107 --> 26:51.143
<i>let's welcome Jasmine
to the main stage.</i>

26:51.177 --> 26:54.847
<i>♪ I know I said
That I wasn't gonna call you ♪</i>

26:58.751 --> 27:00.686
<i>♪ But things got manic
And I thought ♪</i>

27:00.720 --> 27:02.822
<i>♪ That I should warn you ♪</i>

27:02.855 --> 27:06.192
Damn, girl, you made all this?

27:06.225 --> 27:08.694
<i>That's why they call you
Platinum,</i>

27:08.728 --> 27:10.896
'cause you expensive, baby.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.299
<i>Mmm, mmm, mmm.</i>

27:13.332 --> 27:16.669
Oh, baby, you're gonna get me
all revved up again.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.372
I'll see you soon, Dale.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.673
Uh-huh.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.014
Were you Daddy's
good little girl?

27:28.047 --> 27:30.649
What do you think?

27:33.085 --> 27:35.354
<i>Okay.</i>

27:37.123 --> 27:40.659
Did you keep your thong on
when he fucked you, baby?

27:40.693 --> 27:42.395
Yeah.

27:42.428 --> 27:45.331
And it's soaking wet.

27:45.364 --> 27:48.334
'Cause I was thinking
about you.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.803
I want to fuck you so bad.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.916
Baby.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.218
Baby.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.854
Hello.

28:13.759 --> 28:16.929
I'm sorry, <i>mami.</i>
My head is killing me.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.097
Yeah.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.867
What's wrong?

28:23.769 --> 28:25.771
We need to talk about Jorge.

28:27.173 --> 28:30.209
Okay. What about Jorge?

28:30.242 --> 28:32.411
You know he's running girls
out of the club?

28:34.113 --> 28:35.381
Where'd you hear that?

28:35.414 --> 28:38.084
I didn't hear it from anyone.

28:38.117 --> 28:41.387
You know, he's not exactly
keeping it secret.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.389
<i>We still have heat
on us, okay?</i>

28:43.422 --> 28:47.026
And your cousin is putting
you and me in danger.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.360
It's stupid.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.436
<i>You're right.</i>

28:57.470 --> 29:00.873
<i>You've always had my back,
and I appreciate it.</i>

29:00.906 --> 29:02.341
<i>And Jorge...</i>

29:02.374 --> 29:05.211
I love him,
but he get crazy sometimes.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.879
Yeah.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.215
I'll talk to him.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.783
Okay.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.118
When?

29:14.820 --> 29:16.255
When?

29:32.404 --> 29:36.242
- I'll talk to him right now.
- Thank you.

29:44.383 --> 29:47.353
- Yes, please!

29:47.386 --> 29:48.988
You want that?

29:49.021 --> 29:51.290
Hey, you, come here.
Let's dance.

29:51.323 --> 29:54.293
- Ooh, yeah.
- Hey.

29:54.326 --> 29:55.794
See you inside, Jorge.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.163
What's up, <i>primo?</i>

29:58.330 --> 30:01.167
We need to talk.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.968
About what? You good?

30:03.002 --> 30:04.336
No. I'm not.

30:06.872 --> 30:09.475
I just found out Osito got
moved to a different unit.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.845
- How he pull that?
- How the fuck do you think?

30:12.878 --> 30:16.148
<i>Hablando, cabrón.</i>

30:16.182 --> 30:18.984
The thing is,
I don't have people over there,

30:19.018 --> 30:21.854
so it's gonna
make things harder.

30:21.887 --> 30:24.223
Well, we'll find a way, man.
We always do.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.927
- There's something else.
- Yeah?

30:27.960 --> 30:30.329
The running girls
out the club, <i>primo,</i>

30:30.362 --> 30:32.198
it's got to stop.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.300
With cops sniffing around,

30:34.333 --> 30:36.502
we don't need
the extra headache, <i>¿tú sabes?</i>

30:36.535 --> 30:37.970
After all the shit

30:38.003 --> 30:40.005
that we been through,
you don't trust me.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.208
I trust you with my life.

30:42.241 --> 30:43.976
But I need to protect
my family, bro.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.878
Okay.

30:45.911 --> 30:48.147
Renee got into your head. Okay.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.548
No, no, I don't want no problem

30:49.548 --> 30:50.916
with your wife, we are fine.

30:50.916 --> 30:51.951
No, no, no, no Renee, no.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.252
This is not Renee, this is me.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.521
You understand me?

30:55.521 --> 30:56.488
Okay. Okay, no doubt. No doubt.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.023
But, listen,
at the end of the day,

30:58.057 --> 30:59.291
it don't matter what I say

30:59.325 --> 31:01.894
or what your <i>nena</i> says,
you got to do you.

31:01.927 --> 31:05.864
No one tells me what to do.
Let's get that straight.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.434
Of course not.
Man, you're the fucking man.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.502
Look, you... you want
to protect your family,

31:10.536 --> 31:13.205
and I say you are
protecting your family.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.241
Look at this place.
It's your place.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.911
Frankie Cuevas
from Banana Boat Island

31:18.944 --> 31:21.380
is paying the fucking IRS, man.

31:21.413 --> 31:24.350
I mean, you're not paying them
everything, but, shit...

31:26.085 --> 31:29.088
What does that have to do
with the girls, <i>primo?</i>

31:29.121 --> 31:30.589
Nothing.

31:32.958 --> 31:36.562
But I am who I am,
and I like what I like.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.265
But you know what?
You got it, boss.

31:39.298 --> 31:40.933
I'll tone it down.

31:56.315 --> 31:57.549
Ron Stark!

31:57.583 --> 31:59.952
Jesus fuck, Jackie,
what'd you do that for?

31:59.985 --> 32:02.655
Oh, come on, you know
you miss me, penis-head.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.356
It's nice to know you been
thinking about my penis.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.658
Oh, God, stop.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.159
It's bad enough I already know
what it looks like.

32:07.192 --> 32:08.527
Hey, be nice.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.996
My... my fragile ego can't take
too much more of that.

32:11.030 --> 32:14.300
Okay, but, listen,
I need a favor.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.201
No, you mean another favor,

32:16.235 --> 32:17.970
'cause the last time I checked,
you never got me that drink

32:18.003 --> 32:19.305
after I gave you access
to the boat log.

32:19.338 --> 32:20.606
Listen,
I-I'll buy you two drinks

32:20.639 --> 32:22.207
if you hook a sister up
one more time.

32:22.241 --> 32:25.177
And trust me, it's fun.
Cop-related.

32:28.213 --> 32:31.183
Don't you got, like, fancy
friends at your fancy new job?

32:31.216 --> 32:33.585
I need you to buy a blow job
from a stripper.

32:35.254 --> 32:38.157
Shit, why didn't you
just say that?

32:44.029 --> 32:46.332
<i>What's up, partner?</i>

32:46.365 --> 32:49.335
Motherfucker.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.337
Where you at with that
Black girl tip, huh?

32:51.370 --> 32:53.005
What the fuck
you doing here, man?

32:53.038 --> 32:55.007
I know your routine.
You talk to your secret CI?

32:55.040 --> 32:56.975
You still looking
at Charmaine Grasa?

32:57.009 --> 32:58.711
Actually, I'm on my way
up there now.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.646
Going to Charmaine's
aunt's house up on Boston--

33:00.679 --> 33:03.315
Charmaine's last known
physical address.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.650
Yo, that's great.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.285
We leave now,
we'll be there before noon.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.354
<i>"We"? Motherfucker,
ain't no we.</i>

33:08.387 --> 33:10.556
This is not <i>Starsky & Hutch,</i>
and we not rolling up

33:10.589 --> 33:11.724
in no Gran Torino.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.459
- Get the fuck out.
- Whoa. Wait a minute.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.760
I'm the one
who brought you Charmaine.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.095
Yeah, you did.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.496
And if the theory
on the table's correct

33:17.529 --> 33:19.031
and Charmaine's our new player,

33:19.064 --> 33:21.367
I doubt she's at her
aunt's house 90 minutes away.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.268
So I don't need help
asking some old lady

33:23.302 --> 33:24.636
where her niece is at.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.072
You remember
when Jackie got shot?

33:27.106 --> 33:29.641
We did everything right.
We followed protocol.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.677
And then, bam, that just
blew up in our face, didn't it?

33:31.710 --> 33:33.612
Now you're telling me that
you're gonna drive out there

33:33.645 --> 33:35.180
alone with no backup

33:35.214 --> 33:38.350
and question a family member
of Wayne fucking Grasa?

33:38.384 --> 33:39.752
- Fuck you, Abruzzo.
- What?

33:39.785 --> 33:41.353
Think you slick as shit.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.222
Trying to school me
and all that?

33:43.255 --> 33:45.157
I know what you trying to do,
and the shit ain't working.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.358
Okay, fine, I know, I know.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.693
But I'm not
bullshitting you, though.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.194
You got a family.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.362
Go ahead, call me an asshole

33:50.396 --> 33:52.331
for wanting your kid
to have a dad.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.068
Really?

33:56.101 --> 33:58.404
Wow.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.072
Fine.

34:00.105 --> 34:02.107
But only 'cause
I feel sorry for your ass.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.277
Works for me.

34:13.485 --> 34:16.288
Looking good. Looking good.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.090
Okay.

34:18.123 --> 34:19.758
Ugh.

34:19.792 --> 34:22.161
Why is your chest so greasy?

34:22.194 --> 34:24.263
It's not grease. It's sweat.

34:24.296 --> 34:25.631
Is it working?

34:25.664 --> 34:27.566
I don't know.
It's pretty greasy.

34:27.599 --> 34:30.202
It's not--I'm...
I'm a little fucking nervous,

34:30.235 --> 34:31.537
and you guys are being
really mean to me.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.604
Okay, I'm sorry. You're right.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.440
I'm sorry.
You're gonna be great.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.575
I wouldn't have asked you if
I didn't think you could do it.

34:36.608 --> 34:39.111
That's better.

34:39.144 --> 34:40.612
All right, so what's the plan?

34:40.646 --> 34:42.347
So...

34:42.381 --> 34:44.149
this is Daisy.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.350
You're gonna go in.

34:45.384 --> 34:47.219
You're gonna get
a private dance from her.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.087
Then you're gonna get her
to move to your car.

34:49.121 --> 34:50.856
So we'll be watching.
We'll be listening.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.792
Once the money is exchanged,
we'll roll up.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.495
Does that make sense?

34:56.528 --> 34:58.831
- Yes.
- All right.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.733
Let's test this fucker out.
Speak into your mic.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.336
Uh, testing.
One, two, three, four.

35:04.369 --> 35:05.737
It work? Good?
- Good.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.273
See?
Hey, you're a natural, Ron.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.309
Who else has had
more experience paying for sex

35:10.342 --> 35:12.578
than you, huh?

35:12.611 --> 35:14.613
Okay, listen,
no, seriously, though.

35:15.647 --> 35:18.417
You're gonna keep your head
on in there, okay?

35:18.450 --> 35:21.320
The Cuevas cousins
are some real ones.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.655
- So...

35:23.689 --> 35:25.324
You be careful.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.696
- I got it.
- You got it.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.231
All right?

35:32.264 --> 35:34.900
Fucking get off me. All right.

35:40.539 --> 35:41.807
He'll be fine.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.812
Ten bucks
he comes in his pants.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.385
Hey, how are you?

35:55.153 --> 35:57.689
<i>♪ Put your right hand out ♪</i>

35:57.723 --> 36:00.559

37:29.848 --> 37:32.417
You can touch me if you want...

37:32.451 --> 37:34.453
for a little extra.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.889
Well, how about you touch me?

37:42.427 --> 37:43.795
Yeah, she's sussing him out.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.931
- Yeah.
- Come on, Daisy.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.767
<i>Are you a cop, cowboy?</i>

37:50.535 --> 37:52.270
It's 'cause
of the mustache, right?

37:52.304 --> 37:54.506
Nah, I-I-I get that
all the time.

37:57.009 --> 37:59.945
Look, I know I look
like a... a serious ass-kicker,

37:59.978 --> 38:03.415
but, you know, in reality,
I spend all day on a boat.

38:06.885 --> 38:10.489
Blow job's 200.
Full service is 300.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.559
Cool. Yeah.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.895
<i>Uh, that's... that's great.</i>

38:16.928 --> 38:20.666
Um, you know, it... it doesn't
feel very, uh, private in here,

38:20.699 --> 38:22.334
and... and I-I was thinking

38:22.367 --> 38:24.302
that maybe we could go
out to my car.

38:24.336 --> 38:25.871
That'll be another 50.

38:31.977 --> 38:35.347
350.
Guess you want everything, huh?

38:35.380 --> 38:38.350
Oh, I want
the "hole" enchilada.

38:38.383 --> 38:39.951
The H-O-L-E.

38:39.985 --> 38:43.689
- The hole enchilada.

38:49.561 --> 38:50.996
- Oh.

38:56.802 --> 39:00.105
Uh, uh, Daisy?

39:00.338 --> 39:02.374
Cease and desist, love.

39:02.407 --> 39:04.109
That was a donation,
not a payment.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.813
State Police.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.514
You seriously kidnapping me
right now?

39:09.548 --> 39:11.083
We got you for soliciting
and engaging,

39:11.116 --> 39:12.718
and it's recorded in full 2K.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.953
<i>Blow job's 200.
Full service is 300.</i>

39:14.986 --> 39:16.021
That was entrapment.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.456
That was
strike two solicitation

39:17.489 --> 39:20.559
on top
of a probation violation.

39:20.592 --> 39:21.827
How do you think
that's gonna go over

39:21.860 --> 39:22.994
with the judge, Britney?

39:23.028 --> 39:24.863
What judge?
You don't have a case.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.665
<i>Oh, come on,
you don't believe that.</i>

39:26.698 --> 39:28.567
You got two options.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.503
You cooperate,
or we take you in.

39:35.841 --> 39:38.043
<i>Why don't you make it
easy on yourself</i>

39:38.076 --> 39:39.811
and tell us something
about Jorge?

39:39.845 --> 39:42.013
I'm not a snitch, bitch.
Are we done?

39:42.047 --> 39:43.515
The fuck we are.
You're under arrest.

39:43.548 --> 39:44.850
<i>No, wait. Hold on, hold on.</i>

39:44.883 --> 39:48.153
Listen, Britney, I know
we put you in a tough spot.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.789
It's a lot to take in.
I get that.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.791
Why don't you take some time.

39:52.824 --> 39:55.427
Think about it, okay?
Just take some time.

39:55.460 --> 39:58.597
<i>Twenty-four hours,
we don't hear from you,</i>

39:58.630 --> 40:00.432
we'll walk into the club
and put you in bracelets

40:00.465 --> 40:01.867
in front of everyone.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.508
You need to let me keep
the cash.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.510
He's expecting it.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.886
I really hope I hear from you.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.487
Suck a dick.

40:30.662 --> 40:33.098
Get me a drink.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.640
Another.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.749
Everything okay?

40:50.782 --> 40:51.950
Yeah.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.222
What happened?

40:57.455 --> 41:00.592
Nothing, Daddy. I'm fine.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.064
Just a jerk customer.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.533
Poor baby.

41:08.567 --> 41:11.036
Come on, let's go have a talk.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.682
Tell me.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.717
It's not a big deal.

41:25.750 --> 41:28.920
He tried to do
some freaky shit, that's all.

41:28.954 --> 41:31.056
The bald prick.

41:31.089 --> 41:34.092
He looked like a cop.
Was he a cop?

41:34.125 --> 41:37.162
No. Of course not.
I'm not an idiot.

41:37.195 --> 41:40.165
- You would tell me he was.
- Yes, of course.

41:42.601 --> 41:43.869
Why are you getting
all defensive?

41:43.902 --> 41:46.004
I'm not!

41:46.037 --> 41:49.174
Here, take your money.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.010
I have to get back
on the floor.

41:52.043 --> 41:53.879
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

41:53.912 --> 41:55.814
We're not done here.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.250
You know you're not really
my dad, right, bro?

41:58.283 --> 42:00.619
Oh!

42:00.652 --> 42:03.221
Don't give me
no fucking attitude.

42:03.255 --> 42:06.091
When I ask you a question,

42:06.124 --> 42:09.227
you answer me the first time.

42:13.265 --> 42:17.135
Get the fuck out of my club,
nasty-ass ho.

42:19.070 --> 42:20.772
Go!

42:23.808 --> 42:26.077
Hi. This is Renee Segna.

42:26.111 --> 42:29.714
I was just checking
on my furniture delivery.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.850
Oh, amazing.

42:31.883 --> 42:34.052
Okay.

42:34.085 --> 42:35.220
<i>Daisy.</i>

42:35.253 --> 42:36.988
Fuck you, too.

42:40.025 --> 42:41.993
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

42:44.963 --> 42:46.932
Now you know
what happens to people

42:46.965 --> 42:48.600
that get on my fucking nerve!

42:48.633 --> 42:49.935
Let me get a drink.

43:00.812 --> 43:02.213
<i>You know the drill, man.</i>

43:02.247 --> 43:05.216
We're just here to verify
last time the girls was here.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.952
Maybe get a new address.

43:06.985 --> 43:08.820
Uh, we're not trying
to spook anyone.

43:08.853 --> 43:09.955
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.
- Right?

43:09.988 --> 43:11.122
Okay.

43:25.203 --> 43:27.339
- Yes?
- Uh, good morning, ma'am.

43:27.372 --> 43:29.107
I'm Sergeant Alan Saintille

43:29.140 --> 43:31.242
with the Cape Code Interagency
Narcotics Unit.

43:31.276 --> 43:33.044
Are you Ruth Grasa-Monteiro?

43:33.078 --> 43:35.380
Yes. Uh, what can I do for you?

43:35.613 --> 43:37.115
We was just wondering
if you could answer

43:37.148 --> 43:38.650
a few questions
about your nieces,

43:38.683 --> 43:41.086
uh, Charmaine and Aileen?

43:41.119 --> 43:43.054
- What's this about?
- Uh, routine stuff.

43:43.088 --> 43:44.222
Shouldn't take long.

43:44.255 --> 43:46.224
Um, we're following up
on a related case

43:46.257 --> 43:48.360
and was wondering, when's
the last time you seen 'em?

43:48.393 --> 43:51.029
Seen them? They're right here.

44:00.672 --> 44:03.675
Just, uh, a standard
welfare check, really.

44:03.708 --> 44:05.343
You do that every time
you arrest someone's uncle?

44:05.377 --> 44:08.013
You got me there.

44:08.046 --> 44:10.682
But, uh, how you been?
You know, how's school?

44:10.715 --> 44:13.018
How you think? School sucks.

44:13.051 --> 44:15.153
You know, it's been so long,
I almost forgot.

44:15.186 --> 44:17.655
Uh, you guys go around here?

44:17.689 --> 44:20.725
Nope.
Auntie Ruth homeschools us.

44:21.793 --> 44:24.162
You want to see the paperwork?

44:24.195 --> 44:25.730
Not right now.

44:26.965 --> 44:29.401
So you guys, um,
share a room, or...

44:29.434 --> 44:32.137
Yeah. Want to see?

44:32.170 --> 44:34.239
Smell my drawers
while you at it?

44:34.272 --> 44:35.940
That won't be necessary.

44:35.974 --> 44:38.443
Aileen, you like living here
at your Auntie Ruth's?

44:38.676 --> 44:41.279
- Yeah, it's cool.
<i>What do you do for fun?</i>

44:41.312 --> 44:42.981
I like playing video games.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.315
Here at Auntie Ruth's?

44:44.349 --> 44:47.118
Auntie Ruth's, the mall,

44:47.152 --> 44:50.855
my friend's house,
my cousin's house,

44:50.889 --> 44:55.360
Best Buy, video game store,
sometimes the library.

44:55.393 --> 44:56.761
Okay, we got it. Thank you.

44:56.795 --> 44:59.731
So, listen,
we were wondering, um...

44:59.764 --> 45:01.766
when's the last time
you guys been to the Cape?

45:01.800 --> 45:04.202
Cape Cod?

45:04.235 --> 45:05.970
I was just there.

45:07.972 --> 45:11.242
I went to visit
my boy Osito in prison.

45:11.276 --> 45:12.844
He's a good friend of yours?

45:12.877 --> 45:15.013
Used to come visit
at my uncle's house.

45:15.046 --> 45:18.249
Figured I'd go say hi,
see how he's doing.

45:18.283 --> 45:20.218
Yeah, you guys stay
on the Cape at all?

45:21.920 --> 45:24.289
I told you, we live here.

45:26.925 --> 45:29.961
You guys hear about all the
carfentanyl deaths on the Cape?

45:29.994 --> 45:31.162
All these kids your age,

45:31.196 --> 45:32.797
they're just dropping
like flies.

45:32.831 --> 45:36.101
You know, you just touch
that stuff, it could kill you.

45:36.134 --> 45:38.369
That's dangerous
fucking business, isn't it?

45:38.403 --> 45:41.139
Sure sounds like it.

45:41.172 --> 45:44.776
If we're all done here,
we got to get ready for church.

45:44.809 --> 45:45.910
Oh, of course, of course.

45:45.944 --> 45:47.846
Uh, we got to get going,
too, right?

45:47.879 --> 45:50.115
It's a long ride
back to the Cape.

45:53.151 --> 45:55.186
Fucking Osito tipped her off.

45:55.220 --> 45:56.454
You figure?

45:58.957 --> 46:00.325
Hey, wait a minute.

46:00.358 --> 46:02.360
Hey, is that--is that your CI?

46:02.393 --> 46:04.129
Hey, don't say shit.
I don't want to hear it.

46:04.162 --> 46:06.364
Yeah, no, no, man.
Good for you. Good for you.

46:06.397 --> 46:07.899
You know, you flipped
the big man.

46:07.932 --> 46:09.234
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, just don't let that shit

46:09.267 --> 46:11.202
come back
and bite you in the ass, okay?

46:11.236 --> 46:13.805
I need career advice
from you, I'll let you know.

46:13.838 --> 46:15.540
All right,
so what you thinking here?

46:15.773 --> 46:18.076
I'm thinking Charmaine
is smart as hell.

46:18.109 --> 46:19.410
And she's in with Osito.

46:19.444 --> 46:20.912
You see the way
her kid sister flinched

46:20.945 --> 46:23.815
when I asked
if they stayed on Cape Cod?

46:23.848 --> 46:25.316
They're definitely
staying there.

46:25.350 --> 46:26.551
Question's where?

46:31.022 --> 46:33.424
Looks like we got ourselves
a live one.

46:43.835 --> 46:46.337
What is wrong
with straight girls?

46:46.371 --> 46:49.874
Why does a chick like Daisy
protect an asshole like that?

46:49.908 --> 46:53.344
Daddy issues.
I mean, she is a stripper.

46:53.378 --> 46:55.046
Ah, no.

46:55.079 --> 46:58.016
Everyone's got daddy issues,
hon, not just the strippers.

46:58.049 --> 47:01.352
- Not Jackie Quinones.
- What about you?

47:01.386 --> 47:02.520
You're the one who fucked Ray.

47:02.554 --> 47:05.990
- Oh! Fair point.
- Mm-hmm.

47:06.024 --> 47:08.159
- My dad is a cop.
- Ah.

47:08.193 --> 47:09.427
- I rest my case.
- Yep.

47:09.460 --> 47:12.063
So, you know, emotionally
unavailable and violent.

47:14.032 --> 47:16.467
But I learned a lot from him.

47:16.501 --> 47:20.104
Think I got my drive from him,
my competitive spirit.

47:27.078 --> 47:29.280
Your dad know you like women?

47:29.314 --> 47:32.016
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he's cool with it.

47:32.050 --> 47:33.151
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

47:33.184 --> 47:34.485
Huh.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.487
I thought the Latinos
weren't down with that stuff.

47:36.521 --> 47:39.257
Aw, you're so cute
when you're racist.

47:39.290 --> 47:41.292
I'm serious.

47:41.326 --> 47:44.529
Uh, I don't know, you know?

47:44.562 --> 47:46.297
I'm an only child.

47:46.331 --> 47:49.901
Probably wanted a boy,
so I think, in a way,

47:49.934 --> 47:52.904
he related to me more because
I wanted to fuck chicks.

47:52.937 --> 47:55.406
I don't know, that is
literally all he wants to do,

47:55.440 --> 47:57.075
so, you know, barf.

47:57.108 --> 47:59.010
Oh, yeah, no,
let's keep talking about that.

48:01.512 --> 48:04.082
I mean, we can if you want.

48:04.115 --> 48:06.251
Ah, it's fine.

48:06.284 --> 48:07.652
Just wish he hadn't put my mom

48:07.885 --> 48:10.922
through all that shit,
you know?

48:10.955 --> 48:12.657
But whatever.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.092
I mean, they're still married,

48:14.125 --> 48:16.427
so, like,
what the fuck do I know?

48:47.392 --> 48:50.161
Fuck, I want to fuck you
so much right now.

48:54.699 --> 48:57.468
Ugh.

48:57.502 --> 48:58.536
Hello.

48:58.569 --> 49:01.139
Is this Officer Quinones?

49:01.172 --> 49:03.308
Uh, yeah, this is Jackie.

49:03.341 --> 49:05.977
Thanks for calling me, Britney.

49:06.010 --> 49:09.314
I want to talk,
but just to you.

49:09.347 --> 49:11.115
All right. Yeah. Just me.

49:11.149 --> 49:14.218
Um, can you--
can you get to P-town?

49:14.252 --> 49:17.288
Yeah. Okay.
In, like, 30 minutes?

49:17.322 --> 49:19.657
<i>Yeah.
I'll text you an address.</i>

49:21.426 --> 49:24.529
Oh, shit,
she wants to meet me, alone.

49:24.562 --> 49:26.297
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

49:26.331 --> 49:28.266
That's amazing.
You gonna be okay?

49:28.299 --> 49:29.600
It's your first solo CI.

49:29.634 --> 49:31.969
- I think I can handle it.
- Okay.

49:32.003 --> 49:33.171
Good.

49:33.204 --> 49:35.340
'Cause I want you
to come home to me.

49:41.212 --> 49:44.248
- Oh, shit, I got to go.
- Okay.

49:44.282 --> 49:46.651
Here, take my keys.

49:46.684 --> 49:49.620
I want you waiting for me
when I get home.

50:10.241 --> 50:11.676
Hey.

50:11.709 --> 50:13.678
Thanks for coming, Britney.

50:13.711 --> 50:17.115
- Did I have a choice?
- Everybody's got a choice.

50:17.148 --> 50:19.484
Yeah? Are you on probation?

50:23.621 --> 50:25.056
You from here?

50:25.089 --> 50:27.492
No, no, but I've...
I've been here a long time.

50:27.525 --> 50:30.094
Yeah. What about you?
Where you from?

50:30.128 --> 50:32.497
I'm American, bitch.

50:32.530 --> 50:36.033
I meant where did you grow up?

50:36.067 --> 50:38.403
Oh.

50:38.436 --> 50:40.538
Can we sit down?
My feet are fucking killing me.

50:40.571 --> 50:42.407
Yeah, yeah, sure.

50:48.413 --> 50:50.715
I'm from shithole Lowell.

50:50.748 --> 50:53.718
My parents came there
for a better life.

50:53.751 --> 50:57.722
Guess what.
We're still fucking poor.

50:57.755 --> 51:00.091
I got the fuck out.

51:00.124 --> 51:01.759
Yeah. I hear that.

51:03.394 --> 51:05.763
So what happened in 2016?

51:10.535 --> 51:12.437
I had this boyfriend.

51:12.470 --> 51:15.306
One day, we were driving,
we get pulled over.

51:15.339 --> 51:17.108
He asked me to tuck some shit,

51:17.141 --> 51:19.444
and somehow I get charged
with trafficking.

51:23.114 --> 51:25.583
At least he makes
cute babies, though.

51:25.616 --> 51:28.119
You got kids?

51:28.152 --> 51:30.121
Just one.

51:30.154 --> 51:32.156
Valentina.

51:32.190 --> 51:35.193
My parents took custody of her
when I went to prison.

51:39.497 --> 51:41.599
I can't go away again.

51:41.632 --> 51:43.634
I'll never get her back.

51:45.470 --> 51:46.737
Jorge do that?

51:49.173 --> 51:50.441
Whatever.

51:50.475 --> 51:52.310
Takes two to tango, right?

51:57.482 --> 52:00.485
Look, I could use the kid thing
to get you to cooperate,

52:00.518 --> 52:02.587
but I don't want to do that.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.489
The Cuevas cousins have killed
at least two women

52:04.522 --> 52:06.491
that we know of.

52:06.524 --> 52:08.192
You're not safe.

52:08.226 --> 52:10.728
But if you help us,
I can protect you.

52:13.764 --> 52:15.867
And you won't say shit
to my probation officer?

52:15.900 --> 52:17.168
No.

52:21.372 --> 52:23.341
Okay, then...

52:23.374 --> 52:25.376
...what do you want to know?

52:27.245 --> 52:28.412
The drugs.

52:32.850 --> 52:35.820
He works with this
Black girl, Charmaine.

52:35.853 --> 52:38.689
She supplies for them.
I heard him on the phone.

52:38.723 --> 52:40.658
Where does Charmaine get it?

52:40.691 --> 52:42.293
Some guy in New York.

52:42.326 --> 52:43.895
They just call him New York,

52:43.928 --> 52:46.464
like, the dumbest
code name ever.

52:46.497 --> 52:49.634
Yeah. And this is--this is
really good stuff, Britney.

52:49.667 --> 52:53.204
Um, any chance you know
Charmaine's phone number?

52:53.237 --> 52:56.841
- No.
- Or Jorge's business phone?

52:56.874 --> 52:58.543
I could get them.

52:58.576 --> 53:01.178
That--yeah, that'd be amazing.

53:04.315 --> 53:07.618
Is that good enough for now?
He's gonna be looking for me.

53:07.652 --> 53:08.786
Yeah. Of course.

53:08.819 --> 53:10.488
Um, but I'm gonna check in
with you tomorrow

53:10.521 --> 53:13.591
after you've seen him,
make sure you're okay.

53:14.725 --> 53:17.395
I'll be fine. I'm tough.

54:00.738 --> 54:01.939
Hey.

54:01.973 --> 54:03.774
Hmm.
- Wake up.

54:07.278 --> 54:10.014
Daisy's gonna get us
Frankie and Jorge.

54:11.449 --> 54:15.286
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
make sergeant by 40.

54:17.288 --> 54:20.758
Oh, that's so fucking hot.
