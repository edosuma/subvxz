Have a long sleep.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.320
[sniffs]

00:39.440 --> 00:42.040
See you in the spring,
when you finally bloom again.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.199
Poor, Ollie. He gets so sad
when those flowers stop blooming.

00:47.320 --> 00:50.440
Not this year, Stanley!
I had a brainstorm!

00:50.599 --> 00:54.239
I'm taking Ollie somewhere
that will make him so happy!

00:54.400 --> 00:57.239
-Ooh! Where?
-South Africa!

00:57.400 --> 01:01.120
When it's fall here in Brooklyn,
it's spring in South Africa!

01:01.239 --> 01:03.320
-No way!
-Yes way!

01:03.480 --> 01:07.480
And I found a spot where flowers
bloom in the most amazing way!

01:07.600 --> 01:09.759
It's called the Flower Route!

01:09.880 --> 01:11.080
Wow!

01:11.560 --> 01:13.640
-Want to come?
-Wish I could,

01:13.800 --> 01:16.840
but today through Tuesday
I'm running in the snail marathon!

01:16.960 --> 01:18.520
Aw, that's too bad!

01:18.679 --> 01:21.800
Ollie's going to love it,
though! Watch this!

01:24.399 --> 01:25.640
Surprise!

01:25.800 --> 01:26.720
Oh...

01:26.839 --> 01:28.280
[embarrassed laugh]

01:28.399 --> 01:31.880
Ollie, I've planned a surprise
trip today to cheer you up,

01:32.039 --> 01:34.600
and so you won't miss
your flowers so much.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.759
Surprise trip? Where?

01:36.880 --> 01:38.960
[sing-song]
It's a surprise!

01:39.080 --> 01:40.679
Aren't surprises the best?

01:40.800 --> 01:42.320
I suppose.

01:42.479 --> 01:45.119
Unless you're the type who likes to plan,

01:45.240 --> 01:46.399
like me.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.839
The planning type, who likes to plan.

01:49.039 --> 01:50.280
No need to worry, Ollie.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.520
You guys are going to have
an amazing time!

01:52.679 --> 01:56.160
-See you at the snail marathon.
-Snail marathon?

01:56.320 --> 01:59.320
Moon, we can't miss Stanley's big day!

01:59.440 --> 02:03.440
Pfft. You two go on.
It's a snail marathon.

02:03.559 --> 02:06.839
I'll still be running it
when you get back! Ha, ha, ha!

02:07.119 --> 02:11.120
Besides, we're already
packed and ready! See? Come on!

02:11.280 --> 02:13.359
But... where are we going?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.799
Whoo!

02:22.239 --> 02:23.400
Whee!

02:30.760 --> 02:33.480
<i>-Now arriving in...</i>
-Yes?

02:33.640 --> 02:36.640
<i>Can't tell you. It's a surprise!</i>

02:42.040 --> 02:45.880
Phew! Is it ever hot.
Is your surprise a fan?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.239
No, but don't worry!

02:48.400 --> 02:51.040
We'll be on the cool bus in no time!

02:53.600 --> 02:55.040
[sighs]

02:59.120 --> 03:00.920
What's taking so long?

03:01.079 --> 03:03.400
The schedule says
it should be here by now.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.239
Moon, you're reading it upside down.

03:06.359 --> 03:07.640
Oops.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.840
Looks like the bus doesn't
come for another three hours.

03:11.480 --> 03:12.600
[nervous laugh]

03:12.760 --> 03:13.880
Surprise!

03:14.480 --> 03:17.359
No problem, Moon. We'll just go
with your back-up plan.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.040
Back-up plan? What's a back-up plan?

03:20.160 --> 03:23.239
It's what you do when your first
plan doesn't work out.

03:23.399 --> 03:26.000
When you plan a trip,
you always have a back-up plan.

03:26.120 --> 03:29.239
I can see why! It's a great idea!

03:30.640 --> 03:33.160
That, of course, I've already thought of.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.480
And that back-up plan thingy is... Uh...

03:37.399 --> 03:38.239
Uh...

03:38.399 --> 03:41.440
-I'll get us some cold drinks.
-It's, uh... uh...

03:41.600 --> 03:45.720
Uh... uh... uh...

03:46.320 --> 03:50.519
I've got it! Instead of taking
the bus, we're gonna take that!

03:50.640 --> 03:51.560
Come on!

03:54.239 --> 03:56.079
Wonder where the driver is?

03:56.239 --> 03:57.799
-Hello!
-Aaah!

03:57.959 --> 04:00.720
Oh, no! I startled you! I'm sorry!

04:00.959 --> 04:03.119
That's OK. We startled you first.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.640
-I'm Moon and this is Ollie.
-Hi! I'm Squeak!

04:06.799 --> 04:10.000
They call me that 'cause
I squeak when I'm surprised.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.959
-Sorry about your shirt.
-No problem, Squeak.

04:13.119 --> 04:15.000
I'll just get another one from the bag.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.560
You did pack an extra shirt, right?

04:17.680 --> 04:18.760
[nervous laugh]

04:18.920 --> 04:20.000
Surprise again.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.440
[buzzing]

04:23.640 --> 04:27.800
Wow. Flies must really like
this marula fruit juice, huh?

04:27.960 --> 04:30.200
-Aaah! Get away! Shoo!
-Uh-oh!

04:30.840 --> 04:35.599
-I don't like buzzing things!
-Aaah! Shoo! Me neither.

04:35.719 --> 04:38.599
Don't worry, guys.
Flies can't hurt you! Huh?

04:39.000 --> 04:42.280
But they sure have a good imagination.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.919
[Ollie chuckles]

04:44.080 --> 04:46.560
Hop in! I bet we can outrun them!

04:56.360 --> 05:00.919
Now that it's over,
that was pretty funny, wasn't it?

05:01.080 --> 05:01.960
[laughs]

05:02.080 --> 05:04.280
What? I thought you were upset, like me!

05:04.400 --> 05:07.760
Oh, I was. But I got over it.

05:08.159 --> 05:10.000
So, where are we going?

05:10.120 --> 05:12.760
[whispers]

05:12.919 --> 05:17.960
Ho, ho! Ooh! That is a great surprise!

05:18.120 --> 05:20.960
-Oh, you're going to love it.
-Can you guys give me a hint

05:21.120 --> 05:22.320
about where we're going?

05:22.440 --> 05:26.039
Well, it's a long drive.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.400
-Did you pack lunch?
-I wanna say yes?

05:29.520 --> 05:32.039
Yup! I've got it right...

05:32.159 --> 05:35.120
-Oh, no!
-Oh, no? What "Oh, no"?

05:35.280 --> 05:37.560
That sounds like another surprise!

05:37.719 --> 05:41.039
Surprise!
I accidentally brought the wrong bag.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.919
This is my beach bag.

05:43.039 --> 05:46.240
How about I share my koeksisters
and melkterts with you?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.680
They're specialties of South Africa.

05:48.840 --> 05:52.520
Aha! So that's where we are!
South Africa!

05:52.680 --> 05:55.760
[sing-song] But you still don't know
where we're going!

05:55.960 --> 05:58.960
Thank you, Squeak!
That's really kind of you.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.320
Mmm.

06:00.479 --> 06:02.520
The milktert is full of sweet custard!

06:02.680 --> 06:05.280
And the koeksister looks like a doughnut,

06:05.440 --> 06:08.440
but has coconut and sticky syrup inside.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.479
It's delicious!

06:11.240 --> 06:14.080
-And now I'm wearing it.
-Uh-oh!

06:14.240 --> 06:15.760
Dust storm ahead!

06:16.120 --> 06:18.680
Aaah!

06:18.799 --> 06:21.479
Is my hair mussed up?
My hair feels a little mussed.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.880
Ah! Stop!

06:24.919 --> 06:26.000
That is it!

06:26.120 --> 06:31.159
I'm hot and dirty and sticky
and my hair is really poufy.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.400
Before we have any more
surprises, I need to clean up.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.880
Let me check the map for a place to stop.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.840
Ollie, look! A wild ostrich!

06:41.039 --> 06:43.599
How neat! How super neat!

06:47.080 --> 06:49.080
Not that neat, actually!

06:49.200 --> 06:51.159
Getting less neat every second!

06:51.280 --> 06:54.359
It's OK, Ollie. I know this ostrich.

06:54.479 --> 06:56.280
He's friendly.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.440
He must think you're a yummy, yummy bush.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.240
I'll just send him on his way.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.000
[honks]

07:03.159 --> 07:06.640
There you go! Now, back to the map.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.440
OK. Here's a spot that...

07:09.799 --> 07:11.120
Aaah!

07:11.400 --> 07:14.599
Looks like I'm going for a ride!

07:15.120 --> 07:17.520
-Hold on, Squeak!
-We're coming!

07:19.359 --> 07:20.680
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

07:22.159 --> 07:23.799
Whoa!

07:25.719 --> 07:28.479
Wow! Talk about a surprise!

07:28.680 --> 07:32.280
-You must be so upset!
-Upset? No!

07:32.440 --> 07:35.280
Now I know what it's like
to ride an ostrich!

07:35.400 --> 07:38.440
And, hey, whaddaya know? We're here!

07:38.599 --> 07:40.919
We are?

07:41.080 --> 07:44.799
Oh, boy! It's the moment
you've been waiting for, Ollie!

07:45.080 --> 07:46.799
Your cheer-up surprise

07:46.919 --> 07:49.919
so you don't feel sad about your flowers!

07:50.200 --> 07:51.799
Ta-dah!

07:54.960 --> 07:57.359
Is this the surprise?

07:57.520 --> 08:01.640
Uh, this is really nice... dirt.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.320
The surprise is about to happen!

08:04.479 --> 08:08.400
-Really soon. Right, Squeak?
-There's no way to know really.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.719
Sometimes it happens
early spring, sometimes later.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.479
So, you could be waiting for weeks.

08:14.599 --> 08:17.159
Weeks? Waiting for weeks?

08:17.280 --> 08:19.479
Could things be any worse?

08:22.840 --> 08:24.400
Yep. They could.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.880
Aaah! I'm getting wet! I'm getting wet!

08:27.039 --> 08:29.120
I don't like getting wet!

08:29.280 --> 08:32.439
Me, either!
Rain is the worst surprise ever!

08:34.880 --> 08:36.439
Still... It is refreshing!

08:36.559 --> 08:39.360
And it's washing
the sticky leaves off your head!

08:39.480 --> 08:41.199
Plus... this is fun!

08:41.360 --> 08:43.280
[squeaks]

08:43.400 --> 08:45.040
Squeak, you're amazing!

08:45.160 --> 08:46.680
How come you always look so happy,

08:46.840 --> 08:49.280
even though you don't like
surprises any more than I do?

08:49.400 --> 08:51.240
What is your secret?

08:51.360 --> 08:52.720
[squeaks and laughs]

08:52.840 --> 08:55.800
I can't control
all the surprises in my life,

08:55.959 --> 08:59.640
but I can control
how upset I get about them.

08:59.760 --> 09:04.120
It helps to look for the good
in surprises. Wanna try?

09:04.240 --> 09:07.199
What else is good about this rainstorm?

yummy South African doughnuts!
