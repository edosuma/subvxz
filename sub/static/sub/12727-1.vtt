01:24.251 --> 01:25.673
(sighs)

02:18.180 --> 02:19.682
(howling in distance)

02:25.395 --> 02:26.817
(inhales deeply)

02:33.904 --> 02:35.326
(roaring in distance)

02:43.914 --> 02:45.416
(sighs)

02:45.499 --> 02:47.501
I have dogs bigger than that.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.588
I thought you said
there were panthers here.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.595
I ain't seen a panther
in these mountains for nine years.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.055
Then what about the carcass
Snipes found up in Noland?

03:00.138 --> 03:02.812
- Something mauled that.
- That weren't no panther.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.853
The chest weren't tore open.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.604
They eat the heart first.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.194
You find me an honest-to-God panther
to hunt

03:13.276 --> 03:15.495
and I'll give you a $20 gold piece.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.871
If there's a panther still around,
it's likely touched by the devil.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.327
May end up hunting you.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.291
Well, I want one.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.386
(grunts)

03:43.557 --> 03:45.980
Vaughn. Would you have the girl
bring me my meal?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.324
(church bell tolling)

04:36.318 --> 04:38.320
(man 1) Coming down!
(man 2) Stand clear!

04:39.070 --> 04:41.198
(man 1) Timber!

04:44.326 --> 04:46.203
(indistinct conversations)

04:57.088 --> 04:58.135
George!

04:58.465 --> 05:00.263
All right, bring her around.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.262
Albert! What are you doing out here?

05:04.346 --> 05:06.440
Well, a letter came from the bank.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.650
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

05:13.522 --> 05:16.651
Look, you're going to have to
renegotiate the loan.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.019
I'll go up to Boston next week
and settle it. Don't fret.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.290
(man) Get it up! Come on.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.846
- My uncle's a partner. Don't forget.
- That's right but still.

05:26.868 --> 05:30.088
See, if we go up the north ridge
and we carry it all the way down...

05:31.164 --> 05:32.211
(grunts)

05:34.125 --> 05:35.251
(man screaming)

05:40.382 --> 05:41.884
(man) Get it off!

05:42.175 --> 05:43.597
(groaning)

05:45.011 --> 05:48.106
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

05:48.181 --> 05:49.603
(brakes squealing)

06:09.327 --> 06:14.083
Rumour has it that Congress is creating
a national park in Carolina.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.967
Well, the park may come.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.380
By the time the government takes
the land,

06:19.462 --> 06:20.884
there won't be a tree standing.

06:20.964 --> 06:24.594
The trouble is, George,
with this recent market crash,

06:24.718 --> 06:28.018
I'm afraid your stocks are no longer
sufficient collateral

06:28.096 --> 06:30.098
for us to roll a loan over.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.938
I mean, all my capital
is wrapped up in Carolina.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.988
What about this land in Brazil?

06:38.607 --> 06:40.075
I'd rather not touch that.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.449
(applause)

06:44.571 --> 06:46.494
You should have married Peg Lowell
when you had the chance.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.854
Then you wouldn't have to bow
and scrape for your bankers.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.832
Well, you're up on the news, aren't you?

06:50.911 --> 06:53.790
I am. That's why you should
talk to your sister more often.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.796
- I came to visit you this week.
- Once.

06:56.875 --> 06:57.967
In how long?

06:59.878 --> 07:01.801
I don't know what you're doing
tearing down that mountain,

07:01.880 --> 07:03.848
God knows where, and for what?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.143
Why can't you ever do anything sensible?

07:06.676 --> 07:08.553
I'm doing quite well, thank you.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.226
- Will there be anything else?
- No, thank you.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.993
(applause)

07:30.659 --> 07:34.630
That woman you're slavering over
is practically an aborigine, you know.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.797
Raised on a timber camp.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.592
A timber camp?

07:39.668 --> 07:41.716
Yes, I thought you'd like that.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.181
Unfortunately, it burned down
and killed her whole family.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.010
And two days after the fire,

07:49.094 --> 07:51.347
a rescue party found Serena
wandering in the ruins,

07:51.429 --> 07:53.272
calling for her dead brothers
and sisters.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.352
She was so covered in ash,
they thought she was a ghost.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.566
She is beautiful.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.198
Wounded.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.822
Mad for trees.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.957
(George) Hmm.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.619
It's a pity you don't stand a chance
with her.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.542
What are you doing?

09:44.834 --> 09:47.428
- I just wanted to say hello.
- (laughs) Well, hello.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.427
George Pemberton.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.972
Serena Shaw.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.653
I think we should be married.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.864
I can't wait to get there.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.432
Oh! Welcome back!

12:04.515 --> 12:05.732
- Splendid trip.
- Good!

12:05.808 --> 12:07.401
- I can't wait to fill you in.
- Yeah.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.070
I hope you didn't get all dolled up
on my account.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.362
Oh, no, no.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.037
- Hello.
- (Serena) Hello. (chuckles)

12:23.826 --> 12:25.078
(stammers) What...

12:25.203 --> 12:27.205
Well, what do you think of my wife?

12:27.288 --> 12:30.588
What? Why didn't you tell me?
I, you know...

12:31.209 --> 12:33.449
- Jesus, George! Why didn't you tell me?
- (both laughing)

12:33.461 --> 12:34.758
I would have, you know...

12:35.880 --> 12:37.553
This is Buchanan.
He's my right-hand man.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.392
- Serena Pemberton.
- Oh.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.012
Don't you know how to shake hands
properly, Mr. Buchanan?

12:42.136 --> 12:44.605
Well, of course I do.
I'm very happy to meet you.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.274
And, uh, well, welcome!

12:46.432 --> 12:47.979
So did Galloway find my panther yet?

12:48.059 --> 12:50.278
Well, a worker found some tracks
up on Laurel Creek

12:50.395 --> 12:52.193
but Galloway thinks that was a bobcat.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.866
- Are panthers common here?
- No, no, nothing to worry about.

12:54.941 --> 12:58.070
I mean, there's some question
as to whether there are any left at all.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.921
I was hoping to see my new home
before it gets dark.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.836
Yes, of course.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.678
- That girl...
- It doesn't matter.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.094
Our love began the day we met.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.064
Nothing that happened before
even exists.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.868
(engine stops)

13:45.533 --> 13:47.206
Keep your eyes closed.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.047
- Give me your hand.
(giggles)

13:51.497 --> 13:53.044
Step down. Watch your head.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.968
One more. One more.
Okay. Okay. Wait.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.722
On three, you can open your eyes.

13:59.797 --> 14:03.097
One, two, three.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.597
That's beautiful, George.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.316
And that's just the start.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.440
I bought an amazing property in Brazil.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.651
- Brazil?
- Yes.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.618
Virgin forest for hundreds of miles.
Mahogany.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.372
Raw and beautiful.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.795
Completely untouched.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.875
Can't find something like that
in America.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.717
You want that, don't you?

14:40.797 --> 14:42.344
More than anything.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.644
I never thought I'd find you.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.103
I never thought I'd find anyone.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.318
Really. You have no idea.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.378
Doc! Doc!

15:13.287 --> 15:14.334
Come on.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.670
(man wheezing in pain)

15:16.749 --> 15:19.593
(Campbell) Chaney!
Got ourselves another one.

15:19.669 --> 15:22.969
Ah, you're too late. There's nothing
I can do. Put him in the chair.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.555
(George) Rattlesnake?

15:26.634 --> 15:28.386
(Buchanan) Yeah,
it's gotten worse since you left.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.721
The crews get spooked and fall behind.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.602
We've lost six men
in the last two months.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.103
Shit.

15:34.016 --> 15:37.611
In Colorado, we had a trained eagle
to keep the snakes under control.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.363
Right. Well, I don't think
you'll find any eagles in Carolina,
Mrs. Pemberton.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.574
Well, we should import one.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.860
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, we should import one. Why not?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.044
(man continues wheezing)

15:57.832 --> 16:02.053
So I understand you have
some experience in the lumber
business, Mrs. Pemberton?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.506
My father had 40,000 acres in Colorado.

16:04.589 --> 16:05.886
Had?

16:06.340 --> 16:08.934
I do hope he didn't lose them
in this awful crash.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.266
He died.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.436
(George) Her father was
a first-rate timber man, Dr. Chaney.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.397
He had her riding the slope
before she could walk.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.572
Well, that gives you
the advantage over us, Mrs. Pemberton.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.366
I sure would like to
know what you think
of our little operation here.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.448
Aside from our obvious lack
of an eagle, that is.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.995
(all laughing)

16:28.988 --> 16:32.037
I think you've taken nine months
to do about six months' work.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.370
But a few changes should greatly
increase profitability.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.914
What did you find, a wife or a partner?

16:39.332 --> 16:40.424
Both.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.091
I suppose Mrs. Buchanan
takes no interest in your work?

16:44.795 --> 16:46.388
Oh, I'm a bachelor.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.767
I can assure you, Mr. Buchanan,

16:49.842 --> 16:52.265
I didn't come to Carolina
to do needlepoint.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.938
Of course not.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.526
She is a pistol.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.125
Buchanan's a funny one, isn't he?

17:17.036 --> 17:20.210
He seems a little bit, I don't know,

17:21.123 --> 17:22.625
too fond of you.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.967
What do you mean?

17:32.468 --> 17:33.970
He'll loosen up.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.639
Yeah.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.536
(moaning softly)

18:16.929 --> 18:18.556
- Good morning.
- (all) Good morning.

18:21.851 --> 18:26.027
Mrs. Pemberton's father owned
the Vulcan Lumber Company in Colorado.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.783
And she's equal to any man here.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.864
I expect you to follow her orders

18:34.905 --> 18:38.626
the same way you follow mine
or Mr. Campbell or Mr. Buchanan's.

18:41.912 --> 18:44.381
And she'll take no quarter
and she'll expect none.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.262
You'll soon see the truth of that.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.967
Good day.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.050
- Good morning.
- (all) Good morning.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.135
(Campbell) Come on, now.
Let's get to it.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.892
The trees ain't gonna
cut themselves, boys.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.473
(clicks tongue)

19:22.244 --> 19:24.838
- Mrs. Pemberton.
- Campbell.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.125
How's everything going?

19:27.750 --> 19:30.094
Well, good as can be expected, ma'am.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.681
(Serena) Don't notch so high!

19:34.632 --> 19:36.475
You're wasting a foot of timber.

19:36.592 --> 19:41.018
Any lower won't fall clear, ma'am.
Yonder's in the way.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.099
Give me your axe.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.276
- Ma'am?
- You heard me.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.662
- It'll clear.
- Ma'am.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.169
What do you think?

20:12.795 --> 20:14.217
She'll clear.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.632
(Serena) Get back to work.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.806
Who's that man up there?

20:19.885 --> 20:22.058
His name is Galloway, ma'am.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.982
- He seems standoffish.
- He is.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.480
He's the best hunting guide
in over a hundred miles.

20:27.518 --> 20:31.148
Track a grasshopper on a cap rock.
He say he has a gift of visioning.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.862
Whatever that is, I don't know.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.078
Mr. Galloway.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.994
Serena Pemberton.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.586
You were in prison.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.846
Why?

20:56.881 --> 20:58.599
Manslaughter.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.096
He had it coming.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.518
(man) Stand back, now.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.779
(man 1) Timber!
(man 2) Tree down!

21:18.694 --> 21:22.915
<i>(Kephart) Our Smoky Mountains contain
the last virgin forests</i>

21:23.032 --> 21:25.626
<i>in the eastern United States.</i>

21:26.535 --> 21:29.288
But with every passing year,
we're losing 'em

21:30.748 --> 21:33.627
to the cut-and-run philosophy
of the logging barons.

21:35.878 --> 21:40.805
But we're fools if we think
that what God has created

21:40.883 --> 21:43.557
can be sacrificed for a quick profit.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.311
The simple question before us is this,
ladies and gentlemen.

21:49.225 --> 21:53.731
Do we want our Smoky Mountains
to be made a national park?

21:54.730 --> 21:57.108
Or do we want them to be made a desert?

21:57.441 --> 21:58.784
(men murmuring)

21:58.901 --> 22:00.244
(applause)

22:01.904 --> 22:04.999
Thank you, Mr. Kephart.
And thank you all for
showing up this afternoon.

22:05.074 --> 22:07.918
- (George) What about the jobs, Sheriff?
- (men agreeing)

22:07.993 --> 22:09.620
These men need to work, don't they?

22:11.622 --> 22:13.942
And the logging camps bring
in railroads and electric lines

22:13.999 --> 22:15.751
to places that never had them before.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.587
We're bringing progress to Carolina.

22:17.628 --> 22:20.598
Progress? Progress for whom,
Mr. Pemberton?

22:21.257 --> 22:22.930
All the profits are going north.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.432
Well, what is it
that your park's providing?

22:25.469 --> 22:27.813
I'm sure your park
will be very nice for you

22:27.930 --> 22:30.353
and your rich friends to go
on a Sunday afternoon hike

22:30.432 --> 22:32.981
but for the working men,
the men in this room, Sheriff,

22:33.102 --> 22:37.448
the men unlike you, Mr. Kephart,
it's a matter of survival.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.157
He's right, Sheriff.

22:39.275 --> 22:43.121
The logging barons always cry "jobs"
and "free enterprise"

22:43.195 --> 22:47.291
but the truth is,
you barely pay enough
to put food on the table.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.787
Oh, we pay more than
any job these men can get.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.550
And that's why there's a line 50-deep
every time there's an opening.

22:53.664 --> 22:57.385
Openings. Yes, you always have openings,
don't you, Mr. Pemberton?

22:57.459 --> 23:01.805
Because your camps
have killed more men than
the War Between the States.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.471
(George) It's dangerous work.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.644
And every logger will tell you
he's proud of what he does.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.319
And I don't think he wants
the government

23:08.345 --> 23:09.972
to build him a pretty park, Sheriff.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.728
I think he wants the freedom.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.059
(crowd agreeing)

23:13.142 --> 23:17.147
The freedom to work hard
and to better himself.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.153
That's what this country
is supposed to be about, Sheriff!

23:20.232 --> 23:22.985
(man 1) Yeah! That's right!
(man 2) Yeah! Yeah!

23:25.696 --> 23:28.996
- You did wonderfully.
- Just told the truth.

23:30.159 --> 23:33.663
One, two, three, smile! And flash!

23:35.664 --> 23:37.041
(footsteps approaching)

23:42.671 --> 23:44.173
I love you so much.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.771
I have your child inside me.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.377
(George laughing)

24:48.904 --> 24:50.906
<i>- Namaste.
- Namaste.</i>

24:56.453 --> 24:57.500
Vaughn!

24:58.789 --> 25:01.309
Put my horse in the stable.
They need to get used to each other.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.926
Yes, ma'am.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.102
- I'll get you some food and blankets.
- Don't bother.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.309
I won't eat or sleep until she does.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.524
- Well, I'm staying here with you.
- No, you're not.

25:16.598 --> 25:17.815
I need to do this alone.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.608
They need to know that it was a woman
who tamed the eagle.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.155
(George) All right. Everybody out.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.803
Hi.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.530
The prey believes that
if it keeps still, it won't be noticed.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.817
But eventually it flinches.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.327
And when it does,

26:11.403 --> 26:12.871
the eagle always sees.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.543
This, uh, park business
seems to be picking up speed.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.254
Now that Rockefeller's
thrown in with them,
they're making real offers.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.590
- They'll be coming to us next?
- Yeah.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.381
Rockefeller's $5 million behind them.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.087
We're not interested.

26:28.170 --> 26:31.219
Well, I was asking your husband's
opinion, Mrs. Pemberton, not yours.

26:31.340 --> 26:32.432
Easy.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.065
Well, I don't want you
to worry about it.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.733
Well, I do.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.492
We'll need about a million
to pay off the loan

27:32.568 --> 27:34.991
and have enough money
to get going in Brazil.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.630
That's two more years here in Carolina,

27:36.655 --> 27:39.078
assuming this park business
doesn't shut <i>us</i> down.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.993
We're going to have to
pay off a senator.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.622
Listen. What do you think of Serena?

27:47.416 --> 27:49.760
Oh, well, she's a lovely girl.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.467
I'm sorry. I should have
said something to you earlier.

27:52.588 --> 27:53.965
But Serena is different, you know.

27:54.631 --> 27:58.010
She'd rather come to a godforsaken place
like Carolina

27:59.261 --> 28:01.104
than sip tea with society ladies.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.522
Can you imagine a woman like that?

28:05.601 --> 28:09.697
Well, I don't have to imagine her,
George. She's right here with us.

28:11.315 --> 28:12.942
I just don't want you to think of her
as my wife.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.993
I want you to think of her as a partner.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.612
Because she is.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.030
A partner.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.000
- Every cent she has, she gave to us.
- Right.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.121
Well, I will indeed. A partner.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.151
(lock clicks)

28:50.187 --> 28:52.485
- Good morning, Sheriff.
- Ladies.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.207
(Buchanan) So, this is for you, Senator.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.167
- You have a nice campaign, now.
- I will.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.328
Good day, Mr. Buchanan.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.883
Does Mr Pemberton think bribes
can stop the park?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.878
Oh, well, nothing wrong
with having friends in high places.

29:14.836 --> 29:18.181
I'm surprised Mrs. Pemberton
isn't handling the bribery by now.

29:19.341 --> 29:22.185
I hear she's taken charge
of everything else at the camp.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.847
I understand why
you might think so, Sheriff.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.232
But you don't really know.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.189
We'd like to make you a proposition.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.294
- Sheriff McDowell.
- Buchanan.

29:51.373 --> 29:54.217
- (Buchanan) Welcome. How are you today?
- Good. Thank you.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.715
Good. Good to see you.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.046
Mr. Kephart.

29:57.087 --> 29:58.555
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

29:58.588 --> 29:59.885
- How are you?
- All right.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.391
They seem chummy.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.724
Has Buchanan ever done business
for them before?

30:05.220 --> 30:06.563
Not that I know of.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.230
This is your offer, then?

30:14.896 --> 30:16.569
$400,000.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.401
That's a good deal more
than you'd get on the open
market, Mr. Pemberton.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.781
Well, maybe that's true, Mr Kephart.

30:20.902 --> 30:23.496
But we're asking
for a million dollars firm, so...

30:27.409 --> 30:29.582
The land was appraised at 300.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.088
Before the crash.

30:36.084 --> 30:39.930
Well, I am very sorry
to have wasted your time today,
gentlemen but, um,

30:41.757 --> 30:42.758
we were all under the assumption

30:42.841 --> 30:45.014
that you were coming to us
with a formidable offer.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.437
If we have to take this land
by eminent domain,

30:47.512 --> 30:49.310
you'll be lucky to get a half
of what we're offering.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.980
- Is that a threat, Sheriff?
- No, no, it's a fact.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.024
Gentlemen, gentlemen, uh,
why don't we all, um,

30:55.103 --> 30:56.480
reconsider our positions

30:56.605 --> 30:59.108
and convene whenever
the Pembertons
and I have looked through...

30:59.191 --> 31:01.193
(George) The fact is, Sheriff,

31:02.694 --> 31:04.867
you need our land to build your park.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.287
And our price is a million dollars.

31:07.324 --> 31:08.871
Well, think a second time.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.796
Because one false step
and those bankers you're in hock to

31:12.829 --> 31:14.672
will be picking on the bones
of your fortune.

31:14.790 --> 31:18.294
And I personally would hate to see
your pretty wife humiliated in that way.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.304
You don't ever get to talk about wife,
let alone look at her.

31:21.463 --> 31:22.885
You can leave now.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.679
(McDowell) Good day. Good day, ma'am.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.657
- How are you, Mr. Galloway?
- Well, Mr. Pemberton.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.661
(engine sputtering)

31:59.918 --> 32:02.341
I thought you were coming with us?
Galloway's got a line on a panther.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.261
Oh. I'm afraid not.
I've got business in Asheville.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.843
- On a Sunday?
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.190
(Galloway) Bobcat.

32:22.107 --> 32:25.361
But, um, that ain't what you want,
is it, Mr. Pemberton?

32:25.444 --> 32:26.946
No, it's not.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.781
Next time, we come at nightfall.

32:29.865 --> 32:32.368
If there's a panther roundabout,
you'll hear it.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.921
You know that, uh,

32:38.123 --> 32:40.717
that park agitator, Kephart?

32:40.792 --> 32:42.544
He has a cabin here.
Do you know where that is?

32:42.586 --> 32:44.054
I reckon I do.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.716
I'd like to take a look.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.023
I went by Kephart's cabin.

34:25.981 --> 34:28.530
I, uh... Yeah, I've been negotiating
with them.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.493
- Behind my back.
- Yeah. Well, look. Listen.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.495
Listen, they'll go <i>as</i> high as 450 now.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.953
You said a million.
That's what you always said.

34:37.324 --> 34:39.364
George, you're going to have to forget
about Brazil.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.998
That's...

34:50.130 --> 34:51.723
You're not the same any more.

34:53.632 --> 34:55.385
The only thing that's changed is you.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.225
Look. I just want out.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.023
I'll buy you out
<i>as</i> soon as we move to Brazil.

35:08.523 --> 35:09.900
Oh, I'm afraid I can't wait that long.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.995
Well, I'm not going to sell, Albert,
so you can't do anything about it.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.030
That's the agreement, till I sell.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.241
You know what?
I'll tell them about the bribes.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.537
- Go ahead. You're as guilty as I am.
- No.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.883
You're going to take the fall, George.
I get a deal if I testify.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.545
I've had that arranged.

35:31.254 --> 35:34.383
You're going to go to prison.
That's what's going to happen.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.606
You're a son of a bitch.

35:46.561 --> 35:49.531
It's so obvious now. My friend?
He was never my friend.

35:51.232 --> 35:53.405
He'd come here and threaten me
in my home?

35:53.943 --> 35:55.945
What we've built?
What I promised you, Serena?

35:56.071 --> 35:57.414
What I've promised you!

35:57.947 --> 35:59.745
How did we lose Brazil, George?

36:00.617 --> 36:02.085
I don't understand.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.420
Well, I had to put the land up
as collateral,

36:04.537 --> 36:06.756
otherwise the bank wouldn't
roll over the loan.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.794
Because that's what he's doing.
He's going to make us sell

36:10.919 --> 36:12.421
and we're going to lose it, Serena,
everything.

36:12.462 --> 36:15.591
Our future.
Everything that we talked about.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.767
Why didn't you tell me about the land?

36:17.801 --> 36:19.599
Well, I didn't think
that it would matter.

36:19.719 --> 36:23.064
How was I supposed to
know that he was doing back-door
deals with Kephart?

36:23.723 --> 36:26.602
We promised
to tell each other everything.

36:26.726 --> 36:27.898
(George sighs)

36:30.271 --> 36:33.491
- I didn't want to frighten you.
- I'm not that kind of woman.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.575
The only thing that frightens me
is the thought that you don't trust me.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.291
I'm sorry.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.586
I told you what he was
on the first night, George.

36:44.619 --> 36:47.623
He's jealous of me.
He's trying to destroy what we have.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.444
Well, we're running out of time.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.255
He said he's already
making up the paperwork.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.135
Then we have a real problem.

36:54.087 --> 36:56.340
I go to prison, it'll be over for us.

36:58.466 --> 36:59.934
Then solve it.

37:02.512 --> 37:06.858
He betrayed you, George.
He was never your friend.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.716
(dogs barking)

38:22.383 --> 38:24.431
(Galloway) Keep the horses back,
Campbell.

38:26.262 --> 38:27.354
You hear me, boys?

38:27.388 --> 38:30.562
Let Mr. Pemberton and Mr. Buchanan
set up on the orchard.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.398
(man) Come on. Get! Come on, now.

38:39.609 --> 38:42.237
(Galloway) The bear's hunkered down
in them trees, Mr. Pemberton.

38:42.362 --> 38:45.206
- Dogs will flush him out in no time.
- Thanks, Mr. Galloway.

38:45.907 --> 38:49.252
(man) Get, get! Come on.
Go get him. Come on.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.384
(Buchanan) Did Serena
take the news well?

39:00.255 --> 39:03.259
Yeah, well, she's handled worse
than this, hasn't she?

39:03.466 --> 39:06.561
Keeps her pride.
No matter what other people say.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.800
(dogs barking in distance)

39:59.522 --> 40:00.990
(roaring in distance)

40:08.781 --> 40:10.158
(bear roars)

40:15.455 --> 40:17.002
Well, did you see that?

40:18.374 --> 40:19.842
What...

40:21.836 --> 40:23.304
(stammers)

40:30.386 --> 40:31.512
(cocks gun)

40:48.363 --> 40:49.865
(cocks gun)

41:07.715 --> 41:09.217
Help!

41:13.721 --> 41:15.098
(dogs barking in distance)

41:17.058 --> 41:18.401
Come on! Help me get him!

41:18.518 --> 41:21.237
(man) We need help over here!
We got a man down!

41:32.448 --> 41:35.122
- (McDowell) Chaney...
- One shot. Rifle.

41:46.462 --> 41:47.930
(George) Sheriff.

41:48.297 --> 41:51.471
We were set up on the same line
and the bear had come in between us

41:51.592 --> 41:54.311
and by the time it had crossed through,
he was in my crosshairs.

41:59.892 --> 42:01.439
Anyone with you?

42:03.229 --> 42:04.276
No.

42:15.116 --> 42:16.789
You see anything, Campbell?

42:27.503 --> 42:29.471
No, I didn't see nothing, Sheriff.

42:36.637 --> 42:40.642
Well, looks like your shot hit
dead centre of his heart.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.477
Pretty amazing accident.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.022
You and Buchanan got on, did you?

42:47.482 --> 42:49.029
He was my best friend.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.819
Take the body downtown.

42:51.861 --> 42:53.829
I'm going to have an autopsy done.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.836
You got anything to add?

43:03.372 --> 43:04.874
It was an accident.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.635
How do you know that?

43:10.004 --> 43:12.473
He ain't a good enough shot
to do it on purpose.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.557
Anything else, Sheriff?

43:18.888 --> 43:20.686
Not today, Mr. Pemberton.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.192
Not today.

43:30.525 --> 43:32.368
I had decided not to...

43:39.033 --> 43:40.876
But then he turned around.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.831
I wish I could have been beside you.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.716
He was never your friend.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.882
He betrayed you, George.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.096
You don't understand.

44:01.097 --> 44:04.442
Everything you did, you did for us.

44:05.518 --> 44:06.895
For our future.

44:35.756 --> 44:37.258
Come in.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.766
- Uh, Mr. Buchanan's things.
- Ah.

44:50.771 --> 44:52.648
The coroner agreed it was an accident.

44:52.982 --> 44:54.484
Wrote it in the report.

44:55.109 --> 44:56.577
(footsteps receding)

45:06.287 --> 45:07.789
(sighs)

46:19.527 --> 46:21.325
(Serena) I love you so much.

46:42.258 --> 46:43.851
(baby crying)

46:44.051 --> 46:45.553
Thank you, sir.

46:45.886 --> 46:47.559
Oh! Come on.

46:53.436 --> 46:55.234
Four. So, 41.

46:59.567 --> 47:01.240
(baby continues crying)

47:12.413 --> 47:13.881
(water splashing)

47:25.968 --> 47:27.766
Does my scar bother you?

47:29.555 --> 47:30.932
Of course not.

47:34.810 --> 47:36.562
Whatever happened in that fire?

47:45.613 --> 47:47.115
I was 12.

47:52.119 --> 47:54.668
I used to sleep downstairs
because I would wake up early

47:54.789 --> 47:56.291
to take care of the horses.

47:56.832 --> 47:58.834
And I didn't want
to wake the little ones.

48:04.757 --> 48:06.304
That's how I got out in time.

48:11.972 --> 48:13.974
I knew they were still inside.

48:16.477 --> 48:18.320
But I just kept running.

48:24.819 --> 48:28.449
And I kept going until
I couldn't hear them
screaming any more.

48:35.037 --> 48:36.505
I was the oldest.

48:41.168 --> 48:42.841
They were screaming for me.

48:54.849 --> 48:56.817
You were only a child.

48:59.645 --> 49:03.570
After that day, I swore that
I would never love
anyone ever again.

49:08.404 --> 49:09.872
I can't lose you.

49:10.698 --> 49:12.166
You won't.

49:15.327 --> 49:16.874
Ever.

49:28.424 --> 49:29.516
What is it?

49:31.093 --> 49:33.892
Rachel Hermann has come.
She's looking for her old job back.

49:35.264 --> 49:36.561
Well, where is she?

49:36.682 --> 49:38.355
Over in the chapel.

49:38.392 --> 49:41.737
But there ain't no work in this town,
not for a young lady of her kind.

49:42.229 --> 49:45.108
Widow Jenkins is kind of looking after
that boy of hers.

49:45.232 --> 49:47.312
If she don't get a job,
her and that boy will starve.

49:51.071 --> 49:54.746
We both know it wasn't
her fault that she got pregnant
out of wedlock, now.

50:25.064 --> 50:26.782
So you want your old job back?

50:27.316 --> 50:28.784
Yes, sir.

50:31.278 --> 50:33.781
- Well, you can start Monday.
- Yes, sir.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.998
The, uh, child. What's the child's name?

50:40.162 --> 50:42.961
Jacob. That's from the Bible.

50:48.796 --> 50:50.264
That's a beautiful name.

50:52.341 --> 50:53.809
Thank you.

50:56.804 --> 50:58.306
Monday.

51:02.101 --> 51:05.480
She knows that
she has no claim on us,
of course? Nor her child.

51:05.521 --> 51:06.818
No, she knows that, of course.

51:06.939 --> 51:08.191
Campbell just said that
there's no work in town

51:08.315 --> 51:09.755
and I don't want to let them starve.

51:10.526 --> 51:12.824
Does she intend to bring the child
to work with her?

51:12.945 --> 51:15.368
No, there's an old widow
that's going to take care of him.

51:16.824 --> 51:18.326
Him.

51:18.450 --> 51:21.169
- So it's a boy.
- Apparently.

51:23.163 --> 51:25.040
Look, it doesn't make
one difference to me.

51:25.457 --> 51:27.676
It's just I don't want them to struggle,
that's all.

51:27.793 --> 51:29.170
Nor do I.

51:41.682 --> 51:43.355
(whistle blows)

51:45.477 --> 51:48.196
(Galloway) All right, boys.
Break's over!

51:58.032 --> 51:59.500
Give me that.

52:02.995 --> 52:04.212
(inhales)

52:10.252 --> 52:11.378
Sorry.

52:32.733 --> 52:36.237
(photographer) Get his chin up.
Smile for me, Jacob.

52:36.362 --> 52:37.784
Big smile, now.

52:38.572 --> 52:41.075
That's it. Look at the birdie.

52:43.118 --> 52:45.246
And, uh, hold it there now.

52:45.371 --> 52:48.090
Can you get... Just raise him up
just a little bit higher, please?

52:49.375 --> 52:51.878
That's good. That's good.
Just hold him there, now.

52:51.919 --> 52:53.091
Okay. Jacob!

52:54.421 --> 52:56.890
- Come on, now.
- (Rachel) Come on, now.

52:56.924 --> 52:58.972
(photographer) Just look at me.

53:01.053 --> 53:03.602
Look at me please, Jacob. There you go.

53:03.639 --> 53:06.108
Smile for me, now! Smile!

53:08.143 --> 53:09.941
- And flash!
- (flash fires)

53:11.730 --> 53:13.323
Hold him still, miss.

53:25.619 --> 53:28.668
Look at the birdie!
And flash!

53:36.422 --> 53:37.969
(church bell tolling)

54:57.544 --> 54:58.761
(door opening)

55:03.258 --> 55:05.431
- You okay?
- Yes.

55:07.930 --> 55:09.398
Come feel.

55:10.516 --> 55:11.893
He's moving.

55:18.190 --> 55:19.567
Right here.

55:24.404 --> 55:26.202
Oh. Yeah.

55:29.076 --> 55:30.578
The first of our dozen.

55:33.580 --> 55:36.129
- You want me to take that?
- No, no, no!

55:36.250 --> 55:38.378
I got it, Mr. Vaughn. Thank you.

55:45.425 --> 55:47.427
It's perfect, George. He'll love it.

55:47.553 --> 55:50.056
- How do you know it's a boy?
- I just do.

55:50.556 --> 55:52.433
Well, maybe I'd like a girl.

55:52.975 --> 55:55.148
No. You're not getting one.

55:55.269 --> 55:57.442
- Is that right?
- Mmm-hmm.

56:00.399 --> 56:01.776
Thank you.

56:03.277 --> 56:04.837
- (whistle blowing)
- (man 1) Over here!

56:06.113 --> 56:07.285
(man 2) Pick it up, now.

56:10.784 --> 56:12.286
This one here.

56:26.300 --> 56:27.973
(screaming)

56:32.848 --> 56:34.816
Somebody give me a belt!
Give me your belt!

56:35.309 --> 56:36.526
(groaning)

56:40.814 --> 56:42.282
(screams)

56:43.442 --> 56:45.285
(Serena) It's okay.
It's okay.

56:46.153 --> 56:47.279
Get him on the car.

56:49.865 --> 56:51.708
Campbell!
Chaney!

56:52.618 --> 56:54.165
Load him up in the truck!

56:56.163 --> 56:57.665
Campbell, go with him.

56:58.123 --> 57:00.046
Get him in the van.
Come on, get in the truck.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.003
Turn him around. Come on. I got him!

57:06.048 --> 57:07.345
I'll live.

57:07.466 --> 57:09.139
It's done been prophesied.

57:13.889 --> 57:16.017
Damn fine job,
whoever tied that tourniquet.

57:16.058 --> 57:17.901
He would have bled out otherwise.

57:22.564 --> 57:24.191
Did you do that?

57:24.858 --> 57:26.201
Yes.

57:33.033 --> 57:34.876
- Were you riding a horse?
- Uh-huh.

57:35.827 --> 57:37.204
(groaning)

57:38.830 --> 57:41.754
Most likely something hasn't
lain right on your stomach.

57:42.376 --> 57:44.096
It really does not feel
like a stomach-ache.

57:44.211 --> 57:46.430
Well, it certainly isn't labour.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.177
Now, the hospital at Asheville

57:48.215 --> 57:51.344
can give you a second opinion,
if the discomfort is too much for you.

57:51.385 --> 57:52.682
Well, let's go there, then.

57:52.886 --> 57:54.513
<i>That's not necessary.</i>

57:55.180 --> 57:57.228
- Mmm-hmm. All right.
- (George) Bye.

58:01.770 --> 58:03.363
(door closes)

58:04.731 --> 58:06.233
(groaning)

58:08.068 --> 58:10.446
<i>- I'll</i> get the doctor.
- No, George. George.

58:11.530 --> 58:12.907
(breathing heavily)

58:17.077 --> 58:18.454
(sighs)

58:19.079 --> 58:21.081
I just want to try
to go to sleep.

58:21.748 --> 58:22.965
All right.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.425
You sure you don't want to
go to the hospital?

58:24.459 --> 58:25.551
Yeah.

58:26.086 --> 58:28.054
I'll feel better in the morning.

58:31.091 --> 58:32.468
I love you.

58:32.968 --> 58:34.595
I love you, too.

58:46.148 --> 58:47.400
(Serena moaning)

58:47.441 --> 58:48.909
Campbell!

58:49.776 --> 58:51.153
(dogs howling)

58:52.112 --> 58:53.580
Campbell!

58:58.326 --> 58:59.418
- (Serena groans)
- Oh, God.

59:03.123 --> 59:04.625
(screaming)

59:10.088 --> 59:12.637
- She's going to need more blood.
- (George) Use mine.

59:29.149 --> 59:30.822
(sighs) It's going to be okay.

59:34.946 --> 59:36.994
You're going to be fine.

59:45.791 --> 59:47.168
(door opens)

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:04.188
(door closes)

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:27.212
The child is dead?

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.211
Yes.

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:34.347
A boy?

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:38.718
(George breathes deeply)

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:44.767
What?

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:47.561
What?

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:53.192
We won't be able to have another.

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:13.484
Take a warm bath
and I'll get the rest of the things.

01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:18.194
- Get rid of it!
- What? What?

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:21.527
- Get rid of it! Get rid of it now!
- Okay, I'll...

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.346
(door closes)

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.097
(grunting)

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:16.778
(knocking)

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:37.290
I need to see your missus.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:40.794
Well, she's resting now.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:43.005
I can wait.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:47.134
What for?

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:51.100
The day I was born, my mama had a vision

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.981
that I would lose much
but be saved by a woman.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.148
Your missus <i>is</i>
the one from that prophecy.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:03.150
And I'm honour-bound to her.

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:13.001
(lock clicking)

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:24.509
(men talking in distance)

01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:26.677
(men grunting)

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:28.220
(axes chopping)

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:17.099
(sighs)

01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:31.259
Mr. Pemberton!

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.141
(George) What is it?
We're about to leave.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.353
Uh, payday.

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.141
Need you to come open the safe.

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:41.475
Here, you do it.

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:43.893
- Don't forget to bring the key back.
- Thank you.

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.904
Watch your head.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.484
Okay.

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:48.879
You'll have to testify to what you saw.

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:50.676
And what you did.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:52.383
I can't promise you won't do time.

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:53.966
Don't have to.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.809
I fully understand the consequences
of my actions.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:03.018
There's a judge in Raleigh
you can show these to.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:05.149
One they don't own yet.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.693
You sure you still want to
go through with this?

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.395
You want me to take 'em?

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:29.086
You look stunning.

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:32.923
Thank you.

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:41.185
Everything's going to be all right.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:43.345
I know.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.729
We're going to go downstairs
and we're going to
eat and dance and...

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:51.067
We're going to forget about
everything but each other.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.951
- I won't be long.
- Okay.

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:08.375
(door closes)

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:42.489
(♫ man singing Bye Bye Blackbird)

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:55.418
(Calhoun) What level of investment
do you require?

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:57.003
(laughs) What's this, George?

01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:59.680
This is my lovely wife.
This is Mr. Lowenstein.

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:02.349
The woman who tames eagles.

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.348
- Your reputation precedes you.
- (laughs)

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:06.688
Now, this is Mr. Calhoun.
These two gentlemen are...

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:08.314
(laughing)

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.021
(sighs)

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:16.189
Serena.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.489
I want to dance.

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:19.275
These gentlemen are interested
in investing in Brazil.

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.861
But I love this song
and I really want to dance.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:23.863
I think you should sit down.

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:26.207
- Will you dance with me, Mr. Lowenstein?
- No, that's not a good idea.

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:27.826
- Don't...
- Well, uh...

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:30.002
Of course, I'd be delighted to,
Mrs. Pemberton.

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:31.879
But I...

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.884
It's fine. Fine.

01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:38.845
Thank you.

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:42.052
My husband is apparently
too busy to dance with me.

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:02.702
(both moaning)

01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:34.025
Campbell's gone missing.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.353
You might want to check the safe.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:44.277
He took the ledgers.

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:49.407
(sighs)

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.963
He can destroy us, George.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:57.256
Just like Buchanan.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:19.441
(humming)

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:44.303
Hmm?
Hmm?

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:47.928
(continues humming)

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.516
(woman humming)

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:45.654
♫ Your daddy is a loving working man...

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.243
I know where Campbell is.

01:14:57.702 --> 01:14:59.079
Good.

01:15:26.564 --> 01:15:27.861
Locking yourself in?

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:32.286
I saw some tracks by the falls.

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:34.701
Looks like a panther.

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:38.788
Let me know when you want to kill it.

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:37.351
(indistinct conversations)

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:39.201
(Galloway) Mr. Campbell?

01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:17.910
(sobbing)

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:47.974
(screaming)

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.104
(gasps)

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:00.153
(screaming)

01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:04.995
Get out!
Get out!

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:12.131
(Campbell coughs)

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:16.594
(gurgling)

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:20.236
(cocking gun)

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:30.166
Vaughn?

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:37.424
Mr. Pemberton's going
to be very hungry
when he gets home.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:38.884
Have cook make up all of his favourites

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:40.919
and bring them to the cabin
when he gets back.

01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:42.838
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.440
(men talking in distance)

01:21:12.242 --> 01:21:13.789
Here's your supper.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.964
I have some business to go take care of.

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:22.423
I'm doing this for us, George.

01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:24.634
For our new world.

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:27.091
What are you talking about?

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:29.434
Brazil, of course.

01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:32.309
We're going to be so happy there.

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.653
(door closes)

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:41.780
(engine starts)

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.168
(breathing deeply)

01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:21.186
Give me the Sheriff. Quick!

01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:32.198
(Galloway) Rachel stays with
the widow Jenkins sometimes.

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:33.703
It ain't far.

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:39.038
(doors closing)

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:21.213
Mrs. Jenkins?

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:23.249
It's Sheriff McDowell.

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:28.512
Mrs. Jenkins?

01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:49.779
We gotta get you out of here.

01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:56.706
Is she all right?

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:21.728
- Mrs. Sloan.
- Come on in. Come on.

01:24:23.809 --> 01:24:25.277
(knocking on door)

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:46.001
What can I do for you, Sheriff?

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:49.259
There was a murder
up on Colt Ridge last night.

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:51.007
Widow named Jenkins.

01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:54.347
Never hurt a soul.
Somebody slashed her throat.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.512
And, uh...

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.683
why are you telling me?

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:02.310
I'd like to speak to your wife,
if you don't mind.

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:05.604
My wife?

01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:08.028
She's not in there.

01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:11.528
She went out with the cutting crew
earlier this morning.

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:13.692
That's convenient.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.865
You happen to know
where she and that mongrel of
hers were last night?

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:22.330
I know she had nothing to do
with some old woman's murder.

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:28.374
Well, that woman was looking
after Rachel Hermann's boy.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:36.715
Is the child all right?

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.635
Ask your wife.

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:46.896
I don't need to.

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:53.569
You make no mistake.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:56.034
They were coming for your boy.

01:25:57.569 --> 01:26:00.038
Galloway slit Campbell's throat
the other day.

01:26:01.073 --> 01:26:02.746
Your boy was next.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:06.704
Expect your wife
can tell you why,
Mr. Pemberton.

01:26:16.713 --> 01:26:18.090
(car door closes)

01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:19.845
(car drives away)

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.771
Tell me you didn't do it.

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:16.735
Tell me you didn't send Galloway.

01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:20.615
It's okay, George.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:30.120
It's okay.

01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:32.836
It had to be done.

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:35.167
For us.

01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:46.762
What had to be done?

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:52.776
You hurt me.

01:27:54.644 --> 01:27:56.863
You said that
I was enough for you.

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:03.369
You are enough for me.

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:05.864
You're lying.

01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:10.707
I found the picture of your baby.

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:16.504
Our love is more important
than that child, isn't it?

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:22.055
Isn't it, George?

01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:29.517
You just tell me where Galloway is.

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:31.982
- Just tell me where he is.
- No, come on. No...

01:28:32.057 --> 01:28:33.400
- It'll all be over.
- No.

01:28:33.517 --> 01:28:34.894
- Just tell me. Just...
- No.

01:28:36.853 --> 01:28:39.402
It'll never be over
as long as that child is alive.

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:42.576
No, please... No...

01:28:42.818 --> 01:28:46.493
You'll never be free of him.
Can't you see?
He looks just like you.

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:48.741
I had to.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:51.247
Just let the child go!

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:54.087
George. Stop.

01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:55.922
George!

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:58.445
If you love your bastard child
as much, then just kill me.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.600
That's the only way you'll ever stop me.

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:07.267
(coughs)

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:12.348
(choking)

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:28.575
(gasping)

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:51.728
(coughing)

01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:22.133
(car engine starts)

01:30:26.129 --> 01:30:27.597
(car driving away)

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:29.405
Where did you send Rachel and the boy?

01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:31.866
That's a matter for the law.

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:34.744
This is everything you need
to put me away forever.

01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:37.372
And what's that supposed to mean?

01:31:37.826 --> 01:31:39.874
It means that I'm turning myself in.

01:31:40.537 --> 01:31:42.084
You just tell me where they are

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:44.165
and when I get back,
you'll have your arrest.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.172
I don't need your help.

01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:51.093
Do you know that Galloway never
came back to the camp last night?

01:31:51.214 --> 01:31:53.091
I'll contact Rachel.
Tell her to move on.

01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:55.093
He is going to find them, Sheriff.

01:31:55.135 --> 01:31:56.808
You know that <i>as</i> well as I do.

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:59.602
And what do you propose
to do about that?

01:32:01.933 --> 01:32:03.901
Tell me where they are.

01:32:06.146 --> 01:32:07.944
That's my boy, Sheriff.

01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:12.782
(crowd murmuring)

01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:23.121
- (Mrs. Sloan) So you'll be fine?
- Mmm.

01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:24.460
I'll be back soon.

01:32:25.415 --> 01:32:26.632
Bye-bye.

01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:29.461
Bye.

01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:37.018
(Rachel gasps)

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:48.814
Kingsport, Tennessee. Name of Sloan.

01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:52.196
You got 24 hours,
then I'm calling the judge.

01:32:58.948 --> 01:33:00.388
I need the next train to Washington.

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:02.960
There ain't one for another two hours.

01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:04.838
- There anything sooner?
- No.

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:06.356
- (baby crying)
- (Rachel shushing)

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.687
- (Jacob fussing)
- Shh, shh. Hush.

01:33:52.085 --> 01:33:53.086
(train whistle blowing)

01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:55.179
Shh.

01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:39.591
(inaudible)

01:34:59.944 --> 01:35:01.321
(baby crying)

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:07.160
(sobbing) Hush...

01:35:14.626 --> 01:35:16.173
(crying continues)

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:19.006
Please, no.

01:35:22.258 --> 01:35:23.805
Mr. Galloway...

01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:46.658
Stop.

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:23.536
It's okay.

01:36:34.706 --> 01:36:36.708
- You say he'll be hunting?
- Yes, sir.

01:36:37.375 --> 01:36:39.093
- Up in Noland.
- Hmm.

01:36:46.676 --> 01:36:48.053
Let's go.

01:36:53.266 --> 01:36:54.859
(train whistle blowing)

01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:58.571
(Rachel) I told him if he's real quiet,

01:36:59.439 --> 01:37:02.909
Joel'll give him some
more cars for his choo-choo
when we get there.

01:37:03.192 --> 01:37:04.284
(train approaching)

01:37:04.402 --> 01:37:05.574
Joel Vaughn?

01:37:05.945 --> 01:37:08.698
Yeah.
He's going to take care of us now.

01:37:09.282 --> 01:37:10.750
Jacob's real sweet on him.

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:25.974
You best say goodbye to him now.

01:37:36.142 --> 01:37:37.769
(babbling)

01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:33.157
(grunts)

01:39:44.437 --> 01:39:45.780
(man 1) Spread out, boys.

01:39:46.397 --> 01:39:47.774
(man 2) There, there.

01:39:47.899 --> 01:39:49.776
All right. All right, come on.

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:15.927
(growls)

01:40:24.602 --> 01:40:26.024
Son of a bitch.

01:41:02.807 --> 01:41:04.150
(car doors opening)

01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:23.536
Mrs. Pemberton!

01:41:23.661 --> 01:41:25.663
- (banging on door)
- Mrs. Pemberton?

01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:28.424
You need to come and identify.

01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:29.875
(continues banging)

01:41:30.001 --> 01:41:31.344
Mrs. Pemberton?

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:44.523
Mrs. Pemberton?

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:47.776
Mrs. Pemberton, you need to come out
and identify your next of kin.

01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:50.567
(exhales deeply)

01:41:54.692 --> 01:41:56.535
All right. Let's take him away, then.

01:41:57.028 --> 01:41:59.247
Come on, boys,
let's get back in the car.

01:42:01.574 --> 01:42:03.372
(car doors closing)

01:44:00.693 --> 01:44:02.570
(wood crackling)
