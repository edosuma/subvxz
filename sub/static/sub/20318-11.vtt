WEBVTT

00:07.880 --> 00:10.235
So what happened to him?
-He passed out.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.390
Any idea why?
-No.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.349
Sir?

00:14.840 --> 00:17.195
Well, his eyes are open.
He's conscious.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.398
Why is there a turkey
beside his head?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.914
I didn't have any frozen peas.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.117
You know, to use as a cold compress.
He bumped his head when he fell.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.758
Right, okay.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.115
Yes, that is a nasty bump.

00:34.760 --> 00:38.309
You lying, cheating, cheap bastard!

00:42.080 --> 00:45.516
Did you throw that turkey at
your husband's head, ma'am?

00:48.040 --> 00:49.393
It's organic.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.080
Come on, Toby.
-No, Oz, I got plans.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.678
I think after a myocardial
infarction, a slipped disc,

01:02.760 --> 01:05.479
and a frozen turkey attack, you'd at
least let me take you out for a beer.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.676
I promised Liv dinner and a movie.
-What movie?

01:07.760 --> 01:09.637
The one you're not going to.
-Wrap it up, boys.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.676
You guys are heading back out.
-Pardon me, sir?

01:11.760 --> 01:14.752
Number 22 has a 10-7 in Scarborough.
Tow truck rear-ended.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.671
Heaton and Mohan.
-How are they?

01:16.760 --> 01:18.318
Well, they're a lot happier
now that they know that

01:18.400 --> 01:20.356
you two are pulling a double
till they're up and running.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.715
Can't do it, sir.
-Yes, you can.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.677
Sir, Toby and I have
previous engagements tonight.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.354
Previous engagements? Not any more.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.989
Sir, you can't just put us on a double.
We do have a union.

01:31.920 --> 01:35.754
Protects us in these cases.
There's grievances we can file.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.872
Yeah, I don't think Ryder
appreciated that union threat.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.076
No, he did not.
-It was a nice try, though.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.479
Oh, thank you.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.034
Well, we got a fall. Possible
head injury at Dundas and Cox.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.031
All right.
-Here we go.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:00.280 --> 02:03.750
Hey. How you doing,
sir? Can you hear me?

02:03.840 --> 02:06.877
Okay, hold on. Look at me. I'm a paramedic.
We're gonna take care of you.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.597
Gonna kill her.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.590
Is it alcohol?
-No, no. I can't smell any.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.353
He's barely got a pulse, man.
-Heart attack or stroke?

02:15.440 --> 02:18.273
He's got massive head trauma.
We got to move him, Oz.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.271
You get the mask?
-Yeah.

02:21.880 --> 02:25.270
Stay with me. Hey,
can you get the brace, Oz?

02:25.360 --> 02:26.554
Here we go.
-Stay with me.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.119
All right.
-Get in there.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.472
One, two, three.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.354
What was that?

02:35.440 --> 02:37.510
Whoa, whoa. Hey, officer!

02:37.600 --> 02:39.830
Fell out of his pocket.
-It fell.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.874
Toby!

02:55.480 --> 02:57.232
He's gone.
-What, you connected?

02:57.320 --> 02:59.390
Yeah.
-You heard it? Are you okay?

03:01.120 --> 03:02.394
Just wait.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.955
Dispatch, this is 960.
Victim is VSA, vital signs absent.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.355
You look beat.
-Yeah, it's been a crazy night.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.830
How about some coffee?
-Sure.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.913
So, what's going on in there?

04:01.720 --> 04:04.757
Have you ever known anyone that's
crossed over and come back?

04:04.840 --> 04:07.479
You mean after flat-lining?
-Yeah.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.915
Is there anything to that
whole white Iight thing?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.673
There are some documented cases,
but the truth is

04:12.760 --> 04:15.035
when your body shuts down,
you lose control over your eyes,

04:15.120 --> 04:18.714
and your pupils dilate,
and that's what explains the bright light.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.270
Yeah, I saw that.
-You saw what exactly?

04:22.360 --> 04:28.435
Well, we had a DOA tonight and I saw his...
His pupils were widening.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.317
You are exhausted.
-Yes.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.834
Guess the date's definitely off tonight.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.036
Sorry about the whole double shift.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.918
How about tomorrow night?
Dinner, movie?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.639
It's Tuesday.
-Pilates.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.395
Hey. Multi-car pileup on the Gardiner.
They need all available units.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.471
I'll be right there.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.553
Friday night?

04:49.480 --> 04:50.708
All right. All right.
-Okay.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.835
Friday.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.559
Thanks for the coffee.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.071
Oh, man, I can't work
another double for a while.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.390
I'm a zombie right now.
I mean, literally a zombie.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.675
I could eat brains and it
wouldn't be so bad to me.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.479
Brains sounds delicious right now.
And you're not Iistening.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.596
No, Oz, I saw inside death tonight.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.079
Toby, we've had people
die on us before, man.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.390
Don't worry about it.
-It was different, man. I saw the moment.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.119
I saw that actual
moment when he gave up.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.872
Gave up what?
-Life.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.871
Crossed the threshold
to wherever we go.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.474
Man, don't talk about where we go now, man.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.358
My aunt Nurkan, she had a walking pneumonia.

05:23.440 --> 05:26.079
She swore she saw Muhammad
and they had tea in Mecca.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.151
And there was a camel
in a maitre d's uniform.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.952
Gonna kill her.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.710
Where are we going?

05:43.760 --> 05:48.151
Toby, your mother loves you very much,
but we can't bring her back.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.719
Hey, Toby, man, where'd you go?

05:53.800 --> 05:55.631
It's nothing. I'm just beat.

06:10.800 --> 06:15.476
Detective Marks is expecting me. Usually
I get to walk right in here, Becker.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.796
Yeah, I kind of put some
yellow tape on that. Thanks.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.598
Oh, thank you.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.830
Why does Detective Marks just
Iet you walk right in here?

06:22.920 --> 06:24.717
'Cause she likes the
information I give her.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.473
So you got some information
on the Rosedale homicide?

06:28.200 --> 06:29.519
That's what she's
working on right now.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.511
As if you had a clue.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.433
No, it's something else.
-Something else?

06:34.520 --> 06:37.432
Great. I would love
to hear about it.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.758
Come on right in.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.599
Why do you care about Ron Wallace?
- Well, I think he was after someone.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.398
Why do you think that?
-He had a gun.

06:45.480 --> 06:48.756
He said, "Gonna kill you," before he died.
-He said that to you?

06:48.840 --> 06:51.149
Not to me, no,
but he said it. Yeah.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.673
You think Detective Marks would
be interested in this information?

06:55.760 --> 06:57.079
Yeah, I thought she might.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.515
She can't be sleeping
with this guy.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.718
Toby, I see you around here more
than I see half my detectives.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.917
So what is it?
-What? What is what?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.514
What is it with you and Marks?
-Well, I just...

07:09.600 --> 07:12.273
I wanted to talk to her about
what we're talking about.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.237
Hey, there.
-What's going on?

07:16.120 --> 07:17.599
Toby here just dropped by.

07:17.680 --> 07:20.672
He's got some information
for you on Ron Wallace.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.992
Who?

07:23.080 --> 07:26.231
Yeah, you know, maybe I
should come back another time?

07:26.320 --> 07:27.958
What the hell is going on?

07:28.040 --> 07:29.359
Looks to me like this
was an accident, Marks.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.429
Why are you wasting
your time on it?

07:30.520 --> 07:32.829
Toby, make an excuse and get out of here.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.349
You know, I got to get back to work...
-Hold on a second.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.000
Since when does a paramedic do your legwork

07:38.080 --> 07:40.913
on a case you're not even on?
-Well...

07:41.000 --> 07:42.877
All right. I'll tell him.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.233
You probably guessed it.
You wanna know the truth?

07:46.320 --> 07:47.719
Yes.
-All right.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.028
We're dating.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.474
Oh, my God. Son of a bitch.

07:54.720 --> 07:58.759
I'm sorry. Clearly not
very professional.

08:00.760 --> 08:04.036
I guess I'll see you later tonight.
I've got work I got to finish up.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.155
Should I wait up or...

08:05.240 --> 08:07.879
Don't make anything more out of this
than getting your ass out of here.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.916
Okay, well, I got it, then.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.470
I'll Ieave you two lovebirds alone.
-All right.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.676
Marks, I want an update on the Rosedale case

08:17.760 --> 08:20.354
on my desk this afternoon.
-For sure.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.919
Him and Charlie?

08:25.520 --> 08:28.671
What the hell was that?
-I don't know. He just cornered me.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.593
That's all I had.
-Who's Ron Wallace?

08:32.880 --> 08:35.996
He's a guy who died the other night.
I think he's a hitman.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.837
Toby, you're driving me nuts.
-Was a hitman.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.357
I found this picture on him.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.432
The only thing on his mind was,
"Gonna kill you. Gonna kill you."

08:46.520 --> 08:48.556
Surveillance photo
and he had a gun.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.154
You think he was hired to kill her?
-Don't know.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.959
A lot of ex-cons carry guns, Toby.
They feel safer that way.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.237
He was an ex-con?
-Yeah, 15 years for embezzlement.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.788
That's big. Is that his file?
-Yeah. Excuse me, please.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.950
Take a look?
-Yeah, go ahead.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.276
Okay, thanks.
-Good.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.392
He wouldn't say where the money was.
So he never made parole.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.232
Four million from a
financial institute.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.788
Squeaky clean since he
got out 11 months ago.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.552
Except for the gun.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.598
It's a little late to get
him on that now, isn't it?

09:21.680 --> 09:24.638
So, you done here? I've got a report
due on a homicide I got to get to.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.756
Yeah, should I wait up for you?
Are you gonna be late?

09:26.840 --> 09:30.435
You really want me to hurt you,
don't you? Get out of here.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.757
Snowmobiling. Like that's a sport.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.831
Don't even get me started
on cross-country skiing.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.708
Combines all the fun of walking with the
thrill of being physically handicapped.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.438
Are you listening to me?
-I'm sure it's a threat.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.114
What?
-What I told you, "I'm gonna kill you."

09:47.920 --> 09:50.070
I think there's a woman out
there who's in trouble.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.593
When did you tune me out?

09:52.840 --> 09:56.913
Moguls? Baran?
-Baran. My cousin, Baran.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.195
I was telling you that he's
kind of an idiot, you know?

09:59.280 --> 10:02.477
So he was snowmobiling.
He wipes out on this 300-foot glacier.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.959
They pronounce him
dead at the scene.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.429
Then, 10 minutes later on
the way to the hospital,

10:06.520 --> 10:08.988
he snaps awake and starts singing
the Turkish national anthem.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.513
Why?
-I don't know. He likes the national anthem.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.033
It's a catchy song.
That's not the point.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.396
But he told my uncle Apo
that while he was out,

10:15.480 --> 10:17.675
he could see that
everything was white.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.196
He was in snow, right? Snow. White.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.716
Yeah, but he told my uncle Apo that
while he was in this whiteness,

10:24.800 --> 10:26.472
he had this complete
feeling of peace.

10:26.560 --> 10:31.190
Well, this guy didn't have a feeling of
peace. He had a gun and he had this photo.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.475
I think he wanted
to kill this girl.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.630
Yeah, but he's dead now, right?
-What if she's a marked woman?

10:35.720 --> 10:37.278
What if there's someone
else out there after her?

10:38.480 --> 10:40.914
So, what, we're gonna track this
girl down and warn her ahead of time?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.433
Is that what you're thinking?
-Yeah, it is.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.273
You know, it's a big city, Toby.
I don't know how we're gonna do it.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.351
Well, I say we look at the picture,

10:47.440 --> 10:50.716
we find the building she's standing
in front of and we start from there.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.872
We're not gonna find this building.
Oh, I know this building.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.552
Hey, you don't know this building?
-No.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.279
You see, this is why I do the
driving and you do the daydreaming.

10:58.360 --> 10:59.793
See, this is why we're friends.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.512
Hey, hand it over.
-No, you're driving.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.636
I got two hands. Come on.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.440
There you go. Right there.
-Where?

11:12.520 --> 11:14.476
Right here?
-Yeah.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.551
Yeah, you're good. Look at that.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.391
She come out yet?
-Yeah, she came out earlier,

11:27.480 --> 11:31.871
but I like standing out here
in the cold. What'd you get?

11:31.960 --> 11:33.712
Remote control helicopter.
-Another one?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.916
Yeah. They fly away, you know?
-Yeah.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.393
There she is.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.998
Hey. Excuse me, miss. How are you?

11:46.360 --> 11:47.395
I'm not trying to hit on you.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.552
That's good 'cause you
have mustard on your nose.

11:51.320 --> 11:54.790
Look, hey... Did I get it?
-What do you want?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.791
You don't know who I am. I get that.
-No, I don't.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.757
But do you know who this guy is?

12:00.600 --> 12:03.319
Are you a cop?
-No, I'm not. Do you know him?

12:03.400 --> 12:06.995
Yes. Yes, he's my father.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.840
ID'ing your father. That's tough.

12:15.920 --> 12:20.311
So were you and your father close?
-No. No. When he went away,

12:20.400 --> 12:23.392
my mother didn't want me to
have anything to do with him.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.835
Then she remarried.
-You ever see him again?

12:25.920 --> 12:28.912
I wrote to him when I was 19.
He didn't want me to visit.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.151
Didn't want me to be sad.
- How'd that sit with you?

12:32.240 --> 12:33.593
You know what? I was relieved.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.910
From then on I just told
everyone my father was dead.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.194
It's funny 'cause
then just a week ago

12:41.280 --> 12:43.430
he called and left a message
saying he wanted to see me

12:43.520 --> 12:46.478
and it was urgent.
-Did he say what it was about?

12:47.480 --> 12:50.677
No. Why? Did he say
something before he died?

12:50.760 --> 12:52.591
He was definitely trying
to communicate, yeah.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.194
Is this about the money?
Because I don't know anything about it.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.589
I never said anything about money.
-What money are we talking about?

12:57.680 --> 13:01.434
The four million that he stole. People
have been trying to find it for years.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.352
Yeah, that's him.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.391
Thank you for bringing me.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.959
So what do you do?

13:36.240 --> 13:38.674
I am an illustrator
for graphic novels.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.398
Wow, that's cool.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.356
It's what I always
wanted to do, so...

13:43.440 --> 13:46.989
Here you go. Some water, some salt.
It's the best thing for you when you faint.

13:47.080 --> 13:51.232
Thank you. I'll just take the water.
-Okay. I'll help myself.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.477
I'm sorry. I don't know
what happened to me.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.516
Well, you lost your father.
It's understandable.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.115
No, I Iost my father when I was 15.
When he went to jail.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.830
Must've been dealing with
some serious business.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.832
My mom divorced him when
the jail door slammed.

14:07.920 --> 14:12.118
Birthdays, Christmases, graduation.
He was never there.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.829
So, yeah, I would say that I'm
working through some issues.

14:15.920 --> 14:19.037
You told me your father tried to call you.

14:19.120 --> 14:25.275
He was calling me constantly last week.
I finally agreed to meet with him.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.950
It was supposed to be last night.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.031
Did he say what he wanted?

14:32.800 --> 14:35.519
Lindsay, your dad had a
gun on him when he died.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.673
What? He had a gun on him
when he was coming to see me?

14:39.760 --> 14:41.113
Can you think of any reason why...

14:41.200 --> 14:43.475
Any reason why my father
would want to kill me?

14:43.560 --> 14:47.109
Look, we're not saying that.
-Yeah, good, because it's ridiculous.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.633
I mean, he was a thief,
not a murderer.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.755
Well, maybe someone...

14:49.840 --> 14:50.829
Easy, Toby, she's fragile.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.992
You're saying someone did what?

14:54.080 --> 14:56.310
Maybe there's someone still out
there who wants to kill you.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.712
Someone still out there
who wants me dead?

15:01.080 --> 15:02.832
She's gonna faint again.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.876
Let me get you some more water.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.919
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Lindsay, I know a detective.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.638
We can call her and we
can tell her everything.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.995
She'll probably help you out.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.390
Oz! She fainted again.
-I told you.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.237
I don't know why you
don't listen to me, Toby.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.833
You got to know these
things about women.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.558
Will you stop nagging me,
man? I wanted to tell her.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.995
Hey, you could see it in her eyes.
She was feeling light-headed.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.354
I mean, women faint
around me all the time.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.908
Could you people please focus
on my grandson's nose, already?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.230
Absolutely, Mr Portenstein.
-Completely overrated!

15:33.320 --> 15:34.548
What's that?
-Grandchildren!

15:34.640 --> 15:37.234
They're always running around,
getting into things.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.515
Be right there. Hey, how you doing?
-Good.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.511
Good. Hey, I found her.
-Who?

15:41.600 --> 15:44.478
Dead guy's daughter. Lindsay Wallace.
He was gonna go see her that night.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.471
Okay, you know why?
-No.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.152
All right, I'll talk to her.
-Really?

15:48.240 --> 15:49.992
Yeah, well, we got a
call from a witness

15:50.080 --> 15:53.390
who saw a guy being chased by a
vehicle over at Cox and Dundas.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.357
Unless that was you?
-No.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.079
Okay, well, this could
be a possible homicide.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.718
And I repeat, Toby, "Possible."

16:00.960 --> 16:04.191
That mug shot that you stole
from my desk, I want that back.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.753
Shall we?
-Yes.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.509
I told you I didn't want you
playing with my coin collection.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.434
I wasn't playing. I was looking.
-Then why is it stuck up your nose?

16:18.520 --> 16:22.149
This is seven-year-old Sullivan Van Deusan,
has a penny stuck up his...

16:22.240 --> 16:24.310
Not "a penny."

16:24.400 --> 16:28.552
A 1941 Lincoln steel US penny.

16:29.640 --> 16:33.110
Oz, foosball.
-Yeah, sure, right this way.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.670
Come on. Penny for your
thoughts, right? Okay.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.429
How was Pilates?
-It was cancelled.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.670
The instructor threw out his
back opening a bottle of wine.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.558
You should've called me.
-Friday, I'm cooking.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.393
I'll cook.
-Better idea.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.835
Was that the penny?
-I think so.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.159
Good job, buddy. Here you go.
Put that underneath your pillow.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.309
Hide it from Grandpa.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.790
So, why don't you tell me how
your boyfriend, a paramedic,

17:01.880 --> 17:05.031
finds this girl before we do?
-'Cause he Iikes to impress me.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.998
Nice. Hi, Lindsay.
I'm Detective Sergeant Becker.

17:08.079 --> 17:09.718
This is Detective Marks.
-Hello.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.756
Hello.
-Thanks for coming in today.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.391
I'll cut straight to the chase.

17:17.520 --> 17:20.034
Can you think of any reason why
anyone would want to harm you?

17:20.160 --> 17:22.355
No, I can't think of any reason.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.431
Did your father say that
someone was threatening you?

17:24.520 --> 17:27.159
He actually didn't
say much of anything.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.596
He did sound a little nervous though,
maybe even scared.

17:32.560 --> 17:36.553
Is this about the money?
-We don't know what it's about. Not yet.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.438
But we do know that a man who was
convicted of stealing four million dollars

17:39.520 --> 17:43.638
who hadn't spoken to his daughter in years,
suddenly wants to contact her.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.471
Can you tell us why?

17:46.560 --> 17:49.472
What are you saying?
-Brian, slow down.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.394
I'm just asking a simple
question, Lindsay.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.669
I don't know where the money is
if that's what you're thinking.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.469
Okay. Thank you.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.754
Okay.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.391
Are we finished here?
-Yeah, we're finished,

18:08.480 --> 18:10.710
but if anything funny happens,
you can always reach us here.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.835
I'm sorry. "Funny"?

18:11.920 --> 18:14.957
Yeah, like finding four million
dollars in your sock drawer.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.117
Thank you, detectives.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.275
At least I know
where I get it from.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.397
He made it sound like I did something,
like I had the money.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.995
It's okay. Becker suspects
everyone of something.

18:31.160 --> 18:35.119
Well, it's just getting a
little too crazy, that's all.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.953
The landlord wants my father's
stuff out by the end of the week.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.998
I have to plan his funeral.
I don't even know if he has a will.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.551
I mean, if my mother knows,
she's not gonna tell me.

18:43.640 --> 18:44.959
Lindsay, it's okay.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.349
If I can help you with anything,
you just Iet me know, all right?

18:57.840 --> 19:00.991
Thanks for doing this with me.
-Hey, not a problem.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.956
Oh, my God.

19:07.160 --> 19:09.196
This is all you had left.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.954
What is all of this?

19:18.040 --> 19:22.636
Oh, my God. This is me.
This is my life.

19:22.720 --> 19:28.352
This is everything. These are
from when I was in high school.

19:32.720 --> 19:37.077
Beyond the Night. This is the first
graphic novel I ever illustrated.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.912
That's great.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.279
I always wondered what
had become of him.

19:50.400 --> 19:54.678
Are your parents still alive?
-I never met my dad.

19:54.760 --> 20:00.392
Not even sure if he knows I exist.
My mother, I lost her when I was five.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.190
Yeah, I have memories
here and there,

20:09.280 --> 20:12.238
but, you know, it's
pretty much a closed book.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.514
And this is his trial.
These are court transcripts,

20:23.600 --> 20:27.513
newspaper clippings.
I mean, this is his appeal file.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.795
Well, they call that an innocence box.
-A what?

20:29.880 --> 20:33.270
These guys, they go to jail and they
wanna become prison library lawyers.

20:33.360 --> 20:36.033
They wanna prove that they're not guilty.
-Even if they are?

20:36.120 --> 20:38.429
I don't think they'd spend that
much time doing it if they were.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.556
Maybe this is why he wanted to meet with me.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.835
Maybe he had found proof.
-Maybe.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.752
You recognise these
names or addresses?

20:48.160 --> 20:53.234
No. No, I don't recognise any of them,
but they're from all over the country.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.713
How about "BPI"?

21:00.680 --> 21:02.238
Lindsay?
-What?

21:02.320 --> 21:04.038
Did you hear that?

21:13.440 --> 21:14.919
Toby?

21:31.240 --> 21:33.435
Did you see who did it?
-I saw a door.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.555
How about you?

21:34.640 --> 21:36.312
No, by the time I got out there,
they were gone.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.197
You have any idea what
they might have been after?

21:38.280 --> 21:40.191
There's nothing of value
in the apartment, so...

21:40.280 --> 21:42.794
So, not an extra four million
dollars just lying around?

21:42.880 --> 21:44.836
Hey, Charlie, come on.
I would've told you that.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.592
You would, but would she?

21:46.680 --> 21:47.954
We both would've.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.949
All right, I'll go over to his place.
I'll check it out.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.268
See if I come up with anything.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.396
And if anything changes for you,
you can always reach me here.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.515
Thank you.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.353
Now get out of here before
Becker gets back from lunch.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.555
Thanks, Charlie.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.153
You know, sometimes I
wish I could read minds.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.514
Really? Why?
-I don't know.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.750
I just get the feeling she thinks
I know more than what I'm saying.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.030
You're going to his funeral?
-Yeah, what's the big deal?

22:11.120 --> 22:12.758
I don't know. You don't know him.
-I know her.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.273
You don't know her.
You don't know anything about her.

22:14.360 --> 22:18.478
What's her favourite movie? Favourite food?
Pet peeves? Do you know her pet peeves?

22:18.720 --> 22:20.233
You don't know her pet peeves,
forget about it.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.629
Oz, she needs help. I can help her.
That's it. Relax.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.153
You know what,
Toby? I just figured this out.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.037
You got a hero complex.
That's what.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.554
You know why?
-No, I don't know why.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.312
Can you tell me why?
-Toby, you have a gift

22:30.400 --> 22:33.073
and you don't know what
you did to deserve it,

22:33.160 --> 22:34.309
so you help people.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.312
It's your way of paying the
world back for your gift.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.832
It's simple psychology.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.480
Then, make me a superhero.
I'II make you my sidekick.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.199
No, I don't like that.
I keep working on it.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.598
Ma, this is my friend, Toby Logan.

23:02.680 --> 23:05.274
Hey.
-Oh, the paramedic who found Ron.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.352
Yeah, that's right.
-Thank you for doing your best.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.350
I appreciate you coming, Mom.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.431
Days I dreamed of his funeral.

23:18.040 --> 23:21.715
Come on, Lindsay. Let's not pretend
we were the perfect family.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.595
I do have some good memories.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.240
We went to his place.
-Really?

23:32.120 --> 23:36.671
There was a box. It was full of
clippings and photos. I just...

23:38.040 --> 23:39.996
What if he was innocent, Mom?

23:41.160 --> 23:42.957
You're going through the
same thing I went through.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.268
Which is?

23:44.360 --> 23:47.477
Coming to terms with who
your father really was.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.838
Well, maybe he wasn't such a monster, Mom.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.510
Nor was he a saint.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.790
My condolences. Your father was a good man.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.598
Thank you.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.670
You don't recognise me, do you?

24:24.760 --> 24:26.079
Syd Pickersgill.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.833
Yes, yes, I... Yes,
of course, I remember you.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.359
Yes.
-Lovely to see you.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.517
Hi, Toby.
-Nice to meet you.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.830
Well, you and my
father go way back.

24:40.040 --> 24:43.316
High school. Oh, life is weird.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.072
Your dad, no matter what,
nothing ever worked out for him.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.628
He did nothing and they
nailed him for that theft.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.792
What? Nothing?
-You know the story?

24:52.880 --> 24:55.314
No, my mother refused
to talk about it.

24:55.400 --> 24:59.154
She asked me to get him a job at work.
Metro York Financial.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.550
After eight months, they caught
him on a security camera.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.437
He was a programmer,
he was working late,

25:04.520 --> 25:09.275
and at exactly the same time,
four million disappeared electronically.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.794
The way I see it,
someone set him up.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.950
Did you know he was working
on his own innocence?

25:17.040 --> 25:19.838
He dug a few things up.
I don't know what, but he was close.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.399
He had a gun on him when he died.

25:21.480 --> 25:22.629
Courtesy of me.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.948
Makes sense.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.076
He was nervous that the people
who actually stole the money

25:26.160 --> 25:29.436
knew he was on their trail.
-People Iike Arthur Smith and Barry Cooper?

25:29.520 --> 25:32.512
Never heard of them. What's that?

25:32.600 --> 25:35.672
Well, it's a book we found
with this list of names.

25:35.760 --> 25:39.309
Hey, Syd, do you know what BPI means?
-Bank of the Polynesian Islands.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.231
Maybe that's where the money is.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.073
Hey.
-Okay, first of all, you and I are not a couple.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.718
I know that. Relax.
-Okay. Well, then good.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.915
Where am I going?
-Out of here.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.911
Becker's been all over
me because of you.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.433
Listen, I was just coming
here to Iet you know

25:53.520 --> 25:55.715
that the money may have gone to the
Bank of the Polynesian Islands.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.711
Okay, fine. We find the money,
we'll know who put it in there,

25:57.800 --> 25:59.472
but we're still 15 years too late.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.710
And I found a list of
names in his apartment.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.473
When did you find these?
-Before I got knocked out.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.592
Hey.
-Hello again.

26:09.680 --> 26:13.116
So, is this work or pleasure?
-Just work.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.590
Just giving Detective Marks here new
information on the Ron Wallace case.

26:16.680 --> 26:18.432
You really think you're impressing her?

26:18.520 --> 26:22.149
Why don't you just let her do her job?
-Brian, he's just trying to help me.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.275
He's trying to play cop.

26:23.360 --> 26:27.239
Not trying to do your job here, Brian.
Just helping out Miss Marks, here.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.548
Toby, I appreciate it.

26:28.640 --> 26:32.030
What do these guys do on a date?
Read old crime reports?

26:33.480 --> 26:35.311
He likes to impress me.
-Oh, I bet.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.709
Listen, I got to get going.
I got to freshen up for tonight.

26:37.800 --> 26:38.994
Will see you. All right?

26:39.080 --> 26:40.308
See you later.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.470
See you, Becker.
-Bye.

26:57.240 --> 27:00.596
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I was wondering...

27:00.680 --> 27:02.591
I'm sorry, if you
want a full detail,

27:02.680 --> 27:04.432
I'm not making any more appointments today,

27:04.520 --> 27:05.919
but I could set you
up for tomorrow.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.116
No, no, my name is Lindsay Wallace.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.078
My father was Ron Wallace.
-Lindsay? Lindsay?

27:11.160 --> 27:14.835
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

27:14.920 --> 27:16.273
Lindsay.

27:16.360 --> 27:17.998
I should've recognised you from your photos.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.798
I've heard so much about you.

27:19.880 --> 27:23.839
Oh, Lindsay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't at the funeral.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.638
I couldn't get anybody
to swap shifts with me.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.553
It's okay.
-Your dad was such a great guy.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.791
He was so sweet. I'm really sorry.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.033
Thanks.
-Yeah.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.588
I've got some of his
stuff over here.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.797
He was so proud of you.

27:39.880 --> 27:44.635
He was always talking about the
beautiful illustrations that you did.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.073
Really?

27:46.160 --> 27:48.276
He knew everything about you.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.871
Well, thank you.
-You're welcome.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.156
Take care.
-Bye now.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.276
This is good. So tonight.
-Tonight.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.510
Tonight, I'm gonna cook.
-I'm buying the fish.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.511
All right, that's good. Tonight.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.830
Hold on one sec, just a sec.
Hey, it's Toby.

28:02.920 --> 28:07.038
Toby. BPI, Bender
Private Investigations.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.269
How'd you figure that out?

28:08.360 --> 28:10.828
I found it on a card in
my dad's work clothes.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.673
Look, meet me at
601 Queensway East.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.672
Listen, I'm getting off work now.
I'll meet you right there.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.955
I'll explain Iater. It's good.
-If I see you tonight.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.758
You will. It's on.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.150
Yeah, sure. I knew Ron.
I did a little work for him.

28:27.240 --> 28:30.755
Of course, I'm not at liberty to
discuss items of a confidential nature.

28:30.840 --> 28:34.150
Right, well,
Lindsay was Ron's daughter.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.796
Easier to look at than the old man.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.999
Well, what can I do for you, honey?

28:40.080 --> 28:43.356
Well, I was just curious as to the
nature of the work that he hired you for.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.829
Well, you know,
he gave me a list of names.

28:45.920 --> 28:49.276
Wanted me to find out who they were.
-These the names?

28:51.800 --> 28:53.756
Yeah, sure.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.631
Said they had something to
do with him being innocent

28:57.720 --> 29:00.792
of the embezzlement charge.
-Do you know who they are?

29:00.880 --> 29:05.556
Bunch of common names really.
Arthur Smith, Barry Cooper, Sandra Miller.

29:05.640 --> 29:08.552
When they're common like that,
is it harder to track down?

29:08.640 --> 29:11.791
That's right. And they're
15 years out of date.

29:11.880 --> 29:12.869
Here.

29:13.480 --> 29:17.996
I can get you the
list that I found.

29:19.760 --> 29:23.355
None of them knew anything about
Ron or Metro York Financial.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.112
Could find. Couldn't find.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.237
I'm sorry to hear about your dad.
He was a good man.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.359
Thank you.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.590
Did Ron ever mention what these names meant?

29:34.680 --> 29:37.274
What's this guy sniffing around for?

29:40.080 --> 29:44.437
Said it would vindicate him.
Said the less I knew, the safer I'd be.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.751
Safe from what?

29:46.840 --> 29:49.354
Well, the only man that
can answer that question

29:49.440 --> 29:51.351
isn't with us any more.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.000
Oz, watch the road. Come on.
-I got it. Take a look at that.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.439
See that? It's by Hieronymus Bosch.

30:06.520 --> 30:09.114
Dutch painter. It's called
the Ascent of the Blessed.

30:09.200 --> 30:13.398
Painted in 1490, two years before
Columbus came to the new country.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.278
You know he was Turkish, by the way.
-Who? Columbus?

30:16.360 --> 30:20.239
Oh, yeah. Yeah. He named
the turkey after Turkey.

30:21.360 --> 30:24.909
Look, see the bright light there,
near death experiences and all that?

30:25.440 --> 30:27.874
Five hundred years old, my friend.

30:27.960 --> 30:31.316
You know, you got a point there.
-See, starting to see the lights.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.756
Yeah, but not the same light.
-What are you talking about?

30:38.400 --> 30:39.833
Toby?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.592
Gonna kill her.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.838
Hey, Oz, watch out!

30:48.760 --> 30:51.672
No problem. What the hell
are you talking about?

30:53.640 --> 30:55.551
Maybe it wasn't a white light.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.996
What?
-What if it was headlights from a car?

30:59.080 --> 31:00.354
Really?

31:01.840 --> 31:04.673
There were just headlights now.
-It's Lindsay.

31:04.760 --> 31:08.878
Hey, Lindsay. Hey, Lindsay,
calm down. Calm down.

31:08.960 --> 31:12.157
Are you all right? What hospital?
-What?

31:13.240 --> 31:15.151
All right, I'm on my way.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.158
Hospital?
-Yeah, Lindsay's in the hospital.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.753
Go to St Luke's.

31:23.640 --> 31:24.675
Hey, Charlie.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.637
Somebody tried to break into
Lindsay Wallace's apartment.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.154
What?
-She's a little shaken up, but she's fine.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.549
I'm on my way to St Luke's.
-All right, I'll meet you there.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.755
Another thing. You were right.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.070
Someone tried to run over
Ron Wallace with a car.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.118
It's not a car. It's a pickup truck or an SUV.
-Wait. How do you know that?

31:38.200 --> 31:40.839
Because Forensics found tyre marks
in the grass near where he died.

31:40.920 --> 31:41.955
Was this a homicide?

31:42.040 --> 31:43.314
That's what I'm gonna find out.

31:43.400 --> 31:44.958
We'll see you there.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.557
Hey, Lindsay, what happened?

31:54.400 --> 31:56.630
It was pretty scary actually.

31:57.960 --> 32:01.953
I was out with friends and I got home.
I barely opened the door,

32:02.040 --> 32:06.238
this guy runs past me, knocks me
over like he's a football player.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.515
I hit the ground. He took off.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.197
You see this guy?
-No, it was too dark.

32:11.280 --> 32:15.159
He take anything from you?
-Not that I can tell. But...

32:16.720 --> 32:17.994
You're fine.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.831
Yeah, yeah.
-Lindsay...

32:20.920 --> 32:24.435
Pretty banged up, but...
-Lindsay, I don't want to scare you.

32:25.400 --> 32:28.312
I think what happened to
your father was intentional.

32:28.400 --> 32:32.439
I think the photo he received was a
threat to him to stop digging around.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.593
What? Why wouldn't he just
go to the police then?

32:36.680 --> 32:39.035
Would you go to the police
after what happened to him?

32:39.120 --> 32:42.271
Oh, my God.
-Hey, sorry to interrupt.

32:43.400 --> 32:44.833
So, I just got a call from Fraud.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.797
I had asked them to look
into those names for me,

32:46.880 --> 32:50.190
and it turns out that all those people
were victims in the '90s of identity theft.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.635
I don't understand what this
has to do with my father.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.870
He used to open up bank accounts
in these peoples' names.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.872
You transfer $8,000 or
$9,000 into the account.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.757
Later you go pick up the cash.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.798
Wait, so... So,
if my father stole the money,

33:02.880 --> 33:06.190
then what was he doing looking into
identity theft victims from way back when?

33:06.280 --> 33:08.840
Exactly. That's the
question I've been asking.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.558
And really the only answer
I can come up with is...

33:10.640 --> 33:13.916
He didn't take the money.
-He was just a pawn in someone's game.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.672
He was trying to
prove his innocence.

33:15.760 --> 33:19.435
What I don't understand is you
figured this out pretty quickly.

33:19.520 --> 33:22.956
The private investigator working
on this for months couldn't.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.676
Toby, be careful in there,
all right?

33:40.480 --> 33:42.948
Did Ron ever mention that
someone was threatening him?

33:43.040 --> 33:48.512
No. Like I said, made it sound
like he was swimming with sharks.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.319
He never mentioned a photo
that he had received?

33:51.400 --> 33:54.358
No.
-See, this is where it gets weird for me.

33:54.440 --> 33:58.513
You're a private investigator.
Why was he trying to protect you?

33:58.600 --> 34:01.592
That's Ron.
-You're a pretty good PI, huh?

34:02.120 --> 34:05.271
That's funny how you couldn't figure
out that the names Ron gave you

34:05.360 --> 34:09.433
were all victims of identity theft.
-Identity theft? Really?

34:10.800 --> 34:13.074
Yeah, a cop friend of mine,
she figured it out pretty quickly.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.797
Cop?

34:14.880 --> 34:18.077
Well, they have the resources.
-See, this is what I have so far.

34:18.159 --> 34:20.435
Ron was halfway there,
so he hired you.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.636
You figured out all the rest.
You found the money.

34:22.719 --> 34:24.472
You found the accounts where
the money was transferred.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.755
And, poor Ron, he's working at a car wash,
he can barely pay you.

34:26.840 --> 34:29.911
And some guy out there,
he got away with millions.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.433
And you found him, didn't you?

34:31.520 --> 34:33.078
Like you said, I'm good.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.071
No.
-What I can't figure out is

34:35.159 --> 34:36.831
where the money was transferred to.

34:36.920 --> 34:37.955
Prague.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.474
Couldn't tell you.
-Is that when you switched sides?

34:40.560 --> 34:43.027
You took a picture of Lindsay.
You sent it to Ron, trying to scare him.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.634
But he didn't scare
too easily, did he?

34:45.719 --> 34:48.438
So you decided you were gonna run him down.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.833
Just to scare him,
but he fell and he hit his head.

34:51.920 --> 34:56.038
Nice story. Except none of it happened.
-Is that your SUV out there?

34:56.120 --> 34:57.997
It's pretty nice. You see,
that's my cop friend out there.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.354
She's taking prints of your tyres

34:59.440 --> 35:01.317
to match the tracks they
found where Ron died.

35:05.560 --> 35:08.916
So, what'd they give you to shut up?
Half a million?

35:09.760 --> 35:11.113
A measly hundred grand.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.509
I hope they gave you more
than a measly hundred grand.

35:14.600 --> 35:18.070
See, now would be a good time
to cooperate with the detective

35:18.160 --> 35:19.832
and tell her who took the money.

35:22.760 --> 35:27.197
Because whatever happened to Ron,
homicide or manslaughter,

35:27.280 --> 35:29.316
it all depends on how
she tells the judge.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.192
You got him?

35:36.640 --> 35:38.790
Something you wanna say to me?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.911
We need to make a deal.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.432
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.591
Thanks.
-Hey, Lindsay.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.988
Norine, Detective Charlie Marks.

36:04.080 --> 36:06.833
This is Lindsay's mother.
-Detective.

36:06.920 --> 36:09.912
I'm gonna need for you to come
down to the station with me.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.231
I beg your pardon?
-I have a few questions for you.

36:14.400 --> 36:18.075
What's this all about?
-A missing four million dollars.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.993
We've spoken to Morris Bender.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.832
Morris Bender's an imbecile.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.194
Mother, I don't...

36:28.240 --> 36:33.189
I don't understand.
I mean, how could you do...

36:33.760 --> 36:38.436
We had no money.
And you had no opportunities.

36:39.800 --> 36:40.949
No.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.393
No, you're not allowed
to put this on me.

36:45.480 --> 36:49.393
Okay, I did it for me, too.
Does that make you feel better?

36:50.080 --> 36:54.039
No, no, it doesn't make me feel better.
You put my father in jail.

36:54.120 --> 36:57.157
And freed us to have a decent life.

36:57.240 --> 36:59.993
Well, it doesn't feel
that decent right now.

37:02.680 --> 37:06.514
You threatened my life.
-It was Morris Bender's idea.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.956
Oh, great. Great.
That makes me feel so much better.

37:10.040 --> 37:11.678
To throw Ron off course.

37:11.760 --> 37:17.039
Honey, I would never harm you, honey. Never.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.839
No. No, you would never harm me.

37:20.320 --> 37:23.153
What have you been doing all of these years?

37:23.240 --> 37:25.879
Protecting you. Giving you a life.

37:26.920 --> 37:29.753
By taking my father away from me?

37:29.840 --> 37:31.910
I think we've heard enough.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.598
Come on. Let's go.

37:37.800 --> 37:41.679
Lindsay, I'm sorry.

37:42.680 --> 37:43.954
Let's go.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.873
My whole life I thought
my father was a crook.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.190
Turns out it's my mother.

38:01.280 --> 38:04.397
God, I'm such a loser.
-No, you're not.

38:05.160 --> 38:08.232
What did I win out of all this?
-The truth.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.598
Sometimes it's hard to find.
-Is it?

38:13.720 --> 38:15.119
I think so.

38:19.360 --> 38:20.793
Thanks.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.474
You gonna book her?

38:28.560 --> 38:31.233
You're not really dating
that paramedic, are you?

38:31.320 --> 38:33.788
Nope.
-I didn't think so.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.598
You know what I'm thinking?

38:36.000 --> 38:38.434
I'll grab my coat.
-I'll meet you downstairs.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.353
Who needs a telepath?

38:43.440 --> 38:46.910
Coming. Who is it?

38:49.400 --> 38:52.358
It's you. Flowers, that's nice.

38:52.440 --> 38:53.953
Is that what I'm supposed
to bring on a date?

38:54.040 --> 38:56.429
Or chocolates.
-So?

38:56.520 --> 38:58.988
I just felt silly.
-You don't look silly.

38:59.080 --> 39:03.119
You don't look so bad yourself.
-Thank you. Thank you.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.395
Dinner is ready in half an hour.
-Great.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.233
Nope, nope, nope.
Do you have your cell phone?

39:08.320 --> 39:09.799
Really?

39:12.160 --> 39:13.513
Off.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.433
I am impressed.
You're taking no chances.
