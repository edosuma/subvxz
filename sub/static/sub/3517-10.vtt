00:32.475 --> 00:36.353
Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.

00:36.354 --> 00:39.689
"Do not grieve
the Holy Spirit of God,

00:39.690 --> 00:42.902
by whom you were sealed
for the day of redemption.

00:42.903 --> 00:48.865
Let all bitterness and wrath
and anger and clamour,

00:48.866 --> 00:53.577
and evil speaking be put away
from you with all malice.

00:53.578 --> 00:56.873
And be kind to one another,

00:56.874 --> 01:00.711
tenderhearted,
forgiving one another."

01:04.798 --> 01:08.177
Do you want me to keep going
with this, or something else?

01:15.017 --> 01:19.188
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.902
Doug, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

01:42.127 --> 01:44.378
You said that she was
just staying for a few nights.

01:44.379 --> 01:47.172
Her roommate kicked her out. She
doesn't have anywhere else to go.

01:47.173 --> 01:51.220
- It's not our problem.
- I can't put her out on the street.

01:51.221 --> 01:52.720
What's her name?

01:52.721 --> 01:54.472
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?

01:54.473 --> 01:56.392
You don't have anything
to worry about.

01:56.393 --> 01:59.185
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.

01:59.186 --> 02:01.646
There's a sleepover with some
of the kids from the day care.

02:03.941 --> 02:05.275
Does she know about me?

02:05.276 --> 02:07.025
No, I haven't told her anything.

02:07.026 --> 02:10.112
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel,

02:10.113 --> 02:11.698
- and you've taken advantage--
- I'm not kicking her out.

02:15.953 --> 02:20.249
- I could have said nothing, but I told you.
- I have to go.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.795
She better be gone
by the next time we talk.

02:49.111 --> 02:51.571
- Sir.
- What took you so long?

02:51.572 --> 02:53.155
I can have a briefing ready
in five minutes.

02:53.156 --> 02:54.655
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.

02:54.656 --> 02:56.158
He doesn't have
security clearance.

02:56.159 --> 02:58.996
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.

02:58.997 --> 03:01.039
I'll see you in my office.

03:04.293 --> 03:07.545
<i>Japanese sovereignty</i>
<i>is a matter of precedent.</i>

03:07.546 --> 03:09.838
Mr. Prime Minister,
my concern is escalation.

03:09.839 --> 03:12.757
<i>Well, I'm asking for a small</i>
<i>portion of the 7th Fleet.</i>

03:12.758 --> 03:14.593
<i>We must bring China into line.</i>

03:14.594 --> 03:17.720
<i>Show them that the US and Japan</i>
<i>maintain a strong alliance.</i>

03:17.721 --> 03:19.973
Have you reached out
directly to Beijing?

03:19.974 --> 03:23.227
<i>No recognition that</i>
<i>the island belongs to Japan.</i>

03:23.228 --> 03:25.437
Well, I'd like to speak to my
team and formulate a plan.

03:25.438 --> 03:28.064
<i>- Thank you, Mr. President.</i>
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

03:28.065 --> 03:29.860
Admiral,
for those catching up...

03:31.111 --> 03:34.197
Two Chinese destroyers
entered waters

03:34.198 --> 03:37.659
within three miles
of Yonaguni Island here,

03:37.660 --> 03:42.287
approximately six hours ago. See
how close the island is to Taiwan.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.581
This is different than the
standoff over the Senkaku Islands.

03:44.582 --> 03:46.333
It could have to do
with shipping routes.

03:46.334 --> 03:48.502
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kids,

03:48.503 --> 03:51.046
so they're picking
on the little one.

03:51.047 --> 03:52.633
- Do you see that?
- What?

03:52.634 --> 03:54.800
In the alley, camera two.

03:54.801 --> 03:59.096
All posts, white male,
hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.

03:59.097 --> 04:01.350
Southeast side of Fair St.

04:30.546 --> 04:33.213
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag

04:33.214 --> 04:35.301
and place your hands
on your head.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.136
Stay right where you are.

04:43.267 --> 04:47.937
Mrs. Underwood? Will you
come downstairs, please?

04:47.938 --> 04:51.732
- Where's Francis?
- He got delayed at the White House,

04:51.733 --> 04:53.400
there was an emergency meeting.

04:53.401 --> 04:56.154
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.

06:21.945 --> 06:25.852

06:34.503 --> 06:36.628
The 7th Fleet is near Guam?

06:36.629 --> 06:39.964
Ninety miles north. We could have ships
to Yonaguni in less than a week.

06:39.965 --> 06:43.594
But even sending them in that direction will
be picked up by the Chinese satellites.

06:43.595 --> 06:46.095
Well, we have to stand with our
allies, that can't be in question.

06:46.096 --> 06:48.724
What if we don't send ships,
just make a strong statement

06:48.725 --> 06:51.267
condemning their excursion
into Japan's territorial waters.

06:51.268 --> 06:54.354
We still have to offer the Chinese an
incentive to call back their destroyers.

06:54.355 --> 06:57.733
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like
to have contingency plans in place.

06:57.734 --> 07:01.277
- Already drafting them, sir.
- Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.

07:01.278 --> 07:05.156
See if there's a concrete ask, if they don't
have one, let's create a list of options.

07:05.157 --> 07:09.496
- Right away, sir.
- How about coordination with the Japanese navy?

07:09.497 --> 07:12.498
Go. Don't engage
with our navy yet.

07:12.499 --> 07:16.837
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister
Oshiro and express our intentions.

07:20.758 --> 07:25.636
Former marine. He showed up at the outer
perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag.

07:25.637 --> 07:27.596
- And strapped to his body.
- Jesus.

07:27.597 --> 07:29.848
We apprehended him,
the press isn't aware.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.141
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible

07:32.142 --> 07:34.519
for sending the package
of white powder to the capitol.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.399
So this time he really wanted
to take me out for real.

07:37.400 --> 07:42.986
Not exactly. His wife got an abortion
last week without telling him.

07:42.987 --> 07:47.074
- Oh, my God. It was me.
- Yes, you were the target.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.200
We'd like to keep you down
here with us, Mrs. Underwood,

07:49.201 --> 07:52.454
- until we confirm he was acting alone.
- I'll stay.

07:52.455 --> 07:54.205
No, you have to get back
to the White House.

07:54.206 --> 07:56.919
- I can work from here.
- Francis, I'm fine. Honestly.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.169
I'm just gonna be in here.

07:59.170 --> 08:03.548
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.719
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on--

08:05.720 --> 08:10.724
- No, I want it to be Meechum.
- Absolutely, sir. As long as necessary.

08:15.271 --> 08:17.230
I'll be back as soon as I can.

08:18.189 --> 08:19.608
It's OK.

08:31.369 --> 08:34.163
Don't go to California.

08:34.164 --> 08:37.918
Mm...
Be nice to be reelected.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.879
You're gonna win.

08:41.880 --> 08:45.717
Not if I don't give
the voters more face time.

08:57.562 --> 08:59.272
When did you get it?

09:03.944 --> 09:07.113
- The Army?
- Yeah.

09:08.239 --> 09:10.158
It's grown since then.

09:11.869 --> 09:13.829
Tell me about it.

09:15.205 --> 09:16.748
No.

09:17.917 --> 09:19.667
Why not?

09:19.668 --> 09:21.921
I don't want to.

09:31.889 --> 09:34.098
What are you doing?

09:35.643 --> 09:38.395
Tell me about the tattoo.

09:42.148 --> 09:46.109
- That's not fair.
- So what?

09:46.110 --> 09:49.322
You think you can just get me
wet and I'll spill everything?

09:49.323 --> 09:54.036
- I don't think so...
- Mm...

09:56.287 --> 09:58.122
...I know so.

10:11.803 --> 10:13.346
Tell me.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.517
I like the pain.

10:20.353 --> 10:24.691
- Of the needle?
- Yeah.

10:25.943 --> 10:27.945
How bad did it hurt?

10:30.154 --> 10:31.823
It hurt a lot.

10:35.326 --> 10:37.369
You like when it hurts?

10:42.918 --> 10:44.335
I killed a lot of people.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.216
What?

10:52.303 --> 10:53.511
In the Army.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.225
The pain...

10:59.977 --> 11:01.645
...it helped.

11:09.527 --> 11:10.988
Finish.

11:20.122 --> 11:22.038
The most I could find
was some wrangling with the EPA

11:22.039 --> 11:25.165
when he opened his first plant,
but that was almost 40 years ago.

11:25.166 --> 11:28.878
- We need more. I want Tusk gone.
- Doyle and I will keep looking.

11:28.879 --> 11:31.255
If you haven't found anything now,
what makes you think you will?

11:31.256 --> 11:34.467
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.

11:34.468 --> 11:37.846
You think Tusk isn't planning his
next attack even as we speak?

11:37.847 --> 11:41.434
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.478
You want to shift tactics?

11:44.729 --> 11:47.941
The casino. We go public
as soon as possible.

11:47.942 --> 11:49.691
You said that was a last resort.

11:49.692 --> 11:51.569
Seth, you need to find a way
to make that happen

11:51.570 --> 11:53.320
so it doesn't link to us.

11:53.321 --> 11:56.196
If we launch that missile,
it could blow us up too.

11:56.197 --> 11:57.740
Not if we spin it right.

11:57.741 --> 11:59.450
- If we keep the focus on--
- Seth.

11:59.451 --> 12:01.327
You're here to listen,
not contribute.

12:01.328 --> 12:03.999
I wouldn't have him here if I
didn't want him to contribute.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.002
Sir... he's been sitting
with this for three hours.

12:08.003 --> 12:09.919
I've been working on it
for three months.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.171
And accomplished nothing.

12:11.172 --> 12:12.714
It's time we go on the
offensive.

12:12.715 --> 12:14.924
- What do you think?
- Ayla Sayyad.

12:14.925 --> 12:17.927
- She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?

12:17.928 --> 12:21.389
She never mentioned a casino, but
now that I know what the dots are,

12:21.390 --> 12:24.061
I can see that she's
starting to connect them.

12:25.436 --> 12:27.272
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.

12:27.273 --> 12:31.817
I imagine they're
waiting on the White House.

12:31.818 --> 12:36.031
I hear there have been regular meetings
in the Situation Room since last night.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.373
Let me call you right back.

13:09.773 --> 13:11.564
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.

13:11.565 --> 13:13.566
- I just sent you a picture.
<i>- Yeah, I got it.</i>

13:13.567 --> 13:16.319
- What does it mean?
<i>- It's strange, it doesn't make sense.</i>

13:16.320 --> 13:21.034
- Tell me.
<i>- "Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.</i>

13:21.035 --> 13:23.410
<i>Or "pursue money."</i>

13:23.411 --> 13:26.330
- Follow the money?
<i>- That could work.</i>

13:26.331 --> 13:27.999
Thanks, Lynne.

13:45.643 --> 13:48.184
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new?

13:48.185 --> 13:51.187
- These lamps as well?
- I've made a few changes.

13:51.188 --> 13:54.523
You get so used to a place,
the smallest things stand out.

13:54.524 --> 13:56.692
I apologize for not
being responsive sooner.

13:56.693 --> 13:59.030
I've been focused
on the midterms.

13:59.031 --> 14:02.323
Oh, there's no need to explain.

14:02.324 --> 14:07.163
Mrs. Underwood, you know how
much I respect your intentions,

14:07.164 --> 14:10.959
but I've thought
deeply about this and

14:10.960 --> 14:14.503
I can't cosponsor the bill
in its current form.

14:14.504 --> 14:17.005
Civilian oversight
is too extreme a step,

14:17.006 --> 14:21.385
but I'd be happy to revisit some of
the other less extreme proposals.

14:21.386 --> 14:24.264
You think we're
being extremist?

14:24.265 --> 14:27.098
I want to help with this issue,
but this bill goes through--

14:27.099 --> 14:31.270
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.524
Almost every woman in the
House supports this bill.

14:34.525 --> 14:39.569
- And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.

14:39.570 --> 14:42.364
I didn't lie. I didn't lie.

14:42.365 --> 14:46.492
I... I want to help. As long as
we rethink some of the language.

14:46.493 --> 14:49.787
Are you trying to distance yourself from
us because of the Galloway scandal?

14:49.788 --> 14:52.332
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances

14:52.333 --> 14:55.294
- of reelection if you associate with me.
- That's not it.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.673
It's because I honestly don't
believe in this approach.

14:58.674 --> 15:02.676
Do you realize
the message this sends?

15:02.677 --> 15:07.680
The only woman in congressional leadership
in both parties, and you bow out?

15:07.681 --> 15:13.395
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't
just bow out. I'll actively fight it.

15:13.396 --> 15:16.982
You never asked my position.
You assumed.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.609
I can't imagine
what that position must be.

15:19.610 --> 15:23.238
I've served in war zones,
I know firsthand how important--

15:23.239 --> 15:25.489
We're not talking
about war zones.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.493
We're talking
about sexual assault.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.664
How about a military commission
to review the internal--

15:31.665 --> 15:36.252
We don't need more studies,
we need reform.

15:36.253 --> 15:41.423
Well, let's continue this conversation
when I return from California.

15:41.424 --> 15:45.553
I'll be back the day after
tomorrow if you change your mind.

15:45.554 --> 15:50.267
I won't, but I hope
you change yours.

15:56.439 --> 15:59.649
China was insulted at the
notion that we could buy them off.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.817
Do I need
to call President Qian?

16:01.818 --> 16:04.028
I doubt he would contradict
one of his ministers.

16:04.029 --> 16:05.905
See if he's willing
to talk one-on-one.

16:05.906 --> 16:08.451
You should know, sir,
Japan is also preparing

16:08.452 --> 16:11.995
to deploy three destroyers
and a light cruiser.

16:11.996 --> 16:14.748
They're upping the ante.

16:14.749 --> 16:17.417
Have Ambassador Hines get in
touch with the prime minister,

16:17.418 --> 16:20.504
and ask if Japan will hold off
until I make contact with Beijing.

16:20.505 --> 16:22.464
Yes, sir.

16:22.465 --> 16:24.716
Have you gotten
any rest at all?

16:24.717 --> 16:28.680
- No, have you?
- No, not yet.

16:30.014 --> 16:32.724
How's Claire?

16:32.725 --> 16:36.854
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated
attempt, but they're being cautious.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.731
After the Galloway thing
and the interview,

16:40.732 --> 16:42.819
half the country thinks
she's a baby killer,

16:42.820 --> 16:44.778
or an adulterer, or both.

16:44.779 --> 16:48.072
But Claire's taking it in
stride. We're in good hands.

16:48.073 --> 16:51.617
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.

16:51.618 --> 16:54.912
One of us should, probably the one
that's calling all the shots.

16:54.913 --> 16:57.457
No, I can hold out
a little while longer.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.334
No, go to the residence,
spend some time with your wife.

16:59.335 --> 17:01.254
You'll come back feeling
like a new man.

17:01.255 --> 17:05.925
Honestly, it's less
stressful here.

17:08.051 --> 17:12.598
- Counseling hasn't helped?
- No, it has... slowly.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.895
- I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned.
- I heard.

17:17.896 --> 17:21.147
It's improved things some,
but...

17:21.148 --> 17:23.900
...there's
still work to do.

17:23.901 --> 17:26.862
Makes me tired
just to think about it.

17:26.863 --> 17:30.283
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first
president to get a little shut-eye

17:30.284 --> 17:32.160
on one of these sofas.

17:33.411 --> 17:35.244
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.

17:35.245 --> 17:37.455
Do the free world a favor
and get some rest.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.999
- I'll let you be.
- No, stick around.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.171
You should be nearby if President
Qian wants to get on the phone.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.394
I've always loathed
the necessity of sleep.

17:57.395 --> 18:01.772
Like death, it puts the most
powerful men on their backs.

18:07.362 --> 18:09.278
<i>DC Limo and Bus Rental.</i>

18:09.279 --> 18:11.824
I'm calling from the Adohi
Casino's travel department.

18:11.825 --> 18:13.909
We've got a corporate account.

18:13.910 --> 18:15.784
<i>Let's see...</i>
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

18:15.785 --> 18:17.453
<i>we don't have one</i>
<i>in our records.</i>

18:17.454 --> 18:18.665
My mistake.
I must've called

18:18.666 --> 18:21.125
the wrong limo service.
Thank you.

18:27.549 --> 18:29.424
<i>Missouri Bus and Limo.</i>

18:29.425 --> 18:31.635
I'm calling from the Adohi
Casino's travel department.

18:31.636 --> 18:35.514
<i>- You're not Darlene.</i>
- No, Darlene is out sick.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.976
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.

18:37.977 --> 18:39.809
<i>How can I help you, Pam?</i>

18:39.810 --> 18:42.228
We've got a flight
coming in from China tomorrow.

18:42.229 --> 18:44.190
We'll need some transportation.

18:46.317 --> 18:48.278
<i>How many you got coming?</i>

18:48.279 --> 18:49.820
I don't have the manifest
right in front of me.

18:49.821 --> 18:51.947
<i>- The usual?</i>
- That's right.

18:51.948 --> 18:54.782
<i>- So a luxury bus.</i>
- How many does that fit?

18:54.783 --> 18:57.787
<i>Fifty-five, usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.</i>

18:57.788 --> 18:59.413
That's great, thanks.

18:59.414 --> 19:01.832
Do you think
it's really her conscience,

19:01.833 --> 19:04.543
or because the
bill's controversial?

19:04.544 --> 19:06.168
I don't think she would have
threatened to fight us

19:06.169 --> 19:09.173
if all she wanted to do
was avoid controversy.

19:09.174 --> 19:11.258
I'll talk to her.

19:11.259 --> 19:13.885
I really want
this bill to pass.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.055
I know you do, so do I.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.642
We need Jackie more
than ever, Francis.

19:21.852 --> 19:24.105
I'm damaged goods,
this whole Adam thing.

19:24.106 --> 19:26.815
No, you're not.
We fought past that.

19:26.816 --> 19:30.236
Well, there's plenty of people
who still believe it's true.

19:30.237 --> 19:33.406
We'll get it passed, I promise.

19:36.367 --> 19:40.538
- No, thanks.
- Come on. It's no fun doing it alone.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.418
We could just go for a run.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.837
No more runs until the death threats
die down, that's the new rule.

19:49.838 --> 19:51.632
But they let you go
to the office.

19:51.633 --> 19:53.884
Because I was
in a bulletproof car.

19:56.304 --> 19:58.889
Does this mean
we've officially not quit?

19:58.890 --> 20:01.351
We've never been quitters,
have we?

20:03.144 --> 20:06.396
Sir, Mrs. Underwood,
sorry to interrupt.

20:06.397 --> 20:10.232
I was gonna head home, but I'll
stick around if you want me to.

20:10.233 --> 20:12.901
Oh, no. You've been up long
enough. Get some sleep.

20:12.902 --> 20:15.321
I'll be back first
thing in the morning.

20:15.322 --> 20:17.200
Thank you for looking
after me today.

20:17.201 --> 20:21.496
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.

20:25.082 --> 20:28.084
- He's very dedicated.
- He is.

20:28.085 --> 20:30.505
It's rare to find
someone like Edward.

20:33.716 --> 20:36.636
- What?
- You never use his first name.

20:37.887 --> 20:39.639
Oh, did I?

20:42.183 --> 20:45.228
I don't feel right
talking about her like this.

20:45.229 --> 20:48.813
It's just... technically,
she's my boss now.

20:48.814 --> 20:52.233
- There's a certain protocol.
- This is coming directly from Doug.

20:52.234 --> 20:55.779
Which means it's coming directly
from the vice president.

21:00.660 --> 21:05.289
Well, um, I have seen Mr. Danton
around from time to time.

21:05.290 --> 21:08.084
Do you know what he and the
congresswoman were discussing?

21:08.085 --> 21:10.669
No, they were private meetings.

21:10.670 --> 21:14.674
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.

21:14.675 --> 21:19.052
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.

21:19.053 --> 21:21.306
Most of the time
pretty late at night.

21:23.224 --> 21:26.018
Did the money
originate in China?

21:26.019 --> 21:28.396
<i>The money came</i>
<i>from tribal revenue.</i>

21:28.397 --> 21:31.273
<i>As our FEC reports</i>
<i>clearly stated.</i>

21:31.274 --> 21:33.190
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue

21:33.191 --> 21:36.068
come from Chinese visitors
who gambled at your casino?

21:36.069 --> 21:38.279
<i>We have visitors</i>
<i>from all over the world.</i>

21:38.280 --> 21:42.035
I'm speaking specifically about
a businessman named Xander Feng.

21:43.328 --> 21:45.370
I have no idea who that is.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.079
<i>I'm looking at FAA</i>
<i>flight records that show</i>

21:47.080 --> 21:49.206
<i>a private plane he owns</i>
<i>making numerous trips</i>

21:49.207 --> 21:52.501
<i>to Kansas City. And I spoke</i>
<i>with Missouri Bus and Limo,</i>

21:52.502 --> 21:55.338
which has transported Chinese
visitors to your casino.

21:55.339 --> 21:57.214
<i>- Ms. Said--</i>
- Sayyad.

21:57.215 --> 21:59.800
<i>Ms. Sayyad, the only reason</i>
<i>I returned your call</i>

21:59.801 --> 22:02.010
<i>was because you work</i>
<i>for</i> The Telegraph.

22:02.011 --> 22:05.348
<i>It's not every day that I get a
call from a paper as big as yours.</i>

22:05.349 --> 22:08.183
But I don't know what you're trying
to get at here, so if you'll excuse--

22:08.184 --> 22:09.812
What about Raymond Tusk?

22:11.606 --> 22:14.231
- What about him?
- Feng has ties to Tusk.

22:14.232 --> 22:16.776
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.

22:16.777 --> 22:19.987
<i>That looks like foreign money being
used to influence political--</i>

22:19.988 --> 22:22.824
What you're insinuating
is not only wrong,

22:22.825 --> 22:26.035
- it's libelous.
- Not if it's true.

22:26.036 --> 22:28.914
I won't bat an eyelash
getting my attorneys involved.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.500
<i>Tusk made the same threat.</i>

22:31.501 --> 22:33.960
<i>If a man worth 40 billion</i>
<i>dollars doesn't intimidate me,</i>

22:33.961 --> 22:35.672
<i>you certainly don't,</i>
<i>Mr. Lana--</i>

22:37.966 --> 22:43.094
Hello?
He hung up.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.596
<i>I had nothing</i>
<i>to do with it, Raymond.</i>

22:45.597 --> 22:48.223
I can smell the horseshit
through the phone.

22:48.224 --> 22:50.810
<i>You think I'd put</i>
<i>myself at this great a risk?</i>

22:50.811 --> 22:53.103
Desperate men
are capable of anything.

22:53.104 --> 22:56.856
- I want it to go away, just like you do.
- Then pull her back.

22:56.857 --> 22:59.067
I have no control
over the press, Raymond.

22:59.068 --> 23:01.320
<i>You'll destroy</i>
<i>yourself, Frank, not me.</i>

23:01.321 --> 23:03.658
Thank you for that
unsolicited advice.

23:04.993 --> 23:07.034
Work with Doyle,
make sure we have no weak spots.

23:07.035 --> 23:09.205
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?

23:09.206 --> 23:14.418
Well, it looks like Jackie may
be sleeping with the enemy.

23:16.212 --> 23:18.878
Lanagin is correct in saying
we run the risk of libel.

23:18.879 --> 23:20.631
These links
are supported by fact.

23:20.632 --> 23:22.550
Individually, but you can't
complete the circle.

23:22.551 --> 23:24.012
I'm not saying the
headline should read:

23:24.013 --> 23:26.763
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!

23:26.764 --> 23:29.724
Just that we present the landscape
as we currently know it.

23:29.725 --> 23:31.350
We're first and foremost
a financial paper.

23:31.351 --> 23:33.394
Many of our readers
worship Raymond Tusk.

23:33.395 --> 23:34.936
So we just protect him?

23:34.937 --> 23:37.315
We don't insinuate
connections we can't back up.

23:37.316 --> 23:40.401
If there's any basis for litigation, you
can be sure his team will be aggressive.

23:40.402 --> 23:42.612
They've bankrupted
papers before.

23:42.613 --> 23:45.905
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When, and if, you have a story--

23:45.906 --> 23:48.452
Mr. Maxfield,
Raymond Tusk is on the line.

23:49.704 --> 23:51.579
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.

23:51.580 --> 23:53.455
He's specifically
asking for you, sir.

23:53.456 --> 23:55.750
We got off the phone with Lanagin
less than 30 minutes ago.

23:55.751 --> 23:58.168
That means Tusk was the
first call Lanagin made.

23:58.169 --> 24:00.962
Tell him I'll return. Did you
reach out to the White House?

24:00.963 --> 24:02.882
They're not talking to anyone
until after the president

24:02.883 --> 24:04.636
does his press briefing
tomorrow.

24:04.637 --> 24:06.469
All right, walk me through

24:06.470 --> 24:08.598
all of this again,
point by point.

25:02.485 --> 25:05.237
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.

25:06.530 --> 25:09.032
No. What is it?

25:15.414 --> 25:19.625
I'd like to put in a request to be
on your wife's detail full time.

25:19.626 --> 25:21.712
At least until the death threats
quiet down.

25:22.505 --> 25:24.255
That's very thoughtful.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.047
I'll only do it if you approve,
sir.

25:26.048 --> 25:27.967
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.

25:27.968 --> 25:31.096
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.140
I'll let Agent Rockland know.

25:35.351 --> 25:36.976
Sorry for
interrupting you, sir.

25:36.977 --> 25:38.686
You didn't interrupt anything.

25:38.687 --> 25:41.357
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.

25:44.568 --> 25:48.404
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:48.405 --> 25:50.574
You'll never believe
what just happened.

25:50.575 --> 25:53.702
- What?
- Meechum came into the office

25:53.703 --> 25:57.205
and found me
watching something...

25:57.206 --> 26:03.044
- ...other than the news.
- Oh!

26:03.045 --> 26:06.840
- Oh, no.
- He was very professional about it.

26:06.841 --> 26:10.844
- Were you...?
- No, no. I was just watching.

26:10.845 --> 26:13.763
That's really funny.

26:13.764 --> 26:15.806
What about you?
What are you watching?

26:15.807 --> 26:19.395
The video Connor gave me. It's
our first state senate race.

26:19.396 --> 26:20.938
I forgot about that.

26:20.939 --> 26:22.982
So did I, until I found it
in the desk this morning.

26:22.983 --> 26:24.816
Let me see.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.817
<i>...been there, like I have.</i>

26:26.818 --> 26:29.321
<i>Of course, it doesn't hurt to</i>
<i>have a little Texas in them...</i>

26:29.322 --> 26:32.240
My God, look how young we are.

26:32.241 --> 26:33.992
I know.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.868
<i>Everyone here has been</i>
<i>so kind, and so welcoming.</i>

26:35.869 --> 26:38.245
<i>We'll have her rooting</i>
<i>for Clemson before too long.</i>

26:38.246 --> 26:41.042
<i>That's where</i>
<i>I have to draw the line.</i>

26:45.046 --> 26:47.589
Do you miss being with Adam?

26:47.590 --> 26:49.550
Where did that come from?

26:52.679 --> 26:54.387
Miss it? No.

26:54.388 --> 26:57.349
Well, you must, sometimes.

26:59.727 --> 27:03.354
He meant a lot
to me for a while.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.816
But that's done now.

27:07.401 --> 27:09.360
What about you?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.614
What about me?

27:13.490 --> 27:15.702
Are you unsatisfied?

27:18.161 --> 27:20.581
There's just
too much at stake now.

27:20.582 --> 27:22.916
No one we can trust.

27:22.917 --> 27:25.711
We don't have
the freedom we once did.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.011
Maybe it's better this way.

27:33.844 --> 27:35.888
No room for distractions.

27:37.347 --> 27:39.933
I don't mind the sacrifice.

27:39.934 --> 27:41.768
We chose this instead.

27:41.769 --> 27:43.687
<i>I think the one thing</i>
<i>we can agree on</i>

27:43.688 --> 27:45.772
<i>is the ribs here are better.</i>

27:45.773 --> 27:47.731
<i>See, he's just trying</i>
<i>to get under my skin.</i>

27:47.732 --> 27:50.151
<i>No, it's not even debatable...</i>

27:55.365 --> 28:00.495
- How was California?
- Oh...

28:00.496 --> 28:05.000
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.

28:05.001 --> 28:08.670
- Is this the Golden Gate?
- Yes.

28:08.671 --> 28:13.382
I had an etching right there. The
capitol before it was finished.

28:13.383 --> 28:15.718
Took 85 years to complete it.

28:15.719 --> 28:19.513
- How long did it take to complete the bridge?
- About four years.

28:19.514 --> 28:22.975
It opened a few months
after FDR's second inaugural.

28:22.976 --> 28:25.270
There was a man
who got things done.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.856
Strong beliefs
and he stuck to them.

28:27.857 --> 28:29.900
But compromised when he had to.

28:31.653 --> 28:34.277
I assume you're here
to talk about Claire's bill.

28:34.278 --> 28:36.571
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen

28:36.572 --> 28:38.740
cosponsors on either
side of the aisle.

28:38.741 --> 28:41.078
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.

28:41.079 --> 28:45.165
- Except with the language.
- I can explain my thinking,

28:45.166 --> 28:47.082
but I doubt I'll convince you
anymore--

28:47.083 --> 28:50.044
Putting aside the military's
honor, chain of command,

28:50.045 --> 28:51.965
all the things
that you hold dear...

28:54.299 --> 28:57.052
...let's consider
one simple fact.

28:57.053 --> 29:00.430
You wouldn't have this office
if it weren't for me.

29:00.431 --> 29:05.267
I made very clear
that I wouldn't be a puppet.

29:05.268 --> 29:09.691
I'm not trying to pull strings, but
you could show a little gratitude.

29:09.692 --> 29:14.485
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice
President... but not this.

29:14.486 --> 29:17.571
All you're doing is making
the inevitable more difficult.

29:17.572 --> 29:20.242
It's not inevitable. Claire
doesn't have the votes yet.

29:21.911 --> 29:24.078
You really want
to fight us on this.

29:24.079 --> 29:26.121
I don't want
to fight you at all.

29:26.122 --> 29:28.207
Which is why I suggested to
Claire that we sit down--

29:28.208 --> 29:31.501
I neither have the time nor the
inclination to negotiate with you!

29:31.502 --> 29:35.758
Cosponsor the bill, whip the damn
votes, I'm no longer asking.

29:35.759 --> 29:38.552
Then I'm no longer listening.

29:41.847 --> 29:44.806
You don't have just this office
to thank me for.

29:44.807 --> 29:48.143
If you win reelection,
you can thank me for that, too.

29:48.144 --> 29:50.938
Those attack ads didn't just
disappear on their own.

29:50.939 --> 29:54.025
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you ask Remy Danton.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.651
And ask him about Raymond Tusk
while you're at it.

29:56.652 --> 29:59.489
That ought to make for some very
interesting pillow talk.

30:15.005 --> 30:16.757
You keep up the good work,
Nancy.

30:17.758 --> 30:19.466
I will, Mr. Vice President.

30:19.467 --> 30:22.469
I miss having you around,
but you're my eyes and ears now,

30:22.470 --> 30:24.512
otherwise I'd steal
you back in a heartbeat.

30:24.513 --> 30:28.310
Well, thank you, sir. It means
a lot to me that you say that.

30:34.441 --> 30:37.069
- Doug?
- I'm busy.

30:39.863 --> 30:41.740
The story just broke.

30:45.410 --> 30:48.829
They timed it with the
president's press conference.

30:48.830 --> 30:51.206
Connect me with
the vice president.

30:51.207 --> 30:54.334
<i>So the 7th Fleet is</i>
<i>currently positioned near Guam,</i>

30:54.335 --> 30:59.006
<i>where it will remain if China removes its
ships from Japan's sovereign waters.</i>

30:59.007 --> 31:01.758
<i>I've been in frequent touch</i>
<i>with prime minister Oshiro,</i>

31:01.759 --> 31:04.511
<i>and have made personal</i>
<i>overtures to President Qian.</i>

31:04.512 --> 31:07.764
<i>And I remain optimistic</i>
<i>that tensions will be quelled</i>

31:07.765 --> 31:11.185
<i>without any further escalations. So,
with that, I'll take some questions.</i>

31:11.186 --> 31:13.312
<i>- Henry, you first.</i>
<i>- Can you comment</i>

31:13.313 --> 31:15.355
<i>on the</i> Wall Street Telegraph
<i>article--</i>

31:15.356 --> 31:18.733
<i>I was just notified of that</i>
<i>moments before I joined you.</i>

31:18.734 --> 31:20.485
<i>I haven't had a chance to read</i>
<i>it yet. Yeah, Jane.</i>

31:20.486 --> 31:22.280
<i>Mr. President, would</i>
<i>you walk us through</i>

31:22.281 --> 31:24.156
<i>your history with Raymond Tusk?</i>

31:24.157 --> 31:27.617
<i>I'm here to answer questions on</i>
<i>Sino-Japanese relations. Mark.</i>

31:27.618 --> 31:31.412
<i>The article mentions Xander Feng, a
wealthy and influential Chinese business--</i>

31:31.413 --> 31:33.373
<i>Unless this has to do with the</i>
<i>statement I just made--</i>

31:33.374 --> 31:35.375
<i>It does, Mr. President.</i>
<i>Feng has ties</i>

31:35.376 --> 31:37.211
<i>to the standing committee</i>
<i>and we're currently in a</i>

31:37.212 --> 31:39.048
<i>standoff with the Chinese.</i>
<i>Economically--</i>

31:39.049 --> 31:40.716
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

31:42.343 --> 31:45.304
It's not beginning the story
that I fear,

31:45.305 --> 31:47.097
it's not knowing
how it will end.

31:47.098 --> 31:51.184
Everyone is fair game now,
including me.

31:51.185 --> 31:54.728
<i>This is par for the course, what we've
come to expect from President Walker.</i>

31:54.729 --> 31:58.024
<i>Whenever he's selling a shiny new
car, he can't say enough about it.</i>

31:58.025 --> 32:00.775
<i>The engine breaks down,</i>
<i>the transmission gives out,</i>

32:00.776 --> 32:03.987
<i>he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something,</i>

32:03.988 --> 32:07.157
<i>our warranty is the Constitution
of the United States,</i>

32:07.158 --> 32:10.244
<i>and there's no limit on that.</i>
<i>He needs to read the fine print</i>

32:10.245 --> 32:12.620
<i>and start answering</i>
<i>our questions.</i>

32:12.621 --> 32:16.543
<i>If any of this is true, we're
talking Congress, the White House,</i>

32:16.544 --> 32:19.628
<i>both parties...</i>
<i>Now, I'm saying "if,"</i>

32:19.629 --> 32:22.839
<i>but when it looks like dirty money,
and it smells like dirty money,</i>

32:22.840 --> 32:24.799
<i>somebody has probably got dirt</i>
<i>under their nails.</i>

32:24.800 --> 32:27.094
<i>Look, there's no real proof</i>
<i>this money laundering is even--</i>

32:27.095 --> 32:29.637
<i>The connections are troubling,</i>
<i>especially Underwood.</i>

32:29.638 --> 32:32.934
<i>He was the House whip the entire time
Adohi were contributing to the Democrats,</i>

32:32.935 --> 32:35.185
<i>and he's working side by side</i>
<i>with the president now.</i>

32:35.186 --> 32:37.062
<i>The president. So this goes all</i>
<i>the way to the White House?</i>

32:37.063 --> 32:39.314
<i>- It might.
- It's hypothetical. And by the way,</i>

32:39.315 --> 32:41.149
<i>you've cherry-picked the facts</i>
<i>to make your case.</i>

32:41.150 --> 32:43.402
<i>I'm not making a case.</i>
<i>My headline is:</i>

32:43.403 --> 32:46.071
<i>PAC Money Raises Questions.</i>
<i>And it has.</i>

32:46.072 --> 32:48.073
<i>I haven't answered</i>
<i>those questions,</i>

32:48.074 --> 32:50.575
<i>but I think the American people</i>
<i>deserve answers. Don't you?</i>

32:50.576 --> 32:54.537
You can bet your bottom dollar the
attorney general is gonna investigate.

32:54.538 --> 32:58.125
- With the firestorm this is causing in the media--
- What's our course of action?

32:58.126 --> 33:01.253
As your counsel, I would encourage
you not to speak to the press

33:01.254 --> 33:04.547
until we have more information.
As your average citizen,

33:04.548 --> 33:06.841
the longer you wait,
the more suspicious it looks.

33:06.842 --> 33:09.719
If there's been any irregularity,
I had nothing to do with it.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.974
Your friendship with Tusk
implies guilt by association.

33:12.975 --> 33:14.726
Are we presuming guilt
before innocence?

33:14.727 --> 33:17.312
I'm a lawyer,
I presume nothing.

33:17.313 --> 33:19.856
But public opinion
doesn't have a law degree.

33:21.024 --> 33:22.609
Give us a few moments.

33:25.989 --> 33:28.905
I have to advise you not to have
any conversation about this matter

33:28.906 --> 33:31.702
- without me present.
- Your advisement has been noted.

33:31.703 --> 33:33.578
I'll be right outside.

33:37.916 --> 33:39.458
Is this what you were keeping
from me?

33:39.459 --> 33:41.960
We should follow
your counsel's advice

33:41.961 --> 33:44.212
- and not--
- Tell me if it's true, about the money.

33:44.213 --> 33:46.631
With Bill out of the room,
we open ourselves up to--

33:46.632 --> 33:51.388
Damn it, Frank! I've been in the dark
too long on this. That ends now.

33:56.643 --> 33:59.103
I don't know any details.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.938
Feng told me if the Bridge
project got approved,

34:01.939 --> 34:04.941
the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.

34:04.942 --> 34:07.904
Jesus Christ, that connects the
White House directly to the money.

34:07.905 --> 34:12.199
No, sir. You knew nothing,
you still know nothing.

34:12.201 --> 34:14.951
If the DOJ finds any concrete
evidence of foreign money--

34:14.952 --> 34:17.871
That's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.

34:17.871 --> 34:19.956
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.

34:19.956 --> 34:23.710
If the DOJ investigates, it
will only prove your innocence.

34:23.710 --> 34:26.630
Nobody walks away from something
like this without bruises.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.966
Well, bruises you can survive.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.676
I just don't know how we can
avoid it at this point.

34:31.677 --> 34:34.221
Unless you want to accelerate
the process and get rid of it.

34:34.222 --> 34:37.934
We could always have the attorney
general appoint a special prosecutor.

34:37.935 --> 34:40.853
- That's a terrible idea.
- Maybe so.

34:40.853 --> 34:44.063
And given where we are, Frank, I'm not
inclined to follow your suggestions.

34:44.065 --> 34:46.483
Well, I wasn't suggesting it was
something you should do.

34:46.484 --> 34:49.569
Just as a possibility. No, in
fact, I don't think you should.

34:49.570 --> 34:52.197
I think it's better to drag these
things out as long as possible.

34:52.197 --> 34:55.992
- Let the public fatigue on it.
- And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?

34:55.993 --> 34:58.578
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't.

34:58.579 --> 35:01.415
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical
drone strikes in the South China Sea.

35:01.416 --> 35:03.750
I can't be dealing with something
like this for months on end.

35:03.751 --> 35:06.627
Maybe you're right then. A special
prosecutor is the way to go.

35:06.628 --> 35:08.464
I didn't say that, you did.

35:08.465 --> 35:10.757
Oh, no. I just meant in terms
of getting it off your plate.

35:10.758 --> 35:12.967
It wouldn't be on my plate
if you kept me better informed.

35:12.968 --> 35:15.720
I have done nothing but try
to insulate you, sir.

35:15.721 --> 35:17.933
Is that what you call the feeding
frenzy I just went through?

35:20.060 --> 35:23.228
I make this solemn promise
to you, Mr. President.

35:23.229 --> 35:26.940
I will take the fall if it
comes to that, but it won't.

35:26.941 --> 35:30.651
However you decide to deal with this,
I think your instincts are right.

35:30.652 --> 35:33.949
We probably shouldn't
involve a special prosecutor.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.662
Send Bill back in.

35:43.083 --> 35:44.751
You knew about this.

35:46.795 --> 35:48.547
Tusk is a client,
doesn't mean I know everything--

35:48.548 --> 35:52.383
Bullshit. The reason you're
a partner at Glendon Hill

35:52.384 --> 35:54.636
is because you know the
things nobody else does.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.055
What do you want me to say?

35:58.056 --> 36:01.310
- Is it true?
- We don't talk about work.

36:01.311 --> 36:04.352
We're not in bed,
we're in my fucking office.

36:04.353 --> 36:06.354
And in here,
you work for Frank.

36:06.355 --> 36:09.234
- I work for no one but myself.
- Keep telling yourself that.

36:09.235 --> 36:14.905
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for
whoever can pay the highest retainer.

36:14.906 --> 36:18.241
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs,
I'm fully aware and willing,

36:18.242 --> 36:22.039
but you're worse. You're Frank's
bitch and refuse to believe it.

36:22.040 --> 36:25.249
- That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.

36:25.250 --> 36:28.126
Don't turn this. You knew about
the money and you didn't tell me.

36:28.127 --> 36:30.670
Even though it's thrown
my seat into contention.

36:30.671 --> 36:34.215
Let's say there was money,
and let's say I did know,

36:34.216 --> 36:38.346
- what good would it have done?
- It means you were willing to watch me lose!

36:38.347 --> 36:40.514
It means I respected the
boundaries that you demanded.

36:40.515 --> 36:43.891
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different!

36:43.892 --> 36:47.897
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes!

36:47.898 --> 36:50.025
You can't have it both ways.

36:53.070 --> 36:54.530
Were you...?

36:55.447 --> 36:56.739
Was I what?

36:58.325 --> 37:00.410
...fucking me
to get info on Frank?

37:09.752 --> 37:13.089
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.

37:13.090 --> 37:17.259
I care about
you more than I should.

37:17.260 --> 37:19.262
But I'm getting tired
of having to say it.

37:22.015 --> 37:25.766
He's being moved to a federal
psychiatric facility for assessment.

37:25.767 --> 37:29.481
Then a high security detention center
until the official sentencing.

37:29.482 --> 37:31.773
Well, that's good to hear.

37:31.774 --> 37:35.068
The bad news is we don't want you
doing any public events for a while.

37:35.069 --> 37:38.740
My bill's about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.

37:38.741 --> 37:43.327
Your death threats continue to
rise. We can't take the risk.

37:43.328 --> 37:46.954
- Am I even allowed to leave the house?
- Of course.

37:46.955 --> 37:48.917
But we want you
to avoid large crowds.

37:48.918 --> 37:52.545
Our ability to protect--
Mr. Vice President.

37:52.546 --> 37:55.424
- Anything wrong?
- We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood

37:55.425 --> 37:57.592
on her new security protocol.

37:57.593 --> 38:00.596
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.

38:04.891 --> 38:06.767
How did it go?

38:06.768 --> 38:10.313
- He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?

38:10.314 --> 38:14.065
No. It could look like I was
trying to go behind his back.

38:14.066 --> 38:16.817
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.

38:16.818 --> 38:18.572
Hopefully,
he'll disagree with it.

38:19.822 --> 38:21.742
But this could've
been the wrong move.

38:21.743 --> 38:23.951
Well, don't doubt yourself.

38:23.952 --> 38:26.369
Seth has gotten over 3,000
e-mails in the last six hours.

38:26.370 --> 38:29.872
- The phones are overloaded.
- So you ignore all that?

38:29.873 --> 38:32.544
I can't ignore
the Department of Justice.

38:32.545 --> 38:34.212
What can I do?

38:35.464 --> 38:37.507
Come and visit me
when I'm in prison.

38:52.689 --> 38:55.108
You don't have
to stand by that door.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.325
Take a load off.

39:04.326 --> 39:06.828
Thank you, sir, but I'm
supposed to stay on my feet.

39:06.829 --> 39:09.246
Well, I won't tell
if you won't.

39:09.247 --> 39:13.459
And if anybody gives you
any trouble about this,

39:13.460 --> 39:17.297
or anything,
they can talk to me.

39:22.177 --> 39:24.846
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.

39:27.432 --> 39:30.809
It's been strange not having
you around these last few days.

39:30.810 --> 39:32.769
You want me to switch back
to your detail?

39:32.770 --> 39:34.897
No, no. I'm glad
you're with Claire.

39:35.983 --> 39:37.984
I just...

39:37.985 --> 39:42.404
...didn't realize how much I got used
to your company until you were gone.

39:42.405 --> 39:45.742
Protecting her is the same
as protecting you, in my mind.

39:50.747 --> 39:52.081
Oh, come on.

40:07.222 --> 40:11.100
- Why do you do this?
- Do what, sir?

40:12.311 --> 40:14.395
I've always been awestruck,

40:14.396 --> 40:18.524
people who are willing to take
a bullet for someone else.

40:18.525 --> 40:22.904
- That's how I serve my country.
- Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.

40:23.864 --> 40:25.866
And this is my way.

40:29.536 --> 40:32.539
- I haven't finished with this one yet.
- It's not for you.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.666
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.752
It's not for you either.

40:37.753 --> 40:40.213
Well, come on over
and join the party.

40:45.052 --> 40:47.721
Haven't you got sick
of seeing my face yet?

40:47.722 --> 40:49.514
Never, ma'am.

40:52.975 --> 40:57.438
To Meechum,
for his loyalty and service.

40:57.439 --> 40:59.148
To Edward.

41:05.072 --> 41:08.283
I'm on my way
to my lawyer's office, Remy.

41:08.284 --> 41:12.536
That's not where I want to be
when I'd usually be in bed.

41:12.537 --> 41:15.956
I can't stop Frank
from leaking things.

41:15.957 --> 41:20.210
No, but you can make sure
he suffers more than us.

41:20.211 --> 41:25.925
And I say "us," Remy, because your
skin is in this game now, too.

41:25.926 --> 41:28.970
- Are you gonna deny?
<i>- Of course I'm gonna deny.</i>

41:28.971 --> 41:31.513
Every step of this was legal.

41:31.514 --> 41:33.890
They can't prove
the links between them.

41:33.891 --> 41:38.478
<i>- What about Lanagin?</i>
- He'll cooperate. It's Feng we need to worry about.

41:38.479 --> 41:41.065
I'll find a way
to get in touch with him.

41:41.066 --> 41:43.693
<i>We do have one major advantage.</i>

41:43.694 --> 41:48.113
The public can hate me,
but as long as Clayton West

41:48.114 --> 41:51.033
remains profitable, my
stockholders won't care.

41:51.034 --> 41:54.119
Frank doesn't
have the same liberty.

41:54.120 --> 41:59.207
Public opinion can demolish him. You
need to make sure that happens.

41:59.208 --> 42:01.125
I can work with
the Republicans on that.

42:01.126 --> 42:03.210
<i>Well, we'll be under the</i>
<i>magnifying glass too.</i>

42:03.211 --> 42:04.838
<i>This will be a witch hunt.</i>

42:04.839 --> 42:06.758
I'll make sure that they pick
the right targets.

42:08.343 --> 42:10.804
What you need to do
is go after the leadership.

42:10.805 --> 42:15.641
Make them hurt. They'll turn on
Frank to save themselves.

42:15.642 --> 42:18.311
<i>Birch, Womack, Sharp.</i>

42:18.312 --> 42:22.607
<i>Especially Jackie Sharp.</i>
<i>She's his chosen one.</i>

42:24.985 --> 42:29.571
- Remy?
- I heard you. I got my marching orders.

42:29.572 --> 42:32.700
<i>- I'm counting on you.</i>
- I'll deliver.

42:32.701 --> 42:35.536
<i>Let's talk in the morning.</i>

42:35.537 --> 42:38.454
The two names I like the most are
Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.

42:38.455 --> 42:39.998
Gaines has better credentials.

42:39.999 --> 42:41.749
But he's close
to the administration.

42:41.750 --> 42:43.001
I would've made him
a federal judge

42:43.002 --> 42:44.669
if the GOP hadn't blocked it.

42:44.670 --> 42:46.504
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.

42:46.505 --> 42:48.631
- She's more than qualified.
- No baggage there?

42:48.632 --> 42:51.509
- She's more unpredictable.
- I doubt the attorney general

42:51.510 --> 42:53.471
would've put her on his list if
he thought she was a wild card.

42:53.472 --> 42:57.058
Sir, I have to say,
I think this step is premature.

42:57.059 --> 43:00.018
We should hold off and see what
the DOJ does on its own.

43:00.019 --> 43:02.520
I don't want to do it,
Bill, but my fear is this:

43:02.521 --> 43:04.856
if we wait until the water
goes from hot to boiling,

43:04.857 --> 43:06.524
we seem reactionary,
not proactive.

43:06.525 --> 43:09.276
But proactive could
also seem defensive.

43:09.277 --> 43:12.530
Like the suspect that screams "I
didn't do it" before anyone asks.

43:12.531 --> 43:15.659
Aside from that, we simply
haven't had time to prepare.

43:15.660 --> 43:18.118
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- That defeats the purpose.

43:18.119 --> 43:20.079
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.915
- Sir--
- I've made my decision.

43:21.916 --> 43:25.459
Bill, I'd like you to convey my
wishes to the attorney general.

43:25.460 --> 43:28.796
Ultimately, the decision is his. We
can't appear to be pressuring him.

43:28.797 --> 43:31.092
- Of course not.
- Thank you, sir.

43:33.929 --> 43:37.847
The only thing more satisfying than
convincing someone to do what I want,

43:37.848 --> 43:40.266
is failing to persuade them
on purpose.

43:40.267 --> 43:44.812
It's like a "Do Not Enter" sign, it
just begs you to walk through the door.

43:44.813 --> 43:47.023
Doyle's about halfway through
our initial background check.

43:47.024 --> 43:49.108
Every donor,
every political event.

43:49.109 --> 43:50.651
Everything that Dunbar
might be looking into.

43:50.652 --> 43:53.905
- Good. Seth?
- We avoid any official statement,

43:53.906 --> 43:55.740
follow the president's cue.

43:55.741 --> 43:58.076
In the meantime, I'd like to
make some off the record calls.

43:58.077 --> 44:00.620
You welcome the investigation,
it's the right step, et cetera.

44:00.621 --> 44:02.204
Give folks the personal touch.

44:02.205 --> 44:04.373
That's fine, as long
as we don't come off defensive.

44:04.374 --> 44:06.001
I'd like to see a list
of who you'd be calling.

44:06.002 --> 44:07.752
Some of this is gonna be
on the fly,

44:07.753 --> 44:09.629
it'd be great
if I had a little leeway.

44:09.630 --> 44:11.255
Let Seth do his thing, you'll
have your hands full with Doyle.

44:11.256 --> 44:12.506
I'll let you know
who I've called.

44:12.507 --> 44:14.052
All right, let's get to work.

44:22.102 --> 44:23.478
Sir?

44:24.646 --> 44:27.147
Yes, what is it?

44:27.148 --> 44:29.107
I understand that
you need to delegate,

44:29.108 --> 44:30.691
but when you contradict me
in front of Seth,

44:30.692 --> 44:32.276
it compromises
my authority over him.

44:32.277 --> 44:34.280
You can't micromanage,
we have too much to do.

44:34.281 --> 44:36.782
Seth is still new to the team.

44:36.783 --> 44:38.994
I need to make sure that
he's doing his job properly.

44:38.995 --> 44:43.331
- Well, I think he is.
- I'm your fail-safe, sir.

44:43.332 --> 44:45.416
But I can't be that
if you won't let me.

44:52.172 --> 44:53.882
Are you, Doug?

44:53.883 --> 44:58.553
- My failsafe?
- Do you doubt that?

44:58.554 --> 45:01.305
We're flying full throttle
into a hurricane,

45:01.306 --> 45:03.265
and you're talking
office politics

45:03.266 --> 45:07.229
instead of focusing on making
sure we don't get ripped apart.

45:08.773 --> 45:11.232
You're right, sir.

45:11.233 --> 45:13.070
I shouldn't have brought it up.

45:54.695 --> 45:57.946
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.

45:57.947 --> 46:00.574
I told her I was
going for a walk.

46:00.575 --> 46:04.705
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted
her gone, but you have to understand--

46:04.706 --> 46:07.330
She can stay.

46:07.331 --> 46:11.086
- What?
- She doesn't have to leave, she can stay.

46:12.378 --> 46:14.463
I trust you to be smart.

46:19.720 --> 46:20.970
Will you read to me?

46:24.264 --> 46:27.102
- My Bible's inside.
- Doesn't have to be the Bible.

46:27.103 --> 46:30.146
Just pull up something
on your phone.

46:33.942 --> 46:39.655
- Like what?
<i>- A Tale of Two Cities.</i> My mom used to read it to me.

46:51.584 --> 46:55.921
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,

46:55.922 --> 46:58.800
it was the age of wisdom,

46:59.968 --> 47:02.595
it was the age of foolishness,

47:03.930 --> 47:05.514
it was the epoch of belief,

47:05.515 --> 47:08.100
it was the epoch
of incredulity,

47:08.101 --> 47:09.850
it was the season of Light,

47:09.851 --> 47:11.727
it was the season of Darkness,

47:11.728 --> 47:13.313
it was the spring of hope,

47:13.314 --> 47:15.482
it was the winter of despair,

47:15.483 --> 47:17.943
we had everything before us,

47:17.944 --> 47:20.737
we had nothing before us,

47:20.738 --> 47:22.780
we were all going
direct to Heaven,

47:22.781 --> 47:25.034
we were all going
direct the other way."

47:31.833 --> 47:33.376
Hello?

47:40.340 --> 47:42.093
Doug, is that you?

47:45.888 --> 47:47.056
Hello?

47:51.853 --> 47:53.062
Hello?

47:54.647 --> 47:56.274
<i>Doug?</i>

47:59.610 --> 48:02.197
Yes, Doug, it is you.
