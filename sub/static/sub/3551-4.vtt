WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:05.176
BREE DISCOVERED
SHE HAD A ROMANTIC RIVAL.

00:05.176 --> 00:07.038
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
A NEW HOBBY, AND TAKING YOU DOWN

00:07.038 --> 00:09.510
IS AS GOOD AS ANY.
 SUSAN GOT A BONUS.

00:09.510 --> 00:13.044
FOR THE GIRL WHO GETS
THE MOST HITS IN A MONTH.

00:13.044 --> 00:15.146
SINCE THE PRISON
DIDN'T ALLOW CONJUGAL VISITS,

00:15.146 --> 00:18.119
THIS IS OUR WEDDING NIGHT.
 PAUL'S BRIDE SAID NO.

00:18.119 --> 00:22.022
THERE ARE CERTAIN WIFELY DUTIES
THAT I DON'T WANT TO RUSH INTO.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.455
ONCE WE CALL THESE PEOPLE, IT'LL
CHANGE YOUR FAMILY FOREVER.

00:24.455 --> 00:27.128
AND GABY DECIDED TO MEET
HER REAL DAUGHTER.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.499
CALL THEM.

00:33.264 --> 00:35.766
(Mary Alice)
CARLOS SOLIS LOVED HIS WIFE

00:35.766 --> 00:37.438
MORE THAN ANYTHING...

00:37.438 --> 00:40.441
IF THERE'S A WOMAN
ON THIS PLANET WITH BETTER SKIN,

00:40.441 --> 00:42.443
I'D LIKE TO MEET HER.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.045
EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS VAIN...

00:45.045 --> 00:47.678
DO WE HAVE TO GIVE MONEY
TO THE CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY?

00:47.678 --> 00:50.221
I MEAN,
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME SHOW.

00:50.221 --> 00:51.422
SELFISH...

00:53.654 --> 00:55.656
I TOLD YOU TO BUY ME COUTURE!

00:55.656 --> 00:58.259
I CAN'T WEAR OFF-THE-RACK
WITH THESE SHOES!

00:58.259 --> 01:00.661
UGH!

01:00.661 --> 01:03.164
AND SPOILED.
 (sighs)

01:03.164 --> 01:05.266
BUT IN THOSE MOMENTS

01:05.266 --> 01:08.239
WHEN HIS WIFE
WAS SIMPLY VULNERABLE...

01:08.239 --> 01:09.740
YOU OKAY?

01:09.740 --> 01:13.174
CARLOS LOVED HER
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.805
THIS IS WHERE
WE'RE MEETING THEM?

01:14.805 --> 01:16.847
I THINK SO.

01:16.847 --> 01:18.509
(sighs)

01:18.509 --> 01:20.611
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY.

01:20.611 --> 01:22.183
START WITH "HELLO."

01:22.183 --> 01:23.684
AND THEN WHAT?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.686
"THANKS FOR RAISING OUR DAUGHTER
FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.358
HOPE WE DIDN'T RUIN YOURS"?

01:27.358 --> 01:29.120
(sighs) IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

01:30.561 --> 01:33.224
MRS. AND MRS. SOLIS?
I'M HECTOR SANCHEZ.

01:33.224 --> 01:36.127
NICE TO MEET YOU. AND PLEASE,
CALL US CARLOS AND GABRIELLE.

01:36.127 --> 01:38.629
OH, THANK YOU.
UH, WHERE IS...

01:38.629 --> 01:40.631
JUANITA IS AT THE SWING SET
WITH HER SISTER.

01:40.631 --> 01:42.803
WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD
TALK A LITTLE FIRST.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.305
OH. SURE.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.877
UH, MY WIFE IS OVER HERE
WITH OUR...

01:46.877 --> 01:48.539
SHE'S WITH GRACE.

01:48.539 --> 01:51.382
THAT'S HER NAME? GRACE?

01:51.382 --> 01:53.844
YES.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.651
SO HOW ARE YOU AND YOUR WIFE
HANDLING ALL OF THIS?

02:00.651 --> 02:02.653
(sighs)
WE'RE STILL IN SHOCK.

02:02.653 --> 02:04.625
SINCE YOUR LAWYER CALLED US,

02:04.625 --> 02:06.757
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO SLEEP OR EAT.

02:06.757 --> 02:08.758
THIS WHOLE THING
IS SO CRAZY.

02:08.758 --> 02:10.761
WE FEEL THE SAME WAY.

02:10.761 --> 02:12.763
THEY COULDN'T HAVE
SWITCHED OUR BABIES.

02:12.763 --> 02:14.265
IT'S GOT TO BE A MISTAKE.

02:14.265 --> 02:16.267
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE
A BLOOD TEST.

02:16.267 --> 02:17.768
MOM!

02:17.768 --> 02:19.770
I TOLD YOU TO BRING
THE GREEN JACKET!

02:19.770 --> 02:22.673
I CAN'T WEAR RED
WITH THESE SHOES! UGH!

02:22.673 --> 02:26.146
YES, CARLOS SOLIS
LOVED HIS WIFE...

02:26.146 --> 02:28.649
I DON'T THINK
WE'LL BE NEEDING THAT TEST.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.182
(grunts)

02:31.182 --> 02:33.854
AND HE KNEW HER D.N.A.

02:33.854 --> 02:46.837
WHEN HE SAW IT.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.400
IT'S CALLED A PURSE,

02:49.400 --> 02:51.242
AND AS EVERY WOMAN KNOWS,

02:51.242 --> 02:54.505
IT CAN HOLD
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING,

02:54.505 --> 02:58.509
FROM
A PERSONALIZED CELL PHONE...

02:58.509 --> 03:02.583
TO A ROMANCE NOVEL...

03:02.583 --> 03:05.286
TO MUCH-NEEDED MEDICATION.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.787
(pills rattle)

03:06.787 --> 03:09.860
WHATEVER YOU FIND INSIDE,

03:09.860 --> 03:12.793
THERE'S ONE THING
YOU CAN BE SURE OF--

03:12.793 --> 03:17.968
EVERY PURSE SAYS SOMETHING
ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO OWNS IT...

03:17.968 --> 03:19.930
WHETHER SHE KNOWS IT...

03:19.930 --> 03:22.233
OR NOT..

03:22.233 --> 03:24.905
(sighs) CARLOS AND I FEEL LIKE
WE SHOULDN'T TELL THE GIRLS,

03:24.905 --> 03:26.907
YOU KNOW,
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.909
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.981
WE SHOULD PROTECT THEM.

03:30.981 --> 03:33.984
YES, BUT SINCE WE WANNA GET TO
KNOW OUR BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTERS,

03:33.984 --> 03:35.986
WE WERE THINKING
MAYBE THE FAMILIES COULD

03:35.986 --> 03:38.619
GET TOGETHER EVERY NOW AND THEN?
 MAYBE ONCE A MONTH?

03:38.619 --> 03:40.521
MM, THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.593
UH, W-WHAT DO YOU THINK,
CARMEN?

03:42.593 --> 03:44.525
UM, I GUESS.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.257
LOOK AT THEM.

03:46.257 --> 03:48.259
(Hector) YES,
I HAVE A FEELING

03:48.259 --> 03:50.401
THAT THEY WILL BECOME
VERY GOOD FRIENDS.

03:50.401 --> 03:52.903
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THOSE ARE OUR DAUGHTERS?

03:52.903 --> 03:55.536
GRACE LOOKS JUST LIKE ME
WHEN I WAS HER AGE.

03:55.536 --> 03:58.409
AND JUANITA LOOKS SO MUCH
LIKE MY MOTHER.

04:00.010 --> 04:02.012
MOMMY, CAN I HAVE MONEY
FOR ICE CREAM?

04:02.012 --> 04:04.375
YOU JUST HAD LUNCH.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.377
BUT THEY HAVE
CHOCOLATE CHIP.
 GRACE.

04:06.377 --> 04:09.520
OH, LET HER HAVE SOME. IT'S HOT.
COME ON. IT'LL BE MY TREAT.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.623
YOUR PURSE IS BEAUTIFUL.

04:12.623 --> 04:14.985
I KNOW. WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HOLD IT?

04:14.985 --> 04:17.688
UH-HUH.

04:17.688 --> 04:20.831
IT'S SO SOFT.
I BET IT COST A LOT, RIGHT?

04:20.831 --> 04:22.933
GRACE, YOU DON'T ASK
ABOUT MONEY.

04:24.535 --> 04:25.996
I'M SORRY.

04:25.996 --> 04:28.038
OH, THAT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

04:28.038 --> 04:30.671
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IT'S CHANEL.

04:30.671 --> 04:34.845
YOU CAN HAVE ONE OF THESE
BY WORKING VERY HARD...

04:34.845 --> 04:37.478
OR BY MARRYING A MAN
WHO WORKS VERY HARD.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.550
THANK YOU!

04:39.550 --> 04:41.552
WHAT A POLITE LITTLE GIRL.

04:41.552 --> 04:44.555
YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY DONE
A WONDERFUL JOB, MRS. SANCHEZ.

04:44.555 --> 04:46.357
I MEAN, WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT,

04:46.357 --> 04:49.660
BUT I CAN SEE GRACE COULDN'T
HAVE HAD A BETTER MOTHER.

04:49.660 --> 04:52.062
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

04:52.062 --> 04:54.294
UH, Y-YOU'VE DONE
A WONDERFUL JOB WITH JUANITA.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.367
THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I GOT PREGNANT,

04:56.367 --> 04:58.729
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW I WOULD HANDLE
THE WHOLE MOTHERHOOD THING...

04:58.729 --> 04:59.900
MOM.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.973
BUT I THINK I TURNED OUT
TO BE PRETTY GOOD AT IT.

05:02.973 --> 05:04.535
MOM!
 WHAT?!

05:04.535 --> 05:06.807
I NEED MONEY
FOR ICE CREAM.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.609
WHAT IS THE MAGIC WORD?

05:08.609 --> 05:09.910
I DON'T KNOW. "HURRY"?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.942
NOW COME ON.
THE TRUCK'S PULLING AWAY.

05:11.942 --> 05:14.044
"PLEASE."
THE MAGIC WORD IS "PLEASE."

05:14.044 --> 05:17.718
FINE. PLEASE.

05:19.390 --> 05:22.693
WHAT, WE CAN'T AFFORD
MORE THAN ONE SCOOP?

05:25.025 --> 05:26.957
(scoffs)

05:26.957 --> 05:30.060
(chuckles) I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS I SAYING?

05:30.060 --> 05:34.034
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
WHAT A GOOD MOTHER YOU ARE.

05:34.034 --> 05:37.408
(chuckles)

05:39.670 --> 05:42.513
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR TRUCK LOAN.

05:42.513 --> 05:44.515
GOD, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

05:44.515 --> 05:47.518
JUST TWO MONTHS AGO,
WE WERE UP TO OUR NECK IN DEBT.

05:47.518 --> 05:49.520
NOW WE'RE
ONLY UP TO OUR ASS.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.522
IF WE KEEP THIS GOING,

05:51.522 --> 05:54.024
WE COULD REACH FLAT BROKE
IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS.

05:54.024 --> 05:55.526
(knock on door)

05:55.526 --> 05:57.127
HELLO? IT'S MAXINE.

05:57.127 --> 06:00.030
UM, UH, I'M IN HERE
WITH MIKE!

06:00.030 --> 06:02.733
(chuckles) IT'S OPEN!

06:02.733 --> 06:04.695
HELLO, MICHAEL!

06:04.695 --> 06:07.898
LOOK AT THIS PUNIM.

06:07.898 --> 06:10.100
OH, MIKE, IF I WAS
15 YEARS YOUNGER,

06:10.100 --> 06:13.444
I'D RIDE YOU LIKE A HOBO
RIDES A BOXCAR.

06:13.444 --> 06:15.446
(laughs)

06:15.446 --> 06:18.148
THANKS. BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO
FIX THE AIR CONDITIONER.

06:18.148 --> 06:19.980
EH, IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.112
(laughs)
I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOWER.

06:22.112 --> 06:25.716
(lowered voice) I NEED TO
TALK SOME BUSINESS WITH YOU.

06:25.716 --> 06:28.018
ME, TOO.

06:28.018 --> 06:30.390
I JUST BOUGHT A FUR-TRIMMED
TEDDY AND SOME FLOOR POLISH.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.093
TOMORROW IS GONNA BE
A HECK OF A SHOW.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.666
FANTASTIC.

06:35.666 --> 06:38.629
I THINK YOU SHOULD QUIT.
 WHAT?

06:38.629 --> 06:40.801
THE WEB SITE'S
GOING THROUGH SOME CHANGES.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.803
I'VE TAKEN ON SOME PARTNERS

06:42.803 --> 06:45.906
WHO ARE PUMPING A LOT OF CASH
INTO THE BUSINESS,

06:45.906 --> 06:47.908
AND THEY'RE
RUNNING THE SHOW NOW,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.740
AND THEY WANT
A HUGE U.S. PRESENCE.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.912
NO.
NO, NO, YOU PROMISED ME

06:51.912 --> 06:53.984
THAT NO ONE HERE
WOULD EVER SEE ME.

06:53.984 --> 06:57.047
I DID, AND THAT'S WHY
YOU NEED TO GET OUT NOW.

06:57.047 --> 06:59.089
BUT MIKE AND I ARE
JUST GETTING BACK ON TRACK.

06:59.089 --> 07:00.921
YESTERDAY, WE GOT
OUR FIRST WATER BILL

07:00.921 --> 07:04.525
THAT DIDN'T
COME WITH A THREAT.
 HONEY, I'M SORRY.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.696
(sighs)

07:05.696 --> 07:08.028
WELL, HOW LONG DO I HAVE
TILL ALL THIS HAPPENS?

07:08.028 --> 07:11.031
A COUPLE OF WEEKS,
A MONTH TOPS.

07:11.031 --> 07:14.465
(sighs)

07:14.465 --> 07:17.468
OKAY. I'LL WORK
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE LAST DAY.

07:17.468 --> 07:20.711
GIVE ME DOUBLE SHIFTS,
EXTRA SHOWS. I'LL DO ANYTHING.

07:20.711 --> 07:22.873
YOU GOT IT.

07:22.873 --> 07:24.044
(sighs)

07:25.646 --> 07:27.648
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, HONEY.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.650
NO ONE WILL EVER WEAR

07:29.650 --> 07:31.952
THE RUBBER GLOVES
AND THE FISHNETS LIKE YOU DO.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.786
(sighs)

07:35.786 --> 07:37.958
(crying)

07:37.958 --> 07:40.761
(sighs) OKAY, WE GET IT.
YOU'RE UNHAPPY.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.033
WE GOT IT IN EVERY AISLE
 AT THE MARKET,

07:43.033 --> 07:45.195
WE GOT IT FOUR TIMES
 DURING THE NIGHT,

07:45.195 --> 07:48.198
AND WE GET IT NOW!
 MOM, I'LL PUT
THE GROCERIES AWAY.

07:48.198 --> 07:49.870
(stops crying)
 OH. NO.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.872
(lowered voice)
STOP. FREEZE.

07:51.872 --> 07:55.245
DO NOTHING.
NO SUDDEN MOVEMENTS.

07:55.245 --> 07:58.478
(whispers)
THE EYES ARE CLOSING.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.751
(whispers)
BUT WE BOUGHT ICE CREAM.

08:00.751 --> 08:01.952
LET IT MELT.

08:01.952 --> 08:03.754
(telephone rings)
 (inhales sharply)

08:03.754 --> 08:04.955
(ring)
 OOH!

08:04.955 --> 08:06.957
(ring)
 SHH! SHH!

08:06.957 --> 08:10.791
(normal voice) HELLO? HELLO?
YES, THIS IS SHE.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.193
OH. OF COURSE I DID.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.996
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
I-I WILL BE BACK.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.128
(beep, receiver clatters)
 EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:18.128 --> 08:21.231
NO, I LEFT MY LICENSE
AT THE STORE,

08:21.231 --> 08:23.233
SO I HAVE TO DRAG PAIGE
BACK THERE,

08:23.233 --> 08:27.077
WHICH WILL LEAD TO
ANOTHER 2-HOUR SCREAMING FIT.
 (keys jangle)

08:27.077 --> 08:30.040
IF I DIDN'T LOOK SO GOOD IN
THAT PHOTO, I'D GET A NEW ONE.

08:30.040 --> 08:34.144
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE THE BABY
WITH ME?
 OH, HONEY, I DON'T KNOW.

08:34.144 --> 08:36.145
MOM, YOU LEAVE HER
WITH THE BOYS,

08:36.145 --> 08:38.048
AND THEY DON'T
CHANGE HER DIAPER

08:38.048 --> 08:40.020
UNTIL IT WEIGHS
AS MUCH AS SHE DOES.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.121
GOOD POINT.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.124
MM...

08:44.995 --> 08:48.629
I'M BACK.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.761
I'M BACK! EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:50.761 --> 08:53.864
SHE WOKE UP,
SO I WENT WITH PLAN "B."

08:53.864 --> 08:57.738
YOU TRADED HER IN
FOR A QUIETER BABY?
 NOPE. I CHANGED HER DIAPER.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.570
NOW WE'RE DOING
A LITTLE FLOOR TIME.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.211
AW.

09:01.211 --> 09:04.144
YOU CHANGED HER DIAPER.
 (keys clatter)

09:04.144 --> 09:06.917
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
HOW TO DO THAT?

09:06.917 --> 09:09.179
I'VE SEEN YOU DO IT
A HUNDRED TIMES.

09:09.179 --> 09:13.123
YOU'RE SO GOOD WITH HER.

09:14.284 --> 09:16.156
HEY.

09:18.088 --> 09:21.091
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
ABOUT ME TAKING A QUICK SHOWER

09:21.091 --> 09:24.094
TO WASH SOME OF THIS VOMIT
OUT OF MY HAIR... (chuckles)

09:24.094 --> 09:26.166
FROM YESTERDAY?

09:26.166 --> 09:29.700
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BATH? LIGHT
ONE OF THOSE SCENTED CANDLES.

09:31.341 --> 09:34.044
WHOEVER RAISED YOU
DID A BRILLIANT JOB!

09:34.044 --> 09:36.707
MWAH!

09:41.912 --> 09:43.313
SHOOT.

09:43.313 --> 09:45.055
I'M OUT OF ASPIRIN.

09:45.055 --> 09:47.958
DO YOU HAVE A HEADACHE?

09:47.958 --> 09:49.990
UH, NO. MY BACK IS
A LITTLE SORE.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.993
YOU DO REALIZE, DARLING, THAT
YOUR BACK WOULDN'T HURT SO MUCH

09:52.993 --> 09:55.295
IF YOU WEREN'T SLEEPING
ON A COUCH EVERY NIGHT.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.597
UH, N-NO.
UH, THE COUCH IS FINE.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.599
UM, I JUST PULLED A MUSCLE.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.931
HMM.

10:00.931 --> 10:02.232
(knocks)
 HEY THERE.

10:02.232 --> 10:03.934
LEE.
 CONGRATULATIONS.

10:03.934 --> 10:07.838
YOU ARE THE PROUD NEW OWNER
OF YOUR OLD HOUSE.

10:07.838 --> 10:10.280
YOU BOUGHT YOUR OLD HOUSE?

10:10.280 --> 10:12.612
ACTUALLY, LEE,
WHY DON'T WE TALK LATER?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.614
OKAY.
WELL, HERE ARE YOUR KEYS,

10:14.614 --> 10:17.247
YOUR COMPLIMENTARY
ENDANGERED SPECIES CALENDAR,

10:17.247 --> 10:19.289
AND A KITCHEN MAGNET
WITH MY FACE ON IT.

10:19.289 --> 10:21.291
YES, I KNOW
I LOOK CROSS-EYED,

10:21.291 --> 10:24.224
BUT THEY ASSURE ME THEY WILL
CORRECT THAT IN THE NEXT BATCH.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.156
(chuckles) ENJOY.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.237
WHY WOULD YOU BUY
THAT HOUSE?

10:37.237 --> 10:39.239
OUR LEASE WON'T BE UP
FOR A YEAR.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.241
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A GOOD INVESTMENT.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.944
BUT WHY BUY... THAT ONE?

10:43.944 --> 10:45.946
THERE ARE OTHER HOMES FOR SALE
AROUND HERE.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.247
ESCROW'S CLOSED, BETH.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.820
I SEE NO POINT
IN DISCUSSING THIS FURTHER.

10:49.820 --> 10:52.322
YOU WON'T DISCUSS IT?

10:52.322 --> 10:54.184
I'M YOUR WIFE.

10:54.184 --> 10:57.187
ISN'T IT CONVENIENT HOW
DURING THE DAY YOU'RE MY WIFE,

10:57.187 --> 10:59.760
BUT AT NIGHT,
YOU TURN BACK INTO A HOUSEGUEST?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.200
NO, NO, NO.
 MM.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.903
DON'T LOOK AT THEM YET.
THEY'RE NOT DONE.

11:12.903 --> 11:15.976
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE SHUTTERS.
IT'S ABOUT OUR... DATE FRIDAY.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.278
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.280
WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU YET,

11:20.280 --> 11:22.282
BUT I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON SOMETHING

11:22.282 --> 11:24.354
THAT I'M PRETTY...
STOKED ABOUT.

11:24.354 --> 11:26.356
(laughs)
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LOVELY.

11:26.356 --> 11:28.688
I, TOO, AM... STOKED.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.192
YOU GOT A LITTLE PAINT...

11:39.469 --> 11:42.172
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 SHH!

11:44.204 --> 11:47.137
(sighs) ARE YOU
SPYING ON BREE AGAIN?

11:47.137 --> 11:50.140
(sighs) WHY WOULD HE WANT HER
WHEN HE COULD HAVE ME?

11:50.140 --> 11:53.383
SHE'S WAY TOO OLD FOR HIM.
 YOU'RE THE EXACT SAME AGE.

11:53.383 --> 11:56.386
I AM NOT. I'M ONLY THIRTY--
 ARE YOU GONNA LIE
ABOUT YOUR AGE?

11:56.386 --> 11:58.018
WE WERE COLLEGE ROOMMATES.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.719
ALL RIGHT, DAMN IT.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.721
BESIDES,
BREE'S ALWAYS LOOKED YOUNG.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.024
WHEN SHE USED TO GO OUT
WITH HER GRANDKID,

12:04.024 --> 12:06.026
PEOPLE WOULD THINK
HE WAS HER SON.

12:06.026 --> 12:09.059
WAIT. BREE'S A GRANDMOTHER?

12:09.059 --> 12:11.762
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.742
OKAY, SWEETIE, I AM TAKING
THE BABY OVER TO GABY'S.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.176
THE GIRLS ARE MEETING FOR POKER.
I'LL BE BACK IN A FEW.

12:26.176 --> 12:29.149
YOU'RE NOT STAYING?
 NO. I'M REALLY JUST DOING
A DRIVE-BY.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.852
LAST WEEK, PAIGE SPIT UP
ON GABY'S COUCH,

12:31.852 --> 12:34.254
SO NOW SHE'S PRETTY MUCH
BABY NON GRATA.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.426
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE HER WITH ME?

12:36.426 --> 12:38.428
THEN YOU CAN STAY
FOR YOUR GAME.

12:38.428 --> 12:42.092
BUT WE USUALLY PLAY FOR A COUPLE
OF HOURS. GIVE ME A KISS. MWAH.
 MWAH.

12:42.092 --> 12:45.035
SO? YOU'LL BE RIGHT NEXT DOOR
IF I NEED YOU.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.997
OH, DON'T TOY WITH ME.

12:46.997 --> 12:50.100
I'M OPERATING ON TWO HOURS
OF SLEEP. I'M VULNERABLE.

12:50.100 --> 12:53.303
GO. WE'LL BE FINE.

12:53.303 --> 12:55.305
I LOVE WATCHING
MY BABY SISTER.

12:55.305 --> 12:57.007
(whispers) OH!
 IT'S FUN.

12:57.007 --> 12:59.279
(normal voice)
PENNY LYNN SCAVO,

12:59.279 --> 13:03.153
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY
MY FAVORITE. MWAH!

13:03.153 --> 13:04.284
HEE HEE!

13:04.284 --> 13:07.888
WE ARE GONNA LEAVE EVERYTHING
TO YOU IN OUR WILL.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.890
KEEP IN MIND WE'RE POOR,

13:09.890 --> 13:12.492
SO IT'S REALLY MORE OF
A SYMBOLIC GESTURE. (blows kiss)

13:12.492 --> 13:15.125
(door closes)

13:19.830 --> 13:21.331
LISTEN, GUYS,

13:21.331 --> 13:23.233
UH, BEFORE WE START...

13:23.233 --> 13:26.136
I'VE BEEN KEEPING SOMETHING
FROM YOU,

13:26.136 --> 13:28.138
BUT I'M GONNA TELL YOU

13:28.138 --> 13:30.410
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY DEAREST
AND OLDEST FRIENDS.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.412
WELL, I'VE ONLY KNOWN YOU
TWO WEEKS,

13:32.412 --> 13:36.186
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE
AND TELL YOU TO LEAVE.

13:36.186 --> 13:40.420
SEE THIS PICTURE?
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER GRACE.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.026
OH, MY GOD, GABY.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.158
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

13:48.158 --> 13:50.400
I'D BE OUT OF MY MIND.
HOW CAN YOU FUNCTION?

13:50.400 --> 13:53.463
(sighs) WELL, WE WERE
KNOCKED SIDEWAYS AT FIRST,

13:53.463 --> 13:55.835
BUT SINCE WE MET GRACE,
IT'S BEEN A BLESSING.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.837
THANK GOD THE PARENTS
ARE LOVELY.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.840
I MEAN, THIS IS THE KIND
OF THING YOU SEE ON THE NEWS.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.975
WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT THIS?
 VERY FEW PEOPLE, AND I NEED
YOU GUYS TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

14:04.975 --> 14:07.147
WELL, OF COURSE
WE'LL BE DISCREET.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.179
DEFINITELY,
FOR JUANITA'S SAKE.

14:12.082 --> 14:14.084
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

14:14.084 --> 14:17.427
UP UNTIL TODAY,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUANITA.

14:17.427 --> 14:18.458
MM.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.231
SO... TELL US
WHAT IT WAS LIKE.

14:21.231 --> 14:23.163
AMAZING.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.465
I LOOKED INTO HER EYES
AND FELT THAT PULL.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.068
WELL, YOU CARRIED HER
FOR NINE MONTHS.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.439
(chuckles)

14:29.439 --> 14:33.073
THERE'S THIS ONE THING SHE DID
THAT WAS INCREDIBLY MOVING.

14:33.073 --> 14:36.106
SHE CAME UP TO ME...

14:36.106 --> 14:38.108
(whispers) AND WITHIN
TWO SECONDS OF TOUCHING MY BAG,

14:38.108 --> 14:40.580
SHE KNEW IT WAS EXPENSIVE.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.612
NOW THAT IS
A HALLMARK MOMENT.

14:42.612 --> 14:44.454
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:44.454 --> 14:46.456
WHEN I WAS A KID,

14:46.456 --> 14:49.459
I USED TO SNEAK "VOGUES"
OUT OF MY AUNT'S HAIR SALON

14:49.459 --> 14:52.092
AND MAKE MY OWN
HIGH FASHION PAPER DOLLS.

14:52.092 --> 14:55.025
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE THAT KID,

14:55.025 --> 14:58.668
WITH HER FACE PRESSED AGAINST
THE DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW.

14:58.668 --> 15:00.570
GRACE IS ME AT HER AGE.

15:02.572 --> 15:05.105
SO I DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING
FOR HER.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.236
(bag rustles)

15:08.208 --> 15:11.281
HER OWN LITTLE STARTER CHANEL.

15:14.644 --> 15:17.147
(sighs)

15:17.147 --> 15:20.220
YOU ARE
THE BEST MOTHER EVER.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.092
(chuckles)

15:37.007 --> 15:38.308
PAUL?

15:40.070 --> 15:42.072
PAUL?
 (sighs)

15:43.573 --> 15:46.276
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 PLEASE GO HOME.

15:46.276 --> 15:50.450
I JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND,
THAT'S ALL.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.452
ARE WE GOING TO MOVE HERE?

15:52.452 --> 15:53.723
NO.

15:53.723 --> 15:58.028
THEN WHY WOULD YOU BUY
THIS HOUSE?

15:58.028 --> 16:02.232
IT MUST BE FILLED WITH
SO MANY UNPLEASANT MEMORIES.

16:03.693 --> 16:06.536
I DON'T SEE
ANY UNPLEASANT MEMORIES.

16:08.198 --> 16:10.140
I SEE THE COUCH

16:10.140 --> 16:13.643
WHERE MY WIFE AND I WOULD SIT
AND HAVE OUR MORNING COFFEE.

16:16.446 --> 16:20.150
I SEE THE CHRISTMAS TREE
IN THE CORNER BY THE FIREPLACE.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.414
I SEE THE CHAIR

16:24.414 --> 16:28.488
WHERE I WOULD SIT
AND READ STORIES TO MY SON.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.023
I WAS LOVED IN THIS HOUSE.

16:33.023 --> 16:35.025
I HAD A REAL MARRIAGE HERE.

16:35.025 --> 16:37.497
OUR MARRIAGE IS REAL, PAUL.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.029
IT'S JUST...

16:39.029 --> 16:40.670
THIS IS HARD FOR ME,

16:40.670 --> 16:44.234
AND--AND YOU KEEPING THINGS
FROM ME

16:44.234 --> 16:47.277
DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.144
(sighs)

16:56.746 --> 16:59.089
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:59.089 --> 17:01.221
THERE SHOULD BE
NO SECRETS BETWEEN US.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.799
SECRETS ARE WHY
THIS HOUSE IS EMPTY RIGHT NOW.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.267
(squeaks)

17:17.267 --> 17:19.739
SORRY I'M LATE,
BUT I THINK YOU'LL BE HAPPY

17:19.739 --> 17:22.412
WHEN YOU HEAR WHY.

17:22.412 --> 17:24.414
BLACK EYED PEAS.
ROW 15, CENTER.

17:24.414 --> 17:26.116
HOW COOL IS THAT?

17:26.116 --> 17:28.578
WOW, THAT'S JUST...

17:28.578 --> 17:30.120
WOW. (chuckles)

17:30.120 --> 17:32.822
YOU LIKE THEM, RIGHT?
 OF COURSE.

17:32.822 --> 17:36.386
YOU SOUND A LITTLE...
UNDERWHELMED.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.588
NO. NOT AT ALL.

17:38.588 --> 17:40.260
I LIVE TO ROCK.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.531
(doorbell rings)

17:41.531 --> 17:44.394
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AS OLD
AS YOU MIGHT THINK.

17:44.394 --> 17:47.097
(squeaks)

17:47.097 --> 17:49.199
GRANDMA!
 SURPRISE!

17:49.199 --> 17:51.271
(gasps)

17:52.502 --> 17:54.504
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:54.504 --> 17:56.676
VISITING.
WE'RE HERE ALL WEEKEND.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.808
UM... HELLO.

17:58.808 --> 18:00.580
HI.
 KEITH,

18:00.580 --> 18:02.582
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER DANIELLE
AND THIS IS MY--

18:02.582 --> 18:05.155
HER, UH, SON BENJAMIN.

18:05.155 --> 18:08.388
DANIELLE, THIS IS MY, UM...
FRIEND KEITH.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.390
WE WERE JUST... GOING OUT.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.163
GRANDMA! GRANDMA!
LOOK WHAT I BOUGHT YOU!

18:13.163 --> 18:14.564
IT'S SLIPPERS.

18:14.564 --> 18:17.267
MY GRANDMA HAS BAD CIRCULATION.
DON'T YOU, GRANDMA?

18:17.267 --> 18:19.269
PLEASE STOP CALLING ME THAT!

18:19.269 --> 18:21.401
YOU... PRECIOUS CHILD.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.504
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GUYS CAME ALL THIS WAY.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.676
YOU SHOULD
SPEND TONIGHT TOGETHER.

18:26.676 --> 18:29.439
NO. NO, NO, NO. IF--IF YOU GUYS
HAD PLANS, YOU SHOULD GO.

18:29.439 --> 18:31.141
WE'LL BE FINE.

18:31.141 --> 18:33.313
BREE, THERE'S--THERE'S NOTHING
MORE IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.315
WE'LL GO OUT ANOTHER TIME.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.316
(sighs)

18:36.316 --> 18:38.288
YOU'RE VERY SWEET.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.121
NICE MEETING BOTH OF YOU.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.254
UH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

18:44.254 --> 18:47.157
UH, I GUESS I HEARD WRONG.

18:47.157 --> 18:49.729
YOU SEEM TO BE
BOUNCING BACK JUST FINE.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.162
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:52.162 --> 18:53.463
WHEN YOUR FRIEND CALLED,

18:53.463 --> 18:56.636
SHE SAID YOU WERE HAVING
A HARD TIME SINCE ORSON LEFT.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.669
UH, BY ANY CHANCE,

18:59.669 --> 19:02.342
IS THIS FRIEND NAMED RENEE?

19:02.342 --> 19:05.915
SHE SENT US FIRST CLASS TICKETS.
I WISH I HAD A FRIEND LIKE THAT.

19:05.915 --> 19:09.649
OH, TRUST ME, YOU DON'T.

19:15.285 --> 19:16.786
(horn honks)

19:21.261 --> 19:25.335
OH, COME ON. COME ON.

19:25.335 --> 19:27.337
(people speaking indistinctly)

19:27.337 --> 19:28.638
WHAT THE HELL?

19:30.700 --> 19:32.672
(beep)

19:32.672 --> 19:34.173
MAXINE, PICK UP.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.175
THEY'RE ALREADY PUTTING UP
A BILLBOARD.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.678
YOU--YOU SAID THEY WEREN'T GONNA
START ADVERTISING

19:38.678 --> 19:40.680
FOR A COUPLE OF--OH, MY GOD!

19:42.752 --> 19:44.414
(gasps)
 (tires peal)

19:44.414 --> 19:46.486
(horn honks, tires screech)

19:46.486 --> 19:49.219
WAIT! WAIT! STOP!
 HUH?

19:49.219 --> 19:52.222
YOU--YOU CAN'T PUT THAT
UP THERE! THAT'S ME.
 SO?

19:52.222 --> 19:53.923
SO--SO PEOPLE WILL SEE!

19:53.923 --> 19:55.425
MY FRIENDS WILL SEE!

19:55.425 --> 19:57.427
LADY, WITH A BODY LIKE THAT,

19:57.427 --> 19:59.699
NO ONE'S EVEN GONNA NOTICE
YOU HAVE A HEAD.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.202
NO, NO, NO! NO, NO! YOU CAN'T!
NO, STOP! OH!

20:05.204 --> 20:08.938
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN'?
 PROTECTING MY DIGNITY!

20:11.841 --> 20:13.212
OH.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.316
(sighs)

20:18.518 --> 20:22.221
HEY THERE, MRS. McCLUSKEY.
NICE DAY, ISN'T IT?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.924
I'VE SEEN BETTER.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:24.924 --> 20:26.426
YOU'RE DIRECT.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.428
I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.430
TRUTH IS, I WAS WONDERING

20:30.430 --> 20:32.962
IF YOU HAD ANY INTEREST
IN SELLING YOUR HOME.

20:32.962 --> 20:34.964
WELL, GET READY
TO LOVE ME AGAIN.

20:34.964 --> 20:36.005
NO.

20:36.005 --> 20:38.538
AREN'T YOU TIRED
OF CARING FOR THIS PLACE--

20:38.538 --> 20:40.710
THE BIG LAWN
AND ALL THESE STAIRS?

20:40.710 --> 20:43.643
YEAH, YOUR CONCERN
IS TOUCHING.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.545
WHAT'S YOUR GAME HERE?

20:45.545 --> 20:47.547
I JUST LOVE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
SO MUCH,

20:47.547 --> 20:49.919
I'D HATE TO SEE THIS HOUSE
FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS

20:49.919 --> 20:51.421
AFTER YOU'RE GONE.

20:51.421 --> 20:52.952
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.454
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT,

20:54.454 --> 20:56.626
BUT THE YEARS DO HAVE
A WAY OF FLYING BY,

20:56.626 --> 20:58.988
AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANNA UNLOAD THIS PLACE

20:58.988 --> 21:01.030
WHILE YOU STILL HAVE
THE UPPER HAND.

21:01.030 --> 21:02.592
UPPER HAND?

21:02.592 --> 21:04.294
YES.

21:04.294 --> 21:06.896
RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE SHARP AS A TACK.

21:06.896 --> 21:08.898
BUT ONE DAY,
YOUR HIP WILL BREAK

21:08.898 --> 21:10.970
OR YOU'LL SUFFER
A MASSIVE STROKE,

21:10.970 --> 21:14.273
AND THE DOCTORS WILL SAY YOU CAN
NO LONGER LIVE ON YOUR OWN.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.275
AND WHEN THAT DAY COMES,

21:16.275 --> 21:19.048
POTENTIAL BUYERS WHO DON'T
CARE ABOUT YOU LIKE I DO

21:19.048 --> 21:21.050
WILL KNOW
THAT YOU'RE DESPERATE.

21:21.050 --> 21:23.052
THEY'LL SMELL THE BLOOD
IN THE WATER.

21:23.052 --> 21:25.555
PEOPLE WILL START
SMELLING YOUR BLOOD

21:25.555 --> 21:28.057
IF YOU DON'T
GET OFF MY PORCH.

21:28.057 --> 21:30.990
ALL RIGHT.
DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.563
MY OFFER STILL STANDS.

21:33.563 --> 21:34.994
AS I SAID,

21:34.994 --> 21:37.997
IT ALL COMES FROM MY GREAT LOVE
FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:39.629 --> 21:43.072
BE CAREFUL ON THOSE STAIRS NOW.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.707
(Paige crying)

21:47.707 --> 21:50.540
OH! LOOK WHO'S MISSING
HER BIG SISTER.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.011
OH.
 OH, OH, OH.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.843
(crying subsides)

21:53.843 --> 21:55.845
THERE. YOU ARE REALLY
SO GOOD WITH HER.

21:55.845 --> 21:58.087
LISTEN, I'M GONNA TAKE A QUICK
JOG. BE BACK IN 20 MINUTES.

21:58.087 --> 21:59.589
MOM.
 YEAH?

21:59.589 --> 22:02.091
I'VE GOT A TEST TODAY.
I CANNOT BE LATE FOR THE BUS.

22:02.091 --> 22:04.354
I HEAR YA LOUD AND CLEAR.
I'LL BE BACK IN 15.

22:04.354 --> 22:06.356
YOU MIGHT WANNA
SMELL HER DIAPER.

22:06.356 --> 22:08.358
I THINK SHE LEFT YOU
A LITTLE PRESENT. MWAH.

22:08.358 --> 22:10.029
(resumes crying)

22:10.029 --> 22:11.601
(door opens and closes)

22:11.601 --> 22:13.102
(panting)

22:13.102 --> 22:15.064
HEY, LYNETTE?

22:15.064 --> 22:17.066
UM, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

22:17.066 --> 22:18.067
SURE.

22:18.067 --> 22:20.410
OH. YOU'RE JOGGING AGAIN.

22:20.410 --> 22:22.341
WHERE'S, UH, THE BABY?

22:22.341 --> 22:26.546
UH, PENNY IS WATCHING HER.
IT IS THE MOST AMAZING THING.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.048
ONLY WHEN YOU'VE SPAWNED
AS MUCH AS I HAVE

22:29.048 --> 22:31.050
DO YOU LEARN
THE GLORIOUS TRUTH--

22:31.050 --> 22:33.783
THE OLDER ONES CAN WATCH
THE YOUNGER ONES.

22:33.783 --> 22:36.025
BABIES HAVING BABIES--
 BAD.

22:36.025 --> 22:39.389
BABIES RAISING BABIES--
GENIUS!

22:39.389 --> 22:40.930
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

22:40.930 --> 22:43.032
(panting)
YOU DON'T LOOK HAPPY.

22:43.032 --> 22:45.395
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO TALK.

22:45.395 --> 22:46.966
OKAY.

22:49.038 --> 22:52.101
SHE FLEW THEM HERE FIRST CLASS?
THAT IS VINTAGE RENEE.

22:52.101 --> 22:54.974
YES, A VORACIOUS LIBIDO
AND UNLIMITED FUNDS--

22:54.974 --> 22:57.647
A DEADLY COMBINATION.

22:57.647 --> 22:59.979
OH!

22:59.979 --> 23:02.882
AND NOW SHE'S TAKING KEITH
TO DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.955
HOW DID YOU FIND THAT OUT?
 WELL, HE CALLED TO MAKE
SURE IT WAS OKAY--

23:05.955 --> 23:08.458
WHICH, OF COURSE, IT ISN'T.
BUT WHAT COULD I SAY?

23:08.458 --> 23:09.959
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

23:09.959 --> 23:12.492
WAIT TILL
SHE'S CROSSING THE STREET

23:12.492 --> 23:15.565
AND THEN RUN HER OVER.
 NO, I'M TOO FOND OF MY CAR.

23:15.565 --> 23:17.567
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT BACK
SOMEHOW.

23:17.567 --> 23:19.569
IT'S THE ONLY THING
RENEE UNDERSTANDS.

23:19.569 --> 23:22.171
BUT HOW? I MEAN,
YOU KNOW HER BETTER THAN I DO.

23:22.171 --> 23:24.173
WHAT COULD I DO
TO HUMILIATE HER?

23:24.173 --> 23:25.505
(gasps) OH!

23:25.505 --> 23:28.137
SHE ONCE SLEPT
WITH A RODEO CLOWN...
 (laughs)

23:28.137 --> 23:31.080
BUT HE'S A SENATOR NOW. UH...

23:31.080 --> 23:34.043
OH, SHE'S GOT
THIS REALLY WEIRD BELLY BUTTON.

23:34.043 --> 23:36.045
BUT BY THE TIME
HE FINDS THAT OUT,

23:36.045 --> 23:38.988
THEY'RE ALREADY
GETTING IT ON. UH...

23:38.988 --> 23:40.990
(laughs)
SHE USED TO FREAK OUT

23:40.990 --> 23:44.153
WHENEVER "THE WIZARD OF OZ"
WAS ON TV.
 WHY?

23:44.153 --> 23:46.155
MM, I THINK IT WAS
THE MUNCHKINS.

23:46.155 --> 23:48.157
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT LITTLE PEOPLE

23:48.157 --> 23:50.159
THAT GIVES HER
THE HEEBIE-JEEBIES.

23:50.159 --> 23:52.201
OH, CRAP! PENNY'S GONNA
BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

23:52.201 --> 23:53.933
SORRY I COULDN'T HELP.

23:55.735 --> 23:59.008
OH, NO. YOU HELPED.

23:59.008 --> 24:01.210
(crunching)

24:02.812 --> 24:03.873
PENNY!

24:03.873 --> 24:06.215
I'M SORRY! I FORGOT MY PHONE!

24:06.215 --> 24:09.819
UH, GRAB YOUR STUFF,
AND I'LL DRIVE YOU!

24:09.819 --> 24:10.980
WHA--

24:12.482 --> 24:14.924
(gasps)

24:14.924 --> 24:17.156
WHERE'S MY BABY?

24:21.230 --> 24:24.564
STOP BREATHING ON MY SISTER!

24:32.201 --> 24:33.943
(children speaking indistinctly)

24:33.943 --> 24:35.905
HI. I'M LYNETTE SCAVO.

24:35.905 --> 24:38.247
I NEED TO FIND
MY DAUGHTER PENNY.

24:38.247 --> 24:40.179
YEAH.
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.181
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
IS IN THE BACK.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.213
OH. THANK YOU.

24:56.896 --> 25:00.099
YOU'RE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.104
SO...

25:05.104 --> 25:07.076
YOU LEFT
YOUR 2-MONTH-OLD BABY

25:07.076 --> 25:09.709
IN THE CARE
OF YOUR 11-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.081
WHAT CAN I SAY?

25:12.081 --> 25:14.243
I'M NOT ONE
OF THOSE HELICOPTER PARENTS.

25:14.243 --> 25:15.945
(chuckles)

25:18.888 --> 25:21.220
COME ON.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.853
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I AM RAISING FIVE KIDS.

25:23.853 --> 25:27.056
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HARD THAT IS.

25:32.702 --> 25:35.034
EIGHT?

25:36.606 --> 25:39.709
WELL, CLEARLY,
YOU'RE VERY COMPETITIVE.

25:39.709 --> 25:41.711
I TALKED TO PENNY.

25:41.711 --> 25:43.713
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW

25:43.713 --> 25:46.215
SHE'S HELPING YOU OUT
MORE THAN YOU REALIZE.

25:46.215 --> 25:48.177
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:48.177 --> 25:51.180
DO YOU KNOW PENNY TAKES
THE BABY MONITOR TO BED WITH HER

25:51.180 --> 25:53.883
SO SHE CAN GET UP
FOR THE FEEDINGS?

25:53.883 --> 25:55.725
SHE DOES?

25:55.725 --> 25:57.156
AS A RESULT,

25:57.156 --> 25:59.759
THE POOR GIRL IS EXHAUSTED.

25:59.759 --> 26:02.161
SHE FELL ASLEEP
IN SOCIAL STUDIES YESTERDAY.

26:02.161 --> 26:05.164
I HAD NO IDEA.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.966
OH, MY GOSH.

26:06.966 --> 26:10.339
YES, I WILL TALK TO PENNY
WHEN SHE GETS HOME,

26:10.339 --> 26:12.341
AND I WILL FIX THIS.

26:12.341 --> 26:15.244
YES, THAT WOULD BE NICE.

26:15.244 --> 26:17.747
OKAY.

26:17.747 --> 26:20.279
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ENOUGH WITH THE JUDGMENTAL TONE.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.783
COME ON. WHO AMONG US
IS A PERFECT MOTHER?

26:33.923 --> 26:36.165
(knocks on door)

26:36.165 --> 26:37.967
GABY.

26:37.967 --> 26:39.969
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

26:39.969 --> 26:41.631
YEAH.
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

26:41.631 --> 26:43.673
I WAS JUST HOPING
GRACE WOULD BE HOME.

26:43.673 --> 26:45.635
I THOUGHT WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO CALL FIRST

26:45.635 --> 26:47.777
IF WE WANTED TO SEE THE KIDS.

26:47.777 --> 26:50.710
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.211
UH, IS SHE HERE?

26:52.211 --> 26:53.843
NO.

26:53.843 --> 26:56.846
OKAY. WELL, COULD YOU
GIVE THIS TO HER FOR ME?

27:01.691 --> 27:04.654
(sighs) THANK YOU,
BUT GRACE ALREADY HAS A PURSE.

27:04.654 --> 27:06.796
REALLY? IS IT CHANEL?

27:06.796 --> 27:08.828
NO. WE BOUGHT IT
AT A FLEA MARKET FOR $2,

27:08.828 --> 27:10.830
AND SHE'S VERY HAPPY
WITH IT.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.832
I KNOW,
BUT DON'T YOU THINK

27:12.832 --> 27:15.134
SHE'D LIKE THIS ONE
A LITTLE BETTER? (chuckles)

27:15.134 --> 27:17.667
NOT IF SHE NEVER SEES IT.

27:17.667 --> 27:20.840
DON'T YOU THINK I WOULD LIKE
TO GIVE MY CHILDREN NICE THINGS?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.311
WE'RE NOT LIKE YOU.

27:22.311 --> 27:25.975
WE CAN'T AFFORD LUXURIES. WE CAN
BARELY AFFORD THE NECESSITIES.

27:25.975 --> 27:28.217
LOOK, IF YOU GUYS
NEED HELP...

27:28.217 --> 27:32.321
WHAT WE NEED IS FOR YOU
 TO LET US BE WHO WE ARE,

27:32.321 --> 27:34.954
NOT WHO YOU ARE.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.385
GOOD-BYE, GABY.

27:36.385 --> 27:39.158
PLEASE, CALL NEXT TIME.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.991
(door slams)

27:41.991 --> 27:43.132
(scoffs)

27:43.132 --> 27:46.165
(sighs deeply)
YOU SAID I HAD A MONTH.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.237
I SAID
I THOUGHT IT WAS A MONTH.

27:48.237 --> 27:51.670
IT'S THE INTERNET.
EVERYTHING MOVES VERY FAST.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.143
HOW MANY BILLBOARDS
ARE THERE?

27:54.143 --> 27:57.046
THEY TALKED ABOUT A BIG
AD CAMPAIGN, SO I GUESS A LOT.

27:57.046 --> 27:59.048
YOU HAVE GOT TO CALL THEM.

27:59.048 --> 28:02.782
GET THEM TO STOP IT, OR AT LEAST
PUT SOME OTHER GIRL UP THERE.

28:02.782 --> 28:03.953
SOMETHING!

28:03.953 --> 28:05.955
HONEY, I TRIED TO WARN YOU.

28:05.955 --> 28:08.087
IT'S BEYOND MY CONTROL NOW.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.819
PLEASE HELP ME.

28:09.819 --> 28:13.162
WHAT IF MIKE SEES ME
SPLAYED ACROSS THAT BILLBOARD?

28:13.162 --> 28:16.796
(gasps) HE'S GONNA RECOGNIZE
THOSE PANTIES!

28:16.796 --> 28:19.428
HE GAVE THEM TO ME
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY!

28:19.428 --> 28:21.700
OH!

28:21.700 --> 28:24.373
I'LL MAKE A CALL.

28:24.373 --> 28:26.305
OH!

28:26.305 --> 28:28.307
(sighs)
 (sighs)

28:31.911 --> 28:33.212
(door closes)

28:40.189 --> 28:42.892
I'M SORRY I TOOK THE BABY
TO SCHOOL.

28:42.892 --> 28:45.895
I HAD A MATH TEST,
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LATE.

28:45.895 --> 28:47.196
HEY, SWEETIE. HEY. HEY.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.200
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.203
I DID.

28:54.203 --> 28:56.435
COME HERE. SIT DOWN.

29:05.014 --> 29:07.316
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN
TAKING THE BABY MONITOR

29:07.316 --> 29:09.448
INTO YOUR ROOM AT NIGHT.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.480
JUST SO YOU CAN SLEEP.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.183
OHH. (sighs)

29:14.183 --> 29:15.955
I APPRECIATE THAT,

29:15.955 --> 29:18.027
AND I APPRECIATE HOW OFTEN

29:18.027 --> 29:20.329
YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING AFTER
YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

29:20.329 --> 29:23.262
WELL, I KNOW HOW YOU LIKE
TO GO SEE YOUR FRIENDS

29:23.262 --> 29:25.995
AND GO JOGGING AND STUFF.

29:25.995 --> 29:27.266
YEAH, I DO.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.800
AND YOU'RE DIFFERENT
WHEN YOU GET TO DO THOSE THINGS.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.873
YOU LAUGH MORE.
YOU'RE NOT AS CRANKY.

29:33.873 --> 29:37.006
YOU STAY UP LATE
AND PLAY BOARD GAMES WITH US.

29:37.006 --> 29:40.009
I LIKE THAT MOMMY BETTER.

29:40.009 --> 29:42.551
OH.

29:42.551 --> 29:45.915
I LIKE THAT MOMMY BETTER,
TOO.

29:45.915 --> 29:49.118
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR JOB
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

29:49.118 --> 29:52.822
YOUR JOB IS TO...

29:52.822 --> 29:56.225
WATCH TELEVISION
AND EAT WAY TOO MUCH CANDY.

29:56.225 --> 30:00.229
AND MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE
THAT'S ALL YOUR JOB IS.

30:00.229 --> 30:02.331
OKAY.

30:02.331 --> 30:04.904
(kisses)

30:06.335 --> 30:09.338
OFF YOU GO. (chuckles)

30:13.012 --> 30:14.213
(sighs)

30:14.213 --> 30:16.015
THAT...

30:16.015 --> 30:17.516
WAS REALLY SWEET.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.218
I KNOW.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.220
GET ME A NANNY.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.351
WHAT?

30:22.351 --> 30:24.193
I AM DROWNING HERE.

30:24.193 --> 30:26.996
YOU HEARD WHAT PENNY SAID.
I'M NOT MYSELF ANYMORE.

30:26.996 --> 30:29.959
AND WHEN I'M NOT
TAKING IT OUT ON THE KIDS,

30:29.959 --> 30:33.532
I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEM.
SO I NEED HELP.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.534
HOW ABOUT
IF I PITCH IN MORE?

30:35.534 --> 30:38.037
OH, TOM.

30:38.037 --> 30:42.441
WHAT A LOVELY, HOLLOW OFFER
THAT YOU'LL NEVER BACK UP.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.443
GET ME A NANNY.

30:52.281 --> 30:54.483
YOU BOUGHT AN 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL
A $1,400 PURSE?

30:54.483 --> 30:57.957
OH, LIGHTEN UP. IT'S NOT LIKE
I GOT HER THE MATCHING WALLET.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.588
SO WHAT DID CARMEN SAY?

30:59.588 --> 31:01.590
SHE WENT ALL "GRAPES OF WRATH"
ON ME,

31:01.590 --> 31:04.433
'CAUSE GOD FORBID THAT WOMAN LET
HER DAUGHTER HAVE NICE THINGS.

31:04.433 --> 31:07.366
"THAT WOMAN" IS HER MOTHER,
AND I'M WITH HER ON THIS.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.538
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO GIVE GRACE EXPENSIVE GIFTS.

31:09.538 --> 31:11.540
YES, I DO.
 WHY?

31:11.540 --> 31:13.943
BECAUSE SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE ALL THIS STUFF!

31:13.943 --> 31:15.945
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
GIVE IT TO HER.

31:15.945 --> 31:17.947
THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT US
TO LOOK FOR HER,

31:17.947 --> 31:20.309
BECAUSE WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN ONCE WE FOUND HER.

31:20.309 --> 31:22.311
BUT YOU LOOKED,
AND WE MET HER,

31:22.311 --> 31:24.313
AND NOW WE'RE
FALLING IN LOVE WITH THIS GIRL.

31:24.313 --> 31:26.315
AND IF YOU SPOOK THESE PEOPLE,

31:26.315 --> 31:28.988
THEY CAN TAKE HER AWAY FROM US
FOREVER.

31:35.524 --> 31:38.297
MORNING, MRS. McCLUSKEY.
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

31:38.297 --> 31:40.229
I FEEL GREAT.
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

31:40.229 --> 31:41.900
OH. OH--WHAT?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.902
JUST HAD MY ANNUAL PHYSICAL.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.205
DOC SAYS I'M GONNA
BE AROUND FOR YEARS.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.376
OH.

31:47.376 --> 31:50.079
SO YOU CAN TELL
THAT VULTURE HUSBAND OF YOURS

31:50.079 --> 31:52.581
HE'LL HAVE TO PICK
AT SOMEONE ELSE'S CARCASS.

31:52.581 --> 31:55.914
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:57.546 --> 31:59.488
SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD.

31:59.488 --> 32:02.091
I'M MAKING STEW.

32:02.091 --> 32:05.294
SO... HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

32:05.294 --> 32:06.455
FINE.

32:06.455 --> 32:10.599
ANYTHING INTERESTING HAPPEN?

32:10.599 --> 32:12.231
NO, NOT REALLY.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.266
YOU DIDN'T...

32:17.266 --> 32:19.338
TALK TO ANYONE?

32:19.338 --> 32:22.371
WHO WOULD TALK TO ME?

32:22.371 --> 32:25.014
I'M GONNA GO WASH UP.

32:32.221 --> 32:34.323
(resumes chopping)

32:38.257 --> 32:42.331
(Asian music playing)

32:42.331 --> 32:45.534
YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE
 THE SEA URCHIN.

32:48.097 --> 32:49.168
(sniffs)

32:49.168 --> 32:50.269
(clears throat)

32:50.269 --> 32:52.271
LOOKS A LITTLE SKETCHY.

32:52.271 --> 32:55.274
MOST OF THE FISH I EAT
COMES IN A BASKET WITH FRIES.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.746
(laughs) YOU'RE FUNNY.

32:57.746 --> 33:00.379
AND YOU EAT OUT OF A BASKET.
 (grunts)

33:00.379 --> 33:02.311
I LIKE THAT.

33:02.311 --> 33:05.014
MM.
 (utensil clatters,
feet patter rapidly)

33:09.258 --> 33:11.260
(sighs)
 EVERYTHING OKAY?

33:11.260 --> 33:12.991
(chuckles)

33:12.991 --> 33:15.394
I JUST THOUGHT I SAW...

33:15.394 --> 33:17.696
(sighs) NEVER MIND.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.998
SO... ANYWAY,

33:19.998 --> 33:22.771
I THOUGHT AFTER DINNER
WE COULD GO TO A CLUB.

33:22.771 --> 33:24.773
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF JAZZ?

33:24.773 --> 33:28.607
I THINK IT'S
THE SEA URCHIN OF MUSIC.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.280
(laughs)
 (feet patter rapidly)

33:31.280 --> 33:32.781
(gasps loudly)

33:32.781 --> 33:35.414
OKAY, UM, DID YOU SEE THAT?

33:35.414 --> 33:37.346
SEE WHAT?

33:37.346 --> 33:38.687
(gasps)

33:38.687 --> 33:41.590
IT WAS PROBABLY NOTHING.
(shaky voice) UM...

33:41.590 --> 33:43.292
I THOUGHT I SAW--

33:43.292 --> 33:45.054
AAH! OH!

33:45.054 --> 33:46.255
OH!

33:46.255 --> 33:48.257
(laughs) OKAY, YOU'RE...

33:48.257 --> 33:49.728
YOU'RE JUST A KID.

33:49.728 --> 33:52.061
(panting)

33:52.061 --> 33:54.103
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

33:54.103 --> 33:56.535
I'M SO SORRY.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.238
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
I'M ODD.

33:59.238 --> 34:02.111
Y-YOU SEE, WHEN...
I WAS A CHILD,

34:02.111 --> 34:03.742
THERE WAS THIS INCIDENT

34:03.742 --> 34:05.814
AT THE CIRCUS.

34:05.814 --> 34:07.316
AND EVER SINCE THEN,

34:07.316 --> 34:10.349
I HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN TERRIFIED OF--

34:10.349 --> 34:12.481
HEY! DON'T I KNOW YOU?

34:12.481 --> 34:15.284
(screaming)

34:15.284 --> 34:18.527
(panting) GET HIM AWAY!
GET HIM AWAY! GET HIM AWAY!

34:18.527 --> 34:20.289
WHAT'S WRONG?!

34:20.289 --> 34:23.592
IS HE THERE WITH HIS TINY HANDS?
I CAN'T LOOK AT HIS TINY HANDS!

34:26.764 --> 34:30.239
AAH!

34:30.239 --> 34:32.601
I AM--I AM SO SORRY.

34:32.601 --> 34:35.304
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
SHE'S DOING.

34:35.304 --> 34:36.445
IT'S OKAY.

34:36.445 --> 34:40.809
OBVIOUSLY, I MADE A MISTAKE.

34:40.809 --> 34:44.152
(pants) OH, MY GOD. DID HE GO?
I CAN'T LOOK.

34:44.152 --> 34:46.255
HE'S GONE.

34:46.255 --> 34:48.487
SO COME DOWN.

34:48.487 --> 34:51.659
EVERYONE IS STARING.

34:51.659 --> 34:53.391
(chuckles)

34:53.391 --> 34:56.864
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THE LOOK ON HER FACE.

34:56.864 --> 34:59.868
WELL, I COULDN'T SEE HER,
BUT I CERTAINLY HEARD HER...

34:59.868 --> 35:03.332
(whispers)
AND IT WAS MAGNIFICENT.

35:03.332 --> 35:07.436
HAPPY TO HELP OUT.
BYE, BREE. SEE YA IN CHURCH.

35:12.141 --> 35:14.343
$9,000?

35:14.343 --> 35:18.387
HEY, MY PARTNERS SPENT A LOT OF
MONEY PRINTING THOSE BILLBOARDS.

35:18.387 --> 35:20.389
AND THEY'LL AGREE
NOT TO PUT THEM UP,

35:20.389 --> 35:22.391
BUT THEY ARE NOT GONNA
EAT THE COST.

35:24.453 --> 35:27.226
HONEY, I DID THE BEST
I COULD.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.898
I TALKED THEM DOWN
FROM $12,000.

35:29.898 --> 35:31.800
IT'S STILL A HUGE HIT.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.263
I MEAN, IT PUTS US
RIGHT BACK WHERE WE WERE

35:34.263 --> 35:36.235
BEFORE I STARTED DOING
THIS STUFF.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.466
I KNOW.

35:37.466 --> 35:41.610
AND WHAT'S MIKE GONNA SAY WHEN
HE NOTICES THE MONEY IS MISSING?

35:41.610 --> 35:45.544
OH, GOD.
I HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT.

35:47.476 --> 35:49.778
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST LET THEM
PUT UP THE BILLBOARDS.

35:49.778 --> 35:52.581
AT LEAST THEN WHEN HE KILLS ME,
I'LL BE FAMOUS.

35:52.581 --> 35:54.883
YOU KNOW,
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.

35:54.883 --> 35:56.555
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

35:56.555 --> 36:00.759
WELL, YOU COULD EARN
THAT MONEY BACK, AND FAST, TOO.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.431
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO...

36:04.333 --> 36:06.765
NEVER MIND.
FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.

36:06.765 --> 36:09.498
NO, NO. WHAT?
WHAT--WHAT IS IT?

36:09.498 --> 36:12.571
WELL, THERE ARE OTHER SERVICES
OUR WEB SITE PROVIDES--

36:12.571 --> 36:14.573
THINGS I'VE KEPT HIDDEN
FROM YOU

36:14.573 --> 36:16.605
BECAUSE OF THE BOUNDARIES
YOU'VE SET.

36:16.605 --> 36:19.208
BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GO

36:19.208 --> 36:21.610
BEYOND THOSE BOUNDARIES...

36:21.610 --> 36:24.553
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
PROSTITUTION?

36:24.553 --> 36:26.355
GOD, NO!

36:26.355 --> 36:28.357
NOTHING LIKE THAT!

36:28.357 --> 36:32.891
JUST PRIVATE
ONSCREEN INTERACTIONS

36:32.891 --> 36:37.266
OF A... RACIER NATURE.

36:37.266 --> 36:39.328
HOW RACY?

36:39.328 --> 36:42.200
HOW MUCH MONEY
DO YOU WANNA MAKE?

37:12.331 --> 37:13.602
(squeaks)

37:13.602 --> 37:15.434
HOW DARE YOU.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.436
GOOD MORNING, RENEE.

37:17.436 --> 37:20.409
HOW DARE YOU EXPLOIT
A TRAUMATIC CHILDHOOD MEMORY.

37:20.409 --> 37:24.343
YES, I HEARD YOU HAD SOME SORT
OF EPISODE WITH A LITTLE PERSON.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.345
OH, LOOK.
HE FOLLOWED YOU HOME.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.847
(gasps)

37:31.720 --> 37:34.423
VERY FUNNY.
I WONDER HOW KEITH WILL REACT

37:34.423 --> 37:37.426
WHEN I TELL HIM IT WAS YOU
 WHO RUINED OUR DATE.

37:37.426 --> 37:39.428
ABOUT THE SAME
AS WHEN HE FINDS OUT

37:39.428 --> 37:41.590
YOU USED MY GRANDSON
TO RUIN OURS.

37:41.590 --> 37:45.263
(car door closes)

37:45.263 --> 37:47.396
OH. HERE'S KEITH NOW.

37:47.396 --> 37:50.399
WHY DON'T WE ASK HIM
 WHO HE WANTS TO BE WITH?

37:50.399 --> 37:52.040
WE CAN'T...

37:52.040 --> 37:54.403
PUT HIM ON THE SPOT
LIKE THAT.

37:54.403 --> 37:56.405
BREE, YOU'RE GETTING ALL RED.

37:56.405 --> 37:58.907
IS THAT A HOT FLASH
OR YOU JUST LOSING YOUR NERVE?

37:58.907 --> 38:00.749
(knock on door)

38:00.749 --> 38:02.511
(door squeaks open)
 HEY.

38:02.511 --> 38:05.554
I WAS GONNA FINISH UP
WITH THOSE SCONCES.

38:05.554 --> 38:07.486
(sighs)

38:07.486 --> 38:09.518
EVERYTHING OKAY HERE?

38:09.518 --> 38:11.420
NOT EXACTLY.

38:11.420 --> 38:12.391
UH...

38:12.391 --> 38:14.823
CAN WE ASK YOU SOMETHING?

38:14.823 --> 38:17.926
IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN...

38:17.926 --> 38:20.028
FOREST GREEN OR BROWN

38:20.028 --> 38:22.571
FOR THE TRIM,
WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER?

38:25.634 --> 38:28.377
FOREST GREEN... I GUESS.

38:28.377 --> 38:31.380
GREAT. THEN WHY DON'T YOU, UH,
RUN DOWN TO THE HARDWARE STORE

38:31.380 --> 38:33.382
AND HAVE THEM
MIX YOU UP A BATCH?

38:33.382 --> 38:34.583
SCOOT.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.317
(sighs)

38:40.519 --> 38:43.492
WHAT'S THE MATTER, BREE?
AFRAID YOU'LL LOSE?

38:43.492 --> 38:45.754
YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:45.754 --> 38:48.527
I THINK I AM.

38:48.527 --> 38:49.828
HE'S ALL YOURS.

38:49.828 --> 38:53.562
WELL, THAT'S NOT ANY FUN.
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED HIM.

38:53.562 --> 38:56.405
I DO, BUT I DON'T GET
HIS REFERENCES.

38:56.405 --> 38:58.567
I CAN'T STAY UP LATE
LIKE HE DOES.

38:58.567 --> 39:00.439
I'M BEING SILLY.

39:00.439 --> 39:03.512
I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THOSE CLICHéS
PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF--

39:03.512 --> 39:06.475
THE DESPERATE,
PREDATORY DIVORCéE.

39:06.475 --> 39:08.377
YOU MEAN LIKE ME?

39:08.377 --> 39:10.479
WELL, YEAH.

39:10.479 --> 39:13.351
DO YOU KNOW WHY
PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF US?

39:13.351 --> 39:14.883
THEY'RE JEALOUS,

39:14.883 --> 39:18.487
BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE THE GUTS
TO GO AFTER WHAT WE WANT.

39:20.689 --> 39:23.392
YOU THINK HE CAN
MAKE YOU HAPPY?

39:23.392 --> 39:26.495
I THINK SO.

39:33.802 --> 39:37.045
THEN GO FOR IT.

39:37.045 --> 39:38.707
MY GIFT TO YOU.

39:38.707 --> 39:39.778
(chuckles)

39:39.778 --> 39:42.481
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO NICE
TO ME?

39:42.481 --> 39:45.684
BASED ON MY DINNER
UNDER THE RAINBOW LAST NIGHT,

39:45.684 --> 39:49.387
I'D RATHER HAVE YOU AS A FRIEND
THAN AN ENEMY.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.889
NOW GO.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.693
(squeaks)
 (sighs)

39:54.693 --> 39:57.996
KEITH, HANG ON!
I THINK I'LL JOIN YOU!

40:04.773 --> 40:05.974
(chuckles)

40:05.974 --> 40:08.907
UH, REALLY NICE OF YOU
TO HAVE US OVER.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.910
MAYBE NEXT TIME
YOU CAN COME TO OUR HOUSE.
 ABSOLUTELY.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.912
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S GREAT

40:13.912 --> 40:15.914
THAT OUT OF
THIS UNFORTUNATE SITUATION,

40:15.914 --> 40:17.916
WE COULD ALL END UP
BEING FRIENDS.

40:17.916 --> 40:18.917
(clink)

40:18.917 --> 40:20.749
YES.
WE'RE VERY LUCKY PEOPLE.

40:20.749 --> 40:24.052
(Grace) BET YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!
BET YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!

40:24.052 --> 40:26.154
(laughing)

40:28.056 --> 40:31.560
SO NOW WE PINCH OFF
A SMALL PIECE OF MASA,

40:31.560 --> 40:34.202
AND YOU ROLL IT
INTO A BALL.

40:34.202 --> 40:35.704
IS THIS BIG ENOUGH?

40:35.704 --> 40:38.737
(laughs) IT'S PERFECT.
AY. (kisses)

40:41.439 --> 40:43.572
I REALLY LOVE YOUR HOUSE,
MRS. SOLIS.

40:43.572 --> 40:46.615
OH, WELL, THANK YOU, HONEY.

40:46.615 --> 40:49.447
WOULD YOU LIKE A TOUR?

40:49.447 --> 40:51.520
UH-HUH.
 COME ON.

40:55.053 --> 40:59.057
WOW. IT'S SO BIG.

40:59.057 --> 41:02.060
YOU HAVE A TV IN YOUR BEDROOM?

41:02.060 --> 41:03.191
LUCKY.

41:03.191 --> 41:06.464
YES, WE ARE VERY LUCKY.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.667
IS THAT A JEWELRY BOX?

41:10.198 --> 41:12.040
UH-HUH.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.042
YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK?

41:14.042 --> 41:15.243
YEAH.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.077
IT'S ALL SO PRETTY.
 (chuckles)

41:19.077 --> 41:22.210
I CAN'T WAIT TILL I GROW UP
SO I CAN HAVE BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

41:24.583 --> 41:26.254
YOU LIKE THAT?

41:29.518 --> 41:33.662
IT'S A GIFT I BOUGHT MYSELF WITH
MY FIRST BIG MODELING CHECK.

41:36.825 --> 41:40.098
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.
YOU DESERVE BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.232
I DON'T KNOW.
MY MOM MIGHT GET MAD.

41:44.232 --> 41:48.076
THEN WE'LL MAKE IT...
(whispers) OUR LITTLE SECRET.

41:49.638 --> 41:51.640
THANK YOU.

41:53.241 --> 41:56.084
I WANT A PURSE LIKE THAT
SOMEDAY.

41:59.548 --> 42:02.120
WELL, THEN I'M GONNA
MAKE SURE YOU GET IT.

42:05.153 --> 42:07.295
IT'S CALLED A PURSE,

42:07.295 --> 42:09.527
AND AS EVERY WOMAN KNOWS,

42:09.527 --> 42:12.260
IT CAN HOLD
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING...

42:14.302 --> 42:18.066
FROM A BOTTLE FOR A BABY...

42:18.066 --> 42:22.611
TO A CHECK FOR PROTECTION...

42:25.774 --> 42:29.818
TO A GIFT FOR A NEW FRIEND.

42:29.818 --> 42:33.121
WHATEVER YOU FIND INSIDE,

42:33.121 --> 42:37.756
THERE'S ONE THING
YOU CAN BE SURE OF...

42:37.756 --> 42:44.062
EVERY PURSE SAYS SOMETHING
ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO OWNS IT...

42:44.062 --> 42:48.336
WHETHER SHE KNOWS IT OR NOT.
