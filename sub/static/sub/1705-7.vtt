<i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:08.838 --> 00:11.672
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:11.674 --> 00:13.674
<i>Pan Am flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:13.676 --> 00:15.042
<i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:15.044 --> 00:17.812
<i>in Africa, Europe and</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:17.814 --> 00:20.514
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:20.516 --> 00:22.083
<i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.085 --> 00:23.818
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:23.820 --> 00:25.386
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:25.388 --> 00:26.554
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:26.556 --> 00:28.522
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.524 --> 00:30.925
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:30.927 --> 00:33.394
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:33.396 --> 00:34.528
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:34.530 --> 00:37.164
...until something stops him.

00:37.166 --> 00:40.000
<i>It was right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes,</i>

00:40.002 --> 00:41.669
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

00:41.671 --> 00:44.705
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:44.707 --> 00:47.208
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:47.210 --> 00:51.178
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:57.052 --> 00:59.253
<i>You're the smartest</i>
<i>and the dumbest fucking person</i>

00:59.255 --> 01:01.422
<i>I've ever known.</i>

01:01.424 --> 01:03.057
<i>I'm not the
one who got it wrong.</i>

01:03.059 --> 01:05.292
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who got it right.</i>

01:09.064 --> 01:10.931
<i>Take 'em.</i>

01:10.933 --> 01:12.767
<i>Take 'em all.</i>

01:19.854 --> 01:22.916
Homeland - 3x07
"Gerontion"

01:24.613 --> 01:26.547
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:27.917 --> 01:29.583
<i>I spoke to the
President yesterday.</i>

01:29.585 --> 01:33.587
He's exploring some changes
in intelligence practice.

01:33.589 --> 01:35.656
I won't temper my views
just to get your support

01:35.658 --> 01:37.458
for my confirmation
as Director.

01:37.460 --> 01:40.161
I'm the one getting
nominated as Director.

01:42.430 --> 01:44.565
The Agency is being driven
into the fucking ground.

01:44.567 --> 01:46.400
The hope is that you
are the reformer

01:46.402 --> 01:48.402
your record in the Senate
would indicate.

01:48.404 --> 01:51.739
So, then, you agree
that change is in order?

01:51.741 --> 01:52.940
Yes, I do.

01:52.942 --> 01:54.441
Is that Javadi?

01:54.443 --> 01:56.944
In a French restaurant
in Tehran with their wives.

01:56.946 --> 01:58.412
We were young
intelligence officers

01:58.414 --> 02:00.014
during the dying
days of the Shah.

02:00.016 --> 02:02.917
I watched the man I thought
I knew become an animal.

02:02.919 --> 02:05.119
So this operation
is your revenge?

02:05.121 --> 02:06.654
Revenge was when I helped
his wife and son

02:06.656 --> 02:09.256
<i>escape to the West</i>
<i>four months later.</i>

02:09.258 --> 02:10.591
I need your eyes on Carrie.

02:10.592 --> 02:12.660
We dangled her to draw
the Iranians out.

02:12.662 --> 02:14.595
<i>Javadi himself.</i>

02:14.597 --> 02:16.597
<i>Carrie Mathison.</i>

02:16.599 --> 02:18.132
Are we completely alone now?

02:18.134 --> 02:19.767
No one is listening.

02:19.769 --> 02:22.169
It's time we talk
about Nasser Hejazi.

02:22.171 --> 02:26.006
Whose name you used to embezzle
more than $45 million.

02:26.008 --> 02:28.876
You are now an enemy
of your own state.

02:28.878 --> 02:30.644
So why am I not
arrested already?

02:30.646 --> 02:32.813
Saul would like
to talk to you first.

02:32.815 --> 02:34.148
He will turn, won't he?

02:34.150 --> 02:36.684
Turning an intelligence officer
against his own country.

02:38.987 --> 02:41.689
Well, that's the most delicate
and uncertain work there is.

02:41.691 --> 02:42.990
He wouldn't come
with me right away.

02:42.992 --> 02:44.458
Said it wouldn't fly
with his guys.

02:44.460 --> 02:45.459
It was too risky.

02:45.461 --> 02:47.161
So I set a meet for later.

02:47.163 --> 02:49.029
Plan was to bring him
straight here.

02:51.167 --> 02:52.233
Can I help you?

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074

03:01.309 --> 03:02.543
Stop or I shoot.

03:02.545 --> 03:05.179
Now I'm ready to see Saul.

03:05.181 --> 03:07.882
There's two fatalities
and a lot of blood.

03:07.884 --> 03:09.550
It's a fucking bloodbath, Saul.

03:09.552 --> 03:11.051
You got to get him out
of there as fast as possible.

03:11.053 --> 03:12.086
And get the murder weapon.

03:12.088 --> 03:13.220
What do we do about the baby?

03:13.222 --> 03:14.555
Leave it.

03:14.557 --> 03:15.723
You weren't there.

03:15.725 --> 03:17.691
<i>You don't look like a man</i>

03:17.693 --> 03:20.060
who just landed the biggest
asset of his career.

03:35.110 --> 03:36.744
So, what are we
looking for here?

03:36.746 --> 03:38.612
A .22...

03:38.614 --> 03:41.248
and the top half

03:41.250 --> 03:43.317
of this bottle.

03:46.421 --> 03:48.522
Plum wine.

03:48.524 --> 03:51.125
Yeah, some kind
of Iranian thing.

03:51.127 --> 03:53.127
I thought Muslims didn't drink.

03:58.099 --> 03:59.867
How many?

03:59.869 --> 04:00.968
What?

04:00.970 --> 04:02.403
He hit her how many times?

04:02.405 --> 04:06.140
I can see at least
a dozen separate strikes.

04:06.142 --> 04:07.875
Honestly, though, with this...

04:07.877 --> 04:09.043
who the hell knows?

04:09.045 --> 04:10.711
Cal?

04:10.713 --> 04:12.413
We're still looking for the
murder weapons here, Cort.

04:12.415 --> 04:14.048
I may have something better.

04:15.150 --> 04:17.117
Neighbor's security
camera picked it up.

04:22.424 --> 04:25.159
Money is wired from the
Al Askari Bank in Tehran

04:25.161 --> 04:27.628
the first Friday of every month

04:27.630 --> 04:30.164
to the HLBC subsidiary
in Caracas.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.002
On your signature there.

04:35.004 --> 04:37.471
We have traced the
funds downstream

04:37.473 --> 04:39.473
to a series of
terrorist actions,

04:39.475 --> 04:42.109
including the
attack on the CIA.

04:42.111 --> 04:44.979
But also to your
personal accounts

04:44.981 --> 04:47.581
where you've diverted
nearly $50 million

04:47.583 --> 04:49.550
of Revolutionary Guard money.

04:51.820 --> 04:53.587
That's punishable

04:53.589 --> 04:56.523
by death if the IRGC
were to find out.

04:58.526 --> 05:01.028
What's your point, Saul?

05:01.030 --> 05:03.330
That I've been brought down
by a girl?

05:04.599 --> 05:07.368
By two girls?

05:20.048 --> 05:22.850
Enough.

05:22.852 --> 05:25.252
I think he appreciates
the situation.

05:44.973 --> 05:46.407
He manipulates people.
That's what he does.

05:46.409 --> 05:47.808
I know.

05:47.810 --> 05:49.410
You can't let him get to you.

05:51.079 --> 05:53.147
Well, he does.

06:04.392 --> 06:07.061
Where'd you find that one?

06:07.063 --> 06:10.764
The list of outraged
Iranian exiles is long.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.535
She won't last.

06:14.537 --> 06:18.038
Well, that's what you
said about me in 1976.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.441
When we were both starting out.

06:22.277 --> 06:25.245
So you got me.

06:25.247 --> 06:27.347
Are you proud of yourself?

06:27.349 --> 06:29.917
So far.

06:29.919 --> 06:32.853
I know what you want.

06:32.855 --> 06:35.222
What's that?

06:35.224 --> 06:38.725
To clean me of what I know.

06:38.727 --> 06:41.095
I imagine the state
of our nuclear weapons program

06:41.097 --> 06:43.497
is high on your list, huh?

06:45.600 --> 06:48.235
There is a deal to be made.

06:48.237 --> 06:50.871
Or I'd be in prison by now.

06:55.477 --> 06:56.577
If I talk...

06:56.579 --> 06:58.879
if I do that,

06:58.881 --> 07:00.881
I need protection.

07:00.883 --> 07:02.916
I need a secure compound
in Miami

07:02.918 --> 07:04.952
with a guard detail.

07:04.954 --> 07:08.255
And I want my money unfrozen.

07:08.257 --> 07:10.824
All of it.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.895
Is that everything?

07:14.897 --> 07:16.897
For now.

07:16.899 --> 07:20.434
So you've put some
thought into this?

07:20.436 --> 07:22.903
Those are my terms.

07:24.439 --> 07:26.440
Okay.

07:26.442 --> 07:28.942
Okay.

07:28.944 --> 07:31.011
Those are your terms.

07:33.281 --> 07:35.949
But the problem is
you got it all wrong.

07:35.951 --> 07:39.086
'Cause what I want from you
is not just intelligence.

07:39.088 --> 07:41.088
Why do you think I went
through the trouble

07:41.090 --> 07:43.490
of documenting your
financial misdeeds?

07:43.492 --> 07:45.292
Why?

07:45.294 --> 07:47.861
You killed 219 Americans.

07:47.863 --> 07:51.865
Think I care you also ripped off
the Revolutionary Guard?

07:53.601 --> 07:55.702
I got plans for you.

07:55.704 --> 07:58.939
Much bigger than you spilling
a few state secrets.

07:58.941 --> 08:01.108
What plans?

08:01.110 --> 08:03.877
I'm gonna play you
back into Iran.

08:05.046 --> 08:08.815
From now on, you work for us.

08:08.817 --> 08:10.884
For me.

08:10.886 --> 08:13.520
I'm your new case officer.

08:18.493 --> 08:20.627
It won't work.

08:20.629 --> 08:21.828
Why's that?

08:21.830 --> 08:23.330
You burned me back home.

08:23.332 --> 08:25.365
- How?
- I'm here with you.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.000
- They don't know that.
- Oh, they will.

08:27.002 --> 08:28.669
Who's going to tell them?

08:28.671 --> 08:30.137
Not me, not you.

08:30.139 --> 08:31.572
You came here
under your own steam.

08:31.574 --> 08:32.573
However you managed that,

08:32.575 --> 08:34.241
your story's still intact.

08:34.243 --> 08:35.741
And if I refuse to go?

08:35.744 --> 08:37.311
So we're clear?

08:37.313 --> 08:40.047
I'm sending you back to Tehran
one way or the other.

08:40.049 --> 08:43.383
Either as my asset
or a traitor to the Revolution.

08:43.385 --> 08:45.686
- Was this always the plan?
- Shh.

08:45.688 --> 08:47.888
Don't think I won't, Majid.

08:47.890 --> 08:51.191
That's not a trial and quick
execution you're facing there.

08:51.193 --> 08:53.160
You'll be tortured first.

08:53.162 --> 08:56.396
And I understand public hangings
are back in vogue.

08:58.866 --> 09:01.235
I will tell you everything
you want to know,

09:01.237 --> 09:04.171
chapter and verse,
but I can't go back.

09:04.173 --> 09:05.205
You will do both.

09:05.207 --> 09:06.607
No, I won't.

09:06.609 --> 09:09.176
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't!

09:09.178 --> 09:11.011
You're bleeding.

10:03.564 --> 10:05.732
Good afternoon.

10:05.734 --> 10:06.767
Yeah.

10:06.769 --> 10:08.268
Rough night?

10:08.270 --> 10:09.770
Not especially.

10:09.772 --> 10:11.838
You look tired.

10:15.276 --> 10:17.344
Can I get you anything?

10:17.346 --> 10:20.580
You've been MIA for days now.

10:20.582 --> 10:22.282
Not really.

10:22.284 --> 10:24.785
I've been here.

10:24.787 --> 10:26.953
You've been absent.

10:26.955 --> 10:28.955
Saul, too.

10:28.957 --> 10:31.825
You care to shed
any light on that?

10:31.827 --> 10:33.927
Talk to Saul.

10:35.363 --> 10:37.998
Like I said, he's
not so easy to find.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.137
You're my guy, Peter.

10:44.139 --> 10:46.807
I recruited you.
I brought you up.

10:46.809 --> 10:48.842
- What's your point?
- My point is

10:48.844 --> 10:50.811
that entitles me to a certain
amount of forthrightness.

10:50.813 --> 10:52.546
From you.

10:53.548 --> 10:55.048
There was a double murder

10:55.050 --> 10:57.317
earlier today in Bethesda.

10:57.319 --> 10:58.785
Fariba Javadi,

10:58.787 --> 11:01.521
ex-wife of the Iranian
Deputy Security Chief.

11:01.523 --> 11:04.057
Also her daughter-in-law.

11:04.059 --> 11:07.794
I understand it was
a damn slaughter.

11:09.731 --> 11:13.433
Would you like me
to look into it for you?

11:14.402 --> 11:16.470
Fuck you.

11:18.339 --> 11:20.841
That's outside the house
where it happened.

11:20.843 --> 11:22.542
2:53 PM.

11:22.544 --> 11:23.910
You're the main suspect.

11:23.912 --> 11:26.646
I hope they nail your ass
to the wall.

11:37.892 --> 11:39.826
- Where's Saul?
- In the interrogation room.

11:39.828 --> 11:42.929
Did you know we're sending
Javadi back to Iran?

11:46.033 --> 11:47.701
You missed the fireworks.

11:47.703 --> 11:50.170
Javadi blew when he found
out he had to go back.

11:50.172 --> 11:51.538
We're on hold till
they stop the bleeding.

11:51.540 --> 11:52.773
We better not wait too long.

11:52.775 --> 11:54.541
Shit.

12:01.716 --> 12:04.251
I'm about to start again.
What's the deal?

12:04.253 --> 12:05.719
Neighbor's security camera
picked me up.

12:05.721 --> 12:07.387
There's an APB out.

12:07.389 --> 12:08.889
Just you?

12:08.891 --> 12:10.457
Yeah, somehow it missed
Javadi and Carrie.

12:10.459 --> 12:11.591
Where'd you get this?

12:11.593 --> 12:13.226
Dar Adal.
He monitors the blotters.

12:13.228 --> 12:14.561
So he knows Javadi's
in the country?

12:14.563 --> 12:16.229
He knows something's up;
he's not in on it.

12:16.231 --> 12:17.864
I suggest you go
talk to him soon.

12:17.866 --> 12:19.232
- I will.
- I mean now.

12:19.234 --> 12:20.400
He's furious.

12:20.402 --> 12:21.735
I'll smooth things over.
In the meantime,

12:21.737 --> 12:23.904
you need to stay out of sight
here in this building.

12:23.906 --> 12:25.272
We can't risk having
you arrested.

12:25.274 --> 12:26.940
Fine, but what do we do
about this?

12:26.942 --> 12:29.075
There's a police captain
in Bethesda who owes me.

12:29.077 --> 12:31.745
I could call him, at least
get the photo down off the wire.

12:31.747 --> 12:33.213
Do it, face-to-face.

12:33.215 --> 12:34.581
Play the national
security card.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.249
Tell him you have
my full support.

12:36.251 --> 12:39.052
What if he wants details
about the murder?

12:39.054 --> 12:40.821
He can't have them.

12:40.823 --> 12:43.490
If anyone even suspects Javadi's
in the country, we're through.

12:43.492 --> 12:45.625
Well?

12:45.627 --> 12:47.260
I checked the whole house
for surveillance.

12:47.262 --> 12:48.495
I must have missed
the neighbors.

12:48.497 --> 12:50.230
Yeah, well, I missed
the whole fucking thing.

12:50.232 --> 12:51.998
How's it going in there?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.067
Slowly.

13:00.775 --> 13:02.776
Trouble?

13:02.778 --> 13:04.511
Oh, we'll manage.

13:04.513 --> 13:06.947
You seem upset.

13:06.949 --> 13:08.915
That's good enough.

13:20.963 --> 13:22.996
Well?

13:22.998 --> 13:24.664
Well what?

13:24.666 --> 13:28.435
Have you come to terms
with your situation?

13:29.437 --> 13:31.204
How does it work?

13:31.206 --> 13:33.139
We return you to your people

13:33.141 --> 13:34.307
as soon as possible.

13:34.309 --> 13:35.642
I assume they've arranged a way

13:35.644 --> 13:37.310
for you to get out
of the country.

13:37.312 --> 13:39.479
No, I meant about Fariba.

13:39.481 --> 13:43.216
A crime is committed
that must be covered up.

13:44.318 --> 13:46.052
How does it work here?

13:48.189 --> 13:50.490
You killed her.

13:50.492 --> 13:52.459
Why?

13:52.461 --> 13:56.096
Get back at me
because you could?

13:58.132 --> 14:00.200
She was my wife.

14:00.202 --> 14:02.002
She was unfaithful.

14:02.004 --> 14:03.703
She was your ex-wife.

14:03.705 --> 14:05.305
It was 35 years ago.

14:05.307 --> 14:08.375
In the eyes of God,
we're still married.

14:10.011 --> 14:12.345
I should have stoned her
to death,

14:12.347 --> 14:15.882
but you didn't give me
enough time.

14:23.925 --> 14:25.759
Remember this?

14:25.761 --> 14:28.261
It was Fariba's 21st birthday.

14:29.530 --> 14:33.366
We talked all night,
the four of us,

14:33.368 --> 14:35.835
about what the
future might bring.

14:39.674 --> 14:41.741
It wasn't this.

15:33.561 --> 15:34.894
Carrie?

15:34.896 --> 15:36.329
I thought
we were meeting outside.

15:36.331 --> 15:39.065
My guys have a few questions.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.668
You told them I can't talk
about it, right?

15:41.670 --> 15:43.236
Yeah, I told them.

15:43.238 --> 15:45.939
Detectives Johnson,

15:45.941 --> 15:48.341
Cort, Carrie Mathison.

15:50.277 --> 15:53.413
Okay, I understand
you're not happy about this.

15:53.415 --> 15:55.115
Oh, and you are?

15:55.117 --> 15:56.583
Of course not.

15:56.585 --> 15:58.184
We're as upset as you.

15:59.788 --> 16:01.421
So who's this guy?

16:01.423 --> 16:02.656
I'm afraid that's classified.

16:02.658 --> 16:03.957
But he's one of yours?

16:03.959 --> 16:05.525
Well, that's classified, too.

16:07.261 --> 16:09.629
Can you tell me
what he was doing here?

16:09.631 --> 16:11.531
That's...

16:11.533 --> 16:13.933
Can you tell me how
he knew the victims?

16:13.935 --> 16:15.602
- Okay, wait a second.
- Can you tell me

16:15.604 --> 16:16.803
any goddamn thing at all?

16:16.805 --> 16:18.138
Can you tell me why this
lady's laying here

16:18.140 --> 16:19.606
with her throat cut to ribbons?

16:19.608 --> 16:22.509
Any fucking thing?

16:28.349 --> 16:29.783
Excuse me.

16:30.818 --> 16:31.818
Okay, Cap?

16:47.802 --> 16:49.169
You're not a fanatic.

16:49.171 --> 16:50.804
You're a pragmatist.

16:50.806 --> 16:52.505
Always have been.

16:52.507 --> 16:56.076
Don't tell me what I am
and what I am not.

16:56.078 --> 16:58.011
Well, we're both old men.

16:58.013 --> 17:00.080
There's no disputing that.

17:01.882 --> 17:04.517
We are.

17:04.519 --> 17:06.386
It's the curse of
old men to realize

17:06.387 --> 17:08.755
that in the end,
we control nothing.

17:12.093 --> 17:14.928
So we lash out.

17:16.864 --> 17:18.498
Buenos Aires,

17:18.500 --> 17:20.333
Berlin...

17:22.103 --> 17:24.537
Bergen.

17:24.539 --> 17:26.839
These are small acts, Majid.

17:28.041 --> 17:30.710
Unworthy of you.

17:30.712 --> 17:32.812
You left something out.

17:34.215 --> 17:36.549
The bombing of the CIA.

17:36.551 --> 17:39.352
Nothing small about that.

17:39.354 --> 17:41.387
Nothing unworthy.

17:41.389 --> 17:44.057
Well, I wanted to talk
about that, too.

17:44.059 --> 17:45.892
I'm sure you do.

17:45.894 --> 17:48.394
Because when that
bomb went off,

17:48.396 --> 17:50.764
killing all those people,

17:50.766 --> 17:54.400
many of them my friends,

17:54.402 --> 17:56.402
my first thought

17:56.404 --> 17:58.805
was not revenge.

17:58.807 --> 18:01.441
It was...

18:01.443 --> 18:04.544
"Something has to change."

18:04.546 --> 18:07.247
You hit us, we hit you.

18:07.249 --> 18:10.216
It's always the same.

18:10.218 --> 18:12.752
And...

18:12.754 --> 18:15.421
how does my going back
as your spy

18:15.423 --> 18:17.190
change any of that?

18:18.592 --> 18:21.961
For years, we toiled
in back rooms, you and I.

18:21.963 --> 18:23.930
We toiled

18:23.932 --> 18:27.901
while shallower men
held the stage,

18:27.903 --> 18:30.603
waiting for our time to come,

18:30.605 --> 18:34.174
gradually understanding
it never would.

18:34.176 --> 18:37.243
Now it has, unexpectedly.

18:37.245 --> 18:39.312
For you, it has.

18:42.783 --> 18:45.485
You're the one
who made it possible.

18:46.921 --> 18:48.288
I want to return the favor.

18:49.791 --> 18:52.192
Does this look like
a favor to you, Saul?

18:52.194 --> 18:55.295
Majid, thanks to you,

18:55.297 --> 18:57.630
I stand at the center of things.

18:57.632 --> 18:59.766
You put me in power.

18:59.768 --> 19:02.302
You go back to Tehran,
I'll do the same for you.

19:02.304 --> 19:04.604
Ah.

19:04.606 --> 19:07.774
I know a way.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.281
You all right?

19:15.283 --> 19:18.151
Yeah, sorry. I don't know
what happened there.

19:18.153 --> 19:19.719
So are we okay?

19:19.721 --> 19:21.888
I wouldn't say so, no.

19:21.890 --> 19:24.157
I'm sorry, but can't
you handle that?

19:24.159 --> 19:27.227
You mean, can't I just pull rank
and shut this thing down?

19:27.229 --> 19:29.996
Sure, just like you try with me.

19:29.998 --> 19:31.664
But you know what happens next?

19:31.666 --> 19:33.299
Somehow that photo

19:33.301 --> 19:34.801
and all the evidence
in this room

19:34.803 --> 19:36.002
show up on Drudge Report

19:36.004 --> 19:37.370
or goddamn Wikileaks,

19:37.372 --> 19:39.672
and then you've got yourself
a real problem.

19:39.674 --> 19:41.741
And don't look at me

19:41.743 --> 19:43.877
like I'm being less
than helpful.

19:43.879 --> 19:46.579
I'm just talking reality here.

19:46.581 --> 19:49.148
So what do you suggest?

19:49.150 --> 19:51.584
They want to talk to the guy
in the photo.

19:51.586 --> 19:53.820
- That's impossible.
- You want this thing

19:53.822 --> 19:55.555
closed quietly?

19:55.557 --> 19:57.991
Find a way.

20:05.433 --> 20:07.233
Where's Quinn?

20:07.235 --> 20:08.401
Uh, outside, I think.

20:08.403 --> 20:09.736
Could you find him?

20:09.738 --> 20:12.438
Was it always the plan to
send Javadi back to Iran?

20:12.440 --> 20:13.706
It was always the hope.

20:13.708 --> 20:14.941
No one told me.

20:14.943 --> 20:16.542
Well, you should be proud.

20:16.544 --> 20:17.911
Your work made it all possible.

20:17.913 --> 20:18.945
I'm not proud.

20:18.947 --> 20:20.380
What he did to this country,

20:20.382 --> 20:22.382
it's nothing compared
to what he did to Iran.

20:22.384 --> 20:25.218
- We should try him for what he's done.
- That's not the plan.

20:25.220 --> 20:26.586
That's not the plan.

20:26.588 --> 20:28.154
Go find Quinn, please.

20:34.361 --> 20:35.895
- He's in.
- Good.

20:35.897 --> 20:37.196
How'd you make out?

20:37.198 --> 20:38.598
Not so well.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.568
They want to talk to you--
the local cops do.

20:42.570 --> 20:44.804
- You told them that was impossible, right?
- Several times.

20:44.806 --> 20:46.406
I thought your captain friend
was gonna take care of this.

20:46.408 --> 20:48.374
Yeah, me, too. He boned me.

20:48.376 --> 20:50.643
The important thing here is to
not jeopardize the Javadi play.

20:50.645 --> 20:52.612
Agreed? So let me talk
to them, the cops.

20:52.614 --> 20:53.780
And say what?

20:53.782 --> 20:55.248
I don't know, see what they ask.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.449
You know what they'll ask.

20:56.451 --> 20:57.817
You're their only suspect,

20:57.819 --> 20:59.652
and since you can't tell them
what actually happened,

20:59.654 --> 21:00.920
you'll be admitting
to two murders

21:00.922 --> 21:02.655
and then saying
they can't touch you for it.

21:02.657 --> 21:04.057
Okay.

21:04.059 --> 21:06.059
Look, we have police threatening
to blow up our operation.

21:06.061 --> 21:07.827
At the very least,
this buys us enough time

21:07.829 --> 21:09.262
to get Javadi
out of the country.

21:09.264 --> 21:10.730
So unless you got
another option?

21:10.732 --> 21:12.565
Do it.

21:12.567 --> 21:13.766
At least let me go with him.

21:13.768 --> 21:15.101
No. Javadi came here
to contact you.

21:15.103 --> 21:16.936
You're the only one who
can be seen with him.

21:16.938 --> 21:19.339
I need you to get him
back to his people.

21:19.341 --> 21:20.673
- When?
- Soon as possible.

21:20.675 --> 21:22.241
You got to get him
out of the country

21:22.243 --> 21:23.309
before anything else blows up,

21:23.311 --> 21:25.078
and you need to stay right
by his side.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.612
We cannot risk
another screwup, okay?

21:26.614 --> 21:28.281
- Where will you be?
- I got a meeting

21:28.283 --> 21:29.615
with Senator Lockhart,
who's apparently noticed

21:29.617 --> 21:31.451
I haven't been at my office
all week.

21:32.787 --> 21:35.288
We need to keep
this thing together

21:35.290 --> 21:38.157
until Javadi's on a plane
heading back to Iran.

21:43.197 --> 21:44.630
It's time.

21:44.632 --> 21:46.299
Carrie will take you back.

21:46.301 --> 21:49.268
And what makes you sure
I won't just vanish?

21:49.270 --> 21:50.970
This way.

21:50.972 --> 21:53.840
She'll be with you all
the way to the plane.

21:53.842 --> 21:56.442
I meant in Iran.

21:56.444 --> 21:58.878
What I said before.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.480
You started this.

22:00.482 --> 22:03.716
I think you'll want
to be there when it ends.

22:14.995 --> 22:18.331
I need to know something
before you leave.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.833
I need to know.

22:20.835 --> 22:23.403
Who was responsible
for the bomb?

22:23.405 --> 22:25.004
The bomb at Langley?

22:25.006 --> 22:26.005
Yes.

22:26.007 --> 22:27.707
On the ground that day.

22:27.709 --> 22:29.575
Who was responsible?

22:32.012 --> 22:34.213
I thought it was Brody.

22:34.215 --> 22:36.249
That's what you
told the Senate.

22:36.251 --> 22:39.419
That's what you told
the entire world.

22:39.421 --> 22:40.987
You have a manhunt
on five continents,

22:40.989 --> 22:42.555
a $10 million reward...

22:42.557 --> 22:44.023
Did he do it?
Yes or no.

22:44.025 --> 22:46.692
I don't know.

22:46.694 --> 22:47.894
I don't believe you.

22:47.896 --> 22:50.630
- I don't...
- Look me in the eye and answer.

22:58.605 --> 23:01.274
It wasn't him.

23:01.276 --> 23:04.210
It was one of Abu Nazir's guys.

23:04.212 --> 23:06.179
Who, exactly...

23:06.181 --> 23:09.082
I didn't want to know.

23:17.858 --> 23:20.226
We'll get you some
clothes to change into.

23:20.228 --> 23:22.628
Then Carrie will take you
back to your plane.

23:51.558 --> 23:52.792
Will you give me a sec?

23:52.794 --> 23:53.860
Yes, sir.

24:14.982 --> 24:16.449
Saul?

24:16.451 --> 24:18.151
Where are you?

24:18.153 --> 24:19.519
Driving.

24:19.521 --> 24:21.454
Home?

24:21.456 --> 24:22.455
No.

24:22.457 --> 24:24.457
Back to work.

24:24.459 --> 24:26.893
I've been thinking
about our days in Tehran.

24:29.496 --> 24:31.097
Really?

24:31.099 --> 24:32.632
That was...

24:32.634 --> 24:34.300
a long time ago.

24:34.302 --> 24:35.301
Yep.

24:35.303 --> 24:37.370
We were so young.

24:39.673 --> 24:42.708
I was so worried about you
when it all went to hell.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.777
About getting you out.

24:47.681 --> 24:52.451
Yeah, no, I was...
worried about you.

24:52.453 --> 24:54.520
Leaving you behind.

25:01.828 --> 25:03.896
I said I didn't care about
your friend from Mumbai,

25:03.898 --> 25:05.531
but I do.

25:09.503 --> 25:11.671
I said I didn't have
any claim on you.

25:11.673 --> 25:13.206
Saul...

25:13.208 --> 25:14.674
But I do.

25:14.676 --> 25:16.842
Maybe it's just in my own mind
at this point.

25:16.844 --> 25:17.977
I don't know.

25:19.513 --> 25:22.114
But I needed to tell you
before it's too late.

25:24.851 --> 25:26.252
Did you hear me?

25:26.254 --> 25:27.587
Yes.

25:27.589 --> 25:29.422
It's the first time
I could come up for air

25:29.424 --> 25:30.523
in nearly two days.

25:30.525 --> 25:31.791
I wanted you to know.

25:34.361 --> 25:36.195
When are you coming home?

25:36.197 --> 25:38.764
Usual.

25:38.766 --> 25:41.200
Not till late.

25:41.202 --> 25:42.568
Okay.

25:42.570 --> 25:44.637
Well, I'll see you then.

26:18.740 --> 26:20.806
Just follow the tags, and...

26:23.577 --> 26:25.645
In there.

27:21.935 --> 27:22.935
What's this?

27:22.937 --> 27:24.136
How we'll contact you.

27:24.138 --> 27:25.137
Memorize it.

27:25.139 --> 27:26.706
Also your cover story.

27:26.708 --> 27:28.140
The information
you pried out of me

27:28.142 --> 27:29.308
that justifies
your coming here.

27:29.310 --> 27:30.710
It's how we took down
your network.

27:30.712 --> 27:31.711
Is it true?

27:31.713 --> 27:33.212
It's verifiable.

27:33.214 --> 27:34.847
Who is the source?

27:36.049 --> 27:37.450
If I go to Iran,

27:37.452 --> 27:39.118
I'll have to take
the traitor out.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.486
You know that.

27:40.488 --> 27:42.321
The source is a hack we did,

27:42.323 --> 27:43.989
a computer virus
that allowed us

27:43.991 --> 27:45.624
to monitor your communications.

27:45.626 --> 27:47.326
You want to take
it out, go ahead.

27:47.328 --> 27:48.661
We have you now.

27:48.663 --> 27:50.329
It's time to go
back to your people.

27:50.331 --> 27:51.597
You ready?

27:54.469 --> 27:56.268
Yeah.

28:10.318 --> 28:12.585
What were you planning to do,

28:12.587 --> 28:14.653
bypass me entirely?

28:17.758 --> 28:19.525
I'm not going to apologize.

28:19.527 --> 28:21.026
I had to keep the circle small.

28:21.028 --> 28:22.328
Not that small.

28:22.330 --> 28:23.929
You, Carrie, Quinn.

28:23.931 --> 28:25.865
And come to think
of it, I haven't seen

28:25.867 --> 28:27.199
that headscarf for a while.

28:27.201 --> 28:28.901
All need-to-know.

28:28.903 --> 28:30.970
I thought we
trusted each other.

28:43.016 --> 28:45.084
Just you.

28:46.219 --> 28:47.386
I tell just you.

28:47.388 --> 28:48.888
I don't see how.

28:48.890 --> 28:51.791
You've got Lockhart
waiting in your office.

28:51.793 --> 28:53.359
You think he didn't notice

28:53.361 --> 28:55.528
that the ex-wife of
the IRGC Chief

28:55.530 --> 28:57.229
got slaughtered in Bethesda?

28:57.231 --> 28:58.898
Or that Carrie,

28:58.900 --> 29:00.566
whom you committed
to a psych ward,

29:00.568 --> 29:03.702
got out and you're
doing shit about it?

29:03.704 --> 29:06.372
He's the head of the Senate
Intelligence Committee,

29:06.374 --> 29:08.441
not some civilian
fuck-monkey.

29:09.743 --> 29:10.776
Okay.

29:10.778 --> 29:12.912
I do have something going.

29:12.914 --> 29:13.979
An operation...

29:13.981 --> 29:15.080
And we're past that.

29:15.082 --> 29:16.282
It's time for details.

29:16.284 --> 29:17.817
Fine.

29:17.819 --> 29:19.885
I'll tell you both.

29:27.127 --> 29:29.829
You never told me
whose idea it was.

29:31.598 --> 29:33.766
To hang you out as bait.

29:33.768 --> 29:35.835
Was it your idea or Saul's?

29:39.474 --> 29:40.806
That's all right.

29:40.808 --> 29:43.776
You don't have to say.

29:43.778 --> 29:45.010
It was Saul's idea.

29:45.946 --> 29:47.913
It had to be.

29:47.915 --> 29:49.982
In fact, it's classic Saul.

29:51.918 --> 29:54.253
If it's so classic,
why'd you fall for it?

29:54.255 --> 29:56.422
Why do you think?

29:56.424 --> 29:59.124
It was you.

29:59.126 --> 30:01.527
The abuse you went through.

30:01.529 --> 30:04.096
What Saul did to you
to get me here.

30:04.098 --> 30:06.866
Even I have never done
anything so cruel.

30:11.171 --> 30:13.806
You're forgetting
I've seen your handiwork.

30:13.808 --> 30:15.841
You can't bullshit me.

30:15.843 --> 30:17.142
I'm not bullshitting you.

30:17.144 --> 30:19.879
Then you're seriously deluded.

30:20.947 --> 30:22.147
You know what he asked me?

30:22.149 --> 30:23.716
Why you killed your wife?

30:23.718 --> 30:26.318
Who moved the bomb.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.187
If it was Brody.

30:28.189 --> 30:30.022
Now, why would he ask me that?

30:30.991 --> 30:32.391
That implies that there's

30:32.393 --> 30:34.360
a difference of opinion
on that subject.

30:34.362 --> 30:36.729
Right?

30:41.501 --> 30:43.802
What'd you tell him?

30:43.804 --> 30:46.305
That it was one of
Abu Nazir's guys.

30:49.709 --> 30:51.443
Not Brody?

30:52.512 --> 30:54.280
No.

30:58.351 --> 31:00.419
Who?

31:00.421 --> 31:02.488
Someone else.

31:04.524 --> 31:06.592
That's all I know.

31:16.536 --> 31:18.604
You Peter Quinn?

31:21.207 --> 31:23.676
Uh, yeah.

31:23.678 --> 31:25.778
What?
That's a difficult question?

31:25.780 --> 31:26.779
No.

31:26.781 --> 31:28.347
'Cause your compadre Mathison,

31:28.349 --> 31:30.449
she promised
what she called "Candor."

31:32.886 --> 31:35.154
Peter Quinn is, uh...

31:36.222 --> 31:37.890
What?

31:37.892 --> 31:39.959
My legal name.

31:46.566 --> 31:49.401
Uh, one of the victims,
she was Iranian.

31:49.403 --> 31:50.703
Yes.

31:50.705 --> 31:54.740
Ex-wife of an Iranian
security guy... IRGC?

31:54.742 --> 31:56.241
Yes.

31:56.243 --> 31:57.710
And the other victim,
that's his daughter-in-law?

31:57.712 --> 31:58.711
Yes.

31:58.713 --> 32:01.146
I assume that's significant.

32:01.148 --> 32:02.748
Right.

32:02.750 --> 32:05.417
These are some terse responses.

32:05.419 --> 32:08.087
Look, can we just
get on with this?

32:08.089 --> 32:09.088
"On with this"?

32:09.090 --> 32:10.222
We are "On with it."

32:10.224 --> 32:11.924
How are we not "On with it"?

32:11.926 --> 32:13.258
My colleague led me to believe

32:13.260 --> 32:14.393
you were after a confession.

32:14.395 --> 32:15.494
Well, that's incorrect.

32:15.496 --> 32:16.729
What I said was,

32:16.731 --> 32:18.263
I'm trying to understand
what happened here.

32:18.265 --> 32:19.398
That's not gonna be possible.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.399
Yeah, that's what she said.

32:20.401 --> 32:21.900
She said all I need to know

32:21.902 --> 32:23.135
is that it's national security.

32:23.137 --> 32:26.472
This is. This.

32:29.843 --> 32:32.011
Look, I know you think
I'm just some dick

32:32.013 --> 32:33.579
jacking you up because I can,

32:33.581 --> 32:34.747
'cause you were unlucky enough

32:34.749 --> 32:36.115
to get yourself photographed.

32:36.117 --> 32:38.250
And maybe that's
true, I don't know.

32:38.252 --> 32:39.585
But actually,

32:39.587 --> 32:43.255
I'm just trying to understand

32:43.257 --> 32:45.357
this shit that you people do.

32:45.359 --> 32:47.626
This shit that we're a party to

32:47.628 --> 32:49.762
'cause we pay taxes.

32:49.764 --> 32:52.131
This...

32:52.133 --> 32:54.199
This shit.

33:06.312 --> 33:08.247
So you killed the daughter?

33:16.356 --> 33:17.356
Yes.

33:17.358 --> 33:18.891
With?

33:18.893 --> 33:20.492
A Walther P22.

33:20.494 --> 33:22.728
What about the mother?
Same weapon?

33:24.130 --> 33:26.198
No.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.067
That was with a bottle.

33:29.002 --> 33:31.070
Plum wine.

33:33.973 --> 33:36.475
For national security.

33:38.912 --> 33:40.979
You fucking people.

33:43.850 --> 33:46.318
Have you ever done anything...

33:46.320 --> 33:48.420
but make things worse?

33:54.694 --> 33:57.596
This is special
access information.

33:57.598 --> 33:59.031
Fine.

33:59.033 --> 34:01.366
It can't leave this room.

34:01.368 --> 34:03.302
Understood.

34:08.908 --> 34:10.342
So?

34:10.344 --> 34:13.712
I've recruited
a high-level Iranian asset.

34:13.714 --> 34:18.884
IRGC Deputy Chief Majid Javadi.

34:18.886 --> 34:21.219
Javadi?

34:21.222 --> 34:22.721
Yes.

34:22.723 --> 34:25.257
The man who financed the bombing
of the CIA.

34:25.259 --> 34:26.725
That's right.

34:26.726 --> 34:29.795
Why on Earth
would you trust him?

34:29.797 --> 34:31.396
We've developed information
that would compromise him

34:31.398 --> 34:32.898
with his own government;

34:32.900 --> 34:35.033
evidence of wholesale
corruption.

34:35.034 --> 34:37.402
Which, in Iran,
just means it's Tuesday.

34:37.404 --> 34:39.737
Normally I'd agree.

34:39.739 --> 34:43.909
But this is tens of millions
of dollars siphoned

34:43.911 --> 34:46.578
from a secret IRGC fund

34:46.580 --> 34:48.781
designated
for terrorist activities.

34:48.783 --> 34:51.083
No one would look the other way.

34:51.085 --> 34:52.451
So you blackmailed him.

34:52.453 --> 34:54.753
That's right.

34:54.755 --> 34:57.422
Is there some reason
you didn't tell my Committee?

34:57.424 --> 34:59.591
I was waiting for it to be real.

34:59.593 --> 35:01.426
It wasn't because
this is just the kind

35:01.428 --> 35:03.328
of human intelligence nonsense

35:03.330 --> 35:04.496
that led to disaster

35:04.498 --> 35:08.400
right here in this building
not four months ago?

35:08.402 --> 35:12.137
Believing our sworn enemies
will magically switch sides.

35:14.674 --> 35:16.742
We talked about this,

35:16.744 --> 35:20.846
the need to wean you
of your cold war bullshit.

35:20.848 --> 35:22.748
We agreed to disagree.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.283
I don't see it that way,

35:24.285 --> 35:27.753
not when I'm inheriting
your mess in ten days.

35:27.755 --> 35:30.155
A mess.

35:32.091 --> 35:34.293
That's what you call placing

35:34.295 --> 35:35.761
a major asset
inside a government

35:35.763 --> 35:39.698
that's been a black
box for 30 years?

35:41.134 --> 35:43.101
You asked me what
I've been doing.

35:43.103 --> 35:45.204
I told you.

35:46.372 --> 35:48.140
Are we done?

35:48.142 --> 35:51.043
Not by a long shot.

35:51.045 --> 35:54.179
I want to know
how this happened.

35:59.152 --> 36:00.953
Almost there.

36:03.857 --> 36:06.592
Almost there and you still
haven't asked.

36:08.795 --> 36:10.329
What?

36:10.331 --> 36:13.265
Who moved the bomb.

36:15.335 --> 36:18.303
You told Saul it was one
of Abu Nazir's guys.

36:18.305 --> 36:20.339
Yes, I did.

36:20.341 --> 36:22.174
Which I already knew.

36:22.176 --> 36:25.310
And who handed him the keys?

36:28.481 --> 36:30.849
Don't tell me
you never wondered.

36:30.851 --> 36:34.419
I bet you wonder all the time.

36:34.421 --> 36:37.689
Brody escaped the blast.

36:37.691 --> 36:40.225
Did he know it was coming?

36:41.261 --> 36:43.629
Maybe I already know
the answer to that.

36:45.265 --> 36:46.965
Maybe you don't.

36:53.339 --> 36:57.175
Fine. I guess you
don't want the truth.

37:00.346 --> 37:03.548
I do. I just don't think
I'd get it from you.

37:03.550 --> 37:05.117
Okay.

37:12.191 --> 37:13.959
I want to know about the wife.

37:13.961 --> 37:14.960
What about her?

37:14.962 --> 37:16.461
You recruit Javadi,

37:16.463 --> 37:18.630
his wife's suddenly dead
along with the daughter-in-law.

37:18.632 --> 37:20.065
Don't tell me
that's a coincidence.

37:20.067 --> 37:21.600
It's not.

37:21.602 --> 37:22.935
So who did it?

37:27.141 --> 37:29.408
You know, every time
you answer a question

37:29.410 --> 37:31.143
with a big, gaping nothing,

37:31.145 --> 37:34.146
it reminds me what a problem
we have, you and I.

37:34.148 --> 37:36.281
It was Javadi.

37:39.719 --> 37:40.752
Wait a second.

37:40.754 --> 37:43.388
You're saying he was
in this country?

37:43.390 --> 37:44.756
That's right.

37:44.758 --> 37:46.758
And you knew this?

37:46.760 --> 37:49.628
We lured him here.

37:49.630 --> 37:51.463
Carrie did.

37:57.904 --> 37:59.805
So, wait.

37:59.807 --> 38:02.941
You two...

38:02.943 --> 38:05.077
You were working together.

38:05.079 --> 38:07.446
Even when
you were denouncing her

38:07.448 --> 38:09.181
in front of my Committee.

38:09.183 --> 38:10.515
All for show.

38:12.618 --> 38:15.020
Did you know?

38:15.022 --> 38:16.321
I'm learning it now with you.

38:16.323 --> 38:17.622
Well, who did know?

38:17.624 --> 38:19.791
Everyone who needed to.

38:19.793 --> 38:21.360
No, everyone who needed to
didn't know,

38:21.362 --> 38:24.096
because two of those people
are in this room right now

38:24.098 --> 38:25.263
holding their dicks.

38:25.265 --> 38:27.466
I want Carrie brought in... now.

38:27.468 --> 38:28.767
She can't come here now.

38:28.769 --> 38:30.135
And why is that?

38:30.137 --> 38:32.604
She's busy. She's putting Javadi
on a plane back to Iran.

38:32.606 --> 38:34.272
He's still here?

38:35.641 --> 38:37.042
Ground the fucking plane.

38:37.044 --> 38:38.343
- No.
- Ground it.

38:39.479 --> 38:41.380
I'm Acting Director
for another two weeks.

38:41.382 --> 38:43.048
It's not your call.

38:43.050 --> 38:45.650
I'll bump this up to the
President, I swear to God.

38:45.652 --> 38:46.985
Then what?

38:46.987 --> 38:50.022
We fry Javadi's ass publicly.

38:50.024 --> 38:51.556
Well, that's shortsighted.

38:51.558 --> 38:53.291
It's justice.

38:53.293 --> 38:55.160
It's ineffective...
'cause back in Tehran,

38:55.162 --> 38:57.062
he's replaced by someone
just like him

38:57.064 --> 38:58.630
who we can't control.

38:58.632 --> 39:00.065
And the attack
that happened here

39:00.067 --> 39:01.900
happens again
and again and again.

39:01.902 --> 39:04.369
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
operation

39:04.371 --> 39:06.371
that can transform everything.

39:06.373 --> 39:08.340
The entire Middle East.

39:08.342 --> 39:10.842
You sound like
you're fucking high.

39:10.844 --> 39:13.612
I'm calling the President.

39:15.348 --> 39:17.249
Did you hear what I said?

39:17.251 --> 39:20.452
I'm calling him.
Get me a goddamn phone.

39:23.022 --> 39:24.389
Fine.

39:28.661 --> 39:30.028
Here.

39:30.030 --> 39:31.863
Destroy everything
we've been working for.

39:31.865 --> 39:34.433
I'm not even going to dignify
that with a response.

39:34.435 --> 39:36.835
- You really don't get it, do you?
- You know what?

39:36.837 --> 39:38.904
For the first time,
I think I really do.

39:38.906 --> 39:41.706
I see now why this place
has been a fucking clown act

39:41.708 --> 39:43.708
for decades.
How does this work?

39:43.710 --> 39:45.744
I'm not sure.

39:45.746 --> 39:48.246
And don't worry.
I'll handle the President.

39:53.419 --> 39:55.153
Open the door.

39:56.089 --> 39:57.122
No.

39:57.124 --> 39:59.124
Open the goddamned door.

39:59.126 --> 40:00.525
Make me.

40:00.527 --> 40:03.562
Dar, let me out of here.

40:03.564 --> 40:06.031
Dar?

40:06.033 --> 40:08.900
Dar.

40:08.902 --> 40:10.068
You're dead.

40:10.070 --> 40:11.303
Both of you son...

40:19.612 --> 40:21.346
What the fuck?

40:37.663 --> 40:40.198
Well, you had your chance.

41:02.455 --> 41:03.955
Wait!

41:03.957 --> 41:06.291
It's okay.

41:06.293 --> 41:07.592
It's okay.

41:18.938 --> 41:21.473
You said you'd tell me
the truth.

41:21.475 --> 41:23.441
And you told me
I was incapable.

41:23.443 --> 41:26.278
You might be right.

41:26.280 --> 41:31.149
But if you want to talk
to someone you can trust...

41:31.151 --> 41:33.785
who was there,
you should know that the man

41:33.787 --> 41:36.721
who built the bomb
and moved the SUV...

41:36.723 --> 41:39.691
he didn't die in the
explosion like they say.

41:41.294 --> 41:43.828
As far as I know, he's
still in this country.

41:43.830 --> 41:44.829
Where?

41:44.831 --> 41:45.830
I don't know.

41:45.832 --> 41:46.831
Who does?

41:46.833 --> 41:49.668
Someone you've already met.

41:49.670 --> 41:52.404
The man that brought
us together.

41:54.173 --> 41:57.008
Your lawyer? Bennett?

41:57.010 --> 42:00.512
No. The way this
worked out, believe me,

42:00.514 --> 42:03.048
he's not my lawyer anymore.

42:28.207 --> 42:31.209
You requested
radar following on Three Six Oscar?

42:31.211 --> 42:32.911
Yes.

42:32.913 --> 42:36.781
That aircraft cleared
US airspace at 2219 hours.

42:36.783 --> 42:38.083
Thank you.

42:38.085 --> 42:38.917
Yes, sir.

42:42.421 --> 42:44.689
An audacious operation.

42:44.691 --> 42:46.524
Just the beginning.

42:47.694 --> 42:50.695
Here's to continued success.

42:53.432 --> 42:56.401
You know, I do need
to apologize...

42:56.403 --> 42:58.403
for excluding you.

42:58.405 --> 43:01.206
You don't have
to explain yourself, Saul.

43:01.208 --> 43:03.575
You are the goddamn
Acting Director

43:03.577 --> 43:05.910
of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

43:05.912 --> 43:08.079
For ten more days.

43:20.926 --> 43:22.260
Senator Lockhart managed

43:22.262 --> 43:24.229
to get himself stuck
in the conference room.

43:24.231 --> 43:27.532
Could you ask facilities
to let him out?

43:54.794 --> 43:56.294
How'd it go?

43:56.296 --> 43:58.263
They're standing down.

43:58.265 --> 43:59.464
So it went well.

43:59.466 --> 44:03.501
What do they say,
confession is good for the soul?

44:04.603 --> 44:06.604
Only you didn't do it.

44:06.606 --> 44:08.373
I know.

44:08.375 --> 44:11.609
But it made me feel better.

44:11.611 --> 44:14.612
Wrong crime, right guy, I guess.

44:14.614 --> 44:16.981
You know what else I realized?

44:16.983 --> 44:19.384
Just how through I am with...

44:21.721 --> 44:24.923
this, the CIA.

44:27.727 --> 44:30.895
I just do not believe anymore.

44:32.031 --> 44:34.132
Believe what?

44:34.134 --> 44:39.003
That anything justifies
the damage we do.

44:41.508 --> 44:43.508
You can't quit yet.

44:43.510 --> 44:46.077
Javadi's out over the
Atlantic heading home.

44:46.079 --> 44:48.413
And he told me something
before he left...

44:48.415 --> 44:49.848
about the Langley bomber.

44:49.850 --> 44:51.015
You mean Brody.

44:51.017 --> 44:52.517
No, that's just it.

44:52.519 --> 44:55.019
It's not him,
and I can prove it now.

44:55.021 --> 44:57.489
But...

44:57.491 --> 44:59.991
I need your help.

45:03.996 --> 45:05.730
Quinn?

45:11.504 --> 45:13.238
Sure, Carrie.

45:13.240 --> 45:14.773
Whatever you need.

45:56.715 --> 45:58.883
Saul...

46:02.321 --> 46:04.122
How-how was your day?

46:04.124 --> 46:05.723
Had a good day.

46:06.725 --> 46:09.727
Actually a really good day.

46:28.113 --> 46:30.181
Forgive me.

46:33.452 --> 46:35.520
For what?

46:39.326 --> 46:42.660
I'd forgotten...

46:42.662 --> 46:45.230
how beautiful you are.

<i>You had Majid Javadi
and let him go.</i>

47:21.817 --> 47:22.463
I did.

47:22.578 --> 47:23.919
Jesus Christ, Saul.

47:24.098 --> 47:25.416
ON THE NEXT HOMELAND

47:25.513 --> 47:28.070
They're connecting your firm to the
guy who detonated the bomb at Langley.

47:28.183 --> 47:29.547
You may have been compromised.

47:29.706 --> 47:31.431
Cooperate with us
or come play it.

47:31.557 --> 47:32.938
Come after me if you want.

47:33.191 --> 47:34.290
<i>I've got nothing to hide.</i>

47:34.421 --> 47:35.538
<i>How much do I tell him?</i>

47:35.649 --> 47:36.563
I don't care.

47:36.900 --> 47:38.209
<i>Just... get him out.</i>

47:38.424 --> 47:40.347
The bomber is the only way
to prove that Brody's innocent.

47:40.419 --> 47:41.719
<i>Saul promised me
this guy alive.</i>

47:41.799 --> 47:43.159
Saul's not calling the shots here!

47:43.286 --> 47:44.119
<i>Turn around,</i>

47:44.228 --> 47:45.267
or we will stop you.

47:45.366 --> 47:46.264
It's all right. I can't.

47:46.374 --> 47:47.570
<i>Carrie, this is Quinn.</i>

47:47.670 --> 47:49.214
<i>I will pay the shot.</i>
