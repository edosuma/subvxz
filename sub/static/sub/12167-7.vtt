00:07.211 --> 00:10.756
Reliable power generation
is one of our greatest concerns.

00:10.923 --> 00:13.801
With this project
we hope soon to convert and utilise

00:13.968 --> 00:16.887
the intense heat
trapped beneath our planet's surface.

00:17.054 --> 00:21.100
Geothermal energy. What, using this?

00:21.267 --> 00:23.644
Do you have any idea how complex...

00:23.811 --> 00:27.523
- McKay.
- I'm sure it'll work like a charm.

00:28.399 --> 00:31.193
Looks like you're accomplishing
great things here.

00:31.360 --> 00:35.448
Since the last Wraith culling
we have diligently rebuilt our society.

00:35.614 --> 00:38.617
Are you not concerned
you will attract their attention?

00:38.784 --> 00:43.414
Yes, but we refuse to let that stop us
from striving to reach our potential.

00:43.581 --> 00:46.125
To do otherwise
would mean victory for them.

00:46.292 --> 00:50.046
However, we currently are working
on a viable defence.

00:51.088 --> 00:53.174
Defence?

00:53.340 --> 00:55.885
Really?

00:56.052 --> 00:58.804
We've been here two days
before you mention that?

00:58.971 --> 01:01.390
I had to learn that you could be trusted.

01:01.557 --> 01:04.518
Are you talking
about a defensive weapon?

01:04.685 --> 01:09.398
You could say that. Something we hope
will protect us from another Wraith culling.

01:09.565 --> 01:12.318
- You expect it to happen again?
- Of course.

01:12.485 --> 01:17.114
But if they return as they have historically,
they won't be here for 50 years.

01:17.281 --> 01:19.367
50 years, you say?

01:21.494 --> 01:25.581
- How about that weapon?
- Yes, if you'll just come this way.

01:25.748 --> 01:29.168
You haven't told him
we woke the Wraith from hibernation.

01:29.335 --> 01:31.670
Well, I really haven't had the chance.

01:31.837 --> 01:34.673
- We've been here two days.
- One and a half, really.

01:34.840 --> 01:38.511
Major, they're not expecting the Wraith
for another 50 years.

01:38.677 --> 01:43.557
- They could show up at any time.
- Why don't you tell them?

01:46.435 --> 01:50.064
- Reminds you of Area 51, doesn't it?
- Circa 1918.

01:50.231 --> 01:52.316
Area 51 wasn't around in 1918, sir.

01:52.483 --> 01:54.360
- The area was.
- True.

01:54.527 --> 01:59.949
- These people couldn't have a weapon...
- Weapons come in all shapes and sizes.

02:03.369 --> 02:07.248
Major Sheppard,
I think you'll find this intriguing.

02:09.917 --> 02:15.715
OK. I'm intrigued. What is it?

02:15.881 --> 02:20.344
Something that we hope will one day
make us completely immune to the Wraith.

03:30.998 --> 03:34.585
Druhin says their drug
is several years from being finished.

03:34.752 --> 03:38.756
Given their current level of technology,
that could be an understatement.

03:38.923 --> 03:41.759
They only believe
they're close to a breakthrough.

03:41.926 --> 03:46.806
You saw their entire civilisation
is based on the completion of that goal.

03:46.972 --> 03:49.558
I would not underestimate them.

03:49.725 --> 03:53.062
Do we know for sure
that the Wraith are an immediate threat?

03:53.229 --> 03:56.023
We can probably bet
they don't have 50 years.

03:56.190 --> 03:59.819
Hence Major Sheppard has generously
offered the Hoffans our help.

03:59.985 --> 04:01.487
Has he?

04:02.988 --> 04:09.578
The fact is if they're onto something.
Maybe we can speed up the process.

04:10.996 --> 04:12.873
OK, Major, you have a go.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.712
- But if the drug is just a pipe dream...
- Dr Beckett's volunteered to help us.

04:17.878 --> 04:20.130
Oh, he has, huh?

04:20.297 --> 04:22.216
He will.

04:25.261 --> 04:28.347
- It's not that I mind lending a hand.
- Of course not.

04:28.514 --> 04:31.642
- You're a generous man.
- But it's the principle.

04:31.809 --> 04:35.062
You can't volunteer someone
without consulting them first.

04:35.229 --> 04:39.233
That's not even volunteering.
It's being pressed into service.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.820
- And I'm not...
- In the military. I can't give you orders.

04:42.987 --> 04:46.949
- He won't go through the Stargate.
- He's worse than Dr McCoy.

04:47.116 --> 04:51.412
- Who?
- The TV character that Dr Beckett plays.

04:51.579 --> 04:56.625
Converting a human body into energy and
sending it through a wormhole... insanity.

04:56.792 --> 05:00.796
- How often do you go to an alien planet?
- I was already on one.

05:07.428 --> 05:11.015
- Should you be messing with that stuff?
- I know what I'm doing.

05:11.182 --> 05:13.225
They've mastered a few basics.

05:13.392 --> 05:17.229
Biochemistry, physiology, perhaps
even some form of molecular biology.

05:17.396 --> 05:19.815
- Fairly impressive...
- Our people's legacy.

05:19.982 --> 05:24.195
This room represents hundreds of years
of medical knowledge.

05:24.361 --> 05:27.490
I am Perna, chief scientist for the project.

05:27.656 --> 05:32.536
John Sheppard. Oh, and this is Teyla
and Lieutenant Ford.

05:32.703 --> 05:37.583
Carson. Beckett. Doctor.
I mean, call me Carson.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.127
I'm Dr McKay. Dr Rodney McKay.

05:44.507 --> 05:46.801
I hope you find our facilities suitable.

05:46.967 --> 05:50.888
Oh, they're charming. Perfectly charming.

05:52.848 --> 05:57.645
Long ago this city was a testament
to our imagination, our creative spirit,

05:57.812 --> 05:59.480
to endless possibility.

05:59.647 --> 06:01.190
How long ago was that?

06:01.357 --> 06:04.944
We have been forced to rebuild
many times, never to our potential.

06:05.111 --> 06:08.030
That is why perfecting the drug
is so important.

06:08.197 --> 06:11.826
It is more than a defence
against the Wraith. It is our future.

06:11.992 --> 06:16.330
With respect, you cannot prevent
the culling. It is a fact of existence.

06:16.497 --> 06:21.293
A fact we challenge. We will always seek
to end the cycle of destruction.

06:21.460 --> 06:24.505
The Wraith will prevent any race
from advancing too far.

06:24.672 --> 06:29.093
- You figure you can beat 'em?
- Yes. Through knowledge.

06:46.777 --> 06:50.239
A number of archives like this
are hidden throughout the city.

06:50.406 --> 06:53.242
Their existence is known only to a few.

06:53.409 --> 06:57.455
This is very impressive.

06:57.621 --> 07:01.000
We preserve the accomplishments
of each generation

07:01.167 --> 07:03.711
before they are wiped out by the Wraith.

07:03.878 --> 07:06.505
So everything your people learned
is in here.

07:06.672 --> 07:08.758
And in other identical archives.

07:08.924 --> 07:12.553
In case they destroy one.
You guys are serious about this.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.181
Standing on the shoulders
of our forefathers.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.933
How long have you worked
on this Wraith drug?

07:18.100 --> 07:22.938
150 years ago our scientists were close
to creating a viable prototype,

07:23.105 --> 07:25.232
but died before seeing its fruition.

07:25.399 --> 07:29.153
You're hoping that if this world's
no good to them, they'll move on?

07:29.320 --> 07:32.281
The Wraith cannot possibly
perceive us as a threat.

07:32.448 --> 07:35.910
To tell you the truth,
I don't know how they would react.

07:36.077 --> 07:40.247
If they choose to wipe you
out of existence, you will be helpless.

07:40.414 --> 07:42.625
We cannot hope to control their actions.

07:42.792 --> 07:47.713
We can only do what we can to end
a cycle that has gone on for far too long.

07:49.507 --> 07:52.760
His name was Farrol Mylan.

07:52.927 --> 07:57.723
Before he died in the last culling, he was
one of our most celebrated researchers.

07:57.890 --> 07:59.975
He was the one who found it.

08:00.142 --> 08:02.395
- Found what?
- The key.

08:02.561 --> 08:06.857
His journals tell of one man who survived
an encounter with the Wraith.

08:07.024 --> 08:11.362
Farrol and his team discovered
that this man possessed a unique protein.

08:11.529 --> 08:16.617
He could resist the chemical released by
the Wraith to drain life from their victims.

08:16.784 --> 08:19.328
After painstaking trial and error...

08:19.495 --> 08:22.331
Farrol made a copy of the protein.

08:22.498 --> 08:26.043
He was eventually able to create
a prototype of a drug

08:26.210 --> 08:28.713
to interfere
with the Wraith feeding process.

08:28.879 --> 08:33.842
- And it worked?
- He was killed before it could be used.

08:34.009 --> 08:38.972
And it's been your job to make certain
his work wasn't in vain.

08:39.140 --> 08:42.393
- Quite the responsibility.
- It is a great honour.

08:44.770 --> 08:49.775
How do you know that this Farrol
wasn't just embellishing his results?

08:49.942 --> 08:53.195
Or making them up.
All you have to go on are his notes.

08:53.362 --> 08:56.449
He and his team worked
until the last possible moment.

08:56.615 --> 09:00.953
They knew the Wraith ships were
overhead and worked through the night,

09:01.120 --> 09:05.082
hoping to provide one more insight,
one last thread of knowledge.

09:05.249 --> 09:09.420
Not for themselves,
but for the generation that would survive.

09:14.175 --> 09:18.721
10,000 soldiers gave their lives
to give them those last few hours.

09:18.888 --> 09:23.392
The last words of Farrol's journal
are known to all Hoffans.

09:24.435 --> 09:27.396
I meant no disrespect, Perna.

09:28.689 --> 09:33.944
It's all right. More than just his journals
survived the culling.

09:34.111 --> 09:38.532
His research materials
were safeguarded as well,

09:38.699 --> 09:44.038
including carefully preserved
Wraith cell samples,

09:44.205 --> 09:47.625
which we still use in our work today.

09:47.792 --> 09:49.877
Please.

09:53.255 --> 09:55.341
See for yourself.

10:07.686 --> 10:09.772
That's incredible.

10:17.029 --> 10:18.906
I saw it with my own eyes.

10:19.073 --> 10:23.285
In a Petri dish. We are talking
about 150-year-old Wraith cells.

10:23.452 --> 10:26.747
For all we know
they could be immune to the drug by now.

10:26.914 --> 10:28.457
I don't think so.

10:28.624 --> 10:30.960
I ran a few tests of my own

10:31.127 --> 10:34.839
using cells from the Wraith arm
Major Sheppard brought from Athos.

10:35.005 --> 10:38.467
The results were the same.
Near complete resistance.

10:38.634 --> 10:41.595
They've got something.
I'm more surprised than anyone.

10:41.762 --> 10:44.140
So what do you recommend?

10:44.306 --> 10:46.809
That we take their work to the next level.

10:46.976 --> 10:49.812
I've informed the Hoffans
of our guest in the brig.

10:49.979 --> 10:52.481
You realise what you're asking for?

10:52.648 --> 10:55.443
I do.

11:02.658 --> 11:06.495
- Anything I should know about?
- No, sir, he's been quiet.

11:06.662 --> 11:10.249
- Still trying to make you see things?
- He's given up on that.

11:10.416 --> 11:12.501
I didn't think he'd last this long.

11:23.721 --> 11:26.057
Hello again, Major Sheppard.

11:30.853 --> 11:33.189
Sorry if I woke you.

11:33.355 --> 11:36.317
Just came by to see
if there was anything you needed.

11:36.484 --> 11:38.652
Magazine, fresh towels.

11:38.819 --> 11:42.323
You hide your fear poorly, Major.

11:42.490 --> 11:48.120
We've been talking for a couple of weeks
now and I don't even know your name.

11:48.287 --> 11:50.164
You guys do have names?

11:51.207 --> 11:54.251
Let me guess. Steve?

11:54.418 --> 11:58.714
I am your death.
That is all you need to know.

11:58.881 --> 12:01.133
I prefer Steve.

12:06.764 --> 12:08.849
What do you hope to gain from this?

12:09.016 --> 12:13.354
Just trying to bridge the gap between
our cultures, get to know you better.

12:14.438 --> 12:19.360
And trying to figure out how to keep your
kind from sucking the life out of people.

12:19.527 --> 12:24.782
Even if I told you what you want to know,
it would change nothing.

12:24.949 --> 12:29.912
You are doomed, as are any humans
that stand in our way.

12:30.079 --> 12:32.748
Can't be a nice way to die.

12:32.915 --> 12:35.584
Hungry, slow,

12:37.002 --> 12:41.549
knowing your food source
is just out of reach.

12:41.716 --> 12:43.592
<i>(yells)</i>

12:43.759 --> 12:47.638
- Why do you keep me here?
- I need to know what we're up against.

12:47.805 --> 12:52.643
For example, how many of those hive
ships have you got and where are they?

12:52.810 --> 12:55.521
You have nothing to offer me in return.

12:57.022 --> 13:00.818
We could talk about easing your hunger...

13:02.278 --> 13:03.821
Steve.

13:04.530 --> 13:07.742
You would never sacrifice
one of your own kind.

13:07.908 --> 13:14.999
And yet it is all that stands between you
and the information you seek.

13:26.218 --> 13:30.264
Using living Wraith cells
is our only recourse at this juncture.

13:30.431 --> 13:34.185
Without them we have no way of knowing
if the drug is viable.

13:34.351 --> 13:38.147
You said it worked on the cells
of the severed Wraith arm.

13:38.314 --> 13:42.985
It did, but those were already
in a partially decayed state.

13:43.152 --> 13:44.612
We need live samples.

13:44.779 --> 13:48.699
With new samples you think it's possible
to create a prototype?

13:48.866 --> 13:50.826
Given enough time, yes, I do.

13:50.993 --> 13:53.329
He's got a point.
The Hoffans are obsessed.

13:53.496 --> 13:55.581
- Thank you, Rodney.
- I agree.

13:55.748 --> 13:58.084
But their obsession may be their undoing.

13:58.250 --> 14:03.547
Even if they do undo, it'd be good for us.
Wouldn't you want to be immune?

14:03.714 --> 14:06.592
Not if it meant
the lives the Wraith might spare.

14:06.759 --> 14:10.179
This drug would only be of value

14:10.346 --> 14:14.350
if everyone everywhere
possessed the same immunity.

14:14.517 --> 14:17.228
There's a thought worth pursuing.

14:17.395 --> 14:19.146
<i>(Weir) I agree.</i>

14:19.313 --> 14:22.441
Major, have you made any progress
with your prisoner?

14:22.608 --> 14:25.236
Not yet, but he just blinked.

14:25.403 --> 14:27.905
He blinked? What does that mean?

14:28.072 --> 14:32.201
He's still holding on, but he's indicated
to me that he may break soon.

14:32.368 --> 14:36.414
- And he indicated this to you by blinking?
- Yes.

14:36.580 --> 14:39.667
No offence, Major, but so far
he hasn't told you a thing.

14:39.834 --> 14:45.673
He could linger this way for months
and ultimately we'll learn nothing.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.259
The Wraith could be on their way to Hoff.

14:48.426 --> 14:52.763
If your prisoner holds the key
to the creation of this drug,

14:52.930 --> 14:55.015
should we not take advantage of this?

14:55.182 --> 14:57.977
How could we get the sample
off him safely?

14:58.144 --> 15:00.563
We possess the weapons
used in his capture.

15:00.730 --> 15:03.941
It would be a simple matter
of incapacitating him again.

15:04.108 --> 15:07.528
- So, then, it's possible?
- It's possible.

15:15.828 --> 15:17.204
Hi, Steve.

15:17.371 --> 15:18.748
<i>(growls)</i>

15:18.914 --> 15:20.666
Bye, Steve.

15:32.887 --> 15:34.972
Doctor.

15:35.139 --> 15:39.477
- Is he... You're certain he's...
- He's down, doc.

15:39.643 --> 15:41.479
Do your thing.

15:48.486 --> 15:53.532
- Almost looks peaceful, doesn't he?
- Peaceful? You're out of your mind.

16:06.087 --> 16:08.923
I have never seen devices such as these.

16:09.090 --> 16:12.385
The work you've done refining the drug
has been good.

16:12.551 --> 16:16.055
With all this, we can make it better.

16:17.848 --> 16:21.394
Your biggest problem
is that the test inoculations

16:21.560 --> 16:24.980
failed to show enough presence
in human cells to be effective.

16:25.147 --> 16:27.775
- We need a better delivery system.
- Exactly.

16:27.942 --> 16:32.697
We'll recreate the key protein in the
serum and work our way up from there.

16:32.863 --> 16:35.866
If we can avoid re-engineering it
from a natural source

16:36.033 --> 16:38.202
and make an entirely synthetic version,

16:38.369 --> 16:40.496
it should increase the efficiency.

16:40.663 --> 16:46.001
- Such a thing is possible?
- Anything's possible if you give it a go.

16:46.168 --> 16:49.422
Come on, then.
A bald head is soon shaved.

16:50.798 --> 16:54.385
You speak differently than the others.

16:54.552 --> 16:56.846
You noticed that, did you?

16:57.012 --> 17:02.143
Sorry if I confuse you. Trust me, where
I come from, it all makes perfect sense.

17:02.309 --> 17:06.105
- What is it like?
- Scotland? Oh, I think it's beautiful.

17:06.271 --> 17:09.108
But I'm told it's something
of an acquired taste.

17:09.275 --> 17:14.113
I meant your world. It must be so peaceful
there, knowing the Wraith will not come.

17:14.280 --> 17:18.200
You'd be surprised
how not peaceful it is.

17:19.117 --> 17:21.537
We're spoiled rotten,
now that I think of it.

17:23.247 --> 17:25.624
You miss it. I'm sorry for enquiring.

17:25.790 --> 17:28.044
Oh, no. Don't be, love.

18:34.568 --> 18:37.697
One can see the various
refraction changes required

18:37.863 --> 18:42.743
to complete the preliminary stage required
to boil down the base material.

19:01.470 --> 19:03.556
Perna.

19:18.946 --> 19:23.034
100%% % cellular penetration
in all five test inoculations. Incredible.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.705
There's still a lot of data to be analysed,
but the initial results are promising.

19:27.872 --> 19:31.083
Dr Beckett's efforts
have advanced the project by decades.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.794
Perna's formula was right on track.

19:33.961 --> 19:38.799
It was a matter of changing its molecular
design to be better absorbed by the body.

19:38.966 --> 19:43.054
This is an enormous victory for
our people. I don't know how to thank you.

19:43.220 --> 19:46.599
No need. Of course, it's only a preliminary.

19:46.766 --> 19:49.935
How soon until you can set up
the next stage of testing?

19:50.102 --> 19:52.104
You'll have a schedule later today.

19:53.647 --> 19:55.191
I'm sorry. Next stage?

19:55.357 --> 20:00.363
Your report makes it clear that the project
is ready to proceed to its next phase.

20:00.529 --> 20:04.950
We want to test the serum's effectiveness
against your prisoner.

20:11.874 --> 20:13.751
You support this?

20:13.918 --> 20:18.464
He's gonna die, so we might as well
make good use of him while he's alive.

20:18.631 --> 20:24.470
The Geneva Convention prohibits
using prisoners for scientific experiments.

20:24.637 --> 20:28.682
No offence, doc, but had the Wraith
attended the Geneva Convention,

20:28.849 --> 20:32.728
they would have tried
to feed on everyone there.

20:32.895 --> 20:38.234
Beckett's report indicates we have no idea
of the long-term effect on humans.

20:38.401 --> 20:41.779
We know what the long-term effects
of Wraith culling are.

20:41.946 --> 20:45.950
We're talking about putting a human
in the same room as a starving Wraith.

20:46.117 --> 20:50.788
- Once we start down that road...
- Which road did you think we were on?

20:50.955 --> 20:54.959
Not this one. At least not this fast.

20:55.835 --> 20:59.755
Having spent time with the prisoner,
I don't pity him.

20:59.922 --> 21:02.049
He's gonna die anyway.

21:04.844 --> 21:08.556
- This drug could be useful someday.
- Someday.

21:08.723 --> 21:12.727
The point is, we don't get
a lot of opportunities like this.

21:12.893 --> 21:15.062
Do you know how obsessed
the Hoffans are?

21:15.229 --> 21:18.107
When they found out
we had a live Wraith prisoner...

21:18.899 --> 21:21.485
He's going to die.

21:21.652 --> 21:26.073
I tried to feed him live stuff, but apparently
there's only one item on his menu.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.910
What about the test subject?
If the drug fails...

21:30.077 --> 21:31.954
We're not just grabbing anybody.

21:32.121 --> 21:36.625
The test subject is a terminally ill patient
who has volunteered himself.

21:38.711 --> 21:43.841
These are not exactly the type of decisions
I expected to make on this expedition.

21:55.728 --> 21:58.731
Do it.

22:10.451 --> 22:11.827
Hi, Steve.

22:11.994 --> 22:14.413
More samples?

22:14.580 --> 22:17.291
I was thinking more of a field trip.

22:17.458 --> 22:21.253
You want sustenance, I want information.

22:23.422 --> 22:27.134
You are incapable of offering such a trade.

22:27.301 --> 22:32.723
You tell me something of value,
I let you eat.

22:32.890 --> 22:35.935
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

22:40.523 --> 22:42.400
Very well.

22:51.742 --> 22:53.411
Are they ready?

22:53.577 --> 22:57.081
Major Sheppard is loading the prisoner
into Jumper Two.

22:57.248 --> 23:02.837
Sergeant Bates is standing by
for their arrival at the rendezvous site.

23:21.439 --> 23:23.607
Jumper Two, what's your status?

23:23.774 --> 23:26.027
<i>(Sheppard) Cosy in here. Ready to depart.</i>

23:26.193 --> 23:28.988
<i>- (Weir) Be safe, Major.
- That's the plan.</i>

23:29.155 --> 23:32.575
<i>- Jumper Two, you are go for launch.
- Roger that.</i>

23:34.285 --> 23:36.412
Dial it up.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.794
This isn't supposed to be fun.

24:04.565 --> 24:07.693
Perna explained to me about your illness.

24:07.860 --> 24:10.738
I want you to know how sorry I am.

24:10.905 --> 24:13.949
I wish there was something
I could do for you.

24:14.116 --> 24:16.494
It's my time, Dr Beckett.

24:16.660 --> 24:19.413
I'm at peace with my fate.

24:19.580 --> 24:25.461
It's important you know that we may be
talking about a less than peaceful ending.

24:25.628 --> 24:30.674
<i>(Perna) I have explained to Merell
in great detail what may befall him.</i>

24:30.841 --> 24:37.014
<i>(Beckett) You should know this drug has
only worked in a laboratory simulation.</i>

24:37.181 --> 24:40.101
We don't know for certain
what will happen.

24:40.267 --> 24:44.814
Even if it doesn't work,
you'll learn something of value,

24:46.440 --> 24:49.026
how to perfect it in the future.

24:49.193 --> 24:54.407
<i>(Beckett) Possibly, but that's no reason
for you to face that creature.</i>

24:55.408 --> 24:59.036
Dr Beckett, I'm not afraid.

24:59.203 --> 25:02.498
No matter what happens,
my death will have meaning.

25:03.666 --> 25:09.213
Is that not something we all strive for,
to die knowing we made a difference?

25:09.380 --> 25:11.966
I want to do this.

25:12.133 --> 25:16.262
Please don't deny me the chance
to help my people.

25:25.062 --> 25:29.025
- What do you think?
- It goes against everything I believe in.

25:29.191 --> 25:31.902
There's an oath among medical people.

25:32.069 --> 25:34.655
It begins, "First, do no harm."

25:34.822 --> 25:38.701
- Important words to you.
- More than words, Perna.

25:38.868 --> 25:42.955
"The battle rages at the very threshold
of our laboratory now."

25:43.122 --> 25:47.084
"We know that these few final hours
have been dearly purchased,

25:47.251 --> 25:50.546
yet our concentration has not waned."

25:50.713 --> 25:52.798
"We cannot hope to save ourselves,

25:52.965 --> 25:58.512
but we can hope that one last insight,
one last revelation before we die

25:58.679 --> 26:02.808
may prevent this terrible day
from happening again."

26:02.975 --> 26:05.061
Farrol's last journal entry.

26:06.062 --> 26:08.147
More than words, Carson.

26:08.314 --> 26:11.650
I understand that. I do.
But there are too many unknowns.

26:11.817 --> 26:14.862
- We need time to determine...
- There is no time.

26:15.029 --> 26:19.825
Are you so afraid of making a mistake
that you can't see what we're up against?

26:19.992 --> 26:24.830
This isn't about making mistakes, Perna.
It's about the end justifying the means.

26:24.997 --> 26:28.084
In our profession,
that's a very slippery slope.

26:30.086 --> 26:32.380
We have no idea if this'll work.

26:32.546 --> 26:35.424
We could be sacrificing that man
to a monster.

26:36.300 --> 26:39.095
There will be another to take his place.

26:40.346 --> 26:42.848
That's just what I'm afraid of.

26:49.313 --> 26:51.649
<i>(Teyla) They are ready.</i>

26:55.277 --> 26:57.363
<i>(Ford) Careful, sir.</i>

27:08.582 --> 27:11.127
This is the sustenance you promised?

27:11.293 --> 27:14.296
A little change in plans.

27:14.463 --> 27:19.218
You tell me something right now
or the dinner party's cancelled.

27:19.385 --> 27:20.928
What do you want to know?

27:21.095 --> 27:25.224
How many hive ships have become
operational since we awakened one?

27:25.391 --> 27:27.727
All of them, Major Sheppard.

27:27.893 --> 27:32.732
First they will travel their own
feeding grounds and gather strength.

27:33.649 --> 27:35.985
We are a patient race, Major.

27:36.777 --> 27:40.364
When we have taken our fill
and gathered our strength,

27:40.531 --> 27:44.160
we will join force and come for you.

27:44.326 --> 27:48.247
Do you have any idea when that'll be?
Morning, afternoon?

27:48.414 --> 27:51.208
<i>(groans)</i>

27:52.376 --> 27:54.712
Open it up.

28:05.431 --> 28:07.975
You don't have to do this.

28:08.976 --> 28:11.979
I know.

28:12.146 --> 28:14.565
I'm ready.

28:15.816 --> 28:19.695
<i>(breathes deeply)</i>

28:41.092 --> 28:43.803
He is weak.

29:30.516 --> 29:33.519
You are both heroes of the Hoffan people.

29:33.686 --> 29:35.771
I'll admit, it was amazing.

29:35.938 --> 29:39.608
I hope your friends will join us
for a banquet to honour your work.

29:39.775 --> 29:43.320
They'd be glad to,
but aren't celebrations a bit premature?

29:43.487 --> 29:45.865
The results speak for themselves.

29:46.032 --> 29:50.161
I intend to ask the Council to approve
mass production of the serum.

29:50.327 --> 29:53.164
After today I doubt
they will offer any resistance.

29:53.330 --> 29:57.001
- That is wonderful news.
- With all due respect, it isn't.

29:57.168 --> 29:59.086
We're talking about one test here.

29:59.253 --> 30:02.298
I'm as pleased as anyone
with the results,

30:02.465 --> 30:05.342
but we have a lot of work to do
before we can use it.

30:05.509 --> 30:09.513
Dr Beckett wishes to run
a full series of tests on Merell

30:09.680 --> 30:11.849
prior to issuing his final report.

30:12.016 --> 30:16.520
There may have been mitigating
circumstances. The man was dying.

30:16.687 --> 30:19.523
Of course. I'll bring it up with Council.

30:20.316 --> 30:22.610
To success.

30:25.863 --> 30:29.158
- What is it?
- Steve. He doesn't look so good.

30:30.117 --> 30:31.744
<i>(groans)</i>

30:31.911 --> 30:34.747
- How long has he been like this?
- Since the test.

30:34.914 --> 30:37.750
- Think it's a ruse?
- It is not their way.

30:43.923 --> 30:46.133
Hey.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.511
What have you done to me?

31:05.653 --> 31:08.823
- We need Beckett in here.
- Go.

31:15.079 --> 31:17.164
We're gonna help you.

31:19.125 --> 31:21.252
Don't feel pity for me.

31:23.379 --> 31:27.967
You will suffer far worse
when the others come for you.

31:29.927 --> 31:33.264
<i>(gasps)</i>

31:50.531 --> 31:53.659
Major. I was just about to cut him open.

31:53.826 --> 31:55.911
Then I was just leaving.

31:56.078 --> 32:00.332
I've already done a series of tests
you might like to know the results of.

32:00.499 --> 32:01.959
You know what killed him?

32:02.126 --> 32:06.839
It was all of his vital organs
shutting down almost simultaneously.

32:07.006 --> 32:09.967
- Did he starve to death?
- No.

32:10.134 --> 32:13.387
I don't think he died
from a lack of nourishment.

32:13.554 --> 32:14.930
What was it?

32:15.097 --> 32:18.684
Tests revealed a significant amount
of Hoffan serum in his blood.

32:18.851 --> 32:23.731
I'm guessing we'll find similar
trace amounts in each of his organs.

32:23.898 --> 32:26.901
Why did the Hoffan drug
end up in his blood?

32:27.068 --> 32:32.948
We know that when the Wraith feed, they
release a chemical to their victims' bodies.

32:33.115 --> 32:35.868
What it does we don't yet understand.

32:36.035 --> 32:40.998
I can only assume that it prepares
the human body to be drained of life.

32:41.165 --> 32:46.253
The serum is designed to shield the victim
from that initial chemical release.

32:46.420 --> 32:47.797
OK.

32:47.963 --> 32:51.842
The serum protein may have mutated
when exposed to the chemical,

32:52.009 --> 32:54.095
triggering a toxic reaction.

32:54.261 --> 32:58.849
- Instead of feeding off him...
- He was poisoned.

32:59.016 --> 33:03.771
So if the serum did this, it's more
than just a defence against the Wraith.

33:04.647 --> 33:07.149
It kills them.

33:07.483 --> 33:13.322
I fail to see cause for alarm. This
development increases the serum's value.

33:13.489 --> 33:18.411
No, it takes away any doubt about what
the Wraith will do when they come here.

33:18.577 --> 33:20.121
I don't see the difference.

33:20.287 --> 33:22.790
Once they learn you possess this weapon,

33:22.957 --> 33:27.086
the Wraith will wipe your people
from existence in retaliation.

33:27.253 --> 33:32.383
Or they may simply leave us alone
once they learn we are unpalatable.

33:32.550 --> 33:35.845
'Cause they're such
a live-and-let-live kind of race.

33:36.011 --> 33:40.307
Maybe when you were talking about
this being defensive, but now...

33:40.474 --> 33:42.393
You fail to see the larger picture.

33:42.560 --> 33:46.564
For the first time we have a way
to not just defend, but strike back.

33:46.731 --> 33:50.484
Is this about revenge
or saving your people?

33:50.651 --> 33:54.613
You can't hope to understand
the generations of suffering.

33:54.780 --> 33:58.617
I've been in one of their hives
and fought against their ships.

33:58.784 --> 34:02.830
When the first Wraith dies
because of this drug, they won't move on.

34:02.997 --> 34:05.082
They'll make the problem go away.

34:05.249 --> 34:10.963
They will seek out any who have had
contact with you. They will spare no one.

34:11.130 --> 34:16.135
I know how passionate you are about this.
This drug is sort of your Holy Grail.

34:16.302 --> 34:19.722
- You're gonna have to shelve it until...
- No.

34:19.889 --> 34:24.060
I'm serious.
Otherwise we can't help you any more.

34:24.226 --> 34:27.228
You don't understand, Major. It's too late.

34:27.396 --> 34:31.275
I have made my recommendation
to the Council and they've agreed.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.362
We have already begun
inoculating our people.

34:53.880 --> 34:56.175
You're leaving?

34:56.342 --> 35:00.596
Unless you'll go back to formula on
the serum, there's no point in my staying.

35:00.763 --> 35:02.473
Re-open the project.

35:02.640 --> 35:07.144
With more work we could prevent the
mutation, maintain it as a defensive drug.

35:07.311 --> 35:09.063
Merell is dead.

35:10.189 --> 35:12.983
The cause of death
is still to be determined.

35:13.150 --> 35:15.903
- They need to stop the inoculations.
- They won't.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.323
- A man is dead.
- More won't necessarily follow.

35:19.490 --> 35:21.575
<i>(sighs)</i>

35:21.742 --> 35:24.537
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't make them stop.

35:24.704 --> 35:26.872
Not without more proof.

35:28.582 --> 35:32.586
Perna, you're one of
the brightest people I've ever met.

35:32.753 --> 35:36.632
For your own sake, I beg you,

35:36.799 --> 35:39.009
have no more part in this.

35:39.176 --> 35:41.637
At least until we know more.

35:44.181 --> 35:46.809
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

35:46.976 --> 35:51.230
Because I was among the first
to be inoculated.

35:55.860 --> 35:58.112
I appreciate your sense of urgency,

35:58.279 --> 36:01.782
but at this point it would be unwise
to rush to any conclusions.

36:01.949 --> 36:04.493
You want to exercise caution?
Are you serious?

36:04.660 --> 36:08.706
You yourself have told us the Wraith
could be on their way here right now.

36:08.873 --> 36:10.666
We have to move forward.

36:10.833 --> 36:13.711
You're speaking
on behalf of a lot of people.

36:13.878 --> 36:16.213
You think I'd force this choice
on my people?

36:16.380 --> 36:19.717
No, sir, our people
are in complete agreement.

36:19.884 --> 36:24.138
Your people may be dead before
the Wraith even get here, for all you know.

36:24.305 --> 36:26.557
Chancellor, please. It's not too late.

36:26.724 --> 36:29.894
Suspend the inoculations
until we know what killed Merell.

36:30.061 --> 36:33.314
He was terminal. We don't know
the serum caused his death.

36:33.481 --> 36:35.983
He suffered
a complete respiratory breakdown.

36:36.150 --> 36:40.696
Which could have been due
to his condition. His sickness had spread.

36:40.863 --> 36:44.950
Are you willing to risk lives
based on that assumption? I'm not.

36:46.285 --> 36:49.205
<i>- Major Sheppard.
- Go ahead, Teyla.</i>

36:49.372 --> 36:53.334
We're in the medical centre. We need help.

37:05.179 --> 37:07.973
My God.

37:09.975 --> 37:15.856
The doctors say they began arriving last
night and their numbers are increasing.

37:16.023 --> 37:21.946
I'm on it. Lieutenant, radio Weir. Tell them
we need a full medical team on a jumper.

37:22.113 --> 37:24.198
Roger that.

37:34.792 --> 37:38.921
<i>(Beckett) Perna. Perna.</i>

37:39.088 --> 37:42.591
I need help here. Oxygen!

37:42.758 --> 37:44.468
Take it easy.

37:59.817 --> 38:01.902
Leave us.

38:03.112 --> 38:06.532
- Do you have any idea what's going on?
- I do, Major.

38:06.699 --> 38:11.245
- Half those who took that drug are dying.
- Half of them, Major. Half.

38:12.163 --> 38:15.833
The statistics are clear
and the numbers are holding at that level.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.837
Which means the other 50%% %
of those we inoculated will live

38:20.004 --> 38:22.256
and destroy any Wraith who feed on them.

38:22.423 --> 38:24.216
I don't believe this.

38:24.383 --> 38:27.678
The Wraith will know the full conviction
of the Hoffan people.

38:27.845 --> 38:33.351
- Conviction?
- If we spread this drug to every human,

38:33.517 --> 38:37.229
future generations would never know
the horror of a culling.

38:37.396 --> 38:40.524
You're deliberately sacrificing
millions of lives.

38:40.691 --> 38:43.235
An end to the Wraith.

38:44.487 --> 38:46.739
You can't comprehend the bargain in that?

38:46.906 --> 38:49.992
You can't make a bargain like that
for your entire people.

38:50.159 --> 38:53.579
- Do you think I'm alone in this?
- I think you're delusional.

38:53.746 --> 38:57.208
You shall see. We are putting it
to a vote as we speak.

38:57.375 --> 39:00.669
I will stand by the decision
of the majority.

39:01.754 --> 39:06.133
- Does that satisfy you?
- Do they know what they're voting on?

39:08.260 --> 39:10.721
Yes. I promise you.

39:10.888 --> 39:15.059
- You'll back off if it doesn't go your way?
- You have my word.

39:22.942 --> 39:28.823
Use any rooms you need for overflow.
We need to keep this area clear for triage.

39:33.119 --> 39:37.456
Teyla, there you are. Make sure oxygen
is properly deployed in the hospital.

39:37.623 --> 39:41.794
- Doctor...
- Have non-critical patients use it in turns.

39:43.671 --> 39:47.216
Teyla, you're not listening to me.
Where's Perna? I need her.

39:47.383 --> 39:49.301
Carson.

40:08.529 --> 40:13.034
I would... like to have seen Atlantis.

40:15.870 --> 40:19.915
Perna, I'm so sorry.

40:21.625 --> 40:24.795
Don't look at me that way.

40:25.713 --> 40:30.468
I am at peace with what I have done,
as you should be.

40:31.719 --> 40:33.971
I wish I had no part in this.

40:35.014 --> 40:37.349
You gave us hope.

40:39.060 --> 40:42.855
For years our people have been working

40:43.022 --> 40:47.234
towards this very moment.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.158
We didn't betray the forefathers.

40:55.368 --> 41:00.289
We fulfilled their destiny, their promise.

41:08.005 --> 41:12.134
Stay. Stay with me. Stay.

41:12.301 --> 41:14.387
I'm here.

41:17.681 --> 41:20.142
It's OK.

41:34.990 --> 41:37.535
- You OK?
- Aye.

41:41.997 --> 41:45.292
- I'm told you're leaving.
- Yes, we are.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.837
Not that it hasn't been... lovely.

41:48.003 --> 41:52.133
I wanted you to see the results
of the vote before you left.

41:58.973 --> 42:01.225
96%% % in favour.

42:01.392 --> 42:05.146
- Does the vote include all your people?
- Every one.

42:05.312 --> 42:09.066
So you see, Major, we speak
with one voice and we are resolute.

42:09.233 --> 42:11.527
Yeah, I can see that.

42:12.486 --> 42:17.324
Next time I'd like to discuss disseminating
the drug on as many worlds as possible.

42:17.491 --> 42:22.329
- We won't be doing that any time soon.
- Our victory may change your mind.

42:22.496 --> 42:27.293
If and when we ever return,
I don't imagine you'll be here.

42:27.460 --> 42:30.838
I don't imagine
anybody else will be either.

42:40.890 --> 42:42.975
Good luck.

42:48.397 --> 42:52.693
"Victory at all costs."
That sound familiar, Major?

42:52.860 --> 42:56.572
- Churchill.
- Aye. Never thought I'd disagree.
