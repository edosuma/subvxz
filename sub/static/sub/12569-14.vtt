00:31.449 --> 00:32.533
Why ask her?

00:32.575 --> 00:33.681
Yeah, she's just

00:33.682 --> 00:34.786
an oversized gecko.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.037
Call her an oversized

00:36.038 --> 00:37.246

- A broken kneecap.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.101
You took Tony's uncle

00:59.102 --> 01:00.102

01:00.144 --> 01:02.271
No, it was an accident.

01:02.313 --> 01:03.606
