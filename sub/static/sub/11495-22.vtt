00:01.353 --> 00:02.859
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Two and a Half Men...

00:02.959 --> 00:04.592
You seem awfully quiet tonight.
Is everything okay?

00:04.594 --> 00:06.894
I-I've just got
a lot on my mind.

00:06.896 --> 00:09.681
Well, a problem shared
is a problem halved.

00:09.683 --> 00:11.232
I think we should break up.

00:11.234 --> 00:13.601
Lyndsey's downstairs
breaking up with Alan.

00:13.603 --> 00:14.736
Really?

00:14.738 --> 00:16.470
He's gonna be
devastated.

00:16.472 --> 00:18.773
He was madly in love with her.
They've been dating for years.

00:18.775 --> 00:20.041
They were planning
on getting married.

00:20.043 --> 00:21.693
I-I still love you, Alan.

00:22.745 --> 00:25.363
I'm just not in love
with you anymore.

00:26.148 --> 00:26.981
Hey, Zip.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.533
Just want to be left alone.

00:28.535 --> 00:30.585
Lyndsey's crazy
for breaking up with you.

00:30.587 --> 00:32.086
You are a great guy.

00:32.088 --> 00:33.004
Thank you.

00:33.006 --> 00:34.672
You'll find somebody else.

00:34.674 --> 00:36.007
As good as Lyndsey?

00:36.009 --> 00:37.291
Look at you.

00:37.293 --> 00:39.493
Already making jokes.

00:46.135 --> 00:48.519
Hey. What you doing?

00:48.521 --> 00:51.072
Oh, just taking a stroll
down memory lane.

00:51.074 --> 00:53.708
It's a photo book
that Lyndsey gave me.

00:53.710 --> 00:57.545
Oh. Here we are
at the Santa Monica Pier.

00:57.547 --> 00:59.680
"Oh, Alan,
I'm having such a great time.

00:59.682 --> 01:02.033
"I know it looks like
I'm eating cotton candy,

01:02.035 --> 01:04.902
"but really I'm just waiting
for someone better to come along

01:04.904 --> 01:06.871
so I can dump your sorry ass."

01:06.873 --> 01:09.691
That dude in the Speedo
totally photo-bombed you.

01:09.693 --> 01:12.377
Bet she was sleeping
with him, too.

01:12.379 --> 01:14.796
And look at the guy
with the churros.

01:14.798 --> 01:16.864
What's he smiling about?

01:16.866 --> 01:19.701
Okay, you know what? You
can't live in the past.

01:19.703 --> 01:21.602
You also can't
live in this robe.

01:21.604 --> 01:24.706
It's like the sacred
shroud of urine.

01:24.708 --> 01:26.591
What happened?
Lyndsey and I were supposed

01:26.593 --> 01:29.677
to take care of each other
for the rest of our lives.

01:29.679 --> 01:31.229
She'd

01:31.231 --> 01:34.232
blend my steak
so I didn't have to gum it.

01:34.234 --> 01:37.985
I'd change the tennis balls
on the bottom of her walker.

01:39.121 --> 01:41.823
We'd keep track
of each other's moles.

01:41.825 --> 01:44.225
It's a romantic picture.

01:44.227 --> 01:45.743
Glad you think so.

01:45.745 --> 01:48.062
'Cause now
that's just gonna be you and me.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.448
It's <i>not</i> gonna be you and me

01:50.450 --> 01:54.669
because A)... no.

01:54.671 --> 01:57.922
And B) you're gonna find
somebody new.

01:57.924 --> 01:59.674
You just have to have
a positive attitude.

01:59.676 --> 02:01.142
If you say you
can't, you're right.

02:01.144 --> 02:02.760
If you say you
can, you might.

02:02.762 --> 02:05.179
(blows raspberry)

02:05.181 --> 02:06.547
Do that again.

02:06.549 --> 02:08.683
(blows raspberry)
Ow!

02:08.685 --> 02:09.934
Ow!
Now, suck it up!

02:09.936 --> 02:12.186
Ow!
You're gonna find somebody new!

02:12.188 --> 02:13.471
I can't.

02:13.473 --> 02:14.806
Why not?
Look at me!

02:14.808 --> 02:15.940
(mumbles gibberish mockingly)

02:15.942 --> 02:17.975
(mumbles)
What?

02:17.977 --> 02:20.862
Look at me. When I met Lyndsey,
I was a solid six.

02:20.864 --> 02:23.147
Now I'm a soft four at best.

02:23.149 --> 02:25.783
Really? You thought
you were a six?

02:25.785 --> 02:31.489
Well, maybe not a Malibu six,
but a Wal-Mart six.

02:33.041 --> 02:34.575
And it didn't matter.
I was in love.

02:34.577 --> 02:36.443
No one takes care of themselves
when they're in love.

02:36.445 --> 02:38.329
When you know you can have sex
in a sweatshirt,

02:38.331 --> 02:39.413
you stop doing sit-ups.

02:39.415 --> 02:40.965
Well, then,
do something about it.

02:40.967 --> 02:43.534
Get yourself back in shape,
get some new clothes,

02:43.536 --> 02:45.636
get a haircut,
get your own place.

02:45.638 --> 02:48.622
Anything to get
your confidence back.

02:48.624 --> 02:51.292
Look, I appreciate the pep talk,
but I've lost all hope.

02:51.294 --> 02:52.894
Well, I can't give you hope,

02:52.896 --> 02:56.097
but I-I can give you
my American Express Black Card.

02:56.099 --> 02:58.733
Hope's for losers.

03:34.623 --> 03:36.457
(Skype ringtone plays)

03:36.459 --> 03:37.794
Oh, hey, Walden.

03:37.795 --> 03:40.178
Hey, Jake, what's going on?

03:40.180 --> 03:41.913
I was just calling my dad back.

03:41.915 --> 03:43.181
He left me a voice mail.

03:43.183 --> 03:44.816
At least, I think it was him.

03:44.818 --> 03:47.085
It was just, like, two minutes
of someone sobbing

03:47.087 --> 03:48.987
and then throwing up.

03:48.989 --> 03:51.573
Yeah, that was him.

03:51.575 --> 03:53.675
How often does he cry?

03:53.677 --> 03:56.728
It'd be quicker to tell you
how often he doesn't.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.179
He's gonna be okay, right?

03:58.181 --> 04:01.733
Yeah, he actually got dressed
today and left the house.

04:01.735 --> 04:03.819
And-and-and he even
put on deodorant.

04:03.821 --> 04:06.788
Well, I-I actually
put it on him, but he let me,

04:06.790 --> 04:09.040
so... that's progress.

04:09.042 --> 04:11.643
I'm so glad
that you're there for my dad.

04:11.645 --> 04:15.080
You're like the son
he never had.

04:15.915 --> 04:18.199
Right.

04:19.385 --> 04:21.586
Okay, so I'm gonna get going.

04:21.588 --> 04:24.589
Yeah, yeah, me, too.
I got to go run some black ops

04:24.591 --> 04:25.874
and test some ballistic weapons.

04:25.876 --> 04:28.059
Really? That...
that sounds awesome.

04:28.061 --> 04:29.728
No, I'm just messing with you.

04:29.730 --> 04:33.181
I'm gonna go get high and make,
like, 800 cupcakes.

04:34.267 --> 04:37.519
Sleep well, America.

04:37.521 --> 04:40.422
Ta-da!

04:40.424 --> 04:42.724
Wow!

04:47.096 --> 04:49.614
Wow!

04:49.616 --> 04:51.116
You look...

04:52.251 --> 04:53.952
Look at you.

04:53.954 --> 04:55.754
This is your vision, my friend.

04:55.756 --> 05:00.091
Oh, no, I could not
envision this.

05:00.093 --> 05:03.712
You were right. It's time for me
to get back to living life.

05:03.714 --> 05:05.714
Uh, check out my sweet onion.

05:05.716 --> 05:07.883
My bodacious Vidalia.

05:08.801 --> 05:12.587
Wow. How did you pack
all of you in there?

05:12.589 --> 05:16.024
Ah, well, uh, I guess
I would have to say, it's...

05:16.026 --> 05:19.728
Spanx to these.

05:19.730 --> 05:21.429
Is that a girdle?

05:21.431 --> 05:23.949
Oh, no. Uh, it's a-a male sport
control top.

05:23.951 --> 05:25.233
It's for athletes.

05:25.235 --> 05:27.769
Athletes with man boobs.

05:27.771 --> 05:29.204
Not anymore.

05:29.206 --> 05:30.489
(laughs)

05:30.491 --> 05:33.542
Uh, Heather, the salesgirl,
said I look like a "DILD."

05:33.544 --> 05:35.210
Oh?

05:35.212 --> 05:39.548
It stands for,
"dad I'd like to do."

05:39.550 --> 05:42.250
Okay. Uh, let's-let's talk
about that hair.

05:42.252 --> 05:43.668
Walk me through that.

05:43.670 --> 05:46.671
Oh, uh, a-a young man named Juan
did this to me.

05:46.673 --> 05:49.724
Um, uh,
he does Justin Bieber's hair.

05:49.726 --> 05:51.142
Oh, wow, that's lucky.

05:51.144 --> 05:54.229
I-I know. Can't believe
Justin Bieber goes to Supercuts.

05:54.231 --> 05:56.565
Um...

05:56.567 --> 05:57.799
Driving home, you can't imagine

05:57.801 --> 05:59.467
how many people
were checking me out.

05:59.469 --> 06:01.853
Oh, I <i>can</i> imagine.

06:01.855 --> 06:04.656
What do you say we go someplace
and try out my new look?

06:04.658 --> 06:07.308
I want to get my groove on
with the hip, funky people.

06:07.310 --> 06:10.579
Okay, yeah, I'll see if I can
fire up the time machine,

06:10.581 --> 06:12.414
and we'll head back to 1974.

06:12.416 --> 06:15.317
I'll, uh...
I'll put my stuff away.

06:15.319 --> 06:16.535
Uh, Alan?

06:16.537 --> 06:17.702
Yeah?

06:17.704 --> 06:19.004
My credit card?

06:19.006 --> 06:20.539
Oh, uh, right.

06:20.541 --> 06:22.707
(laughs)

06:27.013 --> 06:28.129
Release.

06:28.131 --> 06:30.298
I'm trying.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.442
(indistinct chatter)

06:40.444 --> 06:41.726
Wow.

06:41.728 --> 06:45.363
I'm seeing your hairdo
everywhere I look.

06:45.365 --> 06:48.900
Best ten bucks I ever spent.

06:49.702 --> 06:52.904
I wish I had my deck of cards.

06:52.906 --> 06:54.372
Your deck of cards?

06:54.374 --> 06:56.524
Oh, yeah. Close-up magic
is a great icebreaker

06:56.526 --> 06:58.543
with the ladies.

06:58.545 --> 07:01.713
What is wrong with you?

07:01.715 --> 07:03.915
What is wrong with you

07:03.917 --> 07:06.334
that you have a
quarter in your ear?

07:06.336 --> 07:07.802
Give me that.

07:07.804 --> 07:09.304
Come on.
You're a charming guy.

07:09.306 --> 07:12.007
Just be yourself,
stick to your strengths.

07:12.009 --> 07:13.308
I-I'm sorry. I-I can't hear you.

07:13.310 --> 07:14.926
I have a quarter in my ear.

07:14.928 --> 07:16.895
Will you stop that?

07:16.897 --> 07:19.681
What about her?
Go buy her a drink.

07:19.683 --> 07:22.734
She's a little out of
my league, isn't she?

07:22.736 --> 07:25.720
You're not even playing
in the same sport.

07:26.689 --> 07:28.907
Just go say hi.

07:28.909 --> 07:32.027
Okay, here goes.

07:32.029 --> 07:35.229
Uh, hi. Can I buy you a drink?

07:35.231 --> 07:38.750
Uh, no, thanks.
I already have one.

07:38.752 --> 07:43.338
Uh, can I reimburse you
for that one?

07:43.340 --> 07:44.756
Excuse me?

07:44.758 --> 07:47.175
Well, I would have happily
bought you a drink

07:47.177 --> 07:49.427
if I had arrived
a few moments earlier.

07:49.429 --> 07:51.880
Tell you what. Let me just
give you some cash.

07:51.882 --> 07:54.432
You're kidding, right?

07:54.434 --> 07:56.801
Uh, here's a ten.
Do you have change?

07:56.803 --> 07:59.688
What is wrong with you?

08:01.457 --> 08:03.358
Well, I'm not gonna tip you.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.277
That was weird.

08:06.279 --> 08:09.197
Yeah, she's the weird one.

08:09.199 --> 08:11.116
Maybe we should just go home.

08:11.118 --> 08:12.600
You're just a little rusty.

08:12.602 --> 08:14.619
Let me help you out.

08:16.271 --> 08:18.272
Hi.

08:18.274 --> 08:21.126
Well, hello.

08:21.128 --> 08:23.878
Yeah, before we go any
further, I should warn you

08:23.880 --> 08:27.382
that I suffered from a
horrific industrial accident

08:27.384 --> 08:29.217
down there.

08:29.219 --> 08:31.136
Oh, no.

08:31.138 --> 08:32.971
Oh, yes.

08:32.972 --> 08:35.256
Here. Say hi to
my friend Alan.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.727
How bad was the accident?

08:40.563 --> 08:42.563
Say hi.

08:42.566 --> 08:44.966
Uh, hi. Uh, I'm Alan.

08:44.968 --> 08:46.484
I'm a back doctor,

08:46.486 --> 08:49.187
but that doesn't mean
I can't check out your front.

08:49.189 --> 08:50.488
Oh, my God.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.907
(laughing):
That is hilarious!

08:52.909 --> 08:55.493
You're so funny.

08:55.495 --> 08:56.494
(laughs)

08:56.496 --> 08:58.363
Oh, my God.

08:58.365 --> 09:01.166
Um, I have a question for you.

09:01.168 --> 09:02.417
Yeah?

09:02.419 --> 09:03.651
How did you get this

09:03.653 --> 09:05.837
quarter in
your ear?

09:05.839 --> 09:07.839
How did you do that?

09:07.841 --> 09:10.825
Pull something else out of me!

09:11.844 --> 09:13.762
I like her.

09:13.764 --> 09:15.930
Oh, my God!

09:18.217 --> 09:23.021
Excuse me. How did you get
this quarter in your ear?

09:36.119 --> 09:37.952
This is quite a place.

09:37.954 --> 09:39.204
Thank you.

09:39.206 --> 09:41.589
Looks like
Elton John went on safari.

09:44.210 --> 09:47.629
Oh, uh, nice eagle.

09:47.631 --> 09:49.697
It's, uh, very realistic.

09:49.699 --> 09:52.417
I want
to feed it a bronze mouse.

09:52.419 --> 09:55.136
I can't believe
you live here all by yours...

09:55.138 --> 09:56.921
<i>Sabado Gigante.</i>

09:56.923 --> 09:58.890
(laughs)

09:58.892 --> 10:00.742
You like?

10:00.744 --> 10:02.343
Oh, yeah.

10:02.345 --> 10:05.313
The hair on my head isn't
the only thing standing up.
