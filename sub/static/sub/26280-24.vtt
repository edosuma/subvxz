Carbon.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.280
Hydrogen.

00:10.960 --> 00:11.960
Carbon.

00:14.760 --> 00:15.760
Carbon.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.634
And last but not least,

00:18.720 --> 00:19.870
carbon.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.113
This might be the glue talking,

00:23.200 --> 00:26.591
but that was a very pleasurable
139 and a half hours.

00:26.880 --> 00:27.880
Agreed.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.119
What kind of DNA is this, anyway?

00:30.200 --> 00:34.080
I was trying to design the genetic code
of an advanced race of human being.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.629
- One of my rare failures, actually.
- What went wrong?

00:36.720 --> 00:39.076
The balls kept sticking to my pants.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.394
Let's just let it dry.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.520
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.080
- Don't slam the...
- Don't slam the...

00:50.000 --> 00:51.480
That was exhilarating.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.114
- Picked up your dresses?
- Yep.

00:55.240 --> 00:57.471
The tailor had to take mine in
and let Penny's out.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.677
Best day of my life.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.199
What about the day you met me?

01:03.280 --> 01:05.158
I stand by my statement.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.958
Thank you, guys, so much for the clothes

01:08.040 --> 01:09.520
and the shoes, the plane tickets.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.829
You've been so generous.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.576
Well, it's important
that all of our friends

01:12.600 --> 01:13.954
get to share this moment with us.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.952
And then for years to come,
you can tell others

01:16.040 --> 01:17.679
you had a front-row seat to history.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.280
Although, technically, I think
your seats are in the second row.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.120
Do you want to go back to the apartment
and see me try on my dress?

01:24.320 --> 01:26.656
Shouldn't I see it for the first time
at the Nobel ceremony?

01:26.680 --> 01:28.034
It's not a wedding.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.600
Okay. Well, give me a minute

01:29.680 --> 01:31.640
to think of another reason
I don't want to see it.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.438
How about this?

01:33.440 --> 01:35.736
You can practice your acceptance speech
while I try on the dress.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.559
Ah, great. You can help me
whittle it down to 90 minutes.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.596
Was Amy suspicious
when they had to let your dress out?

01:46.680 --> 01:49.240
No. She was so happy,
she didn't even question it.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.760
Someone's gonna figure it out.
Why don't we just tell people?

01:52.800 --> 01:55.136
No, it's too early. I haven't even
wrapped my head around it.

01:55.160 --> 01:57.470
- I have. My head is wrapped.
- Yeah, well,

01:57.560 --> 02:00.280
if something else had been wrapped,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.831
Excuse me, but if I recall,

02:03.920 --> 02:05.496
you're the one
who went out drinking with Sheldon,

02:05.520 --> 02:06.760
then came home and attacked me.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.633
Attacked you?
I think, I said, "Do you wanna?"

02:09.720 --> 02:10.836
Yeah.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.480
And I was helpless.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.596
Huh-uh?

02:14.680 --> 02:15.909
So...

02:16.000 --> 02:17.229
Do you wanna?

02:18.840 --> 02:20.797
- Well, I can't get more pregnant.
- Hmm.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.234
- We'll see about that.
- Huh-uh?

02:23.440 --> 02:26.592
<i>Our whole universe
was in a hot dense state</i>

02:26.680 --> 02:29.832
<i>Then nearly fourteen billion years ago
expansion started...</i>

02:29.960 --> 02:30.838
<i>Wait!</i>

02:30.840 --> 02:31.840
<i>The earth began to cool</i>

02:31.920 --> 02:33.320
<i>The autotrophs began to drool</i>

02:33.400 --> 02:34.993
<i>Neanderthals developed tools</i>

02:35.080 --> 02:37.072
<i>We built a wall
We built the pyramids</i>

02:37.160 --> 02:39.720
<i>Math, science, history
Unraveling the mystery</i>

02:39.800 --> 02:41.314
<i>It all started with the Big Bang!</i>

02:41.400 --> 02:43.198
<i>Bang!</i>

02:49.680 --> 02:52.718
Now, Michael, Mommy and Daddy
are going away for a couple days,

02:52.880 --> 02:54.376
so if you're gonna say your first words,

02:54.400 --> 02:56.960
you got to do it now
or wait till we get back.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.796
Somebody just peed
in the big girl potty.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.951
I'm so proud!

03:05.200 --> 03:06.200
It was her, right?

03:07.160 --> 03:08.160
Yes.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.479
You still feel good about leaving them

03:10.560 --> 03:13.120
with Stuart and Denise
for a couple days?

03:13.200 --> 03:16.511
I guess. I just hope
we don't miss Michael's first words.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.193
Or Stuart's last words.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.037
You realize it's been years
since we've got away just the two of us.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.277
I know. I can't wait.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.359
Fancy hotel room. The big bed.

03:28.720 --> 03:32.031
Yeah. We're gonna sleep our asses off.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.036
You really think walking her
is gonna help me meet girls?

03:38.680 --> 03:40.034
Cinnamon is chick bait.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.798
Good. 'Cause I'm not.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.275
Just remember, you're in charge.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.794
Don't let her pull you.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.439
That seems like
an unnecessary thing to say.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.354
And please,
if you have any problems, any questions,

03:56.440 --> 03:57.874
call me immediately, okay?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.639
She's my baby.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.877
It shouldn't come up, but just in case,

04:01.960 --> 04:04.998
where could I buy a dog
that looks exactly like her?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.356
Kidding.
If she dies, I'll just tell you.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.160
Ready?

04:13.720 --> 04:14.720
Hang on.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.315
Go.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.136
"Your Majesties,
members of the Nobel Academy,

04:21.160 --> 04:22.616
when I was a young boy
growing up in East Texas,

04:22.640 --> 04:23.896
I always knew
I'd wind up on this stage.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.056
And everybody who said I wouldn't,

04:25.080 --> 04:26.776
looks pretty darn foolish right now.
I'm talking about you,

04:26.800 --> 04:28.256
high-school science teacher,
Mr. Hubert Givens..."

04:28.280 --> 04:31.239
Sheldon, Sheldon.
Why are you talking so fast?

04:31.320 --> 04:33.232
I'm trying to get my speech
down to 90 minutes.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.069
Nobody's gonna be able to understand
a word you're saying.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.435
Welcome to my life.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.913
I think you need to do some editing,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.469
like maybe cut out all that stuff
about your childhood.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.676
Are you kidding?

04:45.760 --> 04:47.752
Growing up in the backwoods
of East Texas

04:47.840 --> 04:49.399
is what makes me warm and relatable.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.432
Well, what about all these pages

04:52.560 --> 04:54.597
calling out everyone
who said you wouldn't succeed?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.117
I told them all they would rue the day.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.635
How is it gonna make me look
if the day finally comes,

04:59.720 --> 05:01.313
and they're not filled with rue?

05:02.080 --> 05:04.675
Sheldon, this isn't about ruing.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.037
This is about
humbly accepting a great honor.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.471
Amy, we won the Nobel Prize in Physics.

05:11.560 --> 05:14.120
Humility is for people
who win the goofy Nobels,

05:14.240 --> 05:16.118
like Literature, Economics and Peace.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.478
Please tell me
that's not in your speech.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.076
I can cut it,
but it's the only joke I have.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.069
All right, bagels down.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.680
Before we head to the airport,
I'd like to go over a few things.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.031
From the moment we step off the plane,

05:35.120 --> 05:37.316
each and every one of you
is an ambassador

05:37.440 --> 05:38.556
for Amy and myself.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.559
I told you these tickets weren't free.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.037
As such, your behavior
must reflect the highest standards...

05:45.120 --> 05:46.918
Raj. Bagel down.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.914
If my blood sugar drops
and I get bitchy, it's on you.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.151
- Amy, why don't you kick us off.
- Thank you.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.351
"The challenging climate of Scandinavia

05:57.440 --> 05:59.511
has left its mark on
the Swedish character.

06:00.560 --> 06:05.032
These dour, latter-day Vikings
are slow to warm up to strangers,

06:05.120 --> 06:09.558
but if you follow a few easy steps,
a Swede can be your friend for life."

06:10.080 --> 06:11.150
All right. "Number one,

06:11.240 --> 06:14.199
in Sweden,
punctuality is taken very seriously.

06:14.280 --> 06:17.114
In other words,
the loosey-goosey attitude in Helsinki

06:17.200 --> 06:18.714
will not fly in Stockholm."

06:19.480 --> 06:23.440
"Two, at the beginning and end
of all business and social meetings,

06:23.520 --> 06:26.877
shake hands with everyone present.
Men, women and children."

06:26.960 --> 06:29.429
Yes, you're all encouraged
to pair off and practice this

06:29.520 --> 06:31.637
once we're in the air
and the seat belt sign is off.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.515
Yes, Penny?

06:33.600 --> 06:35.319
Oh, do we have to go?

06:37.160 --> 06:40.198
Yes. And a reminder, Penny,
there's free alcohol in business class.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.280
Don't abuse it.

06:41.281 --> 06:42.715
Relax. I'm not gonna drink.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.599
- Why? You pregnant?
- Wha... No.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.277
No, I just, you know,
I don't like to drink when I fly.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.757
Please. I've seen you
drink in the shower.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.354
You guys have showered together?

07:01.040 --> 07:02.679
Sometimes you're just...

07:06.080 --> 07:07.594
That wasn't a no.

07:09.240 --> 07:10.336
All right, well, we should head out now

07:10.360 --> 07:12.720
if we're gonna get to the airport
six hours before boarding.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.114
Excuse me. Hello?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.954
What did we just learn about
the end of business meetings?

07:18.080 --> 07:19.355
Oh, my God.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.759
Yeah, great. Whatever.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.550
Go on. You first. Go.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.236
Wait.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.470
Help me!

07:33.560 --> 07:35.631
- Help me!
- Oh, wait. Come here.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.520
- We got this.
- Yeah, get in, get in, get in.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.520
Hang on.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.273
I've got an idea.

07:48.640 --> 07:49.835
Well done.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.072
You know, you're proving to be
an invaluable part of my entourage.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.040
Cool.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:07.480 --> 08:08.440
Yeah?

08:08.441 --> 08:10.353
- How you doing?
- Fine. Why?

08:10.520 --> 08:13.592
Well, this is the furthest
we've ever been away from the kids.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.280
I was just checking
to see if you're okay.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.710
I'm on my second <i>Jack Reacher.</i>
I'm doing great.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.075
Good. Me, too.
I was just looking at the map.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.232
Couldn't help thinking
we're here and they're there,

08:25.320 --> 08:27.630
and if anything happened,
we'd have to go here

08:27.720 --> 08:30.155
to get all the way back there.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.840
Why are you trying to freak me out?

08:32.120 --> 08:35.431
This is our vacation.
I thought we should do things together.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.440
Howie, the kids are okay.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.559
How do you know that?

08:39.640 --> 08:41.791
I just know. A mother knows.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.278
So what, now the Force is with you?

08:45.280 --> 08:46.280
Let's see.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.395
This is not the woman you want to annoy.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.792
- Howard. Howard.
- What?

08:54.080 --> 08:55.992
You see the woman sitting next to me?

08:56.800 --> 08:57.800
What about her?

08:58.760 --> 09:00.080
Is this her?

09:01.760 --> 09:03.513
Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

09:03.680 --> 09:05.319
Be cool.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.517
- No, that's not her.
- Okay.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.080
How about now?

09:15.040 --> 09:16.110
Uh-oh!

09:22.760 --> 09:24.717
That's the fourth time
she's been to the bathroom

09:24.800 --> 09:25.950
in the last two hours.

09:26.760 --> 09:27.760
So?

09:28.160 --> 09:31.119
Her breakfast was binding.
I made sure of that.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
So?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.871
So she clearly has
some sort of stomach distress.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.792
If it's viral, we're all susceptible.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.199
She's probably just airsick.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.034
Yeah, but what if she's not?
What if we get what she has?

09:43.160 --> 09:44.879
What if we infect the King of Sweden?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.394
That's how wars start.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.314
All right, that's it.
This is <i>Outbreak</i> and she's the monkey.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.515
Wait. Stop. Be reasonable.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.831
Leonard, we need to
do something about your wife.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.496
- What's the matter?
- She is clearly sick,

10:06.520 --> 10:08.096
and she's gonna
take us all down with her.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.440
She's not sick, Sheldon.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.273
She is, and I'm gonna catch it,

10:11.360 --> 10:13.176
and it's gonna ruin
the greatest day of my life.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.590
I promise
you're not going to get what she has.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.909
What's going on?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.354
Unclean! Unclean!

10:19.160 --> 10:20.160
What?

10:20.680 --> 10:21.830
He thinks you're sick.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.430
Oh!

10:23.960 --> 10:25.030
Should we tell him?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.920
Well, if we don't, he might try
and jump out of the plane.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.514
Yeah, doesn't answer my question.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.316
Tell me what?

10:33.120 --> 10:34.679
I'm pregnant, Sheldon.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.080
You're right, I can't catch that.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.834
Good news, Amy.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.400
She's just pregnant.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.555
Are you kidding me?

10:53.640 --> 10:56.599
You just found out that
a woman who has loved and cared for you

10:56.680 --> 10:59.639
for 12 years is pregnant,
and all you can say is

10:59.760 --> 11:01.720
you're relieved
that she's not gonna get you sick?

11:02.520 --> 11:05.160
There's no need for a recap.
I was there.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.556
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't tell anybody.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.518
I'm not anybody. I'm your best friend.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.673
- What's going on?
- She's pregnant.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.638
That's fantastic!

11:15.720 --> 11:17.279
Why didn't you tell me?

11:18.360 --> 11:19.635
She didn't tell me, either.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.074
But I'm her best friend.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.640
We'll get into that later.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.111
What happened to
"I'm never gonna have kids"?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.396
It was an accident.
I went out drinking with Sheldon.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.671
Oh, my gosh.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.229
We're sister wives?

11:34.160 --> 11:36.470
No. Then I went home
and slept with Leonard.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.359
- While fantasizing about...
- Leonard.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.550
And a little Idris Elba.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.599
- I mean...
- Oh, yeah.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.474
What would you like me to say?

11:45.600 --> 11:47.159
How about congratulating us?

11:47.600 --> 11:50.798
Are congratulations even in order?
I didn't think Penny wanted children.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.520
Well, she didn't, now she does.
And just so you know,

11:53.600 --> 11:56.240
we weren't gonna tell anybody
so we wouldn't upstage your big day.

11:56.360 --> 11:59.831
Oh, please, you couldn't upstage us.
We won a Nobel Prize.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.593
Any idiot can have a baby.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.440
Hey. What's going on?

12:03.520 --> 12:04.636
Case in point.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.877
You are a selfish jerk.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.553
To hell with you and your Nobel Prize.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.074
I found her boarding pass in her purse.
It's totally her.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.034
Hi, Stuart, just checking in.
Seeing if everything's okay.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.556
<i>Oh, yeah, we're having fun.</i>

12:26.320 --> 12:29.438
<i>Me, Halley and Denise
played hide-and-seek all day.</i>

12:29.560 --> 12:31.756
- Oh, that's nice.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

12:31.840 --> 12:34.036
<i>I found Denise right away.</i>

12:36.080 --> 12:37.480
Where was Halley hiding?

12:38.680 --> 12:41.070
<i>Uh, the important thing is
she's not there now.</i>

12:42.120 --> 12:44.032
Okay, so, everyone's happy and healthy?

12:44.120 --> 12:46.635
<i>- Well, that depends.</i>
- What's that mean?

12:47.760 --> 12:50.480
<i>How many teeth
did Halley have when you left?</i>

12:51.680 --> 12:52.875
All of them.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.834
<i>Oh, yeah, that's what I was afraid of.</i>

12:57.440 --> 12:58.440
What happened?

12:58.520 --> 13:00.113
<i>Ah, well, all right.</i>

13:00.280 --> 13:03.273
<i>Um, Michael had
a little fever last night.</i>

13:03.360 --> 13:04.360
Michael had a fever?

13:04.440 --> 13:06.591
<i>Do you want to hear about Halley or not?</i>

13:06.720 --> 13:08.074
What happened, Stuart?

13:08.160 --> 13:10.994
<i>He was running a little fever,
nothing to worry about.</i>

13:11.080 --> 13:15.120
<i>And Halley, bless her heart,
wanted to bring him his boo-boo bear,</i>

13:15.200 --> 13:17.317
<i>so she climbed over the safety rail</i>

13:17.440 --> 13:20.433
<i>and took a little tumble
down the stairs.</i>

13:21.720 --> 13:23.313
She fell down the stairs?

13:23.400 --> 13:28.031
<i>She rolled down the stairs,
laughing the whole time.</i>

13:28.720 --> 13:32.157
<i>Anyway, when she got to the bottom,
there was a tooth missing.</i>

13:32.280 --> 13:33.475
Stuart!

13:33.560 --> 13:35.597
<i>She's fine! She thought it was funny.</i>

13:37.280 --> 13:39.431
Did you at least
save it for the tooth fairy?

13:39.520 --> 13:41.432
<i>No, we couldn't find it.</i>

13:41.520 --> 13:43.671
<i>We have a theory about where it is,</i>

13:43.800 --> 13:46.952
<i>but it'll take
six to eight hours to confirm.</i>

13:49.160 --> 13:50.160
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

13:50.200 --> 13:52.669
<i>where do you keep
the spaghetti strainer?</i>

13:56.880 --> 13:58.056
Come on,
you didn't seriously expect him

13:58.080 --> 13:59.878
to react like a normal human being.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.679
No, but still,

14:01.760 --> 14:05.117
after all these years,
after all the crap I've put up with,

14:05.240 --> 14:08.551
you'd think, just this once,
he'd care about someone else's feelings.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.393
- Oh, my God!
- What?

14:10.480 --> 14:12.870
Pickled herring.
Who knew how good it was!

14:12.960 --> 14:14.440
Really?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.751
Sounds gross. Looks gross. Smells gross.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.112
It's delicious!

14:21.480 --> 14:23.915
Ooh, that might be my salted cod!

14:26.520 --> 14:27.520
What?

14:27.521 --> 14:29.751
Sheldon has something he'd like to say.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.071
I'm sorry I didn't react appropriately.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.277
You and Penny
are bringing new life into the world.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.511
Congratulations.
I can't wait to meet it.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.990
- "It"?
- That's a gender-neutral pronoun.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.515
If you're offended,
take it up with the English language.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.831
Oh, good, you're here. Listen,

14:45.040 --> 14:48.317
we're thinking
maybe we should go back to L.A.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.715
- Why?
- We just can't

14:49.800 --> 14:51.200
be this far away from the kids.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.352
Bernie's having a meltdown,
and, frankly, so am I.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.909
Yeah, well, pull it together.
This is a big day for me.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.316
Yeah, I wasn't sure what to do.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.879
Now I am. We're going home.

15:04.960 --> 15:05.996
We'll join you.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.280
Wait. Do I get a vote in this?

15:07.360 --> 15:08.776
They'll have pickled herring
on the plane.

15:08.800 --> 15:09.916
Bye-bye.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.594
Well, I hate to say it,

15:14.680 --> 15:17.593
but I think everyone
is being incredibly selfish.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.949
Well, you would be
the authority on the subject.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.400
What does that mean?

15:25.440 --> 15:29.400
Sheldon, no one is happier than I am
to win the Nobel.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.039
But it's not more important
than our friends.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.111
How can you call them friends
when they're abandoning us?

15:37.560 --> 15:41.076
They're abandoning us
because you broke their hearts.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.237
- I didn't mean to.
- I know!

15:47.360 --> 15:49.158
You never mean to.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.234
That's the only reason
people tolerate you!

15:55.280 --> 15:56.873
Does that include you?

15:59.560 --> 16:00.880
Sometimes, yeah.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.070
Okay, that's it for the fish.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.637
We'll be back with the meatballs
after a short word from our sponsor.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.155
Oh, thank you.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.591
Leonard, I can't go home.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.111
- I have to be there for Amy.
- Yeah.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.157
I was thinking that, too.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.950
As angry as I am at Sheldon,
I still want to see him win that medal.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.633
Hmm, it's so strange.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.077
No matter
how thoughtless and selfish he is,

16:39.800 --> 16:41.393
I still love him.

16:41.520 --> 16:45.116
If you think about it,
he has kind of been our practice kid.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.393
Like when you make pancakes

16:48.480 --> 16:50.676
and the first one
comes out a little wonky.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.077
The university prefers "quirky."

16:59.200 --> 17:01.431
Hello. Hey. It's Howard.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.273
Oh, us, too.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.238
- Wait, what?
- They're gonna stay.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.835
The kids are fine.
Bernie's parents took over.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.596
Really?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.638
Oh, poor little guy.

17:12.760 --> 17:13.876
Is Michael okay?

17:13.960 --> 17:14.996
Yeah, it's Stuart.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.760
Bernie's dad gave him a hug,
cracked a rib.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.279
Yeah. Okay, we'll meet you in the lobby.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.640
How long is it gonna take you
to get ready?

17:27.839 --> 17:29.957
I just need, like, five or ten minutes.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.953
- Really?
- No. What is wrong with you?

17:36.400 --> 17:38.278
And in the field of physics,

17:38.360 --> 17:42.274
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler
and Dr. Sheldon Cooper

17:42.360 --> 17:45.398
for their discovery of super-asymmetry.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.877
Just to be clear, this isn't a date.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.360
Yeah, I know.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.759
Then why are you holding my hand?

18:06.120 --> 18:07.839
Thank you, Your Majesties.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.480
Thank you to the Nobel Committee.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.151
We are deeply honored.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.591
I would just like to take this moment

18:16.680 --> 18:19.320
to say to all the young girls out there

18:19.400 --> 18:22.393
who dream about science
as a profession...

18:22.480 --> 18:23.675
Go for it.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.838
It is the greatest job in the world.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.679
And if anybody tells you you can't,
don't listen.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.833
And now,

18:37.920 --> 18:39.513
speaking of not listening,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.037
my husband, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.640
Sheldon.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.234
What? Did you finish... Great job.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.474
Thank you, Dr. Fowler.

18:56.320 --> 19:00.712
I have a very long
and somewhat self-centered speech here.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.957
But I'd like to set it aside.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.434
- Yeah!
- Way to go!

19:11.000 --> 19:13.959
Because this honor
doesn't just belong to me.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.070
I wouldn't be up here

19:17.160 --> 19:20.551
if it weren't for some
very important people in my life.

19:21.440 --> 19:25.878
Beginning with my mother,
father, Meemaw,

19:26.640 --> 19:28.313
brother and sister.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.714
And my other family,

19:32.800 --> 19:35.235
who I'm so happy to have here with us.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.797
Is that Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

19:45.720 --> 19:50.795
I was under a misapprehension
that my accomplishments were mine alone.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.517
Nothing could be further from the truth.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.354
I have been encouraged, sustained,

20:02.040 --> 20:05.511
inspired and tolerated,

20:05.640 --> 20:07.154
not only by my wife,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.314
but by the greatest group
of friends anyone ever had.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.792
I'd like to ask them to stand.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.678
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.310
Dr. Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.716
Astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.835
And my two dearest friends in the world,

20:42.840 --> 20:43.910
Penny Hofstadter

20:49.600 --> 20:51.557
and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.600
I was there the moment
Leonard and Penny met.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.110
He said to me that their babies
would be smart and beautiful.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.760
And now that they're expecting,

21:06.840 --> 21:09.309
I have no doubt
that that will be the case.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.320
Thanks, Sheldon.

21:10.321 --> 21:12.391
I haven't told my parents yet,
but thanks.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.954
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.595
Don't tell anyone that last thing.
That's a secret.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.120
Howard, Bernadette,

21:26.160 --> 21:29.471
Raj, Penny, Leonard,

21:30.080 --> 21:33.437
I apologize if I haven't been
the friend you deserve.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.516
But I want you to know,

21:38.000 --> 21:39.229
in my way,

21:41.480 --> 21:42.675
I love you all.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.354
And I love you.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.320
Thank you.

22:05.920 --> 22:10.437
<i>Our whole universe
was in a hot dense state</i>

22:10.520 --> 22:15.231
<i>Then nearly fourteen billion years ago
expansion started...</i>

22:15.320 --> 22:16.674
<i>Wait!</i>

22:17.080 --> 22:19.151
<i>The earth began to cool</i>

22:19.240 --> 22:21.118
<i>The autotrophs began to drool</i>

22:21.200 --> 22:23.840
<i>Neanderthals developed tools</i>

22:23.920 --> 22:27.470
<i>We built a wall
We built the pyramids</i>

22:27.560 --> 22:32.919
<i>Math, science, history
Unraveling the mystery</i>

22:33.000 --> 22:37.040
<i>That all started with the Big Bang!</i>
