[serene music]

00:12.534 --> 00:13.491
- There you are.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.450
- Oh, thank you.
- Great.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.191
Can I get you anything else?

00:18.366 --> 00:19.497
- No. All set.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.498
- Okay.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.152
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:22.196 --> 00:25.416
What is the pink stuff
next to the hummus?

00:25.460 --> 00:28.289
- It's called lift.
Pickled turnips.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.725
It tastes better
than it sounds...

00:29.768 --> 00:32.249
and looks.
Promise.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.295
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.124
- To buying
our first apartment.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.213
- I can't believe we did it.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.650
It's sort of insane.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.173
But in a good way.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.175
- Cheers.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.177
- Everyone, get out!
Now!

[sirens squawking]

01:20.645 --> 01:22.734
- Bomb went off at 12:55.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.606
One dead.
Five injured.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.784
- I had dinner
on my 10th birthday here.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.307
- You grew up here?

01:30.351 --> 01:31.526
- Yeah.
Five blocks north.

28th and Steinway.

[indistinct radio chatter]

01:36.444 --> 01:38.446
This place was the hub.

01:40.230 --> 01:43.233
The center
of the whole community.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.849
What else do we know
about the bombing?

01:50.893 --> 01:52.286
- Not much.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.114
A witness said
someone yelled,

01:54.157 --> 01:56.159
"Everyone, get out!
Bomb!"

01:56.203 --> 01:59.206
And ERT is looking
for remnants of the IED.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.560
- Looks like NYPD's
running point.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.866
Hate Crimes is all over
the scene talking to witnesses.

02:07.910 --> 02:11.174
- Think you got some bad intel,
detective.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.741
NYPD will be supporting us.

02:12.784 --> 02:16.136
I just hung up with the mayor
and police commissioner.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.485
SAC Isobel Castille.

02:17.528 --> 02:18.747
- Nice to meet you.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.618
- Let's dig in.

02:20.662 --> 02:24.231
I'd love to have a suspect
in custody by end of the day.

02:25.449 --> 02:28.452
- All right, people, listen up.
We got one dead, five injured.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.150
Name of the restaurant
is Samra's,

02:30.193 --> 02:31.629
located in the heart
of Little Egypt,

02:31.673 --> 02:33.762
Astoria, Queens.
Best baba ganoush in the city.

02:33.805 --> 02:36.460
Question number one,
is this political or personal?

02:36.504 --> 02:38.375
Is it about the owner or
someone else in the restaurant?

02:38.419 --> 02:40.638
Or is someone trying
to make a statement?

02:40.682 --> 02:42.292
Ann, let's get the names
of all the active

02:42.336 --> 02:43.772
white supremacy groups
in the area.

02:43.815 --> 02:47.210
Mary, pull up
any interesting chatter,

02:47.254 --> 02:48.907
anyone talking smack,

02:48.951 --> 02:51.258
puffing out
his or her digital chest.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.390
Sara, you want to dig into
the owner of the restaurant,

02:53.434 --> 02:54.652
his financials,
his family life?

02:54.696 --> 02:56.350
Let's go, people.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.700
Let's hit the phones,
the screens, the wires.

02:58.743 --> 03:01.224
We need answers fast.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.880
- Nails, razors, ball bearings.
I'm shocked it was so potent.

03:04.923 --> 03:08.666
This is really just a crude,
unsophisticated, lethal mess.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.582
- If she's also
an Instagram model from Atlanta

03:11.626 --> 03:14.716
with a turtle tattoo
at the nape of her neck,

03:14.759 --> 03:18.502
then you literally just
described my ex-girlfriend.

03:19.982 --> 03:22.419
- Thanks for the intel.

03:22.463 --> 03:25.422
- Stuart Scola.
Your new partner.

03:26.815 --> 03:28.208
- Oh, great,
you two have already met.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.252
Stuart, what's up?
Good to see you.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.819
- Yeah, good to see you, too.

03:30.862 --> 03:33.300
- Stuart and I crossed paths
on a case up in Boston,

03:33.343 --> 03:35.563
what, five years ago?
- Appreciate the call.

03:35.606 --> 03:38.348
You know, been looking to get
back to New York for a while.

03:38.392 --> 03:39.915
- Glad it worked out.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.700
Now this...

03:42.744 --> 03:44.702
This is for you.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.313
- Oh, wow.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.357
It's really official.

03:47.401 --> 03:48.445
- Mm-hmm.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.273
And celebration complete.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.535
We need you in Astoria.

03:51.579 --> 03:52.710
Boots on the ground
of the crime scene.

03:52.754 --> 03:53.755
Yeah?
- Okay.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.585
- Hey, Kris.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.456
You know, now that
you're an actual agent,

03:59.500 --> 04:01.763
you should probably
bring your gun.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.854
- Yeah.

04:14.776 --> 04:18.388
- I don't know what this world
is coming to, Omar.

04:18.432 --> 04:22.305
I've been in business 32 years,
before you were even born,

04:22.349 --> 04:24.829
and now,
I don't even know what to say.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.744
- What about
your personal life?

04:26.788 --> 04:28.355
You have any issues
or problems that have come up?

04:28.398 --> 04:30.618
- No, my life is simple.

04:30.661 --> 04:35.318
I go to work, go home, sleep,
then do it all over again.

04:35.362 --> 04:38.539
- Did you hear a man yell
something before the explosion?

04:38.582 --> 04:39.975
- Yes, one of the waiters.

04:40.018 --> 04:42.934
He screamed
for everyone to get out.

04:42.978 --> 04:46.764
He must've seen something.
His name is Joseph Nasser.

04:47.591 --> 04:48.897
[speaking Arabic]

04:50.594 --> 04:52.030
[speaking Arabic]

04:53.641 --> 04:56.644
- Mr. Samra, if you need
anything, anything...

04:58.602 --> 04:59.995
Please.
Call me.

05:01.649 --> 05:04.304
- I appreciate that, Omar.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.306
We're all very proud of you.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.829
Your father would be, too.

05:07.872 --> 05:09.700
He always said you would be...

05:09.744 --> 05:11.615
a big deal some day.

05:11.659 --> 05:14.618
[dramatic music]

05:14.662 --> 05:18.753
â™ª

05:18.796 --> 05:20.885
- Joseph,
I'm Special Agent Maggie Bell.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.452
This is Special Agent Zidan.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.367
- Uh, yeah, hi.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.326
Can you tell us
what you saw before

05:26.369 --> 05:27.718
you yelled for everyone
to get out?

05:27.762 --> 05:29.807
- I was headed for the kitchen,

05:29.851 --> 05:33.898
and I saw this kid, about 20,

05:33.942 --> 05:36.510
out of the corner of my eye,
just looking around.

05:36.553 --> 05:37.989
He dropped something
on the floor,

05:38.033 --> 05:40.383
and hurried out,
and I looked

05:40.427 --> 05:42.907
and saw a backpack
on the floor.

05:42.951 --> 05:46.824
And then I started
yelling for people to get out.

05:46.868 --> 05:47.869
- Why did you think
it was a bomb?

05:47.912 --> 05:49.523
- Just a feeling.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.003
- Did you get
a good look at this kid?

05:52.047 --> 05:55.485
- White, around six feet tall.

05:55.529 --> 05:59.054
And when he ran out,
he jumped into a pickup truck.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.883
I think it was black.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.885
- If you think
of anything else.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.019
- Hopefully one of
these cameras has video

06:08.063 --> 06:10.021
of that black pickup truck.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.459
- Yeah, let's hope.

06:14.025 --> 06:17.028
- Your building has several
security cameras facing south.

06:17.072 --> 06:19.596
We'd love to review that video.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.076
- You got a search warrant?

06:21.119 --> 06:22.686
- We can certainly get one,

06:22.730 --> 06:24.819
but we'd rather not waste
all that time.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.864
- Right, 'cause the FBI
cares so much about Muslims.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.736
- Excuse me?

06:28.779 --> 06:31.042
- You spend half your time
hiding out in our communities,

06:31.086 --> 06:32.522
trying to entrap us,
turn us into

06:32.566 --> 06:33.915
these evil terrorists you think
we really are.

06:33.958 --> 06:34.916
- Look, we're just trying
to help here.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.483
- Help?

06:36.526 --> 06:38.485
Help out by how,
by kicking down our doors?

06:38.528 --> 06:40.051
Or spying on our mosques?

06:40.095 --> 06:42.750
You harass and belittle us
for no reason whatsoever.

06:42.793 --> 06:43.925
- I gotta disagree with you

06:43.968 --> 06:46.057
on the no reason
whatsoever thing.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.798
I mean, let's face it.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.409
There's a reason
that our scrutiny

06:49.452 --> 06:51.062
of this community
has increased.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.456
- Oh, here we go again
with this 9/11 talk.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.023
Those men were terrorists.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.590
They don't speak
for real Muslims.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.809
- And anyone on this earth
with half a brain

06:58.853 --> 07:00.158
knows that to be true.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.727
See, what I'm saying
is it happened.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.729
And I know it happened, man.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.775
Because my brother
died that day.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.692
He was having breakfast
on the top floor,

07:11.735 --> 07:15.435
selling muni bonds to some guy
from London named Howard Betts.

07:17.567 --> 07:18.699
- I'm sorry to hear that.

07:18.742 --> 07:21.571
- Look, sir,
all we want to do

07:21.615 --> 07:24.139
is nail the dude
who blew up that restaurant

07:24.182 --> 07:26.184
and killed that young woman.

07:27.011 --> 07:32.147
So we'd really love
to see that surveillance video.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.543
- Okay.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.588
Come with me.

07:41.591 --> 07:44.115
- Hey...I'm sorry
about your brother.

07:44.159 --> 07:46.466
- Don't be.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.468
Made it up.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.646
- Okay.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.567
- So the black pickup that we
saw on the surveillance video

08:00.610 --> 08:03.221
right here comes back
to this house four doors down.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.484
- Owner is Maureen Murphy.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.007
She's 46, white.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.530
She has one son, Justin.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.967
He's 22 and 5'11".

08:10.011 --> 08:11.752
- That matches the description
the waiter gave us.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.231
- Yeah.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.842
Okay, let's call for backup.

08:14.885 --> 08:15.930
- No.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.627
[tense music]

08:17.671 --> 08:19.977
Let's hit it now.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.545
â™ª

08:22.589 --> 08:24.982
- Okay.
Let's hit it now.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.944
- FBI!

08:29.987 --> 08:31.206
- Don't move!

08:35.906 --> 08:38.996
[both grunting]

08:39.040 --> 08:40.041
- [groans]

08:42.173 --> 08:44.785
[grunting]

08:51.574 --> 08:53.271
[both panting]

08:53.315 --> 08:54.795
- Justin Murphy,
you're under arrest.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.144
- For what?

08:56.187 --> 08:58.668
- For blowing up
my favorite restaurant.

08:58.712 --> 09:01.584
And for killing
an ER nurse named Victoria.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.891
- [laughs]

09:03.934 --> 09:05.022
Yeah.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.599
- One dead,
five injured.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.688
So you are staring
at a life sentence or worse.

09:18.732 --> 09:22.126
- Worse?
What's that mean?

09:22.170 --> 09:23.171
- Death.

09:23.214 --> 09:24.912
- Well, that ain't so bad.

09:24.955 --> 09:27.305
- Well, if it ain't so bad,
then why didn't you strap

09:27.349 --> 09:30.918
that bomb to your chest
and go out like a hero?

09:30.961 --> 09:34.312
- Because white folk
are too smart for that.

09:34.356 --> 09:37.098
Only crazy Arabs
do crap like that.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.322
- So you admit to the bombing?

09:44.366 --> 09:46.890
- I didn't admit to nothing...

09:46.934 --> 09:49.719
except for hating
bible-thumping Muslims.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.728
- If you're gonna hate someone,

09:58.772 --> 10:02.036
you should probably know
who you're actually hating.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.342
Muslims don't read
the Bible, Justin.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.084
You're right.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.782
I'm not here
to give you a tutorial.

10:08.825 --> 10:12.699
I am here to give you
your last chance.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.702
[dramatic music]

10:15.745 --> 10:20.881
â™ª

10:20.924 --> 10:22.752
- [laughs]

10:22.796 --> 10:25.712
What's that?

10:25.755 --> 10:28.758
- That is the thing
that proves you're guilty.

10:28.802 --> 10:32.675
It's a series of stupid
hate-filled texts

10:32.719 --> 10:34.285
about Muslims.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.374
"Whites don't matter anymore.

10:36.418 --> 10:39.203
"We gotta take
back what is ours.

10:39.247 --> 10:45.296
I can't wait to make Muslim
pigs pay for their sins."

10:45.340 --> 10:47.385
- There ain't no law about
saying things like that.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.952
- No, there isn't,
but there are a few

10:48.996 --> 10:50.693
against blowing up restaurants.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.654
We have you on surveillance
tape leaving the restaurant

10:54.697 --> 10:56.656
in your black pickup truck.

10:56.699 --> 10:59.049
And we also have your prints
on the backpack

10:59.093 --> 11:00.921
and the door of the restaurant.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.752
We know it's you, Justin.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.066
- Okay.

11:18.025 --> 11:21.028
Then...what should I do?

11:21.071 --> 11:22.812
- Tell me everything you know.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.859
Did you do this
with anyone else?

11:27.948 --> 11:30.690
- Yeah.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.257
Some guy named...

11:33.301 --> 11:36.304
Bill.
I don't know his last name.

11:36.347 --> 11:39.873
I met him online
in a chat room.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.265
He said he'd give me a bomb
and three grand

11:41.309 --> 11:43.964
to blow up
that Syrian restaurant.

11:48.882 --> 11:51.798
- We tracked Justin's emails
to an ISP address

11:51.841 --> 11:53.756
belonging to an Elliot White.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.846
He's 47, single, no kids.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.761
I mean, obviously
he gave Justin a fake name.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.023
- Any priors?

12:00.067 --> 12:02.243
- No, and no digital footprint,
either.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.766
- All right,
find Maggie and OA.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.812
Tell them we have
a suspect and an address.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.161
- Okay.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.731
- FBI!

12:12.470 --> 12:19.477
â™ª

12:23.525 --> 12:25.005
- Hands over your head.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.097
Get up.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.883
Elliot White,
you are under arrest.

12:36.451 --> 12:43.458
â™ª

13:08.875 --> 13:10.528
- Suspect's name
is Michael Moosa.

13:10.572 --> 13:14.794
He's 45, CPA,
divorced, no priors.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.143
- But he rents
Elliot White's house?

13:16.186 --> 13:18.058
- Yes, I spoke to Mr. White,

13:18.101 --> 13:20.277
and he said he rented the house
to Moosa seven months ago.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.845
- And Moosa is Muslim?

13:22.889 --> 13:25.413
- Based on what I saw
in his apartment, yeah.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.502
- So why would a Muslim
bomb a restaurant

13:27.545 --> 13:29.330
frequented by Muslims?

13:29.373 --> 13:30.548
Got some sort of vendetta
against the owner?

13:30.592 --> 13:32.072
- Doesn't look that way.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.334
So far, we haven't
been able to find

13:33.377 --> 13:35.379
any direct
or indirect connections.

13:35.423 --> 13:38.556
- So keep digging.
There's got to be a reason.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.255
- Hey, hold on.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.300
I think I just found something.

13:47.391 --> 13:50.394
- You filed this police report
10 months ago.

13:53.136 --> 13:57.227
Because three white punks
beat you to a pulp?

14:00.317 --> 14:02.624
They put you in a coma.

14:04.408 --> 14:07.977
I mean, it says here that
they mocked your ethnicity.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.413
They mocked your religion.

14:09.457 --> 14:12.503
- Those animals
tried to kill me.

14:12.547 --> 14:15.158
For no reason.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.595
They just kept kicking
and punching me.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.642
- That sounds awful.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.907
And I can't imagine
what that would've been like.

14:24.951 --> 14:28.998
Or how much anger
you might have.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.913
But rather than let it go,

14:30.957 --> 14:32.915
you attacked your own people,

14:32.959 --> 14:36.179
and then blamed it
on some white idiot.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.442
Justin.

14:40.227 --> 14:44.535
- You wanted the world to know
how bad it really is...

14:44.579 --> 14:47.234
for people like you and me.

14:47.277 --> 14:50.237
So you raised a false flag.

14:52.108 --> 14:56.243
The problem is someone died.

14:59.376 --> 15:01.901
What you did was wrong.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.905
So, Moosa, please...

15:06.993 --> 15:11.127
Please tell me what happened.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.567
- I told Justin
to detonate the bomb

15:16.611 --> 15:18.395
when the restaurant was closed.

15:20.223 --> 15:24.053
I said 1:00 a.m.,
not 1:00 p.m.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.360
I was trying to make
the police take notice

15:26.403 --> 15:27.970
so they would reopen my case

15:28.014 --> 15:31.017
and find the animals
who tried to kill me.

15:35.282 --> 15:38.154
I didn't mean
for anyone to die.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.156
I swear.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.159
[somber music]

15:43.203 --> 15:49.252
â™ª

15:49.296 --> 15:51.037
- Time to ring the bell.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.388
- Yeah, I'm just not sure
what that's gonna sound like.

15:54.431 --> 15:57.521
Hate crime perpetrated
against Muslims by a Muslim.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.610
Too much nuance for a society

15:59.654 --> 16:02.570
obsessed with
treatable headlines.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.615
- Yeah, so I guess I'm gonna
have to dumb it down.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.443
Make it more palatable.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.273
- Justin Murphy
and Michael Moosa

16:10.317 --> 16:12.014
were arrested today
in connection

16:12.058 --> 16:15.061
with a violent attack
on the Muslim community.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.150
They have been charged
with murder,

16:17.193 --> 16:19.195
conspiracy to violate
civil rights,

16:19.239 --> 16:22.720
and violent crime
in aid of racketeering.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.114
Racially motivated crimes
such as these

16:25.158 --> 16:27.160
are antithetical
to American values

16:27.203 --> 16:29.379
and they will be
investigated swiftly,

16:29.423 --> 16:31.991
thoroughly,
and without mercy.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.429
Thank you.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.605
- Is that it?

16:37.648 --> 16:39.737
I'm sorry.
What the hell was that?

16:39.781 --> 16:41.348
She didn't even mention
that he was Muslim

16:41.391 --> 16:43.132
or he was behind the attack.

16:43.176 --> 16:46.353
- Well, sometimes when
the truth is too complicated,

16:46.396 --> 16:47.658
it can be best to simplify it.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.443
Bad guys blow up
a Muslim restaurant,

16:49.486 --> 16:50.574
FBI sweeps in,

16:50.618 --> 16:51.749
makes the arrest
within 24 hours.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.316
Clean and simple.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.014
Win for the Bureau,
win for the Muslims.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.494
- The people in that community
should know

16:57.538 --> 16:59.757
what really happened and why.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.455
- Maybe.

17:01.498 --> 17:04.284
But then again,
maybe it's better they don't,

17:04.327 --> 17:07.635
that they think the FBI
had their back this time.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.245
- So you agree with Isobel?

17:09.289 --> 17:11.552
- Yeah, I think she made
the right move.

17:16.383 --> 17:18.037
- I mean, yeah, yeah,
this is...

17:18.080 --> 17:20.082
[phone rings]

17:20.126 --> 17:22.084
- The waiter Joseph.
He wants to talk.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.043
He says it's important.

17:25.566 --> 17:28.525
[dramatic music]

17:28.569 --> 17:35.576
â™ª

17:38.753 --> 17:40.711
- Joseph.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.366
What's going on?

17:43.410 --> 17:45.455
- You mind if we walk?

17:45.499 --> 17:47.109
- Yeah, sure.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.154
- Okay.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.245
Thanks for meeting me.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.727
Appreciate it.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.468
- Of course,
but you should know

17:58.512 --> 18:01.558
that we already caught the guy
responsible for the bombing.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.821
- Yeah, I heard.
That's great.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.391
- Okay, what's going on?

18:08.435 --> 18:09.784
Your eyes are darting
back and forth.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.308
Your luscious Arabic accent
has disappeared.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.831
Can we cut to the chase?

18:13.875 --> 18:16.617
- I have intel
on a possible terror attack.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.836
Two guys I know
from the neighborhood

18:18.880 --> 18:21.143
are looking to get revenge
for the restaurant bombing.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.102
- And these guys
from the neighborhood

18:23.145 --> 18:24.407
just came up and told you

18:24.451 --> 18:26.757
about a probable
terrorist attack?

18:26.801 --> 18:29.499
- No, not exactly.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.893
I'm FBI.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.682
Sorry I didn't tell you before.

18:38.726 --> 18:41.207
I didn't want to compromise
my operation.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.605
- Okay.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.694
Joseph,
if that is your real name--

18:50.738 --> 18:52.131
- It is.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.393
- So what's going on?

18:53.436 --> 18:55.438
Are you working
with the Joint Task Force?

18:55.482 --> 18:57.397
- No, CTD is flying
solo on this,

18:57.440 --> 19:00.574
so that's why I needed you.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.750
- Need me for what?

19:02.793 --> 19:04.534
- To help close the deal
with these kids.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.798
- What kind of commitment
are we talking about?

19:07.842 --> 19:09.496
- Just a few meetings.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.324
I'll introduce you
as my cousin with connections

19:11.367 --> 19:13.282
to Al-Qaeda in Kabul.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.284
Things go as planned,
you'll be back at 26 Fed

19:15.328 --> 19:16.546
in a day or two.

19:23.249 --> 19:26.208
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:26.252 --> 19:32.867
â™ª

19:39.221 --> 19:41.310
- Ma'am?
- Yes.

19:41.354 --> 19:45.836
- I spoke to Special Agent
Nasser from CTD...

19:45.880 --> 19:47.316
and he wants me to help him--

19:47.360 --> 19:49.449
- I know.
His supervisor just called.

19:49.492 --> 19:52.191
I told him
you'd be glad to assist.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.497
Have Kristen dig
into the suspects' backgrounds,

19:54.541 --> 19:55.890
and bring Maggie
and Scola for backup.

20:02.331 --> 20:04.768
- Ma'am.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.554
If I may...

20:07.597 --> 20:09.643
Why didn't you make it
more clear that a Muslim

20:09.686 --> 20:13.255
was responsible
for the restaurant attack?

20:13.299 --> 20:17.216
I just figured that if people
knew who was behind the attack,

20:17.259 --> 20:20.610
that it might alleviate
some of this fear...

20:20.654 --> 20:22.308
in the community.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.748
- I know that you
went to West Point.

20:29.663 --> 20:32.492
And that you
were an Army Ranger.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.276
What I didn't know till now,

20:34.320 --> 20:38.280
of course, is that you're
a public relations expert.

20:38.324 --> 20:41.283
[dramatic music]

20:41.327 --> 20:48.334
â™ª

20:59.606 --> 21:01.608
- My bros.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.958
You made it.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.266
- Good to see you, brother.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.356
- This is my cousin Omar,

21:10.399 --> 21:12.314
the one I been
telling you about.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.795
- So Joseph tells me
you want to be

21:14.838 --> 21:16.971
a part of something
exciting and important.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.581
- We are.

21:18.625 --> 21:22.368
- Being part of a family
always makes sense...

21:22.411 --> 21:24.283
especially when that family

21:24.326 --> 21:27.721
is trying to help save
the Muslim people from ruin.

21:27.764 --> 21:30.332
What happened the other
day at my restaurant,

21:30.376 --> 21:33.292
at the place I work...

21:33.335 --> 21:34.423
is a wake-up call.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.425
The whole world needs to know

21:36.469 --> 21:38.601
that white Americans
cannot intimidate us,

21:38.645 --> 21:40.342
that when they hit us,

21:40.386 --> 21:43.911
we hit back even harder.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.826
- What's in it for us, man?

21:45.869 --> 21:48.655
- Honor.
And pride.

21:48.698 --> 21:51.353
- Yeah, well, honor and pride
don't pay the bills.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.747
- He don't mean
no disrespect, sir.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.531
It's just that me and him,
we're broke.

21:55.575 --> 21:56.837
I live with my sister,

21:56.880 --> 21:59.361
Rhami lives
in someone's basement,

21:59.405 --> 22:00.623
so, you know,
we're just wondering

22:00.667 --> 22:02.321
if there's any money
to be made.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.323
- That's perfectly
understandable.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.456
Listen, after the bombing,

22:07.500 --> 22:10.067
Omar will take you
to a town outside of Kabul.

22:10.111 --> 22:14.028
He will find you a job.
He will find you a home.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.335
He will find you a wife.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.337
- That sounds cool...

22:18.380 --> 22:19.773
especially that wife part.

22:21.775 --> 22:25.344
- Oh, yeah, the women in Kabul,
they're beautiful.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.997
- And they like Americans?

22:27.041 --> 22:28.869
- Oh, they love Americans.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.917
- What about the cash, man?

22:33.961 --> 22:36.485
- That's not usually
how we do this.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.400
- Yeah, well,
we know another dude.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.402
He's an imam in Brooklyn.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.012
Said he'd give us
10 grand for a bombing,

22:42.056 --> 22:43.927
plus a house in Toronto
rent free for two years.

22:43.971 --> 22:46.016
- Okay, we need to jump
on this imam thing.

22:49.672 --> 22:50.630
- And he's ready to roll.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.414
Like, soon.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.850
- You know, it sounds to me
like your imam friend

22:53.894 --> 22:55.504
is a cop or FBI.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.376
- Why do you say that?

22:57.419 --> 22:59.856
- Because when a deal
is too good to be true, it is.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.858
- Is that good or bad?

23:01.902 --> 23:04.557
- Brothers, he's lying to you.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.950
- Nah, I've known
this imam for a while.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.648
All right, he's legit.

23:08.691 --> 23:09.953
Has lots of money, too.

23:11.433 --> 23:12.826
- Okay.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.393
It's your call.

23:14.436 --> 23:17.047
But either way,
we go live this week.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.875
And let me tell you...

23:18.919 --> 23:20.834
I just finished
making the car bomb.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.792
It is amazing.

23:22.836 --> 23:26.013
It could take out
a 50-story apartment building.

23:26.056 --> 23:27.884
Like that.

23:27.928 --> 23:30.409
- That's pretty cool.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.541
- So say yes.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.413
Be part of our family.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.462
- Okay.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.464
We're in.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.466
- That's fantastic.

23:47.164 --> 23:50.777
You did good.
You made the right decision.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.083
I'll call you guys tomorrow
with more details.

23:54.128 --> 23:55.825
- All right, let's go.

23:57.479 --> 23:58.437
- You did good.

23:58.480 --> 24:03.920
â™ª

24:03.964 --> 24:05.922
- What was that?

24:05.966 --> 24:08.447
I thought you said
these kids were gung ho.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.623
- I said they're open
to participate, which means,

24:10.666 --> 24:12.625
from a legal perspective,
they're predisposed.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.496
- Are you sure about that?

24:14.540 --> 24:16.585
- The test is pretty
straight-forward.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.152
Is it the defendant
an unwary innocent

24:18.195 --> 24:20.502
or an unwary criminal
who readily availed himself

24:20.546 --> 24:22.199
of the opportunity
to perpetrate the crime?

24:23.636 --> 24:25.942
To me, they're terrorists.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.770
- Hey.

24:27.814 --> 24:28.989
If those kids are terrorists,

24:29.032 --> 24:30.947
it is because
you radicalized them.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.213
You are pushing
these kids too hard.

24:36.257 --> 24:38.085
- You don't like
the way I do business,

24:38.128 --> 24:39.565
you call the Director.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.610
These are his rules.

24:47.921 --> 24:48.965
- What do you got?

24:49.009 --> 24:51.751
- Twenty-three imams
in Brooklyn.

24:51.794 --> 24:53.666
Four are on the FBI watch list.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.972
- Okay, let's run these names
by Homeland Security.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.887
See what they know.

25:01.804 --> 25:02.979
- I just feel like
this could be--

25:03.023 --> 25:04.503
- What do you mean
you're not sure?

25:04.546 --> 25:05.634
- I just feel like
the whole thing--

25:05.678 --> 25:07.157
- Nah, nah, listen to me.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.202
Grow some balls, Karim.

25:08.245 --> 25:10.204
Grow some balls.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.686
Don't mess this up.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.738
- Karim.

25:24.784 --> 25:25.741
- Hey.

25:25.785 --> 25:26.916
How's it going?

25:26.960 --> 25:28.004
- Yeah, it's good.

25:28.048 --> 25:31.834
I was just walking to my car.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.532
I saw you
from the corner of my eye.

25:33.575 --> 25:34.707
You need a ride?

25:34.750 --> 25:36.926
- No, no,
I'm gonna take the bus.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.713
But...

25:40.756 --> 25:42.932
do you mind...

25:42.976 --> 25:45.021
it's cool if I borrow a dollar?

25:47.023 --> 25:48.851
- Yeah.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.897
[speaking Arabic]

25:54.161 --> 25:55.554
- This is too much.

25:57.033 --> 25:58.861
- Keep it.

26:00.907 --> 26:02.561
- I really appreciate it.

26:04.911 --> 26:08.828
- So you and your friend...

26:08.871 --> 26:10.569
you sure you want to do this?

26:17.619 --> 26:19.578
- Yeah.

26:19.621 --> 26:26.585
â™ª

26:44.298 --> 26:45.908
- Hey.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.606
- Hey.
- What's going on?

26:47.649 --> 26:49.216
- Sorry, I tried to call,
but your phone was...

26:49.259 --> 26:51.871
- Oh, yeah,
it was a boxing class.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.655
- Yeah.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.744
- Is this about the new case?

26:55.788 --> 26:58.181
- Yeah.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.627
- I know this has been
a hard one.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.107
I've been listening.

27:11.151 --> 27:13.153
- Joseph's toying
with these guys...

27:14.154 --> 27:16.156
Especially Karim.

27:17.723 --> 27:21.161
I mean, all he cares about are
these beautiful women in Kabul.

27:21.204 --> 27:24.077
For God's sake...

27:24.120 --> 27:26.645
the kid has no clue.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.256
At all.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.780
He's just a dumb, lonely boy

27:31.824 --> 27:34.087
with no parents, no education.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.784
This is not okay.

27:35.828 --> 27:38.700
None of this is okay.

27:38.744 --> 27:42.922
- I mean, like it or not,
Joseph is following

27:42.965 --> 27:45.315
the Bureau's guidelines
and protocols.

27:47.709 --> 27:51.017
So maybe it's best
just to hang in there.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.019
Stick to the plan.

27:53.062 --> 27:56.065
- Even if it means
putting two kids in prison?

27:57.719 --> 27:59.329
And for life?

27:59.373 --> 28:01.375
- Look...

28:03.420 --> 28:07.686
I know that you identify more
with Karim and Rhami.

28:09.035 --> 28:11.037
I know where
you're coming from.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.216
- No, you don't.

28:20.437 --> 28:21.961
I'm sorry, Maggie,

28:22.004 --> 28:24.006
but you don't know
where I'm coming from.

28:25.051 --> 28:29.795
And you have never
been hated...

28:29.838 --> 28:31.753
for no reason.

28:31.797 --> 28:36.236
â™ª

28:36.279 --> 28:39.195
After 9/11...

28:39.239 --> 28:41.241
people were so cruel.

28:42.764 --> 28:46.333
So vicious.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.379
They said things
that you could never believe.

28:50.772 --> 28:54.341
And I was just a kid,
so I started to blame myself.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.735
I started to hate myself.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.739
It made me stronger.

29:00.782 --> 29:03.742
It made me love and respect
my faith even more.

29:07.354 --> 29:08.877
We're good people, Maggie.

29:08.921 --> 29:14.491
Muslims are good people,
loving and caring.

29:14.535 --> 29:17.277
And I just don't understand...

29:17.320 --> 29:19.975
why we are still fighting...

29:20.019 --> 29:20.976
for people to--

29:21.020 --> 29:25.285
for Americans...

29:25.328 --> 29:29.202
to understand that,
to believe that.

29:31.857 --> 29:36.818
And rolling up two dumb kids
who aren't really terrorists...

29:36.862 --> 29:39.473
is just going to add
to that fear

29:39.516 --> 29:42.345
and add to that hate...

29:42.389 --> 29:44.391
and it's not okay.

29:46.872 --> 29:49.091
- Yeah, but, OA...

29:49.135 --> 29:52.355
you don't know
if they're good or bad.

29:52.399 --> 29:57.317
You don't know if Karim
is on the road as a young OA...

29:57.360 --> 30:01.234
to a really good place...

30:01.277 --> 30:03.540
or if he is
a cold-blooded killer

30:03.584 --> 30:06.543
about to slaughter
hundreds of civilians.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.939
- You're right.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.991
I just don't know, Maggie.

30:21.602 --> 30:28.609
â™ª

30:32.178 --> 30:35.137
[melancholy rock music]

30:35.181 --> 30:42.188
â™ª

30:48.368 --> 30:50.849
- Hi, my name is Omar.
You must be Karim's sister.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.112
- He's not here.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.374
- Oh.

30:54.417 --> 30:56.202
We were supposed to meet up.

30:56.245 --> 30:57.856
- He left 10 minutes ago
with Rhami

30:57.899 --> 30:59.901
and some other guy
named Yasir.

30:59.945 --> 31:02.121
I think he's an imam.

31:02.164 --> 31:04.166
- Do you know where they went?

31:12.218 --> 31:13.523
Maggie, we have a problem.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.443
- Grab some coffee, people.

31:20.487 --> 31:21.880
We have three suspects
in the wind

31:21.923 --> 31:23.055
looking to commit
an act of terror.

31:23.098 --> 31:25.927
Rhami Maroun and Karim Khan,

31:25.971 --> 31:28.016
both 20 years old,
both from Astoria, Queens.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.496
Rhami has three priors--

31:29.539 --> 31:31.411
drugs, larceny, and assault,
all misdemeanors.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.021
Karim's jacket is clean.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.937
Now, word is they're working
with an imam

31:35.981 --> 31:37.634
from Brooklyn named
Yasir Moussad.

31:37.678 --> 31:39.985
Yasir is on
Homeland Security's watch list.

31:40.028 --> 31:41.595
He's considered
a credible threat.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.379
Homeland Security, Jim,
you're getting us everything

31:43.423 --> 31:45.468
you guys have on
Yasir Moussad ASAP.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.383
The rest of you,
focus on possible targets.

31:47.427 --> 31:49.995
Are there any concerts,
conferences, protests?

31:50.038 --> 31:52.388
Let's get to work.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.913
- FBI!

- What the hell?
What are you doing?

31:57.089 --> 31:59.918
What's going on?

31:59.961 --> 32:01.049
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know, I swear.

32:01.093 --> 32:02.355
- Where?

32:02.398 --> 32:03.922
- He doesn't tell me
where he goes.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.402
He's an idiot.
He just follows people.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.578
[dramatic music]

32:08.622 --> 32:11.930
- Does anybody have anything?

32:11.973 --> 32:13.235
- Got something.

All right, y'all, let's pivot.

32:21.635 --> 32:24.420
We have intel that Central Park
might be the target.

32:24.464 --> 32:25.987
Problem is
it's a pretty big park.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.293
2.5 miles long,
half a mile wide,

32:27.336 --> 32:29.034
so let's go to work.

32:29.077 --> 32:31.427
Start pulling live feeds
within a five-block radius,

32:31.471 --> 32:33.125
and let's find out what events
are taking place

32:33.168 --> 32:34.691
in or near the park today,
tomorrow--

on one of the kids, Karim.

He's on 98th

- Okay. Where's the bomb?

33:44.413 --> 33:45.675
- I-I don't know.

33:45.719 --> 33:48.113
- When do they plan
on detonating it?

33:48.156 --> 33:50.332
- 12:15. Rhami has a phone.
He's gonna dial a number.

33:50.376 --> 33:52.030
- Where are they, Karim?

33:52.073 --> 33:53.074
- Near the concession stands.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.467
- What are they wearing?

33:54.510 --> 33:57.339
- Yasir has a baseball cap.
It's black.

a younger sister
named Alexandra...

38:01.801 --> 38:06.284
and an older brother
named Doug...

38:06.327 --> 38:07.633
who died on 9/11.

38:08.851 --> 38:11.419
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

38:14.379 --> 38:16.685
I just figured it was a little
early in our partnership

38:16.729 --> 38:19.384
to get all...

38:19.427 --> 38:20.515
heavy.

38:22.082 --> 38:23.997
- I get it.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.615
- Come in.

38:38.403 --> 38:41.319
- Ma'am...

38:41.362 --> 38:43.364
I have to set
the record straight.

38:43.408 --> 38:46.367
- About what?

38:46.411 --> 38:48.804
- Earlier today,
I went to Karim's apartment.

38:48.848 --> 38:51.067
- I heard.

38:55.681 --> 38:58.510
Have you ever been to Omaha,
Agent Zidan?

39:01.904 --> 39:03.036
- No, ma'am.

39:04.472 --> 39:05.995
- We have a field office there.

39:06.039 --> 39:09.825
It's a place where
well-intentioned agents

39:09.869 --> 39:13.438
who act like
social workers go to die.

39:17.616 --> 39:20.662
- Ma'am,
with all due respect...

39:20.706 --> 39:22.577
We pushed that kid too hard.

39:23.709 --> 39:26.712
Turned him into something
that he's not.

39:27.843 --> 39:29.367
And I felt like
I had to do something,

39:29.410 --> 39:33.022
so I went Karim's
apartment to tip him off.

39:33.066 --> 39:34.763
- No.

39:34.807 --> 39:36.678
You went to his apartment
because you were concerned

39:36.722 --> 39:39.507
the operation with the imam
from Brooklyn was a go

39:39.551 --> 39:40.943
and that your friend Karim

39:40.987 --> 39:43.076
was on the verge
of being activated.

39:46.993 --> 39:49.909
As it turns out,
you were right.

39:54.043 --> 39:57.743
I care about results,
not process,

39:57.786 --> 40:00.746
as long as we get
the right results.

40:00.789 --> 40:06.055
â™ª

40:06.099 --> 40:09.537
What I'm saying to you
is you got lucky,

40:09.581 --> 40:10.712
real lucky.

40:10.756 --> 40:13.715
You hit on 19 and caught a 2,

40:13.759 --> 40:15.064
but if I were you,

40:15.108 --> 40:18.503
I wouldn't do something
so stupid again.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.901
Odds are it's not
gonna work out so well.

40:46.531 --> 40:47.793
- How was that?

40:47.836 --> 40:50.709
- Better than I thought,
I think.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.711
- So you're not fired?

40:52.754 --> 40:54.930
- No.
Not yet, at least.

40:54.974 --> 40:56.758
- [laughs]

40:58.804 --> 41:01.502
- Look, I should've
taken your advice.

41:02.547 --> 41:05.201
- Actually, I shouldn't
have given you any.

41:05.245 --> 41:08.466
You wanted someone to vent to,
and I should've just listened.

41:08.509 --> 41:09.858
You know, let you feel

41:09.902 --> 41:12.252
all the things
you were feeling.

41:14.820 --> 41:16.604
- Thank you.

41:28.660 --> 41:31.532
- We are pleased to announce
the FBI has apprehended

41:31.576 --> 41:34.143
three known
and dangerous terrorists,

41:34.187 --> 41:36.798
and were able to thwart
a coordinated

41:36.842 --> 41:40.628
and sophisticated attack
on the people of New York City.

41:40.672 --> 41:42.500
The three terrorists
apprehended--

41:42.543 --> 41:45.807
Yasir Moussad,
Rhami Maroun, and Karim Khan--

41:45.851 --> 41:47.505
were prepared
to detonate a bomb

41:47.548 --> 41:49.768
in Central Park
near a baseball field

41:49.811 --> 41:52.031
where young boys
and girls were playing,

41:52.074 --> 41:55.121
and parents
and friends were watching.

41:55.164 --> 41:57.819
Thanks to the heroism
of the New York Field Office,

41:57.863 --> 42:00.866
hundreds of innocent lives
were saved.

42:00.909 --> 42:03.259
We will continue
to use and deploy

42:03.303 --> 42:06.175
all of the vast resources
at our disposal

42:06.219 --> 42:09.265
to ensure that Americans
remain safe.

42:09.309 --> 42:12.834
We plan on doing everything
in our power to ensure

42:12.878 --> 42:14.183
these violent terrorists

42:14.227 --> 42:18.057
spend the rest
of their lives in prison.

42:19.841 --> 42:22.844
- I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

42:23.715 --> 42:25.586
- Yeah.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.196
I'm good.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.242
- I'll try and help.

42:31.287 --> 42:33.159
But...

42:40.645 --> 42:43.778
- I was excited
to go to Toronto.

42:47.869 --> 42:50.872
I've never been
on an airplane before.

42:55.921 --> 43:02.928
â™ª

43:14.853 --> 43:15.854
- Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

43:19.292 --> 43:22.251
[dramatic music]

43:22.295 --> 43:29.302
â™ª

43:38.311 --> 43:40.008
[wolf howling]
