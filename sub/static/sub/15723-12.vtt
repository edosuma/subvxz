00:00.738 --> 00:03.503
Haemorrhagic fever in smallpox.

00:03.817 --> 00:04.901
Game over.

00:05.356 --> 00:06.377
He's got it.

00:06.534 --> 00:08.733
- MI-5.
- MI-5, cool.

00:08.827 --> 00:10.476
Listen, we need to talk.

00:10.602 --> 00:12.337
Our friend Martin Jamieson, aka
William Zanzinger

00:12.421 --> 00:13.675
was found dead in Cape Town.

00:14.152 --> 00:15.723
Hey, write this down.

00:15.807 --> 00:19.862
Bethke Labs, B-E-T-H-K-E, Labs,
Cape Town, South Africa.

00:19.945 --> 00:22.492
Tell James Bond to get us all
the biohazard samples he can.

00:22.747 --> 00:25.171
We knew it was smallpox two days
ago when we started this.

00:25.214 --> 00:28.366
Now we've got National Guardsmen who
are sick and they were inoculated.

00:28.571 --> 00:31.319
20,000 dead and that's a diversion?
What the hell do they have in mind?

00:31.445 --> 00:32.320
Numbers, numbers, numbers!
Jesus Christ.

00:33.050 --> 00:34.479
- Marburg.
- Marburg?

00:34.605 --> 00:36.034
As in war
games Marburg.

00:36.349 --> 00:38.343
This doesn't ring any alarm
bells for you?

00:38.485 --> 00:39.710
Here, from the motherland.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.474
It's Marburg. It's not mine.

00:43.307 --> 00:45.129
Wait a minute,
this is weaponized?

00:45.333 --> 00:47.120
It looks like they increased

00:47.161 --> 00:49.354
the incubation period
of the virus.

00:50.548 --> 00:53.406
Well, I think we should keep
Gamelan here for a couple of days,

00:53.579 --> 00:55.699
put her on a drip, X-rays, blood work.

00:55.841 --> 00:56.877
If I didn't know so much,

00:56.956 --> 00:58.762
maybe I wouldn't think
that I could save Gamelan.

00:59.909 --> 01:01.150
I could just let her go.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.466
I'm going to go back to the
people I work with

01:03.549 --> 01:05.640
and tell them that this thing
came from Fort Egan.

01:07.098 --> 01:08.009
Okay.

01:09.407 --> 01:13.289
The man who ended up with the
viruses from Egan

01:13.374 --> 01:14.904
was Ivan Chiernegin.

01:14.961 --> 01:16.802
He was head of germ
warfare research

01:16.885 --> 01:19.695
- for the Soviets, wasn't he?
- My beloved boss.

01:19.937 --> 01:22.863
There's been a SARS-like case
reported in Denver, Colorado.

01:22.905 --> 01:25.616
The local doctors and public health
officials can't identify the virus.

01:25.647 --> 01:27.671
I don't want to sound paranoid,
but let's hope to God

01:27.713 --> 01:30.375
this isn't coming from the same
guy who gave us Miranda.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.296
1x12 - Resurrection

03:05.811 --> 03:08.568
It's all pretty much the same.
We're seeing respiratory tract infections

03:08.651 --> 03:11.406
leading to pneumonia,
pleurisy, as well as cyanosis.

03:11.622 --> 03:12.747
How low is the hemoglobin?

03:12.809 --> 03:14.626
It varies.
You can look at the charts.

03:14.733 --> 03:17.246
It's basically higher in patients
in the 20-40 year old range.

03:17.355 --> 03:18.785
Flu-like symptoms at first,

03:18.848 --> 03:20.576
it worsens over the course
of 24 hours.

03:20.780 --> 03:23.168
Runny nose, aches and pains,
in some cases diarrhea.

03:23.325 --> 03:24.943
Any poxes, rashes, lesions?

03:25.052 --> 03:26.812
Fatality was diagnosed
as pneumonia.

03:27.676 --> 03:28.979
How many in quarantine?

03:29.262 --> 03:31.194
Well, we've got 12 in there now.

03:31.272 --> 03:33.189
We're running out of room.

03:40.799 --> 03:42.778
Has there been
any response to medication?

03:42.903 --> 03:44.254
Not as much as we hoped.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.233
Did you try Zanamivir
or Oxycodan?

03:46.348 --> 03:47.479
Acetaminophen...

03:47.558 --> 03:48.421
We tried them all.

03:48.531 --> 03:50.322
We definitely think it
is a new strain.

03:50.416 --> 03:52.238
It's just not acting like any
we've had before.

04:00.667 --> 04:03.204
- Okay, let's pick it apart.
- Samples from every patient.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.560
We're going to need a complete
set of specimens from the fatality.

04:05.623 --> 04:07.124
Where are you at with
your isolation protocols?

04:07.202 --> 04:08.563
- We're at high levels.
- Bump them to critical.

04:08.645 --> 04:10.355
- Sure.
- Can I set up a station in your lab?

04:10.438 --> 04:12.523
- Of course, it's just right this way.
- Is this okay?

04:12.605 --> 04:15.400
- Oh, you're fine in here.
- All right, I'll catch up with you guys later.

04:15.958 --> 04:17.221
- Yeah?
- How bad is it?

04:17.911 --> 04:19.923
You're going to have to
coordinate a press release

04:20.017 --> 04:22.169
- with the WHO and the CDC.
- What have you got?

04:22.263 --> 04:24.666
Tests so far on this virus
can't tell us what it is

04:24.776 --> 04:26.567
except it's incredibly virulent
and contagious.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.786
- Made in a lab?
- It looks natural on the outside.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.168
Is it Marburg?

04:30.262 --> 04:32.147
So far no poxes,
no internal hemorrhaging.

04:32.210 --> 04:33.623
I'm pretty sure we can
rule that out.

04:33.702 --> 04:34.849
What is it?

04:34.927 --> 04:36.369
We're working on it.

04:36.702 --> 04:38.954
- Okay, stay in touch.
- You too.

04:43.927 --> 04:46.408
Ivan Chiernegin is Ivan Havlac.

04:46.566 --> 04:48.199
- According to who?
- David.

04:49.220 --> 04:50.477
I thought he was the scientist

04:50.539 --> 04:51.920
and I was the intelligence agent.

04:51.962 --> 04:53.712
Find Chiernegin
and you'll find the bastard

04:53.791 --> 04:55.408
who made the Miranda virus

04:55.566 --> 04:58.132
and maybe stop
another potential epidemic.

04:59.056 --> 05:00.843
Wait a minute,
what are you talking about here?

05:01.412 --> 05:03.454
We've got a bad viral strain
in the States.

05:03.579 --> 05:04.977
It's spreading fast.

05:05.344 --> 05:07.596
It could have been
manufactured in a lab.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.546
Or what? A Chiernegin lab?

05:09.813 --> 05:10.347
Yeah.

05:10.787 --> 05:13.065
You're getting a lot of doors
slammed in your face, aren't you?

05:13.143 --> 05:14.038
Yeah...

05:14.337 --> 05:15.562
Wait a minute!

05:15.813 --> 05:17.769
What aren't you saying?

05:18.169 --> 05:19.504
Come on.

05:20.777 --> 05:21.986
Colin!

05:23.855 --> 05:25.206
Come on.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.588
Do you...

05:32.808 --> 05:34.661
Do you remember Jersey Shores?

05:35.996 --> 05:37.112
Colin...

05:37.206 --> 05:38.949
Navasink light station. Hum?

05:39.091 --> 05:40.156
Don't go there.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.106
Just indulge me, will you?

05:44.227 --> 05:46.300
I remember it was raining,

05:46.951 --> 05:51.038
I remember we didn't even make
it to the top of the stairs.

05:55.614 --> 05:57.530
I've got a big problem.

05:57.829 --> 05:59.376
I need your help.

06:08.062 --> 06:09.118
Sit still.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.743
What do you know about Chiernegin?

06:16.811 --> 06:18.916
Ran the Soviet's biochemical

06:19.010 --> 06:22.264
weapons program until 1989.

06:22.879 --> 06:24.900
After the wall came down.
Is that it?

06:24.994 --> 06:25.643
Pretty much.

06:27.434 --> 06:29.059
You've got to tell me.

06:31.311 --> 06:34.129
After the CIA got hold of him,
they hired him to monitor

06:34.223 --> 06:37.923
the Iraqi chemical weapons program
during the Iraqi/Iran conflict.

06:38.166 --> 06:39.250
Monitor it?

06:39.817 --> 06:43.490
Iraq threw every chemical weapon they had
at the Iranians during that war.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.302
Yeah, hundreds of thousands were killed,
and where were the United States?

06:46.365 --> 06:47.707
I know, I know...

06:47.770 --> 06:50.781
Officialy, it was none of our business.

06:51.853 --> 06:53.565
So, what happened to him?

06:53.675 --> 06:55.230
Errant cruise missile.

06:55.325 --> 06:57.410
Wiped out the
entire compound.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.404
So, why doesn't anyone want to
talk about a dead guy?

07:00.529 --> 07:01.539
I don't know.

07:02.026 --> 07:04.414
Do you still got somebody
deeper in Washington?

07:05.775 --> 07:06.655
I might.

07:07.801 --> 07:09.332
Do want to keep me
in the loop?

07:09.417 --> 07:11.126
I will.

07:16.129 --> 07:18.686
When all this is said and done,
do you...

07:20.801 --> 07:22.105
...want to still...

07:23.465 --> 07:24.963
I would.

07:32.214 --> 07:33.251
Thanks, Digby.

07:35.434 --> 07:37.036
- What? Is that it?
- Yup.

07:37.507 --> 07:39.047
That's... That...
Come here, listen!

07:39.423 --> 07:41.893
This is lung tissue
from a 29 year old male

07:41.976 --> 07:43.661
a day after being admitted.

07:43.818 --> 07:45.153
It's dense tissue.

07:45.341 --> 07:48.012
- Here's what's a little scary.
- This isn't?

07:48.184 --> 07:49.724
This is the patient...

07:50.179 --> 07:51.718
a day after admittance.

07:53.979 --> 07:55.694
Five hours,

07:55.776 --> 07:58.052
temperature's up to 101.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.888
Eight hours, 30 minutes,

08:00.919 --> 08:03.275
the temperature spikes up to 105,

08:03.369 --> 08:05.443
lung are 93% filled with fluid.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.275
Jesus.

08:06.495 --> 08:08.929
We managed to keep him alive
for another 4 hours.

08:09.118 --> 08:11.380
What sort of lab results
do you have?

08:11.521 --> 08:14.081
Blood cultures.
They're all pretty much consistent.

08:14.254 --> 08:15.412
PCR, mass spec.

08:15.490 --> 08:17.815
But we're not equipped to run
those tests.

08:17.909 --> 08:19.354
Okay, let me see what you got.

08:19.495 --> 08:21.192
Networking to the mainframe.

08:21.317 --> 08:22.834
- Thanks.
- No problem.

08:29.296 --> 08:32.818
Do you think it might have something
to do with a specific blood type?

08:34.131 --> 08:35.096
I don't know.

08:39.116 --> 08:41.080
Oh, interesting idea.

08:42.510 --> 08:44.379
You can read the screen
from over there?

08:44.457 --> 08:45.023
Sure.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.939
What does this say?

08:51.431 --> 08:52.851
Go away.

09:06.993 --> 09:10.087
Bob, I'm going to need you
to coordinate a team

09:10.229 --> 09:12.585
to get going on some
PCR sequences.

09:14.218 --> 09:14.878
Bob?

09:15.003 --> 09:17.784
I've scanned over a hundred genes
so far and I've come up empty.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.621
What are you talking about?

09:19.716 --> 09:23.250
Scanning the canine genome to
identify the genetic basis of MH.

09:23.359 --> 09:24.912
I'm not having any luck.

09:25.119 --> 09:28.260
Bob, blood cultures.
David and Jill are sending blood...

09:28.401 --> 09:30.930
Specimens, I know.
I have a team ready to do PCR

09:31.056 --> 09:33.695
and mass spectrometry work
as soon as the samples arrive.

09:33.805 --> 09:35.454
Good. Okay.

09:37.729 --> 09:39.714
What are you working on?

09:40.044 --> 09:42.047
Malignant histiocytosis.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.411
Gamelan's been diagnosed with it.

09:44.505 --> 09:45.215
Your dog?

09:46.465 --> 09:49.092
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.824
The dog genome project
has been really helpful.

09:52.044 --> 09:53.553
I haven't heard of it.

09:54.133 --> 09:54.699
Oh.

10:00.432 --> 10:03.479
It was done by a cancer
research center in the States.

10:04.861 --> 10:08.269
They are working
on identifying the mutant gene

10:08.395 --> 10:10.343
that causes histiocytosis,

10:10.547 --> 10:13.861
and they think they're about
2 years away from finding the right one.

10:15.470 --> 10:17.433
I don't think Gamelan's
got two years.

10:18.693 --> 10:21.925
But they've mapped out
the entire canine genome.

10:22.035 --> 10:23.112
Isn't it amazing?

10:23.153 --> 10:26.197
So, all I have to do is
compare Gamelan's genes

10:26.386 --> 10:28.962
to a healthy map
and I'll find it.

10:29.950 --> 10:33.133
I know, there are
30,000 genes in a dog.

10:33.447 --> 10:37.028
But I might get lucky.
I'm doing random scans.

10:37.248 --> 10:39.589
I could find the right mutated gene.

10:39.683 --> 10:41.364
You could, of course.

10:41.615 --> 10:43.091
Yeah, sure.

10:43.582 --> 10:45.856
Uh, when those blood cultures come in

10:45.934 --> 10:49.214
we're going to need you to get
to work on that.

10:49.544 --> 10:50.706
Okay, of course.

10:56.109 --> 10:58.622
Bob, you know
I have some free time now,

10:58.764 --> 11:00.963
maybe if you want
you could give me

11:01.088 --> 11:02.942
a set of genes to scan.

11:05.203 --> 11:06.978
- Thank you, Carlos.
- Okay.

11:08.638 --> 11:09.476
Thank you.

11:20.912 --> 11:22.043
Every bone...

11:22.247 --> 11:24.682
Every bone in my body feels
like it's broken.

11:25.232 --> 11:26.331
Jesus, I feel like shit.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.839
Well, I'll talk to your doctors

11:27.918 --> 11:30.164
and see if we can't make you
more comfortable.

11:30.368 --> 11:32.205
- You're not a doctor?
- PhD.

11:32.708 --> 11:34.766
You're all scientists
from Canada.

11:37.486 --> 11:39.528
Somebody said it was SARS.

11:39.638 --> 11:40.423
Is that it?

11:40.502 --> 11:43.140
Is that why you guys are down
here from Toronto?

11:43.219 --> 11:46.140
Because if I've got SARS,
I'm going to sue.

11:46.627 --> 11:49.973
I don't think you can sue a city
that contained an epidemic.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.803
You hang in there.

11:54.573 --> 11:55.280
Thanks.

11:57.699 --> 11:58.515
Thank you.

12:06.573 --> 12:08.395
Poor guy.
At least if it was SARS,

12:08.521 --> 12:10.673
we'd know what we were dealing with.

12:10.751 --> 12:12.844
Okay, get these in a priority
box to NorBAC

12:12.954 --> 12:15.427
and we'll get back to it
in 15 minutes.

12:15.919 --> 12:17.191
Thank you.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.419
- How's it going?
- I don't know, what do you got?

12:30.501 --> 12:32.503
Well, they've just admitted
3 more patients

12:32.545 --> 12:35.255
- and there's a rumour that it's SARS.
- It isn't SARS. 

12:35.333 --> 12:37.591
More a corona virus,
they're running an ELISA test,

12:37.650 --> 12:40.090
but my hunch is
it's a type-A flu strain.

12:40.132 --> 12:43.760
But without a decent PCR run or mass
spec, we can't know that for sure.

12:43.843 --> 12:46.611
The only other useful test we can
run down here is an antibody array.

12:46.768 --> 12:48.300
- All right. I'll get on it.
- Okay.

12:50.096 --> 12:52.932
Jill, I want you to go wide on
that victim down in the morgue.

12:53.014 --> 12:54.599
Brain, lungs, heart.

12:54.682 --> 12:55.730
Everything.

12:56.225 --> 12:57.615
Samples of everything.

12:57.713 --> 12:59.852
Freeze them and send them to
Carlos right away.

13:00.874 --> 13:02.312
David, what are you thinking?

13:03.662 --> 13:05.763
I just want to be thorough.

13:08.904 --> 13:10.003
All right.

13:17.311 --> 13:19.526
Chiernegin. Where'd you pull
that one out of?

13:19.605 --> 13:21.662
Well, can you tell me
about him?

13:21.741 --> 13:22.573
No.

13:23.186 --> 13:25.919
I thought you knew
what was going on around here.

13:27.718 --> 13:30.387
Ivan Chiernegin was a Soviet biochemist

13:30.470 --> 13:33.422
who worked with everything from
sarin to REX.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.935
He ended up
working for the CIA in Iraq.

13:36.131 --> 13:38.330
As far as the United States
is concerned,

13:38.468 --> 13:39.956
Chiernegin doesn't exist.

13:40.784 --> 13:43.018
I didn't hear it
from you, Conner.

13:47.396 --> 13:50.731
After the U.S. and Iraq's
relationship fell apart,

13:50.815 --> 13:53.817
Hussein offered Chiernegin
a palace on the Tigress

13:53.900 --> 13:56.049
and all the money he wanted
to work for him.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.790
We knew where he was and decided
to take decisive action.

13:59.821 --> 14:02.067
So, it wasn't an errant
cruise missile.

14:02.949 --> 14:05.399
It was believed that
he was neutralized.

14:05.446 --> 14:07.488
Along with his wife and child.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.357
They were confirmed.

14:10.268 --> 14:12.514
Around the summer of '97,

14:12.640 --> 14:15.483
Ivan Chiernegin reportedly
surfaced in North Korea.

14:15.703 --> 14:17.330
A couple of years later
in Pakistan,

14:17.414 --> 14:20.958
leaving behind bio-warfare
programs in each country.

14:21.546 --> 14:24.084
He dropped off our
radar around 2000.

14:25.017 --> 14:28.464
Which would be around the time
he dropped down to Cape Town

14:28.574 --> 14:30.490
and started
to work on Miranda.

14:31.375 --> 14:33.789
When this thing first hit, this...

14:35.595 --> 14:37.291
This Miranda virus...

14:37.888 --> 14:39.836
people around here
did get a little jumpy.

14:40.024 --> 14:40.684
Wait a minute.

14:40.778 --> 14:43.762
They knew that Chiernegin could
have been behind the Miranda virus?

14:43.919 --> 14:45.878
I don't know, but
when NorBAC first suggested

14:45.972 --> 14:48.846
that Miranda was
a camel pox/ebola blend,

14:49.003 --> 14:51.359
the folks at Fort Egan went to work
and compared it to their own.

14:51.469 --> 14:53.338
- And?
- Not the same.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.757
- Far more virulent than what we make.
- Oh, come on Conner.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.437
Even I can make the leap.

14:57.479 --> 15:01.355
Fort Egan misplaces a milder strain
of Miranda, it ends up in the hands

15:01.449 --> 15:03.816
of a Soviet biochemist
with a vengeance towards the West,

15:03.900 --> 15:07.679
he ends up in well equipped lab
in Cape Town, South Africa...

15:08.056 --> 15:09.861
Yeah, it makes sense.

15:10.647 --> 15:12.815
Why didn't anyone at Fort Egan
share information

15:13.019 --> 15:15.218
with us when we were trying
to figure it out?

15:16.740 --> 15:20.618
The United States doesn't manufacture
chemical or biological weapons.

15:23.354 --> 15:24.893
Yeah, right.

16:23.077 --> 16:23.925
It can't be.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.804
Okay...

16:34.071 --> 16:35.619
Here we are.

16:38.311 --> 16:38.955
Sit.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.133
Come on.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.484
How are you, Bob?

16:46.353 --> 16:49.460
I'm fine.
So, there's nothing you can do.

16:50.374 --> 16:53.201
Bob, we could try another transfusion

16:53.311 --> 16:55.777
but it's very unlikely
that it would...

16:56.076 --> 16:57.090
I understand.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.048
If we operated now...

16:59.968 --> 17:00.800
I know.

17:00.883 --> 17:03.737
And even if we could take out
the spleen,

17:03.847 --> 17:07.538
we can't be sure it's not already
in her heart, lungs...

17:11.229 --> 17:12.816
Is she in any pain?

17:12.894 --> 17:14.715
I don't think so. Not yet.

17:14.888 --> 17:15.934
Not yet?

17:16.346 --> 17:20.603
Histiocytes attach and grow
throughout every organ.

17:22.796 --> 17:25.137
The heart will have
to pump harder,

17:25.309 --> 17:28.058
the lungs will struggle
for more oxygen.

17:28.812 --> 17:29.775
What can I do?

17:30.179 --> 17:33.571
You can take her home,
make her as comfortable as possible.

17:33.728 --> 17:37.152
She'll probably be just
the way she is right now.

17:40.703 --> 17:42.101
I had a bag for her.

17:42.808 --> 17:46.368
- Her ball and blanket and bowl.
- It's in the back.

17:47.096 --> 17:48.713
You want to take her home?

17:51.352 --> 17:53.122
I'm so sorry, Bob.

17:54.242 --> 17:55.290
I'll go get it.

18:14.773 --> 18:15.323
Hey.

18:16.046 --> 18:16.526
Hi.

18:17.358 --> 18:19.337
Dr. Sandstrom's not here?

18:19.510 --> 18:20.846
No, he left.

18:21.379 --> 18:23.013
Left? Left where?

18:23.390 --> 18:26.516
I assume on a plane by now,
back to Toronto.

18:33.535 --> 18:35.146
Hey Joe, it's me.
Are you there?

18:37.414 --> 18:40.995
Listen, call me as soon as you get
this message, okay? It's very important.

18:51.461 --> 18:53.078
Oh, you're fucking beautiful.

18:54.665 --> 18:56.267
You are one sick seal.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.406
You got it, David.

18:58.736 --> 19:00.337
The Spanish flu.

19:01.249 --> 19:02.709
- Intact.
- We got it.

19:02.851 --> 19:04.359
- We got it.
- We got it!

19:05.584 --> 19:07.312
You know your terminal?

19:08.050 --> 19:11.411
Your terminal? You're going
to Canada, right?

19:12.982 --> 19:14.772
Do you know your terminal?

19:15.746 --> 19:16.516
No...

19:16.924 --> 19:19.484
West, I think. Air Canada.

19:30.329 --> 19:31.727
Your cell phone's ringing.

19:35.465 --> 19:36.298
Yeah?

19:36.722 --> 19:38.889
- Was it something I said?
- What?

19:38.968 --> 19:40.868
David, you just took off.
Where are you?

19:41.041 --> 19:43.821
- I'm in a cab at the airport.
- Why? What's going on?

19:44.151 --> 19:45.926
Nothing. I just...

19:46.758 --> 19:48.832
I need to get back to the lab.

19:49.460 --> 19:51.722
- Something's not...
- Not what?

19:52.256 --> 19:53.905
Not what? David, what is it?

19:54.093 --> 19:55.802
Nothing. I just...

19:55.943 --> 19:57.577
Listen, finish getting all those samples
okay,

19:57.656 --> 19:59.509
and then get them back to the lab
as soon as you can.

19:59.651 --> 20:01.086
All right.
I'll stay on it all night.

20:01.212 --> 20:03.043
Good. I'll see you back
in Toronto.

20:03.109 --> 20:03.800
Okay, David,
are you...

20:40.935 --> 20:41.642
David?

20:42.412 --> 20:43.810
I'm sorry, did I scare you?

20:43.888 --> 20:45.663
What the fuck are you
doing here, Bob?

20:45.746 --> 20:48.957
I just... I had some work to
be done and Gamelan is...

20:49.040 --> 20:51.773
I need you to purify this
blood for a PCR run, okay?

20:52.056 --> 20:52.709
Sure.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.569
Are you running
anything on the mass spec?

20:54.773 --> 20:56.501
I had some
histiocyte cells...

20:56.563 --> 20:58.754
Okay, well this is
definitively a priority.

20:58.796 --> 21:00.961
I understand.
Is this from Denver?

21:01.056 --> 21:02.297
- Yeah.
- I see.

21:03.317 --> 21:05.341
David, I have
a hard decision to make.

21:05.383 --> 21:06.537
Not now, Bob.

21:07.715 --> 21:10.731
I really need you to do
this blood work for me, okay?

21:12.302 --> 21:12.971
All right.

21:51.334 --> 21:52.512
David.

21:52.685 --> 21:54.113
David, did you hear me?

21:54.193 --> 21:55.716
- What?
- When did you get back?

21:55.795 --> 21:57.758
I don't know. Last night.

21:57.915 --> 21:59.659
Well, how did it go in Denver?

22:01.764 --> 22:02.910
What are you working on?

22:03.067 --> 22:04.889
Mayko, do you need me
for something?

22:05.298 --> 22:07.638
- What's your problem?
- I'm busy, okay?

22:10.025 --> 22:12.146
Hey, David. You're back.

22:14.109 --> 22:14.973
Yes.

22:17.858 --> 22:21.429
Bob, we just received the samples
from Denver.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.470
Bob, the PCR sequencing?

22:23.596 --> 22:25.999
I already did it this morning
for David.

22:28.749 --> 22:29.785
Where are they?

22:30.194 --> 22:32.330
I don't know. I gave them
to David to read.

22:37.794 --> 22:38.878
David...

22:39.365 --> 22:43.147
We just got the samples,
Bob says that you've already run them?

22:43.230 --> 22:44.972
Just one.
Do all the other victims.

22:45.315 --> 22:47.454
Okay, you got something or...?

22:48.302 --> 22:49.692
David, I got confirmation

22:49.734 --> 22:52.198
- that Chiernegin is alive.
- So, find the fucker.

22:52.276 --> 22:54.403
Do you know what we're dealing
with in Denver?

22:54.487 --> 22:55.905
You'll know when I know, Caroline!

22:59.602 --> 23:00.800
I don't know.

23:01.219 --> 23:04.124
His temperature hit 104
early this morning.

23:04.266 --> 23:07.046
Lungs are filled up.
None of the antivirals work.

23:08.098 --> 23:10.627
It's been 24 hours since
he was admitted?

23:10.800 --> 23:12.213
If that.

23:21.810 --> 23:24.700
About two thirds of the people
who are in there

23:24.826 --> 23:26.868
- have had their flu shot.
- Got it.

23:27.873 --> 23:30.386
Well, flu viruses mutate.
That's a given.

23:30.952 --> 23:33.732
I guess the question is,
can we stop it?

23:35.083 --> 23:35.664
Yeah.

23:43.316 --> 23:44.400
Mayko...

23:44.557 --> 23:47.410
- Here are the fragments.
- Oh, okay. Thanks.

23:52.998 --> 23:53.799
Hello?

23:53.956 --> 23:55.197
Hey Jill.

23:55.417 --> 23:58.024
We're just trying to put together
a total gene sequence now.

23:58.213 --> 24:00.673
Okay, anything panning out
with David's hunch?

24:00.845 --> 24:04.336
Type-A flu looks like a possibility,
but Jill,

24:04.378 --> 24:07.317
-  we've never seen anything like it.
- That figures.

24:07.725 --> 24:09.327
Just keep on it.

24:09.987 --> 24:11.102
Is David there?

24:11.322 --> 24:13.332
He got back last night.
What is with him?

24:13.442 --> 24:14.636
Is he acting strange?

24:14.809 --> 24:16.332
Yeah, he's totally intense.

24:16.505 --> 24:18.830
I mean he hasn't come out of his
office since this morning.

24:20.368 --> 24:21.405
Try and talk to him.

24:21.530 --> 24:23.823
I mean, I don't know...
I don't know what's going on,

24:23.949 --> 24:27.782
- but try to talk to him, Mayko. Okay?
- Yeah, sure.

24:27.892 --> 24:30.892
- Are you on your way back?
- Yeah, I'll be in the lab as soon as I can.

24:31.348 --> 24:32.432
Okay, safe trip.

24:32.714 --> 24:33.704
I'll see you soon.

24:42.111 --> 24:42.912
David.

24:44.341 --> 24:45.865
David, are you all right?

24:47.483 --> 24:50.113
- Do you want to talk?
- Leave me alone, Mayko.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.310
Leave me alone.

26:03.015 --> 26:05.733
David, you should take a look
at these flu sequences.

26:10.310 --> 26:11.202
David.

26:38.791 --> 26:39.623
Joe.

26:41.068 --> 26:43.314
Joe, if you're there pick up, okay?

26:44.037 --> 26:47.272
I need you to go out and see if
that body's still there.

26:48.199 --> 26:50.461
You be careful, all right.
Don't touch it.

26:55.094 --> 26:56.697
I'm serious, Vasili.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.830
Is this the Spanish flu
that you dug up the northern?

27:01.754 --> 27:03.121
I told you about Nunavut?

27:03.466 --> 27:06.458
The vodka and the marijuana
did in New York, remember?

27:10.207 --> 27:11.714
It's in Denver, Vasili.

27:13.348 --> 27:14.762
I think I put it there.

27:25.886 --> 27:28.275
Hey Lil, it's me.

27:28.888 --> 27:30.050
I...

27:34.348 --> 27:36.615
I just wanted you to know...

27:38.108 --> 27:39.505
I love you.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.581
I just wanted to call
and say that.

27:59.757 --> 28:01.139
Hey Jill, it's me.

28:03.825 --> 28:05.710
I really need to talk to you.

28:07.610 --> 28:10.265
If you haven't figured
it out by now.

28:11.245 --> 28:13.359
Shit, I can explain.

28:14.773 --> 28:17.647
I really fucked up this time.

28:19.002 --> 28:20.395
Really...

28:20.572 --> 28:22.836
I really fucked up this time.

28:23.556 --> 28:24.420
Call me.

28:29.964 --> 28:31.606
Okay, Sandstrom,

28:32.002 --> 28:34.185
get your shit together.

28:35.651 --> 28:37.810
You're going to go
back to the lab

28:37.928 --> 28:40.324
and tell them what's going on.

28:43.583 --> 28:44.623
Caroline.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.863
Call Caroline.

29:34.762 --> 29:35.830
What?

29:36.333 --> 29:38.422
We went to your house
when we fucked up,

29:38.579 --> 29:40.762
my house when we were fucked up.

29:41.171 --> 29:41.864
Danny?

29:43.528 --> 29:46.135
How about getting laid?
You want to do that?

29:47.847 --> 29:49.494
Just keep driving the car, Danny.

29:49.536 --> 29:51.758
Do you want a drink?
Do you want to get wasted?

29:51.978 --> 29:53.288
I am wasted. I'm done.

29:55.206 --> 29:57.207
You don't want to go there,
man. Believe--

29:57.290 --> 29:59.596
- It's my fucking life.
- Fine, you drive.

30:03.821 --> 30:04.528
Sit down!

30:09.089 --> 30:11.340
I am not going to make
this easy for you.

30:15.551 --> 30:17.009
You don't know
what you're doing man.

30:17.051 --> 30:19.682
Did you when you took
that bottle of pills?

30:19.761 --> 30:21.787
Yes, I did.
I had nothing left.

30:21.897 --> 30:24.960
- Yeah, well neither do I.
- Get the fuck out of my cab.

30:28.378 --> 30:29.415
How bad is it?

30:29.642 --> 30:32.038
Right now he has severe
cerebral edema.

30:33.954 --> 30:35.271
I'm calling in

30:35.312 --> 30:39.606
a specialist from Boston.
He'll be here tonight.

30:39.648 --> 30:42.442
All right. Well, we'll monitor
him overnight.

30:44.526 --> 30:46.610
Definitely no way of knowing.

30:48.821 --> 30:53.115
Other than the head trauma and a few
fractured ribs and some other minor injuries.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.085
He's very lucky.

30:59.033 --> 31:00.610
Come on, David.

31:00.861 --> 31:02.856
We've got work to do.

31:04.579 --> 31:06.233
Hey, come on, buddy.

31:10.112 --> 31:12.060
You're going to be okay, right?

31:40.440 --> 31:42.246
Well hi, Gamelan.

31:43.560 --> 31:44.869
Hello.

31:45.434 --> 31:46.942
Who's a good girl?

31:47.241 --> 31:49.094
Hi, good girl.

31:56.927 --> 31:58.073
Hey, you're back.

31:58.402 --> 31:59.707
Yeah, how's it going?

31:59.986 --> 32:02.597
We haven't heard anything.
They're watching him tonight.

32:02.722 --> 32:03.555
Who?

32:06.995 --> 32:08.251
You didn't hear?

32:08.824 --> 32:11.160
David, he was hit by a car.

32:11.314 --> 32:14.787
A cab.
He's in the hospital in a coma.

32:15.889 --> 32:16.863
What?

32:17.663 --> 32:19.266
In intensive care.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.959
I want to keep
working on things.

32:26.043 --> 32:28.419
I'm not good
at things like this.

32:28.461 --> 32:30.873
I'm better when I'm working,
trying to fix things.

32:33.339 --> 32:35.601
Yeah, sure. I understand that.

32:39.634 --> 32:41.885
I like dogs
better than people.

32:43.387 --> 32:44.895
They don't judge,

32:44.974 --> 32:46.497
they're not duplicitous.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.466
They can't confuse
you like people do.

32:51.351 --> 32:52.953
Mayko's down at the hospital.

32:53.063 --> 32:55.293
She's going to call if there
are any changes in his condition.

32:56.220 --> 32:57.520
Are you going to
go down there?

33:01.780 --> 33:04.890
Yeah... Yeah, I guess I should.

33:08.660 --> 33:09.696
Okay.

33:19.026 --> 33:20.031
Gamelan.

33:40.331 --> 33:41.430
Hey, pal.

33:42.844 --> 33:44.320
You're looking good.

33:46.896 --> 33:48.985
You're going to be okay.

33:59.373 --> 34:00.409
Hey, Jill.

34:02.278 --> 34:03.331
Hey, Mayko.

34:04.226 --> 34:05.624
How's it going?

34:07.399 --> 34:08.907
The same.

34:10.493 --> 34:12.629
Every now and then
he kind of moans,

34:12.708 --> 34:14.481
but then he seems
to go away.

34:15.534 --> 34:17.152
Are you going to
stay all night?

34:17.357 --> 34:18.174
Yeah.

34:19.839 --> 34:21.188
Yeah...

34:21.456 --> 34:24.194
I think if I talk to him,

34:24.277 --> 34:26.654
I think he might hear me.

34:27.534 --> 34:29.199
He might answer, you know.

34:32.366 --> 34:33.761
Are you okay?

34:34.326 --> 34:35.630
Yeah.

34:36.577 --> 34:37.311
Shit.

34:39.384 --> 34:41.371
The more I know...

34:41.413 --> 34:43.168
I've only known the guy 6 months.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.498
He really gets under
your skin, doesn't he?

34:45.540 --> 34:46.168
Yeah.

34:48.808 --> 34:50.206
You want some company?

34:50.960 --> 34:52.373
Sure.

34:53.206 --> 34:54.871
You reckon David does?

34:55.609 --> 34:56.646
Yeah.

36:26.704 --> 36:27.332
David.

36:34.070 --> 36:35.861
When did you get here?

36:38.814 --> 36:39.992
I don't know.

36:41.343 --> 36:42.348
200.

36:45.269 --> 36:46.055
Clear.

36:53.855 --> 36:55.284
I'm not hungry.

36:55.410 --> 36:58.363
- You have to keep your strength up.
- I don't want to.

36:58.488 --> 37:01.535
You have to get better.
It's good for you.

37:01.865 --> 37:04.677
- What is it?
- Soup. Your favorite.

37:05.619 --> 37:07.253
You made red lentil?

37:07.394 --> 37:08.383
Eat.

37:22.851 --> 37:24.246
That's mine.

37:24.393 --> 37:26.553
That's the gun that killed me.

37:27.584 --> 37:30.063
That's not for you.

37:34.280 --> 37:34.924
Go to 300.

37:35.804 --> 37:37.940
Don't die on me, David.
Don't die.

37:38.112 --> 37:38.945
Clear.

37:40.029 --> 37:41.599
Do you want
something to drink?

37:51.771 --> 37:53.945
Everything I do turns to shit.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.438
You don't want
to get better, do you?

38:02.364 --> 38:03.197
No.

38:04.501 --> 38:06.087
Go to 360.

38:07.139 --> 38:07.815
Clear.

38:26.082 --> 38:27.165
No pulse?

38:29.647 --> 38:31.532
Alright. Come back.

38:32.349 --> 38:33.767
Can I have a litre of saline?

38:33.850 --> 38:35.602
His volumes might be low.

38:35.684 --> 38:37.436
Check his blood pressure.

38:42.008 --> 38:43.736
Interesting isn't it?

38:44.270 --> 38:45.405
Very.

38:45.767 --> 38:48.672
- They're definitely influenza-A.
- I can see that.

38:48.877 --> 38:51.500
It's the most common strain
of the flu virus.

38:52.295 --> 38:54.782
Influenza-B, influenza-C,

38:55.002 --> 38:56.363
Hong Kong, Russian.

38:56.442 --> 38:58.609
- Bob.
- Asian, Swine, Avian.

38:58.735 --> 39:00.400
- Bob!
- We're not even close.

39:00.478 --> 39:02.693
Bob, slow down.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.494
I'm sorry, I guess
I'm not very focused.

39:05.535 --> 39:07.870
Are you having a hard time
concentrating with David...?

39:07.953 --> 39:09.531
David's in good hands, Bob.

39:09.751 --> 39:11.628
Okay, stop.
He's going to be okay.

39:12.759 --> 39:15.792
That's why I have to think.
That's what'll get us through.

39:27.515 --> 39:30.343
On top of everything
his dog is dying.

39:31.925 --> 39:34.611
- Good morning.
- Hey, welcome back.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.949
Thank you.
Where are we on the virus?

39:37.122 --> 39:38.758
I've sequenced 2 segments.

39:38.852 --> 39:41.820
So far nothing is hanging,
and it's no Marburg, no Miranda.

39:41.946 --> 39:43.313
Just influenza-A.

39:43.438 --> 39:44.517
It has to be.

39:48.835 --> 39:51.192
Wait a minute.
This is what came out of Denver?

39:51.491 --> 39:52.700
That's what you sent.

39:54.859 --> 39:55.723
No. No.

39:56.021 --> 39:57.137
What? Jill?

40:03.856 --> 40:04.531
Jill?

40:07.262 --> 40:08.992
Jill, what is it?

40:17.222 --> 40:18.290
Better get...

40:19.217 --> 40:20.049
Denver...

40:20.348 --> 40:23.104
the WHO, every other health
department on alert.

40:24.447 --> 40:26.960
This is the
fucking 1918 Spanish Flu.

40:34.069 --> 40:34.882
Wes!

40:35.149 --> 40:38.526
Fortunately this Spanish Flu
is David and Jill's life's work.

40:38.636 --> 40:39.720
I'm well aware of that.

40:39.783 --> 40:41.950
That's why we were so quick
to identify it.

40:42.014 --> 40:44.676
So, hopefully we'll be able to
get a head start on the vaccine.

40:45.325 --> 40:48.784
The Spanish Flu
is extremely contagious.

40:48.894 --> 40:52.365
If not contained, it could turn
into a pandemic overnight.

40:52.443 --> 40:54.061
Can you contain it?

40:54.218 --> 40:57.878
Right now, there are 28 reported cases,
all confined to the Denver area.

40:58.067 --> 40:58.977
That's good.

40:59.307 --> 41:02.888
I think we should shut down
all access to the Denver area.

41:03.030 --> 41:04.506
Airport, highway.

41:04.569 --> 41:06.542
No, no.
That's politically impossible.

41:07.029 --> 41:09.683
Then we're just going to have
to hold our breath a couple of days,

41:09.809 --> 41:11.756
and see if it crops up
anywhere else.

41:11.866 --> 41:14.976
Caroline, do we have to
use the term Spanish Flu?

41:15.468 --> 41:17.395
It's the strain we've
identified.

41:17.474 --> 41:20.828
- Yes, I know. But it has such a...
- Devastating connotation?

41:20.891 --> 41:22.374
Yeah, that'd be it.

41:22.995 --> 41:24.880
I'll advise Denver accordingly.

41:24.959 --> 41:27.189
Thank you, Caroline,
and please keep me updated.

41:27.676 --> 41:28.524
I will.

41:29.850 --> 41:32.168
And I'm supposed to ease
your mind about Chiernegin?

41:32.634 --> 41:36.215
The Spanish Flu doesn't just
appear out of nowhere, Colin.

41:40.365 --> 41:42.718
He's out of Cape Town,
we think he's in the U.S.

41:42.859 --> 41:43.597
Oh shit.

41:43.990 --> 41:45.843
And that's all we know right now.

41:47.328 --> 41:48.796
What? What is it?

41:50.226 --> 41:52.817
There was an army 2 star general
that worked at Fort Egan.

41:52.974 --> 41:54.356
His name was Ablamar.

41:54.608 --> 41:56.932
Ablamar was
Hira Kahn's direct boss

41:57.042 --> 41:58.377
when she worked at the Pentagon.

41:58.487 --> 42:00.341
I'm pretty familiar
with her history.

42:00.435 --> 42:03.655
Before that he was a liaison to
the intelligence agency in Pakistan.

42:04.393 --> 42:05.964
Where are you going with this?

42:06.152 --> 42:08.320
Well, Miranda
came out of Egan.

42:09.875 --> 42:12.655
- You're thinking Hira?
- Well, we don't know yet.

42:14.508 --> 42:16.550
There were some issues
about her past.

42:18.152 --> 42:21.922
And she did seem
really familiar with Miranda.

42:22.048 --> 42:23.492
If Chiernegin got to her

42:23.696 --> 42:26.524
and she did cross a line,
a man like that would want her dead.

42:26.634 --> 42:28.079
He always covers his tracks.

42:28.436 --> 42:31.660
Why wouldn't he go
after David, or this entire lab?

42:31.732 --> 42:32.438
You're right. 

42:32.564 --> 42:35.946
I think it'd be a good idea that
we put some security around David.

42:57.285 --> 42:58.754
What are you...
what are you doing...?

42:59.524 --> 43:00.498
You don't believe in this.

43:03.906 --> 43:05.398
I don't know what I'm doing.

43:06.450 --> 43:07.833
Yes you do.

43:08.458 --> 43:10.877
Look at you.
Another one of our failures.

43:11.272 --> 43:12.215
Stop it.

43:20.173 --> 43:20.948
It killed you.

43:21.168 --> 43:23.587
It made me.
It gave my brother hope.

43:23.791 --> 43:25.377
It's wrong. It's all wrong.

43:25.487 --> 43:26.838
It could have worked.

43:26.948 --> 43:29.100
You have no idea
what I've done.

43:31.055 --> 43:32.885
You just wanted to
find an answer.

43:32.964 --> 43:34.738
What I wanted was a lot
different than what I did.

43:35.554 --> 43:36.654
So, fix it.

43:38.915 --> 43:41.617
David, you can fix it.

43:57.371 --> 43:58.894
Goodbye, Dr. Sandstrom.

44:06.659 --> 44:07.612
Bye, Mick.

44:22.447 --> 44:24.961
The CDC's widening
the quarantine area.

44:25.002 --> 44:27.552
This has doubled in just
the last 2 hours.

44:27.646 --> 44:30.269
They're turning the old stables and
airport into a quarantine centre.

44:30.342 --> 44:32.905
Denver proper is reporting
10 confirmed deaths,

44:33.031 --> 44:34.878
204 people in quarantine.

44:35.255 --> 44:38.082
Lakewood has 5 reported cases.
Aurora 7.

44:38.459 --> 44:39.175
Hi.

44:39.929 --> 44:41.261
Okay, here's what I got.

44:41.588 --> 44:43.058
These are David's notes,

44:43.096 --> 44:44.913
from what I can tell was the beginning

44:44.954 --> 44:47.493
when he first had
a line on the 1918 flu victim.

44:47.634 --> 44:50.442
He was working with a guy
named Joe Okalik in Nunavut,

44:50.520 --> 44:52.523
which makes sense because
the sample we worked on

44:52.621 --> 44:54.459
clearly came out
of the permafrost.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.783
How did a flu in Nunavut
end up in Denver, Colorado.

44:56.882 --> 44:57.920
I don't know,

44:58.003 --> 44:59.308
but more important than that
right now

44:59.418 --> 45:01.868
is we need to find the body he
exhumed and make sure it's contained.

45:02.005 --> 45:04.173
- Yeah, let's do it.
- I can't find any dig records

45:04.256 --> 45:06.257
- or permits anywhere.
- Can I take this?

45:06.299 --> 45:07.852
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Wes.

45:08.425 --> 45:09.801
That sounds like David.

45:09.843 --> 45:11.470
I've been trying to get in
touch with this Joe Okalik

45:11.552 --> 45:12.803
and he's not
answering his cell.

45:12.887 --> 45:14.763
Okay, go home,
pack your long johns

45:14.845 --> 45:16.388
and catch the next
flight up there.

45:16.430 --> 45:17.367
- Okay.
- Fuck.

45:17.606 --> 45:18.270
What?

45:18.358 --> 45:20.808
I don't know what's worse.
Thinking some terrorist released this flu

45:20.972 --> 45:23.321
or that the head scientist
from NorBAC did.

45:25.370 --> 45:26.002
Fuck.

45:28.929 --> 45:31.166
I know you wouldn't leave
if you didn't have to.

45:31.945 --> 45:33.315
I know that.

45:42.525 --> 45:44.976
You're off on a whole new adventure.

45:47.011 --> 45:49.142
And when you look back,

45:50.178 --> 45:52.012
I'll always be there.

45:55.504 --> 45:57.169
Goodnight, Gamelan.

46:19.511 --> 46:21.741
David, if you die

46:22.369 --> 46:23.846
I'm going to kill you.

47:04.476 --> 47:08.293
Joe, look, I need you to go out
and see if the body's still there.

47:09.424 --> 47:10.916
A male caller.

47:11.136 --> 47:12.221
Yeah, it's my boss.

47:12.305 --> 47:15.785
- They let you out?
- I've been trying to get in touch with him.

47:16.036 --> 47:17.858
- He's dead.
- Flu?

47:18.078 --> 47:19.900
Denver's already begun the
antiviral treatments

47:20.057 --> 47:21.727
but nothing seems to be working.

47:21.811 --> 47:24.505
- So, how did it get there?
- I caused it, Mayko.

47:25.194 --> 47:27.738
I let it out.
It's the same fucking flu.

47:27.979 --> 47:29.770
Bu the girl
she was sitting next to

47:30.068 --> 47:32.582
had contact with just about everyone
who's gotten sick.

47:33.314 --> 47:35.340
Daisy, I am so sorry.

47:36.587 --> 47:37.796
There's no hope?

47:39.382 --> 47:40.592
Just a corpse.

47:40.765 --> 47:42.162
Another fucking corpse.

47:42.492 --> 47:44.157
All I have are corpses.

47:45.116 --> 47:48.076
I buried my baby
and I buried my parents.

47:48.159 --> 47:51.429
What kind of person would want
to see another corpse?

47:51.587 --> 47:53.032
Do you think that's why
I'm pissed at you?

47:53.204 --> 47:54.038
I don't know.

47:54.121 --> 47:57.165
David, I am pissed at you because
we could have had a vaccine by now.

47:57.314 --> 47:59.167
People are dying David!

48:00.141 --> 48:01.916
You fucked up!
