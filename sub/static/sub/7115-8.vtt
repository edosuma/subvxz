WEBVTT

00:08.988 --> 00:11.087
Oh my God!

00:11.122 --> 00:14.284
I am so hot!

00:14.319 --> 00:18.148
Ain't that the truth.

00:18.182 --> 00:19.881
What's the temperature now?

00:19.915 --> 00:21.181
Well,

00:21.215 --> 00:23.414
According to my pear pad...

00:24.649 --> 00:26.047
Here in Hollywood,

00:26.081 --> 00:33.415
It is 103 degrees.

00:33.416 --> 00:34.715
Man, I hate sweating.

00:34.749 --> 00:36.248
I know.

00:36.282 --> 00:40.682
My arms feel like warm, wet ham.

00:40.716 --> 00:41.682
Hi.

00:41.716 --> 00:42.449
I'm really hot,

00:42.483 --> 00:45.015
But I'm still in a good mood.

00:45.049 --> 00:46.382
Robbie,

00:46.416 --> 00:47.749
You done with that water?

00:47.783 --> 00:48.682
No.

00:48.716 --> 00:49.582
Give it to me.

00:49.616 --> 00:56.082
All right.

00:56.116 --> 00:57.982
What?

00:58.016 --> 00:59.216
You're not sweating.

01:03.451 --> 01:05.884
Havin' fun there?

01:05.918 --> 01:08.485
How can you not be sweating?

01:08.519 --> 01:09.619
I don't sweat.

01:09.653 --> 01:10.818
Everyone sweats.

01:10.853 --> 01:11.552
Not Jade.

01:11.587 --> 01:13.387
Jade never sweats.

01:13.421 --> 01:13.853
What do mean,

01:13.888 --> 01:14.854
She never sweats?

01:14.888 --> 01:15.555
Sweating is gross,

01:15.589 --> 01:17.256
So I don't do it.

01:17.290 --> 01:17.889
So, what,

01:17.923 --> 01:20.424
You're just like cold-Blooded?

01:20.458 --> 01:23.058
Jade? Cold-Blooded?

01:23.093 --> 01:27.591
Hmmm, what a surprise.

01:29.025 --> 01:29.924
That witch got sunscreen

01:29.958 --> 01:30.891
In my eyes.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.458
Help me, Rob.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.659
It's okay. Don't fret.

01:35.694 --> 01:37.160
There you go.

01:37.194 --> 01:38.528
Oh, now my face

01:38.562 --> 01:41.262
Is gonna tan unevenly.

01:41.297 --> 01:44.431
What's up amigos, amigirls?

01:44.465 --> 01:46.432
What's all that money for?

01:46.466 --> 01:47.699
Me.

01:47.733 --> 01:48.766
I set up a kiddie pool

01:48.799 --> 01:49.232
Over there

01:49.266 --> 01:49.966
And I'm chargin' people

01:50.000 --> 01:52.234
Five bucks for five minutes.

01:52.268 --> 01:53.033
Sinjin!

01:53.068 --> 01:54.300
You got three more minutes.

01:54.335 --> 01:59.801
Okay.

02:03.236 --> 02:06.102
Is it true that sweat and pee

02:06.137 --> 02:08.902
Are like... Cousins?

02:08.937 --> 02:11.504
What now?

02:11.538 --> 02:12.437
Man, how long

02:12.472 --> 02:14.071
Is this heat wave gonna last?

02:14.105 --> 02:15.871
They say 'til Tuesday.

02:15.905 --> 02:19.306
Why would they say that?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.108
Wow, it's up to 106

02:21.142 --> 02:23.210
In the valley.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.544
Hey, check venice beach.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.012
Okay.

02:26.046 --> 02:30.149
Venice is only 91 degrees.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.884
Oh, let's go to venice.

02:32.918 --> 02:33.918
You guys wanna?

02:33.952 --> 02:35.451
What, blow off school?

02:35.486 --> 02:36.919
I can get with that.

02:36.953 --> 02:38.420
I meant Saturday.

02:38.454 --> 02:38.854
I could borrow

02:38.888 --> 02:39.688
My uncle's pickup,

02:39.722 --> 02:40.455
Hook it up my R.V.

02:40.490 --> 02:41.323
And we could all hit the beach.

02:41.357 --> 02:41.856
Let's do it.

02:41.891 --> 02:42.390
Well, that sounds

02:42.425 --> 02:43.525
Really cool, man.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.027
The beach? I am so in.

02:45.061 --> 02:45.661
No, no, no, no, no.

02:45.695 --> 02:46.094
Stay away.

02:46.128 --> 02:46.394
No.

02:46.429 --> 02:46.928
Wait a second...

02:46.963 --> 02:47.896
I can't wait.

02:49.865 --> 02:55.234
No one likes you.

02:55.268 --> 02:58.968
Hey! Hey, Sinjin.

02:59.002 --> 02:59.768
He's face down

02:59.803 --> 03:01.804
In the kiddie pool.

03:01.839 --> 03:03.041
Yep.

03:03.075 --> 03:03.743
It's cool.

03:03.778 --> 03:05.912
He's still got two minutes left.

03:05.946 --> 03:12.450
No.

03:12.485 --> 03:14.119
Are you okay?

03:16.321 --> 03:17.455
Maybe you should give him

03:17.489 --> 03:19.891
Mouth to mouth.

03:19.926 --> 03:21.996
He's all right.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
VICTORIOUS S1 - E8

04:56.452 --> 04:59.352
Gotta pee, gotta pee...

04:59.421 --> 05:00.654
Hurry back!

05:00.689 --> 05:03.056
Kay-Kay!

05:03.090 --> 05:03.623
She has the bladder

05:03.657 --> 05:08.594
Of a squirrel.

05:08.628 --> 05:11.696
Who's ready for beach fun?

05:11.730 --> 05:14.031
Beck, this R.V. is so cool.

05:14.065 --> 05:14.698
Oh, thanks!

05:14.732 --> 05:16.166
And you like, live in this?

05:16.200 --> 05:17.200
Yeah, well,

05:17.234 --> 05:19.368
Parked in my parents' driveway.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.836
At least you have parents.

05:21.871 --> 05:24.539
Hey, some things are private.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.444
I know.

05:28.479 --> 05:29.678
Hey, how come

05:29.713 --> 05:30.312
All these windows

05:30.347 --> 05:31.446
Are tinted so dark?

05:31.481 --> 05:32.147
'Cause my dad bought it

05:32.181 --> 05:33.381
From a rapper.

05:33.416 --> 05:33.882
All the windows

05:33.916 --> 05:35.716
Are made of bulletproof glass.

05:35.751 --> 05:36.784
What rapper?

05:36.818 --> 05:37.851
Fat biscuit.

05:37.885 --> 05:38.885
The fat biscuit?

05:38.919 --> 05:39.886
Oh, my gosh.

05:39.920 --> 05:40.286
You know,

05:40.320 --> 05:42.287
I heard he's thin now.

05:42.321 --> 05:42.720
Yeah,

05:42.755 --> 05:44.121
He had that stomach surgery.

05:44.156 --> 05:47.525
Aw, good for fat biscuit.

05:47.559 --> 05:48.859
Hey.

05:48.893 --> 05:49.726
What?

05:49.761 --> 05:50.394
Does it worry you

05:50.428 --> 05:51.628
That you never sweat?

05:51.663 --> 05:52.429
No.

05:52.464 --> 05:53.197
But what if one day,

05:53.232 --> 05:54.099
All your sweat, like,

05:54.133 --> 05:54.733
Builds up inside,

05:54.767 --> 05:57.235
And you just explode?

05:57.269 --> 06:00.438
I would love that.

06:00.472 --> 06:01.539
All right, it's startin'

06:01.573 --> 06:02.573
To get hot in here.

06:02.608 --> 06:03.641
Yeah, let's go.

06:03.675 --> 06:05.543
Let's hit that beach!

06:05.577 --> 06:09.280
This way, people.

06:09.314 --> 06:10.748
What's wrong?

06:10.782 --> 06:11.315
I don't know.

06:11.349 --> 06:24.128
The door won't open.

06:24.162 --> 06:26.029
Man, I love the beach!

06:28.765 --> 06:29.365
You got the sunscreen

06:29.399 --> 06:31.667
For daddy?

06:31.701 --> 06:36.340
Come on.

06:36.374 --> 06:37.507
Just open it.

06:37.542 --> 06:38.175
Something's blocking

06:38.209 --> 06:39.810
The door.

06:39.844 --> 06:40.811
Oh, man!

06:40.845 --> 06:42.178
Some idiot parked a huge R.V.

06:42.213 --> 06:43.346
Right next to us.

06:43.381 --> 06:43.813
Whatever,

06:43.848 --> 06:45.248
Let's just go out the back door.

06:45.283 --> 06:47.216
There is no back door.

06:47.251 --> 06:51.354
Well, that's stupid.

06:51.389 --> 06:53.223
I'm getting very hot now.

06:53.257 --> 06:54.524
Will somebody open a window?

06:54.558 --> 06:55.558
The windows are bulletproof.

06:55.593 --> 06:57.127
They don't open.

06:57.161 --> 06:57.961
Aw, thanks a lot,

06:57.995 --> 06:58.928
Fat biscuit.

06:58.963 --> 07:00.964
What?

07:00.998 --> 07:01.731
I meant the rapper

07:01.766 --> 07:02.632
From whom Beck's daddy

07:02.667 --> 07:05.201
Purchased this vehicle!

07:05.236 --> 07:06.369
I'm getting hotter.

07:06.403 --> 07:07.971
Just push on the door.

07:08.005 --> 07:08.638
I can't push

07:08.672 --> 07:10.173
A 7,000-Pound R.V.

07:10.207 --> 07:11.341
Out of the way.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.576
Then push harder!

07:13.611 --> 07:16.446
That doesn't make any sense.

07:16.481 --> 07:17.614
All right, all right!

07:17.648 --> 07:19.582
Let's not bug out.

07:19.617 --> 07:20.283
Dude, nobody knows

07:20.317 --> 07:20.783
We're trapped

07:20.817 --> 07:22.885
In this toaster oven.

07:22.919 --> 07:23.385
Cat just went

07:23.420 --> 07:24.119
To the bathroom.

07:24.154 --> 07:24.720
She's gonna be back

07:24.754 --> 07:25.888
In a few minutes,

07:25.922 --> 07:26.688
And then she can start

07:26.723 --> 07:27.456
Beck's truck

07:27.490 --> 07:28.156
And then pull us forward

07:28.191 --> 07:28.957
So we can get out.

07:28.992 --> 07:30.626
Good point.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.461
Okay.

07:32.495 --> 07:33.195
I freaked out. I'm sorry.

07:33.229 --> 07:36.832
Come on. It's all good.

07:43.373 --> 07:44.206
Oh, there's some in there

07:44.240 --> 07:45.107
For you, man.

07:45.141 --> 07:45.941
Thanks, bro.

07:45.975 --> 07:47.042
Yeah. No problem.

07:47.076 --> 07:48.009
Yeah.

07:48.044 --> 07:49.744
Hey.

07:49.779 --> 07:50.345
Hi.

07:50.379 --> 07:51.212
'Sup?

07:51.247 --> 07:51.846
What's that song

07:51.880 --> 07:52.981
You're playing?

07:53.015 --> 07:54.048
I'm not sure.

07:54.083 --> 07:58.686
Well, it's really cool.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.286
Do you wanna hang out

07:59.321 --> 07:59.820
With us?

08:00.355 --> 08:00.955
Oh, I can't.

08:00.989 --> 08:01.488
I have to get back

08:01.523 --> 08:02.256
To my friends.

08:02.290 --> 08:03.524
Oh, come on.

08:03.558 --> 08:04.057
Just hang with us

08:04.092 --> 08:05.258
For a few minutes.

08:05.293 --> 08:06.059
Please.

08:06.093 --> 08:07.093
Come on.

08:07.128 --> 08:08.228
Okay.

08:15.636 --> 08:18.271
Where is Cat?

08:18.305 --> 08:18.938
She's been gone

08:18.973 --> 08:20.173
For 20 minutes.

08:20.207 --> 08:20.940
The girl only weighs

08:20.975 --> 08:21.774
90 pounds.

08:21.808 --> 08:24.843
How much pee can she hold?

08:24.877 --> 08:26.011
That's it. I'm calling her.

08:26.045 --> 08:27.379
What's Cat's number?

08:27.413 --> 08:28.880
I already tried.

08:28.914 --> 08:30.314
No signal.

08:30.349 --> 08:31.615
Oh man, I told you all

08:31.650 --> 08:35.818
Not to get f-Mobile.

08:35.852 --> 08:38.486
Well, where's your phone?

08:38.520 --> 08:39.455
I left it in my pants

08:39.490 --> 08:41.260
And my grandma washed it.

08:41.294 --> 08:44.430
All my contacts, gone.

08:44.464 --> 08:45.398
Well, can we at least turn on

08:45.432 --> 08:46.599
The air conditioning?

08:46.633 --> 08:47.633
The a.C. Doesn't work

08:47.667 --> 08:49.368
Unless the truck is running.

08:49.402 --> 08:50.803
Then go start the truck.

08:50.837 --> 08:53.038
I can't get out.

08:53.073 --> 08:55.174
Why did you invite me here?

08:55.208 --> 08:55.774
We didn't!

08:55.809 --> 08:56.608
You invited yourself!

08:56.643 --> 08:59.411
No one likes you.

08:59.446 --> 09:01.847
I'm feelin' very hot now!

09:01.881 --> 09:03.649
You guys,

09:03.683 --> 09:07.786
It's 102 degrees in here.

09:07.821 --> 09:09.521
I need a cold drink.

09:09.556 --> 09:11.156
Me too.

09:11.191 --> 09:12.424
Where are they?

09:12.458 --> 09:15.927
In the truck.

09:15.961 --> 09:18.362
What are we gonna do?

09:18.397 --> 09:21.399
Cat!

09:21.433 --> 09:33.174
Cat!

09:44.818 --> 09:46.184
Look out, look out.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.252
Gonna get you.

09:47.286 --> 09:50.755
She's right behind you.

09:50.789 --> 09:53.424
It's so cold! It's so cold!

09:53.458 --> 09:54.891
She's not even wet.

09:54.926 --> 09:58.158
It's so hot!

10:09.152 --> 10:10.051
I can't believe

10:10.085 --> 10:12.083
Cat's not back yet.

10:12.118 --> 10:15.753
How hot is it in here now?

10:17.287 --> 10:22.123
107 degrees.

10:22.158 --> 10:23.191
For so many years,

10:23.225 --> 10:24.625
I've prayed every night

10:24.660 --> 10:27.027
To be hotter.

10:27.062 --> 10:30.897
This isn't what I meant!

10:30.932 --> 10:32.065
There's parts of me sweatin'

10:32.100 --> 10:35.738
That I didn't know could sweat.

10:35.772 --> 10:39.140
Oh my God, I forgot.

10:39.174 --> 10:41.509
What?

10:41.543 --> 10:44.111
I brought a fan,

10:44.146 --> 10:45.813
A battery-Powered fan.

10:45.847 --> 10:46.613
Get out.

10:46.648 --> 10:50.049
Come on.

10:50.084 --> 10:54.253
Here it is.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.755
Oh, stop.

10:56.789 --> 10:57.956
That's it?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.290
That's your fan?

10:59.325 --> 11:00.758
Yeah.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.060
It's not big.

11:03.094 --> 11:05.963
It's an embarrassment.

11:05.997 --> 11:08.498
You teased us.

11:08.532 --> 11:10.967
Okay. Okay, fine.

11:11.001 --> 11:11.433
Then I guess

11:11.468 --> 11:12.501
I just won't turn it on.

11:12.535 --> 11:13.669
No, no.

11:13.703 --> 11:14.703
Turn it on.

11:14.737 --> 11:15.370
Now you like my tiny fan,

11:15.404 --> 11:17.805
Don't you?

11:29.781 --> 11:34.317
At least it oscillates.

11:34.351 --> 11:38.920
Um, I'm sll not happy

11:38.955 --> 11:40.856
I'm so hot.

11:40.890 --> 11:43.492
Where could Cat be?

11:43.526 --> 11:46.328
I hope she's okay.

11:54.706 --> 11:56.107
Hey. Shaved ice.

11:56.141 --> 11:59.043
Yay, I love shaved ice.

11:59.078 --> 12:00.211
We'll take five, please.

12:00.246 --> 12:01.613
Sure. Flavors?

12:01.647 --> 12:03.849
What flavor do you like?

12:03.883 --> 12:07.819
You pick for me.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.387
Cherry for the lady.

12:09.421 --> 12:13.023
Yay, that's my fave.

12:13.057 --> 12:14.992
One cherry.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.126
Thank you.

12:16.161 --> 12:17.361
I'll take lime.

12:17.396 --> 12:18.129
Grape.

12:18.163 --> 12:19.130
Orange.

12:19.164 --> 12:21.932
Ah, brain freeze.

12:35.778 --> 12:38.547
It's slowing down.

12:43.955 --> 12:48.091
No! Come on, fan!

12:48.125 --> 12:49.292
Work, work! Spin!

12:49.327 --> 12:50.894
Robbie, Robbie stop.

12:50.928 --> 12:52.028
Roie, robb stop it.

12:52.062 --> 12:52.962
No, I need it. I need it.

12:52.997 --> 12:53.730
He batteries are dead.

12:53.764 --> 12:54.331
Robbie stop.

12:54.365 --> 12:55.465
Oscillate! Spin!

12:55.499 --> 13:01.670
It's over.

13:01.705 --> 13:05.240
I'm extremely hot now

13:05.274 --> 13:06.441
We've got to get out

13:06.475 --> 13:09.210
Of this stupid R.V.

13:09.245 --> 13:12.480
Yeah, offense.

13:12.515 --> 13:14.549
We at least have to find

13:14.583 --> 13:18.520
Something to drink.

13:21.657 --> 13:23.524
Your fish tank.

13:23.559 --> 13:26.260
Oh, yeah!

13:26.294 --> 13:28.428
I forgot about my fish tank.

13:28.462 --> 13:28.962
Wait.

13:28.996 --> 13:32.031
We're gonna drink fish water?

13:32.065 --> 13:33.699
Beats dyin' of thirst.

13:33.734 --> 13:34.333
When was the last time

13:34.368 --> 13:35.668
You cleaned it?

13:35.702 --> 13:37.469
You're supposed to clean it?

13:37.503 --> 13:38.670
Oh, come on!

13:38.704 --> 13:39.270
We can't drink

13:39.305 --> 13:41.072
Dirty fish water.

13:41.106 --> 13:42.072
Well, if we don't drink

13:42.107 --> 13:42.873
Somethin',

13:42.908 --> 13:43.941
We'rall gonna be just...

13:43.975 --> 13:45.508
Wait.

13:45.543 --> 13:50.713
Trina, what are you doing?

13:50.747 --> 13:52.748
What do you mean?

13:52.782 --> 13:54.884
Why was your head

13:54.918 --> 13:58.189
In your bag?

13:58.224 --> 14:02.360
It's cool in there.

14:02.395 --> 14:04.762
I heard you swallow.

14:04.797 --> 14:05.530
Gimme the bag.

14:05.564 --> 14:06.297
No!

14:06.331 --> 14:09.371
Give me the bag!

14:09.405 --> 14:18.051
No! No! You can't have it.

14:18.085 --> 14:29.495
No! No! You can't have it.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.897
Water! She has water!

14:31.932 --> 14:34.334
Give it back!

14:34.368 --> 14:35.535
You had water

14:35.569 --> 14:37.136
This entire time

14:37.171 --> 14:37.870
And didn't share

14:37.905 --> 14:39.071
With the rest of us?

14:39.106 --> 14:39.739
If I shared it,

14:39.773 --> 14:40.640
I wouldn't have had as much

14:40.674 --> 14:43.009
For me.

14:43.043 --> 14:43.642
There's only like

14:43.677 --> 14:45.144
One swallow left.

14:45.178 --> 14:45.811
I want it.

14:45.846 --> 14:49.215
No. We will share it.

14:49.249 --> 14:50.182
There's barely enough

14:50.217 --> 14:52.718
To fill up the cap.

14:52.752 --> 14:53.285
Then we will share

14:53.320 --> 14:55.220
One capful.

14:55.255 --> 14:56.822
Okay, we'll share it.

14:56.856 --> 15:02.928
You get nothing.

15:19.812 --> 15:21.914
Just keep your hands steady.

15:21.949 --> 15:23.282
Steady?

15:23.317 --> 15:38.831
Like this...

15:46.073 --> 15:49.175
All right. No sipping.

15:49.209 --> 16:01.519
Everyone gets one tongue dip.

16:01.553 --> 16:05.023
Oh, that's refreshing.

16:05.057 --> 16:13.532
Here.

16:23.542 --> 16:31.150
No!

16:31.184 --> 16:32.150
It's empty.

16:32.185 --> 16:34.119
Well, I'm sorry.

16:34.153 --> 16:42.661
I couldn't help myself!

16:42.695 --> 16:43.528
Okay.

16:43.563 --> 16:44.229
Okay, something's dripping

16:44.263 --> 16:45.397
On me.

16:45.431 --> 16:50.635
Something's dripping on me.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.704
Nothing's dripping.

16:52.738 --> 16:54.673
Yes, look on my arm.

16:54.707 --> 16:58.843
See? And on my forehead.

16:58.878 --> 16:59.411
What's going on?

16:59.445 --> 17:01.147
What's happening?

17:01.181 --> 17:02.381
You're sweating.

17:02.415 --> 17:04.016
No. No, I'm not.

17:04.050 --> 17:04.950
I don't sweat.

17:04.984 --> 17:06.852
I am not sweating.

17:06.886 --> 17:07.286
Look at me.

17:07.319 --> 17:07.819
No.

17:07.854 --> 17:08.387
Look at me.

17:08.421 --> 17:08.686
No.

17:08.722 --> 17:09.320
Look at me!

17:09.356 --> 17:12.558
What?

17:12.592 --> 17:24.368
You're sweating.

17:24.404 --> 17:26.371
We gotta get out of here.

17:26.406 --> 17:28.740
Yeah, thank you,

17:28.775 --> 17:33.011
Catherine obvious.

17:33.046 --> 17:34.279
What?

17:34.313 --> 17:35.080
I said, "thank you,

17:35.114 --> 17:36.915
Catherine obvious."

17:36.949 --> 17:37.415
Did she say

17:37.450 --> 17:41.352
Catherine obvious?

17:41.387 --> 17:44.489
It's captain obvious.

17:45.991 --> 17:46.557
The expression is

17:46.592 --> 17:50.695
"Thank you, captain obvious."

17:50.729 --> 17:52.730
It's not catherine?

17:52.765 --> 17:54.098
No.

17:54.133 --> 17:57.435
Who would catherine be?

17:57.469 --> 18:06.577
Catherine can be a captain.

18:06.612 --> 18:08.679
You spun a beautiful pot.

18:08.714 --> 18:11.048
You helped me spin it.

18:11.082 --> 18:13.617
Later, we'll glaze it.

18:13.652 --> 18:16.053
Thank you.

18:16.087 --> 18:17.121
But I really should be

18:17.155 --> 18:18.455
Getting back to my friends.

18:18.490 --> 18:20.090
Oh, you can't leave now.

18:20.125 --> 18:21.959
Paul just made tuna tartare.

18:21.993 --> 18:22.793
We caught the tuna

18:22.827 --> 18:23.927
This morning.

18:23.962 --> 18:24.528
You gotta stay

18:24.562 --> 18:27.764
For the tuna tartare.

18:27.798 --> 18:32.168
Have some tuna.

18:32.202 --> 18:38.274
Okay.

18:38.309 --> 18:39.008
Cheers.

18:50.355 --> 18:53.556
Okay. It's official.

18:53.591 --> 18:54.523
I have achieved

18:54.558 --> 18:59.193
Maximum hottitude.

19:02.597 --> 19:07.067
I've never been this thirsty.

19:07.102 --> 19:07.701
For the first time

19:07.736 --> 19:09.803
In my life,

19:09.837 --> 19:17.311
My tongue isn't moist.

19:17.346 --> 19:21.382
These fish mock me.

19:21.416 --> 19:22.917
How dare they swim around,

19:22.951 --> 19:26.854
Enjoying that filthy water?

19:26.888 --> 19:27.655
I'm gonna drink

19:27.689 --> 19:29.490
That filthy water.

19:29.524 --> 19:30.190
No.

19:30.225 --> 19:30.791
No, Robbie.

19:30.825 --> 19:31.859
Robbie, don't.

19:31.893 --> 19:32.392
I need to do it.

19:32.427 --> 19:33.226
Don't do it, Robbie.

19:33.261 --> 19:38.065
What choice do I have?

19:38.099 --> 19:52.144
It's his call.

19:52.179 --> 19:56.215
Well?

19:56.250 --> 20:03.623
Oh, no! No. No.

20:03.657 --> 20:10.196
That's my bag.

20:10.230 --> 20:17.036
Don't drink the fish water.

20:17.071 --> 20:18.972
What do we do?

20:19.006 --> 20:23.710
I don't know.

20:23.745 --> 20:26.079
When I was a little boy,

20:26.114 --> 20:28.148
My grandma,

20:28.183 --> 20:31.518
Before she lost her mind,

20:31.553 --> 20:36.790
She used to say to me, "Andre,

20:36.824 --> 20:39.393
"No matter how bad things get,

20:39.427 --> 20:41.495
"You can always make it better

20:41.529 --> 20:45.132
By singin' a song."

20:45.166 --> 20:50.410
That's so stupid.

20:57.878 --> 21:00.079
* you don't have to be afraid *

21:00.113 --> 21:06.284
* to put your dreams in action *

21:06.318 --> 21:08.186
* you're never gonna fade *

21:08.220 --> 21:08.987
* you'll be *

21:09.021 --> 21:14.459
* the main attraction *

21:14.494 --> 21:17.764
* not a fantasy *

21:17.798 --> 21:20.800
* just remember me *

21:20.834 --> 21:25.535
* when it turns out right *

21:25.569 --> 21:27.003
* 'cause you know *

21:27.037 --> 21:29.905
* that if you live in your... *

21:29.939 --> 21:32.074
Hi, everyone!

21:53.959 --> 21:55.526
You guys really missed me.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.527
Jade, you're all sweaty.

21:57.562 --> 22:00.330
Never speak of it!

22:00.364 --> 22:01.831
What happened?

22:01.865 --> 22:03.366
We were trapped in there.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.466
For hours.

22:04.501 --> 22:06.234
Hope you had a nice pee.

22:06.269 --> 22:06.868
Trapped?

22:06.903 --> 22:07.469
Why didn't you guys

22:07.503 --> 22:08.870
Just open the door?

22:08.904 --> 22:10.905
'Cuz there's a gigantic R.V.

22:10.940 --> 22:15.543
Parked right...

22:15.577 --> 22:16.243
I guess they left

22:16.278 --> 22:18.746
And we didn't even know.

22:18.780 --> 22:21.648
Who cares? It's over.

22:21.682 --> 22:24.784
I drank fish water.

22:24.819 --> 22:26.052
It's all right.

22:26.087 --> 22:26.619
Come on, guys.

22:26.653 --> 22:29.421
It's only 4:30,

22:29.456 --> 22:30.289
And there's a large

22:30.323 --> 22:32.357
Pacific ocean right over there.

22:32.391 --> 22:41.930
Let's enjoy that ocean.

22:41.931 --> 22:43.265
Hey, fat biscuit.

22:43.299 --> 22:44.065
What's up?

22:44.100 --> 22:45.867
Isn't this your old R.V.?

22:45.901 --> 22:48.703
With the bulletproof windows?

22:48.737 --> 22:51.205
Yeah. I think it is.

22:51.239 --> 22:54.042
We had some times in there.

22:54.076 --> 22:55.344
Don't talk about it.
