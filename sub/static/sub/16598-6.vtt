00:01.335 --> 00:04.205
Previously on The Exorcist...
You're not Jessica.

00:04.238 --> 00:07.108
Give me your hands.
It's time for you to pray.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.043
MARCUS:
Tomas!

00:10.744 --> 00:12.080
Father Tomas,

00:12.113 --> 00:14.148
from St. Anthony.
How do you know that?

00:14.182 --> 00:16.084
Who do you think sends you
all those wonderful

00:16.117 --> 00:18.986
fundraising letters you throw
straight into the trash?

00:19.019 --> 00:20.988
It's a shame you got yourself
kicked out of Chicago.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.656
You have some friends
in this town.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.058
So, how do you know Bennett?
I assume you're making

00:24.092 --> 00:26.094
a connection to the
whole Englewood murders.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.562
Yeah, there were
organs harvested.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.898
CHERRY: Those organs-- they're
only used for one reason.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.166
MARCUS: A summoning.
ANGELA: No!

00:32.200 --> 00:34.235
You don't understand.
You can't stop this!

00:34.268 --> 00:35.436
No!
Please, this is
for her own good.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.105
(sirens wailing)

00:37.138 --> 00:39.940
MAN (over radio):
724, this is dispatch, over.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.875
(men screaming)

00:46.780 --> 00:48.716
ANGELA: They called it
a nervous breakdown.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.618
But I... I ran away
from all that.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.220
I never told my mother
where I went.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.622
I never saw her again.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.590
My name is Regan MacNeil.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.892
I'm Chris MacNeil.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.728
I've come to see my daughter.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.131
*

01:06.234 --> 01:07.435
(applause)

01:07.468 --> 01:09.303
It's a terrifying book.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.938
I couldn't sleep
after I read it.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.740
Ha! Try living
through it.

01:12.773 --> 01:16.244
For those just tuning in, we're
with actress Chris MacNeil,

01:16.277 --> 01:18.312
talking about
Ms. MacNeil's new book,

01:18.346 --> 01:21.815
The Devil in My Daughter,
which she says

01:21.849 --> 01:23.917
is the true story
of a time several years ago

01:23.951 --> 01:27.921
when young Regan
was possessed by a demon.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.491
Now, Regan, I'd like to ask
you a few questions, if I may.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.561
Although your mother has warned
me that you're a little shy.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.396
I'm quiet.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.565
Not shy.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.200
There's a difference.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.071
What happened to you
in Georgetown?

01:44.104 --> 01:47.408
Since most of our viewers don't
believe in demon possession,

01:47.441 --> 01:49.443
can you help me-- help us--

01:49.477 --> 01:52.079
understand what
you went through?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.981
I-I don't really remember it.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.082
You do.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.618
She does.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.020
I... I remember that

02:00.053 --> 02:04.024
I couldn't control my body
sometimes.

02:04.057 --> 02:07.428
There was just this voice.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.864
It kept asking me
to come closer.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.900
And when I did...

02:18.306 --> 02:20.140
That's it.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.142
That's all I remember.

02:22.176 --> 02:25.045
Regan, has it occurred
to you that there could be

02:25.078 --> 02:26.980
another explanation
for those memories?

02:27.014 --> 02:28.849
Maybe your mind
is playing tricks on you.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.117
Look, buddy,
I was there.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.386
No, I'm positive it was real.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.290
Regan, do you think
you'll ever be capable

02:36.324 --> 02:38.058
of having a normal life?

02:38.091 --> 02:40.194
What do you mean?
Well, let's say
you go to college

02:40.228 --> 02:42.696
in a few years. You get there,
you tell everyone,

02:42.730 --> 02:44.465
"I'm Regan MacNeil."

02:44.498 --> 02:46.334
Are you worried
that they'll all say,

02:46.367 --> 02:48.902
"My God,
it's the demon girl"?

02:48.936 --> 02:50.838
Do you think
this is a story

02:50.871 --> 02:52.139
that's going
to follow you around

02:52.172 --> 02:54.208
for the rest
of your life?

02:56.877 --> 02:58.379
Regan?

03:00.848 --> 03:02.350
Regan?

03:06.387 --> 03:08.389
*

03:38.886 --> 03:41.722
ANGELA: I can't believe
you let her in the house.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.691
HENRY: She just showed up here.
What was I supposed to do?

03:43.724 --> 03:44.925
She seems like...
So,

03:44.958 --> 03:47.094
you're my grandmother.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.362
Ooh. (chuckles softly)

03:48.396 --> 03:49.897
That word.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.733
Um, maybe...
Well, I don't know.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.603
Would you like
to call me Nana?

03:55.636 --> 03:58.739
Or maybe together we could
come up with something cute.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.108
I'll think about that.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.080
You know who you look like?

04:07.114 --> 04:08.982
Me. (chuckles)

04:09.016 --> 04:10.618
Do people ever say that to you?

04:10.651 --> 04:13.787
That you look like
a young Chris MacNeil?

04:13.821 --> 04:15.956
No, not really.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.458
Well, you do.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.661
You have my teeth, exactly.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.896
And if you smiled,
we could see 'em.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.733
(door slams)
ANGELA: You don't think
I wanted to tell you?

04:25.766 --> 04:26.734
You told me she was dead.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.836
She was. To me.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.738
And I know
that doesn't make it right.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.273
I'm wondering if any of it
was the truth.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.108
Any... any of this.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.610
Henry.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.279
Not to get all Oprah
in the first hour, but...

04:39.313 --> 04:41.582
did you ever
try to find us?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.083
Or find Mom?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.686
I went through three
private detectives.

04:45.719 --> 04:49.022
Finally, they tracked her down.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.591
But she made it very clear

04:50.624 --> 04:53.361
that she still wanted
nothing to do with me.

04:54.395 --> 04:57.665
But now, I have a...

04:57.698 --> 05:01.435
a Web service thingy that

05:01.469 --> 05:03.471
lets me know if
anything happens to her.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.038
And I saw Casey's face.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.808
And I listened to your mother

05:07.841 --> 05:10.110
say that she wanted help
finding her.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.714
So... here I am.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.215
ANGELA:
You don't know what was like

05:15.248 --> 05:16.350
to live with that woman.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.285
To live in her fishbowl,

05:18.318 --> 05:19.853
to meet somebody
for the first time

05:19.887 --> 05:22.623
and-and see that pity
in their eyes.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.626
And that makes it okay?
No. But I made a choice.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.161
And I had to live with it
every day.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.530
Regan?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.565
That's your name?

05:31.599 --> 05:34.167
What is that?

05:34.201 --> 05:35.803
Who are you?

05:35.836 --> 05:38.071
KAT:
The possession--

05:38.105 --> 05:41.409
Mom's-- was it...

05:41.442 --> 05:44.011
was it like now,

05:44.044 --> 05:45.546
like with Casey?

05:49.517 --> 05:52.085
I hope not.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.690
I'm the one
who called the police.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.660
Casey wouldn't be out on
the streets right now if I...

05:59.693 --> 06:03.431
Stop. No, stop.
This is not your fault.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.666
HENRY: She can stay with us
for a few days until this ends.
ANGELA: No.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.501
Yes, yes.
No, that woman
cannot stay here.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.370
You don't get to make
that decision.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.205
This is not about you.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.742
This is about our little girl,
who is missing.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.544
Do you think I don't
remember that every second?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.378
If that woman

06:18.412 --> 06:21.214
can help us get Casey back
because she's Chris MacNeil--

06:21.248 --> 06:22.883
so crazy--

06:22.916 --> 06:25.018
if there's even a chance,
we're gonna take it.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.120
I'll stay in a hotel.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.121
I don't want
to be a bother.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.389
You can stay right here.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.692
Isn't that right, Ange?

06:31.725 --> 06:34.695
Hey, Kit Kat, do you mind giving
up your bed for a few nights?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.196
KAT: Yeah.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.865
Sure.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.633
You want to show
your grandmother upstairs?

06:39.667 --> 06:40.734
Chris.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.604
We're... calling her Chris.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.479
REPORTER: Good morning.
Our top local story:

06:51.512 --> 06:54.081
police and volunteers have
fanned out across Chicago

06:54.114 --> 06:56.950
searching for Casey Rance,
the 19-year-old woman

06:56.984 --> 06:58.886
who went missing last night
after a crash

06:58.919 --> 07:01.889
that left two paramedics dead.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.291
(indistinct conversations)

07:07.327 --> 07:09.830
Hey, let me give you a hand
with that, Father.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.832
Thank you.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.471
Okay, you good?

07:17.505 --> 07:19.339
Yeah.
Okay.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.944
(indistinct chatter)

07:31.184 --> 07:32.786
Why don't I take
the 14th District?

07:32.820 --> 07:34.421
Good.
Okay.

07:34.454 --> 07:38.025
(rapid, overlapping whispers)

07:43.797 --> 07:44.765
How can I help?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.501
You can stop hovering.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.638
Uh, Tara, can you
show Ms. MacNeil

07:50.671 --> 07:51.972
how to use the copy machine?

07:52.005 --> 07:53.674
Um, sure.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.442
This way.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.545
I-I know this is
a rotten time to say this,

07:57.578 --> 07:59.146
but I'm a huge fan of yours.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.781
Oh, aren't you sweet?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.816
What's your name?
Tara.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.386
(indistinct chatter)

08:08.488 --> 08:10.624
I'm sorry.

08:10.658 --> 08:13.460
You let us walk into that room
with incomplete information.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.828
Now two men are dead.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.830
You lied.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.866
What are the police
telling you?

08:18.899 --> 08:20.668
That there was someone else.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.503
An accomplice, a kidnapper.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.138
'Cause they think
there's no way

08:25.172 --> 08:26.473
a restrained, sedated girl

08:26.506 --> 08:28.241
could have done what she did.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.710
What's gonna happen to her?

08:29.743 --> 08:32.680
Possession is like...

08:32.713 --> 08:34.381
a virus.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.016
Well, you know this.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.517
The more aggressive
the attack,

08:37.551 --> 08:39.319
the more damage it
does to the body.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.521
It'll force her to submit.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.857
And when that happens?

08:43.891 --> 08:45.492
A union

08:45.525 --> 08:46.894
of demon and host,

08:46.927 --> 08:49.162
two entities becoming one.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.298
Integration.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.735
Integration is said to be...

08:54.768 --> 08:56.036
permanent.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.271
"Permanent"?

08:58.305 --> 09:00.407
The soul is destroyed,
so even if you

09:00.440 --> 09:02.576
performed an exorcism,
it wouldn't matter.

09:02.610 --> 09:05.212
Are you saying she's gonna die?

09:05.245 --> 09:08.515
I'm saying if we don't
find her soon...

09:08.548 --> 09:10.918
there won't be anything
left to save.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.553
You can't give up on her.

09:13.587 --> 09:16.523
No one will give up on her.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.526
ANGELA:
Father, when the same thing
happened to me,

09:19.559 --> 09:22.362
you'd have thought
there was none of me left.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.365
But I was still in there.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.301
Is there anything
that you remember

09:28.335 --> 09:29.937
that could be of help to us?

09:35.508 --> 09:37.144
Hey, you know, well, you have
a good think about that,

09:37.177 --> 09:38.511
'cause we've really
got the time.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.055
You could have shown
more compassion for her.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.256
You can apologize for me.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.891
Where are you going?
To hunt.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.293
"Hunt"? What do you mean, hunt?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.929
Demons disrupt
the natural order.

09:55.963 --> 09:59.767
Strange flocking behavior--
birds, dogs, people.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.234
What I need is a
bloody police scanner.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.469
What can I do?

10:02.502 --> 10:03.671
Nothing.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.839
Because I made one mistake?

10:05.873 --> 10:06.974
Yeah.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.809
'Cause you made a mistake.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.778
It won't happen again.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.512
You're right there.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.948
How I envy you, Tomas.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.616
You've got a family, a parish,

10:16.650 --> 10:18.118
a woman that you love.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.486
(whispers):
Please...

10:19.519 --> 10:21.354
Keep your voice down.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.956
You're a good man.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.492
A good priest.

10:25.525 --> 10:28.128
But you've got too much to lose.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.563
You can never be an exorcist.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.668
Well, I'm gonna hunt, too.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.103
Only I'll have
a hundred volunteers

10:36.136 --> 10:37.537
and half the Chicago police.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.239
Bully for you.

10:44.712 --> 10:48.181
The kidnapping of Casey Rance
has shaken our city.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.017
But this case
is receiving

10:50.050 --> 10:52.119
the full attention
of my department.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.553
The person or persons

10:53.586 --> 10:55.222
responsible for
her disappearance

10:55.255 --> 10:56.857
will be brought to justice.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.491
TOMAS: The Rance family
has asked me to let you know

10:58.525 --> 11:01.128
how grateful they are
for your prayers tonight.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.563
We need more than that.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.699
We need your help.

11:05.733 --> 11:09.536
The Parish of St. Anthony's
is offering a $100,000 reward

11:09.569 --> 11:12.239
for information leading
to Casey's recovery.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.575
So if you see or hear anything
that might help us,

11:15.608 --> 11:17.244
please call us.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.847
(reporters clamoring)
Mrs. Rance!

11:19.880 --> 11:22.082
If you could say one
thing to Casey right now...

11:22.115 --> 11:23.917
For God's sake, leave her alone.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.887
Have some decency.
Ms. MacNeil,

11:26.920 --> 11:28.088
can you tell us
what your involvement

11:28.121 --> 11:29.823
in this matter is?

11:29.857 --> 11:32.359
Casey is my granddaughter.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.595
I'm here with our family.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.030
REPORTER:
Wasn't her daughter
possessed or something?

11:37.064 --> 11:38.265
WOMAN: What about
the nine people

11:38.298 --> 11:40.633
who got murdered
half a mile from here?!

11:42.069 --> 11:43.871
Poor people of color.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.272
Guess that don't rate

11:45.305 --> 11:48.075
with your department,
Superintendent.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.843
I guess because we don't have
any movie stars

11:49.877 --> 11:52.880
backing us, none of y'all
with the cameras give a...

11:52.913 --> 11:54.882
Don't put...
Officer, stand down.

11:54.915 --> 11:58.518
Point your damn cameras
in this direction.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.088
Get your lights
on these faces.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.927
We don't have any reward money,

12:06.960 --> 12:09.429
but they're people, too.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.067
They're Chicago, too.

12:16.503 --> 12:21.241
Andre Christopher Williams!

12:21.274 --> 12:24.577
Lydia Denise Williams!

12:24.611 --> 12:27.214
Randall James McAlister!

12:27.247 --> 12:30.150
Rhonda Foley McAlister!

12:32.252 --> 12:36.423
Danielle McAlister Simpson!

12:36.456 --> 12:41.128
Hakim Mohammed Abouzaid!

12:41.161 --> 12:43.563
James

12:43.596 --> 12:46.233
Anthony Simpson!

12:46.266 --> 12:49.136
Patricia Walls!

12:49.169 --> 12:52.806
Etta Mae Walls!

13:00.680 --> 13:02.149
Forgive me for asking questions
you've already answered,

13:02.182 --> 13:04.251
Mr. Rance.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.353
On the night that Casey
was put in the ambulance,

13:06.386 --> 13:09.489
a man was taken
into custody, a priest.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.991
That's right.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.360
It's my understanding
that he performed a...

13:13.393 --> 13:15.095
an exorcism here?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.197
Yes, with our permission.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.032
JAFFEY: Uh, but not
the permission of the Church.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.700
Which we've managed to
keep out of the papers,

13:20.733 --> 13:23.036
as a favor to our
friends in the diocese.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.872
I'm a Catholic myself.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.639
Thank you.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.876
Just the one priest, yes?

13:28.909 --> 13:29.977
Yes.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.714
We'd like to speak
with this Marcus Keane again.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.317
How is that supposed to
help you find my daughter?

13:37.350 --> 13:40.320
Is he okay there?

13:40.353 --> 13:43.223
Yes.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.859
He's fine. He's recovering
from a brain injury.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.295
We're doing everything
in our power

13:48.328 --> 13:50.197
to find your girl,
Mrs. Rance.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.531
And that's easier
when we present

13:51.564 --> 13:53.333
a unified front
to the media.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.336
Rumors about possession tend
to confuse the issue.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.837
I don't know where Marcus is.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.473
Maybe you can shed a little
light on something else.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.809
We've been investigating
this case as a kidnapping.

14:02.842 --> 14:07.580
But... I understand that
your daughter broke a man's jaw

14:07.614 --> 14:09.983
on the L and then was held
in the psych ward

14:10.017 --> 14:11.751
at Adams Memorial.

14:11.784 --> 14:15.989
It's not possible that...
she could have done this, is it?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.690
JAFFEY: I mean, I hardly
think that's possible.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.026
Mrs. Rance,
please, we're not trying

14:19.059 --> 14:21.194
to upset you here.
I-I apologize.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.769
Did they have families?

14:29.802 --> 14:32.272
Mr. Harris did.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.707
A wife and a kid.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.776
Another one on the way.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.878
TALK SHOW HOST: Regan, do you
think you'll ever be capable

14:38.912 --> 14:40.413
of having a normal life?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.215
What do you mean?
Well, let's say

14:42.249 --> 14:44.117
you go to college
in a few years, you get there,

14:44.151 --> 14:46.353
you tell everyone,
"I'm Regan MacNeil."

14:46.386 --> 14:49.089
Are you worried they'll all say,
"My God, it's the demon girl"?

14:49.122 --> 14:51.658
CHRIS: I see you know
about the book.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.396
Not my finest hour.

15:00.934 --> 15:04.871
I think you need to know
what was going on back then.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.474
The scandal of it all.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.909
Protestors showing up
at the theater.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.811
My first movie back.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.081
"Devil worshiper!

15:14.114 --> 15:16.083
Satan's whore!"

15:16.116 --> 15:18.818
And that was mild.

15:18.851 --> 15:23.056
You know the expression, there's
no such thing as bad publicity?

15:23.090 --> 15:25.792
Well, the studio
didn't agree with that,

15:25.825 --> 15:27.794
and they dropped me.

15:27.827 --> 15:31.564
So, sometimes
you just have to do

15:31.598 --> 15:33.900
what you do to survive.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.336
Why do you think it happened?

15:36.369 --> 15:38.538
Why did it choose her?

15:40.340 --> 15:43.143
We were staying in this house,

15:43.176 --> 15:45.145
and, um...

15:45.178 --> 15:49.082
there was an old Ouija board
down in the basement.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.917
She loved it.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.020
It was so cute to watch.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.821
Rags just
sitting there,

15:54.854 --> 15:57.157
talking to her
imaginary friend.

15:57.190 --> 16:00.927
Someone...

16:00.960 --> 16:03.430
something...

16:03.463 --> 16:06.066
called Captain Howdy.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.073
Damn game.

16:15.742 --> 16:19.146
Dealing with those kinds
of forces...

16:19.179 --> 16:22.382
Anyway, she loved it.
She kept playing with it,

16:22.415 --> 16:25.818
and I told her she really should
stop, but, you know, I-I was...

16:25.852 --> 16:27.554
I was the lead in the film

16:27.587 --> 16:30.190
and we-we were doing
five scenes a day

16:30.223 --> 16:32.292
and I just couldn't be
there every hour, so...

16:32.325 --> 16:35.295
And she... she didn't listen.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.896
I don't know.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.965
It kind of sounds
like you're blaming the victim.

16:38.998 --> 16:43.170
I mean, she was just a kid.
She didn't do anything wrong.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.671
She didn't ask
for any of this.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.473
CHRIS: No, I...
Of course she didn't.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.007
It was my fault.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.677
My child needed me,
and I wasn't there.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.681
And that is something
that I will have to live with

16:54.714 --> 16:56.183
the rest of my life.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.854
(indistinct chatter)
(phones ringing)

17:06.859 --> 17:09.729
MARIA:
$100,000 reward?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.398
I'm so, so sorry.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.900
I-I probably should have told
you what I was using it for.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.702
It was a donation.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.838
It's your money. I think
it's a terrific use for it.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.442
I happen to know the girl's
mother tangentially.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.611
She's suffering a great deal.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.946
I can only imagine.

17:26.979 --> 17:30.183
Daughter possessed by a demon.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.119
The service

17:32.152 --> 17:34.954
you wanted to perform
and not tell Bishop Egan,

17:34.987 --> 17:37.090
it was exorcism,

17:37.124 --> 17:38.125
right?

17:38.158 --> 17:40.260
I really cannot talk about it.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.264
I know
it's an overwhelming time.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.599
There's an event this evening
at my house,

17:46.633 --> 17:49.035
sponsored by the Friars
of Ascension Charity

17:49.068 --> 17:51.104
and honoring
the Papal Planning Committee.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.372
Yes, yes.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.274
Uh, Bishop Egan asked me
to go there,

17:54.307 --> 17:57.610
but... I really need to be here.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.879
You'll meet a lot
of influential people, Tomas.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.614
You might make a few friends.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.616
Well, I'm not looking
for friends.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.253
I'm looking for Casey.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.555
(knocking at door)

18:08.588 --> 18:11.624
Sorry. You have a visitor.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.829
You're right, of course.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.266
Forget I mentioned it.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.735
I'm sure
you have better things to do.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.637
Thank you, Mrs. Walters.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.072
Maria.
Maria.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.640
Maria, of course.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.042
He's all yours.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.316
CHERRY:
Tattersal Landscaping.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.152
Filed for bankruptcy, 2004.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.921
Shuttered, closed,
end of story, right?

18:41.954 --> 18:44.324
I'm guessing not.
Three years ago,

18:44.357 --> 18:48.495
Tattersal's assets were acquired
by Walters Industrial Holdings,

18:48.528 --> 18:51.364
as in George and
Maria Walters.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.466
We checked
with the State board.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.302
No business license
was ever renewed.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.969
Meaning what?

18:57.003 --> 18:59.005
Meaning why are there vans
all over town

18:59.038 --> 19:00.673
for a landscaping company
that went out of business

19:00.707 --> 19:02.675
a decade ago?
You guys asked about

19:02.709 --> 19:04.377
what's weird in this town.
Tattersal

19:04.411 --> 19:07.280
is the big freaking weird.
Van drives up,

19:07.314 --> 19:08.848
van takes you away.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.683
No one ever sees
you again. Poof.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.285
And there's more.
(radio chirps)

19:12.319 --> 19:14.887
They're very active in
their charitable giving.

19:14.921 --> 19:18.525
$1.8 million to the
Friars of Ascension.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.461
The friars are sponsoring
this papal event tonight.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.895
What do you make
of all this?

19:22.929 --> 19:24.731
(indistinct radio transmission)

19:24.764 --> 19:27.166
Yo, Colin Firth.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.201
LESTER: Colin Firth? No.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.802
It's more like a
scruffy Alec Guinness.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.138
One girl, four days missing,

19:32.171 --> 19:35.408
in a city of three
million people.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.410
Finding her
may not be God's will.

19:37.444 --> 19:40.480
I don't care about God's will.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.450
(phones ringing)
(indistinct chatter)

19:45.452 --> 19:48.588
(phone rings)

19:48.621 --> 19:50.823
Casey Rance Hotline.

19:50.857 --> 19:54.193
MAN: Do you think
God is punishing you?

19:56.396 --> 19:58.197
Who is this?

19:58.231 --> 20:01.634
You were such a bad little girl,
Regan.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.104
You wanted me in you.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.173
So did
your pretty little daughter.

20:07.206 --> 20:11.944
But now I fear
the bloom is off the rose.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.281
Please,

20:14.314 --> 20:16.549
don't hurt my daughter.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.951
I could give her back to you,

20:18.985 --> 20:21.120
if you really want.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.623
Are you sure you still want her?

20:24.891 --> 20:27.360
I do.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.961
Please.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.630
All right.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.266
What if I just told you
where she is?

20:34.301 --> 20:36.303
Where is she?

20:36.336 --> 20:39.339
Right behind you.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.949
*

20:49.982 --> 20:50.883
(screams)

20:50.917 --> 20:53.252
(gasps, panting)

20:55.154 --> 20:57.757
(indistinct chatter)
(phones ringing)

21:06.499 --> 21:10.002
I'm sorry I didn't
call you back.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.439
I needed to...

21:12.472 --> 21:14.307
think about what to say.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.710
Do you feel guilty?

21:20.713 --> 21:22.915
I'm not gonna apologize
for being happy.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.352
I think...

21:25.385 --> 21:28.020
I think the world owes us
a little happiness.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.691
I have duties,

21:31.724 --> 21:33.826
uh, responsibilities
to the Church,

21:33.860 --> 21:36.028
to the... to the
Rance family...

21:36.062 --> 21:38.398
I moved out.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.802
The marriage is over.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.405
Probably has been
for a long time.

21:54.213 --> 21:57.283
I rented a tiny apartment
in Rogers Park.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.885
You can come to this room.

21:58.918 --> 22:02.288
It's a place where
there's no guilt, no shame.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.323
No furniture, either.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.893
But it's a place
where I'm not married

22:06.926 --> 22:08.361
and you're not a priest.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.162
Leave everything else outside.

22:12.599 --> 22:15.234
I'm not gonna come.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.104
That's fine, too.

22:19.572 --> 22:22.942
I'm gonna hang these up
at my work.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.683
(phone ringing)
(indistinct chatter)

22:30.717 --> 22:33.119
(sighs)

22:34.621 --> 22:36.623
(sighs)

22:39.792 --> 22:42.061
Henry.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.230
You okay?

22:44.263 --> 22:46.699
Who is that woman?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.737
The one in your photo album?

22:50.770 --> 22:52.772
The one you always said
was your mother?

22:55.442 --> 22:57.877
I found it
in a thrift store, honey.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.882
See, the thing is...

23:02.915 --> 23:06.285
there are so many gaps, but

23:06.318 --> 23:10.122
one thing
I could always hang onto...

23:10.156 --> 23:13.225
was you and the girls.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.529
And now I find out

23:16.563 --> 23:18.030
that half of what you told me...

23:18.064 --> 23:19.966
Henry.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.602
Henry, look at me.

23:22.635 --> 23:25.438
Our life, our family?

23:25.472 --> 23:27.373
It's not a lie.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.609
It's real.

23:29.642 --> 23:34.113
Every second... has been real.

23:34.146 --> 23:37.283
I never lied to you about that.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.923
But you didn't trust me enough
to tell me,

23:43.956 --> 23:47.627
even after it started
to happen to Casey.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.998
(door opens)

24:05.645 --> 24:08.715
Who printed these?

24:10.049 --> 24:12.952
This is the wrong phone number.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.921
And I told you, I told you

24:14.954 --> 24:16.523
that this one has
the wrong phone number,

24:16.556 --> 24:19.659
and someone printed
500 of them!

24:19.692 --> 24:22.862
(sighs)

24:22.895 --> 24:24.631
Please forgive me.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.833
TARA: Like, I'm sorry your
neighbor mows his lawn naked.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.968
How does that help us
find Casey Rance?

24:29.001 --> 24:30.469
Like, I'm sorry you have

24:30.503 --> 24:32.939
a pack of wild dogs going crazy
in your neighborhood.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.007
TOMAS:
Tara?

24:35.041 --> 24:37.810
Where are these dogs?

24:37.844 --> 24:40.246
(phone buzzing)

24:47.987 --> 24:50.389
(both speaking French)

24:54.426 --> 24:57.029
MARIA: Your Eminence.
And Father Bennett.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.965
So happy to have you.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.200
So glad to see you.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.670
(indistinct chatter)

25:05.772 --> 25:08.474
MAN:
There's a common,

25:08.507 --> 25:11.844
sentimental notion that
angels are all around us,

25:11.878 --> 25:14.747
solving little
domestic problems.

25:14.781 --> 25:19.018
But in the Bible,
when humans encounter an angel,

25:19.051 --> 25:21.520
they fall to their knees
in fear.

25:21.554 --> 25:25.658
These are beings
of tremendous power.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.159
Think of the first
renegade angels,

25:27.193 --> 25:30.062
in league with Lucifer.

25:30.096 --> 25:32.531
They were strong enough
to challenge God.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.002
And surely, God....

25:36.035 --> 25:39.205
Dr. John Rexroth,

25:39.238 --> 25:42.208
one the professors at
U of C's Divinity School.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.276
An incredible man.
REXROTH:
God actually created these

25:44.310 --> 25:47.013
rogue angels, knowing
that they would defy Him,

25:47.046 --> 25:49.415
because what was the end
result of this defiance?

25:49.448 --> 25:53.085
Lucifer came to Earth
in the guise of a serpent.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.421
REXROTH: Very good...
I've seen that man before.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.590
It's the police
superintendent.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.461
A lot of influential
people support the Friars.

26:02.494 --> 26:03.796
It's the head of
the Teamsters,

26:03.830 --> 26:05.297
and the head of
our stock exchange.

26:05.331 --> 26:08.367
And what did we gain
from that famous snake?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.903
Knowledge, free will,

26:10.937 --> 26:12.739
the ability
to think for ourselves,

26:12.772 --> 26:15.141
which led to everything
you see now in this room--

26:15.174 --> 26:18.544
civilization, art,
culture, music,

26:18.577 --> 26:21.080
life.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.783
In some strange way,

26:23.816 --> 26:26.452
these rogue angels
were the architects

26:26.485 --> 26:28.120
of all that we hold dear.

26:28.154 --> 26:29.689
(chuckles)

26:40.366 --> 26:43.736
CHRIS: Sure, Christmases
were hard.

26:43.770 --> 26:47.106
Her birthday was
really hard.

26:47.139 --> 26:50.743
But, um, to be honest with
you, the most painful moments

26:50.777 --> 26:54.080
of the last
40 years were...

26:54.113 --> 26:56.816
when I would think about
what our lives could've been

26:56.849 --> 26:59.686
if, you know, this
hadn't happened.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.321
MAN: And when you first
heard Casey was missing,

27:02.354 --> 27:06.826
did you see a connection
to what happened to Regan?

27:06.859 --> 27:08.494
Angela! Good, you're here.

27:08.527 --> 27:09.929
Angela, this is Tim.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.864
He's doing an article
for the Metro Section.

27:11.898 --> 27:15.101
You need to leave my house, now.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.837
Angela, don't be silly.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.605
He's gonna keep her name
out there.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.708
Ms. Rance, if I could just
have five minutes, I'll...

27:26.178 --> 27:27.413
I'm sorry.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.617
I was just trying to help.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.952
(sighs)

27:32.985 --> 27:34.854
You should go
pack up your things.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.326
If we ever hope
to see Casey's face again,

27:40.359 --> 27:42.128
we have to keep her in the news.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.963
My daughter is missing!

27:43.996 --> 27:45.732
My family is falling apart.

27:45.765 --> 27:48.567
And I refuse to allow you
to make this about you!

27:48.600 --> 27:51.370
God, this is exactly
what you did to me before!

27:51.403 --> 27:53.672
What have I ever
done but love you?

27:53.706 --> 27:55.141
You used me!

27:55.174 --> 27:56.675
How could you?

27:56.709 --> 27:58.344
How could you exploit

27:58.377 --> 28:00.713
what happened to me, to my body?

28:00.747 --> 28:05.417
And for what? To-to save
your precious acting career?

28:08.587 --> 28:10.757
We had no money, Regan.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.892
I did the best I could.

28:12.925 --> 28:15.361
And for what?

28:17.196 --> 28:19.265
You were my whole world.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.100
And you left me.

28:21.133 --> 28:24.603
And I had to live knowing
that I had driven you away.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.908
God.

28:28.941 --> 28:32.711
I spent the next 12 years
sipping peach schnapps

28:32.745 --> 28:34.413
and downing Xanax.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.050
In Sedona.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.356
You knew where I was?

28:44.390 --> 28:46.759
Sedona,

28:46.793 --> 28:49.195
Palmdale,

28:49.228 --> 28:51.197
Temecula.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.332
Yeah, I always knew.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.636
(phone buzzing)

28:57.669 --> 29:00.106
(sighs)

29:01.273 --> 29:03.642
This is Angela Rance.

29:03.675 --> 29:06.112
Who is it?

29:07.246 --> 29:09.782
All right.

29:09.816 --> 29:12.251
Yes, I know where that is.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.923
Good-bye.

29:20.159 --> 29:23.595
It was, uh,
the coroner's office.

29:23.629 --> 29:26.465
They think
they might have found Casey.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.174
Maria. My Cherie.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.278
You work so hard for us.

29:39.311 --> 29:44.350
I hope you will
be rewarded.

29:44.383 --> 29:47.153
Professor, forgive me.

29:47.186 --> 29:51.690
These angels you brought
up in your lecture--

29:51.723 --> 29:55.194
there's another word to
describe them-- demons.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.996
Call them that if you like.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.131
If you recall from seminary,
that term derives

29:59.165 --> 30:01.033
from the Greek word
for a nature spirit.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.535
Have you ever seen
a demon before?

30:03.569 --> 30:05.304
I have.

30:05.337 --> 30:09.008
Oh, aren't you full
of surprises?

30:22.821 --> 30:25.191
(indistinct chatter)

30:26.993 --> 30:29.528
(reporters clamoring)

30:34.333 --> 30:36.268
*

31:02.929 --> 31:05.531
I never got a chance
to know Casey.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.403
We don't know
if this is Casey.

31:17.543 --> 31:22.114
I could have fought a lot harder
to stay in Regan's life, Father.

31:25.151 --> 31:27.753
Don't you do what I did.

31:27.786 --> 31:30.122
You hold on to the
people you love.

31:30.156 --> 31:31.757
You hold them close.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.352
*

32:13.499 --> 32:15.934
(door opens)

32:20.339 --> 32:21.940
It's not her.

32:23.175 --> 32:24.410
It's not her.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.944
(sighs)

32:38.957 --> 32:42.661
She's still alive.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.730
(crying)

32:46.832 --> 32:48.867
(dogs barking in distance)

32:56.042 --> 32:58.077
(rats squealing)

33:16.528 --> 33:18.930
(people grunting)
(empty bottle rattles)

33:34.913 --> 33:36.582
Casey?

33:40.186 --> 33:42.888
(man gasping)

33:46.058 --> 33:49.995
(nearby retching)

33:50.028 --> 33:52.431
Casey.

33:53.899 --> 33:57.336
(indistinct shouting)

33:57.369 --> 34:00.939
Stop him, stop him, stop him.

34:00.972 --> 34:03.008
I can't help you.
Stop him, stop him.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.245
I'm sorry.
Stop him, stop him,
stop him, stop him...

34:06.278 --> 34:08.980
(man continues whispering
"stop him")

34:10.249 --> 34:12.384
(coughing)

34:13.585 --> 34:17.256
(indistinct shouting)

34:17.289 --> 34:19.191
MAN:
Stop him, stop him, stop him,

34:19.225 --> 34:21.627
(continues repeating "stop him")

34:23.129 --> 34:24.796
Casey.

34:24.830 --> 34:28.334
(man continues repeating
"stop him")

34:41.913 --> 34:43.449
Stop him! Stop him!

34:43.482 --> 34:45.251
Stop him!
Stop him!

34:45.284 --> 34:46.918
Stop him! Stop him...

34:46.952 --> 34:48.487
Look, I'm don't want
to hurt you.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.055
(shushing)
No!

34:50.088 --> 34:52.791
(all clamoring)

34:54.493 --> 34:56.061
Stop him!
Stop him!

34:56.094 --> 34:57.663
(grunting)

34:59.198 --> 35:00.766
In the name of Christ,

35:00.799 --> 35:03.135
get back!

35:03.169 --> 35:04.536
(all moaning)

35:13.879 --> 35:15.181
(clattering on concrete)

35:17.883 --> 35:19.151
Casey!

35:21.019 --> 35:22.288
(roars)

35:24.323 --> 35:26.392
Okay, keep me posted.

35:28.059 --> 35:29.861
The girl in the morgue,
it's not her.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.264
Your people need to find her

35:32.298 --> 35:33.965
before anyone else does.

35:33.999 --> 35:36.335
Hello, hello!

35:36.368 --> 35:39.037
Oh, what have I missed?

35:39.070 --> 35:40.306
He's here.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.340
BROTHER SIMON:
And you're here, too.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.674
The Friars of Ascension.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.376
What a day it's been.

35:44.410 --> 35:45.844
This afternoon,

35:45.877 --> 35:47.346
at the farmer's market,

35:47.379 --> 35:49.481
there was a pyramid

35:49.515 --> 35:53.118
of Granny Smiths
in all their green pride.

35:53.151 --> 35:57.223
And I looked into the eyes of
the man who owned these apples,

35:57.256 --> 35:58.990
and he saw my collar
and he said,

35:59.024 --> 36:01.393
"Take any one you want, Father."

36:01.427 --> 36:05.797
So I plunged my hand
into the center of that pile,

36:05.831 --> 36:07.333
and took the best,

36:07.366 --> 36:10.068
knocking dozens of the rest
to the ground.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.803
He said,

36:11.837 --> 36:16.408
"That's okay, Father."

36:16.442 --> 36:17.709
(laughing)

36:21.213 --> 36:23.849
I don't see Father Tomas here.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.317
He'll be a tough nut

36:25.351 --> 36:27.553
to crack, Your Eminence.
Yeah.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.455
We have our ways.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.191
(footsteps)

36:37.729 --> 36:39.431
You came.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.132
(sighs)
Yes.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.569
Come with me.

36:43.602 --> 36:47.473
Keys in the bowl,
cell phone, your watch.

36:51.643 --> 36:53.679
No time here.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.582
I-I cannot sleep with you.

36:56.615 --> 36:57.849
I can't.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.217
It's fine.

36:59.251 --> 37:00.886
Sit.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.888
I just made dinner.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.593
It's, uh,
butternut squash.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.550
(Komita's "Chinar Es" plays)

37:31.583 --> 37:33.151
*

37:44.930 --> 37:49.134
Have you all come to me
of your own free will?

37:49.167 --> 37:51.236
ALL:
We have.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.406
Using the birthright
of self-will

37:54.440 --> 37:57.643
handed down to you
by your true Father?

37:57.676 --> 38:01.313
ALL:
Body and soul are His to enjoy.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.349
*

38:04.350 --> 38:07.085
Vocare...

38:07.118 --> 38:08.820
Pulvere.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.198
Star of the Morning,

38:20.231 --> 38:22.801
Son of Dawn,

38:22.834 --> 38:26.037
we beseech you
and your legion

38:26.071 --> 38:27.873
