WEBVTT

00:00.497 --> 00:03.906
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

00:04.508 --> 00:07.090
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.158 --> 00:09.558
When you're burned,
you've got nothing -

00:09.626 --> 00:12.229
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.296 --> 00:14.590
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.658 --> 00:16.617
Where am I?
Miami.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.876
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.944 --> 00:22.469
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

00:22.537 --> 00:24.134
A trigger-happy
ex-girlfriend...

00:24.135 --> 00:25.797
Should we shoot them?

00:25.798 --> 00:28.257
...An old friend who used
to inform on you to the fbi...

00:28.324 --> 00:30.656
You know spies -
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.724 --> 00:33.188
...Family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:33.254 --> 00:35.351
...If you're desperate. Someone
needs your help, michael.

00:35.419 --> 00:37.885
Bottom line -
as long as you're burned,

00:37.952 --> 00:39.852
You're not going anywhere.

00:42.852 --> 00:44.316
Ev
io usprly on "burn notice"...

00:44.317 --> 00:46.217
I don't know why you're willing
to meet this gilroy.

00:46.249 --> 00:47.882
He sounds as bad
as the people who burned you.

00:47.883 --> 00:49.315
He's worse.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.317
This man is
a freelance psychopath.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.316
Westen.

00:53.383 --> 00:56.346
I have to say,
I find you quite fascinating.

00:56.414 --> 00:58.080
You and I have
a lot in common.

00:58.081 --> 01:00.147
What do you say we
work together? Tempting.

01:00.214 --> 01:01.546
The gist is this -

01:01.547 --> 01:03.746
You're to steal flight data
for every private plane

01:03.814 --> 01:05.646
Flying in and out of miami
for the next six weeks.

01:05.647 --> 01:07.047
What are you doing?

01:07.048 --> 01:08.380
I'm offering you a job.

01:08.381 --> 01:09.580
You do it,
you get paid money.

01:09.581 --> 01:11.347
That's all you need to know.

01:11.348 --> 01:13.881
This is another moment
of truth, michael.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.148
Do we have a future together
or not?

01:16.215 --> 01:17.281
Double my fee.

01:17.282 --> 01:18.615
Fair enough.

01:18.616 --> 01:20.315
I may lose my seat
at the table

01:20.316 --> 01:22.816
If I don't come up with six weeks'
worth of private flight records.

01:22.884 --> 01:24.249
I was thinking
the coast guard.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.416
That's a good choice.

01:25.417 --> 01:28.017
This is
every flight today.

01:28.084 --> 01:31.584
Every day is exactly
like that except one day.

01:31.652 --> 01:32.818
The 22nd.

01:32.819 --> 01:34.818
Somebody
needs a wide berth.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.518
This is some kind of
serious black flight, mike.

01:36.519 --> 01:38.053
Originating in chile,

01:38.054 --> 01:41.420
Fuel stop in miami,
destination - poland.

01:41.488 --> 01:43.254
This is what gilroy
is interested in.

01:43.255 --> 01:45.688
You're a tad overdressed for
the jacuzzi, don't you think?

01:45.756 --> 01:47.689
Is this your card?

01:47.756 --> 01:50.489
It's blatantly not
six weeks of flight plans.

01:50.557 --> 01:52.457
Just the one that you want. I need
to know what's going to poland.

01:52.491 --> 01:55.224
Well, I suppose
it's only natural to be curious.

01:55.292 --> 01:58.192
It's a weaponized plague
and a vaccine to match.

01:58.259 --> 02:00.426
And they're worth
a bloody lot of money.

02:00.494 --> 02:01.727
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

02:01.728 --> 02:03.128
You're in, then?

02:03.129 --> 02:06.595
Gilroy, I think you and I have
a bright future together.

02:06.663 --> 02:08.562
So, learn anything?

02:08.631 --> 02:10.797
Only that
he's a damn good liar.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.669
When you need to locate
a foreign spy office,

02:17.737 --> 02:19.571
It's all about the food.

02:19.572 --> 02:21.340
Spies like home cooking
just like everyone else.

02:21.341 --> 02:21.540
Find out who serves
their elgialies,

02:21.541 --> 02:24.576
Spies like home cooking
just like everyone else.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.411
Tip the bartenders
and delivery boys well,

02:26.412 --> 02:28.077
And they'll usually tell you

02:28.078 --> 02:30.544
Who placed the big orders
on the last national holiday.

02:30.611 --> 02:33.213
If some of these orders head to
an office with tight security

02:33.281 --> 02:35.115
And scowling workers
with short haircuts,

02:35.116 --> 02:36.515
You're in business.

02:36.516 --> 02:38.950
You know, some guys take girls

02:39.018 --> 02:43.252
To the beach, concerts,
farmers' markets -

02:43.320 --> 02:48.450
Ugly polish
military-intelligence offices...

02:48.518 --> 02:50.184
Not so much.

02:50.185 --> 02:52.218
Believe me, I'd rather be
at a farmers' market

02:52.286 --> 02:54.753
Than bribing a bureaucrat to
tell me what's on a spy plane.

02:54.821 --> 02:56.721
I have an idea.

02:56.755 --> 02:58.589
Instead of working
with gilroy the psychopath,

02:58.590 --> 03:00.490
Instead of sneaking around
trying to figure out

03:00.491 --> 03:02.091
What he wants to steal
from this plane,

03:02.092 --> 03:03.324
Shoot him
and be done with him.

03:03.325 --> 03:04.926
I've considered it.

03:04.927 --> 03:07.093
But somebody hired gilroy.

03:07.161 --> 03:09.394
If I want to find out
what's going on and stop it,

03:09.462 --> 03:12.030
I need him breathing, and you
know that as well as I do.

03:12.097 --> 03:15.898
Oh, there he is,
right on time.

03:15.966 --> 03:17.833
You sure this guy konrad
is the one to go after?

03:17.834 --> 03:21.335
Low on the totem pole at work,
short on cash, bad divorce -

03:21.402 --> 03:22.469
He's perfect.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.370
We're meeting
later today.

03:26.806 --> 03:28.906
How's your polish?

03:28.974 --> 03:30.874
Rusty, but his mom's
from moscow.

03:30.942 --> 03:33.009
I approach him
as a russian businessman,

03:33.077 --> 03:34.443
Buy him a few dinners,

03:34.444 --> 03:36.344
And hopefully
we end this quick.

03:43.984 --> 03:46.218
Playing on people's loyalties
is an art,

03:46.286 --> 03:49.487
Especially when those loyalties
can be murky and malleable.

03:49.555 --> 03:51.756
Poke around too much
and you'll look suspicious.

03:51.824 --> 03:54.355
Sometimes your best move
is just to commit.

03:54.423 --> 03:56.288
thank you
so much for meeting me.

03:56.289 --> 03:59.557
It's, uh, better to do business
eye-to-eye.

03:59.625 --> 04:01.391
So, what is it you could not
discuss on e-mail?

04:01.392 --> 04:05.193
Your office has information
on covert flights

04:05.261 --> 04:07.261
Passing through miami
to poland.

04:07.328 --> 04:09.062
I need information
on a flight.

04:09.063 --> 04:11.030
Why?
I own planes.

04:11.098 --> 04:13.131
I'm trying to get contract
on this flight.

04:13.199 --> 04:16.801
It would be easier if I knew
what was on the plane.

04:16.868 --> 04:18.767
It's a little thing but worth
a lot of money to me.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:27.578 --> 04:29.645
Russians.

04:29.713 --> 04:32.314
Yeah, please, yeah,
let me get briefcase.

04:35.751 --> 04:38.185
Of course, commit too hard
to the wrong side,

04:38.253 --> 04:39.720
And there's
not much wiggle room.

04:39.721 --> 04:42.088
Instead of
an instant ally...

04:42.156 --> 04:44.223
You've just made
an instant enemy.

04:44.291 --> 04:46.292
Did you really think
you could buy me,

04:46.359 --> 04:48.227
That I would betray
my country to you?

04:48.228 --> 04:49.961
You know, I was wondering

04:49.962 --> 04:52.430
Why there is extra security
at office this week.

04:52.498 --> 04:54.132
Easy, konrad. Relax.

04:54.133 --> 04:57.468
Oh, you sons of bitches
cost me everything -

04:57.536 --> 05:00.203
My job in poland,
my wife, my family.

05:00.271 --> 05:02.171
Over there now.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.977
You're going to tell me
everything.

05:08.044 --> 05:13.815
And then I'm going to cut out
your lying fsb tongue!

05:19.686 --> 05:21.586
So much
for an easy target.

05:24.604 --> 05:29.491
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

05:37.612 --> 05:40.513
You're seriously going to try
To break into konrad's office?

05:40.514 --> 05:41.881
Fi, what else can I do?

05:41.882 --> 05:43.916
I can't approach
konrad's co-workers.

05:43.984 --> 05:47.487
Well, what about
a better angle on konrad?

05:47.555 --> 05:51.323
Konrad? The guy who wanted
to interrogate me at gunpoint?

05:51.391 --> 05:53.992
But we do know that
he can't stand the russians.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.727
That's our in.

05:55.728 --> 05:57.462
Our in?

05:57.463 --> 05:59.797
Are you volunteering?

05:59.864 --> 06:01.764
I confess I am
a little curious

06:01.799 --> 06:05.134
About what a psycho like gilroy
is so interested in stealing.

06:05.201 --> 06:07.669
Probably best to approach
as american intelligence.

06:07.737 --> 06:09.637
I'll need cash for this.

06:09.639 --> 06:10.906
Deal.

06:10.907 --> 06:12.908
Sam's has a job he's been
bugging me to take -

06:12.975 --> 06:14.443
Fashion house
that got robbed.

06:14.444 --> 06:15.978
The lady who runs it
needs some help.

06:15.979 --> 06:17.446
The pay is pretty good,
apparently.

06:17.447 --> 06:18.948
Yeah, he talked to me
about it, too,

06:18.949 --> 06:20.583
But he sounded more interested
in the models than the gig.

06:20.584 --> 06:22.685
Sam, you know that job,
the fashion gig?

06:22.753 --> 06:25.287
So you're in.
Tell me that you're in.

06:25.355 --> 06:26.789
Is the money there?

06:26.790 --> 06:28.190
Oh, the money's there, mikey.
This lady is loaded.

06:28.191 --> 06:29.859
I mean, you should see
her fashion house.

06:29.860 --> 06:32.361
It's in the viceroy hotel,
and she is willing to pay.

06:33.563 --> 06:36.264
All right, sam,
I'm in.

06:36.331 --> 06:38.833
Oh, ho, ho!
Thank you, mike.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.567
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.202
This covers christmas,
my birthday present.

06:42.203 --> 06:44.103
I'll swing by
and pick you up.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.507
When you're
conducting surveillance

06:48.508 --> 06:50.042
From a dusty cave
in afghanistan,

06:50.043 --> 06:51.544
You daydream
about air-conditioning,

06:51.545 --> 06:52.945
Swimming pools, and iced tea.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.648
But spend a little time
waiting for a socialite

06:55.715 --> 06:58.984
To hand off her tiny dog
to a canine beautician,

06:59.052 --> 07:00.952
And that afghan cave
looks a little better.

07:00.986 --> 07:03.619
His usual pedicure,
of course the oatmeal shampoo,

07:03.687 --> 07:06.088
And don't forget
to rub his belly.

07:06.156 --> 07:08.924
Colonel peabody
just loves when you do that.

07:08.991 --> 07:13.461
Who doesn't? You're
funny... And cute.

07:13.528 --> 07:15.963
My girlfriend said you were
a man of many talents.

07:16.030 --> 07:18.031
You're gonna trust her?
You should do your own research.

07:19.767 --> 07:21.867
Sam said something
about a job -

07:21.935 --> 07:23.402
One of your employees
is stealing?

07:23.403 --> 07:25.670
His name is tim hastings,

07:25.738 --> 07:27.839
And we've been fighting
a lot lately.

07:27.907 --> 07:31.475
Now the numbers don't add up, which
means that money's disappearing.

07:31.542 --> 07:33.276
And you would like us
to find the money.

07:33.277 --> 07:34.744
I need you to be discreet.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.645
We'll keep it quiet.

07:36.647 --> 07:39.515
How much do you charge?
Is $30,000 enough?

07:41.417 --> 07:43.485
That's too much.
Please.

07:43.552 --> 07:46.387
This might take
a couple of days.

07:46.455 --> 07:49.790
Huh. Well...

07:49.858 --> 07:51.758
You won't be
disappointed.

07:55.996 --> 07:57.864
Recruiting an asset

07:57.865 --> 07:59.999
Is about making your target
feel important.

08:00.067 --> 08:01.834
Everything
from the clothes you wear

08:01.835 --> 08:03.436
To the location of the meeting

08:03.437 --> 08:05.004
Should communicate
how vital the mission is.

08:05.005 --> 08:07.905
Wear the right outfit,
pick the right deserted bar,

08:07.973 --> 08:10.241
And your target
will be ready to engage

08:10.308 --> 08:12.208
In some good,
old-fashioned espionage.

08:12.944 --> 08:15.846
We understand you were
approached by the russians.

08:19.150 --> 08:21.117
Are you from the agency?

08:21.185 --> 08:22.518
We have reason to believe

08:22.519 --> 08:24.486
There's a russian spy
targeting your office.

08:24.554 --> 08:26.688
Yes!

08:26.756 --> 08:28.456
He posed
as businessman.

08:28.457 --> 08:30.891
We need to figure out who this
spy is and what he's after.

08:30.959 --> 08:32.993
Of course.

08:33.061 --> 08:35.828
He asked me for information
about flight.

08:35.897 --> 08:38.364
This flight
is very important.

08:38.432 --> 08:41.200
Security at my office
has doubled.

08:41.268 --> 08:43.335
Konrad,
we need to know.

08:45.104 --> 08:46.404
I can't.

08:46.405 --> 08:50.508
It's not my job
to guard this information.

08:52.077 --> 08:54.444
It won't be easy.
You'll be taking a risk.

08:54.512 --> 08:57.747
We know how important
this is.

08:57.815 --> 09:01.116
We will cover expenses -
anything you need.

09:02.885 --> 09:05.654
Some assets work for money.
Others believe in a cause.

09:05.721 --> 09:07.756
The most effective incentive,
though,

09:07.824 --> 09:10.825
Is a combination of the two.

09:17.331 --> 09:21.367
All right. Perhaps I can find
this information.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.269
But what about this
russian cockroach?

09:23.270 --> 09:25.137
I think
we have a file on him.

09:25.138 --> 09:27.038
Good.

09:27.607 --> 09:29.975
Good news, michael.

09:30.043 --> 09:32.211
Konrad's...Enthusiastic.

09:32.278 --> 09:34.178
I think we're gonna win
the cold war.

09:34.180 --> 09:36.047
He's in?
And then some.

09:36.048 --> 09:39.417
Thing is, I promised him
the cia file

09:39.484 --> 09:42.686
On the russian spy
he almost captured.

09:42.754 --> 09:44.754
I think
I'm gonna call your mom,

09:44.822 --> 09:47.256
Ask her for some pictures
of you in your military days.

09:47.324 --> 09:49.992
Not my mom - I don't want her
involved in this, fi.

09:50.060 --> 09:52.194
Oh, don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

09:54.363 --> 09:55.697
You okay there, mikey?

09:55.698 --> 09:57.064
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:57.065 --> 09:59.333
What's up with this
easy-money job of yours?

09:59.401 --> 10:01.101
Well, bad news.

10:01.102 --> 10:02.636
I had my fingers crossed

10:02.637 --> 10:04.671
That tim, the thieving
vice president,

10:04.738 --> 10:06.072
Had a police record,

10:06.073 --> 10:08.274
But he's either clean
or careful.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.943
Owns a gun,
but it's registered.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.012
No parking tickets, even.
And yet you're smiling.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.347
Well, the fashion house
is having a big party later,

10:16.415 --> 10:18.048
And everyone's gonna be
in the atrium.

10:18.049 --> 10:20.384
That means one of us
can sneak into tim's office

10:20.451 --> 10:23.820
While the other one keeps
an eye on him...At the party.

10:23.888 --> 10:25.522
Let me guess
which job you'd like.

10:25.523 --> 10:28.057
Well, hey, I'm partial to
isabella, models, and mojitos,

10:28.125 --> 10:29.392
But I play fair.

10:29.393 --> 10:33.163
I figured we'd flip a coin.
Call it.

10:33.231 --> 10:35.131
Heads.
Cheater.

10:55.484 --> 10:57.985
quite a party.

10:58.053 --> 11:00.622
Sam didn't feel like coming?

11:00.690 --> 11:04.526
He's using your access codes
to go through tim's office.

11:04.594 --> 11:06.294
If you're dealing
with a trained operative,

11:06.295 --> 11:09.029
There are hundreds of places
to hunt for documents.

11:09.097 --> 11:11.130
If you're searching
a desk jockey's office,

11:11.197 --> 11:12.597
It's a far shorter list.

11:12.598 --> 11:14.299
Before you can say
"in the cabinet,"

11:14.300 --> 11:16.067
"behind the bookshelf,"
or "under the desk,"

11:16.068 --> 11:17.869
You've usually found
what you're looking for.

11:17.870 --> 11:20.104
Aha!

11:23.809 --> 11:25.910
So, which one's tim?
I want to keep an eye on him.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.111
He's standing
right over there.

11:27.112 --> 11:29.012
Now! Go!

11:33.051 --> 11:34.417
Act casual.

11:34.418 --> 11:37.353
of course.

11:37.421 --> 11:39.321
Let me have
a word with you.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.723
Who is he talking to now?

11:40.724 --> 11:43.025
That's my business partner,
damon.

11:43.093 --> 11:45.694
He started out designing,
and I was modeling.

11:45.761 --> 11:47.362
This company's our baby.

11:47.363 --> 11:49.397
I'm supposed to be at home
looking at his designs.

11:49.465 --> 11:50.965
Okay.

11:50.966 --> 11:52.900
I really should go.
You should go.

11:52.968 --> 11:54.168
Go home. Do some work.

11:54.169 --> 11:56.069
I'll call you later
with an update.

11:59.039 --> 12:02.040
Spies are trained to keep track
of multiple conversations

12:02.108 --> 12:03.641
At the same time.

12:03.642 --> 12:06.142
Standing alone as you eavesdrop
is too obvious.

12:06.210 --> 12:09.776
You need to engage in a cover
conversation near your target.

12:09.844 --> 12:12.243
Hi.

12:12.311 --> 12:14.812
Who are you wearing?

12:14.880 --> 12:17.548
Black suit.

12:17.616 --> 12:18.883
Love that dress.

12:18.884 --> 12:20.251
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

12:20.252 --> 12:23.254
No one has, darling.
It's an alexander deschuno.

12:23.322 --> 12:24.789
Oh.
I bought...

12:24.790 --> 12:26.591
Pure lip-reading
takes years to master.

12:26.592 --> 12:28.092
Of course.

12:28.093 --> 12:30.128
But confirming what you're
hearing by checking lips

12:30.195 --> 12:32.095
Is a much easier skill
to pick up.

12:32.097 --> 12:34.098
Don't get upset at me.
She said it.

12:34.166 --> 12:35.667
You know what?

12:35.668 --> 12:37.568
I'm gonna go talk to her right
now, 'cause this is ridiculous.

12:37.570 --> 12:39.638
Good. I think
that's a good idea.

12:39.705 --> 12:41.906
You must visit my shop
in the design district -

12:41.974 --> 12:43.572
Vintage couture.

12:43.573 --> 12:45.272
I'm talking classics.

12:45.273 --> 12:47.672
That's great.

12:47.740 --> 12:49.640
How's it going
over there?

12:49.675 --> 12:51.340
Jackpot. Found the books
in his office.

12:51.341 --> 12:52.808
Sent you a photo.
Good.

12:52.809 --> 12:54.743
Tim's heading over to talk
to isabella at her house.

12:54.810 --> 12:56.678
She'll probably want
to see that picture.

12:56.679 --> 12:58.246
Okay, good.
Head over there.

12:58.247 --> 13:00.615
I'll leave tim's office
how I found it - ugly.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.461
You were at the party.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.362
What are you doing, following
me? My name's michael.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.764
I work for isabella. I think the
three of us should have a talk.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.032
I got nothing to say
to you.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.400
Save it for inside.

13:22.401 --> 13:25.003
We found her financial records
in your office.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.038
You were in my office?

13:27.106 --> 13:30.307
That's illegal.
I should have you arrested.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.342
It doesn't take long
working in combat situations

13:32.409 --> 13:34.744
Before you start paying

13:34.812 --> 13:36.579
A lot of attention
to little things.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.181
Isabella?

13:38.182 --> 13:39.781
Things that don't feel right,
like an open gate

13:39.782 --> 13:41.816
Or a pampered dog
running around loose

13:41.884 --> 13:43.751
Often lead
to much bigger things...

13:43.752 --> 13:46.453
Oh, my god!
Isa- isabella?

13:46.521 --> 13:47.921
Jesus christ.
What the...

13:47.922 --> 13:49.989
...Like a body floating
in a swimming pool.

13:50.057 --> 13:51.357
We have to call
an ambulance...

13:51.358 --> 13:52.458
Yeah, it's too late
for that.

13:52.459 --> 13:53.959
...Or the - the police.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.261
somebody
already called them.

13:56.329 --> 13:58.864
Of course,
knowing something's wrong

13:58.932 --> 14:01.867
And being able to do something
about it are two different things.

14:01.935 --> 14:03.936
Sometimes the damage
is already done.

14:04.003 --> 14:05.437
That's my gun.

14:05.438 --> 14:07.038
What -
what the hell is happening?

14:07.039 --> 14:08.939
You've been framed.
Somebody set you up.

14:10.743 --> 14:12.711
No, no, don't.
Don't touch it.

14:14.881 --> 14:17.282
You have to believe me.
I didn't shoot her.

14:17.350 --> 14:19.751
Yeah, obviously.
We got to go out the backyard.

14:19.819 --> 14:21.886
The backyard won't work.
There's a-a wall.

14:21.954 --> 14:23.854
We'll be trapped.

14:26.891 --> 14:28.791
I vote the backyard.

14:31.028 --> 14:33.896
I told you.
We're trapped.

14:33.964 --> 14:36.364
Want to head back?
Be my guest.

14:36.432 --> 14:40.133
Otherwise,
step on my hands.

14:40.201 --> 14:41.635
We have to go around
and get my car.

14:41.636 --> 14:43.136
If they find it,
they'll know I was here.

14:43.137 --> 14:44.504
They'll think -

14:44.505 --> 14:47.206
I know you want to chat, tim,
but now is not the time.

14:50.677 --> 14:53.145
Grab this.
Wrap it around your wrist.

14:53.213 --> 14:55.747
Fall. When you do,
you'll be pulling me up. Ready?

14:55.815 --> 14:57.715
1, 2, 3.

14:59.152 --> 15:02.587
easy-money gig?

15:09.202 --> 15:12.338
Been checking the scanner
since you called.

15:12.405 --> 15:16.141
The cops are sending more units
to isabella's house.

15:16.209 --> 15:18.042
They found tim's car,
but they didn't see you.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.443
Well, whoever pulled
the trigger

15:19.444 --> 15:21.044
Must have skipped out
right before we got there.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.478
We got to call the cops.

15:22.479 --> 15:24.580
I'm gonna explain
everything right now.

15:24.648 --> 15:26.048
You know I'm innocent.

15:26.049 --> 15:28.250
So if we - if we go
to the police together,

15:28.317 --> 15:30.218
We can - we can even take
a lie-detector test.

15:30.286 --> 15:32.186
How do I know
you're innocent?

15:32.187 --> 15:33.988
Well, you said you knew
I didn't shoot her

15:33.989 --> 15:35.422
Back at isabella's place.

15:35.423 --> 15:36.589
You didn't shoot her.

15:36.590 --> 15:38.557
Doesn't mean you weren't
involved, tim.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.859
You had isabella's books.
She knew you were stealing.

15:40.927 --> 15:43.194
No, no, no, no, no.
Guys, listen to me, please.

15:43.262 --> 15:45.897
All right, damon was the one
who was stealing, all right?

15:45.964 --> 15:49.300
I was trying to convince
isabella, but he had her fooled.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.101
I- I needed to find proof.

15:51.102 --> 15:52.902
However the hell damon did it,

15:52.903 --> 15:54.903
There's no evidence
in those books.

15:54.971 --> 15:56.571
Every large money transfer

15:56.572 --> 15:58.406
Was authorized by isabella,
all right?

15:58.407 --> 15:59.742
She signed them herself.

15:59.743 --> 16:01.309
I kept telling her.
I kept telling her.

16:01.310 --> 16:04.044
She just - she believed
everything he said.

16:04.112 --> 16:05.679
You think damon
killed her?

16:05.680 --> 16:07.614
I don't know. Well, if
he's behind it, he had help.

16:07.681 --> 16:09.848
Mike, he was at the party
the whole time, wasn't he?

16:09.916 --> 16:11.250
Yeah,
he had the perfect alibi.

16:11.251 --> 16:13.318
He told me
to go to her house.

16:13.386 --> 16:16.653
He, um...Made it sound
like she was gonna fire me.

16:16.721 --> 16:18.421
I've been fighting with her.

16:18.422 --> 16:20.390
You know,
my car's outside her place.

16:20.458 --> 16:23.359
The cops are probably matching ballistics
right now, even without your gun.

16:23.426 --> 16:24.559
He's got you pretty good.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.394
Pretty good?
It's perfect!

16:26.395 --> 16:28.130
I'm dead!
It's over, man!

16:28.131 --> 16:29.765
It's not over.

16:29.766 --> 16:33.134
If it was damon, someone pulled
the trigger for him.

16:33.202 --> 16:35.636
We turn up the heat.
Maybe find some evidence.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.338
We punch holes
in their stories.

16:37.339 --> 16:38.806
You really think
we can do that?

16:38.807 --> 16:41.041
No - while I pay damon
a visit,

16:41.109 --> 16:43.110
You're going to go pay cash
for a motel room,

16:43.178 --> 16:45.312
And you're gonna sit tight
until we come get you.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.280
I'll drop you
in hialeah.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.419
We got snowed, mike.
We let isabella down.

16:52.487 --> 16:53.987
She never saw it coming.

16:53.988 --> 16:56.690
Whoever killed isabella
sure did their homework.

17:00.795 --> 17:03.030
When dealing
with a pathological liar,

17:03.097 --> 17:06.066
Don't bother looking for signs
of a guilty conscience.

17:06.134 --> 17:08.300
True deceivers enjoy the lie.

17:08.368 --> 17:10.871
They know how to look you
dead in the eye

17:10.939 --> 17:13.906
And usually shed
a few tears on demand.

17:13.974 --> 17:15.976
So if you want to know
when they're lying,

17:16.044 --> 17:17.511
Look for the little smile
that comes

17:17.512 --> 17:19.412
When deceiving
a roomful of people.

17:22.150 --> 17:24.717
That bastard is giving
quite the performance.

17:24.785 --> 17:26.585
He planned this whole thing.

17:26.586 --> 17:29.555
Let's see how he does
when we mess with his script.

17:29.622 --> 17:33.224
Thank you, officers, so much
for all the work you're doing.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.397
Damon belmont,
I'm max, isabella's max.

17:38.465 --> 17:40.432
We need to talk.
excuse me?

17:40.500 --> 17:43.235
We can talk in private...
Or in public!

17:43.303 --> 17:45.838
Okay, okay, okay,
we are on the clock.

17:45.905 --> 17:48.574
We need to reroute all Italy
shipments through paris.

17:48.641 --> 17:51.376
Ministerial commission's doing
some search and seizures.

17:51.444 --> 17:54.179
If you're planning on using
laguardia in the spring -

17:54.247 --> 17:56.815
Whoa, wait a minute, hold on.
First thing's first.

17:56.883 --> 17:58.116
Who the hell are you?

17:58.117 --> 17:59.651
She kept you in the dark.

17:59.652 --> 18:01.786
Oh, I don't even know
where to begin.

18:01.854 --> 18:03.755
Uh...This is too big
of a conversation

18:03.823 --> 18:05.123
To be having right now.

18:05.124 --> 18:06.891
Just suffice it to say
I'm max,

18:06.892 --> 18:09.627
Her other business partner...
From l.A.

18:09.695 --> 18:12.630
What the hell are you
talking about?

18:13.832 --> 18:16.633
I starch heroin
into isabella's fabrics.

18:16.701 --> 18:19.238
Production in asia,
distro through europe.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.707
We're running
about $4 million a week,

18:21.775 --> 18:24.010
So we need to improve
our communication here!

18:24.078 --> 18:25.779
When you make an approach
as a spy,

18:25.780 --> 18:27.213
You need to choose a role

18:27.214 --> 18:29.182
That puts you in the center
of the action

18:29.250 --> 18:31.885
And explains why no one's
ever hf edyou before.

18:31.953 --> 18:34.822
Claiming to be a criminal can
kill two birds with one stone.

18:34.890 --> 18:37.124
You throw around some names
and places and dates

18:37.192 --> 18:38.859
To confuse them,

18:38.860 --> 18:41.563
Show them some account books
to make it sound credible,

18:41.630 --> 18:43.865
And make the dollar figures big
enough to play to their greed.

18:43.932 --> 18:46.433
Did you say
$4 million a week?

18:46.501 --> 18:49.102
Now, about the cops
sniffing around outside -

18:49.170 --> 18:50.803
If this little murder case

18:50.804 --> 18:53.372
Leads to a federal
narcotics investigation,

18:53.440 --> 18:56.075
My new business partner
gets strangled to death

18:56.142 --> 18:57.742
With his designer tie.

18:57.743 --> 18:59.711
The police have this
under control.

18:59.778 --> 19:02.749
They already have a suspect -
one of our v.P.S.

19:02.816 --> 19:04.850
He and isabella were fighting
all the time.

19:04.918 --> 19:06.218
Did they arrest him?

19:06.219 --> 19:08.886
He's missing,
but they will find him.

19:08.954 --> 19:11.155
Oh.
they better.

19:11.223 --> 19:15.025
Or they're gonna have
another body to investigate.

19:20.965 --> 19:23.500
I shook the tree.
Let's see what falls out.

19:23.567 --> 19:27.303
All right. I'll let you know
if damon heads somewhere fun.

19:30.574 --> 19:33.876
You want to look
at old pictures of michael?

19:33.943 --> 19:35.675
Well, I realized
just the other day

19:35.676 --> 19:38.210
That I hadn't seen that many
pictures of michael's past.

19:38.278 --> 19:41.212
Isn't that wild?
It's wild.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.848
So, have you, uh,
kept any?

19:43.915 --> 19:47.284
Sure, collecting dust
in the garage.

19:47.351 --> 19:50.419
Where's michael?

19:50.487 --> 19:53.255
Uh, you know, he's -
he's helping a friend.

19:53.323 --> 19:54.856
Oh.

19:54.857 --> 19:58.293
But he was hoping that we could
borrow an album or two.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.660
So, that's all there is
to this?

19:59.661 --> 20:01.561
You and michael have
so much time on your hands

20:01.563 --> 20:03.097
That you want to just sit
and look at photos?

20:03.098 --> 20:04.398
Yeah.

20:04.399 --> 20:06.299
Every once in a while,
you got to take a break.

20:06.300 --> 20:09.536
You hang on.
I'll go get them.

20:16.009 --> 20:17.909
[ camera shuttg c

20:23.249 --> 20:25.116
They've been in the back
for a bit.

20:25.117 --> 20:27.818
Couple of photos, we get ears
in that conversation -

20:27.886 --> 20:29.753
And the cops
will have some new suspects.

20:29.754 --> 20:32.088
Cover the front.
Like a blanket.

20:37.794 --> 20:40.996
T micohockpi up
sound vibrations through walls,

20:41.063 --> 20:43.831
Allowing you to eavesdrop
on conversations.

20:47.769 --> 20:49.337
Pair one
with a wireless transmitter,

20:49.338 --> 20:51.004
And you have a bugging device

20:51.005 --> 20:53.439
That doesn't need to be in
the same room as your target.

20:53.507 --> 20:56.075
We have got
a serious problem.

20:56.143 --> 20:59.610
Damon, calm down.
What happened to your plan?

20:59.678 --> 21:01.946
We weren't supposed to see
each other for months.

21:02.013 --> 21:04.014
We weren't even supposed
to call each other.

21:04.082 --> 21:05.549
That's because
things have changed.

21:05.550 --> 21:06.883
There's this new guy.

21:06.884 --> 21:08.751
Damon, enough.
Stop freaking out.

21:08.752 --> 21:13.155
Everything's going to be fine.
I promise.

21:13.223 --> 21:16.025
No one's gonna find
anything anywhere.

21:17.927 --> 21:19.194
Christ.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.428
What was that?

21:20.429 --> 21:22.129
Interference
on the speakers.

21:22.130 --> 21:23.596
Is your phone on?

21:23.597 --> 21:25.698
No, I didn't bring my phone.
I think someone's here.

21:25.766 --> 21:28.067
Of course, bugging a room
from the outside

21:28.135 --> 21:30.502
Makes it impossible to see
potential pitfalls.

21:30.570 --> 21:32.070
Just as a cellphone reacts

21:32.071 --> 21:34.105
When it's placed too close
to your alarm clock,

21:34.173 --> 21:35.540
A roomful of speakers

21:35.541 --> 21:37.641
Can create
radio-frequency interference

21:37.709 --> 21:39.710
If you're spying on someone
with a wireless signal.

21:39.778 --> 21:41.145
You think
someone's here?

21:41.146 --> 21:42.179
Shut up!

21:42.180 --> 21:43.980
Better get
out of there, mikey.

21:43.981 --> 21:45.949
He's coming out the back.

22:10.279 --> 22:11.846
What happened
to your plan?

22:11.847 --> 22:14.081
We weren't supposed to see
each other for months.

22:14.148 --> 22:16.116
We weren't even supposed
to call each other.

22:16.184 --> 22:18.318
That's because
things have changed.

22:18.386 --> 22:19.519
How's tim?

22:19.520 --> 22:20.787
Well, he's keeping
his head down,

22:20.788 --> 22:22.522
But he's a bit of a wreck,
you know?

22:22.523 --> 22:24.190
He's a boy scout,
so he doesn't have

22:24.191 --> 22:25.825
A lot of experience
with this type of thing.

22:25.826 --> 22:27.226
We miss anything?

22:27.227 --> 22:29.561
Nothing to miss - just two guys
having an argument.

22:29.628 --> 22:32.563
Wonderful. So, checked in
with my buddy at the station.

22:32.630 --> 22:35.265
Cops are running
a full-fledged manhunt for tim.

22:35.332 --> 22:38.201
So, besides his car
at the crime scene,

22:38.268 --> 22:41.470
They just found half a box
of bullets in his garage -

22:41.537 --> 22:44.473
Predictably, perfect match for
the rounds that killed isabella.

22:44.540 --> 22:47.741
Damon and his partner
have been busy boys.

22:47.809 --> 22:51.645
Yeah, speaking of partner,
here's the guy - rick pederson.

22:51.713 --> 22:54.415
He's a club deejay.
He runs the shop during the day.

22:54.483 --> 22:57.418
Nabbed a couple of times
for dealing ecstasy,

22:57.486 --> 22:59.419
Had an assault
a while back.

22:59.487 --> 23:01.421
Let me guess -
no paper trail connecting him

23:01.488 --> 23:02.555
To damon
or the fashion house?

23:02.556 --> 23:03.790
Nothing I can find.

23:03.791 --> 23:05.926
Today was probably
the last time they meet.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.828
This is two guys
covering up a killing,

23:07.829 --> 23:10.197
So they're not exactly itching
to break the law again.

23:10.264 --> 23:14.268
Well, that is exactly
what we need them to do.

23:18.473 --> 23:21.374
Law-enforcement cover I.D.S
are tricky.

23:21.442 --> 23:24.074
Pose as a lead detective, and
you'll have unlimited access,

23:24.142 --> 23:26.743
But a single call to
the station, and you're caught.

23:26.810 --> 23:28.277
You need to think smaller.

23:28.278 --> 23:30.178
Nobody questions
the credentials

23:30.246 --> 23:32.146
Of a lowly
crime-scene investigator.

23:32.181 --> 23:33.515
Oh! Excuse me.

23:33.516 --> 23:35.117
Oh, you guys
are still here?

23:35.118 --> 23:37.286
Detective parks said
you guys were done.

23:37.354 --> 23:39.221
Yeah, we were, but, you know,
that's how it goes.

23:39.222 --> 23:40.756
You get some detective
with a new theory,

23:40.757 --> 23:42.191
And the whole department
does a 180.

23:42.192 --> 23:43.425
What are you guys
working on now?

23:43.426 --> 23:44.860
Just picking up some samples.

23:44.861 --> 23:46.461
Look, I can't really
get into it.

23:46.462 --> 23:48.296
Wait. Please.

23:48.297 --> 23:50.765
Isabella was
a dear friend of mine.

23:50.833 --> 23:53.168
Well, look, it's not
like I get the big picture.

23:53.235 --> 23:55.804
I'm just a lab tech
but sounds like they're talking

23:55.871 --> 23:57.706
About two guys
working together.

23:57.707 --> 23:59.607
What? You didn't
hear it from me.

23:59.675 --> 24:03.512
I'll probably be back tomorrow
with a whole new assignment.

24:03.579 --> 24:06.448
Looks like murder...

24:06.515 --> 24:08.415
Is in style this season.

24:09.451 --> 24:11.185
Who is this?

24:11.186 --> 24:13.087
It's your business partner -
max.

24:13.154 --> 24:15.456
You said the investigation
was almost over.

24:15.523 --> 24:17.625
You lied to me!

24:17.693 --> 24:20.762
I did not. I-it was.
It is.

24:20.829 --> 24:22.130
Then explain
why the cops

24:22.131 --> 24:23.965
Are crawling
around the fashion house.

24:23.966 --> 24:25.667
Do I have to burn
that place down?!

24:25.668 --> 24:28.703
It is not my fault that the cops
are idiots, okay?

24:28.771 --> 24:31.473
This is an easy case.
They have tim's car.

24:31.541 --> 24:33.175
Everybody here
knows he did it.

24:33.176 --> 24:35.377
Well, I might be able
to find out some more.

24:35.444 --> 24:38.746
I'm down in the parking lot.
Get out here now.

24:38.814 --> 24:40.148
Merry christmas.

24:40.149 --> 24:41.684
My god.
What are you doing?

24:41.685 --> 24:43.519
I'm being proactive.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.588
The cops questioned
tim's neighbors, too.

24:45.656 --> 24:47.657
Turns out tim has
a little girlfriend.

24:47.725 --> 24:49.292
She lives
down in homestead,

24:49.293 --> 24:52.093
And she's going to tell me
everything we need to know.

24:52.161 --> 24:53.826
Where is tim hiding?!

24:53.827 --> 24:55.361
I haven't
seen him in days.

24:55.362 --> 24:57.196
I swear.
We weren't even dating.

24:57.197 --> 24:59.197
He was just helping me
with my book.

24:59.265 --> 25:00.631
I already told all of this
to the police.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.532
Honey, I am not the police.

25:02.570 --> 25:04.870
And you sure as hell don't want
me to get upset. Where's tim?

25:04.938 --> 25:08.574
He - he made a deal
with some guy at the docks.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.375
They're gonna smuggle tim
to the bahamas.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.176
Where's the dock?

25:12.177 --> 25:16.046
On 64th street. They're leaving
at noon tomorrow.

25:16.114 --> 25:18.215
He said something
about calling the cops

25:18.282 --> 25:20.016
On some designer who tried
to kill isabella.

25:20.017 --> 25:23.318
No, no!
Don't shut me in, please! No!

25:24.821 --> 25:26.688
You killed isabella
and didn't tell me.

25:26.689 --> 25:28.824
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

25:28.892 --> 25:31.426
Listen, there is no evidence
that leads back to us.

25:31.494 --> 25:33.394
I don't care what tim says.
I used a partner.

25:33.396 --> 25:34.930
There is no connection
to me at all.

25:34.931 --> 25:36.665
It was the perfect crime.

25:36.666 --> 25:37.999
Perfect crime?
Yes.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.568
Except for one
little thing -

25:39.569 --> 25:41.736
Tim got away!

25:41.804 --> 25:43.137
Don't worry.

25:43.138 --> 25:45.106
You're gonna just black out
in about 15 seconds.

25:45.173 --> 25:47.174
wait a minute.
We can get rid of tim.

25:47.242 --> 25:48.976
We can kill him tomorrow.

25:48.977 --> 25:51.345
Now that you've found him,
we can end this.

25:53.814 --> 25:56.182
We can make it look like he got
killed trying to escape the country.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.251
The cops will close the case.
This whole thing goes away.

25:58.319 --> 26:01.554
You can pull that off?
Oh, yes.

26:01.622 --> 26:03.856
All right, listen up.
I'm heading to the everglades.

26:03.924 --> 26:05.858
I'm gonna feed the scream queen
to the gators.

26:05.926 --> 26:08.194
You and your partner are gonna
follow tim to his boat.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.496
When he's on board, you put two
in the back of his head.

26:10.564 --> 26:11.998
Okay, two in the back
of his head.

26:11.999 --> 26:14.434
You idiots will be tempted
to touch everything.

26:14.502 --> 26:17.271
Don't! Just steal
all tim's money and leave.

26:17.338 --> 26:20.408
It'll look like he met
his ride out of town,

26:20.475 --> 26:22.343
And they robbed him
and shot him. Done.

26:22.344 --> 26:24.412
You -
you do this right,

26:24.480 --> 26:26.481
And the cops
will stop investigating,

26:26.549 --> 26:31.286
And my stylish new
business partner, damon...

26:31.354 --> 26:33.154
Gets to live.

26:33.155 --> 26:35.055
You won't regret this.

26:41.031 --> 26:43.565
Oh, boy.

26:48.499 --> 26:50.099
So devious -

26:50.100 --> 26:55.004
He - he infiltrates american
defenses and then slips away.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.172
Did you track down
the flight information?

26:57.240 --> 26:58.940
Oh.

26:58.941 --> 27:01.176
Please tell cia...

27:01.243 --> 27:04.979
File is locked
in steel safe at office

27:05.047 --> 27:06.881
With guard night and day.

27:06.882 --> 27:10.784
Whatever is on this flight
is a big secret.

27:10.852 --> 27:12.819
It's very, very dangerous,

27:12.887 --> 27:14.787
So it is impossible
for russian to get.

27:17.357 --> 27:20.561
Konrad, I wasn't supposed
to tell you this.

27:20.629 --> 27:24.567
One of your co-workers
is working for the russians.

27:24.634 --> 27:27.369
There's a mole
in your office.

27:27.437 --> 27:31.173
What?
You must tell me.

27:31.241 --> 27:33.242
I will find this traitor
- no.

27:33.309 --> 27:35.010
Not yet.

27:35.011 --> 27:37.846
It'll compromise our operation,
and we're running out of time.

27:37.914 --> 27:40.649
If this mole makes his move, if
we find out what's in that safe -

27:40.717 --> 27:42.617
No, no, no,
this will not happen.

27:42.685 --> 27:45.787
I will find file
immediately.

27:45.855 --> 27:48.823
It's tough to get someone
to compromise their values

27:48.891 --> 27:50.158
In only a couple of meetings.

27:50.159 --> 27:51.659
The only way to do that

27:51.660 --> 27:53.560
Is to compromise a few values
of your own.

27:56.732 --> 27:58.566
How are you holding up?

27:58.567 --> 28:00.468
I was doing okay,

28:00.536 --> 28:03.504
Considering I've been sitting
in a motel room for three days,

28:03.572 --> 28:05.239
But let me get
this straight.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.841
We're having damon
and his partner...

28:07.909 --> 28:09.809
Try to kill me.

28:09.811 --> 28:11.278
Well, they won't
actually succeed.

28:11.279 --> 28:13.446
We just need them to get caught
by the cops looking guilty.

28:13.514 --> 28:15.048
So we rented you a boat.

28:15.049 --> 28:17.116
You walk in through
the parking lot here.

28:17.184 --> 28:19.518
Mike and I are gonna be covering
you from the roof here.

28:19.586 --> 28:21.053
When you get
to the docks, hide.

28:21.054 --> 28:23.021
The cops come in,
get damon and rick.

28:23.089 --> 28:25.224
You know, there are a lot of
things grieving co-workers do,

28:25.291 --> 28:27.492
But hunting with guns
for someone on docks,

28:27.560 --> 28:28.860
Mm, not one of them.

28:28.861 --> 28:30.595
But won't the cops
arrest me, too?

28:30.596 --> 28:33.297
Yeah, and then you'll have the
opening to tell them the truth.

28:33.365 --> 28:36.034
That plus your gun
dropped into damon's trunk

28:36.101 --> 28:38.502
Is all you need
to blow their story apart.

28:38.570 --> 28:39.670
Okay.

28:39.671 --> 28:41.672
Relax.
It's almost over.

29:00.426 --> 29:02.960
There's tim, fi.
You got him?

29:03.028 --> 29:04.928
Yep.

29:06.198 --> 29:08.098
They're our guys.

29:17.008 --> 29:19.342
Time to call the cavalry.

29:21.412 --> 29:23.713
Yes, hello, police -
I'm down on 64th,

29:23.781 --> 29:26.149
And I just saw two guys
taking guns out of their trunk.

29:26.217 --> 29:28.852
I- I think they're headed
toward the docks.

29:28.919 --> 29:31.555
Yes. Thank -
thank you very much.

29:33.991 --> 29:37.260
Uh-oh. They're not exactly
heading toward the docks.

29:37.328 --> 29:39.329
And they're
not pulling out guns.

29:39.397 --> 29:41.765
Fi, what are they
waiting for?

29:41.833 --> 29:44.001
I don't know.
Something's wrong.

29:48.073 --> 29:50.575
Mikey, that bench wasn't there
this morning.

29:50.643 --> 29:52.543
They moved a bench?

29:54.948 --> 29:57.016
Sam, we got a problem.

29:58.151 --> 30:00.619
Guys, they've got
a detonator.

30:00.687 --> 30:02.854
They're not planning
on shooting tim.

30:02.922 --> 30:04.489
Mike, if we don't
do something quick,

30:04.490 --> 30:06.058
Tim is gonna be part
of a big boom.

30:06.059 --> 30:08.227
I'd say take it out, but more
than one shot gives us away.

30:08.295 --> 30:09.495
Then I can't miss.

30:09.496 --> 30:11.396
Mikey, do it.
He's getting close.

30:24.508 --> 30:26.408
Ugh!

30:39.948 --> 30:42.216
He's still alive.

30:43.719 --> 30:45.855
Fi, pick him up.
I'm on it.

30:50.229 --> 30:52.129
Get over here!
Let's go!

30:53.865 --> 30:56.900
Tim! Tim!

30:56.968 --> 30:59.402
Fi, get out of there.
They're closing in.

31:09.712 --> 31:14.148
Freeze! Put your hands
behind your head now!

31:18.156 --> 31:19.550
I tried to grab him.

31:19.551 --> 31:21.085
I know. We saw, fi.
The guy panicked.

31:21.086 --> 31:22.454
There was nothing
you could do.

31:22.455 --> 31:24.122
Hey, so, how far are we gonna
take this?

31:24.123 --> 31:25.489
Are we busting tim
out of prison?

31:25.490 --> 31:28.026
Are we letting them get away
with killing isabella?

31:28.093 --> 31:30.728
Damon and rick just screwed up
the plan.

31:30.796 --> 31:32.730
We can use that.

31:32.798 --> 31:34.199
Mike, if that's
screwing up the plan,

31:34.200 --> 31:35.900
Then how come they got
everything they wanted?

31:35.901 --> 31:37.468
From where I'm standing,
it looks like they won.

31:37.469 --> 31:39.837
They haven't won until they know
that they've won.

31:39.905 --> 31:42.606
Fi, any chance they actually saw
tim get arrested?

31:42.674 --> 31:44.475
No, he went
around the corner.

31:44.476 --> 31:46.977
Sam, what's the time frame
on the cops announcing the bust?

31:47.045 --> 31:48.812
Well, they're taking him in now,
processing him.

31:48.813 --> 31:50.313
I don't know -
a couple hours, max.

31:50.314 --> 31:51.882
Then we have
a couple of hours.

31:51.883 --> 31:53.416
We drive damon
away from rick,

31:53.417 --> 31:54.951
Get them to turn
on each other.

31:54.952 --> 31:56.852
We give the cops
another killer.

31:58.856 --> 32:01.158
Max? No, we shouldn't
be talking.

32:01.225 --> 32:03.327
What the hell
happened down there?

32:03.394 --> 32:05.529
Everything is handled.
Don't worry.

32:05.596 --> 32:08.731
Listen, I'm gonna lay low
for a while, so don't call.

32:08.798 --> 32:10.532
Everything is handled?
Everything is not handled.

32:10.533 --> 32:12.201
What the hell was that?!
We talked -

32:12.202 --> 32:15.437
Everything's fine.
The cops showed up.

32:15.505 --> 32:17.005
There's no way he escaped.

32:17.006 --> 32:19.207
No, he did escape -
for the second time!

32:19.275 --> 32:21.275
No.
That's not possible.

32:21.343 --> 32:23.043
You know,
I'm starting to think

32:23.044 --> 32:24.845
That he is the only one
around here

32:24.846 --> 32:26.347
Who knows
what the hell he's doing!

32:26.348 --> 32:27.782
You meet me
at your office immediately,

32:27.783 --> 32:29.683
Or you're a dead man.

32:33.556 --> 32:35.456
No.

32:37.159 --> 32:39.695
Wait. What are you
still doing here?

32:39.762 --> 32:41.429
I can't talk to you -
police business.

32:41.430 --> 32:43.797
It's okay. We talked
the other day, remember?

32:43.865 --> 32:44.965
Look,
I told you, buddy,

32:44.966 --> 32:46.266
My higher-ups
never tell me much.

32:46.267 --> 32:48.167
Oh, there they are now.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.171
Yeah, this is finley.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.007
Does damon
know tim got caught?

32:55.008 --> 32:57.911
Uh, I don't think so, but I'm
following up on your leads.

32:57.979 --> 33:00.413
Looks like that tip you got
was a good one.

33:00.481 --> 33:02.182
He's listening in,
isn't he?

33:02.183 --> 33:05.085
Yes, sir.
I'll be right back down there.

33:08.489 --> 33:09.956
Were you listening
to my call?

33:09.957 --> 33:12.559
Sorry.

33:12.627 --> 33:15.263
I just really want them to find
whoever killed isabella.

33:15.331 --> 33:16.898
She was a dear friend
of mine.

33:16.899 --> 33:19.633
Shouldn't be too long
to wrap this up.

33:19.701 --> 33:23.170
It looks like
our killer's plan...

33:23.237 --> 33:25.839
Is coming apart
at the seams.

33:29.845 --> 33:31.745
No one comes in here.

33:31.746 --> 33:34.381
I said two in the back
of the head, damon.

33:34.449 --> 33:36.983
I tried to follow the plan
just like we talked about,

33:37.051 --> 33:39.018
But rick said
using a bomb was safer.

33:39.086 --> 33:41.854
You feel safe now? Tim's
probably talking to the feds!

33:41.922 --> 33:45.358
I know. I just found out
he called the cops.

33:45.426 --> 33:48.595
What's our next move?

33:48.663 --> 33:50.497
Oh, besides you
and I and rick,

33:50.498 --> 33:52.332
Who else knows
all about this?

33:52.333 --> 33:54.233
No one else -
trust me.

33:54.301 --> 33:57.136
Okay. That's good,
real good.

33:58.572 --> 34:01.507
We just have one little thing
to close the loop.

34:01.575 --> 34:03.475
No. Do not kill me!

34:03.510 --> 34:06.312
Look, I know we messed up.
That was unfortunate.

34:06.380 --> 34:08.214
I have an idea.
Of course you do.

34:08.215 --> 34:09.882
We put this on someone
else. You tried that.

34:09.884 --> 34:12.518
Another someone else -

34:12.585 --> 34:13.920
My partner, rick.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.288
He's the one who killed her,
anyway. He shot her.

34:16.356 --> 34:18.257
No, rick will talk.
He'll blame you.

34:18.324 --> 34:19.492
He'll take you
down, too.

34:19.493 --> 34:20.793
No, no,
that gets messy,

34:20.793 --> 34:22.360
And I don't want anything
getting back on me.

34:22.362 --> 34:23.695
We could kill him.

34:23.696 --> 34:25.496
No, the cops will just be
investigating his murder.

34:25.498 --> 34:27.367
We'll make it look
like he killed himself.

34:27.368 --> 34:29.402
Now, that's interesting.

34:29.469 --> 34:31.504
How would you do that?

34:31.571 --> 34:33.972
I'll write a suicide note
confessing to everything.

34:34.040 --> 34:36.042
I'll even scatter
some of isabella's files

34:36.110 --> 34:37.610
Around his office.

34:37.612 --> 34:38.879
You can shoot him.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.780
Nope.

34:40.782 --> 34:42.681
I'll get you a gun.

34:49.056 --> 34:52.025
One of the many weapons
in the spy arsenal is sabotage.

34:52.094 --> 34:54.228
Your enemy can't fight back

34:54.228 --> 34:56.630
When their vehicles won't drive
and their weapons won't fire.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.868
If you're handing
a bad guy a gun

35:00.936 --> 35:03.003
And you need it
to jam accidentally,

35:03.071 --> 35:05.706
Fatiguing the trigger assembly
to break under pressure

35:05.774 --> 35:07.674
Is probably your best move.

35:07.742 --> 35:09.375
It's undetectable,

35:09.376 --> 35:12.445
So nobody gets suspicious
and nobody gets hurt.

35:23.593 --> 35:25.493
Here you go.

35:26.562 --> 35:28.029
It was stolen.

35:28.030 --> 35:30.765
Serial number
has been filed off.

35:30.833 --> 35:32.133
Which means
it's untraceable?

35:32.134 --> 35:34.034
Completely untraceable.

35:40.042 --> 35:43.009
Keep the car running.

35:45.713 --> 35:47.614
Yeah?

35:47.681 --> 35:48.814
How we looking, sam?

35:48.815 --> 35:50.715
Cops are on their way,
mikey.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.090
What the hell
are you doing here?

36:00.091 --> 36:01.691
Do you remember
in the club

36:01.692 --> 36:04.360
When you said everything
would go perfectly?

36:04.428 --> 36:06.562
You said everything
would go perfectly.

36:06.630 --> 36:10.632
Calm down.
Everything is fine.

36:10.700 --> 36:14.069
Everything is not okay!
Tim keeps getting away.

36:14.137 --> 36:16.037
Did you want me
to get caught?

36:16.071 --> 36:18.871
What are you talking about?
Nobody is gonna get caught.

36:18.939 --> 36:20.606
I can't go down for this.

36:20.607 --> 36:22.775
There's
no other choice now.

36:22.843 --> 36:24.743
no!

36:30.148 --> 36:32.115
You son of a bitch!

36:40.123 --> 36:42.023
Oh, I hope he's okay.

36:44.460 --> 36:46.528
That's gonna bruise.

36:50.766 --> 36:52.600
Police! Stop!

36:54.102 --> 36:58.071
He shot my friend!
Arrest him! He's the killer!

37:02.543 --> 37:04.811
Well, it took a couple
of days of explaining,

37:04.878 --> 37:06.345
And my lawyer's still trying

37:06.346 --> 37:08.113
To get his head
around the details,

37:08.114 --> 37:10.182
But once damon confessed,
the truth was out.

37:10.250 --> 37:11.783
That's all you needed.

37:11.784 --> 37:14.886
We're selling the fashion house
to a label in milan.

37:14.953 --> 37:18.222
Isabella hosted benefits
for a local pet-rescue center,

37:18.290 --> 37:20.624
So we're donating
the proceeds to them.

37:20.692 --> 37:22.492
Sounds good.

37:22.493 --> 37:24.427
Take good care
of colonel peabody, will you?

37:24.495 --> 37:27.196
Yeah, I will.
Hey, thank you for your help.

37:27.264 --> 37:28.764
Yeah, fi?

37:28.765 --> 37:30.532
Hi, michael.

37:30.533 --> 37:31.900
Any progress
with konrad?

37:31.901 --> 37:33.434
I just got a message
from him.

37:33.435 --> 37:35.536
He's bringing me
the flight information today.

37:35.604 --> 37:37.037
And your mother's
been calling.

37:37.038 --> 37:38.939
I'll head over there now.

37:44.593 --> 37:46.894
Fiona returned
the albums.

37:46.962 --> 37:48.796
But some of the pictures
are missing

37:48.797 --> 37:50.597
From when you joined
the military.

37:50.598 --> 37:52.999
I think someone
must have stolen them.

37:53.067 --> 37:54.934
So mysterious.
Hmm.

37:54.935 --> 37:56.703
Oh, we'll bring them
back, mo

37:56.704 --> 37:59.906
Michael,
I thought we agreed

37:59.973 --> 38:01.807
That from now on,
you'd tell me the truth.

38:01.808 --> 38:03.175
This was a small job.

38:03.176 --> 38:06.779
Fiona had to put
together a dossier

38:06.847 --> 38:10.416
To prove that I was a -
a russian spy.

38:10.483 --> 38:12.150
Just a small job.

38:12.151 --> 38:15.387
It's kind of
a long story...

38:15.455 --> 38:17.589
Which I'll tell.

38:17.657 --> 38:20.692
it wasn't
anything dangerous.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.595
Look, the last time you and I
went through this, it was hard.

38:23.662 --> 38:25.696
I- I just don't like
seeing you get hurt.

38:25.764 --> 38:29.067
So, what, you kept me
in the dark to protect me?

38:29.134 --> 38:30.535
You know how it goes.

38:30.536 --> 38:32.436
These things
aren't so predictable.

38:34.973 --> 38:39.677
Well, she left one behind
because it was special to you.

38:42.781 --> 38:44.448
No, it's probably
'cause there's -

38:44.449 --> 38:46.017
Uh, there's writing
on the back.

38:46.018 --> 38:48.986
Oh.
It was special to me.

38:49.054 --> 38:51.388
It's one of the few times
you ever sent me anything

38:51.456 --> 38:52.856
To tell me
where you were.

38:52.857 --> 38:55.359
Well, actually, I had
already left the country.

38:55.426 --> 38:58.162
I wrote that so that you
didn't know where I was.

38:59.664 --> 39:01.564
Oh.

39:03.434 --> 39:07.004
Well, then - in the, um,
grand scheme of things,

39:07.071 --> 39:09.907
I- I suppose
we're making some progress.

39:13.712 --> 39:15.946
You
- you want some iced tea? That'd be great.

39:35.198 --> 39:38.433
This information
russian spy is after...

39:38.500 --> 39:40.734
Is much worse
than I thought.

39:40.802 --> 39:42.503
You found out what's
on that flight.

39:42.504 --> 39:43.838
Not what, it's who.

39:43.839 --> 39:46.007
Who's on the flight?

39:46.074 --> 39:50.214
There's no names, but he is
maximum-security prisoner.

39:50.282 --> 39:53.018
This document is instruction
on how to deal with him.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.587
I'd translate it
for you, but...

39:55.655 --> 39:59.458
If russian pig gets his hands
on this envelope -

39:59.526 --> 40:01.593
He'll never get it,
my friend.

40:07.566 --> 40:09.466
Thank you, konrad.

40:25.219 --> 40:29.388
We were right.
It's bad.

40:33.193 --> 40:35.894
It's a rendition
to a black site in poland.

40:35.962 --> 40:38.730
Somebody's high-risk enough
to be flown alone.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.967
"do not engage in conversation
with prisoner

40:43.035 --> 40:44.269
Under any circumstance."

40:44.270 --> 40:46.170
Sounds like a sweetheart.

40:47.573 --> 40:49.373
This kind of treatment
is reserved

40:49.374 --> 40:52.344
For world-class bad guys,
michael.

40:52.412 --> 40:56.548
I know, and somebody wants
my help to break him out.
