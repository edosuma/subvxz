GO TO THE HELIX.

00:11.167 --> 00:12.100
 I'LL CATCH UP.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.200
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.
COME ON!

00:23.334 --> 00:24.834
IT'S NO USE.

00:30.834 --> 00:33.100
WE CAN'T STOP THEM.
THEY'RE TOO POWERFUL.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.567
WE GOTTA MAKE IT
TO THE HELIX!

00:39.734 --> 00:48.434
<gunfire>

00:48.534 --> 00:49.901
COME ON.

00:53.067 --> 00:55.267
<loud explosion>

00:58.133 --> 01:00.667
 SHAL!

01:14.467 --> 01:16.100
  UH OH -
  I KNOW THAT LOOK.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.667
  WHO DIED?

01:17.767 --> 01:18.834
BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED,

01:18.934 --> 01:21.000
ADAM KANE WAS WORKING
ON SECRET RESEARCH

01:21.100 --> 01:24.234
INTO THE PROBLEM OF
MUTANT GENETIC INSTABILITY.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.701
YOUR SHORTENED LIFESPAN.

01:25.801 --> 01:27.934
  UH - YOU MEAN OUR
  DEATH SENTENCE.

01:28.033 --> 01:30.033
ACCORDING TO HIS REPORTS AT
THE TIME HE DISAPPEARED,

01:30.133 --> 01:32.467
HE STILL HADN'T
SOLVED THE PROBLEM.

01:32.567 --> 01:33.734
 OKAY...

01:33.834 --> 01:35.968
 WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO
 DO WITH ANYTHING NOW?

01:36.067 --> 01:37.267
HE LIED.

01:37.367 --> 01:38.868
NOT JUST ABOUT HIS DEATH -

01:38.968 --> 01:43.734
AND YES, WE KNOW ABOUT YOUR
RECENT CONTACT WITH ADAM...

01:43.834 --> 01:47.400
I'M SENDING YOU A DOSSIER.

01:47.501 --> 01:49.467
ADAM WAS ABLE TO ASSESS
WITH GREAT PRECISION,

01:49.567 --> 01:52.901
AN EXPIRY DATE IF YOU WILL,
FOR EACH MUTANT.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.100
A TIME WHEN THEIR UNSTABLE
GENETIC STRUCTURE

01:55.200 --> 01:57.200
WOULD CAUSE THEM
TO SELF-DESTRUCT.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.100
  WHAT DOES IT HAVE
  TO DO WITH US?

01:59.200 --> 02:03.667
JESSE KILMARTIN PASSED HIS
EXPIRY DATE TWO WEEKS AGO.

02:03.767 --> 02:05.234
 DOES THAT MEAN
 HE'S CURED?

02:05.334 --> 02:07.634
SO IT WOULD SEEM.

02:07.734 --> 02:08.800
THE DELIVERY OF KILMARTIN

02:08.901 --> 02:11.167
WILL BE YOUR FINAL ASSIGNMENT
WITH MUTANT X.

02:11.267 --> 02:12.467
 WHAT!?

02:12.567 --> 02:13.934
HUH - SO YOUR PEOPLE
CAN DISSECT HIM

02:14.033 --> 02:16.100
  LIKE SOME KIND OF
  LAB RAT? NO WAY!

02:16.200 --> 02:17.834
HIS LIFE IS A
SMALL PRICE TO PAY

02:17.934 --> 02:19.501
TO SAVE ALL OTHER MUTANTS.

02:19.601 --> 02:22.767
INCLUDING YOU AND
THE REST OF MUTANT X.

02:22.868 --> 02:25.667
 SO WHAT IF I DON'T
 LET YOU KILL HIM?

02:25.767 --> 02:28.000
YOU CAN CHOOSE, LEXA:

02:28.100 --> 02:30.067
LOSE ONE
MEMBER OF MUTANT X -

02:30.167 --> 02:32.400
OR THE WHOLE TEAM.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.901
YOU'LL DELIVER
JESSE IN ONE HOUR.

02:45.100 --> 02:49.334

04:44.133 --> 04:46.300
WHAT HAPPENED BACK
THERE AT THE CIRCUS...

04:46.400 --> 04:48.000
 HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.033
  A KISS IS JUST A KISS, RIGHT?

04:50.133 --> 04:51.601
YEAH.

04:51.701 --> 04:53.200
JUST WANTED TO HELP.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.734
WELL, GOOD.

04:54.834 --> 04:56.334
I'M GLAD WE
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

04:56.434 --> 04:58.601
  YEAH.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.400
  THIS IS NICE.

05:16.501 --> 05:19.000
  BEING HERE LIKE THIS,
  JUST US.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.267
YEAH.

05:20.367 --> 05:25.300
 I CAN ALMOST FORGET ABOUT
 GENOMEX, THE DOMINION...

05:25.400 --> 05:26.968
HMM.

05:27.067 --> 05:29.767
WELL, THIS NIGHT ISN'T
ABOUT FORGETTING.

05:29.868 --> 05:33.234
THIS NIGHT IS ABOUT
MAKING MEMORIES.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.834
 WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE WE ARE
 ALWAYS ON THE EDGE OF SOMETHING

05:35.934 --> 05:38.367
 AND NEVER QUITE THERE?

05:38.467 --> 05:40.667
UH...

05:40.767 --> 05:43.367
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE, UH...

05:43.467 --> 05:45.634
MAYBE, WE THINK
IF WE GO THERE...

05:45.734 --> 05:48.901
THERE MAY NOT BE
ANY GOING BACK.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.634
WOULD GOING THERE
BE SUCH A BAD THING?

05:51.734 --> 05:54.033
WE CAN GO
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

05:54.133 --> 05:55.434
WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO BE?

05:55.534 --> 05:57.868
<laughter>

06:01.000 --> 06:02.968
 Jesse:
  <i>BRENNAN, SHAL,

 OH...

06:04.968 --> 06:06.033
YOU GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.067
DUDE.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.834
THIS IS, LIKE, THE
WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.067
   <i>CAN'T THIS WAIT?</i>

06:11.167 --> 06:12.200
 NO. THIS IS SERIOUS.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.501
 LOOK, I NEED YOU
 BACK IN SANCTUARY.

06:13.601 --> 06:14.934
  <i>ON THE DOUBLE.</i>

06:15.033 --> 06:17.334

06:18.734 --> 06:20.968
WE'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.000
 LOOKS LIKE FATE
 SPEAKS LOUD AND CLEAR.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.634
NO, NO, NO, NO.
SCREW FATE, OKAY?

06:25.734 --> 06:28.968
THIS CONVERSATION
HAS JUST BEGUN.

06:44.033 --> 06:52.334
  <panting>

06:52.434 --> 06:53.734
IT'S DONE.

06:53.834 --> 06:56.701
WE'RE BRINGING
JESSE KILMARTIN.

06:56.801 --> 06:58.667
 ADAM ELUDED ME.

06:58.767 --> 07:01.033
 BUT THE FRUITS OF
 HIS WORK WILL NOT.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.601
THE ONLY QUESTION
IS LEXA PIERCE.

07:05.701 --> 07:08.934
WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN
WHERE HER LOYALTIES LIE.

07:09.033 --> 07:12.601
 LEXA WILL HELP US
 - WILLINGLY OR NOT.

07:12.701 --> 07:16.367
 THERE'S NO TIME FOR
 ANY OTHER OUTCOME.

07:37.868 --> 07:39.033
ALL RIGHT, JESS,
WHAT IS IT?

07:39.133 --> 07:40.567
  WHY COULDN'T YOU TELL
  US ON OUR COMLINK?

07:40.667 --> 07:41.734
I COULDN'T TRUST
THE COMMUNICATIONS.

07:41.834 --> 07:42.868
LOOK, I'VE ALREADY DONE
A SWEEP OF SANCTUARY,

07:42.968 --> 07:44.100
BUT I COULDN'T TELL
IF THE DOMINION

07:44.200 --> 07:45.567
HAD ALREADY BROKEN INTO
OUR COMLINK SYSTEM OR NOT.

07:45.667 --> 07:46.734
 WHAT IS IT?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.767
OKAY.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.434
WHEN I CAME IN EARLIER,

07:51.534 --> 07:52.968
LEXA WAS DOING SOMETHING
SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO SEE.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.701
NOW, MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE,
BUT...

07:54.801 --> 07:56.801
  I TRACKED HER ACTIVITY LOG.

07:56.901 --> 07:58.133
SO WHAT WAS SHE DOING?

07:58.234 --> 07:59.467
RAIDING YOUR MP3 COLLECTION?

07:59.567 --> 08:00.667
NO.

08:00.767 --> 08:03.334
SHE WAS ACCESSING SOME
OF ADAM'S PRIVATE FILES.

08:03.434 --> 08:04.868
FILES THAT I DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW EXISTED.

08:04.968 --> 08:06.267
 WHICH FILES?

08:06.367 --> 08:09.801
HIS RESEARCH ON THE INSTABILITY
OF OUR GENETIC STRUCTURE.

08:09.901 --> 08:11.133
 WELL, SO WHAT?

08:11.234 --> 08:12.868
 IT'S NOT LIKE HE EVER
 SOLVED THAT PROBLEM ANYWAY.

08:12.968 --> 08:14.434
WELL, THAT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE.

08:14.534 --> 08:16.801
SEE, THE DOMINION ALSO
SENT US SOME INFORMATION.

08:16.901 --> 08:18.634
IT'S ABOUT ME.

08:18.734 --> 08:20.601
I'M SUPPOSED TO
ALREADY BE DEAD.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.767
  YOU'RE LOOKING PRETTY
  GOOD FOR A DEAD GUY.

08:22.868 --> 08:23.834
LOOK, I'M SERIOUS.

08:23.934 --> 08:26.334
I... I DODGED THE BIGGEST
BULLET THERE IS.

08:26.434 --> 08:28.400
THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE WITH ADAM
HE WAS EXPERIMENTING ON US.

08:28.501 --> 08:30.767
SOMETHING HE DID WORKED,
BECAUSE I'M CURED.

08:30.868 --> 08:33.200
  WELL, THAT'S GREAT FOR YOU.
  WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US?

08:33.299 --> 08:34.100
I DON'T KNOW.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.467
IT... IT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

08:35.567 --> 08:36.567
 THAT'S COMFORTING.

08:36.667 --> 08:37.734
  WELL, THE NEXT QUESTION IS,

08:37.833 --> 08:40.267
WHAT IS LEXA DOING
ACCESSING THOSE FILES?

08:40.366 --> 08:41.933
  THINK IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
  TO DO WITH THE CREATOR,

08:42.033 --> 08:43.967
  THAT GUY SHE WARNED US ABOUT?

08:44.067 --> 08:45.267
THE LAST THING LEXA
SHOULD BE DOING

08:45.367 --> 08:46.467
IS SHARING INFORMATION
WITH THE DOMINION,

08:46.567 --> 08:47.701
  ESPECIALLY BEHIND OUR BACK.

08:47.801 --> 08:49.067
LOOK, SHE WOULDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO HURT US.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.634
NO, JESS, EVEN IF SHE THINKS
SHE'S DOING THE RIGHT THING,

08:50.734 --> 08:52.868
 THAT INFORMATION THAT SHE
 HAS CAN BE USED AGAINST US.

08:52.968 --> 08:54.300
 YEAH. AND ADAM.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.601
LOOK,
SHE MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.000
WE NEED TO FIND HER.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.501
  CAN YOU GET A FIX
  ON HER COMLINK?

09:02.767 --> 09:03.801
AS SOON AS I SAW IT,

09:03.901 --> 09:06.734
I STARTED TRACKING THE SAT-CAM
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.234
  SHE'S HEADING
  FOR THE CITY.

09:10.334 --> 09:11.534
YEAH.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.901
IF SHE IS MEETING SOMEONE,
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.567
 YEAH. LET'S GO.
 YOU STAY HERE.

09:14.667 --> 09:15.834
NO, NO, NO.
I'M IN THIS.

09:15.934 --> 09:17.634
YEAH, YOU'RE ALL OVER
THIS, BUDDY - FROM HERE.

09:17.734 --> 09:18.968
  THEY'RE AFTER YOUR
  GENETIC STRUCTURE.

09:19.067 --> 09:21.567
 I'M NOT GOING TO
 DELIVER YOU UP TO THEM.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.701
 WE'LL FIND HER.

09:45.968 --> 09:47.868
I DON'T SEE
MR. KILMARTIN.

09:47.968 --> 09:49.634
 YOU DON'T NEED HIM.

09:49.734 --> 09:51.167
  HERE.

09:51.267 --> 09:54.434
 I BROUGHT YOU EVERYTHING I
 COULD FIND OF ADAM'S RESEARCH.

09:54.534 --> 09:56.167
THAT WASN'T
THE ARRANGEMENT.

09:56.267 --> 09:58.567
 I'M NOT
 GIVING HIM UP.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.701
 <i>THAT IS THE
ARRANGEMENT.</i>

10:00.801 --> 10:02.300
 HE IS NOT GOING TO DIE

10:02.400 --> 10:05.300
 SO THE DOMINION CAN
 CONTROL ANOTHER ONE OF
 THEIR DAMNED SECRETS.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.167
I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

10:12.601 --> 10:13.667
 UH...

10:13.767 --> 10:15.601
HEY!

10:19.534 --> 10:20.934
 UGH... UH...

10:21.033 --> 10:23.300
 <rapid gunfire>

10:28.501 --> 10:31.601
 <loud crash>

10:31.701 --> 10:33.834
 UH!!

10:35.267 --> 10:39.067
THE SUBDERMAL GOVERNOR HAS
RENDERED YOUR POWERS INOPERABLE.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.934
SHAL,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.734
 GIVE ME MY EYES BACK.

11:02.834 --> 11:06.000
 MS. PIERCE, WE ARE DISAPPOINTED
 THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN

11:06.100 --> 11:10.434
 TO SIDE WITH MUTANT X
 IN THE CURRENT MATTER.

11:10.534 --> 11:13.234
 THE CURRENT MATTER HERE
 IS JESSE KILMARTIN'S LIFE.

11:13.334 --> 11:16.100
WHICH IS PART OF AN EXPERIMENT
WE BROUGHT INTO BEING.

11:16.200 --> 11:21.334
SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE
GENOMEX PROJECT WERE UNFORESEEN.

11:21.434 --> 11:22.968
SOME WERE UNFORTUNATE.

11:23.067 --> 11:25.367
  HUH, IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL
  DESTROYING A THOUSAND LIVES -

11:25.467 --> 11:26.767
UNFORTUNATE?

11:26.868 --> 11:28.300
OVERALL, THE EXPERIMENT
HAS GONE A LONG WAY

11:28.400 --> 11:31.000
TO ACCOMPLISHING
OUR OBJECTIVES.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.434
 WHICH ARE...?

11:32.534 --> 11:34.234
 THIS ORGANIZATION WAS FORMED

11:34.334 --> 11:36.701
 TO DIRECT THE SHAPE OF
 SCIENTIFIC EVOLUTION.

11:36.801 --> 11:40.634
 OVER TIME, WE REALIZED WE HAD
 A GREATER RESPONSIBILITY:

11:40.734 --> 11:43.868
TO DIRECT HUMAN PHYSICAL
EVOLUTION, AS WELL.

11:43.968 --> 11:45.133
 HUH...

11:45.234 --> 11:47.534
TELL ME, WHERE DO YOU
 FREAKS DRAW THE LINE, HUH?

11:47.634 --> 11:49.000
  RACIAL CLEANSING?

11:49.100 --> 11:51.868
YOU SEE ONLY THE TIP OF
THE ICEBERG OF WHAT WE DO.

11:51.968 --> 11:53.000
  OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.701
 I'M JUST ONE OF THE
 LITTLE LAB RATS.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.367
 YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.501
IT'S GOOD YOU MADE
YOURSELF AVAILABLE TO US.

11:58.601 --> 12:01.467
 ADAM MIGHT HAVE WORKED
 ON YOUR GENES, AS WELL.

12:01.567 --> 12:04.868
I'M GOING TO ORDER UP A SERIES
OF TESTS ON MS. PIERCE'S D.N.A.

12:04.968 --> 12:06.734
 THANK YOU, DOMINIQUE.

12:09.601 --> 12:14.367
 TELL ME, WHAT IF ADAM
 DIDN'T WORK ON ME, HUH?

12:14.467 --> 12:16.934
 GOING TO GO AFTER THE
 REST OF MUTANT X, AS WELL?

12:17.033 --> 12:19.334
 IF ADAM DIDN'T ADJUST
 YOUR GENETIC CODE,

12:19.434 --> 12:20.868
 YOU SHOULD WORRY FOR YOURSELF.

12:20.968 --> 12:22.167
ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS,

12:22.267 --> 12:25.701
 YOUR EXPIRY DATE
 IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING.

12:29.634 --> 12:30.701
I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE.

12:30.801 --> 12:31.868
 WHY?

12:31.968 --> 12:33.000
 THESE GUYS HAD POWER-
 PROOF SUITS ON.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.267
 IT WOULDN'T HAVE
 MADE ANY DIFFERENCE.

12:34.367 --> 12:35.734
BESIDES, THEY MIGHT HAVE
TRIED TO TAKE YOU, TOO.

12:35.834 --> 12:37.934
 YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
 TYPICAL LEX, ISN'T IT?

12:38.033 --> 12:39.167
DON'T ASK ANYBODY
FOR HELP,

12:39.267 --> 12:40.467
DON'T TELL ANYBODY
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

12:40.567 --> 12:41.801
YOU KNOW, I JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND

12:41.901 --> 12:43.534
WHY SHE GAVE THEM
THE INFORMATION
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

12:43.634 --> 12:45.000
LOOK, THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT WE FIND HER.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.968
YOU CAN ASK
QUESTIONS LATER.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.334
WELL, UNLESS YOU
SAVED THE RETURN ADDRESS

12:48.434 --> 12:49.767
 ON THE DOMINION
 CHRISTMAS CARD,

12:49.868 --> 12:51.133
IT'S GOING TO BE A
LITTLE HARDER THAN IT SEEMS.

12:51.234 --> 12:53.434
  JESS, DO YOU THINK
  YOU CAN FIND ADAM?

12:53.534 --> 12:55.200
 I MEAN, THEY'RE AFTER
 HIS INFORMATION, RIGHT?

12:55.300 --> 12:57.133
THAT'S WHY SHE MET THEM.
THAT'S WHY THEY TOOK HER.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.834
 HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO
 KNOWS HOW IT CONNECTS.

12:58.934 --> 13:02.100
 BESIDES, I WANT TO KNOW HOW
 YOU PASSED YOUR EXPIRY DATE.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.501
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:03.601 --> 13:04.801
 FIND ADAM?

13:04.901 --> 13:06.033
IT COULD TAKE A WHILE.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.667
WELL, YOU BETTER GET TO IT.
WE DON'T HAVE A WHILE.

13:08.767 --> 13:11.200
 CHOP CHOP!

13:17.000 --> 13:19.367
YOU KNOW, FOR AN OUTFIT
BENT ON WORLD DOMINATION,

13:19.467 --> 13:21.701
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE
FIRST THING ABOUT SECURITY.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.133
 NO? HOW'S THAT?

13:23.234 --> 13:31.200
 <fight sounds>

13:32.300 --> 13:33.601
YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT
A SUBDERMAL GOVERNOR

13:33.701 --> 13:35.934
 WAS GOING TO MAKE ME HARMLESS.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.200
 OKAY...

13:56.868 --> 13:58.601
 GOTCHA.

14:09.968 --> 14:11.200
 HEY.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.434
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:13.534 --> 14:16.767
 HUH, JUST DOING SOME RESEARCH.

14:16.868 --> 14:20.734
 YOU LOOKING
 AT OUR MEDICAL FILES.

14:20.834 --> 14:24.267
 YOU WANT TO KNOW IF WE GOT THE
 SAME TREATMENT AS JESSE DID?

14:24.367 --> 14:26.033
  YEAH WELL, IT'S
  IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.901
HE DID SO MANY
PROCEDURES ON ALL OF US.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.434
  WELL, WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS
  WAS HANGING OVER US, RIGHT?

14:34.534 --> 14:35.801
GUESS I JUST ALWAYS HOPED

14:35.901 --> 14:38.601
IT WOULDN'T COME BACK TO HAUNT
US UNTIL WE WERE OLD AND GREY.

14:38.701 --> 14:41.567
 BUT, KNOWING THAT JESSE'S
 ALREADY PASSED HIS EXPIRY DATE

14:41.667 --> 14:44.300
  KIND OF CHANGES ALL
  THAT, DOESN'T IT?

14:45.667 --> 14:49.133
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE ON
YOUR MIND, ISN'T THERE?

14:49.234 --> 14:51.934
REMEMBER THAT PRECOG THAT
WORKING WITH THE LINKS?

14:52.033 --> 14:55.000
 YEAH.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.667
 HE GAVE ME A PROPHECY.

14:57.767 --> 15:00.100
 HE SAID ONE OF US WILL FALL.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.367
 COME ON, YOU CAN'T PUT
 TOO MUCH FAITH IN THAT.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.267
  HIS PROPHECIES WERE
  ALL SO OBSCURE.

15:04.367 --> 15:07.434
 YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN OR
 WHERE IT MIGHT HAPPEN.

15:07.534 --> 15:08.968
  WE'RE NOT GOING TO
  SIT UNDER A CLOUD

15:09.067 --> 15:12.334
AND JUST WAIT
FOR IT TO HAPPEN, RIGHT?

15:12.434 --> 15:16.400
  YOU KNOW, BRENNAN,
  IF WE ARE DYING,

15:16.501 --> 15:20.167
  I DON'T WANT TO GO WITHOUT
  FINISHING WHAT WE STARTED.

15:20.267 --> 15:23.767
 YEAH, ME TOO.

15:23.868 --> 15:26.634
DO YOU THINK YOU REMEMBER
WHERE WE LEFT OFF?

15:26.734 --> 15:32.367
  OH, I THINK YOU COULD
  PROBABLY REFRESH MY MEMORY.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.601
  <gunshots>

16:26.601 --> 16:28.968
 <shot>
 UH...

16:30.767 --> 16:33.300
 TAKE HER AWAY.

16:42.133 --> 16:45.100
 ALL RIGHT, I'VE ELIMINATED ALL
 BUT ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES

16:45.200 --> 16:46.734
FOR ADAM'S LOCATION.

16:46.834 --> 16:49.667
SEE, ALL THE OTHERS WERE JUST...

16:49.767 --> 16:51.601
 OKAY, WHAT'S DIFFERENT
 ABOUT YOU TWO?

16:51.701 --> 16:53.634
WHAT? NOTHING.

16:53.734 --> 16:57.200
 YEAH... UM, WHAT WERE YOU
 SAYING ABOUT ADAM'S LOCATION?

16:57.300 --> 16:58.801
  WELL, UH...

16:58.901 --> 17:01.501
  I TRACED THE AGENCY WHOSE
  I.P. ADDRESS HE WAS USING.

17:01.601 --> 17:05.233
  IT BELONGED TO
  THE ASTRONOMICAL APPLICATIONS
  DIVISION OF THE MILITARY,

17:05.334 --> 17:07.733
 WHICH WAS FOLDED INTO
 NASA TWENTY YEARS AGO.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.666
  AND HOW DOES THAT HELP US?

17:09.767 --> 17:11.968
  WELL, BECAUSE THEY
  DIVESTED THEMSELVES

17:12.067 --> 17:14.400
 OF ALL THEIR HOLDINGS
 EXCEPT FOR ONE:

17:14.501 --> 17:16.032
THE SUMMIT RIDGE AIRPORT,

17:16.133 --> 17:17.968
  WHICH WAS ABANDONED
  A LONG TIME AGO.

17:18.067 --> 17:19.534
 I RAN A THERMAL SCAN
 OF THE AREA.

17:19.634 --> 17:21.968
 ONE OF THE BUILDINGS IS STILL
 BEING USED BY SOMEBODY.

17:22.067 --> 17:23.300
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:23.400 --> 17:24.901
  I THINK WE SHOULD
  GO FIND OUT

17:25.000 --> 17:27.968
 IF ADAM'S INTERESTED IN
 AERONAUTICS ALL OF A SUDDEN.

17:41.567 --> 17:43.767
DID YOU REALLY THINK
ONE PERSON COULD TAKE DOWN

17:43.868 --> 17:46.200
OUR WHOLE ORGANIZATION?

17:46.300 --> 17:47.334
 WELL, ANOTHER FEW SECONDS,

17:47.434 --> 17:49.567
 I'D HAVE HAD
 A PRETTY GOOD SHOT.

17:49.667 --> 17:52.734
I HAVE TO ASSUME YOU'RE
WORKING FOR ADAM?

17:52.834 --> 17:55.000
 UH... I'M NOT WORKING
 FOR ANYONE.

17:55.100 --> 17:58.968
 I... I'M ACTUALLY DOING THIS AS
 SOME KIND OF A PUBLIC SERVICE.

17:59.067 --> 18:01.634
WHAT DID YOU WANT
WITH THE CREATOR?

18:01.734 --> 18:03.934
  YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING AN
  EVENING OF CANDLELIGHT, WINE,

18:04.033 --> 18:05.834
 WORLD DOMINATION...

18:08.334 --> 18:11.167
SEEMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO ACQUIRE MR. KILMARTIN

18:11.267 --> 18:13.601
AND ADAM KANE
BY OUR OWN METHODS.

18:13.701 --> 18:18.601
UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR CHANCES OF
ARRIVING INTACT ARE LIMITED.

18:18.701 --> 18:19.934
  WAIT A MINUTE.
  YOU DON'T NEED JESSE.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.634
 YOU SAID YOU COULD
 EXPERIMENT ON ME!

18:21.734 --> 18:22.968
SORRY, MS PIERCE.

18:23.067 --> 18:26.033
OUR FINDINGS SHOW YOUR GENETIC
STRUCTURE HASN'T BEEN FIXED.

18:26.133 --> 18:27.968
SO YOU'RE OF LITTLE USE.

18:28.067 --> 18:31.267
BUT, IF YOU HELP US
FIND ADAM KANE,

18:31.367 --> 18:35.100
WHAT TIME YOU HAVE LEFT WILL
BE SPENT MORE COMFORTABLY.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.901
 WELL, I'D BE A LOT
 MORE COMFORTABLE

18:37.000 --> 18:39.167
  WITH MY FOOT
  DOWN YOUR THROAT.

18:39.267 --> 18:41.534
 YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS.
 YOU KNOW HER TRAINING.

18:41.634 --> 18:43.300
SHE'S NOT GOING TO TALK.

18:44.334 --> 18:45.634
IT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

18:45.734 --> 18:48.634
MUTANT X WILL ALREADY BE LOOKING
FOR ADAM KANE THEMSELVES.

18:48.734 --> 18:51.534
SO WITH ANY LUCK, YOUR FRIENDS
WILL BE JOINING YOU...

18:51.634 --> 18:54.033
WITHIN THE HOUR.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.567
ADAM, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING? IT'S US.

19:12.667 --> 19:15.567
WE CAME HERE TO WARN
YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.067
ADAM!

19:17.167 --> 19:18.567
 <i>ALL RIGHT.
 <i>COME UPSTAIRS.</i></i>

19:18.667 --> 19:21.300
 <i>I'LL DISABLE THE OTHER
 <i>SECURITY MEASURES.</i></i>

19:21.400 --> 19:23.300
  HERE WE GO.

19:32.334 --> 19:34.133
  ADAM.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.534
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE ABLE TO FIND ME.

19:37.634 --> 19:38.667
 WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY WE DID.

19:38.767 --> 19:40.367
THE DOMINION KNOWS YOU'RE ALIVE.

19:40.467 --> 19:41.501
IF WE CAN FIND YOU, SO CAN THEY.

19:41.601 --> 19:43.334
<sigh>

19:43.434 --> 19:44.567
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:44.667 --> 19:45.734
 LEXA WAS TAKEN.

19:45.834 --> 19:46.934
 IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
 TO DO WITH JESSE

19:47.033 --> 19:48.400
 LIVING PAST HIS
 DROP-DEAD DATE.

19:48.501 --> 19:49.534
 WHY DIDN'T YOU
 TELL ME YOU KNEW

19:49.634 --> 19:51.300
 THE ACTUAL DATE
 I WAS GOING TO DIE?

19:51.400 --> 19:52.767
WOULD IT HAVE HELPED?

19:52.868 --> 19:55.067
I'M DOING EVERYTHING
I CAN TO KEEP YOU ALIVE.

19:55.167 --> 19:57.033
 WELL, YOU COULD'VE
 TOLD US YOU SOLVED IT.

19:57.133 --> 20:00.000
WELL, UNTIL THIS MOMENT
I WASN'T SURE I HAD.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.534
 WHAT ABOUT
 THE REST OF US?

20:02.634 --> 20:03.934
WELL, THAT'S GOING
TO TAKE SOME TESTING

20:04.033 --> 20:06.300
TO FIGURE OUT WHICH MANIPULATION
OF THE D.N.A. STABILIZED IT.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.067
 NO! NO MORE TESTS.
 NO MORE EXPERIMENTS.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.934
 WE'RE TIRED OF BEING
 POKED AND PRODDED.

20:11.033 --> 20:13.167
 COME ON, ADAM, WE CAN'T
 LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE.

20:13.267 --> 20:14.400
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I UNDERSTAND.

20:14.501 --> 20:15.834
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO START
THROWING OUT GUESSES.

20:15.934 --> 20:17.634
 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
 HOW ANY OF US FEEL!

20:17.734 --> 20:21.200
 LOOK, THE DOMINION'S AFTER
 THE SAME INFORMATION.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.868
 THAT'S WHY THEY TOOK LEXA.

20:22.968 --> 20:25.701
 MAYBE WE CAN USE THAT
 INFORMATION TO BARTER HER BACK.

20:25.801 --> 20:27.968
NO. NO.

20:28.067 --> 20:29.400
 NO?

20:29.501 --> 20:33.133
  ADAM WE'RE NOT JUST
  GOING TO ABANDON HER.

20:33.234 --> 20:35.534
WHO GETS HURT IF THEY
KNOW HOW TO HELP PEOPLE?

20:35.634 --> 20:37.000
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO HELP PEOPLE!

20:37.100 --> 20:39.534
THIS IS ABOUT
 <i>TOTAL MANIPULATION.</i>

20:39.634 --> 20:40.934
THIS IS ABOUT
GIVING THE DOMINION

20:41.033 --> 20:43.534
EVERYTHING THEY WOULD
NEED TO CREATE HUMAN BEINGS

20:43.634 --> 20:47.234
MADE TO ORDER AND EXTEND
THEIR LIVES INDEFINITELY.

20:47.334 --> 20:49.534
THIS IS ABOUT THE END
OF THE HUMAN RACE --

20:49.634 --> 20:51.567
 THIS IS ALSO ABOUT
 THE END OF LEXA!
- AS WE KNOW IT!

20:51.667 --> 20:55.701
 Computer:
  <i>INCOMING AIRCRAFT.
  <i>INCOMING AIRCRAFT.</i></i>

20:57.100 --> 21:01.367
  <helicopter sounds>

21:07.167 --> 21:08.033
 THERE'S A STAIRWAY IN THE BACK.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.200
IT'LL GET US OUT.

21:18.234 --> 21:20.200
 AAHHH!

21:20.300 --> 21:22.734
  UH!

21:22.834 --> 21:27.501
UH!  UH!!

21:39.567 --> 21:41.100
WHY DID HE STOP?

21:41.200 --> 21:42.601
HE DID WHAT ANY OF US WOULD DO,

21:42.701 --> 21:44.801
 AND GAVE HIMSELF UP SO WE'D
 HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AWAY.

21:44.901 --> 21:46.334
WELL, WE HAVE TO GO BACK.

21:46.434 --> 21:48.000
 THERE MIGHT STILL BE
 A TRAIL WE CAN FOLLOW.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.000
NO.
THEY WON'T LEAVE ONE.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.701
  WELL, SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
  TO DO? JUST WRITE HIM OFF?

21:53.801 --> 21:55.534
IS THAT WHAT YOU
THINK I'M ABOUT?

21:55.634 --> 21:58.934
AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THOUGH,
I'D JUST GIVE UP ON JESSE?

21:59.033 --> 22:00.000
NO.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.501
WE'RE GONNA GET HIM.

22:01.601 --> 22:04.334
BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET HIM IN
THE LAST WAY THEY'D EXPECT.

22:04.434 --> 22:07.200
WE'RE GOING INTO THE
DOMINION'S HEADQUARTERS.

22:18.267 --> 22:20.901
YOU DISAPPOINT ME, LEXA.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.100
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D DO
SOMETHING THIS STUPID.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.334
 NEITHER DID I.

22:25.434 --> 22:27.767
 I GUESS I JUST LOST
 MY TASTE FOR BULL.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.434
 I HAD TO DO
 SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

22:29.534 --> 22:30.868
YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL.

22:30.968 --> 22:32.300
PEOPLE LIKE US
DON'T GET TIED UP

22:32.400 --> 22:34.234
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S
IDEAS OF MORALITY.

22:34.334 --> 22:35.534
NO - I JUST LIKE TO KNOW

22:35.634 --> 22:38.033
THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING
AND WHO I'M DOING IT FOR.

22:38.133 --> 22:39.634
THE DOMINION'S STILL PLAYING
LIKE THEY'RE THE GOOD GUYS,

22:39.734 --> 22:41.601
  AND WE BOTH KNOW THEY'RE NOT.

22:41.701 --> 22:42.834
GOOD IS A RELATIVE TERM.

22:42.934 --> 22:44.601
  PHTTT.
  <laughter>

22:44.701 --> 22:46.434
  WHY DON'T YOU TRY SELLING
  THAT RATIONALIZATION

22:46.534 --> 22:48.167
LIKE YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

22:48.267 --> 22:50.734
THEY'VE PERVERTED EVERYTHING
THEY SUPPOSEDLY STOOD FOR

22:50.834 --> 22:52.501
AND ADAM KNOWS THAT.

22:52.601 --> 22:55.467
 THAT'S WHY THE CREATOR
 WANTS TO SILENCE HIM.

22:55.567 --> 22:56.734
THE TRUTH ABOUT
ADAM AND THE DOMINION

22:56.834 --> 23:00.100
IS FAR MORE COMPLICATED
THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW.

23:01.868 --> 23:03.801
YOUR FRIENDS AT MUTANT X
MANAGED TO TAKE HIM

23:03.901 --> 23:06.567
FROM RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES
A SHORT WHILE AGO.

23:06.667 --> 23:09.167
WE BELIEVE THEY'VE TAKEN
HIM BACK TO SANCTUARY.

23:09.267 --> 23:11.267
I NEED TO KNOW
THE ACCESS CODES.

23:11.367 --> 23:13.901
HUH, YOU SHOULD KNOW
ME BETTER THAN THAT.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.734
 NOTHING'S GOING TO
 MAKE ME TALK.

23:16.834 --> 23:18.834
THAT WAS BEFORE.

23:18.934 --> 23:21.801
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'VE ALLOWED
YOURSELF TO BECOME... WEAK.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.601
 HAVE I?

23:23.701 --> 23:26.000
BRING IT ON.

23:34.133 --> 23:36.167
  OH MY GOD.

23:36.267 --> 23:38.000
HE'S GOING TO DIE, LEXA.

23:38.100 --> 23:41.534
IT CAN BE RELATIVELY PAINLESS,
OR IT CAN BE VERY PAINFUL.

23:41.634 --> 23:44.300
THE CHOICE IS YOURS NOW.

23:45.534 --> 23:48.000
 DON'T DO THIS, PLEASE.

23:50.567 --> 23:53.367
YOU KNOW HOW
TO STOP IT, LEXA.

23:59.033 --> 24:00.868
 DO IT.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.667
 LEXA?

24:14.367 --> 24:22.801
  <screaming>

24:31.200 --> 24:32.934
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

24:33.033 --> 24:34.534
 THE SECURITY SYSTEMS
 ARE FULLY OPERATIONAL,

24:34.634 --> 24:37.434
 SO EVEN IF THEY DECIDE
 TO LAUNCH A FULL-SCALE ATTACK,

24:37.534 --> 24:39.200
 WE SHOULD BE SAFE FOR A WHILE.

24:39.300 --> 24:41.067
ADAM, WE HAVE NO IDEA OF
WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF.

24:41.167 --> 24:42.367
THE DOMINION'S ABOUT
THE BIGGEST SECRET

24:42.467 --> 24:43.334
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.

24:43.434 --> 24:44.834
  OR NOT KNOWN.

24:44.934 --> 24:46.200
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
FIND THEIR HEADQUARTERS?

24:46.300 --> 24:47.767
 WELL, I'M HOPING THAT
 LEXA'S PRIVATE FILES

24:47.868 --> 24:51.434
 WILL LEAD US BACK TO WHATEVER
 SHE WAS PLANNING TO DO.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.968
BUT WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG?
WHAT IF SHE DID BETRAY US?

24:55.067 --> 24:57.734
HEY - YOU DON'T EVEN
WANT TO THINK THAT.

24:57.834 --> 24:59.734
 BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT JESSE
 MIGHT ALREADY BE DEAD.

24:59.834 --> 25:06.467
  <screaming>

25:06.567 --> 25:08.167
I WAS WRONG.

25:08.267 --> 25:11.667
MAYBE YOU ARE STRONG
ENOUGH TO WATCH HIM SUFFER.

25:14.567 --> 25:17.133
  <louder screaming>

25:17.234 --> 25:18.834
 OKAY, STOP!

25:18.934 --> 25:20.133
  FINE.

25:20.234 --> 25:22.100
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.801
DON'T.
DO NOT TELL THEM.

25:25.901 --> 25:29.267
 THE HANGAR BAY IS AUTO-SYNCHED
 TO THE DOUBLE HELIX,

25:29.367 --> 25:32.734
 BUT THE GROUND ENTRANCE
 IS STILL ACCESSIBLE.

25:32.834 --> 25:37.067
 YOU BROADCAST A 5.47 GIGAHERTZ.

25:37.167 --> 25:39.234
  PASSWORD...

25:39.334 --> 25:42.634
  IS 4853...

25:42.734 --> 25:44.467
 9949.

25:44.567 --> 25:46.133
HOW COULD YOU DO IT?

25:46.234 --> 25:48.667
  LEXA, YOU'VE SOLD US OUT.

25:48.767 --> 25:51.634
YOU REALIZE WHAT'LL HAPPEN
TO YOU AND TO HIM

25:51.734 --> 25:54.367
IF THIS INFORMATION
ISN'T CORRECT?

25:54.467 --> 25:58.934
AS A SAMPLE, HE'S JUST AS
USEFUL DEAD AS HE IS ALIVE.

25:59.868 --> 26:02.434
 WELL, I GUESS YOU WERE RIGHT.

26:02.534 --> 26:05.367
I HAVE GONE SOFT.

26:05.467 --> 26:07.601
 DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

26:14.033 --> 26:19.767
  OH... OH...

26:26.067 --> 26:29.501
  AH! UH-OHH!

26:39.300 --> 26:43.901
 OHHH.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.367
YOU REALIZE THEY'RE
GOING TO FIGURE OUT

26:45.467 --> 26:50.501
THOSE CODES ARE BOGUS IN ABOUT,
OH, TWENTY MINUTES.

26:50.601 --> 26:55.534
 WELL, MAYBE BY THEN WE'LL HAVE
 A FEW MORE SURPRISES FOR THEM.

26:55.634 --> 26:57.267
<coughs>

26:57.367 --> 27:00.701
 I DOWNLOADED A CORE KILLER
 VIRUS INTO THE DOMINION SYSTEM.

27:00.801 --> 27:01.934
 ANY MINUTE NOW,

27:02.033 --> 27:04.100
EVERY COMPUTER CONTROLLED
SYSTEM IN THIS BUILDING

27:04.200 --> 27:05.467
SHOULD FREAK OUT,

27:05.567 --> 27:08.300
INCLUDING THESE
SUBDERMAL GOVERNORS.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.734
HUH...

27:09.834 --> 27:12.067
"SHOULD" FREAK OUT?

27:12.167 --> 27:14.234
<laughs>

27:14.334 --> 27:16.934
YOU DO REALIZE THAT OUR
LIVES ARE DEPENDING ON THIS?

27:17.033 --> 27:18.200
 HUH...

27:18.300 --> 27:20.100
 DO YOU HAVE A BETTER PLAN?

27:22.067 --> 27:24.367
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

27:24.467 --> 27:26.534
THEY SAID THEY'D
KILL ALL OF MUTANT X

27:26.634 --> 27:29.033
 IF I DIDN'T DELIVER YOU UP.

27:29.133 --> 27:31.667
  SO I FIGURED I'D GIVE UP SOME
  OF ADAM'S RESEARCH, YOU KNOW,

27:31.767 --> 27:34.300
 JUST TO GET THEM OFF OUR BACKS.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.634
ONCE I WAS IN HERE,

27:35.734 --> 27:37.334
I REALIZED THE ONLY WAY OUT
WOULD BE TO GET TO THEIR BOSS,

27:37.434 --> 27:39.567
  THIS GUY THEY
  CALL THE CREATOR.

27:39.667 --> 27:41.801
  I WAS THIS CLOSE!

27:44.267 --> 27:48.067
THIS WAS A SUICIDE
MISSION TO BEGIN WITH.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.634
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.

27:50.734 --> 27:53.601
 NOW, WOULD YOU HAVE
 LET ME GO, REALLY?

27:53.701 --> 27:56.100
I DON'T KNOW.

27:56.200 --> 27:59.634
BUT YOU SHOULD'VE TRUSTED ME
ENOUGH TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION.

27:59.734 --> 28:02.434
  WELL, I PROMISE THEN,

28:02.534 --> 28:03.934
 THE NEXT TIME SOMEONE'S
 TRYING TO KILL US,

28:04.033 --> 28:06.167
YOU'LL BE THE
FIRST TO KNOW, OKAY?

28:06.267 --> 28:11.033
<laughter>
<coughing>

28:15.801 --> 28:17.667
BRENNAN, SHALIMAR,
COME HERE.

28:17.767 --> 28:19.701
I FOUND SOMETHING.

28:19.801 --> 28:21.634
SOMEBODY ACCESSED THE
SANCTUARY'S COMPUTER FILES

28:21.734 --> 28:23.567
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.

28:23.667 --> 28:26.100
LEXA'S FILES.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.501
 WHO? THE DOMINION?

28:27.601 --> 28:28.667
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT WHOEVER IT IS,

28:28.767 --> 28:31.267
THEY DOWNLOADED A PROGRAM
CALLED KANE MUTINY.

28:31.367 --> 28:32.868
LOOKS TO BE SOME
KIND OF A VIRUS.

28:32.968 --> 28:35.634
 WHY WOULD SOMEONE BREAK INTO
 OUR SYSTEM TO STEAL A VIRUS?

28:35.734 --> 28:37.534
 <beep>

28:37.634 --> 28:38.434
 ADAM...

28:38.534 --> 28:39.634
IF YOU'VE GOT THIS FAR,

28:39.734 --> 28:41.534
 YOU KNOW WHERE I AM
 AND WHAT I'VE DONE.

28:41.634 --> 28:43.501
AND THIS IS WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

28:43.601 --> 28:45.267
 I'M TAKING THE FIGHT TO THEM.

28:45.367 --> 28:47.334
 I'M GOING AFTER THE CREATOR.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.834
 I WASN'T ABLE
 TO SAVE MY BROTHER,

28:48.934 --> 28:51.534
 BUT I AM NOT GOING
 TO LET THEM TAKE YOU.

28:51.634 --> 28:53.534
 IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,
 DON'T LOOK FOR ME,

28:53.634 --> 28:56.000
 JUST RUN FAR. RUN FAST.

28:57.067 --> 28:58.167
 SHE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

28:58.267 --> 29:00.334
WHO THE HELL IS THIS
CREATOR GUY?

29:00.434 --> 29:01.868
WELL, HE'S A...

29:01.968 --> 29:04.300
HE'S A MYTHICAL FIGURE.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.534
I MEAN, SOME SAY THAT HE'S BEEN
SECRETLY RUNNING THE DOMINION

29:06.634 --> 29:08.434
SINCE THE 1800S.

29:08.534 --> 29:09.634
SOME SAY EVEN LONGER.

29:09.734 --> 29:10.934
 THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

29:11.033 --> 29:12.133
I KNOW. BUT LOOK,

29:12.234 --> 29:13.133
HOW CAN THE WORD IMPOSSIBLE

29:13.234 --> 29:14.868
HAVE ANY MEANING TO ANY OF US?

29:14.968 --> 29:17.067
WHATEVER HE IS,
HE'S THEIR HEART.

29:17.167 --> 29:18.167
HE'S THEIR SOUL.

29:18.267 --> 29:20.834
HIS PRINCIPLES
DICTATE THEIR ACTIONS.

29:20.934 --> 29:22.067
 YEAH, WELL, WHEREVER SHE IS,

29:22.167 --> 29:24.267
  LOOKS LIKE SHE
  HAS ACCESS TO HIM.

29:24.367 --> 29:27.534
AND HER COMMUNICATION
SHOULD LEAD US TO HER.

29:27.634 --> 29:29.601
I'LL TRACK IT ON THE WAY.

29:29.701 --> 29:32.000
 <alarm>

29:32.100 --> 29:34.501
WE HAVE COMPANY.

29:34.601 --> 29:36.100
 IT'S THE DOMINION!

29:36.200 --> 29:38.567
LOOKS LIKE THEY DON'T
HAVE THE ACCESS CODES.

29:38.667 --> 29:40.501
BUT THOSE DOORS ARE NOT
GOING TO HOLD THEM VERY LONG.

29:40.601 --> 29:42.167
CAN YOU GET TO THE HELIX,
UPLOAD THE INFORMATION?

29:42.267 --> 29:44.033
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THEM
OFF AS LONG AS WE CAN.

29:44.133 --> 29:46.200
<thunderous bang>

29:46.300 --> 29:47.901
DON'T TRY TO ENGAGE THEM!

29:48.000 --> 29:50.167
SLOW THEM DOWN!

29:53.601 --> 29:56.834
<loud explosion>

29:56.934 --> 29:58.667
  THEY'RE BRINGING THE
  PLACE DOWN AROUND US.

29:58.767 --> 29:59.801
LET'S SPLIT.

29:59.901 --> 30:01.300
<gunfire>

30:12.234 --> 30:13.734
  ALRIGHT, GO TO THE HELIX.
  I'LL CATCH UP.

30:13.834 --> 30:16.767
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.
COME ON!

30:19.067 --> 30:21.701
<loud explosions>

30:25.067 --> 30:30.634
<gunfire>

30:30.734 --> 30:31.868
WE CAN'T STOP THEM!

30:31.968 --> 30:33.000
THEY'RE TOO POWERFUL.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.734
WE GOT TO MAKE IT
TO THE HELIX.

30:38.534 --> 30:46.701
 <loud gunfire>

30:46.801 --> 30:49.000
COME ON.

30:51.434 --> 30:56.167
 <explosion>

30:56.267 --> 30:58.200
 SHAL!!!

31:00.434 --> 31:02.367
 SHAL!!!

31:12.701 --> 31:16.834
  <explosion>

31:16.934 --> 31:24.467
 <alarm>

31:24.567 --> 31:26.501
SHAL, YOU OKAY?

31:26.601 --> 31:28.801
 UHH...

31:28.901 --> 31:30.901
COME ON, WE GOTTA MOVE.
THE PLACE IS GOING TO BLOW.

31:31.000 --> 31:42.300
 <alarm>

31:42.400 --> 31:44.834
LET'S GO!

31:46.634 --> 31:48.901
ALL RIGHT, BRENNAN,
TAKE THE CONTROLS.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.901
TWO DOMINION CHOPPERS ARE
WAITING FOR US OUTSIDE.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.167
HOLD ON.

32:05.133 --> 32:06.701
  <laughter>

32:06.801 --> 32:08.467
 THEY'RE STILL WONDERING
 WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

32:08.567 --> 32:10.334
I'VE TRACED LEXA'S LOCATION

32:10.434 --> 32:12.901
TO AN INSTALLATION
JUST NORTH OF THE CITY.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.234
 ONLY QUESTION IS, WHAT THE HELL
 DO WE DO ONCE WE GET THERE?

32:15.334 --> 32:16.901
WELL, WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHO'S WAITING FOR US.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.167
ALL WE'VE GOT IS THE
ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

32:19.267 --> 32:21.968
LET'S JUST HOPE THEY'RE
THE ONES BEING SURPRISED.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.968
 <sigh>

32:26.734 --> 32:30.000
SOMETHING I WANT YOU
TO KNOW.

32:30.100 --> 32:33.133
 THIS ISN'T GOING TO
 MAKE ME CRY, IS IT?

32:33.234 --> 32:35.167
  NO.

32:39.901 --> 32:41.567
BECAUSE IF I DIE
WITHOUT SAYING THIS, I -

32:41.667 --> 32:43.234
 SEE, THERE YOU GO.

32:43.334 --> 32:44.767
AND ME WITHOUT
MY HANDKERCHIEF.

32:44.868 --> 32:46.734
  I TELL YOU...

32:46.834 --> 32:49.367
YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME THAT I
TRY TO TALK TO YOU STRAIGHT UP,

32:49.467 --> 32:52.033
YOU TURN IT INTO A JOKE.

32:52.133 --> 32:53.601
 JESS, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

32:53.701 --> 32:56.167
 YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
 A CLOSED BOOK. THAT'S WHY.

32:56.267 --> 32:57.200
OH, OKAY.

32:57.300 --> 33:00.167
YEAH, JUST FORGET
I SAID ANYTHING.

33:02.267 --> 33:04.667
  JESS.

33:04.767 --> 33:06.701
 I CARE ABOUT YOU, TOO.

33:06.801 --> 33:08.734
 AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIE.

33:08.834 --> 33:10.767
 WE ARE WALKING OUT OF HERE.

33:10.868 --> 33:12.133
 AND I TELL YOU, WHEN WE DO,

33:12.234 --> 33:13.734
 WE'RE GOING TO
 TAKE THIS WHOLE DAMN PLACE

33:13.834 --> 33:16.067
 DOWN AROUND THEIR EARS.

33:24.367 --> 33:26.968
SO, I TRUST THEY GAVE
YOU A GOOD FIGHT?

33:27.067 --> 33:32.000
 AS YOU UNDOUBTEDLY ANTICIPATED,
 WE LOST SEVERAL OPERATIVES.

33:32.100 --> 33:33.167
THEY GOT AWAY?

33:33.267 --> 33:34.534
TEMPORARILY.

33:34.634 --> 33:38.667
THE CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU ARE
ALREADY BEING DISCUSSED.

33:40.133 --> 33:42.167
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW...

33:42.267 --> 33:45.767
 I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE WAY
 THINGS TURNED OUT, LEXA.

33:45.868 --> 33:48.834
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO, UH,

33:48.934 --> 33:50.734
STAY AWAY FROM
PERSONAL FEELINGS.

33:50.834 --> 33:53.868
I GUESS NO ONE'S IMMUNE.

33:53.968 --> 33:55.534
YOU CAN STOP THIS,
YOU KNOW.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.167
  IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

33:58.267 --> 33:59.434
I GUESS THE ENDS DON'T MATTER

33:59.534 --> 34:02.000
IF YOU'RE ALL ABOUT
DOING THE EASY THING.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.667
THE EASY THING WOULD'VE BEEN

34:04.767 --> 34:07.467
 TO KILL THE RIVAL
 AGENT WHO TOOK MY LEGS.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.567
 INSTEAD I TOOK INTO ACCOUNT
 THE FACT THAT HER MIND

34:09.667 --> 34:11.766
WAS BEING CONTROLLED
BY AN IMPLANT,

34:11.868 --> 34:15.833
 AND WORKED TO BRING HER
 INTO THIS ORGANIZATION.

34:16.833 --> 34:19.234
YOU'RE LYING.

34:19.333 --> 34:21.801
  I NEVER BLAMED YOU, LEXA.

34:21.900 --> 34:24.833
  I'VE GIVEN UP MUCH FOR
  THIS ORGANIZATION'S ENDS,

34:24.934 --> 34:26.266
AND FOR YOU.

34:26.367 --> 34:29.833
  I WON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

34:32.868 --> 34:34.967
OKAY, NOW CAN I WORRY?

34:36.167 --> 34:38.934
  YEAH, MAYBE A LITTLE.

34:45.734 --> 34:47.601
ALL RIGHT.

34:47.701 --> 34:50.701
THE LOCATION LEXA'S CONNECTION
CAME FROM IS COMING UP IN...

34:50.801 --> 34:52.333
THIRTY SECONDS.

34:53.868 --> 34:56.033
I'M GONNA SWITCH
HER TO STEALTH.

34:56.132 --> 34:58.100
 BRING HER DOWN ON THE ROOF.

35:03.968 --> 35:05.000
 GOT IT.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.100
GOOD.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.601
ALRIGHT, BRING HER
DOWN AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN.

35:07.701 --> 35:09.367
I'VE SET UP A JAMMING
FIELD AROUND THE SHIP.

35:09.467 --> 35:11.033
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
MAKE IT INTO THE BUILDING

35:11.133 --> 35:12.868
COMPLETELY UNDETECTED.

35:12.968 --> 35:15.100
 BREN, YOU OKAY
 TO DO THIS?

35:15.200 --> 35:17.701
  YEAH.

35:17.801 --> 35:20.667
  ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THIS IS
  ALL GOING TO BE OVER TONIGHT.

35:22.167 --> 35:24.367
NEXT STOP: HEART
OF THE DOMINION.

35:25.901 --> 35:28.267
OKAY, I THOUGHT THIS VIRUS OF
YOURS WAS GOING TO KICK IN.

35:28.367 --> 35:31.167
IT WILL.

35:34.534 --> 35:36.601
NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME.

35:36.701 --> 35:40.501
AFTER IT'S DONE, MOVE THE
REMAINS TO REFRIGERATION.

35:40.601 --> 35:42.400
WE WANT TO
AVOID TISSUE DAMAGE.

35:42.501 --> 35:44.300
 OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

35:44.400 --> 35:57.968
<beeping>

35:58.067 --> 36:01.167
 LOOKS LIKE YOUR
 VIRUS CAUGHT.

36:04.033 --> 36:05.667
  KILL THEM!

36:05.767 --> 36:09.267
 <loud gunfire>

36:11.634 --> 36:18.801
 <loud gunfire>

36:23.300 --> 36:24.467
I GUESS DOING THE EASY THING

36:24.567 --> 36:26.634
WILL HAVE TO
WAIT FOR ANOTHER DAY.

36:26.734 --> 36:28.601
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW, LEXA.

36:28.701 --> 36:31.033
I HAVE TO BE
FAR AWAY FROM HERE.

36:32.467 --> 36:33.467
HEY - WAIT A MINUTE.

36:33.567 --> 36:35.567
 YOU KNOW,
 I JUST REALIZED...

36:35.667 --> 36:37.033
 I NEVER KNEW YOUR NAME.

36:37.133 --> 36:39.200
LET'S NOT
SPOIL A GOOD THING.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.934
WE'LL MEET AGAIN.

36:47.634 --> 36:48.901
  LET'S GO.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.968
 NO, NOT YET.

36:51.067 --> 36:53.367
 FIRST WE GET
 THE CREATOR.

36:57.968 --> 36:59.601
SOMETHING'S GOING
ON IN THE BUILDING.

36:59.701 --> 37:01.367
I HEAR ALARMS.

37:01.467 --> 37:03.400
  IS THAT LEXA'S VIRUS?

37:03.501 --> 37:05.300
WE SHOULD GET IN THERE.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.234
  ADAM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:07.334 --> 37:09.534
CREATING A LITTLE DIVERSION
IN CASE WE'RE CAUGHT.

37:09.634 --> 37:11.133
USING THE HELIX TO
GET THEIR ATTENTION?

37:11.234 --> 37:12.567
WELL,
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

37:12.667 --> 37:14.334
I'M GOING TO
BLOW IT UP.

37:14.434 --> 37:15.801
  WHAT?

37:15.901 --> 37:18.434
IT'S NO GOOD TO
US IF WE'RE DEAD.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.634
THIS WAY.

37:37.534 --> 37:40.400
  DOWN ON THE FLOOR!
  GET DOWN!

37:40.501 --> 37:44.133
OKAY, YOUR PLAY.
WHAT NOW?

37:47.033 --> 37:48.334
 TAKE THEM OUT.

37:48.434 --> 37:51.200
  <gunshots>

37:53.234 --> 37:54.934
 NICE SHOOTING, BOYS.

37:57.534 --> 37:59.734
LEXA! JESSE!

37:59.834 --> 38:01.968
  GUESS YOU DIDN'T NEED
  OUR HELP AFTER ALL.

38:02.067 --> 38:03.000
 ALRIGHT, HURRY.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.367
 THEY'LL BE SENDING
 REINFORCEMENTS.

38:09.267 --> 38:10.667
ALRIGHT.

38:10.767 --> 38:13.400
 LET'S GO SEE THE MAN
 BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

38:29.367 --> 38:36.067
WELL, PART OF THE PRICE YOU
PAY FOR CHASING IMMORTALITY.

38:36.167 --> 38:40.767
 WHEN I THINK OF HOW HARD
 I TRIED TO GET YOU HERE...

38:40.868 --> 38:44.067
 AND THERE YOU ARE...
 YOU'VE DELIVERED YOURSELF.

38:44.167 --> 38:46.501
I'M HARDER TO KILL THIS WAY.

38:46.601 --> 38:48.267
 OH, NO, NO, NO.

38:48.367 --> 38:53.934
  BELIEVE ME, NO ONE
  INTENDED TO KILL YOU.

38:54.033 --> 38:57.167
I TRIED TO DELIVER
YOU TO YOUR DESTINY.

38:57.267 --> 38:59.868
AND WHAT WOULD YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

38:59.968 --> 39:02.968
 I'VE SHAPED EVERY
 FACET OF YOUR LIFE,

39:03.067 --> 39:04.834
 EVERYTHING YOU'VE STUDIED,

39:04.934 --> 39:07.100
 EVERYWHERE
 YOU'VE WORKED.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.901
EVERYONE YOU'VE WORKED WITH.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.968
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

39:14.067 --> 39:19.834
 THE HUMAN RACE IS AN
 IMPERFECT THING, ADAM.

39:19.934 --> 39:26.868
WEAK CREATURES EVOLVING
RANDOMLY IN AN UNCONTROLLED WAY.

39:26.968 --> 39:29.534
  WITHOUT ANY ORDER AT ALL.

39:29.634 --> 39:33.467
 AND I KNEW THAT
 WE COULD DO BETTER.

39:33.567 --> 39:37.400
  BUT I WAS RUNNING OUT
  OF TIME, YOU SEE...

39:40.634 --> 39:45.701
AND THAT'S WHY
I CLONED MYSELF.

39:45.801 --> 39:48.534
  I SPENT A HUNDRED
  AND SIXTY YEARS

39:48.634 --> 39:52.300
 WORKING ON THIS PROJECT ALONE.

39:52.400 --> 39:57.467
 BUT I NEEDED HELP.

39:57.567 --> 39:59.400
I HAD PARENTS...

39:59.501 --> 40:01.667
 MICHAEL, CAROL.

40:01.767 --> 40:05.400
LOYAL EMPLOYEES.

40:05.501 --> 40:08.234
  AND JUST WHEN I
  WAS READY TO CALL YOU

40:08.334 --> 40:10.834
 AND LET YOU TAKE THE NEXT STEP

40:10.934 --> 40:14.534
YOU DISAPPEARED.

40:17.734 --> 40:20.734
 NOW YOU KNOW THE PAST.

40:20.834 --> 40:26.467
BUT FROM HERE WE
CREATE THE FUTURE...

40:45.601 --> 40:47.801
ADAM, WE NEED TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

40:47.901 --> 40:49.601
  NO, WE'VE GOT TO
  TAKE HIM WITH US.

40:49.701 --> 40:52.501
  HE'S GOT WHAT I'VE BEEN
  WORKING TOWARD MY WHOLE LIFE.

40:52.601 --> 40:55.367
HE'S LYING TO YOU, ADAM.
YOU DON'T NEED HIM.

40:55.467 --> 40:57.467
ADAM, WATCH OUT!

41:01.000 --> 41:02.834
UH!

41:02.934 --> 41:06.267
  GET THE CREATOR
  AND KANE TO SAFETY!

41:06.367 --> 41:08.000
  NO!

41:11.267 --> 41:13.567
  KILL THEM.

41:14.701 --> 41:17.601
 JESSE!

41:18.634 --> 41:22.067
<loud explosion>

41:22.167 --> 41:24.901
 GET IN! GET IN!

41:28.334 --> 41:29.834
  GO!

41:29.934 --> 41:30.868
 RUN!

41:30.968 --> 41:33.667
 HURRY!

41:42.334 --> 41:45.567
  <explosion>

41:47.567 --> 41:49.167
 WHERE THE HELL DO WE GO NOW?

41:49.267 --> 41:50.801
 YEAH, WELL,
 WE NEED TO FIND ADAM.

41:50.901 --> 41:52.067
 I MEAN, EVERYBODY HERE,
 EXCEPT JESSE,

41:52.167 --> 41:53.567
  IS LIVING UNDER
  A DEATH SENTENCE.

41:53.667 --> 41:55.000
 YEAH, BUT SANCTUARY IS GONE,
 THE HELIX IS GONE,

41:55.100 --> 41:56.501
 THE... THE DOMINION...

41:56.601 --> 41:57.734
  NO, NO, NO.

41:57.834 --> 41:59.567
THEY THINK THEY'VE WON.
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

41:59.667 --> 42:01.801
WILL BE IF WE DON'T MOVE.

42:01.901 --> 42:03.801
COME ON!

42:04.305 --> 42:10.773
