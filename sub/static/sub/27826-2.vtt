WEBVTT

00:12.041 --> 00:13.875
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
-Okay. All right.

00:14.291 --> 00:17.083
Ambassador, how do you feel
about the diplomatic response

00:17.166 --> 00:19.917
to Jamal Khashoggi's murder
at the hands of the Saudis?

00:20.750 --> 00:22.750
The Trump administration
response?

00:22.834 --> 00:24.208
BILL: I guess that's what
they mean, yeah.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.709
-Pathetic. Horrible. Awful.
-BILL: Yeah, well...

00:26.792 --> 00:28.000
(APPLAUSE)

00:28.083 --> 00:31.000
We-- We can engage with
autocrats when we have to

00:31.083 --> 00:32.333
in our national interest,

00:32.417 --> 00:34.709
that doesn't mean we have to
check our values at the door.

00:34.792 --> 00:36.667
-BILL: Right.
-I knew Jamal,
I worked with him.

00:36.750 --> 00:39.291
He was not some
radical revolutionary,

00:39.375 --> 00:40.709
he was trying to do
the right thing.

00:40.792 --> 00:44.041
And when we do that, then we
undermine our values

00:44.125 --> 00:45.792
when we want to stand up
for democracy.

00:45.875 --> 00:50.834
So, you know, right now,
these events happening
in Venezuela, uh, you know,

00:50.917 --> 00:53.208
we have stood up for
the opposition there,

00:53.291 --> 00:56.750
I support that, but it looks
to the rest of the world

00:56.834 --> 00:59.792
like hypocrisy when we do
things like that
in Saudi Arabia.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.875
-Right, yeah, and it was...
-(APPLAUSE)

01:01.959 --> 01:03.959
...only a few months ago
and it's...

01:04.291 --> 01:08.458
I don't hear about it anymore.
It's not like he's out of power
or anything happened to him.

01:08.542 --> 01:11.625
-Remember that moment when Putin
and the Saudi crown prince...
-BILL: Yes!

01:11.709 --> 01:13.208
...were in the same room
and they high-fived each--

01:13.291 --> 01:14.959
Like, "Hey, we're both murdering
journalists now,

01:15.041 --> 01:17.291
-welcome to the murdering
journalists club."
-BILL: Right, exactly.

01:17.375 --> 01:20.917
-And Trump wants to be a member
of that club so badly.
-BILL: Yes, he does.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.834
Okay, Heather, how do you think
MLK would deal with Trump
and the modern Republican party?

01:25.917 --> 01:27.583
(LAUGHTER)

01:27.667 --> 01:30.542
Well, I mean, I think he would
thank the Republican party

01:30.625 --> 01:35.208
for how much love they show him
every single year on one day,
on his birthday.

01:35.291 --> 01:36.583
-(LAUGHTER)
-It's unbelievable.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.875
You know, you had Mike Pence
on the air saying that

01:39.959 --> 01:41.625
what Trump was doing
with the shutdown

01:41.709 --> 01:45.458
and what was in light of,
you know, MLK's values.

01:45.917 --> 01:49.667
I mean, listen,
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King

01:49.750 --> 01:55.834
was a prophet and a leader
and a community organizer all
in one and we need that today.

01:56.208 --> 01:58.917
He showed a vision of what this
country could be,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.291
he brought everybody in,
he wasn't afraid to
educate people,

02:02.375 --> 02:06.125
to talk to recalcitrant white,
you know, pastors and priests

02:06.208 --> 02:10.083
and he wasn't afraid to say
that this country
could be better than it was.

02:10.166 --> 02:13.083
And I don't think
we have enough people
laying out that vision

02:13.166 --> 02:16.500
and, I mean, it's a joke
to pretend the Republican party
right now,

02:16.583 --> 02:22.083
which is just really
remnants of, sort of,
a racist devil's bargain, um,

02:22.542 --> 02:24.667
has any claim
to any part of his vision.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.834
And they do it every single year
on his birthday.

02:26.917 --> 02:28.667
But King said on more than
one occasion that

02:28.750 --> 02:30.917
the bigger problem was
moderate white people.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.375
That's true.

02:33.166 --> 02:35.625
-That's a big theme of his--
-The big problem,
the big impediment to change.

02:35.709 --> 02:37.291
-BILL: Right.
-Right,
'cause that's the problem.

02:37.375 --> 02:38.709
It's not that they didn't
disagree with them,

02:38.792 --> 02:40.041
they just didn't want to
do anything about it.

02:40.417 --> 02:42.750
-Yes. Right. You're rushing,
you're going too fast, yeah.
-HEATHER: Yeah.

02:42.834 --> 02:45.959
Um, by the way, they spent
two minutes at his memorial,

02:46.041 --> 02:49.041
Trump and Pence, they didn't
have anything planned that day

02:49.125 --> 02:50.417
and then they realized
they could lose

02:50.500 --> 02:52.375
their black supporters
if they didn't do something.

02:52.458 --> 02:56.000
-(LAUGHTER)
-And they rushed over there
and spent two minutes.

02:56.417 --> 02:58.625
-MAN: Surprised they didn't--
-Next year they're just gonna
yell out the window.

02:59.125 --> 03:00.083
Yeah.

03:00.417 --> 03:03.166
Uh, okay, Joshua, how would you
describe the relationship

03:03.250 --> 03:05.041
between journalists
like yourself

03:05.125 --> 03:06.959
and sources inside
the White House?

03:07.500 --> 03:10.583
Ah, on the record,
it's terrible,
off the record, it's great.

03:10.834 --> 03:12.667
-I mean, we wouldn't know half--
-(BILL LAUGHS)

03:12.750 --> 03:15.125
We wouldn't know half of what
we know about what goes on

03:15.208 --> 03:18.834
behind the scenes if White House
employees weren't

03:18.917 --> 03:20.583
inveterate leakers,
they all are.

03:20.875 --> 03:23.083
And why do you think that is,
because...

03:23.583 --> 03:28.000
Uh, different reasons, ego,
to stab colleagues in the back,

03:28.083 --> 03:30.125
it's, sort of, Game of Thrones
in there.

03:30.208 --> 03:33.083
Um, you know, some of them just
get a charge out of, you know,

03:33.166 --> 03:34.583
seeing their blind quotes
in print

03:34.667 --> 03:37.792
or trying to, uh,
manipulate Trump,
that's another big reason.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.875
You know, if you get something
on the front page in the

03:39.959 --> 03:42.000
New York Times
Trump will read it

03:42.083 --> 03:44.333
and you can help influence him
that way.

03:44.417 --> 03:48.709
I mean, it's-- It's more true
of television journalists
than it is print like myself,

03:48.792 --> 03:52.792
but Trump's advisers will go
on TV on purpose to talk to him,

03:52.875 --> 03:56.542
because they know that
the likelihood is that Trump is
sitting there with his TV on

03:56.625 --> 03:57.834
listening to what
they have to say.

03:57.917 --> 04:00.166
And there hasn't been
a press conference since--

04:00.250 --> 04:03.500
I mean a press briefing since
December 18th I think--

04:03.583 --> 04:07.542
Not a formal one,
but what's the point?
I mean, they get out--

04:07.625 --> 04:11.583
You know, Sarah Sanders would
get out and lie to journalists,
so there really isn't any value.

04:11.667 --> 04:15.792
So you both sort of agreed,
"Look, if you're just gonna lie,
why do this?"

04:15.875 --> 04:17.792
-JOSHUA: Look--
-Neither side want it.

04:17.875 --> 04:20.834
No, it's our job to show up
and ask tough questions

04:20.917 --> 04:24.000
and document what happens,
create a record of that,
you know,

04:24.083 --> 04:26.166
inform our readers and
our viewers what's happening,

04:26.250 --> 04:28.083
but that can't be the only
line of attack

04:28.166 --> 04:30.250
or the only line of reporting
and it isn't.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.166
I mean, I think to the great
credit of a lot of people,

04:32.250 --> 04:34.750
maybe not so much during
the campaign, but afterwards,

04:34.834 --> 04:36.583
I mean, you've had fantastic
journalism in

04:36.667 --> 04:38.583
the New York Times,
in the Washington Post.

04:38.667 --> 04:42.208
We've done major financial
investigations at Bloomberg
into Trump,

04:42.291 --> 04:47.083
into all the myriad conflicts
of interest that are driving
this administration

04:47.166 --> 04:49.083
and tearing
the country to pieces.

04:49.166 --> 04:51.750
But I want to make sure you
understand how crazy this is.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.583
I worked three years at
the White House
for President Obama,

04:54.667 --> 04:58.834
maybe we were too deliberative,
right, maybe we took too long
to talk about things,

04:58.917 --> 05:00.959
but we used to sit in
the White House situation room

05:01.041 --> 05:03.625
and debate issues and then
come up with a policy

05:03.709 --> 05:07.000
and then, you know, we'd work
up the system and then
the President would sit there,

05:07.083 --> 05:09.000
sometimes for hours,
to talk about it.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.583
None of that happens anymore.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.959
Uh, they rarely meet, uh,
he rarely spends time
with advisers,

05:14.041 --> 05:16.625
he's watching TV
and then on occasion

05:16.709 --> 05:18.792
he'll get on the phone with
a leader and the leader'll say,

05:18.875 --> 05:20.375
"Hey, I think you should leave
Syria."

05:20.458 --> 05:22.709
And he'll say,
"Oh, that's a good idea,
let's leave."

05:22.792 --> 05:25.625
Without any process in place
and we now know this,

05:25.709 --> 05:29.583
because two senior officials
resigned as a result of
the broken process.

05:29.667 --> 05:32.375
That's how da-- From my world
about national security,

05:32.458 --> 05:34.542
it feels really dangerous
that that's the way it works.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.625
He knows more about technology
than anybody.

05:36.709 --> 05:38.250
That's right, I forgot.
I forgot. I forgot.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.959
-I forgot. I forgot.
-(APPLAUSE)

05:40.041 --> 05:41.709
If he know more
about technology--

05:41.792 --> 05:43.875
He literally-- By the way,
can I just say this?

05:43.959 --> 05:47.500
Because people won't believe it,
he doesn't use a computer
and he has--

05:47.583 --> 05:49.917
-(CHUCKLING)
-No, no, he has his aides go
to Drudge Report

05:50.000 --> 05:52.083
and print it out on paper
and bring it to him

05:52.166 --> 05:55.458
in a manila folder, that's how
he reads the internet,
on printed out pieces of paper.

05:55.542 --> 05:56.709
-He knows nothing about
technology.
-(LAUGHTER)

05:56.792 --> 05:57.834
He only reads
when it's his name.

05:57.917 --> 05:59.250
And a piece of paper that we
found out,

05:59.333 --> 06:02.166
he eats paper that he doesn't
want to be saved,

06:02.250 --> 06:05.083
the Presidential Record Act,
he's been eating documents.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.917
He's a lunatic.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.875
-(LAUGHTER)
-BILL: He is.

06:08.959 --> 06:11.959
And the lesson of Trump,
I think, for the future is

06:12.041 --> 06:13.208
if you don't want to get
impeached,

06:13.291 --> 06:15.333
12 impeachable offenses a day
and you're safe.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.917
BILL: Right, yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

06:17.000 --> 06:18.792
Any one thing that this man
has done,

06:18.875 --> 06:20.667
if some other president had done
he'd be out by now.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.250
All this terrific reporting,
everything we've learned,

06:23.333 --> 06:25.291
-somebody else would've been
impeached by now.
-Give it time.

06:25.375 --> 06:27.959
Do 30 impeachable things a day
and you're safe.

06:28.041 --> 06:31.583
Uh, Ambassador, how closely is
social media monitored

06:31.667 --> 06:35.875
in Russia and do you think Putin
will attempt to crack down on
those platforms?

06:35.959 --> 06:36.959
Do they have...

06:37.041 --> 06:38.792
Everything is monitored,
of course.

06:38.875 --> 06:39.875
Uh, right now--

06:40.750 --> 06:42.750
-BILL: But it's not like China
where they totally stop it?
-But they don't cut it off.

06:42.834 --> 06:46.250
And so far, Putin's allowed
that as kind of a safety valve

06:46.333 --> 06:48.792
for the liberals,
for the pro-Western forces

06:48.875 --> 06:50.625
to kinda tweet among themselves.

06:50.792 --> 06:53.583
Uh, the lower his approval
ratings get, I think,

06:53.667 --> 06:55.917
the more likelihood that they'll
go after those platforms.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.625
And they'll--
They like the Chinese model.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.000
They'll eventually end up
like China.

06:59.500 --> 07:03.500
They're still really
struggling with what happened
under communism, aren't they?

07:03.792 --> 07:07.125
I mean, communism made them
so cynical. Ronald Reagan,

07:07.208 --> 07:10.041
not my favorite,
but when he said
it was an evil empire,

07:10.125 --> 07:11.834
-dead on, I think.
-Yeah, I agree.

07:11.917 --> 07:16.542
There's nothing more corrosive
to the soul than living under
a communist regime.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.375
And what Putin has promised them
is, "I'm gonna make us
a great power again."

07:20.458 --> 07:22.333
-Right.
-"I'm not gonna, you know,
you're gonna be poor

07:22.417 --> 07:24.834
or you're not gonna have goods,
you know, that's the trade,

07:24.917 --> 07:28.208
but you're gonna feel great
again like you did
during the Soviet era."

07:28.291 --> 07:29.458
That's the trade
he's given them.

07:29.542 --> 07:31.458
-HEATHER: Sounds familiar.
-(LAUGHTER)

07:31.542 --> 07:33.083
Let's feel great again in the
green room.

07:33.166 --> 07:34.625
Thank you, everybody,
I appreciate it.

07:34.709 --> 07:37.333
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
-Thank you.
