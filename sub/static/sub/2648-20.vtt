WEBVTT

00:04.288 --> 00:05.588
Want some coffee?

00:05.623 --> 00:07.756
Say yes.
It's French press.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.191
I was doubtful, too,

00:09.224 --> 00:11.491
but I honestly can't see myself
going back to drip.

00:11.526 --> 00:14.294
I'm so happy you don't live
in a tough neighborhood anymore.

00:14.327 --> 00:16.227
We're so sorry for just
dropping by like this.

00:16.262 --> 00:17.830
Are you kidding me?

00:17.864 --> 00:21.898
I'll take any chance to spend
time with this little princess.

00:21.932 --> 00:24.934
I love her little hair,
her little toes.

00:24.967 --> 00:26.268
And she loves her grandmother.

00:26.302 --> 00:28.335
I don't love
"grandmother."

00:28.370 --> 00:30.604
So, Cam and I have been
revising our will

00:30.639 --> 00:32.604
to specify who should
take care of Lily

00:32.640 --> 00:34.639
if, God forbid,
something happened to us.

00:34.673 --> 00:35.840
God forbid.

00:35.874 --> 00:37.741
I said "God for..."

00:37.775 --> 00:39.709
So, we've been
dropping by unannounced

00:39.743 --> 00:41.977
to, you know,
casually assess our candidates.

00:42.011 --> 00:43.478
Not all of our candidates.

00:43.513 --> 00:45.546
No, t... that's true.
We did not drop by Missour-ah.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.780
It's "Missouri." No one from
Missouri would say "Missour-ah."

00:47.814 --> 00:49.916
I'm so sorr-ah.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.184
So, anyway, Claire and Phil
were our first thought,

00:53.218 --> 00:54.952
so we dropped by their place
last week.

00:56.121 --> 00:58.221
You win the award
for worst mother ever!

00:58.255 --> 01:00.622
I will be sure to thank you
in my speech!

01:00.656 --> 01:02.923
Phil, the frying pan's on fire!

01:02.957 --> 01:05.959
Son of Jor-El!
Everybody stay calm!

01:05.992 --> 01:07.993
Dad, I'm gonna teach myself
how to juggle.

01:08.028 --> 01:09.628
Good for you, buddy.

01:09.696 --> 01:11.963
- Mom!
- No one heard me screaming?!

01:11.996 --> 01:14.248
I've been trapped in the garage
for like 20 minutes!

01:14.297 --> 01:16.565
And yet still you didn't get
the rat traps I sent you for.

01:16.599 --> 01:17.565
- Oh!
- Thank you.

01:17.601 --> 01:19.134
Honey, it's doing it again!

01:19.167 --> 01:20.835
Come on, now!
Every morning?!

01:20.869 --> 01:23.069
I hope the whole house burns down!

01:23.103 --> 01:24.604
Did we come at a bad time?

01:24.638 --> 01:26.471
Come back in seven years
and five months,

01:26.507 --> 01:27.571
when they're all gone!

01:36.646 --> 01:39.597

01:39.647 --> 01:42.014
So, mama, you're good for coal?!

01:42.050 --> 01:43.316
Okay, okay!

01:43.350 --> 01:46.216
Well, you bundle up!
We don't want to lose you!

01:46.251 --> 01:48.184
Okay. Yeah, bye!

01:48.218 --> 01:49.953
They're in the middle
of a terrible blizzard.

01:49.988 --> 01:51.187
So you shouted!

01:51.220 --> 01:52.987
Did they really lose two cows?

01:53.021 --> 01:54.990
Oh, yeah, frozen solid.
Mama's gonna send pictures.

01:55.023 --> 01:56.691
Oh, yay, a reason to stop
by the frame store.

01:56.724 --> 01:58.991
Manny, I got to get you down
to that sporting-goods place.

01:59.025 --> 02:01.427
- Got to get him some stuff
for his weekend outing. - Ready!

02:01.460 --> 02:03.527
- Did you pee?
- Not ready.

02:03.562 --> 02:05.363
- Jay, would you mind if we came?
- Sure, why not?

02:05.396 --> 02:06.963
You know, I'd like to get mama
some snowshoes...

02:06.997 --> 02:09.465
You know, to lift her spirits,
what with all the frozen cows and all.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.099
So, cows freeze now?
Are we all just accepting that?

02:12.133 --> 02:13.467
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Jay, this one time...

02:13.502 --> 02:15.302
We'll take two cars.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.602
If you want, I can stay
with the little princess.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.037
Oh, that... that's a great idea.

02:19.071 --> 02:20.939
Oh, yeah, I'll just... I'll just
go out and get her bag.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.706
Maybe I can take her
to the mall,

02:22.741 --> 02:24.507
buy her a new outfit,

02:24.542 --> 02:26.842
get her some hair rings...
Is that okay?

02:26.877 --> 02:28.477
Yes, yes, of course.

02:28.510 --> 02:30.644
Um, you know, Gloria,
Cam and I were talking

02:30.679 --> 02:32.478
about what would happen to Lily

02:32.512 --> 02:34.280
if anything were ever
to happen to us,

02:34.314 --> 02:36.481
- and we were thinking...
- Oh, my God. Ąsí, sí, sí! I take her!

02:36.516 --> 02:37.982
Okay, well, that's very sweet,

02:38.016 --> 02:39.183
but you realize
it would only happen...

02:39.218 --> 02:40.484
I can't wait!

02:40.518 --> 02:41.617
Okay, well, hopefully,
it's a long shot.

02:41.652 --> 02:43.720
Ay, a little girl!

02:43.753 --> 02:45.988
There would have to be
a very tragic accident.

02:46.022 --> 02:48.655
I know, I know.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.090
Nothing is going to happen.

02:50.125 --> 02:52.325
Oh.

02:52.360 --> 02:56.661
But if it did,
we would be so happy!

02:56.694 --> 02:59.128
ĄAy!

02:59.162 --> 03:01.864
So, what do you say, pal?
I got to swing by the office.

03:01.898 --> 03:03.298
You want to come along?

03:03.333 --> 03:04.631
Can't.
We got some stuff to do.

03:04.666 --> 03:06.533
- What?
- Just errands.

03:06.568 --> 03:07.735
Oh.

03:07.768 --> 03:10.235
I'm taking Luke to see
a child psychologist.

03:10.270 --> 03:13.038
This is something
that Phil would never agree to.

03:13.072 --> 03:15.573
He's doesn't want Luke
to feel... different.

03:15.607 --> 03:17.239
But Luke's grades aren't great,

03:17.274 --> 03:19.674
and he's having trouble
concentrating in school.

03:19.708 --> 03:23.643
I just want to make sure
that he's... normal.

03:23.678 --> 03:26.246
- Hey, mom, check it out.
- What are you doing?

03:26.279 --> 03:27.979
If I move my head fast enough,

03:28.014 --> 03:30.148
it looks like the can
is standing still.

03:30.181 --> 03:33.083
'Cause sometimes I wonder.

03:33.118 --> 03:35.185
But all the girls at work
love it when I bring Luke by,

03:35.219 --> 03:37.386
especially that receptionist
Heather, right, buddy?

03:37.421 --> 03:39.154
She smells amazing.

03:39.188 --> 03:41.654
Mm. Well, honey, you're gonna have to smell
daddy's receptionist some other time.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.057
Like peaches.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.358
If you're both going out,
who's taking me to cello?

03:45.393 --> 03:47.358
- One time, she gave me a Woody.
- Sweet Je...

03:47.394 --> 03:49.594
She remembered he's my favorite
character from "Toy Story."

03:49.627 --> 03:50.862
She did.

03:50.895 --> 03:53.762
Uh... Haley, how are you
getting to the mall?

03:53.797 --> 03:55.765
Uh, Gabby's picking me up.

03:55.798 --> 03:57.832
Okay, you're gonna drop your sister
off at her cello lesson first.

03:57.866 --> 04:00.401
No way. She plays lacrosse
and takes cello lessons.

04:00.435 --> 04:02.769
Even my reputation
can't handle that dork hit.

04:02.803 --> 04:06.171
Okay, well, then you don't need to go
snowboarding with your friends on break.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.039
Fine, I'll take her.

04:08.072 --> 04:09.571
Just never look
my friends in the eye,

04:09.606 --> 04:11.074
and only speak in emergencies.

04:11.107 --> 04:13.408
Got it.
Ah! Already failed.

04:15.244 --> 04:17.743
Honey, after I go by the office,
maybe we can grab some lunch.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.911
Oh, I can't. I got to pick up
all that stuff for the school trip.

04:19.946 --> 04:22.047
But you know what?
I'll see you tonight at dad and Gloria's.

04:22.081 --> 04:23.714
- Okay.
- Smell Heather for me.

04:23.748 --> 04:25.848
I always do... not.

04:30.552 --> 04:32.086
Ms. Dunphy?

04:32.120 --> 04:33.888
Hi, Dr. Klausner.
I am so sorry we're late.

04:33.922 --> 04:35.588
We just got a little bit
caught up in...

04:35.623 --> 04:36.822
Oh, no, it's okay.
It's okay.

04:36.856 --> 04:38.924
It gave me a chance
to chat with your husband.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.559
Hello, Claire.

04:40.593 --> 04:41.993
So, Luke, come on in with me.

04:42.027 --> 04:44.194
Mom and dad, we'll let you know
when we need you.

04:44.228 --> 04:46.695
Go get 'em, pal.

04:46.729 --> 04:49.764
- How did you...
- How did I what?

04:49.798 --> 04:52.131
Know you were someplace
you left no trace of

04:52.167 --> 04:53.967
except for a tiny notation
in your calendar?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.001
It was quite simple, really.

04:56.036 --> 04:57.518
I noticed a tiny nota...

04:57.569 --> 04:58.869
Shoot.

05:03.793 --> 05:06.391
That's weird.
My cello teacher's car's in here.

05:06.409 --> 05:07.741
I wonder if she's not home.

05:07.776 --> 05:09.775
Okay, so go knock on the door,
Alan Einstein.

05:09.811 --> 05:11.811
Don't leave.
And it's "Albert."

05:11.845 --> 05:14.412
I know. Alan's his dorky brother
who played the cello.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.413
Good one.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.883
I should probably not be
telling you this.

05:19.917 --> 05:21.716
- What?
- Nothing. It's really bad.

05:21.752 --> 05:22.917
Tell me.

05:22.951 --> 05:24.518
When you and Dylan
were broken up,

05:24.554 --> 05:26.887
Rachel told him you were a skank
and got all up on him.

05:26.921 --> 05:29.321
No!
But she's so nice to me.

05:29.355 --> 05:31.390
To your face.
That's how she plays.

05:31.424 --> 05:33.457
Well, now she's gonna see
how we play.

05:33.492 --> 05:34.858
What are we gonna do?

05:34.893 --> 05:36.792
She's not there. You're just
gonna have to take me home.

05:36.828 --> 05:39.361
We don't have time.
We have stuff to do.

05:39.396 --> 05:40.962
Then I'm just gonna
have to come with you.

05:40.997 --> 05:42.763
Can't we just drop her off
at a coffee shop or something?

05:42.797 --> 05:44.998
What, so she gets kidnapped
and I get in trouble?

05:45.032 --> 05:46.731
No, thank you.

05:46.766 --> 05:48.067
Okay, fine,
you can come with us,

05:48.101 --> 05:50.301
but you have to keep your mouth
shut about anything you see.

05:50.335 --> 05:52.937
- What's she gonna see?
- Just drive!

05:52.971 --> 05:55.472
Ooh, maybe I should also get
a gift for my aunt Pat.

05:55.506 --> 05:57.139
Have I ever told you about her?

05:57.173 --> 05:59.706
Total gun nut, lives
completely off the grid.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.408
Did you see how cute
Gloria was with Lily?

06:01.442 --> 06:02.642
Oh, Pat is hilarious.

06:02.676 --> 06:04.344
I don't think she's paid taxes
in 20 years,

06:04.378 --> 06:05.377
but very hospitable.

06:05.411 --> 06:06.545
Always has a deer
in the freezer.

06:06.579 --> 06:07.845
Would you listen to me?

06:07.879 --> 06:10.447
I think that Gloria and my dad
could be Lily's guardians.

06:10.481 --> 06:13.215
Look, you know I love Jay,
and they're still in the mix,

06:13.249 --> 06:15.616
but I just don't know
about him raising a child.

06:15.650 --> 06:17.818
Well, Cam, he raised me.

06:17.854 --> 06:21.787
Well, now you've put me
in an awkward position.

06:21.821 --> 06:25.858
Oh, look at that.
That's adorable.

06:25.891 --> 06:27.424
Let's see if we can get you
some snow pants.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.858
I just wish I felt better.

06:28.892 --> 06:30.560
I think I'm coming down
with flu-like symptoms.

06:30.594 --> 06:32.228
Couple of hours before
your camping trip, huh?

06:32.261 --> 06:33.496
I want to go.

06:33.530 --> 06:35.630
It's just, if I'm sick,
I might get the chaperones sick,

06:35.664 --> 06:37.464
and without chaperones,
it's anarchy.

06:37.499 --> 06:39.532
- Manny, listen to me.
- The buddy system falls apart,

06:39.599 --> 06:41.933
the principle of "last in,
first out" is ignored.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.734
- It's butterflies.
- Where?

06:43.769 --> 06:46.569
You're just nervous because there's
gonna be a lot of physical activity,

06:46.605 --> 06:48.270
which is not exactly
your strong suit.

06:48.304 --> 06:50.689
It is a little daunting
out there.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.472
D... don't use the word "daunting"
in nature, okay?

06:52.508 --> 06:54.508
You just need
a little self-confidence.

06:54.542 --> 06:56.942
Look at this. They got one
of these rock walls here.

06:56.978 --> 06:58.210
Why don't you hop up on that?

06:58.244 --> 06:59.244
Why?

06:59.278 --> 07:01.145
Why? To prove
that you can do it.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.614
If you can do that,
you can do anything.

07:03.648 --> 07:06.047
Really? Can I fly?
Can I speak Chinese?

07:06.082 --> 07:08.216
No, but you can sleep
in the house tonight.

07:08.250 --> 07:11.684
Ace? Want to wire my boy up, here?
Go ahead.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.418
I'm sorry I went
behind your back.

07:13.454 --> 07:16.722
But you get so defensive whenever
we talk about Luke's issues.

07:16.756 --> 07:19.423
He doesn't have issues.
You're just a worrier.

07:19.457 --> 07:21.257
Like when you thought
he was never gonna talk.

07:21.291 --> 07:23.593
He was 2,
and all he could do was bark!

07:23.627 --> 07:25.861
- I understood him.
- Phil!

07:25.895 --> 07:27.762
Look, he starts coming here,

07:27.796 --> 07:30.530
the other kids find out,
he becomes a target,

07:30.564 --> 07:32.431
like that limping gazelle
at the watering hole

07:32.466 --> 07:33.899
that the alligator knows to eat.

07:33.933 --> 07:35.400
They're crocodiles,
not alligators.

07:35.434 --> 07:36.668
There are no alligators
in Africa.

07:36.701 --> 07:39.769
How about at the zoo?
Bam! Who needs a shrink now?

07:39.803 --> 07:41.336
- Mr. and Mrs. Dunphy?
- Yes?

07:41.372 --> 07:42.871
Hi.

07:42.905 --> 07:44.772
Luke, I'm gonna talk to your
mom and dad for a minute, okay?

07:44.805 --> 07:46.740
Okay. She's, like,
the best doctor ever.

07:46.774 --> 07:49.441
A couple of puzzles, no shots.

07:49.477 --> 07:51.577
I didn't even have
to take my pants off.

07:51.611 --> 07:53.577
Found that one out
a little late.

07:53.612 --> 07:56.246
I've been there, buddy.

07:56.347 --> 07:57.330
Mwah!

08:01.016 --> 08:02.783
Well, Luke's a terrific kid.

08:02.818 --> 08:04.217
I have a few thoughts,
but, honestly,

08:04.252 --> 08:05.852
I don't see anything
that's cause for alarm.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.853
Awesome.
Thanks so much for your time.

08:07.954 --> 08:09.587
We... we would love
to hear your thoughts.

08:09.655 --> 08:14.090
Well... he's a bright
and curious boy,

08:14.124 --> 08:15.592
but he gets distracted.

08:15.659 --> 08:16.741
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

08:16.793 --> 08:18.893
I see it all the time
with above-average kids.

08:18.927 --> 08:21.362
Mm-hmm. Phil, honey,
I want you to hear this.

08:21.396 --> 08:22.863
Mm-hmm.

08:22.897 --> 08:24.362
They're a little overstimulated

08:24.398 --> 08:26.765
because there are so many things
they're interested in.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.667
They never seem to focus.

08:28.700 --> 08:29.800
Makes me crazy.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.235
Too crazy.

08:31.269 --> 08:32.568
Well, they usually
do outgrow it.

08:32.602 --> 08:34.802
- What if they don't?
- He will.

08:34.836 --> 08:36.604
Well, there's...
there's medication,

08:36.638 --> 08:39.371
but why don't we cross
that bridge if we come to it?

08:39.407 --> 08:42.441
Is there any way to avoid
that bridge altogether?

08:42.475 --> 08:44.909
You know,
maybe there's diet or...

08:44.945 --> 08:47.412
or focusing exercises
or something?

08:47.446 --> 08:49.112
Mrs. Dunphy, what exactly
are you worried about?

08:49.147 --> 08:50.378
Get comfortable.

08:50.414 --> 08:53.314
I'm worried he's turning
into you, Phil.

08:53.348 --> 08:55.283
I knew
the minute I opened my mouth

08:55.318 --> 08:56.951
that I was in the wrong,

08:56.985 --> 09:00.018
but, honestly, sometimes
I wonder about him.

09:00.053 --> 09:02.153
- Hey, mom, check it out.
- What are you doing?

09:02.188 --> 09:03.721
If I move my head fast enough,

09:03.755 --> 09:06.121
it looks like the can
is standing still.

09:06.189 --> 09:10.426
He's totally right!

09:10.460 --> 09:13.261
I just find it interesting
that you blame Jay

09:13.295 --> 09:14.962
for everything
from your night terrors

09:14.996 --> 09:16.262
to your shy bladder,

09:16.296 --> 09:18.231
and now he's
the perfect guardian for Lily.

09:18.265 --> 09:21.566
No, not perfect, and... and I never
said anything about my shy bladder.

09:21.601 --> 09:24.201
O... oh. Then why did I have to
stand guard outside the bathroom

09:24.235 --> 09:26.636
at Pepper's three faces
of new year's Eve party?

09:26.670 --> 09:27.803
Damn it, Manny!
Move it! Go!

09:27.837 --> 09:28.936
It's scary.

09:28.972 --> 09:31.038
You're 2 feet off the ground.

09:31.073 --> 09:32.905
I've seen vines climb walls
faster than that.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.374
Move your butt!

09:34.408 --> 09:37.076
Oh, well, there's your
esteem-building parent right there.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.009
Wait, wait,
I think I hear future Lily

09:39.043 --> 09:41.277
sending us a message
from her stripper pole...

09:41.311 --> 09:44.079
"Thanks, gay dead dads.
This dance is for you."

09:44.113 --> 09:45.414
Excuse me, Jay?

09:45.447 --> 09:46.615
I'm getting down.

09:46.649 --> 09:48.382
Not till you touch the top!
What is it?

09:48.416 --> 09:50.782
Well, maybe if we didn't bully Manny
so much, but, rather, showed him,

09:50.817 --> 09:52.252
he wouldn't be so afraid.

09:52.286 --> 09:55.721
Excuse me, sherpa, can you
assist me with the harness?

09:55.755 --> 09:59.589
Oh, no. Which one
of these is my driving machine?

09:59.624 --> 10:02.657
Phil, I already apologized.
It just... it came out wrong.

10:02.691 --> 10:04.208
Funny, I thought
that was my problem...

10:04.259 --> 10:05.826
I came out wrong.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.660
Hold on.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.730
Oh, good, I can walk again.

10:10.764 --> 10:12.496
Honey, you know, sometimes
you can act a little bit...

10:12.530 --> 10:13.664
Oh, no!
Where did everyone go?!

10:13.698 --> 10:15.999
Oh, just a blink.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.001
Phil, when you are ready
to talk to me like an adult,

10:18.035 --> 10:19.167
why don't you let me know?

10:19.203 --> 10:22.103
Fine.
Okay, okay.

10:22.137 --> 10:23.537
The adults are
the big ones, right?

10:36.279 --> 10:39.781
Hey, how do you think
that got up there?

10:39.815 --> 10:42.349
Uh-oh.

10:42.383 --> 10:46.150
Now, I know it seems daunting,
Manny, but it's very simple.

10:46.184 --> 10:47.986
I'm securely hitched to a rope,

10:48.020 --> 10:49.986
which means
I'm not going to fall.

10:49.989 --> 10:52.087
You know, dad, you're really
making my life difficult right now.

10:52.123 --> 10:53.590
How?

10:53.624 --> 10:55.156
By barking at Manny
like a drill sergeant

10:55.190 --> 10:56.391
when I'm trying to convince Cam

10:56.425 --> 10:57.925
that you'd be
a great guardian for Lily.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.259
- Guardian?
- Yeah.

10:59.294 --> 11:01.093
- You're kidding.
- Aah!

11:01.129 --> 11:02.327
Jay!

11:02.361 --> 11:03.361
Yeah, never mind.

11:03.397 --> 11:04.595
That really hurt!

11:08.487 --> 11:09.406
This is a mistake.

11:09.411 --> 11:11.101
Why does she keep saying that?

11:11.102 --> 11:13.669
Because they're the first words
she ever heard.

11:13.702 --> 11:14.702
Here, you go first.

11:14.735 --> 11:16.803
This will teach
that skank a lesson.

11:16.871 --> 11:18.772
Shaving cream in her locker?

11:18.806 --> 11:20.356
Just stand over there
and yell if someone's coming.

11:20.406 --> 11:21.873
She might have
homework assignments in there

11:21.974 --> 11:23.473
she hasn't handed in yet.

11:23.509 --> 11:24.675
Haley!

11:26.678 --> 11:28.259
- Someone's coming!
- Run!

11:31.580 --> 11:33.847
- This way, this way!
- Okay, okay, okay!

11:33.882 --> 11:36.381
- Where are we?
- Boys' locker room.

11:36.416 --> 11:37.583
It smells like feet.

11:37.584 --> 11:38.984
- That's not feet.
- Okay.

11:43.021 --> 11:44.119
I'm so scared.

11:44.122 --> 11:45.754
Just go to your happy place.

11:45.790 --> 11:47.689
We just broke
into my happy place.

11:47.690 --> 11:48.656
Who's there?

11:55.895 --> 11:57.027
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

11:57.062 --> 11:59.330
Go, go, run, run!

11:59.333 --> 12:02.164
Not so loud! Run! Run!

12:02.198 --> 12:04.067
So, how you doing?

12:04.101 --> 12:07.567
Oh, not good. I'm just glad my clown training
prepared me to take a fall like that.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.570
Yeah, and in terms
of talking about it,

12:09.587 --> 12:11.286
are we looking at weeks, months?

12:11.339 --> 12:14.405
Do not minimize it, you, who I had
to rush to the emergency room

12:14.440 --> 12:16.039
that time you fell
out of your clogs.

12:16.042 --> 12:17.974
There's your bubbly water
with lemon.

12:18.009 --> 12:19.375
Thank you, Jay.

12:19.409 --> 12:20.542
How you doin'?

12:20.576 --> 12:21.811
Oh, it's hard to tell.

12:21.845 --> 12:23.044
You know, anytime you have

12:23.079 --> 12:25.079
a catastrophic injury
to your lumbar area...

12:25.113 --> 12:27.481
I could use a little piece
of lumbar myself right now.

12:27.515 --> 12:30.183
Well, I hope
you're comfortable now

12:30.217 --> 12:32.717
making my family
Lily's guardians.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.551
ĄHola, hola!

12:34.585 --> 12:36.218
You're forgetting about Gloria.

12:36.252 --> 12:38.220
Even you have to admit
how amazing she is with Lily.

12:38.254 --> 12:41.055
Mm!
Look who's so pretty!

12:41.124 --> 12:42.823
Oh, my God!

12:42.857 --> 12:44.191
Gloria, what did you do?

12:44.225 --> 12:45.325
What I told you.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.526
You pierced her ears?!

12:46.561 --> 12:48.227
What I said...

12:48.261 --> 12:50.694
I was going to make her
pretty with earrings.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.730
I thought you said
"hair rings."

12:52.764 --> 12:54.231
What are hair rings?

12:54.265 --> 12:55.530
Yes, Mitchell,
what are hair rings?

12:55.566 --> 12:57.465
Something that you would
tie your hair back...

12:57.467 --> 12:58.999
She said it!

12:59.034 --> 13:00.818
I didn't say "hair rings."
I said "earrings."

13:00.868 --> 13:02.268
You don't like?

13:02.304 --> 13:04.170
Of course not.
You punctured our daughter! Oh!

13:04.204 --> 13:07.523
But did you see both sides?
I didn't just do the gay ear.

13:07.573 --> 13:08.773
Look.

13:08.840 --> 13:09.941
Oh, my God.

13:09.975 --> 13:11.608
Oh, my God.

13:16.045 --> 13:20.447
I actually...
I think we're good.

13:20.481 --> 13:22.615
Let's just wait in here
for Gabby, okay?

13:22.649 --> 13:24.950
Oh, my God! I can't believe
we just did that.

13:24.984 --> 13:26.783
Can you believe
we just did that?

13:26.818 --> 13:28.918
Yeah, we had a lot of fun.
Let's not geek it up.

13:28.953 --> 13:31.953
Wait. What if I have
a taste for it now?

13:31.987 --> 13:33.888
Am I gonna start doing stuff
like that all the time?

13:33.922 --> 13:36.124
Calm down.
You just did one bad thing.

13:38.493 --> 13:41.393
Two.

13:41.428 --> 13:43.594
I skipped my cello lesson today.

13:43.629 --> 13:46.263
That wasn't even
where my teacher lives.

13:46.297 --> 13:47.897
You ditched a class?

13:47.931 --> 13:49.931
Well, I... I didn't
have time to practice

13:49.965 --> 13:52.166
because of lacrosse
and debate team and...

13:52.168 --> 13:53.800
Do you even like
playing the cello?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.735
Yeah.

13:55.770 --> 13:56.703
Alex?

13:57.904 --> 14:00.204
I hate it.

14:00.272 --> 14:01.938
So quit.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.706
I've never quit anything.

14:03.740 --> 14:05.840
You've never broke
into a school before.

14:05.876 --> 14:08.010
Just did that.

14:08.043 --> 14:10.711
No offense, but the family's
hopes and dreams

14:10.745 --> 14:12.111
are kind of pinned on me.

14:12.147 --> 14:15.313
I'm just saying
that no one would blame you

14:15.349 --> 14:17.549
if you stopped
being so perfect.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.785
It actually would take
a lot of pressure off of me.

14:23.754 --> 14:25.553
I did something bad, too...

14:25.587 --> 14:27.555
Something that nobody knows.

14:27.589 --> 14:29.656
- What?
- Come here.

14:29.690 --> 14:31.756
I can't say it too loud, okay?

14:31.791 --> 14:33.224
What did you do?

14:37.528 --> 14:42.430
Phil, I'm just not sure
you understand

14:42.433 --> 14:44.565
why I said what I said.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.699
There are qualities about me
you wish you could change,

14:46.801 --> 14:48.500
but you can't
'cause I'm all grown up,

14:48.535 --> 14:50.002
but it's not too late for Luke.

14:50.036 --> 14:51.903
Okay.

14:52.004 --> 14:54.806
Honey, there are
a hundred things about Luke

14:54.839 --> 14:57.707
that he gets from you
that I absolutely love.

14:57.742 --> 14:59.674
It's just this...
this one tiny part

14:59.708 --> 15:02.510
that I'm sure if I could just
get in there and just... ee!

15:02.544 --> 15:04.945
Claire... he's a great kid.

15:04.979 --> 15:06.579
He's gonna be fine.

15:06.613 --> 15:08.713
I know.

15:08.747 --> 15:10.415
I think I know.

15:10.449 --> 15:13.750
I feel terrible that we fought
in front of him.

15:13.783 --> 15:15.652
Did he say anything about that
on the drive here?

15:15.686 --> 15:17.485
How would I know?
He rode with you.

15:17.504 --> 15:19.554
He didn't drive with me.
He drove with you.

15:23.223 --> 15:27.509
Just admit it... you want Lily
raised by anyone but my family.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.526
It's just so far away
from everything she knows.

15:29.561 --> 15:32.060
And then there's the crazy aunts
and the frozen cows.

15:32.094 --> 15:33.528
Oh, please, in the last hour,

15:33.564 --> 15:36.198
your father publicly shamed Manny,
dropped me from the sky,

15:36.232 --> 15:38.399
while his wife drilled holes
in our baby's head.

15:38.433 --> 15:39.766
Oh!

15:39.800 --> 15:42.201
Which is why I think we should
revisit Claire and Phil.

15:42.235 --> 15:43.502
Where are my keys?

15:43.536 --> 15:46.170
We left Luke alone
in a parking garage!

15:46.171 --> 15:48.637
We don't know the whole story.

15:48.673 --> 15:49.805
Don't we?

15:49.841 --> 15:51.122
- Whose car are we taking?
- Mine.

15:51.173 --> 15:52.774
Then I'm driving!

15:52.808 --> 15:55.342
Hey, mom.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.976
- Buddy!
- Luke?

15:57.011 --> 15:58.277
- Buddy!
- Lukey?

15:58.280 --> 15:59.945
- Thank you so much.
- Honey, get out of there.

15:59.979 --> 16:01.145
Thank you!

16:01.179 --> 16:02.280
I'm so sorry.
We are so sorry.

16:02.347 --> 16:03.813
Oh, buddy,
you must've been so scared.

16:03.848 --> 16:05.249
- No. - Oh, God.
- Well, what happened?

16:05.350 --> 16:06.483
Well, I knew you'd come back.

16:06.550 --> 16:07.484
Uh-huh.

16:07.518 --> 16:08.551
Then you didn't.

16:08.586 --> 16:10.786
So I had to go find a phone.

16:10.820 --> 16:13.220
That's when I saw a stray dog
and I played with him for a while.

16:13.237 --> 16:14.221
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

16:14.237 --> 16:15.655
Then I thought I saw
Mrs. Morgan,

16:15.689 --> 16:17.856
my first-grade teacher,
going into a church.

16:17.890 --> 16:20.557
It wasn't her,
but there was a wedding there.

16:20.592 --> 16:21.893
That's where I met the Litvaks.

16:21.927 --> 16:23.893
Oh, thank you!
Thank you so much.

16:23.927 --> 16:25.261
Congratul... tov.

16:26.796 --> 16:28.230
Mwah! Oh, baby.

16:28.264 --> 16:29.764
- Can I go get a drink?
- Yes, you can.

16:29.799 --> 16:31.565
- Yes, you can! You can drink
whatever you want! - Of course you can.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.133
There's tons of soda in there.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.300
Ohh!

16:36.368 --> 16:38.669
What an amazing kid!

16:38.703 --> 16:41.770
I can't believe I ever worried
about him out in the world.

16:43.005 --> 16:45.039
That's what I do, though, isn't it?
I worry.

16:45.075 --> 16:46.807
I worry... I think about
a tiny, little thing,

16:46.841 --> 16:48.407
and then I obsess on it,
until, suddenly,

16:48.443 --> 16:49.910
it's the only thing
I can think about.

16:49.944 --> 16:52.078
God, please don't let me
screw up our son.

16:52.161 --> 16:53.845
Hey, hey.

16:55.881 --> 16:57.882
You know why else
he's gonna be okay?

16:57.916 --> 16:59.215
No.

16:59.249 --> 17:02.818
Because somewhere out there
is a worried little girl

17:02.852 --> 17:05.519
who's making lists
and labeling bins,

17:05.586 --> 17:08.588
and he's gonna find her.

17:12.022 --> 17:14.074
Mm!

17:14.126 --> 17:15.358
Oh!

17:15.393 --> 17:16.925
Cam?

17:16.961 --> 17:19.694
I know you're kind of down
on Jay being Lily's guardian.

17:19.729 --> 17:22.195
Now, that's not anything
you need to worry about, Manny.

17:22.231 --> 17:24.480
I just think you're being
too hard on him.

17:24.532 --> 17:26.365
We had a little chat in the car.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.333
I'm sorry I let you down, Jay.

17:28.367 --> 17:31.067
I'm starting to think if
I couldn't even get up that wall,

17:31.102 --> 17:32.869
then why am I even
going on this...

17:32.904 --> 17:34.070
Knock it off, Manny.

17:34.104 --> 17:35.905
We both know you could
get up that wall.

17:35.938 --> 17:37.840
Now, why are you trying
to get out of this trip?

17:37.874 --> 17:39.506
I'm not.
I'm excited to go...

17:39.541 --> 17:41.340
Manny...

17:41.376 --> 17:42.576
Okay.

17:42.609 --> 17:45.010
I have some concerns
about the shower situation.

17:45.045 --> 17:47.011
Oh. Because?

17:47.046 --> 17:49.412
- Well, I'm pretty much at my target weight.
- That's good.

17:49.447 --> 17:54.115
But the thing is, I haven't
quite reached my target height.

17:54.150 --> 17:56.285
Got it.

17:56.318 --> 17:58.018
All right, first of all,
you don't have to go.

17:58.053 --> 18:00.020
I'll write you a note.

18:00.053 --> 18:01.853
We'll plan on doing
something fun this weekend.

18:01.888 --> 18:03.054
- Really?
- You bet.

18:03.089 --> 18:05.022
And you're not mad at me?

18:05.057 --> 18:07.491
Look, if you were a different kid,
I'd give you the speech...

18:07.524 --> 18:09.126
You know,
"we all have insecurities.

18:09.159 --> 18:10.526
You've got to
be brave here."

18:10.560 --> 18:11.827
But let's face it...

18:11.862 --> 18:13.528
you're already
about the bravest kid I know.

18:13.563 --> 18:15.278
- I am?
- Come on.

18:15.329 --> 18:18.597
You wear blazers to school.
You play the pan flute.

18:18.632 --> 18:20.865
You... you read poetry to girls.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.266
I couldn't even talk to girls
when I was your age.

18:23.302 --> 18:26.101
The shower thing's nothing
compared to all that.

18:26.137 --> 18:29.905
So, whatever you decide,
I'm behind you.

18:32.206 --> 18:34.374
No, I got that set up
just right.

18:34.408 --> 18:36.442
I told you about that before.

18:36.476 --> 18:38.277
Jay said that?

18:38.311 --> 18:40.377
Yeah, and he wasn't drinking
or anything.

18:40.412 --> 18:41.745
So, what are you gonna do?

18:41.779 --> 18:43.514
I think I'm gonna go.

18:43.547 --> 18:46.149
I mean, if Reuben can go
with that extra nipple...

18:46.182 --> 18:48.583
I'm proud of you, Manny.

18:48.618 --> 18:51.751
You're doing the right thing,
trust me.

18:51.785 --> 18:53.753
I mean, what were
you thinking, Gloria?

18:53.788 --> 18:56.120
Ay, Mitch, I said I was sorry.

18:56.156 --> 19:00.190
But I had them since I was 2...
huge ones.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.325
What is she...

19:01.358 --> 19:03.224
Earrings, Phil.
Earrings.

19:03.259 --> 19:06.494
Mitch, I just wanted to tell you
how really touched I was

19:06.528 --> 19:08.728
you'd want me to be
Lily's guardian.

19:08.763 --> 19:11.698
Oh, you're welcome.
And you're out.

19:11.731 --> 19:13.130
Excuse me.

19:13.166 --> 19:15.498
I have a very important
announcement to make.

19:17.569 --> 19:20.668
Oh. Sorry.
Sorry, so rude.

19:20.704 --> 19:23.870
Totally inexcusable.
Yello!

19:28.874 --> 19:32.410
Mitchell and I have decided
that if, God forbid,

19:32.444 --> 19:33.744
anything should happen to us...

19:33.777 --> 19:35.179
- You don't have to do this right now.
- No.

19:35.212 --> 19:37.980
We would like to Jay and Gloria
to be Lily's guardians.

19:38.015 --> 19:39.380
- Cam?
- It's the right decision.

19:39.415 --> 19:41.166
That is great news!

19:41.216 --> 19:43.783
Lily, when something
horrible happens,

19:43.819 --> 19:45.885
you're going to be all mine!

19:45.887 --> 19:48.520
It really is an "if" situation.

19:48.554 --> 19:49.820
All mine!

19:49.855 --> 19:52.923
I don't mean to ruin this
really beautiful moment,

19:52.957 --> 19:55.458
but were Phil and I even
considered for the position?

19:55.460 --> 19:56.424
Claire?

19:56.492 --> 19:57.758
I mean, we are the parents

19:57.793 --> 20:00.194
of three healthy,
well-adjusted children who...

20:00.227 --> 20:01.961
Honey, we need to go down
to the police station.

20:01.997 --> 20:03.496
Our daughters just
vandalized the school.

20:06.632 --> 20:08.165
This is not over.

20:08.199 --> 20:12.368
Let's go see
your new room, Liliana.

20:12.403 --> 20:16.069
No, that's not her name.

20:19.906 --> 20:21.340
Hey.

20:21.374 --> 20:22.508
Oh, hey, what are you
doing home?

20:22.542 --> 20:23.975
Oh, I bailed on yoga.

20:24.009 --> 20:25.110
Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:25.143 --> 20:26.209
Oh, oh, could you go
to the mailbox and get me...

20:26.244 --> 20:27.777
No, why can't I just come in?

20:27.812 --> 20:28.910
- You can. I just...
- Cameron?

20:28.946 --> 20:30.045
- What?
- Look at me.

20:30.112 --> 20:31.946
I am.
What did you do?

20:33.649 --> 20:35.349
I am home alone
for a lot of hours.

20:35.384 --> 20:37.349
Carmen Miranda?

20:37.385 --> 20:41.020
I just wanted a couple
before the holes closed up.

20:41.054 --> 20:42.686
- Oh, Cameron.
- Oh.

20:44.822 --> 20:47.656
- All right, just get one with me
really quick. - Okay.

20:47.690 --> 20:49.091
All right.
Hey! One for daddy!

20:49.125 --> 20:50.525
Whoo!

20:50.725 --> 20:54.724
