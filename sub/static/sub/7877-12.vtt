00:03.317 --> 00:06.085
¶ good morning, usa! ¶

00:06.153 --> 00:09.989
¶ I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day ¶

00:10.057 --> 00:12.926
¶ the sun in the sky has
a smile on his face ¶

00:12.993 --> 00:17.096
¶ and he's shining a salute
to the american race ¶

00:19.233 --> 00:22.669
¶ oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

00:22.736 --> 00:24.571
¶ good... ¶ good morning, usa ¶

00:24.638 --> 00:26.272
Aah!

00:35.416 --> 00:37.383
Did you put googly eyes on the roomba?

00:37.451 --> 00:39.185
Yeah, I like to look someone in the eyes

00:39.253 --> 00:40.653
As they clean for me.

00:40.721 --> 00:41.988
It's a power thing.

00:42.056 --> 00:43.256
Gets me off.

00:44.458 --> 00:46.326
Stan!

00:46.393 --> 00:48.728
Valentine's isn't for another two days.

00:50.231 --> 00:51.598
No, I just wanted some chocolate

00:51.665 --> 00:53.700
And they only sold them in
that box at hershy park.

00:53.767 --> 00:55.768
You went to hershy park without me?

00:55.836 --> 00:56.970
Yeah, someone told me about it.

00:57.037 --> 00:58.938
Sounded cool. That was me!

00:59.006 --> 01:01.474
For years I've been telling
you I want to go there.

01:01.542 --> 01:04.043
Well, now I know why,
because that place is awesome!

01:04.111 --> 01:05.678
Milk chocolate world is great.

01:05.746 --> 01:07.547
I loved white world.

01:07.615 --> 01:09.682
Didn't care so much for dark world.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.651
Stan, francine, look at me go!

01:14.622 --> 01:16.522
<i>Nein. Nein, roomba!</i>

01:17.825 --> 01:18.858
Oh!

01:31.171 --> 01:33.640
Yummy, yummy, sagaga!

01:34.808 --> 01:36.776
I have not remotely understood

01:36.844 --> 01:38.311
One of these japanese games.

01:38.379 --> 01:39.846
Can we just play a normal game?

01:39.914 --> 01:41.848
Hide and go pee!

01:41.916 --> 01:43.616
Barry, no!

01:50.858 --> 01:52.392
Dead lady!

01:52.459 --> 01:53.760
What is that?

01:54.962 --> 01:58.164
She tastes like a ball gag.

02:01.268 --> 02:02.468
Oh, my god.

02:02.536 --> 02:04.270
Her mouth opens.

02:04.338 --> 02:07.373
Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?

02:07.441 --> 02:10.576
<i>Shot-for-shot remake of the movie
mannequin!</i>

02:10.644 --> 02:13.479
Boys, you found... Erica.

02:13.547 --> 02:15.682
Mr. Yoshida, can we borrow your mannequin?

02:15.749 --> 02:18.751
Yes, it's a mannequin.

02:18.819 --> 02:21.621
Of course, you boys can
use this... Mannequin.

02:21.689 --> 02:24.590
Thanks!

02:24.658 --> 02:25.892
Is it clean?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.727
You know it's not clean.

02:31.632 --> 02:32.966
Ow!

02:33.033 --> 02:34.467
Sorry. I started sleeping on my side,

02:34.535 --> 02:36.069
So I need a pillow between my legs.

02:36.136 --> 02:37.370
Night!

02:37.438 --> 02:39.105
Stan, I feel like

02:39.173 --> 02:41.107
You've been taking me for granted lately.

02:41.175 --> 02:44.310
You take my pillow,
you go to hershy park without me.

02:44.378 --> 02:46.279
You always put yourself first.

02:46.347 --> 02:48.281
Okay, okay, here's what I'm gonna do:

02:48.349 --> 02:50.950
Tomorrow morning you'll be
served breakfast in bed,

02:51.018 --> 02:53.252
Like a queen or a quadriplegic.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.454
Really?

02:54.521 --> 02:56.422
For really reals. Mm-hmm.

02:56.490 --> 02:58.424
Maybe I should work up an appetite?

02:58.492 --> 03:00.026
Sorry, I have to wake up early tomorrow

03:00.094 --> 03:01.861
To make you breakfast.

03:01.929 --> 03:03.696
Oh, spider bite.

03:03.764 --> 03:05.298
Itchy spider bite.

03:05.366 --> 03:07.200
Oh, my god, it's so itchy.

03:07.267 --> 03:09.035
So itchy-- jane seymour.

03:09.103 --> 03:11.704
So...

03:11.772 --> 03:13.639
Got it.

03:16.443 --> 03:19.212
mmm, bacon.

03:24.718 --> 03:26.686
What happened to breakfast in bed?!

03:26.754 --> 03:29.022
I know! And what happened
to dressing up on airplanes

03:29.089 --> 03:30.256
And handwritten thank-you notes?

03:30.324 --> 03:31.991
You promised me!

03:32.059 --> 03:34.927
Francine, francine,
there's a good explanation.

03:34.995 --> 03:36.396
You ate it.

03:36.463 --> 03:38.031
Mm-hmm.

03:38.098 --> 03:41.034
You never think about me, do you?

03:41.101 --> 03:43.302
I bet you haven't even
considered what to get me

03:43.370 --> 03:45.304
For valentine's day tomorrow.

03:45.372 --> 03:47.874
Don't even think

03:47.941 --> 03:50.476
You can get out of this by shooting me.

03:50.544 --> 03:52.712
So you don't have anything planned.

03:52.780 --> 03:54.447
And I went to so much trouble

03:54.515 --> 03:56.182
To get you something really special.

03:56.250 --> 03:58.451
Do you want to know what I got you, stan?

03:58.519 --> 04:00.420
No, no, don't tell me!
You know I love surprises!

04:00.487 --> 04:02.355
If you ruin this for me, I swear to god...

04:02.423 --> 04:05.958
Side-by-side funeral plots
and a couple's coffin!

04:06.026 --> 04:08.127
I thought we could be buried together

04:08.195 --> 04:10.530
And hold hands for eternity.

04:10.597 --> 04:13.299
Francine, that is so sweet.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.802
And I'm really glad you told me about this.

04:15.869 --> 04:17.670
Because I won't be needing
a funeral plot. What?!

04:17.738 --> 04:20.173
I'm going to be turned
into a cyborg after I die.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.440
A cyborg?!

04:21.507 --> 04:23.309
Yeah. The cia's going to freeze me

04:23.377 --> 04:24.710
Until they have the technology

04:24.778 --> 04:26.779
To turn me into a half-man, half-robot.

04:26.847 --> 04:29.482
This is the face I'm going
to do when they freeze me.

04:29.550 --> 04:32.351
<i>It's han solo from star trek.</i>

04:32.419 --> 04:35.388
I already picked out my colors--

04:35.456 --> 04:37.290
Cobalt blue with gold trim.

04:37.357 --> 04:38.658
Sick.

04:38.725 --> 04:41.561
So... You're not going
to be buried next to me?

04:41.628 --> 04:43.463
Francine, it's "till death do us part."

04:43.530 --> 04:44.897
At death, we part.

04:44.965 --> 04:47.066
You go underground and I
go shooting into the air

04:47.134 --> 04:49.268
Flying around like a crazy robot man.

04:49.336 --> 04:50.903
Unbelievable!

04:50.971 --> 04:52.805
I don't even want to look at you.

04:52.873 --> 04:54.740
You can just sleep on the couch tonight!

04:54.808 --> 04:56.309
Hey, you guys mind keeping it down?

04:56.376 --> 04:57.910
We're shooting a movie in the next room.

04:57.978 --> 04:59.078
Thanks.

04:59.146 --> 05:00.947
A movie?

05:01.014 --> 05:03.116
Hey, guys, I was eavesdropping,

05:03.183 --> 05:04.951
But I found something better to do.

05:05.018 --> 05:06.786
I piddled some here on the rug.

05:06.854 --> 05:07.954
There's a little blood in it.

05:08.021 --> 05:09.889
So... Enjoy.

05:11.859 --> 05:13.793
Okay, this is the big scene

05:13.861 --> 05:16.796
Where the mannequin turns
into a living transvestite,

05:16.864 --> 05:18.798
Originally played by kim cattrall.

05:18.866 --> 05:20.933
And... Action!

05:21.001 --> 05:22.768
You're the first thing I've ever created

05:22.836 --> 05:24.570
That really made me feel like an artist.

05:26.006 --> 05:29.242
Sometimes I think you're the dummy!

05:29.309 --> 05:30.543
Cut! Awful.

05:30.611 --> 05:31.844
Who are you?

05:31.912 --> 05:33.346
The name's ira siegal.

05:33.413 --> 05:35.014
<i>I directed the episode of cybill</i>

05:35.082 --> 05:37.183
Where christine baranski sat on her nuts.

05:37.251 --> 05:39.218
The point is, I can direct this thing.

05:39.286 --> 05:41.220
Look how many pockets are on his jacket.

05:41.288 --> 05:43.022
I think we should let him do it.

05:43.090 --> 05:44.924
<i>I'll remake mannequin on
one condition--</i>

05:44.992 --> 05:46.259
<i>We make it goonies.</i>

05:46.326 --> 05:48.027
<i>The goonies? Why?</i>

05:48.095 --> 05:49.228
Look at you four:

05:49.296 --> 05:51.964
Fat, nerdy, smart-mouthed, asian.

05:52.032 --> 05:53.966
<i>You guys are the goonies!</i>

05:54.034 --> 05:57.370
¶ what's good enough for you ¶

05:57.437 --> 06:00.540
¶ is good enough for me ¶

06:00.607 --> 06:03.009
¶ it's good enough ¶

06:03.076 --> 06:05.044
¶ it's good enough for me ¶

06:05.112 --> 06:07.380
¶ yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah. ¶

06:25.065 --> 06:26.699
Marinate it with the marinate.

06:26.767 --> 06:28.601
Oh, that's not enough marinate.

06:28.669 --> 06:30.069
That's too much marinate.

06:30.137 --> 06:32.038
Francine! What's going on?

06:32.105 --> 06:34.473
I realized I have been selfish.

06:34.541 --> 06:36.542
It has been all about me.

06:36.610 --> 06:38.811
But it's time we make it all about you.

06:38.879 --> 06:40.780
You made me love coupons?

06:40.847 --> 06:44.217
Tomorrow's going to be the best
valentine's day of your life.

06:44.284 --> 06:45.551
It starts with brunch

06:45.619 --> 06:48.387
And gets progressively
more romantic as it goes.

06:48.455 --> 06:50.389
It ends with us doing something so dirty,

06:50.457 --> 06:52.959
We'll both have intestinal
distress for a month.

06:53.026 --> 06:53.993
Ooh!

06:54.061 --> 06:55.628
And that's not all.

06:55.696 --> 06:58.731
I've also decided to join
you in that lovers' coffin.

06:58.799 --> 07:02.034
This is the cia contract that
I signed to become a cyborg.

07:04.204 --> 07:06.138
Oh, stan! I love you!

07:18.785 --> 07:20.152
What's happening?!

07:23.490 --> 07:25.491
Stan, I'm you from the future.

07:25.559 --> 07:26.859
We need to talk.

07:26.927 --> 07:28.828
Oh, my god, it's me!

07:28.895 --> 07:30.830
As a cyborg!

07:30.897 --> 07:32.098
I'm awesome!

07:32.165 --> 07:34.467
But you tore up the contract.

07:34.534 --> 07:36.369
Wait.

07:36.436 --> 07:39.005
This is the dishwasher warranty!

07:39.072 --> 07:41.574
What happens if it breaks down?!

07:41.642 --> 07:42.808
It does!

07:48.468 --> 07:50.370
Francine, look how cool I am as a cyborg!

07:50.838 --> 07:53.439
: Stan, I've traveled back,
like, a thousand years, mang.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.041
We need to talk "aboot" the future.

07:55.109 --> 07:56.543
Why do you have an accent?

07:56.610 --> 07:59.412
Yeah, it's like a mix
of mexican and canadian.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.049
Oh, yeah, yeah, america gets
taken over by mexico and canada

08:03.117 --> 08:05.084
In, like, a hundred years or something.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.087
My god, a great nation defeated

08:08.155 --> 08:10.757
By an army of gardeners and boring people.

08:10.825 --> 08:13.226
Stan, in the future, the machines rise up

08:13.294 --> 08:15.195
And try to destroy the human race.

08:15.262 --> 08:18.164
I need to train you so you
can stop it from happening.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.133
You'll save the world, mang, eh?

08:20.201 --> 08:22.135
I save the world?!

08:22.203 --> 08:23.670
I knew it.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.971
knew it.

08:25.039 --> 08:26.639
I can't believe you lied to me

08:26.707 --> 08:28.641
About ripping up that contract.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.643
That's it. Out of here, both of you!

08:30.711 --> 08:32.979
I'm going back to bed alone.

08:33.047 --> 08:35.014
Francine...

08:35.082 --> 08:36.349
Fine.

08:36.417 --> 08:38.451
I have so much to ask you about the future!

08:38.519 --> 08:41.154
Like, do I ever truly fall in love?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.594
Wakey, wakey, gringo.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.962
Early...

08:49.029 --> 08:51.364
If you're going to save the
world in a thousand years,

08:51.432 --> 08:53.900
We gotta spend all your
time getting ready, okay?

08:53.968 --> 08:56.069
The evil machines of the future

08:56.136 --> 08:58.071
Are based on today's electronics, okay?

08:58.138 --> 09:00.974
So take these things apart
and learn how they function.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.709
How they think, ese.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.244
You got a problem with me?!

09:05.479 --> 09:07.146
You don't even know me!

09:08.616 --> 09:09.916
Roomba!

09:09.984 --> 09:11.918
Stan! I love that thing!

09:11.986 --> 09:13.519
She's soft on the machines.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.854
Probably betray us.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.556
Should we, uh, kill her now?

09:16.624 --> 09:18.558
Look, it's valentine's day,

09:18.626 --> 09:20.526
And I want to go to brunch.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.429
Francine, I must train.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.798
These coupons say they're good anytime.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.867
I'll be in the car.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.437
Looks like no training
today for me, future stan.

09:31.505 --> 09:34.540
Not necessarily, "bromigo."

09:36.744 --> 09:38.711
Okay, let's go, mama.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.246
I'm not going anywhere with you.

09:40.314 --> 09:41.581
The coupon didn't say anything

09:41.649 --> 09:43.182
About which stan it has to be.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.118
Have fun, you two.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.627
Treasure map!

09:54.695 --> 09:56.062
Cut! Ugh!

09:56.130 --> 09:57.630
We've done this 40 times!

09:57.698 --> 09:59.632
What's wrong now? I hate your face!

09:59.700 --> 10:01.534
Do it again!

10:01.602 --> 10:03.303
And... Action!

10:04.471 --> 10:07.073
A treasure map.

10:07.141 --> 10:09.175
One-eyed willy buried a treasure

10:09.243 --> 10:11.644
That was full of diamonds and emeralds...

10:11.712 --> 10:12.912
Give it to me! I'll kill you!

10:12.980 --> 10:14.847
The treasure's mine!

10:16.984 --> 10:18.584
Oh. Right.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.019
Right, well, great work then.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.587
Very convincing, steve.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.589
So convincing that I ruined the shot.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.591
So, let's take it from the top.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.660
Right after I get that treasure!

10:29.697 --> 10:31.664
Don't go anywhere, I'm on my way back.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.566
I remember what we're doing again.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.302
I know this situation

10:36.370 --> 10:38.338
Isn't exactly ideal for you.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.306
But spending the day with a beautiful woman,

10:40.374 --> 10:43.109
That's pretty ideal for me, mang.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.149
It's japanese funk.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.685
Give it a chance,
everybody loves it in the future.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.520
¶ ¶

11:01.695 --> 11:04.464
¶ ¶

11:32.593 --> 11:35.361
¶ ¶

11:37.064 --> 11:42.301
This actually turned out to be
a really nice valentine's day.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.669
I've missed you.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.571
You know, the last time I saw you,

11:45.639 --> 11:47.206
You were in the electric chair.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.708
You looked so tired.

11:48.776 --> 11:51.477
You'd been running for so long.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.047
Hey, guys!

11:54.114 --> 11:56.115
Stan, what did you do?!

11:56.183 --> 11:57.917
I won the first battle, francine.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.385
But not yet the war.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.587
I must rest.

12:01.655 --> 12:04.424
Ugh! I-I-I can't deal with him right now.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.062
Oh, I remember that dream.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.229
It's a puppy dream.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.131
Eat those puppies, stan.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.367
Eat them till you're full.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.543
Aren't you gonna eat?

12:23.610 --> 12:25.278
I could but it's not logical.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.247
It would just be for pleasure.

12:28.315 --> 12:32.185
Mmm, this french toast is so good.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.319
You have to try it.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.460
Nice bite, nardo.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.061
Come on, let's train.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.865
Okay, stan, in the future,
all fighting happens very low

12:45.933 --> 12:48.968
Because future armor protects
everyone from the mid-calf up.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.170
So, I'm gonna show you
some kicks and punches

12:51.238 --> 12:53.039
That attack the ankles.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.608
Okay, so, this is the move.

12:55.676 --> 12:58.678
Sweep low, chop low, swing low.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.647
Got it. You don't have to tell me twice;
I remember it exactly.

13:01.715 --> 13:05.151
Chop low, rob lowe, chad lowe.

13:05.219 --> 13:08.054
Chop low, rob lowe, chad lowe.

13:08.122 --> 13:10.389
Chop low, rob lowe, chad lowe...

13:13.560 --> 13:16.295
We have to talk about our feelings, homes.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.730
I'm a married woman.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.632
Yeah, you're married to me, hyna.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.301
Oh, yeah.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.836
I... I-I guess.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.204
I'm stan.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.473
Just a more evolved stan.

13:27.541 --> 13:31.043
A stan who spent a thousand
lonely years without you, mang,

13:31.111 --> 13:33.045
And realized you're the most important thing

13:33.113 --> 13:34.380
In the world, eh?

13:36.583 --> 13:39.986
This is too crazy! Y-y-you're a robot!

13:41.822 --> 13:45.458
Cyborg stan: That man will
let you down again and again.

13:45.526 --> 13:48.227
I know because I was that man.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.296
You deserve better, dawg.

13:50.364 --> 13:53.366
I'm so confused, dawg.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.139
Stan, we need to talk.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.641
What is it, another coupon?

14:01.708 --> 14:04.110
The coupons are all gone, brah.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.813
But... What about all the
sexy coupons at the end?

14:11.118 --> 14:13.586
You two did the tennessee logjammer!

14:13.654 --> 14:15.021
Where are the other two guys?

14:15.088 --> 14:17.023
And did you at least put my ladder back?

14:17.090 --> 14:20.459
This isn't easy to say, but I'm leaving you.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.827
For you.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.329
In the future.

14:23.397 --> 14:25.464
But now. What?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.200
You can't leave me for me.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.869
And besides, he's only here to
train me for the future war.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.737
There is no future war.

14:31.805 --> 14:33.005
I made it all up.

14:33.073 --> 14:36.375
I actually came back to
steal francine from you.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.277
You bastard!

14:40.047 --> 14:41.414
I guess I should go release

14:41.481 --> 14:43.916
The rice cooker from the internment camp.

14:58.001 --> 14:59.470
How could you sleep with another man?

15:00.187 --> 15:02.122
He's not another man, stan.

15:02.189 --> 15:03.623
He's you.

15:03.691 --> 15:06.359
A more thoughtful version of you.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.794
He even agreed to get in

15:07.862 --> 15:10.330
The lovers' coffin with me when I die.

15:10.398 --> 15:13.366
I never die, so I'm just
gonna lie next to her forever

15:13.434 --> 15:16.302
And stroke her hair and do
nice stuff like that to her.

15:16.370 --> 15:18.071
Oh, cybee.

15:18.139 --> 15:20.540
I'm more romantic than this joker.

15:20.608 --> 15:22.475
You gotta give me another chance.

15:22.543 --> 15:24.511
I swear, tomorrow I will give you

15:24.578 --> 15:27.047
The most romantic day of your life.

15:27.114 --> 15:28.982
I don't know, present stan.

15:29.917 --> 15:31.584
Okay.

15:31.652 --> 15:33.853
Thank you! You won't regret it!

15:33.921 --> 15:35.188
I hate you.

15:35.256 --> 15:38.058
Hey, brah, I make it up to you.
How about a handy j?

15:39.527 --> 15:42.362
What, it's not gay-- it's you on you.

15:43.531 --> 15:44.998
Action.

15:45.066 --> 15:46.933
<i>Down here it's our time!</i>

15:47.001 --> 15:49.502
<i>It's our time down here!</i>

15:49.570 --> 15:51.604
Ow! What the hell?

15:51.672 --> 15:53.740
I'm getting more acting out of the sex doll!

15:54.942 --> 15:56.609
Sex doll?!

15:56.677 --> 15:58.745
Ew! I've been keeping my gum in its mouth!

15:58.813 --> 15:59.946
That's it!

16:00.014 --> 16:01.314
I'm through with this movie!

16:01.382 --> 16:02.982
I'd rather do another one

16:03.050 --> 16:05.919
Of my uncle's secret basement movies!

16:05.986 --> 16:08.555
But I got too old.

16:08.622 --> 16:10.356
Guys, wait.

16:10.424 --> 16:12.692
Kids always talk about doing
remakes of their favorite movies,

16:12.760 --> 16:14.627
But they never see it through.

16:14.695 --> 16:16.062
We can't quit.

16:16.130 --> 16:17.764
<i>This is our time.</i>

16:17.832 --> 16:19.732
<i>It's our time down here.</i>

16:21.836 --> 16:23.069
I'm in.

16:23.137 --> 16:24.437
Me, too.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.439
Give me that map!

16:26.507 --> 16:27.774
The treasure is ours!

16:27.842 --> 16:29.008
We're rich, baby!

16:29.076 --> 16:30.410
Just like we talked about.

16:38.986 --> 16:41.454
I know you promised francine
a romantic day tomorrow,

16:41.522 --> 16:43.423
But I can't let that happen.

16:43.491 --> 16:47.160
Time to send you into the past.

16:56.237 --> 16:57.971
Hayley! I overslept. Where's your mom?

16:58.038 --> 17:00.406
She went to hershy park with your cyborg.

17:10.718 --> 17:13.353
Thanks for doing the chocolate
tunnel of love with me again.

17:13.420 --> 17:15.255
I was scared the first time,

17:15.321 --> 17:16.856
But once I relaxed,

17:16.924 --> 17:19.692
I was surprised how much I liked it.

17:24.732 --> 17:26.933
Don't!

17:27.001 --> 17:28.434
Sweep low!

17:28.502 --> 17:29.469
Rob lowe!

17:29.537 --> 17:31.104
Chad lowe!

17:33.574 --> 17:35.708
Augustus! No!

17:57.031 --> 17:59.499
Ugh.

18:31.665 --> 18:33.466
Damn it!

18:33.534 --> 18:36.236
Why did I join that stupid cyborg program?

18:36.303 --> 18:37.537
Wait!

18:37.605 --> 18:40.473
If never join the program, you won't exist.

18:40.541 --> 18:42.408
I'll just rip up my cyborg contract!

18:43.744 --> 18:45.845
Sorry, stan, I knew we'd think of that.

18:47.214 --> 18:49.015
You are just a stinker!

18:49.083 --> 18:50.917
Francine, listen.

18:50.985 --> 18:52.919
I love you. I get it.

18:52.987 --> 18:54.287
And I'm going to start being attentive

18:54.355 --> 18:56.356
To your wants and needs.

18:56.423 --> 19:00.059
If you really believe that,
then, here, take the contract.

19:00.127 --> 19:02.128
It's your choice, eh?

19:02.196 --> 19:04.397
You can rip it up and get your wife back.

19:04.465 --> 19:07.333
Or you can let francine be happy with me.

19:07.401 --> 19:09.435
What's it going to be, ese?

19:09.503 --> 19:11.971
What you want or what she wants?

19:12.039 --> 19:13.873
What I want! Duh!

19:16.243 --> 19:18.344
Oh, my god, what am I saying?

19:18.412 --> 19:20.246
I haven't changed.

19:22.216 --> 19:26.219
Francine, if it takes a thousand
years of loneliness and misery

19:26.287 --> 19:28.254
For me to finally
understand how to treat you,

19:28.322 --> 19:30.290
Then so be it.

19:30.357 --> 19:32.191
I just want you to be happy.

19:40.234 --> 19:42.268
That's all I needed to hear.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.141
The refrigerator manual?!

19:48.208 --> 19:51.110
I'm still stan.

20:02.956 --> 20:07.393
: Chad... Lowe...!

20:07.461 --> 20:11.331
: Yeah?

20:23.043 --> 20:25.878
Oh, choc-blocked me, bro.

20:32.419 --> 20:37.724
I'm never going to let go
of this hand, ever again.

20:37.791 --> 20:41.961
