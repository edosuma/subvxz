WEBVTT

00:02.551 --> 00:05.053
I know you're in there, Charlie.

00:05.087 --> 00:07.388
I'm gonna get you back,

00:07.423 --> 00:11.092
and since patience has never
been my strong suit...

00:12.594 --> 00:15.780
Coma arousal therapy.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.184
I'm gonna stimulate your senses, baby.

00:26.408 --> 00:27.725
Smell...

00:28.777 --> 00:31.028
Oh, no, not the perfume.

00:31.062 --> 00:33.448
You're killing me.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:55.521 --> 00:56.771
Touch.

00:56.805 --> 00:59.357
Wow. Whoever invented this therapy

00:59.391 --> 01:02.026
is an evil, evil genius.

01:03.328 --> 01:04.929
I feel ridiculous.

01:04.947 --> 01:07.648
Don't stop. You feel amazing.

01:09.284 --> 01:10.902
- Dr. Reid?
- Jackson!

01:10.936 --> 01:12.737
- Sorry.
- No. Wait.

01:12.771 --> 01:15.323
I... no, wait. I'm just, you know, I'm...

01:15.374 --> 01:19.827
I'm doing this thing called
coma arousal therapy.

01:19.878 --> 01:20.962
His finger moved, so...

01:20.996 --> 01:23.514
Yeah. I need to suction his phlegm.

01:23.549 --> 01:27.418
Of course. Right.

01:30.506 --> 01:32.557
Yeah, excuse me.

01:35.711 --> 01:37.745
You're not going to die.

01:37.779 --> 01:39.180
You're going to get better.

01:44.803 --> 01:47.488
I tell my patients
you have to believe that.

01:47.523 --> 01:50.608
At least you have to try.

01:54.346 --> 01:57.999
It's like one of those bets
you make with yourself.

01:58.033 --> 01:59.650
If I can get all the way
to the ground floor

01:59.668 --> 02:02.803
without anyone getting on,

02:02.838 --> 02:05.756
everything is gonna turn
out okay.

02:08.426 --> 02:10.494
Yes!

02:17.736 --> 02:18.953
Wouldn't believe it,

02:18.987 --> 02:21.522
but this place has
the best cappuccinos in town.

02:21.557 --> 02:24.025
Would this be considered a walk of shame?

02:24.059 --> 02:26.644
I think technically 'cause
we're still together,

02:26.678 --> 02:29.063
we're pretty safe.

02:29.114 --> 02:31.616
I'm guessing you're a bit of an expert.

02:31.650 --> 02:32.783
Maggie.

02:32.818 --> 02:34.685
Joel.

02:34.703 --> 02:36.988
I had a great time, really.

02:37.022 --> 02:38.172
Yeah. But...

02:38.207 --> 02:39.356
No "buts."

02:39.374 --> 02:40.625
It was fun.

02:40.659 --> 02:42.043
Maggie!

02:42.077 --> 02:44.378
Oh. Oh, crap.
Act cool. Hey.

02:44.413 --> 02:46.714
I didn't know
you knew about this place.

02:46.748 --> 02:49.567
What? Are you kidding?
The cappuccinos. Hello.

02:49.601 --> 02:51.852
Wow. Psychiatry.

02:51.887 --> 02:53.537
Wish I had time for a sit-down breakfast.

02:53.555 --> 02:56.674
Did you guys come in together?

02:56.708 --> 02:59.383
- Oh, we just ran into each other.
- We have a consult on a patient, and, um...

02:59.807 --> 03:01.128
Yeah, we're now gonna sit down

03:01.173 --> 03:02.378
- and consult on this patient.
- She's gonna... help me.

03:02.397 --> 03:03.781
- Yeah.
- Right.

03:04.901 --> 03:07.184
Cool. Hey, uh,
flag me down when you're done.

03:07.218 --> 03:09.053
We'll all head in together?

03:09.071 --> 03:12.275
- Oh, I have a car.
- Great. Thank you. Save me.

03:12.316 --> 03:14.725
Yesterday's bus ride, I sat in cheese.

03:14.743 --> 03:15.726
Wow.

03:15.744 --> 03:17.278
And I was wearing my cords.

03:17.329 --> 03:18.579
Don't wear cords.

03:18.614 --> 03:20.865
Enjoy your brecky.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.343
- Reycraft.
- Busy.

03:32.377 --> 03:34.078
Reycraft, listen.

03:34.096 --> 03:36.631
If I needed some time off,
would you cover me?

03:36.682 --> 03:38.799
Mat leave? Who's your baby daddy?

03:38.850 --> 03:41.135
Seriously, would you?

03:41.186 --> 03:42.586
You mean be chief surgical resident

03:42.604 --> 03:44.272
while you were gone?

03:44.306 --> 03:45.890
Not your call.

03:45.924 --> 03:49.110
I know. Kinney would have to okay it. So?

03:49.144 --> 03:52.196
- What's the catch?
- There is no catch.

03:53.365 --> 03:57.735
Sure. I got your back.

03:57.769 --> 03:59.603
Hey.

03:59.621 --> 04:00.955
Just don't stick a scalpel in it.

04:00.989 --> 04:03.107
Look, you take as much
time off as you need.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.625
I'll do your job.

04:04.660 --> 04:06.961
Just can't guarantee I'll give it back.

04:06.995 --> 04:10.998
"Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look."

04:11.049 --> 04:14.284
"He thinks too much:
such men are dangerous."

04:16.922 --> 04:18.622
Did you get laid last night?

04:18.640 --> 04:19.790
I'm sorry?

04:19.808 --> 04:21.309
You always rock the Shakespeare

04:21.343 --> 04:23.344
- when you're feeling conquer-y.
- I do not.

04:23.395 --> 04:27.148
You do. So who's the lucky Juliet, Romeo?

04:27.182 --> 04:28.632
I don't kiss and tell.

04:28.650 --> 04:31.018
You barely even kiss.

04:31.069 --> 04:32.520
So I heard about Charlie.

04:33.905 --> 04:35.156
Moving.

04:35.190 --> 04:37.474
Could be a host of things.

04:39.494 --> 04:41.195
Look, just 'cause he moves a finger,

04:41.246 --> 04:43.280
doesn't mean he's gonna wake up today.

04:43.315 --> 04:44.999
But it doesn't mean he won't.

04:47.653 --> 04:48.886
Okay, let me hear it.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.955
Now is the knee too much?

04:50.989 --> 04:52.923
No, no, no, the knee totally makes it.

04:52.958 --> 04:54.041
All right.

04:54.092 --> 04:55.793
I can't imagine my life without you,

04:55.827 --> 04:58.796
so, Karen Ann Churley,

04:58.830 --> 05:00.297
will you marry me?

05:00.331 --> 05:01.332
Why, yes, I will.

05:03.935 --> 05:07.938
- Who's this guy?
- This is your consult.

05:07.973 --> 05:09.023
Where's the hardware?

05:09.057 --> 05:11.192
Uh, being sized. Tiffany's.

05:11.226 --> 05:14.228
So, Mr. Munk, what can I do for you today?

05:14.279 --> 05:17.948
Uh, sorry. Um, I'm flying
to San Fran tomorrow

05:17.983 --> 05:19.533
to surprise my girlfriend.

05:19.568 --> 05:21.869
Still don't quite know how
I'm gonna do it, though.

05:21.903 --> 05:23.371
Early in the evening from the heart,

05:23.405 --> 05:26.157
and if it's not from France,
it's not champagne.

05:26.191 --> 05:27.191
Ah.

05:27.209 --> 05:28.826
- I'm Dr. Reid.
- Hi.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.294
Wanna come over here and
hop on the bed, Benjamin?

05:30.328 --> 05:31.412
Sure.

05:31.463 --> 05:33.080
You having problems in your abdomen?

05:33.131 --> 05:34.815
Relax your abdominal muscles.

05:34.850 --> 05:38.219
You have a lot of scarring
on your belly. Sutures?

05:38.253 --> 05:40.504
Oh. Uh, yeah, pyloric stenosis
when I was a week old.

05:40.538 --> 05:42.256
And then multiple operations,

05:42.307 --> 05:44.558
laparatomies for bowel obstructions.

05:44.593 --> 05:46.260
My dad's a surgeon.

05:46.311 --> 05:49.013
- Where did he practice?
- Well, right now

05:49.047 --> 05:50.881
he's in Malawi fixing cleft palates.

05:50.899 --> 05:52.049
Hmm. Impressive.

05:52.067 --> 05:53.601
Yeah, he thinks so.

05:53.652 --> 05:56.153
Multiple traumas, one minute out.

05:56.188 --> 05:58.806
I actually think he knows a surgeon here.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.357
I can't remember his name,

06:00.392 --> 06:02.243
but supposedly he was
this mad orthopedic genius.

06:02.277 --> 06:03.527
- Joel Goran.
- Charlie Harris.

06:03.561 --> 06:05.696
Ah, Harris. That's him, yeah.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.564
He's my fiance.

06:07.582 --> 06:08.749
Oh, cool.

06:08.784 --> 06:10.734
Right there.

06:10.752 --> 06:13.621
- Hey, how did he propose?
- Um, we should probably...

06:13.672 --> 06:17.675
Well, you can tell him that, uh,
Dr. Munk from Winnipeg says hi.

06:17.709 --> 06:20.544
I will. I need a full blood panel.

06:20.578 --> 06:22.463
Mm-hmm. Coags, group and screen.

06:22.514 --> 06:25.415
And do a F.A.S.T. and, Mr. Munk?

06:25.434 --> 06:27.701
- Yeah?
- Any other concerns,

06:27.736 --> 06:29.887
especially about how to propose?
She's your gal.

06:29.921 --> 06:31.472
Okay?

06:31.523 --> 06:34.442
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

06:37.428 --> 06:40.481
2 males, early 20s.
Roofing accident. Brothers.

06:40.532 --> 06:42.900
Talk to me.

06:42.934 --> 06:46.070
Tachycardic, hypotensive
with a B.P. 80 over 60.

06:46.104 --> 06:47.437
They bolused 3 liters of saline,

06:47.456 --> 06:48.939
and he's only a transient responder.

06:48.957 --> 06:51.942
G.C.S. 6. Appears to
have landed on something.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.327
Fluids in the abdomen?

06:53.378 --> 06:55.996
Where's Isaac? Where's my brother?

06:56.047 --> 06:59.500
Isaac! You all right, buddy?

06:59.551 --> 07:02.636
Aah! Aah!

07:02.671 --> 07:05.973
Superficial abrasions to the face.

07:06.007 --> 07:09.260
Severe open femur fracture.
It's a de-gloving injury.

07:09.294 --> 07:11.262
- It's okay, buddy. So let's get 50 more fentanyl.
- Scissors.

07:11.296 --> 07:12.596
Let's get him into traction here.

07:12.630 --> 07:14.464
Don't let
my brother die, please.

07:14.483 --> 07:17.935
- Just relax, bud. Just relax.
- How far did your brother fall?

07:17.969 --> 07:20.271
From a roof. I don't know. 30 feet?

07:21.990 --> 07:23.407
Broken ribs.

07:23.441 --> 07:25.025
Flail chest.

07:25.076 --> 07:26.827
Tight abdomen.

07:26.862 --> 07:28.662
- Okay.
- Possible pneumothorax.

07:28.697 --> 07:29.947
I'm really worried about this liver.

07:29.981 --> 07:31.916
Let's get this guy out of here.
Let's move.

07:33.869 --> 07:35.286
Let's go. Come on.

07:37.989 --> 07:41.675
Suction. I need a clean field of vision.

07:42.761 --> 07:44.328
Right lobe of the liver is lacerated.

07:44.346 --> 07:45.462
What do you see?

07:45.496 --> 07:47.631
Fractured ribs, open book pelvis.

07:47.665 --> 07:50.467
Okay, we're gonna have to pack
to get control and then pringle.

07:50.501 --> 07:51.602
You're gonna pringle?

07:51.636 --> 07:53.354
I know. I don't like it,

07:53.388 --> 07:54.939
but we're gonna need all
the help we can get.

07:54.973 --> 07:56.506
Ladies first.

07:56.525 --> 07:58.008
Screw that. Start packing.

07:58.026 --> 07:59.643
There's this cartoon I remember
seeing once

07:59.677 --> 08:00.945
when I was a kid...

08:00.979 --> 08:03.564
a little guy hanging
onto a palm tree,

08:03.615 --> 08:05.566
and the tree was swaying
back and forth

08:05.617 --> 08:08.319
in this monsoon wind one side,

08:08.353 --> 08:09.570
and then all the way to the other.

08:09.621 --> 08:11.071
B.P.'s falling.

08:11.122 --> 08:14.041
Son of a bitch. Will you look at that?

08:14.075 --> 08:15.326
Clamp.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.494
And this little guy was
just hanging on

08:17.528 --> 08:19.530
for dear life.

08:19.564 --> 08:21.165
Oh, god.

08:21.199 --> 08:23.384
That's me.

08:23.418 --> 08:24.585
That's me.

08:24.619 --> 08:26.303
Be calm. It's gonna be okay.

08:27.923 --> 08:29.873
It's just coming out everywhere now.

08:29.891 --> 08:31.342
No, one more right where that came from.

08:31.376 --> 08:32.592
Yeah.

08:32.644 --> 08:34.260
Why is that happening?

08:34.296 --> 08:35.929
What's wrong? Why is there so much blood?

08:35.964 --> 08:37.648
Your broken rib has skewered your liver.

08:37.682 --> 08:41.085
Your right lobe has exploded.
Well, that doesn't sound too good.

08:41.119 --> 08:43.120
It's not. You're in rough shape.

08:43.154 --> 08:45.489
- He's arresting. Start C.P.R. Lindsay?
- Yes, sir?

08:45.523 --> 08:47.441
- I can't see what I'm doing here.
- Code blue!

08:47.492 --> 08:48.525
- Sponges.
- All right, give me 2 units of blood

08:48.559 --> 08:50.027
and push 1 milligram of epi.

08:50.061 --> 08:51.195
Can we get some help here, please?

08:51.229 --> 08:53.197
No pulse. I'm opening saline.

08:53.231 --> 08:55.916
O.R. 1, code blue. O.R. 1.

08:55.951 --> 08:57.534
He's decompensating, guys.

08:57.568 --> 09:00.454
Any results? Are these
fluids getting to him?

09:00.505 --> 09:02.289
Nothing yet. No pulse.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.074
Come on, Isaac.

09:04.092 --> 09:06.243
- No blood pressure.
- Victor?

09:06.261 --> 09:09.129
He's still asystolic.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.798
We're losing him. I need more sponges.

09:10.849 --> 09:12.049
Joel, are you getting tired?
You want me to sub in?

09:12.083 --> 09:15.886
No, I'm okay. Give me one more on epi.

09:17.555 --> 09:18.973
I can't stop this bleeding.

09:21.426 --> 09:24.895
No. He's bleeding out.
Start him on platelets.

09:24.929 --> 09:27.815
I'm continuing C.P.R.

09:27.866 --> 09:31.986
And I just knew, watching,

09:32.037 --> 09:35.739
that no matter how hard
he held onto that tree...

09:36.941 --> 09:38.442
with the wind that strong...

09:40.778 --> 09:44.448
sometimes you just can't hold on.

09:52.457 --> 09:54.308
- Call it.
- Time of death...

09:54.342 --> 09:56.960
11:42 A.M.

10:16.882 --> 10:19.033
Well, Mr. Munk,
your hemoglobin's 95.

10:19.068 --> 10:20.851
Uh, in english, please?

10:20.869 --> 10:23.121
It should be 130. You're anemic.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.373
- Oh.
- It's good news. It explains your fatigue.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.659
I'm just gonna write you
a script for oral iron.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.377
It'll make your stool
as black as charcoal,

10:29.411 --> 10:31.329
- but don't be alarmed.
- Uh, sorry.

10:31.363 --> 10:33.097
I'm anemic? That's all?

10:33.132 --> 10:34.799
Yeah. When you get back,
we'll do some follow-up tests,

10:34.833 --> 10:36.534
but you're free to get on that plane.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.720
I'll just be a minute, okay?

10:40.055 --> 10:42.540
That is a hefty tome of paperwork.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.226
"The swallower" is in the house.

10:45.260 --> 10:47.662
She swallowed my phone. Not even kidding.

10:47.696 --> 10:48.863
Swallowed my phone.

10:48.897 --> 10:50.565
I don't even know how she got it down.

10:50.599 --> 10:52.718
She's like the Linda Lovelace
of hospital patients.

10:53.249 --> 10:53.884
Yikes.

10:53.902 --> 10:56.220
Now she's like Captain Hook,
ringing from the inside,

10:56.238 --> 10:57.388
'cause my phone's in there,

10:57.406 --> 10:59.073
and I don't know who's calling me.

10:59.108 --> 11:00.575
That's a hell of a story, Gav.

11:00.609 --> 11:03.127
Um, are you sitting on
the discharge papers?

11:03.162 --> 11:05.496
Uh, yes. Here you go.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.949
Thank you.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.335
Hey, uh, do you wanna
maybe catch a drink later?

11:11.370 --> 11:13.004
Where is my patient?

11:23.465 --> 11:25.950
Hey, Mr. Munk you wandered off.

11:25.984 --> 11:27.769
- Benjamin?
- Yeah. Uh, sorry.

11:27.803 --> 11:30.187
I just felt a little dizzy.

11:30.205 --> 11:31.989
Are you okay?

11:32.024 --> 11:34.409
Um, I actually feel, uh, not so good.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.493
All right.

11:35.527 --> 11:37.211
I-I really gotta go, so...

11:37.246 --> 11:38.663
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Benjamin.

11:39.164 --> 11:41.549
- I need help here.
- Um, uh...

11:43.919 --> 11:45.353
So when did you die?

11:45.387 --> 11:47.555
I didn't die. I'm in a coma.

11:47.589 --> 11:50.591
Coma. Lucky you.

11:50.642 --> 11:51.843
So...

11:51.877 --> 11:53.478
what happens next?

11:53.512 --> 11:56.046
Uh, your body's taken to the morgue.

11:56.064 --> 11:57.365
And the rest of me?

11:57.399 --> 11:59.884
No idea.

11:59.902 --> 12:00.985
It's the end of my limited experience.

12:01.019 --> 12:03.955
You either wake up, or you die.

12:03.989 --> 12:06.390
And when you die, you disappear.

12:06.408 --> 12:08.392
So...

12:08.410 --> 12:10.111
why am I still here?

12:10.145 --> 12:15.233
That's a very good question.

12:29.014 --> 12:32.800
Mr. Wolfe, I'm Dr. Goran.

12:32.851 --> 12:36.387
Are you one of the docs
that operated on my brother?

12:36.421 --> 12:37.922
I am.

12:37.940 --> 12:40.608
And I'm sorry for your loss.

12:40.642 --> 12:44.829
So is there anyone
we should contact? Parents?

12:44.863 --> 12:46.731
They're in Trinidad.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.266
A wife or a girlfriend?

12:49.284 --> 12:51.486
No.

12:51.520 --> 12:56.707
Okay, your scans show that
you have significant trauma

12:56.742 --> 12:59.126
to the articular surface of the knee.

12:59.161 --> 13:02.730
I'm just gonna check,
see if you have any sensation.

13:02.764 --> 13:04.999
- Can you feel that?
- Yeah.

13:05.033 --> 13:08.769
So you and your brother
have a roofing company?

13:10.422 --> 13:11.822
His big dream.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.591
Not yours?

13:13.625 --> 13:16.677
Isaac got 500 ball caps made.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.513
Advertising.

13:18.547 --> 13:23.768
He said that, uh,
business cards were old school.

13:25.587 --> 13:28.406
He wore that cap everywhere.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.492
Mr. Wolfe, you are missing
a part of your distal femur,

13:31.527 --> 13:33.961
and you have major soft
tissue damage here.

13:33.996 --> 13:36.981
I have to operate on this immediately.

13:37.015 --> 13:39.951
You're gonna lose a part of your leg.

13:43.055 --> 13:44.488
Mr. Wolfe?

13:44.522 --> 13:47.792
I heard you.

13:50.028 --> 13:52.547
So there's a couple of options
for us to discuss here.

13:52.581 --> 13:56.584
One is called a Van Ness rotationplasty.

13:56.635 --> 13:57.885
I amputate your leg,

13:57.920 --> 14:00.521
I rotate it 180 degrees

14:00.556 --> 14:01.806
And then re-attach it.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.176
Essentially, your working
ankle will become your knee.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.211
After that, you attach
a small prosthetic to it.

14:07.246 --> 14:10.848
With that, you can run, you can jump.

14:10.882 --> 14:12.984
Keep working.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.235
Whatever.

14:14.269 --> 14:17.038
Do whatever you want.

14:17.072 --> 14:19.723
I don't care.

14:22.210 --> 14:25.246
He just collapsed.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.764
Benjamin, how are you feeling now?

14:26.798 --> 14:28.532
Uh, worse.

14:28.566 --> 14:29.900
You still feeling nauseous?

14:29.918 --> 14:31.953
What's, uh, what's happening?

14:32.004 --> 14:34.956
We're gonna do everything
we can to figure that out.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.408
Any other new symptoms?

14:37.426 --> 14:39.293
Lower quadrant cramping.

14:39.344 --> 14:43.130
I think it's colorectal.
I was about to discharge him.

14:43.181 --> 14:44.966
It's a good thing you didn't.

14:45.017 --> 14:46.968
Yeah, I told him to go
off and get married.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.586
He will, after we get him better.

14:49.605 --> 14:50.721
Dr. Reid!

14:53.475 --> 14:56.760
What's wrong with me?

15:00.699 --> 15:02.400
Cancer?

15:02.434 --> 15:03.901
Yes, in your immediate family,

15:03.935 --> 15:06.770
not uncles or great aunts.

15:06.788 --> 15:08.789
I'm adopted. I-I told her.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.992
He did. No known medical history.

15:11.026 --> 15:12.910
Is there anything we should know?

15:12.944 --> 15:14.629
Mr. Munk?

15:14.663 --> 15:17.298
A few years ago,
I hunted down my birth mother,

15:17.332 --> 15:20.084
but she had passed away from colon cancer.

15:20.118 --> 15:21.285
How old was she?

15:21.303 --> 15:22.720
32.

15:22.754 --> 15:24.672
The hospital said it was,
uh, Lynch something.

15:24.723 --> 15:27.341
Lynch syndrome.
It's also called H.N.P.C.C.

15:27.392 --> 15:29.243
Oh.

15:29.277 --> 15:30.461
What?

15:30.479 --> 15:32.563
Lynch syndrome is hereditary.

15:32.597 --> 15:34.899
Dr. Lin, can you get
the colon prep started?

15:34.933 --> 15:36.067
Yeah.

15:38.854 --> 15:40.905
You can lie back, Benjamin.

15:43.775 --> 15:45.359
Your symptoms indicate

15:45.410 --> 15:47.278
that there's something
wrong in your stomach,

15:47.312 --> 15:50.147
but your pain suggests
that it's much lower down,

15:50.165 --> 15:51.482
like a bowel tumor.

15:51.500 --> 15:54.118
Oh, god.

15:54.152 --> 15:55.753
I hate hospitals.

15:55.787 --> 15:58.506
My dad used to drag me to work sometimes.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.391
No fun for a 5-year-old.

16:00.425 --> 16:02.143
Is this for my stenosis?

16:02.177 --> 16:03.961
I don't think so.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.563
Well, the other doctors said

16:05.597 --> 16:07.264
they couldn't operate laparoscopically

16:07.298 --> 16:08.933
because of all the scarring, so...

16:08.967 --> 16:10.401
So I have cancer?

16:12.070 --> 16:14.321
Let's not jump to conclusions.

16:14.356 --> 16:16.991
Yeah. I-I just...

16:17.025 --> 16:18.642
I'm scared.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.778
Right.

16:20.812 --> 16:22.997
Right. You deal with this all the time.

16:23.031 --> 16:26.316
I mean, just another patient,
right?

16:30.088 --> 16:32.623
My fiance's in a coma.

16:33.675 --> 16:34.825
What?

16:34.860 --> 16:37.178
He was in an accident.

16:37.212 --> 16:38.996
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

16:39.014 --> 16:40.531
I feel terrible.

16:40.565 --> 16:42.933
Yesterday he moved his hand,

16:42.968 --> 16:44.268
against the odds and the stats,

16:44.302 --> 16:46.620
against what everybody else
is saying is gonna happen.

16:46.655 --> 16:49.774
But he's getting better.

16:49.808 --> 16:51.642
Anyway, my whole point is

16:51.676 --> 16:53.644
the human body is an amazing thing,

16:53.678 --> 16:55.846
Mr. Munk, and we will find
out what's wrong with you

16:55.864 --> 16:57.948
and then we'll fix it, okay?

16:57.983 --> 16:59.150
Okay.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.728
Hey. Has Dr. Tolliver been in?

17:11.746 --> 17:14.265
You mean since the last time
you checked half an hour ago?

17:14.299 --> 17:15.866
Yes.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.251
No, she has not.

17:17.285 --> 17:20.253
Okay, listen, I know you're busy,

17:20.288 --> 17:21.255
but I've been doing these exercises...

17:21.289 --> 17:22.423
I'm not doing the bra.

17:22.457 --> 17:25.125
Do all the nurses know about the bra?

17:25.176 --> 17:26.710
Everyone knows about the bra.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.179
Jackson.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.181
Okay. All right, I'll do it.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.917
I'll get him to smell some deodorant,
tickle his feet.

17:33.935 --> 17:36.437
I am very secure in my masculinity.

17:36.471 --> 17:37.588
I know.

17:37.606 --> 17:38.806
Thank you.

17:38.857 --> 17:40.757
It's just this once.

17:48.483 --> 17:49.984
Nice office.

17:50.035 --> 17:52.069
Yeah, bigger than Charlie's.

17:52.103 --> 17:55.856
See? In a woman's world, size does matter.

17:55.891 --> 17:57.224
Mm.

17:57.259 --> 17:58.659
You wanted to see me?

17:58.693 --> 18:00.711
Yeah, uh, Johnny Wolfe...

18:00.745 --> 18:03.714
I'd like to schedule a
Van Ness rotationplasty.

18:04.587 --> 18:06.750
Van Ness? Patient's, what, 24 years old?

18:06.784 --> 18:08.385
Van Ness is done on children.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.603
Not always.

18:09.638 --> 18:11.121
Children with tumors.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.907
I know, but, Dana, with all due respect,

18:12.941 --> 18:15.576
at Sloan, I performed
several Van Ness rotations,

18:15.610 --> 18:17.645
quite successfully I might add.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.179
Why not just do a fusion?

18:19.231 --> 18:22.099
Because if I do a fusion,
then he's a peg leg forever.

18:22.133 --> 18:23.884
This guy's active, 24 years old.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.302
He's a laborer.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.820
Besides, with the amount of bone loss,

18:26.855 --> 18:28.138
his leg'll be that much shorter,

18:28.156 --> 18:29.806
and he's gonna require
a prosthetic anyway,

18:29.824 --> 18:33.160
so why not give him a leg
he can do something with?

18:33.194 --> 18:34.995
Because the risk of infection is too great

18:35.030 --> 18:36.764
and if it fails, the patient's looking

18:36.798 --> 18:38.749
at an above-the-knee amputation or worse.

18:38.783 --> 18:40.784
No. Too risky.

18:40.818 --> 18:42.002
You worried about litigation?

18:42.037 --> 18:43.337
Always.

18:43.371 --> 18:45.489
Well, my concern's for my patient.

18:47.509 --> 18:50.461
Your concern is for your reputation.

18:50.495 --> 18:52.296
You want to showboat, go somewhere else.

18:52.330 --> 18:54.498
Dana, look, I get it.

18:54.532 --> 18:56.250
This is your hospital now.

18:56.284 --> 18:58.602
You want to win respect?

18:58.637 --> 19:00.437
You gotta start taking some risks.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.691
So bet on your winners.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.143
My triumph is your glory.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.817
Don't grip the stick too tight.

19:13.851 --> 19:16.737
I'm having trouble working
the dial with one hand.

19:16.788 --> 19:19.856
It just takes practice.

19:19.874 --> 19:21.525
Shorten your grip about 20 centimeters,

19:21.543 --> 19:22.993
and then you can feed it in.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.380
Like ice fishing.

19:26.414 --> 19:28.248
Never been ice fishing.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.050
It's just something that boys make up

19:30.085 --> 19:32.202
- so they can drink in a shed.
- Ow!

19:32.220 --> 19:33.721
You're doing great, Mr. Munk.

19:33.755 --> 19:34.871
Whoa, Nelly.

19:34.889 --> 19:36.473
So...

19:36.508 --> 19:39.760
Dr. Goran... you guys dated?

19:39.811 --> 19:41.929
A long time ago, Maggie.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.547
Was he a bad boyfriend?

19:45.233 --> 19:46.400
He's just Joel.

19:46.434 --> 19:47.818
I, Benjamin...

19:47.852 --> 19:49.370
And why did it end between you two?

19:49.404 --> 19:52.022
Take thee, Karen Anne Churley...

19:52.056 --> 19:54.008
We're almost finished.
Just try and keep still.

19:54.042 --> 19:56.893
Oh, I love Karen Anne Churley.

19:56.911 --> 19:58.579
Yes, Mr. Munk, you keep telling us that.

19:58.613 --> 19:59.580
Ooh. Ow.

19:59.614 --> 20:00.998
Should we give him a propofol?

20:01.032 --> 20:03.200
No. If we perforate, we'd never know.

20:03.234 --> 20:05.135
Wow.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.670
Will you look at that?

20:06.705 --> 20:08.622
What? What is it?

20:08.657 --> 20:11.675
Mr. Munk, you have
a truly beautiful colon.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.893
I do?

20:12.927 --> 20:14.545
As flawless as the hope diamond.

20:14.579 --> 20:15.629
Congratulations.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.581
You mean I don't have cancer?

20:17.599 --> 20:19.867
I can marry Karen Anne Churley?

20:19.901 --> 20:21.719
Do you still hate hospitals?

20:25.089 --> 20:26.923
I'll be right back.

20:26.941 --> 20:28.275
Mm-hmm.

20:28.309 --> 20:31.395
I thought I'd better show you right away.

20:31.429 --> 20:33.897
Your patient Mr. Munk...

20:33.931 --> 20:35.932
strongly positive for occult blood.

20:35.950 --> 20:37.134
But his scope was clean.

20:37.168 --> 20:38.569
Exactly.

20:38.603 --> 20:40.120
So what the hell is
going on with this guy?

20:40.155 --> 20:41.722
It's a mystery.

20:41.756 --> 20:43.774
Yeah. Thanks, Fisher.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.526
Yeah.

21:05.096 --> 21:06.897
Hey. Do you know where Dr. Murphy is?

21:06.931 --> 21:08.232
I'm sorry?

21:08.266 --> 21:09.299
Gavin?

21:09.317 --> 21:10.567
I need a consult.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.470
You need a psych resident?

21:13.488 --> 21:14.922
I'm just asking you where he is.

21:14.956 --> 21:16.907
I don't mingle with the puppies.

21:16.941 --> 21:19.443
Not that one anyway.

21:19.477 --> 21:22.663
I'm having fun.

21:22.697 --> 21:26.116
What's fun for you isn't
always fun for everyone else.

21:28.253 --> 21:29.620
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:29.654 --> 21:32.656
Mm. Johnny Wolfe, your patient?
His wife wants to chat.

21:32.674 --> 21:34.341
But he told me he didn't have a wife.

21:34.375 --> 21:37.428
Oh, dude, I don't know.
He's got some kind of lady friend.

21:40.498 --> 21:44.101
Well, it's a hospital, right?
So bad things happen.

21:44.135 --> 21:46.136
People go into comas.

21:46.170 --> 21:47.838
People die.

21:47.856 --> 21:49.523
Code blue. B-306.

21:50.190 --> 21:51.525
Where's the crash team?

21:51.559 --> 21:53.527
Get in here! Move! Move!

21:53.561 --> 21:56.563
Here. Come on. I'll show you.

21:56.614 --> 21:58.849
We got a code blue. Let's go.

21:58.867 --> 22:00.183
See this guy just died?

22:00.201 --> 22:01.285
He's full code.

22:01.319 --> 22:03.203
Push 1 mil of epi.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.339
They keep trying,
but they won't bring him back.

22:05.373 --> 22:06.874
Charging 360.

22:06.908 --> 22:08.559
And we're gonna see him in a second.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.193
Clear.

22:11.412 --> 22:12.713
Oh, man.

22:12.747 --> 22:15.833
Nothing. Drop 300 mils of
amiodarone and 20 bicarb.

22:15.867 --> 22:17.200
Push more epi. Let's go.

22:17.218 --> 22:18.719
Can I do something?

22:18.753 --> 22:20.087
Bag him.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.339
Yeah, if you want.

22:22.373 --> 22:24.141
Come on. Just, uh,

22:24.175 --> 22:26.844
relax and give him the facts.

22:26.878 --> 22:28.979
- Help him through the fear.
- Okay. Clear.

22:32.667 --> 22:36.052
Aah!

22:36.070 --> 22:38.155
- Aah!
- Go get him. Go. Go.

22:38.189 --> 22:39.222
Aah!

22:39.240 --> 22:40.824
Don't panic. It's okay.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.025
You're just...

22:42.059 --> 22:43.410
You're dead, bro.

22:43.444 --> 22:46.497
Aah! Aah!

22:46.531 --> 22:47.998
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

22:52.537 --> 22:54.738
Where'd he go?

22:54.756 --> 22:57.007
He moved on.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.210
That's it?

23:00.244 --> 23:02.179
Ten seconds and poof, he's gone?

23:06.301 --> 23:07.935
Why won't that happen to me?

23:07.969 --> 23:09.603
I don't know. Maybe
something's keeping you here.

23:09.637 --> 23:11.138
Like you?

23:11.189 --> 23:13.089
I'm in a coma.

23:13.107 --> 23:14.725
So why haven't you come to?

23:14.759 --> 23:17.144
I mean...

23:17.195 --> 23:21.031
Is there something that you need
to do here before you wake up?

23:21.065 --> 23:23.734
That's another excellent question.

23:35.376 --> 23:37.928
Mrs. Wolfe?

23:37.979 --> 23:39.263
Yes?

23:39.314 --> 23:43.083
I'm sorry. He told me
that he wasn't married.

23:44.219 --> 23:47.421
Depends on what day you get him, I guess.

23:47.455 --> 23:49.490
We'd been fighting.

23:51.225 --> 23:52.910
Is Johnny gonna make it?

23:52.944 --> 23:55.095
This is a major surgery.

23:55.130 --> 23:57.831
You know, I'm gonna be
removing some of his leg,

23:57.866 --> 23:59.566
I'm gonna be reattaching his ankle,

23:59.584 --> 24:03.837
and frankly, complications
can arise in any procedure.

24:05.340 --> 24:07.374
I've been too scared to walk in there.

24:07.408 --> 24:11.462
But I need to make my peace with him,

24:11.513 --> 24:12.896
in case...

24:21.022 --> 24:23.107
Get her out of here.

24:27.195 --> 24:28.595
Johnny, look at me.

24:28.613 --> 24:31.632
You can't just shut me out.

24:31.666 --> 24:32.766
Leave.

24:32.784 --> 24:34.267
No.

24:34.285 --> 24:35.803
We need to talk.

24:35.837 --> 24:37.437
You need to let me explain.

24:37.455 --> 24:39.540
Explain?

24:39.574 --> 24:42.126
What can you tell me

24:42.160 --> 24:44.995
that Isaac hasn't already told me?

24:45.029 --> 24:48.715
I don't want to hear it.

24:48.750 --> 24:50.283
Go.

24:58.943 --> 25:01.578
Mr. Wolfe, we're gonna send
you down to the O.R. now.

25:11.806 --> 25:14.691
Hey, Dr. Reid. Who's your friend?

25:14.742 --> 25:16.810
This is Dr. Murphy. He's a psychiatrist.

25:16.828 --> 25:18.128
Hi.

25:19.581 --> 25:20.931
Could I see the backs of your knees?

25:20.965 --> 25:22.983
The pain's in my abdomen.

25:23.001 --> 25:24.701
Mm. Your knees, please.

25:24.736 --> 25:27.204
Uh...

25:27.255 --> 25:29.006
Be my guest.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.457
You already saw my colon.

25:30.491 --> 25:33.961
No point in getting shy now.

25:33.995 --> 25:35.379
Needle tracks.

25:35.430 --> 25:37.714
All right.

25:37.765 --> 25:40.333
I've been taking steroids. Uh, Karen...

25:40.351 --> 25:43.053
There's no Karen. Unless
you're marrying Karen Churley

25:43.104 --> 25:44.888
from the Hope-Zee cafeteria.

25:44.923 --> 25:46.523
She's employee of the month.
There's posters everywhere.

25:46.558 --> 25:48.325
You bled yourself to present as anemic

25:48.359 --> 25:49.610
and then you drank the blood

25:49.644 --> 25:51.228
so that it would show up in your stool.

25:51.262 --> 25:53.830
All right. Look, I...

25:53.865 --> 25:55.082
I'm crazy.

25:55.116 --> 25:56.700
You made up the girlfriend, the proposal.

25:56.734 --> 25:57.718
Dr. Reid?

25:57.752 --> 25:59.386
I want you out of this hospital

25:59.420 --> 26:00.904
the minute you get out of that bed.

26:00.955 --> 26:05.358
Before you go, Dr. Reid,
there's something I need to tell you.

26:06.611 --> 26:08.562
I swallowed a safety pin.

26:08.596 --> 26:11.048
An open one.

26:11.082 --> 26:12.082
What?

26:12.133 --> 26:14.134
I think I have a perforated bowel.

26:14.168 --> 26:16.369
I'm gonna need a C.T.

26:16.387 --> 26:17.754
You're lying.

26:17.789 --> 26:19.673
Uh, Dr. Reid?

26:19.707 --> 26:22.542
Um... I don't know that he is.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.378
He heard me talking earlier
about our swallower.

26:24.412 --> 26:26.847
He's a con man. He's conning us.

26:26.881 --> 26:28.599
I can't diagnose him off
a 5-minute interview,

26:28.650 --> 26:30.567
but even if he is, I...

26:30.602 --> 26:32.819
He's a frequent flier,
and they often self-harm.

26:35.707 --> 26:37.274
I don't believe this.

26:41.112 --> 26:43.113
Hey.

26:43.164 --> 26:45.282
You startled me.
Uh, where you coming from?

26:45.333 --> 26:48.285
Radiology. My patient claims
to have swallowed a safety pin.

26:48.336 --> 26:49.503
Ouch.

26:49.537 --> 26:51.371
Yeah, if it's true.

26:51.405 --> 26:54.741
Anyways, I'm waiting on a C.T.
Have you been in to see Charlie?

26:54.759 --> 26:57.928
My Parkinson's clinic went long.
I'm way behind, Alex.

26:57.962 --> 27:00.297
This coma arousal stuff is working.

27:00.348 --> 27:01.915
There's no evidence to prove that.

27:01.933 --> 27:04.751
No evidence? Are you kidding me? He moved.

27:04.769 --> 27:06.970
Alex, you know as well as I do...

27:07.021 --> 27:09.306
Just do me a favor and stop in.

27:09.357 --> 27:10.423
And do what?

27:10.441 --> 27:11.808
Give him another Glasgow test.

27:11.859 --> 27:13.644
Yesterday I did that.

27:13.695 --> 27:15.095
- Do another one.
- Alex...

27:15.113 --> 27:17.430
Shahir, do another one.
It'll take you five minutes.

27:19.984 --> 27:21.768
Okay. End of day.

27:21.786 --> 27:22.903
That's the best you can do?

27:22.937 --> 27:24.955
I do have other patients.

27:24.989 --> 27:26.073
Yeah, none of which are

27:26.107 --> 27:27.240
the chief of surgery at this hospital.

27:27.274 --> 27:28.959
- I'm immune to guilt.
- That wasn't guilt.

27:28.993 --> 27:30.610
It presented like guilt.

27:30.628 --> 27:34.948
He's progressing, Shahir.
Just give me a chance to prove it.

27:34.966 --> 27:36.750
Give him another test, okay?

27:39.721 --> 27:40.721
Thank you.

27:51.432 --> 27:53.817
Turns out a safety pin isn't so safe.

27:53.851 --> 27:56.269
Perforated his duodenum.

27:56.303 --> 27:58.939
Van Ness rotation. Very exciting.

27:58.973 --> 28:00.774
Whole hospital's talking about it.

28:00.808 --> 28:04.477
You don't look excited.

28:04.495 --> 28:06.246
Well, I convinced Kinney to let me do it

28:06.280 --> 28:07.864
and now I have to do it.

28:07.915 --> 28:12.119
That's usually how it works, doctor.

28:12.153 --> 28:14.788
Yeah, this kid's 24 years old.

28:14.822 --> 28:17.207
He's got his whole life ahead of him.

28:17.258 --> 28:19.176
I can't screw it up.

28:19.210 --> 28:21.762
You won't.

28:34.726 --> 28:36.843
Not used to performing to a full house.

28:36.861 --> 28:38.845
That's what you get for
doing diva surgeries.

28:38.863 --> 28:41.615
Should charge admission.

28:41.649 --> 28:43.283
Stage fright?

28:43.317 --> 28:44.534
For amateurs.

28:46.154 --> 28:48.155
All right. Insert the tourniquet.

28:48.189 --> 28:51.241
Tourniquet's up.

28:51.292 --> 28:52.492
Good.

28:54.295 --> 28:56.880
Okay.

28:56.914 --> 28:58.364
Here we go.

29:13.398 --> 29:16.933
Well, I think we know
why you're still here.

29:16.984 --> 29:18.735
Er and Onan, man.

29:18.770 --> 29:20.520
Sorry. What?

29:20.554 --> 29:22.406
You don't read the bible, doc?

29:22.440 --> 29:24.191
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

29:24.225 --> 29:26.410
That's a big...

29:26.444 --> 29:27.677
thick book.

29:27.712 --> 29:29.413
Well, so are those anatomy textbooks.

29:29.447 --> 29:32.849
Yes, but they have pictures,
lots and lots of pictures.

29:32.884 --> 29:35.786
It's a story from the old testament.

29:35.837 --> 29:37.921
Book genesis.

29:37.955 --> 29:39.239
Two brothers,

29:39.257 --> 29:41.925
Er and Onan...

29:41.959 --> 29:43.910
sons of Judah.

29:43.928 --> 29:46.630
God killed them for loving the same woman.

29:49.517 --> 29:52.385
So you told your brother you love his wife

29:52.419 --> 29:54.988
and you had a fight.

29:55.022 --> 29:56.723
30 feet up.

29:58.526 --> 30:00.093
My fault.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.381
All on me.

30:08.653 --> 30:09.953
Unfinished business.

30:09.987 --> 30:12.072
Unfinished business.

30:12.106 --> 30:15.575
That's... why you're still here.

30:17.245 --> 30:19.045
Fine.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.380
Fine.

30:23.617 --> 30:26.870
It's my fault. I know I messed up, okay?

30:29.390 --> 30:31.558
I know that.

30:35.513 --> 30:37.864
No. It's not gonna do it.

30:49.834 --> 30:52.019
He has Munchausen syndrome.

30:52.053 --> 30:54.521
He snowed me.

30:54.556 --> 30:56.557
He's seeking medical attention.

30:57.055 --> 30:58.442
And I gave it to him.

30:58.476 --> 31:00.094
He set the trap and I walked right in.

31:00.128 --> 31:02.362
Hospitals make him feel safe.

31:02.397 --> 31:04.965
Hospitals aren't meant to
make you feel anything.

31:04.999 --> 31:07.517
They're meant to get you better.

31:07.535 --> 31:09.403
It's not black and white like that.

31:09.454 --> 31:12.706
It is. You're either sick or you're not.

31:12.741 --> 31:13.874
Or it should be.

31:13.908 --> 31:15.859
He is sick, Alex.

31:15.877 --> 31:18.361
I should've seen it.

31:18.379 --> 31:21.364
He didn't even try to call his
"fiancee." Not once.

31:21.382 --> 31:22.382
You weren't looking for it.

31:22.417 --> 31:23.751
Well, I should've been.

31:23.802 --> 31:25.719
He's a smart guy.
I've only seen him for an hour,

31:25.754 --> 31:27.721
and there's probably other
mental health issues, too.

31:28.658 --> 31:29.923
He got what he wanted.

31:29.958 --> 31:31.208
He'll be here for a while.

31:31.226 --> 31:33.060
Yeah. And then he's gonna go

31:33.094 --> 31:34.377
and then he's gonna readmit himself

31:34.395 --> 31:36.096
and he's gonna readmit himself again.

31:36.147 --> 31:38.682
How do you treat patients like that?

31:38.716 --> 31:40.684
With patience.

31:40.718 --> 31:43.270
That's why they give me
the medium-size bucks.

31:45.106 --> 31:46.573
I'm gonna keep talking to him.

31:46.608 --> 31:47.775
Sure.

31:47.826 --> 31:51.745
Just not until after
my post-op rounds, okay?

31:51.780 --> 31:53.447
All right.

31:53.498 --> 31:54.948
Thanks.

32:01.622 --> 32:02.474
You paged me?

32:02.602 --> 32:03.757
Yeah, we should talk.

32:03.792 --> 32:04.758
Okay.

32:04.793 --> 32:06.710
Come on in. Sit down.

32:10.598 --> 32:12.916
So, uh, so Reycraft informs me

32:12.934 --> 32:14.751
you're looking to take some time of?

32:14.769 --> 32:16.570
He told you that?

32:16.604 --> 32:19.106
Oh, lots of people tell me
all kinds of things.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.808
You're stripping in the I.C.U.?

32:20.859 --> 32:22.109
Dana...

32:22.143 --> 32:24.061
You were slow to catch
this Munchausen thing.

32:24.095 --> 32:25.529
Nobody caught that.

32:25.563 --> 32:27.614
Sure. I just can't help but
wonder if two weeks ago

32:27.649 --> 32:29.716
you might've been a little
quicker off the mark.

32:29.751 --> 32:31.601
You're distracted.

32:31.619 --> 32:34.304
Doesn't seem to be any room
for anything but Charlie.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.541
That's not fair.

32:37.575 --> 32:41.061
No. What happened to Charlie isn't fair.

32:41.095 --> 32:42.612
But you're still a doctor.

32:44.299 --> 32:46.316
I need you here, Alex.

32:46.351 --> 32:47.334
Okay.

32:47.385 --> 32:49.336
I need you here, head in the game.

32:49.370 --> 32:51.438
Head in the game.

32:52.698 --> 32:53.660
Okay.

33:05.970 --> 33:08.522
Mr. Munk.

33:08.573 --> 33:09.639
Hey.

33:09.657 --> 33:12.976
Hey. How are you doing?

33:12.994 --> 33:15.863
Oh, a bit rough.

33:15.914 --> 33:18.565
Any nausea or vomiting?

33:18.600 --> 33:20.717
No.

33:20.752 --> 33:23.470
Can you rate your pain
on a scale of 1 to 10?

33:23.504 --> 33:26.406
Uh, about a 6, but, uh, I'm good.

33:26.441 --> 33:27.991
I'm-I'm okay.

33:29.177 --> 33:30.844
No, you're not.

33:30.879 --> 33:32.846
You're really not.

33:32.881 --> 33:35.015
You're a psychiatric
patient now, Mr. Munk.

33:35.049 --> 33:37.334
You don't need to live in denial anymore.

33:37.352 --> 33:40.237
You think I'm in denial?

33:40.271 --> 33:41.638
Yes.

33:41.673 --> 33:43.840
You won't even admit that...

33:43.858 --> 33:45.692
Well, then I'm not the only one.

33:47.845 --> 33:49.062
What?

33:49.097 --> 33:51.732
Your fiance.

33:51.783 --> 33:53.367
He's defying the odds,

33:53.401 --> 33:54.684
defying the medicine.

33:54.702 --> 33:58.589
He's gonna defy them
all and what, wake up?

33:58.623 --> 34:02.259
See...

34:02.293 --> 34:04.945
you keep believing the lie, too, Dr. Reid.

34:10.668 --> 34:12.869
He made it through.

34:12.887 --> 34:14.554
He did.

34:14.589 --> 34:18.708
Dr. Goran can be a knob,
but he's a great surgeon.

34:27.068 --> 34:28.252
Johnny?

34:41.516 --> 34:42.916
I know you hate me

34:42.951 --> 34:44.952
and you want me to go.

34:45.003 --> 34:47.920
I don't hate you.

34:50.692 --> 34:53.143
We don't have to talk about this now.

34:53.177 --> 34:54.795
No.

34:54.846 --> 34:57.247
I'm on a morphine drip.

34:57.265 --> 34:59.216
So it's probably the perfect time.

35:02.587 --> 35:05.272
I didn't want
to fall in love with him.

35:07.308 --> 35:09.609
But I couldn't deny how I was feeling,

35:09.644 --> 35:11.328
and I should've told you.

35:11.362 --> 35:14.064
You didn't think I could tell?

35:14.098 --> 35:16.233
If you knew, why didn't you say something?

35:16.267 --> 35:18.285
I didn't want to see it.

35:21.155 --> 35:25.959
You know, I, uh, thought if
I told myself something...

35:25.994 --> 35:28.962
enough times, then...

35:28.997 --> 35:31.865
well, I should've either
fought harder for you, Dalia,

35:31.899 --> 35:35.618
or I should've let you go, because...

35:37.455 --> 35:38.972
because Isaac died

35:39.007 --> 35:42.625
because I didn't...

35:42.643 --> 35:43.677
Don't.

35:43.728 --> 35:45.295
Because I couldn't...

35:45.330 --> 35:46.363
It's not true.

35:46.397 --> 35:48.098
It's my fault. It's all on me.

35:48.132 --> 35:49.182
Hey.

35:49.233 --> 35:51.568
Hey!

36:04.982 --> 36:07.501
Just stop it.

36:17.845 --> 36:20.047
Charlie?

36:20.098 --> 36:23.050
Charlie, can you open your eyes for me?

36:23.101 --> 36:24.667
Charlie?

36:41.319 --> 36:42.819
He's still a 6.

36:45.061 --> 36:45.855
He can't be.

36:45.873 --> 36:48.024
The numbers don't lie, Alex.
There's been no improvement.

36:48.042 --> 36:49.476
But he moved.

36:49.510 --> 36:51.211
The finger movement...
that was involuntary.

36:51.245 --> 36:53.530
That's a random firing of the neurons.

36:53.548 --> 36:55.532
It's a reflex. It means nothing.

36:56.443 --> 36:57.818
I'm sorry, Alex.

37:00.805 --> 37:02.172
Okay.

37:11.933 --> 37:13.600
Damn it.

37:16.070 --> 37:17.804
Hey, look, it's...

37:17.839 --> 37:20.407
it's gonna be okay, man.

37:20.441 --> 37:22.242
No.

37:22.276 --> 37:25.879
No, actually, it's not.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.144
Charlie?

37:58.696 --> 38:00.364
Mm.

38:00.382 --> 38:01.632
Oh.

38:03.034 --> 38:05.336
Mm.

38:07.389 --> 38:08.755
Screw it.

38:09.674 --> 38:11.392
Let's get married.

38:11.426 --> 38:12.676
Charlie.

38:12.710 --> 38:14.711
No, I'm serious.

38:14.729 --> 38:17.898
I'm serious. What are we waiting for?

38:17.933 --> 38:20.317
I don't know, maybe our second date?

38:23.155 --> 38:24.605
Okay.

38:27.108 --> 38:28.776
We're just gonna get married anyway.

38:28.827 --> 38:30.828
Mm. Is that so?

38:30.862 --> 38:31.862
That's so.

38:31.896 --> 38:34.031
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

38:34.065 --> 38:35.699
Blind faith.

38:37.752 --> 38:38.735
A feeling.

38:38.753 --> 38:41.038
It might just be gas.

38:43.925 --> 38:45.042
Oh.

38:45.076 --> 38:48.128
Ooh. No. No, it's not gas.

38:48.180 --> 38:50.214
You don't believe me?

38:50.248 --> 38:52.916
Charlie...

38:52.934 --> 38:56.570
this has been amazing.

38:56.605 --> 38:58.856
Best time of my life.

39:02.944 --> 39:06.597
But patience, my love.

39:06.615 --> 39:08.148
Pragmatist.

39:08.183 --> 39:10.067
Scientist.

39:11.236 --> 39:12.603
Well, I'd like you to meet...

39:14.873 --> 39:17.107
the optimist.

39:17.125 --> 39:19.043
Yin to your yang.

39:19.077 --> 39:20.160
I'll live with that.

39:20.212 --> 39:21.579
Okay.

39:21.613 --> 39:24.415
I'll live with anything
if you stick around.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.600
Mm.

39:32.257 --> 39:34.225
Oh.

39:34.259 --> 39:35.759
Oh.

39:37.729 --> 39:40.180
You okay?

39:40.232 --> 39:42.216
Yeah.

39:42.250 --> 39:44.101
No. I...

39:44.135 --> 39:45.135
I don't know.

39:47.606 --> 39:50.024
How could I get so emotional?

39:50.075 --> 39:51.742
Alex...

39:51.776 --> 39:54.978
I actually convinced myself
that he was getting better.

39:54.996 --> 39:56.830
Yeah, you had reason to. He moved.

39:56.865 --> 39:58.332
An involuntary reflex.

39:58.366 --> 40:01.252
You don't know that.

40:01.286 --> 40:04.421
I do know that.

40:04.456 --> 40:05.956
I'm a doctor.

40:05.991 --> 40:07.625
I am objective.

40:07.659 --> 40:10.294
I form conclusions based
on what is in front of me,

40:10.328 --> 40:14.098
what I can see and touch,

40:14.132 --> 40:16.517
- not on what I wish for...
- Alex...

40:16.551 --> 40:18.519
And what I'm hoping is true.

40:18.553 --> 40:21.555
You believe in him.

40:21.589 --> 40:23.390
You believe he's gonna get better.

40:23.425 --> 40:25.643
You're not his doctor.

40:25.677 --> 40:27.361
You're his lifeline,

40:27.395 --> 40:31.565
and right now you are all he's got.

40:31.616 --> 40:33.183
Right.

40:33.201 --> 40:35.486
So back on the horse...

40:37.038 --> 40:39.206
As they say on the ranch.

40:39.240 --> 40:41.041
You've never even been on a ranch.

40:43.864 --> 40:44.995
Thank you.

40:52.671 --> 40:54.254
To be seen...

40:56.841 --> 40:57.808
it's all we want...

40:59.644 --> 41:04.348
from the moment we take our first steps.

41:04.382 --> 41:05.882
"Look at me, mom."

41:07.385 --> 41:09.052
"Look at me, dad."

41:14.442 --> 41:16.160
Tell me I'm going to be okay.

41:19.764 --> 41:22.616
Tell me that someone cares about me.

41:24.836 --> 41:30.758
Tell me that we're in this together

41:30.792 --> 41:33.761
And that you're gonna get me through.

42:04.442 --> 42:06.126
Hey.

42:06.161 --> 42:07.378
You good?

42:07.412 --> 42:09.946
Yeah, I'm good.

42:09.964 --> 42:11.298
Good.

42:11.332 --> 42:13.751
So, uh,

42:13.785 --> 42:15.135
what now?

42:17.555 --> 42:19.256
I think I'm done, bro.

42:19.290 --> 42:21.141
What?

42:27.632 --> 42:31.485
I think this is it.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.034
Wow.
