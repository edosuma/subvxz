02:42.396 --> 02:43.896
<i>We're gonna write</i>

02:43.898 --> 02:45.797

03:04.585 --> 03:05.551
<i>I'm gonna get a [bleep]</i>

03:08.622 --> 03:10.856

<i>I'm hiring a guy named</i>

03:10.858 --> 03:12.591
<i>William McMasters.</i>

03:12.593 --> 03:13.692

<i>all right, I'll sit down</i>
<i>with you.</i>

03:14.995 --> 03:18.664
He sits down with Charles Ponzi
and Charles Ponzi goes,

03:18.666 --> 03:20.799
<i>I come from Italy.</i>
<i>I try to make-a money.</i>

03:20.801 --> 03:22.467
<i>They tell me</i>
<i>I can't make-a money here.</i>

03:22.469 --> 03:23.635
<i>And he's like, don't you</i>
<i>[bleep] worry about it.</i>

03:23.637 --> 03:27.339
<i>William McMasters is on</i>
<i>the [bleep] case now.</i>

03:27.341 --> 03:28.807
<i>So William McMasters goes to</i>

03:28.809 --> 03:30.509
<i>the [bleep] "Boston Post"</i>
<i>and goes,</i>

03:30.511 --> 03:31.877

<i>the real [bleep] deal.</i>

03:37.484 --> 03:40.886
The next day, "The Boston Post"
comes in to write an article

03:40.888 --> 03:41.687
about Ponzi.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.289
<i>And Ponzi charms the</i>
<i>pants off "The Boston Post".</i>

03:44.291 --> 03:46.925
<i>And they, in return,</i>
<i>write a very favorable article</i>

<i>about Ponzi and his, um,</i>
<i>Ponzi, um,</i>

03:51.298 --> 03:53.565

[laughs]

03:53.567 --> 03:55.467
- [laughs]
- I'm trying--

03:55.469 --> 03:57.569
Then--and--and--
and the next day,

03:57.571 --> 03:59.838
<i>there's a [bleep] line</i>

03:59.840 --> 04:01.340

<i>Charles Ponzi makes</i>

04:04.712 --> 04:06.878
<i>William McMasters sees that</i>

<i>hey, this looks</i>

04:08.515 --> 04:10.916
<i>So he decides to investigate</i>
<i>more as what's happening.</i>

04:10.918 --> 04:13.785
<i>So eventually, William</i>
<i>McMasters is going like,</i>

04:13.787 --> 04:14.920
<i>oh, [bleep].</i>

04:14.922 --> 04:16.622
<i>I think that the [bleep]</i>

04:16.624 --> 04:18.991
<i>This is all a scheme.</i>

04:18.993 --> 04:20.726
So he says to Charles Ponzi,

04:20.728 --> 04:22.728
<i>hey, I got a [bleep]</i>
<i>great idea.</i>

04:22.730 --> 04:24.062

04:27.601 --> 04:28.433

<i>because I think that</i>
<i>you're the [bleep] real deal.</i>

04:31.338 --> 04:32.371
<i>And I think</i>
<i>you should show them</i>

04:32.373 --> 04:35.607
<i>you're the real deal so they</i>
<i>can [bleep] leave you alone.</i>

04:35.609 --> 04:38.644
<i>And Ponzi's like, that's why</i>
<i>I hired you, McMasters.</i>

04:38.646 --> 04:39.878
<i>You're the [bleep] man.</i>

04:39.880 --> 04:43.382

04:43.384 --> 04:44.783
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

04:44.785 --> 04:46.485
<i>William McMasters only worked</i>

<i>for ten days,</i>
<i>and in those ten days,</i>

04:48.088 --> 04:53.025
he figured out that Ponzi
was a [bleep] scam artist.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.560
<i>The district attorney's</i>

04:55.562 --> 04:56.828

07:28.015 --> 07:29.648
- [chuckling]

07:29.650 --> 07:31.216
- Oh.

07:36.055 --> 07:37.389
<i>- This is Name That Song.</i>
<i>- 'Kay.</i>

07:37.391 --> 07:39.791
- It's exactly the right note,
by the way.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.828
- Oh, are you saying
you have perfect pitch,

07:42.830 --> 07:44.663
Derek Waters?
- Pretty much.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.998
- [scoffs]
- All right, ready?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.200
♪ Baby! ♪

07:48.202 --> 07:51.670
- ♪ Na-na na-na na-na,
kissed by a rose ♪

07:51.672 --> 07:53.905
- Whoa!

07:53.907 --> 07:54.539
How did you know that?

07:54.541 --> 07:58.210
- I'm extremely talented.

07:58.212 --> 07:59.945
[laughter]

07:59.947 --> 08:02.013
Hello,
I'm Hillary Anne Matthews.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.851
And today we're going to talk
about Sadie Farrell,

08:05.853 --> 08:08.954
AKA Sadie the Goat.

08:08.956 --> 08:09.521
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

08:09.523 --> 08:13.191
<i>So the year is 1860-ish.</i>

08:13.193 --> 08:16.361
<i>We're in Manhattan,</i>
<i>in the Lower East Side,</i>

08:16.363 --> 08:17.896
which is a grizzly locale.

08:17.898 --> 08:22.234
<i>So Sadie pitched</i>
<i>a male accomplice.</i>

08:22.236 --> 08:24.369
<i>And she was like,</i>

08:24.371 --> 08:27.105
<i>hey, dude, what if</i>

08:27.107 --> 08:28.707
<i>a guy comes out of a bar</i>

08:28.709 --> 08:32.010
<i>and I will run up to him</i>

08:32.012 --> 08:36.114
<i>and just head-butt him</i>
<i>in the stomach</i>

08:36.116 --> 08:37.983
<i>and disorient him?</i>

08:37.985 --> 08:39.251
<i>And he was like, cool.</i>

08:39.253 --> 08:40.819
<i>I will take a slingshot</i>

08:40.821 --> 08:43.722
<i>and from a distance,</i>
<i>knock him out.</i>

08:43.724 --> 08:46.992
And that's how she earned
the nickname "Sadie the Goat."

08:46.994 --> 08:49.961
Because news flash:
goats head-butt things.

08:49.963 --> 08:54.032
<i>And Sadie is just</i>
<i>running at them</i>

08:54.034 --> 08:56.334
<i>and head-butting them</i>
<i>in the stomach.</i>

08:56.336 --> 08:57.836
<i>Slingshot!</i>

08:57.838 --> 08:59.204
<i>[imitates popping]</i>

08:59.206 --> 09:00.138
<i>And they made a lot of money.</i>

09:00.140 --> 09:01.873
They--like a decent living.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.875
Like, it was like
an honorable living.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.177
You know, it wasn't like
a super fancy,

09:06.179 --> 09:07.112
really intense living.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.246
- Wait.
- It was like--

09:08.248 --> 09:09.481
- It wasn't fancy?

09:09.483 --> 09:11.283
- It wasn't fancy.
- The way they were living...

09:11.285 --> 09:12.751
- No.
- Off head-butting people?

09:12.753 --> 09:14.386
Okay.
- So...

09:14.388 --> 09:17.355
additionally, simultaneously,

09:17.357 --> 09:19.391
<i>there was a bar called</i>
<i>the Hole in the Wall.</i>

09:19.393 --> 09:23.728
<i>And there was a bouncer.</i>
<i>Her name was Gallus Mag.</i>

09:23.730 --> 09:26.431
<i>And Gallus Mag was</i>
<i>6-feet tall.</i>

09:26.433 --> 09:29.501
<i>And additionally,</i>
<i>she was a</i>

09:29.503 --> 09:33.305
badass bitch,
for real and for truly.

09:33.307 --> 09:37.075
<i>One day, our girl,</i>
<i>Sadie the Goat,</i>

09:37.077 --> 09:39.811
<i>comes into</i>
<i>the Hole in the Wall bar,</i>

09:39.813 --> 09:41.913
<i>and she, like,</i>
<i>encounters Gallus Mag.</i>

09:41.915 --> 09:44.182
<i>And here's the thing</i>
<i>about Gallus Mag:</i>

09:44.184 --> 09:44.916
<i>she was British.</i>

09:44.918 --> 09:46.918
<i>Here's the thing about</i>
<i>Sadie the Goat:</i>

09:46.920 --> 09:47.852
<i>she was Irish.</i>

09:47.854 --> 09:49.187
<i>Here's the thing</i>
<i>about that time period:</i>

09:49.189 --> 09:51.389
<i>white-on-white racism.</i>

09:51.391 --> 09:55.460
So Sadie the Goat, who was,
like, a very mouthy individual

09:55.462 --> 09:56.962
was like, umm,

09:56.964 --> 09:58.964
<i>the thing about British people</i>
<i>is that, like,</i>

09:58.966 --> 10:02.934
<i>they, like, are--</i>
<i>like, always like,</i>

10:02.936 --> 10:05.203
<i>"Ugh. Big Ben..."</i>
<i>- [chuckling]</i>

10:05.205 --> 10:08.340
<i>- "Is, like, a big clock."</i>

10:08.342 --> 10:09.407
<i>And Gallus Mag was like,</i>

10:09.409 --> 10:11.810
<i>please dial back</i>
<i>what you're saying.</i>

10:11.812 --> 10:13.845
<i>And Sadie the Goat</i>
<i>was just like,</i>

10:13.847 --> 10:17.215
<i>well, additionally,</i>
<i>beans on toast!</i>

10:17.217 --> 10:19.384
Gallus Mag was like,

10:19.386 --> 10:21.453
<i>you're being too crazy.</i>

10:21.455 --> 10:24.189
So she took Sadie the Goat
by the ear

10:24.191 --> 10:26.358
and she dragged her to the door.

10:26.360 --> 10:30.528
<i>And Sadie the Goat was like,</i>
<i>[squeals]</i>

10:30.530 --> 10:33.498
<i>[squealing]</i>

10:33.500 --> 10:36.935
[squealing]

10:36.937 --> 10:37.535
[laughs]

10:37.537 --> 10:39.371
- [chuckling]

10:39.373 --> 10:42.340
<i>- So Gallus Mag chomps off</i>

10:42.342 --> 10:45.243
<i>her mo-effing ear.</i>

10:45.245 --> 10:46.911
<i>And she puts it</i>
<i>into a jar of alcohol.</i>

10:46.913 --> 10:50.115
<i>And it was like such a great</i>
<i>trophy that she labels it,</i>

10:50.117 --> 10:52.450
"Sadie the Ears."
Nope.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.918
<i>"Sadie the Goat's Ear."</i>

10:53.920 --> 10:56.287
<i>And she put it</i>
<i>on her trophy case.</i>

10:56.289 --> 11:00.325
At this point,
Sadie the Goat is very em--

11:00.327 --> 11:01.292
embarrassed.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.261
<i>And she then witnesses</i>

11:03.263 --> 11:06.865
<i>this gang called</i>
<i>the Charlton Street Gang.</i>

11:06.867 --> 11:08.299
And they're trying
to commandeer

11:08.301 --> 11:10.101
<i>a small ship.</i>

11:10.103 --> 11:12.170
<i>But they're doing</i>
<i>a very, very bad job.</i>

11:12.172 --> 11:14.039
<i>So she's like,</i>
<i>you guys,</i>

11:14.041 --> 11:17.375
<i>you're doing</i>
<i>not a good job,</i>

11:17.377 --> 11:18.510
<i>and because of me,</i>

11:18.512 --> 11:21.246
<i>I can make you do</i>
<i>a very good job.</i>

11:21.248 --> 11:23.214
<i>And if you want</i>
<i>to work together,</i>

11:23.216 --> 11:24.883
<i>we can be more successful.</i>

11:24.885 --> 11:26.851
And they're like,
okay, listen.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.354
<i>Sadie the Goat,</i>
<i>if that is your real name,</i>

11:29.356 --> 11:30.021
<i>we--we're on board.</i>

11:30.023 --> 11:34.159
So they start cruising
up and down the Hudson.

11:34.161 --> 11:34.959
<i>And they are just, like,</i>

11:34.961 --> 11:38.897
<i>stealing things</i>
<i>and pillaging small towns.</i>

11:38.899 --> 11:41.533
<i>And she was like,</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

11:41.535 --> 11:45.270
<i>Obviously I need to start</i>
<i>kidnapping people hardcore.</i>

11:45.272 --> 11:47.205
So she's kidnapping people
and she's like,

11:47.207 --> 11:50.442
<i>I don't care if your</i>
<i>loved ones love you enough</i>

11:50.444 --> 11:52.343
<i>to pay your ransom.</i>
<i>Like,</i>

11:52.345 --> 11:55.447
<i>I am gonna make you</i>
<i>walk the plank right now.</i>

11:55.449 --> 11:59.017
<i>And he's like, no,</i>
<i>I'm so sorry I back-talked you.</i>

11:59.019 --> 12:02.320
And she was like,
I'm Sadie the Goat!

12:02.322 --> 12:03.254
And then she, like,

12:03.256 --> 12:05.090
<i>drops him off the plank</i>

12:05.092 --> 12:07.325
<i>and he splashes</i>
<i>into the river like...</i>

12:07.327 --> 12:10.895
[imitates splashing]

12:10.897 --> 12:11.996
- [laughs]

12:11.998 --> 12:13.631
- So they get the police
involved.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.667
And they lie in wait,
and they're like,

12:15.669 --> 12:19.037
<i>okay, we're gonna get</i>
<i>Sadie the Goat.</i>

12:19.039 --> 12:23.174
And when Sadie and
the gang members disembark,

12:23.176 --> 12:24.142
they ambushed them.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.010
<i>And they really did some damage</i>

12:26.012 --> 12:28.913
<i>'cause they were</i>
<i>shooting a lot of guns.</i>

12:28.915 --> 12:30.949
<i>And so Sadie and her gentlemen</i>

12:30.951 --> 12:34.919
<i>suffered enough casualties</i>
<i>that, at the end of it,</i>

12:34.921 --> 12:35.687
<i>Sadie was like,</i>

12:35.689 --> 12:39.491
<i>yo, I got to pack it in.</i>

12:39.493 --> 12:41.326
So Sadie the Goat

12:41.328 --> 12:43.027
<i>returns to the Fourth Ward.</i>

12:43.029 --> 12:46.297
<i>And she went to go</i>
<i>visit Gallus Mag.</i>

12:46.299 --> 12:48.366
And she was like, hi.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.336
<i>Listen, I know</i>
<i>I was, like, super crazy,</i>

12:51.338 --> 12:53.404
<i>and, like, I'm so sorry</i>
<i>for that.</i>

12:53.406 --> 12:54.706
<i>It was my bad.</i>

12:54.708 --> 12:56.641
And Gallus Mag is like,

12:56.643 --> 12:58.243
<i>I have something for you.</i>

12:58.245 --> 13:01.946
<i>And Sadie's like,</i>
<i>what could it be?</i>

13:01.948 --> 13:03.381
<i>And Gallus Mag presents her</i>

13:03.383 --> 13:06.050
<i>with Sadie's ear.</i>

13:06.052 --> 13:08.386
<i>[calm orchestral music]</i>

13:08.388 --> 13:09.454
<i>And Sadie the Goat is like,</i>

13:09.456 --> 13:13.258
<i>regardless of whatever</i>
<i>is between our legs,</i>

13:13.260 --> 13:14.726
<i>we are--mmm--</i>

13:14.728 --> 13:17.362
<i>really down to clown,</i>
<i>and, like, we are, like,</i>

13:17.364 --> 13:20.698
<i>really down to, like,</i>
<i>really tear shit up.</i>

13:20.700 --> 13:23.735
<i>And, like, I will</i>
<i>head-butt you in the stomach</i>

13:23.737 --> 13:24.669
<i>and I will chomp your ear off</i>

13:24.671 --> 13:27.105
<i>and, like,</i>
<i>thank you for being a friend.</i>

13:27.107 --> 13:30.475
That's how we got
the "Golden Girls" soundtrack

13:30.477 --> 13:33.278
song, Derek Waters.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.313
<i>♪ Thank you</i>

13:38.752 --> 13:40.185

13:40.187 --> 13:43.321
<i>Keep going.</i>
<i>- I--I don't know...</i>

13:43.323 --> 13:44.055
<i>- Yeah, neither do me.</i>

13:44.057 --> 13:47.458
<i>[cheesy upbeat music]</i>

13:47.460 --> 13:48.259
One baby carrot.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.662
Probably not what
Sadie the Goat used, but...

13:50.664 --> 13:54.098
- All right, wait.
What--what am I supposed to do?

13:54.100 --> 13:55.600
Oh, oh, how many en--

13:55.602 --> 13:58.136
oh!
[bleep]!

13:58.138 --> 13:59.704
[slow-motion ricochet]

13:59.706 --> 14:04.175
- Sadie the Goat!

14:04.177 --> 14:05.143
- Do you want that in here?
- Yeah.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.512
- Or do you want that separate?
- Yes, please.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.179
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.216
- This is nice.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.718
If you do all this, it's nice.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.787
And I have no problems with you.

14:15.789 --> 14:18.256
- [chuckles]

14:18.258 --> 14:20.391
- [laughs]

14:20.393 --> 14:21.359
Hello.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.496
I'm Rich Fulcher,
and today we're gonna talk about

14:25.498 --> 14:28.366
Lord Gordon-Gordon.

14:28.368 --> 14:32.237
<i>Lord Gordon-Gordon</i>
<i>was initially</i>

14:32.239 --> 14:34.572
<i>a guy named Hubert Hamilton.</i>

14:34.574 --> 14:38.543
<i>He was swindling</i>
<i>all these jewelers in London.</i>

14:38.545 --> 14:41.846
He stole about $100,000
from them.

14:41.848 --> 14:45.617
<i>And he's like,</i>
<i>come on, mother-sucker!</i>

14:45.619 --> 14:47.518
<i>He was not only a con man.</i>

14:47.520 --> 14:50.288
He took it to the next level.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.524
<i>Hubert Hamilton</i>
<i>moved to New York</i>

14:53.526 --> 14:56.661
<i>and changed his name</i>
<i>to Lord Gordon-Gordon.</i>

14:56.663 --> 14:59.898
Which is like, what?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.133
So his whole scam was

15:02.135 --> 15:04.802
<i>he's pretending that</i>
<i>he's Scottish royalty.</i>

15:04.804 --> 15:09.374
<i>He wore a kilt and that was</i>
<i>one of his big selling points.</i>

15:09.376 --> 15:12.310
<i>He's like, I'm wearing</i>
<i>a kilt, ya [bleep], ya.</i>

15:12.312 --> 15:16.180
<i>Oh, by the way</i>
<i>I'm a collateral relative</i>

15:16.182 --> 15:19.918
<i>of a Lord Byron and</i>
<i>cousin of the Campbells.</i>

15:19.920 --> 15:24.389
This guy is like
"Catch Me If You Can"

15:24.391 --> 15:26.624
meets "20/20".

15:26.626 --> 15:27.659
- I love that.

15:27.661 --> 15:30.194
I can't--I want
to know about that.

15:30.196 --> 15:31.863
- Lord Gord--

<i>who was an editor</i>
<i>of the "New York Tribune."</i>

15:40.340 --> 15:43.341
<i>And so Horace Greeley said,</i>
<i>hey, listen.</i>

15:43.343 --> 15:46.711
<i>My friend Jay Gould,</i>
<i>this guy--[hiccups]</i>

15:46.713 --> 15:50.782
<i>Guy is the top of the</i>

Jay Gould was

15:55.622 --> 15:57.455
<i>But--</i>

<i>So Horace--</i>

<i>[hiccups]</i>

16:03.063 --> 16:05.897
<i>Greeley comes to Jay Gould</i>

<i>He's, like, a real lord.</i>
<i>He--</i>

<i>Wears a kilt.</i>
