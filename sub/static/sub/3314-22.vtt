HAVING TWINS?

05:18.609 --> 05:20.780
I HAD NO IDEA MY LITTLE
TROOPS WERE THAT POWERFUL.

05:20.781 --> 05:22.532
YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU PICK THE DOCTOR?

05:22.533 --> 05:24.904
I WANTED A DOCTOR THAT WAS GONNA
TELL ME I HAD JUST ONE BABY.

05:24.905 --> 05:27.286
WELL, GOOD LUCK THERE.

05:27.287 --> 05:30.370

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:20.501 --> 06:21.591

06:21.592 --> 06:22.882
NO, NO, YES, NO.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.674
OOH, YES. HEY, I HEARD A "YES".

06:24.675 --> 06:25.965
THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START.

06:25.966 --> 06:28.428
JOE, I HAVE A CONFESSION:

06:28.429 --> 06:31.722
I AM SOMETIMES...
A LITTLE SELFISH.

06:33.564 --> 06:35.935
HONEY, THANK YOU FOR TRUSTING
ME ENOUGH TO SHARE THAT.

06:35.936 --> 06:38.478
I MEAN, LOOK, I DO WANT IT ALL.

06:38.479 --> 06:40.480
I WANT A BABY. I EVEN
WANT TWO BABIES.

06:40.481 --> 06:41.941
AND I WANT TO RUN FOR CONGRESS.

06:41.942 --> 06:44.654
I JUST DON'T WANT IT ALL

06:44.655 --> 06:47.697
YOU KNOW, IT'S-IT'S TERRIFYING.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.949
I NEED A GLASS OF WINE. I'M
DRINKING FOR THREE NOW!

06:49.950 --> 06:52.492
HEY, NO, NO, LISTEN
TO ME, NO MORE WINE.

06:52.493 --> 06:54.704
IN FACT, I'M GETTING RID OF
ALL THE WINE IN THIS HOUSE.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.706
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT, HAVEN'T YOU?

06:56.707 --> 06:59.338
HEY. COME ON, CALM DOWN.

06:59.339 --> 07:00.630
WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS.

07:00.631 --> 07:01.542
HOW? HOW?

07:01.543 --> 07:03.713
WITH ONE NEWBORN,
YOU GET NO SLEEP.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.424
WITH TWO, YOU GET TWICE
AS MUCH NO SLEEP!

07:05.425 --> 07:07.677
AND TWICE AS MUCH NO SEX.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.600
HONEY, I'M HERE FOR YOU.
IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.

07:10.601 --> 07:12.722
NO, NO, NO. I'M GONNA
SUCK AT DOING MY JOB,

07:12.723 --> 07:14.183
AND YOU'RE GONNA SUCK
AT DOING YOUR JOB.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.394
WE'LL BE DOUBLE SUCKERS

07:15.395 --> 07:17.057
WITH DOUBLE SUCKERS
HANGING OFF OF ME.

07:18.649 --> 07:21.320
HANK HAS YOUR CAMPAIGN
COMPLETELY UNDER CONTROL.

07:21.321 --> 07:23.322
AND BECAUSE NONE OF THE PUBLISHERS
I SENT MY BOOK TO WANT IT,

07:23.323 --> 07:25.565
I'M GONNA HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE
WORLD TO MANAGE THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

07:25.566 --> 07:27.236
SO ALL YOU NEED TO
WORRY ABOUT, HONEY,

07:27.237 --> 07:30.369
IS-IS-IS JUST MAKING
GREAT BABY CELLS

07:30.370 --> 07:32.912
AND BEING YOUR FANTASTIC,
ELECTABLE SELF, ALL RIGHT.

07:32.913 --> 07:35.916
SAY IT WITH ME: "I AM FANTASTIC
AND I AM ELECTABLE."

07:37.127 --> 07:39.669
I AM FANTASTIC AND
I AM ELECTABLE.

07:39.670 --> 07:41.671
YES, YOU ARE. ALL RIGHT,
YOU BELIEVE IT NOW?

07:41.672 --> 07:44.213
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS SO.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.676
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THAT WE CAN DO ALL THIS?

07:46.677 --> 07:49.589
YES, YES, I BELIEVE
IT A HUNDRED PERCENT!

07:49.590 --> 07:51.591
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT, CHECK THAT I
BELIEVE IT A THOUSAND PERCENT!

07:51.592 --> 07:54.094
ALL RIGHT, NOW JUST
GO UPSTAIRS AND REST.

07:55.095 --> 07:57.597
THANK YOU, JOE. YOU'RE MY ROCK.

07:57.598 --> 07:59.729
(chuckles) OF COURSE I AM.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.061
YOUR ROCK, YOU KNOW IT.

08:02.062 --> 08:05.565
YOUR... YOUR ROCK, BABY!

08:05.566 --> 08:08.659
YOUR BIG, LYING ROCK.

08:10.611 --> 08:12.573
OH, SCREW IT, I'M
DRINKING FOR FOUR NOW.

08:17.578 --> 08:20.290
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
CHEESE PUFFS?

08:21.922 --> 08:23.172
I JUST VACUUMED IN HERE.

08:23.173 --> 08:25.835
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY
RESPECT FOR WHAT I DO?

08:25.836 --> 08:27.127
(cell phone chimes)

08:28.679 --> 08:30.590
OH, CRAP. IT'S A REMINDER.

08:30.591 --> 08:32.762
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO FLETCHER
AND JOSIE'S WEDDING TOMORROW.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.894
WELL, ARE WE STILL GOING?

08:34.895 --> 08:36.596
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT?

08:36.597 --> 08:38.057
WELL, WE ALREADY RSVP'D,

08:38.058 --> 08:40.600
AND FRANKLY, I'M SCARED
OF MAKING JOSIE MAD.

08:40.601 --> 08:44.814
OOH, YEAH, IF SHE SEES TWO
EMPTY SEATS AT OUR TABLE...

08:44.815 --> 08:47.697
OH GOD, SHE'LL HUNT US DOWN

08:47.698 --> 08:49.740
AND GUT US WITH A CAKE CUTTER.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.995
YEAH. YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S JUST SAFER IF WE GO.

08:56.617 --> 08:57.707
TOGETHER?

08:57.708 --> 08:59.999
WELL, YEAH.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.162
WE CAN LISTEN TO YOUR MUSIC
IN THE CAR ON THE WAY THERE

09:03.163 --> 09:06.796
AND MY MUSIC ON THE WAY BACK.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.427
SEE?

09:08.428 --> 09:10.259
COMPROMISE.

09:10.260 --> 09:11.881
OH, GREAT.

09:11.882 --> 09:14.054
I CAN WEAR THAT VINTAGE
POWDER BLUE TUXEDO.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.767
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

09:17.768 --> 09:19.228
BUT WHAT ABOUT A COMPROMISE?

09:19.229 --> 09:21.230
TRUST ME,

09:21.231 --> 09:23.734
I'M SAVING YOU FROM YOURSELF.

09:30.450 --> 09:32.111
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP SO LATE?

09:32.112 --> 09:34.153
I CAN'T SLEEP.

09:34.154 --> 09:36.746
MEL'S NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHO BEEN, UM,

09:36.747 --> 09:39.329
STRESSING OUT ABOUT THIS
WHOLE TWIN SITUATION.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.833
HEY, HOW 'BOUT I MAKE YOU
A NICE FLUFFY OMELETTE?

09:43.834 --> 09:45.544
LEARNING TO KILL A
MAN WITH MY BIG TOE

09:45.545 --> 09:48.507
WAS NOT THE ONLY SKILL I
PICKED UP IN THE NAVY.

09:48.508 --> 09:50.549
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU CAN DO.

09:50.550 --> 09:52.591
WITH THE EGGS, NOT
WITH YOUR TOES.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.807
SO, TELL OLD RYDER
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU.

09:58.268 --> 10:00.770
(scoffs) I'M JUST WONDERING
IF MEL AND I HAVE

10:00.771 --> 10:02.722
BITTEN OFF A LITTLE
MORE THAN WE CAN CHEW.

10:02.723 --> 10:03.813
HAVING TWINS AND
RUNNING FOR CONGRESS?

10:03.814 --> 10:06.485
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S
KIND OF A CRAZY SITUATION.

10:06.486 --> 10:08.607
AND-AND-AND MEL WAS SORTA
GETTIN' ALL CRAZY ABOUT IT,

10:08.608 --> 10:09.859
AND I WAS TRYING
TO PLAY IT COOL,

10:09.860 --> 10:11.320
AND I SAID, "MEL, DON'T
WORRY, WE CAN DO THIS."

10:11.321 --> 10:13.362
AND AS THOSE WORDS WERE COMIN'
OUT OF MY MOUTH, I'M THINKING,

10:13.363 --> 10:15.284
I'M NOT SURE IF WE CAN DO THIS,
AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

10:15.285 --> 10:16.696
I'M STARTING TO FREAK
OUT A LITTLE BIT.

10:16.697 --> 10:19.578
HEY, PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER, MAN.

10:19.579 --> 10:20.950
WHEN YOU'RE UNDER
FIRE, THAT'S WHEN

10:20.951 --> 10:22.501
YOU'VE GOT TO DIG DEEP
AND TAKE CONTROL.

10:22.502 --> 10:24.204
AND RIGHT NOW YOU ARE IN
THE HEAT OF THE BATTLE.

10:25.746 --> 10:27.416
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
BEING IN A BATTLE?

10:27.417 --> 10:29.248
ARE YOU KIDDING? FIFTY
GUYS TRYING TO GET

10:29.249 --> 10:31.510
A HOT SHOWER IN THE MORNING
BEFORE THE WATER RUNS OUT?

10:31.511 --> 10:33.132
HEH, LET'S JUST SAY
I'VE DONE SOME THINGS

10:33.133 --> 10:34.755
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT WITH CIVILIANS.

10:36.016 --> 10:38.017
I DON'T KNOW, MAN, I THINK THIS
MIGHT BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

10:38.018 --> 10:41.430
HEY, SURE, LISTEN, YOU'RE
IN A SCARY SPOT RIGHT NOW,

10:41.431 --> 10:43.102
BUT I READ SOMEWHERE THAT

10:43.103 --> 10:46.566
"FEAR IS THE STARTER PISTOL
TO LIFE'S GREATEST MOMENTS."

10:47.768 --> 10:49.028
THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

10:49.029 --> 10:51.480
YEAH, IT SHOULD.
IT'S FROM YOUR BOOK.

10:51.481 --> 10:53.573
YOU LEFT THE MANUSCRIPT
IN THE BATHROOM.

10:55.575 --> 10:56.826
SO ULTIMATELY, WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS

10:56.827 --> 10:57.738
I SHOULD FOLLOW MY OWN ADVICE.

11:00.871 --> 11:02.332
I CAN'T SAY I'M WRONG.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.415
AND YOU HELPED OUT
A LITTLE, TOO.

11:07.457 --> 11:08.788
LOOK AT YOU, MAN,

11:08.789 --> 11:10.500
FINALLY STARTING TO
FIGURE THINGS OUT, HUH?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.753
MY GOD, MAN, HOW MANY
EGGS ARE YOU USING?

11:13.754 --> 11:15.424
OH, HA HA.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.136
YEAH, SO I'M USED TO
COOKING FOR FIFTY GUYS.

11:17.137 --> 11:19.468
IT'S OKAY. EGGS DON'T GO BAD.

11:19.469 --> 11:20.891
RIGHT?

11:24.975 --> 11:26.767
♪ ♪

11:29.519 --> 11:31.941
MEL, YOU HAVE TO GET TO
THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.773
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO HASN'T VOTED YET

11:33.774 --> 11:36.275
AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
IS VERY MAD AT YOU.

11:36.276 --> 11:38.908
- LISTEN.
- (crowd booing)

11:38.909 --> 11:40.239
- (closes door)
- DON'T BOO AT ME!

11:40.240 --> 11:41.450
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

11:41.451 --> 11:42.952
NOT BEFORE YOUR
LUNCH APPOINTMENT.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.084
- WHAT? WITH WHO?
- YOUR FAVORITE CONSTITUENTS.

11:45.085 --> 11:47.787
- (babies crying)
- AWW, MY BEAUTIFUL BABIES!

11:47.788 --> 11:49.378
JOE'S BRINGING IN THE REST.

11:49.379 --> 11:50.880
THE WHAT NOW?

11:50.881 --> 11:52.832
(babies crying)

11:52.833 --> 11:54.503
THOSE ARE ALL MINE?

11:54.504 --> 11:56.836
WELL, HONEY, THEY'RE
YOURS AND MINE.

11:56.837 --> 11:59.929
WELL, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO!
NO, NO, NO.

11:59.930 --> 12:02.011
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO NURSE GROUP A.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.012
NO, I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.804
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY NURSE
ALL THESE BABIES?

12:04.805 --> 12:06.476
EASY.

12:10.690 --> 12:12.731
(screams)

12:12.732 --> 12:14.233
MY JOB!

12:14.234 --> 12:16.356
WELL, TELL THE
PRESIDENT I'M SORRY.

12:18.318 --> 12:21.070
HEY. HEY, HONEY. HONEY.

12:21.071 --> 12:24.033
QUICK, JOE, HOW MANY
BOOBS DO I HAVE?

12:24.034 --> 12:26.285
YOU... YOU...

12:26.286 --> 12:28.287
YOU-YOU HAVE TWO, HONEY.

12:28.288 --> 12:30.629
- (gasps)
- TWO, TWO BEAUTIFUL BOOBS.

12:30.630 --> 12:32.671
AS PER USUAL.

12:32.672 --> 12:33.963
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:33.964 --> 12:35.214
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.

12:35.215 --> 12:37.466
I AM COMPLETELY SCARED.

12:37.467 --> 12:38.968
I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T GET

12:38.969 --> 12:40.339
BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN SCARED OF ANYTHING.

12:40.340 --> 12:41.881
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

12:41.882 --> 12:43.512
NO, THAT WHOLE "NO FEAR" THING

12:43.513 --> 12:44.844
I PUT ON, THAT'S JUST
A BUNCH OF BALONEY.

12:44.845 --> 12:46.095
I'M ACTUALLY TERRIFIED.

12:46.096 --> 12:49.939
WELL, IF YOU'RE SCARED
AND I'M SCARED,

12:49.940 --> 12:52.021
THEN WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

12:52.022 --> 12:54.523
BECAUSE THAT'S WHY WE
SHOULD DO IT, HONEY.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.945
LOOK, FEAR IS THE STARTER PISTOL

12:55.946 --> 12:57.356
FOR LIFE'S GREATEST MOMENTS.

12:57.357 --> 12:58.697
YOU KNOW, BANG!

12:58.698 --> 13:00.489
WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF
THAT GUN, ALL YOU NEED TO DO

13:00.490 --> 13:01.901
IS FOCUS ON THAT FINISH LINE.

13:01.902 --> 13:04.743
(sighs) JOE, YOU'RE SWEET,

13:04.744 --> 13:08.367
AND SMART AND SUPPORTIVE,
BUT THIS IS NUTS.

13:08.368 --> 13:11.500
YOU KNOW... AND IT'S NOT FAIR...

13:11.501 --> 13:13.502
TO YOU, OR TO ME,

13:13.503 --> 13:17.006
OR TO THE CONSTITUENTS
OR TO THESE BABIES...

13:17.007 --> 13:18.378
BUT MAINLY TO ME.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.883
LOOK, HONEY, WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO DO I'M GOING TO RESPECT IT.

13:23.884 --> 13:25.054
I-I THINK WE CAN DO IT,

13:25.055 --> 13:28.727
BUT THE DECISION IS UP TO YOU.

13:28.728 --> 13:30.389
(sighs)

13:30.390 --> 13:31.852
I CAN'T DO IT.

13:32.933 --> 13:34.644
I'M NOT GOING TO RUN.

13:36.606 --> 13:38.437
OKAY.

13:38.438 --> 13:42.242
IF THAT'S YOUR DECISION, THEN
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT'S BEST.

13:45.785 --> 13:48.117
(sighs)

13:48.118 --> 13:49.618
WANT ME TO COUNT
YOUR BOOBS AGAIN?

13:49.619 --> 13:51.211
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO
DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR MATH.

13:58.959 --> 14:01.010
I THINK MY FAVORITE
PART OF THE WEDDING

14:01.011 --> 14:02.461
WAS THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN.

14:02.462 --> 14:04.303
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BRIDE
STOOD TOO CLOSE TO IT

14:04.304 --> 14:05.724
- AND THE WIND PICKED UP.
- (chuckles)

14:05.725 --> 14:08.057
YOU KNOW, I JUST COULDN'T
GET OVER THE VOWS.

14:08.058 --> 14:10.469
"TILL DEATH DO US PART"?
WHAT IS THAT?

14:10.470 --> 14:12.641
THEY'RE ONLY TWENTY-TWO!

14:12.642 --> 14:14.063
I FREAKED OUT WHEN
THEY MADE ME SIGN

14:14.064 --> 14:16.025
A TWO-YEAR CONTRACT
FOR MY PHONE.

14:16.026 --> 14:17.606
YOU KNOW, JOSIE AND
FLETCHER HAVEN'T EVEN

14:17.607 --> 14:18.817
BEEN GOING OUT AS
LONG AS WE HAVE.

14:18.818 --> 14:20.109
I KNOW!

14:20.110 --> 14:22.111
IT'S CRAZY THAT THEY'RE MARRIED.

14:22.112 --> 14:25.034
HOW CAN THEY THINK ABOUT THAT
KIND OF COMMITMENT AT OUR AGE?

14:25.035 --> 14:28.077
RIGHT? THEY HAVE THEIR
WHOLE LIVES AHEAD OF THEM.

14:28.078 --> 14:29.618
EXACTLY.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.829
WATCH OUT! IT'S A DEER!

14:30.830 --> 14:31.871
(screams)

14:35.085 --> 14:36.495
OH, MY GOD.

14:36.496 --> 14:37.706
OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU OKAY?

14:37.707 --> 14:39.048
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

14:39.049 --> 14:40.089
I'M OKAY. ARE YOU OKAY?

14:40.090 --> 14:41.961
AH, YEAH, I'M OKAY.

14:41.962 --> 14:43.342
YEAH, I THINK I
MIGHT'VE PEED MY PANTS

14:43.343 --> 14:45.005
JUST A LITTLE BIT, BUT I'M OKAY.

14:46.806 --> 14:49.098
WE ALMOST KILLED THAT DEER.

14:49.099 --> 14:50.639
THAT DEER ALMOST KILLED US!

14:50.640 --> 14:52.221
YOU'RE RIGHT!

14:52.222 --> 14:54.894
- WE COULD HAVE DIED!
- YEAH.

14:56.146 --> 14:59.069
I AM SO GLAD I WASN'T WEARING
THAT POWDER BLUE TUXEDO.

15:00.070 --> 15:01.901
- AGAIN, THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

15:03.363 --> 15:05.284
I'M HERE TO ANNOUNCE THAT I'M
NOT RUNNING FOR CONGRESS.

15:05.285 --> 15:06.575
YOU COULDN'T TAKE
DOWN THE BIG SIGN?

15:06.576 --> 15:09.828
WELL, I WAS KINDA HOPING I
COULD CHANGE YOUR MIND.

15:09.829 --> 15:10.950
BUT I CAN'T.

15:10.951 --> 15:11.952
OR CAN I?

15:12.953 --> 15:14.994
I'M SORRY, HANK. I'M OUT.

15:14.995 --> 15:16.665
I RESPECT YOUR DECISION.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.497
I JUST HOPE A FEW
YEARS DOWN THE ROAD

15:18.498 --> 15:20.089
WE CAN TAKE ANOTHER
CRACK AT THIS.

15:20.090 --> 15:21.460
BUT DON'T WAIT TOO LONG.-

15:21.461 --> 15:24.544
TWINS LOSE THEIR P.R.
APPEAL AROUND AGE FIVE.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.928
MY GOD, WHEN WE HIT THAT SIGN,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.181
MY WHOLE LIFE FLASHED
IN FRONT OF MY EYES.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.143
MINE TOO.

15:33.144 --> 15:35.145
IT HAD THIS REALLY
EDGY HANDHELD LOOK.

15:36.646 --> 15:38.017
BUT THAT WAS SUCH A CLOSE CALL.

15:38.018 --> 15:40.109
IT MADE ME REALIZE,

15:40.110 --> 15:42.481
YOU KNOW, MY LIFE COULD
END AT ANY MOMENT,

15:42.482 --> 15:44.523
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE
MOST OF EVERYTHING,

15:44.524 --> 15:45.904
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE.

15:45.905 --> 15:48.117
YOU KNOW, I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

15:48.118 --> 15:49.408
LIFE'S TOO SHORT TO
BE FIGHTING OVER

15:49.409 --> 15:51.491
THESE PETTY "LIVING
TOGETHER" PROBLEMS.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.663
LENNOX...

15:54.664 --> 15:56.335
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

15:56.336 --> 15:57.876
I THINK SO.

15:57.877 --> 15:59.629
WE SHOULD GET MARRIED!

16:00.880 --> 16:02.342
WOW.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.136
I WAS GOING TO SAY WE SHOULD
JUST MOVE BACK IN TOGETHER,

16:07.137 --> 16:09.349
BUT I LIKE YOUR
IDEA SO MUCH MORE.

16:14.764 --> 16:17.596
HEY! ALL RIGHT, HONEY, SO LOOK,
I GOT WATER HERE FOR YOU.

16:17.597 --> 16:19.648
I GOT SOME CRACKERS IN CASE YOU
START TO FEEL A LITTLE SICK.

16:19.649 --> 16:21.150
AND RYDER HAS A TRASH CAN

16:21.151 --> 16:22.361
IN CASE YOU START
TO FEEL A LOT SICK.

16:22.362 --> 16:24.103
YEAH, JUST GIVE ME A SIGNAL
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HURL.

16:24.104 --> 16:25.364
OH, YOU'LL KNOW.

16:25.365 --> 16:28.317
AW, THANKS FOR TAKING SUCH
GOOD CARE OF ME, GUYS.

16:28.318 --> 16:30.160
HEY, I'M ALWAYS
HERE FOR YOU, BABY.

16:31.571 --> 16:33.492
(sighs, clears throat)

16:33.493 --> 16:35.494
(sighs)

16:35.495 --> 16:37.916
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I CAME HERE TODAY

16:37.917 --> 16:40.249
TO ANNOUNCE MY RUN FOR CONGRESS.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.332
BUT I LEARNED A FEW DAYS
AGO THAT I AM PREGNANT.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.294
UH, DOUBLE PREGNANT.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.386
- WITH TWINS, SO...
- (crowd murmuring)

16:47.387 --> 16:50.259
AND IT RAISED A LOT OF
BIG QUESTIONS LIKE,

16:50.260 --> 16:51.760
"WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?"

16:51.761 --> 16:52.931
"IS THIS INSANE?"

16:52.932 --> 16:55.304
AND "COULD THEY DOUBLE-CHECK
THAT ULTRASOUND

16:55.305 --> 16:57.016
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
MACHINES MAKE MISTAKES."

16:59.139 --> 17:01.980
ANYWAY, I HAD TO WEIGH
THE RESPONSIBILITIES

17:01.981 --> 17:05.023
OF A MOTHER OF TWINS
AND A CONGRESSWOMAN,

17:05.024 --> 17:08.317
AND CONSIDER IF I COULD
HANDLE IT ALL ON MY OWN.

17:08.318 --> 17:11.110
OF COURSE, I'M NOT
REALLY ON MY OWN.

17:11.111 --> 17:13.823
I HAVE MY HUSBAND, JOE, WHO
HAS ALWAYS GOT MY BACK.

17:15.455 --> 17:18.917
BUT TODAY, STANDING BEFORE
THE PEOPLE OF TOLEDO,

17:18.918 --> 17:22.502
I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO...

17:27.167 --> 17:29.839
I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO...

17:30.930 --> 17:32.431
I HAVE TO RUN FOR CONGRESS.

17:32.432 --> 17:35.474
(crowd murmuring)

17:35.475 --> 17:37.846
BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD ME FEAR

17:37.847 --> 17:39.938
IS LIKE A GUN

17:39.939 --> 17:41.390
THAT GOES OFF AT A RACE...

17:41.391 --> 17:42.981
WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

17:42.982 --> 17:45.444
IT IS GOOD, IT IS GOOD.
IT'S VERY GOOD, YES.

17:45.445 --> 17:47.106
HI. UM...

17:47.107 --> 17:49.188
YES, FEAR IS THE STARTER PISTOL

17:49.189 --> 17:50.899
FOR LIFE'S GREATEST
MOMENTS, ALL RIGHT.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.070
BANG!

17:52.071 --> 17:53.452
WHEN THAT GUN GOES OFF,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

17:53.453 --> 17:55.194
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS
FOCUS ON THE FINISH LINE.

17:55.195 --> 17:57.196
FOCUSING ON THE FINISH LINE
IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS...

17:57.197 --> 17:59.828
I GOT IT. I GOT IT, JOE.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.251
I KNOW YOU GOT IT.

18:04.254 --> 18:06.295
SO, MY FINISH LINE IS BEING

18:06.296 --> 18:09.258
THE BEST REPRESENTATIVE
TOLEDO COULD EVER HAVE.

18:09.259 --> 18:12.551
SO I'M RUNNING FOR CONGRESS.

18:12.552 --> 18:13.972
AND I'M GOING TO WIN!

18:13.973 --> 18:16.766
(cheering)

18:21.521 --> 18:25.023
OKAY, GUYS, SO MEL AND I
HAVE SOME EXCITING NEWS.

18:25.024 --> 18:27.276
IT WAS AWESOME. SO, WHAT
HAPPENED AT THE SPEECH, RIGHT...

18:27.277 --> 18:30.109
YO, YO, YO, YO! WILL YOU
LET MEL TELL 'EM, PLEASE?

18:31.321 --> 18:32.901
OKAY, SO EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE HAVING TWINS,

18:32.902 --> 18:35.194
I'VE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD
AND RUN FOR CONGRESS.

18:35.195 --> 18:36.655
HEY, THAT'S AWESOME!

18:36.656 --> 18:38.657
- TOLD YA!
- AH!

18:38.658 --> 18:40.739
AUNT MEL, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

18:40.740 --> 18:42.291
THANK YOU, LEN.

18:42.292 --> 18:43.742
I'M PROUD OF ME, TOO.

18:43.743 --> 18:46.295
WELL, YOU KNOW, LENNOX AND I HAVE
SOME NEWS THAT WE WANT TO SHARE, TOO.

18:46.296 --> 18:47.706
UH-HUH...

18:47.707 --> 18:50.209
SO, SINCE ZANDER
AND I DIDN'T DIE

18:50.210 --> 18:54.213
IN A CAR ACCIDENT
TODAY, WE DECIDED...

18:54.214 --> 18:55.555
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

19:00.970 --> 19:02.352
ARE YOU NUTS?

19:03.683 --> 19:05.604
JUST 'CAUSE YOU DON'T
DIE IN A CAR ACCIDENT

19:05.605 --> 19:06.765
DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET MARRIED!

19:06.766 --> 19:09.938
WHAT JOE MEANS IS,
THAT'S GREAT, GUYS!

19:09.939 --> 19:12.531
YOU KNOW, IT'S SO ROMANTIC
TO WANT TO GET MARRIED

19:12.532 --> 19:17.326
SO VERY, VERY, VERY,
VERY, VERY YOUNG.

19:17.327 --> 19:20.118
DON'T WORRY, AUNT MEL,
IT WON'T BE RIGHT AWAY.

19:20.119 --> 19:21.120
WHAT?

19:22.242 --> 19:23.583
I HAD MY HEART SET
ON A JUNE WEDDING.

19:24.954 --> 19:26.044
WELL, SINCE I GUESS

19:26.045 --> 19:27.246
WE'RE ALL SHARING
IMPORTANT NEWS,

19:27.247 --> 19:28.247
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO SHOW YOU GUYS.

19:28.248 --> 19:29.708
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

19:29.709 --> 19:31.169
I GOT MY ORDERS FROM THE NAVY.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.882
I'M GOING TO BE PROUDLY
SERVING MY COUNTRY IN...

19:33.883 --> 19:34.884
IT'S TOO FAR AWAY!

19:36.175 --> 19:37.756
AUNT MEL, HE HASN'T SAID
WHERE HE'S GOING YET.

19:37.757 --> 19:40.389
I KNOW, BUT IT'S
STILL TOO FAR AWAY!

19:40.390 --> 19:42.010
YEAH. WELL, I'M GOING
TO BE SHIPPING OUT

19:42.011 --> 19:45.394
TO SOMEWHERE CALLED
PORTSMOUTH, VIRGINIA!

19:45.395 --> 19:47.436
IT'S ACTUALLY
PRONOUNCED "PORTSM'TH."

19:47.437 --> 19:50.229
DON'T THINK SO, HA HA.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.361
IT'S SPELLED "PORTS-MOUTH."

19:52.362 --> 19:53.982
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
THE NAVY KNOWS HOW

19:53.983 --> 19:55.485
TO SPELL THEIR OWN CITIES, SO...

19:57.116 --> 19:58.487
CONGRATULATIONS, BUDDY.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.698
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT,

19:59.699 --> 20:01.280
IS THAT "PORTS-MOUTH"

20:01.281 --> 20:02.741
IS NEAR WASHINGTON D.C.,

20:02.742 --> 20:05.914
SO AFTER MEL WINS, YOU CAN
COME OVER FOR DINNER.

20:05.915 --> 20:07.417
OH, AT THE WHITE HOUSE?

20:10.710 --> 20:11.790
SURE.

20:11.791 --> 20:13.001
- YEAH.

20:13.002 --> 20:15.004
OH, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU, BABY.

20:16.336 --> 20:17.926
HOLY CRAP.

20:17.927 --> 20:20.429

20:20.430 --> 20:22.391
NO, THIS GUY FINALLY

20:22.392 --> 20:23.802
I'VE BEEN DYIN' FOR, SO...

20:23.803 --> 20:24.933
NO, THAT'S NOT YOUR RECIPE FACE.

20:24.934 --> 20:26.184
YES... WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU...
HON.

20:26.185 --> 20:27.225
(gasps)

20:27.226 --> 20:28.307
SOMEONE WANTS TO
PUBLISH YOUR BOOK!

20:28.308 --> 20:30.309
- THAT'S GREAT!
- Lennox: OH, MY GOD!

20:30.310 --> 20:31.810
WELL, YEAH, I KNOW, BUT
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

20:31.811 --> 20:33.482
- WHY NOT?
- WHY NOT?

20:33.483 --> 20:34.813
BECAUSE READ ON, HONEY,

20:34.814 --> 20:37.356
THEY ALSO WANT ME TO
DO A BIG BOOK TOUR.

20:37.357 --> 20:38.697
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

20:38.698 --> 20:40.279
NO, NO, IT'S NOT FAN...

20:40.280 --> 20:42.571
COME ON, WE CAN'T HAVE
TWINS, RUN FOR CONGRESS,

20:42.572 --> 20:44.703
AND A BOOK TOUR...
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

20:44.704 --> 20:46.785
ARE YOU KIDDING, JOE?

20:46.786 --> 20:48.867
THAT'S THE STARTER PISTOL.

20:48.868 --> 20:50.460
BANG.

20:53.793 --> 20:55.254
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT WE CAN DO IT?

20:56.426 --> 20:57.756
WE'LL HIRE A NANNY.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.378

20:59.379 --> 21:01.301
SOME HUNKY, GOOD LOOKING GUY.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.263
IT WORKED OUT FOR YOU BEFORE.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.307
HMM, JURY'S STILL OUT.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.101

21:13.102 --> 21:14.314
COME ON.
