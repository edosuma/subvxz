"Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt
were married

00:02.697 --> 00:05.198
"one year ago this week
at the Pawnee city hall.

00:05.233 --> 00:07.801
"The bride wore a gown made
by her friend Ann Perkins.

00:07.835 --> 00:10.937
"And the groom wore a butt so perfect
it could make an angel hang itself."

00:10.972 --> 00:13.272
- You wrote this, didn't you?
- I did.

00:13.273 --> 00:15.321
- They cut it way down.
- Thank God.

00:15.356 --> 00:18.233
Okay, so, the big day is tomorrow.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.956
So let's go over this again.
What are the anniversary rules?

00:20.991 --> 00:22.302
At lease 100 kisses.

00:22.336 --> 00:23.536
Dinner at 7:00.

00:23.571 --> 00:26.139
- And no gifts.
- That's right, no gifts.

00:26.173 --> 00:27.879
No gifts.

00:28.175 --> 00:29.876
No gifts.

00:29.910 --> 00:31.378
Oh, I'm getting him a gift.

00:31.412 --> 00:33.280
I always say that I'm not gonna
get him a gift.

00:33.314 --> 00:35.081
And Ben always believes me.

00:35.116 --> 00:36.716
And then, bam, I surprise him

00:36.751 --> 00:38.218
with the best gift of all time.

00:38.252 --> 00:41.888
He makes the cutest, dopiest
face when he's surprised.

00:41.923 --> 00:45.892
It's like... Wha-a-a-at?

00:45.926 --> 00:48.128
I'm not gonna make my stupid
surprise face this year

00:48.162 --> 00:50.964
because this time I got her
the most amazing gift ever.

00:50.998 --> 00:52.332
And she'll never see it coming

00:52.366 --> 00:54.835
because I'm giving it
to her today, one day early.

00:54.869 --> 00:56.703
So she's gonna make
the face this year.

00:56.737 --> 00:59.673
She will make that stupid face!

Additional support

comes from the Edgar C.

01:26.334 --> 01:29.803
and the Richard and Lois Wallenberg
Foundation Foundation...

01:29.837 --> 01:32.439
dedicated to the idea
that all human beings

01:32.473 --> 01:36.476
deserve a chance to hear about

01:36.510 --> 01:39.312
Welcome to
Thought For Your Thoughts.

01:39.347 --> 01:42.115
I'm your Pawneean host,
Derry Murbles.

01:42.149 --> 01:45.552
And I'm your Eagletonian host,
August Clementine.

01:45.586 --> 01:49.189
Yes, if you have not heard
our program in a while,

01:49.223 --> 01:51.725
Thought For Your Thoughts
now has a co-host,

01:51.759 --> 01:54.628
thanks to
the Pawnee-Eagleton merger

01:54.662 --> 01:57.330
I believe that is
the Eagleton-Pawnee merger,

01:57.365 --> 01:58.498
n'est-ce pas?

01:58.532 --> 02:01.134
I'd like to apologize to our listeners

02:01.168 --> 02:05.338
for my co-host's sudden
and violent outburst just now.

02:05.373 --> 02:09.776
Our guest is former city
councilwoman Leslie Knope.

02:09.810 --> 02:12.545
- Leslie, thought...
- For your thoughts.

02:12.580 --> 02:13.913
I said it.

02:13.948 --> 02:17.117
Absorb the aggression, Derry.

02:17.151 --> 02:19.419
Absorb the aggression.

02:19.453 --> 02:22.155
Well, I just want
to say thank you so much

02:22.189 --> 02:23.056
for having me.

02:23.090 --> 02:24.391
It's a thrill to be here.

02:24.425 --> 02:27.527
As a listener, I think
the merging of your two shows

02:27.561 --> 02:32.165
has really created such a big,
quiet, arcane ball of fun.

02:32.199 --> 02:34.434
It's been a couple of months
since Pawnee and Eagleton

02:34.468 --> 02:35.468
officially merged.

02:35.503 --> 02:38.405
Things are going... okay.

02:38.439 --> 02:41.341
There's still a little animosity
between the two towns.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.243
I haven't seen Pawneeans this mad

02:43.277 --> 02:47.047
since Frankie's discontinued
their pizza-stuffed-crust pizza.

02:47.081 --> 02:51.084
It was a pizza whose crust
was stuffed with little pizzas.

02:51.118 --> 02:53.353
And the crust of those little pizzas

02:53.387 --> 02:55.288
was made of chocolate.

02:55.323 --> 02:57.824
Ms. Knope, I understand
you're here today

02:57.858 --> 02:59.359
to try to convince us

02:59.393 --> 03:01.995
that this disastrous merger
of our two towns

03:02.029 --> 03:04.731
was, in any way, a good idea.

03:04.765 --> 03:06.967
Yes, there were some
bumps and bruises.

03:07.001 --> 03:09.703
And a brief rash of arson.

03:09.737 --> 03:13.406
And a rather large-scale brawl
at the dump.

03:13.441 --> 03:17.877
But overall, the state
of the merger is very strong.

03:17.912 --> 03:18.979
Scoff.

03:19.013 --> 03:21.381
Did you just say the word "scoff"?

03:21.415 --> 03:25.552
You must admit, Ms. Knope,
that the merging of the towns

03:25.586 --> 03:27.487
has been fraught with antipathy.

03:27.521 --> 03:30.590
For example, I now have
to share my studio

03:30.625 --> 03:34.728
with a fatuous twerp
who shall remain nameless.

03:34.762 --> 03:36.129
This twerp has a name.

03:36.163 --> 03:39.966
And it's August N'gutu
Liebowitz-Clementine.

03:40.001 --> 03:41.768
Guys...

03:41.802 --> 03:43.236
Hello.

03:43.271 --> 03:45.071
Thank you so much

03:45.106 --> 03:46.940
for letting me help plan
your anniversary.

03:46.974 --> 03:49.609
It is so wonderful to be part
of such a special day.

03:49.644 --> 03:51.745
Okay, remember,
under no circumstances

03:51.779 --> 03:53.480
can Leslie know
about what's going on.

03:53.514 --> 03:56.016
She has to make that face,
do you understand?

03:56.050 --> 03:58.151
No, I don't fully,
but my lips are sealed.

03:58.185 --> 03:59.853
I asked for Larry's help
because he has

03:59.887 --> 04:01.721
the most successful marriage
of anyone I know,

04:01.756 --> 04:03.890
to a gorgeous woman.

04:03.924 --> 04:06.893
Which, honestly,
is still a mystery to me.

04:06.928 --> 04:10.230
Like, was it a hypnosis
accident or something,

04:10.264 --> 04:11.464
where they put Gayle under

04:11.499 --> 04:13.667
and made her fall in love with Larry

04:13.701 --> 04:15.635
and never said the magic word
to snap her out of it?

04:15.670 --> 04:17.704
Like, if I say "nutmeg,"

04:17.738 --> 04:20.307
will she wake up and start screaming?

04:20.341 --> 04:22.776
What kind of pet are you
interested in adopting?

04:22.810 --> 04:24.911
We have dogs, cats, rabbits.

04:24.946 --> 04:27.747
Um, I work here, so, legally,
you can adopt me.

04:27.782 --> 04:30.150
The girls want an actual dog.

04:30.184 --> 04:32.452
And they want it to look like this.

04:32.486 --> 04:33.486
Interesting.

04:33.487 --> 04:36.723
So, like a banana made of spiders?

04:36.757 --> 04:38.692
I've said it before
and I'll say it again,

04:38.726 --> 04:40.994
children are terrible artists.

04:41.028 --> 04:43.363
And artists are crooks.

04:43.397 --> 04:45.098
I think I know a good dog.

04:45.132 --> 04:47.300
There he is!

04:47.335 --> 04:49.536
Ron, how about this guy?

04:49.570 --> 04:52.038
Yes, he is a handsome fellow.

04:52.073 --> 04:53.406
Hello, dog.

04:53.441 --> 04:54.841
I'll take him.

04:54.876 --> 04:56.910
That was easy. Awesome.

04:56.944 --> 05:00.180
Well, Donna can help you
get started on the paperwork.

05:00.214 --> 05:02.282
Donna?

05:02.316 --> 05:05.185
"Why lie? I'm shopping.
Back in an hour."

05:05.219 --> 05:10.090
Ugh! God, she's always just
leaving and not telling me.

05:10.124 --> 05:12.092
Hello, caller. You have a comment?

05:12.126 --> 05:13.960
Yeah, ever since the merger,

05:13.995 --> 05:16.496
we've had a really bad trash problem.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.531
Well, yes, there has been
some confusion

05:18.566 --> 05:19.966
with some of the garbage routes.

05:20.001 --> 05:22.502
And the Sanitation Department
is stretched a little thin.

05:22.536 --> 05:25.505
No, I mean Eagletonians
are human garbage.

05:25.539 --> 05:27.340
And we should throw them
in a dumpster.

05:27.375 --> 05:28.508
Kapow!

05:28.543 --> 05:30.744
Yeah, I really like the merger,

05:30.778 --> 05:33.279
but I hate that Eagleton
was forced to join Pawnee.

05:33.314 --> 05:35.181
Well, that's what the merger is.

05:35.216 --> 05:38.151
Oh. Yeah, then I hate the merger.

05:38.185 --> 05:40.253
I think the merger was great.

05:40.288 --> 05:43.857
And I think Leslie Knope
did an amazing job.

05:43.891 --> 05:46.092
I don't know who this is,
but I agree.

05:46.127 --> 05:47.394
- It's Andy!
- Hey.

05:47.428 --> 05:48.962
I'm on the radio!

05:48.996 --> 05:51.665
That's all the time we have on
Thought For Your Thoughts.

05:51.699 --> 05:54.868
- I'm Derry Murbles.
- And I'm August Clementine.

05:54.902 --> 05:58.171
And I talked last. Good day.

06:00.207 --> 06:02.008
Is this land mine still functional?

06:02.043 --> 06:05.078
Partially.

06:05.112 --> 06:06.313
Why?

06:06.347 --> 06:08.315
Because I want to blow up
Donna's desk

06:08.349 --> 06:10.060
so I can teach her
a lesson about what happens

06:10.095 --> 06:11.564
when you skip work.

06:11.599 --> 06:13.253
I'm not sure that's how
you should go about this.

06:13.287 --> 06:17.290
I'm kind of her boss, now,
but I still feel weird disciplining her.

06:17.291 --> 06:18.291
What do I do?

06:18.326 --> 06:21.795
Look her in the eyes and tell her
exactly what you need from her.

06:21.829 --> 06:25.532
Be mature, direct, and firm.

06:25.566 --> 06:28.502
What? Some fool
just slammed me on Yelp.

06:28.536 --> 06:29.903
I took Ron's advice.

06:29.937 --> 06:32.872
I very maturely and straightforwardly

06:32.907 --> 06:35.542
left anonymous comments
about Donna online.

06:35.576 --> 06:37.978
"Stopped by to adopt a dog,

06:38.012 --> 06:40.013
"but the employee, Donna Meagle,

06:40.047 --> 06:41.481
"was nowhere to be found.

06:41.515 --> 06:44.851
Thanks for nothing,
Donna Meagle. Booooo!"

06:44.885 --> 06:46.586
With five "O"s.

06:46.621 --> 06:48.054
Oh, my God, that sucks.

06:48.089 --> 06:50.390
Just have to work harder,
I guess, huh?

06:50.424 --> 06:53.460
This freak thinks he can hide
behind some anonymous user name?

06:53.494 --> 06:56.897
I'm about to hunt you down.

06:56.931 --> 06:59.633
Don't be upset, Leslie.
No one listens to the radio.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.901
I wasn't even listening.
I was listening to podcasts.

07:01.936 --> 07:03.436
Podcasts are great.
Radio is boring.

07:03.471 --> 07:05.438
Tom, this merger needs a win...

07:05.473 --> 07:07.707
something symbolic
and bright and happy

07:07.742 --> 07:09.876
that will show that there's
light at the end of the tunnel.

07:09.910 --> 07:11.378
God, I am so stressed.

07:11.412 --> 07:14.014
Uh, Leslie, may I borrow you
for a second?

07:14.048 --> 07:15.515
Something very special to show you.

07:15.549 --> 07:17.651
Now is not the time, Larry.
Please leave.

07:17.685 --> 07:19.819
- I think you...
- Larry! What are you still doing here?

07:19.854 --> 07:21.588
Aw, jeez. Okay.

07:21.622 --> 07:25.158
I just wish Pawnee and Eagleton
were as happy as Ben and me.

07:25.192 --> 07:26.960
Yeah, by the way,
I was gonna mention,

07:26.994 --> 07:28.595
you look really old in this picture.

07:28.629 --> 07:30.063
What?

07:30.097 --> 07:31.965
Andy, this is a picture of us.

07:31.999 --> 07:33.533
This is a picture of an elderly couple.

07:33.568 --> 07:34.668
Rosie and Doug DeMarco.

07:34.702 --> 07:36.136
They've been married for 50 years.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.538
"Rosie Hails from Pawnee,
while Doug is originally

07:38.572 --> 07:40.540
from the former Eagleton."

07:40.574 --> 07:42.442
Oh, my God, this is perfect.

07:42.476 --> 07:45.612
A Pawnee-Eagleton couple that
has been married for 50 years

07:45.646 --> 07:48.448
is a perfect symbol of how
our towns can get along.

07:48.482 --> 07:51.217
And we are gonna hold them up
as an example

07:51.252 --> 07:52.586
of Pawnee-Eagleton unity.

07:52.620 --> 07:55.522
Whoo! I'm getting
the epiphany sweats.

07:57.957 --> 08:00.150
Stop where you are
and take off your clothes.

08:00.153 --> 08:03.587
It's couples massage.
Ugh. Where's Leslie?

08:03.622 --> 08:05.297
Oh, well, she seemed
kind of stressed out.

08:05.331 --> 08:06.791
And then she yelled at me,

08:06.826 --> 08:08.400
and she said she was
too busy to come.

08:08.435 --> 08:10.451
And since you had said
do not tell her the secret

08:10.486 --> 08:13.238
- under any circumstances...
- Aw, man.

08:13.273 --> 08:15.908
Well, that's a danger of doing
things a day early, I guess.

08:15.942 --> 08:17.509
Should I text her and try again?

08:17.544 --> 08:19.667
Why don't you just go ahead
and get your massage,

08:19.702 --> 08:21.850
and then hopefully we can
get her in for the next thing.

08:21.885 --> 08:23.515
Okay. I have been
kind of tense lately.

08:23.550 --> 08:26.285
Just thinking about
the new Star Wars sequel.

08:26.319 --> 08:28.687
I'm afraid they're gonna
rely too heavily on CGI.

08:28.721 --> 08:31.390
And I'm carrying it all
in my shoulders.

08:31.424 --> 08:33.491
Just you? You paid for a couple.

08:33.525 --> 08:37.328
Well, can't believe
I'm saying this, but, uh...

08:37.663 --> 08:41.166
Larry, would you like to get
a couples massage with me?

08:41.200 --> 08:42.801
I would love to.

08:42.835 --> 08:44.736
Are we sure we should do this?

08:44.771 --> 08:47.005
Last time we scared an old person,
Larry had a heart attack.

08:47.039 --> 08:49.674
That was awesome.
He farted so much.

08:49.709 --> 08:51.469
Okay, look, obviously,
we don't really know

08:51.477 --> 08:53.945
these people, so let's
keep things fun and positive

08:53.980 --> 08:55.781
and celebratory, and merger-y.

08:57.316 --> 08:59.951
Can I help you?

08:59.986 --> 09:01.386
Hello, Mrs. DeMarco,
I am Leslie Knope,

09:01.421 --> 09:03.355
and we saw your announcement
in the newspaper

09:03.389 --> 09:05.624
and we would love to treat
you and your husband

09:05.658 --> 09:07.893
to a very special day.

09:07.927 --> 09:10.195
All right.
How much money did we win?

09:10.229 --> 09:13.465
Oh, no, you didn't win any money,
you won something better than money.

09:13.499 --> 09:15.500
A golden anniversary celebration.

09:15.535 --> 09:17.469
So no money.

09:17.503 --> 09:22.140
No, and I'm now just realizing
how misleading this giant check it.

09:22.175 --> 09:23.141
- Told you.
- Yes, you did, Tom.

09:23.176 --> 09:26.144
Thank you. Now is not the time.
We... Hey! Hey!

09:26.179 --> 09:27.846
We'll give you some money.
Okay?

09:27.880 --> 09:29.114
Here, here's some money.
Everybody give 'em money.

09:29.148 --> 09:32.918
I got football cards,
and a travel mouthwash.

09:32.952 --> 09:35.120
Wow! That's great!

09:35.154 --> 09:36.955
Let's get started!

09:36.989 --> 09:38.924
Just give me
the IP address of the dude

09:38.958 --> 09:40.959
that gave me
that cracked-out Yelp review.

09:40.993 --> 09:42.594
Okay, here we go.

09:42.628 --> 09:45.931
The IP address says it came from
someone inside city hall.

09:45.965 --> 09:48.533
In this building? Oh, hell, no.

09:48.568 --> 09:50.335
Well, who cares, really?

09:50.369 --> 09:52.137
It's just some dumb
internet person. Ignore it.

09:52.171 --> 09:53.739
Ignore it?

09:53.773 --> 09:56.608
I'm about to come down on this
dude like Thor's hammer Mjolnir.

09:56.642 --> 10:00.979
I'm about to go Mjolnir
on his ass!

10:01.013 --> 10:03.815
Speaking of bad reviews...

10:03.850 --> 10:06.384
Computers are mostly pointless,
but that Yelp thing

10:06.419 --> 10:10.088
gave me a great idea on how to
criticize people and places.

10:10.123 --> 10:13.542
I am composing strongly-worded letters

10:13.577 --> 10:16.495
about things I disapprove of,
and I am using the internet

10:16.529 --> 10:19.297
to get addresses
where I can send them.

10:19.332 --> 10:21.767
So far I've written
to a vegetable farm,

10:21.801 --> 10:26.271
several European ambassadors,
a manufacturer of male cologne,

10:26.305 --> 10:29.841
and a nonfat frozen yogurt bar.

10:29.876 --> 10:33.812
"Dear frozen yogurt,
you are the celery of desserts.

10:33.846 --> 10:38.817
Be ice cream or be nothing.
Zero stars."

10:38.851 --> 10:42.421
Oh, I cannot wait for Leslie
to see this surprise.

10:42.455 --> 10:43.989
I am so prepared.

10:44.023 --> 10:46.958
I watched Enchanted three times
to get all the details right.

10:46.993 --> 10:50.729
And then another two times,
because that movie is amazing.

10:50.763 --> 10:52.330
Oh, it really is.

10:52.365 --> 10:54.800
- Hello?
- Oh, hey, Leslie.

10:54.834 --> 10:56.468
You want to go grab lunch together?

10:56.502 --> 10:59.671
- I'm out front. Super casual.
- I'm sorry, babe.

10:59.706 --> 11:02.507
I'm not even in my office.
I'm out saving the merger.

11:02.542 --> 11:04.076
Can it wait?

11:04.110 --> 11:06.912
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries.

11:06.946 --> 11:08.180
Okay, great.
I'll see you at dinner. I love you.

11:08.214 --> 11:10.415
Oh, boy.

11:10.450 --> 11:12.851
Well, it's not too late
to cancel the waffle buffet

11:12.885 --> 11:14.152
or the Hilary impersonator,

11:14.187 --> 11:16.321
but a lot of these deposits
were non-refundable.

11:16.356 --> 11:18.690
Hey, Larry.

11:18.725 --> 11:22.227
You up for a boys' day out
in a horse-drawn carriage?

11:22.261 --> 11:24.229
Sure. What the heck?

11:24.263 --> 11:26.832
Well, thus begins
our enchanted adventure.

11:27.967 --> 11:29.901
God, that movie really was amazing.

11:29.936 --> 11:32.037
And you know what doesn't
get enough credit in that movie?

11:32.071 --> 11:33.338
- The score.
- Music.

11:34.374 --> 11:35.374
Good sir,

11:35.375 --> 11:37.309
tally ho.

11:37.343 --> 11:38.944
God, that... from the movie!

11:38.978 --> 11:40.912
That is definitely from the movie.

11:40.947 --> 11:43.248
Okay, you two, head on up there.

11:43.282 --> 11:46.118
We are gonna recreate your
wedding photo from 50 years ago.

11:46.152 --> 11:49.087
Okay, let's relive that day.

11:49.122 --> 11:52.024
Only this time could we
shave her moustache?

11:52.058 --> 11:53.692
Oh, boy. I don't know.

11:53.726 --> 11:56.595
I'm kind of worried about
putting these two on live TV.

11:56.629 --> 11:58.263
They're sort of grumpy.

11:58.297 --> 12:00.699
Why are we wasting our time
with these old people anyway?

12:00.733 --> 12:02.300
They're like the old version of iTunes.

12:02.335 --> 12:04.202
We're like the new version
of iTunes, baby.

12:04.237 --> 12:06.938
We're gonna be here forever.

12:06.973 --> 12:09.374
Oh, my God.

12:09.409 --> 12:10.942
I'm gonna die someday.

12:10.977 --> 12:14.079
Well, let's just hope that deep down
these two still love each other.

12:14.113 --> 12:17.849
Hey, no touching.
This is not your birthday.

12:17.884 --> 12:21.520
Now, you see, the trick with paella
is to use just enough saffron

12:21.554 --> 12:23.322
- to complement the shellfish.
- Okay.

12:25.191 --> 12:27.426
- Oh, man, that is so good.
- Oh, yeah.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.061
Wow, isn't this exciting?

12:29.095 --> 12:30.662
In just a few minutes,

12:30.697 --> 12:33.632
you are going to be professing
your love on television.

12:33.666 --> 12:35.467
Could I have a glass of water
before we go on?

12:35.468 --> 12:36.601
Don't give him any water.

12:36.636 --> 12:38.136
He does this annoying thing
where every time

12:38.171 --> 12:40.372
he takes a drink of water
he goes, "Ah..."

12:40.406 --> 12:42.374
She does this annoying thing
where every time

12:42.408 --> 12:44.342
she takes a drink of water
she is an old nag.

12:44.377 --> 12:48.280
Ah, the playful banter
of a couple on the same team.

12:48.314 --> 12:50.082
That's what this is, right?

12:50.116 --> 12:52.417
All right, let's burn this candle.

12:52.452 --> 12:53.585
Joan, if we could just have a moment.

12:53.619 --> 12:55.320
We need to get ready.

12:55.355 --> 12:56.955
Oh, no, no. We gotta go.

12:56.989 --> 12:58.323
Yeah, the uppers are kicking in.

12:58.358 --> 13:00.025
Just took some ludes
to kind of smooth it out,

13:00.059 --> 13:01.426
so I'm right in that sweet spot.

13:01.461 --> 13:04.730
Got about 20 minutes before
I either get really tired

13:04.764 --> 13:08.500
or really horny, so let's roll.

13:08.534 --> 13:11.136
Dougie, are you sure
you want to go on television?

13:11.170 --> 13:13.638
You look like a leather glove
got caught in a lawnmower.

13:13.673 --> 13:16.108
Okay, you know what?
I'm going to admit something.

13:16.142 --> 13:18.577
I orchestrated
the Pawnee-Eagleton merger,

13:18.611 --> 13:22.347
and I was hoping that
your marriage could show people

13:22.382 --> 13:23.982
that a happy union is possible.

13:24.017 --> 13:26.218
So when you're out there,
if you could just, you know,

13:26.252 --> 13:29.087
look back over the past
50 years together

13:29.122 --> 13:32.824
and focus on the good times, okay?

13:32.859 --> 13:35.360
Donna, you wanted to see me?

13:35.395 --> 13:36.895
Yes, I did, troll.

13:36.929 --> 13:38.363
What?

13:38.398 --> 13:40.165
You tried to adopt a cat
last week and I turned you down,

13:40.199 --> 13:43.335
because I thought it was too sad
for you to have six cats.

13:43.369 --> 13:45.704
Then you tried to blow up
my spot online.

13:45.738 --> 13:47.239
You're fired.

13:47.273 --> 13:49.975
You're not my boss, I work
for the city attorney's office.

13:50.009 --> 13:52.944
You're fired.

13:54.380 --> 13:57.682
How much postage does it take
to send a letter to Canada?

13:57.717 --> 14:00.118
- Who's it going to?
- Canada.

14:00.153 --> 14:03.321
It says, "Dear Canada,
you."

14:03.356 --> 14:05.991
Doug and Rosie DeMarco,
50 years.

14:06.025 --> 14:07.025
Ahh.

14:07.026 --> 14:09.895
Tell us how you first met.

14:09.929 --> 14:12.064
Well, it was 1963,

14:12.098 --> 14:16.201
and we met, and it was great.

14:16.235 --> 14:18.136
Isn't love grand?

14:18.171 --> 14:22.707
50 years of marriage, helping
to bridge the meaningless divide

14:22.742 --> 14:24.509
between Pawnee and Eagleton.

14:24.544 --> 14:25.744
Yeah, my show, my questions.

14:25.778 --> 14:28.580
So what is the secret sauce
that we should all

14:28.614 --> 14:31.883
be putting on
our marriage burgers?

14:31.918 --> 14:33.552
Well, we never go to bed angry.

14:33.586 --> 14:34.853
Never, ever would have
thought of that.

14:34.887 --> 14:37.856
- Ahh.
- Okay.

14:37.890 --> 14:39.925
I can't do this.
Leslie, you can keep your money.

14:39.959 --> 14:42.394
M-money?

14:42.428 --> 14:44.062
Did you bribe them to be here?

14:44.097 --> 14:45.330
No, I...

14:45.365 --> 14:47.432
Leslie offered us each
200 bucks to keep this going...

14:47.467 --> 14:49.768
- Ah...
- But it's impossible.

14:49.802 --> 14:51.369
You want to know
why we got married?

14:51.404 --> 14:52.771
Bring it.

14:52.805 --> 14:55.407
I had no prospects, and Dougie
here had an alcohol problem.

14:55.441 --> 14:57.976
Plus the Cold War was happening,

14:58.011 --> 15:00.245
and frankly, we all thought
we were gonna die.

15:00.279 --> 15:02.714
Well, I figured I could
really tick off my parents

15:02.749 --> 15:05.817
by shacking up
with some Pawnee trash.

15:05.852 --> 15:07.285
Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta. Okay.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.888
We all agree that marriages
have their ups and downs,

15:09.922 --> 15:14.426
but at the end of the day,
they're worth it because...

15:14.460 --> 15:15.794
Who likes tap dancing?

15:17.130 --> 15:19.159
I slept with Sharon in 1979.

15:19.194 --> 15:22.567
I used to get out of the shower
in front of your brother on purpose.

15:24.745 --> 15:27.413
Hey, Leslie, who cares?
They're old people.

15:27.447 --> 15:29.849
They eat, they sleep, they complain,
and they watch Family Feud.

15:29.883 --> 15:31.217
Oh, my God,
I wanna be an old person.

15:31.251 --> 15:32.952
Gah, I don't know what to do.

15:32.986 --> 15:35.421
I wish Ben was here.
What is he doing right now?

15:37.000 --> 15:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:53.706 --> 15:55.574
Oh, man!

15:55.608 --> 15:57.142
- You did good!
- Larry!

15:57.177 --> 15:59.511
Whoa! Wow. Thank you.

16:01.447 --> 16:03.011
Can I help you?

16:03.046 --> 16:06.518
Yeah, I own Lettuce Eat,
the vegan restaurant on Lowell Drive,

16:06.553 --> 16:09.121
and I wanted to know
why you nailed this letter to my door.

16:09.155 --> 16:11.290
"Veganism is the sad result

16:11.324 --> 16:13.025
"of a morally corrupt mind.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.961
Reconsider your life."

16:15.995 --> 16:18.497
Because I believe it. Good day.

16:18.531 --> 16:22.367
Carnivores. You're all the same.

16:22.402 --> 16:24.303
How did that guy
know where to find you?

16:24.337 --> 16:26.104
I assume he saw
my name and address

16:26.139 --> 16:28.507
at the bottom of the letter
I nailed to his door.

16:28.541 --> 16:30.876
- You signed your real name?
- Of course I did.

16:30.910 --> 16:32.010
What's gonna happen?

16:32.045 --> 16:34.079
A vegan is gonna physically
attack me?

16:34.113 --> 16:36.715
They're basically made of glass.

16:36.749 --> 16:38.884
But more importantly,
if you believe in something,

16:38.918 --> 16:40.452
you sign your name to it.

16:40.486 --> 16:43.188
Which is why the makers
of carbonated water

16:43.223 --> 16:46.058
will soon know exactly
where to find me.

16:48.094 --> 16:51.830
Donna, Kyle did not
write those things, okay?

16:51.865 --> 16:53.298
I did.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.534
- I know.
- You do?

16:55.568 --> 16:57.002
I checked what else
that user had written.

16:57.036 --> 16:58.971
It was a review
of a funeral home that said

16:59.005 --> 17:00.505
"Great first date spot."

17:00.540 --> 17:02.541
I dragged Kyle in here to see
if you would come clean.

17:02.575 --> 17:04.108
Well, you overestimated

17:04.143 --> 17:06.411
how much I care
what happens to Kyle.

17:06.445 --> 17:08.547
Or anyone, really.

17:08.580 --> 17:12.151
But... I'm sorry that I didn't
just talk to you.

17:12.185 --> 17:13.425
And I'm sorry I bailed on work.

17:13.453 --> 17:16.387
And I'm sorry I toyed with you
instead of coming at you straight.

17:16.422 --> 17:18.957
From now on,
we say what we feel.

17:18.992 --> 17:20.826
- Cool?
- Cool.

17:20.859 --> 17:22.493
Your lipstick looks weird.

17:22.528 --> 17:24.029
You're gonna want to
shut your mouth right now.

17:24.063 --> 17:25.931
Good talk.

17:25.964 --> 17:27.531
I don't know.

17:27.567 --> 17:30.936
Maybe Pawneeans and Eagletonians
aren't meant to coexist.

17:30.970 --> 17:32.738
Well, at least our merger
is going well.

17:32.772 --> 17:35.974
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:36.009 --> 17:37.809
You know, Andy and Tom were right

17:37.844 --> 17:39.445
when they said
the DeMarcos don't matter.

17:39.479 --> 17:41.113
Their generation's the past.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.614
The way to make
this merger take hold

17:42.649 --> 17:44.683
is to focus on the future.

17:44.717 --> 17:46.551
Of course.

17:46.586 --> 17:49.721
The children.
The children are our future.

17:49.756 --> 17:51.290
Whitney Houston knew it,

17:51.324 --> 17:52.758
and so do you, and so do I.

17:52.792 --> 17:54.126
I'm gonna need your help
on something.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.627
- I think we should go to work...
- Oh.

17:55.662 --> 17:58.096
But not now. We're having dinner.

17:58.131 --> 18:01.233
Damn, this paella is good.
Did you put saffron in here?

18:01.267 --> 18:04.102
It makes the shellfish
taste delicious.

18:04.137 --> 18:07.706
Yes. Yes, it does.

18:07.740 --> 18:09.741
Okay, the people in this room

18:09.776 --> 18:12.744
are the first members of the
Pawnee-Eagleton Youth Committee.

18:12.779 --> 18:14.846
Now, April says that young people

18:14.881 --> 18:16.281
think the word "committee" is lame,

18:16.316 --> 18:18.817
so let's just think of this
as a like a super chill,

18:18.851 --> 18:20.152
fun e-hangout.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.120
Worse. That's worse.

18:22.155 --> 18:23.789
Okay, new people.
Let's introduce ourselves.

18:23.823 --> 18:25.123
Craig Middlebrooks.

18:25.158 --> 18:27.259
Samantha in the boardroom,
Miranda in the bedroom.

18:27.293 --> 18:29.895
I know it's not ideal,
but it's who I am.

18:29.929 --> 18:32.664
This is my friend Madison.
She's amazing.

18:32.699 --> 18:34.566
And she drove me here!

18:34.601 --> 18:35.868
Okay.

18:35.902 --> 18:38.770
This group has
an incredibly important job.

18:38.805 --> 18:42.174
You need to figure out how to
hold this town together.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.976
You are going to meet twice a week

18:44.010 --> 18:45.777
and you're here
because of your energy,

18:45.812 --> 18:47.846
and your youth, and for some
of you, your mental age,

18:47.880 --> 18:50.515
and you're going to find a way
to make this merger stick.

18:50.550 --> 18:52.484
So we are gonna order you
some 'zzas.

18:52.518 --> 18:55.320
You get to B.S.-ing,
brainstorming.

18:55.355 --> 18:57.834
Just chill. Peace out.

18:59.123 --> 19:00.790
Okay, so it's been an hour.

19:00.825 --> 19:02.158
From out there,
it looks like you guys

19:02.193 --> 19:03.527
were having some fun,
getting to know each other.

19:03.561 --> 19:05.481
So why don't we call
this first meeting a success

19:05.496 --> 19:07.163
and then we'll get together
later in the week.

19:07.198 --> 19:09.132
Hold up, sweet pea.
We have an idea.

19:09.167 --> 19:11.334
It's called the Unity Concert.

19:11.369 --> 19:14.804
It's a massive music and arts festival
to celebrate the merger.

19:14.839 --> 19:16.773
We get artists and musicians
from both towns

19:16.807 --> 19:17.941
to come together.

19:17.975 --> 19:19.276
It's gonna be like a giant Woodstock,

19:19.310 --> 19:21.178
except for instead of everybody
rolling around in mud,

19:21.212 --> 19:22.646
they'll be rolling around
in happiness.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.415
Or maybe mud. I don't know.
I can't control the weather.

19:25.449 --> 19:26.850
We want to have a bunch
of different band stages.

19:26.884 --> 19:28.818
You know, people will go
to parts of the town

19:28.853 --> 19:29.953
they don't usually go to.

19:29.987 --> 19:31.855
Plus, we'll have tents
for art exhibits

19:31.889 --> 19:33.857
and panels, and maybe
a short film festival.

19:33.891 --> 19:36.092
Donna said she might
be able to get Ginuwine.

19:36.127 --> 19:37.661
That's given me a reason to live.

19:37.695 --> 19:39.262
Yeah, it's not like
everyone's gonna suddenly

19:39.297 --> 19:41.231
start holding hands and making out,

19:41.265 --> 19:43.567
but we figure, why not
throw a big three-day

19:43.601 --> 19:46.002
outdoor party,
show everyone a good time,

19:46.037 --> 19:48.438
and maybe they'll forget
about this stupid stuff.

19:48.472 --> 19:49.873
What do you think?

19:49.907 --> 19:51.741
I don't... I don't...

19:51.776 --> 19:53.310
I don't even...
You know what I mean?

19:53.344 --> 19:56.012
What's wrong with her?
Why is making those noises?

19:57.315 --> 19:58.515
Oh, right, you don't know Leslie.

19:58.549 --> 20:02.185
That means she loves it so much
she can't speak.

20:02.220 --> 20:05.055
You guys, that's like...
I don't know... Amazing.

20:05.089 --> 20:07.090
Like... what you do there.

20:07.124 --> 20:08.792
Happy anniversary.

20:08.826 --> 20:10.126
So I know we agreed on no gifts.

20:10.161 --> 20:11.962
- What?
- But I did get you a gift.

20:11.996 --> 20:13.230
- No.
- A bunch of them, actually.

20:13.264 --> 20:15.031
I was gonna surprise you
with them yesterday,

20:15.066 --> 20:17.868
but they never reached you.

20:17.902 --> 20:19.369
Ahem.

20:19.403 --> 20:23.773
Oh, my eff-ing God.

20:23.808 --> 20:25.742
You planned all of this for me?

20:25.776 --> 20:27.577
An enchanted carriage?

20:27.612 --> 20:29.212
This is amazing.

20:29.247 --> 20:32.315
Oh, and your scrapbook
instincts are really good.

20:32.350 --> 20:33.783
I mean, this is a little rough,

20:33.818 --> 20:35.318
but you have a lot of talent here.

20:35.353 --> 20:36.686
Oh, I can't believe

20:36.721 --> 20:38.588
I actually defeated Leslie Knope
at a gift exchange.

20:38.623 --> 20:41.324
- Yes!
- Uh, yeah.

20:41.359 --> 20:42.826
About that.

20:42.860 --> 20:45.095
Happy anniversary.

20:47.632 --> 20:50.333
It's the Iron Throne.

20:50.368 --> 20:52.169
Ohh! It's the Iron Throne.

20:52.203 --> 20:53.770
Yes, it is.

20:53.804 --> 20:56.506
I had a guy at the model store
make a replica.

20:56.541 --> 21:00.143
He's a bigger Game of Thrones
fan than you are.

21:00.177 --> 21:02.379
Okay, I know I'm making
that dumb surprise face,

21:02.413 --> 21:03.847
but I can't help it.

21:03.881 --> 21:06.016
This is the greatest gift
I've ever received, Leslie.

21:06.050 --> 21:09.085
When you play the game of thrones,
you win or you die.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.420
Yes.

21:10.454 --> 21:11.788
No.

21:11.822 --> 21:13.190
Yes.

21:13.224 --> 21:14.457
No!

21:14.492 --> 21:15.826
Come here.
Come hither, peasant.

21:15.860 --> 21:17.594
Come here. Who are you?

21:17.628 --> 21:19.129
Our starship is in trouble.

21:19.163 --> 21:20.831
Okay, Leslie, listen.

21:20.865 --> 21:22.695
If you're not... if you don't know
what you're talking about...
