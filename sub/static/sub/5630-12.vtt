WEBVTT

00:05.271 --> 00:08.240
- So does anybody know what
Little went away for?

00:08.242 --> 00:11.343
Killed Gi-Gi Dicaro,
a shakedown artist

00:11.345 --> 00:13.779
from Bridgeport, right under
the 35th Street red line stop.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.615
- So you gonna let him
dog you out like that

00:16.617 --> 00:18.317
about your wedding date
with Burgess?

00:18.319 --> 00:21.086
- [laughing] I could take him.
- Guy's like 6'6", 250, easy.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.454
- You would have my back,
obviously.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.455
Right?

00:23.457 --> 00:25.057
- Who? Me or Jay?

00:25.059 --> 00:26.592
Because I think I want
to watch that fight.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.260
[all laughing]

00:28.262 --> 00:29.428
- It's just surreal,
you know?

00:29.430 --> 00:32.031
The two of them,
they were cell mates.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.399
Now he's just
on the payroll.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.733
- I'm sure Voight
has his reasons.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.668
- Yeah.
He usually does.

00:39.639 --> 00:41.106
- All right, just, just...

00:41.108 --> 00:43.108
just run me through it
one more time.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.410
What's my cut?

00:44.412 --> 00:46.612
- 10% of all money seized.
- Uh-huh.

00:46.614 --> 00:47.746
And how do I get paid?

00:47.748 --> 00:49.114
Cash? Check? What?

00:49.116 --> 00:50.716
- CIs always get
paid cash so that way

00:50.718 --> 00:52.317
you can't trace it
to a bank account.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.153
- Good, I don't have a
bank account, anyway.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.454
And what am I looking at?

00:55.456 --> 00:57.523
- Soon as everything's
catalogued, signed off on.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.624
- Okay, what does that mean?

00:58.626 --> 01:01.360
Couple of days? A week? What--
- Hey.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.561
You talk to
Audrey about this?

01:02.563 --> 01:03.529
She's on board?

01:03.531 --> 01:05.464
- She's not thrilled.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.667
What choice does she have
if we're gonna get to Florida?

01:08.669 --> 01:09.802
Huh?

01:12.172 --> 01:15.374
- Rory Jensen has been
a CPD priority target

01:15.376 --> 01:16.675
for several years now.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.744
- Yeah, we went after him
hard when I was in Vice,

01:18.746 --> 01:20.579
but since he never laid
a finger on any dope,

01:20.581 --> 01:21.680
we could never grab him.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.682
- Remember that big
DEA bust last year?

01:23.684 --> 01:26.285
Caused a major cocaine
shortage in the city?

01:26.287 --> 01:30.089
Jensen is the guy who's
taking advantage of that.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.624
All right, you all know
Eddie Little, our new CI.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.393
You got the floor.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.228
- Well, me and Jensen
go way back.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.596
Met him in juvie.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.364
I was in for GTA,
he was in for

01:39.366 --> 01:41.233
rolling tourists
on Rush Street.

01:41.235 --> 01:44.336
Now he owns a string of
sports bars on the North Side.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.472
Sells watered-down liquor to
the college kids in front;

01:46.474 --> 01:49.374
in the back he slings his real
product to the local dealers.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.743
- Which is who we're
gonna hit first.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.713
See, we bust the crews
that Jensen's supplying,

01:54.715 --> 01:56.815
knock the legs out from
under his operation.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.251
- If the city's dry,
how's he getting his coke?

01:59.253 --> 02:00.452
- He's got a connection.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.721
I mean, not Mexico,
not the cartels.

02:02.723 --> 02:03.755
Ireland.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.224
He's got an old
family contact.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.758
They roll it across
the Canadian border.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.193
- You know all of this how?

02:09.196 --> 02:11.163
- I just got paroled
three days ago.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.165
I guarantee you I know more
about that's going down

02:13.167 --> 02:14.700
on the streets than
anybody in this room.

02:14.702 --> 02:15.901
- Okay.

02:15.903 --> 02:19.304
First target is
the Lost Disciples.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.407
Eddie has intel this little
motorcycle gang is receiving

02:22.409 --> 02:24.676
a shipment of Jensen's coke
tonight at their clubhouse.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.811
- I need a word.

02:31.718 --> 02:35.554
- So here's the blueprint for
the Lost Disciples' clubhouse.

02:38.758 --> 02:42.427
- This CI...

02:42.429 --> 02:43.595
he was your
cell mate, right?

02:43.597 --> 02:45.230
- That's right.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.598
And he's fresh
out of Stateville,

02:46.600 --> 02:48.200
so he's got knowledge
that would take

02:48.202 --> 02:50.335
my unit a year to gather.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.770
- Like what?

02:51.772 --> 02:53.172
- Rory Jensen.

02:55.642 --> 02:58.844
This is the best shot we've ever
had to take that guy down.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.614
- I just want to
make sure this isn't

03:02.616 --> 03:04.550
Stateville looking out
for Stateville.

03:04.552 --> 03:09.855
- This goes south, I need to
know you'll serve Little up.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.558
- Count on it.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.562
- Then knock yourself out.

03:18.464 --> 03:21.567
[engines rumbling distantly]

03:23.636 --> 03:25.904
- Hey, Tony,
are you in position?

03:25.906 --> 03:27.372
- All set.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.977
- About to breach.

03:34.247 --> 03:37.449
- Hold on, you got three
guys right on top of you.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.551
<i>Hold on.</i>

03:41.487 --> 03:44.323
- Get everything?
- Yeah, it's all good.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.896
[metallic clanging]

03:50.898 --> 03:54.600
- [whispering] All right,
everybody get back. Let's go.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.505
All right.

04:00.507 --> 04:04.643
Three...two...one.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.644
[explosion]

04:05.646 --> 04:06.645

04:11.885 --> 04:12.884

04:21.962 --> 04:22.894
[yelling]

04:22.896 --> 04:25.998
[guns firing]

04:32.005 --> 04:34.273
- Stay here.
Keep your eyes open.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.008
[gunshots]

04:36.010 --> 04:37.042
[thudding]

[glass shattering]

04:48.022 --> 04:49.821
[gunshots]

04:50.923 --> 04:55.527
- I can call in S.W.A.T.
and this can get serious,

04:55.529 --> 04:57.929
or you can toss
your weapons now.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.068
[glass shatters]

05:03.070 --> 05:04.069

- Show me your hands now!

05:17.918 --> 05:19.318
Show me your hands!
Don't move!

05:19.320 --> 05:20.786
Don't move!
Put your hands on the table!

05:20.788 --> 05:21.953
- Drop it!
Put them on the table!

05:21.955 --> 05:23.322
- Get up,
let me see your hands!

05:23.324 --> 05:25.424
- Put your hands on the table!
- Get up!

05:25.426 --> 05:27.492
- Drop them!
- Get up!

05:27.494 --> 05:30.329
[fire extinguisher hissing]

05:32.065 --> 05:33.565
- Make sure you keep them
separated, all right?

05:33.567 --> 05:34.666
- Okay.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.535
- Well, looks like
the intel was solid.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.769
- Let's go bag it.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.037
- Found this in the office.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.072
40 grand.

05:40.074 --> 05:44.343
- Put it with the rest.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.344
- [sighs]

<i>[tense music]</i>

05:48.349 --> 05:50.449
â™ª

05:52.418 --> 05:54.553
- I think that's
a great plan.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.055
You flank 'em like the
Allies in North Africa.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.990
- North Africa?
No, it's dinner.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.058
And it's not a plan.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.626
I mean, normal people
have dinner.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.862
- Still, having your mom
fly out to meet Adam's dad?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.530
I mean, if that doesn't
push him to settle

06:05.532 --> 06:06.798
on a wedding date,
what will?

06:06.800 --> 06:07.799
- No, no.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.501
My deposit on the ballroom

06:09.503 --> 06:11.002
was 3 grand.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.472
And if I don't get that
back in full by way of

06:13.474 --> 06:16.408
a certified cashier's
check, I will be sending

06:16.410 --> 06:18.777
a city inspector to check
for faulty wiring.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.412
I'm so sorry,
can you hold?

06:20.414 --> 06:23.448
- You see, this is why I've
never been engaged.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.518
And here I thought it was
on account of you being

06:26.520 --> 06:27.619
a heartless jag-off.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.422
- Hey, I've been in
love many times.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.959
They just all turn
out to be crazy.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.928
- Intelligence busted
the Lost Disciples' clubhouse.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.697
And besides a lot
of dope and guns,

06:38.699 --> 06:40.966
they seized six crates
of stolen goods.

06:40.968 --> 06:44.736
I need you to catalogue
the swag and track down

06:44.738 --> 06:45.737
the rightful owners.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.139
- Wow.
Lost property detail?

06:47.141 --> 06:50.175
- There are no small
assignments, Burgess.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.078
Just small-minded patrolmen.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.479
You still there?

06:54.481 --> 06:57.416
Great, that's Platt
with two Ts.

06:57.418 --> 07:00.419
No, two Ts.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.087
- Well?
- What? 10 kilos.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.955
It's a nice grab.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.591
We only got 40k in cash
out of that clubhouse, though.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.859
- No, no, no,
I heard the Disciples

07:07.861 --> 07:09.428
had more than
that in there.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.029
It's got to be in the
walls or someplace.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.898
- Eddie, it's what we got.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.466
- 4k?

07:14.468 --> 07:16.201
That's not gonna get me
new tires on this junker.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.969
- So take the job I got you.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.805
- What're you talking about?

07:19.807 --> 07:21.540
I thought we were partners?

07:21.542 --> 07:22.974
You know how many days
it's gonna take me

07:22.976 --> 07:25.677
clocking in and clocking out of
that warehouse to make 75k?

07:25.679 --> 07:27.813
- All right, just go home,
see your girls.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.114
We'll talk later.

07:32.820 --> 07:36.955
This was just sent over
from property crimes.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.557
It's all the
burglaries and thefts

07:38.559 --> 07:39.624
over the last
three months.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.725
- It never ends.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.093
- Some days you're
chasing bad guys,

07:42.095 --> 07:43.562
some days
you're doing this.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.963
- Hey, Kim.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.899
Can I talk to you quick?
- Sure.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.702
Hi.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.204
- My dad can't
make it tonight.

07:52.206 --> 07:53.805
He's got to work
Violence Reduction.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.607
- When did you find that out?
- He just called.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.676
You know how it is with those
shifts, they just pop up.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.044
- Did you tell him
that my mom's, like,

07:59.046 --> 08:00.111
only in town one night?

08:00.113 --> 08:02.247
- Yeah, I know.
He's really sorry.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.683
- Huh.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.685
- What?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.220
- All week.

08:08.222 --> 08:11.089
We've been talking about
this for a month.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.891
- Well, baby,
I mean...

08:12.893 --> 08:14.826
You and I both know what
it's like with overtime.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.027
Pop can't pass that up.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.864
Hey, listen, we'll
talk about this later.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.198
Just--would you
tell your mom that

08:20.200 --> 08:21.967
we're both really,
really sorry?

08:21.969 --> 08:23.134
Would you tell her that?

08:23.136 --> 08:25.237
I got to go.
Okay?

08:32.078 --> 08:34.546
- I'm not gonna
say a thing.

of time before

- You two okay?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.252
- Who was he?

09:47.254 --> 09:49.721
- Just a bad guy
posing as FBI.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.257
- I got another problem.

They're gonna put me back inside

She was.

Come here, honey.

Come here.

Good, good, good.

Right there.

Ah, that's good.
That's good, honey--

Hank Voight, intelligence.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.730
You need to put the girls
in protective custody.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.064

to be separated.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.933
- It's all right,
I'll take you to the district.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.635

clothes and stuff?

get them later, okay?

11:33.093 --> 11:35.994
- Who?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.362
- Eddie.

- He's...

he's not my dad.

Thank you.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.862

get them insured.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.731
- Reached out to every
complaint in our record.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.498
That should cover it.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.501

it goes to auction.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.936
- Thanks.

12:20.339 --> 12:22.407
- "To my girl."

12:22.409 --> 12:25.410
Wonder who she was.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.312
- The number listed here's
no longer in service.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.214
- Yeah? Well, what's
the address?

12:29.216 --> 12:31.883
- 3421 North Pine Grove.

- Want to find out?

12:33.487 --> 12:34.786
- Not really.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.488
- Great. We're going.

12:42.161 --> 12:44.062
- IAD called twice
about the shooting.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.131
- Huh, they can read
the sworn statements.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.766
- If Eddie was involved...

12:47.768 --> 12:50.335
- He was asleep at the time.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.303
So where're we at?

12:52.305 --> 12:53.938
- We didn't get any
connection to Jensen

12:53.940 --> 12:56.107
off any of the
Disciples' phones.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.409
- We're gonna kick out the next
leg from Jensen's operation.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.411
That's the 25 Boys,
named after caliber they like

13:00.413 --> 13:01.946
to use on the back
of people's heads.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.548
- I put a call in to a friend.
He owes me a favor.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.883
He can confirm
that they're

13:04.885 --> 13:06.317
slinging cocaine
through Chinatown.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.453
- And I'm running all male
members and their relatives

Got paroled last year.
Henry Yu.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.065

13:21.067 --> 13:23.168
Yu, he's a heavy
hitter around Cermak.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.203
He'll talk.
But not for less than 20 grand.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.805
- Yeah, give him 10.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.573
- What'd I just say?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.441
10's not gonna do it.

13:33.546 --> 13:37.115
- You know what a
CI does, Eddie?

13:37.117 --> 13:42.287
A CI does whatever the
hell I tell him to do.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.321
- So, uh, 10 then?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.390
- Sign it out of
the 1505 fund.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.891
- Yes, sir.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.234
- Can you hear me?

13:57.870 --> 13:59.270
- Loud and clear.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.052
- Hey.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.321
You know, last time
I saw your boss,

14:16.323 --> 14:17.555
we both had kitchen duty.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.225
He washed the dishes,
I dried.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.360
We got to pocket the extra
biscuits, though, didn't we?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.495
- What do you want, Eddie?

14:30.569 --> 14:33.404
- Where do 25 Boys
cut their snow?

14:33.406 --> 14:36.574
Think I'd help the
police with 10,000, huh?

14:36.576 --> 14:39.110
Word travels fast, Eddie.

beating up on his
girlfriend like that.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.359
I know a couple dirty
white boys who would just kill

14:54.361 --> 14:58.263
to have this 10 grand deposited
in their canteen account.

- Do the cops know what kind of
<i>snake they're in bed with?</i>

15:12.412 --> 15:14.512
- Let's just play it out.

15:17.616 --> 15:19.150

next drug test, don't breathe.

- What?

17:03.455 --> 17:04.454
- It's dinner.

Who can't show
up for a dinner?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.196
I tell you it's
not going to work

17:13.199 --> 17:17.502
and you get married,
then I'm the jag-off.

17:19.070 --> 17:20.471
We're looking for
Gloria Hayden.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.772
- What's this regarding?

17:21.775 --> 17:23.608
- We wanted to
return this to her.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.576
- I can't believe
you found this.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.478
Please come in.

17:29.114 --> 17:32.617
Our home was broken
into some months back.

17:32.619 --> 17:36.587
I bought that in Tokyo on a one
night layover back from Vietnam.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.322
- My father was in Vietnam.

17:38.324 --> 17:42.293
- That was 3rd Battalion,
I was in the 1st.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.763
I remember the day
I got off the plane.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.765
Gloria was there.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.802
I didn't have money for
a ring, but I had this.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.071
I proposed right
then and there.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.073
- If you knew she was the
one, why wait, right?

17:55.075 --> 17:56.441
- [chuckles]

17:56.443 --> 17:58.509
- We just need Gloria to
sign for her property.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.612
- Uh, she won't
be doing that.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.448
She's at
Rosehill Cemetery.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.752
- Young lady,
don't be sorry.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.188
We had 46 years together.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.434
- How much longer
do we have to be here?

18:23.436 --> 18:26.237
- Just got to take care
of some formalities.

18:26.239 --> 18:29.340
Then the three of
us are out of here.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.412
- Um...

18:34.414 --> 18:37.248
I know it's not much, but if
either of you's hungry,

18:37.250 --> 18:39.150
there's a vending machine.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.184
- Good idea.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.854
Tracy, do you
want anything?

18:42.856 --> 18:44.622
- It's, um...

18:44.624 --> 18:47.258

past the front desk.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.693
- Thanks.

18:53.232 --> 18:54.699
- She's blind.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.636
- How do you mean?

18:58.638 --> 19:00.371
- Eddie.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.841
My mom won't see him
for what he really is.

19:07.513 --> 19:12.884
You know, Eddie's the one that
shot the biker, not my mom.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.686
And she just lied
to protect him.

19:19.758 --> 19:22.827
- I think we need to keep
that between me and you.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.229
- Why?

19:25.231 --> 19:27.398
- Because you don't need things
to get more complicated

19:27.400 --> 19:29.300
than they already are.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.436
And I don't want your
mom to get in trouble.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.842
- I just don't trust him.

19:41.780 --> 19:45.750
- Do you want me to talk
to your mom about this?

19:45.752 --> 19:47.451
- Not gonna listen
to you, either.

to a reward for the

20:00.500 --> 20:02.300
street value of the
drugs we seized.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.801
That's $25,000.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.504
- On top of the 10%?
- Yeah.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.640
And with what we got
so far, plus that,

20:09.642 --> 20:11.742
you're looking
at 40k, Eddie.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.878
- That ain't 75.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.847
- I'm doing everything I'm
authorized to do.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.650
- What'd you tell people I did
for you inside, anyway?

20:22.554 --> 20:24.388
- You want a major score?

20:24.390 --> 20:27.258

was this your plan
the whole time?

20:46.546 --> 20:50.248
- We either do this together,
or I take it to Narcotics.

They'd love to have
this notch in their belt.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.269
- Well, I don't know
what you remember.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.337
I ate a manslaughter
wrap for the guy.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.472
And what did he do?

21:14.474 --> 21:15.539
He got rich.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.475
None of my family
saw a dime.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.711
- The lab already confirmed
that the coke we seized

21:20.713 --> 21:24.482
off the 25 Boys is the same coke
that we got off the bikers.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.550
It's 99% pure,
so it's Jensen's.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.024
- Okay, so what's
the angle here?

21:33.026 --> 21:34.592
- I am.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.899
I go in with Eddie,
play the role,

21:41.901 --> 21:44.835
we tell Jensen we get his drugs
out of evidence for a cut rate.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.671
- Okay, Sarge,
we'll run backup,

21:46.673 --> 21:48.005
we'll put surveillance
on the bar--

21:48.007 --> 21:50.508
- It's just me
and Eddie on this.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.576
- [sighs]

21:52.578 --> 21:54.345
Before you go anywhere,
we got to talk.

22:03.455 --> 22:05.923
All right, look.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.892
If you have some secret deal
going on with Eddie,

22:07.894 --> 22:09.727
I need to know right now.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.929
- He's helping us take
down a priority target.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.331
You got a problem
with that?

22:14.866 --> 22:17.068
- I have a problem
with using this unit

22:17.070 --> 22:18.602
to pay off an
old prison debt.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.540
- Maybe you should
sit this one out.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.675
- What dirt does he have on you?
- It's not like that.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.344
- No? Well, then tell me,
what's it like?

22:26.346 --> 22:29.613
Because I'm thinking this is
all to get your guy a payday.

22:31.884 --> 22:35.553
what it was like
for me on the inside?

22:35.555 --> 22:37.755
After you put
the cuffs on me?

22:37.757 --> 22:39.890
- What's that got to
do with anything?

22:39.892 --> 22:42.426
- Every guy I ever locked up
knew I was coming.

22:42.428 --> 22:46.030
Still, I chose gen pop.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.399
No protective custody.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.935
So I'm in there two days,
and the word comes back

22:50.937 --> 22:53.037
that the whole tier's
coming after me.

22:53.039 --> 22:57.074
You know, you kill a cop,
you're top dog.

23:01.947 --> 23:03.914
They jumped me
in the kitchen.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.517
Four guys.

23:06.519 --> 23:10.888
One of them's got a shank
the size of a butcher knife.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.125
And, man,
I put up a fight.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.934
I wasn't afraid to die.

23:28.573 --> 23:32.176
But I was afraid of how
my son might remember me.

23:39.551 --> 23:43.053
Anyway, Eddie showed
up in the kitchen.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.489
Had a few friends.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.496
From then on,
I was protected.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.767
The only
reason I ever got

23:56.769 --> 23:59.870
a second chance
to be the police...

23:59.872 --> 24:04.909
a father,
now a grandfather...

24:06.478 --> 24:09.013
Is because of him.

24:21.693 --> 24:24.695
[upbeat rock music]

24:24.697 --> 24:28.632
â™ª

24:28.634 --> 24:29.800
- Jensen.

24:32.737 --> 24:33.938
[button clicks]

24:39.711 --> 24:41.679
- No wires.
[door slams shut]

24:41.681 --> 24:44.782
There's no way you're
taking either of those.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.584
- Eddie Little!
- Hey.

24:46.586 --> 24:47.952
- So you're back from
the tombs, huh?

24:47.954 --> 24:50.254
- Hey.
- Let him go.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.822
Sweetheart, give us
a minute, no?

24:51.824 --> 24:53.724
- Sure.

24:53.726 --> 24:56.961
- And the infamous
sergeant from the 21.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.562
- Rory, look at you.

24:58.564 --> 25:00.130
How many of these
joints you have now?

25:00.132 --> 25:01.699
Four, five?

25:01.701 --> 25:04.268
You must be printing money
during Cubs season.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.136
- I get by.
I do okay.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.239
- [laughs]
You hear that, Hank?

25:08.241 --> 25:10.608
He says he gets by.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.743
Nice.
- Okay.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.778
So you call me after
all these years, Eddie,

25:14.780 --> 25:17.515
and you tell me that
you're working for the cops.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.717
And that you got
a deal for me.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.218
Let it not be said
that you don't have

25:21.220 --> 25:23.287
one set of balls
on you, huh?

25:23.289 --> 25:25.289
- I got an offer.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.857
You know that coke
that was taken off

25:26.859 --> 25:28.926
the Disciples
and the 25 Boys?

25:28.928 --> 25:29.960
30 kilos?

25:29.962 --> 25:32.062
Came from you;
we both know that.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.964
I can get it
back for you.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.733
You can resell it,
make 100% profit.

25:35.735 --> 25:38.569
And how am I supposed
to do that when I got

25:38.571 --> 25:41.105
Narcotics
investigating me?

25:43.241 --> 25:47.678
Oof.
- That's good faith.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.680
- I pick that up and
three seconds later,

25:49.682 --> 25:52.116
I got all my doors
crashed in, right?

25:52.118 --> 25:53.250
That's what's
gonna happen.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.818
- Take a look outside.

25:54.820 --> 25:58.255
There's nobody there.

25:58.257 --> 26:01.659
This is about me
getting square with Eddie

26:01.661 --> 26:04.194
and Eddie getting
square with you.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.864
This deal...

26:06.866 --> 26:08.799
comes with
my personal guarantee

26:08.801 --> 26:10.768
you'll be protected
from Narcotics.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.239
- You know, when
I first heard that

26:15.241 --> 26:16.974
Eddie protected
you inside...

26:16.976 --> 26:22.580
- I thought the man gone
insane, lost his mind.

26:22.582 --> 26:25.115
But I guess it was just
Eddie looking at his own

26:25.117 --> 26:26.750
big picture, right?

26:29.654 --> 26:33.724
You talk about a long,
long con, Sergeant.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.378
- We want a million too.
- [laughs]

26:54.380 --> 26:56.847
- Worth twice that.
Come on.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.249
- I'll give you 600 grand.

27:02.387 --> 27:05.055
- So 800?

27:09.995 --> 27:12.262
- If we do go into
business together...

27:12.264 --> 27:14.064
- Hmm.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.100
You work for me
just like every other guy

27:16.102 --> 27:17.101
on my payroll.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.202
That understood?

27:21.206 --> 27:24.208
Understood?

27:24.210 --> 27:25.943
- I understand.

27:30.815 --> 27:34.251
- So we meet at our old haunt
tomorrow at Remington Heights.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.719
Noon okay with you?

27:35.721 --> 27:37.054
- Yeah, fine.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.889
- All right.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.030
[indistinct chatter]

27:46.032 --> 27:50.734
Been 12 years since I tasted
anything that smooth.

27:50.736 --> 27:52.970
Inside, you dream about
moments like this.

27:52.972 --> 27:55.406
Good drink, good food,
good woman.

27:55.408 --> 27:58.308
- Yeah, it sure seems like you
found a good one with Audrey.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.677
- Yeah, yeah.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.278
I got no right to
a woman that good.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.013
- Hmm.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.883
- All these years,
I'm finally gonna get a payday.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.384
Build a life with
a real family.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.453
- You know, Eddie,
if this thing goes sideways

28:09.455 --> 28:13.023
with Jensen and you don't
make it out tomorrow,

28:13.025 --> 28:14.725
you're not gonna
have that chance.

28:14.727 --> 28:16.293
- [laughs]

28:16.295 --> 28:18.929
Come on, Hank,
think good thoughts.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.197
Come on.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.032
Here.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.233
To a win-win.
[glasses clink]

28:23.235 --> 28:25.969
For both of us.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.404
- Win-win.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.839
- Yeah.

28:31.242 --> 28:33.243
[chuckles]

28:39.951 --> 28:42.152
- Okay, just--
- Hey, I'm not wearing a wire!

28:42.154 --> 28:46.824
It's basically undetectable.
It goes underneath your--

28:46.826 --> 28:48.125
- I'm not wearing
a camera, then.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.226
- Eddie.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.195
We got to get this
deal on video.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.030
- I get made,
this whole thing blows up.

28:53.032 --> 28:55.265
There's no deal.
You understand?

28:55.267 --> 28:58.368
- Look, Sergeant, I could tap
into track security.

28:58.370 --> 28:59.436
I'll get whatever
you need.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.739
- Yeah. Do that.

29:01.741 --> 29:03.841
- Just make sure
you got eyes on Jensen.

29:03.843 --> 29:04.842
<i>- All right.</i>

29:04.844 --> 29:07.144
29 keys of pure, boss.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.779
- All right,
Jensen is gonna be coming in

29:08.781 --> 29:11.815
strapped and with backup.

29:11.817 --> 29:14.284
As soon as we exchange
the bricks for the cash,

29:14.286 --> 29:16.386
we wait for Eddie to be clear...

29:16.388 --> 29:18.422
and then take him.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.324
- All right.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.159
- Hey. You.

29:22.161 --> 29:26.130
Stay out of my family's
business, you understand?

29:26.132 --> 29:27.765
- I'm just looking
out for them.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.233
- How about we get in
the car and we do this?

29:29.235 --> 29:31.034
All right?

29:40.779 --> 29:43.247
- [indistinct chatter]

29:43.249 --> 29:44.348
- Thanks.

29:46.551 --> 29:49.820
I bet Sandy Bottoms to
place first in the fifth.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.421
- Great.
So we're partners, right?

29:51.423 --> 29:55.125
So if you win, then that means
you have to give me half.

29:59.564 --> 30:01.098
What's up?

30:03.168 --> 30:05.903
- They can't take Tracy
to Florida.

30:07.872 --> 30:10.874
- Isn't that
her mom's call?

30:10.876 --> 30:12.943
- Her mom's got
blinders on.

31:12.237 --> 31:13.503
- Mouse, you got him?

31:13.505 --> 31:16.273
- Yup. I hacked into
the track's security cams.

31:16.275 --> 31:17.307
I'm up and running.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.543
[keyboard clacking]

31:34.325 --> 31:35.325
- [sighs]

31:35.327 --> 31:38.128
Beautiful day.
- Yes it is.

[shouting]

31:41.533 --> 31:43.567
[cheering]

31:43.569 --> 31:46.570
- You know, I've been thinking
about Gi-Gi Dicaro lately.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.972
- Gi-Gi Dicaro?

31:48.974 --> 31:51.642
Why you bringing up
Gi-Gi Dicaro?

31:51.644 --> 31:53.176
- It's just that
everybody thought

31:53.178 --> 31:57.047
that I took him out
because he owed us money.

31:57.049 --> 32:00.617
I never told anybody
the real reason.

32:00.619 --> 32:04.021
What that pervert did
to your sister.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.189
- We've been through this.
Why you bringing up my sister?

32:06.191 --> 32:09.293
What the hell has
gotten into you?

32:09.295 --> 32:11.662
Look, I appreciate the way
you handled that, okay?

32:11.664 --> 32:14.998
- Didn't appreciate it enough to
send even a postcard, did you?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.600
- Look...

32:16.602 --> 32:19.102
this squares us.

32:19.104 --> 32:22.306
for whatever that you think
I owe you, all right?

32:22.308 --> 32:24.308
Consider it back pay
or whatever.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.311
Lost years, whatever.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.614
800 large.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.417

Sergeant Hank Voight.

32:53.604 --> 32:55.472

32:55.474 --> 32:56.974
- We're good.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.608
- Good.

32:58.610 --> 33:01.745
It was good to
see you, Eddie.

33:01.747 --> 33:04.181
Go live your life
loud and fast.

33:06.084 --> 33:08.685
- That's the plan.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.287
- Mouse, we good?

33:10.289 --> 33:11.722
- Yes, sir, we're good.

33:24.635 --> 33:27.337
- All right, you take
Jensen, I got Eddie.

33:37.081 --> 33:38.181
- Move in.

- Police!

Get back!

34:10.681 --> 34:12.449
- Come here.
Come on.

34:12.451 --> 34:13.550
- Get out of the way!

34:25.763 --> 34:27.097
- Drop it!

34:27.099 --> 34:29.632
Drop the gun!

34:29.635 --> 34:31.301
Drop it!

34:34.304 --> 34:35.639
I got a vest on.
Do you?

34:35.641 --> 34:37.808
They'll be cleaning you
off the walls for a week.

34:37.810 --> 34:38.809
Do it!

34:38.811 --> 34:42.212
- [yells]
- Do it!

34:42.214 --> 34:44.781
- [grunting]

34:46.751 --> 34:49.619

hey, hey!

34:49.621 --> 34:51.822
- You punk piece--
- Don't move.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.159
All right, let's go.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.530

35:00.532 --> 35:03.400
- I got the CI,
meet you back at 21.

35:06.871 --> 35:09.206
- We're not going
back to district

35:09.208 --> 35:12.809
to voucher any
of this cash.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.244
- Eddie.

- Drive.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.631

35:34.633 --> 35:38.802
- Yeah, didn't have to steal my
first car when I was 14, either.

Out of the car.

[train rumbling]

35:44.475 --> 35:46.643
- Audrey and her kid,
they part of your plan?

35:46.645 --> 35:49.246
- Breaks my heart.
It truly does.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.148
Guys like us are
better off alone.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.149
- Eddie...

35:52.151 --> 35:55.252
- On your knees.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.827
[crunching]

36:08.566 --> 36:10.867
No hard feelings, bro.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.774
[gunshot, air hissing]

36:28.286 --> 36:29.920
- Hey, Eddie.

36:29.922 --> 36:32.222
Hands on the car.
Now.

36:44.235 --> 36:46.469
- No hard feelings, bro.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.873
- Just when I was
beginning to trust you.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.508
- Turn around.

36:53.578 --> 36:56.646
Get on your knees.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.615
- Hank, let's call
it even, huh?

36:58.617 --> 37:00.917
- Eddie...

37:00.919 --> 37:04.788
we were even at
4:00 this afternoon.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.394
Cuff him.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.518
- Had to take
the shot, bro.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.521
- Well, you're
a big-picture guy, Eddie.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.957
You were just never
strong on the details.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.892
- I leave that to you.

37:47.865 --> 37:50.567
- All right,
let's get this inventoried.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.943
- Great bust.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.279
Jensen's looking
at 20 years.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.648
- Not without
Eddie's help.

38:06.617 --> 38:09.319
I want to give the CI
money to his family.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.654
- They're not married.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.790
There's no way the state's
attorney would go for that.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.760
- It's the right
thing to do.

38:20.865 --> 38:23.300
- This history between you
two--must've been hard,

38:23.302 --> 38:25.869
bringing Little back
here in cuffs.

38:40.785 --> 38:43.053
We'll make an exception.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.831
- This is $80,000.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.400
It's 10% of the bust.

38:57.402 --> 38:59.736
It'll get you to Florida.

39:02.073 --> 39:05.675
- I never wanted
the money.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.478
I only wanted a life
with Eddie.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.613
- Mom.

39:10.615 --> 39:13.717
Eddie lied to you.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.785
And he was going
to leave us.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.021
- [sobs]

39:20.091 --> 39:22.692
- Take the money.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.828
Start over.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.881
Look, you have
my phone number.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.784
If you ever need anything,
you just call me.

39:49.086 --> 39:50.754
- Thanks.

40:17.815 --> 40:19.082
- Hey.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.683
Everyone's going
to Molly's.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.552
Meet up with some of
the fire cats from 51.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.421
You want to go?

40:24.423 --> 40:25.855
- I don't think so.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.824
- No?

40:27.826 --> 40:29.726
- [softly] No.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.434
- What's going on?
You okay?

40:40.438 --> 40:44.207
- You were never gonna
meet my mom, were you?

40:44.209 --> 40:45.475
'Cause you were afraid
if you did,

40:45.477 --> 40:47.143
the wedding would become real.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.879
- [sighs]

40:49.881 --> 40:51.648
Come on.

40:51.650 --> 40:54.017
Hey, where's this
coming from?

40:54.019 --> 40:56.186
- It's fine.

40:56.188 --> 40:58.154
I accept it now.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.862
You don't want to
be on the hook.

41:09.700 --> 41:12.135
I am letting you off.

41:13.737 --> 41:16.039
- Kim...
