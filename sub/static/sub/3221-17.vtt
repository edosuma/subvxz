00:05.057 --> 00:07.017
I think these are
John Winchester's boys.

00:07.459 --> 00:10.179
Ha-ha-ha. Hey, I'm Ellen.
That's my daughter, Jo.

00:11.129 --> 00:12.939
The can of whoop-ass
I ought to open...

00:13.365 --> 00:15.205
- Better put me on speed dial.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:15.634 --> 00:16.944
Those are hellhounds out there.

00:17.302 --> 00:20.082
We let the dogs in, you make a break
for the building next over.

00:20.639 --> 00:21.979
I wait here
with my finger on the button.

00:22.374 --> 00:24.454
If I can get us a shot on the devil,
we take it.

00:24.910 --> 00:26.370
I will not leave you here alone.

00:31.383 --> 00:33.373
- It's civil war up there.
- I know.

00:33.819 --> 00:36.009
If we can beat Raphael,
we can end this.

00:36.488 --> 00:37.538
You did more than rebel.

00:37.856 --> 00:40.436
You tore up the script
and burned the pages for all of us.

00:40.993 --> 00:42.983
Do you have any idea
what souls are worth?

00:43.428 --> 00:45.418
- What power they hold?
- Have you seen this man?

00:45.864 --> 00:47.204
- Rufus Turner?
- No.

00:47.566 --> 00:49.296
I ain't asking for no help.
Never seen that dick.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.041
Not asking for your permission.

00:51.403 --> 00:53.423
- Just like old times.
- Long as I get to drive.

00:54.873 --> 00:57.683
- What are you?
- Eve cooked me up herself.

00:58.243 --> 01:00.413
The mother of all of us.

01:00.879 --> 01:02.369
She has a message for you.

01:02.948 --> 01:04.348
Bobby!

01:09.888 --> 01:11.088
It was my fault.

01:45.057 --> 01:46.807
Piece of crap.

01:59.471 --> 02:00.701
Damn it.

03:19.484 --> 03:20.824
Say something.

03:21.186 --> 03:22.206
<i>You.</i>

03:22.521 --> 03:23.891
No. You.

03:37.803 --> 03:40.523
You two just gonna stand there
like the ugly girl at the prom...

03:41.073 --> 03:42.623
or are you gonna pitch in?

03:43.108 --> 03:46.858
This so-called Eve, mother, whatever,
ain't gonna gank herself.

03:49.181 --> 03:51.111
What's wrong with you two?

03:52.050 --> 03:53.630
Bobby, you haven't slept in days.

03:54.019 --> 03:56.009
I sleep. What are you, my wife now?

03:57.255 --> 03:59.185
I'm just saying that, you know...

03:59.624 --> 04:02.144
- taking five might be a good thing.
- For whom?

04:02.928 --> 04:05.888
Look, Bobby,
it was tough for all of us...

04:07.766 --> 04:09.816
- seeing Rufus go like that.
- You think this...?

04:12.437 --> 04:15.247
- This ain't about Rufus.
- Bobby, he wasn't just a poker buddy.

04:16.942 --> 04:18.812
You know when I knew
Rufus was done for?

04:19.244 --> 04:20.324
The day I met him.

04:20.644 --> 04:22.665
The only question was who first.
Him or me?

04:23.115 --> 04:26.105
You wanna stand there and therapize
or you wanna get me some coffee?

04:27.786 --> 04:28.746
Make it Irish.

04:33.792 --> 04:35.082
Well, he's doing fantastic.

04:35.427 --> 04:37.797
Yeah. This isn't about Rufus at all.

04:38.563 --> 04:40.053
Well, what do you wanna do?

04:40.432 --> 04:42.982
We can't just sit here
and watch him poop out his liver.

04:43.535 --> 04:46.875
Well, we could get him out of the house.
There's a job.

04:47.539 --> 04:49.119
Really? What do you got?

04:50.275 --> 04:51.295
Look.

04:51.610 --> 04:52.600
Chester, Pennsylvania.

04:52.911 --> 04:56.221
Three people got kicked off
in the last week. All freaky.

04:56.848 --> 04:59.188
Last guy got karate-chopped
by his garage door.

04:59.684 --> 05:01.264
And these are all blood relatives.

05:01.653 --> 05:03.703
- What are you thinking, family curse?
- Could be.

05:04.156 --> 05:05.496
Hey, grumpy...

05:07.292 --> 05:10.692
- You. uh...
- I don't wanna do crap. Leave me alone.

05:11.329 --> 05:12.289
Now, just...

05:12.597 --> 05:16.107
Get out of my house, both of you.
You're driving me nuts.

05:17.135 --> 05:18.865
- Bobby.
- Now.

05:19.771 --> 05:21.911
For the love of Pete.

05:42.460 --> 05:45.240
You know, maybe we should wait
till she gets back.

05:45.797 --> 05:47.937
She just called,
said she'd be here in two shakes.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.510
Wanna sit around
and smell him stew in his juices?

05:50.969 --> 05:52.719
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Drive.

06:07.052 --> 06:09.192
- What the...?
- Tell me you haven't been drinking...

06:09.654 --> 06:11.904
- this whole time.
- You're worse than the boys.

06:12.390 --> 06:13.820
- I'm working.
- My God.

06:14.192 --> 06:17.002
I'm gone a week
and this place goes completely to hell.

06:17.929 --> 06:21.299
- What is wrong with you, Bobby Singer?
- Get a pen. It's a long list.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.277
You smell like a bar, you know that?

06:24.669 --> 06:27.189
You don't exactly smell like a rose
yourself.

06:27.706 --> 06:29.816
Ha. Yeah, I been hunting with Jo.
What's your excuse?

06:30.275 --> 06:32.005
If I need one, I got a good one.

06:37.749 --> 06:38.709
I know.

06:39.584 --> 06:41.664
And I'm so sorry.

06:42.153 --> 06:43.793
He meant a lot to me too.

06:47.926 --> 06:49.706
Go wash up. I'll fix us something.

06:50.161 --> 06:51.911
Anybody ever tell you
you're a pain in the ass?

06:55.734 --> 06:57.074
That's why you married me.

06:58.203 --> 06:59.133
Go.

07:00.372 --> 07:01.742
Don't tell me what to do, Ellen.

07:19.124 --> 07:22.964
- Not a blip.
- Well, not a vengeful spirit, then.

07:24.696 --> 07:26.096
So, what is it?

07:35.974 --> 07:37.234
Huh.

07:38.576 --> 07:40.126
What you got?

07:43.848 --> 07:46.568
- What is that, Christmas tinsel?
- I don't know.

07:55.593 --> 07:56.523
It's gold.

07:56.828 --> 07:58.378
Do you mean, like, "gold" gold?

07:58.763 --> 08:02.013
Why would a handyman have gold
just lying around in his garage?

08:02.934 --> 08:06.094
I don't know. There is definitely
a skeleton in this family's closet.

08:07.272 --> 08:10.112
I mean,
accidents don't just happen accidentally.

08:11.643 --> 08:12.723
You know what I mean.

08:13.044 --> 08:16.174
All right. I'll go check family records,
you go with next of kin?

08:17.549 --> 08:18.779
Yeah.

08:21.686 --> 08:22.946
Yeah. The courthouse steps.

08:23.288 --> 08:26.308
For the deposition.
No, I told you, 3 p.m.

08:26.891 --> 08:27.851
No. My usual fees.

08:28.793 --> 08:30.253
Yeah. I gotta go, Ma.

08:33.264 --> 08:34.813
I'm sorry. Uh, what department?

08:35.200 --> 08:38.659
Genealogy. From the university.
We're doing a study on local families.

08:39.304 --> 08:42.234
- And the Russos are a big...
- I am extremely busy right now, so...

08:42.807 --> 08:44.707
Yeah.
I'm sure you've had a rough week.

08:45.143 --> 08:47.773
I, uh, read about the recent tragedies.
Your cousins, right?

08:48.713 --> 08:49.823
Yeah. It's a shame.

08:50.148 --> 08:53.018
But I'm not that close with my family,
so, uh...

08:54.085 --> 08:56.665
- Is this gonna take long?
- No. Five minutes. Five minutes.

08:57.188 --> 09:00.378
Uh, can you tell me anything, uh,
noteworthy about the Russos?

09:00.992 --> 09:02.802
Noteworthy? No.

09:03.228 --> 09:04.718
I mean, not exactly. Average.

09:05.096 --> 09:06.386
You know, big, from Italy.

09:07.098 --> 09:08.238
I see.

09:08.566 --> 09:12.756
Uh, was anyone ever killed
or maimed in a war...

09:13.505 --> 09:16.135
or, you know,
some other violent thing?

09:18.209 --> 09:20.729
- What do you mean?
- Something so dark that it would sully...

09:21.246 --> 09:22.206
future generations.

09:23.014 --> 09:24.124
Heh, uh...

09:24.883 --> 09:26.343
No.

09:27.051 --> 09:28.361
Good. Hey, good stuff.

09:29.587 --> 09:31.577
Anyone own a slave?

09:32.957 --> 09:34.827
- What?
- Routine question.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.630
Any ties to the Nazi Party?

09:37.962 --> 09:40.132
- Excuse me?
- Did grandma ever piss off a gypsy?

09:42.367 --> 09:45.967
Okay. I don't know what kind of study
you're doing, but it's over right now.

09:46.638 --> 09:50.418
- So if you don't mind...
- Okay, I'll just cut to the chase here.

09:51.709 --> 09:52.879
Your life is in danger.

09:53.745 --> 09:55.995
What? What is that, a threa...?
Are you threatening me?

09:56.481 --> 09:59.761
No, no, no. I'm not threatening you.
I'm just simply saying...

10:00.385 --> 10:03.455
that if you don't watch your back,
you're gonna die.

10:04.456 --> 10:05.356
Get out of my office.

10:05.657 --> 10:07.387
- Okay.
- Now!

10:11.963 --> 10:12.953
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Sam.

10:14.466 --> 10:15.426
Find anything?

10:15.733 --> 10:17.813
One asshat in a shiny suit. You?

10:18.269 --> 10:20.519
Not much.
Great-grandparents born in Calabria...

10:21.005 --> 10:23.115
<i>emigrated 2922.
They've been here ever since.</i>

10:23.575 --> 10:24.975
What, no severed horse head?

10:25.643 --> 10:27.073
Four generations of picket fence.

10:28.780 --> 10:31.680
If these people are the Waltons,
then why the hell are they dying?

10:35.420 --> 10:36.790
Well, how about Cuba?

10:37.155 --> 10:40.665
It's beautiful this time of year.
And the new Trump Casino? Amazing.

10:41.326 --> 10:43.516
Don't worry about the kids.
There's a wave pool.

10:43.995 --> 10:46.275
Oh, sure, yeah.

11:04.015 --> 11:06.475
Look, if you like cigars, Cher,
or the circus...

11:06.985 --> 11:09.005
it's all about Havana.

11:12.290 --> 11:15.160
Yes. I've seen those Shatner ads.
But you know what they don't have?

11:15.727 --> 11:17.777
Personal touch.

11:18.530 --> 11:21.340
Okay, then.
I'll e-mail you some details.

11:21.933 --> 11:22.863
You too.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.480
Anne Witting.
We're sure she's not a Russo...

13:00.990 --> 13:02.890
a second cousin twice removed
or something?

13:03.325 --> 13:05.605
No. I checked the records twice.
She's not related.

13:08.530 --> 13:10.170
Well, if this isn't a family curse...

13:10.566 --> 13:12.116
- what the hell is it?
- You got me.

13:13.369 --> 13:14.949
I got nothing.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.272
Hold on.

13:26.482 --> 13:27.412
Not nothing.

13:32.888 --> 13:35.408
We found another piece of this...
I don't know, shiny string.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.238
<i>- I was afraid of that.</i>
- Why? What's up?

13:38.661 --> 13:41.351
Well, these so-called accidents,
we're seeing them nationwide.

13:41.897 --> 13:43.237
About 75 so far.

13:43.599 --> 13:46.059
I got Jo and her crew working
on a cluster in California.

13:46.568 --> 13:47.618
Hey. Hey. Hey.

13:47.970 --> 13:48.900
<i>Blood relatives?</i>

13:49.204 --> 13:51.014
Some yeah, some no.

13:51.473 --> 13:52.673
She's got about what you do.

13:53.008 --> 13:54.758
Pile of bodies
and a bunch of gold thread.

13:55.177 --> 13:56.847
- So, what's it mean?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

13:57.246 --> 13:58.826
I got Bobby working on it right now.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.393
How's he doing, by the way?

14:02.751 --> 14:05.791
Oh, don't worry. I'm kicking his ass
back to health and happiness.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.848
Who asked you to? To hell with you.

14:09.358 --> 14:10.588
<i>I heard that.</i>

14:10.926 --> 14:11.886
He'll be okay.

14:13.028 --> 14:15.168
- Are you okay?
<i>- Oh, honey, you're sweet.</i>

14:15.631 --> 14:17.941
<i>You know me.
I just worry about you boys.</i>

14:18.434 --> 14:19.394
Yeah, well...

14:20.102 --> 14:22.032
So all these corpses,
anything relate them?

14:22.805 --> 14:24.615
Well, actually, I did dig up one thing.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.120
- I just don't know what to make of it.
<i>- Hit me.</i>

14:27.576 --> 14:29.656
Well, it's a weird one.
It was buried pretty deep.

14:30.112 --> 14:33.512
But Bobby and me were combing through
the family trees on all the victims...

14:34.149 --> 14:35.579
and we started seeing...

14:36.452 --> 14:39.262
<i>Well, the families all came over
to America the same year.</i>

14:39.822 --> 14:42.752
1912. Here's the real weird part.
They all came over on the same boat.

14:43.325 --> 14:44.695
- Really?
<i>- Yep.</i>

14:46.628 --> 14:48.358
- What's special about the boat?
- Nothing.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.544
It was a boat. It did what boats do.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.696
What was it called?

14:53.068 --> 14:55.178
The <i>Titanic. </i> Did you ever hear of it?

14:56.271 --> 14:57.911
- No.
<i>- Yeah, me neither.</i>

14:59.408 --> 15:01.368
- I'll keep digging.
<i>- All right.</i>

15:05.848 --> 15:07.518
Does the name <i>Titanic </i> ring a bell?

15:07.916 --> 15:09.406
<i>Titanic?</i>

15:12.087 --> 15:13.017
No.

15:18.327 --> 15:21.367
"The <i>RMS Titanic </i> was the largest
passenger steamship in the world...

15:21.964 --> 15:25.594
when it made its maiden voyage
across the North Atlantic in 1912."

15:26.268 --> 15:28.078
What's the big deal?
It's a ship, it sailed.

15:29.271 --> 15:30.881
Yeah, I don't know.

15:32.474 --> 15:33.934
Looks like there was a close call.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.479
Ship almost hit an iceberg.

15:35.811 --> 15:37.271
Almost? So?

15:37.646 --> 15:38.986
So...

15:39.348 --> 15:41.428
Uh, looks like the first mate spotted it
just in time.

15:42.684 --> 15:45.114
Good for him. There anything else?

15:46.088 --> 15:47.838
- Wait a second.
- What?

15:48.724 --> 15:49.684
Uh, this first mate...

15:50.359 --> 15:52.109
Mr. I.P. Freeley.

15:53.829 --> 15:57.369
Well, that's not suspicious.
You got a picture of old Freeley?

16:02.671 --> 16:04.251
You gotta be kidding me.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.587
Let's see.

16:11.814 --> 16:12.834
Balthazar.

16:27.996 --> 16:29.606
Boys, boys, boys.

16:29.998 --> 16:32.628
- Whatever can I do for you?
- We need to talk.

16:33.735 --> 16:36.455
- Well, you seem upset, Dean.
- The hell with the boat, Balthazar.

16:37.005 --> 16:38.645
- What boat?
- The <i>Titanic.</i>

16:39.041 --> 16:41.381
Oh, yeah. The <i>Titanic.</i>

16:41.877 --> 16:44.687
Yes, well, uh, it was meant to sink,
and I saved it.

16:46.849 --> 16:48.689
- What?
- It was meant to bash...

16:49.151 --> 16:51.701
into this iceberg thing
and plunge into the briny deep...

16:52.221 --> 16:55.441
with all this hoopla, and I saved it.
Anything else I can answer for you?

16:56.792 --> 16:58.052
- Why?
- Why what?

16:58.393 --> 16:59.763
Why did you unsink the ship?

17:00.162 --> 17:01.802
Oh, because I hated the movie.

17:02.197 --> 17:04.686
- What movie?
- Exactly. Ha-ha-ha.

17:05.701 --> 17:08.221
Wait, so you saved a cruise liner
because...

17:08.737 --> 17:11.696
Because that god-awful Celine Dion song
made me wanna smite myself.

17:12.273 --> 17:13.534
Who's Celine Dion?

17:13.876 --> 17:15.656
She's a destitute lounge singer
in Quebec.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.328
And let's keep it that way, please.

17:18.814 --> 17:21.973
I didn't think that was possible.
I thought you couldn't change history.

17:22.584 --> 17:23.513
Haven't you noticed?

17:23.819 --> 17:25.108
There's no more rules, boys.

17:27.823 --> 17:29.083
Wow.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.445
The nerve on you.

17:31.827 --> 17:34.287
So you just...
What, unsunk a giant boat?

17:34.796 --> 17:37.696
Oh, come on, I saved people.
I thought you loved that kind of thing.

17:38.267 --> 17:41.197
Yeah, but now those people
and their kids and their kids' kids...

17:41.770 --> 17:43.940
They must have interacted
with so many people...

17:44.406 --> 17:46.106
changed so much crap.

17:46.508 --> 17:48.818
- You totally <i>Butterfly Effect-ed </i> history.
- Dude, dude.

17:49.311 --> 17:51.971
Rule one: No Kutcher references.

17:52.514 --> 17:54.094
Yes, there's still an Ashton Kutcher.

17:54.483 --> 17:57.413
And you still averted the apocalypse,
and there are still archangels.

17:57.986 --> 18:00.176
It's just the small details
that are different.

18:00.656 --> 18:02.646
Like you don't drive an Impala.

18:04.459 --> 18:07.999
Yes, yes. "What's an Impala?"
Trust me, it's not important.

18:08.664 --> 18:11.274
And, of course, Ellen and Jo are alive.

18:11.800 --> 18:12.880
Ellen and Jo? What?

18:13.769 --> 18:15.169
Yes, they're supposed to be dead.

18:16.038 --> 18:19.408
You see, I save a boat,
one thing leads to another...

18:20.042 --> 18:22.672
which leads to another
thousand things, yadda, yadda, yadda.

18:23.245 --> 18:25.675
Long story short,
they don't die in a massive explosion.

18:29.384 --> 18:31.254
Anyway,
let's agree I did a good thing.

18:31.687 --> 18:34.877
One less Billy Zane movie,
and I saved two of your closest friends.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.740
But now somebody is killing
the descendants of the survivors.

18:40.462 --> 18:41.392
And?

18:42.531 --> 18:45.751
And that's maybe,
like, 50,000 people.

18:47.536 --> 18:49.876
- And?
- We need to save as many as we can...

18:50.372 --> 18:52.102
but we need to know
who's after them.

18:52.507 --> 18:54.997
Sorry. You have me confused
with the other angel.

18:55.510 --> 18:58.500
You know, the one in the dirty
trench coat who's in love with you.

18:59.147 --> 19:00.077
I don't care.

19:03.652 --> 19:05.522
- Goodbye, boys.
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:06.722 --> 19:08.502
Son of a bitch.

19:09.558 --> 19:13.398
Balthazar unsank a boat,
now we got a boatload of people...

19:14.096 --> 19:15.556
<i>who should never have been born.</i>

19:15.931 --> 19:18.651
- Yeah. Like 50,000.
<i>- Makes sense.</i>

19:20.068 --> 19:23.168
- How does any of this make sense?
- I got an idea who we're up against.

19:23.805 --> 19:26.025
- What?
<i>- Fate.</i>

19:26.541 --> 19:27.471
You mean...?

19:27.809 --> 19:29.119
I mean Fate, like the Fates.

19:29.811 --> 19:32.121
Or one of them, at least.

19:32.814 --> 19:35.124
You mean like Greek mythology?
Like the sisters?

19:35.617 --> 19:37.347
<i>- Bingo.</i>
- Nerd.

19:37.753 --> 19:40.333
<i>These ladies are responsible
for how you go down.</i>

19:40.856 --> 19:44.456
Literally. So if you get creamed
by a garage door...

19:45.127 --> 19:46.587
or crunched by a copy machine...

19:46.962 --> 19:49.592
they're the ones who hammer out
the details of how you die.

19:50.132 --> 19:51.362
<i>Spin out your fate...</i>

19:51.700 --> 19:55.420
<i>- on a piece of pure gold.</i>
- Gold thread.

19:57.339 --> 20:00.359
And then one of them writes it all down
in her day runner of death.

20:00.942 --> 20:02.782
<i>High-level stuff.</i>

20:03.211 --> 20:06.611
<i>Anyway, fits.
Now we know what Balthazar did.</i>

20:07.249 --> 20:11.029
It seems to me that maybe Fate
is just trying to clean up the mess.

20:12.421 --> 20:14.061
So how do we stop it?

20:14.990 --> 20:18.010
- How do we stop Fate? Good question.
- Well, there's gotta be a way.

20:18.593 --> 20:21.023
Or there ain't.
This is Fate we're talking about here.

20:22.164 --> 20:25.474
You know, the easiest way would be
to get that angel to re-sink the boat.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.681
No. No way. Forget it.

20:28.070 --> 20:31.090
Big difference between dying awful
and never being born, Dean.

20:31.673 --> 20:33.423
We are not sinking the boat, Bobby.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.985
<i>- Okay? Don't even think about it.</i>
- Well, okay.

20:36.445 --> 20:38.055
What's got your panties in a clench?

20:39.748 --> 20:41.118
Nothing.

20:41.483 --> 20:42.503
Try that again?

20:44.786 --> 20:45.986
It...

20:46.922 --> 20:49.172
Look, it doesn't even really matter,
but...

20:50.492 --> 20:51.892
<i>But?</i>

20:54.796 --> 20:58.196
Apparently,
a crapload of dominoes get tipped over...

20:58.834 --> 21:00.264
if the <i>Titanic </i> goes down.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.883
And, uh, bottom line...

21:05.974 --> 21:07.314
Ellen and Jo die.

21:26.795 --> 21:28.465
Okay, you two, listen up.

21:29.564 --> 21:31.674
<i>You make sure.</i>

21:32.134 --> 21:34.384
Keep those angels
from sinking that boat.

21:34.870 --> 21:36.070
- You understand me?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

21:36.438 --> 21:38.628
<i>- Yes.
- Yeah, Bobby, of course.</i>

21:48.683 --> 21:51.813
He's bad enough with her.
Think how he'd be if she was gone.

21:52.454 --> 21:53.714
Yeah.

21:55.757 --> 21:57.367
So, what do we do?

21:59.361 --> 22:01.821
I mean,
how do we save 50,000 people?

22:02.330 --> 22:03.790
I got no freaking clue.

22:04.166 --> 22:05.476
Yeah.

22:05.901 --> 22:07.631
We don't even know who they are.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.600
Well, we know one.

22:24.119 --> 22:25.079
That's him.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.817
Let's go.

22:32.294 --> 22:34.724
- Hello. Yeah. What?
- Mr. Russo!

22:35.230 --> 22:36.720
I don't care. Send him a fruitcake.

22:43.505 --> 22:45.205
- Shawn!
- Who's the judge?

22:45.607 --> 22:46.717
Russo!

22:47.042 --> 22:48.562
Send him a nice bottle of champagne.

22:48.944 --> 22:50.674
- But nothing more than thir... No.
- Shawn!

22:51.079 --> 22:52.659
Twenty bucks.
This guy, he owes me...

22:54.449 --> 22:55.619
Russo, stop!

23:03.225 --> 23:05.155
- Did you see that?
- Is he okay?

23:05.594 --> 23:06.674
Get off of me.

23:07.028 --> 23:09.018
And you.
I told you to leave me alone, didn't I?

23:09.464 --> 23:12.534
- We're just trying to help you out.
- You almost killed me, you lunatic.

23:13.134 --> 23:14.834
Give me that. Unbelievable.

23:15.537 --> 23:17.847
- Russo. Hey.
- Just be glad I'm not suing your ass.

23:31.111 --> 23:33.011
You've got to be kidding me.

23:38.118 --> 23:40.078
Sam, check it out.

23:40.554 --> 23:41.484
What?

23:46.426 --> 23:47.626
- Too soon?
- Yeah, Dean.

23:47.961 --> 23:51.001
I'm pretty sure
six seconds is too soon.

24:03.977 --> 24:05.177
Hey, hey, hey.

24:06.013 --> 24:07.033
I think I saw her.

24:07.347 --> 24:08.517
Right over there.

24:08.849 --> 24:09.839
Her? Like, Fate her?

24:10.150 --> 24:11.730
- Yeah.
- What did she look like?

24:13.120 --> 24:14.350
Kind of like a librarian.

24:16.223 --> 24:18.853
Your kind of librarian
or my kind of librarian?

24:20.160 --> 24:22.530
Well, she was wearing clothes,
if that's what you mean.

24:23.030 --> 24:24.230
- All right.
- Wait, wait.

24:24.598 --> 24:25.858
We can't just walk over there.

24:26.199 --> 24:28.829
We're not on the hit list.
We have nothing to do with the boat.

24:29.369 --> 24:30.659
- Let's go talk to her.
- Talk?

24:31.004 --> 24:32.434
Yeah. You know?

24:33.707 --> 24:35.757
Talk. Worth a shot, right?

24:45.752 --> 24:47.212
Hello?

25:51.218 --> 25:52.588
Hello?

25:59.726 --> 26:00.656
Oh, come on.

26:00.961 --> 26:03.361
- You got a lighter?
- Yeah.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.017
- It's out of juice or something?
- It shouldn't be.

26:27.821 --> 26:29.021
Cass.

26:29.356 --> 26:31.756
- Hello, Dean. Sam.
- Hey. Thanks, man.

26:32.959 --> 26:33.889
Where are we?

26:34.227 --> 26:35.217
White Russia.

26:35.996 --> 26:37.286
What?

26:40.367 --> 26:42.117
Are you aware
of what your frat bro did?

26:43.537 --> 26:45.677
I'm aware.
Balthazar can be impetuous.

26:46.139 --> 26:47.069
Well, riddle me this.

26:47.374 --> 26:50.884
If Fate's going after the boat people,
why'd she try to waste me and Sam?

26:51.545 --> 26:54.175
I imagine she harbors
a certain degree of rage toward you.

26:54.748 --> 26:56.148
What did we do?

26:56.616 --> 26:58.806
Nothing of import.
Just the tiny matter...

26:59.286 --> 27:02.326
of averting the apocalypse
and rendering her obsolete.

27:03.156 --> 27:05.326
I think maybe she's a little irritated
about that.

27:06.259 --> 27:08.779
And then you go
and dangle yourselves in front of her.

27:09.296 --> 27:11.636
So we've pissed Fate off personally.

27:12.132 --> 27:15.672
If I know her, and I do,
she won't stop until you're dead.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.204
Awesome.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.026
So, what do we do?

27:21.341 --> 27:22.391
Kill her.

27:25.345 --> 27:26.715
Kill Fate?

27:27.781 --> 27:29.651
Do you have another suggestion?

27:30.083 --> 27:31.783
No, I'm... I just mean...

27:32.185 --> 27:34.435
- Can you even do that?
- Balthazar has a weapon...

27:34.921 --> 27:36.731
- that will work against her.
- Of course.

27:37.157 --> 27:39.737
That guy has just got it covered.
You need new friends, Cass.

27:40.861 --> 27:43.031
I'm trying to save the ones I have,
Dean.

27:47.067 --> 27:48.237
We'll have to draw her out.

27:49.402 --> 27:53.352
All right, well, uh, she's gunning for us.
She's bound to surface again eventually.

27:55.509 --> 27:57.209
We'll make it easy for her.

27:57.611 --> 27:59.751
I think you have an expression for it.

28:00.347 --> 28:01.367
Tempting fate?

28:06.086 --> 28:08.076
Yeah, well, you just be careful.

28:10.924 --> 28:13.734
That was Jo.
Thirty more dead on the West Coast.

28:14.327 --> 28:17.047
What exactly do those boys think
they're gonna do?

28:18.765 --> 28:19.965
It's the boys.

28:20.333 --> 28:22.913
If anybody can pull this out of their ass,
it's those two.

28:23.436 --> 28:26.306
Yeah, you ever heard the saying
you can't stop fate?

28:27.641 --> 28:30.571
You know, cleanest fix
would just be to sink the boat.

28:31.611 --> 28:34.191
- Why would you say that?
- Right now they're all dying bloody.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.324
It's not the same
as never being born.

28:38.218 --> 28:40.178
You're talking about people.

28:40.954 --> 28:41.914
People who are loved.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.320
Who would be missed.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.326
What the hell is up with you?

28:52.065 --> 28:53.375
Nothing.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.193
Oh, please.

28:55.569 --> 28:57.179
You are a neon sign.

29:03.243 --> 29:06.703
So I can beat it out of you or we could
just skip that part. Dealer's choice.

29:19.092 --> 29:21.022
So not just me, but Jo too?

29:27.400 --> 29:29.800
They're not gonna sink the boat.
I promise.

29:31.905 --> 29:34.125
The boat stays.
You don't have to worry.

29:36.176 --> 29:37.516
Well...

29:38.211 --> 29:40.461
If it was meant to be, then...

29:41.014 --> 29:43.324
- I guess whatever happens happens.
- That's my point.

29:43.817 --> 29:45.457
Nothing's meant to be.

29:45.852 --> 29:48.132
Whether we're together
is at the whim of some angel.

29:48.622 --> 29:49.992
Oh, Bobby, relax.

29:50.357 --> 29:51.527
I can't.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.910
We need you.

29:57.731 --> 29:59.311
Especially me.

30:02.435 --> 30:03.365
I know.

30:18.585 --> 30:21.455
Okay, so we're just gonna meet our fate
at any time, right?

30:22.022 --> 30:23.072
Yeah.

30:23.390 --> 30:24.590
Just walk. Act natural.

30:24.958 --> 30:26.098
Hey! Hey!

30:35.368 --> 30:36.978
- Okay.
- Yeah. It's fine.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.310
Okay.

31:08.134 --> 31:10.324
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

31:15.141 --> 31:16.371
All right, just...

31:16.710 --> 31:18.080
Keep walking.

31:26.453 --> 31:27.743
Sam, they're juggling knives.

31:28.088 --> 31:29.288
- And hatchets.
- Yeah, I know.

31:36.596 --> 31:37.526
You can't avoid fate.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.112
Ah!

32:02.055 --> 32:03.165
All right. I don't get it.

32:03.490 --> 32:06.240
I don't either. Who do you gotta kill
to get killed around here?

32:06.793 --> 32:08.023
Maybe Cass was wrong.

32:08.361 --> 32:09.471
Look out!

32:34.154 --> 32:35.794
Castiel.

32:40.226 --> 32:41.926
Atropos.

32:43.463 --> 32:45.513
- You look well.
- I look like stomped-over crap...

32:45.965 --> 32:47.275
because of you.

32:47.667 --> 32:50.247
- All right, let's talk about this.
- Talk? About what?

32:51.271 --> 32:54.201
Maybe about how you and those
two circus clowns destroyed my work.

32:54.774 --> 32:57.384
- You ruined my life.
- Let's not get emotional.

32:57.911 --> 32:59.201
Not get emotional?

32:59.546 --> 33:02.236
I had a job. God gave me a job.

33:02.782 --> 33:04.682
We all had a script.

33:05.118 --> 33:06.258
I worked hard.

33:06.586 --> 33:11.446
I was really, really good at what I did.
Until the day of the big prizefight.

33:12.759 --> 33:13.779
And then what happens?

33:14.093 --> 33:15.143
You throw out the book.

33:15.829 --> 33:19.199
Well, I'm sorry,
but freedom is more preferable.

33:19.833 --> 33:22.873
Freedom?
This is chaos. How is it better?

33:24.003 --> 33:25.143
I even went to heaven...

33:25.471 --> 33:28.511
to ask what to do next. Know what?
No one would even talk to me.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.778
There are more pressing matters
at hand.

33:31.211 --> 33:32.941
But I don't know what happens next.

33:33.346 --> 33:34.896
I need to know. It's what I do.

33:35.281 --> 33:36.451
I'm sorry.

33:37.350 --> 33:39.310
But your services
are no longer required.

33:43.590 --> 33:45.200
You know what?

33:45.859 --> 33:47.089
I've kept my mouth shut.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.750
I could've complained,
I could've raised a fuss.

33:50.230 --> 33:54.070
But I didn't.
But you know what the last straw is?

33:55.101 --> 33:56.591
Unsinking the <i>Titanic.</i>

33:56.970 --> 33:59.370
You changed the future.
You cannot change the past.

33:59.873 --> 34:02.153
- That is going too far.
- It's Balthazar. He's erratic.

34:02.642 --> 34:03.872
Bullcrap.

34:04.244 --> 34:06.264
This isn't about some stupid movie.

34:06.746 --> 34:08.235
He's under your orders.

34:08.882 --> 34:11.572
You sent him back to save that ship.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.478
No, I didn't.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.014
Why would I?

34:16.322 --> 34:19.282
Oh, maybe because you're in the middle
of a war and you're desperate.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.504
Come on. This is about the souls.

34:24.864 --> 34:26.764
You don't know
what you're talking about.

34:27.199 --> 34:31.889
That angel went and created
50,000 new souls for your war machine.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.542
You're confused.

34:34.908 --> 34:36.217
No.

34:36.876 --> 34:38.896
You can't just mint money, Castiel.

34:40.045 --> 34:41.386
It's wrong.

34:41.781 --> 34:42.981
It's dangerous.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.626
And I won't let you.

34:50.723 --> 34:51.833
You don't have a choice.

34:52.158 --> 34:53.618
Maybe I don't.

34:53.993 --> 34:55.483
So here's a choice for you.

34:55.862 --> 34:58.112
If you don't go back
and sink that boat...

34:59.532 --> 35:02.082
I'm gonna kill
your two favorite pets.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.064
I won't let you.

35:06.372 --> 35:09.392
- Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?
- Do you really wanna test me?

35:13.313 --> 35:14.833
Okay, fine.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.944
But think about this:

35:17.350 --> 35:20.010
I've got two sisters out there.
They're bigger.

35:20.553 --> 35:22.423
In every sense of the word.

35:22.855 --> 35:24.225
Kill me...

35:24.590 --> 35:26.050
Sam and Dean are target one.

35:26.893 --> 35:28.353
For simple vengeance.

35:31.631 --> 35:33.651
You're not fighting a war or anything,
right?

35:34.100 --> 35:36.560
You can watch them
every millisecond of every day.

35:37.070 --> 35:39.440
Because maybe you've heard...

35:39.939 --> 35:42.979
fate strikes
when you least expect it.

35:44.944 --> 35:45.904
Balthazar, stop.

35:47.814 --> 35:50.154
Uh... Awkward. Heh.

35:51.718 --> 35:54.208
Set things right
before I flick your boys off a cliff...

35:54.721 --> 35:55.891
just on principle.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.772
Sweetie, before we go, um,
I could remove that stick from your...

35:59.292 --> 36:00.872
Don't try me.

36:02.061 --> 36:03.371
We'll leave it inserted, then.

36:07.367 --> 36:09.147
All right, then.

36:09.869 --> 36:12.329
Let's sink the <i>Titanic.</i>

36:24.309 --> 36:26.359
<i>You're here</i>

36:26.811 --> 36:30.381
<i>There's nothing I fear</i>

36:31.049 --> 36:35.909
<i>And I know that my heart will</i>

36:36.755 --> 36:37.655
<i>Go on</i>

36:53.304 --> 36:55.054
Dude, what time is it?

36:56.474 --> 36:59.284
I just had the weirdest dream.

36:59.844 --> 37:01.864
Twenty bucks says mine was weirder.
Not kidding.

37:02.313 --> 37:05.093
No, no. I'm not kidding either.
I mean, it was...

37:06.217 --> 37:07.147
just bizarre.

37:07.452 --> 37:10.002
Mine had the actual <i>Titanic </i> in it.

37:11.523 --> 37:12.953
What?

37:13.745 --> 37:15.411
Something on my face?

37:17.081 --> 37:18.314
D... did it, uh...

37:18.817 --> 37:19.917
not sink,

37:20.485 --> 37:21.719
because Balthazar...

37:21.786 --> 37:23.020
Had a hate on for Billy Zane?

37:24.523 --> 37:26.156
Why are you
having my dreams, dude?

37:26.224 --> 37:28.425
Wasn't a dream.

37:29.661 --> 37:30.895
Wait, what?

37:32.831 --> 37:34.632
You're saying
this actually happened?

37:34.699 --> 37:37.167
That t... the whole...
whatever... t... that was real?

37:37.735 --> 37:39.302
Yes.

37:40.370 --> 37:41.372
So, what happened?

37:42.439 --> 37:44.108
Well, I insisted
he go back in time

37:44.175 --> 37:45.643
and correct what he'd done.

37:45.710 --> 37:46.744
What?

37:47.811 --> 37:48.443
Why?

37:48.446 --> 37:50.814
It was the only way
to be sure you were safe.

37:54.652 --> 37:55.685
So...

37:55.753 --> 37:57.821
so, you killed...

37:57.889 --> 37:59.990
50,000 people for us.

38:02.827 --> 38:05.896
No, I didn't.
They were never born.

38:08.466 --> 38:11.134
That's far different from being killed,
wouldn't you say?

38:17.108 --> 38:18.642
Ellen and Jo?

38:25.083 --> 38:26.483
I'm sorry.

38:31.856 --> 38:33.290
Hold on.

38:33.357 --> 38:35.592
Uh...

38:35.660 --> 38:40.564
So, if you guys went
a-and changed everything back,

38:40.631 --> 38:44.601
then that whole timeline
or whatever, it just got erased?

38:44.669 --> 38:47.003
Yeah. More or less.

38:47.071 --> 38:49.473
Well, then, how come
he and I remember it?

38:49.540 --> 38:51.908
Because I wanted you
to remember it.

38:51.976 --> 38:53.810
Why?

38:53.878 --> 38:56.513
I wanted you to know
who fate really is.

38:56.581 --> 38:58.582
She's cruel and capricious.

38:58.649 --> 39:00.250
I'd go so far as "bitch."

39:00.318 --> 39:01.418
Well, yeah.

39:01.486 --> 39:04.054
You're the ones who taught me

39:04.122 --> 39:07.390
that you can make
your own destiny.

39:07.458 --> 39:10.093
You don't have to be ruled
by fate.

39:10.161 --> 39:13.263
You can choose freedom.

39:13.331 --> 39:16.366
I still believe that that's
something worth fighting for.

39:18.603 --> 39:20.637
I just wanted you
to understand that.

39:24.442 --> 39:26.109
So, wait.

39:26.177 --> 39:30.180
Did... Balthazar really, uh,

39:30.248 --> 39:32.215
unravel the sweater
over a chick flick?

39:33.951 --> 39:35.418
Yes.

39:35.486 --> 39:37.454
Absolutely. That's what he did.

39:37.522 --> 39:40.457
Wow. Well, might be time to
take away his cable privileges.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.627
<i>Besides, "Titanic"
didn't suck that bad.</i>

39:45.396 --> 39:46.730
Winslet's rack.

39:51.035 --> 39:52.836
I'll tell you
one thing about Cass,

39:52.904 --> 39:54.571
he does not appreciate
the finer things.

40:08.486 --> 40:11.521
I guess things
are back to normal, huh?

40:11.589 --> 40:14.124
"Normal." Awesome.

40:15.326 --> 40:18.161
Poor bastard.

40:18.229 --> 40:20.530
Doesn't even know
how good he had it.

40:20.598 --> 40:22.732
Yeah, well, what he doesn't know
won't hurt him.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.167
I say we keep our mouths shut.

40:24.235 --> 40:26.303
Yeah. I'm with you.

40:26.370 --> 40:28.171
Should we wake him?

40:28.239 --> 40:30.207
Nah.

40:30.274 --> 40:34.110
That's probably
the best he's felt all week.
