favorite.
>> KHLOE: Yeah, and Kim's not

00:12.200 --> 00:14.066

>> KRIS: It sounds like you two

00:14.066 --> 00:16.433
are a little jelly.
>> KHLOE: Kiss ass.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.433

Yiddish's, like, a different
version of Hebrew.

another one, or we're gonna lose

08:27.266 --> 08:29.700
our surrogate.
>> KOURTNEY: Really?

08:29.700 --> 08:32.233
>> KIM: Mm-hmm.
Kanye and I have always talked

08:32.233 --> 08:35.300
about having more kids, but I've
gone through so much with really

08:35.300 --> 08:38.967
bad deliveries that the doctors
don't feel like it's safe for me

08:38.967 --> 08:42.000
to carry my own baby.
>> CRANE: You had toxemia, you

08:42.000 --> 08:44.567
had a retained placenta.
Very traumatic.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.266
>> KIM: The doctor is like, "For
sure now, you should not carry

08:47.266 --> 08:49.800
another baby."
Kanye and I are just gonna,

08:49.800 --> 08:52.066
like, look into other options
and see what we're comfortable

08:52.066 --> 08:54.300
with.
But getting a surrogate and

08:54.300 --> 08:58.734
finding someone that you really
trust really is so much more

08:58.734 --> 09:03.200
difficult of a situation than
you could really imagine.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.166
You have to, like, make sure
that their lifestyle is healthy,

09:06.166 --> 09:09.367
and they have to go through
psychological testing.

09:09.367 --> 09:12.667
And it was, like, maybe a year
before we actually finalized our

09:12.667 --> 09:15.700
current situation.
But I think everything happens

09:15.700 --> 09:18.934
for a reason, because the
surrogate that I really love got

09:18.934 --> 09:22.000
approved.
And she's such a nice person.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.533
Like, she's so easy to talk to.
And she's the perfect fit for

09:25.533 --> 09:28.266
us.
But we have to decide quickly,

09:28.266 --> 09:31.066
are we really gonna go through
with this or are we gonna wait

09:31.066 --> 09:35.233
until we feel more prepared.

We don't have to be quiet about

27:03.500 --> 27:05.500
>> KIM: Well, I'll go on a group
thing.

27:05.500 --> 27:11.066
It'll just be, like, a chill
barbecue at, like, my house.

27:11.066 --> 27:14.266
>> KOURTNEY: Um, I'm really busy
this week, I have a lot going

27:14.266 --> 27:16.266
on.
>> KHLOE: But...

27:16.266 --> 27:18.266
>> KIM: But we noticed you were
out with a certain someone.

27:18.266 --> 27:21.000
>> KHLOE: So that's your
boyfriend?

27:21.000 --> 27:25.900
>> KOURTNEY: Um...
>> KHLOE: So, you just hang out

27:25.900 --> 27:30.700
with this guy, but you won't
validate anything to us?

27:30.700 --> 27:36.033
>> KIM: That's weird.
She fully does not go for it.

27:36.033 --> 27:38.033
So she definitely has a
boyfriend.

27:38.033 --> 27:41.633
>> KHLOE: She's so weird.
>> KOURTNEY: This is your best

27:41.633 --> 27:47.066
angle, Kim.
>> KIM: Look at that chin.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.233
>> KHLOE: Ew, why the tongue
thing, though?

27:49.233 --> 27:51.333
>> KIM: Can't really see with
this light.

27:51.333 --> 27:57.600
My girl.
(high-pitched laughing)

27:57.600 --> 28:00.333
>> KYLIE: Oh, my goodness.
Hot tamale.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.333
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.
It's like 106.

28:02.333 --> 28:04.333
I don't get it.
>> KYLIE: This is, like, not a

28:04.333 --> 28:07.800
good outfit.
>> KHLOE: You and me both,

28:07.800 --> 28:11.133
sister.
Oh.

28:11.133 --> 28:14.000
Hello?
Ooh, air conditioning.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.166
>> KYLIE: Mmm.
>> KHLOE: And marble floors.

28:17.166 --> 28:19.700
>> KYLIE: Hello?
>> KHLOE: Keekaleek.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.266
>> KIM: Hi, guys.
>> KYLIE: Is this for me?

28:22.266 --> 28:24.834
>> KIM: Are you hungry?
>> KHLOE: Oh, kiss ass.

28:24.834 --> 28:26.834
>> KYLIE: Which one's mine?
>> KIM: You want the larger one?

28:26.834 --> 28:28.834
I don't know...
>> KHLOE: Do you leave this out

28:28.834 --> 28:30.834
to taunt me?
Look at this (bleep).

28:30.834 --> 28:32.834
>> KIM: It's a (bleep) blender.
She said she wanted it.

28:32.834 --> 28:34.834
>> KHLOE: Right, you're a kiss
ass, 'cause she said this is her

28:34.834 --> 28:38.633
favorite thing.
You little sneaky snake.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.633
Now you're gonna do a blender.
You're trying to...

28:40.633 --> 28:42.633
>> KIM: I just saw it, and so I
was like, "Fine, I'll just get

28:42.633 --> 28:44.633
it."
>> KHLOE: Oh, when you just see

28:44.633 --> 28:46.633
some diamond earrings, you
should just get them for me,

28:46.633 --> 28:48.633
too.
>> KIM: Okay.

28:48.633 --> 28:51.400
I'll remember that.
>> KHLOE: Bitch.

28:51.400 --> 28:54.100
I see what you're doing.
She's buying Mom's affection.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.166
After the toaster you got her,
she's now buying her the

28:56.166 --> 28:58.533
matching blender.
>> KYLIE: What toaster?

28:58.533 --> 29:00.533
>> KHLOE: The toaster you got
her.

29:00.533 --> 29:02.967
>> KIM: That toaster that she's
been dying for, and you're like

29:02.967 --> 29:06.266
her favorite daughter 'cause you
got her that toaster.

29:06.266 --> 29:09.700
>> KYLIE: I didn't get her a
toaster.

29:09.700 --> 29:11.700
I'm sorry, I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.700
>> KHLOE: She also said that you
took her to get a massage.

29:13.700 --> 29:17.033
>> KYLIE: No, I don't even get
massages.

29:17.033 --> 29:19.900
>> KIM: She's a pathological
liar.

29:19.900 --> 29:22.066
>> KHLOE: Why would you lie
about that?

29:22.066 --> 29:24.233
>> KIM: I think it's to get us
to buy her other stuff.

29:24.233 --> 29:26.333
>> KHLOE: No, there's no way
someone would do that.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.934
>> KYLIE: She's, like,
manipulating you guys, I think.

29:28.934 --> 29:33.066
>> KIM: She really is.
>> KHLOE: She's really a snake.

29:33.066 --> 29:36.600
I feel pissed that I didn't see
this before, like, Kim and I

29:36.600 --> 29:40.934
were so consumed in one-upping
each other that we didn't even

29:40.934 --> 29:43.633
see that my mom is the one that
is, like, manipulating us the

29:43.633 --> 29:46.066
entire time.
>> KIM: We should, like, somehow

29:46.066 --> 29:48.900
get her back.
>> KHLOE: Yeah, how dare she lie

29:48.900 --> 29:53.734
to us?
That's (bleep) up.

29:53.734 --> 29:57.834
>> KIM: We wanted to truly thank
you.

29:57.834 --> 30:00.233
>> KRIS: For what?
>> KHLOE: For just being you.

30:00.233 --> 30:04.200
>> KRIS: Is that cake?
>> KHLOE: Hold on, it's coming.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.834
>> KIM: Are you by yourself?
>> KHLOE: I'm by myself.

30:06.834 --> 30:15.100
>> KIM: So, guess what?
>> KHLOE: I'm afraid. What?

30:15.100 --> 30:17.000
♪ ♪

30:21.100 --> 30:24.600
>> KIM: This is so (bleep) good.
>> KHLOE: Don't try to eat the

30:24.600 --> 30:27.033
other one.
>> KIM: I know.

30:27.033 --> 30:30.834
>> KHLOE: Where is Mom?
Mom!

30:30.834 --> 30:33.600
>> KRIS: Yeah?
>> KIM: Put the sticks both in

30:33.600 --> 30:36.900
the other one.
>> KRIS: Yeah?

30:36.900 --> 30:39.567
>> KHLOE: How are you?
>> KRIS: I'm good.

30:39.567 --> 30:41.800
Is that cake?
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.

30:41.800 --> 30:46.300
Hold on, it's coming.
>> KIM: We wanted to truly thank

30:46.300 --> 30:49.300
you.
>> KRIS: For what?

30:49.300 --> 30:51.867
>> KHLOE: For just being you.
>> KRIS: Aw.

30:51.867 --> 30:53.867
>> KHLOE: Yeah.
>> KRIS: That's my favorite

30:53.867 --> 30:56.000
cake.
>> KHLOE: I know.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.133
>> KRIS: I love that cake.
>> KIM: Give me a hug.

30:59.133 --> 31:02.600
>> KRIS: Okay. What's wrong?
Why do you want to hug me?

31:02.600 --> 31:06.400
Huh? What?
What are you doing?

31:06.400 --> 31:10.400
Khloe, what is wrong?!
What is wrong with you?!

31:10.400 --> 31:13.400
What the hell are you doing?!
>> KHLOE: Read this sweet

31:13.400 --> 31:16.367
message.
>> KRIS: "How does payback

31:16.367 --> 31:19.367
taste? Sweet revenge."
What did I do to des...

31:19.367 --> 31:21.633
>> KHLOE: You've been
manipulating all of us and

31:21.633 --> 31:24.033
using your daughters to buy you
(bleep).

31:24.033 --> 31:26.266
>> KIM: Yes!
>> KHLOE: Are you crazy?

31:26.266 --> 31:28.567
>> KRIS: Are you crazy?
>> KIM: I talked to Kylie, and

31:28.567 --> 31:30.734
she did not get you that
toaster, so you fully scammed

31:30.734 --> 31:33.066
us.
>> KRIS: If that's what it takes

31:33.066 --> 31:36.667
for me to get you guys to be
nice to me, at least I'm smart

31:36.667 --> 31:39.600
enough to figure that out.
>> KIM: And you're teaching us

31:39.600 --> 31:43.800
bribing, lying, scamming...
>> KRIS: They're life lessons.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.533
Don't ever forget.
>> KIM: No, now you can buy a

31:46.533 --> 31:49.400
mop.
>> KHLOE: Buy your (bleep) self

31:49.400 --> 31:52.266
a Hansen's cake.
You don't even deserve this one.

31:52.266 --> 31:56.467
>> KRIS: What? What? Khloe!
Oh, my God!

31:56.467 --> 31:59.667
>> KHLOE: This will show her not
to mess with us again.

31:59.667 --> 32:02.266
Or you're gonna get two cakes to
the face, Kris.

32:02.266 --> 32:04.433
>> KRIS: This is bad behavior.
>> KHLOE: We're big and we're

32:04.433 --> 32:08.600
bad.
And we're hungry.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.767
>> KHLOE: This is the best part,
if you want a piece.

32:10.767 --> 32:12.800
>> KRIS: No. I don't want a
piece.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.000
I have (bleep) cake up my
nostrils.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.033
You guys are both grounded.
>> KHLOE: You're a scam artist.

32:19.033 --> 32:24.400
And we... are satisfied.
>> KIM: This is delish.

32:24.400 --> 32:30.600
>> KRIS: Come give me a hug.
Come give me a hug.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.500
>> NORTH: Hi, Snapchat.

32:34.200 --> 32:39.567
>> KIM: Okay, let me call Khloe,
and my mom and Kourtney real

32:39.567 --> 32:42.200
quick.
Who should be the lucky one for

32:42.200 --> 32:44.400
me to tell them first?
>> STEPHANIE: Well, Kourtney

32:44.400 --> 32:46.667
doesn't get very excited about
anything.

32:46.667 --> 32:48.867
>> KIM: Okay, so we'll call
Khloe.

32:48.867 --> 32:52.400
>> STEPHANIE: Khloe, yeah.
(phone rings)

32:52.400 --> 32:54.934
>> KHLOE: Hello?
>> KIM: Hey, what are you doing?

32:54.934 --> 32:57.934
>> KHLOE: Uh, about to have Taco
Tuesday with the whole team

32:57.934 --> 33:00.667
here.
>> KIM: No way. So fun.

33:00.667 --> 33:03.333
So, are you by yourself?
>> KHLOE: I'm by myself.

33:03.333 --> 33:09.734
>> KIM: So, guess what?
>> KHLOE: I'm afraid. What?

33:09.734 --> 33:11.967
You're living out two separate
lives.

33:11.967 --> 33:13.967
You won't say his name, like
we're talking about this

33:13.967 --> 33:16.734
invisible man, that's so crazy.
>> KOURTNEY: So say the (bleep)

33:16.734 --> 33:19.667
name, but shut the (bleep) up!

33:23.100 --> 33:27.533
>> KIM: So, guess what?
>> KHLOE: I'm afraid. What?

33:27.533 --> 33:30.333
>> KIM: What happens every time
I say "Guess what?"

33:30.333 --> 33:33.533
>> KHLOE: The person's pregnant.
>> KIM: We're having a baby.

33:33.533 --> 33:36.433
(Khloe squeals)
>> KHLOE: What kind?

33:36.433 --> 33:38.600
>> KIM: A girl.
>> KHLOE: Shut up. So you know

33:38.600 --> 33:41.100
what it is already?
>> KIM: Yeah.

33:41.100 --> 33:43.633
>> KHLOE: Oh, my goodness.
I mean, it's so exciting either

33:43.633 --> 33:45.633
way.
I can't believe you're gonna

33:45.633 --> 33:48.900
have three kids.
>> KIM: Telling my family about

33:48.900 --> 33:51.400
this news, I mean, it is that
exciting feeling like you're

33:51.400 --> 33:54.233
pregnant.
It's the exact same feeling,

33:54.233 --> 33:56.900
especially right at the
beginning.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.033
>> KRIS: Aw.
>> KIM: Don't cry. Don't cry.

33:59.033 --> 34:01.333
>> KRIS: Oh, Kim, I'm so happy
for you.

34:01.333 --> 34:04.600
I know, I just... To be able to
do that is really great.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.700
I'm really happy for you.
>> KIM: It's so crazy, right?

34:07.700 --> 34:10.200
You know, it's really exciting,
but it's also like, "Oh, my God,

34:10.200 --> 34:12.633
this is happening."
>> KOURTNEY: No way.

34:12.633 --> 34:15.433
How exciting.
We're gonna have a baby number

34:15.433 --> 34:17.433
seven.
>> KIM: I know, isn't that

34:17.433 --> 34:19.400
crazy?
Mom's gonna have, like, 30

34:19.400 --> 34:22.000
grandkids.
>> KOURTNEY: Are you excited?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.700
>> KIM: I'm so excited.
I mean, you know what?

34:24.700 --> 34:27.233
It's kind of weird when it's not
you.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.233
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, like, it's
just weird.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.266
>> KIM: So I'm like, I don't
know whether to just start

34:31.266 --> 34:36.033
eating donuts and celebrate like
I would, like old times, or just

34:36.033 --> 34:38.967
go to the gym.
>> KOURTNEY: I think you can do

34:38.967 --> 34:40.967
both.
>> KIM: Kanye and I, we're

34:40.967 --> 34:43.266
like, "What do we do? We do
nothing for nine months."

34:43.266 --> 34:45.266
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KIM: I'm totally gonna

34:45.266 --> 34:47.300
forget, seriously.
And then like a month before,

34:47.300 --> 34:49.433
we're gonna be like, "Holy
(bleep)! We need to get a

34:49.433 --> 34:52.767
nursery!"
Just kidding.

34:52.767 --> 34:56.333
(laughs)
Do we look like deers?

34:56.333 --> 34:58.533
Ooh.
>> KOURTNEY: You're so cute,

34:58.533 --> 35:00.633
Reigny.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.567
>> KHLOE: Hello.
>> LARSA: Hey, guys.

35:03.567 --> 35:05.433
>> KOURTNEY: Should we sit and
eat?

35:05.433 --> 35:07.233
>> LARSA: Are we sharing salads?
>> KOURTNEY: Yours is in the

35:07.233 --> 35:09.867
fridge.
>> KHLOE: Why are you smiling

35:09.867 --> 35:14.033
like that?
Hello, obviously you're talking

35:14.033 --> 35:18.934
to some-- Oh, come on.
>> KOURTNEY: What?

35:18.934 --> 35:21.900
>> KHLOE: Kourt, you're grinning
from ear to ear.

35:21.900 --> 35:26.533
>> KOURTNEY: Khloe, you don't
get to know all my secrets.

35:26.533 --> 35:29.433
>> KHLOE: Well, Kourt's actually
getting on my (bleep) nerve.

35:29.433 --> 35:32.667
Just like, the stupid smile,
like, smack the stupid smile off

35:32.667 --> 35:35.800
your (bleep) face.
I'm fed up with this whole,

35:35.800 --> 35:37.967
like, silence game.

35:39.900 --> 35:42.900
What were you just doing?
>> KOURTNEY: I'm going on a

35:42.900 --> 35:45.400
trip.
He's planning everything.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.467
>> KHLOE: Okay.
>> KOURTNEY: It's a surprise, so

35:47.467 --> 35:50.333
you're not gonna get to know the
location, but I have been told

35:50.333 --> 35:52.500
what to pack.
>> KHLOE: Well, that will be

35:52.500 --> 35:56.900
fun.
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

35:56.900 --> 35:59.000
>> KHLOE: Yup.
>> KOURTNEY: Why are you giving

35:59.000 --> 36:02.300
me a look?
>> KHLOE: How secretive she is?

36:02.300 --> 36:05.700
It's just so frustrating.
Like, we share everything else.

36:05.700 --> 36:08.266
>> LARSA: Are you comfortable,
like, talking about him, or no?

36:08.266 --> 36:10.633
>> KOURTNEY: Not real-- like, I
don't feel like sitting and,

36:10.633 --> 36:13.867
like, airing my business.
>> KHLOE: I am the queen of

36:13.867 --> 36:17.633
secrecy as well, but you won't
even say his name.

36:17.633 --> 36:20.000
Like, that's crazy.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, but I'm not

36:20.000 --> 36:22.367
using it on the show. I'm not.
>> KHLOE: His name?

36:22.367 --> 36:24.266
It's all in the press.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, it doesn't

36:24.266 --> 36:26.900
matter.
I don't feel like I need to,

36:26.900 --> 36:31.133
like... expose.
>> KHLOE: If no one ever knew

36:31.133 --> 36:33.934
about something, that's fine.
But then you're sitting here,

36:33.934 --> 36:36.266
going on these trips, doing
things, it's like, people could

36:36.266 --> 36:38.934
piece things together.
No one's saying to film your

36:38.934 --> 36:41.200
trip, I'm saying, (bleep),
just say the name.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.300
Like, what are we talking about,
this invisible man?

36:43.300 --> 36:45.800
That has, like, some code word?
That's so crazy.

36:45.800 --> 36:49.166
Like, how old are you? Three?
It's so weird that everyone's

36:49.166 --> 36:52.066
tiptoeing around it.
Like, okay, the guy Kourtney's

36:52.066 --> 36:54.367
dating.
Cool.

36:54.367 --> 36:56.400
Younes, Y, whatever the (bleep)
you want to call him.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.467
>> KOURTNEY: I don't need to
expose every aspect of my life.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.233
>> KHLOE: No one is saying you
need to do that.

37:00.233 --> 37:02.200
I'm not saying to expose your
relationship.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.000
>> KOURTNEY: And I don't need
to.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.767
>> KHLOE: I don't get it.
Stop talking about these trips

37:05.767 --> 37:07.700
then, if you don't want to say
who you're going on the trip

37:07.700 --> 37:10.133
with, then stop being seen with
peop-- It's like...

37:10.133 --> 37:12.400
You're living now two separate
lives.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.266
And you're not (bleep) saying
the name.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.400
That's so (bleep) stupid.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, so say the

37:16.400 --> 37:21.300
(bleep) name, but shut the
(bleep) up!

37:21.300 --> 37:23.133
>> KHLOE: For you.
Like, do you have peace of mind

37:23.133 --> 37:25.066
ever?
Just, like, it's a lot.

37:25.066 --> 37:29.333
>> KIM: Yeah, it is frustrating
to not be able to do it on your

37:29.333 --> 37:31.333
own.
When you're not carrying it

37:31.333 --> 37:39.066
yourself, like, you are
disconnected.

37:39.066 --> 37:40.900
>> KHLOE: You're not (bleep)
saying the name.

37:40.900 --> 37:43.200
That's so (bleep) stupid.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, so say the

37:43.200 --> 37:47.367
(bleep) name, but shut the
(bleep) up!

37:47.367 --> 37:49.200
>> LARSA: I feel like she's
doing what you did in the

37:49.200 --> 37:51.000
beginning.
Like, you don't know where your

37:51.000 --> 37:52.500
relationship is, so, you don't
so, you don't want to...

37:52.500 --> 37:54.233
>> KHLOE: Totally, and I get
that.

37:54.233 --> 37:55.934
I'm not saying that, but don't
(bleep) it's the name.

37:55.934 --> 37:57.767
>> LARSA: She's just talking
about the name.

37:57.767 --> 37:59.433
>> KHLOE: I'm not telling her to
tell me his dick size and what

37:59.433 --> 38:01.200
the (bleep) she's doing in the
bedroom.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.867
>> LARSA: I feel like everybody
at this point knows the dude's

38:02.867 --> 38:04.633
name.
>> KHLOE: Everyone does, but

38:04.633 --> 38:06.433
that's what's so (bleep) weird
to me.

38:06.433 --> 38:08.367
Like, get over yourself.
It's so strange.

38:08.367 --> 38:11.734
>> KOURTNEY: I mean, I don't
know, like, what the balance

38:11.734 --> 38:16.033
should be with, like, showing
and not showing, but, like, you

38:16.033 --> 38:20.333
can't, like, yell at me for,
like, how I want to handle it

38:20.333 --> 38:22.233
and don't.

38:24.367 --> 38:29.667
Before we started the show is
when, like, Scott and I first

38:29.667 --> 38:32.233
started being together.
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.

38:32.233 --> 38:35.533
>> KOURTNEY: I haven't, like,
been dating somebody since.

38:35.533 --> 38:37.400
>> KHLOE: Right.
>> KOURTNEY: I haven't had a

38:37.400 --> 38:39.400
boyfriend since that, you know?
So, I'm not gonna, like...

38:39.400 --> 38:41.400
>> KHLOE: Do you have a
boyfriend now?

38:41.400 --> 38:44.133
>> KOURTNEY: Sure, Khloe.
But I'm not gonna...

38:44.133 --> 38:46.133
>> KHLOE: You do?
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

38:46.133 --> 38:47.967
>> KHLOE: So you guys have had,
like, the talk?

38:47.967 --> 38:49.734
Like, are you guys really
official?

38:49.734 --> 38:51.500
Like, you guys, like, I know
that...

38:51.500 --> 38:53.367
>> KOURTNEY: Yes.
>> LARSA: She's definitely in a

38:53.367 --> 38:55.333
relationship.
>> KHLOE: I cannot believe Kourt

38:55.333 --> 38:57.400
actually says that she has a
boyfriend.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.500
Boyfriend!
Kourtney has a boyfriend!

39:00.500 --> 39:03.700
I'm just happy she's (bleep)
talking about it.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.700
That's news to me, Kim and
Steph.

39:05.700 --> 39:08.266
You've never said this.
And look at you laughing.

39:08.266 --> 39:10.533
Like, you definitely are so
awkward at times.

39:10.533 --> 39:12.533
I mean...
(Larsa laughs)

39:12.533 --> 39:14.367
>> LARSA: No, she's like a
teenager right now.

39:14.367 --> 39:16.633
>> KHLOE: Yeah.
>> LARSA: It's a teenage phase.

39:16.633 --> 39:21.300
(Kourtney laughs quietly)
(Larsa laughs)

39:21.300 --> 39:24.200
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God.

39:31.700 --> 39:35.233
Daily Mail
posted, "Kim Kardashian

39:35.233 --> 39:37.233
reminisces as she visits old
house she shared with Kris

39:37.233 --> 39:40.133
Humphries."
He literally spent one night.

39:40.133 --> 39:42.667
Can I retweet it and be like,
"Boo, didn't even have a

39:42.667 --> 39:44.400
toothbrush there, honey.
Stop reaching."?

39:44.400 --> 39:46.400
(Khloe laughs)
>> KOURTNEY: And I'll call you

39:46.400 --> 39:50.533
back.
>> KHLOE: So, how is everything

39:50.533 --> 39:53.700
going with your surrogate?
Like, I feel like I don't even

39:53.700 --> 39:56.433
know what's happening.
>> KIM: I mean, it definitely

39:56.433 --> 39:59.767
is, like, a different process.
Like, it is...

39:59.767 --> 40:01.800
>> KOURTNEY: Like, I don't even
feel like this is real.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.433
>> KIM: Same. The fact that this
is just what we can do these

40:04.433 --> 40:07.233
days, I'm, like, really
thankful.

40:07.233 --> 40:11.600
Like, I'm seriously so grateful
for her, and that someone is

40:11.600 --> 40:15.500
just so, like, selfless and kind
to do this.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.400
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KIM: And I definitely want to

40:17.400 --> 40:19.834
keep it private.
Like, I don't want people to

40:19.834 --> 40:22.433
find my surrogate.
Like, I don't want them to

40:22.433 --> 40:24.600
harass her.
Like, she doesn't know how to

40:24.600 --> 40:27.300
handle stuff like that.
This isn't her world.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.600
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KIM: I don't want people

40:29.600 --> 40:32.233
following her and chasing her.
It can be dangerous.

40:32.233 --> 40:34.567
I know how dangerous it was.
I almost got into the craziest

40:34.567 --> 40:37.266
car accident when I was
pregnant, 'cause the paparazzi

40:37.266 --> 40:39.633
was chasing me.
So it's just, like, a safety

40:39.633 --> 40:42.667
thing.
>> KHLOE: That's a lot on, like,

40:42.667 --> 40:45.934
just her.
Like, it's a lot to take on that

40:45.934 --> 40:47.934
role and...
Just even for you.

40:47.934 --> 40:50.000
Like, do you have peace of mind
ever?

40:50.000 --> 40:52.700
Just, like, it's a lot.
>> KIM: Yeah. It is frustrating,

40:52.700 --> 40:59.800
like... like, to not be able to
do it on your own.

40:59.800 --> 41:03.767
It is a weird dynamic.
Like, I go to all the doctor's

41:03.767 --> 41:06.100
appointments, and I try to be
really present.

41:06.100 --> 41:09.200
But when you're not carrying it
yourself, like, it is such a

41:09.200 --> 41:13.233
fine balance of how much you're
gonna be in their lives.

41:13.233 --> 41:16.133
Of course I want to know every
last detail that's going on with

41:16.133 --> 41:18.934
my baby, and that's super
frustrating.

41:18.934 --> 41:22.333
But I really trust my surrogate,
and I don't want to be that

41:22.333 --> 41:25.200
person that's trying to control
her every move.

41:25.200 --> 41:28.500
It's gonna be a long, hard
process, but I'm gonna take it

41:28.500 --> 41:35.967
one day at a time, and,
hopefully, it just gets easier.

41:35.967 --> 41:38.433
>> KHLOE: So, how serious are
you and... Y?

41:38.433 --> 41:40.467
>> KOURTNEY: What kind of
question is that even?

41:40.467 --> 41:42.600
Is there a level?
>> KHLOE: Do you say "I love

41:42.600 --> 41:44.667
you"?

41:52.066 --> 41:55.567
>> KHLOE: I drank one gallon of
water just in my workout

41:55.567 --> 41:58.333
yesterday.
I peed at least 700 times.

41:58.333 --> 42:00.333
>> KIM: I had three bottles of
water today.

42:00.333 --> 42:02.333
>> KOURTNEY: How much is a
gallon?

42:02.333 --> 42:07.433
>> KHLOE: A gallon is a gallon.
Um, Kourt and I kind of got into

42:07.433 --> 42:09.266
a fight the other day.
Like, we were at the kitchen

42:09.266 --> 42:11.066
table...
>> KIM: You guys never get into

42:11.066 --> 42:12.834
fights.
>> KHLOE: I know. We definitely

42:12.834 --> 42:14.700
got into, like, an argument.
>> KOURTNEY: We did.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.633
>> KHLOE: We did, and Larsa was
there, and Larsa was, like,

42:16.633 --> 42:19.500
sitting, like...
I was just like, "What the

42:19.500 --> 42:22.533
(bleep) is up your ass?
Like, you won't even say your

42:22.533 --> 42:25.333
boyfriend's name."
That lunch with Larsa was the

42:25.333 --> 42:28.300
first time you ever said you had
a boyfriend.

42:28.300 --> 42:30.200
>> KIM: Yeah.
>> KHLOE: You just downplay it a

42:30.200 --> 42:32.200
lot.
Like, you like to...

42:32.200 --> 42:34.133
I think that's, like, your
deflecting or, like,

42:34.133 --> 42:36.133
downplaying.
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

42:36.133 --> 42:37.867
>> KHLOE: And then somehow just
gets into this ten-year

42:37.867 --> 42:39.734
relationship.
>> KOURTNEY: There are some

42:39.734 --> 42:43.100
people that just really casually
just, like, have new people in

42:43.100 --> 42:46.100
their lives all the time.
Like, that's just not me.

42:46.100 --> 42:51.033
>> KHLOE: Yeah. So how serious
are you and... Y?

42:51.033 --> 42:53.233
>> KOURTNEY: Wouldn't you like
to know?

42:53.233 --> 42:56.367
>> KHLOE: Y.
How serious?

42:56.367 --> 42:58.667
>> KOURTNEY: What kind of
question is that even?

42:58.667 --> 43:00.500
Is there a level?
>> KHLOE: Do you say "I love

43:00.500 --> 43:03.533
you."?
>> KOURTNEY: Khloe...

43:03.533 --> 43:05.533
>> KIM: Does he work out with
you and Joe?

43:05.533 --> 43:07.967
>> KOURTNEY: He is going to.
(Khloe gasps, Kourtney laughs)

43:07.967 --> 43:11.166
>> KHLOE: Ooh!
That's when you know it's real.

43:11.166 --> 43:13.734
(Kourtney laughs)
(Khloe laughs)

43:13.734 --> 43:16.867
>> KHLOE: On the next episode...
We need to do a fitness tutorial

43:16.867 --> 43:19.633
video.
That's hopscotch.

43:19.633 --> 43:22.900
You don't really follow through.
I just want you to take it

43:22.900 --> 43:26.700
seriously.
>> KIM: You guys, so I went to

43:26.700 --> 43:29.100
this media training.
>> KRIS: I don't want to do

43:29.100 --> 43:31.400
media.
>> WOMAN: Kris, were there signs

43:31.400 --> 43:34.600
that Bruce, at the time, wanted
to become a woman?

43:34.600 --> 43:37.200
>> KENDALL: It's just (bleep)
one thing after another.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.033
I'm literally going home.
