01:25.583 --> 01:29.583
The code of the savage.
The Council of the Elders are meeting

01:29.625 --> 01:33.958
to decide which of the younger warriors
shall be sent out after the lions.

01:38.125 --> 01:40.666
Most of the younger warriors
wear headdresses

01:40.708 --> 01:44.291
made from the manes
of the lion they have killed.

01:44.333 --> 01:48.041
Their faces, legs, and chests are
painted red, yellow, and white

01:48.083 --> 01:51.875
with a substance made from the
ashes of previously killed lions.

01:59.791 --> 02:02.666
For now,
the main master of the wild,

02:02.708 --> 02:07.041
the terror that stalks by night,
this grim lord of slaughter

02:07.083 --> 02:11.916
is to meet his doom at the hands of
the only foe who dare molest him,

02:11.958 --> 02:18.458
or the man who steps back in the face
of a charge is forever branded a coward.

02:18.500 --> 02:22.500
The crowded moment begin. The leader
plunges his spear into the beast.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.125
He's down.
His shield protects him.

02:26.166 --> 02:29.666
He's up again.
Not a man will step back.

02:29.708 --> 02:31.458
Look out. There's another one.

02:35.416 --> 02:38.916
Look out!
He's got an-other one.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.500
Quick as lightning,
the white spears clash again.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.708
Even if he falls to his death,
he fights with the spears.

02:57.708 --> 03:02.291
Strange to say, the victors
appear unhappy over their victory,

03:02.333 --> 03:05.208
for the lion is a symbol
to them of everything great,

03:06.250 --> 03:08.916
and they worship
his power with deep respect.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.416
Shit.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.250
Piece of shit. I mean...

04:02.291 --> 04:03.958
Piece of shit.

04:09.583 --> 04:13.250
Do you think the world's
going to change because it's getting warmer?

04:13.291 --> 04:16.291
It'll get cooler.
It'll get warmer. It's called weather.

04:16.333 --> 04:20.250
Yeah, I think it's a big scam for a lot of
people to make a lot of money. In the meantime,

04:20.291 --> 04:24.416
China is eating our lunch. I love the
idea of solar, and then I do a test,

04:24.458 --> 04:27.583
and you get your money back
in 36 years. The problem is

04:27.625 --> 04:31.791
you got to make it economically viable, Bill.
Right now, it's not economically viable.

04:31.833 --> 04:34.708
And if it were, then somebody
would be marketing it. That's for sure.

04:39.625 --> 04:41.041
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Good. How are you?

04:41.083 --> 04:42.291
- I'm doing great.
- Good.

04:44.666 --> 04:47.625
How did we become the richest,
most powerful country in only 200 years?

04:49.166 --> 04:53.208
I guess you can always argue that there's
more than one way to skin a cat, but...

04:54.708 --> 04:58.166
I'll just go ahead
and stick with capitalism

04:58.208 --> 05:01.375
and my second amendment rights.

05:10.208 --> 05:13.333
What's Richard's
flight schedule tomorrow

05:14.541 --> 05:19.583
But it's just like, I mean, I just can't
even tell you how fucking mad I am, you know.

05:19.625 --> 05:23.875
It's like, "Come on, people." I mean this
is why you don't do this stuff, you know.

05:23.916 --> 05:27.416
This is-- I'm sitting here.
Anyway, so... I mean.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.833
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:33.875 --> 05:34.875
Got everything organized?

05:34.916 --> 05:36.041
Yeah. What are you doing?

05:36.083 --> 05:37.791
You getting your nails done?

05:37.833 --> 05:40.750
- Yes.
- Oh, good heavens.

05:40.791 --> 05:42.833
Yeah, got to get them
done for the Fourth.

05:42.875 --> 05:47.125
- Please take care of my grizzly bear. Okay?
- He's good.

05:47.166 --> 05:50.208
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I bought him a new toy today.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.000
Okay, I'm worried
about my grizzly bear.

05:53.458 --> 05:54.958
I think you worry
about him more than me.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.291
I worry about
my dog very much. Yes.

05:58.333 --> 06:02.791
- He's the love of my life.
- Really? We're do I fall?

06:02.833 --> 06:06.958
Well I mean, you're right there, baby,
but I'm just saying. Okay? Alright.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.875
Okay, talk to you later.

06:08.916 --> 06:11.000
- Okay, Love you,
- Love you too. Bye, bye.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.166
Bye.

06:20.625 --> 06:25.208
Yeah. Man, oh man.

06:25.250 --> 06:29.208
I am just
over the moon with this.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.708
Look at that big tuft
he's got there on his elbow.

06:34.458 --> 06:38.000
That is what you call

06:38.041 --> 06:41.708
a big-maned Tanzania lion, baby.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.333
Chris, this thing is a stud.

06:46.125 --> 06:49.833
When I saw him come out,
it only took but a second.

06:53.291 --> 06:54.708
Yeah, this here was...

06:56.083 --> 06:57.458
It was a big day for me.

07:00.291 --> 07:03.083
"Uh, You are one sick, twisted
individual that takes great pleasure

07:03.125 --> 07:07.375
in killing beautiful animals like the lion in
the video. I'm going to ask for your picture

07:07.416 --> 07:12.583
to be put across the world wide web in the
hope that someone will stop you, period.

07:12.625 --> 07:16.750
If they don't, then you deserve
to die a very slow, painful death,

07:16.791 --> 07:21.208
a stroke where you're paralyzed would
be justice for what you're doing.

07:21.250 --> 07:25.416
I bet you are a sexual sadist. That is
why you like to kill innocent animals

07:25.458 --> 07:27.958
because it gets
you hard, sick fuck.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.625
Those innocent animals
don't need to die

07:30.666 --> 07:34.708
because of your disgusting sexual
fetish, you freak. Leave them alone."

07:34.750 --> 07:38.208
I mean, where do you--
where do you get

07:38.250 --> 07:42.083
sexual deviation, uh,
from going hunting?

08:16.666 --> 08:17.791
You know when I say that...

08:20.125 --> 08:23.000
And people might think that it sounds tongue in
cheek when I say that it brings me to tears,

08:23.041 --> 08:25.958
but that's really not true.
It does.

08:42.541 --> 08:44.250
You know, the...

08:50.041 --> 08:52.166
It's hard
to put into words, really,

08:53.583 --> 08:55.083
the feelings
that I have for the lion,

08:56.750 --> 09:02.166
and it's a shame that
people won't take the time to

09:03.416 --> 09:07.416
recognize the importance
that all of us can bring

09:07.458 --> 09:09.541
to their protection,
including the hunters.

09:10.458 --> 09:12.208
You know, and oftentimes...

09:13.291 --> 09:15.666
You know I get mad, and
I'm a very type A personality,

09:15.708 --> 09:18.166
and I think
people who know me see that.

09:18.208 --> 09:20.208
I lift weights, and I'm
aggressive, and that sort of thing,

09:20.250 --> 09:25.416
but, you know, to get to know me
and understand my real feelings

09:26.333 --> 09:30.458
for the wildlife there, would give
somebody a different perspective on--

09:30.500 --> 09:34.375
on what I believe and what I stand for.
And not just me, but a lot of us.

09:34.416 --> 09:38.958
And that's why I get so frustrated that
a lot of the people on the flip side

09:39.000 --> 09:44.208
of our coin you know, bash what we do
and think we're there just to harm,

09:44.250 --> 09:48.125
and to rape, and pillage the wildlife,
and the people, and the territory,

09:48.166 --> 09:50.708
and stuff, but, when nothing's
further from the truth.

09:50.750 --> 09:54.416
I mean, you have to come there.
You have to experience it.

09:54.458 --> 09:59.500
Stop telling me what you think you know.
Come there and see it for yourself.

11:52.125 --> 11:54.083
You speak English.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.041
- She's funny.
- Come on. baby.

13:42.958 --> 13:44.791
Too much dead grass.

13:44.833 --> 13:47.166
This dead grass
is not good food for anything.

13:47.208 --> 13:49.666
There's nothing that eats it.

13:49.708 --> 13:51.958
What we do this time of year,
we burn all of it,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.500
and within a week or 10 days,
all the new growth comes,

13:55.541 --> 13:58.375
and it's much better, much more
nutritious for all the animals,

13:58.416 --> 14:01.250
and it's better
for the bush. Yeah.

15:21.666 --> 15:23.000
I'm just going to
find something to shoot.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.166
Yeah, all right.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.083
Find something to kill.

16:36.416 --> 16:40.666
He said better make another plan to
try and find a hippo when You've got time,

16:40.708 --> 16:44.541
and rather just go and whack a zebra.
He said you should see a zebra,

16:44.583 --> 16:47.666
just to make sure we get a bait of
today because if we don't find one,

16:47.708 --> 16:48.708
then we're screwed, you know?

16:53.541 --> 16:58.958
My role here is to make sure
that during hunting activities,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.625
all the rules
and regulation are followed.

17:12.415 --> 17:17.790
The trophy fee is quite
expensive, $3,000, $4,000.

17:17.833 --> 17:22.290
We don't really want to shoot one of those for
bait because it's such an expensive animal.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.415
We'd rather
shoot something more cheap.

17:29.083 --> 17:33.083
We'd rather shoot something like a hippo.
It's much cheaper, much more bait.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.083
Desperation
is getting bad already.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.250
You'll have to start using
cameramen. We've got plenty of them.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.041
- You got to hang
around, hang around.

17:41.083 --> 17:43.000
Just a lot of bad
luck this morning, really.

17:45.583 --> 17:50.416
Most people in the world think that the
wilderness is like Serengeti National Park

17:50.458 --> 17:52.375
where there
are millions of animals,

17:52.416 --> 17:59.000
but in the reality is that
places like Serengeti may be 5%

17:59.041 --> 18:04.541
of what goes on in Africa. The rest
of Africa is different from Serengeti.

18:04.583 --> 18:08.375
The reality is more like what we
are seeing, where people live,

18:08.416 --> 18:11.708
and people-- There's conflict
with people and animals,

18:11.750 --> 18:14.875
and you see the people
cut the trees down,

18:14.916 --> 18:16.416
and they destroy the habitat.

18:19.041 --> 18:22.166
That's more the reality in
Africa than a national park.

18:23.666 --> 18:28.333
A national park is a fairly
artificial environment.

18:28.375 --> 18:31.041
They put a big border around it,
and they protect it.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.791
But the rest
of Africa's not like that.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.791
Populations
of people increase every year.

18:39.833 --> 18:44.250
Every year they extend their villages
further and further into the bush.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.583
There's less area for the animals to live.
There's more poaching.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.458
It's not all good news
for the animals.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.625
Lots of candy.
We give candy to the kids.

19:14.666 --> 19:15.583
There you go.

19:23.875 --> 19:27.541
She saw a lion. Sometimes she's
moving from one village to another village.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.166
She saw a lion,
but all the younger ones,

19:29.208 --> 19:30.916
they haven't yet seen any lions.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.625
It's a delicate line
you walk because as hunters,

19:45.666 --> 19:48.500
we want to maintain
this are as a hunting area.

19:48.541 --> 19:51.583
As people, they want to look at it, and say:
"Oh, there's some forest. There's some land.

19:51.625 --> 19:55.750
I can go and plant some stuff," so there's
always that little bit of tension, you know.

19:55.791 --> 19:58.958
but overall they
see us as a beneficiary here

19:59.000 --> 20:03.833
because we employ some of these guys in
the camps and their families, you know.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.666
They're forever
criticizing colonialism,

20:08.708 --> 20:11.958
and the white man,
and what he did, and...

20:12.000 --> 20:14.166
but then I always say,
Well, okay.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.375
The very man
who's criticizing it

20:16.416 --> 20:18.000
is standing
in a three-piece suit,

20:18.041 --> 20:20.583
wearing a tie,
black shoes, belt.

20:20.625 --> 20:24.750
He woke up in a house of bricks and
tiles with electricity and piped water,

20:24.791 --> 20:28.666
and he picks up his cell phone,
and he cooks his breakfast in a toaster.

20:28.708 --> 20:31.000
Every single
thing he does, from there,

20:31.041 --> 20:35.458
getting in his car, going on a
blacktopped road to the office, you know.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.875
Turning on a computer... Everything
there came from the Western world.

20:40.208 --> 20:43.291
So, he's utilizing
everything that's Western,

20:43.333 --> 20:47.000
and he wants to be in that zone.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.291
That's the conflict.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.250
Yeah, Africa's very confused,
you know.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.083
They have this conflict,
internal conflict.

20:59.583 --> 21:02.958
Hard thing for the Western
world to understand as well.

21:31.291 --> 21:35.541
Very, very ancient technology,
passed down from father to son.

21:35.583 --> 21:38.000
- This is bush technology here.
- Yeah.

21:38.041 --> 21:40.500
You don't have
a tractor with a

21:40.541 --> 21:42.708
When you don't have
a trailer, this is what you do.

22:38.416 --> 22:42.750
I love the sound of the glass.
The sound of the African bush.

22:45.416 --> 22:47.666
- It might be a little strong.
- What do you want?

22:47.708 --> 22:48.750
Some Red Label?

22:50.708 --> 22:51.791
Wash the dust off.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.583
Did some bush bashing today.

22:57.958 --> 22:59.416
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

22:59.458 --> 23:02.500
- Good day.
- see a leopard.

23:02.541 --> 23:04.208
Yeah, it was cool
seeing a leopard today.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.833
O-oh,
well, that was a bad idea.

23:07.875 --> 23:09.333
Been a certain place.

23:09.375 --> 23:11.583
Guys says
you have a big nose.

23:11.625 --> 23:13.916
Puts his fucking
drink down, you know.

23:13.958 --> 23:15.833
- O-oh
- Unless he put's his drink down.

23:15.875 --> 23:18.250
- That's a problem.
- Okay.

23:18.291 --> 23:21.791
Grabbed him by his head, boff,
headbutted him, bwak, down on the ground,

23:21.833 --> 23:23.458
- grabs him by--
- That headbutt will get you.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.791
Grabs him by his hair,
walks him to the door.

23:25.833 --> 23:28.916
It's like on the second floor,
so there's a set of stairs,

23:28.958 --> 23:32.458
fuck, drags him by his hair
to the door. This guy's out.

23:32.500 --> 23:35.500
I mean, his eyes--
eyes are like... You know?

23:35.541 --> 23:38.958
Drags him to the steps, pushes
him over, fucking kicks him.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.458
He rolls down three steps,
comes back, picks up his drink.

23:42.500 --> 23:46.958
He says: "Shit, sorry about
that. Uh, What were we saying?"

23:47.000 --> 23:50.375
There's like blood on the roof,
and there's blood on the walls.

23:50.416 --> 23:55.125
He's talking about the guy that was
convicted for murder and put in jail, P.H.

23:55.166 --> 23:57.291
Went to prison
for like fighting?

23:57.333 --> 23:59.458
- No, he went to prison for murder.
- Oh. Shoot.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.541
- Ten years.
- Yeah, but...

24:01.583 --> 24:03.916
They said he smoked
a fucking poacher.

24:03.958 --> 24:06.958
- Didn't Georgie smoke a poacher?
- Aaron] Yeah, Georgie Ferrera

24:07.000 --> 24:11.166
- smoked a fucking poacher as big as Dallas two years ago.
- Cliffi's, you know.

24:11.208 --> 24:13.875
Cliff House?
Oh, I didn't know that.

24:13.916 --> 24:17.208
This poacher, I mean, dude,
he came up and levelled a gun at Georgie,

24:17.250 --> 24:19.458
just levelled his 500 and,
dou, smoked the guy.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.041
There's no issue with it.
It isn't an issue.

24:22.083 --> 24:26.125
Yeah, I'm not shooting anybody.
When Sammie opened in 2003,

24:26.166 --> 24:29.708
I mean, we were literally
in a shootout back and forth.

24:29.750 --> 24:32.625
I was like: "Holy fucking shit.
Where did I sign up for this bullshit?"

24:32.666 --> 24:36.000
The vultures
were circling their camp.

24:36.041 --> 24:39.916
We went there, and I mean.
And that's when we found...

24:39.958 --> 24:43.500
Man, that was back in the days of,
you know just three-chip color digital,

24:43.541 --> 24:47.916
just standard def, you know, wasn't even...
But I had a camera, and I videoed it all,

24:47.958 --> 24:53.375
and we found 150 dead animals.
What they do is they smoke it.

24:53.416 --> 24:56.666
I mean basically turned it into jerky. They
call it biltong here, but you basically--

24:56.708 --> 25:00.500
For some reason, I pictured fresh,
you know steaks, and their steak's shit.

25:00.541 --> 25:04.083
- I couldn't even sell that.
- They get these monkeys and shit, and they smoke them.

25:04.125 --> 25:07.875
So, yeah. I mean, it still looks like a
monkey, but it's smoked and mummified.

25:07.916 --> 25:09.500
- Yeah.
- And they just--

25:09.541 --> 25:11.666
Yeah, you go
and buy the smoked monkey.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.958
And The truth is, I actually
like the biltong here.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.333
But You know, they dry it, or salt
it, or smoke it, or whatever.

25:21.375 --> 25:23.625
And then, later, they go and put
it in a pot with boiling water,

25:23.666 --> 25:26.291
and they reconstitute it
and then eat it like that.

25:27.875 --> 25:28.958
Yeah, I like it.

26:09.916 --> 26:12.666
I do like those scopes.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.416
He says that he heard buffalo,
yeah, the herd.

26:25.125 --> 26:28.041
Can you see my...
It 's right there.

26:28.083 --> 26:29.791
- That must be why he brought his gun.
- Huh?

26:29.833 --> 26:31.708
That must be
why he brought the gun.

26:35.416 --> 26:36.375
So, they're trying to find...

27:15.875 --> 27:17.250
You see him, bro?

27:49.541 --> 27:51.291
Up to the left.
There's one looking right at us.

27:53.916 --> 27:55.125
See the one looking right at us?

28:01.166 --> 28:02.541
Oh, man.

28:05.625 --> 28:07.875
That's him. What?

28:13.791 --> 28:15.833
Fucking nightmare.

28:50.791 --> 28:52.875
One nice buffalo here.

28:52.916 --> 28:54.458
You just gotta tell me when.

28:54.500 --> 29:01.375
Yeah, this one bullet
in a perfect area.

29:01.416 --> 29:07.875
You know, animals, when you
shoot them, they don't struggle.

29:09.000 --> 29:15.625
They-- They just got--
get a sudden-- sudden death,

29:15.666 --> 29:18.541
which is fine. Yeah.

29:20.083 --> 29:23.250
Well, we've come back to this guy.
We think that other one's

29:23.291 --> 29:25.166
gone over there in the grass.
And so, It's getting late,

29:25.208 --> 29:29.208
so it's probably not too wise
to push it into the grass.

29:29.250 --> 29:30.375
Let me do that again.

29:45.916 --> 29:48.916
It'll be better if you hold the
motherfucker still. Yeah, you've got to find a way

29:48.958 --> 29:51.583
- to brace better, or something.
- That's fatigue.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.958
from been doing it for--
how long? I mean, I was...

30:01.958 --> 30:03.166
Happy days, boys.

30:05.750 --> 30:07.500
The best part
of the buffalo right there.

30:10.875 --> 30:14.416
Yeah, there we go, splat.
Beautiful.

30:15.458 --> 30:18.458
Very tasty.
Two days' time, on the cold,

30:19.333 --> 30:22.458
filled in pepper,
one glass of red wine.

30:23.916 --> 30:25.666
Yeah, that's gonna be good.

31:27.458 --> 31:31.083
A big male could eat
higher than I could reach.

31:31.125 --> 31:34.916
He just stands up on his back
legs and he could eat way up here.

31:34.958 --> 31:37.125
Way up here. I mean,
they're big, they're huge,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.375
Because he could eat all this,
he could eat most of this, no problem.

31:41.250 --> 31:43.375
- It's little bit lower.
- it's a little bit low.

31:43.416 --> 31:45.791
- but we're gonna change it tomorrow.
- Yeah.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.958
Yeah, if he comes and gets a fill of
this, he ain't going nowhere.

31:55.500 --> 31:56.958
That's right.

31:59.041 --> 32:03.500
Look out. Oh, you don't
want that on you. Nuh-uh. Bad stuff.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.500
Is the shit-slinging done yet?

32:14.083 --> 32:16.666
Nuh-uh, look out. Look out.

32:43.666 --> 32:47.500
You kill a couple buffalos,
you get a lion, you get a leopard.

32:47.541 --> 32:50.291
You have them taxidermized.
You're probable looking at what?

32:50.333 --> 32:54.208
- 150, 175 thousand.
- You're certainly looking well over a hundred.

32:54.250 --> 32:56.333
The most expensive
companies in Tanzania

32:56.375 --> 32:57.875
are over a hundred
thousand dollars

32:57.916 --> 33:00.083
before you even
have any kind of success.

33:02.875 --> 33:06.291
If you're gonna kill a lion,
this is the kinda lion you need to kill.

33:06.333 --> 33:09.875
Must be six or greater, must be on its
own, must not be in a pride,

33:09.916 --> 33:13.625
must not have cubs. There's
a whole set of guidelines

33:13.666 --> 33:15.791
and for people
like myself and Aaron,

33:15.833 --> 33:19.708
who-- we have the lions'
interests at heart,

33:19.750 --> 33:24.416
we truly do. You know, You don't just
do that if you don't care about it

33:24.458 --> 33:27.166
and I care about doing it
right and doing it properly

33:27.208 --> 33:30.750
and I mean that's what this is all about.
Statistically, right, no,

33:30.791 --> 33:34.333
you probably won't get one, but
you bought yourself a lion hunt,

33:34.375 --> 33:36.250
and you'll go home
having hunted lions.

33:52.125 --> 33:54.916
A couple of hyenas,
feeding here last night.

33:54.958 --> 33:57.791
Jumping up,
latching on, pulling off.

34:09.291 --> 34:13.083
Sometimes you get a moment
when the light hits the grass

34:13.125 --> 34:15.666
just right or the light goes
through the leaves of a tree

34:15.708 --> 34:19.625
and it looks really nice. So you've
got to take a picture cause this is...

34:19.666 --> 34:23.250
This is film
nature is a character,

34:23.291 --> 34:28.125
so, I mean, you have to be able to capture
those moments when there's beautiful things.

34:31.166 --> 34:33.708
I think that probably
should, that's pretty square.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.500
- This things are all pretty wide, wide angle.
- Yeah.

34:36.541 --> 34:39.375
Yeah, we'll see tomorrow if we don't
get some pics we'll move it again.

34:41.333 --> 34:44.958
It should be fine.
Alright, let's rock and roll.

35:24.291 --> 35:26.208
Fuck. Fucking shit.

35:27.625 --> 35:28.708
Fuck.

35:28.750 --> 35:30.416
I mean that's a perfect shot.

35:32.208 --> 35:34.583
That buffalo shouldn't have gone
200 yards and fell over stone dead.

35:37.333 --> 35:41.000
That's the same piece that would have
robbed the fucking dog shit out of me.

35:41.041 --> 35:43.333
Hand me that gun,
will you? Just--

35:44.833 --> 35:51.083
At least we found it
so we know that it's terminated.

35:53.666 --> 35:57.166
It's not good to find it
too late like this.

36:04.958 --> 36:07.708
Yeah, I mean He's not
really getting that reflector on me.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.708
Yeah, I mean it's okay.

36:11.750 --> 36:15.000
Oh, I know,
but I don't want just okay.

36:15.041 --> 36:16.708
Yeah see the reflector's
not even on me.

36:16.750 --> 36:18.375
See if maybe we
can get Dean to hold it.

36:30.541 --> 36:31.750
Yeah.

36:34.416 --> 36:37.958
maybe just up a little
bit. Up a little bit higher.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.333
No, you-- up higher.

36:47.416 --> 36:49.541
We want it just a little bit
higher, just a little bit higher.

37:59.250 --> 38:00.125
- Morning.
- Morning.

38:01.125 --> 38:02.583
Everybody sleep okay?

38:04.875 --> 38:07.541
Well, I wasn't dreaming
I was covered in ants, yeah.

38:07.583 --> 38:11.083
You're still covered in ants?
That lets you know that you're alive.

38:11.125 --> 38:12.458
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

38:27.083 --> 38:28.500
- Morning, boys.
- How you doing man?

38:28.541 --> 38:31.125
Well, well, well.
Good, good, good.

38:31.166 --> 38:34.291
I was born funny, dude.
Haven't you noticed that?

38:35.958 --> 38:37.416
When you're that
ugly you gotta be something.

38:37.458 --> 38:38.833
That's right.

38:40.750 --> 38:44.708
When you gotta a face for radio,
you gotta come up with some good lines.

38:46.333 --> 38:47.958
Face for radio, dreams for TV.

38:49.958 --> 38:51.250
Live a little in the mean-time.

38:52.875 --> 38:55.000
- Or a lot.
- Live a lot in the mean-time.

39:00.125 --> 39:02.250
Well, let's see what kind
of trouble we can get into today.

39:08.833 --> 39:10.666
Yeah, I'd like
to see a big lion on bait.

39:14.125 --> 39:18.541
- That'd be alright.
- The baits are in good places, it's a waiting game.

39:20.083 --> 39:25.625
If they were easy to kill, then we'd sell
them on five day hunts six days hunt.

39:25.666 --> 39:27.583
It's 21 day hunt for a reason.

39:33.958 --> 39:37.458
- It's a leopard.
- Claw marks on the tree.

39:39.041 --> 39:40.625
Yeah, you can see the leopard.

39:42.333 --> 39:44.625
That's a big female or
a young male, it's not very big.

39:52.083 --> 39:53.500
It's the way it goes.

39:55.708 --> 39:59.375
They can drive you crazy these
why didn't you do it? He gets so frustrated,

39:59.416 --> 40:02.041
you know, checking. Why didn't he come?
Why did-- He says boss:

40:02.083 --> 40:04.583
"He's got four legs,
we've got two."

40:05.750 --> 40:07.833
It's a simple explanation.

40:07.875 --> 40:09.958
He'll do what he wants
to do, he's an animal.

40:17.375 --> 40:19.250
That water looks really tasty.
- M-hm.

40:26.541 --> 40:28.500
How big does
a big male leopard get?

40:28.541 --> 40:31.125
Around here,
probably 150, 160 pounds.

40:31.166 --> 40:33.625
But a big male lion's 3, 4?

40:33.666 --> 40:36.916
Oh no, he's probably
a big male lion, 450 pounds.

40:38.958 --> 40:41.250
- It's a big cat.
- It's a big cat.

44:04.250 --> 44:07.791
The worst thing that can ever
happen is vultures find your bait.

44:07.833 --> 44:10.166
It's very frustrating.

44:17.500 --> 44:22.583
In America, that's what I do there.
I've been a hunting guide for 24 years.

44:22.625 --> 44:24.708
So, I've guided lots of--
lots of hunters, so...

44:24.750 --> 44:28.000
- Does it pay there, over there?
- Does it what?

44:28.041 --> 44:29.333
- Pay.
- Yeah.

44:31.958 --> 44:35.125
- More than here?
- Uh.

44:35.166 --> 44:38.333
You know, It all depends,
I mean, some places yeah,

44:38.375 --> 44:40.625
some places, no.
Yeah, it just all depends.

44:42.583 --> 44:48.541
So, where I live we have elk and
deer and big horned sheep and goats

44:48.583 --> 44:51.291
and mountain lions,
you know, and all that stuff.

44:51.333 --> 44:57.541
But I live up in the mountains.
It's very pretty, but it's cold.

45:00.875 --> 45:04.625
But it's very pretty. You know,
in our country where you have, you know,

45:04.666 --> 45:09.333
only a 10% unemployment rate, You
know, so 90% of the people have jobs,

45:09.375 --> 45:11.541
you know, they don't
need to go live off the land,

45:11.583 --> 45:14.166
and live off the wildlife,
you know?

45:14.208 --> 45:18.750
So, we can still continue to protect
our wild places and wildlife resources.

45:19.708 --> 45:23.541
Here, I understand it's a different
story, man. I do. Look I've seen it,

45:23.583 --> 45:27.458
I know, I understand, but gosh
damn, I hate to see the wildlife

45:27.500 --> 45:30.166
and the wild lands,
you know be the loser.

45:30.208 --> 45:32.791
But, eventually
they're gonna be the loser.

45:32.833 --> 45:34.875
Because the people
are gonna win.

46:04.958 --> 46:06.958
He doesn't
have a great big mane.

46:08.041 --> 46:10.416
But I mean he has big shoulders,
big, I mean--

46:10.458 --> 46:14.083
he's not streamlined.
He has big shoulders and big back.

46:28.083 --> 46:32.333
I promise you, I could have shot that
lion, that's not what it is about.

46:32.375 --> 46:34.791
We're going to try to get them on
bait, try to get a better assessment,

46:34.833 --> 46:37.833
try to get a better closer look at him.
I mean, you want to try to get

46:37.875 --> 46:40.291
a good assessment
before you just start shooting.

46:40.333 --> 46:42.833
I mean, I think that was a
prime example of people thinking

46:42.875 --> 46:46.083
we just wire a wire through the bush
and if a lion jumps out, we smoke him.

46:46.125 --> 46:47.250
Well, that's not
the way it works.

46:55.416 --> 46:57.208
Hey watch, be careful,
he's known.

47:10.125 --> 47:12.250
A little different than
a buffalo, that's for sure.

47:13.708 --> 47:14.875
What we came for.

48:14.416 --> 48:17.208
I was still walking in
the dark in the early morning,

48:17.250 --> 48:21.708
and the two male lions started fighting to
my left, close, close, close in the dark.

48:21.750 --> 48:25.083
I don't know why they started fighting,
but all of a sudden they started fighting.

48:26.958 --> 48:29.500
And then-- I mean,
the sound was un believable,

48:29.541 --> 48:31.875
You know, you need to record that
early in the morning when it's quiet.

48:33.208 --> 48:35.833
But, same, in the dark
right here, fighting.

48:40.291 --> 48:41.625
They were mad.

48:44.041 --> 48:48.416
Could you have the chef in the
future not put the tuna fish on the bread?

48:48.458 --> 48:51.041
You want it separate?
Do you want some other?

48:51.083 --> 48:55.166
No. I mean, I don't
really like tuna fish, so...

48:57.625 --> 49:00.791
Goddamn it,
get the fuck off of me.

49:02.416 --> 49:04.291
But he can bring you
some normal bread if you want.

49:07.916 --> 49:09.208
No, it's fine, it's fine.

49:12.666 --> 49:17.208
I've had seven wounded
lions that I've had to follow.

49:17.250 --> 49:20.333
When you know they're aliv e and you've still
got to go and find them, I've had seven,

49:20.375 --> 49:24.833
and only two of them charged.
Some lions don't always charge, you know.

49:24.875 --> 49:27.958
They call them cowardly lions,
but I don't like that word.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.958
It's not a cowardly lion,
it's just--

49:30.000 --> 49:33.833
But, yeah, not all of them have
it in them to charge, but still,

49:33.875 --> 49:38.041
when you get the one that does,
it's incredibly intimidating.

49:38.083 --> 49:41.541
If you consider the combination of
speed and aggression and strength--

49:41.583 --> 49:42.583
Mm-hmm.

49:44.166 --> 49:47.291
That combination and the fact
that they can hide in the bush

49:47.333 --> 49:52.791
and you don't see them until-- you
know, it's my least favorite for sure.

49:56.333 --> 49:57.750
Yeah.

50:59.958 --> 51:04.000
Waiting for
the hippo to show himself.

51:06.541 --> 51:09.458
It's not a lot of fun.
It's boring.

51:20.916 --> 51:23.041
You realize by the time this
thing comes out of the water

51:23.083 --> 51:24.625
it's probably
going to be close to dark.

51:28.125 --> 51:30.041
- It's 6:30.
- Well I don't care what time it is,

51:30.083 --> 51:31.583
I'm just talking
about light-wise.

52:06.208 --> 52:10.500
When they don't move like that,
he's lying dead on the bottom in the sand.

52:10.541 --> 52:12.541
Yeah, we'll come
in the morning and find him.

52:39.791 --> 52:42.833
Have you heard of that
group Tanzanians for Wildlife?

52:42.875 --> 52:49.791
They were petitioning Tanzanian Wildlife Department
to not issue me a visa to enter the country.

52:51.375 --> 52:53.375
There's some
pieces of shit around the place.

52:53.416 --> 52:55.583
But the thing I saw on
TV, there are these elephants

52:55.625 --> 52:58.416
walking in a field, and there's a
female elephant, and then they're

52:58.458 --> 53:00.916
all grouped together, and they start
trying to run, and they're grouping

53:00.958 --> 53:02.750
and the next minute
you see a gun barrel,

53:03.875 --> 53:06.291
and you see a bullet
come out of the gun barrel.

53:08.416 --> 53:12.625
And as it hits one of the elephants,
the picture sort of dissolves

53:12.666 --> 53:16.125
and turns into
a woman with two or three kids.

53:16.166 --> 53:18.458
- Oh, fuck.
- Right. and she's now running

53:18.500 --> 53:21.791
in the field and they're all scared
and she's holding the kids, you know?

53:21.833 --> 53:27.958
And off they go. And it's basically,
you know, so flipping well done,

53:28.000 --> 53:32.833
and it's Hollywood-ed that someone sitting
in a chair is gonna: "Oh, my god, shame,

53:32.875 --> 53:35.833
- is that what it's like?".
- Yeah, they just shot a family.

53:35.875 --> 53:38.916
They just a family,
they just a shot her daughter.

53:38.958 --> 53:40.500
- And that's what they do.
- M-hm.

53:40.541 --> 53:43.041
They sway the mindset of people,

53:43.083 --> 53:44.708
that middle chunk of population

53:44.750 --> 53:46.291
who don't know any better.

53:46.333 --> 53:48.666
And we as hunters--
I'm telling you now,

53:48.708 --> 53:53.250
if we don't start doing
the same Hollywood-ed up...

53:54.416 --> 53:57.708
Everybody thinks banning hunting
is going to save wildlife,

53:57.750 --> 54:00.541
- Yeah.
- And the reverse is 100% the case.

54:03.625 --> 54:05.791
You've been here for a week now,

54:05.833 --> 54:07.750
you've seen
anybody else out here?

54:07.791 --> 54:10.208
Ain't anybody else out here.

54:10.250 --> 54:13.041
You think someone is going to come here
and pay you for a photographic safari?

54:14.500 --> 54:18.458
You think when
Sammy Glitchbottom and his wife

54:18.500 --> 54:22.500
and his 2.5 kids rock up
from Indianapolis, Indiana,

54:22.541 --> 54:26.625
with their safari hat on...
he's got a safari hat.

54:26.666 --> 54:32.250
How quickly do you think that the wife
is giving the husband one of these

54:32.291 --> 54:37.500
and saying: "You get us the hell
out of here, and I mean now".

54:38.458 --> 54:41.083
About the third time
the nine year old is screaming

54:41.125 --> 54:44.375
"mommy,
the flies are killing me".

54:46.250 --> 54:47.375
Boom!

54:48.791 --> 54:50.250
Definitely it's true.

54:50.291 --> 54:54.083
There is only
one source of revenue

54:54.125 --> 54:56.333
in the entire
country of Tanzania,

54:56.375 --> 54:58.375
for the Tanzanian
Wildlife Department.

54:58.416 --> 55:00.666
And that is hunting dollars.
Period, end of story.

55:03.708 --> 55:09.333
Yourself for example. Coming on this safari,
you're supporting me, you're supporting Dean,

55:09.375 --> 55:14.375
you're supporting
all the trackers, 20-30 staff,

55:14.416 --> 55:17.083
that come in here
and set up the camps every year.

55:17.125 --> 55:23.958
The admin in town, all their families, the
game scouts that-- and the anti-poaching guys.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.291
The pyramid is like this,
by one guy coming on this safari.

55:29.333 --> 55:32.875
Cause it gives value to wildlife,
it gives you a reason to look after them.

55:32.916 --> 55:35.375
You know, if they don't have
a reason to look after wildlife,

55:35.416 --> 55:37.875
why look after them? You don't.

55:37.916 --> 55:40.541
We look at it, wildlife
from a different perspective

55:40.583 --> 55:43.083
from what black
people look at it as.

55:43.125 --> 55:46.666
Why it sits there for our
entertainment and enjoyment.

55:46.708 --> 55:49.583
But, there's got to be a bigger
reason to look after it,

55:49.625 --> 55:51.625
and they've got
a benefit like Aaron says.

55:51.666 --> 55:53.833
They have to benefit from it,

55:53.875 --> 55:55.666
it's not just
for our luxury purposes.

55:56.583 --> 56:01.416
These people that live out here,
they're not saving money for retirement,

56:01.458 --> 56:05.750
they're not worried about their golf,
you know, their golf house in Florida.

56:05.791 --> 56:10.291
They are simply worried about,
"how do I feed my family today".

56:10.333 --> 56:13.000
These guys don't think past
tomorrow. That don't mean that

56:13.041 --> 56:15.333
because they're not capable
of thinking past tomorrow,

56:15.375 --> 56:19.250
it's because they live in the moment
because today they've got to eat today.

56:20.583 --> 56:21.500
It's how it is.

56:23.500 --> 56:27.666
Yeah, that's reality.
It's not negative, it's reality.

56:29.041 --> 56:30.833
It's unfortunate,
but it's the case.

57:13.708 --> 57:15.500
His blood
is shattered everywhere.

57:19.833 --> 57:22.625
As soon as it hits this rock, it's
going to be as far as it's going to go.

57:29.458 --> 57:32.791
- You never surfed a day in your life.
- Nope. I have now.

57:32.833 --> 57:33.958
Surfed on a hippo.

57:36.041 --> 57:38.416
That's a hell of a way
to start the morning.

57:38.458 --> 57:40.166
See if it's anything
for Tanzania star.

57:42.250 --> 57:44.625
- I probably won't put the surfing picture on Facebook.
- No?

57:46.458 --> 57:47.708
That's a damn shame.

58:37.916 --> 58:41.541
They wanted push-ups, squats,
flutter kicks, and burpees.

58:44.083 --> 58:46.000
- It's hard.
- Oh, that would kick your ass.

58:47.791 --> 58:50.000
Gotta get down. Gotta
get down. Get your chest on the ground.

58:55.375 --> 58:58.458
- How is it on your hands?
- It's not bad.

58:59.375 --> 59:00.791
My feet hurt a little more.

59:00.833 --> 59:02.000
Oh, yeah?

59:45.416 --> 59:47.333
But you'll see,
I mean, when I'm at the lion,

59:47.375 --> 59:51.041
I mean I'll give him, you know,
a moment of silence and...

59:53.583 --> 59:56.250
That's killing. No doubt about it.
You're going to kill him.

59:57.333 --> 01:00:00.291
But you know,
part of it is unexplainable.

01:00:01.708 --> 01:00:04.083
Too much of what you see
in the United States...

01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:10.333
That-- They don't represent, you
know, the way things really are.

01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:13.125
Simba doesn't have a name,
you know. He's not Simba.

01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:17.208
You know, the warthog isn't Pumbaa
and all the other cast of characters

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:20.291
in The Lion King and such, I mean.
They're not buddies. They don't hang out.

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:22.708
They don't dance and run around
and throw parties together.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:26.166
I mean, when Simba sees Pumbaa,
my friend, I assure you,

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:30.333
he's killing him as fast as he can and
he's doing everything he can to kill him.

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:36.666
And he's killing him in any way possible.
It's about survival out here. Period.

01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:41.333
A lion is a killing machine.
That is what he does.

01:00:41.375 --> 01:00:46.791
That is all he does. He kills. That's
how he survives and that's all he knows.

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:23.750
That would chase the flies away, for sure.
They're already gone.

01:01:28.208 --> 01:01:32.916
The only dream I've had of a lion, was
when I was on a bedtime malaria medication.

01:01:32.958 --> 01:01:37.666
I was outside of the truck.
My buddy was in the back of the truck.

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:41.833
The lion jumped into the back
of the truck to attack him,

01:01:41.875 --> 01:01:46.583
and I had my gun. So, instead of
shooting the lion to save my buddy,

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:48.083
I just shot
my buddy in the head.

01:01:49.833 --> 01:01:51.833
- I mean it's was like, what?
- A little mercy killing.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.583
Yeah. I guess I...

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:55.500
Oh, yeah, you're screwed.

01:01:55.541 --> 01:01:58.416
Something deep down
in the very core

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:05.083
of this dream is just
that Aaron is an asshole.

01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:07.375
He wants
to kill all his friends.

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:13.625
I mean, I've been told I'm an asshole by
many people. That is not something new.

01:02:13.666 --> 01:02:16.958
He kills all the other
lion hunters, then he will be left

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.750
the last and best hunter.

01:02:18.791 --> 01:02:23.208
That's right. If you
can't beat your competition,

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:25.791
kill them. Eliminate them.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.541
We have to try to
shoot one in the next two days.

01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:07.083
We need to shoot it while
we still got some hippo meat left.

01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:12.041
That is really good.

01:03:21.916 --> 01:03:25.500
Six o'clock last one.

01:03:25.541 --> 01:03:27.125
- That's a good picture.
- Yeah.

01:03:27.166 --> 01:03:30.458
Big lion. Big Simba.

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:37.625
Very long mane hair.
That's nine, ten inches long that thing.

01:03:38.791 --> 01:03:40.458
That's good hair.
Very good hair.

01:03:52.041 --> 01:03:57.333
A deep thinking hunter.
One that doesn't necessarily...

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.666
shoot every animal he sees.
I'd say that, that shot kind of

01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:07.666
will portray him in a way that it shows
the thought process of what happens

01:04:07.708 --> 01:04:11.125
when he sees an animal. He'll sit there and
he thinks about it and he contemplates it

01:04:11.166 --> 01:04:16.583
and goes through, you know, the
qualifications of what is shooting animal.

01:04:16.625 --> 01:04:18.541
So, a shot like that kind of...

01:04:19.583 --> 01:04:23.458
just, you know-- It's a good light.
It helps the viewer to, you know,

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.375
see him in an intimate way.

01:04:26.416 --> 01:04:29.416
The way that he looks at the
animal before he takes it, so.

01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:32.291
Hopefully we can
get that across.

01:04:34.375 --> 01:04:35.583
Got him!

01:04:57.666 --> 01:05:01.458
This lion is not afraid of us.
I mean it's 50 meters.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.666
He's not afraid.
Completely, not afraid.

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:12.083
From the backside,
it seems to be a big lion.

01:05:15.166 --> 01:05:16.541
He's very happy.

01:05:28.708 --> 01:05:30.250
I'll just kill hill.

01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:35.083
I just wanted
you to have a quick...

01:05:35.125 --> 01:05:36.833
It's a pretty cat,
though. Pretty animal.

01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:52.958
It ain't going to be pretty.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.416
No, he's going to be angry.

01:05:57.625 --> 01:06:02.333
It should go south pretty fast, you
know. One second, everything's under control.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:04.166
Next thing
is it's fucking haywire.

01:06:08.958 --> 01:06:12.125
When that lion's looking at you with those
yellow eyes. You know, they look through you.

01:06:12.166 --> 01:06:19.125
And you can-- you feel the presence
that is that animal. And it's special.

01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:22.291
My father took me hunting
for the first time

01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:25.541
when I was eight years, nine,
whatever I was. Eight or nine years old.

01:06:26.833 --> 01:06:30.833
He didn't have to
make me want to be a hunter.

01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:35.625
That first time I went,
I was-- it-- I was hooked

01:06:35.666 --> 01:06:38.333
like I was hooked on the
strongest drug you've ever seen.

01:06:38.375 --> 01:06:41.333
And I believe that
to be one thing. Instinct.

01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:46.833
Just because some people on
earth choose to suppress that,

01:06:46.875 --> 01:06:49.125
don't think it's not in your DNA
because you're lying to yourself.

01:06:49.166 --> 01:06:52.666
'Cause it is.
Man is the ultimate predator.

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:55.916
Man will determine
the outcome of the lion.

01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:58.916
Man will determine the outcome of
every wild living thing on this planet.

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:02.458
Man rules the world.

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:32.250
Uh, I think today
we are going to get a lion,

01:07:32.291 --> 01:07:38.375
'cause we have prepared it--
we have prepared it a lot,

01:07:38.416 --> 01:07:43.541
so it's time to get it.
Yeah, that's what I feel.

01:09:02.957 --> 01:09:05.000
What
kind of light do you have?

01:09:16.166 --> 01:09:17.666
Watching.

01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:48.125
I can't get him to stand up.
I can't shoot him laying down.

01:09:48.166 --> 01:09:53.041
It's just a bad shot.
I don't even know what to say.

01:09:57.041 --> 01:09:59.166
He's just fucking sleeping
over there now.

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:29.791
Range. Here we go.

01:10:30.916 --> 01:10:32.791
- Quick, to do, to do.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:11:01.416 --> 01:11:03.000
- We did it, man.
- The first one was perfect.

01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:04.791
Yeah. We did it.

01:11:06.875 --> 01:11:08.875
Well done.

01:11:11.875 --> 01:11:16.666
Wild-- wild lion with a bow.
Wild lion with a bow.

01:11:20.208 --> 01:11:21.541
Well done, Aaron.

01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:23.291
Thank you. Oh, man.

01:11:29.916 --> 01:11:31.833
Man, what a morning, eh?

01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:34.291
- Jeez, Louise.
- Yeah.

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:36.041
I'm glad we didn't
just get in there and whack him.

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.083
I'm glad we sat and watched him

01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:40.166
and, you know
appreciated him for a bit too.

01:11:41.791 --> 01:11:44.958
You know, I-- I don't feel bad.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.458
I feel remorseful for the life,

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.458
but, I love for-- I love it for what
I do and I love it for the opportunity

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.833
that the good lord gives us to do this
and allows us to hunt these things.

01:11:53.875 --> 01:11:54.958
And especially the lion.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.708
Wow. Alright, let's...

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:18.916
Hang on a second.
Do we need to do that again?

01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:22.291
- Well done. Well done.
- Thank you.

01:12:22.333 --> 01:12:26.500
Man that was a beautiful
old lion there. Really.

01:12:26.541 --> 01:12:28.125
- Yeah, it is.
- Well.

01:12:31.166 --> 01:12:35.208
Yeah, that's the-- That's an old
bugger, man there's no doubt.

01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:40.208
- That is exactly what we needed. Six-foot.
- Oh, man.

01:12:42.041 --> 01:12:45.125
- You shot him so well.
- That's amazing.

01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:49.750
Simba. Woo!

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.208
Thanks, guys.
Thanks, guys. Thank you.

01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:03.333
Thank you very much.

01:13:07.041 --> 01:13:09.333
We were expecting a gun.

01:13:09.375 --> 01:13:13.166
- They were listening for gunshots.
- One of you was calling.

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:15.041
- There was no gunshot.
- There was no gunshot.

01:13:17.166 --> 01:13:20.375
Then they knew you used the bow.
Both of them without hearing a gunshot.

01:13:20.416 --> 01:13:21.833
Take a picture from the side.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.291
Just do one from the side.

01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:33.375
Just watch out.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.916
Very, very important to be respectful
to the animal at all stages.

01:13:41.958 --> 01:13:44.625
You know, even when you load
them, you want to load it nice.

01:13:44.666 --> 01:13:48.375
You don't want to just throw it off the tailgate
when you get back to the skinning shed.

01:13:48.416 --> 01:13:52.291
You don't want to throw it off and dump him on
the ground. You know, you want to be respectful

01:13:52.333 --> 01:13:55.291
at all times to them, you know.
It's still, you know, an old animal

01:13:55.333 --> 01:13:58.500
and a beautiful animal.
And Yeah, respect them.

01:14:03.291 --> 01:14:05.583
Hold that.

01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:12.166
Oh, shit,
it's quite heavy.

01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:20.000
Aaron, come check
these babies out, Aaron.

01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:25.291
Ok, Let me see. Watch out guys.
Oh yeah, look at that.

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:29.625
If that thing licked you, it would tear
your skin off. Just by licking you.

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:32.291
It's for licking meat.
They can lick meat off the bone.

01:14:32.333 --> 01:14:36.375
Yeah. Look it has tiny little
teeth in its tongue Look at that.

01:14:36.416 --> 01:14:39.166
- Yeah, but, man that's a real indication...
- That's cool.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:43.166
These are rubbed flat,
these are rubbed clear to the bottom.

01:14:43.208 --> 01:14:46.000
- That's awesome.
- He did a good job.

01:14:46.041 --> 01:14:48.250
- Old man, huh?
- Good job.

01:14:48.291 --> 01:14:51.625
It can be seven or more.

01:14:51.666 --> 01:14:53.916
Eight or more. Yeah.

01:14:55.041 --> 01:14:57.791
- Behind you. That's the problem.
- I mean, I got some...

01:14:57.833 --> 01:14:59.666
Pull the tail around,
just a bit, guys.

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:01.291
Let him catch the tail.

01:15:13.166 --> 01:15:16.708
- Dude, we smoked him.
- Fucking killed him, man.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.875
- One time
- One time shoe shine.

01:15:18.916 --> 01:15:21.791
- Yeah.
- That is the one I came for, for sure.

01:15:41.666 --> 01:15:47.791
From this record, they will know how much
they are going to demand from the company.

01:15:50.708 --> 01:15:52.125
That's it.

01:16:02.333 --> 01:16:04.291
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

01:16:04.333 --> 01:16:05.333
OK, go.

01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:10.125
Back up a little bit. Okay.

01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:12.083
Then everybody's
got to run out of the way.

01:16:12.125 --> 01:16:13.875
- Further front.
- More to the front.

01:16:13.916 --> 01:16:15.958
- Go more to the front.
- Go to the front.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.541
- To the front.
- Yeah, Hold on, let me...

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.583
Stand there.

01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:24.000
You gotta go
little more to the front.

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:27.958
- I don't think it's going to happen.
- Okay. Yeah. Watch out.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Watch out. It's going down.

01:16:33.625 --> 01:16:35.916
- At least you have tried.
- Well, if you don't think you can do it,

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:38.500
let's don't do it.
You don't want to get hurt.

01:16:38.541 --> 01:16:40.708
Yeah.
I don't think my shoulders can take it.

01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:42.833
Okay, alright.
Well, fair enough.

01:16:46.291 --> 01:16:48.166
- Okay.
- Take that lion shit off.

01:16:50.166 --> 01:16:52.833
Yeah, because that-- You will never see
anything that smells worse than that.

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:55.750
- Lion shit is the bottom of the--
- Bottom of the barrel?

01:16:55.791 --> 01:16:58.208
- The bottom.
- It's got maggots in it.

01:18:48.875 --> 01:18:53.125
29 yards, uhm. Aaron stuck
him right behind the shoulder.

01:18:53.166 --> 01:18:56.958
No mess. No fuss.
No drama. Very clean kill.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.291
And yah, nice old lion there.

01:19:21.583 --> 01:19:24.500
- The last.
- You want the full kabuki?

01:19:24.541 --> 01:19:27.125
Yeah, the full kabuki?

01:19:41.125 --> 01:19:42.333
That came out pretty cool, dude.

01:19:43.791 --> 01:19:45.625
That was great, the way
he was watching us, you know.

01:19:45.666 --> 01:19:47.916
He's sitting
there and he's doing...

01:19:49.916 --> 01:19:52.250
- That was pretty funny.
- Did you see when he closed his eyes?

01:19:52.291 --> 01:19:55.625
Eyes closed, oh my god,
he's going to sleep.

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:57.500
Yeah. Once he started
licking his face and stuff, though

01:19:57.541 --> 01:19:59.375
I figured it's not
gonna be much longer now,

01:19:59.416 --> 01:20:02.458
'cause it looks like
his mouth's getting dry.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.416
He's getting bored.
He's thirsty.

01:20:04.458 --> 01:20:07.333
I'll bet you a hundred dollars
he was going to get up,

01:20:07.375 --> 01:20:10.375
look around a bit...
"yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's cool."

01:20:10.416 --> 01:20:13.583
He was going to walk and go get a drink, then
he was going to lay down and go to sleep.

01:20:30.833 --> 01:20:34.666
This is
the shipping instructions.

01:20:34.708 --> 01:20:37.500
We have the lion skull.
The lion's full skin.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:39.625
Everything is written down.

01:20:39.666 --> 01:20:45.750
- Okay.
- Then, this is the-- this is basically

01:20:48.208 --> 01:20:51.291
- This actually becomes
- Okay.
