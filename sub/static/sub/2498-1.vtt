00:54.487 --> 00:56.288
The situation on the
ground is ongoing

00:56.290 --> 01:00.826
while the entire disputed area remains
closed to news organizations.

01:00.828 --> 01:04.429
As last night's report of a
series of large explosions

01:04.431 --> 01:09.901
awaits official confirmation, widespread
fear of a biological weapons launch

01:09.903 --> 01:12.437
continues to spread
throughout the region.

01:14.575 --> 01:18.076
Justine, what are you
seeing in the capital?

01:18.078 --> 01:20.712
The Foreign Ministry remains
shuttered for a second day

01:20.714 --> 01:23.448
as evidence mounts that the
insurgents may have used

01:23.450 --> 01:27.452
at least some part of their long-rumored
biological weapons stockpile

01:27.454 --> 01:29.554
in the course of last
night's incursion.

01:29.556 --> 01:33.091
Have you been able to get any
word yet on the government's response?

01:33.493 --> 01:37.629
Well, it's hard to find any officials
here at all in the capital, Mark.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.032
But those who are willing
to speak off the record

01:40.034 --> 01:45.804
confirm the regime's plan for a massive
retaliation in the next five to seven days.

01:45.806 --> 01:49.274
Well, while we are trying
to restore that image,

01:49.276 --> 01:54.146
ITL News has just obtained amateur
video footage purporting to show

01:54.148 --> 01:57.883
casualties from last night's
exchange of missile fire.

01:57.885 --> 02:03.655
A warning... this footage contains images
that may be disturbing to some viewers.

02:03.657 --> 02:08.327
Obtained from a junior military officer
fleeing the site of last night's clashes,

02:08.329 --> 02:12.030
it seems to belie assurances
from both sides of the conflict

02:12.032 --> 02:15.267
- that no chemical or biological weapons...
- Damn it.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.902
Have been deployed.

02:16.904 --> 02:22.608
Such images are horrifying enough, but
there's an even more horrific scenario

02:23.310 --> 02:27.779
if the contagion spreads beyond the
region, potentially infecting tens...

02:27.781 --> 02:30.482
if not hundreds of thousands.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.589
- They're saying...
- Look, I'm...

02:37.591 --> 02:39.958
if you want, I'm just gonna
go to the guitar shop.

02:41.027 --> 02:43.061
The pickup fried out, so...

02:49.836 --> 02:53.105
They can't just keep
fighting, right?

02:53.107 --> 02:55.407
We are now going
live to a press conference

02:55.409 --> 02:57.442
at the Centers for Disease Control.

02:57.444 --> 03:02.013
As of 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard
Time, the CDC has not measured

03:02.015 --> 03:05.050
any airborne contaminants
beyond a 100-mile radius

03:05.052 --> 03:08.120
of last night's advance
in the Middle East.

03:08.122 --> 03:13.358
What this... what this means is the
continental United States has not

03:13.360 --> 03:17.362
and will not be affected by the
reported use of these pathogens.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.931
Steven, the
situation in the larger cities

03:19.933 --> 03:25.570
near the epicenter of the conflict remains
tense as persistent rumors of mass deaths

03:25.572 --> 03:28.473
in scores of towns and
villages gain credibility.

03:28.475 --> 03:31.676
At least three regional governments
have begun issuing gas masks...

03:31.678 --> 03:33.745
Rumors abound in the capital

03:33.747 --> 03:37.182
as the prime minister and his
cabinet depart the city...

03:38.652 --> 03:42.287
This is simply a precaution

03:42.289 --> 03:45.457
in order for us to maintain

03:45.459 --> 03:47.759
government function...

03:47.761 --> 03:50.595
Meanwhile,
a veritable exodus of refugees

03:50.597 --> 03:52.831
continues to stream
across regional borders,

03:52.833 --> 03:57.402
desperately seeking safety from a threat that
remains, perhaps intentionally, undefined.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.605
In Washington, the
president has issued a statement

04:00.607 --> 04:04.709
urging calm and affirming that no
known pathogen poses any threat...

04:04.711 --> 04:06.611
The trade winds
are spreading the pathogen

04:06.613 --> 04:08.680
well beyond the conflict's borders,

04:08.682 --> 04:11.817
confirming officials' worst
fears about the airborne virus.

04:11.819 --> 04:17.221
Reports of mass casualties as far north as
Italy and Portugal are pending confirmation.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.357
What we're
apparently seeing here is a virus,

04:19.358 --> 04:22.861
or a complex of viruses, killing
some almost immediately,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.729
while leaving others fully mobile.

04:24.731 --> 04:29.067
However, within hours, nobody in
the affected area remains alive.

04:29.069 --> 04:33.805
Stay tuned, please, for further
developments on this breaking news story.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.708
That pickup's all right.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.444
But when I move around...

04:39.446 --> 04:42.981
it doesn't have that punch
and it's just fading out a lot.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.750
- Don't worry...
- All right, so...

04:45.752 --> 04:49.688
Okay, cool. Thanks, man.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.532
He says it's gonna
be, like, an hour.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.202
There's something...

05:07.473 --> 05:10.709
- I am so hungry.
- Oh.

05:13.112 --> 05:15.947
I don't even know why
we're fighting this thing.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.917
- It was the fucking dishes.
- Yes!

05:18.919 --> 05:20.986
You guys have maids, you know?

05:20.988 --> 05:23.088
So it's not like you see a
dirty dish and you're like,

05:23.090 --> 05:25.991
"Hey, here's a dirty dish. I've
got to do something about it.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.792
I'm gonna wash this dirty dish."

05:27.794 --> 05:29.561
- You're...
- What are you... I mean...

05:29.563 --> 05:31.042
You're totally fixated on this.

05:31.068 --> 05:33.290
It's not the dish. I'm not even
talking about the dish anymore.

05:33.316 --> 05:34.332
It's a metaphor.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.835
- Yeah, it's a metaphor...
- I know what you're gonna say.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.104
- No, you don't.
- The dish is a metaphor

05:39.106 --> 05:42.140
for my anxiety about
how different we are.

05:44.577 --> 05:47.445
What?

05:47.447 --> 05:51.249
- You did know.
- Well, of course I knew.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.687
- So, fuck it.
- Just wash the dish.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.208
Just metaphor the metaphor.

05:57.234 --> 06:00.358
Just address my anxieties
with dishwashing liquid.

06:05.898 --> 06:08.033
We'd miss this if we ever lost it.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.603
We'd be like, "I wish
we could go back

06:11.605 --> 06:15.708
to when the worst thing we had
to worry about was the dishes."

06:18.578 --> 06:20.779
Hey.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.481
Hey.

06:23.483 --> 06:27.485
Oh, my God. You guys,
congratulations!

06:27.487 --> 06:32.724
Let me see. Oh, my God.
That is so adorable.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.061
So what's going on with
this shit in the news?

06:37.998 --> 06:40.732
- Honestly, I'm not watching it.
- Don't know, right?

06:40.734 --> 06:43.902
- Nothing's changed.
- I am going to go to the bathroom.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.904
Oh.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.206
Ahem.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.195
Although state
and county authorities

07:10.197 --> 07:14.065
have been almost unanimous in
urging residents to remain calm,

07:14.067 --> 07:18.236
a spreading, seemingly spontaneous
exodus along the Eastern Seaboard

07:18.238 --> 07:20.472
has caused state highway
patrol officials

07:20.474 --> 07:24.609
to shut down six major northbound
arteries, piecing together...

07:37.857 --> 07:40.692
Traffic's insane out there.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.864
Did you guys eat my food?

07:49.068 --> 07:50.969
I got you this.

08:02.883 --> 08:06.384
Anna, why have you been
so freaked out lately?

08:14.460 --> 08:18.029
So, what, I'm not allowed to talk
to any girl I've ever slept with?

08:18.031 --> 08:21.266
Are you gonna go crazy? Is that it?

08:22.803 --> 08:25.871
No, it's the exact opposite.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.540
I think you should talk to
all the people you want to...

08:28.542 --> 08:32.544
any girl you've ever met,

08:32.546 --> 08:34.712
whenever they call,
whenever they stop by,

08:34.715 --> 08:36.881
whenever you bump into them.

08:36.883 --> 08:41.586
Yeah, I think you should take as many
opportunities as possible to talk to them.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.288
Jesus, Anna.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.957
Because, God, there is so
much time, isn't there?

08:45.959 --> 08:50.228
There is so much time between
all the dishes lying around,

08:50.230 --> 08:53.631
the fucked-up amps,
the fried-out pickups,

08:53.633 --> 08:56.201
your rich grandparents...

08:56.203 --> 08:58.903
and your boring,
stupid ex-girlfriends

08:58.905 --> 09:02.173
coming to the "Gates
of fucking India"?

09:02.175 --> 09:04.476
You know?

09:04.478 --> 09:08.046
Because between all that,

09:08.048 --> 09:11.649
there's so much time for...

09:11.651 --> 09:13.852
laying in the bathtub...

09:15.755 --> 09:18.289
and reading the soap bottle...

09:20.260 --> 09:23.762
and looking out together,
up at the leaves...

09:24.930 --> 09:27.398
and holding each other,

09:27.400 --> 09:31.669
because we're both so happy

09:31.671 --> 09:34.372
that we're actually scared.

09:39.945 --> 09:44.883
Because if it really is all over...

09:44.885 --> 09:47.285
Erik, if it was just us,

09:47.287 --> 09:51.689
and there really was
nothing left on Earth...

09:57.863 --> 10:00.799
What are you doing?

10:00.801 --> 10:03.201
No, Anna, Anna,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.436
That's the song.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.106
That... that is the song.

10:08.108 --> 10:12.076
Those are the lyrics to our song.

10:12.078 --> 10:14.078
That's it.

10:15.581 --> 10:17.982
It's gonna be beautiful.

10:32.765 --> 10:36.768
No one is willing to
confirm or deny what we're seeing here.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.670
It clearly isn't benign.

10:38.672 --> 10:42.040
Even at this distance, David,
I've got to admit, I'm scared.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.108
We're getting
unconfirmed reports of rioting

10:44.110 --> 10:48.012
at dozens of airports as all domestic and
international flights remain grounded.

10:48.014 --> 10:51.282
Hundreds of
thousands of people are now running

10:51.284 --> 10:53.451
through the streets here
seeking any kind of shelter.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.687
The president and
his cabinet have been evacuated

10:55.689 --> 10:59.457
to an undisclosed location while
assuring local authorities...

10:59.459 --> 11:01.392
as yet
another American city reports

11:01.394 --> 11:04.162
an almost unbelievable
casualty rate...

11:04.164 --> 11:07.832
I, the Lord, have held
My peace a long time...

11:07.834 --> 11:10.802
Just in the last
several minutes, it's really...

11:10.804 --> 11:13.137
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

11:13.139 --> 11:15.273
We are no longer receiving reports

11:15.275 --> 11:17.842
from the following cities
and municipalities...

11:17.844 --> 11:20.678
Boston and the Boston
metropolitan area,

11:20.680 --> 11:24.415
- Bridgeport and the...
- Philadelphia...

11:24.417 --> 11:26.885
- Baltimore...
- "Then the fifth angel

11:26.887 --> 11:29.053
poured out his bowel
on the throne of the beast,

11:29.055 --> 11:31.656
and His kingdom became
full of darkness

11:31.658 --> 11:34.525
and they gnawed their tongues
because of the pain..."

11:34.527 --> 11:37.629
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my God.

11:37.631 --> 11:42.467
- Oh, my God.
- "They shall become refuse on the ground."

12:02.788 --> 12:06.557
The following is a bulletin from
the Emergency Management Agency.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.527
If concentrations in your area have
exceeded 80 parts per billion,

12:09.529 --> 12:14.599
you must take immediate shelter and remain
where you are for a minimum of eight days.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.168
State authorities will continue
to broadcast hourly updates

12:17.170 --> 12:20.004
as long as emergency networks
remain operational.

12:24.276 --> 12:27.645
What does that even mean,
"parts per billion"?

12:27.647 --> 12:30.448
Per billion what?

12:30.450 --> 12:34.252
Per billion of whatever else
was out there, I guess.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.460
It's a beautiful day.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.698
Not a cloud in the sky.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.538
We could read something.

12:56.408 --> 12:57.542
Sure.

13:17.696 --> 13:20.098
Remember this?

13:21.333 --> 13:23.334
Oh, that.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.104
That was a moment of weakness.

13:33.312 --> 13:37.181
Well, at least we're not
going to get divorced now.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.450
It's so clear out, baby.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.387
The birds up there, they're
just flying around.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.923
It's too bad we aren't birds.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.159
I wonder what they're feeling.

13:48.161 --> 13:52.030
Like their favorite
TV show got canceled.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.738
I could talk to you
for another 20 years.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.473
Aw, shut up.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.343
I mean it. I was just
thinking it the other day.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.579
I just realized that...

14:08.581 --> 14:11.549
that you're my wife.

14:11.551 --> 14:17.288
It took me practically till
just now to really believe it.

14:47.419 --> 14:49.687
We're going to have
to go to Children's.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.825
What?

14:56.628 --> 15:00.064
There are no more canisters here.

15:05.404 --> 15:09.440
We're going to have to go
to Children's Hospital.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.442
Okay.

15:32.397 --> 15:35.133
- Oh, my God.
- Don't look.

15:35.135 --> 15:39.036
Oh, God. That looks like...

15:39.038 --> 15:41.506
that sweet nurse in Cardiology.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.041
Sarah. Her name was Sarah.

15:44.043 --> 15:46.744
Sarah.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.148
Sarah? Sarah. Sarah.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.683
- Mr. Sachs, I...
- Wait a minute.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.886
Look, I know you're busy, but
I need a favor from you.

16:28.888 --> 16:32.356
It's for my wife. She's in there
waiting to see Dr. Henderson.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.991
They took her off life support.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.994
They took her out of ICU.
We're just waiting, Sarah.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.529
Well, we have an emergency...

16:38.531 --> 16:40.898
Well, this is an emergency!
You understand?!

16:40.900 --> 16:44.035
This is an emergency,
Sarah! She's dying!

16:44.037 --> 16:47.305
And the doctor's just taken
a three-hour coffee break.

16:49.241 --> 16:51.409
- Mr. Sachs...
- I'm sorry.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.644
I know you're a good person.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.646
Esther and I really think of you

16:55.648 --> 16:59.317
as someone close to us,
like you're really family.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.220
Please, I'm begging you.
Just come with me.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.122
Help me. Help me get her
to ICU. Come on.

17:05.124 --> 17:09.359
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do
that. We have an emergency... Mr. Sachs?

17:09.362 --> 17:12.029
Mr. Sachs!

17:12.031 --> 17:13.698
Jacob! Get me an oxygen unit.

17:13.700 --> 17:18.135
- Jacob, get me an oxygen unit, now.
- Yes, right.

17:20.673 --> 17:24.008
Mr. Sachs? Lift your
head up for me.

17:29.248 --> 17:31.582
Try to breathe normally.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.354
- Okay?
- Yeah.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.289
- I've gotta go.
- Wait, wait.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.325
Listen to me.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.527
It's a biological attack.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.396
- Isn't it?
- They don't know.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.998
People can't breathe...

17:47.000 --> 17:49.200
old people...

17:49.202 --> 17:50.301
kids...

17:50.303 --> 17:52.603
animals are okay.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.273
We only have about three hours...

18:00.045 --> 18:04.282
It has to do with how much
material is in the air.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.450
And winds and...

18:06.452 --> 18:09.987
if it gets up to more than
35 parts per billion,

18:09.989 --> 18:13.557
you're going to need one of
these to survive, Sarah.

18:13.559 --> 18:16.327
Now listen to me. Listen.
You got to get one.

18:16.329 --> 18:20.364
Not a charcoal filter. Pure oxygen.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.301
You'll be able to last
eight days. Okay?

18:23.303 --> 18:26.637
Thank you. Thank you very much.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.739
Good luck.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.776
Nurse!

18:35.013 --> 18:36.347
I have to go!

18:44.156 --> 18:45.823
"Connect me to something.

18:45.825 --> 18:49.593
Give me something,"
I said. You know?

18:49.595 --> 18:51.796
"Give me something, Counsel.

18:51.798 --> 18:56.300
Give me something that connects
my client eating baba ghanoush

18:56.302 --> 18:58.736
at some streetside cafe

18:58.738 --> 19:01.839
somewhere in...

19:01.841 --> 19:05.142
do we even know where
this was taken, Tracy?"

19:05.144 --> 19:07.011
And then Tracy said...

19:07.013 --> 19:11.549
And then I said, "No, the prosecution
just gave us Exhibit 345,

19:11.551 --> 19:14.685
defendants Hightower,
Esselen, and Sachs

19:14.687 --> 19:18.789
and 'unidentified man.' 1979."

19:20.125 --> 19:25.262
"So, please. Help me out here,"
I said, looking sort of baffled.

19:25.264 --> 19:30.534
"Give me whatever it is you're hanging your
case on so that I can defend my client.

19:30.536 --> 19:34.772
But don't keep giving me
exhibit after exhibit,

19:34.774 --> 19:37.041
so-called 'fact' after
so-called 'fact'

19:37.043 --> 19:40.544
that doesn't add up
to A... trade secrets,

19:40.546 --> 19:45.383
B... any of your employees actually
compromising your trade secrets, or C...

19:45.385 --> 19:48.753
any material damages done to your
company's overseas interests,

19:48.755 --> 19:52.256
because if opposing
counsel doesn't or can't,

19:52.258 --> 19:54.725
or for whatever
reason, they won't...

19:56.328 --> 19:58.162
Your Honor, I respectfully request

19:58.164 --> 20:01.932
that you dismiss the
case against my client."

20:03.068 --> 20:06.470
And the judge dismissed it.

20:11.277 --> 20:14.145
You guys? We're...

20:14.147 --> 20:16.547
we're evacuating the building.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.455
The news, then a proliferation

20:24.457 --> 20:27.925
of rumors and hearsay, and then
almost street by street...

20:27.927 --> 20:30.461
Hey, man. Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.467
Hey, man. I'm leaving
a message, dude.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.503
Did you... if you're watching TV,

20:39.505 --> 20:41.573
there's a...

20:43.442 --> 20:45.543
anyway, turn on the TV.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.445
It has something to
do with the war.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.114
We're supposed to...

20:52.084 --> 20:54.485
conflicting reports
of trade winds...

20:54.487 --> 20:57.555
So, um...

20:57.557 --> 20:59.390
meet me back at the house.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.659
And...

21:01.661 --> 21:04.962
please change your outgoing
message, though, baby.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.664
Seriously.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.532
But efforts to keep citizens calm

21:08.534 --> 21:10.801
and encourage them to
maintain their normal...

21:10.803 --> 21:13.103
I'm gonna take you
left, then right...

21:13.105 --> 21:14.839
- Ah!
- Busted!

21:14.841 --> 21:17.541
Surprise myself!

21:17.543 --> 21:19.610
Ah! Take it back right here.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.746
And then I'm gonna score again.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.653
Perfect defense.

21:31.356 --> 21:33.858
Oh, yeah! That's game, baby!

21:33.860 --> 21:35.459
- No, no, no.
- That's game.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.728
No.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.898
Okay, so here's the deal.

21:40.900 --> 21:45.236
If I sink this, right here,
you let me pay you back.

21:46.538 --> 21:48.372
You don't owe me anything, man.

21:48.374 --> 21:52.276
You see, that's exactly the kind of talk
that won't be allowed if I make this shot.

21:56.314 --> 21:58.115
What happens if you miss?

21:58.117 --> 22:00.150
Uh...

22:01.920 --> 22:04.355
You know, this is really gonna
determine my inner morality.

22:04.357 --> 22:07.191
If I miss, then you never
have to hear about it again.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.126
How's that? Okay?

22:09.128 --> 22:11.929
Borrowed your Jeep, fucked up
the transmission, we're square.

22:11.931 --> 22:15.165
But if I make it, you
accept the cash.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.005
All right, I'll trust
your subconscious.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.607
You hear that, Rick's subconscious?

22:23.609 --> 22:26.377
You don't really want him
to make this shot, do ya?

22:26.379 --> 22:29.113
Make him miss.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.015
You're just... you're
gonna stand right there?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.783
You never said anything
about where I could stand.

22:32.785 --> 22:35.185
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.887
It doesn't really matter.
That doesn't bother me.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.489
- 'Cause you know why?
- Why?

22:38.491 --> 22:40.658
'Cause I got it like that.

22:47.632 --> 22:48.766
I give up.

23:00.745 --> 23:02.846
Nice work on the Sachs case.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.848
Thanks.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.485
Where are you going?

23:08.487 --> 23:10.921
Home.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.190
That's it?

23:13.192 --> 23:15.125
That's it.

23:17.862 --> 23:20.331
Whatever.

23:24.570 --> 23:28.772
Let's not end this on a bad note.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.709
You're a wonderful guy,

23:31.711 --> 23:35.179
and who knows what
would have happened

23:35.181 --> 23:37.381
if we had met before.

23:37.383 --> 23:40.751
But it was never a question.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.287
There was in my mind.

23:46.424 --> 23:48.392
I'm sorry.

23:53.865 --> 23:56.266
It's the end of the world.

23:58.536 --> 24:03.374
If it really is the end of the
world, how funny, you know?

24:03.376 --> 24:07.745
For once, it really would
be when it feels that way.

24:07.747 --> 24:11.048
How romantic.

24:17.822 --> 24:20.124
Anyway, turn on the TV.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.427
It has something to do
with the war.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.496
Meet me back at the house

24:25.498 --> 24:29.967
and please change your outgoing
message, though, baby.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.604
- Come on, come on. Let's go.
- Seriously.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.873
I'm starting to tighten
up a little bit.

24:38.376 --> 24:40.344
Let's go.

24:42.347 --> 24:43.647
What?

24:43.649 --> 24:45.816
She told me to turn on the TV.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.252
- She wants me
to meet her at home. - Now?

24:50.388 --> 24:52.189
Yeah.

24:53.491 --> 24:56.360
- So you're...?
- Sorry, man.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.896
You know what, man?
You are so fuckin' whipped.

24:58.898 --> 25:03.333
Hey, I canceled a lot of shit for
this so we can just hang out.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.436
Yeah? Like what?

25:05.438 --> 25:06.870
Coffee at Saga?

25:06.872 --> 25:09.006
Tarot card reading?

25:09.008 --> 25:11.308
- Yeah.
- I'll see you on Thursday.

25:11.310 --> 25:14.478
- You gotta be kiddin' me.
- I'll see you Thursday, man.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.580
Yeah, fuck you, motherfucker.

25:16.582 --> 25:19.116
- Thursday.
- If you're lucky.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.158
God damn it.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.201
Hey.

25:39.437 --> 25:41.805
I finished the song.

25:46.311 --> 25:48.479
I have an idea.

25:52.450 --> 25:57.387
Why don't we take a nap, just
forget about everything?

26:02.761 --> 26:06.263
Listen to this.

26:07.966 --> 26:10.400
"The souls of all my dears

26:10.402 --> 26:12.369
have flown to the stars.

26:12.371 --> 26:16.240
Thank God there's no one
left for me to lose."

26:17.242 --> 26:19.243
Hm.

26:30.355 --> 26:33.690
You know what your
grandmother said to me?

26:33.692 --> 26:35.225
Mm.

26:36.895 --> 26:39.596
She said...

26:39.598 --> 26:43.767
that "the only important language

26:43.769 --> 26:45.936
spoken in the world

26:45.938 --> 26:48.872
is spoken between

26:48.874 --> 26:52.676
a man and a woman.

26:52.678 --> 26:55.212
In bed."

27:07.125 --> 27:09.459
I don't know. Maybe you
want to watch the news?

27:09.461 --> 27:13.597
- Nuh-uh.
- Or write some more poetry?

27:13.599 --> 27:16.066
No.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.936
You know what? We should probably
get up and do the dishes.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.938
No, I don't think so.

27:55.273 --> 27:56.540
And so, finally...

27:56.542 --> 27:58.275
eight years later or whatever...

27:58.277 --> 28:00.244
at some New Year's Eve party,

28:00.246 --> 28:03.447
Grandpa finally got up the
courage and he kissed her.

28:05.083 --> 28:08.051
At least, that's how my
mom used to tell it.

28:19.130 --> 28:21.398
They're gonna love you. Seriously.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.433
Don't worry about it.

28:25.069 --> 28:27.471
I'm not worried, baby.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.890
- Hello!
- Hi!

28:46.892 --> 28:48.558
- Hello!
- Hi!

28:48.560 --> 28:51.762
I'm so glad to meet you.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.630
I'm so happy to meet you, too.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.766
Yes! Goodness! Ooh!

28:55.768 --> 28:59.937
Someone did very well.
This is a beautiful ring.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.972
- That's right.
- He did very great.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.640
How are you, sweetheart?

29:04.943 --> 29:08.078
Men are so much like
kids, it's silly.

29:08.080 --> 29:13.517
I mean, there's the guitar
and there's the garden

29:13.519 --> 29:16.053
and there's basketball
and football...

29:16.055 --> 29:21.091
it's a wonder they have any time
at all to devote themselves

29:21.093 --> 29:24.528
to other responsibilities
for family.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.563
But they do. They do.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.865
- Yeah.
- Bless 'em.

29:28.867 --> 29:30.500
You know.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.936
I'm gonna have to
sit down, I think.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.938
- I just got a little pooped.
- Yeah, sure.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.208
What you've gotta watch, of course,
is when you breed something

29:38.210 --> 29:40.444
more and more specialized,

29:40.446 --> 29:43.013
it can only survive
under very narrow

29:43.015 --> 29:45.349
and specific conditions.

29:47.018 --> 29:48.518
Here.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.154
Thank you.

29:51.156 --> 29:53.824
- Got something for you.
- No, Grandpa, I'm fine.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.025
- No, no, no.
- I'm fine.

29:55.027 --> 29:56.793
No, no, you can't refuse me.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.229
You just can't. I'm not gonna
take no for an answer,

29:59.231 --> 30:02.432
- so you might as well just stop.
- Okay.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.835
And I wanna tell you something...

30:04.837 --> 30:07.037
man to man, okay?

30:12.110 --> 30:14.411
No matter how much
a woman may tell you

30:14.413 --> 30:16.279
that she's happy to support you,

30:16.281 --> 30:19.249
that she's not interested
in material things,

30:19.251 --> 30:21.184
she wants you to be free...

30:21.186 --> 30:24.054
sooner or later, they all
want the good things in life.

30:24.056 --> 30:27.124
- I know, I know. But Anna isn't like that.
- Well, I'm sure she's not.

30:27.126 --> 30:29.793
I'm not telling you
that she's shallow.

30:29.795 --> 30:33.530
Probably is the most natural,
basic instinct in a woman...

30:33.532 --> 30:37.901
actually, any human being...
make a home,

30:37.903 --> 30:40.237
make a nest.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.741
You know, I'm playing
a show at this thing.

30:44.743 --> 30:46.376
It's called "South by Southwest."

30:46.378 --> 30:49.413
And you know there's a lot of...

30:49.415 --> 30:51.848
record company people,
and managers go.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.418
That's wonderful.

30:56.387 --> 30:59.856
- I can make a living playing music.
- I'm sure you can.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.225
And I'm sure you'll figure it out.

31:02.227 --> 31:04.895
Don't let anybody
pressure you, huh?

31:04.897 --> 31:06.696
Just take your time.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.566
If there's anything ever
I can do to help you,

31:09.568 --> 31:11.568
you know I'm here.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.873
So funny... I was just
thinking this morning

31:16.875 --> 31:20.844
that, God, I have turned
into such a typical "girl."

31:20.846 --> 31:24.815
I never thought
it would happen to me,

31:24.817 --> 31:26.917
but I... oh, God...

31:26.919 --> 31:29.352
I am completely obsessed with him.

31:29.354 --> 31:31.388
Beyond obsessed with him.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.091
I mean, even when
I'm angry or jealous

31:34.093 --> 31:37.294
or, I don't know...
maybe that's the same thing...

31:37.296 --> 31:41.131
but he leaves for an hour
and I can't stand it.

31:41.133 --> 31:44.067
I don't know
what to do with myself.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.336
I feel kind of crazy and...

31:46.338 --> 31:49.473
that can't be healthy.

31:49.475 --> 31:54.911
Well, I'm not sure it's healthy,
but it is the way it is.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.980
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

31:56.982 --> 31:59.249
And I'll tell you something else.

31:59.251 --> 32:02.252
You'd be someplace at a party

32:02.254 --> 32:04.688
or a friend's house or something...

32:04.690 --> 32:09.259
and he'll be over there
talking to somebody.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.195
And you see his face.

32:12.197 --> 32:14.598
And you think,

32:14.600 --> 32:18.802
"He and I are going to make
some beautiful babies."

32:21.906 --> 32:24.107
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.279
You know what? I don't
think I can take this.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.648
No, no. I told you I'm not
taking no for an answer.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.683
- No, Grandpa, I can't.
- Oh, Erik, come on. I got it, you need it.

32:33.685 --> 32:37.187
- What's the difference?
- I always appreciate...

32:37.189 --> 32:39.756
I am not taking it back.
That's final.

32:45.129 --> 32:47.264
- I'm sorry.
- Idiot.

32:47.266 --> 32:50.901
You're too good for my dirty money?

32:50.903 --> 32:53.403
You think there wouldn't be such a
thing as war if it wasn't for me?

32:53.405 --> 32:56.139
I got news for you, kid. There
are worse sinners on this earth

32:56.141 --> 32:58.041
- than your grandfather.
- No, no, no. I don't...

32:58.043 --> 33:00.143
Wait till you have a child!

33:00.145 --> 33:02.312
Wait till you have a sick child!

33:02.314 --> 33:04.781
Then you'll lecture me.

33:08.452 --> 33:11.755
And if you have any trouble
at all remembering

33:11.757 --> 33:13.356
or if you aren't sure
of your answer,

33:13.358 --> 33:14.991
just say, "I don't remember,"

33:14.993 --> 33:16.826
or, "I don't have
any specific recollection."

33:16.828 --> 33:19.329
Now, that last one actually
covers quite a lot.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.632
If, for instance, you "sort of"
think you might remember something,

33:22.634 --> 33:25.735
but it's possible that you
aren't remembering it clearly,

33:25.737 --> 33:29.472
it's never perjury to say, "I don't
have any specific recollection."

33:29.474 --> 33:33.710
They were developing a pathogen.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.579
I know, Mr. Sachs.

33:35.581 --> 33:38.215
But the prosecution won't be
asking about that tonight.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.617
It wasn't even my division.

33:40.619 --> 33:45.689
I offered advice to my clients
on pharmaceutical lines.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.557
Okay.

33:49.360 --> 33:54.097
We have about 15 minutes
until opening statements.

33:54.099 --> 33:56.866
They just offered me so much money.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.803
So much. Millions.

34:01.505 --> 34:04.007
Okay. Mr. Sachs, look at me.

34:07.411 --> 34:11.380
This trial is not about
how certain governments

34:11.382 --> 34:14.918
got a hold of certain weapons
or formulas for weapons

34:14.920 --> 34:17.420
over 30 years ago.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.989
This trial deals with
the very narrow issue

34:19.992 --> 34:22.492
of whether or not
you violated your contract

34:22.494 --> 34:24.860
with Sichel Systems
by revealing trade secrets,

34:24.862 --> 34:27.630
and you didn't do that.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.833
You didn't break the
terms of your contract.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.502
You're innocent.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.737
Have you had a child?

34:37.541 --> 34:41.543
- No.
- You can't watch them die.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.181
She lived another 15 years

34:45.183 --> 34:47.917
and she gave us our grandson, Erik.

34:47.918 --> 34:52.022
But the prosecution doesn't
need to know that, do they?

34:52.024 --> 34:54.623
I took it.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.560
I took the money.

34:57.562 --> 35:01.364
I knew it was wrong, but I took it.

35:02.667 --> 35:07.037
My wife is living in denial,
but I know it's my fault.

35:08.072 --> 35:10.674
I deserve to be punished.

35:17.181 --> 35:20.417
We really need to leave, Mr. Sachs.

35:30.561 --> 35:33.096
Oh, my God.

35:33.098 --> 35:35.532
Oh... it's too far.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.567
We'll get there, we'll get there.

35:37.569 --> 35:41.771
Hold on. If we can find some
more canisters up there,

35:41.773 --> 35:45.408
it's gonna get us
eight days of air,

35:45.410 --> 35:47.877
and the poison will be gone.

35:52.951 --> 35:57.087
To think I was so scared
about having that operation.

35:57.089 --> 35:59.556
And Dr. Henderson died...

35:59.558 --> 36:01.124
Esther, if you're
going to go through

36:01.126 --> 36:02.959
all the ironies of the situation,

36:02.961 --> 36:05.228
we're going to be talking another
20 years. You know that?

36:05.230 --> 36:08.331
I won't say a word. I don't
ever want to say anything.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.767
What? What did you say?

36:10.769 --> 36:13.470
Excuse me?

36:13.472 --> 36:15.739
You don't want to say anything?

36:15.741 --> 36:19.509
Huh? You don't wanna
say anything...

36:19.511 --> 36:22.579
about my pants?

36:22.581 --> 36:26.416
Something about my pants?

36:26.418 --> 36:29.419
They're too high.

36:29.421 --> 36:32.956
Okay, here we go.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.325
Have you been looking for a job?

36:35.327 --> 36:36.826
Yeah, I've been looking for a job.

36:36.828 --> 36:39.829
I print out another
175,000 resumes,

36:39.831 --> 36:43.266
I change my profile on
another million job sites.

36:43.268 --> 36:45.769
- I mean, the thing is...
- I even call Human Resources.

36:45.771 --> 36:48.004
I swear to God, I feel like
"Willy Loman." I said...

36:49.841 --> 36:53.576
"If anything comes
up, do me a favor.

36:53.578 --> 36:56.146
Keep my number. Give me a call."

36:57.748 --> 36:59.382
I mean, you were
getting plenty of work

36:59.384 --> 37:01.217
when you were putting
her through law school.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.052
Yeah. People used to hire writers.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.555
You can get any job you want.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.424
Yeah. One more job.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.759
Pay some bills.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.961
Buy some stuff, get another job,

37:11.963 --> 37:13.830
pay some more bills,
buy some more stuff...

37:13.832 --> 37:16.266
Yeah, but it's that or what?

37:16.268 --> 37:19.102
Play basketball
with your buddies all day

37:19.104 --> 37:21.438
and let Mia buy your shirts?

37:23.741 --> 37:26.009
You know what's interesting
to me, is that why...

37:26.011 --> 37:28.111
instead of printing
a bunch of resumes,

37:28.113 --> 37:29.579
why we all don't just stop

37:29.581 --> 37:33.550
in the middle of
the street and say...

37:33.552 --> 37:35.552
"What the hell is going on here?

37:35.554 --> 37:37.120
What is this all about?"

37:37.122 --> 37:40.657
I mean, why am I here on
this earth, you know?

37:40.659 --> 37:42.725
- Oh, Len...
- No, I mean it. I mean it.

37:42.727 --> 37:46.129
Why does the universe
expand for eternity?

37:46.131 --> 37:47.263
Wh-why...

37:47.265 --> 37:48.865
how much longer am I gonna live?

37:48.867 --> 37:51.401
Why am I the only animal
that knows it's gonna die?

37:51.403 --> 37:53.503
We all asked ourselves
those questions

37:53.505 --> 37:55.605
when we were, like, eight.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.373
Yeah, but why did we
stop asking, you know?

37:57.375 --> 37:59.442
'Cause I never got any answers.

38:03.348 --> 38:05.048
Is this about the war?

38:09.054 --> 38:12.155
This is about what I'm supposed
to be doing with my life.

38:15.726 --> 38:17.994
I just don't know what I'm
supposed to tell Dad.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.463
Oh, God, Sarah. Tell him I'm happy.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.465
I mean, you tell me...
X-ray vision...

38:22.467 --> 38:24.267
am I horribly depressed?

38:29.773 --> 38:32.575
You know what I just
realized the other day?

38:34.011 --> 38:35.645
We're at some party at Mia's office

38:35.647 --> 38:38.581
and we'd just gotten
in some stupid fight

38:38.583 --> 38:41.618
and we're outside
in the parking lot.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.953
And I just realized that...

38:46.090 --> 38:48.091
she's my wife.

38:50.594 --> 38:52.795
And I love her.

38:54.298 --> 38:56.699
I mean, I really love her.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.435
She married me...

38:59.437 --> 39:02.305
so I can't really be
that depressed, can I?

39:03.507 --> 39:04.974
God.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.644
I hope I meet someone
like you someday.

39:07.646 --> 39:10.046
- Except with a job.
- Except with a job.

39:21.259 --> 39:23.660
Come on.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.302
Come on!

39:40.477 --> 39:42.912
Fuck.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.957
Shit.

40:30.961 --> 40:34.030
Mia? Sarah, what the
fuck is going on?

40:34.032 --> 40:36.966
Listen... they're not telling
the whole story on the news.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.402
Well, I haven't seen the news.
What's going on?

40:39.404 --> 40:41.471
Just ignore what
everybody's saying.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.139
You have to get back to the house.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.475
Get out your dehumidifiers
and ionizers...

40:45.477 --> 40:49.112
anything you have that filters air...
and seal yourself into the basement.

40:49.114 --> 40:52.749
What... what is it?
Is this the war?

40:52.751 --> 40:56.085
Just listen. Remember how we put
Mom's oxygen tanks up in the attic?

40:56.087 --> 40:58.421
Yeah. I got rid of those
months ago, Sarah.

40:58.423 --> 41:00.657
Damn.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.426
Well, just stay down there
as long as you can.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.128
I'm starting to freak
out here, Sarah.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.497
What's going on?
How do you know all this?

41:07.499 --> 41:10.867
Because I... I met someone
who knows about this,

41:10.869 --> 41:13.770
- and I...
- Hey, Sarah?

41:13.772 --> 41:16.205
Sarah, listen to me, okay?

41:18.008 --> 41:20.076
What the fuck? Hold on a second.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.845
I gotta give you a call back,
okay? I'm gonna call you back.

41:22.847 --> 41:25.815
Stay safe.

41:30.054 --> 41:34.023
Attention, please.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.626
There has been an emergency
reported in the building.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.761
Leave the building immediately

41:38.763 --> 41:41.230
using marked stairways and exits.

41:41.232 --> 41:43.099
Do not use elevators.

41:45.769 --> 41:48.971
Hey, buddy.

41:48.973 --> 41:52.008
Do you know where your
mommy and daddy are?

41:53.343 --> 41:55.111
You okay?

41:55.113 --> 41:57.847
Using marked stairways and exits.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.316
Do not use elevators.

42:02.353 --> 42:05.288
Attention, please.
Attention, please.

42:05.290 --> 42:08.691
There has been an emergency
reported in the building.

42:08.693 --> 42:12.295
Leave the building immediately
using marked stairways...

42:12.297 --> 42:14.697
It hurts.

42:14.699 --> 42:17.600
What hurts?

42:17.602 --> 42:19.102
My tummy.

42:19.104 --> 42:22.739
Where does it hurt? Hmm?

42:22.741 --> 42:24.073
It...

42:24.075 --> 42:26.175
Okay, okay, buddy. Okay.

42:26.177 --> 42:28.277
Uh...

42:28.279 --> 42:30.113
we're gonna...

42:30.115 --> 42:32.515
What the fuck are you doing?

42:32.517 --> 42:35.284
- Hey...
- Get the fuck away from my boy!

42:35.286 --> 42:38.488
Hey, man, it's okay.
Your kid is not doing...

42:38.490 --> 42:40.289
hey, whoa!

42:40.291 --> 42:42.692
Hey, hey... hey, listen!

42:42.694 --> 42:44.927
Jesus Christ! Hey, listen, man!

42:44.929 --> 42:47.063
- Listen!
- Fuck you...

42:47.065 --> 42:49.098
- Daddy!
- Damn it! Listen!

42:51.035 --> 42:53.035
Listen!

42:53.037 --> 42:55.304
Jesus Christ, man! Stop!

42:55.306 --> 42:57.974
Listen to me.

42:57.976 --> 43:00.176
Take care of your son!

43:28.840 --> 43:31.908
Hey, do you have any Goldfish?

43:31.910 --> 43:33.576
- Um...
- Yes, Goldfish.

43:33.578 --> 43:36.379
Maybe up there.

43:36.381 --> 43:39.015
Thanks.

43:39.017 --> 43:40.917
Uh...?

43:42.419 --> 43:44.420
Wow.

43:44.422 --> 43:46.722
Do you think that they

43:46.724 --> 43:48.925
stuffed everything up
like that for the party?

43:48.927 --> 43:52.161
No, I think that is just how
they keep their things.

43:52.163 --> 43:54.163
- You know what's weird about that?
- What?

43:54.165 --> 43:56.499
Oh, shh... Oreos.

43:56.501 --> 43:58.434
- Look at this.
- Mmm.

43:58.436 --> 44:00.436
- Mmm.
- Mmm, mmm.

44:01.906 --> 44:04.607
Yummy, yummy.

44:06.410 --> 44:08.177
What's...

44:08.179 --> 44:10.313
- What's weird?
- Huh?

44:10.315 --> 44:12.148
- What's weird about it?
- What's weird, what's weird.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.884
- You said...
- It was...

44:14.886 --> 44:19.222
I don't know. It's just weird...
ever since we got engaged,

44:19.224 --> 44:21.657
there's suddenly like all these...

44:21.659 --> 44:23.659
I don't know, these
waves that we...

44:23.661 --> 44:25.494
No. I know exactly what you mean.

44:25.496 --> 44:30.199
There's, like, a right way and a wrong way
of doing everything, and we're, like...

44:30.201 --> 44:35.605
You know why? It's 'cause we're, like,
we are like, the Anna and Erik tribe.

44:35.607 --> 44:38.941
You know? And I mean there's
something terribly wrong

44:38.943 --> 44:41.978
about putting the... look, the
cat food next to the tea.

44:44.281 --> 44:45.848
Yeah, but probably the
way we stack things

44:45.850 --> 44:50.586
and put things together really neatly
seems completely insane and constricting.

44:51.688 --> 44:54.690
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

44:54.692 --> 45:00.029
I mean it already feels so wrong to do
it any other way than the way we do it.

45:00.531 --> 45:05.902
Right, but that is how
it begins, you know?

45:05.904 --> 45:08.804
That is why countries
invade each other...

45:08.806 --> 45:11.340
'cause of that.

45:15.647 --> 45:17.513
"You don't put the tea
in the right place."

45:17.515 --> 45:20.316
Yeah? Fuck you! Fuck you,
you're the bad guys.

45:20.318 --> 45:22.084
You have no idea how to
do it, and we're better.

45:22.086 --> 45:23.686
"You know what? The green
tea goes on the top shelf

45:23.688 --> 45:26.355
next to the cocoa, fuckwad,
or I'm gonna kill you."

45:26.357 --> 45:30.493
The beginning of civilization.

45:30.495 --> 45:32.495
I'm sorry. I have got to move this.

45:32.497 --> 45:36.899
- No, I mean, it so doesn't belong there.
- There is something immoral about it.

45:36.901 --> 45:40.202
- We'd be hypocrites if we fail that.
- Future generations will thank us.

45:40.204 --> 45:42.405
The products of this apartment
will cry out for liberation.

45:42.407 --> 45:46.476
It will be a beacon of proper shelf
arrangement for the entire region.

45:50.580 --> 45:53.416
Oh, my God. So good.

45:53.418 --> 45:56.619
I can't find the Goldfish.

45:58.856 --> 46:01.691
He was up there. God.

47:11.496 --> 47:14.196
I hear you.

49:24.361 --> 49:25.694
Hi.

49:28.131 --> 49:30.799
Hi.

49:32.536 --> 49:35.938
- Was I talking to myself?
- No.

49:38.475 --> 49:42.678
I've been feeling so weird
these past few days.

49:44.648 --> 49:47.249
You know...

49:48.051 --> 49:50.252
I see stuff.

49:50.254 --> 49:54.290
Out of the corner
of my eye sometimes.

49:57.027 --> 50:01.463
I don't even tell my boyfriend...

50:02.632 --> 50:05.201
my fiancé.

50:08.238 --> 50:11.273
And these past few days, I...

50:11.275 --> 50:14.210
I mean literally,

50:14.212 --> 50:17.379
last night, for a second,

50:17.381 --> 50:22.518
it was like there was
nobody left anywhere...

50:25.255 --> 50:28.757
except animals.

50:30.427 --> 50:33.295
Running down the middle
of the street.

50:35.266 --> 50:38.767
God, and Erik was like,

50:38.769 --> 50:41.403
"What?

50:41.405 --> 50:44.707
What are you staring at?"

50:52.082 --> 50:54.617
You didn't say?

51:00.457 --> 51:03.125
They say schizophrenia starts

51:03.127 --> 51:07.696
when you're, like,

51:07.698 --> 51:10.966
19 to 25.

51:10.968 --> 51:12.501
You hear voices?

51:18.642 --> 51:23.045
Well, I just heard a bunch of crows

51:23.047 --> 51:26.415
screaming "War! War!"

51:26.417 --> 51:28.384
Well, they aren't telling you

51:28.386 --> 51:31.086
to jump off any
high buildings, right?

51:31.088 --> 51:33.622
No.

51:33.624 --> 51:35.524
Good.

51:36.893 --> 51:40.129
My name is Rick.

51:40.131 --> 51:42.698
I'm Anna.

51:57.113 --> 51:59.348
I've considered

51:59.350 --> 52:02.951
the high building option.

52:06.389 --> 52:09.892
But life is so absurdly
short, anyway.

52:13.630 --> 52:15.831
Yeah, I've been thinking that.

52:17.500 --> 52:20.836
Makes you only want to do
the important things.

52:22.806 --> 52:24.973
But what are the important things?

52:40.056 --> 52:42.758
I'm pregnant.

52:47.163 --> 52:49.531
First time I've told anybody.

52:58.541 --> 53:02.978
- Greyhound.
- You got it.

53:02.980 --> 53:05.981
Vodka and grapefruit.

53:12.989 --> 53:15.157
Here you go.

53:15.159 --> 53:18.327
Thank you.

53:18.329 --> 53:20.329
You don't know what a Greyhound is?

53:20.331 --> 53:23.665
Hey, who got us this job?

53:23.667 --> 53:28.303
So, anyway, all I'm saying
is marriage is just

53:28.305 --> 53:31.607
all of these artificial
restrictions.

53:31.609 --> 53:33.742
It's like going on
some radical diet

53:33.744 --> 53:36.044
when you're not even fat.

53:36.046 --> 53:40.149
All I'm saying is, yes,

53:40.151 --> 53:42.618
agreed, congratulations

53:42.620 --> 53:45.687
Anna is hot. She's incredibly hot.

53:45.689 --> 53:48.290
And, granted, you're probably
not going to meet anybody

53:48.292 --> 53:50.192
who's that hot and whatever cool

53:50.194 --> 53:52.795
and interesting and wonderful.

53:52.797 --> 53:55.164
I don't know
what you're talking about.

53:55.166 --> 53:56.665
You're making a scene.

53:56.667 --> 53:58.167
Well, what is he looking at, then?

53:58.169 --> 53:59.668
Right now he's looking at you.

53:59.670 --> 54:01.870
Having dragged me across
the room and yelling at me

54:01.872 --> 54:05.140
- in front of all my coworkers...
- I'm not yelling at you.

54:05.142 --> 54:07.910
Can I get a vodka and tonic?

54:12.782 --> 54:15.684
Brilliant, that's exactly right.

54:15.686 --> 54:17.453
- Yeah.
- Fucking more alcohol

54:17.455 --> 54:19.588
because that's really
going to help.

54:22.392 --> 54:24.126
Thank you.

54:31.568 --> 54:34.069
See? He probably
thought he was marrying

54:34.071 --> 54:35.871
the most magical,
beautiful girl on earth.

54:37.874 --> 54:39.475
It's up to you, man.
I'm just saying

54:39.477 --> 54:40.476
you could be dealing
with that kind of shit

54:40.478 --> 54:41.810
for the rest of your life.

54:41.812 --> 54:44.279
Or I could spend the rest
of my life saying,

54:44.281 --> 54:47.483
"I met the one true love of my life

54:47.485 --> 54:49.952
when I was 22 years old
and I was too scared

54:49.954 --> 54:53.822
- to ask her to marry me."
- If she is the one true love of your life.

54:53.824 --> 54:57.259
I mean, there are
billions of people.

55:09.572 --> 55:12.474
No, she's...

55:12.476 --> 55:15.344
she's the one true love of my life.

55:15.346 --> 55:18.046
Okay.

55:19.449 --> 55:23.585
So you have the rest of your
life to ask her to marry you.

55:32.262 --> 55:33.962
Fuck.

55:47.844 --> 55:50.612
It happens every time.

55:50.614 --> 55:55.918
I get dressed up to come to a thing
like this, and it's a fucking disaster.

56:07.297 --> 56:09.264
Len,

56:11.334 --> 56:14.202
none of these people matter to me.

56:21.978 --> 56:27.349
None of these people mean
anything to me except you.

56:39.662 --> 56:42.931
Let's get out of here.

56:53.176 --> 56:55.644
Ah, fuck.

57:08.791 --> 57:11.893
Oh, God I need water.

57:11.895 --> 57:12.794
Water.

57:12.796 --> 57:15.197
Done.

57:22.572 --> 57:25.407
What's this?

57:25.409 --> 57:27.643
I got it at the museum.

57:29.747 --> 57:31.546
It's a trilobite.

57:31.548 --> 57:33.448
It's probably like
300 million years old.

57:33.450 --> 57:37.052
And now they just give them
away with a $50 membership.

57:38.789 --> 57:41.890
There used to be billions of 'em.

57:41.892 --> 57:45.060
They must have had a lot of sex.

57:46.796 --> 57:49.064
They couldn't help themselves.

57:57.173 --> 58:00.375
They were in love.

58:00.377 --> 58:02.411
Or it was just instinct.

58:03.947 --> 58:07.282
Same thing, I guess.

58:20.730 --> 58:23.198
I'd have babies with you.

58:25.868 --> 58:28.370
I mean, not right away, but...

58:33.543 --> 58:37.079
we should, you know?

58:44.321 --> 58:46.188
What?

58:47.423 --> 58:49.324
I never said never.

58:49.326 --> 58:53.729
I said, "Don't marry me if
you want to have children."

58:53.731 --> 58:56.431
But you would?

58:59.669 --> 59:01.903
I could.

59:06.676 --> 59:09.111
Yeah, I would.

59:14.484 --> 59:16.418
We should.

59:18.087 --> 59:21.289
- Right?
- Right.

59:25.962 --> 59:27.796
Think of how beautiful it would be.

59:27.798 --> 59:30.932
"It"? She. She.

59:35.104 --> 59:38.874
Okay. We will.

59:38.876 --> 59:40.742
You promise?

59:40.744 --> 59:43.345
Not right away.

59:44.847 --> 59:46.948
But someday.

59:48.618 --> 59:50.485
Promise.

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:27.189
Mia?!

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:39.434
There you go.

01:00:46.642 --> 01:00:49.144
It's okay.

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.693
Come here.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.061
So we need to...

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:07.864
I need you to get everything
out of the kitchen

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:10.665
that you can, okay? I need you to
just get everything that you can.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:15.871
Okay? I'm going to go upstairs
and get some blankets. Okay?

01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:17.672
Gonna bring it down
to the basement.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:21.309
Okay? Yeah?

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.347
Sure.

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.349
Okay.

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:33.221
The following message is transmitted at the
request of the United States government.

01:01:33.223 --> 01:01:36.391
This is not a test. All
residents of the United States

01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:38.727
are strongly encouraged
to establish...

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:40.295
Gonna need some more tape.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:44.232
We've gotta seal all the windows up
here, we've gotta seal the door.

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:51.740
Does creme soda count as water?

01:01:51.742 --> 01:01:53.408
What?

01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:57.846
- Come on, sweetheart.
- I'll just get that, okay?

01:01:57.848 --> 01:02:00.015
Let's get everything downstairs.

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:04.920
It's all diet food.

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:07.155
It's all fucking...

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:12.327
low carb crap.

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:14.129
All of it.

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:17.832
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:20.535
Hey, look...

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:23.772
I have a chocolate bar
in my pocket, okay?

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:27.208
With almonds, okay?

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.744
Go back downstairs.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:31.246
Okay?

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:34.516
Go back downstairs.

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:38.053
- Come on, sweetie.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.701
I got it.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.538
Do you need this tape?

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.606
- Nope.
- Okay.

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:03.478
Did you call Sarah?

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.613
Mm-hmm.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.725
You okay down there, sweetheart?

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:34.676
Ooh.

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.819
Andy, it's...

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.721
it's time to stop.

01:03:46.723 --> 01:03:49.057
I thought you didn't
want to talk anymore.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:56.364
I just don't want to sit here
watching you kill yourself.

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:01.403
We'll get there.

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:03.638
You see? If we can
just make it up there,

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.075
we're gonna find some more
canisters, I know it.

01:04:09.578 --> 01:04:13.681
Stop that, Esther.
Stop it, come on.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.384
Take your hand...

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:18.820
Take your hand off the wheel.

01:04:23.859 --> 01:04:26.327
I'm sorry.

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.897
I'm sorry, but look.

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:30.598
I've gotta...

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.201
we can't afford the energy it takes

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.737
to fight like this.

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:40.308
I wish... I wish you would put

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:44.179
more energy into finding solutions.

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:47.282
There are no solutions, honey.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:52.253
The news broadcasts
have stopped, and...

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:55.490
everybody that we love is dead.

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:04.165
Listen to me.

01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:12.173
Everyone I love is not dead.

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:16.044
The only person
on earth that I love

01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:20.415
is still alive.

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:24.486
Oh, you're such a charmer.

01:05:24.488 --> 01:05:28.256
You could charm the
knickers off of any girl.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:34.729
Well, there's no girls
left but my girl.

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:40.268
Okay.

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:45.173
Here we go.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:02.824
I can't stand how much
I miss you when I'm gone.

01:06:02.826 --> 01:06:04.859
I know.

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.932
Oh... so, I got a new book

01:06:10.934 --> 01:06:13.868
that I really want to read to you.

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:15.737
Okay.

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:18.072
Wait, I don't know
which one to read to you.

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:20.041
Wow, that song is really good.

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:23.478
Yeah, you know, I...
Let me just read you one.

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:27.982
What... you don't have to stop.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.185
I know, I know.

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:33.388
I mean, I just, I just...

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:35.390
I just wanted to
show you something.

01:06:35.392 --> 01:06:37.358
In the park. I want your opinion

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.061
on something that they're
building across the river.

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:42.664
Uh, what, before we go home?

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.133
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:50.205
It's just been bugging me.
I pass it every day on my run,

01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:52.507
you know.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.108
Right.

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:56.177
So do you want to look at it?

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:58.313
Uh, sure.

01:06:58.315 --> 01:07:01.216
You don't want to hear this?

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:05.420
No, no. Read it to
me, read it to me.

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:07.422
Ahem.

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:11.926
"At the red towers of
your native Sodom,

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:14.696
the square where once you sang,

01:07:16.398 --> 01:07:20.602
the spinning shed, at the empty
windows set into the house,

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:24.239
where sons and daughters
blessed your marriage bed.

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:28.543
A single glance, a
sudden dart of pain

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:33.548
stitching her eyes
before she made a sound.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:38.052
Her body flaked into
transparent salt.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:41.222
Her swift legs rooted
to the ground."

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.324
Right?

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:48.329
That's... that's incredible.

01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:51.799
- You're so distracted.
- No, I'm not. I liked it.

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:54.002
No, you have no idea
what I just read to you.

01:07:54.004 --> 01:07:56.137
Not no idea. Come on.

01:07:56.139 --> 01:07:59.474
Hey. "Dilute."

01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:02.043
"Dilute. Dilute!"

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:06.748
Dilute. Okay.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:11.386
Come on. Let's go see
your weird-ass building.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:33.975
Okay. Uh...

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:37.145
this looks right.

01:08:37.147 --> 01:08:39.846
See that...

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:43.751
that big red building with
the arches? It's that.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:46.487
- Oh.
- Right next to it with the...

01:08:46.488 --> 01:08:48.756
The water tower, just
right under that,

01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:50.758
there's like this cluster
of red buildings.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.461
That red garage-looking thing?

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:57.265
- Yeah.
- I can't really see it.

01:08:57.267 --> 01:08:59.466
- Is it next to the...
- Yeah.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.803
What am I looking at?

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:07.575
Hey!

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:11.412
I have to give this to you now.

01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:15.750
Oh, my God.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:21.756
What does that mean?
What does that...

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:23.424
is that a "yes"?

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:28.796
You have to say yes
if you're gonna...

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.015
You still need to say "yes."

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:54.789
I love you.

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:59.827
I love you so much.

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:05.099
Say yes. You need to say yes.

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:10.238
Please.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.473
Look at you.

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:18.446
You love me...

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:29.090
Well, what do you
think of our news?

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:32.160
- What news?
- Our news.

01:10:32.162 --> 01:10:34.061
Erik and Anna.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.631
Oh, that's fine.

01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:39.333
Oh, honey. You don't
dislike Anna, do you?

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:42.270
I think she's wonderful
and I just love her.

01:10:42.272 --> 01:10:44.272
I'm just so happy about this.

01:10:44.274 --> 01:10:47.909
I like her fine.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:54.782
You know I offered him some
money and he wouldn't take it?

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:57.952
Oh, well, he's getting married.

01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:00.221
You know, he's going to
be the big macho man now.

01:11:00.223 --> 01:11:03.891
Head of the family. He'll probably
never take money from us again.

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:07.595
Well, I bet if I made it in real estate
or cattle ranching, he'd take it.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:10.064
What are you laughing at?

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:12.667
Nothing... well, yes, I am.

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:17.038
I'm thinking of you standing in
the middle of a herd of cows.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.106
Very funny.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:23.044
Honey, don't do that.

01:11:23.046 --> 01:11:26.347
Oh! Oh, shit.

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:29.250
God damn it.

01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:31.486
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:34.088
Just leave it. I'll get it later.

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:40.995
Come on over here, my darling
man, and talk to me.

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:54.041
What's the matter?

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:57.078
Tell me what's really
troubling you.

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:02.316
I took their money.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:05.853
They wouldn't have paid me so much if
they weren't gonna use my knowledge.

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:09.090
Oh, no. You weren't
working for them.

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:12.226
You were just working
at their laboratory.

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:16.163
They wanted great scientists
to work at their laboratory.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:18.132
It gives them prestige.

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:20.701
I knew they were
working on pathogens.

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:25.907
They were just picking my brain.
All I could think about was Liza.

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:30.945
Listen.

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:33.748
That money...

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:37.018
gave Liza 15 more years of life.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.955
It gave her Erik.

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:46.360
What if they use it, Esther?

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:50.665
What if they use it
and everybody dies?

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:53.634
Well, I think you're
going completely crazy.

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:55.102
I really do, you know.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:58.839
You are not to blame for
everything in this world,

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:02.109
no matter how smart you are.

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:04.712
And I'll tell you something else.

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.948
I'm taking a little
offense at this.

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:10.184
I didn't marry a murderer.

01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:13.955
I married the kindest,

01:13:13.957 --> 01:13:15.990
gentlest,

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:18.993
most loving man

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:21.696
in the world.

01:13:24.499 --> 01:13:30.371
I don't think you ever knew
just how much I love you.

01:13:41.249 --> 01:13:43.784
I swear, it...

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.821
- Esther?
- Ow...!

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:48.889
- What is it, honey?
- Ow!

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:52.126
- Come on, Esther. Come on. Come.
- Oh. No.

01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:55.463
- Come on, come with me.
- I'm fine. I just got excited.

01:13:55.465 --> 01:13:57.031
Come on, come on. Let me take you.

01:13:57.033 --> 01:13:59.834
I'll take you upstairs.
Okay, come on.

01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:01.702
One, two, three.

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:04.372
- Here we go.
- Oh...!

01:14:04.374 --> 01:14:07.241
Come on.

01:14:09.277 --> 01:14:11.846
Come on.

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.987
I'm okay, really.

01:14:22.290 --> 01:14:25.326
Well, whatever it is,
seven or eight days.

01:14:26.828 --> 01:14:28.629
When we're done with the water...

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:31.999
and there's tangerine juice, too.

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:38.172
When we're done with
everything, then we go up.

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:41.108
Even though the radio
said eight days.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:45.012
Maybe we ought to make it seven. But
what the fuck do they know, you know?

01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:49.150
Air could be clear at six. Clear
enough, anyway, for me to go up

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:52.053
and get supplies and
come back down here.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:05.900
- What?
- The last thing they said was...

01:15:05.902 --> 01:15:09.437
"200 million dead in Europe."

01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:15.810
So that's not everybody.

01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:18.713
Nothing's gonna be left, Len.

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:23.584
We don't know that until we see.

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:27.121
Len, nothing's left.

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:33.060
The radio stopped.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:38.199
There's no more planes
or helicopters.

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:42.336
When's the last time you heard
anything other than birds?

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:52.847
We'll stay down here
three more days.

01:15:52.849 --> 01:15:55.149
And then...

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:57.118
- We'll drive to the marina.
- No.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.121
We'll get a boat.

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:04.325
We'll go out on the lake.

01:16:04.327 --> 01:16:07.328
And we'll keep going
until we find someone.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.502
- I don't...
- What?

01:16:14.504 --> 01:16:16.670
I don't wanna...

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:20.241
wade through a bunch of corpses

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:22.977
to go steal a boat

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:26.147
to go look at more corpses
lying on a bunch of docks.

01:16:31.319 --> 01:16:34.021
Even...

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:37.725
even if we did make it, Len,

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:40.795
what are we supposed to do?

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:45.499
Do you really want
to play "Adam and Eve"?

01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:48.636
Build it all back up so it all
just gets destroyed again?

01:16:48.638 --> 01:16:50.805
Maybe people will learn.

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:56.177
It's like that guy who hit you for
trying to take care of his kid.

01:16:56.179 --> 01:16:59.046
It's like that guy
I defended... great guy,

01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:02.883
good father, always showing me
pictures of his grandson...

01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:06.487
who helped invent the shit
that killed everyone.

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:12.593
People aren't going to learn.

01:17:12.595 --> 01:17:14.762
It's something in us.

01:17:14.764 --> 01:17:17.598
It's something in the
way that we're made.

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:23.470
Then at least...

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:26.907
we'll have more time.

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:29.476
At least we'll go out
on the water together.

01:17:34.015 --> 01:17:37.184
We'll find a boat with
a nice, big cabin.

01:17:42.123 --> 01:17:44.325
Come on.

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:54.301
Len?

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:56.971
That guy, Jay, from the law firm?

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:10.417
He fell in love with me.

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:18.559
I never did anything.

01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:21.061
I never let him touch me.

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:25.366
But I...

01:18:26.801 --> 01:18:29.370
you know, I...

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:36.110
I made him think, I guess...

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:41.682
that he had a shot at it.

01:18:42.918 --> 01:18:45.619
- Why?
- It was just a way to...

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:48.923
Just a way to pass the time?

01:18:48.925 --> 01:18:52.092
To feel better
about myself, I guess.

01:19:02.203 --> 01:19:05.739
Why do you need to feel
better about yourself?

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:08.609
It wasn't about you.

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:29.263
It was just my curse.

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.905
Len.

01:19:37.907 --> 01:19:43.143
Why are they gonna stay down
here like caged animals?

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:53.120
Or we're gonna go
upstairs tomorrow...

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:02.029
and lie down on the grass.

01:20:03.832 --> 01:20:06.000
Breathe in...

01:20:07.902 --> 01:20:10.170
and die...

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:12.673
when and where we choose.

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:20.547
We'll eat the chocolate bar
before we do it, okay?

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:25.686
Okay?

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:52.746
- Oh, my God.
- What? What?

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:56.550
Did you buy this weird soap?

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:59.386
What?

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:02.122
I seriously think
I've found my new religion.

01:21:05.927 --> 01:21:07.394
Oh, yeah, that stuff.

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:09.696
Wait, have you read this?

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.899
No. I mean, the
writing's so tiny...

01:21:11.901 --> 01:21:14.635
Wait a minute. Listen to this.

01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:16.970
"Einstein, 1939.

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:21.909
After Nazis and Commies united,
proposes 'space bombs'

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:28.048
that destroys all unless we
finally teach the moral ABCs

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:31.618
the real Rabbi Hillel taught Jesus

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:36.323
to unite all in,
all one, God faith."

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:05.085
Did you find a pay phone?

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:13.060
I got some noodles.

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:15.062
Just gotta add water.

01:22:15.064 --> 01:22:17.431
And some drinks.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:20.934
And there's these things...

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.103
energy bars.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:27.174
And napkins.

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:33.947
I couldn't find a pay phone. I don't
think they make them anymore.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:37.651
What is this doing on a soap bottle?
And where did you get this?

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:39.353
I mean, it was at
the health food store.

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:41.922
- It was cheap.
- "We're all one or none.

01:22:41.924 --> 01:22:46.026
There is no god but God.
Teach 'Love thy enemy.'

01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:49.263
One Israel-Moses-
Buddha-Jesus-Mohammed.

01:22:49.265 --> 01:22:51.632
- One! All one!"
- All one!

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:54.334
"Dilute! Dilute! Okay!"

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:56.470
How about the switchboard?

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:59.306
The hospital switchboard.

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:04.077
Or all of these houses and
apartments around here.

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:06.880
They've all got to have phones.

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:11.818
Esther...

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.755
he's gone.

01:23:14.757 --> 01:23:18.325
Erik's gone.

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:19.660
Oh, look at this. Read this.

01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:21.261
"For on God's spaceship, Earth"...

01:23:21.263 --> 01:23:23.830
"With bomb and gun,

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:26.333
we're all one or none.

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:29.603
All one, all one, all one!

01:23:29.605 --> 01:23:33.073
Exceptions eternally?
Absolutely none!"

01:23:33.075 --> 01:23:36.076
"Absolutely none."

01:23:36.078 --> 01:23:37.878
Oh, my God.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.214
Why is the most inspiring
thing that I've ever read

01:23:40.216 --> 01:23:43.016
sitting on a soap bottle?

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:44.518
"Dilute."

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.753
"Dilute! Dilute!"

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.989
"Dilute! Okay."

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:05.505
- You don't know that.
- It's just the way it is.

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:09.543
Because he could be
with any of his friends.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.712
That's just it, honey.

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:14.982
You don't know it
for sure. You don't...

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:21.054
No! No!

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:25.292
Oh, oop!

01:24:25.294 --> 01:24:27.396
No...

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:42.776
Oh, God, no.

01:24:42.778 --> 01:24:44.645
Shh...

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:40.000
Okay, people. We're closing
down shop in two minutes.

01:25:40.002 --> 01:25:43.036
You've got two minutes to get
your purchases up to the counter.

01:25:43.038 --> 01:25:45.605
Okay?

01:25:45.607 --> 01:25:48.809
That's it, man.
We gotta go. Come on.

01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:51.478
250. Let's go.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.347
- Come on.
- Yeah.

01:25:53.349 --> 01:25:55.515
Um... fuck.

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:57.117
- Hey. We're done, man.
- Let's go.

01:25:57.119 --> 01:25:59.920
I-I gave all my money to...
here, just run this.

01:25:59.922 --> 01:26:01.888
Yeah, okay, buddy.
That's it. We're outta here.

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:04.791
You're closing up shop.
Just... just...

01:26:04.793 --> 01:26:06.927
you're not selling any more
of these anyway, right?

01:26:06.929 --> 01:26:08.695
Don't be stupid, man. We ain't
giving them away, either.

01:26:08.697 --> 01:26:12.566
I understand that. Just take this.
Here. That's all I got. It's all I got.

01:26:12.568 --> 01:26:16.203
Get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out now.

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:25.078
- Hey.
- Hey! Put down the kit!

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.981
It's the end of the world, okay? Just
let me walk out of here with a chance.

01:26:27.983 --> 01:26:29.950
Put down the kit.

01:26:29.952 --> 01:26:34.821
What? The last thing you wanna
do on earth is shoot me?

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:38.024
This is how this shit
started, anyway.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.960
Right? That's how it
started in the first...

01:26:50.671 --> 01:26:53.807
- You ready?
- I'm fine.

01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:57.144
Good. If you're fine,
the tests are gonna show it.

01:26:57.146 --> 01:26:59.846
Anyway...

01:26:59.848 --> 01:27:03.283
we haven't seen Dr.
Henderson for a long time.

01:27:03.285 --> 01:27:05.218
- Come here.
- That's right.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.987
And here I was,
trying to cheer you up.

01:27:06.989 --> 01:27:09.122
Oh, yeah.

01:27:11.526 --> 01:27:13.760
You remember when
we lived in Washington,

01:27:13.762 --> 01:27:15.996
the Georgetown apartment?

01:27:15.998 --> 01:27:17.831
Yes, I do.

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:19.666
We both got the flu
at the same time.

01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:23.870
Yeah. And I took care of you first.

01:27:23.872 --> 01:27:25.772
I ran out in the freezing cold,

01:27:25.774 --> 01:27:28.341
went and got you a nice,
big bowl of hot soup.

01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:30.944
- It was so cold.
- Yeah.

01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:35.215
And I wrapped you up all
nice and cozy in a blanket.

01:27:35.217 --> 01:27:36.883
Remember?

01:27:36.885 --> 01:27:40.053
Then I turned the thermostat
up as high as it would go.

01:27:40.055 --> 01:27:43.089
Then it was my turn to baby you.

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.459
Tucked you in real tight,

01:27:45.461 --> 01:27:50.797
And I made you some of those
awful poached eggs you like.

01:27:50.799 --> 01:27:52.766
Mm-hmm.

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:59.005
It's been a good life.

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:01.475
Yeah, I think so.

01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:05.812
A good life.

01:28:12.187 --> 01:28:14.955
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

01:28:14.957 --> 01:28:17.357
What?

01:28:17.359 --> 01:28:19.793
The best thing in the world.

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:19.286
I have something to tell you.

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:24.558
What...?

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.761
The best thing in the world.

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:36.036
We're going to have a baby.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:02.228
We don't have to do this.

01:30:06.133 --> 01:30:11.171
Whatever we said last night,
we don't have to do it.

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:17.243
Not today, anyway.

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:24.184
Mmm, mmm.

01:30:24.186 --> 01:30:26.252
I regret every fucking
diet I ever went on.

01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:33.960
Mmm.

01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:03.289
Come on.

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:08.294
Let's get out of here.

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:22.876
Ahem.

01:31:27.182 --> 01:31:31.751
If you have to, if that's
what you have to do...

01:31:31.753 --> 01:31:34.788
go, but I won't.

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:39.359
I...

01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:43.997
I don't think we're gonna run out of food.
I don't think we're gonna run out of water.

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:46.399
I think that if we just stay down
here another couple of days...

01:31:46.401 --> 01:31:48.601
- No.
- If we go up then, we're gonna be fine.

01:31:48.603 --> 01:31:50.270
- Mm-mm.
- Okay?

01:31:50.272 --> 01:31:52.672
- No.
- Yeah.

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:55.008
Yes!

01:32:01.982 --> 01:32:04.084
Yes.

01:32:10.759 --> 01:32:14.027
Mia! Don't leave me!

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:20.633
Don't leave me. Stay with me.

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:23.570
I love you, baby,
I love you. I need you.

01:32:23.572 --> 01:32:26.306
I need you, I need you.
I need you, I need you... stay!

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:33.313
Please stay!

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:39.018
Please, I need you. Please?
