WEBVTT

01:09.505 --> 01:10.338
Hey!

01:12.422 --> 01:13.755
What happened to him?

01:23.880 --> 01:26.880
Where did you get that?
What are you doing here?

01:30.255 --> 01:31.630
I just want to go home.

01:33.338 --> 01:34.880
Maybe he's a returned POW.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.463
Looks like you've been roughed up.

01:48.088 --> 01:50.422
I guess you could use something to eat.

01:50.505 --> 01:51.838
I'm fine, thanks.

01:51.922 --> 01:54.422
Nonsense.
Erna has a soft spot for fellas like you.

01:54.505 --> 01:55.838
Come along.

03:00.838 --> 03:03.380
Agnes, go and let Erna know.

03:04.380 --> 03:05.297
Run.

03:15.005 --> 03:16.297
Where were you stationed?

03:23.963 --> 03:25.047
Eastern front.

03:27.213 --> 03:29.463
-Labor camp.
-Those people aren't human.

03:29.922 --> 03:31.755
We should have won the war.

03:36.797 --> 03:38.547
Do you have a place to sleep?

03:46.213 --> 03:48.463
Tell your brother
to get the chamber ready.

03:49.047 --> 03:50.630
But just for a few days.

03:51.380 --> 03:52.963
Until you're back on your feet.

03:54.005 --> 03:55.713
I know this sounds strange.

03:58.588 --> 03:59.963
But what year is it?

04:03.672 --> 04:05.838
They did quite a job on you, didn't they?

04:08.838 --> 04:10.130
1921.

04:17.797 --> 04:19.213
1921...

05:51.172 --> 05:53.338
JUNE 24, 2020

05:53.422 --> 05:56.838
THREE DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

06:29.588 --> 06:31.463
I think we're a perfect match.

06:33.797 --> 06:35.547
Never believe anything else.

07:10.088 --> 07:10.922
Yes?

07:11.505 --> 07:13.713
Mrs. Doppler called in. She's sick.

07:14.255 --> 07:15.630
What's wrong with her?

07:17.088 --> 07:18.130
She didn't say.

07:19.213 --> 07:20.088
Hold on.

07:23.213 --> 07:26.172
-You're Mr. Wöller, right?
-Yes.

07:29.005 --> 07:30.505
Then the pleasure is ours today.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.005
-You do have a car, right?
-Mm-hmm.

07:38.630 --> 07:39.463
Wonderful.

08:29.297 --> 08:32.630
CALL FROM
HANNAH KAHNWALD

09:30.630 --> 09:32.047
Where did you get this?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.297
-Who is this?
-It's complicated.

09:45.172 --> 09:46.713
Mom, why do you have that?

09:50.005 --> 09:51.630
Should I make us breakfast?

10:06.588 --> 10:08.255
What are we going to do with Mom?

10:09.755 --> 10:10.797
I don't know.

10:27.297 --> 10:28.588
What do you want?

10:32.297 --> 10:33.880
-Martha.
-Franziska.

10:33.963 --> 10:36.047
-What do you want?
-We have to talk.

10:42.005 --> 10:45.713
-What?
-If you expect an apology, forget it!

10:45.797 --> 10:47.005
You fucked up.

10:47.463 --> 10:50.380
But I shouldn't have said what I said.
We're even.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.422
Am I supposed to babysit
while you make out?

10:55.713 --> 10:57.338
Why did you bring her along?

10:57.672 --> 11:00.047
My parents haven't been home in two days.

11:00.755 --> 11:02.213
I can't leave her alone.

11:05.380 --> 11:07.338
Why is everyone acting so weird?

11:19.963 --> 11:23.588
-I want to know what's up.
-What? You want to go into the caves?

11:24.880 --> 11:26.088
You can stay here.

11:44.630 --> 11:46.463
You slept nearly 24 hours.

11:53.297 --> 11:54.130
Who are you?

11:58.047 --> 12:01.338
People say Erna can't say no
to any stray dogs.

12:07.505 --> 12:08.880
I'm in the wrong place.

12:11.713 --> 12:12.963
This isn't right.

12:20.797 --> 12:22.422
I pictured you differently.

12:30.172 --> 12:31.713
Why did you just say that?

12:33.172 --> 12:34.255
What does it mean?

13:13.505 --> 13:15.838
<i>Sic mundus creatus est.</i>

14:22.672 --> 14:23.672
Can I help you?

14:26.047 --> 14:27.922
I'm looking for someone.

14:29.297 --> 14:31.838
She used to work here.
It was a while back.

14:32.463 --> 14:34.463
Tiedemann. Claudia Tiedemann.

14:36.422 --> 14:37.755
She used to run the plant.

14:37.838 --> 14:41.172
-Where can I find her?
-There's only one Tiedemann here.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.463
Aleksander Tiedemann.
He runs the plant.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.505
Aleksander Tiedemann?

14:48.963 --> 14:52.755
So that's why you didn't want to let
Ulrich Nielsen onto the grounds?

14:53.588 --> 14:55.838
After Fukushima
safety standards were raised.

14:57.380 --> 14:59.630
I can't just let anyone stroll in here.

15:01.255 --> 15:05.672
His suspicion that his son might be
on the grounds was totally unfounded.

15:06.922 --> 15:08.880
You know about the door in the cave?

15:10.922 --> 15:12.797
It was installed in the 1980s.

15:12.880 --> 15:16.463
It was already welded shut back then,
as a security measure.

15:16.547 --> 15:19.880
-It's still sealed shut.
-You know what I find strange?

15:21.922 --> 15:24.505
Everyone who was born here stays.

15:26.255 --> 15:28.463
Seems odd, in a town of this size.

15:31.047 --> 15:32.130
What do you think?

15:33.505 --> 15:34.630
Why is that?

15:36.380 --> 15:40.630
The nuclear power plant always took care 
of people. There's work.

15:41.713 --> 15:43.297
Prosperity, security.

15:48.797 --> 15:50.463
That'll probably change now.

15:52.338 --> 15:53.547
When the plant closes.

15:57.255 --> 15:59.505
-You're not from here.
-No.

16:00.463 --> 16:01.297
Why?

16:02.963 --> 16:05.005
You came to Winden in 1986.

16:08.255 --> 16:10.463
At the same time the boy disappeared.

16:10.963 --> 16:11.797
Mads Nielsen.

16:13.297 --> 16:14.797
Ulrich Nielsen's brother.

16:15.463 --> 16:17.213
No. It was a bit later.

16:18.505 --> 16:19.422
A few weeks.

16:22.172 --> 16:23.547
Why does that matter?

16:33.297 --> 16:34.797
It probably doesn't.

16:51.463 --> 16:52.797
Just one more question.

16:53.797 --> 16:55.963
Why did you take your wife's name?

16:58.088 --> 16:59.213
I don't understand.

17:00.463 --> 17:02.713
Pretty unusual for the time.

17:05.797 --> 17:09.505
The Tiedemanns shaped this town.
Especially Regina's mother.

17:11.088 --> 17:15.047
Regina has no siblings.
We wanted to keep the name alive.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.880
What's your real name?

17:20.838 --> 17:23.547
Köhler. Aleksander Köhler.

17:34.630 --> 17:36.255
Who's next on the list?

17:38.630 --> 17:40.088
Mr. Wöller?

17:46.505 --> 17:47.922
Hannah Kahnwald.

18:01.630 --> 18:04.547
<i>Why do you have a gun</i>
<i>and someone else's passport?</i>

18:07.213 --> 18:08.338
It's insurance.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.755
What do you mean?

18:13.880 --> 18:16.672
Someone needs
to keep both things hidden.

18:20.713 --> 18:22.297
You're blackmailing someone?

18:23.963 --> 18:25.130
Who are you?

18:28.963 --> 18:29.797
Who I am?

18:34.005 --> 18:34.880
Who are you?

18:38.880 --> 18:39.713
Hannah?

18:51.505 --> 18:52.422
I'm sorry.

18:53.338 --> 18:55.130
But we have to tell someone.

18:59.505 --> 19:03.797
Thanks for getting here so soon.
I know none of this makes sense, but...

19:04.922 --> 19:06.713
This is Jonas. He...

19:07.297 --> 19:10.172
He's much older,
and he knows where my Jonas is,

19:10.255 --> 19:11.547
and where Ulrich is.

19:21.880 --> 19:25.172
You're the man from the hotel
Regina talked about.

19:28.672 --> 19:29.922
Who are these people?

19:38.422 --> 19:40.255
This man here. The priest.

19:41.338 --> 19:42.880
Do you know who he is?

19:43.672 --> 19:44.713
That's Noah.

19:46.547 --> 19:47.713
You know him?

19:50.297 --> 19:51.797
What do you know about him?

19:54.880 --> 19:57.005
-He's one of them.
-What is all this?

19:57.505 --> 19:58.338
One of whom?

20:02.172 --> 20:03.213
Sic Mundus.

20:04.463 --> 20:05.422
The travelers.

20:06.672 --> 20:07.672
The travelers?

20:09.255 --> 20:10.963
<i>Sic mundus creatus est</i>?

20:12.338 --> 20:15.172
What are you talking about?
You knew all of this?

20:15.797 --> 20:17.755
The time travel?

20:18.797 --> 20:21.005
There's something you should both see.

20:37.672 --> 20:38.672
Okay.

20:47.505 --> 20:49.422
You want to go in there?

20:51.255 --> 20:55.797
After four kids disappeared here?

21:07.213 --> 21:10.713
You stay with me.
Do what I tell you. Okay?

21:27.463 --> 21:31.713
WINDEN MUNICIPAL LIBRARY

21:44.463 --> 21:45.422
Excuse me.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.130
I am interested in...

21:48.380 --> 21:49.630
the town's history.

21:50.922 --> 21:54.797
Where can I find articles and publications
from the past 30 years?

21:55.130 --> 21:56.547
It's all been digitized.

22:02.713 --> 22:04.255
And where do I find that?

23:02.172 --> 23:03.088
Excuse me.

23:04.672 --> 23:06.130
Where's the keyboard?

23:07.547 --> 23:08.588
There isn't one.

23:19.505 --> 23:20.672
SEARCH

23:28.338 --> 23:29.172
CLAUDIA TIEDEMANN

23:31.088 --> 23:34.088
CLAUDIA TIEDEMANN FIRST WOMAN
TO HEAD A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

23:42.005 --> 23:45.630
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BOSS
DISAPPEARS WITHOUT A TRACE

23:52.755 --> 23:54.547
You informed her about the meeting?

23:56.172 --> 23:57.005
Yes.

23:58.588 --> 24:00.047
APPOINTMENTS

24:00.130 --> 24:01.838
Anything about Hannah Kahnwald?

24:08.172 --> 24:10.172
Her husband killed himself last year.

24:11.297 --> 24:12.880
He hanged himself.

24:13.797 --> 24:17.713
Actually, no one here understood
why she married him. She's very pretty.

24:18.422 --> 24:20.505
She could've had any man she wanted.

24:20.588 --> 24:23.422
It was rumored she had an affair
with Ulrich Nielsen.

24:26.047 --> 24:27.880
Did Mrs. Nielsen know about it?

24:42.880 --> 24:44.172
May I ask you something?

24:45.755 --> 24:47.005
Go ahead.

24:49.422 --> 24:51.088
How did you get this position?

24:52.755 --> 24:54.047
Special task force.

24:54.797 --> 24:56.338
Did you volunteer for it?

25:01.880 --> 25:02.713
Oh, yes.

25:04.838 --> 25:05.672
I did.

25:26.880 --> 25:30.797
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

25:37.338 --> 25:39.630
She told Tronte and me what to do.

25:43.047 --> 25:44.130
Claudia Tiedemann.

25:45.005 --> 25:47.838
She knew the exact time
things would happen.

25:49.213 --> 25:53.005
It made no sense. And yet 
it was the only thing that made sense.

25:54.547 --> 25:55.755
You knew all this?

25:59.047 --> 25:59.922
Michael?

26:00.338 --> 26:01.547
Mikkel? Ulrich?

26:04.088 --> 26:05.047
You knew it all?

26:12.797 --> 26:13.630
This here.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.963
She gave it to us.

26:17.005 --> 26:19.380
It's all in there. About the children...

26:19.838 --> 26:21.130
Who disappeared when.

26:22.088 --> 26:23.588
Things about time travel.

26:24.630 --> 26:27.005
Symbols and tables
we don't really understand.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.505
The last few pages were ripped out.

26:32.172 --> 26:34.130
Does Katharina know about this?

26:38.172 --> 26:39.505
You have to tell her.

26:47.922 --> 26:48.755
Okay.

26:52.505 --> 26:53.588
But I'll do it.

26:59.797 --> 27:01.588
REGINA AND ALEKSANDER TIEDEMANN
TO WED

27:04.422 --> 27:07.588
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
REGINA TIEDEMANN - ALEKSANDER TIEDEMANN

27:11.463 --> 27:14.755
WALDHOTEL WINDEN OPENS

27:16.922 --> 27:20.047
WALDHOTEL WINDEN CLOSED

27:24.880 --> 27:27.005
EGON TIEDEMANN

27:31.130 --> 27:35.130
NO TRACE OF MADS NIELSEN
CHIEF INSPECTOR EGON TIEDEMANN...

27:40.672 --> 27:43.630
FORMER WINDEN CHIEF INSPECTOR
FOUND DEAD IN HIS APARTMENT

27:43.713 --> 27:44.838
ON JUNE, 26 1987

27:57.338 --> 27:58.213
Excuse me.

27:59.463 --> 28:01.213
Can you print from these things?

28:47.172 --> 28:48.922
<i>Sometimes I dream about him.</i>

28:52.380 --> 28:53.213
Jonas.

28:57.213 --> 28:58.922
It feels so real.

29:00.797 --> 29:02.255
As if he were still alive.

29:04.130 --> 29:06.755
How can it feel so real if he's dead?

29:09.547 --> 29:12.713
Do you think he knew something?
Before he disappeared?

29:14.588 --> 29:15.672
What do you mean?

29:17.838 --> 29:20.838
That he found out something
he wasn't supposed to.

29:22.255 --> 29:24.005
The door has to be here.

29:54.130 --> 29:55.880
Where are we going, Charlotte?

30:01.172 --> 30:02.838
Tell me where we're going.

30:05.047 --> 30:07.422
Damn it, Charlotte! Where are we going?

30:07.505 --> 30:10.338
It's easier to explain it
if I show it to you.

30:15.255 --> 30:16.838
Have you found them?

30:22.463 --> 30:23.630
You found them.

30:28.422 --> 30:31.005
We found them. Both of them.

30:33.130 --> 30:35.422
They're not dead. They're alive.

30:40.672 --> 30:41.922
But they're not here.

30:45.255 --> 30:46.463
What does that mean?

30:48.088 --> 30:50.047
They're alive, they're not here?

30:51.797 --> 30:54.047
You better see it with your own eyes.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.672
What's she doing here?

31:23.963 --> 31:25.422
What is this, Charlotte?

31:26.255 --> 31:29.880
You said you thought Mikkel
was in the cave. You were right.

31:29.963 --> 31:33.380
Mikkel was in the cave,
and Ulrich was looking for him there.

31:38.380 --> 31:40.422
But there was something in the caves.

31:41.922 --> 31:43.130
A kind of

31:43.213 --> 31:45.380
crack in time.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.588
Are you screwing with me?

32:03.713 --> 32:05.505
What is all this bullshit?

32:07.422 --> 32:09.713
-Where are Mikkel and Ulrich?
-It's true...

32:09.797 --> 32:11.172
Shut your face!

32:11.797 --> 32:13.922
No one asked for your opinion.

32:16.755 --> 32:17.880
Charlotte is right.

32:21.797 --> 32:22.713
Another one.

32:25.505 --> 32:28.172
Who are you? Her new lover?

32:30.088 --> 32:31.088
I'm Jonas.

32:33.922 --> 32:34.755
Her son.

32:39.297 --> 32:40.213
Your grandson.

33:43.130 --> 33:44.463
She says it's shaking.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.963
-What is it?
-There's someone there.

33:54.838 --> 33:56.088
Go, go!

33:56.422 --> 33:57.755
Flashlights off!

34:18.922 --> 34:20.338
Bartosz?

34:28.213 --> 34:29.505
Why are you here?

34:31.172 --> 34:32.463
What the fuck?

34:34.338 --> 34:35.713
What are you doing here?

34:42.672 --> 34:46.380
<i>My husband is caught in the 1950s,</i>
<i>and my son in the 1980s?</i>

34:47.963 --> 34:51.047
You left him there
because Mikkel is your father. Right?

34:52.922 --> 34:53.755
Yes.

35:01.797 --> 35:03.130
I can't believe it.

35:03.422 --> 35:05.672
That you're buying all his bullshit.

35:07.338 --> 35:09.463
What do you want? Huh?

35:12.505 --> 35:13.380
Money?

35:14.297 --> 35:16.255
Can you talk to the dead? Hm?

35:19.088 --> 35:19.963
Katharina.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.463
I was there.

35:25.838 --> 35:26.797
I saw him.

35:28.963 --> 35:29.797
Mikkel.

35:42.380 --> 35:43.838
You've all lost it.

37:23.630 --> 37:24.463
No.

38:05.463 --> 38:08.547
If you have anything to do
with this shit...

38:09.005 --> 38:09.880
Fuck you!

38:10.547 --> 38:13.130
Stop it. Just tell us why you're here!

38:21.838 --> 38:22.838
Come here.

38:33.630 --> 38:34.463
What is that?

38:38.005 --> 38:38.838
What is it?

38:39.255 --> 38:41.255
Hands off. It's not your business.

38:44.713 --> 38:47.380
If you have anything to do
with Mikkel or Dad...

38:49.213 --> 38:50.297
I'll kill you.

38:55.047 --> 38:56.672
What are we going to do now?

38:58.505 --> 38:59.672
We're taking it.

39:01.338 --> 39:02.255
And him?

39:04.130 --> 39:05.422
We'll leave him here.

39:06.505 --> 39:08.172
Maybe he'll change his mind.

39:10.422 --> 39:11.255
Shit!

39:12.463 --> 39:13.547
You can't do that.

39:16.088 --> 39:16.922
Martha!

39:17.630 --> 39:18.547
You can't do that!

39:20.922 --> 39:22.588
Hey. Fuck... Hey!

39:23.713 --> 39:24.588
Magnus!

39:24.963 --> 39:26.588
Hey! Magnus!

39:28.213 --> 39:29.130
Magnus!

39:36.672 --> 39:38.547
<i>What's your take on all of this?</i>

39:39.255 --> 39:40.922
We have a man-eating cave.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.838
An NPP with a boss
who is obviously hiding something.

39:46.505 --> 39:48.755
An inspector who has gone into hiding.

39:49.172 --> 39:51.047
And a town full of people

39:51.130 --> 39:53.505
who lie, cheat and betray one another.

39:55.422 --> 39:59.380
And who are all only concerned with
concealing what's really going on here.

40:01.838 --> 40:02.755
So, Mr. Wöller?

40:04.713 --> 40:06.130
What do you make of it?

40:11.255 --> 40:12.588
I don't know.

40:19.297 --> 40:20.838
What happened to your eye?

40:30.380 --> 40:31.213
Okay.

40:33.963 --> 40:34.797
But...

40:36.172 --> 40:37.713
you can't tell anyone.

40:42.130 --> 40:43.130
Well...

40:44.505 --> 40:46.088
-Last summer...
-Watch out!

41:05.880 --> 41:06.963
Interesting.

41:25.213 --> 41:27.505
TEACHER'S LOUNGE
PLEASE KNOCK

41:39.130 --> 41:40.547
1986, 1986...

41:48.797 --> 41:51.880
KAHNWALD, MICHAEL - 6B

41:51.963 --> 41:53.213
6b.

41:53.880 --> 41:55.630
6b...

41:57.130 --> 41:58.297
6b.

41:59.588 --> 42:01.547
CLASS REGISTER

42:39.463 --> 42:40.547
It's not open yet.

42:56.713 --> 43:00.047
It's going to take
nearly 32 more years until it opens.

43:01.422 --> 43:02.672
So you know about it?

43:10.088 --> 43:11.672
They're waiting for you.

43:17.797 --> 43:18.630
Who?

43:19.755 --> 43:20.797
Sic Mundus.

43:23.047 --> 43:26.630
You want to go home, right? 
That's what they say, anyway.

43:27.880 --> 43:28.797
Who are "they"?

43:33.172 --> 43:34.172
The travelers.

43:52.838 --> 43:53.672
And now?

43:58.380 --> 43:59.505
It doesn't matter.

44:01.297 --> 44:03.547
Everything will happen as it always has.

44:06.797 --> 44:08.422
Then why are you here?

44:12.130 --> 44:14.630
-He said there's a loophole.
-Who?

44:15.797 --> 44:16.630
Adam.

44:16.963 --> 44:17.963
Who's Adam?

44:19.505 --> 44:21.005
The leader of Sic Mundus.

44:21.422 --> 44:22.838
The people in the photo,

44:23.422 --> 44:24.463
the travelers?

44:25.047 --> 44:25.880
Yes.

44:27.838 --> 44:29.838
He wants the last cycle to begin.

44:30.630 --> 44:31.588
In three days.

44:33.338 --> 44:34.463
I have to stop him.

44:40.213 --> 44:41.505
That's why I'm here.

44:47.088 --> 44:48.130
She tried.

44:53.588 --> 44:56.088
But in the end she became
what she wanted to fight.

46:41.505 --> 46:43.338
What are we doing here?

46:47.130 --> 46:48.297
You're one of them.

46:50.213 --> 46:51.088
A traveler.

46:52.755 --> 46:53.588
Not yet.

46:54.755 --> 46:55.880
But I will be soon.

47:21.172 --> 47:23.922
It must be strange for you to see me here.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.130
Especially after our last encounter.

47:31.755 --> 47:34.172
You've already made my acquaintance.

47:46.213 --> 47:48.588
You finally want answers, don't you?

49:17.922 --> 49:21.630
ALEKSANDER KÖHLER?

50:17.297 --> 50:20.880
<i>SIC MUNDUS CREATUS EST</i>

51:53.088 --> 51:55.547
What are you doing here?

51:57.297 --> 51:58.630
What is that in there?

52:01.380 --> 52:02.880
You knew it was here!

52:05.380 --> 52:06.380
You were

52:07.338 --> 52:09.047
lying to us the entire time.

52:10.172 --> 52:11.047
What is that?

52:12.922 --> 52:13.963
What is that?

52:17.047 --> 52:22.797
They say it's a piece of God.

52:27.338 --> 52:30.297
But it's really a piece of the devil.

52:42.130 --> 52:43.130
The prophecy.

52:45.630 --> 52:46.672
How did it arise?

53:03.297 --> 53:04.880
The book. Who wrote it?

53:17.255 --> 53:19.922
Whoever it was who wrote it...

53:21.880 --> 53:24.838
had already seen the future and the past.

53:36.588 --> 53:38.172
What will happen next?

53:43.838 --> 53:47.172
Adam will send him on the path
that has been predetermined for him.

53:49.755 --> 53:51.672
So the last cycle can begin.

54:44.880 --> 54:47.213
You must have a lot of questions.

55:12.130 --> 55:15.172
Traveling doesn't leave one unscathed.

55:17.422 --> 55:20.630
The human body isn't equipped for it
on a continual basis.

55:28.338 --> 55:29.463
What is this place?

55:35.963 --> 55:37.088
Shall we begin?

55:38.797 --> 55:43.255
I don't want to begin anything.
I want this to finally end. All of it!

55:44.422 --> 55:46.338
Don't worry. It will end.

55:47.338 --> 55:48.547
That is inevitable.

55:49.922 --> 55:50.755
Your end.

55:52.047 --> 55:52.880
My end.

55:55.547 --> 55:58.255
Upon closer examination, everyone's end.

56:09.380 --> 56:10.213
Who are you?

56:21.422 --> 56:23.172
Don't you know?

56:43.338 --> 56:44.338
That can't be.

56:46.672 --> 56:47.630
I am you.

56:52.588 --> 56:55.130
Every stone is once again
where it belongs.

56:56.255 --> 56:58.755
Everyone in the place
they were destined to be.

57:03.755 --> 57:05.838
Now all that's needed is a little push.

57:06.505 --> 57:08.755
