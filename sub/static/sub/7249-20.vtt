00:02.252 --> 00:03.754
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

00:03.836 --> 00:06.465
- What do you mean you had an accident?
- Jess swerved...

00:06.548 --> 00:08.425
Jess was driving and had an accident?

00:08.509 --> 00:11.094
If you hadn't brought him,
this wouldn't have happened!

00:11.178 --> 00:12.179
This is my fault?

00:12.262 --> 00:14.473
- Have you talked to Dean?
- He gets home tomorrow.

00:14.556 --> 00:15.891
- What'll you say?
- I don't know.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.936
Now I have to find Jess
and I have to make sure he's okay...

00:19.019 --> 00:22.397
and if that cuts into your screaming time,
that's just too bad!

00:22.481 --> 00:24.149
- Go to hell!
- Right back at you!

00:24.233 --> 00:26.693
I can't believe
Luke would send him off like that.

00:26.777 --> 00:28.487
I heard the kid wanted to go.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.990
I don't know.
All I know is that Jess is gone.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.576
Well, well, well.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.496
What will we do
for entertainment around here?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.540
Beats the hell out of me.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.298
- What?
- Nothing.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.675
- Are you tilting?
- No.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.510
- I think you're tilting.
- I'm not.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.804
Want to hold on to my purse?
It might even you out.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.348
Stop any time you like.
What are you doing?

00:56.390 --> 00:59.226
I'll put a pen on top of your head
and see if it rolls off.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.520
This is not how you console the injured.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.522
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.024
- What about this?
- The Little Locksmith.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.402
And I got it at the bookstore.
Paid full price.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.237
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Feel better?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.530
- I do.
- Good.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.575
- Now can I put a pen on top of your head?
- No.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.285
- Mom...
- Good. Hold still.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.911
- Forget the pen.
- Drat!

01:17.995 --> 01:20.956
When are you gonna tell me
what happened between you and Luke?

01:21.039 --> 01:23.792
Was it bad? I'm sure it was bad,
but how bad is bad?

01:23.876 --> 01:26.044
- It was nothing.
- Really?

01:26.128 --> 01:30.299
Look, I was upset, he was upset,
we had a thing. It's over, we're fine.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.925
- A thing?
- A tiny thing.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.719
- A tiny thing?
- A thinglet, if you will.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.762
You and Luke don't have thinglets often.

01:35.846 --> 01:38.348
Everybody has thinglets.
Part of being a grown-up.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.726
- What did he say? What did you say?
- Please.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.769
Okay, fine. Just answer me this.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.688
- We are on our way to Luke's?
- Right.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.232
- When we get there, will we get in?
- Of course.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.442
- We'll get served?
- Yes.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.860
- We'll get coffee?
- Maybe.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.069
- Refills?
- Eventually.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.404
- Free refills?
- In a month.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.323
The thinglet has grown into a thing.

01:54.406 --> 01:57.576
Rory, Luke and I have fought before.
God knows we'll fight again.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.828
But it's over. It's history. We'll go in...

01:59.912 --> 02:02.789
he'll be crabby, I'll be adorable,
he'll forget everything...

02:02.873 --> 02:05.834
- and that, as they say, will be that.
- Okay.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.961
- Hey, is there a line?
- Closed.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.170
- What?
- Closed.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.548
- Luke's is closed?
- Luke's is never closed.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.300
- I know.
- You sure it's closed?

02:13.383 --> 02:17.346
First I read the sign, then I tried the door
in case it was some elaborate ruse.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.806
- Designed to keep you out?
- There's precedent.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.351
- Luke's gone fishing. That's great.
- It is?

02:22.434 --> 02:24.895
Yes. He works hard,
he needed a break, he took it.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.941
- I think it's good. Healthy.
- For who? I have blood sugar issues.

02:29.024 --> 02:31.735
- Mom, it's because...
- No, it isn't.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.987
- But he never...
- Well, now he did.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.823
Rory, he took a trip.
Don't read anything into it.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.284
- It's because of the other night.
- No, it isn't.

02:39.368 --> 02:42.037
Even if it is, it'll go away.
Everything will be fine.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.624
Speak for yourself.
I left my wallet in there yesterday.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074

03:46.101 --> 03:49.021
- Why are we standing?
- The sign says, 'Wait to be seated. '

03:49.062 --> 03:52.608
Yeah, but we are not automatons,
we are rule breakers...

03:52.691 --> 03:55.027
and there are 50 open tables.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.113
- You're exaggerating.
- One, two, three, four, fifty. I'm not.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.032
I'm sure someone will help us soon.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.869
We should be eating. I'm hungry.
This is crazy. Don't they want us eating?

04:03.952 --> 04:07.456
Isn't that the point of The Hungry Diner?
To feed the hungry diner?

04:07.539 --> 04:09.958
Or is the point to keep
the hungry diner hungry?

04:10.042 --> 04:12.211
They should call it
The Eternally Hungry Diner...

04:12.294 --> 04:15.547
- 'cause you won't get any food here, loser.
- That'll be quite a sign.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.968
I'll give these paper-top turkey heads
three seconds to seat us or I'm gonna...

04:20.093 --> 04:21.386
- Two?
- Yes, please.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.596
- You'll what?
- What?

04:22.679 --> 04:25.224
You said you'll do something
if they didn't help us.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.391
- I did?
- Yes.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.228
Then the waitress came over,
and you never finished.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.647
Get some food into you.
You're imagining things.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.649
- What would you do?
- You're getting screwy.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.150
- Mom!
- I'm not your mom.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.694
- Do you need help, little girl?
- Oh, my God.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.821
- How's this?
- Perfect. Thanks.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.616
- Can I bring you coffee to start?
- To start and finish.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.409
- You need a little pick-me-up?
- Do I?

04:44.451 --> 04:45.994
Back in a jiff.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.373
When she comes back,
we'll hold her down...

04:49.456 --> 04:51.291
and tell her ugly things about the world.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.669
Get your daughter to help you
with your evil plan.

04:53.752 --> 04:54.920
Make nice.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.507
How convenient.
They have pictures of all the food...

04:58.590 --> 05:01.260
in case you've been in a cave
for the last 50 years...

05:01.301 --> 05:03.804
and have no idea
what a stack of pancakes looks like.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.973
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Yes, sweetie?

05:06.056 --> 05:09.393
- What are the tiny cups for?
- They're coffee cups. They're for coffee.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.311
- Are you running out?
- I'm sorry?

05:11.395 --> 05:14.106
Never mind. Listen, we are
very sleepy this morning...

05:14.189 --> 05:16.900
so would you happen to have
something in a larger size?

05:16.984 --> 05:19.736
Say, a mug, a tureen,
a small bowl of some kind?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.655
- A coffee bowl?
- Yes, a coffee bowl.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.449
- Two, please.
- We don't have coffee bowls. I'm sorry.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.326
Then would you mind bringing...

05:26.410 --> 05:28.412
- What do you think, two, three?
- Three's good.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.372
Three of these cute little cuppy things...

05:30.455 --> 05:33.333
and could you leave the pot
in the meantime?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.670
It looks like coffee, smells like coffee.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.673
- The comparison stops there.
- This sucks!

05:39.756 --> 05:41.800
Just put a lot of stuff
so you can't taste it.

05:41.884 --> 05:45.137
How will I fit my three sugars
into Barbie's Malibu Dream Cup here?

05:45.179 --> 05:48.348
- It'll be all sugar and no coffee.
- You might prefer it that way.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.768
- Well, well, well.
- What?

05:52.227 --> 05:53.979
I'll be right back.

05:57.566 --> 06:01.195
So, what's new for fall?
I hear the sailor suit is hot.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.071
What are you doing here?

06:03.155 --> 06:06.658
- Luke's is closed this morning.
- By the health inspector, no doubt.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.621
This is where you have your breakfast?

06:10.704 --> 06:13.248
- Until this morning, yes.
- How's the grub?

06:13.332 --> 06:15.751
They make an excellent
egg-white omelet, no oil.

06:15.834 --> 06:16.835
Really?

06:16.919 --> 06:18.921
They use the spray... Can you leave now?

06:19.004 --> 06:20.506
You never told me about this place.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.509
You might eat here,
and there would be no corner of my life...

06:23.592 --> 06:26.637
which would be free
of your incessant scrutiny.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.722
What are you doing with the fork?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.474
- Can I have a bite?
- What?

06:30.557 --> 06:32.893
- Just a taste.
- Get away from me.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.104
Michel, don't go! Come eat with us.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.524
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Not really.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.900
Good. It's a date.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.985
- You, me, here tomorrow?
- Never.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.243
- I'm beginning to like this place.
- I'm glad.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.828
- Mom, I need to ask you a favor.
- Ask away.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.122
I need you to get me out of dinner tonight.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.834
Dean's coming and he doesn't know
about the accident.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.877
If I'm not there the second he gets home...

06:58.919 --> 07:01.380
then someone else will tell him,
and that would be...

07:01.421 --> 07:02.714
Horrible. I agree.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.217
- I really hate to ask you this.
- Forget about it.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.468
- Really?
- Absolutely.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.762
- Make things right with Dean.
- I appreciate this.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.181
No problem.
It gives me extra time to work...

07:11.265 --> 07:14.059
on my why-Rory's-wearing-a-cast story
for your grandparents.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.312
- Yeah? What have you got so far?
- Really big bees.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.692
- It's good you've got the time.
- Yeah, it is.

07:22.234 --> 07:25.988
I'm so sorry Rory isn't feeling well.
Is it that flu that's been going around?

07:26.071 --> 07:28.907
- Yes, it is.
- Horrible strain.

07:28.991 --> 07:32.786
Bunny Carlington Munchausen has been
bedridden for two straight weeks.

07:32.870 --> 07:35.581
It must wipe her out
just toting that name around.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.209
Should I take a drink for Richard?
I hate to disturb him when he's working.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.461
- He's working? Like, work-working?
- That's right.

07:41.545 --> 07:44.923
His articles of incorporation
arrived last week. He's rented an office.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.051
Your father is now the president and CEO
of the Gilmore Group...

07:48.135 --> 07:50.429
an international insurance consulting firm.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.222
Wow, that's great.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.437
- What's his job?
- He's a consultant.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.521
Meaning?

07:59.605 --> 08:02.191
Your father is
an international insurance consultant.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.359
Yeah, but what exactly does that mean?

08:04.443 --> 08:07.154
He consults on matters
related to international insurance.

08:07.237 --> 08:10.657
Wait. When Dad goes to his new office,
he sits down, and he...

08:10.741 --> 08:13.452
Consults with international clients
on insurance matters.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.871
I don't know why
we're not opening for Rickles.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.540
- Damn it!
- Richard? Are you all right?

08:19.041 --> 08:22.085
No, I am not all right.
That was Margie just now on the phone.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.087
- How is she?
- Who is she?

08:24.171 --> 08:25.631
You know very well who Margie is.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.342
She's been your father's secretary
since you were a child.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.719
Largie Margie.
Very clever when you're six.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.889
In answer to your question, Emily,
Margie is well.

08:33.972 --> 08:37.558
So well, in fact, that she has decided
not to join me in my new business.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.645
- What?
- She's staying with the old firm.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.773
But you were the only reason
she even had a job at that firm.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.651
I went to great pains
to remind her of just that.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.736
This is simply unacceptable!

08:47.819 --> 08:50.364
You and that rotund ingrate
had an agreement.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.659
- There was an agreement in writing?
- Not in writing per se...

08:53.742 --> 08:55.827
but she helped me procure my new office.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.163
She arranged
to have all my things sent over.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.999
All that was left was for her
to accept my formal offer.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.835
A generous one, if I may say so.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.755
- And she just turned you down?
- She had the gall to counteroffer.

09:06.839 --> 09:09.466
She kept insisting
that I match her current salary.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.636
You weren't even offering
to match the poor woman's salary?

09:12.719 --> 09:15.514
Lorelai, the Gilmore Group
is a fledgling enterprise.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.308
I can't afford to pay Margie
her full salary right away.

09:18.392 --> 09:22.020
But after 20 years,
where is the woman's sense of loyalty?

09:22.396 --> 09:24.606
I don't know. Maybe with the company...

09:24.690 --> 09:27.734
that's keeping her from
standing in line for government cheese.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.903
At this point,
I don't know how to proceed.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.030
- Of course you don't.
- I had counted on this.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.282
Of course you had.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.325
Perhaps I should reconsider going forward.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.952
- That may be best.
- Excuse me?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.913
- I can't do it without Margie.
- No one would expect you to.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.248
You can't be serious.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.542
I wonder if it's too late
to get out of my lease.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.586
You should look into that immediately.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.883
There is a baby here
desperately in need of some bathwater.

09:50.966 --> 09:53.010
- What is she saying?
- What are you saying?

09:53.051 --> 09:55.596
I'm just saying
there are other options to consider.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.890
- Like what?
- Hire another secretary.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.017
No. Your father's had other secretaries.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.728
Three, in fact.
Each one worse than the previous one.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.688
- Until Margie.
- Margie was a gem.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.231
Margie did everything for him.

10:06.273 --> 10:10.068
Yes, but there are plenty of
other Margies out there...

10:10.152 --> 10:13.697
dying to be in that
co-dependent relationship with you.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.574
You will find one. Trust me.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.410
She may not be named Margie,
but if you pay her enough...

10:18.452 --> 10:21.997
- you can call her what you want.
- I don't have time to find someone new.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.209
The office is a disaster.
Everything is in boxes.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.836
I don't know where anything is
or how anything works.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.672
The computers, the phones,
even my office chair.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.466
Okay, Dad, I'll tell you what.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.052
Tomorrow afternoon
after my business class...

10:35.093 --> 10:38.972
I will come to your office.
We'll get you unpacked and settled.

10:39.056 --> 10:42.017
We'll find you someone as good as Margie,
or at least cheaper.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.936
I hate to see you waste your time.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.146
- I'll blindfold you then.
- I don't know.

10:46.939 --> 10:51.610
There's another Margie out there.
Honest. Just give it a chance.

10:52.069 --> 10:55.197
- An office without Margie.
- Seems inconceivable.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.282
Dream with me here, folks.

11:11.213 --> 11:12.506
Hi, Rory.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.008
What happened?
What did you do to your arm?

11:15.092 --> 11:16.176
Here.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.970
- What is this?
- Just read it.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.430
What's going on?
Tell me how you hurt your arm.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.683
It's all in the letter. Read.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.607
- I love you, too.
- Good.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.862
- Now hold on to that feeling for a minute.
- Why?

11:34.945 --> 11:37.656
- Just...
- Read. All right, I'm reading.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.538
- What?
- Keep going.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.671
- What?
- Turn it over.

11:58.468 --> 11:59.511
What?

11:59.595 --> 12:02.681
Go on. You have three more 'whats'
ahead of you.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.979
It gets better at the end.

12:09.605 --> 12:12.441
I'll just stand here until you get there.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.004
- Is he really gone?
- Yes.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.846
- Want to come in?
- What?

12:43.096 --> 12:47.017
You can stay for dinner. My mom's
making a roast. You like roast, right?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.062
Yeah, I like roast.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.981
Okay. Come on.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.867
Then we just watched TV.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.870
You mean you 'watched TV?'
Use the air quotes, sweetie.

13:06.954 --> 13:10.374
- His little sister was there.
- So you watched TV. Go on.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.543
And then he walked me home.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.211
- That's it?
- That's it.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.671
- Did he kiss you good night?
- Yep.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.464
- Didn't ask about the other night?
- No.

13:17.548 --> 13:19.091
- Didn't ask about the car?
- Not once.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.175
And Jess?

13:20.259 --> 13:22.845
He just asked if he was really gone.
And that was it.

13:22.928 --> 13:25.389
I thought he would yell, scream,
and want to break up.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.933
- Instead, he gave me his corn.
- He did? When?

13:27.975 --> 13:30.102
- At dinner.
- So you were already eating.

13:30.185 --> 13:33.397
It wasn't just an out of the blue,
'I give you my corn. ' Got it.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.108
Maybe it hasn't sunk in.
Maybe he'll be mad tomorrow.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.443
Maybe he's even more terrific
than we thought.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.405
- It's not covering the whole cast.
- Relax. I'm not finished.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.283
- Do you really think he's okay with it?
- Sounds like it.

13:44.366 --> 13:47.202
If the situation were reversed,
I wouldn't be okay with it.

13:47.286 --> 13:50.831
If the situation was reversed,
Dean wouldn't let Jess drive his car.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.667
I guess I should just be grateful, then?

13:53.750 --> 13:56.211
- Grateful, absolutely.
- What are these?

13:56.295 --> 13:58.755
These are résumés
for your grandpa's new secretary.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.132
There are, like, 100 of them.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.384
The world is full of eager, young people...

14:02.467 --> 14:05.512
waiting to have the life
sucked out of them by Richard Gilmore.

14:05.596 --> 14:08.599
Okay, I'm finished.
What do you think of that?

14:08.724 --> 14:11.643
If we were gazelles,
we'd be eaten first at the watering hole.

14:11.727 --> 14:14.271
Be thankful we're not gazelles.
Go take your shower.

14:14.313 --> 14:17.774
You're starting to look like
you're starring in an independent film.

14:20.152 --> 14:23.238
Dean knows you. He knows
you wouldn't do anything to hurt him.

14:23.322 --> 14:25.782
So you're lucky. Just focus on that.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.452
Jess is gone. Now you guys can start over.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.497
And even though the box says it's safe...

14:31.538 --> 14:35.459
I want you to keep your arm
out of the microwave for at least a week.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.178
- Dad?
- Come in.

14:49.306 --> 14:52.684
So, let me guess. The Wu-Tang Clan
had the office before you.

14:52.768 --> 14:54.311
It's a bit disheveled.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.773
- It's freezing in here.
- Yes, it has been since I moved in.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.816
Did you try adjusting the thermostat?

14:59.858 --> 15:01.818
Yes. That only seemed to make it angry.

15:01.860 --> 15:05.697
You've been Nanooking it the whole time?
Sending for whale blubber and mukluks?

15:05.739 --> 15:09.159
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You don't know what you're...

15:10.327 --> 15:13.539
- The wind done gone.
- So it would seem, for the moment.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.166
No, I turned it off. Let me show you.

15:16.250 --> 15:19.211
- Do you want to get that?
- No, they've already hung up.

15:20.128 --> 15:24.049
Next time hold an envelope
up to your head before you do that.

15:24.091 --> 15:28.554
It's been doing it all day.
The phone rings once, then they're gone.

15:28.971 --> 15:31.723
Because your messages
are forwarded to your voice mail.

15:31.807 --> 15:33.725
See where it says voice mail?

15:33.767 --> 15:36.520
- How could that happen?
- I don't know. Where's your manual?

15:36.562 --> 15:39.106
- Manual.
- Came with the phone.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.692
Probably has a picture of a phone on it.

15:42.025 --> 15:45.195
Look what I found under your copper-ball-
glued-to-the-wood thing.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.905
No, it's brass.

15:47.114 --> 15:51.201
One of the firm's parting gifts
as they nudged me into retirement.

15:51.285 --> 15:54.454
So in addition to being heavy and ugly,
it's also insulting.

15:54.538 --> 15:57.082
- Quite.
- There you go. That should work.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.710
- Want to call me from your office?
- This is my office.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.921
- Whose office is that?
- Yes, excellent idea.

16:05.048 --> 16:08.135
- That isn't me calling.
- Didn't think so. Should I get that?

16:08.218 --> 16:09.386
Yes, please.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.723
Hello, the Gilmore Group.

16:13.390 --> 16:18.270
Mr. Henson. Why, yes, he just walked out.
May I take a message?

16:21.273 --> 16:23.609
How are you spelling 'Larry?'

16:25.819 --> 16:27.613
Traditionally? Great.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.657
Okay. Thank you for calling. Bye-bye.

16:31.283 --> 16:34.411
- Where the hell are your pens?
- Watch your language, young lady.

16:34.453 --> 16:37.331
- What did Larry want?
- He wants to know where your pens are.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.792
He wants you to call him.
Where are all the office supplies?

16:40.876 --> 16:42.628
I haven't gotten around to that yet.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.589
Before anything else can happen,
you need pens, paper.

16:45.631 --> 16:48.258
You need everything else, don't you?

16:48.342 --> 16:50.802
Especially since I may be tempted
to wash my hand.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.931
- Where does one get these?
- Where did you used to get them?

16:54.014 --> 16:56.725
- From Margie.
- From Margie. I saw that coming.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.937
All right. Well, let's go.

17:06.902 --> 17:09.780
Good Lord, this place goes on forever!

17:09.820 --> 17:13.282
It goes on until chair mats and floor mats,
but if you're not careful...

17:13.367 --> 17:16.662
you'll loop back into inks and toners
and be here all day. Stay close.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.747
There's a seat in the cart
if you want a ride.

17:18.830 --> 17:21.625
I'll pass. Look at the scale of this place.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.419
No one needs all these options.
It's oppressive.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.548
Hundreds of paper clips
in every conceivable color and size.

17:27.631 --> 17:30.217
Who on earth would buy these things?

17:30.300 --> 17:31.510
We would.

17:31.552 --> 17:35.430
Now, what's the first thing you do
when you get to the office in the morning?

17:35.514 --> 17:38.225
Well, let's see.
I return the calls from Asia first.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.103
That's right, you make coffee,
so you need a coffee maker.

17:41.186 --> 17:45.399
Let's see. Ugly, crappy, German, pretty.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.651
Well, as long as it's pretty.

17:47.693 --> 17:50.153
Why is everything worth having
just out of reach?

17:50.195 --> 17:54.324
Is there no one here whose job it is
to actually assist paying customers?

17:54.408 --> 17:57.369
No. That's how they can afford
to sell this baby for 40% off.

17:57.411 --> 17:59.371
40% off? I had no idea.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.751
Nicely done, Dad. You won't be sorry.

18:05.544 --> 18:08.213
It's suddenly becoming clear to me
that I'm an old man.

18:08.297 --> 18:11.925
I don't recognize half the whatsits
and doodads in here.

18:12.009 --> 18:14.011
Here we have an assortment
of magic sticks...

18:14.052 --> 18:16.555
and when you press down on paper,
writing comes out.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.056
I know what pens are.

18:18.140 --> 18:22.686
Good. Pick out your favorites, and I'll try
to figure out how to explain Liquid Paper.

18:22.728 --> 18:24.313
You're cute.

18:25.063 --> 18:28.734
- I can't possibly use all of those.
- You won't. You'll lose half of them.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.612
Then you'll be really happy
to have the ones you have left.

18:31.695 --> 18:33.071
Now, paper.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.533
All right. This ought to do nicely for now.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.535
Are you going into business
for two weeks?

18:38.577 --> 18:41.622
You're building an empire.
Think big, Gilmore!

18:41.914 --> 18:44.625
Plus, if you get the box, it's cheaper.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.878
Hey, how do you
happen to know all of this?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.213
It's how we do it at the inn.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.341
You have to spend money to make money.
Tip from me to you.

18:52.424 --> 18:53.759
Good point. What else?

18:53.842 --> 18:56.637
- I strongly recommend a stapler.
- Stapler.

18:56.929 --> 18:59.181
- Some extra staples.
- I'm way ahead of you.

18:59.264 --> 19:02.601
- Good man. Post-its.
- My goodness, look at all the Post-its.

19:02.643 --> 19:05.854
I had no idea they came
in so many shapes and colors.

19:05.938 --> 19:08.565
I'm going to get a 12-pack for myself
in various hues.

19:08.607 --> 19:10.859
- Wise move.
- And one for Emily.

19:10.943 --> 19:14.446
She posts notes on her vanity mirror
to remind her of various activities.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.907
- She'll think it's Christmas.
- Done.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.992
Now, what else is on the hit parade?

19:19.076 --> 19:23.455
Might be controversial, but I was thinking
of a three-hole punch if we can find one.

19:23.539 --> 19:26.708
I think we're both up to the challenge.
Shall we?

19:31.755 --> 19:35.175
- Dawn Powell? I've never heard of her.
- Nobody has, which is a shame...

19:35.259 --> 19:39.096
because she wrote 16 amazing novels,
nine plays and there are some who claim...

19:39.137 --> 19:42.474
it was Powell who made the jokes
that Dorothy Parker got credit for.

19:42.558 --> 19:43.934
- Blasphemy!
- I know.

19:43.976 --> 19:46.186
I won't hold it against her
till I have proof...

19:46.270 --> 19:48.355
she was involved
with the smear campaign.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.899
Look! They finally took
the boards off the windows.

19:50.983 --> 19:53.360
- I wonder what it's going to be.
- I don't know.

19:53.443 --> 19:56.446
- What's that in the corner?
- I think it's a bass.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.324
It's a bass!
And there are guitars on the wall.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.909
Oh, my God, it's a music shop!

20:00.993 --> 20:04.204
Much better than the ceramic circus store
we thought was going in.

20:04.288 --> 20:07.958
I can't believe it! Stars Hollow
has taken its first steps toward being cool.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.168
I wonder when it'll open.

20:09.251 --> 20:12.462
If you keep pushing on the glass,
much sooner than anticipated.

20:14.089 --> 20:16.258
- Hey, hold on a sec.
- Why? What's wrong?

20:16.341 --> 20:18.468
Nothing. I'll be right back.

20:20.971 --> 20:23.307
- Taylor.
- Rory, hello.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.559
Hi. Listen, I just wanted to...

20:25.642 --> 20:28.854
- Just look at that arm.
- It's fine, really.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.522
- Does it hurt?
- No, not much.

20:30.606 --> 20:34.484
I hope you're not getting addicted
to painkillers like those Hollywood people.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.695
I'm not. Don't worry.

20:36.737 --> 20:39.323
Good, because pain
is your body's way of saying...

20:39.406 --> 20:41.867
'I'm not okay now, but I will be soon. '

20:41.950 --> 20:43.202
I will remember that.

20:43.243 --> 20:46.663
You don't want to shut your body up
too soon. That's called death.

20:46.705 --> 20:47.706
Right.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.668
Taylor, listen, I just wanted
to apologize to you.

20:51.752 --> 20:53.837
- About what?
- About the other night.

20:53.879 --> 20:57.549
My car hit the bench that had
your brand-new Doose's Market sign on it.

20:57.633 --> 21:01.178
I know how much that sign meant to you.
I am so sorry it was ruined.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.138
Well, it wasn't your fault.

21:03.222 --> 21:04.681
But my car hit the bench.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.559
Your car hit the bench
because that Jess was driving.

21:07.643 --> 21:09.019
Well, yeah, but...

21:09.061 --> 21:13.190
That boy is a walking natural disaster.
They should name a tornado after him!

21:13.232 --> 21:15.025
But he didn't cause it.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.194
You don't have to explain a thing to me.

21:17.277 --> 21:21.240
I know there's no way that you
would be involved in something like that...

21:21.323 --> 21:23.617
if it weren't for that Sal Mineo wannabe.

21:23.700 --> 21:28.455
Believe me, Chachi and Chachi alone
will be held responsible for that incident.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.374
Okay? Good.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.086
- Now, take a peach.
- Thanks.

21:36.713 --> 21:39.216
- So, is he mad?
- No, not at me.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.927
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah, that's good.

22:06.660 --> 22:09.079
That's my home phone number,
my pager number...

22:09.121 --> 22:11.456
my cell number
and a partial list of references.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.543
I'll hang on to this,
but as I said before, we just opened...

22:14.626 --> 22:17.212
so I'm not really looking
to hire anybody right now.

22:17.296 --> 22:19.756
I am licensed to carry a gun,
if that will help.

22:19.798 --> 22:21.884
You have no idea how much.

22:33.854 --> 22:36.440
- Can I help you?
- No, thank you, I was just looking.

22:36.481 --> 22:39.484
We like the looking.
It's the touching we're a little iffy on.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.361
Actually, I was just going...

22:41.445 --> 22:43.822
That would have been construed
as touching, huh?

22:43.864 --> 22:45.324
- Yes.
- Right.

22:47.659 --> 22:48.785
Oh, my.

22:48.869 --> 22:51.330
That's a DW drum set
with Zildjian cymbals.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.831
- It's beautiful.
- You play?

22:52.915 --> 22:54.124
Oh, no. I wish.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.209
- Sit.
- What?

22:55.292 --> 22:57.211
- Sit down. See how it feels.
- I couldn't.

22:57.294 --> 22:59.505
- Why, your legs don't bend?
- No, they bend.

22:59.546 --> 23:03.634
- If they bend, then bend them.
- Well, okay.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.349
- This is a good stool.
- Yes, it is. Here.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.809
You can't sit down at a drum set
without your sticks.

23:12.851 --> 23:14.978
Right, 'cause that would be stupid.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.897
Remember, no touching.

23:22.027 --> 23:24.571
- You look good.
- Thanks.

23:29.993 --> 23:33.497
Granted, the European insurance market
still needs some restructuring...

23:33.539 --> 23:37.084
but it's growing at a remarkable rate.
What am I basing it on?

23:37.167 --> 23:39.753
Clive, surely you've seen
the latest Eurostat.

23:39.837 --> 23:42.965
Yes, I've got it right in front of me.
Eurostat.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.634
Yes, here it is. Let's see.

23:47.302 --> 23:49.596
The highest contributions
in absolute terms...

23:49.680 --> 23:53.684
were reached in the United Kingdom,
Germany, and the Netherlands.

23:54.393 --> 23:59.147
Yes, I would have to look up those
specific coding and reference numbers.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.193
Yes, I've got them right here.

24:03.277 --> 24:05.737
For the year 2001.

24:07.406 --> 24:08.991
Here they are.

24:10.409 --> 24:12.411
Are you interested in the Netherlands?

24:12.494 --> 24:14.246
That market will go through the roof.

24:14.288 --> 24:15.873
Gilmore Group. May I help you?

24:15.956 --> 24:17.666
Margie doesn't work for the company.

24:17.749 --> 24:21.086
I'm the one who called to schedule
the DSL appointment. Well, no.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.881
We really need the DSL line
installed today.

24:23.922 --> 24:26.049
It's just awful being without it.

24:26.091 --> 24:30.721
Okay, if you can make it before 5:00,
everything's good...

24:30.762 --> 24:32.431
but any later than that won't work...

24:32.514 --> 24:35.684
because the cable modem people
are dropping by about 5:05.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.437
Thank you. That's great. Okay, bye-bye.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.732
- They'll be here in 20 minutes.
- I must say, I'm impressed.

24:41.773 --> 24:44.109
- I'm no Margie.
- Who needs her?

24:44.193 --> 24:46.153
- Speaking of which...
- What's this?

24:46.236 --> 24:48.780
The secretarial candidates
for tomorrow's interviews.

24:48.864 --> 24:50.407
I've looked at them carefully...

24:50.449 --> 24:53.327
and somewhere in there
is a Margie for the new millennium.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.786
- I'll get it.
- No.

24:54.828 --> 24:57.789
Get to know your new secretary.
I don't mind.

24:58.582 --> 25:00.000
Gilmore Group. May I help you?

25:00.083 --> 25:02.252
Yes. Richard Gilmore, please.

25:03.587 --> 25:06.131
Certainly. May I ask who's calling?

25:06.215 --> 25:09.593
- Emily Gilmore.
- And does he know what this is about?

25:09.635 --> 25:11.136
I hope so. I'm his wife.

25:12.137 --> 25:15.098
Richard didn't say anything
about being married.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.476
- What?
- Mom, relax. It's me.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.311
- Lorelai?
- Yes.

25:19.353 --> 25:23.106
- You're crude and unprofessional.
- I'd like that on my tombstone.

25:23.148 --> 25:24.316
What can I do for you?

25:24.399 --> 25:28.820
I'm throwing a cocktail party at the office
on Friday to help launch the new business.

25:28.904 --> 25:33.075
The caterers will be arriving
at 3:00 sharp to set up, so...

25:33.492 --> 25:35.619
Are you writing this down? You should be.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.789
- I'm scribbling furiously.
- Margie always wrote everything down.

25:38.872 --> 25:40.499
Does this mean no Friday night dinner?

25:40.582 --> 25:43.669
- It means we'll see you both at the party.
- Bye.

25:45.504 --> 25:48.340
Rory, sweetie, hold on there, baby!

25:48.632 --> 25:51.385
Hey, Babette. Is everything okay?

25:51.468 --> 25:56.014
I should be asking you that question.
Come here! Let me see that arm.

25:56.098 --> 25:59.643
You poor little thing. How you doing?

25:59.685 --> 26:01.103
I'm doing fine.

26:01.186 --> 26:04.356
Look at you being brave like that
after all you've been through.

26:04.731 --> 26:08.110
- It's so hard being a woman, isn't it?
- I guess.

26:08.193 --> 26:11.280
You got your morals, your standards,
and good common sense...

26:11.363 --> 26:14.700
and then you meet some guy,
and all that goes right out the window.

26:14.783 --> 26:18.662
For every good woman, there's a dirty
little wolf ready to lead her astray!

26:18.704 --> 26:20.998
You can't help it. He's got the eyes...

26:21.039 --> 26:24.251
the chin, chest hair you could carpet
your dining room with.

26:24.334 --> 26:28.046
I mean, what's a woman to do?
We're not made of steel, for God's sakes!

26:28.213 --> 26:30.841
I was in a cult once! Did I tell you that?

26:30.883 --> 26:32.885
- No.
- I met this guy once.

26:32.968 --> 26:36.180
Gorgeous, tan,
looked just like Mickey Hargitay.

26:36.221 --> 26:39.391
We had coffee. He gave me a pamphlet.
Next thing you know...

26:39.474 --> 26:41.518
I'm wearing a muumuu,
playing a tambourine...

26:41.602 --> 26:44.897
- jumping up and down at the airport!
- I really have to get inside.

26:44.938 --> 26:47.191
Sure, honey. Take good care of yourself.

26:47.232 --> 26:50.235
And don't be embarrassed, toots!
This has happened to all of us.

26:53.405 --> 26:55.073
Mom, are you here?

26:59.453 --> 27:02.414
Hey, you. It's me.
I'm gonna be home late today.

27:02.498 --> 27:04.416
Trying to find Grandpa a Margie.

27:04.500 --> 27:09.087
Order pizza. Money's under the rabbi.
Hope your arm's feeling okay. Bye-bye.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.577
- I have found my calling.
- What are you talking about?

27:40.619 --> 27:43.038
I'm talking about my future, my path...

27:43.121 --> 27:45.958
my destiny, my thing, my scene, my bag.

27:46.041 --> 27:49.503
I'm talking about the number-one item
on my cosmic to-do list!

27:49.586 --> 27:50.754
Which is?

27:50.796 --> 27:52.923
- I'm gonna be a drummer!
- You're kidding!

27:52.965 --> 27:56.426
I went into that new music store today.
I don't know why. I just had to.

27:56.510 --> 27:59.638
Something told me, 'There's something
in there you need to see. '

27:59.721 --> 28:03.141
And there it was. It was red and shiny.
I'm so excited I can't breathe!

28:03.225 --> 28:04.768
- That's amazing.
- I know.

28:04.852 --> 28:06.562
- How will you do this?
- I don't know.

28:06.645 --> 28:08.480
- How will you buy a drum set?
- I don't know.

28:08.564 --> 28:10.482
Even if you buy one,
where will you play it?

28:10.566 --> 28:13.652
I don't know any of this,
but I will figure something out...

28:13.735 --> 28:18.574
because I am Keith Moon! I am Neil Peart!
I am Rick Allen, with and without the arm!

28:18.657 --> 28:20.909
Because I am rock 'n' roll, baby!

28:20.993 --> 28:22.744
I'll call you later.

28:39.344 --> 28:41.847
When she opened her own office,
she asked me to come...

28:41.930 --> 28:44.141
as her executive assistant
and office manager...

28:44.183 --> 28:47.019
- which was a terrific opportunity.
- I bet.

28:47.686 --> 28:50.314
- How so?
- In that I was able to build that office...

28:50.355 --> 28:53.775
and its staff from the ground up
and develop a system from scratch.

28:53.859 --> 28:55.277
So you have a system.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.030
Which helped double productivity
and billing hours...

28:58.113 --> 29:00.866
but then she got pregnant,
and here we are.

29:00.949 --> 29:03.619
Wow. Story of my life. Literally.

29:03.702 --> 29:07.831
Well, thank you for coming in, Karen.

29:08.707 --> 29:10.918
We'll let you know
once we make our decision.

29:11.001 --> 29:14.129
Thank you, Mr. Gilmore.
It was a pleasure meeting you both.

29:14.213 --> 29:16.173
Here. I'll walk you out.

29:17.508 --> 29:20.719
Love what's going on with your shoes,
by the way.

29:23.597 --> 29:27.184
- Hey, look what I found.
- Good. Lunch. I'm starving!

29:27.809 --> 29:30.812
- Do you want to eat in here today?
- Sure. Why not?

29:30.896 --> 29:33.690
Good, they threw in pickles like I asked.

29:33.899 --> 29:36.443
It's great having this place
just across the street.

29:36.527 --> 29:38.362
You'll never starve.

29:38.403 --> 29:42.074
Maybe we should start a tab with them
so we don't have to pay cash every day.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.159
- Already done.
- Amazing!

29:44.409 --> 29:48.038
You're like the tiny fellow on that
M* A *S*H program. Always anticipating.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.249
So, what do we think?

29:51.250 --> 29:53.585
- Tasty!
- No, I mean about Karen.

29:53.794 --> 29:55.087
- Who?
- Karen.

29:55.128 --> 29:57.631
The woman who was here.
The one with the system.

29:57.714 --> 29:59.216
Rather inexperienced, I thought.

29:59.299 --> 30:01.927
Dad, she worked as an executive assistant
for six years!

30:02.010 --> 30:04.471
She's young, and young women
tend to be flighty.

30:04.555 --> 30:07.724
She worked for the same woman
for five of those six years.

30:07.766 --> 30:10.435
This roast beef is delicious.
It's lean, it's tender.

30:10.519 --> 30:12.604
- What did you get?
- Cheeseburger.

30:12.688 --> 30:15.774
I may get one myself if we order
from the same place tomorrow.

30:15.858 --> 30:19.278
Tomorrow? You mean
for more secretary interviews?

30:19.319 --> 30:20.904
Whatever's on the agenda.

30:20.988 --> 30:23.365
Dad, you've already seen three people...

30:23.448 --> 30:26.160
who would be
absolutely perfect for the job.

30:26.243 --> 30:28.453
You can't rush these things, Lorelai.

30:28.495 --> 30:31.623
A man's secretary sets the tone
for the entire enterprise.

30:31.707 --> 30:34.960
- I know that, but...
- It has to do with chemistry...

30:35.002 --> 30:37.754
which cannot be manufactured
out of sheer necessity.

30:37.796 --> 30:40.799
Besides, you and I seem to be doing
just fine for the moment.

30:40.883 --> 30:43.927
Yes, for the moment.
But the moment is coming to a rapid end.

30:43.969 --> 30:45.053
What do you mean?

30:45.137 --> 30:47.681
I can't work here
'cause I have my own job.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.141
I know that, Lorelai.

30:49.224 --> 30:51.935
I need you to find an assistant soon,
like, now...

30:51.977 --> 30:53.896
because I don't know when I'll come back.

30:53.979 --> 30:56.190
I need to see more résumés.
In the meantime...

30:56.273 --> 31:00.152
- Dad, I cannot come back here tomorrow.
- I see.

31:00.235 --> 31:03.280
I didn't mean that to sound so harsh.
I meant...

31:03.322 --> 31:06.617
I know exactly what you meant to say.
I got the message.

31:07.159 --> 31:10.579
Well, I won't keep you any longer.
I know how busy you are.

31:10.662 --> 31:13.957
Dad, I didn't mean I have to go right now.
We can finish our lunch.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.250
I'm finished.

31:15.334 --> 31:18.253
Will you leave the phone number
of the sandwich shop for me?

31:18.337 --> 31:19.796
I'll need it.

31:19.838 --> 31:22.299
All the numbers you need
are there on your desk.

31:22.341 --> 31:24.384
Good. Now, if you'll excuse me...

31:24.468 --> 31:28.722
I have some of my own work to attend to.
Thank you for all your help.

31:34.686 --> 31:37.773
Dad, if it makes any difference,
I thought that Karen was...

31:37.856 --> 31:39.191
Thank you.

31:43.695 --> 31:44.822
Here.

31:45.864 --> 31:47.866
You know, there will be food there.

31:47.950 --> 31:51.078
Finger food, a. k. a.
'Snooty little balls of attitude. '

31:51.161 --> 31:55.207
- Oh, boy.
- I need real food. Peasant food!

31:55.457 --> 31:59.545
Hearty bread, meat, cheese,
little pickle chips, a sauce!

31:59.628 --> 32:02.881
A special sauce. This is the food
that sustains me. The food...

32:02.923 --> 32:04.550
Just eat the burger already!

32:04.633 --> 32:06.552
- Crabby!
- I'm not crabby.

32:06.635 --> 32:09.555
- I didn't finish my special sauce speech!
- Sorry.

32:09.596 --> 32:12.766
- Does your arm hurt?
- No, I'm just tired, I guess.

32:12.850 --> 32:15.143
All right, we won't stay very long.

32:15.227 --> 32:18.480
Just long enough to get five or six
withering stares from my dad...

32:18.564 --> 32:22.359
and be taken down three or four notches
by my mother. Then we're out of there.

32:24.069 --> 32:26.113
- Not good?
- Really not good.

32:26.196 --> 32:29.908
I swear, Luke better come back soon,
or I'm gonna starve to death.

32:31.994 --> 32:33.871
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

32:33.912 --> 32:36.957
- Luke's gone because of me.
- Honey, he is not!

32:37.040 --> 32:39.918
Yes, he is. I got into an accident,
and you guys had a fight.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.671
Rory, it isn't your fault!
If it's anyone's fault...

32:42.754 --> 32:44.464
- Jess' fault.
- Well, yes!

32:44.548 --> 32:47.759
Why does everyone in this town
think that it is all Jess' fault?

32:47.801 --> 32:51.013
- Let's not talk about this, okay?
- I was there too, you know!

32:51.096 --> 32:53.307
Rory, everyone here loves you.

32:53.390 --> 32:56.852
They know you're not the
get-in-an-accident-knock-over-a-bench girl.

32:56.935 --> 32:58.979
I know that and I appreciate that, but...

32:59.062 --> 33:03.066
I want you to stop beating yourself up
about this. It's over! Jess is gone.

33:03.150 --> 33:05.277
Let's forget about this, okay? Please?

33:05.360 --> 33:07.404
- Fine.
- Good.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.741
- Can you hand me that burger?
- You said it was bad.

33:10.782 --> 33:15.078
That burger may be a disgusting burger,
but it considers me its equal.

33:20.959 --> 33:23.795
Oh, jeez, this is worse than the clowns
in the Volkswagen.

33:23.879 --> 33:26.757
- A lot of people.
- Do you want something to drink?

33:26.798 --> 33:28.759
We're three martinis behind everyone else.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.719
- Just water, I guess.
- Coming up.

33:30.802 --> 33:33.722
I should have brought breadcrumbs.
Excuse me.

33:37.392 --> 33:39.728
Lorelai, there you are. You're late.

33:39.811 --> 33:42.147
You scheduled this beer bash
during rush hour.

33:42.189 --> 33:43.774
When traffic is leaving Hartford.

33:43.815 --> 33:46.151
Not when Emily Gilmore
is throwing a party.

33:46.193 --> 33:48.570
Isn't it wonderful,
everyone coming for your father?

33:48.654 --> 33:52.032
Yeah, but don't you ever think about
scaling back a little?

33:52.115 --> 33:56.203
I scaled back a lot. I cut two appetizers,
I canceled the champagne fountain...

33:56.286 --> 33:59.873
and I reduced the catering staff
to six servers, not counting the point man.

33:59.957 --> 34:02.793
You can't not have a point man,
then what's the point?

34:02.835 --> 34:05.838
If you make it look cheap,
people think you're unsuccessful.

34:05.921 --> 34:07.130
Absolutely right.

34:07.172 --> 34:10.384
Better to deprive them of oxygen
so they don't have to think at all.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.969
- It is rather warm here.
- Want me to get the air going?

34:13.053 --> 34:15.054
- No, Karen knows how to do it.
- Karen?

34:15.138 --> 34:18.766
Your father's new secretary.
She's wonderful. Very professional.

34:18.851 --> 34:21.103
Karen, darling, would you mind...

34:21.186 --> 34:24.523
I'll have Karen draw up the contracts
in the morning.

34:25.649 --> 34:27.818
- Hi, Dad.
- Lorelai.

34:29.027 --> 34:32.406
- Swell party.
- Yes, it's mostly your mother's doing.

34:36.743 --> 34:39.538
- What just went down there?
- Down where?

34:39.621 --> 34:42.791
The handshake with the man
in the gray suit. Did you score a deal?

34:42.875 --> 34:45.252
One doesn't score deals
in the insurance business.

34:45.335 --> 34:49.005
One builds relationships based on trust
and fulfilling the client's needs.

34:49.047 --> 34:51.800
- Mr. Lundquist and I just...
- Mr. Lundquist?

34:51.884 --> 34:54.344
- Yes.
- Lindquist from Aero International?

34:54.386 --> 34:56.179
- Yes.
- You bagged the Swede?

34:56.221 --> 35:00.309
Just as I didn't score a deal,
I also haven't bagged the Swede.

35:00.392 --> 35:03.187
We simply talked. We came to
an agreement. We shook hands.

35:03.228 --> 35:06.815
- You shook hands! That means...
- I'll send him the contracts in the morning.

35:06.899 --> 35:09.276
- Dad, that's big!
- Yes, I suppose it is big.

35:09.359 --> 35:11.778
That's gigantic!
It's a whole new market for you.

35:11.862 --> 35:14.406
- It opens up all Scandinavia, doesn't it?
- Beyond that.

35:14.490 --> 35:16.742
Lundquist is his company's rep
for Russia as well.

35:16.825 --> 35:18.076
- Russia!
- Da.

35:18.368 --> 35:22.247
- Look who's taking over the world.
- I suppose that would be me!

35:24.208 --> 35:28.670
- I see that you hired Karen.
- Yes, I had to get someone in here.

35:28.754 --> 35:33.467
- She seems to be working out well.
- She's no Margie, but we'll see.

35:34.426 --> 35:38.138
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have several more deals to score...

35:38.222 --> 35:41.099
now that I have finished
bagging the Swede.

35:44.770 --> 35:48.440
- He's really in his element, isn't he?
- And happier than he's been in years!

35:48.774 --> 35:51.735
There's Rory.
I was wondering where she's...

35:52.194 --> 35:55.864
- What's that on her arm?
- I was gonna tell you about that.

35:55.948 --> 35:57.699
- Hi, Grandma.
- That's a cast.

35:57.783 --> 36:00.494
- That is a cast. She hurt her arm.
- When? How bad is it?

36:00.577 --> 36:02.955
- I fractured my wrist.
- Oh, my God!

36:03.038 --> 36:05.332
It's just a hairline fracture. It's tiny.

36:05.415 --> 36:07.793
- When did this happen?
- Last week.

36:08.001 --> 36:11.713
Last week? Why didn't you call me?
I can't believe you!

36:11.964 --> 36:14.675
- Well, I meant to.
- How did this happen?

36:14.758 --> 36:16.927
- Bees!
- I got in a car accident.

36:17.010 --> 36:19.304
- What?
- I got in a car accident!

36:19.555 --> 36:22.891
Oh, my God! How could you not tell us
she got into a car accident?

36:22.975 --> 36:25.435
Is this why she missed dinner?
You said she had the flu!

36:25.519 --> 36:27.104
I didn't want you to worry.

36:27.145 --> 36:29.773
Clearly there was nothing
to worry about!

36:29.982 --> 36:32.067
It was that car?
The one her boyfriend made.

36:32.150 --> 36:35.279
Richard was dead set against letting her
drive that deathmobile.

36:35.362 --> 36:37.656
- It wasn't the car, Mom.
- Well, then, what was it?

36:37.739 --> 36:39.491
A friend and I went to get ice cream.

36:39.575 --> 36:41.451
- Which friend? Lane?
- Jess.

36:41.493 --> 36:43.120
- Jess?
- Luke's nephew.

36:43.203 --> 36:46.331
Him? I thought you were going to
keep that boy away from her!

36:46.415 --> 36:49.585
- Mom, do we have to talk about this now?
- Yes, we have to!

36:49.668 --> 36:53.797
The child has a cast on her arm!
How could you be so irresponsible?

36:53.839 --> 36:55.841
- Mom, please.
- Don't 'Mom, please' me!

36:55.883 --> 36:59.178
It was your responsibility to stop this,
to make sure that...

36:59.219 --> 37:02.014
I gave him the keys! I told him to drive.

37:02.055 --> 37:04.349
He wanted to drive back to Luke's,
and I said no.

37:04.391 --> 37:07.477
I wanted to keep on driving.
That's when we got into the accident.

37:07.561 --> 37:10.314
This is just as much my fault,
as it is his. Maybe more.

37:11.023 --> 37:14.735
I've got this, Mom.
Can I see you in the hall for a second?

37:19.198 --> 37:21.200
- What the hell was that?
- I'm sick of this!

37:21.283 --> 37:24.244
I'm sick of everyone treating me
like I'm a mindless idiot...

37:24.328 --> 37:26.914
- led around by a guy.
- No one is treating you like that.

37:26.997 --> 37:30.375
Everyone is. The whole town is.
Taylor, Babette, Dean.

37:30.417 --> 37:32.961
Everyone, including you,
is refusing to believe...

37:33.045 --> 37:35.506
I was as responsible
for what happened as Jess was.

37:35.589 --> 37:37.049
Really? Were you driving the car?

37:37.132 --> 37:38.967
- No.
- Then you weren't as responsible.

37:39.051 --> 37:41.678
What if it was Dean?
What if Dean had been driving?

37:41.762 --> 37:43.555
Would everyone assume it was his fault?

37:43.597 --> 37:46.058
No, because Dean
wouldn't have been in an accident.

37:46.141 --> 37:48.685
Dean is a much more
responsible kid who loves you...

37:48.769 --> 37:50.771
and would drive more responsibly.

37:50.854 --> 37:53.899
- How do you know that Jess wasn't?
- Hi. It's Jess!

37:53.982 --> 37:58.153
Right, Jess is the Anti-Christ, I forgot.
He wanted to get into an accident.

37:58.237 --> 38:02.658
He's a murderer with a death wish
and he wanted to kill us both, right?

38:02.741 --> 38:05.786
I know you think that Jess is your friend,
but he's not.

38:05.869 --> 38:09.331
He is a completely out-of-control,
really angry kid...

38:09.414 --> 38:12.209
who has no respect for Luke,
who has no respect for me...

38:12.251 --> 38:14.169
- It was an accident!
- And he was driving!

38:14.253 --> 38:17.005
No matter what,
you're going to choose to blame Jess?

38:17.089 --> 38:19.550
- Yes, I choose to blame Jess.
- Because you hate him?

38:19.591 --> 38:22.719
That's right. I'm sorry.
When my daughter comes home broken...

38:22.761 --> 38:26.849
I get to hate the guy who broke her.
That's how it works. He's gone. I win.

38:26.932 --> 38:29.810
You are wearing a cast,
and I get to hate him forever.

38:29.893 --> 38:31.395
- Fine!
- Fine!

38:36.066 --> 38:40.279
I just had this image of 35 businessmen,
six servers, one point man...

38:40.320 --> 38:43.198
all leaning against that wall
with glasses to their ears.

38:43.407 --> 38:47.578
- I don't think they needed the glasses.
- We've got good lungs, you and I.

38:47.619 --> 38:49.037
We'll never agree on this.

38:49.121 --> 38:51.415
- You have to understand.
- I do.

38:51.456 --> 38:55.085
- I don't want to fight about this anymore.
- Neither do I.

38:57.462 --> 39:00.465
- Do you want to go back inside?
- No, I want to go home.

39:00.549 --> 39:02.134
My wrist hurts and I'm grumpy.

39:02.217 --> 39:05.053
I just made a total idiot of myself
so I want to go home.

39:05.137 --> 39:08.348
- All right, I'll tell Mom. I'll drive you.
- No, it's okay.

39:08.432 --> 39:11.977
It's still early. I can catch my regular bus.
You go back in.

39:12.060 --> 39:14.813
- Rory...
- I just want some alone time now.

39:14.855 --> 39:17.774
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'll see you back at home.

39:27.701 --> 39:29.912
It's after 6:00. We're closed!

39:29.995 --> 39:32.206
- Five more minutes?
- Nope. Now!

39:35.167 --> 39:37.628
- So, you're from New York?
- Yes, I am.

39:37.711 --> 39:40.172
- I want to go to New York some day.
- Good for you!

39:40.214 --> 39:41.924
- Did you like it?
- It was all right.

39:42.007 --> 39:44.843
- What part of New York did you live in?
- What's your name?

39:44.927 --> 39:47.596
- Lane Kim.
- Very nice to meet you, Lane Kim.

39:47.679 --> 39:50.140
You have got to get out of here
because I am closing...

39:50.224 --> 39:53.560
and you are not going to schmooze me
into forgetting that I'm closing.

39:53.644 --> 39:54.728
- Wait!
- What?

39:54.811 --> 39:57.689
- I have to have those drums!
- Great! Cash or credit?

39:57.731 --> 39:59.691
No, I have no money.

39:59.775 --> 40:02.402
Even if I did,
I couldn't take those home with me...

40:02.486 --> 40:05.948
because my mother would
never stop crying. So I have a proposal.

40:06.448 --> 40:09.076
Twice a week on Wednesday
and Friday nights at 6:00...

40:09.159 --> 40:12.621
- I could come and practice here.
- Wow, that sounds great.

40:12.704 --> 40:15.415
I'm not expecting you
to let me do this for free.

40:15.499 --> 40:19.086
I'll clean or do inventory, or stock stuff,
or whatever it is you need done.

40:19.169 --> 40:20.879
I don't need that much done.

40:20.963 --> 40:24.508
I can do other things, also, like...
Hey, do you know Korean?

40:24.550 --> 40:26.301
- No!
- Then I could teach you.

40:26.385 --> 40:29.888
- Why would I want to learn Korean?
- It's an interesting language!

40:29.972 --> 40:32.683
Being bilingual in this day and age
can only be a plus.

40:32.724 --> 40:36.562
- Please, go home!
- I can't go home until you say yes!

40:36.645 --> 40:40.274
I have to rock.
Please, I'm so begging you! Let me rock.

40:40.357 --> 40:44.570
- Why Wednesdays and Fridays?
- That's when my mom has her Bible group.

40:46.864 --> 40:51.243
- Okay, let's see what you got.
- Really? Oh, my God, thank you!

40:55.289 --> 40:57.875
- Can I hit them this time?
- Go ahead.

40:58.417 --> 40:59.543
Yes!

41:03.088 --> 41:06.341
I'll be in the back in case the cops come.

41:07.384 --> 41:10.095
Do you mind turning off the lights
on your way out?

41:10.179 --> 41:12.806
My mom sometimes walks home this way.

41:43.378 --> 41:45.422
Hey. You back?

41:45.964 --> 41:48.217
- I'm back.
- You catch anything?

41:50.052 --> 41:52.971
No, apparently the fish went fishing also.

41:53.388 --> 41:55.182
- Too bad.
- Yeah, well.

41:56.975 --> 41:59.311
- So, that's the...
- Yeah.

41:59.394 --> 42:02.981
- Does it hurt?
- No, not really. Just itches a little.

42:03.065 --> 42:06.109
Yeah, I can imagine.
Make sure you don't use a pencil.

42:06.193 --> 42:09.112
- Excuse me?
- Your arm, you know, when it itches?

42:09.154 --> 42:12.449
I broke my arm once.
Itching drove me crazy.

42:12.491 --> 42:15.828
Grabbed a pencil,
shoved it down the cast to scratch.

42:15.869 --> 42:17.704
- Bad results?
- Bad results.

42:17.788 --> 42:20.374
- Got it. No pencils, I promise.
- Good.

42:21.542 --> 42:24.545
- So, you want some coffee?
- Sure.

42:33.679 --> 42:35.180
Where's your mom tonight?

42:35.264 --> 42:38.016
- At a party for my grandpa.
- Sounds nice.

42:40.394 --> 42:42.437
Grab yourself a doughnut.

42:48.152 --> 42:50.279
So, have you heard from him?

42:50.737 --> 42:53.949
No, I talked to his mom, though.
He got home okay.

42:54.032 --> 42:56.368
- That's good.
- Yeah, good.

42:56.660 --> 42:59.329
- What about his stuff?
- I'm gonna send it.

42:59.371 --> 43:01.165
Right. Makes sense.

43:05.544 --> 43:07.421
- Luke?
- Yeah?

43:08.463 --> 43:11.717
- It wasn't his fault.
- I know it wasn't.
