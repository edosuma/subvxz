WEBVTT

00:08.217 --> 00:11.804
I'm sorry
I broke your expensive bachelor vase.

00:11.888 --> 00:12.805
[audience] Aww.

00:12.889 --> 00:15.934
That's all right. I've learned
that when you're in a loving family

00:16.015 --> 00:19.061
there's nothing wrong
with a little horsin' around.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.396
[laughter, applause]

00:20.479 --> 00:21.313
[Herb] Cut!

00:21.397 --> 00:22.774
That's the show, folks.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.276
Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.527
Joelle.

00:26.611 --> 00:27.486
Bradley.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.154
Little Sarah Lynn.

00:29.280 --> 00:33.910
And our star, BoJack Horseman!

00:33.993 --> 00:36.454
Thanks for coming out.
Thank you very much.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.038
-[laughing]
-Wow!

00:38.122 --> 00:38.957
Great pilot.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.585
We got the biggest laugh I ever heard
with that "gag me with a spoon" joke.

00:42.668 --> 00:45.630
And then we topped it
with the "get a room" joke.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.214
This was so fun.

00:47.298 --> 00:48.758
Do we get to make more?

00:48.841 --> 00:50.301
I think we got a real shot.

00:50.384 --> 00:54.096
And as long as the ratings don't dip
below a dismal 15 million a night,

00:54.179 --> 00:55.974
we could be on the air for many years.

00:56.056 --> 00:56.933
-No way!
-All right!

00:57.016 --> 00:58.392
-Your Squirt, sir.
-Thank you.

00:58.476 --> 01:00.979
And if that happens,
take care of each other.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.482
No matter what,
we're going to stick together.

01:07.986 --> 01:11.071
[unintelligible groans]

01:18.830 --> 01:21.874

02:12.842 --> 02:16.554
[unintelligible groans continue]

02:16.637 --> 02:19.765
Thank you, Tina,
for those touching grunts and growls.

02:19.849 --> 02:20.850
I'm Henry Winkler.

02:20.933 --> 02:24.395
You probably remember me
from my 2002 guest role

02:24.478 --> 02:26.772
on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.

02:26.856 --> 02:27.732
-Whoo!
-Thank you.

02:27.815 --> 02:31.318
But perhaps the greatest role
I've ever played is friend.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.071
Herb was a dear friend

02:33.153 --> 02:37.533
and I am honored to be dedicating
this bench in his memory.

02:39.118 --> 02:42.621
In his last days, Herb's cancer
had gone into remission.

02:42.705 --> 02:43.789
He was full of hope.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.251
But on the drive home from the hospital,
his brakes gave out,

02:47.334 --> 02:49.670
he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.

02:49.754 --> 02:53.007
He survived the crash,
but he was allergic to peanuts.

02:53.091 --> 02:54.258
He died instantly.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.261
Let us now read his final tweets.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.555
"I'm gonna live forever!

02:59.638 --> 03:01.015
Hashtag 'cancer free.'

03:01.099 --> 03:02.850
Hashtag 'invincible.'

03:02.934 --> 03:05.561
Hashtag 'tweeting while driving.'

03:05.644 --> 03:08.022
Oh, no, I think I'm gonna hit that truck.

03:08.106 --> 03:11.275
Hashtag 'hopefully it isn't full
of peanuts.'

03:11.358 --> 03:14.403
Hashtag 'Oh, no. It was full of peanuts.'"

03:15.446 --> 03:17.531
I was wondering
where you wandered off to.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.366
-Oh, shit. Hey.
-Hey.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.326
I'm no good with funerals.

03:21.410 --> 03:25.081
When I cry, it messes up my makeup
and then I get really bummed out.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.040
Yeah, same for me.

03:26.124 --> 03:28.292
Herb told me you came
by the house last summer.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.585
Yeah?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.379
Did he tell you anything else?

03:32.463 --> 03:35.466
No, we talked about cancer,
how hard it is living with cancer,

03:35.549 --> 03:37.676
about the L.A. Kings,
and then back to cancer.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.179
-Probably--
-Then I read that chapter in your book

03:40.262 --> 03:43.057
about how he never forgave you
and he tried to kick you out of the house

03:43.141 --> 03:45.768
and you ended up wrestling on the floor
over a telescope.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.437
-Oh, you did read that part?
-Yeah.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.649
I just wish
there was something I could do.

03:52.483 --> 03:53.525
Okay, I gotta go.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.527
Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.

03:55.611 --> 03:58.781
You wanna go grab a cup of vodka?
I-- I'm sorry, the funeral.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.282
I mean, a bottle of vodka?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.034
No. You should stick around.

04:02.118 --> 04:04.745
Hey, maybe you'll find
that something you're looking for.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.748
But if you're ever in New Mexico,
drop me a line.

04:07.832 --> 04:08.749
New Mexico?

04:08.833 --> 04:10.168
I thought you lived in Maine.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.543
I always pictured you there.

04:11.627 --> 04:12.795
A little house by a lake?

04:13.295 --> 04:15.798
I was just there for, like, a month,
30 years ago.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.466
-I live outside Santa Fe now.
-Oh.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.770
-[sighs] Think everyone here read my book?
-I didn't.

04:29.854 --> 04:30.938
Of course you didn't.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.232
Here's the CliffsNotes version:
Shut up, Todd!

04:33.315 --> 04:35.776
Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.

04:35.860 --> 04:39.697
I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk
of your car for the next few hours.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.281
Have fun being sad.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.076
Do you know what you're supposed to do
with our date pits?

04:44.160 --> 04:46.662
Why serve dates
and not have a place to put the pits?

04:46.745 --> 04:48.747
You know,
some people just have no class.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.499
What are you doing here?
You didn't know Herb.

04:50.582 --> 04:54.336
No, but I do know a hot ticket,
and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.881
Henry Winkler,
Jake and Maggot Gyllenhaal,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.758
that Pakistani girl
who keeps winning Nobel Prizes.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.343
I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.679
There's so much to hate
about what you just said.

05:03.762 --> 05:07.099
Good news. You know when someone dies,
everyone wants to buy their shit?

05:07.183 --> 05:08.976
You're lucky you have a piece
of Horsin' Around,

05:09.060 --> 05:11.145
because this is where money
starts rolling in.

05:11.229 --> 05:13.064
I don't want that. That's blood money.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.607
Well, what do you want me to do with it?
It's coming.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.484
I don't know. Give it to some orphans.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.528
-I can't deal with this.
-Oh, come on!

05:19.611 --> 05:22.781
You don't think Elton John
was raking it in when Diana died?

05:22.865 --> 05:26.827
More like "Candle in the Windfall."
Cha-ching! Hmm...

05:28.204 --> 05:32.583
[Herb] You have to live with the shitty
thing you did for the rest of your life.

05:33.625 --> 05:34.459
Huh.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.921
[British accent] Hello, love.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.257
Hey, Joelle,
I actually came here to be alone.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.550
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.803
I just flew in across the pond
and I don't know which end is up.

05:44.887 --> 05:48.933
This might be a stupid question,
but were you always so... British?

05:49.016 --> 05:52.186
Oh, let's get some light in here,
it's so dreadfully dreary.

05:52.270 --> 05:55.022
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure
you used to be American.

05:55.106 --> 05:55.981
That's better.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.859
Hey, this one's having a freak-out.
She needs to lie down.

05:58.943 --> 06:00.152
I'm not freaking out.

06:00.236 --> 06:02.988
I just don't understand
why that lady was being all judgy.

06:03.072 --> 06:06.700
You were touching her face
and telling her she was gonna die next.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.994
I'm eccentric. I do weird shit.

06:09.078 --> 06:11.038
How is that my problem?

06:11.122 --> 06:14.833
Hey, when was the last time
all four of us were in the same room?

06:14.917 --> 06:17.002
Probably not since the show ended.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.630
Yeah, I left California
pretty much right after.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.133
Now I got the biggest hardware store
in Seattle.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.468
That's a lie. We're actually in Olympia.

06:24.551 --> 06:28.388
And I'm on the West End
playing Juliet's... nurse.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.641
-And how are your kids?
-I don't have any kids.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.810
Oh, I just assumed
you had a bunch of kids,

06:32.893 --> 06:34.937
'cause, you know, your body.

06:35.020 --> 06:35.896
Come on, Sarah Lynn.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.023
I assumed
you weren't still a massive cunt.

06:38.107 --> 06:41.152
-Jesus Christ, Joelle.
-That's an okay thing to say in England.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.362
Shove it up your ass
with a spoonful of sugar,

06:43.445 --> 06:46.198
you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!

06:46.282 --> 06:48.200
-Guys, hey, hey, come on.
-Let go of me!

06:48.326 --> 06:51.245
-I'm gonna hulk out!
-Guys, can we just be civil for one day?

06:51.329 --> 06:53.497
-Oh, you're one to talk.
-What's that mean?

06:53.580 --> 06:56.041
Were you being civil
when you had sex with my mom?

06:56.125 --> 06:59.837
What? I never-- Why would--? Wait, which
one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.714
-No.
-This sucks. You guys suck.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.758
I don't even know
why I came to this party.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.969
It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.179
Herb died?

07:08.262 --> 07:11.473
You know, maybe it's for the best
we don't get together that often.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.600
We'd most likely drive each other mad.

07:13.684 --> 07:16.354
Well, no one knows how to get
under your skin like family.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.771
We're not a family, BoJack.

07:17.855 --> 07:21.233
We probably won't even see each other
again, until the next funeral.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.363
-Why are you all looking at me?
-You are the oldest.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.989
You are a severe alcoholic.

07:27.072 --> 07:30.409
I'm honestly so high right now,
I don't even know where I'm looking.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.537
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories,

07:33.620 --> 07:36.332
and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi--

07:36.415 --> 07:39.501
Pardon me. Is one of you Sarah Lynn?

07:39.584 --> 07:42.171
I am. Of course. God, are you blind?

07:42.254 --> 07:43.339
Yes.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.631
Well, forgive me.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.343
I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor.

07:47.426 --> 07:53.849
Per the instructions of his last will
and testament, I am to give you this disk.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.267
Am I close?

07:55.351 --> 07:57.061
Just take the disk from the guy.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.398
It contains directions to Herb's gold.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.648
Herb's gold?

08:01.732 --> 08:03.608
There were no further details.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.444
He was a peculiar client.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.988
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney,

08:08.072 --> 08:09.531
I'm just a blind man.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.701
Still, Herb thought me wise
for some reason.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.288
Perhaps it is my overly formal
manner of speech.

08:16.372 --> 08:19.417
I bid you good day.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.210
Oh, pardon me. Ow!

08:21.293 --> 08:22.669
Right at shin level.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.464
What are we supposed to do
with a floppy disk?

08:25.547 --> 08:26.465
Hmm...

08:26.548 --> 08:27.591
So, what's up, kiddo?

08:27.674 --> 08:30.344
BoJack and my mom
are becoming, like, friends

08:30.428 --> 08:31.887
and they're acting real weird.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.097
Oof! Uh...

08:33.179 --> 08:34.432
[rattling overhead]

08:34.514 --> 08:36.725
Hey, guys, guys, come on!

08:36.808 --> 08:38.394
There's somebody beneath you!

08:38.477 --> 08:39.895
Jeez, all day with the...

08:39.977 --> 08:41.645
Listen, kiddo, forget about them.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.858
You wanna check out
this cool new game I got?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.944
You have solitaire? On your computer?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.654
Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.

08:49.738 --> 08:50.697
Wow!

08:51.240 --> 08:53.242
Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.912
I bet it's still in his old office.
Unless somebody else moved in.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.789
Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember?

08:58.872 --> 09:02.709
Because it was under tap dancing star
Savion Glover's office. Let's go.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.003
-What? Right now?
-Yeah. Don't you get it?

09:05.087 --> 09:06.838
Herb's giving us a reunion special.

09:06.922 --> 09:10.468
Remember how he always wanted to do
a treasure hunt episode of Horsin' Around

09:10.550 --> 09:13.595
but the network said it was too edgy?
This is that episode.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.140
-I just don't know.
-Yeah, I don't want to do that.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.143
Wait, so you'd rather just stay
at this funeral and be sad,

09:19.226 --> 09:22.980
instead of going on a crazy adventure
to find our dead friend's secret treasure?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.982
Do you have any idea
how insane you sound?

09:25.065 --> 09:27.985
Oh, I get it.
You just don't wanna be here.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.194
No, that's not it.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.156
Herb clearly wanted us to do this,
as a family.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.491
Who cares what he wanted?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.326
He doesn't, because he's dead.

09:35.451 --> 09:37.411
And we all know he hated your guts.

09:37.495 --> 09:39.871
Yeah. He was my best friend
and he died hating me

09:39.955 --> 09:41.748
and nothing I do is gonna change that,

09:41.832 --> 09:44.876
but Herb left you that disk
because he wanted us to find his gold.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.964
If we can honor Herb's last wish,
then that's something.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.966
I don't know what, but it's something.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.220
-Okay. For Herb.
-Fine.

09:55.304 --> 09:58.098
-Shotgun!
-Everyone knows you can't call shotgun

09:58.182 --> 10:00.725
-before you see the car!
-My turn! Get out of my way!

10:00.809 --> 10:02.269
Brad, hang on one second.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.189
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.690
-No.
-Okay.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.984
Hi, Henry Winkler.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.446
I loved you in that one episode
of Law & Order: SVU.

10:12.530 --> 10:14.114
Oh, thank you.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.700
How would you like
to narrate a documentary for--

10:16.783 --> 10:18.702
Hey, listen, I am so flattered,

10:18.827 --> 10:22.247
but today is about Herb,
so let's respect that.

10:22.331 --> 10:24.542
Oh, God, I-- I'm so sorry.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.252
I'll let you get back to your business.

10:27.919 --> 10:32.466
Hey, Winkly, such a shame, isn't it?
About our friend Herb?

10:32.550 --> 10:34.259
It really burns my brisket

10:34.343 --> 10:37.471
that some people would turn a funeral
into some kind of schmoozefest.

10:37.555 --> 10:39.306
Yeah. I know.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.850
Those other people are the worst.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.102
I bet that woman barely knew Herb.

10:44.186 --> 10:45.812
Anyway, hi, I'm Henry.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.566
I used to volunteer with Herb
at Habitat For Humanity.

10:48.648 --> 10:52.486
Or as we like to call it,
Herbitat For Henranity. [laughs]

10:52.570 --> 10:55.697
We spent most of the day working
on that name,

10:55.780 --> 10:58.909
and only part of the day building,
but still, we helped some people.

10:59.034 --> 11:03.121
-How did you know Herb?
-We also volunteered at a, um...

11:03.622 --> 11:08.460
soup plantation-- Kitchen! Soup kitchen!
Whichever one is the good one.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.921
What? I never knew you did that.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.923
Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.843
Oh, hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, why don't you
talk about how you knew Herb?

11:16.927 --> 11:19.513
Oh, I never met the guy.
I'm just here to schmooze.

11:19.597 --> 11:23.100
Tell us about your thing, though,
it sounds fascinating.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.770
Everyone, gather round and listen
to Princess Carolyn's story.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.105
Okay.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.278
Wow, Herb kept all this old stuff.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.904
He sure did.

11:35.987 --> 11:39.575
Look, one of those answering machines
with tapes.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.869
Mr. Kazzaz, this is Manny from Pep Boys.

11:42.994 --> 11:45.705
We fixed the brakes on your car,
pick it up tomorrow.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.500
Just to reiterate,
your brakes are in great shape

11:48.584 --> 11:50.752
and shouldn't give you any more trouble.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.797
Unless, of course,
someone intentionally cut them,

11:53.880 --> 11:56.841
but why would anyone do that?
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.136
Probably because I'm such a big fan.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.180
Horsin' Around was a goddamn riot!

12:02.264 --> 12:04.475
I especially loved those kids.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.893
You know, wasn't so crazy
about the horse, though--

12:06.977 --> 12:09.187
Message deleted.

12:09.313 --> 12:10.855
Mm... How curious.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.233
How could you like Horsin' Around
but not the horse?

12:13.317 --> 12:15.486
That's like watching Castle
but hating castles.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.196
I mean, I've never seen it.
I assume it's about castles.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.239
-Wow!
-[all yell]

12:19.323 --> 12:22.993
Look at all these old 20th century relics.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.330
-How did you get here?
-I was in your trunk.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.083
Now I'm in outer space.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.085
Cut it out with your childish high jinks.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.795
Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.005
Whoa, can't I help?

12:35.088 --> 12:38.300
Here's 10 bucks. There's a Squirt machine
by the garage. Get five cans.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.969
You got it. I won't let you down.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.054
-[clattering, thumping]
-Oh, no!

12:43.138 --> 12:44.598
Your mom, was her name Karen?

12:44.682 --> 12:46.391
-Can we drop it?
-Something with a "K"?

12:46.475 --> 12:49.811
Her name is Nora. You know,
my parents got a divorce because of you.

12:49.894 --> 12:54.274
Nora? I don't know.
I banged so many chicks in the '80s.

12:55.317 --> 12:58.195
Okay, Todd, you can do this.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.363
Five Squirts.

12:59.446 --> 13:03.492
You just need to take this money
and put it in that machine.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.328
This-- Wait, what?
What happened to the $10?

13:06.411 --> 13:08.330
[grunting]

13:08.413 --> 13:11.249
No! Wind! Be cool!

13:11.333 --> 13:13.251
-Hey! That's mine!
-[screeching]

13:13.335 --> 13:15.879
-[screams]
-Oh...

13:15.962 --> 13:17.506
[screeches]
[thud]

13:17.589 --> 13:20.759
Why does this always happen to me?

13:23.220 --> 13:25.305
Looks like Herb set up a password.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.932
Oh, this is easy. Try "BoJack."

13:28.016 --> 13:30.769
-No. Didn't work.
-"BoJack-BFF"?

13:30.852 --> 13:33.063
"BoJack-I-Forgive-You"?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.272
Well, I'm out of ideas.

13:34.939 --> 13:35.940
Hmm...

13:37.192 --> 13:39.570
I'm just, like, so mad.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.571
Well, you should be.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.989
You're on the show
that fired Herb Kazzaz.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.867
What are the writers doing to my baby?
Are they killing it?

13:45.950 --> 13:49.246
Are they putting my baby into a car,
then driving the car into a lake?

13:49.371 --> 13:51.331
Topical! I still got it!

13:51.415 --> 13:53.958
They keep giving the best story lines
to Sarah Lynn.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.628
I haven't gotten
a single very special episode.

13:56.712 --> 13:59.297
When am I gonna learn
about drunk driving?

13:59.381 --> 14:02.300
Don't worry so much.
It's my legacy they're crapping all over.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.344
You're gonna come out
smelling like a daisy.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.430
You're too good for this TV stuff, anyway.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.807
You're a real actress,
you should be doing theater.

14:08.890 --> 14:09.808
Hold on.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.394
Hey, Joelle.
Wanna go to the mall this weekend?

14:12.477 --> 14:14.813
Don't you have any friends
your own age from school?

14:14.938 --> 14:18.483
No. My mom's boyfriend home-schools me.
He's a photographer.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.861
I'm going to the Lilith Fair this weekend
to support female solidarity.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.114
-So scram!
-Oh...

14:24.197 --> 14:27.284
Hey, be nicer to Sarah Lynn, will you?
She didn't choose this life.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.453
Remember this word: family.

14:29.578 --> 14:32.664
Okay? You two are family,
whether you like it or not,

14:32.748 --> 14:36.376
and that's the most important thing.
You listening? What's the most important?

14:36.460 --> 14:39.170
Family. It's family. I get it.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.840
I've got it! The password is...

14:42.800 --> 14:44.843
"password."

14:45.176 --> 14:46.094
It worked!

14:46.177 --> 14:47.471
Good thinking, Joelle.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.765
So in that memory,
were you British or American?

14:49.848 --> 14:51.975
The disk just has just one file on it,
it's--

14:52.058 --> 14:54.686
It's the address of a storage locker
in Van Nuys.

14:54.770 --> 14:56.938
A storage locker? Ugh!

14:57.021 --> 14:58.857
This treasure hunt sucks.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.317
[rattling overhead]

15:00.400 --> 15:04.362
At long last, can you keep down the noise,
keep down the funk?

15:04.446 --> 15:08.700
If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing,
it would have caught on by now!

15:12.912 --> 15:16.124
And when the mayor gave us the key
to the city,

15:16.207 --> 15:22.088
Herb said, "Volunteering isn't about keys.
It's about people."

15:22.172 --> 15:23.674
-How touching.
-Good story.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.301
-Who are you again?
-Wow, that was touching.

15:26.384 --> 15:27.969
A story that could never be topped.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.346
Or could it?

15:29.429 --> 15:33.266
Princess Carolyn, sing us another song
in the key of Kazzaz.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.226
You clearly knew the man so well.

15:35.310 --> 15:39.314
Please tell us another story
but with even more details.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.359
Yes. That's a great idea, Mr. Dog-Man.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.944
Tell us another story, Pink Cat Lady.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.697
Story, story!

15:46.780 --> 15:48.782
Come on, everybody.
What is this, a funeral?

15:48.866 --> 15:52.035
[all] Story, story, story!

15:52.452 --> 15:54.371
Well, you blew it again.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.122
You really are a dweeb.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.415
Don't say that.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.918
Whoa, who are you?

16:00.001 --> 16:02.253
Some kind of magical trash troll?

16:02.337 --> 16:03.797
No. I'm a janitor.

16:03.881 --> 16:06.466
But I was clearing out some
of the old stages,

16:06.550 --> 16:09.845
and I found this transformation chamber.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.555
Looks like a bunch of old junk.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.264
Let me tell you a story.

16:13.348 --> 16:18.061
Back in the '90s, the biggest dweeb
of them all was Steve Urkel.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.437
Oh, yeah.

16:19.521 --> 16:22.858
It was so funny how he never knew
whether or not he did that.

16:22.941 --> 16:26.862
Right.
Well, nerdy Steve Urkel invented a machine

16:26.945 --> 16:30.824
that transformed him
into the debonair Stefan Urquelle.

16:30.908 --> 16:34.994
Mr. Janitor, you're standing next
to a machine right now.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.455
Yes. That's why I brought it up.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.207
Now, this is just a prop.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.960
But it represents a very powerful idea.

16:42.043 --> 16:47.090
So if I go through that magic machine,
I'll become cool and confident?

16:47.173 --> 16:50.051
No, it's a-- It's a prop. I just said--

16:50.134 --> 16:53.513
[inhales, exhales deeply]

16:55.139 --> 16:58.101
-I feel different.
-Now, son--

16:58.184 --> 17:00.437
Todd? Who's Todd?

17:00.520 --> 17:03.481
My name's Toad. Toad Chavay.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.483
And I gotta get my bubble on.

17:05.567 --> 17:08.653
Machine? Squirt me. Hi-yah!

17:11.155 --> 17:12.574
That'll do, machine.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.455
Hmm...

17:20.457 --> 17:23.084
Look at all this
Horsin' Around fan correspondence

17:23.166 --> 17:25.044
Herb received in the post. Capital!

17:25.796 --> 17:26.713
Guys.

17:29.007 --> 17:29.841
[all gasp]

17:29.925 --> 17:32.385
Someone already got to Herb's gold.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.470
Oh, shit.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.180
There's a bunch of fur in here.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.390
It's bear fur.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.560
I can tell. My stepdad was a bear.

17:40.644 --> 17:44.063
Herb's nurse is a bear.
You think she knew about this gold?

17:44.147 --> 17:46.942
Hey, listen to this letter.
I think it might be a clue.

17:47.025 --> 17:50.403
Ahem. "Dear Herb,
just finished reading your novel.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.571
It's phenomenal.

17:51.655 --> 17:54.449
I'm jealous. I wish I wrote it.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.452
Sincerely, Henry Winkler,

17:57.535 --> 18:00.204
the guy from that one episode
of Law & Order: SVU."

18:00.330 --> 18:01.706
Herb wrote a novel?

18:01.790 --> 18:03.458
Oh...

18:04.167 --> 18:06.377
You look thin. Did you get into CrossFit?

18:06.461 --> 18:07.963
No, Sarah Lynn, I'm dying.

18:08.046 --> 18:11.549
Whatever it is, it is super slimming.
I am for totes jel over here.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.884
It's rectal cancer.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.928
Ew! Some of us are eating.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.973
Look, the reason I called you
is because I need a favor.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.891
Want me to leak a nude pic for charity?

18:19.975 --> 18:22.226
I want you to sober up.

18:22.310 --> 18:25.647
First of all, rude. Second, gross.
And third, why?

18:25.730 --> 18:29.567
I have a very important job for you,
but if you're zonked out all the time,

18:29.651 --> 18:32.320
I'm not sure I can trust you
with the responsibility.

18:32.403 --> 18:35.907
No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.

18:35.991 --> 18:36.908
[sniffing]

18:36.992 --> 18:38.618
I said tomorrow, right?

18:38.702 --> 18:41.997
I've been working on this novel.
I wanna be remembered for something.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.249
All I ever did was that stupid sitcom
that got ripped away from me.

18:45.333 --> 18:48.378
But now, with this book,
I have something good.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.922
I'm telling you, this book is gold.

18:51.006 --> 18:53.925
-It's my Kazzaz-terpiece.
-Whoa.

18:54.009 --> 18:57.971
I want you to make sure
it gets published after I die.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.723
You can count on me.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.141
To life, huh? It'll kill you.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.562
Oh, my God, the gold is his manuscript.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.565
Herb made me promise
to get it published after he died.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.608
And you're just remembering this now?

19:10.692 --> 19:14.237
Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.
The ketamine's wearing off.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.657
Oh, my God, you were the other kid
on Horsin' Around.

19:17.741 --> 19:20.535
That's why you've been following us
around all day.

19:20.618 --> 19:24.664
So no one's read this book
except for Henry Winkler

19:24.789 --> 19:28.251
-and now the book is missing?
-He must have been waiting for Herb to die

19:28.334 --> 19:30.837
so he could steal the book
and publish it himself.

19:30.921 --> 19:33.006
But then when the cancer went
into remission--

19:33.090 --> 19:33.965
Oh, my God.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.426
Guys, I don't think
that car crash was an accident.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.387
I think Herb might have been murdered!

19:39.470 --> 19:40.847
[gasping]

19:40.931 --> 19:41.890
[huffing]

19:41.973 --> 19:42.891
What's going on?

19:42.974 --> 19:44.851
Something about a merger?

19:48.563 --> 19:51.691
My name's Toad, baby.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.450
Yeah.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.327
Coolsville, daddy-o.

20:03.411 --> 20:06.623
Oh, lookie here.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.374
Yeah.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.543
Yo! That's my bike!

20:11.252 --> 20:13.964
Oops. Did I do that?

20:16.007 --> 20:21.972
Damn. I know I should be mad,
but that guy's just so cool.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.390
And when the river finally stopped,

20:24.474 --> 20:27.226
Herb went over
to a poor little Ottawan boy

20:27.310 --> 20:29.353
and he said, "Son, you have water now."

20:29.437 --> 20:32.857
You know, a lot of people go their
whole lives and they never give a damn.

20:32.941 --> 20:36.861
But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.321
That was beautiful.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.240
You clearly had a special relationship.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.326
We were gonna sprinkle Herb
over the ocean,

20:43.409 --> 20:46.663
but his resting place should be
someplace meaningful, don't you think?

20:46.788 --> 20:50.000
Why don't you take this up to Ottawa
and spread his ashes there.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.711
And make sure you take a video,
and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.

20:53.795 --> 20:56.047
So we can always remember
your great friendship.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.090
Everybody, stop!

20:57.174 --> 20:59.926
Henry Winkler is a stone-cold killer!

21:00.010 --> 21:01.427
[all gasp]

21:01.511 --> 21:02.887
What? I'm not a killer.

21:02.971 --> 21:06.474
Unless you mean killer of gloom,
because I bring joy everywhere I go.

21:06.557 --> 21:09.644
Did you mean "killer of gloom
because I bring joy everywhere I go"?

21:09.727 --> 21:11.229
You know that's not what I meant.

21:11.354 --> 21:14.024
You murdered Herb
so you could publish his book.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.610
But we're not gonna let you
steal his legacy, Henry Winkler.

21:17.694 --> 21:21.031
I was afraid this would happen.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.866
-Oh, no, he's got a gun!
-Oh, no!

21:22.949 --> 21:23.992
What?

21:26.619 --> 21:29.998
No, I have Herb's book.

21:30.123 --> 21:34.585
I didn't kill Herb,
but I did steal his manuscript.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.546
-So that I could burn it.
-What?

21:36.629 --> 21:38.840
Because it's terrible.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.175
Well, I'll see for myself.

21:40.258 --> 21:44.679
"The air in 1830s California was fragrant
with the flowers of laughter

21:44.762 --> 21:46.181
and the smoke of adventure."

21:46.264 --> 21:47.598
-What?
-Uh.

21:47.682 --> 21:52.436
After he died, Tina and I agreed
we couldn't let the book get published.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.190
It would have turned Herb
into a laughingstock.

21:55.273 --> 21:57.234
"The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.

21:57.316 --> 22:01.071
Hungry for crumpets.
But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life."

22:01.154 --> 22:02.989
He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."

22:03.073 --> 22:06.910
I know there's no accounting for taste,
but come on.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.078
[BoJack sighs]

22:08.161 --> 22:11.915
He's right. Herb wanted a legacy,
but he already has one.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.334
People loved Horsin' Around.
This would only ruin that.

22:15.418 --> 22:19.297
I'm sorry I accused you of murder,
American TV legend Henry Winkler.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.091
No need to apologize.

22:21.174 --> 22:24.177
You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death
to give it meaning.

22:24.261 --> 22:26.096
But there is no meaning in death.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.639
That's why it's so terrifying.

22:28.723 --> 22:31.726
It was just easier to believe
that you killed him for his book

22:31.809 --> 22:34.353
than believe that he just died
for nothing.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.981
There is no shame in dying for nothing.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.524
That's why most people die.

22:38.983 --> 22:42.070
I just wanted to fix things somehow.

22:42.153 --> 22:45.782
I'm sorry, Horse Guy, but you can't.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.747
Wow, heady stuff.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.291
But let's not get distracted

22:54.373 --> 22:57.294
from what a true friend
Princess Carolyn is.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.296
Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.048
Fantastic.

23:08.263 --> 23:10.473
Hey. Special delivery.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.309
Courtesy of the Toad-man.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.728
Thanks. Hey, why'd you roll up
your sleeves like that? You look weird.

23:15.812 --> 23:18.231
Oh, I-- [coughs]

23:18.315 --> 23:20.691
Well, you know, I was--
I was trying out a new look.

23:20.775 --> 23:23.027
It was-- It was a dumb idea.

23:23.111 --> 23:26.114
Yup. Whoa! Oh, no! Ow... Ow!

23:29.826 --> 23:31.661
-Here's your Squirt, sir.
-Thank you.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.872
And if that happens, I want you
to take care of each other.

23:34.998 --> 23:37.667
No matter what,
we're going to stick together.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.252
-Congratulations!
-Hey, good job.

23:39.336 --> 23:42.255
-You've got a goddamn hit on your hands.
-Anyone got coke?

23:42.339 --> 23:46.092
ABC sent us limousines
to take us to the wrap party.

23:46.176 --> 23:48.970
I'm scared. I've never been in a limo.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.681
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.851
-Seriously, no one has coke?
-Let's go.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.727
You don't wanna go to the party?

23:56.811 --> 23:57.812
Nah.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.190
Hey, we never got a chance
to walk around the lot.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.650
Wanna check out that water tank
where they filmed The Love Boat?

24:02.733 --> 24:07.071
Are you kidding? I've always wanted
to get tanked in a tank.

24:08.239 --> 24:09.699
-[laughing]
-Shh.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.993
-Quiet. Be careful.
-Oh, okay, okay.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.745
You ready?

24:15.997 --> 24:18.791
-What?
-What--? The water's only two inches deep.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.668
Well, that's Hollywood for you.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.547
Hey.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.633
Are you scared at all?

24:27.717 --> 24:31.054
That if the show takes off,
everything's going to change?

24:31.137 --> 24:35.016
[laughs] No, I'm not scared, BJ.
The future is bright.
