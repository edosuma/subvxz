02:47.375 --> 02:48.961

02:49.003 --> 02:51.046
Well, Mrs. Plankin said

02:49.003 --> 02:51.046
that they won't socialize

02:51.088 --> 02:52.171
with other kids

02:51.088 --> 02:52.171

Come on,

03:02.349 --> 03:03.934
this is serious.

Now, Mrs. Plankin

03:03.976 --> 03:05.477
suggested

03:05.519 --> 03:08.981
that we join a

03:12.901 --> 03:16.530

03:16.571 --> 03:17.781
and she wrote a book

07:11.472 --> 07:13.767
which one's Mohammed?

07:13.808 --> 07:16.395
No-No, what-what

07:13.808 --> 07:16.395
I'm saying is

07:16.436 --> 07:18.730
if the boys won't

07:16.436 --> 07:18.730
go to the group

07:18.772 --> 07:20.732
bring the group

07:18.772 --> 07:20.732
to the boys, you know?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.902
Oh, oh, yeah.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.902
Well, I-I knew that.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.863
So-So, so, no kid's named

07:23.944 --> 07:26.863
Mohammed, right, I just wanna..

07:28.240 --> 07:29.908
Alright, let's go, group!

07:29.950 --> 07:32.493
Come on, I've got a couple of

07:29.950 --> 07:32.493
lads for you to meet over there.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.829
Let's go.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.829
I'll be a pumped-up goose.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.874
Go on. Bring your

07:34.871 --> 07:37.874
<i>sheleighleigh</i> over there.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.543
See that boys? The kids came

07:37.916 --> 07:40.543
over to play with you!

07:40.585 --> 07:42.545
See you later, daddy.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.592
Guys, where're

07:46.007 --> 07:47.592
you going?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.761
You're supposed to be playing

07:47.634 --> 07:49.761
with the other kids.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.554
Alright, gang. You know what?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.554
They-They'll be right back.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.014
They're really

07:51.596 --> 07:53.014
a lot of fun.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.266
In fact, they're

07:53.056 --> 07:54.266
party animals, these kids.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.850
Now, go play

07:54.308 --> 07:55.850
with Uncle Jo-Jo.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.352
Come on, let's go.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.899
This playgroup is boring!

08:04.025 --> 08:06.820
Hey, cut me some slack.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.655
I run a pretty

08:06.861 --> 08:08.655
good playgroup.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.407
You don't

08:08.696 --> 08:10.407
have a clue.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.871
Oh, playgroup critic,

08:14.535 --> 08:16.871
huh?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.915
Alright, uh, what's your name?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.915
What do they call you?

08:18.957 --> 08:21.251
- What's your moniker, kid?

08:18.957 --> 08:21.251
- Linus Plankin.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.753
Yeah, Plankin.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.756
I heard your mom

08:23.795 --> 08:26.756
lost the Pulitzer.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.716
At least

08:26.798 --> 08:28.716
she got nominated.

08:30.718 --> 08:31.886
Wow, good one!

08:31.928 --> 08:34.139
Uh, nailed

08:31.928 --> 08:34.139
by an ankle-biter, eh?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.974
Get over there

08:34.181 --> 08:35.974
and watch the kids, huh?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.643
I'm dead!

08:36.850 --> 08:38.643
My life is over.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.561
Oh, come on, DJ,

08:38.685 --> 08:40.561
it's not that bad.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.064
Not that bad?

08:40.603 --> 08:43.064
I got a ticket.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.692
My dad's never gonna let me

08:43.106 --> 08:45.692
drive his car again!

08:45.733 --> 08:47.610
I can't believe

08:45.733 --> 08:47.610
I'm a pedestrian.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.530
Deej, this isn't

08:47.652 --> 08:50.530
about religion.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.991
You're gonna

08:50.571 --> 08:52.991
be walking.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.409
You know, Kimmy,

08:53.033 --> 08:54.409
this is all your fault.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.829
Hey, I was

08:54.451 --> 08:57.829
airing out my socks.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.331
Who knew that hanging

08:57.871 --> 08:59.331
your feet out the window

08:59.373 --> 09:00.748
was illegal

08:59.373 --> 09:00.748
in this state?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.669
Well, this ticket says

09:02.125 --> 09:04.669
you're obstructing my view.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.046
Wait, I thought you

09:04.711 --> 09:06.046
got it 'cause her feet

09:06.087 --> 09:08.006
didn't meet current

09:06.087 --> 09:08.006
pollution standards.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.426
Deej, it's

09:09.924 --> 09:11.426
your dad's car.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.927
You've gotta do

09:11.468 --> 09:12.927
the right thing

09:12.969 --> 09:14.595
pay the ticket

09:12.969 --> 09:14.595
and don't tell him.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.518
Well, I guess what he doesn't

09:17.432 --> 09:19.518
know can't hurt him.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.520
That's why nana

09:19.559 --> 09:21.520
waits till grandpa's asleep

09:21.561 --> 09:23.063
before she trims

09:21.561 --> 09:23.063
his ear hair.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.691
Uh, I gotta

09:25.273 --> 09:26.691
go now, Deej.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.278
- Alright, um, good luck.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.278
- Oh, and, Kimmy?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.321
Listen, next time

09:30.320 --> 09:31.321
you decide to stick

09:31.363 --> 09:32.739
your feet out

09:31.363 --> 09:32.739
the car-window

09:32.780 --> 09:34.574
make sure we're going

09:32.780 --> 09:34.574
through, like a car wash.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.202
(Kimmy)

09:35.992 --> 09:37.202
'Bye-bye, Deej.'

09:43.083 --> 09:45.085
Hi, Deej.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.421
How long have

09:45.126 --> 09:47.421
you guys been here?

09:47.462 --> 09:49.797
Seven years.

I don't mean,

09:49.839 --> 09:52.551
on the planet, Michelle.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.553
How much

09:52.592 --> 09:54.553

09:54.594 --> 09:55.636
Hmm..

09:55.678 --> 09:57.722
Just enough

09:55.678 --> 09:57.722
to<i> ruin</i> your life.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.560
Look, you two,

09:58.932 --> 10:01.560
not a<i> word</i> to dad.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.852
You mean..

10:02.894 --> 10:05.313
...you want us to keep

10:02.894 --> 10:05.313
something from father?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.066
We couldn't.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.404
Okay, what do

10:10.193 --> 10:12.404
you guys want?

10:12.446 --> 10:14.072
Well, for starters

10:14.114 --> 10:16.491
how about taking a little tour

10:14.114 --> 10:16.491
of your closet?

10:18.493 --> 10:21.246
Okay, you little rats

10:18.493 --> 10:21.246
can borrow my clothes.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.705
That's just

10:21.288 --> 10:22.705
the beginning.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.292

10:22.747 --> 10:25.292

13:19.006 --> 13:20.592

13:20.634 --> 13:23.470
is a major

13:20.634 --> 13:23.470
breakthrough for me.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.513
You're not gonna tell them

about our problem, are you?

of their business.

a red aura here.

here is green

open to change

13:40.903 --> 13:43.573
but your energy

13:40.903 --> 13:43.573
is red..."stop."

13:43.615 --> 13:45.866
"Go no further."

13:45.908 --> 13:49.454
Your feelings can't get

13:45.908 --> 13:49.454
through the intersection.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.915
What is this,

13:51.205 --> 13:52.915
traffic school?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.834
Okay, why don't I tell

13:54.334 --> 13:55.834
everyone about our problem--

13:55.876 --> 13:58.797
Becky, Becky,

13:55.876 --> 13:58.797
Becky, please.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.089
I'm sure there are

13:58.837 --> 14:00.089
people here

14:00.131 --> 14:01.966
with problems far more

14:00.131 --> 14:01.966
serious than ours.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.304
Uh, not that we have

14:03.176 --> 14:06.304
a problem, per se.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.846
It's just..

14:07.888 --> 14:09.098
Well, look at this guy.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.272
Now, here's a guy

14:13.561 --> 14:16.272
with problems.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.607
Spill it, man,

14:16.314 --> 14:17.607
uh, uh.

14:17.649 --> 14:18.692
Go through

14:17.649 --> 14:18.692
the intersection.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.777
Let it out.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.903
Thank you.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.032
Yesterday, our

14:22.945 --> 14:26.032
15-year-old twins

14:26.073 --> 14:28.201
Phil and Phyl..

14:30.578 --> 14:31.954
...spelled differently.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.791
They cut school, went down

14:31.996 --> 14:34.791
to Fisherman's Wharf

14:34.833 --> 14:36.083
put on lobster suits

14:36.125 --> 14:38.378
and started pinching

14:36.125 --> 14:38.378
all the tourists.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.425
Lobster suits.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.386
Now, this guy's

14:44.467 --> 14:46.386
got problems.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.887
We're there

14:46.427 --> 14:47.887
for you, man.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.263
Thank you.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.184
When did you first notice

14:50.765 --> 14:53.184
something wrong?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.395
Uh, when they

14:53.226 --> 14:55.395
were about, uh, three.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.189
Yes, uh, they wouldn't play

14:55.436 --> 14:58.189
with any of the other kids.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.734
They were always off

14:58.231 --> 15:00.734
by themselves.

15:00.775 --> 15:04.362
'Boy, I wish we had had a group

15:00.775 --> 15:04.362
like this back then.'

15:04.404 --> 15:05.613
Maybe today, my Phils

15:05.655 --> 15:09.116
wouldn't be dressed up

15:05.655 --> 15:09.116
like crustaceans.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.661
Uh, uh, hold on a second.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.661
You know, back up li'l bit.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.162
Now, you said

15:11.703 --> 15:13.162
when they were three

15:13.204 --> 15:14.664
they-they wouldn't play

15:13.204 --> 15:14.664
with anyone else?

15:14.706 --> 15:16.290
That's right.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.290
We tried everything.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.127
We, we took them to all

15:16.332 --> 15:20.127
the playgroups.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.962
We even tried to bribe

15:20.169 --> 15:21.962
them with candy

15:22.004 --> 15:23.548
worst thing

15:22.004 --> 15:23.548
we could have done.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.343
The more we

15:26.008 --> 15:27.343
pushed them

15:27.385 --> 15:30.054
the more they clung

15:27.385 --> 15:30.054
to each other.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.681
Well, this is,

15:30.096 --> 15:31.681
this is terrible.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.266
You-You gotta do

15:31.723 --> 15:33.266
something, Seth.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.976
Uh, say something.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.976
Help us. Help him.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.395
<i>Help him?</i>

15:38.938 --> 15:40.940
Alright, green light,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.940
green light, green light.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.567
Help me.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.402
It's too late for him.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.402
His kids are lobsters.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.028
Hey..

15:46.070 --> 15:47.113
...no offense, man.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.573
- None taken.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.573
- Okay.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.285
Look, you see,

15:49.990 --> 15:52.285
what Jesse means is-is..

15:52.326 --> 15:55.663
...well, we're having the same

15:52.326 --> 15:55.663
problem with our twins.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.499
Well, I mean,

15:55.705 --> 15:58.499
they're not lobsters yet.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.377
They're more like

15:58.541 --> 16:01.377
little hermit crabs.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.838
But the point is,

16:01.419 --> 16:03.838
they don't like socializing

16:03.880 --> 16:05.590
with anyone

16:03.880 --> 16:05.590
but each other.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.884
This is a very common

16:05.632 --> 16:07.884
problem for twins.

16:07.926 --> 16:11.095
On the one hand, they always

16:07.926 --> 16:11.095
have someone to play with

16:11.137 --> 16:13.473
so, there's no pressure

16:11.137 --> 16:13.473
to socialize

16:13.514 --> 16:15.349
but, on the other hand

16:15.391 --> 16:17.685
it's good to give them

16:15.391 --> 16:17.685
individual attention

16:17.727 --> 16:19.353
interests

16:19.395 --> 16:20.688
names.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.232
Told you, Phil.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.567
Shut up, Phyllis.

16:27.111 --> 16:30.907
Your twins don't have to do

16:27.111 --> 16:30.907
<i>everything together.</i>

16:30.949 --> 16:32.867
If one of them

16:30.949 --> 16:32.867
likes science

16:32.909 --> 16:34.410
and one of them

16:32.909 --> 16:34.410
likes music

16:34.452 --> 16:37.664
take one to the museum

16:34.452 --> 16:37.664
and one to see..."Cats".

16:37.705 --> 16:40.124
Hmm, yeah. Yeah, I-I see

16:37.705 --> 16:40.124
what you're saying.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.251
So, so, let them go out

16:40.166 --> 16:42.251
and do their own thing.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.337
In that way, you know, then

16:42.293 --> 16:44.337
maybe they'll meet other kids

16:44.378 --> 16:45.713
that like to do

16:44.378 --> 16:45.713
what they like to do.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.966
Very insightful, Jesse.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.383
Yes, very good, Jesse.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.885
Thank you.

16:52.470 --> 16:53.888
Yeah, well, uh..

16:53.930 --> 16:57.391
...insight's always been

16:53.930 --> 16:57.391
a, uh, forte of mine.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.560
We have a little

16:57.433 --> 16:59.560
tradition here

16:59.602 --> 17:01.228
when someone has

16:59.602 --> 17:01.228
a breakthrough.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.105
Oh, yes, huh?

17:01.270 --> 17:03.105
Check this out.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.858
My first night,

17:03.147 --> 17:04.858
I'm already getting an award.

17:06.651 --> 17:07.902
- Jess?

17:06.651 --> 17:07.902
- Yes?

17:07.944 --> 17:11.071
You get to wear

17:07.944 --> 17:11.071
the green-aura fedora.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.700
- 'Oh.'

17:11.113 --> 17:13.700
- 'Yes!'

17:26.963 --> 17:29.674
- Steph, that's my new blouse!

17:26.963 --> 17:29.674
- I know.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.176
Don't you think the color

17:29.716 --> 17:32.176
brings out my eyes?

17:33.260 --> 17:35.054
Oh, I'll bring out

17:33.260 --> 17:35.054
your eyes.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.723
And I'll bring out

17:35.095 --> 17:36.723
your ticket

17:36.764 --> 17:38.683
which will bring out

17:36.764 --> 17:38.683
that vein in dad's head

17:38.725 --> 17:40.184
when he starts screaming.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.063
[humming]

17:44.104 --> 17:46.024
Michelle, why are you

17:44.104 --> 17:46.024
wearing my sweater?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.358
'Cause I can.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.446
That's it. You guys are

17:49.736 --> 17:52.446
taking this way too far.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.115
Fine, why don't you

17:52.488 --> 17:55.115
tell dad?

17:55.157 --> 17:57.410
Tell dad what?

17:57.451 --> 18:00.955
Tell dad how great

17:57.451 --> 18:00.955
the girls...look in my clothes.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.665
Oh, yeah.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.378
You know what would look

18:04.834 --> 18:07.378
great with this blouse?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.255
A new pair of socks.

18:09.296 --> 18:10.882
New socks?

18:10.924 --> 18:13.760
I think new socks

18:10.924 --> 18:13.760
would be just the ticket.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.596
Fine.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.473
I want you guys to get

18:16.637 --> 18:19.473
everything you deserve.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.141
This is just wonderful

18:21.183 --> 18:23.269
to see my daughters getting

18:21.183 --> 18:23.269
along with each other like this

18:23.310 --> 18:25.271
showing each other

18:23.310 --> 18:25.271
love and respect.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.814
Wow, it's nice to see

18:25.312 --> 18:26.814
that my dad-talk

18:26.856 --> 18:28.691
the other morning,

18:26.856 --> 18:28.691
had this much impact on you.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.988
My dad-talks never

18:30.777 --> 18:33.988
have this much impact on you.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.740
What's going on

18:34.030 --> 18:35.740
in here?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.992
- Nothing.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.619
Nothing?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.245
Hmm.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.248
You know, when-when sisters say

18:41.287 --> 18:44.248
there's nothing going on

18:44.290 --> 18:47.043
it usually means

18:44.290 --> 18:47.043
that they're hiding something.

18:47.085 --> 18:51.005
Now, DJ has been acting

18:47.085 --> 18:51.005
extra generous lately.

18:51.422 --> 18:52.506
Why?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.261
And Stephanie and Michelle

18:57.303 --> 18:59.388
they've been acting

18:57.303 --> 18:59.388
extra greedy lately.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.599
Why?

19:04.268 --> 19:07.354
You know,

19:04.268 --> 19:07.354
it can only mean one thing.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.440
I did it.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.568
I used her toothbrush

19:09.482 --> 19:12.568
to brush Comet's teeth.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.160
Okay, it can only

19:18.783 --> 19:21.160
mean two things.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.829
But we're gonna talk

19:21.201 --> 19:22.829
about that one later.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.040
Dad, call off

19:24.038 --> 19:26.040
the investigation.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.959
I got a ticket.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.838
Now, it wasn't

19:29.460 --> 19:31.838
a speeding ticket or anything.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.464
Kimmy was airing out

19:31.879 --> 19:33.464
her socks

19:33.506 --> 19:35.424
and her feet

19:33.506 --> 19:35.424
obstructed my vision.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.345
You know, I thought the car

19:36.717 --> 19:39.345
smelled funny.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.180
I thought you just hit

19:39.386 --> 19:41.180
a muskrat or something.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.976
DJ, why didn't

19:42.890 --> 19:44.976
you tell me?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.352
I'm sorry, dad.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.021
I, I was afraid that you

19:46.393 --> 19:48.021
would get mad at me

19:48.062 --> 19:49.605
and never let me

19:48.062 --> 19:49.605
use your car again.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.858
Hmm.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.776
I don't suppose somebody

19:51.899 --> 19:53.776
found out about all this

19:53.818 --> 19:55.277
and, uh, used this information

19:55.319 --> 19:57.237
to enhance

19:55.319 --> 19:57.237
their own wardrobe?

19:59.406 --> 20:02.451
That's you,

19:59.406 --> 20:02.451
right, Steph?

20:02.493 --> 20:05.163
That's both of us.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.539
I'm sorry, Deej.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.166
Me too.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.417
Okay, I'll tell you how we're

20:08.207 --> 20:10.417
going to deal with this

20:10.459 --> 20:12.586
for the next two weekends,

20:10.459 --> 20:12.586
alright

20:12.628 --> 20:14.881
DJ, the only time

20:12.628 --> 20:14.881
you can use my car

20:14.922 --> 20:16.090
is to take Michelle

20:14.922 --> 20:16.090
and Stephanie

20:16.132 --> 20:17.967
anywhere they want to go.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.259
Dad, that's not fair.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.846
I think it's

20:19.301 --> 20:21.846
extremely fair.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.057
Then, you, you're gonna just

20:21.888 --> 20:24.057
love this part then.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.516
For the next two weekends

20:25.558 --> 20:27.685
Steph, you and Michelle

20:25.558 --> 20:27.685
are grounded.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.233
Grounded?

20:34.274 --> 20:36.903
But then, DJ can't

20:34.274 --> 20:36.903
take us anyplace.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.114
You see,

20:38.404 --> 20:40.114
that's the fair part.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.705
What does elephant say?

20:47.747 --> 20:50.041
- He's chasing him.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.041
- He's chasing him?

20:50.083 --> 20:51.709
- Hey, guys.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.709
- 'Hi.'

20:51.751 --> 20:54.003
- How was the zoo?

20:51.751 --> 20:54.003
- Oh, it was great.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.005
Nicky really loves animals

20:54.045 --> 20:56.005
and you know what?

20:56.047 --> 20:57.464
He made a new friend

20:56.047 --> 20:57.464
named Stuart.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.925
- Oh, yeah.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.925
- Yeah, Nick?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.927
Tell daddy

20:58.966 --> 21:00.927
what Stuart said.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.302
"Camels stink."

21:04.430 --> 21:07.558
I don't want him hanging

21:04.430 --> 21:07.558
around Stuart anymore.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.851
How was the park?

21:08.893 --> 21:10.144
Oh, it was a blast.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.771
He played with a bunch

21:10.186 --> 21:11.771
of little Baby Ruths.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.065
Tell mommy, tell mommy

21:11.812 --> 21:14.065
what you hit.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.566
Daddy's head.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.694
Yeah. It felt like

21:15.608 --> 21:18.694
a home run, too.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.571
Alright, you guys

21:18.736 --> 21:20.571
had fun today.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.782
You did your separate things.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.782
You made some new friends.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.408
Now, go ahead

21:22.823 --> 21:24.408
and go get reacquainted.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.202
Let's go, brother.

21:26.244 --> 21:27.578
Okay.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.293
Well, honey,

21:31.624 --> 21:34.293
you've got to admit

21:34.334 --> 21:36.796
that support group had

21:34.334 --> 21:36.796
some pretty good ideas.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.505
Well, except

21:36.837 --> 21:38.505
for the hat.

21:38.547 --> 21:42.593
Yeah, well, I-I will say this

21:38.547 --> 21:42.593
one thing, they do validate you.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.220
Ooh, validate.

21:44.262 --> 21:47.306
Jess, you're really getting

21:44.262 --> 21:47.306
into the psychology lingo.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.474
I meant the parking.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.811
You're right, Beck,

21:50.350 --> 21:51.811
it was good, it was good

21:51.852 --> 21:53.353
we went to the group.

21:53.395 --> 21:57.191
And the truth is that, uh,

21:53.395 --> 21:57.191
I think they really helped us.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.359
Honey, just clear

21:57.233 --> 21:59.359
something up for me.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.987
If you knew

21:59.401 --> 22:00.987
that we had a problem

22:01.028 --> 22:02.905
why did you have

22:01.028 --> 22:02.905
such a hard time admitting it?

22:05.532 --> 22:06.533
I don't know, Beck.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.535
Maybe I was..

22:08.577 --> 22:10.997
...maybe I was afraid of what

22:08.577 --> 22:10.997
I might find out, that's all.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.915
Like what?

22:12.957 --> 22:14.708
Eh, like I'm doing

22:12.957 --> 22:14.708
something wrong

22:14.750 --> 22:16.335
like this whole thing

22:14.750 --> 22:16.335
is my fault

22:16.376 --> 22:17.586
like I'm messing up

22:16.376 --> 22:17.586
my kid's life.

22:17.628 --> 22:18.712
I just..

22:19.964 --> 22:22.300
Well, I guess I just didn't

22:19.964 --> 22:22.300
want to face it.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.760
Oh, sweetie.

22:24.802 --> 22:26.929
Everybody makes mistakes.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.431
I mean, no parent

22:26.971 --> 22:29.431
is perfect

22:29.473 --> 22:31.309
but if you deny

22:29.473 --> 22:31.309
that you have a problem

22:31.349 --> 22:33.060
and you don't ask

22:31.349 --> 22:33.060
for help

22:33.102 --> 22:34.770
well, the next thing

22:33.102 --> 22:34.770
you know

22:34.812 --> 22:36.438
your kids are dressing up

22:34.812 --> 22:36.438
in lobster suits.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.857
Hmm.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.983
Well, let me

22:37.898 --> 22:38.983
tell you something

22:39.025 --> 22:40.860
I learned something

22:39.025 --> 22:40.860
<i>very valuable.</i>

22:40.901 --> 22:42.153
Now on, if I need help

22:42.195 --> 22:43.654
I'm not gonna be afraid

22:42.195 --> 22:43.654
to ask for it.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.448
You know..

22:46.490 --> 22:48.659
...you're kind of sexy

22:46.490 --> 22:48.659
when you're vulnerable.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.289
Help,

22:51.662 --> 22:53.289
my lips.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.707
Help. Help.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.083
- Hm-hmm.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.083
- Yeah, right here?

22:56.125 --> 22:57.918
Yeah, it's a...have

22:56.125 --> 22:57.918
a little, here, pain.

23:01.339 --> 23:02.965
As to which,

23:01.339 --> 23:02.965
I must say..

23:03.007 --> 23:04.091
...have mercy.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.768
