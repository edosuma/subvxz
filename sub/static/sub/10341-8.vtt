WEBVTT

02:58.303 --> 02:59.386
- Hey, Donna.
- Hi.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.930
- James, come on in.
- Hi.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.391
We just came
to say goodbye to Maddy.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.935
Oh, I'm sorry, you just missed her.

03:07.478 --> 03:10.689
In fact, I dropped her off
at the bus station not 20 minutes ago.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.441
- She's gone?
- Yes.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.652
She thought that you were coming
over last night.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.615
Um, did she say anything?

03:20.158 --> 03:23.327
Well, I would have to say that
she was a little bit disappointed.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.163
Leland?

03:26.414 --> 03:28.373
Leland, honey?

03:28.583 --> 03:30.042
Excuse me.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.685
You know, if you'd like,
you could write her.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.230
I'm sure she'd be glad
to hear from you.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.149
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry
we bothered you.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.276
Hey, no bother, no bother.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.528
- Say hi to your folks for me, Donna.
- Okay.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.113
- Okay.
- Goodbye, Mr. Palmer.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.282
Bye, James.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.661
- Take it easy now.
- All right.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.675
- Leland?
- Yes, dear.

04:19.884 --> 04:23.595
Remember to sign us up for
the Glenn Miller Night at the club.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.181
Don't worry, dear, I won't forget.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.295
- Bye, hon.
- Bye, Leland.

05:39.630 --> 05:43.633
It smells like a toilet in here.
There's nothing...

05:46.846 --> 05:50.015
Jerry, what the hell
took you so long?

05:50.183 --> 05:56.229
Ah, gee, datelines, time zones,
I don't even know where I am.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.650
God, you look terrible.

06:06.657 --> 06:09.201
- Jerry.
- Ben.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.624
Well, Ben,
since your regular mouthpiece

06:15.792 --> 06:18.460
has been charged
with murder himself,

06:18.669 --> 06:23.215
I'm gonna be handling your case
personally. So let's get started.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.802
Did you kill her?

06:27.303 --> 06:31.681
- Jerry, for God's sakes.
- Sorry, you're right.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.852
The last thing a good defense attorney
needs to know is the truth.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.650
Jerry, can you get me out of here?

06:41.818 --> 06:45.237
Well, they can only hold you
for 24 hours without charging you.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.530
Or is it 48?

06:47.240 --> 06:52.619
Oh, Jerry, Jerry,
I am in trouble here.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.539
Under control, big brother.

06:55.748 --> 07:00.335
Okay, so where are we saying
you were on the night Laura died?

07:02.463 --> 07:05.966
- I was with Catherine.
- That's not a good choice.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.385
It happens to be the truth.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.512
Oh, dear.

07:10.680 --> 07:15.684
Is there any sign of her?
Bone... Bone fragments or teeth?

07:16.477 --> 07:21.022
Charred corroborating note
regarding your whereabouts?

07:26.988 --> 07:29.239
I'm so depressed.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.253
Bunk beds.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.843
Do you remember
our first room, Ben?

07:50.261 --> 07:54.264
Me on the top bunk
and you on the bottom bunk.

07:54.724 --> 08:00.312
And Louise Dombrowski dancing
on the hook rug with a flashlight.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.932
Lord, what's become of us?

09:23.187 --> 09:26.147
You know, the first time I went in,

09:26.315 --> 09:30.068
they thought it was my bladder,
so they checked it again.

09:30.278 --> 09:34.239
It was an infection.
I hadn't even been near a rusty nail.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.200
I mean, you remember that time
my toe turned purple, right?

09:37.368 --> 09:41.079
So instead, I took a bath in baking
soda and then my toe came around,

09:41.289 --> 09:42.581
but I got the worst cramps

09:42.748 --> 09:44.791
like I swallowed
a kinked hose or something.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.293
Have you seen Andy?

09:46.460 --> 09:49.087
Oh, you must be that native person

09:49.255 --> 09:53.008
I've heard so much about,
um, Eagle Eye?

09:53.217 --> 09:56.136
Hawk. Sister?

09:56.304 --> 09:58.722
Oh, yeah, this is my sister Gwen.
This is Hawk.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.974
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.

10:01.183 --> 10:05.478
God, how you must hate us white
people after all we've done to you.

10:05.688 --> 10:06.896
Some of my best friends

10:07.064 --> 10:08.648
- are white people.
- Oh.

10:10.359 --> 10:14.279
Anyway, oh, come on.
My stomach...

10:14.488 --> 10:17.657
Diane, 10:03 a.m.,
Great Northern Hotel.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.869
Sheriff Truman and I have just been
with the one-armed man,

10:21.078 --> 10:22.787
or what's left of him.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.581
In another time, another culture,

10:24.749 --> 10:27.334
he may have been
a seer, a shaman priest.

10:27.543 --> 10:30.920
In our world, he's a shoe salesman
and lives among the shadows.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.688
Leland Palmer.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.279
- Whoops! Excuse me.
- Whoa!

10:58.574 --> 11:01.076
Does he know
we arrested Ben Horne?

11:01.577 --> 11:03.620
Doesn't look like it.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.623
Harry, best if he'd hear it from you.

11:15.591 --> 11:19.094
Hi, Harry, Agent Cooper. Heh.
Just having a little fun.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.513
You're looking good, Leland.

11:21.722 --> 11:24.641
Just call me Fred. Ha-ha-ha.

11:25.935 --> 11:29.187
Leland, I'm sorry.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.440
We didn't want you
to hear it from anyone else.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.694
We've arrested Ben Horne
for Laura's murder.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.570
- Huh?
- He hasn't been charged,

11:37.738 --> 11:39.531
but we're holding him.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.034
- Ben? Ha, ha.
- That's right.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.745
There must be
some mistake, Harry.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.622
Ben?

11:48.582 --> 11:51.876
- I thought that Jacques Renault had...
- No.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.630
Ben.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.717
- You have a strong case against him?
- Yes, we do.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.885
Oh, God.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.722
- Will you be all right, Leland?
- Oh.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.976
Yeah.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.731
- The law will handle this.
- As it should be.

12:13.983 --> 12:18.194
Thanks, Harry. Agent Cooper.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.682
Harry, I'll catch up with you.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.704
Leland?

13:09.872 --> 13:11.956
Ahem. Yes.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.836
If you can remember anything unusual
about Mr. Horne's behavior

13:17.004 --> 13:20.089
the night of Laura's death,
would you please let me know?

13:20.382 --> 13:23.301
I will, of course.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.180
Thank you.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.365
Everything okay?

13:45.533 --> 13:47.367
I'm not sure.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.611
This won't hurt a bit.

14:24.113 --> 14:28.449
Sheriff, I protest this brutal treatment
of my client.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.202
After all this man
has done for this town...

14:31.412 --> 14:33.288
- Now, hold still.
- Ow!

14:41.589 --> 14:44.048
I'll have the results
in a couple of hours.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.342
- Thanks, doc.
- Gentlemen,

14:46.552 --> 14:50.096
I demand that my client
either be released or charged.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.933
Never in all my years of practicing law
have I witnessed such a complete

14:54.143 --> 14:59.063
and utter disregard for
an accused man's constitutional rights.

14:59.273 --> 15:03.026
Jeremy Horne,
Gonzaga University, 1974.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.321
Graduated last in his class of 142.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.448
Passed the bar on his third attempt.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.742
License to practice
revoked in the states

15:10.951 --> 15:13.786
of Illinois, Florida,
Alaska, Massachusetts.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.707
Hey, I'm not on trial here.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.417
Sit down.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.047
Mr. Horne, do you know what this is?

15:25.549 --> 15:27.550
- A book.
- A book.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.636
Take a closer look.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.604
A diary.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.273
We all know about One-Eyed Jack's.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.901
So did Laura.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.990
"Someday, I'm gonna tell the world
all about Ben Horne.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.743
I'm gonna tell them who he really is."

15:55.955 --> 15:58.122
She never got the chance, did she?

16:02.795 --> 16:07.590
Come on, Ben, we're all adults here.

16:08.092 --> 16:13.471
Wild, young girl like Laura Palmer,
things spin out of control.

16:13.681 --> 16:18.601
She becomes a threat not just to you,
but to your business, your family.

16:18.852 --> 16:21.437
You are way out of line.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.399
Well, maybe
you don't have anything to hide.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.819
That's not what it says in here.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.279
- You cannot talk to me like this!
- Ben. Ben.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.448
- You cannot, you understand?
- Sit down.

16:32.658 --> 16:36.661
Nice and easy. Gentlemen, I'd like
a moment alone with my brother...

16:36.870 --> 16:38.496
With my client.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.791
If you don't mind?

16:42.584 --> 16:43.960
You have your moment.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.885
Ben, Ben.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.388
Ben, if you're gonna blurt out
a confession like that,

16:55.556 --> 16:58.182
it's gonna make our options
shrink down to a tiny little nub.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.019
All right, what are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

17:01.937 --> 17:04.313
Your alibi has been roasted.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.816
They can establish motive.

17:06.984 --> 17:10.737
And your blood
may have Laura's fingerprints on it.

17:14.908 --> 17:19.120
Ben, as your attorney,

17:19.371 --> 17:22.832
your friend, and your brother,

17:23.959 --> 17:29.297
I strongly suggest
that you get yourself a better lawyer.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.929
Okay, one last chance, Leo.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.057
Don't disappoint me.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.850
The mill?

17:47.649 --> 17:52.820
Okay, one last chance,
Leo. Don't disappoint me.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.572
The mill?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.157
Keep it simple.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.160
Insurance investigators
should read "arson."

17:59.328 --> 18:02.080
Block letters about, uh, 6 feet high.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.499
The deal as we discussed?

18:08.128 --> 18:11.756
Ben Horne, his voice,

18:11.924 --> 18:16.177
and Johnson's voice, Ben and Leo.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.643
Special delivery for Mr. Horne.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.108
Bobby. Oh, God.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.819
Bobby!

18:37.950 --> 18:39.867
He did it again.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.329
It's your turn to clean him this time.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.462
What's that?

18:52.089 --> 18:55.383
That is our ship.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.135
What's that mean?

18:57.594 --> 19:02.431
Since our cash cow in the other room
has turned into a sinkhole,

19:02.641 --> 19:06.686
I've decided to pursue a career
in business.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.938
Really? Like a salesman?

19:09.148 --> 19:13.985
Oh, no, I'm thinking
more executive suite.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.653
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.406
Bobby, that sounds great.

19:18.574 --> 19:23.536
I'm gonna give you
anything you want.

19:24.454 --> 19:28.291
Um, I want a full-time nanny.

19:31.170 --> 19:35.715
- Maybe a French maid.
- Bobby.

19:47.102 --> 19:49.437
- Hello, Norma.
- Mother.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.273
I trust those are real potatoes
and not flakes?

19:52.983 --> 19:54.192
Real potatoes.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.986
Excuse me.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.824
What a nice surprise to see you here.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.576
Mm! Hey, those are good.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.454
I see they taught
him a skill in the stockade.

20:06.663 --> 20:10.082
- Where is your charming husband?
- Hank? He's not here right now.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.043
I see.

20:12.377 --> 20:16.005
Mother, I got your message.
But if you don't mind my asking,

20:16.215 --> 20:18.257
what are you doing here?

20:18.592 --> 20:21.552
I want to introduce you
to my new husband.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.222
Husband?

20:24.431 --> 20:27.391
Ernie, this is Norma.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.102
Hi, how are you?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.897
- We're honeymooning. Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.817
I wonder if I could
bother you for a cup of coffee?

20:40.364 --> 20:42.657
- Nice girl.
- She's darling.

20:42.866 --> 20:45.493
Ernie's a financial analyst.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.663
I just love what you've done
with your diner, darling.

20:48.872 --> 20:51.249
The flowers add
such a measure of cheer.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.919
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

20:55.587 --> 20:59.090
Nice to see those good looks haven't
isolated themselves to one generation.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.470
- Yeah, I know, go with gold figures.
- Excuse me.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.766
You still look very smart
in that uniform.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.019
Your figure's lovely.
It hasn't changed.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.773
Now, I don't mean to be rude,
but how long will you be staying?

21:16.650 --> 21:20.319
A couple of days. Ernie wanted
to see something of the country.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.988
Why?

21:23.657 --> 21:25.366
I just wish I had known, that's all.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.702
Oh, I didn't mean for you
to go into any fuss.

21:27.869 --> 21:30.246
You know me, dear, I'm easy.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.123
What's wrong?

21:32.332 --> 21:35.167
Nothing, it's just that
there's a food critic coming

21:35.335 --> 21:37.586
and I'm short on help, that's all.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.548
Food critic. Ooh.

21:40.716 --> 21:44.093
So that's why you tried so hard
to make the place look nice.

21:44.344 --> 21:48.681
Norma, hoping to spend
much more time with you.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.766
If it's all right, we'd better check in.

21:50.934 --> 21:54.020
I've got a Tokyo fax
waiting for me at the desk.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.314
We'll be at the Great Northern.

21:56.523 --> 22:00.234
I'm sorry we missed Henry.
I'll call you later, okay?

22:00.444 --> 22:03.779
Okay. Nice to meet you.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.558
He's close.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.521
Nurse.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.648
Could I have
a glass of water, please?

22:39.816 --> 22:41.484
Yes, sir.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.588
I'm sorry.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.026
Hi, Norma.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.405
I guess I'm a little late.

23:27.739 --> 23:30.950
Forty-eight hours is not late, Hank,
it's missing.

23:31.159 --> 23:34.662
I'm sorry, it was some, uh...
Some business I had to take care of.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.997
Business? No, this is business.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.793
Business is a place where you come to
whether you feel like it or not.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.129
- Norma, I...
- Don't sweet-talk me,

23:43.296 --> 23:45.965
I'm this far from telling you
to take a hike.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.510
Norma, please don't make that
kind of judgment until you hear me out.

23:50.178 --> 23:52.763
Because of the bad choices
I've made,

23:53.265 --> 23:55.599
there are people out there,

23:56.726 --> 24:00.980
people from my past
who wanna see me fail.

24:01.314 --> 24:04.567
I've tried fighting them,
but I just get in more trouble.

24:05.235 --> 24:09.155
I've tried running from them,
but there's always somebody faster.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.159
I know it's no way for a man
to live his life,

24:13.326 --> 24:16.495
but sometimes it's just best

24:16.663 --> 24:21.125
to hold up and wait
for the storm to pass.

24:23.044 --> 24:25.337
I didn't mean to hurt you.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.593
I'm just trying to keep my head
above water.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.933
Maybe next time,
you'll ask for a little help.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.689
Next time, I will.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.109
Well, the prodigal son returns.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.779
- Heh, Vivian.
- Hi.

24:51.990 --> 24:55.034
- You look great.
- Thanks. Ha, ha.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.453
Prison treat you well?

24:57.954 --> 25:01.373
Well, uh, ahem, that's a long story.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.668
I'd like to hear it over dinner tonight.
I have a new husband.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.464
- Heh. Great Northern, 8:30?
- We'd love to.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.967
- I don't think if I'll be able to get there.
- We'll be fine, honey.

25:12.135 --> 25:13.886
Eight-thirty sharp, we'll be there.

25:21.019 --> 25:24.021
- Harry?
- Oh, hello, Pete.

25:24.231 --> 25:26.023
What you got?

25:26.775 --> 25:28.692
Woodpecker.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.779
Pileated, I think.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.575
Yeah. Here.

25:39.704 --> 25:42.915
Pileated woodpecker.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.210
Outstanding.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.463
Harry?

25:50.048 --> 25:51.840
Yeah, Pete.

25:53.385 --> 25:56.387
Harry, Josie's gone.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.598
Yeah, I know.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.934
When I came home
from the late shift,

26:02.143 --> 26:07.606
she left a note on the kitchen table,
no explanations, no goodbyes.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.483
A note.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.820
She sold the mill to Ben Horne.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.323
Well, not exactly.

26:16.491 --> 26:18.867
You don't have to explain.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.374
I loved her.

26:28.211 --> 26:30.129
There. I said it.

26:30.672 --> 26:33.215
- No offense, Harry.
- Eh.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.135
I loved her too.

26:38.305 --> 26:40.973
I stood there and watched her go.
Watched her assistant

26:41.141 --> 26:42.433
carry her bags away.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.435
Her assistant?

26:44.644 --> 26:46.895
Yeah, Asian fellow.
Never saw him before.

26:48.565 --> 26:49.648
What did he look like?

26:50.650 --> 26:53.694
Average height,
medium build, ponytail.

26:53.903 --> 26:56.280
Oh, that was her cousin, Jonathan.

26:56.990 --> 27:00.743
She said it was her assistant,
Mr. Lee.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.371
Mr. Lee?

27:07.042 --> 27:12.171
Harry, I have a bad feeling.

27:13.715 --> 27:17.051
- I'm right there with you, Pete.
- Harry.

27:17.260 --> 27:20.679
Hello, Pete. Gerard's missing.
He knocked the deputy out.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.390
Pete, you'll have to excuse us.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.024
He don't get far.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.821
Hi, sheriff. Agent Cooper.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.496
Lucy?

27:58.593 --> 28:01.804
- Lucy?
- What?

28:09.020 --> 28:10.854
Andy?

28:27.789 --> 28:29.206
Step right in, Pete.

28:29.416 --> 28:32.376
We desperate criminals
are locked safely in our cages.

28:32.585 --> 28:34.795
I have a message for you.

28:35.505 --> 28:39.049
Greetings from the boys
down at the mill?

28:45.515 --> 28:48.517
Ah. But first, a little music.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.563
Hello, Benjamin.

28:54.190 --> 28:57.526
Oh, I'm sorry I haven't
dropped by for a visit, dear.

28:57.736 --> 29:01.280
But I have a strong aversion
to prisons.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.199
- How awful...
- She's alive?

29:05.952 --> 29:10.956
The night
we spent together lost in love.

29:11.374 --> 29:15.043
When was that?
It seems so long ago.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.629
Almost like a dream.

29:18.506 --> 29:23.093
Oh, yes, I remember,
it was the night Laura Palmer died.

29:24.429 --> 29:27.973
Memory is so unreliable finally,
maybe it was a dream.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.559
Maybe it never happened.

29:30.727 --> 29:34.688
To tell you the truth,
I can't be sure anymore.

29:35.398 --> 29:38.734
What does she want? I'll pay anything.
What does she want?

29:39.152 --> 29:40.778
You okay there, Benji?

29:40.987 --> 29:43.655
In exchange for my testimony, dear,

29:43.865 --> 29:47.910
you will sign the mill and
Ghostwood Estates back over to me.

29:48.119 --> 29:52.289
I will consider letting you keep
your precious hotel.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.293
A representative of mine
will come to you

29:56.461 --> 29:59.755
with the documents within 24 hours.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.674
If you won't cooperate...

30:02.842 --> 30:05.427
Well, I'm confident
that you'll go on from here

30:05.595 --> 30:09.056
to excel in one or another
of the many fine career opportunities

30:09.224 --> 30:11.308
offered by the federal
prison system.

30:13.186 --> 30:16.271
Ben, so nice to see you again.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.360
She set me up.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.404
That Catherine.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.619
She set me up.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.957
She's a cautioned, isn't she?

30:53.059 --> 30:57.771
You set me up!
You bitch! You bitch!

30:58.439 --> 31:00.566
I'll get you, you bitch.

31:17.166 --> 31:23.505
Set me up.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.050
Chicks and ducks and geese

31:27.218 --> 31:28.385
Better scurry

31:28.595 --> 31:31.930
When I take you out in the surrey

31:32.140 --> 31:38.228
When I take you out in the surrey
With the fringe on top

31:48.990 --> 31:54.745
When I take you out in the surrey

31:56.414 --> 32:00.459
With the fringe on top

32:00.668 --> 32:05.005
Harry, are driver education programs
mandatory in your school system?

32:05.298 --> 32:07.132
Yep.

32:07.967 --> 32:10.510
I think we got a dropout.
Harry, look out.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.271
Uh-oh.

32:32.742 --> 32:36.119
With the fringe on top

32:43.586 --> 32:45.837
- Leland.
- Ah. Heh.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.216
Agent Cooper, Harry, I'm sorry.

32:49.592 --> 32:52.386
- Are you two all right?
- Leland, we're fine. How about you?

32:52.595 --> 32:54.721
Oh, sure, I'm fine, I'm fine.

32:54.931 --> 32:58.517
I was just on my way to the club
to try out a new set of irons,

32:58.685 --> 33:03.063
and, uh, I must have started
thinking about Ben.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.148
I guess my mind just wandered.

33:05.316 --> 33:08.485
It's a good idea to leave your troubles
at home when operating a vehicle.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.530
You're right, of course.
My apologies.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.075
Ah! I did remember something,

33:15.243 --> 33:19.579
as you asked,
about the night Laura died.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.291
I was working late at the office
with Ben, it was about 10:00.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.252
He left the room
to make a phone call.

33:25.420 --> 33:30.340
I don't know who he was talking to, but
his voice was raised, he was angry.

33:30.633 --> 33:33.468
I heard him mention
something about

33:33.803 --> 33:35.095
a dairy.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.849
- A dairy?
- That's what I think, yes.

33:39.058 --> 33:41.143
- A diary.
- That could be it.

33:41.310 --> 33:43.520
Sheriff Truman, this is Lucy.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.940
Are you there, sheriff?
I have an urgent message from Hawk.

33:47.734 --> 33:51.778
- Do you play golf, Agent Cooper?
- Uh, yes, Leland, I enjoy its precision.

33:51.946 --> 33:54.406
I'd like to invite you for a round
at the club someday.

33:54.574 --> 33:58.285
May I show you my new clubs?

33:58.870 --> 34:01.371
Uh, sure.

34:06.127 --> 34:07.794
Cooper.

34:08.296 --> 34:11.089
They found Gerard.
Near the waterfall.

34:11.299 --> 34:14.217
Better go. They're waiting for us.

34:15.470 --> 34:18.388
Let's go get him. Leland,
we'll see those clubs another time.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.932
I understand, Agent Cooper.
You let me know

34:21.100 --> 34:24.311
- if there's anything I can do to help.
- Will do.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.016
Poor Andy.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.644
You know, the exact
same thing happened to me

35:05.812 --> 35:07.270
when I first got pregnant.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.814
I would be out shopping,

35:08.981 --> 35:11.691
and then boom, pass right out
in the produce section.

35:12.026 --> 35:15.445
Then come to covered in bruises
and crushed fruit,

35:15.655 --> 35:19.825
and strangers standing over me
waiting to see if I was dead.

35:20.034 --> 35:23.829
You see, people want terrible things
to happen to you, I know.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.835
I wanna talk to you
about my sperms.

35:30.044 --> 35:33.255
Sperms?
You know, that is all men think about.

35:33.589 --> 35:36.091
You know, I remember
when little Carl was first born

35:36.259 --> 35:37.968
and they laid him out on my breast,

35:38.177 --> 35:41.888
I looked down and saw what kind of
a tiny little creature I was dealing with.

35:42.056 --> 35:48.520
And I thought to myself, I thought,
"My God, just what the world needs,

35:48.729 --> 35:54.276
another sperm gun running around
loose. Right? Women beware."

35:56.571 --> 35:58.029
Well, I did.

36:01.534 --> 36:06.204
I had mine counted twice.
The first time, they were all dead.

36:06.414 --> 36:11.543
Oh, man, if I had a nickel
every time I heard that one.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.838
- Second time, they were jumping like...
- What? What?

36:15.047 --> 36:17.048
- like salmon swimming upstream.

36:17.258 --> 36:21.344
So, of course, all you could
think of was spawning. Ha, ha.

36:21.971 --> 36:25.223
- Shut up.
- Shut up, Gwen.

36:33.274 --> 36:37.152
So when you told me that you were
pregnant, I didn't think it could be me

36:37.361 --> 36:41.364
because mine were all dead
supposedly at the time.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.325
Uh-huh.

36:43.492 --> 36:47.996
But they got better.
I was misinformed. I'm the father.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.918
Oh, brother.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.921
Aren't I?

36:56.130 --> 36:59.966
Oh, yeah. Oh, come here.

37:00.176 --> 37:04.054
You want to see
your mean Aunt Lucy.

37:06.015 --> 37:10.977
Oh, aren't you neat,
you little snooky-bookems.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.240
Oh.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.825
He's been close.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.205
Bob is not here now.

37:30.373 --> 37:33.583
Sheriff. Sheriff?

37:34.126 --> 37:37.420
Isn't there something
that you'd like to share with us?

37:38.256 --> 37:40.507
Oh, great.

37:41.008 --> 37:44.427
And would you tell this guy to stop
staring at me like I'm a dog biscuit.

37:44.595 --> 37:48.181
Bob has been very close.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.684
Who's Bob? I don't know a Bob.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.310
Do we know a Bob?

37:52.520 --> 37:57.565
Sheriff, no offense, but clearly,
this man's stairs do not reach the attic.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.651
Now, your 24 hours are up.

37:59.860 --> 38:02.487
You either charge my client
or let him go!

38:05.992 --> 38:10.829
Ben Horne, I'm charging you
with the murder of Laura Palmer.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.749
Yeah. Good move, Jer.

38:14.959 --> 38:18.336
Hawk, take Mr. Gerard
back to the hotel.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.714
- Nail all the windows shut.
- No. No.

38:20.881 --> 38:24.384
- I want two men on the door.
- You two-bit lumberjack.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.886
- You're finished in this town.
- Don't make it worse.

38:27.054 --> 38:28.096
You're finished.

38:29.682 --> 38:30.765
Calm down.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.143
- What are you doing?
- Step outside, please?

38:34.186 --> 38:35.895
I'm all right.

38:38.065 --> 38:42.110
Harry. Harry, I think we're saddling
the horse before we're ready to ride.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.611
I don't follow.

38:43.779 --> 38:46.072
I don't think Ben Horne
killed Laura Palmer.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.825
- What?
- You should release him.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.452
Cooper?

38:50.661 --> 38:54.331
I've backed you every step of the way.
I've had enough of the mumbo jumbo.

38:54.498 --> 38:58.084
I've had enough of the dreams,
the visions, the dwarfs, the giants,

38:58.294 --> 39:00.211
Tibet and the rest
of the hocus-pocus.

39:00.379 --> 39:03.465
Now, we've got hard evidence
against Ben Horne.

39:03.632 --> 39:05.842
It's my job to lock him up.

39:06.469 --> 39:09.095
You're right, Harry.
This is your back yard.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.890
Sometimes an outsider
can forget that.

39:19.690 --> 39:24.944
Well, the salmon was fresh and firm
and just a little bit overdone.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.864
- Mine too.
- Just right.

39:29.909 --> 39:31.951
Would you excuse me
for a minute, please?

39:32.119 --> 39:33.870
I'll join you.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.998
Ladies, hurry back.

39:54.683 --> 39:57.060
You're not gonna say anything,
are you?

39:58.187 --> 40:01.022
If Vivian ever found out
I'd been inside she'd...

40:01.232 --> 40:02.941
She'd drop me flat.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.984
I like your new hair color.

40:07.196 --> 40:09.072
Ernie Niles.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.616
Ernie "The Professor" Niles.

40:13.119 --> 40:15.412
- So when did you?
- A couple of weeks ago.

40:15.621 --> 40:17.122
Let me tell you, Ernie,

40:17.289 --> 40:21.084
without you in there to pal around with
the last six months were sheer hell.

40:21.293 --> 40:23.002
Nobody to go to the library with.

40:23.170 --> 40:26.339
Nobody to stamp out
license plates with.

40:27.174 --> 40:31.010
So, uh, what's your angle here
with Miss Moneybags?

40:31.220 --> 40:32.595
No angle.

40:32.763 --> 40:34.806
Come on, buddy,
we don't have any secrets.

40:34.974 --> 40:36.891
Vivian's rolling in dough.

40:37.351 --> 40:40.478
I met Vivian
at a Republican fundraiser.

40:40.688 --> 40:43.398
- We're married.
- Heh.

40:43.566 --> 40:46.651
You must have told her
some tall tale, a whopper.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.863
I'm trying very hard to tell nothing
but the truth these days.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.824
It's, uh, therapeutic.

40:53.325 --> 40:58.079
And Vivian wants me to handle
all her investments.

40:59.665 --> 41:02.459
What about yours?
Introduce her to your loan shark?

41:02.668 --> 41:06.754
I'm out of it, I'm out of it, Hank.
I don't gamble anymore.

41:06.964 --> 41:10.133
I go to meetings. I go to church too.

41:10.342 --> 41:12.635
So, what happens when
Vivian finds out that you ran off

41:12.803 --> 41:16.556
- with the congregation's picnic fund?
- I never stole from a church.

41:16.765 --> 41:19.225
It was a savings and loan.

41:19.768 --> 41:21.811
I was sick, it was an illness.
I paid my debt.

41:21.979 --> 41:25.190
It's a new life, a clean... Clean slate.

41:26.942 --> 41:29.986
- So she really doesn't know?
- No.

41:30.863 --> 41:33.490
Well, Ernie, this is interesting to me.

41:34.450 --> 41:38.286
Because family is the most
important thing in the world to me.

41:38.579 --> 41:42.916
One must be prepared
to pay any price to protect it.

41:43.125 --> 41:44.751
Don't you agree?

41:46.128 --> 41:49.464
Oh, yeah, yeah. I completely agree.

41:51.008 --> 41:52.675
We'll talk more later, Ernie.

41:52.885 --> 41:54.969
I've always enjoyed
our talks in the yard,

41:55.137 --> 41:57.722
man-to-man, prisoner-to-prisoner.

41:58.098 --> 42:01.184
- We're back.
- Ladies.

42:05.523 --> 42:09.067
I would like to propose a toast

42:09.276 --> 42:12.570
to the newlyweds
and their happiness.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.989
Thank you, Henry.
It's very generous.

42:15.157 --> 42:17.867
To Ernie and Vivian,

42:18.994 --> 42:23.331
to much success in their future
and all their future dealings.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.250
How sweet.

42:25.709 --> 42:27.502
That's sweet.

42:57.449 --> 43:02.787
Diane, it's 11:05 p.m. I'm in my room
at the Great Northern Hotel.

43:03.038 --> 43:05.873
There's not a star in the sky tonight.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.376
Ben Horne is in custody.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.920
The trail narrows, Diane.

43:11.130 --> 43:12.213
I'm very close,

43:12.381 --> 43:15.300
but the last few steps are always
the darkest and most difficult.

43:34.737 --> 43:36.779
- Hi.
- Audrey?

43:36.989 --> 43:40.283
- Can I come in and talk?
- All right.

43:41.702 --> 43:45.204
- Is that where you got shot?
- Yeah.

43:48.375 --> 43:49.792
Did you arrest him?

43:52.338 --> 43:53.838
Yeah.

43:55.090 --> 43:56.633
Did he do it?

43:57.176 --> 43:59.385
That's for a court to decide.

43:59.762 --> 44:01.304
What do you think?

44:02.264 --> 44:04.932
What I think
doesn't really matter right now.

44:05.142 --> 44:07.727
Did you arrest him
because of what I said?

44:07.936 --> 44:09.354
Only in part.

44:10.022 --> 44:11.773
But it helped?

44:12.566 --> 44:13.900
Yeah.

44:14.777 --> 44:19.489
All I ever really wanted
was for him to love me.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.492
I'm sure that he does.

44:24.203 --> 44:25.828
He's ashamed of me.

44:26.163 --> 44:27.497
No, he's not.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.590
Agent Cooper,

44:38.384 --> 44:42.887
when I was at One-Eyed Jack's,
I never, never let anyone...

44:43.055 --> 44:46.057
Audrey, you don't have
to say anything.

44:46.308 --> 44:47.892
I want you to know.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.852
I know.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.779
I have to get that.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.906
Okay.

45:08.497 --> 45:11.332
Cooper here. Where?

45:13.794 --> 45:15.503
How long ago?

45:15.963 --> 45:18.840
- I'm on my way.
- What's wrong?

45:19.007 --> 45:20.967
I want you to go to your room
and lock the door.

45:21.135 --> 45:24.095
- Why?
- No questions, do what I say.

45:24.304 --> 45:26.097
All right.

46:14.354 --> 47:20.002
It's Maddy Ferguson.
