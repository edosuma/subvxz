Clay killed his brother,
Daniel was excommunicated...

30:09.674 --> 30:12.308
That's a good thought, but
that was not his scent.

30:12.310 --> 30:16.045
- Look what the wolf dragged in.
- Logan: He's not kidding.

30:16.047 --> 30:19.478
He basically dragged me down
here from the front doors.

30:20.784 --> 30:22.851
It's good
to see you, Logan.

30:22.853 --> 30:25.520
Everyone's here,
let's get started.

30:25.522 --> 30:28.190
A local girl was
killed by a Mutt.

30:28.891 --> 30:31.893
Her body was dumped on
the outskirts of town.

30:31.895 --> 30:35.130
Now we have hunters
on the edge of our property.

30:35.132 --> 30:38.967
And with the bounty on this wolf,
you can be sure that there will be more.

30:38.969 --> 30:41.903
We're gonna put an end to this.
Tonight.

30:41.905 --> 30:43.405
Now, Elena has
pulled up files

30:43.407 --> 30:45.940
on Mutts with the most recent
vendettas against the Pack,

30:45.942 --> 30:47.496
starting with
Zachary Cain.

30:47.497 --> 30:50.398
I left him hurting.
He got the message.

30:50.403 --> 30:52.269
Let's not forget
that we could be dealing

30:52.270 --> 30:55.216
with anybody who's crossed
our path in the past.

30:55.218 --> 30:58.820
Peter and Logan, I want you
in West Bear Valley.

30:58.822 --> 31:01.122
Antonio and I will
cover Main Street.

31:01.124 --> 31:04.167
And I want the rest of you
to check out the industrial area.

31:04.425 --> 31:09.578

We stay upwind of them.
We'll smell them before they see us.

Simple fact is, if we find this
Mutt, I wanna be in wolf form.

31:42.870 --> 31:45.429

- He murdered a girl.

31:45.430 --> 31:47.051

been you.

Mr. Carter, you promised
proof of a werewolf.

him mid-transformation.

whatever you'd like.

40:48.688 --> 40:50.449
My plan is this -

40:51.024 --> 40:56.648
The hunter with the highest bid comes
down to Ecuador with me to catch it.

40:57.459 --> 41:00.021
- I thought you were gonna kill it.
- Eventually.

41:00.099 --> 41:03.234
But first, we're gonna make it
tell us where the others are.

41:03.236 --> 41:07.729
Because where there's one,
there could be hundreds.

41:07.911 --> 41:09.945

let you do that.

41:09.978 --> 41:12.912
