03:55.268 --> 03:57.441
Shut up. You'll be fine.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.279

03:59.339 --> 04:01.512
Hey..

04:01.575 --> 04:02.986
My kid

04:03.043 --> 04:04.249
Sit down.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.313
How dare you hit him? Let go.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.285
Ah.. Robin.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.521
Robin.
- Shut up!

04:40.580 --> 04:42.025
He will fall down.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.186
Robin!

04:43.717 --> 04:45.094
Robin!

04:45.152 --> 04:46.654

04:51.792 --> 04:53.738
My kid has fallen.
Stop the car!

04:54.194 --> 04:56.140
Stop the car!

05:01.134 --> 05:03.671
I think she's dead.
- Don't worry. - What are you doing?

05:03.737 --> 05:07.082
Take the gun.
Put it in the same bag with the money.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.609
Get out when I tell you to.

05:10.010 --> 05:10.750
Slow down! Slow down!

05:10.977 --> 05:12.752
Not this way.
That way.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.981
When I say. Okay?

05:19.119 --> 05:20.996
Jump! G0!

05:59.259 --> 06:00.966
I didn't do anything, sir.
lam just the driver.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.029
The other guy did all this.
He escaped.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.506
Take him away.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.073
Take him.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.200
Lock him up.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.012
Call an ambulance!

06:13.173 --> 06:16.746
"O crazy guys, recognize me."

06:16.977 --> 06:20.186
"O crazy guys, recognize me."

06:20.247 --> 06:22.284

06:45.338 --> 06:48.080
Okay, okay.
Now out with the truth. How was it?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.678
How was it?
I think it's a fabulous idea.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.382
Superb.
- I hope the boss finds it fabulous too.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.584
You know how he is.
"O Raghu..."

06:54.648 --> 06:57.458
You are sassing me.

06:57.517 --> 06:58.495
Where did you copy this from?

06:58.551 --> 07:00.030
Hey...it's original.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.963
She's going to live for a 100 years.

07:04.557 --> 07:05.968
Yeah, baby!

07:10.463 --> 07:12.136
Where's the emergency ward?
- Sir...Sir..

07:12.198 --> 07:13.302
Mr. Raghu.
- Yes.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.573
Your wife's in room no. 320.
- Thank you.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.249
Sir, I received a phone call..

07:23.310 --> 07:25.051
..saying that my wife
Misha met with an accident. - Please, come.

07:25.111 --> 07:25.987
It wasn't an accident.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.453
It's a robbery case.

07:29.015 --> 07:29.720
She was shot.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.122
The patient is critical,
you need to come this way.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.734
Misha.

07:42.595 --> 07:43.733
Misha.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.448
Where is Robin?

07:56.509 --> 07:57.647
Misha.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.514
You'll be okay, baby.

08:01.581 --> 08:02.525
Everything will be fine.

08:02.582 --> 08:06.962
L...l can't see anything.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.326
I can't see you.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.596
lam right here, Misha.
- Where are you?

08:11.658 --> 08:13.160
Right here. I am here.

08:13.226 --> 08:13.704
Where?

08:14.094 --> 08:15.300
Here, baby.

08:15.628 --> 08:16.299
I am scared.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.603
Misha, I am here.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.665
Misha.

08:18.732 --> 08:19.369
Misha.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.502
Raghu..

08:21.601 --> 08:22.545
'An-...

08:23.303 --> 08:26.250
I can't see anything.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.751
Please".

08:27.974 --> 08:29.749
Misha, I am here.
- Raghu.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.115
Relax. - Raghu.
- Misha.

08:32.979 --> 08:33.719
Misha.

08:36.649 --> 08:37.491
Misha.

08:38.485 --> 08:39.986
Misha.

08:40.754 --> 08:41.994
Misha?

08:43.655 --> 08:46.034
Can you.. Can you call the doctor?

08:48.762 --> 08:50.366
Can you call the doc..

08:57.303 --> 08:58.213
Pulse absent.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.483
My son Robin, where is he?

09:13.386 --> 09:14.456
It's a murder case now.

09:14.521 --> 09:17.968
I told him not to carry a gun.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.095
He said it was not loaded.
He said just do your job. Drive.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.503
Who? Who is your accomplice?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.563
Jayu! His name's Jayu. Jayant!

09:23.630 --> 09:24.540
Jayant?
- Yes.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.599
Everyone calls him Jayu.
- Where does he live?

09:26.666 --> 09:28.236
He lives in Yerwada.
- Huh!

09:28.301 --> 09:29.644
Close to Gunjan Talkies.

09:29.703 --> 09:30.613
What the..

09:30.670 --> 09:33.651
Close to the Xerox...
He lives close to the Xerox-shop.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.050
I see.

09:35.108 --> 09:38.988
How long have you known him?
- Since 3 weeks, sir.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.185
That is it.
I wanted a job.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.557
He said he could get me
a job in the Middle East!

09:43.616 --> 09:46.597
On one condition.... First
I had to help him do this robbery.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.728
I didn't know he had a loaded gun.
-Who fired the gun?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.236
I was driving, sir.
- Huh! You were driving?

09:52.292 --> 09:55.000
So who fired the gun?
-He did.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.268
lsee?
- Yes.

09:56.329 --> 09:59.208
I was driving.
-I am just a driver.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.242
I see.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.008
He was supposed
to get me a job in the Gulf.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.116
I didn't know it was loaded.
I didn't know.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.047
Sir...they're showing it on TV.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.195
How long?
Well, the Police are doing their job.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.390
We are on the job.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.761
Catching the criminal,
and we're doing that.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.023
We'll inform you as soon as
we get any information. Okay.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.434
Are you hiding anything?
- Sir..

11:18.011 --> 11:19.012
Raghu.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.222
Extremely sorry, son.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.558
The cremation is tomorrow at 4 pm.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.384
That's a lot of kidney beans.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.079
Are you planning
to serve this all week?

12:24.143 --> 12:27.090
It's Chilli-Corn Carne...Mexican.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.393
Robbie, come eat your dinner quickly.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.021
You still have to finish
your homework, don't you? Come.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.163
I will either eat...or do my homework.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.224
Get off that Casio right away.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.395
Come.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.663
Come here.

12:44.030 --> 12:48.035
If you eat this, I'll take
you to the dentist on Saturday.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.377
And if you don't,
then I'll take you to the movies.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.346
Understood?

12:51.404 --> 12:52.576
No, I didn't.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.812
Mom, what's papa saying?

12:55.041 --> 12:57.214
I wish I understood, son.

12:57.543 --> 13:00.353
How is it?
- Very nice.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.753
Scrumplicious

13:03.016 --> 13:04.518
I made a little too much.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.222
If you love me you'll eat it all week!

13:43.022 --> 13:44.023
Did you find him, sir?

13:46.759 --> 13:48.466
He killed them,
and ran away with the loot...

13:48.528 --> 13:49.700
..why are you hitting me?.

13:50.229 --> 13:53.176
Give me two clays, I'll find him.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.078
I heard him talking to some girl.

13:55.134 --> 13:55.737
Kalpana!

13:56.402 --> 13:58.109
He called up Kalpana.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.778
She was a tall girl.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.040
Typist."...

14:04.043 --> 14:06.023
Can I get some weed?

14:06.212 --> 14:08.488
It helps me think better.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.993
You want weed?

14:42.348 --> 14:45.090
Son, why don't you
come back with us to Delhi?

14:45.451 --> 14:46.657
Come stay with us.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.494
We'll take care of you...

14:48.554 --> 14:51.535
And this place...

14:51.657 --> 14:53.330
I mean...there's no rush.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.237
You can take your time. Yeah!

14:56.763 --> 14:59.403
Yes, son. Papa's right.

14:59.465 --> 15:02.309
Come with us to Delhi.
Drink some juice.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.517
Look, Raghu. Your in-laws
aren't eating anything either.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.684
Listen...rush to the supermarket..

15:10.743 --> 15:12.552
..and get some South
Indian instant food packets.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.990
I'll cook them a curry..
- Have you lost your mind?

15:15.014 --> 15:16.357
You're thinking about
food at this time.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.723
But they are not eating anything.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.464
But..
- I am not like you...

15:20.520 --> 15:21.999
to hide behind the newspaper.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.659
Who's hiding behind the newspaper?
- Be quiet.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.225
Son, drink some juice.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.367
Raghu...

15:46.412 --> 15:48.289
Last night we called our artist..

15:48.347 --> 15:50.520
..to make a sketch of his partner.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.725
And the result was this.

15:55.154 --> 15:56.394
Do you know who he is?

15:57.390 --> 15:59.097
Ranjeet! The actor!

16:01.260 --> 16:03.206
He's taking us for a ride.

16:03.262 --> 16:04.536
Sir, can I meet him?

16:21.647 --> 16:23.126
I know how you are feeling Sir...

16:23.583 --> 16:25.688
I can feel your pain.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.495
I can feel your pain.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.364
What happened was terrible.

16:33.459 --> 16:36.997
Jayu shot her,
I already told the inspector.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.534
Jayu!

16:41.067 --> 16:42.740
Can I have a minute with him?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.208
May I?

16:44.337 --> 16:47.284
I think they bumped off Jayu.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.484
And took the entire loot.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.214
I don't trust these cops.

16:52.278 --> 16:57.159
Maybe they split the loot 50-50.

16:57.216 --> 16:58.718
Honestly.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.962
I didn't shoot her.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.689
You rogue.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.627
You were there too.

17:08.728 --> 17:09.968
Hold him!

17:10.329 --> 17:13.138
Why did you kill her?
- Leave him.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.980
Let go off.

17:18.003 --> 17:19.574
It was you.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.542
You're the culprit.
You rogue.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.018
Stop, Raghu!

17:25.111 --> 17:27.990
Have you lost your mind?
You want to kill him?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.492
I will lose my job because of you.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.584
Take him away.

17:32.251 --> 17:33.594
Take him away.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.530
What are you staring at?

17:48.367 --> 17:49.710
Raghu!

17:50.536 --> 17:51.742
The phone's ringing?

17:52.004 --> 17:53.608
Nobody's picking up.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.548
Nobody's picking up the phone.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.145
Maybe he's not home.

18:15.528 --> 18:19.066

18:34.547 --> 18:37.255

my yoga class today.

18:37.316 --> 18:39.159
This is the best exercise,

Get him!

21:42.068 --> 21:43.138
Check the bag.

21:43.335 --> 21:44.678
You can go in.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.141

21:53.345 --> 21:54.483
You good for nothing!

22:05.024 --> 22:05.331
Tell me.

22:05.391 --> 22:06.995
Shame on you... You haven't
stopped your antics in here too.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.663
How did you get hurt? Speak up.

22:08.727 --> 22:11.298
Are you clone?
Have you brought my clothes?

22:11.363 --> 22:13.434
I did. It's outside.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.769
How long are they going
to keep you here?

22:17.002 --> 22:21.041
I don't know how long.
I haven't clone anything.

22:21.106 --> 22:24.349
Are you guilty of killing
that woman and child?

22:24.443 --> 22:27.014
I said it a thousand times.
I haven't clone anything.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.787
I didn't kill them.
- Swear on me.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.689
You think they'll free me if I do?

22:32.751 --> 22:34.025
Go back to the shop.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.401
Hello...excuse me.

22:47.766 --> 22:52.078
Are you heading towards the station?
- Yes.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.716
Can we go together?

22:53.773 --> 22:55.650
We can share the fare.

22:56.475 --> 22:58.113
Okay.
- Yes.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.521
Please".

23:01.280 --> 23:03.624

23:05.251 --> 23:06.992
What are you doing here?

23:08.754 --> 23:11.291
My sister-in-law framed my brother.

23:11.690 --> 23:14.728
I swear my brother's a noble man.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.564
He's been sentenced for 5 years..

23:16.629 --> 23:20.076
I swear he hasn't clone anything.
- It's okay.

23:22.201 --> 23:26.047
What are you doing here?
- My son..

23:27.006 --> 23:29.213
Good for nothing guy

23:29.275 --> 23:31.721

23:31.777 --> 23:33.347
A Wm”,

23:34.013 --> 23:36.118
What is your
daughter-in-law's business?

23:38.017 --> 23:41.055
You are a woman, you should know
what business she will be having.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.789
Where did he find this awful girl?

23:44.690 --> 23:46.067
Real name Jhimli.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.332
Professional name...Shabnum.

23:49.328 --> 23:51.604
She charges 5000 for 2 hours.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.040
And I charge 2000 for 24 hours.
How about that?

23:56.702 --> 23:59.046
Liak and she were
born in the same village.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.640
Grew up in the same neighborhood.

24:00.706 --> 24:03.209
Childhood friends.
Liak is crazy about her.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.655
She operates from Mumbai.

24:05.711 --> 24:09.625
There's a Shagun Beauty Parlor
near Regal Cinema.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.220
Ask for Mukesh aka ‘Mamu’.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.763
He's the pimp.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.021
I want to meet Shabnam.
- 10,000 for 2 hours.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.193
Get to this address by 8.

24:18.257 --> 24:21.329
I've sent a freshie.
Charged him double.

24:21.660 --> 24:22.604
Strip him clean.

24:30.135 --> 24:36.609
"My youth glitters like gold,
sweetheart."

24:38.210 --> 24:39.280
First time?

24:39.345 --> 24:44.761
"The world's crazy
about my silky body."

24:45.784 --> 24:50.665
"Is it my fault, sweetheart?"

24:50.723 --> 24:54.671
"Is it my fault, sweetheart?"

24:54.727 --> 24:58.800
"..that I blossomed
at such a tender age."

25:15.014 --> 25:18.689
"The world weighed
my beauty with pearls."

25:18.751 --> 25:23.063
"They made many excuses to cajole me."

25:23.122 --> 25:27.036
"The world weighed
my beauty with pearls."

25:27.092 --> 25:30.699
"They made excuses to entice me."

25:30.763 --> 25:32.242
Can I tie you up?

25:32.297 --> 25:35.744
"I've many fans."

25:36.001 --> 25:37.139
Like in the English movies, huh?

25:37.202 --> 25:39.307
"I've many fans."

25:39.505 --> 25:42.384
It will cost you 2000 extra.
- Okay.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.024
Hey...

25:50.649 --> 25:52.629
Extra for tearing up my dress.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.223
Okay.

25:54.486 --> 25:57.330
They are expensive, not the cheap
stuff one gets on Fashion Street.

25:57.489 --> 25:59.469
My top's worth 4000.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.701
How much do you make in a clay, Jhimli?

26:05.998 --> 26:07.409
Who are you?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.405
How do you know my name?

26:09.468 --> 26:11.072
What is Liak's partner's name?

26:11.136 --> 26:12.206
Liak who?

26:13.672 --> 26:14.742
Your boyfriend.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.350
I don't have a boyfriend.

26:16.442 --> 26:17.512
Everyone here is my boyfriend.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.749
Untie me or I will scream.
- Scream!

26:20.979 --> 26:22.014
Call the police.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.559
Who are you?

26:28.721 --> 26:30.098
Who are you?

26:30.155 --> 26:34.661
I am the one whose wife
and kid died in the bank that clay.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.297
Sir...

26:39.732 --> 26:41.143
Sir...forgive me.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.012
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.312
I know Liak.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.444
He's a friend...for many years.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.351
He loves me too.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.680
But he didn't like me working here.

26:53.745 --> 26:56.555
No one does this job willingly.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.719
But I was helpless.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.529
2 months ago Liak paid a visit.

27:01.587 --> 27:03.294
He said he'll get me out of here.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.966
And two clays later I saw on TV..

27:08.260 --> 27:10.638
He's a fraudster and thief....

27:10.696 --> 27:12.607
...but he's no murderer.

27:12.664 --> 27:13.699
Sir..

27:25.611 --> 27:29.081
I got 3.5 million on
my son's life-insurance.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.290
You can take it all.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.258
Just tell me who Liak's partner is.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.568
Warshid Akhtar.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.303
Liak Mohammed.

27:43.595 --> 27:46.007
Anand Kamble.

27:50.002 --> 27:50.742
You?

27:51.203 --> 27:52.511
What have you clone?

27:52.638 --> 27:54.481
I didn't kill them.

27:54.540 --> 27:57.077
I'm tired of telling everyone.
But no one's ready to listen.

27:57.142 --> 27:59.019
If you didn't kill them,
then why are you protecting him?

27:59.044 --> 28:02.184
Become an approver.
You'll face lesser sentence.

28:02.247 --> 28:04.693
I am ready,
but where will I find him.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.328
The Police have killed him
and kept the loot.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.297
Forget it,
say something dirty. Come on.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.129
What?

28:11.190 --> 28:15.297
You know...
these clays I talk to you a lot

28:15.394 --> 28:18.034
I speak your lines too.
-Which lines?

28:18.096 --> 28:21.009
The noises you make....
Please, no! Please, no!

28:21.066 --> 28:22.477
Please, no!
- Are you crazy?

28:22.534 --> 28:24.707
You're in jail.
- Come on.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.072
Do it.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.209
Just once.

28:28.273 --> 28:29.684
Raghav visited me yesterday.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.017
He knows my name.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.615
How did he find you?

28:36.081 --> 28:37.526
He was asking
for your partner's name.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.987
He said he'll pay me.

28:40.986 --> 28:43.091
Otherwise he was threatening
to go to the police.

28:43.655 --> 28:44.998
Hmm..

28:48.560 --> 28:50.039
So what will you do now?

28:50.095 --> 28:53.668
He said he same things
he told the police.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.010
He didn't say anything more.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.172
I am sorry.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.772
Did you tell him about me?

28:59.004 --> 29:00.312
Why would I tell him about you?

29:00.372 --> 29:03.114
I just asked him generally.

29:03.976 --> 29:04.954
Did he say anything else?

29:04.977 --> 29:07.014
He just kept staring
at me for a while.

29:08.313 --> 29:09.951
He was happy to see me.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.189
You're happy too?

29:15.287 --> 29:16.960
Were you haPPV?

29:17.189 --> 29:21.103
Look...l went there
because you asked me to.

29:22.327 --> 29:23.738
And I don't think he's clone anything.

29:23.962 --> 29:25.134
The poor guy's is innocent.
Trapped.

29:25.197 --> 29:26.733
And he won't lie to me.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.570
Don't waste your time and money.

29:31.536 --> 29:33.106
And cough up my money too.

29:33.739 --> 29:35.980
I've to pay commission
to Mukesh as well.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.645
And so many other expenses too.

29:43.348 --> 29:44.554
Thank you.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.254
Thank you.

30:03.669 --> 30:06.047
"My youth glitters like gold,
sweetheart."

30:06.104 --> 30:07.583
You please everyone, don't you?

30:08.340 --> 30:10.013
Now please me.

30:11.777 --> 30:18.092
"World is crazy after my beauty."

30:19.451 --> 30:24.196
"What's my mistake, sweetheart?"

30:24.256 --> 30:26.566
"What's my mistake, sweetheart?"

30:26.625 --> 30:28.366
What are you thinking? Dance.

30:28.460 --> 30:32.169

30:40.606 --> 30:46.284

31:04.129 --> 31:08.544
"The world weighed
my beauty with pearls."

31:08.600 --> 31:12.605
"They made many excuses to cajole me."

31:12.671 --> 31:16.517
"The world weighed
my beauty with pearls."

31:16.575 --> 31:20.523
"They made excuses to entice me."

31:20.579 --> 31:25.289
"lam like a bud...and
many bees are after me.."

31:35.060 --> 31:39.304
Next time you meet Liak,
tell him about me!

31:40.132 --> 31:43.341
The Court sentences Liak
to 20 years imprisonment..

31:43.602 --> 31:46.242
..for loot and murder!

31:46.304 --> 31:47.749
Don't worry.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.342
I'll do something.
- Move.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.149
I'll come see you.

31:51.209 --> 31:52.449

31:52.511 --> 31:53.615
Liak.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.818
Come on, move.. move..

31:58.150 --> 32:00.187
How many times do I tell you?

32:00.252 --> 32:01.754

32:03.722 --> 32:05.724
Any message for Jhimli?

32:07.125 --> 32:08.126
Come on!

32:08.627 --> 32:10.231
Don't go ahead.
- Sir.. sir..

32:11.663 --> 32:12.539

Go back.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.442
Keep him back.

32:19.538 --> 32:20.744
Get inside.

32:21.573 --> 32:22.449
Move.. move away.

32:22.507 --> 32:24.248

33:29.241 --> 33:32.017
I read the murderer's name

33:32.077 --> 33:33.784
The man hiding behind the cupboard..

34:10.614 --> 34:13.221
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.496
I've seen you on TV.

34:19.623 --> 34:20.601
Uncle.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.331
Isn't he from that TV serial?

34:24.429 --> 34:26.340
Why would a TV actor
travel on a train?

34:26.431 --> 34:28.377
If we can, so can he!
- He can't!

34:28.467 --> 34:31.380
Mister, aren't you Kusum's
husband from that TV serial?

34:33.205 --> 34:35.378
Did you take part in "Kaun Banega Crorepati
(Who wants to be a Millionaire"?

34:35.473 --> 34:36.713
Yes, I think I had seen him.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.152
I think he was one of
the contestants on that show.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.053
Must be! Looks familiar.

34:40.110 --> 34:42.022
Aren't you the guy
whose wife and kid were killed..

34:42.047 --> 34:43.492
..during the bank heist.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.728
Don't you have any manners at all?!

35:38.136 --> 35:43.210
"I search for my sweetheart."

35:43.642 --> 35:45.349
Have you lost your mind?

35:45.610 --> 35:46.350
Hey"

35:46.411 --> 35:48.049
Are you crazy?

35:48.113 --> 35:53.062
"But he is nowhere to be found"

35:54.619 --> 36:02.060
"His memory is a wound in my soul..."

36:02.460 --> 36:09.537
"Separation is my eternal destiny."

36:12.003 --> 36:13.141
Can't you understand?

36:13.672 --> 36:19.020
"It's lost...lost.."

36:19.344 --> 36:22.689
"What we stole away from time."

36:22.747 --> 36:26.559
"And hid in our dreams."

36:26.751 --> 36:32.429
"it's lost...lost.."

36:32.490 --> 36:35.664
"What we stole away from time."

36:35.727 --> 36:38.765
"And hid in our dreams."

36:39.030 --> 36:42.204
"The body's finely
woven like a cloth."

36:42.267 --> 36:46.044
"My eyes are drenched."
- Stand up. What happened?

36:46.071 --> 36:49.245
"The body's finely
woven like a cloth."

36:49.307 --> 36:52.413
"My eyes are drenched."

36:52.477 --> 36:55.617
What happened?
Stand up...what happened?

36:55.780 --> 36:59.455
"My eyes are drenched."

37:01.753 --> 37:03.528
Name?
- Raghu.

37:05.190 --> 37:07.329
Where are you from?
- Pune.

37:09.094 --> 37:11.973
How long will you stay?
- 20 years.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.408
After 20 years in jail..

37:18.470 --> 37:20.347
..you won't remember anything, Gabbar.

37:20.438 --> 37:26.616
No jail on earth...
can keep Gabbar caged for 20 years.

37:27.779 --> 37:30.259
And the clay I escape..

37:32.751 --> 37:34.025
Done yet? Be quick!

37:34.085 --> 37:35.120
This is all we have.

37:35.186 --> 37:36.665
And the others?

38:27.105 --> 38:29.051
Stop.. stop..

38:46.758 --> 38:48.465
Cabbage on Tuesdays.

38:48.526 --> 38:50.028
Gourds on Wednesdays.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.506
Eggplants on Friday.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.065
Potatoes on Saturday.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.542
Eggs on Sunday.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.442
A Beating on Monday.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.006
What clay is it today?

39:00.972 --> 39:05.011
Hey...what clay is it today?

39:05.944 --> 39:07.287
Hey"

39:23.428 --> 39:24.702
Chicken curry!

39:26.631 --> 39:28.110
Mutton!

39:30.001 --> 39:31.480
Mutton-leg soup!

39:32.237 --> 39:34.513
Bread. Whose birthday is it?

39:34.572 --> 39:37.052
It's my birthday, get in the line.
- Happy birthday to you!

39:38.576 --> 39:39.486
Move on.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.028
Hello.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.030
<i>Wage, come in,</i>

40:23.087 --> 40:25.465
There's a crow electrocuted
at picket no.3.

40:25.523 --> 40:28.367
We'll need to cut-off
the power-supply for 10-15 minutes.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.700
So we can get the crow out.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.679
Get him!

42:15.300 --> 42:18.281
I did meet him...in Tiharjail.
-Who?

42:18.336 --> 42:20.646
Charles Shobraj.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.185
What a deadly man.

42:23.241 --> 42:25.152
Amazing personality.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.683
He escaped from jail 14 times
- What are you saying?

42:27.745 --> 42:31.352
Afghanistan...Paris...Bangkok.

42:31.416 --> 42:33.327
He even broke out of Tihar.
- I see.

42:33.451 --> 42:35.124
And this Kaalia..

42:35.220 --> 42:36.290
Hey Kaalia..

42:36.454 --> 42:40.368
"It's impossible to restrain anyone.."

42:40.425 --> 42:45.101
"The hunter's a bit eccentric."

42:45.530 --> 42:47.168
"The bird will fly free one day.."

42:47.231 --> 42:48.733
Congratulations, Liak.

42:49.634 --> 42:52.080
This time you made
it out of the gates.

42:52.670 --> 42:56.812
Keep at it...you will definitely make it
to the bus stop in another 10-12 years.

42:57.608 --> 42:58.552
Hey, you..

42:59.644 --> 43:00.554
Catch him. Catch him.

43:01.746 --> 43:04.386
Catch him someone..

43:24.168 --> 43:25.340
I didn't do anything.

43:25.603 --> 43:26.604
He just fell down!

43:55.767 --> 43:58.771
Come and drench me, O rain!

43:59.037 --> 44:02.018
Come and drench me, O rain!

44:02.073 --> 44:06.249
Wash over me and cleanse my mind

44:06.311 --> 44:10.555
Wash over me and cleanse my mind

44:10.615 --> 44:13.425
Come and drench me, O rain!

44:13.484 --> 44:16.431
Come and drench me, O rain!

44:16.621 --> 44:19.329
How long can I hold back?

44:19.390 --> 44:22.200
How long can I hold back?

44:22.260 --> 44:26.333
The flute yearns to sing.

44:26.397 --> 44:30.368
The flute yearns to sing.

44:30.435 --> 44:33.314
How long can I hold back?

44:33.438 --> 44:36.078
How long can I hold back?

44:36.140 --> 44:40.020
The flute yearns to sing.

44:40.044 --> 44:44.015
The flute yearns to sing.

44:44.082 --> 44:46.790
It calls me..

44:48.553 --> 44:50.032
Mr. Raghav?

44:53.324 --> 44:56.066
Thank God! I should
be given a medal for finding you.

44:56.461 --> 44:57.531
May I come in?

44:57.595 --> 45:00.201
I don't want to buy anything.
- No, I am not selling anything.

45:00.264 --> 45:01.368
Please.

45:01.432 --> 45:02.308
Thank you.

45:07.972 --> 45:09.007
Shobha.

45:10.308 --> 45:12.288
I run a NGO. Prayaas.

45:13.044 --> 45:16.082
We work towards
rehabilitating jail inmates.

45:19.117 --> 45:20.289
Actually...

45:24.021 --> 45:26.763
I am here because of Liak.

45:27.024 --> 45:28.628
Liak Tungekar.

45:29.160 --> 45:31.197
He's got stomach cancer.

45:31.262 --> 45:33.640
He's got only a year.

45:33.998 --> 45:35.068
What do you want?

45:35.133 --> 45:37.374
He can be released
on medical grounds.

45:37.435 --> 45:38.641
Seek treatment.

45:39.136 --> 45:41.309
He can live the rest
of his life respectably.

45:42.507 --> 45:45.078
If...you give him a pardon letter.

45:47.111 --> 45:49.352
ls he in pain?
- Excuse me?

45:49.413 --> 45:51.086
Pain?

45:52.416 --> 45:55.295
Not yet, but...
he's undergoing Chemo.

45:55.353 --> 45:58.459
He should have been publicly
hanged 15 years ago.

45:58.789 --> 46:00.291
But this isn't bad either.

46:00.358 --> 46:01.962
He'll die a slow death.

46:12.003 --> 46:13.107
Actually...you've
come all the way here..

46:13.171 --> 46:15.117
to give me this news, so thank you

46:15.673 --> 46:17.209
Ms...?
- Shobha.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.084
Shobha.

46:19.410 --> 46:21.321
I feel like celebrating today.

46:21.546 --> 46:23.287
I might order a Chinese meal.

46:23.347 --> 46:26.351
Raghav, Liak's been
in jail for 15 years.

46:26.417 --> 46:28.260
He's sick, and he's dying.

46:28.319 --> 46:30.458
And all he asks is
to die outside jail.

46:30.588 --> 46:33.034
In his own home, close to his mother.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.264
Only you can fulfill his last wish.

46:36.327 --> 46:39.638
So p|ease...forgive him.

46:40.998 --> 46:43.137
Do you have kids, Ms. Shobha.

46:43.634 --> 46:46.205
I have a daughter...Nitasha.

46:47.371 --> 46:49.009
She's in the 4th grade.

46:55.446 --> 46:59.690
Imagine if someone like Liak abducts
your daughter, and kills her.

46:59.750 --> 47:01.388
And you have see her dissected body..

47:01.452 --> 47:06.026
..in the postmortem
room of some hospital.

47:07.525 --> 47:11.701
Will you forgive?
Because it's been 15 years?

47:14.999 --> 47:16.410
I don't know.

47:17.335 --> 47:18.507
But I do know...

47:18.569 --> 47:21.675
...that people can change
after spending time in jail.

47:22.406 --> 47:24.181
Meet him once.

47:24.475 --> 47:28.013
See for yourself, and then decide.

47:30.448 --> 47:32.257
I've brought his reports.

47:32.316 --> 47:35.627
I just want to show
you all these things.

47:37.421 --> 47:39.025
Goodnight.

47:51.602 --> 47:53.343
I've left my card.

47:53.571 --> 47:55.517
In case you change your mind.

47:58.643 --> 48:00.520
Be careful at the over-bridge.

48:01.112 --> 48:03.023
It gets foggy during the monsoons.

48:05.449 --> 48:10.057
With or without your help...
Liak will find release in a year.

48:10.221 --> 48:11.564
That's the decision of God.

48:12.456 --> 48:13.730
But what about you?

48:14.725 --> 48:18.172
You don't even have a picture
of your wife and child in this house.

48:19.063 --> 48:20.667
You're in a prison yourself.

49:50.354 --> 49:51.697
Mr. Raghav?

49:53.057 --> 49:55.196
Govind Mishra, remember?

49:55.259 --> 49:57.603
Three promotions,
two bypass surgeries!

49:59.196 --> 50:01.472
I am retiring at the end of the month.

50:01.666 --> 50:04.237
But an open case still hurts.

50:06.070 --> 50:10.485
If Liak is released,
he will surely contact his partner.

50:11.008 --> 50:12.681
And then you will catch him, right?

50:17.248 --> 50:19.194
Madam, fruits aren't allowed inside.

50:19.250 --> 50:20.752
Let him take it.

50:21.085 --> 50:22.155
Okay.
- Thank you.

50:22.220 --> 50:23.221
Yadav.

50:41.639 --> 50:43.175
Thank you, sir.

50:45.543 --> 50:48.149
If you forgive me,
I can get out of here.

50:48.679 --> 50:51.285
They say I've got only
one year left to live.

50:53.250 --> 50:54.558
My life's..

50:54.618 --> 50:56.427
My life's ruined.

50:58.656 --> 51:04.004
I feel terrible about
what happened to your family.

51:05.229 --> 51:07.209
I've heard all this 15 years ago.

51:09.100 --> 51:10.170
Tell me something new.

51:12.436 --> 51:13.608
Shall I?

51:14.338 --> 51:17.547
I feel so terrible about your family..

51:18.242 --> 51:20.415
The first thing I'll do after
getting out is meet my partner..

51:21.011 --> 51:22.422
..take my share of the loot.

51:23.147 --> 51:26.253
And have a good time
with Jhimli for 10 months.

51:29.453 --> 51:30.454
No, Liak.

51:32.323 --> 51:34.269
There's just one
way to get out of here.

51:36.193 --> 51:37.604
Tell me the name of your partner

51:37.661 --> 51:40.073
How can I tell you what I don't know?

51:40.297 --> 51:43.073
I tried telling the police..
- You're going to die here.

51:47.171 --> 51:48.309
You have a family?

51:49.340 --> 51:50.546
A Daughter.

51:51.676 --> 51:55.385
Don't you find this job tough?
- Yes.

51:58.782 --> 51:59.760
Raghu?

51:59.817 --> 52:01.160
Excuse me.

52:14.431 --> 52:23.146
"As you set foot on
the threshold of my heart."

52:23.207 --> 52:31.183
"I dedicated my life to you forever,
beloved."

52:31.248 --> 52:34.229
"I learned to live...live.."

52:34.285 --> 52:39.701
"I learned how to live, sweetheart."

52:39.757 --> 52:44.263
"I don't know how to liven"

52:44.328 --> 52:49.573
"I don't know how to live
without you, sweetheart."

52:54.538 --> 52:58.816
"Every word I said
about you...is true."

52:59.043 --> 53:03.389
"Straight from my heart."

53:03.447 --> 53:06.985
"Since we met..."

53:07.051 --> 53:11.124
"..my world feels beautiful, my love."

53:11.188 --> 53:15.659
"I've finally found my sky."

53:15.726 --> 53:20.175
"We complete each other."

53:20.231 --> 53:28.048
"I dedicated my life to you forever,
beloved."

53:28.105 --> 53:32.554
"I learned to live...live.."

53:32.610 --> 53:37.025
"I learned how to liven"

53:38.682 --> 53:41.288
Sir, I am Liak's mother.

53:41.352 --> 53:43.298
Forgive me,
but I am not signing any letter.

53:43.587 --> 53:45.191
Sir..
- Sorry.

53:46.023 --> 53:50.335
Sir, I know who was
Liak's partner in crime.

53:51.362 --> 53:52.534
Sir.

53:55.533 --> 53:58.639
I know...his partner's name.

53:59.804 --> 54:02.114
Did Liak send you?
- No, sir.

54:02.339 --> 54:04.615
He'll kill me if he finds out.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.554
Last week he called me from jail.

54:09.980 --> 54:12.756
He told me his partner's name..

54:12.983 --> 54:14.223
..and asked me to contact him.

54:14.285 --> 54:17.232
I've got his phone number and address.

54:18.355 --> 54:20.995
Don't let my son die in jail.

54:21.024 --> 54:22.332
Come in.

54:23.260 --> 54:25.069
Forgive him.
- Come in.

54:25.462 --> 54:27.533
You know his partner's name
and address, don't you?

54:27.598 --> 54:30.636
Yes, sir.
- Come...p|ease sit.

54:36.340 --> 54:37.341
Sir.

54:37.474 --> 54:39.476
Sir, I have been blessed with
a baby girl. Sweets for you.

54:39.543 --> 54:41.079
Congrats.
- Thank you, sir.

54:41.145 --> 54:43.022
Sir, you've to come over
for the naming ceremony.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.219
Sorry, I am going on a break.
- Are you going home?

54:45.282 --> 54:46.454
Yes.

55:06.303 --> 55:09.307
On 27thMay, 2000 Liak Tungekar..

55:09.406 --> 55:13.183
..and his missing accomplice murdered
my wife Misha and son Robin.

55:13.244 --> 55:15.190
..during a bank heist.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.292
The court sentenced Liak
to 20 years in prison..

55:17.347 --> 55:19.588
..of which he has served 15.

55:19.650 --> 55:22.756
Last week I was informed
that Liak is suffering from cancer.

55:23.053 --> 55:24.031
I can never forgive him...

55:24.088 --> 55:27.194
the senseless deaths
of my wife and child...

55:27.257 --> 55:30.033
And yet, Liak dying in jail
won't give me any solace.

55:30.594 --> 55:34.064
I request the court to cut short
the remainder of Liak's sentence.

55:35.466 --> 55:36.774
I want him to be released..

55:37.000 --> 55:39.606
..so that he can receive treatment
and live the rest of his..

55:39.670 --> 55:41.172
...life with dignity.

55:47.177 --> 55:49.350
lam going...to the bus stop.

55:49.413 --> 55:51.518
And then straight to Bangkok.

55:51.582 --> 55:54.256
I'll get all the massages.
Thai...Sandwich...the works!

55:54.318 --> 55:55.262
Give him a good foot massage ok...

55:55.319 --> 55:56.559
Do it correctly, okay?

56:16.273 --> 56:17.411
Yeah.

56:19.243 --> 56:20.449
But why did you break the legs?

56:24.281 --> 56:27.160
They're foreigners;
they want the entire roast chicken.

56:27.985 --> 56:28.588
Yeah.

56:28.652 --> 56:30.222
Good morning, sir.
It's on the third floor.

56:31.221 --> 56:32.666
See you.

58:13.657 --> 58:14.658
0h!

58:40.150 --> 58:41.857
Excuse me, do you need help.

58:41.985 --> 58:43.726
No, I am fine.
Thanks.

58:47.524 --> 58:48.559
Okay.

58:57.734 --> 59:00.180
Listen...l said I don't need help.

59:00.837 --> 59:03.249
My husband's on his way to pick me up.

59:03.907 --> 59:05.682
You can...go.

59:07.077 --> 59:09.148
Do you read the papers?
- What?

59:09.279 --> 59:10.986
This area isn't safe.

59:11.281 --> 59:14.990
Recently there's been a
few robberies and a murder.

59:15.652 --> 59:18.758
Don't worry, I'll wait
here until your husband arrives.

59:19.256 --> 59:21.566
No, no, no, I am fine. Really.

59:24.561 --> 59:26.700
If you wish, I'll wait by your car.

59:26.764 --> 59:28.641
You can take my car.

59:28.832 --> 59:31.210
There's a petrol pump up ahead,
you can get help.

59:39.710 --> 59:42.281
Do you watch films?
- Sometimes.

59:43.146 --> 59:46.650
When a girl asks for
a lift on a deserted road at night...

59:46.717 --> 59:49.527
either the driver's a
serial killer, or the girl's a ghost.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.224
You think negative.

59:51.288 --> 59:53.029
It can be a romantic film too.

59:53.256 --> 59:57.568
"I met a beautiful stranger.."

59:57.895 --> 59:59.772
Okay, okay...

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:03.168
I've a big-tough husband,
and he has your number.

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:05.736
Really?
- Of course, I just messaged him.

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:08.276
Whether you're a lover or a killer,
you'll be caught.

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:11.109
Already caught, madam.
- Oh, you're married.

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:12.552
Thank God for that.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.145
I was really scared.

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.615
Lovely.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.250
And he's so adorable.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:20.886
What are their names?
- Misha. Robin.

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:22.986
Oh...very cute.

01:00:25.022 --> 01:00:26.262
Was it a love-marriage?

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:29.634
Oh...so sorry. I am just
returning from a wedding, so..

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:31.001
..that's the only thing on my mind.

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:33.667
You don't have to answer that at all.
- Love marriage.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.232
Ours was a love-marriage too.

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:42.676
It's here?

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.584
Yes, on the left.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:50.589
Thank you. Thank you so much,
I really appreciate it.

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:54.153
Coffee?
- Won't your husband be at home?

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.522
Actually, we own a restaurant.

01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:59.624
Konkan Queen.
- ls that yours?

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:00.690
Yes, it's in Vimaan Nagar.

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:02.737
It's the best sea food in Pune.

01:01:02.793 --> 01:01:04.773
Why don't you bring Misha
and Robin along? - Yeah.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:06.535
Please come.
Okay.

01:01:06.563 --> 01:01:08.099
Kanchan.
- Raghu.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.769
Take care, Kanchan.

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:13.030
Hi.
- Surprise!

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:15.098
Oh, my God.
What a pleasant surprise.

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:16.735
Did you meet Harman?
- No.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.279
Hold on.

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:24.915
<i>This is RaghumHarman.</i>

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:26.646
He dropped me home last night.

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:27.780
Hello, Harman.

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:29.153
Thank you.

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:30.623
Sit.
- Yeah.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:34.561
You didn't bring
Misha and Robin along?

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:38.327
They are no more.
- What?

01:02:38.555 --> 01:02:43.504
Actually, they died 15
years ago during a bank heist.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.734
I am so sorry.

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:46.671
I didn't get the opportunity
to tell you last night.

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:48.175
And you were already so stressed.

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:49.938
I didn't want to bring up the past.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.742
Oh my God. I am really sorry.
What a tragedy.

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:55.682
No, the real tragedy
is that it's been 15 years..

01:02:55.806 --> 01:02:57.979
..and the murderer is still at large.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:04.281
lam very hungry.
What's the specialty here?

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.851
I'll just get it.
You'll love it.

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:13.289
Cheers.

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:32.585
Have we met before?

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:36.151
You have met my wife and child.

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:38.555
Main Street, Bank robbery.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:41.652
What rubbish.

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.563
Nonsense.

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:49.930
I know everything, Harman.
- What do you know?

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.238
You know nothing.

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:56.271
If you know, why don't you go to
the police? What are you doing here?

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:57.944
I wanted to get a good look at you..

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.537
..before I go to the police.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:01.982
Anyway...

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:02.982
Sit.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:07.988
What do you want?

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:10.854
You need to eat this by hand,
for better taste.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.216
Thank you.

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:15.187
By the way, your husband
has invited me home tomorrow..

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:18.859
..for lunch.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:21.227
I forgot the sauce.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:23.635
I'll be back in a bit. Okay.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:29.233
She doesn't know anything.

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:32.580
Please don't involve my wife.
- See you tomorrow.

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:36.548
At lunch.

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:43.657
Where did he go?

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:46.249
He got an urgent phone call.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:06.236
Hi, Raghu.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.141
Liak will be released tomorrow.

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:13.010
I was thinking about...
meeting you personally".

01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:14.113
..to say thank you.

01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:15.418
When can we meet?

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:29.759
Hello, Harman.
- Hi.

01:05:29.826 --> 01:05:30.998
Please sit.

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:37.603
Lunch was a great idea,
thank you.

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:39.109
I am so sorry!

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:40.844
I really am sorry.

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:43.913
Harman told me everything last night.

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:46.476
I don't..

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.924
Look, I admit I was involved
in that bank robbery.

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:53.023
But I didn't murder your wife and kid.

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:54.719
I swear.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.661
Liak fired the gun.

01:05:56.853 --> 01:05:58.230
I was in the back seat.

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:00.126
I didn't know that gun was loaded.

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:01.863
Liak says the same thing.

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:04.766
I am really sorry.

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:11.805
Nice house.

01:06:12.903 --> 01:06:15.543
Misha would've really
liked this house.

01:06:21.111 --> 01:06:22.954
Misha loved these things.

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:26.789
Everywhere we went,
she collected these things.

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:28.989
But never took them out.

01:06:30.186 --> 01:06:33.963
She would say that Robin might
break it, or... Pune's too dusty..

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.168
She liked all this.

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:39.973
What do you want from us?

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:44.137
What can you give?

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.476
Money.

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:48.479
No.. No..

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:50.978
Oh my God.

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:52.248
Oh my God.

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:56.716
No.. No.. No..

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:57.224
Alright.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.584
You'll give me money?

01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:00.493
How much can you give?

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.734
10 million.
You have 20 seconds.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.737
Give me a better answer,
Or I'm calling the police.

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:17.107
25 million.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.710
I've Liak's share as well.
You can take that too. - Take everything.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:24.750
Everything.
The hotel, house...everything.

01:07:24.808 --> 01:07:28.813
l...know Harman.
He can never kill anyone.

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:31.557
I am sorry. I am sorry.

01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:34.024
Forgive us, please.

01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:38.524
Harman. Kanchan loves you a lot.

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:40.566
Apologize to her.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:44.034
Say "I am a murderer, Kanchan".

01:07:45.095 --> 01:07:49.771
"Yet you want to save me. Thank you."
- Okay.

01:07:50.033 --> 01:07:51.171
Say it!

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:53.536
Say it!

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.748
Kanchan, I am a murderer.

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:00.915
Yet you want to save me.

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:03.647
Thank you.

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:09.790
"I forgive you, Harman."

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:11.725
Say it.

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:15.764
I forgive you, Harman.

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:18.328
"But in return." Say it.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:25.103
But in return...
- I want to sleep with Raghu.

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.211
Please stop..

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.754
I am ready. I am ready.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:35.687
I am ready. I am ready.
- Raghu...

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:37.349
Koko! Go away.
- I am ready.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.026
Go away Koko. Have you lost your mind?
- Will you leave us alone then?

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:42.221
What are you saying?
- Just shut up!

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.231
Do you want him to go to the police?

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:46.897
Come, the bedroom's upstairs.

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:48.662
Have you lost your mind?

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:50.102
Come on.
- Koko.

01:08:50.158 --> 01:08:52.298
I'm ready to do anything you want.
- Koko.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.908
Just shut up!

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:58.207
Now you...try and forget this!

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:03.276
No... Koko!!

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:23.295
Take your clothes off.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:30.801
Right here.

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:14.552
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:17.915
You're ready to sleep
with me to save a murderer?

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.152
He killed a child.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:21.893
He's a murderer.
- No, no..

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:22.656
He..
- No.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:25.325
Harman didn't kill Misha and Robin.

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:28.701
I believe him, please trust me.

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:34.707
Okay.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.939
Let's have some fun.

01:11:04.127 --> 01:11:07.233
If you fall down the stairs outside...

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:10.969
You'll hurt your leg, won't you?
- Yes.

01:11:11.234 --> 01:11:12.713
How will you scream?

01:11:13.303 --> 01:11:14.247
Scream?

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:15.679
Scream.

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:16.975
<i>Louder.</i>

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.712
<i>Louder.</i>

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:21.578
<i>Louder.</i>

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.787
Say my name.
- Raghu.

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:33.299
Raghu. Raghu.

01:11:33.556 --> 01:11:34.261
Raghu.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.237
Scream. Scream. Scream.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.068
Scream.
- Raghu.

01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:44.506
Yes, Kanchan!

01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:45.807
Yes, Kanchan!
- Raghu.

01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:47.176
Yes, Kanchan!

01:11:51.674 --> 01:11:53.779
Liak is being released tomorrow.

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:57.085
What was the agreement
between you two?

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:03.763
I have to keep his
money and passport ready.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.766
He said he'll call me once he's out.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.567
When Liak calls,
you'll tell me, right?

01:12:16.099 --> 01:12:17.077
Yes.

01:12:18.635 --> 01:12:20.205
Lunch was good.

01:12:21.271 --> 01:12:22.909
I'll be back.

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.226
Nothing happened.

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:37.064
Nothing happened, Harman.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:40.960
He didn't even touch me.

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.035
I think he's trying to torture us.

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.095
He's completely insane.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:50.234
Nothing happened.

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:26.713
Greetings, auntie.

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:28.739

Idiot, you became a priest.

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:42.861
Drop in at the Church.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.626
You were supposed
to come tomorrow.

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:50.170
Fine, I'll come tomorrow.

01:13:51.494 --> 01:13:52.734
Come on in.

01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:03.013
I had prayed to Ajmer Sharif.

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:07.250
Now that you're back,
We must go...

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:10.555
Who'll look after the tea shop?

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:34.007
Pakya, get me some soda.

01:14:36.606 --> 01:14:37.983

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.747
She was also called Shabnum.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:42.923
She worked here 15 years ago.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:44.788
This isn't Maratha Mandir?

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.052
Want me instead?

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:51.254

01:14:56.059 --> 01:14:57.129
You?

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:00.733
When did they release you?

01:15:00.797 --> 01:15:02.037
Didn't you hear?

01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:03.873
It was in the newspapers.
- What?

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:06.037
I did some good deeds in jail..

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:08.013
..so, they released me early.

01:15:08.071 --> 01:15:09.550
Won't you invite me in?

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:18.150
Did you break-out of jail?

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.554
Ohhh...my veggies

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:31.129

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.797
Nice flat.

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:34.969
This is a classy pad. Wow

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:36.203
Who gave you the address?

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:38.108
I went to the old haunt

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:40.571
Why did you go there?

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:42.206
I went looking for you.

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:44.742
How about a drink?

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:48.986
Do you drink so much?
- No, he gets it.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.649
He can't take it home.

01:15:52.782 --> 01:15:54.728
This is Patill sir's home.

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:57.123
Lives in Jalna with his family.

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:58.631
He comes here once a week.

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:05.836
ls Patil a...politician or gangster?
- He is loaded.

01:16:06.829 --> 01:16:08.604
Wants to be a politician.

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:15.209

I'll return it.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.675
How much?

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.047
Whatever you can lend me.

01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:19.711
I'll return it with interest.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.077
Yeah.

01:16:22.545 --> 01:16:24.218
You cannot pay my interest.

01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:47.977
Tell me something..

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.011
<i>How is Pat“ as a person ?</i>

01:16:53.476 --> 01:16:54.546

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.680
You did?

01:16:59.916 --> 01:17:02.021
Does he love you?

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:04.154
What do you care?

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.503
Tell me.

And you do it
all by going to jail.

Take this money and get lost.

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:57.015

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.766
Harman will be back by 2 o'clock.

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:33.136
So...we've very little time.
Lets go!

01:25:33.829 --> 01:25:34.899
Where?

01:25:34.997 --> 01:25:36.237
The bedroom.

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.300
Keep the wine in the fridge.

01:26:02.725 --> 01:26:05.228
Go take a shower, and wear this.

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:08.201
Go.

01:26:26.615 --> 01:26:28.959
Hello, Harman. Where are you?

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:30.587
He's here.

01:26:32.221 --> 01:26:35.202
No, he's having tea.
Everything's fine.

01:26:35.257 --> 01:26:37.999
No, I'll handle it. I am fine.

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.131
Okay. Bye.

01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:01.880
Kanchan.

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:04.554
Where's Kanchan?
- Upstairs.

01:28:05.814 --> 01:28:07.088
Money?

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:15.166
Passport...and money.
Here you go.

01:28:17.926 --> 01:28:19.064
Kanchan.

01:28:20.329 --> 01:28:22.036
Where are you?

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:25.108
Koko.

01:28:25.834 --> 01:28:26.676
Koko.

01:28:26.735 --> 01:28:29.011
Koko. Koko.

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:31.139
Koko. Koko.

01:28:31.206 --> 01:28:34.085
Koko. Koko.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.951
She's alive. She's alive.

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:38.115
Oh God!

01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:42.891
I'll call the ambulance.
Ambulance.

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:44.622
The ambulance did come.

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.188
They even took her to the ICU.

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:48.165
The doctors did everything.

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:52.163
But she still died.

01:28:55.230 --> 01:28:59.736
Koko. Koko.
- Harman.

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:01.303
Koko.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:02.712
Harman.

01:29:02.771 --> 01:29:05.115
Koko. Koko.

01:29:05.174 --> 01:29:10.624
Her eyes were open,
but she couldn't see me.

01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:13.326
And she died.

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:14.717
Hi.
- Hi, Shobha.

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:18.121
You're late, but I forgive you.
Come.

01:30:18.981 --> 01:30:20.119
Come.

01:30:24.119 --> 01:30:26.793
So she's Natasha.
- Yes.

01:30:26.855 --> 01:30:29.734
She studies in a hostel.
Just went back yesterday.

01:30:33.562 --> 01:30:34.700
And husband?

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:37.769
Divorced.

01:30:45.507 --> 01:30:47.953
I talked to Liak, he was happy.

01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:50.012
He's getting good treatment.

01:30:50.078 --> 01:30:53.025
All because of you.
- Because of you.

01:30:53.515 --> 01:30:55.995
Not just Liak, you saved me as well.

01:30:56.051 --> 01:30:58.691
For the first time in 15 years,
lam out on a date.

01:30:59.221 --> 01:31:01.827
And I am...happy.

01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:04.161
Thank you.

01:31:04.226 --> 01:31:05.637
I am happy too.

01:31:13.302 --> 01:31:15.805
Do you always play
these kiddie games..

01:31:15.871 --> 01:31:17.851
..or, are you interested
in something else too?

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:22.989
My daughter plays this. So we
always learn two new words every clay.

01:31:23.045 --> 01:31:25.047
That's why we play this.

01:31:26.715 --> 01:31:28.592
Would you like to play with me?

01:31:32.888 --> 01:31:34.731
What's that?
- What?

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.132
This?
- What?

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:40.732
New shirt.

01:31:50.272 --> 01:31:53.515
Shall I draw the curtains
or we move to the bedroom?

01:32:20.802 --> 01:32:22.873
"Oh my enemy.."

01:32:24.139 --> 01:32:26.881
"..you're close to your end."

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:29.986
"Oh my enemy.."

01:32:30.045 --> 01:32:31.820
"..you're close to your end."

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:35.555
"I am an infidel for you."

01:32:35.617 --> 01:32:37.324
"| changed..."

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:39.156
"My heart changed.."

01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:42.532
"My God has changed."

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:44.570
"Everything changed..."

01:32:44.626 --> 01:32:46.628
"When I changed myself.."

01:32:46.695 --> 01:32:50.643
"My God has changed."

01:32:58.106 --> 01:33:00.143
What's your name?

01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:01.585
Raghu.
- What?

01:33:01.643 --> 01:33:02.849
Raghu.

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:04.514
Have you been drinking?

01:33:04.546 --> 01:33:05.684
No. Just committed a murder.

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:08.057
What rubbish.
Get going.

01:33:11.153 --> 01:33:13.224
What did he say?
- Joker.

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:15.898
"Oh my enemy.."

01:33:15.991 --> 01:33:17.595
"Oh my enemy.."

01:33:17.659 --> 01:33:19.639
"..you're close to your end."

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:21.537
"..you're close to your end."

01:33:21.563 --> 01:33:23.236
"Oh my enemy.."

01:33:23.298 --> 01:33:25.073
"..you're close to your end."

01:33:25.133 --> 01:33:28.774
"I am an infidel for you."

01:33:28.837 --> 01:33:30.680
"| changed..."

01:33:30.739 --> 01:33:32.582
"My heart changed.."

01:33:32.641 --> 01:33:35.554
"My God has changed."

01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:39.285
"My God has changed."

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:52.037
SP sir.

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:57.735
First you sent goons
dressed as police.

01:33:57.799 --> 01:33:59.210
"Sway it..."

01:33:59.267 --> 01:34:04.512
"Sway it, sweetheart."

01:34:04.539 --> 01:34:08.180
"My waist sways-J.

01:34:09.678 --> 01:34:13.524
"My waist sways-J.

01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:17.028
"When I sway to the left,
I create a stir."

01:34:17.085 --> 01:34:21.625
"When I sway to the right,
I shake the entire district."

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:55.225
Sit down.

01:34:59.728 --> 01:35:02.504
Hello.

01:35:02.564 --> 01:35:04.237
Kind attention..

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:09.708
If any undeclared or suspicious
object found under the seat.

01:35:24.619 --> 01:35:25.620
Hello, Liak.

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:31.067
What are you doing?

01:35:31.126 --> 01:35:32.696
Just wanted to know how you're doing.

01:35:34.796 --> 01:35:36.139
How are you?

01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:37.805
Okay.

01:35:41.937 --> 01:35:43.211
Are you waiting for someone?

01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:48.618
No.

01:35:53.548 --> 01:35:55.789
Your friend's not coming.
- What friend?

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.118
Where's Harman?

01:36:27.782 --> 01:36:29.625
<i>He's gone to Shire“ with the missus.</i>

01:36:30.685 --> 01:36:31.527
Shirdi?

01:36:31.553 --> 01:36:32.156
Yes.

01:36:32.921 --> 01:36:35.299
Liak's been visiting Konkan Queen
Restaurant for the past few clays.

01:36:36.057 --> 01:36:37.297
Yesterday he went there twice.

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:40.537
ls the food good?

01:36:41.730 --> 01:36:45.769
It's spicy... Tasty!

01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:49.472
You're bound to get a promotion.
Send Kadam.

01:36:49.504 --> 01:36:51.074
Sir, they've been missing for 5 clays.

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:52.482
Their mobiles are switched off too.

01:36:52.507 --> 01:36:54.987
They booked a room at
the Sun N Sand hotel, Shirdi.

01:36:55.043 --> 01:36:56.147
But they never checked in.

01:36:56.211 --> 01:36:58.088
The car's missing,
and the house locked too.

01:37:03.485 --> 01:37:05.692
Why do you visit
Konkan Queen so often?

01:37:06.154 --> 01:37:07.792
Their prawns are really good.

01:37:08.857 --> 01:37:12.031
You travel 12 kilometers
for their sea-food.

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:13.639
You're quite the food buff.

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:23.206
Why did you evade my man
at the cinema hall that clay?

01:37:28.643 --> 01:37:29.781
Did you come here?

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.024
I went to get some weed.
I am ill.

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:38.525
Your people follow me around,
no one sells me the stuff.

01:37:40.155 --> 01:37:41.190
What happened here?

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:45.900
What do you think?

01:37:48.129 --> 01:37:49.301
I feel".

01:37:50.832 --> 01:37:52.277
Hold on.

01:37:55.637 --> 01:37:56.877
Stop.

01:37:58.773 --> 01:38:00.616
What's he doing here?

01:38:02.544 --> 01:38:04.023
I gave Mrs Harman a lift once.

01:38:04.546 --> 01:38:06.548
And she invited me
to the restaurant.

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:09.918
Good homely food.

01:38:10.919 --> 01:38:12.694
Liak was praising the food as well.

01:38:14.255 --> 01:38:15.791
What do you want to say?

01:38:16.124 --> 01:38:19.867
15 years ago,
Harman worked in a small garage.

01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:22.141
Salary, only 2000.

01:38:23.131 --> 01:38:24.701
But suddenly he hit some jackpot..

01:38:24.766 --> 01:38:26.245
..and now owns a posh restaurant.

01:38:27.702 --> 01:38:30.808
So you mean...
Harman is Liak's partner.

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:35.209
Congratulations, sir.
Finally you found him.

01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:40.783
Found him? Not really

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:47.824
The couple's been
missing since the 5th.

01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:50.095
So?

01:38:51.159 --> 01:38:53.036
You were in Pune on the 5th, right?

01:38:53.828 --> 01:38:54.306
Yes.

01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:56.904
Where were you?

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:01.306
I was on a lunch date.

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:03.114
With Shobha.

01:39:04.272 --> 01:39:05.216
At her home.

01:39:07.542 --> 01:39:08.043
How long?

01:39:09.544 --> 01:39:10.181
8 pm.

01:39:12.146 --> 01:39:13.318
8 pm.

01:39:18.019 --> 01:39:21.262
8 pm is my dinner time.

01:39:21.322 --> 01:39:22.665
See you.

01:39:23.591 --> 01:39:25.036
Bye, sir.

01:39:30.598 --> 01:39:33.010
Did you tell anyone about Harman?

01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:37.345
I never told anyone.

01:39:40.342 --> 01:39:43.812
Be honest, and I won't harm you.

01:39:44.879 --> 01:39:46.790
I said I didn't tell anyone...

01:39:51.085 --> 01:39:52.587
Yes, I did.

01:39:52.787 --> 01:39:53.993
I told Raghav.

01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:56.625
And that's the reason you're out here.

01:39:57.792 --> 01:40:00.272
You didn't do a thing
for last 14 years.

01:40:00.528 --> 01:40:02.530
And now you're
threatening your mother.

01:40:13.675 --> 01:40:17.020
What did you tell the inspector?
We had sex?

01:40:17.078 --> 01:40:20.890
All I said that when
I left you were asleep.

01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:22.291
What for?

01:40:22.617 --> 01:40:25.223
You know he asked
me such absurd questions.

01:40:25.286 --> 01:40:27.823
No one ever dared to speak to me like that..
- This is a police investigation.

01:40:27.889 --> 01:40:31.063
I will have to answer
all their questions.

01:40:31.126 --> 01:40:33.163
I don't believe this.

01:40:34.562 --> 01:40:37.202
I thought there was
something between us.

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:42.009
I really liked you.
- Maybe I didn't like you.

01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:44.880
You sympathize with the
criminals in jail, don't you?

01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:50.513
But what about the people
whose lives they ruined?

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.157
You used me, right?

01:40:55.016 --> 01:40:56.757
Maybe the inspector's right.

01:40:57.685 --> 01:40:59.528
You are involved in some murder.

01:40:59.587 --> 01:41:01.157
He might arrest me.

01:41:01.222 --> 01:41:03.031
Put me in jail.

01:41:03.091 --> 01:41:05.731
Then you'll come visit me.
Hold my hands.

01:41:05.794 --> 01:41:07.774
Relieve my pain.

01:41:08.062 --> 01:41:10.269
Sympathize with me.

01:41:11.266 --> 01:41:13.212
And we can even have
sex in the doctor's cabin.

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:14.706
How dare..

01:41:55.276 --> 01:41:58.120
Where's the money?
Where's the money?

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:02.291
Where's my money?

01:43:45.019 --> 01:43:46.123
Where's my money?

01:43:48.122 --> 01:43:49.066
My friend?

01:43:53.194 --> 01:43:55.037
I killed Harman and his wife.

01:43:57.231 --> 01:43:58.232
You killed?

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:01.535
How did you kill them?

01:44:02.236 --> 01:44:03.237
With a hammer.

01:44:04.572 --> 01:44:06.984
In their own bedroom.

01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:13.549
Do you want to know how?
How I did it? Do you want to hear?

01:44:17.251 --> 01:44:19.595
First I covered the room with plastic.

01:44:20.221 --> 01:44:22.531
When his wife stepped
out after a shower..

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:24.901
...I severed a blow to her head.

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:26.869
She fell unconscious.

01:44:27.662 --> 01:44:31.542
Next, when Harman returned
with the money, I killed him too.

01:44:32.667 --> 01:44:34.169
You really killed them?

01:44:37.605 --> 01:44:40.984
Your friend, whose name
you didn't utter for 15 years..

01:44:42.476 --> 01:44:45.184
..was ready to give
me your share of the money.

01:44:47.515 --> 01:44:53.591
And his wife was ready
to sleep with me...to save him.

01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:56.491
Are you telling the truth?

01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:02.537
I buried them in
Khadakvasla sector 3.

01:45:03.197 --> 01:45:05.734
And you will never
find that money.

01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:14.518
And now you're going to kill me too.
- You're already dead.

01:45:15.276 --> 01:45:17.222
You're just going to rot
for few more months.

01:45:51.779 --> 01:45:53.816
Harman didn't kill your wife, I did.

01:46:00.154 --> 01:46:03.499
I was confused.
I went crazy for a moment.

01:46:03.524 --> 01:46:05.663
Your kid fell out and
your wife was screaming.

01:46:05.726 --> 01:46:08.138
Suddenly I pulled
out the gun and shot her.

01:46:09.597 --> 01:46:11.042
I had blown a fuse.

01:46:15.803 --> 01:46:16.941
But you had a cool mind.

01:46:18.272 --> 01:46:20.183
You murdered two people...
with a hammer.

01:46:21.843 --> 01:46:22.981
Innocent people.

01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:26.858
What is the difference..
between you and me

01:46:29.851 --> 01:46:30.852
You've gone crazy.

01:46:32.253 --> 01:46:33.630
Get yourself treated.

01:47:10.624 --> 01:47:12.035
What happened to you?

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.264
What happened?

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:17.600
Show me.

01:47:17.765 --> 01:47:19.642
Your face is completely swollen.

01:47:20.034 --> 01:47:22.275
You're back to your old ways, right?

01:47:22.670 --> 01:47:24.047
What are you looking at?

01:47:24.839 --> 01:47:26.147
Jhimli.

01:47:27.508 --> 01:47:28.885
lam going to die.

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:31.882
Huh?

01:47:34.849 --> 01:47:38.092
That's why I was released from jail.
I've got cancer.

01:47:38.552 --> 01:47:40.532
I've just one year to live.

01:47:44.725 --> 01:47:45.669
Yes.

01:47:45.726 --> 01:47:47.000
I was scared to know.

01:47:48.996 --> 01:47:51.533
When I was released,
I thought I'll get my share..

01:47:51.565 --> 01:47:55.570
..because I didn't utter
my partner's name for 15 years.

01:47:56.604 --> 01:48:00.984
And we'll travel, have fun
for 1 O months with that money.

01:48:03.911 --> 01:48:05.219
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

01:48:06.914 --> 01:48:08.587
I wanted to surprise you.

01:48:08.649 --> 01:48:10.253
"Jhimli.."

01:48:14.621 --> 01:48:16.658
Okay, madam...
I'll change this.

01:48:16.724 --> 01:48:19.898
Chicken noodles, right?
- Hey...stop.

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:21.999
Who are you?

01:48:22.563 --> 01:48:25.601
Sameer.
From Uncle's Kitchen.

01:48:27.268 --> 01:48:28.576
Sameer.

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:32.680
How's Tony?

01:48:33.641 --> 01:48:36.019
He's fine, okay.
- Okay?

01:48:36.577 --> 01:48:38.147
Give him my regards, alright?
- Okay.

01:48:38.212 --> 01:48:39.850
Tell him I was missing him.
- Fine.

01:48:41.215 --> 01:48:44.094
Tony died a month ago.

01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:46.026
Who is he?

01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:49.558
You misunderstand, sir..
- Shut up.

01:48:49.623 --> 01:48:52.695
He's a friend,
we're meeting after a long time.

01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:56.030
Your friend calls
himself a delivery boy..

01:48:56.096 --> 01:48:59.043
..and walks out with the parcel,
and you just watch.

01:48:59.099 --> 01:49:00.840
You think I am a fool.

01:49:02.136 --> 01:49:03.809
What are you staring at?

01:49:04.571 --> 01:49:06.573
Are you back to whoring again?

01:49:07.241 --> 01:49:09.243
Why you..
- Liak! Liak!

01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:10.720
Stop it.

01:49:10.778 --> 01:49:12.086
Keep it down.

01:49:12.146 --> 01:49:14.148
Liak, let go.
Liak! Get lost.

01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:17.287
Get out. Go.

01:49:17.551 --> 01:49:19.588
Hey...
Go inside!

01:49:19.787 --> 01:49:20.663
Go inside!

01:49:33.334 --> 01:49:34.574
Hey"

01:49:36.837 --> 01:49:38.282
Wait. Wait.

01:49:40.007 --> 01:49:41.145
Are you okay?

01:49:41.809 --> 01:49:43.811
I told him about your cancer.

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:44.947
Here.

01:49:47.515 --> 01:49:48.755
I don't want it. Keep it.

01:49:48.816 --> 01:49:50.762
Keep it, it's for your treatment.

01:49:50.818 --> 01:49:52.229
I'm getting free treatment
from the government.

01:49:52.286 --> 01:49:53.697
Don't worry. Keep it.

01:49:53.754 --> 01:49:55.734
I'm sure you have other expenses.

01:49:55.990 --> 01:50:00.166
Yeah, I do...if you come along.

01:50:00.227 --> 01:50:01.672
Will you?

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:04.799
l...can't come now.

01:50:05.533 --> 01:50:07.274
He'll be here till Monday.

01:50:07.968 --> 01:50:09.606
After that

01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:18.787
Say something dirty.

01:50:20.948 --> 01:50:22.552
What was it?

01:50:23.050 --> 01:50:24.154
If..

01:50:24.218 --> 01:50:26.926
If you bite I'll slap you tight.

01:50:51.178 --> 01:50:54.716
Keep the money.

01:50:55.716 --> 01:50:58.094
I was supposed to get 25 million.

01:50:58.519 --> 01:51:01.728
But Raghu killed
my partner and his wife.

01:51:01.789 --> 01:51:03.063
Now watch what I do to him....

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:05.865
Don't do anything.
Wait..

01:51:07.862 --> 01:51:09.102
I committed a murder.

01:51:10.297 --> 01:51:12.004
I am a convicted killer.

01:51:12.699 --> 01:51:17.773
If you ever hit her again,
I will kill you. Goodnight.

01:51:47.635 --> 01:51:49.979
Where are you going?

01:51:50.237 --> 01:51:51.807
Cleaning my house.

01:51:52.139 --> 01:51:53.846
What brings you here?

01:51:54.976 --> 01:51:56.512
I'd like a cup of tea.

01:52:02.749 --> 01:52:06.959
You didn't tell me that
you went to Harman's home too.

01:52:07.288 --> 01:52:09.859
Fingerprints. Perfect match.

01:52:09.957 --> 01:52:11.800
They invited me for lunch.

01:52:12.026 --> 01:52:15.166
You get a lot of
invitations for lunch.

01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:23.980
Where's the money?
- What money?

01:52:24.171 --> 01:52:26.242
Don't play that game with me.

01:52:26.673 --> 01:52:28.653
Liak's share of money.

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:31.311
From the bank robbery

01:52:32.279 --> 01:52:35.317
You're clearly visible
in the CC camera at Aundh signal.

01:52:35.649 --> 01:52:37.629
In Harman's car.

01:52:37.918 --> 01:52:40.694
You murdered Harman and his wife.

01:52:49.496 --> 01:52:51.100
What will you prove in the court?

01:52:51.899 --> 01:52:54.505
That l, whose wife
and kid were killed..

01:52:54.769 --> 01:52:58.615
..first pardoned Liak,
and then murdered his partner.

01:52:59.273 --> 01:53:00.775
For money?

01:53:02.242 --> 01:53:03.812
Sugar?

01:53:07.247 --> 01:53:09.227
You might escape death sentence.

01:53:09.283 --> 01:53:11.194
But jail term is guaranteed.

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.691
Give me the money...

01:53:16.657 --> 01:53:18.136
...I'll erase all evidence.

01:53:19.593 --> 01:53:21.004
Or else..

01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:22.903
Looking for your retirement fund.

01:53:29.069 --> 01:53:30.139
Call it what you may.

01:53:32.773 --> 01:53:34.548
I'm retiring on Monday.

01:53:35.309 --> 01:53:39.553
You have until Monday, 11 o'clock.

01:54:16.817 --> 01:54:20.287
These clays I've no clue
about your whereabouts.

01:54:20.787 --> 01:54:22.562
You're just like your father.

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:26.900
Go have your dinner,

01:54:40.174 --> 01:54:43.644
You always curse my father.

01:54:46.213 --> 01:54:48.193
There must be something
good about him.

01:54:50.150 --> 01:54:51.561
Tell me.

01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:56.195
What do I say?

01:54:56.256 --> 01:54:58.566
There must be
something good about him.

01:55:00.227 --> 01:55:03.504
Why are you trying
to stir up the past.

01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:05.871
Forget it.

01:55:07.501 --> 01:55:08.878
Forget it.

01:55:21.215 --> 01:55:24.025
I specifically said
a bouquet worth 500 rupees...

01:55:24.718 --> 01:55:26.755
What's going on?
What's all this?

01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:29.528
Sir, it's your send-off today.

01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:31.628
Good.

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:33.766
ls it clone?

01:55:34.094 --> 01:55:35.732
Liak, listen.

01:55:37.531 --> 01:55:39.738
Go back to your stall.
Stop following me.

01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:41.473
Get back to the stall.
- Listen.

01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:44.043
Liak.

01:55:49.476 --> 01:55:51.513
If anyone asks if there's
something good about your son..

01:55:53.013 --> 01:55:55.516
..so you will tell them,
won't you?

01:55:55.582 --> 01:55:56.652
Please do.

01:55:59.119 --> 01:56:00.564
Yes, sir.

01:56:01.655 --> 01:56:02.861
My last clay at work today.

01:56:04.024 --> 01:56:06.664
What have you decided?
- You won't get the money.

01:56:06.727 --> 01:56:07.865
Congratulations
for your retirement.

01:56:07.961 --> 01:56:09.531
Don't be smart.

01:56:09.696 --> 01:56:12.267
lam coming there.
- Do what you want.

01:56:14.734 --> 01:56:15.712
Where's my driver?

01:56:15.769 --> 01:56:18.249
Sir, he's gone home
to fetch your family.

01:56:18.505 --> 01:56:20.849
Come on, get the car.
- Sir, please don't go.

01:56:20.941 --> 01:56:23.785
It's a small program.
- I'll be back soon.

01:56:27.581 --> 01:56:30.528
I killed Harman and his wife.

01:56:31.885 --> 01:56:33.193
What?

01:56:33.253 --> 01:56:35.130
I killed those two.

01:56:35.188 --> 01:56:38.226
I barged in their bedroom.

01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:41.469
Covered the floor with plastic..

01:56:41.929 --> 01:56:44.842
..and hammered them to death.
They're both dead.

01:56:44.932 --> 01:56:47.503
He said he won't give me my share.

01:56:48.568 --> 01:56:50.605
He refused to recognize me.

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:53.913
The bodies are at
Khadakvasla sector 3.

01:56:56.576 --> 01:56:58.487
I know you didn't commit the murders.

01:56:58.512 --> 01:56:59.752
What's your game?

01:57:02.016 --> 01:57:03.222
Tell me.

01:57:05.252 --> 01:57:06.754
Say you didn't kill them.

01:57:11.158 --> 01:57:13.035
Say you didn't kill them.

01:57:16.763 --> 01:57:18.504
Say you didn't kill them!

01:57:20.233 --> 01:57:21.837
You didn't kill them!

01:57:22.736 --> 01:57:25.717
Say you didn't kill them!
Say it!

01:57:25.772 --> 01:57:27.217
Say you didn't kill them!

01:57:27.707 --> 01:57:30.119
You didn't kill them!

01:57:31.011 --> 01:57:32.786
Say you didn't kill them!

01:57:34.014 --> 01:57:35.152
Please move back.

01:57:35.215 --> 01:57:36.216
Please move back.

01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:40.030
Sir, you finally solved
a 15 year old case....

01:57:40.086 --> 01:57:42.896
On the clay of your retirement.
How do you feel? Please tell us.

01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:43.559
Feeling good.

01:57:43.623 --> 01:57:45.534
It's a historic clay for you, sir.
How do you feel?

01:57:45.592 --> 01:57:46.696
Was Liak taken to jail?

01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.206
How will you recover the stolen money?

01:57:49.262 --> 01:57:52.641
By selling Konkan Queen,
or do you have another option?

01:57:52.699 --> 01:57:55.009
How long will he be sentenced to now?

01:57:55.068 --> 01:57:56.547
Please sir...p|ease.

01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:59.551
Please tell us...please..

01:57:59.573 --> 01:58:00.711
Sir..

01:58:10.284 --> 01:58:11.558
Pick that up, take it.

01:58:21.595 --> 01:58:23.575
Pawan, I asked you to get cigarettes.

01:58:23.597 --> 01:58:26.339
I've got it. - Did you?

01:58:34.141 --> 01:58:36.143
I had a great time in Bangkok.

01:58:40.347 --> 01:58:42.190
He committed two murders.

01:58:58.131 --> 01:58:59.804
You didn't go today either.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.276
I've told you many times.
Chemo will help you relieve the pain.

01:59:03.170 --> 01:59:04.808
And what happened last night?

01:59:04.871 --> 01:59:06.646
You fainted again, didn't you?

01:59:06.707 --> 01:59:10.177
No, it was just..
I pretend to be in pain.

01:59:11.111 --> 01:59:13.853
So they give me some weed.

01:59:15.148 --> 01:59:16.752
Why are you working on a Sunday?

01:59:16.817 --> 01:59:18.819
Nobody else is.

01:59:18.885 --> 01:59:21.991
I make one chair in four clays.

01:59:22.055 --> 01:59:26.003
And outside it sells
for...3000 rupees.

01:59:29.229 --> 01:59:33.336
You're good at it,
keep this one for me.

01:59:34.567 --> 01:59:36.569
Will you get me a discount?

02:00:07.234 --> 02:00:09.578
Your wife and kid's killer is dead.

02:00:09.636 --> 02:00:10.808
I know.

02:00:11.805 --> 02:00:15.150
So you must know...why he
turned himself over to the police?

02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:17.814
Took the blame for your crimes.

02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:22.224
To give you a second chance.
