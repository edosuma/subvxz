your own jail on a contempt citation.

I'm sorry, okay?
I was wrong.

29:54.657 --> 29:57.354

You terrified that family. I had to spend
all day tryin' to calm 'em down.

There are two witnesses, but I promised them
anonymity. I can't break that promise.

- No.

We've always gone with your judgment.

This wasn't something I planned.

30:48.678 --> 30:51.340

30:53.983 --> 30:56.611
Of course I have, but what
was I supposed to do,just let her die?

30:56.686 --> 30:59.212
There is no missing girl,
