WEBVTT

00:03.902 --> 00:04.994
These are curse boxes.

00:05.170 --> 00:08.628
Supposed to keep the evil mojo in, right.
Like the Pandora deal?

00:08.807 --> 00:11.367
They're built to contain
the power of the cursed object.

00:11.543 --> 00:14.842
Frank's been working on the numbers
that Bobby spent his last breath on.

00:15.013 --> 00:17.481
- It's coordinates.
- To what?

00:17.649 --> 00:23.451
A field in Wisconsin, recently purchased
by Wellman Inc., a subsidiary of...

00:23.622 --> 00:27.524
You wanna win, you gotta be the shark.
Sharks gotta eat.

00:27.692 --> 00:30.525
Richard Roman Enterprises.
Ready to build something.

00:30.695 --> 00:33.289
- Build what?
- Exactly. What?

00:33.465 --> 00:35.797
I'm a grade-A freak, but I'm managing it.

00:35.967 --> 00:39.198
Something's definitely different now.
You let me in.

00:39.404 --> 00:41.929
- Shut up.
- He said "shut up" to me.

00:42.107 --> 00:44.507
Think you can use your tricks
to banish me again?

00:44.676 --> 00:47.304
Like that? No, I do believe
I've got you, bunk buddy.

00:54.786 --> 00:55.980
No Irena again.

00:56.154 --> 00:58.281
- Guess she's too famous for us.
- Heh.

00:58.456 --> 01:01.584
No, she just wants to be alone.

01:10.535 --> 01:13.163
Irena, a little late for practice, no?

01:13.338 --> 01:16.535
Never too late. Practice makes perfect.

01:16.708 --> 01:18.972
If you have the talent.

03:10.689 --> 03:14.557
Dick's funding an archeological dig?

03:15.160 --> 03:16.821
Unless Dick's digging himself...

03:16.995 --> 03:19.463
...I'm not sure
I know what to do with that, Frank.

03:19.631 --> 03:23.499
Or the factory in Saudi Arabia.
Or the fishery in Jakarta.

03:23.668 --> 03:24.862
None of this is helping.

03:25.070 --> 03:28.597
Explain how Western to Southeast Asia
is too wide a net.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.798
You know,
I could be in Tromso right now.

03:30.976 --> 03:33.376
<i>Zero Leviathan activity in Tromso.</i>

03:33.578 --> 03:36.479
- Where the hell is Tromso?
- Norway, you moron.

03:38.149 --> 03:41.710
By the way,
they opened another Biggerson in Butte.

03:41.886 --> 03:44.480
- Well, we're not in Montana.
- Oh, you know where Butte is.

03:44.656 --> 03:46.556
That's encouraging. So where are you?

03:46.725 --> 03:51.162
<i>- We're in Oregon.
- No, I got nothing in Oregon.</i>

03:51.329 --> 03:52.660
Wisconsin, Frank.

03:53.798 --> 03:56.892
- What about it?
- The coordinates. Bobby's coordinates.

03:57.102 --> 04:00.663
Bobby? Oh, right.
Yeah, no, I got nothing.

04:00.839 --> 04:03.034
- I got no activity.
- Well, work on it.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.142
Hey, when did you become
the boss of me?

04:05.310 --> 04:07.904
Don't like what I'm doing,
stick it up your Montana.

04:08.113 --> 04:09.671
All right. Take it easy, Frank.

04:09.848 --> 04:11.338
Oh, and another thing...

04:11.516 --> 04:15.043
Frank? Hello? Fra...

04:16.353 --> 04:18.345
- He's a crazy son of a bitch.
- Who, Frank?

04:18.523 --> 04:20.582
You know, having a cranky,
total paranoid...

04:20.759 --> 04:23.091
...as your go-to guy, that's...

04:23.261 --> 04:25.320
I don't know what it is.

04:25.497 --> 04:28.227
Going for the Guinness Record
of caffeine consumption?

04:28.400 --> 04:31.733
- That's, like, your fifth this morning.
- Every time I close my eyes...

04:31.903 --> 04:34.371
...Lucifer is yelling into my head.

04:34.539 --> 04:36.837
I let him in once,
now I can't get rid of him.

04:37.008 --> 04:40.000
- You know, he's not actually...
- Yeah, no, I know.

04:40.178 --> 04:42.612
Um, try telling that to the volume control
in my brain.

04:42.781 --> 04:44.248
Did you try the hand thing?

04:45.683 --> 04:48.743
Yeah. Anyway, long as I'm awake,
check it out.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.753
They're saying drugs,
but read between the lines.

04:51.923 --> 04:55.256
Sounds like she danced her own feet off.
Might be our kind of thing.

04:55.427 --> 04:58.419
Dancers, they are toe shoes full of crazy.

04:58.596 --> 05:03.590
<i>- Heh. And you would know this how?
- I saw Black Swan. Twice.</i>

05:05.670 --> 05:08.298
Hot tutu-on-tutu action.
Come on, what's wrong with you?

05:08.473 --> 05:11.203
Wow, the depths of your...

05:12.043 --> 05:14.773
Ugh, anyway, it's in Portland,
couple hours away.

05:14.946 --> 05:17.710
- What do you think?
- Yeah. Dancers. Why not?

05:18.316 --> 05:20.181
Maybe you'll get some sleep on the way.

05:20.351 --> 05:22.251
Heh. Yeah, maybe.

05:27.392 --> 05:31.260
So the usual, no EMF of sulfur,
no hex junk.

05:31.429 --> 05:34.330
If there's no dancers to interview,
trip could be a bust.

05:35.266 --> 05:38.599
- I hear they have good coffee in Portland.
- Dude, that's Seattle.

05:38.770 --> 05:42.501
- Let's just get the drill over with.
- Ahem.

05:45.777 --> 05:49.645
Yeah, I'll check. Thank you. Okay, later.

05:50.148 --> 05:52.480
- Hi.
- Yeah?

05:52.650 --> 05:54.481
Uh, we'd like to see crime scene photos...

05:54.652 --> 05:56.586
...from the Irena Koganzon case, please.

05:57.288 --> 05:58.653
And you would be?

05:58.823 --> 05:59.983
Oh.

06:04.529 --> 06:07.930
- Give me a minute.
- Take your time.

06:17.675 --> 06:21.338
No, you can't touch those, honey.
Those are for daddy's work.

06:36.961 --> 06:40.397
Daddy, I have to go pee.

06:41.466 --> 06:45.266
Sweetie, you know
where the little girls' room is.

06:59.284 --> 07:00.376
I'd call that weird.

07:47.565 --> 07:49.897
Hey, there. How you doing?

07:50.068 --> 07:52.901
- Okay. What can I do for you?
- We need to see the shoes...

07:53.071 --> 07:55.596
...that were involved
in the ballet dancer's death.

07:55.773 --> 07:59.368
Didn't figure that would be an FBI deal.
But sure, yeah, right here.

08:02.247 --> 08:03.475
Damn it, Tracy.

08:03.648 --> 08:08.745
- Who's Tracy?
- My daughter, she loves ballet.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.925
Hey, take those shoes off.

08:25.370 --> 08:28.168
- Dean, get the shoes.
- I'm trying.

08:31.009 --> 08:32.236
Sorry!

08:33.244 --> 08:34.768
- Come on, Dean!
- I'm trying.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.880
Sorry!

08:43.621 --> 08:45.680
- I got it.
- Ah. Okay.

08:47.358 --> 08:50.486
- I'm going with cursed object.
- You think?

08:51.429 --> 08:53.124
You okay?

08:53.765 --> 08:55.096
Next stop:

08:57.635 --> 09:00.331
Suppose it's too much to hope
shoes are the only thing...

09:00.505 --> 09:04.407
...in that store to worry about.
Oh, what a dreamer you are.

09:16.187 --> 09:17.677
Hey.

09:18.990 --> 09:21.049
Didn't we put those in the trunk?

09:24.862 --> 09:27.160
- How did they...?
- Cursed object, Sam.

09:30.201 --> 09:34.501
- Do they look like they're your size?
- Shut up.

09:35.340 --> 09:36.830
Wait, are you...?

09:37.008 --> 09:39.977
Getting the urge
to Prince Siegfried myself into oblivion?

09:42.146 --> 09:45.479
<i>- Yes.
- You really did see Black Swan.</i>

09:49.187 --> 09:51.314
Well, it was nice seeing you,
Mr. Marshall.

09:51.489 --> 09:53.855
Call me if you have any questions
about the offer.

09:54.025 --> 09:55.583
I'll let you know.

10:00.832 --> 10:02.561
I don't think he's gonna sell.

10:02.734 --> 10:05.362
Thinking is not your strong suit, George.

10:08.973 --> 10:09.997
George?

10:11.976 --> 10:13.739
The door.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.730
Hello?

10:44.742 --> 10:47.609
- Hey, did you sell these?
- Uh, yeah.

10:47.779 --> 10:51.545
- Where did you get them?
- Um, my mother had them in that box.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.018
I don't understand, what's happening?

11:03.327 --> 11:05.318
This, in here?

11:06.931 --> 11:09.525
Hey, hey, hey. Jeez.

11:11.169 --> 11:13.399
You okay there, Baryshnikov?

11:14.071 --> 11:17.632
<i>Yeah, yeah, I'm pas de done.</i>

11:17.809 --> 11:21.575
If it's not too much trouble, do
you mind telling me, uh, what's going on?

11:24.315 --> 11:27.580
- What's your name?
- Uh, uh, Scott Freeman.

11:28.119 --> 11:29.780
You said these were your mother's?

11:29.954 --> 11:33.481
- Where did she get them?
- I don't know. I found them in the back.

11:33.658 --> 11:34.955
I got it.

11:35.126 --> 11:39.756
- Now, where is your mother?
- She, uh, passed away last week.

11:42.300 --> 11:46.703
I'm sorry to hear that.
Scott, listen, these shoes...

11:47.338 --> 11:50.830
Just some personal stuff she collected.
I'm trying to get rid of it all.

11:51.442 --> 11:53.637
- All? Is there more like this?
- Sam.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.948
Scott, what was in those boxes?

13:06.384 --> 13:08.750
Okay, what the hell kind of
FBI guys are you?

13:08.920 --> 13:11.753
The kind that are trying to fix
the mess you started.

13:11.923 --> 13:13.891
Now, where'd your mom get these?

13:14.058 --> 13:16.754
I don't know. I found them in her safe.

13:17.695 --> 13:21.096
Ever occur to you that these things
might be in that safe for a reason?

13:21.265 --> 13:24.928
I just thought it was some of the junk
that she collected over the years.

13:25.102 --> 13:27.468
I knew was into weird stuff,
but I never thought...

13:27.672 --> 13:29.037
Yeah, well, think again.

13:29.206 --> 13:33.233
- Because this junk is killing people.
- What? How can that be?

13:33.411 --> 13:36.642
Scott, we need to know exactly
what you sold out of that safe...

13:36.814 --> 13:39.783
...and the names and addresses
of who you sold it to.

13:50.795 --> 13:53.127
- What do we got?
- She bought a tea kettle.

13:53.965 --> 13:55.557
- Tea kettle.
- Yeah.

13:55.733 --> 13:59.635
Enough curse mojo, you can turn a pencil
into a weapon of mass destruction.

13:59.804 --> 14:01.237
Good times.

14:23.928 --> 14:25.987
You better call this in.

14:27.732 --> 14:31.327
Hello. Yeah. I'd like to report an accident
at 23, Gorham Road.

14:31.969 --> 14:33.766
My name? Uh...

14:35.606 --> 14:36.630
Bruce Hornsby.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.605
All right. Who's next on the list?

14:42.780 --> 14:44.270
All right. Ahem.

14:44.448 --> 14:48.282
We got a, uh, gramophone
sold to Brenda Gluck, 413 River Street.

14:48.452 --> 14:51.819
And a vintage gentleman's magazine
sold to a Peter Yankit...

14:51.989 --> 14:53.388
...27 Johnson Lane.
Really?

14:53.557 --> 14:55.354
- Yeah.
- All right, we better split up.

14:55.526 --> 14:58.359
Why don't you take the gramophone,
I'll handle the old rag.

14:58.529 --> 15:01.987
I wouldn't really handle it if I were you.
Remember those shoes.

15:02.166 --> 15:04.327
Oh, yeah. How could I forget?

15:05.836 --> 15:08.862
You know,
I wonder how old porn kills you.

15:09.206 --> 15:12.039
- Pretty sure you don't wanna know.
- You're probably right.

15:12.209 --> 15:14.143
- All right, let's do this.
- Yep.

15:29.193 --> 15:31.923
I'm gonna run these upstairs.
I'll be right back.

15:32.096 --> 15:33.427
Uh-huh.

15:41.839 --> 15:45.172
<i>Hey, Timmy.</i>

15:53.551 --> 15:57.248
<i>Hey, Timmy. Come here.</i>

15:59.323 --> 16:02.417
<i>I have a secret for you.</i>

16:02.593 --> 16:06.723
<i>Hey, Timmy. Come here.</i>

16:09.266 --> 16:12.099
<i>Hey, Timmy.</i>

16:14.605 --> 16:16.835
<i>Timmy.</i>

16:17.341 --> 16:19.070
<i>Come here.</i>

16:20.444 --> 16:22.105
<i>Timmy.</i>

17:19.703 --> 17:20.829
Where's the gramophone?

17:32.483 --> 17:34.474
Hey, that's mine.

17:35.352 --> 17:38.185
Kid, this would be a good time
for a lesson in gratitude.

17:38.355 --> 17:41.119
Lucky for you, I'm too tired.

17:50.534 --> 17:51.831
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

17:52.002 --> 17:54.562
Got the porn. Just in time too.

17:54.738 --> 17:57.730
<i>- What was he doing?
- Uh, like you said, you don't wanna know.</i>

17:58.475 --> 18:01.000
<i>- Where you at?
- I just got the gramophone.</i>

18:01.178 --> 18:03.669
I'm across town, I'll head your way.

18:14.158 --> 18:17.025
So my mom wasn't
just some whack job...

18:17.194 --> 18:19.253
...and all this stuff is real?

18:20.598 --> 18:24.659
- Yup.
- Well, now, I really feel like crap.

18:25.202 --> 18:29.104
- How come?
- I kept pushing her to sell the store.

18:29.273 --> 18:32.208
She kept saying no,
and I kept pushing her.

18:32.376 --> 18:34.936
You know, telling her
how much money she'd make.

18:35.112 --> 18:38.604
- You think you changed her mind?
- I don't know.

18:38.782 --> 18:41.683
This real estate lady
kept coming around and then one day...

18:41.852 --> 18:43.979
...just like that, mom says okay.

18:44.521 --> 18:49.083
Then she had that accident,
and never even got to enjoy the money.

18:50.060 --> 18:51.084
How soon after?

18:52.897 --> 18:55.388
- The next day.
- The...

18:55.900 --> 18:58.266
- How did she die?
- Car crash.

18:59.203 --> 19:02.434
You know, I keep thinking
if I hadn't pushed her, then...

19:03.107 --> 19:04.870
Yeah, a little tip. Uh...

19:05.743 --> 19:08.268
Feeling guilty
ain't gonna bring them back.

19:08.746 --> 19:10.577
Best you can do is...

19:10.748 --> 19:14.650
...live your life the way that you think
would make her proud.

19:14.818 --> 19:17.082
Or at least not embarrass
the crap out of her.

19:21.325 --> 19:23.384
Oh, uh...

19:23.560 --> 19:26.552
You know the drill, right?
Don't touch those boxes.

19:26.730 --> 19:30.063
Don't go near the safe. Once we get it
boxed up, we'll get a U-Haul...

19:30.234 --> 19:32.896
...get everything out of here.
Believe me, I got it.

20:18.849 --> 20:23.047
You know, Mr. Marshall,
the block won't be the same.

20:23.220 --> 20:26.018
Most of your neighbors
have already sold.

20:26.190 --> 20:30.388
Now, I've prepared
an analysis report for you.

20:30.594 --> 20:32.528
George?

20:34.198 --> 20:37.861
Not this one, George. Mr. Marshall's.

20:41.238 --> 20:44.002
Hard to find good help these days.

20:45.209 --> 20:50.909
Anyway, as you can see,
our offer is more than generous.

20:53.417 --> 20:55.578
- Seems that way.
- With that generous offer...

20:55.753 --> 20:59.712
...you can pretty much go wherever,
and do whatever you please.

20:59.890 --> 21:02.120
You can get on with your life.

21:05.929 --> 21:07.726
You know, Ms. Bicklebee...

21:07.898 --> 21:10.560
...I came here tonight
with every intention of selling.

21:10.734 --> 21:13.430
But what you just said
about getting on with my life?

21:13.637 --> 21:15.764
That store is my life.

21:16.673 --> 21:18.004
I can't sell.

21:22.279 --> 21:26.010
Look, we all feel attached to our past...

21:26.183 --> 21:28.549
...but it's the future
that's the real adventure...

21:28.719 --> 21:34.715
Sorry, not selling.
And I ain't buying that crap either, lady.

21:38.262 --> 21:43.165
Well, if that's your decision,
what can I say? Heh.

21:44.568 --> 21:47.594
I wish you the best of luck
with the rest your life.

21:47.771 --> 21:49.568
What little there is left of it.

22:11.095 --> 22:13.461
See, as promised.

22:15.699 --> 22:17.496
On the dotted line.

22:20.838 --> 22:22.430
What?

22:22.840 --> 22:26.435
Well, maybe you were
a little quick on the trigger.

22:27.744 --> 22:30.178
First, the woman at the antique shop,
and now this.

22:30.347 --> 22:34.340
You know that Mr. Roman doesn't
like us calling attention to ourselves...

22:41.024 --> 22:45.757
- So, what should I do with the body?
- There, that's the attitude.

22:46.930 --> 22:51.492
Okay, take Mr. Marshall
and his stinky cigar home...

22:51.668 --> 22:53.966
...and put them in bed.

22:54.138 --> 22:55.298
Oh, and George...

22:56.507 --> 22:58.372
...make sure the cigar is lit.

22:58.876 --> 23:01.242
You know, burning hot.

23:10.187 --> 23:12.052
There goes Mr. Marshall.

23:12.256 --> 23:16.056
Should've quit smoking,
can be hazardous to your health.

23:27.671 --> 23:32.301
Do you know how many assistants
I've had since taking this body, George?

23:33.477 --> 23:35.377
- Maybe three?
- Five.

23:37.648 --> 23:40.981
I leave it to your imagination
what happened to the first four.

23:43.887 --> 23:47.789
- Is something wrong with the brew?
- You tell me. What did I ask for?

23:48.492 --> 23:52.019
- A hot cup of coffee?
- That's right.

23:52.196 --> 23:53.356
Got the coffee part.

23:54.198 --> 23:58.567
But did I say hot, or, I don't know, tepid?

23:59.736 --> 24:03.001
Four, George. Just saying.

24:04.341 --> 24:06.400
So go to that nice barista on Main...

24:06.577 --> 24:09.512
...and get me a grande, non-fat,
no-whip, white mocha...

24:09.680 --> 24:12.308
...one pump sugar-free,
double-shot espresso, okay?

24:13.584 --> 24:16.951
Sure, uh, but that's all
the way across town.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.612
- Okay. See you at 8:45.
- I won't be back till 9.

24:50.220 --> 24:51.710
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way.

24:51.888 --> 24:54.686
Yeah, not sure we're taking the safe
out of town just yet.

24:54.858 --> 24:56.223
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

24:56.393 --> 25:01.057
Um, so it turns out that Mama Hoarder didn't
just die and leave the store to Scott.

25:02.132 --> 25:04.464
- She didn't?
- No. Listen. Lady spends 40 years...

25:04.635 --> 25:06.398
...trying to keep that place, right?

25:06.570 --> 25:10.165
Then one day, she wakes up and sells.
Next day, drives her car off a cliff.

25:10.807 --> 25:14.470
So, uh, what, you think somebody
cut her brakes or something?

25:14.645 --> 25:17.273
I think the world is
full of hilarious coincidences.

25:17.447 --> 25:21.474
Oh, and there's this new company,
never even tasted real estate...

25:21.652 --> 25:23.813
...just gobbled up a chunk of Main Street.

25:23.987 --> 25:27.514
Now, I could be off the deep end here,
but doesn't that seem weird to you?

25:30.260 --> 25:31.284
Sam?

25:32.029 --> 25:33.587
<i>Sam?</i>

25:33.764 --> 25:35.857
Yeah, yeah.
Sounds good, keep me posted.

25:36.033 --> 25:39.628
<i>- Sounds good? Are you all right?
- You know how they say that, uh...</i>

25:39.803 --> 25:42.704
...sleep deprivation is
an enhanced interrogation technique?

25:42.906 --> 25:44.168
Yeah.

25:44.341 --> 25:45.467
Trust me, it's torture.

25:56.753 --> 25:58.152
Son of a bitch.

26:09.366 --> 26:11.027
<i>- This better be good.
- Frank.</i>

26:11.201 --> 26:14.227
<i>I don't mean to double-dip
in your crazy sauce, no offense.</i>

26:14.438 --> 26:15.564
None taken, fudge-pop.

26:15.739 --> 26:17.366
But I think I found something.

26:20.043 --> 26:21.977
My silence is your cue, Dean.

26:23.046 --> 26:26.482
There's this new company buying up
a bunch of mom-and-pops in Portland.

26:26.650 --> 26:28.982
I hit a firewall
when I tried to access its site.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.848
<i>- Think you can crack it?
- Can a dog play poker?</i>

26:33.023 --> 26:34.820
- I don't...
- The answer is yes.

26:34.991 --> 26:38.188
- What's the company name?
- Uh, Geo Thrive Inc.

27:30.547 --> 27:31.946
Wait!

27:32.115 --> 27:34.140
I said one pump sugar-free, not two.

27:34.317 --> 27:35.875
Extra pump's on the house.

27:36.953 --> 27:39.444
That's nice, but my boss
is gonna be able to tell...

27:39.623 --> 27:42.319
...okay, so, please,
just make me a new one.

27:42.926 --> 27:46.123
There's people in line,
and I'm here all alone, so...

27:46.296 --> 27:47.422
...enjoy the free pump.

27:48.265 --> 27:50.665
How about make me a new one.

27:50.834 --> 27:52.631
How about you eat me.

27:54.438 --> 27:56.099
Don't tempt me.

28:01.812 --> 28:04.975
- You're lucky I'm late.
- So lucky. Next.

28:05.148 --> 28:08.140
Can I get, uh, a triple red-eye, please?

28:08.318 --> 28:10.149
It's your funeral.

28:22.065 --> 28:23.896
<i>What are you talking about, George?</i>

28:24.067 --> 28:25.125
<i>Where's my coffee?</i>

28:25.302 --> 28:27.031
I am seriously not kidding.

28:27.204 --> 28:29.297
- You're sure it's him?
- Of course, I'm sure.

28:29.473 --> 28:33.102
Sam Winchester is going into
that antique shop we just bought.

28:35.712 --> 28:38.545
- You think they're here for us?
- No. Trust me.

28:38.715 --> 28:41.013
Heh. If the Winchesters were here for us,
we'd know.

28:42.953 --> 28:45.046
<i>- I am going to enjoy this.
- Enjoy?</i>

28:45.222 --> 28:46.655
Enjoy what, George?

28:47.524 --> 28:50.459
Well, eating him
is pretty much what I was thinking.

28:50.627 --> 28:53.118
- What? No.
- No?

28:53.296 --> 28:56.060
Come back to the office. Now.

28:56.233 --> 28:59.361
We have a chain of command here,
George.

28:59.536 --> 29:02.801
You see a Winchester, you don't eat him.

29:02.973 --> 29:05.806
You tell me, and I eat him.

29:05.976 --> 29:10.379
What, do you think I'm gonna tell Dick,
"I think he ate him but I didn't see it?"

29:10.547 --> 29:13.914
What, I'm supposed to vouch
for you, George?

29:14.117 --> 29:18.383
Like you're not one dumb move away
from a bibbing already? Come on.

29:18.555 --> 29:20.682
- But l...
- Oh, no.

29:24.227 --> 29:25.751
- But...
- No!

29:26.363 --> 29:28.126
No, no, no.

29:28.298 --> 29:29.788
Hup!

29:39.409 --> 29:40.535
Oh!

29:40.710 --> 29:42.405
Two pumps.

29:42.579 --> 29:43.705
Really, George?

29:49.853 --> 29:52.048
Frank. Tell me you got something.

29:52.222 --> 29:55.851
No, I'm calling
with the Lakers-Celtics score.

29:56.359 --> 29:58.850
- What?
- Of course, I got something.

29:59.029 --> 30:01.964
I figured out why you hit that firewall.

30:05.168 --> 30:06.760
My silence is your cue, Frank.

30:06.937 --> 30:08.768
Oh-ho-ho. Touché.

30:08.939 --> 30:11.635
You were trying to access
the Geo Thrive internal site...

30:11.808 --> 30:15.437
...and the reason why you couldn't is
because if you dig down deep...

30:15.612 --> 30:17.204
...it's all Dick.

30:17.981 --> 30:20.313
Helpful, if you didn't say
that about everything.

30:20.483 --> 30:23.577
Yeah, except I'm operating
on hard fact now, wiseass.

30:23.753 --> 30:26.085
You telling me Geo Thrive
is part of Roman Inc?

30:26.256 --> 30:29.623
It's a conglomerate within a subsidiary
within a conglomerate.

30:29.793 --> 30:32.057
- It's all tied together, Dean.
- Okay. So, what?

30:32.228 --> 30:35.163
Leviathans are Wal-Marting
mom-and-pops?

30:35.332 --> 30:37.459
And Bingo was his name-o.
Aah!

30:37.634 --> 30:39.966
So we've got a big old field
in Wisconsin...

30:40.136 --> 30:44.630
...and a bunch of frigging shops
in Portland, what the hell are they up to?

30:44.808 --> 30:48.505
Beats me, all I know is it's corporate
and smelly as the day is long.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.903
If I were you,
I'd get out of Dodge, pronto.

30:52.082 --> 30:55.108
- People are dying here, Frank.
- Sure, every second.

30:55.285 --> 30:58.777
Check the obesity stats,
that town ain't nothing special.

30:58.955 --> 31:01.856
We're not done here, okay?
And we might get some answers.

31:02.025 --> 31:05.984
Fine. Call me if you don't die.

31:07.797 --> 31:10.129
- So?
- That'll work.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.734
Uh, how's it going?

31:13.370 --> 31:15.031
Just got off the phone with Frank.

31:15.238 --> 31:18.105
Apparently, we have a bit of
a Leviathan issue in this town.

31:18.274 --> 31:20.333
- Leviathans, here?
- Yeah.

31:20.510 --> 31:24.105
We're looking at a big old
giant nesting doll of Dick...

31:24.280 --> 31:26.373
...as far as property sales go.

31:30.620 --> 31:35.114
- Hey, you hearing me?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

31:35.659 --> 31:38.150
Okay, you know what?
Enough with the insomnia crap...

31:38.328 --> 31:40.694
...all right, Pacino? You need to crash.

31:40.864 --> 31:44.766
I'll keep working, you find a motel
and get some sleep, okay?

31:45.502 --> 31:47.970
It doesn't matter what I do, Dean.

31:48.538 --> 31:50.506
Lucifer will not shut up.

31:52.909 --> 31:54.672
Even now?

31:54.844 --> 31:57.369
He's singing "Stairway to Heaven"
right now.

31:58.148 --> 32:00.241
- Good song.
- Not 50 times in a row.

32:00.417 --> 32:01.577
Huh.

32:10.093 --> 32:13.688
- Hey, Scott.
- Please, Sam, you gotta help me.

32:13.863 --> 32:14.921
What's happening?

32:15.098 --> 32:18.226
I looked in one of my mom's mirrors
I wanna rip my face off.

32:18.401 --> 32:20.869
<i>- It was cursed.
- Hold tight. Uh, we're on our way.</i>

32:21.571 --> 32:23.835
He touched something
he was not supposed to.

32:24.007 --> 32:25.497
Of course, he did.

32:32.115 --> 32:35.448
Was, uh, that okay?

32:36.419 --> 32:39.252
Well, not exactly Oscar-worthy, but...

32:41.524 --> 32:42.718
...I was convinced.

32:44.060 --> 32:46.051
Not that it matters...

32:46.229 --> 32:48.891
...because you don't have any more lines.

32:53.036 --> 32:54.697
Now what?

32:54.871 --> 32:58.272
Now we wait for meal service.

33:11.654 --> 33:17.115
So, um, one more body
we're gonna have to spirit away, huh?

33:17.293 --> 33:19.989
Actually, no.
As you so helpfully pointed out earlier...

33:20.163 --> 33:22.791
...Dick doesn't like making the papers.

33:22.966 --> 33:26.231
Well, right, so, what's the plan?

33:26.402 --> 33:29.462
Well, we can't have Scott here
running his mouth.

33:29.639 --> 33:34.133
Loose lips, yada, yada, yada.
We will kill him.

33:38.314 --> 33:41.579
But that doesn't mean
anyone ever has to notice he's dead.

33:44.788 --> 33:46.085
Pack your bags, Georgie.

33:47.891 --> 33:51.190
You are turning into one Scott Freeman...

33:51.394 --> 33:53.589
...for the next, oh...

33:54.030 --> 33:55.691
...30 some odd years.

33:56.266 --> 33:57.460
Right, Scotty?

34:20.989 --> 34:24.482
- So much for the cursed mirror.
- Sam and Dean.

34:24.661 --> 34:27.960
It is such a pleasure
to make your acquaintances.

34:28.130 --> 34:32.158
Now, just so you can put names
to the faces that'll be eating you...

34:32.335 --> 34:35.862
...I'm Joyce,
and this is my assistant George.

34:36.973 --> 34:39.533
Wait. You're the lady
from the real estate signs.

34:39.708 --> 34:42.007
Yes. You like my photo?

34:42.178 --> 34:44.009
Ah, you might wanna lay off
the whitening strips.

34:46.583 --> 34:47.914
Oh, Dean.

34:48.083 --> 34:52.145
I am gonna enjoy
picking you out of my teeth.

35:08.504 --> 35:11.735
There's a bucket of that stuff
you love throwing at us right there.

35:15.278 --> 35:16.711
Dunk me before she sees.

35:30.393 --> 35:31.417
The sword.

35:33.396 --> 35:35.296
The sword!

35:53.249 --> 35:55.080
Thanks.

36:05.261 --> 36:07.991
Okay, I get that these things
mean business, you know...

36:08.164 --> 36:12.464
...but I can't just, like, uproot my life.
Ah, sure, you can.

36:12.635 --> 36:14.899
It's not as hard as you think.

36:19.575 --> 36:22.806
Look, Scott, these big-mouths
don't like to leave loose ends.

36:22.979 --> 36:26.813
Don't look back until you get some place
where you don't speak the language.

36:26.983 --> 36:28.177
All right, I'm going.

36:30.787 --> 36:33.085
Thank you, I guess.

36:33.656 --> 36:35.487
Don't mention it.

36:37.493 --> 36:38.790
One minute.

36:38.962 --> 36:41.863
That's how long you have to explain
to use why you helped us.

36:43.132 --> 36:47.569
Because I am dying to know
what that bitch tastes like.

36:48.938 --> 36:52.499
Wait. Let me get this straight.
You want to eat your boss?

36:53.309 --> 36:55.641
You got a better way
to make her stay dead?

36:57.013 --> 36:59.607
So, what, so now you're
on our side or something?

37:01.317 --> 37:03.148
Yeah. No.

37:04.020 --> 37:05.715
But if Joyce is alive...

37:05.888 --> 37:08.982
...then I spend the rest of my life
cleaning her messes.

37:09.158 --> 37:10.716
Or worse, I get eaten.

37:11.694 --> 37:15.095
Or bibbed. Ugh!

37:15.465 --> 37:19.333
So thanks for chopping her head off
for me.

37:19.502 --> 37:21.299
Taking her on solo? Yikes. Heh.

37:21.471 --> 37:27.899
So really, mm, thanks for the assist there.
And, of course, you're welcome.

37:28.978 --> 37:30.536
For saving you.

37:31.114 --> 37:34.413
Before she ripped into your ass
like a Christmas present.

37:35.451 --> 37:37.180
Tsk. Win-win, right?

37:37.687 --> 37:41.555
So, uh, ahem, how about that head?

37:47.263 --> 37:49.561
Yeah, not gonna happen, Georgie.

37:50.666 --> 37:55.330
Now, what the hell
is Dick Roman building in Wisconsin?

37:56.205 --> 37:59.174
I don't know.
I barely know where Wisconsin is.

37:59.342 --> 38:00.866
I'm a west-coast representative.

38:01.044 --> 38:03.103
Gonna keep killing people
who don't sign?

38:03.279 --> 38:05.213
All right, take it easy.

38:08.117 --> 38:11.280
- Hmm.
- Killing people isn't part of the agenda.

38:11.454 --> 38:15.049
Joyce just kept getting impatient.
You got nothing to worry about with me.

38:16.793 --> 38:19.853
Don't you get it? You guys
are freaking about the wrong thing.

38:20.029 --> 38:21.587
- Oh, you think?
- Real estate deals?

38:21.764 --> 38:26.167
Come on. Big picture, guys.
You think it's just here?

38:26.769 --> 38:29.067
It's everywhere.

38:29.238 --> 38:31.866
And it's a lot more ambitious
than this little project.

38:33.576 --> 38:36.568
My advice, keep your heads down,
and stay down.

38:38.681 --> 38:40.615
Listen to me, you gooey son of a bitch...

38:41.818 --> 38:44.878
...you're gonna tell us
what you're building here...

38:45.054 --> 38:47.887
...or I'm gonna wash your mouth out
with soap.

38:51.327 --> 38:53.921
Well, I was hoping we could play nice.

38:56.499 --> 38:57.830
But if you must know...

38:59.402 --> 39:02.929
...it's going to be a research center.
Research for what?

39:05.408 --> 39:07.103
Disease.

39:07.643 --> 39:12.842
This, gentlemen,
is where we are going to cure cancer.

39:15.785 --> 39:18.015
Wait, that doesn't make any sense. Heh.

39:18.588 --> 39:21.751
I mean, why would Dick Roman
wanna cure cancer?

39:22.792 --> 39:25.590
Because we're only here to help.

39:35.171 --> 39:37.162
Ah, monsters cure cancer.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.508
- A sentence I never thought I'd say.
- Heh.

39:40.676 --> 39:42.644
Why does it make me so nervous?

39:42.812 --> 39:46.179
Yeah, I hear you.
So, what do we do now?

39:47.450 --> 39:49.247
- You're gonna sleep on it.
- Heh.

39:49.418 --> 39:50.715
All the way to Frank's.

39:50.887 --> 39:52.980
- Capiche?
- I wish I could.

39:53.789 --> 39:58.522
- Did you get any sleep last night?
- Yeah, yeah. A little. I don't know.

39:58.694 --> 40:01.822
We'll find you a soft rock station.
Always knocks you right out.

40:32.395 --> 40:34.420
<i>Don't go around tonight</i>

40:34.597 --> 40:37.623
<i>Well, it's bound to take your life</i>

40:37.800 --> 40:42.965
<i>There's a bad moon on the rise</i>

40:43.139 --> 40:45.437
<i>I hear hurricanes a-blowing</i>

40:45.608 --> 40:47.269
Hey, Frank!

40:48.644 --> 40:50.703
Hey, Deveraux!

40:53.583 --> 40:56.017
What the hell is he doing in there?

40:56.185 --> 40:57.948
Frank!

40:59.355 --> 41:02.051
Don't shoot, we're coming in.

41:07.063 --> 41:11.056
<i>Well, it's bound to take your life</i>

41:11.234 --> 41:13.327
<i>There's a bad moon on the rise.</i>

41:14.203 --> 41:16.831
<i>All right</i>

41:28.351 --> 41:30.080
Not good.

41:31.153 --> 41:35.385
<i>There's a bad moon on the rise</i>
