Hurry up, Balki.
We’re gonna be late for work.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.728
Oh, just a minute, cousin

01:34.761 --> 01:37.564
I’m‐I’m almost finished
with my breakfast.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.536
[screams]

01:47.874 --> 01:49.275
Is something wrong?

01:51.377 --> 01:52.679
No.

01:54.414 --> 01:55.549
Why?

01:55.582 --> 01:56.850
You screamed.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.451
Oh‐ho‐ho, that!

01:58.484 --> 02:00.754
Well, um, as a matter of fact

02:00.787 --> 02:03.824
I do have a little pain
in my tooth, but it’s nothing.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.193
Well, it doesn’t sound
like nothing.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.530
What does it feel like?

02:09.562 --> 02:12.265
Well, ahem. It‐it feels like

02:12.298 --> 02:14.601
someone is hammering

02:14.635 --> 02:16.670
a huge nail...

02:18.204 --> 02:21.542
...up...inside my head...

02:24.244 --> 02:27.480
...and...twisting it...

‐I got it.
‐...and turning it.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.618
I got it, I got the picture.
I got the picture.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.221
Balki, buddy, it sounds
like you’ve got a cavity.

02:35.255 --> 02:37.390
A cavity is a hole
in your tooth.

02:37.423 --> 02:38.725
When we get to the office
I’ll call and make

02:38.759 --> 02:40.293
an appointment for you
with my dentist.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.530
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, sir.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.331
I’m not going to no dentist.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.333
I’ll go on a liquid diet

02:47.367 --> 02:49.536
I’ll have my jaw hot‐wired

02:49.570 --> 02:51.437
but I’m not going to no dentist

02:51.471 --> 02:53.574
not no way, not no how.

02:54.541 --> 02:55.809
Oh, you would love it.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.579
Oh, it’s too bad
you don’t wanna go.

02:58.612 --> 03:02.448
’Cause they let you sit in a
chair that goes up and down.

03:02.482 --> 03:03.550
Really?

03:03.584 --> 03:04.651
Oh, and they spray water

03:04.685 --> 03:05.719
in your mouth.

03:05.752 --> 03:06.687
They do?

03:06.720 --> 03:09.690
And when you leave
they give you balloons!

03:09.723 --> 03:11.992
Oh, a trip to the dentist
is like a visit

03:12.025 --> 03:14.427
to the amusement park.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.530
It’s too bad
you don’t wanna go.

03:17.564 --> 03:19.600
I want to go to the dentist!

03:21.401 --> 03:23.504
Well...okay, we’ll make
an appointment for you.

Aren’t you supposed to be making
your afternoon deliveries?

03:44.024 --> 03:45.959
I finished, Mr. Gorpley.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.628
Aren’t you supposed to be
sorting the mail?

03:47.661 --> 03:48.695
I finished.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.863
I want to be all ready

03:49.896 --> 03:51.632
when Cousin Larry
comes out and says

03:51.665 --> 03:54.768
"It’s time to go
to the dentist!"

03:58.905 --> 04:01.608
You’re in a hurry
to go to the dentist?

04:01.642 --> 04:05.946
Cousin Larry says it’s more fun
than an amusement park.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.915
Well, actually, it’s more
like the House of Horrors.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.852
[laughing]

04:13.920 --> 04:17.558
Especially when
you see...the drill.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.663
Cousin Larry didn’t mention...

04:22.696 --> 04:23.730
...the drill.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.634
The drill is the
greatest instrument

04:27.668 --> 04:29.903
of torture since alimony.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.809
The dentist uses it
to drill holes in your teeth.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.479
Well, ain’t I the lucky one?

04:40.380 --> 04:41.682
I won’t be needing the drill

04:41.715 --> 04:44.417
because I already got a hole
in my tooth.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.653
See? See that?

04:46.687 --> 04:47.821
See that?

04:48.922 --> 04:50.524
Lovely.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.961
Well, just wait until
the dentist uses the drill

04:54.995 --> 04:57.397
to make that hole bigger

04:57.430 --> 04:58.899
and deeper

04:58.932 --> 05:01.535
and wider...and...

of dental college.

Well, have fun, Bartokomous,
I’m going to lunch.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.796
Tooth bothering you, Balki?

05:31.798 --> 05:33.934
You didn’t tell me
about the drill.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.438
‐Who told you about the drill?
‐Mr. Gorpley.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.974
He tell me that the dentist
is going to take a drill

05:41.007 --> 05:44.711
and make the hole in my tooth
bigger and wider and deeper

05:44.745 --> 05:47.480
and that it’s going to hurt
more than alimony.

05:49.983 --> 05:53.820
And we all remember
what happened at the alimony.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.559
Did Mr. Gorpley scare you?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.460
‐Well, he‐‐
‐Did he scare you?

06:00.493 --> 06:03.997
Are you scared...
Are you scared of the dentist?

06:04.030 --> 06:08.468
No, I’m not scared
of the dentist

06:08.502 --> 06:10.637
scared of the dentist.

06:10.671 --> 06:14.775
However...I’ve decided

06:14.808 --> 06:17.010
that I don’t need

06:17.043 --> 06:19.412
to go to the dentist.

06:19.445 --> 06:22.616
I can learn to live
with the pain.

‐You can live with the pain?
‐Yes!

06:24.618 --> 06:25.886
[screams]

06:28.088 --> 06:30.123
You can’t live with the pain.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.726
Balki, you’ve got to get
your tooth taken care of now.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.962
If you don’t, it’ll only hurt
worse and be harder to fix.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.832
But there’s‐there’s just
one little problem.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.466
‐What’s that?
‐I’m afraid.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.835
Oh...

06:41.868 --> 06:44.805
I know, I know you’re afraid

06:44.838 --> 06:48.775
but‐but I...I wouldn’t
make you do anything

06:48.809 --> 06:50.944
that was bad for you.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.213
Balki, remember the time
you were afraid

06:53.246 --> 06:54.548
to have your picture taken?

06:54.581 --> 06:55.916
Yeah.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.017
’Cause you thought the camera

06:57.050 --> 06:58.652
was gonna steal
part of your soul?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.523
‐Yeah.
‐You remember what I said?

07:02.556 --> 07:05.659
Yeah, you said, "Balki...

07:05.692 --> 07:06.893
...don’t be stupid."

07:09.095 --> 07:10.531
And you remember the time
you were afraid

07:10.564 --> 07:11.798
to get into the elevator?

07:11.832 --> 07:12.899
Yeah.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.200
Because you thought it would
take you to the center

07:14.234 --> 07:15.969
of the earth.

07:19.005 --> 07:22.809
And you said, "Balki...

07:22.843 --> 07:24.444
...don’t be stupid."

07:25.646 --> 07:28.481
And now you ride the elevator
all the time

07:28.515 --> 07:30.751
and that’s what’s happening now.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.622
I’m riding the elevator?

07:35.656 --> 07:37.490
No.

07:37.524 --> 07:39.492

This is his first time
at the dentist.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.804
Oh, I see.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.744
I’m gonna put this little piece
of film in your mouth.

Open up. Ah‐ha.

Bite down gently on the... No!

On the tab

08:36.316 --> 08:38.018

to keep your mouth closed.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.085
‐But‐‐
‐No, no, no!

08:39.119 --> 08:40.186
It’s very important

08:40.220 --> 08:41.988
to keep your mouth closed.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.625
I’m just gonna take some X‐rays
of your tooth.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.762
[Balki mumbling]

08:53.734 --> 08:55.902
What?

08:55.936 --> 08:58.639
He said, "X‐rays?
We didn’t talk about X‐rays."

09:00.073 --> 09:02.008
In this business
you get used to people

09:02.042 --> 09:04.310
talking with stuff
in their mouths.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.913
Well, nothing to worry about.

09:06.947 --> 09:10.150
An X‐ray is an invisible beam
that goes through your face

09:10.183 --> 09:12.819
takes a picture of your tooth,
goes right out the other side.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.824
It’s completely safe.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.193
[mumbling]

09:26.667 --> 09:27.934
What?

09:29.335 --> 09:32.038
He said, "What if the X‐ray
gets stuck in my head

09:32.072 --> 09:34.040
and makes a hole in my brain?"

09:36.843 --> 09:38.144
Trust me.

a good point there.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.003
Uh, I’ll‐I’ll just take this

10:03.036 --> 10:05.872
and, uh, I, I think
I’ll let the doctor

10:05.906 --> 10:08.875
look at him first
and then we’ll take the X‐rays.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.778

You know, you’re really being
a big baby about all this.

sprayer.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.743
Would it be...

11:16.777 --> 11:18.178
...the drill?

11:20.914 --> 11:21.948
Yes, that’s the drill,

11:21.982 --> 11:23.817
but it wont be painful.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.286
It won’t hurt a bit
after you’re shot.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.890
I’m going to be shot?

11:29.923 --> 11:31.892
No, no. No.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.426
Nothing like that.

is just gonna stick a needle

‐I’m out of here.
‐Just stay right there.

Hello, Larry, well, I hear
we have a nervous patient.

Hello, doctor.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.178
This is doctor Dr. Shukin.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.181
Don’t you touch me.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.452
I happen to be trained

11:59.485 --> 12:01.221
in the marital art.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.159
Stop it! Stop it!

12:08.294 --> 12:10.797
He’s never had a cavity before.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.333
Well, let’s take a look.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.136
Now, open wide.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.806
A little wider.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.877
Al‐alright, alright.
Look, I tell you what.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.180
Why don’t I let the doctor
look in my mouth first, okay?

12:27.213 --> 12:31.084
And that way you’ll see that
nothing bad is going to happen.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.288
Alright? Hmm?

12:35.321 --> 12:36.523

12:43.396 --> 12:47.868
Alright, now, open wide.
Tell me if this hurts.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.272
No.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.008
How about this?

12:56.543 --> 13:00.080
No. I told you
it wouldn’t hurt.
