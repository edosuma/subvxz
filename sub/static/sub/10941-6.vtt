00:04.235 --> 00:05.736

Damn.

00:05.803 --> 00:08.371
They're trying to get the mare
to bond with an orphan foal.

Ty:
Well, his name's Merlin.

Uh, um...

00:40.060 --> 00:42.294
Ty was just showing
me the barn swallows.

00:42.361 --> 00:44.062
He says they nested
in the barn.

00:44.130 --> 00:46.664
Well, imagine that.
Barn swallows.

00:46.731 --> 00:49.666
Building a nest.
In a barn.

00:49.734 --> 00:52.235
I guess you heard I'm moving
back to my trailer.

00:52.301 --> 00:53.635

01:01.574 --> 01:04.376
But hey, I can take it.
I got big shoulders.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.550
I haven't seen her in ages.

01:16.617 --> 01:18.218
Lou:
She's super busy right now.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.020
Soraya: Okay, well tell her to drop by.
I miss her.

So?

01:26.758 --> 01:27.491
You got a surprise
for me?

01:27.558 --> 01:28.826
Yes, I do.

01:31.061 --> 01:32.128
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Hey, it's a...</i>

01:32.196 --> 01:33.396
A newspaper article.

01:33.462 --> 01:35.664
Not just any
newspaper article.

01:35.731 --> 01:37.766
It's about
Big Sky Industries

01:37.833 --> 01:41.101
and Richard Chenowith
is here, in Hudson.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.101
Ah-uh.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.068
The CEO/entrepreneur.

01:44.136 --> 01:46.037
The Richard Branson
of the oil world?

01:46.105 --> 01:47.505
Yes.

01:47.571 --> 01:49.673
Listen, they're developing these
new eco-friendly pipelines-

01:49.740 --> 01:50.740
Okay, Lou...

01:50.808 --> 01:52.108
No cracks,
no leakage...

01:52.176 --> 01:53.810
Lou, can you stop
for a second?

01:53.877 --> 01:55.977
Listen, I know that Chenowith
is in town, okay?

01:56.045 --> 01:58.213
But he's in talks
with Pembridge Oil.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.379
It's my number one
competitor.

01:59.447 --> 02:00.714
So? That doesn't mean
you can't have

02:00.781 --> 02:02.048
a meet and greet.

02:02.116 --> 02:03.783
I'd never be able to match
what Pembridge is offering

02:03.849 --> 02:04.883
for distribution rights.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.852
But it's not about money for him
because he's loaded already.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.454
It's about how he connects
with people.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.856
And how could he not connect
with a fabulous guy like you?

02:13.923 --> 02:15.456
Okay, um...

02:15.524 --> 02:17.125
Yeah, you're right.
You know what?

02:17.193 --> 02:18.826
I'll give him a call and see
if I can set up a meeting,

02:18.893 --> 02:20.895
but I guarantee you
he will be booked.

02:20.961 --> 02:22.829
He'll be at the dude ranch
for dinner tomorrow night,

02:22.896 --> 02:24.030
and I've arranged for him

02:24.097 --> 02:26.098
to spend the weekend
as our guest.

02:26.165 --> 02:28.699
Oh, okay, um...
(Laughing)

02:28.765 --> 02:30.466
I kind of figured
you'd say yes.

02:30.534 --> 02:32.368
You know, typically a surprise
from a girlfriend

02:32.435 --> 02:33.768
would be like,
you know, flames tickets,

02:33.838 --> 02:37.606
or cuff links
or something like that.

<i>Bad girl!</i>

02:58.354 --> 03:01.588
She's escaping at night
out of her coop somehow.

03:01.655 --> 03:03.723
Why can't you be like
your sisters Anne and Emily

03:03.790 --> 03:05.324
and just stay put?

03:05.825 --> 03:07.726
But you are a pretty girl.
Yes, you are.

03:09.544 --> 03:11.712
Amy: Mallory, would you
get your butt over here?!

03:11.779 --> 03:14.014
You're not the only one
with a gift, Amy.

03:14.081 --> 03:17.216
You may be a horse whisperer,
but I'm a hen whisperer.

03:17.282 --> 03:18.516

Hey, Merlin.

03:27.557 --> 03:29.057

What is he doing here?

03:29.125 --> 03:30.858
Kit's mare rejected him.

03:30.926 --> 03:32.559
Oh, that's so sad.

03:32.626 --> 03:33.792

<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Ah, she's okay.</i>

But Merlin,

03:37.863 --> 03:39.998
I was hoping he'd be able
to stay here.

03:40.065 --> 03:42.601
Oh, Scott, I don't know.
Lou would kill me.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.535
We're already got
so much to do.

03:44.602 --> 03:45.768

Yeah, but not
an orphaned foal.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.953
of their body weight
every day.

06:17.021 --> 06:18.455

have to be feeding it

every two or three hours
until it's weaned.

06:21.056 --> 06:22.757
And you know this how?

06:22.825 --> 06:24.759
I did a 4H project

"Eco-friendly" oil man.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.356
I'm having a cookout
at the dude ranch

08:50.424 --> 08:51.491
for him tonight,

08:51.558 --> 08:52.692
and I was hoping to show him

08:52.759 --> 08:55.327
some authentic Alberta
hospitality.

08:56.228 --> 08:59.030
I'd like to show him the toe
of my Alberta boot.

08:59.098 --> 09:01.432
I don't suppose you'd like
to meet him?

09:01.499 --> 09:03.332
Jack:
No, I don't suppose I would.

09:03.399 --> 09:05.400
Whatever.
Can you pass that please?

09:05.468 --> 09:06.635
Thank you.
Oh, hey,

09:06.702 --> 09:08.302
Soraya is feeling ignored.

09:08.369 --> 09:09.570
I know. Okay.

09:09.638 --> 09:12.907
I gotta get in town
the next couple days.

09:12.974 --> 09:14.074
Mallory:
I found this at the bookstore.

09:14.141 --> 09:15.174
<i>It's for you two.</i>

09:15.242 --> 09:18.044
It'll help you with Merlin.

09:18.110 --> 09:19.512
"The New Parents'

09:19.513 --> 09:21.912
"guide to Raising a
Healthy, Happy Child".

09:21.980 --> 09:23.480
<i>Dr. Abraham Kirk.</i>

09:23.546 --> 09:25.247
<i>Mallory:</i> <i>Yeah, it was my
mom</i> <i>and dad's Bible.</i>

09:25.315 --> 09:28.851
And, I mean,
look how great I turned out.

09:28.918 --> 09:30.051
Lou:
(Snorting)

09:30.619 --> 09:33.053
Hi, you're still with Merlin?

09:33.120 --> 09:33.886
Every time I leave
him on his own

09:33.954 --> 09:35.320
he starts crying.

09:35.387 --> 09:37.756
Amy:
Right, right, he's crying.

09:37.823 --> 09:39.690
Well it sounds like crying.

09:39.758 --> 09:43.027
You know,
you really shouldn't spoil him.

09:43.094 --> 09:44.260
If you're out here anyway

09:44.328 --> 09:45.795
<i>you might as well start</i>
<i>training him.</i>

09:45.863 --> 09:47.630
Go get a soft halter
from the barn

09:47.636 --> 09:48.497
and leading him around
in the round pen.

09:48.564 --> 09:50.599
A halter already?
He's just a baby.

09:50.665 --> 09:52.866
Well, it's best to start
when they're young!

09:52.934 --> 09:54.434
Besides,
orphaned foals can end up

09:54.501 --> 09:55.968
with a whole bunch
of behavioral problems

09:56.035 --> 09:57.435
if you don't.

09:57.504 --> 10:00.740
Merlin doesn't have
"behavioral problems".

10:00.806 --> 10:01.706
(Horse snorts sharply)

10:01.773 --> 10:03.440
Ow!

10:03.508 --> 10:05.976
Amy:
Yeah, of course he doesn't.

10:07.944 --> 10:09.310
(Truck rumbling)

10:09.978 --> 10:11.411
Peter:
Mr. Chenowith.

10:11.479 --> 10:13.814
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Heard a lot about you.

10:13.914 --> 10:14.881
Peter Morris.

10:14.949 --> 10:16.683
Heard a lot
about you too.

10:16.751 --> 10:18.384
Lou:
Thank you so much for coming.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.417
You must be
Lou Fleming.

10:19.485 --> 10:20.853
That's right.

10:20.919 --> 10:22.620
Did you know that she lied
to my secretary

10:22.687 --> 10:24.420
so I would take
her call?

10:24.487 --> 10:25.855
Said she was from
Pembridge Oil,

10:25.922 --> 10:28.658
had to discuss some urgent
bit of business with me.

10:28.724 --> 10:29.724
Really?

10:29.792 --> 10:31.459
I'm so sorry
about that.

10:31.526 --> 10:32.860
Don't be.

10:32.927 --> 10:34.628
I love a feisty girl
who gets what she wants.

10:34.695 --> 10:35.494
Right, Peter?

10:35.562 --> 10:38.031
(Chuckling)
Yeah, you bet.

10:39.464 --> 10:42.266
(Whispering)
You're feisty.

10:42.333 --> 10:42.967
Ty:
Easy!

10:44.335 --> 10:45.636
(Horse snorts nervously)

10:45.703 --> 10:46.703
Ready?

10:47.203 --> 10:48.270
Keep your head
straight.

10:48.337 --> 10:49.938
(Horse snorting)

10:50.006 --> 10:51.306
(Horse snorting)

10:53.207 --> 10:54.007
(Laughing)

10:55.976 --> 10:57.342
(Horse snorting)

10:57.410 --> 10:58.310
That a boy.

10:59.745 --> 11:02.013
You did your best, Merlin.
I'm proud of you.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.613
Mallory:
Dr. Kirk wouldn't like that.

11:03.683 --> 11:04.849
<i>It says right here:</i>

11:04.916 --> 11:06.684
"Naughty behaviour should
never be rewarded."

11:06.750 --> 11:10.153
Mallory, go whisper to your
hens or something.

11:11.119 --> 11:13.988
Richard:
For years the oil business was,

11:14.056 --> 11:15.656
it was all about getting
rich for me.

11:15.723 --> 11:17.957
And I was. Am.

11:18.024 --> 11:19.558
Rich, that is.

11:19.625 --> 11:22.094
Well, your name's been
on the Forbes 100 list since...

11:22.162 --> 11:23.595
Since I was a teenager.

11:23.662 --> 11:26.064
Well, as corny as it sounds,
all the money in the world

11:26.130 --> 11:28.164
is not gonna fill that
hole in your soul.

11:28.231 --> 11:30.099
<i>And that's why I started</i>
<i>investing in R&D</i>

11:30.167 --> 11:32.034
<i>for eco-friendly technologies.</i>

11:32.100 --> 11:33.967
I mean, I believe that's
everybody's responsibility.

11:34.035 --> 11:35.069
That's the way
of the future.

11:35.136 --> 11:36.737
Absolutely.

11:36.805 --> 11:39.339
Well, you either move forward
or you get left behind.

11:39.406 --> 11:40.807
I agree completely,
Mr. Chenowith.

11:40.873 --> 11:42.640
Please, call me Richard.

11:42.708 --> 11:44.641
Okay.

11:44.709 --> 11:45.842
That's why I'm always
on the look out

11:45.911 --> 11:47.878
for alternate sources
of energy.

11:47.944 --> 11:49.812
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Yeah, I'm actually in talks</i>
<i>with some investors from Dubai</i>

11:49.879 --> 11:50.946
about a little pet project
of mine

11:51.014 --> 11:52.214
I'm trying to get going.

11:52.280 --> 11:55.216
It's algae farms to generate
bio-diesel fuel.

11:55.283 --> 11:57.685
Have you got
material on it?

11:57.752 --> 11:59.985
I'd be happy to sign
a non-disclosure.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.836
Well, yeah, absolutely.

12:01.903 --> 12:03.404
I could get something
to you by tomorrow.

12:03.472 --> 12:04.405
Excellent.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.639
Great.

12:05.706 --> 12:07.474
Well, here's to
a fantastic meal,

12:07.540 --> 12:08.474
<i>and a wonderful hostess.</i>

12:08.541 --> 12:09.375
Hear, hear.

12:09.443 --> 12:11.310
And to future plans.

12:11.378 --> 12:12.811
(Glasses clicking)

12:15.981 --> 12:18.115
Can I interest anyone
in some dessert?

12:18.182 --> 12:19.815
I'd love some.

12:19.882 --> 12:22.451
Peter: Sure. I'll rustle up some
more wood for this fire here.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.920
(Chopping sounds)

12:33.724 --> 12:36.926
(Gasping) Richard.
You startled me.

12:36.995 --> 12:38.828
Just admiring
the view.

12:38.896 --> 12:40.364
Lou:
It is beautiful here, isn't it?

12:40.430 --> 12:41.930
Richard:
Stunning.

12:45.434 --> 12:47.634
So we going on that
trail ride tomorrow?

12:47.702 --> 12:50.004
We are.
Rain or shine.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.271
I look forward to it.

12:57.541 --> 12:58.875
(Horse snorting)

13:02.345 --> 13:03.478
Come on.

13:05.513 --> 13:07.114
(Stall door opening)

13:12.185 --> 13:14.153
(Door creaking shut)

13:14.221 --> 13:16.022
Ah, look at him.

13:17.623 --> 13:19.156
He's amazing.

13:19.890 --> 13:21.324
Look at you.

13:21.391 --> 13:23.591
Fatherhood suits you.

13:26.761 --> 13:28.729
(Horse whinnies loudly)

13:29.231 --> 13:29.963
Amy:
Ty...

13:30.032 --> 13:30.998
(Horse whines)

13:31.064 --> 13:32.797
He's fine. He's fine.

13:33.366 --> 13:35.666
(Kiss)
Come on. Come on.

13:35.734 --> 13:37.668
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

13:40.937 --> 13:42.871
(Horse whinnies loudly)

13:43.672 --> 13:46.341
(Chuckling)
(Stall door opening)

13:50.412 --> 13:52.345
(Alarm bleeping loudly)

13:56.482 --> 13:57.449
(Dull thump)

13:58.482 --> 13:59.215
(Sighing)

14:03.220 --> 14:04.720
(Sighing heavily)

14:04.787 --> 14:06.355
(Chickens clucking)

14:14.427 --> 14:15.726
(Dramatic music)

14:22.041 --> 14:23.708
<i>Probably was that cougar.</i>

14:26.145 --> 14:28.813
Mallory:
Poor Charlotte.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.814
(Metal rattling)
I think...

14:30.882 --> 14:33.550
I found her escape route
right here.

14:33.617 --> 14:34.817
Mallory:
This is all my fault.

14:34.884 --> 14:36.418
I should have seen where
she was getting out.

14:36.486 --> 14:38.387
I'll tell you what.

14:38.453 --> 14:41.053
You give me a hand
and we'll fill in the hole

14:41.121 --> 14:44.090
and make sure it can't
ever happen again.

14:44.157 --> 14:45.157
Mallory:
Thank you, Jack.

14:46.892 --> 14:49.193
Ty: I think we should keep
Merlin in the barn today.

14:49.261 --> 14:51.061
Ty, he'll be fine out
in the round pen

14:51.128 --> 14:53.330
as long as we're here.

14:54.464 --> 14:55.464
Mallory:
No offense, Ty,

14:55.532 --> 14:56.631
but you look like
death warmed over.

14:56.698 --> 14:58.064
(Sighing)

14:58.133 --> 14:59.501
Funny, that's what
you looked like

14:59.567 --> 15:00.567
when you went through
your Goth period,

15:00.635 --> 15:03.103
only you did that
on purpose.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.270
Do you have
to be so harsh?

15:04.337 --> 15:06.772
I just lost
a loved one.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.741
Mallory, I'm sorry.
I just...

15:10.809 --> 15:12.075
I'm tired.

15:12.143 --> 15:14.377
Amy and I have been
up all night with Merlin.

15:14.444 --> 15:16.846
Apparently I was a lot like
Merlin when I was a baby.

15:16.913 --> 15:18.914
Sleeping most of the day,
up most of the night,

15:18.981 --> 15:21.215
and I was always hungry.

15:21.282 --> 15:23.416
So what's changed?

15:24.351 --> 15:27.220
Lou: Well, I need you both to
know there's been a cougar

15:27.287 --> 15:28.954
spotted in the area.

15:29.421 --> 15:32.489
We think it killed one
of our chickens this morning.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.026
So, if you're not comfortable
going riding today,

15:35.092 --> 15:36.025
I totally understand.

15:36.092 --> 15:37.293
Richard:
Oh, come on, Lou.

15:37.359 --> 15:38.726
I tangled with
a mountain lion in Texas,

15:38.794 --> 15:41.395
and let's just say the lion
come out the loser.

15:41.463 --> 15:42.563
Yeah, I'm okay if he's okay.

15:42.630 --> 15:43.931
All right, then...

15:44.731 --> 15:45.998
Let's head out.

15:49.668 --> 15:51.869
Peter: Well, you certainly
know your way around a horse.

15:51.937 --> 15:54.238
Richard:
Well, I grew up on a ranch.

15:54.305 --> 15:59.408
I got swept up in this oil biz
thing barely out of my teens.

15:59.474 --> 16:01.309
But I'm living
on a ranch again,

16:01.376 --> 16:02.409
playing the cowboy.

16:02.477 --> 16:03.811
Peter:
(Chuckles)

16:03.878 --> 16:05.278
And running one of the most
successful businesses

16:05.378 --> 16:06.511
in North America.

16:06.579 --> 16:08.847
Richard:
I'll tell you my secret, Peter.

16:08.914 --> 16:10.915
I'm real good
at supervising people

16:10.982 --> 16:13.817
who are younger
and smarter than me.

16:13.885 --> 16:14.651
That's where
you come in.

16:14.719 --> 16:15.986
(Chuckling)

16:16.053 --> 16:17.954
How about we stop here
for lunch?

16:18.020 --> 16:18.553
Sure.

16:18.620 --> 16:20.055
Sounds good.

16:22.925 --> 16:26.327
Peter: I'll take your
horse there, Richard.

16:32.796 --> 16:34.931
Oh!
(Laughing)

16:34.999 --> 16:36.766
Uh, I trust
you slept well?

16:36.834 --> 16:39.035
Well, actually, no.
I tossed and turned all night.

16:39.102 --> 16:41.169
It's all your fault.

16:41.237 --> 16:43.137
It's the mattress,
wasn't it?

16:43.454 --> 16:44.454
No.

16:45.490 --> 16:48.225
Naw, it's not the mattress.

16:49.825 --> 16:52.827
I'm sorry. I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

16:53.762 --> 16:54.729
Oh.

16:58.331 --> 17:00.532
Sure is beautiful out here.

17:04.435 --> 17:05.902
It's going pretty good,
don't you think?

17:05.969 --> 17:07.069
Lou:
Yeah...

17:07.137 --> 17:09.438
But I think Richard is...

17:09.507 --> 17:10.673
Listen, Lou,

17:10.740 --> 17:12.040
you don't need to sell
him to me, okay?

17:12.108 --> 17:13.374
He's a good guy.

17:13.441 --> 17:15.242
I think we can do some
great things together.

17:15.309 --> 17:17.710
And it's all because of you
and you're amazing.

17:17.777 --> 17:18.710
(Kiss)

17:23.516 --> 17:24.815
There.

17:24.882 --> 17:27.884
Your birds won't be getting
out after bedtime any more.

17:27.952 --> 17:29.452
Thanks, Jack.

17:29.519 --> 17:30.985
<i>Ty:</i> <i>I'm not going to
bully</i> <i>him into it.</i>

17:31.052 --> 17:33.086
Amy: Do you ever see me bully a horse?

17:33.155 --> 17:34.488
<i>I know what I'm doing, Ty.</i>

17:34.555 --> 17:36.356

like Marion and Tim

17:36.423 --> 17:38.224
<i>when Lou was first born.</i>

17:38.292 --> 17:39.492
And look what
happened to them.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.860
The big D.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.162
Divorce.

<i>Amy:</i>
<i>I'm just being practical, okay!</i>

17:45.962 --> 17:47.530
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>You're being unreasonable.</i>

17:47.598 --> 17:48.598
He's a baby.

17:48.665 --> 17:49.431
You don't need to show
him who's boss.

17:49.498 --> 17:50.532
Amy:
Yes, you do!

17:50.599 --> 17:51.199
Or he's gonna
be a spoiled brat!

17:51.267 --> 17:52.433
A spoiled brat?

17:52.501 --> 17:53.901
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Um, according to Dr. Kirk,</i>

17:53.968 --> 17:56.002
children like having
boundaries.

17:56.070 --> 17:57.204
Amy and Ty:
Just shut up, Mallory!

17:57.272 --> 17:58.338
Amy:
God!

17:58.405 --> 17:59.505
All right, Ty,
just hold him still!

17:59.573 --> 18:00.505
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>I'm holding him still!</i>

18:00.573 --> 18:01.473
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>You're not!</i>

18:01.541 --> 18:02.774
Richard:
I like you, Peter.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.776
Better than them windbags
at Pembridge Oil.

18:05.843 --> 18:08.379
Peter: Well, I'm glad to hear
it, because I'll tell ya,

18:08.445 --> 18:09.979
I not gonna be able to match
what they're offering you

18:10.046 --> 18:11.813
for your Canadian
distribution rights.

18:11.881 --> 18:13.282
(Cougar growling lowly)

18:13.348 --> 18:15.516
Richard: I'm pretty good
at trusting my instincts.

18:15.584 --> 18:17.284
<i>Peter:</i> <i>(Chuckling)</i> <i>Yeah.</i>

18:17.351 --> 18:19.052
(Cougar growls fiercely)
(Horse whinnies wildly)

18:19.118 --> 18:20.186
Lou:
Oh, careful!

18:20.253 --> 18:21.420
(Cougar growls fiercely)
(Horse whinnies)

18:21.487 --> 18:22.987
(Cougar growls fiercely)
(Horse whinnies)

18:23.055 --> 18:24.055
Richard:
(Grunts)

18:24.122 --> 18:25.490
(Cougar growls menacingly)

18:25.558 --> 18:26.291
Go on! Get!

18:26.358 --> 18:27.692
(Cougar growls fiercely)

18:27.758 --> 18:29.459
Peter:
Go on! Ha! Ha!

18:29.526 --> 18:30.993
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Go on!</i>

18:31.061 --> 18:31.960
(Gasping)

18:32.028 --> 18:33.995
(Cougar growls fiercely)

18:36.964 --> 18:38.765
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

18:40.568 --> 18:42.702
Mr. Chenowith, are you okay?

18:42.768 --> 18:43.735
Yeah.

18:46.238 --> 18:48.338
Just a few bruises is all.

18:52.308 --> 18:55.142
Lou: I gotta call Grandpa
and let him know.

18:55.211 --> 18:57.978
Shoot! I didn't bring my phone.
Did you?

18:58.045 --> 18:59.145
Peter:
Yeah, I'll go check in the car.

18:59.213 --> 19:00.279
Lou:
Okay.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.814
(Coughing and grimacing)

19:02.882 --> 19:04.183
Ooh.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.617
Okay, that hurts.

19:05.684 --> 19:08.219
You probably cracked a rib.

19:08.285 --> 19:10.186
We're gonna have to get
you to a doctor.

19:10.254 --> 19:12.021
(Wincing)
Geez.

19:12.089 --> 19:13.489
I'm gonna get you some
ice for this, okay?

19:13.556 --> 19:16.258
Oh, that's not necessary.
I got a better idea.

19:16.325 --> 19:16.957
Uh...

19:18.093 --> 19:19.960
Why don't you just
kiss it better?

19:20.028 --> 19:22.195
Okay, that's not very funny,
Mr. Chenowith.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.495
Well, who's trying
to be funny?

19:23.563 --> 19:26.332
I am dead serious, Lou.
I find you very attractive.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.465
You know what?

19:27.532 --> 19:28.832
The feeling is not
reciprocated.

19:28.899 --> 19:30.616
Well, there you go with those
little white lies again.

19:30.634 --> 19:32.502
Now, come on, Lou,
I know your type.

19:32.570 --> 19:35.972
Peter:
Hey! What's going on?!

19:36.039 --> 19:37.572
Oh, come on, Peter.

19:37.639 --> 19:39.072
You gotta know the moment
your back was turned

19:39.139 --> 19:40.707
she was all over me.

19:40.774 --> 19:42.609
(Disgusted gasp)

19:43.076 --> 19:44.210
Richard:
(Grunting)

19:44.277 --> 19:45.110
(Violent punch)

19:45.177 --> 19:46.445
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Peter!</i>

19:46.512 --> 19:47.779
(Grunt and punch)

19:47.846 --> 19:48.979
Stop!

19:49.047 --> 19:50.881
Peter, calm down!

19:51.950 --> 19:53.150
(Violent punch)

19:58.353 --> 19:59.754
Caleb:
Hey, guys!

19:59.821 --> 20:01.188
Ty: You can't expect him to
drink out of that, Amy.

20:01.256 --> 20:02.656
Well, he's gotta learn
sometime.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.307
It'll be way easier
to feed him

20:04.324 --> 20:05.391
and less labor
intensive.

20:05.458 --> 20:06.458
Caleb: Well, aren't you just
the cutest little thing.

20:06.525 --> 20:07.425
(Horse nips violently)
Ow!

20:07.743 --> 20:09.176
Ty:
Whoa, whoa, Caleb!

20:09.244 --> 20:10.478
You can't put out
your hand out like that.

20:10.544 --> 20:11.911
You're a stranger to him.

20:11.979 --> 20:13.179
He's just acting
off instinct.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.214
Which is exactly why
we have to train him.

20:15.281 --> 20:18.350
He has to get used
to people, dogs, kids.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.986
Come on, little guy,
you can drink.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.453
Just drink this.
(Horse whinnies wildly)

20:22.520 --> 20:24.154
(Water splashes)

20:24.222 --> 20:25.954
You little brat!

20:26.022 --> 20:27.489
Ty:
Don't call him names, Amy!

20:27.556 --> 20:28.789
Don't tell me what to do!

20:28.857 --> 20:30.191
Uh...

20:30.258 --> 20:32.659
I'm just gonna go get some
stuff I left in the barn.

20:32.726 --> 20:33.659
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Good idea.</i>

20:33.727 --> 20:34.360
Ty:
That's okay. Good boy.

20:34.428 --> 20:35.661
Oh, yeah, great.

20:35.729 --> 20:36.862
Now you're rewarding him
for bad behavior?

20:36.930 --> 20:37.830
Well, you can't expect
him to suddenly drink

20:37.897 --> 20:38.563
out of a pail!

20:38.631 --> 20:39.431
He's got to learn.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.032
He will!

20:41.099 --> 20:42.066
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Okay, all right, fine.</i>

20:42.133 --> 20:43.199
<i>You are way too lenient.</i>

20:43.266 --> 20:44.266
Ty:
And you're a dictator!

20:44.334 --> 20:46.402
Lou:
Oh, great, thanks, mature.

20:47.669 --> 20:49.303
(Water splashes)

20:49.371 --> 20:50.371
(Sighing)

20:51.473 --> 20:52.640
(Car starts up)

20:53.341 --> 20:54.274
(Roars away)

21:03.680 --> 21:05.114
I am so sorry.

21:06.183 --> 21:07.450
What?

21:07.518 --> 21:08.851
What do you have
to be sorry about?

21:08.918 --> 21:10.718
I set this whole thing up
and I didn't think it through.

21:10.786 --> 21:11.686
No, no...

21:11.753 --> 21:12.886
No, I should have...

21:12.954 --> 21:14.120
I should have found out
more about this guy,

21:14.188 --> 21:17.490
set up a formal meeting.

21:17.556 --> 21:18.722
Damn.

21:18.791 --> 21:20.825
And you guys were
getting along so well.

21:20.892 --> 21:22.293
Lou, look at me.

21:24.028 --> 21:25.895
That guy is a total ass.

21:25.963 --> 21:27.197
I know.

21:27.264 --> 21:30.798
Okay? And it is not
your fault, all right?

21:30.865 --> 21:33.967
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

21:36.836 --> 21:38.037
(Sighing)

21:42.507 --> 21:44.641
(Horse slurping hungrily)

21:44.709 --> 21:46.176
(Horses panicking)

21:48.378 --> 21:50.712
(Horses whinnying skittishly)

21:55.083 --> 21:56.516
(Horses whinnying)

22:00.886 --> 22:02.086
Hey, boy.

22:02.153 --> 22:03.287
(Horse snorting nervously)

22:03.355 --> 22:05.223
Hey.

22:05.289 --> 22:06.989
(Cougar growling lowly)
(Horse whinnying shrilly)

22:07.091 --> 22:08.857
(Cougar growling)

22:08.924 --> 22:10.158
Ty!

22:11.427 --> 22:12.694
Ty!

22:13.562 --> 22:14.962
<i>Ty, there's a cougar!</i>

22:15.029 --> 22:16.730
(Running footsteps)

22:16.797 --> 22:17.896
(Door banging)

22:20.199 --> 22:21.932
(Cougar growls and hisses)

22:22.000 --> 22:23.667
Amy, get in the stall.

22:23.734 --> 22:24.834
Get in the stall,
shut the door!

22:24.902 --> 22:26.470
Close the door!

22:26.537 --> 22:28.505
(Cougar growls and hisses)

22:28.573 --> 22:29.506
(Door shuts)

22:31.374 --> 22:33.641
Ty: Huh!
(Cougar growls fiercely)

22:33.708 --> 22:34.608
Ha!

22:34.675 --> 22:36.009
Ha!

22:36.076 --> 22:37.477
(Yelling menacingly)

22:38.579 --> 22:40.246
(Cougar growls lowly)

22:47.223 --> 22:48.691
<i>The horses are good.</i>

22:48.757 --> 22:50.224
They're scared, but good.

22:50.292 --> 22:51.659
Lou:
Thank God.

22:51.727 --> 22:53.260
You sure you guys are okay?

22:53.327 --> 22:55.696
Ty:
Fine. Everything's fine.

22:55.762 --> 22:57.930
Jack: Okay, well, I'll walk you
girls back to the house then.

22:57.998 --> 22:59.031
Amy:
Uh, Grandpa...

22:59.098 --> 23:00.530
I'll be right in.

23:01.032 --> 23:02.833
Lou:
Come on, Grandpa.

23:05.569 --> 23:06.402
Amy:
Hey.

23:07.738 --> 23:09.338
Ty: You should get
some sleep, okay?

23:09.405 --> 23:11.106
I'll finish the feedings
tonight.

23:11.173 --> 23:13.174
Amy: It's okay.
I'll come back at 5:00.

23:13.241 --> 23:14.174
It's easier if I do it.
I'm already in the barn.

23:14.242 --> 23:16.409
I'll make sure
the doors are shut.

23:16.476 --> 23:17.375
Okay?

23:18.011 --> 23:19.778
You think I screwed up.

23:19.845 --> 23:20.712
I didn't say that.

23:20.779 --> 23:21.813
No, but you were
thinking it.

23:21.880 --> 23:23.347
You- you're right.

23:23.415 --> 23:24.816
You know,
I left the barn doors open.

23:24.882 --> 23:26.249
It's my fault.

23:26.316 --> 23:27.149
I'm sorry.
I'm an idiot.

23:27.217 --> 23:28.484
No, Amy, stop!

23:28.551 --> 23:31.153
Don't just walk away,
okay?

23:32.654 --> 23:34.722
Look, I know you
didn't mean to.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.289
You're exhausted.
I'm exhausted.

23:37.357 --> 23:40.326
Just get some sleep,
all right?

23:40.392 --> 23:42.260
I'll finish the stuff up
for tonight.

23:42.327 --> 23:43.160
Okay.

23:47.999 --> 23:49.098
I'll see you
in the morning.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.566
Yeah.

23:50.633 --> 23:52.967
(Door rumbles and slams shut)

23:55.437 --> 23:56.703
(Rooster crows)

23:59.240 --> 24:01.241
(Knock at the door)

24:01.308 --> 24:02.074
(Sighing)

24:06.944 --> 24:08.077
Hi.

24:08.146 --> 24:09.146
Young man:
Samantha Louise Fleming?

24:09.213 --> 24:10.380
Yes.

24:11.448 --> 24:13.882
You've just been served.

24:13.949 --> 24:15.082
What?!

24:20.887 --> 24:22.087
(Dialing phone)

24:24.257 --> 24:27.825
Peter, you're not going
to believe this.

24:27.892 --> 24:31.328
Richard Chenowith is claiming
he got serious injuries

24:31.395 --> 24:33.062
from the cougar attack.

24:33.129 --> 24:34.263
Yeah, and he's saying

24:34.330 --> 24:35.497
we knew there was a cougar
in the area

24:35.565 --> 24:37.532
and we didn't warn him

24:37.598 --> 24:40.300
and he is suing
me for negligence.

24:49.907 --> 24:51.141
<i>You sure are cute,</i>

24:51.208 --> 24:54.509
but you're a trouble maker,
you know that?

24:54.576 --> 24:55.809
Hey, boy.

24:56.478 --> 24:57.411
How are you, Merlin?

24:57.479 --> 24:58.612
(Horse snorts)

24:59.648 --> 25:01.915
Stalls still need
to be mucked out.

25:01.982 --> 25:03.583
Mallory:
I'll do it.

25:04.917 --> 25:05.917
What are you doing?

25:05.984 --> 25:07.485
Jack told me what
happened last night.

25:07.554 --> 25:09.853
So, I'm giving you guys
a much-needed break.

25:09.920 --> 25:13.122
You can go riding,
take a nap, whatever.

25:13.190 --> 25:14.390
Well,
what about Merlin?

25:14.457 --> 25:16.192
Well, I got an "A"
in the babysitting course,

25:16.258 --> 25:18.926
so he'll be perfectly
safe with me.

25:18.994 --> 25:20.094
I don't think so.

25:20.161 --> 25:21.361
You do what you want, okay,

25:21.429 --> 25:23.430
but I'm gonna take Spartan
out for a ride.

25:23.498 --> 25:24.597
Thank you.

25:27.932 --> 25:28.899
(Sighing)

25:28.965 --> 25:30.933
Dr. Kirk says, new parents,

25:31.001 --> 25:32.502
they need time
for themselves

25:32.569 --> 25:34.969
so their relationships
don't suffer.

25:35.038 --> 25:36.406
And in case
you haven't noticed,

25:36.472 --> 25:39.374
your relationship
is suffering.

25:41.108 --> 25:43.510
Ty: Here a list of Scott's numbers.
Okay?

25:43.577 --> 25:44.543
And don't forget
to feed him.

25:44.611 --> 25:45.511
And don't feed
him too much

25:45.579 --> 25:46.745
or he'll get diarrhea, okay?

25:46.812 --> 25:48.112
And if you don't give
him enough

25:48.180 --> 25:49.480
he's gonna go hungry.
So keep an eye on him.

25:49.547 --> 25:50.914
Enough. Go!

25:51.881 --> 25:52.781
Ty:
Okay.

25:52.849 --> 25:53.482
Amy:
Coming for a ride?

25:53.551 --> 25:54.851
Ty:
Yeah.

25:54.918 --> 25:56.585
Amy: Yeah, well, you
might need a horse.

25:56.652 --> 25:57.485
Ty:
Right.

25:59.187 --> 26:00.854
Certifiable, totally.

26:01.922 --> 26:02.822
(Chuckling)

26:03.624 --> 26:05.891
(Birds chirping)

26:06.458 --> 26:07.759
Ty: I think I'm gonna
call Mallory here.

26:07.826 --> 26:08.859
Amy:
Ty. Ty, stop!

26:10.061 --> 26:11.762
Stop worrying about Merlin.

26:11.830 --> 26:14.296
Ty: Okay, okay. I'm not worried.

26:14.363 --> 26:15.097
I'm not.

26:15.164 --> 26:16.598
Amy:
Okay.

26:16.664 --> 26:19.499
You know, my mom,
she told me once

26:19.567 --> 26:21.135
that whenever she got out
with my dad,

26:21.202 --> 26:23.002
even just for like a night,

26:23.070 --> 26:26.572
she was so excited, right?
Some time away.

26:26.639 --> 26:28.240
But then when she was out
on their date

26:28.306 --> 26:29.806
all she could think about was-

26:29.874 --> 26:30.673
Ty:
Was you and Lou.

26:30.741 --> 26:32.208
Amy:
Yeah, exactly.

26:33.543 --> 26:34.777
And then a couple hours
would go by

26:34.845 --> 26:38.748
and she couldn't wait
to get home to see us.

26:38.813 --> 26:41.882
Ty: I guess my story's
a bit different.

26:43.718 --> 26:44.618
Um...

26:46.452 --> 26:48.419
When I was little,

26:50.488 --> 26:52.056
I promised myself that
if I ever had a kid

26:52.123 --> 26:54.590
I would be everything
my parents weren't.

26:54.657 --> 26:57.893
All any kid of mine would
ever get from me is love.

26:57.961 --> 26:59.161
I get it.

27:00.628 --> 27:01.426
You get what?

27:01.495 --> 27:04.030
Well, you and your...
baby.

27:04.098 --> 27:05.431
(Chuckling)

27:05.498 --> 27:06.098
My baby? What-?

27:06.165 --> 27:07.298
Because?? Merlin.

27:07.366 --> 27:08.599
That's why you treat
him the way you do.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.101
Oh, come on.

27:10.169 --> 27:11.435
No, I'm serious.

27:11.502 --> 27:14.872
You want to give him nothing
but love and...

27:14.938 --> 27:16.872
You know, Ty,
you can love something,

27:16.939 --> 27:18.706
someone,

27:18.774 --> 27:20.674
and still give
them boundaries.

27:20.742 --> 27:22.176
My mom,
she loved me like crazy,

27:22.243 --> 27:24.944
but if ever
I threw a tantrum

27:25.012 --> 27:26.179
or something like that,

27:26.246 --> 27:28.881
I got five minutes
in the no-no chair.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.116
Sorry, the what?
The no-no chair?

27:33.184 --> 27:34.951
(Embarrassed sputtering)

27:35.018 --> 27:36.418
Both:
(Laughing)

27:36.486 --> 27:38.453
How cute would you look
sitting in the no-no chair?

27:38.521 --> 27:39.621
(Laughing)

27:39.688 --> 27:40.855
So sad.

27:40.923 --> 27:42.056
<i>Ty:</i> <i>(Laughing)</i> <i>So sad.</i>

27:42.123 --> 27:43.223
Both:
(Laughing)

27:44.125 --> 27:45.993
(Cougar growling lowly)

27:47.627 --> 27:49.227
We should head back.

27:49.294 --> 27:49.994
Amy:
Okay.

27:52.763 --> 27:53.997
Hey, Ty...

27:54.064 --> 27:56.032
I think that's cougar scat.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.200
(Cougar growling lowly)

27:57.267 --> 27:58.533
Ty:
Amy!

27:58.601 --> 28:00.368
(Cougar growling fiercely)
(Horses whinnying)

28:00.436 --> 28:01.736
(Gunshot booms)

28:15.261 --> 28:16.461
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>I can't watch this.</i>

28:16.529 --> 28:18.462
Ty: It'll be fine, Amy.
It's okay.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.131
I just tranked him.

28:20.197 --> 28:21.597
She'll be right as rain
in a couple of hours.

28:21.665 --> 28:22.965
Amy:
Where are you taking her?

28:23.033 --> 28:24.733
A wildlife preserve
just north of here.

28:24.799 --> 28:26.267
They'll keep her caged
till she wakes up,

28:26.334 --> 28:27.300
then let her loose.

28:27.368 --> 28:28.801
Jack: And you guys
should go home.

28:28.869 --> 28:31.104
Mallory was coping... sort of.

28:32.539 --> 28:33.439
Coping?

28:34.841 --> 28:35.541
What do you
mean sort of?

28:35.608 --> 28:38.044
Okay, okay,
we'll go.

28:38.110 --> 28:41.211
Warren,
thank you for your help.

28:41.278 --> 28:43.079
It's what the job called for,
Jack.

28:43.146 --> 28:44.413
Nothing more, nothing less.

28:44.480 --> 28:45.813
It's what we do.

28:46.781 --> 28:48.549
(Truck door slams shut)

28:48.616 --> 28:50.317
(Truck rumbling away)

28:52.486 --> 28:53.853
(Squawking sound)

28:58.989 --> 29:00.357
(Squawking sound)

29:08.330 --> 29:10.464
Jesus Murphy.

29:10.831 --> 29:12.565
(Cooing sounds)

29:12.632 --> 29:13.866
- It's all lies!
-Of course it is.

29:13.933 --> 29:14.732
And you know what
the worst of it is?

29:14.800 --> 29:16.935
Is that even if he loses,

29:17.002 --> 29:18.203
imagine the legal fees
we're gonna have to pay

29:18.270 --> 29:20.438
just to defend ourselves!

29:20.505 --> 29:21.505
Richard could
ruin us!

29:21.573 --> 29:23.574
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

29:23.640 --> 29:24.707
Yeah.

29:24.775 --> 29:25.841
Lou, I'm not.

29:25.909 --> 29:27.709
- Okay.
- Listen to me.

29:27.776 --> 29:28.609
Yes.

29:28.677 --> 29:31.179
We will figure
something out.

29:31.245 --> 29:32.011
(Breathes deeply)
Yes.

29:32.080 --> 29:32.879
Okay?

29:32.947 --> 29:33.913
Okay.

29:35.914 --> 29:37.048
(Door opening)

29:40.186 --> 29:41.619
Hi, sweetheart.

29:42.687 --> 29:43.919
So, I've got Rosalita

29:43.986 --> 29:45.387
making your favourite
for dinner tonight -

29:45.456 --> 29:46.922
homemade mac and cheese.

29:46.989 --> 29:48.856
And you'll never guess what
I found in the upstairs bar.

29:48.958 --> 29:50.024
The old fondue set!

29:50.092 --> 29:52.393
So I thought we'll have
a really decadent

29:52.461 --> 29:53.494
chocolate fondue
for dessert.

29:53.561 --> 29:54.860
What do you think
of that?

29:54.928 --> 29:56.229
Mac and cheese
and chocolate fondue.

29:56.296 --> 29:57.062
Sounds amazing.

29:57.130 --> 29:58.130
(Laughing)

29:58.198 --> 30:00.298
Um, but I can't.

30:00.365 --> 30:01.566
Oh... why?

30:01.632 --> 30:02.899
Why? Do you have plans?

30:02.967 --> 30:03.900
Yeah.

30:05.335 --> 30:06.569
Oh, well...

30:08.103 --> 30:09.136
No.

30:10.088 --> 30:11.389
Look, Mom,

30:12.825 --> 30:13.725
you have to understand.

30:13.790 --> 30:15.290
Just because I'm back
home again,

30:15.359 --> 30:17.893
doesn't mean that I can hang
out with you every night.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.562
I mean, have a life too,
you know?

30:20.628 --> 30:23.096
Or at least I used to.

30:23.164 --> 30:25.031
Of course.

30:25.098 --> 30:27.333
Of course you do.
(Chuckling)

30:27.400 --> 30:28.933
(Sighing)

30:29.001 --> 30:30.402
And obviously I don't
or I wouldn't be digging out

30:30.470 --> 30:32.636
old fondue sets, right?

30:32.703 --> 30:34.838
I'm really sorry, Ashley.

30:34.905 --> 30:36.339
I'll back off. I...

30:36.406 --> 30:38.039
No, I didn't say back off...

30:38.107 --> 30:40.576
No, honey, I get it.

30:40.642 --> 30:42.276
And I promise.

30:42.343 --> 30:44.745
You want some space.

30:44.812 --> 30:46.179
Yeah.

30:46.247 --> 30:47.646
You got it.

30:53.584 --> 30:54.650
(Annoyed sigh)

30:57.588 --> 30:58.421
You okay?

30:58.489 --> 31:00.155
Yeah, thank you.

31:01.123 --> 31:03.524
Ty, go check on Merlin.
I know you're dying to.

31:03.591 --> 31:04.957
(Door opening)

31:05.024 --> 31:06.692
(Relieved sigh)

31:06.760 --> 31:09.961
Mallory: Merlin is such a brat.
He bit me! He kicked me!

31:10.029 --> 31:11.363
You guys need to call
in super nanny!

31:11.430 --> 31:12.830
Ty:
Mallory...

31:12.897 --> 31:14.197
What's wrong?

31:14.265 --> 31:16.833
The cougar,
he almost attacked Amy.

31:16.901 --> 31:19.035
A Hudson Wildlife Control guy
tranked it before it got to us.

31:19.102 --> 31:20.702
Oh my God, Amy,
are you okay?

31:20.770 --> 31:22.203
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just...

31:22.270 --> 31:23.970
I'm worried about the cougar.

31:24.038 --> 31:26.740
He'll be fine. They're taking
him to a reserve, okay?

31:26.807 --> 31:28.474
Jack:
Well, I know one little fella

31:28.542 --> 31:31.577
<i>who'll be mighty glad</i>
<i>to hear that.</i>

31:31.644 --> 31:33.278
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Oh my gosh!</i>

31:33.344 --> 31:34.912
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>No way.</i>

31:34.978 --> 31:36.645
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>The cougar was a mom?</i>

31:36.713 --> 31:39.748
Oh, Grampa,
no wonder she attacked us!

31:40.516 --> 31:42.082
Yes, hello! Hello!

31:42.150 --> 31:42.917
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Oh my gosh.</i>

31:42.983 --> 31:44.885
First Merlin, now this.

31:44.952 --> 31:46.753
It's like you
guys got twins.

31:46.821 --> 31:48.422
Amy: (Laughing)
(Cub growls cutely)

31:48.488 --> 31:50.322
Hi. How are you?

31:51.490 --> 31:53.090
Ashley:
You saw Amy yesterday?

31:53.157 --> 31:54.925
Soraya: How nice for you.
I haven't seen her in a week.

31:54.992 --> 31:56.293
Typical story.

31:56.359 --> 31:59.261
Girl gets boy,
girl dumps friends.

31:59.329 --> 32:00.763
Well, from what I saw,
I wouldn't be surprised

32:00.830 --> 32:03.131
if girl dumps boy.

32:03.197 --> 32:04.632
Soraya:
What are you talking about?

32:04.699 --> 32:06.767
They were fighting like
cats and dogs yesterday.

32:06.834 --> 32:07.900
I guess they're both
pretty burned out

32:07.967 --> 32:10.235
looking after this
orphaned foal.

32:10.302 --> 32:14.972
So maybe you two should
cut her some slack, huh?

32:15.039 --> 32:17.173
Jack:
I called Scott.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.007
Says he can get the kitten
up to its mama,

32:19.075 --> 32:21.109
but not for a day or two.

32:21.177 --> 32:23.878
So for now,
he's our responsibility.

32:23.945 --> 32:25.011
(Cub whimpers)

32:26.279 --> 32:27.814
<i>Oh.</i>

32:27.881 --> 32:29.715
Come here little fella.

32:31.784 --> 32:34.319
(Cub purring)
(Telephone ringing)

32:36.187 --> 32:37.521
(Chuckling)
(Beeping phone on)

32:37.588 --> 32:38.087
Hello?

32:39.223 --> 32:40.389
<i>Uh, yup.</i>

32:40.457 --> 32:42.925
Lou,
it's Richard Chenowith.

32:42.991 --> 32:45.827
(Quietly)
No. Tell him I'm not here.

32:47.862 --> 32:49.362
Actually,
she's not here.

32:49.430 --> 32:51.164
<i>Thanks. Bye-bye.</i>

32:52.398 --> 32:53.732
(Beeping phone off)
Lou.

32:53.799 --> 32:54.799
Lou, what's wrong?

32:54.867 --> 32:56.767
What was that all about?

32:56.835 --> 32:58.635
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

32:58.702 --> 33:00.770
Hey, you're holding him
too tight there. Careful.

33:00.838 --> 33:03.706
Just give me
the damn bottle.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.841
(Cub whimpering)

33:05.907 --> 33:08.041
Jack:
Now I know I'm not your mama,

33:08.109 --> 33:10.377
but I'll have to do tonight.

33:11.578 --> 33:13.111
Ty:
(Chuckling)

33:13.178 --> 33:16.647
Oh, man, where's the camera
when I need it?

33:20.685 --> 33:22.051
Now, uh,

33:22.118 --> 33:25.153
you and Amy have been under
a lot of strain lately,

33:25.220 --> 33:27.321
together 24/7.

33:27.389 --> 33:29.322
We'll get through it.

33:29.389 --> 33:30.790
You know, uh,

33:30.858 --> 33:34.460
you know, when Lyndy was
touring with her band,

33:34.527 --> 33:37.128
oh, I missed her like crazy.

33:37.195 --> 33:40.764
But whenever she walked
through that door,

33:41.832 --> 33:44.399
I loved her even more.

33:44.467 --> 33:46.001
What are you trying to say,
Jack?

33:46.067 --> 33:48.736
Scott mentioned that job
over at the racetrack.

33:48.803 --> 33:49.903
It's still yours
if you want it.

33:49.970 --> 33:52.771
That's all I'm trying
to say.

33:54.774 --> 33:55.774
(Cub slurping)

33:55.842 --> 33:57.510
Yeah.

33:57.576 --> 33:59.343
He seemed so harmless,
right?

33:59.411 --> 34:01.144
Just like this charming
good ol' boy.

34:01.211 --> 34:02.311
Why didn't
you tell Peter?

34:02.378 --> 34:04.479
Because everything
was going so well

34:04.547 --> 34:06.948
and I didn't want
to ruin everything.

34:07.015 --> 34:08.215
But in the end I guess
I did anyway.

34:08.283 --> 34:09.951
No, you didn't.

34:10.018 --> 34:11.251
I just...

34:11.318 --> 34:12.552
I wish I'd been more
professional

34:12.620 --> 34:14.487
right from the start,
and not been so friendly...

34:14.554 --> 34:15.585
Are you hearing yourself
right now?

34:15.654 --> 34:17.454
This is not your fault.
That guy's creep.

34:17.523 --> 34:21.458
I know, I know.
I just...

34:21.525 --> 34:22.659
(Groaning) Like I feel
like he's taken away

34:22.726 --> 34:25.027
my confidence or something.

34:25.094 --> 34:27.596
I feel like Austin Powers
when he had his mojo stolen.

34:27.663 --> 34:29.831
Except you have
much better teeth.

34:29.898 --> 34:31.031
(Small laugh)

34:31.098 --> 34:32.097
(Amused sigh)

34:32.164 --> 34:34.297
Okay, say I was friendly
with a client

34:34.366 --> 34:36.333
and he turned around
and assaulted me.

34:36.435 --> 34:37.702
Would you blame me?

34:37.768 --> 34:39.069
No, of course not.

34:39.137 --> 34:43.072
I would never let anyone
get away with that.

34:45.141 --> 34:47.243
You're right.
I know.

34:48.309 --> 34:51.344
I can't let him get
away with this.

34:56.014 --> 34:57.248
(Keys clinking)

34:57.750 --> 34:59.150
Amy:
Aw.

34:59.217 --> 35:01.152
Where's the camera
when you need one?

35:01.219 --> 35:02.954
Enough with the cameras.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.285
Where's she going?

35:04.354 --> 35:05.888
Uh, out with Peter.

35:05.955 --> 35:07.255
Great.

35:07.322 --> 35:10.158
We're overrun with orphans
and she's going out.

35:10.224 --> 35:12.125
Well, Ty and I can help look
after the kitten tonight.

35:12.192 --> 35:13.927
Yeah, we're gonna be up
feeding Merlin anyways so...

35:13.994 --> 35:16.262
No, no, I'll do my part.

35:16.328 --> 35:18.263
Caleb:
Ah, we're gonna help, too.

35:18.330 --> 35:19.230
Guys!

35:20.197 --> 35:21.865
Hey, Soraya!

35:21.933 --> 35:23.299
Soraya:
Hey!

35:23.366 --> 35:25.668
I'm sorry.
I've been so busy.

35:25.735 --> 35:27.803
Hey, Caleb!
(Laughing)

35:27.870 --> 35:29.103
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>Aw.</i>

35:29.171 --> 35:30.705
Girls:
(Laughing)

35:30.773 --> 35:32.239
Ashley:
Hey, cutie!

35:33.708 --> 35:35.875
(Car rumbling to stop)

35:35.942 --> 35:37.642
(Cell phone beeping)

35:38.627 --> 35:39.760
You sure this
is the place?

35:39.829 --> 35:41.963
Yes. I called Pembridge
and they confirmed

35:42.030 --> 35:43.197
this is where
he's staying.

35:43.264 --> 35:44.264
(Nervous sigh)

35:44.332 --> 35:45.799
Yeah?
Who were you this time?

35:45.866 --> 35:47.099
An interested client.

35:47.166 --> 35:48.200
(Small laugh)

35:48.267 --> 35:49.467
(Cell phone beeping)

35:49.535 --> 35:51.102
You're crazy.

35:52.303 --> 35:53.236
Lou...

35:54.805 --> 35:56.005
I think you should
reconsider this.

35:56.072 --> 35:57.806
Yeah, you've said that
three times.

35:57.873 --> 35:59.273
Look...

35:59.342 --> 36:00.542
I will call you.

36:00.608 --> 36:02.276
I will leave my cell phone
open in my bag.

36:02.343 --> 36:03.210
You'll be right out front.

36:03.277 --> 36:06.146
You'll hear everything.

36:06.214 --> 36:08.180
I have to do this.

36:08.247 --> 36:09.848
I can't let this creep win.

36:09.915 --> 36:11.749
Okay.

36:11.816 --> 36:12.950
But if anything
goes sideways...

36:13.017 --> 36:15.018
I mean, I am in there
like a shot.

36:15.085 --> 36:18.420
Hey. I wouldn't want
it any other way.

36:18.487 --> 36:19.454
(Quick kiss)

36:20.722 --> 36:21.688
(Cell phone ringing)

36:21.756 --> 36:23.023
Got it.

36:23.091 --> 36:25.491
Lou:
Okay. (Car door shutting)

36:29.794 --> 36:31.262
(Knocking on door)

36:34.666 --> 36:35.766
(Door opening)

36:37.800 --> 36:39.034
Well, well.

36:40.068 --> 36:42.135
Couldn't stay away,
could you?

36:42.203 --> 36:43.871
Hello, Richard.

36:45.039 --> 36:46.974
Well, come on in.

36:49.576 --> 36:51.177
(Door shutting)

36:51.244 --> 36:53.678
(Pouring liquid) I'm guessing
you've here because of the lawsuit.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.512
Well, I was surprised.

36:55.580 --> 36:56.812
I mean...

36:56.880 --> 36:59.114
You know I told you
about that cougar.

36:59.182 --> 37:02.450
<i>And you know you didn't get</i>
<i>those injuries from the fall.</i>

37:02.517 --> 37:05.119
Well, maybe, but it's your word
against mine, isn't it?

37:05.186 --> 37:08.454
And I've got more money
and better lawyers.

37:08.521 --> 37:11.090
So this is how you
get back at women

37:11.156 --> 37:14.824
who spurn your advances?
You sue them?

37:14.893 --> 37:18.161
Well, you hurt my feelings,
Lou.

37:18.228 --> 37:21.897
I don't like get
my feelings hurt.

37:21.963 --> 37:24.464
But there's still a way we can
make this case go away.

37:24.564 --> 37:25.598
Really?

37:29.235 --> 37:30.235
How?

37:30.937 --> 37:32.371
Well, the very fact
that you're here

37:32.437 --> 37:35.172
means I was right
about you.

37:40.242 --> 37:43.677
You are attracted to me,
aren't you?

37:47.247 --> 37:48.814
Stay with me.

37:51.183 --> 37:53.217
So if I...

37:53.284 --> 37:57.887
If I stay the night with you,
you'll drop this phony lawsuit?

37:57.954 --> 37:59.021
That's right.

38:01.624 --> 38:03.625
You see,
in my neck of the woods,

38:03.691 --> 38:06.627
Miss Fleming,
you are what we call a "tease".

38:06.693 --> 38:08.593
(Small laugh)

38:08.661 --> 38:11.596
Well, in my neck of the woods,
Mr. Chenowith,

38:11.663 --> 38:15.566
you are what we call
a lecherous old fart.

38:17.067 --> 38:20.136
Thank you for being
so to the point.

38:20.203 --> 38:22.471
'Cause this,
as well as some conversations

38:22.538 --> 38:24.204
I've had with some women
you've worked with

38:24.271 --> 38:25.805
<i>ought to do the trick.</i>

38:25.872 --> 38:28.274
Weird really how remarkably
similar our stories are.

38:28.342 --> 38:30.343
You little...

38:30.410 --> 38:32.377
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Get your hands off me!</i>

38:32.445 --> 38:33.812
Richard and Lou:
(Grunting and struggling)

38:33.878 --> 38:34.946
(Violent knee to groin)

38:35.013 --> 38:36.981
Richard:
(Grunting in pain)

38:38.082 --> 38:39.382
Peter:
You okay?

38:39.450 --> 38:41.583
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Yeah, I'm fine.
</i> <i>We're good here.</i>

38:41.651 --> 38:43.618
We're expecting a letter from
your lawyer tomorrow

38:43.684 --> 38:46.619
dropping your bogus lawsuit.

38:46.687 --> 38:47.421
(Gasping)

38:49.505 --> 38:50.638
Goodbye...

38:50.707 --> 38:51.773
Dick.

38:54.342 --> 38:56.243
(Door slamming shut)

38:56.310 --> 38:57.542
Lou: I cannot believe
I just did that.

38:57.610 --> 38:58.643
Peter:
Oh my...

38:58.712 --> 39:00.846
You're "feisty" all right.

39:02.614 --> 39:03.748
(Cub slurping)

39:17.490 --> 39:18.457
(Sighing)

40:02.463 --> 40:04.064
<i>Amy:</i> <i>You guys, you didn't
wake</i> <i>us up last night</i>

40:04.131 --> 40:04.865
for our shift.

40:04.881 --> 40:06.782
And you're complaining
because...?

40:06.850 --> 40:08.116
Are you kidding?

40:08.183 --> 40:09.317
I never knew eight hours
of straight sleep

40:09.384 --> 40:10.985
could feel so damned good.
Thank you.

40:11.053 --> 40:12.153
Yeah, thanks, guys.

40:12.220 --> 40:13.187
Oh, no, it was fun,
you know.

40:13.255 --> 40:14.856
At least we got to see you,
sort of.

40:14.923 --> 40:15.689
Sorta.

40:15.757 --> 40:16.389
(Cell phone ringing)

40:16.458 --> 40:18.926
Ugh, it's my mother.

40:18.992 --> 40:20.291
(Beeping phone on)
Hi, Mom.

40:20.359 --> 40:21.392
No, I'm fine.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.828
I'm at Amy's house.

40:23.895 --> 40:25.930
I slept here all night.

40:25.996 --> 40:27.864
Hey, um, I'm starving.
Maybe we could warm up

40:27.932 --> 40:30.333
some of that
mac and cheese?

40:30.399 --> 40:33.234
Well, have Rosalita
make some more!

40:33.301 --> 40:34.268
Others:
(Chuckling)

40:34.336 --> 40:35.336
I'll see you later.

40:35.403 --> 40:36.536
Okay.

40:36.603 --> 40:39.271
Thank you again, Soraya.
That was awesome.

40:39.339 --> 40:41.574
Jack: Scott's found
a home for Merlin.

40:41.641 --> 40:45.711
Says he'll pick him up tomorrow
when he comes for the kitten.

40:45.777 --> 40:46.710
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

40:46.778 --> 40:49.379
That's a relief,
huh, guys?

40:53.615 --> 40:56.851
Lou: Well, I'm glad he
came to his senses.

40:58.185 --> 40:59.486
Thank you.

41:01.454 --> 41:05.524
Richard Chenowith has
dropped the lawsuit!

41:05.590 --> 41:07.957
Hey! Great news!

41:08.492 --> 41:10.192
I'm so happy.
(Kiss)

41:10.259 --> 41:11.460
Well, he had to,
right?

41:11.528 --> 41:13.762
I mean, you had him on tape
with all those women.

41:13.829 --> 41:16.063
Yeah, except I didn't.

41:17.365 --> 41:18.799
You didn't.

41:19.433 --> 41:21.635
I never talked to anyone,

41:21.702 --> 41:24.035
and apparently I need to invest
in a better recorder,

41:24.102 --> 41:26.704
because there was nothing
but static.

41:26.770 --> 41:29.105
(Amazed gasp)
You're nuts!

41:29.172 --> 41:30.139
Well, what can I say?

41:30.206 --> 41:32.541
I'm a heck
of a feisty woman.

41:32.609 --> 41:34.977
(Laughing)
Yes, yes you are.

41:35.043 --> 41:37.979
I guess that's
why I love you.

41:40.480 --> 41:43.482
Wh- what did you just say?

41:43.549 --> 41:46.083
(Sighing)
I think you heard me.

41:46.150 --> 41:48.585
I want to hear it again.

41:52.221 --> 41:54.689
I love you, Lou Fleming.

42:01.961 --> 42:02.895
(Kiss)

42:04.897 --> 42:06.363
(Horses snuffling)

42:10.367 --> 42:11.434
Oh, I thought I should
get him used

42:11.502 --> 42:14.137
to the company
of other horses.

42:14.203 --> 42:16.204
Now look at him.

42:16.271 --> 42:17.771
A few hours later it's like
I don't even exist.

42:17.839 --> 42:19.573
God, typical teenager.

42:19.640 --> 42:20.940
Both:
(Laughing)

42:21.975 --> 42:24.544
Hey, look on the bright side.
It just gives you and I

42:24.611 --> 42:27.747
a chance to get
reacquainted.

42:27.812 --> 42:28.912
(Giggling)

42:28.979 --> 42:30.447
Hey, I called Scott.

42:30.515 --> 42:33.683
I told him I'd take the job
at the racetrack.

42:33.750 --> 42:36.718
It's just a few hours
first thing in the morning

42:36.785 --> 42:38.053
five days a week.

42:38.119 --> 42:39.353
You know, there is plenty
of work to do here.

42:39.422 --> 42:41.289
I...

42:41.356 --> 42:43.857
I need more money for school,
Amy.

42:43.924 --> 42:45.557
And hey, you know,

42:45.624 --> 42:50.395
maybe it'll be good for us
not working together 24/7.

42:50.711 --> 42:52.679
What do you think?

42:52.746 --> 42:56.949
Well, I think you need
to do what feels right.

43:04.020 --> 43:05.086
Scott: Sorry I couldn't
do this sooner.

43:05.154 --> 43:07.356
Thanks for looking after him,
Jack.

43:07.423 --> 43:08.956
I'm just glad as hell
to see it go.

43:09.023 --> 43:10.691
We'll finally
get some sleep.

43:10.758 --> 43:11.658
(Cub purrs)

43:19.398 --> 43:20.832
Bye, Tuffy.

43:21.465 --> 43:22.398
Tuffy?

43:23.767 --> 43:24.834
Shut up.

43:32.640 --> 43:35.775
Scott: You get to ride shot gun...
Tuffy.

43:40.612 --> 43:41.979
Oh, I hope you don't mind,

43:42.046 --> 43:44.147
but I brought you
a few more orphans.

43:44.215 --> 43:45.816
Absolutely not!

43:45.883 --> 43:48.184
Ty and Amy:
Absolutely not.

43:48.251 --> 43:49.818
(Chicks chirping)

43:49.884 --> 43:51.585
Mallory:
Oh my gosh!

43:51.653 --> 43:54.521
A box of baby charlottes!
Thank you!

43:54.588 --> 43:57.756
Okay, you two, uh,
it's time.

43:57.823 --> 43:59.057

43:59.124 --> 44:00.325
Ty and Amy:
(Chuckling)

Ty: It's all right, Merlin.
Come on.

(Horse snuffles)

44:05.562 --> 44:06.929
<i>Come on, Merlin.</i>

44:06.997 --> 44:08.197
Mallory: Dr.
Kirk says it's healthy to know when

44:08.264 --> 44:10.832
to let your baby
leave the nest.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.500
He does.
