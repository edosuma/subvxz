No. They didn't work.

49:47.693 --> 49:51.905
We had to obtain
some indigenous leeches.

something real.

52:48.582 --> 52:50.750
It's like some sort
of alien transmission.

What's the difference
between a god and an alien?

52:59.092 --> 53:02.679

prove yourself?

53:05.640 --> 53:07.058
What do you mean?

53:07.142 --> 53:10.896
In the scriptures,
Sol always asks atheists

53:10.896 --> 53:14.107
to prove themselves
before he helps them.

53:18.194 --> 53:19.946
He didn't ask me
for anything.
