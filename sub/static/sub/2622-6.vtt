WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:06.588
- Thanks for the tasty dinner.
- You're welcome for a tasty dinner.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.757
What are you guys looking at?

00:08.967 --> 00:11.552
Ross and the most
beautiful girl in the world.

00:11.761 --> 00:13.595
Yeah, come to Papa!

00:19.060 --> 00:20.436
I know!

00:22.522 --> 00:24.523
Probably the only time
I'll say this...

00:24.733 --> 00:27.067
...but did you see the ass on her?

00:27.318 --> 00:29.570
What did you?
When did you?

00:29.821 --> 00:32.740
How did you?
How did you get a girl like that?

00:33.950 --> 00:38.245
So what is she, like a spokesmodel?
An aerobics instructor?

00:38.455 --> 00:41.790
Actually, she's a paleontology
doctoral candidate...

00:42.000 --> 00:44.168
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.046
But that's, like, the easiest era.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.341
I've seen her at work,
but I always figured...

00:53.762 --> 00:56.263
But, uh, I made her dinner.

00:56.556 --> 00:59.975
We had a great time.
And we're going out again tomorrow.

01:02.437 --> 01:06.356
Maybe her friends are betting to see
who gets the biggest geek.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.942
Fine by me. Hope she wins.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.159
Hey!

01:59.369 --> 02:01.203
You have any wrapping paper?

02:01.412 --> 02:03.038
Is it for my birthday present?

02:03.915 --> 02:05.874
It was your birthday months ago.

02:06.459 --> 02:11.213
You said you ordered something special
and it just hadn't come yet.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.092
I have a call in about that.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.302
Oh. Okay.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.390
It's for Kathy. It's an early copy
of her favorite book.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.101
Oh! The Velveteen Rabbit!

02:24.394 --> 02:27.062
When the boy's love
makes the rabbit real...

02:27.272 --> 02:30.691
Don't touch it, because
your fingers have destructive oils.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.778
Then you'd better keep it away
from Ross' hair.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.241
This is pretty rare.
How did you get that?

02:39.409 --> 02:42.077
No big deal.
I just went to some bookstores...

02:42.245 --> 02:46.582
...talked to some dealers, called
some of the author's grandchildren.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.500
Honey, that's so sweet.

02:48.751 --> 02:53.422
What a great way to say, "I secretly
love you, roommate's girlfriend."

02:54.591 --> 02:56.091
It doesn't say that.

02:56.759 --> 02:57.759
Does it?

02:58.428 --> 03:02.723
How will it look when you get her
something incredibly meaningful...

03:02.932 --> 03:06.935
...and expensive, and her boyfriend,
Joey, gives her an orange?

03:07.437 --> 03:10.772
I'll make sure Joey gets her
something really great.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.108
It's got to be better than that book.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.152
Ooh! Like a crossbow!

03:17.488 --> 03:19.114
Once again, I am sorry.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.116
Thank you. Bye.

03:22.452 --> 03:26.121
I had to turn down a job
catering a funeral for 60 people.

03:26.497 --> 03:29.291
Oh, my God! What happened?

03:29.834 --> 03:31.460
Sixty guests.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.132
Why'd you have to turn it down?

03:37.300 --> 03:39.635
I don't have the money or equipment...

03:39.844 --> 03:43.305
...to handle something that big
on such short notice.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.807
Wow, what is with all the negativity?

03:46.351 --> 03:49.311
You sound like "Moni-can't,"
not "Moni-can"!

03:51.064 --> 03:52.564
Moni-ca.

03:54.150 --> 03:57.569
You've been playing around
with this catering for years.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.405
- Do you want to be a caterer?
- I don't know.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.574
There you go! That's the spirit!

04:04.202 --> 04:08.080
If you need money, I will lend
you money. Just get moving!

04:08.331 --> 04:11.833
Really? I'd need $500
for all the food and supplies.

04:12.043 --> 04:16.672
It's worth it if it'll get you moving.
You haven't worked in months!

04:16.839 --> 04:17.880
Neither have you.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.509
Yes, but I'm doing this.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.220
That would be great! Thank you.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.306
- Hey!
- Hey!

04:28.017 --> 04:29.810
Can I borrow your apartment keys?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.019
Why?

04:34.691 --> 04:35.857
You can pee here.

04:38.528 --> 04:43.031
Ha-ha-ha. Yes, I can, of course.
Excuse me.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.368
It's okay.
The duck's using our bathroom anyway.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.873
What are you getting
for her birthday?

04:52.083 --> 04:54.710
We've been dating a couple weeks.
I got to get her something?

04:54.877 --> 04:56.003
Yes!

04:56.170 --> 04:58.964
Yes! You have to get her
something really nice.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.259
- I know!
- And not one of your coupons...

05:02.468 --> 05:04.261
...for an hour of "Joey Love."

05:10.268 --> 05:11.601
Ooh! A crossword! Can I help?

05:11.894 --> 05:13.061
No!

05:13.396 --> 05:15.605
Last week I got all
but three answers...

05:15.857 --> 05:18.400
...and I want to finish one
without any help.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.818
Fine.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.739
But you can't help me develop
my new universal language.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.867
- Hey!
- How'd it go?

05:27.076 --> 05:30.078
Oh, my God!
It was the best funeral ever!

05:30.997 --> 05:32.914
Everyone loved the food.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.584
I even got another funeral
for tomorrow.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.086
The dead guy from today's best friend.

05:38.463 --> 05:42.132
It's like I am the official caterer
for that accident.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.301
Mon, I'm so happy for you!

05:44.510 --> 05:47.262
Thanks.
Check out my new catering stuff.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.765
Look! I'm an omelet station!

05:50.141 --> 05:52.851
- Omelet? Made to order?
- Ha!

05:53.019 --> 05:55.479
I'll have one, please.
Plus my money.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.023
Oh...

05:58.191 --> 06:00.609
I didn't realize
you needed it right away.

06:00.818 --> 06:04.321
You told me to go and be a caterer.
So I went. I be'd.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.991
I used it to buy all this stuff.

06:08.284 --> 06:11.620
I got another job tomorrow,
so I'll pay you back then.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.123
Oh! Okay.
Sorry I acted like a bank.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.678
Um, would you like to come in?

06:29.347 --> 06:33.183
Did Homo erectus hunt
with wooden tools?

06:34.727 --> 06:36.603
According to recent findings.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.242
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!

06:50.827 --> 06:53.662
Uh, Mitzi is?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.664
My hamster.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.834
I hope she's okay.
I haven't seen her in a while.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.877
Have a seat.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.462
Where?

07:03.589 --> 07:05.674
Uh, oh! Do you, uh...?

07:10.263 --> 07:13.223
Do you have any, um,
Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

07:13.474 --> 07:16.017
- What?
- Well, I do.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.522
Let's go back to my place,
light a couple candles...

07:20.731 --> 07:24.526
...break open a box
of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

07:26.070 --> 07:29.197
- I'd rather not.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

07:29.365 --> 07:33.034
Okay, um...
Don't take this the wrong way...

07:33.244 --> 07:36.705
...but your place kind of
has a weird smell.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.215
- Is everything in the car?
- Did you settle the bill?

07:47.383 --> 07:49.718
No. I hate this part.

07:50.094 --> 07:53.013
Ooh! Oh! Look what we almost left!

07:53.222 --> 07:55.223
- That's not mine.
- Oh.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.726
Ooh. Look what we almost took!

08:05.109 --> 08:06.735
Excuse me, Ms. Burkart?

08:07.236 --> 08:08.904
Well, we're all cleaned up.

08:09.071 --> 08:12.532
Oh. Good. Thank you.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.535
Um, ahem...

08:16.037 --> 08:19.915
And, well, there's
this small matter of the, um...

08:20.917 --> 08:22.751
- Dear?
- The matter of...

08:24.086 --> 08:25.170
...payment.

08:26.297 --> 08:30.091
Jack used to handle the finances.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.272
You know what we should all do?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.608
Go see a musical.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.612
Sure.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.323
You know which one?

08:54.617 --> 08:57.494
The 1996 Tony Award winner.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.331
Do you know the name of that one?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.125
I don't know, um, Grease?

09:05.586 --> 09:07.170
No.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.340
Rent?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.634
Yes! Rent!

09:13.594 --> 09:15.095
So when do you want to go?

09:15.304 --> 09:17.722
What? I'm sorry. I can't, I'm busy.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.978
Hey...

09:23.145 --> 09:27.566
Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. Ugh!

09:27.733 --> 09:30.819
Yes, it is, at Office Max!

09:32.989 --> 09:34.406
What did you get her?

09:35.741 --> 09:37.492
A pen.

09:38.494 --> 09:42.914
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock. Huh?

09:44.166 --> 09:46.835
- Ha, ha. You can't give her that.
- Why not?

09:47.128 --> 09:48.336
She's not 11!

09:50.047 --> 09:52.674
And it's not the seventh night
of Chanukah.

09:55.261 --> 09:59.180
What he means by that is,
while this is a very nice gift...

09:59.432 --> 10:02.017
...maybe it's not something
a boyfriend gives.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.518
Sure, it is.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.020
She needs a pen for work.

10:05.271 --> 10:09.774
She's writing. She turns it over.
"Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"

10:11.861 --> 10:16.072
All right. What did you get
for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.366
She didn't have one.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.869
For three years?

10:23.372 --> 10:26.207
Look, it's too late,
and I got an audition.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.418
I can't shop anymore.

10:30.046 --> 10:33.381
I will go out
and try to find something for her.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.216
Thanks, man.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.553
While you're at it,
could you get her a card?

10:39.263 --> 10:42.432
Would you like me to write her
a little poem as well?

10:42.683 --> 10:46.061
Or just get a card
that has a poem already in it.

10:48.606 --> 10:52.233
- Oh! You have to get our money.
- She couldn't stop crying.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.945
With those thick glasses,
her tears look giant.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.614
I know, it's tough.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.992
You know what the first thing I did
after my mom's funeral was?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.078
- What?
- Pay the caterer!

11:04.205 --> 11:05.580
I've had a lot of jobs.

11:05.790 --> 11:09.751
And there are some people
who always try to get out of paying.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.587
It's either "That massage
wasn't long enough"...

11:12.838 --> 11:15.090
...or "I don't know
any of those songs"...

11:15.257 --> 11:19.302
...or "These sombreros aren't
big enough. Bad little white girl!"

11:20.346 --> 11:21.638
Okay.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.598
So you think she's faking?

11:23.849 --> 11:27.435
There weren't any tears
till you showed her the bill.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.604
She sounded pretty upset to me.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.440
You're a grand old flag

11:32.608 --> 11:36.736
You're a high-flying flag
And forever in peace may you wave

11:37.279 --> 11:39.447
She seems fine now.

11:46.163 --> 11:49.332
So you just left?
Her place was really that bad?

11:49.542 --> 11:53.253
You throw your jacket on a chair
at the end of the day.

11:53.504 --> 11:57.298
Like that, only instead of a chair,
it's a pile of garbage.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.886
And instead of a jacket,
it's a pile of garbage.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.766
And instead of the end of
the day, it's the end of time...

12:06.976 --> 12:09.269
...and garbage is all
that has survived.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.815
- Here.
- Wow. Thanks.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.192
So, uh, what happened?

12:16.402 --> 12:18.695
Nothing. I had to get out of there.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.322
Next time, you take her
to your place.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.325
I tried that.
She says it has a weird smell.

12:25.494 --> 12:28.830
- What kind of smell?
- I don't know. Soap?

12:29.498 --> 12:31.791
- Listen, you like this girl, right?
- Yeah.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.918
- You want to see her again?
- Yeah.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.880
So you're going to have
to do it in the mess!

12:38.007 --> 12:40.675
Yeah, okay. You're right.

12:40.843 --> 12:44.345
I mean, uh, who cares about
a little sloppiness?

12:44.513 --> 12:46.181
Yeah.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.850
- It's endearing, really.
- All right!

12:49.101 --> 12:52.061
Now you go get that beautiful pig!

13:01.947 --> 13:05.450
I just spent the entire
afternoon looking for a present...

13:05.701 --> 13:08.495
...for Kathy that would be
better than the rabbit.

13:08.662 --> 13:09.662
Any luck?

13:09.830 --> 13:14.250
Yeah, I found this great place
called "Invisible Things for Kathy."

13:14.543 --> 13:17.378
Can you give me a hand
with all this stuff?

13:17.713 --> 13:21.216
Just return the book,
let Joey give her the clock pen...

13:21.425 --> 13:24.219
...and you get her
something worse than that...

13:24.428 --> 13:25.762
...like a regular pen.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.766
She's really going
to love this, you know?

13:30.392 --> 13:33.061
The bottom line is,
I want her to have it...

13:33.229 --> 13:36.606
...even if I don't get to be
the one who gives it to her.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.775
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.

13:38.984 --> 13:42.237
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?

13:42.571 --> 13:44.280
Oh, "pathetic"!

13:46.951 --> 13:50.495
Hey! I've been looking
all over for you.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.998
- Where?
- Our place. The hall.

13:57.753 --> 13:58.920
I got something.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.679
It's a book.

14:08.639 --> 14:09.764
A book?

14:11.433 --> 14:13.768
Is it a book that's also a safe?

14:16.272 --> 14:18.022
It's a book that's just a book.

14:18.274 --> 14:22.110
It's The Velveteen Rabbit.
It was her favorite as a kid.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.821
So, uh, just let me know
if she likes it, okay?

14:25.030 --> 14:26.114
You got it.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.616
Thanks for doing this. I owe you one.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.498
There wasn't any change
from that twenty, was there?

14:36.292 --> 14:39.002
No, it came out to an even twenty.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.798
Wow. That's almost
as much as a new book.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.097
Jeepers Creepers

14:51.265 --> 14:52.974
Where'd you get those peepers?

14:53.142 --> 14:56.769
Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?

14:56.937 --> 14:57.937
You didn't get the money?

14:58.105 --> 15:00.648
Maybe I can try at intermission?

15:01.483 --> 15:03.318
You know what? Let's just go.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.571
No! Hey!
We're not leaving till we get paid!

15:06.822 --> 15:08.865
I don't know who she thinks she is.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.950
Enough is enough!

15:11.994 --> 15:13.453
Hey, widow?

15:14.830 --> 15:17.790
Widow? Excuse me? Excuse me!

15:20.085 --> 15:24.339
Thanks. Um, clearly this is
a very, very hard time for you.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.842
Um, but we provided a service,
and we deserve to be paid...

15:28.010 --> 15:29.969
...because you ate that service.

15:30.179 --> 15:34.474
We are not leaving here until
we are paid every penny, because...

15:34.683 --> 15:38.853
...we're part-time caterers
and we have no place else to go.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.565
All right. I'll get my bag.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.067
Good.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.410
I'm going to leave some cards here.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.707
Please think of us
for your next event.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.382
You want to come inside?

16:08.550 --> 16:09.759
Yes.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.805
Yes, I do.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.275
I'll be right back.
Make yourself comfortable.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.636
- Guess who.
- Uh...

16:53.804 --> 16:56.347
Department of Sanitation?

16:57.599 --> 17:00.226
- It's me.
- Ha, oh!

17:10.612 --> 17:12.488
Aw!

17:13.281 --> 17:14.490
What?

17:14.657 --> 17:17.492
- Oh, Cheryl!
- Oh, Ross!

17:18.787 --> 17:21.204
Oh! Oh!

17:26.962 --> 17:28.838
Oh! God!

17:30.215 --> 17:32.508
Aah! Oh, my God!

17:36.638 --> 17:38.598
No! No!

17:39.016 --> 17:41.392
It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!

17:41.643 --> 17:45.313
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
I must have freaked out.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.106
Thank God it's not Mitzi!

17:48.192 --> 17:49.984
It's just a rat.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.490
I did it! Aah!

17:55.657 --> 17:58.743
I finished it! I did it all by myself!

17:58.994 --> 18:00.870
And there's nobody to hug.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.790
Move!

18:09.296 --> 18:11.214
Hey! Hey, you guys!

18:11.507 --> 18:13.633
I finished it all by myself!
Hug me.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.426
Yay! So good!

18:16.428 --> 18:18.221
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.639
How did it go?

18:19.848 --> 18:23.851
The widow wouldn't pay, so
Phoebe yelled at her till she did.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.229
I'm a hard-ass.

18:28.148 --> 18:31.526
And I'm a wuss.
We should be partners.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.529
Hard-ass and wuss.
We could fight crime.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.199
Wait a minute, Phoebe.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.409
We should be partners.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.745
We should be catering partners.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.707
You're not working now,
and we have a great time together.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.585
- Okay.
- I cook and you take care of the money.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.963
Oh! It'll be like
I have a wife in the '50s!

18:57.427 --> 18:58.803
- Hey.
- Hey!

18:59.054 --> 19:00.721
How did she like the gift?

19:00.889 --> 19:03.808
She loved it.
She's showing the girls right now.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.226
Yeah? That's great.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.769
I got to tell you...

19:06.979 --> 19:09.897
...I feel bad taking credit
for this, because...

19:10.107 --> 19:12.150
...am I going to get
a lot of credit for this!

19:17.739 --> 19:18.781
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.117
Hey. Happy birthday.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.743
Thank you.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.246
You know, uh,
Chandler got you a gift too.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.082
No, he didn't.

19:29.918 --> 19:33.337
Yeah, he did. Look,
it's right there on the counter. Ho, ho!

19:40.262 --> 19:41.762
Happy birthday.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.015
I'm sorry.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.269
You really didn't have to.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.272
- Wow!
- See...

19:51.440 --> 19:55.818
You think it's just a pen, but you
turn it over and it's also a clock.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.779
Really? No, this is great!

19:59.531 --> 20:02.033
- Thank you, Chandler.
- Oh. Yeah.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.118
Aw. Heh.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.370
Want to go to bed?

20:07.289 --> 20:09.457
I'll be in, in a minute.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.130
Oh, uh... Don't forget your coupon.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.471
Good night.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.475
Um, thank you for the gift.

20:27.851 --> 20:32.647
Oh, uh, I just knew that
sometimes when you're writing...

20:32.856 --> 20:35.650
...you don't always
know the exact time.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.321
No, I didn't mean the pen.
Thank you for the book.

20:41.823 --> 20:42.907
Uh, the book?

20:43.158 --> 20:44.700
The Velveteen Rabbit?

20:44.910 --> 20:47.828
I have a feeling you had
something to do with it.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.288
What do you mean?

20:49.790 --> 20:51.832
When Joey gave it to me he said:

20:52.042 --> 20:56.587
"This is because I know you like rabbits,
and I know you like cheese."

20:59.341 --> 21:01.175
Thanks. I love it.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.386
I know how hard
it must have been for you to find.

21:05.681 --> 21:09.684
In case you missed that,
that sound was, "Oh, well."

21:10.435 --> 21:13.729
You must really like Joey
to go to all that trouble.

21:14.022 --> 21:15.439
Oh, yeah. He's my...

21:20.445 --> 21:22.697
He's my best friend.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.867
- Well...
- Good night.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.422
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

21:50.058 --> 21:53.394
Hi, uh, you don't know me.
I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.856
You know, it's too bad
that didn't work out.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.400
Anyway, he told me
about your apartment.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.570
Well, I couldn't sleep
thinking about it.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.825
So, uh, would it be okay
if I cleaned it?

22:09.870 --> 22:11.120
No?
