Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

00:02.348 --> 00:03.519
Katrina Bennett.

00:03.520 --> 00:04.787
She comes in,
she takes over,

00:04.854 --> 00:06.294
She acts like everything
is her idea.

00:06.356 --> 00:08.124
This wasn't
about a job for me.

00:08.191 --> 00:10.126
It was about having a life,

00:10.193 --> 00:12.128
But I guess
you wouldn't understand that.

00:12.195 --> 00:14.797
So you're gonna punish me
by giving me to Louis?

00:14.864 --> 00:15.998
Because you and I are done.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.667
You make me want
to be a better man.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.970
I can't let you do this.

00:22.839 --> 00:25.207
I regret where we are,

00:25.258 --> 00:27.843
And I've been trying to get us
back to where we were.

00:27.894 --> 00:29.678
You're suggesting
bribing a man

00:29.730 --> 00:31.210
to get you out
of your bribery charge.

00:31.214 --> 00:35.017
"In for a penny, in for
a pound," mother always said.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.885
Ava Hessington
doesn't plead no contest.

00:36.937 --> 00:37.937
She pleads guilty.

00:38.021 --> 00:39.321
And you get
to call it a win.

00:39.389 --> 00:41.824
I can beat you, and I did.

00:41.891 --> 00:43.776
You put me
in that position again,

00:43.860 --> 00:46.362
and I'll do
whatever I have to do to win.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.748
Are you saying screw this
deal, let's kick his ass?

00:48.832 --> 00:51.534
I'm saying take the deal.
We already did.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.570
I win, you back me
for managing partner.

00:54.621 --> 00:56.238
You want
to take down Jessica.

00:56.289 --> 00:57.540
I do.

What time
are you coming over?

01:15.892 --> 01:19.278
Um, I thought
we were doing my place.

01:19.362 --> 01:21.597
No, because whenever
I'm at your place,

01:21.648 --> 01:24.700
all I can see is Tess
in a bed sheet.

01:24.767 --> 01:26.202
I'll be there at 9:00.

01:31.541 --> 01:33.442
Bran bars are forbidden
to first years.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.494
- Since when?
- Since two seconds ago.

01:35.579 --> 01:37.079
Order of the quartermaster,

01:37.130 --> 01:38.664
who is no longer
speaking with you.

01:38.748 --> 01:40.499
Rachel.
Hmm?

01:40.584 --> 01:41.967
Can you please instruct
the associate to your right

01:42.052 --> 01:43.952
to pass
the nondairy creamer?

01:44.004 --> 01:46.121
Louis, as I have been trying
to tell you in person,

01:46.173 --> 01:48.123
and in the note I left,

01:48.175 --> 01:50.893
and in your voice mail,

01:50.960 --> 01:52.428
I'm sorry.

01:52.479 --> 01:53.846
Do you know what
nondairy creamer is, Rachel?

01:53.930 --> 01:55.181
- Uh--
- It's a metaphor.

01:55.265 --> 01:56.899
The first sip, you think
it's real, you know?

01:56.966 --> 01:58.184
After all,
it wants you to believe

01:58.268 --> 01:59.935
that it's genuine
and it's good,

01:59.986 --> 02:02.137
and it's gonna deliver
on its promise.

02:02.189 --> 02:03.572
But then with time,

02:03.640 --> 02:05.680
you realize that it's
just a concoction of chemicals

02:05.742 --> 02:07.326
that's designed
to disguise the truth

02:07.410 --> 02:08.828
that it's actually
full of shit.

02:08.912 --> 02:10.196
Then why
are you drinking it?

02:10.280 --> 02:12.748
I'm lactose intolerant.

02:24.327 --> 02:25.261
I don't accept.

02:25.328 --> 02:26.629
Don't accept what?

02:26.680 --> 02:28.600
Whatever bullshit apology
you're here to give me.

02:28.632 --> 02:29.849
You gave me your word,

02:29.933 --> 02:31.413
and the second
you found out that Mike

02:31.434 --> 02:33.519
was actually gonna say yes,
you couldn't stand it.

02:33.603 --> 02:34.720
You sold me out.

02:34.804 --> 02:36.204
I'm not here
to give you an apology.

02:36.223 --> 02:39.024
I'm here to give you a case.

02:40.277 --> 02:41.810
Those are
the Hessington oil files.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.011
Yeah, you know what, Harvey?

02:43.063 --> 02:44.563
I don't want
your sloppy seconds.

02:44.648 --> 02:46.282
That takeover attempt's
gonna be dead in the water

02:46.349 --> 02:48.284
the second that Ava Hessington's
settlement goes public.

02:48.351 --> 02:50.319
Tony Gianopolous isn't
going to just sell his shares

02:50.370 --> 02:51.654
and go away.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.821
You're right.
You know what he's gonna do?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.206
He's gonna
leverage his position,

02:54.291 --> 02:55.958
and he's gonna get
as much greenmail as he can.

02:56.025 --> 02:57.660
Which is exactly
why I'm here.

02:57.711 --> 03:01.046
You're better suited
to beat him back than I am.

03:01.131 --> 03:02.464
You think I don't know that?

03:02.532 --> 03:06.335
I know you know it.
I want you to know I know it.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.975
Leave the box.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.514
Louis,
have you given any thought

03:18.565 --> 03:19.932
to a rebound associate?

03:20.016 --> 03:22.551
Harvey, come on, you know
I'm not that kind of guy.

03:22.602 --> 03:25.988
Come on, you have him
file a few interrogatories,

03:26.055 --> 03:28.023
maybe pick up your dry cleaning,
and then you cut him loose.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.525
With no strings attached?

03:29.576 --> 03:32.861
Better men than you
have done it.

03:32.913 --> 03:33.996
No.

03:34.063 --> 03:35.998
- Yep.
- Who, Baird?

03:36.065 --> 03:39.118
A week-long fling
I ended six days too late.

03:39.202 --> 03:40.536
Yeah, but Harvey,

03:40.587 --> 03:42.748
I don't just want a superficial
relationship, you know?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.506
I want a true mentee.

03:44.574 --> 03:46.342
Someone I can take
to the gun club or mudding

03:46.409 --> 03:47.793
or to the origami festival.

03:47.877 --> 03:51.096
Louis, you're gonna find
the right one.

03:54.351 --> 03:57.419
Origami festival?
Oh, my God.

04:09.232 --> 04:12.234
Well, this is a surprise.

04:12.285 --> 04:14.486
What?

04:14.571 --> 04:18.273
I just never thought I'd see
the great Harriet Specter

04:18.325 --> 04:20.409
making her own copies.

04:23.296 --> 04:26.215
Is that
what this thing does?

04:26.282 --> 04:28.050
You've never made a copy
in your life before, have you?

04:28.117 --> 04:30.502
Of course not,
I'm too busy being a badass

04:30.587 --> 04:31.754
and worrying about my hair.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.006
And your brilliant associate,
Michelle Ross,

04:34.090 --> 04:36.508
does all the hard work
for you anyway.

04:36.593 --> 04:38.894
You're goddamn right
she does.

04:38.961 --> 04:41.730
I'm really sorry

04:41.798 --> 04:44.400
for what I said
about having a life.

04:44.467 --> 04:47.102
I know.

04:47.153 --> 04:49.355
So we're good?

04:49.439 --> 04:50.439
We're good.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.441
And you and Mike,
you're good?

04:52.492 --> 04:53.942
Do you really think
that Harvey

04:53.994 --> 04:55.911
had an emotional epiphany
on his own?

04:55.978 --> 04:57.613
So you did forgive him?

04:57.664 --> 04:58.914
Yes.

04:58.981 --> 05:00.249
Well, he doesn't know that.

05:00.316 --> 05:03.168
Which is why I have
a triple-whip, double-fat,

05:03.253 --> 05:06.038
extra shot mocha latte
with caramel.

05:06.122 --> 05:07.489
Fair enough.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.425
But maybe it's time
you told him.

05:09.492 --> 05:11.260
So you decided
not to go back to London?

05:11.327 --> 05:13.178
Well, we have some
unfinished business to discuss,

05:13.263 --> 05:14.880
and I thought it best
to do it in person.

05:14.964 --> 05:16.131
The takeover attempt.

05:16.182 --> 05:18.050
Tony Gianopolous.

05:18.134 --> 05:20.686
Well, I've assigned it
to another attorney,

05:20.770 --> 05:24.523
but before you express
any concern, he's excellent.

05:24.607 --> 05:27.476
Well, not only
do I not have concerns,

05:27.527 --> 05:29.645
I'm glad
you've handed it off.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.480
And why is that?

05:31.531 --> 05:33.615
Because that way I know you'll
trust the man you're overseeing

05:33.683 --> 05:37.319
when you come and work for me.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.405
I have to say,
I'm flattered.

05:39.489 --> 05:40.689
I don't want you
to be flattered.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.708
I want you to say yes.

05:42.792 --> 05:45.210
As much success as I've had
with that line myself,

05:45.295 --> 05:48.029
I'm afraid
I'm not an oilman.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.498
The oil business
is about oil

05:49.549 --> 05:52.334
as much as you being
a lawyer is about the law.

05:52.385 --> 05:54.803
Every day is a knife fight
in a prison yard,

05:54.871 --> 05:58.223
and something tells me
you like a good knife fight.

05:58.308 --> 05:59.758
No rules in a knife fight.

05:59.843 --> 06:02.594
Harvey, I've just lost
my number two.

06:02.679 --> 06:05.347
I can't think of anyone better
to replace him.

06:05.398 --> 06:06.515
Ava

06:06.566 --> 06:08.183
I'm a woman
who gets what I want,

06:08.234 --> 06:10.235
and I am willing
to pay for it.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.721
Don't get me wrong,
I'm happy to whore myself out.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.274
I just prefer to have
more than one client.

06:15.358 --> 06:18.077
Harvey, what a coincidence.

06:18.161 --> 06:20.446
Cameron, I'm surprised
you can afford this place

06:20.530 --> 06:22.331
now that
you're unemployed again.

06:22.398 --> 06:24.950
Well, my temporary gig
isn't over just yet.

06:25.034 --> 06:27.903
You may think
you have them fooled, Cameron,

06:27.954 --> 06:30.071
but they'll figure you out
eventually.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.072
You didn't.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.374
What are you talking about?

06:32.425 --> 06:34.209
Ava Hessington,
you're under arrest.

06:34.260 --> 06:35.794
- What?
- On what charge?

06:35.879 --> 06:38.079
Conspiracy
to commit murder.

06:41.050 --> 06:43.251
This is bullshit, Cameron.
We had a deal.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.586
A deal where your client

06:44.637 --> 06:47.389
admitted to bribing
a foreign official.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.224
That Colonel
that she paid off?

06:49.275 --> 06:51.760
After that, six people
were killed by his troops.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.530
I give my driver a tip,
and then he runs over someone.

06:54.597 --> 06:56.365
Doesn't mean I had
anything to do with it.

06:56.432 --> 06:58.033
But if the person
he hit was me,

06:58.100 --> 06:59.568
sure would look like that.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.787
What the hell
are you talking about?

07:01.871 --> 07:03.622
All six people
did whatever they could

07:03.706 --> 07:05.824
to stop your client
from getting her pipeline.

07:05.909 --> 07:07.659
If that's all you got,
you don't have shit.

07:07.744 --> 07:09.378
She did this, Harvey.
You don't know her.

07:09.445 --> 07:10.946
Yeah, but I know you,

07:10.997 --> 07:11.997
and you don't give a damn

07:12.081 --> 07:14.049
about murder
in some foreign country.

07:14.116 --> 07:15.751
You took this case
to stick it to me.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.419
And I did.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.921
She admitted that was a bribe

07:18.972 --> 07:20.422
because she never thought we
would tie her to those deaths,

07:20.473 --> 07:21.473
and now I got her.

07:21.558 --> 07:22.679
And you didn't
see it coming,

07:22.759 --> 07:26.812

you can do about it.

What do you need me to do?

08:11.871 --> 08:13.088
Whatever you have to
to get Ava out,

08:13.156 --> 08:14.623
because Cameron's gonna
try and keep her in.

08:14.674 --> 08:16.208
You really think he's gonna
try and deny her bail?

08:16.292 --> 08:17.593
- I know it.
- Harvey, one thing.

08:17.660 --> 08:19.261
Hey, look, if you have
a problem defending someone

08:19.328 --> 08:21.630
who's accused of murder,
I don't want to hear it.

08:21.681 --> 08:23.265
Look, you won't, 'cause I'm
willing to do whatever it takes

08:23.332 --> 08:26.552
to win
whether she's innocent or not.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.604
Then come with me.

08:28.671 --> 08:30.806
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm going to see Ava with you?

08:30.857 --> 08:32.191
- Yep.
- Yeah, baby!

08:32.275 --> 08:33.609
Butch and Sundance are back.

08:33.676 --> 08:35.443
Ooh, no go.

08:35.510 --> 08:37.279
What do--what do--
what do you mean, "no go"?

08:37.346 --> 08:38.785
I mean, you're not
butch or Sundance.

08:38.847 --> 08:39.782
Why not?

08:39.849 --> 08:41.015
'Cause Butch was the leader,

08:41.067 --> 08:43.118
and Sundance was the gunslinger,
and I'm both.

08:43.186 --> 08:44.686
Okay, but Sundance
couldn't swim,

08:44.738 --> 08:47.239
and Butch never shot anyone,
so that makes you a loser.

08:47.323 --> 08:48.490
Better than a fraud.

08:48.541 --> 08:49.708
I think it's time
for some new material.

08:49.793 --> 08:51.693
You write
<i>Midnight Train to Georgia,</i>

08:51.745 --> 08:53.245
you don't just
sing it once.

08:53.329 --> 08:57.249
And speaking of Butch Cassidy,
let's go start a knife fight.

08:57.333 --> 08:58.717
Uh, Norma,

08:58.802 --> 09:02.037
I just want you, from now on,
to just try to wear socks,

09:02.088 --> 09:05.307
because if you--
there isn't--

09:08.595 --> 09:09.711
and what is that?

09:09.763 --> 09:11.346
Hessington oil's earnings
per share

09:11.398 --> 09:14.983
and market cap growth
over the last 11.2 years.

09:15.051 --> 09:17.152
Somebody ask you
to do this?

09:17.220 --> 09:19.238
I didn't do it because
somebody asked me to, Louis.

09:19.322 --> 09:23.492
I did it
because I want in on the case.

09:23.559 --> 09:25.277
You know, you realize
something like this

09:25.361 --> 09:27.496
would entail
working hand in glove

09:27.563 --> 09:31.617
and possibly even
a trip or two to the mud club.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.169
I'm in.

09:34.237 --> 09:35.170
And what makes you think
you're good enough

09:35.238 --> 09:36.505
to be my personal associate?

09:36.572 --> 09:38.674
I don't want to be
your personal associate.

09:38.741 --> 09:41.076
- What?
- I'm a fifth year.

09:41.127 --> 09:43.345
I don't want to be
anyone's personal associate,

09:43.413 --> 09:47.015
but I know how good you are,
you know how good I am.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.133
We can use each other.

09:48.218 --> 09:52.020
Hmm.
Like a symbiotic relationship.

09:52.088 --> 09:53.555
Like between a phytoplankton
and a whale.

09:53.606 --> 09:56.692
I'm not familiar
with their specific dynamic,

09:56.759 --> 09:58.310
but, yes, exactly.

09:58.394 --> 10:01.563
Well, Katrina, I kind of
had enough of being used

10:01.614 --> 10:03.694
by associates looking to move
one rung up the ladder,

10:03.700 --> 10:05.818
so I suggest you get
the hell out of my office

10:05.902 --> 10:08.403
and find yourself
another whale.

10:17.797 --> 10:20.499
Did you know
about these murders?

10:20.583 --> 10:22.584
I knew there was
a demonstration,

10:22.635 --> 10:25.387
it turned ugly,
and that people died.

10:25.454 --> 10:26.472
Did you know those people

10:26.556 --> 10:27.890
were the leaders
of the demonstration?

10:27.957 --> 10:29.091
No.

10:29.142 --> 10:30.592
Did you know the military
was responsible?

10:30.643 --> 10:33.512
All I know about these deaths
is that they happened.

10:33.596 --> 10:35.264
On your land.

10:35.315 --> 10:38.684
We own thousands of acres.
It's a volatile country.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.652
People kill each other
on a regular basis.

10:40.737 --> 10:41.904
So you just chalk it up
to coincidence

10:41.971 --> 10:44.273
that the six leaders
of this demonstration,

10:44.324 --> 10:47.159
against
your company's policies,

10:47.243 --> 10:49.995
on your company's
private property, were murdered?

10:50.079 --> 10:53.248
It was reported as
a combat incident, not a murder.

10:53.316 --> 10:54.316
You just said all you know
about these deaths

10:54.367 --> 10:55.584
is that they happened.

10:55.651 --> 10:56.835
Now you know
it was a combat incident.

10:56.920 --> 10:57.920
Which one is it?

10:57.987 --> 10:59.371
Harvey,
what the hell is this,

10:59.455 --> 11:00.706
and who the hell
does he think he is?

11:00.790 --> 11:02.824
Mike's just doing his job.

11:02.876 --> 11:04.343
Well, Mike,

11:04.427 --> 11:07.713
every death in that country is
reported as a combat incident,

11:07.797 --> 11:09.497
and for your information,

11:09.549 --> 11:11.934
there were thousands of people
opposed to our pipeline.

11:12.001 --> 11:14.436
That's all we need
right now.

11:18.608 --> 11:20.809
Would you
please excuse us?

11:31.704 --> 11:33.572
How exactly did you manage
to get your head

11:33.656 --> 11:35.958
so far up your own ass?

11:36.025 --> 11:38.460
You told me
to take this deal.

11:38.528 --> 11:40.279
I did,
and now here I am.

11:40.363 --> 11:42.564
I didn't know
about these murders.

11:42.615 --> 11:44.950
What you don't seem to believe
is neither did I.

11:45.034 --> 11:46.434
We were doing our job.

11:46.486 --> 11:49.872
Cameron Dennis
will come at you with worse.

11:49.939 --> 11:51.290
Do you think
I did this?

11:51.374 --> 11:53.125
That's irrelevant.

11:53.209 --> 11:56.712
I just want to make sure I know
all the evidence against you.

11:56.779 --> 11:58.330
I have no idea
what the evidence is,

11:58.414 --> 11:59.965
because I had
nothing to do with it,

12:00.049 --> 12:03.051
and you say it's irrelevant,
but it's not irrelevant to me.

12:03.119 --> 12:05.520
Do you think I did this?

12:05.588 --> 12:06.638
Do you want a lawyer

12:06.723 --> 12:08.123
who thinks
you're innocent and loses

12:08.124 --> 12:10.676
or a lawyer who doesn't
want to know and wins?

12:10.760 --> 12:12.394
You know
the answer to that.

12:12.461 --> 12:14.146
Then don't ask me
that question again,

12:14.230 --> 12:15.964
'cause after I win
and you're free,

12:16.015 --> 12:18.967
what I think won't matter.

12:23.106 --> 12:25.190
So what did she want
to talk to you about?

12:25.275 --> 12:26.942
She wanted to know
if you were single.

12:26.993 --> 12:28.360
Listen, when you
get back to the office--

12:28.444 --> 12:29.661
Wait, what do you mean?

12:29.746 --> 12:31.029
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

12:31.114 --> 12:33.782
I mean, I thought we were
gonna go back together.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.417
I don't know, I thought we could
get some lunch or something.

12:35.484 --> 12:36.651
Like what?

12:36.703 --> 12:39.087
I don't know.
Like, maybe steak or something.

12:39.155 --> 12:40.505
It's the middle of the day.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.958
Yeah, Harvey, that's when
people usually eat lunch.

12:43.009 --> 12:45.210
This is about Louis,
isn't it?

12:45.295 --> 12:47.179
What? No.
Maybe.

12:47.263 --> 12:48.824
So I'm supposed to
take you mudding now?

12:48.831 --> 12:50.549
That's not the point.

12:50.633 --> 12:52.634
Look, let's just concentrate
on winning this thing,

12:52.685 --> 12:53.885
and when it's over,
we can talk

12:53.886 --> 12:55.771
about lunch, dinner,
or anything else.

12:55.838 --> 12:56.772
Whoa, whoa,
you really mean that?

12:56.839 --> 12:58.307
No.

12:58.358 --> 13:00.642
Butch and Sundance are back.

13:24.867 --> 13:25.968
What are you doing?

13:26.035 --> 13:27.586
Dropping off
something for Harvey.

13:27.670 --> 13:29.921
You don't have
any cases with Harvey.

13:30.006 --> 13:31.706
I will when he sees
what's in here.

13:31.758 --> 13:32.975
No.

13:33.042 --> 13:35.043
You're not taking credit
for my ideas again.

13:35.094 --> 13:36.678
Harvey's gonna know
I built this airplane.

13:36.729 --> 13:38.513
Harvey's not gonna
know anything.

13:38.564 --> 13:39.982
You're a little late
to the party.

13:40.049 --> 13:41.316
He and I
are working together again.

13:41.384 --> 13:43.402
I'm not looking
to take your place.

13:43.486 --> 13:44.820
Oh, really?

13:44.887 --> 13:46.438
You just happened to prepare
a document for him,

13:46.522 --> 13:48.106
thinking he didn't
have an associate?

13:48.191 --> 13:49.908
He's working a case
that I'm right for.

13:49.993 --> 13:52.227
That's not how it works
around here.

13:52.278 --> 13:53.862
I handle all of his cases.

13:53.913 --> 13:55.280
Does Harvey know that?

13:55.365 --> 13:58.233
What Harvey knows
is that I'm the "A" team,

13:58.284 --> 14:00.402
and you're the "B" team,
so you can leave the folder,

14:00.453 --> 14:01.920
or you can take it
with you,

14:02.005 --> 14:03.255
but if you're looking to ride
some partner's coattails,

14:03.339 --> 14:05.624
you're gonna have
to look somewhere else.

14:05.708 --> 14:08.844
Well, the "B" team
worked at the D.A.'s office

14:08.911 --> 14:10.345
and came up
with a defense strategy

14:10.413 --> 14:13.515
based on a specific knowledge
of Cameron Dennis.

14:13.582 --> 14:15.634
The "A" team
quotes him movies.

14:15.718 --> 14:18.186
We'll see who Harvey does
and doesn't value.

14:18.254 --> 14:21.473
Katrina,
Mike is Harvey's guy.

14:21.557 --> 14:23.558
When he tells you
he's speaking for Harvey,

14:23.609 --> 14:25.060
he's speaking for Harvey.

14:25.111 --> 14:26.144
And please don't
come into this office

14:26.229 --> 14:30.399
when I'm away
from my desk again.

14:36.456 --> 14:38.940
Boy, am I glad I never
snuck into Harvey's office

14:38.991 --> 14:42.627
when you
weren't around before.

14:42.712 --> 14:43.995
Thanks, Donna.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.630
I still expect
free, exotic,

14:45.715 --> 14:49.718
caffeinated beverages
for the foreseeable future.

14:53.336 --> 14:55.109
Cameron Dennis.
Son of a bitch.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.277
He played us.

14:56.328 --> 14:57.862
He slid that guilty plea
right by.

14:57.947 --> 15:00.148
I should've seen it coming.
We should've seen it coming.

15:00.165 --> 15:02.450
I'm the one that convinced you
to take that deal.

15:02.501 --> 15:03.835
What's done is done.

15:03.919 --> 15:05.670
Question is,
what's being done?

15:05.754 --> 15:08.039
I'm working on getting Ava
off these charges,

15:08.123 --> 15:10.675
and I got Mike working
on getting her out on bail.

15:10.759 --> 15:12.210
So you're back with him.

15:12.294 --> 15:13.995
What's the point
of having a right arm

15:14.046 --> 15:15.430
without a right hand?

15:15.497 --> 15:17.432
- Good.
- Is it?

15:17.499 --> 15:19.384
- What do you mean?
- I mean, he threatened you.

15:19.468 --> 15:20.602
I've never known you
to be forgiving

15:20.669 --> 15:22.103
with someone
who threatened you.

15:22.170 --> 15:24.939
I've never known you to be
particularly forgiving either.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.647
Um, I'm sorry,
I'll come back.

15:32.698 --> 15:33.982
It's okay.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.700
We're all good.

15:35.784 --> 15:38.036
We're good?

15:38.120 --> 15:39.737
When you work with tigers,

15:39.822 --> 15:43.074
once in a while, they're gonna
take a swipe at you.

15:43.158 --> 15:44.709
I like working with tigers.

15:44.793 --> 15:48.463
Of course, when they get out of
hand, you have to put them down.

15:48.530 --> 15:53.034
Now, where are we on the prep
for Ava's bail hearing?

15:53.085 --> 15:54.469
Well, I was thinking,

15:54.536 --> 15:58.039
since Cameron used the
settlement to double-cross us,

15:58.107 --> 16:01.142
why don't we use the bail
hearing to double-cross him?

16:03.312 --> 16:04.345
Your Honor,
this is not

16:04.396 --> 16:06.147
a Ponzi scheme
or insider trading,

16:06.214 --> 16:07.682
this is cold-blooded murder.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.100
Prosecution moves
that bail be denied.

16:09.184 --> 16:11.736
That's ridiculous.
My client's not going anywhere.

16:11.820 --> 16:12.987
She's got a business to run.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.188
Let's look
at how she does business.

16:14.239 --> 16:17.358
Less than 48 hours ago,
she admitted to bribery.

16:17.409 --> 16:19.243
You want to talk
about how she does business?

16:19.328 --> 16:21.162
Let's talk
about how you do business.

16:21.229 --> 16:23.498
Your Honor,
I have a list of 87 murder cases

16:23.565 --> 16:25.333
that Cameron Dennis
tried as a D.A.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.752
In each instance, he allowed
reasonable bail to be set.

16:27.836 --> 16:30.237
I allowed bail
because gangbangers

16:30.289 --> 16:33.041
don't have a fraction
of Ms. Hessington's resources.

16:33.092 --> 16:35.426
You allowed bail
because you didn't give a damn

16:35.511 --> 16:37.962
about those guys,
and this is personal.

16:38.047 --> 16:40.932
It's why you took the case,
it's why you hid a witness,

16:41.016 --> 16:44.185
and it's why you negotiated
a settlement in bad faith.

16:44.252 --> 16:47.105
My chambers now.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.442
You bring an accusation
like that into my courtroom,

16:51.527 --> 16:52.644
you better be able
to back it up.

16:52.728 --> 16:54.362
Your Honor,
when I told him

16:54.429 --> 16:55.829
he took this case
to stick it to me,

16:55.864 --> 16:57.899
he said, quote, "I did,

16:57.950 --> 17:00.234
and now I got her,
and you didn't see it coming."

17:00.285 --> 17:01.402
You know what, Your Honor?

17:01.453 --> 17:02.603
He's right.
I am sticking it to him.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.454
Guilty as charged,
just like his client.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.656
- Okay, let me--
- That's enough.

17:05.741 --> 17:07.325
I am not a washing machine.

17:07.409 --> 17:10.627
You two are not here
to air your dirty laundry.

17:10.713 --> 17:12.714
She admitted to bribing
a Colonel in the army,

17:12.781 --> 17:14.582
and that same army
killed these people.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.468
Three environmentalists
died in the polar ice cap.

17:17.553 --> 17:19.834
You think she killed them also?
Maybe I'll look into that.

17:19.887 --> 17:21.673
You gonna leak it
to a corporate raider too?

17:21.757 --> 17:23.007
What's he talking about?

17:23.092 --> 17:24.290
I'm talking about the fact
that he leaked

17:24.343 --> 17:26.144
this whole thing
to Tony Gianopolous.

17:26.228 --> 17:27.729
This is a personal vendetta,

17:27.796 --> 17:31.065
and he has no concrete evidence
against my client.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.967
Not only do I want no bail,

17:33.018 --> 17:35.019
I want you to throw
this case out right now.

17:35.104 --> 17:36.738
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.273
But I'll tell you something,
Mr. Dennis,

17:39.324 --> 17:41.943
I am setting bail at $1.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.078
And if you don't
have any evidence,

17:44.146 --> 17:46.447
I'm gonna hear his motion
for summary judgment,

17:46.498 --> 17:47.949
rule in his favor,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.985
and this trial is going to be
over before it even starts.

18:25.404 --> 18:28.039
Bloody hell.

18:31.526 --> 18:35.362
Um, excuse me, do you not
see me sitting here?

18:35.414 --> 18:38.633
Yeah, I saw you.
I just chose to ignore you.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.134
You must like
living dangerously.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.253
I do, and that's
why stopping here,

18:42.337 --> 18:45.223
doing this with you,
well, that's playing with fire.

18:45.307 --> 18:46.758
There's nothing wrong with
a little casual conversation.

18:46.842 --> 18:48.709
What happens
when casual conversation

18:48.761 --> 18:50.094
becomes serious fun?

18:50.179 --> 18:52.096
Oh, you're good.

18:52.181 --> 18:55.983
I can promise you,
I'm better than good.

18:56.051 --> 18:59.070
Stephen Huntley,
senior partner, London office.

18:59.154 --> 19:00.071
Donna.

19:00.155 --> 19:01.906
Just Donna?

19:01.990 --> 19:03.991
Yeah, it's like a name
and a title in one.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.243
You'll see.

19:05.327 --> 19:06.894
I've heard.

19:06.945 --> 19:08.496
Secretarial pool's
been buzzing

19:08.563 --> 19:10.414
about some new, feisty ginger
for a fortnight.

19:10.499 --> 19:11.783
Look, if you're trying
to charm your way

19:11.867 --> 19:13.251
into Harvey's office,
it's not gonna happen.

19:13.335 --> 19:14.669
Mm, no, I'm not trying
to charm my way

19:14.736 --> 19:15.837
into Harvey's office.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.371
Oh, what were you
trying for?

19:17.422 --> 19:19.173
Well, actually,
I was gonna try for--

19:19.241 --> 19:20.341
Donna, I need you
to send Louis

19:20.408 --> 19:22.043
everything we have
on Tony Gianopolous.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.127
He's running point.

19:23.212 --> 19:24.545
Harvey, a pleasure.
I'm Stephen.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.848
I know who you are,
and I know why you're here.

19:26.915 --> 19:30.268
You're Darby's fixer, and you're
here to hijack my case.

19:33.272 --> 19:34.388
Did you text him
whilst we were--

19:34.439 --> 19:37.108
You said you're good?

19:37.192 --> 19:38.442
I'm good too.

19:38.527 --> 19:41.062
This isn't over.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.897
Is that a threat?

19:42.948 --> 19:43.931
Mm, you take it
in whatever tone

19:43.982 --> 19:46.934
pleases you the most.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.907
You're right.

19:52.958 --> 19:56.327
I am Darby's fixer, but I'm not
here to hijack anything.

19:56.411 --> 19:57.745
When I got on a plane
at Heathrow,

19:57.796 --> 20:00.047
this was still
merely bribery.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.582
I've only just learned
of the murder charges now

20:01.633 --> 20:02.884
as I touched down.

20:02.951 --> 20:06.787
It just means the timing
changed, not the motive.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.640
Forget the bombshell
the prosecution's just dropped.

20:09.725 --> 20:13.895
Let's talk about the bombshell
outside your office.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.013
Donna?

20:16.098 --> 20:17.464
She's got a body
like Elizabeth Hurley

20:17.516 --> 20:19.016
and the sass
of Maggie Thatcher.

20:19.101 --> 20:21.269
I went out with Liz.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.688
Don't sell her short
in the sass department.

20:23.772 --> 20:26.107
Oh, I'm well aware
of her sass.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.108
'99.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.242
'98.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.144
Really?

20:30.195 --> 20:31.996
Well, you're obviously
a better man than I am.

20:31.997 --> 20:34.815
Don't beat yourself up.
You got plenty of company.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.151
By the way,
before you say anything else,

20:37.202 --> 20:40.371
she can hear
every word we say.

20:40.455 --> 20:42.757
Now, I've got
a murder charge to defend,

20:42.824 --> 20:45.126
so why don't you tell me
why the hell you're really here?

20:45.177 --> 20:48.212
Well, I'm here to oversee
cultural integration.

20:48.297 --> 20:49.931
Cultural integration.

20:49.998 --> 20:52.433
Standard part of the merger,
been on the books for two weeks.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.517
And why do you need me?

20:53.602 --> 20:55.102
Well, smoothing over

20:55.170 --> 20:57.305
these transitional periods
is never easy.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.523
It's not child's play.

20:59.608 --> 21:02.360
You're an influencer here.
People listen to you.

21:02.444 --> 21:04.528
I want you to help them
listen to me.

21:04.613 --> 21:06.030
I get it.

21:06.114 --> 21:08.149
You want me
to pave the way for you.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.533
Here's the thing.

21:09.618 --> 21:11.986
I don't pave the way
for people.

21:12.037 --> 21:14.155
People pave the way for me.

21:15.490 --> 21:17.408
Mm.

21:17.492 --> 21:19.210
I get it.

21:19.294 --> 21:22.046
Steer clear of you,
and you and I

21:22.130 --> 21:25.499
will get along
just fine.

21:25.550 --> 21:29.136
Welcome to New York.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.064
So, have you met
Stephen Huntley yet.

21:38.148 --> 21:39.898
- I did.
- What'd you think?

21:39.949 --> 21:41.510
Turns out we have
some things in common.

21:41.568 --> 21:45.771
Turns out he didn't
show up empty-handed.

21:45.822 --> 21:47.039
That's $1/2 million.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.624
Mmhmm, first dividend check
of the merger.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.908
That was my buy-in amount.

21:49.959 --> 21:52.461
Maybe it wasn't
such a bad idea after all.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.130
Wait a second.
What was your check for?

21:55.215 --> 21:56.415
More than that.

21:56.466 --> 21:57.499
1.2?

21:57.584 --> 21:59.001
I'm not telling.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.887
1.5?

22:01.954 --> 22:03.756
You're three times
more valuable than me?

22:03.807 --> 22:06.308
Oh, I don't think that.
The check thinks that.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.559
Does the check think
the only thing

22:07.627 --> 22:09.645
that guy's here for
is cultural integration?

22:09.729 --> 22:11.930
The check
wasn't born yesterday.

22:11.981 --> 22:13.399
He is to Darby
what you are to me,

22:13.466 --> 22:14.933
and I wouldn't send you
to do that.

22:14.984 --> 22:15.984
No, you wouldn't.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.352
So what'd you tell him?

22:17.437 --> 22:19.822
I told him as long
as he steers clear of me,

22:19.906 --> 22:20.823
he'll be fine.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.191
You told him wrong.

22:22.275 --> 22:26.528
I want you to find out
what the hell that guy's up to.

22:28.248 --> 22:30.332
She's right, you know.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.334
Cultural integration's
scheduled for a week.

22:32.419 --> 22:35.754
Stephen Huntley booked a room
at the Peninsula for a month.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.623
Is it a room or a suite?
It's important.

22:37.674 --> 22:39.792
- A suite.
- Good work.

22:39.843 --> 22:42.127
- It's what I do.
- There's only one problem.

22:42.178 --> 22:46.548
Jessica just told me
to look into him one second ago.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.717
- I anticipated her needs.
- No, you didn't.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.969
I anticipated your needs?

22:51.020 --> 22:53.639
You anticipated your needs.
And by "your needs," I mean--

22:53.690 --> 22:56.475
Okay, my needs are not
the topic of this conversation.

22:56.526 --> 22:57.943
All I'm saying is,
you went to the trouble

22:58.010 --> 23:01.029
of specifically finding out
he booked a suite.

23:01.114 --> 23:04.032
- W--
- Save it.

23:13.543 --> 23:15.327
Can I talk to you
for a second?

23:15.378 --> 23:19.698
Not if it's about working
with Harvey on this case.

23:19.749 --> 23:23.719
Look, this isn't easy for me
to do, but for some reason,

23:23.803 --> 23:27.306
you and I keep locking horns,
and now I'm out in the cold.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.925
I know how I got here, but
I don't know how to get back.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.510
What do you want, Katrina?

23:31.561 --> 23:34.480
I want to figure out a way
we can coexist in this firm.

23:34.547 --> 23:35.714
You want to know a way?

23:35.765 --> 23:37.883
When you see me coming,
give me a wide berth.

23:37.934 --> 23:40.068
You know what?
I'm apologizing to you.

23:40.153 --> 23:41.904
You don't have to be a dick.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.405
I'm a dick?

23:43.490 --> 23:45.223
You have treated
everyone at this firm

23:45.275 --> 23:47.442
below your station
like shit.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.611
Now all of a sudden
you want to be my best friend?

23:49.696 --> 23:51.446
Oh, I get it.

23:51.531 --> 23:52.898
This isn't about me and you.

23:52.949 --> 23:55.751
This is about me
and your little girlfriend.

23:55.835 --> 23:58.287
Rachel
is not my girlfriend.

23:58.371 --> 24:02.174
This has nothing to do with her,
and this conversation is over.

24:02.241 --> 24:07.179
Funny how you know exactly
who I was talking about.

24:16.255 --> 24:20.425
Thank you.

24:20.476 --> 24:23.362
Harvey, to what do I owe
the pleasure of this lunch?

24:23.429 --> 24:25.314
I wanted to thank you
for the check.

24:25.398 --> 24:27.733
Oh, I thought
that'd change your attitude.

24:27.784 --> 24:28.784
It did.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.619
In fact,
you gave something to me,

24:30.703 --> 24:32.154
I want to give
something to you.

24:32.238 --> 24:35.106
What is it?

24:35.158 --> 24:36.208
It's a hotel bill.

24:36.275 --> 24:39.461
I paid it.
Then I checked you out.

24:39.546 --> 24:42.781
Hope you left housekeeping
a hefty gratuity.

24:42.832 --> 24:43.999
You're not here
to deliver checks

24:44.083 --> 24:45.968
or make
smooth transitions,

24:46.052 --> 24:47.719
and if you're not
gonna tell me the truth,

24:47.787 --> 24:49.221
you don't need
to be here at all.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.422
Well, that's gonna make it

24:50.473 --> 24:53.809
extremely difficult
for me to help you

24:53.893 --> 24:56.812
take over the firm
from Jessica.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.964
I know about your deal
with Edward.

24:59.015 --> 25:00.098
He sent me here to help.

25:00.149 --> 25:01.817
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

25:01.901 --> 25:03.235
Well, you told me
Miss Moneypenny was listening.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.153
I didn't know
whether you wanted her to hear.

25:05.238 --> 25:09.608
So you're here to help me
take over the firm from Jessica?

25:09.659 --> 25:12.578
What exactly does that mean?
You know what it means.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.780
I don't need you
baby-sitting me on this case.

25:14.831 --> 25:15.948
I'm not a baby-sitter.

25:15.999 --> 25:18.917
I'm a fixer.
I'm here to help you.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.118
Now why would you
turn that down?

25:20.169 --> 25:22.004
What's to stop you
from using this

25:22.088 --> 25:23.455
to take over
the firm from me?

25:23.506 --> 25:24.790
I'm not like you.

25:24.841 --> 25:27.342
I don't care to have
my name on the door.

25:27.427 --> 25:29.678
So you're here
just to help me.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.430
You don't need
anything in return.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.599
Your car club has a pair

25:33.666 --> 25:36.802
of mint 1956
Porsche speedsters.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.370
You want to drive one?

25:38.438 --> 25:40.138
I want to race you.

25:40.189 --> 25:43.008
Harvey,
fancy meeting you here.

25:43.059 --> 25:44.226
Cameron,
you keep showing up unannounced,

25:44.310 --> 25:46.228
and I'm not sure why.

25:46.312 --> 25:47.729
I can meet you
anytime, anywhere,

25:47.814 --> 25:49.314
because I'm not afraid
of you.

25:49.365 --> 25:51.149
Well, you should be.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.484
I've got five witnesses

25:52.535 --> 25:54.536
who place the Colonel
that your client bribed

25:54.621 --> 25:55.570
at the scene
of those murders.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.990
You want evidence?
Here it is.

25:58.041 --> 25:59.658
See you in court.

25:59.709 --> 26:03.662
We can schedule it
for anytime, anywhere.

26:06.549 --> 26:08.834
You still
don't want my help?

26:08.885 --> 26:12.004
No, I don't.

26:12.055 --> 26:13.088
I don't trust you.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.473
I'm not telling you
to trust me.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.425
I'm telling you
that this is what Darby wants.

26:16.509 --> 26:17.676
Well, Darby isn't here.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.768
Hey, you wanted to talk to me?

26:26.853 --> 26:28.987
Hey, yes.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.356
So I know you don't want me
fighting your battles for you,

26:31.407 --> 26:33.358
and I didn't.
Uhoh.

26:33.409 --> 26:35.827
I just don't want you
to get upset with me.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.412
What?

26:37.497 --> 26:38.780
I went to talk to Donna

26:38.865 --> 26:43.285
about her and me,
and you came up.

26:43.369 --> 26:45.253
What about me?

26:45.338 --> 26:49.958
That it's time for you
to be accepted back.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.794
- That's why she did it.
- Did what?

26:52.879 --> 26:54.713
I caught Katrina
trying to horn in on my case.

26:54.764 --> 26:56.214
- Again?
- Yeah, I know.

26:56.265 --> 26:57.425
Donna walked in
in the middle,

26:57.433 --> 27:00.385
and she took her
to the woodshed.

27:00.436 --> 27:02.054
So you're okay
with what I did?

27:02.105 --> 27:03.772
I'm more than okay.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.308
Not only did Katrina
slink away,

27:06.392 --> 27:07.893
but she came back later
with her tail between her legs,

27:07.944 --> 27:09.644
looking to be my friend.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.763
Well, she is not your friend.

27:11.814 --> 27:13.431
She's definitely not
my friend.

27:13.483 --> 27:16.318
She most certainly isn't.

27:16.402 --> 27:17.819
What are you talking about?

27:17.904 --> 27:19.488
Um...

27:19.572 --> 27:21.907
After I told her that she
could take her friendship

27:21.958 --> 27:23.441
and shove it up her ass,

27:23.493 --> 27:26.795
she said that this whole thing
was about you

27:26.879 --> 27:31.299
and that I was just trying
to protect my girlfriend.

27:31.384 --> 27:32.801
She called me
your girl--girlfriend?

27:32.885 --> 27:33.802
Mmhmm.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.087
And what did you say?

27:35.138 --> 27:37.622
I mean, what--
what could I say?

27:37.673 --> 27:40.759
We're keeping it a secret.
I-I said you weren't.

27:40.810 --> 27:43.729
Good.

27:43.796 --> 27:46.598
Yeah.

27:49.485 --> 27:51.737
Am I?

27:51.804 --> 27:53.355
Don't you know?

27:53.439 --> 27:55.190
Well, we never really
talked about it.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.358
You mean,
I've never really asked.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.360
Nobody asks
anybody anymore.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.251
Whoops.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.254
Sorry.
Are you okay?

28:10.673 --> 28:14.793
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,
will you be my girlfriend?

28:18.131 --> 28:20.265
Yes.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.058
What the hell is this?

28:30.143 --> 28:31.777
What?

28:31.844 --> 28:33.945
I'm working with Harvey,
my best friend.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.947
Harvey gave birth to me.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.199
When you see me coming,

28:37.283 --> 28:39.534
give me a wide berth,
because I'm a dick.

28:39.619 --> 28:41.203
I'm a dick, dick, dick.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.121
I'm working with Harvey,

28:43.189 --> 28:44.990
my best friend...
Oh, my God.

28:51.047 --> 28:53.298
You're not the fool anymore,
Louis.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.000
Mike Ross is.

28:55.051 --> 28:57.469
And I can't take it back.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.204
I put myself
out on a limb for you,

28:59.255 --> 29:03.975
so if you say no to me,
I won't just be a fool.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.978
I'll be done.

29:13.319 --> 29:14.853
Ugh, this means war.

29:14.904 --> 29:16.354
And I am not taking
any prisoners.

29:16.405 --> 29:18.440
If you think I'm staying
out of it, you're crazy.

29:18.524 --> 29:19.658
I don't want you out of it.
I want you in it.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.526
So what are we gonna do?

29:21.577 --> 29:22.527
Nothing right now.

29:22.578 --> 29:25.831
I need to help Harvey.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.453
I don't believe it.

29:31.537 --> 29:34.122
It's a setback,
but it's going away.

29:34.207 --> 29:37.175
And what exactly
does that mean?

29:38.511 --> 29:40.629
I looked into three
of the witnesses,

29:40.713 --> 29:43.465
and all three were affiliated
with a guerilla faction

29:43.549 --> 29:45.350
within the last five years.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.857
We're gonna paint
the entire incident

29:46.919 --> 29:49.855
as a firefight between
the government and armed rebels.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.223
Which, as you pointed out,

29:51.274 --> 29:52.858
is exactly how it was reported
in the first place.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.143
They're still placing
the Colonel at these murders.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.349
I don't think
you understand.

29:56.362 --> 29:57.445
This is what I found
in two hours.

29:57.530 --> 30:00.198
In another day--
I understand perfectly.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.317
You want to tear
these people down in court.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.619
Well, I'm suggesting
they never get there.

30:04.704 --> 30:08.073
We find out how to get to them,
and we pay them off.

30:08.124 --> 30:09.708
Bribery is what got you
into this situation.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.459
Now you think
that's your way out?

30:11.544 --> 30:13.628
That's what you said
when I suggested that with Nick,

30:13.713 --> 30:15.046
and I listened to you.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.748
And I was able to
neutralize him without a payoff.

30:16.799 --> 30:18.160
You were able
to get Cameron Dennis

30:18.217 --> 30:21.419
to offer me a deal that's
now being used against me.

30:21.470 --> 30:24.005
And even if you can
impugn these five witnesses,

30:24.090 --> 30:26.057
your way still
goes to a verdict.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.309
Mine doesn't.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.760
It doesn't
if we don't get caught.

30:28.811 --> 30:29.844
Then don't get caught.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.813
We're not
going to get caught,

30:31.898 --> 30:33.481
because we're not doing this.

30:33.566 --> 30:36.985
You told me you'd do
anything it takes to win.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.653
Remember that?

30:38.738 --> 30:40.418
You'll steal
the rival pitcher's girlfriend

30:40.472 --> 30:41.773
the night
before the big game.

30:41.824 --> 30:43.992
This is the night
before the big game.

30:44.076 --> 30:46.578
Ms. Hessington, what
you're proposing is a crime.

30:46.645 --> 30:50.999
A crime to get me
out of a crime I didn't commit.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.287
You said it doesn't matter
whether you believe me or not.

30:55.338 --> 30:56.788
It doesn't.

30:56.839 --> 30:58.256
But it does,

30:58.324 --> 31:00.592
because if you thought
I was innocent, you'd do this.

31:00.659 --> 31:03.094
I won't.

31:05.664 --> 31:06.881
Then you're fired.

31:06.966 --> 31:10.552
And I'll find
someone who will.

31:15.599 --> 31:16.747
Where did you get
this picture?

31:16.748 --> 31:20.172
- I friended her on Facebook.
- She accepted?

31:20.173 --> 31:21.256
Not as me.

31:21.341 --> 31:23.008
I found an intern
at the D.A.'s office

31:23.059 --> 31:24.176
that she worked with
two years ago

31:24.227 --> 31:25.627
who doesn't have
a Facebook account.

31:25.678 --> 31:27.229
Mm. See?

31:27.313 --> 31:29.564
You're not the only one
who can away with fraud.

31:29.649 --> 31:33.051
Okay, step aside.

31:33.102 --> 31:35.270
Aha.

31:35.355 --> 31:36.571
Holy shit.

31:36.656 --> 31:38.556
Yeah, you do not want
to get on my bad side.

31:38.608 --> 31:39.608
I can see that.

31:39.692 --> 31:41.360
What are you working on?

31:41.411 --> 31:43.328
Oh, let me rephrase.

31:43.396 --> 31:46.665
Why the hell aren't you
working on Ava's defense?

31:49.585 --> 31:50.869
Uh, because we got fired.

31:50.920 --> 31:52.671
That's no reason
not to work on her defense.

31:52.738 --> 31:54.122
Look, Harvey,

31:54.207 --> 31:55.841
I know we're just getting back
on the same team and all,

31:55.908 --> 31:57.009
and I don't want
to disagree with you,

31:57.076 --> 31:58.716
but it's actually
a very excellent reason.

31:58.761 --> 32:00.012
Wrong.

32:00.079 --> 32:02.247
Odds are Cameron's
expecting her to do this,

32:02.298 --> 32:03.415
and we get a call tomorrow

32:03.466 --> 32:04.716
to get her
out of a new bribery charge.

32:04.767 --> 32:06.751
And then whatever lawyer
she replaces us with

32:06.803 --> 32:08.470
can't stand up
to Cameron in court.

32:08.554 --> 32:09.972
'Cause he's not gonna
stop working on this.

32:10.056 --> 32:11.440
And neither are we.

32:11.524 --> 32:12.941
One more thing.

32:13.026 --> 32:14.726
Don't.
Don't what?

32:14.777 --> 32:15.944
You think I don't know

32:16.029 --> 32:17.696
what you were doing
in there with Rachel?

32:17.763 --> 32:19.781
You saw it too?

32:19.866 --> 32:22.034
I did,
and I need you to let it go.

32:22.101 --> 32:24.403
Wait, so you're saying
she threw a punch,

32:24.454 --> 32:26.038
and you don't want me
to throw a punch back?

32:26.105 --> 32:28.407
I'm saying we're
in the middle of a murder trial,

32:28.458 --> 32:31.609
and I need you
to let it go.

32:35.415 --> 32:38.950
Harvey, is there something
you'd like to tell me about Ava?

32:39.002 --> 32:41.253
Yeah, some clients can be
a pain in the ass.

32:41.304 --> 32:42.921
Some ex-clients too.

32:42.972 --> 32:44.756
- Temporary situation.
- Good, good.

32:44.807 --> 32:46.725
'Cause I just wanted to make
sure you were still all over it.

32:46.792 --> 32:48.343
Did you want to make sure
the sun was still shining

32:48.428 --> 32:50.262
and the sky
was still blue?

32:50.313 --> 32:53.298
I'd be humble
after I got fired.

32:53.349 --> 32:55.767
If I ever got fired.

33:00.306 --> 33:03.025
I don't know what it's like
in the D.A.'s office now,

33:03.109 --> 33:04.192
but if I did
what you did

33:04.277 --> 33:06.611
to someone who was with me
in the trenches,

33:06.662 --> 33:08.663
I'd be done,
like you are now.

33:08.748 --> 33:11.917
You have no idea what the
story is between me and Mike.

33:11.984 --> 33:13.201
I don't care
what the story is.

33:13.286 --> 33:15.987
You hired me,
and then you hung me out to dry.

33:16.039 --> 33:18.090
You don't give me cases.
You don't give me a word.

33:18.157 --> 33:19.291
What am I supposed to do?

33:19.342 --> 33:21.159
We both know
how you got here.

33:21.210 --> 33:24.296
You expect more from me?
That's not my problem.

33:24.347 --> 33:25.630
I do know how I got here,

33:25.681 --> 33:28.833
which is how I know
you're not gonna fire me.

33:28.885 --> 33:30.852
So keep your empty threats
to yourself.

33:30.937 --> 33:33.055
When I said, "you're done,"

33:33.139 --> 33:35.507
I meant your future
at this firm is over,

33:35.558 --> 33:37.025
because you will
never be anything

33:37.110 --> 33:39.611
more than you are
right now.

33:39.678 --> 33:43.482
And if you ever do
anything like that

33:43.533 --> 33:45.283
to Mike Ross again,

33:45.351 --> 33:47.235
I don't give a shit
what our deal was.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.238
You'll be gone.

33:57.046 --> 33:58.363
Hey.

33:58.414 --> 34:00.499
Remember that thing
we were gonna do to Katrina?

34:00.550 --> 34:01.883
We don't need
to do it anymore.

34:01.968 --> 34:03.968
- What are you talking about?
- Harvey just did it.

34:03.970 --> 34:05.587
He went to talk to her?

34:05.671 --> 34:07.806
He laid her out.

34:07.873 --> 34:12.393
Yeah, you don't want to be
on his bad side either.

34:12.478 --> 34:13.562
You know, we could still
send her that thing.

34:13.646 --> 34:14.679
Really?

34:14.730 --> 34:16.348
No, actually,
Harvey told me not to.

34:16.399 --> 34:17.565
So?
He's not so tough.

34:17.650 --> 34:18.600
Yeah,
but we could take him.

34:18.684 --> 34:19.650
What's he gonna do?

34:19.717 --> 34:22.187
Talk to us with his words?

34:22.237 --> 34:23.321
Wag a finger at us.

34:23.389 --> 34:24.489
Maybe give us a time-out.

34:24.556 --> 34:26.658
Maybe even slap us
with a lawsuit.

34:30.580 --> 34:33.031
High five.

34:33.081 --> 34:35.333
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:37.402 --> 34:38.842
We don't need to bribe
the witnesses.

34:38.871 --> 34:40.371
We need them to sue us,
right?

34:40.422 --> 34:42.623
The alien tort statute
allows foreign nationals

34:42.708 --> 34:44.208
to bring civil claims
in U.S. court.

34:44.260 --> 34:45.543
And then we settle.

34:45.594 --> 34:47.179
Might be a payoff,
but it's a legal payoff.

34:47.246 --> 34:48.913
And the witnesses
aren't Americans,

34:48.965 --> 34:50.181
so Cameron
can't subpoena them.

34:50.248 --> 34:51.416
Exactly.

34:51.467 --> 34:52.750
Good, but they need
a legitimate claim,

34:52.802 --> 34:54.853
or we could be on the hook
for bribery ourselves.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.054
What are they suing us for?

34:56.105 --> 34:57.666
Harvey, they witnessed
multiple murders.

34:57.723 --> 34:59.441
That would be
emotionally distressing.

34:59.525 --> 35:01.059
Might even
suffer from P.T.S.D.

35:01.110 --> 35:02.644
Which would prevent them
from getting on the plane

35:02.728 --> 35:04.112
and testifying
in our case.

35:04.197 --> 35:05.564
Get it going.

35:05.615 --> 35:07.399
You got a lawyer
to take the other side?

35:07.450 --> 35:08.766
I have someone in mind,

35:08.818 --> 35:10.569
but we need a way to get
those witnesses to go for it.

35:10.620 --> 35:12.937
No, right now our problem
isn't getting them to go for it.

35:12.989 --> 35:15.657
It's getting to Ava before she
gets someone to bribe them.

35:15.741 --> 35:17.042
Hey, Harvey.

35:17.109 --> 35:20.745
I heard about what you did
with Katrina.

35:20.796 --> 35:23.882
I know I asked you not to,
and I wasn't going to,

35:23.949 --> 35:26.001
but I saw her,
and I couldn't help it.

35:26.085 --> 35:27.052
I get it.

35:27.119 --> 35:28.453
She brings that out
in people,

35:28.504 --> 35:32.424
but listen,
just don't let it happen again.

35:34.677 --> 35:37.729
Son of a bitch.

36:04.685 --> 36:06.886
I'd call you
a lying son of a bitch,

36:06.937 --> 36:08.938
but you were
true to your word.

36:09.022 --> 36:11.274
- Yeah, what word's that?
- You're not like me.

36:11.358 --> 36:13.059
I didn't hijack
your client, Harvey.

36:13.110 --> 36:14.977
Oh, no, you waited
for her to fire me,

36:15.062 --> 36:17.063
and then you swooped in
with an illegal fix.

36:17.114 --> 36:18.281
You're wrong.

36:18.365 --> 36:19.815
You gonna look me in the eye
and tell me

36:19.900 --> 36:22.260
you didn't just meet with her
about bribing those witnesses?

36:22.269 --> 36:24.070
That's exactly
what I met with her about.

36:24.121 --> 36:26.122
She asked me if I was willing,
and I said I was.

36:26.206 --> 36:29.909
I also told her that
in this particular situation,

36:29.960 --> 36:32.578
it'd be counterproductive.

36:32.629 --> 36:34.330
You looked
into Cameron Dennis.

36:34.414 --> 36:37.083
She bribes those witnesses,
he'll be lying in wait.

36:37.134 --> 36:38.501
And that's what
you told her?

36:38.585 --> 36:39.919
Yeah, amongst other things.

36:39.970 --> 36:42.004
You told her
to stick with the lawyer

36:42.089 --> 36:43.306
she picked
in the first place?

36:43.390 --> 36:46.559
More or less.

36:46.626 --> 36:47.977
Harvey, listen,
I told you,

36:48.061 --> 36:50.179
you don't have
to trust me, okay?

36:50.264 --> 36:51.814
But Darby does.

36:51.899 --> 36:53.182
And Darby wants this win.

36:53.267 --> 36:54.850
Therefore, so do I.

36:54.935 --> 36:57.270
I'm guessing you think
that means that I owe you.

36:57.321 --> 37:00.573
No, I think it means
you're gonna pay me.

37:06.697 --> 37:08.147
You look happy.

37:08.198 --> 37:09.699
Dodged a bullet.

37:09.783 --> 37:11.083
You got Ava back.

37:11.151 --> 37:13.836
Stephen got Ava back.
Turns out he's here to help.

37:13.921 --> 37:15.454
And you believe that?

37:15.505 --> 37:17.707
He got Ava back.

37:17.791 --> 37:20.426
Mike's on his way over there
as we speak.

37:20.493 --> 37:21.427
Mike?

37:21.494 --> 37:22.545
He made the call.

37:22.629 --> 37:24.096
Why not let him
score the touchdown?

37:24.164 --> 37:26.716
And you must have
someplace else to be.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.100
Blonde or brunette?

37:28.168 --> 37:29.101
Neither.

37:29.169 --> 37:31.938
I have to go repay a debt.

37:33.807 --> 37:37.610
So once this is all
taken care of, I wire the money.

37:37.677 --> 37:42.148
And Cameron's witnesses
never take the stand.

37:42.199 --> 37:45.067
Harvey told me
this maneuver was your idea.

37:45.152 --> 37:48.988
I'm not one to take credit,
but, yes, it was.

37:49.039 --> 37:51.123
He trusts you,
doesn't he?

37:51.191 --> 37:52.524
I like to think so.

37:52.576 --> 37:54.543
So you know
how he thinks?

37:54.628 --> 37:56.045
What I know
about how Harvey thinks

37:56.129 --> 37:58.581
is that you can never be sure
what Harvey's gonna think.

37:58.665 --> 38:00.466
What do you think
he thinks?

38:00.534 --> 38:04.420
I think
that he's not really interested

38:04.504 --> 38:06.055
in whether
you did it or not.

38:06.139 --> 38:08.207
He's interested
in what the evidence is

38:08.258 --> 38:09.875
and what we can
make it say.

38:09.926 --> 38:11.143
I want to know.

38:11.211 --> 38:14.730
- Then you should ask him.
- I'm asking you.

38:18.068 --> 38:19.652
I have no idea
whether Harvey thinks

38:19.719 --> 38:22.822
you had those people
murdered or not,

38:22.889 --> 38:25.324
but even if I did,
I would never say anything

38:25.392 --> 38:28.911
because he wouldn't
want me to.

38:28.996 --> 38:30.363
He's picked
a good number two.

38:30.414 --> 38:33.115
I like to think so.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.167
What do you think?

38:39.122 --> 38:40.572
I think it's my job
to represent you

38:40.624 --> 38:42.758
to the best
of my ability.

38:42.843 --> 38:44.960
To say anything else would be
as big a betrayal to Harvey

38:45.045 --> 38:47.963
as discussing
what he thinks.

39:09.202 --> 39:11.454
Let me guess,
you won the Testosterone 500,

39:11.538 --> 39:12.655
and you're here to brag.

39:12.739 --> 39:15.274
Actually,
Harvey took the checkered flag,

39:15.325 --> 39:16.575
and I'm here for you.

39:16.626 --> 39:18.711
Why would I go out
with a loser?

39:18.778 --> 39:20.296
Well, losing
has its benefits.

39:20.380 --> 39:21.664
If he thinks
he's a better man than me,

39:21.748 --> 39:23.799
then he won't get jealous.

39:23.884 --> 39:25.524
Oh, Harvey's got
nothing to be jealous of.

39:25.552 --> 39:26.635
Not yet.

39:26.720 --> 39:30.756
He will be
if you take a ride with me.

39:30.807 --> 39:32.558
That could be dangerous.

39:32.625 --> 39:35.394
Yeah.

39:35.462 --> 39:36.462
Look,
if you think

39:36.513 --> 39:38.230
a fancy car
and some smooth talk

39:38.298 --> 39:40.099
is all it takes
to get to me...

39:43.653 --> 39:46.605
Okay, I understand.

39:46.656 --> 39:48.574
I'm sure I can find another
connoisseur of the theater

39:48.641 --> 39:49.658
to take to <i>MacBeth.</i>

39:49.743 --> 39:51.327
Oh, your research
came up short.

39:51.411 --> 39:52.611
I've already seen <i>MacBeth.</i>

39:52.662 --> 39:55.147
Not with me,
not in the front row,

39:55.198 --> 39:58.951
and certainly
not with Daniel Day-Lewis.

40:05.158 --> 40:06.342
I'm in trouble.

40:12.799 --> 40:15.184
This is everything
I have on Tony Gianopolous.

40:15.268 --> 40:19.472
Read it, summarize it,
and make it your life.

40:19.523 --> 40:20.890
I won't let you down.

40:20.974 --> 40:24.009
Welcome to team Litt.

40:25.178 --> 40:28.564
Louis.

40:28.648 --> 40:30.733
Thank you.

40:41.745 --> 40:44.296
Here it is.
Fully executed settlement.

40:44.364 --> 40:47.716
Signed, sealed, delivered.

40:47.801 --> 40:49.552
Who'd you get
to represent the other side?

40:49.636 --> 40:50.920
Harold Gunderson.

40:51.004 --> 40:53.222
Louis' whipping boy?

40:53.306 --> 40:55.207
Yeah, he works
for Allison Holt now,

40:55.258 --> 40:56.425
which is actually
kind of perfect,

40:56.510 --> 40:57.476
'cause everyone
knows she would

40:57.544 --> 40:58.761
never do anything
to help us.

40:58.845 --> 41:01.230
But I got Harold the job,
so--

41:01.314 --> 41:02.765
He owes you one.

41:02.849 --> 41:05.267
Not anymore.

41:06.987 --> 41:09.321
What'd you say?

41:09.389 --> 41:11.023
What?

41:11.074 --> 41:12.775
When Ava asked
if I thought she was guilty.

41:12.859 --> 41:15.277
I told her that I had no idea
what you thought

41:15.362 --> 41:19.248
and it was none of her business
what I thought.

41:21.901 --> 41:24.503
Good answer.

41:29.843 --> 41:32.211
What about you?

41:32.262 --> 41:33.546
You want to know
what I think?

41:33.597 --> 41:38.100
I know what you think,
and I think it too.

41:38.185 --> 41:40.419
She did it.

41:46.309 --> 41:50.196
We, uh...
We never had drinks before.

41:50.263 --> 41:52.281
I know.

41:52.365 --> 41:54.366
Harvey,
we just admitted to each other

41:54.434 --> 41:57.236
that we're defending
a murderer.

41:57.287 --> 41:59.622
Doesn't really seem like
cause for celebration.

41:59.706 --> 42:02.491
It's not a celebration.

42:02.576 --> 42:05.878
Remember when you said
Butch and Sundance were back?

42:05.945 --> 42:09.164
They weren't.

42:09.249 --> 42:10.966
What do you mean?

42:11.051 --> 42:13.219
I mean
it's time I told you

42:13.286 --> 42:16.755
I made a deal with Darby to
take over the firm from Jessica.
