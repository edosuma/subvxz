00:01.625 --> 00:02.750
[GAME WHEEL RATTLES]

00:02.750 --> 00:04.875
MMM, WHERE AM I?

00:07.708 --> 00:10.667
WHATCHA THINKING?

00:10.667 --> 00:13.166
UH, NOTHING.

00:13.166 --> 00:16.041
JUST...JOEY.

00:16.041 --> 00:21.291
UH, SHE AND JEN
GOT ON A TRAIN FOR NEW YORK
A COUPLE HOURS AGO.

00:21.291 --> 00:23.500
DON'T THEY HAVE
SCHOOL IN THE MORNING?

00:23.500 --> 00:26.667
NO. NO, THEY DON'T.
IT'S DITCH DAY.

00:26.667 --> 00:27.917
YOU KNOW, THE NIGHT
BEFORE OUR DITCH DAY,

00:27.917 --> 00:30.792
ME, ALICE, CAROL,
TED, AND BOBBY

00:30.792 --> 00:31.667
WERE SITTING
AT MY HOUSE,

00:31.667 --> 00:33.875
AND WE DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.792
SO WE GOT
IN OUR CAR

00:35.792 --> 00:37.959
AND WE JUST STARTED
TO DRIVE SOUTH.

00:37.959 --> 00:40.750
WE DROVE ALL NIGHT,
ALL DAY,

00:40.750 --> 00:42.667
ALL THE WAY TO THE
VIRGINIA STATE LINE,

00:42.667 --> 00:44.834
GOT OUT OF OUR CAR,
LOOKED AROUND,

00:44.834 --> 00:45.875
TURNED BACK,
AND DROVE HOME.

00:45.875 --> 00:47.959
I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
REMOTELY LIKE THAT

00:47.959 --> 00:49.625
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
WITH ANYONE.

00:49.625 --> 00:52.291
WHY NOT?

00:55.041 --> 00:56.959
WAIT,
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

00:56.959 --> 00:57.959
WHAT ABOUT LIFE?

00:57.959 --> 00:59.625
I WAS ABOUT
TO RETIRE IN STYLE.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.083
WE'RE GONNA ABANDON LIFE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.250
WE'RE GONNA GET IN
THE CAR AND DRIVE.

01:03.250 --> 01:06.875
WHOA, TEX. I WASN'T
MAKING A SUGGESTION,

01:06.875 --> 01:09.375
JUST BASKING IN
A NOSTALGIC IMPULSE.

01:09.375 --> 01:11.625
DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE NEED.

01:11.625 --> 01:14.166
WHY DOES THIS
SOUND LIKE A BRUCE
SPRINGSTEEN SONG?

01:14.166 --> 01:16.333
IT IS, EXACTLY LIKE THAT.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.375
IT'S EPIC
AND--AND ROMANTIC

01:18.375 --> 01:19.959
AND CRAZY AND PERFECT.

01:19.959 --> 01:21.875
PLUS, I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE A CHOICE

01:21.875 --> 01:22.792
'CAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH
JUST TO RECOGNIZE
YOUR FEARS.

01:22.792 --> 01:25.750
WELL, IT MAY BE ENOUGH
FOR RIGHT NOW.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.917
NO, IT'S--I CAN'T WAIT.

01:27.917 --> 01:29.834
TIME IS RUNNING OUT.
I MEAN, DON'T YOU FEEL IT,

01:29.834 --> 01:31.417
AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT,
THE ABSOLUTE URGENCY
OF THIS MOMENT?

01:32.750 --> 01:34.708
COME ON.

02:27.291 --> 02:28.917
Frost: YOU'RE
VERY QUIET TODAY.

02:28.917 --> 02:31.000
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.458
DON'T BE.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.500
TELL ME
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND.

02:36.041 --> 02:36.667
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

02:36.667 --> 02:39.000
WE'LL SEE.

02:40.041 --> 02:42.333
YOU KNOW THE SONG
SWEET JANE?

02:42.333 --> 02:46.458
SWEET JANE.
COWBOY JUNKIES?

02:46.458 --> 02:48.792
MMM, IT'S LOU REED,
ACTUALLY.

02:48.792 --> 02:53.041
UM, THE COWBOY JUNKIES
COVERED IT A FEW YEARS AGO,
BUT THAT'S THE ONE.

02:53.041 --> 02:55.333
IT'S STUCK IN MY HEAD.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.417
I USED TO REALLY
LOVE THAT SONG.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.125
LEARNED IT BY HEART.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.959
SO, DID I PERHAPS MENTION

03:06.959 --> 03:08.500
MY LIST AND
SCHEDULE OF DESTINATIONS

03:08.500 --> 03:09.542
I WILL BE VISITING
IN THIS CITY

03:09.542 --> 03:11.333
WHILE YOU ARE AT
YOUR BORING COLLEGE MEETING?

03:11.333 --> 03:12.417
SEVERAL TIMES.

03:12.417 --> 03:14.125
OK, SO I FIGURED OUT
PRECISELY WHEN AND WHERE

03:14.125 --> 03:16.125
WE NEED TO SPLIT UP
AND GET BACK TOGETHER
FOR DINNER AT 8:00

03:16.125 --> 03:18.041
IF WE GOTTA MAKE
THE TRAIN AT 11:00.

03:18.041 --> 03:20.000
YOU ARE FLIRTING
WITH MANIACAL,
SWEETIE.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.333
WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE IS

03:21.333 --> 03:22.375
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF NEW YORK?

03:22.375 --> 03:24.458
YEAH, I'M SURE
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

03:24.458 --> 03:25.583
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK
WE BETTER GET
HEADING DOWNTOWN

03:25.583 --> 03:28.291
IN ORDER THAT YOU HAVE
PLENTY OF TIME TO FIND IT

03:28.291 --> 03:30.125
IN THE MAZE THAT
IS GREENWICH VILLAGE?

03:30.125 --> 03:31.333
YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE LATE.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.834
THIS IS A VERY,
VERY FAST-PACED CITY.

03:33.834 --> 03:35.291
Jen:
I'LL TRY TO KEEP UP.

04:00.959 --> 04:02.291
WITTER.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.750
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?
IT'S DITCH DAY.

04:04.750 --> 04:06.125
WELL, I HEARD
YOU'D BE HERE, DRUE.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.542
AND FAR BE IT FOR ME
TO MISS OUT

04:07.542 --> 04:09.208
ON EVEN
THE SMALLEST MORSEL
OF YOUR FLAMBOYANT WIT.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.583
THANK YOU.
THE ADMINISTRATION

04:11.583 --> 04:13.208
HAS KINDLY INFORMED
ME THAT, UH,

04:13.208 --> 04:16.834
GIVEN MY QUESTIONABLE
ATTENDANCE AND
DISCIPLINARY RECORDS,

04:16.834 --> 04:18.916
THAT PARTICIPATION
IN POTENTIAL DITCHING

04:18.916 --> 04:21.250
WOULD RESULT IN
FAILURE TO GRADUATE.

04:21.250 --> 04:22.083
SO I TOLD THEM
TO STICK IT.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.875
AND YET
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

04:24.875 --> 04:26.041
FUNNY HOW THAT WORKS.

04:26.041 --> 04:28.291
YEAH. THEY CALLED
MY MOTHER.

04:31.792 --> 04:34.417
LOOK, DRUE, I HAVE
THIS QUIZ RIGHT NOW,

04:34.417 --> 04:36.333
AND IT'S REALLY
MORE OF A TEST
THAN A QUIZ.

04:36.333 --> 04:38.041
HE JUST LIKES
TO CALL THEM QUIZZES.

04:38.041 --> 04:40.000
I ALSO HAVE A LOT
OF STUDYING TO DO, SO--

04:40.000 --> 04:41.166
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

04:41.166 --> 04:42.250
AFTER THIS QUIZ
OF YOURS,

04:42.250 --> 04:43.917
WHENCE OUR ATTENDANCE
IS DULY NOTED,

04:43.917 --> 04:45.166
YOU AND I BLOW OFF
AFTERNOON CLASSES

04:45.166 --> 04:47.583
AND WE
GO GET DANGEROUS?

04:47.583 --> 04:51.333
BOY, THAT SOUNDS
REAL TEMPTING, BUT NO.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.625
WITTER. SOMETIMES...

04:52.625 --> 04:55.041
YOU JUST GOT TO SAY
WHAT THE HELL
AND LIVE A LITTLE.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.500
YES, BUT, YOU SEE,
I HAVE THIS TEST TODAY,

04:56.500 --> 04:58.458
AND THEN I HAVE
ANOTHER TEST TOMORROW

04:58.458 --> 04:59.792
THAT'S TWICE AS BIG.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.208
OUCH.
HATE TO BE YOU.

05:01.208 --> 05:03.542
DOES MAKE YOU
WONDER, THOUGH.

05:04.959 --> 05:06.458
WONDER WHAT?

05:06.458 --> 05:08.291
WHAT IT IS JOEY'S
DOING AT THIS MOMENT

05:08.291 --> 05:11.333
AS YOU ROT AWAY
IN ACADEMIC PRISON.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.291
JEN LINDLEY?

05:28.291 --> 05:28.959
I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.125
Both: OHH!

05:30.125 --> 05:32.667
HA HA HA!
PRINCESS OF SOHO,

05:32.667 --> 05:33.792
LOVE OF MY LIFE.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.333
LOOK AT YOU.
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR HAIR?

05:36.333 --> 05:38.041
JOEY, THIS IS TYPO.
TYPO, THIS IS JOEY.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.291
TYPO.
YOU HAPPEN TO
BE LOOKING AT

05:39.291 --> 05:42.291
ONE OF THE VERY BEST
PEOPLE IN A CITY
OF 12 MILLION,

05:42.291 --> 05:44.834
NOT TO MENTION THE FUTURE
OF THE EXPRESSIONIST MOVEMENT.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.333
SHE KNOWS THAT FLATTERY
WILL GET HER EVERYWHERE.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.291
SO WHAT BRINGS
YOU TWO LADIES
TO THE CITY?

05:49.291 --> 05:51.500
WELL, UH, JOEY'S
TAKING CARE OF ME.
SHE'S MY KEEPER.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.333
WELL,
YOU ALWAYS NEEDED
ONE OF THOSE.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.583
HEY!

05:54.583 --> 05:56.375
SHE'S ALSO JUST
NEVER SEEN NEW YORK.

05:56.375 --> 05:57.333
NEVER?

05:57.333 --> 05:58.792
WHAT KIND OF
YOUNG LADY'S

05:58.792 --> 05:59.917
NEVER BEEN
TO MANHATTAN?

05:59.917 --> 06:00.834
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHERE YOU BUY
YOUR CLOTHES.

06:00.834 --> 06:03.125
OK, COME ON,
SIT DOWN FOR A SECOND.

06:03.125 --> 06:05.667
I WANT TO KNOW
EVERYTHING
ABOUT EVERYONE.

06:05.667 --> 06:06.792
WHAT'S EVERYBODY
DOING?

06:06.792 --> 06:09.500
WHO'S MARRIED?
WHO'S PREGNANT?

06:09.500 --> 06:11.125
ANYONE DIE?

06:11.125 --> 06:12.417
WE'RE ALL STILL HERE.

06:12.417 --> 06:13.667
SOME WE DON'T SEE
SO MUCH ANYMORE.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.667
REALLY?
I STILL TRY AND
MEET BEN AND MONICA

06:15.667 --> 06:18.542
FOR LUNCH AT
BARNEY GREENGRASS
ON WEDNESDAYS.

06:18.542 --> 06:21.166
TODAY.
TODAY'S WEDNESDAY.
I KNOW.

06:21.166 --> 06:22.458
JOEY, I CANNOT
WAIT TO SHOW YOU
THIS PLACE--

06:22.458 --> 06:23.542
JEN, AREN'T WE FORGETTING
ABOUT THAT MEETING

06:23.542 --> 06:25.041
YOU HAVE WITH
THE ADMISSIONS GUY

06:25.041 --> 06:25.959
FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF NEW YORK?

06:25.959 --> 06:28.375
YOU'RE APPLYING
TO THE UNIVERSITY?

06:28.375 --> 06:31.250
OH, ACTUALLY, I GOT IN.
I JUST GOTTA GO
MEET THE GUY.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.875
Typo: BABY, IS IT
POSSIBLE THAT WE'RE
GONNA GET YOU BACK?

06:33.875 --> 06:37.250
I'M CONTEMPLATING IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:37.250 --> 06:38.542
DUMB QUESTION.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.083
WELL,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

06:40.083 --> 06:42.208
I MEAN, IT'S SO FAR AWAY
FROM WHERE WE LIVE, JEN.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.208
I MEAN, HONESTLY,

06:45.208 --> 06:46.583
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THERE IS EVEN ANY DEBATE

06:46.583 --> 06:49.333
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
YOU WANNA GO BACK.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.250
WHAT ABOUT THAT THING
THAT THEY ALWAYS SAY,

06:51.250 --> 06:53.500
THOUGH, YOU KNOW,
THAT YOU CAN NEVER
REALLY GO HOME AGAIN?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.083
MR. WITTER.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.333
MY FAVORITE
AND ONLY SENIOR.

07:05.333 --> 07:07.208
FAR AS I KNOW,
ALL THE COLLEGE
ACCEPTANCE LETTERS

07:07.208 --> 07:08.792
HAVE OFFICIALLY
BEEN SENT.

07:08.792 --> 07:09.750
HOW ARE
YOUR OPTIONS?

07:09.750 --> 07:13.542
THEY ARE NARROWING
BY THE MINUTE, SIR.

07:13.542 --> 07:14.959
WELL, RELAX.

07:14.959 --> 07:15.750
THIS QUIZ IS
THE FIRST QUIZ

07:15.750 --> 07:16.750
OF THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE.

07:22.917 --> 07:23.708
[LOUD POP]

07:39.333 --> 07:40.792
[SIGHS]

07:41.625 --> 07:45.166
[GROANS]

07:45.166 --> 07:48.417
WELL...
THIS HAPPENED.

07:49.625 --> 07:51.417
THAT'S IT?

07:51.417 --> 07:52.917
THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY?

07:52.917 --> 07:56.166
AFTER 6 HOURS
ON THE ROAD?

07:56.166 --> 07:57.458
"THIS HAPPENED"?

07:57.458 --> 07:58.291
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO HAVE A SPARE?

07:58.291 --> 08:00.333
SUPPOSED TO,
YEAH.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.959
HAVE? NO.

08:02.959 --> 08:05.500
I GAVE IT
TO SOME KID WHO
NEEDED A RIDE HOME.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.542
WELL, I'M EXCITED.

08:09.542 --> 08:12.792
I MEAN, THIS IS
EXACTLY THE KIND OF
UNFORESEEN COMPLICATION

08:12.792 --> 08:13.667
THAT MAKES TRIPS
LIKE THIS AN ADVENTURE

08:13.667 --> 08:16.000
AND NOT JUST
AN EXCURSION.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.792
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

08:20.792 --> 08:21.792
INSPIRATION.

08:23.834 --> 08:24.500
AND NOW I'M GONNA
GO USE MY BODY

08:24.500 --> 08:26.750
TO HITCHHIKE US A RIDE.

08:26.750 --> 08:27.500
BUT YOU BETTER HIDE,
'CAUSE NOBODY'S
GONNA PICK UP

08:27.500 --> 08:28.500
A BABE AND HER BOYFRIEND.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.458
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT SO CRAZY

08:30.458 --> 08:31.375
ABOUT THE
HITCHHIKING IDEA.

08:31.375 --> 08:32.332
WHY NOT?

08:32.332 --> 08:33.667
YOU EVER SEE
THE HITCHER?

08:33.667 --> 08:35.166
RUTGER HAUER?
MM-HMM.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.833
JUST TRUST ME,
WE'LL REGRET IT.

08:37.833 --> 08:39.417
OK, WELL, WHAT, THEN?

08:39.417 --> 08:41.542
UH...

08:43.291 --> 08:44.542
WALKING DISTANCE.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.333
[GROANS]
COME ON,

08:47.333 --> 08:48.875
YOU'RE UP
FOR ADVENTURE.

08:59.625 --> 09:02.542
Dr. Rochford:
MR. WITTER?

09:19.542 --> 09:22.375
JEN, UM,
WHAT DID THEY SAY

09:22.375 --> 09:24.041
THE NAME OF
THE ADMISSIONS GUY WAS?

09:24.041 --> 09:28.917
UH, THOMAS, UH,
STEVENSON--TON.

09:28.917 --> 09:30.834
BECAUSE YOU SAID
STEVE THOMPSON

09:30.834 --> 09:31.959
THE LAST TIME I ASKED,

09:31.959 --> 09:35.458
AND THE TIME BEFORE THAT
YOU SAID THOMAS STETSON.

09:35.458 --> 09:37.834
ONE OF THOSE.
I--I FORGET.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.333
YOU DON'T HAVE A MEETING
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF NEW YORK, DO YOU?

09:46.250 --> 09:48.458
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

09:50.250 --> 09:50.875
I GOTTA SEE MY DAD.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.417
I'VE JUST BEEN
THINKING ABOUT
THINGS LATELY,

09:55.417 --> 09:57.083
WHY THINGS ARE
THE WAY THEY ARE,

09:57.083 --> 09:59.458
AND, UH, I THINK
I'M JUST NOT
GONNA KNOW

09:59.458 --> 10:00.542
UNTIL I SEE HIM.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.417
BUT YOU SHOULD
TAKE IN THE CITY.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.875
YOU ONLY GOT ONE DAY
AND YOU GOT SO
MUCH STUFF TO SEE.

10:05.875 --> 10:09.041
AND I'M, YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

10:09.041 --> 10:11.250
MOST LIKELY.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.417
YOU JUST GOT
TO MEET ME AT 8:00

10:12.417 --> 10:13.917
IN FRONT OF
THE MERCER HOTEL
FOR DINNER, OK?

10:14.917 --> 10:18.250
YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION
TO MY SCHEDULE.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.458
BE CAREFUL
OUT THERE.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.250
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT
GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.834
YOU WILL.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.250
YEAH, I WILL.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.375
WHAT?

10:31.375 --> 10:34.542
I'M COMING WITH YOU.
I'M YOUR KEEPER.

10:34.542 --> 10:35.542
[LAUGHS]

10:58.166 --> 10:59.333
IS IT JUST ME
OR DOES THIS SEEM

10:59.333 --> 11:01.291
EERILY LIKE
THE TWILIGHT ZONE?

11:01.291 --> 11:03.083
IT IS.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.834
THERE ANYONE HERE?

MR. LINDLEY, SHE'S
TOO MODEST TO SAY IT,

21:15.417 --> 21:16.458
BUT JEN
WAS ACCEPTED TO 5

21:16.458 --> 21:18.291
OUT OF THE 6 COLLEGES
THAT SHE APPLIED TO.

21:18.291 --> 21:23.083
HONEY, THAT'S FANTASTIC!
THAT'S REALLY EXCELLENT.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.250
SEE, WHEN I
APPLIED TO SCHOOL,

21:24.250 --> 21:26.417
I WAS ONLY ACCEPTED AT ONE,
YOU KNOW. PRINCETON.

21:26.417 --> 21:29.583
BUT IT MADE
THE DECISION-MAKING
PROCESS A LOT EASIER.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.708
WELL, JEN HAS
A LOT OF CHOICES.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.667
SHE ALSO HAS
IMPECCABLE JUDGMENT.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.083
SO, WHAT
ABOUT YOU, JOEY?

21:36.083 --> 21:37.375
YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE HEADED?

21:37.375 --> 21:39.959
UH, I THINK
I'M HEADED TO BOSTON.

21:39.959 --> 21:42.583
OH, JEEZ!
WHAT ABOUT NEW YORK?

21:42.583 --> 21:45.000
THIS WHOLE CITY
IS AN EDUCATION

21:45.000 --> 21:47.166
AND AN INSPIRATION.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

21:47.166 --> 21:48.417
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK IT'S KIND OF BIG.

21:48.417 --> 21:50.583
BIG? YEAH,
NO KIDDING IT'S BIG.

21:50.583 --> 21:51.792
IT'S THE BIGGEST CITY
IN THE COUNTRY.

21:51.792 --> 21:52.625
EVEN THOUGH
THE ISLAND ITSELF

21:52.625 --> 21:54.708
DOESN'T HAVE
THAT MUCH SPACE.

21:54.708 --> 21:56.000
BUT IT'S AMAZING,
YOU KNOW,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.250
I HAVE LIVED HERE
FOR 30 YEARS,

21:57.250 --> 22:00.041
AND, UH,
IT STILL CONTINUES

22:00.041 --> 22:01.500
TO SURPRISE ME
EVERY DAY.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.792
HOW?

22:04.792 --> 22:05.959
HOW WHAT?

22:05.959 --> 22:08.834
HOW DOES IT
SURPRISE YOU EVERY DAY?

22:11.792 --> 22:12.542
GOOD QUESTION.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.458
A CITY LIKE NEW YORK

22:16.458 --> 22:17.417
WHERE EVERYTHING'S
MOVING ALL THE TIME

22:17.417 --> 22:21.792
AT THIS CONSTANT
DRIVING PACE, RIGHT?

22:21.792 --> 22:25.458
IT'S LIKE
A LIVING ORGANISM

22:25.458 --> 22:27.583
BREATHING AND CHANGING,

22:27.583 --> 22:29.417
AND OVER TIME
YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO IT

22:29.417 --> 22:34.250
BECOMES LIKE
THIS INCREDIBLE ROMANCE,

22:34.250 --> 22:36.000
YOU KNOW?

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
AT FIRST,
IT'S INTOXICATING,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.500
IRRESISTIBLE,

22:41.500 --> 22:44.208
AND THEN SLOWLY
IT BECOMES

22:44.208 --> 22:47.125
COMFORTABLE AND SAFE.

22:47.125 --> 22:49.458
YOU HAVE THIS CELLULAR
CONNECTION TO IT,

22:49.458 --> 22:52.166
AS IF YOU'VE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOREVER,

22:52.166 --> 22:53.750
LIKE YOUR
OLDEST HAPPINESS,

22:53.750 --> 22:55.500
AND SOMETIMES
YOU'RE ON THE OUTS,

22:55.500 --> 22:58.917
AND SOMETIMES
YOU'RE MAKING UP,

22:58.917 --> 23:01.041
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN
YOU CATCH YOURSELF

23:01.041 --> 23:02.333
IN THIS
TRANSCENDENT MOMENT

23:02.333 --> 23:06.458
WHERE YOU THINK
TO YOURSELF,

23:08.166 --> 23:09.625
"OH, MY GOD,

23:09.625 --> 23:12.667
"I'M MADLY
IN LOVE WITH YOU,

23:12.667 --> 23:14.708
AND I ALWAYS WILL BE."

23:19.542 --> 23:22.667
AND I THINK THAT'S
WHEN IT SURPRISES ME.

23:25.417 --> 23:28.125
WHOA, THAT'S
A GOOD ANSWER.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.708
I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING.

23:40.708 --> 23:43.583
WELL, THAT'S
JUST TOO DAMN BAD,
ISN'T IT?

23:45.542 --> 23:46.667
PLEASE?

23:46.667 --> 23:48.542
HEH HEH! I'M SORRY.

23:48.542 --> 23:49.959
I LOVE TRAVELING
WITH YOU,

23:49.959 --> 23:51.125
BUT I SIMPLY
CANNOT GIVE YOU
YOUR SANDWICH

23:51.125 --> 23:53.625
UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO FIX
THIS SITUATION

23:53.625 --> 23:55.333
AND GET US
MOVING AGAIN.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.542
IT'S A PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU

23:56.542 --> 23:57.667
TO RISE
TO THE OCCASION.

23:57.667 --> 23:58.250
YOU KNOW I'M STARVING.

23:58.250 --> 24:01.083
MMM. I CAN IMAGINE.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.500
YOU HAVEN'T HAD
YOUR BEEF SANDWICH,

24:02.500 --> 24:05.208
AND DID YOU KNOW
WILLOWBY WAS FAMOUS

24:05.208 --> 24:06.750
FOR THEIR
BEEF SANDWICHES?

24:07.917 --> 24:10.333
OK, WE'LL WALK
BACK INTO TOWN,

24:10.333 --> 24:11.542
CALL MY PARENTS,
HAVE THEM WIRE US MONEY.

24:11.542 --> 24:14.208
OK, FIRST OF ALL,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

24:14.208 --> 24:15.417
WHAT IT MEANS
TO WIRE MONEY?

24:15.417 --> 24:17.542
I--I'VE SEEN
THE COMMERCIALS.

24:17.542 --> 24:20.458
IT'S THE FASTEST WAY
TO SEND MONEY.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.667
HEH!
AND SECOND OF ALL,

24:22.667 --> 24:24.583
HOW DID
YOUR EXPERIENCE
OF WILLOWBY

24:24.583 --> 24:26.417
SO RADICALLY
DIFFER FROM MINE

24:26.417 --> 24:27.834
TO THE POINT
YOU BELIEVE
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE

24:27.834 --> 24:29.083
A 24-HOUR
WESTERN UNION?

24:32.667 --> 24:34.000
GUGGGH!

24:36.417 --> 24:38.583
HAND OVER THOSE
DOLLAR BILLS, BOYS,

24:38.583 --> 24:40.000
YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH DADDY NOW.

24:40.000 --> 24:40.625
OHH!

24:40.625 --> 24:42.458
HOW YOU BOYS DOING?

24:42.458 --> 24:43.917
QUITE WELL.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.000

A GOOD TIME?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.917
MIGHTY
BIG FUN, MACK.
MIGHTY BIG FUN.

24:46.917 --> 24:49.375
DAVE? DAVE!

24:49.375 --> 24:51.375
YEAH. YEAH, DAVE.

24:51.375 --> 24:52.875
YOU'RE FROM
RHODE ISLAND, RIGHT?

24:52.875 --> 24:56.250
YES, I WAS BORN
AND RAISED
IN RHODE ISLAND.

24:56.250 --> 24:58.583
HEY, ME, TOO.
WHAT BROUGHT YOU
TO MY ESTABLISHMENT?

25:00.417 --> 25:02.333
I WAS IN SEARCH OF,
YOU KNOW,

25:02.333 --> 25:03.750
GOOD FOLKS, GOOD FUN,

25:03.750 --> 25:06.000
AND YOU, SIR,
HAVE PLENTY OF BOTH.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.417
WELL, THANKS, DAVE,
I APPRECIATE THAT,

25:08.417 --> 25:10.166
REALLY, BUT, UM,
THAT'S NOT REALLY
WHAT I MEANT.

25:11.166 --> 25:14.667
WHAT I MEANT
WAS WHAT HIGHWAY

25:14.667 --> 25:20.000
BROUGHT YOU
FROM RHODE ISLAND
TO MY ESTABLISHMENT?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.792

IS SPENT, GILBERT.

GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

26:10.542 --> 26:11.834
IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS,
BUT I HAVE TO HEAD BACK

TO TAKE CARE

26:12.875 --> 26:14.041

BUSINESS STUFF.

26:14.041 --> 26:15.959

BUT YOU KNOW.

26:15.959 --> 26:18.708
GO AHEAD AND ORDER
ANYTHING MORE YOU WANT.

THAT YOUR TASTE BUDS

26:20.041 --> 26:22.291
HAVE YET TO BE SATISFIED.

NEVER GONNA FIND

BETTER THAN ANYONE.

NICE MEETING--

AFTER YOUR MOM

AT GRAND CENTRAL

WANDERING AROUND THE CITY,

28:30.583 --> 28:32.166
WHERE DID YOU SLEEP?

28:35.834 --> 28:38.667

WITH REALITY'S.

33:03.542 --> 33:04.875
AND I DIDN'T
HEAR ANYTHING,

33:04.875 --> 33:06.333
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

33:06.333 --> 33:09.708
I WAS JUST RESTING.
I'M AWAKE NOW.

33:09.708 --> 33:12.959
AND THEN I HE-HEARD,
UM, SOMETHING.

33:12.959 --> 33:14.583
I HEARD A VOICE,

33:14.583 --> 33:16.708
A WHIMPER,

33:16.708 --> 33:20.291
VERY FAR AWAY.

33:20.291 --> 33:23.959
AND THEN
I HEARD IT AGAIN.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.500
AND THAT'S WHEN
I RECOGNIZED IT.

33:27.500 --> 33:31.083
I--I KNEW
THAT IT WAS ANNIE.

33:32.291 --> 33:33.750
WHO?

33:35.041 --> 33:37.959

33:37.959 --> 33:39.125
SHE LIVED
IN THE APARTMENT

33:39.125 --> 33:41.583
DOWNSTAIRS
WITH HER PARENTS,

33:42.375 --> 33:44.291
AND SHE WAS
PROBABLY THE AGE

33:44.291 --> 33:45.959
I AM RIGHT NOW.

33:51.792 --> 33:54.583
SHE WAS
MY FAVORITE PERSON
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.333
AND SHE WAS
IN OUR APARTMENT?

34:02.333 --> 34:04.208
YOU WERE
HAVING SEX WITH HER.

34:08.041 --> 34:10.083
BUT YOU
WERE CARELESS.

34:10.083 --> 34:14.041
YOU LEFT YOUR
BEDROOM DOOR OPEN,

34:14.041 --> 34:17.417
AND I COULD SEE IN
FROM THE HALLWAY.

34:17.417 --> 34:18.958
I COULD SEE
THROUGH THE OPENING.
IT WAS--

34:18.958 --> 34:20.083
JENNIFER,
YOU NEED SOME HELP.

34:20.083 --> 34:23.000
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO ANYONE ABOUT THIS?

34:23.000 --> 34:26.125
AND I BACKED
DOWN THE HALL,

34:26.125 --> 34:28.542
AND I WENT
DOWN THE STAIRS,

34:28.542 --> 34:30.250
AND I SLIPPED OUT
THE FRONT DOOR,

34:30.250 --> 34:31.625
AND I DISAPPEARED

NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPENED

AND MESSIER,

35:23.750 --> 35:26.250

YOU SENT ME AWAY.

YOU--YOU MADE ME
FEEL ASHAMED. YOU--

35:33.959 --> 35:35.750

FOR ALL THESE THINGS

35:35.750 --> 35:38.041

MY CONTROL.

35:38.041 --> 35:39.375
YOU SAW ME STANDING
IN THE DOORWAY.

OHH! AND YOU
NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

FOR ALL THE PAIN
THAT YOU'VE CAUSED ME,

35:56.625 --> 35:58.417

HAVE TO FORGIVE YOU.

36:01.291 --> 36:04.125
ALL I HAVE TO DO

36:04.125 --> 36:06.125
IS FORGIVE MYSELF

36:06.125 --> 36:10.375
FOR THESE THINGS
