07:42.170 --> 07:44.172
Oh, I like people who hug.

of relentless rehearsal

08:14.077 --> 08:15.829
to make it

08:15.870 --> 08:17.164

08:20.959 --> 08:23.211
Rebecca, no offense

08:23.253 --> 08:26.047
but have you ever hosted

08:23.253 --> 08:26.047
a talk show before?

08:26.089 --> 08:27.841
As a matter of fact, I have.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.093
A.M. Omaha, for two years.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.180
How about you? Have you ever

08:30.135 --> 08:33.180
hosted a talk show?

08:33.221 --> 08:35.265
That's kind of personal.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.145
It's party time.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.483
'Almost.'

08:44.524 --> 08:46.443
Michelle, you're supposed

08:44.524 --> 08:46.443
to be in the kitchen

08:46.485 --> 08:48.528
not carrying around pretzels.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.325
'It's okay, Michelle.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.325
I'll clean it up.'

08:53.367 --> 08:54.659
(Jesse)

08:53.367 --> 08:54.659
'Michelle.'

08:54.701 --> 08:57.412
Oh, you little,

08:54.701 --> 08:57.412
what are you doing here?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.998
What happened?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.998
Alright, come on.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.504
D.J. This is a party.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.755
Is this a party?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.755
Why is everyone so quiet?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.883
They think you're cute.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.222
Where were they when I was 12?

09:15.263 --> 09:17.765
- Not born. Bye.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.765
- Bye-bye.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.354
Okay, I promise that was

09:19.100 --> 09:22.354
the last interruption.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.481
Oh, that's Kimmy.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.481
Everyone get ready.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.359
(all)

09:25.982 --> 09:27.359
Surprise!

09:27.401 --> 09:31.363
For me? You shouldn't have.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.156
We didn't.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.657
What are you doing down here?

09:34.699 --> 09:36.993
I just went to check the mail.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.914
Nothing yet. Ah, pretzels.

09:42.790 --> 09:43.917
Don't mind if I do.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.793
Well, I mind if you do.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.588
Stephanie, please go upstairs.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.549
Oh, dear me, I almost forgot.

09:50.590 --> 09:54.261
I do have a super-duper party

09:50.590 --> 09:54.261
waiting for me upstairs.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.305
Hello, what a pretty sweater.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.182
Love your hair.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.642
We must do this

09:59.224 --> 10:01.642
again sometime.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.189
Surprise!

10:06.231 --> 10:07.648
(all)

10:06.231 --> 10:07.648
Oh!

10:07.690 --> 10:09.984
A surprise party for me!

10:10.026 --> 10:13.029
What a surprise!

10:13.071 --> 10:16.366
D.J., these are the two friends

10:13.071 --> 10:16.366
you said that I could invite.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.784
Nina and Melissa.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.202
They're in junior high.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.371
(all)

10:19.244 --> 10:21.371
Ooh!

10:21.413 --> 10:23.873
I'm D.J.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.873
I'm glad you could make it.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.834
We wouldn't miss a party

10:23.915 --> 10:26.834
for our new pal, Kammy.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.421
- Her name's Kimmy.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.421
- They wear lipstick.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.631
They can call me

10:29.463 --> 10:31.631
whatever they want.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.676
This party is dead.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.886
Hey, is your dad home?

10:36.928 --> 10:38.138
No. He's gone.

10:38.179 --> 10:42.517
Good. This is

10:38.179 --> 10:42.517
a great party house.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.061
Much better than the house

10:42.559 --> 10:45.061
we trashed last weekend.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.189
Where's the phone?

10:48.231 --> 10:49.566
Oh, it's over here.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.860
Let's call Greg,

10:49.608 --> 10:52.860
Andy and the Duke.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.613
Uh, before you call any Dukes

10:54.654 --> 10:56.573
do you mind telling me

10:54.654 --> 10:56.573
what you're doing?

10:56.615 --> 11:00.368
Don't worry. In an hour

10:56.615 --> 11:00.368
we'll have 50 or 60 kids here.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.121
(Melissa)

11:01.411 --> 11:03.121
'Hello, Duke.'

11:03.163 --> 11:04.372
What's the address here?

11:04.414 --> 11:07.000
Uh, hello, Duke,

11:04.414 --> 11:07.000
this is a crank call.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.504
What a dweeb!

11:10.545 --> 11:12.880
Hey, this party isn't

11:10.545 --> 11:12.880
for you and your friends.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.758
It's a party

11:12.922 --> 11:15.758
for Kimmy and her friends.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.927
D.J., you're messing

11:15.800 --> 11:17.927
everything up.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.804
Don't you get it?

11:17.969 --> 11:19.804
They're in<i> junior high.</i>

11:19.846 --> 11:20.972
Who cares?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.974
This is the land of the lame.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.268
Come on, Kimmy,

11:23.016 --> 11:25.268
let's get out of here.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.729
Kimmy, wait. You can't leave

11:25.310 --> 11:28.729
your own birthday party.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.359
You can't tell me what to do.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.027
I'm not telling you what to do.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.529
I'm just saying

11:34.068 --> 11:35.529
don't act dumb.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.906
- Oh, now I'm dumb.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.906
- You are if you stay here.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.034
Come on, the mall's

11:38.948 --> 11:41.034
open till nine.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.206
Let's do it.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.626
[instrumental music]

11:57.175 --> 11:58.552
[instrumental music]

12:00.303 --> 12:02.721
There will be

12:00.303 --> 12:02.721
no talking in class.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.560
Everyone turn to page..

12:08.019 --> 12:10.938
Mr. Bear, if it's so funny

12:10.980 --> 12:13.107
why don't you share it

12:10.980 --> 12:13.107
with everybody.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.697
Hi, D.J. Wanna play school?

12:18.737 --> 12:20.865
No. I wanna quit school.

12:20.907 --> 12:24.452
Is that because you

12:20.907 --> 12:24.452
ate lunch by yourself today?

12:24.494 --> 12:28.081
I wasn't eating by myself.

12:24.494 --> 12:28.081
I was eating alone.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.625
There's a big difference.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.751
Any questions, class?

12:34.170 --> 12:37.382
Yes, Mr. Bear?

12:37.424 --> 12:40.051
Mr. Bear wants to know

12:37.424 --> 12:40.051
why all the kids in school

12:40.093 --> 12:42.178
were calling you

12:40.093 --> 12:42.178
a "geek burger"?

12:43.762 --> 12:46.474
Mr. Bear is going

12:43.762 --> 12:46.474
to the principal's office.

12:50.811 --> 12:53.064
That's the cafeteria.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.569
I told them

12:54.857 --> 12:57.569
you weren't a geek burger.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.113
Then they called

12:57.611 --> 13:00.113
me "geek burger junior."

13:01.281 --> 13:03.283
How rude!

13:04.284 --> 13:06.077
It's all Kimmy's fault.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.787
She hates my guts because I

13:06.119 --> 13:08.787
wouldn't let her<i> stupid</i> friends

13:08.829 --> 13:12.041
take over the party

13:08.829 --> 13:12.041
and wreck my house.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.628
Now she turned

13:12.083 --> 13:14.628
the whole school against me.

13:14.669 --> 13:18.881
Don't feel bad. I know

13:14.669 --> 13:18.881
you're not a geek burger.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.467
Thanks.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.469
And you're not

13:20.508 --> 13:22.469
a geek burger junior.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.554
Thanks back.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.515
But until this blows over..

13:29.267 --> 13:31.436
...I think

13:29.267 --> 13:31.436
I'll change my name.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.649
To..

13:35.690 --> 13:38.485
...Connie Chung.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.612
[instrumental music]

13:44.658 --> 13:47.826
Danny, the TV is fine.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.826
Will you stop windex-ing?

13:47.868 --> 13:49.537
Come on, we're dying

13:47.868 --> 13:49.537
to watch your first show.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.289
Okay, okay.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.708
Don't show the tape

13:51.331 --> 13:53.708
till Uncle Jesse gets here.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.710
Oh, the tape.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.710
I knew I forgot something.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.545
No, I have it.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.545
It's in my bag.

13:57.587 --> 14:00.256
What a team.

13:57.587 --> 14:00.256
I forget, and you remember.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.011
- There it is.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.011
- That's a groovy..

14:05.052 --> 14:09.056
Have mercy. Hi.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.518
Hi. You must be Jesse,

14:09.098 --> 14:11.518
Danny's brother-in-law.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.019
Danny told me about you.

14:13.060 --> 14:16.314
Oh, yeah? What did he say?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.525
He said he had

14:16.356 --> 14:18.525
a brother-in-law named Jesse.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.403
Oh.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.739
Thanks for the build-up, pal.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.741
So you must be Rebecca?

14:26.783 --> 14:28.909
No, please,

14:26.783 --> 14:28.909
please call me Becky.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.078
Becky. I like that.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.373
Becky, Becky, Becky.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.000
Uh, so, Becky, I was gonna get

14:33.414 --> 14:36.000
something to drink.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.085
- Would you like something?

14:36.042 --> 14:38.085
- Sure, what do you got?

14:38.127 --> 14:40.254
- What do you like?

14:38.127 --> 14:40.254
- Whatever you have.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.715
Why don't we

14:40.296 --> 14:41.715
get it together, huh?

14:41.756 --> 14:43.675
- Okay.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.675
- That's<i> fascinating.</i>

14:43.717 --> 14:45.802
I can see why you have

14:43.717 --> 14:45.802
your own talk show.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.680
D.J., is everything okay?

14:48.722 --> 14:51.265
Yeah. Fine, dad.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.265
I can't wait to watch your show.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.645
So have you found

14:53.059 --> 14:55.645
an apartment yet?

14:55.687 --> 14:57.146
Oh, I found plenty of them.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.691
The problem is they all have

14:57.188 --> 14:59.691
people living inside.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.860
[laughing]

14:59.733 --> 15:01.860
People..

15:01.901 --> 15:04.654
See, I find sense of humor very

15:01.901 --> 15:04.654
attractive in a woman.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.408
You know,

15:05.864 --> 15:08.408
this is gonna sound weird

15:08.449 --> 15:10.702
but you remind me of someone.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.413
Oh, yeah?

15:14.539 --> 15:17.041
Who's that?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.334
It's silly.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.334
You don't wanna hear it.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.627
- No, go ahead.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.627
- No. It's ridiculous!

15:19.669 --> 15:21.671
People tell me all the time.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.671
Go ahead.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.715
Come on, pretty mama,

15:21.713 --> 15:23.715
lay it on me.

15:26.175 --> 15:30.137
- You remind me of Corky.

15:26.175 --> 15:30.137
- Yeah. See, people tell, Corky?

15:30.179 --> 15:31.138
My little baby brother.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.181
You know, he used to do that

15:32.223 --> 15:35.268
same cute Elvis voice.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.896
I remind you

15:35.309 --> 15:37.896
of your little baby brother?

15:37.937 --> 15:40.106
Yeah, it's uncanny.

15:40.147 --> 15:43.276
Corky and I would go up to

15:40.147 --> 15:43.276
Sutter's pond to catch frogs.

15:43.317 --> 15:46.320
And he would always say..

15:46.362 --> 15:48.531
..."come on,

15:46.362 --> 15:48.531
little froggy mama."

15:50.366 --> 15:52.452
Elvis never said that.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.538
You really are cute.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.835
We are so far

15:58.207 --> 16:00.835
from where I wanna be.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.548
Okay, now remember,

16:02.962 --> 16:05.548
this is our first show

16:05.590 --> 16:06.758
so we were a little bit nervous.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.551
- Play the tape.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.551
- Just play it.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.010
Why don't I just play the tape?

16:10.052 --> 16:12.472
(all)

16:10.052 --> 16:12.472
Great idea.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.807
Here we go.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.975
♪ Wake up ♪♪

16:16.851 --> 16:18.018
Good morning.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.229
It's time to wake up,

16:18.060 --> 16:20.229
San Francisco.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.482
- I'm Danny Tanner.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.482
- And I'm Rebecca Donaldson.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.233
And we'd like

16:22.523 --> 16:24.233
to know all your names

16:24.275 --> 16:27.027
but we're only an hour show

16:24.275 --> 16:27.027
and we've only got one phone.
