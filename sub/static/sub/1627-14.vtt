Yes. I haven't spoken to her

and all her things were gone.

That's what she told me.

No. I know when people are telling
the truth, David, and you are.

to see some fireflies, not loving me.

27:59.762 --> 28:02.629
That's not possible. He said
he didn't speak to her that day.

28:02.723 --> 28:03.678
Then he's lying.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.973
No. I know when someone is lying
and David...

Without even saying goodbye?

29:28.851 --> 29:30.762
Well, well, where are you going?

29:30.853 --> 29:34.641
To be with Nova. We're in love.
We're gonna see the world together.

29:34.732 --> 29:35.721
I don't understand.

29:35.816 --> 29:38.228
I thought we were meant to live
our lives here, in the mines.

You can't go to her.

30:19.652 --> 30:20.858

Who are you?

30:49.932 --> 30:51.843
l'm Nova's teacher.

30:51.934 --> 30:55.722
And if the two of you run away
together, it will not end well.

30:56.272 --> 30:58.228
Nova will lose her wings.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.936
But if you return to the mines,

31:01.027 --> 31:04.986
and if you allow Nova to become
the fairy that she was meant to be,

31:05.072 --> 31:09.031
the two of you will bring untold joy
to the world.

31:09.118 --> 31:12.736
Nova can be a great fairy,

31:13.622 --> 31:15.362
if you let her.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.616
The choice is yours.

31:27.094 --> 31:28.709
Leroy, you understand
that a relationship

31:28.804 --> 31:31.762
between you and Sister Astrid
can never happen?

31:31.849 --> 31:33.305
Yeah, yeah.

31:33.642 --> 31:38.261
My whole life, people made it their
business to tell me what I can't do.

31:38.355 --> 31:41.813
She was the first person
that said I could do anything.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.103
Who believed in me.

31:45.696 --> 31:47.311
I didn't want to disappoint her.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.237
But there are consequences
to following through

31:49.325 --> 31:51.691
when the world tells you not to.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.448
I mean, look at me.

was a moment with Astrid.

One moment to give me hope
that any dream is possible.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.245
You've had all that, Mary Margaret.

32:35.329 --> 32:39.163

for yourself and enjoy it.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.287
