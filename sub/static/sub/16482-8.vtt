00:03.022 --> 00:04.830
I can't fall for a fat person right now.

00:04.841 --> 00:07.308
It's always gonna be about
the weight for me, Toby.

William: I wonder if I could
check on him from time to time.

00:19.972 --> 00:21.008
No.

00:21.018 --> 00:23.334
Hey, Mom! Hey, Miguel.

00:23.344 --> 00:25.026
I'm Rebecca. I'm Randall's mother.

00:25.028 --> 00:26.427
Very nice to meet you.

00:26.429 --> 00:28.312
Uh, nice to meet you as well.

00:28.314 --> 00:32.283
Beth: It's in the book of poems that
Randall's had since he was a baby.

00:32.284 --> 00:34.635
The one I gave Rebecca back in the day.

00:34.637 --> 00:37.354
Beth: Rebecca, this is Beth.
Yeah, um, so William just told me

00:37.356 --> 00:39.256

"Okay, okay, now one

01:49.082 --> 01:52.100
I will talk to them about that. Again.

Jack: Okay, get excited, people.
Annual Thanksgiving road trip.

01:56.068 --> 01:58.000
I've got snacks.

01:58.010 --> 01:59.753
I got Cool Ranch.

01:59.755 --> 02:01.738
I've got Paul Simon.

02:01.740 --> 02:04.239
- Now everyone, go pee.
- We already peed.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.410
Go pee again,
six-hour road trip, come on.

02:06.412 --> 02:08.845
- Go, go, go. Go, go, go.
- But... but we already went.

02:08.847 --> 02:11.765
Don't get anything
on your chinos, please.

02:11.767 --> 02:14.815
Do you hear me?
They inherited your aim, Jack.

02:15.608 --> 02:17.701
(laughs) Hey, cranberry looks great.

02:17.711 --> 02:20.223
I know. Great is not good enough,
it has to be perfect.

02:20.225 --> 02:22.671
Because my sister's sweet
potato pie is gonna be perfect,

02:22.681 --> 02:25.595
and I can't stand to hear my
mother's passive-aggressive BS

02:25.597 --> 02:27.464
if my sauce is not absolutely perfect.

02:27.466 --> 02:30.203
Perfect. Babe, it is perfect.

02:30.213 --> 02:32.352
It is, it's perfect.
Or, as your mother would say,

02:32.354 --> 02:33.770
"Becky, it's to die for." (gasps)

02:33.772 --> 02:35.900
- Can I have the nutmeg, please?
- Oh. Yeah.

02:35.910 --> 02:38.582
I'm sorry. I know this is not a fun way

02:38.592 --> 02:40.427
- to spend the holiday.
- Not fun? Are you kidding me?

02:40.429 --> 02:42.030
Listening to your sister's husband brag

02:42.040 --> 02:44.031
about his expensive CD
player for three hours

02:44.033 --> 02:46.647
is the definition of fun.

02:46.657 --> 02:48.180
So, always thought that,

02:48.190 --> 02:51.304
when my folks die, we get to
do our own thing, you know?

02:51.829 --> 02:55.225
Make up our own stupid
traditions with the kids.

02:55.791 --> 02:59.542
That's because you're a very,
very naive man.

02:59.552 --> 03:01.231
Yeah? Thank you.

03:01.233 --> 03:03.884
(boys yelling, Rebecca screams)

03:04.671 --> 03:06.303

- Oops.

03:06.305 --> 03:07.726
Okay, okay.

03:07.736 --> 03:09.271
- Boys, change, change, change.
- Sorry.

03:09.281 --> 03:11.108
- Step over this and change.
- Randall: Sorry.

03:11.110 --> 03:12.993
Woman: For me it's cranberry sauce.

03:12.995 --> 03:15.327
Sweet potatoes with marshmallow crust.

03:15.337 --> 03:16.805
Bacon wrapped dates.

03:16.815 --> 03:20.183
Jell-O with the little pieces
of fruit floating on the inside

03:20.185 --> 03:21.952
- and then whipped cream on top.
- Oh!

03:21.954 --> 03:23.794
My weakness is stuffing.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.889
- Mm.
- I could eat a whole bowl of it,

03:25.891 --> 03:29.259
but this is my first Thanksgiving
since my gastric bypass surgery,

03:29.269 --> 03:31.011
so my stomach's now
the size of a walnut.

03:31.013 --> 03:34.114
Which means if I overdo it,
I'll be holed up in the bathroom

03:34.116 --> 03:37.779
vomiting my guts out, while everybody
else is watching football. (laughs)

03:37.789 --> 03:39.619
But, hey, I've lost

03:39.621 --> 03:41.316
30 pounds now so far.

03:41.326 --> 03:43.290
So, worth it.

03:43.292 --> 03:45.208
- Right?
- Group Leader: Yes,

03:45.210 --> 03:46.543
yes it is.

03:46.545 --> 03:48.228
Now, for everybody else,

03:48.230 --> 03:50.814
Thanksgiving is full of triggers.

03:50.816 --> 03:52.566
So we have to stay vigilant.

03:52.568 --> 03:54.198
But I know you guys can do it.

03:54.208 --> 03:56.086
(clapping)

04:01.385 --> 04:03.296
(mouth full): This is great.

04:03.306 --> 04:04.645
Mm.

04:04.655 --> 04:06.763
So, Thanksgiving in New York.

04:07.232 --> 04:09.064
It's gonna be great. The Big Apple.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.757
I hope your mom likes me.

04:11.043 --> 04:13.006
- Toby...
- You know, what am I worried about?

04:13.016 --> 04:14.493
Parents love me,
I'll tell them the story

04:14.503 --> 04:18.226
about the time I met Streisand.
Parents love Streisand.

04:19.478 --> 04:22.345
(inhales deeply)

04:22.725 --> 04:25.165
I don't think that you should
come with me to New York.

04:25.167 --> 04:26.665
(laughs)

04:26.675 --> 04:28.586
What? Why? Why not?

04:30.457 --> 04:32.950
Because I think we should take a break.

04:33.936 --> 04:35.308
A... a break?

04:35.310 --> 04:36.793
Mm-hmm.

04:37.222 --> 04:38.478
Why?

04:39.883 --> 04:42.230
Because I've been dreading this date.

04:42.240 --> 04:46.153
Because I knew that you would
eat that and I would eat this.

04:46.734 --> 04:49.991
And because ever since you stopped
dieting, I have felt weak.

04:50.001 --> 04:51.974
Oh, no, I was weak.

04:51.984 --> 04:54.985
The other night I stuffed my
face full of powdered donuts,

04:54.995 --> 04:57.195
and then I cried myself to sleep.

05:00.493 --> 05:03.019
Yup.

05:03.416 --> 05:06.217
And, listen, if you don't want
to lose weight, that's fine

05:06.227 --> 05:09.704
because that's your choice.

05:09.706 --> 05:10.905
(voice breaking): But I told...

05:10.907 --> 05:12.307
(clears throat)

05:12.309 --> 05:14.292
I told you that when I met you,

05:14.294 --> 05:17.528
that I couldn't fall for a fat person.

05:17.530 --> 05:20.214
But you did.

05:20.216 --> 05:22.283
You fell-you fell for me.

05:39.286 --> 05:43.388
where... the perfect,
charming, Hugh-Grant-guy

05:43.390 --> 05:48.459
would bend over backwards
for the woman that he loves.

05:48.461 --> 05:52.931

"If I could have that,

05:52.933 --> 05:54.832
that I would be happy."

05:54.834 --> 05:56.818
And then I met you.

05:58.471 --> 06:00.872
(inhales deeply)

06:00.874 --> 06:02.357
And you were better than them.

07:25.416 --> 07:27.980
My mum's American.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.645
I am definitely not getting

where they'll be playing Rocky II.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.410

Hey, finally, some help.

10:26.178 --> 10:28.619
- You're on potato duty.
- Oh, nice.

10:28.716 --> 10:30.897
What, is that your
potato mashing jacket?

10:30.899 --> 10:33.316
(chuckles) Uh, sorry I can't help you.

10:33.318 --> 10:35.132
I got to pick up Olivia.
I need the keys.

10:35.142 --> 10:37.865
(sighs) It's hanging
up on the wall, man,

10:37.875 --> 10:39.285
right there.

10:39.891 --> 10:40.940
So, when do, uh,

10:40.942 --> 10:44.694
Mom and Miguel get here? Mom and
Miguel get here any minute.

10:44.696 --> 10:46.079
He's our stepdad, not ISIS.

10:46.081 --> 10:47.597
- Oh.
- Hey, don't forget you're in charge

10:47.599 --> 10:49.082
- of picking up the hot dogs.
- I have hot dogs,

10:49.084 --> 10:50.600
- Kraft singles and the saltines.
- Yeah.

10:50.602 --> 10:52.502
It's not my first Pearson Thanksgiving.

10:52.504 --> 10:55.278
(in British accent):
Excited to meet your girlfriend.

10:59.478 --> 11:01.027
Okay, Olivia's not my
girlfriend, okay...

11:01.029 --> 11:02.545
- Okay.
- ...and you're gonna be cool.

11:02.547 --> 11:03.880
Randall, look it, eye contact, please.

11:03.890 --> 11:05.404
- You're gonna be cool, right?
- Oh, baby, I'm as cool

11:05.414 --> 11:07.934
as the other side of the
pillow. You feel me?

11:07.936 --> 11:10.954
Yeah. Yeah, here's the thing.
You're not allowed to talk to her.

11:10.956 --> 11:12.622
Cause she'll want me?

11:12.624 --> 11:14.124
She'll want me so bad.

11:14.126 --> 11:16.343
Thanksgiving Dad is a hot dad.

11:16.345 --> 11:17.627
- Jesus.
- Watch it.

11:17.629 --> 11:18.795
Ah.

11:18.797 --> 11:20.480
- See you in a minute.
- All right.

11:20.482 --> 11:23.366
Hey! There's my turkey team.

11:23.368 --> 11:25.085
Little turkey, medium turkey,

11:25.087 --> 11:26.736
you guys go up to the
attic and bring down

11:26.738 --> 11:28.734
the Thanksgiving picnic
blankets, please.

11:28.744 --> 11:30.040
- Okay.
- On it!

11:30.042 --> 11:31.241
All right.

11:31.243 --> 11:32.625
- Big...
- You call me big turkey...

11:32.627 --> 11:35.261
beautiful, brown eyes.

11:35.263 --> 11:36.563
Mm-hmm, better.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.149
Would you be so kind
as to hook up the VCR

11:39.151 --> 11:40.550
so we can watch the movie later, please?

11:40.552 --> 11:42.052
Yes, give me a minute.

11:42.054 --> 11:43.425
- Okay.
- VCR?

11:43.435 --> 11:45.388
Even I'm too young to use a VCR.

11:45.390 --> 11:48.825
Hey, Pearson Thanksgiving is a
whole thing, all right? You'll see.

11:48.827 --> 11:50.343
- All right.
- Hey, William,

11:50.345 --> 11:52.162
- you know your way around a yam?
- Of course.

11:52.164 --> 11:54.264
- Let me at them yams.
- Thank God.

11:54.266 --> 11:55.365
(groans)

11:55.367 --> 11:56.800
- (coughs)
- Whoa, whoa.

11:56.802 --> 11:58.068
- You okay?
- William: Oh, I'm fine.

11:58.070 --> 11:59.269
Just dying. (laughs)

11:59.271 --> 12:00.482
- You know what?
- (groans)

12:00.492 --> 12:02.072
- On second thought...
- No, I could do it.

12:02.074 --> 12:03.690
I could... today you
are on relaxation duty.

12:03.692 --> 12:04.924
- Randall, I can get the potatoes.
- It's all good.

12:04.926 --> 12:06.601
We will take care of everything.

12:06.611 --> 12:08.361
- You sure?
- I'm positive. It's all good.

12:08.363 --> 12:10.934
- All right.
- Man, I am pumped.

12:10.944 --> 12:14.350
My mom and biological father
eating at the same table?

12:14.352 --> 12:17.003
How great is this?!

12:17.726 --> 12:19.082
- Beth?
- Huh?

12:19.092 --> 12:20.384
Isn't this great?

12:20.394 --> 12:21.825
- Mm-hmm.
- (doorbell rings)

12:21.827 --> 12:25.044
- Okay, let me get that. Be right back.
- Okay.

12:25.046 --> 12:26.258
What's with her?

12:26.268 --> 12:28.098
- I have no idea.
- Huh.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.999
- Hey, guys!
- Hey.

12:30.001 --> 12:32.556
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Oh, Happy Thanksgiving.

12:32.566 --> 12:34.838
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.406
It already smells so good in here.

12:36.408 --> 12:37.845
- It does.
- Oh, these look so good.

12:37.855 --> 12:39.553
You want to put these
in the kitchen for us?

12:39.563 --> 12:41.978
- Absolutely. On my way.
- Good.

12:46.505 --> 12:48.384
I know you've been avoiding my calls.

12:48.386 --> 12:49.619
No, that's silly,

12:49.621 --> 12:51.321
I've just been busy.

12:51.323 --> 12:54.274
Rebecca, I don't know how things work

12:54.276 --> 12:56.126
in your marriage, okay?

12:56.128 --> 12:57.631
I don't know.

12:57.641 --> 13:00.180
But in mine, we don't keep secrets.

13:00.182 --> 13:04.617
And for the past three days,
I've had to hold onto a whopper.

13:05.177 --> 13:08.555
You and William have known each
other for Randall's entire life

13:08.557 --> 13:10.123
and you kept that from him?

13:10.125 --> 13:12.625
I know. I'm gonna tell
him at some point.

13:12.627 --> 13:14.144
No, I need you to tell him today.

13:14.146 --> 13:16.731
I'm not... I'm not telling him today.

13:16.908 --> 13:18.678
Not on Thanksgiving.

13:18.872 --> 13:20.450
Beth...

13:20.452 --> 13:24.554
- I will do it in my own time.
- You have had enough time.

13:24.869 --> 13:28.191
I need you to find the time to do it
before you leave this house tonight...

13:28.193 --> 13:30.376
- or I will.
- Randall: There she is.

13:30.378 --> 13:32.028
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

13:32.030 --> 13:34.881
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving, my love.

13:34.883 --> 13:36.249
(chuckles) Wel... good to see you.

13:36.251 --> 13:37.901
- I'm sorry, I've been cooking.
- No.

13:37.903 --> 13:39.302
Don't want to get anything
on you. I got to go finish.

13:39.304 --> 13:41.754
- Just got to keep going.
- No, no, I'm here to help chop.

13:41.756 --> 13:45.041
Randall: I'll take it off.
Thank you very much.

13:52.017 --> 13:54.133
Well, we spent the last two hours

13:54.135 --> 13:55.785
grocery store hopping, searching

13:55.787 --> 13:58.171
for the perfect cranberry
sauce... which we found.

13:58.173 --> 14:01.884
- So, obviously worth it.
- This sweater's so itchy.

14:01.894 --> 14:04.777
- Get your elbow out of my face!
- You know what? No talking,

14:04.779 --> 14:06.563
just listen to Graceland.

14:06.565 --> 14:09.115
We've already listened to
Graceland like five times.

14:09.117 --> 14:11.698
Yeah. We get it, Dad.
We can call him Al.

14:32.340 --> 14:34.824
51 degrees in New York City.

14:34.826 --> 14:37.377
Rebecca: So, how are things with
the new assistant working out?

14:37.379 --> 14:38.745
Uh, Kelsey?

14:38.747 --> 14:39.779
- Yeah.
- Right?

14:39.781 --> 14:40.911
Uh, not great.

14:40.921 --> 14:44.183
She's been adding little one-liners
to her e-mail signature.

14:44.185 --> 14:48.154
Monday's was, "If the glass
is half-empty, add tequila."

14:48.156 --> 14:49.355
She sounds fun.

14:49.357 --> 14:52.457
Yeah, she sent that to the
president of Chase Bank.

14:52.944 --> 14:54.944
- Hey, sweetheart, um...
- Hmm?

14:54.946 --> 14:58.775
We should find some time
to try and talk today.

14:58.785 --> 15:00.867
- Kevin: Hello, hello.
- That's Kevin and his date.

15:00.877 --> 15:02.602
- Kevin: Girls?
- Let's go say hi. To be continued.

15:02.604 --> 15:04.837
- Annie: Hey, Uncle Kevin.
- Kevin: How are you?

15:04.839 --> 15:06.289
- Good.
- Good to see you, all right.

15:06.291 --> 15:07.440
- Got my keys?
- Yup.

15:07.442 --> 15:08.992
Thank you. Hey, how you doing?

15:08.994 --> 15:10.159
- Mom.
- Hello, sweetheart.

15:10.161 --> 15:12.478
- How are you?
- Happy Thanksgiving.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.163
Kevin: Happy Thanksgiving,
good to see you.

15:14.165 --> 15:15.765
- It's good to see you.
- Miguel: Hey.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.183
- Miguel.
- Kevin.

15:17.185 --> 15:19.185
- Yep.
- How's, uh, the play going?

15:19.187 --> 15:20.820
Having fun at rehearsals?

15:20.822 --> 15:22.722
Fun? (chuckles)

15:23.172 --> 15:25.808
No, Miguel, I'm not having any fun.
It's emotionally brutal work.

15:25.810 --> 15:27.404
- But thank you for asking.
- Kevin.

15:27.414 --> 15:29.696
Okay. Look, uh, this is, oh, Olivia.

15:29.698 --> 15:31.598
- Hi... Hello.
- Kevin: Yeah.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.765
- You're pretty.
- Thank you.

15:34.602 --> 15:36.599
You look like Katy Perry.

15:36.609 --> 15:39.533
Uh, this is Tess and Annie and
you've met my brother, Randall.

15:39.543 --> 15:40.780
The adopted one.

15:40.790 --> 15:42.592
- Yeah.
- (Kevin clears throat)

15:43.506 --> 15:46.129
- Hi, Olivia. I'm Rebecca.
- Hi.

15:46.131 --> 15:48.072
Randall and Kevin's mother.
Really glad you could

15:48.082 --> 15:49.399
join us for Thanksgiving.

15:49.401 --> 15:50.883
Well, thank you so much for having me.

15:50.885 --> 15:53.978
I mean, I hate Thanksgiving, but still.

15:53.988 --> 15:56.539
- You're very welcome.
- Randall: Everyone, uh,

15:56.541 --> 15:57.640
- get our shoes on.
- Good idea.

15:57.642 --> 16:01.237
Time to get our hike on.
Hey, uh, Beth, William, let's go.

16:01.247 --> 16:03.046
Well, we don't do the hike, do we?

16:03.048 --> 16:05.431
Oh, absolutely.
Pearson Family tradition.

16:05.433 --> 16:07.834
You're gonna love it. (laughs)

16:07.836 --> 16:09.852
You're gonna love it.

16:09.854 --> 16:13.829
You're not. You're not gon... You're
gonna, you're gonna tolerate it.

16:13.839 --> 16:16.034
What's exciting, The guy
doing the sets won a Tony.

16:16.044 --> 16:17.658
- Rebecca: Really?
- Kevin: Yeah.

16:17.668 --> 16:19.862
- Rebecca: That is so great.
- Right?

16:19.864 --> 16:23.099
What is the, uh,
the name of the play again?

16:23.101 --> 16:24.801
(scoffs)

16:24.803 --> 16:26.235
What? Are you serious?

16:26.237 --> 16:27.570
- The Back of an Egg.
- Back of an Egg.

16:27.572 --> 16:28.944
Yeah, Mom, I told you like eight times.

16:28.954 --> 16:31.015
I know, I know, I'm sorry. I just, uh...

16:31.025 --> 16:33.326
Grandma and Grandpa,
Tess found a dead bird.

16:33.328 --> 16:35.021
Oh, don't touch it. Here, show me where.

16:35.031 --> 16:36.758
- Come see!
- Okay, come show it to me.

16:36.768 --> 16:40.317
So, your parents, they don't
mind you skipping Thanksgiving?

16:40.643 --> 16:42.852
- No.
- Really?

16:43.660 --> 16:46.425
My mom used to make very
elaborate Thanksgivings.

16:46.435 --> 16:48.825
She'd even make three kinds of pie.

16:48.827 --> 16:52.762
The right kind of pie could save
us from our miserable selves.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.577
Then, inevitably,
Dad's beeper would go off,

16:55.587 --> 16:58.495
and he'd pretend it was the hospital,

16:58.505 --> 17:01.988
even though we all knew he
was banging some nurse.

17:01.990 --> 17:04.089
And Mom would get sad...

17:04.092 --> 17:07.084
and drunk and angry.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.930
You know, the funny thing is,
we had all those pies

17:10.932 --> 17:14.954
and I don't think we ever
once made it to dessert.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.688
It pissed me off 'cause
I really like pie.

17:18.690 --> 17:20.807
No, no. Relax, relax.

17:20.809 --> 17:22.942
- Have a seat.
- All right.

17:22.944 --> 17:24.926
(groans)

17:29.651 --> 17:31.211
You know, I can go get the car.

17:31.221 --> 17:34.352
No, no, no, no, no.
Just give me a minute.

17:34.362 --> 17:35.735
Okay.

17:38.616 --> 17:40.955
Hey, what'd you used to
do for Thanksgiving?

17:40.965 --> 17:43.222
Oh, I'd spend it with my sober friends.

17:43.232 --> 17:45.193
- Cats I met in the meetings.
- Mmm.

17:45.203 --> 17:47.158
A lot of 'em are musicians.

17:47.378 --> 17:48.767
Most of us didn't have family.

17:48.777 --> 17:51.560
None we were on speaking
terms with, anyway.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.835
So we'd have a big potluck.

17:53.845 --> 17:56.563
Everyone would bring their
instruments, and we'd jam all night.

17:56.573 --> 17:58.113
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

17:58.123 --> 18:01.076
Otis Redding, Muddy Waters, you name it.

18:01.086 --> 18:02.717
One of the guys had an old tape player.

18:02.727 --> 18:05.568
He would record us for posterity.

18:06.645 --> 18:10.039
Hmm. I was too sick to
attend last year's, so...

18:10.041 --> 18:12.727
I started a whole new
Thanksgiving tradition.

18:13.484 --> 18:15.373
I'd listen to those tapes,

18:15.383 --> 18:18.214
and eat an entire Marie
Callender's "pee-can" pie.

18:18.216 --> 18:19.415
(both laughing)

18:19.417 --> 18:21.517
Or "puh-kahn" pie.

18:23.506 --> 18:26.963
Oh, man, I wish I would
have packed those tapes.

18:27.562 --> 18:29.075
Oh, well.

18:29.421 --> 18:31.828
(sighs)

18:31.830 --> 18:34.464
How long did you say this hike was?

18:34.466 --> 18:37.917
Exactly 3.4 miles.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.405
Rebecca: Jack, it's gonna get dark soon.

18:43.239 --> 18:45.057
What do we do now?

18:45.059 --> 18:48.277
(exhales)

18:49.726 --> 18:51.083
Now we walk.

18:52.153 --> 18:53.883
- Kate: What?
- Guys.

18:53.885 --> 18:56.106
Come on. It'll be like
a fun little hike.

18:56.116 --> 18:57.443
Mom.

18:57.751 --> 18:59.240
(groaning)

19:05.220 --> 19:06.387
Hey, Randall.

19:06.389 --> 19:08.347
They're finally letting us on the plane,

19:08.357 --> 19:09.858
four hours later.

19:09.860 --> 19:12.327
Um, so I'm gonna miss the movie.

19:12.329 --> 19:14.879
But I should make it in time for dinner.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.998
It's just gonna be me.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.767
I'll explain later.

19:18.769 --> 19:20.391
Okay, bye.

19:34.184 --> 19:36.734
Don't worry, I bought both these seats.

19:37.587 --> 19:39.571
(slight laugh)

19:41.191 --> 19:42.757
Here's your seat belt extender.

19:42.759 --> 19:44.843
- Let's get you strapped in.
- Oh, I-I got it.

19:44.845 --> 19:46.745
- Thank you.
- You welcome.

19:53.078 --> 19:55.677
Pilot: Hi, folks,
this your captain speaking.

19:55.687 --> 19:57.348
We've got a bit of a wait ahead of us,

19:57.358 --> 19:59.976
as we are 12th in line for takeoff.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.477
Rebecca: How are we not there yet?

20:02.479 --> 20:05.118
I feel like we've been walking for days.

20:06.466 --> 20:07.788
Kevin: What was that sound?

20:07.798 --> 20:09.784
Oh, that's probably just
an animal in the woods.

20:09.786 --> 20:11.352
- What?
- Seriously?

20:11.354 --> 20:12.754
There are animals in the woods?

20:12.756 --> 20:14.739
Rebecca: Okay, okay,
guys, I have an idea.

20:14.741 --> 20:18.136
Why don't we play a game?

20:18.559 --> 20:20.678
- Called The Thanksgiving Game?
- Jack: Great idea.

20:20.680 --> 20:24.315
Everyone is going to tell us

20:24.317 --> 20:27.101
what their Thanksgiving is gonna
be like when they grow up.

20:27.103 --> 20:28.598
- Kev, you start.
- Easy.

20:28.608 --> 20:30.305
I'm gonna be a quarterback
for the Steelers.

20:30.307 --> 20:32.073
I'll play a big game on Thanksgiving,

20:32.075 --> 20:33.815
then go home and eat an entire turkey.

20:33.825 --> 20:35.376
All right, you've given
that some real thought.

20:35.378 --> 20:37.111
Rebecca: Randall, what about you,
bud, what are you gonna do?

20:37.113 --> 20:39.163
I'm not gonna celebrate Thanksgiving.

20:39.165 --> 20:40.331
Why not?

20:40.333 --> 20:41.845
When you're a grown up,

20:42.074 --> 20:43.977
you don't have to do stuff you hate.

20:43.987 --> 20:46.004
Kevin: I didn't know no
Thanksgiving was an option.

20:46.006 --> 20:48.369
- I'm not doing it either.
- Me, neither.

20:48.379 --> 20:51.309
- I hate Thanksgiving.
- You guys, come on.

20:51.311 --> 20:54.295
Grandma and Grandpa aren't that bad.

20:55.043 --> 20:57.351
- What?
- It's not just them.

20:57.483 --> 20:58.900
It's you.

21:01.225 --> 21:03.738
You're always mean when
we're at their house and...

21:03.740 --> 21:05.673
you always have this weird...

21:05.675 --> 21:07.158
- and high voice.
- Jack: Okay.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.277
Okay. Don't listen to 'em.

21:09.279 --> 21:10.778
Kids are delusional from the cold.

21:10.780 --> 21:11.996
- Keep walking.
- Randall: The cold?

21:11.998 --> 21:13.905
Zip it, you.

21:14.634 --> 21:17.569
Come on, don't listen to 'em.

21:17.571 --> 21:19.287
Come on.

21:20.075 --> 21:21.519
(door opens)

21:21.529 --> 21:24.434
Okay, everybody get cider,
movie starts in ten.

21:24.444 --> 21:26.945
Okay. Jackets off, girls.

21:31.434 --> 21:34.160
Hey, um, I'm gonna run to
William's apartment real quick.

21:34.170 --> 21:35.005
What

21:35.015 --> 21:36.939
No, I know, I know. But I'll
be back before the movie's over.

21:36.949 --> 21:39.274
- You got to keep an eye on the turkey.
- No. I mean, why are you...?

21:39.276 --> 21:41.845
Look, he's... he's got these
tapes of him and his friends

21:41.855 --> 21:43.427
playing music, and listening to them

21:43.437 --> 21:45.483
is kind of his Thanksgiving thing.

21:45.493 --> 21:47.285
You're gonna drive two hours

21:47.295 --> 21:48.733
- to go pick up some tapes?
- I think...

21:48.735 --> 21:52.620
That's a little extreme. this may
be his last Thanksgiving, Beth.

21:54.137 --> 21:56.489
Yeah, so that's why you need
to get your ass on the road.

21:56.499 --> 21:58.903
- Hurry up.
- Thank you.

21:59.458 --> 22:02.313
- Daddy, is it time to start the movie?
- Yep. You guys

22:02.315 --> 22:04.616
watch it without me. Uh,
Daddy's got to run a quick errand.

22:04.618 --> 22:07.245
Oh, but you, uh,
you love Police Academy III.

22:07.255 --> 22:10.047
I know. That Steve Guttenberg
gets me every time.

22:10.057 --> 22:12.589
Why don't I come with you
and keep you company?

22:12.599 --> 22:15.093
And miss the movie? That's your
favorite Thanksgiving tradition.

22:15.095 --> 22:18.096
No, ma'am. I'll be fine.
Oh, um, Kate got a new flight.

22:18.098 --> 22:19.914
She'll be here just in time for dinner.

22:19.916 --> 22:22.951
She's not bringing the boyfriend.
Sounds like drama.

22:22.953 --> 22:25.197
Don't know what happened.
All right. Bye. See you.

22:25.207 --> 22:26.788
I'll see you soon, William.

22:26.790 --> 22:28.140
(door opens)

22:28.150 --> 22:30.091
- Rebecca: I will go get you some cider.
- (door closes)

22:30.093 --> 22:31.526
Miguel: Thank you, honey.

22:33.893 --> 22:35.095
Hey.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.162
Hey.

22:37.770 --> 22:39.200
So, I, uh...

22:39.967 --> 22:41.102
I know that you and Thanksgiving

22:41.104 --> 22:42.920
have a... somewhat of a spotty past,

22:42.922 --> 22:45.640
but, um... I wanted you to know

22:45.642 --> 22:48.609
that no matter what happens this year,

22:48.611 --> 22:51.012
you're gonna make it to the pie.

22:51.014 --> 22:53.114
(Police Academy music playing)

22:57.259 --> 22:59.087
- Miguel: Hey, Kevin.
- Yeah...

22:59.089 --> 23:00.555
Hey.

23:00.557 --> 23:01.956
Uh...

23:02.284 --> 23:04.409
I was just kind of wondering if...

23:04.411 --> 23:07.315
maybe this year, I could wear the hat?

23:08.698 --> 23:11.283
- Oh, you want to wear the hat?
- Yeah, I do.

23:11.293 --> 23:13.101
Every year we do your
family's traditions,

23:13.103 --> 23:14.982
which is fine. I-I enjoy them.

23:14.992 --> 23:17.555
But I think it would
be nice if just once

23:17.557 --> 23:20.802
I got to wear the hat
for Tess and Annie.

23:21.199 --> 23:22.893
Well, uh, gee.

23:23.580 --> 23:25.263
(grunts) Miguel,
that's not gonna happen.

23:25.265 --> 23:27.914
See, my... my dad wore the hat.

23:28.329 --> 23:30.887
And now Randall and I wear
the hat. We take turns

23:30.897 --> 23:32.286
wearing the hat. This year it's my turn

23:32.288 --> 23:34.301
to wear the hat. So... you know,

23:34.311 --> 23:35.477
no dice.

23:35.487 --> 23:36.708
Okay.

23:40.738 --> 23:43.014
Can you believe that guy? Wants
to wear the hat. I wear the hat

23:43.016 --> 23:45.945
and Randall wears the hat.
That's how we do it.

23:46.209 --> 23:48.352
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.251
Can't do what?

23:54.811 --> 23:57.223
I can't be who you want me to be.

23:57.233 --> 23:59.262
- I should... I should go.
- (door closes)

23:59.272 --> 24:03.183
- What? Hold on. Wait a minute.
- Please, don't try to stop me.

24:03.193 --> 24:06.893
And please stop trying to see
something in me that isn't there.

24:08.459 --> 24:10.028
Olivia...

24:14.526 --> 24:16.792
- Hey, I see something.
- What?

24:16.794 --> 24:18.110
Jack: There it is.

24:18.112 --> 24:19.144
- Randall: Oh, yes!
- Kevin: Oh, yeah!

24:19.146 --> 24:20.412
- Come on.
- Thank you!

24:20.414 --> 24:21.780
Are they gonna get us
a tow truck in there?

24:21.782 --> 24:24.299
Yes, baby, because it's
a Thanksgiving miracle!

24:24.301 --> 24:25.776
- Rebecca: Come on.
- Kate: Yay!

24:25.786 --> 24:27.168
Jack: Come on.

24:27.170 --> 24:30.288
Yeah. I can't get you
a tow truck tonight.

24:31.441 --> 24:32.848
Why not?

24:34.583 --> 24:37.589
Because it's Thanksgiving.
Everything's closed.

24:37.599 --> 24:39.230
If I were you, I'd just
call someone to pick you up

24:39.232 --> 24:41.282
and deal with the car in the morning.

24:41.777 --> 24:44.069
Okay. Why don't you get
the kids some snacks

24:44.079 --> 24:46.855
to tide them over,
and I will go call my parents.

24:47.991 --> 24:51.039
Jack: Go sit in the booth.
Come on. Sit down.

24:52.462 --> 24:54.612
(exhales)

24:58.227 --> 25:01.527
- Could we get... those hot dogs to go?
- (phone rings)

25:01.621 --> 25:04.008
Hi, Mom. It's me.

25:04.440 --> 25:08.793
Yeah, I know what time it is.
I'm sorry. We had a tire blow out.

25:09.782 --> 25:13.782
Yeah. Everybody's okay.
We're fine. We're okay.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.903
I didn't call you sooner because
I couldn't call you sooner.

25:16.913 --> 25:18.859
That's why I'm calling you now.

25:18.869 --> 25:21.089
I know how hard you work
to prepare dinner, Mom.

25:21.091 --> 25:23.675
Do you really think that we
wanted to drive through a fence?

25:23.677 --> 25:26.444
Can you just have Dad come and...

25:26.446 --> 25:27.762
(sighs)

25:30.951 --> 25:32.083
No.

25:32.085 --> 25:34.135
No, no, no, no, no. I am not gonna

25:34.137 --> 25:36.204
subject my kids to that this year.

25:36.206 --> 25:37.605
So...

25:38.458 --> 25:40.208
we're not coming.

25:40.795 --> 25:42.870
We're not coming anymore.

25:43.522 --> 25:45.079
Sorry.

25:46.344 --> 25:48.176
- Hmm.
- Okay.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.102
So, what's the new plan?

25:51.104 --> 25:52.337
(sighs)

25:56.055 --> 25:58.532
Uh, I guess we're having Thanksgiving

25:58.542 --> 26:00.261
at the Pinewood Lodge. Pinewood Lodge.

26:00.263 --> 26:02.397
I love it. I love it.

26:02.969 --> 26:04.983
I love it.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.836
I can't believe I just did that.

26:08.636 --> 26:10.339
- I really did that.
- We'll worry about it later. You did.

26:10.349 --> 26:12.373
Jack: Let's get the kids.

26:16.873 --> 26:19.119
I just came out for some air.

26:19.339 --> 26:21.234
I'm waiting for my Uber.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.536
I don't know what that is.

26:34.165 --> 26:36.218
How does it feel to be dying?

26:46.006 --> 26:48.309
It feels...

26:49.090 --> 26:54.007
like all these beautiful pieces of
life are flying around me and...

26:54.219 --> 26:56.534
I'm trying to catch them.

26:58.875 --> 27:01.039
When my granddaughter
falls asleep in my lap,

27:01.761 --> 27:05.685
I try to catch the feeling
of her breathing against me.

27:05.835 --> 27:08.361
And when I make my son laugh,

27:08.537 --> 27:11.950
I try to catch the
sound of him laughing.

27:11.952 --> 27:14.385
How it rolls up from his chest.

27:18.121 --> 27:22.660
But the pieces are moving faster now,
and I can't catch them all.

27:23.161 --> 27:26.061
I can feel them slipping
through my fingertips.

27:27.263 --> 27:30.041
And soon where there used to
be my granddaughter breathing

27:30.051 --> 27:33.540
and my son laughing, there will be...

27:33.945 --> 27:35.156
nothing.

27:39.015 --> 27:40.363
(quietly): Oh.

27:41.271 --> 27:44.657
I know it feels like you have
all the time in the world.

27:44.904 --> 27:47.068
But you don't.

27:47.444 --> 27:49.779
So, stop playing it so cool.

27:50.052 --> 27:52.386
Catch the moments of your life.

27:52.388 --> 27:55.806
Catch them while you're young and quick.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.642
Because sooner than you
know it, you'll be old.

27:59.351 --> 28:01.044
And slow.

28:01.486 --> 28:04.147
And there'll be no
more of them to catch.

28:06.267 --> 28:10.754
And when a nice boy who
adores you offers you pie,

28:10.756 --> 28:12.352
say thank you.

28:15.127 --> 28:17.127
♪ ♪

28:17.129 --> 28:19.830
(wind whistling)

28:21.684 --> 28:23.700
(pops top)

28:41.624 --> 28:43.487
Thank you for the pie.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.562
(chuckling)

28:53.706 --> 28:55.248
Such a good movie.

28:55.492 --> 28:57.584
By far the best Police Academy.

28:57.586 --> 28:59.653
(tires screeching on TV)

28:59.655 --> 29:02.205
(woman shrieks on TV)

29:05.577 --> 29:08.061
Woman on TV: Go get it!

29:12.702 --> 29:14.071
Hi.

29:14.803 --> 29:16.353
The name's Pilgrim Rick.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.322
I take it you come in search of lodging.

29:20.674 --> 29:23.093
You're doing a bit.
You're doing a bit...

29:23.095 --> 29:24.711
Uh, yeah.

29:24.713 --> 29:26.947
We're... we're in search of lodging.

29:27.598 --> 29:28.899
I needed a warm bed, too,

29:28.901 --> 29:32.102
when I finally made my
way off the Mayflower.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.755
Do you know about the
Mayflower, little kiddies?

29:34.757 --> 29:37.557
Rebecca: Uh, yep. They do know all about

29:37.559 --> 29:39.317
- the Mayflower.
- Uh, we'll just... we'll take

29:39.327 --> 29:40.911
your finest room, Rick.

29:43.358 --> 29:44.681
Pilgrim Rick.

29:46.819 --> 29:49.169
(crickets chirping, owl hooting)

29:51.038 --> 29:52.672
Be careful.

29:54.995 --> 29:56.152
Oh.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.135
(children groaning)

29:58.145 --> 30:00.630
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

30:01.328 --> 30:02.482
Is that real?

30:02.484 --> 30:04.468
No, of course not.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.470
Why is it so hot in here?

30:07.319 --> 30:10.474
Because the furnace is on high.

30:12.500 --> 30:15.256
The furnace is stuck on high, Jack.

30:15.266 --> 30:17.464
Mom, can we take off our
dress clothes, please?

30:17.466 --> 30:19.977
Yes, yes, everybody can strip down.

30:19.987 --> 30:22.335
- Yes.
- Hey, who, uh...

30:22.743 --> 30:25.705
who wants one of the most delicious

30:26.529 --> 30:29.025
gas station hot dogs

30:29.406 --> 30:32.006
in the whole wide
Connecticut woods, huh?

30:34.610 --> 30:36.349
That's cold. Can't eat those.

30:36.351 --> 30:40.088
Or how 'bout instead some, uh,
Kraft Singles? Saltines? Yeah?

30:40.098 --> 30:43.698
Is this really what we're gonna
have for Thanksgiving dinner?

30:44.756 --> 30:46.497
This TV has zero channels.

30:46.507 --> 30:49.057
I should have had my dad come to get us.

30:50.306 --> 30:53.033
Hey, you know what?
Um, get the kids settled.

30:53.035 --> 30:56.241
I'm gonna talk to Pilgrim Rick,
uh, about, uh...

30:56.347 --> 30:59.393
about the furnace.
I'll... I'll be right back.

30:59.701 --> 31:02.350
Guys, really, I can't interest
you in cheese and crackers?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.244
Children: No.

31:13.071 --> 31:14.638
(chuckling)

31:16.441 --> 31:18.124
(humming softly)

31:23.060 --> 31:24.281
Hey.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.758
There we go.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.985
(humming)

31:51.250 --> 31:53.805
(screaming)

31:55.530 --> 31:58.164
(screaming continues)

32:02.103 --> 32:03.636
(screaming)

32:06.591 --> 32:09.932
(anxious chatter)

32:12.522 --> 32:14.035
(intercom dings) Pilot:
Sorry about that folks.

32:14.045 --> 32:16.499
Just some very fast moving cold front.

32:16.501 --> 32:18.534
Nothing to worry about. But please,

32:18.536 --> 32:21.954
remain in your seats with
your seatbelts fastened.

32:21.956 --> 32:23.637
(chuckles) Sorry,

32:23.751 --> 32:26.275
I thought I was gonna die.

32:26.277 --> 32:29.095
(exhales) Me, too.

32:34.004 --> 32:37.236
I almost died married to a man
who's obviously cheating on me.

32:37.238 --> 32:39.555
My kids are out of the house now.

32:39.557 --> 32:42.458
I have no reason to
stay with him anymore.

32:45.222 --> 32:47.263
I'm gonna get a divorce.

32:48.754 --> 32:50.578
Life's too short.

32:57.953 --> 32:59.842
(knocking)

33:00.463 --> 33:01.749
Oh, that must be your dad.

33:01.759 --> 33:03.896
Kate: Dad has a key.

33:04.022 --> 33:05.511
Uh,

33:05.698 --> 33:07.896
- who is it?
- It's Pilgrim Rick!

33:08.117 --> 33:09.200
Um,

33:09.210 --> 33:10.701
Pilgrim Rick, we're...

33:10.703 --> 33:12.709
- We're okay, actually.
- I'm here to fix the furnace!

33:12.719 --> 33:14.242
Yeah, we're fine, Pilgrim Rick.

33:14.252 --> 33:16.090
- I'm coming in!
- (doorknob rattling)

33:16.092 --> 33:17.591
(gasping)

33:17.593 --> 33:18.709
Jack!

33:18.719 --> 33:21.478
(laughing)

33:21.480 --> 33:23.900
There's no Jack here, it's Pilgrim Rick.

33:23.910 --> 33:24.844
(Kate laughing)

33:24.854 --> 33:26.483
Do you kiddies know about the Mayflower?

33:26.485 --> 33:28.919
- (laughing)
- Huh? Huh?

33:28.929 --> 33:31.792
What if I told you a
little Thanksgiving story?

33:32.391 --> 33:33.724
How about a kiss for an old Pilgrim?

33:33.726 --> 33:34.975
- No... (shrieking)
- No, no,

33:34.977 --> 33:36.327
no, no, no, mmm...

33:36.329 --> 33:37.962
Mwah!

33:37.964 --> 33:39.500
(all laughing)

33:39.510 --> 33:42.152
Tonight, on the itinerary...

33:42.162 --> 33:44.435
of the Pinewood Lodge,

33:44.437 --> 33:46.503
a movie...

33:47.870 --> 33:49.728
and an indoor picnic.

33:49.738 --> 33:51.442
Kate: Yes!

33:52.085 --> 33:53.911
- Ooh.
- (laughing)

33:53.913 --> 33:55.296
Get the pillows!

33:55.298 --> 33:57.075
I found it in the office.

33:57.085 --> 33:58.417
- Police Academy III?
- Yeah.

33:58.419 --> 33:59.836
You sure that's appropriate?

33:59.838 --> 34:01.120
Ah, it was either that or 9 1/2 Weeks.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.138
- (gasps)
- So...

34:02.140 --> 34:05.124
- Police Academy III, guys! Yeah.
- So,

34:05.126 --> 34:07.322
we are going to...

34:07.332 --> 34:10.784
skewer our hotdogs

34:11.625 --> 34:13.149
and then...

34:13.150 --> 34:14.967
we're gonna roast 'em...

34:18.904 --> 34:20.556
on an open furnace flame.

34:20.558 --> 34:23.042
And then once they get
all toasty and warm,

34:23.043 --> 34:24.877
we're gonna wrap it in cheese

34:24.879 --> 34:27.780
and then roll it in crushed up crackers.

34:27.782 --> 34:29.982
Thanksgiving cheese dogs.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.918
- Cool.
- Get a stick, come on.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.753
- All right, go.
- Yes!

34:33.755 --> 34:36.121
- I want a stick.
- Here you go, Pilgrim Rick.

34:36.123 --> 34:37.873
(chuckling) Thanks, buddy.

34:43.944 --> 34:45.614
Okay, who's up first?

34:45.617 --> 34:46.931
Me.

34:49.786 --> 34:52.138
And that's the kind
of dog you guys want?

34:52.139 --> 34:54.574
Oh, come on, guys.

34:54.576 --> 34:56.391
Somebody call for Pilgrim Rick?

34:56.393 --> 34:58.494
I'm sorry I'm late but,
uh, I had to make

34:58.496 --> 35:00.451
a little pit stop at the Mayflower.
Turns out Pilgrim Rick is

35:00.461 --> 35:02.531
lactose intolerant. Well, anyway,

35:02.533 --> 35:03.833
I'm here now and I'm looking for

35:03.835 --> 35:06.734
a couple of young little pilgrims...

35:06.839 --> 35:09.932
to... help me out with the, uh...

35:13.990 --> 35:16.909
uh, well the truth is, I am...
I'm actually not Pilgrim Rick.

35:16.919 --> 35:19.548
I'm Pilgrim Kevin. Uncle Kevin, really.

35:19.550 --> 35:21.200
Um...

35:21.202 --> 35:22.518
probably hard for you to tell, though.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.505
My acting has become so stellar,
all this stage acting.

35:26.507 --> 35:30.119
Um, don't be sad though,
the-the real Pilgrim Rick is...

35:30.534 --> 35:32.551
Is right behind you.

35:35.263 --> 35:36.359
Come on.

35:36.369 --> 35:37.867
Uh, are you sure?

35:40.421 --> 35:41.404
Have fun.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.339
- Pilgrim Rick!
- Yay!

35:43.341 --> 35:45.424
It's me, Pilgrim Rick!

35:45.426 --> 35:48.705
- (door opens)
- You kiddies know about the Mayflower?

35:48.715 --> 35:51.809
Let Pilgrim Rick tell you
a Thanksgiving story.

35:51.819 --> 35:53.424
In 1620...

35:53.434 --> 35:54.600
Find what you needed?

35:54.602 --> 35:56.419
- Yeah.
- All right.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.387
Good. Uh, where's Kate?

36:00.318 --> 36:02.308
She, uh...

36:02.310 --> 36:05.077
texted, she'll... She'll be here soon.

36:05.079 --> 36:06.579
Okay.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.230
Everybody's starving,
you want to get started?

36:08.232 --> 36:09.625
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.550
Hey, Pilgrim Rick. Can you
lead us into the dining room?

36:11.552 --> 36:14.103
- It's time for dinner.
- Miguel: Absolutely.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.838
Everybody, let's go put on a feast.

36:15.848 --> 36:17.556
(Beth laughing)

36:24.811 --> 36:26.961
What else can I help with?

36:27.350 --> 36:29.083
(speaks quietly) Okay.

36:31.209 --> 36:32.548
All right.

36:58.281 --> 36:59.397
Thank you.

37:01.334 --> 37:03.317
(theme music playing)

37:03.319 --> 37:05.521
This is probably the
greatest movie ever made.

37:05.531 --> 37:08.697
- Yeah?
- This sweater's so itchy.

37:08.707 --> 37:11.209
Here, let me have it.

37:14.647 --> 37:16.314
I have, uh...

37:16.316 --> 37:18.781
I have an idea for one more
Thanksgiving tradition

37:18.791 --> 37:21.202
before we go to bed. Come here.

37:21.204 --> 37:22.570
What is it?

37:22.572 --> 37:24.338
So we're all gonna go around

37:24.340 --> 37:25.876
and say what we're thankful for.

37:25.886 --> 37:28.159
And then whoever's turn it is,

37:28.161 --> 37:30.111
is going to pull on this yarn

37:30.113 --> 37:32.513
and then throw it to the next person.

37:32.523 --> 37:34.899
(laughing)

37:34.901 --> 37:36.517
Okay.

37:36.775 --> 37:39.172
I am thankful...

37:39.182 --> 37:40.775
for my family.

37:41.875 --> 37:45.860
I'm thankful that we're all safe.

37:45.862 --> 37:47.587
And...

37:47.597 --> 37:50.064
there's no one in the world

37:50.066 --> 37:52.430
I'd rather be too hot

37:52.440 --> 37:53.951
or too cold with.

37:59.108 --> 38:01.659
I am thankful for my family.

38:02.461 --> 38:05.129
I am thankful that everyone's safe.

38:05.969 --> 38:09.625
And there is no one in the whole world

38:09.635 --> 38:11.702
I'd rather be too hot

38:11.704 --> 38:13.654
or too cold with.

38:14.398 --> 38:16.446
Grandma always says the same thing.

38:16.534 --> 38:17.652
(chuckling)

38:17.662 --> 38:19.810
Yeah, she does, doesn't she?

38:29.851 --> 38:31.780
Is everything all right, baby?

38:34.960 --> 38:37.060
Um... you girls should
go upstairs and play

38:37.070 --> 38:38.446
in Tess's room for a little while.

38:38.448 --> 38:40.214
- But...
- Come on.

38:55.850 --> 38:57.868
Why is there a photo of me

38:57.878 --> 39:00.835
and a letter that you sent
to William's apartment?

39:12.215 --> 39:14.198
(exhales slowly)

39:15.668 --> 39:16.801
- Randall...
- No, you know what?

39:16.803 --> 39:20.288
Don't... don't speak.
Please, don't just... um...

39:20.290 --> 39:21.689
I went to William's apartment

39:21.691 --> 39:24.058
to get his old Thanksgiving tapes.

39:24.520 --> 39:28.009
I was about to go and
I saw this envelope.

39:28.432 --> 39:29.692
I said,

39:31.036 --> 39:32.700
I know that handwriting.

39:32.702 --> 39:35.136
That's my mother's handwriting,
but how-how could that be?

39:35.138 --> 39:36.921
That... it doesn't make sense, right?

39:36.923 --> 39:39.422
- (paper rustling)
- So...

39:40.743 --> 39:42.143
I, uh...

39:43.042 --> 39:44.679
"Dear William,

39:45.165 --> 39:47.481
I'm sorry I had to
leave in such a hurry.

39:48.061 --> 39:51.073
But it was wonderful to
see you looking so well

39:51.083 --> 39:54.355
after all these years."

39:57.293 --> 40:00.567
- After all these years.
- (sighs)

40:04.491 --> 40:06.050
Randall, you have to understand...

40:06.060 --> 40:09.557
Understand what?
That you knew my father?

40:13.246 --> 40:17.028
That you kept him from
me my entire life?

40:19.098 --> 40:21.585
- Everything that I...
- Just stop... Just stop!

40:21.595 --> 40:23.934
Please, stop.

40:26.489 --> 40:29.150
I can't... I can't even look at you.

40:30.326 --> 40:32.293
(sniffles)

40:32.689 --> 40:36.877
And all the times I asked
you about my family.

40:36.887 --> 40:39.637
And if I hadn't found
him on my own, I'd....

40:43.382 --> 40:45.239
- I got to go.
- Beth: Wait.

40:45.241 --> 40:46.726
(sniffles)

40:48.312 --> 40:49.710
Just wait a second, honey.

40:49.712 --> 40:51.315
- Please, babe.
- I just gotta get some time alone.

40:51.325 --> 40:53.230
- Excuse me.
- Hey...

40:53.232 --> 40:56.033
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late.

40:56.448 --> 40:58.235
I have an announcement.

40:58.470 --> 41:01.492
I've decided to have
gastric bypass surgery.

41:07.028 --> 41:08.963
Your family is amazing.

41:14.508 --> 41:15.553
Randall: Mom?

41:15.988 --> 41:17.972
Yeah, baby.

41:17.974 --> 41:20.341
I changed my mind.

41:20.343 --> 41:23.444
I want to have Thanksgiving
when I grow up.

41:23.446 --> 41:24.528
You do?

41:24.530 --> 41:25.898
Yeah.

41:27.216 --> 41:29.300
I know how I want it to be.

41:29.669 --> 41:30.832
How?

41:31.554 --> 41:33.154
Like tonight.

41:33.156 --> 41:35.289
I want every Thanksgiving

41:35.291 --> 41:38.665
to be like this for the rest of my life.

41:42.236 --> 41:43.464
Mm.
