<i>Ever since I was three,</i>

00:39.800 --> 00:41.962
<i>I wanted to play quarterback
for the New York Giants...</i>

00:42.160 --> 00:44.766
<i>like my personal hero,
Eli Manning.</i>

00:44.920 --> 00:48.811
<i>Annual salary is between 10
and 20 million dollars a year.</i>

00:49.080 --> 00:50.445
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:51.640 --> 00:53.529
Next up... Reed.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.161
Mr. Richards?

00:58.640 --> 01:00.449
Earth to Richards.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.682
Beam me up, Scotty.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.888
- Okay, come on, guys.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.604
When I grow up...

01:13.800 --> 01:15.211
I want to be the first person
in human history

01:15.320 --> 01:16.560
to teleport himself.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.444
I'm sorry, what?

01:23.120 --> 01:24.610
It's already possible to transport

01:24.680 --> 01:26.808
quantum information
from one location to another.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.080
Right now,
there are supercomputers

01:29.160 --> 01:30.241
that can transport

01:30.360 --> 01:32.169
Quantum information
through space.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.886
So why not a machine that can
send people through space?

01:35.320 --> 01:38.403
Well, even if you could build
the thing, which you can't...

01:38.560 --> 01:40.210
I've already built it.

01:40.640 --> 01:41.801
Well, I'm building it.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.041
In my garage.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.208
Is it next to
your flying car?

01:46.520 --> 01:48.204
I'm not working
on that anymore.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.521
Just this now.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.961
I call it a "Biomatter Shuttle."

01:52.040 --> 01:53.201
"Biomatter..."?

01:53.360 --> 01:55.886
Technically, I'm shuttling matter
from one place to another.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.405
Well, first matter.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.050
But once I test
on biological

01:59.160 --> 02:00.207
materials, I can...
All right, look...

02:00.520 --> 02:01.726
Thank you, Mr. Richards.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.490
This is all very interesting

02:03.680 --> 02:06.411
but the assignment
was to pick a real career

02:06.560 --> 02:07.721
in the real world.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.850
Redo the report, and I'll
let you try again tomorrow.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.241
Ben?

02:54.080 --> 02:55.491
Anyway, I tell him...

02:55.640 --> 02:58.120
"Bro, I ain't looking
at your girl.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.611
"Girl's looking at me.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.080
"What you want me
to do about it?"

03:01.120 --> 03:02.804
Know what I'm saying?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.165
Hey, where you going?

03:05.280 --> 03:07.123
I got homework.
What?

03:07.440 --> 03:08.930
Look at that fridge pile.

03:09.760 --> 03:10.807
Idiot.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.441
What'd you say?

03:17.440 --> 03:19.204
Hey! Clobbering time.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.441
What'd you think?

03:20.560 --> 03:21.686
Think you can
talk to me like that, huh?

03:21.800 --> 03:23.245
You think you can
talk to me like that, punk?

03:23.400 --> 03:25.400
What the hell
is the matter with you?

03:25.440 --> 03:27.488
Shh! Huh? Huh?
Ma!

03:27.800 --> 03:29.086
I didn't do nothing!
Huh? Huh?

03:29.240 --> 03:31.049
Ma, I swear to God!
You didn't do nothing?

03:31.120 --> 03:32.360
Go check on that fuss.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.130
You didn't do nothing?
I watched you!

03:34.280 --> 03:35.361
What's the matter with you?

03:35.520 --> 03:37.887
How many times do I have to tell you,
you don't hit a kid!

03:45.760 --> 03:47.489
Hey!

03:52.000 --> 03:53.126
Hello?

03:56.160 --> 03:57.685
Who's in there?

04:00.120 --> 04:01.326
Please don't kill me.

04:01.960 --> 04:02.961
Take that off.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.008
I know you. From school.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.722
I'm just looking
for a power converter.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.161
I'm building something.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.079
Ben!
What's going on out there?

04:17.120 --> 04:18.360
Hold on!

04:19.880 --> 04:21.404
That teleporting thing?

04:21.680 --> 04:24.968
I can show it to you.
I just need the converter.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.681
All right.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.888
Come on,
throw him the ball!

04:35.360 --> 04:36.646
Throw
the ball, throw the ball!

04:37.920 --> 04:39.280
Come on, he's open!
Throw the ball!

04:51.720 --> 04:54.690
That's what
I'm talking about. Yeah!

05:01.040 --> 05:02.041
Is that it?
Yeah.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
Help.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.411
Here you go.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.287
Your family owns a junkyard?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.526
Mmm-hmm.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.045
That place is awesome.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.922
Here.
You're stripping the head.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.086
So, uh, who else lives here?

05:32.240 --> 05:33.730
Just my mom and step-dad.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.200
They don't care about all this?

05:35.240 --> 05:36.890
They don't understand it.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.285
You might want to
cover your ears.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.569
Stand back a little.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.281
What the hell?

06:04.600 --> 06:05.806
Damn it.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.241
It's all right.
All right, come on.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.005
Don't blow up.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.527
Don't blow up.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.444
Come on, man! Guy's open!

06:22.640 --> 06:24.085
Whoa!

06:24.160 --> 06:26.162
Reed! What did you do?

06:35.160 --> 06:36.161
Now!

06:50.720 --> 06:51.960
Reed!

06:52.320 --> 06:53.446
Did it work?

06:54.520 --> 06:55.880
Hey, Reed!

07:02.320 --> 07:03.970
Where'd the rocks come from?

07:05.800 --> 07:07.882
From the same place
the car went to.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.361
Where is that?

07:12.040 --> 07:13.530
I don't know yet.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.241
Reed?

07:15.800 --> 07:17.040
What?

07:17.360 --> 07:18.725
You're insane.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.406
Thanks.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.890
Mr. Richards.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.441
Shall I alert
the fire department?

07:35.800 --> 07:36.881
What is this?

07:37.720 --> 07:40.041
Uh, this is a
Cymatic Matter Shuttle.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.281
Me and my associate Ben

07:41.360 --> 07:43.010
have been working on it
every day since 5th grade

07:43.080 --> 07:45.208
when we launched the beta
version in my garage.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.209
And today is our first
public demonstration.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.401
What does it do?

07:48.560 --> 07:49.971
It modulates
the frequency of matter

07:50.040 --> 07:52.441
from one location
to another and back again.

07:55.880 --> 07:56.927
It's a teleporter.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.081
A teleporter.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.685
Model car, please?

08:01.600 --> 08:02.965
The model...
The model car, please, Ben.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.411
I don't have the model car.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.840
Why don't you have
the model car?

08:05.920 --> 08:07.410
I brought everything else.
I specifically...

08:07.560 --> 08:08.560
But... Mr. Richards?

08:08.600 --> 08:10.250
Okay, I will use
this model plane.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.285
Hey, I just need to
use this for one second.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.000
But I'll give it back,
I promise. Thanks.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.765
Here we go.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.482
Ben? Please?

08:25.760 --> 08:27.205
You may want to
cover your ears.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.730
Great. Now, Ben,
bring it on back.

08:42.799 --> 08:43.961
Yeah.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.161
Oh, keep 'em covered.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.487
Oh, come on.
No. Come on, come on.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.726
Don't do this.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.084
Oh, okay.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.322
Now if I can have
your attention, please.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.040
What you're looking at is sand,

09:02.120 --> 09:04.566
presumably from
the Gansu Desert in China.

09:04.640 --> 09:05.641
Or perhaps even from the Sahara.

09:05.760 --> 09:06.761
You're disqualified.

09:06.840 --> 09:07.887
We're not entirely sure
where it's from...

09:07.960 --> 09:09.530
Mr. Richards,
you're disqualified.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.200
Wait, what?

09:11.320 --> 09:13.322
This is a science fair,
not a magic competition.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.209
I don't see
any real science here.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.283
And you're paying
for the backboard.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.131
Did you put it on 6 or 8?

09:25.240 --> 09:26.526
Everything was the same.

09:26.680 --> 09:27.681
I know,
but you're smashing the buttons.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.325
It's delicate.
You can't smash it.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.801
Hey, kid, I'm really
sorry about your plane.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.246
You're a dick.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.600
You cranked it up too high.

09:35.640 --> 09:36.607
I didn't crank it up
too high.

09:36.720 --> 09:37.801
It was on the same
setting as last time.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.245
I know,
but it's very precise.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.322
Excuse me, guys?
Just pack it up.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.440
Yeah?

09:42.480 --> 09:45.484
Did you really build this
in your garage?

09:46.680 --> 09:47.681
Mmm-hmm.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.691
Now,
this is elegant.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.721
What are these?

09:58.480 --> 09:59.480
Uh, Sonic projectors,

09:59.520 --> 10:01.522
using cymatics
to modulate the field.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.525
That's why we can't
bring the matter back

10:04.640 --> 10:06.005
from the other dimension.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.370
Uh... What?

10:09.200 --> 10:11.202
We've gone so far as to send
matter to another dimension

10:11.360 --> 10:12.885
but we haven't been able
to maintain a field

10:13.000 --> 10:14.684
long enough
to bring that matter back.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.845
You just did.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.601
Oh, you're serious.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.604
I think you've cracked
inter-dimensional travel.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.841
I mean, we're not sending
anything to another dimension.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.967
We sent something,
we think,

10:34.040 --> 10:35.160
to another part
of the planet

10:35.200 --> 10:37.441
but I don't know about
another dimension.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.285
We found the same
thing you did.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.361
We've had it
analyzed repeatedly,

10:43.440 --> 10:45.568
but no one's ever
seen anything like it.

10:45.720 --> 10:46.721
Oh, wow.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.369
I'm sorry. We're from
the Baxter Foundation.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.045
This is my daughter, Sue.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.682
Hi.
Hi.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.451
We'd like to
give you a full scholarship.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.009
Uh, where did you say
you were from again?

11:11.440 --> 11:14.410
Hey. You could fit the whole
neighborhood in there.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.880
What's your name?

11:25.920 --> 11:27.046
Uh, Reed.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.241
Richards.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.924
Yes, of course.
We've been expecting you.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.122
They actually
wear lab coats here.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.251
This is you, sir.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.641
Here.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.160
What?

12:13.480 --> 12:15.482
What is this?
It's a going-away present.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.726
I'm not going away.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.365
I'm, like, a 40-minute
train ride from Oyster Bay.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.364
Reed, look at this place.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.601
You belong here.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.720
I've been here two minutes
and I already know that.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.687
I'm just going to school here.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.165
It's where
I'm gonna be working.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.049
It looks like
you're home, buddy.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.041
Hey.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.326
This place is pretty incredible.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.323
They have molecular chem
books from the 1950s.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.243
Oh, hey. Sorry,
did you say something?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.447
Yeah, I was just asking,
what are you listening to?

13:36.840 --> 13:38.251
Portishead.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.447
Never heard of him.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.886
"Them."

13:42.600 --> 13:44.250
I'll have to check them out.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.641
I love this book.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.922
It's about this guy,
Captain Nemo.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.241
He invents a submarine
that goes deeper

13:54.360 --> 13:55.361
than anything in history.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.448
Yeah, I know. I've read it.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.763
So, you like music?

14:01.920 --> 14:04.287
Is that kind of
like your thing?

14:04.960 --> 14:07.042
Pattern recognition.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.571
Pattern recognition?

14:09.480 --> 14:12.245
Music is just a series
of altered patterns.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.561
The musician creates the pattern

14:13.640 --> 14:16.120
and makes us
anticipate a resolution...

14:16.280 --> 14:18.806
...then holds back.
Makes you wait for it.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.251
There's patterns in
everything and everyone.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.446
Hmm.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.607
What's mine?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.404
You wanna be famous.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.607
Your parents, teachers

14:27.760 --> 14:29.091
all told you one thing,
one way to be,

14:29.240 --> 14:30.810
and you ignored them.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.325
And now I'm here.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.805
So you are.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.286
Am I that predictable?

14:42.240 --> 14:43.480
Everybody is.

14:43.920 --> 14:44.967
Well, you're wrong.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.690
I don't wanna be famous.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.600
I just want my work
to make a difference.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.968
Well, here you are,
Captain Nemo.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.685
Go for it.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.121
Bye.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.044
<i>Let me guess.
Some kid from the Internet.</i>

15:02.200 --> 15:03.486
<i>Science fair.</i>

15:03.640 --> 15:05.290
Franklin,
this board has invested

15:05.360 --> 15:07.044
a great deal
in your little orphanage.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.483
We need real world applications.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.563
This has real world
applications.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.808
I truly believe
that there is an entire...

15:13.960 --> 15:14.927
"An entirely new universe,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.128
"just beyond
our ability to see."

15:17.280 --> 15:18.520
Yes, I've read your paper.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.125
Once we get there...
If we get there.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.408
...we'll be able to
discover new resources.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.166
Energy sources which
will revitalize our own.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.005
This is our chance
to learn more

15:27.120 --> 15:28.963
about our planet
and maybe even save it.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.687
And I'm sure you all would
agree that even if...

15:31.840 --> 15:35.686
Wait. What is this?
Victor Von Doom is on here.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.046
He started this project

15:37.160 --> 15:39.083
and devoted
a decade of his life to it.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.049
He deserves to be in jail.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.043
He deserves another chance.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.521
He set fire to your
data servers before he left.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.971
I'm going to personally
supervise him.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.371
I need his talent.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.251
I believe he and Reed
can finally get us there.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.200
We want to support you,
Franklin,

15:55.240 --> 15:56.844
but you put a lot
of faith in these kids.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.528
I put all my faith in them.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.084
So someone stole my design.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.242
No one stole anything, Victor.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.722
Someone else
figured out your idea...

16:37.960 --> 16:39.564
and made it work.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.925
That's what happens when
you drop out of the world.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.764
Other people finish
what you started.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.041
Well, if you came
to ask for help,

16:54.120 --> 16:55.406
be better you didn't
insult both of us...

16:55.560 --> 16:56.766
and turn back around.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.964
Don't you wanna even
look at the designs?

17:00.160 --> 17:03.004
I told you I'm done working
for you and your employers.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.010
They're not my employers.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.685
You can't do a thing
without their permission, yes?

17:07.880 --> 17:10.611
Wake up. You're an employee.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.848
They'll stay out of my way
this time. Trust me.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.560
It's not you I don't trust.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.807
Yeah.

17:18.560 --> 17:19.685
Well...

17:21.280 --> 17:24.522
I hate to interfere with
all of your important work.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.087
Guess we'll just have
to make history without you.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.128
Is Sue gonna be there?

17:35.960 --> 17:37.485
I trust her.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.689
Yes, Victor, she'll be there.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.603
Clean yourself up, son.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.565
Holy shit.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.520
Amazing.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.520
Oh, thanks.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.680
Amazing you didn't black out
the entire Western Hemisphere.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.167
Hmm?

18:32.240 --> 18:34.402
You basically ripped a hole
in the fabric of space-time

18:34.560 --> 18:37.211
with unspec'd components
and no supervision.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.362
Yeah, that was, uh,
an accident.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.806
And if, by accident,
you upped the power...

18:40.960 --> 18:42.200
you would have created
a runaway reaction

18:42.280 --> 18:43.406
that opened a black hole...

18:43.600 --> 18:45.250
and swallowed the entire planet.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.370
Well, I'm glad
that didn't happen.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.763
Are you helping on this?

18:53.560 --> 18:55.403
I'm making
the environment suits.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.123
Based on the soil samples
from our experiments...

18:58.320 --> 18:59.560
anyone who goes
to the other dimension

18:59.640 --> 19:00.926
is gonna need
to be protected.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.641
Who's that?

19:06.560 --> 19:08.562
Victor.
Who's Victor?

19:08.720 --> 19:10.404
He started this whole project.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.730
Oh. Does he go here, too?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.324
It's complicated.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.607
Rudimentary.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.127
Elementary.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.247
This is basically
a child's drawing.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.402
You know what
Albert Einstein said.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.250
"If you can't explain it simply,

19:32.320 --> 19:33.970
"you don't understand it
well enough."

19:34.120 --> 19:35.804
Ten years searching
for something

19:35.960 --> 19:39.123
that is basically runner-up
for a baking soda volcano.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.844
We were actually disqualified.
The potato clock got second.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.124
Reed Richards,
Victor Von Doom.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.362
Victor started
the Quantum Gate project

19:48.440 --> 19:50.124
when he was
younger than you.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.280
Wow. It's great
to meet you.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.841
Hi, Susan.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.041
Hey, Victor.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.970
Do you prefer "Susan"?
No.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.120
It's been a while.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.366
Didn't expect to
see you back here.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.284
Yeah, well,
I couldn't resist.

20:04.720 --> 20:05.767
When I heard about the design,

20:05.840 --> 20:07.842
I needed to see it
with my own eyes.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.081
I gotta say,
it's pretty impressive...

20:09.160 --> 20:10.286
Thank you.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.329
...that you nearly destroyed
our entire planet

20:12.480 --> 20:14.562
with speaker cable
and aluminum foil.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.201
Yeah, that was an accident.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.486
He did get it to work.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.724
What is this?

20:21.880 --> 20:24.645
This is where your little,
uh, accident leads to.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.327
We put a camera on
a drone we sent over there.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.006
The drone didn't come back,
but those images did.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.481
Wow. It's beautiful.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.165
Yes, it is.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.481
New energy, resources.
It's a whole new world.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.924
Which can help save this one.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.924
Not that it deserves
to be saved.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.241
I mean, think about it.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.520
The people running the Earth

20:46.560 --> 20:47.846
are the same ones
running it into the ground.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.920
So, maybe it deserves
what it's got coming to it.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.405
Dr. Doom, over here.

20:52.680 --> 20:53.920
The failures of my generation

20:54.000 --> 20:57.163
are the opportunities for yours.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.250
There are no greater minds
than the ones in this room.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.169
Is he gonna give a speech?
He's gonna give a speech.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.523
But you're gonna have to
all come together.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.201
Each of you working together

21:07.280 --> 21:09.408
with a level of commitment
and collaboration...

21:09.560 --> 21:11.210
putting aside petty squabbles...

21:11.360 --> 21:13.840
if you want to fix
what my generation broke.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.569
If you can do that,
work together...

21:17.720 --> 21:20.929
then you can change
the course of history.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.684
That's a pretty good speech.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.891
I'm in.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.565
Me, too.
I'm here, right?

21:29.360 --> 21:31.044
First, design.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.248
We figure out what went wrong
and correct it.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.926
Then we build, then we send
organic matter over there.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.526
But, more importantly,
we bring it back.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.886
And then...

21:40.040 --> 21:43.328
most importantly,
they send us.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.401
"Us"?

21:46.920 --> 21:47.921
Us, us?

21:49.800 --> 21:50.926
We're going over there?

21:51.120 --> 21:53.088
Not unless you get to work.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.405
So, get to work.

22:11.680 --> 22:12.966
Johnny Storm.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.360
So that's the
piece of shit Toyota

22:14.440 --> 22:15.646
you been talking about.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.606
Why, yes, it is.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.250
Now you promise me
we'll still be cool

22:19.320 --> 22:21.607
after I dust your ass.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.610
No. Come on.

22:58.800 --> 22:59.801
Rookie!

23:13.640 --> 23:15.005
Bye-bye.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.081
Oh, shit.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.810
I cannot
believe you're out here

23:33.880 --> 23:35.609
doing this nonsense again.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.605
I told you.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.321
What?

23:39.520 --> 23:42.364
I told you I was doing 45
when I spun out.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.760
Yeah.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.241
The ground was wet
and I hydroplaned.

23:46.440 --> 23:50.001
Funny, I don't seem to
remember any rain today.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.003
You were probably
too busy to notice.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.761
Johnny, I thought you were
turning things around.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.724
What is this?
What are you talking about?

24:03.920 --> 24:05.365
This! This!

24:05.520 --> 24:08.410
Is this the way you want
the rest of your life to be?

24:08.560 --> 24:09.686
You keep acting out.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.531
You have the potential and
the IQ to do so much more.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.404
Oh, you mean like Sue?

24:14.560 --> 24:16.130
I know you think you know
what's best for you,

24:16.200 --> 24:17.690
but trust me, son,
you do not.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.728
Can you stop that?
What? Stop what?

24:19.880 --> 24:21.800
Stop talking to me
like I'm one of your students.

24:24.440 --> 24:25.726
Well, you're not
getting the car back.

24:25.880 --> 24:26.881
Excuse me?

24:26.960 --> 24:28.121
You're not getting
the car back.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.531
I built that thing
from scratch

24:29.600 --> 24:30.761
with my own two hands.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.889
With my money.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.562
My money, my car.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.966
You want it back,
you're gonna have to earn it.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.640
You're gonna have to
come work for me.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.245
I'm not wearing a lab coat.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.004
Appreciate your work, miss.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.289
Oh, you gotta
untuck that shirt, man.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.805
Is that Adolf? Long time.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.604
Still not German.
And we don't need any more help.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.251
Yes, you do.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.010
With what,
his boundless enthusiasm?

25:09.120 --> 25:10.200
Oh, why, thank you, Victor.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.481
He can build anything.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.687
With a broken arm?

25:12.840 --> 25:14.604
What exactly happened?
What?

25:14.680 --> 25:15.681
Were you racing again?

25:15.840 --> 25:16.841
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:16.920 --> 25:19.321
I could use some help, actually.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.289
Oh, this guy
doesn't take orders well.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.283
Yeah, especially from
people who say shit like,

25:23.360 --> 25:24.771
"I don't take orders well."

25:27.280 --> 25:28.406
What you need, buddy?

25:28.520 --> 25:29.601
Oh, that's brilliant.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.841
Hey.
What's up? Johnny.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.167
Reed. Nice to meet you.
Have you welded before?

25:33.280 --> 25:34.281
Of course.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.764
Keeps overheating.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.481
Hey.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.161
What's up?

26:50.920 --> 26:52.684
I got to say,
it's fun having you here.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.965
Mmm-hmm.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.884
You kind of look like
you're in your element.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.963
Look, don't get used to this.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.043
I'm just here
to get my car back.

27:04.880 --> 27:05.961
Right.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.482
It's good seeing you too.

28:00.760 --> 28:01.761
Sorry.
Oh, whoa!

28:01.840 --> 28:03.080
Oh, my God.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.320
Why would you do that?
Sorry.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.488
I freaked out.
Oh, my gosh. Sorry.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.210
You were sort of sleeping.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.442
Was I? Is that what that was?

28:11.600 --> 28:13.762
It's okay if you need to
take a nap or something.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.644
I'm good, thanks.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.361
Uh, so, that must
have been cool

28:19.440 --> 28:20.965
with Dr. Storm as your dad.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.167
Yeah.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.361
Did he adopt you?

28:23.440 --> 28:24.441
Mmm-hmm.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.240
Yeah, I know what that's like.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.121
You were adopted?

28:29.520 --> 28:31.284
No, I just wish that I was.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.486
Why?

28:32.640 --> 28:35.530
I don't know. We don't
really understand each other.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.926
Mmm.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.126
Where were you born?

28:38.320 --> 28:40.800
Kosovo.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.130
You don't have an accent.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.680
I don't?

29:12.520 --> 29:14.204
Hey, Reed. Can I have a word?

29:14.840 --> 29:16.046
Okay, yeah.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.201
Hey.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.249
You're being unprofessional.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.528
You're supposed to be
down here, working.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.291
Yeah, I am. That's
what we've been doing.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.563
That's not what it looks like.

29:38.720 --> 29:40.370
We're finished.

29:40.760 --> 29:41.886
What?

29:42.040 --> 29:44.202
Yeah, we finished it.
Do you want to see?

29:45.360 --> 29:46.361
Yeah.

29:47.800 --> 29:48.801
Hey, Sue.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.451
Can you show him?

29:56.720 --> 29:58.360
I'm really tired.
I'm gonna go take a nap.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.484
Can you tell Dr. Storm
for me? We did it, Victor.

30:35.240 --> 30:36.760
<i>- Harvey.
- Franklin.</i>

30:37.280 --> 30:38.770
Big day.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.242
Didn't think we'd make
it here, but well done.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.091
I told you
these kids could do it.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.651
Harvey's here.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.646
<i>Organic test commencing.</i>

30:59.680 --> 31:01.444
<i>Clear for launch.</i>

31:01.760 --> 31:02.761
<i>Goggles up.</i>

31:05.480 --> 31:06.481
<i>Ten...</i>

31:07.480 --> 31:08.481
<i>nine...</i>

31:09.160 --> 31:10.161
<i>eight...</i>

31:11.280 --> 31:12.281
<i>seven...</i>

31:13.440 --> 31:14.441
<i>six...</i>

31:15.360 --> 31:16.361
<i>five...</i>

31:17.160 --> 31:18.161
<i>four...</i>

31:19.840 --> 31:20.841
<i>three...</i>

31:22.120 --> 31:23.121
<i>two...</i>

31:24.520 --> 31:25.521
<i>one.</i>

31:46.840 --> 31:48.330
<i>Standing by
for video acquisition.</i>

31:52.760 --> 31:54.171
<i>Status unknown. Stand by.</i>

31:55.680 --> 31:57.603
<i>Trying an alternate frequency.</i>

31:59.080 --> 32:00.366
<i>We've got signal.</i>

32:08.000 --> 32:10.287
Look at the plates.
It's almost primordial.

32:10.440 --> 32:13.842
Unformed, like Earth
over a billion years ago.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.365
That place could explain

32:15.440 --> 32:17.408
the origin of our species.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.842
The evolution of our planet.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.365
Answers to questions
we don't even know to ask yet.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.921
BPS, body temp, ventilation
rates are all elevated.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.401
Let's bring him back.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.250
<i>Goggles up.</i>

32:48.480 --> 32:49.481
<i>In five...</i>

32:50.080 --> 32:51.081
<i>four...</i>

32:51.600 --> 32:52.601
<i>three...</i>

32:52.800 --> 32:53.801
<i>two...</i>

32:55.400 --> 32:56.606
<i>one.</i>

33:12.080 --> 33:13.411
How is he?

33:13.760 --> 33:15.091
The vitals are good.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.691
They're really good.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.161
He made it.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.250
It's safe.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.851
All right!
Looks like we're next.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.771
Gentlemen. Everyone.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.289
You all deserve
an enormous pat on the back.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.044
I think it's time
to start coordinating

33:47.120 --> 33:48.770
with our friends at NASA.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.006
What?

33:54.360 --> 33:56.806
It works. We have to start
thinking about sending men.

33:56.960 --> 33:57.961
Yeah.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.801
Us.

33:59.960 --> 34:01.291
Look, I won't deny that

34:01.360 --> 34:03.522
what you've created here
is incredible.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.365
But this isn't the school
science fair anymore.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.130
We have to
bring in help now.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.005
Why just NASA?
Why not the Army or the CIA?

34:11.159 --> 34:12.650
We could send
our political prisoners there.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.880
Waterboarding
in the fourth dimension

34:13.960 --> 34:15.246
could prove very effective.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.885
Why don't we discussthe
details of this someplace else?

34:20.040 --> 34:21.041
In the meantime...

34:21.239 --> 34:22.889
we appreciate your service.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.491
Oh. Hey, thank you.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.007
I won't let this go,
I promise you.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.328
Just give him a second
to figure this out.

34:45.239 --> 34:48.083
Look, I don't know about you
guys, but I could use some...

34:50.600 --> 34:51.601
Want a drink?

34:53.360 --> 34:55.362
Ethanol kills brain cells.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.960
You are a lightweight!

35:03.720 --> 35:05.290
Looks like
we need another refill.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.805
Here you go, Johnny.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.641
Yep.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.045
Yep.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.360
Hey, Vic.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.889
You guys know who built
the Apollo spacecraft,

35:19.960 --> 35:21.086
went to the moon?

35:22.280 --> 35:24.089
Yeah. Your mama.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.565
So, the answer's no.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.889
But you know who
Neil Armstrong is, right?

35:31.040 --> 35:32.724
Yeah, of course.
Of course.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.211
- Buzz Aldrin?
- Yeah.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.970
First men to
walk on the moon.

35:36.120 --> 35:39.602
Famous faces hired
to conquer dreams

35:39.680 --> 35:41.603
that weren't even theirs.

35:41.880 --> 35:44.645
Dreams that someone else,
some other scientist...

35:44.800 --> 35:46.962
who probably died
penniless and alone...

35:47.160 --> 35:50.403
and sat in a bar,
telling people

35:50.960 --> 35:53.008
he sent men to the moon.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.043
That's gonna be me.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.283
That's gonna be me.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.609
Think it's all of us.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.931
Unless we go first.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.563
Why don't we go first?
God, this thing works, okay?

36:12.720 --> 36:15.644
We can go up there,
take five minutes.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.040
We can take a flag
and plant it down,

36:17.120 --> 36:18.485
get our footprints down there.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.846
We're gonna be the first
people over there. Okay?

36:19.920 --> 36:21.285
Screw those guys!

36:21.360 --> 36:23.886
My dad might
actually kill me this time.

36:24.840 --> 36:26.649
Johnny, by the time
your dad finds out,

36:26.720 --> 36:28.404
we'll already be back.

36:28.760 --> 36:29.761
Think about it.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.850
Just the three of us?

36:45.240 --> 36:46.321
Hello?

36:46.480 --> 36:48.164
I'm not going without you.

36:48.560 --> 36:49.686
What time is it?

36:49.840 --> 36:51.126
<i>Look, we started
this thing together,</i>

36:51.200 --> 36:52.326
<i>we're going together.</i>

36:52.520 --> 36:54.124
<i>I'm not taking no
for an answer, okay?</i>

36:54.280 --> 36:55.770
Forget Neil Armstrong!
Come on.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.970
Neil Armstrong?

36:58.680 --> 36:59.886
You drunk?

37:00.040 --> 37:01.080
Yeah, I am a little drunk.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.929
It doesn't matter!
Look, the machine works.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.081
<i>The machine works, Ben,</i>

37:04.200 --> 37:05.964
<i>and I need you
to come with me.</i>

37:07.680 --> 37:08.727
Now?

37:08.800 --> 37:10.643
<i>Yeah. Look, Ben...</i>

37:10.800 --> 37:12.643
I need you to come
because we're going tonight.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.962
I told the guys that
I'm not going without you.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.088
Okay? Who's gonna
have my back?

37:18.160 --> 37:19.161
All right, fine.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.561
Just give me
a second, all right?

37:21.640 --> 37:22.641
<i>Okay.</i>

37:22.760 --> 37:23.761
Please?
<i>All right, buddy.</i>

37:23.840 --> 37:25.365
Thank you, thank you.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.804
He's with me.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.651
What's up, man?
What's up, buddy?

37:36.800 --> 37:38.200
How you doing?
It's good to see you.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.408
Thanks, Panno.
No problem, Mr. Richards.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.481
Why are we doing this tonight?

37:41.560 --> 37:42.561
Huh?

37:42.640 --> 37:44.529
Why are we doing this tonight?

37:44.680 --> 37:46.011
You trust me, right?

37:52.520 --> 37:53.760
Ta-da!

37:54.840 --> 37:57.605
It's just like ours,
but expensive.

38:00.640 --> 38:03.120
Guys, this is Ben.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.169
How you doing?
What's up?

38:05.320 --> 38:06.606
Are you his lucky charm?

38:06.800 --> 38:09.371
I'm sorry, this is Borat.
Borat's a dick.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.771
Are you guys
sure you're in

38:10.840 --> 38:11.887
the best shape
to be doing this?

38:12.040 --> 38:13.166
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.201
We're good.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.281
Let's do this.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.370
So, I guess I should
come up with

38:35.440 --> 38:38.171
something better than
"One small step for man..."?

38:38.320 --> 38:40.129
Strap in
and get comfy, kids.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.565
We're about to make history.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.202
Yeah, or die. Either/Or.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.727
Wow, that's great,
Ben. Thanks.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.810
All right, gentlemen.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.646
Hands and feet must remain
inside the ride at all times.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.570
Oh, shit.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.241
Dad, you need
to come to the lab.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.602
<i>Remote launch initiated.</i>

39:19.720 --> 39:20.846
Ten...

39:21.040 --> 39:24.089
Don't blow up.
Please, don't blow up.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.287
Oh, yeah, that's
what I wanna hear

39:25.360 --> 39:27.169
before going
into another dimension.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.324
Yeah, don't worry.
He does that.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.451
<i>...five...</i>

39:32.120 --> 39:33.201
<i>four...</i>

39:33.280 --> 39:35.089

39:35.960 --> 39:36.961

39:38.000 --> 39:39.081
<i>one.</i>

39:39.680 --> 39:41.648
<i>Initiate launch.</i>

39:47.960 --> 39:50.008
What happened? Did we abort?

39:52.800 --> 39:54.131
Uh...

39:54.200 --> 39:55.929
I don't think
that we went anywhere.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.686
God damn it.

40:04.560 --> 40:05.766
Johnny?

40:05.960 --> 40:07.405
Guys, can you hear me?

40:17.920 --> 40:18.921
Wow.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.165
I made it.

41:04.640 --> 41:07.564
Ben, look at this place.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.648
It's amazing.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.205
We did it.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.286
I think we did.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.720
Here, give me a hand.
Give me a hand.

41:25.920 --> 41:28.730
Oh, yeah. This one is
definitely going on Instagram.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.048
Let's do this. Ready?
After three.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.800
One, two, three!

41:34.400 --> 41:37.290
Whoa,
look at that. Whoa!

41:37.360 --> 41:39.886
Hey, Victor,
I think you should see this.

41:42.520 --> 41:45.524
The energy seems to be
converging over there.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.808
Come on.
Let's check it out.

41:50.440 --> 41:53.171
All right. Let's do it quickly
so we can get out of here.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.203
Nope. Uh-uh.

42:12.680 --> 42:13.841
I'm good.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.401
Reed, what's he doing?

42:21.600 --> 42:24.410
We need to climb down there
so we can get a better look.

42:24.600 --> 42:25.965
Oh, you guys
go on without me.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.167
Stay here.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.402
We need an anchor.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.609
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be a great anchor.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.041
Okay.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.121
Easy does it.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.444
Just a little further.

43:03.680 --> 43:04.920
Right behind you.

43:08.840 --> 43:09.921
Okay.

43:32.480 --> 43:35.211
It's responding
to physical stimulus.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.009
Almost like a nerve impulse.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.764
I can feel it.

43:39.880 --> 43:42.850
The energy, it's alive.

43:45.320 --> 43:46.321
It's incredible.

43:47.080 --> 43:48.923
There's no expenditure.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.809
Reed.
What?

43:51.960 --> 43:53.485
I think we should go back.

43:53.640 --> 43:56.450
This is important, Ben.
Come take a look.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.528
Go, go, go! Oh, shit!

44:15.080 --> 44:16.241
Come on!

44:19.680 --> 44:21.040
Come on,
come on! Hurry up!

44:26.760 --> 44:27.840
Come on, Reed!
Come on!

44:36.480 --> 44:37.481
Victor!

44:39.640 --> 44:40.846
Reed!
Hold on!

44:41.000 --> 44:42.047
Reed! Pull me up!

44:42.240 --> 44:43.241
Victor!

44:43.680 --> 44:44.681
Grab my hand!

44:45.680 --> 44:47.409
Reed, pull me up!

44:47.560 --> 44:48.846
Come on! Come on!

44:50.880 --> 44:52.564
Victor, hold on!

44:53.160 --> 44:55.288
Reed!
I can't hold him!

44:55.440 --> 44:56.521
Don't let go!

44:57.960 --> 44:59.007
Help me!

44:59.400 --> 45:00.526
Victor!

45:02.880 --> 45:03.881
Victor! No!

45:07.400 --> 45:08.811
Reed, let's go! Come on!

45:08.960 --> 45:10.803
Victor!
Come on!

45:11.440 --> 45:12.726
We can't leave him!

45:12.880 --> 45:15.042
Reed, we gotta go now!
Come on!

45:18.600 --> 45:20.170
Come on, come on!

45:21.040 --> 45:22.087
Come on!

45:23.280 --> 45:24.770
Move, let's move!

45:24.880 --> 45:26.370
Move your ass, Reed!

45:26.520 --> 45:28.727
Move it! Keep moving!

45:29.960 --> 45:31.041
Oh, my God.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.130
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

45:35.480 --> 45:36.641
Reed, let's go!

45:36.800 --> 45:37.801
Okay.

45:38.480 --> 45:39.481
Reed, come on!

45:39.640 --> 45:40.880
The re-entry's not working!

45:40.960 --> 45:42.405
I don't know what to do!

45:42.560 --> 45:43.846
Get us out of here!

45:45.960 --> 45:47.928
<i>Reed!
Do something! We gotta go!</i>

45:48.080 --> 45:49.525
Guys, can you hear me?

45:49.720 --> 45:50.880
Sue! Can you hear me?

45:51.000 --> 45:52.081
Johnny!

45:52.240 --> 45:54.120
<i>Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?</i>

45:54.160 --> 45:55.366
Yes, yes, I do!

45:55.560 --> 45:58.086
<i>Sue, I need you to manually
override the re-entry, okay?</i>

45:58.240 --> 45:59.730
Okay, I got it.

45:59.880 --> 46:01.609
<i>Manually override
the re-entry!</i>

46:01.760 --> 46:03.000
I'm trying!

46:03.560 --> 46:04.925
<i>Sue, just do it!</i>

46:06.000 --> 46:08.367
Reed! The door!
I can't close the door!

46:08.480 --> 46:09.561
Ben!

46:09.680 --> 46:10.806
The door won't close!

46:58.160 --> 46:59.161
Ben!

47:00.080 --> 47:01.081
Ben!

47:14.040 --> 47:15.041
Johnny!

47:26.280 --> 47:27.281
Reed!

47:27.440 --> 47:28.441
Ben.

47:29.400 --> 47:30.606
Oh, God!

47:30.760 --> 47:32.171
Ben!
Help me!

47:32.320 --> 47:33.685
I'm coming!

47:35.480 --> 47:37.528
Reed, help me!

47:38.760 --> 47:40.285
Can't move!

47:41.160 --> 47:42.161
Ben!

47:43.120 --> 47:44.360
Where are you?

47:44.880 --> 47:46.086
Reed?

47:47.520 --> 47:49.045
Help me.

47:49.440 --> 47:51.010
Ben.
Reed.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.241
Ben!

47:54.280 --> 47:56.169
Reed, help me. I can't move!

47:56.640 --> 47:58.290
I'll get you out of there.

48:03.120 --> 48:05.361
Oh, my God. What the...? What?

48:42.000 --> 48:43.604
Can we get a BP reading?

48:44.080 --> 48:46.048
BP 128 over 72.

48:46.680 --> 48:47.800
Bone density?

48:47.920 --> 48:49.365
Bone density rates are normal.

48:49.520 --> 48:52.046
<i>Reed, can you move your hand?</i>

48:52.240 --> 48:53.241
Where's Ben?

48:55.240 --> 48:56.605
<i>Keep trying, Reed.</i>

48:58.880 --> 49:00.689
Hey, do you guys know
where my friends are?

49:00.840 --> 49:02.410
<i>Can you lift
your index finger?</i>

49:02.480 --> 49:04.084
I...

49:04.160 --> 49:05.446
I'm trying.

49:06.720 --> 49:07.767
Where's Ben?

49:07.960 --> 49:10.531
Did you see him?
He was covered in the rocks.

49:10.680 --> 49:12.887
<i>Why won't you answer me?</i>

49:13.840 --> 49:16.047
Where are my friends?

49:16.560 --> 49:17.686
Help me!

49:18.120 --> 49:19.804
Increase sedative. 50 cc's.

49:20.120 --> 49:22.009
<i>What have
you guys done to me?</i>

49:34.520 --> 49:36.807
So, just for the record...

49:36.960 --> 49:39.691
this program was under your supervision,
was it not?

49:40.240 --> 49:41.969
I already told you it was,

49:42.080 --> 49:43.605
but I wasn't there
when it happened.

49:46.920 --> 49:50.288
All I want to know is,
where are my children?

49:52.000 --> 49:54.401
I need to know
if they're alive.

49:58.200 --> 49:59.770
She's unconscious.

50:01.200 --> 50:04.010
Somehow, she's shifting
in and out of the visible spectrum.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.489
We don't know how.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.490
Her vitals are stable.

50:15.240 --> 50:18.005
She doesn't seem
to be able to control it.

50:43.320 --> 50:44.924
Looks like
we have some activity.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.881
Son. Oh, my God.

51:42.760 --> 51:44.330
Can anyone hear me?

51:46.240 --> 51:48.322
Please, help me!

51:49.960 --> 51:51.724
Somebody, please!

51:53.200 --> 51:55.123
Is anybody there?

51:56.520 --> 51:57.646
Ben?

52:02.360 --> 52:04.124
Somebody answer me!

52:20.880 --> 52:22.370
Somebody, please!

52:22.800 --> 52:24.245
Help me!

52:25.560 --> 52:28.086
Can anyone hear me?

52:29.240 --> 52:31.322
Please, help me!

52:37.880 --> 52:39.041
Hello?

52:41.200 --> 52:42.929
Somebody answer me!

52:46.760 --> 52:48.091
Anybody?

52:52.280 --> 52:53.850
Ben?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.731
Ben!

52:59.160 --> 53:00.366
Reed?

53:00.520 --> 53:02.010
Oh, my God.

53:02.520 --> 53:03.567
Ben?

53:03.720 --> 53:05.722
Reed, what happened to me?

53:06.800 --> 53:09.804
I don't know.
But I'm gonna figure this out.

53:11.560 --> 53:13.324
Ben!

53:13.400 --> 53:16.006
Please help me, Reed!

53:16.560 --> 53:19.086
<i>Subject One
has escaped containment.</i>

53:19.240 --> 53:21.129
Oh, shit! Shit!

53:21.280 --> 53:23.521
Ben, I'm coming back for you,
I promise!

53:23.720 --> 53:25.688
No, no, no! Reed, help me!

53:26.360 --> 53:28.044
Please don't leave me!
I'm sorry.

53:28.200 --> 53:30.043
Reed, do something, please!

53:51.760 --> 53:54.366
Where is he? Where is Reed?

53:54.720 --> 53:56.085
I don't know.

53:57.080 --> 54:00.766
He's scared, Harvey.
They're all just scared kids.

54:00.960 --> 54:02.530
We don't know
what they are right now.

54:02.680 --> 54:05.729
All we know is that they
are dangerous and powerful.

54:05.880 --> 54:07.245
Which makes them
extremely valuable

54:07.320 --> 54:08.685
to the guys
who run this place.

54:08.840 --> 54:10.920
If you think for a minute
that I'm going to allow you

54:11.000 --> 54:12.520
to turn these kids
into some kind of...

54:12.680 --> 54:15.081
You don't have a choice,
Franklin. And neither do I.

54:15.240 --> 54:17.447
Either we play ball
with the government

54:17.600 --> 54:20.126
or who knows
what happens to those kids.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.401
Now...

54:23.560 --> 54:25.164
Here's how this is gonna go.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.170
So you're Ben Grimm.

54:37.360 --> 54:38.521
Where's Reed?

54:40.520 --> 54:43.649
I can't begin to imagine
what you are going through.

54:47.560 --> 54:49.289
He said he'll fix it.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.886
Where is Reed?

54:52.440 --> 54:56.047
Reed's gone.
Your friend isn't coming back.

54:58.240 --> 55:01.449
Look, I know you're scared.

55:01.880 --> 55:03.564
You should be.

55:03.720 --> 55:04.960
But we can help you.

55:05.120 --> 55:06.884
You wanna find a cure?

55:07.040 --> 55:10.089
We have resources here,
the best in the world.

55:10.440 --> 55:12.647
We're analyzing
what happened to you.

55:13.240 --> 55:16.449
Whatever it is, we can find
a way to reverse it.

55:17.400 --> 55:19.084
We can help you, Ben.

55:20.640 --> 55:22.881
But you need to help us, too.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.569
What do you want me to do?

55:50.320 --> 55:51.685
<i>His combat
effectiveness this past year</i>

55:51.760 --> 55:53.489
<i>has been unprecedented.</i>

55:53.640 --> 55:55.005
<i>In terms of potential,</i>

55:55.120 --> 55:57.200
<i>you already know what he's
accomplished in the field.</i>

55:58.280 --> 56:00.647
He's been active
in covert operations

56:00.720 --> 56:02.802
with a 100% success rate.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.890
Protecting our men
and women in battle

56:05.960 --> 56:08.008
and saving countless lives.

56:08.400 --> 56:12.928
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is only the beginning.

56:14.040 --> 56:16.930
The other survivors
of the "Baxter Incident"

56:17.080 --> 56:20.084
all exhibited
unique physical conditions.

56:20.400 --> 56:22.209
We developed suits
which allow them

56:22.280 --> 56:24.965
to contain and control
these conditions.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.845
This subject's suit
controls her spectral flares

56:30.920 --> 56:32.649
and refractive visibility.

56:32.800 --> 56:34.928
<i>With intense concentration</i>

56:35.120 --> 56:36.167
<i>she has also
developed the ability</i>

56:36.240 --> 56:37.765
<i>to render
other objects invisible.</i>

56:38.480 --> 56:41.563
<i>And, to neuropathically
produce force fields.</i>

56:43.160 --> 56:46.164
All these abilities
come from one place.

56:46.600 --> 56:48.921
Another dimension
that our scientists

56:49.000 --> 56:51.924
have taken to calling
"Planet Zero."

56:52.080 --> 56:54.401
A planet infused
with the same energy

56:54.480 --> 56:56.289
that transformed these survivors

56:56.440 --> 56:58.408
and potentially could transform

56:58.480 --> 57:00.528
our military capabilities.

57:01.480 --> 57:04.324
We have the direct link.

57:05.760 --> 57:07.524
With your continued support,

57:07.680 --> 57:10.490
once the Quantum Gate 2
project is finished,

57:10.640 --> 57:13.120
we'll have control
over more than that world.

57:13.840 --> 57:17.162
We'll have control over ours.

57:19.640 --> 57:22.166
Everyone, have a look.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.650
What the hell is that?

57:37.040 --> 57:38.849
Subject Number Two.

58:02.920 --> 58:05.844
<i>2,000 meters in six seconds.
New record.</i>

58:06.360 --> 58:07.327
Just need to work
on my takeoff.

58:07.400 --> 58:08.401
I can make it in five.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.722
<i>All target drones neutralized.</i>

58:12.240 --> 58:14.040
<i>Keep holding your breath, Susan.</i>

58:14.080 --> 58:15.411
<i>As long as you can.</i>

58:16.360 --> 58:18.044
<i>Directional stability
is 33 over 10.</i>

58:18.200 --> 58:21.090
<i>Rise is steady.
Pitch is eight degrees.</i>

58:21.440 --> 58:23.602
Your balance is getting better.

58:29.880 --> 58:30.927
Hey.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.769
They're gonna send me
on a project.

58:35.920 --> 58:36.921
Like Ben?

58:37.080 --> 58:39.048
We should use these powers
to do something.

58:39.160 --> 58:40.161
They're not powers.

58:40.280 --> 58:42.521
They're aggressively abnormal
physical conditions that we're gonna fix.

58:42.600 --> 58:43.647
Can you turn that off?

58:43.800 --> 58:45.086
And what if they can't?

58:45.160 --> 58:46.605
What if it takes
more time to get it right?

58:46.760 --> 58:48.444
We could be talking years.

58:48.600 --> 58:50.602
I am not going to be a tool.

58:53.480 --> 58:55.130
Johnny...
Stan, you ready?

58:55.280 --> 58:56.406
<i>Yes, we are.</i>

58:56.520 --> 58:57.601
Flame on.

59:01.160 --> 59:03.686
<i>Okay, Johnny.
Thank you, Sue.</i>

59:04.800 --> 59:06.131
Don't forget...

59:06.960 --> 59:08.928
We're here to get
our lives back.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.768
The subjects have agreed
to cooperate with us

59:15.920 --> 59:17.888
until we find
the source of their powers

59:17.960 --> 59:20.281
and, potentially, a cure.

59:21.320 --> 59:23.129
Why don't we go
see the big guy?

59:31.600 --> 59:32.960
<i>Hi, Ben.</i>

59:33.320 --> 59:34.845
<i>I got some friends
of mine here,</i>

59:34.960 --> 59:37.008
<i>from Washington D.C., visiting.</i>

59:37.160 --> 59:38.525
<i>Got a second to say hello?</i>

59:43.440 --> 59:45.647
<i>It's an honor
to meet you, Mr. Grimm.</i>

59:45.800 --> 59:48.531
<i>We appreciate
all you're doing for us.</i>

59:48.680 --> 59:51.001
That was the deal. Right?

59:52.000 --> 59:54.526
And there she is,
the Quantum Gate herself.

59:54.640 --> 59:56.529
The, uh, star of the show.

59:58.320 --> 59:59.526
Franklin.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.851
I'd like for you all
to meet Franklin Storm...

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.809
who is our supervisor
here on the floor.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.166
How do you do, sir?
Good morning.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.321
Good morning.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.561
How long until it's ready?

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.810
Well, we've had a few issues,
but we're getting closer.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.047
Closer every day.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.089
All right, Dr. Allen.
We'll give you what you need.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.321
In the meantime,
we'd like to put

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.243
more of your subjects
in the field.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.209
Subject Two is ready to go.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.251
Get him ready for combat.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.366
Susan!

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.883
Can I have a word with you?

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.009
They're sending
Johnny into the field.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.529
You mean he's sending himself
into the field.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.731
The only way to stop him
is to cure him.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.082
And that means
finishing the Gate.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.088
I can't finish it
without Reed.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:59.211
Reed's not coming back.
He abandoned us, left us here.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.124
He was afraid. He didn't
know what this place was.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.362
I can't believe
you're still defending him.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.241
Help me track him down, Suzu.
He'll listen to you.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.362
We'll reopen the Gate,
find a cure, end this.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.881
Johnny's your brother.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.123
It's never been as easy
for him as it has for you.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.604
But, like it or not,
he's family.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.125
And family means
we take care of each other.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.761
What can I do?

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.400
The FBI, CIA, and NSA

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.404
have blips of Reed
here and there...

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.561
but they can't seem to see...

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.971
A pattern.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.967
A pattern.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.485
Where was he last seen?

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.124
Three months ago, in Panama.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.441
Did you get an IP?

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.401
Early on,
he was using some old,
buried e-mail accounts.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.811
Bouncing off satellites.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.803
He's keeping himself
pretty well hidden.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.961
For a short while,
we were able

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.200
to ping him, here and there.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.805
Caught him on a few sites.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.970
He was looking for
scrap metal, buying parts.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.645
Never stayed online that long.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.643
Was he looking
for anything else?

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.491
He was searching for him.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.451
I'm gonna need some music.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.761
Excuse me?

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.851
I need music.
It helps me think.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.281
The valve is worn, it's not worth twenty.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960
I'll give you ten.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.846
I got people who work for me.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.805
Twenty or no deal.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:03.205
I'll give you five and
I'll fix your register for free.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.241
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.088
Captain Nemo.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.331
That's him.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.645
He's routing his e-mails
through this relay.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120
Got him.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.049
You did what you had to do.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.171
Hi, Ben.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.604
We've got another
project for you.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.327
I think you're gonna
like this one.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.371
Freeze! Do not move!

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.004
Get down on the ground!

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.561
Freeze!

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.085
Oh, my God. Ben!

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.888
So, this is where
you've been hiding out.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.520
Wait, stop.
Okay, let me explain.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.881
Why?

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.165
I'm no good to you, to anyone.
This is all my fault.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.367
That, we can agree on.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.251
Does it hurt?

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.526
I'm used to it.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.771
I'm sorry.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.881
That's what you said
when you left.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.930
I'm going to fix this.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.090
You can't fix this.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.965
Nobody can.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.481
I promise you,
I'm going to fix this.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.927
I stopped believing in your
bullshit a long time ago.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.082
You were my best friend.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.924
Look at me.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.409
I'm not your friend.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.127
You turned me
into something else.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.767
Nice work, Ben!

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.001
Hey, Reed.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.683
Look, I'm sorry,
but I didn't have a choice.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.368
We need your help
to finish the Gate.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.404
It's the only chance
we have to figure out

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.488
what happened to us,
and reverse it.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.041
You really think
that they care about us?

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.928
You know how
they've used Ben.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.082
Yeah. I do.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.246
And they're gonna do
the same thing

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:04.408
to Johnny
if we don't stop them.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:10.721
The only shot we've got is on
the other side of that Gate.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:17.443
Do you ever wonder what
life would have been like...

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:22.091
if you hadn't come
to the science fair that day?

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:26.770
We can't change the past.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.808
But we can change the future.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:35.604
You said you wanted your work
to make a difference.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.566
This is it.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:42.090
This is your chance.

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:49.281
Are you ready?

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.490
You made it ugly.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.961
It's good to
see you again, son.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.490
I'm gonna need ten minutes.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.330
To do what?

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.004
I need to make a couple
adjustments to the source code.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.003
You have a few steps
that are out of order.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.405
It can't be that simple.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.722
It might not be ten minutes.
It could be a little less.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.368
Come on. Let's go.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.851
I got a good feeling, Stan.
I'm gonna crack five seconds.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.004
Hey, could I take a couple
of minutes with my son?

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.571
Sure, no problem.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.209
<i>Guys, can you give us
five minutes?</i>

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.764
What's going on?

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.006
Reed is back.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.569
We're closer than
we've ever been before.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.164
Closer to what?

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.570
Our old lives.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.846
Oh, you mean your life?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.047
No, son.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.127
You always said
I had the potential

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.240
to do something important.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.010
Who's to say this isn't it?

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.243
Sometimes things
just happen for a reason.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.526
Johnny, you have no idea

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.364
what they are planning
to do to you.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.567
They're not doing
anything to me.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.284
I'm doing this with them.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.606
Johnny, you need
to listen to me...

01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.807
I did listen to you,
and that's what

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.370
got me here
in the first place.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.206
I'm an adult.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.249
I'm old enough to
make my own decisions.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.924
<i>Clear for launch.</i>

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.280
<i>Stand by.</i>

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.121
Look who it is.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:25.721
Hey.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.765
It's good seeing you, man.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.285
Good to see you, too.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.802
<i>Sonic projectors engaged.</i>

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.560
<i>Goggles up.</i>

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.445
<i>Initiate launch.</i>

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.289
<i>Systems check complete.</i>

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.641
<i>We have a visual.</i>

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.881
<i>Roger that, Control.</i>

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.962
Are you receiving
atmospheric data?

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.121
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.329
Checking configuration.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.323
Data transmission looks good.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.168
The landscape's changed.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.321
How?

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.961
I don't know,
it's just different.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.891
Commencing element
and geological test series.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.321
<i>Copy.</i>

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.002
Hey, Control, I'm picking up
a heat signature

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.361
about 60 yards away.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:47.886
Now, what could that be?

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.641
<i>Hard to make out.</i>

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.848
The signal keeps fluctuating.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.411
It's moving.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.371
Heading towards us.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.091
<i>Copy that.
Proceed with caution.</i>

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.524
<i>Do you have a visual?</i>

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.201
It appears to be a human form...

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.729
<i>with some sort of
foreign element around it.</i>

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.241
<i>I knew you'd come back.</i>

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.561
Victor?

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:31.881
Not possible.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.890
Subject appears injured.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.721
Get the med kit.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.041
Let's get him
to the shuttle.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.565
Grab him. Come on.
Easy, guys.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.882
Abort. Bring him back.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.246
<i>Aborting mission.</i>

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.600
<i>Stabilize the subject
and prepare for transport.</i>

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:54.961
Oh, shit.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.287
<i>Preparing for launch.</i>

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.125
<i>Transfer the subject
to Containment Room One.</i>

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.601
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.926
<i>His thermal signature
is barely registering.</i>

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.088
<i>His biochemistry
is off the charts.</i>

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.930
I want to talk to him.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.602
Nobody talks to him
until I do.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.122
Confine the others
to their quarters.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.291
Victor?

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.604
We don't know how
you survived over there

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.007
but we're still
analyzing the data.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.926
It appears that your

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.970
environment suit
fused with your body...

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.963
but we're working on that.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.969
<i>We're going to help you, Victor.</i>

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.525
<i>We're working with
the government now.</i>

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.171
We're going to send more

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.328
expeditions to the other side

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.851
but first you need
to tell us everything

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.564
you know about that place.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:36.689
You want to know
how I survived?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.049
That place kept me alive.

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.810
Gave me strength.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.364
Power.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.049
What kind of power?

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.848
The kind men like you
must never possess.

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:04.411
You couldn't resist coming back.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.725
It's not enough
to ruin your world.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.563
Now you want to ruin mine.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.201
Victor.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.841
If this world must die
so that mine may live...

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.240
so be it.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.406
<i>Code Red. Code Red.</i>

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.080
<i>There is an emergency
in this building.</i>

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.929
<i>Follow standard
emergency protocols.</i>

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.889
<i>Proceed to the nearest exit</i>

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.769
<i>and leave
the building immediately.</i>

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.721
<i>Code Red. Code Red.</i>

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.287
<i>There is an emergency
in this building.</i>

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:14.485
<i>Follow standard
emergency protocols.</i>

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.446
<i>Code Red. Code Red.</i>

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.485
<i>There is an emergency
in this building.</i>

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.325
<i>Follow standard
emergency protocols.</i>

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.444
<i>Proceed to the nearest exit</i>

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.488
<i>and leave
the building immediately.</i>

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.169
Running away again?

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.691
No.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.206
Sue!

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.643
My bad! Are you okay?

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.006
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.921
Where's Dad?

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.886
Victor, no.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.246
Just stop!

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.641
Out of my way, Franklin.
I'm going home.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.768
This is your home, son.

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.685
Not anymore.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.890
There is nothing
for you over there.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.842
Only the power
to create a new world.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.721
Victor, we're not gods.
We're just people.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.840
And we are stronger together
than we are apart.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:19.286
What good is it
if you're alone?

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.688
I have always been alone.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.921
Victor, stop!

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.081
Just stop!

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.489
It's too late, Susan.

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.091
The Earth is dying.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.521
Humanity had its chance.

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.761
No!
Dad!

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.848
Dad! No!
Dad, no, I'm sorry!

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.286
Dad, no!

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.291
Dad!

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.680
Dad!
Dad, move!

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:54.927
Victor, no!

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.965
Promise me.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.041
What?

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:08.489
Look after each other.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.122
Dad, I'm sorry!
Dad, I'm sorry.

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.050
Dad, please.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.281
No!

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.569
He's overloading the system
to create a runaway reaction.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.881
It's not gonna stop!

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.731
It'll create a black hole
that'll swallow the Earth!

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.682
He's pulling everything
into the other dimension!

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.641
Hold on!

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.566
Johnny!

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.641
Got it!

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:21.085
The matter from Earth is
being converted to energy!

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:24.005
We need to stop Victor!
He's the source!

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.686
He's mine!

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.161
I have an idea.

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.003
This is what I do.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.327
Where are you, Susan?

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.929
Victor, don't do this!

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.811
There is no Victor.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.367
There is only Doom.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.405
I saw a different future
for us, Susan.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:42.926
Help me!

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.605
Reed!

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.521
Ben!

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.724
Goodbye, Susan.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.921
Ah!

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.001
Reed!

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.206
Is he dead?

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.529
If that thing's
still active, so is he.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.525
We can't beat him.
He's stronger than any of us.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.685
Yeah, he is.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.524
But he's not stronger
than all of us.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.164
Look, this place
gave him his powers...

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.328
but it gave us
all of ours, too.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.730
It's who we are now.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.646
Maybe it's who
we're meant to be.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.171
We opened this door,
we're gonna close it.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:32.926
So, what's the plan?

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.646
Enough!

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.442
When your world is destroyed,
and I'm all that's left...

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:55.284
then it will be enough.

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:33.362
Always so smug,

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:35.284
thinking you were
smarter than me.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.726
I am smarter than you.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.240
Now!

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.801
Hey! It's clobbering time!

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.764
This better work.

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:15.561
No.

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.489
Let's get
the hell out of here!

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.281
<i>While the world
may not know</i>

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:07.566
<i>what you did to save it...</i>

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.722
The men and the women
in this room do.

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.763
And so does the President.

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.570
That said,

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.520
we'd like to continue
our existing relationship.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.770
So, if we're all in agreement...

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.604
We're not.

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:23.521
Excuse me?

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.648
We're not remotely
"all in agreement."

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.610
We don't need you or anybody
else to keep an eye on us.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:30.444
We just want a place
where we can work.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.922
And whatever we come up with
belongs to us.

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.967
And what if we say no?

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.522
Say yes.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.845
How much space
are we talking about?

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.600
A lot.

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.691
Whoa. Hey.

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.601
So, uh, I thought there were
gonna be four of you?

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.886
Oh, there is.

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.329
Labs are upstairs.

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.881
Engineering's on the south side

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.247
and Assembly's downstairs.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:25.282
We've been operating out of
here for over 12 years, now.

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.602
Well, officially, that is.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.685
But you still
won't find our name

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.842
on any government books.

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:37.202
Most people just refer
to this as, uh, Central City.

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:40.569
But call it whatever you want.
We work for you now.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.361
Oh, wow.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.608
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:50.171
That's pretty nice.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.890
I'm taking that area
over there.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.164
I could get used to this.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.085
I got it.

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.362
The "Franklin Storm
Research Center."

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.844
Dad was kind of allergic
to his name in big letters.

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:06.050
Which reminds me,
I think that the four of us

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.485
should have a name.

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:09.130
Why would we need a name?

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.320
Because we're a team now,
and there's four of us

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.840
so we should come up
with a name for it.

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:18.563
Like, "The Human Torch
and the Torchettes."

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:19.841
Ugh.
No.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.206
Are you kidding me?

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:24.321
How about "The Big Brain
and His Neurons"?

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:26.164
How about "The Big Brain
and Her Neurons"?

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.731
How about "Two Guys, a Girl,

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.609
"and the Thing
that Nobody Wanted"?

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.400
Hey, we both know
that you could take him.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.369
Hey.
Hey. What?

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.603
We've come a long way
since the garage.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.364
Gotta say, it's fantastic.

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.410
Say that again.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.369
It's fantastic.

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:55.846
Yes, it is.

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.204
Guys, I got it.

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.286
Ready?
Yeah.
