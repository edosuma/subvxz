00:30.708 --> 00:32.712
Hey! Your mother's looking for you.

00:34.736 --> 00:38.768
If I'd known you wanted me to work
on my day off, I wouldn't have come.

00:38.768 --> 00:39.780
And what have you done?

00:39.780 --> 00:41.764
Fridge, ice machine, decorations.

00:41.764 --> 00:44.772
The decking and the chairs
could do with a wipe, though.

00:44.772 --> 00:48.764
By the way, you look sexy as hell in
those gloves.

00:48.764 --> 00:49.796
What?

00:51.772 --> 00:53.712
See how I've still got it?

00:53.712 --> 00:55.704
Really? Florence!

00:55.704 --> 00:57.704
Yeah?

00:57.704 --> 00:58.708
Nothing.

00:58.708 --> 00:59.780
Patrice.
Hey.

00:59.780 --> 01:01.732
Is it OK if I go now?

01:01.732 --> 01:02.760
I need to get ready.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.784
Yeah. You need your other half
to help you get changed?

01:04.784 --> 01:06.704
He's only getting in my way.

01:06.704 --> 01:08.736
No, you keep him here.
I'm picking Nelly up on the way,

01:08.736 --> 01:09.772
and my mum will be at the house.

01:09.772 --> 01:11.796
What's it like to be popular?
Bye!

01:11.796 --> 01:13.756
All right, see you later!
Enjoy!

01:13.756 --> 01:15.704
Bye!

01:17.752 --> 01:18.788
Hey, Tiana.

01:21.728 --> 01:23.780
Girl, you should've been here
five minutes ago.

01:23.780 --> 01:25.736
We've got plenty of time.

01:25.736 --> 01:28.752
Ha! That's all right for you,
you're the festival queen,

01:28.752 --> 01:30.756
and I'm the maid smelling of fish.

01:30.756 --> 01:32.724
I need longer to get ready!

01:32.724 --> 01:34.724
You don't smell of fish.

01:34.724 --> 01:35.752
SNIFFS

01:35.752 --> 01:37.732
OK, I lied.

01:37.732 --> 01:39.728
LAUGHS

01:44.748 --> 01:45.796
Table seven.
Thank you.

01:47.752 --> 01:49.700
Oh, you made it!
Yes!

01:49.700 --> 01:50.776
I'll get you a drink, sir.
Hey!

01:50.776 --> 01:51.796
Jack, good to see you, man.

01:51.796 --> 01:54.772
Yeah, my first Mahi Mahi festival.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:54.772 --> 01:56.768
Well, I'll warn you,

01:56.768 --> 01:59.768
it goes on late and has been known
to get a bit messy.

01:59.768 --> 02:00.776
Oh, well, in that case...

02:00.776 --> 02:02.704
LAUGHS

02:02.704 --> 02:04.764
It's only a week to the wedding.
Shouldn't you be pacing yourself?

02:04.764 --> 02:06.704
I'll tell you what,

02:06.704 --> 02:07.776
I'll stay two drinks behind you.

02:09.752 --> 02:11.752
There you go.
Great.

02:11.752 --> 02:13.740
Enjoy.
Thanks.

02:14.740 --> 02:18.776
My beautiful daughter
is getting ready to be Mama D'Mer.

02:18.776 --> 02:22.708
Turn around, show us.

02:27.764 --> 02:29.776
Hm, not bad.

02:29.776 --> 02:31.792
Considering what you had to work
with!

02:31.792 --> 02:33.760
You look beautiful.

02:36.760 --> 02:40.748
The tradition is Mama D'Mer
will make an offering to the ocean

02:40.748 --> 02:42.748
in return for the mahi-mahi fish.

02:42.748 --> 02:45.716
That seems fair. What's in this
offering?

02:45.716 --> 02:46.776
Bread, flowers and rum.

02:46.776 --> 02:48.728
Of course!

02:48.728 --> 02:51.704
Not much happens out here
that doesn't involve rum.

03:01.700 --> 03:02.744
OK. You're good?

03:02.744 --> 03:03.784
I'm good.
OK.

03:07.748 --> 03:10.740
So, Mama D'Mer,

03:10.740 --> 03:12.796
you got everything?

03:12.796 --> 03:15.760
Um, no sneaky swigs on the way.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.736
Promise.
Good luck, girl.

03:17.736 --> 03:19.728
Bye!
Bye!

03:39.796 --> 03:43.704
She's coming!
Hey!

03:43.704 --> 03:45.760
Tiana!

03:45.760 --> 03:47.704
Tiana!

03:47.704 --> 03:49.716
Tiana!

03:49.716 --> 03:52.740
Go on. Go on, Tiana!

03:52.740 --> 03:54.740
Go on, Ti!

03:54.740 --> 03:56.708
Tiana!

03:56.708 --> 03:58.752
Oh, look at my baby!

03:58.752 --> 04:00.792
She get off all right?
Yeah, everything all good.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.716
Go on, Ti!

04:11.780 --> 04:13.728
Something's wrong.

04:13.728 --> 04:15.728
What's happening?

04:17.796 --> 04:19.779
Nelly.

04:24.724 --> 04:26.700
Come on, Harrison!

04:27.796 --> 04:29.788
Harrison!
Come on, come on.

04:35.768 --> 04:37.776
Tiana?
Tiana?

04:37.776 --> 04:39.772
Ti!
Tiana!

04:41.740 --> 04:42.748
Tiana.

04:42.748 --> 04:44.792
Ti...
What's happening? Tiana!

04:44.792 --> 04:46.704
Ti!
Tiana!

04:46.704 --> 04:48.744
GASPS

04:48.744 --> 04:50.764
Tiana.
Tiana...

04:50.764 --> 04:53.748
No, no, no, no, no, no...

05:30.768 --> 05:32.780
She can't be much older than my
Siobhan.

05:33.784 --> 05:34.792
It makes no sense.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.784
Every person in this village loved
her.

05:38.700 --> 05:39.772
They all watched her grow up.

05:39.772 --> 05:42.724
She was the girlfriend
of Patrice's mate.

05:42.724 --> 05:43.744
Yes. Harrison.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.724
Harrison, stop!
Poor fella.

05:45.724 --> 05:48.724
You don't want to see her like that!

05:55.768 --> 05:59.720
Well, it looks like she was killed
by a single stab wound.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.708
The blade is wide, too.

06:01.708 --> 06:02.788
Maybe an inch in diameter.

06:02.788 --> 06:03.796
We've cleared the area, sir.

06:03.796 --> 06:06.704
OK, Ruby. When you're finished
documenting the scene,

06:06.704 --> 06:07.764
gather her immediate family and
friends.

06:07.764 --> 06:09.728
We need to talk to them.
Yes, sir.

06:10.752 --> 06:14.744
Just so you know, sir, Tiana's
mother appears to have gone.

06:14.744 --> 06:17.740
And she was here when the boat
arrived, but hasn't been seen since.

06:17.740 --> 06:18.768
Really?

06:18.768 --> 06:20.732
Well, I'm sure she was distraught.

06:20.732 --> 06:22.720
See if you can track her down.
Yeah.

06:28.752 --> 06:32.768
You said Mama D'Mer offers the ocean
rum, bread and flowers

06:32.768 --> 06:34.704
in exchange for fish.

06:34.704 --> 06:35.724
Yes.

06:35.724 --> 06:39.708
Well, we've got the rum
and the flowers, but no bread.

06:39.708 --> 06:40.760
That's odd.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.764
Yeah.

06:41.764 --> 06:45.760
Do you think Tiana could have thrown
it in to the sea?

06:45.760 --> 06:49.712
Well, usually, they wait until
the boat is around the headland,

06:49.712 --> 06:50.752
where everyone can see.

06:50.752 --> 06:53.724
Well, if she didn't throw it
out of the boat, where is it?

06:53.724 --> 06:54.764
Please, come in and take a seat.

06:55.780 --> 06:56.784
Thank you.

07:02.744 --> 07:04.760
I'm so sorry for your loss.

07:04.760 --> 07:05.796
All of you.

07:05.796 --> 07:10.716
Sir, this is Harrison Green,
Tiana's boyfriend,

07:10.716 --> 07:11.764
and Ellen Dubois.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.792
Nelly.
She was Tiana's best friend.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.736
So, Nelly,

07:16.736 --> 07:20.756
it was you who saw Tiana off on her
boat from beyond the headland?

07:22.788 --> 07:26.728
We got ready at her house,
then I drove her to the old jetty.

07:30.724 --> 07:35.712
And you actually saw her set off on
the boat?Yes. She was fine.

07:35.712 --> 07:37.756
She waved and started heading
out to sea.

07:37.756 --> 07:39.704
Was anyone else there?

07:39.704 --> 07:40.728
No, it was just us.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.716
I can show you.

07:42.716 --> 07:44.712
I've been filming the whole day.

07:45.716 --> 07:46.764
It's on my phone.

07:52.724 --> 07:53.740
It is.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.768
Your phone says 5.47.

07:59.768 --> 08:02.744
How long would it take her
to get around the headland by boat?

08:02.744 --> 08:04.784
Since the tide was against her
a little bit...

08:06.748 --> 08:08.740
...three minutes, maybe.

08:08.740 --> 08:11.716
And did you see anybody else
in the water?

08:11.716 --> 08:13.728
Other boats, swimmers, maybe?

08:13.728 --> 08:15.724
No.

08:15.724 --> 08:17.724
We'll need to keep this for a while.

08:23.744 --> 08:27.776
And, Harrison, yourself and Tiana,
had you been together long?

08:27.776 --> 08:29.700
I've known her all my life.

08:29.700 --> 08:30.792
Um, grew up together.

08:32.748 --> 08:34.703
It was only ever her.

08:37.732 --> 08:39.784
She worked for you, Patrice,
at the bar?

08:39.784 --> 08:42.720
Evenings and weekends.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.724
I mean, she started here
when she was, what, 17?

08:45.724 --> 08:47.728
Customers loved her.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.708
She made more in tips
than she did wages.

08:51.700 --> 08:55.760
Did any of you notice anything
unusual over the last few days?

08:55.760 --> 08:57.740
She was the same as always.

08:58.748 --> 09:00.724
Happy.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.752
Well, I feel I've troubled you
more than enough for now.

09:07.788 --> 09:09.756
Oh, one more thing.

09:09.756 --> 09:10.768
Um...

09:11.764 --> 09:13.716
Who packed Tiana's bag?

09:13.716 --> 09:15.720
The offerings for the sea.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.760
She did it here, at the bar.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.796
And is there any way she might have
forgotten to put the bread in?

09:19.796 --> 09:21.712
I mean, is that a possibility?

09:21.712 --> 09:26.744
No, I gave her the bread from my
kitchen, and the bottle of rum.

09:26.744 --> 09:28.772
Someone must have taken it out,
then.

09:28.772 --> 09:32.764
Well, if it was not there, then...
I guess so.

09:32.764 --> 09:35.716
Hm. Thank you for your time.

09:35.716 --> 09:37.728
Sorry. About everything.

09:43.796 --> 09:48.744
Well, we've seen the video Nelly
took of Tiana leaving at 5.47.

09:48.744 --> 09:50.748
Let's have a look at the video
I took.

09:51.792 --> 09:55.780
Right, there she is, rounding
the headland, at, what, 5.50?

09:55.780 --> 10:00.700
Nelly has her leaving at 5.47,
that's...three minutes.

10:01.712 --> 10:04.724
That's not an awful lot of time
to make it around the bay.

10:04.724 --> 10:08.708
So how did whoever killed Tiana
manage to board a boat mid-journey
and stab her?

10:08.708 --> 10:11.720
Well, there were no other boats
or swimmers in the water

10:11.720 --> 10:12.756
on any of the footage we've got.

10:12.756 --> 10:14.704
And if it only took three minutes,

10:14.704 --> 10:17.720
there wasn't time for Tiana
to stop off somewhere on the way.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.792
Exactly. So, how?

10:18.792 --> 10:20.708
Oh!It's OK.

10:20.708 --> 10:22.752
You don't have to put up your
hand.Sorry.

10:22.752 --> 10:23.796
But what about a diver?

10:23.796 --> 10:27.748
Now, Nelly said there were no other
boats or swimmers,

10:27.748 --> 10:30.756
but she wouldn't have seen a diver
because they go under the water.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.764
So I would like to propose
that a diver was waiting.

10:33.764 --> 10:35.752
He saw the boat go over him,

10:35.752 --> 10:37.788
swam to the surface,
grabbed the side of the boat,

10:37.788 --> 10:42.748
stabbed Tiana and then dived back
down to the murky depths from whence
he came.

10:42.748 --> 10:45.732
It is the only explanation.

10:45.732 --> 10:46.740
True.

10:48.768 --> 10:50.760
But the boat was bone-dry.

10:50.760 --> 10:54.720
If someone climbed on board from
the sea, it would've been wet.

10:55.720 --> 10:56.752
Dammit.

10:58.740 --> 11:00.724
PHONE RINGS
What happened out there?

11:01.796 --> 11:04.708
JP?

11:05.740 --> 11:06.792
Yes, we're on our way.

11:08.716 --> 11:10.776
He's found Louise Palmer.
Good.

11:17.796 --> 11:19.712
She's drunk.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.768
She wanted more,
but I refused to serve her.

11:23.748 --> 11:25.708
Why?

11:25.708 --> 11:26.764
We were good friends once.

11:26.764 --> 11:30.704
But when she found out
her husband was having an affair,

11:30.704 --> 11:31.772
she started to drink.

11:31.772 --> 11:34.740
I thought she was getting some help.

11:34.740 --> 11:36.756
Louise is a recovering alcoholic.

11:36.756 --> 11:37.772
And you know her well?

11:37.772 --> 11:40.712
We lost touch,
until she came in this week.

11:40.712 --> 11:45.708
Any reason for losing touch?
I run a bar...

11:48.760 --> 11:49.792
Mrs Palmer?

11:51.792 --> 11:53.740
Louise...

11:54.788 --> 11:56.716
SOBS:I'm sorry...

11:58.764 --> 11:59.788
I'm so sorry!

11:59.788 --> 12:02.764
Oh, now,
what have you got to be sorry for?

12:05.712 --> 12:08.732
We can't speak to her like this.
JP, take her home, please.

12:08.732 --> 12:10.700
Yes, sir.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.772
All right, Mrs Palmer,
I'm just going to lift you up here.

12:12.772 --> 12:16.760
All right. Oops, sorry.
OK, come along.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.744
OK.

12:25.736 --> 12:26.780
Catherine,

12:26.780 --> 12:30.764
you said you hadn't seen her
until this week, not today.

12:30.764 --> 12:32.708
Yes.

12:32.708 --> 12:33.740
She was here last Friday.

12:33.740 --> 12:34.768
Was she?

12:34.768 --> 12:36.768
And how did she seem?

12:36.768 --> 12:38.752
Not good.

12:38.752 --> 12:40.772
She'd obviously been drinking again,

12:40.772 --> 12:43.740
and I had to call Tiana
to come and pick her up.

12:43.740 --> 12:46.728
Come on, Mama, come on.
I know you're leaving me.

12:46.728 --> 12:48.700
Yeah, well, it can't come soon
enough.

12:48.700 --> 12:49.796
And I thought you loved me!

12:56.760 --> 12:59.760
It's OK. I'll take her home.

12:59.760 --> 13:00.788
I'm sorry!

13:00.788 --> 13:03.748
Have you any idea
what they were arguing about?

13:04.756 --> 13:05.764
No.

13:05.764 --> 13:09.728
But Tiana is Louise's life.

13:09.728 --> 13:10.776
She'd never hurt her.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.780
Well, Florence, what do you think?

13:27.780 --> 13:29.732
Um...

13:29.732 --> 13:31.748
Well, you look very smart.

13:31.748 --> 13:33.776
Well, I didn't want to let the side
down at your wedding.

13:33.776 --> 13:37.764
Oh, I called the Belle Mer harbour
master first thing this morning,

13:37.764 --> 13:39.760
asked him to check his radar logs.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.784
He confirmed there were no other
vessels in the vicinity at the time

13:42.784 --> 13:45.776
the victim's boat left the jetty
and headed for the harbour.

13:45.776 --> 13:47.784
So... Ow!

13:47.784 --> 13:50.736
Sorry, Inspector.

13:50.736 --> 13:52.724
It seems to be a new thing to have
here -

13:52.724 --> 13:54.732
acupuncture, with a free suit
thrown in.

13:54.732 --> 13:55.792
You all done?

13:56.796 --> 13:58.728
Yeah.

14:03.764 --> 14:06.704
Morning, Ruby. JP.

14:06.704 --> 14:07.740
BOTH:Morning, sir.

14:07.740 --> 14:09.740
Excellent, you've got the board
ready.

14:09.740 --> 14:12.720
Yeah, Ruby did it.
She came in early.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.724
Very early.

14:13.724 --> 14:17.784
So, I have a photo of Patrice.

14:17.784 --> 14:19.768
I mean, usually,
I'd put it up on the board,

14:19.768 --> 14:21.728
but under the circumstances, I...

14:22.740 --> 14:24.712
Florence,

14:24.712 --> 14:27.728
should we include your fiance
as a possible murder suspect?

14:27.728 --> 14:28.784
I think I can vouch for him.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.736
OK.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.744
So, what have we got here?

14:34.748 --> 14:36.768
Tiana Palmer, only 22.

14:36.768 --> 14:38.732
Born and raised in Belle Mer.

14:38.732 --> 14:40.700
Well, not born here,

14:40.700 --> 14:41.780
but she was raised here.

14:41.780 --> 14:45.700
Bradley and Louise Palmer
adopted her when she was two.

14:45.700 --> 14:46.736
Adopted?

14:46.736 --> 14:47.760
Her birth parents around?

14:47.760 --> 14:51.720
No, she came from an orphanage
on the south side of the island.

14:52.728 --> 14:54.768
A very popular girl,
by all accounts.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.772
No obvious reason
why anyone would want to harm her.

14:58.776 --> 15:01.712
OK, well, let's start
with the people closest to her.

15:01.712 --> 15:04.732
OK, Harrison Green,
Tiana's boyfriend.

15:04.732 --> 15:05.760
Age 26.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.712
Lives at home with his parents
and runs a family business.

15:09.712 --> 15:11.708
Pretty much the only water-taxi
in Belle Mer.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.788
Harrison and Tiana grew up
on the same road together.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.784
Their families are really close.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.700
I ran a finance check.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.760
Harrison's private accounts
aren't too healthy.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.768
Direct debit payments to two credit
cards.

15:21.768 --> 15:23.780
I'm just waiting for details on
those.

15:23.780 --> 15:26.784
He was helping out at Patrice's bar
the whole time, wasn't he?

15:26.784 --> 15:28.788
I think so, but I can check with
Patrice.

15:28.788 --> 15:31.720
Great. OK, next we have Ellen.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.720
Nelly Dubois.

15:33.720 --> 15:34.784
Tiana's best friend.

15:34.784 --> 15:36.712
21 years old.

15:36.712 --> 15:39.712
One of four children,
but the only girl.

15:39.712 --> 15:43.716
The Dubois family have had fishing
boats there for over nine
generations,

15:43.716 --> 15:46.736
and Nelly recently set up
her own fishing boat.

15:46.736 --> 15:49.732
I think she's in stiff competition
with her brothers.

15:49.732 --> 15:52.740
Well, she was the last person
to see Tiana Palmer alive.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.712
And the victim's mother.

15:55.712 --> 15:57.704
Louise Palmer, recovering alcoholic.

15:57.704 --> 15:59.716
I've heard Harrison talk about her.

15:59.716 --> 16:01.712
Very protective about Tiana.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.792
Yet we know from Catherine she had a
fight with Tiana just last Friday.

16:03.792 --> 16:06.768
Might help to know
what that was all about.

16:08.776 --> 16:11.752
These people
were all on that harbour-side,

16:11.752 --> 16:14.772
so would've had to leave and come
back

16:14.772 --> 16:16.720
as the body was discovered.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.796
OK...

16:21.724 --> 16:23.724
Let's make sure they're all
accounted for

16:23.724 --> 16:24.760
between, say, 5.30 and 6pm.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.756
Um, sir,

16:26.756 --> 16:29.768
I checked Tiana's financial records,

16:29.768 --> 16:31.736
and she had savings,

16:31.736 --> 16:35.724
but last week she paid 300

16:35.724 --> 16:37.760
to Paradise Homes,
a local letting agency.

16:38.788 --> 16:40.772
Now, I called them this morning,

16:40.772 --> 16:43.724
and they said
that it was 50% of a deposit.

16:44.780 --> 16:46.744
So Tiana was leaving her mum's
house.

16:46.744 --> 16:47.752
It looks like it.

16:49.744 --> 16:51.788
What did Catherine hear
Tiana say to Louise?

16:51.788 --> 16:53.732
"It can't come soon enough."

16:53.732 --> 16:55.744
Maybe that was it.

16:55.744 --> 16:57.772
They were arguing about Tiana moving
out.

16:58.776 --> 17:01.732
Well, we should speak to her mum
first.

17:01.732 --> 17:03.708
Hopefully, she'll have sobered up.

17:03.708 --> 17:04.756
JP, you and Ruby come too.

17:04.756 --> 17:06.776
See if you can find anything
in Tiana's room while we're there.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.715
BOTH:Yes, sir.

17:09.752 --> 17:12.732
I don't normally drink.

17:13.763 --> 17:15.708
I'm an alcoholic.

17:15.708 --> 17:17.704
But I guess you already know that.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.780
Well, it's not our place to judge
you, Louise.

17:20.784 --> 17:23.743
But I do need to ask you
about last Friday.

17:25.723 --> 17:26.752
We spoke to Catherine.

17:26.752 --> 17:27.768
Oh.

17:28.772 --> 17:30.796
She told us about the argument
you had with Tiana.

17:32.708 --> 17:33.752
It was about Tiana moving out, yeah?

17:33.752 --> 17:35.792
SOBS:I didn't want her to go.

17:35.792 --> 17:37.720
Course you didn't.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.740
Once they go, they never come back,
do they?

17:44.704 --> 17:47.728
So you were angry that she was
leaving?

17:47.728 --> 17:49.728
I try real hard...

17:50.796 --> 17:53.708
...but that night I had a drink.

17:54.752 --> 17:57.700
And I'm not nice when I'm drunk.

17:58.776 --> 18:00.712
Did you hit her?

18:00.712 --> 18:02.720
I thought you loved me!

18:06.748 --> 18:10.796
She knew how sorry I was,
how ashamed.

18:12.716 --> 18:13.792
Was she still planning to move out?

18:13.792 --> 18:16.716
Yes.

18:16.716 --> 18:18.740
And why shouldn't she?

18:18.740 --> 18:21.732
She and Harrison were
a lovely couple.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.764
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

18:33.748 --> 18:35.728
GIGGLES

18:35.728 --> 18:37.708
SIGHS WISTFULLY

18:40.792 --> 18:42.732
Is anything wrong, Ruby?

18:42.732 --> 18:44.752
Oh! No. Why?

18:44.752 --> 18:46.704
Should there be?

18:46.704 --> 18:48.724
No...

18:49.732 --> 18:52.740
OK, question.

18:52.740 --> 18:53.752
On a scale of one to 100,

18:53.752 --> 18:56.736
how wrong is it to lust over
a murder victim's boyfriend?

18:56.736 --> 18:57.788
20?

18:57.788 --> 18:59.748
30?

18:59.748 --> 19:02.708
He is a murder suspect,
and you are a police officer.

19:02.708 --> 19:03.784
OK, 45?

19:03.784 --> 19:06.700
SIGHS:But have you seen his thighs,
though, JP?

19:06.700 --> 19:08.716
I mean, you could crack a coconut
between them.

19:08.716 --> 19:10.748
Let's just concentrate
on doing the work, OK?

19:10.748 --> 19:12.748
Oh, I know, we've got to be
professional.

19:14.720 --> 19:18.720
Excuse me for sharing.

19:18.720 --> 19:19.760
What are you doing now, Ruby?

19:19.760 --> 19:24.768
She was a girl who lived with her
mother. You have to hide things.

19:39.780 --> 19:41.752
It's a phone number.

19:41.752 --> 19:42.768
Could be important.

19:44.744 --> 19:45.748
So...

19:46.796 --> 19:48.720
...could these.

19:57.764 --> 19:58.796
You know who she is?

20:03.700 --> 20:04.732
Great, thanks.

20:06.704 --> 20:09.700
Tiana died within minutes
from a single stab wound,

20:09.700 --> 20:10.760
probably from a knife like that.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.732
COMPUTER BEEPS

20:12.732 --> 20:15.772
Oh, the Harrison Green
credit card reports JP asked for.

20:15.772 --> 20:17.796
Both maxed out.

20:17.796 --> 20:21.700
So, he'd reached his overdraft.

20:21.700 --> 20:22.776
His cards were maxed out.

20:22.776 --> 20:26.716
Not a great time
to put a deposit on a new house.

20:26.716 --> 20:31.764
These look like
mostly ATM cash withdrawals.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.740
Why did he need so much cash?

20:33.740 --> 20:35.788
I don't know. We could ask him.

20:35.788 --> 20:37.784
Unless he's got something to hide,

20:37.784 --> 20:40.708
in which case,
we might just get a pack of lies.

20:41.776 --> 20:45.712
But maybe someone else might know
what's going on in his life.

20:45.712 --> 20:46.740
Who?

20:46.740 --> 20:47.756
His best friend.

20:49.776 --> 20:52.712
All right, lads. Yourselves?

20:52.712 --> 20:53.748
Up to mischief? Ha-ha!

20:58.724 --> 21:00.720
Hey, you finished early.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.736
I need to talk to you about
Harrison.

21:03.744 --> 21:04.748
OK.

21:05.772 --> 21:08.708
You've known him since you were
children, right?

21:08.708 --> 21:09.720
We went to school together.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.704
I can't remember a time I didn't
know him.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.712
So he confides in you?

21:14.712 --> 21:15.788
Sometimes.

21:15.788 --> 21:20.716
Look, what is this? Is he in
trouble?No, no, it's just
routine, I promise.

21:20.716 --> 21:24.728
We just need to build a picture
of everyone who knew Tiana.

21:24.728 --> 21:27.748
Has he...has he talked to you
about the business?

21:27.748 --> 21:29.704
Um, a bit.

21:29.704 --> 21:31.784
I mean, I know things weren't great,
but he'll get through it.

21:31.784 --> 21:36.712
He also used his ATM card
to take out a lot of cash.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.700
Have you any idea why?

21:38.700 --> 21:41.728
Wait, you go through
his private accounts?

21:41.728 --> 21:44.748
Well, it's a murder inquiry,
Patrice. We go through everything.

21:45.768 --> 21:48.760
Well, I don't know why
he's been taking the money out.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.744
Is that it?

21:50.744 --> 21:52.760
Grilling over?

21:52.760 --> 21:53.776
One last thing.

21:54.776 --> 21:56.708
The day of the festival,

21:56.708 --> 22:00.704
can you remember seeing Harrison
between 5.30 and six?

22:02.704 --> 22:03.756
Thanks, fellas.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.764
See you Thursday.
All right, bye.

22:05.764 --> 22:08.716
Oh, my dominoes gang.
How did you get on?

22:08.716 --> 22:11.728
Patrice confirmed
Harrison has a few money worries.

22:11.728 --> 22:15.764
He also said that he can't say for
sure he saw him on the harbour-side

22:15.764 --> 22:17.716
between 5.30 and six.

22:17.716 --> 22:19.704
Interesting. Well, I think I might
have an idea

22:19.704 --> 22:20.716
about his money troubles.

22:20.716 --> 22:21.760
Oh?

22:21.760 --> 22:25.724
My guys think he owes money
to a local loan shark.

22:25.724 --> 22:28.748
We've been trying to find Pee-wee
Paul for nearly three months.

22:28.748 --> 22:32.784
There's a Guadeloupe arrest warrant
out for him, for ABH at a house
party.

22:32.784 --> 22:35.732
So Pee-wee's a bit
of a slippery customer, is he?

22:35.732 --> 22:39.704
Lots of people owe him money,
so he has plenty of places to hide.

22:39.704 --> 22:42.720
Well, he may know something we
don't, so let's see if we can track
him down.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.724
Any joy with that phone number you
found in the victim's room?

22:45.724 --> 22:49.708
Er, yes, it's the number
for the Maritime Authority Office,

22:49.708 --> 22:51.744
but I can't get through to them
at the moment.

22:51.744 --> 22:52.772
What do they do?

22:52.772 --> 22:55.732
Oh, they license the fishing boats,

22:55.732 --> 22:56.780
monitor their catches,

22:56.780 --> 22:58.776
make sure the boats are seaworthy.

22:58.776 --> 23:01.700
And why would Tiana have their
number in her bedroom?

23:02.752 --> 23:05.732
Keep trying, JP.

23:11.716 --> 23:12.740
Who is this?

23:12.740 --> 23:13.792
Oh, so I checked with Louise,

23:13.792 --> 23:17.792
and it's Tiana Palmer's birth
mother, Marie Forrest.

23:17.792 --> 23:20.780
It was with Tiana
when she was left at the orphanage.

23:21.796 --> 23:24.752
And has she been in touch since
then?No.

23:25.768 --> 23:26.784
Right.

23:26.784 --> 23:28.788
OK, where were we?

23:28.788 --> 23:31.712
Right, what about her computer?

23:31.712 --> 23:33.796
Not much here either. I mean,
she deleted all of her history.

23:33.796 --> 23:36.748
But I did find one weird thing,
though.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.704
Oh?

23:38.704 --> 23:41.776
Well, she e-mailed herself
a lot of photos on Saturday.

23:41.776 --> 23:43.712
What of?

23:43.712 --> 23:45.780
Well, that's the thing.
There were a lot of selfies,

23:45.780 --> 23:50.732
but right in the middle, there were
photos of the harbour at Belle Mer.

23:50.732 --> 23:52.772
Who takes snaps of somewhere they've
lived for the whole of their life?

23:52.772 --> 23:53.780
Well, that's what I thought.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.724
Well, let's just add that

23:55.724 --> 23:58.736
to the list of things in this case
that don't make any sense.

24:31.748 --> 24:32.772
SOBS

24:32.772 --> 24:34.772
And you're sure you've never seen
this man before, no?

24:36.716 --> 24:37.720
OK.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.736
SIGHS
All right.

24:41.736 --> 24:42.780
This is ridiculous, Ruby.

24:42.780 --> 24:44.792
How can no-one have seen Pee-wee?

24:44.792 --> 24:47.740
Well, if he knows there's a warrant
out for his arrest,

24:47.740 --> 24:49.756
he's not going to make himself
easy to find.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.720
Yeah, but the man's a loan shark.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.744
Surely someone hates him enough
to give him up, no?

24:54.772 --> 24:55.780
EXHALES DEEPLY

24:57.788 --> 24:58.792
So...

24:59.792 --> 25:02.700
...you still got the hots
for our murder suspect?

25:02.700 --> 25:04.744
No. Yes.

25:04.744 --> 25:06.736
And before you say it, JP,

25:06.736 --> 25:09.716
I know that it's not professional,

25:09.716 --> 25:11.792
but not everyone
can be perfect like you, can we?

25:11.792 --> 25:14.764
EXHALES DEEPLY

25:14.764 --> 25:16.704
Well...
CLEARS THROAT

25:18.796 --> 25:24.704
...what if I was to say
that I met my Rosey while on duty

25:24.704 --> 25:25.768
and working a case?
No!

25:28.752 --> 25:29.784
WHISPERS:No way.

25:29.784 --> 25:32.700
Yes. It's very, very true.

25:32.700 --> 25:35.720
I mean, I originally did know her
from school,

25:35.720 --> 25:37.792
but I don't even think she noticed
me back then.

25:38.796 --> 25:42.768
Until all these years later,
she sees you in your police uniform,

25:42.768 --> 25:44.796
and all her bells started ringing...

25:44.796 --> 25:47.708
It's just sweet, JP.

25:47.708 --> 25:49.716
But that's not my point, Ruby.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.728
The thing is,
it's not about us being perfect.

25:53.732 --> 25:56.732
You see, all the other stuff,
they're going to crop up.

25:57.732 --> 26:01.760
But when we're working,
we concentrate more on the job.

26:03.764 --> 26:06.780
OK?
OK.

26:06.780 --> 26:09.776
I always knew you had a naughty side
to you, JP.

26:09.776 --> 26:13.716
Dating a suspect in a murder case,
look at you!

26:13.716 --> 26:15.772
Bad man!
All right!
SHE LAUGHS

26:15.772 --> 26:17.724
Yes, sire.

26:17.724 --> 26:19.776
LAUGHS
Having fun?

26:19.776 --> 26:21.732
Oh, yeah, they're a lovely bunch.

26:21.732 --> 26:24.752
Give you their last penny, soon as
it's stolen off of somebody else.

26:24.752 --> 26:26.716
And did they knew where Pee-wee was?

26:26.716 --> 26:27.760
Oh, yes.

26:31.776 --> 26:35.712
Odile! How the devil are you?

26:35.712 --> 26:37.776
You'll be back at the bingo on
Saturday?Yes, of course.

26:37.776 --> 26:38.784
Great!

26:38.784 --> 26:39.796
Hit me.

26:39.796 --> 26:41.772
Go on, then. Go on.

26:43.740 --> 26:45.788
You'll be Pee-wee, I assume. Police.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.712
Get the money!

26:49.712 --> 26:50.716
MEN SHOUT

26:58.768 --> 27:02.704
Good job I was the under-nines
cross-country champion.

27:24.792 --> 27:27.748
HE PANTS HEAVILY

27:36.752 --> 27:37.772
Agh!

27:41.788 --> 27:43.776
PHONE VIBRATES

27:43.776 --> 27:44.780
Sarge?

27:44.780 --> 27:47.712
PANTING
Are you running?

27:47.712 --> 27:48.792
Stay where you are!

27:48.792 --> 27:50.788
I think he must be coming your way.

27:50.788 --> 27:52.788
Look!

27:52.788 --> 27:55.784
That isn't a man, that's a mountain!

27:55.784 --> 27:57.720
SIGHS
All right.

27:58.732 --> 28:00.716
Pee-wee!

28:00.716 --> 28:01.796
Stop!

28:01.796 --> 28:03.780
We just want to chat!

28:09.784 --> 28:12.736
Hey, hey, hey. OK, wait, stop. Stop,
stop!

28:12.736 --> 28:13.740
Agh!

28:13.740 --> 28:15.748
Come on, get up!

28:15.748 --> 28:17.740
YELLS

28:17.740 --> 28:19.700
Aaah!

28:19.700 --> 28:21.708
Hang on, girl!
Hang on!

28:21.708 --> 28:22.796
Help me, I can't get off!

28:22.796 --> 28:25.700
Hey, put her down!

28:25.700 --> 28:26.740
No, no, no, no!

28:26.740 --> 28:28.700
Ruby!

28:32.788 --> 28:34.768
Are you OK?
Ruby's fine,

28:34.768 --> 28:36.760
but I don't think he can swim.

28:39.740 --> 28:40.796
Stop!

28:56.740 --> 28:58.720
SNIFFLES

29:05.792 --> 29:08.796
What we have here, Pee-wee,
is a simple choice.

29:08.796 --> 29:10.752
Be charged with resisting arrest

29:10.752 --> 29:12.732
and assault on a police officer

29:12.732 --> 29:14.776
or a bacon sandwich.

29:15.776 --> 29:18.792
Now, how about you tell me
everything you know
about Harrison Green?

29:20.732 --> 29:21.740
Deal.

29:24.744 --> 29:28.708
Oh, is there any chance
that Louise can get Tiana's tips?

29:28.708 --> 29:30.708
She needs all the help she can get.

29:30.708 --> 29:32.740
I mean, I wouldn't ask, but...
No, of course.

29:32.740 --> 29:35.776
But they wouldn't be that much help,
it was only 10.

29:35.776 --> 29:38.716
Ten?!

29:38.716 --> 29:40.788
Oh, she said she had over 650

29:40.788 --> 29:42.724
the day before she died.

29:42.724 --> 29:44.756
This makes 650!

29:44.756 --> 29:45.772
PATRICE CHUCKLES

29:45.772 --> 29:48.760
It's your smile, gold-plated.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.796
OK, leave it with me,
I'll tell the Inspector.

29:50.796 --> 29:52.752
OK.
OK?

29:55.776 --> 29:56.796
Morning.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.780
BOTH: Morning, Sarge.

29:58.780 --> 30:03.720
Sir, according to Patrice,
Tiana had over 600 in her tips box.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.776
And how much did we find in her
locker?About ten and some coins.

30:06.776 --> 30:10.732
Well, now, that makes what I just
heard even MORE interesting.

30:10.732 --> 30:14.796
Harrison Green has just paid Pee-wee
an instalment of 600.

30:14.796 --> 30:17.740
Apparently, he's got a gambling
problem. He's an addict.

30:17.740 --> 30:19.736
Harrison? A gambler?

30:19.736 --> 30:20.748
What, you didn't know that?

30:20.748 --> 30:23.740
No, I didn't, and I don't think
Patrice does either.

30:23.740 --> 30:24.784
Yeah, not a very successful one.

30:24.784 --> 30:27.772
That's why he has so many credit
cards. Wait till you hear this.

30:27.772 --> 30:30.724
Last week, he bet his family's
water-taxi business,

30:30.724 --> 30:31.760
and he lost it!

30:31.760 --> 30:34.788
Pee-wee bailed him out for a price,
now he's in it up to his neck.

30:34.788 --> 30:37.716
You think Harrison stole from Tiana.

30:37.716 --> 30:40.700
Well, we should ask him,
don't you think?

30:44.708 --> 30:47.704
She said if I didn't tell her the
truth, we were finished.

30:48.756 --> 30:49.760
So?

30:51.716 --> 30:52.760
I told her everything.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.764
And did you tell her

30:53.764 --> 30:56.728
that you almost gambled away
your family's business?

30:56.728 --> 30:57.732
We spoke to Pee-wee.

30:59.788 --> 31:01.704
Like I said...

31:02.724 --> 31:03.768
...I told her everything.

31:03.768 --> 31:06.732
We spent all night talking about it.

31:06.732 --> 31:07.764
She forgave me.

31:09.748 --> 31:11.788
Said we'd face everything together.

31:13.720 --> 31:14.744
Like a real couple.

31:14.744 --> 31:17.740
She told me to keep the tips
that I'd taken from her.

31:17.740 --> 31:20.748
Told me to use them towards paying
for the half of the house.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.728
Which you haven't actually done yet.

31:23.760 --> 31:26.708
We were going to go in together
the day after the festival.

31:26.708 --> 31:29.716
Harrison, is there anyone
who can verify

31:29.716 --> 31:32.716
exactly where you were
between 5.30 and 6pm

31:32.716 --> 31:33.788
on the day Tiana was killed?

31:33.788 --> 31:35.744
Yes.

31:35.744 --> 31:36.768
Patrice.

31:39.764 --> 31:42.712
Well, now, to be fair...

31:43.708 --> 31:45.748
...Patrice says he thinks
you were at the bar...

31:46.792 --> 31:48.756
...but he didn't actually
see you there.

31:48.756 --> 31:51.764
You think I killed her?

31:51.764 --> 31:54.712
SIGHS
No.

31:54.712 --> 31:55.784
No, I don't.

31:55.784 --> 31:58.712
But it's our job to find out
what happened to her.

31:58.712 --> 31:59.740
I loved her.

32:00.772 --> 32:03.704
You know that, Florence.

32:11.792 --> 32:13.724
You OK?

32:13.724 --> 32:14.728
What did they want?

32:14.728 --> 32:15.736
They think I killed her.

32:15.736 --> 32:17.716
What?! Don't be ridiculous!

32:17.716 --> 32:18.728
And you know what?

32:18.728 --> 32:20.752
It didn't help you saying
you never saw me here

32:20.752 --> 32:21.776
when she was getting on the boat.

32:21.776 --> 32:23.712
You know I was here!

32:23.712 --> 32:25.728
No, no, no, it wasn't like that.
Oh, no?

32:25.728 --> 32:27.760
Then how come it feels like
I got you on one side

32:27.760 --> 32:29.732
and your girlfriend on the other?

32:33.720 --> 32:34.744
I feel terrible.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.792
You mustn't, Florence,
you're doing your best.

32:36.792 --> 32:41.784
We're trying to be as thorough as we
can. We owe it to poor Tiana.

32:41.784 --> 32:43.716
Any news?

32:43.716 --> 32:44.796
Nothing new, sir.

32:48.784 --> 32:51.772
Well, maybe we should look
at the videos again.

32:58.732 --> 33:02.772
So, this was taken at 5.47pm.

33:02.772 --> 33:05.712
We can see Tiana, clearly alive.

33:05.712 --> 33:08.704
The bay's completely empty,
nothing in sight.

33:08.704 --> 33:09.720
Not a boat nor man.

33:12.756 --> 33:16.796
Your video was taken at 5.50pm.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.760
She's a slumped forward there, look.

33:20.760 --> 33:23.744
So she's already been stabbed
before she came into view.

33:37.716 --> 33:40.764
It must've taken everything she had

33:40.764 --> 33:43.728
to steer herself around the headland

33:43.728 --> 33:44.792
to try and get some help.

33:46.724 --> 33:47.792
So...

33:47.792 --> 33:50.704
She left the jetty here
to start her journey.

33:50.704 --> 33:52.764
By the time she gets here,

33:52.764 --> 33:54.768
only three minutes later,

33:54.768 --> 33:56.780
she's been stabbed.

33:57.780 --> 34:00.744
Despite there being clearly
no other boats in the area

34:00.744 --> 34:02.728
and not a single person in the
water.

34:02.728 --> 34:04.780
And no time for her to stop on the
way.

34:04.780 --> 34:06.776
So just how the hell did our killer
do it?

34:06.776 --> 34:09.732
And, lest we forget,

34:09.732 --> 34:12.732
why was the loaf of bread taken
from her bag?

34:12.732 --> 34:14.732
Was it the killer who took it?

34:14.732 --> 34:16.752
I can't think why anyone else
would steal it.

34:16.752 --> 34:20.792
But why would they take it?
Souvenir?

34:20.792 --> 34:21.795
I assume we all agree

34:21.795 --> 34:24.760
this wasn't some bizarre bread
robbery that went wrong.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.764
Argh! I give up!

34:26.764 --> 34:29.752
Ah, now, don't say that, Ruby.

34:29.752 --> 34:30.755
We never give up.

34:30.755 --> 34:33.739
No, the photos
that she took at the harbour.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.784
I mean, they're just so out of
place. Look at this. Selfie.

34:36.784 --> 34:39.752
Selfie. Selfie. Lobster pot?

34:42.716 --> 34:43.768
Florence, your dad's a fisherman.

34:43.768 --> 34:45.780
Anything special from these photos
you can see?

34:47.712 --> 34:49.744
Hmm. It's a trawling net.

34:49.744 --> 34:52.752
A bottom trawler. You see those
wheels?

34:52.752 --> 34:54.739
They drag the net across the seabed,

34:54.739 --> 34:55.760
smashing coral,

34:55.760 --> 34:58.716
destroying everything in its path.

34:58.716 --> 34:59.720
It's illegal.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.768
And what happens
if you're caught using one of these?

35:01.768 --> 35:02.792
Huge fine,

35:02.792 --> 35:04.716
prison in some cases,

35:04.716 --> 35:07.708
but either way, they'd never be able
to fish again.

35:08.772 --> 35:11.728
So if somebody was illegal trawling,

35:11.728 --> 35:12.792
and Tiana became aware of it.

35:12.792 --> 35:15.792
And that's why she had the number
for the Maritime Authority.

35:15.792 --> 35:17.788
Yes, JP.

35:17.788 --> 35:21.704
And killing someone to save yourself
from prison,

35:21.704 --> 35:23.756
well, that's a better motive
than we have so far.

35:24.776 --> 35:28.740
The last person to see the victim
alive runs her own fishing boat.

35:29.752 --> 35:31.736
Nelly Dubois.

35:31.736 --> 35:33.708
OK, well, thank you very much.

35:33.708 --> 35:34.728
Bye-bye.

35:40.780 --> 35:42.744
Well, how'd you get on?

35:42.744 --> 35:44.732
JP was amazing.

35:44.732 --> 35:46.792
I swear, he morphed into, like,
Denzel Washington or something.

35:46.792 --> 35:48.704
Even I believed him.

35:48.704 --> 35:50.740
Chief, I just told her that we had
reports

35:50.740 --> 35:52.736
of someone using a bottom trawler
on the reef,

35:52.736 --> 35:54.752
and so, could she keep an eye out
for us?

35:54.752 --> 35:56.736
She acted like she was horrified.

35:56.736 --> 35:58.744
See you.
Oh! She's on the move.

36:09.700 --> 36:10.776
JP, Ruby, you check the hut.

36:10.776 --> 36:12.760
Florence and I will follow her.

36:21.776 --> 36:24.704
Hello, Nelly.

36:26.792 --> 36:28.772
Look, it's not what looks like.

36:28.772 --> 36:29.776
Hm.

36:30.776 --> 36:33.760
Looks like you're using an illegal
trawling net to catch fish.

36:34.788 --> 36:35.792
SIGHS

36:35.792 --> 36:37.764
OK, so it is what it looks like.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.704
So, why do it?

36:43.716 --> 36:45.724
Look, I come from a fishing family.

36:45.724 --> 36:47.772
You know, my dad fishes,
my three brothers fish,

36:47.772 --> 36:49.716
my five uncles fish,

36:49.716 --> 36:51.784
and all I've ever heard
is that it's a man's job.

36:51.784 --> 36:53.780
You know,
that girls should be in the kitchen,

36:53.780 --> 36:55.704
you know, cooking the fish,

36:55.704 --> 36:57.700
not out on the water catching them.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.700
And you thought you'd prove them
wrong.

36:59.700 --> 37:00.756
I DID prove them wrong.

37:02.708 --> 37:04.716
Just until the last couple of
months,

37:04.716 --> 37:06.700
when my catches started to drop.

37:06.700 --> 37:09.760
I was coming home empty
and having to watch them coming back

37:09.760 --> 37:12.704
bursting at the seams.

37:12.704 --> 37:15.776
It must be extra hard being a woman
working on your own.

37:15.776 --> 37:17.748
It's no harder for me than anyone
else.

37:17.748 --> 37:19.748
I had a run of bad luck, that's all.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.712
How did you know?

37:23.712 --> 37:24.776
A photo Tiana took.

37:27.708 --> 37:28.712
Tiana knew?

37:30.704 --> 37:31.776
She didn't speak to you about it?

37:33.728 --> 37:34.732
No.

37:35.732 --> 37:37.752
No, she never said anything.

37:40.736 --> 37:41.780
Hold on, you...

37:41.780 --> 37:44.776
...you can't think I had anything to
do with her death.

37:44.776 --> 37:47.704
Well, if she did know about it
and she reported you,

37:47.704 --> 37:48.744
you could have gone to prison.

37:48.744 --> 37:51.732
And brought shame
on the rest of your family.

37:51.732 --> 37:52.784
Quite a motive.

37:54.756 --> 37:56.704
SIGHS

38:02.704 --> 38:03.708
What a day.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.700
I think I need a very cold beer.

38:14.756 --> 38:15.796
What's happened?

38:18.776 --> 38:21.780
Is this what it's going to be like
being married to a police officer?

38:29.716 --> 38:31.788
Harrison told me what you said to
him.

38:31.788 --> 38:33.756
That I said I couldn't vouch for
him.

38:33.756 --> 38:35.768
I was doing my job.

38:35.768 --> 38:37.776
What, by using the things
I told you in confidence?

38:37.776 --> 38:40.704
No, no, you didn't tell me
"in confidence".

38:40.704 --> 38:41.748
It wasn't pillow talk, OK?

38:41.748 --> 38:43.736
I was interviewing you
about a murder,

38:43.736 --> 38:45.724
the murder of someone
you cared about!

38:45.724 --> 38:46.760
He thinks I betrayed him!

38:46.760 --> 38:47.792
Did you tell me the truth?

38:47.792 --> 38:49.756
Of course.
Then how can that be wrong?

38:49.756 --> 38:52.756
Harrison is not a killer.
I've known him all my life.

38:52.756 --> 38:55.724
There isn't a violent bone
in his body.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.760
He's good. He's kind, gentle.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.764
You can't seriously think he killed
Tiana.

38:59.764 --> 39:00.792
Right now?

39:02.768 --> 39:03.792
I don't know.

39:07.792 --> 39:09.736
Patrice.

39:21.764 --> 39:22.768
There you are.

39:29.712 --> 39:33.792
A month before Kathleen and I got
married, we nearly split up.

39:33.792 --> 39:35.792
It was her birthday, you see.

39:35.792 --> 39:38.760
I had forgotten to get her
a birthday present.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.784
Well, I didn't forget exactly.

39:40.784 --> 39:44.796
I was on a murder inquiry in
Reading, at a motorway service
station.

39:44.796 --> 39:47.700
Well, there wasn't much choice.

39:47.700 --> 39:49.708
What did you get her?

39:52.772 --> 39:54.772
A get well card,

39:54.772 --> 39:57.768
um, a toy monkey - yes -

39:57.768 --> 40:00.776
and a neck cushion.

40:00.776 --> 40:02.756
And she wasn't pleased?

40:02.756 --> 40:04.776
No, she was apoplectic.

40:04.776 --> 40:06.716
Yeah.

40:07.780 --> 40:11.704
And the funny thing is,
it wasn't the presents so much.

40:11.704 --> 40:13.732
The thing that upset her
was where I bought them.

40:14.788 --> 40:18.744
That I wouldn't stop working
for five minutes and put her first.

40:20.712 --> 40:22.776
She thought that was a sign,
you see,

40:22.776 --> 40:25.784
that the job I do would always be
more important to me than her.

40:25.784 --> 40:27.752
I'm sure that wasn't true.

40:27.752 --> 40:30.708
We stayed up until sunrise...

40:31.724 --> 40:32.792
...just talking.

40:32.792 --> 40:34.720
And by the end of it,

40:34.720 --> 40:37.756
we knew each other a lot better
than we ever did before.

40:40.724 --> 40:43.724
Patrice must be worried sick
about Harrison, that's all.

40:43.724 --> 40:47.796
He'll sleep on it
and see he's being unreasonable.

40:47.796 --> 40:49.744
And what if he doesn't?

40:49.744 --> 40:52.752
Well, then you have to stay up
until sunrise talking about it

40:52.752 --> 40:53.756
until he does!

40:55.732 --> 40:56.792
Yeah.

41:02.708 --> 41:05.708
Well, I think I'm not cut
out to be married.

41:05.708 --> 41:06.796
No-one's cut out to be married.

41:06.796 --> 41:10.748
You sort of have to just bend
yourself into shape.

41:10.748 --> 41:14.724
Yeah, but, hm...
I like my independence.

41:14.724 --> 41:16.772
Yeah, but you can still be
independent,

41:16.772 --> 41:18.732
just with somebody else.

41:19.756 --> 41:20.788
But I'm happy being single.

41:20.788 --> 41:21.792
Good!

41:21.792 --> 41:24.792
How can you be happy being married
if you're not happy being single?

41:24.792 --> 41:26.708
What?!

41:26.708 --> 41:28.748
Sorry, but what does that mean?

41:28.748 --> 41:30.776
I have no idea.
It's the beer talking.

41:30.776 --> 41:31.784
Oh.

41:35.788 --> 41:37.772
Do you love Patrice?

41:40.776 --> 41:42.732
Yes, I do.

41:42.732 --> 41:47.716
Can you imagine a life
that doesn't include Patrice?

41:51.780 --> 41:53.736
No.

41:53.736 --> 41:54.756
Well, there you go.

41:54.756 --> 41:59.744
From such a little thing - acorn -

41:59.744 --> 42:03.748
does the mighty oak of marriage
grow.

42:03.748 --> 42:06.780
The mighty oak of marriage?

42:06.780 --> 42:09.764
Yeah.
OK. OK.

42:11.712 --> 42:16.712
Life's not something to be scared of
or worried about.

42:17.796 --> 42:20.776
It's something you grab
with both hands.

42:20.776 --> 42:22.784
Yep.

42:22.784 --> 42:26.796
Which kind of answers my next
question.

42:26.796 --> 42:28.736
Which is?

42:28.736 --> 42:32.736
To refill...

42:32.736 --> 42:34.748
...or to call a cab?

42:35.784 --> 42:38.712
No contest.

42:38.712 --> 42:39.724
Thank you.

42:44.716 --> 42:46.792
To grabbing life with both hands.

42:49.796 --> 42:53.732
Ah, cheers.

43:25.712 --> 43:27.776
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

43:27.776 --> 43:30.720
Morning.
GROANS

43:32.728 --> 43:34.756
Are you suffering?

43:34.756 --> 43:35.780
No, I'm fine.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.732
Just someone's taken all the liquid
out of my body.

43:38.732 --> 43:42.700
Well, I got you a hot sweet coffee,

43:42.700 --> 43:46.736
and Catherine has made you
a bacon sandwich with brown sauce,

43:46.736 --> 43:47.768
whatever that is.

43:47.768 --> 43:50.796
Well, bless her, but I don't think
I'm ready for food just yet.

43:50.796 --> 43:52.724
OK.
Morning!

43:52.724 --> 43:53.772
Morning, sir. Sarge.

43:53.772 --> 43:55.752
Morning.

43:55.752 --> 43:56.772
All right.

43:56.772 --> 43:58.720
Is he all right?

43:58.720 --> 44:00.724
I think he's a little hungover.

44:00.724 --> 44:04.748
If you guys could take over
until my face stops hurting...

44:04.748 --> 44:08.788
OK, so our victim is Tiana Palmer,

44:08.788 --> 44:12.704
murdered on the sea
while playing Mama D'Mer

44:12.704 --> 44:13.756
at the Belle Mer Mahi Mahi festival.

44:13.756 --> 44:16.728
Tiana Palmer was last seen alive

44:16.728 --> 44:19.756
at 5.47pm, leaving the old jetty,

44:19.756 --> 44:22.732
which was close to the Belle Mer
headland.

44:22.732 --> 44:27.772
She was next seen at 5.50,
as she rounded the headland.

44:27.772 --> 44:30.728
In the three minutes it took for her
to reach that point,

44:30.728 --> 44:32.792
she was stabbed once,
in the chest here,

44:32.792 --> 44:35.764
yet we have no
idea how our killer managed

44:35.764 --> 44:39.712
to somehow board her moving boat
out at sea

44:39.712 --> 44:40.764
and commit the murder.

44:40.764 --> 44:41.780
JACK GROANS

44:41.780 --> 44:46.764
Sir? Any thoughts happening over
there?

44:46.764 --> 44:48.736
What?

44:48.736 --> 44:50.716
Yes.

44:50.716 --> 44:51.736
Yes, I do have a thought.

44:53.708 --> 44:57.700
I am thinking I will chance my arm
with that bacon sandwich,

44:57.700 --> 44:58.724
if you don't mind.

45:00.772 --> 45:02.792
Thank you, Florence.

45:09.704 --> 45:10.780
Er...

45:12.704 --> 45:16.768
...what's happened to Inspector
Mooney? He's frozen into a statue.

45:16.768 --> 45:18.716
Sir, are you OK?

45:21.712 --> 45:22.772
All comes down to the bread.

45:22.772 --> 45:24.724
On the bacon sandwich?

45:24.724 --> 45:27.700
No, the bread in Tiana's bag.

45:27.700 --> 45:30.700
Or rather the bread
that WASN'T in Tiana's bag.

45:30.700 --> 45:31.752
But if someone gave her some bread,

45:31.752 --> 45:33.748
like you gave me this bacon butty,
Florence,

45:33.748 --> 45:36.704
well, then she'd have to take it,

45:36.704 --> 45:38.720
because Tiana didn't have any bread.

45:39.728 --> 45:41.700
Mama D'Mer!

45:41.700 --> 45:43.712
You got everything?

45:43.712 --> 45:45.748
We've got the rum and the flowers,
but no bread.

45:45.748 --> 45:47.704
That's odd.

45:50.704 --> 45:52.728
And, well, THAT'S how
she was killed!

45:54.732 --> 45:56.792
They just needed the opportunity,
that's all.

45:57.796 --> 46:00.728
It's on my phone.

46:00.728 --> 46:03.708
But she wouldn't do it
herself, why would she?

46:03.708 --> 46:04.788
OK, Nelly's phone,
have we still got it?

46:04.788 --> 46:06.776
Er, yes!

46:10.732 --> 46:11.784
Here.

46:11.784 --> 46:13.784
Right under our noses all the time.

46:13.784 --> 46:16.748
Ruby, I need you to do
some fingerprint checking for me.

46:16.748 --> 46:18.704
Quick as you can, please.
Yes.

46:18.704 --> 46:20.716
JP, where are the photos you took
of Tiana's bedroom?

46:20.716 --> 46:21.724
Ah.

46:22.776 --> 46:26.732
Yep, right here, sir.

46:26.732 --> 46:27.788
Right. Of course.

46:27.788 --> 46:29.720
Of course!

46:29.720 --> 46:30.728
Look how tidy it is.

46:30.728 --> 46:31.776
Florence, round them up, will you?

46:31.776 --> 46:33.764
And, Ruby, meet us there,
at Patrice's bar,

46:33.764 --> 46:35.776
as soon as you're done.
Yes, sir.

46:35.776 --> 46:37.768
Wait!

46:37.768 --> 46:39.784
Has anyone got any paracetamol?

46:47.788 --> 46:52.700
This case has been a bundle of
conundrums since the very start.

46:53.704 --> 46:54.732
A murder taking place

46:54.732 --> 46:56.756
on a boat impossible to get to
without being seen,

46:56.756 --> 47:01.708
a boat impossible to reach from
the sea without it getting wet,

47:01.708 --> 47:02.744
and all happening

47:02.744 --> 47:05.724
in an impossibly tiny window
of opportunity.

47:05.724 --> 47:07.780
The biggest conundrum of all -

47:07.780 --> 47:11.708
the murder of someone
who everyone loved.

47:11.708 --> 47:13.712
Genuinely loved.

47:14.736 --> 47:17.724
But there's Tiana's mother,

47:17.724 --> 47:19.792
who thinks
she's about to lose her daughter,

47:19.792 --> 47:22.716
driven to the brink
by the fear of abandonment.

47:24.732 --> 47:26.760
And her best friend,

47:26.760 --> 47:28.796
guilty of illegal trawling,

47:28.796 --> 47:30.776
devastating the ocean floor,

47:30.776 --> 47:33.796
something she knew
Tiana would find unforgivable.

47:35.796 --> 47:39.792
In fact, it was something we now
know she was about to report.

47:39.792 --> 47:41.736
And her boyfriend.

47:41.736 --> 47:43.760
Her childhood sweetheart.

47:43.760 --> 47:46.780
The man who stole money from her
to help clear his gambling debts.

47:46.780 --> 47:49.744
I told you already. Tiana and I, we
talked about it. We sorted it out.

47:49.744 --> 47:50.764
Oh, yes, that's right.

47:50.764 --> 47:53.728
You told Florence here that you were
about to move in together.

47:53.728 --> 47:54.784
Yes, the day after
she was Mama D'Mer,

47:54.784 --> 47:56.784
we were going to put everything
else behind us.

47:56.784 --> 47:59.732
Well, now, you see,
I think that's half true.

47:59.732 --> 48:02.776
I think Tiana had put everything
behind her,

48:02.776 --> 48:05.764
and I think she finished with you
when she found out about your
gambling

48:05.764 --> 48:07.756
and that you'd stolen money from
her.Rubbish!

48:07.756 --> 48:10.708
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

48:10.708 --> 48:12.708
My officers checked her bedroom.

48:12.708 --> 48:16.712
And I've just studied the
photographs - there isn't a single
shoe out of place.

48:16.712 --> 48:17.772
It certainly doesn't look like the
kind of room

48:17.772 --> 48:20.780
that someone was planning to move
out of a day later.

48:20.780 --> 48:23.772
No. The simple truth is

48:23.772 --> 48:26.796
Tiana realised she didn't know the
man she was about to move in with.

48:26.796 --> 48:30.728
And relationships were strained
to breaking point with her mother,

48:30.728 --> 48:32.708
so she had no-one to confide in.

48:32.708 --> 48:34.736
Patrice, you were a good boss,

48:34.736 --> 48:36.728
but she knew
how close you were to Harrison.

48:36.728 --> 48:37.776
She couldn't talk to you either.

48:37.776 --> 48:39.788
I don't have to listen to this.
Er, yes, you do.

48:47.776 --> 48:49.728
But her big day was coming.

48:49.728 --> 48:54.700
She was going to be Mama D'Mer
at the Mahi Mahi festival.

48:54.700 --> 48:56.796
And I think she told you that you'd
keep all this to yourselves,

48:56.796 --> 48:59.732
all your guilty secrets,

48:59.732 --> 49:02.764
and she wouldn't tell anyone
until after the event.

49:02.764 --> 49:04.716
And that's why you had to kill her.

49:05.744 --> 49:07.796
Because you knew on the following
day you'd lose everything.

49:07.796 --> 49:11.736
This is ridiculous!
How could he possibly have done it?!

49:11.736 --> 49:14.760
Hear me out, Patrice, please.
Please.

49:15.776 --> 49:16.788
How indeed?

49:18.708 --> 49:19.764
Well, first of all, no-one knows

49:19.764 --> 49:22.784
how long a journey by sea will take
better than a water-taxi driver.

49:22.784 --> 49:25.740
You even helpfully told us
how long it would take.

49:25.740 --> 49:26.772
Exactly.

49:26.772 --> 49:29.736
The tide was against her a little
bit.

49:30.796 --> 49:32.736
Three minutes, maybe.

49:32.736 --> 49:35.704
Which means there was no time to do
it.

49:35.704 --> 49:38.720
It was impossible!True. Or at least
that's what you wanted us to think.

49:39.732 --> 49:41.720
But in the end, there's only one
solution.

49:41.720 --> 49:43.776
It didn't only happen
in three minutes.

49:43.776 --> 49:47.704
You bought yourself
the extra five minutes you needed

49:47.704 --> 49:50.756
by changing the clock
on Nelly's phone

49:50.756 --> 49:53.736
so it would look like the video
was recorded later than it was.

49:53.736 --> 49:54.796
Now, I'm not sure when you did this,

49:54.796 --> 49:57.700
but Nelly often leaves her bag
unattended,

49:57.700 --> 49:58.748
and I've just checked her phone -

49:58.748 --> 50:00.724
it's still running five minutes
fast.

50:00.724 --> 50:01.784
Right under our noses all the time.

50:08.736 --> 50:11.788
You forgot to wipe your fingerprints
off Nelly's phone.

50:11.788 --> 50:16.708
Is there any reason why his
fingerprints should be on your
phone, Nelly?

50:16.708 --> 50:17.720
No.

50:18.788 --> 50:22.744
Well, that's wasn't the only thing
you did to prepare, was it?

50:22.744 --> 50:24.772
On the day of the festival,

50:24.772 --> 50:27.780
you had to remove a loaf of bread
from Tiana's bag,

50:27.780 --> 50:29.764
the one she was using
for Mama D'Mer.

50:29.764 --> 50:32.760
I think you slipped away from
the bar at the exact moment

50:32.760 --> 50:36.756
you knew that Nelly here
would be seeing Tiana on her way.

50:36.756 --> 50:39.776
And as soon as Nelly was out of
sight, you called Tiana back to the
shore.

50:39.776 --> 50:41.736
But you needed a reason, a pretext.

50:42.784 --> 50:44.716
Tiana!

50:44.716 --> 50:46.744
You forgot the bread!

50:46.744 --> 50:48.748
Tiana!

50:48.748 --> 50:50.732
Now, the video on Nelly's phone,

50:50.732 --> 50:52.792
it showed her leaving at 5.47,

50:52.792 --> 50:56.724
but in fact, because you changed
the time on her phone,

50:56.724 --> 50:58.704
it was really only 5.42.

50:59.716 --> 51:02.728
That's how you bought yourself the
time you needed to commit murder.

51:09.788 --> 51:12.740
Ah!

51:15.736 --> 51:17.716
You stabbed her.

51:24.712 --> 51:26.744
But you didn't quite kill her.
She got away.

51:26.744 --> 51:29.748
She knew she needed to get
to where there were people.

51:31.728 --> 51:35.736
And I believe that she used
every last bit of energy she had

51:35.736 --> 51:37.740
to make her way around
that headland,

51:37.740 --> 51:41.700
where she thought
someone might be able to help her.

51:41.700 --> 51:44.752
Meanwhile, you had to ensure
that you were at the harbour-side

51:44.752 --> 51:46.792
when the boat came in,
whatever happened.

51:46.792 --> 51:49.708
And you acted as if nothing had
happened.My baby!

51:49.708 --> 51:50.716
She get off all right?

51:50.716 --> 51:52.760
Yeah, everything all good.
Go on, Ti!

51:54.720 --> 51:58.764
As she died, you thought your
secrets would die with her,

51:58.764 --> 52:00.764
that your family would never
discover

52:00.764 --> 52:03.788
you destroyed the business
through your gambling addiction

52:03.788 --> 52:06.728
and that you were a thief,

52:06.728 --> 52:08.768
and you'd get to play
the grieving boyfriend

52:08.768 --> 52:10.792
instead of having the humiliation

52:10.792 --> 52:13.792
of being dumped by the village girl
who everyone loved.

52:15.756 --> 52:16.788
Tell him it's not true.

52:19.708 --> 52:20.736
Tell him!

52:22.732 --> 52:24.752
You don't understand.

52:26.724 --> 52:28.792
JP, if you could do the honours,
please.

52:28.792 --> 52:33.720
Harrison Green, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Tiana Palmer.

52:33.720 --> 52:38.708
You don't have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...

52:50.740 --> 52:52.780
I don't know what to do, he's so
upset.

52:52.780 --> 52:54.744
Well, you just go to him, Florence.

52:54.744 --> 52:55.784
We'll deal with this, OK?

52:55.784 --> 52:57.712
Thank you.

53:02.744 --> 53:05.716
Just listen to me, please.

53:05.716 --> 53:07.748
Look, I know he didn't do this.

53:07.748 --> 53:08.784
We need to do something!

53:11.704 --> 53:12.764
Do you know what's been going on?

53:16.716 --> 53:17.740
Then we need to talk.

53:18.788 --> 53:21.752
Yeah, I know it. 20 minutes.

53:24.716 --> 53:25.796
Are you OK?

53:25.796 --> 53:27.728
Yeah.

53:27.728 --> 53:28.752
Look...

53:30.716 --> 53:31.764
I'm sorry.

53:31.764 --> 53:33.760
I know this isn't your fault.

53:33.760 --> 53:35.752
Well, can we talk about this?

53:35.752 --> 53:39.704
Yes. Just...not right now.

53:39.704 --> 53:40.744
There's something I need to do.

53:40.744 --> 53:41.768
What?

53:41.768 --> 53:43.724
I'll tell you later.

54:01.704 --> 54:03.732
Nelly, could I borrow a truck?

54:03.732 --> 54:04.748
It won't be long.

54:04.748 --> 54:06.796
Er...sure.

54:24.716 --> 54:26.704
PHONE RINGS

54:30.748 --> 54:34.736
Sir, I have just heard Patrice
talking on the phone

54:34.736 --> 54:35.772
to someone about Harrison.

54:35.772 --> 54:37.776
He's arranged to meet them.

54:37.776 --> 54:40.752
I think something's going on.

54:40.752 --> 54:42.708
I'm following Patrice in his car,

54:42.708 --> 54:44.704
and we are heading north,
out of Belle Mer.

54:44.704 --> 54:46.728
Please, please call me.

56:07.720 --> 56:08.736
Patrice?

56:19.784 --> 56:21.740
Patrice!

56:31.712 --> 56:32.744
It's me!

56:33.776 --> 56:38.756
Look, whatever it is, I can help,
OK?

56:38.756 --> 56:40.776
Just... Just talk to me.

56:43.796 --> 56:46.712
Do you know something about
Harrison?

56:47.788 --> 56:49.792
METALLIC CLANG

56:49.792 --> 56:51.744
