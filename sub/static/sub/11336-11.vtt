WEBVTT

00:13.180 --> 00:15.147
If you want to get
out of here alive,

00:16.350 --> 00:20.119
then you're gonna tell me
what happened in New York.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.453
Spike, what's going on?
I need eyes in.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.189
Get up there with Jules.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.593
What do you want me to say?

00:27.595 --> 00:31.196
I will know the truth
when I hear it.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.266
Alpha One and Two, requesting
permission to enter, sir.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.634
We go through the skylight,
we'll spook her.

00:35.636 --> 00:36.769
She might use the knife.

00:36.771 --> 00:39.104
Oh, my... my God.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.572
What have I done?

00:40.574 --> 00:42.074
Boss, I can see this.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.575
You're not seeing it.
Sam's not seeing it.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.045
I can see it. We can be in there
within three seconds.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.679
We'll disarm her.
The knife is down. Repeat:

00:47.681 --> 00:49.048
the knife is down.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.216
We gotta go in, boss.
We gotta risk it.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.118
Duress the lady.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.319
Go, go, go, go.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.193
SARAH:
Do you see anything?

01:01.195 --> 01:05.330
Just give me
another minute here.

01:05.332 --> 01:06.799
The fearless explorer

01:06.801 --> 01:09.134
probing the uncharted depths.

01:09.136 --> 01:12.805
in a search for life.

01:12.807 --> 01:15.340
I know it's a little early, but
when we got the test came back

01:15.342 --> 01:16.275
and the results...

01:16.277 --> 01:18.377
She couldn't wait.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.378
I just couldn't wait.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.413
DOCTOR:
I'm sorry...

01:23.784 --> 01:26.151
Oh.

01:26.153 --> 01:29.221
No... It... But...
the-the test was positive?

01:29.223 --> 01:30.456
Maybe we misread the results.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.808
No, we didn't
misread the results.

01:32.809 --> 01:35.159
There was, there were two...
two very clear blue lines

01:35.162 --> 01:36.445
It was positive.

01:36.446 --> 01:37.729
Must have been
a false positive.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.098
It happens.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.167
Maybe... maybe you just
can't see anything

01:42.169 --> 01:43.368
'cause it's just too early.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.503
No.

01:44.505 --> 01:48.173
If... if there'd been
a pregnancy,

01:48.175 --> 01:49.274
I would have seen it.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.711
I'm very sorry.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.879
Look, uh...

01:53.881 --> 01:56.515
Why don't you get cleaned up?

01:56.517 --> 01:58.183
I'll be back in a minute,

01:58.185 --> 02:00.119
and, we'll, uh, we'll talk.
It's okay.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.187
We'll just schedule
something now,
No, no.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.189
so we don't get
too down about it.
No.

02:04.191 --> 02:05.858
No. Sarah...
Yeah.

02:05.860 --> 02:08.727
We'll just, um, just book
another appointment

02:08.729 --> 02:10.629
for one last treatment
next month. Okay?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.731
Sarah... It's been four months
of Clomid,

02:12.733 --> 02:18.270
nine IVF procedures over
the last three and a half years,

02:18.272 --> 02:21.273
and all that time, there's
only been one fertilization.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.725
But it took.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.176
I was pregnant
for four months.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.844
We were pregnant
for four months.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.813
Yes.
And the loss...

02:27.815 --> 02:29.281
was a shock
to your body.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.682
Look.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.354
Last month,

02:35.356 --> 02:38.891
we sat here in
this same spot,

02:38.893 --> 02:40.692
and I told you
that your chances

02:40.694 --> 02:44.730
were very, very slim,
and that I did not think

02:44.732 --> 02:47.166
that you should go forward
with another treatment.

02:47.168 --> 02:51.370
I'm sorry to be so blunt,
but in good conscience,

02:51.372 --> 02:55.440
I can't recommend that
you spend another $15,000.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.446
(door creaks)

03:01.448 --> 03:02.781
Okay, all clear.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.850
Not that I don't appreciate
a little excitement,

03:04.852 --> 03:06.752
but come on, I think
we're safe.

03:06.754 --> 03:10.389
You mind if I don't gamble
my career on what you think?

03:10.391 --> 03:11.941
Huh?
Unless one of
your neighbors

03:11.942 --> 03:13.492
works for the SRU,
it's not much of a gamble.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.227
Now, headquarters,
that's another story.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.996
I trust you have
an entry plan.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.764
Affirmative. I'm gonna drop
you off a few blocks away,

03:18.766 --> 03:20.465
park my vehicle at HQ,

03:20.467 --> 03:21.900
enter through the front.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.870
You're gonna wait a few minutes,
stealth through the rear.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.405
I was kidding.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.408
Yeah, I'm not.

03:29.410 --> 03:32.344
MAN:
Sarah, when you get home,

03:32.346 --> 03:34.446
can you see if I left my phone
on the counter?

03:34.448 --> 03:36.281
We're not giving up, right?

03:36.283 --> 03:37.282
We're not...

03:37.284 --> 03:40.285
Oh, for God's sake, Sarah, we...

03:40.287 --> 03:41.453
we're not doing it again.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.454
Why?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.822
We're not
doing it again.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.491
I'm sorry. I-I can't get
back on this roller coaster.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.794
I can't keep feeling like
every month is some sort of test

03:48.796 --> 03:49.828
that we have to pass...

03:49.830 --> 03:51.330
You know
that's not true.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.332
What else do you want
to throw away, hmm?

03:53.334 --> 03:55.867
I mean, what else
gets thrown out the window

03:55.869 --> 03:58.804
just in case maybe
this time we're lucky.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.572
What are you
talking about, Josh?

04:00.574 --> 04:03.475
Everything that we save,
sweetheart.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.578
Everything, everything
that we hoped for.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.981
You're the one
giving up on our hope.

04:13.621 --> 04:17.422
You threw away your work...
which you were damn good at.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.423
And we agreed.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.491
We made that decision together.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.726
Okay.
We agreed that that was

04:20.728 --> 04:21.760
the right thing to do.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.396
Because you wanted to relax.

04:24.398 --> 04:27.733
You wanted to relax and read
catalogs and dream of babies

04:27.735 --> 04:29.735
in a house
that we can't pay for anymore.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.737
I never said
I wanted that house.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.038
I don't need a big house.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.275
We'll move.
We'll get a smaller house.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.877
All our friends
who have babies

04:37.878 --> 04:39.478
you don't want
to see anymore.
That's not true.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.513
You can't go outside
because you're scared

04:41.515 --> 04:42.814
you're gonna see
another frickin' stroller.

04:42.816 --> 04:46.885
I went outside yesterday.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.690
Y-You went outside
yesterday?

04:51.692 --> 04:52.991
Yes.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.694
I've held your hand...

04:57.631 --> 04:59.531
I've stayed up
with you at night.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.417
I've dreamed with you.

05:01.418 --> 05:03.302
I've given up a lot
that I care about.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.537
I mean, I've done...

05:05.539 --> 05:07.606
everything that I can do,
but I-I...

05:11.445 --> 05:12.577
I-I can't
do this anymore.

05:12.579 --> 05:13.912
You can't do what?

05:13.914 --> 05:14.913
You know what?

05:14.915 --> 05:16.381
I-I should...

05:16.383 --> 05:17.416
I'm gonna go to work.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.850
No.
I have to go to work.

05:18.852 --> 05:19.951
What are
you saying?

05:19.953 --> 05:21.019
I have to go.
Josh!

05:21.021 --> 05:22.020
Sarah.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.056
Josh! G...

05:24.058 --> 05:25.324
Josh.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.659
(gasps)

05:27.661 --> 05:29.561
What are you saying?

05:29.563 --> 05:30.996
(sniffles)

05:30.998 --> 05:32.464
(sobbing)

05:32.466 --> 05:35.067
I told her--
line-dry only.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.902
She keeps putting
my pants in the dryer.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.404
Hold up. Hold up. Your mom
still does your laundry?

05:39.406 --> 05:41.406
Hey, she's Italian, okay?

05:41.408 --> 05:42.774
Try and stop her.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.192
Gentlemen.

05:44.193 --> 05:45.609
LOUIS:
Missed you at choir practice
last night, man.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.446
That's another round
you owe the boys.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.747
Don't let that add up.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.582
You know what?
I lay down for 20 minutes,

05:50.584 --> 05:52.851
I opened my eyes,
suddenly it was 6:00 a.m.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.486
I hate when that happens.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.688
Samtastic sleeping alone.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.457
What's this world coming to?

05:58.459 --> 05:59.624
(laughs)

05:59.626 --> 06:00.859
SAM:
Ed, we patrolling today?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.427
ED:
All right, listen up.

06:02.429 --> 06:03.528
The El Colera gang

06:03.530 --> 06:04.763
has three strongholds.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.998
We are gonna split up
and cover 'em all.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.500
Boss wants us out in five,

06:08.502 --> 06:10.001
so let's go, ladies.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.870
(birds singing)

06:36.397 --> 06:39.731
(yelling)

06:45.539 --> 06:47.806
(sobbing)

06:47.808 --> 06:50.742
(phone ringing)

06:50.744 --> 06:52.744
(sobbing continues)

06:52.746 --> 06:54.513
(phone continues ringing)

06:54.515 --> 06:56.581
Oh, he's not home!

06:56.583 --> 06:58.550
He's not home!

07:00.654 --> 07:02.721
(sighs)

07:02.723 --> 07:04.790
(phone ringing)

07:08.529 --> 07:10.629
(beeps)

07:10.631 --> 07:11.997
(mutters)

07:11.999 --> 07:13.999
(two beeps)

07:14.001 --> 07:16.067
(sighs)

07:16.069 --> 07:18.637
(beep)

07:21.508 --> 07:22.941
Oh, no.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.643
No.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.111
(beep)

07:26.113 --> 07:28.480
(loud breathing)

07:34.188 --> 07:37.522
(grunting)

07:37.524 --> 07:40.525
(beep)

07:40.527 --> 07:41.693
Oh!

07:42.663 --> 07:44.529
(grunts)

07:44.531 --> 07:46.598
(panting)

07:51.538 --> 07:54.072
(beeps)

08:00.981 --> 08:03.114
(phone chirps)

08:04.651 --> 08:06.852
So, you want to cook tonight?
Try your new barbecue?

08:06.854 --> 08:09.054
Relax. We're off.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.189
How did it go
with the guys this morning?

08:11.191 --> 08:12.657
Fine. Don't worry.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.025
Anyway, who cares what we do?

08:14.027 --> 08:16.595
Uh, the sarge, the chief,
the commander.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.896
The rules.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.631
All right, but the thing is...

08:19.633 --> 08:20.599
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.833
It's nobody's business.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.235
We're professionals.

08:23.237 --> 08:26.037
Absolutely. You are
utterly professional.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.240
Me, I'm just here
for the sexy sniper chicks.

08:28.242 --> 08:31.142
(garbled radio transmission)

08:31.144 --> 08:33.144
You doing okay?

08:33.146 --> 08:34.579
(garbled radio transmission)

08:34.581 --> 08:36.615
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.084
'Cause, uh, the other
day at the station...

08:39.086 --> 08:40.785
Oh, come on. Here we go.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.120
(garbled radio transmission)

08:42.122 --> 08:43.588
What?

08:43.590 --> 08:44.723
Look, I'm just saying.

08:44.725 --> 08:45.891
You look through
the scope,

08:45.893 --> 08:47.259
and you see things
that aren't there.

08:47.261 --> 08:48.827
Maybe you need a break
from the action.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.762
When was the last time
you had a day off?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.564
I don't need a day off.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.600
Hey, we could all use
a day off, Ed.

08:55.602 --> 08:56.935
All right,
thanks, Oprah.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.804
I forgot what a joy
it was to ride with you.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.239
Oh.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.308
(doorbell rings)

09:03.310 --> 09:05.944
(dog barking)

09:11.251 --> 09:13.618
(sighs)

09:15.622 --> 09:17.756
Hello.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.058
Hi. Um... Mrs. Scott?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.893
You must be Hannah.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.595
I'm, um...

09:23.597 --> 09:25.630
I write for...
<i> Wired Magazine.</i>

09:25.632 --> 09:27.065
I'm here to see Joshua?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.200
Mm-hmm. Of course. Come in.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.343
If this is a-a bad
time, I could...

09:38.345 --> 09:40.078
No. No, it's a good time.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.147
Please, come in. Sit down.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.950
You have a lovely home.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.918
Thank you.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.189
Would you, uh...?

09:51.191 --> 09:53.191
Would you like some tea?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.327
Sure. Thank you.

10:05.872 --> 10:08.273
He's, um...

10:08.275 --> 10:11.343
He's at work a-actually.

10:11.345 --> 10:12.711
(laughs)

10:12.713 --> 10:13.878
Oh.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.647
I'm sorry.
I thought he was here.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.316
I-I wanted to talk to you.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.952
I'm s...

10:20.954 --> 10:22.387
<i> You</i> texted me?

10:22.389 --> 10:24.322
Mm-hmm.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.795
I want to know
about you and-and him.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.366
How do you mean?

10:34.368 --> 10:37.936
I think you know what I mean.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.806
Do you know what?
I'm gonna go.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.209
I'm sorry that I...
that I bothered you.

10:44.211 --> 10:47.078
Please don't.
Excuse me.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.847
I-I have to...
Don't go.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.015
You let me go!

10:50.017 --> 10:52.050
Not until you
tell me the truth.
Oh!

10:54.087 --> 10:57.222
Look, I just...
I just want... I
just want the truth.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.690
Okay.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.092
So you stay until we talk. Okay?

11:01.094 --> 11:03.828
All right. Okay, we can talk.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.797
(grunts)

11:05.799 --> 11:07.132
I'm calling
the police!
Don't. No, don't!

11:07.134 --> 11:08.333
Put it down!

11:08.335 --> 11:10.135
Just stay...
Just stay away from me.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.970
No. No, don't do that.
Oh, my God. Help me.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.171
Put that down!

11:13.173 --> 11:17.042
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

11:50.043 --> 11:51.376
<i> Team One, gear up.</i>

11:51.378 --> 11:53.044
Hot call.
Possible home invasion,

11:53.046 --> 11:55.914
16 Lakerock Crescent.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.315
We're real close. Boss?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.484
Kira, what
did 54 Division give us?

11:59.486 --> 12:01.219
911 came in ten minutes ago.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.654
Dispatch flagged it.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.088
There's been a wave
of violent home invasions

12:04.091 --> 12:05.090
in the neighborhood.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.091
Underground Boys?

12:06.093 --> 12:07.325
Same grid. Copy that.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.160
Underground Boys?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.462
Four in the last two weeks,

12:10.464 --> 12:12.330
and all four came through
the basement windows.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.866
Last week, they found some woman
at home, tied her up

12:14.868 --> 12:15.934
and robbed the place.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.103
Kira, play the 911, would ya?

12:18.105 --> 12:21.123
Here it comes.

12:21.124 --> 12:24.142
WOMAN:
Oh, my God! Help me, please!
Help me, please!

12:24.144 --> 12:26.010
Help! Put that down!

12:26.012 --> 12:27.245
How far are you guys?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.446
Three minutes.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.814
Okay, don't approach
without cover.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.416
They could be expecting us.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.753
Get some intel. Hold off on
entry until we go in as a team.

12:34.755 --> 12:35.820
Got it.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.176
No signs of forced entry
on black or white wall.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.978
Okay. No broken
basement windows?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.897
That's a negative.

13:01.898 --> 13:03.815
Maybe the Underground Boys
are trying a new MO.

13:03.817 --> 13:07.285
Could be something else.
Who knows?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.053
Sarah and Josh Scott.
She's an illustrator.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.622
Works from home.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.190
He runs
a software design company.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.825
Neighbor saw them leave
together early this morning,

13:13.827 --> 13:16.227
but she returned home alone
around 9:15.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.930
That doesn't sound like
a domestic, does it?

13:18.932 --> 13:20.965
Unless the guy came back
and walked in on the wife

13:20.967 --> 13:23.401
doing something
she didn't want him to see.

13:23.402 --> 13:25.836
Or she opened the door
to the intruders herself.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.306
PARKER:
Sam, let's move forward on this.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.141
Make contact, but go careful.
Yes, sir.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.409
Jules, I'm dialing in.

13:35.549 --> 13:37.849
Kira, can you patch me through

13:37.851 --> 13:39.150
to the source of the 911?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.486
Mm-hmm.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.321
(phone ringing in distance)

13:43.323 --> 13:45.423
Come on.

13:47.460 --> 13:51.963
This is Sam Braddock from the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.199
We're here to resolve
the situation,

13:54.200 --> 13:56.434
but we can't help
unless you pick up the phone.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.071
We got movement
on white Alpha Two.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.407
Throw phone?

14:04.244 --> 14:05.610
Okay, team,
it's not a domestic.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.246
The husband was at work,
and he's on his way.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.048
Boss, we're thinking
about a throw phone.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.849
If they pick it up,
it will limit their movements.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.285
If they don't, we'll have
the open mike on our side.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.054
All right, copy that.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.305
Here's something weird.

14:17.306 --> 14:18.555
I just talked
to the alarm company.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.325
The alarm hasn't been triggered
today,

14:20.327 --> 14:23.394
and it was armed
a few minutes ago.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.497
So, what, the intruders come in
and then she sets the alarm?

14:26.499 --> 14:27.599
How does that work?

14:27.601 --> 14:29.367
If someone's pointing a gun
at you

14:29.369 --> 14:31.336
and they tell you to punch in
the code, you'd do it.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.205
How far are we?

14:34.207 --> 14:35.573
Two minutes out.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.623
Please step away
from your window.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.291
We are throwing a phone
into the house.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.459
The window's going
to break.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.240
(woman gasping)
(phone ringing)

15:09.242 --> 15:10.508
What the hell was that?!

15:12.412 --> 15:14.112
Please, please answer!

15:14.114 --> 15:16.214
Please talk to them!

15:16.215 --> 15:18.315
Shut up! Shut up! You don't get
to tell me what to do!

15:18.318 --> 15:20.084
Don't tell me what to do!

15:20.086 --> 15:23.388
This is Sam Braddock from the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.456
Get away from my house!

15:25.458 --> 15:26.357
This is Sarah?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.359
Get down and stay down!

15:28.361 --> 15:30.261
Stay down!

15:30.263 --> 15:31.596
(sirens blaring)

15:36.603 --> 15:39.070
(tires screech)

15:39.072 --> 15:41.239
Don't... don't move!

15:41.241 --> 15:42.507
Okay!

15:42.509 --> 15:44.442
(phone ringing)

15:44.444 --> 15:48.513
I just...
I-I just want the truth!

15:49.349 --> 15:51.049
Sarah!

15:51.051 --> 15:52.517
Don't!

15:56.723 --> 15:58.423
Sarah!

15:58.425 --> 16:01.259
Just tell me
the truth!

16:01.261 --> 16:03.428
Sarge, we lost the ear.
She threw the phone out.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.513
It's escalating.

16:05.514 --> 16:07.597
Okay, we have
a hostage situation
with an unknown weapon.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.633
Talk is number one.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.301
But be ready
with an immediate action

16:10.303 --> 16:11.536
if the hostage
is threatened.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.570
Spike, you're less lethal.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.139
Jules, you're Sierra One.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.675
Let's set up the LADD.
Number one on white,
number two on black.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.143
At least we can keep
listening.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.446
Copy that.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.381
Sam, I want you to say
on the loudhailer.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.350
Be persistent
with no pressure.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.684
You're not taking over?

16:26.686 --> 16:28.586
Negative.
Copy that.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.588
Sarah, I'd really like
to know...

16:30.590 --> 16:36.627
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:36.629 --> 16:40.131
I need to make sure
everyone's okay in there, Sarah.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.002
Ed, I'm gonna
run tactics.

16:44.004 --> 16:48.172
You and Lou run
Command Post.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.308
Wha...?
Command Post?

16:50.310 --> 16:51.409
Oprah says.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.611
Yes, sir.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.454
Let's get a list of all the
license plates parked nearby.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.392
What?

17:07.394 --> 17:09.460
You... in the truck.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.529
What can I tell you?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.731
It's backwards day.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.633
MAN:
Let me through.
Get out of my way.

17:15.635 --> 17:16.801
OFFICER:
Sir...

17:16.803 --> 17:19.037
Get out of my way.
My wife's in there.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.471
Let me through. Sarah!

17:20.473 --> 17:21.472
Let go of me!

17:21.474 --> 17:22.807
Joshua Scott.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.575
Mr. Scott.

17:26.312 --> 17:27.578
Thank you, Constable.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.780
What are you doing?!

17:28.782 --> 17:30.699
We can't let you come
any closer.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.617
My wife is in there. She's in
danger. What are you doing?

17:32.619 --> 17:34.152
Sir, we're not sure
it was your wife

17:34.154 --> 17:36.120
that placed
the 911 call.
What do you mean?

17:36.122 --> 17:38.623
We believe your wife is holding
someone in there

17:38.625 --> 17:39.624
against their will.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.627
Sarah?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.095
No, Sarah
would never do that.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.563
Sir, are there any firearms
in the house?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.465
No, there's no firearms
in the house.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.167
Stand back, sir, please.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.568
Team, husband claims
there are no guns
in the house.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.470
We might be looking at a knife,

17:52.472 --> 17:54.372
scissors,
razor blade.
Look, she would

17:54.374 --> 17:55.373
just never do that.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.607
Sir, I can't
have you do that.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.176
You need to
step back.
Okay, okay.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.546
Now I need you to help me.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.548
I need you to help me
with some answers, okay?

18:03.550 --> 18:06.384
What can you tell me about
her state of mind this morning?

18:06.386 --> 18:09.187
She was upset.
We had a fight, an argument.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.189
Your wife is in there
with an unknown weapon

18:11.191 --> 18:13.658
and a hostage, and we don't want
to make her more upset, okay?

18:13.660 --> 18:15.493
I don't think it's
a good idea if she sees you

18:15.495 --> 18:17.011
through the window
right now.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.528
Okay.
You got to trust
me on this.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.315
This is what we do.
Okay.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.100
Okay, I want you to come
into the truck over here.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.101
Talk to my guys,

18:23.103 --> 18:25.403
tell 'em
what you know.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.341
(Lane reading)

18:32.846 --> 18:34.378
Unknown weapon.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.746
EUP: Sarah Scott.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.216
Unidentified hostage.

18:38.218 --> 18:42.120
Sergeant Parker to direct
tactical plan.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.554
How you doing? I'm Ed Lane.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.789
Louis Young.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.426
Have a seat,
please, Josh.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.863
You texted him twice
this morning.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.165
It's professional.
I told you.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.600
You're lying.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.604
What about
"Yesterday was amazing"?!

19:09.415 --> 19:11.349
Any movement?

19:11.351 --> 19:14.152
No, but I definitely scared them
away from the windows.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.486
A little
aggressive, huh?

19:15.488 --> 19:16.687
You're doing good.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.797
Okay.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.806
Move as soon as we got
a position on 'em.

19:35.808 --> 19:36.641
Copy.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.342
Gordy, we got ears yet?

19:38.344 --> 19:40.545
Getting an audio signal.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.614
Please!
Tell me the truth!

19:43.616 --> 19:46.717
If we could just go
outside, please?

19:46.719 --> 19:49.720
You can just talk
to your husband.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.956
Please, let me talk to my wife.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.925
Josh, we can't right now.
We can't.

19:54.928 --> 19:56.494
Spike's on Less Lethal.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.795
Boss gonna need you
with the gas.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.597
What do you mean, "lethal"?

19:59.599 --> 20:01.632
Josh, Plan A is less lethal.

20:01.634 --> 20:02.633
Less lethal?

20:02.635 --> 20:03.634
Rubber bullets.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.269
How can you be less dead?

20:05.271 --> 20:08.372
We dislodge the weapon,
restrain the subject.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.974
This is insane.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.575
You have all this hardware
for an upset woman

20:11.578 --> 20:12.710
with maybe a knife.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.329
Knife's as bad as a gun.

20:14.330 --> 20:15.947
It never sticks, never jams,
never runs out of ammo

20:15.949 --> 20:17.748
and you don't need training
to know how to use it.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.351
So just sit down

20:20.353 --> 20:21.752
and calm yourself.

20:22.956 --> 20:27.491
Please, please,
I'm so scared!
Please?!

20:27.493 --> 20:28.659
(hushed):
I've got eyes.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.828
Female hostage.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.296
Knife confirmed.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.264
Threat imminent.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.699
Spike, stand by.

20:34.701 --> 20:35.766
Copy.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.302
On my go.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.938
Please don't hurt me!

20:40.940 --> 20:42.673
I'm pregnant!

20:44.777 --> 20:46.711
(gasping)

20:51.517 --> 20:52.466
She's pregnant.

20:52.467 --> 20:53.416
Hostage is pregnant.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.952
Stand down!

20:54.954 --> 20:56.454
Stand down. Stand down.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.688
We got a pregnant hostage.

20:57.690 --> 21:02.893
You... you're having his baby?

21:02.895 --> 21:04.996
No.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.533
(laughs)

21:09.535 --> 21:10.701
You're having his baby.

21:12.572 --> 21:16.307
(shrieking):
Your having his... (gasps)

21:20.780 --> 21:25.383
I knew it. I knew that there was
a reason that, that...

21:25.385 --> 21:27.585
why he'd given up.
It was you.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.321
Please, you're not making sense.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.889
You're coming with me.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.724
Please, you need to talk
to someone.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.725
Get up!

21:34.727 --> 21:36.027
Okay, team, new rules:

21:36.029 --> 21:38.496
No Taser, no CS gas
and no rubber bullets.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.331
Not a lot of tools
in the toolkit.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.499
Gordy, we hear anything yet?

21:41.501 --> 21:42.800
Yeah, it's not clear.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.735
Please! Please!

21:44.737 --> 21:46.437
Go up the stairs.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.638
(sobbing)

21:47.640 --> 21:48.773
(screaming)

21:51.944 --> 21:53.477
They're wrestling.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.780
Spike?
I've lost them.
I've lost visual.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.886
Boss, let me send in some gas,
clear them out.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.487
Negative. She's pregnant.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.723
We got to go in, boss.
We got to risk it.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.393
(yelling)

22:14.967 --> 22:17.768
(screaming)

22:18.604 --> 22:19.704
No! No!

22:19.706 --> 22:21.572
Enough!

22:21.574 --> 22:24.709
Please watch out
for the baby!

22:24.711 --> 22:26.344
Enough!

22:26.346 --> 22:28.679
Enough, enough.

22:28.681 --> 22:32.850
Enough. Enough.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.852
Please, please don't
hurt the baby.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.855
Thank you.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.758
Thank you. Thank you.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.826
Come on.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.627
Let's go.

22:43.629 --> 22:44.762
Upstairs.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.430
I need to show
you something.

22:46.432 --> 22:48.499
ED:
So you have no idea
who this woman is?

22:48.501 --> 22:50.735
No.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.037
Your wife thinks you're having
an affair with her, Josh.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.039
I am, I am not having
an affair.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.141
You understand the risk
you're taking

22:57.143 --> 22:58.809
if you lie to me?

22:58.811 --> 23:01.412
I love my wife.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.848
We had a tough time,
but I love my wife.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.783
I understand that,
but what I don't understand

23:05.785 --> 23:07.485
is who she has
in that room with her

23:07.487 --> 23:09.520
and why she has a knife
to her throat.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.855
LOUIS:
Mr. Scott,
we need you

23:10.857 --> 23:12.556
to draw a floor plan
of your house.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.208
Both floors, Josh.

23:14.209 --> 23:15.859
Every door-- which way it opens
and every window.

23:15.862 --> 23:16.861
Okay.

23:16.863 --> 23:17.962
ED:
Thank you.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.563
Eddie, Eddie, what's he saying?

23:19.565 --> 23:20.898
That he's not involved
with anyone.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.800
You believe him?
No.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.136
Okay, she says she wants
the truth, and so do I.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.438
He was saying they were having
a fight this morning,

23:27.440 --> 23:28.539
talking about having a baby.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.707
Let's see how that escalated

23:29.709 --> 23:31.559
before this knife
starts swinging again.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.410
Lou, I want you to patch me in
on this conversation.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.613
I want Sam and I to hear it.
Copy that.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.749
Sarah, it's Sam.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.184
I'm trying to phone again.
Please pick up.

23:43.022 --> 23:46.190
(phone ringing)

23:55.935 --> 23:58.702
Did he tell you about this? Hmm?

23:58.704 --> 24:00.771
(phone ringing)
What?

24:00.773 --> 24:05.209
About the eight years?

24:05.211 --> 24:09.146
I don't know.
I don't know what you're saying.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.081
Shut up!

24:11.083 --> 24:12.883
Over there.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.084
(phone ringing)
Get over there.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.888
I...
Sit down!

24:17.890 --> 24:20.591
I interviewed him
for the conference in New York

24:20.593 --> 24:22.960
for<i> Wired</i> magazine.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.929
We had tea.

24:24.931 --> 24:28.799
That's what I meant by
"yesterday was amazing."

24:28.801 --> 24:29.834
You're lying.
The interview...

24:29.836 --> 24:32.603
The interview was amazing.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.772
SAM:
Sarah, I need you
to come to the phone

24:34.774 --> 24:36.474
so we can talk
about your safety.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.042
(phone ringing)

24:44.817 --> 24:46.517
What did you do?

24:46.519 --> 24:48.652
Nothing.

24:48.654 --> 24:49.987
What did you just do?!

24:49.989 --> 24:51.188
Nothing.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.859
We've been trying to have
a baby for eight years.

24:54.861 --> 24:58.095
Eight years
of hormone shots,
IVF treatments.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.163
We took out loans.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.633
We drained the accounts.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.702
It looks like we can
afford it, right?

25:04.704 --> 25:06.804
But we couldn't.

25:06.806 --> 25:10.007
A year ago we get pregnant,
finally.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.909
But we didn't want
to tell anyone

25:11.911 --> 25:13.911
because we wanted to be sure.

25:13.912 --> 25:15.912
So we waited--
one month, two months, three...

25:15.915 --> 25:19.517
At four months, we made this...

25:19.519 --> 25:21.986
we made this room for the baby.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.290
We let ourselves believe.

25:28.528 --> 25:31.896
We told everyone.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.264
And we lost it.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.834
How'd she handle it?

25:36.836 --> 25:38.569
She fought back.
She's a fighter.

25:38.571 --> 25:40.170
I didn't want to give up.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.974
For him.

25:46.679 --> 25:49.980
He should be a father.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.683
Is she delusional?
Mentally unstable?

25:52.685 --> 25:54.702
No.

25:54.703 --> 25:56.720
No, I mean she...
she was depressed for a while,

25:56.722 --> 25:58.455
but she's not deluded.

25:58.456 --> 26:00.189
Then tell me why she thinks
you're having an affair

26:00.192 --> 26:02.159
with a total stranger, Josh?

26:02.161 --> 26:04.695
LOUIS:
Boss, we're picking up
some kind of audio signal.

26:04.697 --> 26:05.930
What kind of audio signal?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.731
From the house,
intercom maybe.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.283
Patch it in.

26:09.284 --> 26:10.834
Josh, you guys have
an intercom at your house?

26:10.836 --> 26:11.902
No.

26:11.904 --> 26:12.970
Walkie-talkies,
anything?

26:12.972 --> 26:15.005
We're picking up
voices here.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.575
I mean, we have a baby monitor,
but it wouldn't be on.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.209
Where?

26:19.211 --> 26:20.578
In the nursery.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.012
What floor?
It's on the second floor,

26:22.014 --> 26:23.047
front of
the house.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.048
(typing)

26:24.050 --> 26:25.816
Can you get it any clearer, Lou?

26:25.818 --> 26:27.084
I'm working on it.

26:30.323 --> 26:32.323
Okay, team,
we know we're not welcome here,

26:32.325 --> 26:34.291
so let's go stealth,
low and slow.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.360
Spike and Wordy,
I want you on entry with me.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.662
Jules.

26:37.663 --> 26:38.963
LOUIS:
My cousin has a baby monitor.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.965
It's a two-way,
so the kid can hear the parents.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.133
It's worth a try.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.300
Okay, try to tap
into that frequency.

26:43.302 --> 26:44.735
Sam, she's not going
to answer that phone.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.404
We'll try this way in.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.072
Jules, I want you to find
a scorpio position on the roof.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.940
I think I saw a skylight
up there.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.142
That'll be Plan B.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.777
And bring a camera pole.

26:56.916 --> 26:57.948
(sobbing)

26:57.950 --> 26:59.967
I just need to get

26:59.968 --> 27:01.985
through this without you
trying something again.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.721
Okay?

27:03.723 --> 27:05.055
Okay, we got ears,

27:05.057 --> 27:06.991
and we're good to talk
anytime you say, Sam.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.393
Channel 4.

27:09.394 --> 27:11.794
Good work, Lou. I'm gonna
need you on entry with me,

27:11.797 --> 27:13.330
and get the husband's keys.

27:21.641 --> 27:24.742
If you want to get
out of here alive,

27:24.744 --> 27:28.679
then you're going to tell me
what happened in New York.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.715
You're going to tell me

27:31.717 --> 27:35.185
why you were
there with him.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.056
What happened after tea?

27:39.058 --> 27:42.026
Nothing.

27:45.398 --> 27:48.365
What was so amazing then, hmm?

27:48.367 --> 27:53.137
What do you want me to say?

27:53.139 --> 27:54.204
Huh, what do you want?

27:56.208 --> 28:00.077
I lose either way, right?

28:00.079 --> 28:01.712
What kind of answer
do you expect

28:01.714 --> 28:06.116
when you wave a knife
in someone's face?

28:06.118 --> 28:10.120
I will know the truth
when I hear it.

28:11.090 --> 28:14.158
You're not going
to like the truth.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.179
(phone rings)

28:35.181 --> 28:36.180
Go, Kira.

28:36.182 --> 28:38.282
License plates coming at you.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.250
All right,
let's see what we got.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.119
Josh, you recognize
any of these?

28:48.227 --> 28:49.493
Hannah Murray.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.762
Oh, my God.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.497
She rented a car
that's parked down the street.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.498
You know her?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.934
She's a reporter from New York.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.969
How do you know her?

28:58.971 --> 29:00.738
Why would she...?

29:00.740 --> 29:01.772
I haven't seen her since...

29:01.774 --> 29:03.173
Since when,
Josh, since when?

29:03.175 --> 29:05.909
Are you telling me that you
had a thing with this woman?

29:05.911 --> 29:07.111
We got to know, buddy,

29:07.113 --> 29:08.912
'cause if you did,
that changes everything.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.182
I did.

29:12.184 --> 29:15.018
I've known Josh for 18 years.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.354
(exhales)

29:17.356 --> 29:20.090
Before Sarah,

29:20.092 --> 29:23.127
we were friends, really close,

29:23.129 --> 29:24.795
but never more than friends.

29:24.797 --> 29:27.331
From the first moment we met,
we had a connection,

29:27.333 --> 29:28.899
you know, like...

29:31.237 --> 29:35.506
...a really strong connection
like...

29:35.508 --> 29:38.976
the ones
you can't really explain.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.911
JOSH:
<i> And we lost touch,</i>

29:40.913 --> 29:43.247
and then one day,
I'm in New York in a conference,

29:43.249 --> 29:47.184
and we bump into each other
and sh...

29:47.186 --> 29:50.120
she asked me
if she could interview me.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.223
Then I'm talking to him face
to face after all these years,

29:53.225 --> 29:58.162
and it's like
no time has passed.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.831
<i> Sarah and I were</i>
<i> in this really bad place.</i>

30:00.833 --> 30:06.136
I mean, I don't want blame it
on fertility treatments, but...

30:06.138 --> 30:08.138
He said somewhere in there

30:08.140 --> 30:10.374
it was like you two stopped
having anything to say

30:10.376 --> 30:11.892
to each other.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.409
<i> Every conversation was about:</i>

30:13.412 --> 30:15.012
when's the next
doctor's appointment,

30:15.014 --> 30:17.081
what are the odds,

30:17.082 --> 30:19.149
how, how are we going to afford
to pay for the next treatment?

30:19.151 --> 30:21.218
And, you know, I-I
don't want to sound

30:21.220 --> 30:22.419
like I'm
making excuses.

30:22.421 --> 30:26.390
I-I don't want to make ex...
oh, my God.

30:26.392 --> 30:29.493
Josh was still Josh,
but he'd changed.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.395
I could see that.

30:31.397 --> 30:34.398
He was sadder,

30:34.400 --> 30:36.300
like the life
had gone out of him.

30:36.302 --> 30:39.970
like...

30:39.972 --> 30:41.972
like he'd forgotten
how to laugh.

30:41.974 --> 30:45.309
And you, you laughed.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.278
JOSH:
Afterwards,
I'm lying next to her,

30:48.280 --> 30:50.113
and all I can think about
is Sarah,

30:50.115 --> 30:52.583
and I'm thinking to myself,

30:52.585 --> 30:55.018
"What have I done?"

30:55.020 --> 30:56.920
Spike, what's going on?
I need eyes in.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.257
Barricaded?

31:01.360 --> 31:04.328
Sarah saw my father
through three rounds of chemo.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.999
You know,
she was there in the hospital

31:09.001 --> 31:10.500
with me when my father died.

31:10.502 --> 31:13.403
Oh, my God.

31:13.405 --> 31:16.240
(sniffles)

31:16.242 --> 31:19.209
That one night was
the biggest mistake of my life.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.979
It was the night
that was always meant to be.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.248
It was just 15 years late.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.452
That night...

31:30.422 --> 31:33.357
Oh, my God,
he came alive again.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.294
All right, I'm in position.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.528
No joy yet-- I'm going to try

31:38.530 --> 31:40.264
the camera pole.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.099
(whispering):
Spike,

31:42.101 --> 31:43.467
get up there with Jules.

31:49.008 --> 31:51.341
Sam, Sam,
this is our last chance.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.576
Unless you got something
to go on,

31:52.578 --> 31:55.178
I got to send Jules in
on an explosive entry.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.647
No, hold on the entry.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.115
Patch me into the room.
Let me give it a shot.

31:58.117 --> 32:01.385
<i> I couldn't tell Sarah,</i>
<i> I just... I couldn't.</i>

32:01.387 --> 32:04.421
You know, and when I got back,

32:04.423 --> 32:07.457
when I got back, every
time I looked at her,

32:07.459 --> 32:10.027
I just... I loved her more,

32:10.029 --> 32:13.196
and I was so scared
that I was going to lose her,

32:13.198 --> 32:16.266
you know, and that just,
that just changed everything.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.669
It changed
everything.

32:18.671 --> 32:22.572
What have I done?
What have I done?

32:22.574 --> 32:26.443
Josh, you told us the truth.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.247
You did the right thing.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.483
(typing)

32:33.485 --> 32:35.052
You ready, Sam?

32:35.054 --> 32:36.386
Yeah.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.957
It's on channel 4.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.391
The baby...

32:41.393 --> 32:44.227
Yeah.

32:44.229 --> 32:46.964
(whispers):
Is Josh the father?

32:54.740 --> 32:56.373
SAM (over speaker):
Sarah?

32:56.375 --> 32:58.542
It's Sam, Sarah.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.377
We were able to open a frequency

33:00.379 --> 33:01.745
on that monitor in your room.

33:01.747 --> 33:04.414
They're talking about
sending a team in there.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.350
SAM:
I don't want to send anyone in.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.051
I want you to come out, Sarah.

33:08.053 --> 33:10.320
(crying):
Oh, God...

33:10.322 --> 33:12.389
(sobs)

33:13.459 --> 33:14.424
It's you.

33:14.426 --> 33:18.195
That's why he gave up so easily.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.030
'Cause...

33:20.032 --> 33:22.499
he wants to be with you.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.204
(whispers):
And the baby.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.373
(whimpering)

33:29.375 --> 33:32.042
Sarah, please, I need you
to listen to me.

33:32.044 --> 33:34.211
You know what
he promised me?

33:34.213 --> 33:36.279
He promised me...

33:36.281 --> 33:38.115
no matter what,

33:38.117 --> 33:40.550
through thick and thin,
we'd be together.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.521
Is that what she's saying?

33:45.724 --> 33:47.224
That's what she's saying?

33:47.226 --> 33:49.526
And I don't think
any of that's changed, Sarah.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.661
No, no, no.
(sniffles)

33:51.663 --> 33:54.498
No, because when he got back
from New York,

33:54.500 --> 33:56.500
he was changed.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.235
He was different.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.504
Like he was
trying too hard.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.075
SARAH:
...when the doctor

34:05.077 --> 34:08.478
told us to stop trying,
I couldn't stop crying.

34:10.816 --> 34:13.116
He didn't cry.

34:13.118 --> 34:14.451
Not once.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.486
Tell her I did. I...

34:16.488 --> 34:17.754
I just...
it was just...

34:17.756 --> 34:19.456
just never in
front of her,

34:19.458 --> 34:22.192
'cause I wanted to be strong
for her, I wanted...

34:22.194 --> 34:23.827
I wanted to be strong for...

34:23.829 --> 34:25.429
(whimpering, crying)

34:25.431 --> 34:27.697
(panting quickly)

34:29.201 --> 34:30.801
JOSH:
Look, just t-tell her I'm here.

34:30.803 --> 34:33.370
Tell her that I...
that I love her.

34:33.372 --> 34:35.439
T-Tell her about
the Bridge of Sighs.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.474
Tell her
about the Bridge of Sighs.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.309
Boss, you get that
entry option lined up,

34:39.311 --> 34:41.545
No, Ed, hold it.
you've got to go for it.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.513
Give the husband a headset.

34:48.153 --> 34:49.803
Mr. Scott?

34:49.804 --> 34:51.454
This is Sam Braddock; I'm
the guy talking to your wife.

34:51.457 --> 34:53.457
Tell me about
the Bridge of Sighs.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.492
I got eyes.

34:55.494 --> 34:56.626
Tell me.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.361
Knife is pointed down.

34:58.363 --> 35:00.330
What's the subject's state?

35:00.332 --> 35:02.466
She's crying, distracted.

35:02.467 --> 35:04.601
Boss, threat is low.
I can do this. I can see access.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.471
Alpha One and Two, requesting
permission to enter, sir.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.206
We go through the skylight,
we'll spook her.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.407
She might use the knife.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.576
Sir, she does not
want to use that knife.

35:12.578 --> 35:13.610
Do you know that?

35:13.611 --> 35:14.643
This isn't aggression anymore.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.146
This is grief.

35:16.148 --> 35:18.548
She's almost done.
She just wants the truth.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.484
JULES:
Boss, I can see this.
You're not seeing it.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.452
Sam's not seeing it.
I can see it.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.254
We can be in there
within three seconds.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.489
We'll disarm her.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.691
The knife is down.
Repeat: the knife is down.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.793
The truth is the only thing
she's been asking for,

35:29.795 --> 35:31.695
her one demand,
and she's not getting it.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.833
Okay. Okay, the knife
is still in her hand.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.603
Constable Braddock
will continue with negotiation.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.711
Sarah?

35:47.713 --> 35:49.479
Do you know what?

35:49.481 --> 35:52.549
I'm really not that great
with words, but...

35:52.551 --> 35:55.485
but I've been talking
to a guy who is.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.488
And he's been telling me
a lot about you.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.624
About how he made a big mistake,

36:00.626 --> 36:02.526
about how much he loves you...

36:02.528 --> 36:05.195
That's not true!

36:06.532 --> 36:08.498
And he wanted me to tell you...

36:08.500 --> 36:12.169
about the Bridge of Sighs.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.803
When my father died...

36:13.805 --> 36:17.507
And when his father died
and he'd lost his job,

36:17.509 --> 36:19.643
you bought two tickets
to Venice,

36:19.645 --> 36:22.879
and you said you'd walk over
the Bridge of Sighs together.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.714
Yeah.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.952
To gain perspective.

36:28.953 --> 36:31.554
When you've been through
so many... losses together...

36:31.557 --> 36:33.623
...you're connected,

36:33.625 --> 36:35.458
you belong to each other.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.427
Always.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.196
Sarah, Josh loves you.

36:39.198 --> 36:41.364
It's taking about six of us

36:41.366 --> 36:43.767
to stop him from
rushing in there, Sarah.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.702
You want the truth?

36:45.704 --> 36:49.773
This is it: he loves you.

36:53.212 --> 36:56.713
(yelling)

36:56.715 --> 36:59.616
Subject is down.
Hostage has weapon.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.684
Go, go, go, go!

37:02.988 --> 37:05.522
(explosion)

37:06.491 --> 37:07.857
Move away from the door!

37:08.794 --> 37:10.660
Move away
from the door!

37:10.662 --> 37:12.796
Down! Stay down!

37:12.798 --> 37:16.600
JULES:
Put your hands where
I can see them! Stay down!

37:16.602 --> 37:18.535
Stay on the ground.
Stay on the ground.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.503
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

37:23.008 --> 37:25.342
Eddie, paramedics, right away.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.356
Hey, buddy,
what's her status?

37:39.358 --> 37:41.524
Unstable.
Knife hit a major vessel.

37:41.526 --> 37:42.759
Massive blood loss.

37:42.761 --> 37:43.960
Sarah...

37:43.962 --> 37:46.329
Sarah! Oh, my God!
Out of the way, sir.

37:46.331 --> 37:47.497
Oh, my God.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.266
(panting)

37:49.268 --> 37:50.734
Is she gonna be all right?

37:50.736 --> 37:52.802
We'll take
care of her.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.775
There.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.677
We'll get you
in an ambulance.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.746
They'll take a look at you.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.686
Okay, come on.

38:09.688 --> 38:12.422
Sarah, Sarah...

38:13.659 --> 38:16.626
...the hospital where the doc
will take a look at you.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.628
(siren wailing)

38:18.630 --> 38:21.598
JULES:
<i> This didn't have to happen.</i>
<i> This did not have to happen.</i>

38:21.600 --> 38:23.967
PARKER:
There are always variables
that we can't anticipate.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.502
But, Sarge,
we could've saved them both.

38:25.504 --> 38:26.770
There's no way
we could know.

38:26.772 --> 38:29.339
"11:06 a.m. Callaghan:
Boss, threat is low.

38:29.341 --> 38:30.974
"I can do this. I see access.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.543
"Braddock: She wants the truth.
She's responding.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.812
Give me a shot."
It was a risk either way.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.014
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.015
"11:09 a.m.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.383
"Alpha One and Two,

38:40.385 --> 38:41.818
"explosive
entry through

38:41.820 --> 38:43.687
Black Charlie Three."
I had a connection.

38:43.689 --> 38:46.790
She did not need to
be subdued by force.
"Subject was lying prone

38:46.792 --> 38:48.792
on the floor,
a knife wound to the chest."

38:48.794 --> 38:50.493
We know, Jules. We were there.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.945
"11:17.

38:51.946 --> 38:53.396
Subject in critical condition.
Taken to hospital."

38:53.398 --> 38:54.631
We were there.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.466
I had eyes in.
There was time to get in.

38:56.468 --> 38:57.467
The knife was down.

38:57.469 --> 38:58.702
And then the hostage escalated.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.904
Which she wouldn't have
if we'd already gone in.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.739
Sam, you were the negotiator.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.641
It's your right
to call it how you see it.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.743
We can't second-guess whether
an earlier tactical response

39:06.745 --> 39:08.611
might have had
a different outcome.

39:08.613 --> 39:11.047
Due respect, sir, but it
came down to talk or tactics,

39:11.049 --> 39:13.550
and you're the one
that called talk.
That's right.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.684
Because maybe that's the call

39:14.686 --> 39:16.119
a negotiator
would make.
Whoa, whoa.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.021
Look, I'm just saying,
all right?

39:18.023 --> 39:19.956
I want to know what
Ed would have done.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.791
It was the sarge's call!

39:21.793 --> 39:23.860
I want to know, too.

39:25.497 --> 39:27.130
ED:
Sometimes you do
everything right.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.101
Things still go wrong.

39:31.103 --> 39:33.103
That's the job.

39:33.105 --> 39:34.938
Situation was gray.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.906
The boss made

39:36.908 --> 39:39.576
a black-and-white call.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.044
We saved the hostage. Period.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.779
(door opening)

39:43.882 --> 39:45.849
Uh, sorry.

39:45.851 --> 39:46.816
The hospital
just called.

39:46.818 --> 39:47.984
Sarah Scott.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.386
Doctors got her stabilized.

39:49.388 --> 39:50.887
She's gonna be all right.

39:53.125 --> 39:54.491
That's great, Kira.

39:54.493 --> 39:55.759
Thanks for letting us know.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.827
Okay.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.903
Okay, then.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.072
That's good.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.107
Right?

40:22.053 --> 40:25.555
¶ ¶

40:28.960 --> 40:32.028
¶ ¶

40:35.801 --> 40:39.769
¶ ¶

40:41.573 --> 40:47.844
¶ ¶

40:47.846 --> 40:49.212
Need to talk.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.514
Take a number.

40:51.516 --> 40:52.849
All right.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.684
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.019
Hey, Eddie.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.657
I'm sorry.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.793
Today should have
gone better. Uh...

41:03.795 --> 41:07.831
You need to be back
where you belong.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.899
Team needs you back.

41:11.670 --> 41:15.772
I'm thinking, I'm-I'm gonna
get Soph, I'm gonna get Clark.

41:15.774 --> 41:18.208
We're gonna go up
and get a cottage, you know?

41:18.210 --> 41:20.210
Regroup, like you...

41:20.212 --> 41:21.811
Like you said.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.113
That's great. That's great.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.850
You know, unless, uh,

41:26.852 --> 41:29.986
you feel useless
or something without me.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.855
(knocking)

41:31.857 --> 41:34.657
Decent.

41:34.659 --> 41:38.695
¶ ¶

41:40.966 --> 41:42.966
I'm sorry.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.068
I shouldn't have jumped on you
like that.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.836
No, it's okay. I get it.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.905
We all wanted them out safe.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.775
What?

41:52.777 --> 41:55.278
I don't know if
we should do this.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.982
Sneaking around
on the team.

41:58.984 --> 42:02.218
We put our lives
in each other's hands, and...

42:02.220 --> 42:05.255
Yeah, and you're thinking
we should take a break.

42:05.257 --> 42:07.123
I don't know.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.892
I don't know what I'm thinking.

42:08.894 --> 42:10.527
¶ ¶

42:10.529 --> 42:13.162
Me, neither.

42:13.164 --> 42:15.598
Okay, so, take a break tonight?

42:15.600 --> 42:18.001
Give us time to think?

42:21.006 --> 42:24.107
Or we could think while
priming my drywall.

42:25.310 --> 42:27.744
That's not fair.

42:27.746 --> 42:31.080
You know
how much I love priming drywall.

42:31.082 --> 42:33.082
Yeah, almost as much

42:33.084 --> 42:37.220
as you love my protein-mango
breakfast smoothies.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.755
Hmm? Hmm?
Don't do this to me.

42:38.757 --> 42:41.124
I'm just saying.

42:41.126 --> 42:46.596
¶ ¶

42:48.867 --> 42:51.134
(whispers):
It's all clear.
