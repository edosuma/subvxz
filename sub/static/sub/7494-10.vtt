WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:03.037
Last time on
Make It Pop.

00:03.071 --> 00:04.072
You're out as DJ.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.106
You are a genius.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.308
I knew I
was gifted.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.077
You lost the dress?

00:09.110 --> 00:10.744
No, I left it
right there.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.481
Someone either took it or
kept it for themselves?

00:13.514 --> 00:16.450
I hope I didn't cause you too
much "Diss Dress".

00:16.484 --> 00:19.453
The Homecoming dance is a
time-honored tradition that has

00:19.487 --> 00:23.757
never been missed in MacKendrick
Prep's storied history.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.193
But now it's cancelled.

00:25.226 --> 00:28.429
Because Caleb Davis
destroyed the gym.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.465
Thank you, and
have a nice day.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.438
It was an accident.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.440
I didn't mean to
blow up the gym.

00:39.473 --> 00:43.944
Or get homecoming
cancelled or anything.

00:43.977 --> 00:46.414
What's that?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.851
Valerie: I had that Homecoming
Crown in the bag,

00:50.884 --> 00:53.421
but now that bag will only
be filled with tears.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.256
And not
metaphorical ones.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.958
Real Val tears.

00:57.991 --> 00:58.759
Whatever.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.129
Okay, I mean, sure
it's bad news,

01:01.162 --> 01:03.897
but life's an ever-
evolving process.

01:03.931 --> 01:08.436
I mean, if I can't be Homecoming
King, I'll be a real king.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.939
Find me a country
with a weak monarchy.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.741
What?!

01:21.415 --> 01:23.517
Mr. Stark!

01:23.551 --> 01:26.787
I'm so sorry for all
the trouble I've caused.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.157
But no sense in
dwelling in the past.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.359
I mean, if you can
learn to forgive me,

01:31.392 --> 01:33.561
then so can the rest
of the student body

01:33.594 --> 01:35.963
and we can move on to
more important things.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.466
There's still a hole
in my gymnasium floor.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.568
I'm not in a
forgiving mood.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.337
Yes, but I
just gotta say,

01:43.371 --> 01:46.340
That I have some awesome ideas
for The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

01:46.374 --> 01:49.577
Mr. Davis, I need another one of
your ideas like I need another

01:49.610 --> 01:53.214
eleventh place finish at the
Toledo Soliloquy Festival.

01:53.247 --> 01:53.747
Okay.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.849
So just to be clear,

01:55.883 --> 01:58.852
you don't want to
hear my ideas, right?

01:58.886 --> 02:01.422
Leave!

02:01.455 --> 02:05.459
I, I need my laptop.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.536
(gasp)

02:15.569 --> 02:18.472
Obviously you didn't take the
dress and hide it from me.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.140
I feel terrible.

02:20.174 --> 02:24.144
I'll do all your homework
for the rest of your life.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.546
I just want that
dress back.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.181
I'll go get
it for you!

02:27.215 --> 02:29.617
It still looks like it's still
in pretty good shape.

02:29.650 --> 02:34.888
(thunder and rain)

02:34.922 --> 02:36.056
Timing.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.526
Just awful timing.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.163
Look what they
did to my--

02:43.197 --> 02:45.266
They can't cancel
Homecoming!

02:45.299 --> 02:47.901
It was gonna be everyone's
greatest high school experience!

02:47.935 --> 02:49.370
I thought you hated
Homecoming.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.905
I'm talking about
my solo performance!

02:51.939 --> 02:53.607
I won't stand for this.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.610
Please don't say the four
scariest words in the English--

02:56.644 --> 03:01.515
I have a plan.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.851
We should take cover
while we still can.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.090
* Make it pop, Woo, woo

03:10.123 --> 03:13.927
* Make it pop, Woo Woo

03:13.961 --> 03:17.365
* I can't wait, no
I can't wait no *

03:17.398 --> 03:20.200
* I can't wait, no
I can't wait *

03:20.234 --> 03:23.537
* So make it pop, we're bout
to, we're bout to blow *

03:23.571 --> 03:25.138
* Wait till we drop

03:25.172 --> 03:27.140
* Oh ya, we're
ready to go *

03:27.174 --> 03:28.609
* Ain't gonna stop

03:28.642 --> 03:31.044
* when is it time
for the show *

03:31.078 --> 03:33.647
* We make it, you
make it, they make it *

03:33.681 --> 03:36.884
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

03:37.518 --> 03:40.688
*

03:40.721 --> 03:42.656
It's not too bad.

03:42.690 --> 03:46.226
It kinda looks like it
was clothing at one point.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.429
All that hard
work for nothing.

03:48.462 --> 03:51.098
Is there no end to
Valerie's schemes?

03:51.131 --> 03:52.333
Look on the bright side.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.968
You got to witness the really
cool chemical reaction that

03:55.002 --> 03:57.237
occurs when lightning
strikes a pretty dress.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.474
And you created
something amazing.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.943
No one can take
that away from you.

04:02.976 --> 04:07.147
Or prevent me
from doing it again.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.982
Thanks, Corki.

04:09.016 --> 04:12.486
I think I
have a plan.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.287
See?

04:13.321 --> 04:18.058
It's so much nicer
when you say it.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.532
Why are you
dressed in black?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.266
Did someone die?

04:26.300 --> 04:27.968
Some THING died.

04:28.001 --> 04:32.072
My last hope to stand beside
Jared as Homecoming Queen.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.974
Don't you think you're
overreacting a little?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.275
It's just a dance.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.077
Just a dance?

04:37.110 --> 04:40.113
Would you call the
Titanic "just a boat?"

04:40.147 --> 04:42.115
Homecoming was
my everything.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.184
Ugh this is no fun.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.987
I came here to taunt you
because you're a dress thief

04:47.020 --> 04:48.155
and generally
terrible person.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.523
Taunt away.

04:49.557 --> 04:52.092
Maybe I'll feel
something again.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.361
Fine.

04:53.394 --> 04:58.265
Here it goes: I'm organizing a
thing and you're not invited.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.669
A Social Media Dance.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.404
What's that, you ask?

05:03.437 --> 05:06.239
An online flash mob so
all of Sun Hi Nation,

05:06.273 --> 05:07.741
no matter where
they are,

05:07.775 --> 05:10.711
can dance together
at the same time.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.945
Wow.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.648
How could anyone be expected
to dance at a time like this?

05:17.250 --> 05:19.987
But anytime is a good
time, to dance.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.623
*

05:22.656 --> 05:27.327
* Hey, Hey-eh-yay-e-ya-ey

05:27.361 --> 05:34.702
* Where are all my
girls at today *

05:34.735 --> 05:37.438
* Slo Mo video

05:37.471 --> 05:38.071
* Ooooh

05:38.105 --> 05:40.708
* Tokyo, Busan, Miami

05:40.741 --> 05:43.811
* Don't need Halloween to dress
up just bring the candy *

05:43.844 --> 05:47.080
* All the best parties
happen for free *

05:47.114 --> 05:48.115
* Ooo, Ooo

05:48.148 --> 05:50.684
* Where my girls at?

05:50.718 --> 05:53.821
* Ooo, Ooo
Ooohhohohohohoho Ooo, Ooo *

05:53.854 --> 05:56.424
* Wanna join up, Then
don't miss a beat *

05:56.457 --> 05:57.425
* Tell 'em Jodi

05:57.458 --> 06:00.260
* We bring the party,
Dance in the street *

06:00.293 --> 06:03.263
* Come on let's get moving,
we're going in deep *

06:03.296 --> 06:06.099
* So busy dreaming,
No time to sleep *

06:06.133 --> 06:07.501
* No time to sleep

06:07.535 --> 06:09.302
* Ooo, Ooo
oh-a-whoa, Ooo, Ooo *

06:09.336 --> 06:10.237

* Ooo, Ooo Hoe-Whoa-Haaaaa,

06:13.240 --> 06:18.746
* Hey, Hey-eh-yay-e-ya-ey

06:18.779 --> 06:23.751
* Where are all my
girls at today? *

06:23.784 --> 06:32.460
* Hey, Hey-eh-yay-e-ya-ey

06:32.493 --> 06:39.600
* Where are all my
girls at today? *

06:39.633 --> 06:42.135
* Roller skating, ski dive,
dating, on trampolines *

06:42.169 --> 06:43.303
* What?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.305
* Sneakin' out late at night,
Don't run out of steam *

06:45.338 --> 06:46.273
* Run out of steam

06:46.306 --> 06:48.976
* Leaving lipstick
kisses wherever we be *

06:49.009 --> 06:52.045
* When it comes to fun,
We're the crop of the cream. *

06:52.079 --> 06:53.180
* What?

06:53.213 --> 06:56.049
* Ooo, Ooo oohh oohhh Ooo,
Ooo oohh oohh Ooo, Ooo *

06:56.083 --> 06:56.850
* Where my girls at?

06:56.884 --> 06:57.618
* Ooo, Ooo

06:57.651 --> 06:58.986
* Where my girls at?

06:59.019 --> 07:02.723
* Hey, Hey-eh-yay-e-ya-ey
whoa *

07:02.756 --> 07:04.692
* Whoa-oa-ohh

07:04.725 --> 07:09.663
* Where are all my
girls at today? *

07:09.697 --> 07:11.865
* Too-day-e-ay

07:11.899 --> 07:14.434
* Hey

07:14.468 --> 07:16.537
* Hey, hey

07:16.570 --> 07:18.572
* Hey-eh-yay-e-ya-ey
hey-e-yeah-ey *

07:18.606 --> 07:19.740
* Heyee-yay-ay

07:19.773 --> 07:23.376
* Where are all my
girls at today *

07:23.410 --> 07:28.716
* Where my girls at today?

07:28.749 --> 07:38.325
* Hey, let's go
girls, 5-6-7-Hey! *

07:52.472 --> 07:53.841
There is nothing
to dance about.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.909
Because there is
no dance.

07:55.943 --> 07:59.513
Get it?

08:00.714 --> 08:01.715
(sigh)

08:13.927 --> 08:18.298
Somebody's got a
secret admirer.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.267
You should really get
an email account!

08:20.300 --> 08:21.902
These aren't
love letters.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.271
They're angry notes
from the student body.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.506
Oh, 'cause it's your
fault Homecoming's cancelled?

08:26.540 --> 08:29.877
Yeah.

08:29.910 --> 08:33.413
"I didn't realize DJ
stood for Dumb Jerk."

08:33.446 --> 08:35.983
People can be
so cruel.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.385
Wait, this
one's from you.

08:38.418 --> 08:39.820
Oh yeah, sorry.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.889
Mob mentality,
you know?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.557
I gotta fix this mess.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.559
There's gotta be a
way to save Homecoming.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.560
I don't know.

08:46.594 --> 08:49.897
Unless you can somehow
find another gymnasium.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.505
What are you doing?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.540
Making headway.

09:00.574 --> 09:01.274
Yeah...

09:01.308 --> 09:03.577
I can see a real
difference...

09:03.611 --> 09:04.912
Yeah!

09:04.945 --> 09:06.513
Okay, so progress
is slow.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.448
But I'm convinced
I can fix this.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.450
Creative inspiration
has struck!

09:10.483 --> 09:12.285
Kind of like lightning
striking our dress...

09:12.319 --> 09:14.788
It's good to have a project
that'll take my mind

09:14.822 --> 09:18.291
off the dance
being cancelled,

09:18.692 --> 09:21.028
That's a Hye Jung
Ko original.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.129
She's my idol!

09:22.162 --> 09:24.832
For a while there, it didn't
like you would finish

09:24.865 --> 09:27.434
and I used my connections
in the high fashion scene.

09:27.467 --> 09:31.939
Who are you?

09:31.972 --> 09:33.273
No.

09:33.306 --> 09:37.778
This is not
for you.

09:37.811 --> 09:41.281
This dress
is for you.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.716
Do I even
need a dress?

09:42.750 --> 09:44.017
There's no
dance anymore.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.753
This isn't about
the dance.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.421
This is about
something bigger.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.958
I see something in
this dress, Corki.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.694
It speaks to me.

09:53.727 --> 09:59.532
It says, "I am Corki."

09:59.566 --> 10:02.302
Your dress
speaks English?

10:03.737 --> 10:04.738
Absolutely not.

10:04.772 --> 10:05.973
What?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.608
We will not have Homecoming at
your roller rink, Mr. Davis.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.843
You are a menace.

10:09.877 --> 10:12.680
I can only imagine how much
worse you would be on wheels.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.347
But, if we
were to just,

10:14.381 --> 10:15.615
There's a new
administrative policy.

10:15.649 --> 10:19.552
Any idea proposed by Caleb Davis
will automatically be rejected.

10:19.586 --> 10:23.556
It's already in
the school charter.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.094
You simply cost
us too much.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.562
And expose us to too
many potential lawsuits.

10:29.596 --> 10:32.632
Frankly, I'm afraid to
be standing this close

10:32.666 --> 10:34.367
to you right now.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.603
I'm sorry, there will be
no Homecoming this year,

10:36.636 --> 10:39.973
And please take
this bag of letters

10:40.007 --> 10:41.875
that wouldn't fit
into your locker.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.877
Wait, how do you know my
locker combination!?

10:43.911 --> 10:45.578
I know everything.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.014
She does!

10:47.580 --> 10:49.382
I wish it was
a week ago.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.418
That was a
simpler time.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.853
No one knew
who I was.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.689
I hadn't yet dashed hundreds
of young hopes and dreams.

10:55.723 --> 10:56.790
Hold still.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.525
Stop reminiscing.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.761
But I had the
perfect solution.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.764
I talked Randy into letting us
throw Homecoming at Club Ry Ri.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.099
But Stark and
Diona shot it down.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.869
You don't exactly have
the best track record.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.904
Everyone deserves
a seventh chance right?

11:10.938 --> 11:11.772
You mean
second chance.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.907
Nah, I blew by that
five chances ago.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.909
In Brooklyn we used to
throw basement parties.

11:15.943 --> 11:19.046
The parents never knew,
and the kids all had fun.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.447
That's a great idea!

11:20.480 --> 11:21.148
Thanks.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.082
What are you
talking about?

11:22.115 --> 11:24.117
We can't have the
dance in the basement.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.252
You blew up
the basement.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.621
I'm talking about doing
something that has never been

11:28.655 --> 11:31.458
done in the history
of this school:

11:31.491 --> 11:34.627
a secret Homecoming
Dance.

11:38.832 --> 11:42.669
Sun Hi: A secret Homecoming
At Club Ry Ri.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.173
Without the school's
permission.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.042
I like the way you
think, Caleb.

11:49.076 --> 11:52.412
I don't know if I can pull
off something so subversive.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.414
Sun Hi, you have
to help me.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.949
Of course I will.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.618
If people know you're
behind it, they won't come.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.520
I'm loving this idea.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.654
Corki?

12:01.688 --> 12:04.792
Even though the phrase "without
the school's permission"

12:04.825 --> 12:07.527
makes me break
out in a rash,

12:07.560 --> 12:10.831
I'm trying to be a more
supportive friend, so I'm in.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.132
That's a yes.

12:12.165 --> 12:12.966
We're a go!

12:13.000 --> 12:13.801
Yes!

12:13.834 --> 12:15.435
I'm gonna DJ
Homecoming after all!

12:15.468 --> 12:17.537
Ugh.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.171
Great.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.172
I'm out of fabric.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.440
How are we gonna get the
word out to everybody

12:20.473 --> 12:22.309
with such
little time?

12:22.342 --> 12:23.844
Lucky for you, I'm
already canvassing

12:23.877 --> 12:25.645
phone numbers for my
flash mob dance.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.314
I'll just send a
mass text.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.782
People love impersonal
mass correspondence.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.818
What if some people
don't get the message?

12:30.851 --> 12:32.820
How are they gonna
know about the dance?

12:32.853 --> 12:33.720
This is high school.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.523
Rumors travel faster
than the internet.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.557
Hey!

12:37.590 --> 12:39.259
I heard Homecoming's
being moved to Club Ry Ri!

12:39.292 --> 12:43.496
Shhhh, it's a secret.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.297
See?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.733
I didn't even
start texting yet.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.044
What're you doing
in Valerie's room?

12:57.077 --> 12:58.812
Jodi needed
more fabric.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.948
You didn't see
anything, Caleb.

13:00.981 --> 13:01.982
Right!

13:02.015 --> 13:03.083
Right...

13:03.116 --> 13:06.119
Eyes closed.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.693
This silence is
kind of eerie.

13:13.726 --> 13:14.761
I know.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.564
Maybe we should cancel
beloved events more often.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.533
It seems to have shocked the
students into good behavior.

13:20.567 --> 13:24.972
I'll make a note.

13:25.005 --> 13:28.775
All major holidays --
cancelled.

13:29.076 --> 13:36.049
*

13:36.083 --> 13:36.917
Not bad, huh?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.585
It's perfect.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.021
In fact, I think
you should wear it.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.656
You worked really hard on
it, and let's face it,

13:43.690 --> 13:46.093
I haven't been the most
supportive friend.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.095
And you'd rather
wear the Hye Jung.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.662
I don't blame you.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.531
Absolutely not true.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.901
The Jodi Mapa original
was tailored for me.

13:53.934 --> 13:58.071
True, tailoring is key.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.573
If Jared doesn't
notice you after this,

14:00.607 --> 14:02.042
he doesn't
deserve you.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.015
I insist you
wear this one.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.183
The Hye Jung Ko?

14:10.217 --> 14:13.220
You know you're probably
never getting it back, right?

14:21.761 --> 14:25.532
Whoohooo, yeahhh!

14:49.689 --> 14:50.323
It worked!

14:50.357 --> 14:53.126
The secret
dance worked!

14:53.160 --> 14:58.265
You look very nice,
by the way.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.668
Thanks.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.070
You too.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.205
Sick beats, DJ!

15:05.238 --> 15:08.608
Although, for the record,
we still don't like you!

15:08.641 --> 15:11.711
Understood.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.746
Where's Jared?

15:15.215 --> 15:18.218
Time to get this
party started!

15:18.251 --> 15:19.219
Jared!

15:19.252 --> 15:20.954
Why are you so late?

15:20.988 --> 15:22.355
My bow-tie wouldn't tie.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.856
It was a whole thing.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.858
Well, at least
you made it.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.327
It's Homecoming, Jared!

15:27.360 --> 15:29.729
We can be king and
queen after all!

15:29.762 --> 15:31.264
I've already chosen
our dance song,

15:31.298 --> 15:33.233
She did.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.973
Is that--?

15:46.980 --> 15:51.918
Corki, you look amazing.

15:51.951 --> 15:52.785
Thanks.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.869
An underground
Homecoming Dance?

16:09.902 --> 16:11.038
With no chaperones?

16:11.071 --> 16:12.439
And after hours?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.841
This is an unprecedented
act of defiance!

16:14.874 --> 16:19.046
Who is behind this?

16:19.079 --> 16:22.082
Caleb Davis. Agh.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.189
Ms. Diona!

16:29.222 --> 16:33.193
Mr. Stark, what's up?

16:33.226 --> 16:38.065
We have a chaperone!

16:38.098 --> 16:38.798
And...

16:38.831 --> 16:40.400
How did you find
out about this?

16:40.433 --> 16:42.802
We are not dense,
Mr. Davis.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.372
We saw the cafeteria
lady wearing a prom dress

16:45.405 --> 16:47.907
and she told
us 'what's up'.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.142
But this time
it's different,

16:49.176 --> 16:51.411
we followed all the
fire safety codes!

16:51.444 --> 16:54.181
Caleb, it's time.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.282
Gotta go.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.183
Gotta go where?

16:56.216 --> 16:57.284
Excuse me?

16:57.317 --> 16:59.052
We're shutting
this thing down!

16:59.086 --> 17:02.755
Mr. Stark, I think you
should see this first.

17:09.929 --> 17:17.437
* Yeah, yeah, ouhh

17:17.470 --> 17:19.306
* Remember when
we first met, *

17:19.339 --> 17:21.808
* that moment, I looked at you

17:21.841 --> 17:22.709
Oz...

17:22.742 --> 17:27.780
* and I knew that
this was it, mhmm *

17:27.814 --> 17:30.049
* I know you saw
right through me *

17:30.083 --> 17:35.888
* and clearly, we felt something
that words could not describe *

17:35.922 --> 17:38.425
* We both saw
the signs *

17:38.458 --> 17:41.261
* The way you'd talk
to me, talk to me *

17:41.294 --> 17:43.296
* and take a
walk with me *

17:43.330 --> 17:46.999
* I'd been waiting for
this for so long *

17:47.033 --> 17:49.436
* Yeah yeah

17:49.469 --> 17:53.072
* The way you held me, and told
me, one more dance maybe *

17:53.106 --> 17:57.377
* Remember how I felt
it oh so strong *

17:57.410 --> 18:00.847
* I could not believe it

18:00.880 --> 18:06.085
* I will be here,
right by your side *

18:06.119 --> 18:10.990
* All I can do, is
watch over you *

18:11.023 --> 18:19.299
* Oh, I don't if you feel the
same, still I'm wondering now *

18:19.332 --> 18:26.573
* Baby do you know my name, ooh
yeah, baby can you see it *

18:26.606 --> 18:30.210
* The starry sky is above you,
I just wanna hold you *

18:30.243 --> 18:31.611
May I have this dance?

18:31.644 --> 18:37.317
* And take you on a ride oh yeah
wish that you could feel it *

18:37.350 --> 18:40.119
* I got this feeling
inside me, I'm going crazy *

18:40.153 --> 18:42.922
Valerie: Excuse me, I'm gonna
go barf in the punch bowl.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.923
Hey, wait a minute.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.892
Is that my blanket?

18:45.925 --> 18:48.528
She's wearing
my blanket!

18:48.561 --> 18:51.531
Do you have any idea
what she's talking about?

18:51.564 --> 18:52.532
Aghh.

18:52.565 --> 18:59.306
* Yeah, I will be here,
right by your side *

18:59.339 --> 19:04.944
* All I can do, is
watch over you, oh *

19:04.977 --> 19:09.416
* I don't know if you
feel the same *

19:09.449 --> 19:12.585
* Still I'm
wondering now *

19:12.619 --> 19:15.355
* Baby do you
know my name *

19:15.388 --> 19:19.992
* Ooh yeah baby
can you see it *

19:20.026 --> 19:23.930
* The starry sky is above you,
I just wanna hold you *

19:23.963 --> 19:26.132
* And take you
on a ride *

19:26.165 --> 19:30.637
* Ooh yeah, wish that
you could feel it *

19:30.670 --> 19:34.374
* I got this feeling inside
me, I'm going crazy *

19:34.407 --> 19:38.311
* You make me
wanna fly *

19:38.345 --> 19:40.347
(cheering)

19:40.380 --> 19:45.385
(chanting: Sun Hi)

19:51.424 --> 19:52.425
Jodi: Not bad, huh?

19:52.459 --> 19:53.626
Not bad?

19:53.660 --> 19:57.930
It was glorious! Let's
punish them later.

19:57.964 --> 19:58.731
What?!

19:58.765 --> 20:00.567
The children need
time to revel

20:00.600 --> 20:02.602
in the work of art
they just witnessed.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.937
You're such a
pushover, Stark.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.374
Look, I'm sure
you'd rather be

20:07.407 --> 20:08.975
watching a Norse
Mythology marathon

20:09.008 --> 20:12.579
on the Ancient Civilizations
Network tonight...

20:12.612 --> 20:14.347
You know me
too well.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.483
Fine, I'll leave them
in your hands tonight.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.651
But they will
be punished!

20:21.554 --> 20:23.290
Sun Hi!

20:23.323 --> 20:26.393
Where did you come up with such
an out-of-the-box performance?

20:26.426 --> 20:31.030
I just think, "What will get
me the most attention,"

20:31.063 --> 20:33.266
then I go way past that.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.303
So does this mean I can do
the music for the play?

20:36.336 --> 20:38.338
Not a chance.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.545
Jared: I know there's no
official Homecoming Court,

20:45.578 --> 20:48.948
but ah you're definitely
the queen to my king.

20:48.981 --> 20:52.419
And maybe next year,
it will be official.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.420
But you're a senior.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.288
Next year you'll
be in college.

20:55.322 --> 20:58.224
I bet they'd bend
the rules for me.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.365
(phone ringing)

21:05.398 --> 21:09.702
I'm so sorry.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.238
I have to take this.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.508
Hello?

21:17.143 --> 21:18.378
What's wrong?

21:18.411 --> 21:20.513
It's my father.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.482
He's coming
for a visit.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.416
Hey, that's great!

21:23.450 --> 21:24.617
No, it's not.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.387
It's the opposite
of great.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.255
Excuse me.
