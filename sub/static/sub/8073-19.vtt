WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:06.474
[harmonica lick]

00:10.411 --> 00:11.712
Well, what is it, then?

00:11.745 --> 00:14.382
Well, I just wanted to tell
you that I've been thinking

00:14.415 --> 00:16.016
about it, and I've
come to the conclusion

00:16.050 --> 00:17.818
that it's never coming out.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.920
Never.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.189
I'm going to be a
70-year-old woman

00:21.222 --> 00:24.492
carrying a 30-year-old baby.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.195
Jackie, you're only
three days overdue.

00:27.228 --> 00:31.765
I have a three-day-old
child inside of me.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.600
Look at me.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.240
It's huge!

00:39.273 --> 00:43.611
Yes, but you have
a very pretty face.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.113
Oh, man!

00:45.146 --> 00:46.614
What is that?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.082
How come it's like that?

00:48.116 --> 00:49.283
How?

00:49.317 --> 00:53.687
Roseanne, how is this
going to come out of this?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.523
Relax, Jackie.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.192
These have been coming out of
those for millions and millions

00:58.226 --> 00:59.493
of years, you know.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.061
Muscles stretch.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.563
Bones break.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.399
I'm sick of being pregnant.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.734
Well, maybe it's
like a turkey.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.036
You know, when this
comes out, it's ready.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.671
Oh, cut it out.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.039
Don't.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.941
I mean, what if I can't even
make it through the delivery?

01:13.974 --> 01:15.609
What if I'm not strong enough?

01:15.643 --> 01:16.944
I'm scared, Roseanne.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.346
Well, so was I?

01:18.379 --> 01:19.247
You were?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.181
Really?

01:20.214 --> 01:21.915
Well, how did you
get through it?

01:21.949 --> 01:23.684
Well, you just grunt
and groan and scream

01:23.717 --> 01:25.686
and know that it's the
most agonizing thing you're

01:25.719 --> 01:27.421
ever going to go through.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.557
And then you see her
perfect little face,

01:29.590 --> 01:31.259
and you knew it
was all worthwhile.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.726
Heh.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.861
Yeah, whatever.

01:33.894 --> 01:37.765
[theme music]

02:24.077 --> 02:27.114
Roseanne, that was wonderful.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.249
Thanks.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.017
Can you believe that I
got this whole dinner

02:30.050 --> 02:32.653
from one of those banquet
rooms over at the Holiday Inn?

02:32.686 --> 02:35.423
They were just going to
throw this stuff away.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.225
My little Rosie's a
whiz with the leftovers.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.626
Yeah.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.128
Well, I figured this will be one
of your last nights of freedom.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.463
From now on, for the
rest of your lives,

02:42.496 --> 02:44.698
you'll be worried about
that kid every second.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.200
Hey, where are your kids?

02:46.234 --> 02:49.069
Hell if I know.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.204
Oh, by the way,
Fred, if you're

02:50.238 --> 02:52.373
thinking about being
in the delivery room,

02:52.406 --> 02:54.375
things can get a
little wild in there.

02:54.408 --> 02:57.345
You might want to wear a cup.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.679
I'm looking forward to it.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.047
Not only do Jackie
and I get to welcome

03:00.080 --> 03:02.015
this new life that
we created, it's

03:02.049 --> 03:05.152
going to be our third date.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.655
Well, you know, it's a very
stressful time for a woman.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.790
So make sure one of you is
always rubbing my shoulders.

03:12.926 --> 03:16.797
Roseanne, why don't I
help you with the dessert?

03:16.830 --> 03:17.765
Well, where are you going?

03:17.798 --> 03:19.166
The dessert's in here.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.434
I know.

03:20.468 --> 03:25.105
I just thought we should
discuss it before we serve it.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.007
Well, Jackie, now,
if you're having issues

03:27.040 --> 03:28.642
with chocolate cake,
I think you should

03:28.676 --> 03:29.777
confront the cake directly.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.284
Look, it's a really
big deal for Fred

03:36.317 --> 03:39.219
to be in the delivery room
with me when the baby's born.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.254
OK.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.489
But it's going to
be kind of crowded,

03:41.522 --> 03:43.491
because I made big promises
to DJ's science class.

03:46.594 --> 03:50.798
And the hospital only lets
one extra person in the room.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.801
So that means, what,
Fred is the extra person?

03:53.834 --> 03:56.169
Well, I know we always
talked about doing it together,

03:56.203 --> 03:58.572
but it's real important to him.

03:58.606 --> 03:59.773
Well, is that what you want?

03:59.807 --> 04:01.675
Well, I feel like it
is the right thing to do.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.143
I mean, he is the father.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.978
He has rights.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.046
Yeah, that makes sense.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.215
I've only been your
sister for 38 years.

04:08.248 --> 04:13.354
But then, on the other hand, he
did buy you dinner and a movie.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.823
Hey.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.090
I told her.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.459
Roseanne, I know
you're probably

04:18.492 --> 04:20.594
upset you won't be able to be
there when the baby is born.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.729
No, I'm just fine.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.831
DJ Took a bath yesterday,
so I've witnessed

04:23.864 --> 04:26.734
my miracle for the week.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.303
Well, I knew if Jackie
talked to you you'd understand.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.605
I'm sorry.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.675
Hey, if you guys are done
discussing the dessert, I think

04:34.708 --> 04:35.909
it might be fun to eat it.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.380
I'll get it.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.648
Are you all right with this?

04:40.681 --> 04:41.549
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.517
I'm fine.

04:43.551 --> 04:47.621
Hey Fred, you have something
hanging off your chin here.

04:47.655 --> 04:48.656
Oh!

04:48.689 --> 04:49.557
There.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.391
I got it.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.701
BEVERLY: Well, he is
the father, Roseanne.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.636
I know he's the father.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.805
Don't you think I
know he's the father?

05:04.838 --> 05:07.741
Why is everyone so obsessed
about Fred being the father.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.210
Well, the truth is, Roseanne,
she probably doesn't really

05:10.243 --> 05:11.579
need anyone in there.

05:11.612 --> 05:15.215
I read about some foreign women
who do it all on their own.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.950
Well, what if
something goes wrong?

05:16.984 --> 05:19.987
You know, Fred's going to be,
like, totally useless in there.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.489
They all are.

05:21.522 --> 05:26.026
I couldn't even hear my kid
because Dan was crying so loud.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.428
Hi.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.962
How are you doing?

05:28.996 --> 05:29.863
Not good.

05:29.897 --> 05:30.931
I went to step up on a curb.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.667
It took me two tries.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.403
Well, a woman
in your condition

05:35.436 --> 05:37.838
shouldn't be walking anyway.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.239
You're right, mother.

05:39.272 --> 05:43.611
I should have just driven the
car right into the restaurant.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.846
Looks like someone's
a little testy.

05:45.879 --> 05:49.383
I'll be going now.

05:49.417 --> 05:53.821
I tell you, when I
was pregnant with you

05:53.854 --> 05:57.425
and felt a little edgy, I
didn't let it bother me.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.694
I just went home and had
a nice bottle of wine.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.302
I cannot believe she drank
when she was pregnant with us.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.638
Oh, relax, Jackie.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.406
After a few months
inside Mom, we

06:12.440 --> 06:16.076
probably needed a couple shots.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.478
Well, sorry I'm late.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.378
Yes.

06:18.412 --> 06:19.480
So what'd the doctor say?

06:19.513 --> 06:21.081
He said that the
baby's head has dropped

06:21.114 --> 06:22.716
and I'm 2 centimeters dilated.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.684
Wow.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.353
So have you lost
your mucus plug yet?

06:30.157 --> 06:33.494
Ladies, these are customers.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.897
Not if we don't wait
on them, they ain't.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.700
Tell them they're just
people sitting at a counter.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.834
So, did you?

06:40.868 --> 06:41.902
Not yet, I don't think.

06:41.935 --> 06:42.903
What is it anyway?

06:42.936 --> 06:46.540
It's this, like,
hunk of mucus that

06:46.574 --> 06:49.242
sits up there and plugs
up the opening to the,

06:49.276 --> 06:51.178
what do you call it, cervix.

06:51.211 --> 06:55.315
Well, what next to impress
the customers, Roseanne?

06:55.348 --> 06:57.885
Perhaps take one of
the hamburger buns

06:57.918 --> 06:58.952
and use it to loofah your butt.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.595
Well, gee, just
for that, Leon,

07:07.628 --> 07:10.498
you are not getting any of
our homemade placenta shampoo.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.304
Jackie, the counter, please.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.608
Oh my god.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.242
Oh-- [gasp].

07:22.275 --> 07:26.346
My water just broke.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.716
Mom, is she leaking?

07:28.749 --> 07:29.683
What do I do?

07:29.717 --> 07:31.585
Roseanne, tell me what to do.

07:31.619 --> 07:32.720
Well, get your
coat and come on.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.987
OK.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.489
We're taking your car
because Dan just put brand-new

07:35.523 --> 07:37.558
duct tape on my seats.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.492
Oh my god.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.463
It's cause I pushed
her too hard, didn't I?

07:43.497 --> 07:45.065
I mean, Roseanne, I mean--

07:45.098 --> 07:46.299
her water didn't
break because I--

07:46.333 --> 07:47.367
Asked her to wipe the counter?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.268
Yes, it did, Leon.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.538
And I hope you're happy.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.507
Now Jackie is going to have to
go through the agonizing pain

07:53.541 --> 07:54.474
of a dry birth.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.446
I'm ready, I think.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.915
I'm going to have a baby.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.851
I'm gonna be there with you.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.052
DJ, let's move.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.287
Mom, did your water
break when you had me?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.156
By the time I had you,
everything was already broken.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.867
My water just broke.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.703
When anything of mine breaks,
I want to be at the hospital.

08:22.736 --> 08:23.604
Well, yeah.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.805
We're going to the hospital.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.106
I just want to stop
by here and grab

08:26.139 --> 08:30.343
a bag that I packed for you
and some crossword puzzles.

08:30.377 --> 08:33.346
Well, I'll need something
to do between screams.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.515
We don't have time for this.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.517
Yes, we do, Jackie.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.487
I had this very same
thing when I had Becky.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.322
You know, I was standing
right here in the living room.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.456
My water broke.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.859
It was, like, a whole
day before I had her.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.527
Then it was another
12 years before I

08:47.561 --> 08:49.496
could get her to shampoo
that spot out of the carpet.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.002
Well, what if the baby comes?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.303
I'd have to have it here.

08:56.336 --> 08:59.940
I don't want to have my baby
where Dan takes his naps.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.810
Jackie, I would not let you
have your baby on that couch.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.412
You know how many things
we've lost in there.

09:05.445 --> 09:06.880
Oh.
I'm having one.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.215
I'm having one.
- OK.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.149
I'm having one now!

09:09.182 --> 09:10.450
Remember, you breathe in.
Come on.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.484
Breathe in.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.821
Two, three, four, five.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.055
And out.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.625
Two, three, four five.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.127
In.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.028
And out.

09:24.464 --> 09:25.332
It's gone.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.166
You think it's over?

09:28.501 --> 09:29.737
Well, gee.
I don't know.

09:29.770 --> 09:33.173
Do you see a baby around here?

09:33.206 --> 09:34.742
I know it's kind
of late for this,

09:34.775 --> 09:38.011
but I'm starting to rethink
this whole baby thing.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.412
Everything is going
to be great, Jackie.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.081
I promise.
- I'm really scared.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.783
Well, don't you worry about
nothing because I'm going

09:42.816 --> 09:43.884
to be right there with you.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.854
Oh, I don't know what
I'd do without you.

09:46.887 --> 09:47.688
Could you call Fred?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.527
That is exactly what
I was just thinking.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.896
I'm sorry.

09:55.929 --> 09:56.864
No, no, no.

09:56.897 --> 09:57.765
He should be called.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.967
After all, he is the father.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.501
Everyone knows that
he's the father.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.738
They all keep telling
me that he's the father.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.774
He better be the father.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.608
Well, don't get all mad.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.509
I'm not mad.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.244
Don't get sad either.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.146
Well, you've got to pick one.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.748
Well, maybe we don't
have to call Fred yet.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.650
I mean, how much
time do we have left?

10:16.684 --> 10:19.086
Oh, well, I think
you've got about 11,

10:19.119 --> 10:22.656
12 hours of horrifying
unbearable pain

10:22.690 --> 10:24.324
to look forward to.

10:24.357 --> 10:27.828
Unless it's one of
those difficult births.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.163
Well, we'll wait a little
while before we call him.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.599
Because I mean, if he's
going to be alone with me

10:32.632 --> 10:33.967
all during the
delivery, then it's

10:34.001 --> 10:36.269
only fair that you should be
alone with me during the labor.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.106
And that way we can have a
little sister time together.

10:39.139 --> 10:43.343
Well, if that's
your decision, Jackie.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.478
You know, you need to
think about you now.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.781
That's what they taught
you in that Lamaze class

10:47.815 --> 10:50.951
that I drove you to do through
the snow that one time.

10:50.984 --> 10:51.952
I'll tell you what we'll do.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.286
We'll get me to
the hospital, we'll

10:53.320 --> 10:55.956
get me all settled in the
room, and then we'll call Fred.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.090
All right.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.693
Well, if that's what you
want, my hands are tied.

10:59.727 --> 11:03.263
DJ, you entertain her
while I go grab the bag.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.699
OK.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.100
[chuckling]

11:08.668 --> 11:11.638
You know, Grandma says your
baby's going to be a bastard.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.484
We've been here over an hour.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.586
Do you think we
ought to call Fred?

11:26.619 --> 11:27.921
Well, we could call him.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.056
But I mean, you
know, I think it's

11:29.089 --> 11:30.323
going to be a lot more hours.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.624
Are you sure?

11:31.658 --> 11:32.893
Yeah.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.661
I told you, the only women
that give birth real fast

11:34.694 --> 11:36.797
are, like, those
big fat Iowa women

11:36.830 --> 11:38.631
that don't even know they're
pregnant in the first place.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.237
- Harris.
- Over here.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.176
What's the problem?

11:49.209 --> 11:52.312
Uh, well, I have
a dull headache.

11:52.345 --> 11:57.951
And she's about to spew forth
a human being from her loins.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.187
Oh, here we go again.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.388
Oh!

12:01.421 --> 12:04.157
No, you cannot be having
a contraction already.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.258
It's only been one minute.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.328
You're still four minutes apart.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.162
She's a bit of a whiner.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.033
Insurance?

12:13.066 --> 12:13.934
No, no.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.035
We don't have any insurance.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.637
But we do have this
public aid medical card.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.039
Oh, gee.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.540
You know, I'm afraid we're not
going to be able to take you.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.010
We've met our quota of public
aid cases for the year.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.111
Oh, terrific.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.712
Well, then can you point
us in the direction

12:25.745 --> 12:26.579
of the nearest manger?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.152
I'll arrange for an
ambulance to take you

12:32.185 --> 12:33.220
over to the county hospital.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.154
County?

12:34.187 --> 12:36.023
No, I can't have
my baby at County.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.358
I don't want my kid born
next to a gunshot victim.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.726
I'm sorry.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.095
But unless this is an emergency,
I have to follow the rules.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.230
We're not going to County.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.731
County is dangerous.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.266
We wouldn't even
visit our own mother

12:46.299 --> 12:48.035
when we put her in there.

12:48.068 --> 12:48.936
Oh god.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.337
It's coming again.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.604
Oh.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.773
I think maybe those contractions
are one minute apart.

12:53.807 --> 12:54.908
I know.

12:54.942 --> 12:59.279
I'm-- I'm having one of
those emergency births.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.649
I think we'd better
admit you right away.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.716
Yeah.

13:03.750 --> 13:04.852
Good work.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.419
We're in.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.088
Next time don't
lay it on so thick.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.124
You sound more like a cow.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.592
I'm not faking.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.894
That's impossible.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.362
This is your first baby.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.197
Everyone knows that takes hours.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.098
Oh, no, no, no.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.432
Not necessarily.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.234
I mean, with all the pain she's
having, I think it will be

13:21.268 --> 13:23.036
real soon.
- I'm not ready.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.071
Fred's not here yet.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.472
Well, you know, I'll call him.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.439
I'll get Fred here.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.507
He's going to miss
the whole thing.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.775
You told me I would
have a lot of time.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.676
You lied to me.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.078
I did not lie to you.

13:31.111 --> 13:34.414
I've had three kids, and it took
the usual three or four days.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.715
It's not my fault
you're a freak.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.051
Well, you've gotta call Fred.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.452
I will call Fred.

13:39.486 --> 13:43.390
Just get in the chair and shut
up and keep your legs together.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.291
Hey, hey, hey.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.825
My beeper just went off.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.929
My liver's ready.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.430
Oh, help, mommy!

13:50.463 --> 13:53.400
[groaning]

13:53.433 --> 13:55.535
Hi, is Fred there?

13:55.568 --> 13:57.370
Oh, he's not?

13:57.404 --> 13:58.939
Well, as soon as he
gets back, tell him

13:58.972 --> 14:01.274
he's got to get to the hospital
right away because Jackie's

14:01.308 --> 14:02.242
having the baby.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.811
And tell him I
called an hour ago.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.146
How's it going?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.080
Jackie's in labor.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.481
Yeah, I know.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.251
I came home for lunch, and DJ
told me her water heater broke.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.619
I was halfway to
her house to fix it

14:12.652 --> 14:14.854
when I realized what he meant.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.189
I mean, she's in
the delivery room.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.190
It could happen any minute.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.091
Yeah.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.526
Where's Fred?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.561
Fred, well, it's so weird.

14:21.594 --> 14:22.862
You know, I mean,
me and Jackie were

14:22.896 --> 14:24.264
just talking and everything.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.433
And we just thought we'd
have more sister time.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.335
And I mean, how was I supposed
to know she's like one

14:28.368 --> 14:30.971
of the fat ladies in Iowa?

14:31.004 --> 14:33.373
Fred doesn't know, does he?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.675
Man, I knew you wanted to
be in the delivery room,

14:35.708 --> 14:37.844
but I never thought
you'd sink this low.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.745
You don't understand.

14:38.778 --> 14:39.679
It didn't happen like that.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.780
Well, then how
did that happen?

14:40.813 --> 14:42.415
What possible excuse
could you have?

14:42.449 --> 14:43.816
I don't believe you, Dan.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.885
You expect me to sit here and
make up excuses when you should

14:45.919 --> 14:46.987
be out there looking for Fred?

14:47.020 --> 14:48.255
I don't know where
to look for Fred.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.923
Well, you better
think of someplace,

14:49.957 --> 14:51.158
because if he misses
this delivery,

14:51.191 --> 14:52.292
I am going to have to
live with that guilt

14:52.325 --> 14:53.660
for the rest of my life.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.528
And it will eat at me and eat
at me until it destroys you.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.906
[door opening]

15:08.008 --> 15:09.742
Did Roseanne find Fred yet?

15:09.776 --> 15:11.544
No.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.547
My goodness, I've heard of
being left at the altar,

15:14.581 --> 15:18.318
but I've never heard of
being left in the stirrups.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.553
[chuckling]

15:22.489 --> 15:23.923
Laugh while you
can, old woman.

15:26.693 --> 15:31.564
Oh, Jackie, I think the pain
has killed your sense of humor.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.966
I'm not having any pain.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.201
I had an epidural.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.102
See?

15:35.135 --> 15:37.504
I have--

15:42.042 --> 15:45.678
I bet I could get my
foot behind my head.

15:45.712 --> 15:49.516
Oh, my-- who put these
booties on my feet?

15:49.549 --> 15:51.184
I did when you
weren't looking.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.085
They're hideous.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.720
Get them off.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.256
Jackie, you haven't
shaved your legs.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.457
My god.

15:57.490 --> 16:02.729
The baby is liable to
be born with rug burn.

16:02.762 --> 16:03.997
Mother!

16:04.031 --> 16:06.933
Can we talk about
something else?

16:06.966 --> 16:07.834
All right.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.102
Have you thought about names?

16:09.136 --> 16:11.371
No, I haven't decided yet.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.973
Here I am about to give
birth, I haven't even

16:14.007 --> 16:15.908
decided on a name for my baby.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.145
Oh, now don't
get all worked up.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.881
Just name it the first thing
that comes into your mind.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.883
You can always change it later.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.186
You can't change it later.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.120
Well, of course you can.

16:27.154 --> 16:31.324
We don't call you
Marjorie, do we?

16:31.358 --> 16:32.992
Why would you
call me Marjorie?

16:33.026 --> 16:35.395
Because that used
to be your name.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.230
Only Roseanne
couldn't pronounce it.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.766
She kept calling
you "My Jackie."

16:39.799 --> 16:42.635
We thought it was so
cute, we all started

16:42.669 --> 16:44.904
calling you "My Jackie."

16:44.937 --> 16:47.140
And after a while, you
just became Jackie.

16:55.515 --> 16:59.686
My name used to be Marjorie?

16:59.719 --> 17:00.620
Yes.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.954
It probably still is.

17:01.988 --> 17:05.692
I think that's what's written
on your birth certificate.

17:05.725 --> 17:06.993
You don't even
know my own name?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.961
You're supposed to be my mother.

17:08.995 --> 17:11.698
Oh, we told you
all this years ago.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.033
No, you never
told-- no, never.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.836
Never, never, never,
never told me that.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.206
Now Jackie, don't
upset yourself.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.607
It's no big deal.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.508
It's no big deal?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.310
It's my name!

17:23.343 --> 17:26.079
You go ask 1,000 people if
they think that's a big deal,

17:26.113 --> 17:26.979
they're going to say yes.

17:27.013 --> 17:30.783
That is a very big deal.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.718
Or was it Mary Jane?

17:40.093 --> 17:41.094
Hey, did you find him?

17:41.128 --> 17:41.994
Yeah.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.563
He's in Elgin.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.098
He won't be back
for three hours.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.166
Three hours?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.235
Oh my god, she's ready
to pop any minute.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.136
Sorry.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.737
Oh my god.

17:50.770 --> 17:51.804
He's going to miss this.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.706
He's going to miss
the birth of his baby.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.941
And he'll never
get over it, Dan.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.643
He'll never get
this moment back.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.645
And it's all my fault. I'm,
like, the most horrible

17:58.678 --> 17:59.479
person that ever lived.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.151
Where is she?

18:04.184 --> 18:04.984
Right there.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.391
Yeah, I think you
had that coming.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.233
Yeah.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.134
You're right.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.034
And you had that coming.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.039
Where's Fred?

18:27.073 --> 18:28.107
He's scrubbing up.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.376
Thanks for getting him for me.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.945
Roseanne, did you know my
name used to be Marjorie?

18:32.979 --> 18:34.347
Well, how we
feeling Miss Harris?

18:34.381 --> 18:36.149
- OK.
- Let's take a look at you.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.450
Mm-hmm.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.152
I apologize for her legs.

18:39.186 --> 18:42.722
I told her to shave them.

18:42.755 --> 18:43.623
Just as I thought.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.524
You're fully dilated.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.558
This baby is ready to be born.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.459
Really?

18:46.493 --> 18:47.594
Oh, the baby's ready.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.928
Yep.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.431
Now, I need everybody out
except for the coaching partner.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.332
OK.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.666
Bye, dear.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.802
Good luck.

18:55.835 --> 18:56.869
I'll be pacing.

18:56.903 --> 18:57.970
Bye bye.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.639
Whoa, stirrup alert.
Let's go, Roseanne.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.707
Yeah, I'm coming.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.108
Are you OK?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.410
- Yeah, I think so.
- OK.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.911
Well, don't you worry about
nothing because everything

19:04.944 --> 19:06.279
is going to be just fine.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.514
I'm just right out there.
- OK.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.548
I love you, Roseanne.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.184
I love you too, Marjorie.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.986
Bye bye.

19:14.020 --> 19:18.725
Uh, good luck, Fred.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.428
And I'm sorry that I
didn't call you sooner.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.463
Look, Roseanne, I'm not going
to forgive you right now, OK?

19:23.496 --> 19:24.531
So don't even try.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.632
We'll talk about it later.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.434
Don't say that to her.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.901
Don't get yourself
all upset now, Jackie.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.270
Well, he shouldn't
be mad at you.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.572
It's my fault. I wanted her to
be a part of this all along.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.807
Well, I really need everyone
else to clear the room now.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.476
Bad enough she has
to miss the delivery.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.177
Look, Jackie, if you
wanted Roseanne here,

19:38.211 --> 19:40.012
you should have just told me.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.448
Hey Fred, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime

19:41.481 --> 19:42.549
thing for you.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.083
I'm sure the father
of Jackie's next baby

19:44.116 --> 19:45.418
will let me come in
the delivery room.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.557
Look, Jackie, if you're
going to resent me,

19:50.590 --> 19:51.491
then I should just go.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.892
No.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.594
No way, because then I'm going
to feel all horrible guilt. No,

19:54.627 --> 19:55.495
I'm going.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.696
No, don't everybody go.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.598
You're going to have to
ask one of them to leave.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.433
Well, why do I have
to make this decision?

20:00.467 --> 20:01.668
I'm the one having the baby.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.370
This is a really
stressful time for me.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.705
You're asking me to
choose between the father

20:05.738 --> 20:08.275
and the person who's most
important to me in my life.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.444
Oh, mama, my epidural
is wearing off.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.345
OK.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.313
All right.

20:13.346 --> 20:16.015
Now look, her sister is staying.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.950
You want me to leave, you're
going to have to physically

20:17.984 --> 20:19.386
throw me out of the room.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.353
You can't be serious.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.621
Go ahead and try it.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.691
You're going to be glad
you're already in a hospital.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.092
OK, fine.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.460
I don't have time to argue.

20:27.494 --> 20:30.630
Look, just put on a gown and
get out of my way, all right?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.064
Quite a man you've got there.

20:32.098 --> 20:32.965
Yeah.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.334
He's my protector.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.503
You're starting to tear, so
I'm going to have to cut you.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.271
Holy cow.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.312
[heart beating]

20:45.345 --> 20:46.346
DOCTOR: OK, Jackie.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.780
Now push.

20:47.814 --> 20:48.748
JACKIE: Oh!

20:48.781 --> 20:50.216
It's not coming.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.151
ROSEANNE: Hey,
remember what they

20:52.184 --> 20:53.620
taught us in Lamaze, Jackie.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.054
Visualize, visualize.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.991
Imagine a bowling ball
going through a garden hose.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.794
DOCTOR: I can see the head.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.730
ROSEANNE: Jackie,
it's got a head!

21:03.763 --> 21:05.465
JACKIE: Oh!

21:05.498 --> 21:06.366
Oh, god.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.367
DOCTOR: Oh, Jackie.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.435
It's beautiful.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.336
JACKIE: Is it OK?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.203
DOCTOR: It's perfect.

21:11.237 --> 21:12.204
It's a boy.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.172
Oh, it's a boy?

21:13.205 --> 21:15.675
Oh, it's a baby boy.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.776
Hi!

21:16.809 --> 21:17.610
Hi!

21:21.213 --> 21:24.183
Oh!

21:24.216 --> 21:28.688
Oh, I'm your-- I'm your mommy!

21:28.721 --> 21:29.689
Can I hold him?

21:29.722 --> 21:32.191
I want to hold him.

21:32.224 --> 21:35.695
Oh, hello, baby.

21:35.728 --> 21:39.899
I'm your Aunt Roseanne!

21:39.932 --> 21:43.470
[baby screaming]
