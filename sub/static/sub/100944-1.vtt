02:12.264 --> 02:14.400
[country tune playing]

02:46.932 --> 02:49.202
[man 1]
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

02:49.235 --> 02:50.536
[man 2]
Agh!

02:50.569 --> 02:51.804
[man 1] Calm down!

02:51.837 --> 02:54.374
[man 3]
I'm OK, bro. We're OK.

02:55.941 --> 02:57.577
[waitress]
What can I getcha, doll?

02:57.610 --> 02:59.345
Y'know what?
I'm gonna go with a ginger ale.

02:59.378 --> 03:01.247
-[laughs]
-Y'know what? Make it a diet.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.417
-[both laugh]
-Yeah, I gotta check
if we have that.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.719
-OK, you do that.
-A beer if we don't?

03:06.752 --> 03:10.523
I'm gonna take it up a notch
and go with a water. OK?

03:10.556 --> 03:12.758
-[guitar tuning]
-[glass shatters]

03:12.791 --> 03:14.194
[angry voices]

03:17.830 --> 03:20.833
-[man] How many times have I...
-[Irv] French!

03:20.866 --> 03:22.902
Brother, are you gonna
do somethin' about this?

03:22.935 --> 03:25.571
Fuckin' prick.
Y'all fuckin' prick!

03:25.604 --> 03:27.473
A'right, a'right.
Break it up. Break it up.

03:27.506 --> 03:29.342
Let him go.
Take it outside. Yeah?

03:29.375 --> 03:32.345
-Get outside now!
-Fuck off, Harry Stiles.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.580
-This don't concern you.
-Listen, mate.

03:34.613 --> 03:36.949
You can kick seven shades
of shite out of each other,
for all I care,

03:36.982 --> 03:39.986
but you're doin' outside.
Otherwise it is my concern!

03:40.019 --> 03:42.488
-[rock band soundcheck]
-Who the fuck do you
think you are?

03:42.521 --> 03:44.724
-Ugh!
-French... don't do it.

03:45.724 --> 03:47.293
Now listen to me.

03:47.326 --> 03:49.629
-[cymbal clangs]
-Calm down, OK? You see him?

03:49.662 --> 03:52.365
See that guy? His name's Irv,
and that's my boss.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.300
Now, he's given me
strict instructions.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.669
You gotta take all violence
outside the premises. OK, lads?

03:56.702 --> 03:59.472
Because I've had a few
unfortunate events over
the past few weeks,

03:59.505 --> 04:01.274
and I've caused a bit
of damage, and...

04:01.307 --> 04:03.276
I promised him I'm gonna
turn over a new leaf, OK?

04:03.309 --> 04:06.646
So, please. Take it outside
and let me finish my breakfast.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.881
-A'right?
-[chuckles]

04:08.914 --> 04:11.384
What d'you reckon, lads?

04:11.417 --> 04:15.554
Shall we match his faggy,
English ass outside?

04:15.587 --> 04:17.555
Like we did 100 years ago?

04:17.589 --> 04:20.826
More like 250 years, I think.
But that's by the by, isn't it?

04:20.858 --> 04:23.996
Anyway... wasn't exactly
fair fight back then, was it?

04:24.029 --> 04:26.332
It was us against you,

04:26.365 --> 04:30.703
and we kicked your
sorry asses all the way
back across the Atlantic!

04:30.736 --> 04:32.371
-Nah, you didn't, mate.
-[mocking] Sent you home crying

04:32.404 --> 04:34.874
to your bitch queen!

04:34.907 --> 04:36.976
-[laughs]
-Nah, they didn't, mate.

04:37.009 --> 04:38.944
Well, it wasn't a queen,
actually, mate.

04:38.977 --> 04:40.479
No, it was a king.

04:40.512 --> 04:42.315
King George III to be precise.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.317
But, well, I wouldn't expect
you lot to know that.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.085
I mean, you probably never read
a book in your life, have ya?

04:46.118 --> 04:49.588
So, allow me to educate
ye geriatric Yank fucks.

04:49.621 --> 04:51.791
See, you had help
from the Spanish...

04:51.824 --> 04:54.093
the French... oh, and the Dutch.

04:54.126 --> 04:56.095
And yeah, all right. We might've
taken a bit of a kickin',

04:56.128 --> 04:57.830
but the odds were
against our boys.

04:57.863 --> 04:59.498
Just like they are against me
now, to be honest.

04:59.531 --> 05:00.666
But d'you know what?

05:00.699 --> 05:02.535
I fuckin' like these odds.

05:02.568 --> 05:04.770
'Cause like good ol' King George
always used to say,

05:04.803 --> 05:07.073
"Come and fucking get it!"

05:07.106 --> 05:09.342
[grunts and blows]

05:09.375 --> 05:11.811
[rock music playing]

05:46.979 --> 05:50.083
[grunting and groaning
continues]

05:55.053 --> 05:56.689
On your six, Frenchie!

06:04.430 --> 06:05.464
Cheers, mate!

06:05.497 --> 06:06.866
I gotta tell you somethin', pal.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.668
You still got it.
You got every move [kiss].

06:09.701 --> 06:10.770
-The fuck?
-Uhh!

06:12.704 --> 06:15.441
[grunting]

06:27.686 --> 06:29.021
[band stops playing]

06:29.054 --> 06:30.589
I thought you were dead.

06:30.622 --> 06:32.091
Well, so did I,
Frenchie. Believe me.

06:32.124 --> 06:33.492
A story for another time.

06:33.525 --> 06:34.727
[coughing and groaning]

06:37.129 --> 06:39.665
[Irv]
Outside, French! A word.

06:39.698 --> 06:41.867
[coughing and groaning]

06:41.900 --> 06:43.603
I love this fuckin' place!

06:44.636 --> 06:45.871
Mmm!

06:45.904 --> 06:48.174
Don't do this, OK?
I need this job.

06:48.207 --> 06:49.909
I need it, mate.
Please, don't do this.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.610
And I need a club

06:51.643 --> 06:53.446
that doesn't have to be
renovated once a week

06:53.479 --> 06:55.781
'cause of what you do.

06:55.814 --> 06:58.951
Listen, brother. After the cost
of the busted-up furniture,

06:58.984 --> 07:00.953
and your unpaid bar tab,

07:00.986 --> 07:02.755
there's 80 bucks.

07:02.788 --> 07:04.056
Good luck.

07:04.089 --> 07:06.792
Oh, 80 bucks, yeah? Yeah?

07:06.825 --> 07:08.928
Well, good luck findin'
someone else to scrape up

07:08.961 --> 07:10.663
the shit that comes
in this place!

07:10.696 --> 07:11.798
It's a shit hole, mate!

07:13.565 --> 07:14.767
[clears throat, sniffs]

07:16.635 --> 07:18.737
Was nice to see that things
are workin' out for you, pal.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.606
I'm very happy about that, I am.

07:20.639 --> 07:22.775
Hey y'know,
what it's worth, if, uh,

07:22.808 --> 07:24.577
if you wanna
finish that breakfast,

07:24.610 --> 07:26.846
there's a place next door.
Maybe we can, you know...

07:26.879 --> 07:28.113
Why, are you buyin'?

07:28.146 --> 07:29.649
Since you got no job no more...

07:30.616 --> 07:31.684
why not?

07:32.951 --> 07:34.020
Come on, Frenchie.

07:37.556 --> 07:39.192
It's still just "French,"
by the way!

07:46.899 --> 07:48.201
[Sue]
Mmm. [sniffs]

07:49.635 --> 07:52.638
Mmm. Ahh.
[sniffs, clears throat]

07:53.972 --> 07:56.575
-Mmmm!
-I can't believe it.

07:56.608 --> 07:58.744
I can't believe you're
sat right here in front of me.

07:58.777 --> 08:01.180
I thought for sure
that you were a goner.

08:01.213 --> 08:03.215
Mm, believe me, I was.

08:03.248 --> 08:04.783
Flat-lined two times
on that slab.

08:04.816 --> 08:06.619
-Yeah?
-Mm-mm.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.254
-Jesus.
-If it wasn't for Tommy,

08:08.287 --> 08:09.855
I probably wouldn't
be here right now.

08:09.888 --> 08:12.825
Paid a lot of money
to make me undead. Yeah.

08:12.858 --> 08:14.593
Got shot up
pretty bad, Frenchie.

08:14.626 --> 08:17.229
Stomach, one vertebra.

08:17.262 --> 08:19.899
One up here in the lung.
Can you imagine? Yeah?

08:19.932 --> 08:22.234
Actually, had to leave
one in near my spine.

08:22.267 --> 08:24.837
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

08:24.870 --> 08:27.306
Well, kudos to you, mate,
because, uh, y'know what?

08:27.339 --> 08:29.742
As far as zombies go...

08:29.775 --> 08:30.910
you're lookin' all right.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.313
Hm. Mmm.

08:34.346 --> 08:35.748
So, where's my coupe?

08:38.082 --> 08:39.618
Oh, I'm fine, Sue.

08:39.650 --> 08:40.919
Don't worry
about the injuries I took.

08:40.953 --> 08:41.986
Yeah, thanks for asking.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.255
Oh, no, no. It's not like that.

08:43.288 --> 08:44.723
See, I just--because
of the, um--

08:44.756 --> 08:46.091
Oh, c'mon, Frenchie.

08:46.124 --> 08:47.560
How you doin'?
Really, I'm sorry.

08:47.593 --> 08:48.661
Just--How you doin'?

08:48.694 --> 08:49.828
-I'm all right.
-Yeah?

08:49.861 --> 08:51.330
-I'm pretty good.
-Yeah?

08:51.363 --> 08:54.934
Took two in the chest.
One here, one there.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.268
I dunno how,
but I somehow managed

08:56.301 --> 08:57.803
to crawl back
to the car, all right,

08:57.836 --> 08:59.238
and drive myself
to the emergency room.

08:59.271 --> 09:02.074
-Well.
-I was surprisingly all right.

09:02.107 --> 09:04.944
I mean, I've seen a soldier
shoot himself in the foot,
and he died.

09:04.977 --> 09:07.780
Yet I take two in the chest
and somehow manage to live
to tell the tale.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.316
Human body, mate, it's a fucked
up thing, I'm telling you.

09:10.349 --> 09:11.951
-I'll tell you this as well.
-Mm-hmm?

09:11.984 --> 09:14.019
Had to blag the police
at the hospital, though.

09:14.052 --> 09:16.589
Told 'em my gun went off,
whilst I was cleaning it.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.923
[laughs]

09:17.956 --> 09:19.592
Bet they bought that,
am I right?

09:19.625 --> 09:21.660
[chuckles]
They did. I dunno.

09:21.693 --> 09:23.262
Maybe they couldn't be
arsed with the paperwork.

09:23.295 --> 09:24.664
Well...

09:25.130 --> 09:26.232
Hmm.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.269
So, where's my coupe?

09:33.038 --> 09:35.274
Didn't shoot out that
loving bedside manner
of yours, did they?

09:35.307 --> 09:36.842
Frenchie, where's
my fuckin' car?

09:38.377 --> 09:39.945
I fuckin' sold that car, mate.

09:39.978 --> 09:41.947
You did what?
You did what--[stuttering]

09:41.980 --> 09:44.216
With who? With what? What?

09:44.249 --> 09:46.719
I sold the car
to a chop shop, didn't I?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.120
Didn't have
a fuckin' choice, did I?

09:48.153 --> 09:49.688
It was covered
in my blood, wasn't it?

09:49.721 --> 09:51.256
Listen, that was like a bullseye

09:51.289 --> 09:52.758
for every gangster in East LA.

09:52.791 --> 09:53.692
So, I flogged that thing.

09:53.725 --> 09:54.994
Lemme ask you somethin'.

09:55.027 --> 09:57.096
By chance, how much...
did you sell

09:57.129 --> 09:59.131
this classically-designed
vehicle for?

10:00.666 --> 10:02.067
Dunno, it was about six grand.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.370
[hits table] Fuck me,
Frenchie! Six grand?

10:04.403 --> 10:07.973
Six--Just the fuckin' rims alone
are worth six fuckin' grand!

10:08.006 --> 10:09.175
-You understand me, right?
-Hey.

10:10.976 --> 10:14.113
I am sorry.
Everything is under control.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.348
My apologies.

10:18.283 --> 10:20.252
You know, you're unbelievable.

10:20.285 --> 10:22.087
-And I don't like
this--this tone.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.857
-What tone?
-This tone.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.825
-I haven't got a fuckin' tone.
What you talkin' about?
-Oh yeah, you do. You do.

10:26.858 --> 10:29.028
I come as a friend, I catch the
bus to come and see my friend.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.196
I come all this way,
and you give me this... tone.

10:31.229 --> 10:33.999
No, you caught the bus,
mate, to come and get
your precious coupe.

10:34.032 --> 10:35.768
Hey, is that the only reason
you come here, then?

10:35.801 --> 10:38.137
Actually, no. It's not
the only reason.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.005
I came for Tommy.
He's got a job for us.

10:40.038 --> 10:41.373
Two days, three vigs.

10:41.406 --> 10:43.242
We're in, we're out.
What do you say?

10:46.244 --> 10:48.080
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

10:50.449 --> 10:51.784
OK.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.719
Fuck off, mate. Yeah?

10:53.752 --> 10:55.921
D'you know what? I only did
that job for three days,

10:55.954 --> 10:57.456
we both almost fucking died!

10:57.489 --> 10:58.724
No chance.

10:58.757 --> 10:59.892
Get stuffed.

10:59.925 --> 11:01.960
"Never again. Can't do it!"

11:01.993 --> 11:03.462
Listen to you, right?

11:03.495 --> 11:05.064
Let me tell you somethin' else.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.933
It's a favor for Tommy.
You owe him.

11:07.966 --> 11:09.902
No, I don't think I do.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.470
OK. Tell you what.

11:11.503 --> 11:13.839
I'll do it for Tommy,
you can do it for the money.

11:13.872 --> 11:15.474
[scoffs] I ain't
that desperate, mate.

11:15.507 --> 11:17.876
Oh yeah? We both know
that's not true. Right?

11:17.909 --> 11:20.379
C'mon, French, think about it.
Get to split $70K.

11:22.447 --> 11:24.183
How much?

11:24.216 --> 11:26.251
-Hm?
-How much?

11:26.284 --> 11:27.920
Seventy K.

11:27.953 --> 11:29.855
One more job,
and you can be gone forever.

11:29.888 --> 11:32.091
You can go home and do whatever
it is the fuck you wanna do.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.159
You can open your gym.

11:34.192 --> 11:35.728
Besides, Frenchie,
you know I need this one.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.063
You'd be doing me
a square one, yeah?

11:38.096 --> 11:39.965
I'm gettin' nowhere with
the 'just call me French'
thing, am I?

11:39.998 --> 11:41.400
It's a term of endearment.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.869
Yeah. Whatever, Susan.

11:45.437 --> 11:47.005
One last job.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.941
-Yeah.
-Three last jobs.

11:50.442 --> 11:52.878
While you think about it,
I tell you what.

11:52.911 --> 11:55.080
Per our previous discussion.

11:55.113 --> 11:56.248
I'll take care of breakfast.

11:57.549 --> 11:59.518
[paper shuffles]

11:59.551 --> 12:01.353
I might leave another $20.

12:01.386 --> 12:03.922
Why? Because I can.

12:03.955 --> 12:05.491
You want more of this?

12:05.524 --> 12:06.759
I'll see you outside.

12:07.392 --> 12:10.929
[footsteps recede]

12:10.962 --> 12:12.865
[French] So, what have you been
doin' for the past seven months?

12:12.898 --> 12:15.434
You know, apart from
rising from the dead?

12:15.467 --> 12:17.903
You ever think it might
be a nice idea to, uh,

12:17.936 --> 12:19.338
let me know
you were still alive?

12:19.371 --> 12:20.973
Well, I did consider
doing that, Frenchie,

12:21.006 --> 12:22.407
but Tommy told me
to remain incognito,

12:22.440 --> 12:24.009
so that's what I did, yeah?

12:24.042 --> 12:25.778
Yeah, he said the same thing
to me, too.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.946
That's why I've been
working outta this shit pit.

12:27.979 --> 12:29.381
What a coincidence!

12:29.414 --> 12:31.250
I get fired the same day
you turn up.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.119

12:36.421 --> 12:37.957
Whoa, wait a minute.
What the fuck is this?

12:40.025 --> 12:41.059
It's called a car, mate.

12:41.092 --> 12:42.227
No, it's a wheelchair

12:42.260 --> 12:43.929
with a fuckin' roof, Frenchie.

12:43.962 --> 12:46.365
You traded in my classic
for this piece of shit?

12:46.398 --> 12:47.966
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

12:47.999 --> 12:49.868
It doesn't drink gas
like a battleship,

12:49.901 --> 12:51.203
it's clean, it's quiet.

12:51.236 --> 12:52.838
And it doesn't smell
like your arse

12:52.871 --> 12:54.339
on the inside. All right?

12:54.372 --> 12:55.908
Now look, if we're gonna
do this, I'm gonna have to

12:55.941 --> 12:57.109
go home and get
a change of clothes.

12:57.142 --> 12:58.243
Oh, no, no, no.
Got no time

12:58.276 --> 12:59.278
for you to change, OK?

12:59.311 --> 13:00.279
You look beautiful.

13:00.312 --> 13:01.346
On a time schedule.

13:01.379 --> 13:02.447
Where are we off to first then?

13:02.480 --> 13:05.083
Las Vegas. Is that OK with you?

13:05.116 --> 13:06.218
-Vegas?
-Vegas.

No, I don't like that one.

13:32.544 --> 13:34.479
Nah, that's a bit shit, uh?

13:34.512 --> 13:37.049
I like, uh, rock music.

13:37.082 --> 13:38.417
All right, Frenchie, how about

13:38.450 --> 13:40.319
we take it easy
with the DJ'ing, eh?

13:40.352 --> 13:42.487

-[music stops]
-[Sue chuckles] Oh.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.593
So, where are we headed to
in Vegas then, mate?

13:47.626 --> 13:49.228
We're stickin' with a vig.

13:49.261 --> 13:50.863
Oh, the ol' vig, eh?

13:52.063 --> 13:53.966
So, we are...

13:55.500 --> 13:57.369
Have a look, Frenchie.
My specs must've...

13:59.671 --> 14:01.139
Hang on a minute.

14:01.172 --> 14:03.242
Vegas is number two
on this list.

14:03.275 --> 14:06.045
How come we're goin' there first
and who's this Mal Reese bird?

14:06.945 --> 14:08.347
Little tip, Frenchie.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.182
Always start farthest away
from home

14:10.215 --> 14:11.584
and work your way back, yeah?

14:13.184 --> 14:15.287
Mal Reese...

14:15.320 --> 14:18.891
Mal Reese is a bona fide
class act outta Louisiana, yeah?

14:18.924 --> 14:20.525
Her old man moved here
when he was a kid, Frenchie,

14:20.558 --> 14:22.594
to work for
the Ukrainian Crime Family.

14:22.627 --> 14:25.297
Wasn't a pure-bred,
so one day he got an OBE.

14:25.330 --> 14:27.132
"One behind the ear."

14:27.165 --> 14:30.369
Anyways, it was the mid-80s.
Mal was in her late 20s.

14:30.402 --> 14:33.171
So, she started working for
the Family under an alias. Yeah?

14:33.204 --> 14:34.506
Pretty smart girl, Frenchie.

14:34.539 --> 14:36.308
She knew everything, where

14:36.341 --> 14:39.344
every penny was banked,
where every body was buried.

14:39.377 --> 14:41.146
[Sue] After a time,
she'd developed a lot of power.

14:41.179 --> 14:44.283
Slowly but surely, she became
very rich, very powerful.

14:44.316 --> 14:45.984
Then one day [snaps fingers]...

14:46.017 --> 14:47.920
she decides to wipe out
the whole fuckin' family.

14:49.621 --> 14:52.658

15:03.435 --> 15:04.670
[French]
How do you know all this, then?

15:04.703 --> 15:06.471
I mean, the Urfalian family--

15:06.504 --> 15:08.507
I've never heard of 'em.

15:08.540 --> 15:11.343
I had this on-and-off thing
with her for about three years.

15:11.376 --> 15:14.012
She was the best fuck
on the West Coast.

15:14.045 --> 15:15.681

am I right?

15:22.520 --> 15:24.289

15:24.322 --> 15:26.358
-Are you serious?
-Don't fuckin' say anything,

15:26.391 --> 15:27.993
don't even hint
you know anything. OK?

15:28.026 --> 15:29.428
'Cause if she looks
in your eyes,

15:29.461 --> 15:31.263
and she thinks that I
told you a fuckin' word,

15:31.296 --> 15:32.431
she'll kill us both.

15:32.464 --> 15:34.132
I mean it, yeah?

15:34.165 --> 15:36.068
Fuckin' sounds like
a right crazy bitch to me.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.703
Oh, she is, Frenchie,
but I don't wanna wind up

15:37.736 --> 15:39.504
hurting her, you know.
Physically, I mean.

15:39.537 --> 15:42.307
I'm done with the violence,
brother. I'm done.

15:42.340 --> 15:43.709
Done with violence?
What's that supposed to mean?

15:43.742 --> 15:45.711
It means no more hurtin'
my fellow man.

15:45.744 --> 15:48.146
[laughs]
"No more hurtin' my fellow man"?

15:48.179 --> 15:49.414
You takin' the piss, mate?

15:49.447 --> 15:51.116
No, I'm not takin' the piss!

15:51.149 --> 15:52.718
What I'm tryin' to tell you
is maybe, OK?

15:52.751 --> 15:54.419
Maybe, if it's fucking
life-threatening!

15:54.452 --> 15:55.754
Well, good luck
with that, mate. Yeah.

15:55.787 --> 15:57.155
We'll see how you
get on with that.

15:57.188 --> 15:58.724
Answer me this though, right?

15:58.757 --> 16:02.361
How do you expect to clear
three vigs in two days,

16:02.394 --> 16:04.096
and not get
your little paws muddy?

16:04.129 --> 16:05.163

No. No-no-no-no-no. No, no, no.

warmin' up the bench,

in the thick of it again.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.142
Let's hope it doesn't
get to that.

16:17.175 --> 16:19.111
But it probably fucking will,
won't it? Let's be honest.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.380

at the next stop, Frenchie.

In my club,
you call me Miss Reese.

Miss Reese, please.

22:49.667 --> 22:52.637

22:52.670 --> 22:54.639
What is your name, little boy?

22:54.672 --> 22:56.541
It's, uh, it's French.

22:56.574 --> 22:58.443
They call him French,
just like the kiss.

22:58.476 --> 23:01.947
-You cut me off, Mr. French.
-It's just French, by the way.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.883
OK, listen. Mallory,

23:04.916 --> 23:06.885

Film Mr. French checking
the money's all there

Y'know what, Mallory,
maybe you should keep filming

D'you know what I mean?

32:59.810 --> 33:01.512
So anyway, there she is.

33:01.545 --> 33:04.315
She cut off my jeans,
she cut off my underwear.

33:04.348 --> 33:09.720
And before I know it,
I am stark, bollock naked. OK?

33:09.753 --> 33:11.255
Now, here's the thing.

33:13.090 --> 33:15.393
I'm not a small man, Sue. OK?

33:15.426 --> 33:17.194
I'm no thoroughbred
stallion either,

33:17.227 --> 33:19.030
but it's a perfectly
healthy size, right?

33:19.063 --> 33:20.498
But the thing is...

33:20.531 --> 33:24.335
it is so fucking cold
in this place, right?

33:24.368 --> 33:27.038
My old fella has decided
to shrink back

33:27.071 --> 33:29.740
into his hole to the size
of a little nub.

33:29.773 --> 33:34.678
Right? It was like a fucking
thimble, mate. It was pathetic.

33:34.711 --> 33:38.182
I mean, just when you want him
to, like, stand up proud...

33:39.249 --> 33:40.551
nothin'.

33:40.584 --> 33:42.520
It's fuckin' embarassin'.

33:42.553 --> 33:44.688
Well, if I may, Frenchie,
I must admit that, uh,

33:44.721 --> 33:46.724
it would make
any man blush, yeah?

33:48.525 --> 33:50.762
So, come on then, mate.
What about you?

33:51.829 --> 33:53.498
You must remember somethin'.

33:55.866 --> 33:57.535
We're tight, right?

33:57.568 --> 33:59.370
-Of course, we are, mate. Yeah.
-Yeah?

34:01.138 --> 34:03.441
'Cause what happened to me
was perfect, yeah?

34:03.474 --> 34:05.309
Absolutely perfect.

34:05.342 --> 34:08.612
And to be honest, the chance to
finally tell someone you respect

34:08.645 --> 34:10.547
makes it feel
all the more special.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.754
I saw her, Frenchie.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.425
[babbling]

34:21.859 --> 34:24.195
I saw Milly.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.097
She was smilin',
she was wavin' back at me.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.532
And that the thing here, y'know?

34:30.467 --> 34:32.402
She was happy.

34:32.436 --> 34:34.472
She wasn't disappointed
in her old man,

34:34.505 --> 34:37.208
as I thought she would be
all these years.

34:37.241 --> 34:40.110
She looked like a little angel,
staring back at me.

34:40.143 --> 34:42.413
[giggles]

34:42.446 --> 34:45.483
Ah. She made me
so happy, Frenchie,

34:45.516 --> 34:48.085
I could've just faded away
right there [snaps fingers].

34:49.652 --> 34:50.721
Yeah.

34:52.322 --> 34:53.391
That's beautiful, mate.

34:55.425 --> 34:58.162
Bloody hell. Here I am,
bangin' on about my tiny cock,

34:58.195 --> 34:59.830
and you've gone
and hit me with the, uh,

34:59.863 --> 35:01.432
one-two knockout
emotional punch.

35:01.465 --> 35:02.500
[laughing]

35:04.935 --> 35:06.637
[sighs]

35:06.670 --> 35:09.473
Y'know I'm not really
a religious man, Sue.

35:09.506 --> 35:11.409
I don't really believe
in any of that, but...

35:12.276 --> 35:13.478
whatever that was...

35:15.712 --> 35:17.848
I'm glad you got
to see her, mate.

35:17.881 --> 35:20.284
Yeah, me too, Frenchie. Me too.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.788
Ah, it's good stuff.

35:24.821 --> 35:26.357
Take it easy on that stuff, OK?

35:26.390 --> 35:28.392
We got an early rise
in the morning.

35:28.425 --> 35:31.529
Yeah, I'll be fine, mate.
Don't worry about me.

35:34.665 --> 35:35.799
[door opens]

35:35.832 --> 35:37.568
Oh, you were right, by the way.

35:40.204 --> 35:41.839
You know, the day we got shot?

35:43.874 --> 35:45.476
I should've listened to you.

35:47.911 --> 35:49.647
If I'd listened to you,
we'd both be better off

35:49.680 --> 35:51.282
than we are now,
that's for sure.

35:53.784 --> 35:55.453
Glad you're still alive, mate.

36:31.455 --> 36:34.592
OK, Frenchie. We're here.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.328
Looks like we're a little early,

36:37.361 --> 36:38.629
so let's kick back
a little bit, yeah?

36:38.662 --> 36:40.965
Wait till the owner gets here.

36:40.998 --> 36:43.767
Do me a favor,
wake me up when he does?

36:43.800 --> 36:46.003
I'm gonna take a little nap.

36:46.036 --> 36:48.872
Yeah, all right, mate.
You get your beauty sleep.

36:48.905 --> 36:51.375
I'm serious, Frenchie.
Just--just wake me up, yeah?

36:51.408 --> 36:53.711
I don't want it to be
too much of a stretch.

36:53.744 --> 36:57.248
Listen, mate, the only one
around here who needs to
do some stretchin' is you.

36:58.715 --> 37:00.251
You got a tone.

37:00.284 --> 37:01.752
[seat motor whirring]

37:01.785 --> 37:02.920
Have a nice nap.

37:13.430 --> 37:14.832
[sighs]

37:38.755 --> 37:39.790
[passing helicopter]

37:39.823 --> 37:41.692
Come on, oi. Come on, mate.

37:41.725 --> 37:43.694
Get up. I got you
a cup of coffee, yeah?

37:43.727 --> 37:45.563
-There we go. Wakey-wakey, mate.
-[groaning]

37:46.430 --> 37:47.498
All right?

37:48.832 --> 37:50.301
[Sue sighs]

37:54.504 --> 37:56.641
[loud yawning]

37:57.107 --> 37:59.009
[grunts]

37:59.042 --> 38:01.011
This is damn good coffee,
Frenchie.

38:01.044 --> 38:03.781
Jesus Christ, mate. Do you gimp
out like that every morning?

38:03.814 --> 38:05.716
Just startin' the engines, yeah?

38:05.749 --> 38:07.685
Sounded like you were rapin'
a rocking horse to me.

38:07.718 --> 38:08.952
Let's take a look
at the vig, shall we?

38:08.985 --> 38:10.821
[paper rustling]

38:14.624 --> 38:15.693
OK.

38:18.128 --> 38:22.099
All right.
Esteban Madrid, $95,000,

38:22.132 --> 38:24.968
City of Angles Boxing Club.
What--wa-wa-wa?

38:25.001 --> 38:26.337
[distant sirens]

38:26.370 --> 38:27.705
This a boxing club?

38:27.738 --> 38:29.340
I didn't realize
it was a boxing club.

38:29.373 --> 38:30.541
That's because
you don't concentrate

38:30.574 --> 38:31.608
when you read things, Frenchie.

38:31.641 --> 38:32.810
Yeah, that's right. You.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.678
I know this guy.

38:34.711 --> 38:36.714
He's been around, he's trained
a lot of good fighters.

38:36.747 --> 38:38.949
Let me tell you.
The number of these guys

38:38.982 --> 38:40.718
that can actually fight
is woefully fuckin' small.

38:40.751 --> 38:42.052
Yeah, same as pro MMA.

38:42.085 --> 38:43.821
Yeah, well,

38:43.854 --> 38:45.989
pro boxing, maybe it's
a little different. Yeah?

38:46.022 --> 38:48.559
Y'know, it's precise.
There's discipline.

38:48.592 --> 38:50.027
There's these. Yeah?

38:50.060 --> 38:51.729
Hang on a minute.
You're tryin' to tell me

38:51.762 --> 38:53.597
that martial arts doesn't
involve discipline?

38:53.630 --> 38:55.733
Because I think a lot of people
might disagree with that, mate.

38:55.766 --> 38:57.601
Just a few people.

38:57.634 --> 38:59.636
Well, that's not what
I'm sayin', Frenchie. OK?

38:59.669 --> 39:01.538
And I'm also not sayin' that
a boxer's gonna beat an MMA guy.

39:01.571 --> 39:03.107
What I am sayin' is,

39:03.140 --> 39:05.676
it's the sweet science.
It's fuckin' classy.

39:05.709 --> 39:09.012
Oh yeah, mate. Really classy,
yeah. Bitin' peoples' ears off.

39:09.045 --> 39:10.581
I mean, come on. It doesn't
get more corrupt--

39:10.614 --> 39:11.615
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
Frenchie. French.

39:11.648 --> 39:12.983
What?

39:13.016 --> 39:14.552
-Is it fuckin' open?
-[hinges creaking]

39:16.486 --> 39:17.955
Did he go inside?

39:17.988 --> 39:20.057
Ahh, you don't know. Right?

39:20.090 --> 39:22.092
[yelling] You were supposed to
be on fuckin' watch, Frenchie!

39:22.125 --> 39:24.628
Well, I'm sorry, mate, but I was
gettin' you a coffee, wasn't I?

39:24.661 --> 39:27.064
This here's the difference
between us leavin'
with the money

39:27.097 --> 39:29.700
and gettin' our fucking
asses kicked by a bunch
of prizefighters, yeah?

39:29.733 --> 39:31.702
All I'm sayin' is,
you're a little sloppy.

39:31.735 --> 39:33.971
Listen, mate, I'm not the one
kippin' on the job, am I?

39:34.004 --> 39:36.507
-That's you. Eh?
-Wouldn't be kippin'
If I didn't have to

39:36.540 --> 39:38.008
fuckin' drive this piece of shit
for fuckin' hours across--

39:38.041 --> 39:39.676
Yeah? Whatever!
Come on, let's get in there,

39:39.709 --> 39:41.011
before the rest turn up. Yeah?

39:49.953 --> 39:51.722
[French under his breath]
Fuckin' hell.

40:09.072 --> 40:10.607
The smell, Frenchie.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.010
Something you never forget.
The smell.

40:27.591 --> 40:28.992
Hey, hey-hey!

40:29.025 --> 40:32.029
Fellas, you can't just
walk in and hit the bag!

40:32.062 --> 40:34.598
Right? You gotta check in,
you gotta sign a waiver.

40:34.631 --> 40:36.667
-[Sue grunting]
- We ain't takin'
new members right now.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.736
All right? So, hey, gramps.
Gramps. Take it easy!

40:39.769 --> 40:42.105
All right? We don't
wanna have to break out
the defibrillator for you.

40:42.138 --> 40:44.475
[French]
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about him, mate.

40:44.508 --> 40:47.177
-He's tougher than he looks.
-Yeah, I ain't worried, pal.

40:47.210 --> 40:50.481
-I'm tellin' you two assholes,
get the fuck outta my gym.
-Ooh!

40:50.514 --> 40:52.716
Ah, there's no need
for language like that, pal.

40:52.749 --> 40:54.151
We're here to see
Mr. Madrid. OK?

40:54.184 --> 40:55.886
So, hop along
and get him, would ya?

40:58.188 --> 41:00.557
Fuck off.

41:00.590 --> 41:02.659
Listen, mate. If you're
gonna get saucy,

41:02.692 --> 41:04.495
fuckin' do somethin'. All right?

41:04.528 --> 41:06.163
'Cause I ain't got time
to piss about,

41:06.196 --> 41:07.698
comparing whose is bigger.

41:07.731 --> 41:10.734
If you knew me,
you'd know that mine is.

41:12.736 --> 41:14.738
[chuckles]

41:14.771 --> 41:16.740
Oh, right. OK.
You're a tough guy, are ya?

41:16.773 --> 41:17.741
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

41:17.774 --> 41:19.977
-Little bit.
-OK.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.579
Well, y'know this confidence
that you're showin' me right
now?

41:22.612 --> 41:24.114
It's fuckin' blind, mate.

41:24.147 --> 41:26.917
'Cause you don't
know me from Adam.

41:26.950 --> 41:29.286
But what you need to know
is that I'm the bloke

41:29.319 --> 41:31.221
who's just walked
into a boxing club

41:31.254 --> 41:34.024
and stepped up
to the brashest gobshite

41:34.057 --> 41:35.559
who ever wanted
a crack at the title,

41:35.592 --> 41:37.294
and I'm callin' him a cunt.

41:37.327 --> 41:40.664
And I'm doin' it in front
of all of his boyfriends, too.

41:40.697 --> 41:42.533
Yeah?

41:42.566 --> 41:45.202
So, either that makes me
the biggest dog in the yard...

41:45.235 --> 41:47.905
[whispering]
or a complete, fuckin' nutcase.

41:47.938 --> 41:50.107
Either way, mate, do as I said.

41:50.140 --> 41:52.276
Hop along, get your boss, yeah?

41:54.578 --> 41:55.779
OK.

41:55.812 --> 41:57.548
I will get Mr. Madrid.

41:57.581 --> 41:59.650
-Yeah, you do that.
-Yeah. He'll sort this shit out.

42:04.955 --> 42:07.624
Wow. You know, for someone
who doesn't like his job,

42:07.657 --> 42:09.026
you really know how to

42:09.059 --> 42:10.961
throw yourself into it,
Frenchie. Nice.

42:10.994 --> 42:13.063
Just tryin' to get this done
and put this shite behind us.

42:13.096 --> 42:14.264
Besides,

42:14.297 --> 42:16.233
they're only boxers, right?

42:23.039 --> 42:25.208
[music playing over radio]

42:25.241 --> 42:27.077
Vaughan, tell Sugar
to come join us.

42:28.144 --> 42:30.180
Tommy said you'd be stopping by.

42:30.213 --> 42:32.783
Good. Then we won't have to
go 'round and 'round.

42:32.816 --> 42:35.085
Ninety-five large.
Let's have it.

42:35.118 --> 42:36.954
That money was
a sponsorship deal,

42:36.987 --> 42:38.755
backin' one of my boys.

42:38.788 --> 42:42.225
Wasn't a loan,
so, it's not a debt.

42:42.258 --> 42:44.695
I don't borrow money
I can't pay back.

42:44.728 --> 42:46.296
So, it's now our money.

42:46.329 --> 42:48.232
So, you can tell Tommy
where he can stick it.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.235
Always seems to get complicated,
doesn't it, Sue?

42:52.268 --> 42:53.937
Yeah, well, we
wouldn't have a job

42:53.970 --> 42:55.038
if it didn't, Frenchie.

42:55.071 --> 42:56.707
OK, so look.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.775
I've been doing this
a very long time, yeah?

42:58.808 --> 43:00.877
-So--
-I know.

43:00.910 --> 43:03.614
You bested one of my prospects,
back in the day.

43:03.647 --> 43:05.115
You ruined his title shot.

43:05.148 --> 43:06.783
[French]
Oh, you know who he is then.

43:06.816 --> 43:08.251
And you should also know
that he's heard

43:08.284 --> 43:10.187
every goddamn excuse
in the book.

43:10.220 --> 43:12.089
So, listen, mate. We're in
nice and early, aren't we?

43:12.122 --> 43:14.024
Do me a favor,
give us the money and...

43:14.057 --> 43:15.692
we'll leave you be.

43:15.725 --> 43:17.094
-Oh? That's all you want?
-That's right.

43:17.127 --> 43:18.762
-Hm?
-Yeah.

43:18.795 --> 43:20.397
You know, if you're
serious about boxing,

43:20.430 --> 43:23.166
you should never fight
outside your weight division.

43:23.199 --> 43:26.003
[calling]
Sugar! Get in here!

43:30.940 --> 43:33.710
These two are here to reclaim
your sponsorship cash.

43:33.743 --> 43:35.212
Without it, you'll be broke.

43:35.245 --> 43:39.216
No sparring partners,
no camp, no expenses.

43:39.249 --> 43:41.184
We'll see about that.

43:41.217 --> 43:44.888
Which one of you pussies
is gettin' your gloves on?

43:44.921 --> 43:47.391
-I think that'll be you, mate.
-Yeah.

43:47.424 --> 43:50.127
Too much of a sweet science
for me anyway, right?

43:50.160 --> 43:52.162
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

43:53.229 --> 43:54.665
I guess it's you.

43:56.900 --> 43:58.902
[Sue chuckles]

43:58.935 --> 44:00.971
Let me tell you somethin'.
After I win,

44:01.004 --> 44:03.073
I'm gonna take that
fuckin' money. Trust me.

44:03.106 --> 44:04.307
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

44:04.340 --> 44:05.709
You ain't gonna win.

44:06.810 --> 44:08.212
Pick up the gloves, old man.

44:10.346 --> 44:11.848
I got this, French.

44:11.881 --> 44:13.684
[joints cracking]
[groaning]

44:17.320 --> 44:18.689
Let's go, man.

44:31.434 --> 44:33.970
C'mon, mate, doesn't go against
your new, uh, pacifist code?

44:34.003 --> 44:35.439
[grunting]

44:35.472 --> 44:37.307
This isn't unnecessary
violence, Frenchie.

44:37.340 --> 44:38.909
It's a sport,
in its purest form.

44:38.942 --> 44:40.811
Two athletes in their prime.

44:40.844 --> 44:44.715
Yeah, but you ain't either,
let's be honest.

44:44.748 --> 44:46.450
-[man] And, here we go!
-Go on, Golden Boy! Let's go!

44:46.483 --> 44:47.818
[men shouting]

44:47.851 --> 44:48.919
Come on, mate!

44:50.286 --> 44:51.789
Find the distance. C'mon!

44:53.356 --> 44:56.126
Whoa-whoa!
It's OK! it's all right.

44:57.193 --> 44:59.096
C'mon, Sue! We can do this!

45:01.197 --> 45:04.001
Stake you move, mate. Come on!

45:08.004 --> 45:10.807
Yes!

45:10.840 --> 45:14.044
Golden Boy's up in the house!
Come on, mate!

45:14.077 --> 45:15.179
You can do this!

45:16.846 --> 45:18.916
C'mon, mate, take your time!
Don't lose him!

45:21.117 --> 45:22.419
Why you waitin' there? Come on!

45:26.523 --> 45:29.359
What you waitin' there, Sue!
Find a way in, mate!

45:29.392 --> 45:30.928
Go on, mate!

45:34.564 --> 45:36.800
Ohh! Oh shit.

45:36.833 --> 45:39.436
-[grunting in pain]
-You all right?

45:39.469 --> 45:40.971
-You good?
-Ugh!

45:41.004 --> 45:43.340
C'mon, mate! Look at me.

45:43.373 --> 45:44.808
-[groaning]
-C'mon, mate. Up you get.

45:44.841 --> 45:46.409
Frenchie, I think
he moved a bullet.

45:46.442 --> 45:49.379
Just fucking go for it!

45:49.412 --> 45:52.249
Oi, you filthy twat!

45:52.282 --> 45:53.917
-[men shouting]
-The fuck was that?

45:53.950 --> 45:56.119
-Fucker's a twat!
-Fuck you, piece of shit!

45:56.152 --> 45:57.954
Sue. C'mon, mate, get up.

45:57.987 --> 45:59.923
Come on, you can
do it. Let's go.

45:59.956 --> 46:02.359
Frenchie, I've got three fuckin'
Adam's apples. I'm done.

46:02.392 --> 46:04.194
If you don't do this, we're
never gonna get that money.

46:04.227 --> 46:06.363
C'mon, mate, you can do it!
Golden Boy, Let's go!

46:06.396 --> 46:08.265
-[spits]
-[men laugh]

46:08.298 --> 46:09.833
You gonna sub in for ya boy?

46:09.866 --> 46:11.535
I'm tired of watching
him breathe!

46:11.568 --> 46:13.069
Frenchie! Listen to me.

46:13.102 --> 46:14.271
No matter what,
we're leavin' here

46:14.304 --> 46:15.272
with the fuckin' money.

46:15.305 --> 46:16.840
Go! Go do your thing.

46:16.873 --> 46:18.842
[angry sigh]

46:18.875 --> 46:21.044
-Same terms?
-Same terms, English.

46:21.077 --> 46:22.279
-Fuckin' on then.
-Come on, then.

46:22.312 --> 46:23.547
Come on, Frenchie!

46:25.248 --> 46:27.984
OK. Here's my little pep talk.

46:28.017 --> 46:30.387
You're aware of the Marquess
of Queensbury Rules, right?

46:30.420 --> 46:32.589
-Yeah.
-Yeah, well, fuck 'em!

46:32.622 --> 46:34.057
Go do your thing.

46:34.090 --> 46:35.392
He's on your six.

46:38.027 --> 46:39.062
[grunts]

46:41.030 --> 46:42.566
[men shouting]

46:58.882 --> 46:59.917
C'mon, Frenchie!

47:07.457 --> 47:08.525
Come on.

47:15.632 --> 47:18.001
You're good. Go after him!

47:28.511 --> 47:31.381
-[men] Oh!
-What the fuck, man?

47:31.414 --> 47:33.650
-[men] Dirty!
-What the fuck
is this guy doin'?

47:33.683 --> 47:35.018
Force of habit, mate.

47:36.019 --> 47:37.221
So, sorry.

47:39.122 --> 47:40.523
There you go!

47:40.556 --> 47:42.259
Just keep those fucking
gums chewing then.

47:42.292 --> 47:43.894
[men taunting]
Come on.

47:43.927 --> 47:45.495
[indistinct shouts]

47:45.528 --> 47:47.564
[grunting]

47:49.065 --> 47:50.400
[man]
There you go!

48:02.578 --> 48:04.314
-[crack]
-Aah!

48:06.716 --> 48:08.619
[screaming in pain]

48:09.385 --> 48:10.454
Jesus.

48:12.488 --> 48:13.590
-[gun cocking]
-Get the fuck out!

48:15.058 --> 48:17.227
Shut the fuck up!
Get the fuck out!

48:19.963 --> 48:21.531
Stay down, motherfucker!

48:23.299 --> 48:25.335
Stop! I'll blow
your fuckin' heads off!

48:25.368 --> 48:27.404
-Get the fuck off of me!
-Get in the corner!

48:27.437 --> 48:28.672
You stay in the corner!

48:30.006 --> 48:31.408
[breathing heavily]

48:32.542 --> 48:34.377
Stay right there.

48:34.410 --> 48:36.680
-Gimme the gun, Sue!
-Here ya go. Take that.

48:36.713 --> 48:38.448
Get up, motherfucker.
We're goin' to get that money!

48:38.481 --> 48:40.583
-[Estaban] Fuck you!
-Get in there!

48:40.616 --> 48:42.019
Get over there!

48:43.519 --> 48:44.588
Come on, Sue!

48:50.360 --> 48:51.461
What is this?

48:51.494 --> 48:53.163
There's two too many.

48:53.196 --> 48:55.298
We're not a robbery,
we're here on business.

48:55.331 --> 48:57.367
Yeah? That's sponsorship money.

48:57.400 --> 48:59.536
Gifted to us by fucking Barbosa.

48:59.569 --> 49:01.638
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, what'd you say?

49:01.671 --> 49:03.473
You said Barbosa?

49:03.506 --> 49:06.509
You fuckin' heard me.
Fuckin' sucker punched me.

49:06.542 --> 49:09.145
Yeah, I've got a bad habit
of doin' that. I'm sorry.

49:09.178 --> 49:11.681
Stay here, yeah?
Don't you fuckin' move.

49:11.714 --> 49:13.383
Don't you fuckin' move!

49:15.351 --> 49:17.253
Gimme the bag, Frenchie!

49:17.286 --> 49:19.056
And the gun! Come on.

49:23.526 --> 49:25.028
[engine starts]

49:25.061 --> 49:26.430
Let's get the fuck
outta here, yeah?

49:28.664 --> 49:29.699
OK, let's go!

49:29.732 --> 49:31.134
[men shouting]

49:31.167 --> 49:33.103
-[tires squeal]
-Get his ass!

49:38.341 --> 49:40.310
[Sue]
Actually, the kid was a ringer.

49:40.343 --> 49:42.012
Let me tell ya.
He was very good.

49:42.045 --> 49:43.413
The kid could've been
a good champion,

49:43.446 --> 49:45.181
until you went
and splintered his forearm

49:45.214 --> 49:46.516
like you did. Y'know?

49:46.549 --> 49:48.485
It was very cold,
Frenchie. Very cold.

49:48.518 --> 49:51.054
Yeah, well, I told you boxing's
no match for MMA, didn't I?

49:51.087 --> 49:53.089
A lot of people would
consider that cheating.

49:53.122 --> 49:56.659
I'll tell you somethin' else,
Frenchie. You've changed.

49:56.692 --> 49:58.261
And you've got a tone.

50:00.596 --> 50:02.432
So, where are we
off to next, anyway?

50:02.465 --> 50:04.534
Mm, OK.

50:04.567 --> 50:06.269
Let's have a look at this.

50:06.302 --> 50:07.771
[sniffs] OK.

50:10.073 --> 50:11.108
Give it to me.

50:13.076 --> 50:16.079
Canoga park. Deep in the Valley.

50:16.112 --> 50:17.414
Joyous.

50:17.447 --> 50:21.584
Cyrus Skinner, $255,000.
Jesus Christ.

50:21.617 --> 50:23.653
-Saved the heftiest
for last then?
-[car door opens]

50:23.686 --> 50:25.522
That's right, Frenchie.
That was the plan, brother.

50:25.555 --> 50:27.390
-Heads up.
-OK.

50:27.423 --> 50:28.558
What are these two doin' here?

50:28.591 --> 50:30.393
Don't worry about it, Frenchie.

50:30.426 --> 50:31.461
Play it cool. OK?

50:41.137 --> 50:44.107
Damn, you boys
are right on course.

50:44.140 --> 50:46.476
Two down and one to go, huh?

50:49.479 --> 50:53.383
You OK, though?
'Cause you boys look fucked up!

50:53.416 --> 50:54.785
[laughing]

50:56.452 --> 51:00.323
-Ask him, man.
-A'ight. Down-and-out.

51:00.356 --> 51:02.292
Ol' 'E' here reckons he saw you

51:02.325 --> 51:05.295
in some, uh,
cheap-ass kung-fu film.

51:05.328 --> 51:09.232
-Ninja. You're the
fucking Ninja.
-Jesus Christ.

51:09.265 --> 51:12.702
The movie Ninja. The kung-fu
movie Ninja. That's you, right?

51:12.735 --> 51:15.371
Actually, you would be correct,
gentlemen. That is me, yes.

51:15.404 --> 51:18.641
-Told you so, man. I told you!
-You liked that movie, yeah?

51:18.674 --> 51:20.510
Me and my brothers used to watch
that movie all the time

51:20.543 --> 51:22.745
when we were kids, man.

51:22.778 --> 51:24.747
Used to watch that shit
over and over again.

51:24.780 --> 51:27.417
-Wow.
-But I ain't fucking
with you today, man.

51:27.450 --> 51:30.286
Despite that bein' the best
ninja movie I've ever seen.

51:30.319 --> 51:32.122
Hang on a minute.
Are you tellin' me

51:32.155 --> 51:33.456
you've actually seen his movie?

51:33.489 --> 51:34.891
[laughing]
And that it was good?

51:34.924 --> 51:37.494
Bro! This fucker
used to be the shit, man.

51:37.527 --> 51:38.561
Yeah?

51:38.594 --> 51:40.163
You had that somethin' special.

51:41.831 --> 51:44.167
And what the fuck
happened to you?

51:44.200 --> 51:47.170
Same thing that's gonna happen
to you two boys.

51:47.203 --> 51:49.840
It's called life.
Yeah? It's called life.

51:50.773 --> 51:52.375
Well, maybe you can use

51:52.408 --> 51:55.145
some of your ninja skills
for your next job.

51:55.178 --> 51:57.247
-Cyrus Skinner.
-Let me as you a question--

51:57.280 --> 51:58.581
Don't worry about it, Frenchie.
It's OK.

51:58.614 --> 52:00.283
No, I wanna ask
a question, a'right?

52:00.316 --> 52:02.685
If you two are so on the ball,
right, so gangster,

52:02.718 --> 52:04.521
how come we're
collectin' the debts?

52:04.554 --> 52:05.889
Why not do it yourselves. Eh?

52:05.922 --> 52:07.891
Well...

52:07.924 --> 52:10.927
'cause Molly wants
to see you bleed

52:10.960 --> 52:13.229
for every buck he's owed.

52:13.262 --> 52:14.330
[laughs]

52:14.363 --> 52:15.732
What you talkin' about, mate?

52:15.765 --> 52:17.200
-Don't worry.
-What you talkin' about?

52:17.233 --> 52:18.568
-No, I'm worried!
-It's OK.

52:18.601 --> 52:19.903
No, I'm worried
about it. Who's Molly?

52:19.936 --> 52:22.472
Oh, you'll find out.
[chuckles]

52:22.505 --> 52:24.874
Find out what, mate?
Oi, I asked you a question!

52:24.907 --> 52:26.709
C'mon, Frenchie.
What the fuck do they know?

52:26.742 --> 52:28.344
They're not talkin'
about anything.

52:28.377 --> 52:29.512
C'mon, finish up. We gotta go.

52:29.545 --> 52:31.347
Don't worry about it.

52:31.380 --> 52:33.316
I'm gonna make a quick
phone call. I'll be right back.

52:41.624 --> 52:43.727
[sniffs, exhales]

52:45.661 --> 52:47.197
[ringing]

52:48.798 --> 52:50.633
[beep]

52:50.666 --> 52:52.335
[Sue]
Tell me you didn't know.

52:53.236 --> 52:54.837
Sulinski--

52:54.870 --> 52:57.240
Tell me it's as much a surprise
to you as it is to me

52:57.273 --> 52:59.910
that we're collecting Barbosa's
money for his brother Molly.

53:01.777 --> 53:04.948
We've had a good run,
Golden Boy.

53:04.981 --> 53:08.284
If I were you,
I'd take that money and run.

53:08.317 --> 53:09.586
-[gun cocks]
-Get the fuck outta he--

53:12.021 --> 53:13.256
[clears throat]

53:15.891 --> 53:19.762
Hey, hey. This is, uh,
Molly X, your new boss.

53:19.795 --> 53:23.700
Listen. You owe me
one more collection.

53:23.733 --> 53:26.369
So, bring that gold to Molly,

53:26.402 --> 53:28.672
and I might cream
off the vig for you.

53:30.606 --> 53:32.709
And your boy Tommy
can breathe easy again.

53:33.409 --> 53:34.477
[hangs up]

53:42.718 --> 53:43.787
[sniff]

54:26.095 --> 54:27.998
Sorry, Tommy. I tried.

54:33.836 --> 54:35.305
Let's go, Tommy.

54:35.338 --> 54:36.406
It's OK, Pete.

54:47.049 --> 54:49.652
You hate LA, but here you are.

54:49.685 --> 54:50.720
Sit down.

54:51.454 --> 54:53.556
[laughing]

54:53.589 --> 54:56.526
Ah, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

54:56.559 --> 54:58.594
I actually
love Los Angeles, man.

54:58.627 --> 55:01.831
I get my... Stacy Adams shined

55:01.864 --> 55:04.067
and shaved by brothers
on Slauson.

55:04.100 --> 55:05.835
I get my suits tailor made

55:05.868 --> 55:08.805
at Market and Manchester
in Inglewood.

55:08.838 --> 55:10.973
I got love
for the West Coast, man.

55:11.006 --> 55:12.075
Cutty.

55:14.577 --> 55:15.612
Good lookin'.

55:17.713 --> 55:19.449
But what I do hate...

55:21.584 --> 55:22.652
is liars.

55:25.054 --> 55:29.759
Now, either somebody gave you
some fucked up information,

55:29.792 --> 55:32.528
or you straight lied to me, man.

55:32.561 --> 55:36.532
The nature of my business
depends on information.

55:36.565 --> 55:39.535
That said, I'm not
the Encyclopedia Britannica.

55:39.568 --> 55:41.037
I get mine from the streets,

55:41.070 --> 55:43.039
so why don't you tell me
why you're here, Molly?

55:43.072 --> 55:44.941
I'll tell you why I'm here.

55:44.974 --> 55:47.610
French and Sue.

55:47.643 --> 55:49.479
You assured me they were wasted

55:49.512 --> 55:51.948
in the same shootout
that cost me my blood.

55:51.981 --> 55:53.883
A killin' that you
swore to my face

55:53.916 --> 55:56.452
that you had no hand in.

55:56.485 --> 55:58.888
Your brother Barbosa
was a client.

55:58.921 --> 56:01.524
It's bad business
to kill clients.

56:01.557 --> 56:03.559
So, your boys capped him
in self-defense,

56:03.592 --> 56:05.161
before the rest
of my brother's crew

56:05.194 --> 56:07.029
cut them all down
in a blaze of glory.

56:07.062 --> 56:09.432
-That's what you said, man.
-That's what I said.

56:09.465 --> 56:12.635
So, if that's
the straight-up truth...

56:12.668 --> 56:14.937
Why do I have
emissaries out here,

56:14.970 --> 56:16.773
from Inglewood to Hollywood,

56:16.806 --> 56:19.075
sayin' that French and Sue
was walkin' and talkin'

56:19.108 --> 56:22.078
and having a fine-ass time
here in the streets of So Cal?

56:23.946 --> 56:25.114
They're mistaken.

56:25.147 --> 56:26.182
[whirring]

56:26.215 --> 56:27.550
-[zaps]
-[groaning]

56:28.484 --> 56:30.153
[laughing]

56:30.186 --> 56:31.687
You're cold-blooded, Felix.

56:31.720 --> 56:33.857
That's not a wise choice
of words, Tommy.

56:36.959 --> 56:39.562
Let me have
a little peek up in there.

56:39.595 --> 56:41.831
[Tommy laughing]
What can I say, Molly?

56:41.864 --> 56:44.467
Y-you seem to be
three steps ahead of me.

56:44.500 --> 56:46.903
You lied to my fuckin' face.

56:46.936 --> 56:50.139
You disrespected
my brother's memory.

56:50.172 --> 56:55.511
So, for your part in all this,
you gots to pay in blood equity.

56:55.544 --> 56:57.881
[snaps fingers]
Cutty, let's be out.

57:01.217 --> 57:02.452
[sniffs]

57:03.152 --> 57:04.620
You see,

57:04.653 --> 57:06.088
my brother had
three sizable debts

57:06.121 --> 57:08.558
that needed collectin'
before he was killed.

57:08.591 --> 57:10.893
Tabs I can't be associated with.

57:10.926 --> 57:13.463
So, you're gonna have
your two goodfellas,

57:13.496 --> 57:16.799
French and Sue, close out
Barbosa's accounts for me.

57:16.832 --> 57:18.634
They don't work for me anymore.

57:18.667 --> 57:21.070
You're gonna make sure they do.
Because if you don't,

57:21.103 --> 57:23.039
I'm gonna be takin'
that fuckin' handsome head

57:23.072 --> 57:24.674
across the Bay Bridge with me.

57:28.177 --> 57:29.712
You got 48 hours.

57:29.745 --> 57:30.814
[sighs]

57:44.159 --> 57:46.996
So, you gonna tell me
who this Molly is then?

57:47.029 --> 57:49.198
I don't know, Frenchie.
I don't know.

57:49.231 --> 57:50.600
One collection left.

57:50.633 --> 57:51.667
Let's just get it done

57:51.700 --> 57:52.836
and get the money to Tommy.

57:54.136 --> 57:55.605
[French]
This is it, here, isn't it?

57:55.638 --> 57:57.006
Let's take a look at the vig.

57:57.940 --> 57:59.775
This is it, 7044, mate.

57:59.808 --> 58:01.244
-Harley fucking Davidson, right?
-Is that it, Frenchie?

58:03.913 --> 58:05.982
Oh, Christ.

58:06.015 --> 58:07.750
I tell you,
I fuckin' hate this job.

58:07.783 --> 58:09.185
Yeah, but you're good at it.

58:09.218 --> 58:11.054
[motorcycles rumble]

58:19.995 --> 58:22.164
That's our cue, Frenchie.
Perfect timing.

58:22.197 --> 58:23.766
Y'know what?

58:23.799 --> 58:26.035
Park the car
over there by the alleyway.

58:45.621 --> 58:47.757
Let's get this done as quickly
as possible, yeah?

58:51.327 --> 58:54.330
Whoa, whoa-whoa, wait a minute.
What are you thinkin'?

58:54.363 --> 58:57.033
Look. I'm sick of gettin'
in these punch-ups with
these people, right?

58:57.066 --> 58:58.668
Let's just get it
done quick, yeah?

58:58.701 --> 59:00.069
You make me nervous, Frenchie.

59:06.976 --> 59:09.812
[grinder whirring]

59:25.628 --> 59:27.997
[French]
Oi! Switch it off!

59:32.001 --> 59:34.037
-You guys need somethin'?
-Cyrus Skinner.

59:35.738 --> 59:38.007
-He expecting you?
-I couldn't give a fuck, mate.

59:38.040 --> 59:39.675
What'd you say?

59:39.708 --> 59:41.777
I said, we're lookin'
for Cyrus Skinner,

59:41.810 --> 59:43.913
so be a good boy,
run along and find him,

59:43.946 --> 59:45.948
before I kick
the fuckin' shit out of you.

59:45.981 --> 59:47.116
[Cyrus]
It's OK!

59:48.350 --> 59:50.152
It's all right, Knuckle.

59:50.185 --> 59:52.888
Take a break
from grindin' that bead.

59:52.921 --> 59:55.091
These lads are here
to see me.

59:55.124 --> 59:57.026
-Come on.
-Fuck off.

59:58.427 --> 01:00:01.297
Yeah, Tommy called me
and told me that

01:00:02.698 --> 01:00:05.401
you two might swing by.

01:00:05.434 --> 01:00:07.336
Spoke to Tommy, that's good.

01:00:07.369 --> 01:00:09.872
So, you've rustled up
the cash for us, then?

01:00:09.905 --> 01:00:12.174
[laughing] Uh-uh.

01:00:12.207 --> 01:00:14.744
That ain't never gonna happen.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:19.649
I am not paying Tommy
one fucking, red cent.

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:22.852
The loan done died
with the lender. Capisce?

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:24.320
C'mon. You can understand that.

01:00:24.353 --> 01:00:26.355
It's OK, Frenchie.
It's OK. I got it.

01:00:26.388 --> 01:00:27.890
Come on, Cyrus.
What's wrong with you?

01:00:27.923 --> 01:00:29.392
Be nice. You know
how it works, right?

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:32.028
Loan was transferred
and was reactivated, OK?

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:33.829
You owe money.
You don't get to keep the money.

01:00:33.862 --> 01:00:36.799
Yeah, well, y'know,
I was really, really hoping

01:00:36.832 --> 01:00:39.769
that you two would not
try to underestimate me.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:40.970
[French]
Well, listen to me, asshole.

01:00:41.003 --> 01:00:42.405
You've already spoke to Tommy,

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:44.173
then we don't have to
tell you who we are

01:00:44.206 --> 01:00:45.775
and what we get paid to do.

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.176
No. I know.

01:00:47.209 --> 01:00:49.845
You fucking, English cunt!

01:00:49.878 --> 01:00:52.748
[loudly] Do you really think
you can intimidate me?

01:00:52.781 --> 01:00:55.284
You too, you little,
fuckin' cocksucker!

01:00:55.317 --> 01:00:56.886
I was dealing
with assholes like you,

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:58.054
while you were still
in fuckin' nappies!

01:00:58.087 --> 01:00:59.722
That's it! Fucking had enough.

01:00:59.755 --> 01:01:00.856
You're gonna go up there,
and you're gonna

01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:01.957
get the money right now!

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:03.159
Frenchie! What are you doin'?

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.160
-Put the--
-No, Sue! Shut up!

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.161
[gun cocks]

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:06.328
[calmly] What?

01:01:06.361 --> 01:01:08.464
You think this scares me?

01:01:08.497 --> 01:01:10.132
-Oi! Get back!
-Frenchie, don't shoot.

01:01:10.165 --> 01:01:12.435
No, shut up, Sue!
No! Fucking sick of this.

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.870
You get up there, right now.
You get the money.

01:01:14.903 --> 01:01:16.872
Fuck you! why don't you pull
the fuckin' trigger?

01:01:16.905 --> 01:01:18.441
Get your money! Do it!

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:19.942
Stop!

01:01:19.975 --> 01:01:21.010
[thud]

01:01:26.782 --> 01:01:29.485
[crushing]

01:01:29.518 --> 01:01:31.220
[gasping, gurgling]

01:01:31.253 --> 01:01:32.722
Stay right fuckin' there!

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:34.390
[coughing]

01:01:38.527 --> 01:01:39.862
OK.

01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:42.131
OK, Cyrus, so...

01:01:43.198 --> 01:01:44.967
listen to me.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.869
You can tell me
to go fuck myself, right?

01:01:46.902 --> 01:01:48.070
-[groaning]
-But be smart,

01:01:48.103 --> 01:01:49.405
'cause right about now,

01:01:49.438 --> 01:01:51.107
your bones are all
startin' to break.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.409
Floatin' in little pieces
around your orbital.

01:01:53.442 --> 01:01:55.411
Soon you're gonna
lose sight in one eye.

01:01:55.444 --> 01:01:57.413
Maybe lose a little
cognitive reasoning.

01:01:57.446 --> 01:01:59.448
But that doesn't matter,
Cyrus. Wanna know why?

01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:01.016
Because I'm gonna
keep hittin' you.

01:02:01.049 --> 01:02:03.018
[mumbled protest]

01:02:03.051 --> 01:02:04.820
And you know what, Cyrus?

01:02:04.853 --> 01:02:06.122
One day, really soon,
you're gonna

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:07.990
be able to eat dinner
through a straw.

01:02:08.023 --> 01:02:10.192
With one good eye. So, just
tell us where the money is, hey?

01:02:10.225 --> 01:02:12.061
Come on. There you go.

01:02:13.962 --> 01:02:15.498
[with difficulty]
Knuckle. Go.

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:19.034
Go to my office and...
and get the bag.

01:02:19.067 --> 01:02:20.470
[coughs blood]
Go.

01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:24.807
Hey, Knuckle!

01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:28.344
Don't do anything stupid,
all right?

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:30.813
[mumbles]

01:02:33.982 --> 01:02:35.985
Good job with the, uh,
non-violence thing, by the way.

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:37.887
Doin' a real good job there,
mate. Impressive.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.388
Are you kiddin' me, Frenchie?
I had to do somethin'.

01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:41.224
You were gonna put
a bullet in the old man.

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:44.894
I wasn't actually
gonna shoot him, was I?

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:47.062
What, you think I'm a fucking
psychopathic murderer?

01:02:47.095 --> 01:02:48.430
I was just tryin'
to shit him up.

01:02:48.463 --> 01:02:50.399
-[glass breaking]
-[metallic thud]

01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:53.536
[panting]

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:54.904
[French]
Fucking running!

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.138
Go after him!

01:02:56.171 --> 01:02:57.206
Give me the gun
and go after him!

01:02:57.239 --> 01:02:59.408
Give me the gun! Go after him!

01:03:04.613 --> 01:03:06.182
[panting]

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.568
[tires screech]

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:26.836
[car horn honks]

01:03:41.149 --> 01:03:42.285
[French]
Hey, come here!

01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:50.359
Ugh!

01:03:54.496 --> 01:03:56.465
[grunting]

01:03:56.498 --> 01:03:57.934
[under his breath]
Fuckin' hell.

01:04:32.968 --> 01:04:34.470
Jesus Christ!

01:04:36.605 --> 01:04:38.241
[vehicle approaches]

01:04:51.019 --> 01:04:52.555
[both grunting]

01:04:59.294 --> 01:05:01.297
Gimme that fuckin' bag. Now!

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:05.401
-Ugh! [panting]
-Jesus Christ.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.102
What was that? Acrobatics?

01:05:07.135 --> 01:05:08.304
-[groaning]
-You in the circus?

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:10.339
It's parkour, bro.

01:05:10.372 --> 01:05:11.507
I wanna be a stuntman.

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.142
You should see me on a bike.

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:16.078
Stuntman?

01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:19.248
Nah-nah, mate.
Nah, that's a terrible idea.

01:05:19.281 --> 01:05:20.549
That's dangerous!

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:24.586
You're lucky I didn't
kick the shit out of ya.

01:05:24.619 --> 01:05:26.022
[Knuckle]
You just did.

01:05:27.456 --> 01:05:28.457
[groaning]

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:30.126
[coughing]

01:05:33.428 --> 01:05:34.497
We good, Frenchie?

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:38.133
Yeah, looks like we're good.

01:05:38.166 --> 01:05:41.003
Good. Let's pack it up
and get outta here, yeah?

01:05:41.036 --> 01:05:42.738
Get it back to Tommy.
He can give it to Molly.

01:05:42.771 --> 01:05:45.374
And we can put the whole fucking
universe back into balance.

01:05:45.407 --> 01:05:46.475
[hoarsely]
Molly?

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.045
You're talkin' about Barbosa's

01:05:50.078 --> 01:05:52.281
psychotic,
fucking brother Molly?

01:05:52.314 --> 01:05:54.650
-What'd you just say?
-[coughs]

01:05:54.683 --> 01:05:57.720
If Molly's taken over
Barbosa's loans,

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:59.388
you two are so fucked.

01:05:59.421 --> 01:06:01.056
Sue, did you just hear
what he just said?

01:06:01.089 --> 01:06:02.424
We've been collecting
Barbosa's debts.

01:06:02.457 --> 01:06:04.226
I know, Frenchie. I know.

01:06:04.259 --> 01:06:05.995
-It's OK, it's OK, Frenchie.
-We're fucked!

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:08.297
-Tommy fucking set--
-We'll talk about it outside!

01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:10.232
Tell you everything
you wanna know. Outside.

01:06:12.067 --> 01:06:13.635
We'll be leaving you now, Cyrus.

01:06:13.668 --> 01:06:15.337
[hoarsely]
Yeah.

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:19.708
You're gonna know pain
soon, bro. [coughing]

01:06:19.741 --> 01:06:21.243
C'mon, gimme the keys.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.258
French, you OK?

01:06:37.559 --> 01:06:38.728
[sighs]

01:06:40.362 --> 01:06:43.465
Just tell me, please,
that you didn't know

01:06:43.498 --> 01:06:45.267
that these are Barbosa's debts

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.136
we've been collecting
for the past two days.

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:48.204
Just tell me that.

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.511
I wasn't positive,
Frenchie. Not at first.

01:06:57.212 --> 01:06:58.747
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:01.250
I dunno, Frenchie.
Tommy calls me outta the blue,

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.352
he tells me he's got
this gangster breathin'
down his fuckin' neck

01:07:03.385 --> 01:07:05.220
and he tells me
it's serious, yeah?

01:07:05.253 --> 01:07:07.623
Then he tells me he wants me to
collect three vigs in 48 hours.

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:10.459
He wants me to do it with you.
Yeah? Nobody else.

01:07:10.492 --> 01:07:13.395
Just you.
Specifically, just you!

01:07:13.428 --> 01:07:15.464
Then when that thug walked
into the burger joint

01:07:15.497 --> 01:07:17.199
and mentioned
Molly's name, well...

01:07:17.232 --> 01:07:18.534
what can I tell you, Frenchie?

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.202
I started to put it all
together myself.

01:07:20.235 --> 01:07:21.537
And you didn't think to
tell me this before?

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:23.105
C'mon, Frenchie,
you understand me.

01:07:23.138 --> 01:07:24.706
I was lookin' after Tommy, OK?

01:07:24.739 --> 01:07:26.642
Besides, the only thing
I do know is, if I told you,

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:28.477
you wouldn't have
helped me out. Right?

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:30.145
If you knew, you wouldn't
help me. Th-that I do know.

01:07:30.178 --> 01:07:32.147
-No, I wouldn't have done.
-That's right.

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.349
Do you know why? 'Cause I'm not
fucking stupid, that's why!

01:07:34.382 --> 01:07:35.751
-C'mon, I'm sorry, brother.
-Fuck off, mate!

01:07:35.784 --> 01:07:37.486
Frenchie, c'mon!

01:07:37.519 --> 01:07:39.688
Brother, you're--.
C'mon, think about it.

01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:41.490
Wait a minute.
We're three for three.

01:07:41.523 --> 01:07:43.358
We've a fuckin'
three-run home stretch.

01:07:43.391 --> 01:07:45.194
Home stretch to what, mate?

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:47.229
A den of fucking vipers?

01:07:47.262 --> 01:07:48.630
You're tellin' me
that you're gonna

01:07:48.663 --> 01:07:49.799
risk your life for this guy?

01:07:50.899 --> 01:07:52.434
Yeah. I am.

01:07:52.467 --> 01:07:54.269
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:07:54.302 --> 01:07:56.171
What the fuck's wrong with ya?

01:07:56.204 --> 01:07:58.273
'Cause he's gonna
fuckin' die, Frenchie. OK?

01:07:58.306 --> 01:08:00.209
And you don't know him
like I know him.

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:01.777
Just--

01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:03.813
Just calm down for a second,
Frenchie. Just listen.

01:08:05.847 --> 01:08:07.416
OK, look.

01:08:07.449 --> 01:08:08.851
When leukemia
took my little Milly,

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:11.286
I lost everything, yeah?
My wife.

01:08:11.319 --> 01:08:12.354
My life was goin'
down the toilet.

01:08:12.387 --> 01:08:13.622
It was fuckin' done!

01:08:13.655 --> 01:08:16.892
It was fuckin' done!
It was done.

01:08:16.925 --> 01:08:19.728
He was there for me yet again.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.430
You understand me? With you,
I spent a weekend with you.

01:08:22.464 --> 01:08:25.300
Yeah. We busted some heads
and I call you my brother.

01:08:25.332 --> 01:08:27.368
But you gotta understand
what me and Tommy are

01:08:27.402 --> 01:08:28.737
to understand how I really feel.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.139
You with me?

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:33.774
You gotta listen to me now. OK?

01:08:33.808 --> 01:08:35.377
Just listen to me.

01:08:36.678 --> 01:08:38.180
We should just do one.

01:08:38.212 --> 01:08:40.249
And get outta this shit
right now.

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:41.884
There's $250,000 in this bag,

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.719
there's another $250,000
in the trunk of that car.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:45.354
I say we split the collection
down the fuckin' middle

01:08:45.386 --> 01:08:47.221
and get out of here
while we still can.

01:08:47.255 --> 01:08:49.158
[quietly] Don't do it, Frenchie.
OK, c'mon. Don't do it.

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:51.493
Oh, fuck you, Sue! I'm doin' you
a favor here, mate. Right?

01:08:51.526 --> 01:08:54.229
And I've earned this money,
so I'm fuckin' keepin' it!

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:00.669
Let go of the bag, Sue.

01:09:00.702 --> 01:09:02.738
I can't let you
take the bag, Frenchie.

01:09:04.606 --> 01:09:06.675
Let go of the fucking bag, Sue.

01:09:11.712 --> 01:09:12.747
Make me.

01:09:18.953 --> 01:09:21.823
Ah, Jesus, Frenchie!
I'm sorry, OK? Look.

01:09:21.856 --> 01:09:24.926
Ring's off, I come in peace,
I didn't mean it, brother. OK?

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.495
Why did you fuckin' hit me?

01:09:26.528 --> 01:09:28.531
C'mon, Frenchie.
You fuckin' hit me--Uhh!

01:09:30.732 --> 01:09:35.737
OK. OK, that's it.
Just, just give me the bag.

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.506
-I'm not givin' you the bag.
-Well you got to gimme the bag.

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:40.809
-I'm not givin' you
the fuckin' bag, Sue!
-I'm taking that fuckin' bag.

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:43.912
[grunting]

01:09:45.412 --> 01:09:47.515
OK, just leave it.
Just fuckin' stop!

01:09:49.317 --> 01:09:52.220
Frenchie, please, just c'mon.
OK, c'mon please!

01:09:56.891 --> 01:09:57.960
[gasping]

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:03.799
I'm takin' that bag, Sue.

01:10:10.872 --> 01:10:12.942
[grunting]

01:10:24.586 --> 01:10:25.821
Fuck!

01:10:37.599 --> 01:10:39.268
Damn.

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:42.571
Now, what the fuck
are these idiots doin' now?

01:10:42.604 --> 01:10:44.439
Remember
that little conversation

01:10:44.472 --> 01:10:46.508
we had about MMA
versus boxing? Yeah?

01:10:46.541 --> 01:10:47.610
-[gasping]
-I win.

01:10:48.076 --> 01:10:49.411
Aah!

01:10:50.812 --> 01:10:51.847
[groans]

01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:56.752
OK. Yeah?

01:10:59.387 --> 01:11:00.722
Y'know, I was tryin' to give you

01:11:00.755 --> 01:11:02.057
an easy way out
with that choke, Sue.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:03.492
Know what I'm gonna
have to do now?

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:05.327
I'm gonna have to fuck you up.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.928
Hey, you know how many times
I've heard that, Frenchie?

01:11:06.961 --> 01:11:09.531
What are you gonna do?
Gonna kick me?

01:11:09.564 --> 01:11:10.599
Uhh!

01:11:15.403 --> 01:11:17.439
[grunting]

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:33.789

01:11:50.505 --> 01:11:53.041
OK. Come on.

01:11:53.074 --> 01:11:54.676
Come on then.

01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:56.111
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

01:11:56.144 --> 01:11:57.112
Come on then.

01:11:57.145 --> 01:11:58.480
Aah!

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:05.521
[groaning]

01:12:06.087 --> 01:12:07.323
[gasping]

01:12:08.656 --> 01:12:10.059
Jeez, Frenchie, OK.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.564
-[weak cough]
-Y'know I gotta be honest, Sue.

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:18.500
Always wondered who'd come out
on top, if it came down to it.

01:12:18.533 --> 01:12:20.669
Yeah? Y'know what?

01:12:20.702 --> 01:12:23.772
[groans, spits]

01:12:24.439 --> 01:12:25.474
Me too.

01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:30.412
[ears ringing]

01:12:32.847 --> 01:12:33.882
C'mon!

01:12:48.963 --> 01:12:50.632
That's for my coupe!

01:12:53.735 --> 01:12:54.770
C'mon.

01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:58.574
-Ah!
-C'mon!

01:13:03.945 --> 01:13:07.015
-[phone ringing]
-[distant fight sounds]

01:13:08.516 --> 01:13:09.885
Yeah, boss?

01:13:11.786 --> 01:13:14.489
Yeah, Tommy's boy
handled his business.

01:13:14.522 --> 01:13:17.793
Shi--They doin' that
to themselves right now.

01:13:18.993 --> 01:13:20.896
All right. We'll handle it.

-[beep]
-[grunts and blows]

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.150

[crunch]

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.958

01:13:54.095 --> 01:13:55.798
[continues groaning]

01:14:02.737 --> 01:14:04.940
Hey.

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:06.842
I just want you to know
somethin', Frenchie.

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.543
I want you to know,
there's no fuckin' way

01:14:08.576 --> 01:14:10.879
I can leave Tommy
to die like an animal.

01:14:10.912 --> 01:14:12.714
Hope you understand that, yeah?

01:14:13.581 --> 01:14:15.117
[breathing heavily]

01:14:15.917 --> 01:14:17.185
What's up?

01:14:17.218 --> 01:14:18.520
Yeah?

01:14:19.587 --> 01:14:20.989

Damn. You boys done fucked up!

01:14:45.146 --> 01:14:49.784
I had money on you, Ninja.
You owe me a slice now.

01:14:49.817 --> 01:14:52.921
Yeah, you're a couple of
tough guys you lot, aren't ya?

01:14:52.954 --> 01:14:55.524
But it was us that got your
boss' money back, wasn't it?

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.892
So, there you go!

01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:59.661
Go on, take it!

01:14:59.694 --> 01:15:02.130
-You can count on that,
motherfucker.

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:22.584
[keys jingle]

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.589
You go back there,

01:15:27.622 --> 01:15:29.825
you're a fucking dead man,
and you know it.

01:15:32.226 --> 01:15:34.029
The money's yours.

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:35.697
I'm takin' the truck.

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:37.799
Frenchie.

[sirens in distance]

01:17:32.013 --> 01:17:33.381
[Tommy]
Don't worry about me.

01:17:33.414 --> 01:17:35.750
Just worry
about the next two jobs.

01:17:35.783 --> 01:17:38.086
[sigh] I'm sorry,
I got you into this, Sue.

01:17:38.119 --> 01:17:39.788
[Sue]
That's OK, Tommy. You know?

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:40.855
We go way back, yeah?

01:17:40.888 --> 01:17:42.290
I owe you for things. Right?

01:17:42.323 --> 01:17:45.160
You know how that goes.

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:49.064
[Tommy]
We've had a good run,
Golden Boy.

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:51.900
If I were you, and I got
that money, I'd disappear.

01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:53.669
Run.

01:18:47.288 --> 01:18:48.456
[Marcus]
Hey, Molly.

01:18:48.489 --> 01:18:50.125
Look who's come to visit.

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:53.261
[Tommy] Fuck.
Why'd you come back?

01:18:53.294 --> 01:18:55.030
[Molly]
That's far enough, motherfucker.

01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:01.369
Cutty, pour me a shot
of that Rooster Rojo, will ya?

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:06.508
My man, Sue.

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:10.211
You got the J-U-ice.
I say that for you.

01:19:10.244 --> 01:19:12.981
Where's your road dog?
Mister Jiu-Jitsu.

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:15.183
Lost his appetite for the job.

01:19:15.216 --> 01:19:17.385
So, he left you
holdin' the bags, huh?

01:19:17.418 --> 01:19:18.987
Eh, guess so.

01:19:20.488 --> 01:19:22.390
[Tommy]
Don't you ever listen?

01:19:22.423 --> 01:19:25.860
What the fuck are you
doin' back here?

01:19:25.893 --> 01:19:27.562
[Molly]
See, your man Tommy,
he lied to me, man.

01:19:27.595 --> 01:19:29.063
He said that you were dead.

01:19:29.096 --> 01:19:30.498
I mean, you look
kinda fucked up but...

01:19:30.531 --> 01:19:32.934
y-you, you don't look dead
to me, man.

01:19:32.967 --> 01:19:35.036
Actually, in Tommy's defense,

01:19:35.069 --> 01:19:36.304
I did die.

01:19:37.038 --> 01:19:38.439
Twice.

01:19:38.472 --> 01:19:40.542
So, you've been breathin'
on borrowed air.

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:41.877
Right, homes?

01:19:42.476 --> 01:19:44.245
Yeah, maybe so.

01:19:44.278 --> 01:19:46.314
Y'know, Molly,

01:19:46.347 --> 01:19:48.249
I returned your brother's
bounty, right?

01:19:48.282 --> 01:19:50.285
So, about you take
the cream off the vig,

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:52.353
you let Tommy go,
and we'll be on our way?

01:19:52.386 --> 01:19:55.456
What do you say?
How's that sound, homes? Yeah?

01:19:55.489 --> 01:19:57.325
Go on, Tommy. You're OK. Get up.

01:19:57.358 --> 01:19:59.494
[louder] Tommy.
Get up, let's go!

01:19:59.527 --> 01:20:01.997
[Molly]
Cutty. Shoot Tommy
if he moves, man.

01:20:04.198 --> 01:20:06.167
Lemme ask you a question, Sue.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.436
Did you really think
that you would ever

01:20:08.469 --> 01:20:10.405
be walkin' outta here
a free man?

01:20:10.438 --> 01:20:12.374
Did you--did you
really think that?

01:20:14.141 --> 01:20:15.944
Felix, get my fuckin' dough!

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:18.613
Now, go ahead. Take your money.

01:20:18.646 --> 01:20:20.481
It's all your money, Molly.

01:20:20.514 --> 01:20:22.317
I don't give a fuck
about your money.

01:20:24.018 --> 01:20:26.521
Come on! Don't you fuckin' move.

01:20:26.554 --> 01:20:30.258
Or I will blow
her fuckin' head clean off!

01:20:30.291 --> 01:20:32.493
You listen to me, Molly.
I ain't playin' games here.

01:20:32.526 --> 01:20:35.196
You got your money,
you got what you fuckin' wanted.

01:20:35.229 --> 01:20:38.266
You let me and Tommy go.
Real simple. Yeah?

01:20:38.299 --> 01:20:39.934
[Molly laughs]

01:20:39.967 --> 01:20:42.237
Shoot the fine bitch.
You think I give a fuck?

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:45.340
Some gangster shit.
M.O.B. No offense, Felix.

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:49.077
[Felix]
If you guys have a clean
shot, shoot this motherfucker!

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:51.346
You see, you just put your money
on the wrong color, Sue.

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:54.349
Fuck you, I'll do it! Fuckin'
stay back you motherfuckers!

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:55.350
Felix.

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:56.618
Stay back! Stay back!

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:58.319
Or I'll fuckin' blood you!

01:20:58.352 --> 01:20:59.888
-Go ahead!
-[whirring]

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:01.022
-[zapping]
-[groaning]

01:21:01.055 --> 01:21:02.457
-[thud]
-[Molly laughing]

01:21:03.357 --> 01:21:04.593
[groaning]

01:21:10.698 --> 01:21:12.467
[gasping]

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.135
[ears ringing]

01:21:19.373 --> 01:21:21.509
[muffled, laughing] You really
are a gangster, aren't you?

01:21:31.552 --> 01:21:33.388
Big Bo, hold that
for me, would ya?

01:21:40.027 --> 01:21:42.530
Sue, that--
that must've hurt, man.

01:21:42.563 --> 01:21:44.632
Yeah, it did.

01:21:44.665 --> 01:21:47.435
Women, it's like
they always go for our nuts.

01:21:47.468 --> 01:21:48.536
I know.

01:21:52.006 --> 01:21:54.242
You do know what's gonna
happen next, all right?

01:21:55.609 --> 01:21:57.479
I got a pretty good idea, yeah.

01:21:58.679 --> 01:22:00.382
You may be a little scared.

01:22:04.485 --> 01:22:06.988
Yeah. Actually, I am.

01:22:07.021 --> 01:22:09.491
Aw, man. That's honesty.

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:12.127
I like that.

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:16.631
[Tommy laughing]
Hey, Molly.

01:22:18.265 --> 01:22:21.336
Barbosa set my boys up to die.

01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:23.138
I couldn't let that slide.

01:22:23.771 --> 01:22:25.640
So, yes,

01:22:25.673 --> 01:22:28.242
I shot that piece of shit
brother of yours.

01:22:28.275 --> 01:22:30.311
And I'd do it again.

01:22:30.344 --> 01:22:33.281
See, it wasn't just business.

01:22:33.314 --> 01:22:36.451
I did it because he was
an evil piece of shit!

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:38.987
You think I don't know
you set us up?

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.656
Not after all the years.
You'll walk the line before me.

01:22:45.192 --> 01:22:46.661
Finally, you tell me the truth.

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:50.198
But about murderin'
my brother...

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:53.067
Ah, come on, Molly.
It's me you want, not Sue!

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.635
Let him walk outta here.

01:22:54.668 --> 01:22:56.271
It's no shame on you!

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:02.276
I always knew that it was you.

01:23:02.309 --> 01:23:04.479
But now you're gonna suffer...

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:06.081
watchin' him suffer.

01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:09.451
Cutty, hold that.

01:23:12.086 --> 01:23:14.389
You see this black beauty
right here?

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:17.492
She was trained in
the School for the Americas.

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:20.261
Where the most devious
motherfuckers

01:23:20.294 --> 01:23:24.265
go to learn how to torture
and do fucked-up shit.

01:23:24.298 --> 01:23:25.734
She knows things.

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:29.670
I call her L.L.

01:23:29.703 --> 01:23:31.506
'Cause she loves to torture.

01:23:34.842 --> 01:23:36.244
Hey.

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:39.748
[exhales] OK. Wow.

01:23:41.715 --> 01:23:44.552
Listen. I know we have
this crazy connection.

01:23:44.585 --> 01:23:46.287
I see it, too. I do.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.057
I don't think now's
the time or the...

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:50.758
pla...

01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:54.362
time or the place.
Know what I mean?

01:23:54.395 --> 01:23:58.332
-Now you bite the wood, Sue.
-Y'know, Felix, I was thinkin'
maybe you could bite mine first.

01:23:58.365 --> 01:24:01.135
-[laughing]
-Unless you wanna bite
your own fuckin' tongue off,

01:24:01.168 --> 01:24:02.470
bite the wood, motherfucker!

01:24:02.503 --> 01:24:04.105
[gagging]

01:24:04.138 --> 01:24:06.107
See, this is called
the Tucker Telephone.

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.677
They used it on unruly prisoners
back in the Old South.

01:24:09.710 --> 01:24:12.380
A long-distance phone call.
That's how they phrased it.

01:24:12.413 --> 01:24:16.151
-[current whirring]
-Baby girl, light 'em up!

01:24:18.452 --> 01:24:19.788
[strangled cries]

01:24:27.828 --> 01:24:29.764
[current cuts out]

01:24:29.797 --> 01:24:31.299
Fuck!

01:24:35.636 --> 01:24:37.205
[Molly]
Bring him back.

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:39.174
Fuck you!

01:24:40.541 --> 01:24:43.378
[gleeful laughter]
Yeah, suffering.

01:24:48.415 --> 01:24:54.222
Three... two... one.

01:24:56.690 --> 01:24:58.326
[gasping]

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:01.429
[laughing]

01:25:01.462 --> 01:25:04.899
Don't fall asleep, Sue.
I'll use the adrenaline again,

01:25:04.932 --> 01:25:07.368
-and you don't wanna
have a heart attack.
-[mumbling]

01:25:07.401 --> 01:25:09.871
Baby girl, make
another long distance call.

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:12.240
You don't have to
do that either.

01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:16.377
[gagging and gasping]

01:25:17.778 --> 01:25:19.247
[Molly]
Light him up.

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:22.817
[cries]

01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:24.919
Everybody put your
fuckin' guns down, now!

01:25:24.952 --> 01:25:26.754
Get down on the floor now!

01:25:26.787 --> 01:25:28.422
[amused] Oh, shit.

01:25:28.455 --> 01:25:30.591
Fuckin' Jiu-Jitsu
I was tellin' you about.

01:25:30.624 --> 01:25:32.693
I think the odds are
against you, mate!

01:25:32.726 --> 01:25:34.795
I wouldn't be too sure
about that, mate.

01:25:34.828 --> 01:25:36.764
[Britt]
Drop your weapons!

01:25:36.797 --> 01:25:41.269
Don't wanna hurt anyone.
Just want the money.

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:45.473
Bitch in the purple.
Get over there.

01:25:45.506 --> 01:25:49.410
Anyone fuckin' moves,
stitch 'em to the wallpaper!

01:25:49.443 --> 01:25:53.881
A'right, you two in the back!
Untie them, both of 'em!

01:25:53.914 --> 01:25:57.185
[bellowing] Untie them now!
I'm not fuckin' about!

01:25:57.818 --> 01:25:59.420
I will shoot you.

01:25:59.453 --> 01:26:01.189
Think I give a fuck?
I've been shot before.

01:26:01.222 --> 01:26:03.558
Places and faces,
motherfucker. I'll find you.

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.226
Gonna turn around and a 6'5"

01:26:05.259 --> 01:26:07.328
lightskinned nigga's
gonna be right there.

01:26:07.361 --> 01:26:08.496
Bang-bang.

01:26:08.529 --> 01:26:10.865
Shut the fuck up and sit down.

01:26:10.898 --> 01:26:14.202
[hearty laughter]
Best shoot that bitch, man.

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:15.870
-[screaming]
-[Britt] Fuckin kill 'em all!

01:26:37.424 --> 01:26:39.393
[glass shatters]

01:26:39.426 --> 01:26:41.662
Get the fuck outta here,
Golden Boy!

01:26:41.695 --> 01:26:43.898
I'll fuckin' drag you
outta here if I have to.

01:26:54.975 --> 01:26:57.511
Get the fuck outta here! Go!

01:26:57.544 --> 01:26:59.780
Is that what you think?
I'm gonna drag you outta here

01:26:59.813 --> 01:27:01.949
if I fuckin' have to,
I didn't come all this way--

01:27:01.982 --> 01:27:03.751
Take the fuckin' money!

01:27:07.421 --> 01:27:11.593
No, no, no... No!

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:36.985
Back up! Get down there!

01:27:45.993 --> 01:27:47.929
Eat lead, bitch!

01:27:49.463 --> 01:27:50.798
[groaning and shouting]

01:28:02.109 --> 01:28:03.611
[man screaming]

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:06.981
[man]
Go, go, go!

01:28:08.582 --> 01:28:10.051
Bite this, bitch!

01:28:17.991 --> 01:28:20.361
[sporadic gunfire]

01:28:27.901 --> 01:28:30.538
[screaming and groaning]

01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:46.721
Eat this, motherfucker!

01:28:49.623 --> 01:28:52.426
Get up! let's move!

01:28:52.459 --> 01:28:54.395
Come on, Sue, let's go!

01:28:54.428 --> 01:28:55.630
Come on!

01:29:16.083 --> 01:29:17.485
You're gone now!

01:29:22.956 --> 01:29:24.559
-[panting] C'mon.
-Now!

01:29:26.727 --> 01:29:28.529
[Britt]
You fucking wankers!

01:29:28.562 --> 01:29:29.831
Come on!

01:29:35.569 --> 01:29:38.439
Here's your money with interest!

01:29:38.472 --> 01:29:40.474
[gasping]
Jesus Christ, Frenchie,

01:29:40.507 --> 01:29:42.610
what'd you do?
What have you done?

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:45.546
I got her number of the vig.
Made a deal to save your ass.

01:29:45.579 --> 01:29:47.548
-Get in!
-Get in the car, Sue.

01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:52.754
-Get in the fucking car!
-Ugh, Mal...

01:29:57.958 --> 01:29:59.093
Fuck.

01:30:04.598 --> 01:30:06.133
[tires squeal]

01:30:06.166 --> 01:30:07.769
[sirens blare]

01:30:34.027 --> 01:30:36.831
Well, I don't know, Frenchie,

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:39.166
I'm thinkin' maybe I'm gonna
head back towards Vegas.

01:30:39.199 --> 01:30:41.068
What, with that crazy bitch?

01:30:41.101 --> 01:30:42.970
Man, what can I tell you?
We're gettin' along these days.

01:30:43.003 --> 01:30:44.238
Can you imagine?

01:30:44.271 --> 01:30:45.706
Why, she mellowed with age then?

01:30:45.739 --> 01:30:47.208
Yeah, maybe she has.

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:49.610
Maybe she hasn't. Who knows?

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:52.246
What I do know is that, uh,

01:30:52.279 --> 01:30:56.650
think it's time I bring a little
balance into my life, yeah?

01:30:56.683 --> 01:30:59.920
Look, I'm sorry it didn't
go the way we wanted it
to with Tommy, mate.

01:30:59.953 --> 01:31:03.157
That's OK, Frenchie.
No need to apologize.

01:31:03.190 --> 01:31:06.026
[sigh] Not your fault, right?
We did the best we could.

01:31:06.059 --> 01:31:10.064
Tommy was big boy,
knew what he was gettin' into.

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:13.767
By the way, you remember
what I said about me and Tommy?

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:17.638
Well, we go way back,
you know? Way back.

01:31:17.671 --> 01:31:19.840
We've been
through a lot together.

01:31:19.873 --> 01:31:22.676
But... me and him never
went through what you
and I went through.

01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:24.111
So, I want you
to know somethin'.

01:31:24.144 --> 01:31:26.547
Anything you want,
any time, anywhere,

01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.549
I'll be there for you.
All right?

01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:33.053
It's funny you should say that,
actually, because, um...

01:31:33.086 --> 01:31:36.290
Had an interesting phone call
this mornin' from my old boss.

01:31:36.323 --> 01:31:39.527
He's got a mate who's settin' up
a gig in the East coast.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:42.530
And he reckons that
my temperament might
be perfect for the job.

01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:44.598
Gonna head out there.

01:31:44.631 --> 01:31:46.867
You're welcome
to join me if you want.

01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:48.903
You didn't have to take me up
on it so quick, Frenchie.

01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:50.771
[laughter]

01:31:50.804 --> 01:31:53.240
Besides, it's the East Coast.
You know, uh, it's cold.

01:31:53.273 --> 01:31:55.809
-I got brittle bones,
I'm an old man.
-Yeah.

01:31:55.842 --> 01:31:57.845
I'm gonna head back to Vegas.
It's where I need to be.

01:31:57.878 --> 01:31:59.947
-Oh, come on, mate. Come on.
-Dry heat. It's the dry heat.

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.850
No harm in seeing what they
gotta say, mate. Yeah? Come on.

01:32:02.883 --> 01:32:04.818
Security or collection?

01:32:04.851 --> 01:32:07.988
Ah... more like
collection, I think.

01:32:08.021 --> 01:32:09.323
Wait a minute. This is coming

01:32:09.356 --> 01:32:11.125
from a man who told me
he hates the job.

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:13.928
I do hate this job, mate,
but it's like you said...

01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:16.797
I'm pretty good at it.
So are you, actually.

01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:18.599
Unless you think you're
gettin' too old for it.

01:32:18.632 --> 01:32:20.000
-Fuck you, Frenchie.
-[chuckles]

01:32:20.033 --> 01:32:21.135
Come on, mate.
What d'you say?

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:22.637
-[sigh]
-Huh?

01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:26.107
I'm good.

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.643
-You sure?
-Yeah.

01:32:29.943 --> 01:32:31.679
Suit yourself, old man.

01:32:36.049 --> 01:32:37.818
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Wait a minute.

01:32:39.152 --> 01:32:40.955
What is this?

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:42.990
-I dunno, it's uh--
-Well, I'll tell you what it is!

01:32:43.023 --> 01:32:45.326
This is a 360.
It's a small block.

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:47.061
It's an AMX, yeah?

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:48.963
-Yeah.
-Seventy-two.

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:51.031
-[satisfied laugh]
-Jesus, Frenchie,
this is beautiful.

01:32:51.064 --> 01:32:52.333
I know.

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:54.301
Y'know what?
Maybe a meet and greet

01:32:54.334 --> 01:32:56.103
never hurt anybody.
Am I right?

01:32:56.136 --> 01:32:57.572
Never hurt anybody, mate.

01:32:58.772 --> 01:32:59.974
May I?

01:33:00.007 --> 01:33:02.343
You may, sir. Be my guest.

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:04.678
-Thank you, Mr. French.
-[laughs]

01:33:04.711 --> 01:33:06.080
She's a beaut', right?

01:33:06.113 --> 01:33:07.815
She's beautiful, Frenchie.
You know what?

01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:09.249
Maybe am rubbin' off on you
a little bit. Yeah?

01:33:09.282 --> 01:33:10.318
Little bit.

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:13.154
[Sue]
OK.

01:33:14.888 --> 01:33:16.624
[engine starts]

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:18.326
Ooh! [laughs]

01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:25.032
-[French] Yeah!
-[laugh]

01:33:25.065 --> 01:33:27.101
Hey. Listen, mate.
It's great,

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:29.403
but it's still fuckin'
'French,' y'know?

01:33:29.436 --> 01:33:31.271
Frenchie, don't be
so temperamental.

01:33:31.304 --> 01:33:33.040
I told you once,
I told you twice,

01:33:33.073 --> 01:33:34.642
it's a term of endearment, OK?

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:35.809
[French]
Must be out of your mind, man.

01:33:35.842 --> 01:33:38.145
[both talking simultaneously]

01:34:17.784 --> 01:34:20.421
