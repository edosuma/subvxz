<i>[Eep] Back in the Croodaceous
Era, everything we did was hard.</i>

00:35.554 --> 00:38.766

hard to spend time with family.</i>

00:38.849 --> 00:41.602
<i>[grunts]
It was even hard to relax.</i>

00:41.685 --> 00:44.146
<i>There was only one thing
we did that was easy.</i>

00:44.229 --> 00:46.097
<i>We called it "sleep,"</i>

Is it mad at me?
[gasps] I'm sorry, ground.

01:14.384 --> 01:15.678
- I could do better!
- Sh-sh-sh.

01:15.761 --> 01:18.639
It's okay, Thunk.
No one is mad at you.

01:18.764 --> 01:20.683
We're all mad at your father.

01:20.766 --> 01:23.268
Grug, please stop keeping everyone up.

Let's show this day who's boss.

02:16.697 --> 02:18.448
Take that, day.

It's so hard to wake up.

Make it a double.

02:27.958 --> 02:31.754
[groans] Bonk the neighbors
for partying so loud last night.

02:31.837 --> 02:33.756
Dumb liyotes.
[yelps]

02:33.839 --> 02:36.425
I'll get my revenge on them,
and right before I do,

02:36.508 --> 02:38.510
I'll say something cool like...

02:39.553 --> 02:41.179
"Fist punch faces now!"

02:43.724 --> 02:44.767
Huh?

02:44.850 --> 02:47.227
[gasps] That's brilliant.

02:47.310 --> 02:49.479
Why has nobody thought of this before?

02:49.563 --> 02:50.814
Family, look!

02:50.940 --> 02:53.609
The liyotes have a way to
fix their tiredness problems.

02:53.734 --> 02:58.655
We can sleep... during the day!

02:58.739 --> 03:02.242
<i>[both gasp]
Whoa!</i>

03:02.325 --> 03:04.077
Ha-ha, funny guy.

03:04.202 --> 03:07.247
What is this, late night at
the Laughing Hyena Bug Hole?

03:07.330 --> 03:08.582
[crowd laughing]

03:08.665 --> 03:11.438
And what the deal with flying food?

03:11.439 --> 03:14.212
So hard to catch, so little food.

03:14.296 --> 03:15.923
[crowd laughs]

03:16.047 --> 03:18.550
I'm serious.
Why can't we sleep now?

03:18.634 --> 03:21.804
Because people don't
sleep when the sun's out.

03:21.887 --> 03:24.055
Okay, okay, okay.
Then don't call it "sleep."

03:24.139 --> 03:27.476
Call it, um... Thunk, which of
our new words have we not used yet?

03:27.559 --> 03:31.730
Let's see, there's "kruk,"
"errrg," "scurmiggleflop," "nap."

03:31.855 --> 03:34.316
Ooh, "nap" isn't taken yet?
Perfect.

03:34.441 --> 03:38.320
- Yeah, let's take a nap.
- No, no naps, Grug. It's weird.

03:38.445 --> 03:42.032
Plus, you need to hunt today.
We are completely out of food.

03:42.115 --> 03:45.786
First of all, Ugga, I promise I'll
get to the hunt in plenty of time.

03:45.869 --> 03:48.872
And second of all...
[snores]

03:49.665 --> 03:52.001
[grunts]

03:52.083 --> 03:54.920
No, I'm not gonna sleep. Just gonna...

03:55.004 --> 03:59.174

blink for a really long ti...

03:59.257 --> 04:01.051
[all snoring]

04:03.178 --> 04:07.474
I'd say Munk, Oog, Lob, Bork, and Grug.

04:07.557 --> 04:10.268
Those are the five people
you feel most superior to?

04:10.352 --> 04:12.187
[laughs] Me, too.

04:12.270 --> 04:16.358
Oh! Snoot, look, our
smelly friends, the Croods.

04:16.440 --> 04:20.128
Sorry. That was unfair.
Our smelly neighbors, the Croods.

04:20.129 --> 04:22.698
- But what are they doing?
- Let's see.

04:22.781 --> 04:25.534
Lying down, eyes closed.

04:25.617 --> 04:27.577
Middle of the day.

04:27.661 --> 04:30.539
Mm-hmm, I see exactly what this is now.

04:30.622 --> 04:34.209
- The Croods are dead!
- Dead? How awful.

04:34.292 --> 04:36.336
This is the kind of thing
you hope never happens,

04:36.419 --> 04:38.672
or if you do, you don't
expect it to come true.

04:39.214 --> 04:41.383
Well, there's only
one decent thing to do.

04:41.466 --> 04:45.178
Take care of their bodies the
way every good caveman deserves.

04:47.806 --> 04:50.225
Yoo-hoo! Dinner time.

04:53.144 --> 04:54.897
[screams]
[snoring]

04:55.022 --> 04:56.356
[sniffing]

04:56.439 --> 05:00.694
Ugga, your breath smells like
chewed-up girelephant meat.

05:00.777 --> 05:02.696
Give me a kiss.

05:07.910 --> 05:09.202

05:36.229 --> 05:37.606
What the...

05:37.731 --> 05:41.276
We fell asleep in our cave.
How'd we get here?

05:41.359 --> 05:45.114
It was the nap, Grug.
I told you it was unnatural.

05:45.196 --> 05:47.699
Now, thanks to you, we've
unlocked its evil powers.

05:47.783 --> 05:49.492
<i>[both] Cool!</i>

05:49.576 --> 05:51.390
Now, Ugga, aren't you overreacting?

05:51.391 --> 05:53.966
I mean, sure, we got a
few scrapes, but now that

05:53.967 --> 05:56.741
we're rested, I can join the
hunt just like I promised.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.046
[Amber] Bring it in.
Hunt over for today.

06:01.922 --> 06:04.507
[chuckles] Also, have I ever
told you how pretty you are?

06:04.633 --> 06:07.844
[growls]
I'll get food. Don't maul me!

06:07.928 --> 06:12.015
Before hunters go, Snoot
just share sad news.

06:12.099 --> 06:18.229
Amber not sure how to say this,
but the Croods... am dead.

06:18.313 --> 06:22.442
- The Croods "are" dead.
- Oh, right. That how you say it.

06:22.525 --> 06:27.447
No, not the Croods!
I was Grug's only friend.

06:27.530 --> 06:29.616
No, wait, he was my only friend.

06:29.699 --> 06:31.827
<i>Guys, over here.</i>

06:31.910 --> 06:36.386
Was sleeping on a bear.
It's a long... you know,

06:36.421 --> 06:40.085
<i>you, uh, think you could, uh,
share some of today's catch?</i>

06:40.169 --> 06:42.712
Uh...

06:42.796 --> 06:45.381
Amber may be asking dumb question,

06:45.465 --> 06:48.593
but if Grug dead, how come
he standing over there?

06:48.677 --> 06:50.053
Well, let's think.

06:50.137 --> 06:53.797
First, he was dead, but
now, he's back from the dead,

06:53.832 --> 06:56.852
which means he must be...
[gasps] undead.

06:56.935 --> 06:59.312
[all gasp]
So, what do you say?

06:59.395 --> 07:01.439
Can you spare me a
couple of those chickunas?

07:01.564 --> 07:03.192
[all gasp]
Monster!

07:03.274 --> 07:05.110
<i>[Amber] Monster!</i>

07:06.569 --> 07:09.405
Okay, how about just one chickuna?

07:09.489 --> 07:11.908
- Crood creature!
- Man-beast!

07:11.992 --> 07:12.993
[panting]

07:15.204 --> 07:18.665
Hello?
Where'd everybody go?

07:19.916 --> 07:21.459
Are you guys hiding from me?

07:21.584 --> 07:24.963
- The monster has me in his grip!
- Monster?

07:25.047 --> 07:26.882
Where... Ow!

07:27.007 --> 07:29.425
[panting] Monster, stay away.

07:29.509 --> 07:30.886
Why do you keep saying that?

07:31.011 --> 07:34.305
- I'm not a monster.
- Ha! We saw you dead,

07:34.389 --> 07:37.893
laying with your eyes
closed, during the day!

07:38.018 --> 07:41.065
What, that?
Oh, no, no, no.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.648
I was sleeping.
Yeah, it's called a "nap."

07:43.732 --> 07:48.737
Nice try, but a nap isn't a thing,
so your story is just a bunch of...

07:48.820 --> 07:51.769
- Meep, what's that word we made up?
- "Gunderchuck."

07:51.804 --> 07:53.700
It's a bunch of gunderchuck, monster.

07:53.825 --> 07:55.368
Hey, guys, where you going?

07:55.451 --> 07:57.245
[screams]

07:57.246 --> 07:59.699
The undead are everywhere!

08:01.833 --> 08:06.296
- We have to fix this right now.
- Fix what? This is great.

08:06.379 --> 08:08.590
Grug, they think we're monsters.

08:08.715 --> 08:12.794
Correction. Monsters with free food.

08:14.263 --> 08:16.639
[shouts]

08:20.602 --> 08:21.895
Well, it's official.

08:21.978 --> 08:24.147
Naps are the best thing
that ever happened to us.

08:24.231 --> 08:26.524
- Am I right, kids?
- [both] Right, Dad.

08:26.608 --> 08:29.278
Grug, you're not thinking this through.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.030
Yes, I am.
Thinking what through?

08:32.155 --> 08:35.116
How everyone believing we're
undead will affect this family.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.159
<i>[Snoot] Help, help!</i>

08:37.244 --> 08:42.124
<i>I have so much free food
and no way to carry it all.</i>

08:42.207 --> 08:43.292
<i>Help!</i>

08:43.374 --> 08:46.920
Hm, sounds like another chance
to scare up some more grub.

08:47.003 --> 08:52.217
[grunts] This is a bad idea, Grug.
Something's not right here.

08:52.301 --> 08:55.804
Don't be scared, Ugga.
We're the monsters, remember?

08:55.887 --> 08:56.805
[laughs]

08:56.888 --> 09:01.017
Help! Quick, before the
undead Croods find...

09:01.101 --> 09:03.805
[gulps] me.

09:04.854 --> 09:06.982

Whoa! Okay.

09:23.539 --> 09:26.084
[nervous chuckle] Sorry, guys.
No need for rocks.

09:26.168 --> 09:27.294
Uh, we're not undead.

09:27.377 --> 09:31.422
[laughing] That was all just a
big misunderstanding, right? Right?

09:31.506 --> 09:32.715
[chuckling] Yeah, that's the truth.

09:32.799 --> 09:34.634
- [chuckles] Yep.
- Totally.

09:34.717 --> 09:37.762
Monster bonkers, attack!

09:37.887 --> 09:41.015
<i>Okay, run for your lives!

09:44.894 --> 09:46.479

09:47.480 --> 09:49.274
[all scream]

09:49.358 --> 09:52.110
Okay, I admit it. Naps are
the worst idea in the history

09:52.111 --> 09:54.863
<i>of everything, and I wish we
never saw those stupid liyotes.</i>

09:54.946 --> 09:58.908
Liyotes? I think I have
a plan to prove we're not undead.

10:03.496 --> 10:05.832
[all grunt]

10:05.915 --> 10:09.378
[groans]
Your plan, it needs work, Mom.

10:10.045 --> 10:11.254
Ready!

10:11.338 --> 10:13.965
No! No, please!
We were just sleeping.

10:14.049 --> 10:17.593
Naps are real.
Look! [whimpers]

10:18.178 --> 10:21.764
Aim!
[yawns]

10:21.848 --> 10:23.599
[snores]

10:23.725 --> 10:25.935
<i>[all] Whoa...</i>

10:26.019 --> 10:28.688
So, you see what this means, right?

10:28.771 --> 10:33.068
Yes. The touch of your cold,
undead hand killed that liyote.

10:33.151 --> 10:37.406
No, this means
the Croods weren't lying.

10:37.530 --> 10:41.201
It is possible to sleep during the day.

10:41.284 --> 10:44.204
It so beautiful.

10:45.747 --> 10:48.708
Sorry about the confusion.
Here's the food we took.

10:48.791 --> 10:51.420
[burps] Most of it.

10:51.544 --> 10:54.839
Thank you.
Amber glad Croods not dead.

10:54.964 --> 10:56.758
<i>[all] Aw!</i>

10:58.843 --> 11:03.348
- What do you want?
- Um, you scared me... a lot.

11:03.473 --> 11:05.475
I think that earns me something.

11:06.976 --> 11:09.438
<i>I liked you better as monsters!</i>

11:09.520 --> 11:12.441
Croods, I think we learned
an important lesson today.

11:12.523 --> 11:15.985
Even when you're tired, never
take shortcuts in life, because...

11:16.069 --> 11:17.404
Ugga?

11:17.487 --> 11:20.531
[yawns] Yeah, yeah, I know
they're evil, but face it.

11:20.656 --> 11:23.410
Ah, naps feel so good.

11:24.535 --> 11:25.954
<i>[all] Yeah!</i>

11:40.218 --> 11:43.012
All right, Croods, 
it's time for our new game,

11:43.096 --> 11:44.722
"Keep away the Sandy."

11:44.806 --> 11:47.434
[all cheer]

11:47.517 --> 11:50.728
Teams are me and Eep versus
Ugga and Thunk versus...

11:50.812 --> 11:52.688
You sure you don't
want a teammate, Gran?

11:52.772 --> 11:55.237
Teams are for the weak. Let's play!

11:57.026 --> 11:58.861
Who's Daddy's little throwing thingy?

11:58.945 --> 12:00.613
[laughs]

[giggles]

12:04.659 --> 12:07.703
Watch out! 
She just wet her pelt!

12:07.787 --> 12:09.622
[yelps]

12:09.705 --> 12:10.957
[laughs, grunts]

12:11.040 --> 12:13.751
<i>[laughs]
[both] I got her!</i>

12:13.835 --> 12:16.421
[groans]
Go long, Thunk!

12:18.214 --> 12:20.883
[groans] The other long, Thunk.

12:24.095 --> 12:25.347

[slurping]

12:29.267 --> 12:31.602
[gasps, screams]

12:31.686 --> 12:35.023
[laughs] Wait. There's
stuff inside these nests?

12:38.067 --> 12:41.196
[laughs giddily]

12:41.279 --> 12:45.116
It tastes like happiness
and fun hugging each other.

12:52.374 --> 12:54.083
<i>[man] I wouldn't eat that if I were you.</i>

12:54.167 --> 12:58.421
- Who said that?
- Oh, it's just that talking bush.

12:58.505 --> 13:01.466
What's his name? 
Uh... Old Man Poop?

13:01.550 --> 13:03.134
It's Old Man Root!

13:03.218 --> 13:06.304
Old Man Poop's my brother,
and I'm warnin' you.

13:06.388 --> 13:11.560
That stuff, that soo-gar 
that you're eatin', it's no good.

13:11.642 --> 13:16.856
Sure it tastes great, makes you
feel stronger, faster, invincible...

13:16.939 --> 13:19.401
Exactly. Thanks for telling
us what we already know.

13:19.484 --> 13:22.028
- Bye.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

13:22.153 --> 13:24.989
I was just about to tell
you soo-gar's downside.

13:25.073 --> 13:26.074
<i>[Gran] Not interested.</i>

13:26.157 --> 13:28.618

13:49.347 --> 13:51.717
[chomping]

13:53.643 --> 13:56.229
Why did we ever eat anything else?

13:56.312 --> 13:59.608
Yeah. It makes everything
else taste better, too.

14:07.115 --> 14:11.369
[moans] Yeah. Now, I can't
imagine eating rocks without it.

14:11.494 --> 14:13.162
I have so much more energy.

14:13.288 --> 14:15.624
I feel like I could go
a whole hour without napping.

14:15.665 --> 14:18.000
And my mouth can't keep
up with all the words

14:18.001 --> 14:20.336
- coming out of my brain!
- I just wanna yell!

14:20.420 --> 14:22.797
Ooh, I've never felt so alive.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.634
[laughs] Let's get
outside and start living!

14:25.716 --> 14:27.009
<i>[all] Yeah!</i>

14:29.804 --> 14:31.514
After one more taste.

14:37.145 --> 14:41.232
Amber need one man on
left and one man on right.

14:41.316 --> 14:43.359
You both most likely get eaten.

14:44.026 --> 14:45.695
Volunteers?

14:45.778 --> 14:48.114
[hunters whistle]
I'll do it all!

14:48.197 --> 14:49.407
<i>[all] Shh!</i>

14:53.202 --> 14:55.580
Amber have what Grug having.

14:56.914 --> 14:57.957
[yelps]

14:59.668 --> 15:01.711
Gathering has never been so much fun.

15:01.794 --> 15:05.298
I know! I wanna gather everything!

15:06.466 --> 15:08.801
I... I've been gathered.

15:08.884 --> 15:11.804
You belong to us now!

15:15.350 --> 15:17.602
Gah! Is school always this boring?

15:17.686 --> 15:20.313
My mind says, "Sit still," but
the soo-gar says, "Go, go, go!"

15:20.438 --> 15:22.524
Really? I feel totally fine.

15:23.358 --> 15:26.777
Thunk and Eep, since you two
think your pointless talking

15:26.861 --> 15:29.071
is more important than
my pointless talking,

15:29.155 --> 15:31.032
maybe you'd like to teach the class.

15:31.115 --> 15:33.034
<i>[both] Okay!</i>

15:33.535 --> 15:37.664
New lesson! Everyone watch how fast
Thunk and I can jump up and down!

15:37.747 --> 15:41.167
[both laugh]

15:43.961 --> 15:46.548
Hm. Beats the lesson I had planned.

15:46.673 --> 15:49.718
[laughing continues]

15:49.842 --> 15:52.512
[Grug laughing]

15:52.595 --> 15:56.766
Huh, so Grug do whole hunt by self.
That cool.

15:56.849 --> 16:01.145
Amber guess Amber just stand
around like idiot, then.

16:01.229 --> 16:05.066
Grug Crood is on top
and never coming down!

16:05.149 --> 16:06.735
[grunts]

16:06.817 --> 16:09.820
[groans]

16:09.945 --> 16:11.781
Huh. I crashed.

16:11.864 --> 16:13.866
[buzzing]

16:13.949 --> 16:16.619
I think we can all agree
that the fair thing to do

16:16.703 --> 16:19.316
would be to give me a head start.

16:20.790 --> 16:22.584
[screams]

16:22.667 --> 16:24.085
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

16:24.168 --> 16:25.294
[screams]

16:26.003 --> 16:28.631
I need soo-gar.

16:28.715 --> 16:32.635
- Uh, what's going on?
- Maybe he took it!

16:34.637 --> 16:37.265
<i>Hmm, his mouth's clean.</i>

16:37.973 --> 16:40.351
Gonna have to check his nose.

16:40.435 --> 16:43.479
[Gran yelps] Dad didn't
take our soo-gar, Gran.

16:43.605 --> 16:47.776
But if he did and shared it with
his teammate, she'd understand.

16:47.858 --> 16:52.071
- Huh? Wink?
- No. No! Our soo-gar can't be gone!

16:52.196 --> 16:54.240
None of us would ever be that...

16:54.323 --> 16:56.075
[grunts]
...mean.

16:56.200 --> 16:59.537
Me? But Thunk's the one
who can't lay off food.

16:59.621 --> 17:03.958
He's always snackin' between meals
and eatin' meals between snacks.

17:04.875 --> 17:06.461
Me? But... but...

17:06.544 --> 17:09.088
Sandy's the one we can't trust.
[Sandy snarls]

17:09.171 --> 17:11.758
[gasps] She's always attacking
me when I'm not looking.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.509
[shouts]

17:13.593 --> 17:16.095
Hey! Stop fighting!

17:16.178 --> 17:19.682
No one should accuse
anyone without proof.

17:19.766 --> 17:24.019
Huh. Sounds like just the kind of
thing a guilty person would say, Mom,

17:24.103 --> 17:27.272
- if that's your real name.
- [all] Yeah!

17:27.356 --> 17:30.777
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!
You guys are goin' down.

17:30.860 --> 17:33.863
[roars]
[all scream]

17:35.948 --> 17:37.784
<i>[growling]
[Old Man Root] Well, well, well.</i>

17:37.867 --> 17:41.954
Guess y'all didn't listen to
Old Man Root's warning, did you?

17:42.037 --> 17:43.623
And now, look at you.

17:43.748 --> 17:46.479
At each other's throats
like a bunch of throat

17:46.480 --> 17:49.211
gophers would be, if
such things existed.

17:49.337 --> 17:51.398
Is this what you want?!
[all gasp]

17:52.173 --> 17:55.259
Well, I'm takin' it for your own good.

17:55.343 --> 17:59.221
[all growl]

18:01.432 --> 18:02.642
He's right, guys.

18:02.725 --> 18:06.020
Old Man Root, I bow to your wisdom.

18:06.103 --> 18:11.526
[chuckling] Well, not to be cocky,
but it's about time I got some resp...

18:11.651 --> 18:13.778
[shouts]

18:24.789 --> 18:27.082
- Mine!
- No, it's mine!

18:48.270 --> 18:51.357
Bad Sandy. Drop it! Heel!

18:52.692 --> 18:55.403
Uh-oh.
Those guys don't look happy.

19:03.828 --> 19:06.956
<i>[Croods] Nooo!</i>

I mean, Sandy!

[giggling]

19:15.320 --> 19:16.881
_

19:17.299 --> 19:19.260
Mommy's coming, Sandy,

19:19.385 --> 19:22.555
and we're bringing all
our soo-gar power with us.

[all groan]

19:27.059 --> 19:29.938
Oh, no. The crash.

19:30.020 --> 19:33.858
They're getting away with our
Sandy and it's all our fault.

19:33.942 --> 19:38.446
Yeah. If only you
hadn't been so selfish.

19:38.529 --> 19:40.698
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:40.823 --> 19:45.620
Me?
Okay, yes, I have been selfish.

19:45.703 --> 19:47.496
<i>[buzzing]
[Ugga] Ew.</i>

19:47.622 --> 19:51.542
I hid it to keep it from
you all. I'm sorry, family.

19:51.626 --> 19:54.796
[gasps] I'm shocked, Dad.

19:54.879 --> 19:59.425
Or I would be if I hadn't
done the exact same thing.

20:01.218 --> 20:04.847
Oh, let's just agree that no
one's very proud of themselves.

20:06.891 --> 20:08.309
[buzzing]
[Sandy giggles]

20:08.434 --> 20:10.812
We only have enough soo-gar
for one shot at this.

20:10.895 --> 20:12.062
Ready, Croods?

20:16.358 --> 20:18.235
[both grunt]

[Gran shouts]

20:20.070 --> 20:22.573
Eep, you don't think
this will hurt, do you?

20:22.657 --> 20:27.578
Um, I wanna say no, but...

been keeping another secret.

22:01.047 --> 22:04.341
So, I think we discovered
that downside to soo-gar

22:04.425 --> 22:06.343
that Old Man Root was talking about.

22:06.427 --> 22:09.471
Oh, yeah. Let's sleep this off.

22:09.555 --> 22:14.018
One step ahead of ya.

[Thunk sighs]

22:15.937 --> 22:17.772
[all snore]

22:17.855 --> 22:21.025
Hey, we had a lot of laughs today,

22:21.150 --> 22:24.278
but eatin' too much soo-gar
is no laughin' matter.

22:24.361 --> 22:28.490
Every day in Ahhh!
Valley, tens of cavemen

22:28.491 --> 22:32.620
fall victim to its sweet,
sweet, sweet embrace.

Who are you talking to?
