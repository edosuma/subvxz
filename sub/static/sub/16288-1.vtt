00:41.458 --> 00:42.958
November 1958,

00:43.001 --> 00:45.210
my senior year of high school.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.546
While other girls were dancing to Elvis

00:47.630 --> 00:49.131
and dreaming about prom dates,

00:49.174 --> 00:51.675
I was reading Jane Austen
and dreaming about college.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.637
And then my parents announced
we were moving to Cuba.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.014
In a week.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.860
Slamming doors and
giving the silent treatment

01:09.944 --> 01:11.153
couldn't change that,

01:11.196 --> 01:13.947
but it was easier than admitting
I was really scared.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.741
At least everyone else was happy.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.951
Dad got his big promotion from Ford,

01:18.161 --> 01:19.745
Mom got to travel in style

01:19.829 --> 01:21.330
and Susie...

01:21.372 --> 01:24.166
I swear that girl could adjust in a hurricane.

02:28.022 --> 02:29.857
Welcome to the Hotel Oceana.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.923
Not too shabby.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.677
Here's what I know about Cuba.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.096
My high school French
wasn't going to help me,

03:01.389 --> 03:03.140
I didn't know a single person,

03:03.224 --> 03:04.892
and though no one would talk about it,

03:04.934 --> 03:07.352
Fidel Castro was leading
the people in a revolution

03:07.437 --> 03:09.104
against President Batista.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.523
Not that you would know it from this place.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.614
This is Cuba.
Nobody cares what you do here.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.240
Susie, you want a smoke?

03:20.867 --> 03:23.118
Watch out for this one.
She's a bad influence.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.494
I'll take that as a compliment.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.289
She'll have you ditching classes in no time.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.626
As I recall, there's a certain someone
that likes to ditch them with me.

03:32.420 --> 03:37.216
Don't forget to sign up for mambo lessons.
Mambo classes are held every day...

03:37.300 --> 03:39.885
My God. June Cleaver is in Havana.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.431
Actually, that's my sister Katey.
She's a real brain.

03:45.892 --> 03:46.892
Really?

03:47.644 --> 03:49.144
Yeah. She's probably going to Radcliffe.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.854
What, majoring in fashion?

03:53.775 --> 03:54.816
Why don't you join us?

03:56.110 --> 03:57.194
There's room here.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.702
I'm James Phelps.

04:05.787 --> 04:06.995
Hi. Katey Miller.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.163
Pleasure to meet you.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.666
- Are you the...
- Yeah.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.125
Your dad works for my dad.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.502
Yeah.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.923
This is Sheila, Eve, Polly and Steph,

04:18.173 --> 04:19.716
and I guess you know Susie, right?

04:21.511 --> 04:22.803
So, are you really going to Radcliffe?

04:23.054 --> 04:24.263
I won't know till spring.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.139
Watch out, girls.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.893
I guess if your head's in your books,
you really don't have time

04:29.978 --> 04:32.187
to think about silly things like the weather.

04:33.856 --> 04:34.898
Chilly?

04:39.320 --> 04:42.322
- Shit!
- I'm so sorry. It's my fault.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.491
No, just go get new drinks.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.581
Stupid spic.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.129
Excuse me.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.307
Excuse me. Señor?

05:08.391 --> 05:09.725
How may I help you, señorita?

05:09.809 --> 05:11.852
I knocked into those drinks.
I'd like to pay for them.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.270
That will not be necessary.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.230
Accidents happen. Excuse me.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.154
I speak English.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.198
And I don't need your charity.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.701
It's not.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.995
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.207
I'm sorry for what she called you.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.168
- That was nothing.
- Not to me.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.753
Then why are you apologizing?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.472
You guys were so good.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.932
Your mother was good. I was...

05:51.392 --> 05:52.392
Okay.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.436
Dad?

05:56.314 --> 05:58.106
I'm sorry I haven't been

05:58.775 --> 06:00.609
excited about all of this.

06:03.821 --> 06:04.988
Sweetheart, it's okay.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.949
Senior year is a terrible time
to drag you out of school,

06:09.452 --> 06:10.994
especially when you're the star of the class.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.288
- Dad.
- Come on. Don't deny it.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.165
Be proud of it.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.709
You'll do great here, too.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.227
I can't stand on your feet anymore.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.443
Hey, you remembered that.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.530
Very good.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.785
Let's continue where we left off.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.454
Book 18, page 285.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.332
Katey, just do your best to
follow along, all right?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.334
It's okay. I read it last year.

07:00.753 --> 07:01.837
Knock it off.

07:02.171 --> 07:05.590
Well, then perhaps you'd like
to begin reading at line 342.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.345
"Now the suitors turned to dance and song,

07:10.930 --> 07:12.931
"to the lovely beaten sway,

07:13.808 --> 07:16.518
"waiting for dusk to come upon them there,

07:16.811 --> 07:19.354
"and the dark night came upon them

07:19.689 --> 07:21.022
"lost in pleasure."

07:25.069 --> 07:28.864
Can anyone tell us
the significance of this passage?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.366
It's a bunch of drunk guys doing it.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.206
Athena

07:38.958 --> 07:41.918
wants the suitors
to keep invading Odysseus' house

07:42.003 --> 07:44.337
so that he'll get angry enough to kill them.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.381
And why does the goddess want that?

07:49.177 --> 07:51.970
She wants Odysseus to find his strength

07:53.181 --> 07:54.556
and courage?

07:54.891 --> 07:55.891
Very good.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.909
Need a ride home?

08:16.746 --> 08:19.998
No. I'm okay.
I got a lot of catching up to do.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.585
You know, a lot of girls
don't like to let on when they're smart.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.588
- I know. I shouldn't have said that.
- No. No, I like that.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.549
I like that about you.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.556
A bunch of us are going to our
country club on Saturday night.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.809
There'll be a band. The music's pretty cool.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.439
Would you like to go with me?

08:46.025 --> 08:48.151
I really do have a lot of work to do.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.486
On a Saturday night?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.113
Wow.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.535
Come on. I'm sure even Homer
took some time off

08:56.619 --> 08:58.370
between The lliad and The Odyssey.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.290
Well, sure. Okay.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.251
Okay.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.301
We're all here now. You can go.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.412
Bonita.

10:51.859 --> 10:52.942
Eso.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.707
You felt a sudden urge for Cuban music?

11:08.125 --> 11:09.542
The van left without me.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.461
I've been walking for an hour.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.464
- I can walk you back.
- No. You don't have to do that.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.257
Yeah, you're right.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.176
You'll find your way sooner or later.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.553
Maybe in a week or a month.

11:21.847 --> 11:22.972
Let me just say goodbye.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.557
Abuelito!

11:31.565 --> 11:32.732
Bueno.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.070
What was it you called him?

11:37.279 --> 11:39.614
Abuelito. It's my grandpa.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.035
I'm Katey. What's your name?

11:44.495 --> 11:45.495
Javier.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.749
So what, you know, like,
five words in Spanish?

11:50.126 --> 11:51.251
Maybe 10.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.337
And what are you studying so hard to do?

11:54.588 --> 11:56.589
I haven't figured it out yet.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.633
Here. Let me take that.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.015
I've never seen dancing like that.

12:07.685 --> 12:08.810
Like what?

12:09.687 --> 12:10.812
I don't know.

12:11.897 --> 12:12.981
I like it.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.524
It's very...

12:18.487 --> 12:19.487
Very Cuban?

12:19.613 --> 12:20.655
Yeah.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.310
We should get off the street.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.229
- Why?
- You don't understand what they're singing.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.489
No!

13:03.157 --> 13:04.407
That way!

13:07.036 --> 13:09.537
So you've got... Okay. Here she is.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.747
Thank you so much.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.708
Thank God. Katey, where have you been?

13:15.669 --> 13:16.795
I missed the bus.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.047
I'm fine. I walked.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.966
For heaven's sakes.
Katey, why didn't you call me?

13:22.259 --> 13:24.928
For all I knew, you could have
been kidnapped by rebels.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.931
It's not the rebels
you should be worried about.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.224
What did you say?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.729
You're right.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.065
I'm sorry. I should have called.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.441
Honey, where's your book bag?

13:42.071 --> 13:43.530
I left it at school.

13:44.406 --> 13:45.406
It was heavy.

14:36.750 --> 14:37.750
Oh, God.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.628
It was good I had all these
boring American books with me.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.131
They realized I couldn't be a revolutionary.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.341
I don't understand.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.468
They were just singing.

14:47.678 --> 14:50.346
There's not such a thing as
just singing here anymore.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.394
You know, you're a pretty good dancer.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.355
I was terrible.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.942
Yeah. Yeah, you were terrible,

15:03.569 --> 15:05.445
but for an American, you move well.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.738
Thanks.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.995
Why do you look in the mirror?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.831
I was trying to remember the steps I saw.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.167
But what does looking have to do with it?

15:20.377 --> 15:22.378
Just... Just feel the music.

15:23.672 --> 15:24.923
You should see for yourself.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.385
The real dancers are
at La Rosa Negra on Saturday night.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.014
I can't.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.602
I got invited to this country club thing.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.396
- Hey, that was fast.
- Yeah.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.523
Is that why you want to learn
Cuban dancing?

15:43.359 --> 15:44.525
Just to impress your date?

15:45.527 --> 15:47.320
- No. I wanted to...
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.030
They won't dance like that at the club.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.032
Just learn the foxtrot instead.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.286
I already know the foxtrot.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.803
Do we need to go shopping?

16:12.471 --> 16:15.139
I just thought you might be going
to the country club Saturday night.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.684
You just thought?

16:17.726 --> 16:19.602
Mrs. Phelps took me to lunch.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.397
You two aren't planning
an arranged marriage, are you?

16:22.439 --> 16:23.773
No. I should have thought of that.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.901
He's so cute.

16:28.862 --> 16:37.870
Do you, do you, do you
do you wanna dance?

16:38.914 --> 16:40.623
- Yolanda?
- Yes?

16:42.334 --> 16:43.543
Is this square?

16:44.878 --> 16:46.087
Square?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.380
Yeah, you know,

16:47.673 --> 16:48.756
like a square?

16:50.217 --> 16:52.010
Is a square good or bad?

16:53.220 --> 16:54.220
It's bad.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.264
Sí.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.682
Is a square.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.475
Oh, God.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.645
I don't know.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.107
You're smaller than me. Your dresses'll be...

17:07.192 --> 17:08.317
Perfect.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.487
You're joking.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.156
Why? Is it square?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.577
Definitely not.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.619
It's not fair!

17:20.955 --> 17:22.415
All of my friends are going.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.083
So why would you go, and I can't?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.377
I am older than you.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.088
Such a waste.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.673
You don't even know how to have fun.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.358
Sure you don't want me to stay?

17:50.986 --> 17:52.320
Dad, don't.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.615
Okay. Bye.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.829
Be careful.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.020
Polly.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.237
God, what'd she do? Paint it on?

18:35.614 --> 18:36.906
Señorita.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.204
Wow!

18:44.540 --> 18:45.915
I don't know.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.708
I do.

18:51.004 --> 18:54.090
I would like to invite you all
to the Club Palace on Christmas Eve...

18:54.174 --> 18:55.383
You been to the Palace yet?

18:55.425 --> 18:59.554
...to attend the annual
Latin ballroom amateur dance contest.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.805
I'll have to take you.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.497
You feel really good.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.083
Am I making you nervous?

19:29.835 --> 19:30.877
No.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.421
Well, you make me a little nervous,

19:34.089 --> 19:35.381
but don't tell anyone.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.425
It'll ruin my reputation.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.434
Listen, we're going over to Polly's
for a little mojito party.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.602
Yeah?

19:47.644 --> 19:49.228
Yeah, her parents are out of town again.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.605
What do you think?

19:50.814 --> 19:52.773
Steph can make a wicked mojito.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.318
Well...

19:55.444 --> 19:58.321
Hey, I'm sure we can get someone
to rustle you up a Shirley Temple.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.616
Actually,

20:02.576 --> 20:05.161
James and I are gonna go to a Cuban club.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.621
Where?

20:07.664 --> 20:08.873
La Rosa Negra.

20:10.876 --> 20:14.295
Yeah, we're going to the La Rosa Negra.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.475
Jesus.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.668
Look at the way they feel the music.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.714
They're feeling it, all right.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.887
I'll get us some drinks.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.295
Hi.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.131
You look so Cuban.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.299
So do you.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.386
Hi. I'm Javier.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.472
James Phelps.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.016
Yeah. I know you.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.893
So, the country club
wasn't all you expected?

21:54.104 --> 21:56.397
We thought we'd expand
our horizons a little bit.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.358
You mean actually experience Havana?

22:03.530 --> 22:05.239
Do you mind if I dance with your date?

22:08.910 --> 22:10.077
Well, you'll have to ask her.

22:12.748 --> 22:13.789
Okay.

22:17.127 --> 22:21.672
Te quiero, Havana
The rhythm pumpin' in my heart

22:21.757 --> 22:23.591
In La Rosa

22:23.675 --> 22:26.969
We dance to the tempo of love

22:27.262 --> 22:28.929
Shall we give your boyfriend a show?

22:30.265 --> 22:31.640
He's not my boyfriend.

22:31.892 --> 22:36.312
Let your body talk
Till the voice in you says

22:36.396 --> 22:37.855
Say, baby

22:37.939 --> 22:41.525
I'm the one you find deep in the groove

22:41.610 --> 22:47.448
That drives your body and your senses

22:47.616 --> 22:52.536
I'm the heat inside
When rhythm and love collide

22:52.621 --> 22:53.621
Cuba

22:53.663 --> 22:57.583
Let me introduce myself

Lose your date?

23:24.027 --> 23:26.404
Must be that Yankee
dancing with my brother.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.158
Good of you to bring
your girlfriend to Havana

23:31.243 --> 23:32.493
while you still have the chance.

23:33.829 --> 23:34.912
Why?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.748
Are you gonna run us gringos out?

23:38.417 --> 23:41.085
That's right, comebola, so keep smiling.

23:43.713 --> 23:47.174

Raoul y Esmerelda,

24:24.713 --> 24:26.630
king and queen of La Rosa Negra.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.638
When they dance, the floor is theirs.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.955
You're as good a dancer as he is.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.048
Katey, this is my brother Carlos.

25:10.091 --> 25:11.717
- Arturo and Miguel.
- Hola.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.801
Hola.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.930
We were just talking politics.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.766
Really? Well, my brother loves talking.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.768
Javier doesn't like to talk politics.

25:21.061 --> 25:24.146
After all, the revolution
would screw up his job kissing your asses.

25:24.272 --> 25:25.648
And where's the revolution tonight?

25:25.732 --> 25:26.982
On the dance floor?

25:28.818 --> 25:32.613
While you boys kiss and make up,
we're gonna get some fresh air.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.323
Let's go.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.210
I was enjoying the dancing.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.795
You...

25:47.837 --> 25:49.213
You were very hot.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.556
It's not the safest part of town.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.268
No, don't.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.854
Take me home, will you...

26:07.148 --> 26:08.148
Stop it!

26:08.233 --> 26:09.358
Get off!

26:10.735 --> 26:12.194
You didn't say no to him.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.244
Katey!

26:20.495 --> 26:22.955
Katey, get back in the damn car!
I'll take you home.

26:29.462 --> 26:32.172
Hey.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.509
Where is he?

26:35.552 --> 26:38.470
He's gone. He's gone.
It's okay. It's okay, I'm fine.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.726
My dad works for his dad.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.729
I just want to forget about it.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.190
Don't worry.

26:50.650 --> 26:51.734
I'll take you home.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.528
Come on.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.365
I should have seen it coming.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.327
I guess I'm not used to...

27:01.369 --> 27:02.411
Bastards?

27:02.829 --> 27:03.829
Guys.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.707
What? You never had
a boyfriend in America?

27:07.792 --> 27:11.712
No. I liked this one guy,
but it didn't work out.

27:11.755 --> 27:12.755
Why not?

27:12.881 --> 27:14.381
He didn't know I existed.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.967
Yeah. That could be a problem.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.556
This is as far as I go.

27:23.933 --> 27:26.560
The staff is not supposed to
mix with guests.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.188
It took me a long time to find this job.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.440
You'd be in trouble for walking me up there?

27:31.608 --> 27:32.775
Yeah.

27:33.693 --> 27:34.860
It's ridiculous.

27:46.790 --> 27:47.831
Adiós.

27:51.252 --> 27:52.753
Thanks for walking me home.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.423
I'm sorry your evening was

27:57.258 --> 27:58.258
so difficult.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.387
Not all of it was.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.881
My job is to make you look beautiful.

28:37.966 --> 28:41.135
Your job is to make
our bodies like one. Watch.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.433
Thanks.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.560
Okay, that's it for today.

29:32.312 --> 29:35.606
Who's gonna enter
the big dance contest?

29:35.690 --> 29:36.940
Isn't it just for locals?

29:37.108 --> 29:39.276
Actually, it's for anyone
who has the guts to try.

29:39.861 --> 29:40.861
What about you?

29:42.113 --> 29:43.155
Me?

29:44.532 --> 29:46.033
No, I can't. I'm not good enough.

29:47.368 --> 29:49.203
Sure you are. I've seen you practicing.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.043
Easy.

30:06.429 --> 30:07.638
Think about it.

30:14.896 --> 30:15.896
Katey!

30:16.439 --> 30:18.524
You left your sweater in my car. I...

30:18.566 --> 30:20.400
- Just bring it to school.
- Hey, wait a second.

30:21.069 --> 30:22.152
Katey.

30:24.405 --> 30:25.447
I'm really sorry.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.700
I was drinking. I would never hurt you.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.204
He's not here.

30:34.874 --> 30:35.916
They fired him.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.501
What?

30:38.086 --> 30:41.088
Lois and your sister, they saw you.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.425
I'm sorry.

30:46.553 --> 30:47.553
I gotta go.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.607
You know,
you need to keep your mouth shut.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.276
The things you do have consequences.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.944
Lois is the one who blabbed it.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.404
Right.

31:05.822 --> 31:07.531
And you had nothing to do with it.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.242
Well, what were you doing
with that guy, anyway?

31:10.451 --> 31:11.535
It's embarrassing.

31:12.078 --> 31:14.121
Is that you talking, or is it those other girls?

31:14.622 --> 31:15.956
He's not like us.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.208
There is no us, Susie.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.766
- Hola.
- Hola.

31:40.523 --> 31:41.523
Sí.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.484
Yes?

31:44.611 --> 31:46.111
I'm a friend of Javier's.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.571
Cómo?

31:48.323 --> 31:49.323
From the hotel.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.369
I didn't know he had friends in the hotel.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.247
Is he here?

31:58.249 --> 32:00.834
No. He's working there now.

32:01.544 --> 32:02.920
You don't see him?

32:15.558 --> 32:16.558
So...

32:17.518 --> 32:18.894
What do you want with my brother?

32:19.270 --> 32:20.687
I need to talk to him.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.191
You got him fired. Isn't that enough?

32:27.570 --> 32:29.488
I know a way he can make some money.

32:30.865 --> 32:34.326
You Yankees, you come here,
and you pour money into the casinos,

32:34.369 --> 32:36.870
into the pockets
of the gangsters who run this country,

32:37.163 --> 32:40.666
the same gangsters
who murder innocent people, like my father.

32:41.417 --> 32:42.542
I didn't know.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.253
That's right. You don't know.

32:55.682 --> 32:56.932
Javi.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.440
I feel terrible about what happened.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.317
- I went to your house...
- My house?

33:07.402 --> 33:08.819
You told my mother I was fired?

33:08.903 --> 33:10.570
- No, I didn't.
- So what do you want?

33:10.655 --> 33:11.905
I told her I wanted to talk to you.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.449
I'm sorry you got fired.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.578
Don't worry. It's my fault. I knew better.

33:20.581 --> 33:21.832
Is this your new job?

33:22.291 --> 33:24.710
That's right. You make them. We steal them.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.712
Isn't that right, Javi?

33:32.468 --> 33:33.927
There's this...

33:34.846 --> 33:38.432
This dance contest
at the Palace, Christmas Eve.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.018
I think you should go.

33:41.936 --> 33:43.353
And see if they need any busboys?

33:44.564 --> 33:45.605
That's not what I mean.

33:45.648 --> 33:47.441
You know what kind of people
goes to the Palace?

33:49.277 --> 33:50.485
I could get you in.

33:51.487 --> 33:53.113
You'd have to be my partner.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.161
You mean dance with you?

34:00.246 --> 34:01.496
God, I'm not that bad.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.585
You didn't seem to mind it last night.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.170
I wasn't trying to win a contest.

34:08.379 --> 34:09.420
Weren't you?

34:13.926 --> 34:16.178
I'm sorry, but I have a lot of work to do.

34:17.263 --> 34:19.806
The prize for the semifinals is $300.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.976
The grand prize is $5,000.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.313
The winners get to go to America.

34:28.524 --> 34:29.649
I don't have time.

35:37.176 --> 35:38.218
Hi.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.809
This contest,

35:47.228 --> 35:48.562
does it cost money?

35:49.814 --> 35:50.814
No.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.485
You know that it's ballroom dancing.
It's not what I do.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.237
It's Latin ballroom.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.407
If we mix what you do with what I do,
I really think we'd have something.

36:01.367 --> 36:03.243
I still have to teach you everything.

36:03.744 --> 36:04.911
Not everything.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.248
I'll have to teach you a few things, too.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.130
Can we do this?

36:23.764 --> 36:25.891
- What?
- What are you doing?

36:26.058 --> 36:27.267
Just dancing.

36:28.102 --> 36:29.644
But this is a routine.

36:30.104 --> 36:33.607
You can't just do what you feel like
when you feel like it.

36:33.649 --> 36:34.941
When I dance, I have no routine.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.402
But this is a contest. We need a structure.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.778
Can I see that?

36:44.076 --> 36:48.121
First you learn to move,
and then we worry about lists and words.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.289
Okay. Fine.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.083
How do you call this?

36:52.919 --> 36:53.960
Your hips?

36:54.795 --> 36:55.962
Move your hips.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.631
And circle.

36:59.508 --> 37:00.800
Come on.

37:00.843 --> 37:02.093
Come on. And circle.

37:03.596 --> 37:04.638
That's a box.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.391
What, are you crazy?
Why should I cover for you?

37:08.476 --> 37:10.602
You want me to tell them what happened?

37:11.479 --> 37:12.646
Well, hello there.

37:13.522 --> 37:14.522
Mom!

37:14.607 --> 37:15.649
We're just heading over for some lemonade.

37:15.691 --> 37:16.816
Would you care to join us?

37:16.901 --> 37:18.109
No, no.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.320
We'll take a rain check.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.239
Okay. You two have fun.

37:22.990 --> 37:25.242
I'm gonna help Javier,
and you're gonna help me.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.082
Your frame is really weak.

37:35.836 --> 37:36.962
Better?

37:37.129 --> 37:39.256
I could do without the bruises, thanks.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.593
I can fit another couple between us.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.262
It's not gonna be a crowded club.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.890
We've gotta sweep across the dance floor.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.350
Okay.

37:50.434 --> 37:51.893
Okay, I can sweep.

37:54.146 --> 37:56.231
What are you doing? Your steps are too big.

37:56.315 --> 37:57.565
No, I'm sweeping.

37:58.484 --> 37:59.985
How's it going with James?

38:00.069 --> 38:01.361
I got homework to do.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.487
You know what, sweetie?

38:05.449 --> 38:08.952
I've been wanting to ask you
if you have any questions

38:09.704 --> 38:12.163
or concerns, you know,
about you and James.

38:15.209 --> 38:18.461
It's like dancing with
my mother's ironing board.

38:21.674 --> 38:22.882
Just close your eyes.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.093
- Why?
- Just do it.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.397
It's awkward to talk about, but...

38:37.481 --> 38:40.900
It's important that you not
let a boy pressure you.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.904
And even if you have certain feelings
when you're with James,

38:44.989 --> 38:48.491
feelings that you aren't used to having...

38:57.626 --> 38:59.878
Oh, God! Do you have to be such a guy?

39:02.798 --> 39:03.840
Okay.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.593
Okay, I'll be the girl.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.434
The decisions you make now,

39:14.518 --> 39:17.312
the choices you make,
could affect your whole life.

39:19.106 --> 39:20.440
Do you understand what I'm saying?

39:21.776 --> 39:22.776
You do?

40:10.533 --> 40:12.325
I didn't want to waste the music.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.162
Of course not.

40:17.456 --> 40:18.873
What's the problem?

40:19.834 --> 40:21.751
Why are you so afraid to let me lead you?

40:24.171 --> 40:25.255
I'm not.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.507
You are.

40:28.342 --> 40:29.926
When you're ready to say you're afraid,

40:30.886 --> 40:31.970
let me know.

40:40.729 --> 40:42.188
- Hey.
- Sorry.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.648
No, no, no. Stay.

40:44.066 --> 40:45.358
I'm almost done anyway.

40:47.194 --> 40:48.570
So, what did you decide?

40:50.364 --> 40:51.656
I entered the contest.

40:52.491 --> 40:53.700
All right.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.702
Good for you. So how's it going?

40:56.912 --> 40:59.330
Great. It's going great.

41:02.960 --> 41:03.960
Really?

41:04.795 --> 41:06.212
No, it's not.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.800
God, I must have been crazy
to think we could do this.

41:11.510 --> 41:12.719
It's in two weeks,

41:14.138 --> 41:17.307
and whenever he pushes, I pull,

41:17.892 --> 41:22.645
and I'm flowing, and I'm being free,
and I'm making a circle,

41:22.730 --> 41:25.899
and I'm not an ironing board anymore,
and it's still not working.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.736
And now he says, "You're afraid."

41:31.071 --> 41:32.322
Are you?

41:33.073 --> 41:34.115
No.

41:36.118 --> 41:37.243
That's too bad.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.124
Come here.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.876
Un momento. Stand right here.

41:47.254 --> 41:48.379
Let me see your frame.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.090
Good.

41:54.845 --> 41:55.845
A little pressure.

42:02.269 --> 42:03.770
So where'd you learn this?

42:04.522 --> 42:06.314
My parents. They were dancers.

42:07.107 --> 42:08.191
Really?

42:10.903 --> 42:11.903
Relax.

42:12.738 --> 42:13.780
Yes.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.490
Drop your arms.

42:15.950 --> 42:16.950
Breathe.

42:20.079 --> 42:21.329
Now just basic.

42:24.458 --> 42:25.583
Good.

42:28.128 --> 42:30.255
What did you mean when you said,
"That's too bad"?

42:32.341 --> 42:34.551
If you can't move through your fear
and connect with yourself,

42:35.135 --> 42:37.345
there's absolutely no way
you're gonna connect with your partner.

42:39.515 --> 42:40.515
Listen to me.

42:41.267 --> 42:45.812
I know that it's scary as hell
to let another person touch that part of you.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.480
But if you do,

42:48.649 --> 42:49.857
it's worth it.

42:51.151 --> 42:52.986
Now forget everything I just said and dance.

44:02.806 --> 44:04.557
The floor is yours.

44:06.143 --> 44:07.602
I'll see you.

44:19.281 --> 44:20.448
Okay, I am.

44:23.327 --> 44:24.744
You're what?

44:26.580 --> 44:27.580
Afraid.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.835
So, the movement has to be fluid,
like the water.

44:34.755 --> 44:35.755
Afro-Cuban dance,

44:35.881 --> 44:37.590
it's the dance of slaves.

44:38.425 --> 44:41.386
When they danced,
it was their only time to feel free.

44:41.929 --> 44:45.807
So, they could be a bird, you know,

44:47.017 --> 44:50.269
or do a flamenco step
and make fun of their owners.

44:51.605 --> 44:52.939
Or just be in the sea

44:52.981 --> 44:55.358
instead of being stuck on an island
away from home.

44:57.444 --> 44:58.945
It's a dance about being

44:59.029 --> 45:01.155
exactly who you want to be in that moment.

45:06.704 --> 45:09.914
It has to feel and look

45:11.792 --> 45:13.710
as natural as the waves.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.045
Coming.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.048
Going.

45:20.384 --> 45:21.843
Coming.

45:26.515 --> 45:29.809
We were having dinner,
and there was a knock on the door.

45:29.977 --> 45:32.812
Suddenly, two policemen
were taking my father away.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.772
The traitor could have been anyone.

45:35.649 --> 45:37.984
Batista has his spies everywhere.

45:39.111 --> 45:40.611
That's the thing, you know?

45:40.654 --> 45:41.988
My father never hurt anybody.

45:42.489 --> 45:44.532
He was just a free thinker,

45:45.075 --> 45:46.659
but someone didn't like his thoughts.

45:49.663 --> 45:52.665
We had a funeral,
but we never found his body.

45:53.625 --> 45:56.419
Carlos disappeared for a while,
afraid he would be next,

45:56.503 --> 45:58.421
and then, this girl shows up with a baby,

45:58.505 --> 46:00.715
says it's his and she cannot afford it,

46:01.842 --> 46:03.843
and suddenly I'm in charge
of my whole family.

46:05.053 --> 46:06.846
Maybe it's not what you want for yourself,

46:06.889 --> 46:08.514
but you are making a difference.

46:08.557 --> 46:10.975
There's a revolution out there,
and what am I doing?

46:12.269 --> 46:14.520
Just painting stolen cars and babysitting.

46:14.646 --> 46:16.105
No, you're keeping your family alive.

46:16.190 --> 46:18.775
That's the most important thing
you could do.

46:22.696 --> 46:24.572
If we could really win this contest,

46:27.534 --> 46:30.661
maybe I can bring my family
to America with us.

46:38.879 --> 46:41.214
Your parents, they're perfect.

46:43.550 --> 46:45.885
You see how much they want to be
in each other's arms?

46:48.388 --> 46:50.014
For us to dance together,

46:50.307 --> 46:52.058
I mean, really dance,

46:52.142 --> 46:53.893
that's how it has to be.

48:20.022 --> 48:21.898
Don't let us interrupt you.

48:21.982 --> 48:23.566
No. No, we were just...

48:23.650 --> 48:26.068
Yeah, we saw.
Listen, we have more stuff in the alley

48:26.153 --> 48:28.321
if you want to do something useful, Javier.

48:30.657 --> 48:32.325
I should get home.

48:49.384 --> 48:51.302
Thanks for stopping by.

48:52.971 --> 48:54.347
It's half an hour before curfew.

48:55.682 --> 48:57.391
What'd you do, join the circus?

49:00.395 --> 49:02.688
You gonna tell me
you were out with James?

49:03.190 --> 49:04.523
That's what you told your mother.

49:05.859 --> 49:08.194
I never told her what Susie said.

49:09.363 --> 49:10.947
Susie was wrong.

49:13.367 --> 49:14.367
Okay.

49:15.452 --> 49:16.577
Good night, Dad.

49:20.540 --> 49:21.874
Hi.

49:26.171 --> 49:28.464
How long are you gonna be mad at me?

49:34.763 --> 49:35.930
The girls here...

49:36.014 --> 49:37.890
I told Lois that I liked Jane Eyre,

49:37.933 --> 49:39.684
and she asked me what movie she was in.

49:43.814 --> 49:45.815
I'm really sorry that I told on you.

49:47.859 --> 49:49.527
And what I said about Javier.

49:50.070 --> 49:51.445
I was wrong.

49:57.327 --> 49:59.078
You gotta think for yourself, Suze.

49:59.913 --> 50:01.122
I know.

50:01.665 --> 50:02.707
I miss you.

50:11.091 --> 50:13.092
Well, I've been dying to tell you.

50:13.135 --> 50:15.011
Can you keep a secret this time?

53:05.765 --> 53:06.765
No.

53:09.811 --> 53:11.103
Sí, claro.

53:22.407 --> 53:25.826
Susie, your mother and I have
some very disappointing news.

53:26.953 --> 53:28.996
Now, I know how you love to decorate
the Christmas tree

53:29.080 --> 53:30.956
and sing carols and watch home movies,

53:31.041 --> 53:32.917
but I'm afraid tonight,

53:33.627 --> 53:35.211
we're all gonna have to go to the Palace.

53:36.463 --> 53:37.630
All of us?

53:38.131 --> 53:39.465
Yes, Susie, all of us.

53:39.591 --> 53:41.050
I know it's your big night with James,

53:41.134 --> 53:43.969
but you think you could
save your old man one dance?

53:44.304 --> 53:45.930
When did this happen?

53:46.056 --> 53:47.181
Well, you know your father.

53:47.599 --> 53:49.308
Blabs to everyone we were dancers.

53:49.351 --> 53:51.977
So the Phelpses invited us
to the Latin ballroom contest.

53:52.062 --> 53:53.729
Where, I hear, the dancing is
supposed to be pretty good.

53:54.022 --> 53:56.941
But your mother and I'll be
looking out for mistakes.

54:06.284 --> 54:09.328
I can't wait to see
the looks on your parents' faces.

54:09.412 --> 54:10.663
Don't remind me.

54:10.956 --> 54:12.373
I really should be scolding you

54:12.457 --> 54:14.083
for keeping her out till all hours.

54:14.167 --> 54:16.627
Don't worry, ma'am.
We've done nothing you'd disapprove of.

54:16.670 --> 54:18.504
I can promise you that.

54:31.476 --> 54:32.476
Thank you.

54:32.644 --> 54:33.727
Here.

54:33.853 --> 54:35.271
You two make a very cute couple.

54:36.189 --> 54:37.815
So many of the girls coming over

54:37.857 --> 54:39.233
from the States these days

54:39.317 --> 54:41.443
get a little, you know, wild.

54:42.279 --> 54:44.238
You're lucky to have such lovely daughters.

54:45.115 --> 54:47.283
Ladies and gentlemen, merry Christmas!

54:47.409 --> 54:48.659
Injust a few moments,

54:48.702 --> 54:51.203
we'll begin this evening's special event.

54:51.246 --> 54:54.081
So, when do we get to see
the championship dancers?

54:54.207 --> 54:55.874
We're hardly champions.

54:56.042 --> 54:58.377
You're just being modest.

54:58.586 --> 55:01.171
Come on. I've never seen you guys
dance in public before.

55:03.091 --> 55:05.634
Actually, I thought if your husband
didn't mind, you and I might...

55:07.762 --> 55:09.013
James.

55:09.264 --> 55:11.557
Maybe Katey would like to dance.

55:12.892 --> 55:14.810
Would you like to dance?

55:16.146 --> 55:18.147
I have to find a ladies' room.

55:18.231 --> 55:19.481
I'll escort you.

55:19.649 --> 55:20.858
No, no, I'm fine.

55:31.745 --> 55:33.245
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry. I was...

55:33.330 --> 55:34.788
This is a crazy idea.

55:35.081 --> 55:36.832
No. We're gonna win.

55:41.755 --> 55:44.089
This is the moment
you have all been waiting for,

55:44.132 --> 55:46.633
the Latin ballroom competition!

55:47.093 --> 55:48.927
Three talented couples will be chosen

55:48.970 --> 55:51.430
to compete in the finals on New Year's Eve.

55:51.473 --> 55:53.182
- Qué bonita.
- Gracias.

55:53.558 --> 55:54.767
Señoritas y señores,

55:54.809 --> 55:57.686
presenting the brightest star
of the Havana night,

55:57.771 --> 56:00.064
Lola Martinez!

56:07.655 --> 56:09.281
Where's Katey?

56:10.158 --> 56:11.492
Just wait.

56:16.790 --> 56:17.998
Oh, my God!

56:21.669 --> 56:24.213
Funny thing is
when I look into your eyes

56:24.381 --> 56:26.924
I sense something
so sincere in your disguise

56:27.300 --> 56:29.760
You whisper secrets
I hear only in my dreams

56:29.969 --> 56:32.846
Then I wake up
to your tele-smoke screen

56:32.931 --> 56:35.724
I wait patiently
while you play your game

56:35.809 --> 56:37.184
'Cause in the end

56:37.268 --> 56:39.019
I'll be the winner all the same

56:39.104 --> 56:41.647
You'll see clearly
when the song comes to a stop

56:41.856 --> 56:44.400
I'll be the one
blowing kisses from the top

56:44.484 --> 56:46.777
So, baby, stop
You're surrounded

56:47.404 --> 56:49.655
I got my love all around ya

56:50.448 --> 56:52.741
- One wrong move...
- Move and I'll drown ya

56:52.951 --> 56:55.619
And that'll end ya
You should surrender

56:55.829 --> 56:58.205
You'll never win
unless you give in

56:58.289 --> 57:01.625
- So baby, stop
- Stop, you're surrounded

57:01.668 --> 57:04.294
- I got my love
- Love all around ya

57:04.838 --> 57:07.172
- One wrong move
- Move and I'll drown ya

57:07.257 --> 57:10.050
And that'll end ya
You should surrender

57:10.176 --> 57:12.344
You'll never win
unless you give in

57:12.429 --> 57:14.721
So won't you give
our love a chance?

57:14.931 --> 57:17.182
Or do you
only wanna dance?

57:19.352 --> 57:21.937
You put your lips
very closely to my face

57:22.021 --> 57:24.857
And then you run away
And so begins the chase

57:25.191 --> 57:27.651
I'll be the hunter
But, boy, you better pray

57:27.694 --> 57:30.904
'Cause when I want ya
I'll get you anyway

57:31.030 --> 57:33.866
You know what I wanna do
It ain't anything new

57:34.409 --> 57:37.786
I'm tired of dropping clues
So when I step to you

57:37.871 --> 57:39.663
Will you rise
to my occasion?

57:39.706 --> 57:42.624
Or will you make me
change your station?

57:42.709 --> 57:45.252
Stop, you're surrounded

57:45.336 --> 57:47.421
- I got my love
- Love all around ya

57:47.505 --> 57:50.340
- One wrong move
- Move and I'll drown ya

57:50.383 --> 57:53.510
And that'll end ya
You should surrender

57:53.553 --> 57:55.804
You'll never win
unless you give in

57:55.889 --> 57:59.224
- So stop
- Stop, you're surrounded

57:59.392 --> 58:01.643
- I got my love
- Love all around ya

58:01.728 --> 58:04.563
- One wrong move
- Move and I'll drown ya

58:04.981 --> 58:07.900
And that'll end ya
You should surrender

58:07.942 --> 58:10.110
You'll never win
unless you give in

58:10.195 --> 58:12.571
So won't you give
our love a chance?

58:13.406 --> 58:15.199
If you take my hands

58:15.241 --> 58:17.910
And follow my lead
I'll make you dance

58:17.994 --> 58:19.411
I can make you dance

58:19.496 --> 58:21.747
But if you get my feet
and miss the beat

58:21.831 --> 58:23.874
Then I can't take
that chance

58:23.917 --> 58:25.167
I can't take that chance

58:25.376 --> 58:27.711
If you take my hands
and follow my lead

58:27.837 --> 58:30.672
- I'll make you dance
- I can make you dance

58:30.757 --> 58:32.925
But if you get my feet
and miss the beat

58:32.967 --> 58:35.219
Then I can't take
that chance

58:35.261 --> 58:36.261
I can't take it

58:36.387 --> 58:38.931
- Stop
- Stop, you're surrounded

58:39.432 --> 58:42.100
- I got my love
- Love all around ya

58:42.352 --> 58:44.853
- One wrong move
- Move and I'll drown ya

58:45.021 --> 58:47.981
- So, stop
- Stop, you're surrounded

58:48.107 --> 58:50.901
- I got my love
- Love all around ya

58:50.944 --> 58:53.820
- One wrong move
- Move and I'll drown ya

58:54.197 --> 58:56.949
And that'll end ya
You should surrender

58:57.283 --> 58:59.409
You'll never win
unless you give in

58:59.786 --> 59:01.578
So won't you give
our love a chance?

59:24.185 --> 59:25.561
Ladies and gentlemen,

59:25.770 --> 59:28.313
the judges have chosen
our three finalist couples

59:28.356 --> 59:29.606
for next week.

59:29.649 --> 59:31.817
And they are

59:31.943 --> 59:37.489
couple number five,
Jose Velarde and Iris Mesa!

59:39.367 --> 59:41.493
Couple number nine,

59:42.287 --> 59:45.247
Tino and Lourdes Martel!

59:48.293 --> 59:49.459
And,

59:50.003 --> 59:51.670
couple number two,

59:52.880 --> 59:56.675
Javier Suarez and Katey Miller!

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.646
What could we have possibly done

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.648
to make you want to hurt us so much?

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.567
You humiliate us in front of everyone,

01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:15.319
including your father's boss.

01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:16.903
What, did you figure that he'd lose his job...

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:18.530
- No one's losing their job.
...and we'd have to go back?

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.116
- You're going to lose your job?
- No. Please, go to bed.

01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:22.784
I didn't do anything.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.120
- You lied to us.
- I know, and I'm sorry,

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.080
but I knew you wouldn't let me try...

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:28.874
Kiss a Cuban pool boy in front of everyone?

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.667
You're damn straight we wouldn't.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.252
And why in the world
would you wanna hurt James?

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.004
I thought you liked him.

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:36.298
No, you liked him.

01:00:36.382 --> 01:00:39.551
Because he fits into your
perfect country club world.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.386
There's nothing wrong with that world.

01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:43.388
No, but he couldn't keep his hands off me.

01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:45.223
What? What happened?

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:47.726
Nothing happened. I'm fine.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:48.769
Why didn't you tell us?

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:51.647
Because I didn't want to mess up your job.

01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:54.274
Katey,

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:57.110
how could you think that my job
would be more important than you?

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:01.615
I didn't want to hurt you.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.410
I just wanted to help Javier,

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:06.995
which is his name, by the way.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:12.125
Oh, God, I love dancing with him.

01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:15.003
Oh, Katey.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.301
Did it ever occur to you that
that boy might be using you?

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:24.221
A nice American girl
who can be his ticket out of here.

01:01:24.263 --> 01:01:25.764
- That's not true.
- You may love dancing with that boy,

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.349
but there are more important factors here,

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:28.517
like your family and your future!

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:31.103
Why does it have to be either-or?
Just because you gave up your passion,

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.646
why should I?

01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:46.660
Katey.

01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:48.120
Katey, wait.

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:50.288
- Honey, wait!
- I'm going to Javier's.

01:01:50.456 --> 01:01:51.957
Your mother's just trying to protect you.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.583
I'm gonna be out there on New Year's Eve,

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:55.627
no matter what you and Mom think.

01:01:56.337 --> 01:01:57.796
No more lies.

01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:05.470
He's out celebrating,

01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:09.474
so if you want to wait for him...

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.982
That was Katey.

01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:21.903
It's okay. She's with his mother.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.655
Was I wrong?

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:25.657
No.

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:28.243
But neither was Katey.

01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:32.080
Sometimes I wish we...

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.793
Just try to imagine what it would be like
if we hadn't had...

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:42.924
Does it make me a bad mother?

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.509
Of course not.

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:49.181
You were good.

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:51.016
It's okay to miss it.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.188
They sure spiced up
our old routine, didn't they?

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:57.522
I'll say.

01:02:57.857 --> 01:02:59.858
That wouldn't have gone over too well
at Roseland, would it?

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:00.942
No.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.823
Bert, she's not a little girl anymore.

01:03:27.845 --> 01:03:29.638
What are you reading?

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.975
José Martí.

01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:36.853
It was my father's.

01:03:37.438 --> 01:03:39.022
We got rid of all his books

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:40.982
just to be safe, but

01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:42.734
I kept this one.

01:03:44.403 --> 01:03:45.570
Hello.

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:47.531
- Javier?
- Yeah?

01:03:49.742 --> 01:03:51.243
If we don't win the finals...

01:03:51.285 --> 01:03:52.536
We will.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.788
But if we don't,

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.834
I'm not gonna go to college in six months.

01:04:03.881 --> 01:04:06.550
You don't know how
you're gonna feel in six months.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.427
Yes, I do.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:12.764
No, you don't.

01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:16.643
I don't want you to give up
your dreams for me.

01:04:16.769 --> 01:04:18.436
But I have new dreams now.

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:05.358
Susie, why don't you and I
go raid that buffet by the pool?

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:06.943
Sure.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:20.957
Tree looks nice.

01:05:27.673 --> 01:05:30.008
Your father and I discussed it.

01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:35.889
And we think that you should do a

01:05:36.682 --> 01:05:38.391
double turn at the finals.

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:43.688
You like the way I danced?

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.358
Katey.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:50.528
If you're asking me to approve
of you and this boy, I can't.

01:05:52.823 --> 01:05:54.324
But the dancing...

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.745
The dancing was incredible.

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.834
I think I should take a little credit for that.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.712
I think you should, too.

01:06:24.605 --> 01:06:26.439
Javier, these are my parents.

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:28.233
Hi, Javier. It's nice to meet you.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:31.861
Nice to meet you, too. It's an honor
to meet such wonderful dancers.

01:06:32.196 --> 01:06:34.239
This is from my mother's garden.

01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:36.992
Thank you. That was sweet of you.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:39.369
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.745
- Ready?
- Happy New Year,

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:42.163
- ladies and gentlemen.
- Yeah.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.582
Tonight we bring you
the three winning couples

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.168
from the Latin ballroom competition.

01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:07.564
Do you wanna dance?

01:07:19.618 --> 01:07:20.910
Don't you dare!

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:51.149
Feliz Año Nuevo, ladies and gentlemen.

01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:56.362
Welcome to our Latin ballroom
amateur dance contest final.

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:04.913
You will dance on the stage
one couple at a time.

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:09.375
Tonight's winning couple will win $5,000.

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.294
You are up first.

01:08:12.379 --> 01:08:14.297
Our first couple this evening

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:18.343
is Mr. Jose Velarde and Miss Iris Mesa!

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.294
Don't forget to look at the judges.

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:55.171
Don't worry about the others.

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:58.383
Remember, you're the queen
of La Rosa Negra.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.720
Our final contestants this evening,

01:09:02.763 --> 01:09:06.140
Miss Katey Miller and Mr. Javier Suarez.

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:18.254
He's got a gun!

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:30.391
Go! I'll find you!

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:31.406
Attention, all hotel guests.

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:34.325
President Batista has fled the country.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.202
There is no immediate danger.

01:13:36.286 --> 01:13:39.664
Please contact the front desk
for further information.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:07.984
I can't believe it's real.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:10.445
Don't you wanna be out there celebrating?

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:13.698
No. I wanna be right here with you.

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:23.684
We didn't win the contest.

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:25.269
No.

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:29.148
But the consolation prize was pretty good.

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:40.660
I'm so happy I can see all this with you.

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:50.086
What?

01:15:51.296 --> 01:15:52.547
Nothing.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:54.799
Tell me.

01:15:57.803 --> 01:15:59.095
Carlos,

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:03.057
he always said that
when the revolution came,

01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:06.102
Castro will kick out
all the Yankee companies.

01:16:08.855 --> 01:16:11.107
But you don't really know that.

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:14.151
No. I'm just saying that...

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.654
What, that I might have to leave?

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:18.531
It could happen.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:20.992
But they wouldn't do that,

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:24.495
not if the whole idea is
to give people their freedom.

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:26.205
Cuban people.

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:30.668
Well, then you'll come with us.

01:16:30.877 --> 01:16:32.211
I'm sure my dad can work it out.

01:16:33.213 --> 01:16:34.338
And my family?

01:16:34.506 --> 01:16:36.841
We'll send for them,
just like we were always gonna do.

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:39.051
Katey, I wanted to leave because of Batista,

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:41.178
- but now...
- But you don't know

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:43.931
what life will be like here.
I mean, what if it doesn't get better?

01:16:46.059 --> 01:16:47.977
My father died for this.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:50.021
I have to believe it will.

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.899
I can make a difference here.

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:55.776
You showed me that.

01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:00.656
This is my country. It's my home.

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:10.499
Oh, thank God.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.460
Katey, are you okay?

01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:16.047
We're leaving?

01:17:16.381 --> 01:17:18.633
Yeah. Your father's making arrangements.

01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:39.862
Give me that comb.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.492
When you were little,
you used to hide under the bed

01:17:44.576 --> 01:17:47.244
when I'd try to comb out these knots.

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:56.796
Katey, your father's
been the only man in my life,

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.799
so I don't know what it's like
to say goodbye to someone.

01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:02.635
Saying goodbye to dancing,

01:18:02.719 --> 01:18:04.804
the other love of my life,

01:18:08.558 --> 01:18:09.767
it broke my heart.

01:18:15.899 --> 01:18:18.025
Then you were born, and then Susie,

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:20.194
and I loved you both so much that I...

01:18:20.278 --> 01:18:21.404
You're saying I'll get over it.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.280
No, I'm not.

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:27.952
No. I'm saying I know you're hurting.

01:18:29.329 --> 01:18:31.247
Everything's such a mess.

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:35.418
You have a choice.

01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:37.628
You can do nothing,

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:39.964
you can hide under the bed.

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:43.634
Or you can work through the knots.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.743
I'm gonna miss you.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.040
I'm gonna miss you, too.

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:19.003
I am taking you with me.

01:19:19.796 --> 01:19:21.839
I am keeping you here.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.711
Javier once said that
dancing is about being

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:02.963
exactly who you wanna be in that moment.

01:20:03.423 --> 01:20:05.549
Dancing with him, I realized

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:08.677
I was becoming
exactly the woman I wanted to be.

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:10.554
We didn't win the contest,

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.015
but we did win something
more important to us.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:14.975
On my last night in Havana,

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:17.895
we were king and queen of La Rosa Negra.

01:20:18.021 --> 01:20:22.483
Hips start shakin'
and movin' all around

01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:24.902
Get them hips
shakin' around

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.738
Let's dirty dance right here
on the floor, girl

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:29.907
Let's do our thing
Let's give 'em a show, girl

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:32.243
But I don't know
Don't think they're ready for this

01:20:32.285 --> 01:20:34.286
Let's give it to 'em
I hope they're ready for this

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:35.621
You put your hands on my hips

01:20:35.705 --> 01:20:36.872
I put my hand on your hips

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:39.500
- Baby, I'll follow your lead
- Check it, it goes like this

01:20:41.044 --> 01:20:42.294
Baby, just follow the motion

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:43.504
Dancing is sexual motion

01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:44.797
Moving with so much emotion

01:20:44.881 --> 01:20:45.923
We gettin' dirty now

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:49.969

- It's how we dance

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:52.471
Yeah, yeah, just dirty dancin'

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:55.099

01:20:55.141 --> 01:20:56.809
Sexual dancin'

01:20:57.352 --> 01:20:59.687
- Dirty, dirty dancin'

01:20:59.771 --> 01:21:01.856

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.149

01:21:06.611 --> 01:21:08.362
Dirty, dirty, dirty...

Shake it, shake it, shake it, gonna shake it

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:22.543
We didn't know when we would see
each other again,

01:21:22.627 --> 01:21:25.629
but we knew that this wasn't our last dance.

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:27.590
Let's go!

01:21:28.305 --> 01:21:34.939
