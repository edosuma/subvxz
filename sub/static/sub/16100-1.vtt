00:59.768 --> 01:03.103
Sometimes when I'm at
school, people are mean to me,

01:03.188 --> 01:07.900
and I listened to her music and
it was like a light just lit up in me.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.987
We all just want
to try and blend in and be normal,

01:12.238 --> 01:15.824
but Katy tells us
that it's okay to stand out.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.453
You made me think
that being weird is okay.

01:20.330 --> 01:24.333
That it's okay to be different and
unique. It's okay to express yourself.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.712
Have fun in life.
You can never take it too seriously.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.506
It's just impossible.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.258
Her lyrics have inspired me.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.360
They've helped me keep on going
when I thought that I couldn't.

01:35.845 --> 01:39.598
I have a dream in life,
and she had a dream,

01:39.682 --> 01:40.682
and she made it happen.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.727
I want to do something with my life.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.104
I want to stand out like a sore thumb.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.064
I don't want to just be
like everybody else.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.315
I want...

01:49.275 --> 01:54.113
I want to be a leader, but then there's
all those responsibilities.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.069
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah, you can fire it.

02:17.153 --> 02:19.138
Will you hold that, please?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.141
You can just stand...

02:22.517 --> 02:24.101
- Is it on?
- Yeah, it is now.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.607
- Hey, Sue...
- Hey.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.693
They were asking
if the girls might be

02:32.777 --> 02:34.695
able to wear the gold dresses

02:34.779 --> 02:36.530
for Kissed A Girl
for this next run-through?

02:36.614 --> 02:38.031
- Will they be ready by then?
- Of course.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.034
How much work needs to be done on
her clothes before we're ready to dress?

02:41.369 --> 02:42.452
About 15 more minutes.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.996
- 15 minutes?
- Half hour.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.415
Yesterday was our first fitting.
That's why

02:46.499 --> 02:48.250
we're in Project Runway mode
right now.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.336
So we'll do the thing like
Sue said. That'll bring it up.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.422
O.M.G.

02:55.466 --> 02:58.093
We don't normally put
a big arena tour together

02:58.178 --> 02:59.845
with only one week of rehearsal, but

02:59.929 --> 03:01.555
I thought we'd
present you guys with a challenge.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.515
But it's also important
to have fun, so...

03:03.933 --> 03:05.142
Let's have fun out there as well.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.604
She loves challenging us,
that Katheryn Perry.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.859
Will you come up onstage
with them spinning?

03:13.943 --> 03:15.485
I don't know.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.237
- Yeah, probably.
- You might as well.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.823
It's a big, big deal for her.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.367
She's not done any kind
of tour like this.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.954
I don't want you to approach
every single number the same.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.414
I want you to approach
them all differently.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.749
Like when you see Katy in rehearsal,

03:28.833 --> 03:31.126
do you see what a persona
she puts on for every number?

03:32.086 --> 03:33.921
Tilt back. There you go.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.883
I got an ass like Nicki Minaj
in this one.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.179
The vision for the tour...

03:42.263 --> 03:44.973
It's a little bit of
Alice in Wonderland,

03:45.058 --> 03:46.767
it's Dorothy in Oz.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.727
She wants the fans to experience

03:48.811 --> 03:52.022
that fantastical world
that she dreamed up.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.025
How could you ever be too cartoony?

03:55.193 --> 03:58.237
I feel a real connection to fairy tales.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.198
And I think that
in some ways, I live in a fairy tale.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.116
Ready? Five, six, seven, eight.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.966
"California Gurls" right here!

05:43.051 --> 05:44.134
California!

05:44.218 --> 05:47.679
We are Katy Perry fans
and we don't care how old we are!

05:49.098 --> 05:53.060
What up? If you're a Katy Perry
fan, make some noise right now!

05:54.562 --> 05:56.521
I love Katy Perry!

05:56.773 --> 05:59.733
One more. Okay. We're not done.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.402
We are done. I gotta start.

06:02.904 --> 06:03.945
High five.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.656
- It's all happening.
- Tour's starting.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.004
Very excited.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.925
There are 14,000 people out there.
All right.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.146
Let's go, baby. Let's do this.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.273
She'll be there in four minutes.

06:52.703 --> 06:53.745
Don't be nervous.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.498
- I'm nervous. I'm nervous.
- You're gonna kill it.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.464
Ready? Everyone?

07:05.842 --> 07:08.343
- Circle. Circle!
- Circle the drain.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.512
- Circle the drain.
- Circle!

07:11.180 --> 07:12.514
Everyone!

07:12.849 --> 07:15.016
Everyone! Russ!

07:15.685 --> 07:18.019
I'm coming in the circle. I'm coming in.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.524
On three! One, two, three!

07:22.650 --> 07:25.152
California Dreams Tour!

07:28.573 --> 07:31.700
Since I was nine,
my dream has always been the same.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.954
To be onstage, in a glittering costume,

07:36.038 --> 07:38.874
and to hear
thousands of people sing along with me.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.296
This moment is my
childhood dream come true.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.048
All right, everybody, here we go.
Stand by.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.619
Sing!

09:50.423 --> 09:54.134
My goal, when I'm playing
shows, is super simple.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.886
It's just to make people smile,

09:56.971 --> 10:03.560
and to enjoy themselves. To have a
heart full of hope and happiness.

10:03.644 --> 10:08.440
And to leave that show with
just a shimmer in their eyes.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.366
- It's kind of like...
- Shocked.

10:18.451 --> 10:22.203
Being shot with an arrow
of Katy Perry-ness.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.039
So much excitement!

10:28.711 --> 10:30.045
- Hi!
- Hi!

10:31.631 --> 10:33.256
- You look fabulous.
- Thank you.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.176
Hello!

10:36.260 --> 10:37.469
- I'm Katy.
- I'm Heather.

10:37.553 --> 10:38.511
Nice to meet you.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.679
- Magda. Nice to meet you.
- Magda?

10:40.222 --> 10:41.348
- Yeah.
- And this is?

10:41.432 --> 10:42.557
Maya and Eli.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.893
Oh, my goodness.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.228
- Maya and Eli?
- Yeah.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.521
Do they move a lot?

10:51.734 --> 10:53.401
There's something in your belly!

10:53.903 --> 10:54.986
Wow!

10:55.071 --> 10:56.196
That's my daughter.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.281
That is so crazy.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.992
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you so much.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.702
Oh, my God.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.913
- My name isn't really...
- Oh, okay.

11:05.581 --> 11:10.669
This thing blew up in a way
that none of us expected.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.087
Hello. I'm Katy.

11:13.255 --> 11:16.883
I've been listening to her
ever since I first heard her, years ago.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.302
And she married Russell Brand.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.096
And he's the coolest ever.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.141
She's like this real girl who became

11:25.226 --> 11:28.645
this huge pop star.
And now, she's on top of the world.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.314
I've never been on the freeway with him!

11:31.857 --> 11:34.109
So, everyone on the tour
is very excited.

11:36.946 --> 11:40.365
We have seven tour buses
and 16 trucks on the road.

11:40.449 --> 11:43.535
This tour is so mammoth

11:43.619 --> 11:45.036
compared to where we started off.

11:46.664 --> 11:50.041
There's a lot of
nervous energy, like, "Can we do this?"

11:50.126 --> 11:53.169
Can Katy survive a two-hour show

11:53.254 --> 11:56.840
every night for a year?
She's not done that before.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.139
I want a hot dog.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.225
But, still, I'll eat these instead.

12:09.645 --> 12:10.645
Hey!

12:10.980 --> 12:12.814
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.316
I met Katy, like, ten years ago.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.445
We became friends first,
then, she was like...

12:18.529 --> 12:21.489
"You work in fashion?
I work in music. Can I borrow a dress?"

12:26.787 --> 12:27.954
You ready?

12:43.637 --> 12:46.139
When I first started styling,
I had no pull. I had nothing.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.433
I was just a new guy.
Like, who's Johnny Wujek?

12:48.642 --> 12:49.742
And Katy's like, "We're using him."

12:49.827 --> 12:50.894
Hey, everybody.

12:51.896 --> 12:56.024
Our friendship built
as our working career built together.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.817
She knows my family, I know her family.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.194
We've got each other's backs.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.466
I get to work with Katy
creatively on her looks for her tour,

13:21.550 --> 13:23.551
videos, red carpets.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.471
She's got so many looks that she can
pull off, which is so fun for us

13:26.555 --> 13:28.056
because anything is possible.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.497
I was hired to do her makeup

13:52.581 --> 13:55.083
for an event that she was performing at.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.336
This is back when nobody knew
who she was.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.214
Literally like a month later,
I Kissed A Girl went big,

14:01.298 --> 14:03.633
and she took the chance on me

14:03.717 --> 14:06.010
and just like plucked me out of
obscurity from a makeup counter,

14:06.095 --> 14:07.846
which was, like, amazing dream.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.932
I put my two weeks' notice
in very quickly.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.392
And... Well, I'm still working with her.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.521
Tamra is Katy's assistant on tour.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.398
Tamra! Tamra!

14:20.109 --> 14:23.778
She keeps Katy moving,
she keeps Katy eating.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.613
She tries to wake Katy up.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.494
This is the first tour
I've ever been on with someone.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.872
It's my first job in the music industry.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.000
She just wants to have fun all the
time, which is awesome.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.502
She's not much of a morning person.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.629
It's like working with a friend.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.560
I met her when she was 19.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.813
She did cartwheels
the first time she came into my office.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.816
You know, landed in the splits.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.694
I kind of feel
like an older brother sometimes.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.989
I'm very protective,
and I hate to see her unhappy.

15:08.365 --> 15:12.785
Katy's sister, Angela,
she's a legit big sister.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.203
Ange, can she bring her...

15:14.288 --> 15:15.914
She has a job on tour.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.541
I take care of all of
the meet-and-greets,

15:17.542 --> 15:19.083
people who come to the show.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.168
I like your earrings.

15:20.252 --> 15:24.255
We always kind of had
this deal that when she made it big,

15:24.340 --> 15:25.423
that I was gonna work with her,

15:25.507 --> 15:26.758
and we were gonna be together.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.384
Oh, my God!

15:29.720 --> 15:30.720
Katy!

15:46.654 --> 15:47.654
Sing!

15:49.156 --> 15:51.324
Me? Change again?

15:51.825 --> 15:52.825
Really?

15:54.703 --> 15:55.703
Okay.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.852
- Katy! Hey!
- Grandma!

17:01.228 --> 17:02.562
Oh, you look beautiful!

17:02.646 --> 17:05.147
Thank you. You look gorgeous, too.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.108
I love purple on you.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.359
- Do ya?
- Yeah. It's my favorite color.

17:09.444 --> 17:10.694
Shall I shut this?

17:10.779 --> 17:12.488
- No, that's okay.
- Okay.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.115
You look so pretty.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.117
Thank you. I just thought...

17:16.201 --> 17:20.329
If you didn't live in Vegas then I would
probably wear something more casual.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.499
But since you live in Vegas,
I decided to dress up.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.042
Oh. Okay.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.127
I have a gift I want to give you.

17:27.253 --> 17:28.796
- All right.
- If you want it.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.131
I want it.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.676
This is an official tourjacket.
Make sure it fits.

17:34.970 --> 17:35.970
It's pretty.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.056
It's nice. It's like satin.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.515
Wait, hold on. One second.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.059
Hold on. Grandma, calm down.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.813
This is a medium,
but this fits you perfect then, huh?

17:46.148 --> 17:47.490
It fits in the shoulders and everything.

17:47.574 --> 17:49.108
Yeah. Can you go like this?

17:50.152 --> 17:51.235
And it's fine?

17:51.320 --> 17:52.904
You don't want the small, do you?

17:52.988 --> 17:53.988
No.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.033
So, what was Katy like as a kid?

17:57.743 --> 17:58.951
A showoff.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.828
I'm a showoff. I know that.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.205
I know it. Attention getter.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.624
But it's got me somewhere. This is me.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.542
Acting silly, as usual.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.838
- Oh, no. This isn't a cute picture.
- Oh, Kate. Woe is me.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.342
This is me at, like, 17 or 18.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.803
There you are again. Rolling your eyes.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.765
I remember I went one time to babysit,

18:20.849 --> 18:24.227
and I had to keep 'em
the weekend and it was awful.

18:24.812 --> 18:25.853
What?

18:26.355 --> 18:27.396
Grandma!

18:27.940 --> 18:31.400
- Their parents traveled an awful lot...
- Yeah.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.693
To preach somewhere.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.654
And we turned out okay.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.114
- Yes.
- Kind of.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.866
As far as I know.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.623
And, Edgar, are you receiving?

18:46.875 --> 18:47.959
Are you tuned?

18:48.544 --> 18:50.711
I tell you what, today,
I mean, I was up in the mountains,

18:50.796 --> 18:52.630
and I was crying out in my spirit

18:52.714 --> 18:53.840
"Oh, God, let me hear it.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.842
"Oh, God, let me hear it."

18:55.926 --> 18:57.552
Amen.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.762
Being a kid in my household

18:59.847 --> 19:04.308
consisted of
going to a lot of church activities,

19:04.393 --> 19:07.270
and hanging out
with a lot of church kids.

19:07.729 --> 19:12.733
And anything that
had to do with God was A-okay.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.486
Come on, raise your hand.
If you're a born-again child of God,

19:15.571 --> 19:17.530
you have Jesus Christ
as the Lord of your life,

19:17.614 --> 19:19.740
you are the sheep,
and he is the shepherd.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.577
My upbringing
was Pentecostal Christianity.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.829
We were slain in the Spirit, you know,

19:24.913 --> 19:26.347
if you put your hand
on there, they go down.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.919
The presence of God
in my life was absolute.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.422
Our parents were traveling ministers

19:34.506 --> 19:35.840
for many years and still are.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.842
And so we would travel with them a lot.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.678
Almost every year,
every two years we'd move.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.097
It was always
a new environment, a new school.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.892
Say "hi," Katy. Say "I'm gonna win."

19:46.977 --> 19:48.936
- Say it.
- Dad!

19:49.021 --> 19:51.480
Say "I'm gonna
win the book-reading contest."

19:51.690 --> 19:53.524
I'm gonna win the book-reading contest.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.568
I got 440 books.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.111
Great.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.404
Praise the Lord.

19:58.488 --> 20:03.284
We were so engulfed in
100 % Pentecostal Christianity.

20:04.286 --> 20:08.664
I had no idea that other people weren't
like how our family was.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.042
We weren't allowed
to eat Lucky Charms

20:11.126 --> 20:13.211
because luck is of Lucifer.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.796
I couldn't watch The Smurfs growing up.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.716
I didn't know who Michael Jackson
was until I was, like, 14.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.178
The Wizard of Oz,
Alice in Wonderland, all banned.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.347
I think SisterAct 2

20:24.431 --> 20:26.641
was the only movie
that she was allowed to see.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.602
Not SisterAct 1, and I don't know why.

20:29.686 --> 20:30.811
You'd have to ask her parents.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.481
Of course, every parent
wants the best for their children.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.567
And I guess we just
sort of put barriers up.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.569
We didn't want
to get 'em involved in things

20:38.654 --> 20:40.238
that would get 'em, you know,

20:40.322 --> 20:42.073
hurt 'em in their early years.

21:01.718 --> 21:07.056
When I was five, the guy that
was preaching at the revivals,

21:07.140 --> 21:09.267
he came up to me out of, you know,

21:09.351 --> 21:11.185
a few thousand people and said,

21:12.062 --> 21:13.187
"You're gonna sing."

21:33.917 --> 21:35.293
You know, I'd have these little ditties

21:35.377 --> 21:36.919
that would go round and round
in my head.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.629
Singing in the shower,

21:38.714 --> 21:41.424
or just singing as I was walking
along the streets of Santa Barbara.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.969
So, I asked for a guitar at 13
for my birthday.

21:45.053 --> 21:48.139
And that's when I really started
writing songs.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.815
I did a gospel record when I was 15.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.984
For her to be making a Christian record

22:00.068 --> 22:03.279
was basically her becoming
Michael Jackson in our family.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.325
To me, that was becoming successful.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.578
But it was really
tough because the only kind of music

22:10.662 --> 22:13.164
that I was allowed
to listen to was Christian music.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.797
One day I was at a friend's house,

22:21.882 --> 22:24.925
and she played
You Oughta Know byAlanis Morissette.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.094
And I was, like, "Wow."

22:27.637 --> 22:30.056
She just kinda let all of her

22:30.140 --> 22:32.308
thoughts and emotions come out.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.852
Didn't care what anyone else thought,

22:34.936 --> 22:37.772
she just did it completely honestly.

22:47.949 --> 22:50.034
Because of that,
I just started singing about

22:50.118 --> 22:53.329
everything I was
going through as a young woman.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.832
I think it took a little bit of time
for my parents to adjust

22:56.917 --> 22:58.417
when I stopped singing gospel.

23:00.921 --> 23:04.006
Next question, though, what happens
when your daughter is on MTV?

23:04.383 --> 23:05.424
I don't watch it.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.009
- You wouldn't watch me, Mom?
- No.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.430
Right.

23:11.765 --> 23:12.765
Oh you would Mary.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.309
Katy, I'm not gonna
watch if you got half your clothes off.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.895
She ain't gonna have
half her clothes off. Relax.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.273
Do we have to have that
on a documentary?

23:21.358 --> 23:23.567
- Controversial.
- I wouldn't bet on it.

23:24.778 --> 23:28.656
I feel like I was never
allowed to even think for myself.

23:29.157 --> 23:32.118
And having
any kind of feminist live-on-your-own,

23:32.202 --> 23:34.954
independent spirit is just of the devil.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.415
And I, all of a sudden,

23:37.499 --> 23:40.584
my heart wants to do
all kinds of things.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.628
I wanna travel
and experience other things

23:42.712 --> 23:44.839
outside of my comfort zone.

23:45.424 --> 23:49.009
I guess I'm just probably going through
a rebel phase. I don't know.

23:50.345 --> 23:53.764
So, she moved to LA.
And I was a little bit scared for her

23:53.849 --> 23:56.183
because to me, back then, you know,

23:56.268 --> 23:59.437
LA was a huge, scary, big city.

24:01.356 --> 24:03.566
I feel like I'm a new person.

24:03.650 --> 24:08.404
And especially being,
you know, kind of on my own.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.698
She was experiencing
everything for the first time.

24:10.824 --> 24:14.910
Her first club, her first
encounter with gay people.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.787
It was always something new,

24:16.872 --> 24:18.831
and it came through in her music.

24:19.374 --> 24:22.668
I'm out living life
for the first time, so it's exciting.

24:48.403 --> 24:51.405
I'm Mark Hunter.
I'm known as a nightlife photographer,

24:51.490 --> 24:55.868
I'm out capturing people,
and I started seeing Katy coming out.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.162
She made you feel happy.

24:58.246 --> 25:01.790
There was just like a unique charisma
that you don't see that much.

25:24.731 --> 25:25.940
Come on!

25:26.024 --> 25:28.317
When I first met Katy, I would see her

25:28.401 --> 25:30.402
and I'd be like, "Who is that person?

25:30.487 --> 25:32.404
"This girl is completely mental

25:32.614 --> 25:35.783
"and completely
opposite from me in all the right ways."

25:37.410 --> 25:39.370
We actually met at a Daft Punk concert.

25:39.579 --> 25:43.374
She had on a blue or pink wig,

25:43.458 --> 25:45.709
and was dressed like a robot.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.461
So she's basically the same.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.713
Years ago, we went to a concert.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.924
We laid on the grass
and promised ourselves

25:52.008 --> 25:54.927
that we were gonna do
amazing things with our lives.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.304
"I'm gonna do this,
and it's gonna happen."

25:57.389 --> 26:00.432
And I was, like, "Me too. And I swear to
God, I'll never let you give up."

26:01.476 --> 26:02.643
She's my best friend.

26:16.658 --> 26:20.077
So you board
a private plane in Austria at midnight

26:20.287 --> 26:23.038
arrive in LA at 4:00 a.m.,

26:23.123 --> 26:25.833
pick up Russell, noon takeoff,

26:25.917 --> 26:27.960
or as late as Katy prefers.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.254
And travel 8,000, 7,000 miles.

26:30.839 --> 26:31.964
Yeah.

26:32.173 --> 26:35.926
The mandate from Katy
is to tour for two weeks,

26:36.011 --> 26:39.346
and then take three or four days
off to spend time with Russell.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.849
I mean, it will
make you tired, going back and forth.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.270
It's fine right?

26:49.691 --> 26:52.484
All right, Bradford. We can do it.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.111
She will spend three days there

26:54.195 --> 26:55.821
and then get back
just in time for the show.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.248
One, two, three!

27:06.333 --> 27:07.625
Buona sera!

27:14.424 --> 27:16.091
To see Russell,
Katy would fly to New York.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.552
She'd fly to LA,
she'd fly to New Orleans.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.139
From Europe. She was committed.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.516
- One, two, three!
- London!

27:25.060 --> 27:27.978
I always told him,
"Look, buddy, I'm making a record.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.688
"And then I gotta tour that record.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.482
"Are you sure about this?"

27:31.566 --> 27:35.069
And we decided, yeah, we're sure about
this, we can do it.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.279
I'm not always going to be on the road.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.409
"Biggest show yet!"
On three. One, two, three!

27:42.494 --> 27:43.702
Biggest show yet!

28:00.595 --> 28:01.595
Everyone...

28:01.680 --> 28:02.930
This is Glen Ballard.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.891
He is responsible
basically for my existence.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.560
And I met him when I was...

28:08.895 --> 28:09.895
Seventeen.

28:09.979 --> 28:13.065
Seventeen and I played him a song and
then he took me under his wing.

28:13.149 --> 28:15.734
And that's basically why I'm here
this evening, so...

28:15.985 --> 28:17.111
Glen Ballard everyone.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.320
Thank you.

28:18.446 --> 28:22.032
I think it's probably 2001,
someone knocked on my door.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.284
And I said, "Hello. What do you want?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.078
"Are you a writer?" She said, "Yes."

28:26.162 --> 28:28.497
I said, "Do you want to
play me a song?" She said, "Yes."

28:28.957 --> 28:30.499
Bingo. Two great answers.

28:30.583 --> 28:33.085
Opened the guitar case
and she played a song for me.

28:33.169 --> 28:34.920
And it blew me away.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.715
Right away I said,
"I wanna sign you. You're it."

28:37.966 --> 28:39.758
People don't knock
on my door every day.

28:39.843 --> 28:42.803
The last time someone did that,
honestly, it was Alanis Morissette.

28:50.019 --> 28:53.105
In the five years that she was with me,

28:53.189 --> 28:55.023
she wrote over 100 songs.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.900
She was writing, writing,
writing, writing, writing.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.485
Singing, singing, singing.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.987
Recording, recording, recording.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.406
And developing this vocabulary
as a writer.

29:12.208 --> 29:15.711
She was really, really
smart, and she was really, really fun.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.255
And she knew how to write a song

29:18.339 --> 29:20.174
that communicated all kinds of things.

29:36.149 --> 29:39.443
We were with Island Def
Jam for a little over a year.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.111
She had everything it took.

29:41.196 --> 29:44.782
But I couldn't get
the label to pay attention to that.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.075
So we took one to Columbia
at that point.

29:47.202 --> 29:51.371
I was approached by one of the
senior executives at Columbia.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.292
She showed me a music video

29:55.376 --> 29:57.002
that she had shot with Glen Ballard.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.712
It was for a song called The Box.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.590
And I just fell in love
with her instantly.

30:12.977 --> 30:14.978
When we first signed Katy,

30:15.063 --> 30:18.148
she had been kind of kicking
around for a couple of years.

30:18.233 --> 30:22.319
She had been signed to a gospel label
in Nashville, which failed.

30:22.403 --> 30:24.363
She had been on Island Def Jam.

30:24.447 --> 30:25.697
Dropped.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.283
And now she was kind of
banking on this deal

30:28.368 --> 30:29.993
with Columbia Records to pan out.

30:30.537 --> 30:35.123
There was some concern
about how to give her

30:35.208 --> 30:38.418
a shot in the market,
and how to give her a point of entry.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.712
So they came up with this idea

30:40.797 --> 30:42.923
to hook her up
with these producers called The Matrix.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.842
This is The Matrix.

30:44.926 --> 30:48.136
The genius producers
have finally become a band.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.472
At the time,
they had just had huge success

30:50.557 --> 30:52.266
with Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne.

30:52.725 --> 30:56.103
So it was a perfect opportunity
for her to get some traction.

30:57.021 --> 31:00.274
Right away they had A&R people

31:00.358 --> 31:03.402
telling her who
she should be, who she needed to be.

31:03.486 --> 31:04.862
One was Avril Lavigne.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.739
Really go for it, you gotta be
really angry on this chorus.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.035
I'm Avril Lavigne!

31:15.582 --> 31:17.749
You know, she was still in that phase

31:17.834 --> 31:19.251
of soaking everything in.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.920
But after a while,
it just started to get annoying.

31:22.005 --> 31:25.007
It was people talking about, "She should
be the next Kelly Clarkson,"

31:25.091 --> 31:27.467
"She should be
more like Ashlee Simpson."

31:27.844 --> 31:30.387
You know...
And the whole time she just kept saying,

31:30.471 --> 31:32.556
"I just want to be the first Katy Perry.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.974
"I don't want to be the next anybody.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.642
"I just want to be the first Katy."

32:07.508 --> 32:09.843
She was being
asked to go write with these people.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.847
She hated the music.
Katy had a very different vision.

32:13.932 --> 32:17.935
Whatever happened
to just writing a really good song

32:18.019 --> 32:19.853
and letting it be
a great song and having emotion?

32:19.938 --> 32:23.190
Listen, I have two
lovely albums of my own

32:23.274 --> 32:27.152
sitting in top drawers in my
bedroom, gathering dust right now,

32:27.236 --> 32:30.280
that were full of
wonderful, poetic, sweet material

32:30.365 --> 32:31.907
that no one gave a... about.

32:51.886 --> 32:54.596
The label, they didn't
understand her clothes,

32:54.681 --> 32:57.349
they didn't understand
her personality,

32:57.892 --> 32:59.893
and they didn't understand
her point of view.

33:00.353 --> 33:02.646
It wasn't a good
representation of who she was.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.147
And it fell apart.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.108
Sandy, I'm gonna
lay it on the line to you.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.777
It doesn't feel right
and we're sick of doing this record.

33:09.862 --> 33:11.863
The record wasn't gonna come out,

33:11.948 --> 33:14.241
and she was signed
to the record company

33:14.325 --> 33:15.826
and nothing was happening.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.799
I remember one of the heads of
the record company saying,

33:30.883 --> 33:33.885
"You know, we really can't drop her

33:33.970 --> 33:38.098
"because she'll probably go sign
somewhere else and become a big star.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.558
"And we just can't have that."

33:57.285 --> 33:59.703
I just thought
they should just let her go,

33:59.787 --> 34:01.538
it was like holding somebody hostage.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.085
It was probably
her most desperate moment.

34:12.467 --> 34:16.344
I had no money.
My car was impounded twice.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.889
Nothing was going my way.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.600
People saw me as damaged goods.

34:23.143 --> 34:26.730
I think the lowest point
in her life was when she called me,

34:26.813 --> 34:29.315
her 16-year-old brother,
and asked me for money.

34:29.650 --> 34:32.402
Like, "Sorry, I don't
even have enough money for myself."

34:33.321 --> 34:35.072
I was feeling lost.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.284
I would ask myself
"What happened to that 13-year-old girl

34:39.368 --> 34:42.161
"that was playing the blue guitar?

34:42.246 --> 34:45.331
"Is she still there?
Am I still that person?"

34:56.260 --> 34:58.970
She continued to write.
She continued to play shows.

34:59.514 --> 35:04.351
And, I think, you know, it was
encouragement to see the fans respond.

35:15.613 --> 35:18.073
Being at these
record labels and being told,

35:18.157 --> 35:19.699
"That's not the right song.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.618
"That's not what people want to hear."

35:21.702 --> 35:23.870
The audience
was telling her something different.

35:24.580 --> 35:27.290
"You are doing what
you should be doing.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.500
"Keep writing those songs."

35:34.799 --> 35:36.967
I cared about her
too much as a person

35:37.051 --> 35:41.805
to think that somebody could
actually just crush this girl's life.

35:42.098 --> 35:44.766
They just crush her dreams
for their own ego.

35:45.726 --> 35:48.311
And I just remember thinking,
"I can't work here anymore.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.689
"They're not gonna
do anything with her.

35:50.773 --> 35:53.608
"Let's see. Let's see if we
can get her over to Capitol."

35:53.693 --> 35:56.987
So I stole all the files.
I stole all the Katy files.

35:57.071 --> 36:00.907
I just grabbed them and I put them
under my arm and I just snuck out.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.917
I hired Angelica Cob
to run our publicity department.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.171
She said to me, "You've gotta
meet this girl, Katy Perry.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.231
"I think she's a real star.
You should get together with her."

36:18.759 --> 36:21.928
Hello. I bet you're
wondering where I am at right now.

36:22.138 --> 36:26.099
I am in the office of Jason Flom.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.811
Act professional. Act professional.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.938
Kitties.

36:33.482 --> 36:34.774
I think someone's coming.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.986
When an artist who's
destined for stardom walks in a room,

36:38.070 --> 36:40.197
they walk and talk

36:40.281 --> 36:43.450
and wear their clothes
differently than normal people do.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.453
And I was immediately
taken by her presence.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.248
Soon after that, the skies opened up.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.585
Capitol believed in her vision,

36:53.669 --> 36:56.046
and they'd called,
saying they want to sign Katy.

36:56.756 --> 36:59.883
Girls? Senoritas?

37:01.677 --> 37:02.969
There were three songs

37:03.054 --> 37:05.263
being debated to be a single.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.890
The right song had to be chosen.

37:08.309 --> 37:10.143
Ultimately, it was Katy's call.

38:22.883 --> 38:25.760
And I'm hearing my song on the radio
for the first time ever in life,

38:25.886 --> 38:27.762
in Dallas, Texas. Whoo!

38:28.431 --> 38:29.472
I'm just so excited.

38:29.557 --> 38:32.517
I have never heard
my song on the radio.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.353
It was one of those magical records

38:35.438 --> 38:37.480
where the minute
it went on any radio station,

38:37.565 --> 38:38.815
everybody had to have it.

38:38.899 --> 38:41.693
She was really
connecting with the fans.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.903
It was a great introduction to Katy.

38:45.406 --> 38:49.492
I Kissed A Girl, in the number-one
spot for seven weeks.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.746
Things were moving so fast, we
hardly had time to celebrate.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.337
This is our bus.
It's a double-decker.

39:00.421 --> 39:03.423
It's amazing.
I can't believe that.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.720
I have been on a fast rocket,

39:08.804 --> 39:11.097
holding on for dear life.

39:13.601 --> 39:15.810
People think
that she was an overnight success.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.062
She really wasn't.

39:17.146 --> 39:19.022
You know, she was
working at it her whole life.

39:26.447 --> 39:27.822
Come on!

39:33.287 --> 39:34.287
Shake it!

40:05.194 --> 40:08.405
When Katy decided that I Kissed A Girl
was gonna be her first single

40:08.489 --> 40:09.656
I said, "Have you told Mom and Dad?"

40:09.740 --> 40:11.408
And she said, "No, but can you?"

40:11.492 --> 40:14.494
I went, "Katy!"

40:15.955 --> 40:18.164
I was a little concerned, yeah,
'cause I thought, "My ministry,

40:18.249 --> 40:20.750
"after 30-something years, is over."

40:20.835 --> 40:22.377
But you know what?
Never had a problem.

40:24.630 --> 40:28.216
I think people
love the idea of a good girl gone bad.

40:28.884 --> 40:31.970
And they think
my parents have disowned me.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.721
But that's not the story at all.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.853
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

40:40.187 --> 40:41.271
Hi!

40:41.480 --> 40:42.856
How did you like it, Mom?

40:43.023 --> 40:44.023
It was great.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.491
What's your favorite song?
I Kissed A Girl?

40:47.027 --> 40:48.111
No.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.365
We just love her.
No matter what she was singing about,

40:52.450 --> 40:53.575
or no matter what she was doing,

40:53.659 --> 40:54.659
she's just a blessing.

40:55.035 --> 40:56.995
I really do believe in God.

40:57.079 --> 41:01.958
Probably don't believe in all of the
same details that my mom believes,

41:02.543 --> 41:06.546
but I have a spiritual relationship with
God, and it's one-on-one,

41:06.714 --> 41:08.965
and it's continually evolving.

41:17.850 --> 41:20.518
They can...
They can probably go up a bit.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.078
Let me go and check
with the powers that be.

41:22.162 --> 41:23.605
They have to go up because they're...

41:24.064 --> 41:26.399
Why can't they just go up
to those two spots?

41:26.525 --> 41:27.917
I'm pretty sure...
I'm pretty sure they can.

41:28.002 --> 41:31.529
They're invading
the screen so much. You know?

41:31.822 --> 41:35.450
I think it's
a general misconception to people

41:35.534 --> 41:38.161
to think that she's just a puppet.

41:38.245 --> 41:40.955
You know, like, "Oh, she doesn't
actually do any of this herself.

41:41.373 --> 41:42.874
"People just do it all for her,

41:42.958 --> 41:45.084
"and she just goes in there
and sings the songs."

41:45.377 --> 41:46.753
That's not the case with her at all.

41:47.379 --> 41:50.173
Mate, do you know if it's possible
to raise the reveal clouds

41:50.257 --> 41:51.674
once the reveal is done?

41:51.759 --> 41:53.134
The two outside clouds?

41:53.219 --> 41:54.344
Yeah, the two outside clouds.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.970
I'm just at
front of house with the boss

41:56.055 --> 41:58.097
and she's asking if
they can go higher once it's done.

41:58.265 --> 42:01.601
Katy is
the Chairman-CEO of Katy Perry.

42:02.102 --> 42:04.854
She earned it.
She had the years where she kinda

42:04.939 --> 42:06.981
had to go with whatever
everybody else wanted,

42:07.608 --> 42:09.859
and now she doesn't
have to do that anymore.

42:17.785 --> 42:19.327
Watching the career take off,

42:19.411 --> 42:23.289
it would seem like every day was
some big new development.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.377
I remember talking to her
on the phone

42:27.461 --> 42:30.213
and she had said
a few things, I had said a few things,

42:30.297 --> 42:33.341
then it kinda got silent
and she said, "I met someone."

42:52.069 --> 42:53.361
The first time Katy met Russell

42:53.445 --> 42:55.572
was on the set of
Get Him to the Greek.

42:55.656 --> 42:58.074
Then afterwards I remember
her saying, "He's cute."

43:05.040 --> 43:07.250
He really wanted to hang out with me

43:07.334 --> 43:08.918
but I was like, "No, no, no, no.

43:09.003 --> 43:12.297
"You gotta take me to dinner.
You gotta wine and dine me."

43:28.022 --> 43:32.734
On our first date we went to a really
cute little restaurant in New York

43:32.818 --> 43:37.113
and just talked for, like,
two-and-a-half hours.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.463
There was just like
this immediate connection.

44:36.048 --> 44:39.175
Her career was blowing up
and her love life was blowing up.

44:39.259 --> 44:41.636
Everything was
just go, go, go. And it was so intense.

44:42.012 --> 44:44.180
I feel like they fell in love so fast

44:44.264 --> 44:45.973
it was just like they're magnets.

45:03.367 --> 45:05.743
This is probably
the best show you've performed.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.870
Well, yeah, I think it's
because I like to show off

45:07.955 --> 45:09.305
- in front of my friends and family.
- Yeah.

45:09.389 --> 45:11.124
- And your husband.
- And my husband.

45:11.583 --> 45:13.543
Hubby, when you're here, I do better!

45:14.795 --> 45:16.462
- Hi.
- Hello, sausage.

45:17.673 --> 45:18.798
That was amazing.

45:19.341 --> 45:20.425
- Yeah?
- Yes.

45:20.509 --> 45:21.634
I'm tired.

45:21.760 --> 45:22.969
I'm not surprised.

45:23.053 --> 45:26.389
They definitely fell in love
really quickly and very deeply.

45:26.640 --> 45:31.352
She always talked
about a fairy-tale kind of situation

45:31.437 --> 45:33.479
and I think she really
found that with Russell.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.148
See you everyone.

45:38.152 --> 45:39.277
Katy?

45:39.778 --> 45:41.170
- What, you got your meet and greet?
- Yeah.

45:41.196 --> 45:42.363
Bye, darlin'!

45:43.574 --> 45:46.576
I think, and maybe this is just

45:46.660 --> 45:49.662
the fantasy idea I have in my head,

45:49.747 --> 45:52.248
but I think, honestly,

45:52.332 --> 45:55.251
that I found the love of my life.

45:55.919 --> 45:57.295
But it took a while.

46:02.342 --> 46:03.676
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

46:04.052 --> 46:05.219
See you, Ange.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.472
Way past your bedtime.

46:09.141 --> 46:10.141
I know.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.102
Hello, welcome.
How are you?

46:13.812 --> 46:15.396
Hello. Oh my goodness.

46:15.481 --> 46:17.106
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.649
- Hello.
- Hello.

46:18.776 --> 46:19.984
How are you?

46:20.068 --> 46:22.003
- Katy, I'm Christine. Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.529
- I'm Jim.
- Hi, Jim.

46:23.614 --> 46:24.906
What's up? I'm Katy.

46:25.032 --> 46:26.282
Do you live close by?

46:26.366 --> 46:28.242
I live in California, in Sacramento.

46:28.619 --> 46:29.952
Are you 27?

46:30.204 --> 46:32.455
Am I 27?
Yeah, but do I look...

46:32.539 --> 46:33.831
How old do I look?

46:34.041 --> 46:35.374
- Sixteen.
- Thanks.

46:37.336 --> 46:38.628
Good job.

46:38.712 --> 46:40.129
Perfect. Good answer.

46:40.339 --> 46:43.049
I know I look 16,
and I act like I'm 16, too.

46:43.300 --> 46:44.300
Do you like hotels?

46:44.384 --> 46:45.885
Do I like hotels?

46:46.386 --> 46:48.137
I have no choice but to like hotels

46:48.222 --> 46:51.432
'cause I live in hotels
all the time. Yeah.

46:52.226 --> 46:53.684
- What?
- What's your favorite song?

46:53.769 --> 46:55.061
My favorite song?

46:55.187 --> 46:56.938
- Like the one that I sing?
- Yeah.

46:57.022 --> 46:59.232
Firework.
What's your favorite song?

46:59.441 --> 47:00.608
Pearl.

47:00.692 --> 47:02.735
Oh, wow.
You're a really big fan.

47:03.654 --> 47:04.987
You know all the songs.

47:05.447 --> 47:07.406
You got a lot of questions out of me.

47:07.741 --> 47:09.408
That's more than any reporter.

47:10.035 --> 47:15.373
"You are the cutest boy

47:15.457 --> 47:18.334
"I have ever met."

47:18.418 --> 47:19.544
Do you want some candy?

47:19.628 --> 47:22.171
Yeah, of course they do.
They're not Martians.

47:24.591 --> 47:26.259
Wait, one last thing.

47:26.802 --> 47:28.094
Do you want to come on stage?

47:28.929 --> 47:30.054
Yes!

47:31.557 --> 47:34.016
Her fans are so important to her.

47:34.101 --> 47:36.644
She goes above and beyond
to make sure

47:36.728 --> 47:40.147
that her fans have access to her life.

47:40.482 --> 47:43.401
I can't believe she's right
there! I'm gonna die!

47:43.902 --> 47:46.946
She knows that she wouldn't be where
she is without her fans.

47:50.951 --> 47:52.994
- Do you want to be on stage?
- Yeah!

47:54.621 --> 47:56.789
Do you guys want
to go on stage tonight?

47:58.792 --> 47:59.792
Oh, my God, thank you so much!

47:59.877 --> 48:01.085
You're welcome.

48:38.665 --> 48:41.792
Oh, my gosh!
It's Kitty Purry!

48:48.717 --> 48:50.217
Is Katy Perry's sister here?

48:52.012 --> 48:53.095
Because we heard that...

48:53.180 --> 48:54.680
Is it true that
she gives out backstage passes

48:54.765 --> 48:56.557
to people in cool costumes?

48:57.559 --> 48:59.435
Would you like to be
on stage tonight?

48:59.519 --> 49:00.519
- Yes!
- Yes!

49:00.604 --> 49:02.688
Wanna go on stage tonight?

49:02.773 --> 49:03.773
- Yes!
- Yes!

49:06.610 --> 49:07.860
Love your tie!

49:08.111 --> 49:09.862
Are you her sister?

49:18.413 --> 49:20.081
I gotta go pee!

49:22.793 --> 49:26.003
Kitty! Shall we have
some people come dance on stage?

49:28.632 --> 49:29.840
- You forgot your pants.
- I know.

49:33.804 --> 49:35.471
Oh, I want that hot dog right there!

49:36.223 --> 49:39.308
Hot Dog!
Gingerbread Man! Peacock.

49:39.393 --> 49:40.768
Gingerbread Man and Peacock.

49:41.436 --> 49:42.895
These two, these two!

49:45.107 --> 49:46.399
Her! And her!

49:46.984 --> 49:48.567
And Leaf! Come on, Leaf!

49:55.784 --> 49:57.410
Holy hot dog!

50:30.944 --> 50:33.446
Thank you so much for
believing in my weirdness!

50:40.787 --> 50:42.538
- What did you have for lunch today?
- Chick-fil-A.

50:42.622 --> 50:43.914
What did you have
for dinner last night?

50:43.999 --> 50:45.082
Taco Bell.

50:45.167 --> 50:47.126
- What are you eating right now?
- Pizza.

50:47.961 --> 50:50.004
- Looks savory, that.
- Oh, yeah.

50:50.088 --> 50:51.172
Oh, yeah.

51:22.496 --> 51:23.788
Almost.

51:24.372 --> 51:26.373
That's, like, really not
appropriate right now.

51:26.458 --> 51:27.792
Super appropriate.

51:37.427 --> 51:39.053
She's in the perfect position for it.

51:39.429 --> 51:40.554
Heinie hiccup.

51:43.850 --> 51:45.017
She's so gassy.

51:45.102 --> 51:46.102
I need a mask.

51:46.186 --> 51:47.353
You need one with more bass.

51:47.521 --> 51:48.771
More bass?

51:49.356 --> 51:50.356
Wow.

51:51.817 --> 51:53.192
Could smell that one,
couldn't you, Todd?

51:53.276 --> 51:54.318
It's fine. We're starting.

51:59.032 --> 52:01.325
Come see me when you're done, okay?

52:17.551 --> 52:19.468
Sorry, Kim!

52:21.847 --> 52:23.639
Wait, will you
tell me what was there?

52:24.808 --> 52:27.852
Dennis has not...
It's not, like, official out there,

52:27.936 --> 52:29.562
but Dennis just tipped us off.

52:29.729 --> 52:32.439
You did it. Your fifth
number-one single. Last Friday Night.

52:32.607 --> 52:34.483
- Is that a record?
- It's a record.

52:34.818 --> 52:36.402
- Damn!
- It's a record.

52:36.570 --> 52:37.611
Congratulations.

52:40.574 --> 52:42.950
Katy Perry has just made
pop music history

52:43.034 --> 52:45.286
doing something
The Beatles never did,

52:45.370 --> 52:47.621
Elvis hasn't done it,
not even Madonna.

52:47.706 --> 52:48.998
Not even Madonna?

52:49.082 --> 52:51.125
Only Michael Jackson,
until this week, believe it or not.

52:51.585 --> 52:54.295
The first woman
in the history of pop music...

52:54.421 --> 52:58.966
to have five songs from one
album hit number one on the chart.

53:00.468 --> 53:03.012
She can write a killer tune,
do you know what I mean?

53:03.096 --> 53:05.306
Like, a lot of albums
do have a lot of filler tracks on them,

53:05.390 --> 53:07.808
but every song
on her album is a hit single.

53:08.268 --> 53:10.477
As a special award of achievement.

53:13.565 --> 53:14.815
Congratulations.

53:14.900 --> 53:16.192
Thank you.

53:16.318 --> 53:17.318
Yay!

53:18.528 --> 53:20.029
- Congratulations.
- Oh.

53:20.322 --> 53:22.156
If I could see your face right now.

53:22.449 --> 53:23.449
I'm really happy.

53:23.575 --> 53:24.783
You just can't tell.

53:25.368 --> 53:27.119
You look like a Hershey Kiss.

53:28.121 --> 53:29.580
To equal Michael Jackson,

53:29.664 --> 53:32.708
someone that's so iconic,
on your second album,

53:32.792 --> 53:35.961
to have that many
number-ones is pretty fricking cool.

53:36.213 --> 53:39.423
Pop stars don't come any bigger
than the brilliant Katy Perry.

53:40.300 --> 53:41.634
Katy Perry!

53:42.219 --> 53:45.596
Katy has always been
very true to herself,

53:46.473 --> 53:49.475
and I think that that's
why people relate to her.

53:50.644 --> 53:54.021
Katy Perry is the hottest pop
star in the world right now.

53:55.774 --> 53:59.318
She has a very specific
vision in her head.

53:59.694 --> 54:02.863
And her vision's a little crazy.

54:02.989 --> 54:06.367
Hi, I'm Kathy Beth Terry
and this is my bedroom.

54:07.118 --> 54:10.329
But it's come together
in an amazing way.

54:10.830 --> 54:12.581
Best party ever!

54:15.961 --> 54:18.629
It took us five years
to get a record out.

54:19.631 --> 54:22.508
But we never gave up
because she never gave up.

54:23.635 --> 54:25.469
It's hard not to get emotional

54:25.553 --> 54:28.472
because her careerjust blew up.

54:31.851 --> 54:33.560
I'm in the middle of
the biggest tour,

54:33.645 --> 54:35.312
the biggest success of my life.

54:36.523 --> 54:41.110
And the ability to be able to share
these experiences with so many people,

54:41.194 --> 54:44.071
my family, my friends, my fans...

54:45.198 --> 54:46.782
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

54:46.866 --> 54:48.409
That's what makes me really happy.

55:01.214 --> 55:03.215
My sister, not only does
she work hard on tour,

55:03.300 --> 55:04.550
she likes to play hard on tour.

55:04.718 --> 55:06.719
Tomorrow we go to the water park.

55:08.346 --> 55:09.513
Hello.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.558
Oh, my God!

55:13.893 --> 55:16.645
I feel great. I'm really,
really excited about my sister,

55:16.771 --> 55:18.230
who is scared of heights.

55:21.151 --> 55:23.694
Oh, my God.
Look at Angela's face!

55:25.405 --> 55:27.156
Angela, it's really fun.

55:31.494 --> 55:32.745
Oh, my God!

55:32.871 --> 55:34.038
Wait, here we go.

55:47.719 --> 55:49.595
How you feeling, sister?

56:01.107 --> 56:02.858
Do you want to hear a good idea?

56:03.193 --> 56:04.276
- Sure.
- This is from Baz Halpin.

56:04.361 --> 56:07.363
I think...
I think we need to have

56:07.447 --> 56:11.200
Kathy Beth Terry come on stage

56:12.786 --> 56:14.495
during T.G.I.F.,
but I don't think it can be you,

56:14.579 --> 56:16.955
'cause I think we want to make the world
think it's a different person.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.248
Oh, hells to the no.

56:18.333 --> 56:19.500
Come on, Angela.

56:20.126 --> 56:24.880
Angela! Angela!
Angela! Angela!

56:24.964 --> 56:27.049
You would have to triple my pay.

56:28.551 --> 56:30.803
Oh, it's so her!

56:33.056 --> 56:34.181
Yep, we're related.

56:39.979 --> 56:41.688
I feel like I might pee.

56:41.773 --> 56:44.525
Or puke. Or poop.

56:45.443 --> 56:50.739
Everyone!
Please welcome Kathy Beth Terry!

56:52.409 --> 56:53.659
Yeah!

57:02.752 --> 57:07.131
Go Kathy, go Kathy! It's your birthday,
it's your birthday, it's your birthday!

57:08.842 --> 57:10.259
Come on, let me hear it!

57:50.633 --> 57:51.925
Pick it up and eat its face.

57:59.100 --> 58:02.394
I've heard Katy talk about Tokyo so
much and I have never been.

58:02.937 --> 58:04.229
I'm pretty excited.

58:08.735 --> 58:11.236
This establishment serves
tea and coffee

58:11.321 --> 58:12.779
while you hang out with cats.

58:13.781 --> 58:16.700
They charge you to sit with cats.

58:19.412 --> 58:21.955
Oh, my gosh, this one
is wearing a little shirt.

58:24.250 --> 58:25.876
It's licking my hand.

58:27.212 --> 58:29.546
Does this officially
make us cat ladies?

58:30.423 --> 58:31.673
We look like freaks.

58:52.445 --> 58:53.445
I love you.

58:54.030 --> 58:55.280
I love you so much.

58:58.952 --> 59:01.119
- One, two, three. Japan!
- Japan!

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:22.117
She's crying. Don't cry.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:40.529
Where's my relationship days?

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:44.950
Can I see a calendar really quick?

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:51.581
The next three days I have off...

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.083
are tenth, eleventh, twelfth.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:56.128
That's like 18 days apart.

01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:57.629
Yeah.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.173
Isn't he coming to you?

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:01.967
Well he should...

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.343
but he's not.

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:05.262
It's real...

01:02:05.763 --> 01:02:06.972
Cray-cray. (Crazy)

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:11.935
Katy is constantly
trying to make these little side trips

01:02:12.019 --> 01:02:14.813
off the tour when everybody really
is supposed to be resting

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.862
to fly to where Russell is
and make it work,

01:02:21.946 --> 01:02:25.490
make it matter,
show that she cares, because she does.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.537
And it's just, with everything
else going on in her life

01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:32.748
and her careerjust exploding,

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.334
she is running herself ragged.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.593
Just trying to keep my marriage alive.

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:54.978
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you.

01:02:55.062 --> 01:02:57.272
And I would think that
you would look haggard.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.732
You know...

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:00.192
I mean, you should be exhausted.

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.611
Well, you should see me
with all this off.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:06.198
No, but like you were just, you were all
over the place and working like crazy.

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.449
I guess it suits you, huh?

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:10.160
And now, what will you do
when you finish this tour?

01:03:10.244 --> 01:03:11.453
How will you celebrate?

01:03:11.537 --> 01:03:12.704
I'm gonna take a long nap.

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:17.167
I'm just gonna sleep
for a long time and enjoy my husband.

01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:19.085
Yeah, he's adorable.
I just love him, you know that.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.670
Oh, thank you. He's mine.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:22.047
Yeah. Okay.

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:23.715
That's okay.

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.942
My husband just sent me
a picture of a McDonald's.

01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:44.236
I think it's the one by La Brea.

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:47.948
And the address is 1133,
which is our numbers.

01:03:50.576 --> 01:03:51.576
And...

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.996
we should name our first born Ronald.

01:03:57.291 --> 01:04:00.418
When I decide to
become a mother, I wanna be a mother.

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:03.296
Are you gonna get pregnant?

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:07.467
But right now I don't think
it's the right timing for me.

01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:13.056
Oh, yeah, I think
she'd be an amazing mother. Yeah.

01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:16.768
She's... I mean, I think that
her devotion to her career

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:19.688
would carry over with
her devotion to a family.

01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:23.233
I think that she would just
fully immerse herself in it.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:26.152
I don't think that
she should be a mother right now.

01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:30.490
A baby can't have a baby,
and I'm still a baby.

01:04:47.758 --> 01:04:50.969
You got like, a lot of people waiting.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:52.929
Do you want us to check back with
you in fifteen?

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:54.723
I'm just so tired.

01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:58.894
Should we just go ahead
and push everything to after for sure?

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:01.146
Honestly, your show's most important.

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:07.277
If you think that
another little power nap would help,

01:05:07.361 --> 01:05:09.529
we can clear everyone out of the room

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:11.531
and just give you a quiet 15.

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:19.748
Well, then we wouldn't be able to do a
meet-and-greet, though. You know?

01:05:19.832 --> 01:05:21.458
It's either now or never.

01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:27.255
Being in love is the dream,

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.217
and then the reality of
making it work with the marriage

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:33.345
is not like the movies.

01:05:34.138 --> 01:05:37.682
There's a lot more compromise,
a lot more sacrifice.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.352
You know?
Or else it just won't work.

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:41.728
Hi!

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:45.607
It took me forever to put all this
on. I'm so sorry.

01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:47.484
- You look fabulous.
- How are you?

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.486
What is this? I feel like it's a
dance floor.

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:52.614
We didn't realize what was going on

01:05:52.698 --> 01:05:55.617
in her personal life at that time.

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:01.539
Where's security? Security!

01:06:02.249 --> 01:06:05.251
I think Katy shielded most of us

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:08.546
from the reality
of what was happening.

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:12.634
This next song
goes out to all the lovers here tonight.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.802
Being one of her closest friends,

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:42.390
it's hard to see the stress,
the frustration, the doubt.

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:46.144
You could see
how difficult it is for two people

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:49.397
with crazy-busy careers
on opposite sides of the world

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.107
trying to just make it work.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:28.412
She never cries.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:31.624
She's been like this for 20 minutes.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:33.417
I can hear you still.

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:34.836
I know.

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:37.714
What's with these tears, Katy?

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.256
I don't know.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.849
So are you gonna do this show?

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.270
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on here.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.063
- I think she feels depressed.
- Yeah.

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:05.033
Oh, look what we have.
A trinkets box.

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:07.452
Let me see that.

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:09.287
Here.

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:13.291
That's not meant to make you upset.

01:10:24.511 --> 01:10:25.511
What is that?

01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:28.681
It's the necklace that she got for her
birthday from Russell...

01:10:28.807 --> 01:10:31.142
and the day after she got it
she thought she lost it at the venue.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:36.648
Are you okay?

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:39.067
You doing okay?

01:10:41.153 --> 01:10:43.029
You have a lot on your mind right now?

01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:45.698
You have two options.

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:49.244
You can cancel the show,
or you can do your best.

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:00.421
Where's she at?

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:12.976
Start, Todd.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:36.416
Katy! Katy! Katy!

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:39.127
You can do it.
You're gonna get through it.

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:45.341
Come on, honey. You got this.

01:11:45.676 --> 01:11:49.554
Katy! Katy! Katy!
Katy! Katy!

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:03.901
Katy! Katy!
Katy! Katy! Katy!

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.572
Guys, be aware,
this could be going away. Stand by.

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.408
I'll advise you as I find out.

01:12:16.957 --> 01:12:18.416
- She ready?
- Yeah.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.168
All right, everybody, here we go.

01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:22.962
Let's stand by, house lights,
stand by on all three.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:37.393
Katy! Katy!
Katy! Katy! Katy!

01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:12.470
Sometimes we say "forever"

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:15.473
but it's easier to say than to do.

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.934
And this is called
The One That Got Away.

01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:40.516
Thanks.

01:14:40.934 --> 01:14:42.935
Can I tell you something?

01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:44.103
This song...

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:07.710
Do you know what?
I wish I could speak Portuguese!

01:15:23.977 --> 01:15:27.104
2011 was
a blow-out year for Katy Perry's career.

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:31.067
But professional success could not keep
her personal life together,

01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:32.735
and by the end of the year,
it crumbled.

01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:35.596
This morning, pop star Katy Perry
and comedian Russell Brand

01:15:35.681 --> 01:15:37.281
announced it was over.
They're filing for divorce...

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.408
Brand called it quits
on his marriage to Perry,

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:42.870
filing for divorce on grounds
of irreconcilable differences.

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:46.082
In recent weeks, there had been
speculation that something was wrong.

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:49.835
Proving once again that not all
matches have a fairy-tale ending.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.422
Granted, it is Hollywood
and relationships are bombarded

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:56.175
by temptation and different
traveling schedules.

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.052
Certainly, the two of them
are all over the globe...

01:15:58.136 --> 01:16:00.471
Let's remember,
Russell still has his reputation.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:04.308
Regardless, it must still be a very
difficult time for everyone involved.

01:16:17.489 --> 01:16:20.866
In the very beginning of me
getting into the industry,

01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:24.453
I would, you know,
be out and about, and I would hear

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:29.083
girls, or actresses,
or musicians, or whatever,

01:16:30.335 --> 01:16:33.212
you know, they would say, "Oh, no, I
don't want to be in a relationship

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.590
"because I don't wanna
have to choose between

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:38.092
"being in a relationship
and having a career."

01:16:38.176 --> 01:16:42.763
And I thought to myself,
"When I get to know that...

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.474
"When I find that person,

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:48.978
"that's gonna be my,
you know, life partner,

01:16:49.062 --> 01:16:50.646
"I won't ever have to choose.

01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:52.982
"Because they'll be accepting of me

01:16:53.066 --> 01:16:54.650
"completely, for who I am."

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:57.570
Not...
Not me being able to just like

01:16:57.654 --> 01:16:59.864
do whatever I want, necessarily,

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:05.995
but they won't be threatened
or have weird motives or whatever.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.873
They will be accepting of me,

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:13.836
the things I love,
the ambition, what I aspire to be,

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.756
what I want to create,
they'll be accepting and supportive.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.050
And then I
started to realize, "Oh, my God.

01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:22.511
"That's not true, that's...

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:25.931
"Like, that fairy tale that I had
is not true for me right now."

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:28.392
Yeah, but you still miss him.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.644
Yeah.

01:17:30.562 --> 01:17:32.396
I don't want to cry.

01:17:40.405 --> 01:17:45.868
Okay, again, everyone, this is a closed
rehearsal. A closed rehearsal.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:49.413
I'll tell you the truth, is that...

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:54.126
I mean, I'm a romantic and I don't...

01:17:54.211 --> 01:17:56.420
I kinda believed in this fairy tale.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.215
I mean...

01:17:59.299 --> 01:18:02.635
And in some ways I think that's always
been to my advantage,

01:18:02.719 --> 01:18:05.680
because, like, if you can
believe in something great,

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:07.682
I feel like you can
achieve something great.

01:18:09.267 --> 01:18:12.978
I have that same
belief system with everything.

01:18:13.271 --> 01:18:18.484
From career to my life,
my personal life, everything.

01:18:19.986 --> 01:18:23.364
And I will do
everything it takes to not fail.

01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:27.660
And I did
everything it took, but it still failed.

01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:33.165
The bad that
comes along with the good is a journey,

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:35.292
and I learned so much
from that journey.

01:19:12.789 --> 01:19:14.957
- Hi, sister.
- Hi, sister.

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:18.961
That's your dress?

01:19:19.379 --> 01:19:20.421
This was the one.

01:19:20.505 --> 01:19:21.589
Wow!

01:19:21.673 --> 01:19:23.466
- A little low back.
- Yeah.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:25.092
Gorgeous.

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:26.802
- Let's go try it on.
- Okay.

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:29.138
And you have a...
You have your veil?

01:19:29.222 --> 01:19:30.598
Well, we haven't decided on the veil,

01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:33.184
but this is the one
that I tried on, so...

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:35.436
Well, if I see something I like,

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.188
I guess I should put it on hold.

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:40.983
Yes, it is an
unfortunate time for her,

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:42.943
but it was really sweet
and I'm really happy

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:45.196
that she was able
to come out and be a part of it.

01:19:45.697 --> 01:19:48.699
To me she's not a celebrity or a pop
star, she's my sister.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:51.744
- That's pretty.
- Let me know whenever you're ready.

01:19:53.163 --> 01:19:54.413
Do you need any help?

01:20:09.095 --> 01:20:10.304
It's beautiful.

01:20:10.388 --> 01:20:11.722
Beautiful.

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:40.793
That is so beautiful.

01:20:40.877 --> 01:20:42.419
Yeah, it's really beautiful.

01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:54.932
This is going to sound
like the cheesiest thing ever,

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:58.602
but I feel like I've got a second
chance at a brilliant life.

01:20:59.604 --> 01:21:03.107
And me... Mind you, I already
have a brilliant life.

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:05.776
All I need to do is, like,
remind myself that I have it.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.500
I'm a firework. Simple as that.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:08.464
It makes me feel that
I could be anyone I want.

01:22:09.132 --> 01:22:11.467
Katy Perry inspires me
because... She just does.

01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:14.345
I mean, look at her.
She gots it all.

01:22:14.971 --> 01:22:18.682
I love the fact that
her lyrics are from life experiences.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:22.436
She tells you to just sparkle,
and, like, be the light.

01:22:22.812 --> 01:22:25.064
Stay strong and stay with your vision.

01:22:25.523 --> 01:22:30.110
You're an individual, and you're
you. You can't be anyone else,

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:32.029
because everyone else
is already taken.

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:13.404
Sing! Come on!

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:25.249
Let's go!

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:57.281
Sing!

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.352
Let's go!

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:14.984
I think she definitely
still has a message

01:25:14.985 --> 01:25:17.444
of love, and there's no judgment,

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:19.613
there's no misconceptions
or anything like that, just love.

01:25:20.698 --> 01:25:23.492
She speaks for her generation,
and she writes these lyrics.

01:25:23.576 --> 01:25:24.827
They're from her diary.

01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:27.037
This is the next phase of her life,

01:25:27.872 --> 01:25:30.040
and she's connecting with her fans.

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.042
It's undeniable, the connection.

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:34.795
She's not ready to slow down,

01:25:34.879 --> 01:25:36.104
and I don't know if she ever will be.

01:25:49.727 --> 01:25:50.936
Come on!

01:26:44.616 --> 01:26:45.616
Sing!

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:00.631
Now, put your hands up!

01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:06.720
Y'all ready for one last surprise?

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:12.309
It's time to get wet!

01:28:15.748 --> 01:28:18.959
Sweet dreams, Los Angeles!

01:28:19.043 --> 01:28:21.378
Sweet California dreams!

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:32.639
How was the concert, Grandma?

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:33.724
Loud!
