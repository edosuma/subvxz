to leave, and...

02:06.691 --> 02:08.431
everybody was invited in there.

gotten so intense.

you set it up,

02:33.370 --> 02:34.675
Towards the sea and everything?

02:34.805 --> 02:36.677
- Right.
- Teck is a source of joy.

02:36.807 --> 02:39.288
He has a way
of helping people

02:39.420 --> 02:41.725
to break down their walls.

02:41.856 --> 02:43.945
He lovingly lets me talk,

02:44.075 --> 02:47.253
which is always the key
to my sanctity.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.473

03:26.074 --> 03:28.425
The original people
that I came in,

03:28.556 --> 03:30.296
that I've been saying
from day one

03:30.426 --> 03:31.993
that I wanna be
partnered with,

03:32.123 --> 03:33.735
it's been that,
and I think people have known,

03:33.865 --> 03:36.171
since we first walked
in the house

03:36.302 --> 03:39.001
and we got our rooms,
were out of line.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.437
And I don't know if that's
a good thing or a bad thing,

03:41.569 --> 03:43.658
but right now it feels like
it's a damn good thing.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.963
- Same for me.
- So we can scurry around

03:46.094 --> 03:47.966
- and talk and do--
- Yeah, I'm not--

03:48.097 --> 03:51.013
I'm no longer worried
about any conversations

03:51.143 --> 03:53.057
you're having, I realize you're
playing your game as well.

03:53.188 --> 03:56.323
Not only is Jonna a fantastic
physical competitor,

03:56.453 --> 03:59.108
she is one of the best
political players

03:59.239 --> 04:01.457
that I've ever been around,
and what makes her great at it?

04:01.588 --> 04:04.287
She's going around, wanting
to just talk with people

04:04.418 --> 04:06.201
and trying to read
their vibes.

04:06.332 --> 04:08.204
Hopefully all the work
that she's been doing

04:08.335 --> 04:09.858
is gonna pay off in the end.

04:09.987 --> 04:13.122
I know if I make it
to a final with Jodi,

04:13.252 --> 04:15.123
yeah, I could play the game
of, oh, I wanna get

04:15.254 --> 04:19.084
the other strong girl out,
but I know that I can beat her.

04:19.214 --> 04:20.694
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

04:20.824 --> 04:22.478
you're my number one person,
and I want

04:22.610 --> 04:24.699
- to make it
to the end with you.
- Yeah.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.701
I've really grown as a player.
In the past,

04:26.831 --> 04:28.790
I, you know, was always
missing something.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.358
I also never really had
a supportive partner.

04:31.487 --> 04:34.230
Today, you didn't listen.
That was stupid.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.884
I'm not a bad partner,
like, I'm not.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.451
Everything isn't
always my fault.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.365
It's not always my fault.

04:39.495 --> 04:43.283
MJ has been there for me,
and he's been very encouraging

04:43.413 --> 04:45.415
and uplifting.
From day one,

04:45.545 --> 04:47.242
he said he had my back,

04:47.374 --> 04:49.158
and he proved it
throughout the game.

04:49.288 --> 04:51.552
And really it's not even
me playing my game,

04:51.682 --> 04:54.206
- it's playing our game.
- Mm-hmm.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.252
You got me to the end.

04:56.382 --> 04:57.992
- Same.
- And I can promise you that.

05:00.081 --> 05:02.779
[music]

05:16.750 --> 05:18.927
All right, everyone, welcome
to your next challenge.

05:19.057 --> 05:21.363
[applause]

05:21.495 --> 05:24.279
I heard that everyone wants
to run in one of my finals.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.064
- Yeah.
- Definitely want to.

05:26.194 --> 05:27.848
- Yeah.
- Well, today
we're gonna find out

05:27.978 --> 05:29.850
- who has what it takes.
- Okay.
- All right.

05:29.980 --> 05:32.505
Today's challenge is called
Dive and Conquer.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.637
Now, to begin,
you're gonna start right here

05:34.769 --> 05:36.336
at the starting line
with you and your partner.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.990
And when I say "go,"
you will run a half-mile

05:39.120 --> 05:42.211
to a cenote; you're then
gonna jump into that cenote,

05:42.341 --> 05:44.255
and you're gonna swim
to an answer key.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.302
You gotta memorize
the answer key,

05:46.432 --> 05:49.697
then run all the way back,
start solving your puzzle.

05:49.826 --> 05:52.090
If you solve it first go,
I'll be shocked.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.266
However, you can go
back and forth

05:54.396 --> 05:56.050
as many times
as you need to,

05:56.180 --> 05:59.096
but keep in mind,
it is a one-mile round trip.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.838
Now this is a timed event,
so the team to get this done

06:01.970 --> 06:04.451
the fastest will win
today's challenge

06:04.581 --> 06:06.408
and be safe from elimination,

06:06.540 --> 06:08.889
which is very important,
because there is

06:09.019 --> 06:11.196
no life shield
on this challenge.

06:11.326 --> 06:13.981
MJ: I hated to see
Cohutta and Casey go home,

06:14.112 --> 06:17.680
but by all of that happening,
nobody has the life shield today

06:17.812 --> 06:21.163
so it's gonna be
straight-up gameplay today.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.947
The winner's gonna be safe.

06:23.077 --> 06:24.687
The loser's going in.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.603
And everybody else
in between

06:26.733 --> 06:28.952
is gonna be biting their nails
if they don't win.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.086
The team to get
this done the slowest

06:31.216 --> 06:33.000
will be going straight
into the Arena.

06:33.130 --> 06:35.481
You might get eliminated.
You came all this way,

06:35.612 --> 06:37.178
worked this hard,
for nothing.

06:37.308 --> 06:39.442
Good luck, everyone.

06:39.572 --> 06:41.444
JANELLE: I definitely feel
like there's a target on us.

06:41.574 --> 06:43.663
I mean, if Nehemiah
and Melinda win today,

06:43.793 --> 06:45.622
it could possibly
be us going in.

06:45.752 --> 06:47.189
That's the end of the game, man;
ain't nothing for certain.

06:47.319 --> 06:48.973
- Yeah. Nothing personal.
- We just gotta win.

06:49.103 --> 06:50.192
- Yeah.
- We just gotta win.
We just gotta win.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.106
We wanna win this.
As long as

06:52.237 --> 06:54.108
she gives me 100%,
I'm gonna give her 100%,

06:54.238 --> 06:56.807
and I know she's all heart,
so we're gonna be good.

06:56.937 --> 06:59.069
We've been trying
to come together as a unit,

06:59.201 --> 07:00.855
and I think we've done
a great job at that.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.639
So I'm excited
for this opportunity

07:02.769 --> 07:04.511
to really show what we got.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.338
What she said.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.384
JODI: I feel like
we're 100%--

07:08.514 --> 07:10.341
if we don't win this,
we're guaranteed to go in.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.083
I think there's definitely
people that would like

07:12.213 --> 07:13.562
to see us leave before
the final, but we're gonna

07:13.694 --> 07:15.303
do our best to make sure
that doesn't happen.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.959
We're so close to the end.
Before, it was kind of like,

07:18.088 --> 07:19.439
we wanna win,
but we don't really know

07:19.569 --> 07:20.961
if we want the power,
but today...

07:21.091 --> 07:24.574
- we wanna win.
- We need the "dub."

07:24.704 --> 07:26.314
Big time.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.185
All right, you ready?

NEHEMIAH: It's like we're
a bunch of cattle being herded.

07:40.807 --> 07:42.156
The running path is
very narrow,

07:42.286 --> 07:43.637
so we're bumping
into each other.

07:43.766 --> 07:45.507
And we have to be
tethered to our partner.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.336
The goal, I think, would be
to not burn ourselves out.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.122
But we have no idea
how far the puzzle pieces are

07:51.252 --> 07:53.384
so we need to keep a good pace.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.826
[groan]

07:58.956 --> 08:00.697
You okay? You okay?

08:00.827 --> 08:02.742
You good?
Want me to slow down?

08:02.872 --> 08:04.613
All right.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.963
Where are we at here?
This one's pointing that way.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.791
This is not that good.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.533
Good God.

08:17.757 --> 08:19.586
Here's a life jacket!

there's a lot of detail

08:25.156 --> 08:27.463
to these skulls. How much detail
should we be studying?

08:27.593 --> 08:29.117
That's where it gets
a little confusing.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.466
We really need to stay
dialed in on this puzzle.

08:33.076 --> 08:34.817
Aa-hah!

08:39.082 --> 08:40.606
Let's try our best.

Cowabunga!

08:50.399 --> 08:52.096
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

08:52.226 --> 08:53.576
Yeah, you can, yeah, you can.

08:53.706 --> 08:55.099
Just step off,
you got it.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.623
- Yeah, you can.
- Okay, don't push me.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.232
- I'm not gonna push you.
- Mama Jaz is

08:58.363 --> 08:59.668

Relax, babe,
relax, come on.

09:02.932 --> 09:05.022
My heart's breaking for her.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.980

nudge her in, too.

Our plan is to memorize
one piece at a time.

09:29.090 --> 09:31.658
I tell MJ, okay,
I got the dark blue piece.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.615
So I memorize
where the dark blue piece is,

09:33.746 --> 09:35.399
in each row.

09:35.530 --> 09:36.966
It's much easier for me
to remember it that way.

09:37.097 --> 09:38.447
I got the last one.

09:42.711 --> 09:45.453
I'll take the top four.
You take the next four, okay?

- Yes.

get to the puzzle board,

if you're putting the puzzle
together for the first time,

16:27.682 --> 16:30.640
you can figure it out,

what's wrong with it,

leave each other,

you do. Just stop thinking.

stick with the alliance that's
gotten us to this point,

18:14.441 --> 18:16.834
or we can try to throw in
some strong teams

18:16.964 --> 18:19.141

get 'em out before the final.

People always look
for a reason

18:32.675 --> 18:34.374
to say why they're
nominating you,

on performance.

18:35.896 --> 18:38.290
Well, "performance-ly,"
we got second.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.978
You don't listen to anybody
in this house!

28:39.107 --> 28:41.894
And that is a problem!
You keep saying this stuff!

28:42.023 --> 28:44.113
It's privilege
and all this bullshit!

28:44.243 --> 28:46.159
Guess what, I'm not gonna bite
on this fish tonight.

28:46.288 --> 28:48.335
Jasmine, this ain't about you.

28:48.464 --> 28:50.816
That just shows your insecurity,
and that just shows

28:50.945 --> 28:53.252
how scared you are of me.
[laughs]

28:53.383 --> 28:55.167
Let's see how you do
in the rest of the game.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.951
[chuckling]

28:59.040 --> 29:01.042
No, I will not--
you're not my fuckin' mama.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.871
Your name is not fuckin'
Rhonda Reynaud.

29:03.001 --> 29:04.873
So I don't have
to bring shit down.

29:05.003 --> 29:06.919
JONNA: There are people
who are very good

29:07.048 --> 29:09.616
at using their words to try
to manipulate somebody

29:09.748 --> 29:13.142
or push somebody to a point that
will cause them to explode.

29:13.272 --> 29:15.491
And I know that Ayanna is
one of those people.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.364
Everybody in the house is
starting to see

29:17.493 --> 29:20.148
that side of Ayanna,
but Jasmine is

29:20.279 --> 29:21.803
just being the one
who's vocal about it.

29:21.933 --> 29:23.631
TECK: I am frustrated.

29:23.761 --> 29:25.240
I don't know
what to do with Ayanna,

29:25.372 --> 29:26.894
and I'm about to break.

29:27.026 --> 29:29.028
If you ruin my chances
to win 500,000,

29:29.157 --> 29:31.900
over a Greek salad,
fuck you!

29:40.082 --> 29:41.910
[music]

29:54.575 --> 29:56.403
We're coming up
on the end of the game.

29:56.532 --> 29:58.752
To me, it was a no-brainer.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.929
If we would've lost,
or if somebody

30:01.059 --> 30:02.887
from the other side
would've won,

30:03.018 --> 30:04.627
that there is
no doubt in my mind

30:04.759 --> 30:06.326
that I would--
that we'd be sitting

30:06.455 --> 30:07.761
where you're at right now.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.459
I do want to say that

30:09.589 --> 30:12.419
I feel like I'm
a positive source of energy.

30:12.548 --> 30:15.814
I haven't called anybody out
as far as privilege

30:15.943 --> 30:19.948
or doing dishes
and stuff like that.

30:20.078 --> 30:22.342
Because I have
an agreement with Teck,

30:22.471 --> 30:24.386
I am not going
to say anything.

30:24.518 --> 30:28.608
I will pass
the microphone to Teck.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.785
[laughter]

30:30.915 --> 30:33.482
Afraid anything I say
might incriminate myself,

30:33.614 --> 30:36.095
TECK: Today, I gave Ayanna
a daily challenge.

30:36.224 --> 30:37.704
If you sneeze,
don't say achoo.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.184
If you fart,
don't say excuse me.

30:39.315 --> 30:40.447
Don't say nothing
when we get up there.

30:40.576 --> 30:41.970
Just be quiet.

30:43.753 --> 30:45.191
This is not a personal thing.

30:45.320 --> 30:47.540
It's more just
a group collective,

30:47.671 --> 30:50.631
so my vote is
for Nehemiah and Melinda.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.939
JODI: My thought process is
putting Nehemiah and Melinda in,

30:54.068 --> 30:56.462
they're our greatest competition
from the other alliance,

30:56.593 --> 31:00.509
so it makes the most sense
with who we have to choose from.

31:00.641 --> 31:03.470
My vote is for Ayanna and Teck.

31:03.599 --> 31:05.864
BRAD: I've got a promise with
Nehemiah that I'm going to keep,

31:05.993 --> 31:07.821
and this time
it was clearly communicated.

31:07.952 --> 31:10.390
If I have to put
my friendship with Nehemiah

31:10.519 --> 31:12.566
above the game,
then that's what I'm gonna do.

31:12.695 --> 31:15.263
I'm no longer
an individual in this game.

31:15.394 --> 31:18.920
I have a partner,
and I have a group of people

31:19.050 --> 31:21.053
that I'm working with
that I have to respect.

31:21.182 --> 31:23.924
So I'm voting
for Melinda and Nehemiah.

31:25.839 --> 31:28.711
[music]

31:32.412 --> 31:34.587
My vote is for...

31:34.718 --> 31:38.417
Melinda and Nehemiah.

31:51.212 --> 31:53.301
There's a fire set
on our bridge,

31:53.432 --> 31:56.087
and they are trying
to bring the Palace down.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.480
The Challengeveterans know
what they're doing.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.701
But I'm a warrior.

32:00.830 --> 32:02.921
And the king will continue
to go on in this game.

32:03.050 --> 32:07.142
So, but before we leave,
I have a confession to make.

32:07.272 --> 32:08.883
Jodi...

32:11.058 --> 32:12.669
I ate your Greek salad.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.891
And I knew it was yours.

32:18.545 --> 32:19.762
Opened it up.

32:19.894 --> 32:22.243
I didn't use a fork.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.767
I ate it.

32:26.509 --> 32:28.642
Was I wrong for eating a salad
that didn't belong to me?

32:28.771 --> 32:31.557
Absolutely. So, I'm gonna
go ahead and own it.

32:31.688 --> 32:34.734
But while I own it,
I'm gonna fuck with her.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.692
It was delicious.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.652
I felt rich.
I felt special.

32:38.781 --> 32:40.914
I felt like I had a man
sitting there next to me,

32:41.046 --> 32:42.829
that could...
that could...

32:42.961 --> 32:45.180
that could help me--
I'm just telling you the truth.

32:45.310 --> 32:47.008
I told you it was my confession.

32:47.138 --> 32:49.444
Okay, well, I paid for that,
so I hope you enjoyed it.

32:49.576 --> 32:51.534
I got a little petty in me,
just a little.

32:51.664 --> 32:53.318
I'm not gonna hit you
in the ankle.

32:53.449 --> 32:55.146
I'm not gonna
Tonya Harding you,

32:55.277 --> 32:57.671
but if you leave your salad
out for, like, two hours,

32:57.800 --> 32:59.802
and it's just sitting there
looking pretty unloved,

32:59.933 --> 33:01.282
I'm gonna love it.

JODI: I don't know
if you're wanting me to laugh,

33:05.853 --> 33:07.420
like you're playing along
with me right now,

33:07.549 --> 33:09.377
but this is
really weird and creepy.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.205
Instead of calling me
privileged, next time

33:11.336 --> 33:12.642
you can just tell me
you ate my salad.

33:12.772 --> 33:14.035
It was about me last night.

33:14.165 --> 33:15.950
- Okay.
- And my moment.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.257
TECK: We still have
to play these people!

33:18.386 --> 33:20.259
Hell, Ayanna's my partner,
and I wanna throw her

33:20.388 --> 33:22.260
in the elimination arena
for stealing that damn salad.

JASMINE: I've been put through
the wringer here, you know?

33:34.969 --> 33:38.538
And my family has been put
through the wringer, and I...

33:38.667 --> 33:40.365
miss them so much.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.541
But I've gotta keep fighting.
I can't quit.

33:42.672 --> 33:46.588
I literally somehow
have to find...

33:46.720 --> 33:50.028
the energy to give Laterrian
100% of me

33:50.157 --> 33:51.986
in this elimination tonight.

33:52.726 --> 33:54.857
All right. Let's get it.

33:56.859 --> 33:58.513
[music]

34:02.213 --> 34:06.086
LATERRIAN: With Melinda
and Nehemiah, we understand

34:06.218 --> 34:08.088
the seriousness of the moment.

34:08.219 --> 34:10.264
We also understand
the magnitude

34:10.396 --> 34:12.311
of our friendship
and our bond.

34:14.922 --> 34:17.489
NEHEMIAH: Whether I win,
whether Laterrian wins

34:17.619 --> 34:20.971
or Melinda or Jasmine,
a King is still winning.

34:21.101 --> 34:26.063
And it's not an enemy who will
be taking one of us out.

34:33.027 --> 34:35.943
All right, everyone,
welcome back to the Arena.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.510
[cheering and applause]

34:37.639 --> 34:40.251
As always,
the first thing we gotta do,

34:40.382 --> 34:42.427
is get some players.
Let's start off

34:42.557 --> 34:44.211
with the losing players
from the last challenge--

34:44.342 --> 34:47.606
- Laterrian, come on out.
- [applause]

34:47.737 --> 34:49.608

35:02.012 --> 35:05.059
And now the team that
you selected to go against them:

35:05.190 --> 35:06.668
Nehemiah, come on out.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.367
[music]

35:10.891 --> 35:13.197
[applause]

35:15.809 --> 35:17.505

[cheering and applause]

35:22.989 --> 35:25.079
[laughter]

35:32.695 --> 35:34.349
All right.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.784
They smoked you guys
on the walk.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.570
- [laughter]
- All right, tonight

35:37.699 --> 35:40.572
you are playing Like Clockwork.

35:40.702 --> 35:43.489
As you can see, there are
two giant glass cases

35:43.619 --> 35:45.099
right here
in the middle of the Arena.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.971
One of you is gonna be placed

35:48.101 --> 35:49.798
inside this case.

35:49.929 --> 35:52.932
Now, on the floor,
there are six gear combinations.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.065
Only one of them works.

35:57.023 --> 35:58.807
It's your goal tonight
to figure out which one works

35:58.938 --> 36:01.768
and communicate that
to your partner

36:01.898 --> 36:05.423
so they can rebuild it
exactly on your board.

36:05.554 --> 36:06.989
Now, the whole time
that you're trying

36:07.121 --> 36:09.297
to figure this out,

36:09.427 --> 36:11.603
sand will be coming
from the ceiling,

36:11.733 --> 36:14.128
pouring down,
making it way more difficult

36:14.259 --> 36:15.869
for you to decide
which one's which.

36:15.998 --> 36:19.001
The first team to get
the right gear combination

36:19.132 --> 36:20.525
rebuilt on their board

36:20.655 --> 36:22.179
will win tonight's
elimination round

36:22.309 --> 36:23.920
and stay in the game.

36:24.050 --> 36:26.139
Also... you will receive

36:26.271 --> 36:28.141
the last life shield.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.623
- Oh...
- Oh, wow.

36:30.753 --> 36:33.277
Which means you are safe
from the next elimination.

36:33.407 --> 36:35.235
And you know what that means.

36:36.889 --> 36:38.673
That means I'll be
seeing you in the final.

36:38.804 --> 36:40.501
[applause]

36:40.632 --> 36:42.722
Oh, yeah, that's the news
we've been waiting on!

36:42.851 --> 36:45.027
- Whoo!
- Losing team goes home

36:45.159 --> 36:46.465
empty-handed.

36:46.594 --> 36:48.074
- Good luck, everyone.
- Thank you.

36:53.994 --> 36:56.561

to make it to a final,

36:56.692 --> 36:59.128
especially with Nehemiah
being my teammate,

36:59.260 --> 37:00.956
and it would just mean so much,

37:01.088 --> 37:03.351

I've kind of been on.

Black.

37:29.724 --> 37:31.204
So the yellow one
should have diamonds

37:31.335 --> 37:33.815
- and, like, triangles?
- I'm still on the first one.

37:33.947 --> 37:36.514
NEHEMIAH: Melinda is
my A-1 since Day One

37:36.644 --> 37:38.168
because we did
our original season together.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.735
I think that our team might be

37:40.867 --> 37:42.302
a little bit stronger
than everyone

37:42.434 --> 37:43.652
just because of the history

37:43.782 --> 37:45.610
that me and Melinda have
and the communication.

37:45.740 --> 37:48.090
Big yellow goes...
oh, okay, I see.

37:48.222 --> 37:50.528
- Big yellow where you have
the little yellow.
- Okay, I see.

37:50.659 --> 37:52.617
- No, this one goes--
- No, no, put

37:52.748 --> 37:53.748
the big yellow there.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.708
- Yeah, from there...
- Okay.

37:55.838 --> 37:57.623
...you're gonna take
the blue with a spiral.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.798
Is that a triangle?
Is that a triangle?

37:59.929 --> 38:01.583
- Yeah, it's a triangle.
- Triangle? Okay.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.411
Come on, Jasmine.
Come on, Jasmine.

38:03.541 --> 38:04.891
JONNA: Obviously
I'm rooting for Jasmine.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.719
She and I have done almost
every season together.

38:07.849 --> 38:09.809
Meanwhile,
Nehemiah and Melinda

38:09.938 --> 38:11.811
are kind of
a strong team, so...

38:11.940 --> 38:13.943
if somehow Jasmine
and Laterrian take them out,

38:14.074 --> 38:15.858
it'll be good for my team.

38:15.989 --> 38:18.818
In front of that one is
a blue-- a blue one

38:18.947 --> 38:20.862

like, triangle, like pizza.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.429

- Yep.
- That one's not working.

What do you mean?
No, it's more pieces.

38:27.914 --> 38:29.697

if they don't work?

38:29.829 --> 38:31.570
- There's six puzzles!
- What's the second one?

38:31.699 --> 38:33.440
The second one is
a blue one with triangles.

38:33.572 --> 38:34.920

where you have it.

38:35.050 --> 38:37.793

No-- no-no-no-no-no,

38:37.923 --> 38:40.492
no, no, not green,
put the black

38:40.621 --> 38:42.275
- underneath the blue--
- It doesn't fit.

38:42.407 --> 38:44.233
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, it doesn't fit.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.715
Laterrian is not hearing me,

38:46.846 --> 38:48.760
- and he's screaming at me.
- No-no-no!

38:48.891 --> 38:51.284
No-no, baby, no-no,
no-no-no-no-no, no!

38:51.416 --> 38:53.809
And I realize, okay,
you know what, he's in a box.

38:53.940 --> 38:56.507
He can't hear.
He's a little older.

38:56.637 --> 38:58.900
It happens.
Nothing wrong with that.

38:59.032 --> 39:00.902
Jasmine, tell him
to try another one.

39:01.034 --> 39:02.905
Doesn't work, hey, hey,
hold on, hold on, hold on--

39:03.036 --> 39:04.472
Let's do a different
puzzle, baby,

39:04.603 --> 39:06.300
because if
that's not working--

39:06.431 --> 39:08.041
- Yes, I'm going
to a different one.
- Okay.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.217
Going to a different one.
I want, I want...

39:10.347 --> 39:13.306
- uh, sand is
getting in my eyes.
- Okay, it's okay!

39:13.438 --> 39:15.961
I know Laterrian struggles
with communication,

39:16.092 --> 39:19.268
but I'm a mom; I know
how to talk through tantrums.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.793
This does not fit, okay?

39:21.923 --> 39:23.708
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

39:23.838 --> 39:24.884
Is there another one?
No, that's not--

39:25.014 --> 39:26.711
No, there's
only three black ones.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.277
So let's go
to a different answer key.

39:28.409 --> 39:30.411
All right.

39:30.541 --> 39:33.108
Big blue
next to the big black.

39:33.239 --> 39:34.545
You-- You got it on, right?

39:34.675 --> 39:36.635
No, it's not coming on.

39:36.764 --> 39:38.550
- Push it down.
- It doesn't fit.

In the great words of LT...

39:40.028 --> 39:42.597
all I wanna do is
put some hands on somebody.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.773
Well, LT, I'm sorry.

39:44.903 --> 39:46.340
You're gonna have
your hands full of sand

at keycodes right now.

39:48.559 --> 39:50.344

So this ends your time

my goal of making the final,
