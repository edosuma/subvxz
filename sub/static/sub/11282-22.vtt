00:01.435 --> 00:03.304
* Ay-oh, let's go...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.473
CHRIS ROCK:
Just about everything
I ever went through

00:05.506 --> 00:07.375
in school was hard.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.377
The work was tough.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.046
"Q"

00:12.080 --> 00:14.315
The people were mean.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.783
* They're going
through a tight one *

00:15.816 --> 00:17.251
Go ahead.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.120
* The kids are losing
their minds *

00:19.153 --> 00:22.090
* Blitzkrieg bop

00:22.123 --> 00:24.592
Are we having a fight
or a dance

00:24.625 --> 00:27.195
* Gonna raise steam heat

00:27.228 --> 00:29.663
You know
I can't dance.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.665
But the one thing
about school that was harder

00:31.699 --> 00:33.067
than anything else...

00:33.101 --> 00:35.536
Chris, wake up.
...was getting there.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.738
It's time to go to school.
You can't learn nothing in bed.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.340
Tell that to Kim Kardashian.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.543
* I don't know,
they're all revved up *

00:42.576 --> 00:44.245
While most people kids
were still sleeping,

00:44.278 --> 00:46.214
I had to get my clothes on,

00:46.247 --> 00:48.816
wash my face,
brush my teeth, eat...

00:48.849 --> 00:50.251
Hey-hey-hey!

00:50.284 --> 00:52.820
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!
Wait, wait!

00:52.853 --> 00:54.555
...and then catch three buses.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.094
If I got the first one
on time,

01:00.128 --> 01:02.730
it gave me just enough time
to catch the second one...

01:04.665 --> 01:07.735
which usually made me right
on time to catch the third one.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.807
And if nothing went wrong,
I'd be on time.

01:13.841 --> 01:14.842
Hey, Chris.

01:14.875 --> 01:15.676
Hey.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.445
After you.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.215
You're late.

01:21.249 --> 01:24.652
Now go to the principal's office
and get a tardy slip.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.358
Here.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.361
Just for the
record, Chris,

01:33.394 --> 01:34.662
you can't afford
to be late again.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.297
The clocks in this school
are set

01:36.330 --> 01:39.200
to Eastern Standard Time,
not CP time.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.234
What difference does it make
if I'm late?

01:40.268 --> 01:41.135
We took all our tests.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.803
We only got, like,
one more week to go.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.706
Counting today, you have been
late 29 times

01:45.739 --> 01:47.841
this year,
and 30 is the limit.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.243
If you're late again,

01:49.277 --> 01:50.878
you will not be promoted.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.713
You will have to repeat
the tenth grade.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.847
Say what?!

01:53.881 --> 01:54.915
Say word.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.418
Oh, there's a word I want
to say, all right.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.733
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.887
While I worried about
getting to school,

02:33.921 --> 02:37.191
Tonya was worried
about getting out of school.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.726
Boy, slow down!

02:38.759 --> 02:40.928
You're acting like your food
is trying to get away from you.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.196
I'm trying to get to bed.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.631
I'm really tired.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.632
Hey, Daddy,

02:44.665 --> 02:46.900
can I get my hair done
at Nessa's for graduation?

02:46.934 --> 02:47.935
Sure, baby.

02:47.968 --> 02:48.969
Can I get
a new dress, too?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.271
You don't need
a new dress.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.705
You can wear
your church dress.

02:51.739 --> 02:52.806
But I wore that
for Easter.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.342
If I wear it
for graduation,

02:54.375 --> 02:55.609
I'll look back
at the pictures,

02:55.643 --> 02:56.810
I won't know
what I'm remembering.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.446
You'll remember
that we couldn't afford

02:58.479 --> 03:01.515
to buy you
two dresses.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.683
Plus, in one of the pictures,

03:02.716 --> 03:03.917
you'll be holding
the chocolate bunny.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.786
Love you.
Good night.

03:05.819 --> 03:06.820
Good night.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.459
That's okay. I've been saving
up for this.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.761
How many times does a girl
graduate from sixth grade?

03:13.794 --> 03:15.529
In Bed-Stuy, five.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.430
Thanks, Daddy.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.299
What are you writing, Drew?

03:18.332 --> 03:19.667
It's a list of things

03:19.700 --> 03:20.868
I can do on Amateur Night
at The Apollo.

03:20.901 --> 03:21.869
I'm gonna try out.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.804
Drew, that's
a tough audience.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.739
You can't just go up there
and do anything.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.741
They will boo you faster
than Casper on Halloween.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.943
Stevie Wonder could see
before he did Amateur Night.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.545
They booed him blind.

03:31.579 --> 03:35.316
They booed Magic Johnson
so bad, he gave up singing.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.385
Magic Johnson is
a basketball player.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.986
Now.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.921
Well, they're not
gonna boo me.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.323
That's what Roseanne said

03:42.356 --> 03:44.492
before she sang
the national anthem.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.375
I made it on time.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.844
The joke was there was nothing
to be on time for.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.746
Good morning.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.750
Okay.

04:12.453 --> 04:17.558
Amy, Bethany...

04:17.591 --> 04:18.759
Bill...

04:18.792 --> 04:20.994
Bobby...

04:21.028 --> 04:22.763
Caroline...

04:22.796 --> 04:24.532
Chris...

04:24.565 --> 04:25.799
Here.

04:25.833 --> 04:26.867
David...

04:26.900 --> 04:28.702
Donna,

04:28.736 --> 04:31.905
You do realize no one's here
besides me?

04:31.939 --> 04:35.876
You think I want to be here
doing this, hmm?

04:35.909 --> 04:38.979
Last week of school,
everybody's out having a picnic,

04:39.012 --> 04:40.814
playing softball.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.050
But I gotta be here with you.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.586
So I'm gonna
take attendance.

04:45.619 --> 04:49.890
And you're gonna sit there
and you're gonna shut up.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.030
Frank, Garrett...

04:57.064 --> 05:00.334
Meanwhile, my father was
about to make a huge mistake.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.469
Hey, Pam.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.437
Oh, Julius, thank God.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.973
Why, what happened?
You hit the number again?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.541
No, I need $25.
See, I left my wallet at home,

05:07.575 --> 05:08.642
and I need to pick up
my dry cleaning

05:08.676 --> 05:11.445
Pam, you know how I feel
about lending people money.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.013
Like the Klan feels
about black people.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.982
Julius, you know
I'm good for it.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.450
You'll get it back
so quick,

05:16.484 --> 05:17.985
you won't even know
you gave it to me.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.853
Save yourself some time.
Don't give it to her.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.856
Didn't you hair
used to be yellow?

05:22.890 --> 05:23.957
That's blonde.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.926
My father used to say to me,

05:25.959 --> 05:27.595
"There's no such thing
as early.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.929
You're either on time or late."

05:28.962 --> 05:30.831
You waiting on the bus?

05:30.864 --> 05:31.732
Yeah.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.900
It was on time today.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.735
What do you mean?
It always comes at 7:22.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.003
It ain't supposed to.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.538
Supposed to come at 6:58.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.973
God!

05:44.111 --> 05:47.381
I'd been worried all week
about what would happen

05:47.415 --> 05:48.649
if one thing went wrong.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.983
I never considered what would
happen

05:50.017 --> 05:51.485
if everything went wrong.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.054
MAN :
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:54.087 --> 05:56.690
this car is now going express
to Far Rockaway.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.091
Far Rockaway?

05:58.125 --> 06:02.095
That's far out the way.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.997
Ten stops past
where I have to go.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.834
A wise man once said,
"Never challenge worse."

06:06.867 --> 06:10.070
I was a block away from school
with 60 seconds to make it.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.973
I didn't think things
could get worse. I was wrong.

06:21.515 --> 06:28.088
* Ball of confusion

06:28.121 --> 06:30.924
* That's what the world
is today *

06:30.958 --> 06:32.025
* Hey-hey

06:34.194 --> 06:37.498
* The sale of pills
are at an all-time high *

06:37.531 --> 06:40.434
* Young folks walking around
with their heads in the sky *

06:40.468 --> 06:43.036
* The cities ablaze
in the summertime *

06:43.070 --> 06:46.139
* And, oh, the beat goes on

06:52.580 --> 06:54.948
* Evolution, revolution,
gun control, sound of soul *

06:54.982 --> 06:59.052
* Shooting rockets to the moon,
kids growing up too soon *

06:59.086 --> 07:03.090
* Politicians say more taxes
will solve everything *

07:08.496 --> 07:13.033
* So, around and around
and around we go *

07:13.066 --> 07:14.167
* Where the world's headed...

07:14.201 --> 07:16.570
Oh, my God, my baby!

07:33.020 --> 07:35.188
Freeze!

07:35.222 --> 07:36.189
This the guy?

07:36.223 --> 07:38.125
The guy that what?
The guy who stole my car.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.627
I didn't...
Shut up.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.228
How tall are you?
I'm five-seven.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.063
I did not steal...
Shut up!

07:43.096 --> 07:44.898
No, I don't think it's him.

07:44.932 --> 07:45.899
Are you sure.
Take a closer look.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.735
He was wearing a mask.
He was wearing
a mask?

07:47.768 --> 07:48.569
He was wearing a mask.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.237
Cover your face.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.772
Not your eyes,
your mouth.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.074
What'd he say?
He said, "Give me your car.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.075
Say, "Give me your car."

07:55.108 --> 07:55.976
Give me your car.

07:56.009 --> 07:56.944
Give me your car!

07:56.977 --> 07:58.111
Give me your car.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.146
No.
That's not him?

07:59.179 --> 08:00.147
No.
Are you sure?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.214
Yeah.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.550
All right, beat it.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.228
You're late.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.664
Please, Mr. Thurman.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.198
Principal's office.
You're late.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.568
Mr. Thurman, please,
I can't be late.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.270
Then consider yourself early
for next year.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.614
Usually, my mother was my
judge, jury and executioner,

08:33.647 --> 08:35.115
but now she was my lawyer.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.551
Why does he have
to repeat the entire
tenth grade?

08:37.585 --> 08:39.753
Can't he just repeat
one day?

08:39.787 --> 08:41.589
Let me put it
in your vernacular.

08:41.622 --> 08:45.025
Rules is rules.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.159
What did you say?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.161
It's okay, Ma.
She does that.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.997
I'll explain it later.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.231
Well, I don't understand

08:51.264 --> 08:53.166
why you can't make an exception
for him

08:53.200 --> 08:55.135
I mean, didn't he pass
all his tests,

08:55.168 --> 08:56.837
including his finals?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.706
Yes,

08:58.739 --> 09:00.207
but this isn't about education.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.643
This is about punctuality.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.245
Look, could I appeal
to a higher authority

09:05.278 --> 09:07.280
and have Chris promoted
liked we did

09:07.314 --> 09:09.817
when the Vice Superintendent's
daughter got pregnant

09:09.850 --> 09:13.020
and missed
the entire tenth grade? Yes!

09:13.053 --> 09:16.957
But you don't really
want your son being coddled

09:16.990 --> 09:18.859
and helped through life
and all of its obstacles

09:18.892 --> 09:21.261
like some rich little
white girl, do you?

09:21.294 --> 09:23.363
Say yes, say yes!

09:23.396 --> 09:26.734
No. No, I guess you're right.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.301
I am.

09:28.335 --> 09:32.005
You may not realize
this now, Chris,

09:32.039 --> 09:33.106
but making you repeat
the tenth grade

09:33.140 --> 09:36.744
is the biggest favor
I'm ever going to do for you.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.014
While I was trying to make
the grade at Tattaglia,

09:41.048 --> 09:42.916
Drew was figuring out
how to make the cut.

09:42.950 --> 09:43.984
Amateur Night?

09:44.017 --> 09:45.018
Amateur Night?

09:45.052 --> 09:46.353
Are you crazy?

09:46.386 --> 09:47.688
Are you crazy?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.389
You know, the Pope came
to Harlem once.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.191
Tried to give mass
at the Apollo.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.392
Got booed off.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.861
Got booed off.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.228
Man, that crowd was tougher
than the Vietcong.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.330
Tougher than
the Vietcong.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.666
You know, we all performed
at the Apollo.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.233
Oh, yeah?
What'd you do?

10:00.267 --> 10:03.837
ALL:
Sang Luther Vandross'
"A House Is Not a Home."

10:03.871 --> 10:07.240
* A chair is still a chair

10:07.274 --> 10:10.177
Boo!
Get off
the stage!

10:10.210 --> 10:13.180
:
* Said when there's no one

10:13.213 --> 10:14.247
* Sitting

10:14.281 --> 10:17.350
* There-ee-er-ee-ere

10:17.384 --> 10:19.753
:
* But a

10:19.787 --> 10:21.388
* Chair

10:21.421 --> 10:25.425
* Is not a house

10:25.458 --> 10:29.362
* And a house is not a home

10:29.396 --> 10:33.333
* If there's no one there

10:33.366 --> 10:35.869
* To hold you tight

10:35.903 --> 10:38.305
* And no one there

10:38.338 --> 10:41.875
* You can kiss

10:41.909 --> 10:46.780
* Good night...

10:50.751 --> 10:55.388
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

11:03.163 --> 11:05.232
Wow! So, what happened?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.000
ALL:
Got booed off.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.802
He got booed off.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.805
Meanwhile, I was going down
like O.J. in the Vegas trial.

11:11.839 --> 11:12.840
Chris, this is
your own fault.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.842
If you would've told me
you were having problems,

11:14.875 --> 11:15.976
then I could've
done something.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.978
It's not the end
of the world.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.147
Most people don't get
to finish the tenth grade once.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.448
You get to do it twice.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.850
It's kind of like
working a double shift.

11:22.883 --> 11:26.053
Do you know how embarrassing
that's gonna to be?
As embarrassing

11:26.086 --> 11:28.155
as being 40 and still
living with your mother

11:28.188 --> 11:29.489
'cause you were too stupid
to listen to her

11:29.522 --> 11:31.324
and repeat the tenth grade
and get your diploma?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.793
Ma, if I'm late again,
I'm gonna be

11:32.826 --> 11:34.461
in the tenth grade
for the rest of my life.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.763
Then be on time.

11:35.796 --> 11:36.930
May I be excused?

11:36.964 --> 11:38.098
Yeah, go ahead.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.199
If you want to sulk,

11:39.232 --> 11:41.368
go sulk--it's not
gonna change anything.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.836
Ask Hillary Clinton.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.471
Drew, what's
taking you so long?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.410
Hey, Mom, come
look at my hair.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.946
Oh, that's nice!

11:52.980 --> 11:54.748
Vanessa better get
back here soon.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.216
You did a great job.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.085
I don't know,
I think

11:58.118 --> 12:00.087
it should cover
more of her face.
So, Julius,

12:00.120 --> 12:01.088
what do you think?

12:01.121 --> 12:02.122
Looks nice.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.323
Yeah, just wrap it up

12:03.356 --> 12:05.192
for the next couple
of nights-- it'll hold.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.494
That's what they told
Michael Jackson about his face.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.395
Go help your brother.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.197
So, how much do we owe you?

12:10.230 --> 12:13.033
Uh, with your discount, $25.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.468
Julius, pay her.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.171
Ooh, dinner smells good.

12:18.205 --> 12:21.274
Ooh, and lamb chops--
ooh, I love lamb chops.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.376
Well, Chris isn't hungry-- you
can have his plate if you want.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.444
Oh, thank you.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.145
You know, I had
reservations

12:25.178 --> 12:27.848
at Pastures and Shores, but, uh,

12:27.881 --> 12:29.449
now I can keep the money.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.384
You gonna do
something special with it?

12:31.418 --> 12:34.054
Like pay off some debts,
something like that?
No.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.223
See? That's the best thing
about having money is
I don't owe anybody.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.192
My father was trying
to get his cash out of Pam,

12:39.226 --> 12:42.996
and my mother was trying
to get me out of the house.
Chris, time to get up.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.867
I'm not going to school today.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.469
What's wrong

12:49.502 --> 12:51.071
No, I'm not sick.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.273
I'm dropping out.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.877
And in about an hour,
I'll be coming to.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.183
After my mother tried
knocking some sense into me,

13:03.216 --> 13:05.152
she tried to talk
some sense into me.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.987
Chris, I'm not
gonna sit back

13:07.020 --> 13:09.122
and watch you
throw your life away.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.557
Mom, you can't make me go.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.960
I did not spend all these
years trying to make sure...

13:12.993 --> 13:13.994
JULIUS:
He's right, Rochelle.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.096
We can't force him to go.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.399
But if you think you're
gonna sit around this house
all day, think again.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.102
If you don't go to
school, you go to work.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.437
Well, what kind of job
is he supposed to get

13:24.471 --> 13:25.538
with a tenth

13:25.572 --> 13:27.841
I don't know, ask George Bush.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.877
What's it gonna be, Chris?

13:35.615 --> 13:38.185
So that's it?
You're quitting school?

13:38.218 --> 13:40.120
Look, I'm not repeating
the tenth grade.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.621
I don't know what else to do.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.123
Well, have you thought
about a G.E.D?

13:43.156 --> 13:44.591
G.E.D.?

13:44.624 --> 13:46.326
In the job market,
it would put you

13:46.359 --> 13:47.594
on an equal level
with any ex-con.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.462
Except for the ones
who finished high school.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.631
I suppose it's
for the best, though.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.000
How's that?

13:53.033 --> 13:54.067
If you're a sophomore
and I'm a junior,

13:54.101 --> 13:55.969
there's no way I could ever
be seen with you again.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.105
I don't have any more
cool points to lose, dude.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.639
From the zero
you started out with.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.442
Hey, Kelly, Alex.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.878
So, is it true, you flunked out?

14:04.912 --> 14:06.046
I didn't flunk out.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.380
But I am leaving school.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.216
Cool. You want
to hang out sometime?

14:09.249 --> 14:10.250
You're kidding me, right?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.518
No, I mean, I've been

14:11.551 --> 14:14.121
beating the crap out of you all
these years, because secretly,

14:14.154 --> 14:15.555
I've been envious
of your determination

14:15.588 --> 14:16.389
and your accomplishments.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.391
I was only trying
to crush your spirit

14:18.425 --> 14:19.459
so I wouldn't feel inferior.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.061
But now that
you're dropping out,

14:21.094 --> 14:22.963
society will take over,
so we can hang.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.899
So, who are you gonna
pick on when I'm gone?

14:32.272 --> 14:33.606
Just give me a minute.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.443
All right, go ahead.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.114
While I was getting beat
by the system,

14:41.148 --> 14:43.183
Drew was drumming up
a new idea.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.352
Oh, yeah!

14:45.385 --> 14:46.987
Yeah!

14:47.020 --> 14:48.989
That's it!

14:53.626 --> 14:55.628
Oh, cool!

14:55.662 --> 14:58.631
While I was trying
to get a handle on my future,

14:58.665 --> 15:01.268
my father was trying
to get a handle on his cash.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.236
Hey, Julius, what are
you doing over here?

15:03.270 --> 15:05.172
You need a shave?
No.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.041
I need $25.
$25?

15:08.075 --> 15:09.542
I don't know, that's a lot.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.711
I'm not comfortable with
loaning out that kind of money.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.647
Neither was I when
I loaned it to you.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.516
Can I get my money back, please?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.251
Oh, my God,
I forgot all about that.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.519
How do you forget

15:19.552 --> 15:21.388
where you got some free money?

15:21.421 --> 15:24.357
How do you forget where
you got some free money?

15:24.391 --> 15:26.126
I found $20 dollars one time.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.460
I was on Flatbush Avenue

15:27.494 --> 15:29.362
in front of
the check cashing place.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.563
It was 5:07 p.m.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.698
on a Wednesday.

15:31.731 --> 15:32.499
64 degrees.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.634
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.369
I found a ten, a five,

15:36.403 --> 15:39.239
a two dollar bill,
two dollars and fifty
cents in quarters,

15:39.272 --> 15:40.974
three nickels and 25 pennies.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.675
One of them
was Canadian.
I'm sorry.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.144
Why didn't you
just say something?

15:44.177 --> 15:46.046
Why didn't you
just pay him back?

15:46.079 --> 15:48.481
Um, can I pay you back tomorrow?

15:48.515 --> 15:50.050
I left my wallet at home.

15:50.083 --> 15:53.053
You've got a cash register
right there.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.188
After all
my parents did for me,

15:55.222 --> 15:57.257
I tried to do
something for myself.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.625
G.E.D.?

15:58.658 --> 16:00.593
Yeah, it's just like
graduating from high school.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.694
No, it's not.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.531
Do you get
a G.E.D. cap and gown?

16:04.564 --> 16:06.299
Could people sign
your G.E.D. yearbook?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.368
Do they have a G.E.D. reunion?

16:08.401 --> 16:10.370
Yes, it's called
"Flavor of Love."

16:10.403 --> 16:12.605
Ma, a lot of people got
their G.E.D. and did fine.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.674
I looked it up.
Yeah

16:14.707 --> 16:17.177
Bill Cosby got a G.E.D.
So what,

16:17.210 --> 16:18.778
you want to be comedian? Ha!

16:18.811 --> 16:20.613
Very funny.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.415
Chris, is this
what you want to do?

16:22.449 --> 16:24.017
Yes.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.019
I'll make you all proud of me.
JULIUS:
Okay.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.687
As long as you're out
when you're 18.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.222
It'll be all right.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.690
If he doesn't
make us proud,

16:30.723 --> 16:32.425
I'll kill him,
and nobody'll ever know.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.661
While I was marching to the
beat of a different drummer,

16:34.694 --> 16:37.730
Drew was beating the odds
at the Apollo.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.175
MAN:
All right!

16:50.710 --> 16:52.745
MAN:
All right!

16:59.152 --> 17:01.054
Now, that boy is smart.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.623
I just knew he was
gonna get booed off,

17:03.656 --> 17:05.725
but everybody knows
you can't boo kids

17:05.758 --> 17:08.061
and you can't boo God. Mm!

17:08.095 --> 17:11.631
At least he's not singing
"A House Is Not a Home."

17:11.664 --> 17:13.500
What are you doing?

17:13.533 --> 17:17.270
I'm singing "A House
Is Not a Home."

17:17.304 --> 17:19.506
After Drew got
his standing ovation,

17:19.539 --> 17:21.774
Tonya got one, too.
Congratulations.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.278
Hi, baby!

17:25.312 --> 17:26.713
That's my daughter.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.115
That's my daughter.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.782
After taking the G.E.D.,

17:29.816 --> 17:32.452
I wasn't sure
if I had passed or failed,

17:32.485 --> 17:34.787
but I knew
there was no turning back.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.489
Pencils down.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.330
Next to a pregnancy scare,

17:43.363 --> 17:45.732
waiting for the results
from my G.E.D.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.635
was one of the scariest
moments of my life.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.839
* Clouds change the scene

17:52.872 --> 17:55.208
* Rain starts a-washing

17:55.242 --> 17:58.345
* All these cautions

17:58.378 --> 18:00.180
* Into your life

18:01.214 --> 18:03.850
Who gets that
fried crust?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.720
* Just what is true...

18:07.754 --> 18:09.756
*

18:16.563 --> 18:18.731
(Bon Jovi's
"Living on a Prayer" playing)

18:29.609 --> 18:31.611
*

18:36.849 --> 18:38.518
Hi, baby.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.353
Hey. Where's
Drew and Tonya?

18:40.387 --> 18:43.190
They're walking
over from Doc's.

18:43.223 --> 18:46.293
CHRIS :
* Tommy used to work
on the docks *

18:46.326 --> 18:47.460
There you go.
Thank you.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.196
* Union's been on strike

18:49.229 --> 18:50.830
* He's down on his luck

18:50.863 --> 18:53.466
* It's tough

18:54.667 --> 18:56.669
* So tough

18:58.738 --> 19:00.840
* Gina works the diner

19:00.873 --> 19:03.210
Hey!
Hi, Mom.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.811
I want fried crusts.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.846
Don't fill up on it.

19:06.879 --> 19:07.714
Where's Daddy?

19:07.747 --> 19:09.616
DREW:
In his skin--
when he jumps out,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.584
you can jump in.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.288
* She says, "We gotta

19:15.322 --> 19:16.756
:
* Hold on

19:16.789 --> 19:18.825
* To what we've got

19:18.858 --> 19:20.760
* 'Cause it doesn't
make a difference *

19:20.793 --> 19:22.795
* If we make or not

19:22.829 --> 19:24.664
* We got each other

19:24.697 --> 19:26.466
* And that's a lot

19:26.499 --> 19:28.368
* For love

19:28.401 --> 19:30.770
* We'll give it a shot

19:30.803 --> 19:32.705
* Oh...

19:32.739 --> 19:34.741
* We're halfway there

19:34.774 --> 19:36.576
* Oh, oh

19:36.609 --> 19:38.545
* Livin' on a prayer

19:38.578 --> 19:40.247
* Take my hand

19:40.280 --> 19:42.582
* We'll make it, I swear

19:42.615 --> 19:43.883
* Oh, oh

19:43.916 --> 19:46.753
* Livin' on a prayer

19:50.457 --> 19:52.792
* Tommy's got
his six-string in hock *

19:52.825 --> 19:55.595
* Now, he's holding in

19:55.628 --> 19:56.896
Ma, I heard they were hiring
at Red Lobster.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.665
They're not hiring you.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.967
