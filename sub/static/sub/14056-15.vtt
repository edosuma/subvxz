WEBVTT

00:00.088 --> 00:01.292
Previously on The O.C.

00:01.383 --> 00:02.365
Well, why wouldn't she date him?

00:02.454 --> 00:03.344
He's using her.

00:03.427 --> 00:04.998
Her father's the head of the board.

00:05.078 --> 00:06.411
When I'm not around you, I miss you.

00:06.504 --> 00:07.242
You do?

00:07.344 --> 00:08.924
That was Save The Last Dance, huh?

00:09.026 --> 00:11.674
That dance number at the end was so inspiring.

00:11.709 --> 00:12.231
Eww.

00:12.260 --> 00:15.110
Me and you, we got unfinished business.

00:15.191 --> 00:15.965
Where's Kaitlin?

00:16.053 --> 00:16.915
You're in love with her.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.492
Just be careful of that girl, man.

00:18.593 --> 00:19.610
I love you.

00:19.769 --> 00:20.930
And I think you love me, too.

00:21.024 --> 00:22.557
I need to know how you feel about Johnny.

00:22.661 --> 00:23.611
I'm with you.

00:23.709 --> 00:24.776
But that's not the whole story, is it?

00:24.867 --> 00:26.759
Just come down, Johnny, please.

00:26.843 --> 00:28.212
Okay, just be careful, all right?

00:28.360 --> 00:29.094
Johnny!

00:39.632 --> 00:42.354
Well, you know what they say, no news is good news.

00:42.452 --> 00:44.959
I'm not sure that's true about severe head injuries.

00:45.382 --> 00:47.029
We should have stayed at the hospital.

00:47.116 --> 00:48.584
There's nothing we could do there.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.594
Doctors told us to go home, sleep, eat.

00:51.704 --> 00:55.015
Yeah, except I can't sleep and I'm definitely not hungry.

00:55.316 --> 00:56.269
Hungry?

00:56.382 --> 00:57.849
Come on, everyone needs to eat.

00:57.931 --> 00:59.724
Your friend Johnny's gonna need you when he wakes up.

00:59.819 --> 01:00.652
If he wakes up.

01:00.757 --> 01:01.288
Marissa...

01:01.394 --> 01:02.547
You were there.

01:02.780 --> 01:03.967
Yeah, I was.

01:05.111 --> 01:07.473
You guys, he's probably gonna be fine.

01:07.594 --> 01:10.714
Trey was unconscious for, like, months and he was fine.

01:10.807 --> 01:11.731
He was shot.

01:11.831 --> 01:16.916
Yeah, we waited around like this once before after a certain OD in TJ.

01:17.530 --> 01:20.715
I'm going to, um... go check on Kaitlin in the pool house.

01:25.271 --> 01:26.257
How you doing, Ryan?

01:26.344 --> 01:27.359
She's right.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.838
I mean, the way the doctors were talking, you could tell.

01:31.020 --> 01:32.285
They didn't want to get our hopes up.

01:32.386 --> 01:34.237
Yeah, well, doctors are idiots.

01:34.351 --> 01:35.778
You tell that to your dad?

01:36.097 --> 01:37.667
It's their job to be negative.

01:37.755 --> 01:39.603
It's called managing expectations.

01:39.714 --> 01:41.734
That's why it's our job to be positive.

01:46.211 --> 01:47.231
Johnny's mom.

01:47.337 --> 01:49.194
- You think you ought to...?
- I don't know.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.603
Do you want me to?

01:51.476 --> 01:53.041
No, no, it's all right.

01:56.694 --> 01:57.814
Mrs. Harper?

01:58.378 --> 01:59.581
Hi, it's Ryan.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.695
What happened?

03:29.267 --> 03:30.282
Hey.

03:32.006 --> 03:33.021
Thanks for coming by.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.115
No, I'm glad you called.

03:44.680 --> 03:45.701
Where's Gwen?

03:47.276 --> 03:48.690
I finally got her to lie down.

03:48.736 --> 03:52.045
She started talking about the funeral and just lost it, you know?

03:52.146 --> 03:53.874
Well, what does she want to do?

03:54.002 --> 03:55.263
Who knows?

03:55.715 --> 03:59.493
She said no priest, no body, nothing depressing.

03:59.579 --> 04:02.056
I mean, it's a funeral, you know. Isn't it supposed to be depressing?

04:02.169 --> 04:05.572
Well, I mean, we could do something during the day.

04:05.826 --> 04:07.787
You know, maybe by the water.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.265
No one allowed to wear black.

04:09.378 --> 04:10.605
Or shoes.

04:13.435 --> 04:15.469
It sounds like what he'd want to do.

04:17.569 --> 04:19.017
I got to take this to Mrs. H.

04:19.108 --> 04:20.301
Hey, I'll do it.

04:21.603 --> 04:22.529
Thanks.

04:22.825 --> 04:24.494
It doesn't seem real, man.

04:25.075 --> 04:27.814
Listen, man, you can't blame yourself. You tried.

04:27.987 --> 04:29.511
Yeah, and I failed.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.215
Well, don't beat yourself up.

04:32.382 --> 04:35.193
Ryan Atwood versus himself is a very ugly cage match.

04:35.298 --> 04:37.174
I'm going to shower, try and get some sleep.

04:38.568 --> 04:40.263
So I guess you won't have to worry about Johnny coming

04:40.345 --> 04:43.392
between you and Marissa anymore, because...

04:43.687 --> 04:47.331
Sudoku, fun to say, fun to do...

04:47.933 --> 04:50.107
Too soon? Okay.

04:50.888 --> 04:52.297
Too soon.

04:53.535 --> 04:56.005
This just feels wrong.

04:56.098 --> 05:00.271
The kids are going through this awful thing and we're planning a Valentine's Day dance.

05:00.379 --> 05:03.604
All the more reason for them to focus on something good.

05:03.717 --> 05:08.298
I mean, it's not like we can cancel this dance now, if we wanted to.

05:08.397 --> 05:12.008
Although... the thought had crossed my mind.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.113
He hasn't asked you?

05:13.224 --> 05:14.827
Who? Dr. Neil Roberts?

05:14.945 --> 05:16.823
Why, no, he hasn't.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.835
Do you think he has plans with someone else?

05:18.941 --> 05:19.271
No.

05:19.367 --> 05:21.163
-  That I'm not Valentine material?
- Julie.

05:21.276 --> 05:25.201
That I'm just a fun hang, not worthy of chocolates, flowers, and nice underwear.

05:25.302 --> 05:27.856
Well, Sandy's no fan of Valentine's Day.

05:27.958 --> 05:30.307
I guess we should concentrate on hosting a great event,

05:30.393 --> 05:32.383
and we'll worry about our love lives when it's over.

05:32.490 --> 05:37.213
Or I could invent a fake reason to go to his house and fish for information.

05:37.276 --> 05:41.644
Julie, last time you went on a stealth mission, you toppled the dessert tray.

05:42.721 --> 05:44.403
Yeah, but it got his attention.

05:46.169 --> 05:47.059
Thank you.

05:51.657 --> 05:52.431
Hi.

05:52.623 --> 05:53.959
Are you a friend of Johnny's?

05:55.108 --> 05:57.243
I'm his cousin, Sadie.

05:57.443 --> 06:00.029
Hi. I'm glad you're here.

06:00.258 --> 06:02.618
My mom thought it would be a good idea if I came down here

06:02.709 --> 06:04.394
and stayed with my aunt for a while.

06:04.615 --> 06:05.811
How's she doing?

06:06.634 --> 06:09.161
Not so good, you know, but finally sleeping.

06:09.259 --> 06:11.502
You look like you could use a few hours yourself.

06:11.633 --> 06:14.093
Oh, I'm... I'm okay.

06:14.202 --> 06:15.381
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:15.493 --> 06:18.125
I  should probably go. I just got a lot of stuff to do.

06:18.475 --> 06:19.962
Hey, are you Marissa?

06:22.428 --> 06:23.181
Yeah.

06:23.274 --> 06:27.593
Well, I wish it was under better circumstances, but, um, it's nice to finally meet you.

06:29.335 --> 06:30.252
You, too.

06:47.860 --> 06:50.380
Justin, what are you doing here?

06:50.499 --> 06:52.100
Winter break is almost over.

06:52.198 --> 06:54.112
I thought you might want a ride back to school.

06:54.217 --> 06:55.649
You should have saved your gas money.

06:55.767 --> 06:57.211
It's a hybrid.

06:57.324 --> 07:00.388
It gets pretty good mileage, so gas isn't an issue.

07:00.494 --> 07:03.006
Last time you came to town, you wanted me arrested.

07:03.117 --> 07:07.825
That was my brother, and I was thinking, I was hoping that we could talk.

07:08.217 --> 07:09.806
About our relationship?

07:10.386 --> 07:12.003
Our relationship?

07:13.938 --> 07:15.437
Today's not a good day.

07:15.556 --> 07:16.898
Is there another day that would be better?

07:17.001 --> 07:18.936
I want you to leave right now.

07:19.031 --> 07:20.178
Kaitlin, are you okay?

07:25.150 --> 07:26.671
I'll see you then. Thanks.

07:28.478 --> 07:29.595
- Hey, boss.
- Hey.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.424
You wanted to see me?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.122
Yeah, I just got off the phone with Dr. Griffin,

07:32.211 --> 07:34.857
and he told me that the board has vetted the Brea proposal,

07:34.947 --> 07:36.574
and they're ready to put a hole in the ground.

07:36.672 --> 07:38.663
But I'm going to meet with them one more time.

07:38.771 --> 07:40.586
Do you think you could call Maya?

07:41.027 --> 07:43.386
I mean, with a few caveats?

07:43.497 --> 07:44.059
Name them.

07:44.161 --> 07:46.395
Don't lie. Don't lead her on.

07:46.494 --> 07:47.575
That's not a problem.

07:48.090 --> 07:51.432
I mean, the reason I went out with her when she called, is actually I really like her.

07:51.533 --> 07:53.788
Oh, boy likes girl.

07:53.912 --> 07:58.134
Girl has access to influential father. Boy's boss needs to close a deal.

07:58.246 --> 08:00.617
Has all the makings of a great romance.

08:00.709 --> 08:01.946
I'm glad you like her.

08:02.068 --> 08:03.336
Well, I'll give her a call.

08:03.451 --> 08:04.576
Let you know.

08:07.167 --> 08:09.134
- Hey, Marissa.
- Hi.

08:09.791 --> 08:10.866
Marissa.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.297
How  you holding up?

08:15.419 --> 08:16.345
I'm okay.

08:16.483 --> 08:21.090
I was wondering. There's all these forms from the hospital, and,

08:21.250 --> 08:23.706
well, Johnny's mom can't really deal right now.

08:23.825 --> 08:25.246
It doesn't need a lawyer or anything...

08:25.338 --> 08:27.951
You know what, I actually know just the guy for the job.

08:28.087 --> 08:30.011
I practically majored in paperwork.

08:30.374 --> 08:31.566
Are you sure you don't mind?

08:31.663 --> 08:35.621
When it comes to mind-numbing bureaucratic busy work, Matt is an ace.

08:35.741 --> 08:37.448
And here I thought you never noticed.

08:37.715 --> 08:41.456
All right, well, uh, I should get home, you know, shower.

08:41.565 --> 08:44.776
I've been in these clothes since you don't want to know when.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.220
I think you're doing great, kiddo.

08:48.555 --> 08:49.217
Thanks.

08:52.259 --> 08:53.518
Oh, hey.

08:53.614 --> 08:54.765
Hey, what are you doing?

08:54.967 --> 08:57.486
Uh, nothing.

08:57.641 --> 09:01.002
Oh, well, if it's nothing, then you won't mind me looking, right?

09:02.061 --> 09:03.452
That's not porn.

09:03.582 --> 09:08.727
It's a list of my Yakuza DVDs sorted alphabetically by title and also by director.

09:08.844 --> 09:11.687
Making my inventories is sort of one of those things,

09:11.786 --> 09:13.792
kind of like masturbating or flossing my teeth,

09:13.897 --> 09:17.239
where even though you know I do it, I'd just rather you not witness it.

09:17.318 --> 09:20.556
Cohen... I found something in your drawer.

09:22.571 --> 09:24.240
You're not mad?

09:25.088 --> 09:27.703
Oh, no, I'm mad. I'm livid.

09:27.808 --> 09:30.681
Not about the pot, because, I mean, whatever, it's pot, right?

09:30.767 --> 09:33.238
And while Marissa and I were hotboxing Luke's car,

09:33.340 --> 09:36.309
you were at home making a manger for Captain Oats out of Lincoln Logs.

09:36.463 --> 09:38.466
So, you were a late bloomer, and I get that,

09:38.507 --> 09:44.355
but, Cohen, you lied to me for, like, the gazillionth time about something important.

09:44.484 --> 09:47.799
Well, Summer, I don't know what I can do, except say I'm not going to lie again,

09:47.890 --> 09:51.162
and then not lie. You just have to trust me.

09:51.259 --> 09:52.621
Yeah, well, I don't.

09:52.862 --> 09:54.779
So you better think of something else.

10:00.005 --> 10:01.926
What happened to the crockpot?

10:02.554 --> 10:03.806
It broke.

10:05.884 --> 10:07.091
Hi. Hey.

10:07.157 --> 10:07.960
Hi.

10:09.052 --> 10:10.927
Let me give you guys some privacy.

10:11.056 --> 10:12.204
That's all right, you don't...

10:13.581 --> 10:15.470
I've tried talking to her.

10:15.603 --> 10:17.580
Well, give her some time. How are you doing?

10:18.212 --> 10:19.304
You know?

10:22.694 --> 10:24.449
Hi, Mrs. Harper.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.863
Uh, sorry, hi.

10:29.487 --> 10:32.584
Yeah, I guess. Sure.

10:41.156 --> 10:42.142
Hi.

10:42.328 --> 10:43.354
Hey.

10:44.405 --> 10:45.858
Thanks for meeting me.

10:46.751 --> 10:48.750
Sure. No problem.

10:50.076 --> 10:52.258
So, uh, you're visiting.

10:52.355 --> 10:54.457
Yeah, from Ashland, Oregon.

10:54.598 --> 10:56.324
You taking some time off school, or...?

10:56.415 --> 10:58.386
No, actually, I just graduated.

10:58.521 --> 11:02.278
I started my own little jewelry making business, so...

11:02.385 --> 11:05.481
I've just been traveling, trying to get stores to carry my stuff.

11:07.762 --> 11:11.719
You know, I really need to be with my boyfriend right now.

11:11.826 --> 11:13.018
Your boyfriend?

11:13.233 --> 11:14.888
Yeah, Ryan.

11:15.113 --> 11:18.091
He was with me, with Johnny, when it happened.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.599
Oh, yeah, my aunt mentioned that there was another kid there.

11:20.651 --> 11:22.424
I just thought, um...

11:23.082 --> 11:26.042
this is really awkward, I thought that Johnny was your boyfriend.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.438
Why would you think that?

11:29.096 --> 11:32.969
Because last week he called me and he asked me if I would make something for you.

11:33.009 --> 11:34.689
For Valentine's Day.

11:34.883 --> 11:36.638
Here, I brought it with me.

11:39.117 --> 11:43.765
There is your birthstone and that's his, and in the middle there's an angel.

11:46.405 --> 11:47.248
An angel?

11:47.347 --> 11:49.777
Yeah, he was afraid you might think it was cheesy,

11:49.867 --> 11:52.845
but he said that's what you were to him.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.544
So Johnny had this pair of Power Ranger pajamas

12:57.642 --> 13:00.184
that he absolutely refused to take off.

13:00.291 --> 13:03.656
I mean, he would literally wake up in the morning

13:03.753 --> 13:05.980
and put his clothes on top of his pajamas.

13:06.081 --> 13:09.221
And he'd go about his day wearing his two layers of clothing.

13:30.741 --> 13:33.026
Ryan, there's Kaitlin.

13:34.862 --> 13:37.780
- I should probably...
- No, it's all right, let me.

13:40.780 --> 13:44.552
Hey. What are you doing up here alone?

13:44.639 --> 13:46.581
What am I supposed to do?

13:46.704 --> 13:49.375
Just go down there and introduce myself?

13:49.884 --> 13:53.104
"Hey, I'm Kaitlin. The girl who killed him."

13:53.750 --> 13:56.714
You didn't make him climb that rock, and you didn't make him fall.

13:56.839 --> 13:58.004
That's right...

13:58.743 --> 14:00.051
that was you.

14:02.269 --> 14:04.667
You know what, I'm not going to do this with you.

14:04.797 --> 14:06.057
Everybody's upset. Come on.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.771
No, you know what, Ryan?

14:07.987 --> 14:09.737
You can't fix this.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.737
So  just save the speeches for my sister, all right?

14:15.205 --> 14:16.938
All right, here you go.

14:17.047 --> 14:19.116
This is your fourth quarter bonus, by the way.

14:19.216 --> 14:21.321
Next time, I pick the sport.

14:21.463 --> 14:24.285
Hey, did you ever get in touch with Maya?

14:24.992 --> 14:28.007
Yeah, but I kind of wish I didn't.

14:28.122 --> 14:31.420
You see, when I didn't call her back, she took that as a sign of my lack of interest.

14:31.515 --> 14:34.958
And she's a smart girl, and now she's an angry one, too.

14:35.056 --> 14:38.772
It's not a typo. I need 10,000 cinnamon hearts, and please don't make them stale.

14:38.876 --> 14:39.911
Thanks.

14:40.127 --> 14:41.612
Hey, honey, are the kids home?

14:41.708 --> 14:44.286
No, they're on the way to the Bait Shop for the wake.

14:44.389 --> 14:45.662
Hey, Matt, how's it going?

14:45.772 --> 14:46.712
Women troubles.

14:46.831 --> 14:49.138
Oh, well, maybe I can play Cupid.

14:49.851 --> 14:50.859
That's a great idea.

14:50.972 --> 14:51.945
Really, Sandy?

14:52.070 --> 14:54.004
And what is it that you say about Valentine's Day?

14:54.123 --> 14:57.367
That it's vacuous, a commercially-driven hollow shell of a holiday?

14:57.478 --> 15:00.592
Well, sometimes we all need a little vacuous, commercially-driven diversion,

15:00.682 --> 15:02.195
and this would be one of those times.

15:02.287 --> 15:04.482
What's her name? I'll have a ticket to the party delivered.

15:04.582 --> 15:05.645
It's Maya Griffin.

15:05.742 --> 15:08.815
Whose father is the head of the Physician's Board?

15:09.802 --> 15:10.364
I don't know.

15:10.469 --> 15:11.760
If anybody can do it, you can.

15:11.877 --> 15:14.874
This girl doesn't need my help getting a date. It'll never work.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.864
You know what, Kirsten, don't worry about it.

15:16.970 --> 15:19.507
I'm sure that we can come up with something else.

15:21.739 --> 15:25.802
I'll get Maya to the party, if you try and embrace the holiday.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.948
No whining, no snarky comments.

15:28.049 --> 15:29.876
Candies, candles, lingerie.

15:29.981 --> 15:32.591
Nice lingerie, nothing red,

15:32.837 --> 15:35.075
see-through or remotely edible.

15:35.175 --> 15:37.171
Not even a little see-through?

15:44.012 --> 15:46.948
Death and Valentine's Day. There's an unbeatable combination.

15:47.048 --> 15:50.111
Yeah, this is the first one where Marissa and I are actually together.

15:50.222 --> 15:51.568
Should be all time.

15:51.692 --> 15:53.654
Pressure's on for me to deliver.

15:53.791 --> 15:55.295
Summer found my stash.

15:55.428 --> 15:58.368
You don't have any visible bruises. She go for the kidneys?

15:58.486 --> 15:59.673
I wish.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.932
You and Atwood make V-day plans?

16:02.550 --> 16:04.819
Actually, we haven't even talked about it.

16:04.903 --> 16:05.929
Really?

16:06.132 --> 16:11.037
It's the first Valentine's Day that you guys aren't fighting or kissing another girl.

16:11.147 --> 16:12.400
It could be special.

16:13.010 --> 16:14.376
This is special.

16:17.047 --> 16:20.188
All I'm saying is Valentine's Day might be canceled this year.

16:28.902 --> 16:30.109
Hey, Sadie.

16:31.637 --> 16:32.493
What do you want?

16:32.609 --> 16:34.649
I just want to see how you're doing.

16:35.642 --> 16:37.008
I mean it, okay?

16:37.115 --> 16:39.220
When  was the last time you meant anything you said?

16:39.358 --> 16:40.685
Is there a problem here?

16:41.038 --> 16:42.123
Hey, man.

16:42.322 --> 16:43.746
This is a private party.

16:44.021 --> 16:45.957
It's  okay, he was just leaving.

16:46.328 --> 16:47.510
Yeah.

16:50.065 --> 16:51.100
So you know him?

16:51.881 --> 16:52.876
Used to.

16:54.520 --> 16:55.595
Sadie, right?

16:57.844 --> 16:59.839
I liked what you said at the beach today.

17:00.375 --> 17:01.126
Thanks.

17:01.432 --> 17:04.261
Speaking at funerals is something of a specialty.

17:04.374 --> 17:06.294
Not that it's anything to brag about.

17:06.468 --> 17:10.037
No one close to me has ever... ever died.

17:10.151 --> 17:11.298
Really?

17:12.176 --> 17:14.256
It feels like everyone close to me has.

17:14.983 --> 17:20.579
I mean, not everyone, but my dad-- cancer when I was 14.

17:21.078 --> 17:23.798
My dog Rocky, like, a month after that.

17:24.362 --> 17:25.964
My best friend last summer.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.154
I'm sorry.

17:27.844 --> 17:29.495
For your cousin, too.

17:29.598 --> 17:30.813
I see that.

17:32.756 --> 17:35.981
It's a funeral. People say sorry before they say hello.

17:36.683 --> 17:38.837
But you really are, so thank you.

17:39.759 --> 17:40.960
Ryan, there you are.

17:41.004 --> 17:41.757
Hey.

17:41.883 --> 17:43.616
- Hey, Marissa.
- Hi.

17:43.901 --> 17:46.762
So Seth and Summer were looking for you at the car.

17:46.876 --> 17:48.197
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

17:48.266 --> 17:51.330
So maybe we'll see you again before you leave?

17:51.441 --> 17:52.498
Sure.

18:00.417 --> 18:05.454
Yes, well, I think I might have left it somewhere around here at Kaitlin's birthday party.

18:05.937 --> 18:07.740
Well, I haven't seen a cake knife anywhere,

18:07.831 --> 18:09.551
not that I'd know what a cake knife looks like.

18:09.658 --> 18:12.059
And are you really going to be baking?

18:12.148 --> 18:14.617
Don't you have your Valentine's party tomorrow night?

18:14.719 --> 18:20.661
Frankly, Neil, I'm surprise you remembered at my little dance or Valentine's Day.

18:22.252 --> 18:24.866
So are you working this weekend on call?

18:24.965 --> 18:26.070
You're such a busy man.

18:26.175 --> 18:29.471
No, I thought that I'd stay in and catch up on some reading.

18:29.591 --> 18:31.341
Oh. Because you're behind on work.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.427
There must be new techniques developed every day.

18:33.523 --> 18:34.400
Got to keep up.

18:34.507 --> 18:37.502
No, I thought I would get into The Da Vinci Code.

18:39.499 --> 18:40.866
Have you read it?

18:40.969 --> 18:42.711
I'm waiting for the movie.

18:44.575 --> 18:47.678
Well, I don't see that knife anywhere.

18:47.786 --> 18:49.427
I suppose I should be going.

18:49.525 --> 18:52.741
Well, it's always good to see you, Julie.

18:52.858 --> 18:53.933
I'll see you out.

18:54.044 --> 18:55.033
It's okay.

18:55.230 --> 18:57.717
I, I, uh, I know the way.

19:07.825 --> 19:08.752
Hey.

19:12.798 --> 19:14.338
Happy Valentine's Day.

19:16.454 --> 19:18.474
I figured you could use something to hug.

19:20.996 --> 19:24.163
Or at least if you throw him he won't break.

19:29.954 --> 19:31.024
Trouble at home?

19:31.378 --> 19:32.943
Shockingly, no.

19:33.729 --> 19:34.885
It's a boy.

19:36.423 --> 19:38.938
I mean, not like that.

19:40.632 --> 19:41.690
He...

19:43.007 --> 19:44.209
he died.

19:46.432 --> 19:48.812
And I was with him.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.595
And sort of helped it happen.

19:53.191 --> 19:54.420
What do you mean?

19:55.299 --> 20:00.103
We went to the beach, drinking, a bonfire,

20:00.218 --> 20:01.766
I thought it'd be fun.

20:02.044 --> 20:04.118
But he was really messed up.

20:04.248 --> 20:07.139
And by the time I called for help, it was too late.

20:08.958 --> 20:12.211
He slipped, fell on some rocks.

20:13.249 --> 20:14.653
Then it was an accident.

20:14.764 --> 20:17.109
Yeah, but accidents don't just happen.

20:17.222 --> 20:19.149
People let them happen.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.845
I understand why it probably feels that way,

20:25.972 --> 20:28.970
but I'm sure if he were here, he'd be the first to take responsibility,

20:29.069 --> 20:32.461
and he'd thank you for trying to help him.

20:35.292 --> 20:37.114
You're like an adult.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.540
My parents are therapists.

20:39.838 --> 20:42.318
They're annoying, but pretty smart.

20:42.718 --> 20:45.028
Well, thank you.

20:46.488 --> 20:49.430
So I will see you back at Santa Barbara?

20:50.006 --> 20:50.964
Yeah.

20:51.159 --> 20:52.076
Okay.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.228
Bye.

21:04.447 --> 21:07.156
Dude, I can totally see you.

21:07.278 --> 21:09.328
Dude, right.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.230
Hey.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.810
How was the uh, how was the memorial?

21:25.939 --> 21:26.776
Can we talk about something else?

21:26.886 --> 21:29.420
Like why you're reading the Victoria's Secret catalog?

21:29.525 --> 21:32.119
You know what, speaking of underwear, I think I have sand in mine.

21:32.217 --> 21:33.145
Excuse me.

21:33.939 --> 21:38.394
Well, no, your mother gave it to me, with items marked and sizes circled.

21:38.497 --> 21:40.391
Does that mean you're embracing Valentine's Day this year?

21:40.494 --> 21:42.009
Yeah, I thought you weren't a fan.

21:42.123 --> 21:45.471
No, I made a deal with your mother, and I'm holding up my end of the bargain.

21:46.117 --> 21:47.473
God. Wow.

21:47.571 --> 21:50.159
It's just, like, what's even the point almost, you know?

21:50.274 --> 21:51.859
I'm going to have to borrow that later.

21:51.959 --> 21:52.639
Thanks.

21:52.740 --> 21:55.629
Uh... we'll see.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.543
So what do you want to do?

21:59.057 --> 22:00.471
I'm doing it.

22:01.565 --> 22:04.202
I mean tomorrow, for Valentine's Day.

22:04.683 --> 22:07.005
Can we talk about tomorrow tomorrow?

22:07.098 --> 22:08.831
Not if you want to do something.

22:11.077 --> 22:12.733
I don't want to do anything.

22:17.631 --> 22:20.646
You mean you don't want to do anything specific, or

22:20.781 --> 22:22.306
you don't want to do anything at all?

22:22.416 --> 22:24.714
Ryan, you've never liked Valentine's Day before.

22:24.820 --> 22:27.422
Okay? So don't suddenly act like it's your favorite holiday.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.158
I'm not.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.546
This is just really hard for me, okay?

22:31.665 --> 22:33.336
Yeah, well, it's hard for me, too.

22:36.024 --> 22:37.806
- I can't explain it.
- I was there, Marissa.

22:37.894 --> 22:39.856
What is it you think I don't understand?

22:41.482 --> 22:42.688
I'm going to go.

22:50.839 --> 22:51.753
Come in.

22:55.132 --> 22:58.588
So your girlfriend decided to cancel Valentine's Day, huh?

22:58.871 --> 23:01.925
Small town. Very good cell service.

23:02.099 --> 23:04.322
Well, yesterday it seemed like we were having a good day.

23:04.449 --> 23:05.552
At a funeral?

23:05.678 --> 23:08.117
Not a good day but, you know, we were good.

23:08.232 --> 23:09.483
Then she just kind of freaked out.

23:09.601 --> 23:11.674
Well, sudden death can do odd things to people.

23:11.783 --> 23:13.587
Remember my mom at Caleb's wake?

23:13.699 --> 23:14.656
That was Kirsten's dad.

23:14.774 --> 23:16.217
Johnny was Marissa's friend.

23:16.313 --> 23:17.384
Her good friend.

23:17.498 --> 23:18.650
Too good.

23:18.797 --> 23:24.203
Well, the guy's dead, Ryan. I think you can cut Marissa at least a weekend's worth of slack.

23:24.699 --> 23:27.091
She told me flat out she didn't want to see me today.

23:27.191 --> 23:30.088
Ignore her. She was out of her mind with exhaustion and grief.

23:30.187 --> 23:30.924
Seemed pretty lucid to me.

23:31.025 --> 23:33.989
Trust me, man. No girl wants to be alone on Valentine's Day.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.152
And you know this because...?

23:35.249 --> 23:39.823
Because inside my manly exterior beats the heart of a 14-year-old girl.

23:42.381 --> 23:44.341
Hi. Sandy gave me your address.

23:44.432 --> 23:46.423
I thought you'd want these as soon as possible.

23:46.539 --> 23:47.421
Thanks.

23:47.523 --> 23:49.641
I'm sure Johnny's mom will appreciate it.

23:49.749 --> 23:50.622
Yeah.

23:50.751 --> 23:53.158
So are we going to see you and Ryan tonight at the party?

23:53.265 --> 23:54.371
I don't think so.

23:54.478 --> 23:55.656
We got in a fight.

23:57.548 --> 23:59.448
I got in a fight. It was my fault.

23:59.584 --> 24:03.434
Well, I'm sure that Ryan will accept your heartfelt apology.

24:03.541 --> 24:05.680
I was more going to give him a cooling off period.

24:05.783 --> 24:10.996
Well, hey, if you need anything else, paperwork related, or just to talk, let me know.

24:11.095 --> 24:11.663
Thanks.

24:11.778 --> 24:12.848
Happy Valentine's Day.

24:12.966 --> 24:14.268
You, too.

24:39.927 --> 24:42.164
Hey, it's Ryan. Leave a message.

24:47.039 --> 24:51.559
Well, as I mentioned on the phone, my friend Julie and I have a dating service.

24:51.947 --> 24:54.479
And, uh... - thank you - we're having a party tonight.

24:54.569 --> 24:57.918
And, as I mentioned on the phone, I don't need a service to get a date.

24:58.016 --> 24:59.307
Oh, I know.

24:59.417 --> 25:01.191
It's us who needs you.

25:01.306 --> 25:03.565
It would mean a lot to have someone like you--

25:03.663 --> 25:06.424
who's young, and active in Newport's business and social life--

25:06.519 --> 25:08.341
to be a part of the event.

25:08.831 --> 25:12.881
Of course, if you have plans with someone special...

25:13.167 --> 25:15.524
You mean someone like Matt Ramsey?

25:17.247 --> 25:19.523
I know who your husband is, Kirsten.

25:19.631 --> 25:23.638
And I seriously doubt this last-minute invitation is a total coincidence.

25:24.384 --> 25:25.994
Maya, I'm sorry.

25:27.553 --> 25:30.951
So just how badly does Matt want to go out with me?

25:31.319 --> 25:32.760
You're not upset?

25:32.875 --> 25:36.146
I was, when I first realized why you were calling.

25:36.274 --> 25:38.358
But I've liked Matt since college.

25:38.459 --> 25:40.812
And, as much as I won't admit it to him,

25:40.914 --> 25:43.538
I was disappointed he didn't ask me out after our dinner.

25:43.662 --> 25:45.609
Well, he regrets his decision.

25:47.829 --> 25:49.950
Fine. I'll go.

25:51.950 --> 25:55.365
I see you've picked up a little something for your lady, and I for mine.

25:55.501 --> 25:58.898
Uh... your lady is my mother, and I really don't want to talk about it.

25:59.005 --> 26:01.143
Women's underwear has gotten very complicated.

26:01.252 --> 26:03.650
Thongs, bikinis, briefs...

26:04.043 --> 26:06.464
Who knew women's panties were such a minefield.

26:06.562 --> 26:07.912
Don't say panties.

26:08.023 --> 26:08.981
So?

26:09.990 --> 26:11.385
You and Summer good?

26:11.480 --> 26:12.573
We will be.

26:12.680 --> 26:13.999
What did you do this time?

26:14.131 --> 26:17.785
A certain circumstance was not fully disclosed,

26:17.875 --> 26:20.597
and my omission was discovered.

26:20.703 --> 26:21.698
You got caught in a lie.

26:21.807 --> 26:24.589
In a nutshell, yeah, but I don't see why she's making such a big deal about it.

26:24.707 --> 26:25.975
It's not like it's the first time.

26:26.113 --> 26:29.164
Well, maybe she thinks of you as a man, not a kid.

26:29.258 --> 26:32.864
Kids lie all the time, but a man's only as good as his word.

26:33.368 --> 26:35.346
Well, Summer deserves a good man.

26:35.454 --> 26:36.947
Summer has a good man.

26:37.055 --> 26:38.653
- She does?
- Yeah.

26:38.854 --> 26:40.968
Why didn't you tell me? How long have you known?

26:41.079 --> 26:42.276
Just show her.

26:44.499 --> 26:47.108
I got to pick up a few more things for your mother.

26:47.258 --> 26:50.535
I promised her the best Valentine's Day ever.

26:55.978 --> 26:56.914
Hi.

26:57.025 --> 26:57.917
I'll give you a hand.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.690
No, I got it, thanks.

27:00.943 --> 27:03.189
It's you. What are you doing here? What do you want?

27:03.293 --> 27:05.354
Oh, thought I'd stop by, pay my respects.

27:05.456 --> 27:08.174
I didn't really get a chance to say anything to Mrs. Harper yesterday.

27:08.295 --> 27:11.450
I know she'll want to thank you for trying to help him.

27:11.566 --> 27:12.957
She's inside, if you want to go in.

27:13.061 --> 27:14.259
No. Let me help you.

27:14.372 --> 27:15.676
I got it. It's cool.

27:18.979 --> 27:20.163
Not cool.

27:20.371 --> 27:21.209
Thank you.

27:21.314 --> 27:22.282
You're welcome.

27:23.269 --> 27:25.637
I guess it's kind of an automatic reaction.

27:25.738 --> 27:29.449
You're carrying groceries or moving something, so someone offers to help

27:29.681 --> 27:32.520
and, sure, it's nice to share the heavy lifting

27:32.605 --> 27:35.369
when you're carrying a futon up three flights of stairs.

27:35.486 --> 27:38.489
But is it really worth enduring the awkward conversation?

27:38.767 --> 27:41.455
And they're doing you a favor, so you have to be all nice.

27:41.550 --> 27:43.720
So being nice, that's an effort for you?

27:44.116 --> 27:47.553
Kind of, yeah, when I'm carrying a futon up three flights of stairs.

27:47.663 --> 27:49.076
What are these for?

27:49.176 --> 27:50.797
I'm packing up Johnny's room...

27:51.053 --> 27:52.812
so my aunt won't have to.

27:57.449 --> 27:58.387
All done?

27:58.564 --> 27:59.689
All done.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.316
You know, I might have to rethink my whole position

28:04.417 --> 28:06.943
on not accepting help from strangers.

28:07.933 --> 28:09.792
Okay. Upstairs.

28:09.915 --> 28:11.485
This isn't awkward, right?

28:11.567 --> 28:12.913
This isn't awkward at all.

28:17.888 --> 28:18.951
For you.

28:20.821 --> 28:22.653
Too bad you're already dressed.

28:22.778 --> 28:24.299
I was hoping you'd wear this.

28:25.584 --> 28:28.461
Is it the black one with the beige trim or the beige one with the black trim?

28:28.576 --> 28:29.657
Find out.

28:35.157 --> 28:37.374
This is a fantasy I'm not aware of.

28:37.485 --> 28:38.317
I didn't buy that.

28:39.311 --> 28:39.937
Ow!

28:40.062 --> 28:43.037
I... I didn't buy that. I can explain.

28:43.126 --> 28:45.084
You think the situation can be fixed with lingerie?

28:45.172 --> 28:49.602
No. Not even if it's very sexy, and it says so right here on the tag.

28:49.685 --> 28:52.121
The point is, I made a mistake. I will fix it.

28:52.234 --> 28:55.381
Cohen, our problem cannot be fixed with underwear--

28:55.474 --> 28:57.600
not even age-appropriate underwear with the right cup size.

28:57.697 --> 29:01.036
How can I prove to you that I'm not going to do something I say I'm not going to do.

29:01.131 --> 29:02.553
Well, the pressure was on,

29:02.698 --> 29:07.308
and you needed to come with a revolutionary idea and rock my world!

29:08.694 --> 29:10.374
I think Valentine's Day is off.

29:10.497 --> 29:11.391
Fine.

29:14.277 --> 29:15.887
I got you a card.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.189
Deal with it, Ramon.

29:31.281 --> 29:34.459
Death Cab for Cutie is playing the Smog Shop, and Jake asked me to go.

29:34.568 --> 29:36.566
Playing Death Cab in the Valley?

29:36.669 --> 29:38.470
Never listening to them again.

29:38.709 --> 29:39.552
I know.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.372
You look nice.

29:42.799 --> 29:44.690
Mom forcing you to go out?

29:44.798 --> 29:47.102
Well, I sharpened my bamboo sticks.

29:47.221 --> 29:49.926
Turns out no force was necessary.

29:50.111 --> 29:52.834
I'm just glad to get out of this trailer.

29:52.945 --> 29:56.261
You know, Marissa, honey, it's not too late to change your mind.

29:56.375 --> 29:58.283
Fresh air, all the baked clams you can eat.

29:58.379 --> 30:03.399
Yeah, that sounds tempting, but I think I just need to be alone.

30:05.369 --> 30:06.331
Okay.

30:08.057 --> 30:08.967
Hey.

30:09.520 --> 30:11.216
I wasn't expecting you.

30:12.494 --> 30:14.617
- Um... hi.
- Hi.

30:14.800 --> 30:18.000
I was hoping I could convince you to join me at the party.

30:18.927 --> 30:20.648
Maybe we'll see both of you.

30:20.759 --> 30:21.241
Yeah.

30:21.331 --> 30:22.573
- Good night.
- Good night.

30:26.347 --> 30:27.625
I got you something.

30:34.230 --> 30:35.513
It's beautiful.

30:35.642 --> 30:38.799
Yeah. Well, put it on. Get dressed.

30:40.843 --> 30:44.887
Or not. Or not. Fine, forget it. Just hang here.

30:45.017 --> 30:47.703
Look, I know you're only trying to be nice.

30:47.841 --> 30:50.688
But I... I really need some time.

30:50.739 --> 30:52.390
That's fine, I get that.

30:53.007 --> 30:55.028
But is it more than that? I mean,

30:55.479 --> 30:59.722
when's the last time we actually hung out together alone?

31:00.831 --> 31:02.643
What, you mean without Johnny?

31:07.493 --> 31:09.315
You're glad he's gone, aren't you?

31:11.387 --> 31:13.341
I'm not even going to answer that.

31:54.817 --> 31:56.616
So did Summer give you back the bag?

31:56.881 --> 31:59.773
Uh, the conversation kind of went in a different direction after that.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.286
Hey. No Marissa?

32:02.435 --> 32:03.299
Yeah. No Summer either?

32:03.409 --> 32:05.491
No, she's over there with her date.

32:05.608 --> 32:06.935
Valentine's Day.

32:07.048 --> 32:08.475
There's too much pressure.

32:09.130 --> 32:11.193
There's Matt. I wonder if his date's shown up.

32:11.306 --> 32:12.669
Oh, cool. Another dude.

32:12.781 --> 32:14.203
I gotta go do something.

32:34.956 --> 32:38.315
Are you going to try to act like this is a strange coincidence ?

32:38.897 --> 32:40.895
Not... anymore.

32:42.376 --> 32:43.779
Can I buy you a drink?

32:44.452 --> 32:46.985
I don't know, can you?

32:48.615 --> 32:50.464
Still got that fake ID?

32:59.376 --> 33:01.076
Happy Valentine's Day, sir.

33:01.202 --> 33:04.337
I was wondering if I could maybe borrow your daughter for a moment?

33:04.436 --> 33:06.954
Cohen. I'm right here. What do you want?

33:10.077 --> 33:11.287
I wrote you something.

33:12.516 --> 33:14.756
- A cocktail napkin?
- It's a confession.

33:14.860 --> 33:15.963
Read it.

33:17.090 --> 33:19.277
"To whom it may concern.

33:19.420 --> 33:22.854
My name is Seth Cohen and I have a problem with flying."

33:22.962 --> 33:25.808
It says lying. The pen shook.

33:27.059 --> 33:29.668
"I have lied about many things over the years.

33:29.774 --> 33:34.095
The most recent and troubling lies include, but are not limited to the following:"

33:34.155 --> 33:36.746
There's a complete list on the back of the napkin.

33:36.862 --> 33:39.150
All my sins, very detailed.

33:39.262 --> 33:40.274
Cohen, I know all of this.

33:40.371 --> 33:42.621
I know, but if I ever screw up again,

33:42.751 --> 33:44.598
you give that to my parents.

33:45.652 --> 33:49.047
Hmm, that's pretty smart.

33:49.365 --> 33:52.006
You may have just rocked my world.

33:52.706 --> 33:54.990
I was hoping you'd come up with a half-court shot at the buzzer.

33:55.082 --> 33:57.920
Is that a sports metaphor? I don't follow.

33:58.023 --> 34:01.343
I'm wearing the thong.

34:01.553 --> 34:04.644
Oh, yeah, that's... that's my mom's.

34:04.935 --> 34:05.890
Eww.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.712
What are you doing?

34:18.360 --> 34:19.630
Getting wasted.

34:22.875 --> 34:24.295
You and me, Marissa.

34:26.090 --> 34:29.139
We're the only people who understand what we're going through, you know?

34:29.578 --> 34:31.880
You might be right about that.

34:33.545 --> 34:39.000
You know this emotional connection might be a really good platform for a more physical one.

34:39.572 --> 34:41.815
I'm not going to make out with you, Chili.

34:43.088 --> 34:44.791
It's not Chili anymore.

34:44.902 --> 34:46.583
I'm going back to Dennis.

34:46.722 --> 34:49.344
Johnny never liked that nickname anyways.

35:02.289 --> 35:03.344
Some oysters, madam?

35:03.506 --> 35:05.733
Oh, no, I don't do oysters.

35:05.860 --> 35:09.676
If I'm going to swallow something that disgusting there better be something in it for me.

35:10.313 --> 35:11.496
Hey, Mom.

35:11.607 --> 35:13.114
Oh! Hey, baby, how are you?

35:13.238 --> 35:16.751
Um, I was thinking about leaving.

35:16.859 --> 35:18.681
Oh, well, then I'll see you back at the house.

35:18.775 --> 35:21.943
No, I mean, leaving Newport.

35:22.050 --> 35:24.259
Going back to school. Tonight.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.651
Justin, he offered to give me a ride.

35:27.545 --> 35:28.329
Hello.

35:28.438 --> 35:30.112
Julie Cooper Nichol. Kaitlin's mother.

35:30.222 --> 35:31.314
Very nice to meet you.

35:31.432 --> 35:33.190
You have a lovely daughter.

35:33.316 --> 35:37.882
I'll drive under the speed limit, make sure she buckles her seat belt,

35:37.999 --> 35:40.640
stop for coffee several times...

35:42.838 --> 35:45.552
Thank you, Justin, I appreciate that.

35:47.488 --> 35:49.187
Well, I'll see you at parents' weekend,

35:49.292 --> 35:51.748
and promise me, you are definitely coming back.

35:51.849 --> 35:52.898
I promise.

35:53.022 --> 35:54.925
You'll be seeing a lot more of me.

35:55.166 --> 35:59.652
Kaitlin, I'm so sorry if this trip wasn't everything you hoped for.

35:59.755 --> 36:01.243
I'm a Cooper, Mom.

36:01.358 --> 36:02.910
I'll survive.

36:07.692 --> 36:08.789
Okay, bye.

36:18.314 --> 36:19.197
Hi.

36:20.068 --> 36:20.994
Well, hello there.

36:21.149 --> 36:22.409
You look radiant tonight.

36:22.515 --> 36:23.587
Thank you.

36:23.990 --> 36:25.080
I was hoping that we could talk.

36:25.191 --> 36:27.516
- Neil, you don't have to explain.
- No, I think I do.

36:27.631 --> 36:31.371
All this back and forth, coming together, pulling away again--

36:31.455 --> 36:34.425
I think it's happening for a reason.

36:34.514 --> 36:35.517
We just don't belong together.

36:35.618 --> 36:40.860
We both have very complex lives, which will make this very complicated.

36:40.967 --> 36:44.217
Right, I mean, who's looking to make life any more complicated...

36:46.475 --> 36:47.821
Did you say "will"?

36:48.345 --> 36:51.766
I'm sorry it's taken me this long to ask you this.

36:51.878 --> 36:55.830
But I lost my nerve and I wasn't trusting my instincts.

36:56.027 --> 37:01.441
But Julie, would you be my Valentine?

37:06.596 --> 37:07.891
All alone tonight.

37:09.203 --> 37:11.939
Well, I guess that's to be expected under the circumstances.

37:12.046 --> 37:14.405
Marissa and I have been fighting a lot,

37:14.702 --> 37:17.082
mainly about whether Johnny was just a friend or...

37:17.805 --> 37:19.430
Or if it was more than that.

37:19.658 --> 37:22.378
She says it wasn't. I don't think she's lying to me,

37:22.994 --> 37:25.198
but I think she might be lying to herself.

37:26.423 --> 37:31.018
Now that he's gone, how do we move forward, or if?

37:31.135 --> 37:32.769
Well, the night's not over.

37:32.888 --> 37:35.829
Maybe there's a little pit stop you could make on the way home.

37:37.195 --> 37:38.852
Yeah, actually, there is.

37:39.922 --> 37:40.745
Thanks.

37:45.740 --> 37:46.892
How's Ryan?

37:47.353 --> 37:51.162
Oh, he has a lot on his mind, as usual.

37:51.287 --> 37:55.941
Oh, whoa, whoa, Matt and Maya seem to be getting along.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.561
Do you think they're talking about business?

37:57.692 --> 37:58.822
Yeah!

37:58.951 --> 38:02.460
I think right now he's saying how our design offers

38:02.544 --> 38:07.581
more space for emergency care and outpatient services.

38:07.794 --> 38:11.408
I think she's more concerned about wheelchair access in the lobby.

38:11.515 --> 38:14.140
Aw, she's a good soul.

38:28.529 --> 38:29.272
You leaving?

38:29.385 --> 38:32.755
Yeah, don't cry or anything.

38:33.304 --> 38:36.866
Look, I know this wasn't the best vacation you've ever had,

38:36.986 --> 38:41.215
but I really am sorry for everything.

38:41.425 --> 38:42.698
Don't be.

38:43.102 --> 38:45.029
Just figure it all out.

38:45.214 --> 38:46.398
Figure what out?

38:46.499 --> 38:48.344
What you really felt for Johnny.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.756
What does it matter now?

38:55.770 --> 38:59.515
You keep telling yourself whatever you want, but it does matter.

39:06.093 --> 39:08.425
I'm really glad you came back.

39:09.046 --> 39:14.403
I kind of, sort of, maybe, might believe you.

39:21.412 --> 39:22.164
Hi.

39:22.282 --> 39:22.885
Hi.

39:22.992 --> 39:25.220
I was wondering if I could give you a hand?

39:25.334 --> 39:27.423
No, no, I got it. Thank you.

39:29.286 --> 39:31.405
- Okay, I'll just... 
- I mean, really?

39:31.694 --> 39:34.624
Yeah, yeah, I figured you could use the help.

39:37.001 --> 39:39.211
If you want, I could make the conversation a little more awkward.

39:39.317 --> 39:40.794
Well, in that case, please.

39:50.193 --> 39:53.286
Hey, Kait, I think there's something in your eye.

39:53.409 --> 39:56.060
What... It couldn't be... Is that a tear?

39:56.162 --> 39:57.404
Shut up.

40:01.872 --> 40:04.212
You know, as weird as it may sound,

40:05.158 --> 40:07.751
I think I'm actually gonna miss this place.

41:19.205 --> 41:20.442
What are you thinking?

41:20.716 --> 41:24.889
If I could have done or said anything that....

41:27.158 --> 41:28.553
would have saved him.

41:30.965 --> 41:35.170
Well, um, I think it's a hard thing to accept.

41:35.369 --> 41:37.736
That life is completely out of our control.

41:39.399 --> 41:42.151
But you were there for him at the end of the day.

41:42.262 --> 41:44.311
That's all we can really do for each other, you know?

41:44.431 --> 41:45.764
Just be there.

41:48.085 --> 41:50.553
And I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.

42:11.835 --> 42:12.573
Go away.

42:12.707 --> 42:13.701
Look, I just want to talk.

42:13.820 --> 42:15.157
There's nothing to say.

42:15.375 --> 42:17.215
You wouldn't have come here if you didn't want to see me.

42:17.314 --> 42:18.368
It's got nothing to do with you.

42:18.479 --> 42:20.951
Now I think you should leave before I start screaming for the cops.

42:21.058 --> 42:22.971
We both know you're not going to do that.

42:24.846 --> 42:26.174
What the hell is he doing here?

42:28.340 --> 42:29.452
Everything okay?

42:33.615 --> 42:34.826
It is now.

42:36.612 --> 42:37.755
You want tea?

42:54.261 --> 42:57.909
