01:05.860 --> 01:08.130
Sorry to keep you waiting, Detective Beckett.

01:08.130 --> 01:10.620
Not a problem, sir. You're a busy man.

01:10.620 --> 01:12.430
Tell that to the Attorney General.

01:12.430 --> 01:13.740
He just had his first grandchild.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.480
Now he wants to show me pictures.

01:16.770 --> 01:19.790
So Agent Stack spoke very highly of you.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.830
Smart, tenacious,

01:22.830 --> 01:24.620
innovative thinker.

01:24.630 --> 01:27.470
Said you were a good candidate for the opening

01:27.470 --> 01:29.430
on the A.G. Investigative team.

01:29.430 --> 01:31.310
Well, I appreciate his confidence, sir.

01:31.310 --> 01:32.980
You don't agree?

01:33.180 --> 01:36.400
No, sir. It's just that, um...

01:36.700 --> 01:38.610
Well, I'm-- I'm a homicide detective.

01:38.610 --> 01:40.940
I-I don't have any federal experience.

01:40.940 --> 01:42.870
The Attorney General's not looking for federal experience.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.480
He wants people who can get the job done.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.630
And from everything I've read,

01:46.720 --> 01:47.700
that might be you.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.290
Well, that's very kind of you, sir.

01:49.290 --> 01:50.770
It's not kind.

01:50.780 --> 01:52.940
It's what you believe to be true,

01:52.940 --> 01:54.260
isn't it?

01:54.430 --> 01:56.660
It's why you got on the plane this morning,

01:56.660 --> 01:58.570
because given your background,

01:58.570 --> 02:01.410
your qualifications, and your track record,

02:01.830 --> 02:04.090
you know that you're headed for bigger things.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.090
Just like you know that opportunities like this

02:06.090 --> 02:09.570
come along once, maybe twice in a lifetime.

02:10.229 --> 02:13.270
But if that's not what you believe,

02:13.630 --> 02:18.040
if you think that you're just a homicide cop...

02:20.470 --> 02:22.120
door's right over there.

02:24.190 --> 02:27.690
No, sir. I know why I'm here.

02:29.470 --> 02:31.040
Well, take a seat.

02:31.290 --> 02:32.890
Let's get started.

02:34.170 --> 02:35.250
Dad, we need to talk.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.070
Which of these do you like better?

02:37.190 --> 02:38.430
Dad, I'm serious.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.300
I like the green one, but it kind of looks like

02:40.300 --> 02:42.300
a giant green lizard is attacking the city,

02:42.310 --> 02:44.010
which is cool, but it's not what the book is about.

02:44.010 --> 02:47.120
So I either rewrite the book to make it about a giant lizard

02:47.120 --> 02:47.910
- Or-- - Dad.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.050
Magenta. You're right.

02:49.050 --> 02:51.410
It's classic, it's cool, it tells the story--

02:51.420 --> 02:52.690
Dad.

02:53.010 --> 02:55.090
- What? - Professor Rankowsky still hasn't received

02:55.090 --> 02:57.280
the check for my Costa Rica trip.

02:57.590 --> 02:59.050
He didn't? That's so weird.

02:59.050 --> 03:00.440
You didn't send it, did you?

03:00.440 --> 03:03.140
I'd--why--just why do you want to go study the rain forest

03:03.140 --> 03:04.290
for six weeks anyway?

03:04.290 --> 03:05.610
Dad, we talked about this.

03:05.610 --> 03:07.620
I know, but you're gonna be staying

03:07.620 --> 03:09.250
in the middle of a jungle,

03:09.250 --> 03:11.110
miles away from the nearest phone,

03:11.110 --> 03:13.440
hours from the nearest hospital.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.220
You could be bitten by a poisonous spider

03:15.220 --> 03:16.730
or a poisonous snake.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.610
I looked it up.

03:17.610 --> 03:20.940
Toucans are extremely aggressive this time of year.

03:20.940 --> 03:22.920
Is this about Paris?

03:25.650 --> 03:27.360
I will admit to being...

03:28.390 --> 03:32.150
slightly overprotective in light of recent events.

03:32.700 --> 03:35.810
Dad, I can't stop living my life because of what happened.

03:35.810 --> 03:36.980
And, yeah, I still have nightmares,

03:36.980 --> 03:39.430
but that's one of the reasons I want to go.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.920
I don't want to let fear win.

03:41.990 --> 03:43.270
No.

03:43.850 --> 03:46.050
No, of course. You're right. I'll...

03:47.010 --> 03:48.690
I'll write the check.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.800
But it's not gonna stop me from worrying about you

03:52.270 --> 03:53.810
or missing you.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.260
And I wouldn't want you to.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.830
But it's only six weeks.

04:00.830 --> 04:03.140
It's not like I'm going away forever.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.490
No, but it sounds like someone has.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.210
Good to see ya.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.750
Hey, 'sito.

04:16.750 --> 04:17.930
Where's Beckett?

04:17.930 --> 04:18.860
How the hell should I know?

04:18.860 --> 04:20.600
Aren't you two practically living together now?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.440
Ah, well, she left me alone for a couple of days

04:22.440 --> 04:24.510
so I could finish "Deadly Heat", which, by the way,

04:24.520 --> 04:27.110
is both deadly and hot, thank you very much for asking.

04:27.110 --> 04:28.660
I didn't.

04:28.660 --> 04:29.670
Right.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.910
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

04:31.910 --> 04:32.780
Everything okay?

04:32.780 --> 04:34.910
Um... yeah, fine.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.170
So, um, what do we got?

04:37.470 --> 04:38.750
This way.

04:40.950 --> 04:42.670
The Cedric's pretty typical.

04:42.670 --> 04:44.560
No-star residential hotel.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.700
Mostly transients and foreign tourists

04:46.710 --> 04:48.440
that don't know any better.

04:48.440 --> 04:52.180
Guests started complaining of a strange colored water

04:52.180 --> 04:55.330
and also a foul odor coming from the pipes this morning.

04:55.330 --> 04:57.350
When maintenance finally checked it out,

04:57.360 --> 04:59.050
they found her.

04:59.050 --> 04:59.650
Hey, Lanie.

04:59.650 --> 05:02.180
Hey. So we've got a caucasian female.

05:02.180 --> 05:05.050
Probably 20, 21 years old.

05:05.150 --> 05:05.810
How'd she die?

05:05.810 --> 05:06.810
Not sure yet.

05:06.810 --> 05:08.920
There's evidence of blunt-force trauma to the head.

05:08.930 --> 05:11.630
But I won't know cause until I get her back to the morgue.

05:11.630 --> 05:13.430
C.S.U. found traces of blood and hair

05:13.430 --> 05:14.930
on that ventilation fan.

05:14.930 --> 05:16.480
They're running it for a match.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.690
So someone smashed her on the head

05:17.690 --> 05:18.670
and then dumped her in the tank?

05:18.670 --> 05:19.440
Uh, looks like it.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.130
They found blood at the base of that ladder

05:21.130 --> 05:22.520
and on the handrailing.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.640
Also a bloody partial print.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.770
Who else had access to the roof?

05:26.770 --> 05:27.740
Pretty much anyone.

05:27.740 --> 05:30.130
The latch on the door has been busted for years,

05:30.130 --> 05:32.290
and often, the residents will sneak up here for a smoke.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.610
And what do we know about her?

05:33.610 --> 05:35.580
Building manager identified her as a resident

05:35.580 --> 05:36.930
named Crystal Sky.

05:36.930 --> 05:39.640
checked in 10 days ago to a room on the 18th floor.

05:39.650 --> 05:40.470
Paid with cash.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.430
Crystal Sky? That name's so fake,

05:42.430 --> 05:43.860
It sounds like something out of one of your books.

05:43.860 --> 05:44.870
Right?

05:44.870 --> 05:47.180
Whoa. What--what--what is that supposed to mean?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.000
What do you mean, what is that supposed to mean?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.660
Derrick Storm? Nikki Heat?

05:50.660 --> 05:52.060
Jameson Rook?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.020
Would it kill you to name someone Gonzales

05:54.020 --> 05:54.920
every once in a while?

05:54.920 --> 05:56.820
Well, with no I.D. found on the body,

05:56.820 --> 05:59.100
No purse, wallet, or phone in the room,

05:59.100 --> 06:00.550
it's hard to know who she is.

06:00.550 --> 06:02.020
Well, she's been here for ten days.

06:02.020 --> 06:03.980
She must have made some friends.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.330
Yeah, I knew her. Um...

06:05.330 --> 06:07.730
I mean, we talked sometimes in the laundry room.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.210
Did she tell you anything about herself,

06:09.210 --> 06:10.600
like where she was from?

06:10.600 --> 06:12.880
Texas. Lubbock, I think.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.760
But, you know, things were bad at home. Her dad.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.740
Any idea what she was doing in the city?

06:17.740 --> 06:19.430
Oh, I can tell you what she was doing.

06:19.430 --> 06:20.390
The girl was a prostitute.

06:20.390 --> 06:22.720
She wasn't a prostitute. Why you gotta say that?

06:22.720 --> 06:24.170
Because it's true.

06:24.170 --> 06:25.400
The way she dressed,

06:25.400 --> 06:27.650
the sounds coming out of her room at all hours of the night--

06:27.650 --> 06:28.650
We all knew it.

06:28.650 --> 06:29.780
What kind of sounds?

06:29.780 --> 06:32.920
Her with her Johns. The walls here are pretty thin.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.760
Hey, you don't know what you're talking about, okay?

06:34.760 --> 06:37.140
Oh, Ziff, I know you liked her.

06:37.140 --> 06:38.810
But somebody killed that poor girl.

06:38.810 --> 06:40.680
These folks need to know the truth.

06:40.690 --> 06:42.500
When was the last time any of you saw her?

06:42.500 --> 06:43.760
I saw her yesterday.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.910
11:00 p.m. She was heading for the laundry room.

06:45.910 --> 06:47.200
Was anybody with her?

06:47.200 --> 06:48.610
No, she was alone.

06:48.610 --> 06:50.020
Okay, thank you.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.770
C.S.U. Just finished their sweep.

06:52.770 --> 06:53.810
Did they find anything?

06:53.810 --> 06:55.730
It's what they didn't find. There were no prints.

06:55.730 --> 06:57.090
It's like the place has been wiped down.

06:57.090 --> 06:58.350
The killer must have come back to the room

06:58.360 --> 06:59.570
to get rid of the evidence.

06:59.580 --> 07:00.470
All right, set up a canvass.

07:00.470 --> 07:02.670
See if anyone else entered or exited that room.

07:02.670 --> 07:05.370
And, uh, let's pull surveillance footage

07:05.370 --> 07:06.910
from the security cam in the elevator.

07:06.910 --> 07:09.670
- Maybe it'll tell us who she was with. - Right on.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.870
It doesn't take a best-selling mystery writer

07:11.870 --> 07:13.140
to figure this one out.

07:13.140 --> 07:15.170
Small-town girl with big-city dreams

07:15.170 --> 07:17.490
ends up turning tricks to survive.

07:17.490 --> 07:20.030
It's a tragic, yet all-too-familiar tale.

07:20.030 --> 07:21.100
Except...

07:21.100 --> 07:22.450
That's not this girl's story.

07:22.450 --> 07:24.900
We just got a fingerprint match off the victim's body.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.400
Uh, her name's not Crystal Sky.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.190
She's definitely not from Lubbock, Texas.

07:29.190 --> 07:30.270
Well, who is she?

07:30.270 --> 07:31.140
Erika Albrook.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.750
She's an honors student at Harvard.

07:35.370 --> 07:38.500
Our skid-row hooker is a Harvard honors student?

07:39.270 --> 07:43.030
Like I said, a tragic, yet not-so-familiar tale.

07:54.260 --> 07:55.610
This makes no sense.

07:55.610 --> 07:57.100
She was supposed to be in Europe

07:57.100 --> 07:58.390
backpacking with her friends.

07:58.390 --> 08:02.180
I mean... we dropped her off at the airport.

08:02.180 --> 08:03.860
- When? - Last Monday.

08:03.860 --> 08:06.090
The same day she checked in to that hotel.

08:06.090 --> 08:08.340
Any idea what she'd be doing in the city?

08:08.340 --> 08:10.590
None. And why would she stay there?

08:10.590 --> 08:13.120
My sister has a place in midtown.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.240
Were there any personal issues that we should know about?

08:16.240 --> 08:20.460
Did she have any problems with... drugs or money?

08:20.610 --> 08:22.010
Erika would never use drugs,

08:22.010 --> 08:24.740
and she had... she had plenty of money

08:24.740 --> 08:26.940
in her bank account for Europe.

08:27.110 --> 08:29.360
Is it possible she met someone in the city,

08:29.370 --> 08:30.160
a new boyfriend?

08:30.160 --> 08:31.670
She would've told us.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.580
Are you sure about that?

08:34.140 --> 08:35.850
I don't know anymore.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.650
The only thing I do know is, our daughter

08:37.650 --> 08:40.900
would never stay in a place like that.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.880
Detective, this isn't her.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.520
Straight-A student, no history of trouble,

08:48.520 --> 08:50.420
on a dream European vacation

08:50.420 --> 08:54.120
turns into a hooker in a ratty hotel.

08:54.360 --> 08:57.020
There is no way I'm letting Alexis go to Costa Rica now.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.740
Maybe she broke under the pressure of being perfect

08:59.740 --> 09:01.550
or maybe she just decided

09:01.560 --> 09:02.990
she needed a change.

09:02.990 --> 09:05.190
Honors student to prostitute in less than a week?

09:05.190 --> 09:06.930
That's quite a change.

09:06.930 --> 09:08.250
Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.870
Mm. Hey, where were you this morning?

09:10.870 --> 09:11.510
What do you mean?

09:11.510 --> 09:13.520
Just called you, a bunch of times.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.720
Uh, my phone must have been off.

09:16.370 --> 09:17.560
Hey, guys.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.000
Come check this out.

09:23.820 --> 09:25.940
11:00 p.m. The night Erika died.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.410
She takes the elevator down to the laundry room.

09:28.740 --> 09:30.200
Now this is 11:05.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.840
She takes the elevator back up to her room.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.350
Seems perfectly normal.

09:33.350 --> 09:35.050
Yeah, but watch.

09:35.060 --> 09:37.010
This is just after midnight.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.140
She takes the elevator up to the top floor,

09:39.140 --> 09:42.100
Alone, but watch what happens when she gets there.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.520
It looks like she's making sure no one sees her.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.460
Or following her. But that's it.

09:48.950 --> 09:50.670
She doesn't come back down.

09:50.670 --> 09:53.270
And no one goes back up there until 4:00 a.m.

09:53.270 --> 09:54.340
What about earlier?

09:54.340 --> 09:56.440
No. The last person to go up to the top floor

09:56.440 --> 09:58.470
was another hotel guest an hour earlier,

09:58.470 --> 09:59.410
but the guy's 80 years old.

09:59.410 --> 10:01.310
There's no way he's climbing a water tower with a body.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.510
Sounds like whoever killed her used the stairs.

10:03.510 --> 10:06.800
Hey. So... No recent activity on her phone.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.180
She left it with her parents

10:08.180 --> 10:10.050
since she was supposed to be in Europe.

10:10.050 --> 10:12.510
But, um, check this out.

10:12.550 --> 10:13.510
Credit card charge?

10:13.510 --> 10:14.940
Yeah, from two days ago.

10:14.940 --> 10:17.550
It's her only transaction since checking in to the hotel.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.670
Margo's.

10:18.670 --> 10:20.650
That's a restaurant in midtown. It's expensive.

10:20.650 --> 10:21.770
Yeah, and she wasn't alone.

10:21.770 --> 10:24.330
Turns out she split the check with a Talia McTeague.

10:24.330 --> 10:26.810
Okay, run her down. Maybe she can give us some answers.

10:26.810 --> 10:28.400
Uh, is there anything on the canvass?

10:28.400 --> 10:29.560
Nothing useful.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.930
None of the occupants of the hotel

10:30.930 --> 10:33.480
admit to seeing anyone going in and out of her hotel room.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.150
But given what they heard coming from her room at night,

10:36.150 --> 10:37.920
it's pretty clear she was a prostitute.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.160
If she was a prostitute, she wasn't very good at it.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.110
Seriously?

10:42.110 --> 10:43.230
You can tell that?

10:43.230 --> 10:45.690
Prostitution usually means sex,

10:45.690 --> 10:47.830
and there's no evidence of sexual activity.

10:47.830 --> 10:48.990
But what I did find

10:48.990 --> 10:51.460
were defensive wounds, bruising around the neck,

10:51.470 --> 10:53.890
and evidence of multiple blows to the head.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.210
I'm guessing someone held her by her throat

10:56.210 --> 10:59.310
and slammed her head into that ventilation fan.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.170
Lack of water in the lungs indicate

11:01.170 --> 11:02.890
that she was dead before she went in the tank.

11:02.890 --> 11:04.650
Then why bother even putting her in there?

11:04.650 --> 11:07.230
Water has a great way of washing away things

11:07.230 --> 11:08.880
like trace D.N.A.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.010
Wait a minute. I don't understand.

11:10.010 --> 11:11.200
If she wasn't having sex,

11:11.210 --> 11:14.440
then what were all of those sounds coming out of her room?

11:21.760 --> 11:23.700
Okay. So she wasn't really a hooker,

11:23.700 --> 11:25.930
she just wanted everyone to think that she was.

11:25.930 --> 11:26.640
Why?

11:26.640 --> 11:29.120
I don't know, but not everyone thought she was a hooker.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.490
That guy next door, he was pretty adamant she wasn't.

11:32.890 --> 11:35.390
So what did he know that the others didn't?

11:37.580 --> 11:39.470
I've already told you what I know.

11:39.470 --> 11:41.590
Not everything, Ziff.

11:42.190 --> 11:43.750
How did you know she wasn't a prostitute?

11:43.750 --> 11:45.370
Please, look, I don't want any trouble.

11:45.370 --> 11:46.980
- Did you murder her? - What? No.

11:46.980 --> 11:49.670
Then nothing you say is gonna get you into trouble.

11:51.350 --> 11:54.720
Well, I heard those... sounds, you know.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.590
Come on, Ziff.

11:56.740 --> 11:58.170
There's a hole...

11:59.410 --> 12:02.550
in the wall in the back of the closet.

12:03.260 --> 12:04.320
You were spying on her?

12:04.320 --> 12:05.760
What did you see?

12:05.760 --> 12:07.390
Well, that's the thing. I heard all those sounds,

12:07.390 --> 12:09.250
but there was nothing going on.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.870
It was just her sitting on the bed all night,

12:10.870 --> 12:12.430
fully dressed, with her headphones on,

12:12.430 --> 12:13.910
typing on her laptop.

12:13.910 --> 12:15.630
There wasn't a laptop in the room.

12:15.630 --> 12:17.340
There used to be. She'd be on it all night,

12:17.350 --> 12:19.140
staring at the screen.

12:19.420 --> 12:21.830
Did you ever see anyone else in there with her?

12:21.830 --> 12:23.100
No.

12:23.370 --> 12:25.100
It was always just her.

12:27.970 --> 12:29.410
Thanks for coming in, Ms. McTeague.

12:29.410 --> 12:32.210
Of course. I can't believe she's dead.

12:32.470 --> 12:34.920
So, um, how did you know Erika?

12:34.960 --> 12:36.910
We were friends from Harvard.

12:36.910 --> 12:39.210
We were both computer science majors.

12:39.220 --> 12:40.750
Do you know what she was doing in the city?

12:40.750 --> 12:41.520
No.

12:41.520 --> 12:44.560
But you had lunch with her two days ago. Why?

12:44.560 --> 12:46.590
It was... weird.

12:46.590 --> 12:50.360
That morning, I was getting coffee from this place in the village,

12:50.360 --> 12:53.580
and I saw her in this big argument with some guy.

12:53.580 --> 12:55.560
She was dressed very different--

12:55.560 --> 12:58.250
sexed up and her hair was pink.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.440
Anyway, he storms off,

13:00.440 --> 13:02.750
and I go up to her to say hello.

13:02.750 --> 13:06.380
And she just looks at me with this panicked look on her face

13:07.290 --> 13:08.790
and--and bolts.

13:08.790 --> 13:10.690
Later that day, she tracked me down,

13:10.690 --> 13:12.320
called me at my office, and said

13:12.320 --> 13:14.010
we needed to meet up right away.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.410
So what happened at lunch?

13:15.410 --> 13:17.890
She begged me not to tell anyone that she was in the city,

13:17.890 --> 13:19.190
that if people found out,

13:19.190 --> 13:20.610
she could be in a lot of trouble.

13:20.610 --> 13:22.070
Did she say why?

13:22.070 --> 13:24.270
I kept asking her what was going on,

13:24.270 --> 13:26.410
but she wouldn't talk about it.

13:26.420 --> 13:29.620
She said she was on some sort of a mission.

13:29.620 --> 13:30.990
A mission?

13:30.990 --> 13:32.730
This guy that she was arguing with,

13:32.730 --> 13:35.230
do you know who he was or what they were arguing about?

13:35.230 --> 13:36.600
No.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.490
I just heard him say,

13:38.640 --> 13:41.230
"You have no idea what you're up against."

13:41.230 --> 13:43.710
"These people don't mess around."

13:45.200 --> 13:46.740
Can you describe him?

13:47.130 --> 13:48.410
Yeah.

13:49.060 --> 13:50.430
Uniforms are canvassing the Cedric,

13:50.430 --> 13:51.890
but so far, nobody recognizes him.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.660
Here's what I don't get-- why go through all the trouble

13:53.660 --> 13:55.030
of creating a fake persona

13:55.030 --> 13:56.950
when you're just gonna be on your laptop all night?

13:56.950 --> 13:58.320
Wait.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.650
Does the Cedric have wi-fi?

13:59.650 --> 14:01.180
Yeah, that's about all it has.

14:01.180 --> 14:02.880
Computer science major,

14:02.880 --> 14:04.650
hours on her laptop?

14:04.660 --> 14:05.630
She's a hacker,

14:05.630 --> 14:07.120
which is why she was staying at the Cedric.

14:07.130 --> 14:08.750
She could pay in cash and remain anonymous

14:08.750 --> 14:10.190
while she was using the I.P. Address.

14:10.190 --> 14:11.680
Exactly, and whatever she was hacking into

14:11.680 --> 14:13.290
was either so illegal or so dangerous,

14:13.290 --> 14:14.900
she had to make sure they couldn't trace it back to her.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.460
And even if they did trace it back to her,

14:16.460 --> 14:19.020
they'd still have to find her amongst hundreds of residents.

14:19.020 --> 14:20.840
So she created a whole false persona.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.740
And who's gonna look twice at a runaway hooker?

14:22.740 --> 14:24.580
I mean, she's like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

14:24.590 --> 14:25.820
Only they did find her,

14:25.820 --> 14:27.660
which is why we can't find her laptop.

14:27.670 --> 14:28.920
Whoever she went up against

14:28.920 --> 14:30.150
killed her and took it.

14:30.150 --> 14:32.560
Uh, problem. We don't know who she went up against,

14:32.560 --> 14:33.660
and none of her friends seem to know either.

14:33.660 --> 14:36.120
Okay, contact the Cedric's internet provider

14:36.120 --> 14:37.730
and get a list of all the I.P. addresses

14:37.730 --> 14:40.000
accessed by residents over the past two weeks.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.510
There's gotta be an answer somewhere in there.

14:43.310 --> 14:45.730
How about I take a break from writing tonight,

14:45.730 --> 14:47.770
you come to my place, I open a bottle of wine?

14:47.770 --> 14:49.250
Detective Beckett.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.680
Can I have a word?

14:50.680 --> 14:52.070
Yes.

14:53.730 --> 14:54.430
I'll catch you later?

14:54.430 --> 14:55.980
She's all yours.

14:57.200 --> 14:57.770
Sir.

14:57.770 --> 14:59.240
Shut the door.

15:05.340 --> 15:06.560
Have a seat.

15:08.510 --> 15:10.340
I,uh...

15:11.850 --> 15:14.180
just got a call about you...

15:14.610 --> 15:19.560
from the deputy director of the FBI.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.170
Apparently you had quite the interview in D. C.

15:23.530 --> 15:24.740
this morning.

15:25.630 --> 15:26.310
Look,sir,it was--

15:26.310 --> 15:28.380
I just want to tell you that,um...

15:32.810 --> 15:35.180
I gave you my highest recommendation.

15:35.180 --> 15:36.390
You did?

15:36.390 --> 15:40.180
Kate,this is the kind of work you were meant to be doing.

15:40.610 --> 15:44.330
You'd be on the national stage, utilizing all your talents.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.270
This is an incredible opportunity.

15:46.270 --> 15:48.210
I would've killed to have a shot at something like this

15:48.210 --> 15:49.390
when I was your age.

15:49.390 --> 15:51.410
Thank you,sir,but it was just an interview.

15:51.410 --> 15:54.230
I mean,it's a long shot at best.

15:54.230 --> 15:56.530
No,I wouldn't be so sure about that.

15:56.530 --> 15:59.910
From what I hear, you're on a short list.

15:59.910 --> 16:03.580
And with any luck, this could be your last case.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.990
Oh,girl,you scared me.

16:20.190 --> 16:22.000
What are you doing here so early?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.700
I just wanted to see if you had anything new on the victim.

16:25.030 --> 16:27.670
Well,I was able to place time of death

16:27.670 --> 16:30.210
between 12:00 midnight and 1:00 a. m.

16:30.850 --> 16:33.800
Oh,and I found traces of creosote under her fingernails,

16:33.800 --> 16:35.350
which is probably meaningless

16:35.350 --> 16:39.280
since the boiler room is right next to the laundry room...

16:39.480 --> 16:42.070
And it could've gotten on her hands when she went down there.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.410
But...

16:45.560 --> 16:47.950
that's not why you're here,is it?

16:49.310 --> 16:52.300
Okay. What's wrong?

16:52.300 --> 16:54.110
Nothing...

16:54.770 --> 16:56.480
yet.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.570
Lanie,if you had the opportunity

16:58.570 --> 17:01.120
to do something that you wanted to do

17:01.120 --> 17:03.800
but it would mean that...

17:04.550 --> 17:07.430
everything in your life might change,

17:08.010 --> 17:09.260
would you take it?

17:09.260 --> 17:11.640
Well,it depends.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.280
How good is the opportunity?

17:13.280 --> 17:16.800
Great. Really,really great.

17:18.740 --> 17:20.450
But the job's in D. C.

17:21.260 --> 17:23.440
And you're worried about Castle.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.869
I mean,we're in this relationship,but...

17:27.940 --> 17:30.160
we never talk about where we're going.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.140
And that's okay right now. It's just...

17:35.210 --> 17:37.030
But if I get that job...

17:37.030 --> 17:38.890
Then you're gonna have to.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.670
Yeah.

17:41.130 --> 17:43.780
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

17:43.780 --> 17:45.730
Yeah,but what if it is?

17:51.150 --> 17:53.810
Hey,Castle.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.110
Yeah. No,I just wanted to get an early start on the day.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.270
I didn't want to wake you up.

18:00.860 --> 18:03.010
Okay. All right. I'll meet you there.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.630
So I ran down all the I. P. addresses

18:13.630 --> 18:15.720
that were accessed through the hotel server...

18:15.720 --> 18:17.510
to find out what our victim was up to.

18:17.510 --> 18:18.620
Any luck?

18:18.620 --> 18:20.660
The majority of the I. P. s were to porn sites.

18:20.660 --> 18:21.460
Really,which ones?

18:21.460 --> 18:23.040
I took the liberty of ruling those out,

18:23.040 --> 18:24.800
as well as normal commercial sites--

18:24.800 --> 18:26.720
Google,Amazon,YouTube.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.560
That narrowed it down to a couple hundred sites.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.090
So we're still looking for a needle in a haystack.

18:31.090 --> 18:33.280
Not necessarily. I took those and went back,

18:33.280 --> 18:36.540
looking for multiple unique site hits that coincided with the dates

18:36.540 --> 18:38.680
your victim was checked in to the hotel.

18:38.790 --> 18:40.250
That left about 20.

18:40.450 --> 18:41.410
Now we're talking,girl.

18:41.410 --> 18:43.250
- I-I can deal with 20. - You might not have to.

18:43.250 --> 18:46.300
Of those 20, I looked for I. P. s that were accessed late at night...

18:46.300 --> 18:48.090
during the period when your witness claimed...

18:48.090 --> 18:50.030
the victim was on her laptop.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.080
This is your most likely candidate.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.520
The server I. P. was accessed multiple times a night

18:55.520 --> 18:58.220
nearly every night Erika was at the hotel.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.530
And who's it belong to?

18:59.530 --> 19:02.120
I. P. was traced to Banks and Bauer.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.300
It's a boutique law firm in midtown.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.980
Represents high-level politicos and corporations.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.490
Maybe Erika was some kind of

19:08.490 --> 19:10.020
online Erin Brockovich,

19:10.020 --> 19:11.230
You know,a crusader for good

19:11.230 --> 19:13.620
delving into the seedy underbelly of the legal system

19:13.620 --> 19:15.970
in order to uncover some seamy truth.

19:15.970 --> 19:18.540
Or maybe she was just hired by a rival firm

19:18.540 --> 19:20.500
to steal privileged information.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.140
Now why must you be so cynical?

19:22.140 --> 19:23.350
It's in my job description.

19:23.350 --> 19:25.160
Which is why you need me.

19:25.650 --> 19:27.090
Okay,why don't you dig into Erika's life?

19:27.090 --> 19:30.060
Castle and I will hit the law firm and see if there's any connection.

19:34.690 --> 19:35.740
Thank you?

19:37.300 --> 19:39.260
No,I've never seen her before in my life.

19:39.260 --> 19:40.860
Ms. Banks,you're sure?

19:40.860 --> 19:42.130
Oh, I'm positive.

19:42.130 --> 19:44.980
Mitch. This is my partner-- Mitch Bauer.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.430
Do you know this girl?

19:47.730 --> 19:49.030
No. Should I?

19:49.030 --> 19:51.180
The police think she may have hacked our server.

19:51.180 --> 19:52.320
Why, what did she access?

19:52.320 --> 19:53.170
We don't know.

19:53.170 --> 19:54.930
- Well, is she in custody? - Sort of.

19:54.930 --> 19:56.190
What do you mean, sort of?

19:56.190 --> 19:56.870
She's dead.

19:56.870 --> 19:58.460
Actually, she was murdered,

19:58.460 --> 20:00.600
and we believe it might have to do with

20:00.600 --> 20:02.400
whatever it was she was trying to access from your system.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.090
Security software and firewall protection

20:04.090 --> 20:05.780
don't indicate any incursion.

20:05.780 --> 20:07.200
Yeah, but if the hacker is good,

20:07.200 --> 20:08.630
your software may not pick it up.

20:08.630 --> 20:10.270
Is there any way to trace network activity

20:10.270 --> 20:12.130
on your server for the past week?

20:12.530 --> 20:13.630
Yeah.

20:15.720 --> 20:19.190
There-- between 11:00 p. m. and 3:00 a. m.

20:19.590 --> 20:21.130
All last week.

20:21.860 --> 20:23.150
But according to the usage logs,

20:23.150 --> 20:25.160
no one was signed on to the system at that time.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.560
Are you telling me, this girl had access

20:26.560 --> 20:28.370
to our records for the past week and a half,

20:28.370 --> 20:30.450
and you have no idea what she was doing?

20:30.720 --> 20:31.550
I'm afraid so.

20:31.550 --> 20:33.490
Are there any cases or litigation

20:33.490 --> 20:35.520
that your firm's involved in currently

20:35.520 --> 20:38.320
that might hinge on privileged information?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.640
Are you kidding me, detective?

20:39.640 --> 20:41.100
We're a law firm.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.330
All of them.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.890
So no one at the law firm

20:43.890 --> 20:44.900
knew what she was looking for either?

20:44.900 --> 20:47.240
Either that or they're covering something up.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.350
But the only evidence of what she was up to

20:49.350 --> 20:51.470
is on that missing laptop.

20:51.470 --> 20:53.260
So without it, we're dead in the water,

20:53.260 --> 20:54.620
Much like Erika.

20:54.790 --> 20:56.060
Too soon.

20:57.470 --> 20:59.590
Hey, guys. I got something.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.700
That phone call that she made to her friend to arrange lunch

21:01.700 --> 21:04.420
had me wondering exactly where that call came from.

21:04.420 --> 21:06.780
Turns out, it was a payphone at the hotel.

21:06.780 --> 21:08.900
So I ran down the other calls made from that phone.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.200
One of 'em popped.

21:10.780 --> 21:11.860
Ian Blaylock?

21:11.860 --> 21:13.720
Yeah, he was an attorney at Banks and Bauer

21:13.720 --> 21:15.860
until he was fired six months ago.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.150
She made three phone calls to him from that phone.

21:18.150 --> 21:20.160
Each lasting over five minutes.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.590
This is Blaylock.

21:25.620 --> 21:28.000
Mr. Blaylock, NYPD.

21:29.260 --> 21:32.010
Mr. Blaylock, open up.

21:51.140 --> 21:53.300
I think our plot just thickened.

22:01.830 --> 22:03.900
I'm pretty sure this wasn't a suicide.

22:03.900 --> 22:04.920
How can you tell?

22:04.920 --> 22:07.840
See that diagonal ligature mark running up his neck?

22:07.840 --> 22:08.430
Yeah.

22:08.430 --> 22:10.030
Well, that's what we'd expect to find

22:10.030 --> 22:11.970
because the weight of the body

22:11.970 --> 22:13.920
pulls the cord into a vertical line.

22:13.920 --> 22:14.710
But?

22:14.710 --> 22:17.630
But this other faint ligature mark--

22:17.630 --> 22:20.130
See how it runs horizontally across his neck?

22:20.130 --> 22:21.870
He was strangled first.

22:22.650 --> 22:23.830
Then strung up.

22:23.830 --> 22:25.160
So we have a second murder.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.910
Well, technically, it's the first murder.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.680
Given temperature and decomposition,

22:29.680 --> 22:31.350
I'd say he died at least a day

22:31.350 --> 22:33.030
before our lady in the water tank.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.430
Beckett.

22:36.510 --> 22:39.000
So I was going through Blaylock's recent activity.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.670
I found this chat exchange

22:40.670 --> 22:42.340
between him and an anonymous user.

22:42.770 --> 22:43.720
"Changed my mind."

22:43.720 --> 22:45.510
"Can't live like this anymore."

22:45.510 --> 22:47.620
"Will tell you everything I know."

22:48.110 --> 22:49.150
"Where can we meet? "

22:49.150 --> 22:51.550
The person replies, "There's a place near where I'm staying.

22:51.550 --> 22:53.880
Cedric Hotel. Rooftop. At midnight. "

22:53.880 --> 22:55.470
She asked him to meet her up there.

22:55.470 --> 22:57.650
She must have thought it was a location she could control.

22:57.650 --> 22:59.390
Uh, guys, look what time he sent the message.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.470
10: 00 p. m. the night she was murdered.

23:01.470 --> 23:03.220
Right, but according to Lanie's time of death,

23:03.220 --> 23:04.610
Blaylock was already dead.

23:04.610 --> 23:06.910
So this was sent by whoever killed him.

23:07.670 --> 23:09.070
He lured her out.

23:09.070 --> 23:10.480
Then killed her, too.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.560
So the folks at the law firm claim

23:12.560 --> 23:15.260
that they have no idea why anyone would murder Blaylock

23:15.260 --> 23:17.350
Or why Erika was looking for him.

23:17.350 --> 23:19.260
Did they at least tell you why they let Blaylock go?

23:19.260 --> 23:20.820
Only that it was a personal issue.

23:20.820 --> 23:22.440
Well, it must have been pretty serious.

23:22.700 --> 23:23.700
We checked with friends.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.030
Apparently, he was a rising star at the firm

23:26.030 --> 23:27.460
until about a year ago when, out of the blue,

23:27.460 --> 23:29.660
he just became distant and withdrawn.

23:29.660 --> 23:32.160
His marriage fell apart, and he started doing drugs.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.690
It's like something happened.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.900
So Erika was looking into the firm.

23:35.900 --> 23:37.600
Blaylock used to work at the firm.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.250
And now they're both dead.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.600
Why?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.790
Just heard back from Erika's parents.

23:42.790 --> 23:44.520
The law firm rang a bell.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.980
Turns out that Erika's best friend from high school

23:46.980 --> 23:49.730
interned there last summer-- a Pam Bonner.

23:50.050 --> 23:50.580
Okay.

23:50.580 --> 23:52.770
Maybe she can give us some answers.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.280
Where do we find her?

23:54.280 --> 23:56.650
Um, Mount Hope Cemetery in Westchester.

23:56.650 --> 23:58.670
She was killed last summer in a car crash.

23:58.670 --> 23:59.750
What were the circumstances?

23:59.750 --> 24:01.050
Well, there were no witnesses,

24:01.050 --> 24:02.360
but according to the police report,

24:02.360 --> 24:04.620
she was driving home from the firm's summer party.

24:04.620 --> 24:06.880
She lost control and crashed into a tree.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.530
Autopsy indicates that she was intoxicated at the time.

24:09.530 --> 24:11.350
But Erika never believed the official account.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.740
Any reason why?

24:12.740 --> 24:14.490
Well, she believed that Pam would never drive drunk.

24:14.490 --> 24:17.260
And when they found Pam, she was wearing high heels,

24:17.260 --> 24:19.460
and Erika said she never drove in heels.

24:19.820 --> 24:20.680
Three deaths,

24:20.680 --> 24:23.360
all leading back to the law firm of Banks and Bauer.

24:23.990 --> 24:25.530
Is it just me, or is this starting to smell like

24:25.530 --> 24:27.080
a John Grisham novel?

24:27.080 --> 24:29.480
A single-car accident with no witnesses?

24:29.480 --> 24:32.180
Guys, this is a classic conspiracy cover-up.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.500
Though only a lowly intern,

24:34.500 --> 24:36.940
Pam stumbles onto something the firm is doing,

24:36.940 --> 24:39.610
something big, nefarious.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.960
She has to be silenced, only after the accident,

24:41.960 --> 24:45.840
Blaylock can't take the guilt or admit the truth.

24:45.840 --> 24:50.630
So his only bastion is to escape into the sweet oblivion of drugs.

24:50.630 --> 24:52.190
And then when Erika starts coming around,

24:52.190 --> 24:55.440
they realize that they're gonna have to act by eliminating them both.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.490
But what are they covering up?

24:58.020 --> 24:59.060
Whatever it is,

24:59.060 --> 25:01.440
the only possible evidence is on Erika's laptop,

25:01.440 --> 25:02.550
which our killer took.

25:02.550 --> 25:05.580
Yeah. Wait, are we sure about that?

25:05.870 --> 25:08.790
Erika was meeting Blaylock on the roof, right?

25:08.790 --> 25:11.520
A guy who, according to the e-mail, she didn't know very well.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.440
If I'm Erika, I'm hiding that laptop.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.230
Well, we searched her room. It wasn't there.

25:15.230 --> 25:18.780
Wait. Do you guys remember the footage from the elevator?

25:18.980 --> 25:21.430
Yes. She went down to the laundry room first.

25:21.430 --> 25:24.450
And Lanie said that she found traces of creosote under her fingernails

25:24.450 --> 25:26.300
from the boiler room next door.

25:26.300 --> 25:28.430
The laptop's in the basement.

25:34.310 --> 25:36.090
Oh, man. This was Castle's theory.

25:36.090 --> 25:37.500
How'd we draw the short straw?

25:37.500 --> 25:40.320
I don't know. Let me ask you something.

25:41.310 --> 25:43.180
You notice anything weird about Beckett?

25:43.350 --> 25:44.340
What do you mean?

25:45.150 --> 25:49.320
Well, she's... She's different. Something's off.

25:50.030 --> 25:52.760
What are you saying, like, she's pregnant or...

25:53.720 --> 25:55.700
What are you talking about? Where did that even come from?

25:55.830 --> 25:57.360
Well, you said she was acting different.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.690
They're consenting adults--

25:58.690 --> 26:02.020
Beckett is not pregnant. Come on, man.

26:02.580 --> 26:04.080
What's so wrong about being pregnant?

26:04.080 --> 26:06.830
You know, I-I can't even talk to you about this right now.

26:06.830 --> 26:08.660
Okay. Well, um,

26:08.660 --> 26:11.510
Try to get over it before Jenny tells you the news,okay?

26:12.510 --> 26:16.100
What? Are you serious?

26:16.850 --> 26:18.950
Congratulations, man. That's great.

26:18.950 --> 26:20.130
Thanks, man.

26:22.820 --> 26:24.820
Hold up. There's something up here.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.550
- What's that? - That's a laptop.

26:34.050 --> 26:37.390
Okay. No, that's great. Thank you.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.400
So they found the laptop.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.200
I knew it. So what was on it?

26:41.200 --> 26:44.320
Well, the hard drive is encrypted, so techs are going through it now.

26:44.320 --> 26:49.600
Well, somewhere on that computer is a conspiracy of lies so heinous,

26:49.600 --> 26:51.780
So deadly...

26:52.650 --> 26:54.390
- What's this? - What's what?

26:54.870 --> 26:56.230
Boarding pass.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.860
- Castle-- - You fly to D.C. Yesterday?

27:01.150 --> 27:03.500
- Yes, I did. - Why?

27:05.320 --> 27:07.830
I was invited down for an interview.

27:09.350 --> 27:10.600
What kind of interview?

27:10.600 --> 27:14.170
For a position with a federal task force.

27:15.060 --> 27:16.300
I'm sorry.

27:17.350 --> 27:20.330
You interviewed for another job in another city...

27:21.110 --> 27:22.290
and you didn't tell me?

27:22.290 --> 27:25.820
I didn't tell you about it because it was just an interview,

27:25.820 --> 27:28.210
and I knew that you would be upset.

27:29.700 --> 27:32.420
Yeah. Yeah, you're damn right, I'm upset.

27:32.420 --> 27:33.780
Castle, I just wanted to see what was out there.

27:33.780 --> 27:34.630
What's wrong with that?

27:34.630 --> 27:37.830
What's wrong with it is that you hid it from me.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.080
In fact, you lied about it. I wouldn't do that to you.

27:40.080 --> 27:43.770
Castle, this isn't about you. This is about me.

27:43.770 --> 27:45.890
This is about my life.

27:45.890 --> 27:47.290
So you're seriously considering this?

27:47.290 --> 27:49.460
Yes. This is a wonderful opportunity.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.640
It'll be a chance to do more.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.210
Without me.

27:54.470 --> 27:57.700
Castle, please don't do this. Please don't make this about us.

27:57.700 --> 28:00.340
I'm sorry. Tell me how this isn't about us?

28:00.340 --> 28:04.020
You get this job, you move to D.C., I'll never see you.

28:04.020 --> 28:06.360
That's pretty much the end of our relationship, isn't it?

28:06.360 --> 28:07.900
You don't know that.

28:07.900 --> 28:09.590
And I probably won't even get the job.

28:09.590 --> 28:11.080
That's not the point.

28:11.960 --> 28:14.860
The point is, you knew what this could mean

28:14.860 --> 28:17.320
and it didn't occur to you to include me.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.790
Or worse, It did occur to you...

28:21.950 --> 28:23.820
and you chose not to.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.280
Now what does that say about us?

28:28.720 --> 28:30.690
Not much, you ask me.

28:31.690 --> 28:34.900
- Castle-- - I can't be here right now.

28:52.090 --> 28:54.400
- You okay - Yep.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.560
- Where's Castle? - I don't know.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.190
We had a fight, okay?

29:06.190 --> 29:08.120
What, like a regular fight or...

29:10.460 --> 29:11.810
How bad?

29:13.890 --> 29:15.740
Hey, guys. We got something.

29:16.330 --> 29:18.050
Once your victim hacked into the law firm,

29:18.050 --> 29:21.710
she started with the basics-- e-mails, calendars, payroll.

29:21.710 --> 29:24.240
Then she moved on to client and personal files.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.670
Do we know what she was looking for?

29:25.900 --> 29:27.970
Hard to say, but for the last few nights,

29:27.970 --> 29:31.030
Erika became very focused on the firm's accounting department.

29:31.190 --> 29:32.760
The accounting department?

29:32.760 --> 29:34.320
It appears that she was looking into

29:34.320 --> 29:36.630
Ian Blaylock's billable hours records.

29:36.630 --> 29:39.650
Focusing exclusively on one week last summer.

29:40.820 --> 29:41.850
Wait a minute.

29:42.970 --> 29:46.210
That's the same week as Pamela Bonner's car accident.

29:46.210 --> 29:47.310
Right. Now check it out.

29:47.450 --> 29:50.250
The highway patrol determined that Pam Bonner's accident

29:50.250 --> 29:52.560
occurred between 1:30 and 2:00 a.m.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.930
And Ian Blaylock billed for an incoming phone call

29:54.930 --> 29:57.190
from a client at 1:45 a.m.

29:57.190 --> 29:59.560
So you think one of his clients might have been involved?

29:59.560 --> 30:00.760
Maybe ran her off the road?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.330
According to the highway patrol, it was a one-car accident.

30:03.330 --> 30:05.750
You guys, what if Erika was right?

30:05.810 --> 30:08.170
What if Pamela wasn't driving drunk or in her high heels?

30:08.170 --> 30:11.010
In fact, what if Pamela wasn't driving at all?

30:11.010 --> 30:12.390
Someone else was driving,

30:12.390 --> 30:13.490
Someone who crashed

30:13.490 --> 30:15.020
and didn't want to be blamed for Pam's death.

30:15.020 --> 30:17.350
So he put her behind the wheel, fled the scene.

30:17.350 --> 30:18.340
And then called their lawyer.

30:18.340 --> 30:19.920
Who made that phone call to Blaylock?

30:19.920 --> 30:23.160
For security, the firm replaces its clients' names with codes.

30:23.170 --> 30:25.630
This one's 47BGO.

30:25.630 --> 30:27.750
Okay, that firm's never gonna give up that information.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.500
Let's see where else that code shows up.

30:29.500 --> 30:32.270
Cross-reference it, see if we can I.D. our person from there.

30:32.670 --> 30:34.000
You don't have to look too far.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.910
Blaylock billed that very same client

30:35.910 --> 30:38.650
for a round of golf the day after the car crash.

30:38.650 --> 30:40.320
Well, that'd be a perfect place to discuss details.

30:40.320 --> 30:42.090
No one would over hear them.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.450
So according to the starter at the pro shop,

30:44.450 --> 30:46.900
Blaylock was playing golf with another member--

30:46.900 --> 30:49.180
Colin Rigsdale III.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.180
- Of the Rigsdale political family? - Yeah.

30:51.180 --> 30:54.020
Word is daddy's grooming him for a state senate run.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.320
Not if this gets out.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.170
A fatal car crash with a college chick?

30:57.180 --> 30:57.980
Nah, he'd be done.

30:57.980 --> 30:59.170
That's why he was covering it up.

30:59.170 --> 31:00.970
With Blaylock's help until the guilt set in.

31:00.970 --> 31:02.110
And then Erika started poking around,

31:02.110 --> 31:03.080
and people started dying.

31:03.080 --> 31:06.100
It says here Rigsdale's still represented by Banks and Bauer.

31:06.580 --> 31:08.140
Give 'em a call. Tell 'em I'm coming.

31:08.140 --> 31:09.320
Right.

31:11.810 --> 31:13.490
Hey, what's going on? Where's castle?

31:13.490 --> 31:14.620
Don't ask.

31:18.260 --> 31:20.470
Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Rigsdale.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.990
Well, when Jessica told me someone

31:21.990 --> 31:23.140
had hacked into their system,

31:23.140 --> 31:24.980
I was, of course, concerned.

31:25.430 --> 31:28.040
I think we all know what my political opponents might do

31:28.040 --> 31:30.500
if they managed to access confidential information.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.060
So the girl who hacked into our system,

31:32.060 --> 31:33.330
did you find out what she was after?

31:33.330 --> 31:36.340
Yes, and we also believe we know why she was killed.

31:36.340 --> 31:39.410
Are you familiar with a girl named Pamela Bonner?

31:40.790 --> 31:42.720
Detective, what is this about?

31:42.970 --> 31:44.360
Mr. Rigsdale?

31:45.790 --> 31:46.920
The name's not familiar.

31:46.920 --> 31:47.790
Really? I understand that

31:47.790 --> 31:50.480
she was an intern here at the firm last year.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.830
Isn't that correct?

31:51.840 --> 31:53.880
And isn't it also correct that you attended

31:53.880 --> 31:56.980
the Banks and Bauer summer associate party last year?

31:56.980 --> 31:57.810
Don't answer that.

31:57.810 --> 32:00.290
Detective, what are you doing?

32:00.290 --> 32:02.930
The same thing that my victim Erika Albrook was doing,

32:02.930 --> 32:03.920
Trying to figure out

32:03.920 --> 32:06.850
how her best friend Pamela Bonner actually died.

32:06.850 --> 32:08.430
Her death was an accident.

32:08.430 --> 32:09.260
Really?

32:09.750 --> 32:11.620
Then why do we have a record of Ian Blaylock,

32:11.620 --> 32:13.570
Mr. Rigsdale's attorney at the time,

32:13.570 --> 32:17.390
receiving a phone call from him at 1:45 that night?

32:17.990 --> 32:20.120
Detective, this is privileged information.

32:20.120 --> 32:21.240
It's inadmissible.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.600
And we're not in court.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.810
This meeting is over. You need to leave. Now.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.560
Just tell me, how am I supposed to trust her?

32:31.560 --> 32:34.580
How am I even supposed to-- to be in a relationship with her

32:34.590 --> 32:35.630
if she won't let me in?

32:35.630 --> 32:36.370
Well, Richard--

32:36.370 --> 32:39.710
After everything that we've been through together, I...

32:40.350 --> 32:42.100
I just don't understand.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.080
I hate to say it, kiddo, but I do.

32:45.100 --> 32:46.500
Look, the truth is,

32:46.500 --> 32:49.090
Katherine is a bright, ambitious woman.

32:49.090 --> 32:51.840
She should be interviewing for that job.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.310
Whose side are you on?

32:53.320 --> 32:54.790
You want her to put you first

32:54.800 --> 32:56.380
when neither one of you know

32:56.380 --> 32:57.850
where the relationship is going.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.500
Do you know how absurd that is?

32:59.500 --> 33:00.940
I mean, that is as bad

33:00.940 --> 33:04.400
as your not signing that check for Alexis' program.

33:04.400 --> 33:05.880
This isn't about me.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.550
Are you sure?

33:08.520 --> 33:11.730
I know you. You do not hold back.

33:12.820 --> 33:14.520
Except...

33:14.520 --> 33:16.930
This thing with Katherine.

33:16.930 --> 33:19.380
It took you, what, three years to tell her how you felt.

33:19.380 --> 33:21.040
Another year to act on it.

33:21.040 --> 33:24.300
And now, first sign of trouble, you're ready to run.

33:24.380 --> 33:25.500
Why?

33:26.580 --> 33:28.590
Now you're having a good time, you both are,

33:28.590 --> 33:30.280
And I know you say you love her,

33:30.650 --> 33:34.800
But, darling, this is who she is.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.600
So is it possible that the reason you have held back

33:38.600 --> 33:40.730
is because somewhere deep down inside

33:41.110 --> 33:44.590
you don't think this is gonna really work?

33:52.290 --> 33:53.600
I take it he didn't confess.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.930
I didn't need him to.

33:54.930 --> 33:57.730
I just needed to see his eyes. It's him.

33:58.710 --> 34:00.800
Well, the evidence begs to differ.

34:00.810 --> 34:01.990
His prints are in the system

34:02.000 --> 34:04.170
from his arrest at a political protest a decade ago.

34:04.170 --> 34:06.280
I ran 'em against the parti. It's not a match.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.380
And the papers put him at his family's compound in Maine

34:08.380 --> 34:09.340
during Erika's murder.

34:09.340 --> 34:10.989
Yeah, well, he'd never do this himself,

34:10.989 --> 34:13.630
And hiring someone else is too risky for a public figure.

34:13.630 --> 34:16.290
He'd... he'd get a close associate

34:16.290 --> 34:17.570
or a trusted friend to do it.

34:17.570 --> 34:19.760
So why don't we dig in to his life and find out who?

34:19.830 --> 34:20.639
Right.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.389
Beckett.

34:24.600 --> 34:25.739
Detective.

34:26.260 --> 34:28.780
Deputy director Anthony Freedman calling.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.670
You remember? From the interview.

34:30.679 --> 34:32.790
Uh, yes, sir. Yes, I do.

34:32.790 --> 34:35.290
Uh, what can I do for you?

34:35.610 --> 34:37.260
You can say yes.

34:37.270 --> 34:40.170
Detective, you got the job.

34:46.540 --> 34:48.030
Hey, where's Beckett?

34:48.030 --> 34:49.639
She took off about an hour ago.

34:49.639 --> 34:50.880
Something's going on,

34:50.880 --> 34:51.989
but she wouldn't tell me what.

34:53.070 --> 34:55.600
Well, I was looking in to Rigsdale's known associates

34:55.600 --> 34:58.090
and I came across this photo.

34:58.410 --> 35:00.350
That is Martin Tillage, Rigsdale's half brother

35:00.350 --> 35:01.940
and the black sheep of the family.

35:01.940 --> 35:02.870
Look familiar?

35:02.870 --> 35:03.870
Yeah, we interviewed this guy.

35:03.870 --> 35:05.290
He was one of the guests at the Cedric.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.490
He must have checked in to try to find her

35:06.490 --> 35:07.290
and then hung around

35:07.290 --> 35:08.970
so his departure didn't look suspicious.

35:08.980 --> 35:10.520
He's gotta be our guy.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.030
I'll have uniforms pick him up.

35:12.030 --> 35:13.720
- See if you can find Beckett. - Yeah.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.970
It sounds like a great offer.

35:33.850 --> 35:35.420
Yeah, it is.

35:35.990 --> 35:37.600
Your mom would be proud.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.520
Hell, I'm proud.

35:42.290 --> 35:45.000
So... what are you gonna do?

35:45.930 --> 35:47.290
I don't know, dad.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.760
It's like I'm standing at a crossroads

35:51.760 --> 35:54.970
and I have to choose between two possible futures.

35:55.890 --> 35:57.750
Why do you think you have to choose?

35:57.930 --> 36:00.600
Because, dad, he's right.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.830
If I take this job,

36:01.830 --> 36:03.620
then there's not gonna be time for anyone else.

36:03.630 --> 36:04.740
And then if I don't--

36:04.740 --> 36:06.300
It'll be because of him,

36:06.340 --> 36:08.420
and you'll end up resenting him for it.

36:08.680 --> 36:11.150
Or... worse.

36:12.590 --> 36:15.080
Dad, I don't know what we have.

36:15.490 --> 36:18.580
I don't know if it's... real.

36:18.890 --> 36:20.450
It's like we've been doing this dance

36:20.450 --> 36:23.790
for the past five years and...

36:24.250 --> 36:26.950
I mean, what happens when the music stops?

36:27.740 --> 36:30.730
What if all we were in love with was the dance?

36:30.730 --> 36:32.530
You know, your whole life,

36:32.530 --> 36:34.720
you've never had a relationship go this far.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.630
You know, somewhere around here,

36:35.630 --> 36:37.070
you always end them.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.760
Now why is that?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.590
Look, Katie, I know you.

36:42.660 --> 36:43.560
When you get scared,

36:43.560 --> 36:45.230
you hide in your work.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.170
And I just want you to be sure,

36:47.170 --> 36:48.550
whatever decision you make,

36:48.550 --> 36:50.420
It's because it's what you want

36:51.490 --> 36:53.320
Not because you're afraid.

36:56.310 --> 36:57.800
This job...

36:59.040 --> 37:00.610
it's what I want.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.130
Then tell him.

37:05.380 --> 37:07.180
He's gonna hate me, dad.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.430
That's something you'll have to live with.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.490
My last case...

37:29.510 --> 37:31.080
I better go end it.

37:36.260 --> 37:37.620
There you are.

37:37.930 --> 37:40.260
Sorry it took me so long to write it.

37:41.290 --> 37:42.610
Go have fun.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.040
Thanks, dad.

37:48.390 --> 37:49.920
Dad, are you okay?

37:50.470 --> 37:51.760
Yeah.

37:52.710 --> 37:54.180
You seem sad.

37:54.240 --> 37:55.720
No, I'm fine.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.680
It's only Costa Rica.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.070
I'll be back before you know it.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.320
Oh, that's--that's sweet, but, no, it's not about that.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.700
It's, uh...

38:03.790 --> 38:05.640
something your grandmother told me.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.120
There comes a point in our lives

38:08.120 --> 38:10.320
when we have to stop fooling ourselves

38:10.470 --> 38:13.220
into thinking life's gonna be the way we want it to be.

38:14.220 --> 38:16.710
Start seeing things for how they really are.

38:21.540 --> 38:23.620
So I was there. So what?

38:23.650 --> 38:26.750
I needed a place in the city to stay for couple of nights.

38:26.750 --> 38:27.670
Is that a crime?

38:27.670 --> 38:29.710
No, but killing a girl is.

38:30.370 --> 38:32.390
What did your brother promise you, Martin--

38:32.390 --> 38:34.580
Respectability for the black sheep,

38:34.580 --> 38:36.130
a place at the family table?

38:36.130 --> 38:39.290
I told you, I've never seen this girl before in my life.

38:39.290 --> 38:41.910
You're wasting your time.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.240
Do you have any idea how many people

38:48.240 --> 38:51.630
have sat across that table and confessed their sins to me?

38:53.960 --> 38:56.820
What makes you think that you're any different,

38:57.340 --> 38:59.070
any smarter?

39:03.050 --> 39:05.930
You've only been in this room for one hour.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.660
But this room...

39:15.370 --> 39:18.910
This room has been my life...

39:19.580 --> 39:21.200
My home.

39:24.300 --> 39:28.740
And I will not let you sit there and lie to me in my own home.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.990
This is a partial print found at the crime scene

39:33.990 --> 39:35.780
in the victim's blood.

39:36.010 --> 39:38.480
It's a match to yours, Martin.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.690
Am I still wasting my time?

39:43.990 --> 39:45.800
I've got enough to convict you.

39:46.590 --> 39:47.430
So the question is,

39:47.430 --> 39:51.740
How many years of your own life are you gonna sacrifice

39:51.890 --> 39:54.210
for someone else's future?

39:56.720 --> 39:58.300
Or are you ready to deal?

40:18.490 --> 40:20.750
He's prepared to give a statement implicating his brother

40:20.750 --> 40:22.570
in both murders as well as the accident.

40:22.580 --> 40:24.650
Would you guys mind taking it?

40:26.780 --> 40:27.750
Yo, Kate.

40:27.950 --> 40:29.030
Yeah.

40:30.570 --> 40:31.220
What's up?

40:31.220 --> 40:32.610
Yeah, what's going on?

40:35.240 --> 40:37.070
Look, there's something that I have to tell you guys,

40:37.070 --> 40:39.940
but there's someone else that I have to tell first.

40:54.310 --> 40:55.340
Castle.

40:55.340 --> 40:56.330
It's me.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.190
We need to talk.

41:00.790 --> 41:01.880
Yeah, we do.

41:33.910 --> 41:35.360
I'm sorry.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.830
I shouldn't have kept secrets.

41:42.590 --> 41:43.930
It's who you are.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.660
You don't let people in.

41:47.480 --> 41:50.460
I've had to scratch and claw for every inch.

41:50.570 --> 41:51.140
Castle, I--

41:51.140 --> 41:52.640
Please let me finish.

41:55.430 --> 41:56.950
I've been doing a lot of thinking about us,

41:56.950 --> 41:59.910
about our relationship, what we have...

42:00.880 --> 42:02.390
where we're headed.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.690
I've decided I want more.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.330
We both deserve more.

42:18.980 --> 42:20.130
I agree.

42:22.930 --> 42:24.670
So whatever happens...

42:26.830 --> 42:28.460
and whatever you decide...

42:30.480 --> 42:32.130
Katherine Houghton Beckett...

42:35.720 --> 42:37.380
Will you marry me?

42:38.305 --> 42:44.914
