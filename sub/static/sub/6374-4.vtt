Qianqing

00:03.300 --> 00:04.500
I was at your father's funeral.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.700
I bet you're just like him.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.800
No... i'm not.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.500
Partial retrograde amnesia?

00:10.500 --> 00:12.400
She doesn't even remember
becoming a woman.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.200
I wanted you to know that i talked
to charlie, and she admitted everything.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.100
????

00:16.100 --> 00:17.600
We're gonna do
a paternity test.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.000
I am freakin'????

00:20.000 --> 00:21.600
You are not an orphan.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.800
I need to find my father

00:23.800 --> 00:25.600
I'm gonna enroll
in a writing class.
Great.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.800
I'm gonna be a writer.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.400
Anybody here?
Dad?

00:29.300 --> 00:30.600
We missed you.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.600
(Man) "she kissed me,
but her lips were cold.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.700
"I could never tell her
that i'd loved her all along.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
"She left for dusseldorf
that morning...

00:41.300 --> 00:42.800
With my heart
in her backpack."

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
-==Http://www.Ragbear.Com==-

00:57.200 --> 00:58.600
Applause? Really?

00:59.300 --> 01:00.500
What did u told the class?

01:00.500 --> 01:03.200
Why you like so much
about this piece?

01:05.600 --> 01:08.600
Well, um, it was sweet,

01:08.600 --> 01:10.600
And i really felt his pain.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.500
Here's what i felt.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.800
This class is called
"finding your voice."

01:24.100 --> 01:25.700
It's for serious writers,

01:25.700 --> 01:28.600
Not emotionally stunted
dilettantes!

01:28.900 --> 01:30.800
I expect you people
to dig deeper!

01:30.800 --> 01:33.300
Open those old wounds!

01:33.300 --> 01:35.100
And if there are no old wounds,

01:35.600 --> 01:36.800
Well, i always say,

01:37.300 --> 01:40.500
"If you have nothing to write,
try killing yourself.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.200
"If you fail, you'll have
something to write about.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.600
If you succeed,
your troubles will be over."

01:46.600 --> 01:50.900
Next week, a thousand words
on your most defining moment.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.800
And you, clappy.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.500
I'll be very interested
in what you have to say.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.900
He called you "clappy"?

02:03.900 --> 02:05.700
Yes. He's mean.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.300
Like simon cowell,
but with a pulitzer,

02:08.300 --> 02:10.199
And i can't just
be jordin sparks good,

02:10.199 --> 02:13.700
I have to be kelly clarkson,
"miss independt" good.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.300
I don't know
any of those people,

02:15.300 --> 02:18.600
But i read your story,
and it was an a-Plus.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.400
Dad, you like
everything i do.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.500
When i was 10, youold me
i could  a model.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.700
You could be a model.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.800
A guy in a car once
told me i could be a model.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.100
I know, hilda, i stopped you
from getting in that car.

02:28.100 --> 02:28.800
Oh, yeah.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.900
This is class
is phase one of my career.

02:30.900 --> 02:34.300
I write, i get published,
i work my way to editor,

02:34.300 --> 02:36.000
And then
i can run a magazine.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.900
And then you
really will need a model.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.200
See, i shoulda
got in that car.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.800
It's not a joke, hilda.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.700
If i can't even
get through this class,

02:43.700 --> 02:45.600
Then my whole career
is out the window.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.400
Eetheart, you had
straight a's in high school.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.400
You graduated top of your class
at queens college.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.900
Yeah, but that's not
the real world,

02:52.900 --> 02:54.800
Which is why
i sent my sty to daniel.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.000
He does this for a living.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.300
He'll know if it's good...

02:58.700 --> 03:00.400
Or if i'm gonna get voted off.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.700
Hey, kiddo.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.900
That, uh,
jacket's kinda big.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.400
It was dad's.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.000
It's badass.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.800
So, justin,
how was your math test?

03:24.800 --> 03:25.900
Kinda flunked it.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.400
Whatevs. It's only
the first test of the year. It doesn't matter.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.100
Oh, come on. When was the last
time you ever used algebra?

03:36.400 --> 03:37.600
Why do you defend him?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.100
He's never gotten an "f" before,
not even in gym.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.800
Which he calls "the unhappy hour"

03:41.800 --> 03:44.300
He will make up the test
something.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.700
It's no big deal.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.000
(Alexis) this whole woman thing
is hard.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.100
It took me an hour and a half
to do this makeup.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.200
I used everything i had.
You're supposed to, right?

03:57.300 --> 03:59.200
I... think you can

03:59.200 --> 04:01.500
Probably save some
for tomorrow.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.700
I knew it was too much.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.500
Sorry.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.700
Still not used to heels.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.800
I need more practice.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.400
Maybe i should've stayed home.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.200
Come on. The doctor said
the best thing for your memory--

04:18.200 --> 04:19.500
Familiar surroundings.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.300
I know you don't remember
the last two years,

04:22.300 --> 04:24.300
But i know youemember
being alex.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.000
He was a fantastic editor.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.400
(Sighs) but in fashion,two years is a life time

04:30.300 --> 04:33.200
Plus, now i'm the new guy.
I mean, chick.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.900
Do chicks say "chick"?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.700
And why is everyone
staring at my chest?

04:38.700 --> 04:40.900
I don't know. You might
waa button another button,

04:40.900 --> 04:42.800
Maybe try a bra.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.800
It's boobs. It's crazy.
Th're everywhere.

04:47.700 --> 04:51.300
Oh, honey, no, no, no.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.600
Ladies' room, now.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.800
Friends don't let friends
wear glitter before noon.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.800
Yeah. Yeah.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.900
This is... phat.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.900
What'd i tell you?
And as soon as this baby drops,

05:10.900 --> 05:12.700
I'm gonna bust out
of accounting, man.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.800
I'm-A be chillin' under
rihanna's umbrella--Ella.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.000
Oh, uh, super phat.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.500
(Betty) here's my time card.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.200
Uh-Oh,ady parts, 12:00.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.400
I don't know
how you do it, man.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.400
????

05:26.400 --> 05:29.000
You gotta teach me, young skywalker. Come on!

05:29.300 --> 05:32.300
Obi-Wan's the t--Never mind.
Just get out of here.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.600
Hey, henry.
Hey.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.200
Kenny.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.000
Betty. I'm just gonna
give you two some space here.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.500
So i was wondering--
(Kenny) save it, boney.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.000
Charlie hasn't heard back yet
about the paternity test.

05:43.000 --> 05:43.900
Dude!

05:43.900 --> 05:47.500
What? Sound does not stop
right here, man.
Would you just...

05:48.500 --> 05:50.600
Actually, i'm not here
to talk about us...

05:50.700 --> 05:51.500
For a change.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.600
It's justin.
He's failing algebra.
What?

05:54.600 --> 05:57.100
So i was thinking, sce
you're, like, a math genius,

05:57.100 --> 05:58.600
Uh, maybe
you could tutor him?

05:58.600 --> 06:00.900
Sure. Definitely.
He needs his algebra.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.400
I mean,
we use it every day.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.800
Great. Okay. Thank you.

06:06.500 --> 06:11.200
Um, so... i guess
i'll see you later?

06:11.500 --> 06:12.200
Yeah.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.000
Okay.

06:16.700 --> 06:17.800
Forget something?

06:17.800 --> 06:18.700
Bye, kenny.

06:20.100 --> 06:24.200
(Singsongy) i'm just looking
for some shoes.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.300
Ah.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.500
Mandy! You can't just leave
the reception desk empty.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.100
Oh, my god. Are you making out
with that dog again?

06:38.100 --> 06:40.100
Halston and i
needed a little me time.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.300
Searching for our real father
is exhausting.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Cai spoon, too?

06:46.900 --> 06:48.700
So i'm guessing no luck
finding daddy?

06:48.700 --> 06:49.600
Nada.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.500
I googled fey.
I searched this stupid room.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.000
I read her diary.
It's useless.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.200
So fey never mentioned
any men?

06:57.200 --> 06:58.600
Not a word.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.600
Maybe we need
to find some pictures.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.700
Every month,
the back page of "mode"

07:05.700 --> 07:07.900
Was filled with pictures
of fey at dierent parties.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.900
Go find some old issues

07:09.900 --> 07:13.000
And see who fey was socializing
with the year of your birth.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.400
Wait.
What year were you born?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.700
1991.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.400
You're 16?

07:19.600 --> 07:20.400
1992.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.400
Other way.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.700
Now i'm moving up
the british new rave piece.

07:26.700 --> 07:29.500
I want a rrite
on "the five ways to fake it,"

07:29.500 --> 07:32.100
And, phillip,
the trash can is going to enjoy

07:32.100 --> 07:35.900
Your snooze-Inducing profile
on sienna miller.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.200
Look who's back,
everyone.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.700
(Wilhelmina) oh! Alexis.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.300
So good to seeou, darling.
You... look fabulous.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.800
(Whispers)
i'm not wearing a bra.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
Ah. Power move.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.500
I thought we could bring
alexis up to speed on the january issue.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
(Clears throat) and i just want
to thank everyone in advance

07:53.500 --> 07:55.800
For helping me cope
with my disability.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.400
Just bear with me.

07:57.700 --> 08:01.200
Well, uh, the january issue
is our ready-To-Wear issue.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.500
Our chief advertiser
is atlantic attire,

08:04.500 --> 08:06.800
And we will be featuring
the spring collection.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.500
Sorry to interrupt,???

08:08.500 --> 08:10.600
Do you mind scooting down?
You know, so...

08:14.400 --> 08:15.300
Of course.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.400
You are the coeditors.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.900
You know, you should get
used to not having me around.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.400
As we all know,
in a few weeks,

08:25.400 --> 08:29.700
I will be leaving "mode"
to help run meade publications

08:29.800 --> 08:31.200
And the meade family.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.200
So, uh, sheila,
uh, future creative director,

08:37.200 --> 08:39.400
Why don't you
just take it away?

08:40.700 --> 08:41.500
Toodles.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.400
What a pleasant surprise.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.700
This isn't about the wedding,
is it?

08:51.700 --> 08:55.100
No, i came up to talk to you about
my new position at the company.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.200
Now i'm thinking,
after the wedding...

08:58.200 --> 09:00.000
Well, what--What's
with that look?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.500
Oh, i'm just a bit surprised,
that's all.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.400
I didn't think
you'd be coming in that often.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.600
Claire always spent her days--
Drinking and murdering fey?

09:06.600 --> 09:10.400
Well, your ex-Wife and i
are very different women.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.500
In case you haven't noticed,
i'm a career g.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.400
You know
i likeo be hands-On.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.300
And that's
what i le about you.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.300
Unh-Unh-Unh.
Business first.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.400
Well, as cochair of meade,

09:24.400 --> 09:28.200
You could have creative control
of any magazine you like, apart from--

09:28.200 --> 09:30.300
"Mode." I know.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.300
Claire has
made that impossible.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.400
There are 22 other publications
in this building.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.400
Well, perhaps i should
familiarize myself with them.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.500
Absolutely.
Talk to the editors.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.900
They're the people you're gonna
be spending your time with.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.900
Now in the meantime,
there is something over here

09:45.900 --> 09:49.300
That you could be
a little more hands-On with.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.400
(Sheila) and that's our
travel feature for ts month.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.000
Great.
So who's the cover?

09:59.000 --> 10:03.400
Well, actually, we might have
lost winona ryr to a movie.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.300
Not re whether she's making
one or just going to see one.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.200
I have an idea.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.200
Great.
Alexis, let's hear it.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.300
Well, um,
when i was at hudson,

10:16.300 --> 10:19.700
Uh, everyone was doing
johnny depp, brad pitt.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.300
We did bill murray
right before "rushmore."

10:22.700 --> 10:25.400
This is a great opportunity
for a comeback.
(Sheila) really?

10:25.400 --> 10:28.600
Readers love the underdog.
Listen and learn, people.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.000
She's big.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.600
She's sexy.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.600
She's outrageous.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.200
Anna nicole smith.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.400
Bam!

10:44.800 --> 10:45.900
Hey, there y are.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.400
(Crying)
are you crying?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.300
I'm a girl.
I'm allowed to now.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.900
I made a fool of myself
in there.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
You know what?

10:57.800 --> 10:59.600
Maybe we are
rushing this thing.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.800
Why don't you
take tomorrow off?

11:02.800 --> 11:04.000
But we have
that photo shoot

11:04.000 --> 11:06.500
And the meeting
with atlantic attire and...

11:07.800 --> 11:09.500
Something else. I forget.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.500
Damn it!
I forget everything!

11:11.500 --> 11:12.400
Hey, hey.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.900
Come on.
You're gonna be fine.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.200
You need to trust
your instincts.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.400
You are
doing everything right.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.800
Oh, and by the way,
you're in the men's room.
(Laughs)

11:28.300 --> 11:31.200
Daniel, i called luke carnes
at atlantic attire,

11:31.200 --> 11:33.300
Told him you'll be attending
the meeting without alexis.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.900
Here's his bio and all his
previous advertising layouts.

11:35.900 --> 11:38.000
Also, your personal trainer
got ved to 2:00.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.600
And you do know en i say
"personal trainer,"

11:39.600 --> 11:40.800
That's code for...
(whispers) pedicure.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.800
I know, betty. ????

11:42.800 --> 11:44.100
Hm.
Oh, and one more thing.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.100
I need you to read these
female empowerment articles.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.200
Let me know what you think.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.600
I heard the bear one's
pretty good.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.800
You know, i would do it,
but i ha my, uh, book club.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.000
And when you say "book club,"
that's code for "hot date."

11:54.000 --> 11:56.900
Really, betty? I mean, what's
the poinin having codes?

11:59.400 --> 12:02.600
So, uh,
i have plans tonight, too.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.600
Going to my writing class.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.900
Really? Great.

12:07.500 --> 12:08.300
Have fun.

12:08.300 --> 12:11.100
I will. You know, uh,
reading my essay?

12:11.900 --> 12:13.600
Out loud, for everyone?

12:13.600 --> 12:14.600
Cool.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.700
I'm such an idiot.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.100
Your essay, of course.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.900
It's great work.
I gave you a gold star.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.400
Really loved it.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.800
He hated it.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.100
But i thought
he said it was great?

12:33.100 --> 12:35.300
What's the problem?
Well, he did,

12:35.300 --> 12:38.300
But he gave me that fake smile
and the thumbs-Up.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.200
He always does that
when he's lying.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.700
Hey. Call me lat.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.100
Oh, definitely.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.100
(Bradford) did you read the quarterly
competite analysis?

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
Veti.????

12:51.900 --> 12:53.100
Ready, slave?

12:53.800 --> 12:54.600
Okay.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.200
But i mes , th. Idaniel

12:58.200 --> 13:01.100
He's not exactly the arbiter
of great literature, is he?

13:01.100 --> 13:03.700
Let's face it. The only reason
he's here is because of his dad.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.500
Well, maybe it started that way,
but he's proven himself.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.200
Daniel is very smart...

13:10.100 --> 13:12.100
In a high five kinda way,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.600
And he's the first person
who ever believed in me,

13:14.600 --> 13:16.200
So ????

13:16.200 --> 13:18.700
Oh, sweetheart, i'm sure
your story is lovely.

13:18.700 --> 13:19.900
What's it about again?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.200
I wrote about staying home
on prom night.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.000
Oh, wow.
That sounds really sweet.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.800
<I>no. The professor
wants grim and tortured.</I>

13:27.800 --> 13:30.600
Damn it!
Why do i have to be so sweet?

13:30.600 --> 13:32.100
"I saw the sun rise
over the valley

13:32.100 --> 13:33.800
"For the first time
in ten years,

13:34.300 --> 13:35.600
And i knew i was home."

13:38.000 --> 13:38.800
The end.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.500
Yes, jeremy, it is the end.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.800
The end of literature.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.800
Oh, god. Ionly i hadn't blown
that pulitzer money

13:46.800 --> 13:48.200
At the indian casino.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.400
Let the tortur continue.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.800
You'rep, crappy.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.100
Actually, it's...

14:00.200 --> 14:01.100
Clappy.

14:19.500 --> 14:22.800
I hope your thoughts are
better organized than your bag.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.000
All right! There aren't
enough hours in the day!

14:27.200 --> 14:31.000
"When i saw my blood dripping
off the bear's teeth... "

14:34.700 --> 14:36.100
You stop now?

14:37.800 --> 14:40.500
For the first time today,
i wasn't bored.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.600
Read. Read!
Start with the title!

14:49.700 --> 14:53.600
"Girl gone wild: how i survived
a bear attack."

14:56.400 --> 14:57.800
By betty suarez.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.300
So if the hemlines in fall 2001

15:13.300 --> 15:15.300
Were 6 inches below the knee,

15:15.300 --> 15:19.000
And the hemlin in fall 2006
were 2 inches above the knee,

15:19.000 --> 15:22.500
What will the hemlines be
in 2012, given the current rate?

15:23.300 --> 15:24.800
Who cares?

15:24.800 --> 15:25.400
Oh.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.400
I thought you liked
all this fashion stuff.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.800
Uh... let's find
something else.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.100
What--What are you into
these days?

15:33.100 --> 15:34.300
Not algebra.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.300
Okay.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.300
Well, um, good work today.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.700
See you tomorrow.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.800
So, mr. Suarez,

15:48.200 --> 15:50.200
Will betty be home soon?

15:52.300 --> 15:53.400
You're here for justin.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.300
Let's keep it about that.

15:57.700 --> 15:58.400
Sure.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.800
"And as i write this,

16:03.100 --> 16:03.900
"Pregnant...

16:04.600 --> 16:06.600
"With my first child...

16:07.600 --> 16:10.700
I realize
i survived for a reason."

16:19.800 --> 16:20.300
That...

16:20.460 --> 16:24.590
Was exactly what i've been looking for.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.290
Why can't the rest of you get attacked by a bear?

16:27.450 --> 16:30.320
Your assignment for this week is to live dangerously.

16:30.470 --> 16:33.590
Stop a knife fight. Take a bone from a pit bull.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.190
Now!

16:37.110 --> 16:39.310
Suarez!

16:41.280 --> 16:43.020
Nice work.

16:43.290 --> 16:45.870
It was worth almost having your ear torn off.

16:46.030 --> 16:48.770
Just out of perverse curiosity,

16:50.320 --> 16:51.030
May i see it?

16:51.190 --> 16:54.590
No. I'm very self-Conscious.

16:54.730 --> 16:55.840
I thought it was your right ear.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.720
It is. When the bear was done with this one,

16:59.870 --> 17:02.140
He started nibbling on that one. (Chuckles)

17:10.390 --> 17:12.030
Stupid bear.

17:12.180 --> 17:14.349
Stupid class.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.530
Oh.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.660
(High-Pitched male voice) you lying bitch.

17:20.810 --> 17:22.420
Poquito?

17:23.050 --> 17:24.329
Is that you?

17:24.480 --> 17:27.640
Yeah,that's right. The bear's talking.

17:27.790 --> 17:29.410
You didn't write that story.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.100
You stole it.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.550
I didn't mean to. It was a mistake.

17:33.710 --> 17:35.730
Betty suarez is a cheater.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.570
They laugh at me every day at "mode."

17:37.720 --> 17:40.300
I didn't want them laughing at me in class,too,poquito.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.280
Wanna know

17:41.420 --> 17:44.570
What a bear attack really feels like,betty?

17:46.570 --> 17:48.790
Poquito!

17:49.890 --> 17:52.180
No! No!

17:56.560 --> 17:58.930
(Wilhelmina) oh,marcie.

17:59.090 --> 18:00.760
Yes???

18:00.910 --> 18:01.900
Fix your makeup,doll.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.980
We're heading up to the executive suite,

18:04.130 --> 18:06.260
Where every magazine in the meade empire

18:06.410 --> 18:09.930
Is coming to kiss the ring of the new cochair.

18:12.190 --> 18:14.250
"Adventure time" is extreme,

18:14.410 --> 18:16.760
Extremely extreme.

18:16.910 --> 18:19.680
It's base jumping off the space needle. Huh!

18:19.830 --> 18:22.360
It's surfing a tsunami. Huh!

18:22.720 --> 18:25.970
It's basically anything that breaks bones or cracks teeth.

18:26.130 --> 18:29.220
Our readers won't be satisfied until they've slammed into...

18:29.370 --> 18:31.150
A chocolate souffl?

18:31.230 --> 18:34.620
????

18:34.780 --> 18:39.630
Ooh! And february's issu is devoted eirely to...

18:39.790 --> 18:41.070
Crème fraîche!

18:41.230 --> 18:43.590
Because we here at "cucina" believe that crème fraîche

18:43.750 --> 18:45.260
Belongs on...

18:45.420 --> 18:47.170
Boobs.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.630
That's what our 30-Something straight male demo wants to see.

18:50.780 --> 18:53.560
You're a talented lady. You could do this in your sleep.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.130
Slap a hottie on the cover, throw in some articles

18:56.290 --> 18:59.220
On fast cars, video games and guns,

18:59.380 --> 19:02.670
And pop! You're ney.

19:04.110 --> 19:07.360
Oh! The sml of prada!

19:08.030 --> 19:09.120
(Sniffs) there's no place le home.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.980
This isn't our home anymore, marc. We have no home.

19:12.130 --> 19:14.360
I'm gonna be stuck upstairs in that executive suite

19:14.490 --> 19:17.970
Dealing with those commoners. Willie,think we may have made a terrible mistake.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.200
I know. All i wanted to do was run a fashion magazine.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.810
I s a simple girl with an evil plan.

19:23.970 --> 19:25.260
Fashion is our passion!

19:25.420 --> 19:27.650
But meade only has one fashion magazine,

19:27.800 --> 19:29.060
And it will never be mine.

19:29.220 --> 19:33.510
Oh! We're doomed! Doomed!

19:33.890 --> 19:36.340
Off the floor,marc.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.720
No,your instincts were right. Fall again.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.220
Doomed!

20:00.330 --> 20:02.760
(Daniel) i heard you're a cheater. What?

20:02.920 --> 20:05.950
I said,i'm out of sweetener. Can you grab me some downstairs?

20:06.110 --> 20:08.950
Oh. Yeah.

20:09.510 --> 20:11.700
Hey,what's your bunny doing in the...

20:13.800 --> 20:15.620
(Ring) daniel meade's office.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.370
This is professor barrett. Is this betty suarez?

20:18.520 --> 20:19.270
No.

20:20.180 --> 20:20.550
Yes.

20:20.700 --> 20:24.900
Come see me at 2:00. We need to discuss your essay.

20:30.710 --> 20:32.430
So,luke,i'll talk to our advertisers,

20:32.580 --> 20:35.000
But i can pretty much promise atlantic attire

20:35.140 --> 20:38.160
Ten pages in our january issue at cut rate.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.070
Good to be in business with you,danny boy,

20:41.230 --> 20:42.520
And i like your style,too.

20:42.690 --> 20:44.360
Just one thing i need you to help me out with,though,

20:44.520 --> 20:46.980
Before i sign a big,fat check. Anything. Hit me.

20:47.140 --> 20:49.450
It's about your sister. I didn't realize she would be

20:49.610 --> 20:51.770
Coming back to work, aftethe accident and all.

20:51.930 --> 20:53.340
Yeah, she really pulled through.

20:53.490 --> 20:55.390
I mean,we're excited to have her back.

20:55.550 --> 20:59.010
Yeah,see,that's the problem. Atlantic attire is innocent.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.310
I'm not sure we want to be associated

21:00.450 --> 21:03.900
With a magazine run by a cross-Dresser. Are you kidding with this?

21:04.070 --> 21:06.540
Aw,come on. D't be all, "he's a hater."

21:06.680 --> 21:08.330
I am the most tolerant man in town.

21:08.470 --> 21:09.750
I got a black and a jew assistant,all right?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.880
And the gays? Couldn't have an oscar party without 'em.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.730
But i am a businessman. I got a company i'm trying to brand.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.610
I got a hundred stores i'm opening next month.

21:17.780 --> 21:18.910
I can't afford to be associated

21:19.080 --> 21:23.640
With the whole he/she element. Are you asking me to fire my own sister to get your account?

21:23.790 --> 21:26.430
Dude,it sucks. I get it.

21:26.590 --> 21:29.210
I had to give up the... (sniffs) you know what i'm saying?

21:29.370 --> 21:30.250
But these,my brother,

21:30.410 --> 21:32.440
Are the sacrifices we gotta make for the bottom line.

21:32.610 --> 21:35.160
You think about it and you get back to me.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.290
Ms. Suarez.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.860
Professor barrett, i can explain.

21:49.020 --> 21:50.610
It's very rare to find someone

21:50.760 --> 21:54.360
Who can be so honest about their experience

21:54.740 --> 21:57.350
This class is all about finding your voice,

21:57.500 --> 22:01.810
And,well, consider yours found.

22:02.430 --> 22:03.990
It is?

22:04.760 --> 22:06.730
Your story moved me so much,

22:06.880 --> 22:10.000
I just cldn'tbear to keep it to myself.

22:10.150 --> 22:13.140
And that was not a pun. I never pun.

22:13.300 --> 22:14.710
So what are you saying?

22:14.860 --> 22:16.300
I sent it to a colleague,

22:16.460 --> 22:18.600
An editor at "e new york review."

22:18.750 --> 22:22.800
He'd like to see you... today.

22:23.340 --> 22:24.980
Well,well,it...

22:25.140 --> 22:27.200
But... but i...

22:27.360 --> 22:31.150
U really do save it for the page,don't you?

22:34.600 --> 22:36.260
I know you told me not to come in today,

22:36.410 --> 22:38.150
But after spending the day playing with makeup,

22:38.310 --> 22:41.300
I think i finally got it right.

22:41.620 --> 22:43.990
So i came ino show it off.

22:44.730 --> 22:45.950
How'd the meeting with the advertiser go?

22:46.110 --> 22:47.130
Yeah,great.

22:47.280 --> 22:50.100
Don't give me e smile and the thumb.

22:50.270 --> 22:53.910
Okay. The truth?

22:55.130 --> 22:57.020
I think i lost the account.

22:57.190 --> 22:57.840
Why?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.960
The guy had some issue with our staff. What? With who?

23:01.120 --> 23:03.360
Doesn't matter. It's not his place.

23:03.530 --> 23:06.870
Daniel, who are you protecting?

23:11.600 --> 23:13.240
You.

23:13.470 --> 23:16.520
<I>me? What did i ever do to him?</I>

23:21.660 --> 23:23.480
Oh. I get it.

23:23.650 --> 23:25.190
He doesn't want to sign with "mode"

23:25.350 --> 23:28.140
Because the coeditor-In-Chief is...

23:31.800 --> 23:33.790
Like this.

23:34.810 --> 23:36.400
Hey,hey. Where are you going?

23:36.560 --> 23:38.310
Maybe i should have just stayed home after all.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.320
It's one advertiser. Don't let it get to you.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.690
It's not worth it. No,i'm not worth it. Look at me,i'm a mess.

23:43.850 --> 23:45.180
I drove away that advertiser.

23:45.350 --> 23:47.520
I practically killed us both in that accident.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.050
I told you, that wasn't your fault.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.020
Yes,it was! I can't do anything right.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.930
I can't drive. I cat do my job.

23:55.770 --> 23:59.250
Uh! And i can't freakin' walk in these!

24:03.330 --> 24:05.680
(Marc) i'm okay.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.720
Come on,halston. Help me out here.

24:12.890 --> 24:14.920
I'm trying to find our daddy.

24:15.070 --> 24:17.670
Just bark if you see someone you recognize.

24:17.840 --> 24:23.020
Ooh. "Mousse-- The 'it' beauty product." (Whimps)

24:23.190 --> 24:26.070
I heart the '80s.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.930
What is it,boy?

24:35.920 --> 24:37.730
(Gasps) "editor-In-Chief, fey sommers,

24:37.880 --> 24:41.050
And her assistant,wanda, the palladium."

24:41.200 --> 24:43.470
Who the hell is wanda?

24:46.550 --> 24:48.460
Okay,slim the nose,

24:48.600 --> 24:51.190
Add about 20 years,

24:51.340 --> 24:53.350
A little botox.

24:53.510 --> 24:56.180
Yes,yes.

24:58.060 --> 25:01.230
Oh... my... dog.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.620
(Barks) ugly willie.

25:04.780 --> 25:07.230
What did you just call me?

25:13.920 --> 25:16.710
You're saying no to "the new york revw"?

25:16.870 --> 25:20.390
<I>"the new york revie?</I>

25:20.920 --> 25:23.690
Do you have any idea how many doors this could open for you?

25:23.850 --> 25:26.140
I'm sorry,but i...

25:26.480 --> 25:27.740
I can't.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.530
The truth is... (telephone rings)

25:31.180 --> 25:32.130
Hello?

25:32.290 --> 25:33.630
Yes,i'm sitting with her right now.

25:33.790 --> 25:36.950
It's the legal department. What? But no one's done anything illegal.

25:37.110 --> 25:38.130
We don't need lawyers.

25:38.300 --> 25:42.720
It's just a routine fact check on your piece. Uh-Huh.

25:42.880 --> 25:47.220
No. I haven'seen the ear yet.

25:47.740 --> 25:49.350
Now what do i need to do

25:49.510 --> 25:51.270
To convince you to let us print your piece?

25:51.420 --> 25:55.000
Sir,what i am trying to tell you is that...

25:55.930 --> 25:57.980
I work at "mode."

25:58.130 --> 26:00.280
That thing with the clothes.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.880
Yes,and if i were to let a competing magazine

26:03.040 --> 26:05.320
Print my article without giving them first look,

26:05.470 --> 26:07.460
Then they would fire me.

26:07.850 --> 26:10.340
Definitely,they would fire me.

26:10.510 --> 26:11.180
We couldn't let that happen

26:11.340 --> 26:13.460
To someone who's expecting, now could we?

26:13.610 --> 26:15.130
Expecting?

26:15.290 --> 26:18.190
Oh! Yes,of course, my baby.

26:18.350 --> 26:20.590
Well,thank you.

26:20.740 --> 26:23.420
That is very kind.

26:24.790 --> 26:27.400
You're carrying low.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.460
It's a boy.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.660
I can always tell.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.800
Thank you.

26:38.470 --> 26:40.520
Interesting fact-- Drop a penny

26:40.680 --> 26:43.740
And a blonde receptionist from the 28th floor,

26:43.900 --> 26:46.840
And they both hit the sidewalk at the same time.

26:46.990 --> 26:48.200
I believe they call it,

26:48.360 --> 26:51.190
Uh,terminal velocity.

26:51.350 --> 26:52.610
Okay,i think

26:52.770 --> 26:55.090
This is a really good time to point out...

26:55.320 --> 26:58.100
(Lowers voice) that i am not a real blonde.

27:00.510 --> 27:03.340
I thght i had gotten rid of all the pictures of wanda.

27:03.490 --> 27:04.600
Apparently,i missed one.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.640
I ll never speak of this again.

27:06.790 --> 27:10.300
I don't even remember what we're talking about right now.

27:13.300 --> 27:15.110
Okay,look,the only reason

27:15.250 --> 27:17.460
I was looking at old pictures of fey

27:17.630 --> 27:22.550
Is because i'm trying to figure out who my real father is.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.040
Even if i wanted to express sympathy,

27:24.180 --> 27:26.980
I physically can't.

27:27.140 --> 27:30.120
Okay,so... if you're not gonna hurt me,

27:30.280 --> 27:33.160
Then i'll just...

27:36.630 --> 27:39.800
There's just one more thing.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.860
According to the date on those photos,

27:42.000 --> 27:46.070
You were my mother's assistant during her pregnancy.

27:46.450 --> 27:48.550
Oh,please,wilhelmina.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.790
You're my last hope.

27:50.960 --> 27:54.950
Is there any chance that you know who my father is?

27:55.360 --> 27:59.480
April 26,1981.

27:59.630 --> 28:01.380
Studio 54.

28:01.530 --> 28:04.500
<I>it was the early days of glam rock fashion.</I>

28:04.650 --> 28:06.400
<I>liza's between gay husbands,

28:06.560 --> 28:09.390
<I>and the party celebrating fey's first issue of "mode"

28:09.540 --> 28:11.370
<I>is in full swing.</I>

28:13.260 --> 28:14.740
<I>it's snowing everywhere,

28:14.900 --> 28:17.250
????

28:19.060 --> 28:21.510
<I>i quicck oy lor.Raf he

28:21.650 --> 28:24.770
<I>then i hear fey's distinctive laugh.</I>

28:27.560 --> 28:28.540
<I>i didn't see anything

28:28.700 --> 28:31.700
<I>but the tweety bird tattoo on his ass.</I>

28:38.300 --> 28:41.140
I was conceived during studio 54?

28:41.310 --> 28:43.180
I knew there was glamour in my genes.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.660
When fey started puking up her breakfast,

28:45.820 --> 28:47.540
She was thrilled...

28:47.700 --> 28:50.320
Until she realized she was pregnant.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.980
She swore me to secrecy,

28:52.150 --> 28:54.700
And in exchange, paid for my transfmation

28:54.860 --> 28:59.000
From mousy assistant wanda

28:59.170 --> 29:01.210
Into supermodel wilhelmina.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.460
So you know who he is?

29:03.620 --> 29:04.680
No.

29:06.470 --> 29:08.310
Oh.

29:09.710 --> 29:12.010
Thanks anyway.

29:12.630 --> 29:14.230
Amanda.

29:14.390 --> 29:18.380
I've done a lot to put wanda behind me.

29:18.540 --> 29:21.010
Your secres safe with me.

29:24.440 --> 29:28.950
I've put my blood,
sweat and old nose into this place.

29:29.110 --> 29:31.440
If i can't have "mode,"

29:31.610 --> 29:33.670
No one else can.

29:44.970 --> 29:47.680
Daniel,i want to talk
to you about luke carnes.

29:47.840 --> 29:48.890
I already know what you're gonna say.

29:49.040 --> 29:53.860
I have nintention of asking alexis to step down.
You underestimate me, daniel.

29:54.010 --> 29:56.920
I think we should lo the account. What?

29:57.070 --> 29:59.700
We don't need atlantic attire or their money.

29:59.860 --> 30:03.570
We have dozens of other loyal advertisers.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.160
Why would you back me on this?

30:06.330 --> 30:08.700
(Sighs) daniel, whether you like it or not,

30:08.850 --> 30:11.380
We're about to become a family,

30:11.540 --> 30:14.340
And family sticks together.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.630
Soluke,

30:22.800 --> 30:24.930
Let's talk about this account.

30:25.100 --> 30:26.050
Where do i sign?

30:26.210 --> 30:27.960
Actually,uh,you don't.

30:28.120 --> 30:32.280
You see,"mode" doesn't need to be associated with bigots.

30:32.430 --> 30:35.480
You're turning down ten pages for a man in a skirt?

30:35.610 --> 30:38.870
That man is my sister.

30:41.970 --> 30:45.580
Dude,i'm trying to help you out.

30:45.730 --> 30:49.250
I don't need your help, dude.

31:02.450 --> 31:03.010
Oh! Oh!

31:03.170 --> 31:04.250
Betty. Henry.

31:04.410 --> 31:06.960
So i totally sucked at tutoring yesterday.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.020
I referred to nine as a prime number.

31:09.170 --> 31:11.920
Can you imagine? Nine--Only divisible by one and itself?

31:12.070 --> 31:14.380
I completely forgot about three. Oh,no.

31:14.550 --> 31:17.430
I know, but i am not giving up.

31:17.590 --> 31:18.620
I stayed up all night,

31:18.800 --> 31:21.240
And i came up with some awesome new stuff. You did?

31:21.400 --> 31:22.760
I'm gonna dress up like pythagoras

31:22.920 --> 31:24.720
And teach him the pythagorean theorem.

31:24.880 --> 31:29.610
That's so sweet. Thank you,um,for caring.

31:29.770 --> 31:32.850
Oh,well,a boy needs his... algebra.

31:33.020 --> 31:34.250
Okay.

31:35.030 --> 31:37.240
Catch you later,calculator.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.990
Bye.

31:45.590 --> 31:47.090
Excuse me.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.060
Hi. Can i help you?

31:49.230 --> 31:51.180
You must be betty suarez.

31:51.350 --> 31:52.380
Uh-Huh.

31:52.540 --> 31:55.430
I hear we have a lot in common.

32:02.890 --> 32:06.970
First i was victimized by a grizzly and now you.

32:07.130 --> 32:10.230
I'm not sure which is worse. Ms. Worthington, i can explain.

32:10.410 --> 32:12.970
Please explain why i got a call from my agent

32:13.120 --> 32:15.320
Telling me the story i submitted to "mode"

32:15.480 --> 32:17.830
Ended up at "the new york review" with your name on it.

32:17.980 --> 32:20.460
Well, i didn't mean for it to--

32:20.620 --> 32:22.530
We'd be happy to.

32:22.690 --> 32:26.870
Hi. Daniel meade, editor-In-Chief. Nice to meet you.

32:27.020 --> 32:29.700
You'll be the second person i name in my lawsuit.

32:29.850 --> 32:32.780
No,daniel,ms. Worthington, this was all my mistake.

32:32.970 --> 32:35.010
It was a big,huge mistake.

32:35.190 --> 32:39.170
Actually,it was mine. See, i had two stories on my desk.

32:39.320 --> 32:42.170
I must have mixed up the covers, becausi sent the one

32:42.340 --> 32:43.080
I thought was betty's

32:43.240 --> 32:44.980
To a friend of mine at "new york review,"

32:45.140 --> 32:48.180
<I>and he flipped over the story. Your story,unfortunately.</I>

32:48.340 --> 32:50.660
That is not the unfortunate part,if you ask me.

32:50.830 --> 32:53.050
Yes,it is, because there is no way "mode"

32:53.210 --> 32:56.590
Would let anyone else publish your amazing piece.

32:56.750 --> 33:01.550
In fact,we're prepared to offer you double your fee.

33:01.970 --> 33:04.760
I'm sorry. Talk into the good ear.

33:04.930 --> 33:06.020
Did you say double?

33:06.180 --> 33:06.840
Absolutely.

33:06.990 --> 33:11.420
Well,i will think of something else for "the new york review."

33:11.570 --> 33:14.150
Next summer i'm going diving in australia.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.710
Lots of shar there.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.910
Fingers crossed.

33:19.070 --> 33:21.020
Betty,why don't you escort ms. Worthington down

33:21.190 --> 33:22.490
And get the contract signed?

33:22.650 --> 33:24.510
And when you're done, stop by my office.

33:24.660 --> 33:26.930
We he to have a little chat.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.160
(Henry) hello?

33:30.150 --> 33:31.870
Hello?

33:32.040 --> 33:33.680
Justin?

33:34.490 --> 33:35.570
I--

33:36.290 --> 33:37.640
Justin?

33:43.540 --> 33:44.980
Justin!

33:45.150 --> 33:46.830
What's your damage,yo?

33:46.990 --> 33:48.430
Are you here alone?

33:48.580 --> 33:52.210
You're supposed to be working on your algebra,not making out.

33:52.380 --> 33:54.380
And--And i'm sure you're very nice,

33:54.530 --> 33:55.860
But you really shouldn't be wearing clothes like that

33:56.010 --> 33:59.200
Until... ever.

33:59.360 --> 34:02.180
<I>and you're drinking? It's just beer.</I>

34:02.340 --> 34:05.000
<I>beer is a gateway drug.</I>

34:05.160 --> 34:06.230
Justin.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.040
Back off. You're not my dad!

34:08.179 --> 34:09.210
I...

34:18.310 --> 34:19.239
What were you thinking?

34:19.380 --> 34:21.199
????

34:21.340 --> 34:22.860
How much trouble you could've gotten into?

34:23.010 --> 34:27.429
I know! I know. It was stupid,but i...

34:27.870 --> 34:29.290
I got so nervous,

34:29.460 --> 34:30.600
And you read my story,

34:30.750 --> 34:34.020
And you gave me that fake smile and the thumbs-Up.

34:34.190 --> 34:37.270
Wait. Does everybody know about that?

34:38.210 --> 34:40.590
Look,daniel, i know you didn't like it,

34:40.760 --> 34:41.929
So i read that woman's story,

34:42.100 --> 34:44.179
But i never thought it was gonna get so out of control.

34:44.340 --> 34:47.350
You did all this becausei didn

34:47.510 --> 34:51.110
Yeah. I mean,your opinion means a lot to me.

34:51.270 --> 34:53.320
That's crazy. Why do you even care what i think?

34:53.469 --> 34:57.300
Because you're the editor of "mode,"

34:57.460 --> 35:00.040
And you're my friend.

35:00.540 --> 35:02.170
Betty...

35:05.650 --> 35:08.890
You can't put me on a pedestal. I mean,trust me,

35:09.040 --> 35:11.570
I don't deserve it. You know as well as i do,

35:11.720 --> 35:14.450
The only reason i'm in this job is because of my father.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.550
Well,that's just what everybody else says.

35:16.720 --> 35:17.710
Everybody says that?

35:17.880 --> 35:19.460
Daniel,it doesn't matter.

35:19.630 --> 35:22.600
You are good at this, and you're getting better,

35:22.760 --> 35:23.850
And...

35:24.200 --> 35:26.710
Wait. This is supposed to be my pep talk.

35:26.890 --> 35:29.490
Okay,then you should have faith in yourself.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.360
You're gonna get better,too.

35:31.540 --> 35:35.370
I mean,maybe your story... wasn't that great--

35:35.520 --> 35:37.140
Do you understand the meaning of "pep talk"?

35:37.300 --> 35:40.380
Maybe it wasn't that great, but--There is a but--

35:40.530 --> 35:42.090
It doesn't matter what i think.

35:42.420 --> 35:44.840
It doesn't matter what your professor thinks.

35:44.990 --> 35:47.470
Do you like your story?

35:48.010 --> 35:51.870
Well... the spelling was impeccable

35:52.040 --> 35:55.640
And there were some funny lines.

35:55.900 --> 35:58.870
See? I mean,there you go.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.830
It's okay to make mistakes.

36:01.030 --> 36:03.880
You just have to learn from them.

36:04.950 --> 36:06.900
I kn i do.

36:12.930 --> 36:15.400
Guest list. Studio 54.

36:15.550 --> 36:18.500
I was a good assistant.

36:19.550 --> 36:20.570
And just so you know,

36:20.610 --> 36:23.340
????

36:23.490 --> 36:25.090
Eventually.

36:25.230 --> 36:26.880
Now if that doesn't say love,

36:27.030 --> 36:30.500
I don't know what does.

36:45.730 --> 36:48.430
Hey,whoa,whoa! Hey,buddy. Uncool.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.110
It's just me.

36:50.240 --> 36:53.130
Didn't we just have the men's bathroom conversation yesterday?

36:53.290 --> 36:55.530
I just heard what happen with atlantic attire.

36:55.680 --> 36:56.720
I-I can't believe you did that.

36:56.870 --> 37:00.230
You're the best brother the world. No,i'm not.

37:00.540 --> 37:03.590
Not even close. Come on,daniel. You totally stood up for me.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.180
Lo,stop it. Why are you bein so weird about this?

37:06.330 --> 37:07.430
You took care of me.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.250
You' been taking care of me since the accident.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.480
Look,i can't do this anymore.

37:14.780 --> 37:16.760
Get out.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.110
It wasn't your fault.

37:21.280 --> 37:21.800
What?

37:21.990 --> 37:25.240
The accident. It was my fault.

37:25.590 --> 37:28.320
I thought you said i swerved to miss a deer.

37:28.490 --> 37:31.450
Yeah,i lied. I was drunk. I was spun out on pills.

37:31.610 --> 37:33.570
You were speeding to try and get me to help.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.880
As usual,i was the screwup.

37:36.040 --> 37:39.070
I'm the reason you almost died.

37:40.370 --> 37:43.260
It was my fault.

37:54.420 --> 37:57.290
It was just an accidt.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.370
Hi,daddy.

38:11.260 --> 38:14.770
Oh,and hello to you,too,pops.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.040
Mm.

38:18.510 --> 38:20.650
<I>hola,papi.</I>

38:20.890 --> 38:22.840
You were all at studio 54 that night,

38:23.000 --> 38:24.360
And i will find that tweety bird

38:24.520 --> 38:27.250
If i have to search every one of your asses.

38:27.410 --> 38:30.130
Big,big,big,big,big,big, big,big,big,big,big,big.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.590
I just talked to tommy at ralph lauren

38:31.750 --> 38:33.080
Who talked to ralph at tommy hilfiger

38:33.240 --> 38:34.320
Who slept with calvin at donna karan

38:34.480 --> 38:35.250
Who had drinks with karen at calvin klein--

38:35.410 --> 38:39.830
Point? They all know about atlantic attire pulling out.

38:39.990 --> 38:40.840
And now all those companies

38:41.000 --> 38:43.320
Are talking about pulling their advertising,too.

38:43.470 --> 38:47.600
People are saying that "mode" is in trouble.Wonder who start

38:47.750 --> 38:49.920
Oh,my god. It's happened.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.510
The botox has finally seeped into your brain.

38:52.660 --> 38:56.530
What are you doing? I took lemons and made a lemon martini.

38:56.700 --> 38:59.340
So you want to destroy "mode"?

38:59.420 --> 39:02.070
????

39:02.220 --> 39:03.680
But i don't understand. Why?

39:03.830 --> 39:05.550
Follow the bread crumbs, gretel.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.860
There's only room for one fashion magazine

39:08.020 --> 39:09.270
At meade publications,

39:09.430 --> 39:13.690
<I>but if something were to happen to "mode,"

39:13.830 --> 39:15.820
There would be room for...

39:20.420 --> 39:23.780
Holy rosie,oprah,martha!

39:23.950 --> 39:28.640
"Slater"--The fashion luxury magazine of the future.

39:28.980 --> 39:31.080
It will rise like a phoenix

39:31.230 --> 39:34.620
From the ashes of "mode."

39:49.230 --> 39:51.190
Henry,what's going on?

39:51.340 --> 39:54.220
It's justin. He's a mess,and ican't

39:54.380 --> 39:57.680
What are you talking about? Well,i got here tonight and found him kissing a girl--

39:57.840 --> 40:00.160
With tongue-- And drinking beer.

40:00.320 --> 40:04.020
Are you kidding? This is all my fault. I should have been here earlier.

40:04.180 --> 40:06.250
Henry,it's not your fault.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.290
Justin's going through some rough times.

40:08.430 --> 40:12.140
He's gonna make mistakes. That's what kids do. I didn't have a sip of beer until college,

40:12.290 --> 40:13.530
And i threw up alover the quad.

40:13.690 --> 40:15.710
In fact,i hope he's up there throwing up right now. Henry.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.630
Well,it might be good for him. Maybe he'll learn his lesson.

40:18.790 --> 40:21.810
Or not. I don't know. Tough love?

40:21.970 --> 40:24.850
Okay. Stop freaking out. This is lda's responsibility.

40:25.010 --> 40:26.660
Well,i should know what to do, and i n't.

40:26.830 --> 40:28.050
Why do you need to know what to do?

40:28.210 --> 40:31.410
Because i'm gonna be a father!

40:32.720 --> 40:34.470
Oh.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.060
So the baby's yours?

40:41.900 --> 40:44.690
Well, how long have you known?

40:45.660 --> 40:48.070
A couple days.

40:49.350 --> 40:52.000
I didn't want to tell you because...

40:52.660 --> 40:55.900
As long as you didn't know, there was still...

40:56.080 --> 40:58.070
I don't know...

40:58.220 --> 41:01.610
Some fantasy where you and i could be together.

41:06.140 --> 41:09.170
I'm sorry,betty.

41:10.150 --> 41:12.770
You should go.

41:29.300 --> 41:32.170
(Bet) sometimes we want things to be different.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.380
We think maybe if we pretend that they are,

41:34.530 --> 41:37.500
Fool people,that's enough,

41:37.640 --> 41:39.660
But it never is.

41:39.810 --> 41:42.440
I know you all loved my last story,

41:42.580 --> 41:45.230
But the truth is, it wasn't mine,

41:45.850 --> 41:47.650
And all the wonderful
things you said about it

41:47.810 --> 41:49.970
Just made me feel awful.

41:50.110 --> 41:53.110
So i'm sorry for lying.

41:53.270 --> 41:56.690
And today i want to share
with you my real story.

41:57.160 --> 41:59.910
"Queen of my own prom."

42:03.460 --> 42:06.430
By betty suarez.
