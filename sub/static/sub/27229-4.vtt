The last thing Ramona wants
is for us to meddle in her social life.

Technically, we didn't eat your tapas.

are kind of a seasonal business, so...

she posted that you were "B.A.B."

you're not the school narc

we graduated together.

You turned all these people
against Ramona

getting more popular than you are.
