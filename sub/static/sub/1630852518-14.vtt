00:27.736 --> 00:28.987


00:29.696 --> 00:31.531
-
-This is it!

00:31.614 --> 00:35.744
Today is the day I finally die…
of boredom!

00:36.244 --> 00:39.122


00:40.540 --> 00:43.168
I'm going to the carwash,
and I'll give you two dollars in quarters

00:43.251 --> 00:44.544
for the toy dispensers.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.546
If I had…

00:46.629 --> 00:48.089
<i>…three</i> dollars in quarters,

00:48.173 --> 00:51.009
it might be enough to save me.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.013
Well, it was your best
bored-to-death performance to date,

00:55.096 --> 00:56.890
so one more dollar, but that's it.

00:56.973 --> 00:59.309
Yes! Oh, and can Dukey come?

01:09.069 --> 01:11.613
Hello, Squishy Wooshies!

01:15.742 --> 01:17.869
I didn't get it.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.499
I didn't get it.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.797
Nooo!

01:32.383 --> 01:34.177
Aw, that's sad.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.971
But their disappointment is my gain,

01:37.055 --> 01:39.766
because today is the day I finally get…

01:39.849 --> 01:41.935
the rare Gnarly Narwhal,

01:42.018 --> 01:45.480
and complete
my Squishy Wooshie collection!

01:49.943 --> 01:50.985
Not a Narwhal.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.822
Not a Narwhal.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.827
Nooo!

02:00.829 --> 02:01.955
Quick, tear me.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.501
N-No.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.379
But I just need one more dollar
to get the Narwhal!

02:09.462 --> 02:11.214
It's next, I know it.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.926
Johnny, I have had it with your
waste-of-money collecting obsession.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.970
You had to get all the Roboticles,

02:17.053 --> 02:19.097
every Tinymon trading card on the planet,

02:19.180 --> 02:22.517
and I am done giving you quarters
to collect a foamy horned whale

02:22.600 --> 02:24.894
that probably doesn't exist!

02:24.978 --> 02:27.814
Wrong! Cos there's a bunch
of Gnarly Narwhals on ePal

02:27.897 --> 02:29.816
for only $50.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.443
Johnny! I will never pay $50

02:32.527 --> 02:35.071
for something that only cost
five cents to make!

02:36.656 --> 02:37.824
What did you find in the car seats?

02:37.907 --> 02:41.744
One tissue packet, two pens,
three lip balms and…

02:41.828 --> 02:43.913
four quarters!

02:43.997 --> 02:48.751
Yes! Now we just have to figure out
how to get Dad back to the carwash.

02:49.544 --> 02:53.423
We call it
the MRI-gnifying glass.

02:53.506 --> 02:57.176
It gives you the ability and portability
to see inside of things.

02:57.969 --> 02:58.887
Uh-huh.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.265
Like four-inch-thick steel safes!

03:04.601 --> 03:06.936
We're such geniuses.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.981
That's great, but I just need to borrow
some safety cones.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.232
Why?

03:15.236 --> 03:16.321
More dirt.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.575
And you think this will work?

03:20.658 --> 03:23.328
-Yes, and--

03:23.411 --> 03:24.621
Tree it now!

03:29.751 --> 03:31.544
Three… two…

03:31.628 --> 03:32.795
-a-one…

03:32.879 --> 03:35.423
My clean car!

03:43.264 --> 03:45.433
It's another zebra!

03:46.768 --> 03:48.603
The Narwhal's not in there, man!

03:48.686 --> 03:51.439
It's like a cruel game!

03:51.522 --> 03:54.943
Oh, it's there. Just watch the master.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.203
This can't be happening.

04:05.286 --> 04:08.581
Maybe your dad's right
and there is no Gnarly Narwhal.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.793
There's only one way to find out!

04:12.627 --> 04:15.922
Johnny need MRI-gnify-thing to see if
there's a Gnarly Narwhal at the carwash,

04:16.005 --> 04:18.424
and before you say no…
please, oh, please!

04:18.508 --> 04:21.261
Please, I need to know,
and… you love me.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.597
Take it.

04:24.681 --> 04:28.810
But you guys are going way too far
for a cheap foam toy.

04:28.893 --> 04:29.894
Oh, we know.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.980
And how are you gonna get
back to the carwash?

04:32.814 --> 04:34.774
Oh, yeah. Do you have any birdseed?

04:42.949 --> 04:46.369
-Now?
-Give them another moment to digest.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.872
-Now!

04:53.084 --> 04:56.629
My clean car! Again!

05:01.134 --> 05:05.722
It's not a toy dispenser,
it's a sadness machine!

05:05.805 --> 05:08.599
Well, we're about to find out.

05:13.479 --> 05:16.899
Wait, there's not a single Gnarly Narwhal
in the whole thing!

05:18.109 --> 05:19.277
Sorry, kids.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.447
I know Gnarly Narwhal
is the rarest of all Squishy Wooshies,

05:22.530 --> 05:23.865
but they do exist.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.409
I saw one on ePal for $50.

05:27.952 --> 05:31.622
Yeah, well, he knows
that ePal is not an option.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.836
Johnny, give up!

05:36.919 --> 05:38.880
It's just a foam toy.

05:38.963 --> 05:39.922
Come on!

05:40.006 --> 05:43.134
Haven't you ever wanted something so bad
you literally can't sleep?

05:43.217 --> 05:44.218
No.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.348
Yes.

05:51.726 --> 05:55.772
OK, according to the Squishy Wooshie
company's delivery log,

05:55.855 --> 05:57.648
a new shipment will arrive
at the carwash

05:57.732 --> 05:59.108
first thing in the morning.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.070
And there will be four
Gnarly Narwhals in the batch.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.073
But you'll have to get to the carwash
before it opens,

06:05.156 --> 06:07.200
and how are you gonna do that?

06:07.283 --> 06:11.162
Hmm… Can you hack
construction businesses too?

06:16.417 --> 06:19.504
OK. It says to dump it right here.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.764
How does this keep happening?

06:31.682 --> 06:34.644
Perfect! We're the first ones here, and…

06:42.026 --> 06:44.487
He took all the Gnarly Narwhals!

06:44.570 --> 06:46.656
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:47.323 --> 06:49.742
For sale by… Carl Wash?

06:50.493 --> 06:53.287
He's the one selling them online
for 50 bucks!

06:54.831 --> 06:58.543
Save your quarters, everyone.
We've all been had.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.088
What do you mean,
you've all been had?

07:02.171 --> 07:06.759
Yeah, your kid must be seeing things,
cos I didn't do it.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.345
Yeah, my kid doesn't "see things."

07:09.428 --> 07:11.597
He's actually terrifyingly smart,

07:11.681 --> 07:14.559
and you don't even wanna know
about his sisters.

07:14.642 --> 07:18.312
Yeah, well, I don't have
any Squishy Narwhals in my pocket.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.522
See?

07:19.605 --> 07:22.984
Now… have a nice day.

07:26.779 --> 07:30.199
Who preys on innocent young kids'
collecting obsessions like that?

07:30.283 --> 07:33.119
OK, this guy needs to be taught a lesson.

07:33.202 --> 07:36.998
But that guy is huge.
It will take an army to take him down.

07:37.081 --> 07:41.461
Hey! Your father told me
some jerk ripped off my son.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.172
What do you need… from us?

07:45.131 --> 07:46.424
That's a good start.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.719
And I'll call some friends.

07:51.679 --> 07:54.765
<i> OK, first, Mom buys</i>
<i>all ten Gnarly Narwhals</i>

07:54.849 --> 07:57.560
<i>and orders rush delivery</i>
<i>from Carl Wash…</i>

07:58.478 --> 08:00.605
which you can return
and get your money back

08:00.688 --> 08:02.064
if the plan fails.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.111
Jackpot.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.156
<i> Then the mean and greedy man</i>
<i>packs them all up for shipping,</i>

08:10.239 --> 08:11.741
<i>cos he's mean and greedy…</i>

08:15.661 --> 08:17.872
The bird has left the nest.

08:17.955 --> 08:22.084
<i> Next we track his route</i>
<i>and create a little extra stop…</i>

08:25.004 --> 08:28.925
OK, he's heading to the post office
on Maple Street.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.928
Which is now a very hazardous street.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.813
Come on! I got a rush delivery!

08:44.732 --> 08:48.236
<i> And that's when his dirty trick</i>
<i>starts getting dirty.</i>

08:49.278 --> 08:52.740
It says drop it right… now!

08:56.494 --> 08:59.622
<i> Then I make the switch</i>
<i>with our mole…</i>

09:00.623 --> 09:02.792
You owe me for this, Test.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.961
Uh-huh, yeah. Now, start digging.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.969
My clean car! What do I do?

09:17.265 --> 09:21.185
<i> And lastly, a little taste</i>
<i>of the pain he caused kids.</i>

09:25.481 --> 09:28.651
-You gotta be kidding me.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.947
The birds have made a mess.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.616
Hello, and stop right there.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.035
I'm Mr. White and this is Mr. Black.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.121
We work for the government.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.627
There's been reports of mail fraud,
people selling things online,

09:46.711 --> 09:48.629
but sending them something different.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.089
Not me.

09:50.172 --> 09:54.176
I'm just sending out a bunch
of Squishy Narwhals I sold online.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.637
They're rare, and I packed them myself.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.725
Are you sure you're not…

10:00.808 --> 10:02.727
seeing things?

10:06.230 --> 10:07.607
Oh, no.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.734
Yeah, you're gonna have to come with us.

10:10.318 --> 10:14.739
No, no, come on, it was a mistake!
There's a kid…! Naah!

10:14.822 --> 10:17.533
Who wants a Gnarly Narwhal?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.910
Me, me, me! I want it! I want it!

10:22.496 --> 10:23.414
I love this!

10:26.125 --> 10:28.252
We are really good parents.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.545
And crazy.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.633
-We're good and crazy parents.
-Isn't that the best kind?

10:33.716 --> 10:37.762
Yes! My Squishy Wooshie collection
is complete.

10:38.346 --> 10:42.600
Which means we can all go home
and forget this car wash and…

10:46.103 --> 10:47.980
"Li'l Monster Racers.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.608
Collect all ten…?"

10:52.151 --> 10:53.277
Oh, no.

10:53.361 --> 10:56.697
But I need them!
They're monsters! With wheels!

10:56.781 --> 11:00.117
I need them! I need them!
