00:34.000 --> 00:37.251
They say love is our greatest weapon,

00:37.253 --> 00:39.837
that it can slay our darkest fears.

00:48.181 --> 00:50.048
Maria was growing stronger,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.716
fighting back against the limits

00:51.718 --> 00:54.519
of Abigail's control.

00:54.521 --> 00:58.606
Her will, forged by the heat of battle

00:58.608 --> 01:01.392
and the flames of desire...

01:01.394 --> 01:04.062
I wish you could see how
perfect you look right now.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.117
I like what I'm seeing.

01:09.119 --> 01:11.869
Are you sure you're ready for this?

01:11.871 --> 01:15.540
Let's find out.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.319
Spencer... Oh...

01:46.656 --> 01:48.489
Spencer?

01:50.944 --> 01:54.829
That hurt a little.

01:54.831 --> 01:56.280
Maria!

02:00.336 --> 02:02.670
I looked everywhere. I
don't know where she is.

02:09.345 --> 02:11.429
David, tell me what's going on.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.347
Grace is gone.

02:13.349 --> 02:15.766
Now Bledsoe can't find Tetra.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.521
Something's happened.

02:27.197 --> 02:31.699
It's always darkest before the light,

02:31.701 --> 02:34.652
but the opposite is just as true.

02:40.326 --> 02:45.329
The world doesn't stop spinning
once the sun finally rises.

02:47.050 --> 02:50.668
The darkness simply
waits for its next turn.

02:53.389 --> 02:58.309
And there are some places
at the end of the world

02:58.311 --> 03:03.147
where light is just a memory,

03:03.149 --> 03:07.318
and shadows rule eternal.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.380
Please, have a seat.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.557
Is my mom going to meet us here?

03:46.559 --> 03:48.893
Don't worry. You're in good hands.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.729
Someone will be here
shortly to take us to her.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.231
What'll you have?

03:53.233 --> 03:54.732
Two coffees,

03:54.734 --> 03:56.617
and the little lady will
have the soup du jour

03:56.619 --> 03:59.070
and whatever bread you got left.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.920
What is this place?

04:15.922 --> 04:19.974
Why, it's just your
average neighborhood diner.

04:19.976 --> 04:21.425
I'm not hungry.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.594
Let me give you a little life lesson, kid.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.929
Wh...

04:24.931 --> 04:27.098
- Hey!
- Never say no to a meal.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.483
I didn't mean to spill it.

04:29.485 --> 04:32.570
Please, please!

04:32.572 --> 04:35.156
Aah!

04:35.158 --> 04:37.608
You never know when it might be your last.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.661
Uhh... aah... aah!

05:38.770 --> 05:41.200
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:02.241 --> 06:05.374
- What happened?
- Only God knows.

06:07.413 --> 06:11.248
Tetra, no.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.584
- Where's her body?
- A neighbor called,

06:13.586 --> 06:15.886
a parishioner walking her dog
through the church grounds.

06:15.888 --> 06:17.755
Called me before calling the police.

06:33.105 --> 06:34.938
Am I dead?

06:34.940 --> 06:37.274
No, you're alive,

06:37.276 --> 06:39.943
but that won't last long
if you don't behave yourself

06:39.945 --> 06:42.112
and do exactly what old Monty says.

06:42.114 --> 06:43.914
Is that you?

06:45.951 --> 06:48.619
Montclair St. Claire Ã‰clair.

06:48.621 --> 06:50.838
I know what you're thinking.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.757
Three names in the South, serial killer...

06:56.796 --> 06:58.762
My parents just had a sense of humor.

07:02.101 --> 07:05.018
I'm a ferryman.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.970
Ferryman. What is that?

07:06.972 --> 07:09.640
The term's a little out
of fashion these days.

07:09.642 --> 07:13.143
Most of us drive diesel
instead of rowing a skiff,

07:13.145 --> 07:16.363
but my job hadn't changed
much over the years.

07:19.652 --> 07:23.821
And you are quite a special passenger.

07:26.492 --> 07:30.127
Don't worry... I'm gonna
deliver you to your mama.

07:33.048 --> 07:37.050
There has to be a connection
between Tetra and Grace missing.

07:37.052 --> 07:38.886
You were the last one who saw her.

07:38.888 --> 07:40.971
What did Grace say?

07:40.973 --> 07:42.139
We argued.

07:42.141 --> 07:43.340
About what?

07:44.727 --> 07:47.060
- Her being with me?
- Yes.

07:47.062 --> 07:49.229
Mar, I don't even know how
you can look at this hypocrite

07:49.231 --> 07:51.014
- after what he did last night.
- Stop it.

07:51.016 --> 07:52.850
I know I've made mistakes,

07:52.852 --> 07:54.518
but I don't have time to
beg anyone's forgiveness

07:54.520 --> 07:56.487
until we find Grace first.

07:56.489 --> 07:58.155
Tetra promised...

07:58.157 --> 08:00.657
She promised me last night
she'd protect my baby.

08:03.529 --> 08:07.414
That book, like the
ones Dad used on Sangolo.

08:07.416 --> 08:10.701
This was a ritual... a blood sacrifice.

08:10.703 --> 08:13.170
- Maybe Tetra was trying to help.
- Come on, Mar.

08:13.172 --> 08:15.339
You don't believe anything
good could come from something

08:15.341 --> 08:17.424
that evil, do you?

08:17.426 --> 08:19.543
But I do now.

08:19.545 --> 08:21.512
Look, it's this book.

08:21.514 --> 08:23.396
The sign of the angel is in it.

08:23.498 --> 08:25.048
Tetra showed me,

08:25.050 --> 08:27.518
and she said she saw it on Grace's back,

08:27.520 --> 08:28.886
said she's our only hope.

08:30.606 --> 08:32.272
So I have to believe it.

08:42.201 --> 08:43.232
I have to believe it.

08:43.235 --> 08:44.902
Elijah.

08:44.904 --> 08:46.069
Bledsoe!

08:47.206 --> 08:49.239
I have to believe it.

08:49.241 --> 08:51.909
I have to believe it. I have to believe it.

08:51.911 --> 08:53.410
- Are you okay?
- Have to believe it,

08:53.412 --> 08:55.412
I have to believe it, I have to believe it.

08:55.414 --> 08:56.880
What's happening?

08:56.882 --> 08:58.415
Believe this, Elijah.

08:58.417 --> 09:01.051
Your little girl is going to suffer.

09:01.053 --> 09:02.803
You okay?

09:02.805 --> 09:04.137
Her soul is going to rot in Hell

09:04.139 --> 09:05.923
for what you did to me,

09:05.925 --> 09:09.092
and it's all... your... fault.

09:09.094 --> 09:11.061
Bledsoe. Bledsoe, snap out of it.

09:11.063 --> 09:12.396
Bledsoe!

09:15.768 --> 09:17.985
What just happened?

09:17.987 --> 09:20.654
That book.

09:24.827 --> 09:27.110
It's in some ancient language.

09:34.086 --> 09:35.285
What is that?

09:42.795 --> 09:44.628
That tree.

09:50.970 --> 09:52.970
David, this map.

09:52.972 --> 09:55.806
Looks like some kind of chapel.

09:55.808 --> 09:59.476
It's the same spot where
Dad built our old house.

09:59.478 --> 10:02.446
Tree is between... the house,

10:02.448 --> 10:05.482
so what's here?

10:06.952 --> 10:09.152
The shed.

10:14.376 --> 10:15.792
Oh, my.

10:18.497 --> 10:20.664
That mark on your back...

10:20.666 --> 10:23.300
It might as well be a
bull's-eye down here.

10:24.970 --> 10:27.337
And if they knew an angel was down here,

10:27.339 --> 10:28.672
they'd be fighting over which one

10:28.674 --> 10:30.724
gets to cut out your heart.

10:33.512 --> 10:38.732
Don't worry... I'll keep you
safe 'til our ride gets here.

10:38.734 --> 10:41.852
'Til then, just keep your head down.

10:45.024 --> 10:47.240
What do you want? What do you want?

10:47.242 --> 10:50.027
What do you want? What do you want?

10:50.029 --> 10:52.412
What do you want? What do you want?

10:52.414 --> 10:54.364
What do you want? What do you want?

11:10.215 --> 11:11.682
Something wrong?

11:14.553 --> 11:16.887
Life not working out the way you hoped?

11:16.889 --> 11:19.723
Is eternity not looking any better?

11:19.725 --> 11:22.392
Don't let anyone else decide your fate.

11:22.394 --> 11:24.194
Take life back.

11:24.196 --> 11:28.031
Take life now and let me show you how.

11:33.122 --> 11:36.206
You look nervous.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.408
Is this Hell?

11:38.410 --> 11:41.378
Think of this place as a holding room...

11:41.380 --> 11:43.880
everyone waiting to hear their fate.

11:43.882 --> 11:46.967
No one know which way's
up, which way's down.

11:46.969 --> 11:49.302
Only God and the Devil know that,

11:49.304 --> 11:50.754
but they're so caught up
in their own quarreling,

11:50.756 --> 11:53.724
they forgot about all these people.

11:53.726 --> 11:57.761
Some of these people been
waiting here a long, long time.

11:57.763 --> 11:59.596
Ooh!

11:59.598 --> 12:01.648
And on that note, Old Monty must say hello

12:01.650 --> 12:04.484
to his beautiful, sweet bride.

12:04.486 --> 12:05.769
Be back.

12:07.322 --> 12:09.489
I killed her on our wedding night.

12:11.076 --> 12:13.443
Just joking,

12:13.445 --> 12:15.779
but it was a tragic accident.

12:23.088 --> 12:25.672
- There's my beautiful bride.
- Monty.

12:25.674 --> 12:27.290
Oh, look at you.

12:27.292 --> 12:29.459
Oh, my Lordy, my goodness.

12:31.130 --> 12:33.964
If you want to make it out
of here alive, listen close.

12:33.966 --> 12:35.966
That man you're with...

12:35.968 --> 12:37.851
- Look at that!
- Works for Enos.

12:37.853 --> 12:39.970
A bus is pulling in soon
to take all the damned souls

12:39.972 --> 12:41.772
from this place down to Hell,

12:41.774 --> 12:44.941
and unless you do exactly
as I say, that ferryman's

12:44.943 --> 12:47.144
- gonna make sure you're onboard.
- Who are you?

12:47.146 --> 12:50.530
There's a loading dock behind
the diner through the back exit.

12:50.532 --> 12:52.983
Someone will meet you there
who can get you out of here.

12:52.985 --> 12:54.701
How do I know I can trust you?

12:54.703 --> 12:56.036
Tetra sent me.

12:56.038 --> 12:57.871
- Where is she?
- Just hurry.

12:57.873 --> 12:59.873
You don't have much time.

13:15.517 --> 13:18.034
The book and its maps were ancient,

13:18.236 --> 13:21.255
yellowed by centuries.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.257
When our father chose this plot of dirt

13:24.259 --> 13:26.877
to build our home, did he already know

13:26.879 --> 13:30.046
the evil secrets that lay buried beneath?

13:32.718 --> 13:34.551
Son of a bitch...

13:34.553 --> 13:37.854
Keeps finding ways to bring me back here.

13:37.856 --> 13:41.441
Think he wants to make me his
little girl all over again.

13:41.443 --> 13:44.361
Or was it only after that the darkness

13:44.363 --> 13:46.396
began to infect him

13:46.398 --> 13:50.734
like a poison seeping up
from the foul depths below?

14:13.225 --> 14:15.642
There's our ride, sweetheart.

14:15.644 --> 14:18.762
All right, everybody... line up, line up!

14:18.764 --> 14:21.932
Don't even think about it, cupcake.

14:21.934 --> 14:24.935
Monty, I think our friend here
was about to dine and dash.

14:24.937 --> 14:26.903
What a rude little girl.

14:26.905 --> 14:29.739
I warned you what'd
happen you didn't listen.

14:29.741 --> 14:32.742
You all enjoy your last meal?

14:34.446 --> 14:35.946
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

14:35.948 --> 14:37.580
What do you want?

14:37.582 --> 14:40.083
- What do you want?
- Time's awastin'.

14:40.085 --> 14:43.837
- Tick, tock, tick, tock.
- The mouse ran up the clock.

14:45.257 --> 14:46.756
What do you want? What do you want?

14:46.758 --> 14:49.125
Everybody on the bus.

14:49.127 --> 14:50.794
Hey!

15:06.361 --> 15:08.194
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

15:10.115 --> 15:13.533
Nowhere to run, little darlin'.

15:13.535 --> 15:17.037
â™ª I don't want to choose â™ª

15:17.039 --> 15:20.657
â™ª I want you all for me â™ª

15:22.661 --> 15:27.297
â™ª But this world don't make sense â™ª

15:27.299 --> 15:29.883
â™ª It's never easy â™ª

15:31.970 --> 15:35.338
â™ª Someday I'll come for you â™ª

15:37.476 --> 15:40.226
Shh! Quiet, quiet... It's all right.

15:40.228 --> 15:42.479
It's all right. Tetra told me about you.

15:42.481 --> 15:44.180
I'm a friend.

15:48.070 --> 15:50.820
Sometimes it's hard to tell our friends

15:50.822 --> 15:54.524
from our enemies...

15:54.526 --> 15:56.860
or which is the more dangerous.

15:59.531 --> 16:05.168
David! Davey, you son of a bitch.

16:05.170 --> 16:07.037
This is your last chance.

16:11.426 --> 16:13.676
Open this door!

16:13.678 --> 16:14.878
Nobody's home.

16:16.882 --> 16:18.214
Well, where is he?

16:20.385 --> 16:22.435
You feeling all right, Charlotte?

16:24.056 --> 16:26.356
Sheriff get you home safe the other night?

16:26.358 --> 16:29.559
Don't worry about me. I
can take care of myself.

16:29.561 --> 16:31.027
Where's David?

16:31.029 --> 16:33.613
I don't know. Something happened.

16:33.615 --> 16:36.950
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, David's fine.

16:36.952 --> 16:39.119
I meant something happened with
that girl, the rev's daughter.

16:39.121 --> 16:40.904
They're out looking for her.

16:40.906 --> 16:43.573
What the hell does he see
in that little church mouse?

16:43.575 --> 16:45.408
I know it's none of my business,

16:45.410 --> 16:49.546
but you ever think maybe
David's doing you a favor?

16:49.548 --> 16:51.214
I'm sorry if I'm outta line,

16:51.216 --> 16:54.968
but you're smart, and you're beautiful.

16:54.970 --> 16:58.088
David's a good guy,
but he has problems too.

17:00.058 --> 17:01.424
I never did thank you

17:01.426 --> 17:02.926
for giving me a ride home the other night.

17:02.928 --> 17:04.144
It was no trouble.

17:06.431 --> 17:09.065
Maybe you're right about David.

17:09.067 --> 17:10.983
I suppose I should probably be with someone

17:10.986 --> 17:13.903
a little more responsible.

17:18.242 --> 17:21.444
Any guy would be lucky to have you,

17:21.445 --> 17:25.415
but my heart's taken already.

17:25.416 --> 17:28.417
There's a lot about
Maria that you don't know.

17:30.839 --> 17:32.789
All I know is how I feel.

17:32.791 --> 17:34.257
Whatever.

17:37.345 --> 17:38.678
Look maybe you shouldn't drive.

17:46.138 --> 17:48.638
What the hell is in here?

17:48.640 --> 17:51.307
I snuck in here once when we were kids.

17:51.309 --> 17:53.977
I remember. Dad almost killed you.

17:53.979 --> 17:57.280
I just wanted to see what
he was working on so hard.

17:57.282 --> 18:00.116
He used to spend all
night in here sometimes.

18:00.118 --> 18:02.202
Right before things got bad.

18:19.171 --> 18:20.887
Something's there.

18:20.889 --> 18:22.172
Where?

18:22.174 --> 18:23.389
Here.

18:23.391 --> 18:25.675
Here, help me.

18:41.526 --> 18:42.825
It's locked.

18:46.581 --> 18:48.414
I need some air.

18:59.211 --> 19:02.595
Abigail, does that door
lead where I think it leads?

19:02.597 --> 19:04.047
You bet.

19:04.049 --> 19:06.216
Only angels and demons
can pass back out again,

19:06.218 --> 19:08.685
and if that preacher's little
brat went through there,

19:08.687 --> 19:10.220
then you need to forget about her.

19:10.222 --> 19:12.772
- I can't do that.
- I can't go down there.

19:12.774 --> 19:14.891
I'm a traitor to my kind, remember?

19:14.893 --> 19:17.944
I show my face down there,
every demon will come after me,

19:17.946 --> 19:19.529
and that means your ass too.

19:19.531 --> 19:21.064
Then don't show your face

19:21.066 --> 19:22.398
if you're so afraid of what will happen.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.867
Don't be stupid, Maria.

19:24.869 --> 19:27.036
Without my help, you'll get us both killed.

19:27.038 --> 19:28.454
It's suicide.

19:28.456 --> 19:29.622
I'm not asking.

19:29.624 --> 19:31.574
I'm the one in control here,

19:31.576 --> 19:33.076
and I'm willing to take that risk.

19:43.609 --> 19:47.078
My name is Denmark Visi.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.280
Visi, I know you.

19:49.282 --> 19:51.415
I've seen your statue in Charleston.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.835
You've been dead for almost 200 years.

19:54.837 --> 19:56.287
Killed trying to run a rebellion.

19:56.289 --> 19:57.955
And I'm doing it again.

19:57.957 --> 20:00.341
Separated by a few feet of
dirt doesn't mean the dead

20:00.343 --> 20:02.259
and the living can't help each other.

20:02.261 --> 20:04.628
- Then I am dead, aren't I?
- No.

20:04.630 --> 20:08.299
No, Grace, you're not. You're in Purgatory.

20:08.301 --> 20:10.468
It's a terrible place
run by very bad people

20:10.470 --> 20:12.937
who brought you here to send you to Hell.

20:12.939 --> 20:15.356
But where's Tetra?

20:15.358 --> 20:21.112
Tetra did what she had to do to save you.

20:21.114 --> 20:22.947
She loves you.

20:27.203 --> 20:29.703
Look, we don't have a lot of time.

20:29.705 --> 20:32.156
People hope that justice will
be settled in the afterlife,

20:32.158 --> 20:34.291
but it's just as corrupt down here.

20:34.293 --> 20:37.828
And now Enos is making
a grab for both worlds,

20:37.830 --> 20:39.797
promising them life again,

20:39.799 --> 20:43.050
this time, forever, but it's a lie.

20:43.052 --> 20:45.469
- I used to believe in people.
- We got to get you out of here.

20:45.471 --> 20:49.173
Wait... tell me, is my mom really here,

20:49.175 --> 20:51.008
or is this just another one of Enos' lies?

20:51.010 --> 20:54.311
She's here,

20:54.313 --> 20:55.846
but it's too dangerous to see her.

20:55.848 --> 20:57.848
Why?

20:57.850 --> 21:02.153
Because if I take you there,
you might not make it back out.

21:16.335 --> 21:17.535
What is that?

21:20.089 --> 21:23.090
I found it in my old room.

21:23.092 --> 21:25.709
I think maybe Mom left it for me.

21:49.785 --> 21:52.453
No, you can't.

21:52.455 --> 21:55.206
Only angels and demons
can pass back through.

21:55.208 --> 21:58.075
- How do you know that?
- Abigail told me.

21:58.077 --> 22:00.961
You can't trust her, Mar.

22:00.963 --> 22:03.547
I have to. There's no other way.

22:18.097 --> 22:19.980
I promise I'll bring her back.

23:05.478 --> 23:09.363
You had 66 straight quarters
of unprecedented growth.

23:09.365 --> 23:11.031
What do you say to analysts who say

23:11.033 --> 23:12.650
you are due for a correction?

23:12.652 --> 23:14.151
Well I like to be underestimated.

23:14.153 --> 23:16.320
It motivates me.

23:16.322 --> 23:18.489
- You have nice legs.
- Thank you.

23:18.491 --> 23:20.207
Some people call you bullish.

23:20.209 --> 23:22.042
Well, I would say they're right.

23:22.044 --> 23:24.828
I'm more bullish nowthan I've ever been.

23:24.830 --> 23:28.832
So why are you so optimistic
about A&O's future?

23:28.834 --> 23:30.834
Because we are opening up new territories,

23:30.836 --> 23:33.053
and we're finding growth in all markets.

23:33.055 --> 23:36.056
We have majority interests
in liquor and tobacco,

23:36.058 --> 23:40.644
aerospace, ammunitions,
education, textbooks.

23:40.646 --> 23:42.680
We're bigger than the Koch brothers.

23:42.682 --> 23:44.064
- Have you heard of them?
- Yes, I have.

23:44.066 --> 23:45.516
Well, they're swinging dicks,

23:45.518 --> 23:47.234
but we are bigger than them now,

23:47.236 --> 23:50.187
because I believe that the sky's the limit.

23:50.189 --> 23:51.905
- You and me... should we screw?
- Are you any good?

23:51.907 --> 23:54.525
Oh, baby, I am the best.

23:56.209 --> 23:57.958
Maria.

24:02.415 --> 24:04.415
Oh, my God, Spencer.

24:04.417 --> 24:06.750
Don't say another word, not here.

24:06.752 --> 24:08.252
Outside.

24:08.254 --> 24:10.638
This place is filled with his people.

24:10.640 --> 24:14.808
If they find you here,
they'll kill us both.

24:14.810 --> 24:16.260
But you're already dead.

24:16.262 --> 24:19.563
Down here, there are
worse things than dying.

24:46.425 --> 24:48.425
This is where we wait.

24:48.427 --> 24:50.961
Enos won't be looking here.

24:50.963 --> 24:52.463
What is this place?

24:52.465 --> 24:54.265
A weigh station.

24:54.267 --> 24:56.600
It used to be the only road
from Purgatory down to Hell

24:56.602 --> 24:58.852
'til so many souls started passing through,

24:58.854 --> 25:00.604
they had to shut this place down.

25:00.606 --> 25:03.941
They had to build a bigger
checkpoint off the highway,

25:03.943 --> 25:05.526
but we fought back.

25:05.528 --> 25:08.195
We opened this gate up in
secret, and now we use it

25:08.197 --> 25:10.864
to smuggle the unfairly
condemned back out from Hell.

25:13.486 --> 25:15.786
As soon as our man Kedon
gets here, he'll lead you back

25:15.788 --> 25:18.656
up to the surface, where you belong.

25:18.658 --> 25:20.624
I can't, not yet.

25:20.626 --> 25:22.876
- What are you talking about?
- Not without my mother.

25:22.878 --> 25:26.163
- There's no time, Grace.
- You have to take me to her.

25:26.165 --> 25:27.965
Do you understand if Enos gets
his hands on you, it's over?

25:27.967 --> 25:29.383
I came all this way.

25:29.385 --> 25:31.502
I'm not leaving until I find her.

25:36.842 --> 25:39.110
You realize what's at stake?

25:55.606 --> 25:57.106
You shouldn't be here.

25:57.108 --> 25:58.690
We're going to take care of the girl.

25:58.692 --> 26:01.360
- Gracie.
- Yes, the angel.

26:01.362 --> 26:03.028
That's why you came, isn't it?

26:08.536 --> 26:14.289
I've spent every day thinking
about what I would say to you.

26:14.291 --> 26:17.659
Spence, if I could trade
my life for yours...

26:17.661 --> 26:19.378
I didn't know how to control...

26:19.380 --> 26:21.830
- It doesn't matter now.
- It does matter, please...

26:21.832 --> 26:23.665
What do you expect?

26:23.667 --> 26:26.802
That I forgive you for
what happened in Memphis?

26:26.804 --> 26:29.171
All that drama we experience in life,

26:29.173 --> 26:32.341
what we think is tragic, is nothing.

26:32.343 --> 26:34.309
Down here is where you
learn how high the stakes

26:34.311 --> 26:38.564
- are up there.
- Can you remember?

26:38.566 --> 26:41.733
Can you still feel my love for you?

26:41.735 --> 26:44.186
Enos is gathering an army.

26:44.188 --> 26:45.687
If he gets Grace into Hell,

26:45.689 --> 26:48.690
then any hope of stopping
him goes with her.

26:48.692 --> 26:50.909
He's been busy on our side too.

26:50.911 --> 26:53.078
Tetra told us.

26:53.080 --> 26:56.031
- She's here?
- She's gone.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.866
Gave her life so she
could warn us about Grace

26:57.868 --> 27:01.587
when her soul stopped here
on its way down to Hell.

27:01.589 --> 27:03.172
Denmark, who's running the resistance...

27:03.224 --> 27:04.606
They'll save Grace,

27:04.608 --> 27:05.724
but you shouldn't have come.

27:05.726 --> 27:07.359
It's too dangerous.

27:07.361 --> 27:08.727
If anything ever happened to you,

27:08.729 --> 27:10.779
it would be bad for our cause.

27:15.202 --> 27:17.569
Come on, I'll take you to them.

27:37.258 --> 27:39.591
David.

27:39.593 --> 27:44.763
Just can't sit here feeling useless.

27:44.765 --> 27:48.267
- I should've done something.
- I know.

27:48.269 --> 27:49.435
I want to walk back through that gate

27:49.437 --> 27:50.652
and bring them both back myself.

27:50.654 --> 27:51.987
I'm not talking about that.

27:51.989 --> 27:53.989
I'm talking about this house.

27:53.991 --> 27:55.741
Growing up here,

27:55.743 --> 27:57.609
my mom never wanted us to
know he was hurting her...

27:57.611 --> 28:00.996
Didn't want to scare us, I guess.

28:00.998 --> 28:03.415
I'd hear her crying in her
bedroom. I'd go knocking.

28:03.417 --> 28:06.251
She'd come out all smiles,
pretending it was nothing.

28:08.456 --> 28:10.789
I pretended to believe her.

28:10.791 --> 28:14.960
- You were just a kid.
- I could've protected her.

28:14.962 --> 28:18.597
David, it's her job to
protect you, her children.

28:18.599 --> 28:20.516
Just like it's my job to protect Grace.

28:23.971 --> 28:27.139
- I love her.
- I know you do.

28:27.141 --> 28:28.774
By the way she looks at you,

28:28.776 --> 28:30.025
- she loves you too.
- Then what's the problem?

28:30.027 --> 28:31.310
Who do you think you're protecting?

28:31.312 --> 28:33.979
All of you.

28:33.981 --> 28:36.815
You have no idea the
burden I've been carrying.

28:36.817 --> 28:38.817
Grace isn't a child anymore.

28:51.499 --> 28:53.499
Where's Visi?

28:53.501 --> 28:56.001
The angel said she wouldn't
leave until she saw her mother.

28:56.003 --> 28:57.469
He took her across the border?

28:57.471 --> 28:59.304
Yes.

29:06.647 --> 29:08.564
Oh, this is bad.

29:08.566 --> 29:10.649
If the other side finds out
that they've already crossed over

29:10.651 --> 29:12.484
into the first circle of Hell...

29:12.486 --> 29:14.353
I'm not taking that chance.
I'm going after them.

29:14.355 --> 29:15.687
No, Visi knows what he's doing.

29:15.689 --> 29:17.856
He won't let anything happen to her.

29:17.858 --> 29:21.660
Our side can't risk
losing the angel and you.

29:21.662 --> 29:23.862
I'm not a chess piece.

29:23.864 --> 29:26.248
Listen to me, when a soul
gets killed down here,

29:26.250 --> 29:28.333
it's gone forever.

29:28.335 --> 29:30.536
Grace is my friend.

29:30.538 --> 29:32.421
I'm not leaving her behind.

29:44.552 --> 29:46.552
Last chance, you sure you want to do this?

29:46.554 --> 29:48.387
Yes.

30:03.571 --> 30:06.071
Stay close.

30:06.073 --> 30:08.073
Where are we?

30:08.075 --> 30:10.459
This used to be part of Purgatory

30:10.461 --> 30:13.128
before the redistricting.

30:13.130 --> 30:16.632
Now it's the first stop in Hell.

30:29.096 --> 30:30.646
She took her own life.

30:30.648 --> 30:33.565
Now this is her eternity.

30:33.567 --> 30:36.235
Gracie?

30:36.237 --> 30:39.154
My little girl, is that you?

30:41.275 --> 30:42.574
Please.

30:45.446 --> 30:49.248
Gracie, don't judge me.

30:49.250 --> 30:53.085
I always meant to come back for you.

30:53.087 --> 30:55.170
All these things that are happening to me,

30:55.172 --> 30:58.624
the visions, the mark
on my back... who am I?

30:58.626 --> 31:03.795
You're an angel, just like I was once.

31:03.797 --> 31:07.599
What is an angel doing
in a place like this?

31:07.601 --> 31:12.354
I was seduced by a man, a mortal,

31:12.356 --> 31:18.443
and I sacrificed everything
I was just to be with him.

31:18.445 --> 31:20.028
Dad did this to you?

31:20.030 --> 31:24.366
No, your father was a
brilliant and courageous man,

31:24.368 --> 31:28.453
but when I met Elijah,

31:28.455 --> 31:31.990
I was already married to another man.

31:38.882 --> 31:40.716
Gracie.

31:47.675 --> 31:51.176
Mom?

31:51.178 --> 31:52.844
Mommy's okay.

31:52.846 --> 31:54.846
Mommy's okay.

31:59.430 --> 32:01.214
Mommy's okay.

32:01.216 --> 32:03.049
Spencer, help me cut her down.

32:03.051 --> 32:08.004
- You can't, Maria.
- It's my eternal punishment.

32:08.005 --> 32:09.905
David said you died in a car accident.

32:14.563 --> 32:17.614
Why didn't you say anything?
I mean, I could've...

32:17.616 --> 32:19.449
You were too young,

32:19.451 --> 32:22.869
and I couldn't stand to
live with Enos in that place

32:22.871 --> 32:27.525
any longer. The Order of Everlasting.

32:28.627 --> 32:31.077
So I ran away.

32:31.079 --> 32:33.413
God, forgive me.

32:33.415 --> 32:36.749
I just ran away.

32:38.253 --> 32:41.421
I wanted a new life, a new name.

32:42.924 --> 32:44.257
Claire.

32:53.452 --> 32:55.402
Claire, I'm so sorry.

32:55.404 --> 32:56.736
You say something?

33:00.375 --> 33:02.075
You started drinking again?

33:12.637 --> 33:14.220
I never stopped.

33:14.222 --> 33:16.806
I just got better at hiding things.

33:25.901 --> 33:28.435
I should never have left you and David.

33:31.656 --> 33:35.492
But I was desperate, and Enos
would've killed all three of us

33:35.494 --> 33:38.611
if he ever caught me leaving with you.

33:38.613 --> 33:44.451
I tried to come back for you

33:44.453 --> 33:46.336
after Grace was born,

33:46.338 --> 33:52.125
but Enos caught me before I could see you

33:53.345 --> 33:56.296
and then...

33:56.298 --> 33:59.432
after what he did...

33:59.434 --> 34:03.019
Taking my own life was
the only way to stop it.

34:03.021 --> 34:04.938
To stop what?

34:04.940 --> 34:08.975
You weren't the first woman
Enos chose as host for a demon.

34:08.976 --> 34:10.810
No.

34:10.812 --> 34:13.813
I never had the strength you do.

34:13.815 --> 34:15.648
I never learned to control it.

34:17.619 --> 34:21.987
Even now, it's still inside me.

34:21.989 --> 34:25.375
Oh, please. Go away now.

34:25.377 --> 34:29.712
Oh, God, it's happening again!

34:29.714 --> 34:31.130
I can't control it!

34:31.132 --> 34:32.331
You have to try.

34:32.333 --> 34:33.882
It's the only way.

34:33.885 --> 34:35.635
You three are the only
ones who can stop him.

34:35.637 --> 34:38.972
- The Trinity... blood of my blood!
- We can't stay here.

34:38.974 --> 34:41.141
Please, Mom, I can't lose you again.

34:41.143 --> 34:43.059
Maria, it's time.

34:43.061 --> 34:44.643
Maria!

34:44.646 --> 34:46.513
Poor babies, do you miss your mommy?

34:48.315 --> 34:50.350
Don't worry, she'll never
leave you ever again.

34:50.351 --> 34:52.318
Look out! Maria!

34:52.320 --> 34:56.688
â™ª I want you all for me, it's never easy â™ª

34:56.690 --> 35:00.160
Remember, I used to sing that to my babies,

35:00.162 --> 35:02.028
to both of you.

35:02.030 --> 35:04.080
Come give mommy a kiss,

35:04.082 --> 35:06.699
just like the one you
gave your brother, David.

35:06.701 --> 35:09.169
No, no!

35:09.171 --> 35:11.504
There you are!

35:11.506 --> 35:13.840
- We're out of time.
- Let's go!

35:13.842 --> 35:15.425
I'll find a way to get you out of here.

35:15.427 --> 35:16.709
I promise.

35:20.715 --> 35:22.549
We'll get the girl.

35:29.274 --> 35:31.357
- Gracie, go!
- We have to move.

35:31.359 --> 35:32.725
Enos already knows you're here!

35:32.727 --> 35:34.444
You got to get to the checkpoint!

35:34.446 --> 35:36.396
- He did that to my mom.
- They'll be here any minute.

35:36.398 --> 35:37.530
I won't let them hurt you.

35:37.532 --> 35:39.365
Come on.

35:44.873 --> 35:46.956
Madison, Joel!

35:48.960 --> 35:50.627
Oh, my God.

35:53.248 --> 35:54.747
They got here first.

35:54.749 --> 35:56.583
Abigail!

36:01.306 --> 36:02.839
They know she's here.

36:02.841 --> 36:04.591
Then all of Hell will be after you.

36:04.593 --> 36:06.309
Take Grace. I'll hold them off.

36:06.311 --> 36:07.560
You can't. There's too many.

36:07.562 --> 36:09.812
Follow me.

36:19.241 --> 36:21.608
Enos is installing his own
gateways up to the living world

36:21.610 --> 36:23.243
for his demons to slip through.

36:23.245 --> 36:24.944
We've destroyed every one we could find.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.334
But here's one door that can only be broken

36:31.336 --> 36:32.952
from the other side!

36:55.810 --> 36:57.110
It's right here!

37:01.783 --> 37:03.316
After you make it through,

37:03.318 --> 37:04.701
you need to destroy the
door on the other side.

37:04.703 --> 37:07.203
Come with us.

37:09.457 --> 37:11.457
- I'm sorry, Maria.
- No, please.

37:11.459 --> 37:13.159
This is as far as the dead can go.

37:13.161 --> 37:14.661
No.

37:16.631 --> 37:19.332
Forgive me for what I did to you.

37:19.334 --> 37:21.334
I knew about Abigail.

37:21.336 --> 37:24.971
I went in eyes open, and
I don't regret any of it.

37:24.973 --> 37:27.724
I miss you so much.

37:29.894 --> 37:31.844
I love you.

37:31.846 --> 37:36.149
I love you, always.

37:36.151 --> 37:38.851
Maria, it's time to let go now.

37:38.853 --> 37:41.738
Believe me, you're so much
stronger than you think.

37:54.419 --> 37:55.585
You gotta go!

37:55.587 --> 37:58.588
You gotta go! Go now, go!

37:58.590 --> 37:59.872
Come on!

38:12.721 --> 38:16.055
David! David!

38:22.397 --> 38:24.280
- Grace.
- David! The door...

38:24.282 --> 38:26.733
Help me, help me.

38:26.735 --> 38:28.901
It won't hold!

38:28.903 --> 38:31.037
Oh. Oh.

38:31.039 --> 38:32.238
Take her outside!

38:32.240 --> 38:33.740
- What are you gonna do?
- Just trust me!

38:33.742 --> 38:36.125
Okay.

38:36.127 --> 38:38.745
Bledsoe, you stay, you son of a bitch.

38:46.087 --> 38:48.254
- I really thought I lost you.
- David.

38:48.256 --> 38:50.890
What?

38:50.892 --> 38:52.725
What's wrong?

39:00.602 --> 39:02.268
There's something you need to know.

39:08.576 --> 39:10.159
Why didn't you tell me?

39:10.161 --> 39:13.946
- You saw Claire.
- Her name is Deanna.

39:13.948 --> 39:16.783
My mother!

39:16.785 --> 39:18.418
Would you have ever trusted me

39:18.420 --> 39:20.286
if you knew I was the reason
she left you and David?

39:20.288 --> 39:22.955
Yes, but you chose to lie.

39:22.957 --> 39:24.791
She tried to come back for us.

39:28.596 --> 39:30.463
And maybe if I'd gone with
her, she's still be alive,

39:30.465 --> 39:33.132
but I had our baby girl to worry about.

39:33.134 --> 39:35.301
So I let her go back to that place alone.

39:35.303 --> 39:38.271
I blame myself every day for
what happened to your mother.

39:40.942 --> 39:42.809
You want me to forgive you?

39:47.315 --> 39:48.648
Get the hell out.

40:20.482 --> 40:22.315
Where's David?

40:31.159 --> 40:34.327
Love is our greatest weapon.

40:34.329 --> 40:39.916
A loaded gun pointed
straight at our hearts.

40:45.373 --> 40:48.541
Things not working out the way you planned?

40:48.543 --> 40:50.593
You tired of letting everybody down?

40:50.595 --> 40:54.096
You feel like the whole
world has turned against you?

41:16.704 --> 41:20.039
Then this message, Davey, is...

41:20.041 --> 41:21.407
Just for you.
