WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.200
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:07.280 --> 00:10.160
<i>What a tense atmosphere, right?</i>

00:10.600 --> 00:12.600
My own sister

00:12.680 --> 00:14.800
didn't give a shit about my feelings.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.040
She's probably thinking
that I mislead her.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.920
Recently, you changed.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.600
There's no guarantee
that you'll be on top again.

00:22.240 --> 00:26.080
<i>Let's see if this new player</i>
<i>can help to clear the air a little bit.</i>

00:39.760 --> 00:42.360
Now that I'm in, I'll win no matter what.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.720
I could easily live here.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.440
The tiger, little animal...

00:51.960 --> 00:53.840
This probably gets very dusty.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.000
I'm a bit dramatic.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.480
You can see it in my eyes.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.840
My name is Rafael,
I'm 37, and I'm from Rio de Janeiro.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.440
My mom calls me Rafael,
but my sisters call me Rafinha, Rafa,

01:08.520 --> 01:10.360
but I'd rather be called Raf.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.240
I don't like lies. I can't stand them.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.600
Only if it's really necessary,
if there's something at stake,

01:17.680 --> 01:18.640
like money.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.080
Then it's fine.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.840
In that case, I would lie a bit.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.320
I have a lot of charisma,

01:27.400 --> 01:29.480
but I know someone that has even more.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.160
That's why, on <i>The Circle,</i>

01:32.720 --> 01:34.720
I'm Ana Paula, my best friend.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.400
Ana's writer, I think she's 36-years-old.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.880
But since I'm lying,
I'll say that she's 35.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.240
On the past ten years,
she has been the closest friend I have.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.160
There are things I don't know about her.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.440
I might not know what her bra size is.
But I can just say...

01:52.360 --> 01:53.200
large.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.920
I want to make friends for life
on <i>The Circle,</i>

01:59.000 --> 02:02.080
I want to experience things,
feel that vibe--

02:03.600 --> 02:04.520
I want the money.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.000
Look...

02:11.360 --> 02:14.200
I don't drink often,
but if I don't drink now,

02:14.280 --> 02:18.000
my friend Ana is going to be
very disappointed on me.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.080
It's going down smoothly.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.160
No, it's not.

02:25.760 --> 02:26.880
WELCOME TO <i>THE CIRCLE</i>

02:28.040 --> 02:29.320
"Welcome to <i>The Circle."</i>

02:29.880 --> 02:30.840
Thank you.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.240
"Set your profile."

02:33.320 --> 02:34.800
So it begins.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.040
Circle, open photo gallery.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.840
Well, obviously Ana is fat,

02:43.920 --> 02:48.120
and I won't hide that
because she's proud of it.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.680
A boob pic is beautiful,

02:50.760 --> 02:54.280
but it can shock people from the start.
It's best to ease into it.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.160
Circle, open the BadGurl folder.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.640
The drink in her boobs is great.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.800
Nope. It's a plastic cup.
That's the only reason.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.600
Can you imagine
if there's someone pro-recycling

03:09.680 --> 03:11.800
and they see that picture? You're out.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.120
Circle, open the Swimwear folder.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.360
What did I tell you?

03:18.440 --> 03:21.600
Circle, let me see the picture
with the nose piercing.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.840
Sexy without looking vulgar.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.960
Which I'm not opposed to. It's a blessing.

03:27.520 --> 03:31.840
Circle, add that as my profile picture.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.560
Looking great.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.560
Age...

03:36.080 --> 03:37.400
thirty-five-years-old.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.840
Relationship status?

03:40.280 --> 03:41.400
Single.

03:41.480 --> 03:44.160
Maybe there's another single person
looking for someone.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.840
Circle, edit About Me section.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.800
Feminist and writer.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.600
Fat. In case someone don't get it.

03:51.680 --> 03:55.560
It's important to make a point here.
It's not chubby, it's fat.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.840
Single and always...

03:58.560 --> 04:01.400
#BodyPositive.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.840
I need to address my sexuality.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.000
When you meet someone on-line,
you don't go,

04:07.080 --> 04:10.360
"Do you prefer grilled or fried chicken?"

04:10.440 --> 04:12.120
No. "Do you like boys or girls?"

04:12.200 --> 04:15.280
Circle, write down, I really like men,

04:15.360 --> 04:18.240
but I also like to bat for both sides.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.320
Insert rainbow heart<i> </i>emoji.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.240
Circle, post it.

04:25.960 --> 04:29.640
I wonder if I can see
all the profiles yet.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.560
I want to see those little faces.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.120
<i>While Ana stays curious,</i>

04:35.200 --> 04:39.040
<i>one of the Lumas is exercising</i>
<i>with a piece of furniture?</i>

04:39.120 --> 04:40.080
<i>Really?</i>

04:40.160 --> 04:41.400
ALERT!

04:41.480 --> 04:45.640
"Alert!"

04:45.720 --> 04:46.840
What could it be?

04:47.280 --> 04:50.920
This alert thing it's never good news.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.600
"A new player just joined <i>The Circle."</i>

04:54.840 --> 04:57.920
I'm not the new chick
on the block anymore.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.480
<i>The Circle </i>is like the more, the merrier.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.240
It's a male or a female player?

05:03.640 --> 05:07.120
From how many women there are,
I'm guessing it's a man.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.360
Two men were blocked in a row.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.280
<i>Let's start the stalking.</i>

05:15.360 --> 05:17.520
Okay, easy there.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.440
Look, it's a woman!

05:20.520 --> 05:22.440
Ana!

05:22.520 --> 05:25.800
She's perfect! Great cleavage, sis!

05:26.240 --> 05:28.600
Circle, open Dumaresq's profile.

05:29.320 --> 05:32.080
Dumaresq is himself, he's not a catfish.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.160
That confirms it.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.560
Nobody says,
"I'll be a catfish in the game."

05:37.640 --> 05:39.600
"What will be your name?" "Dumaresq."

05:39.680 --> 05:41.960
Welcome to the madness!

05:42.040 --> 05:44.080
You arrived in a complicated time.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.600
Circle, open Akel's profile.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.280
"I like astrology."

05:49.360 --> 05:51.160
Doctors don't worry about

05:51.240 --> 05:54.280
if the Moon is Mercury Retrograde
Conjunct Pluto.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.840
Doctors don't worry about that stuff.

05:56.920 --> 06:00.040
Ana isn't here to play games, right?

06:00.120 --> 06:02.240
Let's see how she goes in the first game,

06:02.320 --> 06:04.600
but she seems very nice.

06:04.680 --> 06:05.880
Very positive.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.320
Circle, take Akel's face away from me.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.360
Circle, open Lorayne's profile.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.720
"Hyperactive and loves to chat."
So annoying.

06:16.480 --> 06:20.280
That picture it's not enough for me.
What are you trying to tell me?

06:20.360 --> 06:23.080
Circle, open Ana's profile.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.040
Ana!

06:24.520 --> 06:26.160
"Age: 35-years-old.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.960
Relationship status: single."

06:29.040 --> 06:32.160
Firemen don't belong
behind a desk on the computer,

06:32.240 --> 06:33.080
you hear me, JP?

06:33.440 --> 06:35.080
They belong on the streets.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.120
Rescuing stranded cats on trees.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.040
"Feminist and writer,

06:39.120 --> 06:40.520
fat, single..."

06:40.880 --> 06:43.400
"And always #BodyPositive."

06:44.680 --> 06:45.840
I loved it!

06:46.280 --> 06:48.960
Come closer, my plus size princess!

06:49.040 --> 06:50.480
"I really like men,

06:50.560 --> 06:53.280
but I also like to bat for both sides."

06:53.360 --> 06:55.360
She's incredible. So like Dumaresq.

06:55.440 --> 07:00.000
I think it would be so much better
if she said, "I'm bisexual",

07:00.080 --> 07:03.800
rather than "I also like to bat
for both sides."

07:04.160 --> 07:06.640
I didn't get it at all!

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Circle, open Ana's picture.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.600
Oh, my!

07:13.000 --> 07:14.560
I love her boobs!

07:16.160 --> 07:17.520
Open Marina's profile.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.560
She's gonna be obsessed with me.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.720
We'll get so tight...

07:22.800 --> 07:26.760
Marina. I will put a star
next to her name.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.280
I loved her.
There's something incredible about her.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.840
Let's hope she's not a catfish.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.360
Luma needs to send
an incredible welcoming message,

07:35.440 --> 07:37.440
'cause Marina... I'm thinking.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.960
She's gonna come  strong,
rolling down the red carpet.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.560
Luma is such a catfish name.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.880
Like a straight guy
pretending to be a pretty lady.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.760
"What'll be my name? Luma."

07:50.840 --> 07:52.080
Is Ana real?

07:52.880 --> 07:55.160
Why put "fat" on her profile?

07:55.240 --> 07:57.560
I don't see why that's necessary.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.920
-Like if put "thin"?
-Yes.

08:00.240 --> 08:04.240
She's not very creative with words
for a writer.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.800
Not exactly the words,
but the text structure in general.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.680
She seems so real.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.760
So real. There's no way she's a catfish.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.560
I need to hook Dumaresq first,

08:15.880 --> 08:18.560
who is gay,
'cause all gays have a fat friend.

08:18.640 --> 08:23.240
I'm not that excited
to welcome new people.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.120
I can't handle it.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.120
<i>Yes, you can, sis.</i>

08:28.200 --> 08:29.760
<i>Let's socialize.</i>

08:32.720 --> 08:35.200
"The Circle Chat is now open."

08:37.320 --> 08:38.880
Let's chat with Ana.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.560
Welcome Ana!

08:42.600 --> 08:44.440
Circle, open chat.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.160
Now I have to pretend I liked everyone.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.000
Circle, message.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.800
I have arrived!
I can't wait to meet all of you!

08:52.880 --> 08:56.080
I'm glad to see
that women are the majority here.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.200
Send.

08:57.720 --> 09:02.400
She's trying to get on the girls side
like the good feminist she is.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.280
Message!

09:04.840 --> 09:07.320
Welcome, Ana!

09:07.400 --> 09:09.760
I'm dying to read something of yours.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.000
I'm curious.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.120
What do you write about?

09:14.200 --> 09:15.280
Send.

09:17.040 --> 09:17.880
Nice, right?

09:17.960 --> 09:20.240
"I'm dying to read" is a bit much.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.720
It seems everyone is kissing her ass
at the beginning

09:23.800 --> 09:25.440
and say, "Welcome!"

09:25.520 --> 09:26.600
Circle, message.

09:26.680 --> 09:29.480
I had a blog for several years

09:29.560 --> 09:31.880
where I wrote about celebrities.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.960
Now, I write about feminism.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.400
I'm obsessed with your second picture.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.920
I can't just answer,
I need to give a compliment too.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.920
Oh, how cute!

09:44.000 --> 09:47.760
"I'm obsessed with your second picture."

09:47.840 --> 09:50.880
Sis, that Carnival picture
is really something, isn't it?

09:50.960 --> 09:52.960
I couldn't care less about that pic.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.560
Circle, message.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.400
The about me of your profile is nice.
It showed attitude and personality.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.520
Where are you from?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.760
Smiling with hearts in the eyes emoji.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.760
Send.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.080
Jeez, JP, such an ass-kisser!

10:05.160 --> 10:09.480
JP, as always, not original at all.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.920
He said the same about Luma,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.240
Ray, and everyone else.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.880
I'll hit on JP.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.320
Here. Heart for JP.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.240
Circle, message.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.440
Thank you. I'm from São Paulo,
but raised in Rio de Janeiro.

10:23.520 --> 10:27.760
"I was reading your profile
and got curious about what is 'aggro'."

10:27.840 --> 10:29.200
How can you not know that?

10:29.280 --> 10:31.920
Well, Marcel, that's a slang word.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.160
'Aggro' is annoyance.

10:34.240 --> 10:37.720
When a guy says, "No aggro",
he means, "Don't get bothered, relax."

10:37.800 --> 10:39.480
Ana, careful. He goes after women.

10:39.560 --> 10:43.200
He likes to lure women into a trap.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.040
Circle, message. Another girl from Rio.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.200
#LoveIt.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.520
Where do you live in Rio?

10:50.600 --> 10:51.480
Send.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.200
Marina, we're almost neighbors.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.800
I live in Tijuca! Exclamation point.

10:56.880 --> 10:57.920
Send.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.640
She's really my neighbor!

11:01.720 --> 11:04.920
Marina must be so happy.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.920
I loved the fact that she's from Rio.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.760
She must be thinking,
"The fat ladies from Tijuca".

11:09.840 --> 11:11.640
Circle, message.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.160
What makes you really angry?
I loved your profile.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.520
#GirlPower.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.360
"Nice to meet you. My name is Luma.
What makes you angry?"

11:22.800 --> 11:25.120
No one talks like that in real life.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.360
Luma asks great questions. I like it.

11:27.440 --> 11:32.320
What makes Luma lose her temper

11:32.680 --> 11:34.320
Just like Marina does.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.720
I'm lost right now.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.760
What makes me lose my temper?
I'll just say,

11:39.840 --> 11:43.960
Machismo, right?
I lose my temper when I see that.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.400
"Luma, without any doubt, machismo.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.080

11:49.160 --> 11:50.880
Hi-five, Ana!

11:51.160 --> 11:55.200
That hashtag is dreadful, but I'm using it
'cause it's what you people want.

Send.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.080
What is a bi-curious?

12:03.560 --> 12:05.680
Bi-curious. Looks like a bird's name.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.120
"I just saw a bi-curious flying by."

12:08.200 --> 12:10.600
Does Lorayne bat for both sides?

12:11.440 --> 12:12.720
Circle, message.

12:12.800 --> 12:17.200

also like to bat for both sides.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.760
Akel is an old man.

12:35.840 --> 12:39.800
I want to know why she's here,
if it's in order to showcase her work.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.760
No one asked me why I'm here.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.800
Circle, message. Akel, comma,

12:45.320 --> 12:48.120
someone promised
to give me a snack, so I came.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.360
What?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.640
She's so clever!

12:55.720 --> 12:59.080
Ana is manipulating you, Akel!

12:59.160 --> 13:01.800
And that's how you answer
a jerky question.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.080
You're going to say something else, right?

13:05.160 --> 13:06.400

13:11.320 --> 13:13.160

13:36.760 --> 13:39.360
"Akel has invited you to a private chat."

13:39.760 --> 13:43.040
I really need to talk to her
about what JP said

13:43.120 --> 13:45.480
regarding the talk he had with her,

13:45.560 --> 13:48.080
that he thinks I pulled back from him,

13:48.160 --> 13:50.480
that I'm sitting on the fence too much,

13:50.560 --> 13:53.040
and I'm not very straightforward.
It's his strategy.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.320
He's gonna talk about the game,
about someone...

13:56.800 --> 13:59.920
who he doesn't trust,
which is a great topic.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.960
We only talked about stuff related
to our so called "relationship",

14:04.040 --> 14:06.360
and that doesn't help our strategy.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.840
Circle, open chat with Akel.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.960
She opened. I hope this chat goes great.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.280
It's the most important chat of the game.

14:16.640 --> 14:17.920
Circle, message.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.520
Hey, baby girl, how are you?

14:20.600 --> 14:22.760
I want to ask you something.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.920
JP told me

14:25.000 --> 14:27.680
that he felt like I was pulling back
from him

14:27.760 --> 14:31.640
and I wasn't being very straightforward
regarding what I stand for... Ellipsis.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.040
Do you feel like others share
the same concern?

14:35.560 --> 14:36.800
Circle, send.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.320
On She Fights group chat,
everyone is suspicious of you.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.280
But I can't tell you that, obviously.

14:44.360 --> 14:47.280
I think he just made all this drama up

14:47.360 --> 14:49.480
in order to have a reason to block me.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.000
Circle, message.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.680
That's precisely
what I wanted to talk about.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.920
He mentioned that
in the blocking conversation.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.040
He argued that Lucas should stay,
and I argued that you should.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.160
I didn't like his reaction.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.760
He went so far as saying
that I owed him one.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.240
Thinking emoji.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.400
Send.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.040
So...

15:10.120 --> 15:13.720
JP wanted to give me the boot,

15:13.800 --> 15:17.560
arguing that Lucas should stay,
and my love saved my ass on that one.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.280
Circle, message.

15:19.560 --> 15:20.720
On his mind,

if I left the game,
you would lose a strong ally.

<i>Go big!</i>

15:59.080 --> 16:02.040
I'm even crazier about you now.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.520
You protected me when I needed the most.

when she finds out I do funny videos?

16:18.440 --> 16:20.640
She will be all over me. She'll say,

16:20.720 --> 16:22.800
"I want to marry this guy!"

16:23.160 --> 16:26.400
"#LoKel #Admiration."

16:26.480 --> 16:28.640
I trust you.
I think you're playing fairly.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.640
You might be walking on ice right now,

16:31.720 --> 16:34.440
but you'll show what you came for,
you'll do that...

16:34.800 --> 16:37.760

on the lips, gorgeous?

16:55.080 --> 16:57.920
Cutie, you did so well.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.480
I don't have to keep a secret
about what JP told me.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.080
It was about Akel and he needs to know.

17:06.160 --> 17:10.080
He really needs to do better
and evolve in certain aspects.

17:10.160 --> 17:14.040
We're talking, I like him
and I think he likes me too.

17:14.120 --> 17:17.000
And I think things are gonna be better

17:17.440 --> 17:19.040
from now on.

17:19.120 --> 17:23.840
We need allies, friends in the game,

17:34.720 --> 17:37.440

17:37.720 --> 17:40.440
The only person

17:40.520 --> 17:43.480
I'd have something in common with
would be Marina,

I bet she wants to know about everyone,

We'll see a lot of people

19:30.840 --> 19:33.920

I'm against this witch hunt on catfishes.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.360
We have the same love
for where we're from.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.920
Let's mix the North with the Northeast

23:08.000 --> 23:10.080
and make a great meal out of it.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.080
L-O-L. Send.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.680
-Dumaresq is smart.
-Do you think he knows something?

23:15.760 --> 23:17.800
I wonder if someone gave him some dough.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.880
-Ray.
-Did Ray spill the beans?

23:20.280 --> 23:23.200
-Ray.
-Ouch, Marcel!

23:23.280 --> 23:24.120
Sorry.

23:24.560 --> 23:27.360
"...and make a great meal out of it."

23:27.440 --> 23:30.280
Wonderful! I loved to eat!

23:31.000 --> 23:31.960
Circle, message.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.920
I was thinking about the people left

23:35.000 --> 23:36.880
and I felt so lonely.

23:36.960 --> 23:40.240
I believe we can help each other here.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.840
Speaking of which,

23:42.240 --> 23:47.120
what do you think
about what Marina said regarding Akel?

23:47.520 --> 23:48.440
Send.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.920
My goal here,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.320
besides having a partnership,

23:53.840 --> 23:57.280
is badmouth Akel to them,

23:57.360 --> 23:59.720
so that we can block him.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.440
Circle, message.

24:04.520 --> 24:08.120
We have to pay attention
to everything people say in this game.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.680
I was wondering about who Akel is.

24:11.080 --> 24:11.960
And...

24:12.800 --> 24:14.680
And about helping friends out.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.720
Wait. No. "I was wondering about
who Akel is..."

24:17.800 --> 24:20.160
And I believe he's playing for real.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.240
-No.
-Dirty.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.800
-And I believe he's playing.
-Are you going to say that?

24:25.880 --> 24:27.200
Everyone is playing.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.320
No. Let him decides what it means.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.160
Luma won't get her hands dirty.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.640
"...and I believe he's playing.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.360
He's the typical Mineiro,

24:36.840 --> 24:38.640
likes to do things low-key.

24:38.720 --> 24:41.880
Sis, about helping each other out,

24:41.960 --> 24:44.480
I'm here for that too."

24:44.560 --> 24:48.320
I loved the fact that I hinted
and she confirmed

24:48.720 --> 24:51.760
that she's here for the partnership.
I think that...

24:51.840 --> 24:53.400
can really benefit us.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.920
What if he knew of the group?

24:56.040 --> 24:58.640
So what?
Luma wasn't the one who created it.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.520
Circle, message.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.680
Luma!

25:03.760 --> 25:06.920
I'm so glad to hear

25:07.240 --> 25:10.320
that you are on board
with this partnership.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.280
Circle, send!

25:14.160 --> 25:17.960
It's a new ally, Marcel. Wait a minute.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.480
Luma is so friendly!

25:20.840 --> 25:22.040
Circle, message.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.040
Let me tell you something...

25:24.480 --> 25:26.920
...I only play with honesty.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.960
"I really like to make things clear.
I loved this chat."

25:32.960 --> 25:34.600
Suck it!

25:36.120 --> 25:38.760
He really seems to be...

25:39.440 --> 25:41.680
-Lucas, everyone seems--
-He's scared.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.840
He's scared to be kicked out.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.200
Everyone seems to be something here.

25:46.280 --> 25:49.160
Trust me, baby.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.840
'Cause I'm with you,

25:51.920 --> 25:53.720
and now it's us two, girl.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.480
You got to be careful.

25:55.560 --> 25:56.880
He might be playing

25:56.960 --> 25:59.920
and he might still be friends
with Lorayne and Marina.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.520
<i>Not like before.</i>

26:05.680 --> 26:08.920
<i>They don't have time</i>
<i>to think about the new player,</i>

26:09.000 --> 26:11.680
<i>'cause it's time</i>
<i>to use their mind elsewhere.</i>

26:13.480 --> 26:14.840
"Brilliant Minds."

26:15.200 --> 26:16.440
Is it a game, maybe?

26:16.520 --> 26:19.200
It's a game! "Brilliant Minds."

26:20.120 --> 26:23.640
"It's time to find out who are
the brilliant minds on <i>The Circle."</i>

26:27.400 --> 26:28.360
Oh, shit.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.440
I'm a doctor, so I have to be smart.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.720
I'm a writer, so I have to be smart.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.160
"All players..."

26:38.240 --> 26:40.000
"...are going to answer..."

26:40.080 --> 26:43.160
-"...a common knowledge quiz..."
-"...split in two teams."

26:43.240 --> 26:45.160
This is gonna be fun!

26:46.320 --> 26:50.360
"'Cause she's the new player,
Ana'll be the Pink Team captain,

26:50.440 --> 26:52.600
and pick her own team."

26:54.560 --> 26:58.600
Now I have to show
the ones closest to me: No one!

26:59.560 --> 27:01.560
"Ana, choose your first player."

27:02.280 --> 27:03.240
Hello, Ana.

27:03.960 --> 27:04.880
Luma.

27:05.280 --> 27:06.240
Marina.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.360
I have to be on the smart ones team,

27:09.440 --> 27:11.480
'cause I'm not the smartest cookie.

27:11.560 --> 27:12.960
I rather just follow along.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.680
Me! Pick me, lady!

27:16.040 --> 27:18.920
Circle, message. Marina.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.240
Send.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.560
"Marina."

27:26.240 --> 27:29.480
I know Marina won't be helpful at all
in this game,

27:29.560 --> 27:32.400
but she might be later on.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.280
"Ana, pick your second player."

27:35.360 --> 27:36.680
Is she going to choose Duma?

27:39.840 --> 27:42.800
Circle, the second player is Dumaresq.

27:43.920 --> 27:48.200
Dumaresq was called in to the Pink Team!

27:48.600 --> 27:50.920
Let's go, Aninha! Let's go, Marina!

27:51.000 --> 27:55.120
Let's make the other eat dust!

27:55.680 --> 27:57.600
"Pick your third player."

27:57.680 --> 27:59.840
I'm sure she's gonna pick
the doctor over here.

28:00.400 --> 28:05.320
I'll pick Akel as my third player.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.800
'Cause he's 30-years-old, he's a doctor...

28:07.880 --> 28:09.800
He probably studied a lot.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.720
Look at that!

28:13.880 --> 28:16.720
His brains, baby. He's a doctor.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.600
Who's going to tell her?

28:18.680 --> 28:21.160
For Christ's sake. What a mess, huh, Ana?

28:22.480 --> 28:25.160
"Ana, pick the captain for the Blue Team."

28:25.240 --> 28:26.960
I think I would choose Ray.

28:27.040 --> 28:31.120
'Cause she's not really close to anyone,
so she could do poorly.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.280
The Blue Team captain is Ray.

28:34.720 --> 28:35.680
Send.

28:38.560 --> 28:39.600
She's crazy!

28:40.360 --> 28:42.160
I'm gonna be captain!

28:42.240 --> 28:44.000
She choose me as captain

28:44.080 --> 28:45.960
and I'm going to win something.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.520
I find Ray a little slow.

28:52.920 --> 28:56.240
"The players left are in the Blue Team."

28:56.320 --> 28:58.080
Go, Blue Team!

29:00.240 --> 29:02.640
It's Blue Team, babies!

29:02.720 --> 29:05.680
Attack, Pink Team!

29:09.240 --> 29:11.440
"Go over your door

29:11.880 --> 29:16.080
and pick up the box with your uniform."

29:17.280 --> 29:19.200
Luma liked it!

29:19.680 --> 29:21.920
<i>Yay! They'll have an outfit!</i>

29:24.720 --> 29:27.680
Look like the Pink Team works.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.320
How beautiful are these clothes!

29:31.400 --> 29:34.200
<i>A plane went by</i>

29:34.280 --> 29:37.320
<i>-And written on it was</i>
<i>-That the Blue Team's gonna win</i>

29:37.400 --> 29:41.840
<i>But the plane fell down</i>

29:41.920 --> 29:44.560
<i>And the pink went up</i>

29:44.640 --> 29:47.240
<i>Nobody will hold me down! Pink!</i>

29:47.320 --> 29:49.720
<i>Everyone's ready to go to war.</i>

29:52.000 --> 29:55.240
-"The winning team..."
-"...is going to have a pizza party!"

29:55.320 --> 29:59.440
"And the losing team
will be off-line for the night."

29:59.920 --> 30:01.600
Pizza, come to daddy!

30:01.680 --> 30:03.480
I can already smell it!

30:04.920 --> 30:06.680
"In each round,

30:06.760 --> 30:12.000
the team captains are going to choose
which player

30:12.080 --> 30:13.600
is going to answer."

30:13.680 --> 30:15.280
It's going to start.

30:15.680 --> 30:16.560
I'm ready.

30:17.760 --> 30:18.920

Send.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.480
I wasn't expecting that.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.400
Luma is super ready!

30:34.480 --> 30:37.720
The doctor knows about Science, right?
For Christ's sake.

30:37.800 --> 30:41.120
I know nothing. I'm tainted there.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.960
Crippled, actually. Leave me out.

Akel is going to answer.

Send.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.920
Jeez, what am I doing with my life?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.200
Dear Lord and Virgin Mary.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.520
"How many teeth adults have?"

30:59.640 --> 31:01.000
Where are the choices?

31:01.080 --> 31:03.920
I hope Akel has all of his teeth.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.480
If he decides to count them
and some are missing--

31:06.560 --> 31:09.080
One, two, three, four...

31:11.560 --> 31:12.400
Twenty-eight?

31:12.480 --> 31:16.000
-Six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
-Eight, nine, ten...

31:30.440 --> 31:33.240
Doctor Akel! Or is it dentist?

31:33.320 --> 31:34.960
He's a doctor, isn't he?

Congrats, Dr. Akel.

Oh, my God!
I know shit about sports!

31:55.120 --> 31:58.200
And I have Dumaresq who also knows shit
about it. Oh, my God!

31:58.280 --> 31:59.600
It's going to be JP.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.720
-What if is Lorayne?
-JP is the only man.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.360
How misogynist are you?

32:05.480 --> 32:07.200
I'm gonna choose Marina.

Ronaldo used this hairstyle

32:28.680 --> 32:30.760
to play in the FIFA World Cup?"

32:30.840 --> 32:32.640
Wait. Every four years.

32:34.640 --> 32:35.480
Ten...

32:35.560 --> 32:37.600
That hairstyle was used in 1998.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.320
It was in 2014.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.160
I'm going to guess 1998.

I can't believe it!

32:57.320 --> 32:59.160
I knew it! Marina is from Méier.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.320
She paints Brazil's flag on the streets.

Can Ana pick herself?

33:10.440 --> 33:11.600
I'll put myself up there.

If Ana misses--

33:23.560 --> 33:27.800
Dude, you said you had a celebrity blog.

This is your time to shine.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.400
Damn it. I'm screwed.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.480
Hey, for years,

33:48.840 --> 33:51.200
you wrote a celebrity blog.

33:52.480 --> 33:53.560
I have no idea.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.240
If you get that wrong,

33:55.320 --> 33:59.400
you shouldn't have mention
the celebrities.

33:59.480 --> 34:02.000
I'll choose letter B. Send.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.400
Jesus, she really got it wrong.

34:30.240 --> 34:32.280
Virgin Mary.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.040
I'm like,

34:34.520 --> 34:37.680
"What kind of celebrity blog you had?"

34:37.760 --> 34:39.160
Just for the record,

34:39.240 --> 34:41.320
my Ana wouldn't know either.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.920
So, at least, I'm into character.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.040
It reflected poorly...

34:48.160 --> 34:49.320
on you.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.960
"Topic: Geography."

34:52.320 --> 34:53.960
You should have picked me now.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.520
It's up to you, Lorayne.

34:55.880 --> 34:56.760
Send.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.600
Help.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.880
I wonder how good Lorayne is

35:02.960 --> 35:04.480
in Geography.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.280
She probably went to prep school.

35:06.360 --> 35:09.080
Go, Lorayne!

35:09.960 --> 35:12.240
<i>Looking down on your friends happiness?</i>

35:12.320 --> 35:14.600
The player who's going to answer

35:15.280 --> 35:16.200
is Dumaresq.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.440
The only one left,
so he'll have to answer.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.960
I studied Geography in one semester
in college!

35:25.000 --> 35:27.600
"What state capital

35:27.680 --> 35:29.680
the following emojis represent?"

35:29.760 --> 35:32.200
Race, finishing line, trophy.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.480
What the hell is that? A hidden message?

35:34.560 --> 35:35.880
If you put together...

35:35.960 --> 35:39.000
-race, flag, trophy--
-Man from--

35:39.080 --> 35:40.400
I know he's in my team,

35:40.480 --> 35:43.240
but I want him to get it wrong
so I'm not alone.

35:43.320 --> 35:46.200
He's running, arriving somewhere
and getting the trophy.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.480
Is it Brasília?

35:47.560 --> 35:49.680
-Rio de Janeiro?
-Conquista?

35:50.480 --> 35:52.200
The Federal District!

35:52.280 --> 35:54.240
Is there a city called Vitória?

35:54.320 --> 35:56.120
-Vitória!
-Vitória, man!

35:56.200 --> 35:58.480
Vitória!

35:58.560 --> 35:59.840
I'm gonna guess Vitória.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.600
Please, get it right, Lorayne!

36:01.680 --> 36:06.160
The answer, Circle.
Write the following message: Vitória!

36:08.040 --> 36:09.760
Yes!

36:09.840 --> 36:11.880
I knew it!

36:11.960 --> 36:13.480
Jeez!

36:13.840 --> 36:15.520
I'm the only one who got it wrong.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.000
That was close!

36:17.080 --> 36:18.080
Virgin Mary!

36:18.480 --> 36:20.040
Go, Blue Team!

36:24.680 --> 36:26.960
"It's a tie between the two teams,

36:27.040 --> 36:31.360
so the captains need to choose a player
to answer the last question."

36:31.760 --> 36:32.760
This is it.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.720
So, if we lose, it won't be my fault!

36:35.800 --> 36:37.360
Circle, message.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.560
Don't choose me. I already got it wrong.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.880
I'm gonna choose @JP...

36:42.440 --> 36:43.920
"I'm gonna choose JP.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.760
I'll give him another shot
to get it right and make us the champions.

36:48.120 --> 36:51.360
Give another shot to someone
who got it wrong? Does it makes sense?

36:51.440 --> 36:53.520
That player is Akel.

36:53.600 --> 36:54.600
Send.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.480
They choose me for the penalty.

36:58.120 --> 37:01.040
I think she overrated Akel.

37:03.120 --> 37:08.560
"What is the diameter
on <i>The Circle </i>neon sign?"

37:08.640 --> 37:12.200
The radius is half of a diameter,
so double the radius.

37:12.280 --> 37:16.080
-JP must be in his apartment like...
-...measuring with this hand.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.400
One, two...

37:18.440 --> 37:19.280
three...

37:19.360 --> 37:20.520
Circle, message.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.600
I think I'm way off,
but I guess 55 meters.

37:23.680 --> 37:24.960
Circle, send.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.240
That's too much!

37:28.320 --> 37:31.560
Look through your window, dumbass!

37:31.640 --> 37:34.440
Go, JP! I trust you!

37:34.800 --> 37:36.120
Circle, message.

37:36.200 --> 37:39.200
That was really hard,
but I'm going to guess 60 meters.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.920
#SoHelpMeGod.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.720
He said the double
of what I had estimated.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.720
62,84 METERS

37:46.800 --> 37:48.160
I wasn't that bad!

37:48.240 --> 37:50.240
I was off by only 7,84 meters.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.920
I'm a math genius!

37:52.000 --> 37:56.160
There's no way someone got closer
than I did on that one.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.400
It has to be me.

38:02.960 --> 38:03.880
BLUE TEAM

38:07.720 --> 38:11.280
Blue Team!

38:11.360 --> 38:14.080
Suck it, Pink Team!

38:15.240 --> 38:16.760
I want to die!

38:18.120 --> 38:21.080
Jeez, I never win anything in my life!

38:21.160 --> 38:23.280
Pizza!

38:23.360 --> 38:26.400
I'm going to be off-line,
I can't even say I'm sorry.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.600
<i>The face of defeat.</i>

38:34.400 --> 38:35.720
Oh, my God!

38:35.800 --> 38:38.200
A cold beer.

38:40.040 --> 38:41.160
Thanks, team!

38:41.240 --> 38:42.560
That's awesome!

38:43.320 --> 38:45.240
Come to daddy!

38:45.680 --> 38:47.760
<i>Hey, JP, can you hold me a piece?</i>

38:47.840 --> 38:50.680
All I have to say to the Pink Team is,

38:50.760 --> 38:52.320
"She Fights!"

38:53.360 --> 38:56.440
Why does it have to be
through the downs and downs?

38:56.520 --> 38:59.560
It tastes so much better after the win.

38:59.640 --> 39:03.120
<i>Happiness for ones, misery for others.</i>

39:04.040 --> 39:05.520
Are you kidding me?

39:05.600 --> 39:07.600
I'm off-line for real.

39:07.880 --> 39:11.960
I'm really sorry, Pink Team.
Cheers to you.

39:12.040 --> 39:15.120
<i>The Circle </i>likes to humiliate.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.040
Luma, pose. Let's send a picture to Ana.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.280
Send.

39:22.680 --> 39:24.360
#SuckItAna.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.600
I made my team lose on my first day.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.960
They're probably smelling my pizza.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.440
I'm over here, salivating.

39:36.360 --> 39:37.280
Cheers.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.160
Duma...

39:39.240 --> 39:41.320
-Cheers to JP.
-JP.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.160
-Beer?
-Cheers to Lorayne.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.760
To Ray, the captain.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.360
I deserve it.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.120
That's just for the privileged.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.160
<i>How about sharing that abundance?</i>

39:52.640 --> 39:54.840
"The Blue Team's chat is open."

39:54.920 --> 39:56.680
Let's chat with the girls.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.840
Circle, open Blue Team's chat.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.440
Circle, message.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.160
Blue Team for the win!

40:12.840 --> 40:16.080
I want to congratulate each
and every one of you

40:16.160 --> 40:18.360

40:18.440 --> 40:19.320

40:20.160 --> 40:21.040
You go, girl!

40:22.920 --> 40:25.200
What was that, team?

40:25.280 --> 40:27.880
JP went straight for the win!

40:28.240 --> 40:29.160
"That was crazy!

40:29.240 --> 40:31.280
Pizza, bray..." Bray?

40:31.360 --> 40:32.640
"Pizza, bree..."

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
I don't get it.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.960
I never called it beer in my life.
I call it "brew."

40:40.120 --> 40:42.120
I think she meant pizza and beer, right?

40:42.480 --> 40:45.000
Lorayne is kissing JP's ass,

40:45.600 --> 40:48.440
saying that he went straight for the win
and such...

40:48.520 --> 40:49.680
She's kissing ass.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.200
But he's onto her.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.000
I'm thinking about saying,

40:54.360 --> 40:57.720
"We were a team before,
now we're closer than ever."

40:57.800 --> 41:01.560
But then Lorayne'll know about
my alliance with the girls from the North,

41:01.640 --> 41:04.080
which is shooting myself in the foot.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.680
And Lorayne doesn't know about that.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.240
It's better to keep this way.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.880
-Lorayne is out of place.
-Yeah.

41:11.240 --> 41:12.400
Circle, message.

41:12.480 --> 41:14.720
Ray, congratulations
on your choices, captain.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.120
"#BlueWon."

41:19.760 --> 41:20.720
Xoxo.

41:21.440 --> 41:24.200
Clearly, JP didn't change

41:24.280 --> 41:27.000
with Lorayne at all.

41:27.960 --> 41:32.080
You can't ask him to act like Luma would.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.400
Not like Luma.

41:33.480 --> 41:37.360
Any person that's upset about something
wouldn't act like that.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.600
I think he needs to take sides.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.760
Or it will came across as hypocritical.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.840
He's not trustworthy.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.200
I don't have any problems with Lorayne,

41:46.280 --> 41:47.120
but...

41:47.800 --> 41:48.920
among all people here,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.440
she's the one I least relate to
strategy-wise.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.480
I think that's how he plays,

41:54.560 --> 41:56.440
pretending that nothing happened.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.440
My next ratings

41:58.520 --> 42:01.160
will reflect everything
that just happened.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.480
<i>It's not the time</i>
<i>to think about ratings, right?</i>

42:04.840 --> 42:07.200
<i>Focus on the win and have fun!</i>

42:10.200 --> 42:12.360
Oh, my God! That scared me! What was that?

42:13.360 --> 42:14.960
It's my party!

42:39.800 --> 42:40.840
Hands up.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.080
Let's go.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.520
I don't care about the party.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.560
I do. I would like to listen
to some music.

43:00.440 --> 43:01.800
#PARTY TIME

43:01.880 --> 43:03.280
I can't believe it.

43:12.520 --> 43:15.920
I thought it would be easier
to win <i>The Circle.</i>

43:16.320 --> 43:18.160
But I can even win a pizza.
