<i>The rock slide on January 15, 1905,</i>

00:46.463 --> 00:50.468
<i>surprised the villagers
while they were sound asleep.</i>

00:51.635 --> 00:56.186
<i>The rock slide occurred
in Lodalen in Nordfjord.</i>

00:56.348 --> 01:00.819
The result was a massive tsunami
that killed 63 people.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.947
<i>The wave swept across Lake Loen</i>

01:05.107 --> 01:07.576
<i>and was 40 meters high
when it hit land.</i>

01:08.569 --> 01:12.699
<i>It's been 58 years
since the Tafjord rock slide.</i>

01:12.864 --> 01:18.086
<i>40 people were killed when the side
of a mountain crashed into the fjord.</i>

01:22.749 --> 01:27.596
<i>We have registered 300 unstable
mountainsides in Norway today.</i>

01:28.171 --> 01:32.221
<i>It's only a matter of time
before the next big rock slide.</i>

01:33.510 --> 01:39.438
<i>Geiranger is now threatened by what
could be a new Tafjord disaster.</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:42.695
<i>Out along the fjord lies Åkerneset.</i>

01:42.853 --> 01:47.324
<i>A gigantic, unstable mountainside
that will fall someday.</i>

01:47.482 --> 01:51.862
Seven million cubic meters of rock
will crash into the fjord

01:52.029 --> 01:54.578
<i>creating a massive tsunami.</i>

01:55.574 --> 02:00.580
<i>Nowhere are the crevices as active
as at Åkerneset.</i>

02:00.746 --> 02:05.718
<i>The question is: Can people
in the area be warned in time?</i>

02:14.301 --> 02:20.650
THE WAVE

03:22.369 --> 03:24.918
Give me a break!
I'm 40!

04:45.243 --> 04:47.166
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.956
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.089
- What's going on?
- Mom's fixing the sink.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.171
Kristian, can you hand me a wrench?

04:58.799 --> 05:01.097
Why don't you call a plumber instead?

05:02.719 --> 05:07.145
I don't need a plumber,
but I wouldn't mind a plumber wrench.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.935
It's in there.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.319
Here, Mom.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.779
- You know what a plumber wrench is?
- Who doesn't?

05:25.534 --> 05:28.037
There. Our new place
won't have this problem.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.873
But this place has soul.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.795
- What's soul?
- Soul?

05:37.254 --> 05:40.178
Soul is some nonsense
your mother believes in.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.803
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

05:45.136 --> 05:48.515
The apartment is brand-new.
The view is amazing.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.359
The whole city is right there.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.317
And everything is run
by remote control.

05:54.479 --> 05:58.609
The lights, the music, the blinds...

05:58.775 --> 06:02.029
But what I really liked best,

06:02.195 --> 06:07.292
is that you can lock and unlock
the door with your phone.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.297
There's a key app.

06:14.749 --> 06:19.505
- And you trusted that?
- No, I had to double-check.

06:19.671 --> 06:25.053
I'd never seen a key app before
in my life. I mean, come on!

06:30.932 --> 06:33.185
Hey, what do you think?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.980
Should I throw these away?

06:37.063 --> 06:41.113
- Throw your shirts away?
- I don't know.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.324
A new place, new job...

06:45.614 --> 06:47.742
OK, you know what?

06:50.410 --> 06:54.460
I think you're going to need a suit.
It's suit and tie from now on.

06:55.749 --> 07:00.346
And you'll need a proper haircut.
This will be great.

07:00.503 --> 07:03.473
Let's forget about it
and just stay here.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.885
No, we've made up our minds.
Don't worry.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.811
Maybe I'll finally get more attention
than that mountain.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.188
You want attention?

07:15.477 --> 07:18.947
- Want me to give you some attention?
- No tickling!

07:24.402 --> 07:27.121
Hey, not on the kitchen counter!

07:29.449 --> 07:31.167
We have to make food on that!

07:42.462 --> 07:49.095
Early Warning Center
102.1 meters above sea level

08:08.989 --> 08:10.206
The six goes on the seven.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.465
Everything normal here?

08:21.918 --> 08:25.297
0.3 mm in the last 24 hours.
Within the norm.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.673
Hi.

08:27.007 --> 08:30.181
How were things
in the good old oil capital?

08:31.803 --> 08:34.272
Same old, same old.
Lots of suits.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.395
That's how capitalists always dress.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.477
How old is this?

08:40.145 --> 08:44.025
Hear that, Georg? Two days
in the city, and he's a gourmet.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.658
That's what happens.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.453
"Thanks for everything."
Sounds like a funeral.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.828
I'll let you bake next time.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.798
- Hope that won't be anytime soon.
- It looks delicious, Margot.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.506
Well...

09:06.046 --> 09:08.765
Dear Kristian, imagine that this...

09:10.467 --> 09:12.060
is your last day with us.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.141
Now you're sounding like a funeral.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.062
Unfortunately,

09:18.475 --> 09:22.946
we don't only have mountains here,
but in the North Sea too.

09:23.313 --> 09:27.693
So I understand why the oil industry
is interested in a man like you.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.451
You're truly dedicated.

09:31.946 --> 09:36.076
I speak for everyone here
when I say you'll be sorely missed.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.582
- It will be sad.
- Thank you.

09:40.330 --> 09:44.210
But it will be an incredible relief

09:44.375 --> 09:46.469
not to constantly
have to triple-check everything.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.928
- Hear, hear!
- Cheers!

09:51.341 --> 09:52.513
Cheers.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.522
- Number five, too?
- Looks like it.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.523
What's going on?

10:41.850 --> 10:44.478
The ground water suddenly sank
in four and five.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.317
Then we lost contact.

10:47.689 --> 10:48.781
Could you show me?

10:56.114 --> 10:58.367
- Bring up a camera.
- Two seconds.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.247
Zoom in.

11:07.417 --> 11:11.843
- Was there any other movement?
- No. None at all.

11:12.964 --> 11:16.264
- Could be a bad connection.
- It looks stable.

11:16.426 --> 11:20.932
We'll check the next time we're
up there. Turn off that damn alarm!

11:22.557 --> 11:24.810
Kristian?
Kristian!

11:25.852 --> 11:28.446
The mountain is quiet.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.908
Don't worry. Go pack.
We have it under control.

11:40.783 --> 11:44.583
- Look, Mom, I made them all fit!
- Good job, honey.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.418
- Mom, should I take these?
- Sure, those boxes are ready.

11:51.628 --> 11:52.845
Isn't he going to help?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.674
You know what?
He is, actually.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.223
Hi.
How's the packing going?

12:00.803 --> 12:02.476
- Good.
- Really?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.061
That furrow, Kristian...

12:10.021 --> 12:11.694
I thought it would be gone by now.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.454
Something strange happened
with the groundwater today.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.954
That's no longer your job.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.165
That mountain will be there
for another thousand years.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.667
Now finish packing, so
the moving truck can leave tomorrow.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.930
And pack that furrow too.
Get moving!

12:38.883 --> 12:41.557
See how she pushes me around?

12:41.719 --> 12:43.392
Everyone has to contribute, Dad.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.525
How's it going, boss?

13:42.697 --> 13:43.823
I like it here.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.834
I know Geiranger isn't

13:47.452 --> 13:49.500
the center of the universe.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.169
But it's safe.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.088
It's home.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.349
Sondre, I know this is hard.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.349
But Mom and I made the decision

14:06.512 --> 14:09.015
we believe is best for this family.

14:10.892 --> 14:14.647
It isn't always easy
having to make the tough calls.

14:14.812 --> 14:18.658
- But that's life.
- But... what will be next?

14:18.816 --> 14:21.695
After a couple of years in Stavanger.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.955
Will we pack up and move again?

14:24.989 --> 14:28.038
I mean, this whole damn country
is made of rock.

14:49.472 --> 14:52.316
What's this?
Are you moving?

14:53.518 --> 14:54.519
Come here!

14:58.064 --> 15:00.533
- You too!
- And me.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.202
Hi, Sondre.

15:04.112 --> 15:07.286
You may not last long,
with all that pavement...

15:07.448 --> 15:09.917
And Kristian in a tie...

15:10.076 --> 15:12.704
- You like ties!
- It'll sure be different.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.674
- A definite change.
- They strangle me.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.966
- Are you ready?
- More or less.

15:21.129 --> 15:26.511
They're leaving on the ferry now.
I have to work a couple more days.

15:26.676 --> 15:30.806
- You aren't leaving now?
- You aren't rid of me yet.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.525
Dad, it's our turn.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.067
Dad, it's our turn!

17:07.234 --> 17:08.578
Are you going to drive?

17:25.252 --> 17:26.971
Wait here.
This won't take long.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.724
Hi.
I have to show you something.

17:57.076 --> 18:02.378
HOTEL GEIRANGER, Downtown,
1.7 meters above sea level

18:10.256 --> 18:13.226
- Hi, Vibeke.
- You took your sweet time.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.977
I thought I'd give you a hand.

18:15.845 --> 18:19.770
Hi, welcome to Geiranger!
Sorry for the wait.

18:21.309 --> 18:24.939
- May I have your name?
- Maria and Phillip Poulsen.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.072
Let me find your room.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.110
- Are the others gone?
- They're on the ferry.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.574
Imagine if the problem
isn't with the sensors,

18:35.740 --> 18:37.788
but with the wires
down to the sensors.

18:42.705 --> 18:47.211
All mountains consist of plates.
Including ours.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.676
Our bore holes
pass through all the plates.

18:51.088 --> 18:55.844
You said the groundwater disappeared
right before we lost contact.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.728
Groundwater doesn't disappear.
Water doesn't just disappear.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.351
It finds new ways, new layers.

19:03.934 --> 19:08.735
And that creates friction,
which causes the layers to move.

19:09.398 --> 19:13.574
If that movement was big enough,
it may have severed our wires.

19:14.487 --> 19:19.163
Then we'll dig some new holes and put
in new sensors. What's the big deal?

19:21.452 --> 19:24.422
If the weight of the mountain

19:24.580 --> 19:26.799
and the displacement
is big enough...

19:32.838 --> 19:34.758
There'll be no expansion
prior to the rock slide.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.022
There'll be no warning.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.720
EAGLE'S NEST CONTROL STATION

21:36.879 --> 21:39.177
874.1 meters above sea level

21:42.384 --> 21:43.727
Hey, be careful!

21:44.553 --> 21:47.056
That's Geiranger's
biggest tourist attraction.

21:57.066 --> 22:01.663
In a beautiful place like this,
you always want a view.

22:01.821 --> 22:05.451
Of course you do. Let me know
if you need anything else. Bye!

22:11.080 --> 22:12.127
Hi, Sondre.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.667
What?

22:18.546 --> 22:19.638
Where are you now?

23:30.868 --> 23:33.792
Do you have contact?
Can you see us?

23:34.496 --> 23:35.748
Yes, we see you.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.005
That's good to know.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.071
You check four, I'll take five.

24:48.654 --> 24:49.701
Kristian?

25:16.557 --> 25:19.356
This is not natural wear and tear.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.771
No, something's going on.

25:22.062 --> 25:25.862
There's all
kinds of movement up there.

25:26.025 --> 25:30.280
We'll look into it.
We'll figure it out.

25:30.612 --> 25:34.958
- What do you mean?
- Take more tests. Drill more holes.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.583
More holes?
Have you lost your mind?

25:38.746 --> 25:43.752
Do I really have to remind you
of what might happen?

25:44.251 --> 25:47.881
We're talking an 80 meter high wave.

25:48.505 --> 25:51.600
After ten minutes, Geiranger is gone!

25:51.759 --> 25:54.103
We are aware of the consequences.

25:54.261 --> 25:57.731
- It doesn't seem like it!
- What the hell do you want me to do?

26:02.269 --> 26:04.021
Do you want me to push this?

26:05.147 --> 26:09.118
Create total panic?
Cancel the tourist season?

26:09.610 --> 26:14.241
When did you start caring about
how many souvenirs we sold?

26:14.406 --> 26:20.084
We can't cry wolf every time
we suspect something up there.

26:20.370 --> 26:23.044
What do we do
the day it really happens?

26:24.291 --> 26:25.811
Then please tell me:
What do we do now?

26:31.423 --> 26:32.595
Go to Yellow Alert.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.728
Full crew on all shifts,
24-hour watch on the mountain.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.851
What about you guys?
What do you think?

26:43.602 --> 26:46.526
Hm? Are you just
going to watch this happen?

26:50.526 --> 26:51.618
Jacob?

26:58.867 --> 27:00.335
Kristian, listen...

27:01.161 --> 27:05.291
I realize you're upset
and that you mean well.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.093
But you need to calm down now, OK?

27:12.131 --> 27:14.008
We found some torn wires.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.723
Nothing else indicates
anything is about to happen.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.097
The mountain is quiet, Kristian.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.688
OK.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.065
Sorry.

27:27.938 --> 27:29.736
I don't know what came over me.

27:32.109 --> 27:33.281
I won't.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.551
GOT TIRED OF WAITING.
CALL MOM.

28:10.439 --> 28:11.861
You are so screwed.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.087
You have a visitor.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.517
Have you lost your mind?

28:47.809 --> 28:51.814
You can't leave the kids in the car
and go work for hours.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.982
I know.
I'm sorry.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.572
You don't even work there anymore.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.659
- I screwed up.
- Yes, you did.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.749
I got this bad feeling, and...

29:07.162 --> 29:09.039
Well, no Stavanger today.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.175
No.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.755
I guess you guys
are staying at the hotel tonight.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.512
- Cool.
- Is that a plan?

29:21.301 --> 29:23.019
And you can try again tomorrow.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.272
I want to sleep at home.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.400
The house is empty now.
It wouldn't be nice.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.192
But I want to say bye to the house.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.985
If you want to say bye to the house,
we'll do that.

29:39.736 --> 29:40.737
OK?

29:41.530 --> 29:42.610
Let's go back to the house.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.912
- Do you want to join us?
- No.

29:48.078 --> 29:51.298
- I'll get you a hotel room, Sondre.
- Thanks.

29:53.583 --> 29:57.178
Say bye from me too.
Good night, honey.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.807
Bye, boss.
See you tomorrow.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.098
Let's go pack.

30:08.265 --> 30:11.735
- And your name?
- My name is Sondre Eikjord.

30:15.731 --> 30:19.281
- Dad, can I sit up front?
- Of course you can sit up front!

30:30.078 --> 30:32.501
- Buckle up.
- Yup.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.758
- And tighten it.
- Yup.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.260
We're ready.

30:40.922 --> 30:42.595
<i>. Dad?
' Yes?</i>

30:43.300 --> 30:45.223
Are you and Mom getting divorced?

30:46.011 --> 30:47.137
No!

30:47.596 --> 30:49.269
No, we are not getting divorced.

30:51.141 --> 30:54.270
We had a little argument,
and then we'll be friends.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.901
And everything will be OK.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.658
I hope.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.570
- That's life.
- That's life!

31:05.655 --> 31:07.373
Here's your room.

31:09.826 --> 31:10.998
There.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.717
I hope it meets your expectations.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.256
Have fun.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.182
I will.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.094
I have to get back to work.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.930
You know which bottles
not to touch in the minibar, right?

31:32.349 --> 31:35.523
- And which channels not to watch?
- Mom...

31:37.938 --> 31:39.030
Watch out.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.318
Where are you going to sleep, Dad?

31:52.869 --> 31:54.041
Guess I'll take this.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.548
It looks comfy.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.716
There.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.347
You OK?

32:10.011 --> 32:11.604
We don't need a hotel.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.777
No, this place has more soul.

32:18.687 --> 32:19.734
Yeah.

32:22.315 --> 32:23.783
It does, actually.

33:05.484 --> 33:09.785
Dear Kristian, thanks for good years.
Good luck in Stavanger.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.726
Kristian:
I was an idiot today.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.313
I was an idiot today.
Sorry.

34:22.018 --> 34:25.237
I was an idiot today.
Sorry.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.632
God, these beds are horrible!

34:52.007 --> 34:53.007
Yeah.

34:56.177 --> 35:00.853
Too bad it had to end like this.
With Kristian.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.478
Think he'll stay
in the oil industry long?

35:07.480 --> 35:09.949
He'll probably be back within a year.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.534
I'll bet.

35:16.156 --> 35:19.751
These mountains... Once they grab
hold of you, they never let go.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.205
What the hell, Arvid?

35:24.497 --> 35:25.965
I read it in a book.

35:26.833 --> 35:27.959
I'll bet you did.

36:07.624 --> 36:11.720
<i>...they do work on it
at the gym, but...</i>

36:11.878 --> 36:13.596
<i>...gorgeous Voyage,.</i>

36:14.381 --> 36:17.476
<i>Hurtigruten is vital
to people along the coast.</i>

36:18.343 --> 36:21.187
<i>And it is
an amazingly beautiful journey.</i>

36:21.805 --> 36:24.558
<i>Some call it
the world's most beautiful.</i>

36:36.945 --> 36:39.073
- Hi!
- Hi.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.438
<i>Hello?</i>

37:55.565 --> 37:56.657
<i>Mikal?</i>

38:08.787 --> 38:10.084
Damn it!

38:16.753 --> 38:17.879
Shit!

38:23.092 --> 38:24.844
- Margot?
- Yeah?

38:52.372 --> 38:53.464
<i>Arvid?</i>

38:55.542 --> 38:56.634
<i>Jacob?</i>

39:00.797 --> 39:01.844
<i>Hello?</i>

39:04.467 --> 39:05.684
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

39:09.097 --> 39:10.098
<i>Arvid?</i>

39:11.140 --> 39:13.142
- Arvid here.
- Hi.

39:14.185 --> 39:18.156
We're getting some weird data.
It looks like the crevice,

39:18.857 --> 39:20.359
has contracted.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.611
That can't be right.

39:23.653 --> 39:26.031
Several sensors indicate
that it's contracting.

39:30.493 --> 39:34.293
Recalibrate the entire row
and take another reading.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.721
Ready for an evening hike?

39:50.889 --> 39:52.015
You bet.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.400
We'll go have a look.

39:56.102 --> 39:59.982
<i>- What, now?
- Yeah, just to check it out.</i>

40:30.678 --> 40:31.770
<i>Almost down.</i>

40:46.486 --> 40:47.533
Hello?

40:48.821 --> 40:49.947
Hi.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.038
Sure, hang on.

40:53.785 --> 40:54.957
It's Kristian.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.128
Hi.
Miss us already?

40:59.749 --> 41:02.593
Not at all.
We leave tomorrow.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.508
<i>- Everything OK up there?
- Sure.</i>

41:07.674 --> 41:10.427
Just some sensors
that are acting a little strange.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.814
They indicate
that the crevice is contracting.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.646
Contracting?

41:18.309 --> 41:22.280
<i>I know.
It's probably just an error.</i>

41:22.689 --> 41:26.114
<i>Arvid and Jacob
are down there checking now.</i>

41:26.693 --> 41:28.741
<i>We'll have it figured out soon.</i>

41:33.908 --> 41:38.129
- Don't worry. I'll keep you posted.
- Thanks. Talk to you later.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.752
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

42:26.377 --> 42:27.594
What was that?

42:29.881 --> 42:32.509
The geophones
are picking up seismic activity.

42:34.260 --> 42:35.762
<i>Yeah, we felt it here too.</i>

42:41.350 --> 42:43.773
Another 0.8 minus on C6.

43:21.182 --> 43:23.025
Give me the data on C6.

43:23.893 --> 43:27.363
1.72.
Minus 2.6 over the last hour.

43:33.569 --> 43:34.991
Damn!

43:36.906 --> 43:39.580
The same here.
Confirm contraction.

43:40.576 --> 43:43.455
OK, eh...
Should we check number seven, too?

43:48.209 --> 43:49.381
I'll do it.

44:53.149 --> 44:55.447
- Yes?
- Are they still down there?

44:55.818 --> 44:58.412
Yes.
And the data was correct.

44:58.571 --> 45:01.165
Listen to me:
Get them out now!

45:01.324 --> 45:04.373
- What do you mean?
- Put Arvid on!

45:04.744 --> 45:05.791
OK.

45:07.455 --> 45:08.502
Arvid?

45:10.374 --> 45:12.627
- Roger.
- Hang on.

45:14.253 --> 45:17.132
- OK, Kristian.
- Arvid, can you hear me?

45:17.298 --> 45:18.390
<i>Hello?</i>

45:19.008 --> 45:20.055
Kristian?

45:21.093 --> 45:25.644
<i>Get the hell out of there.
Drop whatever you're doing!</i>

45:26.307 --> 45:28.981
We just want to finish up.

45:29.435 --> 45:31.904
I checked Vaiont and Randa.

45:32.063 --> 45:35.283
They both registered contractions
before the rock slides.

45:36.859 --> 45:39.157
<i>The same thing happened there.</i>

45:39.862 --> 45:42.115
Arvid, they didn't expand.

45:43.532 --> 45:44.909
They contracted.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.770
What was that?
What's going on?

46:13.854 --> 46:16.528
- I'm stuck!
- I'll get you loose.

46:17.358 --> 46:19.281
What's going on?
Arvid?

46:19.443 --> 46:21.116
Jacob's foot is stuck!

46:31.205 --> 46:33.958
Don't worry.
I'll get you loose.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.172
What do the sensors say?

46:37.753 --> 46:38.800
Hang on.

46:39.630 --> 46:42.634
The groundwater is sinking.
In several places.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.268
I'm losing contact.
They're all dropping out.

46:50.182 --> 46:52.025
Jacob, don't worry.

47:13.247 --> 47:15.090
Margot, sound the alarm.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.377
- But...
- Margot!

47:19.086 --> 47:20.429
Go to Red Alert.

47:21.047 --> 47:22.264
Go to Red Alert!

47:23.549 --> 47:25.142
<i>Sound the alarm!</i>

48:58.477 --> 48:59.603
What the hell are you doing?

49:01.480 --> 49:02.902
It won't hold both of us.

49:19.582 --> 49:20.799
Arvid!

49:23.669 --> 49:25.262
Arvid!

50:00.372 --> 50:01.589
Hello?

50:02.208 --> 50:03.300
Margot?

50:04.251 --> 50:05.719
Dad, what's going on?

50:20.726 --> 50:22.694
Hi.
What's happening?

50:45.626 --> 50:46.673
Ten.

50:47.836 --> 50:49.008
Ten minutes.

50:51.590 --> 50:54.139
We have ten minutes.
Get the guests out!

50:54.301 --> 50:56.804
Vibeke, try to find the bus driver!

51:04.770 --> 51:05.817
Come on!

51:10.651 --> 51:12.198
Get in.

51:12.486 --> 51:13.487
Buckle up.

51:36.427 --> 51:39.055
For Christ's sake, answer!

51:40.514 --> 51:42.642
<i>This is the voice-mail for...</i>

51:43.183 --> 51:45.811
Wake up! Come on!
You have to get out!

51:46.687 --> 51:50.032
Everyone out of the hotel now!
Everyone out!

51:50.190 --> 51:53.444
Hurry!
Everyone out of the hotel!

51:53.611 --> 51:58.367
- Excuse me, is this a drill?
- No! There's been a rock slide!

52:00.284 --> 52:03.128
Get out! Wake up!
Everyone up!

52:13.213 --> 52:16.137
<i>- Where are you?
- At the hotel.</i>

52:16.425 --> 52:19.099
Getting people out.
Is Julia there?

52:19.386 --> 52:21.263
Yes, I have Julia.
We're in the car.

52:21.430 --> 52:22.431
Good.

52:23.057 --> 52:25.401
Don't bring anything!
Get out!

52:25.559 --> 52:28.688
You don't have time!
Get up in the hills!

52:28.854 --> 52:30.401
Wake up!

52:31.732 --> 52:33.780
Get in the car!

52:36.403 --> 52:38.201
<i>- We're on our way.
- What?</i>

52:38.364 --> 52:41.584
<i>- We can make it.
- No, get to safety.</i>

52:43.827 --> 52:46.956
- Idun, listen. We can make it.
- No!

52:47.122 --> 52:50.126
Just get Julia to safety, OK?

52:52.252 --> 52:54.004
- Promise?
- What about you and Sondre?

52:54.922 --> 52:56.799
We have a bus here.
We'll be fine.

53:01.095 --> 53:02.267
<i>Kristian?</i>

53:08.352 --> 53:09.569
Are you on your way up?

53:13.399 --> 53:14.571
<i>Kristian?</i>

53:16.610 --> 53:17.610
<i>Promise?</i>

53:17.653 --> 53:19.451
Yes, I'll do it.

53:20.781 --> 53:21.782
Good.

53:22.950 --> 53:24.827
<i>Get to higher ground.
I'll see you soon.</i>

53:25.869 --> 53:28.497
We're leaving soon too.
Get out!

53:28.664 --> 53:31.167
<i>Everybody get out now!</i>

54:02.614 --> 54:06.335
- Please, listen to me!
- What about their bags?

54:06.493 --> 54:08.746
- Screw their bags!
- What's going on?

54:09.204 --> 54:12.834
- He refuses to get the bus.
- A tsunami is coming.

54:13.000 --> 54:17.255
We have a few minutes
to get 80 meters above sea level.

54:17.921 --> 54:23.178
- We need to get everyone out now.
- Come on, everyone on the bus!

54:24.052 --> 54:26.771
Sondre...
Sondre?

54:29.433 --> 54:32.027
- Sondre!
- Hurry.

55:31.286 --> 55:33.789
- Come, Julia.
- Now what?

55:33.956 --> 55:35.299
Now we're going to run.

55:36.291 --> 55:41.422
- What are you doing?
- We don't have time. Get up higher!

55:42.673 --> 55:43.970
Sondre?

55:48.428 --> 55:49.520
Sondre?

55:57.187 --> 55:58.234
Sondre?

55:59.022 --> 56:01.275
<i>The subscriber cannot be reached.</i>

56:01.817 --> 56:03.034
Sondre!

56:04.820 --> 56:06.117
Come on!

56:07.281 --> 56:08.703
Get moving!

56:09.950 --> 56:11.247
Out of the car!

56:13.745 --> 56:14.746
Up!

56:15.497 --> 56:16.794
Up to higher ground!

56:18.333 --> 56:20.427
Hey!
Get higher!

56:21.086 --> 56:22.133
Run!

56:25.799 --> 56:27.472
- What's going on?
- Run!

56:34.683 --> 56:37.482
Get on the bus.
We don't have time for that!

56:38.687 --> 56:39.734
Come on.

56:41.106 --> 56:42.323
Come on!

56:46.111 --> 56:47.112
Vibeke?

56:47.738 --> 56:49.411
Have you seen Sondre out here?

56:50.490 --> 56:52.584
No. I saw him earlier tonight,
in the hall.

56:54.494 --> 56:58.544
- We have to go now!
- I can't leave without Sondre.

56:59.458 --> 57:02.632
- Idun!
- I can't leave without my son!

57:03.754 --> 57:04.846
Come on!

57:06.048 --> 57:09.222
- Where are you going?
- To find her son.

57:09.384 --> 57:12.137
- We have to get on the bus.
- Come on!

57:14.890 --> 57:16.767
We won't make it out!

57:39.498 --> 57:41.876
Thomas, listen to me.
Get out and run.

57:42.626 --> 57:45.300
Come on!
Teresa, get out!

57:48.966 --> 57:50.718
Run, run, run!
Come on!

57:55.347 --> 57:57.315
- Anna!
- Mom!

58:19.663 --> 58:23.793
- Get the kids to higher ground!
- Run, Thomas!

58:24.459 --> 58:28.089
- Run as fast as you can! Hurry!
- Dad!

58:28.797 --> 58:30.014
Run!

58:53.321 --> 58:54.698
We won't make it.

58:57.451 --> 58:59.704
Kristian, you have to run!

59:15.218 --> 59:16.515
Seat belt.

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:12.318
- Sondre!
- Sondre?

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:14.987
- Sondre!
- We have to get back.

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:19.700
Listen to me, dammit!
We're going back to that bus now.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.504
Quiet!
I hear something.

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.291
Sondre?

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.260
- Someone is down there.
- Sondre?

01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:33.923
Sondre?

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.137
Sondre!

01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:40.642
- What's going on?
- Come! Run!

01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:59.160
There's a bomb shelter
in the basement. Come on!

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.161
Maria!

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.422
Come on!

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.994
- Maria!
- Run!

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.370
Mom!

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:51.466
Maria!

01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:58.677
Maria!

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:02.473
Phillip!

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.066
Maria!

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.826
Close the door!

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:19.110
Maria!

01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:22.406
- Close the door!
- She's out there!

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.037
Maria!

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.500
We have to close the door
or we'll all die!

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.673
She's gone.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.418
She's gone.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:39.507
Phillip, she's gone.
We have to close the door!

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:32.645
Julia...

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:54.033
<i>Hello?</i>

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:57.791
<i>Hello?</i>

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:00.873
Jacob?

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:03.751
Margot...

01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:05.845
Are you OK?

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.298
<i>Is Arvid OK?</i>

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.181
<i>Jacob?</i>

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:17.182
<i>Jacob, is Arvid there?</i>

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:20.685
<i>Jacob?</i>

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.926
Julia?

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.773
Julia?

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:10.614
Julia!

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:16.662
Julia!

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.244
- Dad!
- Julia?

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:20.582
Dad!

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.299
Dad...

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:31.343
Let me look at you.

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:34.931
Are you all right?
Come here.

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:36.348
Are you OK?

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.679
<i>The subscriber cannot be reached.</i>

01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:07.393
I see.

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:10.979
No, a lot of people
don't have coverage up here.

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:14.524
Yes.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:20.491
- Where are those people?
- On a hill above Geiranger.

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:25.082
Many people are up there
by the cabins.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:28.005
May I please borrow that?

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:35.837
I was wondering...

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:40.221
There was a tourist bus
from the hotel...

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:44.014
There's no bus up where you are?

01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:51.694
Are you sure?

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:07.078
Thank you.

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.062
- Hi.
- Where are Mom and Sondre?

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:43.369
- Dad's going to go find them now.
- I don't want you to leave.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.743
I understand that.

01:10:48.119 --> 01:10:51.714
But Mom is very worried
about us right now.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.919
So I have to find her.
Tell her we're OK.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:11:00.716
- You want me to stay here alone?
- No, you won't be alone.

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:02.850
You'll be with Teresa and Thomas.

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:07.017
Know what I think?

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:12.353
Thomas would be very happy if
you could help take care of Teresa.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.813
Think you could do that?

01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:25.957
You're a brave little girl.
And so amazing.

01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:31.454
You stay here...

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:36.334
- And I'll go find Mom.
- And Sondre.

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:38.219
And Sondre, of course.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:44.638
Good girl.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.103
The door, Sondre.

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.231
Wait, wait!

01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:35.484
Now push!

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.658
Come on!

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:19.603
Give me that lamp.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:21.610
Help me up.

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:12.247
Take off your coat.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.418
Take off your coat!

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:31.467
- Fuck this!
- Come on!

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:36.231
- It's hopeless!
- Would you rather be out there?

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:40.360
Calm down. Let's wait
till the water is above the door.

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:43.112
When the pressure is lower,
we'll try again.

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:47.613
If we wait down here
any longer, we'll die!

01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:55.453
If we wait down here, we'll die!

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:34.931
Hello?

01:16:38.969 --> 01:16:40.312
Hello?

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:20.078
Hello?

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:10.204
Idun?

01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:14.421
Sondre?

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:22.569
BOMB SHELTER

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.632
Let's try now.

01:21:33.347 --> 01:21:35.566
Get over to the shaft.

01:21:58.705 --> 01:22:00.252
Phillip, are you OK?

01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:05.213
You can hold onto the ceiling.

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:09.600
Calm down.

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:14.721
Hey!
What are you doing?

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:20.769
- Calm down! Let go of him!
- I'm not dying in here!

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.116
Phillip, calm down.

01:22:27.234 --> 01:22:31.990
- Let go of me, dammit!
- Phillip, don't panic now.

01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:35.080
- I'm not dying in here!
- You won't!

01:22:35.242 --> 01:22:37.836
- Calm down!
- Shut up!

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:45.502
Phillip!

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.934
Let him go!

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:53.264
Shut up!

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:55.220
Let 90!

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:25.049
Don't look.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:11.763
Hello?

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:28.946
Idun?

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.237
Sondre?

01:24:34.194 --> 01:24:35.320
Idun?

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:00.387
Sondre?

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:37.975
Sondre...

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.760
I'm so sorry.

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:46.687
Sondre!

01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:51.947
Hang on.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:55.735
Hang on.

01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:45.970
- We're down here!
- Hello?

01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:49.307
We're here!

01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:03.783
Wait here.

01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:10.785
Hello?

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:21.387
We're here!

01:29:55.849 --> 01:29:56.975
Sondre...

01:29:57.934 --> 01:29:58.981
Wait here.

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:10.636
Hi!
Oh, God!

01:31:15.929 --> 01:31:18.057
I'm here now.

01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:21.602
Everything will be fine, Sondre.
Are you hurt?

01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:24.230
Can you move?

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:27.403
You'll be OK.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.994
Mom is waiting for us outside.

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:39.286
We just have to take one last swim.

01:31:39.452 --> 01:31:41.921
- Yes, we do.
- Dad, please!

01:31:42.122 --> 01:31:44.750
Listen to me.
The water is rising in here.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:48.258
Soon we'll run out of air.
And then we'll die.

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:52.759
And I can't allow that.
Mom and I need you.

01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:55.969
And Julia needs you.

01:31:56.970 --> 01:32:00.019
Look at me!
We all need you.

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:14.829
I'll swim first.

01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:17.202
You swim right after me.

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:21.628
I'll keep an eye on you
the entire way. Ready?

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:24.626
Let's do it.

01:32:28.793 --> 01:32:29.840
One...

01:32:31.463 --> 01:32:32.464
Two...

01:32:34.007 --> 01:32:35.099
Three!

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.077
Sondre!

01:33:58.091 --> 01:34:00.594
- Where is Dad?
- He was right behind me.

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:50.813
No way...

01:36:55.768 --> 01:36:56.940
Dad!

01:36:58.730 --> 01:37:00.403
Dad, please!

01:37:02.233 --> 01:37:03.450
Come on!

01:37:09.824 --> 01:37:11.121
Dad!

01:39:12.905 --> 01:39:14.031
Mom!

01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:41.502
THE AKERNES CREVICE
IS MONITORED CONTINUOUSLY.

01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:45.211
IT IS STILL EXPANDING
BY UP TO 15 CM ANNUALLY.

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:49.128
ALL EXPERTS AGREE
THERE WILL BE A ROCK SLIDE.

01:40:49.293 --> 01:40:55.300
THEY DO NOT KNOW WHEN.

01:45:02.004 --> 01:45:06.851
THE WAVE
