WEBVTT

00:08.020 --> 00:09.499
Oh, let me help you with that, Sam.

00:09.768 --> 00:12.043
That's okay, Woody.
I'm not as old as I look.

00:12.307 --> 00:13.581
Really?

00:14.638 --> 00:18.790
Sam, I don't know if this would interest
you, but I have an extra ticket tonight,

00:19.134 --> 00:22.285
Jacques Brel Is Alive
and Well and Living in Paris.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.661
He's not doing that underwater
stuff anymore?

00:28.500 --> 00:32.459
Jacques Brel was a Belgian balladeer
who wrote songs

00:32.787 --> 00:35.176
of great passion and power
in the '50s and '60s.

00:35.659 --> 00:38.298
You mean like "Who Put the Bop in
the Bop Sh-bop Sh-bop"?

00:38.615 --> 00:40.253
So you're busy.

00:42.194 --> 00:43.388
"Who Put the Bop"?

00:43.651 --> 00:45.687
Yeah, you remember that?
The great old song,

00:45.941 --> 00:48.375
- right up there with "Yakety Yak."
- "Yakety Yak"?

00:49.437 --> 00:52.235
Oh, come on, you remember
the Coasters, don't you?

00:52.518 --> 00:54.156
- No.
- You're kidding.

00:54.391 --> 00:57.144
How about the Shirelles
or the Platters or Dixie Cups?

00:57.846 --> 00:58.995
Sorry.

00:59.802 --> 01:01.997
You don't remember any
of those old groups?

01:02.258 --> 01:05.489
Oh, old groups. You mean like Devo.

01:06.545 --> 01:08.979
Maybe you better take this.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.136 --> 02:25.092
Off to class, huh?
What do you got today?

02:25.384 --> 02:29.059
Sissy French Painters
of the 1 7th Century.

02:30.046 --> 02:33.322
As a matter of fact, I'm on my way
to my Beginning Mime class.

02:33.667 --> 02:36.943
- "Meem"?
- Most people pronounce it mime.

02:37.289 --> 02:38.642
Mime?

02:39.828 --> 02:42.820
Yeah, you know, Woody, those guys
with white paint all over their faces

02:43.116 --> 02:46.074
so bouncy and happy you just
wanna strangle them.

02:46.571 --> 02:47.799
You're not serious.

02:48.028 --> 02:50.588
- Everyone loves a mime.
- No, everybody loves a clown.

02:50.858 --> 02:53.452
Everybody hates a mime.

02:53.731 --> 02:55.164
That's simply not true.

02:55.396 --> 02:57.910
Well, you know, I saw this guy
on the Common one day.

02:58.184 --> 02:59.697
Did an amazing performance.

02:59.933 --> 03:03.403
He-- He did a crane, a mother crane,
feeding its young.

03:03.721 --> 03:07.157
Turns out the guy was actually
choking on a piece of gum.

03:07.675 --> 03:09.074
But I was moved, frankly.

03:09.340 --> 03:11.934
Yeah, well, you know, Norm, you can
make light of it all you want,

03:12.212 --> 03:13.691
but it is an ancient art form.

03:13.919 --> 03:17.594
It has been around since the times
of Caesar Augustine.

03:17.915 --> 03:21.544
Yeah? So have those socks
you're wearing. Who cares?

03:21.869 --> 03:25.703
Well, you know, it is the purest form
of communication.

03:26.115 --> 03:29.266
Diane, why don't you give us
a little exhibition here.

03:29.570 --> 03:35.042
Oh, I couldn't. I'm really just a novice.
I've only had three lessons. All right.

03:36.688 --> 03:40.920
Oh, all right, ladies and gentlemen,
Diane, the "mimette."

03:41.641 --> 03:46.032
All right, she's starting off here with
your basic cop directing traffic.

03:47.635 --> 03:51.310
And segueing into a waiter carrying
a heavy tray of dishes.

03:51.631 --> 03:57.786
Yes, good. And completing it with
the midget imitating Judy Garland.

03:58.250 --> 04:01.287
Very nice, bravo, bravo!

04:03.370 --> 04:04.849
Very good.

04:05.076 --> 04:07.431
It was a person trapped
in a shrinking box.

04:07.699 --> 04:12.375
I'd say you'd better scurry off to class.
You got a lot of practicing to do.

04:12.736 --> 04:14.852
Now, that I know.

04:15.108 --> 04:18.543
- Hey, Sammy, mail in?
- Yeah, there you go.

04:27.055 --> 04:30.764
- You expecting something special?
- Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.

04:31.092 --> 04:33.287
It's too depressing.

04:33.548 --> 04:35.379
Oh, come on.
We're your buddies here.

04:35.671 --> 04:38.947
Yeah, you don't wanna keep
that stuff inside, Carla. It'll eat you up.

04:39.292 --> 04:40.691
Oh, yeah, it's just what I need.

04:40.916 --> 04:43.191
You chowderheads trying
to solve my problems.

04:43.497 --> 04:45.488
Come on now, I'd say that four brains

04:45.744 --> 04:48.975
plus whatever Cliffy has
are better than one.

04:49.324 --> 04:51.440
Come on. We wanna help.
Let us help.

04:51.738 --> 04:54.775
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay, try this one for size.

04:55.068 --> 04:59.220
In case you haven't noticed, my luck
with men hasn't been so great lately.

04:59.564 --> 05:02.317
In fact, all my dates fall
into two categories:

05:02.603 --> 05:05.879
geeks and those studying
to enter the geekhood.

05:07.181 --> 05:12.209
So in order to increase my odds,
I decided to enlist the full resources

05:12.593 --> 05:18.111
of the media. I put this ad in
the personals of Boston Scene.

05:18.504 --> 05:21.655
So it's been two weeks,
and no one has answered.

05:21.958 --> 05:23.789
Can you help with that?

05:24.040 --> 05:25.234
- Well, all right.
- Yeah.

05:25.455 --> 05:28.447
Give us a second here.
All right, guys?

05:34.529 --> 05:37.089
- Hey.
- Yeah, what? What do you got?

05:37.360 --> 05:40.238
You got a crack in
the ceiling there, Sammy.

05:40.565 --> 05:42.044
Just what I thought. Thanks, guys.

05:42.272 --> 05:43.910
Oh, come on, come on
back here, would you?

05:44.145 --> 05:46.454
We're just kidding now.
Now we're gonna really help.

05:46.767 --> 05:48.359
Hey, why would he write you
here anyway?

05:48.640 --> 05:50.596
Well, you think I want some
sex-starved creep

05:50.846 --> 05:54.316
camped out on my doorstep? One
of my neighbours might get him first.

05:54.634 --> 05:56.625
Just let me-- Let me see the ad.
Which one is it?

05:56.882 --> 05:59.919
Right there. Right after
"speed eater seeks same."

06:00.212 --> 06:01.884
All right, all right.

06:03.417 --> 06:08.571
"Divorced female, warm, witty
and ltalian in every way except fat."

06:08.995 --> 06:11.031
- Well, sounds good so far.
- Yeah.

06:11.285 --> 06:14.357
"Thirty-three, 5-foot
and a quarter inch,

06:14.656 --> 06:19.127
dark brown hair, brown eyes,
no visible scars, tattoos or birthmarks.

06:20.234 --> 06:23.112
Seeking possible serious relationship.

06:23.439 --> 06:29.230
Note, I have six children.
This is not a misprint. Six."

06:29.641 --> 06:33.156
Oh, my, I can't believe not
one guy has answered this.

06:33.512 --> 06:36.788
Carla, my dear, you're forgetting,
like, the basic principle of advertising.

06:37.176 --> 06:38.894
Lying.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.933
Oh, sure, I could tell him
I got no kids, right?

06:42.212 --> 06:45.727
- Right. Right.
- I could tell him that I'm 21, 5'9",

06:46.042 --> 06:47.794
- Right.
- gorgeous green eyes,

06:48.040 --> 06:51.510
flaming red hair
and ta-tas till Tuesday.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.501
But how am I gonna explain the way
I really look when he sees me?

06:54.825 --> 06:56.144
Stress?

06:56.406 --> 07:00.524
Hey, all right, next time I spill my guts,
remind me to do it in front of friends.

07:00.902 --> 07:03.700
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
- I am in no mood to be cheered up.

07:03.982 --> 07:07.736
Next guy tries to cheer me up
is gonna get open-face surgery.

07:09.685 --> 07:14.759
I don't get it. She's got ta-tas
till Monday afternoon at least.

07:15.512 --> 07:18.026
Boy, she's really bad off.
Come on, come on, listen,

07:18.343 --> 07:20.015
we gotta think here now.
All right, come on,

07:20.258 --> 07:24.649
put ourselves in her place. What would
I do if I couldn't get a date?

07:25.003 --> 07:26.482
Who am I kidding?

07:26.751 --> 07:29.902
- Well, why don't one of us write her?
- You wanna date her?

07:30.206 --> 07:33.835
No, no, no. No, I think he means,
why don't we make up a guy?

07:34.993 --> 07:37.632
I don't know, man. Make up a guy,
it's just too risky. Too risky.

07:37.949 --> 07:40.702
Yeah, she'd suspect something
the minute she met him.

07:41.945 --> 07:44.982
No, no, no, we wouldn't have
to let it go that far.

07:45.275 --> 07:48.347
In the meantime, we're giving her hope,
a little confidence. The more confident

07:48.646 --> 07:51.524
she is, the more attractive she'll feel.
That'll make her more attractive

07:51.810 --> 07:53.528
to some real guy.
Or something like that.

07:53.766 --> 07:55.165
- Sounds good.
- All right, I'm in.

07:55.390 --> 07:57.745
- Okay?
- Yep, we got two.

07:58.012 --> 07:59.730
All for one, one for all, huh?

08:00.010 --> 08:03.525
Gee, Mr Clavin, your hands
are soft like a girl's.

08:04.464 --> 08:08.855
My feet have got calluses on them,
just like every other part of my body.

08:09.209 --> 08:12.360
Woody, get me some paper there.
Hey, Carla's gonna love this,

08:12.664 --> 08:15.462
don't you think? I hope she realizes
what great friends she has here.

08:15.786 --> 08:18.664
You bet. She will. And if she doesn't,
what do you say we just have

08:18.950 --> 08:20.781
- this guy dump all over her?
- Good idea.

08:21.072 --> 08:23.745
- We don't have any with lines.
- That's okay, I'll be careful.

08:24.069 --> 08:25.263
Okay, before we start writing,

08:25.485 --> 08:27.760
I suggest we just figure out
who exactly this guy is.

08:28.024 --> 08:30.413
No, we're making him up.
He can be anybody we want him to be.

08:30.688 --> 08:31.677
Doctor, ski instructor--

08:31.895 --> 08:34.534
No, that's the point. If the guy's too
fabulous, she'll be on to us.

08:34.850 --> 08:36.966
All right, it's gotta be
somebody, though, who's not

08:37.222 --> 08:38.621
in her league usually.

08:38.888 --> 08:41.038
We could make him a postman.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.593
- No, no, too much.
- No, no.

08:44.924 --> 08:48.314
Boy, you guys, we're sunk already.
She asked for a picture.

08:48.670 --> 08:51.503
Yeah? Now, wait-- Wait a second.
Here, we're back afloat here.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.908
Check this out.
How's this for your basic stud?

08:54.206 --> 08:56.845
- Oh, oh, nice.
- Oh, nice, great. Who is he?

08:57.162 --> 08:59.960
No idea. Just came with the wallet.

09:04.529 --> 09:08.283
Hey, look at this.
Letter for Carla Tortelli.

09:08.650 --> 09:11.164
- What?
- My goodness.

09:11.439 --> 09:15.227
- Let me see. Come on, come on!
- What's the magic word?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.835
- Gelding.
- That's the one.

09:19.306 --> 09:20.534
What is it, Carla?

09:20.763 --> 09:24.802
Someone or thing had the nerve
to answer my ad.

09:25.175 --> 09:29.453
Okay, everybody, gather around
for a good laugh.

09:29.838 --> 09:32.830
"My dearest Carla,

09:33.126 --> 09:37.358
I was intrigued by your warm,
honest ad.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.700
I'll be candid as well.
I was married myself,

09:43.033 --> 09:46.343
but, sadly, it failed.

09:49.443 --> 09:54.312
I'm not much for bars
or the singles scene.

09:54.688 --> 09:58.124
I prefer a quiet night, a warm fire
and pleasant company."

09:58.684 --> 10:01.756
- Very sensitive, very sensitive.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:02.763 --> 10:07.234
"I'd love to meet you soon,
but unfortunately my job

10:07.592 --> 10:10.060
as an international airline pilot

10:10.381 --> 10:15.614
keeps me real busy flying places
most people only dream about."

10:17.124 --> 10:19.684
- Talking adventuresome.
- Yeah.

10:20.745 --> 10:24.943
"For the moment, then, we'll have to
depend on the U.S. Postal Service."

10:25.324 --> 10:26.996
No trouble there.

10:27.239 --> 10:31.232
"Sincerely, Mitch Wainwright.

10:31.568 --> 10:35.447
- P.S., I love kids."
- Oh, no, you're kidding me. Boy.

10:35.772 --> 10:38.605
You really hit the mother lode
there, didn't you?

10:38.936 --> 10:41.131
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

10:41.392 --> 10:42.620
What do you want?

10:42.848 --> 10:46.887
Well, I guess he does sound
kind of great.

10:47.261 --> 10:48.933
- You bet he does.
- Yeah.

10:49.175 --> 10:53.134
Carla, you have no way of knowing
if this man is telling the truth

10:53.463 --> 10:56.614
- about himself.
- Don't you think I've thought of that?

10:56.918 --> 11:00.035
But if this guy is only half as good
as he sounds, he's twice as good

11:00.331 --> 11:02.891
as any of the dirtbags I've ever dated.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.471
- I just wish he'd sent a picture.
- He did.

11:05.784 --> 11:07.581
- What?
- Probably. He probably did.

11:07.865 --> 11:10.220
- Yeah.
- Check in the envelope there. Check.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.242
- There is a picture.
- You're kidding.

11:13.485 --> 11:15.794
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey.

11:16.065 --> 11:20.138
- Come to Mama.
- Oh, look at that guy.

11:20.519 --> 11:21.838
- Handsome.
- Oh, yeah.

11:22.059 --> 11:25.574
Hey, how about that?
Good times, huh?

11:25.889 --> 11:27.959
- Yeah.
- There's something suspicious

11:28.220 --> 11:31.929
- about this whole situation.
- No, there's nothing suspicious here.

11:33.007 --> 11:36.920
- How do you know?
- I know. I know.

11:37.711 --> 11:42.227
Sam, is this your handiwork?

11:46.077 --> 11:48.671
I can't believe you did something
this stupid.

11:48.991 --> 11:51.425
She was depressed. We were
trying to help her out. That's all.

11:51.738 --> 11:55.333
Nothing's going to top the depression
of going after the man of her dreams

11:55.651 --> 11:59.326
and finding you there. Believe me,
I know whereof I speak.

11:59.897 --> 12:02.570
There's no way she's gonna find out.

12:03.227 --> 12:05.104
Hey, this guy looks familiar.

12:05.933 --> 12:09.243
- Where have I seen this face before?
- Probably the airport.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.873
- Yeah.
- Pilots hang out there.

12:11.094 --> 12:13.654
- All the time.
- I got it.

12:13.925 --> 12:16.314
He's in a frame I just bought
at Woolworth's.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.351
You're kidding.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.959
Oh, my God. He's a model too.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.229
Is that right?

12:39.900 --> 12:43.256
So did Carla get the latest edition
of the Mitch Gazette yet?

12:43.612 --> 12:45.603
Yeah, she's in the back reading
it right now.

12:46.156 --> 12:49.751
Have you noticed how Carla is
kind of perking up lately?

12:50.077 --> 12:53.911
I'll admit she's much less repulsive.

12:54.290 --> 12:57.760
Bordering on sufferable, but that
doesn't make what you're doing right.

12:58.085 --> 13:00.553
Oh, come on, give her her moment
in the sun there.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.758
I mean, after all,
you had yours with me.

13:04.925 --> 13:09.919
You're not referring to that
nanosecond under a penlight are you?

13:17.396 --> 13:20.627
Oh, no, what--?

13:21.901 --> 13:24.779
- What is that?
- A little surprise I have for you, Sam.

13:25.071 --> 13:29.587
I hate surprises. And you know
what else I hate.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.750
Bravo!

13:33.996 --> 13:36.191
Sam, I'd like you to meet
Lev Agajanian,

13:36.457 --> 13:39.688
better known as Sotto the Mime.
Sotto, this is Sam Malone.

13:40.003 --> 13:44.554
Oh, hi. Oh, that's very funny,
very funny.

13:46.134 --> 13:49.888
- Get him out of here, please.
- Sam, be nice.

13:50.221 --> 13:53.452
Sotto is our mime-in-residence at
the college and a visitor to this country.

13:53.766 --> 13:57.759
- Whatever.
- Hi! My name's Woody Boyd!

13:58.146 --> 14:02.264
- Woody, you don't have to shout.
- Oh, he's a lip-reader.

14:02.609 --> 14:06.238
Sam, what would you say if I told you
that Sotto has generously offered

14:06.571 --> 14:08.084
to entertain your customers?

14:08.323 --> 14:10.120
- No.
- Oh, please.

14:10.367 --> 14:12.005
- No.
- I predict that by the end

14:12.243 --> 14:15.474
of the evening you'll have
fallen in love with this art form,

14:15.789 --> 14:18.826
and Sotto will have picked up
a lot of spare change.

14:20.210 --> 14:23.407
See, this is the stuff I hate.

14:25.090 --> 14:28.287
Sam, this is his art.

14:28.593 --> 14:32.063
- Well, just keep his art out of my face.
- Thank you, Sam.

14:32.389 --> 14:34.857
Hey, would you please get off
my bar there?

14:35.142 --> 14:36.495
You won't regret this.

14:37.394 --> 14:41.023
Oh, so where's your flyboy
off to this time, Carla?

14:41.356 --> 14:45.349
Cairo. He's gonna buzz the Sphinx
for me in his 747.

14:46.612 --> 14:48.284
Good Lord.

14:49.114 --> 14:55.189
Even the stick's jealous. I just can't
wait to meet this guy face to face.

14:55.621 --> 14:57.930
Although I am gonna play hard to get.

14:58.207 --> 15:01.597
I intend to meet him
with all my clothes on.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.154
Carla, since you mentioned it,

15:03.379 --> 15:05.256
when are you going to meet
this Mitch fellow?

15:05.506 --> 15:07.701
Well, he's doing the Paris
to Bombay flight now.

15:07.967 --> 15:10.879
I have to wait until they switch him
back to the domestic route.

15:11.428 --> 15:13.988
- You know, life's funny.
- Why is that?

15:14.306 --> 15:18.060
I mean, today I'm with Mitch
on top of the world.

15:18.394 --> 15:21.033
And just a couple of weeks ago,
I'd have settled for fish bait

15:21.313 --> 15:24.749
- like Vinnie Claussen.
- Who's Vinnie Claussen?

15:25.109 --> 15:28.465
Some loser who had the nerve
to answer my ad.

15:31.782 --> 15:33.898
Carla? Yeah, wait, wait,
hold on a second here.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.118
Listen, maybe you should
reconsider this.

15:37.413 --> 15:39.768
- You know, Mitch is out of town a lot.
- Yeah.

15:40.041 --> 15:42.635
Maybe you might like this Vinnie guy.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.951
Yeah, there's nothing wrong
with playing the field.

15:45.213 --> 15:47.329
Except with someone
who's grazing in it.

15:47.590 --> 15:49.740
- What are you talking about?
- Look at this guy.

15:50.009 --> 15:51.488
Fetch.

15:52.345 --> 15:54.620
Really, take a look at him.
He's not that bad-looking.

15:54.889 --> 15:57.801
Yeah, but next to Mitch
he looks like a weasel.

15:58.101 --> 15:59.898
But looks aren't everything, Carla.

16:00.186 --> 16:02.700
I mean, Vinnie, I bet he's got
a lot of stuff going for him.

16:02.981 --> 16:05.893
Oh, I don't know about you, but being
a funeral director seems darn near

16:06.192 --> 16:09.150
- as thrilling as aviation to me.
- Yeah, they got flowers, limousines.

16:09.445 --> 16:13.643
Hey, forget it, forget it, all right?
I'm through with bozos like that.

16:13.992 --> 16:16.950
I'm at the University of Mitch now.

16:19.831 --> 16:23.187
Well, I hope you're all
proud of yourselves.

16:23.501 --> 16:26.573
Carla is now turning down living,
breathing human beings

16:26.880 --> 16:28.677
for your mythical aviator.

16:29.215 --> 16:31.285
Guys, how come we didn't see
this one coming?

16:31.843 --> 16:36.598
Oh, this from a group who every year
fails to see winter coming.

16:38.683 --> 16:42.471
Thanks for reminding me, Diane.
I gotta take those screens down.

16:49.069 --> 16:51.424
Hey, Sam, what time does
the floor show end?

16:51.697 --> 16:53.574
Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it.

16:53.824 --> 16:56.497
Hey, come here, come here,
come here.

16:56.785 --> 17:00.414
Listen, Sotto, we gotta talk.

17:01.999 --> 17:05.275
Yeah, all right, all right.
Now, don't do this.

17:05.836 --> 17:08.191
Listen, the whole--

17:10.465 --> 17:12.855
That's very clever, yeah.

17:13.135 --> 17:16.684
Listen, you've been here three hours.
This is just not working out.

17:17.013 --> 17:19.005
I'm gonna start losing customers here.

17:19.266 --> 17:21.780
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

17:22.102 --> 17:24.093
Now, I want you to beat
