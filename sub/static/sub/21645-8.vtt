WEBVTT

00:46.800 --> 00:49.395
And now the other way.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.910
Please don't let me interrupt the recital.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.398
Uncle Leopold.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.315
- What a surprise.
- I know I should have written.

01:07.480 --> 01:11.554
But I'm afraid I acted on impulse.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.996
I wanted to see my family.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.559
I missed your birthday, Albert.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.351
I wanted you to have something
to remember me by.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.673
How thoughtful.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.879
Please excuse me.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.791
Albert does not seem in
a very receptive mood.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.031
Are you surprised?

01:54.600 --> 01:58.071
Everything I do is for
the family, Victoria.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.197
Really?

02:00.360 --> 02:03.558
I don't see how your revelation
has helped Albert.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.758
I think a real father
would not have been so selfish.

02:10.199 --> 02:15.036
What you are suggesting, Prime Minister,
will be the death of British agriculture.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.830
There are more people living in our towns
now than in the countryside, Stanley.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.153
Free trade is the only way to make
food affordable to everyone.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.514
We have a responsibility to those
less fortunate than ourselves.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.275
- I take care of my people, Prime Minister.
- No doubt.

02:31.440 --> 02:35.639
But I'm talking about members of the labouring
classes not lucky enough to work for you.

02:37.400 --> 02:42.031
I won't do it. I gave my word as a
gentleman to uphold the Corn Laws,

02:42.200 --> 02:44.192
and I'm not in the habit
of breaking my word.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.716
Duke?

02:58.880 --> 03:01.236
20 years ago, when I became Prime Minister,

03:01.400 --> 03:05.633
I thought I could never support
Catholic emancipation.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.674
But when I took office, I
realised that a leader

03:09.840 --> 03:14.517
must put the good of his country
before his own inclinations.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.078
Or even the will of his party.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.239
You have my support, Prime Minister.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.235
"And the King destroyed
all the spinning wheels in the land."

03:25.760 --> 03:27.877
I remember this story, Lehzen.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.949
You used to read it to
me when I was little.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.191
Why is it so cold in here?

03:38.960 --> 03:42.032
Baroness,
how many times do I have to ask you?

03:42.200 --> 03:46.592
Please... do not leave the windows open
whilst Vicky is in the nursery.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.313
She has such a delicate constitution.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.676
I have asked you many times before.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.560
We cannot allow her to catch a chill.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.393
What an old nanny goat you are, Albert.

03:57.560 --> 04:01.315
Really, I had the windows open all the time
when I was at Kensington, didn't I?

04:01.480 --> 04:06.077
Yes, Majesty. The benefits of fresh air
are considerable in my view.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.312
- More story!
- Yes, darling, but first,

04:09.480 --> 04:13.713
Mama is just going to open up this window
for some fresh air.

04:15.320 --> 04:18.791
Very well. I shall leave you to your...

04:18.959 --> 04:21.475
fairy tales.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.751
You look like Narcissus,

04:31.920 --> 04:34.276
wondering who the beautiful creature

04:34.440 --> 04:37.035
gazing back at him from the pool
could possibly be.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.556
Narcissus was a man.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.599
This woman is just thinking
how haggard she looks.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.592
That's exactly what I was thinking, too.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.676
Forgive me for interrupting
your tête-à-tête,

05:00.840 --> 05:04.959
but I wonder if I might steal
my nephew from you, Duchess?

05:05.120 --> 05:07.999
We have some Coburg matters to discuss.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.117
Certainly.

05:16.480 --> 05:20.633
Have you heard of the English saying,
"a bull in the china shop"?

05:20.800 --> 05:24.191
But I am famous
throughout the courts of Europe

05:24.360 --> 05:26.591
for my tact, Ernest.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.070
Hm.

05:29.920 --> 05:34.915
It is time for this House
to decide the fate of England.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.198
- Will we advance into the future?
- Hear, hear!

05:38.360 --> 05:41.478
Or recede into the past?

05:41.640 --> 05:44.633
Is this a country that can only flourish

05:44.800 --> 05:49.556
in the sickly atmosphere
of prohibition and tariffs?

05:49.720 --> 05:54.556
Let trade be free between nations.

05:54.720 --> 05:58.316
Choose the future, not the past!

06:03.840 --> 06:06.116
The Honourable Member for Lincoln.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.078
Mr Speaker,

06:08.240 --> 06:11.517
is the Tory party really going to stand by

06:11.680 --> 06:16.800
while our Prime Minister renders us
dependent on foreigners for food

06:16.960 --> 06:21.716
because he has listened
to the clamour of the mob?

06:21.880 --> 06:26.511
I call upon all like-minded Tories

06:26.680 --> 06:31.914
to join me in resisting
with every parliamentary means

06:32.080 --> 06:35.630
this heinous betrayal of every virtue

06:35.800 --> 06:39.032
that our great party stands for!

06:42.600 --> 06:45.752
Sir Robert Peel may be a friend
to the working man,

06:45.920 --> 06:47.957
but he's a traitor to his party.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.157
The Corn Laws, Mr Penge?

06:50.320 --> 06:53.836
He's caving in to the demands
of the Anti-Corn Law League.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.878
People are starving, Mr Penge.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.350
Sometimes a man must do
what he believes to be right.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.318
Sooner or later.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.919
The opposition to repeal
is all from my own party.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.958
You're the only man who can pass this bill.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.679
You may be right, Ma'am,

07:08.840 --> 07:11.992
but even if I am successful,
it will be the end of my career.

07:12.160 --> 07:15.756
- They will never forgive me.
- Don't say that. Your country needs you.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.118
So do I. Not to mention Albert would be...

07:19.280 --> 07:21.158
Albert will be what?

07:21.320 --> 07:23.710
Astonished if the Repeal Bill did not pass.

07:23.880 --> 07:27.590
- Oh, of course it will pass.
- I hope you are right, Sir.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.071
Do you know what I think, Sir Robert?

07:32.440 --> 07:35.831
Five years from now, when the new
Parliament building is completed,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.676
I believe you will be
the prime minister that opens it.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.237
Is that the Bible, Miss Coke?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.232
On a Wednesday?

07:51.400 --> 07:54.438
I was just reading about
David and Jonathan.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.399
When Jonathan dies, David says he loves him

07:57.560 --> 07:59.472
with a love surpassing women.

08:01.040 --> 08:05.000
I never knew that the
Bible could be so tender.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.794
- You look smart. Are you going out for dinner?
- Yes, I am.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.397
- I hope you enjoy yourself.
- Thank you, Miss Coke.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.992
My apologies.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.551
The Corn Laws debate will go on for days.

08:31.720 --> 08:36.476
The sleeping beauties on our back benches
have woken up and they aren't happy.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.836
I know. My father and his
friends think repeal

08:39.000 --> 08:41.559
will be the end of
civilisation as we know it.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.916
With respect,
the days when men like your father

08:44.080 --> 08:46.470
will rule this country
are coming to an end.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.995
Well... poor Papa.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.117
- Let's not talk about politics.
- No. Oysters and champagne.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.272
Yes, sir.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.632
There's something I must tell you.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.998
You've set a date, haven't you,
for your wedding?

09:04.160 --> 09:06.720
I've decided to break off the engagement.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.396
Why? She seems like a perfectly
admirable wife for a man with prospects.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.919
I think you, of all people,
must understand why it cannot be.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.959
Cannot be! How dramatic you are, Drummond.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.113
After Scotland, I feel it's only right.

09:36.800 --> 09:40.476
A successful politician
needs to have a wife.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.520
Now, you are going to be
a successful politician, Drummond,

09:44.680 --> 09:47.514
I know it. You're going to make
a difference in the world.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.957
But you can't throw that away
for some indiscretion.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.713
An indiscretion?

09:54.800 --> 09:57.440
I can't let you jeopardise your career.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.717
Surely that is for me to decide.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.712
You are not thinking clearly, Drummond.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.240
Gentlemen, your oysters.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.596
I find I am not hungry.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.598
One, two...

10:22.760 --> 10:25.036
What do you think, Lehzen?
Should I send for Sir James?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.157
Oh, Sir James!

10:28.240 --> 10:31.790
He'll just pull a long face
and prescribe calves' foot jelly.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.554
What the Princess needs
is some amusement in the fresh air.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.677
Yes, yes, I'm sure you're right.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.277
Why don't we take her
for a drive in the park, hm?

10:41.440 --> 10:44.035
Would you like that, darling?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.837
I am just on my way to a meeting.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.469
Then I will accompany you.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.918
A private... meeting.

11:02.080 --> 11:07.519
In Coburg, perhaps I should
not have spoken as I did.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.998
Oh, Penge, I wondered
if you could tell the kitchens

11:24.160 --> 11:26.629
that the Princess
will have bread and milk for her supper?

11:26.800 --> 11:30.840
Doesn't the Princess care
for pickled herring and sauerkraut?

11:31.920 --> 11:34.480
The Prince has some outlandish ideas
about diet.

11:34.640 --> 11:39.237
Hm. But in my experience,
he doesn't like to be challenged.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.790
The Queen and I are in full agreement.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.715
No doubt, Baroness, but it's never a good
idea to come between husband and wife.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.275
Come in.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.200
Your Royal Highness.

11:58.360 --> 12:02.274
I wanted to enquire as to how
the Repeal Bill was progressing.

12:02.440 --> 12:06.673
I have opened up a chasm
in my own party, Sir.

12:06.840 --> 12:09.958
- They accuse me of breaking my word.
- Oh.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.354
You and I are the same, I think.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.716
- Thin-skinned.
- Hm.

12:16.880 --> 12:21.113
After 30 years in the House,
I should be used to it.

12:21.280 --> 12:24.671
But I am no kind of host, Sir.
Would you care for a brandy?

12:26.480 --> 12:28.358
Thank you.

12:32.800 --> 12:37.033
Well, a toast, therefore,
to the thin-skinned.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.476
May we always be stout-hearted.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.671
Do you know, Sir Robert,

12:44.840 --> 12:49.517
when I first came to this country
I was so... disappointed.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.793
I could not understand how
in such a powerful nation,

12:53.960 --> 12:56.714
the politicians were so
determined to keep still,

12:56.880 --> 13:00.032
to deny the march of progress.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.789
Then I met you
and I realised my judgment had been...

13:07.480 --> 13:09.631
.. hasty.

13:09.800 --> 13:13.476
You must persevere.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.598
For this country's sake,
and also, I must say...

13:20.480 --> 13:22.278
For my own.

13:23.760 --> 13:27.037
I wish I had you beside me
on the front bench, Sir.

13:28.360 --> 13:31.910
Those damned rotten potatoes
are the cause of it all.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.869
I think Sir Robert is
doing the right thing.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.509
But, with respect, even your support

13:38.680 --> 13:43.755
won't keep that bounder George Bentinck
and his cronies off Peel's back.

13:43.920 --> 13:47.436
They would rather be out of power
for a generation

13:47.600 --> 13:51.310
than support the best leader
the Tory party's ever had.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.791
As Queen, I can do nothing,

13:54.960 --> 13:59.193
but you, Duke, you could talk to them.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.752
If they were my soldiers, I would have
them flogged for insubordination,

14:03.920 --> 14:05.957
but the party has no discipline.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.680
I'm afraid they will bring Peel down.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.116
You are too pessimistic, Duke.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.160
You don't win as many
battles as I have, Ma'am,

14:15.320 --> 14:18.313
by underestimating the enemy.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.995
Victoria, she does look rather flushed.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.311
I do think perhaps she has a fever.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.393
It is a healthy glow, Sir.
From the fresh air.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.671
Victoria, feel her head.

14:45.920 --> 14:50.233
She does feel a little
warm, but only a little.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.830
I'm sure she'll cool down
when she's had her bath.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.317
Well, I hope you are right.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.837
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Parliament.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.516
- To see Sir Robert?
- Well, I'm going to witness the debate.

15:06.680 --> 15:10.037
- I would like to lend him my support.
- Albert, is that wise?

15:10.200 --> 15:15.355
As you have so often reminded me, the Crown
must seem to be above party politics.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.830
Of course, but I am not the monarch.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.074
Also, I believe it my duty to stand behind
the man to whom I owe so much.

15:22.240 --> 15:24.994
If you go, they will assume
you are doing so at my request.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.230
I disagree.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.394
Just as I disagree with you and the
Baroness about the health of our daughter.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.553
- It is not the same.
- Yes, Victoria, it is.

15:33.720 --> 15:37.350
You think you are right in both instances.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.634
How can he be so objectionable?

15:43.800 --> 15:47.316
I believe that he knows you are right,
Majesty, but he does not care to admit it.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.997
- He's making a terrible mistake.
- I agree, Majesty.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.278
I should forbid him to go.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.319
Do you think you would succeed, Majesty?

15:59.480 --> 16:02.871
I've noticed that the Prince does
not always respect your authority.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.838
Most satisfactory.

16:08.640 --> 16:11.360
The mercury vapour is unpleasant,
I know, but it is effective.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.399
Yes, this is a very pleasing result.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.870
I hope that we do not meet again.

16:18.280 --> 16:22.877
I am... thinking of getting married.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.273
So long as you remain symptom-free,

16:26.440 --> 16:29.035
you may propose with a clear conscience.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.870
Oh, Mr Drummond, just the man I need.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.477
I wonder, could you direct me
to the Strangers' Gallery?

16:37.640 --> 16:41.316
- You are going to listen to the debate, Sir?
- Evidently.

16:41.480 --> 16:46.032
I ask you to remember
the terrible winters earlier in this decade

16:46.200 --> 16:50.160
when there was hardship
and suffering throughout the land.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.111
Are those winters effaced from your memory?

16:54.960 --> 16:56.838
From mine, they can never be.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.112
We must be ready for the season

17:05.280 --> 17:07.714
when famine comes again

17:07.880 --> 17:09.916
by abolishing the Corn Laws!

17:10.079 --> 17:13.471
Then at least we can be sure

17:13.640 --> 17:16.916
that when a black day comes,

17:17.079 --> 17:20.960
it will not have been aggravated
by the laws of man.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.320
The Honourable Member for Lincoln.

17:29.920 --> 17:35.200
Mr Speaker, is the Prime Minister
so frightened of the opposition

17:35.360 --> 17:37.113
within his own party

17:37.280 --> 17:41.240
that he feels the need
to summon a royal nursemaid

17:41.400 --> 17:44.199
to keep the ogres at bay?

18:08.520 --> 18:10.671
I am sure it is just a cold, Majesty.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.911
No need to worry.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.391
I hope you are right.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.080
At last! Where have you been?

18:20.240 --> 18:23.278
- Have you sent for Sir James?
- I couldn't find you anywhere.

18:23.440 --> 18:27.195
- She most definitely has a fever.
- Lehzen thinks it is just a cold.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.636
And you weren't here.

18:29.800 --> 18:35.000
If you do not send for Sir James immediately,
I cannot answer for the consequences.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.553
The Princess needs medical attention.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.996
Please send for Sir James at once.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.632
Now will you tell me, where have you been?

19:06.800 --> 19:10.271
You know, that woman...
she has bewitched you!

19:10.440 --> 19:13.512
- Did you go to the House?
- She is not fit to look after our children.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.990
- She was always most attentive to me.
- No, I know very well

19:16.160 --> 19:18.038
the Baroness never denied you anything.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.671
- That is why you enjoy her company so much.
- That is a hateful thing to say. Take it back!

19:21.840 --> 19:23.274
No! No, I will not!

19:23.440 --> 19:26.000
Baroness Lehzen has indulged you
your entire life!

19:26.160 --> 19:28.595
- She never checked your wilfulness.
- My wilfulness!

19:28.760 --> 19:33.118
There is a stubbornness in you that a
responsible guardian would have eradicated.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.637
My stubbornness?
Did you go to the House tonight or not?

19:38.040 --> 19:41.670
Baroness Lehzen was the only thing that
kept me from despair when I was growing up.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.309
You exaggerate, as usual.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.157
Do you know, I think the Baroness
tried to come between you and your mother,

19:48.320 --> 19:50.232
just as she is trying to
come between you and I.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.837
- That is a ridiculous suggestion.
- No, Victoria, it is not.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.754
So either she leaves or I do.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.514
But you are my husband.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.672
Exactly.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.353
I thought you left hours ago, sir.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.830
Lady Peel is in the country

20:22.000 --> 20:25.471
and I don't fancy bumping into Bentinck
and his cronies at the Carlton

20:25.640 --> 20:29.190
and hear them call the Prince my nursemaid.

20:30.320 --> 20:34.030
You will take care, won't you, Sir Robert?
Remember Spencer Percival.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.280
No-one will shoot me in
the House of Commons, Drummond.

20:37.920 --> 20:43.552
Bentinck wants his moment of glory,
not to swing from Albion's fatal tree.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.278
Very good.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.554
- Good day.
- Good morning, Sir.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.152
I hear there was no vote last night.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.959
No, Sir.

21:06.120 --> 21:09.955
The mood in the house after you left was...
rather ugly.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.473
But I believe the the division
bell will ring tonight.

21:14.480 --> 21:17.518
Lord Melbourne once told me
that the House of Commons

21:17.680 --> 21:20.593
would not take kindly to a German prince.

21:22.600 --> 21:27.391
We Members of Parliament are...
jealous of our independence, Sir.

21:28.600 --> 21:31.035
I apologise if I made things
more difficult for you.

21:33.160 --> 21:36.597
- That was not my intention.
- I know, Sir.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.038
Oh, I was just coming to find you.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.032
That's a coincidence, I
was looking for you.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.635
The Queen would like some beef tea
sent up to the nursery.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.759
Of course. I want to show you something.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.639
It's not the royal yacht, I know.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.360
But at least you won't
get seasick on the Serpentine.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.399
An afternoon away from all of this.
What do you say, Nancy?

22:02.360 --> 22:04.397
I say...

22:04.560 --> 22:06.279
yes, please.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.551
Congestion in the lungs?

22:14.720 --> 22:16.791
Is that dangerous?

22:16.960 --> 22:19.316
As I said to the Prince
earlier this morning,

22:19.480 --> 22:24.475
such a complication is always a concern
in a child of such a tender age.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.597
You have spoken to the Prince?

22:26.760 --> 22:29.355
Yes, Ma'am, only this morning.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.592
He asked me if the Princess's condition

22:32.760 --> 22:34.752
could have been caused by a draught.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.991
I see.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.479
And what did you say?

22:39.640 --> 22:41.472
Very difficult to say

22:41.640 --> 22:43.393
one way or the other.

22:43.560 --> 22:46.997
But for now,
our concern must be for the Princess.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.516
We must hope this fever breaks soon.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.672
And if it doesn't?

23:17.440 --> 23:19.432
Harriet!

23:21.120 --> 23:22.873
Try not to worry, Ma'am.

23:23.040 --> 23:26.112
These childhood fevers can seem
much worse than they really are.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.511
- It's my fault.
- No.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.751
I took her for a walk in the park

23:30.920 --> 23:33.310
because Lehzen thought
that she needed some fresh air.

23:33.480 --> 23:39.351
Now Albert blames Lehzen
and he says that she's coming between us.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.555
It can be very difficult

23:44.720 --> 23:47.872
to hold two people in your
heart at once, Ma'am.

23:59.240 --> 24:03.519
<i>"Drummond, I have been thinking
about our interrupted dinner."</i>

24:03.680 --> 24:05.751
<i>- Mr Drummond.
- "And whether it could be revived."</i>

24:05.920 --> 24:07.115
A message for you.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.478
<i>"I understand I have no right
to determine your future,"</i>

24:10.640 --> 24:14.873
<i>"but I think it would be a shame
if you never tasted the oysters at Ciros."</i>

24:16.320 --> 24:18.357
<i>"I will be there this evening."</i>

24:18.520 --> 24:20.671
<i>"Yours, Alfred."</i>

24:22.480 --> 24:24.437
It must be said, Mr Speaker,

24:24.600 --> 24:27.957
that the Prime Minister
is a man who has never failed

24:28.120 --> 24:30.954
to change his mind when
he found it expedient.

24:31.880 --> 24:36.955
A man without honour
or indeed any ideas of his own.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.760
A man who rejects his own party

24:39.920 --> 24:43.516
to bask in the glory of royal favour.

24:44.080 --> 24:48.916
And a man who is now turning his back
on the very landowners

24:49.080 --> 24:51.993
that have made this nation great!

24:52.160 --> 24:54.629
Sir, a moment.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.350
- I sent out the whips.
- Bentinck is a total blackguard!

25:00.520 --> 25:03.194
- I ought to call him out!
- I don't think a duel would be wise...

25:03.360 --> 25:04.635
He has insulted my honour!

25:04.800 --> 25:07.474
I may be a prime minister,
but I'm also a gentleman.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.393
No-one could doubt that, sir.

25:09.560 --> 25:14.077
But I fear such an action
would do nothing to advance your cause.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.512
Hm.

25:18.200 --> 25:22.080
You sound like my wife.
Lady Peel always tells me I'm too hasty.

25:22.240 --> 25:24.880
I trust Florence will keep you in order.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.396
This is my Calvary, Drummond.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.911
I hope I can bear it with grace.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.959
I know you will, sir.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.511
Harriet, there is something I need to...

25:43.680 --> 25:46.673
Erm... I must get back to the nursery.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.116
I couldn't wait any longer.

26:11.640 --> 26:16.874
Such a vulgar tune. I cannot understand
why it has become so popular.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.599
Oh, I thought you liked weddings.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.436
Only between the right people, Ernest.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.911
I will be delighted when
you marry Princess Gertrude...

26:28.920 --> 26:31.037
Then I'm afraid you will be disappointed.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.512
How's Vicky?

26:39.160 --> 26:42.517
I will go to the nursery to
see if I can help at all.

26:45.640 --> 26:49.554
I think your brother is about
to make a terrible mistake.

26:49.720 --> 26:53.555
At least he is honest about his desires.

26:53.720 --> 26:58.158
Even you must see the difference
between a private encounter

26:58.320 --> 27:00.471
and a public mesalliance.

27:00.640 --> 27:03.758
I can see the difference
between hypocrisy and truth.

27:03.920 --> 27:07.197
Oh, Albert, perhaps when you are older,

27:07.360 --> 27:12.071
you will understand that it is not
always necessary to be right.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.596
I trust you are returning to the nursery?

27:50.600 --> 27:53.240
My love. My love, my love.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.432
She is strong.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.317
Like her mother, she will not be beaten.

28:08.760 --> 28:10.353
Your hand?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.676
That is what happens
when I do not listen to you.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.991
We have both been stubborn.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.552
It doesn't matter now.

28:24.120 --> 28:28.717
I speak for the workers of this country,
who may not have votes

28:28.880 --> 28:34.035
but who deserve, nonetheless,
to buy untaxed food.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.919
Mr Speaker, I commend
this bill to the House.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.594
Hear hear!

28:40.760 --> 28:43.719
I move the Bill of Repeal onto the table.

28:43.880 --> 28:48.830
Those in favour to the right
and those not in favour to the left.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.830
Lock the doors!

29:30.200 --> 29:32.351
Ayes, 327.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.792
Noes, 229.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.111
The ayes have it.

29:39.280 --> 29:42.159
Unlock!

30:18.360 --> 30:20.397
Oh! Ha!

30:20.920 --> 30:22.912
The fever has broken!

30:42.760 --> 30:46.231
- God bless Sir Robert Peel!
- Hurrah!

30:46.400 --> 30:48.039
Thank you. Thank you.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.999
- Hurrah! Hurrah!
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.914
- Hurrah!
- Thank you.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.200
Are you sure I can't take you home?

31:00.360 --> 31:04.434
Thank you, sir, but, er...
I have an engagement.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.832
Thank you for stopping me
making a fool of myself over Bentinck.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.550
Thank you.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.792
Sir Robert Peel, prepare
to meet your maker!

31:18.880 --> 31:20.917
Drummond!

31:25.760 --> 31:28.480
Oh, God, talk to me! Drummond!

31:28.640 --> 31:31.235
Drummond, talk to me! Talk to me!

32:17.760 --> 32:20.036
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

32:20.200 --> 32:24.080
Vicky's fever
has broken, and, erm...

32:24.640 --> 32:26.677
Sir James thinks she will
make a full recovery.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.911
I am relieved to hear it, Ma'am.

32:29.080 --> 32:32.357
Why the grave faces, gentlemen?

32:34.240 --> 32:36.709
What is it, the bill?

32:36.880 --> 32:39.475
The bill passed last night by 98 votes.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.712
Oh, this is a great day, Sir Robert!

32:42.880 --> 32:45.520
It is the beginning
of a new era of enlightenment.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.869
Some lunatic took a shot at Peel last night
as he left the House.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.839
Drummond was with him and, er...

32:56.560 --> 32:58.552
.. he stopped the bullet.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.550
Dead?

33:02.560 --> 33:04.472
Why would anybody want to kill you?

33:04.640 --> 33:09.271
The erm... gunman was a farmer
who thought the Repeal Bill would ruin him.

33:10.600 --> 33:15.038
Will you excuse me, Ma'am?
I will go to Drummond's mother and fiancée.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.839
It must be me that tells them.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.151
Yes. Yes, of course.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.191
Oh, that poor girl.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.392
Letter for you, ma'am.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.358
Thank you.

33:47.840 --> 33:51.675
Lord Alfred, would you accompany me
to the amber drawing room?

33:51.840 --> 33:54.594
- I'm finding the stairs rather tricky.
- I can help you, Aunt.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.355
No, I want Lord Alfred.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.914
I hope you're feeling strong, Lord Alfred.

34:04.080 --> 34:07.198
Why, Duchess? Would you
like me to carry you?

34:07.360 --> 34:09.750
I'm afraid...

34:11.600 --> 34:13.989
You will find this very hard to bear.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.589
Take a deep breath.

34:25.760 --> 34:29.514
Now another one.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.079
Here, have some of this.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.478
I may be old but I'm not blind.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.757
I know what he meant to you.

34:44.920 --> 34:49.119
Now, I suggest you go to your room
and compose yourself.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.795
And remember...

34:51.960 --> 34:56.239
at the funeral, the chief mourners
will be his mother...

34:57.280 --> 34:59.272
.. and his fiancée.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.275
We are going with the Queen
to visit poor Mr Drummond's fiancée.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.236
The Queen is waiting.

35:20.760 --> 35:25.755
Would it be very wrong of me
to want to talk about happier things?

35:27.840 --> 35:30.071
There is something that I
would like to ask you.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.960
After dinner? The usual place.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.438
This is nice.

35:44.600 --> 35:48.116
Nothing to do except sit back
and watch you do all the work.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.715
That's the way it should always be.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.600
Are you offering to keep
me in the lap of luxury?

35:53.760 --> 35:57.834
A woman like you should be lying on a sofa
all day eating strawberry tarts.

36:00.040 --> 36:02.430
You do make very good tarts.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.718
I do make very good tarts.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.031
I think I need some shade.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.351
Would you like to come under my parasol?

36:21.840 --> 36:23.433
Your Majesty.

36:24.560 --> 36:29.157
I came to advise you that my government
will be defeated tonight on the Irish Bill.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.357
And when that happens,

36:31.520 --> 36:33.591
I have decided to resign.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.195
Sir Robert, are you sure?

36:36.360 --> 36:41.037
Now that the Repeal Bill is passed, Ma'am,
I feel my work is done. And...

36:41.200 --> 36:43.078
After Drummond, well...

36:47.760 --> 36:50.832
You have been a great prime minister.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.992
Thank you, Ma'am.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.559
Serving you has been a privilege.

36:55.720 --> 36:58.713
Even if it wasn't always very easy.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.793
But always... illuminating.

37:01.960 --> 37:04.714
I shall miss your counsel very much.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.758
You flatter me, Ma'am.

37:06.920 --> 37:10.709
I think we both know
that no-one is indispensable.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.475
Sir Robert, you are leaving?

37:34.640 --> 37:36.996
For the last time, Sir.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.472
"To every thing there is a season,

37:40.640 --> 37:43.838
and a time to every purpose under heaven."

37:44.600 --> 37:47.195
Well, I... I wish it was not time.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.356
Goodbye, Sir.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.118
Goodbye.

38:29.600 --> 38:33.150
What's the matter, Master Brodie?
Have you seen the mark of Cain?

38:33.320 --> 38:37.394
Actually it's more like a rash, Sir,
coppery in colour.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.353
Would you like me to get you a hand mirror,
so you can get a better look?

38:46.520 --> 38:49.991
No. No, I have seen quite enough.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.119
The Prince says to tell
you that he is sorry,

39:02.280 --> 39:04.715
but he is indisposed, Your Grace.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.596
"And Cinderella married Prince Charming

39:15.760 --> 39:18.355
and they lived happily ever after."

39:24.920 --> 39:27.435
She looks like herself again.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.273
Thank goodness.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.432
I was so worried.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.399
I did not doubt that she
would recover, Majesty.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.995
There is so much of you in her.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.280
But she looks like Albert.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.594
Lehzen.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.433
Majesty.

39:59.080 --> 40:01.117
I've been thinking.

40:02.440 --> 40:05.956
It's selfish of me, keeping
you here in England.

40:06.960 --> 40:09.350
Your family in Hanover
must miss you terribly.

40:09.520 --> 40:13.230
They have managed without me for 20 years.
I hardly remember them.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.675
Then think how happy they'll be
to see you again.

40:16.840 --> 40:19.071
I doubt they will recognise me.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.310
Lehzen...

40:26.480 --> 40:29.712
I have never wanted you to have to
choose between the Prince and me.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.272
When you got married,
I wondered if it was time for me to go,

40:34.440 --> 40:37.672
but somehow I could not find
the moment to leave.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.755
I thought you still needed me, you see.

40:43.120 --> 40:46.397
My loyalty has always been to you,
and only to you,

40:46.560 --> 40:48.756
not to Conroy, not to your mother.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.680
I have dedicated my life to protecting you.

40:52.840 --> 40:55.594
Lehzen, you don't need to protect me
from the Prince.

40:57.680 --> 41:01.356
He loves me... just as you do.

41:01.520 --> 41:04.194
My belief is that he would like to
control you, Majesty.

41:04.360 --> 41:07.319
Lehzen, it's because you have never been
married, you think of marriage

41:07.480 --> 41:11.918
as a battle... where one side
has to achieve victory over the other.

41:12.080 --> 41:14.595
The Prince and I, we have our differences.

41:18.960 --> 41:23.000
- But we're on the same side.
- I'm glad to hear that, Majesty.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.916
In that case, I will make
the necessary arrangements.

41:37.680 --> 41:41.754
The only thing that I have ever wanted
is your happiness, Majesty.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.910
You must know, Lehzen...

41:49.480 --> 41:51.551
For many years...

41:54.120 --> 41:55.918
.. you were everything to me.

41:59.080 --> 42:03.791
Do you remember how you held my hand when
we walked down the stairs at Kensington?

42:03.960 --> 42:06.316
I never wanted you to fall.

42:08.640 --> 42:10.632
I never did.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.513
Oh, Lehzen.

42:20.760 --> 42:23.070
I will miss you so much.

42:36.240 --> 42:40.519
Cut down in the flower of his youth,

42:40.680 --> 42:45.755
we come here today to mourn
the passing of Edward Drummond.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.719
A man who had already achieved so much.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.796
A devoted son.

42:52.440 --> 42:56.992
A man who only next month
was to be married in this very church.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.515
Florence, this is Lord Alfred.

43:12.680 --> 43:13.955
Lord Alfred.

43:14.920 --> 43:18.197
Edward spoke about you so often.

43:20.400 --> 43:23.518
You both liked those awful cheroots.

43:24.440 --> 43:26.238
Well, we...

43:26.400 --> 43:28.392
We shared some bad habits.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.878
He... he will...

44:07.720 --> 44:10.633
I trust the carriage is to
your satisfaction, Baroness?

44:11.960 --> 44:13.553
Yes, Mr Penge.

44:15.680 --> 44:18.673
I have brought you
something for the journey.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.072
I will miss you, Mr Penge.

45:33.480 --> 45:36.552
- Good boy. That's right.
- Mama, mama.

45:36.720 --> 45:40.077
- Look what Uncle Leopold brought!
- Oh!

45:42.400 --> 45:44.790
Uncle Leopold is...

45:44.960 --> 45:49.716
- Very kind.
- I would do anything for my family.

45:52.520 --> 45:54.193
I know.

45:55.600 --> 45:57.000
A ride, a ride!

45:57.160 --> 46:00.198
Oh, come on, Vicky, this is Herbert.

46:00.360 --> 46:03.239
- This is Herbert.
- Say hello to Herbert.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.874
- Hello, Herbert.
- Good, good.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.872
Bertie!

46:13.040 --> 46:14.838
Hello, Herbert.
