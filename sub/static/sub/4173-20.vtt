Ooh! I've got to go
and thank the boys.

09:57.697 --> 10:02.334
<i>Oh, Norm, your performance
exceeded my previous computations.</i>

10:02.336 --> 10:04.469
I just had to get
out of my own head.

10:04.471 --> 10:07.572
Well, what a phenomenal
finale to our finale.

10:07.574 --> 10:10.442
Congratulations and kudos
to our two winners!

10:10.444 --> 10:12.844
And there wasn't even a contest!
(CHUCKLES)

10:13.179 --> 10:15.780
Wow! You were
smoothtastic.

10:16.248 --> 10:18.416
Are you gonna introduce
me to your new girl?

10:18.418 --> 10:20.452
<i>Why, yes! Of course.</i>
<i>This is...</i>

10:20.454 --> 10:22.487
Chloe! What are
you doing?

10:22.489 --> 10:25.290
Rodney! Wait, wait, wait.
This is your robot?

10:25.292 --> 10:29.294
Come, Chloe. Let's get you
away from this rusted Romeo!

10:29.296 --> 10:29.847
Oh, yeah?

10:29.896 --> 10:33.465
(STAMMERS) Well, I'm too flustered
to come up with an insult.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.667
So I'll call you later
and give it to you then.

10:35.669 --> 10:36.768
Come on, Norm.

10:36.770 --> 10:40.872
<i>Goodbye, Chloe. Parting
is such sweet sorrow.</i>

10:41.340 --> 10:43.642
<i>That is a reference</i>
<i>from </i> Romeo and Juliet.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.478
<i>So, I shall say, "Good night</i>
<i>till it be 'morrow."</i>

10:46.480 --> 10:49.347
See, you don't need her, Norm.
She's a know-it-all. Ugh!

10:49.349 --> 10:50.582
Ooh, look! Corndogs!

10:50.584 --> 10:53.618
Boys, are you here?
I just wanted to say...

10:53.620 --> 10:57.856
(GASPS) Phineas! Ferb!
You are so busted!

10:57.858 --> 11:00.925
What? Get out of the way!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

11:01.327 --> 11:03.928
Did I hear you just bust
Phineas and Ferb?

11:03.930 --> 11:04.910
I certainly did!

11:04.930 --> 11:07.499
(MANIACAL GIGGLING) What are all my
good guest towels doing out here?

11:07.501 --> 11:08.867
And they're filthy!
Towels?

11:08.869 --> 11:11.202
Oh! Sorry, Mom. We'll clean 'em up.
Towels?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.537
Yeah. You get
right on that.

11:12.539 --> 11:13.872
And when you're done
we'll have beignets.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.240
So, let me
get this straight.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.208
After everything they've
done this summer,

11:17.210 --> 11:19.744
you decide to yell at them
for a few dirty towels?

11:19.746 --> 11:20.848
Isn't that enough?

11:20.946 --> 11:23.247
Way to make a mockery
of my lifetime goal, Mom.

11:23.315 --> 11:24.582
Towels.
