00:31.200 --> 00:36.915
Human beings venture into the highest
parts of our planet at their peril.

00:37.499 --> 00:40.461
Some might think that
by climbing a great mountain

00:40.544 --> 00:42.380
they have somehow conquered it,

00:42.797 --> 00:46.009
but we can only be visitors here.

00:48.470 --> 00:52.725
This is a frozen alien world.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.867
This is the other extreme -

01:06.950 --> 01:11.080
one of the lowest hottest places
on Earth.

01:17.754 --> 01:21.675
It's over a hundred meters
below the level of the sea.

01:21.801 --> 01:25.138
But here a mountain is in gestation.

01:25.263 --> 01:28.266
Pools of sulphuric acid are indications

01:28.350 --> 01:33.189
that deep underground
there are titanic stirrings.

01:38.779 --> 01:42.283
This is the Danakil Depression
in Ethiopia,

01:42.408 --> 01:45.411
lying within a colossal rent
of the earth's surface

01:45.495 --> 01:49.541
where giant land masses
are pulling away from one another.

01:52.128 --> 01:56.174
Lava rises to the surface
through this crack in the crust

01:56.257 --> 01:59.219
creating a chain of young volcanoes.

02:11.233 --> 02:13.402
This one, Erta Ale,

02:13.486 --> 02:18.533
is today the longest continually
erupting volcano on the planet,

02:18.617 --> 02:23.456
a lake of lava that has been
molten for over a hundred years.

02:34.761 --> 02:41.894
These same volcanic forces
also created Ethiopia's highlands.

02:47.943 --> 02:49.945
70 million years ago

02:50.028 --> 02:52.990
this land was just as flat and as deep

02:53.074 --> 02:55.076
as the Danakil Depression.

02:57.370 --> 03:00.666
Molten lava rising
from the earth's core

03:00.749 --> 03:05.254
forced up a huge dome
of rock 500 miles wide,

03:05.291 --> 03:07.382
the roof of Africa.

03:14.056 --> 03:17.519
Over millennia,
rain and ice carved the rock

03:17.602 --> 03:20.898
into a landscape
of spires and canyons.

03:27.739 --> 03:30.284
These summits, nearly 3 miles up,

03:30.367 --> 03:34.664
are home to some very
remarkable mountaineers -

03:34.997 --> 03:37.375
Gelada baboons.

03:37.459 --> 03:41.463
They are unique
to the highlands of Ethiopia.

03:55.521 --> 03:59.609
The cliffs where they sleep
are for expert climbers only,

03:59.693 --> 04:02.529
and Gelado certainly have
the right equipment.

04:02.613 --> 04:04.865
The strongest fingers
of any primate

04:04.949 --> 04:07.786
and an utterly fearless disposition.

04:10.706 --> 04:14.919
But you need more than a head
for heights to survive up here.

04:15.044 --> 04:20.759
A day in a Gelado's life reveals
how they've risen to the challenge.

04:34.066 --> 04:37.612
For all monkeys morning is grooming time,

04:37.737 --> 04:40.741
a chance to catch up with friends.

04:41.325 --> 04:43.327
But, unlike other monkeys,

04:43.452 --> 04:46.914
Gelados chatter constantly
while they do it.

04:48.625 --> 04:52.629
It's a great way to network
while your hands are busy.

04:53.255 --> 04:56.884
But these socials can't go on
for too long.

04:56.968 --> 04:59.638
Gelados have a busy daily schedule

04:59.721 --> 05:01.556
and there's work to be done.

05:06.020 --> 05:08.565
Most monkeys couldn't live up here.

05:08.648 --> 05:11.401
There's no food
and few insects to feed on.

05:11.526 --> 05:13.320
But Gelados are unique -

05:13.445 --> 05:18.409
they're the only monkeys in the world
that live almost entirely on grass.

05:29.756 --> 05:33.677
They live in the largest assemblies
formed by any monkeys.

05:33.761 --> 05:36.013
Some groups are 800 strong

05:36.097 --> 05:40.101
and they crop the high meadows
like herds of wildebeest.

05:52.741 --> 05:56.162
The Gelados graze
alongside Walia ibex,

05:56.245 --> 05:59.290
which are also unique
to these highlands.

06:03.462 --> 06:06.424
These rare creatures
are usually very shy

06:06.549 --> 06:10.512
but they drop their guard
when the Gelados are around.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.020
You might expect that grazers
would avoid each other's patch

06:18.146 --> 06:22.567
but this is a special alliance
from which both partners benefit.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.113
It's not so risky
to put your head down

06:26.238 --> 06:28.282
if others are on the lookout.

06:30.452 --> 06:32.454
Ethiopian wolves -

06:32.537 --> 06:35.791
they won't attempt an attack
in broad daylight.

06:39.879 --> 06:44.677
But at dusk the plateau becomes
a more dangerous place.

06:47.889 --> 06:50.016
With the grazing largely over

06:50.183 --> 06:55.064
there's a last chance to socialize
before returning to the sleeping cliffs.

07:14.169 --> 07:18.132
An early warning system
puts everyone on the alert.

08:10.818 --> 08:15.657
Their day ends as it began,
safe on the steep cliffs.

08:23.416 --> 08:26.337
The Ethiopian volcanoes are dormant,

08:26.420 --> 08:30.383
but elsewhere others still rage.

08:43.356 --> 08:48.320
Volcanoes form the backbone
of the longest mountain chain on our planet -

08:48.404 --> 08:50.782
the Andes of South America.

08:51.991 --> 08:59.125
This vast range stretches 5,000 miles
from the Equator down to the Antarctic.

09:00.543 --> 09:03.296
It formed as the floor of the Pacific Ocean

09:03.380 --> 09:08.052
slid beneath the South American
continent, buckling its edge.

09:19.523 --> 09:24.362
At the southern end
stand the mountains of Patagonia.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.159
It's high summer,

09:33.707 --> 09:38.379
but the Andes have the most
unstable mountain weather on the planet

09:38.462 --> 09:41.758
and storms can erupt without warning.

09:43.343 --> 09:44.678
Temperatures plummet

09:44.761 --> 09:50.101
and guanacos and their newborn young
must suddenly endure a blizzard.

10:03.700 --> 10:07.413
Truly, all seasons in one day...

10:19.552 --> 10:20.636
A puma -

10:20.761 --> 10:23.056
the lion of the Andes.

10:29.480 --> 10:33.485
Pumas are usually solitary and secretive.

10:33.568 --> 10:39.325
To see a group walking boldly
in the open is extremely rare.

10:50.504 --> 10:54.593
It's a family -
a mother with four cubs.

10:54.843 --> 10:57.471
She has just one brief summer

10:57.596 --> 11:01.601
in which to teach them
their mountain survival techniques.

11:14.658 --> 11:19.663
Rearing four cubs to this age
is an exceptional feat,

11:19.747 --> 11:22.166
but she does have
an excellent territory,

11:22.291 --> 11:24.669
rich in food and water.

11:28.298 --> 11:30.968
Although the cubs are now
as large as their mother,

11:31.093 --> 11:34.013
they still rely
on her for their food.

12:58.820 --> 13:04.661
It will be another year
before the cubs can hunt for themselves.

13:15.590 --> 13:18.552
Without their mother's
skill and experience

13:18.677 --> 13:21.472
they would never survive
their first winter.

13:42.037 --> 13:44.791
Battered by hurricane force winds,

13:44.916 --> 13:47.919
these slopes are now lifeless.

13:51.215 --> 13:54.886
Further north,
they hold other dangers.

14:26.339 --> 14:29.593
Moving at 250 miles an hour,

14:29.676 --> 14:33.556
an avalanche destroys
everything in its path.

14:54.163 --> 14:56.249
In the American Rockies

14:56.332 --> 15:01.255
a 100,000 avalanches devastate
the slopes every winter.

15:04.342 --> 15:08.930
This huge mountain chain
continues the great spine

15:09.014 --> 15:12.601
that runs from Patagonia to Alaska.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.543
The slopes of the Rockies,
bleak though they are,

15:34.627 --> 15:38.506
provide a winter refuge
for some animals.

15:41.260 --> 15:44.055
A mother grizzly emerges
from her den

15:44.180 --> 15:47.475
after six months'
dozing underground.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.311
Her two cubs follow her

15:49.436 --> 15:53.023
and take their first steps
in the outside world.

16:07.290 --> 16:10.836
These steep slopes provide
a sanctuary for the cubs.

16:10.961 --> 16:14.590
A male bear would kill
and eat them given the chance.

16:15.091 --> 16:18.386
But big animals find it difficult
to get about here.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.181
Males may be twice
the size of a female

16:21.306 --> 16:23.601
and even she
can have problems.

16:38.159 --> 16:41.830
Her cubs, however,
make light of the snow

16:41.914 --> 16:43.832
and of life in general.

16:57.557 --> 17:00.185
But the mother faces a dilemma:

17:00.268 --> 17:03.105
It's six months
since she last fed

17:03.188 --> 17:06.150
and her milk is starting
to run dry.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.863
She must soon leave the safety
of these nursery slopes

17:09.945 --> 17:12.825
and lead her cubs away
from the mountain.

17:13.325 --> 17:18.414
If she delays,
the whole family will risk starvation.

17:46.113 --> 17:50.493
Summer reveals the true nature
of the Rockies.

17:58.753 --> 18:00.338
Stripped of snow,

18:00.463 --> 18:04.134
the peaks bear their sculpted forms.

18:06.929 --> 18:11.226
Only now can mountaineers
reclaim the upper reaches.

18:42.262 --> 18:48.519
Two miles up the crumbling precipices
seem devoid of life.

18:58.114 --> 19:01.409
But there are animals here -

19:20.849 --> 19:22.684
a grizzly bear.

19:22.809 --> 19:27.690
It seems to be an odd creature
to find on these high rocky slopes.

19:31.069 --> 19:34.907
It's hard to imagine
what could have attracted it here.

19:50.466 --> 19:55.347
At this time of the year
bears should be fattening up for the winter.

19:55.431 --> 20:00.478
Yet they gather in some numbers
on these apparently barren slopes.

20:12.784 --> 20:16.872
They're searching
for a rather unusual food -

20:18.457 --> 20:19.751
moths.

20:19.917 --> 20:23.463
Millions have flown up here
to escape the heat of the lowlands

20:23.547 --> 20:26.300
and they're now roosting
among the rocks.

20:29.554 --> 20:32.974
Moths may seem
a meager meal for a bear,

20:33.099 --> 20:34.935
but their bodies are rich in fat

20:35.018 --> 20:39.732
and can make all the difference
in a bear's annual struggle for survival.

20:43.028 --> 20:45.739
Another battle is being waged here

20:45.823 --> 20:48.784
but on a much longer timescale.

20:48.868 --> 20:53.331
These loose boulders are
the mountain's crumbling bones.

20:53.415 --> 20:55.667
The Rockies are no longer rising

20:55.834 --> 20:58.587
but slowly disintegrating.

21:03.468 --> 21:10.059
All mountains everywhere are being
worn down by frost, snow and ice.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.862
The Alps were raised
some 15 million years ago

21:19.946 --> 21:25.327
as Africa, drifting northwards,
collided with the southern edge of Europe.

21:31.084 --> 21:35.255
These spires are the eroded
remains of an ancient seabed

21:35.339 --> 21:39.176
that once stretched
between the two continents.

21:56.238 --> 22:00.076
But these are just
the Alpine foothills.

22:00.201 --> 22:04.456
The range at its center
rises to 3 miles high

22:04.581 --> 22:08.127
and is crowned
with permanent snows.

22:21.476 --> 22:22.685
The Matterhorn,

22:22.769 --> 22:26.523
its summit too steep
to hold a snow field.

22:35.283 --> 22:39.622
Mont Blanc - the highest peak
in Western Europe.

22:52.845 --> 22:56.183
The distinctive jagged shapes
of the Alps

22:56.308 --> 22:59.770
were carved
by those great mountain sculptors -

22:59.895 --> 23:01.522
the glaciers.

23:07.613 --> 23:10.324
Immense rivers of moving ice,

23:10.408 --> 23:11.784
laden with rock,

23:11.868 --> 23:14.287
grind their way
down the mountains,

23:14.371 --> 23:17.165
gouging out deep valleys.

23:23.715 --> 23:28.470
They're the most powerful erosive force
on our planet.

23:36.563 --> 23:40.568
A moulin - a shaft in the ice
opened by melt water

23:40.651 --> 23:44.155
as it plunges
into the depths of the glacier.

23:59.924 --> 24:01.550
Like the water running through it,

24:01.634 --> 24:04.304
the ice itself is constantly moving,

24:04.387 --> 24:08.141
flowing down the valley
with unstoppable force.

24:27.247 --> 24:29.875
Alpine glaciers may seem immense,

24:29.959 --> 24:32.837
but they're dwarfed by those in the great ranges

24:32.920 --> 24:36.383
that divide the Indian
subcontinent from Tibet.

24:40.888 --> 24:43.599
This is the boulder strewn snout

24:43.683 --> 24:49.565
of the giant Baltoro glacier
in the Karakoram mountains of Pakistan.

24:58.784 --> 25:01.954
It's the biggest mountain glacier
on Earth -

25:02.038 --> 25:06.042
43 miles long and over 3 miles wide.

25:06.167 --> 25:09.671
This huge ice-filled valley
is so large

25:09.755 --> 25:12.341
it's clearly visible from space.

25:35.618 --> 25:40.207
This is the greatest concentration
of peaks over 5 miles high

25:40.290 --> 25:43.002
to be found anywhere on Earth.

25:45.964 --> 25:49.217
They're the most
dangerous mountains of all.

25:49.301 --> 25:55.350
K2 and her sister peaks
have claimed more lives than any others.

26:06.863 --> 26:10.075
The peaks here rise so precipitously,

26:10.159 --> 26:12.912
the glaciers are so steep and crevassed

26:12.995 --> 26:18.210
that few except the most skilled
mountaineers can penetrate these ranges.

26:21.714 --> 26:25.301
Markhor gather
for their annual rut.

26:38.024 --> 26:41.070
Males must fight
for the right to breed,

26:41.153 --> 26:46.159
but on these sheer cliffs
any slip by either animal could be fatal.

26:57.714 --> 26:59.007
A snow leopard -

26:59.132 --> 27:01.677
the rarest of Himalayan animals.

27:02.803 --> 27:06.015
It's a female returning to her lair.

27:16.986 --> 27:23.202
These are the first intimate images
of snow leopard ever filmed in the wild.

27:33.088 --> 27:36.175
She greets her one year old cub.

27:40.597 --> 27:42.933
Her den is well chosen.

27:43.058 --> 27:46.938
It has exceptional views
of the surrounding cliffs.

27:50.275 --> 27:52.486
On these treacherous slopes

27:52.569 --> 27:55.156
no hunter other
than the snow leopard

27:55.239 --> 27:58.702
would have a chance
of catching such fragile prey.

28:05.877 --> 28:09.548
A female with young
makes an easier target.

28:28.862 --> 28:31.990
Her large paws give
an excellent grip

28:32.074 --> 28:35.620
and that long tail
helps her balance.

28:44.880 --> 28:49.678
Silently she positions herself
above her prey.

29:52.376 --> 29:55.546
She returns with nothing.

30:26.624 --> 30:32.464
Golden eagles patrol these cliffs
in search of the weak or injured.

30:52.904 --> 30:55.115
With a 2 meter wing span

30:55.199 --> 30:58.494
this bird could easily
take a young markhor.

31:02.374 --> 31:04.209
Eagles hunt by sight

31:04.334 --> 31:08.714
and the thickening veil
of snow forces them to give up.

31:24.858 --> 31:27.945
For the leopard
the snow provides cover

31:28.029 --> 31:30.406
and creates an opportunity.

31:48.970 --> 31:53.058
The worsening weather dampens
the sound of her approach

31:53.183 --> 31:57.271
allowing her to get
within striking distance.

32:14.708 --> 32:16.752
It was an act of desperation

32:16.835 --> 32:19.672
to try and catch such a large animal.

32:29.225 --> 32:31.269
Wolves have made a kill

32:31.394 --> 32:35.065
giving other hunters
a chance to scavenge.

32:51.292 --> 32:55.047
The worst of the blizzard brings
success for the snow leopard,

32:55.172 --> 32:57.883
but having descended so far
to make the kill

32:58.008 --> 33:02.138
she has a grueling climb
to get back to her lair.

33:16.405 --> 33:18.491
The cub must be patient.

33:18.616 --> 33:21.286
It'll be a year
before it has the strength and skill

33:21.411 --> 33:25.457
to kill for itself
on these difficult slopes.

33:50.611 --> 33:54.324
The snow leopard is
an almost mythical creature,

33:54.407 --> 33:56.243
an icon of the wilderness,

33:56.326 --> 33:59.497
an animal few humans
have ever glimpsed

33:59.580 --> 34:03.126
for its world is
one we seldom visit.

34:11.177 --> 34:14.472
The Karakoram lie
at the western end of a range

34:14.556 --> 34:18.643
that stretches
across a tenth of our planet -

34:18.978 --> 34:21.063
the Himalayas.

34:31.159 --> 34:34.120
These, the highest mountains
of the world,

34:34.204 --> 34:36.290
like other great ranges,

34:36.373 --> 34:40.418
were created by the collision
of continents.

34:41.629 --> 34:44.049
Some 50 million years ago

34:44.132 --> 34:46.176
India collided with Tibet

34:46.301 --> 34:50.973
thrusting up these immense peaks,
which are still rising.

34:56.228 --> 34:59.692
This vast barrier
of rock and ice

34:59.817 --> 35:04.114
is so colossal
it shapes the world's climate.

35:05.699 --> 35:08.786
Warm winds from India,
full of moisture,

35:08.869 --> 35:11.330
are forced upwards
by the Himalayas.

35:11.455 --> 35:14.042
As the air rises so it cools,

35:14.125 --> 35:16.253
causing clouds to form

35:16.336 --> 35:19.006
and the monsoon is born.

35:57.676 --> 36:02.431
At high altitudes
the monsoon rains fall as snow.

36:03.266 --> 36:06.686
Here, at the far eastern end
of the range in China,

36:06.770 --> 36:11.859
one inhabitant endures
the bitter winters out in the open.

36:19.159 --> 36:23.331
Most other bears would be
sleeping underground by now,

36:23.456 --> 36:28.420
but the giant panda can't
fatten up enough to hibernate.

36:31.048 --> 36:35.261
Its food, bamboo, on which it totally relies

36:35.345 --> 36:38.265
has so little nutritional value

36:38.348 --> 36:42.562
that it can't build up
a store of fat like other bears.

36:43.771 --> 36:48.694
Most of the creatures here move up or down
the slopes with the seasons

36:48.777 --> 36:51.822
but the panda is held
captive by its diet

36:51.906 --> 36:56.828
for the kind of bamboo it eats
only grows at this altitude.

37:03.961 --> 37:09.635
But these forests hold
fewer challenges for the more mobile.

37:12.388 --> 37:19.229
The golden snap-nosed monkey,
like the giant panda, lives only in China.

37:21.315 --> 37:26.655
Their thick fur allows them to survive
at greater altitudes than any other monkey

37:26.738 --> 37:31.660
and when the cold bites
they have these upper slopes to themselves.

37:39.378 --> 37:41.380
Even if you have a warm coat

37:41.463 --> 37:46.302
it apparently helps to surround yourself
with as many layers as possible.

37:48.430 --> 37:50.891
But at least these monkeys
have a choice -

37:50.975 --> 37:54.395
if they tire of tree bark
and other survival food

37:54.520 --> 37:57.941
they can always descend
to lower warmer altitudes

37:58.024 --> 38:00.277
and not return there till spring.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.951
As the snows retreat

38:07.077 --> 38:09.621
trees come into bloom.

38:15.753 --> 38:17.130
Cherry blossom.

38:20.300 --> 38:21.719
Rhododendrons -

38:21.802 --> 38:25.264
here in their natural home
they form great forests

38:25.348 --> 38:29.186
and fill the landscape
with the covers of a new season.

38:48.959 --> 38:54.882
These forests are a host
to a rich variety of springtime migrants.

39:09.733 --> 39:13.237
Beneath the blooms - another display.

39:16.407 --> 39:19.828
It's the mating season
for oriental pheasants,

39:19.953 --> 39:21.789
Himalayan monal,

39:25.668 --> 39:27.170
tragopan

39:27.295 --> 39:29.172
and blood pheasant.

39:37.557 --> 39:42.646
Musk deer make the most
of a short flash of spring foods.

39:44.398 --> 39:48.153
This male smells a potential mate.

40:03.754 --> 40:07.467
The red panda,
rarely glimpsed in the wild.

40:07.550 --> 40:10.011
It was once considered
a kind of raccoon,

40:10.095 --> 40:13.557
but is now believed
to be a small mountain bear.

40:24.737 --> 40:31.536
By midsummer its larger, more famous
relative, has retreated into a cave.

40:45.469 --> 40:51.101
A giant panda nurses
a tiny week old baby.

40:57.692 --> 41:01.780
Her tender cleaning
wards off infection.

41:13.419 --> 41:17.423
She won't leave this cave
for three weeks,

41:19.259 --> 41:23.180
not while her cub
is so utterly helpless.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.193
Progress is slow

41:34.318 --> 41:39.741
for milk produced on a diet
of bamboo is wretchedly poor.

41:46.624 --> 41:48.209
Four weeks old

41:48.334 --> 41:50.921
and the cub is still blind.

41:59.305 --> 42:05.229
Its eyes do not fully open
until three months after birth,

42:05.354 --> 42:10.276
but the chances of the cub
reaching adulthood are slim.

42:14.573 --> 42:18.369
The struggle of a giant panda
mother to raise her cub

42:18.494 --> 42:24.543
is a touching symbol of the precariousness
of life in the mountains.

42:34.722 --> 42:37.683
On the highest summits
of our planet

42:37.808 --> 42:40.437
nothing can live permanently.

42:45.025 --> 42:46.736
The highest peak of all,

42:46.819 --> 42:50.949
Mount Everest, five and a half
miles above sea level

42:51.032 --> 42:55.245
and still rising -
the roof of our world.

42:56.872 --> 42:59.709
Of those humans who've tried to climb it

42:59.792 --> 43:02.879
one in ten have lost their lives.

43:03.046 --> 43:08.886
Those that succeed can stand
for only a few moments on its summit.

43:09.011 --> 43:15.102
The Nepalese call it 'a mountain
so high no bird can fly above it.'

43:21.818 --> 43:26.699
But each year
over 50,000 demoiselle cranes

43:26.782 --> 43:31.246
set out on one of the most
challenging migrations on Earth.

43:33.457 --> 43:36.877
To reach their overwintering
grounds in India

43:37.002 --> 43:40.089
they must cross the Himalayas.

43:46.931 --> 43:51.311
By late morning ferocious winds
are roaring past the peaks.

43:51.436 --> 43:55.899
The cranes must gain height
to avoid the building storm.

44:25.517 --> 44:28.479
They've hit serious turbulence.

44:33.151 --> 44:34.861
They must turn back

44:34.987 --> 44:36.947
or risk death.

45:12.405 --> 45:13.949
A new day

45:14.074 --> 45:16.535
and a new opportunity.

45:17.661 --> 45:22.083
The flock stay in close contact
by calling one another.

45:31.552 --> 45:33.847
Weak from lack of food and water,

45:33.930 --> 45:39.019
they use thermals, rising columns
of warm air, to gain height.

45:56.665 --> 46:01.838
For many this is their first journey
across the Himalayas.

46:01.963 --> 46:05.300
For some, it will be their last.

46:13.977 --> 46:17.398
The golden eagles
have been expecting them.

46:28.243 --> 46:33.792
The eagles work in pairs
to separate a young crane from the flock.

47:20.346 --> 47:22.807
It escapes the touches of one,

47:22.974 --> 47:24.976
and is caught by another.

47:28.147 --> 47:31.734
But even a young crane
is a heavy prize

47:31.859 --> 47:35.739
and the eagle has
to struggle to control it.

47:55.095 --> 47:57.097
The mother can wait no longer -

47:57.180 --> 48:01.352
this is a desperate race
against worsening weather.

48:07.943 --> 48:10.863
The rest of the flock
battle on.

48:15.160 --> 48:20.875
In the ascent every wing beat
becomes an exhausting struggle.

48:39.563 --> 48:45.403
At last they are over the highest
barrier that lies in their way.

48:52.787 --> 48:56.875
But like all who visit
the world of the high mountains

48:57.000 --> 48:59.253
they dare not linger.
