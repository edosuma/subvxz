<i>Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's a few
things you might need to know.</i>

00:04.200 --> 00:06.000
<i>SARAH:
You're not the same guy
that I fell for.</i>

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
How am I not the same guy?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.100
You killed somebody, Chuck.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.900
He didn't kill the mole.
What?

00:11.200 --> 00:13.400
<i>I did.
It's time you learned the truth</i>

00:13.400 --> 00:14.800
about your
wife's murder.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.700
No!

00:17.700 --> 00:20.100
If the Ring
<i>played him this video...</i>

00:20.200 --> 00:21.900
Oh, my God, General,
where is Sarah now?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.600
I believe she's with Agent Shaw.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.100
Daniel, where are
you taking us?

00:27.300 --> 00:28.500
To settle an old score.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.800
Okay, just give me 20 seconds.
Are you sure about this?

00:50.800 --> 00:52.500
NSA picked up
the Director's signal.

00:52.700 --> 00:54.100
This is his
broadcast point.

00:55.000 --> 00:55.900
If they're right, Sarah,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
the Ring's most senior operative
is behind that door.

01:04.000 --> 01:04.800
Cover me.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.600
Hey, buddy.
Hey.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.000
Hey, hey, buddy.
Where's Casey?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Haven't seen him.
I have been thinking

01:13.000 --> 01:14.700
about this whole unofficial
member of Operation Bartowski

01:14.700 --> 01:16.000
and I'd like
to make it official.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.100
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of
in the middle of something...
Spyish?

01:18.100 --> 01:19.600
I know. That's my point,
dude. Let me help.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.000
I want to be
part of the team.
Okay, fine.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.500
Help me find Casey
and you're part of the team.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.200
Operation Bartowski?
I could actually...

01:25.000 --> 01:26.700
Not so loud.
Not so loud, right.

01:26.700 --> 01:27.600
It's just great
news, you know,

01:27.600 --> 01:30.000
because, listen, I could be
your second in command
slash personal assistant.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.200
Batman needs Alfred.

01:31.200 --> 01:31.800
Bond needs Q.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.300
Chuck-- hey, hey, hey.
You need me.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.600
Morgan, I need Casey right now.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.800
Well, Chuck, per my excellent
peripheral vision--

01:38.000 --> 01:39.600
which is a valuable spy skill
I might add--

01:39.600 --> 01:42.600
I can tell you that
one John Casey is
now exiting the restroom.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.900
Oh, thank you. Great.
You're welcome.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.200
So I'm a spy?
That's it? Official?

01:48.200 --> 01:49.400
Yes, you're a spy. Gotta go.

01:50.000 --> 01:50.900
I am a spy.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.400
Shaw?

02:03.600 --> 02:05.500
Walker killed Shaw's wife?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.800
It was five years ago.
It was her Red Test.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.600
Sarah didn't know.
Beckman didn't know, but Shaw,
he knows.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.000
Now, he and Sarah have
disappeared on some mission.
They're off the grid.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.800
They can't be raised.
They're gone.
Chuck, I'm not an agent.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.100
You shouldn't be
telling me any of this.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.700
But you know what to do, Casey.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.400
Okay, Beckman told me
to just sit tight.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.600
You and I know
I can't do that.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.800
Sarah just activated
her locator.

02:24.800 --> 02:25.800
She's in trouble.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.200
Come on, man!

02:28.200 --> 02:29.600
You know how I feel about her.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.500
Call this number.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.700
Request Tactical Support.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.700
You'll be forwarded
to a Colonel Sanders.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.400
Don't make fun of his name.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.700
You want air,
armor-- everything.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.300
...video camera
for your birthday.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.300
I had no idea you were
going to use my present
against me.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.000
Happy birthday.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.800
I love you.

03:15.700 --> 03:16.700
Oh, my God.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.800
I love you.

03:43.100 --> 03:45.000
All right, one more time,
just so we're clear.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.600
We have to reacquire
Agent Walker.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.000
Nothing can happen to her.
Do I make myself clear?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.100
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.700
This is Team Leader.
Is everything set?

03:53.000 --> 03:53.800
Air is go.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.900
Mechanized is go.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.000
Tactical is go.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.200
Airborne is go.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.200
All right, boys,
let's do this.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.300
Shaw.

04:26.000 --> 04:26.900
I'm going first.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.400
Shaw.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.400
What is going on?

04:38.800 --> 04:41.100
What is this?
This is my Red Test.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.900
Why would they have
my surveillance footage
from my first kill?

04:44.800 --> 04:45.900
Just take a breath.

04:47.700 --> 04:50.000
This is the worst
moment of my life
up there on that monitor.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.000
I love you.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.900
Mine, too.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.900
What?

04:57.800 --> 04:58.800
Why? Who is she?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Evelyn Shaw.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.600
I killed your wife?

05:07.200 --> 05:09.400
?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.100
You had no idea that
the Ring was behind this.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.600
Shaw, I killed your wife.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.600
This isn't your fault.
I thought I was a good spy.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.400
This isn't your fault.

05:24.000 --> 05:24.900
Hey... it's okay.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.600
Chuck?

05:44.600 --> 05:47.700
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

05:47.700 --> 05:48.800
Move! Move! Move!

05:48.800 --> 05:49.800
The perimeter's surrounded.
Put your hands up!

05:49.800 --> 05:51.200
Down on the ground now!

05:51.900 --> 05:53.000
Now! Now!

05:53.000 --> 05:54.200
?

05:54.200 --> 05:55.000
MAN (over radio):
What's happening in there?

05:55.300 --> 05:56.200
Target's secure?

05:57.800 --> 05:58.700
This is Team Leader.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.200
Cancel air support.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.200
Cancel tactical.

06:04.800 --> 06:05.800
And the tank, the tank!

06:05.800 --> 06:06.600
Cancel the tank.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.900
Who on Earth gave you
the authority to call in a full tactical assault?

06:54.900 --> 06:56.000
I don't know what
to do with you,

06:56.000 --> 06:57.700
but I know you're not ready.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.000
But, General, it was Sarah.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.400
Come on. I had to...

07:00.400 --> 07:02.600
You want to see the bill
for your rescue mission?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
<i>It's longer than
my copy of Atlas Shrugged.</i>

07:05.000 --> 07:06.600
Look, you and I both
thought the worst.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.400
That Shaw had gone rogue.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.900
That he was going to...
Kill Sarah?

07:12.600 --> 07:13.400
Shaw.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.300
Sarah.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.000
Listen...

07:18.000 --> 07:19.100
You thought
I betrayed my country?

07:20.800 --> 07:24.200
General, Chuck's actions
were those of a true spy.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.500
He was looking out
for his partner
and the Agency.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.300
I would have done
the same myself.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.900
Maybe without
the stealth bombers,

07:31.900 --> 07:33.500
but perhaps
that's just me.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.000
Are you doing okay?

07:35.600 --> 07:37.400
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thank you.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.200
Thank you for saving me.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.300
I appreciated the tank.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.800
General,
did you check
Sarah's records?

07:45.200 --> 07:47.200
Any clues as to who
ordered her Red Test?

07:47.200 --> 07:51.500
I'm afraid, Sarah,
Langston Graham took
that secret to his grave.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.800
Well, okay, General, then what
are we supposed to do now?

07:53.800 --> 07:55.200
We disband the team.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.400
Surely, you can't operate
as an effective
unit with this history.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.500
General, if I may?

07:59.800 --> 08:02.600
This isn't the first
time they've used
one of our own

08:04.600 --> 08:06.100
I want to make sure
it's the last.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.600
You're saying you can
still work with Walker?

08:08.600 --> 08:09.400
I can.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.000
We both want
the same thing:

08:11.100 --> 08:13.200
to capture
the Director
and take down the Ring.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.200
Are you with me?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.100
Can we still be a team?

08:22.600 --> 08:23.700
Yes.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.200
Great.

08:27.300 --> 08:28.400
Everyone's back together again.

08:33.299 --> 08:34.299
What is it, boy?

08:34.299 --> 08:36.299
My demo station
don't cook by itself.

08:37.000 --> 08:37.900
I, uh...

08:40.799 --> 08:42.100
Spit it out, son.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.300
Is it your mama?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
It's Chuck. Is he okay?

08:52.200 --> 08:53.300
Jeff and Lester,
I could give

08:53.300 --> 08:54.600
a damn about them.
Go ahead and fire them.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.600
It's okay.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.400
Someone else?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.400
Who's the issue?
Me.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.700
Me. I'm the issue.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.100
This is tough.

09:04.900 --> 09:05.900
I'm quitting.

09:06.700 --> 09:07.600
I found a job.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.500
A real job.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.000
You can feel proud about it?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.300
You're not selling your body?

09:16.700 --> 09:17.600
You've got to go.

09:22.900 --> 09:23.700
Boy...

09:24.000 --> 09:27.200
I... I can't show emotions
like this.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.000
Those animals
out there, they'll...

09:29.700 --> 09:31.000
They'll get me if I do.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.100
I think Morgan's dying.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.800
I call dibs on his locker.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.700
Its location is far more
prestigious than my own.

09:42.700 --> 09:45.800
No, man. Those are
tears of joy.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.800
Morgan's leaving.
Grimes.

09:49.700 --> 09:50.900
Don't worry, John.

09:50.900 --> 09:52.700
You will always have us.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.000
And now,
sans Morgan,

09:54.000 --> 09:55.100
we have room!

09:55.500 --> 09:56.700
For what?

09:56.700 --> 10:00.200
For you.
In our crew, buddy.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.700
Come on. Hands in!

10:08.700 --> 10:10.300
You, you can let go
of my hand now.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.800
What is it, Bartowski?

10:17.800 --> 10:19.000
General, if I could
speak freely?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.500
<i>That's not a good idea.</i>

10:20.500 --> 10:22.900
As the titular member
of Team Bartowski,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.600
I think that it's crazy
to be putting Shaw
back in the field so soon.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.400
He just found out that
Sarah killed his wife, okay?

10:27.700 --> 10:29.700
The guy's got to be an emotional
train wreck right now.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.400
Nobody can control
their feelings that well.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.200
Chuck, what you are
seeing in Shaw
is an absolute professional:

10:35.200 --> 10:36.500
something you are not.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.600
That's why I'm moving them
out of Burbank.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.200
Moving who out of Burbank?

10:43.200 --> 10:44.500
Sarah and Shaw.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.400
I'm proceeding
with my original plan.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.800
They'll head up our Ring
task force in Washington.

10:52.000 --> 10:52.900
And what about me?

10:53.200 --> 10:55.700
You'll stay in Burbank until
I know what to do with you.

11:04.000 --> 11:04.800
Wa-pshh!

11:11.000 --> 11:12.100
Where you going, sport?

11:13.100 --> 11:14.000
New job?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.200
It's kind of secret.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.000
You're going to work for Chuck.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.900
I'm not a moron.

11:24.000 --> 11:24.800
All right.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.300
Isn't it awesome?
Can you believe it?

11:26.700 --> 11:27.600
Me, a spy.

11:28.100 --> 11:28.900
And listen,

11:28.900 --> 11:30.300
when-when General Beckman
lets you come back,

11:30.800 --> 11:32.000
me and you will be
spies together.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.200
Beckman doesn't forget
a small thing like "treason."

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
And, uh...

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I'm really learning
to enjoy my new life here.

11:41.000 --> 11:41.900
Are you kidding me?

11:42.800 --> 11:44.500
John, your old life
was so exciting.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.500
The adventures, the missions,
the weaponry,
the women...

11:46.500 --> 11:47.500
Please stop.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.900
Right. Got it.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.000
Learn to
lock it down.

11:51.700 --> 11:52.800
Well, I'll
tell you what.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.800
I'm glad you're
okay here, you know?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.000
Won't be the same
without you.

11:58.000 --> 11:58.800
But, uh...

12:00.300 --> 12:01.400
enjoy my old life.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.800
You, too.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.300
Got some very exciting news.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.400
Are you ready?
Hold onto your hat.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.400
I did it. I...

12:21.000 --> 12:22.100
What the heck is
going on here?

12:27.500 --> 12:29.200
Are you mixing
gaming with whiskey?

12:29.700 --> 12:30.900
She's leaving, man.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.500
Leaving with the other guy.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.300
No, this cannot happen.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.500
This cannot happen.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.300
I thought I stood a chance,
you know?

12:40.600 --> 12:41.700
Yeah, well,
just...

12:45.800 --> 12:46.800
Okay, okay, buddy.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.600
Hand it over.
Hmm-mm, hmm-mm. No.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.200
Let go.
No.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.100
You are on the precipice
of emotional ruin here.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.700
I'm already over the edge!
No, you're not!

12:54.700 --> 12:56.600
Soon you're gonna start
quoting liberally
from the works

12:56.600 --> 12:58.000
And then things
are gonna go dark.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.300
Things are gonna
go really dark,

12:59.300 --> 13:00.500
and I'm not gonna
let that happen.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.500
Morgan, hand over the bottle!

13:01.500 --> 13:02.300
Never!

13:06.200 --> 13:07.200
Yes, you will.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.200
Make me.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.100
I hope you're happy.

13:13.700 --> 13:16.200
She said she couldn't
be with someone
who didn't believe in her.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.600
Well, I believed in her.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.700
I just didn't believe in me.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.000
Dude, you are misquoting
the line,

13:24.100 --> 13:26.000
<i>and you are ruining
Pretty in Pink for me.</i>

13:26.000 --> 13:26.800
Now, just stop it.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.300
Put the cap back on
the top of the bottle,

13:28.300 --> 13:30.400
and let's forget that this
night ever happened. Okay?

13:30.400 --> 13:31.600
I'm really good at that, dude.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.200
I've forgotten
entire years, man.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.100
What is happening?

13:37.100 --> 13:38.100
Hey, Sarah.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.700
Chuck's in a,
a bit of a low spot.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.900
Yeah, yeah,

13:44.200 --> 13:45.000
I see that.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.200
He found out that
you're leaving with Shaw.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.300
He's also eaten an entire carton
of sugar-free mint ice cream,

13:49.400 --> 13:54.100
which is only concerning,
well, when you factor in
the large consumption

13:55.500 --> 13:56.300
Thank you.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.100
Morgan, can you
leave us please?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.200
I forgive you.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.700
Great, now I
hate this song.

14:04.700 --> 14:05.900
Look, I, uh...

14:08.500 --> 14:09.500
I know what I look like.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.600
The mint ice cream
sobered me up pretty good.

14:13.000 --> 14:13.800
Chuck, it's okay.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.900
No, it isn't.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.400
I thought I could save you.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.600
I thought Shaw was bad
and I was gonna save you,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.100
and we were gonna
be together.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.600
But that didn't happen.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.800
Shaw's a good spy.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.500
I get it, okay?

14:30.600 --> 14:32.200
I think everybody gets it.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.000
Shaw is amazing.

14:33.100 --> 14:36.200
And you two are gonna go run off
together and save the world.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.500
And that's great news
for the world.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.400
But earlier on
in my...

14:44.800 --> 14:45.900
drunken haze...

14:48.000 --> 14:51.600
I realized that I hadn't
asked you a question.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.800
Really important
question
that I'd like to ask you

14:57.700 --> 14:59.000
Just once,
for the record...

15:04.500 --> 15:05.700
Sarah, do you love me?

15:16.100 --> 15:17.200
Wow. I'm, uh,

15:17.200 --> 15:18.400
I'm in my underwear.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.200
I'm sitting in my underwear,
holding a plastic guitar.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.500
There's a very good chance
I'm making a complete fool
of myself, isn't there?

15:26.500 --> 15:27.500
Yes.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.800
I should probably
put some pants on.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.700
No, Chuck.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Yes.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.600
Wh... uh, what?

15:37.600 --> 15:40.700
Chuck, I fell
for you a long,
long time ago--

15:40.700 --> 15:42.700
after you fixed my phone

15:42.700 --> 15:45.800
and before you started defusing
bombs with computer viruses.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.600
So, yes.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.300
Yes.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.100
Wait, wait.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.800
What about my Red Test?

16:14.800 --> 16:15.900
Casey told me.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.800
He told me that
he killed the mole

16:17.800 --> 16:18.600
and that
you couldn't do it.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.300
And it was the best news
that I'd ever heard

16:20.300 --> 16:22.000
because it means
that you haven't changed.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
You're still Chuck.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.900
You're still my Chuck.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
I, uh, I will be
totally cleaned up
by tomorrow.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.600
Well, you don't have time
because we have a mission.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.400
Shaw found the
Ring headquarters.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.500
It's a three-man op,
and you're our third.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.100
Mission?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.000
No problem.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.600
Morgan, what are you doing?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.600
Right. Where are my manners?

16:53.600 --> 16:55.200
We haven't even met
professionally.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.400
Morgan Grimes.

16:56.600 --> 17:01.300
Agent of the CIA
and an assistant to one
Charles Irving Bartowski.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.000
Now, let's get to work here.

17:03.000 --> 17:03.800
You heard the lady.

17:04.099 --> 17:05.099
There is a mission,

17:05.500 --> 17:06.500
and you are needed.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Let's get you some coffee.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.500
You okay, Chuck?

17:19.500 --> 17:21.099
Huh, what, me? Yeah,
good. Totally cool.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.000
Yeah, ready to go.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.900
Everything is
totally normal.

17:26.800 --> 17:27.599
All right.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.100
Director has his own
private elevator.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.700
You two are gonna
rappel down to it.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.400
When the
Director leaves,
grab him; I'll pull you back up.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.300
Cool.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.100
Great.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.300
You think he
knows about us?

17:42.300 --> 17:44.000
I'm just saying...

17:46.000 --> 17:46.800
Okay, ready?

17:49.800 --> 17:51.800
Don't worry about the warehouse
or Beckman, Chuck.

17:53.700 --> 17:54.900
I trust you completely.

17:54.900 --> 17:55.700
Yeah.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.400
Okay, Shaw, we're in.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.000
What's the matter?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.900
Um, I have a concern about Shaw.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.100
While he, yes, is a very
great spy, emotionally,

18:25.100 --> 18:26.600
the guy is Swiss
cheese, okay?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.100
Chuck, Shaw is one step closer
to capturing the Director.

18:30.100 --> 18:33.100
And I'm sure that is all
he is thinking about,
so don't even worry.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.200
All right, Sarah, I'm accessing
the elevator's controls.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.000
What is it?
Someone heard something...

18:44.000 --> 18:44.800
Gentlemen.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
See! See! He knows!

18:56.000 --> 18:56.800
Shaw, are you okay?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.400
He's having a mental break.
We're fish in a barrel.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.400
Sorry about that, guys.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.800
Little Ring company.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.000
See, I told you he wasn't
trying to kill us.

19:19.100 --> 19:19.900
All right.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.100
I'm opening the hatch.

19:25.800 --> 19:26.900
Oh, don't worry.
It's a tranq gun.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.800
Okay, fine. Just
sell that it's real.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.400
Right, of course.
Ruthless spy.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.900
You're gonna take care of
most of them though, right?

19:33.000 --> 19:36.200
Sarah, internal security system
is detecting something moving
toward the elevator.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.800
Looks like the Director's
coming in early.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.400
Time to meet
our bad guy.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.300
One word and you're dead.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.900
Now, this is brazen.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.400
That... that was four words.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.100
Kidnapping me in my own lift.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.300
Impressive.

19:55.300 --> 19:58.000
But there's absolutely no chance
you'll get the Cipher.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.600
Did he just say Cipher?

20:01.000 --> 20:01.800
Yeah.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.600
What do you mean?
Don't play dumb.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.400
You're better than that.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.900
We've been building
our own Intersect for a year.

20:06.900 --> 20:07.700
You know that.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.900
Of course. The Cipher is
the Intersect's core processor.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.100
Fine, so it's here.
So where exactly is it?

20:12.200 --> 20:14.000
You won't get five feet
from this door.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.600
My security will be
on you in seconds.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.600
Well, that's tough because
either we get the Cipher or...

20:18.600 --> 20:19.500
Pull out your Ring phone.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.200
What Ring phone?

20:25.300 --> 20:26.900
You mean, this Ring phone?

20:26.900 --> 20:27.900
Yeah, that Ring phone
right there.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.000
Call your assistant.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.200
What?
You know, your secretary.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.900
Whoever you have.
Call him or her,

20:32.900 --> 20:34.400
have them bring
the Cipher to you here.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.000
And put it on speakerphone.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.900
You give her one warning,
and I'm gonna...

20:37.900 --> 20:39.700
Please.
I know the drill.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.400
Denise.

20:47.800 --> 20:48.900
Sir, you asked for this.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.600
Also, I spoke
with Operative 6.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.100
They'll proceed with the coup
in 15 minutes.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.400
The Spanish Ambassador
also called back
with the ransom offer.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.700
He wants to close
by end of day tomorrow
at the latest.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.000
Thank you, Denise.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.500
And please text me
when the plane lands
in Barcelona.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.700
"Barcelona"-- it's a code.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.200
Oh, "Barcelona's" a code?
That-that's good.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.600
What are we supposed
to do with her now?!

21:10.600 --> 21:11.900
Well, personally,
I'd shoot her.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.100
Decisions, decisions.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.000
Shaw, what's going on?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.300
Just need a few more seconds.
Well, we don't have seconds.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.100
Sorry, sir.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.000
One of our guys heard
something strange
in the elevator shaft.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.700
Hi, welcome to the party.

21:25.700 --> 21:26.800
This is getting ridiculous.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.800
I've got it. Here we go.

21:30.700 --> 21:31.900
You know it's over, right?

21:33.200 --> 21:34.000
What?

21:34.600 --> 21:35.800
This was a trap.

21:36.900 --> 21:37.900
For you.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.200
Okay, nobody move.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.200
We can all die here today.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.800
<i>You can all die here today.</i>

21:43.800 --> 21:45.300
Personally,
I have dinner reservations.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.300
Look at me.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.400
Do I look like an amateur?

21:49.400 --> 21:53.800
No, you don't,
but your partner here
is a very different story.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.900
Not much of a spy, are you?

21:56.500 --> 21:57.900
<i>I am a spy.</i>

21:58.400 --> 21:59.200
Really?

21:59.400 --> 22:00.600
With a tranq pistol?

22:01.200 --> 22:02.600
Real gun too dangerous
for you?

22:07.500 --> 22:08.700
Put it down.

22:12.300 --> 22:13.100
Sorry, Chuck.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.800
Daniel...

22:25.300 --> 22:26.900
still upset about your wife?

22:27.600 --> 22:30.600
You should
really learn to get
over that or take it out

22:31.000 --> 22:31.800
She pulled
the trigger.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.200
Go. Take the service elevator
to the fifth floor,

22:35.300 --> 22:36.500
then the north
stairwell.

22:36.600 --> 22:37.500
I'll get the Cipher.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.800
I'll meet you back at Castle.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.900
Shaw, we're not gonna
leave you here.

22:40.900 --> 22:42.500
Sarah, go, please.

22:56.100 --> 22:56.900
Did he...?

22:58.800 --> 22:59.900
You know, I think
you're right.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.500
I think we should
probably wait
to tell him about us.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.200
Good work, Daniel.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.500
I think they bought it.

23:22.800 --> 23:23.700
?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.500
You weren't supposed
to eliminate the Director, Shaw.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.900
This wasn't a red op.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.500
I did what I had to
to get my team out.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.000
Oh! That was a huge kick!
Where did we...?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.600
Where'd you get this?
Where'd we get this footage?

23:39.600 --> 23:41.900
I tapped into the building
security feed during the op.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.800
Wow, that's a hell
of a roundhouse, buddy.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.400
Uh, General, I do think
it's worth noting
that we would all be dead

23:51.800 --> 23:52.600
Very well.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.100
General, there's also
the issue of the Cipher.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.700
The Director said
that the Ring was making
a new Intersect.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.800
Relax. My team analyzed
their Cipher

23:59.800 --> 24:01.800
and found a number of problems
in the design.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.400
Obviously, the Ring isn't as far
along as they thought.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.100
Looks like the Cipher's
components
were fabricated in France.

24:07.100 --> 24:08.000
That's right, Shaw.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.400
I need you and Sarah to follow
this trail to Paris.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.900
We believe the Ring's design
facility is there.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.400
We can be in the air
in 30 minutes.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.200
Excuse me, General.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.900
Uh, what, what about me?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Sorry, Chuck, you're not ready.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.200
We are never gonna get
our chance, are we?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.000
Once I get back,
it's all gonna happen...

24:30.700 --> 24:31.700
you and me.

24:35.500 --> 24:36.300
Don't worry.

24:36.900 --> 24:37.900
Just one more mission.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.100
<i>Hey, look at you!</i>

24:41.100 --> 24:43.000
Nice! I take it
you and Sarah
are official.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.800
Now, the other guy,
he's out of the way?

24:46.200 --> 24:49.600
Well, actually, Sarah and Shaw
are on their way to Paris.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.600
Beckman doesn't think
I'm ready to be out
in the field.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.700
But other than that,
everything's fine.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.000
How is everything fine?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.900
Chuck, I quit my job
<i>so I could join you
in the field.</i>

24:58.900 --> 25:00.000
You did... you did what?!

25:00.000 --> 25:01.300
You said I was a part your team.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.300
That you were gonna speak
to Beckman about me.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.400
Did you speak
to Beckman about me?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.300
Of course you didn't.
No, why would you?

25:08.300 --> 25:09.800
I'm not a spy.
I'm an idiot.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.700
No, no, you're not an idiot.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.900
I gave up a management position
in a down economy.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Look, I'm sorry, buddy, okay?
I'm gonna talk to Beckman.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.800
Sarah's gonna come back
into town, and I will prove
that we are

25:18.800 --> 25:21.300
Chuck, are you kidding me?
None of that is gonna happen.

25:21.300 --> 25:23.100
Listen to me.
Shaw's gonna get Sarah, okay?

25:23.100 --> 25:25.400
And you're gonna go willy-nilly,
tie me up again

25:25.400 --> 25:27.100
<i>and drink yourself
into Guitar Hero oblivion.</i>

25:28.400 --> 25:30.200
I may have said
some unfortunate
things about Shaw,

25:30.200 --> 25:34.700
but the fact of
the matter is
the guy's exactly what

25:34.800 --> 25:36.100
That's nice. Good for him.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.700
Know what else he is, dude?
A stud, okay?

25:38.700 --> 25:41.400
And 99 times out of ten,
that guy gets the girl.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.200
We're done here!

25:42.300 --> 25:43.600
Buddy, Morgan, Morgan,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.600
look, I'm not supposed
to show you this,

25:46.400 --> 25:48.700
but it was so awesome,
I made a copy of it.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.500
It'll help prove my point.
Here we go.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.800
Okay, this is
from the mission.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.300
That is Shaw saving
our butts right there.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.700
Wait for it.
Wait for the roundhouse.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.400
That's gotta hurt.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.700
We have a problem.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.600
What?

26:05.600 --> 26:06.400
Chuck, look at this.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.200
He pulls that punch.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.200
And that roundhouse?

26:12.500 --> 26:13.700
It doesn't even land.

26:14.700 --> 26:17.000
But he shot people, Morgan!
Bad people!

26:17.500 --> 26:20.100
Did you see blood,
viscera, brain matter?

26:20.100 --> 26:21.600
Chuck, did you see
brain matter?

26:23.600 --> 26:24.800
Okay, listen to me.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.200
I have seen
every Hong Kong
fight film

26:27.200 --> 26:28.000
ever made, all right?

26:28.000 --> 26:31.100
I direct your attention
to my favorite
Sonny Chiba poster.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.200
I am the man
when it comes to this.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.000
You have to trust me.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.300
I can spot a fake action
sequence from a mile away.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.500
That's what we have here.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.800
But if the fight was staged,
that means that Shaw is working
with the Ring.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.400
And Sarah is with him.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.600
I'm uploading the fight footage
to Beckman's home computer now.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.200
Report, Chuck.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.100
Uh, General, I'm so sorry
about the hour,

26:59.100 --> 27:00.200
but we just figured
something out.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.300
Something very important.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.000
<i>Agent Shaw is working
with the Ring.</i>

27:03.300 --> 27:05.800
Chuck, how many times
do we have to do this?

27:05.800 --> 27:07.800
General, before, I was right
for the wrong reasons,

27:07.800 --> 27:09.700
but this time
I'm right
for the right reasons,

27:09.700 --> 27:10.800
and-and I have proof.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.200
Hi, there.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.600
<i>What is he doing here?!</i>

27:15.600 --> 27:17.900
Well, uh, first of all, sir,
uh, ma'am...

27:18.200 --> 27:19.100
Is it "sir"?
What am I doing?

27:19.100 --> 27:21.700
Just talk!
Okay. I'd like to thank you
for this opportunity.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.500
Stop! What are you doing there?!

27:24.500 --> 27:25.700
Me? I'm with him.

27:26.000 --> 27:26.800
I'm on Chuck's team.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.300
Oh, no. No, you're not
because Chuck's not on
his own team anymore.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.200
I want you both out
of Castle in five minutes!

27:33.200 --> 27:35.200
Chuck, you are suspended!

27:35.200 --> 27:37.600
No! No, no, General!

27:39.200 --> 27:40.500
Come on!
She's blocking my call.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.900
Well, okay, my time as a spy
was pretty exciting.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.200
A bit brief,
you know?

27:45.600 --> 27:46.400
You're still a spy.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.300
How's that, dude?

27:47.300 --> 27:49.900
Because right now I need a team,
and you're all
I've got, buddy, okay?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.500
CIA or no CIA.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.300
We need to save Sarah.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.200
Just the two of us.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.200
No, there is another.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.400
So now they're in Paris,
Sarah and Shaw.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.100
And Shaw, this time
for real, he is working
for the Ring.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.600
Now, I know that you
can't help me again.
I know all that.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.200
But Sarah's gonna die
without us.

28:07.800 --> 28:08.700
I can't do this alone.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.900
And I can't help you anymore.
I'm not a spy.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.900
<i>But you are a spy!
You're the ultimate spy!</i>

28:17.700 --> 28:20.000
<i>Was, Chuck, was.</i>

28:20.000 --> 28:21.500
But the man's
been Buy More'd.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.000
That's right.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.500
You deluded yourself
into thinking that
Buy More's your life.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.200
But wake up, John, okay?

28:28.300 --> 28:29.700
'Cause we need you
to get on this plane!

28:29.900 --> 28:31.400
Chuck needs you to get
on this plane.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.700
And if not,
that's cool, you know, find
yourself one Friday night

28:35.700 --> 28:38.600
in Jeff and
Lester's crew
hanging out in Woodland Hills.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.100
<i>I know this
because I was that guy.</i>

28:41.200 --> 28:44.900
But Chuck and Sarah
and you, Casey,

28:45.400 --> 28:47.600
you showed me that
I could be so much more,

28:47.600 --> 28:51.100
that I'm meant
for something:
to be a spy.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.000
What about you?

28:55.300 --> 28:56.600
What do you have left
in the tank?

28:57.400 --> 28:59.200
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

29:01.700 --> 29:04.700
Morgan, go to my closet
and get me my suit.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.100
The black one.

29:16.300 --> 29:17.200
Is this all of it?

29:18.300 --> 29:19.500
This is everything
I could find on Shaw.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.700
I can't believe
this is happening.

29:20.700 --> 29:21.800
She could be dead, Casey.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.000
Focus on the mission,
will ya?

29:32.700 --> 29:33.800
What is it? You just flashed.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.100
It's a mission
from ten years ago.

29:35.100 --> 29:36.200
It has nothing
to do with Sarah.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.500
I could flash on
everything in here,

29:37.500 --> 29:39.200
and we'd still be at square one
and have nothing.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.900
I'm stuck in the air right now
and there's nothing
I can do about it!

29:41.900 --> 29:42.900
Chuck, focus.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.500
Forget about
the Intersect.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.700
Forget about
being a spy.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Before all of that,
you were smart.

29:48.100 --> 29:49.100
Now we're gonna take
this intel,

29:49.100 --> 29:50.900
you're gonna figure out
where Sarah is.

29:51.400 --> 29:52.400
It's what you have to do.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.100
Where are you, Sarah?

30:24.400 --> 30:25.500
Something is off.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.300
What is it?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.200
Why did you bring me here?

30:41.300 --> 30:42.300
What do you mean?

30:46.200 --> 30:47.300
You led me here.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.300
Come on.
This is where I shot her.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.600
Is this some kind
of a trap?

30:51.400 --> 30:55.100
Sarah... you killed my wife.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.800
Did you really think
that I'd be okay with that?

31:02.200 --> 31:03.000
But you said that...

31:03.000 --> 31:04.600
I told you a lot of things
to get you here.

31:06.900 --> 31:08.200
The gun's getting heavy,
isn't it?

31:24.600 --> 31:26.300
You know, you could hurt someone
with this.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.500
There's a little cafe
around the corner.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.500
Let's sit down,
discuss the details.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.700
Just relax.
It's all over now.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.600
The drug is
a special toxin.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.200
It won't kill you.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.100
It simply immobilizes
your nervous system.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.000
I want you to see
what's gonna happen next.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.700
I need you to understand
why I'm doing this.

32:00.600 --> 32:04.600
So, Sarah, I see you've met
my newest Ring agent.

32:06.500 --> 32:07.300
Why?

32:08.000 --> 32:11.600
Well, I offered Daniel
the chanceto not only avenge
his wife's death,

32:11.600 --> 32:15.300
but to destroy
the very institution
that ordered her murder:

32:16.000 --> 32:17.300
The CIA 

32:26.700 --> 32:30.300
The CIA believed that
Eve had been turned by us.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.900
Your boss Langston Graham
assigned you to kill her.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.600
You did what
you were told.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.100
I'm going to send a message
to the CIA
that they betrayed

32:39.500 --> 32:40.600
DIRECTOR:
Very well put,
Daniel.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.800
They need to know
what they did to me.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.500
They need to feel
the pain that I felt.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.500
And that... is why
I have to kill you.

32:54.300 --> 32:55.900
On that note,
do you have it with you?

32:59.000 --> 33:02.600
The report details the problems
with your Cipher.

33:02.600 --> 33:05.500
The technical data
should help your scientists
complete the new Intersect.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.300
DIRECTOR:
Thank you, Daniel.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.600
We'll be in touch.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.100
Do you need us to, uh...?
No.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.300
I want to show her
the river.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.200
It's...

33:18.200 --> 33:19.000
beautiful at night.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.000
Well, good
night, then.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Good-bye, Sarah.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.300
Almost time to go.

33:43.000 --> 33:43.900
How'd you find me?

33:45.700 --> 33:46.600
I've read your file...

33:47.400 --> 33:49.400
your wife's, every
mission you've been on,

33:49.400 --> 33:50.700
every paper you
wrote at West Point,

33:50.700 --> 33:51.700
every travel report.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.900
You come here once a year
in memory of your wife's death.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.500
It made morbid sense
that you'd want Sarah
to see it, too.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.700
Smart. Very smart.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
CHUCK:
You're under arrest.

34:03.000 --> 34:03.900
Now, stand up.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.200
Less smart, Chuck.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.100
You should pull
the trigger. Now.

34:10.699 --> 34:11.500
Kill me.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I wouldn't do that.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.600
I see you brought Casey.

34:27.300 --> 34:28.300
Oh, yes, I did...

34:29.400 --> 34:31.699
and he's currently taking care
of your new Director.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.100
And you've got me?

34:35.300 --> 34:37.500
Stand... up.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.000
I guess the gun
was his idea.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.199
Good.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.500
No, Shaw, don't do this.

35:23.900 --> 35:25.000
You can't flash,
can you?

35:25.700 --> 35:27.900
Those emotions get you
into trouble.

35:29.800 --> 35:30.800
Now, you just stay here.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
I don't want to hurt you.

35:32.800 --> 35:33.900
None of this
was your fault.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.200
I haven't told them
your secret.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.100
But if you follow me...

35:39.200 --> 35:40.300
I will kill you.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.200
Sarah!

36:02.500 --> 36:03.900
The drug will
dull the pain.

36:05.300 --> 36:06.500
You won't feel a thing.

36:07.800 --> 36:08.700
Stop!

36:12.000 --> 36:12.900
I warned you.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.600
Please...

36:17.000 --> 36:18.400
it doesn't have to be like this.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.800
This isn't you, Shaw.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.200
You can't do this.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.200
Happy birthday.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.700
I love you.

36:38.300 --> 36:39.800
<i>No, Chuck, I can.</i>

36:40.800 --> 36:41.500
<i>You can't.</i>

36:53.000 --> 36:54.100
Sarah!

36:58.200 --> 37:01.800
Sarah... Sarah...

37:20.900 --> 37:22.300
Sarah...

37:42.200 --> 37:43.500
We've been over this.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.400
You no longer work for me, John.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.600
Unless there's a sale
at the Buy More,

37:47.600 --> 37:49.200
we have nothing to talk about.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.700
Mm. Then I guess you
don't want to talk about...

37:52.700 --> 37:54.300
my little friend
here, hmm?

37:54.600 --> 37:55.700
The Ring Director.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.800
What do you want for him?

38:01.700 --> 38:04.400
Well... full reinstatement,
my old rank back,

38:05.700 --> 38:07.000
and a new Crown Victoria...

38:10.500 --> 38:12.500
And a request you're
probably not gonna like.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.000
It-it seemed like a good job,

38:15.000 --> 38:16.800
but I just...
couldn't cut it.

38:18.100 --> 38:20.000
What I came here
to ask of you is...

38:22.000 --> 38:23.400
can I come back
to the store, sir?

38:25.900 --> 38:26.700
Uh... maybe?

38:27.600 --> 38:28.400
Just...

38:31.200 --> 38:32.100
I'll see my way out.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.000
Not yet.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.000
I couldn't bear to put
the offer out there.

38:42.800 --> 38:43.900
It's been here waiting for you.

38:49.700 --> 38:50.700
Don't worry, son.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.800
You can always come home.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.700
Thanks a lot, Big Mike.
Dad.

38:57.000 --> 38:57.900
(chuckles):
Yeah.

38:58.000 --> 38:58.800
Thanks, Big Mike.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.800
Papi.
Let's go with "Dad."
Thanks, Dad.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.200
I like that one.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.400
BECKMAN:
Is this Morgan Grimes?

39:11.600 --> 39:12.500
Yeah. Who dis?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.700
This is General Beckman
of the NSA.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.300
I am calling to say...

39:19.200 --> 39:22.400
that you are officially a member
of Operation Bartowski.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.500
You're not kidding me, are you?

39:23.800 --> 39:27.200
This isn't some sort of...
mean prank or anything, is it?

39:27.600 --> 39:29.600
No. We don't do pranks.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.100
You can thank Colonel Casey.

39:32.300 --> 39:33.200
Okay, I got to go quit my job.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.600
Hold on a second.
Don't do that.

39:35.300 --> 39:36.900
Your cover is the Buy More.

39:37.300 --> 39:38.900
Right. Right, that's perfect.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.400
That's perfect.
I'm good at that.

39:40.800 --> 39:41.800
Aye, aye, Captain.

39:42.000 --> 39:42.900
General.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.300
It's General.

39:44.300 --> 39:45.700
Of course. General. General.

39:46.100 --> 39:47.200
Thank you... thank you, sir.

39:47.700 --> 39:48.300
Ma'am.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.400
I will not let you down.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Are you... Hello?

39:51.200 --> 39:52.200
Hello?

40:05.000 --> 40:05.800
Hey.

40:12.700 --> 40:13.800
How you feeling?

40:14.800 --> 40:16.300
Oh, what happened?

40:20.500 --> 40:21.900
Everything's okay now.

40:23.700 --> 40:25.300
What about Shaw?

40:28.700 --> 40:29.500
He's dead.

40:33.500 --> 40:34.400
I'm sorry.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.200
Oh, my God, we...

40:37.800 --> 40:38.900
there was a...

40:39.000 --> 40:40.200
there was a cafe and...

40:41.500 --> 40:43.300
and a bridge, and he
tried to kill me, and...

40:46.000 --> 40:47.500
Oh, my God, you shot him.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.100
I couldn't let him
hurt you, Sarah.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.300
Trust me, I did
what I had to do.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.200
But I'm still the same guy.
I'm still Chuck.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.200
I promise.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.400
You saved me.

41:23.300 --> 41:25.400
Chuck, Sarah,
excellent work.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.800
I've consulted
with Colonel Casey,

41:26.800 --> 41:28.000
and he brought me up to speed.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.500
I'll expect a full report
when you get back to Burbank.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.600
Actually, General,
I think we're gonna need
a few more days

41:34.600 --> 41:36.200
No, I want you back ASAP.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.300
We have a new mission.

41:37.400 --> 41:40.100
Last night a team of Peruvian
assassins broke into...

41:41.200 --> 41:42.600
Agent Bartowski?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Agent Walker?

41:45.000 --> 41:46.700
I've lost contact.
Get them back.

41:48.000 --> 41:48.600
I don't...

41:48.600 --> 41:50.000
Then shut up
and kiss me.
