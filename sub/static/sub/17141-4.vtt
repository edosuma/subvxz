WEBVTT

00:05.548 --> 00:06.882
[Miranda] How do you get
this thing in here?

00:06.965 --> 00:08.884
[Jim] You just, uh, put it...
Let me help you--

00:08.967 --> 00:10.052
No, I'm trying to do it.

00:10.135 --> 00:13.972
[Jim] We can do it together.
It's a camera. It's very expensive.

00:14.056 --> 00:16.225
I think I got it. Did it. Okay.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.770
[softly] Okay.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.480
And three, two, one.
Action.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.192
Hey, guys.
It's me, Miranda.

00:25.275 --> 00:29.487
So, I've decided I'm gonna start singing
some of the many requests that I get.

00:29.572 --> 00:30.656
So...

00:31.615 --> 00:34.492
I haven't gotten any yet, so I'm
just gonna request a song for myself.

00:34.577 --> 00:35.578
So, I'm gonna do--

00:36.453 --> 00:37.913
[sighs] Oh.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.749
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.
[chuckles nervously]

00:40.833 --> 00:44.962
What are you doing in my house?

00:45.045 --> 00:47.297
Laundry. You have any for me?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.592
-Out.
-[Keith softly] Okeydokey.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.263
[chomping]

00:57.515 --> 00:58.767
Can I help you?

00:59.810 --> 01:01.269
Got any laundry for me?

01:02.020 --> 01:03.814
That depends.
What are you gonna do with it?

01:03.897 --> 01:05.608
You are not welcome here!

01:05.691 --> 01:07.484
So take your little laundry basket
and get out!

01:07.568 --> 01:09.027
-Get out!
-No trespassing!

01:09.111 --> 01:10.904
Okay, Keith.
What's going on?

01:10.988 --> 01:13.240
Mom, I swear if you do not get him
out of this house right now...

01:13.323 --> 01:15.951
Yes. Yes, you're right.
Yeah, you should go.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.119
But you don't want me to.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.746
Yeah, I don't want him to.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.873
-What?
-Oh, no! He's gonna...

01:20.956 --> 01:22.540
He's my friend...

01:22.625 --> 01:23.834
[all yelling]

01:25.753 --> 01:27.379
All right, that's enough!

01:28.964 --> 01:30.340
I'm calling a family meeting.

01:30.423 --> 01:33.135
Oh, no, no, no.
You can't call a family meeting.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.803
I can call a family meeting.

01:34.887 --> 01:38.223
As a matter of fact,
I think it's time we had a family meeting.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.975
So, family meeting time!

01:41.727 --> 01:45.272
Welcome to our first-ever family meeting.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.692
First order of business
in the family meeting...

01:48.776 --> 01:50.736
Keith has something to say.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.529
So, the floor is yours.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.697
[Keith claps hands]

01:53.781 --> 01:55.157
Let's begin.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.034
I already began it, but go ahead.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.286
[claps] Have an announcement to make.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.413
Your mother and I--

02:01.496 --> 02:03.498
-Are just friends.
-[Keith] Oh no, no, no, no, Bethany.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.669
I can't hide these feelings
inside any longer. Listen.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.502
Your mom and I...

02:08.586 --> 02:12.299
have been dating secretly
ever since the funeral.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.717
[yells] What?

02:13.801 --> 02:16.511
[stammers] Okay, Miranda, I can explain.
We're not really dating.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.013
No, I refuse this.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.848
You are not allowed in this house
or in my mother!

02:19.932 --> 02:20.933
[Keith] I know.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.601
I know this is an uphill battle for me.

02:23.686 --> 02:25.729
And I have hurt you...

02:25.813 --> 02:28.023
and for that I'm so sorry.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.859
Actually, that's why
I came here this morning.

02:30.943 --> 02:34.905
Doing the laundry. You know,
it's my way of apologizing to you,

02:34.988 --> 02:36.782
showing my love to Bethany.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.075
Getting to know Emily.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.411
And what about me?

02:41.494 --> 02:42.955
Won't be doing your laundry.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.165
Well, this is ridiculous!

02:45.248 --> 02:47.751
You know what, Keith?
I don't accept your apology.

02:47.835 --> 02:48.836
-How about that?
-Good.

02:48.919 --> 02:52.172
[sighs] You know, Miranda, I really think
you're gonna grow to like me.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.216
If you just give me a chance.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.552
Give you a chance?

02:57.635 --> 02:58.804
[softly] Yeah.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.265
First of all,
you kicked me out of the choir,

03:02.349 --> 03:05.102
then you manipulate with my mother.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.062
After that, you barge in my room

03:07.145 --> 03:09.606
and you interrupt
my private video time with my uncle.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.610
And to top it all off, you tried to steal
my perfectly good, dirty clothes.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.778
[takes deep breath]

03:14.862 --> 03:18.031
Like the Lord said to Noah
after he built the ark...

03:18.115 --> 03:20.033
"You're gonna regret this."

03:20.117 --> 03:21.409
Ooh, Bible burn.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.870
In your face.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.498
But you know what?

03:26.581 --> 03:28.333
I've been thinking
about that whole choir thing,

03:28.416 --> 03:30.460
and I wanna make it up to you

03:30.543 --> 03:33.713
by helping you with your singing career,
if you'll let me.

03:33.797 --> 03:36.133
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
We are not interested.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.676
Ever thought about performing live?

03:39.677 --> 03:43.223
Well, how about the Thea Foss Theatre?

03:43.306 --> 03:45.142
[scoffs] That place is impossible to book.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.434
I've tried.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.560
[whispers] I know a guy.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.980
We don't need your help, okay?

03:50.063 --> 03:55.652
I'm already, uh, trying to get Miranda
several other very important gigs.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.779
[Keith] Hmm.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.990
-The Thea Foss Theatre.
-[Keith] And I can call him...

04:00.615 --> 04:01.575
right now.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.659
No!

04:02.743 --> 04:04.870
Miranda, you don't need that,

04:04.953 --> 04:08.665
because I've already gotten you a...
a gig that's better.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.043
Really? Where?

04:11.126 --> 04:14.171
Uh... [sighs] where?
Uh...

04:15.588 --> 04:17.423
Uh... [clears throat]

04:18.091 --> 04:21.636
At a very reputable theater...

04:22.345 --> 04:23.764
in the Big Attle.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.141
-The Big Apple?
-New York?

04:27.059 --> 04:28.769
The Big Attle.
Seattle?

04:28.852 --> 04:29.978
Seattle?

04:30.062 --> 04:32.856
Wow, this is gonna be
amazing for my career.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.316
Why didn't you tell me
about it sooner?

04:34.399 --> 04:36.443
Well, I, uh...
[smacks lips]

04:36.526 --> 04:38.028
I wanted it to be a surprise.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.863
Oh, a surprise?

04:39.947 --> 04:42.032
I love it.
Do you have any more surprises?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.242
[Jim] Yes. I have, uh,

04:44.326 --> 04:47.579
-way more surprises.
-Oh, like what?

04:47.662 --> 04:50.623
Uh... like a tour bus.

04:51.624 --> 04:52.918
[Miranda] What else?

04:53.001 --> 04:55.838
-Uh, else? Uh, a... a roadie.
-What else?

04:55.921 --> 04:59.842
-Uh, jeez. [stuttering] Snacks.
-[gasps] Ooh, snacks!

04:59.925 --> 05:01.551
-I love snacks!
-Okay.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.428
-She loves snacks.
-This is so exciting.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.637
I win.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.640
This will be fun.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.435
[theme music playing]

05:14.772 --> 05:16.274
[sighs]

05:16.358 --> 05:20.612
Operator, get me your most
reputable theater in Seattle.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.280
Yes, I'll hold.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.200
I got that paint you asked for.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.495
Perfect. Um, Patrick,
I have a business opportunity,

05:28.578 --> 05:30.372
which I think you'd be perfect for.

05:30.455 --> 05:34.542
Okay. Uh, well, I'm about to get
really busy with the ice cream bike.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.044
I think once this fog lets up,

05:36.128 --> 05:37.462
-I'll see a big influx in the sales--
-[sighs]

05:37.545 --> 05:38.922
[stammers] Forget all that.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.507
Close the door. Yes.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.010
Okay.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.053
Now, Patrick,
what I am about to tell you

05:45.137 --> 05:46.889
is for your eyes only.

05:46.972 --> 05:50.475
Miranda is about to start her world tour.

05:50.558 --> 05:53.896
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm. A huge gig in, uh, Seattle.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.065
-The Big Attle.
-Yep.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.151
And she needs a roadie.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.235
I'll do it.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.238
I gotta warn you.
It's, uh, long hours and no pay.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.489
It's fine, fine, fine.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.409
You'll be crammed
into a small dressing room with Miranda,

06:07.492 --> 06:09.036
and you'll have to do
whatever she says.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.412
Yes!
I mean, you don't...

06:10.495 --> 06:13.706
[stuttering] You don't need
to talk me into it anymore, because...

06:13.790 --> 06:16.043
[takes deep breath] I'm your roadie.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.130
Okay, we can start by taking this paint
and decorating the tour bus.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.132
It's the one parked in the driveway.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.093
-I'm thinking of something tasteful--
-Uh, say no more.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.429
I've sketched this out
a dozen times already.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.018
Oh! [stammering] Uh, hello.

06:33.101 --> 06:37.397
My name is Jim, Uncle Jim.
And I have an act so sensational,

06:37.480 --> 06:40.317
you'll wanna book it immediately.
It's my--

06:40.400 --> 06:42.902
Just let me finish.
Let me finish.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.737
It's my niece, Miranda.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.531
She's been on YouTube...

06:46.614 --> 06:47.782
[stammers]

06:48.700 --> 06:50.160
Hello?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.328
Hello?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.874
So, things going well with Keith?

06:56.959 --> 07:00.337
Oh, they are going fantastic.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.255
He is such a great guy.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.382
Do you know he does hospice ministry?

07:04.466 --> 07:07.927
Can you imagine being around all that pain

07:08.011 --> 07:10.430
all day and all night?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.807
-[sighs]
-Yeah, I have a general idea.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.103
Ouch.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.562
Ow...

07:18.771 --> 07:20.857
-[sighs]
-Oh, let me get that for you,

07:20.941 --> 07:23.318
-my little cherubim.
-Aw.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.736
[Keith chuckles]

07:26.196 --> 07:27.739
If you ever...

07:27.822 --> 07:29.992
need me to get that down for you...

07:30.075 --> 07:31.201
just let me know.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.285
Okay.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.496
-Like, if I'm making a big beef stew...
-Mmm-hmm.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.289
-...I'll know who to call.
-[chuckles] You do.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.624
I do. [chuckles]

07:39.626 --> 07:40.793
Uh, Mom?

07:40.877 --> 07:42.545
-Huh?
-Might wanna tone it down

07:42.629 --> 07:44.672
on the fake carpal tunnel with this guy.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.051
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.346
Okay, he seems like a really nice guy,

07:51.429 --> 07:54.932
and you have him doing all these chores
just because he thinks you're sick.

07:55.017 --> 07:56.684
You can't take advantage
of someone like that.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.603
What?

07:58.686 --> 08:00.480
No, I am not.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.233
I mean, he...
he just likes taking care of me.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.651
[Keith] Hope you don't mind,

08:04.734 --> 08:06.944
but I threw in a few of my things
in the wash.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.198
[Emily] Well...

08:10.282 --> 08:13.243
there goes the last
of my childhood innocence.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.494
What?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.373
[door opens and closes]

08:20.583 --> 08:22.460
Well, this is interesting.

08:22.544 --> 08:23.961
That's my chair.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.422
Oh, it is?

08:25.505 --> 08:26.714
Yes, it is.

08:26.798 --> 08:27.965
Then why aren't you using it?

08:28.050 --> 08:29.842
Because you are sitting in it.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.011
Exactly.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.929
I don't like your attitude.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.015
[yells] Bethany!

08:36.099 --> 08:38.559
-What?
-I don't have any clean underwear.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.313
-Really?
-Yep. Is it in the wash or where is it?

08:41.395 --> 08:44.732
Well, I'm sorry, but the machine
has been in use all day.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.819
Great, Bethany.
I am supposed to go on a big road trip.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.988
I have my manager outfit all picked out,

08:51.073 --> 08:52.574
and I don't have any clean panties.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.828
So, I guess we're gonna have to cancel
the gig that I definitely booked.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.164
The trip is canceled.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.582
Well, I can take her.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.085
I've got plenty of fresh underwear.
[chuckles]

09:03.168 --> 09:04.419
Oh, yeah?

09:06.000 --> 09:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:34.241 --> 09:36.409
Trip uncanceled.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.829
Miranda, we're going!

09:44.292 --> 09:45.877
Okay, everybody.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.920
In...

09:48.004 --> 09:50.132
[all] Three, two...

09:50.215 --> 09:51.258
one.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.884
[Patrick] Blast off!

09:53.885 --> 09:55.220
[chuckles]

09:57.389 --> 09:58.806
[Bethany] Oh...

09:58.890 --> 10:00.057
That's perfect.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.352
[Miranda] It's pretty good.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.937
-Yeah.
-I probably could've done better.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.356
So, you decorated my van.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.941
Is that permanent paint?

10:09.942 --> 10:11.403
What do you care, Mom?

10:11.486 --> 10:15.282
I'm going on tour and you're
never gonna see me or the van again.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.159
So have fun with your
little choir-kicker-outer, Keith.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.536
-We're leaving now.
-Uh, Miranda,

10:19.619 --> 10:21.621
we don't have to leave for another, uh,

10:21.704 --> 10:23.665
two, three, four hours or so.
So...

10:23.748 --> 10:26.251
No. No, we have to leave now.
I have to do sound check,

10:26.334 --> 10:29.837
a dress rehearsal, costume fittings,
makeup, all these kinds of things.

10:29.921 --> 10:33.175
Well, we can't leave. We have
that whole list of props we need to get.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.676
Oh, I already got 'em.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.512
What? How?
You got the entire list?

10:37.595 --> 10:40.973
The bubble machine?
The Princess Diana Beanie Baby?

10:41.057 --> 10:43.143
Yep, with the tag protector still on.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.561
-Oh. Good work.
-[Jim sighs]

10:44.644 --> 10:46.688
Okay, well, um...

10:46.771 --> 10:49.232
I guess there's no reason...

10:49.316 --> 10:52.985
for us to stay here and not go.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.196
So...

10:55.155 --> 10:56.406
we'll go.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.199
So, goodbye, Mom!

10:58.283 --> 10:59.659
I won't even miss you.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.036
-Oh, now, Miranda... What?
-No, no, no, no. Wait.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.580
-Let 'em go have their fun.
-[van door closes]

11:03.663 --> 11:05.332
-[engine starting]
-She'll be back.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.681
Well, now how am I
supposed to get to work?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.810
How big is the theater?

11:25.893 --> 11:28.271
Uh, big.
Uh, yeah, yeah, it's, uh, gigantic.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.358
But if it seems small, it's 'cause it's...
it's intimate, you know.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.984
So it may seem small to you, so...

11:33.067 --> 11:36.112
It's one of those theaters that can
go any way, really, you know. [chuckles]

11:36.195 --> 11:38.490
-What's it called?
-Um, uh, let's...

11:38.573 --> 11:40.450
That'll be a surprise.
That'll be a surprise.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.743
How much am I getting paid?

11:41.826 --> 11:45.247
Miranda, Miranda, okay, just...
No more questions.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.624
You haven't even written a rider yet.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.335
-What the heck is that?
-It's a list of demands

11:50.418 --> 11:52.712
that all celebrities have.
It shows people how, uh,

11:52.795 --> 11:54.922
special and unreasonable you can be.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.549
Mmm, all right.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.884
Roadie, paper.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.886
It'll take a while to write it.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.763
Thank you very much.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.055
Okay.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.891
Oh, there's a gas station over there.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.435
We should, uh, pull over
and stop a while and get gas.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.938
Uh-huh. Well, I'm noticing that Miranda's
really in a hurry to get to her show,

12:11.022 --> 12:12.774
and it looks like we have enough gas.

12:12.857 --> 12:16.152
Uh, Patrick, have you
ever driven a tour bus before?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.738
Uh, no.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.740
Then I would appreciate it
if you didn't give advice

12:20.823 --> 12:22.325
about things that you know nothing about.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.077
This is a lot more complicated
than an ice cream bike.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.829
How do you spell "salami"?

12:26.913 --> 12:30.417
S-A-L-A-M-N-I.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.584
Salami.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.794
Got it.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.515
Fill her up, Patrick!

12:52.063 --> 12:53.315
[clears throat]

12:53.398 --> 12:54.441
[man] <i>Hello?</i>

12:54.524 --> 12:56.651
Hello! Oh, thank God
you finally picked up.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.236
Listen, I have a fantastic act

12:59.321 --> 13:01.614
featuring a well-known YouTube sensation,

13:01.698 --> 13:03.825
and I need a gig tonight for--

13:03.908 --> 13:06.160
Uh, at a reputable theater, please.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.372
<i>Is this the guy that keeps leaving</i>
<i>all those weird messages?</i>

13:09.456 --> 13:12.249
<i>Listen, I think you're confused.</i>
<i>This is a bookstore.</i>

13:12.334 --> 13:13.876
This isn't Broadway Booking?

13:13.960 --> 13:17.922
Uh, this is Broadway Book, Inc.
Like, "incorporated."

13:18.005 --> 13:19.341
Incorporated?

13:19.424 --> 13:20.717
<i>Are you okay, man?</i>

13:20.800 --> 13:23.970
It sounded like you were crying
in your last message.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.724
Okay, can she just...
Can she just sing at your bookstore,

13:27.807 --> 13:30.101
like, while people are buying books?
Is that...

13:30.184 --> 13:32.812
is that something that we can do?
We could work out between us...

13:33.730 --> 13:35.565
<i>Um... I don't think...</i>

13:35.648 --> 13:38.610
Oh... [stammers]
You tell that tech guy

13:38.693 --> 13:41.070
that if he can't handle those
lighting cues that I sent over,

13:41.153 --> 13:44.073
well, then he should find
himself another job.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.951
You tell him that.
Yep. [chuckles]

13:47.869 --> 13:51.288
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry I yelled at you, sir.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.915
Can she just sing?

13:53.833 --> 13:54.876
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

13:54.959 --> 13:57.336
I respect that answer. [sniffles]

13:57.420 --> 13:58.588
[exclaims]

13:59.547 --> 14:00.757
[grunts]

14:04.886 --> 14:06.220
[mouths] You see that?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.728
[softly] This is my foot.
Does it look like this?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.570
See this resemblance there?

14:25.281 --> 14:26.574
[Miranda grunting softly]

14:35.583 --> 14:36.876
[grunting]

14:41.381 --> 14:42.507
What're you doing?

14:44.717 --> 14:48.095
Uh, I'm just testing the tires

14:48.179 --> 14:52.224
in case we run over
any knives on the road.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.060
You never can be too careful,
you know.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.895
[continues grunting]

14:58.690 --> 15:01.776
[Miranda clears throat]
Welcome, everyone, to my show.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.696
-My name is Miranda Jo--
-You know what might...

15:04.779 --> 15:09.534
Sorry, I was thinking, you should
probably come up with, uh, a stage name.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.703
For protection reasons.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.079
Oh yeah, he... he's right.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.331
You should take your time
and come up with a stage name, you know.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.251
-Uh, everyone in the business uses one.
-Yeah, I didn't even think about that.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.254
I don't wanna get a stalker
coming to my house. [chuckles]

15:22.338 --> 15:24.006
All right, let me think.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.300
Miranda... Car.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.469
No.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.596
Miranda... Shirt.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.138
-No.
-Miranda Shirt. No.

15:31.222 --> 15:33.099
Miranda... Person.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.601
Miranda Person. No.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.103
Miranda Store.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.855
Miranda Store.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.314
No.
Miranda--

15:40.397 --> 15:42.358
Okay, just stop it.
Stop it, okay?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.318
There's an age-old system for this.

15:44.401 --> 15:47.614
You simply take the name
of the first street you lived on,

15:47.697 --> 15:51.868
plus the name of your first pet,
and that gives you your stage name, okay?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.496
Just stop with those ridiculous names.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.997
Okay, okay.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.040
So that would be...

15:58.124 --> 16:01.085
-Forty-seventh Street Scabs.
-See, perfect.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.463
Forty-seventh Street Scabs it is.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.548
What a wonderful stage name.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.468
Um... can I still call you Miranda?

16:08.551 --> 16:10.052
Yeah, I like my old name better.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.389
What... what about Miranda Mooney?

16:13.473 --> 16:16.601
Mooney?
Patrick, that's your last name!

16:16.684 --> 16:18.352
[stammering] That's stupid.
[chuckles]

16:18.435 --> 16:20.146
It was a stupid idea.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.313
[mutters] I don't know.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.774
[gasps]

16:22.857 --> 16:24.400
What about Sings?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.528
That way everyone'll know
what my talent is.

16:26.611 --> 16:30.156
So, Forty-seventh Street Scabs Sings
it is then.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.950
We'll just have to check,
make sure no one else has that name.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.036
No, no.
Miranda Sings.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.788
Just plain Miranda Sings.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.414
I think it's beautiful.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.628
Miranda Sings.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.380
[Keith sighs]

16:48.966 --> 16:52.219
[chuckles] Normally, I give the Lord
all the praise for a meal,

16:52.303 --> 16:55.347
but what you have done
with this casserole... [chuckles]

16:55.431 --> 16:57.809
is nothing short of a culinary miracle.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.646
-Really?
-Oh, absolutely.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.859
Well, I recommend putting ketchup on it,
if you like. Ow.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.361
Oh, oh.
Allow me. Allow me.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.075
[ketchup squirting]

17:20.330 --> 17:21.749
Your mother tells me you like to paint.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.667
Mom said that?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.462
Who's your favorite artist?

17:28.339 --> 17:30.216
It's not a trick question.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.971
Sorry. No. I just... I'm not used to being
the topic of conversation at the table.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.472
Mmm.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.559
Well, I think it's time for a lot
of things to change around here.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.978
Um...

17:42.061 --> 17:44.564
well then, maybe Frida Kahlo.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.899
Kahlo. Uh, let's see.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.819
She painted <i>The Wounded Deer.</i>

17:51.278 --> 17:52.529
Yeah. Wow.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.240
She did.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.825
One of my favorites.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.125
[squirting]

18:06.836 --> 18:08.170
[Miranda] Are we there yet?

18:08.254 --> 18:09.421
[Jim] Not much longer.

18:09.505 --> 18:14.427
Hey, Patrick, keep an eye out
for any theaters because, uh...

18:14.510 --> 18:16.679
one of them might work.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.931
Because it will be the one

18:19.015 --> 18:22.518
that I booked, uh, prior, earlier.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.895
Roger that.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.606
-[police siren wails]
-[gasps]

18:26.689 --> 18:29.525
Oh, no! You two keep quiet.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.443
It's the feds.
Let me handle this.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.945
Uncle Jim, we don't have time for this.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.072
Just tell them I'm a celebrity
and they'll let us go.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.908
I'll do all the talking.
[breathing heavily]

18:36.991 --> 18:39.368
Okay, Uncle Jim, you just need
to stay calm and don't freak out!

18:39.452 --> 18:41.495
-I am calm. How do I look?
-Try and keep calm.

18:41.578 --> 18:42.622
-[Miranda] You look stressed!
-He's here!

18:42.705 --> 18:44.040
He's here!
He's here.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.379
Good evening to you, my good sir.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.215
-License and registration.
-Yes, of course.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.717
Oh. [grunts softly]

18:54.801 --> 18:57.386
It should be one of those things.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.347
You have any idea
why I pulled you over tonight?

19:00.431 --> 19:01.557
No, no idea.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.434
In your best estimate,

19:03.517 --> 19:05.436
how long do you think
this will take? Like...

19:05.519 --> 19:09.231
are we looking at jail time,
possibly, maybe, hopefully?

19:09.315 --> 19:10.692
No.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.276
But we will need to impound your vehicle.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.903
I can't have you driving this thing around

19:13.986 --> 19:16.530
with the windows
and signal lights covered over.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.700
No. No, you can't do that.
You can't do that!

19:18.783 --> 19:20.785
I have a show to get to.
I'm a performer.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.161
Miranda, please!

19:22.244 --> 19:25.039
Let me handle this.
Here are the keys,

19:25.122 --> 19:28.250
and be careful backing this thing up
because you cannot see a thing.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.294
-Uncle Jim!
-It's true.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.879
I can't see anything.
It's a death trap.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.882
You can pick it up tonight, once you
pay the fine and make it street legal.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.050
Okay, thank you.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.052
[whispering] And take your time.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.180
Oh! Yes, good sir, thank you.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.556
[clears throat]

19:43.766 --> 19:45.768
Well, that went well.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.770
That went very well.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.778
[crying] How can they do this?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.239
My first world tour and it's ruined.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.532
What are you doing?

20:01.492 --> 20:03.953
Calling Bethany to help us get home.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.706
-[Miranda] What? No!
-Wait, we can still make it.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.208
We can, uh, hop in a cab or a bus.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.667
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, let's do that.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.378
No. No, we can't do that.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.005
[stutters] We have to go.
Bethany has to take--

20:14.088 --> 20:16.007
Uncle Jim, come on.
We're gonna be late. Let's go.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.550
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.
Miranda...

20:18.634 --> 20:21.095
Okay, here's the thing.

20:21.178 --> 20:26.142
I am so sorry,
but we don't actually have a...

20:30.730 --> 20:33.190
long walk!
Because we're here already.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.485
[sighs]

20:39.864 --> 20:43.576
[man on TV] <i>Her artistic style transformed</i>
<i>over the course of her life.</i>

20:43.659 --> 20:47.121
<i>During her darkest days, she experimented</i>
<i>with brush-loading techniques</i>

20:47.204 --> 20:48.956
<i>to add texture to the canvas.</i>

<i>In her late twenties, diagnosed with...</i>

20:51.834 --> 20:53.627
[Keith] How's your neck doing?

20:53.710 --> 20:56.881
Oh, well, it's a little lonely. [chuckles]

20:56.964 --> 20:59.759
Because I noticed you haven't
been wearing your brace.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.428
You probably shouldn't
strain yourself, right?

21:02.511 --> 21:05.306
Well, I... I haven't been
feeling any pain there.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.349
Mmm. Feel harder?

21:07.433 --> 21:10.186
Wouldn't it be a little better
with a little support?

21:11.228 --> 21:12.646
Yeah, I guess.

21:12.729 --> 21:13.981
-Perfect.
-[chuckles]

21:14.065 --> 21:15.107
I'll get it for you.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.692
Okay, thanks.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.031
Mom.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.700
I know, he's great.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.286
Yeah. I mean, I'm just...
I'm just, like, surprised.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.996
This is really, really fun.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.081
Yeah.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.876
Oh, shoot. You know,
I put the neck thing in the bottom drawer,

21:33.960 --> 21:35.711
so he's gonna have a hard time finding it.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.839
No, oh, uh, I'll show him.
I'll show him.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.924
-Thank you.
-Yep.

[sniffing]

21:50.559 --> 21:51.727
Um...

21:52.478 --> 21:54.438
did you just sniff Mom's neck brace?

21:55.314 --> 21:56.315
No.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.860
I just saw you.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.612
You don't know what you saw.

22:03.697 --> 22:04.949
Okeydokey.

22:21.548 --> 22:25.344
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where I can find the manager, please?

22:27.138 --> 22:29.681
If we put the doors
back on the bathroom stalls,

22:29.765 --> 22:30.807
just put those back on...

22:30.892 --> 22:32.894
[sighs and chuckles]

22:32.977 --> 22:35.687
There you are! Oh, well.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.689
You look exactly like I thought you'd look

22:37.773 --> 22:40.151
based on all the conversations
that we've been having

22:40.234 --> 22:41.944
on the phone lately. [chuckles]

22:42.028 --> 22:45.990
I'm... I'm sorry. Can I...
Is there... Uh, how can I help you?

22:46.073 --> 22:49.994
Yes, I am here
with YouTube sensation Miranda Sings,

22:50.077 --> 22:53.164
and we are going to win that...

22:53.247 --> 22:55.624
hundred bucks tonight.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.961
Oh, okay.
Well, good luck.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.713
Oh, what's this?

23:01.797 --> 23:04.800

Yeah, see that?
I told you we'd hit the big time.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.042
Okay, we need to hurry this up.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.669
I think that manish lady-person
wants to kill me.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.338
What's the plan?

23:42.421 --> 23:45.382
Uh... well, you're performing
up there on this glass stage,

23:45.466 --> 23:47.384
and I think... and I think people...

23:48.510 --> 23:50.054
I think people
are gonna see up your skirt.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.805
[Jim gasps] Patrick!

23:51.888 --> 23:53.932
I'm worried about protecting your honor.

23:54.016 --> 23:57.144
Who cares about my honor?
Everyone's gonna see my tookie!

23:57.228 --> 23:58.937
Okay, everyone remain calm.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.564
We will think of something.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.068
Stay right there, all right?
No peeking now.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.236
-No peeking.
-[Bethany] All right. Okay, okay.

24:05.319 --> 24:06.362
-I'm not peeking.
-[Keith] Almost done.

[Keith] And now!

24:14.953 --> 24:17.373

It's for you to get around.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.459
-Oh.
-But her legs work fine.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.086
-Oh, come here. Have a seat.
-Okay.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.297
Have a seat. I think we should let
Bethany decide if her legs work or not.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.382
Because they don't.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.384
Hey, Mom, are you hearing this?

24:29.093 --> 24:31.720
Well, honey, you know,
sometimes my legs get very tired

24:31.803 --> 24:34.056
when I'm standing for,
like, a long time.

24:35.224 --> 24:39.311
Yeah, so why don't you...
ride that nice and slow for me?

Oh, oh.
Gosh, it's got a sharp turn on it, huh?

24:46.152 --> 24:48.112
[Keith] Uh-huh, take your time.
Whoa, easy. Oh.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.614
-Don't hurt nothing. All right.
-[both chuckle]

24:50.697 --> 24:52.991
-Look at you in that. Mmm-hmm.
-[Bethany] Okay.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.619
[Bethany] Think I got it.
[Keith] Ooh. Yeah, uh-huh.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.995
[Jim] Don't worry, Miranda.

24:57.079 --> 24:58.747
No one is gonna see your tookie.

24:58.830 --> 25:02.418
This is my gift to you.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.337
-[Miranda] Okay. But what about you?
-Don't worry about me.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.964
Wait, Uncle Jim,
I can see your entire naked legs.

25:08.049 --> 25:10.509
You're being completely porn.
You need to go hide right now.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.677
Okay.

25:12.386 --> 25:13.970
Hey...

25:14.055 --> 25:15.889
these are really comfortable.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.392
They fit me so well in all the places.

-I knew this day would come.
<i>-Okay, okay. But listen.</i>

We need to get rid of Keith,
and you're the best person I know

25:31.530 --> 25:32.989
at getting rid of people.
So I need you to come home--

25:33.074 --> 25:34.908
You know what?
I warned you, Emily.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.744

I think he has a fetish for sick people.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.209
Okay, well,
you brought this on yourself.

25:43.292 --> 25:46.128
Oh, and by the way, tell Mom
that I'm having a great time without her

25:46.212 --> 25:48.547
and I don't miss her at all.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.048

<i>Hello?</i>

25:51.717 --> 25:53.427
Oh, Emily.
Thank goodness you called.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.761
What's wrong?

25:54.845 --> 25:57.348
The car got impounded, Miranda's
in a fight with a big, beautiful lady,

25:57.431 --> 25:59.391
and we need you to come
pick us up and, uh,

25:59.475 --> 26:00.892
can you bring some pants for Uncle Jim?

26:00.976 --> 26:02.811
Because he's not wearing any.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.314
Interesting.
Where are you?

26:05.981 --> 26:07.733

All right. Our last act of the night is...

30:41.089 --> 30:44.259
Okay, wow.
Just... just... Just wow.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.594
Well, I think we can all agree

30:45.677 --> 30:49.014
what the most entertaining act
of the evening was.

30:49.097 --> 30:53.852
The $100 prize goes
to the comedy trio from Tacoma.

30:53.935 --> 30:56.605
-[crowd applauding]
-Thank you, thank you.

30:56.688 --> 31:00.233
-This is a wonderful life moment for me.
-What? Comedy trio?

31:00.316 --> 31:01.568
No, I'm a solo act.

31:01.652 --> 31:04.405
No, we don't accept
your stupid check, okay?

31:05.321 --> 31:06.573
[grunts]

31:07.658 --> 31:09.451
Okay. We don't want it.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.911
Thanks for nothing.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.708
Thank you, though.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.001
Thank you.

31:18.085 --> 31:20.504

-[cheering]

31:20.587 --> 31:22.130
[chuckles]

31:22.213 --> 31:24.591
Oh, Miranda? Miranda?

31:31.264 --> 31:32.433
[Jim] Uh-huh.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.685
That's the idea.
Just a few more windows

31:34.768 --> 31:37.396
and I'll be able to drive
this baby back home.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.776
Where's your stupid boyfriend?

31:43.944 --> 31:45.696
He's gone.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.448
[glass shattering]

31:55.997 --> 31:57.373
[Jim] I can't believe this.

31:57.458 --> 32:02.546
I made this trip turn out even more
perfectly than I could have imagined.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.548
[sighs]

32:06.341 --> 32:07.759
Winners.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.970
We're all winners.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.139
