37:27.620 --> 37:28.828
Carving your own way.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.665
-Well, thanks. I try.
-I see big things in your future.

37:31.832 --> 37:36.753
Maybe even Senior VP,
Eastern Great Lakes Division.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.839
Don't get me wrong,
you'll have to work for it.

37:40.049 --> 37:42.175
Seven days a week, lunch at your desk.

37:42.343 --> 37:46.513
But in eight to 10 short years,
that could be you.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.312
Well, thank you. Thank you, sir.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.981
It's, um....

37:57.942 --> 37:59.609
But...

38:00.111 --> 38:03.071
...I am giving my notice.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.492
This is a joke. You're kidding me, right?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.121
No. I've--

38:11.497 --> 38:12.622
I recently--

38:12.790 --> 38:16.668
Very recently realized that
I have some other work I have to do.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.296
It's very important to me.

38:20.381 --> 38:25.051
-Other work? Another company?
-No, I-- It's hard to explain.

38:26.053 --> 38:28.680
It's just that this--

38:28.848 --> 38:31.057
This is-- It's just--

38:34.020 --> 38:35.645
It's not who I'm supposed to be.

38:40.568 --> 38:44.487
-What?
-Dean, Dean, Dean.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.406
Finally.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.412
The hell?

38:53.247 --> 38:56.541
Why am I wearing a tie?
My God, am I hungry.

38:57.251 --> 38:58.710
Welcome back.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.421
Wait. Did I--?

39:03.424 --> 39:04.758
Did I just get touched by--?

39:04.925 --> 39:07.177
-You're an angel, aren't you?
-I'm Zachariah.

39:07.345 --> 39:11.097
Oh, great. That's all I need
is another one of you guys.

39:11.265 --> 39:14.267
I'm hardly another one, Dean.
I'm Castiel's superior.

39:14.435 --> 39:19.272
Believe me, I had no interest in popping
here into one of these smelly things.

39:19.774 --> 39:23.193
But after the unfortunate situation
with Uriel...

39:23.361 --> 39:25.403
...I felt it necessary to pay a visit.

39:25.571 --> 39:28.615
-Get my ducks in a row.
-I am not one of your ducks.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.575
Starting with your attitude.

39:32.536 --> 39:35.914
Oh, so, what?
This was all some sort of a lesson?

39:36.082 --> 39:38.625
Is that what you're telling me? Wow.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.294
-Very creative.
-You should see my decoupage.

39:42.963 --> 39:45.882
Gross. No, thank you.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.469
So, what? I'm just hallucinating all this?
Is that it?

39:49.678 --> 39:52.472
Not at all. Real place, real haunting.

39:52.640 --> 39:56.059
Just plunked you in the middle
without the benefit of your memories.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.061
Just to shake things up?

39:58.229 --> 40:02.399
So you can have fun watching us run
around like ass clowns in monkey suits?

40:02.566 --> 40:06.820
To prove to you that the path you're on
is truly in your blood. You're a hunter.

40:06.987 --> 40:10.323
Not because your dad made you, not
because God called you back from hell.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.826
But because it is what you are.

40:13.285 --> 40:17.163
You love it. You find your way to it in
the dark and you're miserable without it.

40:17.331 --> 40:19.958
Dean, let's be real here.
You're good at this.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.293
You'll be successful. You will stop it.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.505
Stop what?

40:25.798 --> 40:29.676
The apocalypse, huh?
Lucifer? What? Be specific, man.

40:29.844 --> 40:33.138
You'll do everything
you're destined to do. All of it.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.850
But I know, I know.

40:37.017 --> 40:39.644
You're not strong enough, you're scared.

40:39.812 --> 40:42.188
You got daddy issues.
You can't do it. Right?

40:42.356 --> 40:44.357
Angel or not, I will stab you in your face.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.528
All I'm saying is...

40:48.737 --> 40:50.697
...it's how you look at it.

40:50.865 --> 40:54.701
Most folks live and die without moving
more than the dirt it takes to bury them.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.494
You get to change things.

40:56.662 --> 41:00.623
Save people, maybe even the world.

41:00.791 --> 41:03.877
All the while you drive a classic car
and fornicate with women.

41:04.044 --> 41:07.505
This isn't a curse, it's a gift.

41:08.382 --> 41:12.010
So for God's sakes, Dean,
quit whining about it.

41:13.637 --> 41:14.679
Look around.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.225
There are plenty of fates
worse than yours.

41:25.024 --> 41:26.900
So are you with me?

41:27.359 --> 41:30.487
You wanna go steam yourself
another latte?

41:31.197 --> 41:33.323
Or are you ready to stand up...

41:35.576 --> 41:37.577
...and be who you really are?
