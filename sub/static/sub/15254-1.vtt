10:29.448 --> 10:32.249
Access the accounts,
get my money.

10:32.284 --> 10:33.851
Yes, we ride
at midnight.

10:33.885 --> 10:35.202
His security is deadly.

10:36.621 --> 10:38.823
So maybe, maybe we, we ride
first thing in the morning.

10:38.857 --> 10:40.024
- No need to rush.
- That's probably a better idea.

10:40.042 --> 10:41.859
Twenty percent

10:41.893 --> 10:44.762
of what you recover is yours.

10:47.432 --> 10:48.933
Fifty.

10:50.369 --> 10:51.669
Done some digging
on you, Woodley.

10:51.703 --> 10:54.105
You're just an ambulance
chaser, trial lawyer,

10:54.139 --> 10:55.106
scum of the earth.

10:55.140 --> 10:56.774
Uh! He's kidding.

10:56.808 --> 10:58.509
He's kidding.
He's only kidding.

10:58.543 --> 11:00.878
Casey, Bale is worth
infiltrating anyway.

11:00.912 --> 11:02.747
Looks like he's stolen money
from teachers' unions

11:02.781 --> 11:04.915
and families.

11:04.950 --> 11:07.518
He stole $2 million
from Rush Limbaugh.

11:07.552 --> 11:11.522
Tell me everything you know
about this animal.

11:14.126 --> 11:16.577
<i>He's throwing himself a party</i>
<i>tomorrow night--</i>

11:16.611 --> 11:19.063
<i>his going-away--</i>
<i>but it's strictly invite,</i>

11:19.097 --> 11:21.899
<i>and everything goes</i>
<i>through his secure Blackberry.</i>

11:21.933 --> 11:23.701
What a complete tool.

11:23.735 --> 11:25.753
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
on the Bluetooth,

11:25.787 --> 11:26.837
all day-- how rude.

11:26.872 --> 11:27.938
I'm getting

11:27.973 --> 11:29.256
a really good feed
from the satellite.

11:29.291 --> 11:30.941
The party's being set up,
and the place

11:30.976 --> 11:32.009
looks like a fortress.

11:32.044 --> 11:33.210
See? I told you satellite

11:33.245 --> 11:34.211
was a good investment.

11:34.246 --> 11:35.312
We just got to figure out

11:35.347 --> 11:36.547
a way to get into his PDA

11:36.581 --> 11:39.083
and invite ourselves
to this party.

11:39.101 --> 11:41.135
Let's talk
house, homeboy.

11:41.186 --> 11:42.136
What was that?

11:42.187 --> 11:43.137
Did you say house?

11:43.188 --> 11:44.254
Nothing, n-nothing, Sarah.

11:44.272 --> 11:45.556
Just hopping off real quick.

11:48.427 --> 11:49.994
The house is secret, remember?

11:50.028 --> 11:52.563
The only secret,
the only real secret

11:52.597 --> 11:54.231
is gonna be which room
you're sleeping in.

11:54.265 --> 11:56.433
Why? 17 of 'em!

11:56.451 --> 11:59.303
Swimming pool, screening room,
bowling alley, gourmet kitchen,

11:59.337 --> 12:01.122
second... bowling alley,

12:01.156 --> 12:02.773
and it's on the beach.

12:02.808 --> 12:05.076
I mean, it's crazy, but...

12:05.110 --> 12:06.744
Hey, toes in the sand.

12:06.778 --> 12:08.045
Toes in the sand.
Toes in...

12:08.080 --> 12:09.380
Toes in the sand!

12:09.414 --> 12:12.299
Could you imagine how awesome
this would be, buddy?

12:12.334 --> 12:14.668
I mean, to give Sarah
the dream life?

12:14.719 --> 12:16.587
Owning her own company,
living in the dream home,

12:16.621 --> 12:18.305
a place that we
can call our own.

12:18.340 --> 12:20.624
We just need
this gig to pay out.

12:20.659 --> 12:22.960
I know.

12:22.978 --> 12:24.345
One second.

12:32.170 --> 12:34.171
Chuck, why don't we just nab

12:34.206 --> 12:35.673
this guy's phone
while he's playing squash?

12:35.707 --> 12:37.992
Huh?
I just zoomed on his gym bag.

12:38.026 --> 12:39.326
Okay? Kensington Athletic.

12:39.361 --> 12:40.845
It's, like a super
exclusive squash club.

12:40.879 --> 12:42.163
He's got to have
a regular game, right?

12:42.197 --> 12:43.831
Morgan, that's fantastic.

12:43.865 --> 12:46.150
Fantastic!

12:46.184 --> 12:47.118
Zoomed?

12:47.152 --> 12:48.486
Did you say you... what?

12:48.520 --> 12:50.855
Did you... you said
you zoomed on his gym bag?

12:50.889 --> 12:52.173
Yes, yeah, because
you had "flash,"

12:52.207 --> 12:53.791
which was
great, but...

12:53.825 --> 12:55.292
mmm... I kind of want
to do my own thing,

12:55.326 --> 12:57.027
mix it up a little bit,
so I came up with zoom.

12:58.330 --> 12:59.880
You don't like it.
Ah, you don't like it.

12:59.931 --> 13:00.881
No, hey, hey--

13:00.932 --> 13:02.733
"zoom" it is, buddy. You know.

13:02.767 --> 13:03.968
Whatever you want.

13:04.002 --> 13:05.686
Really?
You're-you're amazing.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.139
You are so Zen right now.
If I had a power like that

13:08.173 --> 13:09.440
and I thought
it was gone forever,

13:09.474 --> 13:10.558
aw, Chuck, I'd be a wreck.

13:10.609 --> 13:13.210
Whew! But not you,
man, you are my hero.

13:13.245 --> 13:15.846
You're great even
without the Intersect.

13:20.018 --> 13:22.820
How certain are you
that these glasses

13:22.854 --> 13:25.322
only had one reload
left in them?

13:25.357 --> 13:28.792
Like...
very certain.

13:28.827 --> 13:30.194
I tried to access

13:30.228 --> 13:33.364
the program, but there
was no way to update it.

13:33.398 --> 13:37.201
This version of the Intersect
is a one-time deal-- I'm sorry.

13:40.088 --> 13:41.772
That's okay.
That's okay.

13:41.806 --> 13:43.040
Morgan's got it now,

13:43.058 --> 13:46.060
and he's doing
surprisingly well, so...

13:47.445 --> 13:49.914
Chuck, what's wrong?

13:50.949 --> 13:53.150
The Intersect

13:53.185 --> 13:55.152
opened me up
to big dreams.

13:55.187 --> 13:57.855
But in order for those
dreams to become a reality,

13:57.889 --> 14:01.592
I need this business
to succeed, and...

14:01.626 --> 14:02.993
You think the company
doesn't work

14:03.028 --> 14:04.361
if you don't have the Intersect?

14:06.264 --> 14:07.565
Yeah.

14:07.599 --> 14:11.252
Chuck, I don't think that Dad
wanted you to have

14:11.286 --> 14:12.753
the Intersect forever.

14:12.787 --> 14:15.606
And besides,
you don't need it.

14:16.775 --> 14:18.776
The computer
didn't make you a hero,

14:18.810 --> 14:21.779
it just gave you
an opportunity to become one.

14:21.813 --> 14:24.281
Now it's up to you.

14:24.316 --> 14:26.183
The training wheels are off,
you're gonna fall down,

14:26.218 --> 14:28.786
but I promise you...
you can do this.

14:31.790 --> 14:33.958
My two cents.

14:35.393 --> 14:37.444
Thanks, sis.

14:37.479 --> 14:40.281
I needed a good
Ellie speech.

14:40.315 --> 14:42.283
Well, what are sisters for?

14:58.088 --> 15:01.140
The mission, is to
access Roger Bale's PDA

15:01.206 --> 15:03.891
and put ourselves on the guest
list for his party tonight.

15:03.892 --> 15:06.260
The phone is gonna be
difficult to get to,

15:06.294 --> 15:08.862
and password-protected
when we do.

15:08.897 --> 15:10.430
Bale has bodyguards;
could be trouble.

15:10.465 --> 15:13.199
And that's why you're the one
going for the phone, Casey.

15:13.218 --> 15:14.334
This plug-in

15:14.369 --> 15:15.836
will cut through
all the encryption

15:15.870 --> 15:18.272
and install a virus that
will send me an invite.

15:18.306 --> 15:20.107
Bale is playing
in a club

15:20.141 --> 15:21.875
squash tournament.
Morgan,

15:21.910 --> 15:23.877
you're gonna delay his
opponent while I step in

15:23.895 --> 15:25.545
and match up with Bale.

15:25.563 --> 15:27.581
He'll get to know my face
and name so that when

15:27.615 --> 15:29.716
I show up at the party,
I won't be a complete stranger.

15:29.734 --> 15:32.753
What? What-what-what,
what's the problem? What's up?

15:32.787 --> 15:35.756
You're gonna play?
Do you actually

15:35.790 --> 15:37.958
play any non-video game sports?

15:37.992 --> 15:39.443
Yeah, I played
some racquetball.

15:39.494 --> 15:42.062
I think I can fake
squash for half an hour.

15:43.097 --> 15:45.265
No, Chuck,
I don't think so.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.967
I... Sarah.

15:48.937 --> 15:50.454
Uh... well,

15:50.488 --> 15:52.906
sweetheart, um...

15:52.941 --> 15:56.043
you know, I-I think what, um...

15:56.077 --> 15:57.210
Let's put Grimes
on the court.

15:57.245 --> 15:59.046
He can zoom on squash,
give the guy a game.

16:00.081 --> 16:01.615
"Zoom," Casey?

16:01.649 --> 16:03.116
It'll buy me some time.

16:03.151 --> 16:04.217
You delay his opponent,

16:04.252 --> 16:05.719
take over the job
I was gonna do.

16:05.753 --> 16:07.921
It'll be great, right?
What was the job I was gonna do?

16:11.592 --> 16:12.793
Yeah...

16:12.827 --> 16:13.927
Oof...

16:13.962 --> 16:15.261
I think I'm
supposed to be

16:15.280 --> 16:17.564
playing my game right now.
You sure it's only 2:00?

16:17.598 --> 16:20.767
Oh, Mr. Burnham,
you just sit here and relax.

16:20.802 --> 16:22.970
I will tell you when it's time.

16:23.004 --> 16:24.621
And right now, it is...

16:24.656 --> 16:25.989
not time.

16:29.744 --> 16:31.328
Bale's coming.

16:31.379 --> 16:33.013
Casey, he's headed your way.

16:33.047 --> 16:36.350
Morgan, get ready,
he'll be there in a minute.

16:36.384 --> 16:37.617
Yep.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.521
Chuck, you keep
that bear on that table,

16:41.556 --> 16:42.723
or this all falls apart.

16:42.757 --> 16:43.924
Remember,

16:43.958 --> 16:46.493
I like it deep... and hard.

16:47.528 --> 16:48.629
That's great.

16:48.663 --> 16:50.330
That just sounds great.

16:55.403 --> 16:57.137
Hey, man, sorry
for the delay.

16:57.155 --> 17:00.190
I had a hot tub
full of nursing students.

17:00.241 --> 17:02.526
- They're so chatty.
- Totally.

17:02.577 --> 17:04.678
So, you must be

17:04.712 --> 17:05.679
Killer Burnham?

17:05.713 --> 17:06.780
He's a no-show.

17:06.814 --> 17:07.814
I'm Michael Carmichael

17:07.848 --> 17:08.815
of Michael Carmichael
Industries,

17:08.833 --> 17:09.849
a subsidiary of MikeCo.

17:09.884 --> 17:11.785
That sounds like big money.

17:11.819 --> 17:13.819
Mmm, you have no idea.

17:13.855 --> 17:16.289
You know, if was standing
on my wallet...

17:16.323 --> 17:17.790
I'd be tall.

17:17.825 --> 17:18.842
Yeah.

17:18.876 --> 17:19.893
Your skin is...

17:19.926 --> 17:21.127
soft to the touch.

17:21.162 --> 17:22.295
There you go.

17:22.329 --> 17:23.829
Is that a
waxing situation?

17:23.865 --> 17:25.632
My wife's talked to me
about waxing, but...

17:25.665 --> 17:27.500
I'm not really a big fan
of physical contact.

17:27.518 --> 17:28.902
Outside of my job, of course.

17:28.936 --> 17:30.837
This is what I do every day.

17:35.526 --> 17:37.911
Hey, uh, your ball warm?

17:39.147 --> 17:40.346
Here we go.

17:46.404 --> 17:48.872
Amigo, my ball is...

17:48.906 --> 17:50.157
red-hot.

17:53.695 --> 17:55.028
You're pretty quick.

17:55.046 --> 17:56.413
"Sneaky quick," they call that.

17:56.464 --> 17:57.998
Ooh! Sneaky quick.

18:04.605 --> 18:05.839
Put a little elbow
grease into it.

18:05.873 --> 18:07.841
Oh, yeah? Should I do that?

18:07.875 --> 18:09.559
There you go.
There it is.

18:09.594 --> 18:10.877
Almost there.

18:10.912 --> 18:13.380
Almost there.

18:13.414 --> 18:14.681
Little deeper.

18:14.716 --> 18:15.882
You know...

18:15.900 --> 18:18.085
you are a thick man.

18:18.119 --> 18:19.786
Yeah... right there.

18:19.821 --> 18:20.954
There it is.

18:20.988 --> 18:22.556
Come on.

18:27.061 --> 18:30.030
Turn and reach,
you old son of a bitch.

18:30.064 --> 18:32.866
Hey, Chuck, we got a problem.

18:32.900 --> 18:33.934
Casey's caught up
getting Bale's phone.

18:33.968 --> 18:35.102
Maybe I can tranq my guy

18:35.136 --> 18:36.236
and give Casey an assist.

18:39.791 --> 18:41.341
- So, let me ask you a question.
- Yes, sir.

18:41.375 --> 18:44.111
This guy you're supposed
to play, Jim Burnham,

18:44.145 --> 18:46.213
you called him something else.

18:46.247 --> 18:47.380
Killer.

18:47.414 --> 18:48.882
Heard he killed
nine men

18:48.916 --> 18:50.083
in the Foreign Legion.

18:50.101 --> 18:51.218
The name stuck.

18:51.252 --> 18:53.753
Mm, only nine, huh?

18:56.324 --> 18:57.324
What the hell?

18:57.358 --> 18:58.859
No, no, somebody's
not relaxing!

18:58.893 --> 19:00.560
Relax, breathe, breathe.

19:00.594 --> 19:01.594
I just dropped
something.

19:01.612 --> 19:02.779
Oil's slippery.

19:06.868 --> 19:08.452
John Casey.

19:08.486 --> 19:10.270
I knew you'd fall
for that old line.

19:10.304 --> 19:11.972
I haven't seen you
since jump school.

19:13.174 --> 19:14.574
Stark.

19:14.608 --> 19:15.976
Been a while.

19:16.010 --> 19:16.793
Breathe.

19:16.828 --> 19:18.328
Is that a gun?

19:18.379 --> 19:20.613
I am gonna rip

19:20.631 --> 19:21.948
your head off!

19:22.984 --> 19:24.151
What's a leatherneck like you

19:24.185 --> 19:25.452
doing in the Kensington Club?

19:25.486 --> 19:26.987
Private security.

19:27.021 --> 19:29.156
Me, too.
For a turd named Bale.

19:29.190 --> 19:31.658
Real scuzzer, but at
least it's a payday.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.127
I don't have to sell
you on selling out.

19:34.162 --> 19:37.030
Guy with your skills, Casey,
you've got to be raking it in.

19:43.504 --> 19:45.272
Ah!

19:46.808 --> 19:50.210
You think one little dart
is gonna drop 400 pounds

19:50.244 --> 19:51.545
of solid meat?

20:02.657 --> 20:03.707
You seem like a...

20:03.758 --> 20:06.793
moderately successful
individual.

20:06.827 --> 20:08.895
♪ ♪

20:12.099 --> 20:13.666
Let's say a fella

31:11.086 --> 31:12.236
No, no, no, no. No, no.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.054
Do not do that.
You're gonna zoom too soon.

31:14.072 --> 31:16.557
Premature zoom? Really? Crap!

31:16.592 --> 31:18.392
Okay, okay, what do I do?

31:18.427 --> 31:20.495
Think about baseball.

31:20.529 --> 31:22.130
Baseball.

31:22.164 --> 31:25.566
Why baseball? I mean, come on.
It is so boring.

31:25.601 --> 31:28.736
I mean, just pitch
the damn ball already!

31:28.771 --> 31:31.272
And enough talk
with the statistics!

31:31.306 --> 31:32.874
Chuck, do you know what
a slugging percentage is?

31:32.908 --> 31:34.475
'Cause I don't know what a
slugging percentage is,

31:34.510 --> 31:35.643
all right? And honestly,

31:35.677 --> 31:37.879
who the hell cares?!

31:39.181 --> 31:41.432
All right, that worked.
Thank you, buddy.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.917
Thank you. I'm good.

31:42.951 --> 31:45.920
Perhaps I can show you
around the gardens outside.

31:45.938 --> 31:49.256
They are modeled after the
pleasure gardens of Italy.

31:49.274 --> 31:52.894
Well, the pleasure
would be all mine.

31:52.928 --> 31:54.929
You're a good girl.

31:58.116 --> 31:59.617
What a slime bag.

31:59.651 --> 32:00.968
- Mm.
- Excellent work,

32:01.003 --> 32:02.270
everybody.

32:02.304 --> 32:03.905
Casey is on his way
to the computer vault.

32:03.939 --> 32:05.506
Morgan, Sarah, distraction time.

32:05.541 --> 32:07.842
All righty, Chuck. Am I up?

32:07.876 --> 32:10.178
Oh, you are up, buddy.
Zoom away.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.170
I like that.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.791
Sarah?

32:34.486 --> 32:36.971
Let me show you
how it's done.

32:37.005 --> 32:39.607
♪ ♪

33:01.763 --> 33:03.698
Nice work, Morgan.

33:18.547 --> 33:19.914
We're in.

33:19.948 --> 33:22.817
Bingo. Now, once all
the accounts are downloaded,

33:22.851 --> 33:26.520
we can reroute them
to the original investors.

33:27.856 --> 33:30.758
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What's happening?

33:32.361 --> 33:34.028
Decker.

33:34.062 --> 33:35.429
Hello, Chuck.

33:35.464 --> 33:36.597
What are you doing?

33:36.632 --> 33:38.032
I'm using your computer

33:38.066 --> 33:40.384
to access Bale's accounts
and freeze them.

33:40.419 --> 33:41.869
No. No, no, no, no, no.

33:41.904 --> 33:44.205
You're gonna trigger the alarm.
My people are still inside.

33:44.239 --> 33:45.673
<i>Yo</i> people?

33:45.707 --> 33:47.091
Cute.

33:59.821 --> 34:02.690
Listen, I know you lied to me,
I know I'm not part

34:02.724 --> 34:05.092
of your bigger plan,
whatever the hell that is, okay?

34:05.127 --> 34:07.028
You've won. Now let us go.

34:07.062 --> 34:09.996
Payback's a bitch, Charlie.

34:11.867 --> 34:14.068
No... Guys, guys,
get out of there!

34:14.085 --> 34:15.202
Mr. Carmichael?

34:18.090 --> 34:21.542
Darling, I know what you
did with my key card.

34:21.576 --> 34:23.577
Come with me now,
or I will kill you

34:23.594 --> 34:25.813
in front of all
of my friends.

34:25.847 --> 34:28.849
Uh-uh. I think actually
what's gonna happen is,

34:28.884 --> 34:30.751
I'm gonna open up
a big can of--

34:33.804 --> 34:35.139
Come with us.
What?

34:37.425 --> 34:39.259
Come with me, Colonel.
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:39.277 --> 34:42.730
You used to be
a colonel.

34:42.764 --> 34:45.599
Morgan, Sarah, Casey, please,
tell me what's happening.

34:59.348 --> 35:01.916
I'm locked out of the accounts!
What have you done?

35:01.950 --> 35:04.218
Do anything to us, and
you'll never have access

35:04.252 --> 35:06.420
to those accounts ever again.

35:06.455 --> 35:08.456
You see, we work with somebody.

35:08.490 --> 35:10.358
A master spy

35:10.392 --> 35:12.360
who always
has a plan.

35:12.394 --> 35:13.894
Okay. Okay, this isn't good.

35:13.929 --> 35:15.496
No plan, no plan.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.264
The master spy
does not have a plan.

35:17.299 --> 35:19.266
Uh, I don't want
to hear her voice anymore.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.135
Take 'em all downstairs.
I'll decide what

35:21.153 --> 35:22.353
to do with them later.

35:22.404 --> 35:24.005
I need you

35:24.039 --> 35:25.806
to get somebody from
our computer team

35:25.841 --> 35:26.974
on the phone <i>right now!</i>

35:27.009 --> 35:28.142
Yes, sir.

35:28.176 --> 35:29.443
I think I have a plan.

35:35.584 --> 35:39.020
Computer emergency?

35:46.864 --> 35:47.909
What's wrong with it?

35:47.983 --> 35:50.285
An outside computer
is accessing your system.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.321
You're under attack.

35:52.355 --> 35:53.989
Don't worry.
I cut into the attack,

35:54.023 --> 35:55.340
and your accounts
are still here.

35:55.375 --> 35:57.442
- Is it fixed?
- Yeppers.

35:57.477 --> 35:58.794
Get rid of him.

35:58.828 --> 36:00.379
Huh? Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

36:00.430 --> 36:01.830
What's happening?
I'm just the IT guy.

36:01.864 --> 36:03.865
You saw some things you
weren't supposed to see.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.201
And I don't like your face.
Kill him.

36:06.235 --> 36:07.235
Then the others.

36:07.270 --> 36:08.670
I'd think twice
about that, Bale!

36:10.373 --> 36:14.142
I pull these wires,
your firewall goes down,

36:14.177 --> 36:16.645
and the CIA is inside of you
in seconds.

36:17.847 --> 36:19.314
Your computer.

36:19.349 --> 36:21.683
Inside of your computer
in seconds.

36:21.718 --> 36:22.751
Who are you?

36:22.785 --> 36:25.320
Carmichael.

36:25.355 --> 36:27.322
Charles Carmichael.

36:27.357 --> 36:29.925
I have your brother Michael.

36:29.959 --> 36:33.061
I know, and you're gonna
let him and the others go.

36:33.096 --> 36:35.030
I so much
as sneeze, and,

36:35.064 --> 36:38.900
well, you lose
all your money.

36:38.935 --> 36:41.086
Oh!

36:41.137 --> 36:44.072
Oops. That was about ten million
bucks right there, Rog.

36:45.842 --> 36:47.409
Let 'em go.

36:50.179 --> 36:52.647
What the hell is going on?

36:52.682 --> 36:55.417
You're free to go.

36:55.451 --> 36:58.620
Hey, Chuck? Chuck,
can you hear me? Where are you?

36:58.654 --> 37:00.489
- Sarah, you outside?
- Yeah.

37:00.523 --> 37:02.107
They let us go.
Are you still inside?

37:03.159 --> 37:05.227
Don't worry about me. Just go.

37:05.261 --> 37:07.079
No, I'm-I'm not going anywhere.

37:07.113 --> 37:08.246
Sarah, you, Casey and Morgan,

37:08.281 --> 37:10.065
get in the van
and leave right now.

37:10.099 --> 37:11.233
Did I do great?

37:11.267 --> 37:12.417
Shut up, moron.

37:12.452 --> 37:14.970
Chuck, I am not leaving
my husband on a mission.

37:15.004 --> 37:17.739
Sarah... Sarah, I'm sorry.

37:19.008 --> 37:20.976
I wanted to buy you the house.

37:21.010 --> 37:23.578
I wanted to give you the future
that you've always dreamed of.

37:23.613 --> 37:25.931
But more than that,
I want you to live.

37:25.965 --> 37:27.182
Come on.
What?

37:27.216 --> 37:28.417
Don't make me die in vain.

37:28.451 --> 37:30.018
Leave me behind.

37:30.052 --> 37:31.686
Get in the van.

37:31.721 --> 37:33.522
Leave. Leave me behind!

37:35.224 --> 37:37.091
Casey, we can't just
leave him behind like that.

37:37.110 --> 37:38.160
Please, leave!

37:40.730 --> 37:44.265
Guys, please don't leave me
behind! I have a plan.

37:44.283 --> 37:47.102
Your friends are safe,
but you're stuck here.

37:47.136 --> 37:48.570
What were
you thinking?

37:48.604 --> 37:50.338
Actually, I was thinking fast.

37:50.373 --> 37:51.807
Listen, there's-there's a button
on the control panel.

37:51.841 --> 37:53.325
Hit that button.

37:53.376 --> 37:55.477
I just hope
they got my message.

38:09.025 --> 38:11.026
Morgan, disconnect us from
the building's electrical line.

38:11.060 --> 38:13.128
Casey, get the van moving.

38:13.162 --> 38:15.129
Sarah, there's
a rather large window

38:15.148 --> 38:16.565
on the east side
of the building.

38:16.599 --> 38:18.433
It's the only way out...

38:18.468 --> 38:20.168
so I'm going
to be jumping through it.

38:20.203 --> 38:22.637
Casey, east side of the
building-- go, go, go, go!

38:42.875 --> 38:47.045
<i>And Sarah,</i>
<i>no matter what happens,</i>

38:47.096 --> 38:49.598
I love you.

39:01.527 --> 39:04.079
Ow! Ooh!

39:04.113 --> 39:06.531
<i>Also, if at all possible,</i>
<i>if you could check</i>

39:06.566 --> 39:08.517
to make sure
I'm still alive on the roof

39:08.551 --> 39:10.051
of the van, that would be great.

39:11.904 --> 39:12.921
Good work, Chuck!

39:12.955 --> 39:14.089
Thanks, honey.

39:14.123 --> 39:16.241
Hey, dude, that
was awesome!

39:23.499 --> 39:26.301
Listen, guys, team,
let's-let's...

39:26.335 --> 39:28.086
let's not get down, okay?

39:28.137 --> 39:30.472
Yes, that was not a classically
successful mission,

39:30.506 --> 39:32.841
but, you know,
we all made it out alive,

39:32.875 --> 39:34.543
uh, so-so, that-that's a plus.

39:34.577 --> 39:37.379
And the news says
that Bale was arrested, so,

39:37.413 --> 39:40.248
I think we should put that
in the win category.

39:40.283 --> 39:42.250
Win, uh, win
with an asterisk maybe.

39:43.486 --> 39:44.986
It's not that, Chuck.

39:45.021 --> 39:47.722
Well, okay, what is it then?

39:49.742 --> 39:51.893
Decker froze
Bale's accounts,

39:51.928 --> 39:54.329
which included the money
we transferred in.

39:54.363 --> 39:57.465
Castle and the Buy More are the
only things that aren't frozen.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.467
Decker froze

39:59.502 --> 40:00.785
all of our money

40:00.836 --> 40:02.787
because he tracked
our deposit back to us.

40:02.838 --> 40:04.806
Wait.

40:04.840 --> 40:06.841
Wait. What?

40:06.876 --> 40:09.277
All of our... all of our money?

40:09.312 --> 40:10.478
We have nothing?

40:10.513 --> 40:11.580
Payback's a bitch.

40:11.614 --> 40:13.682
Okay, think about it.

40:13.716 --> 40:15.850
We still have the Buy More,
and-and we still have me.

40:15.885 --> 40:18.753
And, uh, Sarah
and Casey, you.

40:18.788 --> 40:20.355
This is still a team.
We can still do this.

40:20.389 --> 40:22.090
I think I, uh...
I think I need a little air.

40:25.127 --> 40:26.978
Chuck...

40:27.029 --> 40:29.147
Chuck...

40:29.198 --> 40:32.601
Listen, it's okay.
We'll bounce back. We always do.

40:32.635 --> 40:35.704
Yeah.

40:35.738 --> 40:38.406
I got to... uh...

40:38.441 --> 40:40.441
I'll be back.

40:48.918 --> 40:50.919
Chuck, you found it.

40:54.090 --> 40:56.124
What's the matter?

40:57.143 --> 40:59.010
I can't afford it.

40:59.061 --> 41:01.029
If I bought it yesterday
with our fortune,

41:01.063 --> 41:02.364
we'd own it,
but now...

41:04.433 --> 41:06.301
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.906
Well, so what?

41:11.941 --> 41:13.641
I mean, we knew
this wasn't

41:13.659 --> 41:15.310
gonna be easy,
and we didn't get married

41:15.344 --> 41:16.544
because we thought
life was easy.

41:16.579 --> 41:18.179
We got married

41:18.214 --> 41:20.649
so that we could be
there for each other

41:20.683 --> 41:22.350
when things got tough.

41:22.385 --> 41:26.154
So we could work through things
together, rich or poor.

41:26.188 --> 41:28.590
But how are we going to do this?
I mean, we got to start over.

41:28.624 --> 41:30.725
It's okay. We'll get new
clients and new missions.

41:30.760 --> 41:31.960
And we haven't
lost everything.

41:31.994 --> 41:33.678
We still have Castle
and the store.

41:33.713 --> 41:36.865
The Buy More.

41:36.899 --> 41:38.099
The Buy More.

41:38.134 --> 41:40.101
The Buy More.

41:40.136 --> 41:43.004
We use the store

41:43.039 --> 41:44.472
to support the spy team.

41:44.507 --> 41:45.807
We take Buy Mores' profits,

41:45.841 --> 41:47.609
put them
into Carmichael Industries

41:47.643 --> 41:49.444
until both companies
can make money.

41:49.478 --> 41:50.729
But in order for that to work,

41:50.780 --> 41:52.280
the store actually has
to turn a profit.

41:52.314 --> 41:53.748
We can do that.

41:53.783 --> 41:55.183
We can do that.

41:56.419 --> 41:59.120
What about me, though?

41:59.155 --> 42:00.989
You and Casey are super spies.

42:01.023 --> 42:02.323
Morgan's the Intersect.

42:02.358 --> 42:03.958
Who am I? What's my job?

42:03.993 --> 42:07.361
Chuck, you're our leader.

42:17.740 --> 42:19.591
That's the plan.

42:20.576 --> 42:22.477
As you can see,

42:22.511 --> 42:25.947
our superiors' interference
in Chuck Bartowski's life

42:25.981 --> 42:27.482
has only just begun.

42:29.351 --> 42:32.187
Now you understand
how important he is.

42:32.221 --> 42:34.756
And why he must fail.

42:34.790 --> 42:37.058
You all have your orders.

42:37.093 --> 42:39.160
This is the plan.

42:39.195 --> 42:41.830
Its final chapter.

42:43.492 --> 42:45.193
Nothing can stop it.
