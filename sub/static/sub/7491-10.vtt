WEBVTT

00:05.583 --> 00:08.291
Last day of school. Whoo!

00:09.125 --> 00:11.250
Until summer school. Woo.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.500
I've gotta find a way to get my
Venus Flytrap home for the summer.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.375
It's just a plant, dude. Take it home.

00:18.750 --> 00:22.208
I've been growing it hydroponically
with a synthetic photosynthesis light

00:22.291 --> 00:25.208
since the first day of school,
and it's pretty huge.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.875
It's not even eating flies anymore.
It's eating meatballs.

00:30.166 --> 00:32.417
Right. A plant that eats meatballs.

00:40.834 --> 00:42.083
Yep, that's definitely a meatball.

00:43.792 --> 00:45.709
Hey, did you guys get your end-of-the-year

00:45.792 --> 00:47.834
career evaluations
from the guidance counselor?

00:47.917 --> 00:49.834
Yes, I did, and they're a joke.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.834
Mine says I'm best suited to be a farmer.

00:52.208 --> 00:55.750
I'm allergic to cows,
terrified of hay, and seriously...

00:55.834 --> 00:58.041
Do these shoulders look like
they can hold up overalls?

00:59.417 --> 01:02.709
I didn't even pick mine up.
No one believes a word those things say.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.500
I just got my career evaluation.
I believe every word that this thing says.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.375
- Really?
Yup.

01:10.458 --> 01:11.750
You're looking at a new Eddie.

01:11.834 --> 01:13.834
I'm gonna be an archaeologist, baby.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.417
I'll be discovering lost cities,

01:16.500 --> 01:17.959
traveling the high seas,

01:18.041 --> 01:19.917
navigating the globe.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.083
And now...

01:21.875 --> 01:23.417
to Spanish class!

01:24.166 --> 01:26.542
Uh, Eddie, your Spanish class is that way.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.166
I knew that.

01:32.291 --> 01:35.458
<i>♪ Don't you get all tough with me ♪</i>

01:35.542 --> 01:39.417
<i>♪ I'm saying won't you

01:39.500 --> 01:42.250

01:49.166 --> 01:51.000
<i>♪ Here we go, let's start the party ♪</i>

01:51.083 --> 01:52.959

01:54.500 --> 01:57.542

01:57.625 --> 02:01.500

02:01.583 --> 02:04.250
<i>♪ And we could have a ball

<i>♪ That's just how we do ♪</i>

02:06.083 --> 02:08.041
<i>♪ And no matter how much

02:08.125 --> 02:10.750
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you ♪</i>

02:18.917 --> 02:22.458
Wow, Eddie, I'm really impressed.
I've never seen you so focused before.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.583
That's because I'm taking it seriously.

02:24.667 --> 02:28.375
One day, martial arts is gonna help me
avoid getting wedgied by a mummy.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.667
You know, I was wedgied by a mummy once.

02:32.125 --> 02:33.792
Halloween, 1995.

02:33.875 --> 02:34.959
Oh, no.

02:36.291 --> 02:38.333
It was so intense, I blacked out.

02:38.417 --> 02:40.542
When I woke up, all my candy was gone

02:40.625 --> 02:42.667
except for two Jolly Woppers
shoved up my nose.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.542
Rudy, I'm talking about actual mummies.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.959
We got our career evaluations back
from the guidance counselor,

02:50.041 --> 02:52.166
and it said I'm going
to be an archaeologist.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.750
Don't they just dust sand
off old bones in the desert?

02:55.166 --> 02:57.000
That's not what I'm going to be doing.

03:27.625 --> 03:30.333
What in the...

03:34.709 --> 03:36.500
Ew!

03:36.583 --> 03:38.125
Wow, a treasure hunter?

03:38.542 --> 03:39.875
What a cool career.

03:40.417 --> 03:42.667
But for the record,
mummies wear tighty-whities.

03:42.750 --> 03:43.792
Oh.

03:44.375 --> 03:45.250
Hey, you know what...

03:45.834 --> 03:48.792
I have the hat and bullwhip
from the Bobby Wasabi classic...

03:48.875 --> 03:51.250
"The Stink of the Sphinx".
You can totally have it.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.750
What? Thanks!

03:54.125 --> 03:57.000
Eddie, are you still talking
about your career evaluation?

03:57.375 --> 03:59.625
I told you, man, it doesn't
really mean anything.

03:59.709 --> 04:01.417
Seriously? Archaeologist?

04:02.125 --> 04:04.333
You come from four generations
of accountants.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.500
That is not true.
My grandfather was a urologist.

04:08.834 --> 04:11.750
Eddie, you're not exactly
the explorer type.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.542
Remember that Easter egg hunt?

04:13.625 --> 04:16.000
You didn't find any eggs
and you lost your basket.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.834
I didn't lose it.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.625
Someone stole it.

04:20.375 --> 04:22.083
And ate all my Peeps.

04:24.208 --> 04:26.709
Eddie, man, maybe you're just looking
at it all the wrong way.

04:26.792 --> 04:28.291
Accounting can be exciting.

04:28.375 --> 04:31.000
Oh, and don't even get me started
about the thrill ride of urology.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.792
Maybe you guys are right.

04:35.834 --> 04:37.417
I don't know what I was thinking.

04:38.583 --> 04:41.333
Thanks anyway, Rudy,
but I won't be needing that.

04:45.333 --> 04:46.458
What was that?

04:47.000 --> 04:47.917
What?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.917
I have never seen Eddie more alive

04:50.000 --> 04:52.208
than when he was talking
about being a treasure hunter.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.625
And what did you do?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.250
You told him he was
destined to be an accountant.

04:56.625 --> 04:57.917
But, Rudy, you don't understand.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.875
He thought those
career evaluations were real.

04:59.959 --> 05:02.458
It doesn't matter if they're real or not.
They're real to him.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.417
Friends build each other up.
They don't tear each other down.

05:06.166 --> 05:08.000
I thought I taught you better.

05:15.041 --> 05:17.291
There's that noise! I must find it!

05:27.333 --> 05:30.166
Oh, oh... thank you! See you next time.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.333
Rudy, you must help me.

05:33.417 --> 05:37.458
There's a noise in here that is driving
everyone crazy and ruining the business.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.208
That would be your voice.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.250
Oh, no. That's just a cricket.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.875
Oh!

05:45.375 --> 05:46.542
What is a "cricklet"?

05:47.291 --> 05:48.834
No, no, no. It's a "cricket".

05:48.917 --> 05:51.709
It's a small bug that makes noise
by rubbing its legs together.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.083
Oh, I had an uncle like that.

05:54.542 --> 05:57.834
One winter he wore corduroys
and set the whole village on fire.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.792
You know, I could help you, Phil.

06:01.166 --> 06:05.333
In certain circles, I'm known as
"the cricket whisperer".

06:13.750 --> 06:15.083
What did he say?

06:15.166 --> 06:17.917
He thinks your two-star rating
is very generous.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.250
Oh, look... there's a little nail hole.
Let me see if I can spot him.

06:23.875 --> 06:26.667
Ow! He just plucked my eyebrow.

06:32.166 --> 06:35.542
Okay, when Eddie gets in here,
we all have to act excited about the gift.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.417
That gift's lame, yo.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.375
I'll "whoo," but my heart won't be in it.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.500
You'll "whoo" like you always do.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.333
Do not tell a grown man how to "whoo".

06:44.458 --> 06:47.709
Look, guys, we owe it to Eddie to get him
excited about his future again.

06:49.750 --> 06:50.583
Hey, guys.

06:50.667 --> 06:52.250
- Eddie.
- Hey! Eddie!

06:53.291 --> 06:54.834
You know, we were thinking...

06:54.917 --> 06:57.625
Maybe you could be a great treasure
hunter and find all kinds of stuff.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.875
And you know why?

06:59.542 --> 07:01.417
- No, why?
- Pbbt...

07:03.291 --> 07:05.208
You found your way here, didn't you?

07:06.250 --> 07:08.417
And Jerry can't always do that.

07:09.458 --> 07:12.834
So, we all chipped in and bought you this.

07:12.917 --> 07:15.542
It's a hand-held geocaching unit.

07:15.709 --> 07:16.917
Geocaching?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.625
No, it's not geocaching.

07:19.709 --> 07:22.542
It's "geocaching"!
High-tech treasure hunting.

07:22.917 --> 07:24.083
Everyone's doing it.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.542
"This GPS device leads you on a journey

07:26.625 --> 07:29.000
using clues and coordinates
to find hidden treasure.

07:29.083 --> 07:31.542
Fun for ages 9 to 99".

07:31.625 --> 07:32.917
That's you!

07:34.417 --> 07:36.041
You guys really think I can do this?

07:36.125 --> 07:37.542
- Yeah, man.
- Absolutely.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.583
This might be the best gift I've ever got.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.333
Eddie, let your adventure begin.

07:42.875 --> 07:44.291
We're really excited for you.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.291
Aren't we, Jerry?

07:46.417 --> 07:48.500
Yeah. Sure are, man.

07:48.583 --> 07:49.834
Whoo.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.667
Whoo!

07:52.750 --> 07:53.959
- Cool, man.
- Yeah.

07:58.291 --> 08:01.041
This right here is gonna be
our lucky hole.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.875
Trust me, Phil...
if there's one thing I know...

08:02.959 --> 08:05.083
-
- ...it's how to fish for za cricket.

08:05.417 --> 08:09.458
You just take a little wadded-up bread,
some peanut butter, some 40-pound line...

08:09.542 --> 08:11.083
then you drop it in and wait.

08:11.333 --> 08:14.000
Oh, Rudy. You get him this time.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.709
You get that little "cricklet"!

08:16.667 --> 08:19.166
-
- And here we go.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.458
You know, I caught one in Phoenix once,

08:23.917 --> 08:25.959
it was this...

08:26.041 --> 08:27.000
...big.

08:32.083 --> 08:34.750
- Oh! I'm getting a little bite.
Hey, don't rush it, Rudy.

08:34.834 --> 08:37.709
- Let him take the bait.
Oh, here we go.

08:37.792 --> 08:39.291
Here we go! And...

08:39.875 --> 08:41.458
- I got him!
-

08:42.291 --> 08:43.542
Whoo! It's a big one.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.542
Stupid little "cricklet".

08:45.834 --> 08:47.583
Ow! Ow!

08:49.917 --> 08:51.000
Ow!

08:54.792 --> 08:56.542
Finally, school is out.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.375
First day of summer vacation.

08:58.458 --> 09:01.458
We should not waste a single second
doing anything we don't wanna do.

09:01.875 --> 09:02.875
Nope.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.709
I hope you guys know your
latitude from your longitude.

09:05.875 --> 09:09.125
Because Saturday we go
on a geocaching romp!

09:09.500 --> 09:10.709
I'm sorry, did you say "we"?

09:12.041 --> 09:14.458
Yes, I did. 6:00 A.M. sharp.

09:14.917 --> 09:17.083
We set out to find three secret locations,

09:17.166 --> 09:19.458
and in the last one,
we'll find our hidden treasure.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.417
No...

09:25.500 --> 09:27.250
It wouldn't be the same without you.

09:27.792 --> 09:28.917
Uh...

09:29.458 --> 09:30.792
Sorry, Eddie. I can't.

09:30.875 --> 09:33.041
See... see, the thing is, uh,
my aunt Carlita,

09:33.125 --> 09:35.792
who's a clown... in the circus.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.083
She... she... she fell off an elephant!

09:38.166 --> 09:40.917
Into... into one of those
tiger cage things, so...

09:41.000 --> 09:44.542
I've gotta take her to
her doctor's appointment.

09:46.542 --> 09:47.458
Yeah.

09:48.417 --> 09:53.000
Jerry, we're all gonna do this
for our friend who we support.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.208
- All right.
- Yeah.

09:55.291 --> 09:58.375
Oh! I got some really
cool gear for you guys to wear.

09:58.458 --> 10:01.625
It's in this duffel bag.
So, I will see you Saturday.

10:01.709 --> 10:04.792
Our first location is at the bottom
of Crescent Cove at the beach.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.917
Let the adventure begin!

10:07.000 --> 10:09.417
Yeah!
- So excited.

10:11.417 --> 10:12.834
- Summer!
- Seriously.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.500
Ooh! Sorry, aunt Carlita.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.125
No can do.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.375
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

10:27.667 --> 10:29.834
<i>Hold the rope tight, y'all.
I'm coming down.</i>

10:29.917 --> 10:32.166
Man, I still don't get
why he's wearing a dress.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.667
It's a caftan.
It's traditional desert wear.

10:35.917 --> 10:37.000
Oh!

10:37.083 --> 10:39.291
Would it kill him to wear
some traditional underpants?

10:43.291 --> 10:44.834
Kinda like wearing this thing.

10:44.917 --> 10:46.625
It lets the rest of Jerry breathe.

10:49.542 --> 10:53.500
Oh, ho! This must be the spot.
The GPS is flashing us a clue.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.125
<i>You're doing well.
You're on the case.</i>

10:57.208 --> 11:01.291
<i>What you seek's between
a rock and a hard place.</i>

11:01.375 --> 11:04.041
Whoo! This is ever so exciting.

11:04.125 --> 11:07.709
It reminds me of the long,
cold nights in the Congo...

11:08.000 --> 11:12.375
where the only things keeping you warm
were a sleeping bag and a hyena.

11:13.291 --> 11:16.500
If you don't stop doing that voice,
I'm gonna shove that monocle up your nose.

11:16.583 --> 11:19.208
I'm sorry. I'm just
trying to get into character for Eddie.

11:19.291 --> 11:21.208
- I suggest you do the same.
-

11:22.917 --> 11:25.959
Americans. So obnoxious.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.500
- Wait... Kim, why'd you stop?
-

11:29.583 --> 11:33.125
<i>Guys, I found a falcon's nest.
It's full of little baby falcons.</i>

11:33.333 --> 11:35.417
<i>Ooh, you are so cute!</i>

11:35.667 --> 11:37.834
<i>-
- Yes, you are.</i>

11:37.917 --> 11:42.834
Kim, darling, their mumsy's back
and she appears to be a tad peeved.

11:42.917 --> 11:45.333
<i>Aah! Get off me. Stop it!</i>
- Oh, dear.

11:46.625 --> 11:47.500
Whoa!

11:47.583 --> 11:48.834
- thuds )
-

11:56.542 --> 11:59.709
Those cute baby birds
messed you up, didn't they?

11:59.792 --> 12:02.250
Yes, they did. Yes, they did.

12:02.291 --> 12:03.417
Why don't you shut it?

12:04.917 --> 12:06.375
Guys, I think I got it.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.375
Cool. Our next coordinates.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.792
It looks like our next location
is over in Kramer Woods.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.041
Come on, let's go.

12:16.834 --> 12:20.875
Ew! What are those disgusting things?

12:20.959 --> 12:24.709
By jove, I do believe those
are giant springing jellyfish.

12:24.792 --> 12:27.250
Ooh, they must have
washed in with the tide.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.875
Why do they call 'em "springing"?

12:33.792 --> 12:35.250
Aah! Aah!

12:35.333 --> 12:36.375
I'm guessing that's why.

12:41.917 --> 12:44.709
So, what is this thing, Rudy?

12:44.792 --> 12:46.291
It's a bug zapper.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.375
As soon as I plug it in, the cricket
will be attracted to the light,

12:49.458 --> 12:51.041
and as soon as it touches
the metal grate...

12:51.125 --> 12:52.333
Bam! It gets zapped.

12:52.417 --> 12:55.000
Ha ha! Stupid "cricklets"!

13:00.500 --> 13:03.667
Oh! Well, I will say
this about the light...

13:04.750 --> 13:06.250
it is very nice.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.333
With its inviting purply glow...

13:10.583 --> 13:12.709
so peaceful...

13:16.125 --> 13:17.959
Why did you do that?

13:18.041 --> 13:21.583
I don't know, Rudy!
I think I might be part "cricklet".

13:24.834 --> 13:28.291
This is hopeless. All right? We're never
gonna catch that thing. I give up!

13:29.375 --> 13:31.625
Rudy! The counter!

13:31.709 --> 13:33.583
-
- I got him!

13:42.333 --> 13:44.542
Way to go, Jack Your first kiss
was with a sea creature.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.166
<i>Touché,</i> old girl!

13:48.625 --> 13:50.625
Quiet, guys. It's our next clue.

13:50.709 --> 13:54.583
<i>You're in the right area.
The moment's yours to seize.</i>

13:54.667 --> 13:58.333
<i>The tin with the coordinates
is hidden amongst the trees.</i>

14:00.083 --> 14:03.291
Well, how are we supposed to find that?
There's, like a million trees around here.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.083
We'll find it. We just need to split up.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.291
Kim, you come with me.
And you guys look around here.

14:08.750 --> 14:09.959
Are you kidding me?

14:10.542 --> 14:11.667
Hey, guys...

14:11.750 --> 14:13.083
look up there.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.041
- Where?
- Right up there.

14:15.125 --> 14:18.125
Look, there's something shiny in
that knothole, I bet it's the tin box.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.834
Good show, old chap.

14:20.917 --> 14:23.625
But how in the figgy pudding
are we gonna get up there?

14:26.208 --> 14:29.125
You know, early man
believed trees could speak.

14:29.709 --> 14:31.041
You just have to know how to listen.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.709
Go ahead, tree. I'm listening.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.542
- Eddie...
- Ooh, we got a talker.

14:40.709 --> 14:43.375
Do you have any idea where the tin box is?

14:44.208 --> 14:45.709
Stop acting like an idiot.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.750
Well, this conversation is over!

14:51.750 --> 14:53.375
All right. So, we'll hold the branch down,

14:53.458 --> 14:55.834
while you crawl up it
to see if the box is there.

14:55.917 --> 14:58.208
Brilliant. But do hold it steady.

14:58.625 --> 15:00.917
There's a good bit of tension
on this branch.

15:01.792 --> 15:03.208
We got it, Milton.

15:03.458 --> 15:05.792
-
- Whoa! Okay, that's not good.

15:06.083 --> 15:07.166
What's your problem?

15:07.250 --> 15:10.375
Uh, I think a chipmunk
just ran up my dress.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.542
-
- Jerry!

15:12.625 --> 15:15.125
It's foraging, and not in a good way.

15:15.208 --> 15:16.750
- Jerry!
- Oh!

15:16.834 --> 15:18.250
Jerry, I'm losing my grip.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.291
Blimey!

15:20.375 --> 15:23.583
Whoo! Jack! Help me get this
chipmunk out of my dress, man.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.583
Ow! Ow! Ah!

15:25.875 --> 15:26.875
I'm... I'm good, thanks.

15:33.208 --> 15:36.458
Eddie, would you help me? The tin box
isn't just gonna fall out of the sky.

15:40.667 --> 15:41.667
-
- I've got it.

15:41.750 --> 15:44.291
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

15:45.208 --> 15:46.500
-
- Yes,

15:46.583 --> 15:50.083
we have journeyed long and hard
to return you to the wild.

15:51.125 --> 15:52.250
For this is your world,

15:52.750 --> 15:54.333
a world we know not.

15:56.125 --> 15:57.959
And although you almost destroyed us...

15:58.875 --> 16:00.667
and Phil's Restaurant....

16:00.750 --> 16:03.208
you've proven to be a worthy adversary.

16:03.291 --> 16:05.125
-
- And we respect you.

16:06.291 --> 16:07.917
- So, go now!
-

16:08.000 --> 16:09.542
Return to your kind,

16:09.625 --> 16:11.625
and be... would you please stop that?

16:11.709 --> 16:13.250
Sorry! Sorry.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.250
May your legs always rub
a song of freedom.

16:22.625 --> 16:23.667
Rudy, it's on your nose.

16:24.667 --> 16:25.625
I'll get it.

16:28.625 --> 16:31.000
It's still there, Rudy.
Let me get my cello.

16:42.583 --> 16:45.375
Um... Eddie, are you sure
we're in the right place?

16:45.417 --> 16:46.834
We're in a dockyard.

16:46.917 --> 16:49.500
Yeah, it really doesn't look like
the place for anything--

16:49.583 --> 16:51.375
-
- Eddie's got this. Pssh!

16:51.458 --> 16:52.667
Doubting him.

16:53.625 --> 16:56.875
<i>You've found the dock,
succeeding beyond all measure.</i>

16:56.959 --> 17:00.959
<i>Near one of these crates
lies your hidden treasure.</i>

17:01.041 --> 17:03.166
All right. Where do we start?

17:03.250 --> 17:05.208
Okay, here's what we're
gonna do... Kim, Milton--

17:05.291 --> 17:06.542
Check it out, guys.

17:07.125 --> 17:12.250
Another bunch of losers down here on
our docks looking for their little box.

17:13.709 --> 17:14.875
You're not getting it.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.333
Mister...

17:20.041 --> 17:22.291
My friends and I have been
through a lot to get that.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.250
And I know it seems like
a silly game to you, but...

17:25.834 --> 17:27.250
we're not leaving without it.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.083
Really?

17:29.500 --> 17:32.542
And what are you gonna do to get it?

17:38.875 --> 17:40.959
Okay, it may be time to dance.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.417
Uh, Jack, I don't think
that's a good idea.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.125
I think we should fight these guys.
I'll dance with you later, though.

18:14.125 --> 18:16.041
Want to learn a Fisherman's knot?

18:16.125 --> 18:21.250
First you take it right here,
then you slip it through here.

18:21.291 --> 18:23.375
Then it's time to hoist the jib.

18:43.667 --> 18:47.291
You guys want this box so bad,
you should go fish it out of the ocean.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.792
Eddie!

19:01.375 --> 19:03.792
Poor bloke. Never even had a chance.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.458
He didn't even have his floaties.

19:08.959 --> 19:10.417
- Oh! Oh, come on.
- Eddie!

19:10.500 --> 19:11.917
- Oh!
- Eddie!

19:12.000 --> 19:13.500
We thought you fell into the ocean.

19:13.583 --> 19:14.667
I wish.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.625
I fell into a barge filled with fish guts.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.792
Lucky!

19:21.208 --> 19:23.458
I can't believe we came this
close to getting our treasure.

19:24.208 --> 19:26.959
And all I got was a close encounter
with Jerry's chipmunk.

19:29.208 --> 19:30.250
Yeah...

19:30.333 --> 19:33.750
It'd be a real shame to have gone through
all of that without ending up with...

19:34.917 --> 19:35.875
this!

19:39.875 --> 19:41.291
-
- Not gonna work.

19:42.667 --> 19:43.625
Totally...

19:43.709 --> 19:45.667
- Open it! Open it!
- Okay.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.792
- Oh!
- Whoa!

19:48.875 --> 19:50.583
- That's awesome!
- Isn't it amazing?

19:50.667 --> 19:51.750
- Love it!
- Yes!

19:55.041 --> 19:56.875
Hey, guys. How was geocaching?

19:56.959 --> 19:58.834
Well, I got covered in fish guts.

19:58.917 --> 20:00.125
I was attacked by a falcon.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.000
I had a chipmunk run up my dress.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.542
I was a human cannonball.

20:03.625 --> 20:05.834
And I got to first base with a jellyfish.

20:07.166 --> 20:10.375
- That sounds horrible.
- No way. Best summer vacation ever.

20:12.125 --> 20:13.917
And, check out our treasure.

20:18.417 --> 20:19.291
That's it?

20:19.417 --> 20:21.542
It's a... crummy rubber rabbit.

20:23.125 --> 20:25.041
Oh, there's money inside it, right?

20:26.250 --> 20:27.500
No.

20:28.041 --> 20:29.458
The rabbit is the treasure.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.875
A reminder of the adventure I went on...

20:32.417 --> 20:33.709
with my friends.

20:34.917 --> 20:36.250
But there's money in it, right?

20:37.583 --> 20:38.792
You know what, Eddie?

20:39.291 --> 20:42.583
After today, we'll follow you
on any adventure you wanna go on.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.333
Right, guys?

20:44.417 --> 20:45.917
- Absolutely.
- Definitely. Of course.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.125
Yeah. Thanks.

20:52.291 --> 20:53.458
-
- All right.

20:53.542 --> 20:56.208
- Let's go.
- Now, come on, guys. Falafel's on me.

20:56.291 --> 20:58.875
- Ooh, I'm loving that.
- Ooh, I like falafel. Let's do that.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.458
So, this little rubber rabbit
was the treasure?

21:10.542 --> 21:12.458
Yeah. And here's my theory...

21:12.542 --> 21:16.417
Inside the rabbit is a microchip
with a bank account number.

21:16.834 --> 21:18.166
- So, genius...
- Mm-hm.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.333
And you take that number,
you punch it into a computer,

21:20.417 --> 21:22.208
and it's up-linked to a satellite.

21:27.709 --> 21:31.333
Now, that satellite transmits it
to a database in China, where it...
