-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.833 --> 00:40.667
in a court of law.

00:42.033 --> 00:44.100
-Right here in the gulf,
there's a large mixture

00:44.133 --> 00:46.567
of cultures and diversities,
and you get everything

00:46.600 --> 00:49.867
from career criminals to people
who just drink too much
and want to fight you.

00:49.900 --> 00:52.567
Any given day,
it's really something different.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.233
Can't really nail it down
to a certain demographic.

00:55.267 --> 00:57.167
We're heading to
a suspicious person call.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.933
Report is saying there's--

00:58.967 --> 01:01.167
-(police radio chatter)
-Three individuals standing

01:01.200 --> 01:02.900
out by a house,
sitting by the curb,

01:02.933 --> 01:05.733
and he knows for a fact
that they don't live there.

01:05.767 --> 01:08.533
Let's go make
some casual conversation.

01:08.567 --> 01:10.167
-(car door opens)

01:13.067 --> 01:15.167
-Yo, y'all live here?

01:15.200 --> 01:16.233
-Just here.
-Huh?

01:16.267 --> 01:17.567
-I'm posted.
-You just posted?

01:17.600 --> 01:19.333
-Yeah.
-You all right?

01:19.367 --> 01:21.333
-I'm good.
You see me. I ain't--

01:21.367 --> 01:22.533
-Okay. You sure?

01:22.567 --> 01:25.067
You got weapons on you
or anything like that? Huh?

01:25.100 --> 01:26.600
-No, I don't.

01:26.633 --> 01:28.100
-What you all doing
over here, man?

01:28.133 --> 01:30.200
-It's just to hang.
We just chillin', man.
-Huh?

01:30.233 --> 01:31.867
-We just be chilling. Why you--
-Who's this?

01:31.900 --> 01:33.200
Hey, don't act like that.

01:33.233 --> 01:35.233
-I'm just saying why
you hitting me up right now?

01:35.267 --> 01:37.200
-I'm just asking you
what's going on. Who's this?

01:37.233 --> 01:38.333
-Ain't nothing
going on, man.

01:38.367 --> 01:40.733
I'm just here.
It's-- At my boy house.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.600
-Mmkay. Come over here, dude.

01:42.633 --> 01:43.800
You all right?

01:43.833 --> 01:46.567
-(mumbles)
-Come over here, man.
Hey, come here.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.267
-I ain't gotta do it.
I'm not reppin' none of that.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.933
-Hey, put your hands
on there real quick, dude.

01:49.967 --> 01:52.500
-Why? What are you doing?
-Just put your hands on there
real quick, dude.

01:52.533 --> 01:54.067
-What you doing?
-Hey, come here, man.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.467
-What is you doing right now?
-Huh?

01:55.500 --> 01:58.067
-Why are you arresting me?
-You're being detained.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.100
-For what?
-Huh?

01:59.133 --> 02:00.733
-Why am I being detained?

02:00.767 --> 02:02.800
-Come here.
Why are you trying
to back out, man?

02:02.833 --> 02:04.067
Were y'all smoking?

02:04.067 --> 02:05.067
Do you got
anything on you?

02:05.100 --> 02:06.900
Keep your hands up.
-Got nothing on me, sir.

02:06.933 --> 02:09.967
-Huh?
-I don't have nothing
on me, sir, so you can--

02:10.067 --> 02:11.733
-Nah.
-You can see.
Look in my pockets.

02:11.767 --> 02:14.100
-Okay. Lean over.
-Uh, sure.

02:14.133 --> 02:16.367
-(police radio beeps)
-North 360. A unit please.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.800
-Sir--
-Stop.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.667
-That's my-- my shoulder.
-Stop.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.700
Don't do that.

02:21.733 --> 02:22.733
Hey, don't do that.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.400
-I'm not.
-Hey, don't. Stop resisting.

02:25.433 --> 02:26.567
Stop resisting, okay?

02:26.600 --> 02:28.067
-I'm chill.
-Then chill out.

02:28.067 --> 02:30.533
-Man, this is police brutality.
-This ain't police brutality.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.833
-What's going on, sir?
-Stop.

02:31.867 --> 02:34.900
-It's not necessary.
-Don't. Don't move.

02:34.933 --> 02:36.500
-(mumbles)

02:36.533 --> 02:38.433
-Put your other hand
behind your back.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.533
-(police radio beeps)
-North 360. A unit.

02:40.567 --> 02:41.633
-(mumbles, chuckles)

02:41.667 --> 02:42.867
Hold up. I'm--

02:42.900 --> 02:44.633
-Is that your car right there?
Don't move.

02:44.667 --> 02:46.800
-What am I doing that's--
-Don't move.

02:55.267 --> 02:57.800
-(police radio beeps)
-North 36. Fightin'.

03:00.633 --> 03:01.933
Stop.

03:01.967 --> 03:03.067
Stop.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.067
Stop. Stop!

03:06.067 --> 03:07.433
Stop resisting.

03:07.467 --> 03:09.067
Stop resisting!

03:11.100 --> 03:12.567
Stop resiting!

03:12.600 --> 03:14.700
Stop resisting!

03:14.733 --> 03:16.167
What are you doing? Huh?

03:16.200 --> 03:17.467
-(police radio beeps)
-Still fightin'.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.267
-(police radio chatter)

03:20.500 --> 03:22.400
-(grunts)
-Stop.

03:22.433 --> 03:23.767
Stop.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.333
Stop resisting!

03:25.367 --> 03:26.367
Turn onto your stomach.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.200
-(groans)
-Turn onto your stomach!

03:28.233 --> 03:30.467
-On my stomach?
-You see this?

03:30.500 --> 03:31.567
Y'all see this?

03:31.600 --> 03:32.967
Police brutality, man.

03:33.067 --> 03:34.867
-You move, you get tased.
You understand me?

03:34.900 --> 03:36.567
You understand me?

03:36.600 --> 03:38.433
-(police siren blares)

03:46.833 --> 03:49.067
-Police brutality, man!
-Stand right there.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.500
-I'm standing.
I been standing here, bro.

03:50.533 --> 03:52.600
My mama's a sergeant, bro.
I got you recorded.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.133
-Get up.
-You're going-- I'm telling you
you getting reported, sir.

03:55.167 --> 03:57.867
This is unnecessary.
I'm getting arrested
for no reason.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.133
-(police siren blares)

04:07.067 --> 04:08.100
-Take him.

04:08.133 --> 04:09.867
Take him to the car.
I got two more.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.300
He's got a bunch of dope
in both those cars right there.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.333
-(police radio chatter)

04:14.367 --> 04:16.667
-Why you fightin'?
-I wasn't fighting, sir.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.133
-Why were you resisting, man?

04:18.167 --> 04:20.467
-I wasn't resisting, sir.
-Come on now.

04:23.633 --> 04:24.733
Don't. Don't move.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.167
-I'm not gonna move, sir.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.433
-(police radio chatter)

04:30.467 --> 04:31.800
-Lean up.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.500
That's what you're trying
to hide, ain't it?

04:34.533 --> 04:36.267
-No, sir.
-Lean forward.

04:39.933 --> 04:41.633
-Officer:
Was this suspicious vehicle?

04:41.667 --> 04:43.067
-Suspicious person.
-Uh-huh.

04:43.067 --> 04:45.067
-This is the marijuana
I took off the male

04:45.067 --> 04:46.200
that I was wrestling with.

04:46.233 --> 04:47.433
-A whole thing of that?
-Yeah.

04:47.467 --> 04:49.333
He's probably got
more in the car, so.

04:49.367 --> 04:52.333
-We're gonna search.
-Gonna look at
this car real quick.

04:52.367 --> 04:55.300
We got more marijuana
in plain view.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.833
It's probably what
he was trying to hide

04:56.867 --> 04:58.533
when everybody was
getting out as well.

04:58.567 --> 05:00.467
We got ammo right there.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.267
.40 cal Smith & Wesson.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.400
Most likely got the gun
in here somewhere.

05:09.467 --> 05:11.867
Uh, multiple small baggies
of marijuana

05:11.900 --> 05:13.467
located in the backseat.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.200
And we got some more pills
right there. That looks
to be like ecstasy.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.267
We'll test it.
He'll also get
a charge with that

05:18.300 --> 05:19.500
of intent to sell.

05:19.533 --> 05:21.500
-Officer: Got a few more.
-You got some in there?

05:21.533 --> 05:22.667
-Yeah.
-All right.

05:22.700 --> 05:25.333
Probably looking
at a couple ounces.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.267
Hey, can you find
the owner of this car?

05:27.300 --> 05:29.233
-It's the guy
that's in my backseat.
-Okay.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.933
Which car is yours
up there, man?

05:31.967 --> 05:33.267
-That black Altima.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.067
-The black Altima?
The front left?

05:35.067 --> 05:37.067
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. That's your car?

05:37.067 --> 05:39.367
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.067
What y'all doing
over here, man?

05:41.067 --> 05:43.433
-Sir, I was just gonna
go to a party

05:43.467 --> 05:45.067
and I picked up
a few friends.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.833
-Uh-huh.
-And they were
in my backseat.

05:46.867 --> 05:48.267
-Everything we're finding
in that car,

05:48.300 --> 05:49.667
who does that belong to?

05:49.700 --> 05:52.433
-Um... to people
that were in the backseat.

05:52.467 --> 05:54.133
-Mmkay. Well, it's
your car, right?

05:54.167 --> 05:57.633
-Uh... yes, sir.
But it's not mine.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.433
-Not yours?
-No, sir.

05:59.467 --> 06:01.567
-All right.
Hang tight.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.233
We're gonna tow
that vehicle out of here.

06:03.267 --> 06:04.433
He's got all
that dope in there.

06:04.467 --> 06:06.300
This is the male
I first detained.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.800
-I ain't do nothing.
-I'm saying, well, it's not time
to plead a case right now.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.400
Put him in the car.

06:10.433 --> 06:12.533
-I'm saying it.
-He was kind of trying
to get behind me a little bit.

06:12.567 --> 06:13.800
I'm like,
"No, we ain't playing that."

06:13.833 --> 06:15.633
-Right.
-You got the other guy?

06:15.667 --> 06:16.667
-Yeah.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.067
-So why were
you resisting, man?

06:18.067 --> 06:19.367
-No, I was just falling over.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.667
-You was just falling over?

06:20.700 --> 06:21.767
-Yeah.
-You sure?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.200
-And when you pulled
me out and (bleep),

06:23.233 --> 06:24.733
I started-- You know
what I'm saying? You--

06:24.767 --> 06:26.500
-Are you on
any drugs, man?

06:26.533 --> 06:27.767
You high?

06:27.800 --> 06:29.533
Is that your marijuana?

06:29.567 --> 06:31.733
-Nah, no, that's my--
that's my boy car.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.667
-Your boy car?
I saw you driving it.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.067
-I didn't know
that was y'all.

06:35.067 --> 06:36.400
I thought somebody was
trying to get us.

06:36.433 --> 06:37.867
-Oh, yeah?
-That's why I started--

06:37.900 --> 06:40.233
-So we gonna take
them drugs off you,
put the charge on him?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.367
-Huh?
-All right.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.267
Watch your elbow.
Lean that way.

06:45.067 --> 06:46.633
-(sighs)

06:46.667 --> 06:49.067
-This is the marijuana
we found inside this vehicle.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.633
So both males I've detained,

06:53.667 --> 06:55.233
one will be getting
the dope charges

06:55.267 --> 06:56.800
and a resisting arrest.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.533
We also got
the owner of the vehicle.

06:58.567 --> 07:00.067
We're gonna take him
to Clay Road,

07:00.100 --> 07:04.600
see if the district attorney
wants to accept charges on it.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.067
-When my dad found out
I was gonna be a police officer,

07:07.067 --> 07:08.667
he was in the Middle East
fightin' a war.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.133
He called me up and he said,

07:10.167 --> 07:11.767
"Son, you know, the job
is too dangerous."

07:11.800 --> 07:13.200
And I quickly
reminded him that,

07:13.233 --> 07:15.133
"You know, Dad,
you're in the Middle East
fightin' a war.

07:15.167 --> 07:16.767
I mean, that in itself
is dangerous."

07:16.800 --> 07:20.867
And then after that,
he just accepted it
and let it be.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.067
We're going to a call.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.300
A disturbance, uh,
between a few males.

07:25.333 --> 07:26.633
It's our third call tonight.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.367
The caller is known to me.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.133
I've dealt with him
a few times before

07:30.167 --> 07:32.067
and it becoming a third time,
it's becoming a nuisance,

07:32.100 --> 07:34.333
and we may have to
do something tonight.

07:34.367 --> 07:37.300
-(police radio chatter)

07:39.533 --> 07:41.833
-Let me see your hands,
let me see your hands.

07:41.867 --> 07:44.233
-(yelling)
-Put-- put down.
Put down. Put it down.

07:44.267 --> 07:46.333
Put it down.
Put down the other hand too.

07:46.367 --> 07:47.700
Put it down.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.500
Lay down on the ground.

07:49.533 --> 07:51.700
Away from the knife.
Get away from the knife.

07:51.733 --> 07:53.400
Get away from the knife!

07:53.433 --> 07:55.200
-Okay. I'm the one that--
-I understand.

07:55.233 --> 07:56.667
Put your arms out
to your side.

07:56.700 --> 07:59.333
-(police radio beeps)
-Dispatch, subject
came at me with a knife.

07:59.367 --> 08:01.067
He's down.

08:01.100 --> 08:02.233
Stay where you are.

08:02.267 --> 08:03.633
Put your face down.
Look away from me.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.300
Look away,
look away, look away.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.467
Look the other way.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.167
The other way, Oliver.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.067
Put your hands
behind your back.

08:10.067 --> 08:12.400
-(knife scrapes on ground)
-Look away for me, Oliver.

08:12.433 --> 08:14.400
Put your-- put
your face down, Oliver.

08:14.433 --> 08:15.967
-It's my property.

08:16.067 --> 08:19.333
-Relax, relax, relax.
Relax your hands.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.233
Relax, Oliver.
Oliver, relax.

08:21.267 --> 08:22.800
-I'm trying.
I've got bad elbows.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.667
Why am I getting arrested?

08:24.700 --> 08:27.233
-Well, you were come running up
to me with a knife.
-I wasn't coming. I was--

08:27.267 --> 08:29.267
-(police radio beeps)
-10-4. I've got him
detained right now.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.867
-Man on radio:
Your transmission was garbled.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.633
He approached you with a knife,
but everything is 10-24
at this time?

08:33.667 --> 08:35.700
-That's 2-- That's 10-4.
-(speaking indistinctly)

08:35.733 --> 08:38.533
-We're 10-74 right now.
He's in handcuffs.

08:38.567 --> 08:40.233
-Is he?
-Put your-- put your--

08:40.267 --> 08:41.767
Here, bring your legs
together, Oliver.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.667
Bring your legs to you.
Bring your legs...

08:43.700 --> 08:45.133
bring your legs
to your chest.

08:45.167 --> 08:46.433
Bring your legs
to your chest, okay?

08:46.467 --> 08:48.533
-I wasn't trying
to come at you, man.
I was petrified.

08:48.567 --> 08:50.367
-I know. Help me
get you up. Up.
-All right.

08:52.433 --> 08:54.333
-Let's go sit
on the back of the truck
over here, okay?

08:54.367 --> 08:55.833
-Well, the pictures
I took of him...

08:55.867 --> 08:57.900
-Okay. I'll look, I'll look.
Have a seat for me.

08:57.933 --> 08:59.067
What's happening tonight?

08:59.067 --> 09:00.800
-I had my English friends
come over.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.633
-Uh-huh.
-And then I guess
a couple of their girlfriends

09:03.667 --> 09:05.167
invited some
of their girlfriends.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.300
Word spread there was
a house to stay at.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.267
-Okay.
-I've been coming
home every day,

09:09.300 --> 09:11.733
"You need to go,
you need to go,
you need to go."

09:11.767 --> 09:13.533
And I've called twice,
and every time

09:13.567 --> 09:15.100
the officers come,
there's no one there.

09:15.133 --> 09:17.067
Okay. Oliver,
may I ask this question?

09:17.100 --> 09:19.067
How much have you had
to drink tonight?

09:19.067 --> 09:20.567
-Maybe seven.
-Seven?

09:20.600 --> 09:22.300
Eight? The normal stuff?

09:22.333 --> 09:24.833
-Yeah, but that,
that's worn off...

09:24.867 --> 09:26.467
-Okay. Did you take
any drugs today at all?
-No.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.967
-No?
-I've stopped doing my pills.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.867
-Oliver, come on.
Do you recognize my face?

09:29.900 --> 09:32.133
-Yeah, of course I do.
-I've dealt with you
many, many times.

09:32.167 --> 09:33.667
-Yes, yes.
-Okay. You're drunk again.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.933
-No, I'm not.
-There's nobody here.
They've been out here--

09:35.967 --> 09:37.433
That's the third time.
-Oh, my god.

09:37.467 --> 09:38.933
Can we look
at the video cameras?
-Whoa, whoa.

09:38.967 --> 09:41.367
Now how did you wind up
out of your house
with a knife?

09:41.400 --> 09:42.633
-'Cause one girl was, like,

09:42.667 --> 09:44.867
pointing that way--
No, that way.

09:44.900 --> 09:48.067
He was behind the fridge,
so if I'd run into the kitchen--

09:48.067 --> 09:49.733
-Now when you say--
You told him to leave though?

09:49.767 --> 09:52.400
-Yeah, both of them,
and they just started,
"I'll (bleep) you, man.

09:52.433 --> 09:54.333
We'll cut you up.
We'll shoot a (bleep)
bullet in you."

09:54.367 --> 09:56.200
-Okay, you said
they were gonna
slash your tires, right?

09:56.233 --> 09:58.067
-Well, he was doing that
while I was on the phone to--

09:58.067 --> 10:00.233
-Where's your car?
-It's a golf cart.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.167
-The golf cart?
So he was slashing
your golf cart tires?

10:02.200 --> 10:04.833
-And then I said,
"He's trying to slash
my golf cart tires right now,"

10:04.867 --> 10:07.133
and he spat
and then he started running.

10:07.167 --> 10:08.633
-Okay.
-Yeah.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.400
I mean, can you get
these off of me, man? Please?

10:10.433 --> 10:13.500
-Okay, well hold on
for a few minutes.

10:13.533 --> 10:15.500
So he's claiming again
there's people in the house,

10:15.533 --> 10:17.267
and we pulled up,
I got out of the truck

10:17.300 --> 10:19.133
and looked over my shoulder,
and here he is running.

10:19.167 --> 10:21.100
-I was running away!
-Stay quiet for me,
Oliver, okay?

10:21.133 --> 10:22.567
He was running toward me

10:22.600 --> 10:24.433
and he's got
the knife up like this

10:24.467 --> 10:25.833
and his other hand
up like this

10:25.867 --> 10:27.733
and I worded him
to the ground.

10:27.767 --> 10:30.200
He says he's got pictures
and videos of the people today.

10:30.233 --> 10:32.133
-Oliver: Yeah, there's
one black person. You see?
-Where?

10:32.167 --> 10:34.967
-Right there on
the white-yellow couch.
-There was nobody there.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.667
-There was.
-There's not.
I'm telling you.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.467
Here's the deal.
Here's what we're gonna do.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.067
Okay, you're out drunk--

10:41.100 --> 10:43.533
-No, I'm not out drunk.
-You're running around
with a knife--

10:43.567 --> 10:44.733
-Oh, my life.
-Okay?

10:44.767 --> 10:46.600
You could have ran out
in the traffic and got hurt.

10:46.633 --> 10:48.600
All right?
So, we're gonna take you
into protective custody.

10:48.633 --> 10:49.733
We're gonna take
you over to--

10:49.767 --> 10:51.367
-Are you kidding me?
-No, I'm dead serious.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.800
-My mum gets in town
tomorrow, you know.
-Okay. Coming with me, okay?

10:53.833 --> 10:56.367
What are you gonna do to
my condo with a bunch of
freaking people in there?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.633
-The same thing I did last time.
I'm gonna kick 'em all out...

10:58.667 --> 11:00.433
-And then I'll get
back in, yeah?
-Okay. Yep.

11:00.467 --> 11:01.733
Are you familiar
with Oliver?

11:01.767 --> 11:03.533
-Officer: No, I'm not.
-Yeah, he's from England

11:03.567 --> 11:04.733
and his parents sent
him over here

11:04.767 --> 11:06.233
'cause they don't want
to deal with him.

11:06.267 --> 11:08.300
-Usually nobody's in there?
-Yeah.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.233
-(police radio chatter)

11:10.267 --> 11:11.833
-Clear in the kitchen.

11:14.533 --> 11:16.967
-All right, we're good.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.933
Oliver drinks a lot
and drives his golf cart around.

11:20.967 --> 11:24.200
I'm checking it out to see
if there's any tire slash marks.

11:24.233 --> 11:26.167
But again, there's nothing.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.433
Oliver.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.367
Who you talking to, Oliver?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.933
-Whoever I can talk to.
I'm not drunk, man.

11:33.967 --> 11:35.867
-Okay.
-I've been sober
since that stuff started.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.933
-Yeah? Well, Oliver,
you know, it's--

11:37.967 --> 11:40.633
-Man, I'm gonna go to sleep.
I have to get my mum.
-I understand that,

11:40.667 --> 11:43.467
but you do realize is
you were in the direction
of a police officer

11:43.500 --> 11:45.767
with a knife.
-I was trying to get
your attention. I was scared.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.933
Wouldn't you be scared
of a Black guy running
after you?

11:47.967 --> 11:50.500
-I'm a little scared
of you running after me
with a knife like this.

11:50.533 --> 11:53.567
-Well, I wasn't meaning that.
At the time all I was thinking
was finding the police.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.233
-Well, do you think
that was a good decision,

11:55.267 --> 11:57.067
to run towards me
with a knife?
-I wasn't thinking.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.067
-I know. Also we went
inside your house.
We looked around.

11:59.067 --> 12:01.533
There's nobody in there.
Nobody by the refrigerator.

12:01.567 --> 12:04.367
-(indistinct)
-Okay? Nobody tried
to slash your tires.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.667
There's no one there.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.267
-There was.
-Okay, you're seeing
things, Oliver.

12:07.300 --> 12:09.767
And the picture that
I was able to see,
that you showed me,

12:09.800 --> 12:12.100
that you showed me of somebody
sitting in a chair in a photo,

12:12.133 --> 12:13.833
there was nobody there.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.333
It's the third time
we've been out here now.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.233
-I'm not drunk, man.
I haven't done pills.

12:17.267 --> 12:20.067
I'm tired.
I haven't slept
and you're trying to get--

12:20.067 --> 12:21.500
-You are messed up
and you reek of alcohol.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.700
-Ugh. I'm sweatin' it out.

12:23.733 --> 12:26.100
-And you got beers
all over your house.
Half of 'em full--

12:26.133 --> 12:28.100
-Yeah, half of 'em
are from the other
(bleep) people.

12:28.133 --> 12:29.467
Come on, man.
-All right--

12:29.500 --> 12:31.567
-It's not gonna do any
difference to me going to detox.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.367
-I know it's not,
and that's the thing, Oliver--

12:33.400 --> 12:35.833
-So can you just take me home,
please, please?
-I can't, Oliver.

12:35.867 --> 12:37.767
Every time that
you go to rehab,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.067
you get out
and don't care.

12:39.067 --> 12:40.967
Okay? You may not
care about yourself,

12:41.067 --> 12:42.800
but right now, today,
I care about you.

12:42.833 --> 12:45.700
You almost got shot,
you're running down
a direction with a knife.

12:45.733 --> 12:47.367
-I wish I did now.
-Okay?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.200
No, don't say that, Oliver.
-Why not? (bleep)

12:49.233 --> 12:50.467
This is like getting shot.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.467
Your mum comes here
to see you all happy,

12:52.500 --> 12:53.733
and now what? This?

12:53.767 --> 12:55.567
Are you kidding me, mate?

12:55.600 --> 12:58.167
-And you'll be calling us back
all night long.
-I wasn't delusional this time.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.600
I-- I have my girlfriend--

12:59.633 --> 13:01.233
-So the other two times,
you were delusional?

13:01.267 --> 13:03.633
-I was rushing around,
but I knew there was
people there.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.833
I knew there was.
This time they were
in my face.

13:05.867 --> 13:08.067
-There was someone
in your face? Okay.
-Threatening to stab me.

13:08.067 --> 13:10.267
Come on, man. Please.

13:10.300 --> 13:13.600
That's just really ridiculous.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.133
These handcuffs are killing me.

13:16.167 --> 13:18.167
-We're just gonna take him
into protective custody tonight.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.533
He's not under arrest
or anything.

13:19.567 --> 13:21.667
I'm not gonna charge him
for moving toward me
for a knife.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.067
You know, I believe
he believes he's seeing things,

13:24.067 --> 13:26.467
so we'll just get him
some substance abuse help

13:26.500 --> 13:28.233
and hopefully this time
he'll learn from it,

13:28.267 --> 13:32.367
but probably won't.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.733
-Rashell and I are
identical twins,

13:33.767 --> 13:35.600
and we were just so close.

13:35.633 --> 13:38.400
She obviously told everybody
that she's eight minutes older

13:38.433 --> 13:40.367
and my boss,
but that's okay.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.967
My sister is awesome.

13:42.067 --> 13:43.867
We've had two
separate careers together.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.400
I live across the street
from her.

13:45.433 --> 13:46.900
She's my everything, you know?

13:46.933 --> 13:48.733
We've done everything together
our whole lives.

13:48.767 --> 13:49.833
She rocks.

13:49.867 --> 13:53.067
-My biggest fear
in life would be

13:53.067 --> 13:56.200
to be on this earth
without Laura.

13:56.233 --> 13:57.867
It would be devastating.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.200
-(police siren blares)

13:59.233 --> 14:01.100
-We're gonna try to stop
this vehicle right here.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.367
It's unregistered
and it made a turn

14:03.400 --> 14:04.800
without a signal as well.

14:04.833 --> 14:07.067
-(police radio beeps)
-Control center 2467.

14:07.067 --> 14:09.600
-Number two, go ahead.
-Unregistered.

14:09.633 --> 14:11.400
-It's gonna be
a gold Lincoln town car.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.867
We're gonna be Industrial
and D.I.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.700
-(beep)
-(siren blares)

14:17.400 --> 14:18.400
-(beep)
-(siren stops)

14:23.867 --> 14:27.167
-Hey, Sis, make sure they roll
all their windows down for me.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.433
-Hello, sir. Hi.

14:29.467 --> 14:31.300
Is it-- Can you roll
the windows down or--

14:31.333 --> 14:32.933
-I actually can't.
These are broken.
-Okay.

14:32.967 --> 14:34.700
Is there anyone else
inside the vehicle besides you?

14:34.733 --> 14:35.967
-No. Nobody.
-Okay. Can you go ahead

14:36.067 --> 14:38.167
and step out of the vehicle
for me then?
-Sure.

14:40.467 --> 14:43.300
-Go ahead and step
in front of my car for me.
Nobody else in there?

14:43.333 --> 14:44.633
-No.
-Okay.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.967
-Is it about the--
I got a moving permit.

14:47.067 --> 14:48.767
-Okay.
Go ahead and put

14:48.800 --> 14:50.533
your hands behind your back.
I'm just gonna make sure

14:50.567 --> 14:52.733
you don't have any weapons
while we're talking to you.
No big deal.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.067
Go ahead and put
your hands behind your back.
There you go.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.433
The reason why
we pulled you over is 'cause
your vehicle's unregistered.

14:57.467 --> 14:58.800
Where you headed to?

14:58.833 --> 15:02.400
-Stratosphere.
My friend invited me
to the show "MJ Live".

15:02.433 --> 15:04.967
-Oh, okay.
Are you a musician?

15:05.067 --> 15:06.467
-Yes, ma'am.
-What do you play?

15:06.500 --> 15:08.633
-Guitar.
-What kind of guitar?

15:08.667 --> 15:10.300
-Awesome guitar.
-Oh. Very good.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.333
-I play at the Flamingo.
-Very good. Very good.

15:12.367 --> 15:14.733
-Stay here?
-Yep.

15:14.767 --> 15:16.800
Do you have anything illegal
on you at all?

15:16.833 --> 15:19.067
-No.
-How 'bout in the car?

15:19.067 --> 15:21.233
-No.
-No marijuana or anything
like that in the car?

15:21.267 --> 15:23.167
-No.
-I can smell it.

15:24.433 --> 15:26.967
So, you wanna--
you wanna lie to me some more?

15:27.067 --> 15:30.067
-No, I don't want to lie.
-Okay, so tell me the truth.
Have you ever--

15:30.067 --> 15:31.400
-I'm a guitar player.
-Okay.

15:31.433 --> 15:32.800
-I do smoke some marijuana.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.233
-The truth will set
you free, young man,

15:34.267 --> 15:35.333
'cause you have options.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.933
You can go to jail
or you can get a citation.

15:37.967 --> 15:39.067
Where is it?

15:39.067 --> 15:40.400
-It's in the glove.
It's next to it.

15:40.433 --> 15:42.267
-Okay. Put your knees
right up against that
for me, okay?

15:42.300 --> 15:44.067
What else am I gonna
find in there? Have a pipe?

15:44.100 --> 15:46.067
-Yeah.
-Okay. Hang tight
for a second.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.233
So you play some killer guitar
though, do ya?

15:48.267 --> 15:49.433
And you play
in a band here?

15:49.467 --> 15:51.800
-Yeah, I play
the Flamingo Hotel.
-All right.

15:51.833 --> 15:54.300
It's not a big deal.
Marijuana is probably
gonna be legal soon,

15:54.333 --> 15:55.700
but it is still illegal.

15:55.733 --> 15:57.967
-I know, I know, I know.
I want to cooperate.

15:58.067 --> 16:00.933
-You know.
-I'm not quite sure
I know what that's for.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.133
Looks like he's got several
different moving permits.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.333
We'll see if these
are legitimate or not.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.967
A lot of people think
marijuana is legal.

16:11.067 --> 16:13.467
However, in the state of Nevada,
it is still illegal.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.833
And even if he had
a medical marijuana card,

16:17.867 --> 16:19.200
he can't drive impaired.

16:19.233 --> 16:23.067
So basically when
we walked up to the car,

16:23.067 --> 16:25.333
that back window is just
cracked just enough

16:25.367 --> 16:27.500
that I could get
a whiff of marijuana.

16:27.533 --> 16:30.800
And, uh...
and it's strong.

16:30.833 --> 16:33.400
I could smell it
from the back.

16:33.433 --> 16:36.667
But right now, we've got
quite a bit amount of marijuana.

16:36.700 --> 16:38.933
How long ago
did you smoke?

16:38.967 --> 16:41.433
-An hour ago maybe.
-Man, this stuff is strong!

16:41.467 --> 16:43.367
-It's actually not.
-It's not?

16:43.400 --> 16:44.567
-No.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.067
-Where is your pipe?
'Cause I couldn't find it

16:46.067 --> 16:47.600
and I couldn't find
your driver's license.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.500
-Um, I can point it out to you.

16:49.533 --> 16:51.900
-Okay, so what's--
what's the deal

16:51.933 --> 16:54.067
with the plastic gun
under your seat?

16:54.067 --> 16:56.067
The BB gun,
little airsoft gun?

16:56.067 --> 16:57.733
-It's for a friend of mine.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.367
I got in in Chinatown
in L.A.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.967
It's just, like, a joke.

17:02.067 --> 17:03.867
-Oh. You be careful
with that, okay?

17:03.900 --> 17:04.900
-Yeah.

17:04.933 --> 17:07.167
-And he's got several permits.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.767
-I'm getting vintage plates in.

17:08.800 --> 17:12.300
-Okay, so this car was
registered at some point?

17:12.333 --> 17:14.500
-Four months.
That one should cover it
for four months.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.100
-So you already
ordered your plates?

17:16.133 --> 17:18.333
-Okay, I'm confused, Sis.
Explain to me.

17:18.367 --> 17:20.600
-He went down to register
his vehicle today

17:20.633 --> 17:24.367
and he registered it,
but because they're
personalized plates, it takes--

17:24.400 --> 17:26.300
-Oh, they gotta mail
them to him.
-They gotta mail them

17:26.333 --> 17:27.767
and it takes a while
for them to make 'em,

17:27.800 --> 17:29.333
so that's why he's got
the temporary tags.

17:29.367 --> 17:30.800
-Who did the car belong to
before you?

17:30.833 --> 17:33.233
-Cheryl...
I forget her last name.

17:33.267 --> 17:35.333
They're friends
of my friend.

17:35.367 --> 17:38.300
-Okay.
-Friends of the guy
I'm living with.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.500
-Okay.
-Let us do--

17:39.533 --> 17:41.100
-No warrants though, right?
-No.

17:41.133 --> 17:42.867
-Okay.
-Have you been arrested here?

17:42.900 --> 17:44.933
-No.
-Okay. Come on.
Stand up for me.

17:44.967 --> 17:48.067
I like you
'cause you're a happy guy.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.667
All right, what I'm gonna do
is I'mma put you right here
in front of the car.

17:51.700 --> 17:55.467
Don't take that marijuana.
It belongs to Metropolitan
Police Department now.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.833
But spread your feet.

17:56.867 --> 18:00.067
Okay, put this hand
on the back of your head
for me, okay?

18:00.100 --> 18:01.567
That one on the back
of your head.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.433
Okay, relax for me.

18:05.833 --> 18:08.167
-All right, James, we got
a confession to tell you.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.200
All right? We,
my sister and I,
are musicians as well.

18:11.233 --> 18:14.233
-Really?
-And we played all up
and down the Strip

18:14.267 --> 18:15.800
before we became
police officers.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.400
-That's so funny.
-So, we're--

18:17.433 --> 18:19.267
-So it's my lucky day.
-It's your lucky day.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.833
-I feel for you, okay?
-Yeah.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.300
-I'm gonna show you
something, all right?

18:23.333 --> 18:25.133
-Oh, nice.
-That's me.

18:25.167 --> 18:26.967
-Do we look alike?
-That's hilarious.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.133
-Is that not awesome?

18:28.167 --> 18:29.900
And I've been married
for 20 years

18:29.933 --> 18:31.567
and my husband is a drummer.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.433
And he played
in Air Supply for--

18:33.467 --> 18:35.567
-Keeping it all
in the family.
-For about 10 years.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.167
-Wow.
-And so he traveled the world

18:37.200 --> 18:40.333
and he currently plays
with the "Gordie Brown Show"

18:40.367 --> 18:42.700
-Oh, nice, nice.
-Over at the Golden Nugget.

18:42.733 --> 18:44.167
And so, keep it up.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.100
-Yeah, for sure.
-Stay out of this stuff.

18:46.133 --> 18:49.433
-Yeah.
-Trust me, we know
how musicians struggle.

18:49.467 --> 18:51.467
-Yeah.
-And good things happen
in this town.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.733
-Yeah.
-But going down this road,
you may not, you know.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.067
-Now the bad news.

18:56.067 --> 18:57.867
-Do the right thing, okay?
-Yeah, for sure.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.333
-All right? All right.
Today, you're gonna
get a citation,

19:00.367 --> 19:02.267
and it's possession of marijuana
under one ounce,

19:02.300 --> 19:04.433
so it's just a misdemeanor.
It's like getting
a speeding ticket.

19:04.467 --> 19:05.667
Okay? So, it's not
a big deal.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.800
-And please listen, James.

19:07.833 --> 19:09.600
-Here's your paperwork.

19:09.633 --> 19:12.700
-The biggest issue
is we have too is
that you're driving.

19:12.733 --> 19:15.467
-Yeah.
-Okay? I can tell that
you're not impaired right now,

19:15.500 --> 19:17.967
but what happens
when you get too much

19:18.067 --> 19:22.200
and you do wreck a car
or run into, you know,
our kids or our family.

19:22.233 --> 19:23.667
Just think about
those things, man.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.133
-No, for sure.
-Don't smoke in the car.

19:25.167 --> 19:26.467
-No.
-You know what I'm saying?

19:26.500 --> 19:28.933
All right. Don't have
so much on you.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.667
-(chuckles)
-All right, get out of here
and enjoy your show tonight.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.500
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-Good luck. Take care.

19:33.533 --> 19:35.967
-Awesome. I've never been
apprehended by a...

19:36.067 --> 19:38.500
-By twins before?
-By a duo of musicians.

19:38.533 --> 19:40.200
-(both laugh)
-Thank you. Thank you very much.

19:40.233 --> 19:41.933
-Take care. All right.
-Take care, man.

19:41.967 --> 19:43.800
-He learned his lesson.
-Let's hope so.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.067
-We weren't that bad,
were we?

19:45.067 --> 19:47.133
-No, we were, like, too scared
to do all that stuff.

19:47.167 --> 19:48.667
-I know.
-We just wanted to play music.

19:49.767 --> 19:51.933
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.967 --> 19:53.900
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.933 --> 19:55.067
Cover is code three.

19:55.100 --> 19:58.067
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.933 --> 20:06.900
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.933 --> 20:08.100
-(theme music playing)
