00:26.192 --> 00:29.404
YEAR: 2037
SPACE SHIP: MCS NOVA RED

00:29.529 --> 00:35.410
PURPOSE OF THE MISSION:
REPLACE THE SPACE

00:58.892 --> 01:00.292
Are you coming with me.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.213
What I can not do all.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.592
I have to work.

02:16.594 --> 02:20.140
This was work.
- You may need a prosthesis?

02:21.224 --> 02:25.020
For better endurance.
- I promised you seven minutes.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.689
So it was only
five minutes too little.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.400
You are moving forward.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.030
Those things will still kill you.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.784
That's what my father always said.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.956
The last package, then I quit.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.357
Promised.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.279
Do I see you later?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.157
You will hear from me.

03:11.358 --> 03:15.487
Uncle Fen.
- Damn, what is this?

03:17.697 --> 03:21.076
The commander wants to talk to you - now.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.245
Can I take a shower first?
- No.

03:31.252 --> 03:34.381
Remember, my job is at stake.

03:34.631 --> 03:39.219
Your answers must be short and
to be sincere. But especially short.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.495
I will.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.308
Thank you ... for this opportunity.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.811
Thank me later.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.232
By the way, we have one
new science officer.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.942
Do not try to stare.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.320
What's with Corrigan?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.364
He shot himself.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.284
Captain Fen, major Mason.
We want to go to the commander.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.899
Rest on the place, gentlemen.

04:14.129 --> 04:17.589
This is our new one
science officer, Aurora Owon.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.616
Let's keep it short.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.805
Our scanners have one
unknown planet discovered ...

04:23.930 --> 04:27.267
and navigating the ship within reach.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.563
What does that mean?
- That someone has to lead an expedition ...

04:31.646 --> 04:33.815
and find out
whether the planet is habitable.

04:34.566 --> 04:38.737
I offer myself.
- You have never led an expedition.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.282
No. No sir.

04:42.365 --> 04:45.618
I know the father through my father
demands through and through.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.372
The corps does not have much anymore
men like him. Scandalous.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.916
Consolated with your loss.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.650
Thank you, sir.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.588
You were not my first choice, major.

04:57.589 --> 05:01.301
But all leading
expedition leaders are already on mission.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.846
You say, he's ready, Fen?
- It's him.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.974
In officer Corrigan's log
is a violent incident ...

05:08.099 --> 05:10.435
with a medical
android.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.438
Sir, the technique frustrates
us all once.

05:13.563 --> 05:18.485
Apparently Corrigan was not
always a stable person.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.864
Major Mason never has
unnecessary aggression ...

05:22.989 --> 05:26.326
towards someone with
a living heart.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.663
You understand what management means?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.333
In spite of everything, complete the mission.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.377
I know the rules.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.297
Keep him in line, Fen.

05:40.548 --> 05:44.177
Aurora will be a preparatory
keep briefing.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.638
Meeting about four hours in EOC.

05:47.013 --> 05:50.225
I am further developing the team.
Gritted.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.042
Thanks.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.784
On courageous souls and new worlds!

06:13.915 --> 06:15.458
Thank you, John.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.714
She will miss me.

06:24.592 --> 06:28.054
Never underestimate
the unknown, boy.

06:28.596 --> 06:31.599
Certainly not the women.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.941
Do not you want to say goodbye?

06:40.775 --> 06:42.175
She is busy.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.487
Who do you tell that.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.449
This is probably your last chance.

06:57.334 --> 07:01.046
Hey, Dez. Let everything stand and
lie down and come to my cabin.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.507
I owe you five minutes.
- I can not.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.219
But I will miss you.
I might come pick you up.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.472
And if I do not come back?

07:16.561 --> 07:20.023
I'm not talking to you.
Come on, Dez.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.735
Hey, guys!

07:23.902 --> 07:25.302
Do not worry, this old ...

07:29.699 --> 07:31.099
Stop!

07:49.427 --> 07:52.013
Oh, this was a bit exaggerated.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.933
What the hell !?

07:59.145 --> 08:02.107
What? This is not a person.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.818
It is broken, not dead.

08:27.173 --> 08:31.594
You would say goodbye to her,
do not get a beating.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.640
The advice was a bit vague.
As always.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.666
Here.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.918
Thanks.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.942
Did your father tell you
what happened to the pioneer camp?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.280
It was closed.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.492
Yes, you can hear that
during history lesson.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.339
We received an emergency call.

09:08.631 --> 09:12.302
Your father and I are there
voluntarily go to ...

09:12.427 --> 09:14.763
to sort out the case.

09:15.347 --> 09:18.308
What happened,
seem buried - as always.

09:20.226 --> 09:24.230
Our expedition leader has
a pickaxe caught ...

09:25.857 --> 09:30.820
and the bellies of his pilots
and science officer torn open.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.449
Nobody knows why.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.952
It came totally unexpected.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.997
He nearly killed me.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.963
This saved my life.

09:58.848 --> 10:03.520
Why are you giving me this?
- Because you now have the responsibility.

10:06.564 --> 10:10.610
Trust only your intuition.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.155
And this.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.784
Then you are prepared for everything.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.122
And everyone.

10:27.127 --> 10:31.381
But, my advice is always vague.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.010
Now I have to clean up your mess.

12:27.872 --> 12:32.335
Expedition Vanguard has, like
usual, three main goals.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.380
Goal one: explore
or suitable for colonization.

12:35.505 --> 12:39.259
Two: explore or raw materials
available for economic use.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.262
Three: we accomplish the mission ...

12:42.345 --> 12:46.016
which means everyone
back home safely on the ship.

12:46.683 --> 12:50.770
Vanguard will go out as usual
a scout team of six men exist.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.400
My advice, Captain:
a cup of firm coffee before departure.

12:56.484 --> 13:01.614
After the landing, the major takes the command
over for the rest of the stay.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.576
How long does the stay last?
- Approximately 4,000 hours.

13:04.659 --> 13:08.913
Until NOVA returns to the port.
- These rangers are under your authority.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.960
If you are there
encounter problems ...

13:14.169 --> 13:16.036
it will not be a problem for long.

13:16.671 --> 13:20.091
And with that I give the floor
to your science officer.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.616
Thanks, commander.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.305
The planet has an E-type system.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.391
The core ensures ideal
gravity and atmosphere.

13:28.558 --> 13:32.062
An asteroid ring and a few moons:
One with reverse orbit.

13:32.187 --> 13:36.524
One with a metal surface that the
Sun reflects and her rotation follows.

13:36.941 --> 13:41.029
The planet is especially cold desert,
so we are going to wear isolation suits.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.073
Also in frame?
- Yes.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.826
Optimization through prostheses
remains your own choice.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.829
The corps is asking for one
minimum standardization ...

13:49.954 --> 13:52.665
so you too without
upgrades can work.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.212
Polar ice caps, snow in
higher areas.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.006
We are going into a seemingly
fertile valley countries.

14:00.090 --> 14:03.009
First scans allow vegetation
and see organic life.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.554
Hostile?
- You are going to see it.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.558
Good.
Your shuttle is waiting in the departure bay.

14:11.351 --> 14:15.188
Complete the mission. Gritted.

14:53.643 --> 14:57.480
The expedition team to
hangar B for further instruction.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.764
Locking open.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.520
I do not like this,
then I will sweat me to death.

15:37.604 --> 15:41.483
Now it does not have to be done yet.
But on the planet it is mandatory.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.657
You really need an upgrade.

15:49.741 --> 15:52.952
My weapon is without a doubt
more powerful than that little thing.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.289
I love my revolver. It is easy.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.249
But it only has five bullets.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.796
Can you see my baby?
There can be 200 in it.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.757
Size is decisive.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.367
She knows that.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.411
Know what?

16:11.805 --> 16:15.934
I am there when you need something.
- Good to know, thanks.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.603
Come, Boka,
leave the lovebirds alone.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.622
Can I help you?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.065
No.

16:42.377 --> 16:43.777
No.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.489
Captain.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.972
Okay, let's warm up.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.392
I have already been warmed up.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.584
Coffee, right?

17:01.604 --> 17:03.356
We're all going to die.

17:12.615 --> 17:16.368
OK. Pull it, John!

17:18.872 --> 17:20.373
"Pull it," sir?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.542
We have not yet landed.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.047
Vanguard crew, sit down before departure.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.382
Ready.

17:42.645 --> 17:46.566
We are prepared, Captain.
- Well, prepare for separation.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.444
The countdown is running.
- EC pressure level?

17:50.445 --> 17:54.824
Stable at 7,000 psi.
- Let us know if anything changes.

17:54.949 --> 17:58.995
Deactivate the lock of
the lock and the central lock.

17:59.871 --> 18:02.707
Eh, Captain. Pressure seal?

18:05.418 --> 18:08.129
Thanks.
- 8, 7 ...

18:09.923 --> 18:11.299
5 ...
- Deactivated.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.761
4 ...
- And we are ...

18:15.387 --> 18:17.806
Sluice opening initiated.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.624
Ready.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.008
Now the fun is about to begin.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.095
Come on, bring her down!

18:57.512 --> 18:58.912
Yes, sir.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.398
NOVA, check the connection.

19:08.523 --> 19:11.109
How is the receipt?
- I hear you loud and clear.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.153
From here everything is okay. About.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.429
Achieve interspace.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.059
Turbulence!

19:26.499 --> 19:28.043
What did we hit?

19:28.418 --> 19:32.088
The high atmosphere.
Hold on, we're going down quickly.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.572
15,000.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.344
14,000, 13,000.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.578
OK.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.765
10, 8 ...

19:43.308 --> 19:45.477
6, 5 ...

19:45.977 --> 19:49.189
Correct something, correct something.
Take some power away.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.467
3.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.488
What was that?
- One engine has been drowned.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.323
Landing gear on stand-by.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.536
NOVA, this is Vanguard.
This is going to be a hard landing.

20:03.912 --> 20:08.249
Captain, your guide beacon is off.
- Landing gear! Landing gear!

20:14.547 --> 20:18.510
Damn! The ventral motor and
the meerklampen are out of order.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.595
Hold on, this gets rough!

20:28.269 --> 20:30.146
Let me send you manually!
- Certainly?

20:30.271 --> 20:31.856
Give me total control!

20:32.732 --> 20:34.150
Here it is.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.320
Okay, we're going to be as low as possible.

20:38.279 --> 20:41.825
And then comes a belly landing.
I am just being honest.

20:42.534 --> 20:45.120
Landing gear from and
reversed thrust.

20:45.495 --> 20:50.083
In 3, 2, 1!

21:50.935 --> 21:53.271
Something different.
- Do you want another time?

21:54.564 --> 21:57.442
NOVA, here is Vanguard.
The landing was perfect.

21:57.525 --> 22:00.278
Understood? About.
- Everyone in order?

22:06.493 --> 22:09.829
Everything okay, honey?
- Do not you like flying?

22:10.497 --> 22:13.249
Why would you think that?
- Amateur.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.056
Is that wind?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.827
Sounds ...
- strange.

22:48.952 --> 22:54.374
Well, or we'll get used to it
or not. Hey, there she goes.

23:07.470 --> 23:10.932
OK. Captain Fen,
look at the generator.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.934
Has the tracker survived the landing?

23:13.435 --> 23:14.728
Officer Owon.

23:14.811 --> 23:18.648
Prepare the cameras for demarcation.
Go online with the lab.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.174
Area secured.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.486
Rangers, we're going for a walk.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.686
Here are roads everywhere.
- Yes really.

23:56.811 --> 24:01.024
Why are there roads?
- No idea. Perhaps an earlier ...

24:01.483 --> 24:02.883
Oh!

24:05.653 --> 24:06.988
A dead plant.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.116
In fact, in a kind
from hibernation.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.870
According to carbon content
three million hours.

24:14.329 --> 24:15.729
And?

24:16.915 --> 24:19.709
That is three times longer
then you will live.

24:20.001 --> 24:21.670
What do you know about me?

24:21.795 --> 24:23.713
Not this attitude, Boka.
- What?

24:24.631 --> 24:26.716
Is there a reason for this lesson?

24:26.925 --> 24:30.637
It seems to be waiting for water.
Out of respect we should not ...

24:33.098 --> 24:35.600
What the hell is that?

24:41.022 --> 24:44.526
Nobody activates his weapon
without my order!

24:48.071 --> 24:49.471
Is that clear?

24:50.281 --> 24:55.203
Major, I suggest that we go further.
Boka, you're leading the way.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.396
Yes, sir.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.775
It was only a test.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.528
Unbelievable, that there are 32
made of it.

25:29.904 --> 25:33.533
The lab is online,
the base is running at full speed.

25:33.908 --> 25:39.080
In connection with the landing I had to ...
- With your autopilot we were ...

25:39.581 --> 25:42.000
now both are no longer alive.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.376
Yes, sir.

25:43.501 --> 25:47.339
I did not want you with the outage
of the damper. I apologize.

25:48.506 --> 25:52.469
Listen, machines fail.

25:54.012 --> 25:55.412
Again and again.

25:58.016 --> 25:59.809
These wheels should turn.

26:00.393 --> 26:04.439
I can help.
- Quiet, honey, that's men's work.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.858
If only I knew where the jack ...

26:14.324 --> 26:17.577
Beware, machines fail again and again.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.369
NOVA, all systems running. About.

26:59.452 --> 27:02.789
Understood, Vanguard. The following
We are in action for 30 minutes.

27:06.418 --> 27:08.878
There is power. Do we have water?

27:08.962 --> 27:11.756
I would like a drink.
- Me too.

27:11.881 --> 27:13.633
Boka, I need to talk to you.

27:17.137 --> 27:20.557
Understood, we'll save us.
God bless NOVA. Vanguard out.

27:21.349 --> 27:22.767
Give him a chance.

27:23.268 --> 27:25.937
4,000 hours. From now.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.026
Have you seen something special?

27:34.654 --> 27:36.448
A number of ancient ruins.

27:37.866 --> 27:39.266
Some rocks.

27:39.534 --> 27:42.245
You get used to it.
- Yes or no.

27:48.335 --> 27:51.129
Do you have something?
- Yes, major, listen ...

27:51.755 --> 27:53.423
I'm sorry about it.

27:54.215 --> 27:58.094
It was inappropriate and
will not happen again, sir.

27:59.763 --> 28:01.163
OK.

28:09.647 --> 28:13.651
Now I know what you mean by
'Never underestimate the unknown'.

28:18.114 --> 28:19.657
4,000 hours.

28:40.428 --> 28:43.264
Okay, I'll be right back.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.365
I will keep an eye on things.

29:03.076 --> 29:05.078
Okay, I'm on location 5.

29:05.161 --> 29:06.996
All right, sir, everything according to schedule.

29:38.361 --> 29:41.031
With this you can shave.
- Thanks.

29:44.159 --> 29:45.559
Pretty sharp.

29:46.161 --> 29:47.871
What have I just told you?

29:48.121 --> 29:51.041
You are an idiot.
A fight with you would be funny.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.585
Can you see me?
- Better give it back.

29:53.668 --> 29:56.713
Loud and clear, sir.
- I need a patch.

29:57.422 --> 29:59.507
It goes, almost no blood anymore.

29:59.924 --> 30:03.511
All five inside view.
- OK. I'm going back.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.381
I shoot too low.

30:17.317 --> 30:20.320
Is that because of my sight ...
or the weapon?

30:32.791 --> 30:34.209
Your vision.

30:35.543 --> 30:37.128
Let Aurora examine you.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.862
Gladly.

30:43.802 --> 30:47.347
OUTSIDE CAMERA 01
PANORAMA TRANSMISSION

30:47.430 --> 30:51.017
OUTSIDE CAMERA 02
PANORAMA TRANSMISSION

30:51.851 --> 30:54.896
Okay, done.

30:55.897 --> 30:59.317
Will I agree with the Stryker
pack and test?

31:01.611 --> 31:03.011
Captain?

31:03.405 --> 31:05.490
Something is not right with this planet.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.063
How do you mean?

31:16.418 --> 31:18.253
Would you like to live here?

31:22.590 --> 31:24.509
We should adapt.

31:25.385 --> 31:28.471
Or the planet to us.

31:34.019 --> 31:35.419
Besides...

31:36.396 --> 31:38.440
you know she's synthetic, right?

31:57.876 --> 31:59.836
You must keep your processor clean.

32:00.170 --> 32:03.631
Hey, do I have to say that?
I'm a dirty guy.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.885
It is the vitreous humor in your eye cavity.

32:07.010 --> 32:09.429
The liquid
forms a blockade.

32:09.596 --> 32:11.306
Do you help me?

32:12.057 --> 32:15.143
do you help me
lose the fluid?

32:17.604 --> 32:19.814
I want to keep looking.
- Me too.

32:24.736 --> 32:26.136
Seductive.

32:32.827 --> 32:35.580
This can hurt.
- Oh, stop, stop, stop!

32:38.750 --> 32:40.150
Klote.

32:42.837 --> 32:44.237
Not fun, boys.

32:46.299 --> 32:47.717
Not funny at all.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.536
What?

32:53.890 --> 32:57.143
You are far outside and
bounces on an asteroid belt.

32:57.936 --> 33:00.271
Someone is going to
the mechanic and asks:

33:00.939 --> 33:04.067
'As one of the oxygen tanks
tears through a rock ...

33:04.943 --> 33:06.903
how long before we suffocate? "

33:07.987 --> 33:09.489
The mechanic says:

33:10.573 --> 33:12.075
'The rest of your life.'

33:14.619 --> 33:17.122
Do not tell that joke anymore.
- Tomorrow, so.

33:17.372 --> 33:20.458
Today is tomorrow, guests. Look!

33:27.841 --> 33:29.241
Was that a quake?

33:29.592 --> 33:32.012
There were a number
the last hours.

33:33.179 --> 33:34.579
Is that serious?

33:34.764 --> 33:39.102
Many small tremors ensure
less pressure. That is better for us.

33:53.324 --> 33:54.724
They are birds.

35:13.863 --> 35:17.158
Uncle Fen, we want the
view ruins.

35:18.493 --> 35:21.996
Are you coming?
- These rocks move.

35:22.997 --> 35:24.397
What?

35:25.375 --> 35:28.378
What? Oh, no, no, I like it here.

35:29.671 --> 35:31.881
I am waiting for the birds to come back.

35:33.466 --> 35:36.803
At home the birds eat the worms, sir.

36:51.628 --> 36:54.506
Something has activated camera 4.
Do you want to see it?

36:56.091 --> 36:57.491
What is it this time?

37:00.720 --> 37:02.555
Another giant animal?

37:03.640 --> 37:05.558
They respond to the earthquakes.

37:07.852 --> 37:09.252
I do not see anything at all.

37:10.146 --> 37:11.546
There it is.

37:12.524 --> 37:13.924
Insert grid.

37:15.026 --> 37:17.237
Expand field R8-C20.

37:19.322 --> 37:20.722
Sharper.

37:21.991 --> 37:23.391
Nothing yet.

37:24.744 --> 37:26.144
The rock?

37:26.871 --> 37:28.915
Increase 200 percent.

37:37.716 --> 37:39.801
At least they do it.

37:54.482 --> 37:56.276
How did we miss this stream?

37:59.320 --> 38:02.240
The quakes may have
a source laid free.

38:02.365 --> 38:06.077
Hey, hey! Do not touch!

38:06.995 --> 38:08.395
Do not worry.

38:10.457 --> 38:12.125
I'm not going to cook you yet.

38:13.626 --> 38:16.880
That was it.
Aurora now has enough test material.

38:17.714 --> 38:19.114
Let's go.

38:58.004 --> 38:59.589
Hey, Sato, are you coming?

39:00.048 --> 39:01.448
Yes.

39:32.163 --> 39:33.748
Very strange.

39:37.669 --> 39:40.588
It was here.
- I've seen it anyway.

39:41.631 --> 39:43.675
We all have.

39:45.135 --> 39:48.304
Perhaps Captain Fen is right.
- By which?

39:49.556 --> 39:51.933
He said the rocks are moving.
- Just hold on...

39:53.476 --> 39:54.876
For real?

39:59.649 --> 40:01.401
Nature shocks? Or worse?

40:02.027 --> 40:04.154
Another kind of giant worm?

40:12.787 --> 40:14.372
Yes, the rocks move.

40:16.124 --> 40:17.917
Officer Owon, do you hear me?

40:18.001 --> 40:20.920
Yes, sir. There were two shocks.
Everything fine?

40:21.004 --> 40:23.882
Everything good.
We come back to the base.

40:24.090 --> 40:26.634
Okay, sir. We are expecting you
in 30 minutes.

40:48.281 --> 40:49.741
Sato!

40:50.033 --> 40:51.433
Down here!

40:54.579 --> 40:55.979
Goes well with me.

40:56.331 --> 40:57.731
Hold on!

40:59.376 --> 41:00.776
Get me out of here.

41:02.170 --> 41:03.570
Watch out!

41:05.507 --> 41:08.093
To hold!
- I've got it.

41:10.470 --> 41:11.870
You can do this.

41:28.279 --> 41:29.679
Oh, shit.

41:32.242 --> 41:33.660
Everything will be fine, come!

41:34.202 --> 41:36.788
Hold on to me.
It works!

41:36.871 --> 41:38.873
Come ... come on!

41:43.545 --> 41:44.945
And go!

41:53.013 --> 41:56.266
Major, we are online again.
What's with Sato?

41:56.641 --> 41:59.936
No idea. He fell from a slope.
- Was he injured?

42:00.061 --> 42:03.273
No I do not know,
I do not think so. He is outside of the west.

42:06.526 --> 42:07.944
Damn, Aurora!

42:11.156 --> 42:12.365
Help me!

42:12.657 --> 42:14.659
Rondeau, ahead!
- I follow you closely.

42:23.585 --> 42:26.087
The door does not open!
- Let me agree!

42:31.217 --> 42:32.617
What the hell !?

42:35.180 --> 42:37.807
Open the door, Aurora!
- He can not enter.

42:37.932 --> 42:40.560
If he is infected,
everyone will become infected.

42:40.935 --> 42:42.335
Aurora!

42:42.729 --> 42:44.129
Damn!

42:45.607 --> 42:48.109
What the fuck?
- Aurora, open the door!

42:48.234 --> 42:50.904
No, that goes against it
Discovery-Corps protocol.

42:51.071 --> 42:53.948
Sato needs help!
- Open the damn door!

42:54.032 --> 42:56.785
That is an order!
- You do not think clearly.

42:56.868 --> 42:58.620
We can not take the risk!

42:59.579 --> 43:01.247
Open that damn door!

43:01.581 --> 43:04.292
Open the door, Aurora!

43:04.376 --> 43:06.795
Open, immediately!

43:08.505 --> 43:10.590
Aurora, open the door!

43:30.527 --> 43:32.195
I'm fine, okay?

43:32.821 --> 43:34.739
Fine, just a little headache.

43:35.448 --> 43:37.951
It's my head, it, the ...

43:38.284 --> 43:40.245
I hear a bell in my head.

43:40.870 --> 43:44.624
His prostheses and the organic system
work as normal.

43:45.291 --> 43:47.919
The blood test is coming.
- It's fine with me.

43:48.003 --> 43:51.256
Sato ...
- Fine! It is fine!

43:51.589 --> 43:54.551
Leave me alone. It is fine.
- Watch him.

43:55.176 --> 43:56.576
For real?

43:57.679 --> 44:00.974
It's my head.
It's going fine ...

44:02.142 --> 44:03.542
Calm down.
- Everything good.

44:04.978 --> 44:08.106
That was against the protocol.
- I saved a life.

44:08.231 --> 44:11.151
And put us in danger.
- It was the right decision.

44:11.276 --> 44:12.819
A person would understand.

44:14.696 --> 44:17.240
You have something
irresponsibly, sir.

44:19.784 --> 44:21.327
We found water.

44:22.245 --> 44:23.645
I get the samples.

44:27.250 --> 44:28.960
Do not drink from the water.

44:41.806 --> 44:45.769
If this is over you will be harder
to make decisions, sir.

44:46.519 --> 44:48.146
There was no danger.

44:52.734 --> 44:54.277
There's something wrong.

44:54.652 --> 44:58.073
Apart from the giant worm,
the earthquakes and the weird weather?

44:59.616 --> 45:01.117
What happened to Sato?

45:02.202 --> 45:03.870
No idea.
- That's your job!

45:04.120 --> 45:06.247
That's why Aurora is researching him.

45:06.748 --> 45:10.877
We need a strong leader.
The men are also my responsibility.

45:11.252 --> 45:14.005
Do your work. I'm doing mine.

45:21.221 --> 45:22.305
Where is Fen?

45:22.639 --> 45:24.391
Perhaps walking?

45:25.350 --> 45:26.750
Uncle Fen?

45:29.562 --> 45:30.962
Uncle Fen!

45:37.362 --> 45:39.781
His blood is fine.
- Which is good.

45:42.033 --> 45:43.910
Shall I give you something to eat, ranger?

45:46.996 --> 45:48.581
So that it gets even worse?

45:55.171 --> 45:56.571
Uncle Fen!

45:57.924 --> 45:59.324
Uncle Fen!

45:59.843 --> 46:01.594
He is gone.
- We do not know that.

46:01.928 --> 46:04.639
He is not here.
- Camera 3 is recording.

46:07.809 --> 46:09.209
I do not see anything.

46:11.062 --> 46:12.462
Repeat the clip.

46:15.358 --> 46:16.484
There it is.

46:16.818 --> 46:19.446
OUTSIDE CAMERA 03
PANORAMA TRANSMISSION

46:19.529 --> 46:22.323
SUBJECT / CLASSIFICATION /
TYPE / DANGER: UNKNOWN

46:24.075 --> 46:25.809
Nothing to see on the remaining channels.

46:27.120 --> 46:28.538
It is within the area.

46:29.497 --> 46:30.897
Okay, we're going.

46:35.420 --> 46:36.838
I can stay better here.

46:38.131 --> 46:40.467
Yes. Is probably better.

46:43.553 --> 46:45.680
I ... I feel fine. Really.

46:46.681 --> 46:48.558
Really, it's much better.

46:49.893 --> 46:52.103
I know,
I do not look, but ...

46:54.189 --> 46:57.192
I feel fine.
I can keep an eye on the monitors.

46:58.943 --> 47:01.529
What does the blood test say?
- I have examined everything.

47:02.447 --> 47:05.909
No idea, but his
bodily functions are normal again.

47:08.370 --> 47:09.829
I am following you.

47:11.247 --> 47:15.043
You stay and watch him.
And on the monitors.

47:15.669 --> 47:17.069
Major.

47:18.171 --> 47:19.631
Time to prove yourself.

47:22.926 --> 47:24.326
I am doing fine.

47:25.762 --> 47:27.162
I feel fine.

47:28.473 --> 47:29.873
It is fine.

47:30.266 --> 47:31.666
Captain Fen!

47:34.521 --> 47:36.398
Here are a lot of traces.

47:38.817 --> 47:40.217
Everything done.

47:40.819 --> 47:42.219
Let's split up!

47:46.116 --> 47:47.534
Uncle Fen!

47:49.452 --> 47:50.852
Captain!

47:52.664 --> 47:54.457
Captain Fen!

48:04.801 --> 48:06.344
Uncle Fen!

48:33.872 --> 48:35.415
Captain Fen!

48:55.352 --> 48:56.752
Captain Fen?

49:00.357 --> 49:02.525
Captain!
- Uncle Fen!

49:51.491 --> 49:53.785
Boka? Everything fine?

49:54.577 --> 49:58.581
Yes, everything is good.
I was only a bit shocked.

50:03.294 --> 50:04.694
Captain!

50:21.855 --> 50:23.481
Uncle Fen!

50:25.942 --> 50:27.342
Shit!

51:02.062 --> 51:04.731
What do you think Sato has?
- I do not know.

51:05.231 --> 51:09.027
He is certainly not healthy.
- He behaves strangely, so differently.

51:11.404 --> 51:15.367
Fen must have left the area.
- Then it would be in the picture.

51:15.450 --> 51:18.661
Wherever he is, we will find him.

51:18.828 --> 51:23.333
Eat, sleep and when you come again
Being fit is what we are looking for.

51:24.292 --> 51:25.692
OK.

51:27.796 --> 51:29.297
What's with your hand?

51:36.513 --> 51:39.432
It's in my head,
it burns in my head!

51:39.933 --> 51:42.519
Go back, go back!

51:43.061 --> 51:44.461
Go back.

51:45.271 --> 51:47.899
Nobody is there, no, no, no, no.

51:50.485 --> 51:51.885
No!

51:52.570 --> 51:55.448
Quiet.
- Back! Away!

51:55.740 --> 51:59.160
Go back! Back!
It's in my head!

51:59.285 --> 52:00.685
Sato ... Sato.

52:04.290 --> 52:06.042
Ranger ...
- Everything will be fine.

52:17.470 --> 52:21.975
Yes, now I feel better.
Much better.

52:23.601 --> 52:26.146
This is much better.
- I can help you.

52:26.646 --> 52:28.648
Ranger, knife away, this is an order!

52:31.151 --> 52:33.153
Take him off that damn knife!

52:33.278 --> 52:34.988
Do it yourself!

52:56.092 --> 52:59.346
Nobody touches anything.

53:02.724 --> 53:04.225
What happened outside?

53:04.559 --> 53:07.687
I do not know.
- How can you not know?

53:07.812 --> 53:11.900
We took samples at the stream.
One earthquake and he was gone.

53:12.025 --> 53:13.537
Did he drink from the water?

53:14.527 --> 53:16.696
I do not know.
- I have to investigate it.

53:16.821 --> 53:19.657
Now? We have to bury him.

53:19.991 --> 53:21.326
No.
- No?

53:21.409 --> 53:23.787
We burn him.
- We're burying our dead!

53:23.912 --> 53:27.749
And if he was infected?
- I will not take any risks.

53:28.500 --> 53:32.295
Do it.
- Sato was a Discovery Corps Ranger!

53:32.379 --> 53:35.256
You do not tell us how ...
- I'm in charge.

53:36.549 --> 53:39.719
Burn the body.
This is an order.

53:48.520 --> 53:52.357
Aurora, clean the entire cabin.
Everything must be clean.

53:53.775 --> 53:55.193
I keep looking for Fen.

53:55.819 --> 53:58.446
We have to form teams,
in shifts.

53:58.571 --> 54:01.366
Good. Boka, come with me.

54:02.659 --> 54:05.829
This expedition is fucked!
- I know. Boka?

54:06.413 --> 54:07.813
Pay attention!

55:25.825 --> 55:28.203
Exactly, go soon.

55:43.134 --> 55:46.513
Sir, I can work the hours here
barely count outside.

55:49.683 --> 55:51.351
We can go back better.

55:54.187 --> 55:57.941
OK. In two minutes
I see you at the vehicle.

55:58.983 --> 56:00.383
Understood.

56:04.280 --> 56:05.699
I'm already there, sir.

56:08.952 --> 56:10.352
For how long?

56:10.745 --> 56:12.145
A while.

56:14.541 --> 56:16.584
I look around one last time.

56:17.961 --> 56:19.379
Fine.

56:27.220 --> 56:28.722
Uncle Fen!

56:37.772 --> 56:39.190
That was necessary.

57:08.845 --> 57:11.097
Major, do you hear me?
- I hear you.

57:12.474 --> 57:14.059
Here's something, sir.

57:15.560 --> 57:17.687
Is it captain Fen?
- No.

57:18.855 --> 57:20.357
It is something else.

57:21.441 --> 57:23.026
Damn it, Boka, what is it?

57:24.194 --> 57:28.448
It's disguised, sir.
Fixed one of the creatures.

57:29.366 --> 57:32.118
Is it hostile?
- Not yet.

57:32.327 --> 57:36.206
Leave it alone.
- It seems to be eating.

57:36.664 --> 57:39.542
And what then?
- Your own kind of fellow, sir.

57:40.001 --> 57:41.544
Now it is staring at me.

57:46.174 --> 57:49.427
Okay I am on my way.
- Boka, do not do stupid things!

57:50.387 --> 57:51.805
Move.

57:55.183 --> 57:56.583
Boka!

57:59.896 --> 58:01.296
Boka!

58:05.610 --> 58:07.010
Damn!

58:07.404 --> 58:08.804
Boka!

58:09.197 --> 58:11.282
What happened?
- Missed.

58:11.866 --> 58:13.743
Were you attacked?
- No.

58:13.868 --> 58:15.495
Why did you shoot?

58:16.037 --> 58:17.437
I'm at the vehicle.

58:18.248 --> 58:21.209
Damn you, do you hear me?
- Yes, I can hear you.

58:21.334 --> 58:24.254
I hear you. I do not care.

58:24.379 --> 58:26.297
Come, back, we're going away here!

58:29.801 --> 58:31.201
Boka!

58:46.401 --> 58:47.801
Boka!

58:49.446 --> 58:50.846
Boka!

58:52.449 --> 58:53.849
Boka!

58:55.243 --> 58:56.643
Boka!

59:09.924 --> 59:10.967
I have got you.

59:11.134 --> 59:13.094
Everything is fine, I am here.

59:15.263 --> 59:16.663
I have got you.

59:22.645 --> 59:24.189
Aurora is going to patch you up again.

59:25.690 --> 59:27.090
Everything will be fine.

59:40.163 --> 59:41.563
I have got you.

59:43.333 --> 59:45.043
Aurora is going to patch you up.

59:46.836 --> 59:48.421
She's going to take care of you.

01:01:44.245 --> 01:01:45.645
And?

01:01:46.414 --> 01:01:48.208
What happened to Boka?

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:52.045
I already said, I do not know.
Something has attacked him.

01:01:52.212 --> 01:01:56.758
That is nonsense! How can you
sit under the blood ...

01:01:56.883 --> 01:02:00.387
and do not have a scratch?
- All right, Rondeau.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.265
It was an accident.
- An accident?

01:02:04.391 --> 01:02:05.791
I shot him.

01:02:07.268 --> 01:02:09.854
Down with it, Rondeau!
- All weapons down.

01:02:09.938 --> 01:02:12.899
He has known a murder!
- I did not kill Boka!

01:02:12.982 --> 01:02:15.110
Something has attacked him. Down now!

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:19.197
That will not happen!
- We have to figure this out!

01:02:19.948 --> 01:02:23.284
Listen, Rondeau.
I'll take you to him.

01:02:23.576 --> 01:02:26.955
I can not trust him, no more.
- I have the solution.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.083
But lower your weapon.

01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:35.213
I know how to know the truth.

01:02:50.353 --> 01:02:51.753
Terrible.

01:02:52.647 --> 01:02:55.608
It was not murder.
Something has attacked him.

01:02:55.817 --> 01:02:57.902
It was a terrible accident.

01:02:59.946 --> 01:03:02.490
We have to be
remove the memory card.

01:03:02.615 --> 01:03:04.868
So that Discovery Corps
can read it out.

01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:08.538
Major, can I borrow your knife?
- Now?

01:03:08.663 --> 01:03:10.248
That's how it goes faster.

01:03:14.669 --> 01:03:16.588
This is not pleasant to see.

01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:32.562
Lieutenant Boka, the Discovery Corps
thank you for your loyal service.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.300
Rondeau.

01:03:54.584 --> 01:03:56.211
Rondeau. Rondeau!

01:03:58.088 --> 01:04:00.256
I am going to view the recordings myself.

01:04:00.382 --> 01:04:02.926
I do my best, as far as possible.

01:04:03.009 --> 01:04:04.719
Camera 3 is recording.

01:04:05.595 --> 01:04:07.514
It is certainly ...
- It's Captain Fen!

01:04:10.558 --> 01:04:12.268
That was 15 minutes ago.

01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:16.606
OUTSIDE CAMERA 04
PANORAMA TRANSMISSION

01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.609
Rondeau, come.
- Without medicine?

01:04:19.693 --> 01:04:22.821
Rondeau will direct it.
Come on!

01:04:54.227 --> 01:04:55.627
There is the camera!

01:04:59.524 --> 01:05:01.317
Uncle Fen!
- Captain!

01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:04.320
Where are you?
- Captain Fen!

01:05:04.404 --> 01:05:07.449
Uncle Fen!
- Sir, a lot of trouble.

01:05:10.452 --> 01:05:11.953
We have seen him!

01:05:12.579 --> 01:05:13.979
Captain!

01:05:14.831 --> 01:05:16.231
Uncle Fen!

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.275
Fen!

01:05:30.347 --> 01:05:32.098
Captain Fen!

01:05:40.857 --> 01:05:42.257
Uncle Fen!

01:05:42.484 --> 01:05:43.884
Damn!

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:54.162
Uncle Fen!

01:06:00.377 --> 01:06:01.777
Captain.

01:06:02.879 --> 01:06:04.839
No no.

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:07.509
You have to kill me and run away!

01:06:07.592 --> 01:06:10.679
You have to be calm,
calm down.

01:06:10.804 --> 01:06:13.306
Oh no, no!
- Uncle...

01:06:15.308 --> 01:06:16.976
Go!
- My heaven.

01:06:17.644 --> 01:06:19.604
You have to listen to me.
- Kill me!

01:06:20.397 --> 01:06:22.607
Pick him up,
we take him to the base.

01:06:22.816 --> 01:06:25.819
Good. Uncle Fen ...
- No, no, they are everywhere!

01:06:25.944 --> 01:06:29.823
Oh no, no, no!
Kill me and run away!

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:33.493
They are everywhere. Kill me immediately!

01:06:33.576 --> 01:06:34.976
Now, now!

01:06:36.329 --> 01:06:39.332
Kill me, please. Do it!

01:06:39.457 --> 01:06:41.751
No, we do not. We do not do that.

01:06:42.627 --> 01:06:45.630
He wants to die.
- I need your help.

01:06:45.964 --> 01:06:49.426
Weapon down.
- If you shoot him, you're dead.

01:07:07.527 --> 01:07:08.927
Mason, everything okay?

01:07:09.404 --> 01:07:10.804
Is Rondeau dead?

01:07:11.364 --> 01:07:13.700
Walk, Mason! You have to get out of there!

01:07:14.451 --> 01:07:18.038
Mason, did you understand me?
Mason, do you hear me?

01:07:18.163 --> 01:07:22.292
Mason, what is it?
Mason! Mason, do you hear me?

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:25.587
What is happening?
Are you in danger? Mason!

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:27.589
They are there.
- Get out there, quickly!

01:07:29.257 --> 01:07:30.657
Right from you!

01:07:34.888 --> 01:07:37.098
No no no no!

01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:47.567
Mason, everything okay?

01:08:32.987 --> 01:08:34.386
Mason, run away!

01:08:54.801 --> 01:08:56.201
He is behind you.

01:08:57.511 --> 01:08:58.912
Run!

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:00.831
Come!

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:03.560
Mason, hurry!

01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:05.085
Run!

01:09:13.486 --> 01:09:14.886
Mason!

01:09:19.868 --> 01:09:21.268
He comes from the left.

01:09:44.017 --> 01:09:45.417
Aurora!

01:10:03.787 --> 01:10:05.187
Go inside!

01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:07.481
Fast!

01:10:19.678 --> 01:10:21.096
Almost, sir.

01:10:24.015 --> 01:10:25.600
You keep well.

01:10:26.768 --> 01:10:28.168
Okay, this can hurt.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:37.779
Breathing. Quiet, deep breathing.

01:10:39.906 --> 01:10:42.409
This is good.
You are very lucky.

01:10:42.992 --> 01:10:45.036
I was responsible for them.

01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:49.833
And now they are dead, by me.

01:10:52.919 --> 01:10:54.838
I never had me
available.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:00.427
I will never lead an expedition again.

01:11:02.303 --> 01:11:03.930
I can not do anything at all.

01:11:06.558 --> 01:11:07.958
I'm sorry, Father.

01:11:08.893 --> 01:11:11.021
Your father made difficult decisions.

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:15.358
You do not know anything about him.

01:11:17.193 --> 01:11:18.593
I know his file.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.699
It was probably an accident.

01:11:23.408 --> 01:11:24.808
An accident...

01:11:26.036 --> 01:11:29.497
An unmanned vehicle ...

01:11:31.458 --> 01:11:33.460
avoided a group of children.

01:11:37.756 --> 01:11:39.507
Only my father was killed.

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:43.636
And I stayed behind ...
- with post-traumatic disturbances.

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:46.830
I'm sorry, sir.

01:11:49.392 --> 01:11:50.792
Compassion?

01:11:52.812 --> 01:11:54.212
From a machine?

01:12:01.613 --> 01:12:03.365
There is no one else.

01:12:06.201 --> 01:12:09.496
It is true, ethics
programming is complicated.

01:12:11.039 --> 01:12:13.500
Technology can be dangerous,
but that's why ...

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:15.627
you should not talk badly.

01:12:17.462 --> 01:12:20.840
Boka, Rondeau, Sato ...

01:12:22.133 --> 01:12:24.094
they are dead by what is out there.

01:12:26.388 --> 01:12:30.892
But you are still there ... and you
can still accomplish this mission.

01:12:33.269 --> 01:12:34.669
You can trust me.

01:12:40.193 --> 01:12:41.593
What are you?

01:12:51.371 --> 01:12:52.771
Flexible.

01:13:16.354 --> 01:13:18.399
GOALS
1) Determine suitability for colonization

01:13:55.185 --> 01:13:57.062
2) Exploring raw material extraction.

01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:17.207
Presence of toxic Nano organisms.

01:14:34.849 --> 01:14:37.352
Both in the water and in nature.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.752
OUTSIDE CAMERA 10
PANORAMA TRANSMISSION

01:15:05.839 --> 01:15:08.133
3) Complete mission.

01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:39.414
Okay, the fourth marker.

01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:42.208
I am now leaving. Everything safe?

01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:44.169
Everything safe. Looks good.

01:15:51.968 --> 01:15:56.556
I would feel safer than you
and your mini weapon down here.

01:15:56.681 --> 01:15:58.850
This is an excellent lookout.

01:15:58.933 --> 01:16:01.144
I have your right in my sights, sir.

01:16:02.479 --> 01:16:04.814
That does not sound reassuring, Aurora.

01:16:04.981 --> 01:16:08.234
Two still, and then we stay
on the basis until NOVA is back.

01:16:09.527 --> 01:16:10.927
I am willing.

01:16:12.489 --> 01:16:14.240
Everything safe. To start.

01:16:20.497 --> 01:16:22.040
Good measurement results will be achieved.

01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:25.627
There is an ocean under the ground.

01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:29.089
It is unfortunately contaminated.

01:16:31.508 --> 01:16:33.051
Gold, a gigantic gold vein.

01:16:35.762 --> 01:16:38.014
The planet may not be habitable ...

01:16:38.139 --> 01:16:40.558
but there are valuable ones
raw materials.

01:16:42.686 --> 01:16:45.772
Sir, no movement.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.840
Can you see?

01:16:49.275 --> 01:16:51.569
Just now. Shoot!

01:16:52.529 --> 01:16:53.929
A moment.

01:16:55.115 --> 01:16:57.867
What are you waiting for, Aurora?
- Soon.

01:16:58.868 --> 01:17:00.268
Shoot!

01:17:02.539 --> 01:17:03.939
What are you doing?

01:17:04.082 --> 01:17:06.584
Do you trust me, no movement.

01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:08.610
Shoot!

01:17:22.642 --> 01:17:25.270
Touch. Out of danger.

01:17:25.854 --> 01:17:28.898
Certainly?
- Yes. You trust me, do not you?

01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:30.650
I have no choice.

01:17:40.452 --> 01:17:41.911
The tablet is broken.

01:17:41.995 --> 01:17:44.289
The last measurements
also succeed without it.

01:17:44.372 --> 01:17:46.958
Or do you want to go straight back to the base?

01:17:50.795 --> 01:17:52.195
Well ...

01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:55.759
now we are already there,
let's fulfill the mission.

01:17:58.136 --> 01:18:00.513
Yes, sir.
- By the way, thanks.

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:03.558
I only do my job, sir.

01:18:06.227 --> 01:18:08.521
What I wanted to say ...

01:18:10.065 --> 01:18:11.465
That was just in time.

01:18:15.862 --> 01:18:18.531
Okay, I'm coming.
- Understood, sir.

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:28.541
Sir!

01:18:28.917 --> 01:18:30.317
Oh shit!

01:18:32.212 --> 01:18:33.612
Aurora!
- Get out of here!

01:21:04.072 --> 01:21:05.740
Mason, I'm here.

01:21:08.118 --> 01:21:10.203
I turn around, okay?

01:21:10.328 --> 01:21:14.249
One two Three.
Okay, slowly and carefully.

01:21:20.755 --> 01:21:27.053
IMPROVE ONLINE SCAN
BANGLONG ALARM

01:21:27.595 --> 01:21:31.891
The right lung is collapsed.
I will take you to the base.

01:21:32.017 --> 01:21:35.562
More first some extra pain,
so you can breathe.

01:21:36.271 --> 01:21:37.671
Do you trust me?

01:21:42.986 --> 01:21:45.030
Try to stay calm.

01:21:50.869 --> 01:21:53.747
One two...

01:21:59.377 --> 01:22:02.297
LONG INFLATION GOING

01:22:09.262 --> 01:22:11.431
Better?
- Yes.

01:22:13.058 --> 01:22:17.479
You must be back within 10 minutes,
otherwise I will do this again. OK?

01:22:17.604 --> 01:22:19.004
Up.

01:22:28.114 --> 01:22:29.514
No...

01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:31.475
You drive.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.871
I give back cover this time.
- Yeah, sir.

01:22:47.384 --> 01:22:48.968
How is it going in there?

01:22:50.261 --> 01:22:51.661
Dangerous.

01:23:41.646 --> 01:23:45.066
Can not this thing be a little faster?
- Something is broken.

01:23:58.747 --> 01:24:01.249
Let's leave it behind.
- Okay.

01:24:36.701 --> 01:24:38.101
How bad is it?

01:24:39.329 --> 01:24:40.729
Very.

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:44.751
They block the entrance.

01:24:59.849 --> 01:25:01.351
Are we walking ...
- Aurora.

01:25:14.823 --> 01:25:16.324
Complete the mission!
- Mason!

01:26:51.252 --> 01:26:52.652
Run!

01:27:03.098 --> 01:27:04.498
Mason!

01:27:05.642 --> 01:27:07.042
Aurora!

01:27:10.230 --> 01:27:11.630
Down!
