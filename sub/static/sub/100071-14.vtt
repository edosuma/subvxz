Now that I, Chinnos,
finally wield the Doomsday App,

00:27.361 --> 00:30.764

in flames,

00:30.831 --> 00:32.099
as a utopia.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.334
I don't know, Chinnos.
You say "utopia,"

00:34.401 --> 00:36.169
but what I'm hearing is
"kill everyone."

00:36.236 --> 00:38.972

a new dry cleaner.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.941

00:41.008 --> 00:43.944

Magnesium Man.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.914
Yeah, but it did distract you,
didn't it, Dad Bod?

00:46.980 --> 00:48.148
Take him, Airshot!

00:48.215 --> 00:51.351

00:51.418 --> 00:53.854
Yes, Airshot, pump that air gun!

00:53.921 --> 00:57.057
Five pumps?

01:01.194 --> 01:03.997
Aw, what's the matter?
Bad head day?

01:44.972 --> 01:47.374
Wow. It was called <i>Crystal War</i>

01:47.441 --> 01:49.576
because they were all
turned to crystals.

01:49.643 --> 01:53.146
Hey, now is not the time
for your cold‐hearted analysis.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.849
The sequel isn't coming out
for a year.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.885
What loving God would make us
wait that long?

01:58.952 --> 02:01.121
A year?
That's, like, a million years.

02:01.188 --> 02:04.291
I cannot wait.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.503
Children, I pulled you
out of your classes today

02:16.570 --> 02:19.072

new Internet trend.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.008
The paprika challenge?

02:21.074 --> 02:23.076

The eight ball challenge?

02:23.143 --> 02:25.979
No, the highly‐imitatable stunt
I'm referring to

02:26.046 --> 02:28.248
is the "flag yourself"

a more effective deterrent

02:35.122 --> 02:36.957

11:44.037 --> 11:46.272
Ugh, it's not my fault.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.907
Bart used his superpower

11:47.974 --> 11:50.944
to get me drunker
than I've ever beer.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.580
(groans) I'm worried that
all this blackmail

11:53.646 --> 11:55.682
is turning Bart
into a bad person.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.750

11:59.085 --> 12:00.053
(zips)

12:00.119 --> 12:01.087
(yawns)

12:01.154 --> 12:03.056
What's the story,
morning glories?

12:03.122 --> 12:06.759
Young man, I don't like the way
you're using those spoilies

12:06.826 --> 12:08.628
to boss people around.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.097
What?

12:11.164 --> 12:12.298
I was given an amazing power,

12:12.365 --> 12:13.900
so I'm using it.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.970
If you were in my suitcase,
you would do the same thing.

12:17.036 --> 12:21.641
Fans have a deep connection to
the Marble Cinematic Universe.

12:21.708 --> 12:25.178
<i>I</i> would <i>never</i> exploit that,
not for anything.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.281
Oh... wouldn't you?

12:33.052 --> 12:34.854
♪ ♪

12:34.921 --> 12:38.024
(American accent): Lisa Simpson,
I think your superpower

12:38.091 --> 12:39.659
must be stealing hearts.

12:39.726 --> 12:42.528
OTHERS:
Aw...

12:42.595 --> 12:45.064
How do you feel
about exploitation now?

12:53.072 --> 12:55.675
How badly do you not want
your bosses at Marble Studios

12:55.742 --> 12:59.212
to know that I used your drunken
thumb to see that movie?

13:02.649 --> 13:04.851
You think I'm your jolly
swagman, do you?

13:04.917 --> 13:06.819
Well, my jumbuck's gonna be free

13:06.886 --> 13:08.788
from your tucker bag
next Thursday,

13:08.855 --> 13:12.358
when that movie goes wide
on every screen in creation.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.862
And after that, you're nothing.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.865
Let's get this party finished!

13:18.931 --> 13:21.367
(dance music playing)

13:21.434 --> 13:23.169
He's right.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.570
I'm running out of time.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.973
This is... endgame!

13:27.040 --> 13:30.476
And so, today, we celebrate
the 200th birthday

13:30.543 --> 13:33.379
of our beloved oak tree,
Old Susie.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.683
Her stately branches
have shaded our town's weddings,

13:36.749 --> 13:41.254
family reunions,
and quincen‐‐ quincien‐‐

13:41.321 --> 13:44.023
uh, Mexican bar mitzvahs.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.425
We're, uh, ow!

13:45.491 --> 13:46.426
(chuckling)

13:46.492 --> 13:49.696
Cover you ears!
It's Spoiler Boy!

13:49.762 --> 13:51.030
That's right. It's me.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.199
And if you don't want
the movie spoiled,

13:53.266 --> 13:55.301
you'll all pull together
and build me

13:55.368 --> 13:58.404
the ultimate tree house
of my own design.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.840
Right here in Old Susie.

14:00.907 --> 14:01.974
(all gasp)

14:02.041 --> 14:04.243
Not in Old Susie!

14:04.310 --> 14:06.679
Everyone in this town
loves that tree!

14:06.746 --> 14:08.881
We have no choice.

14:08.948 --> 14:12.051
He's got us all
by the short and curlies.

14:12.118 --> 14:17.090
Unless the boy should meet
with an unfortunate accident.

14:17.156 --> 14:20.693
Oh. And if anything suspicious
should happen to me,

14:20.760 --> 14:23.963
I've hired the loudest man
in town to yell the ending

14:24.030 --> 14:26.232
on every street corner.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.067
I'm on it!

14:28.134 --> 14:30.803
You have 24 hours
to build my tree house.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.372
The clock is ticking.

14:32.438 --> 14:33.840
(laughs evilly)

14:36.142 --> 14:37.076
(gasps)

14:37.143 --> 14:38.077
(humming)

14:38.144 --> 14:39.645
Hey, buddy.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.880
You're out of the hospital.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.949
Don't you "Hey, buddy" me.

14:43.015 --> 14:45.084
You stole my visit
from Airshot.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.120
You‐‐ you villain!

14:47.186 --> 14:49.922
Me, a villain?
No way.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.758
You just blackmailed
the whole town

14:51.824 --> 14:53.092
to build you a lair.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.361
Okay. I will grant you
the optics on the lair

14:55.428 --> 14:56.929
are less than ideal.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.599
You have actual powers
which you use for evil.

14:59.665 --> 15:02.068
You're a supervillain!

15:02.135 --> 15:05.071
You dare call me a supervillain?

15:05.138 --> 15:06.539
Then get a load of this:

15:06.606 --> 15:09.776
the biggest spoiler
in the whole movie!

15:09.842 --> 15:11.911
BOTH:
Magnesium Man!

15:11.978 --> 15:12.945
Don't say another word!

15:13.012 --> 15:15.548
The fate of our universe
depends on it.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.551
(Bart screams)

15:22.889 --> 15:24.490
(Bart groans)

15:24.557 --> 15:25.625
(yelps)

15:25.691 --> 15:27.326
Where the hell am I?

15:27.393 --> 15:29.162
Relax there, Spoiler Boy.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.597
All we did was take you
from <i>your</i> dimension into <i>ours.</i>

15:31.664 --> 15:33.666
You know, the Marble universe?

15:33.733 --> 15:37.103
What <i>you</i> consider to be movies
make up our reality.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.006
No way. Superheroes aren't real.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.008
How dumb do you think I am?

15:42.074 --> 15:45.144
(gasps)
Actual superpowers!

15:45.211 --> 15:47.346
Everything you see
in your Vindicator movies

15:47.413 --> 15:48.948
actually happens to us.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.851
Even the post‐credit sequences?

15:51.918 --> 15:53.886
‐Mm.
‐We brought you here

15:53.953 --> 15:57.323
to see the result
of your selfish actions.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.927
Whoa! Airshot! Dead?

16:00.993 --> 16:02.428
But in the movie he lives.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.130
Wh‐what happened?

16:04.197 --> 16:05.465
<i>You</i> happened!

16:05.531 --> 16:07.467
You son of a swamp witch!

16:07.533 --> 16:11.804
You showed your Comic Book Guy
a spoiler

16:11.871 --> 16:15.041
of Airshot using his breath
to save himself.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.043
The powers of evil
in our dimension

16:17.109 --> 16:21.280
saw this and, so warned,
taped Airshot's mouth shut.

16:21.347 --> 16:22.482
And killed him.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.051
(whimpers)
I didn't know!

16:25.117 --> 16:27.553
I never dreamed that spoilers
really hurt people.

16:27.620 --> 16:31.691
But they do.
Spoilers kill!

16:31.757 --> 16:34.894
I love you, Airshot! (sobbing)

16:34.961 --> 16:36.929
The virtual reality's working.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.199
The kid has no idea
that this has all been fake.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.068
I can't believe he didn't notice

16:42.134 --> 16:44.036
that the dimensional portal
in his backyard

16:44.103 --> 16:47.373
was just a garbage bag
full of glow sticks.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.242
Tell me we're doing
the right thing.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.277
Tell me this is
Bart's best chance

16:51.344 --> 16:53.112
to choose to be a good person.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.881
Don't worry, Marge.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.884
No one's ever been hurt
by a little gaslighting.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.219
Remember how
you always say that?

17:00.286 --> 17:02.021
Remember?

17:02.088 --> 17:03.155
Mm‐hmm.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.991
Oh, don't think of it
as gaslighting.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.993
Think of it as
an ultra‐enhanced,

17:07.059 --> 17:08.728
immersive fan experience.

17:08.794 --> 17:12.098
All this, just to keep
spoilers from leaking.

17:12.164 --> 17:15.334
<i>Vindicators, colon,</i>
<i>Crystal War, colon, Resurgence</i>

17:15.401 --> 17:16.769
bombing at the box office

17:16.836 --> 17:18.905
would have devastating
consequences.

17:18.971 --> 17:22.041
Failing theme parks,
unsold Halloween costumes

17:22.108 --> 17:23.175
rotting on the docks,

17:23.242 --> 17:25.545
mass suicides
by popcorn farmers;

17:25.611 --> 17:28.681
anything worse than a 55% hold

17:28.748 --> 17:30.182
on its second weekend,

17:30.249 --> 17:33.419
the global economy
collapses like a house of cards.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.922
Is that what you want,
little girl? Is it?

17:35.988 --> 17:37.456
(quietly):
No. No.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.392
Bart clearly feels bad.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.160
Can't we let him out now?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.996
No. We have to be
absolutely sure.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.799
Increasing simulation intensity.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.672
Bring me the boy.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.973
(warriors snarling)

17:56.809 --> 17:58.010
Ahh!

17:58.077 --> 18:00.079
Remember, kid, no spoilers!

18:00.146 --> 18:01.681
Our universe depends on it!

18:01.747 --> 18:05.585
And don't pirate movies.
That hurts everyone.

18:08.154 --> 18:10.923
So, the boy who's seen
how all this ends.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.425
Tell me what you know,

18:12.491 --> 18:14.994
so I can use it
to destroy the Vindicators.

18:15.061 --> 18:18.164
In return, I will grant
your deepest desire:

18:18.230 --> 18:20.933
actual superpowers.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.902
BART:
Muscles...

18:22.969 --> 18:24.303
claws...

18:24.370 --> 18:25.738
bike!

18:25.805 --> 18:27.073
Real powers.

18:27.139 --> 18:29.842
That's even better
than spoiler powers.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.744
(chuckling)

18:31.811 --> 18:34.413
Oh, no. Our son is going
to choose evil.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.951
Oh, no! Our son is so stupid
he's going to fall for this!

18:39.018 --> 18:41.053
It doesn't matter
that's it not real.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.389
Bart's soul is at stake.

18:43.456 --> 18:47.793
Great emotion.
Talk about upping the ante.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.695
Tell me the spoilers, child.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.398
And embrace your destiny
as a villain.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.666
Hmm.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.067
Airshot.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.869
All right.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.471
I'll tell you
what you have to do to win.

18:58.537 --> 18:59.672
‐No!
‐Uh‐uh, kid.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.874
Eat my shorts.

19:03.342 --> 19:04.910
(grunts)

19:05.911 --> 19:07.146
No. No.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.215
‐No...!
‐(screams)

19:16.255 --> 19:19.725
Our son's a good guy!
A good guy.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.729
But he's still stupid.
So stupid...

19:23.796 --> 19:25.898
The kid turned down
actual superpowers.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.234
I think he'll
keep his mouth shut.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.136
Okay. We'll let him live.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.704
‐(humming triumphantly)
‐For now.

19:34.707 --> 19:35.875
(groans)

19:35.941 --> 19:37.510
Uh‐‐ I'm back.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.079
I just hope it's not too late.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.681
What day is it?

19:41.747 --> 19:45.051
Why, it's the Wednesday
before Memorial Day, it is.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.085
Then there's still time.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.887
The movie hasn't been spoiled.

19:47.953 --> 19:48.954
Don't worry, son.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.357
Your secret I forgot
is safe with me.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.694
I saved their universe.
I'm not a villain.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.563
I'm a superhero.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.766
‐When can we tell him?
‐Never.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.268
All right.
No one's gonna talk.

20:02.334 --> 20:03.269
The movie's safe.

20:03.335 --> 20:06.739
We'll let them live.
For now.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.808
(minor key "When You Wish
Upon a Star" plays)

20:23.137 --> 20:25.491
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm a good guy.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.961
I'll never spoil anything again.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.697
I'm a changed boy.
A changed boy.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.133
I always knew you had
the stuff of heroes.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.302
Just tell me, does Moby Man
take his place

20:36.368 --> 20:39.705
as the rightful sovereign
of Fishtonia?

20:39.772 --> 20:42.141
Does he? Bart!
Tell me!

20:42.208 --> 20:43.976
Stop your labors, good folk.

20:44.043 --> 20:48.047

every one.

<i>And Bart was as good</i>
