13:36.106 --> 13:38.317
<i>It's pretty rocky, but yeah.</i>

13:39.860 --> 13:45.074
<i>Uh, we, uh, we can't...
we can't just leave.</i>

13:46.075 --> 13:48.452
<i>We've got
two days of water, tops.</i>

13:49.662 --> 13:50.996
<i>And then what?
Just sit around and die?</i>

13:51.038 --> 13:52.540
<i>What if the rescue team comes?</i>

13:52.581 --> 13:55.543
<i>Do you think they're taking
their time on purpose?</i>

13:58.546 --> 14:02.675
<i>If they knew where we were,
they would be here already.</i>

14:03.634 --> 14:05.302
<i>You don't know that.</i>

14:07.763 --> 14:10.057
<i>What do you think, Coach?</i>

14:10.099 --> 14:11.767
<i>I don't, I don't know.</i>

14:11.809 --> 14:14.979
<i>Uh, I mean,
you'd have to leave me behind,</i>

14:15.020 --> 14:16.355
<i>I guess, but whatever.</i>

14:16.397 --> 14:17.523
<i>We could make you a stretcher.</i>

14:17.565 --> 14:18.858
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

14:18.899 --> 14:20.359
<i>Seriously. If we take turns
carrying it...</i>

14:20.401 --> 14:21.694
<i>N-No.</i>

14:21.735 --> 14:22.945
<i>This-this is bullshit.</i>

14:22.987 --> 14:24.613
<i>I say no. Okay?</i>

14:24.655 --> 14:26.699
<i>No way.</i>

14:26.740 --> 14:29.285
<i>Let's put it to a vote.</i>

14:30.411 --> 14:32.288
<i>All in favor of waiting here?</i>

14:32.329 --> 14:34.623
<i>gentle music</i>

14:36.083 --> 14:38.460
<i>vocalizing</i>

14:45.092 --> 14:47.303
<i>All in favor of the lake?</i>

15:01.692 --> 15:04.528
<i>Then it's settled.
Grab your shit.</i>

15:04.570 --> 15:08.073
<i>rhythmic breathing
and dramatic music</i>

16:01.126 --> 16:02.795
<i>You want some?</i>

16:02.836 --> 16:04.213
<i>Your backwash?</i>

16:04.254 --> 16:06.090
<i>I'll pass.</i>

16:06.131 --> 16:08.217
<i>Hey.</i>

16:08.258 --> 16:10.052
<i>Thanks for having my back
during the vote.</i>

16:10.094 --> 16:13.347
<i>I didn't have your back.
It was just what I thought.</i>

16:13.389 --> 16:16.266
<i>Well, either way,
it was the right call.</i>

16:16.308 --> 16:18.394
<i>You don't know that.</i>

16:18.435 --> 16:20.104
<i>I mean, we think
we know what we're doing,</i>

16:20.145 --> 16:22.356
<i>but really we have no clue.</i>

16:24.692 --> 16:27.319
<i>"Cambodia" by Kim Wilde</i>

16:27.361 --> 16:31.657
<i>Well, he was Thailand-based,
she was an Air Force wife</i>

16:31.699 --> 16:36.078
<i>He used to fly weekends,
it was the easy life</i>

16:36.120 --> 16:40.332
<i>But then it turned around
and he began to change</i>

16:40.374 --> 16:42.751
<i>She didn't wonder then</i>

16:42.793 --> 16:45.254
<i>She didn't think
it's strange</i>

16:45.295 --> 16:48.841
<i>But then he got a call,
he had to leave that night</i>

16:48.882 --> 16:52.970
<i>He couldn't say too much,
but it would be all right</i>

16:53.012 --> 16:55.097
<i>- He didn't need to pack</i>
<i></i>

16:55.139 --> 16:58.100
<i>- They'd meet the next night</i>

16:58.142 --> 17:00.686
<i>He had a job to do</i>

17:00.728 --> 17:05.774
<i>Flying to Cambodia</i>

17:05.816 --> 17:08.193
<i>vocalizing</i>

17:21.915 --> 17:23.250
<i>Shit.</i>

17:23.292 --> 17:25.753
<i>And as the nights passed by</i>

17:25.794 --> 17:27.880
<i>She tried to trace the past</i>

17:27.921 --> 17:32.801
<i>The way he used to look,
the way he used to laugh</i>

17:32.843 --> 17:36.180
<i>I guess she'll never know
what got inside his soul</i>

17:36.221 --> 17:38.724
<i>- She couldn't make it out</i>

17:38.766 --> 17:40.893
<i>Just couldn't take it all</i>

17:40.934 --> 17:43.020
<i>- He had the saddest eyes</i>

17:43.062 --> 17:45.314
<i>- The girl had ever seen</i>

17:45.355 --> 17:48.859
<i>He used to cry some nights
as though he lived a dream</i>

17:48.901 --> 17:50.569
<i>Shit. Sorry. Sorry.</i>

17:50.611 --> 17:54.156
<i>And as she held him close,
he used to search her face</i>

17:54.198 --> 17:57.034
<i>As though she knew the truth</i>

17:57.076 --> 18:01.830
<i>Lost inside Cambodia</i>

<i>vocalizing</i>

<i>But there is
only one thing left</i>

18:15.010 --> 18:18.597
<i>I know for sure</i>

18:18.639 --> 18:23.519
<i>She won't see his face again</i>

<i>What's that smell?</i>

18:32.861 --> 18:34.029
<i>I don't know.</i>

18:34.071 --> 18:35.989
<i>Holy shit.</i>

18:40.327 --> 18:42.371
<i>Oh, God, I'm gonna puke.</i>

18:42.412 --> 18:44.206
<i>Whoa. Sick.</i>

18:44.248 --> 18:46.792
<i>What could've done that?</i>

18:48.168 --> 18:49.795
<i>A wolf, probably.</i>

18:49.837 --> 18:51.880
<i>-They can kill a fucking bear?
- Yeah.</i>

18:51.922 --> 18:54.800
<i>Wolves can kill anything
if the pack's big enough.</i>

19:00.264 --> 19:02.307

19:03.517 --> 19:05.477
<i></i>

19:05.519 --> 19:07.312
<i>-It's about time.
Sorry.</i>

19:07.354 --> 19:08.522
<i>Been busy.</i>

19:08.564 --> 19:09.982
<i>Yeah, busy cashing my checks.</i>

19:10.023 --> 19:12.693
<i>Hey, this hasn't been easy.</i>

19:12.734 --> 19:15.654
<i>Some of you guys just love
living off the grid.</i>

19:18.115 --> 19:20.033
<i>But so far, nobody's talked.</i>

19:20.075 --> 19:21.243
<i>How hard are you pushing?</i>

19:21.285 --> 19:24.663
<i>Money, book deals.</i>

19:24.705 --> 19:27.583
<i>If you want me busting kneecaps,
it's gonna cost extra.</i>

19:27.624 --> 19:29.501
<i>Just hurry up and try the rest.</i>

19:29.543 --> 19:32.212
<i>Phil's ad is tanking my numbers.</i>

<i>If there's an October surprise
coming, I'm fucked.</i>

19:34.548 --> 19:36.842
<i>So you want to hit back?</i>

19:36.884 --> 19:38.343
<i>Meaning?</i>

19:38.385 --> 19:40.220
<i>Bathurst's daughter is a junkie.</i>

19:40.262 --> 19:42.139
<i>You got proof?</i>

19:42.181 --> 19:44.308
<i>Three rehab stints
before the age of 16.</i>

19:45.434 --> 19:48.854
<i>Last year, he buried an arrest
for heroin possession</i>

19:48.896 --> 19:50.689
<i>so she wouldn't get expelled
from Blair.</i>

19:50.731 --> 19:52.524
<i>How old is she now?</i>

19:52.566 --> 19:54.818
<i>Eighteen. Fair game.</i>

19:56.403 --> 19:58.697
<i>Oh, shit. I got to go.</i>

20:01.033 --> 20:03.368
<i>What happened?</i>

20:06.580 --> 20:08.707
<i>-Sammy, did you do this?
- Yes.</i>

20:08.749 --> 20:10.209
<i>Honey, are you okay?</i>

20:10.250 --> 20:11.793
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

20:11.835 --> 20:13.212
<i>I guess they were playing rough,</i>

20:13.253 --> 20:15.756
<i>and my son's elbow
whacked him in the face.</i>

<i>Yeah, let's go.</i>

21:06.807 --> 21:08.934
<i>rhythmic breathing
and dramatic music</i>

21:12.562 --> 21:13.855
<i>It wasn't that big a deal.</i>

21:13.897 --> 21:15.274
<i>Sammy punched him in the face.</i>

21:15.315 --> 21:17.276
<i>Yeah, well,
hearing his mom called names</i>

21:17.317 --> 21:19.236
<i>brings it out in him, I guess.</i>

21:19.278 --> 21:23.532
<i>Luckily, he thought the boy
was saying I was a "cannonball."</i>

21:23.573 --> 21:25.784
<i>-He probably heard his parents</i>

21:25.826 --> 21:27.244
<i>talking about Bathurst's ad.</i>

21:27.286 --> 21:29.454
<i>God, Monni.</i>

21:29.496 --> 21:32.916
<i>This could be our new normal
if I don't hit back.</i>

21:34.501 --> 21:35.836
<i>What?</i>

21:35.877 --> 21:37.921
<i>Our son just assaulted
another child,</i>

21:37.963 --> 21:40.590
<i>and you're talking strategy?</i>

21:41.341 --> 21:42.592
<i>You're right.</i>

21:43.635 --> 21:45.679
<i>-Okay.</i>

21:50.183 --> 21:52.978
<i>Baby, we need to talk about
why you hit that boy today.</i>

21:53.020 --> 21:54.980
<i>No.</i>

21:55.022 --> 21:56.606
<i>Yes.</i>

21:56.648 --> 21:58.817
<i>You don't hit people,
no matter what they say to you.</i>

21:58.859 --> 21:59.818
<i>Be quiet.</i>

21:59.860 --> 22:02.070
<i>What did you just say?</i>

22:04.531 --> 22:06.241
<i>Okay, that's it.</i>

22:09.202 --> 22:10.829
<i>Give him back.</i>

22:11.705 --> 22:14.708
<i>ominous music</i>

22:16.209 --> 22:20.005
<i>Give... him... back.</i>

22:26.386 --> 22:28.847
<i>Go to your room, Sammy.</i>

22:29.973 --> 22:31.683
<i>Go!</i>

22:47.240 --> 22:51.578
This shit is
way longer than four miles.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.497
<i>What if we missed it?</i>

22:54.289 --> 22:58.085
<i>From the angle of the sun, it
looked just left of due north.</i>

22:58.126 --> 22:59.378
<i>Oh, great.</i>

22:59.419 --> 23:01.546
<i>"Left." That's a precise way
of doing it.</i>

23:01.588 --> 23:03.507
<i>I'm not a fucking cartographer.</i>

23:03.548 --> 23:06.051
<i>Or maybe you saw a mirage.</i>

23:07.052 --> 23:08.470
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

23:08.512 --> 23:10.555
<i>Oh, hell yeah, bitches!</i>

23:11.932 --> 23:14.893
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>
Yeah!

23:38.625 --> 23:39.876
<i>Guys, come in!</i>

23:39.918 --> 23:41.628
<i>It feels fucking great!</i>

23:43.463 --> 23:45.048
<i>Fuck, it's freezing! Oh, my God.</i>

23:46.967 --> 23:50.762
<i>And, oh, my dreams</i>

this before</i>

<i>Asshole!</i>

24:03.191 --> 24:08.155
<i>But now I'm feeling it
even more</i>

24:08.196 --> 24:10.532
<i>Because it came from you...</i>

24:10.574 --> 24:12.576
<i>Is Travis actually</i>

24:12.617 --> 24:14.202
<i>hot?</i>

24:15.495 --> 24:17.372
<i>A totally amazing mind...</i>

24:17.414 --> 24:18.915
<i>It's been three days.</i>

24:18.957 --> 24:20.792
<i>You guys can't be
that desperate.</i>

24:20.834 --> 24:23.128
<i>And so kind</i>

24:23.170 --> 24:26.131
<i>You're everything to me</i>

24:44.316 --> 24:46.359
<i>You should've brought
your rifle.</i>

24:47.486 --> 24:51.323
<i>What? We haven't seen Travis
in like 25 years.</i>

24:51.364 --> 24:53.825
<i>He moved out to the sticks,
he changed his name.</i>

24:56.369 --> 24:59.372
<i>It's got Unabomber
written all over it.</i>

25:13.303 --> 25:15.013
<i>I don't see a car.</i>

25:15.055 --> 25:16.890
<i>We could go back into town,
check it out,</i>

25:16.932 --> 25:19.351
<i>get some wings, come back later.</i>

25:21.728 --> 25:23.855

<i>Are you sure
this is a good idea?</i>

25:26.233 --> 25:29.945

the, uh, neighbors see?</i>

25:40.372 --> 25:41.873
<i>Yikes.</i>

25:41.915 --> 25:44.876
<i>Someone could use a trip
to Tuesday Morning.</i>

25:47.212 --> 25:49.047
<i>You know, it's never a good sign</i>

25:49.089 --> 25:51.299
<i>when a suspect
lives like a hermit.</i>

25:51.341 --> 25:54.386

all the time.</i>

25:54.427 --> 25:56.012
<i>Aren't you a nurse?</i>

25:56.054 --> 25:58.223
<i>It is common knowledge that</i>

Mike McGreevy,</i>

26:04.729 --> 26:07.232
<i>aka the Gibbsboro Ghoul.</i>

26:07.274 --> 26:10.652
<i>He owned barely anything.</i>

26:10.694 --> 26:13.863
<i>Turns out he was robbing graves</i>

26:13.905 --> 26:16.950
<i>because he was
collecting teeth to make...</i>

26:16.992 --> 26:19.119
<i>Hey, can you look in the trash?</i>

26:19.160 --> 26:21.329
<i>-I saw a can back there.
- Oh, that's a really good idea.</i>

26:21.371 --> 26:23.206
<i>You know, you can learn
so much about a person</i>

26:23.248 --> 26:25.792
<i>by going through
their personal refuse.</i>

<i>Hi.</i>

27:47.040 --> 27:48.667
<i>Thought I'd bring
the lake to you.</i>

27:48.708 --> 27:51.336
<i>Here, take your shirt off.
I'll squirt you.</i>

27:52.045 --> 27:54.881
<i>Yeah. I'm not gonna do that.</i>

27:59.177 --> 28:01.346
<i>If that girl poured water
on my hair,</i>

28:01.388 --> 28:03.890

28:18.613 --> 28:20.740
<i>Well, you're not
that much of a bitch.</i>

28:20.782 --> 28:24.035
Okay.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.122
<i>Once we get back, we can, like,
move our lockers together.</i>

28:27.163 --> 28:28.957
<i>I think that would be,
like, so much fun.</i>

28:28.998 --> 28:30.250
<i>Now that we found the lake</i>

28:30.291 --> 28:31.543
<i>and, like, now
that we've been bonding,</i>

28:31.584 --> 28:32.836
<i>I think it just totally
makes sense.</i>

28:32.877 --> 28:34.546
<i>Right?
- Right?</i>

28:34.587 --> 28:36.339
<i>Yeah. That's what I thought.</i>

28:36.381 --> 28:40.301
<i></i>

28:40.343 --> 28:42.345
<i>Travis definitely hasn't been
getting his veggies.</i>

28:42.387 --> 28:43.638
<i>What's that?</i>

28:43.680 --> 28:45.014
<i>It's his pay stub.</i>

28:45.056 --> 28:46.182
<i>Looks like he's been
working at a place</i>

28:46.224 --> 28:48.435
<i>called Willow Brook Ranch.</i>

28:49.185 --> 28:51.062
<i>That's a $200 bottle.</i>

28:51.104 --> 28:52.480
That's expensive taste

29:07.704 --> 29:08.997

29:09.914 --> 29:11.583
<i>What are you doing in here?</i>

an old friend.</i>

<i>Such an old friend
you had to bust his window?</i>

29:17.130 --> 29:18.506
<i>On your knees.</i>

29:18.548 --> 29:20.049
<i>Now.</i>

29:23.845 --> 29:26.139
<i>Lady, I will shoot you.</i>

29:28.475 --> 29:30.059
<i>Like that?</i>

29:31.311 --> 29:33.438
<i>I'm sorry, I'm not allowed
to give out room information</i>

29:33.480 --> 29:36.483
<i>if your name is not
on the reservation.</i>

29:36.524 --> 29:38.026
<i>Um, I'm his wife.</i>

29:38.067 --> 29:40.612
<i>He just hasn't texted me
the room number yet.</i>

29:40.653 --> 29:41.905
<i>So, just...</i>

29:41.946 --> 29:43.281
<i>Then I'm sure he will soon.</i>

29:44.783 --> 29:48.119
<i>Look, I didn't want
to have to do this,</i>

29:48.161 --> 29:49.871
<i>but I'm with Homeland Security.</i>

29:49.913 --> 29:53.458
<i>We're undercover, but
we just tracked our guy here,</i>

29:53.500 --> 29:56.127
<i>and now all we need is the room.</i>

29:56.169 --> 29:59.130
<i>I-I have my badge in my pocket,</i>

29:59.172 --> 30:01.216
<i>but this motherfucker
has eyes everywhere.</i>

30:01.257 --> 30:04.302
<i>If I show it to you,
I might get made.</i>

30:05.011 --> 30:06.971
<i>Excuse me.</i>

30:07.013 --> 30:08.973
<i>Agent Smith?</i>

30:09.808 --> 30:12.018
<i>D.C.'s on the line. Briefing.</i>

30:12.977 --> 30:14.479
<i>-That's important. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

30:14.521 --> 30:15.897
<i>Uh, thank you.</i>

30:17.774 --> 30:20.151
<i>-Oh, my God.</i>

30:25.073 --> 30:26.866
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

30:26.908 --> 30:28.660
<i>Well, I was just about
to ask you the same thing,</i>

30:28.701 --> 30:32.038
<i>but apparently the answer
is anti-terrorism.</i>

30:34.541 --> 30:35.625
<i>Yes. I...</i>

30:35.667 --> 30:37.210
<i>Like to mess with people.
I'm aware.</i>

30:39.212 --> 30:41.714
<i>Well, I didn't come here
to fight crime.</i>

30:41.756 --> 30:43.675
<i>I came here for a drink.</i>

30:43.716 --> 30:45.385
<i>My studio space
is down the street,</i>

30:45.426 --> 30:48.179
<i>and this place
does a classic martini.</i>

30:48.221 --> 30:50.473
<i>Kind of looks like
you could use one.</i>

30:53.893 --> 30:57.939
<i>You know, if a bomb goes off,
that's on you.</i>

30:57.981 --> 30:59.566
<i>I will take full responsibility.</i>

30:59.607 --> 31:01.359
<i>Okay.</i>

31:03.736 --> 31:04.863
<i>The old slammer.</i>

31:04.904 --> 31:06.489
Wow.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.950
<i>It certainly smells
the way I thought it would.</i>

31:11.202 --> 31:13.621
<i>I bet he thinks we're hookers.</i>

31:15.415 --> 31:18.543
<i>You stole
my battery cable, Misty.</i>

31:18.585 --> 31:20.545
<i>Why would you fucking do that?</i>

31:20.587 --> 31:23.631
<i>Well, I wanted to come with you,
and I didn't think you'd let me.</i>

31:24.757 --> 31:26.092
<i>Was I wrong?</i>

31:27.594 --> 31:28.678
<i>Phone calls.</i>

31:28.720 --> 31:31.139
<i>Scatorccio first.</i>

31:32.807 --> 31:34.684
<i>It's Scatorccio.</i>

31:55.496 --> 31:56.873
<i>Hello?</i>

31:56.915 --> 31:58.041
<i>You have received a collect call</i>

31:58.082 --> 31:59.459
<i>from Eden Falls Police Station.</i>

31:59.500 --> 32:01.085
<i>-The caller's name is...
-[Natalie]</i> <i>Natalie.</i>

32:01.127 --> 32:02.837
<i>Will you accept the charges?</i>

32:02.879 --> 32:04.756
<i>-Yes.</i>

32:04.797 --> 32:07.383
<i>Three days out of rehab,
and you're already arrested.</i>

32:07.425 --> 32:09.093
<i>Was there some record
to beat or--</i>

32:09.135 --> 32:10.929
<i>I missed my three hots</i>

32:10.970 --> 32:12.722
<i>-and a cot.</i>

32:12.764 --> 32:15.600
<i>I guess you can be funny
when it's not your money wasted.</i>

32:15.642 --> 32:18.519
<i>I never asked you
to pay for rehab.</i>

32:18.561 --> 32:21.272
<i>And I'm not high, if it matters.</i>

32:21.314 --> 32:23.608
<i>Where is Eden Falls?</i>

32:23.650 --> 32:24.901
<i>New Hampshire.</i>

32:24.943 --> 32:26.194
<i>What the hell is up there?</i>

32:26.235 --> 32:28.112
<i>Travis.</i>

32:28.154 --> 32:30.114
<i>For fuck's sake, Natalie.</i>

32:30.156 --> 32:34.744
<i>I got a lead that he was,
uh, living up here, and then,</i>

32:34.786 --> 32:37.830
<i>you know, the cops found me
looking around his place.</i>

32:37.872 --> 32:39.332
<i>Meaning you broke in.</i>

32:39.374 --> 32:40.792
<i>Have you seen him yet?</i>

32:40.833 --> 32:44.837
<i>No, but I think
I know where he works.</i>

32:44.879 --> 32:45.964
<i>Go home, Nat.</i>

32:46.005 --> 32:47.757
<i>Home?</i>

32:47.799 --> 32:49.175
<i>Yeah, what's that?</i>

32:49.217 --> 32:50.593
<i>He doesn't want to be found.</i>

32:50.635 --> 32:52.679
<i>He disappeared on you
for a reason.</i>

32:52.720 --> 32:53.805
<i>Wow.</i>

32:53.846 --> 32:56.474
<i>Thanks for your support.</i>

32:56.516 --> 32:58.518
<i>I just know how this story goes,
and so do you.</i>

32:58.559 --> 33:01.312
<i>You two are the worst
for each other,</i>

33:01.354 --> 33:03.606
<i>and I don't want to pull you
out of that toxic shit again.</i>

33:03.648 --> 33:06.484
<i>It's so easy for you
to judge others</i>

33:06.526 --> 33:08.486
<i>with your perfect life, right?</i>

33:08.528 --> 33:10.655
<i>-I'm hanging up.
- No.</i>

33:10.697 --> 33:12.323
<i>Come on.</i>

33:12.365 --> 33:15.576
<i>I need you to bail me
out of this place.</i>

33:15.618 --> 33:17.495
<i>You could make a call
or something.</i>

33:17.537 --> 33:19.330
<i>You know people, right?</i>

33:19.372 --> 33:21.833
<i>Oh, you're kidding me, right?</i>

33:21.874 --> 33:23.960
<i>What's the point
in having all your connections</i>

33:24.002 --> 33:25.670
<i>if you can't use them?</i>

33:25.712 --> 33:27.422
<i>If I pull strings
to get you out of jail,</i>

33:27.463 --> 33:28.756
<i>how do you think
that's gonna look?</i>

33:28.798 --> 33:30.675
<i>I don't know.</i>

33:30.717 --> 33:32.885
<i>I'm sorry, I can't help you.</i>

33:33.886 --> 33:36.431
<i>I need to find him, Tai.</i>

33:37.306 --> 33:38.307
<i>Please.</i>

33:38.349 --> 33:39.934
<i>Not this time.</i>

33:46.733 --> 33:49.694
<i></i>

33:49.736 --> 33:52.321
<i>contemplative music</i>

33:58.745 --> 34:01.039
<i></i>

34:01.080 --> 34:03.291
<i>-Yes!</i>

34:03.332 --> 34:05.710
<i>vocalizing</i>

34:10.798 --> 34:11.924
<i>Guys!</i>

34:13.051 --> 34:14.385
<i>Look.</i>

34:19.891 --> 34:21.559
<i>-What is that?
- It looks like a reflection.</i>

34:21.601 --> 34:24.729
<i>Guys, there's something
on the hill!</i>

34:24.771 --> 34:26.856
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

34:26.898 --> 34:28.399
<i>Let's check it out.</i>

34:28.441 --> 34:29.984
<i>Come on, you guys.</i>

34:30.026 --> 34:31.736
<i>There's something.
Come on, let's go.</i>

34:31.778 --> 34:34.781
<i>rhythmic breathing
and gentle music</i>

34:44.457 --> 34:46.667
<i>-Guys, it's here. It's here!</i>

34:49.921 --> 34:50.922
<i>I don't see anybody.</i>

34:50.963 --> 34:52.090
<i>-Hello? Hello?</i>

34:52.131 --> 34:53.132
<i>Is anybody in there?!</i>

34:53.174 --> 34:54.300
<i>-Hello!
- Hello?</i>

34:54.342 --> 34:57.470
<i>Hello! Anybody home?!</i>

35:00.306 --> 35:02.475
<i>ominous music</i>

35:10.149 --> 35:12.985
<i>Hello? Is anyone here?</i>

35:15.404 --> 35:18.616
<i>Maybe they just went on a hike?</i>

35:18.658 --> 35:20.743
<i>Yeah, like a decade ago.</i>

35:24.080 --> 35:25.623
<i>It reeks in here.</i>

35:30.962 --> 35:32.171
<i>Jesus.</i>

35:32.713 --> 35:36.968
<i>You guys, check the pantry,
see if there's any food.</i>

35:37.009 --> 35:39.804
<i>Everyone else, look around
for stuff we can use.</i>

35:39.846 --> 35:43.057
<i>First aid, flashlights, tools.</i>

35:52.358 --> 35:54.986
<i>-Food. Oh, yeah.</i>

35:56.362 --> 35:59.991
<i>What the hell? Jackie,
that's not your personal buffet.</i>

36:00.032 --> 36:01.826
<i>Ugh. Fuck.</i>

36:01.868 --> 36:04.036
<i>-Gross.</i>

36:04.078 --> 36:06.539
<i>See, this is why we should've
stayed in the plane!</i>

36:07.498 --> 36:09.041
<i>Yeah, well, we didn't.</i>

36:10.626 --> 36:12.128
<i>So this is helping how exactly?</i>

36:12.170 --> 36:14.839
<i>This is a fucking nightmare.</i>

36:15.506 --> 36:17.133
<i>somber music</i>

36:21.095 --> 36:22.597
<i>Fuck.</i>

36:27.059 --> 36:29.437
<i>vocalizing</i>

36:52.835 --> 36:54.337
<i>Well, hello.</i>

36:54.378 --> 36:56.005
<i>Don't worry, guys.</i>

36:56.047 --> 36:57.632
<i>We might be stuck in the middle
of nowhere, but, hey,</i>

36:57.673 --> 36:59.550
<i>at least there's porn.</i>

36:59.592 --> 37:01.093
<i>Holy shit.
- I'm not kidding.</i>

37:01.135 --> 37:02.303
<i>-Look.
- Gnarly.</i>

37:02.345 --> 37:03.763
<i>Whoa.</i>

37:03.804 --> 37:04.680
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

37:04.722 --> 37:07.058
<i>-Whoa.</i>

37:07.558 --> 37:10.228
<i>Hey, this guy kind of
looks like you, Flex.</i>

37:10.269 --> 37:12.188
<i>If only any of you
actually looked like her.</i>

37:12.230 --> 37:13.940
<i>Okay. Yeah. Very funny.</i>

37:13.981 --> 37:17.443
<i>Do guys, like, actually
jerk off to this stuff?</i>

37:18.527 --> 37:20.196
<i>Nah, we-we hate that shit.</i>

37:20.238 --> 37:22.740
<i>You know, you can't even tell
what her favorite book is.</i>

37:22.782 --> 37:26.160
<i>-Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Ha-ha.</i>

37:28.454 --> 37:30.248
<i>-Oh, my God.
- Like, what is that?</i>

37:30.289 --> 37:31.540
<i>I don't know, dude.</i>

37:42.134 --> 37:43.094
<i>Hey. Let me see it.</i>

37:43.135 --> 37:44.428
<i>No.</i>

37:44.470 --> 37:46.597
<i>Come on, let me see it.</i>

37:52.144 --> 37:53.854
<i>Spit it out.</i>

37:54.981 --> 37:56.941
<i>No.</i>

37:56.983 --> 37:59.402
<i>Spit it out.</i>

38:01.153 --> 38:03.239
<i>Let go!</i>

38:03.281 --> 38:06.242
<i>-Let go!</i>

38:06.284 --> 38:08.536
<i>Dad was a dick, Javi.</i>

38:08.577 --> 38:09.996
<i>All right?</i>

38:10.037 --> 38:11.289
<i>He's the whole reason
we're in this hell,</i>

38:11.330 --> 38:12.999
<i>-and now he's dead.</i>

38:13.040 --> 38:14.583
<i>-Don't you understand?</i>

38:14.625 --> 38:16.502
<i>Dad is fucking dead!</i>

38:16.544 --> 38:19.505
<i>somber music</i>

38:27.388 --> 38:29.765
<i>dramatic music</i>

38:33.602 --> 38:36.147
<i>vocalizing</i>

38:41.277 --> 38:43.321
<i>Who'd you call?</i>

38:43.362 --> 38:46.407
<i>Someone I thought was a friend,
but I guess I was wrong.</i>

38:46.449 --> 38:47.867
<i>So it's my turn?</i>

38:49.702 --> 38:51.162
<i>Who do you have to call?</i>

38:51.203 --> 38:52.288
<i>Your bird?</i>

38:52.330 --> 38:54.165
<i>Oh.</i>

38:54.206 --> 38:56.542
<i>Caligula hasn't learned
how to use the phone yet.</i>

39:02.214 --> 39:04.842
<i>I mean, it looked like it was
frayed down to a single wire,</i>

39:04.884 --> 39:07.762
<i>but actually
it was aircraft cable.</i>

39:07.803 --> 39:09.138
<i>It could hold 4,000 pounds.</i>

39:09.180 --> 39:11.724
<i>But turns out
the NYPD wasn't so thrilled</i>

39:11.766 --> 39:13.267
<i>about having a giant bank safe</i>

39:13.309 --> 39:16.062
<i>dangling above
the streets of Chelsea.</i>

39:16.103 --> 39:19.857
<i>After that debacle, I pretty
much had to swallow my pride,</i>

39:19.899 --> 39:21.650
<i>move back across the river.</i>

39:21.692 --> 39:23.819
<i>I was flat broke,</i>

39:23.861 --> 39:27.531
<i>but it made me
connect to my roots again.</i>

39:27.573 --> 39:29.533
<i>Figurative stuff mostly.</i>

39:29.575 --> 39:32.244
<i>I don't know, there's...</i>

39:32.286 --> 39:34.038
<i>something freeing about it.</i>

39:34.080 --> 39:35.831
<i>I go where the work takes me.</i>

39:35.873 --> 39:38.751
<i>I don't ask why or where.</i>

39:40.086 --> 39:41.545
<i>I can just let go.</i>

39:49.929 --> 39:51.138
<i>You okay?</i>

39:51.180 --> 39:52.765
<i>Yeah, I'm fine. Mm.</i>

39:54.934 --> 39:58.187
<i>"We are what we pretend to be,</i>

39:58.229 --> 40:01.148
<i>so we must be careful
what we pretend to be."</i>

40:03.234 --> 40:07.154
<i>"And I asked myself</i>

40:07.196 --> 40:10.908
<i>how wide it was,
how deep it was,</i>

40:10.950 --> 40:13.077
<i>how much was mine to keep."</i>

40:14.703 --> 40:16.414
<i>Think I like this book club.</i>

40:20.418 --> 40:22.336
<i>Why are you here, Shauna?</i>

40:23.921 --> 40:28.092
<i>Um, I'm confirming a suspicion.</i>

40:28.134 --> 40:30.719
<i>And once you do,
will it make you happier?</i>

40:33.305 --> 40:35.057
<i>No.</i>

40:38.769 --> 40:40.980
<i>You're beautiful
when you're honest.</i>

40:49.655 --> 40:52.032
<i>haunting music</i>

41:08.507 --> 41:11.635
<i>Why are you... here,</i>

41:11.677 --> 41:14.138
Adam?

41:16.182 --> 41:18.142
<i>I was just getting a drink.</i>

41:20.019 --> 41:21.562
<i>But I don't know now.</i>

41:22.146 --> 41:24.565
<i>I'm starting to think
maybe something out there</i>

41:24.607 --> 41:27.651
<i>has other ideas.</i>

41:28.527 --> 41:31.113
<i>I don't ask where or why.</i>

41:31.864 --> 41:33.199
<i>I just go.</i>

41:39.830 --> 41:41.790
<i>Your friend phoned a winner.</i>

41:41.832 --> 41:43.334
<i>Who did you call?</i>

41:43.375 --> 41:45.461
Oh, just someone
I thought was a friend,

41:45.503 --> 41:47.505
<i>and turned out I was right.</i>

41:47.546 --> 41:50.132
<i>Okay. Kevyn Tan.</i>

41:50.174 --> 41:52.343
<i>Kevyn? Why-why did you call him?</i>

41:52.384 --> 41:54.887
<i>Mm, because he's a cop
and because we've been</i>

41:54.929 --> 41:56.388
<i>texting back and forth and...</i>

41:56.430 --> 41:57.515
<i>Oh, oh, fine.</i>

41:57.556 --> 41:58.682
<i>He thinks I'm you.</i>

41:59.725 --> 42:01.060
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

42:01.101 --> 42:02.603
<i>What's the big deal?</i>

42:02.645 --> 42:05.022
<i>He was looking at you
like he wanted to ravage you</i>

42:05.064 --> 42:06.857
<i>right then and there in the bar.</i>

42:06.899 --> 42:08.943
<i>So I thought, "What the heck?</i>

42:08.984 --> 42:11.320
<i>Let's see what can happen
for these crazy kids."</i>

42:11.362 --> 42:13.531

<i>What have you been
saying to him?</i>

42:18.410 --> 42:20.371
<i>Well, mainly, I've just been
trying to channel you,</i>

42:20.412 --> 42:23.666
<i>so I've been being
dark and deadpan.</i>

42:23.707 --> 42:26.961
<i>-Yeah, I can only imagine.
- Yeah, kind of like that.</i>

42:27.002 --> 42:30.047
<i>Do you know how weird you are?</i>

42:30.089 --> 42:32.258
Oh, please don't be mad.

42:32.299 --> 42:34.051
<i>It's a really long drive home,</i>

42:34.093 --> 42:36.512
<i>and uncomfortable silences
make me uncomfortable.</i>

42:36.554 --> 42:37.846
<i>We're not going home.</i>

42:37.888 --> 42:39.557
<i>Where are we going?</i>

42:56.490 --> 42:58.033
<i>Hey.</i>

42:58.075 --> 43:01.036
<i>I found a couple extra blankets,
if you want one.</i>

43:02.663 --> 43:04.039
<i>Thanks.</i>

43:07.042 --> 43:09.420
<i>I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings, okay?</i>

43:09.962 --> 43:13.257
<i>I have no idea
what's right or wrong out here.</i>

43:13.299 --> 43:16.176
<i>I was just following my gut
so that we...</i>

43:16.218 --> 43:18.012
<i>wouldn't die of thirst.</i>

43:23.058 --> 43:25.352
<i>I don't know about you, but...</i>

43:26.478 --> 43:28.188
<i>...I'm really scared.</i>

43:29.648 --> 43:32.359
<i>They should've come for us
by now, right?</i>

44:00.971 --> 44:03.307
<i>The worst is behind us, okay?</i>

44:04.850 --> 44:07.269
<i>We survived
a fucking plane crash.</i>

I can't just...
I can't just be like this now.

45:07.871 --> 45:10.374
<i>Why couldn't I have died?</i>

45:11.291 --> 45:14.253
<i>-Because we needed you.</i>

45:16.004 --> 45:18.215
<i>And I'm here for you, Ben.</i>
