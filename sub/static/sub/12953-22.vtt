01:29.089 --> 01:32.885
DSR team is supposed to be here. Contact A.P.O.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.476
We've got Mr. Bristow on sat-comm.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.770
Jack, what's your situation?

01:43.854 --> 01:46.106
We're at the rendezvous point. Still waiting on the DSR team.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.066
We'll give them five more minutes, then move on.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.776
Have we made any progress with the russians?

01:49.818 --> 01:51.361
No, director Chase is in Washington.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.238
They've organized a coalition to pressure the russians

01:53.322 --> 01:55.073
to call off the air strike, but so far, no luck.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.410
They do understand that destroying the device with conventional explosives

01:58.950 --> 02:01.990
will cause enough toxic fallout to make Chernobyl look like a kitchen fire?

02:02.030 --> 02:03.910
Yeah, their official position is they're not buying it,

02:03.950 --> 02:06.710
which gives you about two hours to deactivate the device.

02:06.877 --> 02:10.506
Dad, we got a signal from the DSR team's transponder.

02:10.589 --> 02:11.882
They're a block and a half away.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.050
We'll be in touch.

02:13.884 --> 02:17.262
The russians rely on the Milsat satellite network to vector the bombs, right?

02:17.387 --> 02:19.181
If I can hack into it, I can shut it down.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.266
And violate several thousand international laws?

02:21.350 --> 02:23.644
We're talking about the end of the world. I'm not worried about a tribunal.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.813
That's a good point. Go, go, go, go.

02:34.238 --> 02:37.199
- It's operational.
- Have you notified our cells?

02:37.241 --> 02:39.284
- We're on schedule.
- Good.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.417
It won't be long before you see her again.

02:49.211 --> 02:52.464
I know Nadia. She's gonna make us proud.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.274
The signal's coming from right here.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.203
We should keep moving.

03:28.834 --> 03:29.668
Show yourself!

03:48.270 --> 03:49.313
Brodien.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.398
Bristow?

03:52.524 --> 03:53.942
Oh, for god's sakes.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.028
What are you --

03:56.945 --> 03:58.655
I thought you were relieved of duty.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.782
Well, don't believe everything you hear.

04:00.866 --> 04:01.992
What happened here?

04:02.284 --> 04:05.037
Uh, let's just say those tranqs --

04:05.495 --> 04:06.997
they're not gonna do you any good.

04:07.623 --> 04:08.916
Not on the infected.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.587
They're like rabid dogs.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.130
They travel in packs.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.507
It only took one night to wipe out my entire team.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.176
You're the last one alive?

04:19.301 --> 04:20.677
Yeah. That's right.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.432
I don't know how many are out there -- hundreds could be thousands.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.725
What about the rest? Where are they?

04:26.850 --> 04:28.352
Dead, if we're lucky.

04:28.602 --> 04:32.523
When there's no one left to kill, they turn on each other.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.233
The municipal water supply was tainted.

04:34.316 --> 04:38.278
And the device is broadcasting a subaudible frequency off any spectrum.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.030
Anyone within the radius of the signal

04:40.155 --> 04:42.824
who drank the water has been physiologically altered.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.451
Are we gonna just shoot them?

04:44.535 --> 04:45.285
Yes.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.079
I mean, it's either them or us.

04:47.496 --> 04:50.499
They're already gone anyway. We're putting them out of their misery.

04:51.083 --> 04:51.959
There is no cure.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.337
Once you're infected, there's no reversing the symptoms.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.839
What have you learned about the device?

04:56.922 --> 04:57.631
Uh...

05:00.509 --> 05:01.718
best we can tell,

05:03.135 --> 05:05.013
the epicenter is, uh,

05:05.097 --> 05:08.183
4 miles northwest over the Oransky building -- right here.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.020
In that case, the control center for the device should be located on the rooftop.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.107
I've taken out the city's power grid. The device keeps running.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.567
Irina knows how to bring it down safely.

05:18.250 --> 05:19.862
Irina?

05:21.655 --> 05:22.739
Irina Derevko?

05:23.615 --> 05:26.910
The device has been modified to run off an internal energy source.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.663
We need to get to the roof of that building.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.876
Okay, uh, right, but we can't drive.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.711
All the roads are closed off with gridlock.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.296
We can get through town through the subway tunnels.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.965
It's a straight shot to the Oransky building.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.468
There should be an emergency battery system to power up the cars.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.345
Those tunnels are pitch black.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.930
There's only one way in or out.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.975
I'm not saying I'm looking forward to it.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.437
All right. Let's go.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.485
They're here.

06:02.738 --> 06:06.491
Less than two hours before the russians launch their strike.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.118
Nothing can stop us.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.288
Regardless, we should eliminate all possibility.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.124
I'll lead the assault team.

06:15.751 --> 06:16.877
Nadia.

06:18.629 --> 06:19.463
What about Nadia?

06:19.922 --> 06:20.923
Bring her back.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.884
Give her the option to join us.

06:24.468 --> 06:25.969
I was going to.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.264
Let's go.

06:34.537 --> 06:35.729
Damn it.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.857
It's too secure. I can't get in from the outside.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.943
Unless we have a valid access code, this isn't gonna work.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.027
So get an access code.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.697
Only russian military officials have access codes to those. Hence the word access.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.242
We've managed harder. Come on. There's got to be a way.

06:49.368 --> 06:50.619
What would Jack do in this situation?

06:50.702 --> 06:52.538
Jack is the king of this sort of thing.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.373
Well, first he'd probably glower a bit, right?

06:54.456 --> 06:58.919
And then he'd probably blackmail or torture somebody. Right?

07:01.046 --> 07:02.089
You're  a genius.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.633
You, Eric Weiss, are a genius.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.264
I thought Sloane turned the Blackwell Index over to Langley.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.723
He didn't. It's complicated.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.100
Not really. Sloane's evil --

07:13.141 --> 07:15.811
why wouldn't he hold on to blackmail material on world leaders?

07:15.978 --> 07:19.022
Okay, here it is. Russian deputy defense minister Karkov.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.526
We find the right dirt, he'll be begging to give us the code.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.069
I think we found your passion.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.321
- What's this guy into?
- Let's take a look.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.034
-  Ooh. Is that A...
- Whoa, hello.

07:30.076 --> 07:33.286
- I hope not.
- Wow.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.957
Jack, we found a russian minister off the Blackwell Index

07:37.124 --> 07:39.960
who can get us access to the Milsat. We'll ke you posted.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.088
Copy that. Marshall and Weiss are working on the russians.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.882
Stubborn bunch, your countrymen.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.466
We like to control our own fate.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.595
You never put much faith in that, did you? Fate. Destiny.

07:49.678 --> 07:53.974
About as much faith as I put in horoscopes, fortune cookies.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.060
Look.

08:00.772 --> 08:01.648
Rambaldi wrote,

08:01.773 --> 08:05.986
"when bloodred horses run to the streets and angels from the sky,

08:07.070 --> 08:09.281
the chosen one and the passenger will clash."

08:11.992 --> 08:13.702
"And only one of them will survive."

08:16.121 --> 08:18.874
You really are through the looking glass, aren't you?

08:21.293 --> 08:24.671
When I see angels fall from the sky, I'll start to worry.

08:26.006 --> 08:30.052
I just can't shake the feeling that tonight, one of my daughters will perish.

08:34.972 --> 08:35.933
This is it.

08:41.230 --> 08:44.024
Hey, Brodien, it looks like that ear healed up pretty nicely.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.192
Yeah.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.403
And if you plan on putting any more holes in me,

08:48.904 --> 08:50.989
just go ahead and tell me now. All right?

09:12.027 --> 09:13.011
Brodien?

09:13.912 --> 09:15.514
Hang in there.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.520
Go.

09:22.980 --> 09:23.689
End this.

09:35.909 --> 09:36.827
We should move.

09:38.996 --> 09:39.830
Now!

10:30.714 --> 10:31.757
We found the switching room.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.675
We'll set green lights all the way down the line.

10:34.843 --> 10:38.472
It should only take me a few minutes to redirect the power to the drive wheels.

10:38.514 --> 10:39.807
How are we on the brakes?

10:39.849 --> 10:41.058
The calipers have seized.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.018
Must have happened when the power shut down.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.390
But if we cut the hydraulic lines and bleed the fluid,

10:45.430 --> 10:47.680
they should disengage, but we'll have no manual stopping power.

10:47.770 --> 10:51.060
We can set the track switch at the Oransky station to trigger an emergency stop.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.487
Right. Be careful out there.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.536
You shouldn't wait.

11:01.745 --> 11:02.454
For what?

11:02.871 --> 11:04.039
I saw the ring.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.544
Yeah, you know what? You killed my father.

11:08.961 --> 11:11.046
The way I see it, I don't have to ask for your blessings.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.465
Despite that, you may have them.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.717
Along with some advice.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.470
Marital advice from you. Wonderful.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.556
Like what, don't betray your spouse?

11:21.348 --> 11:22.516
Yeah, that'd be one of them.

11:23.934 --> 11:27.354
But even between a husband and a wife, some secrets are acceptable.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.525
However, your activities are not.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.320
What are you talking about?

11:35.529 --> 11:38.031
You're not as covert as you'd like to think.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.326
Consider my life an object lesson.

11:41.994 --> 11:46.540
If you don't want tond up like Jack and me, tell Sydney the truth.

12:02.256 --> 12:03.557
It's not catching.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.058
They're at either end of the platform.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.145
Maybe when the train's at the station, they have to be set manually --

12:08.270 --> 12:09.438
we can do it ourselves.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.105
Okay.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.528
You still feeling it, too?

12:17.571 --> 12:19.531
Like something awful's gonna happen.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.199
I know.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.370
Vaughn asked me to marry him.

12:25.913 --> 12:26.914
Sydney...

12:28.540 --> 12:30.042
that's amazing.

12:30.459 --> 12:33.170
I'm sure there are plenty of brides who want to kill their maid of honor.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.380
I'm not one of them.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.466
Okay.

12:38.467 --> 12:39.927
I'll take the switch in front.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.084
Whatever! I wrote this program in five minutes, you perv!

13:12.167 --> 13:13.669
I'm gonna make this real simple for you.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.672
We need your Milsat access codes. You either give it to us now,

13:16.713 --> 13:20.342
or every major news organization will get the tuva photos by morning.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.970
"A," I don't know what you're talking about.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.305
"B," I'm running a trace on this call.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.849
Great. I look forward to meeting you.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.767
While I've got you on the line, let me ask you --

13:28.892 --> 13:31.395
what's the significance of the green balloons?

13:35.649 --> 13:40.529
Alpha-5-7-2-8-1-1-black.

13:41.029 --> 13:44.032
Now, let me be clear. If those photos ever --

13:44.116 --> 13:48.078
Oh, sure thing, minister. Or should I call you "cowboy"?

13:49.329 --> 13:50.289
Got it!

14:10.392 --> 14:11.143
D a.

14:27.159 --> 14:29.077
- Okay, code's good. We're in.
- Good.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.746
Okay.

14:32.831 --> 14:36.043
- Wait a second. This is odd.
- What? What's odd?

14:36.084 --> 14:38.086
Well, there's a signal coming out of Sovogda.

14:38.504 --> 14:41.840
Someone's trying to uplink an encrypted broadcast connect to the russians' network.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.343
It could be Elena, but why would she broadcast over a closed network?

14:44.468 --> 14:45.594
- I don't know.
- Can you find out?

14:45.677 --> 14:46.553
Let me see.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.474
Jack, we cut the brake lines.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.559
As soon as you restore power, we'll be good to roll.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.686
I'm almost done here. Give me a sec.

15:16.834 --> 15:17.918
Need any help?

15:18.252 --> 15:19.503
No, just another minute.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.136
Where's Nadia?

15:28.303 --> 15:30.138
- She isn't back yet?
- No.

15:33.642 --> 15:34.810
Guys, they're coming!

15:35.018 --> 15:37.938
- Nadia, get out of there!
- Got it!

15:40.607 --> 15:42.109
Nadia! Vaughn!

15:47.906 --> 15:49.575
Nadia! Nadia!

15:56.999 --> 15:58.375
Dad, stop the train!

15:58.750 --> 15:59.835
Sydney, we can't!

15:59.960 --> 16:01.086
Stop the damn train!

16:02.629 --> 16:03.463
Nadia!

16:05.507 --> 16:06.341
Sydney!

16:06.800 --> 16:07.926
Come here, come here!

16:18.045 --> 16:19.354
No!

16:22.774 --> 16:23.525
Syd...

16:43.462 --> 16:44.796
Your sister's alive.

16:58.510 --> 17:00.270
Hold on! We're coming into the station!

17:29.299 --> 17:32.219
These are Elena's men, sent here to kill you.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.680
I suppose you're expecting a thank-you.

17:34.847 --> 17:36.431
There's no time for sarcasm, Jack.

17:36.932 --> 17:39.643
Elena's men have already primed the world's drinking water.

17:39.935 --> 17:42.729
No one else can stop her if we don't get to her within the next few hours.

17:42.813 --> 17:47.359
Wait a minute. You expect us  believe that you came here to help us? Please!

17:47.442 --> 17:49.653
I have never been disingenuous with you on this, Sydney.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.113
I allied myself to Elena

17:51.196 --> 17:53.866
in order to put an end to her plan, to shoulder the risk myself.

17:54.241 --> 17:57.327
But she's built in security devices, and I haven't had enough time.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.079
I've heard quite enough, Arvin.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.706
Jack, I've been inside the operation.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.958
If you want to stop Elena, this is how we're gonna do it.

18:03.125 --> 18:07.171
She's secured herself inside an antiquated C.O.G. facility below the Oransky building.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.965
Sydney, Vaughn, open a line to A.P.O. We're gonna need Marshall.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.135
Jack, you take point. Irina, forgive me, but there's no time for pleasantries.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.182
You're no longer in charge of this team.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.685
Jack, we might have made a breakthrough.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.478
Marshall detected a signal coming out of the city.

18:23.562 --> 18:27.065
We believe Elena is trying to uplink to the Milsat network.

18:27.149 --> 18:28.609
Do we know why?

18:28.692 --> 18:31.904
I decoded the signal -- it's a subaudible frequency below the range of human hearing,

18:31.945 --> 18:34.156
the same frequency being used by the Mueller device.

18:34.239 --> 18:37.326
She's using the russian satellite network to distribute that frequency worldwide.

18:37.576 --> 18:40.329
If she succeeds, the effects we're seeing will occur globally,

18:40.412 --> 18:42.623
everywhere the water's been primed. That's her endgame.

18:42.748 --> 18:45.626
I know we told you there were two hours before the air strike,

18:45.834 --> 18:48.003
but the instant the russians scramble those bombers,

18:48.086 --> 18:50.130
the satellite network, it's going to go online.

18:50.214 --> 18:53.050
The minute that happens, that signal -- it's going to be broadcast.

18:53.342 --> 18:57.095
She is super-tricky -- counting on the russian air strike all along. It's what she wants.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.347
How much time do we have?

18:58.472 --> 18:59.556
40 minutes, give or take.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.476
We need to get to the roof of that building and shut down the device.

19:02.768 --> 19:05.646
Can you send us intel on the facility -- thermal scans?

19:06.188 --> 19:08.941
Okay, just give me a sec.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.237
No good. The Mueller device is causing too much interference.

19:13.278 --> 19:15.822
The best I can do is building blueprints. Uploading now.

19:19.743 --> 19:20.619
Got it.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.539
Put in a call to Chase --  Washington should be kept up to speed

19:23.622 --> 19:26.291
so they can order foreign leadership to begin preparations.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.210
- Good luck.
- Yeah, likewise.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.504
Our best bet is the northwest entrance.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.422
We can approach it through the alley without being seen.

19:32.506 --> 19:35.467
If she anticipated that, all her defenses would be there.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.679
You're going to help us get inside that building and up to the roof.

19:38.804 --> 19:41.265
- We have 40 minutes.
- Of course.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.268
If we fail, I will personally put a bullet through your skull.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.436
You won't have to.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.690
I can take you up to the roof. It's not a problem --

19:49.773 --> 19:51.525
Elena left it unguarded.

19:51.608 --> 19:55.612
Once you disable the device, the toxins that are inside will

19:56.154 --> 19:57.865
dissipate into the atmosphere.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.826
What you're talking about is a suicide mission.

20:00.951 --> 20:02.536
Just get me to the roof.

20:02.995 --> 20:05.998
I can cut the wire to the relay -- reverse the ionization.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.709
Aside from the impact, the water will be harmless.

20:09.001 --> 20:14.047
I'll take you, but your sister changed the wiring scheme. It's one of her fail-safes.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.382
In that case...

20:16.216 --> 20:18.010
take me to my sister.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.428
I will.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.014
Where's Nadia?

20:26.685 --> 20:28.353
Phoenix, Raaptor, do you copy?

20:29.354 --> 20:30.647
Can anybody hear me?

20:31.398 --> 20:32.274
Sydney!

21:00.802 --> 21:01.637
Hello?

21:02.554 --> 21:03.597
Is someone there?

21:04.640 --> 21:05.807
Help  me!

21:07.851 --> 21:08.727
Please.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.027
Don't hurt me!

21:19.196 --> 21:20.447
What happened to you?

21:20.614 --> 21:23.116
My leg -- I think it's broken.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.994
Thank god. I've been here for hours.

21:27.537 --> 21:30.374
It was risky going out like you did.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.210
How did you know I wasn't one of them?

21:33.585 --> 21:34.670
Because...

21:35.921 --> 21:37.714
...I know who you are.

21:52.104 --> 21:53.313
Sweetheart.

21:54.273 --> 21:56.191
I'm sorry it had to be done this way.

21:56.900 --> 22:00.070
I hope you understand. I never wanted to hurt you.

22:01.280 --> 22:04.408
I never wanted children of my own, Nadia.

22:04.992 --> 22:06.410
Then you came along.

22:08.370 --> 22:13.083
And ever since then, no matter how far I was from you,

22:14.251 --> 22:17.629
I always thought of you as my daughter.

22:18.463 --> 22:19.506
Don't touch me.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.177
You have a choice.

22:24.553 --> 22:27.890
You can embrace your anger and hate me...

22:29.433 --> 22:32.477
...or you can join me.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.063
The flood has begun.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.900
Only precious few will survive.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.113
There she is.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.200
I see her now --

22:47.534 --> 22:48.577
your mother.

22:52.331 --> 22:54.917
She used to look at me with those eyes.

22:56.585 --> 23:01.173
It's time that you accept the life you have ahead of you.

23:03.133 --> 23:09.014
I know it's not easy. Greatness never is.

23:18.315 --> 23:19.566
You're right.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.488
I see my future.

23:27.741 --> 23:30.661
Two minutes from now, I see myself killing you.

23:36.625 --> 23:39.294
The only reason you want me to be on your side

23:40.087 --> 23:44.216
is because you believe I'm the one to stop Sydney Bristow.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.760
But she's my sister.

23:52.266 --> 23:54.017
You're nothing to me.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.605
I am sorry you feel that way.

24:17.916 --> 24:18.876
What's that?

24:21.086 --> 24:22.629
Don't worry, darling.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.257
It's only tap water.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.136
I will never betray my sister.

24:31.263 --> 24:32.389
We'll see.

24:46.236 --> 24:47.029
Syd.

24:47.905 --> 24:48.947
Did I forget something?

24:49.031 --> 24:51.950
Yeah -- me. I'm coming with you.

24:52.701 --> 24:53.911
Did my dad change the plans?

24:53.994 --> 24:55.871
No, I did. I'm joining you on the roof.

24:56.288 --> 24:59.499
It's a one-person job. My mom will relay up the wiring instructions.

24:59.583 --> 25:01.126
- I can disarm the device myself.
- I know you can.

25:01.168 --> 25:04.630
But you can't outrun the wall of water that thing's gonna turn into.

25:04.713 --> 25:05.839
How are you gonna help me?

25:05.923 --> 25:07.174
We'll figure something out.

25:07.633 --> 25:09.635
You'll run faster if I'm chasing you.

25:10.469 --> 25:11.512
I'll be fine.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.305
And they need you in the bunker.

25:13.347 --> 25:15.641
- Syd...
- If we don't get Elena...

25:16.517 --> 25:17.726
Don't say it.

25:22.731 --> 25:24.066
I'll see you in a few minutes.

25:25.984 --> 25:26.485
Okay.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.367
Just in case, yes.

25:33.992 --> 25:35.953
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I want to marry you.

25:50.467 --> 25:51.593
It's perfect.

25:53.470 --> 25:54.429
So are you.

26:05.232 --> 26:06.024
Go.

26:07.234 --> 26:08.944
- I'll see you.
- I know.

26:32.551 --> 26:36.471
That's right, a polymorphic computer virus capable of infecting military-grade encryption.

26:36.555 --> 26:39.516
You think you can handle that? Not 10 minutes -- I need it now!

26:39.641 --> 26:41.643
Just get it done, okay? Thank you.

26:42.394 --> 26:43.312
Are we close?

26:43.729 --> 26:46.023
That's not really a helpful question right now, okay?

26:46.607 --> 26:47.733
Don't blame yourself.

26:47.816 --> 26:50.277
This satellite network was designed to withstand World War III.

26:54.364 --> 26:56.533
I just got off the phone with my buddy at the secret service.

26:56.617 --> 26:58.952
They've initiated the "continuity of government" protocol.

26:59.119 --> 27:00.913
The president, his cabinet, their family members --

27:00.996 --> 27:02.873
all being evacuated to underground command centers.

27:04.708 --> 27:07.144
Somewhere in the back of my mind I've kidded myself,

27:07.228 --> 27:09.129
but I thought maybe I'd be on the list.

27:09.338 --> 27:10.339
Yeah.

27:11.173 --> 27:12.799
It's kind of like high school all over again.

27:13.091 --> 27:15.344
The cool kids are having a party, and I'm not invited.

27:18.722 --> 27:20.015
All right, there's still time left.

27:20.098 --> 27:21.600
Let's not give up on them yet.

27:25.020 --> 27:29.691
Hey, honey. Hi. Uh... no, I don't have a lot of time. I just --

27:30.984 --> 27:32.653
I just wanted to tell you I love you.

27:33.070 --> 27:34.613
I don't get to tell you that often enough.

27:37.032 --> 27:39.159
No, I haven't been drinking. I'm just --

27:39.826 --> 27:41.620
I'm just gonna be home early tonight, okay?

27:42.796 --> 27:43.789
Bye.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.795
Russian bombers are taxiing to the runway.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.296
Have you uploaded the signal?

27:51.713 --> 27:55.133
Once Milsat in on line, the signal will be broadcast worldwide.

27:57.094 --> 27:58.178
Sloane's back.

28:12.860 --> 28:13.944
Hello, sis.

28:17.656 --> 28:20.492
Ever since you were 11, there's something I wanted to do.

28:20.534 --> 28:20.993
You --

28:22.703 --> 28:23.287
Now.

28:37.176 --> 28:38.760
Can't retract the signal from this terminal.

28:38.969 --> 28:40.512
Find the relay room and destroy it.

29:19.259 --> 29:20.010
Nadia!

29:22.095 --> 29:23.222
Nadia, it's me.

29:24.097 --> 29:24.932
It's Sydney.

29:27.017 --> 29:27.935
I don't want to hurt you.

29:31.730 --> 29:32.689
Sydney, what's happening?

29:32.856 --> 29:35.317
It's Nadia -- she's guarding the device. She's infected.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.528
This is all your doing.

29:37.778 --> 29:39.112
You have to take her out.

29:39.530 --> 29:40.572
No, dad.

29:41.406 --> 29:42.616
She's my sister.

29:42.950 --> 29:43.867
Listen to me.

29:44.326 --> 29:45.827
She's not your sister anymore.

29:46.078 --> 29:47.162
But mom...

29:49.873 --> 29:50.916
I know.

29:57.544 --> 30:01.193
Please, Nadia. Please let me help you.

30:07.797 --> 30:09.852
- Sydney?
- Sydney, what's happening?

30:11.854 --> 30:13.063
Nadia, stop.

30:42.301 --> 30:44.469
The relay's blown. Check the signal strength.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.139
No good, Vaughn. The signal's still broadcasting.

30:47.222 --> 30:48.932
I've planned this for five years.

30:49.266 --> 30:52.686
Don't you think I've accounted for every possibility?

30:54.479 --> 30:57.232
- Vaughn? Is Sloane with you?
- No. He's not with you?

30:57.357 --> 30:59.484
- Get to the roof right now.
- On my way.

31:36.355 --> 31:37.940
Okay, mom, I've removed the panel.

31:38.524 --> 31:39.942
Do you see the master circuit board?

31:40.234 --> 31:42.027
I see a lot of circuit boards.

31:42.152 --> 31:43.862
It's the one closest to the power supply.

31:44.196 --> 31:46.865
Trace the ground wire. It should lead you to the coil.

31:47.199 --> 31:47.824
Got it.

31:53.372 --> 31:54.206
Okay, I'm there.

31:55.624 --> 31:58.085
There should be two wires -- one black, one yellow.

31:58.210 --> 31:58.919
No.

31:59.044 --> 32:01.505
She's changed them out. One wire's blue. The other's white.

32:01.755 --> 32:02.881
Hold on, Sydney.

32:06.844 --> 32:08.971
I'll give you one chance to do the right thing.

32:10.389 --> 32:12.307
Not that you were ever any good at that.

32:13.475 --> 32:14.268
Which wire?

32:14.893 --> 32:15.894
It's useless.

32:16.395 --> 32:17.563
In a few minutes,

32:17.729 --> 32:21.066
when the signal broadcasts, the whole world will be different.

32:22.150 --> 32:24.528
However you plan on torturing me,

32:24.653 --> 32:27.906
I'll hold out at least for that long.

32:28.699 --> 32:30.075
I'm not gonna torture you.

32:31.660 --> 32:32.870
I'm gonna let him do it.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.455
And he really doesn't care for you,

32:35.664 --> 32:37.875
especially after you tricked him into killing me.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.919
One thing you should know about Jack --

32:41.086 --> 32:43.463
he hates being anybody's puppet.

32:44.423 --> 32:46.925
I'm actually hoping you don't tell us what we need to know.

32:50.429 --> 32:53.849
There's a 50/50 chance Sydney cuts the right wire.

32:56.810 --> 32:58.562
I'm willing to take those odds...

33:00.522 --> 33:03.650
if it means I can stand here and watch you turn into an animal.

33:05.027 --> 33:07.029
You're not a gambling man, Jack.

33:07.154 --> 33:10.240
I didn't used to be, but it's been a rather interesting year for me.

33:11.325 --> 33:14.036
It's made me re-evaluate certain parts of my life.

33:15.495 --> 33:18.916
I'm trying to have more fun these days.

33:21.835 --> 33:22.628
Wait.

33:23.504 --> 33:27.174
How do I know you won't inject me anyway?

33:28.425 --> 33:28.967
You don't.

33:33.555 --> 33:36.683
White. Tell her to cut the white wire.

33:39.394 --> 33:42.814
Sydney, cut the blue wire. And then run like hell.

33:42.898 --> 33:44.608
You have 15 seconds before the ball bursts.

33:44.691 --> 33:46.485
Copy that. Cutting the blue wire.

33:54.493 --> 33:55.702
Nadi-- Nadia.

34:23.230 --> 34:24.438
I had no choice.

34:32.155 --> 34:33.114
Sydney, we got to go.

34:35.784 --> 34:36.827
Get her into the elevator.

34:41.915 --> 34:42.833
She's still breathing.

34:47.087 --> 34:48.130
Sydney, let's go.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.440
She's bleeding out.

35:07.816 --> 35:08.817
Put some pressure on it.

35:17.117 --> 35:18.327
The device is coming apart.

36:06.542 --> 36:08.877
Raptor, do you copy? Come on. Phoenix.

36:09.753 --> 36:13.173
Raptor, Phoenix, do you copy? Come on. Anyone?

36:13.257 --> 36:14.800
Hold on. I'll try an alternate signal.

36:16.343 --> 36:17.469
- Anything?
- Nothing.

36:18.303 --> 36:19.972
All right, what's the status of the building?

36:22.808 --> 36:24.726
It's not there anymore.

36:30.524 --> 36:33.277
3-9-alpha-2-4. We've transitioned out of the bunker on the street.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.071
Requesting immediate evac. Med-support needed. Popping smoke now.

36:41.493 --> 36:42.870
The chopper should be here any minute.

36:45.622 --> 36:47.332
We both know how this is supposed to play out.

36:48.625 --> 36:51.170
You bring me back to the states, turn me over to your superiors.

36:53.839 --> 36:56.383
On foot, you could reach the border by daybreak.

36:57.718 --> 36:59.678
What about the agency? What would you tell them?

37:00.262 --> 37:01.388
Oh, I think they know --

37:02.681 --> 37:05.851
no one can hold on to Irina Derevko for too long.

37:24.995 --> 37:26.121
Take care of your sister.

37:26.788 --> 37:27.664
I will.

37:30.709 --> 37:33.504
Three years ago, when I told you you were the chosen one,

37:34.171 --> 37:36.131
that only you could take down the greatest evil,

37:37.257 --> 37:40.344
I know your mind must have been overwhelmed with confusion.

37:42.221 --> 37:47.518
But tonight you should recognize that you've done just that.

37:51.647 --> 37:52.773
I'm so proud of you.

37:59.988 --> 38:00.864
Thank you.

38:05.244 --> 38:05.994
Sydney?

38:08.914 --> 38:10.958
You may not see me on your wedding day...

38:14.127 --> 38:15.462
but I'll see you.

39:01.967 --> 39:04.261
- Nadia. Is she --
- Her vitals are stable.

39:04.469 --> 39:07.681
They're keeping her under sedation until we find an antidote for her condition.

39:09.141 --> 39:12.269
What about the survivors? Russians must be running tests --

39:12.352 --> 39:14.062
There aren't any survivors.

39:14.646 --> 39:18.567
The russian military executed all remaining civilians inside Sovogda.

39:19.193 --> 39:19.985
Of course.

39:20.569 --> 39:24.406
Otherwise it would belie their claim of a chemical explosion.

39:28.118 --> 39:29.369
It's because of me...

39:30.704 --> 39:32.039
because of my choices.

39:35.250 --> 39:38.045
I've hurt the most precious thing in my life.

39:39.338 --> 39:40.714
We'll get her back.

39:41.757 --> 39:43.884
Whatever it takes, we'll find a cure.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.223
Thank you.

39:50.098 --> 39:51.725
I've arranged for you to see Nadia.

39:53.143 --> 39:54.394
Sydney.

39:56.730 --> 39:58.232
I didn't think I would ever say this,

39:59.983 --> 40:02.736
but I believe you were trying to do the right thing.

40:04.530 --> 40:05.572
Thank you.

40:36.895 --> 40:38.689
- I had a thought.
- Yeah?

40:41.316 --> 40:43.360
What if we just blow off the big-wedding thing?

40:44.820 --> 40:46.196
What if we just do it on the beach?

40:47.281 --> 40:48.657
- The beach?
- What do you think?

40:49.032 --> 40:51.785
I like it. Barefoot on the beach, you'd look sexy as hell.

40:52.286 --> 40:53.453
Oh, but wait. What about your dad?

40:53.537 --> 40:55.914
He doesn't look like the kind who likes sand between his toes.

40:55.998 --> 40:56.582
That's true.

40:57.541 --> 40:59.835
So...we won't invite him.

41:00.919 --> 41:02.004
Your father?

41:02.171 --> 41:04.506
What if we don't invite anyone? We just elope?

41:05.507 --> 41:06.425
Are you serious?

41:07.217 --> 41:08.302
I would love it.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.722
All right. Then we'll elope.

41:18.228 --> 41:20.022
Have I told you that I love you?

41:22.149 --> 41:24.067
Yeah. Go ahead, tell me again.

41:24.234 --> 41:25.194
I love you.

41:26.820 --> 41:27.988
I love you, too.

41:28.906 --> 41:30.449
I know. Say it again.

41:33.327 --> 41:34.745
I love you, Syd.

41:35.037 --> 41:36.330
That's why I need to tell you something.

41:37.664 --> 41:39.666
Just so there's no secrets between us.

41:39.833 --> 41:40.459
Okay.

41:41.460 --> 41:44.588
Whatever it is, I can handle it. Just don't tell me you're a bad guy.

41:47.966 --> 41:49.343
You're not a bad guy, are you?

41:49.426 --> 41:50.886
I guess that depends who you ask.

41:50.969 --> 41:51.762
Vaughn...

41:52.429 --> 41:53.722
It's from a long time ago.

41:53.972 --> 41:55.098
It's before we met.

41:55.557 --> 41:56.934
Actually, it's the reason we met.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.896
It's no accident that I was the one you came to

42:00.979 --> 42:03.232
when you walked in the CIA with your story about SD-6.

42:03.357 --> 42:04.525
Wait. I don't understand.

42:04.650 --> 42:07.486
Vaughn, what are you telling me?

42:08.529 --> 42:10.656
Well, for starters, my name isn't Michael Vaughn.
