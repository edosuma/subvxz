In our village, there was once
an honorable but poor man

33:11.875 --> 33:13.958
who wanted a home of his own.

33:16.125 --> 33:19.958
He wanted it so badly,
he began to steal from others.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.083
One day...

33:24.666 --> 33:28.041
he stole from an old man
who lived by the river.

33:31.083 --> 33:35.375
He didn't know that this man was an apeth.

33:38.333 --> 33:39.791

33:42.583 --> 33:45.958
And so the thief could not know
that when he built his home...

33:47.708 --> 33:50.583
the apeth, too, would live there.

33:53.916 --> 33:56.041
So, before long,

33:57.333 --> 34:01.041
the walls would whisper
the spells of the apeth.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.208
From the shadows...

34:08.208 --> 34:10.000
the dead would come.

34:10.875 --> 34:13.250
The apeth would not stop...

34:14.625 --> 34:18.250
until he had consumed the man entirely.

34:24.541 --> 34:27.458
An apeth has arisen from the ocean.

43:41.375 --> 43:42.416
[Rial sighs]

44:00.333 --> 44:02.375
Perhaps you think we're going mad.

44:02.791 --> 44:06.583
I think it's not healthy
for you to be alone all the time.

44:07.375 --> 44:08.791
Dwelling with your thoughts.

44:10.583 --> 44:12.458
Tomorrow, we will find you
something to do.

44:12.958 --> 44:14.333
Something in the community.

44:15.041 --> 44:17.041
Make friends, be good.

44:17.666 --> 44:19.583
-We are not like them.
-We can be.

44:23.166 --> 44:25.375
You don't wonder what it tells me?

44:29.083 --> 44:30.250
You are right.

44:31.291 --> 44:32.333
Maybe you are mad.

44:32.791 --> 44:35.125
Frightening yourself
with imaginary things in the dark.

44:35.208 --> 44:39.000
After all we've endured,
after what we have seen...

44:39.833 --> 44:43.333
what men can do, you think it is
bumps in the night that frighten me?

44:45.791 --> 44:48.208
You think I can be afraid of ghosts?

44:50.083 --> 44:51.291
[scoffs]

44:52.250 --> 44:54.291
It says I can get her back.

44:58.208 --> 45:00.500
And it says I should be afraid of you.

45:08.458 --> 45:09.875

So, Bol, what's goin' on?

50:50.875 --> 50:51.833
The house.

-Uh...

51:09.666 --> 51:12.333
Sure, yeah, we can look into that for you.

51:13.166 --> 51:14.833
But first, you have to tell me why.

51:15.750 --> 51:18.041
I mean, can you name me
one of the problems?

51:23.416 --> 51:25.000
There are... vermin.

51:25.958 --> 51:28.166
Rats and bugs.

51:28.750 --> 51:30.208
They are making us sick.

51:31.500 --> 51:32.625
Rial is very ill.

Has she seen a doctor?

-Yes.
-Good.

He says...

51:37.958 --> 51:39.458
"Get out of the house."

51:39.541 --> 51:40.958
We have to move.

51:41.750 --> 51:43.041
Where?

51:43.125 --> 51:44.666
[Adam] His house is bigger than mine.

51:44.750 --> 51:46.375
[man] Bigger than mine, too.

Uh...

51:54.791 --> 51:56.166
Look, mate, this is...

51:57.083 --> 51:59.875
this is gonna raise
a lot of questions... Bol.

52:01.666 --> 52:03.000
I... [swallows]

52:05.125 --> 52:07.125
They're gonna ask you
why you're not adapting.

-Adapting?

abroad.

52:30.375 --> 52:31.791
[chair creaking]

52:32.750 --> 52:36.833
[sighs] The point is, many of us, we end
up in places we never thought we'd be.

52:36.916 --> 52:38.541
But I think...

52:38.625 --> 52:42.125
I think that's life trying to show you
what kind of man you are.

52:43.833 --> 52:45.041
Do you know what I'm sayin'?

52:45.625 --> 52:47.791
I'm tryin' to work out
what kind of man you are, Bol.

52:49.041 --> 52:50.291
I just need a new house.

-And we'll get you one.

52:53.458 --> 52:54.416
-[Bol] Inquiry?
-Yeah.

52:54.500 --> 52:58.333
Look at the state of you. You're a mess.
You don't look well, mate, you look ill.

52:58.416 --> 53:00.541
You don't smell good. You smell bad.

53:01.208 --> 53:04.791
You're not making any sense.
It would have to be reported. And then...

53:06.416 --> 53:08.583
people, not me,
but people are then gonna ask,

53:08.666 --> 53:10.750
"Why is he bitin'
the hand that's feedin' him?"

53:11.625 --> 53:13.916
-We can live anywhere else.
-There's rats everywhere.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.166
-Anywhere else.
-Oh, right. So it's not about the rats.

53:18.208 --> 53:21.291

53:21.375 --> 53:22.625

-What is that?

53:23.375 --> 53:26.291
-What is it? Tell me.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.833
Can't be that bad, you're laughin'.

53:32.541 --> 53:34.833
If you want me to make a fuss,
mate, I will make a fuss.

53:34.916 --> 53:37.166
-Yes!
-If you want me to do it, then I will.

53:37.250 --> 53:39.500
Yes! [laughs]

54:51.250 --> 54:52.333
What?

54:53.666 --> 54:54.833
Why don't you just leave?

54:55.625 --> 54:57.083
We live here now.

54:57.458 --> 54:59.458
They're gonna kick you out anyway.

55:00.541 --> 55:01.791
I'm tryin' to help you.

55:23.208 --> 55:24.666
Must be big rats.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.250
Telling me that rats...

55:33.083 --> 55:34.250
did this?

55:37.166 --> 55:38.208
Come on, man.

55:41.125 --> 55:44.125
Well, I'm...
I'm gonna have to report it now.

55:44.208 --> 55:45.791
Please. Please...

55:45.875 --> 55:48.000
No, I'm gonna have to.
I'm gonna have to take photos.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.833
-No, please. No.
-[shutter clicking]

55:49.916 --> 55:51.000
No. No!

55:52.583 --> 55:54.000
Let me fix it.

55:58.041 --> 55:59.541
We are not going back.

56:01.208 --> 56:02.208
Please.

56:02.750 --> 56:05.583
We are one of the good ones. Remember?

56:07.625 --> 56:09.416
We are not going back.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.375
Yep. All right then, mist...

56:17.458 --> 56:20.000
Mr. Majur, we will let you off
with a warning this time.

56:20.083 --> 56:22.083
-Hang-- hang on a minute.
-Let me deal with it.

56:22.166 --> 56:24.375
[Rial] Have you told them about the witch?

56:25.666 --> 56:27.083
[footsteps]

56:29.458 --> 56:31.083
You haven't told them?

56:32.875 --> 56:33.750
[scoffs]

56:35.416 --> 56:38.166
There's a great beast in this house.

56:38.958 --> 56:40.791
It followed us here.

56:41.500 --> 56:44.625
My husband's been chasing it
all night with a hammer.

56:46.916 --> 56:49.041
It knows great magic.

56:49.625 --> 56:52.625
It's filling this house with ghosts.

56:53.333 --> 56:57.166
It torments my husband
with visits from her.

56:58.541 --> 56:59.916
Nyagak.

57:02.291 --> 57:05.666
But my husband is a very stubborn man.

57:08.875 --> 57:10.916
He still believes he can deny it.

57:11.750 --> 57:13.875
You should put that into your report.

57:20.166 --> 57:21.916
-[men shouting]
-[dog barking]

57:22.541 --> 57:23.833
[Mark] We'd better write 'em up.

57:24.416 --> 57:25.666
They can kiss England goodbye.

57:26.375 --> 57:28.041
[man] Dude, she was wearing her bedsheets.

57:28.125 --> 57:29.625
[Rial] This is what they want.

57:31.166 --> 57:33.541
-They like to see us crazy.
-[van engine starts]

57:34.250 --> 57:36.875
-Makes them feel like big men.
-[van drives off]

57:39.333 --> 57:43.708
They don't want to be reminded
that it is them that are weak.

57:44.666 --> 57:46.375
How poor...

57:47.000 --> 57:48.291
and lazy...

57:49.041 --> 57:51.333
and bored they are.

57:51.416 --> 57:52.458
Rial.

57:54.958 --> 57:56.541
Now, sorry.

57:58.583 --> 58:00.875
-Sorry, sorry, sorry...
-Rial.

58:04.500 --> 58:05.833
And you...

58:08.208 --> 58:09.750
You still idolize them.

58:13.666 --> 58:15.708
[laughing] You beg them.

58:16.541 --> 58:20.625
And then you thank them
for the unseasoned scraps they throw us.

58:23.125 --> 58:24.708
You eat them up.

58:32.666 --> 58:34.291
Let them send us back.

58:34.958 --> 58:36.666
But this is our home.

58:39.125 --> 58:40.708
We're going back.

58:42.458 --> 58:45.375
I'm leaving. With or without you.

58:46.541 --> 58:51.250
How quickly you forget everything
we went through to get here.

58:52.625 --> 58:55.541
How quickly you forget our daugh--

59:20.500 --> 59:21.791
You are sick.

59:29.083 --> 59:31.041
This is our home.

59:36.375 --> 59:38.208
You are not going anywhere.

59:59.541 --> 1:00:00.708
[thump]

1:00:17.416 --> 1:00:20.666
This time, you talk to me.

Where are you?

1:01:45.625 --> 1:01:47.416
[male voice, echoing] Thief.

1:01:48.958 --> 1:01:50.875

1:22:52.375 --> 1:22:54.541
Hello, Rial. Sorry to bother you.

1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:57.958
Uh, we work with Mark. May we come in?

1:23:00.541 --> 1:23:01.625
Come in.

[footsteps climbing stairs]

1:23:38.333 --> 1:23:40.000
[Mark] Is there still a witch?

1:23:40.916 --> 1:23:42.416
Rial killed it.

1:23:43.541 --> 1:23:45.041
[chuckles]

1:23:49.250 --> 1:23:51.916
I think I might paint this room red.

1:23:54.708 --> 1:23:55.791
Hm.

1:23:58.125 --> 1:23:59.875
Are you completely mad?

1:24:03.166 --> 1:24:04.583
What about the rats?

1:24:05.375 --> 1:24:09.041
-[shutter clicks]
-Perhaps I was being a little dramatic.

1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:15.375
Do you still see her?

1:24:16.791 --> 1:24:17.916
Nyagak?

1:24:23.541 --> 1:24:25.166
Your ghosts follow you.

1:24:26.166 --> 1:24:27.416
They never leave.

1:24:28.458 --> 1:24:30.416
They live with you.

1:24:32.833 --> 1:24:36.583
It's when I let them in,
I could start to face myself.

1:24:42.958 --> 1:24:44.666
This is our home.

1:24:47.333 --> 1:24:48.833
We are happy here.

1:24:52.791 --> 1:24:54.791
[man] They shouldn't be using a barbecue.

1:24:54.875 --> 1:24:57.375
[woman] And they shouldn't be
doing that to the walls.

1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:00.541
All right, then.

1:25:01.708 --> 1:25:02.708
That'd be all.

1:25:04.125 --> 1:25:05.333
[man] Right.

1:25:05.875 --> 1:25:07.916
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Majur.
