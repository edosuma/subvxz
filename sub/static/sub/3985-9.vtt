WEBVTT

00:08.537 --> 00:09.958
But it's a snail,
you see,

00:10.105 --> 00:12.666
and it go--
it go, "Meow."

00:14.178 --> 00:15.398
It's a what, now?
What?

00:15.546 --> 00:16.599
It meows.

00:16.747 --> 00:18.502
Then it ooze all up
SpongeBob's belly

00:18.649 --> 00:20.771
Iike it's his pet
and shit.

00:20.919 --> 00:24.943
Yo, y'all niggers watch
too many cartoons, I swear.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.711
Hey!

00:26.859 --> 00:29.614
Look, see, this is what's wrong with
the justice system right here.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.250
Niggers get locked up
and they don't stay that way.

00:31.398 --> 00:34.287
They make it hard to
take this shit serious.

00:34.434 --> 00:35.956
What, you snitchin'
or something?

00:36.105 --> 00:37.125
Shit no, man.

00:37.272 --> 00:38.593
You know they only
gave me, like, four, right?

00:38.741 --> 00:40.796
Know what I'm saying?
I done 15 months.

00:40.943 --> 00:42.998
So with good time, I'm like,
"Man, what the fuck?"

00:43.146 --> 00:44.133
Shit.

00:44.282 --> 00:45.701
Yeah, man.

00:45.850 --> 00:47.270
So...

00:47.418 --> 00:50.908
Yeah, man,
it ain't like it was, but it'll do.

00:51.056 --> 00:55.848
- So who we slinging for?
- Marlo Stanfield.

00:55.995 --> 00:58.251
- Come on, man!
- Yo, man, yeah.

00:58.399 --> 01:00.485
I was getting this nice
package from Slim Charles,

01:00.634 --> 01:02.955
but Marlo got the muscle
to hold us down,

01:03.104 --> 01:04.290
so that's where we at.

01:04.438 --> 01:07.127
Shit, one boss
same as the next, man.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.863
Make sure they ain't
sleepin', all right?

01:09.010 --> 01:10.599
Hey, yo, Little Kev,

01:10.746 --> 01:11.934
I told you about
the boy, Poot, right?

01:12.081 --> 01:13.369
Yeah.
Pussy hound.

01:13.517 --> 01:14.870
You just home?

01:15.019 --> 01:16.840
- How long in?
- 15 months.

01:16.988 --> 01:18.275
You got laid yet?

01:18.423 --> 01:20.244
Shit, I think
I already been burnt.

01:20.392 --> 01:22.417
Shit, I might need a ride
to the clinic today.

01:24.331 --> 01:26.719
I see ain't shit changed
around this joint.

01:26.866 --> 01:28.391
On the wall, gents.

01:29.805 --> 01:30.957
Make this easy
on all of us.

01:31.106 --> 01:33.828
Which one of youse
is Little Kevin?

01:33.977 --> 01:35.462
Come on, fellas.
It ain't no big deal.

01:35.610 --> 01:37.399
We just need some face time
with the motherfucker.

01:37.546 --> 01:40.902
Your name Kevin?

01:41.050 --> 01:41.937
No, this is, uh--

01:42.086 --> 01:43.806
Poot.
I'm Poot, yo.

01:43.954 --> 01:46.243
Poot, right, yeah. Didn't you
get locked up or shot or something?

01:46.390 --> 01:48.178
Society say l
deserve another chance.

01:48.327 --> 01:50.682
Yeah? Let's see. Which one of
these dickheads here is Little Kevin?

01:50.830 --> 01:53.184
- Man, I don't know no Kevin.
- Society can bite my dick.

01:53.332 --> 01:55.154
Come on, Bodie. I know this kid
works up here with you.

01:55.302 --> 01:57.089
- What's your name?
- Do I look little to you?

01:57.238 --> 02:00.193
All right. Fuck this. Everyone
under 150 lbs or 5'6" is in the cab.

02:00.342 --> 02:02.597
You, you, and you.

02:02.745 --> 02:04.610
And unless I see birth certificates
saying otherwise,

02:04.781 --> 02:05.667
you're my Little Kevins.

02:05.815 --> 02:09.080
And if that don't get it,
we're coming the fuck back.

02:14.225 --> 02:16.091
That's fucked up, yo.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.418
You got any
paper on you?

02:20.566 --> 02:22.255
Man, fuck if I know.

02:22.402 --> 02:25.191
These police out here knew how
to flip it even just a little,

02:25.339 --> 02:27.193
my shit would
be in handcuffs.

02:27.342 --> 02:28.309
You know?

02:29.377 --> 02:30.798
They don't know shit.

02:30.945 --> 02:32.276
Damn!

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:19.747 --> 04:21.612
You my ride?

04:24.052 --> 04:26.919
I'm your motherfucking
savior, is what I am.

04:28.723 --> 04:30.545
Told y'all Andre
was lying on me, yo.

04:30.693 --> 04:32.415
I didn't do it
for you.

04:32.562 --> 04:34.350
Fact is...

04:34.498 --> 04:36.820
if I could work back on
whatever cases I already caught,

04:36.967 --> 04:38.855
you might be going
right back inside.

04:39.003 --> 04:41.159
I know.

04:41.307 --> 04:42.927
So who did kill
that delivery girl?

04:43.075 --> 04:43.928
I don't know.

04:44.077 --> 04:45.097
Know it wasn't Andre.

04:45.245 --> 04:48.333
His blood don't run
that kind of cold.

04:48.482 --> 04:50.507
Who he getting his
package from?

04:52.454 --> 04:54.241
Saying I could go back
to the crib and bear up,

04:54.389 --> 04:56.044
find some things out
for you if you want me to--

04:56.191 --> 04:57.045
You owe me,
motherfucker.

04:57.193 --> 04:58.547
I'm saying
I know I do, man.

04:58.695 --> 05:00.649
And if you want to pay down
any part of this debt,

05:00.797 --> 05:02.484
you know what you
gotta do for me?

05:02.632 --> 05:04.624
No more bodies.

05:07.204 --> 05:08.792
No more fucking
bodies from you.

05:08.940 --> 05:13.064
No more comebacks
or get-evens on this.

05:13.212 --> 05:14.544
No more killing.

05:18.253 --> 05:20.187
You owe me your word.

05:23.825 --> 05:25.313
All right, man.

05:25.462 --> 05:27.020
No bodies on me.

05:33.204 --> 05:34.624
You really want
to ease my mind,

05:34.772 --> 05:36.426
you'll let me drive you
down to Aberdeen rail station,

05:36.574 --> 05:37.994
put you on a
northbound train.

05:38.143 --> 05:39.497
Naw, man.

05:39.645 --> 05:41.432
Baltimore's all I know.

05:41.581 --> 05:43.208
You know what
it is like, homey.

05:45.052 --> 05:46.917
Man gotta live what
he know, right?

05:49.958 --> 05:51.044
You're absolutely right.

05:51.192 --> 05:53.080
There are many significant
factors to consider,

05:53.229 --> 05:54.382
but getting
crime under control

05:54.530 --> 05:56.417
is key to sparking
investment here,

05:56.566 --> 05:59.389
- jump-starting growth.
- If you make it safe, they will come.

05:59.536 --> 06:01.992
Well, I hate to begin our beautiful
relationship with my hand out,

06:02.140 --> 06:05.429
but I'm told that two federal grants
to my office dry up this year.

06:05.577 --> 06:07.331
That's right.
Come the first of the year,

06:07.479 --> 06:09.934
those DOJ grants evaporate,
and you're out 1 2 prosecutors.

06:10.082 --> 06:11.370
Well, I was hoping you'd
be able to absorb that

06:11.517 --> 06:12.404
in the general fund,

06:12.551 --> 06:14.239
maybe even throw in
a little bit more,

06:14.387 --> 06:16.776
make it competitive with the PD
and Attorney General's jobs--

06:16.923 --> 06:19.280
starts the turnover.
It's killing us.

06:19.427 --> 06:21.649
This would be the time to do it.
I mean, we're over the revenue

06:21.797 --> 06:23.752
expected for this point
in the fiscal year

06:23.900 --> 06:25.253
next to the
real estate market.

06:25.401 --> 06:27.156
How much past? 'Cause l
want to come out of the box

06:27.303 --> 06:28.457
with a big bump
in police salaries,

06:28.605 --> 06:30.092
in particular the
commissioner's salary,

06:30.241 --> 06:31.727
which needs to jump,
like, 50 grand.

06:31.876 --> 06:35.132
Well, a good guess would be a
one-shot surplus of about 20 million.

06:35.281 --> 06:37.402
But that's rainy-day money
for more than crime.

06:37.550 --> 06:39.738
Word around North Avenue is that
the schools are running a deficit.

06:39.885 --> 06:42.908
Excuse me. Did you say a
50,000 bump for Ervin Burrell?

06:43.055 --> 06:44.443
Well, no, not
for Burrell per se.

06:44.591 --> 06:46.213
Oh, for the next police
commissioner, then.

06:46.361 --> 06:48.248
- That's what you mean?
- Well, looking ahead, it makes sense.

06:48.396 --> 06:50.550
Because firing Burrell would
upset a good-sized block

06:50.699 --> 06:53.321
of my constituency, not
to mention the ministers.

06:53.470 --> 06:55.190
And I think the budget chair
might have a difficult time

06:55.338 --> 06:57.594
allowing a higher salary
to be approved.

06:57.741 --> 07:00.597
In fact, I can guarantee if
that proposal's in the budget--

07:00.746 --> 07:02.633
your first, for the record--

07:02.781 --> 07:04.836
the bill won't come out
of committee intact.

07:04.983 --> 07:07.172
I'm just saying that in
the event Commissioner Burrell

07:07.320 --> 07:09.308
were to leave, we'd want
to bump that salary

07:09.456 --> 07:11.377
in order to attract
the best candidates,

07:11.525 --> 07:13.145
in particular the best
African-American candidates

07:13.294 --> 07:14.581
from across the nation.

07:14.729 --> 07:17.561
With three years left in his term,
why would he leave?

07:18.901 --> 07:21.089
Councilman, what may not have
been obvious to you

07:21.237 --> 07:22.757
on the Public Safety
Subcommittee

07:22.905 --> 07:26.362
is that the budget process
is a carefully orchestrated ballet,

07:26.510 --> 07:29.766
a cooperative effort between
the branches of government.

07:29.914 --> 07:30.934
Well, Madam President,

07:31.082 --> 07:32.702
the nuances of that
cooperative effort

07:32.851 --> 07:35.115
are beginning to come
into focus for me.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.267
Thank you, Madam President.

07:52.775 --> 07:53.962
Come on in, everyone.

07:54.111 --> 07:55.031
Don't wait by the door.

07:55.179 --> 07:57.433
Duquan, you're here.

07:57.582 --> 07:59.836
Randy, you're here.

07:59.984 --> 08:00.871
No, you two switch.

08:01.020 --> 08:03.074
Calvin, you're here
in the front.

08:03.222 --> 08:04.375
Quenice, you're here.

08:04.523 --> 08:05.943
Michael, you're here.

08:06.092 --> 08:07.211
Destiny, here.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.182
Myesha, here.

08:09.329 --> 08:10.483
Dashonda, here.

08:10.630 --> 08:12.585
Come on, keep moving.
Don't stop at the door.

08:12.733 --> 08:14.702
Come in.
Let's get started.

08:25.448 --> 08:28.171
Could be a problem.

08:28.319 --> 08:29.238
How so?

08:29.387 --> 08:30.674
Your boy been assigned to

08:30.822 --> 08:33.610
- what they call the Major Crimes Unit.
- Meaning what?

08:33.759 --> 08:36.414
They the motherfuckers that did
the last three city wiretaps--

08:36.563 --> 08:38.650
one where they bugged
Barksdale's office,

08:38.799 --> 08:41.486
another where they hit
Kentel up in Park Heights.

08:41.635 --> 08:43.457
And the last one-- shit.

08:43.605 --> 08:46.427
They was all up on
Stringer Bell's cell phone.

08:46.576 --> 08:48.263
You ain't still using
burners, is you?

08:48.410 --> 08:49.932
I'm dumping them
every two weeks.

08:50.080 --> 08:53.603
Not good enough.
You read that.

08:53.751 --> 08:56.841
You'll see that Stringer was changing
his number every damn day

08:56.989 --> 09:00.611
and they still pulled the motherfucker's
voice off a goddamn cell phone tower.

09:00.759 --> 09:01.988
City police did that?

09:06.199 --> 09:07.586
Where'd you get this?

09:07.735 --> 09:10.256
Courthouse clerk's office.

09:10.404 --> 09:12.393
Hey, the shit's
open to the public

09:12.541 --> 09:15.697
after they finish
prosecuting your ass.

09:15.845 --> 09:18.100
You need to lose
them cell phones, son.

09:18.247 --> 09:22.379
Me-- I ain't as so much as
touched a burner in a year.

09:46.316 --> 09:49.037
5'9" and 3/8?

09:49.186 --> 09:50.338
You got it.

09:50.487 --> 09:51.374
Now, hold the measure

09:51.522 --> 09:53.911
and spread your
arms out to the side.

09:54.059 --> 09:55.413
What you got?

09:55.560 --> 09:56.781
I want one.

09:56.928 --> 09:58.216
So, your cat can eat 'em?

09:58.364 --> 09:59.661
So, how'd you find them?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.299
I'm going to
the calculators.

10:07.141 --> 10:08.160
Give me that.

10:08.309 --> 10:09.196
Give it here.

10:09.344 --> 10:10.564
The same.

10:10.712 --> 10:14.101
Your height and your
arm span-- identical.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.703
Quenice?

10:15.852 --> 10:17.506
See, look. You about
to get me in trouble.

10:17.654 --> 10:19.775
So, you say you
like to box, right?

10:19.924 --> 10:22.146
You must have some
kind of reach.

10:22.293 --> 10:23.481
Everything cheap
on computers

10:23.628 --> 10:24.782
if you know where
to look for it.

10:24.930 --> 10:28.286
Yo, this mean the price
I'm getting from the Koreans,

10:28.434 --> 10:29.754
yo, they still
marking it up some.

10:29.902 --> 10:31.089
They gotta be.

10:31.238 --> 10:32.925
I can make twice
as much using this here.

10:33.073 --> 10:35.462
Uh-uh.

10:35.610 --> 10:36.599
Can't.

10:42.284 --> 10:44.472
All this along the lower
Patapsco/Westport area

10:44.620 --> 10:45.708
is ready for a turn.

10:45.855 --> 10:47.977
The proximity to downtown
and the B.W. Parkway

10:48.125 --> 10:50.747
make it ideal for Washington
commuters. That's a given.

10:50.895 --> 10:53.251
- Anything to speed it up?
- A harbor promenade could work,

10:53.398 --> 10:55.051
going west from both
sides of the bridge.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.522
The South Harbor Promenade,
brought to you by--

10:57.671 --> 10:59.057
Mayor Thomas Carcetti--

10:59.205 --> 11:00.692
and the citizens
of Baltimore.

11:00.841 --> 11:02.294
Doesn't quite have
the same ring

11:02.443 --> 11:04.265
as a stadium or
an aquarium expansion,

11:04.412 --> 11:05.833
- does it?
- It's a start.

11:05.981 --> 11:08.036
Further east, you've got
the Locust Point Marine Terminal,

11:08.183 --> 11:10.405
which, unfortunately,
is still a working enterprise,

11:10.553 --> 11:12.574
and the further you go
into Brooklyn/Curtis Bay,

11:12.723 --> 11:14.243
the more
the skyline disappears.

11:14.391 --> 11:15.711
We lose
the Washington crowd.

11:15.860 --> 11:17.345
For that part of
the waterfront,

11:17.494 --> 11:19.248
- you're gonna need a different draw.
- Casinos?

11:19.396 --> 11:21.117
Oh, the urban planning
default? I don't want to see

11:21.266 --> 11:22.754
the kind of crime
that comes with casinos.

11:22.901 --> 11:24.055
Tax base is tax base.

11:24.202 --> 11:25.557
This is where
I get off the boat.

11:25.705 --> 11:27.725
It's one thing to sell
waterfront for tax base,

11:27.874 --> 11:30.496
but now you're just sucking
paychecks out of my community.

11:30.645 --> 11:32.464
Well, it was just a thought.
And, anyway,

11:32.613 --> 11:34.134
we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

11:34.282 --> 11:36.304
This is just the first
long meeting of many.

11:36.452 --> 11:40.082
So, thanks to everyone,
and we'll continue this later.

11:45.697 --> 11:48.786
Madam President,
a word with you?

11:48.934 --> 11:50.129
Do you have a minute?

11:52.170 --> 11:54.104
You and me, we got
a problem already?

11:55.508 --> 11:57.930
Just trying to help guide
you through the process,

11:58.077 --> 12:02.069
Mr. Mayor... -Elect.

12:02.216 --> 12:03.270
Felt more like you
were dragging me

12:03.418 --> 12:05.540
across a minefield,
Nerese.

12:05.687 --> 12:07.307
- Why you so pissed off at me?
- Look.

12:07.456 --> 12:10.144
Clarence shouldn't have run again
for any number of reasons.

12:10.293 --> 12:12.815
I was ready to step up,
and the deal was cut long ago

12:12.963 --> 12:14.216
that he'd back me
when the time came.

12:14.365 --> 12:17.654
You and Tony--
you guys jumped the line.

12:17.803 --> 12:18.955
It wasn't your turn.

12:19.104 --> 12:20.926
Oh, whoa. Whoa.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.396
First of all, I'm sorry if Tony
and I ruined your party plans,

12:23.543 --> 12:26.031
but I wasn't privy to whatever
you and Clarence cooked up.

12:26.178 --> 12:30.536
That aside, I was kind of looking
forward to working closely together.

12:30.684 --> 12:32.640
I think that we could
make things happen.

12:32.787 --> 12:36.611
You're only getting
the one term, Tommy.

12:36.759 --> 12:38.380
I'm not gonna stand
down next time.

12:38.528 --> 12:40.483
What makes you think I'll even
be around that long?

12:40.630 --> 12:41.951
Governor's race
is in two years,

12:42.099 --> 12:44.154
and plans can change.

12:44.301 --> 12:45.922
You might find yourself
mayor in 2008

12:46.070 --> 12:48.301
without so much as
a campaign speech.

13:02.223 --> 13:04.145
Wasn't easy
tracking you down.

13:04.293 --> 13:06.681
The numbers I got for
you don't work no more.

13:06.830 --> 13:07.783
I see you got
a problem.

13:07.931 --> 13:10.520
Looking rough, Bubs.

13:10.668 --> 13:12.387
I been keeping
it clean, you know...

13:12.536 --> 13:14.157
pushing my carts and all.

13:14.306 --> 13:16.226
But this one young man--
every time I cross him,

13:16.374 --> 13:18.028
I get tossed
for what I got on me.

13:18.177 --> 13:19.898
Cash, pills.

13:20.046 --> 13:22.968
I mean, he look on me
like an ATM or some shit, I swear.

13:23.116 --> 13:24.837
I'm ready to work, Kima.

13:24.986 --> 13:27.139
Get this motherfucker off me,
I'll do what you need.

13:27.288 --> 13:29.242
Look at me, Bubs.
I ain't in Narco.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.813
Yeah, I see.
You look nice.

13:31.961 --> 13:33.215
I'm working homicides.

13:33.362 --> 13:34.515
So, if the bad boy
happen to kill me,

13:34.662 --> 13:35.857
you can help me out then,
right?

13:40.438 --> 13:41.491
If we drive around a bit,

13:41.639 --> 13:43.293
you think you can put
eyes on this motherfucker?

13:43.441 --> 13:44.327
I can try.

13:44.476 --> 13:45.704
Get in.

13:49.983 --> 13:52.004
So, Nerese is
bucking already.

13:52.151 --> 13:53.238
Feels like if
the mayor's chair

13:53.387 --> 13:55.308
ain't gonna go to Royce,
it should be hers.

13:55.457 --> 13:56.976
Problem is she's gonna
see any proposal

13:57.125 --> 13:58.479
to raise
the commissioner's salary

13:58.627 --> 14:00.482
- as a move against Burrell.
- Which it is.

14:00.630 --> 14:01.950
We can't raise the salary,

14:02.098 --> 14:03.419
we can't attract strong
minority candidates.

14:03.566 --> 14:04.486
No strong candidates,

14:04.635 --> 14:06.689
we can't get rid
of the guy we got.

14:06.838 --> 14:09.825
Fuck if I'm gonna live with
Burrell as my commissioner.

14:09.973 --> 14:11.528
What if he quits?

14:11.675 --> 14:12.863
Quits?

14:13.010 --> 14:15.799
Maybe the man can be shamed.
If he leaves on his own account,

14:15.948 --> 14:19.577
that takes us off the hook
with Nerese and the ministers, right?

14:20.921 --> 14:23.243
No. I mean, we don't want
your credit card number.

14:23.390 --> 14:24.744
I mean, we won't
even know the number.

14:24.892 --> 14:27.681
We just need you
to order the candy.

14:27.829 --> 14:29.183
And you have cash
up front?

14:29.331 --> 14:31.252
He pay you back, Mr. P.
When he sell off, man,

14:31.401 --> 14:32.287
he gonna pay you back.

14:32.435 --> 14:34.022
Yeah.

14:34.171 --> 14:36.225
Points on the
package, huh?

14:36.373 --> 14:37.226
No way.

14:37.374 --> 14:38.662
Aw, come on, Mr. Pryzbo.

14:38.810 --> 14:41.733
I mean, doesn't it teach us
math? Addition, subtraction,

14:41.880 --> 14:43.734
uh, a quarter,
a quarter of a dollar,

14:43.882 --> 14:46.270
a dime, a tenth,
you know?

14:46.419 --> 14:47.977
No cash, no card.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.777
All right. Fine.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.413
Cash up front.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.282
No problem.

14:55.430 --> 14:58.519
And if you come in with
a wad of bills tomorrow, Randy,

14:58.667 --> 15:00.189
I want to know where
they came from.

15:00.336 --> 15:02.791
I don't want either
of you out on the corner.

15:02.939 --> 15:03.928
All right.

15:06.443 --> 15:09.400
Ms. Thiessen, you okay?

15:09.547 --> 15:11.503
Hey, uh...

15:11.650 --> 15:13.209
I think my car's
been stolen.

15:20.259 --> 15:21.848
Yeah, man.
All right...

15:21.996 --> 15:23.683
so what I'm saying
is that you got from

15:23.832 --> 15:26.453
Bentlow down there to
Rosewood right here.

15:26.602 --> 15:27.454
All right?

15:27.603 --> 15:28.790
Now, I got the block
from Monroe

15:28.938 --> 15:30.158
all the way down
to Pacer,

15:30.306 --> 15:31.459
so I got you covered
from that side,

15:31.608 --> 15:33.329
but you gotta put lookouts
in Franklintown to catch anybody

15:33.477 --> 15:35.765
- coming from the other way.
- All right, I got you.

15:35.912 --> 15:37.902
- Are you ready to work?
- Yeah, just get my re-up.

15:38.049 --> 15:39.669
We'll go on about
the shit for real.

15:39.818 --> 15:42.982
- No, are you ready to work?
- Yeah. Ready to work.

15:45.025 --> 15:48.281
- Donut, go talk to Little Kevin for me.
- All right. Watch the ride.

15:48.429 --> 15:52.552
Hey, yo, look. Man, please do not be
having your mama come talk for you.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.153
Man, I ain't have
her do nothing.

15:54.302 --> 15:56.323
She just get on her horse
and come with it.

15:56.471 --> 15:58.827
Look. I done did everything
I can for you and yours,

15:58.975 --> 16:03.936
but from here on, your moms
can't do nothing to help. All right?

16:07.786 --> 16:09.107
Him?

16:09.254 --> 16:11.409
From Wee-Bey?

16:11.557 --> 16:13.116
Your moms?

16:23.372 --> 16:25.826
No sign of
the motherfucker Andre.

16:25.974 --> 16:28.597
Store been padlocked a week.

16:28.744 --> 16:30.799
Ain't even calling
for his re-up.

16:30.947 --> 16:33.036
Huh.

16:33.183 --> 16:35.271
Check the man at the jail?

16:35.420 --> 16:36.906
Yeah.

16:37.055 --> 16:39.343
People say Omar ain't even been
on the tier for two weeks,

16:39.492 --> 16:40.812
so he either
staying someplace

16:40.960 --> 16:43.148
or they got him
at county lock-up.

16:43.297 --> 16:44.958
Or the charges
been dropped.

16:46.567 --> 16:47.853
If this
cocksucker's sprung,

16:48.002 --> 16:50.624
my man is backing
up on his story.

16:50.772 --> 16:53.071
Mean he could
back up on y'all.

16:54.611 --> 16:56.100
I'm on it.

16:59.548 --> 17:01.103
How about
the New York boys?

17:01.251 --> 17:02.772
We dropped five of them.

17:02.919 --> 17:04.441
The rest went to ground.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.009
Drive through East Baltimore,

17:06.156 --> 17:09.647
you don't even see
a Baltimore nigger with a Yankee cap.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.126
Want us to stay
on that, too?

17:12.632 --> 17:14.618
I talked to the fat man,

17:14.768 --> 17:16.463
but I think
we're done there.

17:18.272 --> 17:21.140
This shit with Andre--
job one.

17:31.222 --> 17:32.109
No.

17:32.257 --> 17:33.343
We could try
the avenue again.

17:33.490 --> 17:34.811
He be behind
the market sometimes.

17:34.959 --> 17:36.414
Look, Bubs, I ain't
got all fucking day.

17:36.561 --> 17:37.682
I'm on shift work now.

17:37.830 --> 17:38.916
I'm working murders.

17:39.064 --> 17:40.753
He banked me four times
this week, Kima.

17:40.901 --> 17:43.022
I'm having dreams about this
low-bottom motherfucker.

17:43.170 --> 17:44.490
All right.
I tell you what--

17:44.639 --> 17:45.925
you want to work?

17:46.072 --> 17:48.895
I'll call Sydnor or Herc
down at Major Crimes,

17:49.044 --> 17:50.965
put you with someone
doing drug work.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.635
You work for them, they'll
help you with your problem.

17:53.783 --> 17:54.669
All right?

17:54.817 --> 17:55.838
I need this now, Kima.

17:55.986 --> 17:57.140
I'll tell them that.

17:57.288 --> 17:58.441
Woman--

17:58.589 --> 17:59.610
So show me where
you're living,

17:59.757 --> 18:01.316
and I'll tell them
where they can find you.

18:02.828 --> 18:03.817
Make the left.

18:13.874 --> 18:15.662
I don't understand.

18:15.810 --> 18:17.971
You told the man you not
gonna kill no one.

18:19.615 --> 18:21.480
I gave my word on that.

18:22.718 --> 18:24.873
Fuck we doing
back here then, Papa?

18:25.021 --> 18:28.478
I can still put a gun
in Andre's face, right?

18:28.626 --> 18:30.924
That man got some
explaining to do.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.221
It's dead out here, yo.

18:36.369 --> 18:38.132
Tip on out.

18:48.985 --> 18:51.072
I don't know why he don't
trust us with it, yo.

18:51.220 --> 18:53.416
I mean, we trustworthy,
ain't we?

18:55.359 --> 18:58.420
Just gotta get enough for the first
order. Then we're good.

19:06.606 --> 19:08.293
All right!
Hard six!

19:08.442 --> 19:09.807
Come on, trey!

19:11.812 --> 19:13.267
I'm in.

19:13.414 --> 19:14.575
Go away, boy.

19:17.152 --> 19:18.038
Oh, you in?

19:18.187 --> 19:19.073
Yeah.

19:19.221 --> 19:20.450
Pass line for me, yo.

19:22.859 --> 19:24.914
Oh, shit!

19:25.061 --> 19:28.184
Yeah. Get that money.
Get that money, shorty.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.062
Get that money.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.767
I heard tell of it,
but I didn't believe it.

19:40.915 --> 19:41.802
All this overtime,

19:41.949 --> 19:44.372
all for two cases
as a secondary.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.439
First the names are red,

19:45.588 --> 19:46.775
then they're green,

19:46.923 --> 19:48.009
then they're black.

19:48.158 --> 19:49.312
And that doesn't
even include the court pay

19:49.459 --> 19:52.147
you make if the soft
case goes to trial.

19:52.295 --> 19:53.649
Sweet.

19:53.798 --> 19:57.188
So, what you gonna do
with yours, Detective Greggs, huh?

19:57.335 --> 19:58.530
Pay down some debt.

20:07.180 --> 20:09.803
- Why you leaving?
- Your luck ain't gonna change.

20:09.950 --> 20:11.205
Don't worry
about that, man.

20:11.353 --> 20:12.806
Yo, thanks for
walking us off.

20:12.955 --> 20:15.510
I thought we was
gonna get banked.

20:15.658 --> 20:16.946
You ain't gonna
bank us, is you?

20:17.094 --> 20:18.380
Shit, boy.

20:18.528 --> 20:20.183
You think I'm
that ungrateful?

20:20.330 --> 20:22.052
I followed you
through 10 shooters

20:22.200 --> 20:24.430
and made more money
that I have in a month.

20:25.503 --> 20:27.891
Nah.
I ain't gonna rob you.

20:28.040 --> 20:31.096
I just need to know next time
you fade a dice game. You feel?

20:31.243 --> 20:33.031
I mean, it's all about
the math, you know,

20:33.179 --> 20:34.466
the probabilities and all.

20:34.614 --> 20:36.469
I ain't never seen
you in a game before.

20:36.617 --> 20:37.937
Where you learn
your game?

20:38.085 --> 20:39.038
Edward Tilghman Middle.

20:39.186 --> 20:40.608
Shit.

20:40.755 --> 20:42.109
All we got
is Little Kevin.

20:42.257 --> 20:44.980
Oh, Bodie's boy, huh?

20:45.128 --> 20:47.927
What'd I tell you? Bubs gets
it the first time. Here.

20:51.168 --> 20:53.757
Y'all meet up with me
in the afternoon tomorrow--

20:53.905 --> 20:54.891
after school lets out--

20:55.040 --> 20:57.162
and I'll give
Kevin a new hat.

20:57.309 --> 20:59.897
A hat trick?
Cool.

21:00.045 --> 21:01.132
Yo, Herc, man?

21:01.281 --> 21:02.667
What's up?

21:02.816 --> 21:04.536
It's not about
the money this time.

21:04.684 --> 21:06.640
He breaking me every day
unless I give him something.

21:06.787 --> 21:09.143
I can't-- I can't
take it anymore, man.

21:09.290 --> 21:10.511
Once we're done
with Kevin,

21:10.658 --> 21:11.979
you go find this asshole,

21:12.127 --> 21:13.849
hit my cell phone.

21:13.996 --> 21:15.784
I'll be on him
five minutes later.

21:15.932 --> 21:17.264
I promise.

21:22.907 --> 21:26.064
Then you add this, yo,
and watch it fizzle.

21:26.212 --> 21:27.299
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

21:27.447 --> 21:28.601
Not so much.
Not so much.

21:28.748 --> 21:30.649
You gonna make it spill
everywhere, you see?

21:33.553 --> 21:35.341
What are you
still doing here?

21:35.490 --> 21:37.144
Ain't nobody
want you here.

21:37.291 --> 21:38.345
Your mama want me.

21:38.493 --> 21:40.281
Yeah.
You and the pipe.

21:40.428 --> 21:43.318
Shouldn't talk about your
mama like that, Michael.

21:43.466 --> 21:46.766
- Hey, Daddy, see my volcano?
- Bug, go upstairs.

21:48.172 --> 21:49.366
Bug need me, too.

21:51.375 --> 21:53.230
Saturday, right?

21:53.377 --> 21:54.432
Bug need me.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.702
My teachers say
I gotta need glasses.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.503
I gotta have
an adult with me.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.808
Pick 'em up.
Sign for 'em.

22:01.956 --> 22:03.788
Bug, go upstairs
to your room.

22:07.428 --> 22:11.319
Ice cold, boy.
Where you be?

22:11.467 --> 22:14.223
Ain't got a forgiveness
to your soul.

22:14.370 --> 22:16.058
Man, fuck you.

22:16.206 --> 22:17.928
Watch your mouth.

22:18.075 --> 22:21.898
You're big,
but not big enough.

22:22.047 --> 22:23.568
Now...

22:23.716 --> 22:25.370
where's that D.S.S. card?

22:25.519 --> 22:26.671
Your mama said
that come to me.

22:26.820 --> 22:29.015
Ain't nothing left
on this month's check anyway.

22:31.626 --> 22:33.959
Before the first
of the month, then.

22:56.422 --> 22:59.845
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:59.993 --> 23:01.359
Uh, come on in.

23:11.174 --> 23:14.631
I see the little man done
took over the living room.

23:14.779 --> 23:15.865
Good for him.

23:16.012 --> 23:17.867
Well, you know how it goes.

23:18.015 --> 23:20.737
Well, I'm just
messing with you.

23:20.886 --> 23:22.040
Place looks great.

23:22.187 --> 23:25.316
Even the toys look
like they belong.

23:26.926 --> 23:27.913
This is...

23:28.062 --> 23:29.782
this month and
two going back.

23:29.931 --> 23:31.952
I'm just trying
to catch up.

23:32.100 --> 23:35.122
I appreciate you not
coming after me for it.

23:35.271 --> 23:37.091
Knocking over
liquor stores now?

23:37.239 --> 23:39.594
Overtime from Homicide.

23:39.743 --> 23:40.897
It stays like this,

23:41.044 --> 23:43.767
and I won't have a problem
coming up with my share.

23:43.915 --> 23:44.901
Kima--

23:45.049 --> 23:46.571
this ain't,
"Please take me back,"

23:46.719 --> 23:50.176
but a deal's a deal,
right?

23:51.222 --> 23:53.978
Hey, I'm home.

23:54.127 --> 23:56.248
Hey, Elijah.

23:56.396 --> 23:57.550
Hey.

23:57.697 --> 24:01.254
Um, Kima, this is
Nancine Owens.

24:01.403 --> 24:04.058
Sorry.
The place is a mess.

24:04.206 --> 24:05.727
You could stay for dinner,

24:05.875 --> 24:08.898
but tonight we have
people coming over.

24:09.045 --> 24:10.933
It's a kind of
a celebration, actually.

24:11.081 --> 24:12.134
Yeah?

24:12.282 --> 24:13.403
I passed the bar
this week.

24:13.551 --> 24:15.372
Huh.
Congratulations.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.376
Most of the gals I work with
have a problem with that.

24:18.524 --> 24:19.410
With what?

24:19.559 --> 24:20.991
Passing the bar.

24:24.197 --> 24:25.651
Well, guess
I better be going.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.821
Thanks for coming past.

24:27.968 --> 24:29.089
Let's make bed...

24:29.236 --> 24:30.123
Yeah.

24:30.271 --> 24:31.792
Nice meeting you.

24:31.939 --> 24:33.261
- Elijah?
- Huh?

24:33.409 --> 24:34.462
Say bye to Aunt Kima.

24:34.611 --> 24:35.736
Bye.

24:38.082 --> 24:39.071
Uh-oh.

25:00.542 --> 25:01.430
Where's Dre?

25:01.578 --> 25:02.431
I don't know!

25:02.580 --> 25:04.376
You believe her?
No.

25:07.951 --> 25:09.839
One last time.
Where's Andre?

25:09.986 --> 25:13.176
He-- he said if he told
me where he was going,

25:13.325 --> 25:15.413
I'd have to tell you.

25:15.561 --> 25:17.082
I don't know.
I don't know.

25:17.229 --> 25:19.451
You believe her now?

25:19.599 --> 25:21.568
Yeah.

25:30.313 --> 25:32.867
Dang.
Sure is quiet this early.

25:33.014 --> 25:35.670
Yo, you gonna come
with me to see Mr. P?

25:35.818 --> 25:37.506
No, go on up. I'll see you
in homeroom.

25:37.654 --> 25:39.281
All right.

25:45.231 --> 25:46.651
Mr. P.

25:46.799 --> 25:48.487
Randy.

25:48.635 --> 25:50.255
Randy, how did you--

25:50.403 --> 25:51.523
six beats four
or five.

25:51.672 --> 25:54.094
And most times eight is better
than 10. Right?

25:54.242 --> 25:55.629
You schooled me good.

25:55.778 --> 25:57.832
- You gambled for this? I didn't even
- Pick up the dice.

25:57.980 --> 26:00.135
I was all, "Pass,
no pass."

26:00.283 --> 26:02.571
Got to the point where some
of them was following me in there.

26:02.719 --> 26:03.805
You shouldn't gamble.

26:03.954 --> 26:06.476
I know, but I'm just saying,
the math be right, Mr. P.

26:06.624 --> 26:08.378
But I'm gonna
come back at lunch,

26:08.525 --> 26:11.553
and we can computer up
that candy, all right? Peace.

26:17.236 --> 26:18.590
Resign?

26:18.739 --> 26:20.893
Either that or the day-to-day
running of the department

26:21.041 --> 26:23.704
falls to the Deputy Commissioner
for Operations.

26:25.614 --> 26:28.469
Erv, I have made no secret
of wanting to make changes.

26:28.617 --> 26:32.274
Oh, so Bill Rawls is now
the voice of reform, is he?

26:32.422 --> 26:33.375
This isn't about Rawls.

26:33.524 --> 26:35.745
I have no faith in you,
given recent events.

26:35.894 --> 26:38.749
I know you remember the two of us
sitting in this same booth

26:38.897 --> 26:40.018
a year ago, you
telling me about

26:40.165 --> 26:41.785
how you respect
the chain of command.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.721
Well, respect it now.

26:43.869 --> 26:47.325
Every department head serves
at the pleasure of the mayor.

26:47.473 --> 26:50.496
So, if you're
firing me, Mr. Mayor,

26:50.644 --> 26:53.399
I want you to know
I will go quietly.

26:53.548 --> 26:55.469
You'll tender your
letter of resignation?

26:55.617 --> 26:56.638
Oh, no.

26:56.786 --> 26:58.907
I'm not offering
to resign.

26:59.055 --> 27:01.677
If you want me to go, you're
gonna have to shitcan me.

27:01.825 --> 27:05.882
A small distinction,
I know, but...

27:06.030 --> 27:07.752
in the meantime,

27:07.899 --> 27:10.755
since you have Bill Rawls
doing my job for me,

27:10.903 --> 27:12.957
and it's such
a nice day out,

27:13.106 --> 27:17.930
I think I'll go to
Forest Park and shoot nine.

27:18.078 --> 27:20.137
The check is yours,
I think.

27:25.354 --> 27:27.442
Pick a table, any table.

27:27.590 --> 27:31.413
Eiffel Tower, Big Ben,
Empire State Building.

27:31.562 --> 27:32.749
Your table is your team.

27:32.897 --> 27:35.419
The team that puts its
model together first wins.

27:35.566 --> 27:38.256
Now, you say y'all can work
together out on the corner.

27:38.403 --> 27:39.758
Let's see how
you do on this.

27:39.906 --> 27:41.426
Wins what?

27:41.575 --> 27:44.497
Big fat gold stars
and some shit.

27:44.645 --> 27:48.068
Dinner downtown. Any restaurant
you can agree on.

27:48.216 --> 27:49.903
Since y'all only
seem willing to be

27:50.051 --> 27:51.638
interested in stuff you know,

27:51.786 --> 27:53.241
we looked for things
more like Baltimore.

27:53.388 --> 27:55.676
The scale model of the
Fayette Street stash house

27:55.824 --> 27:57.312
was all sold out.

27:57.459 --> 27:59.816
So, y'all just gonna
have to make do.

27:59.963 --> 28:02.719
Hey, um, Mr. Colvin, the box say there's
supposed to be some instructions.

28:02.867 --> 28:05.256
We took those out. Makes it
more interesting, don't you think?

28:05.403 --> 28:08.932
Yeah, it ain't like we follow
instructions anywhere else, right?

28:11.911 --> 28:14.534
And I ain't even want to
put no charges on no more.

28:14.682 --> 28:16.270
But see, they made me
do that,

28:16.417 --> 28:19.540
and now they're gonna be mad
at me 'cause it ain't stick.

28:19.689 --> 28:21.108
Who be "they"?

28:21.257 --> 28:22.877
People I'm getting
the package from.

28:23.025 --> 28:25.146
I'm asking who.

28:25.294 --> 28:26.447
Boy named Marlo.

28:26.595 --> 28:29.952
He's big on the West Side.
You heard of him?

28:30.100 --> 28:31.420
Vaguely recall the name.

28:31.569 --> 28:32.923
So, I just need to
chill for a while

28:33.070 --> 28:34.392
till they remember
how to forget.

28:34.539 --> 28:36.159
So, now you come
over East Side

28:36.308 --> 28:38.777
and expect me
to hide you.

28:40.046 --> 28:41.767
Why is it that every
Baltimore nigger think

28:41.916 --> 28:44.137
that running the fuck away
means crossing downtown?

28:44.285 --> 28:47.575
Shit, you ought to be in New York
or Philly or some shit.

28:47.723 --> 28:51.513
No, see, I know that. It's just that
I don't know no one outside of B'more.

28:51.661 --> 28:56.017
And I was just hoping, let's say,
trade out my store, you could maybe

28:56.166 --> 28:59.088
front me some cash, get me
out of town with people you know.

28:59.236 --> 29:00.990
I mean, I'd come to
the East Side to you,

29:01.139 --> 29:03.630
but too many West Side
motherfuckers are with Marlo.

29:06.378 --> 29:09.702
You know what the problem
with these here machines?

29:09.849 --> 29:11.136
They too cheap
to begin with.

29:11.284 --> 29:13.205
Some people would think
for what it's worth

29:13.354 --> 29:15.508
to fix it and make
the shit work right,

29:15.656 --> 29:18.922
you might as well dump
them and get another.

29:23.133 --> 29:24.820
2,000 and a free ride north

29:24.969 --> 29:26.723
for the store
and its contents.

29:26.871 --> 29:28.492
Store worth way more, Joe.

29:28.639 --> 29:30.699
It depends, don't it?

29:38.584 --> 29:41.179
No, it goes on
the other side and shit.

29:44.926 --> 29:46.648
Stop fucking fronting me.
I want to do something.

29:46.795 --> 29:48.181
You gonna curse at me again,
I'm gonna cut you.

29:48.330 --> 29:49.751
Get that shit
out my face.

29:49.899 --> 29:51.787
I don't even want to
do this shit no more.

29:51.934 --> 29:54.056
That's how you
always do it.

29:54.205 --> 29:55.825
What are you doing?
Look at the box.

29:55.972 --> 29:57.227
Do that look like
that's on the box?

29:57.375 --> 29:59.429
I can't do this.

29:59.578 --> 30:02.067
Nigger, come on, now.
I'm trying to eat.

30:02.214 --> 30:04.136
- Give me that piece, yo.
- Fuck you, yo,

30:04.284 --> 30:05.637
because you don't even
know what you're doing.

30:05.785 --> 30:08.040
Just sit there and shut up
because you just don't know.

30:08.188 --> 30:10.442
Come over here
and make me shut up, then.

30:10.591 --> 30:11.844
Yo, you starting
to piss me off

30:11.992 --> 30:12.912
'cause you don't know
what you're doing.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.014
You're too stupid.

30:14.161 --> 30:16.116
Hey, Z, you do the top
while I do the middle.

30:16.264 --> 30:18.664
Darnell, you got
the leg parts, all right?

30:20.536 --> 30:24.268
Yeah yeah.
Like that. Like that.

30:48.504 --> 30:50.132
Shit!

30:57.716 --> 30:58.603
Done.

30:58.750 --> 31:01.906
Aw, that's bullshit.

31:02.055 --> 31:03.642
He's cheating, yo.

31:03.789 --> 31:05.211
Go ahead and touch
it, baby.

31:05.359 --> 31:06.712
That shit
built to last.

31:06.860 --> 31:08.782
What about the extra pieces?

31:08.929 --> 31:09.954
What extra pieces?

31:14.770 --> 31:16.891
What's in your pocket?

31:17.039 --> 31:18.563
Ain't nothing in my pocket.

31:19.875 --> 31:23.039
So, uh, who cook a good
steak around here?

31:29.821 --> 31:30.776
Okay.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.911
One-- From the day
of my inauguration,

31:33.059 --> 31:34.747
Commissioner Burrell
is to undertake no initiative

31:34.895 --> 31:36.382
without
clearing it with you.

31:36.530 --> 31:37.918
Day-to-day administrative
responsibilities

31:38.065 --> 31:39.353
are to reside with
the deputy office

31:39.501 --> 31:40.888
if they don't already.

31:41.037 --> 31:43.058
I like that.
No problem.

31:43.205 --> 31:44.559
Two-- I need to elevate
Stan Valchek.

31:44.707 --> 31:45.795
Good man, Valchek.

31:45.942 --> 31:47.797
He's a hack, but he's my
hack, and I owe him.

31:47.946 --> 31:49.065
If I make him
Deputy for Admin,

31:49.214 --> 31:50.332
can he cause
any real damage?

31:50.480 --> 31:52.101
I'll watch over him.
No problem.

31:52.249 --> 31:54.704
Three-- I'm bumping Daniels
from Western Command to colonel,

31:54.852 --> 31:56.206
giving him ClD
and carte blanche

31:56.354 --> 31:57.442
to fix
the investigative units.

31:57.589 --> 32:00.144
- Cedric Daniels?
- Problem?

32:00.292 --> 32:02.314
No, he's good police.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.650
He's just got...

32:03.797 --> 32:05.818
a little
independent streak.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.867
Independent from who?

32:09.270 --> 32:11.526
I got no problem
making Daniels.

32:11.673 --> 32:12.561
What else do you need?

32:12.708 --> 32:14.396
That's it for now.

32:14.544 --> 32:17.467
Mr. Mayor, about Ervin--

32:17.615 --> 32:18.801
if you don't mind
my asking,

32:18.949 --> 32:20.370
why keep him as
a puppet commissioner

32:20.517 --> 32:21.746
when you can just
fire the guy?

32:26.258 --> 32:27.920
We mind you asking.

32:39.107 --> 32:41.043
I'm partial
to them cherries.

32:43.947 --> 32:45.033
Yo, Dukie.

32:45.181 --> 32:46.169
Hmm?

32:46.316 --> 32:48.538
You ever call Social
Services on your mother?

32:48.686 --> 32:50.106
What?

32:50.255 --> 32:52.143
I don't know.
I just want to know what happens

32:52.291 --> 32:54.145
if you call Social
Services on somebody.

32:54.294 --> 32:55.847
You want to
report your mother?

32:55.995 --> 32:58.850
She brung someone home
and he won't leave.

32:58.998 --> 33:00.819
You don't want to
call Social Services.

33:00.967 --> 33:02.354
They get to looking
into things,

33:02.503 --> 33:04.157
they could put you
in a group home,

33:04.306 --> 33:06.860
split you and Bug
up, even.

33:07.008 --> 33:08.195
But I don't
want us to leave.

33:08.343 --> 33:10.765
I just want
him to leave.

33:10.913 --> 33:12.367
Talking about Bug's daddy,
ain't you?

33:12.516 --> 33:14.136
Maybe you ought to
talk to a teacher about this.

33:14.283 --> 33:18.107
I mean, Mr. Pryzbo is
real good about stuff.

33:18.256 --> 33:21.112
Mr. P did say I could go talk
to the school social worker.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.748
He an alcoholic.

33:23.896 --> 33:26.661
Oh, um, what about that boxing
guy, Mr. Cutty?

33:28.202 --> 33:29.499
What's wrong with Cutty?

33:31.305 --> 33:32.926
I don't know.

33:33.074 --> 33:36.130
Like, he just
too friendly, you know?

33:36.277 --> 33:38.499
That shit
creep me out, man.

33:38.647 --> 33:40.502
Like, he some type of
faggot or something.

33:40.649 --> 33:41.903
Nah, not Cutty, man.

33:42.051 --> 33:43.673
He be all up
in the women.

33:43.820 --> 33:45.241
Yo, don't you see
how he be doing?

33:45.389 --> 33:46.542
That don't mean shit.

33:46.690 --> 33:48.478
Them faggots will be
just like that, too.

33:48.626 --> 33:51.315
And I don't know.
He just too friendly, you know?

33:51.464 --> 33:53.557
Everybody just too
motherfucking friendly.

34:10.987 --> 34:13.041
No fucking way.

34:13.188 --> 34:15.945
So, his name is--
what'd you call him?

34:16.092 --> 34:17.547
It's like a joke.

34:17.695 --> 34:19.254
Yeah. They flipped it.

34:20.498 --> 34:23.800
- Bunch of fucking clowns.
- Mm-hmm.

34:25.505 --> 34:29.500
Last year we had MSAs
in the 22 percentile.

34:30.745 --> 34:32.565
And don't think they
haven't noticed it

34:32.714 --> 34:34.601
down at the Puzzle Palace.

34:34.750 --> 34:38.440
The word is they're looking for
at least a 10-point increase

34:38.588 --> 34:42.010
from all city middle
schools this time around.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.013
We're still six weeks
away from the MSAs

34:44.161 --> 34:46.016
and you want us to start
teaching the test now?

34:46.164 --> 34:50.261
This year, the preferred term
is "Curriculum Alignment."

34:51.670 --> 34:53.190
There's nothing wrong
with emphasizing the skills

34:53.339 --> 34:55.327
necessary for the MSA.

34:55.475 --> 34:56.896
If we can get them
to write a paragraph

34:57.043 --> 34:58.665
without a four-letter
word in it,

34:58.813 --> 35:01.435
it'll have to have better
command of English.

35:01.583 --> 35:02.903
Marcia, skill sets
are one thing,

35:03.051 --> 35:05.040
but this has us teaching
test questions direct,

35:05.188 --> 35:06.675
test questions
that involve skills.

35:06.823 --> 35:07.742
I don't see your point.

35:07.891 --> 35:09.412
You don't want
to see the point.

35:09.560 --> 35:12.481
Were you really expecting
something different than last year?

35:12.630 --> 35:14.452
I don't see the math section.
These are all language arts questions.

35:14.599 --> 35:17.187
Our greatest failing on
standardized tests last year.

35:17.335 --> 35:18.322
So, for the time being,

35:18.471 --> 35:20.324
all teachers will
devote class time

35:20.473 --> 35:23.637
to teaching language arts
sample questions.

35:25.812 --> 35:27.467
Now, if you turn
to page 11, please,

35:27.615 --> 35:29.837
I have some things
I want to go over with you.

35:29.984 --> 35:31.505
I don't get it.

35:31.652 --> 35:34.876
All this so we score
higher on the state tests?

35:35.024 --> 35:37.546
If we're teaching the kids
the test questions,

35:37.695 --> 35:38.948
what is it assessing in them?

35:39.096 --> 35:39.982
Nothing.

35:40.130 --> 35:41.250
It assesses us.

35:41.398 --> 35:42.419
The test scores go up,

35:42.567 --> 35:44.321
they can say the schools
are improving.

35:44.469 --> 35:46.257
The scores stay down,
they can't.

35:46.404 --> 35:49.894
- Juking the stats.
- Excuse me?

35:50.042 --> 35:52.030
Making robberies
into larcenies,

35:52.178 --> 35:54.567
making rapes disappear--

35:54.715 --> 35:58.739
you juke the stats
and majors become colonels.

35:58.887 --> 36:00.474
I've been here before.

36:00.623 --> 36:03.820
Wherever you go,
there you are.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.154
Raven's got that
dude Mike Anderson.

36:11.303 --> 36:12.822
He and Jamal
gonna be running...

36:12.971 --> 36:16.995
Look at these runts. We're gonna go
when that football's in the air

36:17.143 --> 36:18.163
on a long pass.

36:18.311 --> 36:19.198
Slow?

36:19.345 --> 36:20.233
Yeah.

36:20.381 --> 36:22.936
Big yellow right here.

36:23.083 --> 36:23.970
Yellows, yellows!

36:24.117 --> 36:25.605
Go long. Go go.

36:25.753 --> 36:26.639
Throw it high.

36:26.787 --> 36:28.141
Big yellow.

36:28.290 --> 36:30.445
Go.

36:30.592 --> 36:31.713
- Narco!
- Oh, shit!

36:31.861 --> 36:33.726
Po-po,
yo! Po-po!

36:41.072 --> 36:42.460
- Where you going?
- Put me down, bitch!

36:42.607 --> 36:44.028
They're in the alleys.

36:44.176 --> 36:45.898
We get back in there,
we can hunt them up.

36:46.045 --> 36:47.900
No need.
I know 'em all.

36:48.048 --> 36:50.202
- Let me go, motherfucker!
- What about this one?

36:50.351 --> 36:51.271
He isn't even bait.

36:51.419 --> 36:52.405
We toss him back--

36:52.553 --> 36:53.707
unless you want to
spend half the shift

36:53.854 --> 36:55.009
down at baby booking.

36:55.157 --> 36:56.043
Me?

36:56.192 --> 36:57.611
I ain't afraid,
motherfucker!

36:57.759 --> 36:59.547
I don't want to spend this shift
down at Evidence Control.

36:59.695 --> 37:01.081
Then why the fuck
even do this?

37:01.230 --> 37:02.317
So's I can talk to them.

37:02.464 --> 37:04.920
I like to think that until
the handcuffs actually fit,

37:05.069 --> 37:06.855
there's still talking
to be done.

37:07.004 --> 37:08.991
Come here, man.
Let's take a walk.

37:09.140 --> 37:10.767
You shut the fuck up.

37:14.113 --> 37:15.767
Yo, who we listening to?

37:15.915 --> 37:18.971
Miss Lady Day,
Billie Holliday.

37:19.119 --> 37:20.440
Yeah, she sounds good.

37:20.587 --> 37:22.317
You know, real sad,
kind of.

37:24.759 --> 37:25.679
Yeah. I'm like that.

37:25.828 --> 37:26.914
You be thinking
I'm all ghetto,

37:27.062 --> 37:30.252
and then I flip it and
mess your mind all up.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.887
The next time we
do this, Mr. Colvin,

37:32.035 --> 37:34.557
could you please
make it on the weekend?

37:34.704 --> 37:36.192
I only had,
like, three hours

37:36.339 --> 37:37.927
between school
and now to get ready.

37:38.075 --> 37:39.363
Well, you look
fine, Zenobia.

37:39.510 --> 37:40.631
I could look better.

37:40.778 --> 37:43.534
How long you think it take
to do hair like this?

37:43.683 --> 37:46.438
I'm ordering the biggest
quarter-pounder. Fries, too.

37:46.586 --> 37:47.840
Nigger,
this ain't Mickey D's.

37:47.987 --> 37:50.476
You better be thinking
T-bone steak, medium rare.

37:50.625 --> 37:51.645
The blood
all squirting out?

37:51.792 --> 37:53.046
Nah, ain't no blood.

37:53.194 --> 37:54.147
What you think rare is?

37:54.295 --> 37:55.950
It mean rarely cooked,
hardly cooked?

37:56.098 --> 37:57.085
Rare.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.586
Get the blood out, stupid.

37:58.735 --> 37:59.621
See?

37:59.770 --> 38:01.724
And medium rare,
keep the blood in.

38:01.873 --> 38:02.725
All right. Look.

38:02.874 --> 38:04.294
All I want to know
which is which

38:04.442 --> 38:06.096
before I order
some undone meat.

38:06.244 --> 38:07.697
- Hey, Mr. Colvin.
- Huh?

38:07.845 --> 38:09.199
How it work?

38:09.347 --> 38:11.234
Look, we're just
gonna ask the waiter. All right?

38:11.383 --> 38:13.371
Oh, shit.
There's a waiter?

38:13.520 --> 38:15.078
Just right
down the block.

38:16.323 --> 38:17.442
Where she at, dawg?

38:17.591 --> 38:18.810
Ain't seen her.

38:18.959 --> 38:19.846
She owe me.

38:19.994 --> 38:20.947
All that shit I gave her.

38:21.096 --> 38:23.587
Yeah, I know.
I don't know.

38:25.835 --> 38:26.888
How you not know?

38:27.036 --> 38:28.490
I don't know.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.192
She let me find her,
I'm gonna cut her titty off.

38:30.340 --> 38:32.228
Watch.

38:32.377 --> 38:33.697
You got something
to say, nigger?

38:33.844 --> 38:35.065
No no.

38:35.213 --> 38:36.568
Yo, where Herc at?

38:36.715 --> 38:38.770
I got the asshole, okay?

38:38.918 --> 38:41.438
Tell him Riggs and Calhoun.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.641
He knows. He knows.

38:43.789 --> 38:44.779
Okay.

38:49.731 --> 38:50.952
Get the fuck back here.

38:51.099 --> 38:52.887
Nigger, I will fuck you up.

38:53.034 --> 38:55.590
You don't know Lex?

38:55.739 --> 38:56.858
I knew the Bull.

38:57.006 --> 38:59.128
I mean, I know him.

38:59.275 --> 39:00.396
But he ain't been
around though.

39:00.544 --> 39:02.632
You see? Right there.
You just fucked up.

39:02.780 --> 39:04.635
You said you "knew" him,
like you knew he was dead.

39:04.783 --> 39:07.071
No. Now you putting
words in my mouth.

39:07.219 --> 39:08.940
I meant, "knew him."

39:09.088 --> 39:12.378
When he was around,
I knew him. But he left.

39:12.526 --> 39:13.959
Herc.

39:19.167 --> 39:20.053
Bubbles called.

39:20.201 --> 39:21.622
He sees the guy--
the asshole.

39:21.771 --> 39:22.657
He's on Riggs
and Calhoun.

39:22.805 --> 39:23.791
Says he'll
hold him there

39:23.939 --> 39:25.828
five minutes for you
to get across town.

39:25.975 --> 39:27.596
I'm in the middle
of an interview here.

39:27.744 --> 39:29.431
What the fuck?

39:29.580 --> 39:32.068
Tell him we'll fix
his problem tomorrow.

39:32.216 --> 39:33.547
All right?

39:36.655 --> 39:38.242
Oh, motherfucker.

39:38.391 --> 39:40.012
He ain't got a phone.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.747
You lied to me
out on the street.

39:41.896 --> 39:44.917
Why should l
believe you now?

39:45.066 --> 39:47.021
You was there
when Lex got killed.

39:47.169 --> 39:48.589
You part of the
fucking setup.

39:48.738 --> 39:51.959
We know 'cause we have a witness
who put you right in there.

39:52.107 --> 39:53.360
Yeah, we do.

39:53.509 --> 39:56.205
You know right
where that body is.

39:57.681 --> 39:58.834
You were there with Snoop,

39:58.982 --> 40:01.076
Chris, whoever else.

40:04.389 --> 40:07.880
Know how to make
an interrogation work?

40:08.028 --> 40:09.481
Leverage.

40:09.629 --> 40:11.250
We don't have leverage?

40:11.399 --> 40:12.919
Motherfucker,
you don't even got a body.

40:13.067 --> 40:14.865
Lex is nothing
but a name in there.

40:18.608 --> 40:21.363
Where the fuck
you think you're going?

40:21.511 --> 40:22.842
You ain't going nowhere.

40:25.248 --> 40:26.237
Hey.

40:28.519 --> 40:29.739
Hello!

40:29.888 --> 40:32.142
Home Depot here!
Home Depot!

40:32.290 --> 40:33.777
What you got
for me tonight?

40:33.925 --> 40:35.313
I've been missing you
all day long, dawg.

40:35.460 --> 40:37.248
No no. We done with this right here.
We done with this.

40:37.396 --> 40:39.018
Say what? Don't play, man.
I ain't got time for your shit.

40:39.166 --> 40:41.053
My shit's all you're
gonna get, all right?

40:41.202 --> 40:43.727
You can kiss my ass, all the
fucking trouble you given me.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.694
Oh, hey.

40:46.842 --> 40:48.062
What you looking for, huh?

40:48.210 --> 40:49.431
It's not there.
It's on me, all right?

40:49.578 --> 40:50.466
It's on you?

40:50.614 --> 40:51.600
Yeah.

40:51.748 --> 40:54.046
- It's on you?
- Wait wait wait!

40:57.655 --> 40:58.942
Oh, no no no!

40:59.089 --> 41:01.082
Get off me!
Get off me!

41:03.395 --> 41:04.715
Come on! Get off!

41:04.864 --> 41:06.051
Hey, wait wait wait!

41:06.199 --> 41:07.385
You take it!
Take it!

41:07.533 --> 41:08.521
I got you now!

41:08.668 --> 41:09.658
No no no!

41:11.405 --> 41:14.307
Like that?
Fuck!

41:29.395 --> 41:30.782
I don't like the orange ones.

41:30.930 --> 41:32.382
Listen to me, fuckhead.

41:32.531 --> 41:33.684
We know you were there.

41:33.832 --> 41:35.052
We know you set him up,

41:35.200 --> 41:36.989
and we know you didn't
do it alone.

41:37.137 --> 41:38.157
Say what?

41:38.305 --> 41:39.191
You weren't alone in this.

41:39.340 --> 41:41.327
We know that.

41:41.475 --> 41:43.067
You mean Randy?

41:47.283 --> 41:49.739
I'm asking you
questions, remember?

41:49.886 --> 41:51.374
If you don't give us
this murder, Kevin,

41:51.521 --> 41:53.177
somebody else will.
And when they do,

41:53.324 --> 41:54.545
they'll be putting you in.

41:54.692 --> 41:55.751
You hear me?

42:10.211 --> 42:11.965
Colvin, party of four.

42:12.113 --> 42:13.233
I'll make sure
your table's ready.

42:13.382 --> 42:16.003
"Colvin, party of four," huh?

42:16.151 --> 42:18.440
Hi. May I take your coat?

42:18.587 --> 42:20.577
Sure.

42:20.724 --> 42:21.811
You, sir?

42:21.958 --> 42:23.613
Oh, no.
I'm good.

42:23.761 --> 42:25.320
Yeah, me too.

42:27.099 --> 42:29.387
Okay, your table's ready.

42:29.534 --> 42:31.400
Follow me, please.

42:50.060 --> 42:51.381
Sir?

42:51.528 --> 42:52.415
That's your chair, right?

42:52.563 --> 42:53.750
No.

42:53.898 --> 42:54.922
You sit there.

42:56.802 --> 42:58.155
The waitress
will be here soon

42:58.303 --> 43:01.526
to detail the specials
of the day.

43:01.675 --> 43:02.561
Enjoy.

43:02.710 --> 43:04.230
Thank you.

43:04.378 --> 43:05.398
Waitress?

43:05.546 --> 43:06.666
Who was that?

43:06.815 --> 43:08.002
That's the, uh, hostess.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.504
Hey, you ain't
gotta worry, Mr. C.

43:09.651 --> 43:10.671
I ain't gonna
run up your bill.

43:10.820 --> 43:12.807
I'll just get
whatever's on special.

43:12.955 --> 43:15.677
It ain't no K-Mart
Blue Light Special, dumbass.

43:15.825 --> 43:19.482
Special just mean they
cook something different.

43:19.630 --> 43:22.251
Yo, what about you,
drinking without a straw,

43:22.400 --> 43:23.319
all ghetto and shit?

43:23.468 --> 43:26.023
You don't drink water
with a straw.

43:26.172 --> 43:27.859
And put that on
your lap, fool.

43:28.007 --> 43:29.127
You see anybody
else up in here

43:29.275 --> 43:31.471
Iooking all
Fred Flintstone
and shit?

43:33.013 --> 43:33.899
Shh.

43:34.048 --> 43:34.934
Shut it down.

43:35.083 --> 43:37.571
Other people
be looking at us.

43:37.718 --> 43:39.440
Hello. My name is Pam.

43:39.588 --> 43:42.176
I'd like to tell you about
our specials for the day.

43:42.325 --> 43:45.048
We have king salmon
with sweet corn,

43:45.195 --> 43:47.551
chanterelles
and basil aioli;

43:47.698 --> 43:51.587
sauteed free-range chicken
served with mashed potatoes;

43:51.735 --> 43:55.960
fresh Chesapeake Bay blue crab,
roasted garlic, shallot cream

43:56.109 --> 43:57.861
and hen-of-the-woods
mushrooms;

43:58.010 --> 43:59.931
and wood-oven-roasted
quail

44:00.079 --> 44:02.868
with grilled bread salad.

44:03.016 --> 44:04.838
Dang, I thought
y'all had steak.

44:04.986 --> 44:05.872
Oh, we do...

44:06.020 --> 44:09.243
on the second page
of your menus.

44:09.391 --> 44:11.325
May I get your drink orders?

44:16.434 --> 44:18.788
Yeah.
We'll take four cokes, please.

44:18.936 --> 44:19.991
Right away.

44:20.138 --> 44:21.163
Thank you.

44:36.625 --> 44:38.890
Do you mind
if I come tomorrow?

44:41.764 --> 44:43.219
Mind?

44:43.367 --> 44:44.891
I--

44:46.938 --> 44:48.225
You wouldn't
be embarrassed?

44:48.373 --> 44:50.171
No, not at all.

44:54.413 --> 44:57.770
I mean...

44:57.918 --> 44:59.613
I'll be proud
if you're there.

45:02.757 --> 45:04.845
It's funny
how it works out.

45:04.992 --> 45:08.115
All those years I'm trying
to climb the ladder,

45:08.263 --> 45:11.053
kissing ass, covering ass,
doing what I'm told.

45:11.201 --> 45:13.489
I finally let some of it out,
tell 'em what I really think,

45:13.637 --> 45:15.191
and I'm going from
lieutenant to colonel

45:15.339 --> 45:18.462
in a little more than a year.

45:18.610 --> 45:21.533
And, you, you're worried sick
about those subpoenas

45:21.681 --> 45:23.102
and worried that Lester's
killing you with your boss--

45:23.249 --> 45:25.343
But the subpoenas
get me promoted.

45:27.654 --> 45:30.811
I know.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.445
You know, Marlo
once said to me,

45:32.594 --> 45:34.848
"You cannot lose if
you do not play."

45:34.997 --> 45:36.055
But here we are, right?

45:46.945 --> 45:48.933
Maybe it's changing.

45:49.081 --> 45:51.268
What is?

45:51.417 --> 45:54.750
The city, the way
things work or don't.

45:57.325 --> 45:58.544
Maybe we're turning
a corner here

45:58.693 --> 46:01.094
and it's not gonna be so
unbelievably fucked up anymore.

46:03.565 --> 46:06.521
To Carcetti.

46:06.668 --> 46:07.761
And us.

46:14.211 --> 46:15.499
Zenobia,

46:15.647 --> 46:17.033
you want to take a picture
of the restaurant, right?

46:17.182 --> 46:18.202
That's okay.
It's late.

46:18.349 --> 46:19.304
No no. That's fine.

46:19.451 --> 46:20.404
Come on. Give
me the camera.

46:20.552 --> 46:21.707
I'm okay.

46:21.855 --> 46:24.276
Come on, give
me the camera.

46:24.425 --> 46:25.414
Okay.

46:27.461 --> 46:29.191
Y'all want to be in
the picture, right?

46:37.241 --> 46:40.463
Yo, Mr. C, can
we stop at McDonald's?

46:40.610 --> 46:42.866
- Fuck wrong with you, boy?
- Food wasn't right.

46:43.013 --> 46:44.333
Don't like fish.

46:44.482 --> 46:46.103
Why'd you order it, then?

46:46.251 --> 46:48.243
Yo, shut the fuck up.

46:56.631 --> 46:58.852
- Turn it down.
- What?

46:59.001 --> 47:00.288
Turn it down, Namond.

47:00.435 --> 47:01.869
Turn it up?
All right, you got it.

47:03.073 --> 47:05.327
Seriously, can we get
some fries at least?

47:05.475 --> 47:07.362
Boy, you is pathetic.

47:07.511 --> 47:10.066
Just 'cause you a girl do not
mean I won't fuck you all up.

47:10.215 --> 47:11.302
You hear me?

47:11.449 --> 47:13.337
Nigger, please.

47:13.485 --> 47:15.171
Yeah, you keep
talking all of that shit.

47:15.320 --> 47:16.508
No, you keep talking
all that shit.

47:16.655 --> 47:18.910
- Must have forgot.
- No, I ain't forget shit.

47:19.058 --> 47:20.779
- What I forget anyway?
- That I'm the man.

47:20.928 --> 47:21.914
Okay.

47:22.061 --> 47:25.419
So, what's
the first thing we do

47:25.566 --> 47:28.122
when we respond
to a prompt?

47:28.269 --> 47:30.325
Randy?

47:30.473 --> 47:32.293
"According
to the text..."?

47:32.441 --> 47:35.764
"According to the text."

47:35.912 --> 47:37.132
That's good.

47:37.281 --> 47:39.536
And how do we
end the answer?

47:39.684 --> 47:40.570
Quenice?

47:40.719 --> 47:41.871
- Huh?
- Come on.

47:42.020 --> 47:43.385
I know you know this.

47:47.861 --> 47:52.085
"The above-stated facts have
led me to conclude that..."

47:52.232 --> 47:53.252
Right?

47:53.401 --> 47:54.354
Okay.

47:54.502 --> 47:56.123
So, let's try to read
the third paragraph.

47:56.270 --> 47:57.424
I'll start it.

47:57.572 --> 48:00.495
"Pythias makes a final plea
to the tyrant Dionysius

48:00.643 --> 48:05.368
to return to his home
one last--" Calvin, pick it up.

48:05.516 --> 48:07.471
"To return to his
home one last time

48:07.618 --> 48:09.306
before his punishment.

48:09.454 --> 48:14.313
He denies the request
until Damon inter..."

48:14.460 --> 48:15.951
"lntercedes."

48:18.499 --> 48:21.288
"...and offers his own life
until Pythias returns."

48:21.436 --> 48:23.088
Good.

48:23.237 --> 48:25.535
Who wants to guess what
"intercedes" means?

48:33.450 --> 48:34.712
What about "plea"?

48:37.989 --> 48:39.043
Okay.

48:39.191 --> 48:41.746
What about the story, then?

48:41.893 --> 48:44.382
How would you summarize it?

48:44.531 --> 48:47.820
Duquan, give it a shot.

48:47.968 --> 48:49.556
"According to the text..."

48:49.703 --> 48:51.365
everybody's safe
in the end, right?

48:54.343 --> 48:55.396
Okay.

48:55.544 --> 48:56.432
Let's think this through.

48:56.579 --> 48:58.066
"According to the text,

48:58.214 --> 49:01.069
Damon offers his own life
on behalf of Pythias

49:01.218 --> 49:03.172
so that he can return home
one last time.

49:03.320 --> 49:06.009
The above-stated facts
have led me to conclude

49:06.157 --> 49:10.094
that Damon values Pythias'
friendship and loyalty."

49:14.067 --> 49:15.466
Any questions?

49:19.006 --> 49:21.628
We want four of the raw.

49:21.776 --> 49:23.832
275 large right there.

49:23.979 --> 49:26.234
For four
it should be three.

49:26.382 --> 49:29.538
I'm charging five a head on them New
York boys. That about the going rate.

49:29.686 --> 49:31.473
Still want us
on that?

49:31.622 --> 49:34.444
Nah, seems like they got
the message and went the fuck on.

49:34.591 --> 49:35.812
True that.

49:35.959 --> 49:38.850
Delroy has all of the
Monument Street corners back.

49:38.998 --> 49:41.319
All right, then. Holler at us
when the next package in.

49:41.467 --> 49:44.289
Uh, you remember when I told
you about the co-op meant

49:44.437 --> 49:46.159
we all stand together,

49:46.306 --> 49:48.228
doing for each
other when we can?

49:48.376 --> 49:50.531
You remember that?

49:50.678 --> 49:54.569
Well, the price of four raw
is 300.

49:54.717 --> 49:56.204
And your work on them
New York boys

49:56.352 --> 49:58.940
already been factored
into the price, you see?

49:59.089 --> 50:00.943
On the other hand,

50:01.091 --> 50:04.181
we got something that you want, and it's
coming back to you... free of charge.

50:04.330 --> 50:07.351
Someone you looking for.

50:07.499 --> 50:10.088
Co-op mean
what it sound like, dawg.

50:10.235 --> 50:14.297
You happy to do for me,
I'm happy to do for you.

50:15.309 --> 50:17.931
Congratulations,
Colonel.

50:18.078 --> 50:22.069
Congratulations,
Deputy Commissioner.

50:22.217 --> 50:24.238
Congratulations to all
those who were promoted,

50:24.386 --> 50:25.974
their families, and friends.

50:26.122 --> 50:27.577
It's a proud day for them

50:27.724 --> 50:30.660
and a proud day for the
Baltimore Police Department.

50:40.940 --> 50:41.893
I am so proud of you.

50:42.041 --> 50:43.770
Oh, thank you.

50:46.280 --> 50:49.903
You know, Valchek
we could have guessed.

50:50.051 --> 50:53.341
I mean, he's
Carcetti's man, but...

50:53.489 --> 50:54.923
Daniels?

50:58.929 --> 51:02.319
Long time for you to make major,
but this was quick enough.

51:02.468 --> 51:04.388
Yeah, who's your
new rabbi, huh?

51:04.536 --> 51:06.258
Colonel.

51:06.405 --> 51:07.926
So, they didn't
know the salad fork

51:08.073 --> 51:10.997
from whatever the fuck
the other fork is for. So what?

51:11.144 --> 51:13.933
I knew they'd be at a loss,
but the extent of it...

51:14.081 --> 51:16.102
I'm talking
about feelings--

51:16.251 --> 51:17.838
why they
feeling this...

51:17.986 --> 51:21.175
this plummet from masters
of the universe to abject fear

51:21.324 --> 51:23.111
to humiliated fury
and no awareness of it.

51:23.259 --> 51:24.480
Who says
they're not aware?

51:24.627 --> 51:25.848
Maybe they just
didn't acknowledge.

51:25.996 --> 51:28.552
Either way. But my point is,
where do you start with them?

51:28.699 --> 51:29.752
How you get them to
believe in themselves

51:29.901 --> 51:31.154
if they can't even
admit their feelings

51:31.302 --> 51:34.526
about who they are and what
they're doing in this world?

51:34.674 --> 51:36.594
They're not fools.

51:36.743 --> 51:38.797
They know exactly what
we expect them to be.

51:38.945 --> 51:41.535
Y'all missed some meal
for real, though.

51:41.682 --> 51:42.769
Take your seats.

51:42.917 --> 51:43.803
It was hot, yo.

51:43.952 --> 51:45.606
"Party of four,
Mr. Colvin."

51:45.753 --> 51:47.308
"May I take your coat,
Mr. Brice?"

51:47.456 --> 51:48.976
Ha!
That shit was tight.

51:49.124 --> 51:50.878
I'm dreaming about
that chocolate cake.

51:51.026 --> 51:52.947
Oh my God.

51:53.096 --> 51:56.185
Shit had, like,
56 layers, yo!

51:56.333 --> 51:57.823
"...in the check-room,
Mr. Colvin...

52:03.575 --> 52:05.942
"D Money saves Pitman"?

52:10.784 --> 52:12.514
It's bullshit!

52:14.156 --> 52:16.886
Before, at least they were
getting something out of it.

52:18.728 --> 52:20.549
To hell with my evaluation.
To hell with Donnelly,

52:20.697 --> 52:21.917
to hell with the
statewide test scores.

52:22.065 --> 52:23.751
I came here to teach.

52:23.900 --> 52:25.299
Right?

52:32.277 --> 52:35.066
Yo, Coach, seen Michael?

52:35.215 --> 52:36.101
Nah.

52:36.249 --> 52:38.471
All right.

52:38.619 --> 52:39.973
That wasn't you
and your runts

52:40.121 --> 52:42.920
I saw down on Bentlow
yesterday, slinging?

52:44.092 --> 52:45.180
Right.

52:45.328 --> 52:46.581
'Cause a gangster
like yourself

52:46.728 --> 52:48.283
wouldn't set up such
a weak-ass shop

52:48.431 --> 52:51.954
with no real lookouts,
ground stash in plain view.

52:52.103 --> 52:53.724
This is me telling y'all
as plain as I can.

52:53.872 --> 52:55.292
You guys had
your one chance.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.660
I see you out there
a second time,

52:56.808 --> 52:59.496
everyone takes a beating
and goes to Cheltenham.

52:59.645 --> 53:01.299
Fair warning you just got.

53:01.446 --> 53:03.435
Cheltenham for
some drug charges?

53:03.582 --> 53:04.737
Please, man.

53:04.884 --> 53:06.338
I'll write you up
as a special.

53:06.486 --> 53:07.606
Don't think I won't do it.

53:07.754 --> 53:09.943
Jab, jab! Good.

53:10.091 --> 53:11.411
He don't think
I can jail?

53:11.559 --> 53:13.381
Shit!
I can jail...

53:13.529 --> 53:15.384
- What's up?
- Namond's banging, huh?

53:15.531 --> 53:17.386
Yeah.
He's one of yours, right?

53:17.533 --> 53:19.021
He hang around
the gym,

53:19.170 --> 53:21.391
mostly waiting on
his boy Michael.

53:21.539 --> 53:23.092
He don't box or nothing.

53:23.241 --> 53:26.364
He ain't that kind, really.
Not like his father.

53:26.511 --> 53:28.667
- Who was his father?
- Dude named Wee-Bey.

53:28.815 --> 53:30.803
Stone-headed. Used to run
with them Barksdales.

53:30.950 --> 53:31.969
I know him.

53:32.118 --> 53:33.672
Shit, I locked him up
in Philadelphia.

53:33.820 --> 53:35.140
Yeah?

53:35.289 --> 53:36.642
Bey was my cut buddy.

53:36.790 --> 53:39.646
We jailed down Jessup.

53:39.793 --> 53:42.582
Anyway, Namond's from him.

53:42.731 --> 53:45.097
Same blood,
but not the same heart.

53:46.469 --> 53:47.689
I've done my
warm-ups, Coach.

53:47.838 --> 53:49.558
Yeah. We ready
for the ring!

53:49.707 --> 53:50.731
Take care, man.

53:58.918 --> 53:59.905
Why we stopping here?

54:00.053 --> 54:01.641
I thought we was
going straight out.

54:01.788 --> 54:03.943
Gotta get with
your escort out.

54:04.092 --> 54:05.877
Prop Joe said you
was my escort out.

54:06.026 --> 54:08.756
Manner of speaking,
that be true.

54:18.542 --> 54:23.503
Come on over here, man.
Come on.

54:26.318 --> 54:27.706
Chris, no.

54:27.853 --> 54:29.378
You know I keep
it quick, Dre.

54:31.726 --> 54:33.446
- Here?
- Here's good.

54:33.594 --> 54:35.182
Not-- not in a vacant.

54:35.329 --> 54:36.584
What's the difference?

54:36.732 --> 54:37.985
The difference
is my people.

54:38.133 --> 54:39.020
They won't know.

54:39.167 --> 54:40.054
They'll know.

54:40.202 --> 54:42.523
But-- but-- but
the rats.

54:42.671 --> 54:44.392
I'll be alone
with the rats.

54:44.539 --> 54:46.928
You're all right.
I got your back.

54:47.076 --> 54:47.963
Come on, Chris.

54:48.112 --> 54:49.866
Let me do it in
my house so my people--

54:50.014 --> 54:51.505
they can give me
a home go.

54:57.723 --> 54:59.578
I'll be damned.

54:59.726 --> 55:00.614
Que?

55:00.761 --> 55:03.283
Hey, yo, that got
to be Marlo, man.

55:03.430 --> 55:05.252
You see?

55:05.401 --> 55:06.853
That's the man we robbed, yo,

55:07.002 --> 55:09.090
from the poker game.

55:09.238 --> 55:11.059
Ah...

55:11.207 --> 55:13.328
si, si, si.

55:13.476 --> 55:15.740
No wonder the boy
don't like me.

55:16.913 --> 55:19.576
Hmmph.

56:25.832 --> 56:28.062
Thought maybe I could
catch up with Chris.

56:34.777 --> 56:38.236
I got a problem I can't
bring to no one else.

56:57.304 --> 56:58.328
Quien es?

57:13.691 --> 57:15.921
He just a kid.

57:16.305 --> 57:22.188
