00:00.023 --> 00:02.224
<i>Previously on "Royal Pains"...</i>

00:02.259 --> 00:05.076
Hey, guys, I'm Evan. I'm the
hospital administrator.

00:05.102 --> 00:06.836
I'm Wes. This is Ian.

00:06.871 --> 00:08.537
That makes you Lena, right?

00:08.573 --> 00:09.738
So your doctor tells me

00:09.774 --> 00:11.240
you're checking out
against medical advice?

00:11.275 --> 00:13.275
Yeah, because this stupid hospital

00:13.311 --> 00:15.144
decided to send a social
worker to my house.

00:15.179 --> 00:17.079
But now there's gonna be a
child services investigation

00:17.114 --> 00:19.548
and hearing, so thank you very
much for messing up our lives.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.317
Hank, I want to apply to medical school.

00:24.889 --> 00:27.623
You know, Hank, your
father blames himself

00:27.658 --> 00:29.158
for all of your relationship problems.

00:29.193 --> 00:30.492
What do you mean?

00:30.528 --> 00:32.027
He's afraid you've become more like him,

00:32.063 --> 00:34.196
and he thinks that's why you
can't seem to settle down.

00:34.232 --> 00:35.831
Maybe it's time for me
to make a change too.

00:35.867 --> 00:37.132
What kind of change?

00:37.168 --> 00:39.068
A big one.

00:39.103 --> 00:41.303
Maybe as big as the one
that brought me out here.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

00:54.719 --> 00:56.785
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:56.821 --> 00:59.021
Will you look at my face
and see how tired I am?

00:59.056 --> 01:00.456
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- See my eyes?

01:00.458 --> 01:02.491
Yeah, this is me literally
dying to find out

01:02.526 --> 01:04.059
what couldn't wait
another couple hours...

01:04.095 --> 01:06.362
Shh!

01:06.397 --> 01:09.331
To make a very long story
very short, Boris is missing.

01:09.367 --> 01:10.767
Huh?

01:10.768 --> 01:14.003
There are some serious people
who have been after his DNA.

01:14.038 --> 01:16.105
Why would they be after his DN...

01:18.009 --> 01:19.608
That's what the hack at
the hospital was about.

01:19.644 --> 01:21.644
And my trip to Hong Kong.

01:21.679 --> 01:23.079
Boris and I tried to throw
them off the scent,

01:23.080 --> 01:25.881
but it sounds like they caught on.

01:25.917 --> 01:28.117
All right. What do we do now?

01:28.152 --> 01:31.453
We need to flush out the truth.

01:31.489 --> 01:33.289
What's up with the towel?

01:37.428 --> 01:38.828
Oh, that's locked.

01:40.231 --> 01:43.065
Henry, wha... what the
hell are you doing?

01:43.100 --> 01:45.567
- Henry, wait. Wait.
- What?

01:45.603 --> 01:46.769
Are you kidding?

01:46.804 --> 01:47.903
You know this room is wired

01:47.939 --> 01:49.872
with every kind of
silent alarm there is.

01:49.907 --> 01:52.474
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm hoping.

01:55.846 --> 01:58.514
Where do you think all his stuff went?

01:58.549 --> 02:02.284
And why does it smell like
the hospital in here?

02:02.320 --> 02:03.919
The cleaning truck I saw at the wedding.

02:03.955 --> 02:05.054
Yeah?

02:05.089 --> 02:06.188
They must've sanitized this place,

02:06.223 --> 02:08.389
to wipe it of his DNA.

02:08.425 --> 02:12.061
That's probably why he let
us do the wedding here.

02:12.096 --> 02:13.595
It was a perfect cover for the cleanup.

02:13.631 --> 02:16.665
- Exactly.
- Gentlemen.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.267
Good detective work.

02:18.302 --> 02:20.736
Thanks, Boris. It's great to see you.

02:20.771 --> 02:24.673
You're looking well. Love your gloves.

02:24.709 --> 02:27.009
- Great, so we were just, uh...
- You were just...

02:27.044 --> 02:29.945
I was just... I was
just going back to bed.

02:29.981 --> 02:32.581
Is that cool with everyone?

02:32.616 --> 02:33.882
How you doing?

02:33.918 --> 02:36.485
Watch the broken glass...

02:36.520 --> 02:39.021
Boris? What the hell is going on here?

02:46.297 --> 02:48.197
It's become necessary for me to retreat

02:48.232 --> 02:50.032
from public view entirely,

02:50.067 --> 02:53.102
and to cover my tracks.

02:53.137 --> 02:55.571
I've already brought Marisa and Carlos

02:55.606 --> 02:57.906
somewhere I can protect them, so...

02:57.942 --> 02:59.375
If these people are that dangerous,

02:59.410 --> 03:01.010
can't we just go to the FBI?

03:01.045 --> 03:04.646
These people are Russian oligarchs.

03:04.682 --> 03:07.783
The FBI won't scare them off.

03:07.818 --> 03:09.385
That's all you're gonna tell me?

03:09.420 --> 03:11.553
I've always tried to protect you, Hank,

03:11.589 --> 03:14.390
by only telling you
what you need to know.

03:14.425 --> 03:17.359
That's a nice way of putting it.

03:17.395 --> 03:19.194
So if you're trying to
vanish so thoroughly,

03:19.230 --> 03:20.329
why are you back here?

03:20.364 --> 03:23.599
Two reasons: Firstly, I need your help

03:23.634 --> 03:26.335
covering my medical tracks,

03:26.370 --> 03:28.537
and secondly,

03:28.572 --> 03:30.939
I am leaving the Hamptons.

03:30.975 --> 03:33.575
For good...

03:33.611 --> 03:35.611
and I'd like for you to join me.

03:59.271 --> 04:02.998
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:10.305 --> 04:13.173
Uh, morning. How you guys holding up?

04:13.216 --> 04:16.483
Severe fatigue, secondary
to sleep deprivation.

04:16.519 --> 04:19.320
Yeah. Same here.

04:19.356 --> 04:21.089
What a wedding, though.

04:21.124 --> 04:23.958
- An eventful event.
- Hello, I brought coffee.

04:23.994 --> 04:26.594
Oh! Thank you, my sweet angel.

04:26.630 --> 04:29.397
And for the preggers posse,

04:29.432 --> 04:32.367
I brought us an alternative pick-me-up.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.969
Are you ready? It's your favorite.

04:35.005 --> 04:37.105
Ta-da!

04:37.140 --> 04:38.940
- Chocolate croissants!
- Yeah.

04:38.975 --> 04:41.709
You are indeed an angel.

04:41.745 --> 04:45.580
Okay, Divs, I added Ms.
Guizar to your schedule,

04:45.615 --> 04:47.148
so I'll cover your 10:00.

04:47.183 --> 04:49.484
You'll cover Lena's foster
care deposition for me?

04:49.519 --> 04:50.852
Mm-hmm.

04:50.887 --> 04:52.720
But it's just her aunt
formally accepting custody.

04:52.756 --> 04:54.156
I know. I want to go.

04:54.157 --> 04:55.623
If I hadn't called in a social worker,

04:55.659 --> 04:56.924
there wouldn't be a deposition.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.059
So I already told her I'd be there,

04:58.094 --> 04:59.427
just in case I could help with anything.

04:59.462 --> 05:00.862
I'm sure those children mean well,

05:00.897 --> 05:02.297
but they certainly need an adult around

05:02.298 --> 05:03.798
before someone loses an eye,

05:03.833 --> 05:06.200
or gets mauled by a large reptile.

05:06.236 --> 05:08.236
Hmm.

05:10.974 --> 05:12.974
I heard from Johns Hopkins.

05:13.009 --> 05:16.644
Really? And?

05:16.680 --> 05:17.979
I have no idea.

05:18.014 --> 05:20.181
I've been too scared to open the e-mail.

05:20.216 --> 05:22.150
- What?
- You didn't open it?

05:22.185 --> 05:24.052
Open it right now! We're all here!

05:24.087 --> 05:25.653
Okay, okay.

05:39.069 --> 05:42.136
I'll have to call Raj...

05:42.172 --> 05:43.938
tell him I'm officially a student again.

05:43.973 --> 05:46.808
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

05:46.843 --> 05:48.643
- You did it!
- A student at Johns Hopkins!

05:48.678 --> 05:50.611
You did it! She did it!

05:50.647 --> 05:51.813
- That's wonderful!
- She did it!

05:51.848 --> 05:53.614
- That's wonderful news!
- She did it!

05:53.650 --> 05:55.249
That's exactly what I
predicted would happen!

06:05.361 --> 06:08.396
I'm so sorry your aunt
didn't show up, Lena.

06:11.067 --> 06:12.533
It left the judge no choice.

06:12.569 --> 06:16.370
He had to look out for you and
your brothers' well-being, so...

06:16.406 --> 06:17.939
The only thing you can always depend on

06:17.974 --> 06:20.942
my aunt for is an excuse.

06:20.977 --> 06:23.377
But thank you so much for being there.

06:23.413 --> 06:25.246
I mean, thank you for everything.

06:25.281 --> 06:27.749
HankMed saved my brother's
foot, and then saved my life,

06:27.784 --> 06:29.851
and then showed up at our hearing.

06:29.886 --> 06:32.787
You guys are definitely
the most full-service

06:32.822 --> 06:34.822
medical practice ever.

06:34.858 --> 06:36.991
That's us.

06:37.026 --> 06:39.093
So...

06:39.129 --> 06:40.862
your uncle in Arizona
is taking the boys,

06:40.897 --> 06:42.964
and you will be in Boston with your...

06:42.999 --> 06:46.033
- Great Aunt Valerie.
- Right. Your great aunt...

06:48.471 --> 06:50.004
This is just until they can find someone

06:50.039 --> 06:53.341
to take care of all three of you
together, you know that, right?

06:53.376 --> 06:54.876
What?

06:54.911 --> 06:58.546
When my parents died, I
promised the boys...

06:58.581 --> 07:00.481
and myself,

07:00.517 --> 07:03.785
that nothing would ever come between us.

07:03.820 --> 07:07.588
That they'd never lose me too.

07:07.624 --> 07:09.423
Listen, you've kept that promise.

07:09.459 --> 07:11.459
- Yeah...
- Yeah, no, you have.

07:11.494 --> 07:14.729
And you'll continue to keep
it, in any way you can,

07:14.764 --> 07:18.599
in Arizona or Boston or wherever.

07:18.635 --> 07:22.603
Okay?

07:22.639 --> 07:26.407
We're gonna miss the Hamptons.

07:26.442 --> 07:28.509
Hey,

07:28.545 --> 07:30.645
why don't I take you guys
out for a send-off lunch?

07:30.680 --> 07:32.980
Maybe if I'm the last impression
you have of the Hamptons,

07:33.016 --> 07:36.284
you'll, I don't know, miss it less?

07:39.389 --> 07:43.558
I'll take that as a maybe.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.935
Excuse me, sir, I'm gonna
need to see a permit,

07:53.970 --> 07:55.503
you need to get it out now.

07:55.538 --> 07:57.772
Libby.

07:57.807 --> 08:00.007
- Hey!
- Hi!

08:00.043 --> 08:02.777
- Hi, Hank.
- Hi, what are you doing here?

08:02.812 --> 08:04.579
This is a public beach, Hank.

08:04.614 --> 08:05.880
Yeah, I know, of course...
I didn't mean...

08:05.915 --> 08:07.548
- You're welcome to...
- No!

08:07.584 --> 08:09.317
I'm saying, it's a public beach,

08:09.352 --> 08:11.252
and not everyone respects that.

08:11.287 --> 08:13.654
So I'm leading a big protest
just down the shore.

08:13.690 --> 08:15.456
What are you protesting against?

08:15.491 --> 08:18.292
There's this Wall Street
guy, Scott Figwell.

08:18.328 --> 08:19.794
Or as we like to call him, Pig-well.

08:19.829 --> 08:21.162
Oh.

08:21.197 --> 08:23.531
He's building this huge fence
on the public access path,

08:23.566 --> 08:25.266
so that he's the only one
that can use the beach.

08:25.301 --> 08:26.701
Is he allowed to do that?

08:26.703 --> 08:28.669
No, but he knows by the time
the legal process plays out,

08:28.705 --> 08:30.037
summer will be over.

08:30.073 --> 08:32.173
We're making sure that
if we don't get to

08:32.207 --> 08:33.741
enjoy the beach, he can't either.

08:33.775 --> 08:35.909
So I've got a couple
dozen people over there,

08:35.945 --> 08:37.945
and we're not moving until
he loses the fence.

08:37.981 --> 08:39.313
Nice work.

08:39.349 --> 08:41.549
So you're out on the
beach around the clock,

08:41.583 --> 08:43.217
eating and sleeping...

08:43.253 --> 08:45.453
Yep, no breaks for the
voice of the people, Hank.

08:45.488 --> 08:46.721
I appreciate that.

08:46.756 --> 08:48.289
It's just, I'm surprised someone

08:48.324 --> 08:51.959
as hygienically sensitive as
you is roughing it like that.

08:51.995 --> 08:55.196
I outgrew my hypochondria.

08:55.231 --> 08:57.965
The world has much, much
bigger problems than I do.

08:58.001 --> 09:02.470
The least I can do is my small
part of addressing them.

09:02.505 --> 09:05.573
That's a really healthy attitude, Libby.

09:05.608 --> 09:07.074
- I'm really proud of you.
- Thank you.

09:07.110 --> 09:09.210
Is Tucker a part of this movement?

09:09.245 --> 09:10.978
Like my hypochondria,

09:11.014 --> 09:12.980
it turns out Tucker was
just a bit of a phase.

09:13.016 --> 09:14.916
- Oh, I hadn't heard.
- Yeah.

09:14.951 --> 09:16.984
I really thought you guys
were one of those couples.

09:17.020 --> 09:19.186
Oh, yeah? Like you and Jill?

09:19.222 --> 09:21.022
Fair point. Fair point.

09:21.057 --> 09:23.991
It was so good to see you. I
got to go feed my troops.

09:24.027 --> 09:25.693
All right, good luck fighting the power.

09:25.728 --> 09:27.328
- Happy bonfiring.
- Thank you.

09:27.363 --> 09:30.498
- Bye!
- Bye.

09:32.969 --> 09:35.636
Hmm... Okay.

09:45.949 --> 09:48.082
Is that your ride?

09:48.117 --> 09:50.284
As soon as we're done
here, I'll be on my way.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.420
Have you considered my proposal, Hank?

09:52.455 --> 09:54.021
You mean your offer of a one-way trip

09:54.057 --> 09:55.389
to an undisclosed location,

09:55.425 --> 09:57.491
so I can keep an eye on your health?

09:57.527 --> 09:58.826
I can assure you

09:58.861 --> 10:01.629
it would be more adventurous
for you than that.

10:01.664 --> 10:03.931
Once we're there, I can
tell you everything.

10:03.967 --> 10:07.702
But until then, for my family's
safety and for your own,

10:07.737 --> 10:11.472
the less you know the better.

10:11.507 --> 10:13.941
I think your sales pitch
could use some work.

10:13.977 --> 10:16.077
Having said that, every time I discover

10:16.112 --> 10:17.311
a new part of the world with you,

10:17.347 --> 10:19.113
I also discover something
new about myself.

10:19.148 --> 10:21.849
So I'm still thinking about it.

10:25.955 --> 10:28.155
It's just some minor pain.

10:28.191 --> 10:30.691
Joint pain? How long?

10:30.727 --> 10:32.793
A couple days.

10:32.829 --> 10:35.496
It came on rather suddenly.
I'm sure it's nothing.

10:35.531 --> 10:36.864
And with anyone else,

10:36.899 --> 10:38.966
I'd chalk it up to stress
or a bad night's sleep.

10:39.002 --> 10:41.936
- Hank.
- Boris.

10:41.971 --> 10:43.838
We burn all my medical files

10:43.873 --> 10:46.107
and now you want to start a new one.

10:46.142 --> 10:48.609
I'll run some tests overnight.

11:02.090 --> 11:04.190
How'd you sleep?

11:04.225 --> 11:06.426
For some reason, once you informed me

11:06.461 --> 11:08.294
that Evan had slept in that bed,

11:08.330 --> 11:10.463
I wasn't able to find a
comfortable position.

11:12.934 --> 11:15.101
How are you feeling this morning?

11:15.136 --> 11:17.704
Headache. Maybe a fever.

11:17.739 --> 11:19.205
Hmm.

11:26.214 --> 11:29.148
Let me just take a quick look.

11:31.987 --> 11:34.320
Yeah, a slight one.

11:34.356 --> 11:35.788
But enough of one to keep me here,

11:35.824 --> 11:37.523
instead of where I want to be?

11:37.559 --> 11:39.659
Yeah. I want to do one more test.

11:39.694 --> 11:41.461
Have a seat, please.

11:47.135 --> 11:48.535
Roll up your sleeve.

11:52.173 --> 11:54.707
I got up this morning,
Hank, I was reminded

11:54.743 --> 11:56.976
of all the adventures
we've had over the years.

11:57.012 --> 11:58.277
Hmm.

11:58.313 --> 12:00.747
The Middle East, Budapest,

12:00.782 --> 12:03.683
Argentina, St. Tropez, the Caymans...

12:03.718 --> 12:06.119
You're seducing me with nostalgia?

12:06.154 --> 12:08.254
No, in your bathroom, I discovered

12:08.289 --> 12:11.290
all the hotel toiletries you've
pilfered during our travels.

12:11.326 --> 12:12.726
Huh.

12:14.329 --> 12:16.095
You've certainly earned them, though.

12:16.131 --> 12:18.564
Your skill set translated
quite successfully

12:18.600 --> 12:21.267
to everywhere we went.

12:21.302 --> 12:25.738
You seem to be as much a man
of the world as I have been.

12:25.774 --> 12:28.708
Do you plan to deflate this cuff
any time in the near future?

12:28.743 --> 12:30.043
I'm not taking your blood pressure.

12:30.078 --> 12:31.878
I'm doing a tourniquet test.

12:31.913 --> 12:33.813
All the tests I ran last
night came back negative.

12:33.848 --> 12:36.382
No sign of muscle wasting
or bone-density issues.

12:36.418 --> 12:37.450
Hank...

12:37.485 --> 12:38.518
Don't worry, I had Evan destroy

12:38.553 --> 12:39.986
all the biomaterials and records

12:40.021 --> 12:42.221
as soon as I reviewed the results.

12:42.257 --> 12:46.459
But I don't think any of this is
related to your genetic disease.

12:46.494 --> 12:48.528
What do you think it is?

12:48.563 --> 12:50.496
Is it possible you brought
Marisa and Carlos

12:50.532 --> 12:52.131
somewhere tropical?

12:52.167 --> 12:53.399
Somewhere you didn't list as part of

12:53.435 --> 12:55.334
our globetrotting
scrapbook a minute ago?

12:55.370 --> 12:58.938
Somewhere like, say... Cuba?

12:58.973 --> 13:03.142
Somewhere like it, perhaps.

13:03.178 --> 13:05.578
- And there it is.
- Good lord.

13:05.613 --> 13:08.181
I adjusted the cuff to
supply just enough pressure.

13:08.216 --> 13:12.485
These petechiae are a hallmark
of a tropical disease...

13:12.520 --> 13:14.587
dengue fever.

13:14.622 --> 13:17.457
You were probably bitten
by an infected mosquito.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.025
Dengue can be very serious,

13:19.060 --> 13:23.362
but luckily, we caught it early.

13:23.398 --> 13:26.632
You caught it early, Hank.

13:26.668 --> 13:29.001
My apologies, though...
the guesthouse will need

13:29.037 --> 13:30.837
to be scrubbed now as well, I'm afraid.

13:30.872 --> 13:32.572
It's due for a scrubbing anyway.

13:34.309 --> 13:37.110
It's perfect.

13:37.145 --> 13:39.545
Just like everything you touch.

13:39.581 --> 13:42.081
Is it gonna make the baby dizzy?

13:42.117 --> 13:44.851
I think a few previous babies
have survived the experience.

13:44.886 --> 13:46.986
Is the tiger too scary?

13:47.021 --> 13:48.321
What's happening right now?

13:48.356 --> 13:50.056
I thought I was the neurotic
Jewish mother here.

13:50.091 --> 13:52.291
What are you doing? It's fine.

13:52.327 --> 13:54.560
It's the most harmless plush
tiger I've ever seen.

13:54.596 --> 13:56.262
Whoa!

13:56.297 --> 13:58.664
I didn't know they talked.
Maybe I was wrong.

14:01.202 --> 14:03.169
So if it's a boy,

14:03.204 --> 14:08.141
I can't decide between Bill and Ted.

14:08.176 --> 14:10.510
That's a really sweet idea,

14:10.545 --> 14:13.312
to honor my dad or your grandpa.

14:13.348 --> 14:15.281
I'd actually be honoring my
favorite Keanu Reeves movie,

14:15.316 --> 14:18.951
but those too; that's great,
hadn't thought of that.

14:18.987 --> 14:21.554
And if it's a girl,

14:21.589 --> 14:25.057
how about Catherine?

14:25.093 --> 14:27.193
Mom would've loved that.

14:29.497 --> 14:32.565
Well, boy or girl,

14:32.600 --> 14:36.269
this baby is gonna be so loved.

14:36.304 --> 14:38.371
For his or her entire life.

14:42.944 --> 14:45.278
You okay?

14:45.313 --> 14:47.880
I think all children should
have that, you know?

14:47.916 --> 14:50.783
What Hank and I had until we lost it.

14:50.818 --> 14:52.785
Yeah, I agree.

14:52.820 --> 14:55.688
I really want to find a way to
help Lena and her brothers.

14:55.723 --> 14:58.057
Okay. How can we help?

14:58.092 --> 14:59.792
We could...

14:59.827 --> 15:01.894
foster them... temporarily.

15:01.930 --> 15:03.029
You want...

15:03.064 --> 15:05.131
Until they find another solution.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.966
Look, I have no idea where
we'd put three extra kids.

15:07.001 --> 15:09.535
I know, but...

15:09.571 --> 15:11.470
It just came to me like a vision,

15:11.506 --> 15:13.472
and I can't stop thinking about it.

15:13.508 --> 15:16.576
That's a lot of responsibility, Evan.

15:16.611 --> 15:17.710
I know.

15:17.745 --> 15:18.878
I don't know how to handle one kid,

15:18.913 --> 15:20.479
let alone four

15:20.515 --> 15:22.415
and all the different ages.

15:22.450 --> 15:25.351
I know, look, I'm not
gonna push this on you

15:25.386 --> 15:29.155
if it feels like too much.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.591
Yeah.

15:33.728 --> 15:37.530
What? What are you thinking about?

15:37.565 --> 15:39.865
About what would've happened if...

15:39.901 --> 15:42.134
my parents felt like adopting me

15:42.170 --> 15:44.070
would have been too much.

15:50.378 --> 15:53.179
You know, I think meeting these kids

15:53.214 --> 15:55.248
would be a really good first step.

15:55.283 --> 15:57.283
I totally agree,

15:57.318 --> 15:59.785
which is why I already set
up a lunch for all of us.

15:59.821 --> 16:02.154
Oh, you did?

16:02.190 --> 16:04.056
Yeah.

16:13.234 --> 16:16.002
Am I behind schedule?

16:17.772 --> 16:21.807
Boris, I'm flattered by your offer,

16:21.843 --> 16:24.110
but I can't go with you.

16:24.145 --> 16:25.411
I see.

16:25.446 --> 16:26.879
I need a change,

16:26.914 --> 16:28.414
but I don't think I'll accomplish that

16:28.449 --> 16:30.616
by following your path.

16:30.652 --> 16:32.752
I need to find my own.

16:34.756 --> 16:37.123
That is understandable.

16:39.127 --> 16:41.961
You know, when I was going
through your files,

16:41.996 --> 16:44.030
I saw all the Russians
in your family history,

16:44.065 --> 16:47.233
and I realized that they
traced back to the czars.

16:47.268 --> 16:49.335
I'm guessing these oligarchs
want to prove that,

16:49.370 --> 16:52.772
so they can use you to take power.

16:52.807 --> 16:55.041
And these Russians, they
don't want you dead,

16:55.076 --> 16:57.276
they want you in charge.

16:57.312 --> 16:59.645
You're Russian royalty, aren't you?

17:03.284 --> 17:05.550
You pieced that all together, did you?

17:07.555 --> 17:11.790
I'm not opposed to intervening
in Russia's destiny,

17:11.826 --> 17:15.728
but if I do, it will be
at a time of my choosing.

17:15.762 --> 17:19.598
Will you make sure that Evan gets this?

17:19.634 --> 17:22.101
Yeah. Of course.

17:22.136 --> 17:25.404
You sure I can't convince you
to stay another couple of days?

17:25.440 --> 17:28.007
You said I need supportive care.

17:28.041 --> 17:29.575
That's right.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.844
I shall have a large staff

17:31.879 --> 17:34.747
and a wife who is a
world-renowned physician.

17:34.782 --> 17:36.248
Fair enough.

17:36.284 --> 17:38.718
In fact, that's why I know
you don't really need me

17:38.753 --> 17:41.520
down there with you at all.

17:41.556 --> 17:44.857
I wasn't inviting you
along as my doctor, Hank.

17:44.892 --> 17:46.559
You've already healed me

17:46.594 --> 17:49.128
in more ways than I could ask for.

17:49.163 --> 17:51.530
I invited you...

17:51.566 --> 17:53.199
as a part of my family.

17:57.438 --> 17:58.971
In a large part, thanks to you,

17:59.006 --> 18:03.109
I now have a great deal of
what I want in my life.

18:05.913 --> 18:08.013
And I wish you the best
in finding the same.

18:08.049 --> 18:09.281
Yeah?

18:09.317 --> 18:11.851
Thank you, Boris.

18:11.886 --> 18:15.354
For everything.

18:15.390 --> 18:17.490
No, no.

19:05.841 --> 19:08.097
And Jeremiah, you can handle Ms.
Newberg's physical?

19:08.122 --> 19:09.522
Of course.

19:09.890 --> 19:11.890
Great.

19:11.925 --> 19:14.826
Okay.

19:14.862 --> 19:18.130
I think that about does it.

19:23.604 --> 19:26.038
Wow.

19:26.073 --> 19:28.240
I can't believe it.

19:28.382 --> 19:30.048
Your final staff meeting is over.

19:30.084 --> 19:31.650
Final staff meeting for now.

19:31.685 --> 19:33.018
That's right.

19:33.053 --> 19:34.820
One day you'll be back at
this table, as Dr. Divs.

19:34.855 --> 19:38.123
I really look forward to that.

19:38.159 --> 19:39.559
Should I break out the bubbly?

19:39.560 --> 19:41.593
Honestly, if I have another
glass of apple cider,

19:41.629 --> 19:44.229
I might need to punch something.

19:44.265 --> 19:45.864
I totally get it.

19:45.900 --> 19:49.601
Hey, we can just enjoy the moment.

19:49.637 --> 19:51.303
I just...

19:51.338 --> 19:54.006
I can't believe you're
actually leaving the Hamptons.

19:54.041 --> 19:55.641
I know.

19:55.676 --> 19:57.776
I couldn't have done it without
your encouragement, Hank.

19:57.811 --> 20:00.045
- That's ironic, isn't it?
- What is?

20:00.080 --> 20:02.214
I'm responsible for you
settling in the Hamptons,

20:02.249 --> 20:05.584
and you're responsible for me leaving.

20:05.619 --> 20:07.286
Sorry, just to clarify, by "ironic",

20:07.321 --> 20:08.554
did you mean utterly incorrect?

20:08.589 --> 20:09.888
And here we go.

20:09.924 --> 20:10.889
I don't think that's a commonly used

20:10.925 --> 20:12.257
definition of the word.

20:12.293 --> 20:13.926
I'm sorry, what part of that
was "utterly incorrect"?

20:13.961 --> 20:15.627
Okay, I think we all know

20:15.663 --> 20:17.162
that Hank ended up here because of me.

20:17.198 --> 20:19.364
I'm sure we can find
more interesting things

20:19.400 --> 20:20.599
to compete over.

20:20.634 --> 20:22.034
I'm just saying,

20:22.036 --> 20:23.302
I picked him up off the floor
of that dump in Brooklyn,

20:23.337 --> 20:25.237
forced him into that
green Swedish rickshaw,

20:25.272 --> 20:26.872
and dragged his ass
all the way out here.

20:26.907 --> 20:28.507
And I pitched a little business idea

20:28.542 --> 20:30.576
that gave him and you a
reason to stay out here.

20:30.611 --> 20:32.644
And really, isn't there
enough credit to go around?

20:32.680 --> 20:33.879
You know what?

20:33.914 --> 20:35.414
Shared credit defeats the
whole purpose of credit.

20:35.449 --> 20:36.882
Oh, that's a healthy perspective.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.818
I refuse to be the co-creator
of HankMed, that's all.

20:39.853 --> 20:41.920
Ladies and gentlemen, my husband.

20:41.956 --> 20:43.088
Okay, the point...

20:43.123 --> 20:44.790
The point, Divya, is that no matter

20:44.825 --> 20:46.491
who brought us all together,

20:46.527 --> 20:49.728
we'll never be the same without you.

20:49.763 --> 20:52.998
Okay, maybe one glass of apple cider.

20:53.033 --> 20:55.033
You got it. Just don't punch me.

21:01.742 --> 21:04.776
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

21:04.812 --> 21:07.379
- Cider.
- Thank you.

21:07.414 --> 21:10.415
And to Divya.

21:10.451 --> 21:14.186
From the moment we met, you
have always irritated...

21:14.221 --> 21:16.455
I mean, challenged me.

21:16.490 --> 21:17.689
But you have.

21:17.725 --> 21:21.193
You've always forced
me to raise my game,

21:21.228 --> 21:23.562
and... I can't believe
I'm gonna actually

21:23.597 --> 21:25.397
admit this to your face...

21:25.432 --> 21:27.165
I look up to you.

21:27.201 --> 21:31.837
Your tough love helped me grow up.

21:31.872 --> 21:35.173
Without you, I don't know
who I would've become.

21:35.209 --> 21:36.742
I don't even know if I
would've found Paige.

21:36.777 --> 21:38.944
So...

21:38.979 --> 21:40.679
yeah, thanks, Divs.

21:40.714 --> 21:43.315
Without you, I wouldn't be...

21:45.252 --> 21:47.386
Evan R. Lawson, CFO of HankMed,

21:47.421 --> 21:50.622
husband, hospital administrator,

21:50.658 --> 21:53.892
and pillar of the community.

21:53.927 --> 21:57.262
Okay, I'm not sure if that toast
was to me or to yourself,

21:57.298 --> 22:00.632
but, uh, thanks, sidekick.

22:06.006 --> 22:08.173
To Divya.

22:08.208 --> 22:11.376
I know I don't have the history
with you that these guys do,

22:11.412 --> 22:13.445
but I think we've done
a really great job

22:13.480 --> 22:15.847
making up for lost time.

22:15.883 --> 22:19.584
Thank you for being such a caring friend

22:19.620 --> 22:23.588
and for doing such a good
job raising my husband.

22:33.567 --> 22:36.001
To Divya.

22:36.036 --> 22:39.271
Do you remember me on
the day we first met?

22:39.306 --> 22:41.273
It was right over there.

22:41.308 --> 22:43.875
Of course I do.

22:43.911 --> 22:45.510
I think the first thing
you said to me was

22:45.546 --> 22:49.314
I had an unusually symmetrical face.

22:49.350 --> 22:52.451
Well...

22:52.486 --> 22:55.520
look at me now.

22:57.558 --> 22:59.091
I will never forget

22:59.126 --> 23:02.861
how you helped me get here.

23:02.896 --> 23:04.429
Thank you.

23:13.974 --> 23:17.676
To Divya,

23:17.711 --> 23:20.846
the sibling I always wished I had.

23:20.881 --> 23:22.147
Relax, I'm kidding.

23:22.182 --> 23:24.983
Mostly.

23:25.018 --> 23:28.387
You changed my life in so many ways

23:28.422 --> 23:31.189
and you did give me a
reason to stay out here,

23:31.225 --> 23:35.360
but it wasn't just HankMed.

23:35.396 --> 23:38.997
It was the chance to
have a family again,

23:39.032 --> 23:41.867
and for that, I am more grateful

23:41.902 --> 23:44.569
than you will ever know.

23:44.605 --> 23:46.171
So go.

23:46.206 --> 23:49.341
You go get that Johns Hopkins
MD, and you bring it back.

23:49.376 --> 23:51.309
The Hamptons will be anxiously awaiting

23:51.345 --> 23:52.511
your return,

23:52.546 --> 23:56.915
and so will we.

23:56.950 --> 23:59.851
To Divya.

23:59.887 --> 24:01.887
To Divya.

24:04.525 --> 24:06.992
Okay, so...

24:07.027 --> 24:10.228
I think that I'm about ready
for a big HankMed hug

24:10.264 --> 24:11.296
right about now.

24:11.331 --> 24:12.898
Let's do it!

24:22.276 --> 24:24.976
Just of curiosity, how long
do these typically last?

24:27.181 --> 24:29.281
It's over, big guy.

24:29.316 --> 24:32.584
- We love you, Divs.
- Love you too.

24:38.926 --> 24:42.060
And then she finally bought
us our own cell phones.

24:42.095 --> 24:45.931
Which is why I know that when
it comes to FaceTiming me

24:45.966 --> 24:49.301
every single day, I'll be
able to count on Wes and Ian.

24:49.336 --> 24:51.069
Not necessarily in that order.

24:55.843 --> 24:57.742
So, uh...

24:57.778 --> 24:59.377
Hey, fellas, have you noticed

24:59.413 --> 25:01.480
the motorized boats in
the pond right there?

25:01.515 --> 25:04.783
- Lena, we're going boating.
- Yep. See you.

25:04.818 --> 25:06.751
Boat safely.

25:10.190 --> 25:13.258
So...

25:13.293 --> 25:17.195
we're sorry we couldn't be
more helpful with the court.

25:17.231 --> 25:18.631
You know, the truth is, we couldn't have

25:18.632 --> 25:21.333
kept things up the way they were.

25:21.368 --> 25:23.768
I mean, I couldn't have.

25:23.804 --> 25:27.506
It was just too much to handle,
without some serious help.

25:29.076 --> 25:31.776
Well, we're glad you put it that way.

25:31.812 --> 25:34.079
Lena, how would you feel about...

25:34.114 --> 25:36.381
staying with us for a while?

25:36.416 --> 25:39.818
All of you.

25:39.853 --> 25:41.286
We could foster you.

25:41.321 --> 25:42.621
On a trial basis,

25:42.656 --> 25:46.224
just to see how it works for everyone.

25:46.260 --> 25:47.492
But isn't it too late for...

25:47.528 --> 25:49.694
We already spoke to the social worker,

25:49.730 --> 25:54.165
and she wants to help us make this work.

25:54.201 --> 25:55.667
But you guys barely know us.

25:55.702 --> 25:57.469
Why would you want to
do something like that?

25:57.504 --> 25:59.437
So that you can keep
your family together.

25:59.473 --> 26:00.805
Yeah.

26:00.841 --> 26:03.608
We just wanna offer you some...

26:03.644 --> 26:05.744
serious help.

26:05.779 --> 26:09.381
Full disclosure, our house
is definitely not huge,

26:09.416 --> 26:10.949
and Paige is pregnant.

26:10.984 --> 26:12.884
- Oh, my gosh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.052
So it might get a bit crowded...

26:14.087 --> 26:18.456
- Cozy. He means cozy.
- Right, yes. Cozy.

26:18.492 --> 26:20.492
But we're excited to make it work.

26:20.527 --> 26:24.596
That is, if you're interested.

26:24.631 --> 26:28.700
I need $10, please. Thank you.

26:28.735 --> 26:31.937
Hey, what'd you say to my sister?

26:33.707 --> 26:36.107
Why don't you grab Wes,

26:36.143 --> 26:37.943
and I'll tell you.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.905
Wow.

26:47.941 --> 26:49.373
And Paige is on board?

26:49.409 --> 26:50.875
100%.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.310
She spent an hour with those kids,

26:52.345 --> 26:54.312
and now she wants to help
them as much as I do.

26:54.347 --> 26:56.681
She also sees it as a chance
to show her gratitude,

26:56.716 --> 26:59.550
for finally being given
a child of our own.

26:59.586 --> 27:02.053
That totally makes sense.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.722
Yeah, I see it as a chance to
show my gratitude for you.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.328
- For me?
- Yeah.

27:10.363 --> 27:12.597
You weren't just my brother,

27:12.632 --> 27:15.433
or my surrogate parent,
or my best friend.

27:15.468 --> 27:18.302
You know, you were those
things too, but...

27:18.338 --> 27:21.606
You were the glue, you know?

27:21.641 --> 27:24.208
And now Paige and I get to
be the glue for these kids.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.111
And just when I thought

27:27.147 --> 27:29.380
I couldn't be any prouder of my brother.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.949
I need to quit HankMed...

27:31.985 --> 27:34.552
for good.

27:34.587 --> 27:36.587
I've been juggling so
many things, Henry.

27:36.623 --> 27:38.856
I can't do it anymore.

27:38.892 --> 27:41.526
I need to focus on my
family and these kids

27:41.561 --> 27:45.663
and the hospital as best as I can.

27:45.698 --> 27:47.965
I think it's the right call, Ev,

27:48.001 --> 27:51.269
and I totally support you.

27:51.304 --> 27:53.871
Yeah.

27:53.907 --> 27:56.274
It's time to put HankMed to bed.

27:59.212 --> 28:01.412
Why don't you come help me?

28:01.447 --> 28:03.214
I can't believe I didn't
think of this before.

28:03.249 --> 28:06.684
Henry, come run the ER full-time.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.953
I know the last time we tried
it, I stepped on your toes,

28:08.988 --> 28:10.454
and you nearly poked my eye out,

28:10.490 --> 28:12.223
but I promise you... I swear, this time

28:12.258 --> 28:13.658
you'd have complete autonomy.

28:13.660 --> 28:16.627
It would be your ER.

28:16.663 --> 28:18.429
That's quite an idea.

28:18.464 --> 28:22.633
So?

28:22.669 --> 28:27.605
It might be the kind of
change I'm looking for.

28:27.640 --> 28:32.043
Yeah, look, I'll... I'll think about it.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.911
Oh, that reminds me.

28:33.947 --> 28:36.514
Boris wanted me to give you this.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.149
It's probably another list of tasks

28:38.184 --> 28:39.917
he needs me to tend to in his absence.

28:39.953 --> 28:41.919
I don't know why he doesn't
just e-mail me this stuff.

28:41.955 --> 28:43.821
He's old-school.

28:43.857 --> 28:45.189
- You want to hear it?
- I do.

28:45.225 --> 28:46.858
They're really boring.

28:49.762 --> 28:52.196
"I hereby donate use
of my personal estate,

28:52.232 --> 28:53.831
"Shadow Pond, and its staff,

28:53.867 --> 28:56.167
to Hamptons Heritage Hospital."

28:56.202 --> 28:58.035
What?

28:58.071 --> 29:00.571
"Specifically, it is to become
the permanent residence

29:00.607 --> 29:02.340
"of the hospital...

29:02.375 --> 29:05.109
"administrator,

29:05.144 --> 29:07.078
"to be used as he or she sees fit,

29:07.113 --> 29:09.580
"without any restrictions
or obligations, whatsoever.

29:09.616 --> 29:11.048
"Effective immediately.

29:11.084 --> 29:13.684
Signed, BKVJR."

29:16.589 --> 29:17.722
Would you excuse me for one second?

29:17.757 --> 29:19.991
Uh, yeah.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.861
It's mine!

29:23.897 --> 29:25.162
It's all mine!

29:25.198 --> 29:26.163
It's mine!

29:28.234 --> 29:30.635
It's mine!

29:35.808 --> 29:37.942
So you're telling me that all
of this is at Evan's disposal?

29:37.977 --> 29:39.110
I saw it in writing,

29:39.145 --> 29:40.444
or I wouldn't have believed it myself.

29:41.614 --> 29:43.014
Our first time at Shadow Pond,

29:43.016 --> 29:45.316
he literally had to scam his
way through the front door,

29:45.351 --> 29:47.018
and now he's got the run of the place.

29:47.053 --> 29:48.920
- God bless America.
- Yeah.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.488
I really hope he doesn't
rename the estate

29:50.523 --> 29:51.489
in his own honor.

29:51.524 --> 29:53.491
Oh, gosh, Shadow Evan.

29:53.526 --> 29:56.894
Or Evan R. Lawson, CFO of HankMed Pond.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.601
So no more HankMed at all?

30:03.636 --> 30:05.937
- No more HankMed at all.
- That's crazy.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.806
I know.

30:08.841 --> 30:11.509
What's next for you then?

30:11.544 --> 30:13.344
No idea yet.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.046
I'm considering a few different options,

30:15.081 --> 30:16.881
but this isn't just about
finding a new title,

30:16.916 --> 30:19.050
or a new way to practice medicine.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.185
I realized...

30:21.220 --> 30:24.388
I need to find a new way to live.

30:24.424 --> 30:25.656
Okay...

30:25.692 --> 30:27.158
Out of curiosity, what's
wrong with the way

30:27.193 --> 30:28.159
you've been doing it?

30:28.194 --> 30:30.428
Nothing at all.

30:30.463 --> 30:34.432
I wouldn't trade the past
few years for anything.

30:34.467 --> 30:37.268
And this whole summer, I thought I was

30:37.303 --> 30:39.503
finally getting ready
to put down my roots,

30:39.539 --> 30:43.874
and settle down here, but the truth is,

30:43.910 --> 30:46.210
I don't feel like I'm settling down.

30:46.245 --> 30:50.748
I'm afraid I may just be settling.

30:50.783 --> 30:52.483
I look around at the
people I care about,

30:52.518 --> 30:54.719
and they have everything they want.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.959
I don't.

31:01.995 --> 31:04.495
Not yet.

31:06.132 --> 31:08.432
Hank,

31:08.468 --> 31:11.502
you know that Evan and I
were being silly before,

31:11.537 --> 31:14.305
arguing over who gave you a
reason to become a Hamptonite.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.340
Oh, yeah, of course I know.

31:16.376 --> 31:20.011
The truth is, I know
you found that reason

31:20.046 --> 31:23.214
somewhere inside of you.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.583
Whatever you end up doing next,

31:25.618 --> 31:28.386
you'll find that reason
inside of you too.

31:30.690 --> 31:32.223
I know it.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.181
Hey, Jim.

32:31.851 --> 32:33.918
Lena, Wes, Ian,

32:33.953 --> 32:36.087
welcome to Shadow Pond.

32:36.122 --> 32:39.056
- Holy sh...
- Shh! Ian!

32:39.092 --> 32:40.724
I bet you they have servants.

32:40.760 --> 32:43.127
I'll challenge that.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.995
I told you!

32:51.104 --> 32:53.104
Hey, if you have a few free hours,

32:53.139 --> 32:55.940
I could give you the grand tour.

32:55.975 --> 32:58.342
We can start with your walk-in closet.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.148
First Boris disappears off
the face of the earth,

33:04.183 --> 33:05.349
and now you?

33:05.384 --> 33:07.451
I'm not disappearing off
the face of the earth.

33:07.487 --> 33:10.121
I'm just heading to a
different part of it.

33:12.692 --> 33:15.226
Ev,

33:15.261 --> 33:18.729
I'll never disappear on you,

33:18.764 --> 33:22.032
but I know this is what
I need to do right now.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.602
What I want to do.

33:24.637 --> 33:26.370
I'm ready for a new challenge.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.309
I don't love this...

33:36.082 --> 33:39.016
But I support it 'cause I love you.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.255
I love you too, Ev.

33:44.290 --> 33:47.825
And I love what we did
together out here.

33:47.860 --> 33:51.462
All the people HankMed helped.

33:51.497 --> 33:55.166
Including me.

33:55.201 --> 33:58.135
And me.

33:58.171 --> 34:00.371
And us.

34:04.143 --> 34:06.377
Do you know what "Air Force One" is?

34:06.412 --> 34:09.013
It's the 747 the president uses?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.246
That's what everyone thinks it is.

34:10.283 --> 34:11.415
It's actually the call sign

34:11.449 --> 34:13.217
for whatever plane is
carrying the president

34:13.252 --> 34:14.818
at any given moment.

34:14.853 --> 34:16.554
I learned that when I was
convinced that someday,

34:16.589 --> 34:18.054
I'd be asked to run.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.657
Yeah, um, where we going with this, Ev?

34:21.027 --> 34:24.562
HankMed isn't a business
in the Hamptons.

34:24.597 --> 34:27.498
It's a calling. It's your calling.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.466
One you'll answer, wherever you are,

34:29.502 --> 34:31.034
at any given moment.

34:31.070 --> 34:34.103
So...

34:34.139 --> 34:37.274
HankMed will continue,

34:37.310 --> 34:40.911
uninterrupted.

34:40.947 --> 34:42.713
Speaking of planes, you
need a ride to the airport?

34:42.748 --> 34:44.648
Well, I just called an Uber, but...

34:44.684 --> 34:46.083
Oh, thank God. Safe travels, bro.

36:12.038 --> 36:14.705
Hank!

36:14.740 --> 36:16.807
Hi!

36:20.212 --> 36:21.979
Wha...

36:22.014 --> 36:24.248
You finally come visit,
you didn't even call?

36:26.519 --> 36:29.186
I'm not here for just a visit.

36:29.221 --> 36:33.123
Divya was right, but
the reason I stayed...

36:33.159 --> 36:36.894
the reason... was you.

36:36.929 --> 36:38.729
And not just because you
understood the Hamptons

36:38.764 --> 36:41.965
but because you understood me

36:42.001 --> 36:45.102
from the moment we met.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.872
The moment we met was you confusing

36:48.908 --> 36:51.241
my olive-green Saab for yours.

36:52.378 --> 36:53.944
You see, it was destiny from the start.

36:56.882 --> 37:00.617
I know when you left I had
no choice but to let you go.

37:00.653 --> 37:03.721
I knew I had to go,

37:03.756 --> 37:06.423
but, Hank, it was so hard

37:06.459 --> 37:08.525
to walk away from what we had,

37:08.561 --> 37:12.463
but what we had it just...

37:12.498 --> 37:13.964
kept getting interrupted

37:13.999 --> 37:15.833
by our jobs,

37:15.868 --> 37:17.568
our exes, our families...

37:17.603 --> 37:21.205
I know. I know.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.673
But I'm ready

37:22.708 --> 37:26.143
to not let anything interrupt us, Jill,

37:26.178 --> 37:30.013
and I guess I came
here to find out if...

37:30.049 --> 37:31.648
if you are too.

37:38.824 --> 37:42.192
How do we...

37:53.666 --> 37:55.361
- Look, Mommy, look!
- _

37:55.392 --> 37:57.659
Yeah, look at you in the truck.

37:57.694 --> 37:58.860
Good job!

38:06.903 --> 38:08.837
Who keeps turning the music up?

38:08.872 --> 38:11.039
Who taught you to cook?

38:14.077 --> 38:15.743
Oh, you're so gonna get it!

38:15.779 --> 38:17.846
Babe, your phone!

38:17.881 --> 38:19.180
Uh, can you grab it, please?

38:19.216 --> 38:21.382
Um, I'm a little busy
with the other two things

38:21.418 --> 38:23.184
you asked me to handle!

38:23.220 --> 38:24.620
That's an amazing excuse.

38:24.654 --> 38:27.088
Next time.

38:28.758 --> 38:30.024
Come here!

38:45.642 --> 38:47.108
Hey.

38:47.143 --> 38:49.210
- Table's set.
- Food is almost done.

38:49.246 --> 38:51.980
Good.

38:53.450 --> 38:55.917
It's always nice to be back
for Memorial Day weekend.

38:55.952 --> 38:57.252
Yeah...

38:57.287 --> 38:59.287
now, who would have thought
the Hamptons would become

38:59.322 --> 39:00.788
our summer getaway?

39:00.824 --> 39:02.557
Hey, I was always just crashing.

39:02.592 --> 39:04.926
You're the down-to-earth native.

39:04.961 --> 39:06.528
Honey, you don't have to sweet talk me.

39:06.563 --> 39:08.229
I already said yes.

39:08.265 --> 39:10.265
You ain't seen nothing yet.

39:17.474 --> 39:19.440
No. It doesn't matter.

39:19.476 --> 39:20.642
You don't have to bring anything.

39:20.677 --> 39:23.144
No, we don't need baklava.

39:23.179 --> 39:26.014
Just get here. Bye.

39:26.049 --> 39:28.383
Dad and Newberg are almost here.

39:28.418 --> 39:29.884
Oh, an hour late.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.787
That's early for Dad.

39:34.791 --> 39:37.058
It's nice having you back again.

39:37.093 --> 39:38.393
For the summer.

39:38.428 --> 39:40.662
It's very nice to be back again.

39:40.697 --> 39:42.797
For the summer.

39:42.832 --> 39:44.265
Ian wants to know if his Uncle Hank

39:44.301 --> 39:46.167
can teach him how to play basketball.

39:48.905 --> 39:50.638
What?

39:50.674 --> 39:51.906
You know how long it's been

39:51.942 --> 39:55.510
since I stepped onto a basketball court?

39:55.545 --> 39:57.512
I know exactly how long.

39:57.547 --> 39:59.314
Yeah.

40:04.854 --> 40:06.654
I'm looking forward to this summer.

40:06.690 --> 40:08.456
It's gonna be fun,

40:08.491 --> 40:10.992
all of us saddling up together.

40:11.027 --> 40:13.761
So what's on tap for
HankMed tomorrow morning?

40:13.797 --> 40:15.430
We have an author with arthritis,

40:15.465 --> 40:16.731
and a waitress with carpal tunnel.

40:16.766 --> 40:19.367
- Where do you want to start?
- Hmm.

40:21.037 --> 40:23.104
- I'd like to start with Ian.
- Hmm?

40:23.139 --> 40:26.908
On the courts by Cooper's Beach.

40:26.943 --> 40:29.344
Okay then.

40:29.379 --> 40:31.412
While you're doing that,
Divya can see the author,

40:31.448 --> 40:34.115
and Jeremiah can treat the waitress.

40:34.150 --> 40:37.285
Done, done,

40:37.320 --> 40:41.055
and done.

40:43.727 --> 40:44.993
Let's eat, guys.

40:52.569 --> 40:54.636
- Okay, who wants a hot dog?
- I do!

40:55.305 --> 41:01.476
