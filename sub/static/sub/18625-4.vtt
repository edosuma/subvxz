[Blinky]
<i>For centuries, the troll and human worlds</i>

00:48.966 --> 00:50.759
<i>stood separate and at peace,</i>

00:50.842 --> 00:55.138
<i>divided by bridges that acted</i>
<i>as doorways between our two realms.</i>

00:55.222 --> 00:59.017
<i>But the Gumm-Gumms wanted</i>
<i>to devour all of mankind.</i>

00:59.101 --> 01:01.728
<i>They were led by Gunmar "the Black."</i>

01:01.812 --> 01:04.230
<i>The rest of trollkind fought against him,</i>

01:04.313 --> 01:06.733
<i>culminating in the great</i>
<i>Battle of Killahead Bridge,</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:09.736
<i>the portal to Gunmar's Darklands.</i>

01:09.820 --> 01:13.407
<i>After many moons,</i>
<i>good triumphed over evil,</i>

01:13.490 --> 01:17.619
<i>and our great Trollhunter,</i>
<i>Deya "the Deliverer," locked Gunmar away,</i>

01:17.703 --> 01:19.913
<i>exiling him to the Darklands,</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:22.874
<i>and sealed the Killahead Bridge</i>
<i>with the sacred amulet.</i>

01:22.958 --> 01:26.336
<i>After, we tore it apart, stone by stone.</i>

01:26.420 --> 01:29.256
<i>We left the old world</i>
<i>in search for peace.</i>

01:29.339 --> 01:31.508
<i>We stowed away on a ship</i>
<i>called the Mayflower,</i>

01:31.591 --> 01:34.720
<i>just a handful of us and some gnomes</i>
<i>we'd brought along for companionship</i>

01:34.803 --> 01:36.221
<i>and nourishment.</i>

01:36.305 --> 01:39.391
<i>Finally, we arrived</i>
<i>in a strange and exotic realm.</i>

01:39.474 --> 01:41.059
[Aaarrrgghh]
<i>New Jersey.</i>

01:41.143 --> 01:42.769
[Blinky]
<i>We kept walking.</i>

01:42.853 --> 01:45.272
<i>Eventually, we came across</i>
<i>a new Heartstone,</i>

01:45.355 --> 01:49.359
<i>and we realized we had found</i>
<i>a new home... under Arcadia.</i>

01:51.695 --> 01:52.738
[groans]

01:52.821 --> 01:54.948
[snoring]

01:55.032 --> 01:58.327
<i>¡Lo siento, Señor Draal!</i>
<i>¡No me mates!</i>

01:58.410 --> 02:02.039
The training of troll history might seem
like a minor duty, Master Jim, but--

02:02.122 --> 02:05.459
Sorry, I pulled an all-nighter studying
for my Spanish Comprehension exam

02:05.542 --> 02:07.002
and my brain is <i>muy</i> gooey.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.464
I don't know. I guess I thought
if I'm facing Draal in a week,

02:10.547 --> 02:13.592
my training would be
a little more... active.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.887
Yeah, like, when is he going to learn
Troll-kwondo? Or Rock-itsu?

02:16.970 --> 02:20.974
Before one fights, Toby D.,
one must understand why one fights.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.518
For these precious early steps will decide

02:23.602 --> 02:27.981
whether a young Trollhunter will become
a Deya "the Deliverer"...

02:28.440 --> 02:30.734
[Aaarrrgghh]
Or Unkar "the Unfortunate."

02:32.611 --> 02:37.074
Well, tomorrow, my Spanish exam
is with <i>Señor</i> Uhl "the Unforgiving."

02:37.157 --> 02:40.285
My main concern is
for my immediate future.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.788
A-ha! But, to learn
what will happen in the future,

02:42.871 --> 02:44.998
one must only look to the past.

02:45.082 --> 02:49.211
I recommend <i>A Brief Recapitulation</i>
<i>of Troll Lore</i> by the venerable Bedehilde.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.463
Volume one of 47.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.799
Okay, but if I don't pass the exam,

02:53.882 --> 02:57.219
I'm grounded
and I can't be the Trollhunter.

02:57.302 --> 03:02.265
Sorry, Blinky, but the amulet chose me,
and now I have two lives to keep up.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.392
[panting]

03:03.475 --> 03:05.894
-Oh, no. Is it the Heartstone?
-No! No!

03:05.977 --> 03:08.230
-Stalkling?
-Is Bular in Trollmarket?

03:08.313 --> 03:13.026
No! Gnome! Rogue gnome!

03:13.110 --> 03:15.654
[voice echoing]

03:16.530 --> 03:18.865
[male voice]
Get your toasters here!

03:18.949 --> 03:22.244
First, I couldn't find my monocle,
then my collection of bed coils.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.746
Now, something disappears every minute!

03:25.664 --> 03:28.083
-[gnome giggles]
-Ah, yes. Gnome.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.293
Oh, dirty little pests.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.880
Up to last week,
the glue traps were working fine.

03:35.590 --> 03:39.386
-Fix it, Trollhunter!
-Uh, yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.807
See, you need a gnome-catcher,
and I'm, well, the Trollhunter, so--

03:43.890 --> 03:47.394
Oh, no, Master Jim.
The Trollhunter cannot refuse the call.

03:47.477 --> 03:51.022
And what better a call for you
to train with than a pint-sized quarry?

03:51.106 --> 03:54.192
[rapid footsteps, guitar playing]

03:54.276 --> 03:56.027
[clears throat]

03:58.071 --> 04:00.198
[vocalizes, laughs]

04:00.282 --> 04:03.034
He's trying to distract us!
Hold tight to your valuables.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.954
Why? [chuckles]
He can't be that bad.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.874
-[gnome giggling]
-Oh, no! My belt!

04:09.541 --> 04:12.419
At least he didn't take
my Nougat Nummy. [gasps]

04:12.502 --> 04:14.963
-We need to catch that gnome.
-[gnome laughing]

04:15.046 --> 04:16.923
-Over there!
-Oh! Over there!

04:17.007 --> 04:18.591
No! Over here!

04:18.675 --> 04:19.968
Right here.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.974
[chattering incoherently]

04:27.184 --> 04:29.227
-[laughing]
-[groans]

04:29.311 --> 04:32.355
Oh, my beautiful saw! Catch him!

04:34.441 --> 04:36.568
-[chattering]
-[grunts]

04:36.651 --> 04:38.153
-[yells]
-[gasps]

04:40.155 --> 04:41.531
[grunts]

04:41.823 --> 04:42.741
Pacifist.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.954
-Oh, no. Where's the amulet?
-[gnome whizzes by]

04:48.038 --> 04:50.123
-[laughing]
-Oh, no!

04:54.961 --> 04:57.506
-[laughter echoing]
-Hole.

04:58.256 --> 05:02.344
Yes, it appears the plot
quite literally deepens.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.930
Come back, come back.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.767
Shouldn't the amulet be coming
back to me right about now?

05:08.850 --> 05:12.354
Dolefully, that rule only applies
if you've rejected it.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.231
When thieved, it's another story.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.609
If you had read <i>A Brief Recapitulation</i>,
you would have known that.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.403
[sighs]
Some Trollhunter you are.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.405
Jim "the Baby-Handed."

05:22.489 --> 05:25.617
Master Jim, press on.
This is not the moniker you want.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.370
What else can I do?
I can't fit in that hole.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.081
-Hmm, currently.
-Bad idea.

05:31.164 --> 05:35.418
No Trollhunter has ever lost his amulet.
We'll need time to procure the Furgolator.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.671
Uh, the Furgolator?

05:37.754 --> 05:40.090
Uh, don't you worry
about anything, Master Jim.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.342
Tend to your studies.
We'll watch over the hole.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.720
Tomorrow, you'll return refreshed
to deal with this, uh...

05:45.804 --> 05:47.430
[chuckles] little problem.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.015
[chalk screeching]

05:49.099 --> 05:53.353
"Little did anyone know,
Maria was juggling two <i>hombres.</i>

05:54.145 --> 05:59.651
Manolo was <i>muy guapo</i>,
but Joaquin had <i>muchos musculos.</i>"

05:59.734 --> 06:04.114
[whispering] You broke my tooth.
I'm going to break your life.

06:04.197 --> 06:08.660
When I'm through with you, you're going
to wish you were dead. [laughs]

06:10.870 --> 06:14.249
[girl]
"And poor Maria had a <i>pedoso</i> heart."

06:15.292 --> 06:18.295
[German accent] What kind of heart
did Maria have, Miss Wang?

06:18.378 --> 06:24.134
Uh, a heavy heart.
"<i>Pe-do-so.</i>" Or is it--

06:24.217 --> 06:26.970
I would hope Maria wouldn't have
a <i>pedoso</i> heart,

06:27.053 --> 06:28.763
because that would mean "gassy."

06:28.847 --> 06:31.600
Did Maria have a gassy heart, Miss Wang?

06:31.683 --> 06:34.352
Of course not, <i>Señor</i> Uhl!

06:34.436 --> 06:38.356
Uh-buh-bum! You were trying
to say "<i>pesado.</i>" "A heavy heart."

06:38.440 --> 06:41.234
And it is with a heavy heart,
Miss Wang, to tell you

06:41.318 --> 06:45.322
you have not shown the slightest
comprehension of the basic Spanish.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.159
If you can't even finish the exam,
I have no choice but to fail you.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.413
-[sobbing]
-[school bell rings]

06:53.496 --> 06:56.833
Mr. Lake, I look forward
to your presentation tomorrow.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.961
Yeah. [chuckles nervously]
I'm... ready.

07:00.045 --> 07:05.258
Hey, Claire! Hey! You know, I got this
Spanish exam coming up. <i>Muy importante.</i>

07:05.342 --> 07:08.470
[chuckles] And I was... I was looking
for someone to help me out--

07:08.553 --> 07:11.431
And I was looking for my scene partner
at last night's rehearsal.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.725
Oh, man, the play! I wasn't--

07:13.808 --> 07:17.646
I don't know what you've got going on,
but this play is pretty important to me.

07:17.729 --> 07:21.149
My family's coming, and if you make me
look like an idiot up there--

07:21.232 --> 07:25.070
-Claire, I'm sorry. I promise I won't--
-Just be there tomorrow.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.241
And, by the way, I know Steve is a jerk,

07:30.325 --> 07:34.537
but there are better ways to finish
a fight than punching someone in the face.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.705
[sighs]

07:40.210 --> 07:41.836
[laughs deviously]

07:49.678 --> 07:51.221
[keys jingling]

07:57.894 --> 07:59.062
Huh?

08:01.731 --> 08:03.525
[muttering]

08:04.192 --> 08:05.819
[whistling]

08:08.196 --> 08:09.906
[growls]

08:10.991 --> 08:12.617
[snarls]

08:19.708 --> 08:24.838
We build it here? Right under
their noses? Are you a fool?

08:24.921 --> 08:28.383
Haven't you ever heard that
the best hiding place is in plain sight--

08:29.134 --> 08:33.346
Don't patronize me, Impure.

08:33.429 --> 08:37.600
We want the same thing, Bular.
I know you don't like waiting,

08:37.683 --> 08:42.522
but it's taken time for the changelings
to acquire the remaining pieces.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.523
[roars]

08:46.901 --> 08:48.194
[grunts]

08:48.278 --> 08:53.742
My father has waited centuries.
The Age of Gunmar is at hand.

08:59.247 --> 09:03.418
Remember when I told you
all Trollhunters must start small?

09:08.006 --> 09:11.760
Full disclosure, I'm a little worried
how I let you talk me into this.

09:11.843 --> 09:12.844
[grunts]

09:16.639 --> 09:17.974
[pipes whistling]

09:22.145 --> 09:24.481
Still bad idea.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.565
Wait a minute.

09:25.648 --> 09:29.736
So, how does me going into this thing
help me get a gnome out of a hole?

09:29.819 --> 09:33.698
If a gnome won't come out,
the Trollhunter must go in.

09:33.782 --> 09:34.824
Wait, what?

09:34.908 --> 09:38.453
[chuckles] Don't worry. We often use
the Furgolator to compress minerals.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.330
And now for the anthracite!

09:41.122 --> 09:42.499
Hey!

09:42.582 --> 09:46.252
But you've done this a few times
on flesh and bone, right? Right?

09:46.336 --> 09:47.962
[Blinky]
Not exactly.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.131
But I'm not concerned.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.259
Well, that's because you are not
the one trapped in this thing.

09:53.343 --> 09:57.472
Nothing to worry about, Master Jim.
We work best under pressure.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.766
I can't see anything!

09:59.849 --> 10:03.103
[coughs]
Why is there so much smoke?

10:03.186 --> 10:05.355
[creaking, rumbling]

10:05.438 --> 10:07.273
[farting noises]

10:07.357 --> 10:10.443
[gasps] Come on, you guys gotta
get him out of there!

10:11.277 --> 10:13.029
Don't just stand there, Aaarrrgghh!

10:14.364 --> 10:17.700
-[grunting]
-[pipes whistling]

10:17.784 --> 10:19.244
[coughing]

10:20.578 --> 10:23.915
[sighs] Looks like it didn't work.
Hope you have a plan B.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.041
[screams]

10:25.125 --> 10:28.419
-On the contrary.
-He's like an action figure.

10:28.503 --> 10:32.632
The Furgolator functioned perfectly!
[laughs]

10:37.011 --> 10:38.012
[sighs]

10:38.096 --> 10:41.891
Real subtle. "We've got to start small.
Deal with the little problem."

10:41.975 --> 10:44.144
This is a huge problem!

10:44.227 --> 10:48.940
I can't be shrunk! I have exams to take!
I have sinks to reach!

10:49.023 --> 10:53.903
You have a gnome to catch. Now, onward,
Master Jim, and fetch your destiny!

10:57.991 --> 11:01.077
Mmm... Your sword, my liege.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.954
[yelps]

11:06.082 --> 11:07.500
[yelps, groans]

11:12.714 --> 11:17.135
Oh, one last thing to know
when dealing with a gnome, Master Jim,

11:17.218 --> 11:19.596
and this is of dire importance:

11:19.679 --> 11:22.390
Do not touch its hat.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.184
Of course. It's right there
in <i>A Brief Recapitulation.</i>

11:25.268 --> 11:27.437
-You remember!
-Of course not!

11:27.520 --> 11:30.398
Nothing in this world makes sense!

11:30.481 --> 11:31.774
[screams]

11:31.858 --> 11:35.445
Uh, this is one creepy little dude.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.702
[gnome laughing]

11:45.079 --> 11:48.833
[chattering incoherently]

11:48.917 --> 11:51.920
Whoa. Aren't you a big fellow now?

11:52.003 --> 11:54.714
[chattering]

11:56.549 --> 11:57.550
[chattering]

11:58.718 --> 11:59.928
[chattering angrily]

12:03.681 --> 12:05.308
Hmm... [chuckles]

12:07.226 --> 12:10.438
-[laughing]
-I've got to get that amulet back.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.273
Ya-hoo! Uh-oh!

12:13.149 --> 12:15.693
-[yelps]
-[gasps, growls]

12:15.777 --> 12:19.364
It's okay, it's okay.
I like Nougat Nummies, too.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.172
-[fighting]
-[glass breaking]

12:36.255 --> 12:38.841
That doesn't sound favorable.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.180
[grunting]

12:44.263 --> 12:46.891

Oh, my God. I touched his hat.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.810
[gasps, shouts]

12:49.644 --> 12:51.813
Oh, I touched his hat. I touched his hat!

12:51.896 --> 12:53.189

Daylight is mine to command!

13:20.091 --> 13:22.301
[gasps, whimpers]

13:23.594 --> 13:25.304
Why hasn't he come out?

13:27.849 --> 13:29.600
[grumbles]

13:31.811 --> 13:34.439
[gnome chattering]

13:34.522 --> 13:35.690
[all gasp]

13:38.484 --> 13:40.778
[Blinky] You summoned the armor
and caught the gnome!

13:40.862 --> 13:42.488
Well played, Master Jim!

13:42.572 --> 13:45.450
Thank you, thank you.
I don't want to forget the little people.

13:47.577 --> 13:51.247
-Expedient and good-humored.
-Oh, my hero!

13:51.330 --> 13:52.582
[chattering]

13:52.665 --> 13:55.710
And what about this shrinking stuff?
When does it wear off?

13:55.793 --> 13:58.963
Don't worry. Sleep it off.
By morning, you'll be as good as new.

13:59.047 --> 14:02.759
And how you have earned it!
Jim "the Gnome Slayer"!

14:02.842 --> 14:06.929
He was so young.
There was so much music left in him.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.891
All that is left is for you
to take care of it.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.851
Wait, what? Take care of it?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.771
-Rule number two.
-"Always finish the fight."

14:14.854 --> 14:16.814
And by "finish"...

14:16.898 --> 14:20.526
-Deaden. End. <i>Le coup de grâce.</i>
-[groans]

14:23.654 --> 14:25.698
[snoring]

14:31.412 --> 14:35.291
[groans] Who are we kidding?
I can't kill this thing.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.293
I nearly had dinner with it.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.712
Neither of us are killers.

14:40.755 --> 14:41.756
I am.

14:42.757 --> 14:43.841
You are?

14:44.592 --> 14:46.135
Detective Snuggles.

14:46.803 --> 14:50.348
Nana warned me not to leave
my chocolate lying around.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.935
But it was just after Easter,
and I had pulled in a big haul.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.938
I never thought that cat
would find my stash.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.315
But he did.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.777
And by the time I found him,
it was too late.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.448
Death by chocolate.
There are worse ways to go.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.242
That wasn't the worst of it.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.703
I never had the heart to tell Nana,
so, to cover up the murder,

15:12.787 --> 15:18.209
I used to eat his cat food just to make it
look like he was still around.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.673
[sobbing]
And I liked it.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.675
[yawns]

15:25.758 --> 15:29.595
Don't beat yourself up, Tobes.
We both had a big day,

15:29.679 --> 15:32.432
and now's not the time to deal with this.

15:32.515 --> 15:35.977
We'll figure this out tomorrow,
when things are back to normal.

15:36.060 --> 15:39.063
But, no, you can't, Jim.
You have your exam to worry about.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.857
[sighs]
Good night, Tobes.

15:41.858 --> 15:46.320
-There's no way I'm going to make you...
-Go to bed, Tiny Jim.

15:46.404 --> 15:50.241
[chattering, snoring]

15:50.324 --> 15:51.993
[snarls, continues snoring]

15:52.076 --> 15:58.749
By morning rise, the dark deed
will be done and my soul will be damned.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.859
-[screams]
-What's wrong, Tiny Jim?

16:24.942 --> 16:26.861
Did you not sleep well
in Nana's dollhouse?

16:26.944 --> 16:29.739
-Why am I still small, Toby?
-I don't know.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.533
Maybe stuff works differently on trolls
than it does on humans.

16:32.617 --> 16:36.412
Oh, my gosh. The gnome! You did it?
I told you I was supposed to--

16:36.496 --> 16:39.123
-Oh, no! School!
-We have to call you in sick.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.667
Tell them you ate too much chocolate.
That always works.

16:41.751 --> 16:45.213
No, <i>Señor</i> Uhl can sniff out a lie
a mile away.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.553
That's it! Toby, I need you
to do me a huge favor.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.431
Well, maybe a small one. But huge.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.433
[panting]

16:57.517 --> 17:00.394
Hey, Jello Mold! Why aren't you
in your gym clothes?

17:00.478 --> 17:03.481
Sorry, Coach!
No gym today! Got the shingles!

17:04.147 --> 17:07.693
[Uhl] Jim Lake? Jim Lake?
Is Jim Lake here?

17:07.777 --> 17:11.155
How disappointing...
but not entirely unexpected.

17:11.239 --> 17:14.659
-Moving on.
-No problemo! Jim's here, virtually.

17:14.742 --> 17:19.664
¡Hola! <i>Sorry I couldn't be </i> en escuela <i>,</i>
Señor <i> Uhl, but I'm sick </i> en casa.

17:19.747 --> 17:23.000
Which is fitting, since I'm doing
<i>mi comprehensión presentación</i>

17:23.084 --> 17:27.463
on Ponce de León,
who <i>muerto</i>-ed from a great illness.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.633
Hey! "<i>Muerto</i>-ed" is not a word!

17:30.716 --> 17:34.011
Nope. I'm curious to see where
this is going. Continue, Mr. Lake.

17:34.095 --> 17:37.557
<i>Ponce de León, one of the most</i>
famoso <i> Spanish </i> conquistadores

17:37.640 --> 17:41.102
<i>-is best associated with...</i>
-[vacuuming, humming]

17:41.185 --> 17:44.230
...the <i>fuente de la juventud</i>,
the Fountain of Youth.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.650
<i>-What is that horrible noise?</i>
-Uh, <i>construcción.</i>

17:47.733 --> 17:51.696
Uh, remodeling. A minor intrusion.
<i>Un minuto, Señor </i> Uhl.

17:51.779 --> 17:52.780
[vacuuming, humming]

17:52.863 --> 17:56.117
What are you doing in here,
Mr. Meow Meow?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.327
<i>-Mr. Lake, are you there?</i>
-[growls]

17:58.411 --> 18:02.331
<i>-We don't have all time.</i>
-No, no... no need to fight at home.

18:02.415 --> 18:06.836
Ponce de León joined Columbus
in the New... New-- What in the world?

18:06.919 --> 18:11.757
Did Toby lock you up?
Do you need some fresh air?

18:11.841 --> 18:13.968
Don't get into too much trouble.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.846
I wouldn't want you to interrupt
Nana's true crime show.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.598
[door closes]

18:19.390 --> 18:21.976
-[Uhl] <i>Hello?</i>
-[screams]

18:22.059 --> 18:23.853
[gnome laughing]

18:23.936 --> 18:25.771
<i>You seem distracted.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

18:25.855 --> 18:26.856
I'm fine, I'm fine!

18:26.939 --> 18:30.693
Uh, he sailed <i>las carreras</i>
across the <i>oceano...</i>

18:30.776 --> 18:35.448
<i>-Mr. Lake? I don't follow.</i>
<i>-</i> [footsteps]

18:36.032 --> 18:37.241

18:37.325 --> 18:39.619
[screams]
<i>¡Arriba!</i>

18:39.702 --> 18:42.997
<i>Oh, what joy this new world was!</i>
¡Qué bueno!

18:43.080 --> 18:45.333
You're out of frame, Mr. Lake.
I am confused.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.419
Just some technical difficulty!
[chuckles] No problemo.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.796
[imitates beeping]
Tiny Jim, are you all right?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.965
Do I look all right?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.636
-[grunts]
-[growls]

18:58.387 --> 19:01.098
-[groans]
-[panting]

19:01.182 --> 19:04.018
<i>And that'll be all for my </i> presentación.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.812
Actually, by my count,
you are three words short, Mr. Lake.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.607
If you can't finish the exam,
I'll have to fail you.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.108
[stammering]
<i>Uh, in that case,</i>

19:11.192 --> 19:14.403
<i>there were </i> muchos problemas
<i>in the </i> Nuevo Mundo <i>, the New World!</i>

19:14.487 --> 19:16.697
<i>-Um...</i>
-[fighting]

19:16.781 --> 19:20.034
<i>Like vermin who you can't</i>
<i>seem to get rid of. </i> Ratas.

19:21.786 --> 19:25.039
[grunts]
I've got you now, gnome!

19:25.122 --> 19:29.794
[panting] But, in the end,
they were taken care of.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.587
<i>And that is it for my </i> presentación.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.715
<i>I hope this wasn't too much trouble,</i>
Señor <i> Uhl. </i> Hasta luego.

19:34.799 --> 19:38.844
-Spectacular!
-Very, very informative, Mr. Lake.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.846
-C-plus.
-[groans]

19:40.930 --> 19:44.058
-Fine. B-minus.
-[Eli] Jim! Jim, what's wrong?

19:44.141 --> 19:46.519
-[groans] <i>It's happening!</i>
-What's happening?

19:46.602 --> 19:48.938
-[groans] <i>It's happen...</i>
-High five!

19:49.021 --> 19:51.023
Internet connections, am I right?
Gotta go. Bye!

19:51.107 --> 19:52.900
-[school bell rings]
-[students chattering]

19:54.402 --> 19:56.862
Jim! You're okay! And big!

19:56.946 --> 20:00.157
I think my spleen switched sides,
but everything's better now.

20:00.241 --> 20:04.161
I'm sorry I failed you, Jim. I should
have done it when I had the chance.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.538
[moans]

20:05.621 --> 20:08.999
I thought he was attacking me,
but all he wanted was a home.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.835
Look! He's even found a friend.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.170
[singing]

20:13.254 --> 20:17.842
[sighs] He has the mind of a vermin
but the soul of an artist.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.636
Blinky said we needed
to "take care of him,"

20:20.720 --> 20:22.888
but what if we, like, take care of him?

20:22.972 --> 20:25.516
I know it's not exactly
the second rule to Trollhunting,

20:25.599 --> 20:29.270
but, for this one,
maybe we do it in our own way,

20:29.353 --> 20:30.604
without the murdering.

20:30.688 --> 20:34.775
We can keep him? Jim, I already
have a name. Gnome Chompsky.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.610
Chompsky. I like it.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.282
[inhales, yawns]

20:41.365 --> 20:43.284
Pretty good for a first mission.

20:43.367 --> 20:47.121
Two crises averted. It's not like
you get to rehearse these things.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.374
[gasps]
Oh, no! Rehearsal!

20:51.000 --> 20:54.837
"Oh, Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"

20:54.920 --> 20:55.921
"Shall I hear..."

20:56.005 --> 20:59.925
"Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?"

21:00.009 --> 21:01.469
[groans]

21:01.552 --> 21:05.931
-[clears throat]
-Oh, Mr. Lake!

21:06.015 --> 21:09.769
Your repeated tardiness has forced me
to take precautions.

21:09.852 --> 21:13.522
Mr. Palchuk will now serve
as your understudy.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.316
[imitates explosion]

21:15.399 --> 21:18.277
-[Steve chuckles]
-Hmm.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.070
[groans]

21:26.827 --> 21:29.205
-You're late.
-And you're impatient.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.666
I was waiting
for another package to arrive.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.296
-[sighs]
-[sighs]

21:47.389 --> 21:50.100
[Strickler]
Killahead Bridge will soon be complete.

21:50.184 --> 21:54.313
Our man from Germany will be arriving
with more pieces soon.

21:54.396 --> 21:58.609
And my father will know freedom and glory.

21:58.692 --> 22:02.071
Hey! What are you doing in here?
[gasps, whimpers]

22:02.154 --> 22:04.949
-You were followed?
-Of course not.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.826
I brought you a midnight snack.
