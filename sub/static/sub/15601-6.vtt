I could swallow you both whole.

07:12.200 --> 07:12.933
>> Don't do that.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.867
>> We wouldn't enjoy that.

07:14.867 --> 07:15.433
>> What the audience

07:15.433 --> 07:16.400
might not know is that

07:16.400 --> 07:17.800
these two have taken on

07:17.800 --> 07:18.367
a business partner

07:18.367 --> 07:18.900
who happens to be

07:18.900 --> 07:21.367
a super famous celebrity.

07:21.367 --> 07:22.300
>> Yep, we did.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.933
>> Really famous.

07:23.933 --> 07:24.533
>> Well, let's meet

07:24.533 --> 07:25.433
these girls' business partner,

07:25.433 --> 07:26.200
one of the world's

07:32.433 --> 07:33.567
Double G.

07:33.567 --> 07:34.300
You picked the right time

07:34.300 --> 07:35.600
to come to "The Helen Show."

What? What? What?

07:41.967 --> 07:43.567
Whoo.

07:43.567 --> 07:45.800
Hey, girl.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.333
How are you today?

07:46.333 --> 07:46.800
>> I'm good.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.633
>> Get on over here.

07:48.633 --> 07:51.067
Unh. Unh. Unh.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.933
What?

07:53.933 --> 07:55.267
What? What?

07:58.433 --> 07:58.967
>> Oh boy.

07:58.967 --> 07:59.600
You got my heart beating

07:59.600 --> 08:01.467
like a bunny rabbit.

08:06.233 --> 08:07.067
>> Are you sure we're not going

08:07.067 --> 08:07.633
to get in trouble

08:07.633 --> 08:08.867
for skipping class?

08:08.867 --> 08:09.533
>> Hey, no.

08:09.533 --> 08:11.633
You two are in class.

08:11.633 --> 08:13.600
>> Huh?

08:13.600 --> 08:15.300
>> And Kenzie Bell?

08:15.300 --> 08:19.133
>> Present!

08:19.133 --> 08:21.367
>> I know you're not Kenzie.

08:21.367 --> 08:25.867
>> I think I said "present!"

08:25.867 --> 08:27.967

08:39.833 --> 08:41.067
are the Game Shakers.

08:41.067 --> 08:41.500
>> Yes.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.067
>> That is true.

08:42.067 --> 08:44.300
>> Straight up.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.467
>> So, now that Sky Whale

08:45.467 --> 08:47.067
is like a worldwide sensation,

08:47.067 --> 08:48.267
what's next for you guys?

08:48.267 --> 08:48.967
>> Well, we're putting out

08:48.967 --> 08:50.800
a brand new game in two weeks.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.500
>> Oh yeah?

08:51.500 --> 08:52.300
What's it called?

08:52.300 --> 08:53.100
>> It's called...

08:53.100 --> 08:54.300
>> The name of the new game

08:54.300 --> 08:57.067
is called "Tiny Pickles."

[ applause and cheering ]

09:00.433 --> 09:01.167
>> Huh?

09:01.167 --> 09:02.933
No, no, it's not called that.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.067
>> Oh, yes it is.

09:04.067 --> 09:04.900
>> What are you--

09:04.900 --> 09:05.767
What's he doing?

09:05.767 --> 09:06.833
>> See, the game is based

09:06.833 --> 09:08.600
on a dream I had last night

09:08.600 --> 09:09.867
right after I had dinner

09:09.867 --> 09:12.267
at The Clam Jumper.

09:12.267 --> 09:13.600
>> Can we go to a commercial?

09:13.600 --> 09:14.367
>> Not yet.

09:14.367 --> 09:15.367
So, what happened in your dream?

09:15.367 --> 09:16.533
>> Okay, so, I'm in Mexico

09:16.533 --> 09:18.067
riding on a zebra,

09:18.067 --> 09:21.200
but the zebra had no stripes.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.867
>> Isn't a zebra with no stripes

09:22.867 --> 09:23.867
just a horse?

09:23.867 --> 09:26.667
>> Don't ask him questions.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.933
>> So, I'm riding on the zebra

09:27.933 --> 09:28.767
and right next to me

09:28.767 --> 09:29.933
riding on an elephant

09:29.933 --> 09:31.367
is LeBron James.

09:31.367 --> 09:32.767
>> What?

09:32.767 --> 09:33.267
>> And guess

09:33.267 --> 09:34.067
what he was dribbling?

09:34.067 --> 09:34.467
>> Was it one

09:34.467 --> 09:35.500
of those basketballs?

09:35.500 --> 09:36.067
>> No.

09:36.067 --> 09:37.500
>> Please don't say what it was.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.067
>> It was a crazy eyeball.

09:39.067 --> 09:40.267
>> Oh.

09:40.267 --> 09:41.067
>> Stop him.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.433
>> What do you want me to do?

09:42.433 --> 09:43.567
>> And guess what I see next?

09:43.567 --> 09:44.233
>> Tell me.

09:44.233 --> 09:47.500
>> A bunch of reverse mermaids.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.367
>> Reverse mermaids?

09:49.367 --> 09:50.200
>> What are those?

09:50.200 --> 09:52.200
Fish heads with lady legs?

09:52.200 --> 09:55.900
>> That's right, Glasses.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.333
>> Anyway, our game is called

09:57.333 --> 09:58.667
"Creature Crunch" and the way--

09:58.667 --> 09:59.533
>> So then I take out

09:59.533 --> 10:01.167
my pickle slingshot and I start

10:01.167 --> 10:02.400
shooting tiny pickles

10:02.400 --> 10:04.267
at the reverse mermaids.

10:04.267 --> 10:06.167
>> That is fantastic.

10:06.167 --> 10:08.400
>> Isn't it?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.800
>> Can I say something?

10:09.800 --> 10:10.400
>> I'm sorry, baby,

10:10.400 --> 10:11.033
we're out of time.

10:11.033 --> 10:11.567
>> What?

10:11.567 --> 10:12.200
>> But wait.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.000
>> America, get ready

10:13.000 --> 10:14.533

10:20.767 --> 10:21.600
>> Hey, Helen.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.500
Get up and dance with me.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.267
>> Don't mind if I do.

10:24.267 --> 10:24.800
>> This is called

10:24.800 --> 10:25.900
the "I'm Riding a Zebra."

>> Oh.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.867
>> Whoo.

10:32.867 --> 10:34.600
Whoo.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.667
>> We'll be right back.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.500
>> You are insane.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.867
You know that?

10:44.867 --> 10:47.367
You're a crazy person.

10:47.367 --> 10:48.133
>> That is no way

10:48.133 --> 10:49.400
to talk to a superstar.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.500
>> Ugh.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.367
>> Puppy number four.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.667
>> Nah. Next.

11:00.800 --> 11:01.433
>> How could you go

11:01.433 --> 11:02.767
on national television

11:02.767 --> 11:03.733
and tell the whole world

11:03.733 --> 11:04.567
we're putting out a game

11:04.567 --> 11:06.800
that we don't even have?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.100
>> Because I'm Double G

11:08.100 --> 11:09.667
and I do what I want.

11:12.767 --> 11:14.700
>> Puppy number five.

11:14.700 --> 11:15.367
>> Nah.

11:15.367 --> 11:15.933
That puppy

11:15.933 --> 11:18.067
doesn't have enough butt.

11:18.067 --> 11:18.933
I told you I need a puppy

11:18.933 --> 11:20.933
with a big butt.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.433
here showing you puppies?

>> Because I need one

>> "Big Butt Puppy."

11:35.533 --> 11:37.467
>> I got a snow cone.

11:37.467 --> 11:40.300
>> Well, we have a huge problem.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.967
It's going to be a huge hit.

Creature Crunch

11:50.267 --> 11:52.067
doesn't matter anymore.

11:52.067 --> 11:53.100
>> Why not?

11:53.100 --> 11:54.500
>> Because your wacked out daddy

11:54.500 --> 11:55.500
went on "The Helen Show"

11:55.500 --> 11:56.433
and told everyone

11:56.433 --> 11:57.267
that our new game's

11:57.267 --> 11:58.667
about some crazy dream

11:58.667 --> 11:59.600
that he had.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.700
>> About reverse mermaids,

12:00.700 --> 12:03.700
and zebras, and tiny pickles.

>> Aw, Dad.

Did you eat

12:05.867 --> 12:08.833
at The Clam Jumper again?

>> You know I love

12:09.367 --> 12:11.367
their cheesy potato cakes.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.100
>> But you said you'd quit.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.167
>> I'll quit again.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.900
>> No you won't.

12:15.900 --> 12:20.267
We can't keep doing this, Dad.

12:20.267 --> 12:21.333
>> So, our new game's not going

12:21.333 --> 12:22.767
to be Creature Crunch?

12:22.767 --> 12:24.267
>> No. Not now.

>> Now we have to make

12:25.533 --> 12:27.567
a Tiny Pickles game.

Are you serious?

>> Oh, man.

12:37.167 --> 12:38.167
>> Wait.

Do tiny pickles taste the same

12:39.567 --> 12:41.667
as large pickles?

13:08.167 --> 13:09.267
for the game?

in the game.

take a picture of your eyeball?

Whoo.

get the money for the food

14:51.233 --> 14:52.233
so I can get back

Wait.

Where'd he go?

>> He left, Dad.
