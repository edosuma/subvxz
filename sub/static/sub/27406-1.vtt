01:23.760 --> 01:25.127
<i>Let's welcome to the show</i>

01:25.129 --> 01:27.628
<i>Belgium's shining star
of the screen,</i>

01:27.630 --> 01:29.031
<i>Stefan Delvoe.</i>

01:30.867 --> 01:32.166
- Alan.
- Welcome back.

01:32.168 --> 01:34.534
- How are you?
- Great.

01:34.536 --> 01:35.937
So good to see you.

01:35.939 --> 01:37.571
You're looking
quite well.

01:37.573 --> 01:38.673
Hmm, thank you.

01:44.378 --> 01:47.314
<i>Tell us
how you got started?</i>

01:47.316 --> 01:49.015
<i>I'm lucky
because I get to play</i>

01:49.017 --> 01:50.217
<i>all these different characters.</i>

01:50.219 --> 01:52.652
<i>I become someone new
every time</i>

01:52.654 --> 01:55.090
<i>or at least live in
their skin for a while.</i>

01:56.158 --> 01:58.924
We need stories
to make sense of the world

01:58.926 --> 02:01.694
and that's what
movies are.

02:01.696 --> 02:03.298
That's why I wanted
to make movies.

02:04.532 --> 02:06.067
<i>Without stories,</i>

02:06.901 --> 02:08.368
<i>the truth is too random.</i>

03:02.787 --> 03:05.488
The body of
Belgian film star Stefan Delvoe

03:05.490 --> 03:07.589
was found earlier
this morning by his wife,

03:07.591 --> 03:10.226
<i>American photographer
Katherine Grant who came in...</i>

03:17.435 --> 03:20.201
<i>The young actor's
death has been determined a suicide.</i>

03:20.203 --> 03:21.803
<i>The couple's rocky marriage</i>

03:21.805 --> 03:23.471
<i>and Delvoe's alleged drug use</i>

03:23.473 --> 03:26.675
<i>could be connected
to his shocking death.</i>

03:26.677 --> 03:29.247
<i>Just one week ago after
photographs of Delvoe...</i>

03:33.016 --> 03:35.482
<i>Striking a photographer
in an uncharacteristic rage...</i>

03:35.484 --> 03:38.420
Who are you? Get the hell
out of here, asshole.

03:38.422 --> 03:41.124
What do you want?
What are they paying you, huh?

04:42.048 --> 04:43.816
Great.
That is just great.

04:45.550 --> 04:46.719
That's great.

04:47.854 --> 04:48.886
That's great.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.855
Can you straighten
your legs a bit?

04:50.857 --> 04:52.225
Uh, bend your elbows.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.693
Yep, hold it straight.

04:56.795 --> 04:57.961
Can you turn
the other way?

04:57.963 --> 04:59.598
Uh, like this?

05:00.932 --> 05:02.235
Uh...

05:03.568 --> 05:05.701
Actually,
forget about the legs.

05:05.703 --> 05:08.471
- Just, uh, try to relax...
- Phone call for you.

05:08.473 --> 05:10.106
- ...a little bit. Just a second.
- Phone call for you.

05:10.108 --> 05:11.307
And just... Yeah, um.

05:11.309 --> 05:13.309
They say
it's an emergency.

05:13.311 --> 05:15.646
Apparently, your mother is
in a hospital in Brussels.

06:18.973 --> 06:21.173
No, do not
put it in my elbow.

06:21.175 --> 06:23.209
I can't move
my fucking arm.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.912
Look, put it there

06:26.914 --> 06:28.214
or wherever you can
put it down there.

06:28.216 --> 06:30.181
But do not put it there.

06:30.183 --> 06:31.450
Hey, Mom.

06:31.452 --> 06:32.684
Oh, thank God,
you're here.

06:32.686 --> 06:35.356
This woman is totally incompetent.
Sorry.

06:52.038 --> 06:54.606
- <i>Oui.</i>
- Ow!

06:58.711 --> 07:01.346
<i>Merci.</i>

07:01.348 --> 07:04.518
Well, you two certainly had
a laugh at my expense.

07:05.385 --> 07:06.951
She just
didn't understand.

07:07.819 --> 07:09.219
I'm not stupid,
you know.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.323
I know. It would be
much easier if you were.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.694
I'm so glad you're here.

07:18.363 --> 07:22.267
Oh, honey, and I love the hair.
The short hair.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.134
How pretty,
thank you.

07:25.136 --> 07:26.605
So how was your flight?

07:28.239 --> 07:31.106
Mom, why are you here?

07:31.108 --> 07:32.040
What happened?

07:32.042 --> 07:33.478
Oh, I just had a...

07:34.279 --> 07:36.347
...minuscule stroke.

07:36.713 --> 07:37.979
Stroke?

07:37.981 --> 07:39.417
I'm totally fine now.

07:40.017 --> 07:41.749
Who's your doctor?

07:41.751 --> 07:43.620
A very nice Indian man.

07:44.955 --> 07:47.923
But why are you "here" here?

07:47.925 --> 07:51.493
In Brussels? Why are you
having a stroke in Brussels?

07:51.495 --> 07:54.629
If you had answered
your phone, you would know.

07:54.631 --> 07:55.530
Know what?

07:55.532 --> 07:57.198
I tried to leave
a message, a voicemail

07:57.200 --> 07:58.966
Saying what?

07:58.968 --> 08:00.669
Anneke is selling the loft,

08:00.671 --> 08:02.805
and I came here
to pack up your things.

08:05.107 --> 08:07.040
Honey, I'm trying
to help you.

08:07.042 --> 08:08.477
Why would you do that?

08:09.145 --> 08:10.411
I don't want those things.

08:10.413 --> 08:12.046
She can throw them away.

08:12.048 --> 08:16.352
Anneke has been trying to deal
with this for almost a year now.

08:21.923 --> 08:22.991
<i>Miss Grant.</i>

08:26.394 --> 08:27.929
We know this is difficult.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.600
Your mother-in-law
says that

08:33.602 --> 08:35.933
the two of you were
in the process of separating.

08:35.936 --> 08:38.472
Is it possible that had
something to do with it?

08:40.408 --> 08:44.009
<i>After photographs of Delvoe and a
mystery woman leaked to the press,</i>

08:44.010 --> 08:48.347
<i>Delvoe lost his temper and struck the
photographer in an uncharacteristic rage.</i>

08:48.349 --> 08:50.849
<i>What are
they paying you, huh?</i>

08:50.851 --> 08:53.519
When was the last
time you had contact with him?

08:54.587 --> 08:55.786
What?

08:55.788 --> 08:57.757
When was the last time you
were in contact with him?

09:11.704 --> 09:14.073
We hadn't spoken
in a few days.

09:16.908 --> 09:18.541
Basically,
there's a blockage

09:18.543 --> 09:19.810
at the base of the brain.

09:20.812 --> 09:23.446
If left untreated,
this pressure builds

09:23.448 --> 09:26.416
and eventually bursts
causing severe damage.

09:26.418 --> 09:28.251
Medication should bring it down.

09:28.253 --> 09:30.388
With treatment and rest,
she should be fine.

09:32.890 --> 09:34.290
So, we can go home?

09:34.292 --> 09:35.492
She's free to go,

09:35.494 --> 09:37.494
but I strongly advise
against air travel

09:37.496 --> 09:39.128
for at least a week.

09:39.130 --> 09:40.532
Too much pressure.

10:54.101 --> 10:56.101
Can I help you?

10:56.103 --> 10:57.537
I'm Edward.

11:00.474 --> 11:01.707
Oh.

11:01.709 --> 11:04.142
Oh, hey, how'd you
get in there?

11:04.144 --> 11:07.378
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

11:07.380 --> 11:08.646
Holy Jesus,
mother of Christ!

11:08.648 --> 11:10.682
Sorry, this isn't your room.

11:10.684 --> 11:12.751
Yeah, but that's my hand.

11:13.587 --> 11:15.522
- Are you okay?
- Hmm.

11:16.423 --> 11:18.088
I can't...

11:18.090 --> 11:20.760
I can't... Maybe I might
need mouth-to-mouth.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.034
Who was that?

11:31.403 --> 11:32.738
No on, go back to sleep.

11:33.304 --> 11:34.707
Are you smoking?

11:35.340 --> 11:36.441
No.

11:37.175 --> 11:39.177
I can smell it.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.745
As I was telling
your mother,

12:53.747 --> 12:56.083
there are a few financial
details we need to go over.

12:57.853 --> 12:59.220
Just unlock.

13:07.460 --> 13:08.863
I never thought
I'd see you again.

13:16.270 --> 13:18.034
As I was saying,

13:18.036 --> 13:20.771
you're on the deed
to the apartment.

13:20.773 --> 13:22.173
But since you've made
no claim,

13:22.175 --> 13:23.543
it is now gone to me.

13:25.612 --> 13:27.245
We tried to contact you.

13:27.247 --> 13:28.479
Many times.

13:28.481 --> 13:30.115
Apparently you've been busy.

13:37.456 --> 13:39.191
I haven't really done
much of anything.

13:40.493 --> 13:42.093
We need to fix
the roof.

13:43.428 --> 13:44.628
There's so much rain here
all the time,

13:44.630 --> 13:45.762
it's really hard
to fix everything.

13:45.764 --> 13:49.566
Um, where would I find
some garbage bags?

13:49.568 --> 13:51.501
They should be
under the sink.

13:51.503 --> 13:52.938
Right, Katherine,
under the sink?

13:55.339 --> 13:56.607
Okay.

14:12.623 --> 14:14.757
Investigators dropped
that off.

14:14.759 --> 14:17.257
Why are you
keeping all of this?

14:17.259 --> 14:19.192
Me? This is your mess.

14:19.194 --> 14:21.161
This is gonna cut it,
but it's a start so...

14:21.163 --> 14:23.698
It's been a year,
not even a phone call?

14:23.700 --> 14:25.400
What kind of person
does that?

14:25.402 --> 14:26.568
I'm sorry.

14:26.570 --> 14:27.802
- Okay, wait, no...
- Sorry?

14:27.804 --> 14:29.236
...let's not
get into this.

14:29.238 --> 14:31.973
If it weren't for you, this
would have never happened.

14:31.975 --> 14:33.975
Excuse me,
but that is ridiculous.

14:33.977 --> 14:35.642
Your son was
a drug addict.

14:35.644 --> 14:37.377
- Mom.
- What could she have done about it?

14:37.379 --> 14:38.378
He made
his own choices.

14:38.380 --> 14:39.814
Is that what
you tell yourself?

14:39.816 --> 14:42.816
Well, I suppose your way of
dealing with it is better?

14:42.818 --> 14:44.250
What does
that mean?

14:44.252 --> 14:47.754
I mean, should we set another
place at the table here

14:47.756 --> 14:48.889
and wait for him
to come back?

14:48.891 --> 14:50.793
Will the
two of you just stop?

14:52.461 --> 14:55.094
They close with the
bank in two weeks.

14:55.096 --> 14:58.331
By the end of the month, anything
left here goes to the dump.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.834
My lawyer will be
in touch.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.343
What a bitch.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.283
Honey, please
don't smoke.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.732
Do you know who he might
have been hanging out with?

15:34.734 --> 15:36.369
Or where he might have gone?

15:43.709 --> 15:48.112
Also, we were unable
to locate his mobile phone.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.016
<i>Would you know
anything about that?</i>

16:11.803 --> 16:13.836
We don't
have to do this today.

16:13.838 --> 16:15.437
I have
a pounding headache.

16:15.439 --> 16:18.475
Let's just
fucking leave.

16:30.486 --> 16:32.054
Which one
is the caramel?

16:32.056 --> 16:33.991
That one? Okay great. Thank you.

16:38.227 --> 16:40.229
Mmm, very good.

17:31.377 --> 17:36.614
What happened? Good Heavens.
She just fell down on the floor.

17:38.451 --> 17:39.552
Excuse me.

17:44.190 --> 17:46.224
The medication
hasn't worked at all,

17:46.226 --> 17:49.961
which lead us to the
probability of surgical removal.

17:49.963 --> 17:51.462
Surgical removal?

17:51.464 --> 17:53.031
Possibly, yes.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.699
From her brain?

17:55.701 --> 17:56.969
Yes.

17:58.270 --> 18:00.405
Would that be considered
brain surgery?

18:01.106 --> 18:02.072
Yes.

18:02.074 --> 18:04.908
You should plan to stay
for a couple of weeks.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.209
In the case
she loses consciousness,

18:06.211 --> 18:08.811
it's very important to have
a family member around...

18:19.257 --> 18:20.992
It's a blood clot.

18:21.959 --> 18:24.193
He said the medication
isn't working

18:24.195 --> 18:26.562
and surgery might be
a possibility.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.230
<i>Ethan! Can I...</i>

18:28.232 --> 18:30.799
<i>Ethan, I said no.</i>

18:30.801 --> 18:33.370
<i>Hey, sorry... Can you say that again.
What did you say?</i>

18:34.105 --> 18:35.539
They don't really know.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.242
Nobody really knows.

18:39.277 --> 18:40.642
<i>Okay.</i>

18:40.644 --> 18:42.643
<i>Okay, then,
so you were there,</i>

18:42.645 --> 18:45.248
<i>so you need to understand
what's going on, right?</i>

18:46.683 --> 18:48.817
<i>If I could be there,
I would,</i>

18:48.819 --> 18:51.052
<i>but I can't be there, Kate.</i>

18:51.054 --> 18:53.222
<i>Okay, so you're gonna
have to deal with this.</i>

18:54.223 --> 18:55.424
I am.

18:58.427 --> 18:59.929
<i>Are you smoking?</i>

19:00.629 --> 19:01.895
No.

19:01.897 --> 19:03.532
<i>I can hear you.</i>

19:04.333 --> 19:05.433
I'm not.

19:07.902 --> 19:09.238
<i>I thought you quit.</i>

19:12.740 --> 19:13.806
I did.

19:13.808 --> 19:15.008
<i>Hey, Ethan.</i>

19:15.010 --> 19:16.475
<i>That's... I warned you
this was gonna happen.</i>

19:16.477 --> 19:18.476
<i>Fuck, I have to go. Ethan's
bleeding from the head.</i>

19:18.478 --> 19:21.113
<i>Just let me know what the doctor
says when you talk to him.</i>

19:21.115 --> 19:22.884
<i>I gotta go. Honey...</i>

21:58.098 --> 22:00.600
You look like an iris.

23:15.871 --> 23:17.239
Hey, Leon.

23:47.469 --> 23:48.869
I was wondering
when you'd turn up.

23:50.038 --> 23:51.506
You've been gone
a while.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.309
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

23:57.578 --> 23:59.346
Sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.513
It'll make
your fingers bleed

24:01.515 --> 24:02.883
scratching around
like this.

24:04.650 --> 24:06.219
Like what?

24:07.521 --> 24:09.356
Stefan had
a lot of secrets.

24:10.256 --> 24:11.657
Let it be.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.026
Who are you?

24:16.028 --> 24:17.396
I'm a friend.

24:19.165 --> 24:20.699
We're all friends here.

24:46.924 --> 24:48.424
Hey.

24:48.426 --> 24:49.793
I'd like to leave now.

24:57.801 --> 24:59.468
Stefan!
Stefan, over here!

24:59.470 --> 25:01.372
Stefan, here.
Right here!

25:02.206 --> 25:04.707
Look this way.
One more for us.

25:05.576 --> 25:06.843
Stefan!

25:07.710 --> 25:09.177
Wow. Nice car, man.

25:09.179 --> 25:10.945
You have to give this car back.
It's ridiculous.

25:10.947 --> 25:12.548
Oh, my God.

25:12.550 --> 25:14.081
Now you're mad
at the car?

25:14.083 --> 25:16.917
It's embarrassing.
Are you okay to drive?

25:16.919 --> 25:18.785
One more,
one more!

25:37.574 --> 25:38.608
What?

25:39.841 --> 25:41.106
You know what?

25:41.108 --> 25:43.776
That girl?
She's nothing. She's...

25:43.778 --> 25:46.078
We were just doing a pump.
You should have joined us.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.947
Why do you have
to do that?

25:47.949 --> 25:51.884
Uh, come on. Don't make
such a big deal out of it.

25:51.886 --> 25:53.487
It's... It's Friday night.

25:56.123 --> 25:58.926
It's Friday night.
It's Friday...

26:11.639 --> 26:14.440
Okay,
can I show you something?

26:14.442 --> 26:15.740
Someone taught me
on set today.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.175
I practiced all day long
so I could show you.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.412
Are you wearing
your seat belt?

26:19.945 --> 26:21.348
Yeah, why?

26:32.625 --> 26:33.357
Oh, my God.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.558
It's cool, right?

26:34.560 --> 26:35.926
Stunt driver taught me.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.927
Oh, my God.

26:39.231 --> 26:40.664
Okay.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.466
Whoa!

26:42.468 --> 26:43.467
No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:43.469 --> 26:44.501
I get it, I get it.

26:44.503 --> 26:46.070
No, no, no,
let me try again.

26:48.873 --> 26:51.310
- Stefan, stop it.
- Whoa!

26:51.943 --> 26:54.477
Please, stop it.
Stefan!

26:55.480 --> 26:57.814
Stop the fucking car.

27:07.591 --> 27:09.993
Relax, you can trust me.

27:19.303 --> 27:21.202
Fuck, um,

27:21.204 --> 27:23.906
fucking piece
of shit. Shit.

27:25.208 --> 27:28.976
I cannot get
this zip up.

27:28.978 --> 27:30.112
Can you help?

27:31.681 --> 27:32.814
Please.

27:36.485 --> 27:37.719
You need to suck in.

27:37.721 --> 27:39.654
I am sucking.

27:42.357 --> 27:44.527
Thank you.

27:46.261 --> 27:47.829
I'm Frieda.

27:50.198 --> 27:52.131
Katherine.

27:52.133 --> 27:54.001
You know,
I thought it was you.

27:55.002 --> 27:56.504
"My God, wow.

27:57.238 --> 27:58.573
"It's his wife."

27:59.840 --> 28:01.840
Fuck.

28:01.842 --> 28:03.144
I really loved Stefan.

28:04.511 --> 28:06.044
I mean not like you.

28:06.046 --> 28:07.714
I never fucked him.

28:07.716 --> 28:10.451
I mean, I would love to.
Oh, my God.

28:11.852 --> 28:13.755
Anyway...

28:14.556 --> 28:15.822
It's so nice to meet you.

28:15.824 --> 28:16.788
You too.

28:16.790 --> 28:17.857
Hmm.

28:32.305 --> 28:33.872
Hello.

28:37.310 --> 28:38.746
Cheers.

29:08.439 --> 29:10.040
I'd like to take a bath.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.476
Okay.

29:17.481 --> 29:19.683
Can you make
the bath?

29:21.217 --> 29:22.150
Please.

29:22.152 --> 29:23.052
Oh.

29:23.554 --> 29:24.855
Yeah, okay.

29:29.192 --> 29:30.391
Where is it?

29:30.393 --> 29:31.828
Yeah.

29:38.435 --> 29:40.502
With bubbles, please.

29:58.187 --> 29:59.855
Lots of bubbles.

30:05.593 --> 30:06.994
Lots of bubbles.

30:13.367 --> 30:16.536
Now, can you get
in the bath?

30:38.758 --> 30:40.491
All right.

30:41.427 --> 30:42.863
I'm in.

30:48.602 --> 30:49.903
That's very nice.

31:14.459 --> 31:16.193
Could you please make
your hair wet?

32:32.165 --> 32:33.033
Oh.

32:36.403 --> 32:37.771
Thank you.

32:41.174 --> 32:42.342
You're welcome.

32:42.609 --> 32:43.843
Hmm.

32:47.948 --> 32:49.783
I told you
I was in a meeting.

32:52.051 --> 32:53.318
No, I was.

32:54.319 --> 32:55.387
Charlotte...

32:57.056 --> 32:58.456
Charlotte, you're acting
crazy, you know.

32:58.458 --> 33:01.193
You're the one who said you
wanted this in the first place.

33:02.061 --> 33:03.329
No, no, no, hey!

33:04.329 --> 33:05.731
Hey, I never said that.

33:06.398 --> 33:07.733
Hello?

33:14.306 --> 33:16.238
That's the thing with cell
phones you can never tell

33:16.240 --> 33:19.077
if someone hung up on you
or you just dropped a call.

33:20.244 --> 33:22.078
No, the best is when
someone hangs up on you,

33:22.080 --> 33:24.816
and then blames it on a dropped call.
That's a good one.

33:26.918 --> 33:28.385
Must happen
to you a lot.

33:37.395 --> 33:38.729
I'm Edward.

33:43.566 --> 33:46.167
You know, usually when
someone tells you their name,

33:46.169 --> 33:47.938
it's because they want
to know your name.

33:50.540 --> 33:51.639
Katherine.

33:51.641 --> 33:53.107
Oh.

33:53.109 --> 33:54.811
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Katherine.

33:55.210 --> 33:56.311
You too.

34:05.087 --> 34:07.089
You do something different
with you hair?

34:09.625 --> 34:10.958
I like it.

34:41.155 --> 34:42.222
Whoa.

34:58.004 --> 34:59.172
Stefan.

35:34.873 --> 35:36.839
<i>Yo, Stefan here.</i>

35:36.841 --> 35:38.541
<i>Leave a message.
Thank you.</i>

35:39.677 --> 35:40.842
So, I don't know
where you are,

35:40.844 --> 35:42.310
but the place is
a fucking disaster,

35:42.312 --> 35:44.381
and you left the door
wide open again.

35:46.016 --> 35:47.516
You're obviously
getting high here

35:47.518 --> 35:50.054
so I guess that's that.

35:52.055 --> 35:53.955
I'm clearing out
my desk today,

35:53.957 --> 35:55.859
and the movers are getting
the rest next week.

35:57.293 --> 35:59.595
I hope you know
this is not what I wanted.

36:04.801 --> 36:07.335
Shit.

36:21.817 --> 36:23.550
<i>Yo, Stefan here.</i>

36:23.552 --> 36:25.351
<i>Leave a message.
Thank you.</i>

36:28.656 --> 36:29.991
Stefan.

36:32.661 --> 36:34.262
Can you hear me?

36:36.698 --> 36:38.066
Stefan?

37:32.217 --> 37:34.618
- Mom, I'll be right there.
- <i>Katherine?</i>

37:34.620 --> 37:37.287
<i>It's Emile.</i>

37:37.289 --> 37:40.589
<i>Look, I'm sorry for my
behavior last night.</i>

37:40.591 --> 37:45.295
<i>I was, um, insensitive.</i>

37:45.297 --> 37:49.598
<i>We have a lot to talk about
and I have something for you.</i>

37:49.600 --> 37:52.069
<i>So, please, come see me.</i>

38:27.636 --> 38:28.801
<i>Who are you?</i>

38:28.803 --> 38:30.237
<i>After photos of Delvoe</i>

38:30.239 --> 38:31.604
<i>and a mystery woman
were leaked to the press,</i>

38:31.606 --> 38:34.374
<i>Delvoe lost his temper,
striking a photographer</i>

38:34.376 --> 38:36.977
<i>in an uncharacteristic rage.</i>

38:38.314 --> 38:39.413
<i>The star had just announced</i>

38:39.415 --> 38:40.880
<i>his commitment
to the role of Cuss</i>

38:40.882 --> 38:45.217
<i>in the big budget American
action series, </i> Steel Chase.

38:45.219 --> 38:48.788
<i>The couple's rocky marriage and
Delvoe's alleged drug use...</i>

38:48.790 --> 38:51.124
You spent quite a bit of
money in Paris last weekend.

38:51.126 --> 38:53.326
- That's good.
- Uh-huh.

38:53.328 --> 38:55.161
Your bill from Aspasbie alone,

38:55.163 --> 38:57.296
is more than most people
pay in rent.

38:57.298 --> 38:59.031
It was.

38:59.033 --> 39:00.699
Chicken is good.

39:00.701 --> 39:03.438
It won't last forever, you know.
You have to be smart.

39:04.905 --> 39:06.340
Well...

39:07.040 --> 39:08.474
We were celebrating.

39:10.476 --> 39:11.443
Hmm?

39:11.445 --> 39:12.844
I got the part.

39:12.846 --> 39:13.945
<i>Steel Chase.</i>

39:17.417 --> 39:18.816
Oh.

39:20.253 --> 39:21.754
I knew you
could do it.

39:23.123 --> 39:26.492
All our
hard work is paying off.

39:27.394 --> 39:28.593
Huh.

39:34.033 --> 39:37.434
I thought you were going
to say she's pregnant.

39:37.436 --> 39:39.936
What a disaster that would be.

39:39.938 --> 39:42.171
No, no, it's just...

39:42.173 --> 39:44.609
I mean, can't be a heartthrob
with a baby on the way.

39:45.510 --> 39:47.045
I mean, it's bad enough
you're married.

39:55.052 --> 39:56.587
We were celebrating.

39:59.556 --> 40:02.327
Because the film shoots
in Rhinebeck, New York.

40:05.295 --> 40:06.629
We're gonna
move there.

40:13.604 --> 40:14.671
You're moving?

40:15.738 --> 40:16.871
For how long?

40:16.873 --> 40:20.241
Um, we decided, we've been
here for a couple of years,

40:20.243 --> 40:21.942
so we could try being there
for a couple of years.

40:21.944 --> 40:23.247
We decided,
did we?

40:25.382 --> 40:26.847
Mom.

40:26.849 --> 40:28.249
It's just
a plane ride away.

40:28.251 --> 40:29.649
You can come visit
anytime.

40:29.651 --> 40:33.089
And there's a really nice bed
and breakfast right in town.

40:36.526 --> 40:37.626
A bed and breakfast?

40:39.529 --> 40:40.592
Well...

41:24.204 --> 41:25.571
Based on the MRI,

41:25.573 --> 41:27.105
and the amount of
cortisone in the blood,

41:27.107 --> 41:28.738
I would like
to schedule surgery.

41:28.740 --> 41:29.739
Oh.

41:29.741 --> 41:32.076
After the surgery, you'll
be in an induced coma

41:32.078 --> 41:33.578
which will allow
the brain to heal

41:33.580 --> 41:36.182
without the added stresses
of non-essential functions.

41:37.117 --> 41:38.382
Would you mind
my asking

41:38.384 --> 41:41.084
what my non-essential
functions are?

41:41.086 --> 41:42.686
We take it down
to the basics.

41:42.688 --> 41:45.889
Breathing, heart rate,
blood pressure.

41:45.891 --> 41:47.459
Involuntary functions.

42:22.259 --> 42:25.193
Yeah, but I just go, like...
And you never thought.

42:26.497 --> 42:29.029
I can't do it. Take out
the middle, like this...

42:29.031 --> 42:31.732
You're not going.
You're not going.

42:31.734 --> 42:32.636
I'm not letting you go.

43:38.165 --> 43:40.998
You came back. I'm
so happy to see you.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.200
No, actually, I'm looking for Emile.

43:43.202 --> 43:44.668
You think he's cute?

43:44.670 --> 43:46.503
I think he's cute.

43:46.505 --> 43:48.472
I'd fuck him for free.

43:48.474 --> 43:50.544
I think he's got
a girlfriend, though.

43:51.277 --> 43:52.777
Take these.

43:55.681 --> 43:56.815
Um...

43:58.149 --> 43:59.316
Do you work for him?

43:59.318 --> 44:01.084
- Who?
- Emile.

44:01.086 --> 44:02.787
Yeah, for a couple
of years.

44:06.725 --> 44:08.258
Emile is the best.

44:08.260 --> 44:10.026
A bit of a weirdo,

44:10.028 --> 44:11.429
but a good person.

44:13.498 --> 44:14.697
Hmm?

44:14.699 --> 44:16.064
Oh, no, thanks.

44:16.066 --> 44:17.935
Come on,
it's really good coke.

44:20.971 --> 44:22.039
Okay.

44:30.681 --> 44:32.447
How well did you
know Stefan?

44:32.449 --> 44:34.716
Yeah, you know,
we talked a bit.

44:34.718 --> 44:36.118
Blah, blah, blah.

44:36.120 --> 44:37.686
And the last night
that he was here,

44:37.688 --> 44:39.487
uh, was he with
a blond woman?

44:39.489 --> 44:41.055
I don't know.
Maybe.

44:41.057 --> 44:43.826
I don't think so. I mean,
he was always with Emile.

44:44.527 --> 44:46.327
They were like brothers.

44:46.329 --> 44:48.629
You know,
every day we make decisions.

44:48.631 --> 44:50.531
Big ones, small ones...

44:50.533 --> 44:55.437
It all adds up, 'til one day
you... You know what I mean?

44:58.974 --> 45:02.075
But the last time
that Stefan was here,

45:02.077 --> 45:03.743
he and Emile
had an argument.

45:03.745 --> 45:05.712
I don't know
what it was about,

45:05.714 --> 45:08.181
but right before
Stefan left,

45:08.183 --> 45:10.883
he kissed Emile
on the mouth.

45:10.885 --> 45:12.587
Like this.

45:15.023 --> 45:16.288
Weird, right?

45:45.385 --> 45:47.485
The reason why no one
remembers Korea anymore

45:47.487 --> 45:48.720
is because
it had no look.

45:48.722 --> 45:50.855
World War II looked like
a fucking Dior runway.

45:50.857 --> 45:53.924
Vietnam, fucking brilliant.
Sexy, sweaty.

45:53.926 --> 45:56.126
Korea? I mean, sorry.

45:56.128 --> 45:58.161
I can't think
of a single image,

45:58.163 --> 45:59.196
which is why
no one knows

45:59.198 --> 46:00.798
what that fucking war
was about.

46:01.534 --> 46:02.834
Can you hear it?

46:02.836 --> 46:04.770
Lossless WAV file.

46:06.037 --> 46:07.337
Like vinyl.

46:07.339 --> 46:08.871
Fucking hell.

46:08.873 --> 46:10.975
Fucking hell.

46:11.410 --> 46:13.176
Cheeky bird.

46:13.178 --> 46:14.680
Come here.

46:32.229 --> 46:33.664
Do you like New Wave?

46:35.065 --> 46:36.534
Stefan loved New Wave

46:39.002 --> 46:41.571
I didn't realize you two
were such good friends.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.073
Come on.

46:45.075 --> 46:47.275
You know as well as me

46:47.277 --> 46:49.511
Anneke kept him
on a tight leash.

46:49.513 --> 46:51.848
I was not so good
for his image.

46:53.884 --> 46:56.452
So many people claimed
to be his friends,

46:57.286 --> 46:58.921
he never mentioned you.

46:59.723 --> 47:01.658
You know,
I don't blame you.

47:03.559 --> 47:05.258
I never did.

47:05.260 --> 47:06.961
Not for leaving him.
Not for anything.

47:08.364 --> 47:10.466
I know he was here
the night he died.

47:12.468 --> 47:13.968
And he called you.

47:15.270 --> 47:17.570
Why?

47:17.572 --> 47:19.774
Why don't you come a little closer.
I can hardly hear you.

47:23.578 --> 47:25.246
You're gonna make
me come to you.

47:26.314 --> 47:27.882
Like a little cat.

47:29.851 --> 47:30.984
I like cats.

47:33.987 --> 47:36.021
Who was the woman
in the photo?

47:37.425 --> 47:38.793
Did she work for you?

47:40.461 --> 47:42.663
Mona.

47:43.996 --> 47:45.265
Mona?

48:02.583 --> 48:04.280
What is that?

48:04.282 --> 48:07.152
Heroin with
a little MDMA.

48:09.020 --> 48:11.056
Honestly, by the nose,
it hardly affects you.

48:34.211 --> 48:36.213
I know this song.

48:41.685 --> 48:43.852
You smell
like the sun.

48:43.854 --> 48:45.088
Hmm.

48:59.135 --> 49:00.336
Who's Mona?

49:01.672 --> 49:03.740
We grew up together,
Stefan and I.

49:04.474 --> 49:06.373
Did you know that?

49:06.375 --> 49:07.944
We spent
every summer together.

49:09.746 --> 49:11.347
My mother would
put me on a ferry

49:12.080 --> 49:13.349
from Dover to Calais,

49:14.551 --> 49:15.715
and my father
would pick me up

49:15.717 --> 49:17.753
and we would drive
all the way to London.

49:20.122 --> 49:21.189
And that was that.

49:22.491 --> 49:23.927
June to September.

49:26.361 --> 49:28.931
No shoes. No rules.

49:29.898 --> 49:31.731
Just us.

49:31.733 --> 49:33.934
Running wild
at the beach.

49:33.936 --> 49:35.637
I didn't know that.

49:38.874 --> 49:40.741
And Stefan had
a little cat.

49:42.543 --> 49:43.778
Named Mona.

49:45.813 --> 49:47.281
She was so happy.

49:48.816 --> 49:51.685
Like us. Running around,

49:53.119 --> 49:54.621
laying in the sun.

49:55.957 --> 49:57.190
So free.

50:01.062 --> 50:04.831
And when they moved to
the city, she got so sad.

50:06.231 --> 50:07.867
So she stopped eating.

50:08.802 --> 50:10.904
She stopped drinking.

50:14.774 --> 50:16.342
Mona is a cat?

50:23.148 --> 50:24.951
She would just...

50:27.820 --> 50:29.855
She would just sleep
all day long.

50:35.628 --> 50:38.129
And one day
we called her.

50:41.365 --> 50:43.368
"Kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

50:44.502 --> 50:46.636
"Kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty."

50:46.638 --> 50:48.373
Kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

50:52.175 --> 50:53.377
She didn't come.

50:54.778 --> 50:56.813
She died
of a broken heart.

50:59.683 --> 51:01.182
I think when you die,

51:01.184 --> 51:03.754
you leave something of yourself
with the people you love.

51:05.421 --> 51:06.957
And you see him in me.

51:13.329 --> 51:14.865
Why did he call you?

51:17.533 --> 51:18.934
He wanted my help.

51:24.340 --> 51:25.808
With what?

51:29.277 --> 51:30.478
Pulling the trigger.

51:39.120 --> 51:41.321
You're not supposed
to touch that.

51:43.357 --> 51:44.824
What did you say?

51:46.928 --> 51:49.431
No one touches
my controls.

51:51.166 --> 51:52.698
Hey, hey, Frieda.

51:52.700 --> 51:54.733
- Controls.
- Shut the fucking bird up.

51:54.735 --> 51:56.735
No one touches
my controls.

51:56.737 --> 51:58.236
- You!
- Controls.

51:58.238 --> 52:01.239
- Chill out, man. We're just having a laugh.
- We're just having fun.

52:01.241 --> 52:03.875
Get out of my club,
you fucking pervert.

52:03.877 --> 52:06.044
- Everything's fine.
- No, it's not the fucking same.

52:06.046 --> 52:07.112
What's that
you fucking nutter?

52:07.114 --> 52:09.014
Don't tell me.
I paid good money.

52:09.016 --> 52:10.481
I don't care
about your fucking money.

52:14.421 --> 52:16.989
Frieda, for fuck's sake,
shut the fucking bird up.

52:17.390 --> 52:19.056
Hey, get out!

52:21.561 --> 52:23.130
You're fucking crazy, man.

52:29.868 --> 52:31.436
What's your problem?

52:34.239 --> 52:35.540
Why did you do that?

52:56.194 --> 52:58.196
<i>Why did he call you?</i>

53:00.798 --> 53:02.399
<i>He wanted my help.</i>

53:05.602 --> 53:07.138
<i>With what?</i>

53:10.608 --> 53:12.143
<i>Pulling the trigger.</i>

53:22.786 --> 53:24.053
Hey.

53:28.390 --> 53:29.324
You all right?

53:31.393 --> 53:32.394
Need a ride?

53:34.130 --> 53:36.764
Okay, I'll guess, I'll, uh,

53:36.766 --> 53:40.066
leave you to do whatever fine
thing it is you're doing now.

53:40.068 --> 53:42.569
Wait, wait,
I do need a ride.

53:42.571 --> 53:44.472
I just need to sit
here for a minute.

53:48.309 --> 53:49.411
Okay.

54:06.326 --> 54:07.995
Oh, whoa.

54:10.630 --> 54:11.730
Oh.

54:11.732 --> 54:12.731
Don't look.

54:12.733 --> 54:14.001
Uh, okay.

54:14.702 --> 54:17.304
Oh, God.

54:19.306 --> 54:21.007
Take your time,
it'll pass.

54:26.214 --> 54:28.380
Here.

54:33.686 --> 54:34.988
There we go.

55:04.983 --> 55:06.349
Good night.

55:06.351 --> 55:07.384
Hey.

55:18.762 --> 55:20.297
Night, night.

55:21.331 --> 55:23.331
- Gimme that leg.
- Huh?

55:23.333 --> 55:24.633
I want that leg.

55:25.736 --> 55:27.503
- Stop it.
- I can't.

55:29.739 --> 55:31.906
I gotta go.

55:33.743 --> 55:35.377
Okay, then,
I'll come with you.

55:35.379 --> 55:37.312
You're gonna come
with me to London?

55:37.314 --> 55:38.447
Yeah.

55:41.350 --> 55:42.450
All right.

55:43.119 --> 55:45.618
And I go to New York?

55:45.620 --> 55:47.189
Then I'll follow
you there.

55:49.859 --> 55:51.559
I'd follow you
all over the world.

55:55.630 --> 55:56.998
I've got you,

55:57.899 --> 56:00.135
and I'm never gonna
let you go.

56:14.548 --> 56:15.648
Housekeeping.

56:17.217 --> 56:19.420
No, thank you.

56:26.493 --> 56:27.560
Housekeeping.

56:28.329 --> 56:29.694
No, thank you.

56:46.346 --> 56:47.647
Coming.

56:52.684 --> 56:54.084
Yeah?

56:54.086 --> 56:56.088
<i>Hey, what's going on?
Did she go in yet?</i>

56:58.724 --> 56:59.689
<i>Hello?</i>

56:59.691 --> 57:00.623
Uh...

57:00.625 --> 57:02.395
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I'm here.

57:02.793 --> 57:04.093
I'm there.

57:04.095 --> 57:05.596
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Um...

57:06.864 --> 57:08.599
I think...

57:09.767 --> 57:11.301
<i>Hey?</i>

57:11.303 --> 57:12.701
Can I call you back
in a second?

57:12.703 --> 57:14.306
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

57:20.378 --> 57:21.379
Shit!

57:23.781 --> 57:25.180
Anneke!

57:25.182 --> 57:27.048
Anneke, I need
the number for 911.

57:27.050 --> 57:29.183
I need a doctor.
I need an ambulance.

57:29.185 --> 57:31.219
<i>Slow down. Slow down.</i>

57:31.221 --> 57:32.620
<i>Tell me, what's going on?</i>

57:32.622 --> 57:34.522
I think he's dead.

57:34.524 --> 57:38.959
Oh, God, I fucked up.
I fucked up.

57:38.961 --> 57:40.497
I left him.
I left him alone.

57:41.530 --> 57:42.863
Stop it.

57:42.865 --> 57:44.798
Katherine, stop. Stop!

57:44.800 --> 57:46.934
Listen to me, goddammit.

57:46.936 --> 57:48.202
<i>Hide the drugs.
Hide it all.</i>

57:48.204 --> 57:49.871
<i>Hide anything
that will hurt him.</i>

57:51.572 --> 57:52.441
Do it!

57:52.975 --> 57:53.940
<i>Do it now!</i>

57:53.942 --> 57:55.577
Okay, okay.

58:42.956 --> 58:44.788
Everything
went very well.

58:44.790 --> 58:46.592
No complications whatsoever.

58:47.527 --> 58:50.095
She will remain in ICU
on the phenobarbital

58:50.097 --> 58:51.530
<i>for the next few days.</i>

58:56.769 --> 58:59.573
<i>You know, you've never
really told me what happened.</i>

59:03.141 --> 59:04.274
There's nothing really to say.

59:04.276 --> 59:06.245
I mean, you know what happened.

59:10.483 --> 59:12.184
You know,
I love you, right?

59:12.951 --> 59:14.251
Of course,
and I love you, too.

59:14.253 --> 59:15.485
I don't need
to hear your say it.

59:15.487 --> 59:16.919
That's not what
this is about.

59:16.921 --> 59:18.156
I know you do.

59:20.291 --> 59:22.657
<i>I know what happened hurt.</i>

59:22.659 --> 59:26.195
<i>But I cannot let you
do this to yourself.</i>

59:26.197 --> 59:28.498
It's like you swam
out to sea,

59:28.500 --> 59:30.600
and I'm watching you
from the shore,

59:30.602 --> 59:32.067
waiting for you
to come back.

59:32.069 --> 59:34.836
And you are so far away.

59:34.838 --> 59:37.473
I can barely see you.

59:37.475 --> 59:39.740
And I just want
to scream at you

59:39.742 --> 59:42.009
and tell you there is
good in this world

59:42.011 --> 59:43.677
and love,

59:43.679 --> 59:45.182
and beautiful things.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.219
I did the best I could.

59:52.488 --> 59:56.123
And I'm so sorry I couldn't
protect you from everything.

01:00:00.497 --> 01:00:02.265
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:00:32.726 --> 01:00:33.894
Not so fast.

01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:36.665
I think you owe me
a drink.

01:00:57.183 --> 01:00:58.684
- So...
- Uh, what?

01:00:58.686 --> 01:01:01.118
Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
I didn't mean to cut you off.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.986
Did you want a drink?

01:01:02.988 --> 01:01:04.721
Well, I have a drink.

01:01:04.723 --> 01:01:05.757
You want a drink?

01:01:06.459 --> 01:01:07.893
- Yes.
- Oh, Okay.

01:01:09.562 --> 01:01:10.561
Right, uh,

01:01:10.563 --> 01:01:13.164
can I have a drink
for my friend, please?

01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:14.666
- Scotch okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:01:18.936 --> 01:01:20.305
You like steak?

01:01:21.106 --> 01:01:22.341
Here.

01:01:22.773 --> 01:01:24.009
Have some.

01:01:27.345 --> 01:01:28.944
Enjoy it.

01:01:28.946 --> 01:01:30.314
Enjoy your meal.

01:01:31.215 --> 01:01:33.082
That's what they say here.

01:01:33.084 --> 01:01:37.253
Have you noticed a lot of Flemish
words sound like what they mean?

01:01:37.255 --> 01:01:40.456
<i>Smakelijk</i> means
something that tastes good.

01:01:40.458 --> 01:01:43.626
But saying it feels like that.
You know what I mean?

01:01:43.628 --> 01:01:46.161
Well, it's not just in Flemish.
We have that, too.

01:01:46.163 --> 01:01:47.531
"Curve" is like that.

01:01:47.864 --> 01:01:48.932
Hmm?

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:52.333
The word "curve".

01:01:52.335 --> 01:01:54.037
Sounds and feels
like what it means.

01:01:55.138 --> 01:01:56.539
Hmm.

01:02:00.076 --> 01:02:01.378
All right.

01:02:02.245 --> 01:02:03.580
Pierce.

01:02:06.815 --> 01:02:07.950
Slide.

01:02:11.321 --> 01:02:12.656
Anguish.

01:02:20.262 --> 01:02:21.597
Rumple.

01:02:26.934 --> 01:02:28.036
Burden.

01:02:29.904 --> 01:02:31.439
That's good.

01:02:31.973 --> 01:02:33.341
I like that one.

01:02:38.146 --> 01:02:40.879
So what are you
doing in town?

01:02:40.881 --> 01:02:42.617
Other than behaving badly?

01:02:44.686 --> 01:02:47.622
Funny, peel back a layer and
no one's who they seem to be.

01:02:50.457 --> 01:02:52.059
Now one's ever
how they seem to be.

01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:58.596
For example, you don't
seem like the kind of guy

01:02:58.598 --> 01:03:01.635
who would need to pay a woman
to have dinner with him.

01:03:03.336 --> 01:03:04.535
I'm not paying you.

01:03:04.537 --> 01:03:06.005
Well, that's the difference.
You would.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.942
I wouldn't pay you
to have dinner.

01:03:12.779 --> 01:03:14.913
Can I interest you in
any dessert or chocolate?

01:03:15.614 --> 01:03:17.414
Hmm.

01:03:17.416 --> 01:03:20.117
Dessert and chocolate,
no thanks.

01:03:20.119 --> 01:03:21.853
Charge it
to my room, 608.

01:03:22.455 --> 01:03:23.954
That's my room.

01:03:23.956 --> 01:03:25.189
Hmm.

01:03:25.191 --> 01:03:26.389
I don't know
why I keep doing that.

01:03:26.391 --> 01:03:27.926
I must want to be
in that room.

01:03:28.426 --> 01:03:30.161
Room 607.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.901
Now you know
where to find me.

01:04:00.491 --> 01:04:02.556
This is for
the deed on the house.

01:04:02.558 --> 01:04:04.093
You need to sign here.

01:04:08.931 --> 01:04:10.900
And here.

01:04:13.903 --> 01:04:14.934
And these documents

01:04:14.936 --> 01:04:18.006
are for you to add Anneke
to the joint account.

01:04:19.575 --> 01:04:21.175
We didn't have
a joint account.

01:04:21.177 --> 01:04:22.777
The week
before he died,

01:04:22.779 --> 01:04:25.515
Stefan transferred almost half a
million euro into a new account.

01:04:26.281 --> 01:04:27.616
You were listed
on that account.

01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:30.049
I am not.

01:04:30.051 --> 01:04:32.485
If you wish to make a claim
on that money, you may do so,

01:04:32.487 --> 01:04:34.656
but I don't see why you would.
It wasn't yours.

01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:37.557
I thought you handled
all of the, uh...

01:04:37.559 --> 01:04:40.595
Do you or don't you want to
make a claim on that account?

01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:42.462
I have bill
and debt to pay.

01:04:42.464 --> 01:04:44.397
His bills. His debt.

01:04:44.399 --> 01:04:45.834
It didn't just stop.

01:04:48.235 --> 01:04:49.638
I need that money.

01:05:05.552 --> 01:05:07.721
You mind if I take these
with me to look over?

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:09.621
It's fine.

01:05:09.623 --> 01:05:11.191
I just need to be
at the hospital soon.

01:05:12.258 --> 01:05:13.761
I'll bring them
to you later.

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.496
Yes.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.429
How is she doing?

01:05:18.431 --> 01:05:19.866
She's fine.
She's getting better.

01:05:23.068 --> 01:05:24.571
Well, then...

01:05:25.738 --> 01:05:27.004
Okay.

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.075
Come.

01:05:53.364 --> 01:05:56.532
<i>Do you know who he
might have been hanging out with?</i>

01:05:56.534 --> 01:05:58.169
Or where he might have gone?

01:05:59.837 --> 01:06:02.470
Did you notice
anything unusual

01:06:02.472 --> 01:06:03.875
<i>about his behavior
in the last few days?</i>

01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:06.876
<i>Your mother-in-law says</i>

01:06:06.878 --> 01:06:09.712
that the two of you were
in the process of separating.

01:06:09.714 --> 01:06:12.115
<i>Is it possible that had
something to do with this?</i>

01:06:38.106 --> 01:06:40.172
<i>What
the fuck is going on? 1</i>

01:06:40.174 --> 01:06:41.374
<i>This is ridiculous, Kate.</i>

01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:43.242
<i>I even called
the hospital.</i>

01:06:43.244 --> 01:06:44.143
I'm sorry.

01:06:44.145 --> 01:06:45.646
<i>Can you stop saying sorry?</i>

01:06:45.648 --> 01:06:48.080
<i>'Cause you're clearly
not sorry.</i>

01:06:48.082 --> 01:06:50.516
<i>You know that she wouldn't even
be there if it weren't for you.</i>

01:06:50.518 --> 01:06:52.285
<i>If you had just dealt
with your shit</i>

01:06:52.287 --> 01:06:55.155
<i>like a normal person, none of
this would have ever happened.</i>

01:06:55.723 --> 01:06:57.256
<i>I would think</i>

01:06:57.258 --> 01:06:58.457
<i>that by now</i>

01:06:58.459 --> 01:07:01.060
<i>you would appreciate
the people in your life</i>

01:07:01.062 --> 01:07:02.296
<i>a little bit more.</i>

01:07:03.864 --> 01:07:04.897
I do.

01:07:04.899 --> 01:07:06.066
<i>Then you better
start showing it.</i>

01:07:07.634 --> 01:07:10.270
<i>Okay, did you fax
the insurance company?</i>

01:07:11.138 --> 01:07:12.372
Yeah.

01:07:15.174 --> 01:07:17.542
<i>Kate? Hello?</i>

01:07:17.544 --> 01:07:18.710
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

01:07:18.712 --> 01:07:20.814
Yeah, yeah,
I'm on it, um...

01:07:21.882 --> 01:07:23.917
It's kind of late here,
can I call you back?

01:07:25.652 --> 01:07:28.152
<i>Kate, hello?
Are you there?</i>

01:07:40.866 --> 01:07:42.733
For a second I thought
you were room service,

01:07:42.735 --> 01:07:44.971
but then I realized
I didn't order anything.

01:07:46.572 --> 01:07:48.373
You want to come in?
Have a drink?

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.815
I hope you don't want ice.

01:07:57.983 --> 01:08:00.416
They never fill
the damn minibar, but,

01:08:00.418 --> 01:08:02.053
got a bottle
from the store.

01:08:03.721 --> 01:08:06.355
Lesson number one
of a seasoned traveler.

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:11.896
Do you wanna
have sex with me?

01:08:16.499 --> 01:08:19.265
Is that
a theoretical question?

01:08:19.268 --> 01:08:21.904
Doesn't have to mean anything,
it can just be tonight.

01:08:23.107 --> 01:08:24.707
Who decides that?

01:08:31.314 --> 01:08:32.749
You're serious, are ya?

01:08:36.252 --> 01:08:37.386
Why?

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.255
Don't you do this
all the time?

01:08:41.957 --> 01:08:43.358
I don't do this
all the time.

01:08:52.433 --> 01:08:54.567
Keep staring at me like that,
I'm gonna change my mind.

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:56.136
No, hey, I'm sorry.

01:08:56.138 --> 01:08:57.339
It's just a bit...

01:08:59.006 --> 01:09:00.108
Right now?

01:09:01.676 --> 01:09:03.010
Right now, okay.

01:09:04.444 --> 01:09:05.479
Uh...

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:07.578
Can I...

01:09:07.581 --> 01:09:09.885
Are there rules?
Can I kiss you or...

01:09:10.618 --> 01:09:12.720
Uh, yeah, like...

01:09:13.187 --> 01:09:14.453
Just normal.

01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:17.622
Okay.

01:09:17.624 --> 01:09:20.024
Well, this isn't normal,

01:09:20.027 --> 01:09:22.129
but I'll...
I'll do my best.

01:10:48.145 --> 01:10:50.378
I saw you at that club
the other night.

01:10:51.947 --> 01:10:53.714
Why do you go there?

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:55.716
Uh, I travel a lot.

01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:57.553
It gets lonely.
You get bored.

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:00.856
You want someone
to talk to.

01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:04.260
But not someone you got
to talk to tomorrow.

01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:08.363
What about you?

01:11:09.764 --> 01:11:12.600
Uh, my husband
used to go there.

01:11:15.803 --> 01:11:18.805
Oh, is that why you're here?
Playing detective?

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:22.476
No, it just
worked out like that.

01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:24.913
Faith.

01:11:25.445 --> 01:11:26.580
What?

01:11:27.181 --> 01:11:28.947
Faith.

01:11:28.949 --> 01:11:30.515
Some things are
just meant to be.

01:11:30.517 --> 01:11:31.952
Like me being
next door.

01:11:33.587 --> 01:11:35.086
That's just convenient.

01:11:35.088 --> 01:11:36.755
There's a difference.

01:11:36.757 --> 01:11:38.124
I gotta go.

01:11:43.563 --> 01:11:45.529
I hope I see you around.

01:11:45.531 --> 01:11:47.067
Yeah, I'll be around.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.100
Yeah, yeah,
I guess you're

01:11:50.102 --> 01:11:52.604
not going far enough
to justify pants.

01:12:15.126 --> 01:12:17.359
<i>So, I know
what everyone is thinking.</i>

01:12:17.361 --> 01:12:19.796
So let's just cut
to the chase, huh?

01:12:20.832 --> 01:12:22.098
<i>Steel Chase.</i>

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.867
What drew you to it?

01:12:23.869 --> 01:12:26.735
<i>Well, there's... There's
excitement in uncertainty, isn't there?</i>

01:12:26.737 --> 01:12:29.673
<i>Um, it's quite boring to
be the same all the time.</i>

01:12:32.343 --> 01:12:33.475
<i>And I'm lucky,</i>

01:12:33.477 --> 01:12:35.579
<i>because with every role
I get to become</i>

01:12:36.614 --> 01:12:37.546
someone new.

01:12:37.548 --> 01:12:39.350
Or at least live in
their skin for a while.

01:12:42.886 --> 01:12:45.153
<i>And</i> Steel Chase <i>is fun</i>

01:12:45.155 --> 01:12:46.420
because I get
to play a criminal.

01:12:46.422 --> 01:12:49.490
Uh-huh, and we have
a little clip of you

01:12:49.492 --> 01:12:50.858
preparing for the role.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.827
<i>It looks quite difficult.</i>

01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:09.578
Bad guys are always
most fun to play.

01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:21.223
<i>And we can learn a lot
from desperate people.</i>

01:13:26.626 --> 01:13:28.227
Now, you have a
10-year recurring role

01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:31.597
on the Belgian
soap opera <i>Amour Secret.</i>

01:13:31.599 --> 01:13:34.967
Yes? Tell us
a little bit about it.

01:13:34.969 --> 01:13:37.202
Well, it was the
beginning of my career.

01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:39.072
So, it'll always
be special.

01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:41.472
Like a first love.

01:13:41.474 --> 01:13:43.841
And I think that's what
that role was about.

01:13:43.843 --> 01:13:47.946
About falling in love like it's
the first time every few months.

01:13:49.782 --> 01:13:51.715
<i>Yeah, it was crazy.</i>

01:13:51.717 --> 01:13:55.787
<i>I think in real life you only get to
fall in love like that once or twice,</i>

01:13:55.789 --> 01:13:57.088
<i>you...</i>

01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:58.823
<i>If you're lucky.</i>

01:13:58.825 --> 01:14:00.490
<i>Wonderful.</i>

01:14:00.492 --> 01:14:02.328
<i>We'll be right back
after this.</i>

01:14:07.599 --> 01:14:09.599
<i>Nearly
a year after the sudden death</i>

01:14:09.601 --> 01:14:10.968
<i>of the beloved Belgian actor,</i>

01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:12.769
<i>there are still
unanswered questions.</i>

01:14:12.771 --> 01:14:15.604
<i>Just days after photographs
of Delvoe and a mystery woman</i>

01:14:15.606 --> 01:14:18.075
<i>were anonymously leaked
to the press,</i>

01:14:18.077 --> 01:14:21.013
<i>his body was found,
gunshot to the head.</i>

01:14:21.679 --> 01:14:22.913
<i>But who was this woman?</i>

01:14:22.915 --> 01:14:24.647
<i>And who leaked
these photographs?</i>

01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:26.048
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:14:26.050 --> 01:14:28.184
<i>The photographer
behind this camera has the answers.</i>

01:14:28.186 --> 01:14:30.119
<i>Whoever has identified
the two</i>

01:14:30.121 --> 01:14:33.091
<i>is yet another missing piece
of the growing puzzle.</i>

01:14:44.634 --> 01:14:46.668
Am I disturbing you?

01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:48.237
I was actually in the
middle of something.

01:14:48.239 --> 01:14:49.739
Hey, open this up
a little more, huh?

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:51.741
I can't fit through here.

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.081
What is all this?

01:14:59.783 --> 01:15:01.383
- See this?
- Hmm.

01:15:01.385 --> 01:15:02.585
And this.

01:15:06.789 --> 01:15:08.357
Nah, I can't see for shit.

01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:12.126
My wife's been telling me
to get glasses for years,

01:15:12.128 --> 01:15:14.497
but, uh,
I'm too vain for that.

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:22.604
You're married?

01:15:25.374 --> 01:15:27.308
Kind of on the skids
right now.

01:15:35.316 --> 01:15:37.584
You don't exactly
act married.

01:15:40.687 --> 01:15:41.789
Do you love her?

01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:44.325
Of course,
I love her.

01:15:45.659 --> 01:15:47.592
Why do you fuck around?

01:15:47.594 --> 01:15:48.829
Does she know?

01:15:49.562 --> 01:15:50.663
No.

01:15:51.898 --> 01:15:55.701
Uh, the two things have
nothing to do with each other.

01:15:56.403 --> 01:15:58.937
Yeah, right.

01:15:58.939 --> 01:16:00.472
What? Do you think...

01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:02.173
Because I sleep
with one person,

01:16:02.175 --> 01:16:03.841
it changes how I feel
about another?

01:16:03.843 --> 01:16:05.311
- Doesn't it?
- No.

01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:07.845
No.

01:16:07.847 --> 01:16:09.680
I just don't think you
can really love someone

01:16:09.682 --> 01:16:12.718
and maintain a whole
secret life on the side.

01:16:14.586 --> 01:16:15.887
Yeah.

01:16:22.228 --> 01:16:24.061
Well, have you ever
been in love?

01:16:24.063 --> 01:16:25.894
I mean, really
deeply in love?

01:16:25.896 --> 01:16:26.963
I was married.

01:16:26.965 --> 01:16:28.200
Not the same thing.

01:16:29.434 --> 01:16:30.734
How long
were you married?

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:33.271
Two years.

01:16:33.572 --> 01:16:35.638
Well...

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.574
Talk to me when you
can last a few more.

01:16:37.576 --> 01:16:40.409
I mean, two years, come on, you're
barely out of the gates there...

01:16:40.411 --> 01:16:41.679
He died.

01:16:45.484 --> 01:16:46.518
I'm sorry.

01:16:47.118 --> 01:16:48.386
What happened?

01:16:50.086 --> 01:16:51.388
He...

01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:54.824
He shot himself.

01:16:57.627 --> 01:16:58.496
Why?

01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:02.866
I don't know.

01:17:06.803 --> 01:17:08.536
He was under a lot
of strain at work

01:17:08.538 --> 01:17:10.371
and we were splitting up
at the time.

01:17:10.373 --> 01:17:12.208
I think that pushed him
over the edge.

01:17:15.644 --> 01:17:17.144
So...

01:17:17.146 --> 01:17:19.215
It was gonna end one way
or the other, right?

01:17:19.882 --> 01:17:21.014
God.

01:17:21.016 --> 01:17:22.682
It's okay, look.

01:17:22.684 --> 01:17:23.852
All I'm saying is...

01:17:25.587 --> 01:17:28.624
There's a reason you gotta
find some comfort when you can

01:17:30.626 --> 01:17:32.294
and love the one
you're with.

01:17:37.332 --> 01:17:38.733
Love the one you're with?

01:17:41.836 --> 01:17:44.303
Wow, I thought we were
really talking there,

01:17:44.305 --> 01:17:47.273
and you just turned it
into a bumper sticker.

01:17:47.275 --> 01:17:49.408
I was just trying
to lighten the mood.

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:51.176
What's so bad
about that?

01:17:51.178 --> 01:17:52.677
You're so full of shit.

01:17:52.679 --> 01:17:54.814
It's just an excuse so you can
sleep with whoever you want.

01:17:55.483 --> 01:17:57.082
Not because you're lonely,

01:17:57.084 --> 01:17:58.586
because you want
to be alone.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.386
Interesting theory.

01:18:01.388 --> 01:18:04.324
In this particular case,
it takes one to know one.

01:18:09.563 --> 01:18:11.162
I'm tired.

01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:12.864
- Okay.
- I was in the middle of something.

01:18:12.866 --> 01:18:14.064
See, you're doing it
right now.

01:18:14.066 --> 01:18:15.265
I'm not doing anything.

01:18:15.267 --> 01:18:16.467
I just want to be alone.

01:18:16.469 --> 01:18:17.870
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

01:18:19.372 --> 01:18:20.505
Okay, fine, whatever.

01:18:20.507 --> 01:18:22.139
I'll just pretend
it never happened.

01:18:22.141 --> 01:18:23.476
Okay.

01:18:30.115 --> 01:18:31.450
No, you know what?

01:18:32.484 --> 01:18:34.486
This is stupid. I'm...

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:37.887
I'm gonna try something.
I'm gonna be honest.

01:18:37.889 --> 01:18:39.656
Okay? I like you.

01:18:39.658 --> 01:18:41.625
And I don't know why,
I barely know you,

01:18:41.627 --> 01:18:43.361
but I want you
to like me.

01:18:44.262 --> 01:18:46.295
And I know
I'm not perfect,

01:18:46.297 --> 01:18:47.932
but from what
I can tell you're...

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.933
...pretty fucked up, too.

01:18:51.935 --> 01:18:55.640
So, the least we can do
is keep each other company

01:18:58.142 --> 01:18:59.644
and be nice.

01:19:09.253 --> 01:19:10.722
So how about I stay?

01:19:14.725 --> 01:19:15.791
Okay.

01:19:17.093 --> 01:19:18.060
Okay?

01:19:20.530 --> 01:19:21.565
Yeah.

01:19:22.566 --> 01:19:23.700
Okay.

01:19:26.535 --> 01:19:27.670
Hmm.

01:19:37.812 --> 01:19:39.948
<i>If you were an
animal, what would you be?</i>

01:19:40.949 --> 01:19:42.949
<i>And don't say bird.</i>

01:19:42.951 --> 01:19:45.753
<i>Why not?</i>

01:19:45.755 --> 01:19:47.956
<i>Because everyone
always picks a bird.</i>

01:19:49.323 --> 01:19:51.056
I would
want to be a bird.

01:19:51.058 --> 01:19:52.059
No, see.

01:19:55.664 --> 01:19:57.664
People...

01:19:57.666 --> 01:20:00.099
They look up in the sky
and they see a bird...

01:20:00.101 --> 01:20:01.566
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:01.568 --> 01:20:05.973
Its wings all stretched out
and still.

01:20:07.807 --> 01:20:11.076
It looks like it's just
coasting along.

01:20:11.078 --> 01:20:12.110
Just floating
through the air,

01:20:12.112 --> 01:20:13.379
not a care
in the world.

01:20:16.849 --> 01:20:18.485
Those birds,

01:20:19.586 --> 01:20:21.789
they're looking down at us
and saying, "Shit,

01:20:22.523 --> 01:20:24.425
I wish I had hands.

01:20:36.135 --> 01:20:37.636
I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.776
But I'll be back
in a few days.

01:20:45.745 --> 01:20:47.444
Can I call you up
and take you out

01:20:47.446 --> 01:20:48.614
to dinner
when I get back?

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:50.848
You don't have to.

01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:53.585
I know I don't have to,
I want to.

01:20:55.019 --> 01:20:56.087
I like you.

01:21:01.359 --> 01:21:02.493
I like you, too.

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:18.642
Is there a problem?

01:21:24.849 --> 01:21:27.749
She has a little fluid
in her left lung.

01:21:27.751 --> 01:21:28.949
We should give her
some antibiotics.

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:30.754
It should clear up
in a couple of days.

01:21:34.057 --> 01:21:35.525
Fuck.

01:22:44.858 --> 01:22:46.058
Whoa.

01:23:10.415 --> 01:23:11.547
Yeah?

01:23:11.549 --> 01:23:13.648
Hi, my husband,
Stefan Delvoe,

01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:15.116
used to work
with a trainer here.

01:23:15.118 --> 01:23:16.284
I'd like to speak
with him.

01:23:16.286 --> 01:23:17.686
What was the name?

01:23:17.688 --> 01:23:19.120
Uh, I don't know
his name.

01:23:19.122 --> 01:23:21.024
No, no,
your husband's name.

01:23:22.025 --> 01:23:23.160
Stefan Delvoe.

01:23:23.962 --> 01:23:25.161
The actor?

01:23:32.201 --> 01:23:35.270
Stof.

01:23:35.272 --> 01:23:38.908
I had worked with him for about
two months for S <i>teel Chase.</i>

01:23:39.609 --> 01:23:41.077
He showed up everyday.

01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:42.776
He was
very professional.

01:23:42.778 --> 01:23:44.378
Didn't seem
depressed at all.

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:46.048
At all.

01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:49.349
So he seemed
okay to you?

01:23:49.351 --> 01:23:52.720
He was working.
He had plans.

01:23:52.722 --> 01:23:56.224
He didn't seem like someone
who was about to, you know.

01:23:58.828 --> 01:23:59.929
Look.

01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:05.600
The media, they tell you
what you want to hear, huh?

01:24:06.368 --> 01:24:07.800
They spin the story
that works,

01:24:07.802 --> 01:24:10.904
but the truth,
it always come out.

01:24:10.906 --> 01:24:12.707
What do you mean?

01:24:13.207 --> 01:24:15.073
It's the details.

01:24:15.075 --> 01:24:16.043
They don't add up.

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:19.113
Just look a little closer.

01:24:22.049 --> 01:24:23.952
The gun was
in the wrong hand.

01:24:24.518 --> 01:24:26.183
Doesn't add up.

01:24:26.185 --> 01:24:27.353
Doesn't make sense.

01:24:28.889 --> 01:24:30.056
See?

01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:37.428
Hey, miss.

01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:39.630
His membership
expired last month.

01:24:39.632 --> 01:24:41.968
If he doesn't renew, we need
to clear out his locker.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:47.505
People think they can leave
their shit here forever,

01:24:47.507 --> 01:24:49.974
then they get upset
when we throw it away,

01:24:49.976 --> 01:24:51.643
but it's policy.

01:24:52.244 --> 01:24:53.846
It's in the contract.

01:25:46.363 --> 01:25:48.997
See? He's holding the gun
with his right hand,

01:25:48.999 --> 01:25:51.198
but the shot went
into his left temple.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.434
Stefan was left-handed.

01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:55.135
Yes, I know that,

01:25:55.137 --> 01:25:57.805
but he's holding the gun
with his right hand.

01:25:57.807 --> 01:26:00.907
It's very common to be
ambidextrous with firearms.

01:26:00.909 --> 01:26:02.843
And the forensics
on the hands show...

01:26:02.845 --> 01:26:05.179
What about the second shot?
No one ever explained that.

01:26:07.716 --> 01:26:09.349
Diazepam,

01:26:09.351 --> 01:26:10.517
heroin,

01:26:10.519 --> 01:26:12.452
alcohol, Klonopin,

01:26:12.454 --> 01:26:13.619
nicotine, Valium,

01:26:13.621 --> 01:26:15.921
all of these were found
in his blood stream.

01:26:15.923 --> 01:26:19.725
It's shocking he could pick
up a gun, much less aim.

01:26:19.727 --> 01:26:21.895
But Emile was there
that morning.

01:26:21.897 --> 01:26:24.263
You said you think
you saw him.

01:26:24.265 --> 01:26:26.766
Don't you see,
he was being followed.

01:26:26.768 --> 01:26:29.434
He moved all of his money
out of Anneke's account

01:26:29.436 --> 01:26:32.972
a week before he died and put
it in a fucking gym locker.

01:26:32.974 --> 01:26:34.607
Then this photographer

01:26:34.609 --> 01:26:36.609
vanishes into thin air?

01:26:36.611 --> 01:26:38.410
The photographer's name
is Christoff Makhtan.

01:26:38.412 --> 01:26:41.980
And Anneke wished to quiet that
situation quickly after Stefan's death.

01:26:41.982 --> 01:26:44.416
And so she paid him
a handsome settlement

01:26:44.418 --> 01:26:45.850
and set him up
at <i>Le Figaro</i>

01:26:45.852 --> 01:26:48.219
under the condition that
he would not press charges

01:26:48.221 --> 01:26:49.455
or speak to the press.

01:26:51.925 --> 01:26:53.759
Why didn't anybody
tell me this?

01:26:55.162 --> 01:26:56.262
You were gone.

01:27:00.634 --> 01:27:02.132
Doesn't explain
the money.

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:04.702
And the woman
in the photographs?

01:27:04.704 --> 01:27:06.737
Or do you know her, too?

01:27:06.739 --> 01:27:08.174
There are always
loose ends.

01:27:09.274 --> 01:27:11.709
But Stefan Delvoe is...

01:27:11.711 --> 01:27:13.943
Is important
to the national identity.

01:27:13.945 --> 01:27:17.149
We all have a responsibility
to protect his image.

01:27:21.053 --> 01:27:22.320
What?

01:27:23.155 --> 01:27:24.786
Miss Grant,

01:27:24.788 --> 01:27:27.522
we know you're looking
for answers.

01:27:27.524 --> 01:27:30.660
The death of a loved one
can be a challenging process,

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.995
but let me assure you

01:27:32.997 --> 01:27:35.798
we have ways of knowing
certain things.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.400
There was absolutely
no foul play involved.

01:27:38.402 --> 01:27:40.168
Yes, in fact,
the only foul play involved

01:27:40.170 --> 01:27:41.903
was you tampering
with the evidence.

01:27:41.905 --> 01:27:43.004
Would you like
to talk about that?

01:27:43.006 --> 01:27:44.475
You're
not listening to me.

01:27:45.542 --> 01:27:47.377
Something happened to him.

01:27:49.378 --> 01:27:51.148
Too crazy to figure it out.

01:27:53.516 --> 01:27:55.785
National identity?
Bullshit!

01:28:38.592 --> 01:28:40.559
You call him.

01:28:40.561 --> 01:28:41.929
It's not my problem.

01:28:43.097 --> 01:28:45.831
Well, sort it out. No.

01:28:45.833 --> 01:28:48.333
No, I don't fucking
have anymore.

01:28:48.335 --> 01:28:51.702
Look, please, listen.
I have to open the club.

01:28:51.704 --> 01:28:53.174
Speak to somebody else
about that.

01:28:55.608 --> 01:28:56.707
Jesus.

01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:58.378
Everybody wants
something these days.

01:29:02.115 --> 01:29:04.215
Why do you have
a gun pointed at me?

01:29:04.217 --> 01:29:06.483
I saw you
there that morning.

01:29:06.485 --> 01:29:08.021
I know you
were there.

01:29:09.055 --> 01:29:11.155
He was here
the night before,

01:29:11.157 --> 01:29:13.025
and you were there
that morning.

01:29:14.026 --> 01:29:15.127
Why?

01:29:16.628 --> 01:29:18.231
I saw Anneke
here with you.

01:29:19.364 --> 01:29:20.499
Is she involved?

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.634
And I found the money.

01:29:23.468 --> 01:29:24.934
He was hiding it.

01:29:24.936 --> 01:29:27.872
Hiding it from you,
or her, or...

01:29:28.739 --> 01:29:30.108
Was it about the money?

01:29:31.409 --> 01:29:32.911
Were you blackmailing him?

01:29:33.745 --> 01:29:34.711
Did you kill him?

01:29:34.713 --> 01:29:36.313
Okay, clam down.

01:29:36.315 --> 01:29:38.149
Hey, I'm not fucking
around here.

01:29:38.883 --> 01:29:40.117
I can see that.

01:29:40.985 --> 01:29:42.084
What are you doing?

01:29:42.086 --> 01:29:43.819
I have a fucking gun.

01:29:43.821 --> 01:29:45.654
You don't move.
That's how this works.

01:29:45.656 --> 01:29:47.022
Calm the fuck down.

01:29:47.024 --> 01:29:48.457
I'm on your side.

01:29:51.295 --> 01:29:53.331
You should be angry
at him, not me.

01:29:55.199 --> 01:29:57.168
Stefan was a real
asshole, you know that?

01:29:59.536 --> 01:30:01.069
He had everything.

01:30:01.071 --> 01:30:02.603
A perfect life,

01:30:02.605 --> 01:30:04.373
perfect career
perfect wife.

01:30:05.641 --> 01:30:07.344
Hey, who throws
that away, huh?

01:30:08.979 --> 01:30:11.112
He didn't think anything
of it, I didn't...

01:30:11.114 --> 01:30:13.215
I didn't wanna sell
him that much.

01:30:16.418 --> 01:30:17.586
He was my best friend.

01:30:21.924 --> 01:30:24.225
He was very persuasive.

01:30:24.227 --> 01:30:27.793
So, I just let him have it.

01:30:27.795 --> 01:30:28.996
And when he kissed me
on the mouth

01:30:28.998 --> 01:30:31.432
which I thought was
strange, like he was...

01:30:33.802 --> 01:30:35.170
...saying goodbye.

01:30:36.804 --> 01:30:38.306
And then,
he gave me this.

01:30:40.675 --> 01:30:42.076
He gave me this
to give to you.

01:30:44.145 --> 01:30:45.546
I guess you've
already found it.

01:30:56.257 --> 01:30:58.190
That morning,
I couldn't sleep,

01:30:58.192 --> 01:31:01.361
so I got up and went to
your place to check on him

01:31:02.495 --> 01:31:03.427
and the door was open.

01:31:03.429 --> 01:31:06.632
The lock sticks.
He never locked it.

01:31:07.034 --> 01:31:08.335
And Anneke,

01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:12.072
she's no one now,
you know that?

01:31:13.773 --> 01:31:16.976
She doesn't know where that money
is and it's driving her mad.

01:31:18.744 --> 01:31:20.314
That's what
happened, Katherine.

01:31:26.285 --> 01:31:27.452
I'm sorry.

01:31:35.094 --> 01:31:37.329
This gun wasn't even loaded,
you know that, right?

01:31:46.071 --> 01:31:47.440
The woman in the photos?

01:31:50.342 --> 01:31:51.409
Who is she?

01:31:53.911 --> 01:31:55.512
I don't know
who she was.

01:31:57.449 --> 01:31:58.515
Or is.

01:31:59.583 --> 01:32:01.452
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:32:03.053 --> 01:32:04.455
I'm sorry.

01:32:06.991 --> 01:32:09.460
Yeah, me too.

01:33:02.842 --> 01:33:03.743
Hi.

01:33:05.312 --> 01:33:07.547
I'm sorry I haven't
visited until now.

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:10.484
It's okay.

01:33:13.453 --> 01:33:14.521
No, it's not.

01:33:24.997 --> 01:33:26.399
I heard you went
to the police.

01:33:28.834 --> 01:33:30.901
And of course,
you saw Emile.

01:33:30.903 --> 01:33:32.571
I'm sorry, Anneke,
I thought...

01:33:40.913 --> 01:33:42.314
I don't know
what I thought, I...

01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:46.285
I thought it would make
me feel better.

01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:53.789
I just...
I want you to know

01:33:53.791 --> 01:33:57.193
I never meant for anything
to get so out of control.

01:33:57.195 --> 01:33:59.962
But when you started
talking about moving,

01:33:59.964 --> 01:34:01.566
about leaving me here, I...

01:34:03.733 --> 01:34:04.868
Stefan was my whole life.

01:34:05.836 --> 01:34:07.271
What are you saying?

01:34:08.973 --> 01:34:10.274
I leaked those photos,

01:34:12.708 --> 01:34:13.810
so you would see them.

01:34:14.978 --> 01:34:16.246
So you would leave him.

01:34:17.447 --> 01:34:19.850
I hired Christoff,
the photographer

01:34:20.283 --> 01:34:21.818
to follow him.

01:34:23.019 --> 01:34:24.818
To find something.

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.288
How should I've known
he would go so crazy.

01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:30.159
I mean, you broke
the poor man's nose.

01:34:32.628 --> 01:34:34.295
When he found out

01:34:34.297 --> 01:34:36.166
I was the one behind it,
well...

01:34:36.831 --> 01:34:38.633
He turned on me.

01:34:40.136 --> 01:34:42.436
He wrote me out
of all the accounts.

01:34:42.438 --> 01:34:44.670
He vowed never
to speak to me.

01:34:46.641 --> 01:34:48.841
Anneke, I think
you should go.

01:34:48.843 --> 01:34:50.278
That woman
was his therapist

01:34:51.179 --> 01:34:52.546
and had been for years.

01:34:52.548 --> 01:34:55.281
It was nothing between
them other than that.

01:34:55.283 --> 01:34:56.883
What are you talking about?

01:34:56.885 --> 01:34:58.219
The woman in the photos.

01:34:58.987 --> 01:35:00.687
It was no affair at all.

01:35:01.822 --> 01:35:03.189
He loved you.

01:35:05.792 --> 01:35:08.060
But, that money,

01:35:08.062 --> 01:35:09.430
I really do need it.

01:35:14.401 --> 01:35:15.969
Excuse me,
there's something going on.

01:35:18.805 --> 01:35:20.705
Whatever happened,
it's done.

01:35:20.707 --> 01:35:22.676
You want the money,
you can have the money.

01:35:23.277 --> 01:35:24.677
Just get out.

01:35:34.288 --> 01:35:37.421
Room 403.

01:35:37.423 --> 01:35:40.723
Hello, my mother.
In Room 403.

01:35:40.725 --> 01:35:43.060
Elaine Grant.
Something's going on.

01:35:58.611 --> 01:36:00.844
Mom, you're okay?

01:36:02.713 --> 01:36:03.948
I'm here.

01:36:11.089 --> 01:36:12.489
Mom.

01:36:17.027 --> 01:36:18.429
I love you.

01:36:39.948 --> 01:36:42.116
Oh, God.

01:37:31.798 --> 01:37:33.031
I'm sorry.

01:37:33.033 --> 01:37:34.667
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:36.636
<i>I should have been there.
I should have come.</i>

01:37:38.037 --> 01:37:40.607
<i>At least she wasn't alone.</i>

01:37:41.374 --> 01:37:43.274
Yeah. Hmm.

01:37:43.276 --> 01:37:46.110
<i>So what do
we even do?</i>

01:37:46.112 --> 01:37:47.714
I'm figuring
all that out now.

01:37:48.914 --> 01:37:50.782
<i>Okay.</i>

01:37:50.784 --> 01:37:52.584
<i>Well, you let me know
if you need anything.</i>

01:37:53.452 --> 01:37:54.953
Yes, of course.

01:37:56.255 --> 01:37:57.590
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:59.793
<i>Thank you for being there.</i>

01:38:01.694 --> 01:38:02.894
<i>I love you.</i>

01:38:04.095 --> 01:38:05.431
I love you too.

01:38:29.654 --> 01:38:31.121
They said I should
call someone.

01:38:33.323 --> 01:38:34.625
I'm glad you did.

01:38:37.427 --> 01:38:39.696
I'm very sorry
for you loss.

01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:44.835
Have you thought about how
you would like to proceed?

01:38:57.313 --> 01:38:59.081
I want to go outside.

01:39:46.794 --> 01:39:48.127
You okay?

01:39:52.298 --> 01:39:54.767
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:40:10.248 --> 01:40:11.818
Thank you.
