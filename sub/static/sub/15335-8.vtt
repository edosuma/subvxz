35:50.048 --> 35:51.116
PERHAPS.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.117
THERE'S NO PERHAPS
ABOUT IT.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.887
WOULD YOU DO ANYTHING
DIFFERENTLY NOW?

36:00.326 --> 36:01.026
NO.

36:01.059 --> 36:02.160
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

36:02.194 --> 36:04.162
IF THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU STILL CARE ABOUT,

36:04.196 --> 36:05.997
GO BACK AND FIGHT.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.500
FIGHT TO BE REINSTATED.

36:08.534 --> 36:09.501
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

36:09.535 --> 36:12.804
I'VE BEEN SCREWED OVER,
AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.306
DO I?

36:14.340 --> 36:17.643
I LEFT SERGEANT PRUITT
TO FINISH MY TASK AND...

36:17.676 --> 36:18.977
AND TO GO FOR HELP.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.078
WOULD I HAVE LET HIM DIE

36:20.111 --> 36:21.380
HAD A REAL MISSION
BEEN ON THE LINE?

36:21.413 --> 36:22.281
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I WOULD HAVE

36:22.314 --> 36:23.715
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
I WAS TRAINED TO DO,

36:23.749 --> 36:25.083
BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES
WERE DIFFERENT.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.253
I LEFT PRUITT
TO AID HIM.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.053
SO WHAT?

36:28.086 --> 36:30.188
YOU WANT A MEDAL
FOR GOOD INTENTIONS?

36:30.222 --> 36:32.991
I WANT YOU TO SPEAK
WITH COLONEL RYAN

36:33.024 --> 36:35.026
TO REINSTATE ME
BACK INTO SELECTION.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.262
HATE TO BREAK IT
TO YOU, SON,

36:36.295 --> 36:37.162
BUT SELECTION IS OVER.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.231
THEN I THINK SOMEONE
OWES ME AN APOLOGY.

36:39.265 --> 36:42.000
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
IN THE ARMY, BOY?

36:42.033 --> 36:45.871
HEY, MACK, SERGEANT BROWN
HERE WANTS AN APOLOGY

36:45.904 --> 36:47.005
FOR BEING MISTREATED.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.242
OK. SORRY
YOU WERE MISTREATED.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.176
YOU FEEL BETTER NOW?

36:51.209 --> 36:53.011
THIS AIN'T
NO BOOK CLUB, BROWN.

36:53.044 --> 36:56.181
IF YOU WANT TO BE
CODDLED AND PETTED,

36:56.214 --> 36:58.350
YOU BETTER GO HOME
AND SEE YOUR WIFE.

36:58.384 --> 36:59.685
HOW DID HE DIE?

36:59.718 --> 37:00.686
WHO?
PRUITT.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.720
OH, YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW PRUITT DIED.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.856
INFECTION?
KIDNEY FAILURE?
HEART ATTACK?

37:04.890 --> 37:07.959
BECAUSE WHEN I LEFT HIM,
HE HAD A BROKEN LEG,

37:07.993 --> 37:09.060
MAYBE.

37:09.094 --> 37:10.962
HOW DID HE DIE?

37:10.996 --> 37:14.099
HE DIDN'T DIE.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.066
WHAT?

37:15.100 --> 37:17.536
HE WAS DISCHARGED
FROM THE HOSPITAL YESTERDAY.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.571
HE'S BACK
AT FORT BENNING NOW.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.707
YOU LIED TO ME?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.141
WELL, YEAH.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.943
YOU LET ME FEEL
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.646
HOW ABOUT THAT?
DOES THAT MAKE YOU SAD?

37:27.679 --> 37:29.548
OUR JOB
IS TO MAKE YOU FAIL.

37:29.581 --> 37:33.619

ARE FIT TO BE IN THE UNIT.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.887

I CAN OUTSMART?

37:37.088 --> 37:41.660
SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA FOLD
WHEN THINGS GET
A LITTLE DICEY?

37:42.160 --> 37:43.161
HOW MANY GOT IN?

37:43.194 --> 37:47.165
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
ANY OF YOUR CONCERN.

37:50.135 --> 37:52.103

37:53.171 --> 37:54.440
CAN YOU TELL ME WHO?

37:54.473 --> 37:56.007
YOU GOT THAT LIST

37:56.041 --> 37:59.010

SUPPOSED TO NOTIFY?

38:01.547 --> 38:02.247

38:02.280 --> 38:04.082
GRUNEGER? I RAN LAPS
AROUND HIM.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.951
HE LISTENED TO COLONEL RYAN.
YOU DIDN'T.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.185
COLONEL RYAN? WHAT--

38:07.218 --> 38:10.055
WHAT DID COLONEL RYAN SAY?

38:14.025 --> 38:17.095
"WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
BECAUSE OF YOUR MINDSET

38:17.128 --> 38:19.531
YOU WERE OUT OF SELE--"

38:21.166 --> 38:24.169
IT WAS A QUESTION.

38:26.171 --> 38:28.006
IT WAS A QUESTION,
NOT A STATEMENT.

38:28.039 --> 38:28.974

WHAT YOU DID?

38:35.080 --> 38:38.517

MY WITHDRAWAL.

38:38.550 --> 38:43.154
NO ONE SAID
IT WAS ACCEPTED, AND...

38:43.188 --> 38:44.656
AND I COMPLETED
THE COURSE, SO...

38:44.690 --> 38:46.157
I'M LISTENING.

38:46.191 --> 38:49.027

A SPECIAL AWARD.

41:37.095 --> 41:38.163
