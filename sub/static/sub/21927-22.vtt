00:01.251 --> 00:02.662
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:02.878 --> 00:05.621
You know that Mr. Rosenbloom
with the furniture store

00:05.839 --> 00:07.046
over by the steak house?

00:07.341 --> 00:08.673
He's asked me to dinner.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.250
Is he your boyfriend?

00:10.469 --> 00:12.677
Well, he's one of them,
so let's not bring that up.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.095
All right, so what can I do
for you?

00:14.306 --> 00:15.842
What's it like
to be Jewish?

00:16.058 --> 00:17.970
Oh, it's terrible.
I don't recommend it.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.177
Yeah?

00:20.395 --> 00:23.559
Connie, I would like
to have dinner with you tonight.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.310
This is very promising.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.058
<i>Dr. Sturgis and Meemaw</i>

00:27.277 --> 00:28.438
had their first
sleepover.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.646
It's a big step
in their relationship.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.821
I'm going to go
congratulate them.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.442
Hey, put on a jacket,
it's chilly out.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.829
I have only seen you eat
vanilla ice cream for dessert.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.502
- Why is that?
- Well, I've taken a page

00:46.713 --> 00:48.830
from the great physicist
Richard Feynman.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.460
In order to have

00:50.676 --> 00:52.292
one less decision
in his life,

00:52.511 --> 00:56.630
he decided that dessert would
always be chocolate ice cream.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.680
Sounds like it could
get kind of boring.

00:58.892 --> 00:59.882
Oh, it does.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.140
But over the
last 35 years,

01:03.355 --> 01:07.269
I believe I've saved
at least a day and a half.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.481
Well, you have to let me
cook for you sometime.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.532
But I enjoy cooking for you.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.030
It's a means of
expressing my affection.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.698
It also allows me to control
the amount of garlic,

01:22.916 --> 01:24.373
which gives me the burps.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.334
Well, I do make
a mean barbecue,

01:27.546 --> 01:30.129
and I promise I can
make it garlic-free.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.706
Excellent!

01:31.925 --> 01:35.464
Next time, you can express
your affection for me.

01:37.306 --> 01:39.298
Excuse me.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.428
I bet it's Sheldon
checking on us.

01:42.811 --> 01:43.426
What?

01:43.645 --> 01:45.352
Connie? It's Ira.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.390
Hey... Hey...

01:48.650 --> 01:49.561
I'm, uh...

01:49.901 --> 01:52.109
I-It's Sheldon.
He... sounds a little agitated.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.482
I'm gonna take it
in the other room.

01:53.697 --> 01:54.687
Just...

02:00.203 --> 02:01.364
Hello again.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.287
Listen, I'm wondering what
you're doing this weekend.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.488
I miss you.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.582
Cool, cool.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.041
You want to go to a movie

02:08.252 --> 02:09.960
or bowl a few frames?

02:10.922 --> 02:14.040
Uh, you know, listen,
it's not a great time right now.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.545
Um, I have a little family over,

02:15.761 --> 02:17.548
and can I call you later?

02:17.763 --> 02:20.221
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
I-I don't want to interrupt.

02:20.432 --> 02:22.389
I just miss hearing your voice.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.885
Well... here it is,

02:25.103 --> 02:26.389
coming right up
out of my throat.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.228
Um, okay,

02:28.440 --> 02:30.306
so, uh, uh, bye.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.686
Bye-bye.

02:33.945 --> 02:34.935
How's Sheldon doing?

02:35.697 --> 02:36.778
- What?
- Sheldon.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.447
You were talking to Sheldon.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.948
Oh... right, yes.

02:42.371 --> 02:45.239
Did you know he has a picture
of that fella Feynman

02:45.457 --> 02:46.493
in his bedroom?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.370
What? So do I.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.666
Peas in a pod.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.335
Oh, darn.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.628
Excuse me.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.002
Yes?

02:56.218 --> 02:57.004
How's it going?

02:57.219 --> 02:58.505
It's Sheldon again.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.756
What do you mean "again"?

02:59.971 --> 03:00.882
Speak.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.555
I recently read an article

03:02.766 --> 03:04.382
about a superconducting
supercollider

03:04.601 --> 03:05.967
that might be built in Texas.

03:06.895 --> 03:07.931
What about it?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.057
Well, I thought
if there was a lull

03:09.272 --> 03:10.558
in your dinner conversation,

03:10.774 --> 03:12.857
you might casually drop it
as an icebreaker.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.651
Our dinner conversation
is going just fine.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.444
Well, now you have it
in your back pocket.

03:17.656 --> 03:18.863
Carry on.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.448
Question... will we be engaging
in coitus tonight?

03:28.667 --> 03:31.956
Because I believe
I pulled a hamstring

03:32.170 --> 03:33.627
on the bike ride over.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.337
Why didn't you
say something?

03:35.549 --> 03:38.132
Well, I was trying
to display machismo,

03:38.593 --> 03:40.630
but it's becoming
more and more clear

03:40.846 --> 03:42.963
that there's something
askew in my groin.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.388
Oh, John...

03:45.350 --> 03:47.137
we don't have
to do anything.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.347
We can just be together.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.804
Thanks.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.479
But if it's all
the same to you,

03:52.691 --> 03:54.853
I'd like to give it
the old college try.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.336
Here you go.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.084
Thank you.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.962
So, you're really
gonna go out

04:21.178 --> 04:22.339
with this furniture
store fella

04:22.554 --> 04:23.840
while seeing Dr. Sturgis?

04:24.055 --> 04:26.172
It's called playing the field.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.637
And if you'd done
some of that,

04:28.852 --> 04:30.969
you wouldn't be saddled
with Bluto in there.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.349
That's not nice.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.396
And is that
really necessary?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.066
The Italians call it
"corretto."

04:37.277 --> 04:39.519
It means correcting
the drink.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.814
So, a drink without
alcohol in it is wrong?

04:43.825 --> 04:44.440
Yep.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.117
Italian people, they know what's up.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.282
All right, one issue
at a time.

04:49.915 --> 04:53.955
So, you're really gonna date
two men simultaneously?

04:54.169 --> 04:56.536
- Two that you know of.
- Oh, Mom.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.542
Come on, don't be
such a prude.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.089
I'm not gonna have
any babies.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.916
I don't need these men
to take care of me.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.377
Why shouldn't I just
enjoy myself?

05:04.596 --> 05:06.713
Well, it isn't very
Christian of you.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.844
I got no argument there.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.600
Salute!

05:13.188 --> 05:14.349
Yeah, that fixed it.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.355
Mmm.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.951
Oh, Meemaw, no.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.579
Hey, who are you calling?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.078
Dr. Sturgis.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.248
Why?

05:39.464 --> 05:40.955
I saw Meemaw get in a car

05:41.174 --> 05:42.915
with Mr. Rosenbloom.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.586
No...

05:49.057 --> 05:50.923
<i>I don't know
if it really happened this way,</i>

05:51.142 --> 05:52.804
<i>but to my nine-year-old mind,</i>

05:53.019 --> 05:54.806
<i>my mother was flying.</i>

06:03.405 --> 06:05.738
So, how's the brisket?

06:05.949 --> 06:07.156
It's good.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.110
It ain't my brisket,
but it's good.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.489
I should take you
to New York

06:11.705 --> 06:13.867
so you could taste some
authentic Jewish brisket.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.243
How's it different?

06:15.458 --> 06:16.744
Well, it's pretty much
the same except

06:16.960 --> 06:19.168
it's-it's a lot juicier
and you can feel the fat

06:19.379 --> 06:20.540
go directly to your heart.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.165
Oh, boy...

06:24.384 --> 06:25.920
I miss that laugh.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.048
So, uh...

06:29.431 --> 06:30.888
what do you think
of that idea?

06:31.516 --> 06:33.758
- What idea?
- Going to New York.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.093
Maybe we'll catch
a couple of Broadway shows,

06:36.313 --> 06:37.554
uh, see some sights.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.061
Oh, Ira, gee...

06:42.694 --> 06:43.730
I don't know.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.483
- Seems like a big step.
- Is it?

06:46.698 --> 06:48.109
I think at this time
of our lives,

06:48.325 --> 06:50.237
we should travel,
see the world.

06:50.827 --> 06:51.943
- I guess.
- I mean,

06:52.162 --> 06:53.403
we're not getting
any younger.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.529
What's that supposed to mean?

06:57.334 --> 06:59.326
I mean, I mean, <i>I'm</i> not
getting any younger.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.785
You, on the other hand,

07:01.004 --> 07:03.371
you are a blossoming tulip.

07:03.965 --> 07:04.876
Better.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.129
<i>But I still don't understand.</i>

07:08.678 --> 07:10.510
Your grandmother's
a single lady.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.463
She's not committed
to any one fella,

07:12.682 --> 07:14.469
and she wants to see
what her options are.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.767
But Dr. Sturgis is
the best option.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.560
Well, you might
feel that way,

07:18.772 --> 07:19.979
but she's not so sure.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.977
Then we need to tell her.
I'll make the call.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.525
No. We need to
mind our business

07:24.736 --> 07:26.978
and maybe pray for her
to make the right decision.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.773
We're gonna leave this
up to God?

07:30.325 --> 07:32.362
You think you could do
a better job than God?

07:32.577 --> 07:34.159
Maybe not with
creating the universe,

07:34.371 --> 07:35.532
but I bet
I could free the Hebrews

07:35.747 --> 07:37.158
with one good plague.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.160
<i>You can get lox, bagels,</i>

07:39.542 --> 07:42.080
all the trimmings
at 3:30 in the morning.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.582
Why would I want that?

07:45.256 --> 07:47.293
Well, you wouldn't.
I mean, it's too heavy.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.465
But you could
if you wanted.

07:49.844 --> 07:50.800
So, what do you think?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.383
Oh, Ira, I don't think so.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.214
All right, what do you say

07:55.433 --> 07:57.174
to a weekend
in New Orleans, huh?

07:57.435 --> 07:59.017
We could do one of those
Carnival Cruise things.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.596
You're killing me.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.181
I can't do this, I...

08:03.692 --> 08:04.853
Can't do what?

08:06.152 --> 08:08.235
Ira, you're just
a wonderful man.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.859
Oh, boy, I don't like
where this is going.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.656
But to tell you the truth,

08:13.118 --> 08:14.359
I'm seeing somebody else.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.909
And we've gone there.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.205
I thought I could do it, uh...
you know, date both of you,

08:19.416 --> 08:21.749
but I-I can't, I can't,
I just...

08:21.960 --> 08:23.701
I'm not cut out for it.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.912
Okay, suggestion.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.963
And maybe you've already
thought of this...

08:28.425 --> 08:29.836
but what do you say
you break up with him

08:30.051 --> 08:31.212
and only see me?

08:37.392 --> 08:38.633
I'm sorry.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.851
I thought I could
handle this.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.178
- It's okay.
- You know,

08:42.397 --> 08:45.640
you get older, and you think
your skin is thicker...

08:45.859 --> 08:47.691
- It's okay.
- ...and your heart is tougher.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.402
But it's not, it's
the other way around.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.737
I hope this guy knows
what a gift he has in you.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.408
Well, "gift" is a strong word,

08:56.619 --> 08:58.656
but he's enthusiastic.

08:58.872 --> 08:59.908
Good.

09:00.123 --> 09:03.241
May you both be
very happy together!

09:07.297 --> 09:08.708
I don't want to
celebrate too soon,

09:09.049 --> 09:12.133
but Meemaw and Mr. Rosenbloom
are back, and he was crying.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.097
There'll be more updates
as they happen.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.515
I'm done.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.941
Can I please be excused?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.896
Good Lord, did you
even chew it?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.569
Not the recommended amount, no.

09:32.781 --> 09:33.692
What's your hurry?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.899
I need to get back
to my viewing post.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.200
Fine, go ahead.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.697
What's he expect to see,
staring at Meemaw's house?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.748
Did you just join this family?

09:44.959 --> 09:46.245
The kid's an oddball.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.372
He's just excited
that Meemaw's dating

09:48.588 --> 09:50.079
a man he looks up to.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.585
I wish she could date
Tony Danza... that'd be cool.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.875
What is it with you
and Tony Danza?

09:55.261 --> 09:57.378
Well, the show doesn't
come out and say it,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.589
but I'm pretty sure
he's the boss.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.596
I think the blonde
lady's the boss.

10:02.811 --> 10:03.597
Angela?

10:03.812 --> 10:05.394
Who's the oddball now?

10:08.566 --> 10:09.807
I'm warning you,

10:10.193 --> 10:11.809
once you try my barbecue,

10:12.278 --> 10:15.021
it will ruin you
to all the others.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.906
That's what happened to me
with quilted toilet paper.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.030
Once I tried the good stuff,

10:20.245 --> 10:22.453
everything else felt
like a Brillo pad.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.115
You paint quite the picture,
don't you?

10:27.210 --> 10:28.326
Oh, gosh.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.501
Excuse me.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.418
Sheldon,
this is not cute anymore.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.877
- Connie Tucker?
- Yes?

10:38.096 --> 10:39.428
I have a dinette set
from Rosenbloom's Furniture.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.425
Oh.

10:40.849 --> 10:41.965
I didn't buy any furniture.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.015
I think it's a gift.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.511
Oh, boy.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.265
I bent down to pick up a book,

10:48.481 --> 10:51.645
and I'll be darned if she didn't
sneak a look at my derriere.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.817
Oh, man.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.526
You won't believe what's
happening at Meemaw's house.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.948
Is it more interesting
than <i>Who's the Boss?</i>

11:00.160 --> 11:01.196
Doubt it.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.155
Rosenbloom's Fine Furniture.
Ira speaking.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.165
Why are you sending me
furniture?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.164
I've decided
I can't go away quietly.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.204
I'm fighting for your love.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.005
With a dinette set?

11:15.216 --> 11:17.629
Oh, this isn't just any dinette
set. It's our biggest seller.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.210
And it's not pressed wood...

11:19.804 --> 11:20.840
it's oak!

11:21.055 --> 11:23.342
Ira, I don't like this.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.053
Would you prefer
a leather sectional?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.852
Uh, what's going on?

11:30.106 --> 11:30.766
Uh,

11:30.982 --> 11:32.063
can I call you back?

11:32.483 --> 11:33.690
I look forward to it.

11:33.902 --> 11:34.688
You shouldn't.

11:38.948 --> 11:39.813
Okay.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.490
I guess
you could say

11:41.910 --> 11:42.991
one of my former boyfriends

11:43.203 --> 11:45.570
is trying to win me back
with furniture.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.618
Huh. Impressive.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.415
This is real oak.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.584
Was that him
on the phone?

11:52.795 --> 11:54.411
Yes. I'm sorry.

11:56.466 --> 11:57.627
Interesting.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.132
What?

11:59.344 --> 12:01.586
Being challenged by another man

12:02.263 --> 12:05.097
is making you more
attractive to me.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.265
I don't follow.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.309
I'll have to do
some research,

12:09.562 --> 12:13.226
but I'm guessing
this is a genetic instinct

12:13.441 --> 12:16.275
that's raising my libido.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.770
I need a drink.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.698
Can you believe he tried to win
me back with a dinette set?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.779
I'd give you a dinette set
if you'd leave Texas.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.873
So, would you return it?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.667
Hell no, I'm keeping it.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.244
But then you'll be
beholden to him.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.330
Would you ever take Ira back?

12:38.549 --> 12:39.289
I don't know.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.216
He's sweet as he can be, but...

12:43.388 --> 12:45.425
there's just something
about John.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.306
He's like a cute
little teddy bear, you know?

12:48.559 --> 12:49.640
A brilliant,

12:49.852 --> 12:50.968
bicycle-riding

12:51.229 --> 12:52.140
teddy bear.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.555
I don't even understand half
of what he says.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.605
But...

12:57.360 --> 12:59.602
when he's not around,
I just miss him.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.947
Sounds like you're
falling in love.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.320
Maybe I am.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.157
Excellent.
I love him, too.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.362
Get out of here!

13:10.581 --> 13:12.573
If you don't understand
what Dr. Sturgis says,

13:12.834 --> 13:13.790
I'm happy
to explain it to you.

13:14.002 --> 13:14.833
Get!

13:19.465 --> 13:20.376
Excuse me.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.633
I'm looking for Ira.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.839
At your service.
What can I do for you?

13:25.388 --> 13:28.256
You, sir,
have overstepped your bounds.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.882
I'm sorry, what?

13:30.101 --> 13:31.433
Miss Constance Tucker

13:31.644 --> 13:34.933
made it clear your courtship
was no longer welcome,

13:35.189 --> 13:37.772
and you responded
with six chairs,

13:38.026 --> 13:40.518
a table, and an expansion leaf.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.652
Who are you?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.021
John Sturgis,

13:44.324 --> 13:45.940
the man she chose

13:46.159 --> 13:47.991
and your romantic rival.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.694
I-I'm sorry, wait, what-what
is it you want from me?

13:50.872 --> 13:53.364
I want you to give up
your pursuit of Connie.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.916
All right, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave my store.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.501
Very well.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.290
The line in the sand
has been drawn.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.216
Cross it at your own peril.

14:10.767 --> 14:11.848
Weirdo.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.059
What was that?

14:22.278 --> 14:23.314
You heard me.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.818
Sir, I am a man with feelings.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.734
And you have hurt them.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.245
I know you've had
a number of...

14:35.458 --> 14:36.744
gentleman callers,

14:36.959 --> 14:39.326
but I've never heard you
speak like this before.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.626
"Gentleman callers"?

14:40.838 --> 14:42.420
And we wonder where
Sheldon gets it.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.257
I'm sorry y'all find this funny,

14:45.468 --> 14:46.754
but this is the first time

14:46.969 --> 14:49.052
my mother's expressed
real interest in a man

14:49.263 --> 14:50.504
since Dad died.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.430
Forgive me for
wanting to know more.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.263
You really want to know more?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.684
Imagine you're getting on
in years,

15:00.149 --> 15:02.015
you and your husband
about to retire,

15:02.235 --> 15:04.022
get a little timeshare
in Sarasota,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.479
and... suddenly...

15:07.115 --> 15:08.322
he's gone,

15:09.325 --> 15:10.782
and you're all alone.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.284
You mourn, you cry,

15:14.539 --> 15:16.531
but eventually you move on.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.707
You start dating a little,

15:20.044 --> 15:21.455
and it's all good fun.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.291
But always in the back
of your mind,

15:24.507 --> 15:25.918
there's that question...

15:28.678 --> 15:30.715
"Will I be alone in the end?"

15:38.396 --> 15:39.603
Why y'all looking at me for?

15:42.400 --> 15:44.062
Haven't slept in days.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.893
It's like I'm
a lovesick teenager,

15:46.112 --> 15:49.230
except I remember the Truman administration.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.736
Your feelings
are understandable.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.700
Connie is
a remarkable woman.

15:53.911 --> 15:54.867
Yes, she is.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.746
But, again, I'm sorry. I should
never have called you weird.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.823
I mean, eh, it was rude.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.417
I've been called
much worse.

16:02.628 --> 16:06.747
A professor once called me
ostrobogulous.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.332
I had to look that one up.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.632
What's it mean?

16:09.886 --> 16:10.922
That I'm a weirdo.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.633
John, you're a great guy.

16:14.891 --> 16:15.927
Well, you, too!

16:16.142 --> 16:17.974
But I hope you
understand, I just...

16:18.227 --> 16:19.388
I can't give up on Connie.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.687
That's all right.
To tell you the truth,

16:21.898 --> 16:26.108
I'm finding the competition
quite exhilarating.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.191
You are?

16:27.403 --> 16:28.189
Oh, yes.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.941
The night
the dinette set arrived,

16:31.157 --> 16:34.616
I did my first push-up
in 40 years.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.786
I'm sorry, but I find
that to be, uh...

16:38.998 --> 16:41.115
what's the word...
astro-boobulous?

16:41.334 --> 16:42.791
Ostrobogulous.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.584
Ostrobogulous.

16:44.837 --> 16:45.918
Exactly.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.290
Now, give me your best price

16:49.509 --> 16:50.841
on one of these

16:51.052 --> 16:53.465
with a cup holder.

17:00.228 --> 17:03.221
John! What
a pleasant surprise.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.601
- I have some news for you.
- Oh?

17:05.983 --> 17:07.645
- Mwah. What is that?
- Mwah.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.603
I went to the furniture
store and spoke to Ira.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.776
- Why would you do that?
- To demand

17:13.991 --> 17:16.825
that he respect your
wish to be left alone.

17:17.078 --> 17:21.367
John, it was not
your place to do that.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.741
Well, if it helps,

17:23.960 --> 17:26.077
he doesn't plan on
leaving you alone.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.673
What the hell
were you thinking?!

17:35.763 --> 17:37.220
That I was being chivalrous.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.297
By going behind my back?

17:39.809 --> 17:41.596
You seem upset.

17:41.811 --> 17:42.801
I am upset!

17:43.020 --> 17:46.058
And how I handle Ira
is my business!

17:47.024 --> 17:48.435
Well, I hope you do it gently.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.438
He's very vulnerable these days.

17:50.653 --> 17:51.894
You're friends now?

17:52.113 --> 17:53.570
Well, I wouldn't say friends,

17:53.781 --> 17:55.647
but I could see, over time,

17:55.866 --> 17:56.777
you know,
we might...

17:56.993 --> 17:58.029
Are you two fighting?

17:59.870 --> 18:00.826
No.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.154
Oh, good.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.456
I was almost certain
that we were.

18:04.709 --> 18:05.495
We are.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.121
- I'm confused.
- Me, too.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.168
Is this because you went
to the furniture store?

18:09.380 --> 18:10.496
He knows about this?

18:10.715 --> 18:12.251
- Yes.
- Yes. - All right, now, listen,

18:12.466 --> 18:14.332
if this relationship's
gonna have any chance at all,

18:14.594 --> 18:16.005
we have to lay down
some ground rules.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.423
Great. I love rules.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.966
I do, too.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.014
I don't want you talking to him
about anything

18:21.267 --> 18:22.383
having to do
with anything about us.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.433
Same with you.

18:23.644 --> 18:24.725
And I want you
to stop

18:24.937 --> 18:26.644
spying on me
with those binoculars

18:26.856 --> 18:28.848
like you're on some kind
of African safari.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.602
And you cannot talk

18:30.818 --> 18:34.107
to Ira or any of my
ex-boyfriends, for that matter.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.987
This list is getting long.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.780
Maybe we should write it down.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.191
Hey.

18:40.578 --> 18:41.694
<i>In that moment,</i>

18:41.912 --> 18:43.699
<i>I had an epiphany.</i>

18:43.914 --> 18:47.999
<i>I could draw up a contract
for any social relationship.</i>

18:50.171 --> 18:52.584
<i>It was a helpful way
to remove ambiguity</i>

18:52.798 --> 18:55.165
<i>in a world that was often hard
to understand.</i>

18:55.384 --> 18:56.795
Article three...

18:57.011 --> 18:59.048
Sheldon will not spy

18:59.263 --> 19:02.381
on Meemaw's house
with binoculars.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.966
Type that one in bold.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.727
Please sign and date.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.981
You know, Sheldon,
I'm a notary, if that helps.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.157
Just when I thought
you couldn't get cooler.

19:22.745 --> 19:23.485
<i>I would go on</i>

19:23.704 --> 19:26.162
<i>to draw up such contracts
throughout my life...</i>

19:26.582 --> 19:27.823
<i>with roommates,</i>

19:28.250 --> 19:29.616
<i>with my wife.</i>

19:31.962 --> 19:33.703
<i>Even with my own children.</i>
