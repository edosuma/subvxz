00:02.314 --> 00:05.337
- We should go for a drink.
- I didn't mean this to happen.

00:05.376 --> 00:08.570
- It is you, isn't it?
- I don't know who took this.

00:08.570 --> 00:12.330
I think someone's following me.
He's taking weird photos.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.050
That's here.

00:14.050 --> 00:16.010
This creep's got you.

00:16.010 --> 00:20.010
Can I trust you?
It's pure, Cassie.

00:52.362 --> 00:53.792
Dad?

01:01.728 --> 01:03.009
Dad?

01:13.391 --> 01:15.309
Something...

01:28.146 --> 01:31.358
I'll get you! I'll get you!

01:34.090 --> 01:36.570
Think you can get away from me,
do you?

01:40.210 --> 01:42.494
Argh!

01:42.712 --> 01:44.028
Dad!

01:45.144 --> 01:46.363
Hey!

01:47.674 --> 01:49.690
Hey-hey-hey!

01:49.690 --> 01:51.446
Oh, brilliant.

01:52.383 --> 01:53.490
You're here!

01:53.490 --> 01:55.530
Oh-oh!

01:55.941 --> 01:57.930
Dad, what's this?

01:59.194 --> 02:00.617
The Alamo!

02:01.050 --> 02:02.370
Ohh.

02:02.447 --> 02:03.607
Oh, man.

02:16.187 --> 02:17.132
Oh, dear.

02:26.090 --> 02:28.170
We've been busy,
haven't we, Rueben?

02:28.170 --> 02:30.560
We're always busy.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.770
Yes, so much to do.

02:34.743 --> 02:35.894
Oh, shit.

02:35.979 --> 02:38.130
- I can do that.
- No, no, no, no.

02:38.130 --> 02:39.506
All set.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.039
Are you renovating?

02:43.485 --> 02:44.121
Huh?

02:44.151 --> 02:47.551
Oh, you, um, said you were busy.
Are you doing the place up?

02:48.097 --> 02:49.140
No.

02:49.999 --> 02:50.988
Anyway...

02:51.332 --> 02:52.313
Dad...

02:53.575 --> 02:54.400
Yes?

02:55.205 --> 02:57.435
Jakob's been taking some pictures
of me.

02:58.325 --> 02:59.059
Right.

02:59.832 --> 03:01.515
What kind of pictures?

03:01.542 --> 03:03.168
Um...

03:06.130 --> 03:09.120
Oh, um, I don't think
I can eat these.

03:10.537 --> 03:12.810
It's the, um... the Jewish thing.

03:13.646 --> 03:14.434
Oh.

03:14.805 --> 03:16.653
Did they cut your willy off?

03:17.294 --> 03:20.847
Oh, no.
Just a tiny, little bit.

03:21.466 --> 03:23.588
I'm not Jewish, am I, Dad?

03:23.970 --> 03:25.850
No. You're six!

03:26.771 --> 03:31.481
I want to stay for a couple of days.
Jakob's going to do me on the beach.

03:34.033 --> 03:35.580
Yes, of course. Of course.

03:47.970 --> 03:49.410
Oh...

03:49.410 --> 03:51.610
Dad, you don't have to give us
your bedroom.

03:51.610 --> 03:54.500
It's fine. I always sleep
in the kitchen, anyway.

03:54.865 --> 03:58.008
Right, because this isn't...
I mean... it's not like that.

03:58.163 --> 04:00.438
No. No problem.

04:03.881 --> 04:04.846
There.

04:05.357 --> 04:06.739
The sheets are, um...

04:07.153 --> 04:10.506
I don't sleep here.
No crustiness, et cetera.

04:11.239 --> 04:13.610
Right, make yourselves
comfortable.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.074
This is great.

04:16.672 --> 04:18.360
Everybody here.

04:28.262 --> 04:29.586
What just happened?

04:32.156 --> 04:34.025
Doesn't matter.

04:35.827 --> 04:37.770
Maybe I can clear some stuff.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.370
- I'll sleep on the chair.
- No, leave it.

04:41.221 --> 04:42.627
He doesn't like his stuff moved.

04:48.233 --> 04:49.001
Don't.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.261
Is this your mother?

05:10.909 --> 05:11.798
Yeah.

05:12.735 --> 05:13.970
My dad did it.

05:14.734 --> 05:16.020
Are there any more?

05:17.372 --> 05:18.683
No.

05:19.528 --> 05:23.650
- Why not? I mean, it's really...
- He burned them all after she died.

05:24.735 --> 05:25.650
Oh.

05:30.269 --> 05:31.989
Did he ever paint you?

05:32.450 --> 05:33.281
No.

05:34.548 --> 05:35.827
Only her.

You should have eaten
your sausages.

07:21.472 --> 07:23.300
I'm not good with raw pork.

07:23.830 --> 07:27.830
On cultural and food
hygiene levels.

07:29.228 --> 07:32.311
I like my salmonella
above body temperature.

07:34.006 --> 07:35.726
It's old-fashioned, I know.

07:36.460 --> 07:38.211
You're totally old-fashioned.

07:38.886 --> 07:40.847
I'm one of the chosen people.

07:41.315 --> 07:42.808
We've got routines.

07:43.082 --> 07:46.482
We like to make properly stupid
things seem important.

07:47.123 --> 07:49.613
It shows willing for God.

07:55.780 --> 07:57.857
Is he watching you, Jakob?

07:59.575 --> 08:01.085
Um... yeah.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.119
He likes setting tests.

08:07.473 --> 08:08.723
How are you doing?

08:09.950 --> 08:13.379
I'm a north London Yid, Cassie.
I can pass any test.

08:28.715 --> 08:30.723
Are you really a virgin?

08:31.575 --> 08:32.948
Yeah.

08:34.163 --> 08:35.215
Well...

08:36.270 --> 08:38.284
let's keep it that way.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.187
Chastity is my middle name.

08:45.357 --> 08:48.106
I mean, it actually is my middle
name.

08:52.247 --> 08:53.636
Come on!

08:56.741 --> 08:58.437
Run!

08:59.030 --> 09:01.142
I can free you.

09:02.661 --> 09:03.781
Fuck off!

09:03.816 --> 09:04.750
Is he always like this?

09:04.750 --> 09:07.830
Leave me alone!
Come on.

09:08.360 --> 09:09.883
Yeah. Nowadays.

09:12.830 --> 09:14.190
Come on!

09:14.190 --> 09:16.992
What was she like? Your mum?

09:18.970 --> 09:20.492
We didn't talk much.

09:23.444 --> 09:27.198
You... must have spoken to her
occasionally. I mean...

09:27.434 --> 09:28.704
she was your mum.

09:28.948 --> 09:29.710
No.

09:30.764 --> 09:32.708
We sent messages, mainly.

09:34.111 --> 09:35.518
Like...?

09:36.182 --> 09:40.399
Like... one summer, I tried
to starve myself to death.

09:44.022 --> 09:46.131
That's a little intense.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.110
- Go to sleep.
- Dad drank the vodka.

09:53.711 --> 09:54.852
I know.

10:00.990 --> 10:03.753
Oh, fuck off.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.124
Leave me alone!

10:11.698 --> 10:13.777
Go on!

10:26.542 --> 10:27.582
Ready?

10:28.136 --> 10:30.100
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

10:30.267 --> 10:31.782
Can I come?

10:32.770 --> 10:33.729
No.

10:35.681 --> 10:37.071
Let him come.

10:38.111 --> 10:40.429
- I'm a bit...
- He's supposed to be at school.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.306
Dad!

10:45.908 --> 10:46.847
Oh...

10:47.088 --> 10:49.364
- He's had a bit of a tum.
- No.

10:58.730 --> 10:59.810
What's that?

10:59.810 --> 11:01.410
- I don't know.
- They're from the school.

11:01.437 --> 11:02.970
He's supposed to go there.

11:02.970 --> 11:05.402
- Come on, Cassie.
- What the fuck...?

11:06.210 --> 11:08.251
What the fuck are you doing here?

11:08.665 --> 11:11.022
Stop being horrible.

11:18.535 --> 11:20.419
Nothing changes, does it, Dad?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.700
It's OK.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.435
Hi.

12:23.092 --> 12:24.106
Hi.

12:42.766 --> 12:44.204
Don't tell me off.

12:44.902 --> 12:47.090
I don't want to be
told off by the boyfriend.

12:47.644 --> 12:49.604
I'm not her boyfriend.

12:50.574 --> 12:51.842
Why not?

12:52.487 --> 12:53.946
Don't you like her?

12:55.055 --> 12:56.855
She doesn't want a boyfriend.

12:57.549 --> 12:58.299
Ever.

13:00.115 --> 13:01.334
Why not?

13:02.058 --> 13:04.004
I'm thinking, um...

13:05.090 --> 13:08.026
maybe you fucked her up.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.693
Probably not on... purpose.

13:21.661 --> 13:23.570
What do you do, then?

13:24.743 --> 13:26.444
I make pictures of her.

13:28.052 --> 13:29.082
Don't.

13:29.993 --> 13:31.346
I need her here.

13:32.740 --> 13:36.295
I need some help with the boy.

13:37.151 --> 13:39.925
And... maybe I can get something
going.

13:42.583 --> 13:44.468
You shouldn't put that on her.

13:47.370 --> 13:49.876
You're supposed to get your shit
together.

13:52.417 --> 13:53.694
Sorry.

14:37.582 --> 14:39.253
OK?

14:43.460 --> 14:44.692
Yeah.

14:47.890 --> 14:49.570
You have to go to school.

14:50.101 --> 14:52.996
- You have to make him take you, OK?
- OK.

14:53.705 --> 14:56.054
Jakob says he'll take my picture.

15:01.290 --> 15:02.330
OK.

15:02.454 --> 15:04.315
- Cool.
- Hey!

15:04.690 --> 15:06.134
You little booger!

16:04.426 --> 16:05.938
Hi!

16:07.310 --> 16:08.278
Oh.

16:08.820 --> 16:09.913
Um...

16:10.997 --> 16:12.277
Where did you go?

16:12.379 --> 16:15.659
To see my dad in Wales.
And my little brother.

16:15.774 --> 16:17.800
Ah. Cool.

16:17.831 --> 16:20.530
We're going to head out.
Some of the boys and me.

16:21.170 --> 16:22.013
Why?

16:23.013 --> 16:26.708
Well, cos I'm thinking it's mad
that we hardly know each other.

16:27.142 --> 16:29.209
We should... you know?

16:30.755 --> 16:32.376
I just got back.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.370
Well, what does that mean?

16:34.370 --> 16:36.031
Does that mean you're coming
or you're not coming?

16:36.039 --> 16:39.445
Cos otherwise, it's just me
and a bunch of snowboard wankers.

16:40.671 --> 16:42.960
And they're drunk!

18:25.805 --> 18:28.400
I'm here. I went out.

18:28.515 --> 18:30.595
- 'Nice time?'
- Yes.

18:31.220 --> 18:33.080
Somebody was using our pictures.

18:33.614 --> 18:34.771
In the club.

18:36.008 --> 18:36.921
Nice?

18:37.573 --> 18:39.659
Yeah. They looked...

18:40.614 --> 18:41.587
Yeah.

18:42.515 --> 18:44.067
Did you sell them?

18:45.333 --> 18:46.933
Why would I do that?

18:47.801 --> 18:49.217
Jakob?

18:51.408 --> 18:52.803
I love you.

18:54.725 --> 18:55.850
I love you, too.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.229
What do you think of my food?

20:21.730 --> 20:22.797
It's terrible.

20:26.131 --> 20:29.474
This place is going to shit
without a cook, you know?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.332
Where's Jakob?

20:33.330 --> 20:35.890
He needs to come back,
so Pete can stab him,

20:36.163 --> 20:37.471
give him his job back.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.736
I think maybe his
dick is very big.

20:43.619 --> 20:44.477
What?

20:44.658 --> 20:46.949
I think that's what he's got
that I haven't.

20:48.075 --> 20:49.974
Skinny guy, big dick.

20:51.711 --> 20:52.656
Yeah.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.414
You're not fucking him.

20:59.224 --> 21:00.305
Definitely.

21:00.832 --> 21:02.000
You're happy.

21:03.189 --> 21:04.521
What do you know?

21:08.880 --> 21:10.698
This girl, she came
for you before.

21:10.730 --> 21:12.490
I told her to come back.

21:12.630 --> 21:15.104
- Hi.
- Hi!

21:15.450 --> 21:18.918
- Can we sit?
- Um... yeah.

21:22.237 --> 21:24.677
This is Marcel Hulot.

21:24.817 --> 21:25.724
Hi.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.868
Happy to meet you.

21:29.215 --> 21:31.921
I guess... You never
heard of him?

21:34.870 --> 21:37.460
I've been seeing you in some
websites.

21:37.679 --> 21:41.763
A lot of people talk about this
girl and nobody knows her name.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.328
So we were looking for you.

21:46.566 --> 21:47.741
- Sorry?
- It's OK.

21:47.754 --> 21:49.304
You don't have to
pretend any more.

21:49.798 --> 21:51.478
It's Cassie, right?

21:51.579 --> 21:53.813
There is something
we want to ask you.

22:43.650 --> 22:45.026
63.

22:45.035 --> 22:47.848
And 29 with 41 and 3
for the first set-up.

22:47.970 --> 22:49.770
Second set-up here.

22:49.770 --> 22:53.770
Action shots 34, 13 and 22.

22:56.530 --> 22:58.977
Would you like to come
and take a seat?

23:26.001 --> 23:28.241
Welcome to my world.

23:51.069 --> 23:55.885
Cassie! We're going to get high.
Come!

24:11.676 --> 24:12.890
Hi.

24:12.890 --> 24:14.850
I know you, don't I?

24:14.850 --> 24:18.250
- Do you?

24:18.250 --> 24:19.490
I've got some coke.

24:19.490 --> 24:21.786
No, thanks.

24:22.867 --> 24:25.016
My dad's coming to pick me up.

24:25.032 --> 24:28.085
He's, you know, a bit of a thug.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.410
You know you want to.

24:35.005 --> 24:36.385
See you.

24:40.856 --> 24:41.741
Dad?

24:45.069 --> 24:47.229
- 'Cass?'
- Rueby?

24:47.300 --> 24:49.278
Are you OK?

24:49.512 --> 24:51.072
'I have to read my book.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.660
'Miss Esme says I
need to read it.'

24:53.660 --> 24:55.260
OK. What's it called?

24:55.260 --> 24:57.430
'Go, Dog, Go!'

24:59.220 --> 25:00.660
'"Dog.

25:00.660 --> 25:02.340
'"Big dog.

25:02.340 --> 25:04.660
'"Little dog.

25:04.660 --> 25:08.020
'"A big dog... going in.

25:08.020 --> 25:11.220
'"A little dog coming out.

25:11.220 --> 25:15.220
'"A red dog going up.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.220
'"A yellow dog coming down.

25:18.220 --> 25:21.380
'"Dogs in cars going away.

25:21.380 --> 25:24.020
'"The light is red.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.500
'"Stop, dogs, stop.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.340
'"Now it's green.

25:27.340 --> 25:31.340
' "Go, dogs. Go, dogs, go."

25:32.020 --> 25:33.540
'Am I good?'

25:34.258 --> 25:35.522
You're good, Rueben.

25:36.344 --> 25:37.762
You're the best.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.570

Hmm...

26:47.428 --> 26:48.793
- Jakob?
- Hmm?

26:55.260 --> 26:58.891
Do you have any idea how shit
these energy drinks are for you?

26:59.621 --> 27:00.625
No.

27:01.869 --> 27:04.627
Why are you sleeping
here, anyway?

27:05.420 --> 27:06.190
Uh...

27:06.674 --> 27:10.487
I had a bit of a fallout
with my folks.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.220
They think I lack focus.

27:15.064 --> 27:17.128
They want me to meet a nice girl.

27:22.740 --> 27:25.959
I don't think you should stay here.
Somebody's going to find you.

27:35.008 --> 27:36.513
What is it, anyway?

27:38.261 --> 27:39.977
Pete wants you to
come back to work.

27:43.492 --> 27:45.198
Well, what are you going to do?

27:47.464 --> 27:48.631
This.

27:56.072 --> 27:57.426
Do you want to mess about?

27:58.208 --> 27:59.429
Not now.

28:01.219 --> 28:02.193
Um...

28:03.471 --> 28:06.885
Somebody's asked me to go
on a photoshoot.

28:09.332 --> 28:10.457
What?

28:11.425 --> 28:13.505
It's really good, Jakob.
He's a nice guy.

28:13.505 --> 28:15.791
He does clothes stuff.
He came into the cafe

28:15.799 --> 28:18.616
- and he said that he'd seen our photos...
- You're going to do clothes porn

28:18.632 --> 28:21.238
for some fucking guy
that walks into the cafe?

28:22.162 --> 28:23.235
It's not porn.

28:23.251 --> 28:26.274
- Don't be silly.
- I don't want... you to do it.

28:29.213 --> 28:29.942
OK.

28:37.923 --> 28:39.025
You already did.

28:40.033 --> 28:40.962
Uh... no.

28:41.049 --> 28:42.941
- No...
- Don't lie.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.935
- Look...
- Don't fucking lie to me, OK?!

28:47.022 --> 28:50.741
Jakob, come on, look, I got some
money, OK? Cash. They paid me.

28:50.780 --> 28:53.950
So I thought, like, you can have
some because I don't need all of it,

28:54.056 --> 28:56.863
and then, um, I thought, maybe
I could introduce you to Marcel.

28:56.870 --> 28:58.872
What the fuck?
What the fuck is Marcel?!

28:59.339 --> 29:00.177
He's nice.

29:00.218 --> 29:03.279
This isn't what we do.
You don't do that!

29:04.185 --> 29:05.425
Did he screw you?

29:05.434 --> 29:06.556
- Right?
- Jakob!

29:06.580 --> 29:09.422
Banged your sweet little pussy
inside out?

29:10.220 --> 29:13.115
Did you show him your tits?
Was he into them?

29:16.858 --> 29:18.184
Don't come back!

29:18.206 --> 29:19.982
Don't fucking come back!

29:28.121 --> 29:29.667
Idiot.

29:30.057 --> 29:31.439
Cassie?

29:40.966 --> 29:42.016
Are you OK?

29:51.120 --> 29:53.373
Can you be friends with a boy
and not fuck them?

29:54.163 --> 29:56.626
Ah...

29:57.656 --> 30:00.438
You CAN be friends
and not fuck them...

30:01.781 --> 30:03.567
after you've fucked them.

30:05.825 --> 30:07.124
I saw him.

30:08.158 --> 30:09.019
Who?

30:12.620 --> 30:16.275
That guy you see. The suit man.

30:16.806 --> 30:18.186
Mark?

30:18.703 --> 30:20.271
Yeah. He was at this party.

30:20.509 --> 30:21.329
Yeah?

30:21.962 --> 30:24.276
He was on a bit of
a lech, actually.

30:24.780 --> 30:26.717
Yeah, he would be.

30:28.180 --> 30:29.831
So I stole his coke.

30:33.204 --> 30:34.724
You're cool.

30:37.632 --> 30:38.809
Don't you mind?

30:39.711 --> 30:41.298
I mean, he is sort of
your boyfriend.

30:41.517 --> 30:42.807
Um...

30:44.379 --> 30:47.019
London's fucked up.

30:47.676 --> 30:49.235
I mean...

30:50.639 --> 30:52.239
I go to auditions

30:52.540 --> 30:56.540
for my glorious acting career...

30:57.642 --> 31:00.930
and nothing ever happens.

31:02.936 --> 31:04.522
It's all fucked.

31:05.863 --> 31:07.480
And yet, here we stay.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.367
Fucked.

31:12.045 --> 31:13.753
We're waiting, you know?

31:14.900 --> 31:16.545
For our lives to start.

31:22.568 --> 31:23.228
Hey?

31:24.403 --> 31:25.325
Cass?

31:26.460 --> 31:27.318
Cass.

31:28.030 --> 31:29.148
Hey!

31:30.595 --> 31:32.837
Hey, it's fine.

31:36.491 --> 31:37.823
I fucked up...

32:23.440 --> 32:26.336
Yaniv, come. Check it out.

32:27.729 --> 32:29.204
Like, am I going crazy?

32:29.860 --> 32:31.024
Fuck...

32:32.086 --> 32:34.284
Cassie?

32:41.726 --> 32:42.940
Are there a lot?

32:43.488 --> 32:45.368
You look incredible.

32:46.196 --> 32:47.504
Thanks. It's, um...

32:47.598 --> 32:49.008
It's not that hard.

32:52.424 --> 32:53.680
Yeah, it is.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.254
Excuse me.

33:02.342 --> 33:03.778
Who took these?

33:04.897 --> 33:06.342
Some guy. It's nothing.

33:07.317 --> 33:09.185
It's not nothing.
You should look.

33:28.796 --> 33:30.286
Cassie...

33:31.779 --> 33:33.251
where's Jakob?

33:35.344 --> 33:36.587
How should I know?

33:38.262 --> 33:39.632
Something happen?

34:05.745 --> 34:06.951
Hey!

34:07.546 --> 34:09.021
Let me walk with you.

34:10.094 --> 34:12.206
- Why?
- I want to see where you live.

34:12.377 --> 34:14.427
I don't want you to know
where I live.

34:15.620 --> 34:19.851
You think I'm just a stupid fucking Israeli
paratrooper who wants something, huh?

34:20.808 --> 34:23.949
Whatever I want, OK,
whatever I feel...

34:25.714 --> 34:28.425
I have a lot of discipline, OK?
I have rules.

34:29.418 --> 34:33.418
I would never do something
that would hurt you or upset you.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.554
I would never do something
to make you feel bad, OK?

34:38.234 --> 34:40.889
I would never ask you
to do something you didn't want.

34:44.980 --> 34:46.351
I'll take you home.

34:48.936 --> 34:50.753
I don't want to go there.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.091
Why?

34:53.860 --> 34:55.234
I just don't.

34:56.411 --> 34:57.400
OK.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.906
So let's walk. Come.

35:00.340 --> 35:01.602
Come.

35:10.220 --> 35:13.300
- Come on, fucking thing.

35:13.628 --> 35:17.367
I keep asking the Arab for a new key.
It's a fucking joke.

35:19.274 --> 35:20.733
OK, we're in.

35:21.079 --> 35:22.578
Beautiful. Let's go.

35:24.135 --> 35:25.455
I should go.

35:25.943 --> 35:27.162
It's too far.

35:27.676 --> 35:32.555
It's OK. Listen, come, you can sleep.
I won't... you know?

35:38.133 --> 35:39.418
Cassie...

35:40.571 --> 35:42.285
everyone gets lonely here.

35:43.769 --> 35:44.919
It's OK.

36:09.278 --> 36:10.505
I'm tired.

36:12.340 --> 36:13.731
So you can sleep.

36:14.575 --> 36:16.485
We can talk about him tomorrow.

36:17.140 --> 36:18.397
There's nothing to say.

36:21.540 --> 36:23.196
So let it go, OK?

36:30.260 --> 36:32.863
Don't you ever want to go home,
Yaniv?

36:34.639 --> 36:35.424
No.

36:36.659 --> 36:38.556
Everyone hates there, you know?

36:39.873 --> 36:41.113
It's the same here.

36:42.580 --> 36:43.834
Here it's OK.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.725
If I can't, does it matter?

37:20.290 --> 37:21.771
Everything matters.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.417
- Leave it.

37:26.430 --> 37:28.678
No, my brother e-mails me.

37:40.917 --> 37:41.952
It's OK?

37:43.462 --> 37:44.352
Yeah.

37:45.861 --> 37:46.521
What?

37:47.078 --> 37:48.540
It's nothing.

37:54.180 --> 37:57.100
No. It's not important. Yaniv...

37:57.100 --> 37:59.578
Yaniv, please, no!

38:15.180 --> 38:17.100
Yaniv, no!

38:17.100 --> 38:21.100
Yaniv, stop!

38:35.770 --> 38:36.635
I'm sorry.

38:37.891 --> 38:39.237
Tell him to go.

38:41.300 --> 38:43.350
Don't be stupid.

38:57.660 --> 38:59.472
Don't spoil it, Jakob.

39:01.819 --> 39:03.997
We have to remember
something good.

39:09.740 --> 39:10.954
You're right.

39:12.180 --> 39:13.727
Everything matters.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.220
Cassie...

39:21.587 --> 39:22.471
Cassie!

39:27.915 --> 39:29.134
Cassie!

39:29.946 --> 39:31.289
Cassie!

39:34.855 --> 39:36.118
It's OK. That's it.

39:36.907 --> 39:37.780
It's finished.

39:38.492 --> 39:39.953
That's all we get.

39:42.373 --> 39:43.300
It's OK.

40:01.916 --> 40:02.934
Cassie?

40:04.163 --> 40:06.428
- Oh... Hi.
- That's so strange.

40:06.438 --> 40:06.949
Yeah.

40:06.974 --> 40:09.370
I was literally just thinking
about you, and you're here.

40:09.380 --> 40:11.564
- I come here every morning.
- Really?

40:16.025 --> 40:17.448
Pete's been trying to call you.

40:18.291 --> 40:19.147
Yeah.

40:19.466 --> 40:22.424
- I don't really want to...
- Yaniv told me what happened.

40:26.980 --> 40:28.449
It got a bit mixed up.

40:30.541 --> 40:31.556
He's left.

40:32.612 --> 40:33.540
Where to?

40:34.150 --> 40:37.160
I'm not sure. You know how it is.

40:40.032 --> 40:41.516
You're going to do something.

40:42.446 --> 40:43.899
Something fantastic.

40:45.872 --> 40:48.183
That's what I was thinking
about back there.

40:49.527 --> 40:51.269
Something's coming.

40:52.227 --> 40:53.753
You're magic.

40:54.656 --> 40:59.098
It's lucky for you. I'm just going to carry
on serving fried slices in Pete's caff.

41:03.730 --> 41:05.083
Drop in and see us some time.

41:06.068 --> 41:07.271
I will.

41:28.233 --> 41:29.649
Maddie?

42:37.589 --> 42:41.069
I'm sorry. Everyone's away.
I don't have anything in.

42:41.084 --> 42:42.844
No, no. We don't mind.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.846
We ate on the bus, didn't we?

42:44.864 --> 42:46.287
We ate crisps.

42:46.756 --> 42:49.023
Right... There you are.

42:51.467 --> 42:52.834
We wanted to see you.

42:53.980 --> 42:56.909
We missed you loads and
loads, didn't we, Rueby?

42:57.353 --> 43:00.212
I missed you, and Dad said
we could come.

43:02.070 --> 43:02.823
Right.

43:04.457 --> 43:06.777
We're going on a trip.

43:06.847 --> 43:10.174
- We wanted to see you before we went.
- Where?

43:11.079 --> 43:12.333
Italy.

43:16.290 --> 43:17.850
I stopped drinking.

43:18.490 --> 43:21.135
For four weeks, two days.

43:23.443 --> 43:24.913
Right, um...

43:25.718 --> 43:26.752
That's good.

43:27.065 --> 43:28.526
It's brilliant.

43:31.953 --> 43:33.781
Just... if...

43:33.964 --> 43:36.971
I can get away, I can
get something going.

43:36.995 --> 43:40.404
Maybe... do some teaching.

43:41.014 --> 43:42.401
Maybe do some painting.

43:43.384 --> 43:44.736
And what about school?

43:45.264 --> 43:48.713
I'm going to parliamo Italiano.

43:52.991 --> 43:55.418
If that's the right thing.

44:04.437 --> 44:05.673
What if...?

44:08.478 --> 44:09.518
Rueben?

44:10.143 --> 44:11.177
What?

44:12.096 --> 44:14.019
What if you stayed here?

44:15.730 --> 44:20.994
What if you stayed here, and
we let Dad parliamo Italiano?

44:22.329 --> 44:25.197
- Until he comes back?
- Yeah.

44:25.812 --> 44:27.833
Until he comes back to us.

44:29.770 --> 44:32.898
He's going to go on a trip
because he's been sad, right?

44:33.177 --> 44:34.735
Because Mum died.

44:35.048 --> 44:36.322
Because Mum died.
