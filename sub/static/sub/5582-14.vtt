WEBVTT

00:05.239 --> 00:06.340
* Pump it up

00:06.374 --> 00:08.442
* Feel it

00:08.476 --> 00:10.111
* Pump it up!

00:12.213 --> 00:15.249
That's right, my friends,
it's Mardi Gras, Fat Tuesday!

00:16.650 --> 00:17.618
Time to cut it loose,

00:17.651 --> 00:18.652
get the Devil out ya!

00:18.686 --> 00:20.788
I want to send
a big shout-out

00:20.821 --> 00:23.791
to my man, our host
this evening, Mayor Hamilton.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.626
Come on up here,
Mr. Mayor!

00:25.659 --> 00:27.461
Hey!

00:27.495 --> 00:29.430
Here he is--
John Cleary!

00:31.799 --> 00:32.833
How you doing?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.635
Yeah!

00:34.668 --> 00:36.170
All right, well, you know,

00:36.204 --> 00:38.372
New York has New Year's Eve.

00:38.406 --> 00:41.242
And Boston's St. Pat's

00:41.275 --> 00:43.444
has its charms.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.146
But no one,

00:45.179 --> 00:47.248
no one

00:47.281 --> 00:49.117
knows how to party

00:49.150 --> 00:50.784
like we do.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.120
Am I right?

00:52.153 --> 00:54.188
New Orleans!

00:54.222 --> 00:56.790
John Cleary!

00:56.824 --> 00:59.327
Tom, you are a lucky man.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.095
You're my chief of staff

01:01.129 --> 01:03.231
and you're married to
this divine creature.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.233
Huh?

01:05.266 --> 01:06.734
Oh, Mr. Mayor,
you are too kind.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.669
Mm-hmm.
The city loves you, Doug.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.774
Ah...

01:13.807 --> 01:16.110
Now, that is some dress.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.145
Devils only night.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.446
Hmm.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.615
Well, like Oscar Wilde
always said:

01:21.649 --> 01:24.785
"I can resist everything
except... temptation."

01:24.818 --> 01:26.754
* We got a whole lot of soul

01:26.787 --> 01:29.823
* Yeah, oh, a little love...

01:29.857 --> 01:31.425
Is that a new one?

01:31.459 --> 01:32.826
Yes, ma'am.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.562
Just make sure
he's back in an hour

01:34.595 --> 01:35.796
to shake the parade king's hand.

01:35.829 --> 01:36.830
Copy that.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.733
MONO's taking a breather.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.335
My people keep a room for me.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.304
It's right over there.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.273
Oh...

01:45.306 --> 01:47.475
Where's the sin in that?

01:49.677 --> 01:51.345
Mmm!

01:51.379 --> 01:52.913
A dare?

01:52.946 --> 01:53.914
Ooh, I like you.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.584
Yeah.
Oh, okay.

01:56.617 --> 02:00.188
* Oh, baby

02:00.221 --> 02:02.523
* Don't be so cruel

02:02.556 --> 02:05.259
* Oh, oh...

02:10.864 --> 02:13.901
(applause, cheering,
whistling, whooping)

02:13.934 --> 02:15.369
Man, it's a good thing
you done up in here,

02:15.403 --> 02:16.904
opening up the Tru-tone.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.272
Oh, thanks, man.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.274
Had to breathe some life

02:20.308 --> 02:22.243
back into the place
for my mama.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.278
Oh, she'd really be
proud of you.
Thanks.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.879
Hey, King, there's a guy
out back that needs you

02:25.913 --> 02:27.281
to sign for a liquor delivery?

02:27.315 --> 02:29.317
Thanks.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.218
Excuse me?

02:30.251 --> 02:31.219
We got it for you.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.586
I know you got it
for me.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.921
Let's keep this party going.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.290
Let's get down and dirty
up in here.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.359
One, two, three, oh!

02:42.596 --> 02:44.265
Hello?

03:00.248 --> 03:02.850
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:02.883 --> 03:05.486
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

03:05.519 --> 03:07.788
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:07.821 --> 03:09.290
* How, how, how, how

03:09.323 --> 03:11.659
* Hey, hey

03:17.498 --> 03:18.866
* You gotta come on.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.237
HAMILTON :
Dwayne?

03:25.373 --> 03:27.375
:
Dwayne?

03:36.484 --> 03:38.786
Hamilton?

03:38.819 --> 03:40.821
Dwayne...

03:47.995 --> 03:49.863
So...

03:49.897 --> 03:51.732
some party, huh?

03:56.870 --> 03:58.972
Got a feeling the party's
just getting started.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.811
Happy grand opening, King!
WOMEN: Happy grand opening,
Pride!

04:05.313 --> 04:07.415
Oh, he's gonna
just love it.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.383
Where's Patton?
He's supposed to bring

04:09.417 --> 04:10.784
the King Cake from Randazzo's.

04:10.818 --> 04:11.885
SONJA:
Called.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.853
Late. Ah...

04:12.886 --> 04:14.888
BRODY:
Finding that little baby

04:14.922 --> 04:16.924
inside the King Cake, yet
another New Orleans tradition

04:16.957 --> 04:18.459
that I love!
Right?

04:18.492 --> 04:20.394
It's so sweet.
Only Mardi Gras

04:20.428 --> 04:21.762
didn't start in New Orleans.

04:21.795 --> 04:22.963
It started in Alabama.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.031
Shut up.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.833
Yeah the lore is Mobile had

04:25.866 --> 04:28.436
the big parties and big floats
way before New Orleans.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.437
"The lore"?

04:31.705 --> 04:35.576
Dead Marine
and a wounded security guard

04:35.609 --> 04:36.744
at Landon Court Hotel.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.346
Mayor's SoirÃ©e is there tonight.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.780
Well, my invitation must've

04:39.813 --> 04:41.048
gotten lost in the mail.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.483
Clearly.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.784
Yeah, streets are packed.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.085
Be easier to walk.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.887
I'll get Pride and
meet you guys there.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.792
Just like to go
on record as saying

04:51.825 --> 04:54.061
this is not my kind of party.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.534
HAMILTON:
Well, whoever you are,

05:00.568 --> 05:02.836
all hell is coming in here.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.572
The mayor...

05:04.605 --> 05:05.839
...and a Fed?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.908
That is,

05:07.941 --> 05:09.843
that is some poor planning, son.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.011
Poor planning.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.013
I'm not sure about that.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.549
Something like this
takes time.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.818
Coordination.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.524
Oh, the girl in
the red dress.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.058
"Girl"?

05:25.092 --> 05:28.396
She's your partner, wasn't she?

05:28.429 --> 05:30.398
What's the matter-- these
digs too low

05:30.431 --> 05:31.799
Is that it?

05:34.134 --> 05:37.438
She's a... constituent.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.774
Wanted a private meeting.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.814
Is there some way
you'd like us to address you?

05:50.918 --> 05:53.754
You got a name?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.556
What the hell, Dwayne?

05:56.990 --> 05:58.492
Hey, Pride?

05:58.526 --> 05:59.627
Pride?

06:01.995 --> 06:03.130
He put up a fight.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.832
Excuse me?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.000
Right about where
your loafers are now.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.502
The man who dropped this?

06:08.536 --> 06:10.404
I busk for tips.

06:10.438 --> 06:13.040
Mardi Gras
is my busiest night.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.975
I was just taking a break

06:15.008 --> 06:17.545
when I saw this guy in a mask

06:17.578 --> 06:20.681
hit him with that,

06:20.714 --> 06:24.485
and then shove him in a car.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.554
You get a license plate?

06:39.199 --> 06:41.935
See anyone near the body?
Any witnesses?

06:41.969 --> 06:45.172
No, and the deceased
was working for hotel security.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.441
Moonlighting for the
mayor's event, but he--

06:47.475 --> 06:49.176
he's not one of ours.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.911
And you are?
Kelly Grace.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.846
Mayor's press secretary.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.883
This is Tom Bujei, Chief of
Staff and Brad Curry is--

06:55.916 --> 06:57.017
Brad Curry,
Mayor's Deputy Counsel.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.752
I'm the one
who contacted the Feds.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.789
Hang on, Brad, okay,
we have bigger problems--

07:01.822 --> 07:04.525
The problem is lying right
in there, Tom-- the dead Marine.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.960
Okay, everyone
just take a step back.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.230
Look, Mr. Curry, tell the
security to lock down the hotel.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.699
No one in or out.
Thank you.

07:13.901 --> 07:14.935
Ms. Loretta?

07:14.968 --> 07:17.638
Uh, it's military I.D.

07:17.671 --> 07:21.542
He's Corporal Jason Alex,
stationed at Bell Chase.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.144
Cause of death?

07:26.046 --> 07:28.015
Whatever was in this.

07:28.048 --> 07:31.184
Might be the same thing
that drugged Officer Tate.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.654
SONJA: Officer Tate,

07:33.687 --> 07:35.088
can you tell me
what happened?

07:36.857 --> 07:39.893
I saw the woman in
the red dress run by.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.029
I went back to find MONO.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.131
And I felt a sharp
pain in my neck.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.132
"MONO"?

07:45.165 --> 07:47.000
Mayor of New Orleans.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.102
(phone ringtone playing
ragtime melody)

07:53.674 --> 07:55.142
That's his phone.
I recognize the ringtone.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.744
SONJA:
The mayor's phone?

07:56.777 --> 07:57.745
BUJEI: Yes, it's his.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.880
He's missing.
Hello?

07:59.913 --> 08:01.715
We think he may have
been kidnapped.

08:01.749 --> 08:02.883
Wait--

08:02.916 --> 08:04.117
Brody, what?

08:06.053 --> 08:07.555
What is it?

08:07.588 --> 08:10.257
Pride's been taken, too.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.162
What did we do?

08:15.195 --> 08:16.129
Don't know.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.699
Maybe nothing.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.803
Well, either way...

08:22.836 --> 08:24.838
a lot of folks love us, so...

08:24.872 --> 08:28.008
they must've noticed
that we're gone.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.010
What?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.278
Mardi Gras?

08:31.311 --> 08:33.614
Oh.
So...

08:35.182 --> 08:37.084
I mean, what is
the camera for?

08:37.117 --> 08:38.719
What is that?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.322
Unless, I mean,

08:42.355 --> 08:44.992
Do you think
it's

08:45.025 --> 08:46.293
Is it terrorism?

08:46.326 --> 08:48.061
Mr. Mayor, you--
It's terrorism, isn't it?

08:48.095 --> 08:50.063
Hey!

08:50.097 --> 08:54.802
Hey, so is that why you have
D

08:54.835 --> 08:56.169
Douglas...
Two of us?

08:56.203 --> 08:57.304
Are you a damn terrorist?

08:57.337 --> 08:59.673
Are you
a damn terrorist?!

08:59.707 --> 09:00.908
Calm down.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.679
I got a lot of rich friends.
Lot of rich friends.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.781
Just tell us what you want.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.250
Sir?

09:12.219 --> 09:13.987
Why are we here?

09:16.223 --> 09:17.925
To confess.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.111
BRODY: All right, Patton,
what do we got?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.947
Wait, just wait.

09:39.980 --> 09:40.981
Okay, can't wait.

09:41.014 --> 09:41.982
Pride's been kidnapped,

09:42.015 --> 09:43.083
the mayor's been kidnapped.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.918
Cats and dogs--
know what I mean?

09:44.952 --> 09:45.986
Well, who's watching the bar?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.655
A silver-painted man

09:47.688 --> 09:50.090
and about a hundred
of Pride's closest friends.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.391
Cats and dogs?

09:51.424 --> 09:53.126
Okay.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.295
The mayor and an NCIS agent

09:55.328 --> 09:57.230
get kidnapped on Mardi Gras.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.099
This is too much
of a coincidence.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.002
Maybe someone trying
to send a message?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.270
I dumped Pride's phone.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.972
No threatening calls.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.907
I checked with
FBI, Homeland.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.843
No terror threats or chatter.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.645
Someone they both know then?

10:11.679 --> 10:14.815
Maybe-maybe a suspect
from a past case.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.116
I'll pull old cases
and cross-reference them

10:16.149 --> 10:17.317
with Hamilton.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.386
All right,
my-my silver-painted friend

10:19.419 --> 10:22.956
said he saw a gray Ford sedan,
license plate TSJ.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.925
Track it, wide BOLO.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.294
Roads, highways, airports.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.829
Okay, I'm on it.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.831
I called the FBI for support.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.033
They're at least an hour out,
'cause of traffic.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.702
Wait, if they can't get in,

10:34.735 --> 10:36.837
then maybe our-our kidnapper
wasn't able to get out.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.107
Cracking street cams.
Looking for this gray sedan.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.141
It's gonna take some time.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.710
Okay, we don't have time.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.211
First hour of a kidnapping
is crucial.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.813
It's when things
can go from bad to worse.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.180
You don't think I know this?

10:48.181 --> 10:48.982
We're gonna find him.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.287
LASALLE:
Anyone claim responsibility?

10:54.321 --> 10:55.422
Any ransom demands?

10:55.455 --> 10:57.257
The only calls
are from the press.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.126
They want to talk to the mayor

10:59.159 --> 11:00.260
before he shakes
the parade king's hand.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.262
Which is less
than an hour away.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.297
So it would be
great to resolve this

11:04.331 --> 11:06.099
sooner than later.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.969
Look, I'm sorry,
but it's a big deal.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.138
Curry, you're deputy counsel?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.941
Know of any claims
against the mayor?

11:13.974 --> 11:15.175
Anyone who's angry?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.343
No, and what makes you think

11:16.376 --> 11:17.811
this isn't about your guy?

11:17.845 --> 11:20.047
Well, we can debate
character later.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.216
All right, our best chance
is to find this girl.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.819
Do any of you know her?
Talk to her?

11:25.853 --> 11:27.254
God, no!

11:27.287 --> 11:28.989
TATE:
She knew just where
to take him.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.323
No surveillance in that alcove.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.126
There's a service entrance
nearby.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.228
Ms. Loretta?

11:35.262 --> 11:36.797
You still here?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.098
It's Mardi Gras.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.767
My police escort
needs a police escort

11:39.800 --> 11:42.235
to help me get
Corporal Alex to the morgue.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.737
But, while I wait,

11:43.771 --> 11:46.339
you see this swelling
and rigidity around the eyes?

11:46.373 --> 11:49.276
Could be a reaction to
the drug he was given.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.811
We find out what kind of drug,

11:50.844 --> 11:52.746
and we figure out
who had access to it.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.381
I'll get it to Sebastian,
get him started.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.883
Thank you.
Keep me posted.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.050
Got something!

11:58.385 --> 12:01.021
I think this is MONO's girl.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.155
See the chick in the coat?

12:02.189 --> 12:03.056
Red sequins,
that's her.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.026
Good.
All right,
we'll take the ballroom.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.761
Your team has the floors.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.396
I'll get this over to Patton,
see if can get an I.D.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.898
Wait!

12:10.931 --> 12:12.399
Best not to involve
too many people.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.534
I mean, we don't want a citywide
panic on Mardi Gras.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.403
Absolutely, we need to keep this
out of the glare of the media

12:16.436 --> 12:18.405
until we know
what we're dealing with.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.506
Hey, do us a favor.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.374
Stop worrying about the PR.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.211
And start worrying about
the mayor and Pride's lives.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.419
Do you think this
is some sort of

12:32.452 --> 12:35.388
weird ritual or something?

12:35.422 --> 12:39.059
It's Mardi Gras-- it's the night
before Ash Wednesday.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.028
Everybody's got to atone.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.362
Timing does seem right.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.264
Well, what are we supposed
to be confessing to?

12:44.297 --> 12:46.133
I mean, who is this guy, anyway?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.367
Is he some drug dealer
that you pissed off?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.903
Is he a spy or something?

12:49.937 --> 12:52.940
Not sure he's an NCIS interest.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.308
What is he doing back there?

12:55.342 --> 12:58.145
Douglas? Douglas...

12:58.178 --> 13:00.814
listen to me-- you need
to let me do the talking.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.283
Oh, see, there you go
selling me short again, Dwayne.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.152
People like talking to me.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.586
They tell me a lot of things.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.288
How do you think I became mayor?

13:08.321 --> 13:12.192
The other candidate was flooding
your district with drugs.

13:12.225 --> 13:15.595
Yeah, well, I don't feel like
talking about that right now.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.596
Really?
Yeah--

13:16.629 --> 13:18.165
Shut up!

13:19.867 --> 13:21.301
Time to confess!

13:21.334 --> 13:24.037
Be helpful if you could tell us
what we were guilty of.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.873
What you think we're guilty of.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.443
This is all a joke
to you, isn't it...

13:30.477 --> 13:32.379
Mayor?

13:32.412 --> 13:36.316
Douglas Hamilton,
divorced, two kids--

13:36.349 --> 13:38.451
Max and Sam,
both at Ridgefield Prep.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.220
Agent Dwayne Pride.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.454
Also divorced,

13:41.488 --> 13:42.856
likes to sleep at work.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.324
Daughter Laurel
is at college.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.894
Main dorm, room 23.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.095
What have you done with them?

13:48.128 --> 13:49.162
Easy, Mayor.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.498
Your families are safe for now,

13:51.531 --> 13:53.166
as long as I get what I want.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.267
No.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.403
I want a guarantee.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.006
And I'm not gonna say
a word until I get one!

14:00.607 --> 14:03.243
* Now, some things come
and some things go *

14:03.276 --> 14:05.445
* But there's one thing
that stays for sure... *

14:05.478 --> 14:07.114
You think this is a militia?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.916
Maybe Hamilton's
involved somehow?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.417
Well, Patton
didn't find anything.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.552
Has Pride been
telling you something?

14:12.585 --> 14:14.187
Me? Of course not.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.555
You know him better than I do.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.458
Yeah, well,
he talks to you, too.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.660
Look, Pride is gone.
I'm worried, okay?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.396
Yeah, so am I.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.432
On the inside.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.968
*

14:35.242 --> 14:36.643
Red sequins, 12:00.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.118
Oh!
Oh!

14:55.462 --> 14:58.465
Federal agents!
Stop!

15:01.334 --> 15:02.569
Put the knife down!

15:02.602 --> 15:04.604
Sure...

15:18.518 --> 15:19.619
What the hell
are they clapping for?

15:19.652 --> 15:22.255
I think the three of us.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.557
We'll be here
every Tuesday night, hey!

15:24.591 --> 15:26.493
Happy Mardi Gras!

15:32.332 --> 15:33.500
You could leave now.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.336
Free us.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.438
We haven't even seen your face.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.540
Don't know who you are.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.976
You want to know who I am?

15:43.010 --> 15:46.113
All right, fine.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.524
Recognize me, Mayor?

15:59.059 --> 16:02.529
But you do,
don't you, Agent Pride?

16:08.535 --> 16:10.170
Mike Spar.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.538
Yeah.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.207
I remember.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.209
You two know each other?

16:16.243 --> 16:20.047
We met when I was
with the sheriff's office.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.514
25 years ago.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.051
Got looped into a NOPD case.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.353
Victim was from my parish.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.421
Had to deliver
the death notification.

16:28.455 --> 16:31.391
My... first time.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.592
"Your wife killed herself."

16:32.625 --> 16:34.727
That's what you said.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.597
I never forgot
you standing there

16:37.630 --> 16:40.300
with that little girl
in your arms.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.769
She's why we're here.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.304
Your daughter?

16:47.107 --> 16:50.477
Stacey grew up thinking
her mom abandoned her.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.147
But we know
that's not the truth.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.748
You and I

16:55.782 --> 16:59.018
both know
that he murdered her.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.372
This has got to be some mistake.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.608
Agent Pride
may have been involved

17:21.641 --> 17:23.843
in whatever you think happened.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.645
But not me.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.714
I was in law school
25 years ago!

17:27.747 --> 17:31.651
Yes, and an alumni
of Sigma Eta Omicron Fraternity!

17:31.684 --> 17:34.654
They had a Mardi Gras party
at the Alastair Hotel!

17:34.687 --> 17:36.623
Party your wife attended
the night she died.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.091
I remember.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.326
Of course you do.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.395
You were part of the cover-up.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.497
That's you.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.099
You were part of
the investigation.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.534
You were there.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.470
I was called to the scene
of a suicide.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.639
Told a woman
with a history of depression

17:52.672 --> 17:56.443
had used a frat party
as a means to end it all.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.577
I...
"I accept

17:57.610 --> 17:59.579
"or reject a hypothesis

17:59.612 --> 18:01.414
based on evidence."

18:01.448 --> 18:03.516
Scientist's creed.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.352
Should be a cop's, too.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.187
Witness statements
from five

18:07.220 --> 18:09.589
of Hamilton's
fraternity brothers.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.359
"Patricia acted crazy.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.626
"Threatened she would
kill herself.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.195
Was alone when she jumped."

18:15.228 --> 18:16.629
Familiar names.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.198
Yeah, they've
all been appointed

18:18.231 --> 18:20.600
positions in Hamilton's
administration!

18:20.633 --> 18:22.302
You think I killed your wife,

18:22.335 --> 18:25.272
because I did a couple
of frat buddies some favors?

18:25.305 --> 18:27.607
You were on the guest list!

18:27.640 --> 18:31.511
But the cops
never interviewed you!

18:31.544 --> 18:34.481
He never interviewed you.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.150
Because I wasn't there!

18:37.184 --> 18:39.319
And I'm sorry to say this,

18:39.352 --> 18:41.821
but it sounds like
your wife had some issues.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.490
No, that is not true.
Doug...

18:43.523 --> 18:44.591
Doug, take it easy!
No, I'm saying--

18:44.624 --> 18:46.493
Look, it's the type of thing

18:46.526 --> 18:47.794
that would force people
to make a bad decision!

18:47.827 --> 18:49.662
I stayed at home
with a baby,

18:49.696 --> 18:51.298
so she could go out
with friends,

18:51.331 --> 18:52.532
do some networking.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.600
It was Mardi Gras.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.268
I said, "Go, have some fun."

18:55.302 --> 18:56.569
You know?

18:58.338 --> 19:01.874
And then you showed up
at my door.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.151
What are you thinking, Mike?

19:15.355 --> 19:18.525
I'm tired of playing games.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.431
I know my rights.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.732
I'm not saying anything.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.934
Angela Goodwin.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.536
Priors include possession

19:29.569 --> 19:30.337
and solicitation.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.272
You're stepping it up
to conspiracy,

19:32.305 --> 19:33.540
kidnapping, assault

19:33.573 --> 19:35.275
with a deadly weapon,

19:35.308 --> 19:36.443
murder?

19:38.345 --> 19:40.413
He said it was a joke.

19:40.447 --> 19:41.714
Who?

19:41.748 --> 19:43.283
The guy who paid me
$500 to flirt

19:43.316 --> 19:44.551
with the mayor
and get him alone.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.886
Getting the mayor alone.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.589
That didn't
strike you as strange?

19:49.622 --> 19:51.291
I've spent time with politicians
and their friends.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.892
They do strange things.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.495
Look, the guy said

19:55.528 --> 19:57.364
he was a fraternity brother
playing a prank.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.400
No one was supposed
to get hurt, I swear.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.668
Did he tell you his name?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.002
No.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.837
What'd he look like?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.339
Long, graying hair.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.007
Sad, but nice.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.343
He also had
a beard.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.578
I am telling you
the truth.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.380
I like the mayor.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.814
I voted for him.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.952
What's the plan here, Mike?

20:22.822 --> 20:24.357
You've got
that gun...

20:24.391 --> 20:25.458
and what?

20:27.294 --> 20:29.028
Murder two people?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.663
You're not this man, Mike.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.432
You think you know me?

20:32.465 --> 20:34.434
Know you're angry.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.336
Your daughter's hurtin'.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.370
Both desperate

20:37.404 --> 20:38.705
for answers.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.039
Been that way for too long.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.274
Sorry.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.676
That's not gonna change.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.445
Pride never talked to me

20:45.478 --> 20:47.380
because I was never
at that party.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.326
You sure about that, Douglas?

21:01.794 --> 21:03.363
MIKE:
That's you.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.634
Where did you get this?

21:07.667 --> 21:10.437
Law school archives.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.339
Took a couple years
of digging,

21:12.372 --> 21:14.774
but it was there.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.609
PRIDE:
You lied.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.345
With everything
that's at stake.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.648
That was damn reckless.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.986
Ran Angela's description
of the kidnapper

21:27.019 --> 21:29.322
through the hotel employee
records. No luck.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.890
Anything on the party guests?

21:30.923 --> 21:32.825
Hotel security is still
reviewing surveillance.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.495
Look, Angela mentioned
a fraternity prank.

21:35.528 --> 21:38.465
Is there any chance whoever took
the mayor is pulling one?

21:38.498 --> 21:40.667
There were a lot of pranks in
my frat days, some crazy stuff,

21:40.700 --> 21:42.502
but I doubt anyone would do
something like this.

21:45.372 --> 21:47.807
SEBASTIAN:
Pentobarbital.
Sebastian?

21:47.840 --> 21:50.343
Hey, yeah, I got to the lab
as soon as I could.

21:50.377 --> 21:52.379
I'm designated driver
for my new Krewe.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.348
It's a Krewe Livre.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.749
That's French for book.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.418
They're-they're my book club.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.987
I'm Mark Twain, obviously.
This is, uh,

22:01.020 --> 22:03.390
Flannery O'Connor, William
Faulkner, Truman Capote...

22:03.423 --> 22:04.724
Pentobarbital?

22:04.757 --> 22:06.393
Yeah, pentobarbital.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.994
I think it's the drug
that killed Corporal Alex.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.496
I determined it
based on the photos

22:09.529 --> 22:11.464
that Loretta sent me
of Alex's eyes.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.932
The swelling and muscle rigidity

22:12.965 --> 22:14.467
were caused by
an allergic reaction...

22:14.501 --> 22:17.036
malignant hyperthermia.
More, please.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.771
It's, uh, it's also
an anesthetic

22:18.805 --> 22:20.840
used in the cocktail
for lethal injections.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.009
And, uh...

22:23.042 --> 22:25.412
I'm officially scared right now.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.880
I mean,
Pride's like a dad to me.

22:27.914 --> 22:30.049
Even if he doesn't realize it.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.118
Maybe he does realize it
and he's just doing

22:32.151 --> 22:33.686
a reverse parenting thing,
like Atticus Finch before...

22:33.720 --> 22:35.021
Sebastian.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.389
Yeah, um... sorry.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.891
The drug is made
at compounding pharmacies.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.394
So our kidnapper
could be working at one.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.463
Well, the twist is that
there are secrecy laws

22:43.496 --> 22:45.532
that shield
lethal injection suppliers.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.400
Employee records
are kept under wraps.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.569
Well, then, we'll have
to unwrap them.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.405
All right,
five pharmacies

22:52.439 --> 22:54.407
in the Gulf region
provide pentobarbital.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.409
We need to check employee names
of every one of them

22:56.443 --> 22:58.010
and see if an of them
connect with Pride or Hamilton.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.446
PATTON:
What in the hell

22:59.479 --> 23:01.180
would a pharmacist want
with Pride anyway?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.649
BRODY:
No idea.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.116
Could be a developing interest

23:04.150 --> 23:05.618
he never had a chance
to tell us about.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.019
Seeing 75 employees

23:07.053 --> 23:08.655
who had clearance
to handle the drug.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.858
Cross-referencing
NCIS cases, the mayor...

23:11.891 --> 23:13.460
All right, what about
that gray sedan?

23:13.493 --> 23:15.562
Partial license TSJ.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.196
Checking DMV records.
BRODY:
Good.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.898
Because if one of them
drives it,

23:18.931 --> 23:21.501
we're one step closer
to finding Pride.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.202
Why did I even think
to trust you?

23:23.235 --> 23:25.137
It must be photoshopped.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.839
It's not what you think.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.541
Pick one, Douglas.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.776
He means stop lying!

23:30.510 --> 23:33.212
Stop... lying!

23:33.245 --> 23:35.047
Mike...
Confess!

23:35.081 --> 23:36.816
No! Mike, wait!

23:36.849 --> 23:38.585
Mike!

23:38.618 --> 23:39.852
Mike, take it easy.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.854
You can take this
to the D.A.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.490
No, the D.A. rejected a request

23:43.523 --> 23:45.592
to reopen the case
two weeks ago.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.560
Get up! Get up!

23:47.594 --> 23:48.595
Say it!
Mike...

23:48.628 --> 23:50.463
You killed her!
Say it!
Mike!

23:50.497 --> 23:51.664
Mike, this won't help Stacey.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.232
Don't do this.
Don't.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.834
The mayor's gonna confess.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.469
Confess!

23:57.504 --> 23:59.506
All right.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.607
I was there.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.756
*

24:20.827 --> 24:22.829
PATTON:
Of the pharmacists
who had access

24:22.862 --> 24:24.831
to the drug
that killed Corporal Alex,

24:24.864 --> 24:27.600
only one had a connection
to Pride or Hamilton.

24:27.634 --> 24:28.735
BRODY:
Mike Spar.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.637
Spar studied medicine
and chemistry

24:30.670 --> 24:32.505
at Hamilton's alma mater.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.106
And he owns a gray Taurus,

24:34.140 --> 24:35.842
the one Pride was seen
taken away in.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.810
Uses his own car...

24:37.844 --> 24:39.812
Doesn't sound like
a criminal mastermind to me.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.682
Uses a drug associated
with lethal injection.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.751
Sounds pretty James Bond to me.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.553
Okay, so he went
to Hamilton's school.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.688
What's the connection to Pride?

24:48.721 --> 24:52.859
Running Spar's name
against Pride's NCIS cases...

24:52.892 --> 24:54.260
Nothing.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.295
All right, let's go back
farther than that.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.931
Pride's old cases when he was
working sheriff's deputy.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.769
Got 'em, right here.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.671
Mike Spar.
His wife committed...

25:04.704 --> 25:07.073
suicide at a Mardi Gras party.

25:07.106 --> 25:10.877
Pride's JPSO report states
that he notified Spar.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.645
All right,
that's the connection.

25:12.679 --> 25:13.880
PATTON:
Spar's employee record

25:13.913 --> 25:15.748
lists his daughter
as an emergency contact.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.083
Trying to track her down.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.585
Spar has a place on Dauphine.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.952
His daughter could be there.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.721
If Pride and Hamilton
are still in the Quarter,

25:21.754 --> 25:23.556
it could be where
Mike Spar took them.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.592
We're closer.
I'll have SWAT meet me there.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.228
You either lied
because you killed her

25:29.261 --> 25:31.598
or you're
protecting someone.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.132
Oh, y

25:33.165 --> 25:34.601
Just a cop.

25:34.634 --> 25:35.935
Doing what the cops
should have done

25:35.968 --> 25:37.637
a long time ago.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.873
So, Mardi Gras night,

25:40.907 --> 25:42.308
25 years ago...

25:42.341 --> 25:43.309
Help!

25:43.342 --> 25:45.144
Somebody help me!

25:45.177 --> 25:47.680
Help me!

25:48.815 --> 25:50.116
No one can hear you.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.951
PRIDE:
Mardi Gras night.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.853
Tell me what happened.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.892
All right.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.730
I was there that night.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.667
But I did not see

26:07.700 --> 26:09.869
what happened to his wife.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.838
I left early, I swear.

26:11.871 --> 26:12.905
Why'd you lie?

26:12.939 --> 26:16.042
A party like that?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.677
Where a girl dies?

26:17.710 --> 26:19.979
Not good, if you've got
any political ambition.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.347
More.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.249
You're hiding something.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.184
I know you were at that party.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.886
I know you lied.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.088
We get out of here,

26:29.121 --> 26:31.624
I'll figure out why.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.401
There was...

26:42.434 --> 26:45.104
a ritual, of sorts.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.273
Behind closed doors.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.141
You've heard
the stories.

26:49.175 --> 26:52.712
And if anybody
knew I was there...

26:52.745 --> 26:55.381
I mean, I would
be destroyed.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.416
You lied for 25 years

26:57.449 --> 26:59.418
because you were part of
a sick fraternity ritual?

26:59.451 --> 27:00.787
HAMILTON:
More like

27:00.820 --> 27:04.691
you were obsessed
for 25 years, Mr. Spar.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.659
Not me.

27:06.693 --> 27:08.160
I had to put this away.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.262
BRODY:
Entering Spar's house. Stand by.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.664
MIKE:
Focus on my daughter.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.135
But...

27:16.168 --> 27:18.971
Stacey...

27:19.005 --> 27:21.307
she was the one
who couldn't move on.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.345
She had to know the truth.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.848
I told her her mother
died in an accident.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.752
She heard rumors and...

27:34.721 --> 27:36.789
I told her to ignore them.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.390
Let it go.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.392
She was the one who-who...

27:40.426 --> 27:42.228
spearheaded all of this?

27:42.261 --> 27:43.662
Yes.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.801
What she saw...

27:48.835 --> 27:51.070
it was too much for her.

27:51.103 --> 27:54.473
She started numbing herself,

27:54.506 --> 27:56.442
drinking too much,

27:56.475 --> 27:57.910
getting into drugs.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.248
I had to help her.

28:02.281 --> 28:05.718
She took it on, didn't she?

28:05.752 --> 28:07.253
Had to.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.687
Yeah.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.826
When you're abandoned,
there's a need to know.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.697
Now we're going
to work this case.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.301
We're gonna work this
for Stacey.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.338
Mike, what you found
in those files...

28:26.372 --> 28:27.840
the evidence.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.475
Patricia's injuries--

28:29.508 --> 28:31.844
any signs of a struggle?

28:31.878 --> 28:34.180
Cops, uh, didn't focus on
any of that stuff.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.983
But we are.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.517
Now, come on.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.287
Prove the hypothesis.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.255
While I start the autopsy
on Corporal Alex,

28:43.289 --> 28:45.758
I want you to take
a look at these.
Okay, what are they?

28:45.792 --> 28:47.493
Well, they're photos
Brody found

28:47.526 --> 28:49.328
in Mike Spar's house.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.231
It appears Spar and his daughter

28:52.264 --> 28:54.867
were investigating
his wife's suicide.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.068
Huh.

28:58.370 --> 28:59.872
There.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.374
Cuts, broken neck--
that speaks to the fall.
Huh.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.377
This spiral
fracture doesn't.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.446
Spiral fractures usually
don't happen in falls.

29:07.479 --> 29:10.883
More like...
industrial accidents.

29:10.917 --> 29:14.053
Or when someone... twists
someone else's arm in a fight.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.356
Maybe Patricia
struggled with someone

29:17.389 --> 29:19.258
before she went
over the balcony.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.960
Or she was pushed.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.762
You think she was murdered?

29:26.899 --> 29:29.235
Douglas...

29:29.268 --> 29:30.937
tell the truth.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.408
Well, it'd be a whole lot easier
if he got rid of that thing.

29:50.857 --> 29:53.492
When I left the party,

29:53.525 --> 29:56.562
I might've remembered

29:56.595 --> 29:59.899
seeing some guys
with his wife.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.367
Part of the ritual?

30:03.302 --> 30:05.938
Get her alone,
get her drunk.

30:05.972 --> 30:07.840
She fights them off.

30:07.874 --> 30:09.608
I told you I left early.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.110
Wait.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.579
The...

30:13.612 --> 30:15.581
necklace.

30:15.614 --> 30:19.518
When you saw her,
was she wearing a necklace?

30:19.551 --> 30:22.088
:
A pendant...

30:22.121 --> 30:23.622
in the shape of a rose.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.623
I don't remember.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.624
It-it's not mentioned

30:25.657 --> 30:26.625
in the police report.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.294
She was wearing one that night?

30:28.327 --> 30:29.328
I bought it for her

30:29.361 --> 30:30.429
the night our Stacey was born.

30:30.462 --> 30:31.630
She never
took it off.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.965
Oh, wait, hold it.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.301
One second.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.969
All right, that necklace.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.939
The rose, what...
did it have a sapphire?

30:39.972 --> 30:42.208
Yes.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.111
Did you take it?

30:45.144 --> 30:46.879
No!

30:46.913 --> 30:49.115
But I think I know who did.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.584
Oh, my God!

30:52.618 --> 30:54.887
This newspaper photo
of the investigation.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.022
Well, you're not
gonna get much

30:56.055 --> 30:57.356
out of that body
with the sheet on it.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.391
No, it's not the body.
It's this.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.128
This is a logo
on the carpet near the body

31:02.161 --> 31:04.396
of the old Alistair Hotel.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.932
The Alistair--
I never heard of it.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.900
Yeah, 'cause it closed
years and years ago.

31:07.934 --> 31:11.103
The owners gutted it,
but left some of it intact.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.604
What did they build
in its place?

31:12.638 --> 31:16.242
The Landon Court Hotel
on top of and around it.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.945
That's-that's
where the mayor's party is.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.446
And no one can figure out

31:20.479 --> 31:22.982
how Spar got the mayor
out of there.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.218
What if they never left?

31:26.252 --> 31:27.954
He-he-he somehow
restrains the mayor,

31:27.987 --> 31:29.321
goes and gets Pride,

31:29.355 --> 31:30.957
then returns
to the scene of the crime.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.925
Where his wife died
25 years ago.

31:32.959 --> 31:33.993
Sebastian...

31:34.961 --> 31:36.462
I think Hamilton and Pride

31:36.495 --> 31:38.998
are still somewhere
in that hotel.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.001
I... I didn't
make the connection

31:42.034 --> 31:44.937
till he said the thing
about the necklace.

31:44.971 --> 31:48.574
A couple years ago, I was
playing poker with some guys.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.009
Fraternity brothers?

31:51.710 --> 31:54.981
And one of them
talked about a necklace.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.582
Called it his trophy.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.717
Said it represented
what you can get away with

31:58.750 --> 32:00.486
if you know the right people.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.154
You know where the necklace is?

32:02.188 --> 32:04.223
Uh-huh.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.692
Who has it?

32:08.527 --> 32:09.628
Who killed my wife?

32:12.564 --> 32:14.266
Not until you let us go.

32:16.102 --> 32:17.069
Douglas!

32:17.103 --> 32:18.404
Not a negotiation!

32:18.437 --> 32:20.572
Who has it?!

32:20.606 --> 32:22.274
Tell me!

32:25.411 --> 32:26.645
Or Agent Pride dies.

32:43.429 --> 32:46.265
This map is
of the old Alistair Hotel.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.700
A... a hotel within a hotel?

32:48.734 --> 32:51.603
This is the medical
examiner's theory?

32:51.637 --> 32:53.372
You got a better one?

32:53.405 --> 32:56.008
All right, Spar
pays the girl.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.243
And she lures Hamilton.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.311
And then Spar attacks him

32:59.345 --> 33:01.080
and pulls him
into this service entrance.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.581
All right,
so the storage closet where

33:02.614 --> 33:04.050
Corporal Alex's body
was found, it looks like

33:04.083 --> 33:06.052
there's some kind
of tunnel behind it.

33:06.085 --> 33:08.787
But that doesn't explain
how Spar got to Agent Pride.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.722
This might--
Patton finally got a hit

33:10.756 --> 33:12.391
on the gray sedan
seen leaving the bar.

33:12.424 --> 33:15.061
It's parked on Madison Street.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.628
Well, there's
an old service entrance there.

33:16.662 --> 33:17.663
Yep.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.431
Spar restrains Hamilton,

33:19.465 --> 33:21.733
leaves through the service
entrance to get Pride,

33:21.767 --> 33:23.469
brings him back,
chaos of Mardi Gras,

33:23.502 --> 33:24.736
no one's the wiser.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.605
It was kind of the perfect plan.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.574
To what--
taking Pride and the mayor

33:28.607 --> 33:29.775
back to the scene
of his wife's suicide?

33:29.808 --> 33:31.277
Guy's a psychopath.

33:31.310 --> 33:32.644
Okay, we got to do this right.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.346
Is there anybody
this guys trusts

33:34.380 --> 33:36.382
Anyone we can get to talk to
him, if he makes contact?

33:36.415 --> 33:38.750
He's got a daughter and he's
trying to get in touch with her.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.819
You need me.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.788
And I'm not doing anything
without him.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.456
Tell me.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.160
Listen, Mike...

33:48.194 --> 33:50.729
God knows I'm no authority
on parenting.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.398
But I could learn
a thing or two from you.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.333
Yeah.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.368
Like putting my kid's welfare
before mine.

33:56.402 --> 33:58.737
Just like you did with Stacey.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.372
Stop.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.174
She's the reason
why we're here now.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.810
And she's the reason
why you need to let us go.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.079
Stop.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.582
Don't you want
to see Stacey again?

34:10.616 --> 34:12.584
Never gonna see her again.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.455
Why not?

34:18.124 --> 34:20.292
She's dead, isn't she?

34:23.262 --> 34:25.131
PATTON:
Bad news.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.566
Spar's daughter
died of a drug overdose.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.634
When?

34:28.667 --> 34:29.801
Two weeks ago.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.137
All right, thanks.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.272
Daughter's dead.
Drug overdose.

34:33.305 --> 34:35.141
So no family
to talk Spar down?

34:35.174 --> 34:36.475
Nope, it's up to us.

34:36.508 --> 34:38.144
All right, Percy and I
will take the tunnel.

34:38.177 --> 34:40.212
Tate, you got the
service entrance.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.248
TATE: Copy.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.222
He was never gonna let us go.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.858
Change the plan.

34:52.891 --> 34:55.794
It's been a suicide mission
from the start.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.463
Change it, Douglas.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.630
How?

34:58.664 --> 35:00.566
Who has the necklace?

35:02.268 --> 35:04.536
Who killed Patricia?

35:04.570 --> 35:06.538
A name-- give him...

35:06.572 --> 35:07.839
give him a name.

35:07.873 --> 35:11.177
Political suicide, Dwayne.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.544
An actual suicide.

35:12.578 --> 35:14.813
And I am not saying
a word with that thing on.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.915
You selfish son of a bitch!

35:16.948 --> 35:18.417
I'll figure it out,
Douglas.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.886
We get out of here...
you know I will.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.388
You know I will!

35:25.391 --> 35:27.259
Agent Lasalle,
I'm closing the gap.

35:28.394 --> 35:29.828
SONJA:
This is it.

35:29.861 --> 35:30.896
Down there.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.298
Let's roll.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.708
Let me see the picture.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.691
Fourth guy from the left.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.693
Tate?
TATE: In position.

36:06.465 --> 36:09.167
All she wanted.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.805
Needed, really.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.908
You think she knows we got him?

36:17.976 --> 36:19.978
Yes.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.381
I believe she does.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.384
They both do.

36:46.004 --> 36:49.007
Dwayne, cut me loose.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.377
NCIS!

36:51.410 --> 36:53.379
Get your hands up!
No, no, no, we're clear!

36:53.412 --> 36:55.213
Gun!
No!

36:56.748 --> 36:57.749
Pride!

36:59.318 --> 37:01.453
Pride!
Pride, are you hurt?

37:02.621 --> 37:04.423
You hit?

37:06.292 --> 37:07.025
Talk to me!

37:07.058 --> 37:08.427
Look, can you sit up?

37:26.345 --> 37:27.979
It was a camera,
not a gun.

37:28.013 --> 37:31.817
He was just trying
to be a good dad.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.892
Mayor...

37:40.926 --> 37:43.295
You're sure you're okay
to continue with the night?

37:43.329 --> 37:45.297
Don't I look okay, Tom?

37:45.331 --> 37:46.932
You look great!

37:46.965 --> 37:48.066
Handsome.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.735
Refreshed, even.
Thank you, Kelly.

37:49.768 --> 37:50.936
If I may so, sir.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.404
Thank you.
Sir, the parade king

37:52.438 --> 37:53.872
three minutes--
gotta shake his hand.

37:53.905 --> 37:54.873
Yeah, yeah, uh, just one sec.
One second.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.575
Be right back.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.276
Hey, Dwayne?

37:59.545 --> 38:01.046
Well, I thought you'd be off

38:01.079 --> 38:02.914
celebrating your grand opening.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.451
You let it get
awfully close there, Douglas.

38:05.484 --> 38:08.053
I saved your life, nonetheless.

38:08.086 --> 38:10.556
You could say that.

38:10.589 --> 38:13.325
Where's the video?

38:13.359 --> 38:14.526
It's safe.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.727
Mm.

38:15.761 --> 38:18.296
Well, I want it destroyed,
Dwayne.

38:20.366 --> 38:23.535
Happy Mardi Gras, Mr. Mayor.

38:23.569 --> 38:25.571
You, too.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.444
LASALLE:
Ms. Bujei?

38:32.478 --> 38:34.112
That is a very pretty necklace.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.782
Is it a gift from
your husband?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.083
Why do I get
the feeling you already

38:38.116 --> 38:39.685
know the answer
to that question?

38:39.718 --> 38:41.520
Tom, what is going on here?

38:41.553 --> 38:43.789
These officers want
to ask him some questions

38:43.822 --> 38:46.392
about the murder
of Patricia Spar.

38:51.162 --> 38:55.601
* Moving up higher
and higher and I know *

38:57.436 --> 39:00.872
* That God is watching us...

39:05.143 --> 39:07.579
Hey, everybody,
look who we found!

39:07.613 --> 39:08.714
Dad!

39:08.747 --> 39:10.416
WADE:
Well...

39:10.449 --> 39:12.751
uh, he was

39:12.784 --> 39:14.686
a little worried about you.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.823
As was I.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.157
Thanks for finding me, boo.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.859
Hey, Patton!

39:20.892 --> 39:23.662
My man, my man!

39:23.695 --> 39:25.096
Yeah, hey...

39:25.130 --> 39:27.165
we have been
saving this for you, man.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.067
"We"? I.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.737
He couldn't keep
his hands off this thing.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.071
LASALLE:
Triple teaming.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.773
Come on, man.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.174
Is that right?

39:36.207 --> 39:37.709
Whoever gets the baby

39:37.743 --> 39:39.945
has health and prosperity

39:39.978 --> 39:41.447
for the next year.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.583
All right, well,
it sounds good to me.

39:44.616 --> 39:47.185
I'm in.
