WEBVTT

00:05.714 --> 00:08.000
Gain your father's approval
to dissolve your marriage

00:08.175 --> 00:12.214
and find me as wet with desire
as you now stand.

00:12.387 --> 00:15.515
Albinius: News of your desires
towards loving daughter lifts heart.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.547
Remove encumbrance
as discussed.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.637
Lucretia: You would see your child
never born?

00:19.811 --> 00:21.062
llithyia: A necessary thing.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.561
Lucretia: There's a red vial.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.222
I would see its contents
replaced with water and bitter herb.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.265
Your wife's slave
stealing through the night,

00:27.444 --> 00:29.730
in her hand
a thing familiar to me.

00:29.905 --> 00:33.238
I know what I hold
and the intent it carries!

00:33.408 --> 00:36.445
Let these men not fall here tonight
but in the arena.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.202
We are for the arena
in Capua.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.739
Varinius:
I give you Gannicus!

00:41.917 --> 00:43.578
Gannicus: We at last face each other
upon the sands

00:43.752 --> 00:45.253
as Melitta always feared.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.956
- Did you lay with her?
- Oenomaus.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.298
Spartacus: We will cover
this land in ash and blood

00:52.469 --> 00:55.632
until Rome falls as a cinder
to scorched ground.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.426
Spartacus.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.682
Gaius, where is my father?

01:00.852 --> 01:01.887
Help me, please.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.099
Glaber: He has fallen at the hands
of Spartacus.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.308
(theme music playing )

01:17.160 --> 01:18.536
They live!

01:18.704 --> 01:21.036
( crowd chattering )

01:22.708 --> 01:24.198
- Woman: Get the medicus.
- Man: Quickly.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.116
Get water and cloth
to tend wounds.

01:26.295 --> 01:29.287
- What news?
- The arena is burned to fucking ground,

01:29.464 --> 01:31.455
with many Romans
among the ashes!

01:32.843 --> 01:34.049
What of Rhaskos?

01:34.219 --> 01:35.800
He fell as all men should.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.962
With sword in hand
and blood upon his thoughts.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.755
( crowd cheers )

01:39.933 --> 01:41.924
Nasir:
You suffer no wound.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.764
The gods favor me,
little man.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.850
Call me that again
and they shall turn from you.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.481
Can he be healed?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.157
Nasir had but a single wound.

01:56.325 --> 01:59.283
This man-- beyond what should
warrant life.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.115
His name is Oenomaus
and he is more than common man.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.247
Let's pray the gods
hold him in equal esteem.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.233
Do | yet dream?

02:38.784 --> 02:40.649
If so,

02:40.827 --> 02:42.442
I would never
have you wake.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.538
Then it began to collapse.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.627
They screamed
and flailed like children

02:56.802 --> 02:58.884
as the arena burned
around them,

02:59.054 --> 03:01.386
the scent of smoke and death

03:01.556 --> 03:05.048
carried by the winds
to the very heart of Rome!

03:08.730 --> 03:10.561
Spartacus:
Lift troubled heart.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.225
Oenomaus stands a titan,

03:14.403 --> 03:16.610
one that shall live
to raise sword again.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.941
To fight by your side?

03:20.409 --> 03:22.400
If he chooses to take up cause
against the Romans.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.704
Cause?

03:24.871 --> 03:27.453
You have cock to rival
Jupiter himself.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.910
A few errant slaves
amounts to

03:30.085 --> 03:32.121
flies circling a bull's ass.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.833
Did he miss the part where we pulled
the arena down on his head?

03:36.007 --> 03:38.919
Rome is propped up by more
than a few wooden beams.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.631
If your cause is
to see your lives cut short,

03:41.805 --> 03:44.421
you march towards
certain victory.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.591
Why did you choose to aid us,
if you believe such?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.931
You mistake choice

03:51.106 --> 03:53.062
for repayment of a debt,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.098
one owed to Oenomaus.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.768
Absent it,

03:57.946 --> 04:00.528
we would not be
breaking words.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.700
He is right.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.407
We were mistaken--

04:07.581 --> 04:09.697
to have placed faith
in his intentions.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.831
Nasir once made attempt
on my life,

04:12.002 --> 04:14.414
and yet now he stands
trusted among us.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.334
Perhaps Gannicus
can be swayed as well.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.676
Or perhaps you should have
killed him in the arena.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.346
Man: The witnesses in Rome
also attest

04:30.520 --> 04:33.387
the will grants
the family domicile in Rome

04:33.565 --> 04:36.523
and the villa here in Capua.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.234
In addition, there is
the vineyard in Atella,

04:40.405 --> 04:43.738
40 goats in the hills
of Pompeii,

04:43.909 --> 04:45.274
20 head of cattle--

04:45.452 --> 04:47.534
What is the worth
of the livestock?

04:49.247 --> 04:52.739
9,000 denarii,
depending upon deal struck.

04:52.918 --> 04:53.998
See them to market.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.160
And post decree
announcing reward of the coin

04:56.338 --> 04:58.454
for knowledge leading
to the capture of Spartacus.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.169
Forgive me, Praetor,

05:01.343 --> 05:04.551
but the law grants you
no such authority

05:04.721 --> 05:06.632
to part with these assets.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.720
You are only to oversee
Senator Albinius's holdings

05:10.894 --> 05:13.260
until his heir comes of age.

05:13.438 --> 05:17.306
Glaber: Laws must bend
toward greater purpose.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.066
Spartacus is to pay
for what he has done.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.023
- Praetor--
- Prattling on serves only

05:22.197 --> 05:25.064
to inflict further wound
on grieving heart.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.107
Man: Apologies.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.947
The memory of your father
shall not soon fade.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.783
All the Republic mourns his loss.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.282
Leave us.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.419
What moves your tears
the most--

05:43.593 --> 05:48.007
a father forever removed
from loving embrace

05:48.181 --> 05:49.887
or his tongue forever stilled

05:50.058 --> 05:51.889
before commanding
to dissolve this marriage

05:52.060 --> 05:53.891
in favor of Varinius?

05:56.147 --> 05:59.605
l have made a grave mistake.

05:59.776 --> 06:03.644
And the gods have punished me
by striking down my father.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.488
It is not enough.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.899
- Gaius.
- The only reason

06:09.077 --> 06:10.783
you have notjoined
your father

06:10.954 --> 06:13.570
is the child that grows
within you--

06:13.748 --> 06:15.784
my child, my heir.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.954
Protect him with your life...

06:20.213 --> 06:21.714
or see it forfeit.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.915
Man:
Workers, to the stockade!

06:25.093 --> 06:27.084
Man #2:
Open the gate!

06:27.262 --> 06:30.425
We must keep appearance

06:30.599 --> 06:33.716
of mourning
for the prescribed days.

06:37.022 --> 06:40.230
I would not have the stench of grief
slick upon you.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.607
See yourself to a bath.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.622
Give report.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.213
100 more bodies
pulled from the arena.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.673
This was found at wreckage.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.475
Why do our numbers
stand so few?

07:17.646 --> 07:20.137
Guard: More have been recalled
from Neapolis, to return by nightfall.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.148
Yet many have taken to the wind.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.730
They turn from their oath
to Rome?

07:25.904 --> 07:28.520
Fear and panic grip the region,
and our men.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.986
Many believe that Spartacus
unleashes the wrath of the gods.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.526
Ashur:
A meaningless thing.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.569
Legions could return
to swell rank

07:36.748 --> 07:38.454
yet still fail to Spartacus

07:38.625 --> 07:40.786
and his men.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.452
Apologies, but as I warned
young Marcus

07:44.631 --> 07:46.713
before life fled,

07:46.883 --> 07:49.670
gladiators are far from
common slaves.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.836
You'll not recall Spartacus facing
a clutch of your men

07:53.014 --> 07:54.879
for exhibition in this very villa

07:55.058 --> 07:57.674
and the result of such contest?

07:57.852 --> 07:59.513
Not all fight as Spartacus.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.770
Yet many are
of the Brotherhood.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.516
Three of your men would not equal
one so trained...

08:06.695 --> 08:07.855
( clears throat )

08:08.029 --> 08:10.190
...despite their
eagerness to die.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.197
No.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.734
Did you not once stand

08:15.912 --> 08:18.824
amongst the brotherhood...
(snaps fingers)

08:18.999 --> 08:20.864
upon the sands?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.541
A lifetime ago.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.212
Glaber: Then give lesson,

08:28.383 --> 08:30.374
prove boast.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.883
Praeto r, |--

08:32.053 --> 08:35.045
Be quick.
I would not linger in this heat.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.605
Man: The Syrian wants to taste
his own blood.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.155
(men laughing)

08:51.322 --> 08:53.404
Man:
The Syrian shit.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.065
Get in there, come on.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.404
( men jeering )

09:02.250 --> 09:04.536
- Man: What's the matter?
- Come on!

09:04.711 --> 09:05.700
Begin!

09:15.305 --> 09:16.294
Come on.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.205
Get him!

10:41.182 --> 10:43.639
And lwas considered lowest

10:43.810 --> 10:46.176
among the brotherhood.

10:46.354 --> 10:50.017
Would that I had an army
formed in your base image.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.524
There are others
that share my reflection--

10:53.695 --> 10:54.935
men in name only,

10:55.113 --> 10:58.697
a word masking truer nature
of rabid animal.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.734
Such a force
under my guidance

11:01.911 --> 11:04.823
could prove useful
in these difficult times.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.705
The Senate would frown upon
lowering standard

11:07.876 --> 11:09.412
into muck and shit...

11:10.879 --> 11:13.245
as they frown upon
many things

11:13.423 --> 11:16.381
that ambitious men
must embrace.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.141
Lucretia:
You leave these walls?

11:37.572 --> 11:40.484
( sighs )
At request of the praetor.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.234
He blesses Ashur

11:44.412 --> 11:46.949
with well-deserved favor.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.988
Would that he turn
such grace

11:49.167 --> 11:51.158
toward grieving wife.

11:52.754 --> 11:56.793
It is a hard thing to have father
torn from breast.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.633
I never knew mine.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.598
Though I often wondered--

12:07.769 --> 12:11.307
How did Glaber come to know
of the silphium in llithyia's chambers?

12:11.481 --> 12:14.393
Perhaps the gods spoke to him.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.229
You forget your place.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.939
No, l secure it.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.107
You secure nothing
without me,

12:24.285 --> 12:26.401
you fucking Syrian.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.620
Move against
my commands again--

12:30.917 --> 12:33.408
You command shit and piss.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.622
I am Glaber's man now.

12:35.797 --> 12:39.540
A word from me how you knew
of his wife's intent

12:39.717 --> 12:42.880
to rob him
of his unborn child

12:43.054 --> 12:45.545
or how the gods
had nothing to do

12:45.723 --> 12:47.304
with delivering Oenomaus--

12:50.812 --> 12:53.349
You yet draw breath

12:53.523 --> 12:57.857
because I have not whispered
your secrets into the praetor's ear.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.688
No, Ashur. Ashur.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.194
Shh. Consider it a kindness,

13:02.365 --> 13:04.947
one that I shall see repaid.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.076
( Lucretia sobbing )

13:15.837 --> 13:17.668
No.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.331
Does it hurt?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.918
A few cuts and scrapes,

13:25.096 --> 13:27.303
soon faded from memory.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.851
Would that all scars
were so easily erased.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.305
| see no scars.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.699
You risked all

13:48.870 --> 13:52.362
for pale shadow of the woman
you once loved.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.282
Then let us ignite the sun

13:55.460 --> 13:59.669
and strike darkness
with its warmth.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.677
Stop.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.352
Naevia.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.354
They have taken everything
from me...

15:03.236 --> 15:05.568
even your touch.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.969
l have heard tales
of your victories in the arena.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.347
Days long past.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.806
Mira tells you were
just upon its sands,

15:38.980 --> 15:41.471
standing as executioner
for the Romans.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.935
I stood for a brother,

15:44.110 --> 15:46.647
to see him
to an honorable death.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.108
And Rhaskos?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.865
Did he find the same?

15:54.996 --> 15:57.112
The man held
some meaning to you?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.491
He elevated position.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.001
I gave comfort.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.674
It appears that bargain
has come to an end.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.508
I would see another struck

16:15.683 --> 16:17.844
with a man of greater worth.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.010
I hold no position
among these men,

16:20.188 --> 16:22.224
nor do I seek it.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.556
Yet you stand among them.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.693
I seek only words
with an old friend,

16:28.863 --> 16:30.694
nothing more.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.048
We are here,
in the shadow of Vesuvius.

16:55.223 --> 16:57.339
A single man
placed upon its crest

16:57.517 --> 17:00.008
would have clear view
for many miles in all direction.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.892
A Roman advance
easily spotted.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.519
Is there a way
to its peak?

17:03.689 --> 17:06.852
A single path,
narrow, but easily tread.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.893
The rest is sheer rock,
impassable, absent wings.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.396
We will choose three men

17:13.574 --> 17:15.485
of years beyond
the taking up of sword,

17:15.660 --> 17:17.651
each to command
a separate watch.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.534
Mira: There's but one entrance
to the temple.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.696
The Romans could
easily trap us inside.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.910
Spartacus: Tunnels extend
below our feet.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.916
Perhaps one can be dug
beyond these walls.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.169
A few men with bows
would give the Romans pause

17:28.339 --> 17:30.751
long enough to make use of it,
if walkway were built.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.917
How many among you
shoot with purpose?

17:35.137 --> 17:37.298
There is not much call
for arrows in the arena.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.589
You no longer fight
upon the sands,

17:39.767 --> 17:42.429
nor can you forge a sword
from a fucking tree.

17:42.603 --> 17:46.346
Then we will fashion weapons
from what nature provides,

17:46.524 --> 17:49.231
with practiced hand
instructing in their use.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.438
We can train
until the gods take us.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.819
House slaves
will never be gladiators--

17:53.990 --> 17:56.026
something we are
in short supply of now.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.031
We need fighting men.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.120
Perhaps it is time to revisit plans
towards Neapolis

18:07.295 --> 18:09.581
and its slaver ships
from foreign wars.

18:09.755 --> 18:13.293
You would attack the port
with a few men?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.594
We brought the arena down
with less.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.628
Take two men
and what coin we have.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.262
Weight palm in Neapolis

18:20.433 --> 18:23.766
to loosen tongue
of ships soon to dock.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.597
Do it quietly.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.262
I would not have
intention known.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.814
Apologies. I did not intend
to halt conversation.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.824
Unless I can drink that,
it holds no worth to me.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.825
I seek only wine.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.987
We have none.

18:44.165 --> 18:46.747
Then I truly am
among the damned.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.128
For both of you?

18:53.299 --> 18:56.006
( laughs) I'm a whore,
not a fool.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.917
- ( man shouts)
- ( woman screams )

19:26.040 --> 19:28.076
I would have words.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.831
Fuck your words.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.867
( chuckles )

19:32.046 --> 19:34.708
It is not with you
that I seek them.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.281
l have an offer to discuss,

20:02.451 --> 20:06.239
one suited
to your particular talents.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.073
( insects chirping )

20:22.096 --> 20:24.052
Apologies.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.964
I did not think
you would need the bath,

20:27.143 --> 20:28.929
with days of mourning
yet left.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.936
My husband commands it,

20:32.106 --> 20:34.097
despite tradition.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.225
Stay.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.112
I would have your company.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.131
Your eyes betray recent tears.

21:01.302 --> 21:04.169
Events weigh heavy
on the heart.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.053
To the point of crushing it.

21:08.184 --> 21:11.142
Why did the gods not warn
of Spartacus's attack

21:11.312 --> 21:13.348
or of my father's--?

21:14.732 --> 21:16.768
Do they punish me--

21:18.569 --> 21:21.936
a life, for the one
I had planned to take?

21:22.114 --> 21:25.481
We both carry
the burden of our acts.

21:31.874 --> 21:35.492
If the gods
have cast us adrift,

21:35.669 --> 21:38.160
we must together
discover the course

21:38.339 --> 21:40.876
for return to the blessings
of their shores.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.542
Varinius has turned from me.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.676
Gaius-- I fear
not even the gods

21:46.847 --> 21:48.929
could sway
his hatred of me now.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.681
Resume appearance
of loving wife.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.139
Submit to his will.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.605
The day will come
when he will lose sight

21:58.776 --> 22:00.983
of hateful intention--

22:01.153 --> 22:03.895
a slip, however fleeting,

22:04.073 --> 22:07.031
that we shall
take advantage of.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.628
There was a time...

22:23.217 --> 22:27.176
when all I dreamt of was
your throat beneath my hands.

22:32.393 --> 22:36.136
Now your breath
is all that gives me life.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.229
I shall not be moved
from your side

22:42.403 --> 22:45.941
until my own husband
calls me to the afterlife.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.198
( men chattering )

22:59.211 --> 23:01.247
l have seen that look.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.083
It often fell upon me,

23:03.257 --> 23:05.339
when we were yet
beneath Batiatus's roof.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.249
Spartacus:
You knew Gannicus then,

23:07.428 --> 23:09.419
years before my arrival.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.263
What is your opinion
of the man?

23:13.434 --> 23:17.268
He is a champion,
as we once stood,

23:17.438 --> 23:19.099
a boon to your cause.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.605
He has expressed doubts
toward it.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.985
As have we all.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.773
Yet you always find way
to convince otherwise.

23:38.459 --> 23:41.075
We have done
the impossible.

23:42.630 --> 23:46.168
We have brought down
the arena in Capua--

23:46.342 --> 23:48.082
a monument of Rome

23:48.260 --> 23:51.377
built upon
the backs of slaves.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.092
We have struck a deep blow

23:54.266 --> 23:56.973
to the very heart of our enemy.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.601
Yet...

23:59.772 --> 24:02.639
their numbers are vast,

24:02.816 --> 24:05.068
as vast as their desire
to see freedom

24:05.235 --> 24:07.396
crushed beneath heel.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.653
One day,

24:09.823 --> 24:13.816
perhaps soon,
they will strike back.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.370
How do we avoid them?

24:15.537 --> 24:17.152
I do not intend to.

24:17.331 --> 24:18.696
Is that true?

24:18.874 --> 24:21.786
Spartacus: If we are to face
the might of Rome,

24:21.961 --> 24:23.917
I would do it here,

24:24.088 --> 24:25.794
in the shadow of Vesuvius,

24:25.965 --> 24:28.547
upon terms that we set.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.880
No hand will stand idle.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.921
We must prepare ourselves
for what is to come.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.090
- Well, what is to come?
- What is to happen to us?

24:37.267 --> 24:39.553
Proper weapons
are in short supply.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.310
Fashion what you can
from wood and stone

24:42.481 --> 24:45.268
till more can be secured.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.694
I would also see
the tunnels beneath our feet

24:47.861 --> 24:50.603
further dug towards escape,
which we will need...

24:50.781 --> 24:53.864
To set eyes again
upon your heart--

24:54.034 --> 24:57.947
I understand now why a man
would risk all for such a thing.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.947
If it were not for you
and the others,

25:01.125 --> 25:03.081
I would have fallen
in the arena,

25:03.252 --> 25:05.868
never to gaze upon her face again
in this life.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.788
It is a thing I will not forget.

25:08.966 --> 25:11.378
- Spartacus: Continue to hone skill.
- Nor the lie you told

25:11.552 --> 25:14.544
that saw her stay in that place
another fucking day.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.553
She is safe now.

25:20.728 --> 25:23.595
All other things
fall to unimportance.

25:23.772 --> 25:27.060
Do you think a few words
can change all that has happened?

25:27.234 --> 25:29.099
You stand a larger fool
than I thought.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.189
...than a thousand men.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.570
Apologies.

25:33.741 --> 25:36.323
The mistake was mine,

25:36.493 --> 25:39.030
to offer comfort
to a fucking Gaul.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.492
You offer shit.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.075
- Regain yourself.
- Crixus.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.581
I thought we had moved
past this.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.296
Wounds still linger.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.259
I move for Neapolis

25:59.433 --> 26:02.015
and thoughts of swelling rank
with better men.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.268
(Gannicus laughing)

26:04.438 --> 26:06.349
You need not fear
the Romans.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.935
Your own men make attempt
to kill each other.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.776
You know what must be done.
See to it.

26:14.782 --> 26:17.023
Gannicus,

26:17.201 --> 26:18.782
I would have words.

26:20.454 --> 26:22.319
You would have me fight?

26:22.498 --> 26:24.238
lwould have you hunt.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.327
Everyone has been set
to purpose.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.709
Ours is to provide meat.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.636
You spoke of a debt
to Oenomaus.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.465
Was saving his life
not repayment enough?

26:43.644 --> 26:45.600
That is for him to decide.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.513
You are a free man.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.147
Your decision's your own,

26:51.318 --> 26:52.979
as they were
when you stood in the arena

26:53.153 --> 26:55.144
to strike down your brothers.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.813
What moved your hand?

26:57.991 --> 26:59.856
Honor, as you would have it,

27:00.035 --> 27:01.616
or the promise of coin?

27:01.787 --> 27:03.778
Never to be collected,

27:03.956 --> 27:06.993
because I chose
not to kill you in the arena.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.500
And now my rudis--
my freedom--

27:10.671 --> 27:12.252
is forever buried
beneath its rubble.

27:12.422 --> 27:15.585
Freedom is not
a stick of wood

27:15.759 --> 27:17.920
to be presented as bone
to obedient dog.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.006
It is a thing all men deserve.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.341
We are gladiators,

27:22.516 --> 27:25.553
deserving only death
equal to the lives that we have taken.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.859
It was not always so for me.

27:36.947 --> 27:39.279
I lived free once

27:39.449 --> 27:42.577
in the lands of Thrace

27:42.744 --> 27:44.655
with a wife,

27:44.830 --> 27:47.537
promise of children.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.040
What became of her?

27:50.210 --> 27:52.622
Batiatus claimed her life.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.497
I took his in return.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.756
Then you have balanced scale.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.172
It was Glaber
who condemned us to slavery.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.432
And lwill not rest

28:07.603 --> 28:09.013
while he yet draws breath.

28:09.188 --> 28:13.227
This is the reason
you provoke the Romans--

28:13.400 --> 28:15.231
for the memory
of your woman?

28:15.402 --> 28:17.814
For love--

28:20.866 --> 28:23.323
the greatest cause of all.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.786
A thing that has dragged
many a man to ruin.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.161
You have scared away
the game.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.710
I would fare better alone.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.027
Man:
Keep fucking sword up.

29:09.206 --> 29:12.164
Let it drop,
and fall forever beside it.

29:12.334 --> 29:13.824
Again.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.968
Attack.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.632
I would not have you expire
from the heat.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.639
Donar: Attack.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.425
Gratitude.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.437
I would also not have you
at Agron's throat.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.472
Donar: Again.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.516
If he had had his way,

29:39.695 --> 29:41.435
he would have
left you in the mines.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.319
Perhaps he was right.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.776
Do not say such a thing.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.283
Have you not thought the same

29:48.453 --> 29:49.989
after last night?

29:50.163 --> 29:52.154
If such a thought
threatened,

29:52.332 --> 29:55.574
lwould rip it from fucking brain
with bare hands.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.868
All that matters

29:58.046 --> 30:00.298
is the woman I love

30:00.465 --> 30:02.547
stands before me once again.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.800
Does she?

30:06.305 --> 30:08.546
Or is it but faint spirit

30:08.724 --> 30:11.557
haunting the memory
ofherbody?

30:18.942 --> 30:20.898
You have lost mind.

30:21.069 --> 30:24.778
Hundreds dead, an arena destroyed,
and this is what you offer?

30:24.948 --> 30:28.361
Lucretia to prostrate herself
in the market,

30:28.535 --> 30:31.868
begging the gods to piss out
the flames that yet smolder?

30:32.039 --> 30:33.700
Apologies.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.866
Young Seppius is but moved
by passionate heart.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.625
Glaber:
I'm sure the gods take notice

30:38.795 --> 30:40.205
of his lack of faith.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.793
Lucretia: We must humble ourselves
before the gods

30:43.967 --> 30:46.379
in attempt to regain
their favor.

30:46.553 --> 30:49.386
Glaber: Ritual will do much
to ease the people's fears.

30:49.556 --> 30:52.389
Seppius: Better assuaged
by the capture of Spartacus.

30:52.559 --> 30:56.802
My men sweep the countryside,
taking action in favor of prayer.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.720
As they have for months,
to no result.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.140
Yours have fared no better.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.734
True.

31:05.739 --> 31:08.355
The only one who benefits
from our divide

31:08.533 --> 31:11.195
is the man
who causes us injury.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.281
And most keenly felt.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.413
Your father's guidance
and even hand

31:17.584 --> 31:19.245
is deeply missed.

31:19.419 --> 31:22.206
His absence
from this world

31:22.381 --> 31:24.997
has set it upon end.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.932
Seppia fell to similar heart

31:33.100 --> 31:37.093
when our cousin Sextus
was snatched from life by Spartacus.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.888
And she relives the moment
in Mercato's passing--

31:41.066 --> 31:44.934
a family friend
since she was yet a child.

31:45.112 --> 31:47.068
Glaber:
Too many have been lost.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.447
I would see no more of note
to follow.

31:50.617 --> 31:54.405
Let us set difference aside,

31:54.579 --> 31:56.615
join our men
in common force,

31:56.790 --> 32:00.533
one which will overwhelm Spartacus
and his murdering horde.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.917
Yes, for the good of the people.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.794
The city will praise you both,

32:04.965 --> 32:08.173
our voices carrying
to the very steps of the Senate.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.634
I would need to consult
with Varinius.

32:11.805 --> 32:13.761
The very same man
who galloped back to Rome

32:13.932 --> 32:16.298
while the stones of the arena
were yet falling?

32:16.476 --> 32:19.684
Varinius moves
to distance himself

32:19.855 --> 32:22.688
from all that has happened here,
including you.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.818
Take my hand

32:28.989 --> 32:33.608
and with it
see more lasting bond forged.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.452
I will consider your proposal,

32:41.626 --> 32:44.083
to give answer tomorrow.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.665
Gallienus:
A night's rest--

32:46.840 --> 32:49.752
Loving sister may sway a brother
where others fail.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.383
Gallienus: --mind to be certainly
cleared by morning.

32:52.554 --> 32:56.012
Seppius,

32:56.183 --> 32:59.721
I would extend invitation
to your sister

32:59.895 --> 33:02.352
in hopes that we may find
greater strength

33:02.522 --> 33:04.604
in the beating
of two wounded hearts.

33:04.774 --> 33:07.481
Gallien us:
A thoughtful offer.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.813
There is no deeper solace
for a woman

33:09.988 --> 33:12.570
than in the bosom
ofhergenden

33:13.658 --> 33:15.819
It would come
as great comfort.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.819
Gratitude.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.033
I will arrange visit.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.664
Your wife speaks
with swift thought.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.875
Seppia will take words
to heart on the matter,

33:30.050 --> 33:33.793
with Seppius to find them
better received from her lips.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.006
Yes.

33:36.181 --> 33:40.424
Your invitation may yet prove
to be welcome aid.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.181
Come.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.346
I would discuss
other matters with you.

33:51.905 --> 33:54.066
Did I not tell you?

33:55.158 --> 33:57.023
Together...

33:57.202 --> 34:00.660
we will see ourselves freed
from this abyss.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.917
( crows cawing )

34:08.088 --> 34:10.249
I do not see the man.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.250
You are certain he lives?

34:15.428 --> 34:17.760
There were four others
held with him at the bottom.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.092
He did not care
for the company.

34:20.267 --> 34:23.509
Their memory is carved
into his flesh,

34:23.687 --> 34:26.724
joining the marks of the other souls
that he has taken.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.104
( laughs)

34:28.275 --> 34:30.482
What is it you seek
of such a beast?

34:30.652 --> 34:34.440
What I seek of the Egyptian
is none of your concern.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.781
I come under the authority

34:38.952 --> 34:42.410
of Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.537
A noble title.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.451
Yet absent the man himself,

34:48.628 --> 34:51.005
I cannot break my charge.

34:52.007 --> 34:54.293
Of course.

34:54.467 --> 34:58.335
If you do not mind
waiting here with my men,

34:58.513 --> 35:01.755
until I return with him...

35:03.518 --> 35:05.725
Well, the day has been
long and hot.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.477
I would have shade

35:08.648 --> 35:11.515
and wine

35:11.693 --> 35:15.311
to cool overheating concerns.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.335
Let us see you to the light,
my friend...

35:31.046 --> 35:33.583
and set hands to purpose.

35:45.935 --> 35:48.972
(Mira chuckles)

35:49.147 --> 35:52.139
You must keep
your left arm steady,

35:52.317 --> 35:54.353
pull through to the cheek,

35:54.527 --> 35:56.688
take breath and release.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.197
Make attempt.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.826
Pull through to cheek,

36:04.996 --> 36:07.157
deep breath

36:07.332 --> 36:08.993
and release.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.664
Do not jerk from the string

36:17.842 --> 36:21.255
but let it gently slip
from your fingers.

36:21.429 --> 36:25.217
With practice, you will be
as the goddess Diana,

36:25.392 --> 36:28.179
striking enemies from afar.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.059
Donan

36:30.230 --> 36:32.016
I would accompany you.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.146
I hold no interest in the bow.

36:34.317 --> 36:37.809
We lay together once
and you expect us to never be parted?

36:38.905 --> 36:41.317
You mistake me
for a fucking Gaul.

36:48.748 --> 36:51.410
You seek
Donar's affection now?

36:51.584 --> 36:54.542
I seek only my place
in this world.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.749
Then seize it
with your own hands,

36:57.924 --> 37:00.415
not by the spreading
of your legs.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.005
In two weeks time
a ship will dock here,

37:07.183 --> 37:09.925
its hold laden with fighting men
captured by the Romans.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.843
If a few of us
dressed as merchants

37:12.021 --> 37:13.557
could gain entry
before they're unloaded--

37:13.732 --> 37:15.563
Such a thing is possible.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.565
Your labors have born fruit.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.226
Not all is sweet.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.690
News carries
through the streets--

37:21.865 --> 37:25.153
Glaber has raised the bounty
on your head to 9,000 denarii.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.616
It seems you have caught
nothing but Rome's attention.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.281
You will find that a sour meal.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.451
( laughs)

37:37.547 --> 37:39.378
Were the Gauls
not fucking bad enough?

37:44.429 --> 37:47.592
l have heard many tales
of the Undefeated Gaul.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.142
A fine title.

37:55.398 --> 37:58.640
Yet I recall you
absent victory

37:58.818 --> 38:02.356
when we faced Solonius's men
in the opening of the arena.

38:04.157 --> 38:07.991
True.
I was not awarded victory.

38:08.161 --> 38:11.119
Yet I did not suffer defeat
in proper challenge.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.655
( chuckles )

38:13.833 --> 38:16.540
Perhaps we will yet have one.

38:17.837 --> 38:18.872
Perhaps.

38:19.047 --> 38:22.255
lt warms heart
to know that you were champion,

38:22.425 --> 38:24.666
how much you desired it.

38:24.844 --> 38:28.587
Yet it comes as a surprise

38:28.765 --> 38:32.178
to see you here,
following a Thracian's lead.

38:32.352 --> 38:35.344
Spartacus has opened my eyes.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.638
We stand together.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.977
Then why do you now sit

38:40.151 --> 38:43.143
while he and the lumbering oaf
make plans that affect all?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.439
I am taken
by other concerns.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.285
Naevia is your woman now?

38:54.666 --> 38:58.534
I remember her when she was yet
a flower untouched.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.794
What led her
to be so rudely handled?

39:01.965 --> 39:04.456
My affections

39:04.634 --> 39:07.467
and discovery of them
by Lucretia.

39:07.637 --> 39:10.379
The heaviest price is always paid
by those we love.

39:10.557 --> 39:12.718
You should carry her
far from Spartacus

39:12.892 --> 39:14.928
and his foolish cause

39:15.103 --> 39:17.970
before he drags you all
to your end.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.399
Oenomaus awakes.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.157
lam here only for words.

39:44.674 --> 39:47.461
Which do you think

39:47.635 --> 39:49.500
could ever
hold meaning now?

39:49.679 --> 39:52.762
That Melitta chose you.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.889
That your heart was cherished
above all others.

39:58.062 --> 40:02.431
Then why was she with you
the night she died?

40:02.609 --> 40:06.898
To share a final drink
before I was to be sold to Tullius.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.942
The only reason?

40:13.578 --> 40:16.570
Whatever happened
between us,

40:16.748 --> 40:18.784
I am to blame,

40:18.958 --> 40:20.573
nothen

40:20.752 --> 40:22.617
never her.

40:25.048 --> 40:26.834
I loved you as a brother.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.088
And I you.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.124
No.

40:31.679 --> 40:36.389
You are a man
that stands only for himself

40:36.559 --> 40:38.800
and would betray the gods

40:38.978 --> 40:41.310
to gain what he desires.

40:44.651 --> 40:47.358
Perhaps I was a fool

40:47.528 --> 40:50.565
to have ever believed
otherwise.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.579
(Seppia crying )

41:03.753 --> 41:06.210
| see it every time
| close my eyes--

41:08.216 --> 41:11.174
Spartacus hurling his spear,

41:11.344 --> 41:15.212
Cossutius's final
gasping breath.

41:18.059 --> 41:20.015
And Mercato--

41:20.186 --> 41:21.847
poor Mercato.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.514
He will be sorely missed.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.228
Apologies.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.939
l babble on as if I am the only one
that has suffered loss,

41:30.113 --> 41:32.024
and you grieve
a father's passing.

41:32.198 --> 41:35.065
The heart is overwhelmed
by his absence.

41:35.243 --> 41:37.484
You shall embrace him again,

41:37.662 --> 41:39.323
as I shall Mercato

41:39.497 --> 41:41.237
and beloved cousin Sextus.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.582
Upon the shores of the afterlife,

41:44.752 --> 41:48.119
where my husband Quintus
patiently awaits.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.758
And with him

41:54.929 --> 41:57.466
countless other Romans of note,

41:57.640 --> 41:59.722
all snatched from this life
too soon

41:59.892 --> 42:01.883
by common foe.

42:07.233 --> 42:11.192
The years between you
far outweigh mine,

42:11.362 --> 42:13.739
yet do not think me naive.

42:13.906 --> 42:17.239
You extend invitation
not to counsel grief,

42:17.410 --> 42:20.152
but to maneuver me
to sway my brother's position.

42:20.329 --> 42:22.069
- Seppia.
- He's been clear in his desire

42:22.248 --> 42:23.829
that he, and he alone,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.742
will bring our common foe
to justice.

42:26.919 --> 42:30.047
And his passions, when set,
are not easily moved.

42:30.214 --> 42:33.547
You have uncovered
the veiled schemes of two old women.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.468
But know attempt springs
from wounded heart,

42:37.638 --> 42:41.631
one shared between us all,
regardless of age or experience.

42:45.229 --> 42:48.221
I looked into his eyes

42:48.399 --> 42:51.641
when Spartacus
stood down upon the sands.

42:51.819 --> 42:55.152
They burned with a fire
that would consume the world.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.860
Glaber: And it shall,

42:58.034 --> 43:00.741
if good men fail
to set quarrel aside

43:00.912 --> 43:02.402
and face Spartacus
as one.

43:02.580 --> 43:06.243
As l have said to your wife,
my brother can be most difficult.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.159
The fault is not his alone.

43:09.337 --> 43:12.545
I regret not having taken
different path

43:12.715 --> 43:15.707
towards more
agreeable solution.

43:15.885 --> 43:20.219
But know that | place foot
firmly upon it now.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.550
I will have words

43:25.728 --> 43:28.640
and attempt to set him upon it
beside you.

43:29.649 --> 43:32.686
Most welcome news,
is it not, Gaius?

43:32.860 --> 43:34.191
Yes.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.649
Most welcome.

43:39.117 --> 43:42.951
You are a ray of light
in a house mired in shadow.

43:48.334 --> 43:49.744
( footsteps )

43:49.919 --> 43:51.750
Ah, forgive me.

43:55.758 --> 43:58.716
Pressing matters
call my attention.

44:03.808 --> 44:06.174
You are blessed
to hold such a man.

44:06.352 --> 44:10.015
The gods grant
only what is deserved.

44:11.566 --> 44:14.558
The men required
have been assembled.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.864
Come then.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.647
I would see if they are
all that you've promised.

44:24.203 --> 44:27.195
( footsteps )

44:31.002 --> 44:33.584
Gannicus's bounty
is being prepared.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.372
Come, let us take food.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.804
You have honed it
to fine edge.

44:47.894 --> 44:49.885
Life would easily run
from veins,

44:50.062 --> 44:51.973
if brought to bear
upon flesh.

44:52.148 --> 44:53.388
Naevia.

44:53.566 --> 44:55.807
That is a name
that holds no meaning.

44:58.237 --> 45:02.025
She was a different girl,

45:02.200 --> 45:06.910
young and foolish,

45:07.079 --> 45:09.536
ripped from this world

45:09.707 --> 45:12.915
by rough hands
and hot breath upon neck.

45:16.088 --> 45:20.297
The things she was forced
to do to survive--

45:20.468 --> 45:23.301
We will go from this place,

45:23.471 --> 45:26.087
find a new life
on distant shores,

45:26.265 --> 45:28.301
beyond the shadow of Rome.

45:30.770 --> 45:34.262
There is no place
that memory would not follow.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.728
I cannot run from this.

45:48.788 --> 45:50.949
What would you have me do--

45:51.123 --> 45:54.661
stand idle
and watch as you fade?

45:54.835 --> 45:57.417
No, I would not
have you watch.

45:59.674 --> 46:02.916
I would have you teach

46:03.094 --> 46:04.959
how to breathe again,

46:05.137 --> 46:07.344
how to live,

46:07.515 --> 46:09.972
how to fight,

46:10.142 --> 46:13.680
so that no man will ever
lay hands on me

46:13.854 --> 46:16.436
against my will

46:16.607 --> 46:19.349
and the girl

46:19.527 --> 46:23.270
whose name was robbed
may reclaim it.

46:24.991 --> 46:27.198
We will have vengeance

46:27.368 --> 46:30.235
for what the Romans
have done.

46:31.247 --> 46:33.112
Together we shall
see them drown

46:33.291 --> 46:35.532
in rivers of blood.

46:35.710 --> 46:38.042
- ( men shouting )
-( loud crash )

46:38.212 --> 46:39.748
Man:
Where has it gone?

46:39.922 --> 46:42.004
- Nothing.
- Nor here.

46:42.174 --> 46:44.165
Spartacus:
Calm yourselves.

46:44.343 --> 46:46.379
What moves to such fits?

46:46.554 --> 46:48.795
Our remaining coin is missing.

46:48.973 --> 46:50.338
Fuck the coin.
The map is gone--

46:50.516 --> 46:52.632
our position,
plans towards Neapolis.

46:52.810 --> 46:56.223
Someone seeks to betray us
for promise of Glaber's reward.

46:56.397 --> 46:57.557
Spartacus.

46:58.733 --> 47:00.394
Gannicus.

47:00.568 --> 47:02.604
You leave without words?

47:02.778 --> 47:04.188
(thunder rumbling)

47:04.363 --> 47:05.944
l have had them
with Oenomaus.

47:06.115 --> 47:07.980
What do you carry
with you?

47:08.159 --> 47:09.399
Water.

47:09.577 --> 47:11.317
Meat caught by my own
fucking hands.

47:11.495 --> 47:12.905
Open it.

47:15.541 --> 47:17.532
lam not one of your fools,

47:17.710 --> 47:19.075
falling to command.

47:19.253 --> 47:20.959
Our map takes flight
in your wake.

47:21.130 --> 47:23.462
A thing I have seen
your gaze upon.

47:25.009 --> 47:27.421
lam guilty of many things.

47:27.595 --> 47:31.053
Betraying ill-fated cause
does not stand among them.

47:33.267 --> 47:35.849
Remove yourself
from fucking path.

47:41.067 --> 47:42.477
(thunder crashing )

47:46.614 --> 47:49.321
( laughs)

47:49.492 --> 47:52.609
I knew you would lead these men
to their deaths eventually.

47:52.787 --> 47:54.243
Is this the day
you would do it?

47:54.413 --> 47:56.529
They are but loyal--

47:57.792 --> 48:00.283
a quality you seem
unfamiliar with.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.799
No! Do not come
between us.

48:13.808 --> 48:16.174
I would show him
what a man with cause is capable of.

48:16.352 --> 48:18.388
Your sword.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.725
You fight in the style
of Dimachaerus.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.485
Trained by Oenomaus himself.

48:28.656 --> 48:30.146
Let me pass,

48:30.324 --> 48:32.656
or put skill to final test.

49:00.062 --> 49:01.438
We must stop this.

49:01.605 --> 49:03.687
Spartacus has made
his desire known.

49:03.858 --> 49:05.098
We shall honor it.

49:54.575 --> 49:56.691
Spartacus!

50:04.543 --> 50:07.159
( people exclaiming )

50:08.923 --> 50:11.255
Mira: She was trying to slip away
when all others stood fixed.

50:11.425 --> 50:12.835
A fine shot.

50:15.346 --> 50:17.337
I meant only to wound.

50:28.275 --> 50:30.436
She took the map.

50:32.404 --> 50:35.020
Why would she do
such a thing?

50:36.033 --> 50:39.070
Mira: She felt she had
no place among us.

50:39.245 --> 50:41.406
She sought to secure one
elsewhere.

50:50.965 --> 50:52.830
Apologies.

50:53.008 --> 50:54.794
Your words prove true.

50:54.969 --> 50:57.381
It has not always been so.

50:59.807 --> 51:02.799
I would take to path now,

51:02.977 --> 51:05.593
unless you would seek
further quarrel.

51:06.605 --> 51:09.563
Go. Enough blood
has been spilled.

51:20.828 --> 51:22.318
Do you stay?

51:23.747 --> 51:25.248
We do.

51:26.584 --> 51:28.575
Then I shall mourn
your passing.

51:33.507 --> 51:35.543
Is it wise to let him go?

51:37.177 --> 51:40.669
Every man has a right
to his own choice.

51:40.848 --> 51:42.304
Gannicus has made his.

51:42.474 --> 51:44.760
And may yet prove a threat.

51:48.147 --> 51:50.183
We have faced far worse.

51:51.233 --> 51:53.098
( screams )

52:44.953 --> 52:48.320
The Egyptian and your men
prove themselves.

52:48.499 --> 52:50.581
As promised.

52:52.211 --> 52:55.203
See the bodies of the slaves
properly attended.

52:55.381 --> 52:56.996
Draw no attention.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.970
Apologies.

53:13.148 --> 53:14.729
I could not wait
till morning.

53:14.900 --> 53:15.935
( moans)

53:16.110 --> 53:18.772
You wish to give voice
to my offer?

53:19.947 --> 53:21.312
I fear it comes too late.

53:21.490 --> 53:23.731
S-S-Seppia.

53:23.909 --> 53:27.948
I've seen how close
you hold her to heart.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.201
Leave this life
knowing she's safe

53:35.379 --> 53:38.041
beneath my roof,

53:38.215 --> 53:42.049
my hands to comfort her
in days to come.

53:43.470 --> 53:46.303
Words no longer hold meaning.

53:47.516 --> 53:49.598
And I've had too many of them
by fools

53:49.768 --> 53:51.929
presuming themselves
to be my better.

53:52.104 --> 53:53.969
Such days are at an end.

53:56.525 --> 53:58.481
Your men are now mine

53:58.652 --> 54:02.361
and, with their addition
to my own,

54:02.531 --> 54:04.396
clear path to the end

54:04.575 --> 54:06.566
of Spartacus.

54:32.519 --> 54:34.680
(theme music playing )
