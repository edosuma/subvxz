WEBVTT

00:05.006 --> 00:06.966
Ain't no party like
a cupcake party

00:07.049 --> 00:08.592
'cause a cupcake party starts

00:08.676 --> 00:09.719
Wednesdays at eight.

00:09.802 --> 00:10.845
Clash of the Cupcakes,

00:10.928 --> 00:12.680
only on Food TV.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.349
Cut. All right,
Dev, a few more promos left.

00:15.433 --> 00:18.144
For these next ones, let's
do it with a little moxie.

00:18.227 --> 00:20.604
Like, you know, put
some energy in it.

00:20.730 --> 00:23.065
Sure, Lawrence.
More moxie.

00:23.149 --> 00:24.150
Okay.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.527
Ask not what your
cupcakes can do for you.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.487
Ask what you can do
for your cupcakes.

00:28.571 --> 00:30.448
Clash of the
Cupcakes is all new,

00:30.531 --> 00:32.825
Wednesdays at eight,
only on Food TV.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.785
Jesus, who wrote these?

00:34.869 --> 00:35.995
I did.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.163
Is there a problem?

00:37.246 --> 00:38.956
- No.
- Didn't think so.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.082
Just read the damn lines.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.500
PTSD warning:

00:41.584 --> 00:42.960
Pretty Tasty Sweet Delights.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.295
All right, we can't do that one.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.379
That's definitely offensive.

00:45.463 --> 00:48.049
Excuse me for trying to do
something for the troops.

00:48.132 --> 00:49.258
We got, like, 20 more
to shoot anyway.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.053
We really need to relight.

00:52.136 --> 00:54.722
- Are the ones we did not usable?
- Nah.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.182
- Jeez.
- And Chef Jeff's here.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.767
- He wants to see you.
- Okay.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.102
Hey, Dev, you
got some crumbs here.

01:00.186 --> 01:01.353
Oh, thank you.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.565
Don't want those crumbs
showing up in HD.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.486
God, you know, you
have really nice skin.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.488
Just got this nice mocha glow.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.615
Mm, mocha glow? Thank you.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.617
I normally just get "brown."

01:14.700 --> 01:16.285
- All good? Thanks, guys.
- I'll see you.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.578
Hey, Jeff!

01:17.661 --> 01:18.704
What up, fam?

01:18.788 --> 01:19.747
- How are you?
- All right.

01:19.830 --> 01:20.748
Good to see you.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.416
Who the fuck is that?

01:22.500 --> 01:24.210
Oh, um, that's Lisa.
She does makeup.

01:24.293 --> 01:25.753
She is fine, man. Is she single?

01:25.836 --> 01:27.129
- I don't know.
- You need to ask her out.

01:27.213 --> 01:28.172
What the fuck you
doing talking to me?

01:28.255 --> 01:29.507
She is cute. I don't know if
that's in the cards, though.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.634
You're cray, okay? You
need to get with that.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.052
Okay, so...

01:33.135 --> 01:35.221
we are getting close to
the end of the season.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.807
So... wanted to check in with you.
How you feeling?

01:37.890 --> 01:39.266
I'm good. You know,
just trucking away.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.601
Y-you happy?

01:40.684 --> 01:42.853
Me? Filled with fuckin' mirth.

01:42.937 --> 01:43.813
In fact,

01:44.730 --> 01:46.607
I want to tell you
something important.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.818
You know, the network
execs are very pleased.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.237
Okay, you're doing a great
job steering the ship.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.740
All right, your ratings have
held solid all year long.

01:54.824 --> 01:57.159
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I get to tell you this.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.703
They want to lock you in

01:59.787 --> 02:01.872
for a seven-season contract.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.207
Seven seasons?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.792
Yeah! Yes, sir!

02:04.875 --> 02:06.210
- Uh, yeah.
- Congratulations!

02:06.293 --> 02:07.628
Come on!

02:07.711 --> 02:10.172
- Whoo! Huh?
- Wow, that's crazy.

02:10.256 --> 02:11.966
You're speechless, I get it.
I get it.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.300
I reacted the exact same
way when they gave me

02:13.384 --> 02:14.885
my first deal for
Jeff a la Carte.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.679
Hey.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.013
Incredible news.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.306
This is a beautiful day.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.433
I'm gonna go strawberry picking
with the wife and kids.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.144
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, thanks.

02:23.227 --> 02:25.312
- Fucking gangster.
- Thanks.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.857
Hey, Dev.

02:27.940 --> 02:31.277
Apparently, the network
definitely wants to get a shot

02:31.360 --> 02:33.362
with the PTSD, so you mind
if we get another take?

02:33.445 --> 02:34.822
Are you sure?

02:36.198 --> 02:37.241
Actually, you're right.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.451
Um, they definitely don't want

02:39.535 --> 02:41.036
another shot with it in there.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.330
We probably should really work
on our communication, man.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.166
- We?
- Yeah, we.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.835
Motherfucker, we talking now.
It takes two to tango.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.336
Motherfucker said "we."

02:49.420 --> 02:51.172
You ain't French, motherfucker.

03:34.340 --> 03:37.426
All right, so... I
wanted to talk to you

03:37.509 --> 03:39.261
about this Clash of
the Cupcakes-thing.

03:39.345 --> 03:40.346
Mm-hmm.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.557
I am so flattered. Um...

03:43.641 --> 03:46.018
I can't believe you guys
would want to work with me

03:46.101 --> 03:48.938
for seven seasons, and it seems
like a tremendous opportunity,

03:48.979 --> 03:52.858
but I-- I don't think it's
the right fit for me.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.652
What are you talking about?

03:54.735 --> 03:55.694
You don't want to do it?

03:57.446 --> 03:59.365
It's just that I'm not

03:59.448 --> 04:01.700
super passionate about the show.

04:01.784 --> 04:04.036
And if I'm doing it
for seven seasons,

04:04.119 --> 04:05.246
that's a long time.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.789
And I-- I don't think

04:06.872 --> 04:08.582
it'd be fair to you or to me

04:08.666 --> 04:10.459
if I-- if I did
something like that

04:10.542 --> 04:13.003
without my heart being
fully invested in it,

04:13.087 --> 04:14.964
you know what I mean? I mean...

04:15.047 --> 04:17.633
I hope I'm not pissing you off

04:17.716 --> 04:18.676
or pissing the network off--

04:18.759 --> 04:20.135
Are you kidding me?

04:22.513 --> 04:24.265
Are you fucking kidding me?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.144
Damn it, you got character!

04:29.228 --> 04:31.188
Man of principle here!
I love it.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.439
- Ha.
- Are you serious?

04:32.523 --> 04:33.732
Yeah, I'm serious. I love it!

04:33.816 --> 04:35.025
I thought you were
gonna hate me.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.860
What, are you high?
Come on, man.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.821
You know, most people would
have just taken the money.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.572
Not you. You come
in here, you...

04:40.656 --> 04:42.199
fuckin' slap your balls

04:42.283 --> 04:44.410
on my beautiful
mahogany table like,

04:44.493 --> 04:46.078
"Yeah, no, I'm not interested."

04:46.161 --> 04:47.705
Tell you what I'm mad about,
I'm mad about you putting

04:47.788 --> 04:49.498
your balls on my table. I
got fucking work to do.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.208
You get your balls off
my table, please?

04:51.292 --> 04:52.334
Will you get your balls
off my table, please?

04:52.418 --> 04:53.460
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm getting them.

04:53.544 --> 04:54.503
- Thank you.
- I'm getting them, apologize.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.213
Hey, man, fuck
all this noise, okay?

04:56.297 --> 04:58.173
Let's just go out, get
something to eat.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.883
Take me to that Indian place
you keep talking about.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.593
- Let's go.
- Whoo!

05:02.303 --> 05:04.972
- This fucking fish is awesome.
- I know, right?

05:05.055 --> 05:08.517
Mmm. You eat your way
across India yet?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.853
You know, I haven't
been in a long time.

05:10.936 --> 05:11.937
Really?

05:12.521 --> 05:13.689
Well, it's interesting, right?

05:13.772 --> 05:15.566
I mean, you spent all that time

05:15.649 --> 05:17.526
studying the food in Italy,

05:17.609 --> 05:19.528
but you haven't explored
your own roots yet.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.863
You know what I thought about?

05:20.946 --> 05:22.364
When I lived in Italy,

05:22.448 --> 05:24.074
I lived in this small town.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.617
I really got to know the locals.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.328
I learned how to cook
from a real grandma.

05:27.411 --> 05:28.912
It was so fun.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.081
I would love to do
that in India...

05:31.749 --> 05:33.542
or anywhere, you know?

05:33.625 --> 05:35.085
That's what I should
do as a show.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.420
What if I did
something like that?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.088
As a travel show?

05:38.172 --> 05:39.923
And it could be my
version of Jeff's Table.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.508
Are you kidding me? I
would love that show.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.136
I'd love it, but it's a
big investment, Dev.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.637
And you're a new face.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.598
I couldn't -
I couldn't give you

05:47.681 --> 05:48.932
your own travel show right now.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.768
But look, man, I
understand, okay?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.478
I understand that

05:52.561 --> 05:54.188
Clash of the Cupcakes
isn't ideal, okay?

05:54.229 --> 05:56.315
But you're on a really
cool ladder, man.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.192
I mean, why jump off
on the first rung?

05:58.275 --> 05:59.610
I want to keep you
at the network.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.863
Look, to be honest, there's no
diversity in the food world.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.448
Okay, look at our hosts.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.034
If-- If our lineup
were ingredients,

06:07.117 --> 06:09.787
we'd be flour, salt,
and sugar, all white.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.165
Will you sleep on it for me?

06:13.874 --> 06:14.708
Sure.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.418
Thank you.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.255
By the way, I'm the only white
guy in this restaurant.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.382
That's why it's good.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.633
Don't tell any other
white people about it.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.718
I don't want it to get ruined.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.554
What'd you do last night?

06:27.638 --> 06:29.598
I ate dinner with a companion.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.516
It was fun.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.351
Who was the companion?

06:33.936 --> 06:36.563
Um, a woman I know.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.691
Was it romantic?

06:41.110 --> 06:43.404
I would say yes.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.448
Well, how'd it go?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.493
Dad, you can talk
to me about this.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.745
Like, we can talk about this.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.873
It went very well.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.626
Well, that's great.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.504
It's cool you're going on dates.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.673
What's the deal with this lady?

07:02.756 --> 07:05.342
Her name is Linda. She's Korean.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.011
She works at a medical
supply store.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.764
She cooks very good food.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.599
Her eyes are nice.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.977
And her hair is also nice.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.937
That's always a bonus.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.272
Sounds promising.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.275
Yes, however,

07:21.358 --> 07:23.569
there's another woman as well.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.573
Wait, you're seeing two people?

07:27.656 --> 07:28.740
Yes.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.034
The other one's named Ellen.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.870
She's a CPA.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.122
She has a dog named Coco.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.249
I love Coco very much.

07:37.833 --> 07:41.003
I find it very entertaining
to spend time with him.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.963
She sounds great too.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.549
Yes, I'm very pleased.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.385
But at the same time,
it's quite a conundrum.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.095
I like both of these women,

07:50.179 --> 07:51.972
but I need to choose one.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.390
What do you think?

07:54.433 --> 07:57.436
I mean, it's kind of hard for
me to answer that for you.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.772
I guess I would just ask myself,

08:00.856 --> 08:02.691
who do I feel more
strongly about?

08:02.774 --> 08:04.276
Like, when I wake
up in the morning,

08:04.359 --> 08:06.904
who do I want to
spend the day with?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.655
Hmm.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.824
That's a nice way to
solve the problem.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.785
I will break up with Linda.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.829
At once.

08:16.622 --> 08:17.539
So Linda,

08:17.623 --> 08:19.750
there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.502
Sure, what is it?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.506
This smells really good.
What is this?

08:25.589 --> 08:27.090
It's yukgaejang-

08:27.174 --> 08:29.426
It's beef stew with kimchi.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.303
I've been cooking this all day.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.263
You're gonna really like it.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.475
Mmm.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.602
Mmm, these flavors,

08:38.685 --> 08:39.895
they're phenomenal.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.605
I still have many more dishes

08:41.688 --> 08:43.524
I'd like to cook for you.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.320
This is interesting information.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.906
What did you want to
talk to me about?

08:52.616 --> 08:55.494
Oh, there's a new coffee
shop in my neighborhood.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.828
Oh.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.331
You don't drink coffee, do you?

08:59.957 --> 09:02.417
No, but it's fascinating.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.753
The city is always changing.

09:04.836 --> 09:05.963
It's true.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.344
I really like this stew.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.183
How is the cupcake show going?

09:18.267 --> 09:19.977
Eh, it's all right.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.562
I got some crazy news this week.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.647
They want me to do the
show for seven seasons.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.857
I'm not sure I can do
the show for that long.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.569
It's a good job, man.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.988
You don't work that much.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.657
I don't even know why they pay.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.033
I will host the show.

09:35.117 --> 09:38.704
The winning cupcake is...

09:38.787 --> 09:42.916
the tasty cupcake made
by the white lady.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.835
Whee!

09:45.794 --> 09:47.879
Yeah, that was-- that's
pretty much what I do.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.423
You just started.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.216
You want to quit now?

09:51.300 --> 09:52.926
You're a doctor.
That's a great job.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.637
You're helping people. Clash
of the Cupcakes stinks.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.306
My job stinks too.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.183
Come and see what all I
have to do in my rounds.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.602
I should probably go home.

10:01.685 --> 10:02.728
Come on, man.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.147
See your old man in action.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.650
It will be like the TV
show Grey's Anatomy,

10:08.734 --> 10:11.069
but this time, it's with me.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.654
I'm the McDreamy.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.615
Jesus, fine, I'll come.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.617
I'll be McSteamy.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.287
Hey, what's that?

10:20.370 --> 10:22.039
SpongeBob.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.290
A guy swallowed it.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.417
I pulled it out of his
stomach this morning.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.543
Why'd you keep it?

10:26.627 --> 10:29.921
I have to add it
to my collection.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.549
Whoa! These are all things you
pulled out of people's stomachs?

10:32.633 --> 10:34.635
- Yep.
- Gross.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.596
There is a story
behind each thing.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.557
This one, a man
accidentally swallowed it.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.978
This one, a lady swallowed it.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.315
And this--

10:48.398 --> 10:49.524
Someone accidentally
swallowed it?

10:49.608 --> 10:50.651
You got it!

10:50.734 --> 10:51.818
Do they ever want to keep it?

10:51.902 --> 10:53.487
I tell them we threw them out.

10:54.780 --> 10:55.697
Is that a wedding ring?

10:57.032 --> 10:59.076
Ehh, I should not
have kept that one.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.247
Hey, Doc, we've got an
emergency, foreign body.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.667
Thank you.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.253
Holy cow!

11:10.337 --> 11:11.672
Doesn't look good.

11:11.755 --> 11:12.881
What's happening?

11:12.964 --> 11:15.175
This guy put a
toothbrush in his butt.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.178
It got stuck. I have
to take it out.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.806
Ooh, this is already much worse
than Clash of the Cupcakes.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.224
Why'd he put a
toothbrush in his butt?

11:22.307 --> 11:24.267
His wife is out of town.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.727
He got horny.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.437
Mm.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.149
Doctor, this is
Donald's wife, Carol.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.567
Hi, Carol.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.152
Oh, my God, is everything okay?

11:34.236 --> 11:36.571
What happened? Did he
have a heart attack?

11:36.655 --> 11:40.325
No, he put an electric
toothbrush in his butt.

11:40.409 --> 11:41.952
What?

11:42.035 --> 11:44.162
I didn't even know he had
an electric toothbrush.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.998
Not really the
surprising part of the story.

11:47.082 --> 11:49.418
- Who's this?
- This is my son.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.461
You want to really
see the toothbrush?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.422
See that?

11:53.505 --> 11:54.589
Damn!

11:54.673 --> 11:56.466
It is really up in there.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.553
Is he supposed to be here?

11:59.636 --> 12:00.971
Not really.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.389
Lot of things are ending up

12:02.472 --> 12:04.099
where they don't belong today.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.518
Ha-ha. Sorry, Carol.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.019
He will do fine.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.480
I will get it out
one way or another.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.817
I'll go wait in
the waiting room.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.235
Okay.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.697
All right, it was fun
seeing you do your rounds.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.532
Uh, I think I'm gonna head out.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.951
You're not gonna put the toothbrush
in the collection, are you?

12:23.034 --> 12:23.952
No.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.537
Anything comes out of the butt,

12:25.620 --> 12:26.997
they get to keep it.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.291
Yeah, that's probably
a good rule.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.543
So how'd it go with Linda?

12:31.626 --> 12:32.919
Was it a tough breakup?

12:33.003 --> 12:35.213
I tried to break up with her,

12:35.297 --> 12:37.966
but she made me this
fantastic stew.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.302
It tasted so good, I
just couldn't do it.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.388
I'm now thinking I'll
break up with Ellen.

12:43.472 --> 12:44.639
What do you think?

12:46.057 --> 12:48.810
I don't know, man. It's
hard for me to weigh in.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.896
Might help if I tasted the stew.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.314
Any leftovers?

12:52.397 --> 12:53.482
There were,

12:53.565 --> 12:55.233
but I woke up late at night,

12:55.317 --> 12:57.110
made a snack.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.279
The snack was the stew.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.323
Yeah. Got that.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.450
I must break up with Ellen.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.370
And then we found
the spreadsheets

13:07.454 --> 13:09.331
were in the hot tub
the whole time.

13:09.414 --> 13:12.042
I mean, it was the craziest
audit I've ever done.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.544
That's an interesting story.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.587
Mm-hmm.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.172
- Ellen?
- Hmm?

13:17.255 --> 13:18.799
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.176
- Oh, sure, what is it?
- Oh, look who's here!

13:21.259 --> 13:22.886
- Hi, Coco.
- Oh, Coco!

13:22.969 --> 13:24.179
Come here, baby.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.514
- Give me a kiss, baby.
- Oh, he I...

13:25.597 --> 13:28.016
- Oh!
- Give Peter a kiss.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.477
Oh, 'cause I'm gonna
give Peter a kiss.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.814
- You're such a good dog.
- Oh, yes, I am.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.732
Coco, that's enough
kissing for you.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.984
- Go on.
- Oh, Coco, Coco, stay.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.611
- Mm! Mm!
- Stay, Coco.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.405
Lawrence, checked the rundown.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.824
Everything looks good.
You all right?

13:43.907 --> 13:46.827
Bad news. The magician
guy Lance Burton?

13:46.910 --> 13:48.328
- He dropped out.
- What happened?

13:48.411 --> 13:50.455
Apparently, he retired
a few years ago.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.290
And I booked the
wrong Lance Burton.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.543
Like, I booked some dude
that owns a Kia dealership

13:54.626 --> 13:55.877
in Baltimore.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.712
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

13:57.796 --> 13:59.214
It was a little last-minute,

13:59.297 --> 14:01.258
but I was able to get
a replacement judge.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.885
The Magnificent Kenny.
He's a pro.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.345
Now, if you will all
excuse me for a second,

14:05.428 --> 14:07.973
I have to use my handkerchief.

14:08.056 --> 14:11.685
Oh,
what do we have here?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.728
- Ah.
- Oh, my God!

14:13.854 --> 14:17.148
Our old friend the
three of diamonds.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.025
Damn!

14:19.109 --> 14:21.319
How he be doing that?

14:23.280 --> 14:24.239
- Hey!
- Hey.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.448
I'm Dev. I host the show.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.409
I just wanted to say thanks
so much for being a judge.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.411
Oh, no problem, man. Thank you.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.038
- And, uh, thanks for the gift.
- Oh, yeah, cupcakes.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.540
I know it's a little on the nose.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.041
So, urn, yeah, how's
everything going?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.334
How's the magician life?

14:36.418 --> 14:38.169
Great. Great, man.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.588
Work's been good, yeah.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.299
I just booked a weekly
job at a casino.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.508
Ooh, on the Strip?

14:43.592 --> 14:44.718
No, no.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.803
Small town in
Connecticut, but, um,

14:46.887 --> 14:48.555
it's been years since
I've been to Vegas.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.807
- Years.
- Oh.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.309
Anyway, you want to see, uh,

14:52.392 --> 14:54.019
a trick I'm gonna
perform on the show?

14:54.102 --> 14:55.687
- Sure.
- All right, here we go.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.731
- I need you to pick a card.
- Okay.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.274
Okay, put that back in the deck.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.442
All right.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.153
And what I'm gonna
show you right now

15:03.236 --> 15:05.363
is, what I have is a tiny car.

15:05.447 --> 15:06.948
- Mm.
- That is a very tiny car.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.533
But the thing about this car

15:08.617 --> 15:10.160
is that it's a magic car.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.953
- Oh.
- This car is...

15:12.996 --> 15:14.414
Fuck it!

15:14.497 --> 15:16.458
Bullshit! Fuck that.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.168
God damn it.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.588
Is this part of the trick?

15:21.671 --> 15:23.131
Look, man,

15:23.214 --> 15:25.091
I can't go out there.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.468
I'm too nervous, man.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.802
I've never been on
television before.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.262
I don't want to do it.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.640
Besides, I was your
15th choice anyway.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.099
Hey, that's not true.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.434
That's what your producer said.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.519
He said he was desperate.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.105
I'm sorry, he shouldn't be saying
that kind of stuff to people.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.982
Would you just go and check

15:41.066 --> 15:42.025
and see if I can quit?

15:42.108 --> 15:43.026
No.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.736
I just need to...

15:44.819 --> 15:46.363
just sit down and consider

15:46.446 --> 15:48.448
the grandest illusion
of them all.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.699
Me.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.536
Wow. Did you just come
up with that now?

15:53.620 --> 15:54.663
No.

15:54.746 --> 15:55.997
My wife yelled it at me

15:56.081 --> 15:57.958
during an argument years ago.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.418
And she's been using it
quite frequently lately.

16:00.502 --> 16:01.920
It just, um...

16:03.004 --> 16:04.965
So you didn't break
up with Ellen either?

16:05.590 --> 16:08.343
I had too much fun with Coco.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.845
He's a very fun
animal to play with.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.806
So what are you gonna
do about Linda?

16:12.889 --> 16:14.808
I'll keep seeing both of them.

16:14.891 --> 16:18.269
I spoke with them, and they
were okay with the arrangement.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.146
My man Peter Chang,

16:20.230 --> 16:22.524
kicking it with
two "hi, cuties"!

16:22.607 --> 16:24.025
Nice!

16:24.109 --> 16:25.568
Thank you, Arnold.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.904
You gotta tell me your
secret, Uncle Pete.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.572
My secret is that

16:29.656 --> 16:33.201
people my age often
feel very alone.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.830
This makes them open up to
situations that are not ideal

16:36.913 --> 16:39.541
in exchange for temporary
companionship.

16:39.624 --> 16:40.875
Oh.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.628
I thought it would
be a funner secret.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.340
Kenny.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.092
Now, what's going on here?

16:49.175 --> 16:51.636
Look, I'm packing up my stuff

16:51.720 --> 16:52.887
and I'm getting out of here.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.723
- Huh.
- I'm sorry, man,

16:54.806 --> 16:56.683
to bail on you so
last-minute like this,

16:56.766 --> 17:00.061
but it's best for both
of us, believe me.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.605
Mm. Best for both of us, huh?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.733
Packing up your flowers
and your handkerchiefs

17:04.816 --> 17:05.734
and you're heading out?

17:05.817 --> 17:07.694
Well, not feeling

17:07.777 --> 17:09.446
very magnificent these days.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.864
Not lately, you know.

17:10.947 --> 17:12.115
I don't believe that.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.616
'Cause you know
what I saw earlier?

17:13.700 --> 17:16.661
I saw you backstage,
doing some tricks.

17:16.745 --> 17:19.456
I saw people laughing and smiling
and having a grand old time.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.082
You saw that?

17:21.166 --> 17:22.625
- Yeah.
- That was good.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.169
- It felt good, right?
- Yeah.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.046
So why don't you forget
about those cameras

17:26.129 --> 17:27.881
and think about that
studio audience?

17:27.964 --> 17:29.340
Those are people out there,

17:29.424 --> 17:30.592
people that want to smile

17:30.675 --> 17:32.844
and have fun and see magic.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.763
- And I think you can bring it to them.
- Yeah.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.598
You are The Magnificent
Kenny, aren't you?

17:36.681 --> 17:38.683
I am The Magnificent Kenny.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.185
You're The Magnificent Kenny!

17:40.268 --> 17:41.978
I am The Magnificent Kenny!

17:42.103 --> 17:43.563
You're gonna go out there?
You're in?

17:43.646 --> 17:45.190
- I'm in, man.
- There you go.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.900
Hey, that's awesome.
It's awesome.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.485
Dev, you know what?

17:48.568 --> 17:51.029
Looks like I'm not the only
one that can do magic here.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.199
Did you just come
up with that now?

17:55.033 --> 17:56.576
No, no, I, uh,

17:56.659 --> 17:58.369
used to say it to
my wife years ago,

17:58.453 --> 18:01.456
and then we hit a little rough
patch that we're in now.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.546
Now, you signed your card

18:08.630 --> 18:10.131
and placed it in this
deck, am I right?

18:10.215 --> 18:11.966
- That's true.
- That's true.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.343
Check your jacket pocket.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.221
No. Come on.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.473
What? Oh, my God, it's here.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.853
All right, Magnificent Kenny,
well, the competition is over,

18:23.978 --> 18:25.605
and it's time for these
cupcakes to clash.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.565
Now, I understand
you've prepared

18:27.649 --> 18:29.526
an extra-special taste
test for us today.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.529
You know, I had a chance to
taste the cupcakes in the back.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.155
And I'd like to reveal my winner

18:34.239 --> 18:35.990
with one last trick.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.284
Mmm, does that sound
good to you guys?

18:38.368 --> 18:39.828
- Come on, guys!
- Yeah!

18:41.496 --> 18:45.125
This is a cupcake-themed
variation of three-card monte.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.835
I'll take the two final cupcakes

18:46.918 --> 18:48.920
and place cups on top of them.

18:49.003 --> 18:52.590
Under the third cup, I'll
place a sharp spike.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.301
Dev, make sure that's sharp.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.594
- Ouch.
- Ooh, it's sharp, guys.

18:56.678 --> 18:57.929
Whoo.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.013
All righty.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.140
Put that on top of there.

19:00.223 --> 19:02.350
Now, with magnificent speed,

19:02.433 --> 19:04.227
I will shuffle these cups.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.275
All right!

19:10.358 --> 19:12.318
Now I will smash the cup

19:12.402 --> 19:14.988
of the cupcake I did not choose.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.072
You ready?

19:16.156 --> 19:17.198
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

19:17.282 --> 19:20.910
Let me hear you say, "Smash
that cup, Magnificent Kenny."

19:20.994 --> 19:22.996
Smash that cup,
Magnificent Kenny.

19:23.079 --> 19:26.958
Come on, "Smash that
cup, Magnificent Kenny."

19:27.041 --> 19:29.752
Smash that cup,
Magnificent Kenny.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.296
One.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.798
Two.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.260
Three.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.059
Oh, God, God!

19:45.143 --> 19:46.060
Oh, my God!

19:46.144 --> 19:47.520
Oh, my God, are you okay?

19:47.604 --> 19:48.730
I told you I couldn't do this!

19:48.813 --> 19:50.815
Why'd you give me such
an amazing pep talk?

19:50.899 --> 19:51.900
Lawrence! Lawrence!

19:51.983 --> 19:53.234
Call 911!

19:56.362 --> 19:57.655
Who won?

19:58.781 --> 20:00.617
There's been an
interesting development.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.577
Both women have
broken up with me.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.329
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.413
What happened?

20:05.496 --> 20:06.831
Even though they said

20:06.915 --> 20:09.000
they were happy with
the arrangement...

20:11.085 --> 20:12.962
they actually were not.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.840
Well, yeah. That makes sense.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.051
What are you gonna do now?

20:18.134 --> 20:19.427
It's okay.

20:19.510 --> 20:20.970
I adopted a new friend.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.598
Come here, boy. Come here.

20:24.182 --> 20:25.975
- Come here.
- Whoa!

20:26.601 --> 20:28.186
You got a dog, Dad?

20:28.269 --> 20:30.313
- Yep.
- What's its name?

20:30.396 --> 20:32.523
Coco.

20:32.607 --> 20:35.568
Wait, wasn't that
Ellen's dog's name?

20:35.652 --> 20:36.986
Yes.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.031
You can't name it
the same thing.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.700
Why not?

20:43.326 --> 20:44.869
I guess you're right.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.330
Hi, Coco. Hi, Coco.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.332
Coco's a big dog.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.501
Jesus. Hi, Coco.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.835
That's Brian.

20:52.919 --> 20:53.836
So...

20:55.546 --> 20:57.382
I've thought about everything.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.592
And hosting Clash
of the Cupcakes

20:59.676 --> 21:02.011
is definitely a great gig.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.014
But to be honest, I can't see

21:05.098 --> 21:07.850
myself being happy doing
that for seven seasons.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.852
Seven seasons is a long time.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.896
I mean, that's how long
The Sopranos was on.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.691
And no offense, I don't know
if Clash of the Cupcakes

21:14.774 --> 21:16.150
is as good as The Sopranos.

21:16.234 --> 21:19.404
So I don't want to
host that show.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.533
But... I have an idea.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.576
When I pitched you
my travel show,

21:25.660 --> 21:28.162
you told me you couldn't do it
'cause I'm too much of a new face.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.498
And I get that. You're right.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.666
But...

21:33.584 --> 21:35.086
what if we did it together?

21:36.004 --> 21:38.256
You're a great face. People know you.
They love you.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.675
They miss seeing you doing
these travel shows.

21:40.758 --> 21:43.303
Think about it. We
travel together.

21:43.386 --> 21:44.721
We eat together.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.348
We learn about the
culture together.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.267
And we call it...

21:49.350 --> 21:51.144
BFFs.'

21:51.227 --> 21:53.271
Best Food Friends.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.190
Best...

21:56.274 --> 21:57.984
Food Friends?

21:58.067 --> 22:01.070
Best Food Friends.

22:02.905 --> 22:05.074
Best Food Friends.

22:10.246 --> 22:14.917
Best... Food... Friends.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.132
Best

22:21.215 --> 22:23.760
Food Friends?

22:24.844 --> 22:26.888
Best Food Friends.

22:28.765 --> 22:29.682
I love it!

22:29.766 --> 22:30.975
- Really?
- I love it!

22:31.059 --> 22:32.769
I love it. It is great!

22:32.852 --> 22:34.729
I mean, I've been dying
to figure out a reason

22:34.812 --> 22:35.980
to get back on the road, right?

22:36.064 --> 22:37.732
And it's fresh. It's new.

22:37.815 --> 22:38.858
I love it.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.443
Oh, my God. Look at you, huh?

22:40.526 --> 22:42.070
This guy, he comes
into my office.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.155
He slams his balls on my table.

22:44.238 --> 22:45.990
Walks out, comes back
a few days later,

22:46.074 --> 22:48.368
drops his pants, pisses
genius all over my office.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.078
These metaphors are getting
really disgusting.

22:50.161 --> 22:53.081
You, me, Best Food Friends.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.791
Let's do it! Whoo!

22:54.874 --> 22:55.875
- Ha-ha!
- Yes.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.296
Ciao, Francesca, how are you?

23:00.380 --> 23:03.216
I'm good. I'm really good.
How are you?

23:03.299 --> 23:05.301
I just got some crazy news.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.637
I'm gonna do this new
TV show with Chef Jeff

23:07.720 --> 23:10.181
where it's just me and him traveling
around, eating good food.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.974
I'm done with Clash
of the Cupcakes.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.560
That sounds great. I'm
so happy for you.

23:14.644 --> 23:15.895
How's everything with you?

23:15.978 --> 23:19.816
Well, I have some
crazy news too.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.819
Um, I got engaged.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.405
Wow.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.156
I'm engaged! I know!

23:27.240 --> 23:29.117
It's cool. I mean, I'm so happy.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.576
- Yeah.
- Really happy.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.036
I'm happy for you too.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.371
Thank you.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.207
I mean, I don't know when
this is gonna happen.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.459
I don't know where,
but I think soon.

23:38.543 --> 23:40.545
I hope so.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.922
Yeah. That's really cool.
