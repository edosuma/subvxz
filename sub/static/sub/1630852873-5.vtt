00:23.200 --> 00:25.200
Early, around six.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.400
The pool would be closed when I got there.
No one else around.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.440
And then he would arrive.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.960
He gave me a key to the staff entrance.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.000
I wasn't supposed to tell anyone

00:44.040 --> 00:45.280
'cause I'd get in trouble.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.520
We'd work on my technique,

00:50.480 --> 00:52.400
turns, position in the water,

00:52.480 --> 00:53.560
for about an hour.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.640
Then after practice, he'd…

01:03.800 --> 01:06.880
Sometimes I'd be able to get out of it
when school started early.

01:09.640 --> 01:10.920
I'm so sorry.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.600
I never told my mum.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.120
She loved him. I wanted to protect her.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.400
But I regret that now.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.520
It wasn't your fault.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.880
You were just a child.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.120
But what if he did it to other girls?

01:32.200 --> 01:34.840
Alexia, none of this was ever your fault.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.000
Did you know Elias Fager?

01:43.080 --> 01:47.200
No. He was in the seventh grade,
but his big brother was in my class.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.480
So you've never written a letter to Elias?

01:50.000 --> 01:50.840
No.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.920
Do you know if anyone else
had the same access to the pool as you?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm not sure.

01:56.080 --> 01:59.920
There were a few of us who were training
to compete, but I don't know.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.840
The letters are from a victim of Moberg's
thanking Elias for protecting her.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.400
So it seems, yeah.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.600
But not Alexia?

02:38.680 --> 02:41.040
I mean, we can't rule it out,
but I don't think so.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.680
I think she was telling me the truth.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.480
If she didn't write them, then who did?

02:46.880 --> 02:49.960
And what, if anything,
has this got to do with Elias's death?

02:50.040 --> 02:51.400
We're working on it, sir.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.800
-Hey, where you going?
-Come on.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.160
-Where?
-Going to see Rask.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.320
Again? You want to get us all fired?

03:11.400 --> 03:13.800
She needs to know about Alexia and Moberg.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.440
All right.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.680
We did all the usual background checks.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.800
Signs of abuse, it's the first thing
we look for. You know that.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.400
We followed all the protocol.
There was no sign of it.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.640
Ugh, how did I miss this?

03:32.040 --> 03:35.680
Suppose that Elias Fager
knew what Jörgen Moberg was doing?

03:38.080 --> 03:39.440
But why keep it a secret?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.720
What do you mean?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.600
Elias was crucified by the press.
He had to go into hiding.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.120
He could have avoided that

03:45.200 --> 03:47.360
if people only knew
what kind of man Moberg was.

03:51.720 --> 03:55.080
Well, didn't Sören say
that Elias wanted to tell him something?

03:55.160 --> 03:56.480
Yeah, that's right.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.440
Is that why Elias was killed?

03:59.040 --> 04:02.040
-To keep him quiet about Moberg?
-Moberg's dead.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.920
Who else would suffer
if the truth came out?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.240
-Whoever wrote those letters.
-Exactly.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.560
Sören never mentioned anything
about Moberg being a pedophile either.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.640
Plus the guy breaks into Rask's apartment
demanding information.

04:16.720 --> 04:17.960
Maybe even he didn't know.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.160
Yeah, but why join in the attack?

04:21.360 --> 04:23.720
The report says he was drunk, high.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.800
I mean, Sören hated Moberg enough.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.560
Wherever he is,
he'll be looking for answers now.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.760
So we need to find him
before he finds the killer.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.680
Or before the killer finds him.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.160
Did you speak to Fred?

04:34.240 --> 04:36.240
Yeah, there's an APB out on Sören.

04:36.760 --> 04:41.440
Patrols are checking city missions,
shelters, mates from prison.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.080
Border Police have his photo,
but nothing yet.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.400
What do you wanna do?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.360
I'll have a look
at Elias's old classmates again.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.200
Then I'll go back to the hit-and-run.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.280
<i>All right, I'm gonna</i>
<i>ask again. What happened next, Sören?</i>

06:11.320 --> 06:12.600
<i>I don't remember.</i>

06:12.680 --> 06:13.800
<i>You don't remember?</i>

06:14.560 --> 06:17.120
<i>I just told you, I don't remember.</i>

06:17.720 --> 06:20.080
This guy knew exactly what he was doing.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.520
Come again?

06:21.600 --> 06:23.800
-The break-in at the garage.
-Yeah.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.680
In and out, four minutes.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.320
No alarm. No trace.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.680
It's like the guy is flipping us off.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.080
You know, he breaks into <i>our </i>garage,

06:32.760 --> 06:34.560
steals <i>our </i>untraceable car,

06:35.240 --> 06:38.680
and then uses it as a weapon to commit
a murder. Now we can't find him anywhere.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.600
Kurt, we've been
running round in circles, man.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.680
And I think that we should
start looking at our own.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.320
Disgruntled officers, you know.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.520
People who've been
slapped on the wrist or even fired.

06:54.040 --> 06:54.920
Do it.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.520
Hey.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.720
Sorry I'm so late.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.080
What's going on?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.160
It's this appeal we've been working on.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.400
Turns out our boy lied about his origin
to have a better shot at asylum.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.440
He grew up in Iran,
but with Afghan parents,

07:56.520 --> 07:59.040
so he'll be sent back.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.840
I'm sorry.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.280
You know what it's like
for Afghans in Iran?

08:06.040 --> 08:08.000
He was beaten every day,

08:09.520 --> 08:11.440
and it will just keep happening.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.600
If that's the case,
shouldn't he get asylum anyway?

08:15.680 --> 08:19.080
No. You lie at the border, your
application automatically gets rejected.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.120
So now what?

08:20.720 --> 08:23.720
He was abused.
Of course he would lie to save his life.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.040
Some people just don't get a chance.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.720
You know?

08:29.600 --> 08:30.440
Yeah.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.600
<i>Something I have to tell you.</i>

09:39.120 --> 09:41.160
There's things you don't know.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.200
<i>"Thank you. You saved my life."</i>

09:43.280 --> 09:45.520
<i>"I am eternally grateful to you."</i>

09:45.600 --> 09:47.480
<i>Who was he trying to save?</i>

10:23.960 --> 10:24.800
Rask?

10:26.280 --> 10:28.240
-Hey.
What are you doing here?

10:29.400 --> 10:32.160
Just taking a trip down memory lane.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.640
Didn't occur to me for a second
there might be more to it.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.040
It didn't occur to anyone.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.160
-Except you.
-Come on.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.080
Eight years later, with hindsight
and a completely different perspective.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.320
Don't do that.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.240
Any joy with the letters? The girl?

10:50.320 --> 10:51.400
Working on it.

10:51.920 --> 10:56.400
We're gonna call Elias's old classmates,
see if they know about the letters.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.680
-Will you let me make the calls?
-I honestly don't--

10:58.760 --> 10:59.640
Please.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.760
I can't stop you, can I?

11:04.920 --> 11:07.520
I just need a chance
to try and put some of this right.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.040
This is the staff entrance
you wanted to see.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.760
How many keys to this door?

11:28.600 --> 11:31.200
Uh, staff have one each.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.360
I have one, so do the cleaners.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.840
And there's a spare, so six.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.080
-And then I stole the key.
-To the staff entrance?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.400
Mr. Moberg kept a spare in his office.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.400
<i>And the Halloween masks,</i>
<i>when did Sören buy those?</i>

11:55.480 --> 11:57.280
<i>We picked them up on the way.</i>

11:58.120 --> 11:59.960
<i>We waited for him in the changing rooms.</i>

12:02.200 --> 12:05.120
<i>Mr. Moberg came in,</i>
<i>and Sören came from behind</i>

12:05.200 --> 12:06.560
<i>and hit him in the head.</i>

12:07.560 --> 12:09.360
<i>With the broom?</i>

12:11.080 --> 12:12.360
<i>He tried to get away,</i>

12:12.440 --> 12:15.000
-<i>but Sören hit him again.</i>

12:16.320 --> 12:18.000
<i>And what did you do?</i>

12:20.280 --> 12:21.720
-<i> I kicked him.</i>

12:21.800 --> 12:23.920
<i>Mr. Moberg tried to hide</i>
<i>in the sauna, but…</i>

12:27.520 --> 12:29.040
<i>but Sören kept hitting him.</i>

12:41.920 --> 12:44.600
<i>Sören locked Mr. Moberg</i>
<i>in the sauna, didn't he?</i>

12:50.480 --> 12:51.640
<i>He'd been drinking.</i>

12:51.720 --> 12:52.920
<i>He passed out.</i>

12:53.000 --> 12:54.480
<i>I dragged him out of there.</i>

12:58.800 --> 13:00.720
Then he woke up, and we walked home.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.640
Could you just show me
Moberg's old office?

13:14.720 --> 13:17.440
Yeah, sure, but it's not much
to see, really.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.920
Yeah. Thanks.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.640
Okay.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.720
<i>He left it unlocked sometimes.</i>

13:50.520 --> 13:52.680
Does this door always lock when it closes?

13:53.280 --> 13:55.840
-Yes.
-It was the same when Moberg worked here?

13:55.920 --> 13:56.960
Yeah.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.320
The office Elias claims
he stole the key from

14:02.400 --> 14:03.640
has a self-locking door.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.960
It did when Moberg was around too.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.680
<i>It's unlikely that Elias</i>
<i>could've slipped in there</i>,

14:08.760 --> 14:11.400
and I've just seen
the municipality's locksmith.

14:11.480 --> 14:15.080
Jörgen Moberg signed
for two extra keys in three years.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.560
One for Alexia and one for someone else.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.640
I don't think Elias ever stole that key.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.080
-I think someone gave it to him.
-<i>Okay.</i>

14:24.160 --> 14:26.440
I'll narrow in on the swimming team,

14:26.520 --> 14:28.520
<i>anyone Moberg was coaching at the time.</i>

14:28.600 --> 14:29.640
Sounds good.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.640
Detective Abd Al-Rahman.

14:50.040 --> 14:50.920
Quick word?

14:59.760 --> 15:00.680
Close the door?

15:00.760 --> 15:01.600
Yeah.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.120
Please come and have a seat.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.120
How's it going?

15:11.080 --> 15:12.000
You settling in?

15:12.080 --> 15:15.440
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh…
It's great, actually.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.840
Good. It's been a while coming.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.200
It certainly has, sir.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.240
I just got in this report
from your fellow officer

15:25.320 --> 15:27.960
on the joyrider pursuit.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.480
There was an incident mid-chase.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.560
Yeah. Yes, sir. Um…

15:34.960 --> 15:38.560
Uh, we were in pursuit,
and a kid jumped out in front of us.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.440
Nightmare.

15:45.080 --> 15:45.920
Yeah.

15:52.880 --> 15:56.600
Well, says it was touch and go,
but that you handled it well.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.080
And how are you feeling?
It must've been a shock.

16:03.120 --> 16:06.560
No. Good. I mean,
that's when the training comes in handy.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.920
It's been a rough few weeks for you.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.880
Okay, that was all.

16:58.000 --> 16:58.840
Jesus.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.800
Hi, my name is, uh, Douglas Bergmark.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.440
I'm a relative
of an old classmate of yours.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.120
Elias Fager.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.120
He, uh… He recently passed.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.600
Yeah, thank you.
We were just clearing out his flat,

18:08.680 --> 18:11.760
and we came across some letters
that I think you wrote to him

18:11.840 --> 18:13.520
when you were both in school.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.440
It's quite personal letters.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.080
Listen, they're of no importance to us.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.920
I was just wondering
if you'd like to keep them

18:24.760 --> 18:26.680
or if we should throw them away.

18:30.560 --> 18:31.880
You didn't write them.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.880
No, no. There must've been a mistake.
Thank you.

18:35.960 --> 18:38.040
Hi. My, uh… My name is Douglas Bergmark.

18:38.560 --> 18:42.440
I'm a relative
of an old classmate of yours, Elias Fager.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.480
We found some old letters,
some personal letters.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.160
Just wondering if you would like
to keep them?

18:48.240 --> 18:50.800
No. I must've made a mistake. Thank you.

19:34.080 --> 19:37.560
-We're all gonna be going electric soon.
-And then I'll be out of a job.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.800
Oh, let's hope not.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.480
Detective Abd Al-Rahman.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.640
Petterson. What can I do for you?

19:43.720 --> 19:46.200
I'm here to follow up
on a few things about the break-in.

19:46.280 --> 19:49.240
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah, I mean, it's just formalities.

19:49.320 --> 19:53.320
Uh, I'm the new guy in the office,
so, uh, they sent me to do the donkeywork.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.680
But it'd be great if you could help me
fill in a few blanks.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.480
-Like what?
-Just timeline stuff.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.800
You know, for instance,
what time you came in

20:01.880 --> 20:03.760
the morning after the break-in.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.480
-You know, I'm not too sure. Let me check.
-Yeah, sure.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.160
Let's see.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.400
Let's see.

20:12.480 --> 20:16.320
Around nine, opened the place up.
Nothing seemed off then.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.760
And when did you leave the night before?

20:22.120 --> 20:25.120
Around 9:00, 9:30.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.280
Well…

20:27.960 --> 20:31.160
Did you see anything
or anyone lurking around?

20:31.240 --> 20:32.080
No.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.000
And I guess after a long shift,
you went straight home.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.120
Oh, yes.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.760
And was anybody else here then?

20:39.840 --> 20:40.880
Colleagues maybe?

20:42.320 --> 20:43.160
No.

20:44.880 --> 20:45.800
Hmm.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.400
-Well, this was a waste of time.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.400
-Thanks for helping me out.
-Anytime.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.280
Kurt, come and have a look at this.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.920
Staff car park behind the station.

21:09.040 --> 21:13.360
This Jeep here belongs to Joel Petterson,
who works in this building.

21:13.880 --> 21:18.080
This was taken the night of Elias's death,
one hour after he was killed.

21:19.160 --> 21:22.640
The Jeep isn't picked up
until the next day, here.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.840
Kurt, it was parked there
all day and all night before Elias dies.

21:28.920 --> 21:29.760
Okay.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.640
And then picked up
in the evening the day after.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.720
So how does Petterson go home
the night Elias dies?

21:35.800 --> 21:37.040
Uh…

21:37.120 --> 21:39.200
Took the bus, maybe got a ride.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.200
-Oh, come on.
-Walked?

21:40.280 --> 21:42.880
Kurt, the guy lives
20 kilometers away from Malmö,

21:42.960 --> 21:44.480
in the middle of nowhere!

21:45.000 --> 21:46.960
Why didn't he just take his car?

21:47.760 --> 21:49.320
Could be several reasons.

21:53.280 --> 21:54.320
Read this.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.520
Petterson applied to the police academy
three times in the 2000s.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.720
Never got in, not once.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.880
He's a reservist
and served in Afghanistan.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.560
He's an army man.

22:06.640 --> 22:07.720
Not anymore.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.600
He damaged his hearing
during a land-mine incident.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.880
He's had conflict with HR. They tried
to get rid of him for drinking on the job,

22:15.960 --> 22:18.560
but the union stopped it,
provided he go to AA meetings.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.200
And what exactly does he do here?

22:20.800 --> 22:22.720
He's one of our mechanics, Kurt.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.600
Here, in the police garage.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.600
Come on.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.960
He has inside knowledge
and a reason to hate us.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.120
-You're right.
-Yeah.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.080
Petterson knew that the car
never had a dashcam or a GPS.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.760
Do you think he faked the break-in?

22:40.120 --> 22:42.280
I've watched that CCTV footage
again and again.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.800
He's built like a tank.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.240
-He's our guy!
-Gotta be careful now, Rez.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.600
Did you find any ties to the Fagers?

22:48.680 --> 22:51.720
I mean, the guy's been online
screaming about our justice system,

22:51.800 --> 22:54.160
saying that
we treat criminals like babies.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.240
-He'd probably love to see Elias dead.
-But no real connection?

22:57.320 --> 23:00.320
Come on, man. We should bring him in
and put some pressure on him.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.640
-I don't think we can, not yet.
-Why the hell not?

23:03.680 --> 23:07.240
We have no evidence. We can't hold him.
He could disappear on us.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.600
The guy's lying!

23:09.120 --> 23:12.320
He says he went home that night
when we can prove his Jeep was here!

23:12.400 --> 23:13.920
Wait, wait. You haven't talked to him?

23:14.000 --> 23:16.200
I asked him a few questions
about the break-in.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.640
Just to make sure the timeline was solid.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.920
What were you thinking?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.080
I find the killer, and that's a problem?

23:22.160 --> 23:25.280
It's a problem if he suspects something
and starts cleaning up, yes.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.360
We can't afford any more slipups
in the investigation, Rez.

23:29.360 --> 23:32.320
Well, I ain't the one who slipped up
not bringing Katja Nilsson in.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.080
We have a strong suspect
for the killing, sir,

23:46.760 --> 23:48.960
and he works in this building
in the garage.

23:49.040 --> 23:52.240
His name is Joel Petterson.
He's a former military man.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.440
He knows our procedures,

23:54.520 --> 23:57.800
he had access to the car,
he knows that car can't be traced,

23:57.880 --> 24:01.040
and he's angry with the police
because we tried to fire him.

24:01.760 --> 24:02.640
But?

24:02.720 --> 24:05.880
I mean, we don't have a clear connection
between him and Elias Fager yet

24:05.960 --> 24:07.280
and no obvious motive.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.480
We don't know if he's linked
to the secret mentioned in the letters,

24:10.560 --> 24:13.040
but what we do know
is that Joel Petterson is lying

24:13.120 --> 24:15.360
about his movements
on the night of the killing.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.280
Keep an eye on him, discreetly.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.040
Do you think it's possible
to get a wiretap?

24:24.120 --> 24:26.720
Put together what you have.
I'll talk to the prosecutor.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.960
I will, sir.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.080
Good work.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.680
Thanks,
but Detective Abd Al-Rahman did it.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.040
Hey, Rask, have you found anything?

25:59.120 --> 26:00.240
<i>Yeah, maybe.</i>

26:00.760 --> 26:01.840
What do you have?

26:02.360 --> 26:04.160
One of the swimmers I talked to,

26:04.240 --> 26:07.160
she remembered a girl
that Moberg was coaching, seventh-grader.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.560
A seventh-grader?

26:09.160 --> 26:12.440
-Alexia was in the ninth grade, right?
-<i>Kid hadn't made the team yet,</i>

26:12.520 --> 26:14.520
<i>but apparently he was</i>
<i>really invested in her.</i>

26:14.600 --> 26:18.040
But it turns out this girl,
she was in Elias's class.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.680
<i>Only problem is the person I spoke to</i>
<i>can't remember her name.</i>

26:22.400 --> 26:23.760
I'm gonna look into it.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.600
<i>Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

26:26.480 --> 26:27.320
Yeah.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.480
-All right, kid. Get some sleep.
-<i>Yeah. Goodnight.</i>

26:58.240 --> 27:01.920
I asked around the estate.
Nobody saw Petterson dump the car.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.120
How's it going?

27:04.640 --> 27:06.280
Pretty much like this all day.

27:06.360 --> 27:09.320
-And the wiretap?
-Osei's working on the prosecutor.

27:09.400 --> 27:10.480
Well, you know what I think?

27:10.560 --> 27:13.040
I know you want to act now,
but we have to wait.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.800
Hard evidence. That's how we get him.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.240
-Hey, Jaz.
-<i> Kurt, hey.</i>

27:33.320 --> 27:36.600
-Do you have a minute?
-<i>Yes, of course. Is everything okay?</i>

27:37.880 --> 27:39.240
I'm worried about Rez.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.200
<i>Why? Did anything happen?</i>

27:42.560 --> 27:43.880
He's not himself.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.080
<i>Yeah, I know. I'm worried too.</i>

27:48.160 --> 27:51.120
<i>He's been so moody at home,</i>
<i>and he won't even talk to me about it.</i>

27:51.920 --> 27:54.560
<i>And you know</i>
<i>that this job is so important to him.</i>

27:56.880 --> 27:58.680
<i>I don't know what to do, Kurt.</i>

28:02.360 --> 28:04.920
Hi. My, uh… My name is Douglas Bergmark.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.320
-I'm a relative of Elias Fager.
-<i>What do you want?</i>

28:09.080 --> 28:11.560
We found
some personal letters in his flat.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.600
If you don't want them,
I'll get rid of them.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.760
<i>That's okay. You can throw them away.</i>

28:19.360 --> 28:21.280
So you do remember the letters?

28:22.920 --> 28:23.760
<i>No.</i>

28:25.600 --> 28:27.800
I know that you know something.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.000
You should tell me.

28:32.960 --> 28:33.880
Fuck!

29:49.360 --> 29:50.240
Hey.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.880
<i>Hey, Rez, where are you?</i>

29:51.960 --> 29:54.040
-I'm at Petterson's house.
-<i> What?</i>

29:54.880 --> 29:55.720
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:56.720 --> 29:58.800
<i>He got a call and drove straight here.</i>

29:58.880 --> 30:00.520
<i>I told you we have to be careful!</i>

30:00.600 --> 30:03.240
-Kurt, he's up to something.
-<i>Okay.</i>

30:03.320 --> 30:05.000
Keep your cool and your distance.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.240
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

30:07.720 --> 30:08.560
<i>Rez.</i>

30:38.080 --> 30:41.080
-Rask. You can't be here.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.440
-You're still suspended.
-I found the swimmer.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.840
-The seventh-grader Moberg was coaching.
-Not here.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.360
Look. It's Amelia Holmgren.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.800
The daughter of the Fager boys'
defense lawyer, Edwin Holmgren.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.560
-The attorney general?
-Yes.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.240
Look, I don't care if I get fired.
I have to take this to Osei.

30:57.320 --> 31:00.160
-No, no, no, I'll do it. You go home. Go.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.280
-Rez.
-Kurt. I gotta take him.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.640
-He's got a fire going.
<i>-Don't do anything.</i>

31:05.720 --> 31:08.880
-But he's burning evidence.
-Just stay where you are. I'm on my way.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.080
Rask!

31:14.040 --> 31:14.880
Rez?

31:14.960 --> 31:17.200
I'm sorry, you need
to take a look at this.

31:41.320 --> 31:42.280
Yeah?

31:42.360 --> 31:45.640
I think he's burning evidence, Kurt.
I'm going in.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.040
<i>No, Rez, stay back!</i>

31:47.120 --> 31:51.080
-I'm taking him in before it's too late!
-Don't go. That's an order, Rez!

31:53.080 --> 31:54.080
Oh sh--

32:51.560 --> 32:53.480
Rez, where's Petterson?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.040
Did he leave?

32:55.560 --> 32:56.720
Yeah, he left.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.880
Are you all right?

32:58.560 --> 33:00.160
The evidence is gone, Kurt.

33:01.560 --> 33:02.560
We need to go.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.840
I had him red-handed, Kurt.

33:05.640 --> 33:09.120
-He could've been burning anything.
-He was burning fucking evidence, Kurt!

33:09.200 --> 33:12.560
Calm down, okay?
We can't chance anything right now.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.080
Rez, we need to--

33:14.160 --> 33:16.400
You wanted to come in
like the fucking cavalry!

33:16.480 --> 33:19.760
Why would I wanna do that?
We're running an investigation here.

33:20.840 --> 33:21.760
Come on.

33:21.840 --> 33:22.760
Okay?

33:23.360 --> 33:26.480
No, don't touch me! You've been
holding me back this whole time!

33:31.480 --> 33:33.120
This isn't about you, Rez.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.200
You've made that pretty fucking clear.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.160
Rez.

34:27.000 --> 34:27.960
A detective.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.840
That's exciting.
