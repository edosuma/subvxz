00:16.125 --> 00:17.825
[Matthew] <i>Yep, check, check. Yep.</i>

00:18.250 --> 00:19.250
[Zach sighing]

00:19.375 --> 00:21.143
- [Matthew] <i>Thank you.</i>
- [Zach] <i>Sorry about the leaky pipes.</i>

00:21.167 --> 00:22.827
<i>It shouldn't affect the interview at all.</i>

00:22.917 --> 00:24.476
[Matthew] <i> You good with sound</i>
<i>and everything on that?</i>

00:24.500 --> 00:25.820
[Zach] <i>We'll take it out in post.</i>

00:27.458 --> 00:30.338
[Matthew] <i>Uh, that's just plumbing,</i>
<i>'cause it's not even raining outside.</i>

00:30.458 --> 00:32.708
- [Zach] <i>Sorry.</i>
- [bell ringing]

00:32.917 --> 00:35.497
<i>Hi, welcome to another edition</i>
<i>of </i> Between Two Ferns.

00:35.583 --> 00:37.043
<i>I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis,</i>

00:37.125 --> 00:38.825
<i>and today my guest is...</i>

00:39.583 --> 00:40.633
Matthew...

00:40.792 --> 00:41.922
McConnach...

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
McCannoway.

00:43.958 --> 00:45.208
Matthew McConnarr...

00:45.292 --> 00:46.132
[dripping continues]

00:46.208 --> 00:48.168
Matthew McConnagee. McConaughey.

00:49.625 --> 00:50.745
Good to be here, Zach.

00:51.083 --> 00:53.713
[flatly] All right, all right, all right.

00:55.375 --> 00:58.375
Sorry, I was just reading the box office
returns for your last three movies.

01:00.292 --> 01:01.332
All right.

01:01.958 --> 01:02.958
All right.

01:03.250 --> 01:04.489
I guess that one was all right.

01:06.083 --> 01:07.883
I notice that you're wearing a shirt.

01:08.417 --> 01:09.327
Is everything okay?

01:09.417 --> 01:10.537
[chuckles derisively]

01:10.917 --> 01:11.917
You fucking kidding me?

01:12.542 --> 01:14.332
Of all the things
you can win an Oscar for,

01:14.417 --> 01:16.877
how surprised are you
that you won one for acting?

01:17.625 --> 01:18.495
Here we go.

01:18.583 --> 01:20.633
But so did that guy
from <i>Thirty Seconds To Mars.</i>

01:21.292 --> 01:22.292
So, um...

01:22.375 --> 01:23.575
how proud can you really be?

01:23.667 --> 01:24.537
How much time do we have?

01:24.625 --> 01:27.059
I'm out of here in about 15 minutes,
so whatever. Do something.

01:27.083 --> 01:27.963
What do you have to do?

01:28.042 --> 01:30.672
Go drive around in a Lincoln convertible,
shirtless?

01:30.750 --> 01:31.750
Yeah.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.583
Your dad died while having sex
with your mom,

01:35.667 --> 01:37.917
and you've said that you want
to go out the same way.

01:38.542 --> 01:40.422
You and your mom need
to set up some boundaries.

01:40.458 --> 01:41.518
- No, it's not true.
- I wasn't...

01:41.542 --> 01:43.018
- Next question.
- It wasn't supposed to be funny.

01:43.042 --> 01:45.122
- It's just a rumor that I heard.
- Yeah, I hear you.

01:45.417 --> 01:48.037
Who do you think will accidentally
starve himself to death first,

01:48.125 --> 01:49.285
you or Christian Bale?

01:50.625 --> 01:52.455
You lost so much weight for that movie,

01:52.917 --> 01:55.457
I thought you might die from fake AIDS.

01:55.542 --> 01:57.252
I've got three kids, I got a wife.

01:57.333 --> 01:58.333
What have you got?

01:58.958 --> 01:59.958
Besides two ferns?

02:00.042 --> 02:02.042
[dripping intensifies]

02:03.500 --> 02:05.380
At least you're watering them, I see.

02:06.542 --> 02:07.882
Yeah, and again, I'm sorry.

02:07.958 --> 02:09.809
- We'll fix it in the edit.
- Doesn't bother me.

02:09.833 --> 02:11.833
[loud dripping in bucket]

02:11.917 --> 02:13.247
[sighing] I'm so... I'm so sorry.

02:13.458 --> 02:14.538
Can I just, uh...

02:15.792 --> 02:17.792
...see what's going on with these pipes?

02:21.083 --> 02:22.083
I got a lighter.

02:25.375 --> 02:26.575
Dude, don't do that.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.377
[fire alarm ringing]

02:31.208 --> 02:32.208
[Zach] Help!

02:35.542 --> 02:36.752
[Matthew] A little help here?

02:43.167 --> 02:44.207
[Matthew] I can't get out!

02:45.875 --> 02:49.075
[yelling] Who was the idiot
that installed the sprinkler system?

02:49.708 --> 02:52.668
- [Matthew] What's the way out, Zach?
- I don't know, Matthew!

02:52.750 --> 02:54.101
[Matthew]
Well, where did we come in from?

02:54.125 --> 02:57.125
I don't recall, Matthew,
I'm a little... stressed!

02:57.208 --> 02:59.208
[fire alarm stops ringing]

03:00.333 --> 03:02.583
[panting]
Well, they turned the sprinklers off.

03:03.042 --> 03:04.382
[both exclaiming]

03:04.958 --> 03:08.538
[theme playing]

03:24.042 --> 03:26.042
[bird chirping]

03:40.042 --> 03:41.422
[director] And... action.

03:41.583 --> 03:42.583
Hello,

03:42.833 --> 03:44.753
and welcome to <i>Behind Two Ferns,</i>

03:45.083 --> 03:46.963
the story of <i>Between Two Ferns,</i>

03:47.292 --> 03:49.082
a special feature-length documentary

03:49.167 --> 03:52.247
providing an inside glimpse
at my award-losing talk show.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.040
I'm Zach Galifianakis.

03:54.375 --> 03:55.995
We're here in Flinch, North Carolina,

03:56.208 --> 03:58.458
where I've taped my show
for over ten years.

03:59.042 --> 04:00.462
Not only do I host the show,

04:00.708 --> 04:02.168
but I will be your tour guide

04:02.417 --> 04:04.207
throughout your cinematic experience.

04:04.667 --> 04:07.627
Who knows,
maybe the movie will even be in 3D?

04:07.750 --> 04:08.790
[chuckles]

04:09.458 --> 04:11.038
Little trivia about my show,

04:11.500 --> 04:13.630
I originally wanted to call it
<i>Betwixt Two Ferns,</i>

04:13.708 --> 04:15.788
but I thought that was
too highbrow for the public.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.132
Our journey begins here,
like most classic tales,

04:21.208 --> 04:24.038
with our hero opening a door
into adventure.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.710
[director] And... cut.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.170
Great, that was the best one.

04:30.208 --> 04:31.393
Twenty-one takes is good for you?

04:31.417 --> 04:33.518
Twenty-one takes?
That's really, really good for me, yep.

04:33.542 --> 04:34.462
[director] We can move on?

04:34.542 --> 04:36.782
- Yeah, let's move on, that was perfect.
- Okay, move on!

04:37.875 --> 04:40.825
[Zach] <i>I grew up here in the small town</i>
<i>of Flinch, North Carolina,</i>

04:41.917 --> 04:43.707
<i>and ever since I was a kid, I...</i>

04:43.792 --> 04:47.462
<i>dreamed of being a big
network TV personality.</i>

04:47.542 --> 04:51.212
[studio audience laughing]

04:51.333 --> 04:53.213
[inaudible]

04:53.375 --> 04:56.375
[Zach] <i>But things haven't worked out</i>
<i>exactly as planned.</i>

04:56.833 --> 04:59.184
- [synth theme music playing]
- [announcer] <i>From Flinch, North Carolina,</i>

04:59.208 --> 05:01.828
<i>it's Flinch Public Access Television!</i>

05:02.250 --> 05:06.000
Anybody watching this show
has the ability to make a piÃ±ata.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.184
- You're lying. You didn't say that.
- The lifeblood of America.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.101
- You told me it was about waste water.
- I don't lie.

05:10.125 --> 05:12.785
I have no idea what I'd do without you.

05:12.875 --> 05:15.785
Think about soccer,
you don't even use your hands.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.212
That's what makes us human.

05:18.625 --> 05:19.915
Didn't like that card.

05:20.667 --> 05:21.867
Didn't like that card, either.

05:21.917 --> 05:23.417
Where do you keep your Oscar?

05:23.792 --> 05:24.792
I mean your, uh...

05:24.833 --> 05:26.503
Blockbuster Entertainment Award?

05:31.417 --> 05:33.247
We are here, at, uh...

05:33.750 --> 05:35.460
Flinch Public Access Television,

05:35.542 --> 05:37.422
FPAT-V, for short.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.080
<i>What's great about public access</i>

05:40.167 --> 05:41.417
<i>is the feel of community.</i>

05:41.500 --> 05:43.210
Here comes the tornado.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.535
[Zach] <i>Anybody's voice can be heard here.</i>

05:46.625 --> 05:48.125
Top that, motherfucker.

05:49.250 --> 05:52.420
[Zach] <i>This is where I've been</i>
<i>taping my shows for over a decade now.</i>

05:53.667 --> 05:54.747
- Hi.
- [receptionist] Hi!

05:54.958 --> 05:55.958
I'm, uh...

05:56.292 --> 06:00.292
Keanu Reeves and I'm here
for <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

06:00.375 --> 06:01.705
Oh, yeah.

06:01.792 --> 06:03.922
<i>[Between Two Ferns</i> theme playing]

06:05.417 --> 06:06.737
Hi, my name is Zach Galifianakis.

06:06.792 --> 06:07.952
Welcome to another edition...

06:08.500 --> 06:09.750
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

06:09.833 --> 06:12.083
Uh, my guest today is Keanu Reeves.

06:12.958 --> 06:15.288
- Thank you for being here.
<i>- </i> Thanks for having me here.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.325
You have a big scar, I hear,
from a motorcycle accident?

06:18.417 --> 06:19.707
Yeah, I do, yeah.

06:20.083 --> 06:21.083
Is it... Where is it?

06:21.125 --> 06:22.684
- Just goes from here to here.
- Big one?

06:22.708 --> 06:24.101
- God, that big?
- Yeah, it's about...

06:24.125 --> 06:27.075
I have a similar scar on my...
on my leg.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.333
From what?

06:28.542 --> 06:30.172
Walked out of the movie <i>Lake House.</i>

06:30.542 --> 06:32.832
Bumped into the seat in front of me.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.380
On a scale of one to 100,

06:36.458 --> 06:37.748
how many words do you know?

06:38.750 --> 06:39.880
One to 100?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.580
Like, do you know 50 words?

06:41.667 --> 06:42.997
Do you know 75 words?

06:43.333 --> 06:44.673
Do you know 18 words?

06:46.375 --> 06:47.375
Is it frustrating, uh...

06:47.458 --> 06:49.788
to have people think of you
as a complete bozo?

06:50.042 --> 06:51.542
When the truth is that you're just...

06:51.958 --> 06:53.788
a man with below average intelligence?

06:54.958 --> 06:55.958
Just do...

06:56.208 --> 06:57.418
one for yes, and then...

06:58.792 --> 06:59.792
two for no.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.753
Do you research your roles?

07:02.167 --> 07:03.167
Yeah.

07:03.375 --> 07:06.665
Have you ever considered researching
a character that has taken acting classes?

07:07.625 --> 07:09.455
Right now I'm acting like this is fun.

07:10.750 --> 07:11.830
How am I doing?

07:13.167 --> 07:14.287
[Zach] <i>It's a good show.</i>

07:14.375 --> 07:17.125
Right now,
it's the seventh-ranked show in, uh...

07:17.750 --> 07:20.960
southeastern North Carolina's
public access television market.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.497
I mean, do I have other dreams?

07:23.625 --> 07:25.785
I've always wanted to jet ski to Alaska.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.380
<i>But, ultimately, in life,
I'd like to have my own</i>

07:30.125 --> 07:31.165
<i>late night talk show.</i>

07:32.875 --> 07:34.125
But this, for now,

07:34.500 --> 07:35.500
what I have now...

07:37.333 --> 07:38.333
this will do.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.083
[Will] <i>Who's on cocaine?</i>

07:43.292 --> 07:45.542
I'm sorry, I thought someone said
someone's on cocaine,

07:45.625 --> 07:47.785
and I was like, "Who's on cocaine?"

07:48.333 --> 07:49.333
'Cause it's not me.

07:49.417 --> 07:50.497
[sniffing]

07:50.583 --> 07:52.633
You ready? Let's do it.
[clears throat]

07:52.792 --> 07:55.422
[director]
<i>Okay. So, how did you stumble across Zach?</i>

07:55.792 --> 07:58.172
When I, uh, first saw some...

07:58.708 --> 08:00.288
footage of...

08:00.375 --> 08:01.415
[chuckling]

08:01.583 --> 08:04.333
...this fat idiot, Zach Galifianakis,

08:04.417 --> 08:08.167
[laughing] I thought...
I thought it was a practical joke.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.420
I don't know if you wanna get
a tight shot of that?

08:10.917 --> 08:13.747
<i>America's Dumbest Television Hosts.</i>

08:13.917 --> 08:15.037
[laughing]

08:15.125 --> 08:18.245
And, uh, I saw him on this tape
and he was so...

08:18.333 --> 08:19.423
He was such an idiot,

08:19.708 --> 08:21.128
and he was so dumb,

08:21.625 --> 08:22.955
and so fat.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.253
So, uh, without asking,

08:25.958 --> 08:28.878
I uploaded it to my website, Funny Or Die,

08:29.667 --> 08:30.667
and, uh...

08:30.917 --> 08:31.917
All the clicks.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.375
Over 500 trillion and counting.

08:34.707 --> 08:36.038
And those clicks...

08:37.500 --> 08:38.789
equals more green,

08:39.500 --> 08:40.669
which equals more white,

08:40.792 --> 08:41.672
[sniffs loudly]

08:41.750 --> 08:43.080
which equals more...

08:44.792 --> 08:45.792
purple.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.415
That's me putting on a big,

08:49.292 --> 08:50.582
purple feather boa.

08:52.167 --> 08:54.007
Yeah, so, I signed him
to an exclusive contract

08:54.083 --> 08:55.293
and, you know,

08:55.875 --> 08:58.625
started forcing my Hollywood friends
to be interviewed by him.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.825
Hi, welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

09:01.917 --> 09:03.577
Uh, my guest today is...

09:04.250 --> 09:05.250
Chance the Rapper.

09:06.167 --> 09:06.997
Hi.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.963
You're an actor, a rapper, an activist.

09:09.042 --> 09:10.632
Why aren't you also an astronaut?

09:11.375 --> 09:14.415
[chuckling] Uh...
I don't know. I'm not very, uh...

09:15.708 --> 09:18.168
- like, I don't come from, uh...
- Space.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.038
Yep.

09:20.125 --> 09:22.495
If your parents had not named you
Chance the Rapper,

09:22.583 --> 09:24.743
do you think you would have
pursued a different career?

09:25.208 --> 09:27.168
My parents didn't name me
Chance the Rapper.

09:27.250 --> 09:28.330
That's a stage name.

09:28.417 --> 09:29.417
Any siblings?

09:29.792 --> 09:31.172
I have one brother, yeah.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.330
What's he do for a living?

09:32.417 --> 09:33.417
He's a rapper too.

09:33.792 --> 09:34.672
What is his name?

09:34.750 --> 09:36.210
Community Chest the Rapper?

09:37.417 --> 09:38.787
Uh, no.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.165
You're friends with Kanye West.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.292
That's the joke.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.040
I don't like that joke.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.643
[Zach] Will you just give these a chance?

09:49.667 --> 09:50.667
They're fine.

09:51.292 --> 09:52.382
This is good stuff.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.832
[whispering]
Stop fucking playing with me right now.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.809
[director] <i>So, it seems like you have</i>
<i>a lot of responsibility here.</i>

09:57.833 --> 10:00.423
I do. The show carries
a lot of responsibility,

10:00.500 --> 10:02.143
- but, you know...
- [man sighing] Oh, my God.

10:02.167 --> 10:03.877
I'm surrounded by a really good team.

10:03.958 --> 10:05.498
My office is right this way.

10:06.833 --> 10:09.633
Got a great view of everybody,
I can kinda keep an eye on things.

10:10.208 --> 10:11.418
[banging loudly]

10:13.167 --> 10:15.957
I feel sorry for people who use laptops.
[laughs]

10:16.083 --> 10:17.463
They don't get that exercise.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.133
<i>I'm Carol.</i>

10:19.208 --> 10:22.668
I am Zach's right-hand woman, yeah.

10:23.125 --> 10:24.535
He cares about his job.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.628
He's very creative.

10:26.708 --> 10:27.538
He's very clever.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.915
<i>So, I do a lot of things for him,
he's very busy, and...</i>

10:30.458 --> 10:33.288
<i>um, he just needs somebody
to take care of all the details,</i>

10:33.375 --> 10:34.875
and I'm happy to do it.

10:35.458 --> 10:37.248
Sometimes words are overwhelming for him.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.226
He needs to just
kind of break it up a little bit.

10:39.250 --> 10:42.460
Zach likes me to cut out all the big
top stories of the day from the newspaper.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.018
Just throw them in the trash
so he can just look at the pictures.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.351
I've written down lists of things

10:46.375 --> 10:48.309
that I wanted him to make sure
he remembered, and...

10:48.333 --> 10:49.963
his brain just doesn't work that way.

10:50.042 --> 10:50.882
<i>He needs it to be drawn.</i>

10:50.958 --> 10:52.708
<i>So, it'll just be a picture of him,</i>

10:53.083 --> 10:54.083
<i>in bed,</i>

10:54.125 --> 10:56.165
<i>and every step,
from removing the covers,</i>

10:56.250 --> 10:57.670
<i>standing up, walking...</i>

10:57.750 --> 10:58.880
And then after that,

10:59.208 --> 11:00.328
that's you in the car.

11:00.917 --> 11:01.827
When I leave?

11:01.917 --> 11:02.917
Yeah.

11:03.333 --> 11:04.633
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.880
<i>Zach also has me run
personal errands for him.</i>

11:07.333 --> 11:09.133
<i>For instance, he has very sensitive skin,</i>

11:09.208 --> 11:12.078
<i>and he needs to wear panty liners
to protect his private area.</i>

11:13.458 --> 11:14.788
I call her the Getter.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.330
She gets it.

11:16.417 --> 11:17.957
She gets me and she gets...

11:18.708 --> 11:19.538
guest,

11:19.625 --> 11:22.625
and she gets...
she gets things for me.

11:22.708 --> 11:23.878
So I call her the Getter.

11:24.583 --> 11:25.583
And, uh...

11:26.250 --> 11:27.080
she's wonderful.

11:27.167 --> 11:29.417
So, Zach has a thing called
"fernspection,"

11:29.500 --> 11:32.920
where he wants to make sure
that the ferns are just so,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.540
and they have to be
exactly the same in every episode.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.165
<i>He likes that continuity.</i>

11:37.708 --> 11:39.378
Green as ever. They look great.

11:41.583 --> 11:42.793
[lips smacking]

11:43.000 --> 11:44.170
Moisture's nice. Good.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.710
[electronic tape measure whirring]

11:47.958 --> 11:48.958
[Carol] Ow.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.958
- Why do they look so different?
- I don't...

11:55.042 --> 11:57.382
I don't know how to take care of these.
Keep killing them.

11:58.292 --> 12:00.012
I just buy new ones
whenever we have a show.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.309
[electronic tape measure whirring]

12:03.333 --> 12:05.333
Is the width off to you? No, that's right.

12:05.542 --> 12:06.382
Looks good.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.458
That's exactly what it was last time.

12:08.833 --> 12:11.463
[whirring]

12:12.042 --> 12:13.132
What's the readout?

12:13.208 --> 12:14.351
- I have one.
- Whoa. No, no, no.

12:14.375 --> 12:15.375
It says one.

12:15.750 --> 12:16.880
I gotta say...

12:17.417 --> 12:19.877
it's hard to believe I've used
the same ferns all these years.

12:20.583 --> 12:22.333
- Okay. So, yeah, we all set?
- [Zach] <i>Yeah.</i>

12:22.750 --> 12:23.870
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.203
- Good work. Really good work.
- [tape measure whirrs]

12:27.083 --> 12:28.723
Hey, Chuck, I wanted to talk you about...

12:29.417 --> 12:30.667
[sighs with relief]

12:31.000 --> 12:33.320
[director] <i>So, I've heard people</i>
<i>call you by your nickname.</i>

12:33.417 --> 12:34.627
<i>Can you explain what it means?</i>

12:34.792 --> 12:37.712
I'm nicknamed Cam
because it's short for Cameron.

12:37.917 --> 12:40.167
A lot of people say, like,
"No, you're nicknamed Cam

12:40.250 --> 12:43.080
because now you work with cameras,"
but that's not true.

12:43.167 --> 12:44.957
I'm probably one of the top,

12:45.417 --> 12:47.247
you know, 50...

12:47.333 --> 12:48.253
[tuba sputtering]

12:48.333 --> 12:50.503
<i>...probably top 50 cameramen
you can find.</i>

12:50.750 --> 12:52.290
[Zach] <i>I'm not crazy about him.</i>

12:52.875 --> 12:55.245
His attitude is... sloppy.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.540
I asked for an ecu of the button.

12:58.917 --> 13:00.167
[stammering] You know? And I...

13:00.292 --> 13:01.582
I didn't see your camera move.

13:01.667 --> 13:02.707
An ECU?

13:02.958 --> 13:04.128
[Cam] <i>Zach is...</i>

13:04.667 --> 13:07.327
and I'll say this
the nicest way I know how,

13:07.542 --> 13:09.292
he is an absolute piece of shit,

13:09.792 --> 13:11.252
garbage rat, loser,

13:11.625 --> 13:12.625
uh, donkey.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.748
He's the biggest piece of shit
I've met in my life

13:14.833 --> 13:16.793
and I've met some big pieces of shit.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.578
In life <i>and </i> in a toilet.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.133
I have a really good time,
and I like Zach.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.000
I think he's...
I think he's sweet.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.976
You didn't come to Cecil's birthday party.
You know, Cecil, the janitor?

13:27.000 --> 13:27.880
She's good.

13:27.958 --> 13:29.168
I like her enthusiasm.

13:29.292 --> 13:30.476
[whispering] A little annoying.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.380
We didn't have cupcakes,
'cause he's vegan now.

13:32.458 --> 13:33.658
Did you know that, he's vegan?

13:33.875 --> 13:36.915
- [Zach] No, I didn't.
- Yeah, so I got like plums and persimmons.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.130
It's fine, I mean...

13:38.250 --> 13:41.420
[whispering] That woman
fucking annoys the shit out of me.

13:42.042 --> 13:44.809
[director] So there's a lot of celebrities
passing through the studio, right?

13:44.833 --> 13:46.463
Oh, yeah, tons and tons.
Like, everybody.

13:46.542 --> 13:48.882
I feel like there's nobody
who hasn't been through here.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.768
Thank you so much
for doing this pre-interview.

13:50.792 --> 13:52.768
- [Rashida] Yeah.
- So, I heard you have a funny story.

13:52.792 --> 13:53.792
We'd love to hear it.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.633
Oh, yeah, so, basically,
I got home late from work

13:56.708 --> 13:58.498
and I was really tired and I parked...

13:58.583 --> 14:00.183
[softly] Maybe ask her what race she is.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.915
I'm not sure how that's relevant here.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.670
Okay, is there something, like,
light you wanna talk about,

14:05.750 --> 14:06.960
that's, like, something funny?

14:07.042 --> 14:08.362
I think you kind of...
It's not...

14:08.417 --> 14:09.707
It doesn't have to be like that.

14:09.875 --> 14:12.665
Yeah, like a flippant story
about being half black, half white

14:12.750 --> 14:13.750
or something like that.

14:14.750 --> 14:15.790
Hi, I'm Zach.

14:15.875 --> 14:18.495
- Hey, Adam, from <i>Parks and Recreation.</i>
- Oh, God.

14:18.917 --> 14:20.127
That is refreshing to hear.

14:20.625 --> 14:24.075
I'm so used to interviewing dumb actors
with their dumb actor lifestyles and stuff

14:24.167 --> 14:25.887
so it's nice to interview
real people and...

14:25.917 --> 14:28.577
Sorry, the TV show <i>Parks and Recreation.</i>

14:30.250 --> 14:32.540
[sighing] Okay. Let's get you miked up.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.125
Great.

14:34.292 --> 14:35.882
What temperature was it in there?

14:35.958 --> 14:38.198
- It's hard for me to concentrate...
- You like swimming?

14:39.208 --> 14:40.208
Yeah?

14:40.542 --> 14:42.382
I got a lot of bathing suits in my car.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.828
Turning down a celebrity

14:45.167 --> 14:48.997
is maybe the greatest joy
a person can have.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.083
Can I get a plum?

14:50.125 --> 14:51.955
- Yes, of course. How are you?
- [giggling]

14:52.042 --> 14:53.422
Not gonna happen, champ.

14:57.417 --> 14:58.877
[Shirl] <i>Zach, he's always around,</i>

14:58.958 --> 15:01.328
he pretends that he needs
to be here all the time.

15:01.542 --> 15:03.332
He keeps taking stuff from the shelf.

15:03.417 --> 15:04.957
I know he does.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.670
My name is Shirl Clarts,

15:07.750 --> 15:09.880
S-H-I-R-L C-L-A-R-T-S.

15:10.667 --> 15:12.976
- [director] <i>And what do you do here?</i>
- I'm the station manager.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.290
I run this whole deal.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.125
You know what a lion is?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.458
A lion is a strong animal.

15:18.958 --> 15:21.168
They do what the fuck they wanna do.

15:21.333 --> 15:24.833
Take what they want, eat what they want,
they run when they feel like it.

15:24.917 --> 15:26.127
Lion.

15:26.417 --> 15:28.247
And then Bobby...

15:29.583 --> 15:31.083
is the assistant manager,

15:31.167 --> 15:32.957
and he's worked here
for a long time, too.

15:33.042 --> 15:34.042
Put me on speaker.

15:34.708 --> 15:35.788
Put me on speaker.

15:36.875 --> 15:37.875
Put me on speaker now.

15:38.958 --> 15:40.878
- Should I come back?
- Diane!

15:42.292 --> 15:43.422
Hey, Diane!

15:44.042 --> 15:45.042
Am I on speaker?

15:45.917 --> 15:47.247
- I'll come back.
- No, come in.

15:47.667 --> 15:48.667
Am I on speaker?

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
All right, good.

15:50.667 --> 15:51.497
Love you, bye.

15:51.583 --> 15:52.423
Come in.

15:52.583 --> 15:53.583
What's up?

15:54.250 --> 15:56.830
Did you take my Hamburger Helper boxes
out of the break room?

15:56.917 --> 15:59.417
- What if I did?
- I want my Hamburger Helper boxes back!

15:59.500 --> 16:00.934
[Bobby] <i>All right.</i>
<i>I'll just write a check for you.</i>

16:00.958 --> 16:02.748
They're, like, $1.15 each.

16:02.833 --> 16:03.883
Well, there was two boxes.

16:03.958 --> 16:05.498
All right, so, 3.50?

16:09.500 --> 16:10.630
[Zach] <i>Hey!</i>

16:11.458 --> 16:12.458
Where are you going?

16:12.500 --> 16:13.620
[director] <i>We're going home.</i>

16:13.667 --> 16:15.577
[Zach] No, you have to film at all times.

16:15.667 --> 16:18.127
If I say, "Cut,"
that means keep the camera rolling.

16:18.208 --> 16:20.038
If I say,
"Get that camera out of my face,"

16:20.625 --> 16:22.205
put that camera in my face.

16:22.750 --> 16:23.750
Okay?

16:23.958 --> 16:25.226
Let's do it again, from the top.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.143
You wanna do this conversation again
from the top?

16:27.167 --> 16:30.037
Yeah, this is my life story.
You ruined that scene of my life story.

16:31.042 --> 16:33.082
So did you, by the way.
Let's take it from the top.

16:36.417 --> 16:37.707
[stilted] Where are you going?

16:37.792 --> 16:39.172
I'm going home.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.918
- That's bad acting. Bad acting.
- I don't buy it.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.250
Welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

16:45.333 --> 16:46.793
I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis,

16:46.875 --> 16:49.125
and my guest today is...

16:49.792 --> 16:50.792
Brie Larson.

16:51.292 --> 16:52.292
Thank you, Brie.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.498
You won Best Actress.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.753
Have you ever thought of aiming higher
and trying to win Best Actor?

16:59.583 --> 17:00.583
Um...

17:00.875 --> 17:02.495
- I... Yeah...
- Good question.

17:02.583 --> 17:04.463
It is good. It's thought-provoking.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.041
Your superhero character
is called Captain Marvel.

17:07.125 --> 17:08.125
Yes.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.500
Boy, they really have stopped trying,
haven't they?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.380
I mean, why don't they call it
Captain Comic Book,

17:13.541 --> 17:15.922
or Captain We Can't Think
Of Anything Else?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.750
And what would your superhero name be?

17:17.833 --> 17:18.883
Cap'n Crunch?

17:20.708 --> 17:23.167
I read online that you're very private
and decline to answer

17:23.250 --> 17:25.040
questions that make you
feel uncomfortable.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.875
This is a two-parter.
[clears throat]

17:26.958 --> 17:27.828
Is that true?

17:27.916 --> 17:30.207
And how old were you
when you got your first period?

17:31.667 --> 17:35.287
His show's success
is absolutely predicated on the fact

17:35.375 --> 17:37.325
that people are laughing <i>at </i> him,

17:37.583 --> 17:38.583
not with him.

17:38.667 --> 17:39.497
[crunching]

17:39.583 --> 17:42.083
[Will] <i>I think it's utterly fascinating</i>

17:42.208 --> 17:44.958
<i>that someone that grotesque</i>

17:45.042 --> 17:47.422
<i>can actually be watchable.</i>

17:47.542 --> 17:48.962
[gulping]

17:49.458 --> 17:50.288
Hmm.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.455
- [jackhammer pounding]
- [men yelling]

17:52.583 --> 17:53.673
What is all this?

17:57.667 --> 18:00.077
[truck back-up beeper sounding]

18:07.042 --> 18:08.042
Carol!

18:10.250 --> 18:12.170
- What's going on out here?
- [receptionist] Huh?

18:12.417 --> 18:13.577
What is going on?

18:13.708 --> 18:15.168
Something's going on with the pipes.

18:15.708 --> 18:17.101
- Yeah, no kidding.
- [water dripping]

18:17.125 --> 18:19.075
What we have here is the perfect storm.

18:19.167 --> 18:21.327
Old pipes, water line blockage.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.130
And, for some weird reason,

18:23.208 --> 18:24.788
someone shoved

18:24.875 --> 18:28.075
a whole bunch
of shit-stained panty liners

18:28.292 --> 18:29.542
down your commodes.

18:29.625 --> 18:30.495
- [all groaning]
- Come on, man!

18:30.583 --> 18:32.963
This blockage is so major,
it could blow at any time.

18:33.042 --> 18:34.882
Whoever did this is gonna pay for it.

18:34.958 --> 18:36.518
- [woman] Oh, disgusting!
- [person gagging]

18:36.542 --> 18:37.382
[Boom Boom] Oh, God!

18:37.458 --> 18:40.078
Zach, it's too noisy with the plumbing
and the construction.

18:40.167 --> 18:41.559
We're not gonna be able
to interview the guest...

18:41.583 --> 18:43.923
This whole place
needs to be soundproof, okay?

18:44.083 --> 18:47.333
Every nook and cranny, Laura and Danny.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.167
- I want everything peepless, okay?
- [construction noises]

18:50.250 --> 18:51.250
Just do it!

[suspenseful music playing]

19:05.708 --> 19:07.168
I mean, I would, I just...

19:07.375 --> 19:09.325
I watch <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
with my roommate on...

19:09.417 --> 19:11.417
- You what?
- I'm watching TV tonight, so...

19:11.500 --> 19:13.580
- I would, but I can't tonight, sorry.
- [laughing]

19:13.708 --> 19:14.998
But, thank you.

19:17.292 --> 19:19.462
- Hey, Matthew. Zach.
- McConaughey, nice to meet you.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.542
- Nice to see you.
- Thanks so much for joining us.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.333
[exhales]

19:32.042 --> 19:33.462
[Zach sighing]

19:34.167 --> 19:36.184
- The interview should be nice and easy.
- [loud constant dripping]

19:36.208 --> 19:38.458
Thanks so much for...
This'll be nice and short.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.333
Are you ready to start?

19:40.375 --> 19:41.995
You have a major leak in here.

19:42.375 --> 19:44.735
- Everything all right there? Okay.
- No, everything's fine.

19:55.917 --> 19:57.787
[bell ringing]

19:57.875 --> 19:59.325
[loud splashing]

19:59.417 --> 20:00.917

20:03.000 --> 20:03.880
[Carol] Oh, God!

20:03.958 --> 20:05.518
[Bobby] Look out!
Gotta get out of here.

20:06.458 --> 20:07.918
[panting]

20:10.375 --> 20:11.455
[Carol screams]

20:12.917 --> 20:13.747
[knocking]

20:13.875 --> 20:14.875
[Carol] Oh, God!

20:15.208 --> 20:16.208
Oh, my God.

20:16.792 --> 20:17.792
Oh, no.

20:20.583 --> 20:22.673
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.165
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

[Zach] My ferns!

20:45.500 --> 20:46.670
What happened?

20:46.750 --> 20:47.960
My glasses!

20:49.167 --> 20:50.287
Thank God I found you!

[loud sobbing continues]

21:05.042 --> 21:06.042
Ah!

21:06.125 --> 21:10.415
[Zach wailing]

21:14.292 --> 21:16.172
I got a call from Will Ferrell
this morning.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.380
He's very upset.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.290
And he said to stand outside
of this station

21:20.375 --> 21:22.285
and be outside at 3:00 p.m.

21:22.375 --> 21:23.375
Is it 3:00?

21:23.417 --> 21:24.577

Inside.

22:03.458 --> 22:05.458
- Hey, look at this, okay?
- [machine clicking]

22:05.917 --> 22:07.327
These are my clicks.

22:07.417 --> 22:09.787
My website runs on clicks.

22:09.875 --> 22:11.075
Can you see that?

22:11.167 --> 22:12.377
It's a lot of clicks, Will.

22:12.458 --> 22:15.078
Or is the fat
drooping off your eyebrows

22:15.250 --> 22:16.710
impairing your vision?

22:18.125 --> 22:20.415
Besides, you killed Matthew McConaughey.

22:21.292 --> 22:22.292
He's dead?

22:22.542 --> 22:25.962
Well, they administered CPR to him,
and he...

22:26.583 --> 22:27.963
he's brought back to life.

22:28.042 --> 22:31.172
But... but yeah, he was,
he was momentarily dead.

22:31.417 --> 22:32.827
You are a murderer.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.497
It was a temporary murder, if it was...

22:34.583 --> 22:35.833
It was not a murder!

22:35.917 --> 22:37.627
Fine. I'll keep your secret.

22:37.875 --> 22:39.285
Okay? But you owe me.

22:40.083 --> 22:41.083
Owe you what?

22:41.292 --> 22:44.002
Ten episodes
of <i>Between Two Ferns, </i> all right?

22:44.333 --> 22:45.893
And I need them three weeks from today.

22:46.958 --> 22:49.378
No. Hold on,
let's make this interesting.

22:50.708 --> 22:52.168
How about two weeks from today?

22:53.125 --> 22:53.955
9:00 a.m.

22:54.042 --> 22:55.962
How? I can't film here anymore.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.292
You're just going to have to go
to the celebrities,

22:58.667 --> 23:00.127
wherever you can find them

23:00.333 --> 23:01.503
across the country.

23:01.583 --> 23:03.583
But what do I get in return, Mr. Ferrell?

23:03.667 --> 23:05.327
You'll be showered in...

23:05.958 --> 23:08.788
gold, and spices, and rare gems,

23:09.208 --> 23:10.668
rubies and emeralds.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.290
But I don't want that stuff.

23:12.583 --> 23:15.633
If money is not
the treasure that you desire,

23:15.708 --> 23:17.248
then say it.

23:20.458 --> 23:21.958
What doth...

23:22.875 --> 23:23.875
thy...

23:24.875 --> 23:25.875
envision?

23:26.958 --> 23:28.378
I want my own network talk show.

23:29.042 --> 23:30.132
Five nights a week.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.328
With an "Applause" sign and an audience.

23:33.583 --> 23:35.793
I want people to laugh <i>with </i> me,

23:35.958 --> 23:36.958
not <i>at </i> me.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.707
Fulfill the contract,

23:41.417 --> 23:42.417
you got a deal.

23:42.667 --> 23:45.377
Ten of your dumb internet talk show

23:45.833 --> 23:48.583
and you give me
a lifetime network talk show

23:48.667 --> 23:49.747
Lifetime?

23:49.833 --> 23:52.713
I'm a white man and I'm straight,
I deserve it.

23:53.917 --> 23:56.997
Fine. Your own talk show
on the Lifetime network.

23:58.208 --> 23:59.208
I'd take it.

23:59.958 --> 24:00.998
I'd just take it now.

24:01.833 --> 24:03.003
- Done.
- Done.

24:09.792 --> 24:10.792
I don't...

24:11.292 --> 24:12.132
Please bow.

24:12.208 --> 24:13.208
Are you...

24:15.250 --> 24:16.080
I christen thee...

24:16.167 --> 24:17.527
[Zach] This is not a thing you do.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.575
[Will] ...worthy of the mantle
that is FOD.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.922
Go on, young, pudgy Zach Galifianakis.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.170
Ride your imaginary steed

24:32.750 --> 24:33.790

24:34.125 --> 24:35.955
as America.

24:58.667 --> 24:59.707
[Zach] Let's go!

25:00.250 --> 25:01.750
Not in the front! Go around.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.627
- [Carol squealing]
- [man] Hey, watch it!

25:05.208 --> 25:06.708
[tires screeching]

25:07.083 --> 25:10.503
Okay, guys,
Mr. Will Ferrell has promised

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
all of us

25:13.667 --> 25:14.667
a new...

25:14.917 --> 25:17.627
night-time network talk show.

25:17.792 --> 25:20.082
[Boom Boom]
<i>Whoa, he wants us all to work on it?</i>

25:20.167 --> 25:21.247
Will Ferrell said this?

25:21.333 --> 25:23.043
[Zach] <i>Yep, he asked for you all by name,</i>

25:23.125 --> 25:25.285
<i>and he decided to pay for our entire trip.</i>

25:25.375 --> 25:27.955
So, let's go out
and film some celebrities!

25:28.042 --> 25:28.962
Who?

25:29.042 --> 25:30.332
I'm not quite sure yet.

25:30.750 --> 25:32.920
- Carol's looking into that and as soon...
- I am?

25:33.000 --> 25:34.760
She didn't even know
what we were doing here,

25:34.792 --> 25:36.072
she's not looking into anything!

25:36.125 --> 25:37.035
I'll start now.

25:37.125 --> 25:38.915
She's fully aware of what's going on, Cam.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.143
It's actually better that you don't know
what's going on.

25:41.167 --> 25:44.627
Just point your camera
and shut the fuck up.

25:45.417 --> 25:47.787
That's a nice thing to hear
as you're getting kidnapped.

25:49.125 --> 25:50.575
[Carol] And how long is this trip?

25:51.083 --> 25:53.503
The trip should take us just two...

25:53.750 --> 25:54.580
just two weeks.

25:54.667 --> 25:55.851
- [Carol] Two weeks?
- [Boom Boom] Wait, two weeks?

25:55.875 --> 25:59.325
To get to the big time,
you gotta be a chance-taker.

25:59.417 --> 26:00.707
<i>And I am a chance-taker.</i>

26:00.792 --> 26:03.042
We're taking <i>Between Two Ferns</i>
on the road!

26:03.458 --> 26:05.578
Oh! Hey, Zach?

26:06.083 --> 26:07.423
Think I found someone.

26:08.625 --> 26:10.145
- Oh, good!
- They're three hours away.

26:10.583 --> 26:11.833
- No kidding?
- Yep.

26:11.917 --> 26:12.917
Who is it?

26:15.750 --> 26:16.960
[Zach clears throat]

26:21.625 --> 26:24.125
Hi, welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

26:24.208 --> 26:25.788
I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis.

26:26.583 --> 26:29.383
My guess today is
Santa Claus with an eating disorder.

26:30.792 --> 26:31.632
You look good.

26:31.708 --> 26:32.788
Thanks, so do you.

26:32.917 --> 26:34.827
Did you just wake up from a 15-year nap?

26:36.333 --> 26:38.253
You look like Steve Jobs now.

26:39.333 --> 26:40.333
Okay.

26:40.792 --> 26:43.632
Your Netflix show is called
<i>My Next Guest Needs No Introduction.</i>

26:43.875 --> 26:47.125
Wouldn't a better title be
<i>My Next Show Will Have No Viewers?</i>

26:48.417 --> 26:50.627
Yeah, that... we considered that.

26:50.708 --> 26:52.038
And that didn't test well?

26:52.500 --> 26:53.920
Oh, I think it tested very well,

26:54.000 --> 26:55.670
but it hurt my feelings.

26:56.042 --> 26:57.832
Tell me about your long beard.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.667
Is that a Stupid Human Trick?

26:59.750 --> 27:02.210
Is it <i>Between Two Ferns</i>
or <i>Between the Ferns?</i>

27:02.292 --> 27:03.502
<i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

27:03.583 --> 27:05.083
Yeah, but that's apparent.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.247
Your show was on late.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.833
Everybody knew it was late.
It was dark outside.

27:08.917 --> 27:10.226
Why did they call it the <i>Late Show</i>

27:10.250 --> 27:11.559
- or whatever they call it?
- Mmm.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.503
If you're going to get nitpicky
with titles of...

27:13.542 --> 27:14.542
I'm just saying,

27:14.792 --> 27:16.002
<i>Between the Ferns,</i> yes.

27:16.083 --> 27:17.883
<i>Between Two Ferns, </i> oh!

27:18.000 --> 27:19.790
One day you might go crazy
and add a third.

27:19.875 --> 27:21.205
Then what are you going to do?

27:22.667 --> 27:24.187
- I haven't thought about that.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

27:24.625 --> 27:25.995
Plenty you haven't thought about.

27:27.208 --> 27:28.378
Your son's name is Harry.

27:28.458 --> 27:30.038
Did you name him after your face?

27:30.833 --> 27:33.253
Named him after my late father.

27:34.625 --> 27:35.745
How do you feel now?

27:35.917 --> 27:38.309
Well, I didn't know it was gonna go
into a bummer story like that.

27:38.333 --> 27:39.173
No, I know.

27:39.250 --> 27:42.790
But you don't have the capacity
for any sort of empathy or embarrassment.

27:43.250 --> 27:45.540
<i>Can you take some constructive criticism?</i>

27:47.083 --> 27:47.923
Yeah.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.460
People find you unpleasant.

27:50.167 --> 27:51.247
Mm. Thank you.

27:53.333 --> 27:55.173
You love fast cars.

27:55.542 --> 27:57.502
In what other ways is your penis small?

27:57.583 --> 27:59.793
Can I just say something about this?

28:00.208 --> 28:02.918
Not once has anyone discussed with me

28:03.250 --> 28:05.880
my penis, my size of my penis,

28:06.000 --> 28:07.540
my use of my penis,

28:07.917 --> 28:08.957
or my testicles.

28:09.042 --> 28:12.002
So, I'm just curious
about the pathology behind this.

28:12.083 --> 28:13.101
[Cam, whispering] <i>Jesus Christ.</i>

28:13.125 --> 28:14.125
[Zach] <i>What?</i>

28:15.583 --> 28:16.583
What'd you say?

28:16.750 --> 28:18.080
I said, "Jesus Christ."

28:18.167 --> 28:20.787
[Zach] Stop talk...
Do not editorialize right now, please.

28:20.875 --> 28:24.205
It's hard not to let it out
when it's such a stupid thing you said.

28:26.583 --> 28:28.934
It was a lot of fun, really.
Seriously. Thank you very much.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.601
- Thank you.
- I know you gotta run, so, thanks.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.495
Yeah, thank you.
I just wanted to say that...

28:33.667 --> 28:35.997
you know, this has been
a real inspiration to me...

28:36.083 --> 28:38.583
- ...'cause I want my own talk show.
- Good. Good. Great.

28:38.667 --> 28:41.768
Nightly talk show, 'cause I think that'll
make me happy, like it made you happy.

28:41.792 --> 28:43.582
[laughing]

28:43.667 --> 28:44.787
Yeah, I'm sure it will.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.205
Good luck on that.

28:48.042 --> 28:49.292
- Okay.
- Make you happy!

28:49.375 --> 28:51.285
- Right?
- [chuckling] Yeah!

28:51.708 --> 28:52.748
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:52.833 --> 28:53.673
All right.

28:53.792 --> 28:55.934
- Thank you very much for your time.
- Which way do I go?

28:55.958 --> 28:57.328
Right up there, where the guy is.

28:58.500 --> 28:59.500
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

28:59.750 --> 29:00.790
Okay. Bye-bye.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.543
Try to stay off the grass.

29:03.833 --> 29:05.893
- We're... in the grass.
- Thank you. All right, bye-bye.

29:05.917 --> 29:07.577
Bye-bye. Take care.

29:09.125 --> 29:10.125
[Carol] <i>Whoa.</i>

29:11.292 --> 29:12.832
- Hello.
- [Boom Boom] <i>What?</i>

29:14.417 --> 29:15.417
What?

29:15.500 --> 29:17.460
Okay, what's going on?

29:17.708 --> 29:20.828
Are you gonna, like, make us all
smoosh in one shitty little room?

29:20.917 --> 29:22.357
No, Cam, no one would room with you.

29:22.417 --> 29:23.417
[clerk] <i>Good afternoon.</i>

29:23.708 --> 29:25.498
Four rooms, please.

29:26.750 --> 29:28.101
- Four rooms?
- Four separate rooms.

29:28.125 --> 29:29.035
One...

29:29.125 --> 29:30.925
- [Cam] We each getting our own room?
- Two...

29:31.250 --> 29:32.130
three, and four.

29:32.208 --> 29:33.828
- We each get our own room!
- Nice!

29:33.917 --> 29:34.747
That's nice.

29:34.833 --> 29:35.673
[locks beeping]

29:35.750 --> 29:36.790
- Goodnight.
- Night.

29:40.042 --> 29:41.132
[lock buzzing]

29:42.667 --> 29:43.667
[Zach] God...

29:44.250 --> 29:45.250
Carol!

29:47.208 --> 29:49.393
Thanks so much for doing the show.
What are you doing in town?

29:49.417 --> 29:51.497
Oh, I'm here working, uh,

29:52.042 --> 29:53.252
on my foundation.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.133
- [sighing] What is it?
- Bones For Kids.

29:56.208 --> 29:58.498
It's for kids that are born
without bones.

29:58.583 --> 30:00.173
- God, that's terrible.
- I know.

30:00.625 --> 30:01.625
How can I help?

30:01.708 --> 30:04.538
You probably could stand
to donate some arm bones.

30:04.625 --> 30:06.025
You don't need all those arm bones.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.000
This one you can keep.

30:08.083 --> 30:09.543
This one you can keep.

30:09.625 --> 30:10.875
But, for some child,

30:11.167 --> 30:12.247
that's a shin.

30:12.625 --> 30:13.625
Hmm.

30:15.167 --> 30:16.747
It seems like a bogus, like...

30:18.000 --> 30:20.210
it's like a bogus charity thing,

30:20.292 --> 30:21.712
kids without boners... Bones!

30:21.833 --> 30:23.133
Without bones or something.

30:24.875 --> 30:26.555
Why were you putting a paper up to your...

30:26.792 --> 30:28.462
- I could totally hear you.
- Quiet.

30:28.750 --> 30:31.880
Hi, welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

30:32.208 --> 30:33.378
My guest today

30:33.958 --> 30:34.958
is Paul Rudd.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.502
- Thank you, Paul.
- Thank you.

30:37.542 --> 30:38.792
Some people have it all.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.630
Looks, talent.

30:41.708 --> 30:43.248
How does it feel to only have looks?

30:44.583 --> 30:45.583
Great.

30:45.625 --> 30:47.285
If you didn't look the way you do,

30:47.375 --> 30:49.559
instead of acting,
what do you think you would be doing?

30:49.583 --> 30:50.583
Shoveling shit?

30:52.083 --> 30:53.403
I read that you might quit acting

30:53.458 --> 30:54.538
and just disappear?

30:55.708 --> 30:56.788
Where did you read that?

30:57.667 --> 30:59.167
Right here. I wrote it down.

31:00.667 --> 31:01.537
Which do you prefer,

31:01.625 --> 31:02.535
being in Marvel movies,

31:02.625 --> 31:04.915
or being in stuff
that nobody has ever heard of?

31:06.458 --> 31:07.788
Uh, being in Marvel movies.

31:07.875 --> 31:09.455
Do you go to your acting coach and go,

31:09.542 --> 31:12.132
"I've gotta play a goddamn ant,
what am I supposed to do?"

31:12.208 --> 31:13.708
You lost me at "acting coach."

31:14.167 --> 31:15.627
Yeah, that seems about right.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.332
What advice would you give
to a young actor

31:18.417 --> 31:20.787
who wants to hide his Jewishness
as well as you have?

31:20.875 --> 31:23.075
But I've never really tried
to hide my Jewishness.

31:23.167 --> 31:26.077
[nasally] "I've really never tried
to hide my Jewishness."

31:26.667 --> 31:27.577
Yeah.

31:27.667 --> 31:29.957
Jesus was Jewish and he didn't hide it.

31:30.375 --> 31:33.285
No, he put it out there
for everybody to see.

31:33.375 --> 31:35.205
He's one of our best.

31:35.292 --> 31:37.082
- Are you practicing?
<i>- No.</i>

31:37.500 --> 31:38.830
I'm not a practicing Jew.

31:40.417 --> 31:41.497
I perfected it.

31:49.708 --> 31:50.828
- [Carol] <i>Zach?</i>
- Yeah?

31:51.708 --> 31:52.878
<i>Some bad news.</i>

31:54.000 --> 31:55.710
Jake Gyllenhaal had to cancel.

31:55.792 --> 31:56.792
Why?

31:56.833 --> 31:58.753
He spelled his name wrong
on his plane ticket.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.208
What?

32:00.542 --> 32:01.672
It's too many As.

32:03.417 --> 32:04.577
[sighing]

32:05.500 --> 32:07.710
- I don't know what to do.
- Ah! Oh, my God! Zach!

32:07.833 --> 32:09.753
Look over there! That's Chrissy Teigen!

32:10.167 --> 32:11.417
She's a supermodel.

32:11.500 --> 32:12.500
How super?

32:12.750 --> 32:14.210
She's married to John Legend.

32:19.917 --> 32:21.327
Go talk to her. You have to.

32:21.417 --> 32:22.417
- I can't.
- Get up!

32:22.458 --> 32:23.458
[Zach sighing]

32:23.875 --> 32:24.955
[Carol] Go! Go!

32:25.625 --> 32:26.625
Okay.

32:30.750 --> 32:31.750
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:32.792 --> 32:34.542
Another Brandy Alexander, please.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.245
- Hello.
- Oh, my God, I know you!

32:40.333 --> 32:41.583
- You do?
- Oh, my God.

32:41.667 --> 32:43.377
You are the <i>Between Two Ferns</i> guy.

32:43.458 --> 32:44.918
I love your show.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
You've seen my show?

32:46.292 --> 32:48.412
Yes, I've seen it, everybody's seen it.
It's so funny.

32:48.833 --> 32:50.333
<i>You are so...</i>

32:50.750 --> 32:51.750
uncomfortable,

32:51.792 --> 32:53.582
and weird, and awkward,

32:53.667 --> 32:55.957
<i>and all your guests,
like, you can tell they hate it,</i>

32:56.042 --> 32:57.122
<i>- but they're there!</i>
- Yeah.

32:57.500 --> 33:00.000
- I love it.
<i>- Not really what I'm going for, but...</i>

33:00.458 --> 33:02.248
<i>- Sorry.</i> [chuckles]
- That's okay.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.380
Can I ask you a question?

33:05.458 --> 33:06.288
Shoot.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.875
How did you get started?

33:08.583 --> 33:10.673
How did you become...

33:10.750 --> 33:12.130
<i>Everyone always asks me that,</i>

33:12.250 --> 33:13.880
<i>and it's actually a really funny story.</i>

33:13.958 --> 33:15.628
So, it's 2003,

33:15.708 --> 33:18.418
this guy shows up at my door
with this box,

33:18.500 --> 33:21.380
and there's this button inside,
and he says, "If you push this button,

33:21.708 --> 33:23.788
- your greatest dream will come true...
- Hmm.

33:23.875 --> 33:26.325
...but somebody, somewhere, will die."

33:27.042 --> 33:28.632
And so, I pushed it,

33:28.833 --> 33:30.043
Mister Rogers died...

33:30.125 --> 33:31.495
- What?
<i>- ...and here I am.</i>

33:32.708 --> 33:34.601
Wait, because you pushed the button,
you think that's...

33:34.625 --> 33:36.375
I mean, he had a good life, so...

33:39.167 --> 33:41.377
- I had a guest that dropped out...
- Mm-hmm.

33:41.833 --> 33:43.423
...just last-minute for my talk show.

33:43.500 --> 33:46.420
Is there anyway I can interview you?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.880
I actually have a better idea.

33:54.583 --> 33:55.883
You're touching my hand.

33:56.542 --> 33:57.382
<i>Listen...</i>

33:57.458 --> 34:00.078
what if we take this upstairs?

34:01.417 --> 34:03.077
[whispering]
What about John Legend?

34:03.167 --> 34:06.667
[chuckles] He's fine, he's probably
at home polishing his EGOT.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.170
Is that what he calls his penis?

34:09.250 --> 34:12.000
[smooth jazz playing]

34:20.167 --> 34:21.167
Come on.

34:33.958 --> 34:35.248
That was at my hotel room.

34:35.333 --> 34:36.503
How did you get that footage?

34:36.583 --> 34:37.882
There are cameras everywhere.

34:37.958 --> 34:39.498
You told me to never stop filming.

34:39.875 --> 34:42.955
This whole trip, you've been filming me
in every hotel room that I've been in?

34:43.417 --> 34:44.417
Yes.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.540
Right. This is not in the documentary.

34:48.958 --> 34:49.958
Right?

34:51.167 --> 34:52.167
At all.

34:53.167 --> 34:54.206
Destroy it.

34:55.125 --> 34:56.125
Now.

34:56.375 --> 34:58.415
But before you do,
will you email me that?

35:04.333 --> 35:06.853
[waiter] <i>Hey, guys, welcome</i>
<i>to The Bear Pit. We cook with wood.</i>

35:06.958 --> 35:09.168
Can I get you some honey gushers to start?

35:09.458 --> 35:10.458
What are honey gushers?

35:10.500 --> 35:11.500
It's just lemonade.

35:11.958 --> 35:13.038
Wow, you really sell it.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.170
Just telling it like it is.
[laughs dryly]

35:15.250 --> 35:16.920
I'll take the fried chicken plate.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.460
I'll get pork ribs.

35:18.542 --> 35:20.309
- I want the special. I want...
- [waiter] <i> Special.</i>

35:20.333 --> 35:22.043
- Do you have sushi?
<i>- I could...</i>

35:22.125 --> 35:24.915
put some fish sticks
on a rice pilaf, I guess?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.960
That's fine. Side of gravy.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.684
Good enough.
I'll be right back with that, guys.

35:28.708 --> 35:30.601
- Thank you so much for your patience.
- [Zach] <i>And your name is?</i>

35:30.625 --> 35:32.143
- My name is Mike.
- [Carol] <i>Thanks, Mike.</i>

35:32.167 --> 35:34.087
- Thanks, Mike.
- [Mike] <i>You can call me Michael.</i>

35:34.417 --> 35:35.417
Thanks, Mike.

35:35.583 --> 35:37.173
[Carol] That's great, actually. Wow.

35:37.625 --> 35:39.625
- We're gonna go to the bathroom.
- Does he really?

35:39.833 --> 35:40.883
[laughing] Okay!

35:40.958 --> 35:41.958
Thank you so much.

35:43.125 --> 35:43.995
We got a celebrity!

35:44.083 --> 35:45.083
Oh, good!

35:45.583 --> 35:46.583
John Legend!

35:47.708 --> 35:49.078
Oh, I'm so excited!

35:49.375 --> 35:50.375
The...

35:50.625 --> 35:52.535
[Carol] Yes, the piano man, yeah!

35:52.625 --> 35:54.726
He just called his manager out of the blue
this morning and was like,

35:54.750 --> 35:57.500
"I wanna be on that show,"
and he's on a plane right now flying here.

35:57.917 --> 35:58.917
- Right now?
- Yes.

35:59.083 --> 36:00.083
- Here?
<i>- He's rushed.</i>

36:00.375 --> 36:03.875
Honestly, I've never heard someone
sound so excited to do our show.

36:05.875 --> 36:08.875
[Zach] Okay. Yeah, so...
when is he coming?

36:08.958 --> 36:10.809
- He's gonna be here in a second.
- Where is he? Where is he though?

36:10.833 --> 36:12.713
His team said he was minutes away.

36:12.833 --> 36:14.268
There's a chance
I might leave during the interview.

36:14.292 --> 36:15.632
- [John] Zach!
- What?

36:16.875 --> 36:17.875
Hi.

36:21.458 --> 36:22.668
How are you, buddy?

36:22.917 --> 36:24.537
So good to see you, man.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.333
I'm so excited to be here.

36:26.625 --> 36:27.625
Oh, good.

36:28.167 --> 36:29.877
- Yeah, have... have a seat.
- Yeah.

36:30.125 --> 36:30.995
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:31.083 --> 36:31.923
Okay.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.250
Oh! I've been wanting
to be on your show for so long.

36:35.333 --> 36:36.973
I've been talking to my manager about it.

36:37.042 --> 36:39.059
- I'm so excited to be here.
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.383
Is everything okay, Zach?

36:40.542 --> 36:41.934
Yeah, everything's... everything's fine,

36:41.958 --> 36:45.288
I just get the pre-jo shitters sometime...
Uh, pre-show jitters sometimes.

36:45.708 --> 36:46.708
Okay.

36:47.833 --> 36:52.133
Hi, uh, welcome to another, uh,
edition of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

36:52.208 --> 36:53.828
I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis,

36:53.917 --> 36:55.037
and my guest today

36:55.500 --> 36:56.500
is John Legend.

36:56.583 --> 36:58.213
- Hey, Zach!
- Hey, John.

36:58.708 --> 37:00.458
Can I get an autograph for my mom?

37:00.542 --> 37:01.672
Sure, no problem.

37:01.750 --> 37:04.040
- Because she wants to give it to her mom.
- Okay.

37:04.792 --> 37:06.042
Grandmas are great, too.

37:06.792 --> 37:07.792
[exhaling nervously]

37:08.417 --> 37:09.497
Are you okay with all this?

37:09.583 --> 37:10.833
I'm so okay with it.

37:11.458 --> 37:12.748
I'm having such a great time!

37:12.833 --> 37:13.833
Are you having fun?

37:16.792 --> 37:18.672
We have something in common, uh...

37:18.750 --> 37:21.170
which is we both
love to tickle the ivories.

37:21.250 --> 37:23.351
You play the piano
and I love to make white people laugh.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.455
[John guffaws]

37:24.917 --> 37:25.787
You're great!

37:25.875 --> 37:26.875
[laughs]

37:27.250 --> 37:28.330
This is good stuff.

37:29.583 --> 37:31.083
You have many titles, uh...

37:31.167 --> 37:32.417
musician, actor,

37:32.625 --> 37:34.205
producer, philanthropist.

37:34.833 --> 37:35.753
But at the end of the day,

37:35.833 --> 37:38.193
aren't you just a millionaire
who's married to a supermodel?

37:42.417 --> 37:45.377
I, uh, am married to a supermodel, yes.

37:46.042 --> 37:47.042
[Zach] I'll look her up.

37:47.333 --> 37:48.333
He met her.

37:48.417 --> 37:49.327
- You met her?
- I did?

37:49.417 --> 37:50.417
[Carol] Yeah.

37:50.708 --> 37:51.958
- When?
- Yes, of course.

37:52.542 --> 37:53.542
In the bar.

37:53.583 --> 37:55.293
[John] <i>You met my wife in a bar?</i>

37:55.792 --> 37:57.434
I meet a lot of people.
I meet a lot of people.

37:57.458 --> 37:58.828
[Carol] It was last night.

37:59.167 --> 38:00.827
You met my wife last night?

38:01.083 --> 38:03.018
- What does she look like?
- [Carol] <i>She's gorgeous.</i>

38:03.042 --> 38:05.672
I told you, "Go over and talk to her,
we can get an interview."

38:07.292 --> 38:08.132
I don't remember her.

38:08.208 --> 38:09.928
[Carol] Why are you
staring at me like this?

38:10.083 --> 38:10.923
What?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.143
I feel you're trying to communicate
something that I don't get.

38:13.167 --> 38:14.377
[whispering] Shut the fuck up.

38:18.458 --> 38:19.458
[whispering] Carol.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Zach!

38:21.917 --> 38:22.997
That was fun, man.

38:23.417 --> 38:24.417
Yeah.

38:24.625 --> 38:25.625
Don't leave yet.

38:26.458 --> 38:27.538
Give me a hug, brother.

38:27.917 --> 38:28.917
Okay.

38:31.458 --> 38:33.168
[whispering] I know what you did.

38:35.958 --> 38:37.328
- [spraying]
- Ah!

38:38.583 --> 38:41.673
[Zach screaming]

38:41.750 --> 38:44.000
- God! God!
- [phone buzzing]

38:45.375 --> 38:46.875
Yeah. I'll be out in a second.

38:47.042 --> 38:48.268
Just meet me at the back entrance.

38:48.292 --> 38:49.712
[moaning]

38:49.792 --> 38:50.792
[Carol] Zach?

38:51.083 --> 38:51.923
What just happened?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.750
He sprayed mace on my penis!

38:53.833 --> 38:54.673
What did you do?

38:54.750 --> 38:58.420
He's probably retaliating
'cause I had intercourse with his wife!

38:58.750 --> 38:59.750
What?

38:59.875 --> 39:03.745
[sobbing]
I had sex with Chrissy Teigen.

39:03.833 --> 39:04.963
No, you didn't.

39:05.250 --> 39:07.920
Why else would he come
and spray me where it happened?

39:08.250 --> 39:09.250
[Carol] Ew.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.960
It'll go away in, like, a half-hour.

39:11.042 --> 39:13.252
I've been sprayed before. It's not bad.

39:13.333 --> 39:15.923
[Zach whimpering]

39:16.083 --> 39:17.293
Oh, God!

39:24.083 --> 39:25.793
Excuse me, Mr. Hamm?

39:25.875 --> 39:27.375
- Hi!
<i>- Hi, my name is Zach,</i>

39:27.458 --> 39:28.788
I have a public access talk show,

39:28.875 --> 39:31.156
and I was wondering
if you would like to be a guest on it?

39:33.583 --> 39:34.633
Absolutely.

39:34.708 --> 39:36.498
Guys, we're gonna need
to take a quick break.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.083
My friend Jack just asked me
to be on his TV show,

39:39.167 --> 39:40.827
and I don't say no to anything, so...

39:40.917 --> 39:43.827
- Thank you so much. Yeah.
- [applauding]

39:44.208 --> 39:47.328
The Me Too movement has been
an important learning process for men.

39:47.667 --> 39:49.307
Do you feel like
you've missed out on that

39:49.375 --> 39:52.175
because every woman you've ever met
just wants to fuck your brains out?

39:53.292 --> 39:56.882
Bradley Cooper co-wrote, produced,
directed, and starred in <i>A Star is Born.</i>

39:56.958 --> 39:57.878
I hear it's great.

39:57.958 --> 40:00.788
Are you hoping that will open doors
for other hot idiots?

40:01.917 --> 40:03.457
Uh, you know...

40:03.542 --> 40:06.212
At what point during the making of <i>Tag</i>
did you guys realize

40:06.292 --> 40:10.212
that you were making one of the most
iconic pieces of mediocrity ever produced?

40:10.292 --> 40:13.252
[Jon laughing]

40:14.333 --> 40:15.543
I get it!

40:17.167 --> 40:19.707
My guest today is Hailee Steinfeld.

40:19.792 --> 40:20.792
All right.

40:20.958 --> 40:23.128
- Nice to have you here, Sta... Stailee...
- Thank...

40:23.208 --> 40:25.128
To have... Nice to hear... Have...

40:25.458 --> 40:26.958
Nice to have you here, Stailee.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.210
You were in <i>Pitch Perfect 2</i> and <i>3.</i>

40:29.333 --> 40:31.133
Do you ever wish
you had been in the good one?

40:32.958 --> 40:34.958
You have 12 million Instagram followers.

40:35.542 --> 40:38.502
How long did it take you to apologize
to each one of them for <i>Bumblebee?</i>

40:39.542 --> 40:40.922
<i>I walked out of that movie.</i>

40:41.500 --> 40:43.420
I'm just kidding,
I didn't walk out of the movie.

40:43.958 --> 40:46.498
<i>I skipped out
'cause I was so happy to be leaving.</i>

40:46.583 --> 40:47.583
Wow.

40:48.375 --> 40:49.995
You dated a guy from One Direction.

40:50.250 --> 40:53.080
Which one direction
was his penis pointing, north or south?

40:55.583 --> 40:56.583
Are we done?

40:58.792 --> 41:00.212
Hey, Zach, could I get this?

41:00.292 --> 41:02.772
Absolutely. Matter of fact,
if you guys want some trinkets too,

41:02.833 --> 41:04.133
it's on me. My treat.

41:11.750 --> 41:13.290
My guest today is...

41:13.375 --> 41:14.375
Aquafina.

41:14.583 --> 41:15.583
Awkwafina.

41:15.667 --> 41:16.747
Like the water?

41:16.833 --> 41:18.883
Well, it's spelled differently, so...

41:18.958 --> 41:21.078
You've been raping since the age of 13...

41:21.167 --> 41:22.167
Rapping.

41:22.458 --> 41:24.038
- Rapping.
- That makes more sense.

41:25.083 --> 41:27.333
You starred in, um, <i>Ocean's 8.</i>

41:27.417 --> 41:28.327
It's a great movie.

41:28.417 --> 41:31.077
I'd love to see an all-male
reboot of <i>Ocean's 8.</i>

41:31.750 --> 41:32.880
- That would be nice.
- Yeah.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.708
There... It exists already.

41:34.875 --> 41:35.875
Couple of them.

41:35.917 --> 41:38.667
Couple of what?
Male versions of the female <i>Ocean's 8?</i>

41:38.750 --> 41:40.210
<i>Ocean's 8 </i> was a reboot of a male...

41:40.292 --> 41:42.059
Next thing you're gonna tell me
there's a male <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

41:42.083 --> 41:43.083
There is.

41:44.250 --> 41:45.960
- It's with, um...
- Leslie Jones.

41:46.042 --> 41:47.042
No.

41:50.917 --> 41:53.247
You got famous for peeing from a zip line.

41:53.333 --> 41:54.463
What's your next project?

41:54.542 --> 41:55.922
Queefing on a ski lift?

41:56.333 --> 41:58.133
No, I already queefed on a podcast.

41:58.208 --> 42:00.168
Is that how you got your nickname,
Queef Latifah?

42:00.583 --> 42:01.463
Possibly.

42:01.542 --> 42:04.172
Do you ever wish people would stop
calling you a female comedian?

42:04.625 --> 42:05.625
Yeah.

42:05.667 --> 42:07.987
Don't you think they should
just call you a black comedian?

42:08.583 --> 42:10.833
It's better than them
calling me a male comedian.

42:11.292 --> 42:13.002
You were raised in the foster care system,

42:13.083 --> 42:15.543
which brings us to our sponsor,
Foster's beer.

42:15.875 --> 42:17.495
Can you look at this camera right here

42:17.583 --> 42:19.003
and say,

42:19.125 --> 42:20.393
[with Australian accent]
"Foster beer,

42:20.417 --> 42:22.287
the best beer for foster kids."

42:22.375 --> 42:23.375
I'm not doing that.

42:23.583 --> 42:24.583
No.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.207
[giggling]

42:28.208 --> 42:32.128
[band playing melancholy country-folk]

42:35.250 --> 42:41.580
<i>âª The things you said are
Hanging in the middle of my mind âª</i>

42:44.458 --> 42:47.328
Hey, can I just take a second?
I wanted to, um...

42:49.250 --> 42:50.580
I just want to thank you guys

42:51.333 --> 42:53.333
for going on this venture with me,
and, uh...

42:53.833 --> 42:55.293
this has been a dream of mine.

42:55.750 --> 42:57.290
As a kid, I realized that people

42:57.375 --> 42:59.625
love to point and laugh
and look at me.

43:01.042 --> 43:02.132
And I knew then...

43:03.167 --> 43:04.457
I have the It Factor.

43:05.875 --> 43:09.325
So, I just wanted to thank you guys
for helping me capitalize on that.

43:09.958 --> 43:10.958
[Cam] <i>Hey, I want to say,</i>

43:11.333 --> 43:13.133
when we first started
on this whole trip,

43:13.208 --> 43:15.668
I found you to be annoying
and hard to be around,

43:16.500 --> 43:17.750
and that hasn't changed.

43:18.958 --> 43:20.328
I'm kidding! [laughs]

43:20.417 --> 43:21.247
Ha!

43:21.333 --> 43:22.684
- Yeah, I know! Yeah.
- That's why it's funny,

43:22.708 --> 43:24.458
'cause it has changed.
I actually,

43:24.917 --> 43:26.077
you know, I think...

43:26.667 --> 43:28.207
I don't know, I kinda...

43:28.292 --> 43:29.172
I like you.

43:29.250 --> 43:30.790
- Wow.
- Well...

43:31.458 --> 43:32.498
thank you, Cam.

43:32.583 --> 43:33.583
You're welcome.

43:33.625 --> 43:36.165
[Carol] Well, I'd like to say
a little something, too.

43:36.250 --> 43:38.710
Ever since my dad shot my mom
and then killed himself,

43:38.792 --> 43:40.292
I felt kind of...

43:40.583 --> 43:41.423
unmoored,

43:41.500 --> 43:43.790
but you've made me really
feel stable and needed.

43:43.875 --> 43:45.325
- So, thank you so much.
- What?

43:45.750 --> 43:49.290
Oh, yeah, my dad killed my mom
then killed himself, 'cause...

43:49.375 --> 43:51.455
- When... when did that happen?
- A while ago.

43:51.625 --> 43:52.625
Like, a month.

43:53.375 --> 43:56.035
You didn't take any time off of work,
you didn't say anything?

43:56.125 --> 43:57.125
I'm fine.

43:58.625 --> 43:59.535
I'd like to do a toast,

43:59.625 --> 44:00.726
- if that's possible?
- [Cam] Yeah.

44:00.750 --> 44:01.830
- Yeah.
- Let's do a toast.

44:01.917 --> 44:02.917
Okay.

44:03.583 --> 44:05.253
Here's to the crazy ones,

44:06.167 --> 44:07.167
the misfits,

44:07.667 --> 44:08.667
maniacs,

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
to the loonies,

44:10.542 --> 44:11.542
and ding-dongs.

44:12.375 --> 44:14.415
And some people would say
that we're the crazy ones,

44:14.958 --> 44:15.958
but I think...

44:16.500 --> 44:17.580
we're geniuses,

44:18.208 --> 44:19.328
because we're...

44:19.875 --> 44:20.915
crazy enough

44:23.125 --> 44:25.495
to try to change
this ding-dong crazy world.

44:26.792 --> 44:27.632
Cheers.

44:27.708 --> 44:29.498
That was a great speech.

44:30.333 --> 44:32.253
Would you like to, uh, dance?

44:32.333 --> 44:33.173
[titters]

44:33.250 --> 44:34.250
With me, though.

44:34.583 --> 44:35.583
- Yes. Okay.
- Okay.

44:37.208 --> 44:42.288
<i>âª I think about you
Walking on a street âª</i>

44:42.375 --> 44:43.495
You wanna dance?

44:43.583 --> 44:44.633
I wanna dance alone.

44:44.708 --> 44:49.498

<i>Come on.</i>

45:12.583 --> 45:13.583
[clerk] Hello.

45:14.125 --> 45:14.955
Hi.

45:15.042 --> 45:16.082
Room 203.

45:16.167 --> 45:18.497
There should be some...
several rooms under that.

45:18.583 --> 45:20.333
Yes, here's your receipt.

45:21.458 --> 45:23.038
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

45:23.500 --> 45:24.500
Very much.

45:25.542 --> 45:26.832
What are all these charges?

45:26.917 --> 45:27.997
It's itemized, sir.

45:28.542 --> 45:31.172
I just, I didn't realize
when you take out the, um,

45:32.000 --> 45:35.750
the crackers in the snack drawer
that they charge you for it or the drinks.

45:35.833 --> 45:36.883
You didn't realize that?

45:36.958 --> 45:39.726
Well, I didn't know, like, even if you
put it back, you're still charged.

45:39.750 --> 45:42.880
If you eat it or drink it, yes.

45:42.958 --> 45:44.288
Did you eat the stuff, too?

45:44.375 --> 45:45.875
I moved it and then I ate it, yeah.

45:46.042 --> 45:49.002
But, just 'cause I move it
I shouldn't be charged.

45:49.083 --> 45:50.793
What are these? Those look like...

45:51.292 --> 45:52.462
I rented one movie.

45:53.125 --> 45:54.125
Big deal.

45:55.333 --> 45:56.333
Is that porn?

45:57.083 --> 45:59.503
I thought it was <i>Analyze This,</i>
but it was <i>Anal-yze This.</i>

46:00.125 --> 46:02.018
They didn't even have to change
the spelling of it.

46:02.042 --> 46:04.672
You rented <i>Anal-yze This</i>
several times in a row.

46:04.750 --> 46:07.710
I kept hitting it 'cause I was,
"Well, maybe <i>Analyze This </i> will come..."

46:07.833 --> 46:09.503
The point being is...

46:09.625 --> 46:12.225
You should see the guy they had
playing Billy Crystal, by the way.

46:13.542 --> 46:15.726
- I'm not paying for this.
- You've already paid for it.

46:15.750 --> 46:16.960
This is just your receipt.

46:17.833 --> 46:20.213
But, I'm saying
I'm not paying for it... again.

46:25.708 --> 46:27.538
- [Boom Boom] I'm hungry.
- I'm starving.

46:27.625 --> 46:28.535
I'm so hungry.

46:28.625 --> 46:30.705
You guys wanna do
a family-style type thing?

46:31.792 --> 46:34.042
No, I think we each
wanted to get our own thing.

46:34.125 --> 46:35.035
- I was...
- [waiter] Hey, gang.

46:35.125 --> 46:37.125
Did you get a chance
to look at the menus here?

46:37.208 --> 46:38.248
I'll take a grape juice...

46:38.333 --> 46:41.003
Uh, no, we'll have, uh,
four waters for the table.

46:41.083 --> 46:41.923
No grape juice.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.380
Can I get an orange soda?

46:43.458 --> 46:44.643
- Okay, orange...
- We'll split.

46:44.667 --> 46:46.147
Maybe we can split a soda three ways.

46:46.208 --> 46:48.038
Can you do one soda with two extra cups,

46:48.125 --> 46:51.285
but just charge us once, and then
put the other two, just put refills in it?

46:51.375 --> 46:52.495
It just has to be...

46:52.708 --> 46:54.748
one cup you all share.

46:55.042 --> 46:57.042
I can bring four straws?

46:57.167 --> 46:58.377
[Chloe] Sweet. Cool.

46:58.458 --> 47:00.378
How many clam strips come in an order?

47:00.458 --> 47:01.498
Six.

47:01.583 --> 47:04.333
- How big are they?
- Well, have you ever seen a chicken strip?

47:05.042 --> 47:06.922
I've never seen a chicken wear clothes.

47:08.375 --> 47:10.875
No, I mean like baked into a strip, not...

47:12.542 --> 47:13.792
- You bake them?
- That's fine.

47:13.875 --> 47:17.285
One is good. Look, we'll get an order
of the clam strips and a scoop of tuna.

47:17.542 --> 47:19.172
And can I get a, uh...

47:19.250 --> 47:20.580
mug of hot water, please?

47:24.125 --> 47:25.575
[Zach] <i>What were you saying earlier</i>

47:25.667 --> 47:28.627
about your buddy Martin Freeman
being the only good part of <i>Black Panther?</i>

47:28.708 --> 47:29.538
What?

47:29.625 --> 47:31.825
It's just a weird thing to say
to someone you just met.

47:32.250 --> 47:33.670
- But I didn't say that.
- Ready?

47:34.042 --> 47:36.962
Hi, welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

47:37.042 --> 47:39.252
I'm your host,
Zach Galifianakis, and...

47:39.708 --> 47:41.418
my guest today is

47:41.500 --> 47:43.750
Benedick Cumberbut... Batch.

47:44.417 --> 47:46.627
Benedick, Benedick Cumberbat... Bun.

47:47.083 --> 47:48.083
Cam...

47:48.667 --> 47:49.707
Benedick Cam...

47:50.458 --> 47:51.458
Benefit Lumberjacks.

47:51.542 --> 47:52.672
Ju... Uh, Bit...

47:52.833 --> 47:53.934
- Uh, Benedict...
- Cumberdit...

47:53.958 --> 47:55.128
Cumberba... Uh...

47:55.750 --> 47:57.170
Benedict Cumberbatch.

47:57.375 --> 47:58.705
- That's what it is.
- Yeah.

47:59.042 --> 48:01.422
You once said
you're your own worst critic.

48:02.333 --> 48:04.173
So, you haven't read any of your reviews?

48:04.250 --> 48:05.250
No, no, I try not to.

48:05.333 --> 48:06.976
Has there ever been
anything negative written about...

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

48:08.583 --> 48:10.253
A horse-faced, wooden...

48:10.667 --> 48:12.518
- I see that, now you say that.
- ...oddly-named.

48:12.542 --> 48:14.172
- That I do see.
- Yeah.

48:14.583 --> 48:17.213
You got your start doing theater
and independent films.

48:17.292 --> 48:18.292
I did.

48:18.333 --> 48:20.213
And now you're acting
in Marvel movies.

48:20.292 --> 48:22.042
How good does it feel to sell-out?

48:24.042 --> 48:25.502
Uh, I don't think it's a sell-out.

48:25.583 --> 48:27.293
I think they're pretty cool films.

48:27.375 --> 48:29.625
There's a lot for an actor to do in them.
So...

48:29.708 --> 48:30.708
You wear a cape?

48:30.917 --> 48:31.997
No, I wear a cloak.

48:35.292 --> 48:38.962
Do you think you play smart characters
like Sherlock Holmes because you have...

48:39.250 --> 48:41.630
you have one of these,
you know, these faces...

48:41.708 --> 48:44.628
Can we... Is there a...
Let's just get a close-up here.

48:44.708 --> 48:46.378
It's a face that could go either way.

48:46.625 --> 48:48.995
It can use inductive reasoning
to solve mysteries,

48:49.083 --> 48:50.713
or it's the type of face that...

48:51.083 --> 48:53.043
masturbates all day wearing a helmet.

48:53.875 --> 48:55.035
See, it's a fine line.

48:57.042 --> 48:59.252
You played Vincent van Gogh in a movie.

48:59.333 --> 49:00.633
I did, yes.

49:01.125 --> 49:03.325
This is Vincent van Gogh
answering his cell phone.

49:04.292 --> 49:05.292
Hello... [sighs]

49:05.625 --> 49:06.625
Hello?

49:07.750 --> 49:08.750
It's hilarious.

49:09.292 --> 49:10.712
If you didn't have an accent,

49:10.792 --> 49:13.792
do you think people would be able
to tell that you're not a very good actor?

49:14.083 --> 49:16.583
Yeah, no, I think my accent
probably does help, that's true.

49:16.667 --> 49:17.957
Can you do an American accent?

49:18.792 --> 49:19.632
Yes, I can.

49:19.750 --> 49:20.830
Um...

49:21.125 --> 49:22.665
okay, maybe I'll give you a few words?

49:22.750 --> 49:23.580
Sure.

49:23.667 --> 49:26.417
That's a nice bicycle you have there,
my young son.

49:29.125 --> 49:32.285
[with American accent] Well, that's a nice
bicycle you have there, my young son.

49:33.208 --> 49:35.958
- Pervert. Get away from me.
- Pervert. Get away from me.

49:36.042 --> 49:38.202
- No, that's me responding.
- No, that's me responding.

49:40.458 --> 49:42.458
- You have a rabid fan base, and it's...
- A what?

49:42.542 --> 49:44.862
- You have a rabid...
- I thought you said "rabbit." Sorry.

49:46.250 --> 49:47.290
Why... I said rabid.

49:47.375 --> 49:48.495
It's vowels with you,

49:48.583 --> 49:50.673
so I can't sometimes
understand what you're saying.

49:50.750 --> 49:53.170
All right, I'll say "rabbit."
You have a "rabbit" fan base.

49:53.250 --> 49:54.559
- That what you want?
- No, just "d", "d".

49:54.583 --> 49:56.883
You have a fan base full of rabbits.

49:56.958 --> 49:57.958
[annunciating] Rabid.

49:58.667 --> 50:00.827
Do they fuck a lot
while they come see your plays?

50:00.917 --> 50:03.417
Are the rabbits always
having sex in the audience,

50:03.500 --> 50:04.500
- while...
- Unbelievable.

50:04.583 --> 50:06.793
Are you good friends
with the Easter Bunny?

50:07.125 --> 50:08.575
Do you know Bugs?

50:11.208 --> 50:12.208
[sighs]

50:17.417 --> 50:19.127
Everything, uh, everything good?

50:19.208 --> 50:21.458
You got kinda heated in there with...

50:21.542 --> 50:24.132
with Cumber... Cumercleat...
Cumbercleatch.

50:24.208 --> 50:26.078
It's Dickerflick Cabbagepatch.

50:26.167 --> 50:28.287
<i>I just... Look, I...</i> [exhales deeply]

50:29.042 --> 50:31.962
I don't wanna put this on you guys,
but, uh...

50:32.417 --> 50:33.707
we're in a little bit of a...

50:34.333 --> 50:37.253
budget situation,
we're strapped for cash right now.

50:37.333 --> 50:39.753
That's okay, you can just
call Will Ferrell.

50:39.833 --> 50:41.143
- Oh, yeah.
- He can send more money.

50:41.167 --> 50:42.167
I'll call him right now.

50:42.458 --> 50:43.893
- Don't do...
- How do you spell Ferrell?

50:43.917 --> 50:44.917
Don't do that.

50:45.875 --> 50:49.075
When I said that he was
bankrolling this project,

50:49.167 --> 50:50.167
I meant...

50:50.333 --> 50:53.133
I meant he was bankrolling it
in the future tense.

50:53.708 --> 50:54.708
What?

50:54.792 --> 50:56.632
He didn't give us any money upfront,

50:56.708 --> 50:58.168
and we're running low.

50:58.750 --> 51:00.040
So, you lied about Will Ferrell?

51:00.125 --> 51:01.125
Oh, that's great.

51:01.167 --> 51:04.287
Let me guess, he never actually said
that we could be a part of the show?

51:04.375 --> 51:05.825
Did you lie about that, too?

51:05.917 --> 51:08.377
As soon as we get to Los Angeles,
everything will be fine.

51:08.458 --> 51:09.918
I'm not gonna leave you guys behind.

51:10.958 --> 51:11.958
We're friends.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
Oh, are we?

51:13.417 --> 51:15.667
Are we? Or are we just
a bunch of dumb shits

51:16.125 --> 51:18.625
<i>that you tricked
into doing unpaid labor for you?</i>

51:18.708 --> 51:19.708
Come on. Come on.

51:24.583 --> 51:25.583
[Zach] Carol...

51:40.375 --> 51:42.035
- Hi, Norma!
- [woman] Hi, Tessa!

51:42.125 --> 51:44.268
What are you doing out here
in the middle of nowhere anyway?

51:44.292 --> 51:46.582
I'm researching for a film
that I'm doing next.

51:46.667 --> 51:47.667
What kind of research?

51:47.750 --> 51:50.380
I'm just learning
how to be a boring person.

51:50.458 --> 51:51.498
Oh, really?

51:51.625 --> 51:53.455
My guest today is...

51:54.042 --> 51:55.332
Tesla Thompson.

51:55.458 --> 51:56.768
- Tesla? Tesla Thompson?
- [Carol] Tessa.

51:56.792 --> 51:58.792
No, Tes... Yeah, just Tessa.

51:58.875 --> 51:59.875
Like the car.

51:59.917 --> 52:01.476
- [Tessa] No, no, unlike the car.
- Tesla, like the car?

52:01.500 --> 52:03.393
- Like, if you take the "L" out of it.
- But, it says,

52:03.417 --> 52:04.417
"Tessa...

52:04.542 --> 52:06.502
parenthetically, like the car."

52:06.583 --> 52:08.434
[Tessa] But, you don't say it
like you say the car.

52:08.458 --> 52:09.828
'Cause then that's not my name.

52:09.917 --> 52:11.127
I drive a Tessa.

52:11.625 --> 52:12.625
You were in Creed.

52:12.667 --> 52:13.667
Mm-hmm.

52:13.708 --> 52:15.128
What's Scott Stapp like?

52:15.208 --> 52:17.128
- Who?
- The singer in your band.

52:17.958 --> 52:19.708
Were you in Cr...
It says you were in Creed.

52:19.792 --> 52:21.252
No, the movie, not the band.

52:21.958 --> 52:23.578
Oh. Well, what's Scott Stapp like?

52:24.542 --> 52:27.582
I never... I didn't...
We didn't meet 'cause I'm...

52:27.958 --> 52:29.418
They weren't involved in the movie.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.330
But, would you like to meet him one day?

52:32.958 --> 52:34.078
I mean, yeah, sure,

52:34.167 --> 52:37.707
if the opportunity presented itself
and I didn't have to drive anywhere, yeah.

52:38.292 --> 52:41.082
Women are always being told
to watch their weight in Hollywood.

52:41.167 --> 52:44.827
So, why do you think so many actresses
could still stand to lose a few pounds?

52:45.250 --> 52:46.710
I mean, you look at Hollywood

52:46.792 --> 52:48.792
and all the men
that get to age gracefully.

52:48.875 --> 52:52.075
It looks like they haven't been to a gym,

52:52.167 --> 52:54.037
they get to come in disheveled,

52:54.125 --> 52:55.955
and they look like they need to shower,

52:56.042 --> 52:58.332
and they're wearing
just, like, some blazer,

52:58.417 --> 53:00.627
and be told
that they just look distinguished,

53:00.708 --> 53:01.918
but really they just look...

53:02.667 --> 53:04.077
pretty disgusting, so...

53:04.458 --> 53:05.708
Yeah, I hear you.

53:05.917 --> 53:07.268
That's... that's gotta be frustrating.

53:07.292 --> 53:08.292
Yeah.

53:11.458 --> 53:14.788
- [Carol] So this like a shortcut?
- [Boom Boom] Where are we going?

53:14.875 --> 53:16.893
[Zach] I don't know if this
is where you check in, or...

53:16.917 --> 53:17.747
[Cam] Now what?

53:17.875 --> 53:20.355
- [Carol] What do you mean?
- [Zach] We'll see what's going on.

53:26.542 --> 53:28.184
- [Carol] This looks weird.
- [Cam] Where are we?

53:28.208 --> 53:29.578
This where we're staying tonight.

53:30.125 --> 53:32.375
You said we were staying
at the Four Seasons.

53:33.125 --> 53:37.495
I said that we were staying at a place
that was closed for three of the seasons.

53:37.583 --> 53:38.893
Oh, Jesus Christ.
We're supposed to believe that?

53:38.917 --> 53:40.393
That's exactly what I said
and for you guys

53:40.417 --> 53:42.097
to run your mouths
like it was something...

53:42.125 --> 53:44.625
You are a liar and you have deceived us.

53:44.708 --> 53:46.708
Yes, it's an abandoned campground,

53:46.792 --> 53:49.332
but let's just stay here for the night
and have some fun.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.250
He's crazy. He's literally losing it.

53:53.333 --> 53:54.809
[Boom Boom] He's under a lot of stress.

53:54.833 --> 53:57.083
But, we only have one more episode to go.

53:57.167 --> 53:58.407
Hey, Zach found a fishing pole,

53:58.458 --> 54:00.698
so we're gonna go on the lake
and try to catch something.

54:05.625 --> 54:07.325
[Zach] Let me put the hot dog on it.

54:07.875 --> 54:09.165
- You have a hot dog?
- Yeah.

54:09.792 --> 54:10.792
We could've eaten that.

54:10.833 --> 54:11.833
You want a piece?

54:11.875 --> 54:13.893
- No, I don't wanna a piece.
- I can give you that one.

54:13.917 --> 54:15.327
It's been in your pocket all day.

54:15.417 --> 54:17.417
It's only two days old, it's fine.
Hot dogs keep.

54:17.500 --> 54:19.250
- Use it.
- Fine.

54:19.750 --> 54:20.750
[reel clicks]

54:22.500 --> 54:23.580
Just give me a second.

54:26.125 --> 54:27.915
[reel clicks, hook splashes]

54:28.833 --> 54:29.833
You get caught?

54:30.458 --> 54:31.998
- You gotta get it...
- God Almighty!

54:32.083 --> 54:33.083
[thumping]

54:33.375 --> 54:34.825
- Hey.
- [Zach sighing heavily]

54:37.208 --> 54:38.208
What's going on?

54:38.708 --> 54:39.578
I just feel like...

54:39.667 --> 54:40.667
[stammering]

54:40.750 --> 54:41.790
What are we doing?

54:42.542 --> 54:46.252
I... I'm fishing on a giant goose
looking for food.

54:46.875 --> 54:47.995
You got this.

54:48.500 --> 54:50.500
You're gonna catch us fish for dinner,

54:50.583 --> 54:52.583
we're all going to eat like kings tonight.

54:53.292 --> 54:56.212
And you're gonna make a TV show
that's going to change the entire world.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Okay?

54:58.583 --> 54:59.583
I believe in you.

55:00.250 --> 55:02.420
You can't just give up
when someone believes in you.

55:06.042 --> 55:07.042
[exhales]

55:07.333 --> 55:09.693
I don't know what I'd do without you,
Carol, I really don't.

55:14.208 --> 55:16.498
If you could do anything with your life,
what would it be?

55:17.458 --> 55:18.458
Forget me,

55:18.833 --> 55:20.003
forget the cable access.

55:20.083 --> 55:21.083
What would you do?

55:21.458 --> 55:23.828
Once upon a time,
I thought about being a trumpet player.

55:25.833 --> 55:28.383
That was right before we left
on this trip. I bought a trumpet.

55:32.292 --> 55:33.792
- That was in your purse?
- Yeah.

55:34.208 --> 55:36.288
Just in case I ever get the guts
to give it a toot.

55:37.333 --> 55:38.673
Well, what are you afraid of?

55:40.125 --> 55:41.705
I'm scared I might be too good at it,

55:42.292 --> 55:43.372
and I'll have to leave you.

55:44.042 --> 55:45.212
Well, then you become...

55:46.042 --> 55:48.752
a famous trumpeter
and you leave me behind. It's okay.

55:49.167 --> 55:50.917
If you wanna play the trumpet, go ahead.

55:51.542 --> 55:53.462
Lip up. Give that thing a toot.

55:54.333 --> 55:55.333
Okay.

55:55.875 --> 55:56.875
[laughing] Okay!

55:58.833 --> 56:00.713
I watched a ton of videos
on how to do it.

56:03.042 --> 56:07.082
[playing trumpet off-key]

56:14.583 --> 56:16.633
[trumpet sputtering]

56:19.917 --> 56:20.747
It's a good start.

56:20.833 --> 56:22.043
You play that trumpet.

56:22.667 --> 56:24.037
I'm gonna catch us some fish.

56:26.958 --> 56:29.748
[trumpet continues off-key]

56:36.708 --> 56:39.248
Okay, everybody.
Can everybody gather round, please?

56:39.625 --> 56:40.625
Gather round.

56:40.958 --> 56:41.958
All right.

56:42.042 --> 56:43.832
So, we're at Peter Dinklage's house.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.790
This is our last interview.
Obviously, he's as rich as Croesus.

56:47.458 --> 56:48.458
I have a plan.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.290
Carol, he's going to be distracted
during the interview.

56:51.833 --> 56:54.003
I need you to steal some of his stuff.

56:54.583 --> 56:55.923
- What?
- What? No!

56:56.000 --> 56:57.601
- We're not stealing!
- You can't do that. No.

56:57.625 --> 57:00.455
I know... Not a lot of stuff,
just enough stuff so I can sell it later,

57:00.542 --> 57:01.422
so we have some dough.

57:01.500 --> 57:04.018
- I don't feel comfortable with that.
- [Boom Boom] <i>You don't have to do that.</i>

57:04.042 --> 57:05.132
Okay, I'll do it.

57:05.792 --> 57:07.872
You have to work the camera.
Plus, you're too stupid.

57:08.833 --> 57:09.833
Carol,

57:09.958 --> 57:11.328
if we don't get to Los Angeles...

57:12.833 --> 57:14.253
our talk show dreams are over.

57:16.708 --> 57:17.708
Please?

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
[sighing]

57:20.333 --> 57:21.333
Okay.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.920
Let's steal Peter Dinklage's stuff.

57:24.583 --> 57:25.713
- [Zach] Okay.
- Yeah.

57:25.792 --> 57:26.792
Okay!

57:27.208 --> 57:28.628
Game faces! Let's go.

57:29.125 --> 57:30.995
All right. I'll get the ferns.

57:37.750 --> 57:39.000
Hey, yeah,

57:39.292 --> 57:41.172
the <i>Ferns </i> peoples.

57:41.542 --> 57:42.542
Come on.

57:45.167 --> 57:46.377
<i>Come on, don't be shy.</i>

57:47.792 --> 57:49.212
Late one last night.

57:49.750 --> 57:50.750
[Carol] Oh, wow.

57:51.333 --> 57:52.503
What a fancy house.

57:52.833 --> 57:54.963
Tell us about
all of your expensive things.

57:55.375 --> 57:56.875
[chuckles] All right.

57:57.667 --> 57:59.377
I was just about to anyway.

57:59.458 --> 58:01.578
You're noticing my Warhol, I see.

58:02.250 --> 58:03.250
[Zach] Wow.

58:03.292 --> 58:04.462
Must be really expensive.

58:04.542 --> 58:07.962
Oh, about 250K. Got that for a steal.

58:08.042 --> 58:09.632
Was LaCroix around back then?

58:09.708 --> 58:10.708
[Peter] <i> Yeah.</i>

58:10.917 --> 58:11.827
[with French accent] <i>LaCroix!</i>

58:11.917 --> 58:14.377
Seems like it must be
hard to get that off the wall.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
Over here...

58:19.000 --> 58:21.130
[Carol]
<i>Winds Of Winter</i> by George R.R. Martin?

58:21.583 --> 58:22.713
It's not even out yet!

58:23.042 --> 58:25.282
I bet that would fetch a pretty penny
on the open market.

58:26.208 --> 58:27.208
Check this out.

58:27.292 --> 58:28.292
[grunts]

58:30.250 --> 58:31.880
<i>Et voilÃ .</i> [chuckles]

58:32.917 --> 58:34.417
Are those FabergÃ© eggs?

58:34.500 --> 58:35.830
Yes, they are indeed.

58:35.917 --> 58:36.747
Wow.

58:36.917 --> 58:39.207
You know what's the most amazing thing
about this, though?

58:39.583 --> 58:40.583
Uh...

58:41.417 --> 58:42.627
FabergÃ© egg carton.

58:43.083 --> 58:44.083
[Zach] Wow.

58:44.375 --> 58:46.018
- Is that worth a lot of money?
- [Peter] Oh...

58:46.042 --> 58:47.462
- [Carol] Like, how much?
- Oh...

58:47.750 --> 58:49.540
You can't even
think of a number that high.

58:49.625 --> 58:50.665
Okay, great.

58:51.167 --> 58:52.917
Thank you.
We'll set up for the interview.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.101
So, we're gonna do the interview?

58:54.125 --> 58:55.125
Let's do it.

59:00.167 --> 59:02.457
Hi, welcome to another edition
of <i>Between Two Ferns.</i>

59:02.542 --> 59:04.632
I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis,

59:04.708 --> 59:06.208
and my guest today...

59:06.667 --> 59:08.167
is Peter Dinklage.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.290
Thank you for joining me, Mr. Dinklage.

59:11.583 --> 59:12.463
Mm-hmm.

59:12.542 --> 59:13.542
Dinklage.

59:14.208 --> 59:15.498
Is that an STD?

59:16.500 --> 59:19.670
Uh, I think in German
it's von Dincklage, but...

59:20.000 --> 59:21.290
Why did you keep your real name?

59:22.167 --> 59:23.747
I mean, if someone said to me,

59:23.833 --> 59:28.213
"You have to start an acting career
with the name Peter Dinkylage..."

59:28.292 --> 59:30.672
I'm thinking of other choices
I could've made right now.

59:31.667 --> 59:33.497
Well, Galifianakis is a stage name.

59:33.917 --> 59:34.827
What's your real name?

59:34.917 --> 59:37.287
My real name is Chad Farthouse.

59:38.417 --> 59:39.667
That doesn't sound right.

59:39.750 --> 59:41.880
[Zach] There's a kid
on the Disney Channel.

59:42.208 --> 59:43.828
Uh, Chad...

59:44.250 --> 59:45.080
Farthouse.

59:45.167 --> 59:47.327
He's on one of...
<i>Wizards Of Waverly Place,</i>

59:47.792 --> 59:48.832
with that last name.

59:49.167 --> 59:50.417
So, I had to change my name.

59:52.500 --> 59:53.670
You're in <i>X-Men, </i> right?

59:55.417 --> 59:56.997
You know who my favorite X-Man is?

59:57.750 --> 59:58.750
Caitlyn Jenner.

59:59.542 --> 01:00:01.422
And, by the way,
that's not an offensive joke.

01:00:01.792 --> 01:00:05.172
I'm honestly under the impression
that she was in the <i>X-Men </i> movies.

01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:08.998
You were in <i>ALF, </i> right?

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:10.583
<i>Elf.</i>

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.710
No, I mean, you were in ALF,
the costume?

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.458
- Um, hey!
- [Zach] Can I just...

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:17.875
Real quick,

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:19.434
and it's important you look at my face

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:21.378
'cause I think
the sincerity in this question

01:00:21.458 --> 01:00:22.878
is reading in my face.

01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:26.003
Tell us about how fun it was
to be in <i>Pixels.</i>

01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:28.205
<i>- Pixels, </i> was that a fun challenge?
- [eggs clanking]

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:29.538
Hey...

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:30.745
she's taking my eggs!

01:00:30.833 --> 01:00:32.173
- Hey, wait!
- Okay. Let's go!

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.040
- Hey!
- [Zach] Let's go! Grab it! Go!

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:34.955
Grab what you can!

01:00:35.042 --> 01:00:36.712
- Go!
- What the heck are you doing?

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:39.032
- What are you doing? Those are my eggs!
- [Zach] Go! Go!

01:00:39.083 --> 01:00:40.601
- [all yelling]
- [Peter] <i>My precious eggs!</i>

01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:41.995
<i>- No!</i>
- [tires squealing]

01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:44.537
- [Zach] Loved you in <i>Three Billboards!</i>
- [Peter] Shit!

01:00:44.833 --> 01:00:47.003
Why didn't I get attack dogs?

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:48.750
Well, I...

01:00:49.292 --> 01:00:51.292
still have $102 million dollars

01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:54.035
in my savings account alone. Ah.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.130
You'll be fine, Peter.

01:00:56.333 --> 01:00:57.503
You're a survivor.

01:00:57.833 --> 01:00:59.003
You will survive.

01:01:00.042 --> 01:01:02.212
[chatting indistinctly]

01:01:03.167 --> 01:01:05.567
So, guys, got a little cash
from selling Mr. Dinklage's eggs.

01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:08.205
Now, all we have to do
is get to Los Angeles by 9:00 a.m.,

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:10.495
- and get this show to Mr. Will Ferrell.
- Yes!

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:12.173
- [Boom Boom giggling]
- [Carol] Get in!

01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:22.630

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:19.167
Oh, it's "Jesus."

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.130
I always do that.

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:31.542
Oh, my God.

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:34.078
What happened to all my music?

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.250
- [truck horn honking]

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:38.673

[hissing]

01:02:52.167 --> 01:02:53.167
What happened?

01:02:55.167 --> 01:02:56.037
Oh..

01:02:56.125 --> 01:02:57.125
God.

01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:00.173
[Cam] Are you ki...

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:01.830
- How did this happen?
- What the fuck?

01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:03.917
We're fucked.

01:03:04.708 --> 01:03:06.708
We're never gonna make it
to Los Angeles now.

01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:07.922
Where are my ferns?

01:03:10.167 --> 01:03:11.167
Where are the fer...

01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:13.292
Wait!

Hey!

[yelling] You animal!

My ferns!

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:23.665
They're ruined!

01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:27.285
My ferns are ruined!

01:03:27.458 --> 01:03:29.378
Zach, don't worry,
we can get you new ferns.

01:03:29.458 --> 01:03:32.038
What am I thinking?
This is no way to get a talk show.

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:33.962
Driving around the country.

01:03:34.042 --> 01:03:35.582
There's absolutely no way

01:03:35.917 --> 01:03:37.787
we can make it to Los Angeles in time.

01:03:37.875 --> 01:03:38.875
It's okay.

01:03:38.917 --> 01:03:41.287
All we have to do
is just walk the nearest town...

01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:42.535
I'm no good for you guys.

01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:46.417
So, get away from me.

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:48.708
<i>It's over. I'm going back home.</i>

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:50.082
Zach, you can't give up.

01:03:50.583 --> 01:03:51.463
I need you.

01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:53.672
Yeah? Well, I can't do it any more.

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:57.125
So, leave.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.500
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:04:02.542 --> 01:04:03.542
We're going?

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:09.375

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:38.753
<i>And I would love to show them
that I am not a failure,</i>

01:05:39.167 --> 01:05:41.207
<i>and that I just appreciate them.</i>

01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:42.833
<i>So you feel like a failure now?</i>

01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:44.383
<i>Currently, yeah.</i>

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:47.668
<i>- But you wanna prove that you are not one?
- And I think I can do it today.</i>

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.710
<i>Well, Tina, you are down by quite a bit,</i>

01:05:50.917 --> 01:05:53.417
<i>but you still have a chance
to catch up and win.</i>

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:55.125
<i>That's why we call this show...</i>

01:05:55.208 --> 01:05:58.418
<i>Don't Give Up!</i>
[applause]

01:05:58.500 --> 01:05:59.500
Don't give up.

01:05:59.625 --> 01:06:02.325

01:06:07.875 --> 01:06:08.875
[Zach yelling] Carol!

01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:13.208
Carol!

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:15.165
- Carol!
- [Carol] Zach!

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:17.130
- Oh, my God! Zach!
- There you are.

01:06:17.208 --> 01:06:19.038
[Carol exclaiming]

01:06:20.083 --> 01:06:21.083
You were right.

01:06:21.292 --> 01:06:22.462
I should never give up.

01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:24.184
I just want to thank you
for believing in me.

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:26.893
No! Everything's fine, we found a guy
who's gonna take us to Los Angeles.

01:06:26.917 --> 01:06:28.226
- He's gonna drive us.
- Get in the car!

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.850
- Yeah?
- [Cam] Let's go, get in the car!

01:06:29.875 --> 01:06:31.535
We're doing it! We're doing it!

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
[Zach] <i>Thanks, Chuck!</i>

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.920
[Boom Boom] Go, go, go.
Bye! Thank you!

01:06:50.042 --> 01:06:50.882
[Carol yelps]

01:06:50.958 --> 01:06:52.518
[Zach] Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:53.542
[Carol groaning]

01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:55.851
What time is it?
Anybody know what time it is?

01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:57.825
- No!
- [Cam] Nobody wears a watch anymore.

01:06:57.917 --> 01:06:58.827
- [Zach] Come on.
- [elevator dings]

01:06:58.917 --> 01:06:59.997
[Carol] Shit, go.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.726
- [woman] Hey! You can't go in there.
- [Zach] This way! This way!

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:04.790
Just burst in, just go, go, go!

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:09.960
[counter clicking]

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Mr. Ferrell?

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:18.790
Mr. Ferrell, it's Zach Galifianakis,

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:20.745
from the internet show.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:23.083
I've got those tapes that you wanted.

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:25.333
Hello?

01:07:26.458 --> 01:07:27.578
[buzzing]

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:28.497
[spits]

01:07:28.583 --> 01:07:30.213
- Jesus Christ!
- [Carol gasping]

01:07:30.542 --> 01:07:31.462
What is that?

01:07:31.542 --> 01:07:33.082
- It's a teeth whitener.
- [Zach] Oh.

01:07:36.875 --> 01:07:37.875
[Will] Ah-ah-ah!

01:07:38.792 --> 01:07:41.462
Gently place the bag on the floor
and kick it over to me.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.458
Slowly.

01:07:44.792 --> 01:07:45.792
Slowly.

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:48.750
Gently.

01:07:49.583 --> 01:07:50.583
Gently.

01:07:52.042 --> 01:07:54.212
Now, kick it as hard as you can
across the floor.

01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:57.250
Keep kicking them.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:02.250
That's as hard as you can kick?
[laughs]

01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:03.333
- Do it.
- You can...

01:08:03.417 --> 01:08:05.457
Ah! Fu...

01:08:05.542 --> 01:08:06.672
Push it, if you have to.

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:08.923
[grunts]

01:08:13.667 --> 01:08:16.997
[sniffing]

01:08:17.957 --> 01:08:18.957
They're all there.

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.250
[continues sniffing]

01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:28.375
Episode ten.

01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:30.165
[chuckling]

01:08:30.917 --> 01:08:32.077
Nice job, Zachy Baby.

01:08:32.457 --> 01:08:34.725
I knew you were gonna say
something like that. I told you right?

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:36.850
- Yeah, you did.
- I said "Zachy Baby," and he said it.

01:08:36.875 --> 01:08:38.575
You completed your task.

01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:41.125
And now...

01:08:42.625 --> 01:08:43.625
you may leave.

01:08:44.667 --> 01:08:45.497
[buzzing]

01:08:45.582 --> 01:08:47.923
You told me that
if I delivered those tapes,

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:50.768
you'd give me my own network talk show.

01:08:51.625 --> 01:08:53.165
<i>Our</i> own talk show.

01:08:53.542 --> 01:08:56.082
Are you forgetting the "pro"
of the quid pro quo?

01:08:56.167 --> 01:08:59.077
I asked you to deliver
ten episodes of your show...

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:00.707
- [Zach] Yeah.
- ...by 9:00 a.m.

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:02.883
Yeah, it's 9:00 a.m.
It's before 9:00 a.m.

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:04.250
9:00 a.m...

01:09:05.457 --> 01:09:06.667
Tokyo time!

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:09.210
Before the markets open!

01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:11.825
I can't do anything with these!

01:09:12.082 --> 01:09:13.832
They are worthless to me,

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:15.327
you fat idiot!

01:09:17.667 --> 01:09:19.268
- How could we have known?
- There's no way...

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:20.921
It makes sense, though. Let's just go.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.479
Let's just get out of here. I'm so...

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:23.752
Mr. Galifianakis?

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:24.747
Yes?

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:26.212
Your television contract.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.330
[pen clicks]

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:30.917
For one big, fancy network talk show.

01:09:36.417 --> 01:09:37.417
[laughing]

01:09:37.457 --> 01:09:38.858
What is this? What... what is this?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.920
I was fucking with you!

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.420
- What, you mean...
- You know why I was fucking with you?

01:09:44.042 --> 01:09:46.381
Because that's what celebrities
do to each other.

01:09:47.542 --> 01:09:48.921
You were just Clooney-ed.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
What?

01:09:50.082 --> 01:09:50.962
You won.

01:09:51.042 --> 01:09:52.962
I'm getting my own network talk show?

01:09:53.042 --> 01:09:54.882
You're about to be a TV star!

01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:57.168
- [Carol laughing]
- [exclaims] God Almighty!

01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:59.330
- Yeah!
- On TV, not the internet?

01:09:59.417 --> 01:10:01.037
[Boom Boom] My God! Zach!

01:10:01.125 --> 01:10:02.825
- Yeah!
- You did it! [laughing]

01:10:02.917 --> 01:10:03.917
So exciting.

01:10:10.208 --> 01:10:11.458
My two ferns...

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.582
you know, they were destroyed and...

01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:18.168
I don't know if I can
do a show without them.

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:20.080
You sign that contract...

01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:22.382
and I'll give you something

01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:24.325
way better than two ferns.

01:10:25.208 --> 01:10:26.208
Three ferns?

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.543
- Twenty?
- No, four ferns

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:31.625
Four fer...

01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:33.793
- Four ferns?
- Four ferns!

01:10:33.917 --> 01:10:35.667
[all celebrating]

01:10:36.042 --> 01:10:37.672

01:10:39.292 --> 01:10:42.172
USA! USA!

01:11:08.167 --> 01:11:09.667
What's going on, Zachy G?

01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:12.458
Okay,

01:11:12.708 --> 01:11:15.038
let's get to our very first guest ever.

01:11:15.583 --> 01:11:16.833
According to Wikipedia,

01:11:16.917 --> 01:11:18.667
she is 5 ft. 10,

01:11:18.792 --> 01:11:21.132
and was born April 30th, 1985.

01:11:21.417 --> 01:11:24.127
Please welcome our guest, Gal Gadot!

01:11:24.583 --> 01:11:25.673
Oh, Gal!

01:11:25.917 --> 01:11:28.207
[audience cheering]

01:11:28.333 --> 01:11:30.253
- Hey! How are you?
- Hi.

01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:31.173
Ooh.

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:33.250
[laughs politely]

01:11:33.375 --> 01:11:34.375
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:11:34.417 --> 01:11:35.827
Thank you so much for having me.

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:36.957
Hey, everyone.

01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:38.955
Ah.

01:11:39.042 --> 01:11:41.002
Oh, how wonderful is this?

01:11:41.083 --> 01:11:42.673
Gal Gadot's here!

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:45.250
Thank you so much for having me,

01:11:45.333 --> 01:11:49.173
and I'm so honored
to be the first guest on your first show.

01:11:49.708 --> 01:11:51.878
I've never been someone's first before,
so that's...

01:11:51.958 --> 01:11:53.628
[laughter]

01:11:53.708 --> 01:11:55.378
All right, so, uh, Gal,

01:11:55.583 --> 01:11:57.713
here comes my first question.

01:11:58.917 --> 01:12:01.287
Now, Gal, you played Wonder Woman.

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:02.827
[cheerfully] I'm wondering, woman,

01:12:02.958 --> 01:12:03.828
how fun was that?

01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:06.287
[laughter]

01:12:06.542 --> 01:12:09.672
It was amazing, it was so much fun.

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:12.080
[cheering]

01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:16.455
[beat playing]

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:19.827
[cheering continues]

01:12:32.042 --> 01:12:35.212
[beat and cheering continues]

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.040
The ratings are solid
in all four quadrants.

01:12:41.125 --> 01:12:42.665
A slight dip in seniors over 80,

01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.510
but you make up for it
with pregnant mothers,

01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:46.382
which technically
counts as watching for two.

01:12:47.125 --> 01:12:47.995
Oh, hey, guys.

01:12:48.083 --> 01:12:49.463
Can I have a minute with them?

01:12:49.542 --> 01:12:50.542
Sure.

01:12:52.708 --> 01:12:53.578
You saw that, huh?

01:12:53.667 --> 01:12:54.667
- Yeah, we did.
- Yeah.

01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:55.788
What was that all about?

01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:57.285
I thought it was so good!

01:12:57.583 --> 01:12:59.753
I mean, did you see the chemistry
between me and Gal?

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:01.422
It was unbelievable,

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.290
the back-and-forth we had.

01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:04.768
I don't think that's what Carol meant.

01:13:04.792 --> 01:13:06.922
Yeah, it's different
from what you usually do.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.130
Okay, yeah, all right, so,

01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:10.708
Mr. Ferrell and I talked about the old me,

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:14.293
and the old me
is not gonna work for this, you guys.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.880
This is the new me, this is the new ZG.

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:18.628
Celebrities don't wanna be insulted,

01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:20.788
they just wanna talk
about their fascinating lives.

01:13:20.917 --> 01:13:22.747
But, don't you kind of feel
like a sell-out?

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:24.153
Can you really call it a sell-out

01:13:24.208 --> 01:13:26.208
when they give you a free Tesla
for doing the show?

01:13:26.292 --> 01:13:28.422
That's literally
the definition of selling out.

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.500
Zach, do you really
wanna be like Will Ferrell?

01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:31.923
Some washed-up has-been

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.210
who takes cameos in Hollywood movies

01:13:34.292 --> 01:13:36.172
just to get another day's worth
of cocaine?

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:39.670
You know, I didn't even like you
before we took this trip to Hollywood,

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:42.420
but at least then I knew who you were.

01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:45.325
I don't know who this person is
that you're pretending to be.

01:13:46.833 --> 01:13:48.463
So, are you just saying that I should...

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:51.078
just forget everything? Just...

01:13:52.458 --> 01:13:54.668
just drop my dreams, my childhood dreams?

01:13:55.667 --> 01:13:56.537
[door opening]

01:13:56.667 --> 01:13:59.377
Zach, we need you on set
to shoot promos for tomorrow's show.

01:14:00.708 --> 01:14:03.378
Zach, we're leaving. We're going
to drive back to North Carolina.

01:14:03.458 --> 01:14:05.878
Shirl called and said
they rebuilt the studio.

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:07.625
We can have our old jobs back.

01:14:08.417 --> 01:14:10.497
Carol, you're the one
that told me never to give up.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.790
I know, and I still believe in you, Zach,
but...

01:14:15.125 --> 01:14:16.205
this isn't you.

01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:19.248
Zach? Are you coming?

01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:28.712
[melancholy music playing]

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Hey, guys!

01:14:50.417 --> 01:14:51.877
Wait for me! I had to get my ferns.

01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:52.828
- [Boom Boom] Zach!
- [Carol] What?

01:14:52.917 --> 01:14:54.997
We thought you chose the show over us?

01:14:55.167 --> 01:14:57.167
What, just 'cause I walked
into the studio silently

01:14:57.208 --> 01:14:58.748
without telling you what I was doing?

01:14:58.833 --> 01:14:59.833
Have more faith.

01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:01.287
Of course I'm going with you guys!

01:15:01.375 --> 01:15:02.745
- You're coming?
- Yes!

01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:04.293
- You're coming with us?
- Yes!

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.575
All right! Let's go. Let's go.

01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:07.667
[Boob Boom] Yes!

01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:09.832
Carol, you were right.

01:15:10.333 --> 01:15:11.833
Hollywood's not for us.

01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:15.165
It has a need to sanitize everything,

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:17.380
to slap a happy ending on everything.

01:15:17.458 --> 01:15:19.168
So, let's get out of here

01:15:19.583 --> 01:15:21.543
and drive off into the sunset together.

01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:24.245
'Cause all I need are my friends,

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:25.750
my show,

01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:27.208
and my ferns.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:28.630
[crunching]

01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:34.918
We'll just get some new ones.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.710
- I'll drive.
- Okay.

01:15:36.792 --> 01:15:40.332
<i>[Between Two Ferns</i> theme playing]

01:15:43.875 --> 01:15:45.785
Bradley Co... Bradley Coper.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:47.893
- Cooper. Yeah.
- Bradly Cooper co-wrote,

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:50.207
produced, directed
and starred in <i>A Star Is Born.</i>

01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:51.132
I haven't seen it.

01:15:51.208 --> 01:15:54.078
Are you hoping that will open doors
for other hot idiots?

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:57.205
[both laughing]

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.330
It's such a good question!

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:02.750
[Zach snorting]

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:03.673
So sorry.

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:05.332
- Oh...
- I'm so sorry.

01:16:05.417 --> 01:16:06.627
Let's take that one back.

01:16:06.708 --> 01:16:09.378
And, uh, we had this young woman,

01:16:09.542 --> 01:16:11.422
heroic young woman, Malala...

01:16:12.292 --> 01:16:13.672
uh, on the show,

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:15.330
and, um...

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:18.670
Known the world over,
not big in North America.

01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:20.630
You, I can tell by that look

01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:22.428
that you have no idea
who I'm talking about.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.340
- Yeah, I know who you're talking about.
- Who?

01:16:24.458 --> 01:16:25.958
Adam Carolla, is that who you said?

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:30.423
[both laughing]

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.080
That's why I have this look on my face.

01:16:33.333 --> 01:16:34.173
Wow.

01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:35.410
If you didn't have an accent,

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:38.458
do you think people would be able
to tell that you're not a very good actor?

01:16:38.667 --> 01:16:41.827
[both laughing]

01:16:44.542 --> 01:16:45.542
Please keep going.

01:16:46.083 --> 01:16:48.083
I read online that you're very private

01:16:48.167 --> 01:16:50.747
and decline to answer questions
that make you feel uncomfortable.

01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:52.043
This is a two-parter.

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:55.500
Is that true? And how old were you
when you got your period?

01:16:55.625 --> 01:16:57.625
[laughing]

01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.880
Do you ever go to the DMZ?

01:17:00.708 --> 01:17:03.378
- No.
- It's a combination of TMZ and the DMV.

01:17:03.458 --> 01:17:05.418
That's just a bunch of people...

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:06.920
sitting around...

01:17:07.083 --> 01:17:08.543
[laughing]

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:11.705
talking about their drivers' licenses.

01:17:12.042 --> 01:17:13.542
[both laughing]

01:17:14.167 --> 01:17:16.287
Talking about celebrity drivers' licenses.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.000
"Oh, my gosh,
she's got a C-class on hers."

01:17:21.333 --> 01:17:22.333
"Oh...

01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:25.328
James Franco wears corrective lenses."

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:28.540
[laughing]

01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:30.998
[snorts]

01:17:31.083 --> 01:17:33.133
- You used to live in your car.
- Yeah.

01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:35.290
Is it as fun as it sounds,
or is there a downside?

01:17:35.375 --> 01:17:37.495
[both laughing]

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.210
Would you say that your work
in <i>La La Land</i>

01:17:44.542 --> 01:17:45.752
really helped pave the way

01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:48.213
for white people
to explain jazz to black people?

01:17:48.292 --> 01:17:49.292
Sorry!

01:17:49.375 --> 01:17:51.375
[laughing]
[Zach snorts]

01:17:53.958 --> 01:17:55.838
All right. Let me get that out.
Sorry, you guys.

01:17:55.875 --> 01:17:57.915
We'll be right back
with <i>Who Gives A Shit?</i>

01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:00.625
[laughing]

01:18:01.917 --> 01:18:04.377
I mean, what, did you
read something last night

01:18:04.458 --> 01:18:06.748
and were so eager to come
tell a bunch of young people

01:18:06.833 --> 01:18:08.133
about what you read?

01:18:08.208 --> 01:18:09.538
[laughing]

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:10.880
Yes, I did.

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:12.918
I did do a lot of reading.

01:18:13.042 --> 01:18:15.962
When you and Woody Harrelson
are acting in a scene together,

01:18:16.042 --> 01:18:19.082
are you sad that somewhere
there's a sack not being hackied?

01:18:19.417 --> 01:18:21.417
[laughing]

01:18:24.292 --> 01:18:25.292
That's good.

01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:27.038
"A sack not being hackied."

01:18:27.542 --> 01:18:30.002
What was the marijuana budget
on <i>True Detective?</i>

01:18:30.083 --> 01:18:32.083
[laughing]

01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:35.208
And are you...

01:18:35.333 --> 01:18:37.013
Have you smoked
a lot of that budget today?

01:18:38.542 --> 01:18:39.542
Oh, shit.

01:18:39.625 --> 01:18:41.455
- You know a guy that has a Tesla?
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:42.542
[whistles]

01:18:42.875 --> 01:18:44.285
[laughter]

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.580
I won the EGOF.

01:18:45.708 --> 01:18:46.538
Hmm?

01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:47.955
- You know what an EGOT is?
- No.

01:18:48.083 --> 01:18:50.253
Oh, an EGOT! Stupid!

01:18:50.875 --> 01:18:52.665
It's amazing that this is even a thing.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
An EGOT?

01:18:54.042 --> 01:18:54.882
Or this thing?

01:18:54.958 --> 01:18:55.998
- This.
- [laughing]

01:18:56.083 --> 01:18:58.543
I wasn't talking about the EGOT!
I really...

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.327
[laughing]

01:19:00.417 --> 01:19:02.787
I was talking about this. Exactly.

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:07.038
There's a kid on the Disney Channel.

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.080
Uh, Chad...

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:10.330
Farthouse.

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:12.667
He's on one of...
<i>Wizards Of Waverly Place.</i>

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:16.332
[snickering]

01:19:17.542 --> 01:19:19.101
- [Zach] Your face...
- How does anybody do this?

01:19:19.125 --> 01:19:20.125
- Sorry.
- Your face.

01:19:20.167 --> 01:19:21.377
- Sorry.
- ...is not helping.

01:19:21.458 --> 01:19:23.038
Chad Far... [laughs]

01:19:24.458 --> 01:19:25.458
Do you hear that?

01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:26.955
No, I don't hear anything.

01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:28.708
That is the sound of everybody

01:19:28.792 --> 01:19:31.212
talking about your performance
in <i>Big Little Lies.</i>

01:19:32.917 --> 01:19:33.957
[whispering] No one cares.

01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:36.500
[laughing]

01:19:36.583 --> 01:19:37.583
It's so mean!

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.300
Your parents got divorced
when you were seven.

01:19:42.208 --> 01:19:43.208
Was that your fault?

01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:45.290
[laughs]

01:19:45.833 --> 01:19:46.673
And guess why?

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:50.210
They named their daughter
after a fucking piece of cheese.

01:19:50.333 --> 01:19:52.083
[laughing]

01:19:53.125 --> 01:19:55.825
Again, I'd like to thank
crystal meth Santa Claus for being here.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
[laughing]

01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:03.168
Don Draper's suit
hangs in the Smithsonian Museum

01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:04.309
- Yes, it does.
- It's an honor.

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:06.333
- Yeah!
- Right next to the Cosby sweaters?

01:20:06.458 --> 01:20:09.418
[guffawing]

01:20:17.708 --> 01:20:19.168
- Okay.
- No!

01:20:19.375 --> 01:20:21.075
What advice would you
give to a young actor

01:20:21.167 --> 01:20:23.457
who wants to hide his Jewishness
as well as you have?

01:20:23.833 --> 01:20:25.833
[laughing]

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.880
You know what happens
when a Jewish guy

01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:39.253
walks into a brick wall
with a full erection?

01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:42.167
- What?
- He breaks his nose.

01:20:42.292 --> 01:20:43.672
[laughs]

01:20:44.333 --> 01:20:45.633
I knew that was the answer!

01:20:46.958 --> 01:20:48.538
I did too, and I laughed!

01:20:48.625 --> 01:20:51.345
- I've told that joke for 20...
- Did you just come up with the joke?

01:20:51.708 --> 01:20:53.248
That's a joke you've told before?

01:20:53.375 --> 01:20:54.785
[both laughing]

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:03.625
And...

01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:05.543
that's the end of your movie, right?

01:21:05.958 --> 01:21:07.248
Yeah. And cut.

01:21:07.708 --> 01:21:10.328
Thanks, guys, thank you very much
for your time. Thank you.

01:21:10.458 --> 01:21:12.328
Thank you so much for doing this. Uh...

01:21:12.458 --> 01:21:15.168
I think it's gonna be good.
I hope my professor gives me an A.

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:16.250
What?

01:21:17.292 --> 01:21:18.972
Your professor?
What are you talking about?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.630
Yeah, this is a student film.

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.675
I'm a student
at Appalachian State University.

01:21:22.875 --> 01:21:23.955
Student film?

01:21:24.292 --> 01:21:25.882
Yeah, I told you that at the beginning.

01:21:25.958 --> 01:21:27.498
So, nobody's gonna see this?

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:29.460
Well, my professor's gonna see it.

01:21:29.667 --> 01:21:30.667
And the students.

01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:32.309
There's, like, 12 people in my class.

01:21:32.333 --> 01:21:33.543
And I'll show my parents.

01:21:35.083 --> 01:21:36.603
Get the fuck out of my office, please.

01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:38.330
Excuse me?

01:21:38.417 --> 01:21:40.327
Get the fudge out of my office, please.

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:43.768
I said "fuck" the first time, now I'm
saying "fudge" 'cause it's more polite,

01:21:43.792 --> 01:21:45.252
but get the fuck out of my office.

01:21:45.458 --> 01:21:47.128
Geez. Sorry.

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.080
[yelling] It could've been in 3D!
