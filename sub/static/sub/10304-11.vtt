01:59.280 --> 02:02.670
Margaret, l'm down
to my last bite of lunch.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.195
Where the hell's my dinner?

02:05.440 --> 02:06.668
Coming, Mom.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.714
l'm just trying to add some fruit
to make sure you have a balanced diet.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.558
Well, make it quick.
My stomach is starting to growl.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.390
Hey, Bud, hurry up with that beer.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.593
l don't think the foundation can hold
another one of Grandma's belly quakes.

02:29.320 --> 02:33.632
She'll calm down soon. l put some
Valium in with the mixed nuts.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.917
Hey, Grandma, pull it up
on the count of three. Okay?

02:38.160 --> 02:41.630
-One, two--
-Hey, Grandma, hey!

02:42.760 --> 02:45.991
Hey, kid, get off my ham.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.152
Kelly!

02:50.200 --> 02:52.998
Bud, if you wanna get from
Grandma's room to the basement...

02:53.200 --> 02:55.634
...you should probably
use the stairs.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.957
Hey, Peg.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.835
You know what l was dreaming about
at work today?

03:13.520 --> 03:14.873
Me, Al?

03:15.120 --> 03:16.473
Yes, Peg.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.829
-Was l in bed?
-Yes, you were.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.953
ln fact, l tied you up.

03:25.480 --> 03:30.076
Oh, well, that sounds so kinky, Al.
What were you doing?

03:30.320 --> 03:32.231
Cindy Crawford.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.949
Hey, Peg, where's my beer?

03:40.480 --> 03:42.994
Maybe Cindy drank it.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.916
Recycle those, please.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.436
lsn't that great, Al?
She's trying to save the earth.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.558
She is the earth, Peg.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.269
Peg, l'm telling you...

03:58.480 --> 04:01.631
...me and the floorboards
can't take any more of her.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.071
Al, why are you so negative
about my mom?

04:05.320 --> 04:08.471
l love her, and the kids
are thrilled that she's around.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.553
Dad, we hate Grandma.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.039
She must go.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.190
That's it.
l'm calling a family meeting.

04:16.399 --> 04:19.790
All in favour of getting rid
of Grandma raise your hands.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.996
All opposed.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.596
lt's unanimous, she goes.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.918
Have a heart, Al.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.588
lf it wasn't for Mom,
l wouldn't even be alive.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.229
Look, the only way that you are getting
my mother out of this house...

04:41.440 --> 04:43.954
...is if my daddy comes
and takes her home to Wanker.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.158
Peg, l've asked that idiot
a million times to come take her back.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.079
-He won't listen to me.
-Well, of course he won't.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.676
Wanker elders
live by a very strict code.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.150
'' Marry fat, marry family''?

04:57.480 --> 04:59.436
No, Al. The code is:

04:59.680 --> 05:03.070
''Only listen to someone
who is as much man as you are.''

05:03.320 --> 05:05.231
So if you want Mom
out of this house...

05:05.440 --> 05:08.432
...you are gonna have to find a way
to prove yourself to my dad.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.238
Hey, wait, wait. l got an idea.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.278
Now, what does Grandpa
love to do more than anything?

05:13.520 --> 05:16.318
Stand by the roadside
and flash cars?

05:18.040 --> 05:20.634
No, besides that. Go hunting.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.879
Bud, will you come on?
You're slowing us down.

05:50.240 --> 05:54.836
-Think you could help me out a bit?
-All right. Let me lighten your load.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.751
This trail mix here,
now this is good stuff.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.191
-You want some, Ephraim?
-No, no, no.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.789
l always hunt on an empty stomach.

06:05.040 --> 06:08.271
That way the alcohol hits you harder.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.877
Well, what are we hunting today,
Ephraim?

06:14.120 --> 06:15.951
Possum? Squirrel?

06:16.200 --> 06:18.509
Some other one of your relatives?

06:19.360 --> 06:23.638
No, Mr. Can't-Blow-His-Nose-
Without-A-Kleenex.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.070
We are hunting bear.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.639
Bear?

06:28.880 --> 06:30.950
Call me stupid,
but why are we hunting bear?

06:31.200 --> 06:33.589
Well, stupid...

06:35.440 --> 06:39.638
...just asking them to kill themselves
doesn't seem to be working.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.836
Dad, this is nuts.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.430
lsn't there a nudie bar around Wanker
we could take him to prove we're men?

06:46.680 --> 06:47.635
Son, there is.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.673
But Wanker strippers are scarier
than anything in these woods.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.238
Now, listen, son. l was raised
on the mean streets of Chicago.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.634
Nothing scares me.

06:56.840 --> 07:00.515
ln the darkest realm of night,
l've stared right in the face of hell...

07:00.760 --> 07:04.116
...and l've said,
'' Peg, can't you get some sleep?''

07:05.360 --> 07:07.351
So nothing scares me, boy.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.831
You're right, Dad. You're right.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.638
Let's go bag us a bear.

07:11.880 --> 07:15.350
Let's show this country codger
what city smarts are all about.

07:15.680 --> 07:19.355
Oh, l wouldn't venture
in there if l was you, boys.

07:20.120 --> 07:24.352
Chill out, Grandpa, and make us a fire.
We're bringing home some dinner.

07:24.720 --> 07:28.872
Judging from the way those branches
are broken, l'd say the bear is a--

07:29.480 --> 07:33.678
-Oh, my God, we're gonna die!
-A bear! A bear!

07:43.040 --> 07:46.919
l can't believe that worthless geezer
left us here on our own.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.752
Well, to be fair, he left us a map.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.675
Unfortunately,
it's a map of Epcot Center.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.273
The important thing here, son,
is to get some rest.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.556
First light, we'll find the car...

08:08.760 --> 08:10.716
...we'll hit the road,
track Grandpa down...

08:10.920 --> 08:12.751
...and turn him into road kill.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.874
Good night, son.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.838
Good night, Pop.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.076
Jeez, it's lumpier
than sleeping with your mother.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.432
How come you're so comfortable,
Bud?

08:35.000 --> 08:39.515
Well, because l brought
an air mattress with me.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.759
Dad.

09:03.440 --> 09:04.589
l know we're city tough...

09:04.800 --> 09:08.429
...and as an extra precaution
you hung your socks from the branch...

09:10.160 --> 09:12.720
...but in case that bear
does come back...

09:13.280 --> 09:14.918
...l just want you to know...

09:15.160 --> 09:16.957
...l love you, man.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.079
You're not getting my beer, Bud.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.434
Now try and get some sleep.

09:29.080 --> 09:32.117
l'd sleep a lot better if l knew
a little more about these woods.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.713
Well, what's there to know?

09:33.960 --> 09:37.919
You hid all the food from the bears
in your sleeping bag, didn't you?

09:39.720 --> 09:42.439
Yeah, just like you told me.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.759
Fine.
Then everything will be all right.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.718
Good night, son.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.239
Good night.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.476
-What's that?
-Just an owl. Good night.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.478
That's cool.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.988
Just crickets, right?

10:10.200 --> 10:13.033
That's right, nighty-night.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.513
Good night.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.750
Leave us alone!

10:47.160 --> 10:49.071
Dad, l hit something.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.072
l hit something.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.317
-lt's a-- lt's a bear!
-lt's a bear!

10:57.520 --> 10:59.636
-lt's a bear!
-lt's a big bear!

11:08.920 --> 11:11.229
lt's dead. l killed a bear!

11:11.480 --> 11:13.914
Son, do you realize
what this means?

11:14.160 --> 11:17.516
This is an opportunity for us
to show Grandpa that we're men.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.751
See, we track him down,
we show him the bear.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.672
Then he's gotta take
Jabba the Hutt...

11:21.880 --> 11:24.713
...back to that Star Wars bar
where she belongs.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.039
Son, what are you doing with that?

11:34.520 --> 11:36.715
Daniel Boone was a man

11:36.920 --> 11:40.515
He was a big man

11:41.760 --> 11:44.672
-Are we not men?
-We are manly men.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.996
l can't wait to show Grandpa
what we got.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.589
He's never gonna believe
we actually killed a bear.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.836
Grandma Wank er was a woman

11:52.040 --> 11:54.759
She was a big woman

11:55.120 --> 12:00.148
With the breath of a wino
And chins of a rhino was she

12:02.920 --> 12:06.037
Daddy is gonna be so happy
we got him all this beer.

12:06.280 --> 12:09.636
But l don't understand
why it cost 50 bucks.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.474
Well, it was $20 for the beer...

12:12.720 --> 12:16.872
...then there was the $30
that l tipped the clerk for carding me.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.949
Hey, Mom, do you think
Dad's gonna be successful...

12:21.160 --> 12:23.151
...getting Grandma
and Grandpa back together?

12:23.360 --> 12:26.796
Yeah, l hope so.
They used to be so happy.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.715
l mean, look. Here's a picture
of Grandpa on a seesaw.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.236
Now, here's one of Grandma
getting on the seesaw.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.473
Oh, and here's Grandpa flying
over the power lines.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.717
-Oh, look, their wedding photos.
-Yeah.

12:42.920 --> 12:46.196
There's Grandma taking the first bite
of the wedding cake...

12:46.440 --> 12:49.557
...which also happened to be
the last bite of the cake.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.115
Mom, do you think
that will ever happen to me?

12:52.320 --> 12:53.912
What? Getting married?

12:54.160 --> 12:57.197
No. Gaining 7 00 pounds.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.237
Daniel Boone was a man

12:59.440 --> 13:01.954
He was a big man

13:04.920 --> 13:06.239
Look what we got.

13:06.480 --> 13:10.359
Wow, cool, a wheelbarrow.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.958
Oh, Daddy. Al did it.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.720
-He convinced you he was a man.
-Yes, sir.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.593
He proved to me
that he can tame wild animals...

13:19.800 --> 13:23.031
...better than Siegfried and Roy
put together.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.154
Which is a picture l'm trying
to get out of my head right now.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.795
Peg, l killed him
with these bare hands.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.590
Oh, Al.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.719
l always knew that your feet
were lethal, but l had no idea.

13:38.920 --> 13:42.959
Peg, Peg, please l've been
in the woods. l'm dirty enough.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.520
Besides, Ephraim and l
had a little discussion...

13:46.720 --> 13:48.631
...and he's decided to do something.

13:48.880 --> 13:52.634
Margaret, l have come to pick up
my darling baby bride.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.429
Oh, Daddy.
You really do miss her, don't you?

13:56.680 --> 13:58.238
l do.

14:00.080 --> 14:04.073
l wouldn't want to see her
in a bikini again, but l do miss her.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.675
Yeah, that's why l've come...

14:06.880 --> 14:10.156
...to hang a wide-load banner
on her backside and ride her on home.

14:15.240 --> 14:18.676
Guys, we better get her packed
before Grandpa changes his mind.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.438
Ephy, darling. ls that you?

14:22.680 --> 14:26.229
Yeah, Mama.
l'm coming to free Willy.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.354
Live bear.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.878
Big live bear.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.958
If I were Lassie, I'd bark real loud
and alert the family...

14:54.200 --> 14:58.352
...but since I haven't been fed in weeks,
the hell with them.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.753
Bye, bye, bear.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.593
l guess that's
the last of the luggage.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.070
l got the Fudgsicles here.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.512
l got the Klondike bars.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.228
l got the Eskimo Pies.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.310
Well, l can hardly wait
to get the little woman home.

15:22.520 --> 15:27.116
Yeah, you better leave
before her luggage melts.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.511
Don't worry,
she'll have this scarfed down...

15:29.720 --> 15:31.676
...before we get
to the end of the driveway.

15:32.480 --> 15:37.190
Oh, Al, have you noticed something?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.875
Big hairy animal.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.868
Oh, darn, Bud. Thank you.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.435
Peg, you got your hair done.
lt looks nice.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.397
The bear is gone, Daniel Goon.

15:56.360 --> 16:00.956
Wait a minute, maybe Mr. He-Man,
didn't kill that bear after all.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.758
Maybe he was just hibernating.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.275
l know the difference
between hibernating and dead.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.674
That bear was dead.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.314
My wife is hibernating.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.675
Hey, Marcie, did you see some guy
dragging off my dead bear?

16:18.920 --> 16:22.276
He's not dead, you chucklehead.

16:22.600 --> 16:26.434
He just violated my Mercedes.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.596
How do you know?

16:32.880 --> 16:36.998
Because we were in it.

16:38.200 --> 16:41.590
-Marcie, are you okay?
-l'm all right.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.037
A little in shock and a little jealous.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.236
Jealous?

16:47.480 --> 16:52.349
Well, you should have seen him
go and go and go and go.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.638
Oh, my God, if a car could smile.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.389
One thing l know for sure.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.718
Tonight, Jefferson,
we're playing Buick and the Beast.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.314
l don't know, Marcie.
l may need some counselling.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.597
And l think you're gonna have to do
all the work for a while.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.108
l'm not gonna do it....

17:12.880 --> 17:16.316
Well, l'd like to hear a little more
about your menage à bear...

17:16.560 --> 17:20.519
...but Ephraim here has to forklift
his bride across the threshold.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.159
Are you crazy?

17:22.400 --> 17:26.075
Leave that horndog of a bear
rampaging this city?

17:26.280 --> 17:29.033
Mama can wait.
We gotta track that bear down.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.078
Hey, you guys,
l saw this documentary once...

17:32.320 --> 17:37.633
...where the park ranger captured
the bear by putting out a picnic basket.

17:42.240 --> 17:47.553
Kel, did this documentary perhaps
take place in Jellystone National Park?

17:48.200 --> 17:50.555
Yeah. Did you see it too?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.879
Well, since there's nobody here
who's man enough...

17:56.080 --> 17:58.719
...l guess l'll have to track
that bear down myself.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.837
Oh, and Al, promise me one thing.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.359
lf anything happens to me...

18:02.560 --> 18:05.233
...you take care of my bride
forever and ever.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.910
Bud, get in the car.
We're going hunting again.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.789
Hey, hey, Ephraim. Slow down.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.712
We're not in the woods anymore.

18:32.960 --> 18:36.077
What are you talking about?
Bear hunting is bear hunting.

18:36.320 --> 18:40.472
Now, why don't you 1 0-fingered
nose-breathers just let me handle this.

18:40.680 --> 18:44.514
All right? l can--
Wait a minute. There he is.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.551
He's mine.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.038
Pervert.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.598
Get out of the way!

18:53.800 --> 18:55.791
Beat it!

19:01.880 --> 19:05.111
You know, something tells me
l'm not in Wanker anymore.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.677
You can say that again.
This is the city, Ephraim, the big city.

19:09.920 --> 19:15.358
My turf. Now, we're gonna
catch that bear my way.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.629
Look.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.671
The bear's been here.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.034
Which direction did he go?

19:48.040 --> 19:51.919
Dad, l think the guy
needs some help.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.957
-Are you really stuck in there?
-Yeah.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.917
He's close.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.038
How can you tell?

20:12.280 --> 20:16.273
Because no human could possibly
drink more then one Zima.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.199
Hey, Dad, look, look, look.

20:22.240 --> 20:26.028
Good evening, gentlemen.
l see you've met our friend.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.150
Yogi's with us, man. So beat it.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.238
-Yeah. Scram.
-Get lost, buddy.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.236
Bud, hold my coat.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.632
Hold our coats, Grandpa.

20:40.840 --> 20:45.595
Oh, boy.
Al, why don't you let this one G-O?

20:45.840 --> 20:49.594
There's plenty of other bears
in the W-O-D-S.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.558
Ephraim.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.755
My turf.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.758
Any last words, punk?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.389
Yeah, you're wife is good in bed.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.876
So you're a liar too?

21:05.520 --> 21:07.636
Go get them. Go get them.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.871
Look out, Dad, over here.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.556
Dad, look out. Look out.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.672
-You all right?
-l'm all right, boy.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.274
Wow, that was really something.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.675
-Thanks, Ephraim.
-See you.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.632
''See you''?
What do you mean, ''see you''?

21:34.880 --> 21:36.632
We're going back
and collect your wife.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.632
Oh, l'm not gonna do that, Al.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.319
What do you mean not gonna do it?

21:40.520 --> 21:42.795
Ephraim, didn't l prove to you
that l'm a real man?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.798
Yeah, but you also proved
that l'm not one.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.753
And until l can be a man
just like you...

21:48.960 --> 21:52.430
...l don't deserve a little bride
like Mama.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.428
Wait a second, Ephraim.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.596
You're the most courageous man
l know.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.751
Why, you've seen
that woman naked...

21:58.960 --> 22:01.599
...and you're still around
to tell about it.

22:01.880 --> 22:06.112
Hey, l seen her in a nightie one time,
my pupils are still dilated.

22:07.440 --> 22:11.228
Those are kind words, Al,
but l know when l'm licked.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.436
l'll come back for mama sometime.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.275
ln the meantime, you just remember
she needs nine squares a day.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.631
l knew we should have killed him
in the woods when we had the chance.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.997
Wait a second.
Maybe all is not lost, look.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.709
Well, that's good, son,
but we don't have any money.

22:35.960 --> 22:38.520
l don't think we'll be needing any.
