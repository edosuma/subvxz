00:05.800 --> 00:08.340
Princess Celestia! We came
as fast as we could.

00:08.341 --> 00:12.980
I need you to wield the Elements
of Harmony once again and stop Discord.

00:12.981 --> 00:14.837
The Elements! They're gone!

00:16.753 --> 00:19.415
Everypony has to play
or the game is over.

00:19.416 --> 00:21.347
And I win.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.795
Our friendship... over?

00:23.796 --> 00:24.982
Who were you talking to?

00:24.983 --> 00:27.907
Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.

00:27.908 --> 00:28.809
What?

00:28.810 --> 00:31.714
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you.

00:31.715 --> 00:34.004
WHY? Need a good laugh?

00:34.005 --> 00:36.941
What is happening to my friends?

00:36.942 --> 00:42.517
Looks like we might be due
for a big old storm of chaos.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

01:32.136 --> 01:34.124
And what are YOU laughing at?!

01:35.405 --> 01:39.092
You ponies are just
the most fun I've had in aeons.

01:39.093 --> 01:40.270
Well, QUIT IT!!!

01:40.271 --> 01:43.372
You better think
before you laugh at the Pink!

01:43.828 --> 01:44.950
...kie Pie!

01:46.145 --> 01:47.485
Oh, yeah?

01:47.486 --> 01:48.904
Well, ha ha.

01:48.927 --> 01:49.904
Quit it!

01:49.905 --> 01:51.903
No. Ha ha.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.180
QUIT IT!!!

01:53.181 --> 01:56.062
No. Ha ha ha ha ha.

01:56.063 --> 01:57.240
Uh, Rarity?

01:57.241 --> 01:58.816
This here diamond o' yours?

01:59.018 --> 02:02.648
Twilight said we should split it
six way, since we uh...

02:02.649 --> 02:03.576
...found it together.

02:04.303 --> 02:07.528
Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine!

02:08.684 --> 02:10.900
Girls, why are you
all acting like this?

02:10.901 --> 02:12.367
We need to stick together!

02:13.076 --> 02:15.436
It's just too entertaining.

02:16.599 --> 02:19.166
Stop it, Discord!
You're not playing fair.

02:19.167 --> 02:21.996
I'm not playing fair?
Perhaps we haven't met.

02:22.196 --> 02:26.548
I'm Discord. Spirit of chaos
and disharmony.

02:26.549 --> 02:27.860
Hellooo!

02:28.160 --> 02:30.241
How are we supposed to find
the Elements of Harmony...

02:30.242 --> 02:33.324
...when you took away the labyrinth
before we could get to the end?!

02:33.325 --> 02:34.859
Oh, wait! Did you...?

02:35.518 --> 02:36.792
How funny!

02:36.875 --> 02:39.691
You thought the Elements
were *in* the labyrinth?

02:43.971 --> 02:47.219
Twists and turns are my master plan...

02:47.220 --> 02:50.612
...then find the Elements
back where you began.

02:52.656 --> 02:55.435
I never said they
were in the labyrinth.

02:55.583 --> 02:56.928
But... But...

02:56.929 --> 02:58.917
Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle.

02:58.918 --> 03:01.982
♥ Maybe the magic of friendship ♥
can help you.

03:02.079 --> 03:05.306
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some chaos to wreak.

03:10.973 --> 03:13.807
Chocolate milk?! I hate chocolate milk!

03:15.702 --> 03:17.214
Think, Twilight, think!

03:17.215 --> 03:19.716
Find the Elements
back where you began...

03:19.717 --> 03:21.481
Back where you began...

03:21.482 --> 03:22.993
Don't touch my gem!

03:23.142 --> 03:25.917
I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha ha.

03:25.918 --> 03:27.266
What's you laughing at?!

03:27.267 --> 03:29.812
Ugh, I just wanna go home.

03:29.965 --> 03:31.051
Wait a minute...

03:31.827 --> 03:34.331
Home! Back where you began!

03:34.332 --> 03:36.065
The Elements must be in...

03:36.165 --> 03:37.781
...Ponyville!

03:38.229 --> 03:41.742
Come on, girls! I'm certain this is
what Discord's riddle really meant.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.442
If we get back to the library...

03:43.443 --> 03:46.035
...I have a book that I just know
can give us a clue.

03:50.579 --> 03:54.047
Good boy, Angel! Mama's so proud.

03:56.428 --> 03:59.601
Weeell, I can see so much better now.

04:05.207 --> 04:06.510
I meant to do that.

04:11.410 --> 04:13.881
Discord's turned our
dirt roads into soap!

04:15.630 --> 04:17.112
Beautiful, isn't it?

04:17.543 --> 04:19.798
This is the new and improved Ponyville.

04:19.798 --> 04:22.975
And these are only my first changes.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.009
This may look like fun, but it's not.

04:31.058 --> 04:34.283
Picture it, the chaos
capital of the world.

04:36.145 --> 04:38.719
I can't picture anything.
It's too dark.

04:40.169 --> 04:43.265
Well, wait a few minutes and you'll
see it in the beautiful light of day.

04:43.266 --> 04:44.323
Or not.

04:46.257 --> 04:48.962
Ponyville the chaos
capital of the world?

04:49.297 --> 04:51.416
Not if I have anything to say about it.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.514
Don't worry. You won't.

04:59.813 --> 05:05.164
Okay, we're here. Everyone please
please please just go inside, please?

05:05.165 --> 05:07.205
I absolutely refuse.

05:07.442 --> 05:08.885
With pleasure.

05:12.107 --> 05:13.827
I hate libraries.

05:20.038 --> 05:22.540
Pleeease, we gotta hurry!

05:22.541 --> 05:25.418
Forget it, Twilight.
I know what you're up to.

05:25.419 --> 05:29.689
The second I go in you'll have your
little minion Spike come and take Tom.

05:29.690 --> 05:32.677
-Tom?
-Well, it's not going to work!

05:35.392 --> 05:37.472
You're not going in
without him, are you?

05:40.147 --> 05:41.086
Fine!

05:55.173 --> 05:57.026
What'd you do that for, Fluttershy?

05:57.027 --> 05:59.106
Cause you just look so peaceful.

05:59.107 --> 06:00.279
I, uh...

06:01.926 --> 06:03.349
Careful, Twilight!

06:03.350 --> 06:05.425
You'll ruin his beautiful finish.

06:05.426 --> 06:06.812
Oh, for the love of...

06:06.813 --> 06:08.270
Twilight, what's going on?

06:08.271 --> 06:09.891
Why's everybody look so...

06:10.149 --> 06:11.025
...gray?

06:11.819 --> 06:14.606
Don't ask. I need you
to help me find something.

06:14.989 --> 06:18.023
Hey, Twilight? What's
soaking wet and clueless?

06:18.024 --> 06:20.432
Fluttershy, I've had just about enou...

06:21.215 --> 06:22.490
Your face!

06:24.104 --> 06:25.836
What's happened to everypony?

06:25.837 --> 06:28.380
I guess you just bring up
the worst in us, Spike.

06:29.282 --> 06:30.481
No time to explain.

06:30.482 --> 06:32.805
We've got to find the reference guide
to Elements of Harmony...

06:32.806 --> 06:35.710
...before somepony does
something she'll regret!

06:36.021 --> 06:37.781
The Elements of Harmony?

06:38.079 --> 06:39.976
Oh! I know exactly where that book is!

06:41.735 --> 06:42.759
Found it!

06:43.780 --> 06:44.447
Ha!

06:44.448 --> 06:48.033
Fluttershy... You better
give me that book!

06:48.520 --> 06:49.954
Keep away!

06:50.529 --> 06:51.191
Hey!

06:51.192 --> 06:52.735
Applejack! Give me that book!

06:52.736 --> 06:54.175
I don't have any book.

06:55.743 --> 06:56.666
Pinkie!

06:57.252 --> 06:58.786
You guys!

06:59.924 --> 07:01.712
Stop it right now!

07:06.398 --> 07:07.281
Mine!

07:07.282 --> 07:09.572
Hey! Do you even know
what you just stole?

07:09.573 --> 07:11.944
No, but if you want it, I want it.

07:13.899 --> 07:15.697
GIVE ME THAT BOOK!!!

07:22.844 --> 07:25.294
Where is she? Where is Rarity?

07:25.295 --> 07:26.236
Beats me.

07:26.420 --> 07:27.600
Lies!

07:35.252 --> 07:37.290
Get back! All of you!

07:37.291 --> 07:40.167
This is my book! AND I'M GONNA READ IT!

07:45.944 --> 07:47.356
The Elements!

07:56.735 --> 07:57.972
The Elements!

07:57.973 --> 07:59.961
They were here all along!

07:59.962 --> 08:00.867
This is great!

08:00.868 --> 08:03.860
Now you guys can defeat Discord
and put everything back to normal.

08:03.861 --> 08:07.582
See, girls? We did it! We've found
the Elements of Harmony!

08:07.583 --> 08:08.984
Together!

08:10.951 --> 08:12.363
You don't even care, do you?

08:12.364 --> 08:13.323
No.

08:13.982 --> 08:17.266
I never thought it would
happen. My friends...

08:17.919 --> 08:19.784
...have turned into complete jerks!

08:19.873 --> 08:23.247
Necklace... Necklace...
Necklace... Necklace...

08:23.493 --> 08:24.196
Aaand...

08:24.197 --> 08:27.350
...big crown-thingy.
Come on, everypony! Let's go!

08:27.499 --> 08:29.998
But, Twilight.
Aren't you missing somepony?

08:29.999 --> 08:33.332
Nope. We've got the liar, the grump,
the hoarded and the brute.

08:33.332 --> 08:34.388
That just about covers it.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.323
What about Rainbow Dash?

08:37.424 --> 08:40.796
Congratulations, Spike. You're
the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!

08:41.403 --> 08:42.316
Me?!

08:42.317 --> 08:45.198
B-b-but... what if she finds out
I've been impersonating her?

08:45.961 --> 08:47.221
That won't end well.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.971
Too bad. You're Rainbow Dash.

08:48.972 --> 08:52.391
Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't
ever have to talk to each other again.

08:52.522 --> 08:54.983
YEAH! WOOHOO!

08:58.129 --> 08:59.151
Move!

09:00.001 --> 09:02.645
Look out! Here comes Tom!

09:06.679 --> 09:11.211
Well, well, well. I see you've
found the Elements of Harmony.

09:11.212 --> 09:13.447
How terrifying!

09:13.448 --> 09:16.317
Discord! I've figured out
your lame riddle.

09:16.318 --> 09:18.010
You're in for it now!

09:18.224 --> 09:21.348
I certainly am. You've
clearly outduelled me.

09:21.349 --> 09:24.853
And now it's time to meet my fate.

09:24.854 --> 09:28.045
I'm prepared to be
defeated now, ladies.

09:28.046 --> 09:30.599
Fire when ready.

09:30.799 --> 09:32.697
Formation! Now!

09:35.528 --> 09:37.632
Rainbow Dash! Get over here!

09:39.388 --> 09:42.262
All right. Let's get this over with.

10:03.627 --> 10:04.763
What's going on?

10:04.764 --> 10:07.681
Mine's workin'. There must be
somethin' wrong with yours.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.136
I hate the Elements of Harmony!

10:10.780 --> 10:11.850
Garbage.

10:12.776 --> 10:13.723
MINE!

10:14.002 --> 10:17.700
Sorry, Twilight. I guess I better get
back upstairs and clean up the library.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.644
Good luck with all this... whoa!

10:21.339 --> 10:23.919
Oops. Sorry, Rainbow Crash.

10:24.761 --> 10:28.176
Bravo, ponies! Bravo!

10:28.177 --> 10:31.644
Harmony in Equestria
is officially dead.

10:31.645 --> 10:34.414
Discord rules, Celestia drools.

10:38.850 --> 10:41.039
It's your fault it didn't work!

10:41.040 --> 10:42.460
Who are you talking to?

10:42.461 --> 10:44.513
Any of you! All of you!

10:44.514 --> 10:45.796
I'm outta here!

10:46.247 --> 10:50.329
I better go too. I got new, better
friends waitin' for me at the farm.

10:51.742 --> 10:54.338
Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.

10:54.339 --> 10:57.099
Fine! Leave! See if I care.

10:57.100 --> 10:59.006
I don't need you guys either.

10:59.007 --> 11:01.469
With friends like you, who needs...

11:02.630 --> 11:03.849
...enemies.

11:27.535 --> 11:28.872
My stomach!

11:30.659 --> 11:33.842
Twilight, you've got to
see what I just did.

11:37.633 --> 11:39.770
It's priceless!

11:43.304 --> 11:48.276
Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've
got to get into the spirit of things.

11:49.110 --> 11:51.785
After all, this is your new home.

11:54.543 --> 11:56.038
Not anymore.

11:58.149 --> 11:59.703
YES!

12:07.947 --> 12:09.711
Pack your things, Spike. We're leaving.

12:12.032 --> 12:15.042
And don't ask where we're going,
'cause... I don't know yet.

12:15.043 --> 12:16.500
Just not here.

12:18.774 --> 12:20.674
Can't... move!

12:20.675 --> 12:23.327
The Princess...
has been sending these...

12:24.015 --> 12:26.302
...since I came back upstairs.

12:29.409 --> 12:31.612
Make it stop!

12:31.812 --> 12:33.621
These are all the letters
I've written to the Princess...

12:33.622 --> 12:35.591
...since I've lived in Ponyville.

12:36.076 --> 12:38.159
But why would she send them back?

12:40.167 --> 12:42.629
"Real friends don't care
what your cover is..."

12:42.630 --> 12:45.057
"Friendship is a wondrous
and powerful thing..."

12:45.058 --> 12:48.791
"And like the path cut through the orchard,
there'll be always a way through."

12:49.028 --> 12:51.347
"The best thing to do is
to stay true to yourself..."

12:51.348 --> 12:53.708
"...special magical connection
with her friends..."

12:53.709 --> 12:55.891
"...maybe even before she's met them."

12:56.400 --> 12:59.155
Spike! Spike, it's all so clear!

13:00.278 --> 13:03.925
Can't you see? Discord's trying to
distract us from what's important.

13:03.926 --> 13:06.379
He knows how powerful
our friendships are...

13:06.380 --> 13:08.671
...and he's trying to
keep us from seeing it.

13:09.193 --> 13:12.497
Do you remember what I said
the first day we arrived in Ponyville?

13:12.498 --> 13:16.321
I told you that the future of Equestria
didn't rest on me making friends.

13:16.322 --> 13:18.228
But the opposite is true!

13:18.229 --> 13:19.993
The friendships I've made
since I've been here...

13:19.994 --> 13:22.055
...would save Equestria
from Nightmare Moon.

13:22.056 --> 13:24.919
And now they need to
save it from Discord!

13:26.698 --> 13:28.073
You're right, Spike.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.122
I've got to fight for my friendships.

13:30.123 --> 13:34.127
For them. For me. For Equestria!

13:36.456 --> 13:38.410
Oh. Uh...

13:38.582 --> 13:41.026
Why don't you just stay here and rest?

13:41.027 --> 13:44.272
I'll take care of the whole fighting
for friendship thing myself.

14:08.295 --> 14:10.419
And so I tried to defeat Discord...

14:10.420 --> 14:14.471
...but none of my so-called friends
would lift a hoof to help me.

14:15.779 --> 14:19.041
Applejack! I'm here to fight
for our friendship.

14:22.340 --> 14:24.429
Oh. Now you wanna fight.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.807
Where were you when
I was battlin' Discord?

14:27.425 --> 14:28.822
Snap out of it!

14:29.428 --> 14:30.647
This isn't you!

14:30.648 --> 14:32.217
You're not a liar.

14:53.437 --> 14:55.697
Wha... What happened?

14:56.026 --> 14:57.040
Twilight!

14:57.604 --> 15:00.251
I saw a vision of us
feudin' and fightin'.

15:00.252 --> 15:03.689
I couldn't face the truth
so I started tellin' lies.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.505
Can you ever forgive me?

15:05.574 --> 15:07.116
I already have.

15:07.117 --> 15:08.237
Come on!

15:13.151 --> 15:14.640
Oh no!

15:14.924 --> 15:18.358
Twilight! Applejack!
I just had the worst dream!

15:19.413 --> 15:23.342
What do you think you're doing?
Get away from my gem! Get Away!

15:28.608 --> 15:30.576
Let us never speak of this again.

15:34.115 --> 15:36.494
Oh, and I... I turned gray!

15:37.011 --> 15:38.748
Can you believe it?

15:40.514 --> 15:41.888
She's not here.

15:42.006 --> 15:44.724
Without Rainbow Dash
we can't use the Elements.

15:44.725 --> 15:48.118
She could be anywhere by now.
We're never gonna find her.

15:48.119 --> 15:50.254
Yeah, we will. Cause she's right there.

15:50.255 --> 15:51.760
Rainbow Dash!

15:51.761 --> 15:52.907
Hey, guys!

15:53.043 --> 15:55.071
We've been looking everywhere for you.

15:55.358 --> 15:56.418
That's nice.

15:56.639 --> 15:58.181
Discord's still on the loose.

15:58.182 --> 16:01.594
We need you to help us defeat him
with your element: loyalty.

16:02.224 --> 16:03.979
Loyalty-schmoyalty.

16:03.980 --> 16:07.235
Have you guys seen Ponyville?
It's a disaster!

16:07.236 --> 16:10.819
I'm staying here in Cloudsdale
where everything is awesome.

16:10.820 --> 16:15.414
How in Equestria could she think that
tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?

16:15.644 --> 16:18.930
The same way he got you to think that
cheap rock was a bona fide diamond?

16:19.224 --> 16:21.993
I thought we agreed
never to speak of it again.

16:21.994 --> 16:23.851
Time for Plan B.

16:31.701 --> 16:32.841
Okay, Fluttershy.

16:32.842 --> 16:34.906
You grab Rainbow Dash
and hold her down.

16:34.907 --> 16:36.862
Applejack will lower me
down from this rope...

16:36.863 --> 16:38.706
...so I can cast
the memory spell on her.

16:38.707 --> 16:39.855
Got it!

16:45.225 --> 16:47.162
Um... I'm just wondering
if it's okay...

16:47.163 --> 16:49.552
...if I hold you down
against your will for a little bit?

16:51.808 --> 16:55.246
Nice try. Ponyville's
your problem, not mine.

16:58.561 --> 17:00.852
Come on, Fluttershy!
We've gotta catch her.

17:11.214 --> 17:12.228
Applejack!

17:21.223 --> 17:24.757
PinkiIEEE! You were supposed
to secure the roOOPE!

17:24.863 --> 17:25.858
Oops.

17:27.595 --> 17:31.167
Rarity! Pinkie! Hold on!
Y'all are slowin' 'er down!

17:31.168 --> 17:35.166
Oh, Fluttershy. Would you
be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?

17:36.114 --> 17:37.430
I can't!

17:37.431 --> 17:40.217
If you can't catch her, Discord wins!

17:41.126 --> 17:44.597
That... big... dumb... MEANIE!!!

17:47.944 --> 17:51.925
Okay, Applejack! Last rope!
Make it count!

18:05.058 --> 18:07.339
Lemme go! I don't need you guys!

18:07.340 --> 18:08.654
Leave me alone!

18:19.118 --> 18:21.264
Wha... What happened?

18:21.866 --> 18:23.802
How's Ponyville?!
Where are the Elements?!

18:24.235 --> 18:25.704
Did we stop Discord?

18:31.477 --> 18:33.873
Maybe it's a little early
for a group hug.

18:46.495 --> 18:50.898
Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing.

18:51.268 --> 18:52.842
Not as wonderful...

18:53.233 --> 18:54.863
...as friendship!

18:56.580 --> 18:57.904
This again?

19:02.700 --> 19:06.144
That's right! You couldn't break apart
our friendship for long.

19:06.588 --> 19:08.561
Oh, Applejack. Don't lie to me.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.471
I'm the one who made you a liar.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.459
Will you ever learn?

19:28.350 --> 19:30.656
I'll tell you what
we've learned, Discord.

19:30.657 --> 19:33.599
We've learned that
friendship isn't always easy...

19:33.600 --> 19:36.344
...but there's no doubt
it's worth fighting for.

19:36.345 --> 19:38.129
Ugh, gag.

19:38.130 --> 19:40.864
Fine. Go ahead.
Try and use your little Elements.

19:40.865 --> 19:43.202
"Friend me". Just make it quick.

19:44.376 --> 19:47.546
I'm missing some excellent chaos here.

19:47.825 --> 19:51.368
All right, ladies! Let's show him
what friendship can do!

19:51.369 --> 19:52.575
Wait, wait, wait!

20:12.598 --> 20:13.435
What's this?

20:16.246 --> 20:17.007
No...

20:23.457 --> 20:27.076
Nooo!!!

21:14.665 --> 21:16.587
We are gathered here today...

21:16.588 --> 21:20.939
...to once again honor
the heroism of these six friends...

21:20.940 --> 21:23.020
...who stood up
to the villain Discord...

21:23.021 --> 21:26.730
...and saved Equestria
from eternal chaos.
