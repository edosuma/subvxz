00:04.091 --> 00:05.831
- Previously
on "Good Girls"...

00:05.875 --> 00:08.008
- What's it say?

00:08.051 --> 00:09.835
- They said I took
their stupid pen.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.228
I don't know what you do,

00:11.272 --> 00:13.274
but it doesn't come
from painting nails.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.190
- This right here,
crime jar.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.148
- What is that?
- Happy anniversary.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.020
- No.
One of us has to be good!

00:20.063 --> 00:21.325
- Why?

00:21.369 --> 00:23.066
- Before we get started,
I wanted to introduce you

00:23.110 --> 00:25.634
to Lila.

00:25.677 --> 00:26.548
- I'll see you at home.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.289
- Pack up your desk.
- No.

00:28.332 --> 00:31.074
I'll tell them how you promote
using only your vagina.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.032
- So what are we gonna do here?

00:32.075 --> 00:33.685
- Gain back his trust.

00:33.729 --> 00:37.080
- Pay someone else
to blow his brains out?

00:37.124 --> 00:39.300
- A professional.
- Max has that cousin.

00:39.343 --> 00:41.345
- He's a former Navy SEAL.
He'll do it.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.086
- Third one this month
out of Detroit.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.087
Car paint?

00:44.131 --> 00:46.002
- Or nail polish.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.048
- Eww.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.571
- It's a woman.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.985
- Guess what
I did this weekend.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.552
- Not a spray tan.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.163
- I'm allergic
to the chemicals.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.078
- What's your hair's excuse?
- Mm.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.515
So I called Gary in Terrorism

02:47.558 --> 02:50.126
who knows Stephanie
in Foreign Affairs.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.258
You're not even listening.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.173
- Well,
my weekend was way better.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.566
- I had him recall
the nail polish.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.525
- Why?

02:57.568 --> 02:59.004
- Well, eventually,
they'll need more, right?

02:59.048 --> 03:00.702
And then we'll know.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.052
- Who signed off on that?
- Dave.

03:03.095 --> 03:05.054
- Wait, my Dave?

03:05.097 --> 03:06.273
- He just doesn't know it.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.622
- DL Dave?

03:07.665 --> 03:08.666
- Mm-hmm.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.798
- You know he and I were,
like--

03:09.841 --> 03:11.887
- Oh, I know.
- Like, all weekend.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.846
All over.
I mean, like, everywhere.

03:14.890 --> 03:18.415
- You think
he ran into you by accident?

03:19.895 --> 03:21.723
- God, I love you.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.507
- Needed him busy.

03:23.551 --> 03:25.335
By the way,
what's his wife like?

03:25.379 --> 03:27.032
Private sector.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.251
Perky boobs.

03:28.295 --> 03:31.385
- Mm.
What a waste.

03:33.735 --> 03:38.435
- Rite Aid, Walmart,
Walgreens, Amazon, eBay.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.568
I mean, there is a nail salon
in Bloomfield Hills

03:40.611 --> 03:42.787
selling them for $200 a bottle.

03:42.831 --> 03:45.050
- What?
Did you try Sephora?

03:45.094 --> 03:47.009
- Did you try Sephora?
- I tried everything.

03:47.052 --> 03:49.620
- Dude, how can one nail polish
color just suddenly be gone?

03:49.664 --> 03:52.232
- My manager says their
wholesaler's out everywhere.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.798
It's just weird.

03:53.842 --> 03:56.148
- Who would even want this
butt-ass ugly color besides us?

03:56.192 --> 03:58.673
- Exactly.
- You guys...

04:01.589 --> 04:04.244
We don't need it.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.594
- Well, it won't pass
without that glow.

04:06.637 --> 04:09.031
- Then we don't make anymore.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.295
- Uh, tell that to
your boy.

04:12.339 --> 04:15.820
- He won't be here.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.866
We have enough
to hire Max's cousin.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.739
And he's not "my boy."

04:23.263 --> 04:26.527
A'ight.
Let's dip.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.573
- We're rich!

04:29.617 --> 04:32.315
- Not ours.
- Whose is it?

04:32.359 --> 04:35.927
- Homeless, elderly,
underserved youth,

04:35.971 --> 04:37.929
whoever needs it the most,
we'll give it to them.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.322
- Why?

04:39.366 --> 04:42.282
- 'Cause that's what
good people do.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.806
- You guys,
go pee before school.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.126
So who does this go to?

05:01.170 --> 05:03.303
Tsunami survivors?

05:03.346 --> 05:05.653
- It's not right.

05:09.004 --> 05:10.440
- This is like "Below Deck."

05:10.484 --> 05:12.616
- It's just not you, okay?

05:12.660 --> 05:17.317
- They keep one guy
up on the bridge overnight

05:17.360 --> 05:20.145
to be a lookout.

05:20.189 --> 05:22.104
- Okay.

05:23.497 --> 05:26.543
- Why does it have to be me?

05:26.587 --> 05:27.892
- You're the cop.
- Maybe I'm asking you

05:27.936 --> 05:30.199
to take a shift.

05:30.242 --> 05:33.115
- My ship has sailed, Stanley.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.164
- Well, then I guess
nobody's gonna be watching

05:39.208 --> 05:40.296
when the iceberg hits.

05:54.136 --> 05:55.920
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.008
- What?

05:57.052 --> 05:58.488
- We should focus.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.925
- Well, that's exactly
how I studied in high school.

06:00.969 --> 06:04.102
- Well, if that worked,
then we wouldn't be here.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.843
On to geometry.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.019
Oh, sorry.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.065
It's Josh.
Dinner stuff.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.197
- You guys going out

06:12.241 --> 06:14.374
for a bit of
bangers and mash?

06:14.417 --> 06:16.419
Perhaps some fish and chips?

06:17.855 --> 06:20.467
- He's cooking.
- Mm.

06:20.510 --> 06:23.034
- well, reheating.
Okay.

06:23.078 --> 06:25.036
How are you with theorems?
- Super strong.

06:25.080 --> 06:28.692
Real good.
So, like, you know...

06:28.736 --> 06:31.521
What do you guys...
what are you guys into?

06:33.741 --> 06:35.177
- I don't know.
Lots of stuff.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.352
- Yeah?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.920
Yeah, like, uh, what?

06:38.963 --> 06:41.009
Books?

06:41.052 --> 06:42.314
- We have fun.

06:42.358 --> 06:44.360
- Mm.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.406
Like, uh...

06:46.449 --> 06:47.581
fun, fun?

06:47.624 --> 06:49.626
- Like crazy fun.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.411
- Well, that's the best kind.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.542
- Yeah, like, you know,

06:52.586 --> 06:54.501
I-really-shouldn't-even-say
kind of fun.

06:54.544 --> 06:57.460
- Dr. Cohen.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.680
- It'd be inappropriate.

07:00.811 --> 07:04.293
- But, of course,
I'm not your patient.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.473
They don't have sex.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.909
- How do you know?

07:11.953 --> 07:13.607
- He's a mouth-breather,
and she's a light-sleeper,

07:13.650 --> 07:15.260
so they keep separate places.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.610
- Okay. So?

07:16.653 --> 07:18.655
- For nine years.

07:18.699 --> 07:21.005
- Doesn't mean
they're not getting nasty.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.138
- They take Egyptology
together at Wayne State.

07:23.181 --> 07:25.401
- They're not getting nasty.

07:26.315 --> 07:29.274
- How are we even supposed to
know what this guy looks like?

07:29.318 --> 07:31.102
- He'll find us.

07:31.146 --> 07:33.104
- What'd you tell him?
Look for the blind person,

07:33.148 --> 07:34.758
or the D-bag?

07:35.542 --> 07:36.978
- Where is this guy?

07:41.286 --> 07:42.505
- Oh.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.554
- Hm.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.645
- Yeah...

08:06.268 --> 08:08.139
- Mrs. Boland.

08:08.183 --> 08:10.098
- Beth is fine.

08:11.012 --> 08:14.537
- Max got me up to speed
on what y'all are looking for.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.844
- Awesome.
- Cool, cool.

08:16.887 --> 08:21.501
- And do you feel like
it's something that you're...

08:21.544 --> 08:23.198
capable of?

08:23.851 --> 08:26.418
- If I'm being
totally honest here,

08:26.462 --> 08:28.508
I might not have
what it takes.

08:28.551 --> 08:31.032
- Really?

08:31.075 --> 08:32.947
- But you've done
this kind of job before?

08:32.990 --> 08:34.557
- I work mainly
with explosives.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.863
- Oh. That makes sense.

08:35.906 --> 08:39.040
- Car bombs, IEDs,
pyrotechnics,

08:39.083 --> 08:41.172
stuff that really,
you know...

08:42.434 --> 08:44.175
- Leaves a mark.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.699
- Bingo.

08:45.742 --> 08:46.961
From what Max said
about your target,

08:47.004 --> 08:50.791
he's not a guy who's so easy
to get close to.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.924
You're gonna need a sniper.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.754
- Well, where do we find
one of those?

08:57.798 --> 09:00.104
- I know a guy.
Already got him up to speed.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.585
- Hold on a minute.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.978
Max got you up to speed

09:04.021 --> 09:06.110
so you could get
another guy up to speed?

09:06.154 --> 09:07.721
- How many speeds
are we looking at here?

09:07.764 --> 09:09.287
- He's who you want.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.680
- Who is "he"?

09:10.724 --> 09:12.813
- I have no idea.

09:12.856 --> 09:13.901
He's that good.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.120
- Well, how do we find him?

09:16.164 --> 09:18.470
- He finds you.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.995
- Okay,
we've got a bit of a problem

09:21.038 --> 09:24.476
'cause we're in a time crunch.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.392
We provide a service
for the target--

09:27.436 --> 09:32.746
- That we are not
currently able to provide, so--

09:32.789 --> 09:37.315
- So we need to...

09:37.359 --> 09:43.017
neutralize our target
before we become his target.

09:43.060 --> 09:46.586
- You want it done right,
don't you?

09:46.629 --> 09:49.414
Thumbs up, or thumbs down?

09:49.458 --> 09:51.155
- Thumb...

09:51.199 --> 09:52.374
thumbs up?

09:52.417 --> 09:54.202
- Gonna need to see 'em.

10:07.650 --> 10:08.738
Now put them up your asses

10:08.782 --> 10:12.394
'cause this might take
a hot minute.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.190
- And so when the song
came out, I was like,

10:26.234 --> 10:27.104
"Hello, Mr. Smith,
I've been saying

10:27.148 --> 10:30.020
'get jiggy wit it' since '91."

10:30.064 --> 10:31.848
- And when did it
hit the clubs?

10:31.892 --> 10:33.676
- '95, earliest.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.765
- Guys, I have news.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.854
Just got heads up
from corporate.

10:37.898 --> 10:41.118
We're not supposed to know,
so act super surprised.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.686
But we just won
the Crystal Whale

10:43.730 --> 10:46.776
for the Southeastern
Michigan division.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.781
- Dope.

10:55.089 --> 10:58.440
- Great job, everyone.
Let's get back to work.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.451
- You got some nerve.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.018
- What's your problem now?

11:11.061 --> 11:14.064
- Every person on that floor
busts their ass for this place.

11:14.108 --> 11:16.980
They go to conferences,
they chase every lead,

11:17.024 --> 11:18.286
they work overtime,
they never see their kids,

11:18.329 --> 11:19.635
and for what?
To get dressed up

11:19.679 --> 11:20.854
and watch you
collect some award

11:20.897 --> 11:24.858
for co-signing their deals?

11:25.989 --> 11:28.209
- I told them
to put your name on it.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.645
- What?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.299
- You have a choice of walnut

11:31.342 --> 11:34.258
or mahogany base.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.785
Mahogany ages better.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.005
- Why me?

11:42.049 --> 11:44.094
- Your first month here,
you got higher sales

11:44.138 --> 11:46.009
than Eric had in eight years.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.405
- Thanks.
- You earned it.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.932
Oh, would you tell the team
that they're allowed

11:55.976 --> 11:59.719
to have fun at the show?
I'm not a total monster.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.809
- Why don't you
just tell them yourself?

12:02.852 --> 12:05.115
- I'm gonna skip this year.

12:05.159 --> 12:08.118
Use my ticket for your wife.

12:18.955 --> 12:22.219
- I like Circus Peanut.

12:22.263 --> 12:25.005
- It's too bright.
- Yeah, Island Mango's closer.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.616
- The hue's off.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.227
- Well, can't you just
do a combo thing?

12:35.493 --> 12:38.845
- I am not McDonald's.
I don't just do combos.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.977
It took months
to get this thing legit.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.284
Check your phone.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.634
- I just did.
- Did you check Facebook?

12:45.677 --> 12:47.375
- 'Cause a hitman's
gonna friend-request me?

12:47.418 --> 12:49.681
- Oh, like you're so versed
in how they communicate.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.293
- It doesn't
have to be perfect.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.990
It just has to be good enough
to buy us some time.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.600
- Yeah, come on, girl.
Beast mode.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.428
- You got this.

12:57.472 --> 13:00.997
- One part Peach En Fuego,
one part Tang Bang,

13:01.041 --> 13:05.349
a few drops of Prairie Fire...

13:05.393 --> 13:08.439
And a smidge
of Oh My Darlin' Clementine.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.354
- Fire up the press.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.365
Why don't we talk about--
- No.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.454
- You don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.023
- One question,
then we move on.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.156
- Great.
- Fine.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.245
- Now?
- Shoot.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.162
- Why her?

13:37.033 --> 13:39.166
- We're compatible.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.124
- The woman dehydrates fruit.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.213
- My favorite.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.868
- She loves Pilates.
- So do I.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.131
- No man loves that.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.177
- Well, that's how
relationships work, Annie,

13:50.220 --> 13:51.787
at least healthy ones.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.267
- Hot.

13:53.310 --> 13:57.227
- Say there's 100 things
about a person you could like.

13:57.271 --> 14:00.100
Connect to anything over 50,
and it will last.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.580
- Whew. Scorching hot.
- It's not a bad thing

14:02.624 --> 14:04.713
for partnerships
to make sense on paper.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.978
- I guess I just
don't really believe in lists.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.937
- Taking inventory
of a relationship

14:10.980 --> 14:14.070
helps you realize
what matters.

14:14.114 --> 14:18.466
- Ah.
Like Pilates and dried fruit.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.861
- Those are just two,
but yeah.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.211
- Gotcha, boss.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.563
- That's enough for today.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.261
- I still have
three minutes left.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.394
- I'll credit your account.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.006
- Look, all I'm saying
is that I'd rather not

14:37.050 --> 14:39.182
have to crunch numbers
to find my mate.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.663
- How's that gone for you?

14:47.974 --> 14:50.063
- That is enough for today.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.768
- Oh, by the way,
Mrs. Karpinski said

14:59.811 --> 15:02.510
she may have a futon for us.

15:02.553 --> 15:05.034
- We would be sitting
on a giant litterbox

15:05.078 --> 15:06.688
with all those cats.

15:08.429 --> 15:12.172
- Oh, and I won
the Crystal Whale.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.653
- Really?

15:15.697 --> 15:17.742
- You are looking
at the Southeastern Michigan

15:17.786 --> 15:20.267
regional hot tub king.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.530
- Spa.
- Spa.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.532
Spa king.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.231
Will you come?
- Of course.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.973
- Will you wear that dress?

15:31.017 --> 15:33.541
- What dress?

15:36.022 --> 15:38.589
- The one you wore for him.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.479
- What's that?

16:00.002 --> 16:01.525
- Money.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.485
- No.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.356
It's not.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.316
- Yeah, it is.
- Not money I could use.

16:13.102 --> 16:14.277
- Oh,
we had to change the formula.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.410
- Change it back.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.588
- It's not possible.

16:29.031 --> 16:32.034
- Yo, I been
thinking about this, um,

16:32.078 --> 16:36.212
relationship of ours.

16:36.256 --> 16:39.346
Lot of issues,
you and me.

16:41.957 --> 16:44.742
- I don't disagree.

16:44.786 --> 16:48.007
- Cut you in.
That didn't work.

16:48.050 --> 16:51.445
Gun to your head.
Nothing.

16:53.273 --> 16:57.059
I don't know how to
incentivize you anymore.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.496
So...

17:08.679 --> 17:10.464
Open it.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.911
- I don't get it.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.696
Take it out.

17:27.307 --> 17:28.438
- I don't want to.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.614
- We got another job
for you.

17:32.529 --> 17:35.967
- Well, whatever it is,
I don't want to do it.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.621
- Oh.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.845
Take it out, Elizabeth.

17:56.205 --> 17:59.034
Maybe you're right.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.167
I'm the problem.

18:03.343 --> 18:06.041
Well,
go ahead and finish me off.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.782
If you want to.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.501
- We're good.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.723
- Cool.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.906
That's what he used to take
of your friend, by the way.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.736
- Why?

18:50.651 --> 18:53.436
- Incentive.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.181
- Why did I touch it?

18:59.225 --> 19:02.097
- Why did you touch it?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.881
- What was I supposed to do?

19:03.925 --> 19:05.492
- Not touch it.

19:05.535 --> 19:08.103
- Some hood-ass man gives you
a questionable envelope?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.453
- Okay, for starters,
you guys weren't there,

19:10.497 --> 19:12.455
and the atmosphere
was very threatening.

19:12.499 --> 19:13.891
- You don't open it.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.720
- Okay, I'm, like,
so used to that man

19:16.764 --> 19:17.895
just handing me guns
that I, like,

19:17.939 --> 19:19.375
I don't even think about it.

19:19.419 --> 19:20.768
- God, he's good.

19:20.811 --> 19:23.031
- I need you to stop that.
It's making me crazy.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.470
- It's how I think now.

19:33.302 --> 19:36.262
-He's not getting a good batch
without my Creamsicle Sunset.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.482
- What about that place
that we went?

19:39.526 --> 19:41.397
- The markup is insane.

19:41.441 --> 19:44.139
- I wasn't talking
about buying it.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.968
- Well,
they're gonna know it's us.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.491
- How?
- Because that woman

19:48.535 --> 19:50.493
saw our faces, Annie.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.509
She didn't see mine.

20:07.858 --> 20:10.034
I'll do it.

20:11.688 --> 20:14.213
You touched it.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.961
- God doesn't need your stuff.

20:24.005 --> 20:27.922
What good is stuff
to the King of kings?

20:27.965 --> 20:32.013
What he wants is our hearts
and our souls

20:32.056 --> 20:35.930
and our creativity
to think outside ourselves

20:35.973 --> 20:38.019
through service.

20:38.062 --> 20:41.544
Ruby Hill, come up here
and give your testimony.

20:49.944 --> 20:53.121
Sister Hill saw a need
in our community,

20:53.164 --> 20:55.123
and she filled it.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.126
- Tomorrow, I'm taking women
from the Brush Street Mission

20:58.169 --> 20:59.649
to a nail salon.

20:59.693 --> 21:02.348
It's not a big deal.
I just thought that these

21:02.391 --> 21:06.700
underserved women should
feel good about themselves.

21:06.743 --> 21:09.006
- And she's humble, too.
Amen.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.704
all: Amen.

21:20.757 --> 21:23.369
- I can't decide.
Fingers or toes?

21:23.412 --> 21:25.066
- Do both.

21:47.697 --> 21:50.700
- Oh, come on.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.876
Sarah, open the door.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.053
You want to sort of
tilt it back,

21:56.097 --> 21:57.316
more towards your butt.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.796
- It won't go in.
- I promise it will.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.711
Just shove it on up there.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.409
- How?

22:04.323 --> 22:07.238
- She just got her first,
you know, code red.

22:07.282 --> 22:10.764
Look at the picture
on the damn instructions.

22:10.807 --> 22:12.548
45-degree angle, baby girl.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.289
- Oh,
'cause I have a protractor.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.160
- Let me in.
I will help you.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.119
- Go away.

22:19.512 --> 22:20.948
- Is there a key
to get in here?

22:20.991 --> 22:24.168
- Oh, my God.
Of course.

22:24.212 --> 22:27.041
- Bet a man made
those instructions, right?

22:36.659 --> 22:39.401
Well, now you know how to put
one in when the time comes.

22:39.445 --> 22:42.143
- What'd you steal in there?

22:42.186 --> 22:43.753
- Don't worry about it.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.322
- I was an accomplice.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.846
- We're even now.
Your debt is paid.

22:49.890 --> 22:52.196
- You're the biggest hypocrite.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.982
- I'm your mother.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.549
- So it's okay
for you to just do

22:56.592 --> 22:59.160
whatever you want
whenever you want?

22:59.203 --> 23:02.424
- Oh.
You think I get off on this?

23:02.468 --> 23:05.645
- What an example you are,
Sister Ruby.

23:05.688 --> 23:08.996
- Don't look at me with your
little smug, judgy face,

23:09.039 --> 23:13.609
like you're grown when you know
nothing about nothing.

23:13.653 --> 23:15.437
- I have homework.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.658
- What, you thought kidneys
grow on trees?

23:18.701 --> 23:21.878
I made a choice, okay?

23:21.922 --> 23:25.273
To do something
I thought I would never do.

23:25.316 --> 23:28.537
And it wasn't for fun
or to have nice things.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.715
- What do you mean?

23:34.413 --> 23:37.981
- I bought you a second chance.

23:38.025 --> 23:40.767
I'm sorry, I stole it.

23:40.810 --> 23:43.900
Something that insurance,
prayers, neighbors,

23:43.944 --> 23:46.120
none of that could do.

23:46.163 --> 23:49.384
And I will be damned
if I threw my soul away

23:49.428 --> 23:51.821
so you could
turn out like this.

23:55.608 --> 23:59.220
- Why didn't
you just tell me that?

23:59.263 --> 24:01.265
- I didn't think
I'd ever have to.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.453
- What's all this?

24:14.496 --> 24:17.499
- I had to take more than just
the polish to pin it on,

24:17.543 --> 24:20.415
you know,
the underserved.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.896
- At least they got
free mani-pedis out of it.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.162
- You did good.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.050
- Hey.
- What did he forget?

24:49.226 --> 24:50.271
- Homework.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.229
- He had his backpack.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.797
- Hm.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.463
- This is--
we have paper at home.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.030
- Oh.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.075
- Oh?
- Yeah, the, um...

25:19.256 --> 25:21.302
- Seriously?
- I had to ask you something.

25:23.434 --> 25:25.349
- There it is.
- I knew you would never come.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.090
- Yeah, well, you were right.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.919
All right, what, what?

25:31.704 --> 25:33.880
- Okay.

25:36.230 --> 25:39.581
What was on your list?

25:39.625 --> 25:42.105
- Huh?

25:42.149 --> 25:46.283
- Like, when you first met me,
what did you like?

25:48.024 --> 25:50.070
- Your boobs.
- Right.

25:50.113 --> 25:51.593
But what else?

25:51.637 --> 25:52.768
- Well, I mean, the fact

25:52.812 --> 25:54.944
that you showed me one
during detention.

25:54.988 --> 26:00.036
- Okay, I think I mean more
like, you know, like...

26:00.080 --> 26:02.996
like why'd you choose me?

26:07.914 --> 26:09.002
- I gotta go home.
- Hey, you know,

26:09.045 --> 26:09.959
you're the one
who wanted me to go

26:10.003 --> 26:13.397
to therapy in the first place.

26:13.441 --> 26:14.921
- Fine.

26:14.964 --> 26:18.272
Um...

26:18.315 --> 26:21.449
you were really...

26:21.492 --> 26:23.016
you're a really good mom.

26:23.059 --> 26:25.496
- Eww.
- Eww? That's a nice--

26:25.540 --> 26:28.412
- It--
- All right.

26:35.376 --> 26:36.943
All right.

26:36.986 --> 26:40.163
Say, like, we were
at a party or something,

26:40.207 --> 26:41.948
and someone
was doing something stupid,

26:41.991 --> 26:44.646
like laughing too loud,

26:44.690 --> 26:46.300
or some woman
comes out of the bathroom

26:46.343 --> 26:49.346
with her skirt
tucked into her underwear...

26:51.827 --> 26:54.656
Even if I wasn't
right next to you, I just...

26:57.703 --> 26:59.008
I knew that I'd look
across the room

26:59.052 --> 27:02.708
and you'd be cracking up
'cause you'd seen it, too.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.716
So does that count?

27:12.282 --> 27:14.284
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
What are you doing?

27:14.328 --> 27:15.851
- Therapy.
- No, you're just hammered.

27:15.895 --> 27:18.767
- So?
- So I have to go home.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.421
- Just stay for one drink.

27:20.464 --> 27:21.814
- It's never just one with us.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.206
- Well,
I have a brand-new bottle.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.817
- Yeah,
that's part of the problem.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.166
- We don't even
have to have sex.

27:26.209 --> 27:29.865
We could just, you know,
get naked and hang out.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.695
- No, no.

27:33.739 --> 27:34.957
- Sorry.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.833
- Dakota's having trouble
sleeping at night.

27:40.876 --> 27:42.617
I do the night feeding, so...

27:42.661 --> 27:45.054
- I got it.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.710
- Okay.

28:10.471 --> 28:11.907
- Hey, you got a shaker?

28:11.951 --> 28:13.474
- I don't have any furniture,
man.

28:13.517 --> 28:14.997
Beth, we gotta go.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.216
- What about olive picks?

28:16.259 --> 28:19.567
- There's no time.
Limo's almost here.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.351
- They're roadies.

28:21.395 --> 28:24.572
- Phil went to the Radisson
instead of the Sheraton.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.838
- Oh, snap.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.885
Yeah, you like it?

28:32.928 --> 28:35.365
- You must be a beaver,
'cause damn.

28:35.409 --> 28:36.323
- Dude, chill.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.934
Can you zip me up?

28:38.978 --> 28:41.023
- With pleasure.

28:41.067 --> 28:43.069
You look incredible.

28:43.112 --> 28:44.505
- Not so bad yourself.

28:44.548 --> 28:47.073
- Thank you.
Hey, will you record my speech?

28:47.116 --> 28:49.771
- Yeah, let me see
how much battery I have.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.425
- I'm gonna tell
the kids to go to bed

28:51.468 --> 28:53.819
like they do in the Oscars.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.259
What?

29:01.217 --> 29:03.002
Oh, no.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.917
- I'm so sorry.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.919
- Martini or prosecco?
Shout it out.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.790
- Are you serious right now?

29:08.834 --> 29:10.139
I know how important
this is.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.880
- It's the Crystal Whale.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.623
- You're not coming?
- It's 'cause of him?

29:15.666 --> 29:17.973
- No. No.

29:19.409 --> 29:21.977
- You know what?
Don't sweat it.

29:22.021 --> 29:24.240
It's fine.
Hey, let's roll.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.634
Limo's here.

29:26.677 --> 29:28.331
No big deal.

29:28.375 --> 29:29.942
- Dean.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.900
- It's not a real thing
anyway.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.513
Hey.

29:39.429 --> 29:42.128
- I needed to meet
face to face.

29:42.171 --> 29:43.607
In my line of work,

29:43.651 --> 29:46.523
you have to be careful
who you get in bed with.

29:49.135 --> 29:52.965
- So our mutual friend
got you up to speed with--

29:53.008 --> 29:55.837
- I am so sorry.

29:57.883 --> 30:01.016
I can't talk shop
on an empty stomach.

30:01.060 --> 30:04.715
Do they serve breakfast
all day here?

30:04.759 --> 30:06.848
- Great eggs B.

30:09.285 --> 30:10.199
- Done.

30:19.513 --> 30:20.383
- Was it not good?

30:20.427 --> 30:22.646
- Exquisite.

30:22.690 --> 30:26.520
Dolly Parton famously takes
one bite of each food group.

30:26.563 --> 30:29.001
It's how
she's kept her figure.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.350
- Oh?

30:30.393 --> 30:34.136
- All right.
Shall we look at our calendars?

30:34.180 --> 30:36.051
- Can...

30:38.445 --> 30:42.405
I'm kind of new to this.

30:42.449 --> 30:45.147
- I don't get a lot
of repeat customers.

30:47.062 --> 30:49.369
Um...

30:49.412 --> 30:50.892
how does this work?

30:56.071 --> 30:57.464
- Say I'm your lawyer.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.814
I usually do
a fair amount of prep work

30:59.858 --> 31:03.339
before we would go to trial.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.689
So I charge by the hour.

31:05.733 --> 31:08.867
Research and discovery
is billed at 700.

31:08.910 --> 31:12.653
The defendant,
is he local?

31:12.696 --> 31:16.613
Okay,
so travel is not an issue.

31:16.657 --> 31:19.965
All other expenses
are on top of the retainer.

31:20.008 --> 31:23.533
Trial itself
will run you 60 grand.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.448
- We were told 30.

31:25.492 --> 31:30.366
- By a man with no arms,
who you're free to hire.

31:30.410 --> 31:33.413
- I only brought 30.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.502
- You'll receive invoices
as we go.

31:35.545 --> 31:39.854
So how is...

31:39.898 --> 31:43.640
Tuesday at 3:45?

31:43.684 --> 31:47.035
Is that too soon?

31:47.079 --> 31:48.863
- No, sooner's better.
- Oh, no, scrap that.

31:48.907 --> 31:52.649
I'll be in Ohio.
Any chance he's in Ohio?

31:52.693 --> 31:56.262
All right,
the next available slot

31:56.305 --> 31:59.526
that I have is...

32:01.832 --> 32:04.009
Oh.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.185
Friday.
Morning.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.930
- That works.

32:14.236 --> 32:15.759
- Done.

32:22.723 --> 32:25.813
Thank you, Mrs. Boland.

32:59.194 --> 33:01.153
- Hey.

33:04.156 --> 33:05.766
- How'd it go?

33:05.809 --> 33:07.637
- Oh, it was...

33:07.681 --> 33:10.292
it was pretty great.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.425
You okay?

33:12.468 --> 33:15.080
- Yeah, I'm fine.

33:15.123 --> 33:16.995
- What are doing here?

33:18.735 --> 33:21.129
- Following up on some emails.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.088
- Why don't you go home?

33:25.046 --> 33:29.790
- I really don't have much
to go home to, Dean.

33:29.833 --> 33:33.228
My husband has three TVs
in his office.

33:33.272 --> 33:38.059
Each one has a different
sporting event on at all times.

33:38.103 --> 33:41.149
My daughter practically lives
with her friend.

33:41.193 --> 33:43.369
And...

33:43.412 --> 33:45.849
my Labradoodle only eats

33:45.893 --> 33:49.114
if my husband
fills the bowl, so...

33:49.157 --> 33:52.726
- Oh.

33:52.769 --> 33:55.120
I thought I'd put
this on your shelf.

33:55.163 --> 33:58.210
- Oh,
you don't have to do that.

34:03.171 --> 34:06.435
- Oh, it looks good.

34:06.479 --> 34:09.047
- You went with the walnut,
huh?

34:14.400 --> 34:16.837
- I don't...

34:16.880 --> 34:20.101
I don't think you're...

34:20.145 --> 34:23.061
you know, a monster.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.356
- What now?

35:00.881 --> 35:02.187
- I have a surprise
for you.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.580
- I'm scared.
- I did my homework.

35:04.624 --> 35:06.974
- That is a surprise.

35:07.017 --> 35:08.976
- Yeah, well, Greg came over.

35:09.019 --> 35:10.151
- Oh, okay.

35:10.195 --> 35:11.935
- And we started
making that list.

35:11.979 --> 35:15.069
- Oh. How'd it go?
- It was revelatory.

35:15.113 --> 35:18.681
- All ears.
- You see,

35:18.725 --> 35:22.076
every time that we had
something in common,

35:22.120 --> 35:25.210
I just wanted to rip
his pants off, you know?

35:25.253 --> 35:27.429
Like, for example,
we both like making sandwiches

35:27.473 --> 35:29.953
out of Pop Tarts,
but that didn't even make it

35:29.997 --> 35:32.217
on the list because
we started kissing.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.784
And not just
like a little peck.

35:34.828 --> 35:39.485
Like, full on,
with tongue, making out.

35:39.528 --> 35:40.790
That kind of thing.
- Mm-hmm.

35:40.834 --> 35:43.793
- Oh, and we both like naps.

35:43.837 --> 35:47.145
- Well, who doesn't?
- Mm-hmm.

35:47.188 --> 35:49.016
- But see, of course,
that doesn't make it

35:49.059 --> 35:50.800
on the list, either,
because by now,

35:50.844 --> 35:53.890
we're in each other's pants.

35:53.934 --> 35:55.196
And, you know,
when I say pants,

35:55.240 --> 35:59.548
I mean, like, we're deep
inside the underwear.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.724
And, uh, you know,
we're both

36:01.768 --> 36:03.770
just so crazy turned on

36:03.813 --> 36:05.424
that we don't even make it
to the bedroom.

36:05.467 --> 36:08.209
So we're on the couch,
and he kind of, like,

36:08.253 --> 36:10.168
kind of flips me up
on top of him,

36:10.211 --> 36:12.561
you know, in kind of a Cirque
du Soleil type--

36:12.605 --> 36:14.911
- Okay, I get it, Annie.

36:14.955 --> 36:18.001
- You know how it is
when you're just so...

36:18.045 --> 36:20.700
you're so in sync with someone
that it kind of feels like

36:20.743 --> 36:23.964
an old song
you know all the words to?

36:24.007 --> 36:27.533
And every instrument,
every note,

36:27.576 --> 36:30.536
every beat, the rhythm,

36:30.579 --> 36:35.845
and the tempo, you know,
it just take you over until--

36:35.889 --> 36:37.325
- Okay, yeah.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.675
- And all of a sudden,
you're not even human anymore.

36:39.719 --> 36:42.461
You're just an animal.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.854
Just made out of nerve endings

36:44.898 --> 36:50.120
and feelings
in that hot, aching need--

36:50.164 --> 36:53.254
- All right.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.651
- So I guess
what I learned is that

36:58.694 --> 37:00.522
there could be 99 things
on that list,

37:00.566 --> 37:04.918
but, to me,
only one matters.

37:04.961 --> 37:08.226
- And what's that?

37:08.269 --> 37:09.879
- Spark.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.755
But I'm...

37:15.798 --> 37:18.148
but I'm sure
you must have that, right?

37:22.936 --> 37:26.722
- Thank you for your honesty.

37:26.766 --> 37:30.422
- Thank you for your advice.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.909
- Nail salon robbed, right?
Super ritzy suburb.

37:39.953 --> 37:41.389
Guess what they took.

37:41.433 --> 37:42.912
- Not that coat.

37:42.956 --> 37:45.306
- How's DL Dave's mood?

37:45.350 --> 37:46.873
- Not good.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.266
- Think he'll give me
the go-ahead?

37:48.309 --> 37:50.920
- He's still pissed
about the recall.

37:50.964 --> 37:53.271
- It's like Bin Laden, right?

37:53.314 --> 37:56.404
- If nail polish was a weapon
of mass destruction, sure.

37:56.448 --> 37:57.927
- No one believed the analysts
when they said

37:57.971 --> 37:59.494
follow the courier.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.583
The CIA didn't listen
to them for years.

38:01.627 --> 38:04.847
Thought they were useless.
Basement trash.

38:04.891 --> 38:06.284
You know, 'cause they worked
in the basement.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.807
But they sift
through the evidence,

38:07.850 --> 38:09.287
they track every lead,

38:09.330 --> 38:12.028
and they end up being the ones
who cracked the case.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.465
They found him.

38:13.508 --> 38:17.904
Not the Pakistani ops.
Not the fancy drones.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.775
The basement trash.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.342
- That's definitely trash.

38:21.386 --> 38:25.259
- Hey, it's new.
- It's a parade float.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.305
- I'm going in.
- Okay, take that off.

38:27.348 --> 38:30.351
It's offensive.
Tell him I ran the analytics.

38:30.395 --> 38:31.874
- Did you?

38:31.918 --> 38:33.833
- I will by the time
he's done yelling at you.

38:33.876 --> 38:36.270
Don't cry.
Save it for the bathroom.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.141
And don't compare this
to Bin Laden.

38:38.185 --> 38:40.492
- You know this bitch
is hiding in a cave somewhere.

38:40.535 --> 38:41.667
- Do not.

38:41.710 --> 38:44.017
- Just gotta root her out.

38:52.678 --> 38:54.506
- Here's a question.

38:54.549 --> 38:59.467
Are there actual truffles
in truffle oil?

38:59.511 --> 39:02.992
Because one shaving of truffles
is like a gazillion dollars.

39:03.036 --> 39:06.561
And, like,
a bottle's 10 bucks.

39:06.605 --> 39:08.911
- I quit my job today.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.348
- Why?

39:17.529 --> 39:20.488
Um...

39:20.532 --> 39:22.360
I kissed my boss.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.568
- Why?

39:58.700 --> 40:00.223
- She kissed me.

40:02.008 --> 40:03.444
- Okay.

40:03.488 --> 40:07.796
- So I kissed her back.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.581
- And then what?

40:13.019 --> 40:17.327
- She tried to undo my pants,
and I stopped her.

40:17.371 --> 40:18.851
- Why?

40:18.894 --> 40:21.288
- 'Cause the tux have that
weird double button, and so I--

40:21.331 --> 40:23.290
- Why did you stop her?

40:27.207 --> 40:31.298
- Because I don't want her.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.565
I want you.

40:37.609 --> 40:40.350
But I don't really
have the best track record,

40:40.394 --> 40:43.571
so I don't expect you
to believe me.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.488
And if you need me
to go to my mom's,

40:47.532 --> 40:51.579
just you say the word.

40:51.623 --> 40:56.323
But I really...

40:56.366 --> 40:59.457
Beth, I really want to stay.

41:14.950 --> 41:18.737
- Dean.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.390
- Yeah.

41:25.874 --> 41:27.789
- Don't go.

41:34.143 --> 41:35.188
- Better not be my baby girl

41:35.231 --> 41:36.755
roaming these halls
at midnight.

41:36.798 --> 41:40.846
- Better be sleepwalking.

41:40.889 --> 41:44.545
- I figured out
who we should help.
