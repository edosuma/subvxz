01:10.143 --> 01:13.144
Hello? Testing, 1-2-3. Hello?

01:14.145 --> 01:17.144
Yeess! Well, here we go.

01:18.006 --> 01:20.518
Ship's log... erm... one.

01:20.619 --> 01:24.921
I've decided to keep a journal of life
on board ship, and send it off in a probe.

01:25.751 --> 01:28.951
Since turning 28 I feel a
new maturity about myself,

01:29.052 --> 01:30.642
in fact I can't even
remember the last time

01:30.643 --> 01:32.557
I tried to urinate on Rimmer
from the top of D-deck.

01:33.558 --> 01:34.852
No, wait a minute... Friday.

01:34.853 --> 01:37.211
But apart from that *one
lapse*, maturity-wise

01:37.212 --> 01:39.869
I'm practically up there
with Abe Lincoln and Moses.

01:39.870 --> 01:42.328
Now, just recently we
came across a craft,

01:42.329 --> 01:45.300
piloted by ourselves from
15 years into the future.

01:45.601 --> 01:49.015
We had a bit of an argument, and
they attacked us. See attached:

01:50.043 --> 01:51.006
Another lock!

01:51.041 --> 01:51.741
Incoming message...

01:52.041 --> 01:55.132
Either you give us access
to the data we require,

01:55.133 --> 01:58.038
or be prepared to be
blasted out of the sky...

02:03.042 --> 02:03.842
Cat!

02:06.039 --> 02:08.042
.Dead... but there may be a -

02:11.037 --> 02:14.002
Kryten... Kryten!

02:14.037 --> 02:16.249
There may be a *what*?
A way out of this?

02:16.250 --> 02:18.040
Is *that* what you were gonna say?

02:18.041 --> 02:21.041
Speak, Kryten! How can
we change what's happening!?

02:51.034 --> 02:55.471
We were no match; they killed us, and
destroyed everything on board ship,

02:55.472 --> 02:58.131
including the Time Drive,
which meant there was

02:58.132 --> 02:59.600
no Time Drive for them
to have in the future,

02:59.601 --> 03:03.336
to bring back into the past, destroy the
future of their past selves in the present.

03:03.437 --> 03:07.166
Put simply: by killing us they killed
themselves, because once we were dead

03:07.167 --> 03:08.948
it was impossible for us to
become them in the future,

03:08.949 --> 03:12.047
and return in time to kill ourselves in
the past, even though it was the present.

03:16.031 --> 03:17.003
Oh smeg!

03:17.038 --> 03:20.034
Have you been trying to explain
about our future selves *again*, sir?

03:20.069 --> 03:20.999
I just thought I'd give it one more go -

03:21.034 --> 03:24.032
D'oh! That's the third camera this week!
The machines just can't take it, sir.

03:26.045 --> 03:29.285
But I'm only trying to explain why Starbug's
damaged, despite the timeline being erased;

03:29.286 --> 03:32.089
'cos this reality's unstable, and
anomalies have merged from both dimensions

03:32.090 --> 03:33.735
to cope with the paradox.

03:33.970 --> 03:36.335
Oh! Garbled, confusing,
and quite frankly duller

03:36.336 --> 03:38.942
than an in-flight magazine
produced by 'Air Belgium'!

03:38.943 --> 03:42.030
Now just state our position and
explain we're down on supplies.

03:43.035 --> 03:44.830
All right! All right!

03:46.101 --> 03:49.101
Wiped out..? Kryten, man, they *can't* be...

03:50.101 --> 03:52.810
I'm afraid so, sir. The laser
cannon breached the main watertank

03:52.811 --> 03:55.102
and flooded supply deck B.
They didn't stand a chance.

03:55.998 --> 03:56.768
Yeah, but surely...

03:56.803 --> 03:58.905
There was nothing we
could do to save them, sir.

04:00.106 --> 04:03.111
So, now we've got no poppadoms at all?

04:05.101 --> 04:09.102
No poppadoms, no curries, all the
Indian food supplies have been totaled.

04:13.102 --> 04:15.104
I'll have to survive without
them then... I'll have salads.

04:17.101 --> 04:19.100
Sir! You're in shock, you
don't know what you're saying.

04:20.096 --> 04:21.096
After all it's only curry.

04:22.100 --> 04:25.578
'Only curry'? The enormity of it
hasn't sunk in, you must mourn, sir.

04:25.579 --> 04:27.096
Don't you see? You must mourn.

04:27.131 --> 04:28.066
Curries...

04:28.101 --> 04:32.096
Ohhhh sirr, get it out! Cry like a baby!

04:32.869 --> 04:36.307
What am I gonna do? Curry night
was the one little beacon I had...

04:36.808 --> 04:41.894
made me feel like a normal ordinary guy,
not some sad freak stuck in deep space;

04:42.195 --> 04:44.858
no woman, no hope, no curry.

04:44.893 --> 04:48.574
Worse still, a choice of
only two alcoholic beverages:

04:48.575 --> 04:51.854
Cinzano Bianco, or advocat.
Its a human tragedy!

04:59.138 --> 05:04.133
You know the news? All the curry
supplies have been destroyed.

05:05.137 --> 05:06.133
We heard.

05:08.132 --> 05:10.560
As a mark of respect, we
thought on Sunday at 12 o'clock

05:10.561 --> 05:12.136
we could have a minute's flatulence.

05:14.131 --> 05:17.101
It's nothing to you guys,
is it? It's changing my life!

05:17.136 --> 05:21.866
Sirs, the altercation with our future
selves caused dimensional anomalies

05:21.867 --> 05:24.679
which have expanded
the cargo deck by 212%!

05:24.980 --> 05:28.131
We should ascertain that
the new structure is stable.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.174
My heavens - I'm head head!

06:19.177 --> 06:21.174
Shh! It's only temporary.

06:22.179 --> 06:22.979
I don't understand.

06:23.176 --> 06:24.813
Look, I want to go back
in time on a curry hunt.

06:24.814 --> 06:26.182
Kryten said "no way"; what do *you* say?

06:27.177 --> 06:29.742
I can't go behind Kryten's head;
what would he say if he found out?

06:29.743 --> 06:31.175
It's deceitful, wrong, and dishonest.

06:34.378 --> 06:37.058
I'm in! Those are emotions
I have longed to experience,

06:37.459 --> 06:40.178
but first, you'll have to override my guilt
chip and disable my behaviour protocols.

06:41.178 --> 06:42.138
Okay, show me how.

06:42.173 --> 06:44.176
Press the 'skull release'
catch behind my right ear.

06:56.172 --> 06:57.172
Okay, here we go...

07:03.175 --> 07:09.176
My guilt chip. No behaviour
protocols... just call me "bad ass"!

07:16.214 --> 07:18.218
Healthy? Who cares? Pork away!

07:33.216 --> 07:36.475
So, um, Kryten, now that
you've had time to think,

07:36.776 --> 07:38.715
what about that curry
hunt to the 22nd century?

07:38.750 --> 07:41.955
Ooh, I meant to mention that,
yes. I over-reacted yesterday;

07:41.956 --> 07:44.215
on reflection, I think
it'd be quite safe.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.176
Safe?

07:45.211 --> 07:46.212
What about causality?

07:47.216 --> 07:50.290
Causality? Well, okay, you know,
one event causes another, okay,

07:50.291 --> 07:51.899
but sometimes, you just gotta say:

07:51.900 --> 07:54.216
"The laws of time and
space? Who gives a smeg!"

07:55.258 --> 07:57.276
Okay, I think what
Kryten's trying to say is -

07:58.276 --> 07:59.240
You're smoking!

07:59.275 --> 08:01.280
Oh, is my generator overheating again?

08:01.315 --> 08:02.295
A cigarette!

08:02.330 --> 08:03.240
Do you want one?

08:03.275 --> 08:04.277
Of course I don't want one!

08:04.312 --> 08:05.245
Do you want me to go outside?

08:05.280 --> 08:08.927
I think what Kryten's trying to say
is that it's okay to go back in time,

08:08.928 --> 08:12.279
and order a small lake's worth of
vindaloo to go. Isn't that right?

08:12.314 --> 08:13.274
You bet your ass!

08:14.280 --> 08:16.944
Okay, so lets navigate those
unreality bubbles and do it!

08:16.945 --> 08:18.276
Kryten, can I have a word...

08:22.274 --> 08:27.909
What is *wrong* with you? You don't
smoke, you never say "bet your ass",

08:28.010 --> 08:30.680
and you never use your groinal
attachment to stir anybody's tea!

08:31.273 --> 08:32.243
I didn't get any error commands!

08:32.278 --> 08:35.322
Because you've got no behaviour
protocols, you spanner!

08:35.722 --> 08:37.279
Now get a grip or we'll be rumbled.

08:42.575 --> 08:43.573
So uptight!

09:04.568 --> 09:07.073
What is wrong with that
demented Tonka toy now?

09:07.573 --> 09:10.583
He's got a bit of a bio-glitch
in his transponder calibrations.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.570
It's only temporary.

09:12.570 --> 09:14.567
Heyyy, Mr. Timedrive.

09:15.571 --> 09:19.104
Okay Kryten, we want the
Taj Mahal Tandoori Restaurant

09:19.105 --> 09:21.153
behind the JMC building in London.

09:21.754 --> 09:23.074
Back table; quiet.

09:23.569 --> 09:25.571
I'll need a moment to acquaint
myself with the controls -

09:25.906 --> 09:26.972
But you've used it before?

09:27.574 --> 09:28.274
Have I?

09:28.572 --> 09:31.522
Oh, yes, of course I have.
Sorry. How stupid of me.

09:31.523 --> 09:33.564
Just programming it now, matey boy.

10:14.565 --> 10:17.566
Nice landing, Kryten, that was about
as smooth as an Egyptian whiskey.

10:18.561 --> 10:21.567
Apologies, sir, I'm, ah,
I'm not sure what I did then.

10:21.602 --> 10:23.531
This isn't right, where are we?

10:23.566 --> 10:28.367
Well, according to the Time Drive,
the date is November the 22nd, 1963,

10:28.368 --> 10:30.568
and we're in the city of Dallas.

10:31.561 --> 10:33.565
How come? Gimme that thing!

10:35.561 --> 10:39.561
I've always been a bit of a technical whiz
when it comes to these kinds of gizmos...

10:42.566 --> 10:45.564
Hmm, Dallas, '63- no doubt about it.

10:48.566 --> 10:51.560
Dallas? Wasn't that that place where
that American king got assassinated?

10:53.565 --> 10:54.265
JFK.

10:54.558 --> 10:55.560
No, it was John something,
not 'Jeff Kay'...

10:57.564 --> 11:00.786
J - F - K, not 'Jeff Kay',
you gimboid; like the airport.

11:00.787 --> 11:02.564
I did a paper on him at school.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.561
I wonder why anyone would want to
name their kid after an airport?

11:06.559 --> 11:09.559
The airport was named *after* the president.

11:09.594 --> 11:10.559
All right!

11:27.558 --> 11:30.558
Where did this gunman
dude shoot from anyway?

11:31.557 --> 11:33.713
Well, if my histo-chip
serves me correctly,

11:33.714 --> 11:36.556
the gunman's location was in
the 'Texas Book Depository'.

12:03.562 --> 12:04.555
It was probably from this very window!

12:05.560 --> 12:06.660
What, do you reckon?

12:13.558 --> 12:14.818
Hey, what's this?

12:22.500 --> 12:25.352
Hey, there's something on
the end of this, giz a hand!

12:25.559 --> 12:28.557
Pull, everyone, or I'm in trouble!

12:38.556 --> 12:40.514
Hey, what's going on down there?

12:40.515 --> 12:44.552
What're all those people doing
gathered around that giant pizza?

12:45.551 --> 12:47.552
That is *not* a giant pizza, sir.

12:48.555 --> 12:51.717
It's 8 foot across, man
- don't you think that's giant?

12:51.718 --> 12:55.557
What kind of pizza house have you
been going to? 'The FatBastoria'?

12:57.555 --> 12:58.555
Hey, look at this!

13:00.558 --> 13:02.551
I think we just pulled the
gunman out of the window!

13:03.549 --> 13:04.550
FBI! Drop the gun!

13:06.557 --> 13:07.558
Don't shoot!

13:07.593 --> 13:08.524
Hands on heads!

13:08.559 --> 13:11.125
You are hereby charged with
the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald,

13:11.126 --> 13:14.112
who valiantly tried to foil your
attempt to assassinate the president.

13:14.113 --> 13:16.551
Thanks to Mr. Oswald, the
president is alive but wounded.

13:16.586 --> 13:19.551
What is that? Some kind of
weapon? Kick it over here!

13:31.436 --> 13:33.444
Ohhhh! Nice one, Kryts.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.400
Where are we?

13:34.435 --> 13:37.935
It says 1966, I must have
prodded us forward three years.

13:37.970 --> 13:41.436
At least it'll give us time
to analyse the original error.

13:44.433 --> 13:49.432
Hey, there's nobody here,
the entire city's deserted...

13:57.433 --> 13:59.429
I don't understand it, all
we did is save Kennedy's life.

14:00.430 --> 14:02.434
Is that bad? What kind of a dude was he?

14:03.433 --> 14:04.432
He was a fine man.

14:04.467 --> 14:06.430
Look!

14:09.436 --> 14:10.429
Can you get anything for us from his scent?

14:14.427 --> 14:15.127
Male.

14:17.772 --> 14:18.811
Mid-thirties.

14:19.805 --> 14:22.810
It looks like he was trampled to
death in some kind of stampede.

14:26.807 --> 14:27.806
Just processing.

14:28.811 --> 14:30.805
I'll re-route the results
through my chest monitor:

14:33.464 --> 14:36.080
President Kennedy was impeached in 1964

14:36.081 --> 14:40.069
for sharing a mistress with
Mafia boss, Sam Giancana.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.017
It was the biggest scandal
in American history,

14:43.018 --> 14:45.520
Kennedy was sentenced to three years

14:45.521 --> 14:49.985
in an open prison in July, '65.
J. Edgar Hoover became president;

14:49.986 --> 14:55.464
he was forced to run by the mob, who had
pictures of him at a transvestite orgy.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.465
So America had a president
controlled by the Mafia?

15:00.338 --> 15:04.930
Soon after the election, the USSR were
allowed to install a nuclear base in Cuba

15:04.931 --> 15:08.842
in return for Mafia cocaine
trafficking between Cuba and the States.

15:08.843 --> 15:12.130
With a Soviet nuclear base
30 miles from the US mainland,

15:12.131 --> 15:14.341
people fled from all the major cities.

15:15.337 --> 15:19.451
So am I right in thinking I could get a
major nuclear explosion all over this suit?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.341
Cos I'm telling you guys, that
stuff does *not* dry clean!

15:24.342 --> 15:25.306
Back to Starbug.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.338
Starbug isn't there. It doesn't exist.

15:27.373 --> 15:28.356
What?

15:28.391 --> 15:29.305
How come?

15:29.340 --> 15:33.525
Er, best guess: Kennedy's impeachment
in '64 traumatised the American nation,

15:33.526 --> 15:36.637
allowing the USSR to win the space race.

15:36.638 --> 15:38.617
In this reality, it was
probably the Russians

15:38.618 --> 15:40.338
who were the first to land on the moon.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.337
So we're marooned.

15:42.335 --> 15:46.337
How was I supposed to know that chicken
vindaloo was going to cause all this.

15:46.372 --> 15:48.337
But you guys said Kennedy was a great pres!

15:48.372 --> 15:49.303
He was!

15:49.338 --> 15:52.465
He was also an inveterate womaniser;
his affairs were legendary.

15:52.466 --> 15:54.341
They never came out when he was alive.

15:54.376 --> 15:57.333
Every man has his weak
spot, his 'Achilles heel'.

15:57.368 --> 15:59.338
Kennedy's was just, higher up.

16:01.334 --> 16:05.101
If I'd known this was gonna happen, I'd have
had an egg sarnie, and finished the Cinzano.

16:05.902 --> 16:08.338
Kryten, what've I done, man?

16:08.373 --> 16:12.338
Well, you've brought the 20th century to
the very brink of extinction, sir. Gum?

16:13.334 --> 16:16.079
What is wrong with you?
Where is your compassion?

16:16.080 --> 16:19.318
You've got about as much warmth
as a service station chip!

16:19.319 --> 16:22.337
That's right, you've no
behaviour protocols, have you.

16:23.334 --> 16:25.666
Any you thought causality didn't matter?

16:26.167 --> 16:30.331
Every action we take, has trillions of
implications, how come you forgot that?

16:30.366 --> 16:33.332
Well, I didn't forget, sir, I just
didn't care. I've got no guilt.

16:34.336 --> 16:39.339
Ah. I nicked Kryten's body. That's
spare head 2; I removed his guilt chip.

16:42.336 --> 16:47.121
You, have altered the entire course of
civilisation from the 20th century onwards,

16:47.122 --> 16:51.329
you've brought the world to the brink
of nuclear war, and worst of all -

16:51.364 --> 16:53.847
I know, I know; I still
haven't had a curry.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.330
No, worst of all, the Time Drive has frozen.

16:57.331 --> 16:58.031
Let me see.

17:01.331 --> 17:03.380
Do you think its because
the sub-space conduits

17:03.381 --> 17:05.344
have locked with the
transponder calibrations

17:05.345 --> 17:08.333
and caused a major tachyon surge
that has overloaded the time matrix?

17:08.367 --> 17:10.333
Ah, no, sir; I've just
been jabbing it too hard.

17:12.334 --> 17:13.330
So what now?

17:16.332 --> 17:18.864
We need to have time to
figure out how to unfreeze it.

17:18.865 --> 17:20.935
I suggest we, set up
camp here for the night

17:20.936 --> 17:23.329
and perhaps *Kryten* can
go and look for some food?

17:23.365 --> 17:24.333
I'm on my way, sir!

17:30.561 --> 17:32.560
It's hopeless, I can't
fix it. We're trapped...

17:37.566 --> 17:38.572
Chicken's good.

17:38.607 --> 17:39.579
Yeah, really good.

17:41.580 --> 17:42.578
That's not chicken, sir.

17:43.580 --> 17:44.577
Oh, what is it?

17:45.576 --> 17:46.580
It's that man we found.

17:49.577 --> 17:51.464
Well, it seemed such
a waste to leave him

17:51.465 --> 17:53.575
lying there when he'd
barbecue so beautifully.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.579
Did I do wrong? I didn't
get any error commands...

18:00.575 --> 18:04.450
Obviously I thought about it, because
without my guilt chip or moral imperatives,

18:04.451 --> 18:08.137
I have nothing to guide me. But it
seemed to me that if humanoids eat chicken

18:08.138 --> 18:10.264
then obviously they'd
eat their own species;

18:10.265 --> 18:12.579
otherwise they'd just be
picking on the chicken.

18:13.573 --> 18:16.573
One minute you're down, the
next you're right back up again.

18:17.576 --> 18:19.577
I said I was enjoying that!

18:20.574 --> 18:23.572
I knew it didn't smell right! Oh my god...

18:24.573 --> 18:25.585
I'm a cannibal!

18:29.573 --> 18:30.572
Look!

18:31.575 --> 18:34.149
Right, lets get out of
here! I badly need to floss

18:34.150 --> 18:36.572
a piece of roasted dead
person out of my teeth!

18:38.576 --> 18:39.376
Where to?

18:39.572 --> 18:40.572
Hawaii. Let's catch some surf!

18:42.572 --> 18:47.575
No, no, we've got to go back; stop ourselves
from interfering with the assassination.

18:48.574 --> 18:51.572
I don't care where we go, just as
long as it's before we had dinner!

18:59.571 --> 19:01.571
Decorators. Try up on the sixth floor.

19:19.572 --> 19:22.271
Stand back, sir, our original
selves are about to beam in.

19:22.272 --> 19:24.834
When they realise their
mistake they'll beam out again.

19:24.835 --> 19:26.572
I propose *we* go down to the fourth.

19:29.574 --> 19:30.568
First shot!

19:34.568 --> 19:36.572
It doesn't smell right, I think he's missed!

19:37.571 --> 19:40.127
He's right, sir. By sending
Oswald up to the sixth,

19:40.128 --> 19:43.567
we've made the trajectory of his
shot so steep he's only wounded him.

19:44.571 --> 19:46.535
Let's start again, and bring
him back down to the fifth.

19:46.570 --> 19:48.880
We can't use the fifth: our
original selves are destined

19:48.881 --> 19:50.704
to beam in there as he
fires his third shot,

19:50.705 --> 19:52.569
and this version of us
are now on the fourth.

19:53.571 --> 19:55.106
We've been copied more times than

19:55.107 --> 19:57.572
that poster of the tennis
girl scratching her butt.

19:58.579 --> 20:00.476
If we could arrange, somehow,
for a second gunman to fire

20:00.477 --> 20:02.569
from just behind that little
hill over there covered in lawn...

20:03.565 --> 20:05.565
You mean the, er, the grassy knoll, sir?

20:06.567 --> 20:07.570
That'd solve it, wouldn't it?

20:07.605 --> 20:09.568
Shoot the pres? Who?

20:10.565 --> 20:11.572
You can count me out.

20:11.607 --> 20:12.569
And me.

20:14.568 --> 20:20.563
Hang on... maybe, just maybe there's
someone who can get us out of this mess.

20:20.598 --> 20:21.533
Where are we going?

20:21.568 --> 20:26.566
Idlewild airport, July, '65...

20:43.564 --> 20:47.292
This is right. He's being escorted
to Hoover open prison in New York.

20:47.293 --> 20:48.570
Give me *five minutes*.

20:53.561 --> 20:56.566
Don't be alarmed, sir, but I
have a very strange tale to tell.

20:57.774 --> 21:02.542
I, ah, have had plenty of time to
reflect on my deeds in the Whitehouse.

21:02.543 --> 21:06.070
In all important respects
I believe I did a good job.

21:06.071 --> 21:08.943
It was right to plan
a pull out of Vietnam,

21:08.944 --> 21:12.535
to fight for civil rights,
and, ah, to fight congress,

21:12.536 --> 21:14.494
ah, to put a man on the moon.

21:14.495 --> 21:19.000
It was, ah, wrong however, to, ah,
act like an irresponsible jackass

21:19.001 --> 21:23.767
with all those women, and allow my
enemies to wreak havoc on our nation.

21:24.769 --> 21:27.767
But I can help, man. I mean,
Mr. President, man. I mean, sir.

21:28.766 --> 21:30.767
How, ah, can you help?

21:31.770 --> 21:35.732
Well, come with us back to Dallas,
November 1963, be a second gunman.

21:35.733 --> 21:37.770
The gunman behind the grassy knoll.

21:39.765 --> 21:42.771
You mean, assassinate myself?

21:43.772 --> 21:46.764
Yeah! It'll drive the conspiracy nuts
crazy, but they'll never figure it out.

21:48.770 --> 21:53.126
But I, ah, still have a future
here. Jackie left me, but, ah,

21:53.127 --> 21:57.764
when I get out I can, ah, still
make a contribution to the world.

21:58.769 --> 22:03.789
See this airport, Idlewild airport? In our
reality they renamed it 'JFK', after you.

22:03.790 --> 22:08.397
Where I come from you're a liberal icon,
and that's the person you should be.

22:08.398 --> 22:12.767
If you're gonna be that person, you're
gonna have to sacrifice your life.

22:14.763 --> 22:17.762
And only then will my reputation
be restored in history?

22:18.763 --> 22:19.763
Mm. And I can get a smeggin' curry.

22:23.769 --> 22:29.761
Ask not what your country can do for you...
ask what you can do for your country.

22:30.763 --> 22:32.761
Hey, that'd make a pretty neat speech, that.

22:33.768 --> 22:34.766
It did. Heh heh.

23:07.758 --> 23:12.762
I, ah, thank you all for giving me
the opportunity to, ah, be reborn.

23:36.762 --> 23:40.758
Smeg! I forgot to ask if there
are any curry houses in Dallas!
